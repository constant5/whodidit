0	00:00:56	00:00:58	I was the driver on patrol.
1	00:00:58	00:01:02	Heard gunfire, called it in, responded.
2	00:01:02	00:01:05	Saw the suspect with a gun firing in a southwest direction.
3	00:01:05	00:01:08	Told my partner to call for backup.
4	00:01:08	00:01:12	Fearing for someone's life, I exited the vehicle and engaged the suspect.
5	00:01:12	00:01:14	I fired three rounds.
6	00:01:15	00:01:16	Suspect went down.
7	00:01:16	00:01:20	I approached, kicked the gun away, handcuffed him.
8	00:01:20	00:01:21	Okay.
9	00:01:21	00:01:24	25 years on the job, Jim.
10	00:01:24	00:01:27	First time I ever had to fire my weapon.
11	00:01:27	00:01:28	What was your partner's name?
12	00:01:29	00:01:30	Donna Grayson.
13	00:01:30	00:01:32	First week on patrol.
14	00:01:33	00:01:35	Officer Grayson, we're ready to take you downtown now.
15	00:01:35	00:01:37	We're gonna need your statement, too, Danny.
16	00:01:37	00:01:39	Yeah, I know the drill. Okay.
17	00:01:39	00:01:43	Hey. We've been getting way too much business out of this neighborhood, Jim.
18	00:01:43	00:01:48	Well, if the gangs in L.A. would stay in L.A., life in the ghetto would be beautiful again.
19	00:01:48	00:01:50	What does it look like, David?
20	00:01:52	00:01:58	one to the left kidney area; one to the left thigh; and one to the upper torso.
21	00:01:59	00:02:02	At least one of them was a through-and-through.
22	00:02:05	00:02:08	A nine-millimeter hollow-point.
23	00:02:08	00:02:10	This looks like our duty issue.
24	00:02:10	00:02:12	Smith &amp; Wesson Model 60.
25	00:02:12	00:02:14	.38 Special.
26	00:02:14	00:02:16	Suspect fired four rounds.
27	00:02:16	00:02:21	Well, that's consistent with Officer Finn's statement.
28	00:02:21	00:02:23	Hey, brother! Let me talk to you!
29	00:02:23	00:02:25	That's right. I'm talking to you.
30	00:02:25	00:02:27	Damn cop shot him after he was down.
31	00:02:29	00:02:31	Plain murder.
32	00:02:31	00:02:32	Murder!
33	00:02:32	00:02:33	She's speaking the truth!
34	00:02:33	00:02:35	It was murder!
35	00:02:35	00:02:39	Murder! Would they be crying murder if he was a white guy?
36	00:02:41	00:02:43	It's not about this guy.
37	00:02:43	00:02:45	It's never about one guy.
38	00:02:46	00:02:48	We'll be taking all their statements. Let's keep going.
39	00:02:48	00:02:50	David, would you go ahead and roll him, please?
40	00:03:04	00:03:08	We have another nine-mil hollow-point.
41	00:03:08	00:03:11	Well, there are a lot of ways a bullet could end up under his body.
42	00:03:11	00:03:20	shot from a distance through-and-through, bullet got caught in his clothing, fell out when he went down; or...
43	00:03:21	00:03:25	the suspect was shot after he was down, like the young lady said.
44	00:03:25	00:03:26	Coup de grâce.
45	00:03:26	00:03:28	Sounds like you already made up your mind.
46	00:03:28	00:03:31	You already made up yours?
47	00:03:32	00:03:34	Ray.
48	00:03:38	00:03:39	Jim? Yeah?
49	00:03:40	00:03:42	This man is a cop.
50	00:03:42	00:03:43	Oh, no.
51	00:03:43	00:03:45	Sergeant Scott Johnson.
52	00:03:45	00:03:47	Lives in Seven Hills. (groans)
53	00:03:47	00:03:49	What are you doing down here, my man?
54	00:03:49	00:03:51	I'll find out.
55	00:03:51	00:03:54	First I have to notify Ecklie.
56	00:03:54	00:03:56	Conrad, Jim Brass.
57	00:03:58	00:04:00	Eyes are gonna be on every move we make.
58	00:04:00	00:04:03	They already are.
59	00:04:04	00:04:06	Tired of this! Shot him in the back!
60	00:05:00	00:05:05	Hey, you know as well as I do-- if there's one gun, there's two; if there's two guys, there's three.
61	00:05:05	00:05:07	It's how I was trained; it's how I train the rookies.
62	00:05:07	00:05:09	You don't have to defend your actions.
63	00:05:09	00:05:12	I'm just here to document them for the record. (door opens)
64	00:05:12	00:05:15	CSI Willows has entered the room.
65	00:05:15	00:05:19	She is here to collect and document your service weapon.
66	00:05:19	00:05:23	Actually, I'd like to ask a few questions first.
67	00:05:23	00:05:25	This is a sketch of the...
68	00:05:25	00:05:28	900 block of Adams Street, where the shooting took place.
69	00:05:28	00:05:35	Officer Finn, could you indicate the position of the suspect and where you were when you fired? Suspect was...
70	00:05:35	00:05:37	here.
71	00:05:37	00:05:43	For the record, Officer Finn has indicated that the suspect was in the parking lot of White House Burgers, south of the building.
72	00:05:43	00:05:45	I parked my vehicle here.
73	00:05:45	00:05:47	I fired behind the driver's door.
74	00:05:47	00:05:49	Also in the parking lot, north of the suspect.
75	00:05:49	00:05:51	And you never fired from any other position?
76	00:05:51	00:05:53	No, I fired three.
77	00:05:53	00:05:55	From behind my door.
78	00:05:55	00:05:59	When did the suspect go down?
79	00:05:59	00:06:02	On the third shot.
80	00:06:02	00:06:06	At what point did you approach the suspect?
81	00:06:06	00:06:08	When I felt the suspect was no longer a threat.
82	00:06:08	00:06:09	When he was down.
83	00:06:12	00:06:15	Somebody saying something different?
84	00:06:15	00:06:19	Well, preliminary eyewitness reports suggest...
85	00:06:19	00:06:23	that the suspect was shot in the back after he was down.
86	00:06:23	00:06:26	So far the physical evidence doesn't disprove it.
87	00:06:26	00:06:28	Well, it didn't happen.
88	00:06:28	00:06:29	Ask my partner.
89	00:06:32	00:06:34	You gonna tell me what's going on here?
90	00:06:34	00:06:35	Did you recognize him?
91	00:06:35	00:06:37	No.
92	00:06:37	00:06:38	Did you I.D. yourself to him?
93	00:06:38	00:06:40	I don't know. Maybe.
94	00:06:40	00:06:42	Did you give him a chance to I.D. himself to you?
95	00:06:42	00:06:43	Hell, no. Why would I?
96	00:06:43	00:06:45	Because he was a cop.
97	00:06:45	00:06:48	Sergeant Scott Johnson.
98	00:06:54	00:06:56	That's it.
99	00:06:56	00:06:59	I'm not saying another word until my union attorney gets here.
100	00:06:59	00:07:07	If Finn fired three shots from behind his door in that direction, cartridge cases would have ejected right... and rear.
101	00:07:07	00:07:10	They should be around here somewhere.
102	00:07:13	00:07:15	I think I got one.
103	00:07:27	00:07:30	Make that two.
104	00:07:33	00:07:35	One to go.
105	00:07:35	00:07:39	He shot out of there like a bolt of lightning.
106	00:07:39	00:07:41	So you saw him leave the restaurant?
107	00:07:41	00:07:45	I'm saying, where's that other guy, the one I was talking to in the parking lot?
108	00:07:45	00:07:46	You know who I mean.
109	00:07:46	00:07:48	Well, you got me.
110	00:07:51	00:07:55	(sighs) Did you, uh, see anybody on the street?
111	00:07:55	00:07:56	Anything unusual?
112	00:07:56	00:07:59	Not till all that gunfire started, and that's not all that unusual.
113	00:07:59	00:08:01	Okay.
114	00:08:01	00:08:03	What happened when you heard the shots?
115	00:08:03	00:08:05	I grabbed my baby, and I hit the ground.
116	00:08:05	00:08:06	Your baby?
117	00:08:06	00:08:08	My boy, Avery.
118	00:08:08	00:08:10	Six years old.
119	00:08:10	00:08:12	Bring him with me to work.
120	00:08:12	00:08:14	Sitters cost too much.
121	00:08:14	00:08:16	Could you see who was shooting?
122	00:08:16	00:08:17	I saw the floor.
123	00:08:17	00:08:18	And when did you go outside?
124	00:08:18	00:08:20	When it got quiet.
125	00:08:20	00:08:22	Can you show me where you were standing?
126	00:08:23	00:08:24	Right here.
127	00:08:24	00:08:26	Right outside the door.
128	00:08:26	00:08:27	What did you see?
129	00:08:27	00:08:29	I saw the brother murdered.
130	00:08:29	00:08:33	Here. The cop was standing over him, and he shot him.
131	00:08:33	00:08:38	But you just said that you waited until the shooting stopped before you went outside.
132	00:08:38	00:08:41	I know what I saw and what I heard.
133	00:08:41	00:08:44	There was a whole bunch of guns going off.
134	00:08:44	00:08:45	Then it got quiet.
135	00:08:45	00:08:50	Then one last shot, and that cop was standing over that poor man.
136	00:08:50	00:08:52	I saw a murder.
137	00:09:00	00:09:05	Well, if that's what happened, Officer Finn's gun would have been pointed at the ground.
138	00:09:05	00:09:09	That cartridge case...
139	00:09:09	00:09:11	ejected.
140	00:09:27	00:09:29	Nine-millimeter cartridge case.
141	00:09:29	00:09:32	Consistent with witness statements.
142	00:09:32	00:09:35	And inconsistent with the officer's statement.
143	00:09:37	00:09:39	Sara, glad to see you back.
144	00:09:39	00:09:40	Ecklie.
145	00:09:40	00:09:42	How was your week off in Paris?
146	00:09:42	00:09:43	Dr. Grissom sends his regards.
147	00:09:43	00:09:47	Were you able to make notification? Well, Johnson's only next-of-kin is his father.
148	00:09:47	00:09:48	Looks like he's out of town.
149	00:09:48	00:09:51	Any word on what Johnson was doing down there?
150	00:09:51	00:09:57	Well, according to Johnson's captain, he was off duty; Adams Street isn't in his district; he wasn't working undercover; and he had no informants.
151	00:09:57	00:09:59	So no official reason to be there.
152	00:09:59	00:10:03	Which is why you are here.
153	00:10:03	00:10:08	Maybe Sergeant Johnson was just looking for a good burger.
154	00:10:08	00:10:10	I doubt it.
155	00:10:10	00:10:12	Take a look at his body fat.
156	00:10:12	00:10:14	Not the usual yellow-orange color.
157	00:10:14	00:10:16	It's white. He was a vegetarian.
158	00:10:17	00:10:19	So what was he doing in a burger joint?
159	00:10:19	00:10:21	Do you have the third bullet?
160	00:10:25	00:10:26	Nine-mil.
161	00:10:26	00:10:29	Lodged in his left kidney, not immediately fatal.
162	00:10:29	00:10:33	Same as the one shot through his left thigh.
163	00:10:33	00:10:35	This one's your COD.
164	00:10:35	00:10:37	Back-to-front.
165	00:10:37	00:10:39	Penetrated the interventricular septum near the base of the heart.
166	00:10:40	00:10:42	That's the area concerned with its electrical conduction.
167	00:10:45	00:10:47	Kind of like flipping the main breaker.
168	00:10:47	00:10:49	Heart would have stopped immediately.
169	00:10:49	00:10:50	So it must have been the final shot.
170	00:10:50	00:10:53	Does the trajectory tell you if he was standing or prone?
171	00:10:53	00:10:57	That is the question of the night, and I can't give you an answer.
172	00:10:57	00:11:07	You know, in ancient times, a coup de grâce was considered an act of mercy-- a quick blow to end the suffering of a comrade wounded in battle.
173	00:11:07	00:11:11	Whatever this was, it was no act of mercy.
174	00:11:49	00:11:51	How's the House of Meat?
175	00:11:51	00:11:55	Sergeant Johnson ordered two burgers, two drinks, and a salad.
176	00:11:55	00:11:57	Burgers were not for him. He was a vegetarian.
177	00:11:57	00:12:01	According to the witnesses, he entered alone.
178	00:12:01	00:12:03	So he must have been meeting someone.
179	00:12:03	00:12:04	Okay. Who?
180	00:12:04	00:12:08	And why haven't they come forward?
181	00:12:08	00:12:12	Officer Grayson, could you see who Sergeant Johnson was shooting at?
182	00:12:14	00:12:17	I don't think so.
183	00:12:17	00:12:19	It was all so fast.
184	00:12:19	00:12:21	I should have seen more.
185	00:12:21	00:12:23	I didn't.
186	00:12:24	00:12:26	Can we do this a little later?
187	00:12:26	00:12:28	A officer lost his life last night.
188	00:12:28	00:12:31	We owe it to him to get past ourselves and do what we have to do.
189	00:12:31	00:12:33	If you want to pound nails in your head, do it tomorrow.
190	00:12:33	00:12:35	Now, show me your position.
191	00:12:35	00:12:41	Um, I was right there, calling for backup.
192	00:12:41	00:12:44	And while you were on the radio, could you see Sergeant Johnson?
193	00:12:44	00:12:46	No.
194	00:12:46	00:12:47	Could you see your partner?
195	00:12:47	00:12:49	Yes.
196	00:12:49	00:12:51	Grayson, get the hell down.
197	00:12:51	00:12:53	Call for backup now.
198	00:12:53	00:12:55	Control, this is 3 David 34.
199	00:12:55	00:12:58	We have a 444 in progress, 900 block of Adams.
200	00:12:59	00:13:02	Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
201	00:13:02	00:13:05	Requesting backup and paramedics.
202	00:13:06	00:13:08	3 David 3-4, copy that. Will advise.
203	00:13:08	00:13:14	All units, vicinity of 900 block of Adams, be advised we have a 444 in progress. Officer involved.
204	00:13:15	00:13:19	So you didn't actually see Officer Finn fire the third shot?
205	00:13:19	00:13:20	I heard it.
206	00:13:20	00:13:23	It was close.
207	00:13:23	00:13:25	But by the time that I looked up...
208	00:13:28	00:13:30	Where was Officer Finn when you looked up?
209	00:13:30	00:13:34	Over the body.
210	00:13:39	00:13:42	Do you have the dispatch calls from Officer Finn's patrol car yet?
211	00:13:43	00:13:45	Is there a problem?
212	00:13:45	00:13:46	Deputy?
213	00:13:46	00:13:47	No, ma'am.
214	00:13:47	00:13:50	But Officer Finn's mic was stuck in the open position.
215	00:13:50	00:13:52	Happens all the time. Might be helpful.
216	00:13:52	00:13:55	Let's hear it.
217	00:13:55	00:13:57	Grayson, get the hell down!
218	00:13:57	00:13:58	Call for backup now!
219	00:13:58	00:14:01	Control, this is 3 David 34.
220	00:14:01	00:14:03	We have a 444 in progress.
221	00:14:05	00:14:06	I'm taking him down.
222	00:14:06	00:14:09	Black son of a bitch.
223	00:14:20	00:14:23	Jim, we need to talk about the...
224	00:14:23	00:14:25	Jim!
225	00:14:30	00:14:32	I put my credibility on the line for you.
226	00:14:32	00:14:35	CSI said excessive force. I said, No way.
227	00:14:35	00:14:37	That's right. Oh, really?
228	00:14:38	00:14:39	I'm taking him down.
229	00:14:39	00:14:41	Black son of a bitch.
230	00:14:43	00:14:44	Look, I don't remember saying that.
231	00:14:44	00:14:46	I'm advising you not to speak.
232	00:14:46	00:14:48	Not until we hear the complete recording and check the witness statements.
233	00:14:48	00:14:50	What, you think I'm racist?
234	00:14:50	00:14:51	Again, officer, I'm telling you...
235	00:14:51	00:14:55	I don't remember. If I said he was black, I was describing the suspect.
236	00:14:55	00:14:58	I was so focused on what the gun was doing, I...
237	00:14:58	00:14:59	Did you see his face?
238	00:14:59	00:15:00	No, it was dark out.
239	00:15:00	00:15:02	Are you telling me you didn't recognize Scott Johnson?
240	00:15:02	00:15:05	He was a trainee. He rode with you.
241	00:15:05	00:15:06	He was your damn partner for four months.
242	00:15:06	00:15:08	You spent eight hours a day in the car together.
243	00:15:08	00:15:10	You saw more of him than you did of your wife.
244	00:15:10	00:15:11	This was over five years ago.
245	00:15:11	00:15:17	So, you're telling me that you didn't recognize the guy who put a formal complaint in your file for racial discrimination?
246	00:15:17	00:15:19	Let me read this to you.
247	00:15:19	00:15:23	Frequent and excessive use of racial epithets, including the 'N' word.
248	00:15:23	00:15:28	First of all, no, I didn't recognize Johnson.
249	00:15:28	00:15:31	And second, yeah, sure, I use street talk with the trainees.
250	00:15:32	00:15:33	Come on, you know that doesn't fly anymore.
251	00:15:33	00:15:40	But believe me, whatever they get from me is nothing compared to what they're going to get from the real gorillas in the jungle. That's a poor choice of words.
252	00:15:40	00:15:42	I am training them for the real world.
253	00:15:42	00:15:51	And of the dozens and dozens of people that I have trained-- and that is every color of the rainbow, pal-- that hard-ass was the only one who ever complained.
254	00:15:51	00:15:53	The only one.
255	00:15:53	00:15:57	He's the racist, not me.
256	00:15:59	00:16:01	Ready, set, go.
257	00:16:06	00:16:07	Four seconds. (groans)
258	00:16:07	00:16:08	Could have run it in two.
259	00:16:08	00:16:12	Except we're timing a 53-year-old guy who's packing about 30 pounds of gear.
260	00:16:12	00:16:15	So, the distance from Finn's car to Johnson's body was 40 feet?
261	00:16:15	00:16:24	And according to the dispatch recording, there was 5.4 seconds that elapsed between the second and third shots.
262	00:16:24	00:16:29	Greg just proved that that's time enough for Finn to have delivered the final shot over the body.
263	00:16:31	00:16:34	Brass found out Finn put in for a promotion about a year ago.
264	00:16:34	00:16:35	It was denied.
265	00:16:35	00:16:42	A couple of weeks later, Finn saw Johnson at another officer's retirement party, took a swing at him.
266	00:16:42	00:16:47	Finn probably thought he deserved a desk job and a bigger pension and he blamed Johnson for not getting it.
267	00:16:47	00:16:52	Would Finn have delivered that coup de grâce, if that guy hadn't been Johnson?
268	00:16:52	00:16:56	But it was, and when Finn recognized him, his resentment probably took over.
269	00:16:56	00:16:57	Racially motivated, you think?
270	00:16:57	00:17:00	Well, obviously, race is a hot-button issue for the guy.
271	00:17:00	00:17:04	When I heard the dispatch recording, I hated what I heard. I thought, The guy's a racist.
272	00:17:04	00:17:07	But it may not be that simple.
273	00:17:07	00:17:08	I mean, it was a stress situation.
274	00:17:08	00:17:14	And people say things they would never, ever say in a normal setting.
275	00:17:14	00:17:15	Don't we?
276	00:17:17	00:17:22	You know, there was a study done back in Michigan about a year or so ago.
277	00:17:22	00:17:29	It, uh, examined an officer's response to situations involving deadly force and whether race is a factor.
278	00:17:29	00:17:35	It found that an officer has less than a third of a second to decide whether to use his gun.
279	00:17:35	00:17:36	That's not much time.
280	00:17:36	00:17:38	It's enough for an instinctive response.
281	00:17:38	00:17:46	Yes, but the study showed, overwhelmingly, that the most important factor in an officer's response is the suspect's actions, not race.
282	00:17:47	00:17:49	I'm not talking about racial profiling.
283	00:17:49	00:17:51	That's a whole other box of crayons.
284	00:17:51	00:17:56	I'm talking about that third of a second when a threat jumps out at you.
285	00:18:02	00:18:03	Look...
286	00:18:03	00:18:11	when I had a gun pulled on me, I didn't check for skin color before I pulled the trigger.
287	00:18:13	00:18:14	Finn's motives are not what we're after.
288	00:18:14	00:18:17	Just the evidence that's going to tell us about his actions.
289	00:18:17	00:18:22	We got a 420 at an abandoned school on Madison, north of Fifth.
290	00:18:23	00:18:25	I'll take it. Okay.
291	00:18:27	00:18:30	And life goes on.
292	00:18:33	00:18:37	If I need to call you, I'm going to. That's cool?
293	00:18:37	00:18:38	Thanks.
294	00:18:40	00:18:41	Moreno. Sara.
295	00:18:41	00:18:43	Skater found the body.
296	00:18:43	00:18:45	It looks like a gang execution.
297	00:18:45	00:18:47	The victim's just a kid.
298	00:18:51	00:18:53	Body's in full rigor.
299	00:18:53	00:18:55	TOD was about 16 hours ago.
300	00:18:55	00:18:57	00 last night.
301	00:18:57	00:18:58	It was a busy hour in the neighborhood.
302	00:18:58	00:19:01	This was why my parents moved from L.A. to Vegas.
303	00:19:02	00:19:04	So I wouldn't end up like that.
304	00:19:04	00:19:06	GSW to the neck.
305	00:19:06	00:19:09	It's a through-and-through.
306	00:19:15	00:19:16	Got a bullet here.
307	00:19:18	00:19:21	Nine-mil.
308	00:19:21	00:19:23	Everybody loves their nines, huh?
309	00:19:23	00:19:25	Good guys, bad guys. My mom.
310	00:19:25	00:19:28	I don't see any cartridge casings.
311	00:19:28	00:19:30	Homeboys are catching finally on and policing their brass.
312	00:19:32	00:19:33	He's missing a finger.
313	00:19:35	00:19:37	When you get him on the table, look in his rectum.
314	00:19:38	00:19:39	You'll find his finger there.
315	00:19:40	00:19:43	So that's what gangs are doing to snitches these days?
316	00:19:43	00:19:45	How do you know he's a snitch?
317	00:19:45	00:19:47	He got shot through the throat.
318	00:19:49	00:19:53	Trajectory was upwards, front to back.
319	00:19:53	00:19:55	David, can I see the entry? Yeah.
320	00:20:00	00:20:03	No, please.
321	00:20:03	00:20:05	No! No!
322	00:20:05	00:20:08	Please! I'll stop! I'll stop! Please, no!
323	00:20:08	00:20:09	No! No!
324	00:20:12	00:20:13	Hmm.
325	00:20:19	00:20:20	Supplying or buying?
326	00:20:25	00:20:27	Got sneaker prints in blood.
327	00:20:27	00:20:29	Ball to toe.
328	00:20:29	00:20:34	They were running.
329	00:20:34	00:20:36	The tread detail is still sharp.
330	00:20:36	00:20:38	Sneakers were fairly new.
331	00:20:38	00:20:42	Probably just lifted them at the mall.
332	00:20:42	00:20:46	Blood drops traveling in the same direction.
333	00:20:46	00:20:49	Your suspect was wounded.
334	00:21:20	00:21:25	You know, I can't help but wonder how Officer Finn just happened to roll up on the very guy he had a beef with.
335	00:21:25	00:21:29	Yeah, who just happened to be in the middle of the hood, miles from home and shooting at something.
336	00:21:29	00:21:33	Presenting Finn with the perfect opportunity to exact revenge.
337	00:21:33	00:21:36	What do you think? You think it could have been a setup?
338	00:21:36	00:21:41	I don't know. I mean, he called in shots fired before he could even see that it was Johnson.
339	00:21:41	00:21:43	But if he planned it, he knew Johnson was there.
340	00:21:43	00:21:45	And his unwitting partner would give him credibility.
341	00:21:47	00:21:52	All right, so, what puts Johnson on Adams Street in the first place?
342	00:21:52	00:21:58	Well, his last call was to someone 59 pm.
343	00:21:58	00:22:02	07 p.m.
344	00:22:02	00:22:06	Looks like Johnson and this guy called each other several times over the last couple days.
345	00:22:07	00:22:08	All right, so maybe that's who he was meeting.
346	00:22:09	00:22:11	Could run the number on an AG warrant.
347	00:22:11	00:22:12	Or we could call him.
348	00:22:41	00:22:42	Hello?
349	00:22:42	00:22:44	Sara?
350	00:22:44	00:22:45	This is Nick.
351	00:22:46	00:22:47	Whose phone is this?
352	00:22:47	00:22:49	My John Doe's-- the dead kid.
353	00:22:50	00:22:53	His name's Anthony.
354	00:22:57	00:22:59	Victim's name was Anthony Lopez.
355	00:22:59	00:23:01	He lived with his mom in an apartment on Garfield.
356	00:23:01	00:23:02	She I.D.'d the body.
357	00:23:02	00:23:04	She said he wasn't involved with gangs.
358	00:23:04	00:23:05	Don't they all?
359	00:23:05	00:23:07	What did she say about the drugs he was carrying?
360	00:23:07	00:23:10	She said he never used, and his tox came back clean.
361	00:23:10	00:23:12	Did the mother know Sergeant Johnson?
362	00:23:12	00:23:14	No. And Johnson wasn't working gangs.
363	00:23:14	00:23:16	And Lopez did not have a record.
364	00:23:16	00:23:19	Sorry, Mom, this has gangs written all over it.
365	00:23:19	00:23:21	PD has a trial on some new gang software.
366	00:23:21	00:23:23	Call Detective Moreno and give it a try.
367	00:23:23	00:23:25	Yeah, okay.
368	00:23:33	00:23:34	All right, keep them out.
369	00:23:35	00:23:37	All right, folks, you heard the man. Stay behind the tape.
370	00:23:41	00:23:45	Okay, Danny, this is the standard after-shooting walk-through.
371	00:23:45	00:23:47	I'm CSI Stokes.
372	00:23:47	00:23:50	I'm going to be asking you a few questions, okay?
373	00:23:50	00:23:52	Why not? Everybody else is.
374	00:23:52	00:23:56	When you arrived on the scene, according to your statement, Officer Johnson had his gun drawn and was shooting.
375	00:23:56	00:23:57	Is that correct?
376	00:23:57	00:23:58	Yeah, that's right.
377	00:23:58	00:24:00	Could you see what he was shooting at?
378	00:24:02	00:24:05	I could not see his target.
379	00:24:05	00:24:06	I could not see his face.
380	00:24:06	00:24:08	But I saw the gun, and I saw him firing.
381	00:24:09	00:24:11	And that was, uh, that was in this direction, right?
382	00:24:11	00:24:12	No.
383	00:24:12	00:24:13	Turn to your right.
384	00:24:13	00:24:15	More.
385	00:24:17	00:24:18	That's it.
386	00:24:18	00:24:20	So he was facing away from you?
387	00:24:22	00:24:25	Why'd you make the decision to shoot?
388	00:24:25	00:24:26	Screw you.
389	00:24:26	00:24:27	What? Hey, hey, hey.
390	00:24:27	00:24:30	No, I am so sick of everybody and their kid brother second-guessing me.
391	00:24:30	00:24:31	Hey, I'm not second-guessing you!
392	00:24:31	00:24:35	You know what? If you knew anything, you'd know that a guy with a gun in this neighborhood...
393	00:24:35	00:24:36	Watch it. What?!
394	00:24:36	00:24:37	It's a black neighborhood.
395	00:24:37	00:24:38	Look at their faces.
396	00:24:38	00:24:39	Tell me I'm wrong. (crowd murmurs)
397	00:24:39	00:24:40	Don't go there.
398	00:24:40	00:24:43	It's you people I was trying to save! All right, shut up!
399	00:24:43	00:24:45	Mitch, get him out of here.
400	00:24:45	00:24:47	I put my life on the line every day for you people!
401	00:24:47	00:24:48	What have you ever done for me, huh?
402	00:24:49	00:24:50	You got a death wish, buddy?
403	00:24:50	00:24:51	And you know what?!
404	00:24:51	00:24:54	Every bad thing that happened to you people, it's not my fault.
405	00:24:54	00:24:55	Got it?!
406	00:24:55	00:24:57	It's not my fault!
407	00:24:57	00:24:58	Let's go.
408	00:24:58	00:24:59	Let go of me!
409	00:24:59	00:25:01	I can't defend this guy.
410	00:25:01	00:25:03	All right, all right, all right.
411	00:25:03	00:25:05	He's kind of prickly, isn't he?
412	00:25:05	00:25:06	Well, let's cut him some slack.
413	00:25:06	00:25:09	He's under a lot of pressure. You know.
414	00:25:09	00:25:12	Well, at least now we know where Johnson was shooting.
415	00:25:12	00:25:17	And I'm thinking it was Anthony Lopez that Johnson was meeting here.
416	00:25:17	00:25:20	And Johnson was shooting at whoever killed Anthony.
417	00:25:23	00:25:25	I got what looks like a bullet hole here, Jim.
418	00:25:28	00:25:30	Missing hubcaps, flat tire.
419	00:25:30	00:25:34	You don't park in this neighborhood unless your car's not worth stealing.
420	00:25:35	00:25:36	Look at that.
421	00:25:38	00:25:43	.38 expanded hollow-point, with what looks like traces of blood and tissue.
422	00:25:43	00:25:44	We'll find out.
423	00:25:44	00:25:46	Well, Johnson was shooting a .38.
424	00:25:49	00:25:51	Hey, Nick. Yeah?
425	00:25:51	00:25:53	I got a trail.
426	00:25:53	00:25:56	Yep.
427	00:25:56	00:25:57	Right here.
428	00:26:07	00:26:09	It's blood.
429	00:26:12	00:26:15	Whatever Johnson was shooting at, he hit.
430	00:26:15	00:26:21	All right, this program links evidence from gang-related crimes in a fraction of the time it used to take us to do it.
431	00:26:21	00:26:26	We input all the evidence we've got and compare it against the database, starting with ballistics.
432	00:26:26	00:26:29	Each dot represents a crime involving firearms.
433	00:26:29	00:26:31	And that, that's just the last year.
434	00:26:31	00:26:34	Wow. I leave town for a while and all hell breaks loose.
435	00:26:36	00:26:38	Pretty cool.
436	00:26:38	00:26:39	Showing you guys something new.
437	00:26:39	00:26:42	Let's hope it works.
438	00:26:42	00:26:43	Oh, it works.
439	00:26:44	00:26:48	You see? Four gangs favor jacketed hollow-point nine-mils.
440	00:26:50	00:26:51	All right, let's input the sneaker print.
441	00:26:55	00:27:01	exsanguination due to GSWs.
442	00:27:01	00:27:02	All right, we're down to two possible gangs.
443	00:27:02	00:27:05	Let's input the location where we found the victim-- Madison and Fifth.
444	00:27:11	00:27:12	D-Street Killers.
445	00:27:12	00:27:16	They run Garfield Street, where Lopez lived.
446	00:27:16	00:27:19	Adams is outside of their territory.
447	00:27:19	00:27:23	So, Anthony Lopez and Sergeant Johnson probably thought they were meeting somewhere safe.
448	00:27:23	00:27:26	Do you have a log of all the known D-Street Killers in the database?
449	00:27:26	00:27:29	Except the ones that are dead or incarcerated.
450	00:27:29	00:27:30	Yeah.
451	00:27:35	00:27:38	I'll round them up.
452	00:28:29	00:28:34	I analyzed the bullet that you found here, under Sergeant Johnson's body.
453	00:28:34	00:28:38	It had manufacturer's petroleum sealant on the base.
454	00:28:38	00:28:39	That's not uncommon.
455	00:28:40	00:28:41	It keeps moisture from getting into the cartridge.
456	00:28:42	00:28:45	Right, but I did not find any sealant on any of Finn's other bullets.
457	00:28:45	00:28:46	Which also is not uncommon.
458	00:28:46	00:28:49	Manufacturers often mix different batches of ammo.
459	00:28:49	00:28:51	Did you find sealant on any of the cartridge cases?
460	00:28:51	00:28:54	Bear with me, wise one.
461	00:28:54	00:28:58	There was no sealant on the cartridge case Nick found under the fence.
462	00:29:03	00:29:07	the cartridge case that you found in the windshield of the patrol car.
463	00:29:07	00:29:12	So the bullet we thought was the coup de grâce was fired from the cartridge case on the patrol car?
464	00:29:12	00:29:14	40 feet from Johnson.
465	00:29:14	00:29:16	That's not a coup de grâce.
466	00:29:16	00:29:21	And in addition to the sealant, there were denim fibers in the nose of the bullet found under Johnson.
467	00:29:21	00:29:22	He was wearing jeans.
468	00:29:26	00:29:29	He landed on top of the bullet that went through his leg.
469	00:29:29	00:29:32	The first bullet I found was the one that went through his back.
470	00:29:32	00:29:33	We can't be sure.
471	00:29:33	00:29:37	Without corresponding trace, we can't match bullets to cartridge cases.
472	00:29:37	00:29:41	There was trace on the cartridge case near the fence.
473	00:29:41	00:29:43	And this is where it gets really sticky.
474	00:29:43	00:29:50	Grape juice, corn syrup, fruit pectin, citric acid, sodium citrate.
475	00:29:51	00:29:52	It had grape jelly on it?
476	00:29:52	00:29:54	Yes.
477	00:29:54	00:29:57	And there was a fingerprint.
478	00:29:57	00:30:00	Mandy ran it-- no hits.
479	00:30:00	00:30:05	If there was jelly on the cartridge before it was fired, it would have burned off in the chamber.
480	00:30:05	00:30:09	So somebody had to have touched it after it was fired.
481	00:30:09	00:30:11	Which means somebody moved the evidence.
482	00:30:11	00:30:13	The scene was secure within minutes.
483	00:30:13	00:30:19	The only people that were there were Officers Finn and Grayson and the witnesses at the burger joint.
484	00:30:19	00:30:23	Which doesn't serve breakfast-- only burgers, fries, and ice cream.
485	00:30:23	00:30:25	No jelly in the kitchen or on the menu.
486	00:30:25	00:30:26	But check this out.
487	00:30:26	00:30:29	There's a jelly packet.
488	00:30:29	00:30:32	Right by the toy truck.
489	00:30:32	00:30:35	I know who touched the cartridge case.
490	00:30:35	00:30:38	I like French fries with jelly.
491	00:30:39	00:30:45	Puts grape jelly on everything-- macaroni, eggs, carrots.
492	00:30:45	00:30:48	I take those jelly packs from breakfast spots, so I always have some handy.
493	00:30:48	00:30:52	Else-wise, baby won't eat at all.
494	00:30:52	00:30:58	Avery, last night, when everybody ran outside, did you touch anything?
495	00:30:58	00:30:59	He didn't touch anything.
496	00:30:59	00:31:02	It was all I could do to keep him from having to see that...
497	00:31:03	00:31:05	that man that was sick in the parking lot.
498	00:31:10	00:31:13	I'd like your consent to run his fingerprints.
499	00:31:13	00:31:19	Could help us clear up a critical part of our investigation.
500	00:31:25	00:31:28	Avery, can you do this with your finger?
501	00:31:28	00:31:30	Put it right there.
502	00:31:30	00:31:31	All right, that's good.
503	00:31:37	00:31:40	He did find something.
504	00:31:50	00:31:51	What you doing?
505	00:31:51	00:31:53	Put that down.
506	00:31:57	00:32:00	He didn't know what he was doing.
507	00:32:00	00:32:02	He's not in any trouble, ma'am.
508	00:32:02	00:32:10	But he did help us prove that Officer Finn didn't hurt Sergeant Johnson after he was already down.
509	00:32:15	00:32:21	Witnesses often merge what they actually saw with prior assumptions.
510	00:32:34	00:32:40	Well, good news is, CSIs proved you didn't commit a coup de grâce.
511	00:32:40	00:32:42	The bad news?
512	00:32:42	00:32:45	Excuse me.
513	00:32:49	00:32:51	You're still on administrative leave.
514	00:32:51	00:32:58	Because of your recent outburst, they aren't gonna issue you a replacement weapon until you get cleared by a department shrink.
515	00:32:58	00:33:02	When you shot a cop, is that what you did, Jim?
516	00:33:02	00:33:04	Did you cry on some couch to a shrink?
517	00:33:04	00:33:06	Come on, Danny. Come on.
518	00:33:08	00:33:10	I know the deal. I know the depression.
519	00:33:10	00:33:12	But you know, you should look at the bright side.
520	00:33:12	00:33:15	You're on paid leave, so why don't you go somewhere?
521	00:33:15	00:33:18	Take a vacation. Go to a beach. Go play golf.
522	00:33:18	00:33:20	Go make love to your wife in the afternoon.
523	00:33:24	00:33:28	That's what I'll do. That's what I'll do.
524	00:33:28	00:33:30	And then Johnson won't be dead anymore.
525	00:33:32	00:33:34	Hey, hey, come on, come on. Hey, listen.
526	00:33:34	00:33:37	Listen to me. I'll give it to you straight.
527	00:33:37	00:33:41	The lawsuits and the investigation are gonna take, like, forever, all right?
528	00:33:41	00:33:43	So why don't you do yourself a favor?
529	00:33:43	00:33:45	You got many years in this job.
530	00:33:45	00:33:48	Why don't you think about retirement?
531	00:33:48	00:33:51	This could be the time to get out.
532	00:33:51	00:33:53	And get out clean.
533	00:34:04	00:34:08	Would you be telling me to quit if Johnson had been white?
534	00:34:20	00:34:28	So, it wasn't that long ago that my wife died and Scott moved back home with me.
535	00:34:28	00:34:31	Said he didn't want me...
536	00:34:31	00:34:34	he didn't want me to be alone.
537	00:34:34	00:34:37	That white cop...
538	00:34:37	00:34:39	This was revenge.
539	00:34:41	00:34:43	The elevators are this way, Mr. Johnson.
540	00:34:48	00:34:52	He was in that neighborhood last night trying to save a kid's life.
541	00:34:52	00:34:54	Spanish kid.
542	00:34:54	00:34:56	Got caught shoplifting in a jewelry store.
543	00:34:56	00:34:59	Part of some kind of gang initiation.
544	00:34:59	00:35:03	He only did it because he didn't think he had a choice.
545	00:35:09	00:35:11	My Scotty got the owner not to press charges.
546	00:35:11	00:35:14	Told him he would be a mentor to the boy.
547	00:35:14	00:35:17	Gave him his phone number and he checked with him every day.
548	00:35:17	00:35:20	He was a good man.
549	00:35:20	00:35:22	We have all of Scott's personal effects downstairs.
550	00:35:59	00:36:00	Wait, Mr. Johnson.
551	00:36:00	00:36:02	I'll meet you in the lobby.
552	00:37:12	00:37:14	Open your mouth, please.
553	00:37:16	00:37:19	Open your mouth.
554	00:37:19	00:37:20	Delinquente...
555	00:37:21	00:37:23	delinquente...
556	00:37:23	00:37:26	Si tu no hagas lo que quiere, tu no sales de aqui, okay?
557	00:37:27	00:37:30	Can I see the bottom of your shoes, please?
558	00:37:30	00:37:32	Hágalo.
559	00:37:36	00:37:38	Eso duele!
560	00:37:39	00:37:41	Oh.
561	00:37:44	00:37:46	Let go of my leg! (groaning)
562	00:37:46	00:37:48	What's wrong with your leg?
563	00:37:48	00:37:49	None of your business.
564	00:37:49	00:37:51	Let the rest of them go.
565	00:37:51	00:37:53	Actually, run 'em for warrants.
566	00:38:00	00:38:02	Drop your pants.
567	00:38:08	00:38:11	If there's a bullet in his ass, his ass is evidence.
568	00:38:12	00:38:14	It's killing me, man. Get it out.
569	00:38:14	00:38:17	First you tell us what Anthony Lopez did to piss you off.
570	00:38:17	00:38:18	Anthony who?
571	00:38:20	00:38:22	Answer the question.
572	00:38:24	00:38:29	Punk thought by muling some crank he'd make me think he wasn't snitching. I knew better.
573	00:38:29	00:38:33	The snitch was gonna talk to that cop.
574	00:38:33	00:38:35	No way I was letting that happen.
575	00:38:35	00:38:38	Next thing I know, cop's shooting at me.
576	00:38:38	00:38:42	Cop got his. I got out of there.
577	00:38:42	00:38:43	That's it, I swear.
578	00:38:43	00:38:47	Just don't hit me no more.
579	00:38:58	00:39:08	They say a suicide attempt is a cry for help, but from the size of this hole, I'd say we have an admission of guilt.
580	00:39:10	00:39:15	Have you ever been with someone at the moment they died, David?
581	00:39:15	00:39:18	Actually... no.
582	00:39:18	00:39:23	Well, my eyes were the last ones that he looked into.
583	00:39:26	00:39:30	I just wonder...
584	00:39:37	00:39:41	David, have you seen these bruises?
585	00:39:41	00:39:44	Yeah, they look just like my grandmother's knees.
586	00:39:46	00:39:48	She is always bumping into things.
587	00:40:59	00:41:03	Nick, would you go stand where Sergeant Johnson was shooting, please?
588	00:41:03	00:41:05	Yes, sir.
589	00:41:05	00:41:08	We've already proved there was no coup de grâce.
590	00:41:08	00:41:10	What is this gonna show us?
591	00:41:10	00:41:14	We still haven't determined whether or not Officer Finn recognized Sergeant Johnson when he shot him.
592	00:41:14	00:41:23	Nick, go ahead and assume a shooting stance, please, Take this, put it up to your eyes and look at Nick.
593	00:41:24	00:41:34	I noticed multiple bruises in various stages of healing on Officer Finn's legs right about coffee table height.
594	00:41:34	00:41:38	I also noticed there were a lot of dings on his car when I went to the garage.
595	00:41:38	00:41:43	Now that you mention it, the left front fender of his patrol car had a dent.
596	00:41:44	00:41:51	So, post-mortem on his eyes revealed hyperplastic formations in the mid-peripheral retina.
597	00:41:51	00:41:55	His vision was severely impaired by retinitis pigmentosa.
598	00:41:56	00:41:57	It's like seeing the world through a straw.
599	00:41:57	00:41:59	And it's progressive.
600	00:41:59	00:42:03	Vision in both eyes slowly irises down over time.
601	00:42:03	00:42:05	No way he should have been working patrol then.
602	00:42:05	00:42:06	That's for sure.
603	00:42:07	00:42:11	Probably too proud to go out on a disability, even though it's a better pension.
604	00:42:11	00:42:15	I have to say he was a pretty good shot for a blind guy.
605	00:42:15	00:42:21	Ironically, because his vision was so constrained, he was able to focus on the immediate threat.
606	00:42:21	00:42:23	And there's one more thing.
607	00:42:23	00:42:33	Officer Finn's patrol car was parked at an angle where his headlights wouldn't have picked up Johnson, which means that that light put him in silhouette.
608	00:42:44	00:42:48	his condition, at night with this lighting.
609	00:42:48	00:42:51	Finn couldn't have known it was Johnson.
610	00:42:51	00:42:58	Finn took action in the line of duty, and Johnson was trying to help a kid at risk.
611	00:43:00	00:43:02	So where's the bad guy in this?
612	00:43:04	00:43:06	You tell me.
