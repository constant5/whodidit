0	00:00:29	00:00:36	You can breathalyze me all you want, but the broad came right at me, I swear.
1	00:00:36	00:00:38	It wasn't my fault.
2	00:00:38	00:00:44	Ooh, that's what happens when 6,000 pounds of thrust meets three feet of hood.
3	00:00:44	00:00:46	This was not a fair fight.
4	00:00:55	00:00:58	Well, now, how did she end up way over here?
5	00:00:58	00:01:02	There must be 20 feet of rubber burned into this asphalt.
6	00:01:02	00:01:05	She was braking hard.
7	00:01:05	00:01:07	She definitely swerved out of her lane.
8	00:01:09	00:01:13	I think I may know why.
9	00:01:19	00:01:21	What kind of animal are we talking about here?
10	00:01:21	00:01:23	A big one.
11	00:01:24	00:01:27	The victim could have clipped the animal when it ran in front of her.
12	00:01:29	00:01:31	Well, it can't have gone far.
13	00:02:50	00:02:53	Hmm. Ooh. Not much padding.
14	00:02:53	00:02:54	Whoa.
15	00:02:54	00:02:56	This is incredibly detailed.
16	00:02:56	00:02:59	Eyelashes, nostrils...
17	00:02:59	00:03:01	Oh, yeah.
18	00:03:01	00:03:02	That's what you see out of.
19	00:03:02	00:03:06	I once dated the Detroit Lions mascot. Off-season.
20	00:03:06	00:03:09	Dutch was his name.
21	00:03:09	00:03:12	The breadth of your social experience never ceases to impress me.
22	00:03:16	00:03:19	Dutch never had furballs, though.
23	00:03:29	00:03:31	Are you all right, David?
24	00:03:31	00:03:34	It's just... disturbing.
25	00:03:34	00:03:39	There was a big raccoon who hosted an after-school kids show when I was little.
26	00:03:39	00:03:41	Stripey.
27	00:03:41	00:03:42	Everybody loved him.
28	00:03:42	00:03:45	I loved him.
29	00:03:45	00:03:51	Stripey's brother suffered blunt force trauma caused by a violent collision with a moving vehicle.
30	00:04:02	00:04:08	The eternal question-- why did the man in the raccoon suit cross the road?
31	00:04:18	00:04:20	Frozen stiff.
32	00:04:20	00:04:24	Looks like he died trying to get out.
33	00:04:24	00:04:27	Trying to get to the door, maybe.
34	00:04:27	00:04:30	It got messy.
35	00:04:30	00:04:32	Check out the shotgun spatter.
36	00:04:32	00:04:34	Single blast.
37	00:04:34	00:04:36	Went in, went out.
38	00:04:36	00:04:40	Ooh. This has got to be the coldest place in Vegas.
39	00:04:40	00:04:42	Let's go. Vega's got the security guard.
40	00:04:42	00:04:44	Yeah, he's not going anywhere.
41	00:04:51	00:04:53	So, Peter, when you checked in...
42	00:04:53	00:04:54	Not Peter.
43	00:04:54	00:04:56	Petey. P-E-T-E-Y.
44	00:04:56	00:04:57	Hey, how you doing? Good.
45	00:04:57	00:05:00	The shooter may have cleaned out the machines.
46	00:05:00	00:05:01	Those things hold a lot of dough.
47	00:05:01	00:05:02	Take was maybe, uh, $600.
48	00:05:02	00:05:04	They shot a guy over a vending machine?
49	00:05:04	00:05:08	So, uh, Petey, where were you when all this went down?
50	00:05:08	00:05:09	I was in the guard shack.
51	00:05:09	00:05:10	Where else would I be?
52	00:05:10	00:05:11	You tell us.
53	00:05:11	00:05:16	If a guy walks into a freezer, shoots a guy and smashes six vending machines, I think I'd hear that.
54	00:05:16	00:05:18	The shack's out there.
55	00:05:18	00:05:20	You don't make rounds?
56	00:05:20	00:05:22	Look, I'm not supposed to leave the premises, okay?
57	00:05:22	00:05:25	Okay, but if you were here, you're a suspect.
58	00:05:25	00:05:28	Come on, man.
59	00:05:28	00:05:30	Middle of the shift, you're getting hungry.
60	00:05:30	00:05:33	You figure, Hey, I'll duck out, grab a bite to eat.
61	00:05:33	00:05:34	Who's going to know, right?
62	00:05:35	00:05:36	I was gone five minutes, tops.
63	00:05:36	00:05:38	When?
64	00:05:38	00:05:39	00.
65	00:05:39	00:05:40	Grabbed a burger and came back.
66	00:05:40	00:05:41	What kind of burger?
67	00:05:41	00:05:42	In 'N' Out-- three blocks from here.
68	00:05:42	00:05:45	I always get the In 'N' Out Double-Double, Animal Style.
69	00:05:45	00:05:46	That's what I get.
70	00:05:46	00:05:47	You grill the onions?
71	00:05:47	00:05:48	Hell, yeah.
72	00:05:48	00:05:54	Now, that is crazy, Petey, 'cause you know, being an In 'N' Out kind of guy, I know it takes at least five minutes to grill the onions alone.
73	00:05:54	00:05:56	Come on, man.
74	00:05:56	00:06:01	That time of night, you're lucky if you don't wait 20 minutes just to get to the window.
75	00:06:04	00:06:08	Look, my boss finds out I'm leaving the site every night to get my burger on, I'm toast.
76	00:06:08	00:06:11	You keep lying to us, you're going to be toast in a jumpsuit.
77	00:06:13	00:06:19	00, this cat George-- he usually works days-- drives up and asks me where Al is.
78	00:06:19	00:06:21	Al Sesto? The guy in the freezer?
79	00:06:21	00:06:23	I told him he was back here.
80	00:06:23	00:06:24	I came back. Everything was quiet.
81	00:06:24	00:06:26	So I ate my dinner in my shack.
82	00:06:26	00:06:27	Where'd George go?
83	00:06:27	00:06:30	Beats me. His car's still in the parking lot.
84	00:06:30	00:06:31	Want to show me which one?
85	00:06:31	00:06:34	Sure.
86	00:06:34	00:06:41	Unless he was slick, the guy that did this definitely left behind a print, and, frankly, nothing about this looks slick.
87	00:06:42	00:06:43	Linda Jones, 35, single.
88	00:06:43	00:06:46	We're trying to track down the next-of-kin.
89	00:06:46	00:06:49	No mystery in cause of death, though.
90	00:06:49	00:06:50	Your basic massive internal trauma.
91	00:06:50	00:06:51	And then some.
92	00:06:52	00:06:54	Anything unusual about our furry friend?
93	00:06:54	00:06:56	We're about to find out.
94	00:07:08	00:07:11	Did you know that raccoons have opposable thumbs?
95	00:07:11	00:07:14	Well, this one liked to wrap his around a bottle.
96	00:07:14	00:07:16	One Day at a Time.
97	00:07:16	00:07:18	He was a friend of Bill W.'s.
98	00:07:19	00:07:22	I'll send the blood work down to Tox.
99	00:07:22	00:07:26	Oh, my-- hand stitching.
100	00:07:26	00:07:28	Lining looks like some kind of latex.
101	00:07:36	00:07:40	Whoa. That's a lot of blood for blunt force trauma.
102	00:07:41	00:07:42	This isn't a costume.
103	00:07:42	00:07:44	It's a six-foot condom.
104	00:07:44	00:07:46	Explains why there was no blood on the road.
105	00:07:48	00:07:51	Yeah, his tailor didn't think of everything.
106	00:07:51	00:07:53	His suit's not bulletproof.
107	00:07:54	00:07:55	Shall we?
108	00:08:04	00:08:05	Through and through.
109	00:08:05	00:08:07	It's a high-velocity round.
110	00:08:07	00:08:09	Gives the bullet a smooth entry in and out.
111	00:08:09	00:08:12	So, he was shot and hit by a car.
112	00:08:12	00:08:13	Bad night.
113	00:08:13	00:08:15	Even for a raccoon.
114	00:08:15	00:08:20	The last time this happened they tried to chop the guy out.
115	00:08:20	00:08:22	1989-- year the Mirage opened.
116	00:08:22	00:08:24	How'd it go?
117	00:08:24	00:08:26	Lost an arm and a leg.
118	00:08:27	00:08:29	I miss the cold weather.
119	00:08:29	00:08:32	So, what are we going to use, hot water?
120	00:08:32	00:08:33	Boiling works best.
121	00:08:33	00:08:36	Just, uh, spread it around the perimeter.
122	00:08:36	00:08:37	Melt the ice.
123	00:08:37	00:08:39	Guys, let's do it here.
124	00:08:41	00:08:42	To preserve the body?
125	00:08:42	00:08:43	That's right.
126	00:08:43	00:08:47	Close as you can.
127	00:09:01	00:09:03	All right, guys, let's go.
128	00:10:18	00:10:20	Hi, Warrick. Hey.
129	00:10:20	00:10:22	Anything on Mr. Raccoon?
130	00:10:22	00:10:23	Yeah.
131	00:10:23	00:10:25	I got an AFIS hit.
132	00:10:25	00:10:27	Robert Pitt.
133	00:10:27	00:10:29	Court-ordered to AA after a DUI.
134	00:10:29	00:10:32	Oh, that explains the 30-day chip.
135	00:10:32	00:10:36	Maybe he fell off the wagon after he hit 31.
136	00:10:36	00:10:40	If I had to walk around dressed like Rocky Raccoon, I'd be drinking, too.
137	00:10:40	00:10:42	I don't get this whole thing.
138	00:10:42	00:10:43	Oh, hey, Warrick, it's Vegas.
139	00:10:43	00:10:45	People come here to be animals.
140	00:10:45	00:10:46	I hear you.
141	00:10:46	00:10:47	Take a look at this.
142	00:10:48	00:10:51	Oh, yes, the blue fur in the vomit.
143	00:10:52	00:10:53	Yeah, it's synthetic, not natural.
144	00:10:53	00:10:56	Your manimal died sober.
145	00:10:56	00:10:58	No alcohol.
146	00:10:58	00:10:59	Really?
147	00:10:59	00:11:07	All this schmohawk had in his system was trace amounts of ipecac and civet oil, which, if you ask me, is even weirder than the raccoon suit he was wearing.
148	00:11:07	00:11:09	Well, ipecac's an emetic.
149	00:11:09	00:11:14	I once gave it to Lindsey when she swallowed mothballs, but civet oil?
150	00:11:14	00:11:15	Yeah. Civet's a wild cat.
151	00:11:15	00:11:20	Its scent has been prized since the pharaohs for being an aphrodisiac.
152	00:11:31	00:11:33	Pitt was a computer programmer.
153	00:11:33	00:11:34	No next-of-kin.
154	00:11:34	00:11:35	Ooh.
155	00:11:35	00:11:38	Not an Architectural Digestreader.
156	00:11:45	00:11:50	If you want to know what the man really is all about, check out his bedroom.
157	00:11:57	00:11:59	Now, this scares me.
158	00:11:59	00:12:00	A man lives alone.
159	00:12:01	00:12:02	Has no relatives.
160	00:12:02	00:12:04	No attachments.
161	00:12:04	00:12:10	So, he forms his own furry little family.
162	00:12:15	00:12:17	PAF Con meeting.
163	00:12:17	00:12:18	What's PAF Con?
164	00:12:18	00:12:23	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's still going on.
165	00:12:23	00:12:26	Minus one raccoon.
166	00:12:34	00:12:36	PAF Con?
167	00:12:37	00:12:39	The Plushies and Furries Convention.
168	00:12:39	00:12:42	And we're looking for a bright blue plushy, I think.
169	00:12:49	00:12:51	This is fascinating.
170	00:12:51	00:12:53	A whole tribe of people...
171	00:12:53	00:12:58	...who prefer to interact as furry animals rather than human beings.
172	00:12:58	00:13:02	I think I'm having Hunter Thompson's flashbacks.
173	00:13:02	00:13:05	This is weirding me out.
174	00:13:05	00:13:06	It's not that weird.
175	00:13:06	00:13:07	It's instinctual.
176	00:13:08	00:13:14	Many Native American tribes wore entire bearskins, including the bead, when they performed their war dances.
177	00:13:14	00:13:16	They thought it made them brave.
178	00:13:16	00:13:18	I'm not getting the brave thing.
179	00:13:18	00:13:22	Well, think of stuffed animals as a Jungian archetype.
180	00:13:22	00:13:25	What's the one quality they possess that a man like Bob Pitt might want?
181	00:13:25	00:13:27	A full head of hair?
182	00:13:27	00:13:30	They're lovable.
183	00:13:30	00:13:33	We better divide and mingle.
184	00:13:34	00:13:38	I'm going to take in a lecture.
185	00:13:40	00:13:41	Uh, why did you page us?
186	00:13:41	00:13:42	Your wood sample from the freezer.
187	00:13:42	00:13:43	The one we gave Hodges?
188	00:13:43	00:13:45	Yeah. He bounced it back to me.
189	00:13:45	00:13:46	I'm lost.
190	00:13:46	00:13:47	It's from a shotgun stock.
191	00:13:47	00:13:48	Probably a Mossberg 500.
192	00:13:48	00:13:50	Probably our murder weapon.
193	00:13:50	00:13:52	Well, if you find it, I can match it.
194	00:13:52	00:13:53	Till we do, anything else?
195	00:13:53	00:13:55	That's up to Hodges.
196	00:13:55	00:13:58	The gray stuff-- it's adhesive.
197	00:13:58	00:13:59	On the gun stock?
198	00:13:59	00:14:01	Cheap repair.
199	00:14:02	00:14:07	So, some budget-minded garage gunsmith glues his gun stock together...
200	00:14:07	00:14:10	And then kills Al Sesto for $600 in change.
201	00:14:10	00:14:12	Even Petey can do better than that.
202	00:14:12	00:14:14	There's always the elusive George.
203	00:14:24	00:14:26	Can I help you, sir?
204	00:14:26	00:14:28	Yeah, I want to report a crime.
205	00:14:31	00:14:35	Let's start with what you were doing at Big &amp; Best Warehouse, George.
206	00:14:35	00:14:36	You're the day guy.
207	00:14:36	00:14:38	It was the night shift there.
208	00:14:38	00:14:40	Expired ice cream.
209	00:14:40	00:14:41	Trash for cash.
210	00:14:41	00:14:43	You're selling expired ice cream?
211	00:14:43	00:14:44	It's still good.
212	00:14:44	00:14:45	Oh.
213	00:14:45	00:14:47	Go on, please.
214	00:14:47	00:14:51	I wanted to give Al his piece of the action, 88 bucks.
215	00:14:51	00:14:55	We, uh, walked into the break room, and someone was smashing up the candy machine.
216	00:14:58	00:14:59	Ski mask?
217	00:14:59	00:15:00	Yeah.
218	00:15:00	00:15:02	And he had a gun.
219	00:15:04	00:15:04	Better chill, bro. Okay.
220	00:15:05	00:15:06	Get back. Don't shoot!
221	00:15:06	00:15:07	Shut up! Don't shoot.
222	00:15:09	00:15:11	He shot Al.
223	00:15:11	00:15:14	Then the guy hauls off and brains me.
224	00:15:14	00:15:17	And after that, everything went black.
225	00:15:17	00:15:19	Everything went black?
226	00:15:19	00:15:22	That's a pretty nasty bruise.
227	00:15:22	00:15:23	Yeah, I told you.
228	00:15:23	00:15:25	So, you blacked out.
229	00:15:25	00:15:26	Then what happened?
230	00:15:26	00:15:33	I was blindfolded, shoved into the trunk of some car and, uh, drove around for almost an hour.
231	00:15:33	00:15:35	It, uh, glows in the dark.
232	00:15:35	00:15:36	Oh, yeah.
233	00:15:37	00:15:41	So, uh, now, how did you get out?
234	00:15:41	00:15:42	Tire iron.
235	00:15:42	00:15:45	I felt around in the dark, and, uh, there it was.
236	00:15:45	00:15:46	Where?
237	00:15:46	00:15:48	Under the, uh, the trunk liner.
238	00:15:48	00:15:50	I had to really twist to get at it.
239	00:15:50	00:15:51	Which hand did you use?
240	00:15:51	00:15:53	Right.
241	00:15:53	00:15:55	And then what?
242	00:15:55	00:15:56	I popped the trunk.
243	00:16:02	00:16:04	I-I was in Pahrump.
244	00:16:04	00:16:07	I got family out there, but nobody was home.
245	00:16:07	00:16:09	All right, MacGyver, could you do me a favor?
246	00:16:09	00:16:11	Could you stand up and hold your arms out?
247	00:16:11	00:16:13	I'm just going to check you out here.
248	00:16:24	00:16:25	I'm ticklish.
249	00:16:25	00:16:27	Oh.
250	00:16:35	00:16:38	George...
251	00:16:38	00:16:43	I'm afraid you and your pants are going to be here for a while.
252	00:16:44	00:17:13	In The Eight Ages of Man, Erikson states that the child often indulges in fantasies of being a tiger, but in his dream, runs in terror for dear life, thus leaving the child forever divided in himself, as his true potential is squashed by the observing superego of society.
253	00:17:14	00:17:17	Birth is-is not destiny.
254	00:17:17	00:17:22	And a human form doesn't always come with a human spirit.
255	00:17:22	00:17:29	We gather here to embrace our inner animal, and to bring our true nature to bear.
256	00:17:29	00:17:31	So to speak.
257	00:17:32	00:17:34	Five-minute break.
258	00:17:36	00:17:41	Excuse me. Do you recognize this man, Robert Pitt?
259	00:17:43	00:17:45	Oh.
260	00:17:45	00:17:46	Hello, guys.
261	00:17:46	00:17:47	Pardon me.
262	00:17:47	00:17:49	Uh, can you help me out here?
263	00:17:49	00:17:52	Do you recognize this guy?
264	00:17:52	00:17:54	Look-look again.
265	00:17:54	00:17:55	Uh-uh.
266	00:17:55	00:17:56	Hmm.
267	00:17:56	00:17:58	Nice dog.
268	00:18:21	00:18:23	There you go.
269	00:18:53	00:18:55	I'm Catherine Willows.
270	00:18:55	00:18:57	I'm with the Crime Lab.
271	00:19:10	00:19:14	I guess we're lucky that blue's not a more popular color. Wait.
272	00:19:14	00:19:16	This is racial profiling.
273	00:19:16	00:19:22	Um, we're going to need samples of your fur.
274	00:19:22	00:19:25	We're also going to need to talk to you without the masks on.
275	00:19:28	00:19:30	Uh-uh.
276	00:19:30	00:19:32	You have a problem with that?
277	00:19:32	00:19:35	You wouldn't ask a human lady to take her makeup off.
278	00:19:35	00:19:40	If you want to talk to me, this is the me you're going to talk to.
279	00:20:03	00:20:05	Take this chair right here.
280	00:20:08	00:20:11	Do you a have a name, Miss, uh...?
281	00:20:11	00:20:12	My friends call me Sexy.
282	00:20:12	00:20:14	Oh, lucky you.
283	00:20:14	00:20:16	Now, do you want some help with the... your helmet?
284	00:20:16	00:20:17	I'm a lawyer.
285	00:20:17	00:20:19	I know my rights.
286	00:20:19	00:20:23	You can't sequester a domestic animal without due cause.
287	00:20:23	00:20:24	Well, it's coming off one way or the other, so...
288	00:20:25	00:20:26	Fine, fine.
289	00:20:34	00:20:37	Hello, Sexy.
290	00:20:37	00:20:39	Okay. Happy now?
291	00:20:40	00:20:41	Thrilled.
292	00:20:41	00:20:42	Let's start at the top.
293	00:20:42	00:20:45	What's your human name, sir?
294	00:20:45	00:20:47	Bud. Bud Simmons.
295	00:20:47	00:20:50	But I'm no criminal, and I don't have to talk to you people.
296	00:20:51	00:20:53	You have a very musky odor, Bud.
297	00:20:53	00:20:57	Quite stimulating, I imagine.
298	00:21:00	00:21:07	Look, we found blue fibers similar to the ones on your costume in the stomach of a dead man.
299	00:21:07	00:21:09	Bob Pitt.
300	00:21:09	00:21:10	Huh?
301	00:21:10	00:21:13	You may know him as Rocky Raccoon?
302	00:21:13	00:21:17	You think my costume killed Rocky?
303	00:21:17	00:21:20	We think it may have incapacitated him.
304	00:21:20	00:21:22	Rocky was...
305	00:21:22	00:21:24	skritching me.
306	00:21:24	00:21:25	That's one I haven't heard.
307	00:21:26	00:21:28	Skritching is like grooming.
308	00:21:28	00:21:31	It's friendly scratching.
309	00:21:31	00:21:40	People who don't know each other can't just nuzzle and trade tummy-rubs, but for animals, skritching is perfectly normal.
310	00:21:40	00:21:43	Well, killing is perfectly normal for them, too.
311	00:21:43	00:21:45	It doesn't make it legal for you.
312	00:21:52	00:21:58	Well, clearly, this kitty costume is where Bud felt safe enough to skritch.
313	00:21:58	00:22:03	I wonder if he also felt safe enough to explore some of the more...
314	00:22:03	00:22:06	aggressive aspects of his animus.
315	00:22:06	00:22:12	So, if we follow the ipecac and civet oil, maybe it'll lead us to the shooter.
316	00:22:14	00:22:16	I don't see a compartment for a concealed rifle.
317	00:22:46	00:22:55	Okay, well... I've heard of some guys getting off in some weird ways, but humping an animal suit?
318	00:22:55	00:22:57	Well, whatever happened to normal sex?
319	00:22:57	00:22:59	What is normal sex?
320	00:22:59	00:23:06	Uh, you think it's natural for a grown human to only be intimate with a talking animal?
321	00:23:06	00:23:09	Well, Freud said that the only unnatural sexual behavior was to have none at all.
322	00:23:09	00:23:13	And after that, it's just a question of opportunity and preference.
323	00:23:13	00:23:18	And evidently, many prefer the feel of fur to the texture of human skin.
324	00:23:18	00:23:23	Well, I like hairy chests, but I'm not about to bop a six-foot weasel.
325	00:23:24	00:23:29	Bud is starting to look like a pretty bad cat.
326	00:23:29	00:23:32	Trace from his costume.
327	00:23:32	00:23:36	Well, identical to the trace we found in Rocky Raccoon's vomit.
328	00:23:36	00:23:39	Ipecac and civet oil.
329	00:23:39	00:23:41	Well, that's what you get for eating...
330	00:23:48	00:23:53	What kind of a knucklehead rolls into PD wearing pants with blood on them?
331	00:23:53	00:23:56	The kind that knows eventually, the cops are going to want to talk to him.
332	00:23:56	00:23:57	Yeah.
333	00:23:58	00:23:59	Preemptive strike, huh?
334	00:23:59	00:24:03	There's only one drop here, and it originated on the inside of the cuff.
335	00:24:03	00:24:06	I don't think George knew he had blood on him.
336	00:24:07	00:24:09	We need to get this to Greg.
337	00:24:09	00:24:10	I was in that freezer.
338	00:24:10	00:24:12	Man, there was spatter everywhere.
339	00:24:13	00:24:19	Now, assuming that is Al's blood, how does George not get it on the outside of his pants?
340	00:24:21	00:24:23	Do you think George is telling the truth?
341	00:24:26	00:24:29	Room temperature 72 degrees.
342	00:24:29	00:24:31	Okay...
343	00:24:32	00:24:34	...fire in the hole.
344	00:24:43	00:24:46	That's what blood spatter looks like at room temperature.
345	00:24:46	00:24:48	Now for the good stuff.
346	00:24:48	00:24:51	Changing one variable.
347	00:24:51	00:24:55	Dropping temperature to 22 degrees.
348	00:25:07	00:25:11	That explains how only one drop of blood got on the inside of George's pants.
349	00:25:18	00:25:21	When he left the freezer, the drop melted.
350	00:25:21	00:25:23	Shooter was standing in front of Al.
351	00:25:23	00:25:25	A spatter went back and to the sides.
352	00:25:25	00:25:28	George is not the shooter.
353	00:25:28	00:25:32	So, who is the masked man?
354	00:25:32	00:25:34	Well, Lone Ranger had Tonto.
355	00:25:34	00:25:35	Some doofus has George.
356	00:25:36	00:25:40	Tape lifts from your suspect's clothing, loaded with paint chips.
357	00:25:40	00:25:41	What kind?
358	00:25:41	00:25:42	Dual layers.
359	00:25:42	00:25:44	The bottom one's burgundy vehicle paint.
360	00:25:44	00:25:47	Factory pigment used on 1984 Monte Carlo.
361	00:25:47	00:25:48	What's the top layer?
362	00:25:48	00:25:53	In an unprecedented move, whoever it was painted over the burgundy with...
363	00:25:54	00:25:55	Want to venture a guess?
364	00:25:57	00:25:59	Bright blue house paint.
365	00:25:59	00:26:01	Doofus.
366	00:26:01	00:26:02	Why would somebody use house paint on a car?
367	00:26:02	00:26:06	Maybe he remodeled the breakfast nook and had some left over. Who knows?
368	00:26:06	00:26:08	I don't try to figure out what people do anymore.
369	00:26:08	00:26:09	That's smart.
370	00:26:09	00:26:11	Yeah, I know.
371	00:26:11	00:26:13	Oil and water.
372	00:26:13	00:26:15	Love to be there when his hood starts to peel.
373	00:26:15	00:26:17	Okay, first things first.
374	00:26:17	00:26:19	Let's go find the car.
375	00:26:19	00:26:22	Okay, Bud, I'm going to get right to it.
376	00:26:22	00:26:25	Bob Pitt's semen was found all over your kitty costume.
377	00:26:25	00:26:26	You lied to us.
378	00:26:26	00:26:29	You were doing a little more than grooming.
379	00:26:31	00:26:36	It started as a skritch, then everyone got in a furpile and pretty soon, we were all yiffing.
380	00:26:42	00:26:44	I get furpile.
381	00:26:44	00:26:47	Define yiffing.
382	00:26:47	00:26:56	In a furpile, when all the animals start rubbing and wiggling, some of them start to do things.
383	00:27:10	00:27:14	The kind of things that leave semen on your fur?
384	00:27:14	00:27:15	That never happened before.
385	00:27:17	00:27:18	Okay.
386	00:27:18	00:27:20	That happened before.
387	00:27:20	00:27:21	I know what you're thinking.
388	00:27:21	00:27:22	You couldn't possibly.
389	00:27:22	00:27:24	I didn't kill Rocky Raccoon.
390	00:27:24	00:27:26	Did you smear ipecac and civet oil on the back of your costume?
391	00:27:26	00:27:28	That's crazy.
392	00:27:28	00:27:29	I was there for the yiffing, and that's all.
393	00:27:29	00:27:35	Look, if I don't have my costume on, I pretty much can't get yiffed.
394	00:27:35	00:27:37	Okay, Bud.
395	00:27:37	00:27:41	We're going to leave you some time to think about it.
396	00:27:41	00:27:44	Enjoy your new costume.
397	00:27:51	00:27:53	Are you buying this guy?
398	00:27:53	00:27:56	Oh, who the hell knows what goes on in a furpile?
399	00:27:56	00:28:01	But if somebody doused their special scent on Kitty's back, I'm sure he's going to want to know who did it.
400	00:28:01	00:28:04	Well, he gives us all the furnames of people in the pile.
401	00:28:04	00:28:06	What are we going to do-- put out an APB on Tom and Jerry?
402	00:28:06	00:28:12	Maybe we just ask him where the hip, young plushy-on-the-go likes to hang out?
403	00:28:37	00:28:38	Password, please?
404	00:28:38	00:28:41	E-I-E-I-O?
405	00:28:41	00:28:43	This is a private party.
406	00:28:43	00:28:47	Uh, we have an invitation from the Las Vegas Police Department.
407	00:28:47	00:28:49	Uh, okay.
408	00:29:04	00:29:06	Whoa, Nellie!
409	00:29:08	00:29:10	Is this a raid?
410	00:29:10	00:29:12	It's a homicide investigation.
411	00:29:12	00:29:20	Look, we need you to stop skritching or yiffing or whatever, take off your costumes, and tell us your names.
412	00:29:30	00:29:31	Ooh!
413	00:29:31	00:29:33	These costumes are pretty marinated.
414	00:29:33	00:29:36	Smokey could've used some deodorant.
415	00:29:36	00:29:40	Well, you know, pheromones are the basis for mammalian reproduction.
416	00:29:40	00:29:44	When the female is in estrus, the male picks up on her come-get-me scent.
417	00:29:46	00:29:50	But most mammals only copulate seasonally.
418	00:29:50	00:29:52	How boring.
419	00:29:52	00:29:54	For some.
420	00:29:57	00:30:00	No one else in that furpile threw up, right?
421	00:30:01	00:30:05	Uh, Rocky was a target.
422	00:30:14	00:30:17	Smell this.
423	00:30:23	00:30:25	Civet oil and ipecac.
424	00:30:27	00:30:30	So I guess we're looking for a wolf...
425	00:30:30	00:30:32	in wolf's clothing.
426	00:30:33	00:30:43	Mr. Lee, the concentration of ipecac and civet oil on your paws speaks to application, rather than accidental transfer.
427	00:30:43	00:30:44	Okay. Fine.
428	00:30:44	00:30:55	I... I mixed up some ipecac and some civet oil and I-I... I rubbed it on Sexy... Sexy Kitty.
429	00:31:00	00:31:02	Why Sexy Kitty?
430	00:31:02	00:31:04	'Cause Rocky couldn't get enough of her.
431	00:31:04	00:31:06	What did Rocky do to you?
432	00:31:06	00:31:08	He's a raccoon.
433	00:31:08	00:31:10	They're all lowlifes.
434	00:31:10	00:31:14	I mean, honestly, what do they do?
435	00:31:14	00:31:16	Screw...
436	00:31:16	00:31:18	eat garbage...
437	00:31:18	00:31:20	screw some more.
438	00:31:20	00:31:25	Is this a, uh, general observation, or possibly a personal grievance?
439	00:31:27	00:31:32	At last year's convention, Rocky stole my girlfriend.
440	00:31:32	00:31:38	And in the wild, wolves are monogamous, but raccoons are promiscuous.
441	00:31:38	00:31:40	That's right.
442	00:31:42	00:31:52	And I just, I knew, I knew since Sexy Kitty was Rocky's fave, he'd have his filthy raccoon mouth all over her again this year.
443	00:31:52	00:31:58	All I wanted to do was make him sick enough so that he'd have to go home and stop cheating on my mate.
444	00:31:58	00:32:00	Your ex-mate?
445	00:32:01	00:32:02	Yes.
446	00:32:02	00:32:08	I couldn't take seeing what that wanna-be marsupial put her through.
447	00:32:08	00:32:11	My Linda Lamb deserved better.
448	00:32:11	00:32:13	Mr. Lee, you're a wolf.
449	00:32:13	00:32:15	How'd you end up with a lamb?
450	00:32:15	00:32:19	I used to work with Linda.
451	00:32:19	00:32:23	And one day, I found out about what she did on the weekends.
452	00:32:25	00:32:28	And she helped me...
453	00:32:29	00:32:31	become who I am.
454	00:32:31	00:32:34	I always knew that I was a...
455	00:32:34	00:32:36	something else.
456	00:32:36	00:32:42	And... Linda made it real.
457	00:32:45	00:32:48	She was one of a kind.
458	00:32:48	00:32:52	Does, uh, Linda Lamb have a human last name?
459	00:32:53	00:32:56	Jones.
460	00:32:56	00:32:57	Why?
461	00:33:06	00:33:09	Linda Jones is Linda Lamb.
462	00:33:09	00:33:10	Damn it.
463	00:33:11	00:33:12	This was here the whole time.
464	00:33:12	00:33:14	Yeah, but evidence without context is not evidence.
465	00:33:14	00:33:17	We had no reason to search the trunk.
466	00:33:17	00:33:20	So she didn't just hit Rocky, she knew him.
467	00:33:20	00:33:24	For the philandering raccoon that he was.
468	00:33:28	00:33:38	Okay, assuming that Linda and Bob were heading home after Bob got sick at the hotel, how did he end up on the side of the road?
469	00:33:38	00:33:41	You ever have a car-fight?
470	00:33:42	00:33:46	Well, if a couple has any kind of history together, they know how to press each other's buttons.
471	00:33:47	00:33:52	And you lock 'em up in a metal box with wheels on a bad night, they're going to start pressing 'em.
472	00:33:52	00:33:54	You follow?
473	00:33:54	00:34:00	So, uh, either Bob told Linda to stop the car and let him out, or she told him to start walking?
474	00:34:00	00:34:01	Yes. That one.
475	00:34:03	00:34:11	I mean, it's bad enough that raccoon-boy blows his girlfriend off to go fur-piling-- he gets sick licking some nasty kitty and makes Lambchop drive him home.
476	00:34:15	00:34:18	why did she turn the car around and head back toward the hotel?
477	00:34:18	00:34:21	Well, she wasn't heading back to the hotel.
478	00:34:21	00:34:22	She was heading back for him.
479	00:34:22	00:34:25	'Cause that's how car-fights always end.
480	00:34:25	00:34:30	After about a mile or two, you start to feel guilty that you've abandoned the person, and you turn around.
481	00:34:31	00:34:33	Except she didn't plan on an 18-wheeler finishing her off.
482	00:34:33	00:34:36	Mack truck ex machina.
483	00:34:37	00:34:41	But it still doesn't explain how Bob got shot in the back.
484	00:34:41	00:34:43	No...
485	00:34:43	00:34:47	but I think I may know the last person who saw them alive.
486	00:34:47	00:34:53	Why don't we ask the valet if he remembers a couple of... furriest conventioneers?
487	00:34:56	00:35:00	Hey, Sara, no luck on the car, but Hodges ran the gunstock adhesive.
488	00:35:00	00:35:06	It's primarily an epoxy polyester resin with traces of styrene and benzyl peroxide and ground terra-cotta.
489	00:35:06	00:35:08	Is that supposed to mean something to me?
490	00:35:08	00:35:09	Terra-cotta's the giveaway.
491	00:35:09	00:35:10	It's a granite glue.
492	00:35:10	00:35:11	Granite glue?
493	00:35:11	00:35:14	Yeah. It's used for adhering joints on big pieces of stone.
494	00:35:14	00:35:17	House paint on his car; granite glue on his gun...
495	00:35:17	00:35:18	Well, he used what was available.
496	00:35:18	00:35:19	That's what people do.
497	00:35:19	00:35:21	Well, I understand the house paint, but where do you get granite glue?
498	00:35:21	00:35:22	I already checked.
499	00:35:23	00:35:26	There's not too many places in Clark County that specialize in granite installation, so...
500	00:35:26	00:35:33	Okay, I will bet you a double-double animal style that one of them employs a guy with a blue 1984 Monte Carlo.
501	00:35:33	00:35:34	That's a bet.
502	00:35:34	00:35:35	Excellent.
503	00:35:40	00:35:42	Damn straight I remember them.
504	00:35:42	00:35:47	How often do you see a six-foot raccoon heaving out a car window?
505	00:35:47	00:35:48	Dude was hammered, man.
506	00:35:48	00:35:51	His girl... she was pissed.
507	00:35:51	00:35:52	Thank you.
508	00:35:52	00:35:53	You've been very helpful.
509	00:35:53	00:35:54	All right, no problem.
510	00:35:55	00:35:56	Hey, I got that.
511	00:35:56	00:35:58	So, there's your car-fight.
512	00:35:58	00:36:05	Now she thinks that he's back on the booze, which he denies, but the sicker he gets, the more she thinks he's lying.
513	00:36:05	00:36:08	I can't believe you're drinking again.
514	00:36:08	00:36:09	You promised.
515	00:36:09	00:36:10	I was not drinking.
516	00:36:13	00:36:14	Must be food poisoning.
517	00:36:14	00:36:16	Oh?
518	00:36:16	00:36:18	Didn't know they served food in a furpile.
519	00:36:18	00:36:21	The Righteously Angry versus the Wrongly Accused.
520	00:36:21	00:36:23	And the battle's just beginning.
521	00:36:24	00:36:26	Would you just take off the mask and talk to me?!
522	00:36:26	00:36:28	No, just pull over and let me out of the car!
523	00:36:28	00:36:29	You want out? Ah...
524	00:36:30	00:36:31	Get out! Just get out!
525	00:36:32	00:36:36	Okay, so it makes sense up to that point, but then what?
526	00:36:36	00:36:38	He gets out and...
527	00:36:39	00:36:41	...she shoots him?
528	00:36:41	00:36:46	I'm not so sure that people who dress up like cuddly forest creatures carry guns.
529	00:36:46	00:36:48	You don't think they allow plushies in the NRA?
530	00:36:50	00:36:52	All right, then who shot him?
531	00:36:52	00:36:53	Well, we have a grassy knoll...
532	00:36:53	00:36:56	but no Lee Harvey Oswald.
533	00:36:57	00:37:02	You're a triple threat-- robbery, kidnapping, murder.
534	00:37:02	00:37:07	Big &amp; Best Foods, Al Sesto, George Bartell.
535	00:37:07	00:37:09	Any of this resonate?
536	00:37:09	00:37:11	I don't know no Al Sesto.
537	00:37:13	00:37:15	Virgil, is that your shotgun?
538	00:37:15	00:37:16	We found it in your garage.
539	00:37:16	00:37:20	If, uh, you look, you'll see a chip in the stock.
540	00:37:20	00:37:23	We found that in the freezer at the Big &amp; Best Foods.
541	00:37:25	00:37:27	Is this your car?
542	00:37:27	00:37:29	It was also in your garage.
543	00:37:29	00:37:34	It has dual-layered paint, identical to the dual-layered paint chips we found on your kidnap victim.
544	00:37:35	00:37:37	Anything to say, tough guy?
545	00:37:37	00:37:38	Yeah.
546	00:37:38	00:37:40	I want a lawyer.
547	00:38:12	00:38:13	Hey, Grissom.
548	00:38:13	00:38:16	Over here. I found the bullet.
549	00:38:24	00:38:26	Well done.
550	00:38:26	00:38:35	So, we got a sick raccoon with an abdominal through-and-through who was shot from what appears to be a fairly steep trajectory.
551	00:38:35	00:38:43	So, either he was shot by a giant... or he was, uh, on all fours.
552	00:38:45	00:38:48	Or both.
553	00:38:48	00:38:56	I mean, imagine what it must have looked like out here at night and from a distance.
554	00:38:59	00:39:01	We've been looking for...
555	00:39:01	00:39:05	a person who shot a person, but...
556	00:39:07	00:39:10	...maybe we should be looking for a person who shot an animal.
557	00:39:18	00:39:20	Hey, Virgil.
558	00:39:21	00:39:23	What are you doing here?
559	00:39:23	00:39:24	What am I doing here?
560	00:39:24	00:39:26	Yeah. Why, you guys know each other?
561	00:39:26	00:39:28	Yeah, that's my cousin.
562	00:39:28	00:39:29	Pahrump?
563	00:39:31	00:39:33	My own blood, and you set me up.
564	00:39:33	00:39:35	After I saved your ass.
565	00:39:35	00:39:37	I should have shot you in that freezer.
566	00:39:37	00:39:38	You son of a bitch!
567	00:39:38	00:39:39	Hey, hey!
568	00:39:39	00:39:40	You looking for more time?
569	00:39:40	00:39:41	Now come on.
570	00:39:43	00:39:45	Oh, man.
571	00:39:48	00:39:49	I'm so stupid.
572	00:39:49	00:39:50	Ah, you're not stupid.
573	00:39:50	00:39:53	Man, your cousin just set you up.
574	00:39:53	00:39:54	Bowling night.
575	00:39:54	00:39:56	Is that where you told him about the vending machines?
576	00:39:56	00:40:00	And Petey's burger runs?
577	00:40:00	00:40:02	My own cousin.
578	00:40:02	00:40:09	Well... George, sometimes people, they, uh, disappoint us.
579	00:40:09	00:40:11	Why?
580	00:40:24	00:40:25	How you doing?
581	00:40:25	00:40:26	Can I help you?
582	00:40:26	00:40:28	We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
583	00:40:28	00:40:30	This your place? Yeah.
584	00:40:30	00:40:31	Must be here about that accident.
585	00:40:31	00:40:32	Terrible thing.
586	00:40:32	00:40:37	Like I said to the wife, the way these 18-wheelers fly down here ballin' the jack, I ain't surprised.
587	00:40:37	00:40:39	I'm surprised there ain't more accidents.
588	00:40:39	00:40:43	Why don't you give us a brief history of your evening?
589	00:40:43	00:40:46	Ah, well, I had dinner with the missus.
590	00:40:46	00:40:48	Uh, fed the scraps to the dogs.
591	00:40:48	00:40:50	Uh, watched Jeopardy.
592	00:40:51	00:40:55	Could hardly hear it, the dogs were, uh, so stirred up.
593	00:40:55	00:40:58	Went outside to take a look, spotted a coyote.
594	00:40:58	00:40:59	This is my business.
595	00:40:59	00:41:01	Purebreds. Wouldn't want to lose one.
596	00:41:01	00:41:04	So, I, uh, took care of it.
597	00:41:04	00:41:07	Came back inside in time for Final Jeopardy.
598	00:41:10	00:41:13	So the raccoon was mistaken for a coyote.
599	00:41:13	00:41:15	You gotta be kidding me.
600	00:41:15	00:41:20	He was dosed intentionally, but killed accidentally.
601	00:41:20	00:41:24	We got the ranger's rifle, we collected a bullet at the scene, and ballistics made a match.
602	00:41:24	00:41:31	Bob Pitt was sick when he got out of the car, wounded when he got onto the road, and dead when he hit the dirt.
603	00:41:31	00:41:34	Get out! Just get out!
604	00:41:56	00:42:03	Well, the rancher's going to get off, Linda's dead, and Wolfie...
605	00:42:03	00:42:05	skates with a misdemeanor.
606	00:42:05	00:42:12	We took one look at those furry suits and thought foul play, but this was really just a domestic dispute gone mad.
607	00:42:12	00:42:15	Hmm. Fur and loathing in Las Vegas.
