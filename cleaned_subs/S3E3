0	00:00:14	00:00:17	Wow, I love it already.
1	00:00:18	00:00:22	I can't believe we're doing this. Is that the lockbox?
2	00:00:22	00:00:24	Broker gave me the combination.
3	00:00:24	00:00:26	He's doing a walk-through in Seven Hills.
4	00:00:27	00:00:30	Owners are out.
5	00:00:41	00:00:44	Wow.
6	00:00:44	00:00:46	Wait till you see the master.
7	00:00:54	00:00:56	Oh, my God.
8	00:00:56	00:00:58	This is gorgeous.
9	00:00:59	00:01:01	Amazing.
10	00:01:04	00:01:06	What?
11	00:01:06	00:01:08	Want to snoop around?
12	00:01:20	00:01:21	Hey.
13	00:01:23	00:01:25	What do you think?
14	00:01:25	00:01:26	I don't know, yeah. It's nice?
15	00:01:26	00:01:28	Looks good.
16	00:01:28	00:01:29	Cut it out.
17	00:01:29	00:01:31	No, seriously, I think I hear a car.
18	00:01:31	00:01:32	Will you relax? No, really.
19	00:01:32	00:01:34	You're paranoid.
20	00:01:39	00:01:41	Oh, my God.
21	00:01:41	00:01:42	I could get used to this place.
22	00:01:42	00:01:43	I bet you could.
23	00:01:43	00:01:44	I could.
24	00:01:45	00:01:46	You're an animal.
25	00:01:46	00:01:48	The backyard is the best part of the house.
26	00:01:48	00:01:49	Really? Is there a Jacuzzi?
27	00:01:54	00:01:57	Oh, my God.
28	00:01:57	00:02:00	Looks like something out of a magazine.
29	00:02:26	00:02:28	Cal and Monica Newman.
30	00:02:28	00:02:31	Owners of the house. My guess, second marriage.
31	00:02:31	00:02:32	'Cause she's a babe and he's...
32	00:02:32	00:02:34	He's, uh...
33	00:02:34	00:02:35	got a good sense of humor.
34	00:02:44	00:02:49	.380 auto caliber.
35	00:02:54	00:02:56	Gunshot, right temple.
36	00:02:56	00:02:59	Women don't usually shoot themselves in the head do they, Catherine?
37	00:02:59	00:03:03	Well, gunshots do a number on your face so typically women prefer pills.
38	00:03:04	00:03:06	So what are we calling this, murder, suicide, what?
39	00:03:06	00:03:09	Is the husband around?
40	00:03:09	00:03:10	No.
41	00:03:12	00:03:15	Dead female spouse plus missing husband...
42	00:03:15	00:03:17	equals murder.
43	00:03:53	00:03:54	Okay, Warrick, hit it.
44	00:04:00	00:04:03	White female, multiple bruising...
45	00:04:03	00:04:06	Bullet hole to the temple doesn't help.
46	00:04:06	00:04:09	.380 auto on the side.
47	00:04:09	00:04:13	Yeah, somebody manhandled her pretty good before they killed her.
48	00:04:33	00:04:35	Reminds me of my daughter.
49	00:04:35	00:04:37	She used throw butts out the window, too.
50	00:04:37	00:04:40	The Newmans have kids?
51	00:04:40	00:04:43	A kid. Son, 15, Max Newman.
52	00:04:43	00:04:45	He's MIA like the father.
53	00:04:45	00:04:49	The secretary said he went out for lunch and never came back.
54	00:04:49	00:04:51	I checked the garage-- three cars.
55	00:04:51	00:04:54	None of the hoods are hot.
56	00:04:54	00:04:56	We're missing something.
57	00:04:56	00:04:58	Grissom. Mr. Grissom.
58	00:04:58	00:05:01	Where would I find Mr. Grissom?
59	00:05:02	00:05:03	Great, great. Thank you very much. Mr. Grissom?
60	00:05:03	00:05:06	Hi, I'm Augie Heitz.
61	00:05:06	00:05:07	This is my listing.
62	00:05:08	00:05:09	Someone died, I know.
63	00:05:09	00:05:11	It's a terrible thing.
64	00:05:11	00:05:14	But we got people knocking down awnings stomping through the flower beds.
65	00:05:14	00:05:17	How am I supposed to sell this house?
66	00:05:17	00:05:18	You're not.
67	00:05:18	00:05:20	It's a crime scene.
68	00:05:20	00:05:23	Mr. Heitz, you're Mr. Newman's broker.
69	00:05:23	00:05:25	Have you seen your client lately?
70	00:05:25	00:05:27	What, you kidding?
71	00:05:27	00:05:30	I mean, this is actually the beauty of the service I provide.
72	00:05:30	00:05:32	My clients never have to see me.
73	00:05:32	00:05:35	They don't even have to be home when I show their house.
74	00:05:35	00:05:36	Do you always give out the combination to your lockboxes?
75	00:05:37	00:05:38	It's illegal.
76	00:05:38	00:05:40	It's a hot market.
77	00:05:40	00:05:42	Um...
78	00:05:42	00:05:43	You know, I had a fish on the line.
79	00:05:43	00:05:46	Potential bidding war.
80	00:05:46	00:05:47	Look... ( clears throat )
81	00:05:47	00:05:51	I only give out the combination to people that I really trust.
82	00:05:55	00:05:56	All right, look, I read rooms for a living.
83	00:05:57	00:05:59	That closet was tossed. The carpet lit up.
84	00:05:59	00:06:01	So I'm going to ask you again.
85	00:06:01	00:06:03	What were you doing in there besides copulating?
86	00:06:05	00:06:07	It was my idea.
87	00:06:07	00:06:11	Right. Well, we found this laptop on the vanity still on.
88	00:06:11	00:06:13	You didn't play with it, too, did you?
89	00:06:18	00:06:20	Hey, Warrick.
90	00:06:20	00:06:21	Check this out.
91	00:06:24	00:06:26	It's a little thin for blood, isn't it?
92	00:06:26	00:06:28	Yeah.
93	00:06:31	00:06:34	What do you...?
94	00:06:34	00:06:37	Tastes like sugar water.
95	00:06:37	00:06:38	Erythrosine.
96	00:06:38	00:06:40	Red dye number three.
97	00:06:40	00:06:43	Hummingbirds do love the color red.
98	00:06:43	00:06:46	You've been watching way too much Discovery Channel.
99	00:06:46	00:06:48	This guy needs a girl.
100	00:06:49	00:06:51	I'm going to check out the cabana.
101	00:06:51	00:06:52	No visible footprints.
102	00:06:52	00:06:54	Doesn't mean someone wasn't out here.
103	00:06:55	00:06:56	Grab the LS.
104	00:06:56	00:06:58	Yeah.
105	00:07:00	00:07:01	Hey. Sara.
106	00:07:03	00:07:05	I am so sorry.
107	00:07:05	00:07:08	I paged you two hours ago.
108	00:07:08	00:07:09	Right. Uh, it's my day off.
109	00:07:10	00:07:11	I was up in Pahrump at some vineyard.
110	00:07:12	00:07:13	You told me to get a life, remember?
111	00:07:13	00:07:14	Did I?
112	00:07:17	00:07:18	I'm sorry, but I needed you.
113	00:07:19	00:07:21	Dispatch called in a 419 at Tuscadero High School.
114	00:07:21	00:07:22	You're on your own.
115	00:07:22	00:07:24	On my own?
116	00:07:24	00:07:27	Solo.
117	00:07:31	00:07:33	See you around.
118	00:07:34	00:07:36	Solo?
119	00:07:38	00:07:42	So does this mean when I come in on my day off I get to work solo?
120	00:07:42	00:07:44	Process.
121	00:07:51	00:07:54	Whoa.
122	00:07:54	00:07:58	I got what looks like two sets of prints.
123	00:08:00	00:08:04	Ballpark in a size ten from the house.
124	00:08:04	00:08:07	And what looks like a...
125	00:08:07	00:08:13	size 12, possibly from the pool.
126	00:08:13	00:08:16	There were definitely two guys here, Griss.
127	00:08:16	00:08:19	Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.
128	00:08:19	00:08:20	Hey, fellas.
129	00:08:20	00:08:24	Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind.
130	00:08:24	00:08:26	Couldn't have gone far.
131	00:08:26	00:08:29	I got his wallet, credit card and keys.
132	00:08:31	00:08:32	You hear that?
133	00:08:32	00:08:33	What is that?
134	00:08:33	00:08:35	Oh, yeah, it's the pool.
135	00:08:35	00:08:36	It's been doing it all night.
136	00:08:36	00:08:38	Sounds like it's clogged.
137	00:08:38	00:08:40	Did someone check this pool?
138	00:08:40	00:08:44	First officer said it was clear.
139	00:08:44	00:08:46	Does that pool look clear to you?
140	00:08:47	00:08:49	Uh... no.
141	00:08:51	00:08:54	One of you guys is going in.
142	00:09:05	00:09:06	I'll go in the pool.
143	00:09:44	00:09:46	Oh, man!
144	00:09:46	00:09:48	Male D.B.
145	00:09:55	00:09:56	You have dinner yet?
146	00:09:56	00:09:58	Yeah. Why?
147	00:09:58	00:10:01	You might be seeing it again.
148	00:10:04	00:10:06	Mandy Kirk.
149	00:10:06	00:10:07	Seventeen.
150	00:10:07	00:10:08	Seventeen.
151	00:10:08	00:10:09	Senior.
152	00:10:09	00:10:11	Janitor found her.
153	00:10:11	00:10:13	Hi, David. Hey.
154	00:10:20	00:10:22	Eviscerated.
155	00:10:22	00:10:23	Maybe a wild animal.
156	00:10:23	00:10:26	They picked up a mountain lion last week in Henderson.
157	00:10:26	00:10:28	Suburbs are encroaching on the hinterlands.
158	00:10:28	00:10:31	We'll know more after the autopsy.
159	00:10:31	00:10:35	It's a cheerleader.
160	00:10:35	00:10:37	She had to have good lungs.
161	00:10:37	00:10:40	How come nobody heard her scream?
162	00:10:49	00:10:51	Didn't have to do much of a Y.
163	00:10:51	00:10:53	Attack did it for me.
164	00:10:53	00:10:54	Died of exsanguination.
165	00:10:54	00:10:55	Bled out.
166	00:10:55	00:10:58	Trauma to her internal organs.
167	00:10:58	00:11:01	Spleen, liver, heart they all sustained multiple mastications.
168	00:11:01	00:11:03	Hmm.
169	00:11:03	00:11:04	You able to isolate the species?
170	00:11:04	00:11:07	From the tooth mark on her left ninth rib.
171	00:11:11	00:11:12	Dog maybe?
172	00:11:13	00:11:15	Teeth marks are too small for a mountain cat.
173	00:11:15	00:11:16	They're human.
174	00:11:16	00:11:19	You're lying.
175	00:11:22	00:11:27	You can see the bridgework on this impression of a premolar and an adjoining molar.
176	00:11:27	00:11:31	Can you tell how old the attacker is?
177	00:11:31	00:11:35	Well, I can't give you the exact age but wisdom teeth erupt between 16 and 30.
178	00:11:35	00:11:38	And there's no evidence of a wisdom molar on this impression.
179	00:11:38	00:11:39	Thanks.
180	00:11:42	00:11:43	Oh, one more thing.
181	00:11:43	00:11:47	I found an infection in the mucus overlying the large intestine.
182	00:11:47	00:11:50	This girl suffered from the E-coli bacteria.
183	00:11:50	00:11:52	E-coli?
184	00:11:52	00:11:53	Unsanitary conditions?
185	00:11:53	00:11:55	Or a bad burger.
186	00:11:55	00:12:00	So whoever did this to her also has E-coli.
187	00:12:00	00:12:01	Oh, yeah.
188	00:12:01	00:12:04	Spiked temp, vomiting, lower GI problems, the works.
189	00:12:04	00:12:07	Smoking gun.
190	00:12:46	00:12:49	I mean, I don't get it.
191	00:12:49	00:12:54	She's not even slated to work she comes in on her day off and she gets to work solo.
192	00:12:54	00:12:57	You still harping on the solo thing?
193	00:12:57	00:13:00	You know every time you work with me you learn something.
194	00:13:03	00:13:05	Is that right? Yes.
195	00:13:05	00:13:07	I live here. Why can't I go in?
196	00:13:07	00:13:09	I want to see my father.
197	00:13:09	00:13:12	I'm Cal's ex-wife, Jeri Newman and this is our son Max.
198	00:13:12	00:13:14	We have the right to an answer.
199	00:13:14	00:13:16	And we have a right to protect the crime scene.
200	00:13:16	00:13:18	What's going on?
201	00:13:18	00:13:21	I can't tell you anything until I get all the details.
202	00:13:21	00:13:22	I'm sorry.
203	00:13:22	00:13:23	Catherine?
204	00:13:27	00:13:32	We need someone to identify the body.
205	00:13:32	00:13:33	Ms. Newman.
206	00:13:33	00:13:35	Would you come with me, please?
207	00:13:35	00:13:37	What about me?
208	00:13:37	00:13:38	Uh, no, honey.
209	00:13:38	00:13:40	You stay right here.
210	00:13:43	00:13:45	No skin separation.
211	00:13:45	00:13:46	Minimal gaseous buildup.
212	00:13:46	00:13:48	This guy's been in here under 12 hours.
213	00:13:48	00:13:51	00.
214	00:13:51	00:13:52	It's about right.
215	00:13:58	00:14:00	What is that, some kind of filter?
216	00:14:00	00:14:02	It's an anti-vortex filter.
217	00:14:03	00:14:05	Hey, I'm from Jersey, we swim at the shore.
218	00:14:06	00:14:10	It's designed to keep his hand out of that pipe.
219	00:14:10	00:14:12	But it's missing a few screws.
220	00:14:14	00:14:18	Ms. Newman, is this your ex-husband?
221	00:14:20	00:14:21	It's Cal.
222	00:14:35	00:14:36	Virtual tour.
223	00:14:36	00:14:37	Right on, Archie.
224	00:14:37	00:14:41	Before and after photos of the crime scene.
225	00:14:41	00:14:43	Thank you, thank you very much.
226	00:14:43	00:14:47	It was on the hard drive of the computer you got at the crime scene.
227	00:14:47	00:14:50	Looks like a Peter Croft sculpture.
228	00:14:50	00:14:52	You know your art. You a collector?
229	00:14:52	00:14:53	What? On my salary?
230	00:14:53	00:14:56	Guggenheim's as close as I get to something like that.
231	00:14:57	00:14:58	Oh, I haven't been yet.
232	00:14:58	00:14:59	Really?
233	00:14:59	00:15:02	Well, if you want a tour, I know a docent.
234	00:15:02	00:15:04	A docent.
235	00:15:04	00:15:05	So, you think that's legit?
236	00:15:06	00:15:08	House like this, probably not a knock-off.
237	00:15:09	00:15:10	You'd be surprised.
238	00:15:10	00:15:12	The rich go cheap to stay rich, know what I mean?
239	00:15:12	00:15:14	Yeah. Let me show you the after photos.
240	00:15:14	00:15:16	Please.
241	00:15:16	00:15:18	Same spot.
242	00:15:18	00:15:20	And, uh, what happened to the sculpture?
243	00:15:20	00:15:22	Good question.
244	00:15:22	00:15:24	You saying somebody lifted it?
245	00:15:24	00:15:26	Well, they don't call them open houses for nothing.
246	00:15:26	00:15:29	Put your house on the market your privacy's up for grabs, too.
247	00:15:29	00:15:34	The Newmans unlocked their door to anybody with Internet access.
248	00:15:38	00:15:39	Soccer bunnies?
249	00:15:39	00:15:41	What are soccer bunnies?
250	00:15:41	00:15:43	Well, each cheerleader is assigned a soccer player.
251	00:15:43	00:15:44	She's his bunny.
252	00:15:44	00:15:49	Gives him gifts the night before the big game places his wake-up call.
253	00:15:49	00:15:50	Sounds sexual.
254	00:15:50	00:15:53	Yeah, that's what I asked the principal but he said no.
255	00:15:53	00:15:55	He said that, uh it's all good, clean fun.
256	00:15:55	00:16:00	Gifts are inspirational videos like, uh, Rocky and wake-up calls are pep talks, nothing more.
257	00:16:00	00:16:04	Yeah, well, I'm not sure the principal's up to speed on teenagers' sexual habits.
258	00:16:04	00:16:07	Yeah, well, victim Mandy was soccer bunny to a Chuck Darwell.
259	00:16:08	00:16:14	And when I called him on his cell this morning he said that he hooked up with Mandy after every game except last night.
260	00:16:14	00:16:16	Said he hadn't seen her last night.
261	00:16:16	00:16:18	He in class? Hospital.
262	00:16:18	00:16:20	Got rushed there two minutes ago.
263	00:16:24	00:16:26	I bet I know why.
264	00:16:31	00:16:32	No surprise here.
265	00:16:32	00:16:33	He drowned.
266	00:16:33	00:16:37	We found his right hand caught in a pool filter.
267	00:16:37	00:16:40	Lack of bruising, no bleeding wounds.
268	00:16:41	00:16:45	Indicates his circulatory system had stopped.
269	00:16:45	00:16:47	This was postmortem.
270	00:16:53	00:16:57	Any significance to the marks on his chest?
271	00:16:57	00:16:58	Uh, don't know. Not a rash.
272	00:16:58	00:17:00	Some kind of abrasion.
273	00:17:00	00:17:03	Maybe even a friction burn.
274	00:17:03	00:17:04	Definitely peri-mortem.
275	00:17:04	00:17:10	X-rays reveal several broken ribs and he's got a bruise on his forehead.
276	00:17:10	00:17:12	He could have taken a bad fall.
277	00:17:12	00:17:14	Or he could have been beaten.
278	00:17:14	00:17:16	Maybe.
279	00:17:16	00:17:17	How about the new wife?
280	00:17:19	00:17:24	No physical findings for sexual assault though I did send a kit to DNA.
281	00:17:24	00:17:27	Looks like cause of death was a single gunshot to the head.
282	00:17:27	00:17:29	I'll know more later.
283	00:17:29	00:17:31	You always tell me that.
284	00:17:31	00:17:32	Yes, I do.
285	00:17:32	00:17:35	Depth of bruising gives us a timeline.
286	00:17:35	00:17:41	Apparent thumbprint on her neck came first the, uh, prints on her hands second.
287	00:17:41	00:17:43	Major impression on top.
288	00:17:43	00:17:48	It's some kind of recoil bruise on her palm.
289	00:17:49	00:17:51	She didn't shoot herself.
290	00:17:53	00:17:55	She had help.
291	00:17:56	00:18:00	Of course, no house is complete without a pool.
292	00:18:02	00:18:04	Why live in Vegas if you don't have a pool?
293	00:18:06	00:18:10	Mm, water's warm.
294	00:18:10	00:18:14	You want to come by and take a dip?
295	00:18:14	00:18:15	Quite the saleswoman.
296	00:18:15	00:18:20	Come on, take a...
297	00:18:20	00:18:23	It's got to be a fantasy of yours, huh?
298	00:18:23	00:18:25	Huh, double feature.
299	00:18:26	00:18:29	You know you want this.
300	00:18:29	00:18:31	Blam.
301	00:18:32	00:18:33	You can say that again.
302	00:18:33	00:18:34	Blam.
303	00:18:34	00:18:36	Down, boys.
304	00:18:39	00:18:43	I probably should even be saying this, but, uh...
305	00:18:43	00:18:50	sex is on my mind all the time.
306	00:18:50	00:18:53	Hey, Archie, freeze it.
307	00:18:53	00:18:55	And, uh...
308	00:18:55	00:18:56	Who's that in the background?
309	00:18:56	00:18:57	Hmm?
310	00:18:57	00:19:01	Oh, that guy in the mirror. Good.
311	00:19:01	00:19:03	Archie, help us out.
312	00:19:03	00:19:05	Yup, I got him.
313	00:19:05	00:19:06	Nice.
314	00:19:10	00:19:12	Hey this is the broker.
315	00:19:12	00:19:14	I just did a background check on that guy.
316	00:19:14	00:19:17	Half a dozen robberies in the houses he has listed.
317	00:19:17	00:19:19	Art, antiques, stuff like that.
318	00:19:19	00:19:22	Like the Peter Croft sculpture.
319	00:19:22	00:19:23	Exactly.
320	00:19:23	00:19:28	Looks like Augie was helping himself to a little bit more than the artwork.
321	00:19:30	00:19:31	I understand, Mr. Darwell.
322	00:19:31	00:19:33	Have your son's wisdom teeth come in yet?
323	00:19:33	00:19:34	What?
324	00:19:35	00:19:38	Whoever killed Amanda Kirk ingested her organs, Mr. Darwell. Left teeth marks.
325	00:19:38	00:19:40	Excuse me.
326	00:19:40	00:19:42	Hi, uh, Chuck, I'm with the crime lab.
327	00:19:42	00:19:44	I'm going to ask you to show me your back teeth.
328	00:19:44	00:19:47	Give us an odontological impression.
329	00:19:48	00:19:50	I didn't see Mandy last night, I swear.
330	00:19:50	00:19:53	You have no legal right to question or to touch my son.
331	00:19:53	00:19:54	I want you out of here.
332	00:19:54	00:19:56	Now.
333	00:19:56	00:19:57	Is that stomach contents?
334	00:19:57	00:19:59	That's right, officer.
335	00:20:01	00:20:03	Anything he throw up no longer belongs to him.
336	00:20:03	00:20:04	PD, public domain.
337	00:20:05	00:20:07	It's going to tell us everything we need to know.
338	00:20:07	00:20:09	Look, anyone could have lifted that Peter Croft.
339	00:20:09	00:20:11	I thought this was about murder.
340	00:20:11	00:20:12	Oh, it is.
341	00:20:13	00:20:14	Excuse me.
342	00:20:14	00:20:16	Yeah?
343	00:20:16	00:20:17	Hey, yeah...
344	00:20:17	00:20:18	Hey, can I call you back?
345	00:20:19	00:20:21	Okay, then.
346	00:20:21	00:20:22	Bye-bye.
347	00:20:22	00:20:24	I'm sorry, where were we?
348	00:20:24	00:20:25	The tape.
349	00:20:25	00:20:29	It wasn't anybody's face on that tape, it was your face.
350	00:20:29	00:20:31	I recorded their house for the virtual tour.
351	00:20:31	00:20:33	That's what I do to sell houses.
352	00:20:33	00:20:37	Selling house as a front for porno a little blackmail on the side.
353	00:20:37	00:20:38	What are you talking about?
354	00:20:38	00:20:39	I have done nothing wrong.
355	00:20:39	00:20:41	Oh, you're innocent in all this?
356	00:20:41	00:20:45	I admit to having lust in my heart.
357	00:20:45	00:20:47	Lust doesn't live in your heart.
358	00:20:49	00:20:51	I'm going to need that DNA sample.
359	00:20:51	00:20:53	Well, my DNA is your DNA.
360	00:20:53	00:20:54	Great.
361	00:20:54	00:21:00	Look, for what it's worth I can tell you at least one guy other than her husband that saw Monica in the buff on a weekly basis.
362	00:21:00	00:21:01	Say, ah.
363	00:21:01	00:21:02	Ah.
364	00:21:03	00:21:05	You must get a lot of ass on a job like this, huh?
365	00:21:05	00:21:07	I'm the pool guy, it's one of the perks of the job.
366	00:21:07	00:21:10	One minute I'm scooping leaves the next I'm staring at...
367	00:21:10	00:21:11	Yeah, I get it.
368	00:21:12	00:21:16	The last time you were there did you happen to see anything out of the ordinary?
369	00:21:17	00:21:18	What? You mean sexual?
370	00:21:18	00:21:19	Maybe.
371	00:21:19	00:21:21	No.
372	00:21:21	00:21:22	But, uh...
373	00:21:22	00:21:23	Newman had a temper.
374	00:21:23	00:21:26	He and his kid Max were always going at it.
375	00:21:26	00:21:28	What are these, huh?
376	00:21:28	00:21:29	Where did you get these?!
377	00:21:29	00:21:34	I thought the old man was going to beat his ass but... Newman just screamed some more and took off.
378	00:21:34	00:21:37	You mind if I take a look in your cab?
379	00:21:37	00:21:38	Sure.
380	00:21:57	00:21:59	Well, that's a coincidence.
381	00:21:59	00:22:03	Newman's anti-vortex filter was missing three screws.
382	00:22:03	00:22:04	I can explain, okay?
383	00:22:04	00:22:08	I remove them screws from the filter so I'd have an excuse to go back.
384	00:22:09	00:22:10	Oh, you mean, like, a leave-behind?
385	00:22:10	00:22:12	Yeah, I figured the more I was around...
386	00:22:12	00:22:13	The more she'd want you.
387	00:22:13	00:22:14	Oh, yeah.
388	00:22:14	00:22:17	Well, the lab wants more of you, too.
389	00:22:17	00:22:21	We're going to need your fingerprints and a DNA sample.
390	00:22:21	00:22:23	Take whatever you want, I've got nothing to hide.
391	00:22:34	00:22:36	Anything from the pool?
392	00:22:36	00:22:39	Some hairs, I may have found a filling.
393	00:22:41	00:22:44	Tributlyltin oxide, aluminum sulfate quaternary ammonium.
394	00:22:44	00:22:48	Chemicals in the vic's lungs match the chemicals in the pool water.
395	00:22:48	00:22:50	Anything from his head wound?
396	00:22:50	00:22:51	Trace matches the side of the pool.
397	00:22:51	00:22:54	No surprises.
398	00:22:56	00:22:58	Mildew.
399	00:22:58	00:23:00	Hmm?
400	00:23:00	00:23:01	Aureobasidium pullulans.
401	00:23:01	00:23:05	One of the very few fungi that can withstand the desert temperature.
402	00:23:05	00:23:07	Gives us possible transfer.
403	00:23:08	00:23:11	Exactly. and here's the basic chemistry of the transfer.
404	00:23:11	00:23:21	Add sugar water spoiled from the heat mix in some human biofilm you got yourself an all-you-can-eat mildew buffet.
405	00:23:21	00:23:23	Cal Newman wore size tens.
406	00:23:23	00:23:25	So assuming our killer wore the size 12...
407	00:23:25	00:23:29	He may have transferred mildew from the pool to the house.
408	00:23:29	00:23:33	Normally I don't like to speak ill of the dead but, uh, Mr. Newman's sperm had company.
409	00:23:33	00:23:34	Bad company.
410	00:23:34	00:23:36	Look at D7.
411	00:23:36	00:23:37	Three alleles.
412	00:23:37	00:23:40	Genetics only gives you one from each parent.
413	00:23:40	00:23:43	Which can only mean one thing-- Menage d'allele.
414	00:23:43	00:23:45	She was cheating on her husband.
415	00:23:45	00:23:46	What about stutter?
416	00:23:46	00:23:48	Percentage is too high.
417	00:23:48	00:23:51	We're looking at a minor and a major sample.
418	00:23:51	00:23:52	Minor donor?
419	00:23:52	00:23:53	The husband.
420	00:23:53	00:23:54	Major donor?
421	00:23:54	00:23:55	Pool man.
422	00:23:55	00:23:56	Nope.
423	00:23:56	00:23:57	The broker?
424	00:23:58	00:23:58	Ibid.
425	00:23:58	00:24:01	Major donor is still unaccounted for.
426	00:24:08	00:24:10	How's it coming?
427	00:24:10	00:24:12	Good. I'm almost there. Hang on.
428	00:24:12	00:24:14	Sometime this year.
429	00:24:17	00:24:20	Okay, I think that's the angle.
430	00:24:20	00:24:22	All right, where do I stand?
431	00:24:22	00:24:24	Back up.
432	00:24:24	00:24:25	Keep going.
433	00:24:25	00:24:27	Keep going. Big steps?
434	00:24:27	00:24:28	Little steps?
435	00:24:28	00:24:29	Big. Keep going.
436	00:24:29	00:24:30	Keep going.
437	00:24:30	00:24:32	I go any further, I'll be in the closet.
438	00:24:32	00:24:34	Well, go in the closet.
439	00:24:37	00:24:39	Oh, you got to be kidding me.
440	00:24:39	00:24:40	What?
441	00:24:40	00:24:43	How's this?
442	00:24:43	00:24:45	What the hell is that?
443	00:24:53	00:24:56	These slime will do anything to sell a house, huh?
444	00:24:56	00:24:58	Sometimes, reflections beget reflections.
445	00:24:59	00:25:04	I figured if I could get a glimpse of the Augie cutout maybe I could get a glimpse of the cameraman.
446	00:25:05	00:25:06	Check out the lamp.
447	00:25:23	00:25:24	Her stepson, Max.
448	00:25:24	00:25:28	Did you get any DNA off the cigarette butts?
449	00:25:28	00:25:30	Yeah, we did.
450	00:25:30	00:25:35	So, let's get Greg to compare the reference sample and see if we found our major donor.
451	00:25:51	00:25:54	Driving someone else's porcelain bus?
452	00:25:54	00:25:57	Suspect's dinner from last night.
453	00:25:57	00:25:59	The coroner left this in your mail slot.
454	00:25:59	00:26:01	Can you read it for me?
455	00:26:04	00:26:06	What's this look like, Greg?
456	00:26:06	00:26:07	Uh, Caesar salad.
457	00:26:07	00:26:12	Oh, and Pele used an interesting dressing.
458	00:26:12	00:26:13	PCP.
459	00:26:13	00:26:16	Angel dust. Hallucinogen.
460	00:26:16	00:26:17	Well, it acts like one.
461	00:26:21	00:26:22	Disassociative anesthetic.
462	00:26:22	00:26:24	Brain disassociates from the body.
463	00:26:24	00:26:26	Yeah, after it takes you through the paces.
464	00:26:26	00:26:27	How many milligrams?
465	00:26:27	00:26:29	Uh... 20.
466	00:26:29	00:26:31	Dude's dose was off the charts.
467	00:26:31	00:26:33	I'm surprised he's still alive.
468	00:26:33	00:26:34	Yeah.
469	00:26:34	00:26:37	Too bad everybody didn't make it.
470	00:26:44	00:26:47	Tell me this is raw chicken skin.
471	00:26:49	00:26:54	Well, it's raw... and it's definitely skin.
472	00:27:00	00:27:02	My son was nowhere near that pool.
473	00:27:02	00:27:03	He was at...
474	00:27:03	00:27:04	Red Rock Canyon. A field trip.
475	00:27:04	00:27:06	Oh, I'm getting that.
476	00:27:06	00:27:08	What I'm not getting is this.
477	00:27:10	00:27:12	Oh, now, this is disgusting.
478	00:27:13	00:27:17	Look, whatever Cal wanted to do behind closed doors, that was his business.
479	00:27:17	00:27:19	This is not for my eyes or for his eyes.
480	00:27:20	00:27:23	This is not the first time, is it, Max?
481	00:27:31	00:27:33	Can I plead the Fifth or something?
482	00:27:33	00:27:39	Max we found two sperm donors on the sample from your stepmother.
483	00:27:39	00:27:41	Your father's and yours.
484	00:27:41	00:27:43	Now I know why you were spending all that time at your father's.
485	00:27:43	00:27:45	Mom, look, I...
486	00:27:48	00:27:49	Mom...
487	00:27:50	00:27:51	I don't want to hear a word from you.
488	00:27:51	00:27:55	Well, let me lay it out for you.
489	00:28:02	00:28:04	So you must've thought you won the lottery.
490	00:28:04	00:28:08	And the only thing standing between you and the winning ticket was your father.
491	00:28:18	00:28:20	What's your shoe size, Max?
492	00:28:20	00:28:22	Twelve.
493	00:28:23	00:28:24	This can't be happening.
494	00:28:25	00:28:26	Yes, it's happening.
495	00:28:26	00:28:27	Okay, this is a fling.
496	00:28:27	00:28:28	Okay, it's not real.
497	00:28:28	00:28:30	You're confused. You're a kid.
498	00:28:30	00:28:34	I killed my father for you.
499	00:28:34	00:28:37	That's not possible.
500	00:28:37	00:28:39	How come?
501	00:28:39	00:28:41	Because I can't swim.
502	00:28:43	00:28:45	He's telling the truth.
503	00:28:45	00:28:50	When Max was a child he had this terrible pool accident.
504	00:28:50	00:28:53	He nearly drowned.
505	00:29:04	00:29:06	We need that report, ASAP.
506	00:29:08	00:29:10	Your temperature is spiking.
507	00:29:10	00:29:16	Of course, you didn't know Mandy had E. coli when you... ate her, did you?
508	00:29:16	00:29:18	No, no, I would never do that.
509	00:29:18	00:29:20	You would on PCP.
510	00:29:21	00:29:25	Normal brain, neurons send a message synapses blink on and off.
511	00:29:25	00:29:29	On PCP, synapses never stop firing.
512	00:29:29	00:29:32	Like your entire brain is on constant DSL.
513	00:29:34	00:29:37	You and Mandy were on the soccer field.
514	00:29:37	00:29:38	You were cranked up.
515	00:29:38	00:29:40	Do you remember anything?
516	00:29:46	00:29:48	Yeah.
517	00:29:49	00:29:52	But I don't remember killing her. I swear to God.
518	00:29:52	00:29:54	Lieutenant Lockwood's going to arrest you.
519	00:29:54	00:29:57	We'll assign you an advocate.
520	00:29:59	00:30:02	So, how does a kid who can't swim drown his father?
521	00:30:02	00:30:03	The kid didn't do it.
522	00:30:03	00:30:06	Look, we found the father's blood on the underside of the pool ledge.
523	00:30:06	00:30:09	And his body at the bottom of the pool with abrasions on his chest.
524	00:30:10	00:30:12	So there was a struggle in the water.
525	00:30:13	00:30:14	With someone who can swim.
526	00:30:15	00:30:15	Right.
527	00:30:21	00:30:24	You cannot be serious!
528	00:30:24	00:30:27	Hey, John McEnroe, where's the game?
529	00:30:27	00:30:33	All the prints are accounted for by people who had a reason to be in the Newman house all the way down to the vortex cover, Warrick.
530	00:30:33	00:30:34	Prints came back to the pool boy.
531	00:30:34	00:30:43	Yeah. Yeah, so all I've got is an errant blond hair a tooth filling and some detritus from the bottom of the pool.
532	00:30:43	00:30:46	All right, now, don't get your panties in a bunch.
533	00:30:46	00:30:51	Uh, so we got the blond hair, the tooth filling...
534	00:30:51	00:30:52	That's it, huh?
535	00:30:52	00:30:53	Yeah.
536	00:30:53	00:30:58	I mean, I did identify some Neoprene and it was white.
537	00:30:58	00:30:59	White Neoprene.
538	00:30:59	00:31:00	Yeah.
539	00:31:00	00:31:02	Like in a wet suit Neoprene?
540	00:31:03	00:31:05	Was the vic a diver?
541	00:31:05	00:31:06	Not that I know of.
542	00:31:06	00:31:09	The son can't even swim.
543	00:31:09	00:31:10	Let's think about that.
544	00:31:10	00:31:15	Who wears a white wet suit in a pool?
545	00:31:15	00:31:17	Scuba diver.
546	00:31:17	00:31:18	Or a professional.
547	00:31:18	00:31:21	A professional.
548	00:31:21	00:31:24	No, I mean like a hired gun professional.
549	00:31:24	00:31:27	Yeah.
550	00:31:35	00:31:36	Tooth hurt?
551	00:31:38	00:31:46	You might, uh, need your filling which we found at the bottom of the Newmans' pool.
552	00:31:46	00:31:50	We also found your fingerprints and your hair.
553	00:31:50	00:31:54	Look, I'm sure you'll find me all over the house.
554	00:31:54	00:31:55	I wanted to buy it.
555	00:31:55	00:31:57	I was everywhere.
556	00:31:57	00:32:00	Well, you made sure you were everywhere, too, didn't you?
557	00:32:00	00:32:04	I wanted to thoroughly inspect the property.
558	00:32:04	00:32:05	Caveat emptor, right?
559	00:32:05	00:32:08	Or caveat venditor.
560	00:32:08	00:32:09	Let the seller beware.
561	00:32:10	00:32:12	Your prints came back military.
562	00:32:12	00:32:13	Navy Seal.
563	00:32:13	00:32:15	Ex-Navy Seal.
564	00:32:15	00:32:16	Oh, yeah, that's right.
565	00:32:16	00:32:19	You rang the bell.
566	00:32:22	00:32:26	You had the physical tools for the training but not the character.
567	00:32:26	00:32:32	And if you had anything more than a filling and a piece of Neoprene we wouldn't be here.
568	00:32:32	00:32:33	Berglund.
569	00:32:33	00:32:36	That's a Scandinavian name, isn't it?
570	00:32:37	00:32:39	That's what my parents tell me.
571	00:33:02	00:33:05	Hey, heard you nailed soccer boy for the murder.
572	00:33:05	00:33:06	Not exactly.
573	00:33:06	00:33:09	No match on the bite plate.
574	00:33:09	00:33:11	Well, maybe there was someone else with them.
575	00:33:11	00:33:14	Someone getting sicker by the minute.
576	00:33:20	00:33:22	Greg.
577	00:33:22	00:33:23	Yeah?
578	00:33:23	00:33:25	I need you to take off your shoes and socks.
579	00:33:25	00:33:33	See, now we're getting into this whole strip forensics thing and I'm not so sure I can hang with that even if you are my boss.
580	00:33:33	00:33:36	Your mother's maiden name is Hojem, correct?
581	00:33:36	00:33:37	Hojem is Norwegian?
582	00:33:37	00:33:39	Yeah.
583	00:33:39	00:33:43	And you know, my grandfather got tossed from Norway for getting my grandmother pregnant before they got married.
584	00:33:43	00:33:48	To this day, he still tells me Som man reder sa ligger man.
585	00:33:52	00:33:54	One must lie in the bed one has made.
586	00:33:54	00:33:56	That's true.
587	00:33:56	00:33:57	Right foot first, please.
588	00:34:00	00:34:01	Now, you're sure you want me to do this?
589	00:34:01	00:34:03	Things could get loud in here.
590	00:34:08	00:34:09	Left foot.
591	00:34:12	00:34:15	So you want to tell me why we're doing this?
592	00:34:17	00:34:19	It's an experiment.
593	00:34:20	00:34:21	Put these on.
594	00:34:21	00:34:23	Come see me in six hours.
595	00:34:34	00:34:35	Nicole Exmoor, 18.
596	00:34:35	00:34:37	School nurse said she couldn't stop throwing up.
597	00:34:37	00:34:39	Teacher found her passed out in the locker room.
598	00:34:39	00:34:40	She have an explanation?
599	00:34:40	00:34:43	Said that she ate something that didn't agree with her.
600	00:34:44	00:34:46	Nicole, do you know what E. coli is?
601	00:34:46	00:34:49	Your friend Mandy was infected with it.
602	00:34:49	00:34:52	We think we know how you got it.
603	00:34:52	00:34:53	We can test your blood for PCP...
604	00:34:53	00:34:56	Chuck brought the weed, not me.
605	00:34:56	00:34:59	This guy told him it was a really great high.
606	00:35:01	00:35:04	These photographs are...
607	00:35:04	00:35:07	of Mandy's ribs.
608	00:35:07	00:35:09	We believe these are your teeth marks.
609	00:35:13	00:35:20	Ms. Sidle can make an impression of your teeth or you can help yourself and explain what happened.
610	00:35:24	00:35:27	When Jack and I went to the field...
611	00:35:27	00:35:30	we were hooking up behind Mandy's back.
612	00:35:33	00:35:37	She showed up, she was like, He's my player.
613	00:35:37	00:35:38	Mandy!
614	00:35:39	00:35:44	I don't know what happened. I started to feel weird like my blood was surging through me.
615	00:35:47	00:35:50	It didn't make any sense.
616	00:35:53	00:35:56	I think I wanted to be her.
617	00:36:04	00:36:06	It felt...
618	00:36:06	00:36:09	It felt like somebody else walked over and did it.
619	00:36:09	00:36:12	Like she was split from my body.
620	00:36:17	00:36:21	It's called psychological detachment.
621	00:36:21	00:36:23	It's a function of PCP.
622	00:36:43	00:36:46	It's like out of a really bad dream.
623	00:36:46	00:36:49	Nicole, I was at Mandy's autopsy.
624	00:36:49	00:36:52	It was not a dream.
625	00:37:03	00:37:08	I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Amanda Kirk.
626	00:37:17	00:37:19	What's going to happen to me?
627	00:37:21	00:37:23	That's up to the D.A.
628	00:37:32	00:37:39	Hey, Cyrus, next time somebody says experimenting with drugs is harmless remind me of this.
629	00:37:46	00:37:49	What did you do to me?
630	00:37:49	00:37:51	You had a reaction.
631	00:37:51	00:37:54	I'm Hazmat meat.
632	00:37:54	00:37:56	Quarantine, here I come.
633	00:37:57	00:38:01	Your right foot, I swabbed with a placebo, regular tap water.
634	00:38:01	00:38:03	Yeah, well, I'm not worried about the right foot.
635	00:38:03	00:38:06	Left foot... eumycotic dermatitis.
636	00:38:06	00:38:07	Oh, great.
637	00:38:07	00:38:09	It's probably fatal.
638	00:38:09	00:38:11	It's a mildew-induced skin rash.
639	00:38:11	00:38:15	You infected me with mildew?
640	00:38:19	00:38:20	Here. Hydrocortisone.
641	00:38:20	00:38:23	Follow the directions, clear it right up.
642	00:38:25	00:38:29	It's called Aureobasidium pullulans.
643	00:38:29	00:38:32	Is that supposed to mean something to me?
644	00:38:34	00:38:35	It may.
645	00:38:35	00:38:38	This is a warrant.
646	00:38:39	00:38:42	To see my feet?
647	00:38:42	00:38:44	Yes, both of them.
648	00:38:44	00:38:46	Take off your shoes and socks, please.
649	00:38:47	00:38:50	Aureobasidium pullulans is a mildew.
650	00:38:50	00:38:52	We found it around the Newmans' pool.
651	00:38:52	00:39:01	It induces rashes in people of Scandinavian descent-- and it does so in a predictable progression which provides us with a valuable timeline.
652	00:39:06	00:39:07	You have the rash.
653	00:39:12	00:39:14	And size 12 feet.
654	00:39:22	00:39:25	Let me tell you how you did this.
655	00:40:14	00:40:16	And then you went upstairs.
656	00:40:16	00:40:17	Cal?
657	00:40:20	00:40:25	You're still going to have to convince a jury that I killed two strangers for no reason.
658	00:40:29	00:40:32	You ever been to the theater, Peter?
659	00:40:32	00:40:35	There's a play called Six Degrees of Separation.
660	00:40:35	00:40:40	It's about how all the people in the world are connected to each other by no more than six people.
661	00:40:40	00:40:45	All it takes to connect you to the victims is one degree.
662	00:40:49	00:40:51	Peter Berglund?
663	00:40:52	00:40:55	No, I don't recall ever having met somebody by that name.
664	00:40:55	00:40:58	Well, do you recall living in San Diego?
665	00:40:58	00:41:01	What does that have to do with anything?
666	00:41:01	00:41:02	Oh, it just might help jog your memory.
667	00:41:02	00:41:04	San Diego's a military town.
668	00:41:04	00:41:06	Your sister married a guy in the Navy, right?
669	00:41:06	00:41:08	Did you really bring me in here just for this?
670	00:41:08	00:41:11	Well, we could go someplace else if you'd like.
671	00:41:11	00:41:14	How about your house?
672	00:41:14	00:41:16	The one you're selling.
673	00:41:16	00:41:18	What's this?
674	00:41:18	00:41:25	Well, you see, we didn't have enough evidence at this point to get a warrant but you put your house on the Internet.
675	00:41:25	00:41:27	I didn't need a warrant.
676	00:41:27	00:41:32	Gave me complete access via this virtual tour.
677	00:41:32	00:41:35	And all with your permission.
678	00:41:42	00:41:45	That's you... that's Peter Berglund...
679	00:41:46	00:41:47	and that's the Pacific.
680	00:41:48	00:41:49	So what?
681	00:41:49	00:41:51	I know Peter.
682	00:41:51	00:41:53	Yeah.
683	00:41:53	00:41:57	You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife.
684	00:41:57	00:41:59	The picture doesn't prove anything.
685	00:41:59	00:42:03	No, but it did give me access to Peter's financial information.
686	00:42:06	00:42:10	Loan application. Two signatures-- Peter Berglund and yours.
687	00:42:10	00:42:13	You cosigned for Peter because he couldn't qualify on his own.
688	00:42:13	00:42:15	Payment for the hit.
689	00:42:15	00:42:18	He gets your house you get your ex-husband's money.
690	00:42:18	00:42:21	The thing about murder for hire...
691	00:42:21	00:42:23	there's always a paper trail.
692	00:42:31	00:42:33	Good night.
693	00:42:34	00:42:36	Good night, Sara.
694	00:42:39	00:42:40	Hey.
695	00:42:42	00:42:45	Nice work on the high school case.
696	00:42:47	00:42:49	I'm, uh...
697	00:42:51	00:42:53	...sorry I missed your page.
698	00:42:53	00:42:56	It's just, um...
699	00:42:56	00:43:00	you tell me to get a life and then I get one, and...
700	00:43:00	00:43:04	then you expect me to be there at a moment's notice.
701	00:43:04	00:43:08	It's, um, confusing.
