0	00:00:42	00:00:44	Billie! ( groaning )
1	00:00:45	00:00:48	Oh, my God, Billie, are you okay?
2	00:00:48	00:00:50	What did you hit?
3	00:00:54	00:01:05	So, according to the girl, one minute she's blasting through the mud and having fun, everything's great, the next thing she knows, she's lying upside down in the dirt, staring at chemical waste.
4	00:01:05	00:01:06	She called Hazmat.
5	00:01:06	00:01:07	Now, it's not toxic.
6	00:01:07	00:01:11	They saw the barrel was buckling, they thought it might explode, so they opened it.
7	00:01:11	00:01:12	Ugh!
8	00:01:13	00:01:14	Yeah, whoa-ho.
9	00:01:15	00:01:16	Soap mummy.
10	00:01:16	00:01:20	Adipocere, a.k.a. mortuary wax.
11	00:01:20	00:01:25	This is what you get when fatty tissue decomposes in an alkaline environment with limited oxygen.
12	00:01:25	00:01:28	All you need is a little moisture and enough time.
13	00:01:29	00:01:34	Anaerobic bacteria digest body fats, converting them into a waxy solid.
14	00:01:34	00:01:37	Kind of like the way they make vegetable shortening.
15	00:01:37	00:01:39	I'll never eat another French fry.
16	00:01:39	00:01:40	How long you think he's been in there?
17	00:01:40	00:01:41	How do you know it's a he?
18	00:01:41	00:01:42	Five, six weeks, minimum.
19	00:01:43	00:01:47	With all this wind and weather, any evidence of the dump is long gone.
20	00:01:48	00:01:49	We got evidence.
21	00:01:50	00:01:52	Signed, sealed and delivered.
22	00:02:25	00:02:30	Gentlemen, saponification occurs most frequently in infant burials.
23	00:02:30	00:02:36	That's because their bodies have more fat, and their bacterial flora aren't fully developed.
24	00:02:36	00:02:38	Slowly.
25	00:02:41	00:02:41	Ugh.
26	00:02:41	00:02:42	Look at this.
27	00:02:42	00:02:43	Hmm.
28	00:02:43	00:02:45	Something for Catherine.
29	00:02:47	00:02:50	Let's get the rest of this out.
30	00:02:50	00:02:58	Historically, saponified corpses that maintain their physical features were looked upon as, uh, incorruptible, even saintly.
31	00:02:58	00:03:02	So, when it happened to children, it just reinforced that notion.
32	00:03:03	00:03:04	Hand me that foot there, would you?
33	00:03:04	00:03:07	Okay. ( gagging )
34	00:03:07	00:03:20	You know, interestingly enough, since formaldehyde is alkaline and American caskets are sealed, there are more bodies in this country turning to soap now than at any other time in human history.
35	00:03:20	00:03:24	We are, in fact, the adipocere capital of the world.
36	00:03:24	00:03:27	USA-- we're number one.
37	00:03:31	00:03:32	Are you serious?
38	00:03:32	00:03:33	David lost a body?
39	00:03:34	00:03:35	It happens.
40	00:03:35	00:03:40	When I was working in Minneapolis, we had two John Smiths come in on the same day.
41	00:03:40	00:03:42	Sent the wrong one back to Canada.
42	00:03:42	00:03:44	Anyway, our body's still in the morgue.
43	00:03:44	00:03:47	David finally processed his ten card.
44	00:03:47	00:03:49	Guy's name is Keith Mercer.
45	00:03:49	00:03:50	When did he come in?
46	00:03:50	00:03:51	11 days ago.
47	00:03:51	00:03:55	Found him in an alley off of Fremont in a pile of garbage next to the dumpster.
48	00:03:56	00:03:57	11 days ago.
49	00:03:58	00:04:01	I guess we got no more crime scene to process, huh?
50	00:04:01	00:04:04	Initially, the police thought he was homeless.
51	00:04:04	00:04:10	He hadn't bathed, no wallet, watch or keys, and he has scars on his lower legs.
52	00:04:10	00:04:13	And a nice laceration with ecchymosis on his left temple.
53	00:04:13	00:04:16	Yeah, cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.
54	00:04:16	00:04:18	Could have been an accident.
55	00:04:18	00:04:19	Could have been a lot of things.
56	00:04:21	00:04:25	Evidence without context is ambiguous at best.
57	00:04:31	00:04:33	Did you ever chop wood, split a log?
58	00:04:34	00:04:35	I've seen it done.
59	00:04:36	00:04:37	You should try it sometime.
60	00:04:37	00:04:39	I find it relaxing.
61	00:04:39	00:04:41	Mmm.
62	00:04:41	00:04:44	The blow here was delivered in a similar fashion.
63	00:04:44	00:04:47	The temporal bone was hit, driven down hard.
64	00:04:47	00:04:48	Upper palate smashed.
65	00:04:48	00:04:50	Most of the teeth gone.
66	00:04:50	00:04:52	What about the foot?
67	00:04:52	00:04:54	It looks as though that's been sheared off.
68	00:04:54	00:04:56	Yeah, by something fast and powerful.
69	00:04:56	00:04:57	Industrial accident?
70	00:04:57	00:05:00	No, industrial accidents are messy.
71	00:05:00	00:05:01	These cuts are too clean.
72	00:05:01	00:05:03	My guess-- single impact.
73	00:05:03	00:05:04	How about an axe then?
74	00:05:06	00:05:08	Possible. I'll cast the tool marks.
75	00:05:08	00:05:11	Body in a drum in the middle of the mountains.
76	00:05:11	00:05:13	Well, if the head and hands were missing, I'd be saying mob hit.
77	00:05:14	00:05:16	Could be ritual mutilation or fetish murder.
78	00:05:16	00:05:20	So, ID from dental records is out.
79	00:05:20	00:05:21	How about DNA?
80	00:05:21	00:05:24	Bone marrow may still be viable.
81	00:05:24	00:05:25	My thoughts exactly.
82	00:05:25	00:05:31	The preferred sample is a large bone with a portion of joint, and we freeze, grind and sequence.
83	00:05:31	00:05:33	Want a breast or thigh?
84	00:05:33	00:05:34	It's your kitchen.
85	00:05:39	00:05:45	Hey, Sara, I don't want to cross any lines here, but, uh, I've got this buddy who's not going out with anybody...
86	00:05:45	00:05:45	No. No, no, forget it.
87	00:05:46	00:05:47	Hey, Grissom bailed.
88	00:05:47	00:05:48	You guys are with me.
89	00:05:48	00:05:50	Good.
90	00:05:50	00:05:51	He's a cool guy. No.
91	00:05:51	00:05:52	I mean, you don't...
92	00:05:52	00:05:55	Listen, just hear me out for a second.
93	00:07:43	00:07:46	Gone but not forgotten.
94	00:07:47	00:07:50	DNA hit on the soap mummy?
95	00:07:50	00:07:51	Yeah. His name was Christian Cutler.
96	00:07:51	00:07:52	You got to love CODIS.
97	00:07:52	00:07:53	What's his felony?
98	00:07:53	00:07:54	He wasn't in CODIS.
99	00:07:54	00:07:56	Department of Defense Registry.
100	00:07:56	00:07:57	He was in the Army.
101	00:07:58	00:08:01	An E-5 sergeant, honorably discharged three years ago.
102	00:08:01	00:08:02	The guy drove tanks.
103	00:08:02	00:08:03	Well, that fits.
104	00:08:03	00:08:05	You know that fraternity ring?
105	00:08:05	00:08:06	It's not a fraternity ring.
106	00:08:06	00:08:09	Omega Zeta Alpha is a mechanical engineering honor society.
107	00:08:09	00:08:10	Hard-core mechie.
108	00:08:11	00:08:14	Hey, hey-- want to know where his drum came from?
109	00:08:17	00:08:20	The chemical company serializes all their shipping containers.
110	00:08:20	00:08:24	That way, if hazardous waste ends up where it shouldn't be, they know where it came from.
111	00:08:25	00:08:27	This place seems lively for a warehouse.
112	00:08:27	00:08:29	A good place for a rave, though.
113	00:08:29	00:08:30	Hello.
114	00:08:30	00:08:32	The cover's 25 bucks each.
115	00:08:32	00:08:34	I got a coupon.
116	00:08:42	00:08:43	Robot rumble.
117	00:08:43	00:08:45	Demolition derby by remote control.
118	00:08:45	00:08:47	They got a show on cable TV.
119	00:08:47	00:08:49	And here comes Spiker Chick.
120	00:08:50	00:08:53	The death blade goes up, and the death blade comes down.
121	00:08:53	00:08:58	Oh! Jabba the Bot is made of titanium, but how much can he take?
122	00:09:02	00:09:08	Oh, we got a jam-up, but with this much horsepower, it won't last long.
123	00:09:09	00:09:13	Slaughter's driving Yellow Belly into the wall, trying to shake him off.
124	00:09:13	00:09:16	It's mayhem in the middle.
125	00:09:18	00:09:20	...on his back, taking a pounding.
126	00:09:20	00:09:23	And here comes Spiker Chick with the death blade.
127	00:09:23	00:09:29	Oh, no! We got a Spiker Chick sandwich!
128	00:09:29	00:09:31	Spiker Chick is going for Jabba.
129	00:09:31	00:09:34	Oh, again and again!
130	00:09:34	00:09:38	Oh, and in a dazzling array of skill and deception...
131	00:09:38	00:09:44	Metal weapons, money, competition, testosterone.
132	00:09:44	00:09:47	We got a roomful of murder suspects.
133	00:09:49	00:09:51	Jabba the Bot!
134	00:09:51	00:09:53	Whoo! Whoo-whoo!
135	00:10:03	00:10:05	Bots fight all over the country, on TV, all over the world.
136	00:10:06	00:10:10	This is an informal venue where competitors can come to hone their skills and their machines.
137	00:10:10	00:10:12	You have a gaming license?
138	00:10:12	00:10:13	I don't need one.
139	00:10:14	00:10:15	See, I just put on a show.
140	00:10:15	00:10:16	If people bet, that's their business.
141	00:10:16	00:10:18	You're the only house in Vegas that doesn't take a cut.
142	00:10:18	00:10:20	Hey, my daddy ran an independent shipping company.
143	00:10:20	00:10:21	He ran it right into the ground.
144	00:10:22	00:10:24	He died broke, but he left me a bunch of empty warehouses.
145	00:10:24	00:10:27	I needed revenue, so I developed a new market.
146	00:10:27	00:10:28	Hey, Jimbo, you looked ferocious out there.
147	00:10:28	00:10:30	Thanks, Ginger.
148	00:10:30	00:10:31	We lost.
149	00:10:31	00:10:33	Yeah, but I like a guy who goes down with style.
150	00:10:36	00:10:39	Look available, be unobtainable.
151	00:10:39	00:10:40	Keeps them coming back for more.
152	00:10:40	00:10:43	Want to tell me what this is all about?
153	00:10:46	00:10:47	That's Chris Cutler.
154	00:10:47	00:10:48	He's dead.
155	00:10:48	00:10:53	He found his body stuffed in a chemical waste drum from this warehouse.
156	00:10:53	00:10:56	When was the last time you saw Christian?
157	00:10:57	00:10:58	God, about six weeks ago.
158	00:10:58	00:11:00	Robot Rumble, big free-for-all.
159	00:11:12	00:11:15	He had the kind of night that most of these boys dream about.
160	00:11:15	00:11:19	Using the thing that he built to destroy the thing that the other guy built.
161	00:11:19	00:11:21	It's a basic male drive.
162	00:11:21	00:11:25	That kind of puts that whole weapons of mass destruction thing into perspective.
163	00:11:25	00:11:29	I take it this Chris was not well liked.
164	00:11:29	00:11:34	Let me put it to you this way-- nobody likes a winner who needs to shove it in your face.
165	00:11:34	00:11:37	We're going to need you to identify the guys he fought with that night.
166	00:11:38	00:11:39	As well as their bots.
167	00:11:39	00:11:41	We can't have a murder without a murder weapon.
168	00:11:41	00:11:42	We'll take them all.
169	00:11:46	00:11:50	Keith went to Yosemite to climb El Capitan.
170	00:11:50	00:11:52	The Shield Headwall.
171	00:11:52	00:11:54	Did you go with him?
172	00:11:54	00:11:56	I drove to Taos to see my sister.
173	00:11:56	00:11:57	And got back when?
174	00:11:57	00:11:58	Ten days ago.
175	00:11:58	00:12:01	Keith's gear was in the living room, but he wasn't there.
176	00:12:01	00:12:02	What did you do then?
177	00:12:02	00:12:03	I called his cell phone.
178	00:12:03	00:12:06	I called his office.
179	00:12:06	00:12:11	And then I called the Park Service and all they said was that Keith had been by to pick up his permit.
180	00:12:11	00:12:14	So then I checked the hospitals up there and nothing.
181	00:12:14	00:12:17	Then I called the hospitals in Vegas.
182	00:12:17	00:12:19	And then I called the police.
183	00:12:20	00:12:25	I did everything I could do and nobody would pay attention.
184	00:12:25	00:12:27	Mrs. Mercer...
185	00:12:27	00:12:30	you have my attention.
186	00:12:30	00:12:33	And I'd like to see your house.
187	00:12:37	00:12:40	Looks like his gear's all here.
188	00:12:41	00:12:43	I don't see a sleeping bag, though.
189	00:12:43	00:12:49	It looks like someone was trying to clean up, too, but forgot to use their Murphy's Oil Soap.
190	00:12:51	00:12:53	Luminol.
191	00:13:05	00:13:06	You called it.
192	00:13:06	00:13:08	Positive for blood.
193	00:13:27	00:13:29	Got a trail of bloody footprints.
194	00:13:29	00:13:30	I got blood here, too.
195	00:14:15	00:14:16	Grissom.
196	00:14:17	00:14:20	I think I might have just found our murder weapon.
197	00:14:22	00:14:27	Spiker Chick, Donsueme, Slaughter 10?
198	00:14:27	00:14:30	You really think one of these things killed your vic?
199	00:14:30	00:14:35	They're fast, they're powerful, and the weapon characteristics fit, so I can't rule them out.
200	00:14:35	00:14:39	Well, you know what they say-- it's what's on the inside that counts.
201	00:14:40	00:14:41	Well put.
202	00:15:17	00:15:19	I got blood.
203	00:15:19	00:15:20	Yeah, join the club.
204	00:15:20	00:15:22	I'll take these to Greg.
205	00:15:22	00:15:25	I'll get going on the tool marks.
206	00:16:37	00:16:39	Any luck?
207	00:16:39	00:16:40	No.
208	00:16:40	00:16:41	Tool marks don't match the vic's wounds.
209	00:16:42	00:16:43	Mm.
210	00:16:43	00:16:45	Could have saved you the time.
211	00:16:45	00:16:48	DNA beats tool marks every time, you know.
212	00:16:48	00:16:50	I ran your blood samples.
213	00:16:50	00:16:52	Got a match, all three of them.
214	00:16:52	00:16:57	Victim's blood, three different parts from three different bots?
215	00:16:58	00:16:59	That doesn't make any sense.
216	00:16:59	00:17:02	Well, where did the parts come from?
217	00:17:06	00:17:09	I buy and sell and trade parts all the time.
218	00:17:09	00:17:10	From all over the place.
219	00:17:10	00:17:12	Salvage yards, swap meets, eBay.
220	00:17:12	00:17:13	They usually have blood on them?
221	00:17:13	00:17:14	I don't check.
222	00:17:14	00:17:17	Doesn't matter if they're clean or dirty, only that they work.
223	00:17:17	00:17:19	Look, me and Chris are partners.
224	00:17:19	00:17:20	I built the bot, he drove it.
225	00:17:20	00:17:22	We kicked ass, made good cash.
226	00:17:22	00:17:24	Why would I want him dead?
227	00:17:26	00:17:29	You know, Brian, I mean...
228	00:17:30	00:17:34	your best buddy drops off the face of the earth for six weeks...
229	00:17:36	00:17:39	You get a call or e-mail or postcard? No.
230	00:17:39	00:17:44	But you care so much about him that you do absolutely nothing to find out what happened.
231	00:17:44	00:17:47	You can understand why we're here, so straighten us out.
232	00:17:47	00:17:50	There was nothing weird about Chris being gone like that.
233	00:17:50	00:17:52	He did stage effects for Pyrotechnica.
234	00:17:52	00:17:54	Have some pretty good tunes.
235	00:17:54	00:17:56	Worth listening to.
236	00:17:56	00:17:57	Or not. Anyway...
237	00:17:57	00:18:00	when Chris is on the road he's a vapor trail.
238	00:18:00	00:18:02	He's not a phone call kind of guy.
239	00:18:02	00:18:03	That's a nice ATV.
240	00:18:04	00:18:06	You ever take it to the mountains?
241	00:18:06	00:18:07	Yeah, sometimes.
242	00:18:07	00:18:09	I, uh, I dabble in ambient music.
243	00:18:09	00:18:11	She wants her father.
244	00:18:11	00:18:15	There's some pretty good samples out in the mountains, especially at night.
245	00:18:21	00:18:23	You know, you got a lot of hobbies, Brian.
246	00:18:23	00:18:26	Oh, you don't have hobbies you go nuts.
247	00:18:26	00:18:28	Human beings are designed to make things.
248	00:18:28	00:18:31	It's hard-wired into our brains.
249	00:18:31	00:18:33	We make things, we build things to make more things.
250	00:18:33	00:18:35	It's what sets us apart from the other animals.
251	00:18:35	00:18:37	Except monkeys. Primates in general, I guess.
252	00:18:37	00:18:38	Brian, Brian.
253	00:18:38	00:18:39	Yeah?
254	00:18:39	00:18:40	Hobbies take up space.
255	00:18:40	00:18:43	You don't seem to have a whole lot of that here.
256	00:18:43	00:18:44	Do you have a workshop?
257	00:18:45	00:18:47	Uh, I rent a space.
258	00:18:54	00:18:56	All right, Poindexter, we got to clear the room.
259	00:18:56	00:18:57	Come on, let's go.
260	00:18:57	00:18:59	Hey, you, down there, let's go.
261	00:18:59	00:19:01	Come on, we're clearing out.
262	00:19:01	00:19:02	Let's go.
263	00:19:02	00:19:04	Put the screwdriver down. Let's go.
264	00:19:04	00:19:06	Okay.
265	00:19:07	00:19:10	Slow day oppressing the weak?
266	00:19:10	00:19:12	Don't scuff your jackboots.
267	00:19:12	00:19:14	Let's go. Let's go.
268	00:19:23	00:19:26	Is this a machine shop or a junkyard?
269	00:19:27	00:19:30	I guess what passes for pinups with these guys.
270	00:19:38	00:19:40	This is Brian's bot right here.
271	00:19:40	00:19:42	Smash-n-Burn.
272	00:19:43	00:19:45	And it's got a spinning weapon.
273	00:19:45	00:19:48	We should take it in for tool marks.
274	00:19:49	00:19:51	And it's missing parts,too.
275	00:20:01	00:20:03	So this must be Hammer of God.
276	00:20:03	00:20:06	Or at least what's left of it.
277	00:20:08	00:20:10	Hammer of God is against the ropes.
278	00:20:12	00:20:14	Rust stain.
279	00:20:26	00:20:28	23 inches.
280	00:20:28	00:20:32	That's standard diameter for a 55-gallon drum.
281	00:20:52	00:20:55	Catherine, I've got spatter.
282	00:20:57	00:21:00	I think we've got our murder scene.
283	00:21:02	00:21:03	I think we just got Ginger.
284	00:21:08	00:21:10	We traced the machine shop back through a holding corporation.
285	00:21:11	00:21:12	To me.
286	00:21:12	00:21:13	I own it.
287	00:21:13	00:21:14	It's a rental property.
288	00:21:14	00:21:15	It's a good one.
289	00:21:15	00:21:17	It's popular with the bot boys.
290	00:21:17	00:21:19	I would have told you if you'd bothered to ask.
291	00:21:19	00:21:22	Well, we found this in Brian's station-- your fingernail.
292	00:21:24	00:21:26	They break.
293	00:21:26	00:21:27	Yeah, they also scratch.
294	00:21:27	00:21:29	There were skin scrapings under the nail.
295	00:21:30	00:21:31	We tested the epithelials.
296	00:21:31	00:21:33	They're Christian Cutler's.
297	00:21:33	00:21:39	Your shop, your fingernail, your waste drum with the dead guy in it.
298	00:21:39	00:21:43	I stop by every now and then to make sure my clients are happy.
299	00:21:43	00:21:46	Chris was there alone one night working.
300	00:21:46	00:21:48	He kind of got the wrong idea.
301	00:21:48	00:21:50	Come on. He just wants to play.
302	00:21:50	00:21:52	No, Chris, stop doing it. It's not funny.
303	00:21:52	00:21:55	Way you keep shoving those ta-tas in my face isn't funny, either.
304	00:21:58	00:22:01	And you didn't think this was... worth mentioning?
305	00:22:01	00:22:03	Hey, you guys asked me when I saw him last.
306	00:22:03	00:22:07	This happened the day before the big free-for-all.
307	00:22:07	00:22:09	So, that's the price of doing business?
308	00:22:09	00:22:11	Yeah, you could call it that.
309	00:22:11	00:22:13	Here's the way I'd call it...
310	00:22:13	00:22:16	Give me that, you son of a bitch.
311	00:22:19	00:22:22	Listen, I let the geeks fantasize about me.
312	00:22:22	00:22:29	And most of them are harmless, happy to stare and then go home and spank the monkey like good little college boys.
313	00:22:29	00:22:33	But Chris was a dumb, vicious Army grunt.
314	00:22:33	00:22:38	And maybe I wasn't as careful around him as I should have been, but that doesn't mean that I killed him.
315	00:23:44	00:23:48	Mrs. Mercer, we found this statue on your mantle.
316	00:23:48	00:23:50	It had your fingerprints on it.
317	00:23:50	00:23:51	It was a wedding gift.
318	00:23:51	00:23:55	Well, we also found your husband's blood on the base of it.
319	00:23:58	00:24:02	Did you touch or move this statue at any time in the last ten days?
320	00:24:02	00:24:03	Keith hated that thing.
321	00:24:03	00:24:05	He was always trying to toss it.
322	00:24:05	00:24:08	When I came home, I found it on the floor.
323	00:24:08	00:24:11	I thought he'd put it there.
324	00:24:11	00:24:14	I found it in the hall closet, in the garage.
325	00:24:14	00:24:16	I even found it in the car once.
326	00:24:16	00:24:18	It was like a game for us.
327	00:24:20	00:24:23	Look, I came to you.
328	00:24:23	00:24:26	You guys have been giving me the runaround for over a week.
329	00:24:26	00:24:31	Could you tell us what you kept in this box?
330	00:24:35	00:24:38	We inherited a coin collection, and we figured...
331	00:24:39	00:24:42	we'd save it for a rainy day.
332	00:24:49	00:24:51	No Cutler-comma-Christian.
333	00:24:51	00:24:53	Ring's not his.
334	00:24:53	00:24:55	Never went to college.
335	00:24:55	00:24:57	That part wasn't in his service record.
336	00:24:57	00:24:58	Scroll up.
337	00:24:58	00:25:00	Check the K's.
338	00:25:03	00:25:05	Hmm.
339	00:25:05	00:25:07	Hold it.
340	00:25:07	00:25:09	Bingo.
341	00:25:13	00:25:15	The rings belongs to you, Brian.
342	00:25:15	00:25:18	You must have dropped it when you stuffing your buddy's corpse into a barrel.
343	00:25:21	00:25:23	Here's the way this is going to play out.
344	00:25:23	00:25:25	This is the best-case scenario.
345	00:25:25	00:25:26	We arrest you for murder.
346	00:25:26	00:25:30	The, uh, the jury likes your face, and, uh, you get Man One.
347	00:25:30	00:25:37	Then you get to spend the next 15 years staring at your wife and kid through a wire glass window.
348	00:25:37	00:25:39	Maybe if you're lucky, uh...
349	00:25:39	00:25:42	when you get out, you can take her to the prom.
350	00:25:47	00:25:49	She's going to be so proud of you, Daddy.
351	00:25:59	00:26:01	It was an accident.
352	00:26:01	00:26:04	You want a tissue or something?
353	00:26:05	00:26:06	No.
354	00:26:07	00:26:10	Hmm?
355	00:26:11	00:26:13	We were in the shop.
356	00:26:13	00:26:16	Real late, no one else there.
357	00:26:16	00:26:20	I'd made some changes to Smash-n-Burn's program.
358	00:26:20	00:26:22	We were testing them out.
359	00:26:22	00:26:25	Smash was acting... really flaky.
360	00:26:25	00:26:28	Sluggish, and then...
361	00:26:30	00:26:34	It just went crazy.
362	00:26:34	00:26:36	With all that blood.
363	00:26:36	00:26:38	And... Chris...
364	00:26:38	00:26:41	in the middle of it just lying there.
365	00:26:41	00:26:44	I had to make it go away.
366	00:26:45	00:26:47	Hey...
367	00:26:48	00:26:50	Hey, Brian.
368	00:26:50	00:26:52	If it was an accident, why didn't you report it?
369	00:26:52	00:26:55	It was my fault.
370	00:26:55	00:26:57	I was... I was so scared.
371	00:26:57	00:26:59	You disposed of the body.
372	00:26:59	00:27:04	Cleaned up the scene, dismantled the bot, and sold the parts.
373	00:27:04	00:27:08	All I could think about was my wife, and my little girl.
374	00:27:08	00:27:09	My little girl.
375	00:27:09	00:27:12	I didn't want to lose them.
376	00:27:12	00:27:13	You got to believe me.
377	00:27:14	00:27:15	It was an accident.
378	00:27:16	00:27:17	I'm so sorry.
379	00:27:19	00:27:22	I'm so sorry.
380	00:27:22	00:27:24	The bank flagged Keith Mercer's ATM card.
381	00:27:24	00:27:25	Really?
382	00:27:25	00:27:27	Somebody tried to use it.
383	00:27:28	00:27:29	I guess the machine ate it, huh?
384	00:27:29	00:27:32	Yeah, but we got the stomach contents.
385	00:27:32	00:27:34	Wicked.
386	00:28:28	00:28:32	You're not Keith Mercer, but you have been using his credit cards.
387	00:28:32	00:28:33	Do you care to tell us about that?
388	00:28:33	00:28:36	He lent me his stuff, told me to have a good time.
389	00:28:36	00:28:39	When did he tell you this?
390	00:28:39	00:28:40	Yesterday.
391	00:28:40	00:28:41	Yesterday?
392	00:28:41	00:28:42	Mm-hmm.
393	00:28:42	00:28:45	Mr. Mercer's been in the morgue for ten days.
394	00:28:45	00:28:47	So unless you were at a seance.
395	00:28:47	00:28:49	I found him. Uh...
396	00:28:49	00:28:51	Did you find that suit there as well?
397	00:28:51	00:28:52	No. I-I bought the suit.
398	00:28:52	00:28:55	With this credit card?
399	00:28:56	00:28:57	No. Um...
400	00:28:58	00:29:00	I used this one.
401	00:29:00	00:29:01	It's not a platinum.
402	00:29:01	00:29:03	It's a... it's a gold.
403	00:29:12	00:29:16	So these are Willy Reddington's original gear.
404	00:29:16	00:29:17	This guy was classy.
405	00:29:17	00:29:21	He goes into a store, buys new clothes, and leaves the old ones behind.
406	00:29:21	00:29:23	And they tossed them in the Dumpster.
407	00:29:23	00:29:25	I wish these people would start checking IDs.
408	00:29:25	00:29:27	This is Vegas, baby.
409	00:29:27	00:29:28	Anybody gets lucky.
410	00:29:28	00:29:29	So, blood?
411	00:29:29	00:29:30	Not a drop.
412	00:29:33	00:29:35	No blood on his clothing.
413	00:29:36	00:29:38	The shoe treads don't match.
414	00:29:38	00:29:41	And the guy's got no car.
415	00:29:41	00:29:43	Yeah, how do you dump a body with no car?
416	00:29:43	00:29:45	What did he do, drag Mercer down the Strip?
417	00:29:45	00:29:48	And if you're robbing a house, why don't you take more stuff?
418	00:29:48	00:29:49	Everything was still there.
419	00:29:49	00:29:51	Except the coin collection.
420	00:29:53	00:29:56	I think the killer knew what he was going to steal.
421	00:29:56	00:29:59	Smash-n-Burn isn't some cyborg death machine with a mind of its own.
422	00:29:59	00:30:00	Man, you've got to drive them.
423	00:30:01	00:30:04	Well, we proved it couldn't have happened the way that Brian said it did.
424	00:30:04	00:30:05	You may have your killer.
425	00:30:05	00:30:07	Yeah.
426	00:30:54	00:30:56	It's not responding.
427	00:31:02	00:31:06	You've got a transmitter module in the remote and a receiver module in the bot.
428	00:31:06	00:31:07	They work as a pair.
429	00:31:07	00:31:12	Yeah, and in every competition, each team is assigned a different numbered frequency.
430	00:31:12	00:31:16	That way, each driver can control their bot without interfering with anybody else's.
431	00:31:16	00:31:17	Or vice versa.
432	00:31:17	00:31:18	This is Smash-n-Burn's receiver.
433	00:31:19	00:31:21	Yeah, and this is Brian's transmitter.
434	00:31:23	00:31:27	They don't match.
435	00:31:27	00:31:31	Okay, so when Christian died, Brian wasn't controlling the bot.
436	00:31:31	00:31:32	Somebody was.
437	00:31:37	00:31:39	Brian claims the bot malfunctioned.
438	00:31:39	00:31:40	Well, we know it didn't.
439	00:31:40	00:31:43	It was responding to a different control frequency.
440	00:31:43	00:31:44	I don't think he knew that.
441	00:31:44	00:31:46	If he did, he was protecting somebody.
442	00:31:46	00:31:47	Hey, boss.
443	00:31:47	00:31:53	Um, I wasn't able to pull any DNA off your vic's personal effects but I did find something else.
444	00:31:53	00:31:55	Uh, those yellow spots on his belt...
445	00:31:55	00:31:56	I ran them through the GCMS.
446	00:31:56	00:31:58	You ran it?
447	00:31:58	00:31:59	Yeah.
448	00:31:59	00:32:00	They're sulfur.
449	00:32:00	00:32:04	Now, Warrick mentioned something about a missing coin collection.
450	00:32:04	00:32:09	Now, some dealers-- bad ones-- use sulfur to polish up coins for sale.
451	00:32:10	00:32:12	Shake and bake.
452	00:32:17	00:32:22	So I figure that your killer is either a coin dealer or a collector.
453	00:32:22	00:32:25	And he transferred the sulfur to the body when disposing of it.
454	00:32:25	00:32:27	Are you a numismatist, Greg?
455	00:32:27	00:32:30	Oh, my grandpa started me off with a 1909 V.D.B.
456	00:32:30	00:32:32	S Lincoln penny.
457	00:32:32	00:32:33	Often referred to as a V.D.B.
458	00:32:33	00:32:37	because it bears the monogram of its engraver, Victor D. Brenner.
459	00:32:37	00:32:38	It's a low mintage.
460	00:32:39	00:32:42	So, let's see, you surf, you scuba dive, you're into latex...
461	00:32:42	00:32:45	you like fashion models and Marilyn Manson.
462	00:32:45	00:32:48	And you also have a coin collection.
463	00:32:48	00:32:49	Weird, huh?
464	00:32:49	00:32:52	Well...
465	00:32:52	00:32:54	I raise cockroaches.
466	00:32:57	00:32:59	Look available.
467	00:32:59	00:33:00	Be unobtainable.
468	00:33:01	00:33:03	Except when you're trying to beat a murder rap.
469	00:33:03	00:33:04	Excuse me?
470	00:33:04	00:33:05	Whatever you did worked.
471	00:33:05	00:33:07	Brian's going down for you.
472	00:33:07	00:33:09	Oh, so, first you accuse me of whacking Christian.
473	00:33:09	00:33:11	Now you're accusing me of doing Brian?
474	00:33:12	00:33:13	Well, you are the queen bee.
475	00:33:14	00:33:16	The drones line up to service you.
476	00:33:16	00:33:19	What the drones do is make bots and break bots.
477	00:33:19	00:33:23	And while they're up wiring and soldering all night long, you know where I am?
478	00:33:23	00:33:25	I'm at home.
479	00:33:26	00:33:28	With this.
480	00:33:28	00:33:32	Does it have a name or did it come with the wallet?
481	00:33:32	00:33:35	Pretty funny for a scientist.
482	00:33:35	00:33:37	Let me make it easy for you.
483	00:33:37	00:33:43	And in case you can't spell, that E-S-Q means he and his entire law firm are going to be all over your ass.
484	00:33:43	00:33:47	Next time you want to talk to me, talk to him.
485	00:33:54	00:33:57	Hey, I was able to pull the cell phone records for our vic.
486	00:33:57	00:34:00	Most of the calls went to the office, two went to the wife.
487	00:34:00	00:34:02	But there are two who are interesting.
488	00:34:02	00:34:03	Jones Collectibles.
489	00:34:03	00:34:06	Guy is a small-time fence.
490	00:34:06	00:34:08	That mean anything to you?
491	00:34:15	00:34:17	Does now.
492	00:34:24	00:34:26	Anything I can help you with, let me know.
493	00:34:33	00:34:34	I heard that you dealt in coins.
494	00:34:35	00:34:36	Really?
495	00:34:36	00:34:38	From whom?
496	00:34:38	00:34:39	Grissom.
497	00:34:40	00:34:41	He's a friend of mine.
498	00:34:42	00:34:43	We work together.
499	00:34:44	00:34:46	Uh, looking to see what you got.
500	00:34:46	00:34:48	I'd like to make a trade.
501	00:34:50	00:34:51	Why the flip?
502	00:34:51	00:34:54	I've been meaning to get it slabbed.
503	00:34:58	00:35:00	Not bad.
504	00:35:00	00:35:01	No hairlines.
505	00:35:01	00:35:04	No fly specks.
506	00:35:05	00:35:08	You got yourself a slider.
507	00:35:09	00:35:12	I'd like to get myself a 1916 D dime.
508	00:35:12	00:35:16	Been all over Vegas, can't find one.
509	00:35:16	00:35:17	You got any?
510	00:35:18	00:35:20	I might have one, but it's pricey.
511	00:35:20	00:35:23	Hey, so is mine.
512	00:35:44	00:35:51	1907 Saint Goddins double eagle gold piece.
513	00:35:51	00:35:53	I've only seen that in books.
514	00:35:53	00:35:55	And that's as close as you get.
515	00:35:55	00:35:57	If you want to deal for the D dime, it's yours.
516	00:35:57	00:36:00	I'll take it.
517	00:36:11	00:36:17	The bot was on a different control frequency, which means someone was using a different transmitter.
518	00:36:17	00:36:18	Puppet master.
519	00:36:18	00:36:20	Somebody else pulling the strings.
520	00:36:20	00:36:23	That would explain why the bot was sluggish.
521	00:36:29	00:36:31	So, what's the range of those controllers anyway?
522	00:36:31	00:36:32	It's limited.
523	00:36:32	00:36:34	Definitely not outside this building.
524	00:36:34	00:36:39	So, if somebody hijacked Brian's bot they'd have to be nearby, but... obviously, out of sight.
525	00:36:43	00:36:45	Well, there's a good place to hide up there.
526	00:36:45	00:36:47	Opportunity.
527	00:36:50	00:36:51	Maybe we've got motive.
528	00:36:54	00:36:56	Ooh, proud papa.
529	00:36:56	00:36:59	The man who built Hammer of God.
530	00:37:00	00:37:03	Which leaves us with... means.
531	00:37:05	00:37:07	Transmitter modules.
532	00:37:16	00:37:18	Yeah, check out the 80s.
533	00:37:18	00:37:23	81, 82, 83... 85, 86?
534	00:37:23	00:37:25	84.
535	00:37:27	00:37:28	I bet I know who's got it.
536	00:37:32	00:37:35	Guy came in a couple of weeks ago with this collection looking to sell.
537	00:37:35	00:37:35	I bought it.
538	00:37:35	00:37:38	There must be $50,000 worth of coins in there, isn't there, Greg?
539	00:37:40	00:37:42	At least.
540	00:37:42	00:37:44	You must have a record of the transaction.
541	00:37:44	00:37:46	I know I got it somewhere.
542	00:37:46	00:37:47	Maybe it's in your car.
543	00:37:47	00:37:48	Mind if we help you look?
544	00:37:48	00:37:50	No, go ahead.
545	00:37:50	00:37:52	I got nothing to hide. ( tosses keys )
546	00:37:58	00:38:00	Ten-inch subs.
547	00:38:00	00:38:02	400 watts.
548	00:38:02	00:38:04	Four channels?
549	00:38:04	00:38:05	That's state-of-the-art.
550	00:38:05	00:38:06	Those hot, too?
551	00:38:06	00:38:09	It kind of looks like the DeLorean from Back to the Future.
552	00:38:11	00:38:12	Trace amounts of sulfur.
553	00:38:12	00:38:15	You don't artificially tone your coins, do you, Mr. Jones?
554	00:38:15	00:38:17	Hey, my merchandise is authentic.
555	00:38:19	00:38:23	Well, you may have some authentic blood in your car as well.
556	00:38:27	00:38:30	Yeah, well, I cut my finger the other day.
557	00:38:30	00:38:31	Huh.
558	00:38:31	00:38:33	That's Keith Mercer's blood.
559	00:38:33	00:38:37	You know it and when I get back to the lab, I'm going to prove it.
560	00:38:37	00:38:40	I think you're busted.
561	00:38:49	00:38:52	So... what happened?
562	00:38:52	00:38:54	I lost.
563	00:38:54	00:38:56	You didn't lose.
564	00:38:56	00:38:57	You were destroyed.
565	00:39:06	00:39:07	Ooh!
566	00:39:19	00:39:22	And you wanted revenge.
567	00:39:22	00:39:25	You couldn't kill Christian's bot so you killed Christian.
568	00:39:25	00:39:27	I heard Brian killed him.
569	00:39:27	00:39:31	This is the transmitter from Christian's robot.
570	00:39:31	00:39:32	So?
571	00:39:33	00:39:35	So... it's got your DNA on it.
572	00:39:47	00:39:49	Brian wasn't in control of the bot.
573	00:39:49	00:39:50	You were.
574	00:40:01	00:40:02	Oh, my God!
575	00:40:02	00:40:04	I can't turn it off!
576	00:40:18	00:40:20	The bot wasn't the only thing you manipulated, Luke.
577	00:40:20	00:40:22	Chris! Chris!
578	00:40:23	00:40:24	Oh, my God.
579	00:40:24	00:40:25	What did you do?!
580	00:40:26	00:40:27	It was an accident.
581	00:40:27	00:40:28	The bot just... Oh, my God!
582	00:40:28	00:40:29	Oh, we've got to call the cops!
583	00:40:30	00:40:32	If you do that, they're going to think you did this. I didn't do it.
584	00:40:32	00:40:34	They're going to put you in prison for life.
585	00:40:34	00:40:37	I'll keep this quiet, but you have to get rid of this body.
586	00:40:43	00:40:45	Brian gave you up.
587	00:40:45	00:40:48	No place to hide now.
588	00:40:57	00:41:00	I know what it must've been like for you.
589	00:41:00	00:41:06	Having created something, only to lose it.
590	00:41:06	00:41:08	Let me guess.
591	00:41:08	00:41:10	You have a kid?
592	00:41:10	00:41:12	Yes, I have a daughter.
593	00:41:12	00:41:17	And you think just because you squeeze a baby out from between your legs, you know how I feel?
594	00:41:19	00:41:20	That's biology.
595	00:41:20	00:41:22	Any animal can do that.
596	00:41:23	00:41:25	Uh-huh.
597	00:41:25	00:41:31	But I took a thought from my head and I made it real.
598	00:41:31	00:41:34	It was... perfect.
599	00:41:36	00:41:41	I guess the only flaw then was you.
600	00:41:49	00:41:50	How's it look?
601	00:41:51	00:41:53	Oh.
602	00:41:53	00:41:54	Blood in the car is the victim's.
603	00:42:00	00:42:01	Keith Mercer made a bad call.
604	00:42:02	00:42:03	Yeah, it sounds like a pretty nice collection.
605	00:42:03	00:42:06	How about I come by Saturday and take a look?
606	00:42:06	00:42:07	Uh, this weekend's no good.
607	00:42:07	00:42:08	My wife and I are out of town.
608	00:42:08	00:42:11	Hey, what are you doing?
609	00:42:13	00:42:15	Told you that dude was busted.
610	00:42:15	00:42:17	What happened to your enthusiasm, Greg?
611	00:42:20	00:42:26	Well... every time I make another DNA match in here, my world gets a little smaller.
612	00:42:26	00:42:29	Out there... felt large.
613	00:42:29	00:42:32	Out there means a pay cut.
614	00:42:33	00:42:35	I'm not about the money.
615	00:42:40	00:42:41	That's good to know.
