0	00:00:31	00:00:32	Maggots.
1	00:00:32	00:00:34	This kid's been here a while.
2	00:00:42	00:00:45	No gunshot wounds.
3	00:00:45	00:00:46	No stab marks.
4	00:00:46	00:00:48	No signs of strangulation.
5	00:00:48	00:00:51	It's a long way out in the sticks just to drop dead.
6	00:00:55	00:00:57	Not if you're being chased.
7	00:00:59	00:01:02	Look at the foot patterns leading up to the body.
8	00:01:02	00:01:04	See the strides?
9	00:01:04	00:01:08	This kid was running.
10	00:01:08	00:01:10	See the left foot impression?
11	00:01:10	00:01:11	It's straight; that's normal.
12	00:01:11	00:01:15	But look at the right foot impression.
13	00:01:15	00:01:17	It's turned outward.
14	00:01:17	00:01:18	Almost 90 degrees.
15	00:01:19	00:01:21	He was looking over his shoulder when he was running.
16	00:01:21	00:01:23	Think there was somebody else here?
17	00:01:26	00:01:29	Based on these prints, it's hard to tell.
18	00:01:29	00:01:32	Can I get this taped off here?
19	00:01:34	00:01:35	So you want to call it?
20	00:01:35	00:01:38	How do you think he died?
21	00:01:41	00:01:44	Fear.
22	00:01:44	00:01:48	Someone chased this kid to death.
23	00:02:38	00:02:40	Grissom.
24	00:02:40	00:02:43	No. No, I did it yesterday.
25	00:02:43	00:02:46	Yes, I did.
26	00:02:46	00:02:47	Thank you.
27	00:02:47	00:02:51	Hey, you want to give us our assignments or do you want us to take... the night off?
28	00:02:51	00:02:58	Paperwork, paper clips, paper-punchers-- all these people want me to do is push paper; nobody wants me to solve crimes.
29	00:02:58	00:03:00	Hey, you could've turned the job down.
30	00:03:00	00:03:04	Yeah, the grass is always greener, Catherine.
31	00:03:04	00:03:06	Well let's just hurry this up.
32	00:03:09	00:03:10	Cool.
33	00:03:10	00:03:12	You really want to see flash paper flash?
34	00:03:12	00:03:14	Walk in on a bookie.
35	00:03:14	00:03:16	That's what this was about, bookies.
36	00:03:18	00:03:20	Don't answer it.
37	00:03:20	00:03:23	We've got work to do... Boss.
38	00:03:26	00:03:29	Warrick, you and I are on the 419 our dead body in the desert.
39	00:03:29	00:03:31	Sara, dead body of your own. Dumpsite out near Henderson.
40	00:03:32	00:03:33	Oh, I'll dress down.
41	00:03:33	00:03:35	Catherine, Verbum Dei Charter School. 420 homicide.
42	00:03:36	00:03:38	The school dean was killed in his office.
43	00:03:38	00:03:40	Suspect called it in; could be self-defense.
44	00:03:40	00:03:42	Did some kid off him with a silver spoon?
45	00:03:42	00:03:43	Suspect's not a kid.
46	00:03:43	00:03:45	It's the woman who founded the school.
47	00:03:45	00:03:47	Take Nicky with you.
48	00:03:47	00:03:48	Where is he?
49	00:03:48	00:03:50	Here I am.
50	00:03:50	00:03:51	You're coming with me.
51	00:03:51	00:03:52	Glad you could make it.
52	00:03:52	00:03:54	I'm outta here. Good luck tonight, you guys.
53	00:03:54	00:03:55	See you.
54	00:03:55	00:03:57	Can't make a ruling?
55	00:03:57	00:03:59	Look at the bruise marks on John Doe here.
56	00:03:59	00:04:01	I call that suffocation.
57	00:04:01	00:04:02	Not necessarily.
58	00:04:02	00:04:07	It could be the result of his face impacting the ground at expiration.
59	00:04:07	00:04:08	I'm going to take a mouth swab.
60	00:04:08	00:04:09	Go ahead.
61	00:04:09	00:04:11	Grissom, I have something to show you.
62	00:04:11	00:04:17	You know, when a kid this young drops dead smart money chases anesthetics, alcohol methanol, maybe even a little Freon.
63	00:04:17	00:04:19	I've got to be honest.
64	00:04:19	00:04:25	I've had a lot of dead bodies from the desert and when they're out there too long the elements tend to eat away the evidence.
65	00:04:25	00:04:27	My opinion is, you are looking at the picture of health, internally.
66	00:04:27	00:04:31	Externally, it's another matter.
67	00:04:31	00:04:34	Skin sample.
68	00:04:37	00:04:38	This kid was dry as a bone.
69	00:04:38	00:04:41	From exposure?
70	00:04:41	00:04:43	The skin's not consistent with elemental damage.
71	00:04:43	00:04:47	Warrick told me what you said about the cause of death being fear.
72	00:04:47	00:04:49	I never read about that in any medical book.
73	00:04:50	00:04:51	Try the Forensic Medical Journal.
74	00:04:54	00:04:56	Homicide, suicide, natural, and unexplained.
75	00:04:56	00:05:00	Talks about fear in the last part of unexplained.
76	00:05:00	00:05:01	I had to ask.
77	00:05:01	00:05:03	You want to know what killed this kid?
78	00:05:03	00:05:04	Benihana the maggots.
79	00:05:04	00:05:05	What the maggots?
80	00:05:06	00:05:08	Tox the maggots we found on the victim.
81	00:05:08	00:05:11	Whatever he ingested has probably evaporated from the sun.
82	00:05:11	00:05:14	But the maggots are like little refrigerators.
83	00:05:14	00:05:17	They preserve what we digest for longer periods of time.
84	00:05:17	00:05:19	Entomology is our friend.
85	00:05:19	00:05:21	Yes.
86	00:05:25	00:05:28	Sorry, little buddy.
87	00:05:29	00:05:31	Scalpel.
88	00:05:31	00:05:34	My name is Paul and this is between y'all.
89	00:05:35	00:05:36	Talk about Pulp Fiction.
90	00:05:41	00:05:43	It's all yours, Doc.
91	00:05:46	00:05:50	Fire up that gas chromatograph mass spectrometer thing, will you?
92	00:05:50	00:05:53	No problem, son.
93	00:05:59	00:06:01	15 seconds till pay dirt.
94	00:06:01	00:06:02	Cool.
95	00:06:02	00:06:04	Play any pigskin, man?
96	00:06:04	00:06:05	No, I'm off that.
97	00:06:05	00:06:07	It's prime time for you.
98	00:06:07	00:06:09	I haven't made a bet in a month.
99	00:06:09	00:06:11	I can't say I don't have that itch, though.
100	00:06:15	00:06:17	Hmm. Haven't seen this stuff for a while.
101	00:06:18	00:06:19	What's that?
102	00:06:19	00:06:20	Jimsonweed.
103	00:06:33	00:06:35	Do you have a name?
104	00:06:36	00:06:38	She's not exactly carrying a purse.
105	00:06:41	00:06:42	Oh...
106	00:06:51	00:06:53	Okay, let's take her out.
107	00:06:56	00:06:58	Thanks.
108	00:06:58	00:06:59	Sure.
109	00:07:07	00:07:10	That's strange.
110	00:07:10	00:07:12	What's that?
111	00:07:12	00:07:14	Glazed like a doughnut.
112	00:07:16	00:07:18	Well, here's the reason the skin was funny.
113	00:07:18	00:07:19	Formaldehyde, right?
114	00:07:19	00:07:20	Close. BioTone Arterial.
115	00:07:21	00:07:24	Promotes high diffusion and fast drainage in skin tissue.
116	00:07:24	00:07:26	So I was right. This woman's been embalmed.
117	00:07:26	00:07:33	Yeah. Yeah, I already ran her prints through work-hire; got her I.D. right here.
118	00:07:33	00:07:35	I, uh, I just want to say I-I...
119	00:07:35	00:07:38	Well, I really admire the gusto with which you approach your job.
120	00:07:38	00:07:41	Are you hitting on me, David?
121	00:07:44	00:07:45	Uh...
122	00:07:48	00:07:49	Let me give you some friendly advice.
123	00:07:50	00:07:52	If you want to pull chicks, you've got to get aggressive.
124	00:07:52	00:07:57	You've gotta drop the glasses lose the coat grow some scruff.
125	00:07:59	00:08:03	You do get a C for cute, though.
126	00:08:10	00:08:14	Stephanie Reyes was laid to rest at Desert Haven Funeral Home.
127	00:08:14	00:08:17	Her funeral was last week.
128	00:08:23	00:08:25	Hi.
129	00:08:25	00:08:26	Hey.
130	00:08:26	00:08:27	What do you got?
131	00:08:27	00:08:31	Vernon Woods, dean of the school.
132	00:08:31	00:08:36	39, single. Multiple blunt-force trauma wounds to the head.
133	00:08:36	00:08:37	With that, probably.
134	00:08:37	00:08:39	I got it.
135	00:08:40	00:08:43	Man, check out all that blood spatter.
136	00:08:45	00:08:49	Yeah, blows to the head, up close and personal.
137	00:08:49	00:08:51	A lot of passion around this one.
138	00:08:51	00:08:53	Any suspects?
139	00:08:54	00:08:56	Kate Armstrong. Founded the school.
140	00:08:56	00:09:00	She called 911 herself. She says he attacked her.
141	00:09:00	00:09:02	She's out in the hallway.
142	00:09:08	00:09:10	He wouldn't let go of me.
143	00:09:10	00:09:11	He kept pawing.
144	00:09:11	00:09:13	I can still smell his aftershave.
145	00:09:13	00:09:16	I mean...
146	00:09:16	00:09:18	It's all a blur.
147	00:09:18	00:09:21	I grabbed the closest thing I could and I hit him with it.
148	00:09:21	00:09:23	A rock?
149	00:09:23	00:09:25	I don't know what it was.
150	00:09:25	00:09:27	I didn't care. I just wanted him off of me.
151	00:09:27	00:09:28	How many times did you hit him?
152	00:09:28	00:09:30	Once.
153	00:09:32	00:09:34	What's the matter?
154	00:09:34	00:09:36	Come on. No one's going to hear.
155	00:09:36	00:09:38	Everyone's in class. Where's the harm?
156	00:09:38	00:09:40	I said get off of me!
157	00:09:40	00:09:43	Miss Armstrong...
158	00:09:43	00:09:46	were you and the dean having a personal relationship?
159	00:09:46	00:09:48	No.
160	00:09:48	00:09:50	No, Vernon's a pig.
161	00:09:50	00:09:52	Then why did you hire him?
162	00:09:53	00:09:54	You founded the school.
163	00:09:54	00:09:57	It's your integrity on the line.
164	00:09:57	00:09:59	He's great at raising money.
165	00:09:59	00:10:02	His donor list is huge.
166	00:10:03	00:10:06	I didn't mean to kill him.
167	00:10:08	00:10:12	I just wanted him to leave me alone.
168	00:10:12	00:10:14	But you hit him more than once.
169	00:10:14	00:10:17	Oh, who knows. I...
170	00:10:17	00:10:19	Well, you hit a man once, there's no blood.
171	00:10:19	00:10:21	The first hit's free.
172	00:10:21	00:10:22	You hit him more than that...
173	00:10:24	00:10:28	The walls in his office look like the dean went a couple rounds with Mike Tyson.
174	00:10:28	00:10:31	Then I hit him more than once.
175	00:10:31	00:10:34	Like I said, I just...
176	00:10:34	00:10:38	I wanted him off me.
177	00:10:38	00:10:41	Will you excuse me?
178	00:10:41	00:10:44	Officer. Thanks.
179	00:10:46	00:10:48	What'd you find out?
180	00:10:48	00:10:50	Heavy on B.S.; zippo on truth.
181	00:10:50	00:10:52	You don't seem too bummed about it.
182	00:10:52	00:10:53	Hell, no, I'm stoked.
183	00:10:53	00:10:55	We drew the best case, Nicky.
184	00:10:55	00:10:57	I can feel it.
185	00:10:57	00:10:58	Mm-hmm.
186	00:10:58	00:11:00	Then there's only one thing left to do.
187	00:11:00	00:11:01	String it.
188	00:11:01	00:11:03	String it.
189	00:11:03	00:11:05	I've never filed a missing person's report before.
190	00:11:05	00:11:07	But I'm getting concerned about Eric.
191	00:11:07	00:11:11	Where was the last place you saw your friend?
192	00:11:11	00:11:12	After work, we went out.
193	00:11:12	00:11:13	You two work together?
194	00:11:13	00:11:14	No, a few blocks apart.
195	00:11:14	00:11:16	I'm over at Voosh's, you know?
196	00:11:16	00:11:20	Voosh's Fireworks and he's at Element Sound, the music store.
197	00:11:21	00:11:22	You guys go into the desert?
198	00:11:22	00:11:24	Yeah, a party out near Red Rock.
199	00:11:24	00:11:25	How'd you know?
200	00:11:26	00:11:27	You just told us.
201	00:11:29	00:11:30	So spill it.
202	00:11:31	00:11:36	We, uh, drank a couple beers hung out, and...
203	00:11:36	00:11:41	then I just lost track of him around midnight and I haven't seen him since.
204	00:11:41	00:11:43	Did you guys drop anything that night?
205	00:11:43	00:11:44	Ecstasy, crystal, G...?
206	00:11:44	00:11:45	No.
207	00:11:45	00:11:47	No way.
208	00:11:47	00:11:51	Look, do you, do you know where Eric is or not?
209	00:11:51	00:11:57	Bobby, we found a body that matches your description of Eric.
210	00:11:57	00:12:01	Would you be willing to identify him?
211	00:12:01	00:12:03	Is this your friend?
212	00:12:13	00:12:16	Oh, God...
213	00:12:18	00:12:21	What happened to you, Eric?
214	00:12:21	00:12:23	Oh, God...
215	00:12:26	00:12:28	Hey, boss. I got something for you.
216	00:12:34	00:12:38	I did this whole tox-the-maggots thing like you said.
217	00:12:38	00:12:40	Found jimsonweed in their blood.
218	00:12:40	00:12:42	Which means?
219	00:12:42	00:12:44	Jimsonweed in Eric's blood.
220	00:12:44	00:12:45	Jimsonweed.
221	00:12:45	00:12:51	Dry as a bone, red as a beet blind as a bat, mad as a hatter.
222	00:12:51	00:12:54	Really? Cite your sources.
223	00:12:54	00:12:57	Internet insomnia.
224	00:12:57	00:13:00	But Brass just said they weren't doing any drugs.
225	00:13:01	00:13:02	Yeah.
226	00:14:02	00:14:05	Blood spatter on northwest wall.
227	00:14:05	00:14:09	Blood sprays northeast corner above...
228	00:14:11	00:14:14	Wow.
229	00:14:16	00:14:18	Now, there's a look I like to see-- confusion.
230	00:14:20	00:14:22	No, I'm not confused.
231	00:14:22	00:14:23	X marks the spot.
232	00:14:23	00:14:24	A blow here...
233	00:14:24	00:14:27	here... and here.
234	00:14:27	00:14:31	Our dean received the majority of blows when he was on the ground.
235	00:14:31	00:14:33	Cast-off from the weapon against the window. Mm-hmm.
236	00:14:33	00:14:36	The back wall...
237	00:14:37	00:14:40	Void... against the back wall.
238	00:14:42	00:14:44	The floor under the body?
239	00:14:45	00:14:48	The blood spatter has a void instead of one continuous line of spray.
240	00:14:48	00:14:55	There's an interruption a space where something or someone comes between the blood coming off the body and the wall.
241	00:14:55	00:14:57	Which means our assailant was here and...
242	00:14:57	00:15:01	There was somebody else in this room.
243	00:15:01	00:15:03	Kate Armstrong is lying.
244	00:15:03	00:15:07	Fruit juice, half ice.
245	00:15:07	00:15:09	Thanks, Warrick.
246	00:15:09	00:15:13	The guy said it was natural, that it wasn't a drug.
247	00:15:13	00:15:16	I mean, jimsonweed is a plant.
248	00:15:16	00:15:19	Most drugs derive from plants.
249	00:15:19	00:15:20	That doesn't make them safe.
250	00:15:20	00:15:22	Or legal, for that matter.
251	00:15:22	00:15:24	Yeah, but he said it was safe.
252	00:15:24	00:15:25	That's why we bought it.
253	00:15:25	00:15:27	Did you take the drug, too?
254	00:15:27	00:15:31	Yeah. We both did.
255	00:15:31	00:15:34	You drink it. It's a tea.
256	00:15:34	00:15:36	Who sold you this tea?
257	00:15:36	00:15:39	He didn't give a name.
258	00:15:39	00:15:40	He just...
259	00:15:40	00:15:43	He told us that j-weed would be a cool high.
260	00:15:43	00:15:45	Mind-expanding.
261	00:15:45	00:15:49	I mean, that's the whole point of a rave is to experiment.
262	00:15:49	00:15:52	Did you get a stamp when you got in?
263	00:15:52	00:15:54	Yeah. But that was like four days ago.
264	00:15:54	00:15:58	Well, mostly they use water-resistant pads so you don't sweat it off.
265	00:15:58	00:16:00	Could you hit the lights, Gris?
266	00:16:02	00:16:04	Where'd they stamp you?
267	00:16:06	00:16:08	Yeah, that's DJMasterband's stamp.
268	00:16:08	00:16:11	He is the spinner in Vegas right now.
269	00:16:11	00:16:15	Must've been playing at the rave these two were at.
270	00:16:16	00:16:19	Is there any way for us to track this, uh, DJ person?
271	00:16:19	00:16:21	The free papers, yeah.
272	00:16:21	00:16:23	They have ads for all sorts of raves.
273	00:16:23	00:16:24	Bobby?
274	00:16:24	00:16:27	Would you be able to recognize the guy who sold you the jimson?
275	00:16:27	00:16:30	Definitely.
276	00:16:33	00:16:39	No one in the mortuary business likes to discuss the issue people rob graves.
277	00:16:39	00:16:43	Are you telling me that someone dug up Stephanie Reyes and stole her body?
278	00:16:43	00:16:46	They do it for gold, trinkets, or just kicks.
279	00:16:46	00:16:48	You should hear what I hear at conventions.
280	00:16:49	00:16:53	Did you report the robbery of Mrs. Reyes' remains to the police?
281	00:16:53	00:16:57	As I say, we try not to discuss the issue outside of the community.
282	00:16:57	00:17:01	Profits over people, is that it?
283	00:17:01	00:17:03	I wouldn't put it like that.
284	00:17:15	00:17:17	Eight feet.
285	00:17:17	00:17:19	How deep do you bury these caskets?
286	00:17:19	00:17:21	Well...
287	00:17:21	00:17:22	There's nothing else in there.
288	00:17:22	00:17:26	I thought you said grave robbers only stole bodies.
289	00:17:26	00:17:33	This might've been an inlaid casket something of value that people would steal.
290	00:17:33	00:17:35	You sell caskets, right?
291	00:17:35	00:17:37	As part of your mortuary service?
292	00:17:37	00:17:39	I want to see some.
293	00:17:39	00:17:42	I can arrange a viewing.
294	00:17:42	00:17:45	Bonus.
295	00:17:55	00:18:01	Gris, I got the prelims back on that swab I took off of our desert guy.
296	00:18:01	00:18:02	And?
297	00:18:06	00:18:10	mentholated nose spray, patchouli and aluminum.
298	00:18:10	00:18:11	Nose spray? He had a cold.
299	00:18:11	00:18:13	Patchouli-- they burn it at music stores.
300	00:18:13	00:18:15	Aluminum's the odd man out.
301	00:18:15	00:18:18	Yeah. I got Trace putting together a list of products made with the stuff.
302	00:18:18	00:18:21	Something tells me it's not lemonade.
303	00:18:21	00:18:23	Jimson tea.
304	00:18:23	00:18:25	I like to see what I'm dealing with.
305	00:18:25	00:18:27	Doesn't look lethal, does it?
306	00:18:27	00:18:28	Doesn't look like tea, either.
307	00:18:28	00:18:31	You know what the Japanese tea ceremony signifies?
308	00:18:31	00:18:32	What's that?
309	00:18:32	00:18:38	That every human encounter is a singular occasion which can never recur again in exactly the same way.
310	00:18:38	00:18:40	Does that apply to our case?
311	00:18:40	00:18:43	Everything applies, Warrick.
312	00:18:43	00:18:46	That's the beauty part.
313	00:18:46	00:18:49	Cheers.
314	00:18:51	00:18:53	All right, it's true.
315	00:18:53	00:18:54	Someone else was there.
316	00:18:54	00:18:56	A name would be nice.
317	00:18:56	00:19:00	She's a friend on the faculty but she had nothing to do with this.
318	00:19:00	00:19:02	The blood evidence is telling us otherwise.
319	00:19:02	00:19:05	Look, homicide will give us her name if you won't.
320	00:19:05	00:19:07	There are detectives, and your school's not that big.
321	00:19:07	00:19:12	Julia Eastman, but she was doing me a favor.
322	00:19:12	00:19:15	She was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.
323	00:19:17	00:19:23	We kind of made a plan so that the next time Woods hit on her she'd have a witness.
324	00:19:23	00:19:25	You know, because of the harassment.
325	00:19:25	00:19:27	When you were playing witness, where were you standing?
326	00:19:28	00:19:30	At the doorway.
327	00:19:30	00:19:31	You're sure?
328	00:19:31	00:19:33	Yeah.
329	00:19:34	00:19:36	I know you want it. Give us a little...
330	00:19:40	00:19:42	Why you...
331	00:19:42	00:19:43	( grunt ) Ah!
332	00:19:47	00:19:50	We're forensic scientists, Julia.
333	00:19:50	00:19:51	Blood talks to us.
334	00:19:51	00:19:54	People exaggerate or forget.
335	00:19:54	00:19:56	Blood's like my grandfather. Never lies.
336	00:19:56	00:20:00	Nick reenacted the crime using blood spatter.
337	00:20:00	00:20:03	No, I just strung it, but thank you anyway.
338	00:20:03	00:20:06	No, the computer gizmo does all the geometry.
339	00:20:06	00:20:13	You factor in the location of the body in relation to the blood on the wall in order to create an equation that recreates the event.
340	00:20:13	00:20:18	Each hit that drew blood gets its own unique color as he fell.
341	00:20:18	00:20:19	See?
342	00:20:19	00:20:20	Dean Woods was not in a standing position.
343	00:20:20	00:20:22	When he was killed, he was on the floor.
344	00:20:22	00:20:30	So how could your friend Kate, who's roughly half his size, wrestle him to the ground and keep him there while she bludgeoned him to death?
345	00:20:30	00:20:31	Without help?
346	00:20:31	00:20:34	I don't know.
347	00:20:34	00:20:36	Hmm.
348	00:20:36	00:20:38	Could we take a break?
349	00:20:38	00:20:40	I need a break.
350	00:20:42	00:20:43	Sure.
351	00:21:08	00:21:09	Three.
352	00:21:09	00:21:12	It's gonna be 20 each.
353	00:21:33	00:21:35	Teenage wasteland.
354	00:21:35	00:21:36	Who?
355	00:21:36	00:21:38	Yeah.
356	00:21:41	00:21:44	Hi!
357	00:21:44	00:21:45	Hi.
358	00:21:45	00:21:48	I love you.
359	00:21:49	00:21:52	Uh, thank you.
360	00:21:52	00:21:55	You're a total stranger to me.
361	00:21:55	00:21:56	It's Ecstasy.
362	00:21:56	00:21:58	It makes everyone fall in love.
363	00:21:58	00:22:00	Don't take it personally, miss.
364	00:22:00	00:22:02	He's kind of married to his job.
365	00:22:05	00:22:07	I love you.
366	00:22:11	00:22:13	Come on. Let's go.
367	00:22:28	00:22:31	That's him, there, there!
368	00:22:32	00:22:33	Bobby, wait!
369	00:22:37	00:22:39	You killed my friend!
370	00:22:39	00:22:40	Break it up!
371	00:22:40	00:22:41	Bobby, stop it!
372	00:22:45	00:22:46	Ow...!
373	00:22:49	00:22:51	What do you guys think you got on me?
374	00:22:51	00:22:53	Selling jimsonweed to kids.
375	00:22:53	00:22:55	Do you see any j-weed on me?
376	00:22:55	00:22:59	You sent, uh, Bobby over here and his friend on quite a trip the other night.
377	00:22:59	00:23:00	Which trip was that?
378	00:23:00	00:23:02	The one to San Diego or the one to Mars?
379	00:23:02	00:23:04	To the impound, where your car is going.
380	00:23:04	00:23:06	Probable cause.
381	00:23:06	00:23:08	You don't have to take my car to the impound.
382	00:23:08	00:23:09	You can search it.
383	00:23:09	00:23:10	But, I got news for you.
384	00:23:10	00:23:12	Jimson's an unscheduled controlled substance.
385	00:23:13	00:23:16	Mandatory suspended sentence for the first go-round for possession.
386	00:23:16	00:23:18	And you can't even prove that much.
387	00:23:18	00:23:21	Guy knows a lot about the Nevada state penal code.
388	00:23:21	00:23:23	Well, if you're gonna break the law you've gotta know the law.
389	00:23:23	00:23:25	Exactly.
390	00:23:25	00:23:28	Just don't scratch my puppy.
391	00:24:27	00:24:30	What do you say, Ethan?
392	00:24:30	00:24:31	These seeds look familiar?
393	00:24:33	00:24:35	You just fish those out of your undies?
394	00:24:35	00:24:37	Look, man, if you want to take me in...
395	00:24:37	00:24:38	take me in.
396	00:24:38	00:24:40	I'll be back before the party's over.
397	00:24:40	00:24:41	'Cause you know the law, don't you?
398	00:24:42	00:24:44	Mandatory suspended sentence for the first possession.
399	00:24:44	00:24:45	Exactly.
400	00:24:45	00:24:47	Let me tell you something.
401	00:24:47	00:24:51	You're twice the age of these kids and most of them couldn't find their ass with a map.
402	00:24:51	00:25:01	You prey on innocent children concocting God-knows-what from God-knows-where selling Russian Roulette in a bottle and you think we came all the way out here to bust you for possession, you dumb punk?
403	00:25:05	00:25:07	I'm gonna get you for murder.
404	00:25:09	00:25:11	Cool?
405	00:25:17	00:25:21	This Ethan was selling jimsonweed tea at the desert rave.
406	00:25:21	00:25:26	I believe Eric drank the most toxic part-- the dregs, the bottom of the batch the part that's full of seeds.
407	00:25:26	00:25:35	If that's true, then we might be able to catch up with some of those seeds because they have a way of hanging around the lower intestinal tract.
408	00:25:35	00:25:39	The last ones to leave the party would be right about here.
409	00:25:42	00:25:47	Jimson reduced his gastric motility which kept this in his system.
410	00:25:47	00:25:50	Now we just tie that to the dealer.
411	00:25:50	00:25:52	Well, we see if it ties to the dealer.
412	00:25:52	00:25:55	That's not what you were saying out at that rave all up in that guy's face.
413	00:25:58	00:26:06	Guys that hit their wives, sexual assault on children and the scum that deal death to kids.
414	00:26:08	00:26:11	The chemical compositions break down exactly the same.
415	00:26:11	00:26:17	Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily prove that the seeds from the dead kid's gut came from the same place as the seeds in the dealer's car.
416	00:26:17	00:26:20	We'd need the pods to do a DNA match and we don't have them.
417	00:26:20	00:26:22	The truth is, it wouldn't matter.
418	00:26:22	00:26:23	I ran the seeds Eric ingested.
419	00:26:23	00:26:26	The toxic levels are low too low to have killed him.
420	00:26:26	00:26:28	Square one.
421	00:26:30	00:26:34	There is no way I'm going to end up in a dumpster wrapped in plastic.
422	00:26:34	00:26:38	I'm going to be cremated-- dust in the wind, you know.
423	00:26:38	00:26:40	I don't want any part of these things.
424	00:26:40	00:26:43	I've already got mine paid off.
425	00:26:43	00:26:45	Are you serious?
426	00:26:45	00:26:47	Yeah. It looks just like this one.
427	00:26:49	00:26:51	How much did it run you?
428	00:26:51	00:26:52	Ten thou.
429	00:26:53	00:26:54	$10,000...
430	00:26:54	00:26:58	For a box buried in the ground that everyone's only going to see you in once.
431	00:26:58	00:26:59	I like it.
432	00:27:00	00:27:02	It feels like a Caddie.
433	00:27:02	00:27:08	So when you buy one of these for $10,000, it's yours, right?
434	00:27:08	00:27:10	Well, of course it is.
435	00:27:10	00:27:12	No one else gets to use it.
436	00:27:13	00:27:15	It's built for one.
437	00:27:38	00:27:41	Then how did all these people get in here?
438	00:27:45	00:27:48	Thought I'd find you here.
439	00:27:48	00:27:51	It's why I live.
440	00:27:51	00:27:53	Evidence...
441	00:27:53	00:27:57	the double-edged sword.
442	00:27:57	00:28:00	Yeah, nobody wanted to put that pusher in jail more than I did.
443	00:28:00	00:28:02	The evidence sets him free.
444	00:28:02	00:28:04	How do you feel about this?
445	00:28:04	00:28:07	It doesn't matter how I feel.
446	00:28:07	00:28:10	the truth.
447	00:28:10	00:28:11	It is what it is.
448	00:28:12	00:28:14	You don't really believe that, do you?
449	00:28:15	00:28:19	I was flying to a seminar in New Hampshire a couple summers ago.
450	00:28:19	00:28:23	I was sitting on the plane next to this philosophy professor from Harvard.
451	00:28:23	00:28:28	He told me this story about how every morning he takes a leak right after his three-hour philosophy class.
452	00:28:28	00:28:35	He'd flush the toilet there'd be this tiny, brown spider fighting for its life against the swirling water.
453	00:28:35	00:28:40	Come back the next day, flush same spider clawing its way back from oblivion.
454	00:28:40	00:28:43	A week goes by, he decides to liberate the spider.
455	00:28:44	00:28:49	Grabs a paper towel, scoops him up sets him on the floor in the corner of the stall.
456	00:28:49	00:28:53	Comes back the next day what do you think happened to the spider?
457	00:28:53	00:28:56	Dead.
458	00:28:56	00:28:59	On his back, eight legs in the air. Why?
459	00:29:00	00:29:04	Because one life imposed itself on another.
460	00:29:04	00:29:07	Right then I realized where we stand.
461	00:29:07	00:29:09	I understood our role.
462	00:29:10	00:29:12	We don't impose our will on a spider.
463	00:29:12	00:29:15	We don't impose our hopes on the evidence.
464	00:29:20	00:29:23	Twenty, ten, five, boom!
465	00:29:23	00:29:24	Touchdown, baby.
466	00:29:25	00:29:27	What's my name?
467	00:29:30	00:29:32	You'll be back.
468	00:29:32	00:29:35	Oh, really? What, have you got a crystal ball in your pocket or something?
469	00:29:35	00:29:37	You're a creature of habit.
470	00:29:37	00:29:39	I'll catch you later.
471	00:29:43	00:29:47	Okay, this is what we've got so far on our dead dean.
472	00:29:47	00:29:50	Blood spatter and blood cast-off on the walls.
473	00:29:50	00:29:53	Kate Armstrong's confession, her clothes.
474	00:29:53	00:29:57	Three void areas, and that's pretty much it.
475	00:29:57	00:29:58	Anything else?
476	00:29:58	00:30:00	It's not enough, it's not enough.
477	00:30:00	00:30:02	What's the one thing we're missing?
478	00:30:02	00:30:04	That's it.
479	00:30:04	00:30:05	What's it?
480	00:30:05	00:30:07	The one thing we're missing.
481	00:30:07	00:30:08	The blood.
482	00:30:09	00:30:10	On Julia's clothes.
483	00:30:10	00:30:15	We need the clothes that you were wearing the day that the dean was killed.
484	00:30:15	00:30:18	I burned them.
485	00:30:18	00:30:20	Why?
486	00:30:20	00:30:21	The blood wouldn't come out.
487	00:30:22	00:30:23	They were ruined.
488	00:30:23	00:30:25	Blood's funny that way.
489	00:30:25	00:30:31	In fact, I bet there's plenty of blood on Dean Woods' shirt.
490	00:30:35	00:30:38	Look at that void.
491	00:30:38	00:30:40	What a beaut.
492	00:30:40	00:30:41	Oh, yeah.
493	00:30:41	00:30:46	You don't even have to know every star and you can draw a constellation.
494	00:30:55	00:30:59	And fill in the rest.
495	00:31:01	00:31:05	Whoa, look at that last finger there.
496	00:31:05	00:31:08	Talk about your unique attributes.
497	00:31:08	00:31:10	What do you think, a bandage?
498	00:31:10	00:31:16	We'll have to ask our ladies, but I can tell you this-- somebody's playing through the pain.
499	00:31:16	00:31:19	I, uh...
500	00:31:19	00:31:23	I just wanted you to know that Eric didn't die from jimson tea.
501	00:31:23	00:31:27	It didn't have the chemical toxicity to kill him.
502	00:31:27	00:31:29	The seeds weren't strong enough.
503	00:31:34	00:31:35	Is your arm all right?
504	00:31:35	00:31:37	Yeah, uh, spider bite.
505	00:31:37	00:31:40	I think it's infected.
506	00:31:40	00:31:42	May I take a look?
507	00:31:42	00:31:43	Sure. You're a doctor.
508	00:31:43	00:31:46	You might be able to give me something for it.
509	00:31:46	00:31:48	I'm a Ph.D., not an M.D.
510	00:31:57	00:32:03	Bobby... this bite is not from an insect.
511	00:32:25	00:32:28	Hey. Hi.
512	00:32:30	00:32:36	I found a bite mark on Bobby's arm and I think it might be human.
513	00:32:36	00:32:38	Do you feel like sharing?
514	00:32:38	00:32:39	Not really.
515	00:32:39	00:32:41	Just a little?
516	00:32:43	00:32:45	I don't know, Jenna.
517	00:32:45	00:32:49	This whole case is going from bad to worse.
518	00:32:49	00:32:55	I mean, usually it's a body, it's a specimen but when it involves kids, I just can't...
519	00:32:55	00:32:57	Gruesome Grissom...
520	00:32:57	00:32:59	Tin man with a heart.
521	00:32:59	00:33:01	Who knew?
522	00:33:01	00:33:03	Hey, guys.
523	00:33:03	00:33:09	This came back for the test on aluminum products on our kid in the desert.
524	00:33:09	00:33:12	Fireworks.
525	00:33:12	00:33:14	That's where Bobby Taylor works.
526	00:33:17	00:33:24	Jenna, I need a mold of Eric's teeth and an impression of Bobby's arm.
527	00:33:34	00:33:38	Julia, make a fist for me with your right hand.
528	00:33:38	00:33:40	I mean, count it down like so, starting with your thumb first.
529	00:33:41	00:33:44	Five, four, three, two, one.
530	00:33:58	00:34:01	Sprained it at tennis.
531	00:34:01	00:34:04	It heals a lot faster when you wear one of these.
532	00:34:11	00:34:13	Dean Woods' shirt.
533	00:34:13	00:34:18	Now, remember we said blood tells us everything?
534	00:34:18	00:34:22	Well... so does the absence of blood.
535	00:34:29	00:34:31	Oh, my God.
536	00:34:47	00:34:48	You held him down...
537	00:34:50	00:34:53	while she killed him.
538	00:34:53	00:34:57	All because the guy was handsy?
539	00:35:00	00:35:02	Seems a little severe.
540	00:35:06	00:35:09	We're going to be placing you under arrest for murder.
541	00:35:09	00:35:12	Is there anything you want to say?
542	00:35:31	00:35:33	No, no, this isn't over.
543	00:35:34	00:35:36	For all forensic purposes, it is over.
544	00:35:36	00:35:40	They're going to eat bread and bang a metal cup against some bars.
545	00:35:40	00:35:42	That's it. It's over for us.
546	00:35:42	00:35:43	We still don't know why.
547	00:35:43	00:35:45	It's not our job to know why.
548	00:35:45	00:35:46	It's our job to know how.
549	00:35:46	00:35:48	You heard Grissom.
550	00:35:48	00:35:51	The more the why, the less the how the less the how, the more the why.
551	00:35:51	00:35:52	Hey, Nick.
552	00:35:52	00:35:54	Yeah?
553	00:35:54	00:35:56	Grissom's not always right.
554	00:35:56	00:35:57	Do yourself a favor.
555	00:35:57	00:35:59	Think for yourself.
556	00:35:59	00:36:02	I mean that as a friend, okay?
557	00:36:02	00:36:07	Okay, Detective, we've got some more homework to do.
558	00:36:07	00:36:09	What are you playing, time-share coffins?
559	00:36:09	00:36:11	Uh, there's no such thing as a time-share coffin.
560	00:36:11	00:36:12	Sure there is.
561	00:36:12	00:36:16	Once the funeral is over, you dump the body and use the same casket over and over.
562	00:36:16	00:36:18	You can't prove that.
563	00:36:18	00:36:19	Yes, I can.
564	00:36:19	00:36:25	This is a set of prints on the inside of the plastic sheeting we found in the dumpster.
565	00:36:25	00:36:28	What are the odds they belong to you?
566	00:36:30	00:36:36	All you had to do was put the bodies back in the grave and no one would have been the wiser.
567	00:36:36	00:36:39	You have no idea what a cutthroat business this is.
568	00:36:39	00:36:41	The chains are moving in.
569	00:36:41	00:36:42	I have payments to make.
570	00:36:42	00:36:46	I see the world from a completely different perspective than most people.
571	00:36:46	00:36:47	Yeah, I know.
572	00:36:47	00:36:48	You see dead people. So do I.
573	00:36:48	00:36:53	And when they turn up in dumpsters I like to see they get back to where they belong.
574	00:36:53	00:36:54	I'll repay the money.
575	00:36:54	00:36:55	Minimum.
576	00:36:55	00:36:59	Then you're going to pay for Stephanie Reyes' family to have a real burial. Okay.
577	00:36:59	00:37:00	At a respectable mortuary.
578	00:37:00	00:37:01	Okay.
579	00:37:02	00:37:04	Then we're going to let the DA run a table.
580	00:37:06	00:37:08	Did some homework on Kate.
581	00:37:08	00:37:09	Mm-hmm.
582	00:37:09	00:37:11	Financial records for the last year.
583	00:37:11	00:37:12	Great.
584	00:37:13	00:37:18	Personal checks from Kate Armstrong to Vernon Woods over the last year.
585	00:37:18	00:37:22	$5,000. Another for $5,000.
586	00:37:23	00:37:27	loans.
587	00:37:27	00:37:30	I don't think so.
588	00:37:30	00:37:34	I think she was paying him off for something.
589	00:37:34	00:37:35	Did Julia say anything?
590	00:37:35	00:37:37	Like what?
591	00:37:38	00:37:41	The real reason you killed Woods?
592	00:37:42	00:37:45	This is where Grissom and I differ.
593	00:37:45	00:37:48	Forensics is about more than science.
594	00:37:48	00:37:49	Human behavior.
595	00:37:49	00:37:53	The inconsistencies of human behavior.
596	00:37:53	00:37:59	Yes, how is crucially important, but so is why.
597	00:38:04	00:38:07	Okay.
598	00:38:07	00:38:08	I'm finished paying you.
599	00:38:09	00:38:11	We're going to live openly, honestly.
600	00:38:11	00:38:13	It's a new century.
601	00:38:13	00:38:14	Parents are evolved.
602	00:38:14	00:38:16	Not where their children are concerned.
603	00:38:16	00:38:20	I'll tell everybody that I caught you two having sex on school grounds.
604	00:38:20	00:38:21	That's a lie! What?!
605	00:38:21	00:38:23	Of course it's a lie.
606	00:38:23	00:38:26	That didn't stop the McMartin School from closing down.
607	00:38:28	00:38:31	Yeah, I think I'll make a call.
608	00:38:35	00:38:41	Julia and I would never have survived a rumor like that.
609	00:38:41	00:38:43	We panicked.
610	00:38:43	00:38:45	The school is our whole life.
611	00:38:49	00:38:51	Mm, you got your why.
612	00:38:51	00:38:53	Crime of passion.
613	00:38:56	00:38:59	why did it have to come down to this?
614	00:39:00	00:39:03	I guess they didn't feel like they had a choice.
615	00:39:03	00:39:06	Maybe they didn't.
616	00:39:06	00:39:11	A lose-lose situation.
617	00:39:15	00:39:18	I'm telling you, I didn't kill Eric.
618	00:39:18	00:39:20	Can you remember your last hours with him Saturday?
619	00:39:20	00:39:21	Don't answer that.
620	00:39:21	00:39:22	I want to answer it.
621	00:39:22	00:39:26	I just... I can't remember anything after we took that stuff.
622	00:39:26	00:39:28	It's not about memory now, Bobby.
623	00:39:28	00:39:35	It's about the evidence and the evidence... sucks.
624	00:39:35	00:39:38	You and Eric bought jimson tea from Ethan that night.
625	00:39:38	00:39:40	Enjoy, fellas!
626	00:39:43	00:39:46	Cheers, man.
627	00:39:46	00:39:52	But you guys have never taken j-weed before so you weren't aware of the side effects of photophobia.
628	00:39:52	00:39:53	Ph-photo what?
629	00:39:53	00:39:54	Photophobia.
630	00:39:54	00:39:57	It's just a big word for lights freaking you out.
631	00:39:57	00:40:02	You guys were hallucinating and whatever Eric was seeing was scaring him, big-time.
632	00:40:14	00:40:19	The coroner states that Eric's dose shot his temperature through the roof.
633	00:40:19	00:40:21	He was boiling in his own skin.
634	00:40:21	00:40:24	So he stripped which is why we found him naked.
635	00:40:32	00:40:35	We just don't know if it was an act of aggression or self-defense.
636	00:40:35	00:40:36	I loved that guy.
637	00:40:36	00:40:40	That's why I tend to believe it was an act of self-protection.
638	00:40:40	00:40:42	The lights were scaring him.
639	00:40:42	00:40:47	At the same time, we conjecture that you were suffering auditory hallucinations.
640	00:40:47	00:40:50	Both of these symptoms are routine with this drug.
641	00:40:55	00:40:57	Shut up! Shut up!
642	00:40:57	00:40:59	Shut up! Shut up!
643	00:40:59	00:41:02	Shut up! Shut... shut up!
644	00:41:04	00:41:06	Shut up...
645	00:41:06	00:41:11	I just... I-I can't remember, honest.
646	00:41:11	00:41:14	You can believe and conjecture all you want.
647	00:41:14	00:41:16	None of this is based on fact.
648	00:41:16	00:41:18	I'm afraid that it is.
649	00:41:18	00:41:23	The evidence tells us that Bobby suffocated Eric.
650	00:41:25	00:41:35	We found traces of aluminum trapped in Eric's nostrils that are consistent with what we found in your client's hands and arms earlier today from his job at the fireworks plant.
651	00:41:37	00:41:40	I don't think I would do that.
652	00:41:40	00:41:45	I know, Bobby, but you did.
653	00:41:51	00:41:54	This is a mold of the bite mark that we took from your arm today.
654	00:41:58	00:42:02	This is a mold of Eric's mouth, postmortem.
655	00:42:10	00:42:15	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
656	00:42:15	00:42:18	Come on, you shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
657	00:42:18	00:42:20	You shut up!
658	00:42:25	00:42:29	You overpowered him. He suffocated...
659	00:42:29	00:42:33	and then finally the noise stopped.
660	00:42:40	00:42:44	I can tell you right now we're going to plead diminished capacity.
661	00:42:44	00:42:45	Good.
662	00:42:45	00:42:48	I hope you win.
663	00:42:48	00:42:49	It doesn't matter.
664	00:42:49	00:42:52	It's the difference between prison and a hospital, Bobby.
665	00:42:52	00:42:53	It matters.
666	00:42:54	00:42:56	You don't understand.
667	00:42:56	00:42:58	I don't care what happens to me.
668	00:42:58	00:43:01	I killed my best friend.
669	00:43:39	00:43:40	Where you going?
670	00:43:40	00:43:42	Away.
