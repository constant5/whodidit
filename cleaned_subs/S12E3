0	00:00:16	00:00:19	Five grand?!
1	00:00:19	00:00:22	For this?!
2	00:00:22	00:00:23	It speaks to me.
3	00:00:23	00:00:24	Really.
4	00:00:24	00:00:27	Well, look at the face-- no expression.
5	00:00:27	00:00:29	'Cause it's a frying pan.
6	00:00:31	00:00:32	Come over here.
7	00:00:39	00:00:40	Now are you getting hungry?
8	00:00:40	00:00:42	The Golden Nugget has a really good steak house.
9	00:00:42	00:00:44	Come on, Nick, just give it a try.
10	00:00:45	00:00:47	Tell me what you see.
11	00:00:47	00:00:50	Okay, uh, a banged-up muffler.
12	00:00:51	00:00:52	Car accident.
13	00:00:53	00:00:54	No?
14	00:00:54	00:00:56	What then?
15	00:00:56	00:00:59	Mm... says to me...
16	00:00:59	00:01:06	two people breaking down the walls that they've built around their hearts, surrendering to their innermost feelings.
17	00:01:08	00:01:10	That's really nice.
18	00:01:10	00:01:11	Thank you.
19	00:01:11	00:01:15	All right, okay, I can do some curating here.
20	00:01:18	00:01:21	Oh, boy, this one's yelling at me.
21	00:01:21	00:01:23	Oh, yeah? Yeah.
22	00:01:23	00:01:27	Yeah, the cement, the brick, the metal...
23	00:01:27	00:01:28	It's very heavy.
24	00:01:28	00:01:35	We all carry a load in this life and if we can't overcome our burdens, we'll be crushed like a beer can.
25	00:01:35	00:01:37	That was beautiful.
26	00:01:37	00:01:39	Thank you.
27	00:01:45	00:01:47	Oh, wow! It's interactive.
28	00:01:50	00:01:52	Whew.
29	00:01:52	00:01:53	You know what it's telling me now?
30	00:01:53	00:01:55	What?
31	00:01:55	00:01:57	This date's over.
32	00:01:58	00:02:00	Hi.
33	00:02:00	00:02:01	Thank you.
34	00:02:07	00:02:08	Nice catch.
35	00:02:08	00:02:10	It's definitely human.
36	00:02:10	00:02:13	You think there's a real arm in there?
37	00:02:13	00:02:16	At these prices, I'm thinking an arm and a leg.
38	00:02:18	00:02:20	Hey, come here.
39	00:02:23	00:02:25	Which one is she? Hmm?
40	00:02:25	00:02:26	Oh, come on.
41	00:02:26	00:02:28	Art gallery opening. It's not your thing.
42	00:02:28	00:02:30	You're on a date, right?
43	00:02:30	00:02:32	What?
44	00:02:32	00:02:33	No, wait, wait-- let me guess.
45	00:02:33	00:02:34	The pretty brunette?
46	00:02:34	00:02:36	It's Doc Robbins' niece.
47	00:02:36	00:02:38	She's in from Ohio. I'm just showing her around.
48	00:02:38	00:02:39	It's one date she'll never forget.
49	00:02:39	00:02:40	Mm.
50	00:02:42	00:02:44	See, am I crazy?
51	00:02:44	00:02:46	What do you see?
52	00:02:46	00:02:48	Please don't start that.
53	00:02:48	00:02:50	Well...
54	00:02:50	00:02:52	I wouldn't be putting my face in there.
55	00:02:52	00:02:53	Yeah, you know what?
56	00:02:53	00:02:54	You're right. You do it.
57	00:02:55	00:02:57	That's an order.
58	00:03:03	00:03:06	Nose, cheekbone, eye socket.
59	00:03:06	00:03:09	Half a face, right?
60	00:03:09	00:03:11	Yeah, looks like it.
61	00:03:11	00:03:12	Is there an artist in the house here?
62	00:03:12	00:03:15	Yeah.
63	00:03:15	00:03:16	Come here.
64	00:03:17	00:03:18	I'm-I'm the artist.
65	00:03:18	00:03:20	Name?
66	00:03:20	00:03:21	Slade.
67	00:03:21	00:03:23	What's your last name, Slade?
68	00:03:23	00:03:24	Just Slade.
69	00:03:24	00:03:28	Well, this is just Stokes and I'm just Russell, crime lab.
70	00:03:28	00:03:29	We love what you're doing here.
71	00:03:29	00:03:32	The cement's fresh, the hint of decomp.
72	00:03:32	00:03:33	It's nice.
73	00:03:33	00:03:36	Maybe you better tell us about your process.
74	00:03:36	00:03:38	I'm an artist, man.
75	00:03:38	00:03:40	I find things.
76	00:03:40	00:03:42	They tell me what they want to be.
77	00:03:42	00:03:45	Do these blocks talk to you before or after the cement dries?
78	00:03:45	00:03:48	It's called found art for a reason.
79	00:03:48	00:03:51	Like, that's how I found them.
80	00:03:51	00:03:52	Where'd you find it?
81	00:03:52	00:03:56	Tresser Park. Dump site.
82	00:03:56	00:03:58	Prime objet turf.
83	00:03:58	00:04:01	Objet? What the...? I'll translate.
84	00:04:01	00:04:02	You know something, pal, you're going to come with us.
85	00:04:02	00:04:08	And if we don't find some objet in Tresser Park, it's going to be Bonjour, Bastille.
86	00:04:08	00:04:09	Hello, prison.
87	00:04:48	00:04:51	Man, all this heat's gonna ruin my spot.
88	00:04:51	00:04:52	Our market's cutthroat.
89	00:04:54	00:04:57	Hey, uh, how much for a used cop car?
90	00:04:57	00:04:59	Maybe you got one that's been all shot up?
91	00:04:59	00:05:02	Give it a rest, Picasso.
92	00:05:04	00:05:06	Is that evidence, too?
93	00:05:06	00:05:10	This? No, that's a perfectly good hibachi.
94	00:05:10	00:05:13	You aren't really thinking about taking that home with you, are you?
95	00:05:13	00:05:16	Hell, yes. This'll clean up great.
96	00:05:16	00:05:18	There's enough junk in the world already.
97	00:05:18	00:05:19	Why buy more?
98	00:05:21	00:05:25	Hey, would you tag that?
99	00:05:25	00:05:27	You need a TV, too?
100	00:05:27	00:05:28	No, for the serial number.
101	00:05:28	00:05:31	In case one of our litter bugs is the killer.
102	00:05:31	00:05:33	Or saw the killer.
103	00:05:33	00:05:35	Got some cement blocks over here.
104	00:05:35	00:05:37	Could be more body parts.
105	00:05:37	00:05:39	Go ahead and tag the microwave, too.
106	00:05:44	00:05:45	Oh, man.
107	00:05:47	00:05:52	I think we just found our missing face.
108	00:05:52	00:05:55	Early instars of the Black Soldier Fly.
109	00:05:55	00:05:56	Cheese Skippers. Hide Beetles.
110	00:05:56	00:05:59	That face has been exposed about three weeks.
111	00:05:59	00:06:03	Killed, cut up, encased in cement.
112	00:06:05	00:06:08	Did you ever read The Lady in Cement?
113	00:06:08	00:06:10	What do you think?
114	00:06:10	00:06:12	It's a great book.
115	00:06:12	00:06:13	So-so movie.
116	00:06:13	00:06:15	Frank Sinatra, Raquel Welch.
117	00:06:15	00:06:16	It was a Mob hit.
118	00:06:16	00:06:20	They fitted the lady with cement shoes, and then threw her in the ocean.
119	00:06:20	00:06:23	That's a good way to dispose of the body.
120	00:06:25	00:06:26	What do you think?
121	00:06:26	00:06:32	Killer tosses the block, it rolls down the hill...
122	00:06:35	00:06:39	...the block splits open, exposes the head.
123	00:06:43	00:06:45	Wait a second.
124	00:06:45	00:06:46	What you got?
125	00:06:46	00:06:49	A flower earring-- I've seen that before.
126	00:06:50	00:06:56	Five girls were abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered, dismembered... then encased in cement.
127	00:06:56	00:06:59	Was it a cold case? No, no. We solved it.
128	00:06:59	00:07:00	It was a husband and wife team.
129	00:07:00	00:07:02	They were convicted a couple of years ago.
130	00:07:02	00:07:04	It was Sara's case.
131	00:07:04	00:07:09	Colleen, what do you think? Hm?
132	00:07:09	00:07:10	I wore this just for you.
133	00:07:10	00:07:12	You like it?
134	00:07:12	00:07:14	I know you've been waiting for this all day.
135	00:07:14	00:07:17	Oh, you're such a pretty girl.
136	00:07:20	00:07:22	You pulled this from my old case files.
137	00:07:24	00:07:27	Last sip is yours.
138	00:07:27	00:07:28	Hmm?
139	00:07:34	00:07:40	Say, I want to be a good girl.
140	00:07:40	00:07:42	I want to be a good girl.
141	00:07:42	00:07:43	Oh.
142	00:07:44	00:07:47	Good girl.
143	00:07:47	00:07:48	Go on, Gina.
144	00:07:48	00:07:51	Give the good girl a reward.
145	00:07:51	00:07:54	How did a woman like this not get life?
146	00:07:54	00:07:57	Because the jury never saw these.
147	00:07:57	00:08:01	Gina Sinclair's husband, Todd, hid their sex tapes in his grandmother's attic.
148	00:08:01	00:08:05	We found them after she died, but it was, uh, three weeks after the verdict.
149	00:08:08	00:08:12	Colleen Hughes was their only surviving victim?
150	00:08:12	00:08:16	They, um, held her captive for three years.
151	00:08:16	00:08:17	How did she walk out of there?
152	00:08:17	00:08:19	What did she do differently?
153	00:08:19	00:08:23	The psychiatrist said that Colleen was completely compliant.
154	00:08:23	00:08:27	She indulged their fantasies, she never challenged them.
155	00:08:27	00:08:30	Most kids wouldn't be able to get past the fear.
156	00:08:30	00:08:32	As soon as I heard from Nick, I called the prison.
157	00:08:32	00:08:34	Gina got out two months ago.
158	00:08:34	00:08:36	Early release with parole.
159	00:08:36	00:08:39	I'm not surprised. She is a master manipulator.
160	00:08:39	00:08:47	She sold a sob story to the jury that her husband controlled her, that he forced her to abuse the girls, that he threatened her life.
161	00:08:47	00:08:50	Which explains why she got five years, and he got 120.
162	00:08:50	00:08:52	He was not the one in control.
163	00:08:52	00:08:53	She was.
164	00:08:53	00:08:55	So, you think that now that she's out...
165	00:08:55	00:08:56	She's picking up right where she left off.
166	00:08:56	00:08:58	Flower earrings and cement.
167	00:08:58	00:09:00	I was on this case then.
168	00:09:00	00:09:02	I want on it now.
169	00:09:02	00:09:05	Well, I guess there's something to be said for continuity.
170	00:09:19	00:09:22	Oh, if you're feeling homesick for L.A., this should cure you.
171	00:09:22	00:09:25	(laughs) Not this homesick.
172	00:09:25	00:09:28	Listen, I'm not saying I'm one to date guys on the job, but can I ask you a personal question?
173	00:09:28	00:09:30	Yeah, sure.
174	00:09:30	00:09:32	I heard Nick was on a date with Robbins' niece.
175	00:09:32	00:09:33	They an item?
176	00:09:36	00:09:39	Hey, guys.
177	00:09:40	00:09:43	Welcome to my third trash run of the day.
178	00:09:43	00:09:46	In L.A., they at least leave the underwear.
179	00:09:46	00:09:51	Blunt force trauma, a little blood, but no blood pool.
180	00:09:51	00:09:55	Slight lividity on his back.
181	00:09:55	00:09:58	But it's more prominent in his lower extremities.
182	00:09:58	00:10:00	No blanching on the soles of his feet.
183	00:10:00	00:10:02	It's weird.
184	00:10:02	00:10:05	Guy died standing up, but not standing on anything.
185	00:10:05	00:10:07	Maybe he was suspended.
186	00:10:07	00:10:08	Hung.
187	00:10:08	00:10:11	No. No. No ligature marks.
188	00:10:11	00:10:12	Roll him?
189	00:10:12	00:10:13	Yeah.
190	00:10:13	00:10:15	A little help?
191	00:10:15	00:10:17	One, two, three.
192	00:10:19	00:10:21	Pretty well fed for a junkie.
193	00:10:23	00:10:24	No jaundice.
194	00:10:24	00:10:27	No track marks.
195	00:10:27	00:10:28	Check his teeth.
196	00:10:28	00:10:30	Nice pearlies.
197	00:10:30	00:10:34	Didn't brush today, but not on the pipe.
198	00:10:34	00:10:35	So we can forget the trash run.
199	00:10:35	00:10:38	He was dumped.
200	00:10:38	00:10:40	Oh, this is good.
201	00:11:37	00:11:44	Based on the lack of eruption of the wisdom teeth, I'd estimate she's... 12 to 15 years old.
202	00:11:44	00:11:46	Same age as all the Sinclair victims.
203	00:11:46	00:11:48	I sent her dental X-rays to Missing Persons.
204	00:11:48	00:11:50	Hopefully it'll give us an I.D.
205	00:11:50	00:11:53	Evidence of sexual assault?
206	00:11:53	00:11:57	I found significant vaginal trauma, possibly involving a foreign object.
207	00:11:57	00:11:59	Gina used to, um, use beer bottles.
208	00:11:59	00:12:02	I sent the SAE kit to DNA.
209	00:12:02	00:12:04	C.O.D.?
210	00:12:04	00:12:08	Well, aside from the hack job, no other signs of obvious trauma.
211	00:12:08	00:12:11	Condition of the body makes it hard to tell much of anything.
212	00:12:12	00:12:16	Sinclair's previous victims were all dismembered at the major joints.
213	00:12:16	00:12:20	Tool marks are almost identical to our cement girl here.
214	00:12:20	00:12:23	We never did figure out what they used to cut up the bodies.
215	00:12:23	00:12:25	Same M.O., same tool.
216	00:12:25	00:12:27	I don't think we're looking at a copycat here.
217	00:12:27	00:12:29	We know who we're looking for.
218	00:12:29	00:12:31	Gina Sinclair.
219	00:12:31	00:12:33	Sara's not the only one who knows she's out of prison.
220	00:12:35	00:12:36	Whose Web site is this?
221	00:12:36	00:12:38	Ed Burrows.
222	00:12:38	00:12:42	His daughter Jennifer was the Sinclairs' second victim.
223	00:12:42	00:12:47	This guy has quit his job, sold his house, pretty much devoted his life to seeing the Sinclairs put away.
224	00:12:47	00:12:49	Somebody killed my daughter, I'd do the same thing.
225	00:12:49	00:12:53	And if I found out they got out of prison, I'd have eyes on them, too.
226	00:12:53	00:12:57	There's a lot of people that would like to see Gina Sinclair pay for what she did.
227	00:12:57	00:13:00	And by people, you mean Sara.
228	00:13:00	00:13:01	You know how it is.
229	00:13:01	00:13:09	You, uh, live with a case for a couple of years, you obviously get very close to the victims and their families, and then justice isn't served.
230	00:13:09	00:13:11	She said she wants another shot.
231	00:13:11	00:13:13	Should I be worried?
232	00:13:13	00:13:15	I know why Ecklie brought you in.
233	00:13:15	00:13:20	Clearly, as a supervisor, I was too close to my team.
234	00:13:20	00:13:23	I allowed one of them to walk into a house with a serial killer.
235	00:13:23	00:13:26	Right. Wh-What are you saying?
236	00:13:26	00:13:29	I'm saying that you can't let Sara walk through that same door.
237	00:13:29	00:13:30	You are the supervisor now.
238	00:13:30	00:13:32	You've gotta protect the team.
239	00:13:32	00:13:34	Okay, I got that.
240	00:13:35	00:13:37	And I appreciate the heads up.
241	00:13:40	00:13:42	Okay.
242	00:14:06	00:14:08	Mr. Burrows...
243	00:14:14	00:14:16	I'm more than 200 feet away from her place.
244	00:14:16	00:14:17	You can check for yourself.
245	00:14:17	00:14:19	I'm not here about the restraining order.
246	00:14:21	00:14:25	I heard they found another body.
247	00:14:25	00:14:28	Mr. Burrows, when was the last time you were home?
248	00:14:31	00:14:33	My wife kicked me out three weeks ago.
249	00:14:33	00:14:36	I'm sorry.
250	00:14:36	00:14:38	I, um, I've seen your Web site.
251	00:14:38	00:14:40	You've been busy.
252	00:14:42	00:14:44	She's a killer.
253	00:14:44	00:14:47	There's no way I can stand around and do nothing.
254	00:14:47	00:14:48	Ed, do me a favor.
255	00:14:48	00:14:52	Go home, make up with your wife...
256	00:14:52	00:14:54	let us do our job... okay?
257	00:15:17	00:15:19	Gordon! Stop running!
258	00:15:29	00:15:32	CSI Sidle, right?
259	00:15:32	00:15:33	Mm.
260	00:15:33	00:15:34	Care for a cold one?
261	00:15:34	00:15:36	You look good, Gina.
262	00:15:36	00:15:37	I guess prison agreed with you.
263	00:15:39	00:15:40	And you're looking a little pale.
264	00:15:40	00:15:45	Yeah, I spend most of my time in a lab busting psychopaths like you.
265	00:15:45	00:15:48	We, um... found a girl.
266	00:15:48	00:15:49	In cement.
267	00:15:50	00:15:52	That's got nothing to do with me.
268	00:15:52	00:15:55	Good. Then you won't mind if I search your apartment.
269	00:15:55	00:15:56	Well, it's kind of a mess.
270	00:15:56	00:15:58	Maid's day off.
271	00:15:58	00:16:00	You're on a parole. I don't need a warrant.
272	00:16:00	00:16:01	I don't need to be harassed by you.
273	00:16:01	00:16:04	Or by numbnuts out in the car.
274	00:16:04	00:16:06	Burrows has been stalking me ever since I got out.
275	00:16:06	00:16:10	Well, you, um, raped, murdered and dismembered his daughter.
276	00:16:10	00:16:12	Court said Todd did it.
277	00:16:13	00:16:16	I'm as much of a victim as those other girls.
278	00:16:25	00:16:26	Am I blocking your view?
279	00:16:26	00:16:28	I'm just admiring the flowers.
280	00:16:30	00:16:31	Excuse me...
281	00:16:31	00:16:34	may I have your attention?
282	00:16:34	00:16:36	I am with the Las Vegas police department.
283	00:16:36	00:16:43	Your neighbor here, Gina Sinclair, Apartment 206, is a rapist and a murderer.
284	00:16:45	00:16:48	And, if I were you, I would keep an eye on your children.
285	00:16:51	00:16:52	Get up.
286	00:16:52	00:16:54	I'm calling your parole officer.
287	00:16:54	00:16:56	Let's see what kind of mess your maid left.
288	00:17:02	00:17:03	Look, I already know why you called me in here.
289	00:17:03	00:17:10	I paid a visit today to a person of interest, who, by any reasonable measure, is our prime suspect, and I executed a search.
290	00:17:10	00:17:15	Yeah, and in the process, in front of 30 of her neighbors, called her a rapist, a murderer...
291	00:17:15	00:17:16	And a psychopath.
292	00:17:16	00:17:18	But that was to her face.
293	00:17:18	00:17:26	Well, you should know that her attorney has threatened to sue the department and you for harassment, which he has every right to do.
294	00:17:30	00:17:34	My son is on the freshman team at WLVU.
295	00:17:34	00:17:36	The kid's been practicing since he was six.
296	00:17:36	00:17:38	And you know something?
297	00:17:38	00:17:43	In junior high, he used to practice at night, and he wanted to walk home, but I wouldn't let him.
298	00:17:43	00:17:44	One of us always picked him up.
299	00:17:46	00:17:49	Kids should be able to walk home from school.
300	00:17:49	00:17:54	These girls should have been able to walk home.
301	00:17:54	00:17:58	You know, I want the Gina Sinclairs of the world off the street just as much as you do.
302	00:17:58	00:17:59	I was just taking her temperature.
303	00:17:59	00:18:01	Yeah, rectally.
304	00:18:01	00:18:05	You showed your hand today to a master manipulator.
305	00:18:05	00:18:07	Your words.
306	00:18:07	00:18:08	Her neighbors have a right to know.
307	00:18:08	00:18:13	She did this, five years ago, three weeks ago, and she's gonna do it again.
308	00:18:13	00:18:16	Yeah, and maybe now, she'll get away with it, again.
309	00:18:16	00:18:23	Look, you know this, when we walk into court, if the defense can't attack the evidence, they attack us, which is why we need to be unbiased and impartial.
310	00:18:23	00:18:27	You-- no-- you blew it today.
311	00:18:27	00:18:30	In front of 30 potential jurors.
312	00:18:30	00:18:31	And I don't want to lose this, Sara.
313	00:18:31	00:18:32	I want to win.
314	00:18:32	00:18:34	So do I.
315	00:18:36	00:18:37	Am I off the case?
316	00:18:37	00:18:43	Because, if I am, someone needs to call Colleen Hughes and tell her that Gina's out of prison.
317	00:18:45	00:18:48	Maybe I should handle that.
318	00:18:58	00:19:02	Good call on the dual livor mortis.
319	00:19:02	00:19:04	Thank you.
320	00:19:04	00:19:06	I didn't get this job 'cause of nepotism.
321	00:19:06	00:19:09	Never crossed my mind.
322	00:19:09	00:19:11	Am I late?
323	00:19:11	00:19:12	Nope.
324	00:19:12	00:19:13	I'm always early.
325	00:19:13	00:19:15	You don't see this too often.
326	00:19:15	00:19:17	Lungs are distended.
327	00:19:17	00:19:20	They should feel like deflated balloons.
328	00:19:20	00:19:23	These feel more like pillows, but heavy.
329	00:19:23	00:19:24	May I?
330	00:19:24	00:19:26	Yeah.
331	00:19:28	00:19:29	Oh, that's awesome.
332	00:19:31	00:19:32	Let's see how much they weigh.
333	00:19:34	00:19:36	Whoa!
334	00:19:40	00:19:42	That looks like, uh...
335	00:19:42	00:19:43	Chocolate.
336	00:19:44	00:19:46	Guy's a soufflé.
337	00:19:46	00:19:54	Lungs full of chocolate, lividity in the lower extremities, died vertical but not on his feet, and not hung.
338	00:19:54	00:19:56	Victim was floating.
339	00:19:56	00:19:58	Doc, is it possible for somebody to drown in chocolate?
340	00:20:00	00:20:03	So, milk or dark chocolate?
341	00:20:03	00:20:05	Really? That's your first question?
342	00:20:05	00:20:09	No, but it's gonna be my wife's, as soon as I tell her this story.
343	00:20:09	00:20:13	Well, we sent chocolate samples to Hodges.
344	00:20:13	00:20:15	Okay, so what's our guy weigh?
345	00:20:15	00:20:19	221, give or take a little fudge.
346	00:20:19	00:20:21	How tall is he? Five-eleven-ish.
347	00:20:21	00:20:24	So what do you think, maybe a hundred plus gallons?
348	00:20:24	00:20:26	Well, at least.
349	00:20:26	00:20:27	I mean, he must have drowned in a lot of chocolate.
350	00:20:27	00:20:32	Right, so-- Oh, you guys, there's this great book you'd love.
351	00:20:32	00:20:37	Uh, Road to Wellville by T.C. Boyle.
352	00:20:37	00:20:44	There's a part where a man kills his adopted son by drowning him in a vat of macadamia nut butter.
353	00:20:46	00:20:47	All right, well, I guess we should...
354	00:20:47	00:20:48	Find the vat.
355	00:20:48	00:20:50	Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
356	00:20:50	00:20:51	Thanks.
357	00:20:59	00:21:02	Okay... Ryan Thomas?
358	00:21:12	00:21:16	You know that dumping's illegal, right, Mr. Thomas?
359	00:21:16	00:21:19	It's an $800 fine.
360	00:21:19	00:21:21	It was just a busted microwave.
361	00:21:21	00:21:25	I mean, it doesn't even... microwave anymore.
362	00:21:25	00:21:26	Is that what you do with all your old stuff?
363	00:21:26	00:21:28	You just dump it in the ravine at Tresser Park?
364	00:21:28	00:21:30	I'm sorry, man.
365	00:21:30	00:21:32	It costs money to dump at the dump.
366	00:21:32	00:21:34	You throw anything else in that ravine?
367	00:21:34	00:21:35	No.
368	00:21:35	00:21:37	I mean, why are you sweating me?
369	00:21:37	00:21:39	It's not like I dumped a body or something.
370	00:21:39	00:21:40	Somebody did.
371	00:21:40	00:21:42	And your junk was right on top.
372	00:21:42	00:21:44	When'd you dump the microwave?
373	00:21:44	00:21:47	I don't know, about...
374	00:21:47	00:21:49	three weeks ago.
375	00:21:49	00:21:52	Did you see anybody else in the park that night?
376	00:21:52	00:21:55	There was a truck.
377	00:21:55	00:21:57	And it... peeled out.
378	00:21:57	00:21:58	Damn near hit me.
379	00:21:58	00:22:02	Did it look like...
380	00:22:02	00:22:03	that?
381	00:22:03	00:22:04	Maybe...
382	00:22:04	00:22:07	Yeah.
383	00:22:07	00:22:08	A chick was driving it.
384	00:22:08	00:22:10	She was hot.
385	00:22:10	00:22:12	Look, man, take my prints, my... my DNA.
386	00:22:12	00:22:14	I-I-I got to get back to work.
387	00:22:19	00:22:20	There you are.
388	00:22:20	00:22:22	But I just had a Coke.
389	00:22:22	00:22:23	Enjoy.
390	00:22:23	00:22:26	I can't believe they let her out.
391	00:22:27	00:22:29	Where is she?
392	00:22:29	00:22:34	Under the conditions of her parole, she has to stay in Vegas.
393	00:22:36	00:22:38	Of course she does.
394	00:22:38	00:22:41	So what, now she's free and I have to hide?
395	00:22:41	00:22:44	No. No. No one says you have to hide.
396	00:22:44	00:22:48	But maybe you should move back in with your parents, just for a while.
397	00:22:48	00:22:51	No way.
398	00:22:51	00:22:55	Do you have any idea what it's like to live with parents who thought that you were dead?
399	00:22:56	00:22:59	Do you have any friends you can stay with?
400	00:22:59	00:23:01	I don't have any friends because I don't trust anyone.
401	00:23:01	00:23:04	The shrinks call it PTSD.
402	00:23:05	00:23:11	I say, once you've been chained to a bed and raped for 1,112 days...
403	00:23:11	00:23:13	it's better to be alone.
404	00:23:21	00:23:23	Okay. Um...
405	00:23:23	00:23:26	I-I'll try to arrange for some police protection.
406	00:23:26	00:23:28	No.
407	00:23:28	00:23:31	Why don't you send the cops to her place?
408	00:23:31	00:23:33	I can take care of myself.
409	00:23:35	00:23:38	I'm done being a victim.
410	00:23:40	00:23:42	All right. Um...
411	00:23:42	00:23:47	this has the number to the department on the front, but that's my cell phone on the back.
412	00:23:47	00:23:49	I want you to call me.
413	00:23:49	00:23:52	Colleen, I want you to call me anytime you want.
414	00:24:02	00:24:04	Samantha Chase, 13.
415	00:24:04	00:24:06	Our girl in cement.
416	00:24:06	00:24:10	Doc Robbins I.D.'d her off of her dental records.
417	00:24:10	00:24:14	She was last seen three weeks ago leaving Desert Palm Library.
418	00:24:14	00:24:16	Library is here.
419	00:24:16	00:24:18	Samantha Chase's home is here.
420	00:24:18	00:24:21	And Gina Sinclair's condo is right in the middle.
421	00:24:21	00:24:23	We know that...
422	00:24:23	00:24:25	both of her parents work.
423	00:24:25	00:24:27	Latchkey kid.
424	00:24:27	00:24:30	She walks home from the library every day, right past Gina's window.
425	00:24:30	00:24:31	Same age.
426	00:24:31	00:24:32	Even looks like the previous victims.
427	00:24:32	00:24:34	Gina's a predator.
428	00:24:34	00:24:37	She probably waited for the right moment, and then she just grabbed her.
429	00:24:37	00:24:38	Yeah, but you said you searched Gina's place.
430	00:24:38	00:24:42	Yes, and I didn't find anything, but that doesn't mean she didn't take her somewhere else.
431	00:24:42	00:24:43	Well, we need to find that someplace else.
432	00:24:43	00:24:44	And until we do, (phone ringing)
433	00:24:44	00:24:46	that's just a theory.
434	00:24:48	00:24:49	A theory.
435	00:24:49	00:24:53	Trace results from Samantha Chase's fingernail scrapings-- found dog hair.
436	00:24:53	00:24:54	Pomeranian.
437	00:24:54	00:24:57	Gina Sinclair has a Pomeranian.
438	00:25:07	00:25:11	This guy looks good from every angle.
439	00:25:12	00:25:14	If he's selling, I'm buying.
440	00:25:14	00:25:18	I'm not so sure it's chocolate he's selling.
441	00:25:18	00:25:21	Some studies suggest women prefer chocolate to sex.
442	00:25:21	00:25:23	I say, why not have both?
443	00:25:23	00:25:27	Angie Salinger, CEO, Sinful Pleasures.
444	00:25:27	00:25:29	I really like your ad campaign.
445	00:25:29	00:25:33	And we're investigating a guy who really liked your chocolate.
446	00:25:33	00:25:35	You recognize this guy?
447	00:25:35	00:25:38	Uh, yes. He came into the factory a few days ago, looking for a job.
448	00:25:38	00:25:40	Do you remember his name?
449	00:25:40	00:25:43	No, but I can have HR look him up.
450	00:25:43	00:25:45	Is he dead?
451	00:25:45	00:25:48	We believe that your chocolate was...
452	00:25:48	00:25:49	Involved.
453	00:25:49	00:25:51	This guy died from eating my chocolate?
454	00:25:51	00:25:53	More like inhaling it.
455	00:25:53	00:25:59	According to our chemical analysis, it was your Argentinean Virgin Honey Bee chocolate.
456	00:25:59	00:26:03	We're going to need to take a tour of your chocolate factory.
457	00:26:19	00:26:21	Oh, wow.
458	00:26:21	00:26:25	Floral hints of honey, combined with cocoa.
459	00:26:25	00:26:27	That's intense.
460	00:26:27	00:26:29	If I fall in, don't save me.
461	00:26:29	00:26:31	Copy that.
462	00:26:31	00:26:33	Hey, while you're up there, notice if anyone else fell in?
463	00:26:44	00:26:46	I'm thinking pube recall.
464	00:26:46	00:26:49	Well, looks like we found our primary.
465	00:26:49	00:26:55	If John Doe drowned in this vat, then by definition, he didn't climb out. Oh, he had help.
466	00:26:57	00:26:59	Six-foot drop.
467	00:26:59	00:27:01	Explains the postmortem BFT to the head.
468	00:27:03	00:27:06	Guy covered in chocolate-- that's gonna make a mess.
469	00:27:06	00:27:08	Somebody cleaned up.
470	00:27:08	00:27:13	Gave this place and our John Doe a bath.
471	00:27:21	00:27:23	Oh.
472	00:27:24	00:27:26	Piece of scalp.
473	00:27:28	00:27:29	Shut it down.
474	00:27:29	00:27:30	This place is a crime scene.
475	00:27:40	00:27:42	You wanted to see me?
476	00:27:42	00:27:44	Did you process these blocks?
477	00:27:44	00:27:45	Yes.
478	00:27:45	00:27:47	By yourself?
479	00:27:47	00:27:48	No, I worked with Nick.
480	00:27:48	00:27:50	Why, is there a problem or...?
481	00:27:50	00:27:52	These blocks are heavy.
482	00:27:52	00:27:55	Not surprising it's a two-person job.
483	00:27:59	00:28:01	Gina had help.
484	00:28:01	00:28:03	Like before.
485	00:28:03	00:28:06	I don't think she's a solo act.
486	00:28:06	00:28:10	She found another Todd-- somebody weak, someone easily controlled.
487	00:28:10	00:28:14	Find the weak link, nail Gina.
488	00:28:23	00:28:24	Is that your lunch?
489	00:28:24	00:28:26	Yeah.
490	00:28:27	00:28:31	I thought you guys said you found pubes in the cocoa.
491	00:28:31	00:28:33	No, this is pre-pube.
492	00:28:33	00:28:34	Oh.
493	00:28:34	00:28:37	You should try this.
494	00:28:37	00:28:42	Dark chocolate infused with pasilla chili, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon.
495	00:28:42	00:28:45	Oh, no, I've already got some chili, thanks.
496	00:28:45	00:28:49	So, did you get an I.D. on your victim yet-- the, uh, truffle guy?
497	00:28:49	00:28:50	Mm. Yeah.
498	00:28:50	00:28:53	25, local.
499	00:28:53	00:28:56	Greg and I searched his place.
500	00:28:56	00:28:58	Mm... sorry. Sticky.
501	00:28:58	00:29:01	Guy was drowning in chocolate.
502	00:29:01	00:29:03	Well, before he was drowning in chocolate.
503	00:29:03	00:29:06	Could be why he was hitting up Sinful Pleasures for a job.
504	00:29:06	00:29:08	You know what they say about loving your work.
505	00:29:08	00:29:10	Hey.
506	00:29:10	00:29:12	I love my work, too.
507	00:29:12	00:29:15	So chocolate wasn't Chad's only obsession.
508	00:29:15	00:29:19	Archie unlocked Chad's laptop.
509	00:29:19	00:29:21	That's the hot bod from the ad campaign.
510	00:29:21	00:29:26	Now, Chad has over a thousand images of hot bod on his photo file.
511	00:29:26	00:29:27	Check this out.
512	00:29:27	00:29:30	His eyes are amber.
513	00:29:32	00:29:34	Victim's eyes are amber.
514	00:29:34	00:29:40	Well, in order to get amber eyes, you need two recessive genes, one from Mom, one from Dad.
515	00:29:40	00:29:42	Typically found in less than one percent of the population.
516	00:29:42	00:29:44	One in a hundred shot.
517	00:29:44	00:29:45	Try one in one.
518	00:29:45	00:29:47	Pull up his old DMV photo.
519	00:29:49	00:29:50	Wow, it's the same guy.
520	00:29:50	00:29:52	Just more of him.
521	00:29:52	00:29:54	That's really depressing.
522	00:29:54	00:29:57	Gained a hundred pounds, lost his looks.
523	00:29:57	00:29:58	Lost more than that.
524	00:30:02	00:30:04	You lied to us when you said you didn't know Chad Ellis.
525	00:30:04	00:30:07	I don't.
526	00:30:07	00:30:09	He came into the factory looking for a job-- end of story.
527	00:30:09	00:30:12	Well, his photos are all over your factory.
528	00:30:12	00:30:15	That's Tristan Duran.
529	00:30:15	00:30:19	Now, him, I know-- every inch.
530	00:30:19	00:30:24	Then you can confirm the birthmark on his left butt cheek-- the one in the shape of Rhode Island?
531	00:30:24	00:30:25	Absolutely.
532	00:30:25	00:30:31	Well, Chad Ellis has a birthmark, too, only now it's the size of Texas.
533	00:30:32	00:30:34	When did you guys stop seeing each other?
534	00:30:34	00:30:36	It was a fling.
535	00:30:36	00:30:37	He moved on, I moved on.
536	00:30:37	00:30:39	Heard he was walking runways in Milan.
537	00:30:39	00:30:43	Well, apparently, he didn't walk them too long.
538	00:30:43	00:30:46	Just like your ad, he dipped into the chocolate.
539	00:30:46	00:30:48	Ate himself out of a career.
540	00:30:48	00:30:53	Broke, modeling days are over, he came to you for a job; any job.
541	00:30:53	00:30:56	I didn't know it was Tristan, I swear.
542	00:30:56	00:30:57	I think you did.
543	00:30:57	00:31:01	After all, he drowned in your chocolate, which means he had to make it past your security.
544	00:31:01	00:31:07	And somebody had to fish him out of the vat and clean him up and dump him in an alley.
545	00:31:10	00:31:12	Okay.
546	00:31:12	00:31:14	We're done here.
547	00:31:14	00:31:15	We'll let the jury decide.
548	00:31:15	00:31:18	I didn't kill the guy.
549	00:31:18	00:31:19	Then who did?
550	00:31:19	00:31:22	He killed himself.
551	00:31:23	00:31:28	Tristan, Chad, whatever-- he...
552	00:31:28	00:31:36	he came into the factory after hours, told my security guy he used to work there-- happiest days of his life-- paid him off, and told him that he needed some alone time.
553	00:31:36	00:31:39	He said he was moving on, wanted to say good-bye.
554	00:31:39	00:31:41	Well, he sure did.
555	00:31:53	00:31:55	How come you didn't call the cops?
556	00:31:57	00:32:00	Each of those vats is worth $20,000.
557	00:32:00	00:32:02	I call you guys and I'm out of business.
558	00:32:02	00:32:04	So you cleaned him up and dumped him in an alley?
559	00:32:04	00:32:06	I didn't.
560	00:32:06	00:32:09	My security guy did for an extra 50 bucks and his job.
561	00:32:09	00:32:13	It's not a crime; he killed himself.
562	00:32:13	00:32:16	Suicide... by chocolate.
563	00:32:16	00:32:21	Dumping a body is a Class-D felony.
564	00:32:21	00:32:26	And making false statements to the police-- that's the whipped cream on the sundae.
565	00:32:26	00:32:27	Or...
566	00:32:27	00:32:29	another year on the nickel.
567	00:32:32	00:32:34	I'm here because I'm worried about Colleen.
568	00:32:34	00:32:42	I called the café, she didn't show up for work, so I-I went over to her house, and that's when I found this.
569	00:32:42	00:32:45	What's going on?
570	00:32:45	00:32:51	Mrs. Hughes, I contacted your daughter to let her know that Gina Sinclair had been released from prison.
571	00:32:51	00:32:52	Oh.
572	00:32:52	00:32:55	Is, is Colleen in police protection?
573	00:32:58	00:32:59	Sara...
574	00:32:59	00:33:04	Supervisor Russell offered Colleen protection, but she declined.
575	00:33:06	00:33:08	I could feel it.
576	00:33:08	00:33:10	I knew something was wrong.
577	00:33:13	00:33:15	It's happening again.
578	00:33:15	00:33:17	She has her.
579	00:33:26	00:33:28	Burrows' car.
580	00:33:28	00:33:29	No Burrows.
581	00:33:29	00:33:31	Control, Charlie Zero-One-Russell.
582	00:33:31	00:33:36	Requesting immediate backup at Gina Sinclair's apartment.
583	00:33:36	00:33:38	You took the best thing from me!
584	00:33:38	00:33:40	Stop...!
585	00:33:40	00:33:42	Look at me!
586	00:33:42	00:33:43	No!
587	00:33:43	00:33:44	I'm gonna kill you. Ed?
588	00:33:45	00:33:46	Help me!
589	00:33:46	00:33:48	Don't you look away from me!
590	00:33:48	00:33:50	Ed, drop the knife!
591	00:33:50	00:33:51	Ed, listen to me.
592	00:33:51	00:33:52	Listen to me. Shoot him!
593	00:33:52	00:33:54	You did this. You did this!
594	00:33:54	00:33:55	You're not gonna get your daughter back this way.
595	00:33:55	00:33:56	You do this, she wins.
596	00:33:56	00:33:58	Come on, put it down.
597	00:33:58	00:33:59	She cut my little Jenny into pieces.
598	00:33:59	00:34:01	Just shoot him. (gun cocking)
599	00:34:01	00:34:04	Put the knife down, or I'll shoot.
600	00:34:04	00:34:06	We're all right. We're gonna be all right here.
601	00:34:06	00:34:07	Ed?
602	00:34:07	00:34:10	Colleen Hughes is missing, okay?
603	00:34:10	00:34:15	And Gina is the only person who knows where she is.
604	00:34:15	00:34:16	We need to find Colleen, okay?
605	00:34:16	00:34:18	We need you to put the knife down.
606	00:34:20	00:34:22	Ed, Ed, please!
607	00:34:23	00:34:24	Please.
608	00:34:30	00:34:31	There you go, buddy.
609	00:34:42	00:34:44	Thank you.
610	00:35:01	00:35:03	Fire in the hole!
611	00:35:35	00:35:37	You okay, Sara?
612	00:35:37	00:35:41	I heard it got pretty ugly over at Gina's.
613	00:35:41	00:35:43	Well, the good news is, she's in the hospital.
614	00:35:43	00:35:45	Bad news is, she's going to be okay.
615	00:35:45	00:35:48	And we still have no idea where they're holding Colleen.
616	00:35:48	00:35:53	Ed Burrows is facing kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon and attempted murder charges.
617	00:35:53	00:35:56	Once again, Gina skates.
618	00:35:56	00:35:58	Well, maybe not this time.
619	00:35:58	00:36:06	Hodges found traces of sodium metasilicate and anionic surfactant on cement girl's body parts.
620	00:36:06	00:36:07	Soap?
621	00:36:07	00:36:09	Not just any soap.
622	00:36:09	00:36:13	Soap that's used in industrial pressure washers, which got me thinking.
623	00:36:13	00:36:17	We never found the tool that was used to cut up the Sinclairs' victims, right?
624	00:36:17	00:36:18	Uh-uh.
625	00:36:18	00:36:22	So, I got one of those power washers, and used it on a pork shank.
626	00:36:22	00:36:23	And the traumatic injuries were consistent.
627	00:36:23	00:36:25	Those things are no joke.
628	00:36:25	00:36:28	So, Gina used a pressure washer to dismember the bodies?
629	00:36:28	00:36:32	But you know, we never found any trace of soap in the original case.
630	00:36:32	00:36:35	'Cause I don't think she used it.
631	00:36:35	00:36:36	I think that was Todd's job.
632	00:36:36	00:36:38	Todd knew to rinse off the soap.
633	00:36:38	00:36:40	Gina missed that step.
634	00:36:40	00:36:42	Or whoever she's teamed up with now.
635	00:36:42	00:36:44	So Gina has access to a pressure washer.
636	00:36:44	00:36:45	Yeah, I think so.
637	00:36:45	00:36:48	A big, fat, industrial one-- a $50,000 unit.
638	00:36:48	00:36:50	There's not a lot of those floating around.
639	00:36:57	00:36:59	Yeah, come here.
640	00:36:59	00:37:02	I love DNA.
641	00:37:02	00:37:05	I like Tox, too, but this new DNA gig-- it's like...
642	00:37:05	00:37:06	Yeah, Henry, you tapped.
643	00:37:06	00:37:08	Yes, I did, and...
644	00:37:08	00:37:10	I think I hit a grand slam. What do you got?
645	00:37:10	00:37:14	I examined the SAE kit on Samantha Chase-- the Lady in Cement.
646	00:37:14	00:37:19	Mm. Found semen on the vaginal swab, which I ran on my first post-qualification DNA batch.
647	00:37:19	00:37:23	All right, but why are you handing me the results of the entire 96 sample run?
648	00:37:23	00:37:27	Because I happened to notice that two of the samples were the same DNA.
649	00:37:27	00:37:28	A match.
650	00:37:28	00:37:30	Samantha Chase and Number 26.
651	00:37:30	00:37:32	26. Ryan Thomas.
652	00:37:32	00:37:34	Ryan Thomas.
653	00:37:34	00:37:36	He's the guy who threw the microwave down the ravine.
654	00:37:36	00:37:38	All I know is, it was his semen.
655	00:37:38	00:37:40	He had relations with the Lady in Cement.
656	00:37:40	00:37:43	Henry, home run, buddy.
657	00:37:43	00:37:45	Ryan Thomas partnered up with Gina.
658	00:37:45	00:37:49	They tortured and murdered Samantha Chase, and now they've got Colleen Hughes.
659	00:37:49	00:37:50	Oh, man, I had him.
660	00:37:50	00:37:52	Yeah, he was sitting right across from me.
661	00:37:52	00:37:53	(phone ringing) We still got him, Nick.
662	00:37:53	00:37:56	You swabbed his cheek, and you took his info.
663	00:37:56	00:37:58	All right, Brass checked out Thomas' place.
664	00:37:58	00:38:00	He wasn't there.
665	00:38:00	00:38:01	We have a broadcast out on the van.
666	00:38:01	00:38:03	So where did Thomas work?
667	00:38:03	00:38:05	He was a day laborer.
668	00:38:05	00:38:06	Construction, odd jobs.
669	00:38:06	00:38:07	Stuff like that.
670	00:38:07	00:38:09	Last employment was at a marina.
671	00:38:09	00:38:12	Hodges ran the fibers that you pulled from the cement blocks.
672	00:38:12	00:38:14	Said it was fiberglass.
673	00:38:14	00:38:17	The type used in auto body repair, as well as boats.
674	00:38:17	00:38:21	You know, in Seattle, when we take a boat out for the winter, you know what we do?
675	00:38:21	00:38:23	Power wash it.
676	00:38:23	00:38:27	So what marina employed Ryan Thomas?
677	00:38:35	00:38:36	There's a warehouse around the back.
678	00:38:36	00:38:38	Looks abandoned. Pop it.
679	00:39:00	00:39:01	No, don't cry.
680	00:39:01	00:39:02	You want to be a good girl, don't you?
681	00:39:02	00:39:04	Come on, say it. I want to be a good girl.
682	00:39:04	00:39:08	Say it. Say, I want to be a good girl.
683	00:39:08	00:39:09	Last sip is yours.
684	00:39:09	00:39:11	No, don't cry.
685	00:39:11	00:39:13	Say, I want to be a good girl.
686	00:39:13	00:39:15	Say it.
687	00:39:15	00:39:16	I want to be a good girl.
688	00:39:20	00:39:21	Police! On the ground, now!
689	00:39:21	00:39:23	Help me!
690	00:39:23	00:39:26	Don't you move! Don't you move!
691	00:39:26	00:39:29	Don't move. Don't move. Secure that man.
692	00:39:29	00:39:31	(panting) No. no.
693	00:39:31	00:39:32	No! Stop it! Don't touch me!
694	00:39:32	00:39:35	It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right.
695	00:39:36	00:39:37	Colleen?
696	00:39:37	00:39:40	I just wanted to give Gina another flower.
697	00:39:40	00:39:42	I'm a good girl.
698	00:39:42	00:39:45	I'm a good girl.
699	00:39:45	00:39:48	I'm not gonna let anybody else hurt you.
700	00:39:48	00:39:49	It's all right.
701	00:39:49	00:39:51	It's over.
702	00:40:14	00:40:21	The doctor says, uh, victims sometimes identify with their abusers.
703	00:40:21	00:40:28	Colleen is who she is because of what Gina Sinclair did to her.
704	00:40:28	00:40:32	Colleen was at a... a critical age when she was abducted.
705	00:40:32	00:40:36	She was still developing some key aspects of her personality.
706	00:40:36	00:40:41	I thought it was a miracle...
707	00:40:41	00:40:44	a gift that she survived.
708	00:40:44	00:40:46	And now...
709	00:40:56	00:41:00	How do I protect her from herself?
710	00:41:25	00:41:28	Hey.
711	00:41:28	00:41:29	Hey.
712	00:41:41	00:41:43	Have you eaten?
713	00:41:43	00:41:45	You know, I'm not really in the mood.
714	00:41:45	00:41:47	Yeah, I'm hungry, too.
715	00:41:47	00:41:49	You like Chinese?
716	00:41:52	00:41:54	Sushi?
