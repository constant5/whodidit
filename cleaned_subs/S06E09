3,00:00:46,00:00:47,Hey.
4,00:00:47,00:00:49,I was happy to hear the Review Board cleared you.
5,00:00:49,00:00:53,"It's been a rough time, but I'm dealing with it."
6,00:00:53,00:00:57,"Anyway, a kitchen worker found him."
7,00:00:57,00:00:59,Say a lot of homeless people hang out here.
8,00:00:59,00:01:03,Says the vic was unfamiliar to him.
9,00:01:03,00:01:06,"Creased khakis, Oxford shirt, new shoes."
10,00:01:06,00:01:07,This guy had a home.
11,00:01:07,00:01:10,"Well, I checked the front pockets, no ID."
12,00:01:10,00:01:12,Back pockets?
13,00:01:12,00:01:13,I was leaving that for you.
14,00:01:14,00:01:16,BRASS: Looks like some blood around his lips.
15,00:01:16,00:01:18,Maybe somebody punched him in the mouth.
16,00:01:18,00:01:19,What do you think?
17,00:01:28,00:01:30,Cranberry sauce.
18,00:01:30,00:01:33,(chuckles): I know.
19,00:01:33,00:01:34,Happy Thanksgiving.
20,00:01:58,00:02:11,Oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪Who...♪ (indistinct radio transmission)
21,00:02:12,00:02:13,(siren wails in distance)
22,00:02:13,00:02:16,WILLOWS: This place used to make a hell of a meatloaf sandwich.
23,00:02:16,00:02:17,You ever eat here?
24,00:02:17,00:02:20,GRISSOM: Not since the chef blew his brains all over the kitchen.
25,00:02:20,00:02:21,PHILLIPS: I eat here all the time.
26,00:02:22,00:02:23,I like the chili.
27,00:02:26,00:02:27,"GRISSOM: T.O.D., David?"
28,00:02:27,00:02:30,"Based on liver temp, he's been dead around two hours."
29,00:02:30,00:02:34,WILLOWS: Looks like he was knocked out and thrown out.
30,00:02:34,00:02:41,And there's some metallic silver residue on his cheek.
31,00:02:45,00:02:47,What's this gunk in his hands?
32,00:02:50,00:02:52,Mashed potatoes.
33,00:02:52,00:02:55,There were mashed potatoes in the Dumpster.
34,00:02:56,00:03:00,No fingernails... on either hand.
35,00:03:02,00:03:05,WILLOWS: Maybe he was alive inside there.
36,00:03:05,00:03:06,Digging to get out.
37,00:03:06,00:03:09,Or he had really bad table manners.
38,00:03:13,00:03:18,"There's some scarring on his wrist, but not on the other."
39,00:03:20,00:03:22,Look what I found in his pocket.
40,00:03:22,00:03:26,"""Aunt Jackpot's Pretzels."" Oh, now, they make a great pretzel."
41,00:03:26,00:03:29,Maybe that's why he's got that smile on his face.
42,00:03:34,00:03:38,(indistinct radio transmission)
43,00:03:40,00:03:43,CURTIS: 419 times two.
44,00:03:43,00:03:44,Double murder?
45,00:03:44,00:03:45,Husband and wife.
46,00:03:45,00:03:47,SIDLE: Beat-up car in a Lexus neighborhood.
47,00:03:47,00:03:49,CURTIS: We ran the plates. R.O. doesn't live here.
48,00:03:49,00:03:51,We're tracking her down.
49,00:03:51,00:03:55,"STOKES: ""Bitch on Wheels."" Can't wait to meet her."
50,00:03:57,00:04:01,Alarm was triggered at 11:45 p.m.
51,00:04:01,00:04:04,The monitoring company notified P.D.
52,00:04:04,00:04:06,when the homeowners didn't return their call.
53,00:04:06,00:04:09,Patrol finally arrived at 3:32 a.m.
54,00:04:09,00:04:11,Residentials are a low priority.
55,00:04:11,00:04:12,They're usually false alarms.
56,00:04:12,00:04:14,Not this one.
57,00:04:14,00:04:17,Michael and Lori Tinsley.
58,00:04:17,00:04:18,Kitchen door was open when we arrived.
59,00:04:18,00:04:20,His wallet was in his pocket.
60,00:04:20,00:04:23,Her purse was on the counter.
61,00:04:23,00:04:27,"Cards, cash, TV, stereo, it's all still here."
62,00:04:27,00:04:31,"STOKES: If this was a robbery, they missed all the good stuff."
63,00:04:31,00:04:32,The coroner should be here right now.
64,00:04:33,00:04:35,"So, uh, I'm gonna go see what's happened to him."
65,00:04:38,00:04:42,"Well, looks like she exsanguinated out her jugular."
66,00:04:42,00:04:45,Abrasion on his forehead.
67,00:04:45,00:04:47,No visible blood.
68,00:04:47,00:04:49,Blonde hairs on his shirt.
69,00:04:49,00:04:51,Both victims are brunette.
70,00:04:51,00:04:55,"Blonde hairs on the wife, too."
71,00:04:55,00:04:59,And possible skin scrapings under her fingernails.
72,00:05:00,00:05:02,Maybe she got a piece of her attacker.
73,00:05:02,00:05:03,(muffled scream)
74,00:05:08,00:05:11,"If her neck was sliced with a knife, it was probably serrated."
75,00:05:11,00:05:14,The wound's too jagged for a straight one.
76,00:05:16,00:05:19,SIDLE: Check out that record collection.
77,00:05:19,00:05:20,The cabinet door's open.
78,00:05:25,00:05:26,Alphabetized.
79,00:05:26,00:05:29,Classic rock.
80,00:05:31,00:05:35,Looks like several records have been removed recently.
81,00:05:42,00:05:44,I'll dust for prints.
82,00:05:44,00:05:46,Smudges in the blood trail.
83,00:05:46,00:05:50,Ovoid shapes suggest directionality.
84,00:05:50,00:05:57,Satellite stains also suggest suspect moved this direction.
85,00:05:57,00:06:01,"Judging by these gaps, I'd say entire catalogs are missing."
86,00:06:01,00:06:03,There is good money in vinyl.
87,00:06:03,00:06:06,Especially if it's rare and well-preserved.
88,00:06:06,00:06:09,Who would kill somebody over a bunch of records?
89,00:06:09,00:06:12,Something's missing between the Beach Boys and Billy Joel.
90,00:06:12,00:06:14,BOTH: The Beatles.
91,00:06:20,00:06:22,Loose strike.
92,00:06:22,00:06:25,Would have been pretty easy to get in from back here.
93,00:06:27,00:06:29,They have a dog.
94,00:06:29,00:06:32,Sofia said the door was open; maybe he took off.
95,00:06:32,00:06:35,Blood stains stop at the grass.
96,00:06:35,00:06:39,"Sprinklers are on now, kissing the evidence good-bye."
97,00:06:39,00:06:40,"Hey, Nick."
98,00:06:40,00:06:41,Yeah?
99,00:06:41,00:06:43,There was some blood on these dog bowls.
100,00:06:48,00:06:49,Considerable.

107,00:07:47,00:07:49,DR. ROBBINS: Stomach is massively distended.
108,00:07:49,00:07:52,"Human stomachs have a volume of about one liter, a little more than a quart."
109,00:07:52,00:07:56,But they have the ability to expand and hold up to four liters.
110,00:07:56,00:08:00,"But looking at this guy, I'd say he was packing around six."
111,00:08:00,00:08:01,And that's your COD.
112,00:08:01,00:08:05,(coughing)
113,00:08:05,00:08:10,Asphyxia due to mechanical compression of the lungs due to gastric dilatation.
114,00:08:10,00:08:14,"His stomach expanded, leaving no room for the organs."
115,00:08:14,00:08:17,It's going to keep me on my diet for a couple more weeks.
116,00:08:17,00:08:19,Let's take a look.
117,00:08:22,00:08:25,"Ooh, the guy was a walking buffet."
118,00:08:25,00:08:27,Multiple contusions.
119,00:08:27,00:08:30,He's got a band of dead tissue on his wrist.
120,00:08:30,00:08:33,No fingernails.
121,00:08:33,00:08:35,Cuticle's are inflamed and still intact.
122,00:08:35,00:08:36,They weren't pulled off.
123,00:08:36,00:08:37,They were bitten down...
124,00:08:39,00:08:44,"At first I thought tortured and force fed, but the usual signs of force feeding are absent."
125,00:08:44,00:08:46,No abrasions on the mucosal surface of the lips.
126,00:08:46,00:08:49,No aspirated food in the airways.
127,00:08:49,00:08:50,So what are you thinking now?
128,00:08:52,00:08:54,He ate himself to death.
129,00:08:56,00:08:59,Do you recognize this face?
130,00:09:00,00:09:01,MAN: I know exactly who that is.
131,00:09:01,00:09:03,"Man, dude's crazy."
132,00:09:03,00:09:04,Dude got a name?
133,00:09:04,00:09:05,No name.
134,00:09:05,00:09:06,"Oh, but I got a wallet."
135,00:09:06,00:09:08,"What, he left it behind?"
136,00:09:08,00:09:10,More like he threw it.
137,00:09:12,00:09:13,"Pretzel, thank you, please."
138,00:09:13,00:09:14,"Hey, pal."
139,00:09:14,00:09:15,Where's your manners?
140,00:09:15,00:09:17,"Just one pretzel, please. Just a quick, fast one."
141,00:09:18,00:09:18,"Come on. No, no."
142,00:09:19,00:09:21,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I said no!"
143,00:09:21,00:09:22,Excuse me.
144,00:09:22,00:09:25,"See, salty pretzel's $1.50."
145,00:09:25,00:09:27,Only a dollar in the wallet.
146,00:09:27,00:09:29,Jerk.
147,00:09:29,00:09:31,"Hey, and I took the money, by the way."
148,00:09:31,00:09:33,I didn't care.
149,00:09:33,00:09:34,"Oh, I saw that."
150,00:09:34,00:09:35,Sports Promotions.
151,00:09:35,00:09:38,"Man, I seen his gut, man."
152,00:09:38,00:09:39,He don't look like he no athlete.
153,00:09:39,00:09:42,They're calling poker players athletes these days.
154,00:09:42,00:09:44,Seen the guts on them?
155,00:09:44,00:09:46,"Hey, can I get a pineapple cinnamon?"
156,00:09:46,00:09:48,"Oh, okay, good choice."
157,00:09:48,00:09:50,Thank you. (Touch-Tone beeps )
158,00:09:51,00:09:52,(line ringing)
159,00:09:52,00:09:56,WOMAN: O198. Please leave your message after the tone.
160,00:09:59,00:10:04,"All right, let's take a look at our Cujo."
161,00:10:07,00:10:09,(soft whining)
162,00:10:11,00:10:14,"Yeah, she's ferocious."
163,00:10:14,00:10:16,"STOKES: Yeah, yeah, I'm petrified."
164,00:10:16,00:10:18,So what's the outside chance of rabies?
165,00:10:18,00:10:25,"She's not salivating excessively or showing any signs of hydrophobia, but rabies doesn't present immediately."
166,00:10:25,00:10:27,She'll be quarantined for the next ten days.
167,00:10:27,00:10:31,"Well, other than rabies, what would make a dog attack its owner?"
168,00:10:31,00:10:31,Abuse?
169,00:10:31,00:10:35,Abused animals may turn violent.
170,00:10:35,00:10:37,Head traumas may induce unprovoked aggression.
171,00:10:37,00:10:39,And there's always springer rage.
172,00:10:39,00:10:41,"Yeah, yeah, I hate that show, too."
173,00:10:41,00:10:43,(chuckles )
174,00:10:43,00:10:48,"It's a form of epilepsy associated with several breeds, including springers and retrievers."
175,00:10:48,00:10:51,Man's best friend will back you into a corner and attack.
176,00:10:51,00:10:54,"Five minutes later, she's licking your face as if nothing ever happened."
177,00:10:57,00:10:59,I'll suppose you want bite impressions?
178,00:10:59,00:11:01,"Yeah, I'll prep the microsil, if you prep the pooch."
179,00:11:01,00:11:05,"This car is registered to you, Ms. Halter?"
180,00:11:05,00:11:07,Yeah. So?
181,00:11:07,00:11:09,And why was it in the Tinsleys' driveway?
182,00:11:09,00:11:12,I lent it to Michael; his Beemer's in the shop.
183,00:11:12,00:11:13,I want it back.
184,00:11:13,00:11:15,This was not meant for public transit.
185,00:11:15,00:11:20,And your relationship with Michael Tinsley is?
186,00:11:20,00:11:22,Why is that any of your business?
187,00:11:23,00:11:25,"I'm his girlfriend, okay?"
188,00:11:25,00:11:27,How does his wife feel about that?
189,00:11:27,00:11:29,Not my problem.
190,00:11:29,00:11:31,"They're separated, getting divorced."
191,00:11:31,00:11:32,Michael lives with me.
192,00:11:32,00:11:35,I want to talk to Michael now.
193,00:11:35,00:11:38,Were you at Lori Tinsley's house last night?
194,00:11:38,00:11:42,No. I've never been inside that psuedo Cape Cod dump.
195,00:11:42,00:11:46,"If you've never been there, then how do you know it's a pseudo Cape Cod dump?"
196,00:11:46,00:11:48,I know her taste.
197,00:11:48,00:11:51,"Well, your fingerprints were at the scene."
198,00:11:51,00:11:54,"In fact, you helped yourself to the record collection."
199,00:11:54,00:11:56,That's why I'm here?
200,00:11:56,00:11:58,Because you think I stole some albums?
201,00:11:58,00:12:00,What did Michael tell you?
202,00:12:00,00:12:01,Not much.
203,00:12:01,00:12:05,"Look, he said Lori was planning on selling his vinyls."
204,00:12:05,00:12:13,"So, last week, when she was out and he was at work, he gave me the keys, the alarm code and a list of albums he couldn't live without."
205,00:12:17,00:12:19,(dog panting)
206,00:12:20,00:12:21,(dog yelps)
207,00:12:26,00:12:28,Michael's owned those records since high school.
208,00:12:28,00:12:31,"He has the White Album, autographed by Paul McCartney."
209,00:12:31,00:12:34,And he didn't break into the house himself because...
210,00:12:34,00:12:36,Because he needed an alibi in case Lori pressed charges.
211,00:12:36,00:12:42,"Look, I am trying to be helpful here, but I'm not saying another word until you let me talk to Michael."
212,00:12:42,00:12:48,"You have the right to remain silent, but Michael Tinsley and Lori Tinsley are dead."
213,00:12:51,00:12:52,(beep)
214,00:12:56,00:12:57,(beep)
215,00:13:39,00:13:41,"Oh, nice look."
216,00:13:41,00:13:43,That'll guarantee you the chicks.
217,00:13:43,00:13:48,Silvery material on your vic's face was Graftobian theatrical makeup.
218,00:13:48,00:13:50,Moonlight Silver is the color.
219,00:13:50,00:13:51,(laughing)
220,00:13:51,00:13:54,"Okay, look, I can't stand the smell of hot dogs."
221,00:13:54,00:13:56,They make me sick.
222,00:13:56,00:13:59,"So, all this stuff was in the vic's stomach?"
223,00:13:59,00:14:01,Among other things.
224,00:14:01,00:14:02,You know what the worst kind of burp is?
225,00:14:03,00:14:04,Hot dog burp.
226,00:14:04,00:14:08,"You know, like your dad's just letting them loose, or maybe the ex-girlfriend."
227,00:14:11,00:14:17,"Well, as you can see, he wasn't much of a chewer, which was very lucky for us."
228,00:14:17,00:14:19,Made it easier to identify the food.
229,00:14:19,00:14:24,"Cake, mac and cheese, pretzels, pasta, beef, shrimp, fish and, of course, hot dogs."
230,00:14:26,00:14:30,"Food normally takes two to four hours to digest, which means he ate all of this..."
231,00:14:30,00:14:34,In two to four hours before he died.
232,00:14:34,00:14:36,How many hot dogs did he eat?
233,00:14:36,00:14:38,Approximately 20.
234,00:14:38,00:14:40,"God, ugh."
235,00:14:40,00:14:46,Do you think we might be able to ID the makers of the hot dogs from the ingredients? No.
236,00:14:46,00:14:49,"Believe it or not, most hot dog companies are very proprietary over their recipes."
237,00:14:49,00:14:52,"Well, how about through the griddle marks?"
238,00:14:52,00:14:56,"Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just run it through the Hot Dog Appliance database."
239,00:15:00,00:15:04,When was the last time you saw a branded logo on a hot dog?
240,00:15:04,00:15:06,WILLOWS: Looks like those novelty chatter teeth.
241,00:15:07,00:15:07,Weird.
242,00:15:08,00:15:09,You think that's weird?
243,00:15:10,00:15:11,Check this out.
244,00:15:13,00:15:15,Go ahead. Dig in.
245,00:15:25,00:15:44,"WILLOWS: ""Circus Town Buffet."" ""All-U-Can-Eat."" I know exactly who that is."
246,00:15:44,00:15:46,How could I forget him?
247,00:16:00,00:16:02,"Hi, we've got a problem."
248,00:16:02,00:16:05,Hurry up before the food's gone.
249,00:16:05,00:16:06,I called Security to kick him out.
250,00:16:06,00:16:08,"When they arrived, he was gone."
251,00:16:08,00:16:09,Kick him out?
252,00:16:09,00:16:14,"Sign outside says, ""All-U-Can-Eat."" Look, he was taking it a little too far."
253,00:16:14,00:16:16,"Well, he paid, didn't he?"
254,00:16:16,00:16:17,"Yeah, cash."
255,00:16:17,00:16:19,So he still had his wallet.
256,00:16:19,00:16:21,Do you have any surveillance on your register?
257,00:16:21,00:16:23,For the $1.99 buffet?
258,00:16:23,00:16:24,That would be a no.
259,00:16:24,00:16:30,And are those the only hot dogs that you serve?
260,00:16:30,00:16:32,"Yeah, we're famous for our cocktail wieners."
261,00:16:32,00:16:33,You should try one.
262,00:16:33,00:16:36,I think we need a couple of cocktails first.
263,00:16:36,00:16:39,DNA confirmed all the blood at the crime scene is Lora Tinsley's.
264,00:16:39,00:16:41,Sofia talked to their divorce lawyers.
265,00:16:41,00:16:45,"Michael and Lori were fighting over everything-- the house, the cars, her jewelry."
266,00:16:45,00:16:48,"When she found out that he was stealing his stuff back, she had the locks and the alarm codes changed."
267,00:16:48,00:16:55,"Well, Michael did send his girlfriend Missy over to retrieve his vinyl, but last night he broke in himself, not to mention she was home."
268,00:16:55,00:16:57,"That's kind of asking for trouble, isn't it?"
269,00:16:57,00:16:59,"Yeah, divorce is war, huh?"
270,00:16:59,00:17:00,Sure glad I don't have that problem.
271,00:17:00,00:17:02,"Yeah, me either. Hodges."
272,00:17:02,00:17:04,"I'm not done with your samples, okay?"
273,00:17:04,00:17:06,And I just received the fingernail scrapings.
274,00:17:06,00:17:08,"Well, I sent the scrapings to DNA."
275,00:17:08,00:17:10,DNA kicked them over to me.
276,00:17:11,00:17:12,There were no biologicals in the sample.
277,00:17:12,00:17:14,Have you processed the hairs yet?
278,00:17:14,00:17:16,"That, I have done."
279,00:17:16,00:17:20,All the hairs lifted off the victims' clothes were consistent with each other.
280,00:17:21,00:17:22,There's a sample under the scope.
281,00:17:24,00:17:30,"Root is shaped like a spade which is indicative of canine, and the scale pattern is consistent with a golden retriever."
282,00:17:30,00:17:33,"Oh, yeah, the victims have a golden retriever."
283,00:17:33,00:17:37,"Well, if you'd cracked that mystery at the scene, you would've saved me a lot of time."
284,00:17:37,00:17:40,I've been working like a dog.
285,00:17:40,00:17:43,"You know, studies have found that pet owners have lower stress levels."
286,00:17:43,00:17:44,You should check that out.
287,00:17:44,00:17:47,"Well, I had hamsters growing up."
288,00:17:47,00:17:48,My mother hated them.
289,00:17:48,00:17:53,"She said they stank up my room, but I just loved to watch them spinning on their little wheels."
290,00:17:53,00:17:57,One day I came home and they were gone.
291,00:17:57,00:18:00,Somehow they'd gotten out of their cage.
292,00:18:00,00:18:02,How much did your mother hate them?
293,00:18:02,00:18:04,They ran away.
294,00:18:49,00:18:50,(beep)
295,00:18:57,00:18:58,(beep)
296,00:19:01,00:19:04,(saw buzzing)
297,00:19:25,00:19:27,(clink)
298,00:19:29,00:19:31,Michael Tinsley was shot?
299,00:19:31,00:19:35,"Yeah, the bullet penetrated the base of the brain and lodged in the occipital lobe."
300,00:19:35,00:19:37,The hemorrhage was intracranial.
301,00:19:37,00:19:39,Looks like a .22 caliber.
302,00:19:39,00:19:42,"Yeah, the scalp abrasion was probably incidental."
303,00:19:42,00:19:46,We did not check the house for GSR; we didn't know he was shot.
304,00:19:46,00:19:50,That's understandable-- the entry wound wasn't visible-- but check this out.
305,00:19:54,00:19:57,Some people will put anything up their nose.
306,00:19:58,00:20:05,"So, Michael Tinsley breaks into his own house, the alarm goes off, all hell breaks loose."
307,00:20:05,00:20:09,"She shoots him, the bullet goes up his nose, and then what?"
308,00:20:09,00:20:12,Kahlua freaks and rips out the wife's throat?
309,00:20:12,00:20:16,"It's possible, which is another reason I prefer cats."
310,00:20:16,00:20:19,The Tinsleys died at home... alone.
311,00:20:19,00:20:22,"So, where's the gun?"
312,00:20:30,00:20:32,I went shopping.
313,00:20:32,00:20:35,Bought every brand of hot dog for sale in Las Vegas.
314,00:20:35,00:20:36,Who's paying for it?
315,00:20:36,00:20:38,You mean the lab's not going to reimburse me?
316,00:20:39,00:20:40,No.
317,00:20:40,00:20:48,"Well, I couldn't identify the chatter teeth logo, so I figured I could physically match one of these to the one found in the victim's stomach, you know?"
318,00:20:48,00:20:51,Maybe comparing that twisty thing at the end.
319,00:20:51,00:20:53,"Sounds like a good idea, Greg."
320,00:20:53,00:20:55,I'm still not paying for it.
321,00:20:55,00:20:58,Fine-- guess I'll just eat hot dogs for the rest of the year.
322,00:20:58,00:21:05,"""A hot dog at the ballpark tastes better than a steak at the Ritz."" Well, I can tell when you're quoting something."
323,00:21:05,00:21:06,Who said it?
324,00:21:06,00:21:07,Humphrey Bogart.
325,00:21:07,00:21:08,Mm.
326,00:21:08,00:21:11,"Did you know that the term ""hot dog"" was actually coined at a baseball game?"
327,00:21:11,00:21:16,"New York Polo Grounds, somewhere around 1867."
328,00:21:16,00:21:20,"A German butcher was selling what he called ""dachshund sausages"" out of his pie wagon."
329,00:21:20,00:21:23,"He put them on a roll, so that his customers wouldn't burn their fingers."
330,00:21:24,00:21:31,"He'd yell out ""Get your dachshund sausages, they're red hot!"" Soon, all the vendors at the Polo Grounds were selling them, too."
331,00:21:31,00:21:38,"But they were too lazy to say ""dachshund sausages,"" so they just called them ""hot dogs."" Now there's over 50 major brands."
332,00:21:38,00:21:40,Good luck. I'm rooting for you.
333,00:21:40,00:21:43,"Well, hopefully I find a wiener."
334,00:22:25,00:22:26,"EMCEE: Gut check, one, two!"
335,00:22:26,00:22:28,Gut check!
336,00:22:28,00:22:30,Ladies and gentlemen!
337,00:22:30,00:22:32,Time for the bib sheets.
338,00:22:33,00:22:36,Today's match will include some of the most famous gurgitators in the sport.
339,00:22:36,00:22:43,"Let's start with one of the finest: The godfather of the sport has a mouth so big he speaks in Surround Sound, ladies and gentlemen."
340,00:22:43,00:22:49,Three-time lasagna-eating champion Antonio Colletti.
341,00:22:49,00:22:53,"Patty Cake, Patty Cake, baker's man, she can eat a cake faster than anyone can."
342,00:22:53,00:22:59,"Current cupcake champion and the most elegant eater in the sport, Patty Cake Newton."
343,00:22:59,00:23:01,Our most vocal gurgitator...
344,00:23:01,00:23:04,There's the chatter teeth logo.
345,00:23:04,00:23:06,BRASS: E.X.E.F.
346,00:23:06,00:23:10,Wasn't that the name on the business card you found in the vic's wallet?
347,00:23:10,00:23:13,I think we just found our Digger James.
348,00:23:13,00:23:15,...he's said to have two stomachs!
349,00:23:15,00:23:21,"Undisputed popcorn shrimp champion, James ""Spare Tank"" Patterson."
350,00:23:21,00:23:23,(belches loudly)
351,00:23:23,00:23:40,"And finally, known for his jaw strength, trains with his pit bulls, three-time rib champion-- today he will be wearing the E.X.E.F. hot dog camera-- Marty Mayron, ""The Meat Machine!"" (crowd cheering)"
352,00:23:40,00:23:47,"All right, gurgitators, you have 12 minutes to eat your way into history."
353,00:23:47,00:23:49,They're diving straight in there.
354,00:23:49,00:23:58,"Marty Mayron going with the Japanese, dipping his bun in lemonade to make it go down easier and then biting that hot dog into little pieces."
355,00:23:58,00:24:02,"Not to be outdone, Miomoto going for the double Japanese."
356,00:24:02,00:24:06,"Colletti, the old pro, double fisting it, double dunking it."
357,00:24:06,00:24:08,That is a Heimlich waiting to happen.
358,00:24:08,00:24:12,"...is not fooling around-- he's doing a reverse Japanese: Bun first, hot dog afterwards."
359,00:24:12,00:24:21,"Sort of a ""dachshund chaser."" Still pushing it, going old school, like a little kid trying to impress his grandmother at Thanksgiving dinner."
360,00:24:21,00:24:25,Patty Cake going mostly cakey on that one.
361,00:24:25,00:24:28,You can almost see the icing on that hot dog.
362,00:24:28,00:24:29,Colletti having a bit of a problem.
363,00:24:29,00:24:31,Something's slowing him down.
364,00:24:31,00:24:32,Whoa!
365,00:24:32,00:24:36,"Antonio Colletti, a reversal of fortune."
366,00:24:36,00:24:41,"That's an immediate disqualification, and, of course, disgusting for all of us to watch."
367,00:24:42,00:24:44,Wow.
368,00:24:44,00:24:45,"Well, which one do you want?"
369,00:24:45,00:24:49,The guy in the silver face paint or Digger James?
370,00:24:49,00:24:51,I don't know-- slimy stuff is your thing.
371,00:24:51,00:24:52,I don't want to get mustard on my suit.
372,00:24:53,00:24:53,I'll take Digger.
373,00:24:54,00:24:56,Do I have a choice?
374,00:24:56,00:24:58,(cheering)
375,00:24:59,00:25:01,"BRASS: Hey, you recognize this guy?"
376,00:25:01,00:25:02,DIGGER JAMES: That's Jerry.
377,00:25:02,00:25:05,"By far, one of the best walk-on gurgitators I've ever seen."
378,00:25:05,00:25:08,"So you gave him your business card, right?"
379,00:25:08,00:25:10,I'm the U.S. rep for the E.X.E.F.
380,00:25:10,00:25:14,"All right, E.X.E.F.-- what exactly does that stand for?"
381,00:25:14,00:25:16,It's the Extreme Eating Federation.
382,00:25:16,00:25:18,We're one of the most popular leagues in the sport.
383,00:25:18,00:25:20,"Pounding down hot dogs, that's a sport?"
384,00:25:20,00:25:22,Since the early days of man.
385,00:25:22,00:25:27,"You got 30 Neanderthals in a cave and a rabbit walks in, you have a competitive eating situation, my friend."
386,00:25:27,00:25:29,"We have rules, records, prize money."
387,00:25:29,00:25:32,Some of our top competitors earn up to a half a million dollars a year.
388,00:25:33,00:25:33,We're on cable.
389,00:25:34,00:25:35,No kidding.
390,00:25:35,00:25:37,"Well, what does all this have to do with Jerry?"
391,00:25:37,00:25:39,Everything.
392,00:25:39,00:25:41,Jerry had undeniable gastro-intestinal fortitude.
393,00:25:41,00:25:44,He took third in yesterday's competition.
394,00:25:44,00:25:46,That qualifies him for the finals in Atlantic City.
395,00:25:46,00:25:48,It made the Las VegasPost. Hm.
396,00:25:48,00:25:50,Sports section.
397,00:25:54,00:25:57,"(cheering, whooping, applause)"
398,00:26:12,00:26:14,Can I keep this?
399,00:26:14,00:26:15,Sure. Thanks.
400,00:26:16,00:26:19,"I'm telling you, with proper training, Jerry could've proudly represented the U.S."
401,00:26:19,00:26:22,and taken back the Golden Weenie from the Japanese Champion.
402,00:26:22,00:26:24,"Yeah, got to get that Golden Weenie back."
403,00:26:24,00:26:27,"Uh, so after the tournament, did you see Jerry?"
404,00:26:27,00:26:30,"Paid him, gave him my card, left him to celebrate."
405,00:26:31,00:26:33,Any idea who he was celebrating with?
406,00:26:34,00:26:35,You want a sample of my face paint?
407,00:26:35,00:26:38,"Yeah, it's part of my investigation."
408,00:26:39,00:26:41,"Oh, it's still moist."
409,00:26:41,00:26:42,That's good for me.
410,00:26:42,00:26:45,I didn't do anything to Jerry Gable.
411,00:26:45,00:26:51,"Okay, in the beginning, I admit I was a little pee'd off that I lost to the guy."
412,00:26:51,00:26:55,But then I learned what a disturbed individual he was.
413,00:26:55,00:26:56,Couple more!
414,00:26:56,00:26:59,"Just, just, just, just, a couple... couple more!"
415,00:26:59,00:27:02,Has anybody got more hot dogs?
416,00:27:02,00:27:03,(shrieks) Please!
417,00:27:03,00:27:05,"What are you trying to prove, huh?"
418,00:27:05,00:27:06,Just give me more!
419,00:27:06,00:27:08,"Trying to be a big guy, tough guy, huh?"
420,00:27:08,00:27:11,"Please, please! (whimpering, crying)"
421,00:27:13,00:27:16,And what happened after the friendly hug?
422,00:27:17,00:27:19,"Some guy in a hat came by, took him out of here."
423,00:27:21,00:27:23,Is that the guy in the hat?
424,00:27:24,00:27:26,Sure is.
425,00:27:48,00:27:49,(dog barks)
426,00:28:51,00:28:53,So I found the murder weapon.
427,00:28:54,00:28:58,It slipped under the living room couch-- presumably when Kahlua attacked Lori.
428,00:28:58,00:29:01,"Well, a dog did attack Lori, but it wasn't Kahlua."
429,00:29:01,00:29:05,The bite marks on Lori's neck are inconsistent with Kahlua's teeth.
430,00:29:05,00:29:07,"Oh, which means Kahlua gets to walk."
431,00:29:07,00:29:11,Check out this left canine.
432,00:29:13,00:29:15,SIDLE: The tooth is chipped.
433,00:29:15,00:29:22,"All the dog hair we found at the crime scene was consistent with a golden retriever, which suggests there was another golden retriever in the house."
434,00:29:22,00:29:25,"It could've attacked Lori, fled out the kitchen door."
435,00:29:25,00:29:31,"That is like saying there's a second shooter on the grassy knoll-- they only had one dog, Nick."
436,00:29:31,00:29:32,I'm calling Animal Control.
437,00:29:32,00:29:37,"We're looking for another golden retriever, one with a bad tooth and rotten disposition."
438,00:29:48,00:29:50,Little late to be going to court.
439,00:29:50,00:29:52,"No, I'm not going to court."
440,00:29:52,00:29:57,I'm taking my lady Tina to that new Cirque show at the Wynn and I forgot my tickets in my locker.
441,00:29:57,00:30:01,"That's nice, but if you're looking for something to tide you over, look no further."
442,00:30:05,00:30:07,Busy night.
443,00:30:07,00:30:10,Figured the lab could use a little lovin' from the oven.
444,00:30:10,00:30:12,"Oh, your wife made a pie."
445,00:30:12,00:30:14,I made the pie.
446,00:30:14,00:30:17,Strawberry rhubarb.
447,00:30:17,00:30:19,I'm impressed.
448,00:30:21,00:30:26,"Let's take it easy with the cutting there, Doc, it's starting to look like the hit-and-run on your table last week."
449,00:30:26,00:30:27,Just try it.
450,00:30:27,00:30:28,Thanks.
451,00:30:28,00:30:29,"You know, it's vegan."
452,00:30:29,00:30:32,"Low fat, low sugar, low carb."
453,00:30:32,00:30:34,Low taste.
454,00:30:35,00:30:36,"Catherine, Catherine, come here."
455,00:30:36,00:30:38,I need your opinion on this.
456,00:30:42,00:30:44,Try this.
457,00:30:44,00:30:47,"No, thank you, I just came from Nel's Hot Dog Eating Tournament."
458,00:30:47,00:30:50,I'm really done with food. It's good.
459,00:30:50,00:30:51,I was watching that on cable.
460,00:30:51,00:30:56,"Some Japanese guy ate, like, 64 hot dogs in 12 minutes. Yeah."
461,00:30:56,00:30:58,He's was the most famous guy in Japan behind Yao Ming.
462,00:30:58,00:31:00,Yao Ming is Chinese. Try it.
463,00:31:00,00:31:02,They ought to make it an Olympic sport or something.
464,00:31:02,00:31:04,Please?
465,00:31:04,00:31:05,"No, I can't go there. I can't."
466,00:31:05,00:31:10,"You know, if you want to cleanse your taste buds, I suggest you try Doc Robbins' pie."
467,00:31:10,00:31:11,Really.
468,00:31:11,00:31:13,"Yeah, that's why you're leaving it behind."
469,00:31:18,00:31:21,I got an ID on Dumpster guy.
470,00:31:21,00:31:23,Brass is tracking down a current address.
471,00:31:23,00:31:25,Prader-Willi.
472,00:31:25,00:31:27,"No, his name was Jerry Gable."
473,00:31:27,00:31:30,"No, Prader-Willi Syndrome."
474,00:31:30,00:31:35,"A rare gentic disorder that causes ceaseless, uncontrollable excruciating hunger."
475,00:31:35,00:31:38,It's as if your stomach was truly a bottomless pit.
476,00:31:38,00:31:44,"That could explain why after consuming 22 dogs, he wanted more."
477,00:31:44,00:31:46,Could also explain why he was found in the Dumpster.
478,00:31:46,00:31:48,He followed the food.
479,00:31:48,00:31:55,"Prader-Willi Syndrome is characterized by short stature, hypotonia, almond-shaped eyes, and obsessive fingernail biting."
480,00:31:55,00:31:57,That kind of fits the victim's description.
481,00:31:57,00:32:00,Sufferers are born with a flawed hypothalamus.
482,00:32:00,00:32:06,"Normal hypothalamus receives a signal from the stomach-- ""I'm full, stop eating."" (cheering)"
483,00:32:11,00:32:16,"GRISSOM: But with Prader-Willi Syndrome, the signal never reaches the brain."
484,00:32:28,00:32:30,They're always hungry.
485,00:32:30,00:32:33,"Like having a full tank of gas, and gauge is stuck on empty."
486,00:32:33,00:32:36,Guy's like Jerry are monitored their whole lives.
487,00:32:36,00:32:39,Constant supervision 24 hours a day.
488,00:32:39,00:32:42,You remember the scar tissue we found on his wrist?
489,00:32:46,00:32:49,(grunting and groaning)
490,00:32:49,00:32:53,I think it's possible that our vic spent most of his life in restraints.
491,00:32:53,00:32:55,So either he escaped or...
492,00:32:56,00:32:58,someone set him free.
493,00:32:58,00:33:01,"In which case, they'd be responsible for his death."
494,00:33:01,00:33:03,I heard your case has gone to the dogs.
495,00:33:03,00:33:05,"Oh, Hodges, heel."
496,00:33:05,00:33:07,"No, better yet, play dead, man."
497,00:33:07,00:33:09,"Play nice, I'm throwing you a bone."
498,00:33:09,00:33:13,The fingernail scrapings from your female vic was baking grease.
499,00:33:13,00:33:15,How does that fit in the puzzle?
500,00:33:20,00:33:22,Hey.
501,00:33:22,00:33:28,"According to the court records, the Tinsleys weren't just fighting over property, they were also engaged in an expensive custody battle."
502,00:33:28,00:33:29,Custody over what?
503,00:33:29,00:33:31,They didn't have any kids.
504,00:33:31,00:33:32,They had Kahlua.
505,00:33:34,00:33:40,"And evidentally, yesterday both parties agreed to let the dog decide for herself."
506,00:33:40,00:33:44,"According to Michael's girlfriend, the dog was his, but Kahlua chose Lori."
507,00:33:44,00:33:46,"MICHAEL: Kahlua, come."
508,00:33:46,00:33:47,"Kahlua, come. Come here."
509,00:33:47,00:33:49,(clapping): Come. Come here.
510,00:33:49,00:33:50,"Kahlua, come. Come."
511,00:33:50,00:33:51,Come. Kahlua.
512,00:33:55,00:33:57,I think I know why.
513,00:33:58,00:34:01,Lori greased up before the big face-off.
514,00:34:03,00:34:04,"Kahlua, come."
515,00:34:04,00:34:06,"LORI: Come, Kahlua."
516,00:34:06,00:34:07,"Kahlua, Kahlua, come."
517,00:34:07,00:34:08,"MICHAEL: Come, come here."
518,00:34:08,00:34:10,"Kahlua, come here."
519,00:34:10,00:34:11,Come.
520,00:34:14,00:34:18,A dog's sense of smell is 25 times more sensitive than humans.
521,00:34:18,00:34:21,Bacon grease would've been pretty irresistible.
522,00:34:21,00:34:22,Question is...
523,00:34:23,00:34:27,"""Did Michael know that Lori was playing dirty?"" (cell phone rings)"
524,00:34:27,00:34:29,Stokes.
525,00:34:30,00:34:31,"Yeah, all right, cool."
526,00:34:33,00:34:36,Our suspect is in custody.
527,00:34:38,00:34:43,"MENKEN: Animal control picked her up near Centennial Park, called the number on the tag, left a voice mail."
528,00:34:43,00:34:45,Dead people don't return calls.
529,00:34:45,00:34:48,"New collar, new tags."
530,00:34:48,00:34:49,Kahlua. Same name.
531,00:34:49,00:34:51,Spoke to Animal Control.
532,00:34:51,00:34:54,Kahlua number two was adopted the same day as the murder.
533,00:34:54,00:34:55,You want to guess the adopter's name?
534,00:34:55,00:34:57,Michael Tinsley.
535,00:34:57,00:34:59,You bet.
536,00:34:59,00:35:00,He adopted Kahlua's doppelganger.
537,00:35:01,00:35:04,Left tooth is chipped. Confirm's ID.
538,00:35:04,00:35:06,She doesn't seem very ferocious.
539,00:35:06,00:35:07,You want to see ferocious?
540,00:35:07,00:35:09,Yeah.
541,00:35:18,00:35:20,(barking)
542,00:35:22,00:35:24,(barking)
543,00:35:24,00:35:26,How did you know?
544,00:35:26,00:35:30,"When the guys loaded her up into the Animal Control van, they slammed the door and she went off."
545,00:35:30,00:35:31,So the gun acted as a trigger.
546,00:35:31,00:35:33,She heard it and attacked Lori.
547,00:35:33,00:35:35,MENKEN: Probably abused in the past.
548,00:35:35,00:35:38,"If they'd known, they never would've put her up for adoption."
549,00:35:38,00:35:43,"Michael broke into the house intending to swap dogs, hoping that Lori wouldn't even notice the difference."
550,00:35:43,00:35:45,(doorknob rattling )
551,00:35:51,00:35:55,(alarm blaring)
552,00:35:55,00:35:56,You don't give a damn about Kahlua!
553,00:35:57,00:35:58,You just don't want me to have her!
554,00:35:58,00:36:00,You care more about that stupid dog than you did me!
555,00:36:00,00:36:01,For once you got it right!
556,00:36:02,00:36:05,(alarm blaring)
557,00:36:06,00:36:08,(gunshot)
558,00:36:08,00:36:10,(snarling)
559,00:36:16,00:36:21,"When Kahlua number two took off, Kahlua number one came out of hiding."
560,00:36:30,00:36:33,(whining)
561,00:36:33,00:36:36,"The police showed up, she got scared , went back to her closet."
562,00:36:36,00:36:40,"Their marriage ended in a dog fight, and only the dog survived."
563,00:36:40,00:36:43,BRASS: So I called about a dozen Jerry Gables.
564,00:36:43,00:36:47,One had an answering machine for Jerry and Suzie Gable.
565,00:36:47,00:36:50,This apartment is listed to Jerry and Suzie Gable.
566,00:36:50,00:36:52,Here's Suzie.
567,00:36:52,00:36:54,(knocking) Las Vegas Police.
568,00:36:58,00:37:00,Please tell me you found Jerry.
569,00:37:15,00:37:18,"Okay, so who are you?"
570,00:37:18,00:37:20,I'm Susie's boyfriend.
571,00:37:20,00:37:23,"All right, Susie's boyfriend, what's your name?"
572,00:37:23,00:37:25,"Look, I don't have anything else to say."
573,00:37:25,00:37:27,"Hey, that's my easiest question."
574,00:37:27,00:37:33,"Hey, you don't want to give us your name, fine, but you better explain why Jerry's not in this chair."
575,00:37:35,00:37:39,"All right, look, I'm going to print this restraint."
576,00:37:39,00:37:44,"And when I find your fingerprints all over it, I won't need to ask you again."
577,00:37:44,00:37:46,"Okay, okay, all right."
578,00:37:47,00:37:49,He escaped.
579,00:37:49,00:37:55,"All right? I was supposed to be watching him, and I conked out for a second, and by the time I got up, he was gone from his chair."
580,00:37:55,00:37:56,He escaped?
581,00:37:56,00:37:58,"So, what, the guy's Houdini?"
582,00:37:58,00:38:00,Trust me.
583,00:38:00,00:38:02,"He may have been slow, but he was manipulative."
584,00:38:02,00:38:03,Yeah.
585,00:38:03,00:38:09,"Look, how do you deny a 30-year-old man food?"
586,00:38:10,00:38:13,"I mean, I felt like I was torturing the poor guy."
587,00:38:13,00:38:16,"Yeah, I told you them Vikings suck."
588,00:38:16,00:38:20,"All right, I'll meet you at the Circus Town book."
589,00:38:20,00:38:24,Can I go to Circus Town with you?
590,00:38:24,00:38:26,I heard the buffet there is yummy.
591,00:38:26,00:38:28,No.
592,00:38:28,00:38:33,(indistinct TV audio)
593,00:38:37,00:38:41,My plan was just to drop him off at the buffet while I went back to the sports book.
594,00:38:41,00:38:47,"By the time I got back... oh, man..."
595,00:38:47,00:38:49,Hey! (glass clinking)
596,00:39:04,00:39:06,I couldn't help myself.
597,00:39:06,00:39:08,I had to sign him up.
598,00:39:09,00:39:12,So let me guess-- you blew his winnings at the sports book?
599,00:39:12,00:39:14,"Well, what was he gonna do with them?"
600,00:39:14,00:39:17,He's been strapped to a damn chair his whole life.
601,00:39:17,00:39:21,"You know, you managed to supersize a combo of two deadly sins-- greed and gluttony."
602,00:39:21,00:39:24,Shame on you.
603,00:39:24,00:39:26,So what's he doing in a dumpster?
604,00:39:26,00:39:29,"I don't know, was there food in the dumpster?"
605,00:39:29,00:39:32,"'Cause when we were on our way home, Jerry was still hungry."
606,00:39:32,00:39:34,Wanted to hit up Krispy Kreme.
607,00:39:34,00:39:39,"And by the time I could tell him no, he was running off down the street."
608,00:39:39,00:39:41,I looked for him all night.
609,00:39:41,00:39:44,Yeah? Where's Susie?
610,00:39:48,00:39:51,I knew I shouldn't have left Jerry with my boyfriend.
611,00:39:51,00:39:53,I'd been calling to check in.
612,00:39:53,00:39:54,He wasn't answering.
613,00:39:54,00:39:56,I could tell something was up.
614,00:39:56,00:40:00,Why did you leave your brother with somebody you didn't trust?
615,00:40:00,00:40:02,There was no one else.
616,00:40:02,00:40:07,I had to get this surgery today or my insurance wasn't going to cover it.
617,00:40:07,00:40:10,Couldn't you have left him with a family member?
618,00:40:10,00:40:12,We have no family.
619,00:40:12,00:40:17,Our parents died in a car crash years ago.
620,00:40:17,00:40:21,What about some kind of professional help?
621,00:40:21,00:40:23,"I'm a waitress, Miss."
622,00:40:23,00:40:27,I... I don't make much.
623,00:40:27,00:40:33,"There's a really nice institution in Summerlin, but it costs a $100,000 a year."
624,00:40:34,00:40:41,"And the last babysitter I hired, Jerry beat up trying to get to the fridge."
625,00:40:43,00:40:46,"I swear to you, I really tried to take care of my brother."
626,00:40:46,00:40:50,I really... did the best I could.
627,00:41:11,00:41:13,(chuckles)
628,00:41:21,00:41:23,Jerry took third place?
629,00:41:23,00:41:25,Yeah.
630,00:41:27,00:41:29,I bet he had the time of his life.
