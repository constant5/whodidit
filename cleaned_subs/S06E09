0	00:00:46	00:00:47	Hey.
1	00:00:47	00:00:49	I was happy to hear the Review Board cleared you.
2	00:00:49	00:00:53	It's been a rough time, but I'm dealing with it.
3	00:00:53	00:00:57	Anyway, a kitchen worker found him.
4	00:00:57	00:00:59	Say a lot of homeless people hang out here.
5	00:00:59	00:01:03	Says the vic was unfamiliar to him.
6	00:01:03	00:01:06	Creased khakis, Oxford shirt, new shoes.
7	00:01:06	00:01:07	This guy had a home.
8	00:01:07	00:01:10	Well, I checked the front pockets, no ID.
9	00:01:10	00:01:12	Back pockets?
10	00:01:12	00:01:13	I was leaving that for you.
11	00:01:14	00:01:16	Looks like some blood around his lips.
12	00:01:16	00:01:18	Maybe somebody punched him in the mouth.
13	00:01:18	00:01:19	What do you think?
14	00:01:28	00:01:30	Cranberry sauce.
15	00:01:30	00:01:33	I know.
16	00:01:33	00:01:34	Happy Thanksgiving.
17	00:01:58	00:02:16	Oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Who... ♪ This place used to make a hell of a meatloaf sandwich.
18	00:02:16	00:02:17	You ever eat here?
19	00:02:17	00:02:20	Not since the chef blew his brains all over the kitchen.
20	00:02:20	00:02:21	I eat here all the time.
21	00:02:22	00:02:23	I like the chili.
22	00:02:26	00:02:27	T.O.D., David?
23	00:02:27	00:02:30	Based on liver temp, he's been dead around two hours.
24	00:02:30	00:02:34	Looks like he was knocked out and thrown out.
25	00:02:34	00:02:41	And there's some metallic silver residue on his cheek.
26	00:02:45	00:02:47	What's this gunk in his hands?
27	00:02:50	00:02:52	Mashed potatoes.
28	00:02:52	00:02:55	There were mashed potatoes in the Dumpster.
29	00:02:56	00:03:00	No fingernails... on either hand.
30	00:03:02	00:03:05	Maybe he was alive inside there.
31	00:03:05	00:03:06	Digging to get out.
32	00:03:06	00:03:09	Or he had really bad table manners.
33	00:03:13	00:03:18	There's some scarring on his wrist, but not on the other.
34	00:03:20	00:03:22	Look what I found in his pocket.
35	00:03:22	00:03:24	Aunt Jackpot's Pretzels.
36	00:03:24	00:03:26	Oh, now, they make a great pretzel.
37	00:03:26	00:03:29	Maybe that's why he's got that smile on his face.
38	00:03:40	00:03:43	419 times two.
39	00:03:43	00:03:44	Double murder?
40	00:03:44	00:03:45	Husband and wife.
41	00:03:45	00:03:47	Beat-up car in a Lexus neighborhood.
42	00:03:47	00:03:49	We ran the plates. R.O. doesn't live here.
43	00:03:49	00:03:51	We're tracking her down.
44	00:03:51	00:03:52	Bitch on Wheels.
45	00:03:52	00:03:55	Can't wait to meet her.
46	00:03:57	00:04:01	45 p.m.
47	00:04:01	00:04:04	The monitoring company notified P.D.
48	00:04:04	00:04:06	when the homeowners didn't return their call.
49	00:04:06	00:04:09	32 a.m.
50	00:04:09	00:04:11	Residentials are a low priority.
51	00:04:11	00:04:12	They're usually false alarms.
52	00:04:12	00:04:14	Not this one.
53	00:04:14	00:04:17	Michael and Lori Tinsley.
54	00:04:17	00:04:18	Kitchen door was open when we arrived.
55	00:04:18	00:04:20	His wallet was in his pocket.
56	00:04:20	00:04:23	Her purse was on the counter.
57	00:04:23	00:04:27	Cards, cash, TV, stereo, it's all still here.
58	00:04:27	00:04:31	If this was a robbery, they missed all the good stuff.
59	00:04:31	00:04:32	The coroner should be here right now.
60	00:04:33	00:04:35	So, uh, I'm gonna go see what's happened to him.
61	00:04:38	00:04:42	Well, looks like she exsanguinated out her jugular.
62	00:04:42	00:04:45	Abrasion on his forehead.
63	00:04:45	00:04:47	No visible blood.
64	00:04:47	00:04:49	Blonde hairs on his shirt.
65	00:04:49	00:04:51	Both victims are brunette.
66	00:04:51	00:04:55	Blonde hairs on the wife, too.
67	00:04:55	00:04:59	And possible skin scrapings under her fingernails.
68	00:05:00	00:05:02	Maybe she got a piece of her attacker.
69	00:05:08	00:05:11	If her neck was sliced with a knife, it was probably serrated.
70	00:05:11	00:05:14	The wound's too jagged for a straight one.
71	00:05:16	00:05:19	Check out that record collection.
72	00:05:19	00:05:20	The cabinet door's open.
73	00:05:25	00:05:26	Alphabetized.
74	00:05:26	00:05:29	Classic rock.
75	00:05:31	00:05:35	Looks like several records have been removed recently.
76	00:05:42	00:05:44	I'll dust for prints.
77	00:05:44	00:05:46	Smudges in the blood trail.
78	00:05:46	00:05:50	Ovoid shapes suggest directionality.
79	00:05:50	00:05:57	Satellite stains also suggest suspect moved this direction.
80	00:05:57	00:06:01	Judging by these gaps, I'd say entire catalogs are missing.
81	00:06:01	00:06:03	There is good money in vinyl.
82	00:06:03	00:06:06	Especially if it's rare and well-preserved.
83	00:06:06	00:06:09	Who would kill somebody over a bunch of records?
84	00:06:09	00:06:12	Something's missing between the Beach Boys and Billy Joel.
85	00:06:12	00:06:14	The Beatles.
86	00:06:20	00:06:22	Loose strike.
87	00:06:22	00:06:25	Would have been pretty easy to get in from back here.
88	00:06:27	00:06:29	They have a dog.
89	00:06:29	00:06:32	Sofia said the door was open; maybe he took off.
90	00:06:32	00:06:35	Blood stains stop at the grass.
91	00:06:35	00:06:39	Sprinklers are on now, kissing the evidence good-bye.
92	00:06:39	00:06:40	Hey, Nick.
93	00:06:40	00:06:41	Yeah?
94	00:06:41	00:06:43	There was some blood on these dog bowls.
95	00:06:48	00:06:49	Considerable.
96	00:07:44	00:07:46	I'll call Animal Control.
97	00:07:47	00:07:49	Stomach is massively distended.
98	00:07:49	00:07:52	Human stomachs have a volume of about one liter, a little more than a quart.
99	00:07:52	00:07:56	But they have the ability to expand and hold up to four liters.
100	00:07:56	00:08:00	But looking at this guy, I'd say he was packing around six.
101	00:08:00	00:08:01	And that's your COD.
102	00:08:05	00:08:10	Asphyxia due to mechanical compression of the lungs due to gastric dilatation.
103	00:08:10	00:08:14	His stomach expanded, leaving no room for the organs.
104	00:08:14	00:08:17	It's going to keep me on my diet for a couple more weeks.
105	00:08:17	00:08:19	Let's take a look.
106	00:08:22	00:08:25	Ooh, the guy was a walking buffet.
107	00:08:25	00:08:27	Multiple contusions.
108	00:08:27	00:08:30	He's got a band of dead tissue on his wrist.
109	00:08:30	00:08:33	No fingernails.
110	00:08:33	00:08:35	Cuticle's are inflamed and still intact.
111	00:08:35	00:08:36	They weren't pulled off.
112	00:08:36	00:08:37	They were bitten down...
113	00:08:39	00:08:44	At first I thought tortured and force fed, but the usual signs of force feeding are absent.
114	00:08:44	00:08:46	No abrasions on the mucosal surface of the lips.
115	00:08:46	00:08:49	No aspirated food in the airways.
116	00:08:49	00:08:50	So what are you thinking now?
117	00:08:52	00:08:54	He ate himself to death.
118	00:08:56	00:08:59	Do you recognize this face?
119	00:09:00	00:09:01	I know exactly who that is.
120	00:09:01	00:09:03	Man, dude's crazy.
121	00:09:03	00:09:04	Dude got a name?
122	00:09:04	00:09:05	No name.
123	00:09:05	00:09:06	Oh, but I got a wallet.
124	00:09:06	00:09:08	What, he left it behind?
125	00:09:08	00:09:10	More like he threw it.
126	00:09:12	00:09:13	Pretzel, thank you, please.
127	00:09:13	00:09:14	Hey, pal.
128	00:09:14	00:09:15	Where's your manners?
129	00:09:15	00:09:17	Just one pretzel, please. Just a quick, fast one.
130	00:09:18	00:09:18	Come on. No, no.
131	00:09:19	00:09:21	Hey, hey, hey, hey! I said no!
132	00:09:21	00:09:22	Excuse me.
133	00:09:22	00:09:25	See, salty pretzel's $1.50.
134	00:09:25	00:09:27	Only a dollar in the wallet.
135	00:09:27	00:09:29	Jerk.
136	00:09:29	00:09:31	Hey, and I took the money, by the way.
137	00:09:31	00:09:33	I didn't care.
138	00:09:33	00:09:34	Oh, I saw that.
139	00:09:34	00:09:35	Sports Promotions.
140	00:09:35	00:09:38	Man, I seen his gut, man.
141	00:09:38	00:09:39	He don't look like he no athlete.
142	00:09:39	00:09:42	They're calling poker players athletes these days.
143	00:09:42	00:09:44	Seen the guts on them?
144	00:09:44	00:09:46	Hey, can I get a pineapple cinnamon?
145	00:09:46	00:09:48	Oh, okay, good choice.
146	00:09:48	00:09:50	Thank you. ( Touch-Tone beeps )
147	00:09:52	00:09:56	O198. Please leave your message after the tone.
148	00:09:59	00:10:04	All right, let's take a look at our Cujo.
149	00:10:11	00:10:14	Yeah, she's ferocious.
150	00:10:14	00:10:16	Yeah, yeah, I'm petrified.
151	00:10:16	00:10:18	So what's the outside chance of rabies?
152	00:10:18	00:10:25	She's not salivating excessively or showing any signs of hydrophobia, but rabies doesn't present immediately.
153	00:10:25	00:10:27	She'll be quarantined for the next ten days.
154	00:10:27	00:10:31	Well, other than rabies, what would make a dog attack its owner?
155	00:10:31	00:10:31	Abuse?
156	00:10:31	00:10:35	Abused animals may turn violent.
157	00:10:35	00:10:37	Head traumas may induce unprovoked aggression.
158	00:10:37	00:10:39	And there's always springer rage.
159	00:10:39	00:10:41	Yeah, yeah, I hate that show, too.
160	00:10:43	00:10:48	It's a form of epilepsy associated with several breeds, including springers and retrievers.
161	00:10:48	00:10:51	Man's best friend will back you into a corner and attack.
162	00:10:51	00:10:54	Five minutes later, she's licking your face as if nothing ever happened.
163	00:10:57	00:10:59	I'll suppose you want bite impressions?
164	00:10:59	00:11:01	Yeah, I'll prep the microsil, if you prep the pooch.
165	00:11:01	00:11:05	This car is registered to you, Ms. Halter?
166	00:11:05	00:11:07	Yeah. So?
167	00:11:07	00:11:09	And why was it in the Tinsleys' driveway?
168	00:11:09	00:11:12	I lent it to Michael; his Beemer's in the shop.
169	00:11:12	00:11:13	I want it back.
170	00:11:13	00:11:15	This was not meant for public transit.
171	00:11:15	00:11:20	And your relationship with Michael Tinsley is?
172	00:11:20	00:11:22	Why is that any of your business?
173	00:11:23	00:11:25	I'm his girlfriend, okay?
174	00:11:25	00:11:27	How does his wife feel about that?
175	00:11:27	00:11:29	Not my problem.
176	00:11:29	00:11:31	They're separated, getting divorced.
177	00:11:31	00:11:32	Michael lives with me.
178	00:11:32	00:11:35	I want to talk to Michael now.
179	00:11:35	00:11:38	Were you at Lori Tinsley's house last night?
180	00:11:38	00:11:42	No. I've never been inside that psuedo Cape Cod dump.
181	00:11:42	00:11:46	If you've never been there, then how do you know it's a pseudo Cape Cod dump?
182	00:11:46	00:11:48	I know her taste.
183	00:11:48	00:11:51	Well, your fingerprints were at the scene.
184	00:11:51	00:11:54	In fact, you helped yourself to the record collection.
185	00:11:54	00:11:56	That's why I'm here?
186	00:11:56	00:11:58	Because you think I stole some albums?
187	00:11:58	00:12:00	What did Michael tell you?
188	00:12:00	00:12:01	Not much.
189	00:12:01	00:12:05	Look, he said Lori was planning on selling his vinyls.
190	00:12:05	00:12:13	So, last week, when she was out and he was at work, he gave me the keys, the alarm code and a list of albums he couldn't live without.
191	00:12:26	00:12:28	Michael's owned those records since high school.
192	00:12:28	00:12:31	He has the White Album, autographed by Paul McCartney.
193	00:12:31	00:12:34	And he didn't break into the house himself because...
194	00:12:34	00:12:36	Because he needed an alibi in case Lori pressed charges.
195	00:12:36	00:12:42	Look, I am trying to be helpful here, but I'm not saying another word until you let me talk to Michael.
196	00:12:42	00:12:48	You have the right to remain silent, but Michael Tinsley and Lori Tinsley are dead.
197	00:13:39	00:13:41	Oh, nice look.
198	00:13:41	00:13:43	That'll guarantee you the chicks.
199	00:13:43	00:13:48	Silvery material on your vic's face was Graftobian theatrical makeup.
200	00:13:48	00:13:50	Moonlight Silver is the color.
201	00:13:51	00:13:54	Okay, look, I can't stand the smell of hot dogs.
202	00:13:54	00:13:56	They make me sick.
203	00:13:56	00:13:59	So, all this stuff was in the vic's stomach?
204	00:13:59	00:14:01	Among other things.
205	00:14:01	00:14:02	You know what the worst kind of burp is?
206	00:14:03	00:14:04	Hot dog burp.
207	00:14:04	00:14:08	You know, like your dad's just letting them loose, or maybe the ex-girlfriend.
208	00:14:11	00:14:17	Well, as you can see, he wasn't much of a chewer, which was very lucky for us.
209	00:14:17	00:14:19	Made it easier to identify the food.
210	00:14:19	00:14:24	Cake, mac and cheese, pretzels, pasta, beef, shrimp, fish and, of course, hot dogs.
211	00:14:26	00:14:30	Food normally takes two to four hours to digest, which means he ate all of this...
212	00:14:30	00:14:34	In two to four hours before he died.
213	00:14:34	00:14:36	How many hot dogs did he eat?
214	00:14:36	00:14:38	Approximately 20.
215	00:14:38	00:14:40	God, ugh.
216	00:14:40	00:14:46	Do you think we might be able to ID the makers of the hot dogs from the ingredients? No.
217	00:14:46	00:14:49	Believe it or not, most hot dog companies are very proprietary over their recipes.
218	00:14:49	00:14:52	Well, how about through the griddle marks?
219	00:14:52	00:14:56	Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just run it through the Hot Dog Appliance database.
220	00:15:00	00:15:04	When was the last time you saw a branded logo on a hot dog?
221	00:15:04	00:15:06	Looks like those novelty chatter teeth.
222	00:15:07	00:15:07	Weird.
223	00:15:08	00:15:09	You think that's weird?
224	00:15:10	00:15:11	Check this out.
225	00:15:13	00:15:15	Go ahead. Dig in.
226	00:15:25	00:15:27	Circus Town Buffet.
227	00:15:27	00:15:30	All-U-Can-Eat.
228	00:15:42	00:15:44	I know exactly who that is.
229	00:15:44	00:15:46	How could I forget him?
230	00:16:00	00:16:02	Hi, we've got a problem.
231	00:16:02	00:16:05	Hurry up before the food's gone.
232	00:16:05	00:16:06	I called Security to kick him out.
233	00:16:06	00:16:08	When they arrived, he was gone.
234	00:16:08	00:16:09	Kick him out?
235	00:16:09	00:16:11	Sign outside says, All-U-Can-Eat.
236	00:16:11	00:16:14	Look, he was taking it a little too far.
237	00:16:14	00:16:16	Well, he paid, didn't he?
238	00:16:16	00:16:17	Yeah, cash.
239	00:16:17	00:16:19	So he still had his wallet.
240	00:16:19	00:16:21	Do you have any surveillance on your register?
241	00:16:21	00:16:23	For the $1.99 buffet?
242	00:16:23	00:16:24	That would be a no.
243	00:16:24	00:16:30	And are those the only hot dogs that you serve?
244	00:16:30	00:16:32	Yeah, we're famous for our cocktail wieners.
245	00:16:32	00:16:33	You should try one.
246	00:16:33	00:16:36	I think we need a couple of cocktails first.
247	00:16:36	00:16:39	DNA confirmed all the blood at the crime scene is Lora Tinsley's.
248	00:16:39	00:16:41	Sofia talked to their divorce lawyers.
249	00:16:41	00:16:45	Michael and Lori were fighting over everything-- the house, the cars, her jewelry.
250	00:16:45	00:16:48	When she found out that he was stealing his stuff back, she had the locks and the alarm codes changed.
251	00:16:48	00:16:55	Well, Michael did send his girlfriend Missy over to retrieve his vinyl, but last night he broke in himself, not to mention she was home.
252	00:16:55	00:16:57	That's kind of asking for trouble, isn't it?
253	00:16:57	00:16:59	Yeah, divorce is war, huh?
254	00:16:59	00:17:00	Sure glad I don't have that problem.
255	00:17:00	00:17:02	Yeah, me either. Hodges.
256	00:17:02	00:17:04	I'm not done with your samples, okay?
257	00:17:04	00:17:06	And I just received the fingernail scrapings.
258	00:17:06	00:17:08	Well, I sent the scrapings to DNA.
259	00:17:08	00:17:10	DNA kicked them over to me.
260	00:17:11	00:17:12	There were no biologicals in the sample.
261	00:17:12	00:17:14	Have you processed the hairs yet?
262	00:17:14	00:17:16	That, I have done.
263	00:17:16	00:17:20	All the hairs lifted off the victims' clothes were consistent with each other.
264	00:17:21	00:17:22	There's a sample under the scope.
265	00:17:24	00:17:30	Root is shaped like a spade which is indicative of canine, and the scale pattern is consistent with a golden retriever.
266	00:17:30	00:17:33	Oh, yeah, the victims have a golden retriever.
267	00:17:33	00:17:37	Well, if you'd cracked that mystery at the scene, you would've saved me a lot of time.
268	00:17:37	00:17:40	I've been working like a dog.
269	00:17:40	00:17:43	You know, studies have found that pet owners have lower stress levels.
270	00:17:43	00:17:44	You should check that out.
271	00:17:44	00:17:47	Well, I had hamsters growing up.
272	00:17:47	00:17:48	My mother hated them.
273	00:17:48	00:17:53	She said they stank up my room, but I just loved to watch them spinning on their little wheels.
274	00:17:53	00:17:57	One day I came home and they were gone.
275	00:17:57	00:18:00	Somehow they'd gotten out of their cage.
276	00:18:00	00:18:02	How much did your mother hate them?
277	00:18:02	00:18:04	They ran away.
278	00:19:29	00:19:31	Michael Tinsley was shot?
279	00:19:31	00:19:35	Yeah, the bullet penetrated the base of the brain and lodged in the occipital lobe.
280	00:19:35	00:19:37	The hemorrhage was intracranial.
281	00:19:37	00:19:39	Looks like a .22 caliber.
282	00:19:39	00:19:42	Yeah, the scalp abrasion was probably incidental.
283	00:19:42	00:19:46	We did not check the house for GSR; we didn't know he was shot.
284	00:19:46	00:19:50	That's understandable-- the entry wound wasn't visible-- but check this out.
285	00:19:54	00:19:57	Some people will put anything up their nose.
286	00:19:58	00:20:05	So, Michael Tinsley breaks into his own house, the alarm goes off, all hell breaks loose.
287	00:20:05	00:20:09	She shoots him, the bullet goes up his nose, and then what?
288	00:20:09	00:20:12	Kahlua freaks and rips out the wife's throat?
289	00:20:12	00:20:16	It's possible, which is another reason I prefer cats.
290	00:20:16	00:20:19	The Tinsleys died at home... alone.
291	00:20:19	00:20:22	So, where's the gun?
292	00:20:30	00:20:32	I went shopping.
293	00:20:32	00:20:35	Bought every brand of hot dog for sale in Las Vegas.
294	00:20:35	00:20:36	Who's paying for it?
295	00:20:36	00:20:38	You mean the lab's not going to reimburse me?
296	00:20:39	00:20:40	No.
297	00:20:40	00:20:48	Well, I couldn't identify the chatter teeth logo, so I figured I could physically match one of these to the one found in the victim's stomach, you know?
298	00:20:48	00:20:51	Maybe comparing that twisty thing at the end.
299	00:20:51	00:20:53	Sounds like a good idea, Greg.
300	00:20:53	00:20:55	I'm still not paying for it.
301	00:20:55	00:20:58	Fine-- guess I'll just eat hot dogs for the rest of the year.
302	00:20:58	00:21:02	A hot dog at the ballpark tastes better than a steak at the Ritz.
303	00:21:02	00:21:05	Well, I can tell when you're quoting something.
304	00:21:05	00:21:06	Who said it?
305	00:21:06	00:21:07	Humphrey Bogart.
306	00:21:07	00:21:08	Mm.
307	00:21:08	00:21:11	Did you know that the term hot dog was actually coined at a baseball game?
308	00:21:11	00:21:16	New York Polo Grounds, somewhere around 1867.
309	00:21:16	00:21:20	A German butcher was selling what he called dachshund sausages out of his pie wagon.
310	00:21:20	00:21:23	He put them on a roll, so that his customers wouldn't burn their fingers.
311	00:21:24	00:21:28	He'd yell out Get your dachshund sausages, they're red hot!
312	00:21:28	00:21:31	Soon, all the vendors at the Polo Grounds were selling them, too.
313	00:21:31	00:21:34	But they were too lazy to say dachshund sausages, so they just called them hot dogs.
314	00:21:34	00:21:38	Now there's over 50 major brands.
315	00:21:38	00:21:40	Good luck. I'm rooting for you.
316	00:21:40	00:21:43	Well, hopefully I find a wiener.
317	00:22:25	00:22:26	Gut check, one, two!
318	00:22:26	00:22:28	Gut check!
319	00:22:28	00:22:30	Ladies and gentlemen!
320	00:22:30	00:22:32	Time for the bib sheets.
321	00:22:33	00:22:36	Today's match will include some of the most famous gurgitators in the sport.
322	00:22:39	00:22:43	The godfather of the sport has a mouth so big he speaks in Surround Sound, ladies and gentlemen.
323	00:22:43	00:22:49	Three-time lasagna-eating champion Antonio Colletti.
324	00:22:49	00:22:53	Patty Cake, Patty Cake, baker's man, she can eat a cake faster than anyone can.
325	00:22:53	00:22:59	Current cupcake champion and the most elegant eater in the sport, Patty Cake Newton.
326	00:22:59	00:23:01	Our most vocal gurgitator...
327	00:23:01	00:23:04	There's the chatter teeth logo.
328	00:23:04	00:23:06	E.X.E.F.
329	00:23:06	00:23:10	Wasn't that the name on the business card you found in the vic's wallet?
330	00:23:10	00:23:13	I think we just found our Digger James.
331	00:23:13	00:23:15	...he's said to have two stomachs!
332	00:23:15	00:23:21	Undisputed popcorn shrimp champion, James Spare Tank Patterson.
333	00:23:23	00:23:37	And finally, known for his jaw strength, trains with his pit bulls, three-time rib champion-- today he will be wearing the E.X.E.F. hot dog camera-- Marty Mayron, The Meat Machine!
334	00:23:40	00:23:47	All right, gurgitators, you have 12 minutes to eat your way into history.
335	00:23:47	00:23:49	They're diving straight in there.
336	00:23:49	00:23:58	Marty Mayron going with the Japanese, dipping his bun in lemonade to make it go down easier and then biting that hot dog into little pieces.
337	00:23:58	00:24:02	Not to be outdone, Miomoto going for the double Japanese.
338	00:24:02	00:24:06	Colletti, the old pro, double fisting it, double dunking it.
339	00:24:06	00:24:08	That is a Heimlich waiting to happen.
340	00:24:10	00:24:12	Bun first, hot dog afterwards.
341	00:24:12	00:24:15	Sort of a dachshund chaser.
342	00:24:15	00:24:21	Still pushing it, going old school, like a little kid trying to impress his grandmother at Thanksgiving dinner.
343	00:24:21	00:24:25	Patty Cake going mostly cakey on that one.
344	00:24:25	00:24:28	You can almost see the icing on that hot dog.
345	00:24:28	00:24:29	Colletti having a bit of a problem.
346	00:24:29	00:24:31	Something's slowing him down.
347	00:24:31	00:24:32	Whoa!
348	00:24:32	00:24:36	Antonio Colletti, a reversal of fortune.
349	00:24:36	00:24:41	That's an immediate disqualification, and, of course, disgusting for all of us to watch.
350	00:24:42	00:24:44	Wow.
351	00:24:44	00:24:45	Well, which one do you want?
352	00:24:45	00:24:49	The guy in the silver face paint or Digger James?
353	00:24:49	00:24:51	I don't know-- slimy stuff is your thing.
354	00:24:51	00:24:52	I don't want to get mustard on my suit.
355	00:24:53	00:24:53	I'll take Digger.
356	00:24:54	00:24:56	Do I have a choice?
357	00:24:59	00:25:01	Hey, you recognize this guy?
358	00:25:01	00:25:02	That's Jerry.
359	00:25:02	00:25:05	By far, one of the best walk-on gurgitators I've ever seen.
360	00:25:05	00:25:08	So you gave him your business card, right?
361	00:25:08	00:25:10	I'm the U.S. rep for the E.X.E.F.
362	00:25:10	00:25:14	All right, E.X.E.F.-- what exactly does that stand for?
363	00:25:14	00:25:16	It's the Extreme Eating Federation.
364	00:25:16	00:25:18	We're one of the most popular leagues in the sport.
365	00:25:18	00:25:20	Pounding down hot dogs, that's a sport?
366	00:25:20	00:25:22	Since the early days of man.
367	00:25:22	00:25:27	You got 30 Neanderthals in a cave and a rabbit walks in, you have a competitive eating situation, my friend.
368	00:25:27	00:25:29	We have rules, records, prize money.
369	00:25:29	00:25:32	Some of our top competitors earn up to a half a million dollars a year.
370	00:25:33	00:25:33	We're on cable.
371	00:25:34	00:25:35	No kidding.
372	00:25:35	00:25:37	Well, what does all this have to do with Jerry?
373	00:25:37	00:25:39	Everything.
374	00:25:39	00:25:41	Jerry had undeniable gastro-intestinal fortitude.
375	00:25:41	00:25:44	He took third in yesterday's competition.
376	00:25:44	00:25:46	That qualifies him for the finals in Atlantic City.
377	00:25:46	00:25:48	It made the Las Vegas Post. Hm.
378	00:25:48	00:25:50	Sports section.
379	00:26:12	00:26:14	Can I keep this?
380	00:26:14	00:26:15	Sure. Thanks.
381	00:26:16	00:26:19	I'm telling you, with proper training, Jerry could've proudly represented the U.S.
382	00:26:19	00:26:22	and taken back the Golden Weenie from the Japanese Champion.
383	00:26:22	00:26:24	Yeah, got to get that Golden Weenie back.
384	00:26:24	00:26:27	Uh, so after the tournament, did you see Jerry?
385	00:26:27	00:26:30	Paid him, gave him my card, left him to celebrate.
386	00:26:31	00:26:33	Any idea who he was celebrating with?
387	00:26:34	00:26:35	You want a sample of my face paint?
388	00:26:35	00:26:38	Yeah, it's part of my investigation.
389	00:26:39	00:26:41	Oh, it's still moist.
390	00:26:41	00:26:42	That's good for me.
391	00:26:42	00:26:45	I didn't do anything to Jerry Gable.
392	00:26:45	00:26:51	Okay, in the beginning, I admit I was a little pee'd off that I lost to the guy.
393	00:26:51	00:26:55	But then I learned what a disturbed individual he was.
394	00:26:55	00:26:56	Couple more!
395	00:26:56	00:26:59	Just, just, just, just, a couple... couple more!
396	00:26:59	00:27:02	Has anybody got more hot dogs?
397	00:27:02	00:27:03	( shrieks ) Please!
398	00:27:03	00:27:05	What are you trying to prove, huh?
399	00:27:05	00:27:06	Just give me more!
400	00:27:06	00:27:08	Trying to be a big guy, tough guy, huh?
401	00:27:08	00:27:11	Please, please! ( whimpering, crying )
402	00:27:13	00:27:16	And what happened after the friendly hug?
403	00:27:17	00:27:19	Some guy in a hat came by, took him out of here.
404	00:27:21	00:27:23	Is that the guy in the hat?
405	00:27:24	00:27:26	Sure is.
406	00:28:51	00:28:53	So I found the murder weapon.
407	00:28:54	00:28:58	It slipped under the living room couch-- presumably when Kahlua attacked Lori.
408	00:28:58	00:29:01	Well, a dog did attack Lori, but it wasn't Kahlua.
409	00:29:01	00:29:05	The bite marks on Lori's neck are inconsistent with Kahlua's teeth.
410	00:29:05	00:29:07	Oh, which means Kahlua gets to walk.
411	00:29:07	00:29:11	Check out this left canine.
412	00:29:13	00:29:15	The tooth is chipped.
413	00:29:15	00:29:22	All the dog hair we found at the crime scene was consistent with a golden retriever, which suggests there was another golden retriever in the house.
414	00:29:22	00:29:25	It could've attacked Lori, fled out the kitchen door.
415	00:29:25	00:29:31	That is like saying there's a second shooter on the grassy knoll-- they only had one dog, Nick.
416	00:29:31	00:29:32	I'm calling Animal Control.
417	00:29:32	00:29:37	We're looking for another golden retriever, one with a bad tooth and rotten disposition.
418	00:29:48	00:29:50	Little late to be going to court.
419	00:29:50	00:29:52	No, I'm not going to court.
420	00:29:52	00:29:57	I'm taking my lady Tina to that new Cirque show at the Wynn and I forgot my tickets in my locker.
421	00:29:57	00:30:01	That's nice, but if you're looking for something to tide you over, look no further.
422	00:30:05	00:30:07	Busy night.
423	00:30:07	00:30:10	Figured the lab could use a little lovin' from the oven.
424	00:30:10	00:30:12	Oh, your wife made a pie.
425	00:30:12	00:30:14	I made the pie.
426	00:30:14	00:30:17	Strawberry rhubarb.
427	00:30:17	00:30:19	I'm impressed.
428	00:30:21	00:30:26	Let's take it easy with the cutting there, Doc, it's starting to look like the hit-and-run on your table last week.
429	00:30:26	00:30:27	Just try it.
430	00:30:27	00:30:28	Thanks.
431	00:30:28	00:30:29	You know, it's vegan.
432	00:30:29	00:30:32	Low fat, low sugar, low carb.
433	00:30:32	00:30:34	Low taste.
434	00:30:35	00:30:36	Catherine, Catherine, come here.
435	00:30:36	00:30:38	I need your opinion on this.
436	00:30:42	00:30:44	Try this.
437	00:30:44	00:30:47	No, thank you, I just came from Nel's Hot Dog Eating Tournament.
438	00:30:47	00:30:50	I'm really done with food. It's good.
439	00:30:50	00:30:51	I was watching that on cable.
440	00:30:51	00:30:56	Some Japanese guy ate, like, 64 hot dogs in 12 minutes. Yeah.
441	00:30:56	00:30:58	He's was the most famous guy in Japan behind Yao Ming.
442	00:30:58	00:31:00	Yao Ming is Chinese. Try it.
443	00:31:00	00:31:02	They ought to make it an Olympic sport or something.
444	00:31:02	00:31:04	Please?
445	00:31:04	00:31:05	No, I can't go there. I can't.
446	00:31:05	00:31:10	You know, if you want to cleanse your taste buds, I suggest you try Doc Robbins' pie.
447	00:31:10	00:31:11	Really.
448	00:31:11	00:31:13	Yeah, that's why you're leaving it behind.
449	00:31:18	00:31:21	I got an ID on Dumpster guy.
450	00:31:21	00:31:23	Brass is tracking down a current address.
451	00:31:23	00:31:25	Prader-Willi.
452	00:31:25	00:31:27	No, his name was Jerry Gable.
453	00:31:27	00:31:30	No, Prader-Willi Syndrome.
454	00:31:30	00:31:35	A rare gentic disorder that causes ceaseless, uncontrollable excruciating hunger.
455	00:31:35	00:31:38	It's as if your stomach was truly a bottomless pit.
456	00:31:38	00:31:44	That could explain why after consuming 22 dogs, he wanted more.
457	00:31:44	00:31:46	Could also explain why he was found in the Dumpster.
458	00:31:46	00:31:48	He followed the food.
459	00:31:48	00:31:55	Prader-Willi Syndrome is characterized by short stature, hypotonia, almond-shaped eyes, and obsessive fingernail biting.
460	00:31:55	00:31:57	That kind of fits the victim's description.
461	00:31:57	00:32:00	Sufferers are born with a flawed hypothalamus.
462	00:32:00	00:32:04	Normal hypothalamus receives a signal from the stomach-- I'm full, stop eating.
463	00:32:11	00:32:16	But with Prader-Willi Syndrome, the signal never reaches the brain.
464	00:32:28	00:32:30	They're always hungry.
465	00:32:30	00:32:33	Like having a full tank of gas, and gauge is stuck on empty.
466	00:32:33	00:32:36	Guy's like Jerry are monitored their whole lives.
467	00:32:36	00:32:39	Constant supervision 24 hours a day.
468	00:32:39	00:32:42	You remember the scar tissue we found on his wrist?
469	00:32:49	00:32:53	I think it's possible that our vic spent most of his life in restraints.
470	00:32:53	00:32:55	So either he escaped or...
471	00:32:56	00:32:58	someone set him free.
472	00:32:58	00:33:01	In which case, they'd be responsible for his death.
473	00:33:01	00:33:03	I heard your case has gone to the dogs.
474	00:33:03	00:33:05	Oh, Hodges, heel.
475	00:33:05	00:33:07	No, better yet, play dead, man.
476	00:33:07	00:33:09	Play nice, I'm throwing you a bone.
477	00:33:09	00:33:13	The fingernail scrapings from your female vic was baking grease.
478	00:33:13	00:33:15	How does that fit in the puzzle?
479	00:33:20	00:33:22	Hey.
480	00:33:22	00:33:28	According to the court records, the Tinsleys weren't just fighting over property, they were also engaged in an expensive custody battle.
481	00:33:28	00:33:29	Custody over what?
482	00:33:29	00:33:31	They didn't have any kids.
483	00:33:31	00:33:32	They had Kahlua.
484	00:33:34	00:33:40	And evidentally, yesterday both parties agreed to let the dog decide for herself.
485	00:33:40	00:33:44	According to Michael's girlfriend, the dog was his, but Kahlua chose Lori.
486	00:33:44	00:33:46	Kahlua, come.
487	00:33:46	00:33:47	Kahlua, come. Come here.
488	00:33:47	00:33:49	Come. Come here.
489	00:33:49	00:33:50	Kahlua, come. Come.
490	00:33:50	00:33:51	Come. Kahlua.
491	00:33:55	00:33:57	I think I know why.
492	00:33:58	00:34:01	Lori greased up before the big face-off.
493	00:34:03	00:34:04	Kahlua, come.
494	00:34:04	00:34:06	Come, Kahlua.
495	00:34:06	00:34:07	Kahlua, Kahlua, come.
496	00:34:07	00:34:08	Come, come here.
497	00:34:08	00:34:10	Kahlua, come here.
498	00:34:10	00:34:11	Come.
499	00:34:14	00:34:18	A dog's sense of smell is 25 times more sensitive than humans.
500	00:34:18	00:34:21	Bacon grease would've been pretty irresistible.
501	00:34:21	00:34:22	Question is...
502	00:34:23	00:34:25	Did Michael know that Lori was playing dirty?
503	00:34:27	00:34:29	Stokes.
504	00:34:30	00:34:31	Yeah, all right, cool.
505	00:34:33	00:34:36	Our suspect is in custody.
506	00:34:38	00:34:43	Animal control picked her up near Centennial Park, called the number on the tag, left a voice mail.
507	00:34:43	00:34:45	Dead people don't return calls.
508	00:34:45	00:34:48	New collar, new tags.
509	00:34:48	00:34:49	Kahlua. Same name.
510	00:34:49	00:34:51	Spoke to Animal Control.
511	00:34:51	00:34:54	Kahlua number two was adopted the same day as the murder.
512	00:34:54	00:34:55	You want to guess the adopter's name?
513	00:34:55	00:34:57	Michael Tinsley.
514	00:34:57	00:34:59	You bet.
515	00:34:59	00:35:00	He adopted Kahlua's doppelganger.
516	00:35:01	00:35:04	Left tooth is chipped. Confirm's ID.
517	00:35:04	00:35:06	She doesn't seem very ferocious.
518	00:35:06	00:35:07	You want to see ferocious?
519	00:35:07	00:35:09	Yeah.
520	00:35:24	00:35:26	How did you know?
521	00:35:26	00:35:30	When the guys loaded her up into the Animal Control van, they slammed the door and she went off.
522	00:35:30	00:35:31	So the gun acted as a trigger.
523	00:35:31	00:35:33	She heard it and attacked Lori.
524	00:35:33	00:35:35	Probably abused in the past.
525	00:35:35	00:35:38	If they'd known, they never would've put her up for adoption.
526	00:35:38	00:35:43	Michael broke into the house intending to swap dogs, hoping that Lori wouldn't even notice the difference.
527	00:35:55	00:35:56	You don't give a damn about Kahlua!
528	00:35:57	00:35:58	You just don't want me to have her!
529	00:35:58	00:36:00	You care more about that stupid dog than you did me!
530	00:36:00	00:36:01	For once you got it right!
531	00:36:16	00:36:21	When Kahlua number two took off, Kahlua number one came out of hiding.
532	00:36:33	00:36:36	The police showed up, she got scared , went back to her closet.
533	00:36:36	00:36:40	Their marriage ended in a dog fight, and only the dog survived.
534	00:36:40	00:36:43	So I called about a dozen Jerry Gables.
535	00:36:43	00:36:47	One had an answering machine for Jerry and Suzie Gable.
536	00:36:47	00:36:50	This apartment is listed to Jerry and Suzie Gable.
537	00:36:50	00:36:52	Here's Suzie.
538	00:36:52	00:36:54	( knocking ) Las Vegas Police.
539	00:36:58	00:37:00	Please tell me you found Jerry.
540	00:37:15	00:37:18	Okay, so who are you?
541	00:37:18	00:37:20	I'm Susie's boyfriend.
542	00:37:20	00:37:23	All right, Susie's boyfriend, what's your name?
543	00:37:23	00:37:25	Look, I don't have anything else to say.
544	00:37:25	00:37:27	Hey, that's my easiest question.
545	00:37:27	00:37:33	Hey, you don't want to give us your name, fine, but you better explain why Jerry's not in this chair.
546	00:37:35	00:37:39	All right, look, I'm going to print this restraint.
547	00:37:39	00:37:44	And when I find your fingerprints all over it, I won't need to ask you again.
548	00:37:44	00:37:46	Okay, okay, all right.
549	00:37:47	00:37:49	He escaped.
550	00:37:49	00:37:55	All right? I was supposed to be watching him, and I conked out for a second, and by the time I got up, he was gone from his chair.
551	00:37:55	00:37:56	He escaped?
552	00:37:56	00:37:58	So, what, the guy's Houdini?
553	00:37:58	00:38:00	Trust me.
554	00:38:00	00:38:02	He may have been slow, but he was manipulative.
555	00:38:02	00:38:03	Yeah.
556	00:38:03	00:38:09	Look, how do you deny a 30-year-old man food?
557	00:38:10	00:38:13	I mean, I felt like I was torturing the poor guy.
558	00:38:13	00:38:16	Yeah, I told you them Vikings suck.
559	00:38:16	00:38:20	All right, I'll meet you at the Circus Town book.
560	00:38:20	00:38:24	Can I go to Circus Town with you?
561	00:38:24	00:38:26	I heard the buffet there is yummy.
562	00:38:26	00:38:28	No.
563	00:38:37	00:38:41	My plan was just to drop him off at the buffet while I went back to the sports book.
564	00:38:41	00:38:47	By the time I got back... oh, man...
565	00:38:47	00:38:49	Hey! ( glass clinking )
566	00:39:04	00:39:06	I couldn't help myself.
567	00:39:06	00:39:08	I had to sign him up.
568	00:39:09	00:39:12	So let me guess-- you blew his winnings at the sports book?
569	00:39:12	00:39:14	Well, what was he gonna do with them?
570	00:39:14	00:39:17	He's been strapped to a damn chair his whole life.
571	00:39:17	00:39:21	You know, you managed to supersize a combo of two deadly sins-- greed and gluttony.
572	00:39:21	00:39:24	Shame on you.
573	00:39:24	00:39:26	So what's he doing in a dumpster?
574	00:39:26	00:39:29	I don't know, was there food in the dumpster?
575	00:39:29	00:39:32	'Cause when we were on our way home, Jerry was still hungry.
576	00:39:32	00:39:34	Wanted to hit up Krispy Kreme.
577	00:39:34	00:39:39	And by the time I could tell him no, he was running off down the street.
578	00:39:39	00:39:41	I looked for him all night.
579	00:39:41	00:39:44	Yeah? Where's Susie?
580	00:39:48	00:39:51	I knew I shouldn't have left Jerry with my boyfriend.
581	00:39:51	00:39:53	I'd been calling to check in.
582	00:39:53	00:39:54	He wasn't answering.
583	00:39:54	00:39:56	I could tell something was up.
584	00:39:56	00:40:00	Why did you leave your brother with somebody you didn't trust?
585	00:40:00	00:40:02	There was no one else.
586	00:40:02	00:40:07	I had to get this surgery today or my insurance wasn't going to cover it.
587	00:40:07	00:40:10	Couldn't you have left him with a family member?
588	00:40:10	00:40:12	We have no family.
589	00:40:12	00:40:17	Our parents died in a car crash years ago.
590	00:40:17	00:40:21	What about some kind of professional help?
591	00:40:21	00:40:23	I'm a waitress, Miss.
592	00:40:23	00:40:27	I... I don't make much.
593	00:40:27	00:40:33	There's a really nice institution in Summerlin, but it costs a $100,000 a year.
594	00:40:34	00:40:41	And the last babysitter I hired, Jerry beat up trying to get to the fridge.
595	00:40:43	00:40:46	I swear to you, I really tried to take care of my brother.
596	00:40:46	00:40:50	I really... did the best I could.
597	00:41:21	00:41:23	Jerry took third place?
598	00:41:23	00:41:25	Yeah.
599	00:41:27	00:41:29	I bet he had the time of his life.
