2,00:01:19,00:01:21,(sniffing)
3,00:01:32,00:01:33,(man screams)
4,00:01:43,00:01:46,(man screaming)
5,00:01:48,00:01:50,MAN: Local homeowner called it in early.
6,00:01:51,00:01:53,We got it contained pretty quick.
7,00:01:53,00:01:55,We were lucky. (camera clicks)
8,00:01:55,00:01:57,Luckier than he was.
9,00:01:59,00:02:01,"Low humidity, dry brush."
10,00:02:01,00:02:03,Perfect conditions for maximum damage.
11,00:02:03,00:02:06,Firebugs listen to the weather reports just like we do.
12,00:02:06,00:02:08,Only for different reasons.
13,00:02:08,00:02:11,Maybe some moron just threw a cigarette out the car window.
14,00:02:11,00:02:12,You're an optimist.
15,00:02:14,00:02:15,Do you have a point of origin?
16,00:02:15,00:02:16,Not yet...
17,00:02:16,00:02:18,Fire spread down the slope.
18,00:02:18,00:02:21,Probably started along top of the ridge.
19,00:02:21,00:02:23,I'll give you a shout when it's safe to come up.
20,00:02:23,00:02:24,"Okay, Mom."
21,00:02:26,00:02:31,This area was always a good place for stargazing.
22,00:02:31,00:02:34,"It's a good make-out spot, too. So I've heard."
23,00:02:34,00:02:36,(camera clicking)
24,00:03:07,00:03:09,Sara!
25,00:03:09,00:03:13,We've got another body down here.
26,00:03:13,00:03:16,Get the paramedics!
27,00:03:48,00:03:52,"WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Forrest, dial 102, please. Dr. Forrest..."
28,00:03:57,00:03:59,I'm Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab.
29,00:03:59,00:04:01,I'm here to collect trace from the arson victim.
30,00:04:01,00:04:02,She was in the burn unit.
31,00:04:02,00:04:03,Bay number three.
32,00:04:04,00:04:05,Thanks.
33,00:04:37,00:04:38,I thought...
34,00:04:38,00:04:42,I just assumed she was dead.
35,00:04:42,00:04:44,It's a miracle she's not.
36,00:04:44,00:04:46,This is as bad as it gets.
37,00:04:46,00:04:49,SANDERS: How extensive are the burns?
38,00:04:49,00:04:51,DOCTOR: 80 percent.
39,00:04:51,00:04:54,Mostly third degree.
40,00:04:54,00:04:57,I hope the morphine's working.
41,00:04:57,00:04:59,Third degree burns are painless.
42,00:04:59,00:05:00,The nerves are burned away.
43,00:05:00,00:05:04,She's not conscious of what's happening to her.
44,00:05:04,00:05:06,Not now.
45,00:05:06,00:05:08,SANDERS: She's still a Jane Doe.
46,00:05:08,00:05:14,"I'm going to need all of her clothes, as well as any trace off her body."
47,00:05:14,00:05:16,We'll save whatever we find during debridement.
48,00:05:16,00:05:18,Debridement?
49,00:05:18,00:05:22,"We scrape off the dead flesh, then cover it with cadaver skin."
50,00:05:22,00:05:23,We then wrap it with gauze.
51,00:05:23,00:05:26,It prevents infection and allows the remaining tissue to heal.
52,00:05:26,00:05:29,(metal snaps)
53,00:05:34,00:05:36,(ring clanks)
54,00:05:38,00:05:41,DOCTOR: She's gonna lose those fingers.
55,00:05:47,00:05:49,EMT: Continue chest compressions and manual oxygen.
56,00:05:49,00:05:52,EMT 2: Giving her Atropine and epi via I.V.
57,00:05:52,00:05:54,ETA to Palm Desert-- eight minutes.
58,00:05:54,00:05:55,Just going through the motions.
59,00:05:55,00:05:58,Kid's name is Dani Stewart; she's five.
60,00:05:58,00:06:03,"Neighbors saw her floating facedown in the pool from their second-story balcony, called 911."
61,00:06:03,00:06:04,Why didn't they pull her out?
62,00:06:04,00:06:05,They couldn't get in the backyard gate.
63,00:06:05,00:06:07,Childproof lock.
64,00:06:07,00:06:08,"No key, no access."
65,00:06:09,00:06:10,Parents protected that kid to death.
66,00:06:10,00:06:11,Where the hell were they?
67,00:06:13,00:06:14,Home.
68,00:06:20,00:06:22,"We'll call you, Dave, when we clear a path."
69,00:06:22,00:06:25,Okay.
70,00:06:25,00:06:30,(goofy squawking over TV)
71,00:06:33,00:06:37,"(boinging, silly cackling over TV)"
72,00:07:07,00:07:09,"Oh, man."
73,00:07:23,00:07:26,Whew.
74,00:07:26,00:07:28,Well...
75,00:07:29,00:07:31,She obviously fell forward...
76,00:07:31,00:07:33,As she ran down the stairs.
77,00:07:39,00:07:41,Lots of pictures of the kid.
78,00:07:41,00:07:44,"Family revolved around the child, huh?"
79,00:07:44,00:07:46,"Yeah, way it should be."
80,00:07:51,00:07:53,WILLOWS: Struggle?
81,00:07:57,00:07:59,She might have put her hand out to break her fall.
82,00:08:16,00:08:19,Man.
83,00:08:19,00:08:21,What a scene.
84,00:08:38,00:08:39,BROWN: What are you thinking?
85,00:08:39,00:08:43,Maybe murder-suicide.
86,00:08:51,00:08:53,I don't know.
87,00:08:53,00:08:56,This gun looks like it might've been wiped clean.
88,00:08:56,00:08:58,WILLOWS: You thinking professional hit?
89,00:08:58,00:08:59,(gunshot)
90,00:09:08,00:09:11,What about the little girl?
91,00:09:11,00:09:13,Loose end.
92,00:09:15,00:09:17,"Mommy, why is everybody screaming?"
93,00:09:17,00:09:21,There are three bodies in three locations.
94,00:09:21,00:09:22,A lot of variables.
95,00:09:23,00:09:25,Where do you want to start?
96,00:09:43,00:09:46,"(Sidle, Grissom panting)"
97,00:10:06,00:10:09,I've got...
98,00:10:09,00:10:12,the business end of a disposable lighter.
99,00:10:12,00:10:14,Could be an ignition source.
100,00:10:17,00:10:18,(camera clicking)
101,00:10:18,00:10:19,(unzips backpack)
102,00:10:23,00:10:25,Hey.
103,00:10:25,00:10:27,What's that?
104,00:10:27,00:10:30,(indistinct background radio communication)
105,00:10:36,00:10:38,(camera clicking)
106,00:10:38,00:10:40,Possible accelerant.
107,00:10:40,00:10:42,Or possible martini.
108,00:10:42,00:10:45,(camera clicks)
109,00:10:48,00:10:50,I didn't think you could smell vodka.
110,00:10:51,00:10:54,"Well, that depends on how long it was distilled."
111,00:10:54,00:10:55,Cheap stuff.
112,00:10:55,00:11:01,"Ironically, the word for vodka comes from the Russian phrase zhizennia voda."
113,00:11:02,00:11:20,"""Water of life."" Hey."
114,00:11:20,00:11:22,"Hey, Super Dave."
115,00:11:22,00:11:25,You have any idea when I might be able to process the bodies?
116,00:11:25,00:11:26,Uh...
117,00:11:26,00:11:28,That'd be a question for the boss lady.
118,00:11:28,00:11:30,She's upstairs to the right.
119,00:11:30,00:11:31,Thanks.
120,00:11:43,00:11:45,WILLOWS: I've got some long hairs on the pillow-- brunette.
121,00:11:46,00:11:47,Wife was a blonde.
122,00:11:47,00:11:49,"So was the daughter, right? Yeah."
123,00:11:51,00:11:53,"Well, I'll collect the sheets as soon as I'm finished up here."
124,00:11:53,00:11:58,"PHILLIPS: Hey, Catherine, um, I was wondering if I... Oh, I'm sorry, David."
125,00:11:58,00:12:01,We're going need to keep the bodies in their original position for a while longer.
126,00:12:01,00:12:06,"STOKES: Crime scene this messy, gotta bust out the big guns, you know what I mean?"
127,00:12:09,00:12:14,"Hey, did you know that Ecklie volunteered the lab to evaluate this scanner for Third Tech?"
128,00:12:14,00:12:15,I'm sure he's hoping they'll give us one for free.
129,00:12:15,00:12:17,I wouldn't count on it.
130,00:12:17,00:12:21,But I am definitely going to enjoy using this while it's here.
131,00:12:21,00:12:22,Virtual crime scene sketch.
132,00:12:22,00:12:24,Sure beats doing it by hand.
133,00:12:39,00:12:43,The whole family...
134,00:12:43,00:12:45,dead?
135,00:12:45,00:12:49,"Dani, too?"
136,00:12:51,00:12:54,She just had her birthday.
137,00:12:54,00:12:58,How long have you been Morgan Stewart's assistant?
138,00:12:58,00:13:00,Uh...
139,00:13:00,00:13:03,about two years now.
140,00:13:03,00:13:05,Did you and Morgan ever see each other outside of work?
141,00:13:05,00:13:07,Well...
142,00:13:07,00:13:11,I baby-sat Dani sometimes for some extra cash.
143,00:13:11,00:13:12,I'm putting myself through school.
144,00:13:12,00:13:15,We found a brown hair in his bed.
145,00:13:15,00:13:17,Your color.
146,00:13:17,00:13:27,"I wasn't sleeping with Morgan, and if you knew him, you wouldn't bother implying it."
147,00:13:27,00:13:30,He was devoted to his wife.
148,00:13:31,00:13:33,He was a...
149,00:13:33,00:13:35,He was a wonderful father.
150,00:13:35,00:13:37,Hmm.
151,00:13:37,00:13:39,Were you ever in his bedroom?
152,00:13:39,00:13:41,(scoffs) No.
153,00:13:41,00:13:45,Then you wouldn't mind giving us a sample of your hair.
154,00:13:45,00:13:48,No. Be glad to...
155,00:13:48,00:13:50,as soon as you show me a court order.
156,00:13:50,00:13:51,You know how that makes you look?
157,00:13:51,00:13:53,Save it.
158,00:13:53,00:13:54,I'm pre-law.
159,00:13:58,00:14:01,(beeping at varying rates)
160,00:14:04,00:14:07,"(several long beeps, then beeping stops)"
161,00:14:18,00:14:20,I hear our victim is still alive.
162,00:14:20,00:14:22,I don't see why.
163,00:14:22,00:14:26,"Well, she's not ready to let go yet."
164,00:14:26,00:14:28,SANDERS: Some kind of melted card.
165,00:14:28,00:14:32,I found traces of alcohol all over her clothes.
166,00:14:32,00:14:34,She was doused in it.
167,00:14:34,00:14:38,The accelerant and the probable ignition source were found at the top of the hill.
168,00:14:39,00:14:40,That was the point of origin.
169,00:14:40,00:14:45,"But the victim was found, almost completely burned, at thebottomof the hill."
170,00:14:47,00:14:51,I don't think she was caught in the fire...
171,00:14:54,00:14:56,I think she started it.
172,00:15:17,00:15:20,"(camera shutter clicks, quiet beeping)"
173,00:15:23,00:15:25,(beeping)
174,00:15:25,00:15:29,SIDLE: I got a work card hit off the vodka bottle-- a Patrick Bromley.
175,00:15:29,00:15:30,He used to bus tables at the Palms.
176,00:15:30,00:15:33,"These days, he's driving a big rig."
177,00:15:33,00:15:34,He's a trucker.
178,00:15:34,00:15:35,Let me guess: he's on the road.
179,00:15:35,00:15:37,"According to his employer, yes."
180,00:15:37,00:15:40,Vartann is working at bringing him in.
181,00:15:40,00:15:51,"But, as it turns out, the company tracks its drivers via GPS, and they were kind enough-- under threat of subpoena-- to give me access to Mr. Bromley's route data for the last 24 hours."
182,00:15:54,00:15:55,And what do you know.
183,00:15:55,00:15:57,(beep)
184,00:15:57,00:15:59,He was in the area of the fire anhour before the alarm went out?
185,00:16:00,00:16:07,"Yes. And about a half hour before that, he made a stop at the local Gas 'N' Sip."
186,00:16:07,00:16:09,"Well, see if the store's got video surveillance."
187,00:16:09,00:16:12,Done. Footage is on its way in.
188,00:16:21,00:16:26,BROMLEY: You got my dispatcher crawling all over my ass for the past five hours.
189,00:16:26,00:16:28,"You know, you pull off a route, that costs me money."
190,00:16:28,00:16:30,Hey... shut up.
191,00:16:30,00:16:33,Why don't you tell us about your friend here.
192,00:16:35,00:16:37,BROMLEY: She's not my friend.
193,00:16:37,00:16:39,I picked her up hitching out on Sunset.
194,00:16:39,00:16:40,Did she tell you her name?
195,00:16:40,00:16:42,Never came up.
196,00:16:42,00:16:44,Where and when did you see her last?
197,00:16:44,00:16:46,Dropped her off on Blue Diamond Road.
198,00:16:47,00:16:49,"In the middle of nowhere, just like that?"
199,00:16:49,00:16:50,Yeah. She wanted out.
200,00:16:50,00:16:51,SIDLE: I bet she did.
201,00:16:52,00:16:55,"Where did you get the, uh, scratches on your neck?"
202,00:16:55,00:16:57,"A bar fight, couple of nights ago."
203,00:16:59,00:17:01,"Hey, do you mind if we look inside your truck?"
204,00:17:03,00:17:05,If that's what's gonna get me back on the road.
205,00:17:47,00:17:48,SIDLE: Mr. Bromley!
206,00:17:48,00:17:51,Pink is not your color.
207,00:17:55,00:17:58,"Look, I was just trying to help that chick out."
208,00:17:58,00:18:00,And then you helped yourself.
209,00:18:04,00:18:07,Uh-uh. Wasn't like that.
210,00:18:07,00:18:08,Are you saying you never touched her?
211,00:18:08,00:18:10,No way.
212,00:18:10,00:18:14,"I mean, yeah... the girl was ready to party."
213,00:18:14,00:18:16,"We had a couple drinks, and a smoke."
214,00:18:16,00:18:21,"She was definitely checking me out, but I'm a happily married man."
215,00:18:21,00:18:23,I just gave her a ride.
216,00:18:25,00:18:27,We already know what you did.
217,00:18:35,00:18:37,(bottle shatters)
218,00:18:40,00:18:43,Looks like you guys already got your answers.
219,00:18:43,00:18:45,Which means I want a lawyer.
220,00:18:46,00:18:49,BROWN: Bobby matched the bullets to the gun that was found at the scene.
221,00:18:49,00:18:51,He also ran a registration check.
222,00:18:51,00:18:54,Let me guess: Gun was clean.
223,00:18:54,00:18:56,"No, it was registered to Morgan Stewart."
224,00:18:56,00:18:59,"So, what, we're looking at a murder-suicide?"
225,00:18:59,00:19:01,Guy kills his family and then turns the gun on himself?
226,00:19:01,00:19:03,"Well, you know it's a possibility."
227,00:19:03,00:19:04,Brass pulled his financials.
228,00:19:05,00:19:06,Morgan Stewart was in debt up to his eyeballs.
229,00:19:07,00:19:09,He was in danger of losing his house.
230,00:19:09,00:19:12,Never underestimate the fragility of the male ego.
231,00:19:12,00:19:13,(wry laughter)
232,00:19:13,00:19:17,ROBBINS: Bullet enters with a marginal abrasion on the underside of the chin.
233,00:19:17,00:19:24,"The wound path traverses the oral cavity, brain, and the high scalp, just right of the mid-line."
234,00:19:24,00:19:29,Bullet exited with a stellate laceration in the right parietal scalp.
235,00:19:30,00:19:33,Mrs. Stewart...
236,00:19:33,00:19:35,Bullet penetrates the back.
237,00:19:35,00:19:44,"The hemorrhagic wound paths traverse the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the deep musculature on the right side of the back."
238,00:19:44,00:19:48,"Trajectory is back to front, right to left and slightly downward."
239,00:19:48,00:19:50,And what about the daughter?
240,00:20:01,00:20:03,Cause of death was drowning.
241,00:20:05,00:20:07,Any trauma to the body?
242,00:20:07,00:20:18,I noticed a fracture on the left fourth costosternal junction-- with virtually no hemorrhage-- caused by excessive pressure on the upper aspect of chest.
243,00:20:18,00:20:20,Broken rib.
244,00:20:20,00:20:22,"Now, I know the paramedics performed CPR..."
245,00:20:22,00:20:26,"Right, but the EMTs' report states that she already had the injury when they found her at the scene."
246,00:20:30,00:20:33,So maybe this all started with the accidental death of a child.
247,00:20:42,00:20:43,(cracking)
248,00:20:43,00:20:49,"WILLOWS: Wife tells her husband, whose mental state is already hanging by a thread..."
249,00:20:56,00:20:58,"Eh, that works."
250,00:20:58,00:21:03,Except how do you perform CPR on your child and then toss her back into the pool?
251,00:21:03,00:21:05,Did you get an I.D. on our arson victim yet?
252,00:21:06,00:21:09,"I ran the DNA through CODIS and Missing Persons, and I came up empty."
253,00:21:09,00:21:13,But one thing I do know is that one of her markers is out of the control range.
254,00:21:13,00:21:14,"""Off-ladder"" peak?"
255,00:21:14,00:21:19,"You talk the talk, but did you know the frequency of that anomaly is one in every 250?"
256,00:21:19,00:21:22,I learn something new every day around here.
257,00:21:57,00:21:59,GRISSOM: Mr. Matthews...
258,00:21:59,00:22:00,when was the last time you saw your wife?
259,00:22:00,00:22:02,"MATTHEWS: Last night, about 6:00."
260,00:22:02,00:22:03,SANDERS: She hasn't been home since?
261,00:22:03,00:22:06,No.
262,00:22:06,00:22:08,"We had a fight, she left."
263,00:22:08,00:22:09,It's happened before.
264,00:22:09,00:22:11,Do you have a lot of fights?
265,00:22:11,00:22:12,(sighs)
266,00:22:12,00:22:13,I don't know; what's a lot?
267,00:22:13,00:22:17,"Look, things have been a little rough for us lately."
268,00:22:17,00:22:20,Tara's been on anti-depressants for awhile.
269,00:22:21,00:22:23,"I own my own business, so she's home most of the time."
270,00:22:24,00:22:26,What's this all about? Where's my wife?
271,00:22:28,00:22:30,She's been in an accident.
272,00:22:33,00:22:35,I want to see her.
273,00:22:35,00:22:37,(monitor beeping)
274,00:22:50,00:22:52,"I don't know who that is, but..."
275,00:22:52,00:22:54,that's not my wife. That's not Tara.
276,00:22:56,00:22:57,Is this her ring?
277,00:23:03,00:23:05,"Oh, my God."
278,00:23:05,00:23:08,(crying)
279,00:23:08,00:23:09,Tara.
280,00:23:17,00:23:18,How did this happen?
281,00:23:19,00:23:22,We're still investigating.
282,00:23:25,00:23:28,All day...
283,00:23:28,00:23:30,I've been waiting for her to get home.
284,00:23:32,00:23:34,I was really going to make it up to her.
285,00:23:51,00:23:54,How'd it go at the hospital?
286,00:23:54,00:23:57,About as well as could be expected.
287,00:23:57,00:24:00,Doctors had to amputate the fingers from her right hand.
288,00:24:00,00:24:02,Too great a risk for infection.
289,00:24:02,00:24:06,They gave them tome to process for trace.
290,00:24:06,00:24:08,"You've pulled a double, Greg."
291,00:24:08,00:24:09,You need a break.
292,00:24:09,00:24:10,I'll process it.
293,00:24:15,00:24:16,Thanks.
294,00:24:54,00:24:56,Hey.
295,00:24:56,00:24:58,Hey.
296,00:25:01,00:25:02,What's the problem?
297,00:25:02,00:25:04,Nothing. I'm fine.
298,00:25:06,00:25:08,You're not.
299,00:25:09,00:25:12,I feel like a wuss.
300,00:25:12,00:25:17,"Grissom told me I should take a break, and I did."
301,00:25:18,00:25:19,Your burn victim.
302,00:25:21,00:25:23,How do you get an image like that out of your mind?
303,00:25:23,00:25:24,You go home.
304,00:25:24,00:25:26,"You, uh..."
305,00:25:26,00:25:29,"hug your cat, your dog, your pillow."
306,00:25:29,00:25:32,"You have a beer, you watch a movie, and then you come back tomorrow."
307,00:25:32,00:25:35,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
308,00:25:35,00:25:38,Rumor has it you used to be a pretty funny guy.
309,00:25:40,00:25:42,Don't lose that.
310,00:26:24,00:26:27,"It's hard to look and not touch, isn't it?"
311,00:26:27,00:26:29,That poor kid has been working her tail off.
312,00:26:29,00:26:34,"Only fair, considering how DNA gets most of the glory these days."
313,00:26:34,00:26:36,Have something for me?
314,00:26:36,00:26:37,Of course.
315,00:26:38,00:26:43,The dark hairs you found on Morgan Stewart's bed were not a match to his wife.
316,00:26:43,00:26:46,"Pretty bold, to bring another woman into his matrimonial bed."
317,00:26:46,00:26:47,Begging to get caught.
318,00:26:47,00:26:50,"Well, so far, you haven't told me anything I didn't already know."
319,00:26:50,00:26:54,This is the broken glass and paper found on the floor of the master bedroom.
320,00:26:54,00:26:56,"Uh, looks like a thermometer."
321,00:26:56,00:26:57,"Yes, but what kind?"
322,00:26:57,00:26:59,Do tell.
323,00:26:59,00:27:02,Notice how the gradations are broken down by tenths of a degree?
324,00:27:02,00:27:03,Yes.
325,00:27:03,00:27:05,And most thermometers aren't that specific.
326,00:27:05,00:27:06,Correct.
327,00:27:06,00:27:13,"It's a BBT, a basal body temperature thermometer, used by women to pinpoint a temperature spike that occurs..."
328,00:27:13,00:27:15,During ovulation. I know.
329,00:27:15,00:27:18,It maximizes your chance of conception. So...
330,00:27:18,00:27:20,"Corinne Stewart, I guess, was trying to have another baby."
331,00:27:20,00:27:23,With no clue as to what her husband was doing when she was out of the house.
332,00:27:24,00:27:25,Or with whom.
333,00:27:25,00:27:28,"Grissom-- hey, it's about your arson victim."
334,00:27:28,00:27:29,Greg beat you to it. I got an I.D.
335,00:27:29,00:27:32,"Yeah, well, I got something you don't have."
336,00:27:32,00:27:36,This is the standard ladder of alleles that I run against every unknown DNA.
337,00:27:36,00:27:40,and it contains all of the commonly encountered alleles within the population.
338,00:27:40,00:27:44,"As you can see, at locus D3 the alleles are 12 through 19."
339,00:27:44,00:27:45,Which is normal.
340,00:27:45,00:27:52,"Right. Now, as you can see on the sample on the bottom, the locus D3 alleles are 15 and 21."
341,00:27:52,00:27:53,Not normal.
342,00:27:53,00:27:56,The 21 allele is outside the normal range.
343,00:27:56,00:27:58,"An ""off-ladder"" peak."
344,00:27:58,00:27:59,Like Tara Matthews.
345,00:27:59,00:28:00,Right.
346,00:28:00,00:28:01,This is her profile.
347,00:28:01,00:28:03,Andthis...
348,00:28:04,00:28:09,is the DNA that was extracted from the vaginal contribution to the sheets at the Stewart house.
349,00:28:09,00:28:13,Tara Matthews' DNA in Morgan Stewart's bed.
350,00:28:13,00:28:15,We're working the same case.
351,00:28:18,00:28:23,There were several spots of high density polyethylene embedded in the fingers of Tara Matthews' right hand.
352,00:28:23,00:28:29,"SIDLE: According to Hodges, the material is consistent with the plastic tanks in most disposable lighters."
353,00:28:29,00:28:32,We found the top of one at the scene of the fire.
354,00:28:32,00:28:38,"Well, heat melts plastic and butane will explode under pressure."
355,00:28:38,00:28:40,WILLOWS: So the lighter blew up in her hand?
356,00:28:40,00:28:41,Are you saying that she...
357,00:28:41,00:28:43,set herself on fire?
358,00:28:52,00:28:54,It was attempted suicide.
359,00:28:54,00:28:57,She'd been assaulted by a truck driver shortly before her death.
360,00:28:57,00:28:58,She was clinically depressed.
361,00:28:58,00:29:00,She was having problems in her marriage.
362,00:29:00,00:29:04,"You know, some Eastern cultures believe that fire cleanses the soul."
363,00:29:04,00:29:08,"Well, Tara Matthews was having sex with Morgan Stewart."
364,00:29:08,00:29:15,"So, if she attempted suicide several hours after the Stewarts died, she's a possible suspect."
365,00:29:15,00:29:19,"Yeah, but just having her DNA in the bed doesn't prove she was there for the murders."
366,00:29:19,00:29:21,SIDLE: What about Tara's husband Neal?
367,00:29:21,00:29:25,"Well, according to Brass, Neal and Morgan were good friends since they were kids."
368,00:29:25,00:29:29,"Neal was good at making money, and Morgan was good at making debts."
369,00:29:29,00:29:34,"Maybe Morgan was jealous of Neal, sleeps with Tara out of spite, Corinne finds out..."
370,00:29:34,00:29:37,GRISSOM: And three people end up dead.
371,00:29:37,00:29:40,So the critical question remains.
372,00:29:40,00:29:50,"If Morgan shot himself, then he's the prime suspect in the murders, but if he, in fact, was murdered, then somebody else was in the house."
373,00:29:50,00:29:51,Mr. Matthews.
374,00:29:51,00:29:53,"Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
375,00:29:53,00:29:55,How's your wife doing?
376,00:29:55,00:29:57,How does it look like she's doing?
377,00:29:57,00:29:59,"You know, I just have a couple of questions."
378,00:30:00,00:30:01,Maybe we should talk outside.
379,00:30:01,00:30:03,We can talk here.
380,00:30:03,00:30:04,Okay.
381,00:30:04,00:30:10,"You know, when the detective interviewed you earlier, why didn't you tell him that your best friend and his family had just been killed?"
382,00:30:10,00:30:13,I didn't know then.
383,00:30:13,00:30:15,Were you at Morgan's house yesterday?
384,00:30:15,00:30:16,No.
385,00:30:16,00:30:18,How about your wife?
386,00:30:18,00:30:20,Not that I know of. Why would she?
387,00:30:20,00:30:22,"Well, she's been spending a lot of time there."
388,00:30:22,00:30:24,What's that supposed to mean?
389,00:30:24,00:30:26,Your wife was having an affair with your best friend.
390,00:30:26,00:30:29,"Look, I feel for you, Neal; I do."
391,00:30:29,00:30:33,Friends don't sleep with their friend's wives.
392,00:30:33,00:30:36,You think you know how I feel?
393,00:30:37,00:30:39,Guilty?
394,00:30:41,00:30:44,Yeah.
395,00:30:44,00:30:46,Idofeel guilty.
396,00:30:49,00:30:52,I was unable to give my wife what she needed.
397,00:30:52,00:30:56,"If she went to Morgan, that's the reason."
398,00:30:56,00:30:59,She never handled rejection well.
399,00:30:59,00:31:02,"So, if Morgan rejected her, how would she have taken that?"
400,00:31:02,00:31:04,Badly.
401,00:31:04,00:31:06,Bad enough to kill?
402,00:31:11,00:31:13,Not Tara.
403,00:31:26,00:31:27,How's it going?
404,00:31:27,00:31:28,Hey.
405,00:31:28,00:31:31,Checking out trajectory angles.
406,00:31:31,00:31:34,This is the shot comingoutof Morgan's body.
407,00:31:36,00:31:38,What's the trajectory going into the wall?
408,00:31:38,00:31:41,"Oh, the wall trajectory is a constant."
409,00:31:41,00:31:43,Morgan's is the variable here.
410,00:31:45,00:31:48,"Well, there's no way those lines are gonna match up with Morgan all the way over on the bed."
411,00:31:49,00:31:50,So let's make them line up.
412,00:31:58,00:32:01,Hang on. If he shot himself there...
413,00:32:01,00:32:03,how did he end up on the bed?
414,00:32:04,00:32:06,He was moved.
415,00:32:06,00:32:09,Where is the blood spatter from the initial wound?
416,00:32:09,00:32:10,Wait.
417,00:32:10,00:32:11,Morgan's wound bled out here.
418,00:32:11,00:32:15,The blood puddle covered the initial spatter.
419,00:32:17,00:32:18,(gunshot)
420,00:32:30,00:32:32,There was someone else in that room.
421,00:32:32,00:32:36,STOKES: So maybe Neal or Tara Matthews has blood on their clothes.
422,00:32:36,00:32:37,BROWN: Time to check the house.
423,00:33:58,00:33:59,(knocking)
424,00:34:00,00:34:03,You found a basal thermometer at the Stewart house?
425,00:34:03,00:34:04,Yeah.
426,00:34:04,00:34:06,It was crushed on the master bedroom floor. Why?
427,00:34:08,00:34:11,I found one in Tara Matthews' vanity drawer.
428,00:34:13,00:34:18,I was just looking at Corinne Stewart's autopsy report.
429,00:34:18,00:34:19,Uh...
430,00:34:19,00:34:21,"She had a tubal ligation, so..."
431,00:34:21,00:34:24,she obviously wasn't trying to have kids.
432,00:34:24,00:34:27,Tara was.
433,00:34:58,00:34:59,WILLOWS: So it's been confirmed.
434,00:34:59,00:35:01,Tara Matthews is pregnant.
435,00:35:01,00:35:04,Third-degree burns on most of her body and she doesn't miscarry?
436,00:35:05,00:35:07,A mother's body is designed to protect her baby.
437,00:35:07,00:35:11,"I don't know, all that trauma and morphine..."
438,00:35:11,00:35:14,it'll be a miracle if she brings it to term.
439,00:35:14,00:35:15,Do we have any idea who the father is?
440,00:35:15,00:35:17,Too early to tell.
441,00:35:17,00:35:18,She's just a few weeks pregnant.
442,00:35:18,00:35:21,"Okay, we know that Morgan and Tara were having sex."
443,00:35:22,00:35:27,"The broken basal thermometer we found in the bedroom implies that she was trying to conceive with him, and not her husband."
444,00:35:27,00:35:30,Neal could've been shooting blanks.
445,00:35:30,00:35:31,Medical records will confirm that.
446,00:35:32,00:35:35,And Neal and Morgan were best friends...
447,00:35:35,00:35:36,Somebody she may have felt comfortable with.
448,00:35:37,00:35:40,WILLOWS: Neal catches Morgan in bed with his wife...
449,00:35:44,00:35:46,He knows where the best friend keeps his gun.
450,00:35:47,00:35:50,The glass in Neal's shoe just puts him at the scene.
451,00:35:50,00:35:54,We didn't find any blood on the clothes we recovered from his house.
452,00:35:54,00:35:55,Clothes are easy to dump.
453,00:35:55,00:35:58,"The glass was an oversight, he didn't even know it was there."
454,00:35:58,00:35:59,Or maybe he didn't kill anybody.
455,00:35:59,00:36:01,Which leaves Tara.
456,00:36:01,00:36:02,There was no blood on her clothes either.
457,00:36:02,00:36:04,At least nothing at the house.
458,00:36:04,00:36:06,And the clothes she was wearing went up in flames.
459,00:36:10,00:36:11,Not everything.
460,00:37:00,00:37:02,"We got a problem, Neal."
461,00:37:02,00:37:06,We found chlorine from the Stewarts' pool on your wife's sweater.
462,00:37:06,00:37:08,That puts her at the scene.
463,00:37:08,00:37:11,We're going to be charging her with the murders.
464,00:37:15,00:37:17,Whatever happened...
465,00:37:17,00:37:19,Tara couldn't have done it on purpose.
466,00:37:19,00:37:21,It must've been some sort of accident.
467,00:37:21,00:37:27,"Well, the way we see it, you know, Tara went back to Morgan's house to tell him that she was pregnant with his child, and..."
468,00:37:27,00:37:30,"What, she told you the baby was yours?"
469,00:37:30,00:37:32,Yeah.
470,00:37:32,00:37:35,And you believed her?
471,00:37:35,00:37:37,We were trying to have a baby. Why wouldn't I?
472,00:37:37,00:37:39,"Oh, well, sure."
473,00:37:39,00:37:41,"I mean, you and Morgan are close enough in looks."
474,00:37:41,00:37:43,She probably would've gotten away with it.
475,00:37:43,00:37:51,She always said that a woman without a child of her own wasn't a woman.
476,00:37:51,00:37:54,We tried in vitro fertilization a half a dozen times.
477,00:37:54,00:37:55,"Yeah, we know."
478,00:37:55,00:37:56,We subpoenaed your medical records.
479,00:37:56,00:37:57,You had bad sperm.
480,00:37:59,00:38:00,Anyway...
481,00:38:00,00:38:06,"Tara went over to try to get Morgan to leave his family, he said no, she flipped out, she went nuts."
482,00:38:06,00:38:08,"She's got a history of depression, right? Total terror."
483,00:38:08,00:38:12,"I mean, I suppose Morgan got what he deserved."
484,00:38:12,00:38:16,But just because you're defective doesn't mean that Tara's gonna jump in bed with him.
485,00:38:16,00:38:19,I told Tara we could adopt.
486,00:38:19,00:38:21,She wouldn't.
487,00:38:21,00:38:24,And Corinne and the kid...
488,00:38:24,00:38:26,"wrong place, wrong time, I guess."
489,00:38:26,00:38:29,She wanted to have a family so bad...
490,00:38:29,00:38:31,"And you couldn't give it to her, so she took her business elsewhere."
491,00:38:31,00:38:33,And it didn't take long for Morgan to hit a home run...
492,00:38:33,00:38:35,Stop talking about it like that.
493,00:38:35,00:38:38,Just because she's lying burned up in a hospital room carrying your best friend's kid...
494,00:38:38,00:38:40,No! ...isn't going to cut it with the D.A.
495,00:38:40,00:38:42,"No, I'm... Look, Neal, Not another word. she killed three people."
496,00:38:43,00:38:44,I want you to shut up! Just shut up!
497,00:38:44,00:38:46,"Neal, please. Let's go. Go ahead and walk."
498,00:38:46,00:38:47,"Go ahead, let Tara take the fall."
499,00:38:47,00:38:49,She's probably not gonna make it anyway.
500,00:38:50,00:38:51,I love my wife.
501,00:38:51,00:38:52,"Please, Neal. Let's go."
502,00:38:52,00:38:53,We know you were there.
503,00:38:53,00:38:54,We got a fragment from a basal thermometer...
504,00:38:55,00:38:56,You don't know anything about her.
505,00:38:56,00:38:59,"I know she wanted a baby more than she wanted to be your wife, I know that much."
506,00:38:59,00:39:02,So tell me what I don't know.
507,00:39:07,00:39:12,"We were just hanging out, having a couple beers and I got a splinter."
508,00:39:12,00:39:16,Morgan said the tweezers were up in his bathroom.
509,00:39:23,00:39:26,He said it was Corinne's idea.
510,00:39:26,00:39:28,They were just trying to help us.
511,00:39:28,00:39:29,We did it for Tara.
512,00:39:30,00:39:31,You slept with my wife!
513,00:39:32,00:39:33,No!
514,00:39:38,00:39:40,Corinne! Call the police!
515,00:39:40,00:39:41,Mommy.
516,00:39:41,00:39:42,Morgan!
517,00:39:42,00:39:43,(gunshot)
518,00:39:46,00:39:47,(gunshot)
519,00:39:47,00:39:49,She ran.
520,00:39:49,00:39:50,She was going to call the cops.
521,00:39:50,00:39:52,I was just trying to stop her.
522,00:39:52,00:39:53,You shot her.
523,00:39:56,00:39:58,What about Dani?
524,00:40:00,00:40:02,"I didn't know what else to do, so I called Tara."
525,00:40:02,00:40:05,"When she came over, saw what I'd done..."
526,00:40:05,00:40:07,she just freaked out.
527,00:40:07,00:40:10,I made it look like Morgan shot Corinne and then he killed himself.
528,00:40:10,00:40:12,Are you out of your mind?
529,00:40:12,00:40:13,Do you know what you've done?
530,00:40:13,00:40:15,This is all because of you.
531,00:40:15,00:40:16,BRASS: Neal...
532,00:40:16,00:40:18,what happened to Dani?
533,00:40:20,00:40:22,Dani!
534,00:40:43,00:40:47,"She said we didn't deserve to live, neither one of us."
535,00:40:47,00:40:51,And then she just ran out the door.
536,00:40:51,00:40:54,I was afraid she was going to try to kill herself.
537,00:40:57,00:40:59,All we wanted was a baby.
