0,00:00:08,00:00:11,ROBBINS: Victim's name is Trevor Beck.
1,00:00:11,00:00:14,"Caucasian male, age 17."
2,00:00:14,00:00:17,"Five foot, 11."
3,00:00:17,00:00:20,154 pounds.
4,00:00:20,00:00:22,Senior at Sagebrush Valley High.
5,00:00:22,00:00:31,"Appears to be well nourished and in overall good health, without any abnormal skin coloring or pigmentation."
6,00:01:07,00:01:15,"There are several light abrasions and contusions on the knuckles of his right hand, consistent with a recent scuffle."
7,00:01:22,00:01:24,(no audible dialogue)
8,00:01:25,00:01:28,(indistinct yelling)
9,00:01:38,00:01:43,But there do not appear to be any external wounds consistent with severe trauma.
10,00:01:45,00:01:47,Internal organs appear healthy.
11,00:01:47,00:01:50,No signs of trauma or disease.
12,00:01:50,00:01:53,Heart muscle...
13,00:01:55,00:01:58,...is free of scarring and necrosis.
14,00:01:58,00:02:02,And there's no evidence of any cardiac event.
15,00:02:06,00:02:08,(sighs)
16,00:02:09,00:02:12,Healthy young men like this don't simply drop dead for no reason.
17,00:02:12,00:02:16,"I concur, which is why I am still looking."
18,00:02:19,00:02:21,Whoa! (Langston exclaims)
19,00:02:21,00:02:23,Oh!
20,00:02:23,00:02:26,That is one massive cerebral edema.
21,00:02:28,00:02:35,"The meninges don't appear to be discolored or inflamed, so I think we can safely rule out meningitis."
22,00:02:37,00:02:39,Did he suffer any blows to the head?
23,00:02:39,00:02:42,There's no evidence of any injuries to support that.
24,00:02:42,00:02:45,"According to the police report, he was shoved at school this morning and collapsed."
25,00:02:46,00:02:52,"And even if he sustained a blow during the altercation, that's not nearly enough time to cause this much swelling."
26,00:02:52,00:02:55,And what does that leave us with?
27,00:02:55,00:02:57,Drugs? Toxins?
28,00:02:58,00:03:00,Or a prior injury we don't know about.
29,00:03:02,00:03:05,Not yet.
30,00:03:37,00:03:39,"Mrs. Beck, please sit down."
31,00:03:39,00:03:40,(sniffling): Okay. Okay.
32,00:03:41,00:03:43,"Just-just a few things I have to ask you, all right?"
33,00:03:45,00:03:47,Was Trevor injured recently?
34,00:03:47,00:03:51,"""Injured""? How?"
35,00:03:51,00:03:54,"You know, uh... a bang in the head."
36,00:03:54,00:03:56,Even a little bump? Anything?
37,00:03:56,00:03:58,"MRS. BECK: No. No, I mean, not that I know of."
38,00:03:58,00:04:04,"BRASS: No? Was he complaining of, uh, headaches or blurred vision, nausea-- anything like that?"
39,00:04:04,00:04:07,"I-- you mean, he's been a little grumpy lately."
40,00:04:08,00:04:12,"I mean, this morning, he couldn't find his car keys, and he... he threw a fit."
41,00:04:12,00:04:16,"And then, he realized he'd left them in the car."
42,00:04:16,00:04:19,"But, um, I think that's just 'cause he's, he's not getting enough sleep, you know?"
43,00:04:19,00:04:21,He's... he's a teenager.
44,00:04:21,00:04:22,Sure. Sure.
45,00:04:22,00:04:24,"Sure, we all do that. I understand."
46,00:04:24,00:04:26,(Mrs. Beck sniffles)
47,00:04:28,00:04:29,Was he in a fight recently?
48,00:04:29,00:04:31,Trevor doesn't fight.
49,00:04:31,00:04:34,"He's a, um... he was a good kid."
50,00:04:34,00:04:36,"Well, even good kids have bad days."
51,00:04:39,00:04:42,Did somebody do something to Trevor...
52,00:04:42,00:04:46,"that, that killed him? We can't say anything definitive."
53,00:04:46,00:04:47,We're just looking at possibilities.
54,00:04:47,00:04:52,But it would be helpful to have a diary of Trevor's comings and goings in the last week.
55,00:04:52,00:04:53,That would be good.
56,00:04:53,00:04:56,How do you know anything about a kid at his age? I...
57,00:04:56,00:04:58,"BRASS: Well, we could ask his friends."
58,00:04:58,00:04:59,"You know, maybe they could help."
59,00:04:59,00:05:01,MRS. BECK: He didn't have a lot of friends.
60,00:05:01,00:05:08,"You know, when Trevor wasn't doing his schoolwork, he was, he was working on his car."
61,00:05:08,00:05:11,"You know, he always said that he was going to be an artist."
62,00:05:11,00:05:16,"I mean, I thought that would be like a, you know, a painter or sculptor or something, you know?"
63,00:05:16,00:05:19,Not a gearhead.
64,00:05:19,00:05:24,But he said that a car was art that could move.
65,00:05:24,00:05:27,(computer beeping)
66,00:05:28,00:05:30,He started seeing a girl.
67,00:05:30,00:05:33,Cindy. About a week ago.
68,00:05:33,00:05:35,She came home with him last night.
69,00:05:35,00:05:36,Yeah? What time was that?
70,00:05:36,00:05:39,"Let's see, they went up to Trevor's room about 9:00."
71,00:05:39,00:05:45,"But, um, there was no sleeping over, so she left about, uh, 11:00, I think."
72,00:05:45,00:05:47,But I-I didn't see her go.
73,00:05:47,00:05:48,Do you have her phone number?
74,00:05:48,00:05:51,No. I don't.
75,00:05:51,00:05:53,It's okay. It's all right.
76,00:05:53,00:05:55,We can find that. That's easy for us.
77,00:05:55,00:05:57,(line ringing)
78,00:05:57,00:06:01,"CINDY (on recording): Hey! If you want Cindy, well, too bad, 'cause you can't have her."
79,00:06:01,00:06:03,"(giggles, voice mail beeps)"
80,00:06:03,00:06:04,(phone beeps off)
81,00:06:04,00:06:06,(music plays over headphones)
82,00:06:08,00:06:11,You don't look nearly busy enough. (music stops)
83,00:06:11,00:06:12,"Well, thank you."
84,00:06:12,00:06:15,It is my gift to look relaxed while doing many things.
85,00:06:15,00:06:20,"Unlike Hodges, who has the ability to look overwhelmed while really doing nothing at all."
86,00:06:20,00:06:24,I'm waiting on an A.G. waiver on a cell phone for... WILLOWS: Cindy Warner.
87,00:06:24,00:06:29,"It just came through. Start ""relaxing."" You got it. Okay."
88,00:06:31,00:06:36,"You know, I heard the victim's brain kind of exploded in his head."
89,00:06:36,00:06:37,Kind of.
90,00:06:37,00:06:42,What does this girl have to do with that? No one's seen her since the night before Trevor Beck died.
91,00:06:42,00:06:46,"She lives with her brother, a construction worker out of town on a job."
92,00:06:46,00:06:50,I sent some unis over to their apartment for a welfare check and she wasn't there.
93,00:06:50,00:06:54,"I mean, her boyfriend drops dead in front of the whole school, and she's nowhere to be found."
94,00:06:54,00:06:56,That qualifies as suspicious to me.
95,00:06:56,00:06:57,Hmm. (computer beeps)
96,00:06:57,00:07:05,"Oh, okay. Her cell is registered and active at a tower on Washington Boulevard between Oak and Maple."
97,00:07:09,00:07:11,Sagebrush Valley High.
98,00:07:11,00:07:13,"Well, it is a school day."
99,00:07:16,00:07:19,"According to the office, Cindy was not in her homeroom this morning."
100,00:07:20,00:07:23,"WILLOWS (on phone): Well, according to my daughter, some kids just go to school to hang out."
101,00:07:23,00:07:24,Never set foot in a classroom.
102,00:07:24,00:07:26,"Oh, I have her schedule."
103,00:07:26,00:07:28,I will beat the bushes and see what turns up.
104,00:07:28,00:07:30,Bye.
105,00:07:35,00:07:37,Cindy?
106,00:07:38,00:07:41,Sorry? This is Cindy Warner's locker.
107,00:07:42,00:07:43,Yeah and mine. We share.
108,00:07:44,00:07:45,"Oh, uh, well, I'm Sara Sidle."
109,00:07:45,00:07:47,I'm with the crime lab. What's your name?
110,00:07:47,00:07:49,Renata Clarke.
111,00:07:49,00:07:51,"I'm going to need to get in there, Renata."
112,00:07:51,00:07:58,"Like the teachers say ""no expectation of privacy."" So did Cindy do something wrong?"
113,00:07:58,00:08:00,Have you seen her today? No.
114,00:08:00,00:08:02,"I mean, not since the other night."
115,00:08:02,00:08:05,"Actually, before what happened with Trevor."
116,00:08:05,00:08:07,And I've been texting her like crazy and Cindy's my biff.
117,00:08:08,00:08:09,We always talk before bed.
118,00:08:09,00:08:10,She text you back?
119,00:08:12,00:08:13,And you're not worried about her at all?
120,00:08:13,00:08:15,Of course I'm worried about her.
121,00:08:15,00:08:16,"Her boyfriend, like, died."
122,00:08:16,00:08:20,"But I mean, half the school went home after that and I figured Cindy did, too."
123,00:08:20,00:08:23,She just wasn't ready to talk.
124,00:08:23,00:08:26,And I can't even imagine how she was feeling.
125,00:08:29,00:08:32,You think Cindy ran away or something?
126,00:08:32,00:08:34,We don't know.
127,00:08:34,00:08:35,(school bell rings)
128,00:08:35,00:08:38,"Well, I'm going to be late for class."
129,00:08:38,00:08:39,"Oh, uh, no problem. Go ahead."
130,00:08:39,00:08:41,"But, um, could you do me a favor?"
131,00:08:41,00:08:46,"If Cindy does get in touch with you, could you call me please? Sure."
132,00:08:46,00:08:48,Thanks.
133,00:08:54,00:08:56,(indistinct chatter)
134,00:09:01,00:09:03,Hey! STOKES: Hi.
135,00:09:03,00:09:05,What are you doing here? I called Impound for this.
136,00:09:05,00:09:09,"Yeah, they're still sorting out a multi-car pileup on the 15."
137,00:09:09,00:09:10,Thought I'd save them some trouble.
138,00:09:10,00:09:12,Take care of this one in the field.
139,00:09:12,00:09:14,Nobody mentioned it was electric.
140,00:09:14,00:09:16,So?
141,00:09:16,00:09:18,So this is a 1958 Porsche Speedster.
142,00:09:18,00:09:20,So?
143,00:09:20,00:09:22,"So,it's a classic."
144,00:09:22,00:09:23,James Dean had one of these.
145,00:09:23,00:09:26,Putting an electric motor in this is sacrilegious.
146,00:09:26,00:09:27,Not to polar bears.
147,00:09:28,00:09:30,Did you process the interior?
148,00:09:30,00:09:32,"No, no, not yet."
149,00:09:32,00:09:34,Uh-oh.
150,00:09:34,00:09:36,Looks like we've got some more blasphemy here. Yeah.
151,00:09:36,00:09:39,I saw that fresh yellow paint scrape passenger's side door.
152,00:09:39,00:09:42,Already collected for trace. Hmm.
153,00:09:43,00:09:53,"You know, these EVs have diagnostic modules up the wazoo. They log range, speed, acceleration, state of charge-- all that stuff."
154,00:09:53,00:09:55,"Well, I guess the electric motor's good for us, too."
155,00:09:59,00:10:01,Phenelzine.
156,00:10:01,00:10:02,Antidepressant.
157,00:10:03,00:10:04,"Sadly, very popular with the high school set."
158,00:10:04,00:10:06,(beeping)
159,00:10:07,00:10:09,Got a pink cell here.
160,00:10:12,00:10:13,Cindy Warner's phone.
161,00:10:13,00:10:19,"They say the only way to get a teenage girl away from her cell phone is to pry it from her cold, dead hand."
162,00:10:19,00:10:23,"Well, whoever ""they"" are, let's hope they're wrong."
163,00:10:30,00:10:33,(computer beeps and whirs)
164,00:11:10,00:11:11,Ow! Let go!
165,00:11:11,00:11:13,What are you doing?!
166,00:11:13,00:11:14,What's the matter with you? Stop it!
167,00:11:14,00:11:15,"CINDY: Stop! Come on, man."
168,00:11:38,00:11:40,Miyamoto Takahashi?
169,00:11:40,00:11:42,"(sighs) Nah, man."
170,00:11:42,00:11:43,It's after 3:00.
171,00:11:43,00:11:44,I'm not a truant. Oh...
172,00:11:44,00:11:46,Wouldn't that be your lucky day?
173,00:11:46,00:11:48,"I'm a homicide detective, man."
174,00:11:50,00:11:52,How'd you get that shiner?
175,00:11:52,00:11:53,"(iPhone beeps, video plays) This'll help."
176,00:11:55,00:11:56,CINDY: Ow! TREVOR: Let go!
177,00:11:56,00:11:57,What are you doing?!
178,00:11:57,00:11:59,What's the matter with you? Stop it!
179,00:11:59,00:12:00,"CINDY: Stop! BOY: Come on, man!"
180,00:12:00,00:12:02,(video stops) Looks pretty self-explanatory.
181,00:12:02,00:12:05,"Boy, I don't know what's going on today, but everybody's giving me attitude. Hey, you know what?"
182,00:12:05,00:12:07,"I'm the victim, man."
183,00:12:07,00:12:12,"You're not the victim when the guy who did that, 17 hours later, ended up dead."
184,00:12:12,00:12:14,The gentleman in question died at school.
185,00:12:15,00:12:17,Probably bored to death.
186,00:12:17,00:12:20,"So what was your beef with Trevor? No beef, man."
187,00:12:20,00:12:21,Amateur got in my face.
188,00:12:21,00:12:24,I let him slide. A tough guy like you didn't hit back? Come on.
189,00:12:24,00:12:26,Let who's ever up decide.
190,00:12:26,00:12:29,"You know, for such a man of peace, you have a funny way of showing it."
191,00:12:29,00:12:30,You know what I think happened?
192,00:12:30,00:12:33,I think it all had to do with Cindy Warner.
193,00:12:34,00:12:35,I'm perplexed.
194,00:12:35,00:12:37,(chuckles) An educated guy like you?
195,00:12:38,00:12:39,Come on.
196,00:12:40,00:12:43,Cindy used to be my lady.
197,00:12:43,00:12:45,Then she started keeping his passenger seat warm.
198,00:12:47,00:12:50,But you never know when history's going to repeat itself-- that's the way I saw it.
199,00:12:50,00:12:55,"The way I see it is, uh, you get in a fight with Trevor to win Cindy back, and then Trevor kicked your ass."
200,00:12:55,00:12:58,"17 hours later, he ends up dead and Cindy goes missing."
201,00:13:01,00:13:03,She's missing?
202,00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
203,00:13:04,00:13:06,Where is she?
204,00:13:06,00:13:07,"If we knew where she was, she wouldn't be missing."
205,00:13:08,00:13:11,"Now, where did you go after Trevor decked you?"
206,00:13:11,00:13:13,Back here.
207,00:13:13,00:13:14,"Look, I swear. Ask my boss."
208,00:13:14,00:13:16,I was helping with inventory.
209,00:13:16,00:13:17,When was the last you saw Cindy?
210,00:13:17,00:13:19,You're looking at it.
211,00:13:19,00:13:22,STOKES: It looks like his brain stem has been jammed into his spine.
212,00:13:22,00:13:24,Essentially it has.
213,00:13:24,00:13:27,It's a rare condition known as Chiari malformation.
214,00:13:27,00:13:34,It's a deformity of the skull that displaces the cerebellum and the brain stem into the spinal canal.
215,00:13:34,00:13:40,Most people don't even realize they have it until they've experienced some kind of trauma or vigorous neck flexion.
216,00:13:40,00:13:42,Like a blow to the head? Exactly.
217,00:13:42,00:13:49,"If that happens, the condition creates swelling, edema, resulting in massive intracranial pressure."
218,00:13:49,00:13:54,"The headaches can be excruciating. WILLOWS: According to the mother, Trevor had been irritable."
219,00:13:54,00:13:55,And wasn't sleeping very well.
220,00:13:55,00:13:59,"It's got to be hard to sleep when your brain's blowing up in your skull like that, huh?"
221,00:13:59,00:14:03,"SIDLE: Trevor was also taking antidepressants, MAO inhibitors."
222,00:14:03,00:14:06,"I know they spike blood pressure, but wouldn't they have worsened the swelling?"
223,00:14:06,00:14:08,LANGSTON: Definitely.
224,00:14:08,00:14:16,"The existing Chiari, the antidepressants, and whatever struck his head, all combined to create an acute hypertensive crisis-- a perfect storm."
225,00:14:16,00:14:19,So whoever gave him the drugs was also contributing to his death.
226,00:14:19,00:14:24,Yes. WILLOWS: We still don't know what hit him or who or where it happened.
227,00:14:24,00:14:29,"Well, the diagnostic modules in Trevor's Franken-Porsche did give us a little something there."
228,00:14:29,00:14:38,"On the night before his last drive from home to school, Trevor drove about 14 miles in the course of an hour and a half without turning his engine off."
229,00:14:38,00:14:42,"That's seven miles out, seven miles back..."
230,00:14:42,00:14:44,Seven mile search radius.
231,00:14:44,00:14:48,And just before he made that trip is the last time that Cindy Warner was seen.
232,00:14:52,00:14:54,I've got a bad feeling about this.
233,00:16:08,00:16:11,"Guys, she's pretty messed up."
234,00:16:11,00:16:14,And it's not just from the tree.
235,00:16:14,00:16:16,Compound fractures of both shins.
236,00:16:16,00:16:18,A lot of internal injuries.
237,00:16:18,00:16:22,"And her uniform is missing the skirt, which could suggest sexual assault."
238,00:16:22,00:16:24,Possible body dump.
239,00:16:25,00:16:31,"You know, I haven't seen any blood in the vicinity or footprints, other than ours."
240,00:16:31,00:16:34,Or any sign of a struggle.
241,00:16:35,00:16:43,"No, if this is a body dump, and Trevor's death was some sort of twisted karmic retribution, then why didn't he try to hide the body any better than this?"
242,00:16:43,00:16:51,"There's no tire treads coming off the road, no signs of another vehicle even being out here, much less another person."
243,00:16:51,00:16:54,It's like she just... fell from the sky.
244,00:16:59,00:17:00,HODGES: What do you think?
245,00:17:00,00:17:05,Kids head out to the desert for a little sneaky-touchy.
246,00:17:05,00:17:08,"Things start getting hot and heavy, clothing is removed..."
247,00:17:08,00:17:11,"Then things go terribly, terribly wrong."
248,00:17:11,00:17:13,Definitely wrong.
249,00:17:13,00:17:15,That is not what happened.
250,00:17:15,00:17:18,Do you see how the tibia is snapped clean?
251,00:17:18,00:17:22,The X-ray shows the posterior is beveled.
252,00:17:22,00:17:24,This is a pedestrian fracture.
253,00:17:25,00:17:27,She was hit by a car.
254,00:17:29,00:17:31,David said that there was no evidence of that at the scene.
255,00:17:31,00:17:39,"Maybe not in the immediate vicinity of the body, but if you take a car traveling at highway speed and hit someone just right..."
256,00:17:39,00:17:45,A girl this size and this weight-- she could fly the length of a football field.
257,00:17:45,00:17:47,We need to widen our search.
258,00:18:27,00:18:29,(engines revving)
259,00:18:30,00:18:31,(Cindy screaming)
260,00:19:01,00:19:04,(shutter clicks)
261,00:19:04,00:19:16,"STOKES: There were yaw marks up and down the road, but no clear tread marks, so I obliquely photographed areas where I thought tread marks might be by using a light source at different angles, different contrast..."
262,00:19:16,00:19:20,Each angle revealed portions of otherwise invisible treads.
263,00:19:20,00:19:24,"By layering the shots, I was able to come up with a complete set of tread mark impressions."
264,00:19:24,00:19:27,"Very impressive, smarty-pants. (chuckles)"
265,00:19:27,00:19:30,Two distinct sets.
266,00:19:32,00:19:35,Both originating in the same general vicinity...
267,00:19:35,00:19:37,here.
268,00:19:37,00:19:46,"The yellow scrapes and blood on the road appear to be from Cindy's point of impact, which was roughly 1,300 feet from the starting point."
269,00:19:46,00:19:50,We found her body 300 feet from where she was hit.
270,00:19:50,00:19:55,"Two cars, dead of night, a girl on a lonely stretch of quarter-mile straightaway."
271,00:19:55,00:19:57,This was a drag race.
272,00:19:58,00:19:59,(muted cheering)
273,00:19:59,00:20:01,(tires screeching)
274,00:20:02,00:20:03,(screaming)
275,00:20:03,00:20:05,With Cindy at the finish line...
276,00:20:05,00:20:07,in every sense of the word.
277,00:20:08,00:20:14,The treads on the left are a thin five-bar tire that's consistent with the ones on Trevor's car.
278,00:20:14,00:20:18,The treads on the right are from his mystery opponent.
279,00:20:18,00:20:22,"They're 17-inch, Goodyear Eagles with a wheel width of approximately 70 inches."
280,00:20:22,00:20:25,STOKES: A lot of cars on the road today that fit that description.
281,00:20:26,00:20:30,Hodges was able to I.D. the yellow flakes in Cindy's wounds and the point of impact.
282,00:20:30,00:20:32,It's Flatz uranium number two.
283,00:20:32,00:20:37,"And it is the same paint as the yellow scrape that we found on Trevor's door. Okay, so..."
284,00:20:38,00:20:41,"the two cars race, one swipes the other."
285,00:20:41,00:20:46,The yellow car loses control and takes out Cindy.
286,00:20:46,00:20:49,That would explain why there was no damage to the front-end of Trevor's car.
287,00:20:49,00:20:53,So we're looking for a yellow street racer in Las Vegas? Great.
288,00:20:53,00:20:55,That should narrow it down to just a few hundred suspects.
289,00:20:56,00:20:58,"Well, maybe Trevor's drug dealer can help us out with that."
290,00:20:58,00:21:02,I tracked the lot number on the phenelzine pack you found.
291,00:21:02,00:21:04,It's from a local pharmacy. I called the owner.
292,00:21:04,00:21:08,His son works as a stock boy andhe goes to Trevor's school.
293,00:21:09,00:21:10,BOY: A drug dealer?
294,00:21:10,00:21:12,Me?
295,00:21:12,00:21:14,Do I look like Tony Montoya to you?
296,00:21:15,00:21:16,"Damn it, Rishi, stop messing around."
297,00:21:16,00:21:18,That's good advice.
298,00:21:18,00:21:20,We know that you're dealing.
299,00:21:20,00:21:22,I never took any cash from Trevor.
300,00:21:24,00:21:26,We were in auto shop together.
301,00:21:26,00:21:33,"He was like a genius, and I have this mental blockage when it comes to things mechanical, so I exchanged my goods for his services."
302,00:21:33,00:21:35,Tutoring.
303,00:21:35,00:21:37,"All this and you're failing auto shop, too?"
304,00:21:37,00:21:39,"That's right, Dad!"
305,00:21:39,00:21:41,I'm never going to be an engineer.
306,00:21:41,00:21:43,Strip me of my Indian.
307,00:21:43,00:21:45,The night before he died...
308,00:21:45,00:21:47,who was Trevor racing?
309,00:21:47,00:21:49,No one. Come on.
310,00:21:49,00:21:51,"I'm telling you, Trevor wasn't a racer."
311,00:21:51,00:21:53,Tell the police the truth!
312,00:21:54,00:21:56,He wasn't a racer!
313,00:21:56,00:21:58,Not as far I know.
314,00:21:59,00:22:03,"That car was like his baby. Well, racing is what a car like that is built for."
315,00:22:03,00:22:09,"We know that Trevor was out in the desert drag racing a yellow car, which killed Cindy Warner."
316,00:22:11,00:22:14,Do you know somebody with a yellow car?
317,00:22:18,00:22:21,I don't think you're aware of what's going on here.
318,00:22:21,00:22:24,The pills that you gave Trevor helped kill him.
319,00:22:25,00:22:28,"No-no-no, he... he asked me for the painkillers."
320,00:22:28,00:22:30,"But that stuff's addictive, so I gave him the uppers."
321,00:22:30,00:22:32,Which are controlled substances.
322,00:22:32,00:22:34,Trafficking them is a felony.
323,00:22:35,00:22:37,"Hey, I'm still a minor."
324,00:22:37,00:22:38,But your father isn't.
325,00:22:38,00:22:41,He's responsible for those medications.
326,00:22:41,00:22:45,"And if he's found criminally liable, he could lose his store."
327,00:22:47,00:22:49,"Oh, my God."
328,00:22:50,00:22:52,"Oh, my God."
329,00:22:52,00:22:53,"Rishi, what have you done?"
330,00:22:56,00:23:00,The yellow car...
331,00:23:00,00:23:02,it's got to be a Demon.
332,00:23:02,00:23:04,They're a gang. Their color's yellow. That's all I know.
333,00:23:04,00:23:06,I swear.
334,00:23:07,00:23:08,"I'm sorry, Dad."
335,00:23:09,00:23:10,I'm sorry.
336,00:23:12,00:23:13,BRASS: The Demons have been around for awhile.
337,00:23:13,00:23:20,"They're a legitimate car club, but they've diversified into distribution of narcotics, chop shops, protection rackets-- things like that."
338,00:23:20,00:23:23,"Well, we can't exactly round up every Demon in town who's driving a yellow car, can we?"
339,00:23:24,00:23:25,"Well, maybe we don't have to."
340,00:23:25,00:23:28,I know where a lot of Demons are going to hang out tonight.
341,00:23:48,00:23:50,"SIDLE: ""Street Rumble""? That's catchy."
342,00:23:50,00:23:55,Brass says the department sets this thing up to keep racers off the streets.
343,00:23:55,00:24:00,"Ten dollars buys anyone into a race, and it's all legal."
344,00:24:00,00:24:01,"Well, it looks like it's working."
345,00:24:01,00:24:03,"Yeah, it does, actually."
346,00:24:03,00:24:05,"Well, at least one day a week anyway."
347,00:24:06,00:24:09,(man speaking indistinctly over P.A.)
348,00:24:11,00:24:13,Here we go. Check it out.
349,00:24:15,00:24:18,Pretty nice ride you got here.
350,00:24:25,00:24:27,17-inch rims?
351,00:24:27,00:24:29,"Ooh, look at that."
352,00:24:29,00:24:31,The lady can appreciate the finer things in life.
353,00:24:31,00:24:32,Nissan 350Z.
354,00:24:32,00:24:34,This is a race car.
355,00:24:34,00:24:37,You can't keep it caged up. You got to let a canary sing.
356,00:24:37,00:24:39,Ask Sergeant Jenkins.
357,00:24:39,00:24:40,This is the ride that beat his ass here last week.
358,00:24:40,00:24:42,"Bumper looks a little beat up, though."
359,00:24:42,00:24:44,This baby's pristine.
360,00:24:44,00:24:46,You know Officer O'Malley?
361,00:24:46,00:24:48,Got smoked two weeks ago on Las Vegas...
362,00:24:48,00:24:49,On the track.
363,00:24:51,00:24:53,Your old Crown Vic's just no matchup.
364,00:24:53,00:24:58,"Hey, no disrespect, but any scratches get on that shine, there's going to be problems, man."
365,00:24:58,00:24:59,"No, there's not."
366,00:24:59,00:25:02,"Besides, I was just admiring the color. Weren't you, Sara?"
367,00:25:02,00:25:04,The color is nice. What is it?
368,00:25:04,00:25:06,"Uh, Flatz uranium number two?"
369,00:25:06,00:25:08,Don't know.
370,00:25:08,00:25:10,Is this your car?
371,00:25:10,00:25:11,I'm watching it for a friend.
372,00:25:11,00:25:13,What's this about? What's your friend's name?
373,00:25:13,00:25:14,Don't know.
374,00:25:14,00:25:17,"You don't know the guy's name, but he lets you baby-sit his car? Why is that?"
375,00:25:17,00:25:19,What can I say? I got a trustworthy face.
376,00:25:19,00:25:23,"No, you don't. We're looking for a yellow car in connection with a murder."
377,00:25:27,00:25:29,SARA: Mitch!
378,00:25:29,00:25:30,Johnnie! We got a runner!
379,00:25:33,00:25:35,"Stop, LVPD! Stop now!"
380,00:25:35,00:25:36,Step aside! Please!
381,00:25:39,00:25:40,LVPD! Stop!
382,00:25:42,00:25:43,Get out of the way!
383,00:25:43,00:25:45,SIDLE: Back it up! Get down on the ground!
384,00:25:45,00:25:48,Now! Get down. Get your arm back.
385,00:25:48,00:25:49,Get down!
386,00:25:49,00:25:51,Back it up!
387,00:25:51,00:25:53,Maybe in your car you would've had a chance.
388,00:25:53,00:25:54,(grunts)
389,00:25:54,00:25:56,You're under arrest. Get him up.
390,00:25:56,00:25:58,Let's go.
391,00:26:11,00:26:13,Oh...
392,00:26:16,00:26:17,"What is it, Greg?"
393,00:26:17,00:26:19,I was just thinking about the time I went joyriding.
394,00:26:19,00:26:22,You? Really?
395,00:26:22,00:26:23,I was 12.
396,00:26:23,00:26:27,My Papa Olaf bought a red 280-ZX.
397,00:26:27,00:26:30,"Man, it was love at first sight."
398,00:26:30,00:26:34,And I have no idea what made me think I could get away with it.
399,00:26:34,00:26:41,"But when Papa O went down for his afternoon nap, I swiped the keys and took it for a spin."
400,00:26:41,00:26:43,Where'd you go?
401,00:26:43,00:26:46,Around the block-- twice.
402,00:26:46,00:26:50,"And when I was rolling it back into the driveway, I almost ran over my foot."
403,00:26:51,00:26:53,"Papa Olaf woke up, had no idea."
404,00:26:53,00:26:55,He never found out.
405,00:26:55,00:26:58,Hmm... you're a little car thief.
406,00:26:58,00:27:00,"Yeah, guess I am."
407,00:27:02,00:27:05,"So, listen, Miyamoto lawyered up."
408,00:27:05,00:27:09,"But according to the guys in the gang unit, he's been involved in stuff like this before."
409,00:27:09,00:27:15,"He got busted in a chop shop raid last summer, but since he was a juvee, and not principally involved, they turned him loose."
410,00:27:15,00:27:18,"I'm pretty sure he's involved in this, too."
411,00:27:18,00:27:20,"Well, unfortunately, his car isn't."
412,00:27:20,00:27:26,"Well, his wheel width matches, so do the tires."
413,00:27:26,00:27:30,And Hodges confirmed the paint-- Flatz uranium number two.
414,00:27:30,00:27:37,"That may be so, but while at the crime scene, I collected broken glass associated with the impact."
415,00:27:37,00:27:39,It turned out to be headlight glass.
416,00:27:39,00:27:42,These headlights are plastic.
417,00:27:42,00:27:47,There is no way that this glass came from that car.
418,00:27:59,00:28:00,(indistinct chatter from video)
419,00:28:06,00:28:07,WILLOWS: Is that Trevor?
420,00:28:09,00:28:12,Looks like he was more of a racer than people thought.
421,00:28:12,00:28:13,Where did you get to this?
422,00:28:13,00:28:16,"Well, that photo was on Cindy's phone."
423,00:28:16,00:28:21,"It was taken at the winner's circle of Street Rumble, so I searched their site and this came up. It's from nine days ago."
424,00:28:21,00:28:24,WILLOWS: Check out that paint job on the other car.
425,00:28:24,00:28:27,Yellow flames.
426,00:28:27,00:28:29,How much do you want to bet it's Flatz uranium number two?
427,00:28:37,00:28:39,(tires screeching)
428,00:28:39,00:28:41,WILLOWS: Ouch.
429,00:28:41,00:28:43,He got whiplashed in that spinout.
430,00:28:45,00:28:47,That's probably what setoff his Chiari.
431,00:28:47,00:28:50,Which means that his death was probably an accident.
432,00:28:50,00:28:53,Yeah.
433,00:29:01,00:29:03,Wait a minute.
434,00:29:05,00:29:07,That is Renata Clarke.
435,00:29:07,00:29:09,Cindy Warner's best friend.
436,00:29:09,00:29:12,"So, Trevor smokes Renata in an organized race."
437,00:29:12,00:29:15,Maybe the desert was a rematch.
438,00:29:18,00:29:20,"(engine revs, ticks)"
439,00:29:22,00:29:25,"All right, you hear that light ticking sound?"
440,00:29:26,00:29:28,That's the hot solid lifter cam.
441,00:29:28,00:29:30,The valves need adjusting.
442,00:29:30,00:29:34,"Shut it down. See, if you listen, your car will tell you everything."
443,00:29:34,00:29:36,There's no guesswork.
444,00:29:36,00:29:42,"Unlike your girlfriend, she'll tell you exactly what she means, but you have to listen, because..."
445,00:29:44,00:29:47,"If you don't, your car's just a noisy heap of metal."
446,00:29:47,00:29:49,"So take care of those valves. Okay, Gus."
447,00:29:49,00:29:51,Hi. Can I help you?
448,00:29:51,00:29:53,Hi there. Mr. Davis? Yes.
449,00:29:53,00:29:56,We're with the crime lab.
450,00:29:56,00:29:58,I understand that you're Renata's legal guardian.
451,00:29:58,00:30:02,I am. I'm her uncle and her shop teacher.
452,00:30:02,00:30:04,We're going to need to take a look at her car.
453,00:30:04,00:30:09,"Sure. Uh, yeah, it's right over here, only it's not for sale."
454,00:30:09,00:30:11,Renata? Come on out.
455,00:30:11,00:30:14,"Uh, these people want to take a look at the car."
456,00:30:17,00:30:19,"What's this all about, Gus?"
457,00:30:19,00:30:20,I don't know.
458,00:30:24,00:30:26,No signs of blood spatter or body damage.
459,00:30:26,00:30:28,Even the tires look clean.
460,00:30:28,00:30:30,But the headlightsareglass.
461,00:30:35,00:30:36,"Well, the wheel width is right."
462,00:30:36,00:30:38,SIDLE: There's no way we're off base on this.
463,00:30:43,00:30:44,Maybe we're not.
464,00:30:44,00:30:47,Check it out.
465,00:30:47,00:30:50,Yellow paint overspray.
466,00:30:50,00:30:52,This area's been recently repaired and repainted.
467,00:30:56,00:30:58,What are you looking for?
468,00:31:00,00:31:01,Renata...
469,00:31:01,00:31:04,where were you the night that Cindy went missing?
470,00:31:04,00:31:08,"Um, I went to Giant Burger to meet up with some friends for dinner."
471,00:31:08,00:31:10,"When the fries got cold, I came home."
472,00:31:10,00:31:12,Studied calc and fell asleep on my textbook.
473,00:31:12,00:31:14,True story.
474,00:31:14,00:31:16,What were you calling Cindy about at 1:00 in the morning?
475,00:31:16,00:31:19,"Around midnight, I woke up, ink on my face and everything."
476,00:31:19,00:31:23,I watched theGossip GirlI DVR'd and called Cindy to go over the pertinent details.
477,00:31:23,00:31:24,Did you made plans to meet up?
478,00:31:24,00:31:26,"""Meet up""?"
479,00:31:26,00:31:27,There's no meeting up.
480,00:31:27,00:31:29,Cindy and I talk every night.
481,00:31:29,00:31:31,This is nothing out of the ordinary.
482,00:31:31,00:31:33,Wait.
483,00:31:33,00:31:36,You couldn't possibly think I was there when Cindy...
484,00:31:36,00:31:38,When Cindy what? You think I killed her?
485,00:31:39,00:31:41,Cindy was my best friend!
486,00:31:41,00:31:42,I would never hurt her!
487,00:31:42,00:31:43,Never! Renata.
488,00:31:43,00:31:44,What's this all about?
489,00:31:44,00:31:48,"Evidence consistent with this car was collected at a crime scene, Mr. Davis."
490,00:31:48,00:31:51,This vehicle will now be impounded.
491,00:31:51,00:31:54,Impound? What? Because of some stupid measuring tape?
492,00:31:54,00:31:55,You can't take it!
493,00:31:55,00:31:58,You can't let them take my car! You don't actually have a choice in the matter.
494,00:31:58,00:31:59,Okay. Fine. Look.
495,00:31:59,00:32:01,She was at home.
496,00:32:01,00:32:02,I was with her.
497,00:32:02,00:32:04,And we're done talking.
498,00:32:19,00:32:27,"Okay, you guys are looking for fibers blood, hair-- any transfer that would confirm this is the vehicle that struck and killed Cindy Warner, okay?"
499,00:32:27,00:32:33,"The suspect hides the murder weapon in plain sight, in her auto shop class."
500,00:32:33,00:32:35,That's pretty sophisticated for a high school girl. Right.
501,00:32:35,00:32:39,She's definitely more sophisticated than the ones you chat with on theTwilightmessage boards.
502,00:32:41,00:32:42,"Wait, wait."
503,00:32:42,00:32:47,"So, I'm guessing that about a million grubby teenagers probably pawed their way all around this thing."
504,00:32:47,00:32:51,So how exactly do we put Renata behind the wheel when Cindy was killed?
505,00:32:51,00:32:53,By going over it with a fine-tooth comb.
506,00:32:53,00:32:57,"If we can rule out other drivers, then we can build a pretty good case. Right."
507,00:32:57,00:32:59,What if the other driver was wearing gloves?
508,00:32:59,00:33:03,"Helping or hindering, Wendy, which one's it going to be?"
509,00:33:03,00:33:04,I am helping.
510,00:33:04,00:33:06,Attagirl. Thanks.
511,00:33:07,00:33:08,(shutter clicks)
512,00:33:11,00:33:12,SIMMS: What do you got there?
513,00:33:16,00:33:18,Kids. Gross.
514,00:33:18,00:33:22,SIDLE: There are only two ways to get to the drag where Cindy was killed.
515,00:33:22,00:33:24,One is an exit off the 95. Mm-hmm.
516,00:33:24,00:33:28,"And the other's a turn off Blue Diamond Road, which is the way to get there from Henderson."
517,00:33:28,00:33:31,And where both Trevor and Renata live.
518,00:33:31,00:33:37,Is there a traffic camera or video surveillance at the Blue Diamond intersection? I am just going to check that out.
519,00:33:37,00:33:39,Good. PDs doing their part.
520,00:33:39,00:33:42,Somebody's bound to get lucky.
521,00:33:42,00:33:45,This is a 1933 Ford Roadster.
522,00:33:45,00:33:49,It was involved in a street race that resulted in the death of a teenage girl.
523,00:33:49,00:33:57,"Now, we have reason to believe that the street gang known as the Demons aided the driver by chopping the parts of this car immediately after the incident."
524,00:33:57,00:34:04,"Now, the gang unit has supplied you with a list of the known Demon chop shops, several of which are fronted by legitimate businesses."
525,00:34:04,00:34:08,"Now, the job is to locate and recover any and all parts from this vehicle."
526,00:34:08,00:34:10,"And when you do so, give CSI a call."
527,00:35:09,00:35:14,Cindy Warner's sweater made quite the impression on the hood of Renata's car.
528,00:35:14,00:35:16,(screaming)
529,00:35:16,00:35:26,"There was so much kinetic energy transferred in the collision that when the fabric came into contact with the hood, it actually deformed the clear coat and the paint."
530,00:35:26,00:35:32,"After that, she takes the car to the Demons who replace the parts and paint everything to match."
531,00:35:32,00:35:34,And she pretends the whole thing didn't happen.
532,00:35:34,00:35:36,Were there any other prints besides hers on the steering wheel?
533,00:35:37,00:35:39,"No. No, we got her as good as we can."
534,00:35:39,00:35:41,"You know, there's one thing that I still don't get."
535,00:35:41,00:35:51,"So, Renata loses to Trevor in a legal, organized race, and then a week later, they have a rematch at an illegal drag in the desert."
536,00:35:51,00:35:53,Why not just wait until the next Rumble?
537,00:35:54,00:35:56,Racer mentality runs in her family.
538,00:35:56,00:36:00,Her guardian was on the stock car circuit in the '70s.
539,00:36:00,00:36:01,Made a bit of a name for himself.
540,00:36:01,00:36:05,"Back then, guys used to build their own cars and race them for pink slips."
541,00:36:05,00:36:07,He obviously passed the bug on to Renata.
542,00:36:07,00:36:09,"Uh, guys, we got a problem."
543,00:36:09,00:36:14,These were taken by a traffic camera on Blue Diamond Road the night of Cindy's death.
544,00:36:14,00:36:18,STOKES: That's Trevor's Porsche with Renata behind the wheel.
545,00:36:18,00:36:19,That doesn't make any sense.
546,00:36:19,00:36:20,It blows up our whole theory.
547,00:36:20,00:36:21,Trevor wasn't in the desert.
548,00:36:21,00:36:23,It wasn't a rematch.
549,00:36:23,00:36:27,So then what-- he let Renata borrow his car to... what?
550,00:36:27,00:36:28,Race who?
551,00:36:29,00:36:30,Her car was already there.
552,00:36:30,00:36:32,STOKES: We're missing something.
553,00:36:32,00:36:34,"SIDLE: Okay, but what?"
554,00:36:39,00:36:40,I think I know.
555,00:36:40,00:36:43,(gum rattles)
556,00:36:45,00:36:47,Want a piece of gum?
557,00:36:48,00:36:50,"Piece of gum, Gus?"
558,00:36:53,00:36:55,"We know you didn't race Trevor in the desert, Renata."
559,00:36:57,00:37:00,Finally. It was starting to feel like harassment.
560,00:37:00,00:37:02,You were racing each other.
561,00:37:04,00:37:07,We found a wad of chewing gum stuck on the back of the steering wheel of Renata's car.
562,00:37:07,00:37:09,I know you're a fan of Chuck Yeager's. So am I.
563,00:37:09,00:37:14,Chuck used to snag a stick of Beeman from his mechanic before he did a test flight.
564,00:37:14,00:37:16,"And then he'd take the gum, right?"
565,00:37:16,00:37:19,And he'd place it...
566,00:37:19,00:37:21,right on the cockpit.
567,00:37:21,00:37:25,So it'd be there on his safe return home.
568,00:37:25,00:37:29,"And I guess that in your racing days, you'd leave a wad of gum on the steering wheel?"
569,00:37:29,00:37:30,Just like Chuck.
570,00:37:32,00:37:37,"Well, once we match your DNA to that chewing gum, it's like the checkered flag for us."
571,00:37:37,00:37:39,"So, I chew gum."
572,00:37:39,00:37:42,Renata and I work together on that car all the time.
573,00:37:42,00:37:43,That doesn't prove anything.
574,00:37:43,00:37:51,"The morning that Trevor died, he couldn't find his car keys, but he said found them later inside his car."
575,00:37:51,00:37:59,So I think that you got your BFF Cindy to steal the car and bring it out the desert so you could race it.
576,00:37:59,00:38:06,"And after Cindy got killed, you drove the car back into Trevor's house and left the keys inside the car."
577,00:38:18,00:38:20,He...
578,00:38:21,00:38:25,"We, we didn't mean to... We didn't do anything."
579,00:38:25,00:38:26,And we're leaving.
580,00:38:26,00:38:28,"No, you're not leaving. Well, wait a minute."
581,00:38:28,00:38:31,"Actually, you can leave."
582,00:38:31,00:38:32,But you're going to stay.
583,00:38:32,00:38:34,You're under arrest.
584,00:38:34,00:38:35,Cuff her. Read her her rights.
585,00:38:36,00:38:37,Charge is felony murder. She were there.
586,00:38:37,00:38:39,"You want to give her a hug, buddy, now's a good time."
587,00:38:39,00:38:41,"No, wait. N-now stop! RENATA: It's okay, Gus."
588,00:38:41,00:38:42,I'm going to be okay. No.
589,00:38:43,00:38:43,Don't.
590,00:38:44,00:38:46,It's my fault. Don't!
591,00:38:47,00:38:49,It was my fault.
592,00:38:49,00:38:51,(cheering)
593,00:38:53,00:38:54,What the hell happened out there?
594,00:38:55,00:39:00,That guy's never raced a day in his life and he beat you?! His car runs like it's on jet fuel. There's no beating that.
595,00:39:00,00:39:01,You were slow on your gear changes.
596,00:39:01,00:39:06,"If you had the guts of a real racer you would've beat him! His car is better than ours, Gus."
597,00:39:06,00:39:08,Get over it!
598,00:39:09,00:39:14,I saw Trevor's little toaster all the time in class.
599,00:39:14,00:39:16,It's not about what's under the hood.
600,00:39:16,00:39:22,And I had to show Renata that what matters most is the heart behind the wheel.
601,00:39:22,00:39:24,Cindy was dating Trevor.
602,00:39:26,00:39:31,I got Renata to convince Cindy to steal Trevor's car.
603,00:39:31,00:39:35,so I could prove my point.
604,00:39:46,00:39:47,I don't know what came over me.
605,00:39:48,00:39:51,I just never liked to lose to anyone.
606,00:39:57,00:39:59,(Cindy screaming)
607,00:39:59,00:40:01,RENATA: Cindy!
608,00:40:01,00:40:04,Cindy! Get in the car! Get in the car!
609,00:40:04,00:40:06,"(panting, crying)"
610,00:40:06,00:40:07,No! We have to find her!
611,00:40:08,00:40:09,"All right, I will, but I want you out of here."
612,00:40:09,00:40:11,Take Trevor's car back and go home.
613,00:40:18,00:40:22,I tried.
614,00:40:22,00:40:24,"I tried to find her, but I couldn't."
615,00:40:29,00:40:31,But I felt that hit.
616,00:40:33,00:40:36,There was nothing I could do for her.
617,00:40:37,00:40:44,I gave that Miyamoto kid 500 bucks to make the car like new overnight.
618,00:40:47,00:40:48,This is on me.
619,00:40:48,00:40:51,RENATA (crying): No.
620,00:40:51,00:40:53,It was my fault.
621,00:40:53,00:40:58,"If I hadn't had Cindy steal Trevor's car, she never would have been out there in the first place."
622,00:40:58,00:40:59,You did.
623,00:41:00,00:41:02,She was.
624,00:41:02,00:41:04,Who won?
625,00:41:08,00:41:11,WILLOWS: Brass said the D.A.'s going to charge them both.
626,00:41:11,00:41:15,"STOKES: There you go-- two lives ruined, two dead kids and for what?"
627,00:41:15,00:41:18,So some old-time race car driver could show off?
628,00:41:18,00:41:19,It's a shame.
629,00:41:19,00:41:21,"When you're young, you think you're immortal."
630,00:41:21,00:41:24,"And when you get older, you just want to remember how that felt."
631,00:41:25,00:41:28,Driving crazy fast on an open road.
632,00:41:28,00:41:30,"We're not getting that old, are we? (chuckles)"
633,00:41:30,00:41:31,"Good night, Nicky."
634,00:41:31,00:41:33,"Good night, Catherine. I'll see you tomorrow."
