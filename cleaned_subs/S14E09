0	00:00:19	00:00:21	911 operator. What's your emergency?
1	00:00:21	00:00:22	I'm at the Sky View Motel.
2	00:00:22	00:00:25	I was making a delivery. You have to send someone.
3	00:00:25	00:00:27	I think they're dead. I don't know for sure, but... Slow down, sir.
4	00:00:27	00:00:28	You need to tell me what happened.
5	00:00:28	00:00:30	Are there people injured?
6	00:00:30	00:00:31	There's blood. There's blood everywhere.
7	00:00:34	00:00:35	(sighs wearily) Well, it's a messy one.
8	00:00:35	00:00:44	If you don't believe me, ask the pizza Yeah, is he the one who called it in? Yeah, he was delivering pizzas to, uh, one of the rooms nearby.
9	00:00:44	00:00:46	The door to 114 was ajar, so he looked in.
10	00:00:46	00:00:49	What do we have? Two victims.
11	00:00:49	00:00:51	Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Oh, that's original.
12	00:00:51	00:00:52	Anybody know who they really are?
13	00:00:52	00:00:53	No.
14	00:00:53	00:00:55	And I don't know what they did to deserve this.
15	00:01:10	00:01:14	...63... 64... 65...
16	00:01:14	00:01:17	66, 67...
17	00:01:17	00:01:21	68... 69... 70...
18	00:01:21	00:01:22	Talk to me, David.
19	00:01:22	00:01:26	I'm trying to determine the number of stab wounds.
20	00:01:26	00:01:28	But, frankly, there are just too many to count.
21	00:01:31	00:01:32	This is disturbing.
22	00:01:35	00:01:37	Hey, wait a minute.
23	00:01:37	00:01:40	You know something? I've been here.
24	00:01:40	00:01:45	Yeah, we had that OD out on the street a while back. Yeah, yeah, in the motel, but I mean, in this room--this exact one.
25	00:01:45	00:01:46	I-I've been here.
26	00:01:46	00:01:49	Room 114.
27	00:01:49	00:01:51	I remember the view of the neon from that window.
28	00:01:51	00:01:54	This is it. You're right.
29	00:01:54	00:01:59	We have been here before. Yeah, it was a dismemberment murder; victim was in his 20s.
30	00:01:59	00:02:01	It was about, uh, two months ago. No, I think it was more recent.
31	00:02:01	00:02:04	It was another couple, but the woman was bludgeoned...
32	00:02:04	00:02:05	in her sleep.
33	00:02:05	00:02:07	I am pretty sure it was the dismemberment.
34	00:02:07	00:02:09	I'm sorry, but-but you're both right.
35	00:02:09	00:02:13	I've been here twice before, once for the dismemberment and again for the couple.
36	00:02:13	00:02:15	And now this.
37	00:02:15	00:02:19	Anybody else getting a really bad feeling about this place?
38	00:02:19	00:02:22	Yeah... yeah, this the world's most unlucky motel room.
39	00:03:14	00:03:18	All right, that's three murder scenes all in the same spot.
40	00:03:18	00:03:20	They got to be related, don't you think?
41	00:03:20	00:03:26	Maybe there's a connection between the victims or the killer has a weird fixation of some kind.
42	00:03:26	00:03:29	I don't think I'm ready to talk about past crimes yet.
43	00:03:29	00:03:31	Have to focus on this one first.
44	00:03:31	00:03:33	Yeah, I hear you.
45	00:03:33	00:03:35	I'll take the bathroom.
46	00:04:34	00:04:36	So, how long have you been manager here?
47	00:04:36	00:04:39	Uh, since about the time I learned to walk.
48	00:04:39	00:04:41	My parents built this place, so... I grew up here.
49	00:04:41	00:04:42	Oh! Yeah.
50	00:04:42	00:04:43	All mine now.
51	00:04:43	00:04:45	Do you have any idea who might've done this?
52	00:04:45	00:04:48	Isn't that your business to figure that out?
53	00:04:48	00:04:49	I mean, I know we're not the Bellagio, but...
54	00:04:49	00:04:54	if I have to drop the rates any lower, I might as well just board the place up.
55	00:04:54	00:04:57	Yeah. So, you got about, what, uh, 20 rooms here?
56	00:04:57	00:04:59	Tell me about the people who stay in them.
57	00:04:59	00:05:03	It's like the sign says. I mean, by the night, by the week and by the month.
58	00:05:03	00:05:04	I'm gonna need a list of names.
59	00:05:04	00:05:06	Well, that could be a problem.
60	00:05:06	00:05:07	Not that I wouldn't give it, it's just...
61	00:05:07	00:05:08	I don't have it.
62	00:05:09	00:05:11	Come on, man.
63	00:05:11	00:05:13	The place is 39 bucks a night.
64	00:05:13	00:05:16	If people have cash, what do I care about their names?
65	00:05:16	00:05:20	Look, none of 'em are killers, though-- trust me.
66	00:05:20	00:05:22	How do you know that?
67	00:05:22	00:05:25	Well, there's no one here that interesting.
68	00:06:07	00:06:09	Hey, Finn!
69	00:06:09	00:06:11	Looks like the Smiths had a guest last night.
70	00:06:11	00:06:14	The towels are damp, and I found a red hair in the shower drain.
71	00:06:14	00:06:17	Hmm, that doesn't match either of our victims.
72	00:06:17	00:06:19	And there were three toothbrushes around the sink.
73	00:06:19	00:06:21	Uh, I found a receipt for one.
74	00:06:21	00:06:23	It's from the drugstore around the corner--last night.
75	00:06:23	00:06:25	So a guest they didn't plan on.
76	00:06:25	00:06:31	There's more. They also bought shampoo and a pair of scissors, which have since disappeared.
77	00:06:31	00:06:33	Could be the murder weapon.
78	00:06:33	00:06:40	So there was someone in here before the killing started. Yeah, who showered and-- I don't know-- judging from the toothbrush, might've been planning on staying the night.
79	00:06:40	00:06:41	So what went wrong?
80	00:06:52	00:06:55	I've been doing this long enough that nothing shocks me, but if a case could...
81	00:06:57	00:07:00	Just the sheer savagery involved.
82	00:07:00	00:07:02	More than a hundred stab wounds in each victim.
83	00:07:02	00:07:05	Certainly beyond what was necessary...
84	00:07:05	00:07:07	if the goal was to simply kill them.
85	00:07:07	00:07:09	Can I see that?
86	00:07:09	00:07:13	It's, uh, way beyond what we sometimes see with crimes of passion or extreme anger.
87	00:07:13	00:07:14	This was madness.
88	00:07:17	00:07:18	Their names really were Smith.
89	00:07:18	00:07:20	Richard and Ann.
90	00:07:20	00:07:25	According to family, they were in from Flagstaff for an antique toy and collectibles convention.
91	00:07:25	00:07:27	That would explain the dolls in the room.
92	00:07:27	00:07:29	Sounds like they were solid people.
93	00:07:29	00:07:33	She volunteered, ran pet therapy at an old folks home.
94	00:07:33	00:07:35	He worked with the homeless.
95	00:07:36	00:07:38	Squeaky clean.
96	00:07:38	00:07:40	Course, that wouldn't be the first time the...
97	00:07:40	00:07:43	squeaky-clean have indulged their dark side here in Vegas.
98	00:07:43	00:07:46	They could've invited somebody back to the room, spice up their life a little bit.
99	00:07:48	00:07:50	If so...
100	00:07:50	00:07:53	certainly got more than they bargained for.
101	00:07:53	00:07:59	Hey. So, I... pulled the files for the other two motel murder scenes.
102	00:07:59	00:08:01	It's weird, don't you think?
103	00:08:01	00:08:03	That a killer would fixate on one room?
104	00:08:03	00:08:04	What do you think the significance is?
105	00:08:04	00:08:05	Why does he feel the need to kill there?
106	00:08:05	00:08:09	Well, that's assuming that these are all the work of one killer.
107	00:08:09	00:08:11	It could be that there's no connection.
108	00:08:11	00:08:14	That you're looking for patterns where there are none.
109	00:08:14	00:08:18	So it's a coincidence that three totally unrelated killers chose this one room?
110	00:08:18	00:08:20	I'm just saying, we don't know yet.
111	00:08:20	00:08:24	All right, Mark Bell.
112	00:08:24	00:08:29	11 weeks ago, he stayed in Room 114 after his girlfriend kicked him out.
113	00:08:29	00:08:31	Yeah, I remember. I worked this case with Finn.
114	00:08:31	00:08:37	The maid found him tied to the bed, severe lacerations to his legs. They were nearly cut off.
115	00:08:37	00:08:38	He bled to death.
116	00:08:38	00:08:40	There was a bloody knife found on the floor.
117	00:08:40	00:08:42	Too smeared to yield any viable prints.
118	00:08:42	00:08:46	Detectives, at the time, thought the attack was related to a drug debt. (screaming)
119	00:08:46	00:08:49	They thought the dealer was sending a message.
120	00:08:50	00:08:53	Four weeks ago...
121	00:08:53	00:08:54	second attack in the room.
122	00:08:54	00:08:56	Alex and Tina Garnez.
123	00:08:56	00:08:59	Nick and I handled this one.
124	00:09:01	00:09:03	Their house had been foreclosed on.
125	00:09:03	00:09:05	They were living in their car for months.
126	00:09:05	00:09:08	Mr. Garnez finally got a job.
127	00:09:08	00:09:11	Moving to the motel was supposed to be a step up.
128	00:09:11	00:09:16	That night, he was sneaking a cigarette in the bathroom while his wife slept.
129	00:09:16	00:09:18	The killer started with his wife...
130	00:09:21	00:09:24	...clubbing her while she was sleeping.
131	00:09:24	00:09:26	Then he must've surprised Mr. Garnez in the bathroom...
132	00:09:26	00:09:28	No!
133	00:09:28	00:09:30	Overpowered him.
134	00:09:32	00:09:34	He survived.
135	00:09:34	00:09:36	He's still in the hospital recovering.
136	00:09:36	00:09:38	And then last night...
137	00:09:38	00:09:39	the Smiths.
138	00:09:41	00:09:43	(sighs) Still think we're...
139	00:09:43	00:09:46	dealing with random, unrelated events?
140	00:09:46	00:09:49	All right, Finn, I'll see you back at the lab.
141	00:10:07	00:10:10	Come on now. Open up. I saw you in there.
142	00:10:11	00:10:13	Hey.
143	00:10:13	00:10:15	I was asleep last night.
144	00:10:15	00:10:17	I was not involved. I already told the cops.
145	00:10:17	00:10:19	Oh, yeah, yeah. That's cool. I'm not, uh...
146	00:10:19	00:10:21	I'm not here to grill you. (chuckles)
147	00:10:21	00:10:24	Kind of looks like you like to call this place home.
148	00:10:24	00:10:26	I'm guessing you see everything that goes on in here.
149	00:10:26	00:10:28	You... didn't see anything weird?
150	00:10:28	00:10:30	Anybody suspicious running around here lately?
151	00:10:30	00:10:33	It's not my place to judge another man in that way.
152	00:10:33	00:10:35	Only God can judge.
153	00:10:35	00:10:39	Right... well, God would want you to help me catch a killer, wouldn't he?
154	00:10:39	00:10:41	I'm sorry.
155	00:10:41	00:10:43	Now, sir, please, please, hey, come on, now.
156	00:10:43	00:10:46	A couple was violently murdered last night.
157	00:10:46	00:10:49	A woman a few weeks ago. A young man before that.
158	00:10:49	00:10:52	All in the same room, all innocent victims.
159	00:10:52	00:10:55	Innocent? There's no one on this planet who's innocent.
160	00:10:57	00:10:58	We're all sinners.
161	00:10:58	00:11:02	Yeah, yeah, well, that-that doesn't really help me do my job.
162	00:11:02	00:11:04	They were called to God.
163	00:11:04	00:11:05	That's God's plan.
164	00:11:07	00:11:08	Your job is done.
165	00:11:08	00:11:10	Yeah, I just...
166	00:11:13	00:11:19	Might be my biggest regret about this job-- I know way too much about hotel bedspreads.
167	00:11:19	00:11:24	And hotel carpets. Don't go barefoot. So, we have three different bedspreads from our...
168	00:11:24	00:11:25	three different crime scenes.
169	00:11:25	00:11:27	I ran the DNA.
170	00:11:27	00:11:33	The bedspread on the left is from the very first murder scene. I'm guessing it lived in that room for who knows how long.
171	00:11:33	00:11:37	Long enough that I was able to identify 26 individual DNA profiles.
172	00:11:37	00:11:42	Whoa. Yeah. The replacement bedspread there was only in the room for seven weeks. So fewer contributions.
173	00:11:42	00:11:44	16 of them.
174	00:11:44	00:11:47	And the third bedspread, from last night's crime scene.
175	00:11:47	00:11:49	Yielded only nine contributors.
176	00:11:49	00:11:55	One of them, a male, is common to all three bedspreads.
177	00:11:55	00:11:59	One person, the same person was in the room before each of the murders?
178	00:12:00	00:12:02	Have you run the samples through CODIS?
179	00:12:02	00:12:03	It's running right now.
180	00:12:05	00:12:08	Here we go.
181	00:12:08	00:12:12	Randall Wicks, 22. He must have just been added to the system.
182	00:12:12	00:12:15	There's why-- sexual battery charge two weeks ago.
183	00:12:15	00:12:16	Look where he was arrested.
184	00:12:18	00:12:20	That same motel. The same room!
185	00:12:20	00:12:24	I'll call Brass, get out a broadcast.
186	00:12:30	00:12:32	Oh, how the mighty have fallen, huh, Randall?
187	00:12:32	00:12:36	You used to be the featured dancer in the Tangiers All Male Review.
188	00:12:36	00:12:38	How'd you let that gig slip away?
189	00:12:38	00:12:39	I don't know.
190	00:12:39	00:12:41	I got bored, so I quit.
191	00:12:41	00:12:44	Well, or maybe you found something more interesting to do, huh?
192	00:12:47	00:12:52	Three separate murders in the same room at the Sky View Motel.
193	00:12:52	00:12:56	Your DNA was found in the room after each of the crimes.
194	00:12:56	00:13:00	What? Wait a minute-- Sky View Motel?
195	00:13:00	00:13:02	Was that in room 114?
196	00:13:02	00:13:04	I use that room, frequently.
197	00:13:04	00:13:05	For business.
198	00:13:05	00:13:08	So... you're a prostitute?
199	00:13:08	00:13:14	Dude, I'm a stud, letting frustrated housewives get a taste of something they wouldn't even get close to otherwise.
200	00:13:14	00:13:17	Okay, stud, what about the housewife you beat up in room 114?
201	00:13:17	00:13:19	The sexual battery charge.
202	00:13:19	00:13:21	Or was that just part of the pony ride experience?
203	00:13:21	00:13:23	That was self-defense.
204	00:13:23	00:13:24	I'm serious.
205	00:13:24	00:13:27	I was in fear for my life.
206	00:13:27	00:13:28	Okay...
207	00:13:28	00:13:30	I meet this woman there, right?
208	00:13:30	00:13:33	Totally normal at first.
209	00:13:33	00:13:35	Then we start getting into it, and...
210	00:13:35	00:13:37	I don't know, she goes all crazy.
211	00:13:37	00:13:40	Starts hallucinating or something, screaming at the walls.
212	00:13:40	00:13:43	And why?
213	00:13:43	00:13:45	What would make her do that?
214	00:13:45	00:13:47	Well, I ain't a doctor or nothing, but...
215	00:13:47	00:13:49	must be the sex just blew her mind.
216	00:13:50	00:13:52	Yeah, that must have been it.
217	00:13:52	00:13:57	Well... aside from being a complete tool, what do you think?
218	00:13:57	00:14:04	Well, he still could be our killer. Well, the problem is, all we have is DNA evidence, and we can't disprove his story of how it got in that room.
219	00:14:04	00:14:08	Well, we do have an eyewitness who could possibly I.D. Randall.
220	00:14:08	00:14:13	Alex Garnez, the husband who survived his wife being bludgeoned four weeks ago. He has massive head injuries.
221	00:14:13	00:14:16	He's still in the hospital-- we don't even know what condition he's in.
222	00:14:16	00:14:17	Well, I talked to his doctor.
223	00:14:17	00:14:20	She said he's struggling psychologically.
224	00:14:20	00:14:24	They have him on suicide watch after one failed attempt, but... physically...
225	00:14:24	00:14:27	she said he's strong enough to talk to us.
226	00:14:37	00:14:38	Mr. Garnez.
227	00:14:38	00:14:40	Um...
228	00:14:40	00:14:45	I'm CSI Brody, and this is CSI Sanders.
229	00:14:45	00:14:51	I'm sorry, but we need to talk to you about the night that you and your wife were attacked.
230	00:14:53	00:14:55	How much do you remember?
231	00:15:00	00:15:01	I don't know.
232	00:15:01	00:15:04	I... I...
233	00:15:04	00:15:10	I remember her just lying there, just lying there.
234	00:15:10	00:15:13	And all the... blood around her...
235	00:15:17	00:15:20	We were high school sweethearts.
236	00:15:23	00:15:26	Did you see the person who hurt you and your wife?
237	00:15:29	00:15:30	Do you remember his face?
238	00:15:35	00:15:37	I can see him...
239	00:15:37	00:15:41	standing over her, hitting her over...
240	00:15:41	00:15:44	and over...
241	00:15:44	00:15:46	and...
242	00:15:46	00:15:48	and I'm powerless.
243	00:15:48	00:15:51	I... I can't stop him.
244	00:15:51	00:15:53	Like there's a wall between us. I...
245	00:15:53	00:15:57	Yet I can still hear the sickening sound of...
246	00:15:57	00:15:59	blow...
247	00:15:59	00:16:01	after blow.
248	00:16:01	00:16:03	Mr. Garnez...
249	00:16:03	00:16:07	we want to... we want to show you some photographs of some faces.
250	00:16:07	00:16:13	We need you to tell us if any one of these men looks like the man that we've been talking about, okay?
251	00:16:18	00:16:19	He's not there.
252	00:16:19	00:16:21	Are you sure?
253	00:16:23	00:16:24	None of these...
254	00:16:24	00:16:28	is the man that killed my Tina.
255	00:16:30	00:16:33	Hodges, you texted me 911?
256	00:16:33	00:16:34	I did.
257	00:16:34	00:16:36	What is the 911?
258	00:16:36	00:16:39	Sorry. Your suspect.
259	00:16:39	00:16:41	He ran from the motel room barefoot, correct?
260	00:16:41	00:16:42	Mm-hmm.
261	00:16:42	00:16:43	Yet he left no shoes behind.
262	00:16:43	00:16:45	He could have been carrying his shoes.
263	00:16:45	00:16:47	He was in too much of a hurry to put them on.
264	00:16:47	00:16:51	Mm, maybe. But there was a bottle of shampoo that Nick found in the bathroom.
265	00:16:51	00:16:56	It contained one percent permethrin, formulated to combat head lice.
266	00:16:56	00:16:57	Now, I've checked with Doc.
267	00:16:57	00:17:00	Neither of the Smiths were head lice sufferers.
268	00:17:00	00:17:01	So the shampoo was for the guest.
269	00:17:01	00:17:04	Yes. Presumably the killer.
270	00:17:04	00:17:06	Nick found residue on the wall of the shower.
271	00:17:06	00:17:09	I've tested it; it contained five percent permethrin.
272	00:17:09	00:17:11	Permethrin, for the head lice. No.
273	00:17:11	00:17:13	This is five percent, in a body cream.
274	00:17:13	00:17:16	It's prescription strength, used to treat scabies.
275	00:17:16	00:17:19	I don't want to seem insensitive, but...
276	00:17:19	00:17:24	shoeless, head lice, and scabies--that all sounds like homeless to me.
277	00:17:24	00:17:28	Richard Smith worked with the homeless back in Flagstaff.
278	00:17:28	00:17:32	He could have been doing some sort of outreach, wanted to help somebody, brought them in off the street.
279	00:17:32	00:17:34	I've already called around.
280	00:17:34	00:17:40	There's a local shelter called Street Saviors who had a scabies outbreak last week, where they distributed this very same prescription cream.
281	00:17:40	00:17:43	Way to bury the lead, Hodges. That's part of my charm.
282	00:17:43	00:17:45	It's all in the telling.
283	00:17:45	00:17:46	The regular.
284	00:17:46	00:17:48	Yeah. Fruity.
285	00:17:48	00:17:50	Okay, thanks so much.
286	00:17:53	00:17:56	Hey. So I talked to a couple Hey.
287	00:17:56	00:17:57	of the outreach workers.
288	00:17:57	00:18:00	They saw a guy earlier, a guy named Rudy.
289	00:18:00	00:18:02	He's a regular here.
290	00:18:02	00:18:05	He was barefoot, had bloodstained clothes.
291	00:18:05	00:18:06	Sounds like our boy.
292	00:18:06	00:18:09	Yeah. According to the locals, he likes to hang out here, under the bridge.
293	00:18:16	00:18:17	Anybody seen Rudy?
294	00:18:17	00:18:19	Huh?
295	00:18:20	00:18:22	You seen Rudy?
296	00:18:22	00:18:24	You know who Rudy is?
297	00:18:25	00:18:27	Hey, where does Rudy stay?
298	00:18:32	00:18:34	Hey, old-timer. Hey, man.
299	00:18:34	00:18:37	You seen Rudy anywhere?
300	00:18:52	00:18:54	Rudy! (gasping)
301	00:18:54	00:18:56	What's wrong?
302	00:18:57	00:18:59	What have you been doing, man?
303	00:19:00	00:19:02	(panting) Huh?
304	00:19:03	00:19:07	Rudy, you're gonna have to come with us.
305	00:19:07	00:19:12	Rudy, it says here in my files that you spent some time in the state hospital.
306	00:19:12	00:19:13	Had a few psych holds?
307	00:19:13	00:19:16	Yeah, I have some problems.
308	00:19:16	00:19:18	What did the doctors diagnose you with?
309	00:19:19	00:19:26	Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, Well, that's okay.
310	00:19:26	00:19:28	We get the idea.
311	00:19:28	00:19:31	Do you recognize these two? Richard and Ann?
312	00:19:31	00:19:33	They're angels.
313	00:19:33	00:19:36	What do you mean? They rescued me.
314	00:19:36	00:19:47	How? I was on the street, out front of a drugstore on Cramer. Oh, that's right near the Sky View Motel. I go there sometimes to ask for change, you know, and-and I...
315	00:19:47	00:19:50	These guys, they jumped me and-and...
316	00:19:50	00:19:55	and they beat me, and they took my change and they took my shoes.
317	00:19:55	00:20:00	And-and it probably would have been worse, except that Richard and Ann came along out of nowhere and...
318	00:20:00	00:20:03	and chased them away.
319	00:20:03	00:20:04	Rudy, what happened next?
320	00:20:07	00:20:10	I told you, they're angels.
321	00:20:10	00:20:12	They-they-they...
322	00:20:12	00:20:21	they asked me if I wanted to stay in their room with them, and they got me a toothbrush and stuff, and they let me get a shower and get all cleaned up.
323	00:20:21	00:20:22	Did something happen after the shower?
324	00:20:24	00:20:26	Something happened, didn't it?
325	00:20:28	00:20:29	I don't know.
326	00:20:29	00:20:31	I don't remember.
327	00:20:31	00:20:33	Come on, Rudy, think.
328	00:20:33	00:20:36	Think real hard. (shuddering breath)
329	00:20:36	00:20:37	No! No!
330	00:20:43	00:20:44	There were these dolls...
331	00:20:44	00:20:50	a-and there were a whole bunch of them, and they started talking to me and they were looking at me.
332	00:20:53	00:20:55	What were they saying, Rudy? What did they say?
333	00:20:55	00:20:59	Did the dolls tell you to do this?
334	00:21:01	00:21:02	I...
335	00:21:05	00:21:08	I did that, didn't I? I did that with the scissors.
336	00:21:08	00:21:09	I hurt them.
337	00:21:13	00:21:15	What about these people?
338	00:21:19	00:21:20	Did you hurt them, too?
339	00:21:23	00:21:25	I don't know.
340	00:21:25	00:21:30	You know, sometimes I think we forget what delicate, complex machines we are.
341	00:21:30	00:21:38	You know, all it takes are a few short-circuiting synapses, or a breakdown in myelination, and everything gets thrown out of whack.
342	00:21:38	00:21:41	Jules, you just captured a killer.
343	00:21:41	00:21:44	I know. Then why do I feel so bad?
344	00:21:44	00:21:48	Because he seems like a nice guy who got dealt a lousy hand in life.
345	00:21:49	00:21:53	So we have him for killing the Smiths, right?
346	00:21:53	00:21:54	What about the other two attacks?
347	00:21:54	00:21:57	Well, I could go over all the evidence and make a case.
348	00:21:57	00:21:59	He's obviously our prime suspect.
349	00:21:59	00:22:04	He frequented the area, and he's obviously unstable.
350	00:22:07	00:22:08	Good work.
351	00:22:08	00:22:10	You put some long hours in on this.
352	00:22:10	00:22:14	Why-why don't you go home, get yourself some rest.
353	00:22:33	00:22:35	Take it, take it easy!
354	00:22:35	00:22:37	One plus one is two. One for me and one for you.
355	00:22:37	00:22:40	Two plus two is four. (panting)
356	00:22:40	00:22:43	That's a couple more. Three plus three is six.
357	00:22:43	00:22:44	Straight and crooked sticks!
358	00:22:44	00:22:45	Get away!
359	00:22:50	00:22:51	One plus one is two.
360	00:22:51	00:22:52	One for me and one for you.
361	00:22:52	00:22:54	Two plus two is four, and that's a couple more.
362	00:22:55	00:22:57	One plus one is two. One for me and one for you.
363	00:22:57	00:22:59	Two plus two is four. That's a couple more.
364	00:22:59	00:23:00	Three plus three is six. Ma'am.
365	00:23:00	00:23:01	Straight and crooked sticks.
366	00:23:01	00:23:03	You need to drop that bottle, do you hear me?
367	00:23:04	00:23:05	Four plus four is eight. Seagulls on the gate!
368	00:23:05	00:23:07	Five plus five is ten. Hey!
369	00:23:07	00:23:09	Do you hear what I'm saying?!
370	00:23:09	00:23:12	Drop the bottle!
371	00:23:12	00:23:13	Ricky doesn't follow directions!
372	00:23:13	00:23:17	He never follows directions!
373	00:23:23	00:23:24	Thanks, man.
374	00:23:24	00:23:26	Seriously, thanks.
375	00:23:26	00:23:28	Thanks. All right.
376	00:23:29	00:23:31	Hey!
377	00:23:31	00:23:32	Was she staying here? In the motel?
378	00:23:32	00:23:34	Uh, yeah, just since tonight.
379	00:23:35	00:23:36	What room?
380	00:23:48	00:23:50	It's happened again.
381	00:24:20	00:24:22	How the hell can this be?
382	00:24:22	00:24:24	I thought we had our killer.
383	00:24:24	00:24:26	Did we mess up, Jules?
384	00:24:26	00:24:28	Did we make a mistake with our-our homeless guy?
385	00:24:28	00:24:32	No, Rudy's guilty, maybe not of all three, but he definitely killed the Smiths.
386	00:24:32	00:24:33	Then how do we explain this?
387	00:24:33	00:24:35	I don't know.
388	00:24:35	00:24:37	It has to be... unrelated.
389	00:24:37	00:24:38	Unrelated?
390	00:24:38	00:24:42	Four murders in the same room over a three-month period.
391	00:24:42	00:24:43	That's got to be connected, don't you think?
392	00:24:46	00:24:51	All right, I'm sorry. Look, all right, who are our players tonight?
393	00:24:51	00:24:53	Who are we talking about here?
394	00:24:53	00:24:57	Suspect is a woman, 28-year-old high school math teacher.
395	00:24:57	00:25:00	Victim was one of her students.
396	00:25:00	00:25:03	Together in a sleazy, $39-a-night motel room.
397	00:25:03	00:25:08	With lingerie, condoms, sex toys and alcohol.
398	00:25:08	00:25:10	Wonder what was going on here, right?
399	00:25:10	00:25:14	Yeah, according to the high school Web site, she was just named Teacher of the Year.
400	00:25:14	00:25:16	I'll bet she was.
401	00:25:16	00:25:17	Hey. Hey.
402	00:25:17	00:25:22	So, this may sound crazy, but I'm thinking that this isn't what it looks like.
403	00:25:22	00:25:25	I don't believe that the teacher was sleeping with her student.
404	00:25:25	00:25:26	Yeah, you're right, that sounds crazy.
405	00:25:26	00:25:30	Well, listen to this voice mail I found on her phone.
406	00:25:30	00:25:31	Ms. Stone, it's Matthew.
407	00:25:31	00:25:40	I don't know what to do, but my parents have been drinking and fighting, and I can't go home; I'm at a motel.
408	00:25:40	00:25:41	But I'm scared.
409	00:25:41	00:25:43	I don't know who else to call.
410	00:25:43	00:25:46	I'm sorry, but you have to help, please.
411	00:25:46	00:25:52	Ms. Stone, we are trying to make sense out of what happened in that room.
412	00:25:52	00:25:54	But we need your help to do that.
413	00:25:54	00:26:01	Boy, Matthew must have told you a really sad story to lure you to that motel room.
414	00:26:01	00:26:10	Now, obviously, from the items he brought along, he had ideas of getting Now, there were a lot of empty liquor bottles in the room.
415	00:26:10	00:26:11	Was the young man drunk?
416	00:26:11	00:26:14	There wasn't any drinking.
417	00:26:14	00:26:17	First thing I did was dump all the alcohol down the sink.
418	00:26:17	00:26:21	I wanted it clear to Matthew that nothing was going to happen.
419	00:26:21	00:26:22	Did he get upset?
420	00:26:22	00:26:23	Is that when he threatened you?
421	00:26:23	00:26:25	He would never.
422	00:26:25	00:26:29	Matthew's a... Matthew's a great kid.
423	00:26:29	00:26:31	He just had a harmless crush, that's all.
424	00:26:31	00:26:33	He would never hurt me.
425	00:26:33	00:26:34	Then why did you kill him?
426	00:26:39	00:26:42	It wasn't me.
427	00:26:42	00:26:44	Really? Wasn't you?
428	00:26:44	00:26:46	Ms. Stone, look, look at this.
429	00:26:50	00:26:52	That's not me.
430	00:26:52	00:26:55	I mean, it's me, it's my body, but I...
431	00:26:58	00:26:59	I had no control.
432	00:26:59	00:27:01	It was like there was something inside me.
433	00:27:01	00:27:02	I was...
434	00:27:05	00:27:07	...possessed.
435	00:27:07	00:27:08	You were what?
436	00:27:08	00:27:10	I was...
437	00:27:13	00:27:15	I don't know. Part of me really wants to believe her.
438	00:27:15	00:27:20	I mean, the woman ranting and screaming on that video from last night was nothing like the woman I met today.
439	00:27:20	00:27:22	They were two totally different people.
440	00:27:22	00:27:25	So, her behavior last night was completely out of character.
441	00:27:25	00:27:27	Mm-hmm! Did the hospital do a tox screen?
442	00:27:27	00:27:29	Yeah, it was clean. Not even alcohol.
443	00:27:29	00:27:33	Then it's got to be the room.
444	00:27:33	00:27:35	The room made her do it.
445	00:27:35	00:27:38	What, like, The Shining? Hmm?
446	00:27:38	00:27:39	The Overlook Hotel?
447	00:27:39	00:27:43	It's the one thing connecting all of the murders.
448	00:27:43	00:27:45	Right now, it's the only thing.
449	00:27:45	00:27:51	Okay, so, let's have Hodges and Henry drag their equipment out there and test the room, see what they have to say.
450	00:27:57	00:27:59	Hmm.
451	00:28:02	00:28:08	I've got some elevated VOCs in the air conditioner, but nothing that would explain any of the bizarre behavior.
452	00:28:08	00:28:10	What about you?
453	00:28:10	00:28:12	You got anything yet?
454	00:28:12	00:28:14	Could I have five minutes to look first?
455	00:28:18	00:28:21	Oh, and I'm very much enjoying the dirty bathroom.
456	00:28:21	00:28:22	Thank you for that.
457	00:28:28	00:28:30	Mm! Mm...
458	00:28:30	00:28:34	Great. Now I can smell like a fruit bowl for the rest of the day.
459	00:29:13	00:29:17	It looks like they've got mold inside the walls of the closet.
460	00:29:17	00:29:19	I'm going to have to get a sample.
461	00:29:19	00:29:21	Do you have the pry bar in there?
462	00:29:21	00:29:23	Hey, I have to open some drywall.
463	00:29:23	00:29:25	Do you have the pry bar in your kit?
464	00:29:25	00:29:27	Hodges!
465	00:29:29	00:29:31	Seriously?
466	00:29:33	00:29:35	Hodges, what are you doing?
467	00:29:35	00:29:36	I was calling you.
468	00:29:43	00:29:44	What are you looking at?
469	00:29:49	00:29:52	What, what's going on with you?
470	00:29:52	00:29:54	I know who you are.
471	00:29:54	00:29:56	Okay, look, w-why don't you have a seat on the toilet...
472	00:29:58	00:30:00	I'm gonna help you out, come here.
473	00:30:00	00:30:03	I can see what you are!
474	00:30:05	00:30:08	Hodges, let go of me! That hurts!
475	00:30:13	00:30:15	No... Hodges!
476	00:30:15	00:30:16	No, no...!
477	00:30:20	00:30:22	This is Henry Andrews.
478	00:30:22	00:30:26	I'm at the Sky View Motel, room 114, and I have an emergency.
479	00:30:26	00:30:28	I need police and EMS immediately.
480	00:30:34	00:30:35	Excuse me... Hey! Henry!
481	00:30:37	00:30:38	Henry?
482	00:30:38	00:30:39	Hey, man, you all right?
483	00:30:39	00:30:40	What's going on out here?
484	00:30:40	00:30:41	I don't know exactly.
485	00:30:41	00:30:43	He just flipped out.
486	00:30:43	00:30:46	Nick, I honestly think he would have killed me.
487	00:30:46	00:30:48	Hodges? Yeah, but it wasn't Hodges.
488	00:30:48	00:30:53	I mean, if you would've seen the look in his eyes, something must have happened to him in there, something that triggered this.
489	00:30:53	00:30:55	What'd he say to you? Nothing.
490	00:30:55	00:30:56	Everything that came out of him was unintelligible.
491	00:30:56	00:31:01	It was grunts and growls. Hey, so paramedics hit him with a sedative.
492	00:31:01	00:31:04	Once they get him to the hospital, maybe we'll figure out what's going on.
493	00:31:04	00:31:07	Wait, wait, before he goes, I-I need a-a... a swab.
494	00:31:07	00:31:08	Check your vest.
495	00:31:08	00:31:09	Hold up.
496	00:31:09	00:31:12	Hey, buddy, I just need to get some saliva.
497	00:31:12	00:31:14	Can you help me out? (mumbling)
498	00:31:14	00:31:15	Can you open up?
499	00:31:15	00:31:16	Come on, just open up.
500	00:31:16	00:31:19	There you go, help me out.
501	00:31:19	00:31:20	There you go.
502	00:31:20	00:31:22	Good.
503	00:31:22	00:31:23	Yeah, get him out of here.
504	00:31:28	00:31:30	Vitals are good...
505	00:31:32	00:31:33	Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it.
506	00:31:33	00:31:35	You're welcome.
507	00:31:35	00:31:36	What did he say? How's he doing?
508	00:31:36	00:31:38	He's gonna be okay.
509	00:31:38	00:31:40	I mean, his vitals are all in the normal range.
510	00:31:40	00:31:43	He doesn't seem to be in any physical distress.
511	00:31:43	00:31:46	Well, obviously there is something going on in that motel room.
512	00:31:46	00:31:50	Now we need to add Hodges to the list of people that went nuts in there, right?
513	00:31:50	00:31:54	Homeless guy, the teacher-- Makes me wonder about our first victim, Mark Bell.
514	00:31:54	00:31:58	Who's to say he didn't go crazy, too, and stab himself in his legs.
515	00:31:58	00:32:03	If all of this is true, what's it say about the man who lost his wife?
516	00:32:03	00:32:08	Hey, guys, you are not gonna believe this, but Hodges was drugged.
517	00:32:08	00:32:09	What are you talking about?
518	00:32:09	00:32:12	LSD-- I did an ELISA test on his saliva.
519	00:32:12	00:32:16	Somehow, he must've been dosed while we were in the room working.
520	00:32:16	00:32:20	Wait a minute, didn't the hospital do a tox screen on the teacher and on Rudy, and it came back negative?
521	00:32:20	00:32:26	The standard tox panel doesn't test for LSD, so they were probably dosed, too-- we just had no way to know it.
522	00:32:26	00:32:27	But wh-why the violence?
523	00:32:27	00:32:32	The molecules I found were highly adulterated, and cut with a cyclidine similar to PCP.
524	00:32:32	00:32:34	Probably came out of somebody's kitchen sink.
525	00:32:34	00:32:36	Okay.
526	00:32:36	00:32:37	Now we know what.
527	00:32:38	00:32:41	Let's go find out how.
528	00:32:43	00:32:48	So, according to Henry, this lysergic acid glows blue.
529	00:32:48	00:32:49	And the stuff's potent.
530	00:32:49	00:32:51	We may not be looking for much.
531	00:32:51	00:32:53	Wait a minute-- got something over here.
532	00:32:55	00:32:57	These are tiny drops.
533	00:32:57	00:33:00	It looks like they might've been aerosolized.
534	00:33:04	00:33:08	Check it out-- covered in blue.
535	00:33:08	00:33:10	This is our source right here.
536	00:33:10	00:33:17	If Hodges got sprayed by that, it would only have to land on his lips or in his eye, and it would be instantly absorbed.
537	00:33:25	00:33:26	Here, let me bag it.
538	00:33:29	00:33:31	Hold on here.
539	00:33:31	00:33:34	I don't think the LSD was coming from that cartridge.
540	00:33:36	00:33:37	There's a hose in here.
541	00:33:40	00:33:44	Yeah, and it's coming through the wall from the next room.
542	00:33:50	00:33:53	Hey, Oscar, can we use your bathroom for a second?
543	00:33:53	00:33:54	Hey! You can't come in here like this!
544	00:33:54	00:33:56	Sure we can. Check it out, Greg.
545	00:33:56	00:33:59	It's called probable cause, Oscar.
546	00:34:00	00:34:01	What do you got?
547	00:34:07	00:34:08	Found the source.
548	00:34:10	00:34:15	Oscar, I remember standing right there and listening to you preach to me about God's will.
549	00:34:15	00:34:16	Is this what you meant? Huh?
550	00:34:16	00:34:17	Killing six people?
551	00:34:17	00:34:19	I didn't kill anyone.
552	00:34:19	00:34:21	You've been spraying LSD all over the bathroom next door.
553	00:34:21	00:34:23	You're responsible!
554	00:34:23	00:34:24	I don't know what you're talking about.
555	00:34:24	00:34:26	God sees the truth.
556	00:34:26	00:34:27	Yes, sir! God knows my heart!
557	00:34:27	00:34:28	You know what? I'm tired of hearing that.
558	00:34:28	00:34:31	Sit down, relax. I'm gonna get you a ride.
559	00:34:31	00:34:33	Nick, take a look at this.
560	00:34:38	00:34:40	That's an odd place for a TV.
561	00:34:44	00:34:47	That's the room next door-- room 114.
562	00:34:47	00:34:51	So not only have you been dosing the people next door, you've been recording it, too?
563	00:34:51	00:34:54	Hey, Nick, I don't see any recording device.
564	00:34:56	00:35:00	But there's this transmitter set up to send a signal someplace else.
565	00:35:00	00:35:02	So what's with all the video stuff? I don't know.
566	00:35:02	00:35:04	I just know I'm not supposed to touch it.
567	00:35:04	00:35:05	Yeah? Who told you that?
568	00:35:05	00:35:07	Huh?
569	00:35:09	00:35:11	Trent, the manager.
570	00:35:11	00:35:13	He said if I did, he'd kick me out.
571	00:35:17	00:35:20	Trent Raeger, got a warrant. See you downtown.
572	00:35:36	00:35:40	Hey, Nick, you gotta come and see this.
573	00:35:40	00:35:44	Our peeper has been looking at all the rooms, not just room 114.
574	00:35:52	00:35:55	Yeah, he's been spending some quality time in here.
575	00:36:04	00:36:08	Hmm. These are all souvenirs...
576	00:36:09	00:36:11	...from his favorite guests.
577	00:36:16	00:36:21	You've been peeping on room 114 for a long time, haven't you, Trent?
578	00:36:21	00:36:26	At what point did you decide that it wasn't enough to just be a voyeur?
579	00:36:26	00:36:28	I mean, when did you decide that you needed to kill people?
580	00:36:28	00:36:31	It isn't like that.
581	00:36:31	00:36:33	Okay, then tell me what it's like.
582	00:36:33	00:36:35	Well, it's just about...
583	00:36:37	00:36:39	...watching, you know?
584	00:36:39	00:36:43	All the people coming through the motel.
585	00:36:43	00:36:49	When I was a kid, we'd get families on vacation, and I was curious because we never took vacations.
586	00:36:49	00:36:52	We never left.
587	00:36:52	00:36:54	So...
588	00:36:54	00:36:57	I had these special places where I could look through the walls...
589	00:36:57	00:36:59	watch them.
590	00:36:59	00:37:01	Special places.
591	00:37:02	00:37:05	Then the video age came and you upgraded your little hobby, right?
592	00:37:07	00:37:09	That was pretty cool, too.
593	00:37:09	00:37:12	I mean, especially when the motel kind of went downhill, you know?
594	00:37:12	00:37:15	That brought all kinds of crazy stuff.
595	00:37:15	00:37:20	The crack whores, drunk dudes, beating their wives, they...
596	00:37:20	00:37:23	That is a show, believe me.
597	00:37:23	00:37:28	But even that got a little old and dull, so you spiced it up by dosing people with drugs?
598	00:37:28	00:37:34	A few months ago, I saw this guy out on Third, tripping on acid.
599	00:37:34	00:37:41	He was, like, out of his mind, and it was just so...
600	00:37:41	00:37:43	so weird.
601	00:37:44	00:37:48	And that is when I came up with that rig for the bathroom.
602	00:37:49	00:37:53	You have to admit... it is pretty clever.
603	00:37:53	00:37:55	Clever.
604	00:38:04	00:38:09	Five people are dead, one is in the hospital.
605	00:38:09	00:38:13	Hey, I just put the gas in the car... okay?
606	00:38:13	00:38:15	They're the ones that crashed it.
607	00:38:18	00:38:20	Come on...
608	00:38:20	00:38:23	you've got my tapes; you've seen 'em.
609	00:38:23	00:38:27	That first dude, hacking his legs off.
610	00:38:27	00:38:30	Or that teacher... oh, and the homeless guy.
611	00:38:30	00:38:35	I mean, the dude is already a total mess, and then the lady has all those dolls!
612	00:38:35	00:38:37	I mean, that was a gift.
613	00:38:37	00:38:40	Or the poor Mexican guy...
614	00:38:40	00:38:42	killing his wife.
615	00:38:44	00:38:46	Honestly, I didn't see that coming.
616	00:38:46	00:38:47	I mean, that...
617	00:38:47	00:38:48	that...
618	00:38:50	00:38:52	...that was awesome.
619	00:38:54	00:38:56	Awesome.
620	00:38:58	00:39:00	What are you looking at me like that for?
621	00:39:00	00:39:05	Come on, people go online every day to look at stuff that's just like that.
622	00:39:05	00:39:06	But you manipulated this.
623	00:39:06	00:39:09	You made this happen.
624	00:39:09	00:39:14	You made these people, these innocent people, do these things.
625	00:39:16	00:39:17	So what?
626	00:39:19	00:39:21	What's the difference?
627	00:39:24	00:39:27	Well, you'll have 25 years to life to figure that out.
628	00:39:27	00:39:33	And the weird thing is you're gonna be in a little room where people watching you 24/7.
629	00:39:39	00:39:41	Hey.
630	00:39:44	00:39:46	I, uh, heard they're going to be discharging you soon.
631	00:39:46	00:39:48	Yeah.
632	00:39:48	00:39:50	I guess I've healed as much as I'm going to.
633	00:39:50	00:39:57	Well, I... I came 'cause I wanted you to know that we arrested the man responsible for what happened to you and to your wife.
634	00:39:57	00:40:00	He didn't physically do the killings, but he is responsible.
635	00:40:00	00:40:03	Well, I-I... I'm sorry, I'm a little confused here.
636	00:40:03	00:40:05	The man we arrested...
637	00:40:05	00:40:10	lived in the motel, and he drugged several of his guests.
638	00:40:11	00:40:19	That night, when your wife went to sleep, you went into the bathroom and you snuck a cigarette.
639	00:40:19	00:40:31	While you were in the bathroom, you were dosed with a very potent psychedelic drug, and it caused a violent change in your personality and your behavior.
640	00:40:31	00:40:34	That face... that you saw...
641	00:40:34	00:40:36	the man who was hitting your wife...
642	00:40:51	00:41:00	Uh... in a little while, there's going to be some police officers coming here, and you're going to need to go with them, okay?
643	00:41:00	00:41:03	I'm sorry.
644	00:41:23	00:41:28	I want to apologize for anything I may have said while I wasn't myself.
645	00:41:28	00:41:32	It wasn't your words so much as your actions, really.
646	00:41:39	00:41:42	And, obviously...
647	00:41:42	00:41:44	I apologize for those, too.
648	00:41:47	00:41:50	Apology accepted?
649	00:41:56	00:41:57	Yes.
650	00:42:00	00:42:01	Apology accepted.
651	00:42:01	00:42:03	Good.
652	00:42:03	00:42:05	Then you won't be trying to get back at me in some way?
653	00:42:05	00:42:08	No, of course not.
654	00:42:10	00:42:12	But I wouldn't drink that coffee, if I were you.
