0,00:00:13,00:00:14,"Good afternoon, Mr. McGrath."
1,00:00:14,00:00:15,How’s the golf?
2,00:00:20,00:00:22,Hi.
3,00:00:22,00:00:23,You look lost.
4,00:00:23,00:00:28,"Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the real estate office is at the end of the hall."
5,00:00:28,00:00:30,Okay? Bye.
6,00:00:30,00:00:32,"Ooh, are those for me?"
7,00:00:32,00:00:33,"Hi, Dominic, sign here."
8,00:00:33,00:00:34,Okay.
9,00:00:34,00:00:37,"I tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday."
10,00:00:37,00:00:39,"I know, Elvis."
11,00:00:39,00:00:40,Okay.
12,00:00:40,00:00:41,"See you. Okay, bye-bye."
13,00:00:41,00:00:42,( groans )
14,00:00:42,00:00:44,"Domino, it’s your turn to pick up dinner."
15,00:00:44,00:00:45,"Okay, Jake-o."
16,00:00:45,00:00:47,"Listen, uh, this goes to Cooley Real Estate."
17,00:00:47,00:00:48,"That’s on two, all right?"
18,00:00:48,00:00:51,And the Fed Ex is running a little bit late on the pick-up.
19,00:00:51,00:00:52,I’ll be back in...
20,00:00:52,00:00:54,"hmm, about ten minutes, all right?"
21,00:00:54,00:00:55,"You got it. All right, buddy."
22,00:01:02,00:01:03,( ticking )
23,00:01:15,00:01:17,( ticking continues )
24,00:01:28,00:01:29,( yells )
25,00:01:34,00:01:38,"Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene."
26,00:01:38,00:01:39,That’s what they do.
27,00:01:39,00:01:42,Put wet stuff on the red stuff.
28,00:01:42,00:01:45,"We’re all clear to go in, but here’s what we’ve got."
29,00:01:45,00:01:46,Couple of head wounds.
30,00:01:46,00:01:48,Elderly guy had his arm torn off.
31,00:01:48,00:01:50,"The only fatality so far is Jake Richards, a security guard."
32,00:01:50,00:01:53,Body’s still inside.
33,00:02:02,00:02:03,BRASS: How big you think this bomb was?
34,00:02:03,00:02:05,WILLOWS: It’s not the size of the bomb.
35,00:02:05,00:02:08,It’s the overpressure in the air around it.
36,00:02:25,00:02:27,The Van Gogh effect.
37,00:02:28,00:02:29,In stereo.
38,00:02:29,00:02:31,Both ears gone.
39,00:02:31,00:02:33,A perfectly symmetrical amputation.
40,00:02:33,00:02:36,Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.
41,00:02:36,00:02:41,So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.
42,00:02:43,00:02:45,Smell the sulfur?
43,00:02:45,00:02:47,Uh-huh.
44,00:02:50,00:02:51,"Got your lighter, Jim?"
45,00:02:51,00:02:53,Sure.
46,00:02:58,00:02:59,Light this.
47,00:03:02,00:03:04,Gunpowder.
48,00:03:04,00:03:06,"GRISSOM: Well, we know the propellant."
49,00:03:06,00:03:09,So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?
50,00:03:09,00:03:10,I’d love to.
51,00:03:12,00:03:14,Seat of the bomb is here.
52,00:03:14,00:03:17,Victim was thrown...
53,00:03:17,00:03:19,three meters.
54,00:03:19,00:03:24,"His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant."
55,00:03:24,00:03:25,"6,000-7,000 feet per second."
56,00:03:25,00:03:28,Who? Why?
57,00:03:28,00:03:31,Will he do it again?
58,00:03:31,00:03:33,Time will tell.
59,00:04:14,00:04:20,The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use.
60,00:04:20,00:04:24,Our murder weapon’s here someplace in a thousand pieces.
61,00:04:24,00:04:26,We have to find it and put it back together again.
62,00:04:26,00:04:27,Where do we start?
63,00:04:27,00:04:29,If it’s not growing pick it up.
64,00:04:29,00:04:32,We cart everything we find back to the lab. And then what?
65,00:04:32,00:04:35,Stay curious.
66,00:04:36,00:04:38,Can you fill in the blanks?
67,00:04:38,00:04:39,WILLOWS: Bombs explode.
68,00:04:39,00:04:42,Weird thing is their components survive the explosion.
69,00:04:42,00:04:45,If we can piece together this bomb we’re closer to finding who did this.
70,00:04:45,00:04:49,"So, Warrick, when you’re photographing this debris can you, uh...?"
71,00:04:49,00:04:52,"Uh, I know, looky-loos."
72,00:04:55,00:04:58,( indistinct chatter )
73,00:05:38,00:05:41,"Come on, Nick, it’s my last night in Sin City."
74,00:05:41,00:05:42,"One more drink, man."
75,00:05:42,00:05:43,"Oh, no, I just pulled a double."
76,00:05:43,00:05:45,And I still have to file my shift report.
77,00:05:45,00:05:47,"Man, you’re off the clock."
78,00:05:47,00:05:50,You’d have never passed up a wild night back at A&amp;M.
79,00:05:50,00:05:52,"Well, I guess I grew up."
80,00:05:52,00:05:53,"Too bad, check that out."
81,00:06:00,00:06:01,Enjoy.
82,00:06:01,00:06:03,"You must really love your job, man."
83,00:06:05,00:06:06,Ladies...
84,00:06:14,00:06:16,"Here you go. Thanks, man."
85,00:06:16,00:06:17,WOMAN: Get your hands off me!
86,00:06:17,00:06:19,"MAN: Kristy, you’re not going anywhere."
87,00:06:19,00:06:21,You got that?
88,00:06:21,00:06:23,Come on. Relax a little bit.
89,00:06:23,00:06:24,Settle down.
90,00:06:24,00:06:26,"Kristy? Kristy! You don’t own me, Jack."
91,00:06:26,00:06:27,Nobody does.
92,00:06:27,00:06:28,Hey.
93,00:06:28,00:06:29,Back off.
94,00:06:29,00:06:30,"Hey, just mind your own business. Nick."
95,00:06:30,00:06:32,I know him. He’s a cop.
96,00:06:32,00:06:34,A crime scene investigator.
97,00:06:34,00:06:36,"Nick, tell him to leave me alone."
98,00:06:36,00:06:39,Nobody tells me to do anything...
99,00:06:39,00:06:40,"Hey, are we going to have a problem?"
100,00:06:40,00:06:45,"No, officer, we’re not going to have a problem."
101,00:06:45,00:06:46,"I’ll see you around, baby."
102,00:06:55,00:06:57,You okay?
103,00:06:57,00:06:58,Yeah.
104,00:06:58,00:07:00,"Yeah, I’m fine."
105,00:07:00,00:07:02,That was good timing. Thanks.
106,00:07:02,00:07:05,I suppose you need a ride.
107,00:07:05,00:07:07,Do you mind?
108,00:07:07,00:07:09,No.
109,00:07:09,00:07:11,Come on.
110,00:07:11,00:07:12,Thanks.
111,00:07:14,00:07:18,WOMAN: Seems like every time we run into each other I’m getting into trouble.
112,00:07:18,00:07:22,Not that it’s any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.
113,00:07:22,00:07:25,Not every john is like that guy.
114,00:07:25,00:07:28,"Besides, I’m making a change."
115,00:07:28,00:07:30,I’m going back to school.
116,00:07:30,00:07:32,Yeah?
117,00:07:32,00:07:34,I’ve always wanted to study communications.
118,00:07:34,00:07:35,I’m good with people.
119,00:07:35,00:07:38,That’s good.
120,00:07:38,00:07:40,You think so?
121,00:07:40,00:07:42,"Yeah, I do."
122,00:07:42,00:07:45,"Well, I’m going to go inside now."
123,00:07:47,00:07:52,"Unless, of course, you’d like to come in for a drink."
124,00:07:52,00:07:55,I don’t think that’d be a good idea.
125,00:07:55,00:07:56,Come on.
126,00:07:56,00:08:00,Just ’cause you’re a crime scene analyst you don’t have to analyze everything.
127,00:08:00,00:08:02,( laughs )
128,00:08:25,00:08:36,"WILLOWS: ""FP."" MAN: Mr. Grissom."
129,00:08:39,00:08:40,"Oh, uh..."
130,00:08:40,00:08:42,"Hi, I’ve..."
131,00:08:42,00:08:44,"I’ve, um, I’ve seen you on TV before."
132,00:08:44,00:08:46,I admire your work.
133,00:08:46,00:08:47,"Well, thank you."
134,00:08:47,00:08:48,And your name is...?
135,00:08:48,00:08:49,Dominic.
136,00:08:49,00:08:53,"Uh, ""i-c"" rather than with the ""i-c-k""... uh, Kretzker."
137,00:08:53,00:08:56,"I’m the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail."
138,00:08:56,00:08:58,Did somebody from Homicide talk to you yet?
139,00:08:58,00:09:01,"Yeah, as a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you."
140,00:09:01,00:09:02,"Because, well, we are..."
141,00:09:02,00:09:04,"you know, we’re both in law enforcement, and..."
142,00:09:04,00:09:06,Right.
143,00:09:06,00:09:09,Did you know the victim-- the other security guard?
144,00:09:09,00:09:11,"Oh, yeah, he was one of my best buddies."
145,00:09:11,00:09:16,"As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes’ difference it would’ve been my face all over the news instead of his, right?"
146,00:09:16,00:09:19,"Would you, uh, like to be on the news?"
147,00:09:19,00:09:19,Yeah.
148,00:09:19,00:09:21,Yeah.
149,00:09:21,00:09:23,"I mean... only if I could help people, yes."
150,00:09:23,00:09:24,"No, no."
151,00:09:24,00:09:26,I know what you’re thinking.
152,00:09:26,00:09:30,"Uh, you know, my building blows up I’m over at Arby’s sucking down some extra sauce."
153,00:09:30,00:09:32,"You know, how could I want to help people, right?"
154,00:09:32,00:09:34,"Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?"
155,00:09:34,00:09:36,"Well, I know a lot about bombs."
156,00:09:36,00:09:38,"You know, pipe, power, powder."
157,00:09:38,00:09:41,"The three ""Ps"" of mass destruction."
158,00:09:41,00:09:42,Huh.
159,00:09:42,00:09:44,Dominic...
160,00:09:44,00:09:45,"with an ""i-c,"" not ""i-c-k""... Yes sir?"
161,00:09:45,00:09:48,Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?
162,00:09:48,00:09:51,Are you serious?
163,00:09:52,00:09:54,"Yeah, yes, sir."
164,00:09:54,00:09:56,"I’ll be honored, sir."
165,00:09:56,00:09:58,Oh.
166,00:09:58,00:10:02,"But we can’t tell anybody on the day shift, though because they’re going to get real jealous."
167,00:10:02,00:10:04,That’s good thinking.
168,00:10:04,00:10:06,Would you excuse me a minute?
169,00:10:06,00:10:08,Yes.
170,00:10:10,00:10:12,Keep an eye on that guy.
171,00:10:13,00:10:15,"Oh, yes!"
172,00:10:15,00:10:18,"Well, we got a live one out there."
173,00:10:18,00:10:20,I got a cop babysitting him.
174,00:10:20,00:10:22,How are you doing?
175,00:10:22,00:10:25,"Well, are his initials ""FP""?"
176,00:10:25,00:10:29,"No, Dominic Kretzker, why?"
177,00:10:29,00:10:32,I found this near the point of origin.
178,00:10:33,00:10:37,Whoever did this is playing with us.
179,00:10:37,00:10:39,Or he wants to get caught.
180,00:10:45,00:10:47,"Hey, it’s me."
181,00:10:47,00:10:48,You in the shower? What are you doing?
182,00:10:48,00:10:52,"Anyway, if you check your messages I don’t have to work till later."
183,00:10:52,00:10:56,So I thought since you’re between careers you might want to grab a late...
184,00:10:56,00:10:58,breakfast.
185,00:11:02,00:11:04,"Hey, Nick, what’s up?"
186,00:11:04,00:11:06,Not a lot. What’s... what’s going on?
187,00:11:06,00:11:07,It’s a 4-19.
188,00:11:07,00:11:09,Dead prostitute.
189,00:11:09,00:11:12,Who’s the decedent?
190,00:11:12,00:11:14,Kristine Marie Hopkins.
191,00:11:14,00:11:16,Day shift’s got it covered.
192,00:11:18,00:11:19,You all right?
193,00:11:19,00:11:20,"Yeah, I must’ve, uh..."
194,00:11:20,00:11:21,I must’ve got my wires crossed.
195,00:11:21,00:11:22,I’ll see you.
196,00:11:22,00:11:24,"All right, man."
197,00:11:27,00:11:31,"All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right?"
198,00:11:31,00:11:33,"Then you cap it here, and you cap it here."
199,00:11:33,00:11:36,"Now, the grains inside, all right..."
200,00:11:36,00:11:39,they’re going to ignite and they’re gonna cause smoke.
201,00:11:39,00:11:41,Lots and lots of smoke.
202,00:11:41,00:11:44,"Now, the problem is is all this smoke here, man, it’s got nowhere to go."
203,00:11:44,00:11:47,"Okay, it starts cooking, and then..."
204,00:11:47,00:11:49,Bob’s your uncle... Boom!
205,00:11:49,00:11:52,Grissom was right: you do know a lot about bombs.
206,00:11:52,00:11:53,How’d you learn so much?
207,00:11:53,00:11:55,"Oh, they don’t teach this stuff at universities."
208,00:11:55,00:11:56,"You know, this is all trial and error."
209,00:11:56,00:12:00,"So what, you just, uh, blow up bombs and study them?"
210,00:12:00,00:12:01,Yeah. Yeah...
211,00:12:01,00:12:02,( knocking )
212,00:12:02,00:12:04,"Margaret Finn, Public Defender."
213,00:12:04,00:12:06,Cease and desist any conversation with my client.
214,00:12:06,00:12:08,I’ve been assigned to you.
215,00:12:08,00:12:12,Guess the PD was thinking of all the lawsuits Richard Jewell brought when he was wrongfully accused.
216,00:12:12,00:12:15,Someone died in that office building.
217,00:12:15,00:12:19,"Ma’am, you seem like a very nice person but these people--they’ve been very, very good to me."
218,00:12:19,00:12:21,I’m sure they have.
219,00:12:21,00:12:24,"Dominic, I think you should roll with your attorney."
220,00:12:24,00:12:26,"Thanks for your help, though."
221,00:12:26,00:12:27,All right.
222,00:12:27,00:12:28,I’ll see you guys later.
223,00:12:28,00:12:29,"Listen, do me a favor."
224,00:12:29,00:12:33,"Will you tell Grissom that if he needs me just call me at home, okay? All right."
225,00:12:33,00:12:34,Let’s roll.
226,00:12:36,00:12:40,So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin?
227,00:12:40,00:12:41,Yep.
228,00:12:41,00:12:44,How could the victim possibly have been in one piece?
229,00:12:44,00:12:46,Vacuum effect.
230,00:12:46,00:12:49,The air is being pushed out so fast...
231,00:12:49,00:12:52,and the bomb detonates...
232,00:12:52,00:12:54,there’s a calm at the center...
233,00:12:58,00:13:02,"Calm, huh? Well, except for when he lost his ears."
234,00:13:02,00:13:04,"Did you figure out what this ""FP"" stands for?"
235,00:13:04,00:13:07,I ran it through ATF’s bomb database.
236,00:13:07,00:13:09,No profile.
237,00:13:09,00:13:11,So our bomber’s a newbie.
238,00:13:11,00:13:13,Does he fit Grissom’s wack job from the bomb site?
239,00:13:13,00:13:15,Dominic the security guard?
240,00:13:15,00:13:17,"Ah, it’s too soon to tell."
241,00:13:17,00:13:19,I found something interesting.
242,00:13:19,00:13:21,What is it?
243,00:13:23,00:13:25,Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.
244,00:13:25,00:13:26,Bomb was time-delayed.
245,00:13:26,00:13:28,This is a piece of the timing device.
246,00:13:28,00:13:30,What about the orange stuff?
247,00:13:30,00:13:34,Heat of the explosion must’ve melted whatever it is all around the wheel.
248,00:13:34,00:13:36,So Sara?
249,00:13:36,00:13:39,So what’s orange and melts?
250,00:13:39,00:13:41,I would have to investigate that.
251,00:13:41,00:13:42,Thank you.
252,00:13:42,00:13:44,"Hey, guys."
253,00:13:44,00:13:45,Can I steal you for a minute?
254,00:13:45,00:13:46,I thought this was your day off.
255,00:13:46,00:13:47,"We’re kind of busy here, Nick."
256,00:13:47,00:13:50,"Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry, but I don’t think this can wait."
257,00:13:50,00:13:52,Okay.
258,00:13:56,00:13:59,You told me you weren’t dating her.
259,00:13:59,00:14:04,"I wasn’t till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh... Jack."
260,00:14:04,00:14:07,And Ecklie’s at her house now.
261,00:14:07,00:14:09,"Yeah, and I can tell you what he’s going to find."
262,00:14:09,00:14:12,"My fingerprints, my DNA."
263,00:14:12,00:14:14,"What were you thinking, Nicky?"
264,00:14:14,00:14:17,I wasn’t.
265,00:14:17,00:14:21,"We had a connection, you know?"
266,00:14:21,00:14:24,"Chemistry thing, I guess."
267,00:14:24,00:14:27,"She was irresistible, man."
268,00:14:27,00:14:30,I took off around 4:00.
269,00:14:30,00:14:31,Ecklie’s going to be all over this.
270,00:14:31,00:14:32,( knocking )
271,00:14:32,00:14:35,"Hey, Nick..."
272,00:14:35,00:14:37,I’m sorry to hear about your friend.
273,00:14:37,00:14:39,Who told you?
274,00:14:39,00:14:40,Word travels.
275,00:14:40,00:14:42,It was the day shift coroner.
276,00:14:42,00:14:44,So people know I was with Kristy last night?
277,00:14:44,00:14:46,Not yet.
278,00:14:46,00:14:49,Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there.
279,00:14:49,00:14:53,"When you’re a suspect and you’re innocent, you keep your mouth shut."
280,00:14:54,00:14:56,I’ll talk to Ecklie.
281,00:14:56,00:14:57,Bad idea. You and Ecklie...
282,00:14:57,00:14:58,oil and water.
283,00:14:58,00:15:00,Just let me get into it.
284,00:15:00,00:15:02,I can’t just sit here.
285,00:15:02,00:15:04,"Okay, go for a walk."
286,00:15:04,00:15:09,"Maybe you’ll accidentally bump into your guy, ""Jack?"" Yeah."
287,00:15:09,00:15:12,"I.D. him, but don’t approach him."
288,00:15:12,00:15:14,Okay.
289,00:15:19,00:15:23,If Nick’s arrested it’s not going to matter that he’s cleared later.
290,00:15:23,00:15:25,"No, it’s an automatic dismissal."
291,00:15:30,00:15:33,25-year-old female Caucasian.
292,00:15:33,00:15:38,Liver temp’s indicating time of death at 0600.
293,00:15:38,00:15:42,"Petichial hemorrhaging, cyanotic tongue."
294,00:15:42,00:15:44,( door opens )
295,00:15:44,00:15:45,"Can I help you, Catherine?"
296,00:15:45,00:15:46,"I just want to see the body, David."
297,00:15:46,00:15:48,"Unless I’m mistaken, this is Ecklie’s case."
298,00:15:48,00:15:50,"Eyes, no hands."
299,00:15:52,00:15:54,Look at those ligature marks.
300,00:15:54,00:15:56,Petichials...
301,00:15:56,00:15:57,"blue tongue, the works."
302,00:15:57,00:16:00,Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck.
303,00:16:00,00:16:02,She didn’t give up easy.
304,00:16:02,00:16:04,Struggled and strangled.
305,00:16:04,00:16:06,Ecklie find the murder weapon?
306,00:16:06,00:16:08,I only deal with bodies.
307,00:16:08,00:16:10,Did you check for fingerprints on the body?
308,00:16:10,00:16:14,Not yet. Half-life of fingerprints on flesh they’re disappearing as we speak.
309,00:16:14,00:16:15,"Catherine, I like Nick, too."
310,00:16:15,00:16:17,I know you’re here for him.
311,00:16:17,00:16:19,But what if I lift his prints from her?
312,00:16:19,00:16:21,Then that’s what you report.
313,00:16:21,00:16:25,"Evidence, Doc... all we got."
314,00:16:25,00:16:28,( ticking )
315,00:16:34,00:16:35,( alarm ringing )
316,00:16:35,00:16:36,Hey.
317,00:16:36,00:16:38,"Could you find that and turn it off, please?"
318,00:16:38,00:16:41,( alarm ringing )
319,00:16:44,00:16:46,( alarm stops )
320,00:16:46,00:16:48,Find the clock our guy used?
321,00:16:48,00:16:49,Not yet.
322,00:16:49,00:16:50,This is a good choice.
323,00:16:50,00:17:08,"According to the Bomb Data Center which has a record of every component used in any bomb-- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks-- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell Snoozewell, $10.99 at any local drugstore."
324,00:17:08,00:17:10,You’ve spoiled all my fun.
325,00:17:11,00:17:13,"Gris, can I get clear on something here?"
326,00:17:13,00:17:14,Anything’s possible.
327,00:17:14,00:17:21,"Catherine gave me this ""FP"" which was part of the Hansen bomb and I’m supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it."
328,00:17:21,00:17:23,"You isolate the tool, and then we trace it."
329,00:17:23,00:17:27,"Yeah, but he could’ve used any number of things to initial it."
330,00:17:27,00:17:29,"I mean, a screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter."
331,00:17:29,00:17:30,It’s the same as guns...
332,00:17:30,00:17:33,we eliminate them one at a time.
333,00:17:33,00:17:34,What are you guys doing?
334,00:17:34,00:17:37,We’re going to go blow up some bombs.
335,00:17:37,00:17:41,"Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation."
336,00:17:41,00:17:44,Alas. Poor Warrick.
337,00:18:15,00:18:17,( buzzing )
338,00:18:19,00:18:20,( knocking )
339,00:18:20,00:18:23,"Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom’s in the field."
340,00:18:23,00:18:25,I need to speak with him.
341,00:18:25,00:18:27,And I need to speak with you...
342,00:18:27,00:18:28,about Nick Stokes.
343,00:18:28,00:18:29,"Well, let me guess..."
344,00:18:29,00:18:31,about his involvement with a dead hooker?
345,00:18:31,00:18:34,Come on. The hooker was a person.
346,00:18:34,00:18:35,Her name was Kristy Hopkins.
347,00:18:35,00:18:36,I realize that. Thank you.
348,00:18:36,00:18:38,I just came from the lab.
349,00:18:38,00:18:40,His prints were all over Kristy Hopkins’ house.
350,00:18:40,00:18:43,"Let’s see, wine glass..."
351,00:18:43,00:18:44,"oh, bedside table."
352,00:18:44,00:18:46,"How’s it going, Cath?"
353,00:18:46,00:18:49,"Nick, I don’t think that you guys should be talking."
354,00:18:49,00:18:51,It’s no big deal.
355,00:18:51,00:18:52,"What’s up, Ecklie?"
356,00:18:52,00:18:55,"I need a DNA sample from you, Nick."
357,00:18:55,00:18:59,I assume you’re trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night.
358,00:18:59,00:19:01,"We found a condom, used."
359,00:19:01,00:19:04,"And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary."
360,00:19:04,00:19:06,And I have something else for you.
361,00:19:08,00:19:10,I got this off a valet surveillance tape.
362,00:19:10,00:19:12,A license plate number?
363,00:19:12,00:19:14,Vehicle belongs to Jack Willman.
364,00:19:14,00:19:17,Had a fight with Kristy Hopkins outside the Orpheus last night around midnight.
365,00:19:17,00:19:23,"Well, I’ll look into it but come on, your fingerprints, your DNA that’s what’s going into evidence."
366,00:19:23,00:19:25,"You just love that, don’t you?"
367,00:19:25,00:19:27,You think I want to believe that a CSI could commit murder?
368,00:19:27,00:19:30,"Hell, I don’t even want to believe that a CSI could sleep with a hooker."
369,00:19:30,00:19:31,You know what? Nick’s private life...
370,00:19:31,00:19:32,Is no longer private.
371,00:19:32,00:19:36,"Catherine, I’m sorry if you guys don’t like where the evidence is pointing."
372,00:19:36,00:19:38,"But show me otherwise, tell me I’m wrong."
373,00:19:38,00:19:40,"In the meantime, my hands are tied."
374,00:19:40,00:19:42,I have protocol to follow.
375,00:19:46,00:19:47,I hate that guy.
376,00:19:47,00:19:50,"Okay, look, I’m going to get O’Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning."
377,00:19:50,00:19:52,"But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick."
378,00:19:52,00:19:54,"Just don’t make it harder with Ecklie, okay?"
379,00:19:54,00:19:55,Yeah.
380,00:19:57,00:19:59,GRISSOM: We find the bomber by understanding the bomb.
381,00:19:59,00:20:02,"Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container."
382,00:20:02,00:20:04,Aluminum briefcase.
383,00:20:04,00:20:05,And we know the timing device.
384,00:20:05,00:20:06,Snoozewell.
385,00:20:06,00:20:07,And the propellant.
386,00:20:07,00:20:08,Black gunpowder.
387,00:20:08,00:20:10,So the final piece of the bomber’s signature?
388,00:20:10,00:20:12,Identify the pipe containing the powder.
389,00:20:12,00:20:16,"Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes."
390,00:20:16,00:20:20,Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied.
391,00:20:20,00:20:22,Number one is a plumber’s ex-flow pipe.
392,00:20:22,00:20:24,Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner.
393,00:20:24,00:20:28,Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.
394,00:20:35,00:20:36,You ready?
395,00:20:38,00:20:40,"Let’s do it, Dan."
396,00:20:47,00:20:48,Green.
397,00:20:48,00:20:49,That’s the ex-flow pipe.
398,00:20:51,00:20:54,"Inflow pipe, blue."
399,00:20:59,00:21:02,"Red, the galvanized steel."
400,00:21:14,00:21:17,Last piece of green: ten feet.
401,00:21:32,00:21:36,Blue: 16 feet.
402,00:21:45,00:21:48,Red: 20 feet.
403,00:21:55,00:21:59,Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.
404,00:21:59,00:22:03,20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.
405,00:22:03,00:22:06,That’s the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.
406,00:22:06,00:22:11,So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel.
407,00:22:11,00:22:14,Like a muffler or a tailpipe.
408,00:22:14,00:22:16,I’ve seen it before.
409,00:22:16,00:22:17,It’s a common container for homemades.
410,00:22:17,00:22:20,Don’t you love the smell of sulfur in the afternoon?
411,00:22:20,00:22:23,You might want to go and take a tour of Dominic Kretzker’s house.
412,00:22:23,00:22:25,I tracked down the sale of Snoozewell clocks.
413,00:22:25,00:22:29,926 credit card purchases in the last three months in Clark County.
414,00:22:29,00:22:32,Seven to Dominic Kretzker of Prairie Road.
415,00:22:55,00:22:59,( indistinct police radio chatter )
416,00:22:59,00:23:01,"Hey, hey. That your scanner?"
417,00:23:01,00:23:04,"Yeah, that’s how I knew you were coming."
418,00:23:04,00:23:06,Makes me feel like I’m part of things.
419,00:23:06,00:23:08,Mr. Grissom.
420,00:23:08,00:23:10,What can I do for you guys?
421,00:23:10,00:23:15,Dominic... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb.
422,00:23:15,00:23:19,We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock.
423,00:23:19,00:23:22,"Yeah, yeah, I recognize that."
424,00:23:22,00:23:24,That houses a nice little detonator.
425,00:23:24,00:23:27,Want to show us that clock of yours?
426,00:23:27,00:23:29,"Oh, sure. Come on in."
427,00:23:32,00:23:34,The place is kind of a mess. Sorry.
428,00:23:34,00:23:35,Here.
429,00:23:35,00:23:38,( straining ): Here it is.
430,00:23:39,00:23:41,TimeTell Snoozewell.
431,00:23:41,00:23:43,$10.99.
432,00:23:43,00:23:46,"Well, you can get it for half price if you’ve got a coupon."
433,00:23:46,00:23:48,The timing device is still intact.
434,00:23:48,00:23:50,"Yeah, ’cause I haven’t made the bomb yet."
435,00:23:50,00:23:53,"But you have made bombs before, using parts from this make?"
436,00:23:53,00:23:54,"Well, yeah."
437,00:23:54,00:23:57,"Yeah, I blow them out in back all the time."
438,00:23:57,00:23:59,I blasted a few of them a couple months ago.
439,00:23:59,00:24:02,"BRASS: Hey, look what I found."
440,00:24:02,00:24:02,Sulfur.
441,00:24:02,00:24:05,You blow up any bombs recently?
442,00:24:10,00:24:11,Is this from the Hansen bomb?
443,00:24:11,00:24:13,Sure is.
444,00:24:13,00:24:15,You’re keeping a key piece of evidence that could nail you?
445,00:24:15,00:24:17,"Hey, that’s sentimental."
446,00:24:17,00:24:19,"Well, that’s cute."
447,00:24:19,00:24:20,"No, I mean, it is."
448,00:24:20,00:24:23,"That’s like, you know, Waco and Trade Center."
449,00:24:23,00:24:25,"I mean, that’s historical."
450,00:24:25,00:24:27,"I didn’t have a war, all right?"
451,00:24:27,00:24:28,I’m too flatfooted for the P.D.
452,00:24:28,00:24:30,and that’s as close to history as I’m going to get.
453,00:24:30,00:24:31,I collect souvenirs.
454,00:24:31,00:24:33,"I mean, th-that’s my building, you know."
455,00:24:33,00:24:37,"I mean... that was my place of employment, man."
456,00:24:37,00:24:40,"You’re going to be sorry, talking to my client."
457,00:24:40,00:24:41,BRASS: We called you. We left word.
458,00:24:41,00:24:43,"Dominic, don’t speak."
459,00:24:43,00:24:45,"If I had anything to hide, I’d hide it."
460,00:24:45,00:24:48,"I’m pretty proud of that container piece, I’ll tell you."
461,00:24:48,00:24:51,"BRASS: Well, maybe so but you’re under arrest."
462,00:24:51,00:24:53,Put him in the car.
463,00:24:53,00:24:55,You-you kidding?
464,00:24:56,00:24:57,Oh.
465,00:24:59,00:25:00,( siren approaching ) Cuffs?
466,00:25:00,00:25:04,"BRASS: Those vultures never sleep, huh?"
467,00:25:06,00:25:08,Could you do me a favor?
468,00:25:08,00:25:10,Can you put the jacket over them?
469,00:25:10,00:25:12,I don’t want to be seen like this.
470,00:25:12,00:25:13,Not on TV.
471,00:25:13,00:25:15,This is not who I am.
472,00:25:18,00:25:20,"Thanks, partner."
473,00:25:23,00:25:29,GRISSOM: I can’t tell whether he’s brilliant or... nuts.
474,00:25:29,00:25:30,Sound familiar?
475,00:25:30,00:25:34,Tell you one thing if he’s guilty he’s putting on one hell of a show.
476,00:26:10,00:26:13,Polyethylene? Terephtalete?
477,00:26:20,00:26:21,( clears throat )
478,00:26:21,00:26:23,You contact her family?
479,00:26:23,00:26:25,No family to speak of.
480,00:26:25,00:26:27,Has anyone claimed her?
481,00:26:27,00:26:29,"For burial? Friend, old roommate?"
482,00:26:29,00:26:30,There’s no one.
483,00:26:30,00:26:31,City’ll be footing the bill.
484,00:26:35,00:26:37,"No, I’ll pay."
485,00:26:37,00:26:39,Sure that’s prudent given the circumstances?
486,00:26:39,00:26:43,"Doc, I’m giving this girl a proper burial."
487,00:26:44,00:26:46,I don’t much care about my career right now.
488,00:26:46,00:26:49,Someone wants to throw me in jail for that so be it.
489,00:26:52,00:26:54,( cell door closing )
490,00:26:56,00:27:01,How you doing? Just kind of using the current experience to understand the other side of law enforcement.
491,00:27:01,00:27:03,That’s resourceful.
492,00:27:03,00:27:06,"You think I’m guilty, don’t you?"
493,00:27:06,00:27:11,I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement.
494,00:27:11,00:27:12,That is crazy.
495,00:27:12,00:27:13,"I mean, come on."
496,00:27:13,00:27:15,I’m one of the good guys.
497,00:27:15,00:27:17,The cops went through my things.
498,00:27:17,00:27:18,They find anything?
499,00:27:18,00:27:19,"Dominic, you have an attorney now."
500,00:27:19,00:27:21,I can’t really talk to you about the case.
501,00:27:21,00:27:26,I was here on another matter and I thought I’d come by.
502,00:27:26,00:27:27,You do what I do.
503,00:27:27,00:27:28,Excuse me?
504,00:27:28,00:27:38,"You don’t just like, stop by to see someone, you... make up excuse like ""I’m in the area, just stopping by."" Wow, you’re just like me."
505,00:27:38,00:27:41,Except better-looking.
506,00:27:41,00:27:44,"I’ll come by and see you later, okay?"
507,00:27:44,00:27:45,Okay.
508,00:27:51,00:27:53,What? Bad news.
509,00:27:53,00:27:54,Another Fourth of July.
510,00:27:54,00:27:57,Where? Thrift-Right Car Rental on Flamingo.
511,00:27:57,00:27:58,Ten minutes ago.
512,00:28:03,00:28:06,( indistinct police radio chatter )
513,00:28:08,00:28:12,"BRASS: So, the manager was working the lot when he heard the blast."
514,00:28:12,00:28:17,Fatality was on the check-in line and died on the way to the hospital.
515,00:28:17,00:28:19,Anybody report hearing a noise? Ticking?
516,00:28:19,00:28:20,"No, no one heard anything."
517,00:28:20,00:28:24,"SIDLE: Ah, it’s not the firemen it’s the rain. This crime scene is trashed."
518,00:28:30,00:28:32,What do you have?
519,00:28:32,00:28:34,Form follows function.
520,00:28:34,00:28:36,They’ve never been able to make a better one.
521,00:28:36,00:28:38,Mousetrap.
522,00:28:38,00:28:40,That orange stuff again.
523,00:28:40,00:28:45,"Someone picks it up, motion trips the trap, sets off the timer."
524,00:28:45,00:28:48,SIDLE: Which sets off the bomb.
525,00:28:48,00:28:49,( explosion )
526,00:28:53,00:28:56,Be right back.
527,00:28:56,00:28:57,We say nothing to the media or anybody.
528,00:28:57,00:29:00,Our bomber’s signature just got a little more sophisticated.
529,00:29:00,00:29:02,Excuse me.
530,00:29:02,00:29:03,"Hi, I’m with the Crime Lab."
531,00:29:03,00:29:06,"I’m sorry, but I have to take your jacket."
532,00:29:06,00:29:09,Um... okay.
533,00:29:09,00:29:10,If it’ll help.
534,00:29:10,00:29:12,Thanks.
535,00:29:15,00:29:17,What are you doing?
536,00:29:17,00:29:20,Polyethylene-terephtalete.
537,00:29:20,00:29:21,Polyester.
538,00:29:21,00:29:23,Orange stuff.
539,00:29:25,00:29:28,GRISSOM: You’re free to go.
540,00:29:28,00:29:30,I wanted to tell you in person.
541,00:29:30,00:29:32,"You mean, you weren’t just in the neighborhood?"
542,00:29:32,00:29:35,"That second bomb-- it wasn’t remote, was it?"
543,00:29:35,00:29:36,Otherwise I’d still be a suspect.
544,00:29:36,00:29:38,I can’t discuss it.
545,00:29:38,00:29:42,So I guess you’re not going to be needing my expertise anymore.
546,00:29:42,00:29:44,"I mean, investigation-wise."
547,00:29:44,00:29:47,I knew it was too good to be true.
548,00:29:47,00:29:51,"Well, proud to have worked with you, sir."
549,00:29:51,00:29:53,Dominic... I’m not a police officer.
550,00:29:53,00:29:55,I-I-I’m a crime scene analyst.
551,00:29:55,00:29:58,"Yeah, but we know who really solves the crimes, don’t we, sir?"
552,00:29:58,00:30:01,Good luck.
553,00:30:01,00:30:02,Take care of yourself.
554,00:30:02,00:30:03,Thank you.
555,00:30:06,00:30:08,"Hey, Dom?"
556,00:30:08,00:30:13,Yeah? Next time try not to be quite so trusting.
557,00:30:13,00:30:15,You don’t need to be a hero.
558,00:30:24,00:30:26,I ran priors.
559,00:30:26,00:30:30,The guy’s got an ’88 conviction for sexual assault.
560,00:30:30,00:30:33,"Boy, if I ever get in trouble, I know which CSI I’m going to."
561,00:30:35,00:30:38,Let’s watch the show.
562,00:30:44,00:30:48,How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins?
563,00:30:48,00:30:50,"Oh, sir, we can just cut the crap."
564,00:30:50,00:30:52,I saw him kill Kristy.
565,00:30:52,00:30:54,I saw everything.
566,00:30:54,00:30:55,O’RILEY: Go on.
567,00:30:55,00:30:58,"Well, Kristy and I, we had words."
568,00:30:58,00:31:02,"I was swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry but, uh..."
569,00:31:04,00:31:07,I didn’t expect to see her with a guy.
570,00:31:07,00:31:08,They were fighting.
571,00:31:08,00:31:12,I couldn’t make out what they were saying but he was pushing her around pretty hard.
572,00:31:12,00:31:14,( arguing )
573,00:31:14,00:31:16,Could you I.D. this guy? Yeah.
574,00:31:16,00:31:18,"It was like, Nick something."
575,00:31:18,00:31:22,Kristy and I bumped into him at The Orpheus earlier.
576,00:31:22,00:31:23,O’RILEY: And you saw him kill her?
577,00:31:23,00:31:27,"Well, I saw him get violent, but then I took off."
578,00:31:27,00:31:29,And you didn’t try to help the girl?
579,00:31:29,00:31:31,He’s one of you guys.
580,00:31:31,00:31:33,He carries a gun.
581,00:31:33,00:31:35,I’m no hero.
582,00:31:39,00:31:41,So can I go?
583,00:31:43,00:31:46,O’RILEY: Yeah.
584,00:31:47,00:31:50,The witness sounds believable.
585,00:31:50,00:31:52,It’s a load of crap and you know it.
586,00:31:52,00:31:54,I was listening.
587,00:31:54,00:31:56,He seemed credible to me.
588,00:31:56,00:31:59,"Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career."
589,00:31:59,00:32:01,So what can you offer me?
590,00:32:01,00:32:04,"Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience."
591,00:32:04,00:32:05,He didn’t do this.
592,00:32:05,00:32:10,Ignore the evidence against Stokes it looks like special favors for CSI.
593,00:32:10,00:32:11,"Well, I can’t have that."
594,00:32:11,00:32:12,Not and keep my post.
595,00:32:12,00:32:17,"So give me 12 hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick."
596,00:32:17,00:32:20,12 hours.
597,00:32:20,00:32:26,But then we arrest Mr. Stokes with all the attendant documentation.
598,00:32:40,00:32:42,"How you doing, Greg?"
599,00:32:42,00:32:43,Same as you.
600,00:32:43,00:32:44,Yeah. Worried about Nick.
601,00:32:44,00:32:47,I need to see his DNA from the crime scene.
602,00:32:47,00:32:48,"You have it, right?"
603,00:32:48,00:32:50,"A sample from the condom, yeah."
604,00:32:50,00:32:52,Popsicled in the freezer.
605,00:32:52,00:32:54,"But, uh, it’s not your case."
606,00:32:54,00:32:57,"Much as I want to help, no can do."
607,00:32:57,00:32:59,It’s my case for the next 12 hours.
608,00:32:59,00:33:02,Ask the Sheriff.
609,00:33:02,00:33:04,"You know, I would never doubt your word."
610,00:33:04,00:33:06,Smart man.
611,00:33:13,00:33:15,Nick’s little soldiers.
612,00:33:15,00:33:17,It’s all you.
613,00:33:17,00:33:20,"Thanks, Greg."
614,00:33:20,00:33:24,WILLOWS: When did you say this sample was frozen?
615,00:33:24,00:33:25,"Um, 10:15 a.m."
616,00:33:25,00:33:26,Why?
617,00:33:26,00:33:30,"These guys are all heads, no tails."
618,00:33:30,00:33:33,"That’s normal, given the post-ejaculate time frame."
619,00:33:33,00:33:35,How is that going to help Nick?
620,00:33:35,00:33:40,WILLOWS: The sperm found in the condom was frozen at 10:15 a.m.
621,00:33:40,00:33:42,"It’s all heads, no tails."
622,00:33:42,00:33:44,I’m not quite up to speed on the particulars of...
623,00:33:44,00:33:50,It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 a.m.
624,00:33:50,00:33:52,but Kristy’s time of death was 6:00 a.m.
625,00:33:52,00:33:59,"Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy’s murder but it doesn’t disprove Nick’s presence at the time of the homicide."
626,00:33:59,00:34:01,You could be a little more supportive.
627,00:34:03,00:34:05,I have a new favorite color.
628,00:34:05,00:34:10,Orange? The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the Thrift-Right jacket.
629,00:34:10,00:34:13,Guess where their regional headquarters is located.
630,00:34:13,00:34:14,The Hansen Building. You bet.
631,00:34:14,00:34:20,"I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against Thrift-Right."
632,00:34:20,00:34:22,You get any hits? Norman Stirling.
633,00:34:22,00:34:24,Former manager.
634,00:34:24,00:34:27,How disgruntled? Let go last year.
635,00:34:27,00:34:28,Caused a commotion at H.Q.
636,00:34:28,00:34:31,Filed lawsuits against the company.
637,00:34:31,00:34:33,Guy’s been out of work ever since.
638,00:34:33,00:34:36,Sitting around making bombs.
639,00:34:42,00:34:44,Norman Stirling?
640,00:34:44,00:34:47,Yes.
641,00:34:47,00:34:49,What’s going on?
642,00:34:49,00:34:51,FP.
643,00:34:51,00:34:53,What?
644,00:34:53,00:34:55,You don’t recognize those initials?
645,00:34:58,00:35:00,What’s this about?
646,00:35:00,00:35:01,The bombing of the Thrift-Right Car Rental.
647,00:35:01,00:35:03,The bombing of the Hansen Building.
648,00:35:03,00:35:05,A-A bomb? Are you kidding?
649,00:35:05,00:35:08,I’ve never even been near a bomb my entire life.
650,00:35:08,00:35:14,"Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in."
651,00:35:14,00:35:16,I used to wear those to go to work.
652,00:35:16,00:35:20,"BRASS: You were let go by Thrift-Right last year, and lost a court battle to get your job back."
653,00:35:20,00:35:26,"BRASS: In fact, they filed a TRO against you for throwing furniture around their headquarters last July."
654,00:35:26,00:35:28,I want to call my lawyer.
655,00:35:28,00:35:30,"Good, you can call him from the car."
656,00:35:30,00:35:31,He can meet us at the PD.
657,00:35:31,00:35:32,"Take him in. Come on, let’s go."
658,00:35:32,00:35:33,Call your mom.
659,00:36:47,00:36:50,WILLOWS: Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash.
660,00:36:50,00:36:56,"It’s fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer’s hands, right?"
661,00:36:56,00:36:59,"Abraded, yeah. And can you extract DNA from epithelials?"
662,00:36:59,00:37:00,If they’re fresh enough.
663,00:37:16,00:37:20,"GREG: Okay, epithelials are an affirmative."
664,00:37:20,00:37:22,And they’re good to go for DNA profiling.
665,00:37:22,00:37:25,I’m just going to need something to compare it to.
666,00:37:25,00:37:29,Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.
667,00:37:40,00:37:42,Well?
668,00:37:44,00:37:47,I think that you and I should head over to the police station.
669,00:37:49,00:37:52,"DNA didn’t pan out, huh?"
670,00:37:52,00:37:55,Never have I seen such a clean match.
671,00:37:57,00:37:58,Jack Willman killed her.
672,00:38:08,00:38:11,( sighing )
673,00:38:11,00:38:13,Thank you.
674,00:38:13,00:38:14,Hey...
675,00:38:14,00:38:17,"Hey, I’m just doing my job."
676,00:38:17,00:38:22,"Besides, if they’d sent you to jail I’d get stuck with all your cases."
677,00:38:22,00:38:24,( laughs )
678,00:38:27,00:38:29,Dispatch said you were looking for me?
679,00:38:29,00:38:30,Yeah.
680,00:38:30,00:38:35,"I finally matched this ""FP."" To this electric etcher."
681,00:38:35,00:38:36,"Now, I made an exemplar."
682,00:38:36,00:38:37,Boom!
683,00:38:37,00:38:39,WARRICK: Identical type of striations.
684,00:38:39,00:38:45,The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes.
685,00:38:45,00:38:47,And it’s only sold in bulk.
686,00:38:47,00:38:50,It was not sold to Norman Stirling.
687,00:38:50,00:38:53,So who bought it?
688,00:38:53,00:38:55,Las Vegas School District.
689,00:38:55,00:38:58,I called the district and we traced it down to one high school-- Summit High.
690,00:38:58,00:39:03,Stirling’s son goes there.
691,00:39:03,00:39:12,"BRASS: Tyler, were you aware of your father’s lawsuits against Thrift-Right Car Rental?"
692,00:39:12,00:39:14,Yeah. It was kind of hard not to be.
693,00:39:14,00:39:19,"I mean, it’s all him and my mom talked about for a year."
694,00:39:20,00:39:22,Until she left.
695,00:39:22,00:39:24,Do you miss your mother?
696,00:39:26,00:39:28,I miss our old life.
697,00:39:31,00:39:34,( quietly ): Is there something that we should be talking about?
698,00:39:34,00:39:35,"You know, in private?"
699,00:39:35,00:39:39,You said that’s how corporations do it--in private.
700,00:39:41,00:39:45,"See, they treated him great at work, in front of everyone."
701,00:39:45,00:39:48,And then they let him go at the end of the day when no one’s around.
702,00:39:48,00:39:50,Thirty years of service and then...
703,00:39:50,00:39:54,"you know, they realized they could hire two young guys at half the price."
704,00:39:54,00:39:58,"BRASS: What does ""FP"" stand for?"
705,00:39:59,00:40:02,It was etched into both bombs.
706,00:40:02,00:40:06,We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.
707,00:40:10,00:40:24,"""Fair Play."" I used to yell that around the house that I was owed fair play."
708,00:40:24,00:40:27,"TYLER: I mean, they threw him out like trash."
709,00:40:27,00:40:29,And you sent them bombs?
710,00:40:29,00:40:34,You said you wanted to kill them.
711,00:40:39,00:40:41,How did you even know how to do this?
712,00:40:43,00:40:45,Off the Internet.
713,00:40:48,00:40:50,"Dad, are you mad at me?"
714,00:40:53,00:40:54,I did it for you.
715,00:40:54,00:40:57,"Tyler, did you make any more bombs?"
