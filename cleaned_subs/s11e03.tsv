0	00:00:35	00:00:36	No! Stop, please!
1	00:00:36	00:00:38	Don't stop.
2	00:00:47	00:00:48	Hey.
3	00:00:50	00:00:53	You know that the speed limit is not a suggestion, right?
4	00:00:53	00:00:55	You gonna give me a ticket, copper?
5	00:00:55	00:00:57	Used to bring Lindsey up here.
6	00:00:57	00:01:02	Mount Charleston always has been a hot spot for skiers and hikers and...
7	00:01:02	00:01:05	Now murderers.
8	00:01:21	00:01:23	You can see the terror in his eyes.
9	00:01:24	00:01:27	This man knew he was going to die.
10	00:01:31	00:01:33	This is a serious blood pool.
11	00:01:33	00:01:36	He was alive when his head was chopped off.
12	00:01:40	00:01:43	Still tacky.
13	00:01:43	00:01:45	Fresh kill.
14	00:01:45	00:01:52	So the park ranger said he thought he heard wolves howling, but they're not native to the area, so he came down here to check it out.
15	00:01:52	00:01:56	Looks like his body's been posed.
16	00:01:56	00:01:58	Could be some kind of a cult killing.
17	00:01:58	00:02:03	Satanic rituals are often performed in a natural setting like this, but this...
18	00:02:03	00:02:05	fence is a poor altar.
19	00:02:05	00:02:07	If this was a ritualistic killing, there would be some...
20	00:02:07	00:02:09	sign.
21	00:02:11	00:02:12	Blood moon.
22	00:02:13	00:02:19	In the Book of Revelations, it was considered to be a precursor to the end of days.
23	00:02:20	00:02:23	Well, it certainly was for this poor guy.
24	00:03:00	00:03:02	No tire tracks, no footprints.
25	00:03:02	00:03:04	I can't even see my own.
26	00:03:06	00:03:09	He's not dressed for hiking. Mm-mm.
27	00:03:09	00:03:10	He had to get out here some way.
28	00:03:10	00:03:12	Well, there's no ID on him.
29	00:03:16	00:03:18	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
30	00:03:18	00:03:21	Where is the bug man when you need him?
31	00:03:21	00:03:23	I'm right here, buddy.
32	00:03:25	00:03:28	What is that?
33	00:03:28	00:03:30	That is a long-horned beetle.
34	00:03:33	00:03:38	Nick, there's something else in his mouth, and it's not moving.
35	00:03:45	00:03:47	Hair.
36	00:03:47	00:03:48	Maybe he got a piece of his attacker.
37	00:03:48	00:03:50	(Velcro tears) Mm-hmm.
38	00:03:50	00:03:51	Guys, I'm gonna need some bigger tools.
39	00:03:51	00:03:52	Yeah, okay.
40	00:03:56	00:04:00	I've got some ligature marks on his wrist.
41	00:04:00	00:04:02	You check the other one, will you?
42	00:04:04	00:04:06	Yeah, same thing over here.
43	00:04:06	00:04:10	But these patterns are inconsistent with this barbed wire.
44	00:04:10	00:04:13	(groans) Stop, please stop!
45	00:04:13	00:04:15	Looks like somebody brought chains to the party.
46	00:04:15	00:04:19	Do you see these abrasions and cuts here in the chest?
47	00:04:19	00:04:22	They appear to have been made by the barbed wire.
48	00:04:22	00:04:27	Hmm... So, our victim ran into the barbed- wire fence, and then...
49	00:04:27	00:04:30	our killer... turned him around.
50	00:04:34	00:04:36	Killer wanted to look him in the eye.
51	00:04:36	00:04:38	It would have made the killer feel very powerful.
52	00:04:38	00:04:41	Hang on, now, Super Dave.
53	00:04:41	00:04:43	You just gonna chop him up?
54	00:04:43	00:04:48	Oh, Dr. Robbins said that he wanted the head with the pike, and the body with the fence.
55	00:04:48	00:04:50	I'll take the saw. Okay.
56	00:04:53	00:04:55	I'll grab the head? Yep.
57	00:04:55	00:04:57	Ready? Mm-hmm.
58	00:05:00	00:05:02	Okay.
59	00:05:02	00:05:04	It's like trying to get meat off a shish kebab.
60	00:05:06	00:05:08	You all right?
61	00:05:08	00:05:09	Yeah. Yeah.
62	00:05:11	00:05:14	Give me a hand, David. Mm-hmm.
63	00:05:17	00:05:24	The post went through the trachea, soft palate, and all the way into the brain.
64	00:05:25	00:05:29	Thank you. Yeah.
65	00:05:29	00:05:30	Heads or tails?
66	00:05:30	00:05:31	I'll take heads.
67	00:06:03	00:06:07	Lizzie Borden got an axe and gave her mother 40 whacks.
68	00:06:07	00:06:13	Contrary to the poem, Lizzie Borden gave her parents a total of 29 whacks.
69	00:06:13	00:06:22	In this case, we won't know the number of whacks or the type of weapon that did the whacking until we boil off the flesh and examine the tool marks.
70	00:06:33	00:06:37	He has got symmetrical scars on both palms.
71	00:06:37	00:06:40	That would support the theory that we're dealing with some kind of cult.
72	00:06:40	00:06:41	Bloodletting is a common practice.
73	00:06:41	00:06:42	Abrasions are deep.
74	00:06:42	00:06:44	He struggled.
75	00:06:44	00:06:46	It's a powerful thing, the will to live.
76	00:06:48	00:06:50	Well, so is the will to kill.
77	00:06:50	00:06:54	Looks like more than a dozen chop marks.
78	00:06:57	00:06:59	Whoa.
79	00:06:59	00:07:01	The water's beading.
80	00:07:03	00:07:08	Lotions and massage oils make water run off the skin like this. Yeah.
81	00:07:08	00:07:11	This man has very little body hair.
82	00:07:11	00:07:13	He's been waxed.
83	00:07:13	00:07:17	From head to toe.
84	00:07:17	00:07:19	And... everywhere in-between.
85	00:07:20	00:07:23	Doesn't seem to be any hair regrowth.
86	00:07:23	00:07:25	This was done recently.
87	00:07:31	00:07:34	The thing about wax is...
88	00:07:34	00:07:36	it likes to stick around.
89	00:07:36	00:07:38	I'll get this to Hodges.
90	00:07:38	00:07:40	Hey. I ran our vic's prints through AFIS.
91	00:07:40	00:07:44	He's not in the system, and no one matching his description has been reported missing.
92	00:07:44	00:07:47	Well, if he's a tourist, it could be that no one knows he's gone yet.
93	00:07:47	00:07:52	I got his photo out to all the hotels, so maybe somebody will recognize him.
94	00:07:53	00:07:55	You know, uh, last night... Mm-hmm?
95	00:07:55	00:07:57	was... Really great.
96	00:07:57	00:07:59	We gotta do that more often.
97	00:07:59	00:08:01	Yeah, why don't you move in with me?
98	00:08:01	00:08:03	What did you just say?
99	00:08:06	00:08:08	Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm serious.
100	00:08:08	00:08:10	I'd like to make dinner for you every night.
101	00:08:10	00:08:13	Maybe a little breakfast in bed, if you're good.
102	00:08:13	00:08:14	That sounds nice.
103	00:08:16	00:08:18	I... I'll talk to you later.
104	00:08:18	00:08:20	Yeah.
105	00:08:24	00:08:26	I always imagined Wendy and me moving in together.
106	00:08:26	00:08:28	Cuddling on the couch. Watching the Iron Chef.
107	00:08:28	00:08:30	Battle Garbanzo Bean was our favorite.
108	00:08:30	00:08:32	Do you have something for me?
109	00:08:32	00:08:35	Olive oil, rosemary, and a little lemon juice.
110	00:08:35	00:08:40	Salad dressing. Yeah, you throw in a balsamic, and you have a vinaigrette, but in this case...
111	00:08:40	00:08:45	It's the ingredients in the wax that was used on your victim for his extensive man-scaping.
112	00:08:45	00:08:47	Double ouch.
113	00:08:47	00:08:50	I used to go to the Anubis Spa.
114	00:08:50	00:08:54	They had this sugar-based wax which is similar to what they used in ancient Egypt.
115	00:08:54	00:08:56	So an olive oil-based wax...
116	00:08:56	00:08:59	I'm guessing the Mediterranean Hotel?
117	00:09:00	00:09:05	So the hotel spa confirmed that Michael Wilson had a full-body wax there three days ago.
118	00:09:05	00:09:06	Should be the room up here, huh?
119	00:09:06	00:09:08	Yeah. Yeah, it's right here.
120	00:09:08	00:09:11	Front desk recognized the photograph that Vartann's been shopping around.
121	00:09:11	00:09:15	Said that Wilson came in from San Diego and he's here for some kind of convention. Hmm.
122	00:09:22	00:09:24	Obvious signs of a struggle.
123	00:09:24	00:09:31	It would be pretty hard to take someone out of a hotel room against their will without getting caught on camera, right?
124	00:09:31	00:09:32	I'll pull surveillance.
125	00:09:38	00:09:41	Looks like Mr. Wilson was here for a special occasion.
126	00:09:41	00:09:42	Yeah? (camera clicks)
127	00:09:45	00:09:50	Today and for all eternity-- I dedicate my soul to you.
128	00:09:50	00:09:51	I love you, too, honey.
129	00:09:51	00:09:53	They're wedding vows.
130	00:09:53	00:09:54	He was getting married.
131	00:09:58	00:10:00	Found a yellow contact lens.
132	00:10:00	00:10:02	That's an unusual color.
133	00:10:02	00:10:05	Victim wasn't wearing contacts.
134	00:10:11	00:10:13	Huh.
135	00:10:13	00:10:15	A Celtic love knot.
136	00:10:15	00:10:19	It's where, uh, the expression tying the knot came from, you know. Uh-huh.
137	00:10:19	00:10:22	I got a couple of receipts here.
138	00:10:22	00:10:30	One for flowers, one for a cake, and according to this, they're supposed to be delivered to the Unity Room of this hotel on the seventh.
139	00:10:30	00:10:32	The wedding's today.
140	00:10:49	00:10:51	You wouldn't happen to have any garlic on you, would you?
141	00:10:51	00:10:52	No, I'm fresh out.
142	00:10:52	00:10:54	Ah.
143	00:11:03	00:11:06	I think I'm going to be sick.
144	00:11:06	00:11:07	Julie, we just have a few more questions.
145	00:11:07	00:11:09	Hasn't she been through enough?
146	00:11:09	00:11:10	I'm going to put a stop to this.
147	00:11:10	00:11:12	Your kind clearly have no right to badger her like this.
148	00:11:12	00:11:14	Our kind?
149	00:11:14	00:11:16	Mr. Stewart, a young man has been brutally murdered.
150	00:11:16	00:11:18	We have every right to be here.
151	00:11:18	00:11:20	And as far as I'm concerned, you can drop the act.
152	00:11:20	00:11:25	The act? Miss Crenshaw, when was the last time that you saw your fianc√©?
153	00:11:25	00:11:27	Uh, yesterday afternoon...
154	00:11:27	00:11:28	when we rehearsed the ceremony.
155	00:11:28	00:11:29	So roughly 24 hours ago.
156	00:11:29	00:11:33	They didn't want to see each other before the wedding. It's tradition.
157	00:11:33	00:11:39	We embrace the... the principles and the morals of centuries past.
158	00:11:39	00:11:43	Not like the present, where you drive through a chapel and Elvis will hand you a license.
159	00:11:43	00:11:48	As to Michael's state of mind last night-- did he seem agitated, or... unsettled?
160	00:11:48	00:11:49	No.
161	00:11:49	00:11:52	Michael was about to marry the love of his life.
162	00:11:52	00:11:54	I've never seen anyone so happy.
163	00:11:54	00:11:57	Ethan. You're the best man, right?
164	00:11:57	00:11:58	Right.
165	00:11:58	00:12:00	So you were in charge of the bachelor party?
166	00:12:00	00:12:03	Bachelor party?
167	00:12:03	00:12:06	Yeah, did you guys party like a rap star last night, or what?
168	00:12:06	00:12:08	We simply dined.
169	00:12:08	00:12:11	Then Michael went back to his room to work on his vows and meditate.
170	00:12:11	00:12:12	Vampires meditate?
171	00:12:12	00:12:17	A true vampiric state can only be achieved through discipline and self-control.
172	00:12:17	00:12:20	Self-control wasn't exercised in Michael's hotel room.
173	00:12:20	00:12:22	The place was completely trashed.
174	00:12:22	00:12:24	This is all my fault.
175	00:12:24	00:12:27	I was the one who wanted to get married at the convention.
176	00:12:27	00:12:28	Where they let anyone in.
177	00:12:28	00:12:32	All of our friends were going to be here, anyway.
178	00:12:32	00:12:34	I wanted them to see how happy we were.
179	00:12:34	00:12:38	Let's go back to where they let everyone in. Who's everyone?
180	00:12:38	00:12:40	This is a Covens and Clans convention.
181	00:12:41	00:12:46	Vampires, and... unfortunately werewolves.
182	00:12:46	00:12:48	Mr. Stewart...
183	00:12:48	00:12:51	May I see your hand, please?
184	00:12:52	00:12:53	Huh.
185	00:12:53	00:12:55	Miss Crenshaw?
186	00:12:59	00:13:04	We found the same scar on Michael's palms.
187	00:13:04	00:13:07	In the movies, vampires thirst for blood. Well...
188	00:13:07	00:13:09	we're not sanguinarians.
189	00:13:09	00:13:10	For us, blood is a...
190	00:13:10	00:13:13	a symbol of the life force that flows through us.
191	00:13:13	00:13:18	We shed our blood in ceremonies to bind one another together.
192	00:13:21	00:13:25	Whoever killed Michael put a stake in my heart, too.
193	00:13:28	00:13:32	This has Van Helsing written all over it.
194	00:13:32	00:13:34	The vampire slayer? Mm-hmm.
195	00:13:34	00:13:36	I thought he just staked them through the heart.
196	00:13:36	00:13:38	The staking was just to keep them in their coffins.
197	00:13:38	00:13:41	If you really want to kill a vampire, you have to cut off his head.
198	00:13:41	00:13:44	Only this guy wasn't a real vampire.
199	00:13:44	00:13:46	Well, someone thought so.
200	00:13:46	00:13:53	You know, a few years ago, in Romania, a family dug up their dead relative because they thought he was a vampire.
201	00:13:53	00:13:59	They ripped out his heart, burned it, mixed the ashes with water, and then drank it.
202	00:13:59	00:14:01	Seriously?
203	00:14:01	00:14:09	And, much like you, the Romanian police didn't believe in vampires, so they charged the family with abusing a corpse.
204	00:14:09	00:14:11	Served three years in prison.
205	00:14:11	00:14:14	But the townspeople thought they were heroes.
206	00:14:16	00:14:19	Individual stria match.
207	00:14:19	00:14:22	A single tool made all these cuts.
208	00:14:24	00:14:29	Depth impressions range from one-to-three-eighths of an inch, indicating varying degrees of force.
209	00:14:29	00:14:36	The killer used a curved, heavy-headed blade, most likely an axe or a hatchet.
210	00:14:38	00:14:41	Yeah, okay. Thanks, Arch.
211	00:14:44	00:14:46	Well, so much for our abduction theory.
212	00:14:46	00:14:50	Surveillance confirmed that Michael Wilson left the hotel at midnight by himself.
213	00:14:50	00:14:52	There had to be some kind of altercation.
214	00:14:52	00:14:54	You did see his room.
215	00:14:54	00:14:58	Yeah, whoever started it probably finished it at Mount Charleston.
216	00:14:58	00:15:00	Ah, whoa. (laughs deeply)
217	00:15:00	00:15:01	What do you think?
218	00:15:01	00:15:03	Creepy. Yeah.
219	00:15:03	00:15:04	I do feel powerful.
220	00:15:04	00:15:07	I feel... you know, dangerous. Hmm?
221	00:15:07	00:15:13	I think maybe the reason these people dress up like these creatures is to help them embrace their dark side.
222	00:15:13	00:15:14	Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.
223	00:15:14	00:15:16	You kinda scared me for a minute there. Okay, okay.
224	00:15:16	00:15:20	Same contact lens as the one that we found in Michael Wilson's room.
225	00:15:20	00:15:23	They've sold 500 of these at this convention in the last two days.
226	00:15:23	00:15:25	Well, great. That's impossible to trace.
227	00:15:25	00:15:27	We'd better hope DNA comes through.
228	00:15:27	00:15:29	Yeah.
229	00:15:29	00:15:31	Wow.
230	00:15:31	00:15:34	Cool eyes. Mom!
231	00:15:34	00:15:36	I need your credit card.
232	00:15:36	00:15:38	I think you just turned another one over to the dark side.
233	00:15:41	00:15:43	That's nice... nice...
234	00:15:43	00:15:45	Remember, you're undead.
235	00:15:45	00:15:46	Ow.
236	00:15:47	00:15:53	So you think it's the neck biting, the bloodsucking, or the carnal sex that's the appeal?
237	00:15:53	00:15:55	It's probably all of the above.
238	00:15:55	00:15:56	Once you mate, it's for life.
239	00:15:56	00:15:59	You know, if it's worth, uh, living for...
240	00:16:00	00:16:03	...it's also worth dying for.
241	00:16:05	00:16:06	Wiccans...
242	00:16:06	00:16:13	bring your best spells and potions to the sharing circle, when the hour strikes...
243	00:16:13	00:16:16	Whew! That's quite an arsenal.
244	00:16:16	00:16:19	I didn't realize that vampires and werewolves needed weapons.
245	00:16:19	00:16:22	Oh, they don't. You do.
246	00:16:23	00:16:24	Back to work, honey.
247	00:16:24	00:16:26	Don't flirt with the dogs.
248	00:16:26	00:16:29	It's slay or be slayed out there.
249	00:16:29	00:16:32	So have you ever used one of these weapons to, uh, slay a vampire yourself?
250	00:16:34	00:16:36	If these blades could talk.
251	00:16:36	00:16:39	No, but seriously, can I tell you guys something?
252	00:16:40	00:16:43	I'm a direct descendant of the great Van Helsing.
253	00:16:43	00:16:44	Really?
254	00:16:44	00:16:46	Yeah. So...
255	00:16:46	00:16:48	Ridding the world of monsters is in my blood.
256	00:16:49	00:16:52	I've seen the evil they can do.
257	00:16:52	00:16:55	Killing machines, really. No conscience, no mercy.
258	00:16:55	00:17:00	So what kind of weapon would you recommend to, say, decapitate a vampire?
259	00:17:00	00:17:03	Ooh, I like how you think.
260	00:17:03	00:17:08	I would go with the TransVlad 5000.
261	00:17:08	00:17:10	Top o' the line.
262	00:17:10	00:17:15	Stainless steel, leather-wrapped handle, And how much does that set you back?
263	00:17:15	00:17:18	Well, for you young slayers, I could do...
264	00:17:18	00:17:19	450 bucks.
265	00:17:19	00:17:22	Yeah. Kinda steep. That's a little pricey.
266	00:17:22	00:17:23	Well, why don't you let me slashthe price?!
267	00:17:23	00:17:25	$425, just for today.
268	00:17:25	00:17:30	We were thinking of something more along the lines of the axe or hatchet family?
269	00:17:30	00:17:31	I get it.
270	00:17:31	00:17:33	You guys are on some kind of budget.
271	00:17:33	00:17:35	You're not yanking my chain here.
272	00:17:35	00:17:36	You're not wasting my time?
273	00:17:36	00:17:37	'Cause I might have to...
274	00:17:37	00:17:39	(makes slicing noise) ...decapitate you!
275	00:17:39	00:17:41	I'm just kidding.
276	00:17:41	00:17:42	Honey, can you get me the wood axe?
277	00:17:47	00:17:50	If he doesn't die, he'll-he'll have to get a tetanus shot.
278	00:17:50	00:17:56	No, but seriously, this might do the trick on your entry-level blood junkies, but, uh, no guarantees.
279	00:17:56	00:17:59	And... (makes stabbing noise)... no returns.
280	00:17:59	00:18:04	Heavy head, curved blade about five inches long.
281	00:18:04	00:18:05	How many of these have you sold?
282	00:18:05	00:18:06	None.
283	00:18:06	00:18:10	People usually go for the crossbows, or the... or the scimitars.
284	00:18:10	00:18:13	They don't go for something you could get at Home Depot.
285	00:18:13	00:18:15	We'll take it. We'll take it.
286	00:18:30	00:18:32	Oh, man.
287	00:18:32	00:18:34	Sorry.
288	00:18:34	00:18:37	That's okay, this shirt was begging for it.
289	00:18:37	00:18:38	Recreating the event, I see.
290	00:18:38	00:18:41	Analyzing tool marks and blood spatter.
291	00:18:41	00:18:45	According to Doc Robbins, Michael Wilson was struck no less than 18 times.
292	00:18:45	00:18:46	How many you up to? About 11.
293	00:18:46	00:18:53	I keep trying to hit the same place twice, but every time I miss, I have to start over again, and my hand is killing me.
294	00:18:53	00:18:54	Want to let me give it a whack?
295	00:18:54	00:18:57	All right.
296	00:18:58	00:19:04	You know my PawPaw used to say the great thing about wood once when you chop it, and once when you burn it.
297	00:19:16	00:19:20	That's my five, your 11, that makes 16.
298	00:19:20	00:19:21	I think we shaved a couple off the killer's total.
299	00:19:24	00:19:26	Come take a look at this with me, will you?
300	00:19:35	00:19:37	The victim was struck from all sides.
301	00:19:37	00:19:40	That's very difficult to do with a guy who's chained to a fence.
302	00:19:40	00:19:44	That would mean the killer hopped the fence, so he could take shots from the other side.
303	00:19:57	00:20:02	Why do that? We just proved you can get the job done standing in the same spot.
304	00:20:02	00:20:04	Maybe he didn't know that.
305	00:20:04	00:20:06	There is another possibility.
306	00:20:06	00:20:09	Maybe he wasn't alone.
307	00:20:15	00:20:17	That's a hair we found in your victim's mouth.
308	00:20:17	00:20:19	Scale patterns are mosaic.
309	00:20:19	00:20:21	It's not human.
310	00:20:21	00:20:24	I ran it against this exemplar.
311	00:20:24	00:20:27	Canis lupus.
312	00:20:27	00:20:28	Wolf hair?
313	00:20:28	00:20:30	Or, maybe... werewolf.
314	00:20:30	00:20:33	I have been doing extensive research.
315	00:20:33	00:20:37	According to the legend, vampires enslaved werewolves during the Trajanic War.
316	00:20:37	00:20:40	Werewolves revolted, and they've been mortal enemies ever since.
317	00:20:40	00:20:42	Like Cain and Abel.
318	00:20:42	00:20:44	Romulus and Remus.
319	00:20:44	00:20:45	Tom and Jerry. I get it.
320	00:20:45	00:20:48	There were a lot of werewolves at that convention.
321	00:20:48	00:20:54	But as scientists, we know that wannabe werewolves cannot physically transform themselves into wolves.
322	00:20:54	00:20:56	So, where did this hair come from?
323	00:20:56	00:20:59	Perhaps one of them has a four-legged companion.
324	00:20:59	00:21:01	They say that people look like their dogs.
325	00:21:01	00:21:04	Greg's running canine CODIS right now.
326	00:21:04	00:21:05	Thank you.
327	00:21:05	00:21:12	Um, out of curiosity-- uh, will you and Detective Vartann be sharing your house or his?
328	00:21:12	00:21:13	Really none of your business.
329	00:21:13	00:21:24	I had love in my grasp, and I let it slip through my fingers, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself.
330	00:21:25	00:21:28	It's a terrible thing to wake up to every day.
331	00:21:30	00:21:33	I'll... keep that in mind.
332	00:21:37	00:21:39	Your wolf's in the system.
333	00:21:39	00:21:41	His name's Timber.
334	00:21:41	00:21:42	Hmm, how original.
335	00:21:42	00:21:47	He was entered into canine CODIS two years ago, when his owner assaulted someone in front of the Tangiers.
336	00:21:47	00:21:50	Timber, here, joined in on the fight.
337	00:21:50	00:21:51	Wolves don't normally attack humans.
338	00:21:51	00:21:52	Blame the owner, not the wolf.
339	00:21:52	00:21:54	Who's the owner?
340	00:21:54	00:21:56	Kurt Francis. He's also in the system.
341	00:21:56	00:21:59	Multiple assaults, drunk and disorderly, DUI...
342	00:21:59	00:22:01	He's registered at the convention.
343	00:22:01	00:22:03	He's the leader of a werewolf pack.
344	00:22:03	00:22:06	Well, we're looking for multiple attackers.
345	00:22:06	00:22:08	Wolves do hunt in packs.
346	00:22:08	00:22:10	Maybe werewolves do, too.
347	00:22:10	00:22:13	Get your glasses up. Come on. Come on.
348	00:22:13	00:22:16	Looks like we need another round. Sorry.
349	00:22:16	00:22:18	Who's buying another round?
350	00:22:18	00:22:20	Yo, yo, check her out. (howls)
351	00:22:20	00:22:22	Sorry, guys...
352	00:22:22	00:22:25	That is a nice piece of meat. Mm.
353	00:22:25	00:22:27	You're right, Kurtis. Sweet!
354	00:22:33	00:22:35	How about it, honey? How about a lap dance?
355	00:22:35	00:22:36	Whoa, whoa.
356	00:22:36	00:22:38	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
357	00:22:38	00:22:39	Come on! (indistinct shouts, laughter)
358	00:22:39	00:22:41	No! Get your hands off of me!
359	00:22:41	00:22:43	Come on! Ah!
360	00:22:43	00:22:45	You're hurting me! Get your hands off of her.
361	00:22:45	00:22:47	What do you think you're doing with that stick, old man?
362	00:22:47	00:22:50	Relax, relax, relax. Everybody be cool now.
363	00:22:50	00:22:51	Be cool now, boys.
364	00:22:51	00:22:53	Just relax. Move it along, old man.
365	00:22:53	00:22:55	What is that?
366	00:22:55	00:22:56	Is that wolf hair?
367	00:22:58	00:22:59	Back up!
368	00:22:59	00:23:00	Back up!
369	00:23:01	00:23:03	Back up!
370	00:23:04	00:23:09	The hold I have you in is called a lateral vascular hold.
371	00:23:09	00:23:17	The discomfort you're feeling is my forefinger and thumb constricting your airway, cutting off the oxygen to your brain.
372	00:23:17	00:23:21	(gasping) You should pass out right about...
373	00:23:21	00:23:23	now.
374	00:23:27	00:23:30	Why don't one of you take these chains off of me and give me my vest back?
375	00:23:30	00:23:32	Well, you can't have it back.
376	00:23:32	00:23:39	You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog, and when he died we never once considered turning him into a jacket.
377	00:23:39	00:23:40	Eh, never.
378	00:23:40	00:23:43	Timber was a loyal member of the pack.
379	00:23:43	00:23:45	I wanted to keep him with me.
380	00:23:45	00:23:49	We found some of Timber's hair in the teeth of a murder victim, Michael Wilson.
381	00:23:49	00:23:50	Who?
382	00:23:50	00:23:51	Michael Wilson.
383	00:23:51	00:23:56	He was at your convention-- he was of the vampire persuasion. Well, I don't hang with parasites.
384	00:23:56	00:23:57	Well, you should think about it.
385	00:23:57	00:23:58	I mean, you have a lot in common.
386	00:23:58	00:24:00	You're in the same movies.
387	00:24:00	00:24:04	You know, there's a creature in the Philippines called an aswang.
388	00:24:04	00:24:06	A what? Aswang.
389	00:24:06	00:24:08	It's a half-breed.
390	00:24:08	00:24:09	Half vampire, half werewolf.
391	00:24:09	00:24:13	We are nothing like those bloodsuckers.
392	00:24:13	00:24:16	There's a reason why they hide in the dark, you know?
393	00:24:16	00:24:18	Act like the elite.
394	00:24:18	00:24:20	Pretend to be, uh...
395	00:24:20	00:24:22	refined.
396	00:24:22	00:24:25	You see, us animals...
397	00:24:25	00:24:27	we're honest.
398	00:24:27	00:24:30	We follow our instincts.
399	00:24:30	00:24:32	We give in to our urges.
400	00:24:32	00:24:34	Like the urge to kill.
401	00:24:34	00:24:37	We found a contact lens in Michael Wilson's hotel room.
402	00:24:37	00:24:39	The DNA says it's yours.
403	00:24:41	00:24:42	Kurt.
404	00:24:44	00:24:47	I think you're taking this mortal enemy thing a little too far.
405	00:24:47	00:24:51	Now, where were you two nights ago?
406	00:24:51	00:24:53	I don't remember.
407	00:24:53	00:24:55	There was a full moon, and I shifted.
408	00:24:57	00:25:02	You shifted? When there's a full moon, I'mnot as strong, Ican't control it.
409	00:25:04	00:25:08	Can you remember where you were when the sun came up?
410	00:25:08	00:25:10	I was in my car.
411	00:25:10	00:25:13	Where was your car?
412	00:25:13	00:25:17	Self-park garage at the Mediterranean, level three.
413	00:25:17	00:25:20	Good dog.
414	00:25:22	00:25:23	This car is a gas guzzler.
415	00:25:23	00:25:27	You'd think a wolf would be more environmentally conscious.
416	00:25:29	00:25:31	Oh...
417	00:25:32	00:25:37	I think I know why Kurt Francis couldn't remember what happened last night.
418	00:25:37	00:25:39	That pooch has been hitting the hooch.
419	00:25:39	00:25:44	It's not the moonlight that turns them into a beast, it's the moonshine.
420	00:25:45	00:25:47	Got some dog collars.
421	00:25:50	00:25:52	Similar pattern to the ligature marks.
422	00:25:52	00:25:57	It's probable that Kurt and his pack used these to restrain Michael Wilson.
423	00:25:57	00:26:01	There's spatter on the passenger door.
424	00:26:09	00:26:11	Positive for blood.
425	00:26:11	00:26:16	The truck might have been parked near the fence when they were killing Michael.
426	00:26:18	00:26:21	Well, there's blood in the window well, too.
427	00:26:21	00:26:23	A lot of it.
428	00:26:23	00:26:25	The window must have been open.
429	00:26:25	00:26:30	Then why isn't there any blood inside the truck, on the seats?
430	00:26:30	00:26:32	What is that smell?
431	00:26:32	00:26:36	Vomit. Is that really what we're gonna talk about right now, man? I'm eating.
432	00:26:36	00:26:38	Well, you're always eating.
433	00:26:38	00:26:39	You were saying?
434	00:26:39	00:26:42	The blood on Kurt Francis's truck came back to the vic.
435	00:26:42	00:26:46	But mixed in with it were traces of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid.
436	00:26:46	00:26:48	Digestive enzymes.
437	00:26:48	00:26:52	Yeah, someone drank Michael Wilson's blood and then puked it out the window.
438	00:26:52	00:26:54	Yeah, Kurt Francis. No. It did not come back to Kurt Francis.
439	00:26:57	00:26:59	Of course-- a vampire.
440	00:26:59	00:27:04	If we accept the mythology, werewolves don't drink blood, vampires do.
441	00:27:04	00:27:08	So, what was a vampire doing in Kurt Francis's truck?
442	00:27:08	00:27:10	Don't they hate each other? Mm-hmm.
443	00:27:10	00:27:16	I can't tell you why they were carpooling, but I can tell you that the vampire we're looking for is sick.
444	00:27:16	00:27:21	Hodges found traces of hematin and mesoporphyrin in the vomit.
445	00:27:21	00:27:23	Both of those are used to treat porphyria.
446	00:27:23	00:27:30	It's a blood disorder; it's also known as the vampire disease. Well, you know, we had a case about ten years ago where the killer had porphyria.
447	00:27:30	00:27:34	Remember? She chopped up her victims and turned them into protein shakes.
448	00:27:36	00:27:37	(laughs) I'm sorry, man.
449	00:27:37	00:27:38	(coughs) It's all right.
450	00:27:38	00:27:42	So we're not just looking for a vampire poser.
451	00:27:42	00:27:45	We're looking for a sanguinarian.
452	00:27:49	00:27:53	By sharing our blood with Michael, he takes a part of each of us into the next world.
453	00:27:53	00:27:55	It's one in life, one in death.
454	00:27:55	00:27:56	It's how we honor our dead.
455	00:27:56	00:27:59	Well, may a stranger offer a few words?
456	00:27:59	00:28:00	Uh, no, actually. Thank you.
457	00:28:00	00:28:02	Thank you.
458	00:28:02	00:28:06	Michael lived and died as...
459	00:28:06	00:28:07	a vampire.
460	00:28:07	00:28:09	A being hated for centuries.
461	00:28:09	00:28:14	Hatred is born of fear, fear of things we don't understand.
462	00:28:14	00:28:23	In medieval times, for example, when someone saw a bloated corpse with blood running from its mouth, they believed it was a vampire such as yourselves.
463	00:28:23	00:28:28	Science now teaches us that that's just part of the decomposition process.
464	00:28:28	00:28:33	It's simply gasses purging fluids from the body through the nose and from the mouth.
465	00:28:33	00:28:35	This is highly inappropriate at a memorial service.
466	00:28:35	00:28:37	You know, you're right, Thomas.
467	00:28:37	00:28:39	This is a somber occasion, Dr. Ray.
468	00:28:39	00:28:41	Maybe we should lighten things up a little bit.
469	00:28:41	00:28:42	Maybe we should.
470	00:28:42	00:28:45	What does it say in the Good Book, Nick?
471	00:28:45	00:28:46	Let there be light.
472	00:28:51	00:28:56	Science has a way of revealing other truths about vampires.
473	00:28:56	00:28:59	Like... your acute sensitivity to sunlight.
474	00:28:59	00:29:04	It's actually a symptom of a medical condition called porphyria.
475	00:29:06	00:29:08	Even...
476	00:29:08	00:29:14	brief exposure to sunlight can cause your skin to...
477	00:29:15	00:29:17	...burn...
478	00:29:17	00:29:19	and blister.
479	00:29:20	00:29:25	The great thing about science is that it always sheds light on the subject.
480	00:29:26	00:29:27	I didn't kill Michael.
481	00:29:27	00:29:29	When I found him, he was already dead.
482	00:29:29	00:29:33	So you thought, why let all that good blood go to waste?
483	00:29:33	00:29:37	You know, I take offense to that. You said yourself that your coven doesn't drink blood. No, we don't.
484	00:29:37	00:29:39	I made an exception for Michael.
485	00:29:39	00:29:40	Why?
486	00:29:40	00:29:43	Because I wanted his soul to live on through me.
487	00:29:44	00:29:47	They lured him to the mountain.
488	00:29:47	00:29:51	I tried to get there in time to save him, but I was too late. Yeah? Who's they?
489	00:29:51	00:29:52	Wolves.
490	00:29:52	00:29:55	They had their noses open that night.
491	00:29:55	00:29:58	You know, there's only one problem with your story, Thomas.
492	00:29:58	00:30:06	You hitched a ride back to town with the leader of the wolf pack. The evidence tells us that you and Kurt Francis killed Michael together.
493	00:30:14	00:30:19	See, the thing about drinking human blood is, our bodies lack the enzymes to break it down properly.
494	00:30:19	00:30:20	It induces vomiting.
495	00:30:20	00:30:24	I understand why the werewolves would want Michael dead, but...
496	00:30:24	00:30:26	why would heturn against one of his own?
497	00:30:26	00:30:29	Maybe Michael lost faith.
498	00:30:29	00:30:36	Maybe Michael started to see you a frustrated Web site designer from London.
499	00:30:36	00:30:38	Or maybe it was about the girl.
500	00:30:38	00:30:40	Julie.
501	00:30:40	00:30:43	You wanted her all to yourself, didn't you?
502	00:30:46	00:30:48	I want a lawyer.
503	00:30:50	00:30:54	The yellow contact lens puts Kurt Francis in Michael Wilson's hotel room.
504	00:30:54	00:30:58	Michael's blood in Kurt's car puts him at the crime scene along with Thomas Stewart.
505	00:30:58	00:31:02	But without the murder weapon, we can't prove that either of them killed Michael.
506	00:31:02	00:31:06	Right. Butwhen Nick and I hacked off Jell-O Man's head, we were covered with blood.
507	00:31:06	00:31:08	So if Kurt and Thomas hacked off Michael's head...
508	00:31:08	00:31:10	The clothes should prove it.
509	00:31:10	00:31:11	They should.
510	00:32:02	00:32:05	You know, there should be a lot more blood than this.
511	00:32:05	00:32:07	Could be castoff from simply being at the scene.
512	00:32:07	00:32:10	All it proves is that Kurt and Thomas were there.
513	00:32:10	00:32:12	Well, at the least, they were there.
514	00:32:12	00:32:15	If they only took one or two swings, that could account for the lack of blood.
515	00:32:15	00:32:24	He was hit with an axe at least 18 times, so whether they were just there or they took a couple of swings, it means that someone else took the rest of the swings. Yeah. Yeah, another wolf.
516	00:32:24	00:32:26	Or another vampire.
517	00:32:26	00:32:31	I admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman a certain kind of mysterious allure.
518	00:32:31	00:32:35	There's just one drawback-- it drags along the ground and collects plenty of trace.
519	00:32:35	00:32:38	What did you find, David? Alpine rock butterweed.
520	00:32:38	00:32:43	It's a flowering herb that only grows above 2,500 feet on Mount Charleston along the south loop trail.
521	00:32:43	00:32:46	We didn't find any of this stuff at the crime scene.
522	00:32:46	00:32:49	Makes me wonder what else is up there.
523	00:32:49	00:32:51	We know that Michael was running from his attackers.
524	00:32:51	00:32:54	We know that the chase ended at the fence.
525	00:32:54	00:32:56	Where did it begin?
526	00:33:04	00:33:08	Did you know that a 12-letter word for across the woods is Transylvania?
527	00:33:08	00:33:10	Grissom?
528	00:33:10	00:33:11	Is that you, Grissom?
529	00:33:11	00:33:12	Shut up.
530	00:33:12	00:33:13	Gil?
531	00:33:13	00:33:15	I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him that either.
532	00:33:15	00:33:16	No, you don't think so?
533	00:33:16	00:33:17	I don't.
534	00:33:17	00:33:18	After all this time.
535	00:33:18	00:33:20	That's a shame.
536	00:33:20	00:33:22	All right, here you go.
537	00:33:22	00:33:24	I'll see you at 2,500.
538	00:33:24	00:33:27	If you can keep up.
539	00:33:39	00:33:41	Alpine rock butterweed.
540	00:33:41	00:33:42	Mm-hmm.
541	00:33:50	00:33:54	Big fat tire treads, consistent with Kurt's gas guzzler of a truck.
542	00:33:55	00:33:58	Got something here.
543	00:34:04	00:34:05	Dirt's been disturbed.
544	00:34:16	00:34:19	Another piece.
545	00:34:24	00:34:26	I know this guy.
546	00:34:27	00:34:29	That's Kurt Francis.
547	00:34:36	00:34:38	I can beat that. Yeah?
548	00:34:41	00:34:44	I think somebody tried to bury the hatchet.
549	00:34:47	00:34:51	This photo was taken at last year's convention.
550	00:34:51	00:34:55	Do you recognize the werewolf standing next to Kurt Francis?
551	00:34:57	00:34:59	How about now?
552	00:34:59	00:35:00	Michael Wilson.
553	00:35:00	00:35:04	He was part of Kurt's wolf pack?
554	00:35:04	00:35:05	Looks that way.
555	00:35:05	00:35:16	I think Michael was a wolf who fell for a vampire, but the only way he could have her was to become a vampire himself and hope that nobody recognized him from last year's convention.
556	00:35:16	00:35:19	Well, someone obviously recognized him and that someone was Kurt Francis.
557	00:35:19	00:35:26	He followed Michael to his room, he confronted him, and he got in his face.
558	00:35:26	00:35:28	Once a werewolf, always a werewolf, Michael.
559	00:35:28	00:35:30	We were brothers. You betrayed us for one of them!
560	00:35:34	00:35:42	My guess is that Kurt went looking for Thomas to let him know that there was a traitor in his midst.
561	00:35:42	00:35:47	And for one night and one night only, they joined forces to kill a common enemy.
562	00:35:49	00:35:53	Fluorescein green.
563	00:35:53	00:35:58	Enhances contrast in latent blood.
564	00:35:58	00:35:59	Excellent choice.
565	00:35:59	00:36:02	Thank you.
566	00:36:02	00:36:06	The handle's been wiped clean, but they didn't get all the blood.
567	00:36:06	00:36:08	There's some patterns in the wood.
568	00:36:09	00:36:11	Huh.
569	00:36:14	00:36:17	I think I've seen this before.
570	00:36:22	00:36:25	Look at this.
571	00:36:25	00:36:27	This is the test axe that Nick and I used on Jell-O Man.
572	00:36:27	00:36:28	Hmm.
573	00:36:28	00:36:30	See the pattern?
574	00:36:30	00:36:32	Similar markings.
575	00:36:32	00:36:33	Right. But not the same.
576	00:36:33	00:36:34	They came from this.
577	00:36:34	00:36:39	My, uh, my wedding ring made a pattern in blood on the handle.
578	00:36:39	00:36:43	Kurt Francis wears a ring that has a wolf insignia.
579	00:37:12	00:37:16	That doesn't look like a wolf to me.
580	00:37:21	00:37:23	That's a beautiful engagement ring.
581	00:37:23	00:37:27	Thank you.
582	00:37:27	00:37:32	It's designed to fit your wedding band, yes?
583	00:37:33	00:37:34	May I?
584	00:37:37	00:37:41	And the two halves become one.
585	00:37:43	00:37:46	Michael and I liked the symbolism.
586	00:37:47	00:37:49	The idea that we'd be together forever.
587	00:37:49	00:37:53	Well, we like symbols, too.
588	00:37:53	00:37:58	They have a way of making an impression, especially in blood.
589	00:37:58	00:38:09	When you were swinging that axe at Michael's head again and again, his blood seeped onto the handle of the axe, and your ring left behind an unusual pattern.
590	00:38:09	00:38:13	You got his blood all over you, on your clothes, in your hair.
591	00:38:13	00:38:15	CSIs are searching your hotel room right now.
592	00:38:15	00:38:22	Even if you washed your clothes, even if you took a shower, they'll find evidence of his blood there.
593	00:38:22	00:38:28	Michael never told you that he used to be a werewolf, did he?
594	00:38:31	00:38:33	How did you find out?
595	00:38:36	00:38:42	Thomas told Michael and me to meet him at Mount Charleston for a pre-wedding ritual.
596	00:38:42	00:38:45	As soon as we got there, I knew something was wrong.
597	00:38:52	00:38:56	Thomas ordered Michael to hand over his contacts and his fangs.
598	00:38:59	00:39:00	What are they doing here?
599	00:39:01	00:39:03	Michael?
600	00:39:03	00:39:09	Michael ran and they ran after him, and by the time I caught up, they had chained Michael to a fence.
601	00:39:09	00:39:11	Stop!
602	00:39:11	00:39:12	Let me go!
603	00:39:12	00:39:14	Do something, help him. Show her.
604	00:39:14	00:39:15	Don't, stop!
605	00:39:15	00:39:19	Your beloved used to be a werewolf.
606	00:39:22	00:39:26	Michael said he'd seen me at the convention last year.
607	00:39:28	00:39:31	Said he knew we were destined to be together.
608	00:39:31	00:39:35	So he changed who he was because he loved you.
609	00:39:37	00:39:41	Love built on a lie isn't love.
610	00:39:44	00:39:47	You can't be someone you're not.
611	00:39:49	00:39:51	He wasn't one of us.
612	00:39:51	00:39:54	And that didn't sit well with anyone.
613	00:39:54	00:39:56	Did it?
614	00:39:58	00:39:59	Traitors must die.
615	00:39:59	00:40:00	Julie, I love you.
616	00:40:00	00:40:02	It doesn't matter what side I'm on!
617	00:40:02	00:40:04	He's not on any side.
618	00:40:04	00:40:07	He's not one of us, he's never been one of us, and he's not even one of them.
619	00:40:07	00:40:11	Now, you align yourself to this man, that makes you no better than him.
620	00:40:11	00:40:14	We're all watching, Julie.
621	00:40:14	00:40:16	Choose.
622	00:40:18	00:40:20	Julie.
623	00:40:20	00:40:22	Julie, this is all make-believe.
624	00:40:22	00:40:24	Vampires, werewolves.
625	00:40:24	00:40:26	None of this is real.
626	00:40:26	00:40:30	My love for you-- that's what's real.
627	00:40:30	00:40:33	We can just walk away from all this.
628	00:40:33	00:40:35	Do you really love me?
629	00:40:35	00:40:38	Yes, with all my heart, I love you.
630	00:40:38	00:40:40	That was your mistake.
631	00:40:41	00:40:44	You can't be you and love me.
632	00:40:44	00:40:46	No, stop, don't, no!
633	00:40:52	00:41:00	If you agree to testify against Thomas Stewart and Kurt Francis, you may be able to avoid the death penalty.
634	00:41:03	00:41:06	I killed Michael.
635	00:41:08	00:41:13	Maybe the, uh, werewolf and vampire can work out a peace treaty while they're sharing a cell.
636	00:41:13	00:41:17	And Julie Crenshaw will be spending her honeymoon behind bars.
637	00:41:17	00:41:18	So much for love.
638	00:41:18	00:41:21	Well, there's still hope for the rest of us, I hope.
639	00:41:23	00:41:25	You never did give me an answer.
640	00:41:30	00:41:32	Okay.
641	00:41:32	00:41:37	Look, if you don't want to move in together, you know, I understand.
642	00:41:37	00:41:39	Lou.
643	00:41:42	00:41:49	I think that what we have now is pretty awesome.
644	00:41:49	00:41:50	Mm-hmm.
645	00:41:50	00:41:59	And I just fear that if we were to move in together, we're going to start to argue about who forgot to unload the dishwasher, all kinds of crap like that.
646	00:41:59	00:42:01	Besides, we're both armed.
647	00:42:01	00:42:02	It could end badly.
648	00:42:03	00:42:07	Yeah, but, uh...
649	00:42:07	00:42:10	I'm willing to risk it.
650	00:42:12	00:42:15	I'm not.
651	00:42:17	00:42:21	Can't we just enjoy what we've got now?
652	00:42:23	00:42:25	Yeah.
653	00:42:25	00:42:27	I'll take it.
654	00:42:35	00:42:39	Man, I saw this movie when I was about seven.
655	00:42:39	00:42:40	Freaked me out.
656	00:42:40	00:42:42	Really? Yeah, that particular Nosferatu...
657	00:42:42	00:42:44	just... scared me to death.
658	00:42:46	00:42:53	You know, people invented stories about werewolves and vampires to explain the evil in the world.
659	00:42:53	00:42:57	Couldn't believe that people were capable of such terrible violence.
660	00:42:58	00:43:01	Sometimes I can't even believe it myself.
661	00:43:03	00:43:09	But I suppose if there were no evil in the world, we'd be out of a job.
662	00:43:16	00:43:18	Speak of the devil.
663	00:43:18	00:43:21	Triple homicide at the Tangiers.
664	00:43:26	00:43:29	Let's go hunt some monsters.
