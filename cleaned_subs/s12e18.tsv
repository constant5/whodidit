0	00:00:11	00:00:20	Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join Andrew Milner and Lisa Kravitz in holy matrimony.
1	00:00:20	00:00:23	Marriage is the gift of all gifts.
2	00:00:23	00:00:25	It is the promise of all promises.
3	00:00:25	00:00:38	It is commended to be honorable among all men and should not be entered into lightly, but discretely, reverently, advisedly and solemnly.
4	00:00:39	00:00:44	Into this glorious estate, these two now come to be joined.
5	00:00:44	00:00:47	So if any person here has just cause as to...
6	00:00:47	00:00:49	Everybody up!
7	00:00:49	00:00:52	To the front!
8	00:00:52	00:00:53	Move!
9	00:00:59	00:01:01	God, I love big weddings.
10	00:01:01	00:01:03	Ugh, not me.
11	00:01:03	00:01:07	The minute the invitation comes, my feet hurt from the shoes I'm going to have to wear.
12	00:01:07	00:01:11	Oh, come on, how can you resist the unabashed splendor of a storybook wedding?
13	00:01:12	00:01:15	Hey, Conrad, whatcha got?
14	00:01:15	00:01:20	Two armed assailants in full costume, took all the gifts, cash, wallets, jewelry...
15	00:01:20	00:01:21	Did anybody see how they got away?
16	00:01:21	00:01:26	No, three separate witnesses called in the gunshots but nobody got eyes on the getaway car.
17	00:01:26	00:01:28	Response time? Under five minutes.
18	00:01:28	00:01:30	That's a small window to do your thing.
19	00:01:30	00:01:31	Why are you here?
20	00:01:31	00:01:33	Beg pardon?
21	00:01:33	00:01:36	Well, you're the, uh, undersheriff, you're second in command.
22	00:01:36	00:01:38	Well, I'm here for two reasons.
23	00:01:38	00:01:44	First, as the mayor just reminded me there are 300 weddings a day in Las Vegas, bringing millions of out of town dollars into our economy.
24	00:01:44	00:01:45	What's the second reason?
25	00:01:45	00:01:47	This isn't just a robbery.
26	00:01:47	00:01:48	It's a robbery homicide.
27	00:01:52	00:01:54	Good Lord.
28	00:01:54	00:01:57	So much for your storybook wedding.
29	00:02:37	00:02:39	One bullet hole.
30	00:02:39	00:02:40	No spatter.
31	00:02:40	00:02:42	Must be the only one.
32	00:02:42	00:02:44	Can you lift the head? Yeah.
33	00:02:51	00:02:53	No exit wound. Bullet must still be in there.
34	00:02:53	00:02:55	Hey, guys, there's something missing, right?
35	00:02:55	00:02:57	Isn't there a...
36	00:02:57	00:02:58	Never mind, I found it.
37	00:03:00	00:03:02	Oh, yeah.
38	00:03:02	00:03:06	Gunshot residue on the Mad Hatter's card.
39	00:03:07	00:03:09	Pattern puts it at close range.
40	00:03:09	00:03:15	So the groom was shot execution-style, on his wedding day.
41	00:03:15	00:03:16	What kind of person does that?
42	00:03:16	00:03:19	Maybe somebody who doesn't much care for the institution.
43	00:03:19	00:03:21	I take it from your tone that you don't either.
44	00:03:21	00:03:24	I like weddings; I've had two of them, but...
45	00:03:24	00:03:27	marriages, they don't really agree with me.
46	00:03:35	00:03:38	If you think about it, a wedding's a pretty good place to rob, huh?
47	00:03:38	00:03:41	You'd be the wedding expert, I guess.
48	00:03:41	00:03:43	Your mom's a multiple offender too, you know.
49	00:03:43	00:03:45	But her second one stuck.
50	00:03:47	00:03:49	I noticed you're light next week.
51	00:03:49	00:03:50	You want to grab a bite to eat?
52	00:03:50	00:03:53	Next week's a ways away.
53	00:03:53	00:03:56	We'll see.
54	00:04:06	00:04:10	It was a beautiful day, like a fairy tale.
55	00:04:10	00:04:16	Then, all of the sudden, we hear gunshots, and we all turn and see this smiling cat and this white rabbit.
56	00:04:16	00:04:18	Like in the book?
57	00:04:18	00:04:19	They didn't have guns in the book.
58	00:04:21	00:04:29	Everybody up! NANA Told us to take out our wallets, our phones, our jewelry, they even pulled off my brooch.
59	00:04:29	00:04:32	Well, we'll see what we can do about getting that back for you.
60	00:04:32	00:04:33	I'm sorry.
61	00:04:33	00:04:34	Thank you. All right.
62	00:04:34	00:04:36	They split up as soon as they got in.
63	00:04:36	00:04:38	The rabbit gathered up all the gifts.
64	00:04:38	00:04:39	They just barked out orders.
65	00:04:39	00:04:42	And assured everybody that it would all be over soon.
66	00:04:42	00:04:44	And for a while, it seemed like it would be.
67	00:04:44	00:04:46	Then there was that scuffle. (people arguing)
68	00:04:46	00:04:47	Move!
69	00:04:47	00:04:49	What kind of a scuffle?
70	00:04:49	00:04:50	I don't know, it was on the other side of the crowd.
71	00:04:50	00:04:51	I didn't get a good look.
72	00:04:51	00:04:53	Can you think of anyone that did?
73	00:04:54	00:04:56	Go ask Alice.
74	00:04:57	00:05:08	Andrew and I met in an English class-- Literature of the Absurd, and Alice in Wonderland kind of became our thing, our way of saying I love you.
75	00:05:10	00:05:11	It's stupid. I know.
76	00:05:11	00:05:13	No, no, I think that's very sweet.
77	00:05:13	00:05:25	When he proposed, on the table was a bottle labeled drink me, a cake labeled eat me, and this antique engagement ring labeled marry me.
78	00:05:25	00:05:27	So, when the rabbit came for the ring...
79	00:05:27	00:05:28	I couldn't let go of it.
80	00:05:28	00:05:34	The rabbit got angry and hit me in the leg with the end of his gun. Andrews very protective of me.
81	00:05:34	00:05:38	And he didn't even slow down when there was a gun to his head.
82	00:05:40	00:05:42	He saw me...
83	00:05:42	00:05:44	before the wedding.
84	00:05:44	00:05:46	It's bad luck.
85	00:05:46	00:05:48	Oh, I... I don't know.
86	00:05:48	00:05:49	Ho, ho, ho, hey, listen to me.
87	00:05:49	00:05:51	Listen to me. Listen to me.
88	00:05:51	00:05:54	This was not your fault. This was theirs.
89	00:05:54	00:05:56	Okay?
90	00:05:56	00:05:57	I'm going to be right back.
91	00:05:57	00:06:01	CSI Finley's going to stay with you here, okay?
92	00:06:02	00:06:07	Mrs. Kravitz, can you show me where he hit you with the gun?
93	00:06:15	00:06:16	Find anything interesting?
94	00:06:18	00:06:24	old, new, borrowed, and hey, something blue.
95	00:06:24	00:06:26	What do you think that is?
96	00:06:26	00:06:28	I have no idea.
97	00:06:28	00:06:30	Let's get all this to Mandy.
98	00:06:30	00:06:32	Our two robbers were quick as a bunny.
99	00:06:32	00:06:34	Maybe they got sloppy and left a paw print.
100	00:06:34	00:06:40	Hey... you got anything to calm down our bride inside a little bit?
101	00:06:40	00:06:41	Sure. Go ahead, Kyle.
102	00:06:41	00:06:43	Okay.
103	00:06:43	00:06:45	This is Haloperidol.
104	00:06:45	00:06:46	Five mils should take the edge off.
105	00:06:46	00:06:48	Where is she?
106	00:06:48	00:06:49	Dressing room.
107	00:06:49	00:06:51	Thanks.
108	00:06:51	00:06:55	What part of no do you not understand-- the N or the O?
109	00:06:55	00:06:57	It's an hour of your life.
110	00:06:57	00:06:59	Of lying. About being your girlfriend.
111	00:07:01	00:07:02	No offense.
112	00:07:02	00:07:04	Oh, no, it's okay.
113	00:07:04	00:07:05	None taken. Really.
114	00:07:05	00:07:06	Sorry to interrupt. Don't worry about it.
115	00:07:06	00:07:09	He's just working on his mommy issues.
116	00:07:09	00:07:15	My mother is visiting CSI for the first time before she gets on a plane, with her boyfriend, to go to Italy.
117	00:07:15	00:07:19	And it's possible, well, probable, that I may have mentioned I was dating someone.
118	00:07:19	00:07:21	Someone at work.
119	00:07:21	00:07:23	She's a woman of expectations.
120	00:07:23	00:07:25	The highest of which she reserves for her son.
121	00:07:25	00:07:27	I'm all she has.
122	00:07:27	00:07:28	I don't want to disappoint her.
123	00:07:28	00:07:29	Then tell her the truth.
124	00:07:29	00:07:31	How would that not disappoint her?
125	00:07:31	00:07:35	Mandy, I am desperate. One date, and then she's out of your life.
126	00:07:48	00:07:50	Ah, yes. My favorite part.
127	00:07:50	00:07:51	D.B.
128	00:07:54	00:08:01	Well, the apparent C.O.D. is traumatic brain injury, caused by projectile penetration of the skull.
129	00:08:01	00:08:02	Bullet to the brain.
130	00:08:02	00:08:06	But the X-ray doesn't show what looks like a bullet.
131	00:08:06	00:08:08	What did it show?
132	00:08:08	00:08:15	I'd rather not say till I get a closer look, at the risk of sounding mad as a hatter myself.
133	00:08:15	00:08:18	It certainly doesn't look like a nine mil.
134	00:08:18	00:08:21	No, it is, in fact, a button.
135	00:08:21	00:08:25	How the heck did it get in there?
136	00:08:25	00:08:28	Well, it's roughly the same size as our entry wound.
137	00:08:28	00:08:33	Penetrating trauma to the skull and gray matter is consistent with a gunshot wound.
138	00:08:36	00:08:42	Our victim had a button fired into his head at 400 meters per second.
139	00:08:42	00:08:47	Pretty absurd, but that's the tale his body is telling.
140	00:08:47	00:08:49	Curiouser and curiouser.
141	00:09:29	00:09:33	I ran every bullet, bouquet and tea cup that Morgan brought me.
142	00:09:33	00:09:35	Prints at the scene matched a guest.
143	00:09:35	00:09:37	There's no outliers. But there was one discrepancy.
144	00:09:37	00:09:40	I ran everything through AFIS and there was one set that matched to an Alan Widcom.
145	00:09:40	00:09:42	What's the discrepancy?
146	00:09:42	00:09:48	Well, the name he gave you when you interviewed him was Charles Dodson, who doesn't actually exist. Huh.
147	00:09:48	00:09:51	And Alan Widcom is an ex-convict.
148	00:09:51	00:09:54	Good find, Mandy.
149	00:09:54	00:09:55	Does he look familiar?
150	00:09:55	00:09:57	Maybe.
151	00:09:57	00:09:59	Can I borrow your marker?
152	00:09:59	00:10:01	Thanks.
153	00:10:11	00:10:13	Last time we spoke, you were a caterpillar.
154	00:10:13	00:10:16	Looks like you came out of your cocoon a little more colorful.
155	00:10:16	00:10:18	Another day, another avatar.
156	00:10:19	00:10:21	Elvis is a big cliche these days.
157	00:10:21	00:10:23	And Liberace's all the rage, so...
158	00:10:23	00:10:26	Is, uh, Charles Dodson another avatar?
159	00:10:26	00:10:29	Birth name of Lewis Carroll.
160	00:10:29	00:10:31	Were we supposed to think that was clever?
161	00:10:31	00:10:34	Well, maybe a little.
162	00:10:34	00:10:37	We dug up your real file, Mr. Widcom.
163	00:10:37	00:10:42	Prison records, rap sheet, ending with a count of armed robbery.
164	00:10:42	00:10:47	I waved a wrench in the face of a crooked mechanic to get my car back.
165	00:10:47	00:10:50	It was stupid, yes, but I'm not a thief.
166	00:10:50	00:10:52	Then why the pseudonym?
167	00:10:52	00:11:00	Because the state doesn't allow felons to be ordained ministers for ten years-- way too long to deny my calling.
168	00:11:00	00:11:02	Calling? Is that what it is?
169	00:11:04	00:11:05	Are you married?
170	00:11:05	00:11:08	I am.
171	00:11:08	00:11:11	It's... special.
172	00:11:11	00:11:12	Isn't it?
173	00:11:12	00:11:15	Yes, it is.
174	00:11:19	00:11:21	You want to keep your license?
175	00:11:21	00:11:22	More than anything.
176	00:11:22	00:11:24	Then help us get these guys.
177	00:11:24	00:11:26	In prison, you've seen your share of criminals.
178	00:11:26	00:11:28	Anything at all stand out with these two?
179	00:11:28	00:11:29	Yes.
180	00:11:29	00:11:31	They were very efficient.
181	00:11:31	00:11:34	They locked the right doors, crowd control.
182	00:11:34	00:11:36	Everything was very intentional.
183	00:11:36	00:11:37	Very practiced.
184	00:11:37	00:11:40	This wasn't their first rodeo.
185	00:11:40	00:11:41	No, these guys were pros.
186	00:11:51	00:11:52	So what was your other one like?
187	00:11:52	00:11:54	Your first wedding.
188	00:11:54	00:11:55	Oh.
189	00:11:55	00:11:56	Big affair.
190	00:11:56	00:11:59	Probably dropped 300 G's.
191	00:11:59	00:12:03	It was beautiful, it was grand, but it was missing something.
192	00:12:03	00:12:04	What's that?
193	00:12:04	00:12:05	Love.
194	00:12:05	00:12:07	Oh...
195	00:12:08	00:12:10	Okay. Okay!
196	00:12:13	00:12:15	Hi. Hi.
197	00:12:17	00:12:23	Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today to marry Walter Gersh to...
198	00:12:23	00:12:25	Crystal Hasselbeck.
199	00:12:25	00:12:30	Walter, do you take Crystal to be your lawfully wedded wife?
200	00:12:30	00:12:32	You bet.
201	00:12:34	00:12:36	To have and to... holy...
202	00:12:36	00:12:37	(guns cocking) Babe, what is it?
203	00:12:37	00:12:38	Hands up in the air.
204	00:12:38	00:12:40	Now!
205	00:12:46	00:12:48	The advice from our caterpillar was spot-on.
206	00:12:48	00:12:50	These guys are pros.
207	00:12:50	00:12:51	Look at that.
208	00:12:51	00:12:56	Took the couple down quickly, got all their stuff in no time.
209	00:12:56	00:12:57	Got the car, too.
210	00:12:57	00:13:02	Beelined it right across the street to that service alley.
211	00:13:02	00:13:03	Lucky move.
212	00:13:03	00:13:06	Any longer or in any other direction, we would've gotten them.
213	00:13:06	00:13:08	Please tell me you got something on the SUV.
214	00:13:08	00:13:12	It was stolen about an hour earlier from a mall parking lot.
215	00:13:12	00:13:15	It's official.
216	00:13:15	00:13:18	These two are starting to piss me off.
217	00:13:18	00:13:20	I feel so violated.
218	00:13:20	00:13:24	My purse, my necklace, my engagement ring.
219	00:13:24	00:13:25	Anything else?
220	00:13:25	00:13:27	His wallet and watch.
221	00:13:27	00:13:29	Uh, don't forget the car.
222	00:13:29	00:13:31	Well, yeah, but it's just a car.
223	00:13:31	00:13:33	It's a Rolls Royce Corniche.
224	00:13:33	00:13:34	It was custom; it had everything.
225	00:13:34	00:13:36	Well, great. So, uh, you had LoJack?
226	00:13:36	00:13:37	Of course not.
227	00:13:37	00:13:41	Think I want the government tracking me?
228	00:13:41	00:13:44	Uh, did you see any faces?
229	00:13:44	00:13:46	Scars? Tattoos?
230	00:13:46	00:13:48	Hear any voices?
231	00:13:48	00:13:49	The one on my side talked.
232	00:13:49	00:13:52	Uh, he had a deep voice, but it was muffled.
233	00:13:52	00:13:53	Okay.
234	00:13:53	00:13:57	Um, the ring... approximate value?
235	00:13:57	00:14:00	You can't put a price on love.
236	00:14:00	00:14:03	A little over half a million.
237	00:14:03	00:14:04	That's a lot of love.
238	00:14:04	00:14:07	Only the best.
239	00:14:07	00:14:09	Anything else lost or damaged?
240	00:14:09	00:14:10	They tore his jacket.
241	00:14:10	00:14:13	Oh.
242	00:14:13	00:14:15	And stained my dress.
243	00:14:15	00:14:17	Which is an original.
244	00:14:17	00:14:22	I know it's not technically your wedding night, but, uh...
245	00:14:22	00:14:24	I'm going to need you to take off your clothes.
246	00:14:29	00:14:32	Gotta love a man in uniform.
247	00:14:35	00:14:36	Look at you.
248	00:14:37	00:14:39	Like a real doctor.
249	00:14:39	00:14:41	Mother.
250	00:14:41	00:14:42	You're here, now.
251	00:14:42	00:14:45	Well, I told you I was coming eventually.
252	00:14:45	00:14:49	Besides, I am dying to meet her.
253	00:14:49	00:14:53	Actually, they're very particular about who they allow access to in the lab.
254	00:14:53	00:14:54	She's all taken care of.
255	00:14:54	00:14:56	I got her a full-access badge.
256	00:14:56	00:14:58	Thank you, Mandy.
257	00:14:58	00:15:03	I am just so happy that you found someone, David.
258	00:15:03	00:15:05	Um, funny story.
259	00:15:05	00:15:06	Hilarious, really.
260	00:15:06	00:15:15	I was beginning to worry that I had held onto you too tight after your father left and didn't give you enough space to become your own man.
261	00:15:15	00:15:17	I'm my own man.
262	00:15:17	00:15:18	Look. Lab coat.
263	00:15:18	00:15:20	My own office.
264	00:15:20	00:15:25	I expected it to be a little bigger, given how important you are around here.
265	00:15:25	00:15:29	Mother, I-I think we need to talk.
266	00:15:29	00:15:30	Hi, sweetie.
267	00:15:30	00:15:32	Hey, you.
268	00:15:32	00:15:33	You must be Mrs. Hodges.
269	00:15:33	00:15:35	I'm Morgan Brody.
270	00:15:35	00:15:37	I'm so excited to finally meet you.
271	00:15:37	00:15:39	Oh! Well, call me Olivia.
272	00:15:41	00:15:43	Crazy day at the office, Olivia.
273	00:15:45	00:15:48	I just came by to see if you got trace on the dress.
274	00:15:48	00:15:55	Yes. Uh, I was able to isolate sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, everlace enzyme and potassium monoperchlorate.
275	00:15:55	00:15:57	You put them all together and that gives you...
276	00:15:57	00:15:58	Denture cleaner.
277	00:15:58	00:15:59	You finish each other's sentences.
278	00:15:59	00:16:01	That's adorable.
279	00:16:01	00:16:03	Why denture cleaner?
280	00:16:03	00:16:06	Hazards of dating a septuagenarian?
281	00:16:06	00:16:08	Mm. Right.
282	00:16:10	00:16:12	I wish I had more time to chat.
283	00:16:12	00:16:13	I just, I gotta go.
284	00:16:13	00:16:14	Have a great trip.
285	00:16:14	00:16:16	Thank you.
286	00:16:16	00:16:18	Bye... David.
287	00:16:18	00:16:21	Bye.
288	00:16:21	00:16:23	Bye.
289	00:16:23	00:16:25	Bye. Bye.
290	00:16:25	00:16:26	Love her.
291	00:16:26	00:16:27	Uh, me, too.
292	00:16:27	00:16:29	C-Clearly.
293	00:16:35	00:16:36	Hey.
294	00:16:36	00:16:38	Hey. Good. Come here.
295	00:16:38	00:16:41	I think I finally figured out the mystery of the button in the brain.
296	00:16:41	00:16:42	Great.
297	00:16:42	00:16:45	The gun bruise on our Alice's leg Yeah?
298	00:16:45	00:16:46	matches to this...
299	00:16:46	00:16:52	this World War II gun, which corresponds to casings that Morgan found at the scene.
300	00:16:52	00:16:53	Right? Like this one right here.
301	00:16:53	00:16:54	Nine-mil.
302	00:16:54	00:17:00	She also found an overpowder wad, that fit in here like this.
303	00:17:00	00:17:02	Keep the powder in, because...
304	00:17:02	00:17:03	They were using blanks.
305	00:17:03	00:17:11	No projectile, but you get the same amount of force as your everyday 400- meter-per-second bullet.
306	00:17:11	00:17:18	Now, that force usually comes out in the form of a loud but harmless muzzle flash.
307	00:17:18	00:17:21	Unless the barrel is obstructed...
308	00:17:21	00:17:22	By a button.
309	00:17:22	00:17:23	Fire in the hole!
310	00:17:31	00:17:33	Projectile by proxy.
311	00:17:33	00:17:37	Okay, so we have the how, now we need the who.
312	00:17:37	00:17:40	Same rifle showed up in the drive-thru video.
313	00:17:40	00:17:42	So we've connected the gun to both scenes, right?
314	00:17:42	00:17:45	Mm-hmm. So it's safe to assume that it's the same twosome.
315	00:17:45	00:17:47	Yeah. Same M.O., generally.
316	00:17:47	00:17:50	Armed, disguised, wedding hits.
317	00:17:50	00:17:52	But the two targets couldn't be more different.
318	00:17:52	00:17:55	Wonderland was, like, this grand scheme, right?
319	00:17:55	00:17:56	Carefully planned.
320	00:17:56	00:17:58	Drive-thru was smaller.
321	00:17:58	00:18:00	More spur of the moment.
322	00:18:00	00:18:01	So, think.
323	00:18:01	00:18:03	What's the common denominator?
324	00:18:03	00:18:05	The ring.
325	00:18:09	00:18:10	Hi.
326	00:18:10	00:18:11	Do you have an appointment?
327	00:18:11	00:18:13	We're on the list.
328	00:18:13	00:18:14	Thank you.
329	00:18:17	00:18:20	Are you two together?
330	00:18:20	00:18:21	Yes, we are.
331	00:18:21	00:18:22	We're from the crime lab.
332	00:18:22	00:18:24	Do you recognize these two people?
333	00:18:24	00:18:28	Insurance tells us that they were here buying a ring a while back.
334	00:18:28	00:18:30	Yes, of course.
335	00:18:30	00:18:31	Hard to forget.
336	00:18:31	00:18:32	Because of the age difference?
337	00:18:32	00:18:33	Age difference?
338	00:18:33	00:18:35	This is Las Vegas.
339	00:18:35	00:18:36	I'm talking about the ring.
340	00:18:36	00:18:38	For starters, it's a Gartreau.
341	00:18:39	00:18:41	Gordon Gartreau.
342	00:18:41	00:18:44	Designs ten rings a year, using the finest gold.
343	00:18:44	00:18:45	Non-conflict diamonds.
344	00:18:45	00:18:47	Well, this diamond found a conflict.
345	00:18:47	00:18:50	Armed robbery, last night.
346	00:18:50	00:18:53	So if we stole a ring like that, how would we go about reselling it?
347	00:18:53	00:18:54	You wouldn't.
348	00:18:54	00:18:55	It's one of a kind.
349	00:18:55	00:18:56	Distinct.
350	00:18:56	00:19:01	Well, that would be kind of hard for your average thief to fence it and make any kind of profit.
351	00:19:01	00:19:04	Too high-profile to sell at auction.
352	00:19:04	00:19:06	So what are we looking at here?
353	00:19:06	00:19:07	Thank you, thank you.
354	00:19:07	00:19:09	Sorry we wasted your time.
355	00:19:09	00:19:10	Uh, just one more thing.
356	00:19:10	00:19:15	The woman that bought that ring, she's been here before.
357	00:19:16	00:19:18	A few times.
358	00:19:26	00:19:28	Do you recognize any of these?
359	00:19:28	00:19:31	Yes.
360	00:19:31	00:19:34	I think these rings were all mine, at one time or another.
361	00:19:34	00:19:37	And at this time, where are they?
362	00:19:37	00:19:41	This one I sold.
363	00:19:41	00:19:43	This one I lost.
364	00:19:43	00:19:45	And you know this one was stolen.
365	00:19:45	00:19:47	You insured it.
366	00:19:47	00:19:48	Immediately after buying it.
367	00:19:48	00:19:49	Is that right?
368	00:19:49	00:19:51	That's when you get things insured.
369	00:19:51	00:19:53	Is getting engaged a crime now?
370	00:19:53	00:19:54	No.
371	00:19:54	00:19:57	But fraud is.
372	00:19:57	00:20:01	You declared its value at $1.1 million.
373	00:20:01	00:20:04	That's twice what your fiancé told me it was worth.
374	00:20:04	00:20:08	And this one that you lost, sold online to some guy in Jersey.
375	00:20:08	00:20:11	His receiving account points to you.
376	00:20:14	00:20:18	The first time was a bad breakup, so I kept the ring.
377	00:20:18	00:20:20	The second time was easier.
378	00:20:20	00:20:22	More of a business transaction.
379	00:20:24	00:20:26	Times are tough.
380	00:20:26	00:20:27	And love...
381	00:20:27	00:20:29	Is what, recession-proof?
382	00:20:31	00:20:33	Did you set up this robbery?
383	00:20:33	00:20:34	No, I didn't.
384	00:20:34	00:20:35	I swear.
385	00:20:35	00:20:37	I would never put Walt in danger.
386	00:20:37	00:20:40	But you had no problem setting him up to buy you an expensive ring.
387	00:20:41	00:20:47	At first... yeah.
388	00:20:47	00:20:57	But then, when we were pulling up, I realized, well, I really wanted to marry him.
389	00:20:57	00:20:59	Be married to him.
390	00:20:59	00:21:02	Why should I believe you?
391	00:21:02	00:21:05	I don't know.
392	00:21:05	00:21:07	But you have to believe in love, right?
393	00:21:10	00:21:13	You are the greatest.
394	00:21:13	00:21:15	Glad I could help.
395	00:21:15	00:21:16	Mom off to Italy?
396	00:21:16	00:21:18	Well, uh, good news and bad news.
397	00:21:18	00:21:20	Her boyfriend's flight was delayed.
398	00:21:20	00:21:21	Oh, hope that's the bad news.
399	00:21:21	00:21:26	Yeah, and since she's available, she wanted to have brunch with me and you.
400	00:21:26	00:21:28	Oh. That is bad news.
401	00:21:28	00:21:30	Oh, that's not the bad news.
402	00:21:30	00:21:33	She also wants your father to join us.
403	00:21:35	00:21:43	The last time I had a meal with my father was 14 years ago, when he tried to explain divorce over a milkshake.
404	00:21:43	00:21:44	You don't expect me to call him up for this?
405	00:21:44	00:21:47	No, no, no, no, y-you don't have to.
406	00:21:47	00:21:49	Mother made me call him.
407	00:21:49	00:21:51	And he's very excited.
408	00:21:51	00:21:53	Albeit a little confused.
409	00:21:53	00:21:55	Yeah, he's not the only one.
410	00:21:55	00:21:56	You saw her face.
411	00:21:56	00:21:58	The way that she lit up when she saw you.
412	00:21:58	00:22:00	Sh-She was happy.
413	00:22:02	00:22:03	Proud.
414	00:22:03	00:22:05	Please?
415	00:22:05	00:22:07	I'll do anything you ask.
416	00:22:09	00:22:10	All my cases.
417	00:22:10	00:22:12	Front of the trace line.
418	00:22:12	00:22:14	For a year.
419	00:22:14	00:22:16	You're the greatest.
420	00:22:25	00:22:27	Ooh. Sweet ride.
421	00:22:27	00:22:28	The sweetest.
422	00:22:28	00:22:30	Custom everything.
423	00:22:30	00:22:31	Where'd they find it?
424	00:22:31	00:22:33	D Street and Hudgins.
425	00:22:33	00:22:35	Sticking out like a sore thumb, pre-pillaged.
426	00:22:38	00:22:40	Got something here.
427	00:22:44	00:22:45	Fabric.
428	00:22:48	00:22:50	It's polyester.
429	00:22:52	00:22:55	And they didn't take the high-end sound system.
430	00:22:55	00:22:57	That's worth what, a couple grand on the street?
431	00:22:57	00:22:58	Easy.
432	00:22:58	00:23:00	So what did they take?
433	00:23:00	00:23:03	I noticed the hood ornament.
434	00:23:03	00:23:07	And the... whatever these emblem things were.
435	00:23:07	00:23:09	They're on the steering wheel, too.
436	00:23:11	00:23:13	And the glove compartment.
437	00:23:13	00:23:15	Why these and not the radio?
438	00:23:15	00:23:18	I think...
439	00:23:18	00:23:20	that they were gold.
440	00:23:20	00:23:21	I got filings.
441	00:23:21	00:23:26	I bet they wanted to make sure that they were solid and not plated.
442	00:23:26	00:23:30	Yeah, but wouldn't filing them make them less valuable and harder to sell?
443	00:23:30	00:23:32	Russell said the ring was one of a kind.
444	00:23:32	00:23:33	That's hard to sell, too.
445	00:23:33	00:23:36	So maybe they're not stealing the gold to resell it.
446	00:23:36	00:23:38	Maybe they're melting it down.
447	00:23:38	00:23:42	So where do you go to melt stolen gold in Vegas?
448	00:23:42	00:23:46	Had all my detectives reach out to informants in the stolen jewelry trade.
449	00:23:46	00:23:48	Several pointed to a Fredrick Ladd.
450	00:23:48	00:23:50	Runs a cash-for-gold store in some nearby strip mall.
451	00:23:50	00:23:52	Yeah, like the ads.
452	00:23:52	00:23:54	Market crash. Cold, hard cash.
453	00:23:54	00:23:56	Seriously, you watch too much TV.
454	00:23:56	00:23:59	I work the night shift, and my husband's living abroad.
455	00:23:59	00:24:00	Cut me some slack, please.
456	00:24:02	00:24:04	Anyway, knocked on the door.
457	00:24:04	00:24:05	No answer.
458	00:24:05	00:24:07	Strange burning smell.
459	00:24:07	00:24:08	Unis found him dead.
460	00:24:08	00:24:10	Gold poured down his throat.
461	00:24:10	00:24:13	Looks like it's connected to the Wonderland Robbery.
462	00:24:13	00:24:15	How can you be sure? Educated guess.
463	00:24:28	00:24:30	Hey. What do you got?
464	00:24:30	00:24:35	Looks like our victim was a modern-day alchemist, turning stolen jewelry into untraceable gold.
465	00:24:35	00:24:38	Yeah, because our job isn't hard enough, right?
466	00:24:38	00:24:40	What's all this stuff?
467	00:24:40	00:24:42	All that doesn't glitter-- separated before the melt.
468	00:24:42	00:24:43	Nana of the bride had a dragonfly brooch.
469	00:24:43	00:24:45	It was torn from her blazer.
470	00:24:45	00:24:51	The brooch is here. The gems are here. Empty wallet belonging to the driver of the Rolls-Royce.
471	00:24:51	00:24:54	This is like a land of smoking guns.
472	00:24:54	00:24:58	It looks like the feline was in mid-melt when somebody turned up the heat.
473	00:25:06	00:25:09	Looks like the cast iron's our murder weapon.
474	00:25:09	00:25:10	What is that on the handle?
475	00:25:10	00:25:13	I don't know.
476	00:25:13	00:25:15	So why kill somebody like this?
477	00:25:15	00:25:17	What are they doing, sending a message?
478	00:25:17	00:25:19	We were looking for two robbers.
479	00:25:19	00:25:22	Maybe the partnership hit a rough patch.
480	00:25:22	00:25:24	Maybe.
481	00:25:26	00:25:28	Hey, Doc.
482	00:25:28	00:25:30	How goes it?
483	00:25:30	00:25:31	I'll tell you this-- I'm not bored.
484	00:25:31	00:25:33	Confirm cause of death yet?
485	00:25:33	00:25:35	Thermal injuries.
486	00:25:35	00:25:38	He was alive when the gold was poured down his throat.
487	00:25:38	00:25:40	Cooked him from the inside.
488	00:25:40	00:25:43	Gold melts at 1,850 degrees Fahrenheit.
489	00:25:44	00:25:47	Soft tissue didn't stand a chance.
490	00:25:53	00:25:55	So what's with the XRF?
491	00:25:55	00:25:57	I want to test this guy's metal.
492	00:25:57	00:26:04	If you're so into gold that you pry it off a poor bride's finger, why would you waste it by pouring it down your partner's gullet?
493	00:26:04	00:26:06	I figured it was heat of the moment.
494	00:26:06	00:26:09	Those two seemed like they were as cool as the center seed of a cucumber.
495	00:26:09	00:26:11	A little out of character, don't you think?
496	00:26:16	00:26:17	Iron pyrite.
497	00:26:17	00:26:18	Fool's gold.
498	00:26:18	00:26:20	We're the only fools around here.
499	00:26:20	00:26:22	I mean, he's not our Cheshire cat.
500	00:26:22	00:26:25	Yeah, but why would they set it up to look like a busted partnership?
501	00:26:25	00:26:30	Exactly. You know, they should be halfway to China by now, but they stop and they do this?
502	00:26:30	00:26:33	Only one reason I can think of to go to that much trouble.
503	00:26:33	00:26:35	And what's that?
504	00:26:35	00:26:37	They're planning another job.
505	00:26:43	00:26:45	I'm sorry about this.
506	00:26:45	00:26:48	I-I was really just trying to do a favor for Hodges, and he...
507	00:26:48	00:26:51	Is an irrepressible, but ridiculous human being?
508	00:26:51	00:26:53	Yeah, that.
509	00:26:53	00:26:56	Sorry.
510	00:26:56	00:26:58	No, don't be. It's a... it's a nice thing you're doing for him.
511	00:26:58	00:27:02	And as good an excuse as any for us to finally catch up.
512	00:27:06	00:27:10	You fold your napkin just like your mom.
513	00:27:10	00:27:13	You used to do that when we went to Choozy's Chicken. Do you remember?
514	00:27:17	00:27:19	How's she doing? She okay?
515	00:27:19	00:27:22	Yeah, she's doing great.
516	00:27:22	00:27:24	Jerry, he's, uh... he's good to her?
517	00:27:24	00:27:25	Kind?
518	00:27:25	00:27:26	Oh, yeah.
519	00:27:26	00:27:28	She practically owns him.
520	00:27:28	00:27:30	Well, that sounds about right.
521	00:27:30	00:27:32	Well...
522	00:27:34	00:27:36	I'm happy she's happy.
523	00:27:37	00:27:39	Yeah.
524	00:27:39	00:27:41	I know you are.
525	00:27:42	00:27:43	Hi.
526	00:27:43	00:27:45	Hi. Good to see you again.
527	00:27:45	00:27:47	Hello.
528	00:27:47	00:27:49	Hi. That's where Morgan gets her looks.
529	00:27:49	00:27:50	Oh. (chuckles)
530	00:27:50	00:27:51	Olivia Hodges.
531	00:27:51	00:27:53	Conrad Ecklie.
532	00:27:53	00:27:54	My pleasure. Well...
533	00:27:54	00:27:57	Here we are. Yeah.
534	00:27:57	00:27:58	This is nice.
535	00:27:58	00:28:00	Maybe we should order champagne?
536	00:28:00	00:28:01	Celebrate?
537	00:28:01	00:28:02	Oh?
538	00:28:02	00:28:06	What's the occasion exactly?
539	00:28:06	00:28:07	Young love.
540	00:28:07	00:28:11	David is my only child.
541	00:28:11	00:28:13	Handsome, clearly; charming.
542	00:28:13	00:28:15	But he's had a bit of a dry spell.
543	00:28:15	00:28:17	Mother! What?
544	00:28:17	00:28:19	It's a natural parental concern.
545	00:28:19	00:28:21	Back me up here, Conrad.
546	00:28:21	00:28:28	Well, I'd, uh... I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fantasies about walking Morgan down the aisle.
547	00:28:28	00:28:30	Someday.
548	00:28:31	00:28:34	So tell me-- how did you two meet?
549	00:28:35	00:28:36	Uh...
550	00:28:36	00:28:37	You. I'll take it.
551	00:28:37	00:28:39	Yeah.
552	00:28:39	00:28:40	Well, um...
553	00:28:40	00:28:50	I was called down to L.A. on the trail of this sinister man called the Dick and Jane Killer, and Morgan was assisting on the case.
554	00:28:50	00:28:56	And when the smoke cleared, the only thing left was this pent-up...
555	00:28:56	00:28:59	cross-jurisdictional sexual tension...
556	00:28:59	00:29:02	I'm going to hit the restroom real quick.
557	00:29:02	00:29:04	Great. I'll join you.
558	00:29:09	00:29:11	So...
559	00:29:11	00:29:15	David, your mom-- is, uh...
560	00:29:15	00:29:16	is-is she... She has a boyfriend.
561	00:29:16	00:29:18	He's a count.
562	00:29:18	00:29:20	They're going to Italy together.
563	00:29:23	00:29:26	What, are you working out your commute?
564	00:29:27	00:29:29	Hell, no. I gave up on that years ago.
565	00:29:29	00:29:32	I'm trying to figure out how these wedding robbers got away clean.
566	00:29:32	00:29:34	From which robbery?
567	00:29:34	00:29:35	From both of them.
568	00:29:35	00:29:41	When they took off from the drive-thru, they headed east into oncoming traffic and got away by the skin of their teeth.
569	00:29:41	00:29:47	Now, it seemed like dumb luck, but if you look at the map on the left-- that green square is the chapel, okay?
570	00:29:47	00:29:50	Gotcha. And the red square is where we found the Rolls Royce.
571	00:29:50	00:29:57	Yeah, yeah, and radio cars saturated the area between, but nobody saw two people in gas masks in a high-end ride.
572	00:29:57	00:29:59	They're not lucky; they're good.
573	00:29:59	00:30:03	Exactly. They pulled the same disappearing act when they robbed the Wonderland wedding.
574	00:30:03	00:30:08	So the map on the right-- I reverse-engineered it from the dispatch tapes.
575	00:30:08	00:30:10	Now, in this case, the net was even tighter.
576	00:30:10	00:30:12	Five radio cars and an eye in the sky.
577	00:30:12	00:30:13	And no one saw the getaway car?
578	00:30:13	00:30:14	No. No.
579	00:30:14	00:30:16	And all the main roads were blocked off.
580	00:30:16	00:30:20	You know, I think maybe our bad guys know some shortcuts.
581	00:30:20	00:30:23	We could look at cab drivers, high-end liveries, limousines.
582	00:30:23	00:30:24	Yeah.
583	00:30:24	00:30:26	That's a good idea.
584	00:30:33	00:30:35	You're still here?
585	00:30:35	00:30:36	Yeah.
586	00:30:36	00:30:39	You know, you should really go home and get some rest.
587	00:30:39	00:30:42	I can't stop thinking of my wife.
588	00:30:42	00:30:46	Supposed to be the best day of your life, and-and your soul mate is killed right in front of you.
589	00:30:46	00:30:48	You imagine that? No.
590	00:30:48	00:30:50	I never got a chance to marry my soul mate.
591	00:30:52	00:30:53	Come here. Come here.
592	00:30:53	00:30:55	Let me...
593	00:30:55	00:30:56	Let me just show you something here.
594	00:30:56	00:30:59	Uh, Liberace Caterpillar guy, right, he said that...
595	00:30:59	00:31:01	that those two were practiced?
596	00:31:01	00:31:04	Well, I think I finally figured out where they got their practice.
597	00:31:04	00:31:05	New York City.
598	00:31:05	00:31:08	Three years ago, three wedding robberies.
599	00:31:08	00:31:10	And then I couldn't find any more.
600	00:31:10	00:31:12	Until... Chicago, last year.
601	00:31:12	00:31:13	Yeah. Three wedding robberies.
602	00:31:13	00:31:15	Bing, bang, boom. Okay, look at this.
603	00:31:15	00:31:18	It's not just three in a row.
604	00:31:18	00:31:21	It's three robberies on three consecutive days.
605	00:31:21	00:31:24	New York-- Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
606	00:31:24	00:31:26	Chicago-- Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
607	00:31:26	00:31:28	Las Vegas.
608	00:31:28	00:31:29	Friday was Wonderland.
609	00:31:29	00:31:32	Saturday... The drive-through.
610	00:31:32	00:31:34	Right, so today, Sunday.
611	00:31:34	00:31:37	So that means their hit has to be today.
612	00:31:37	00:31:39	There are hundreds of weddings going on today.
613	00:31:39	00:31:41	We got to narrow it down.
614	00:31:41	00:31:45	We have reason to believe that these wedding robbers are due for one more hit by day's end.
615	00:31:45	00:31:47	Okay, we got three teams.
616	00:31:47	00:31:50	Team A, with Finn, going to the chapel on top of the Palermo.
617	00:31:50	00:31:54	I'm with Sanders, hitting the black-tie affair at the Mediterranean with Team Bravo.
618	00:31:54	00:31:57	Sara and I are headed to Temple Beth El.
619	00:31:57	00:32:02	All right, we got one more chance to get these guys, then they disappear.
620	00:32:02	00:32:03	Good luck, everybody.
621	00:32:15	00:32:17	Hey. Hey.
622	00:32:17	00:32:19	Hodges around?
623	00:32:19	00:32:21	Oh, his mom dragged him out of the lab.
624	00:32:21	00:32:22	Ah.
625	00:32:22	00:32:24	Uh, do you know if he got trace on the cast iron?
626	00:32:24	00:32:25	He did.
627	00:32:25	00:32:29	That latex there was next to the seared flesh here.
628	00:32:29	00:32:36	Which got me thinking-- latex could be a glove, and maybe the charred skin is a finger.
629	00:32:36	00:32:38	Can you get a print off that?
630	00:32:38	00:32:40	Well, I better at least get a partial.
631	00:32:44	00:32:47	Or a partial of a partial.
632	00:32:47	00:32:49	Minimal ridge detail.
633	00:32:49	00:32:53	And it matches about... almost 4,000 prints on AFIS.
634	00:32:53	00:32:55	Latex glove.
635	00:32:55	00:32:58	Polyester from the car, Maybe a uniform.
636	00:32:58	00:33:01	Is there a database for ambulance drivers?
637	00:33:01	00:33:04	Yeah, there's a National Paramedics Registry.
638	00:33:04	00:33:07	Nick said something about how the robbers really knew all of the roads.
639	00:33:09	00:33:11	Pay dirt. Kyle Hartley, paramedic EMT.
640	00:33:11	00:33:13	I know him.
641	00:33:13	00:33:15	He was at the first crime scene.
642	00:33:15	00:33:17	That's how they got away so clean.
643	00:33:17	00:33:20	No one notices an ambulance. And they certainly don't blink when you run a red light.
644	00:33:20	00:33:21	They just get out of the way for you.
645	00:33:21	00:33:24	He moved here eight months ago from Chicago.
646	00:33:24	00:33:25	He has no criminal record.
647	00:33:25	00:33:26	He's married.
648	00:33:26	00:33:30	And look who he's married to.
649	00:33:31	00:33:32	Come on.
650	00:33:32	00:33:34	We're just looking.
651	00:33:34	00:33:37	Mother, I feel that this is a bit presumptuous.
652	00:33:37	00:33:39	You don't let a keeper like Morgan get away.
653	00:33:39	00:33:42	Now, your co-worker Mandy said that this was the place.
654	00:33:42	00:33:43	Hello. Can I help you?
655	00:33:43	00:33:50	Yes. My son, a big deal over at the Las Vegas Police Crime Lab, would like to purchase a ring.
656	00:33:51	00:33:54	Huh, look at that. Denture cleaner.
657	00:33:54	00:33:56	We use it to de-oxydize the metals.
658	00:33:56	00:33:58	Gives it a real shine.
659	00:33:58	00:34:00	That's funny. I was just...
660	00:34:03	00:34:05	You were just what?
661	00:34:05	00:34:09	I was just... nothing. Mother, come on.
662	00:34:09	00:34:10	We're leaving.
663	00:34:12	00:34:14	Yeah, I don't think you are.
664	00:34:16	00:34:18	David, what's happening?
665	00:34:18	00:34:21	I believe we've just found our wedding thieves.
666	00:34:21	00:34:24	But don't worry, Mother. Okay.
667	00:34:24	00:34:26	I know for a fact they only shoot blanks.
668	00:34:30	00:34:31	Oh!
669	00:34:31	00:34:32	Not anymore.
670	00:34:46	00:34:49	Clear? OFFICER 2 You okay?
671	00:34:49	00:34:51	Do I look okay?
672	00:34:51	00:34:53	Someone call the paramedics.
673	00:34:53	00:34:55	Gunshot wound. They blindsided me, Emily and her husband.
674	00:34:55	00:34:56	How long ago did they leave?
675	00:34:56	00:34:58	Four or five minutes ago.
676	00:34:58	00:35:02	They had me disable the surveillance and the alarm, and they cleaned the place out and took off.
677	00:35:02	00:35:03	Listen to me-- one of our guys was headed here.
678	00:35:03	00:35:05	Did you see him?
679	00:35:05	00:35:06	Crime lab guy and his mom?
680	00:35:06	00:35:10	Yeah... yeah, they had them toss their phones over there, and they took 'em with 'em.
681	00:35:10	00:35:11	Do you know where they were going?
682	00:35:11	00:35:13	They just said Out of town.
683	00:35:13	00:35:18	Control 101, we've got a 444 originating at Van Der Meer Jewelry.
684	00:35:18	00:35:20	This is Code Red channel-- 444 in progress.
685	00:35:20	00:35:24	Suspects may be driving a white EMT vehicle.
686	00:35:24	00:35:26	Point of origin Granholm and Wells Avenue.
687	00:35:26	00:35:28	Babe, they know where we started.
688	00:35:28	00:35:31	They always do. We're always fine.
689	00:35:31	00:35:33	Did you take the number off the roof?
690	00:35:33	00:35:35	Did one better. Switched it for another rig.
691	00:35:35	00:35:36	They're scrambled, but looking for him.
692	00:35:36	00:35:38	And they're giving us the heads up.
693	00:35:38	00:35:41	2-Charlie-34, proceeding eastbound on Sahara towards Kings Road.
694	00:35:41	00:35:43	The radio.
695	00:35:43	00:35:44	That's how you always knew where to be.
696	00:35:44	00:35:46	And where not to be.
697	00:35:46	00:35:50	Plus, getting away is always easier when you can change traffic lights.
698	00:35:50	00:35:51	What are you gonna do with us?
699	00:35:51	00:35:53	We're driving to the desert where we have a car.
700	00:35:53	00:35:54	We're leaving you there.
701	00:35:54	00:35:56	Next stop, Fiji.
702	00:35:56	00:35:59	How on earth are we gonna get back from the desert?
703	00:35:59	00:36:02	We're not, Mom.
704	00:36:02	00:36:05	Patrol, 2-Charlie-7, west from Lonnie Avenue.
705	00:36:05	00:36:06	No sign of anything yet.
706	00:36:06	00:36:09	Copy that, 2-Charlie-7.
707	00:36:09	00:36:11	Don't worry. We'll get 'em.
708	00:36:11	00:36:13	Your dad scrambled the entire department.
709	00:36:13	00:36:14	Good guys are everywhere.
710	00:36:14	00:36:16	Yeah, they were there before.
711	00:36:16	00:36:18	Yeah, but listen to 'em, uh...
712	00:36:18	00:36:20	on a red channel, open to everyone.
713	00:36:20	00:36:21	They're all talking back and forth.
714	00:36:21	00:36:23	Air Three, Control. Are you up?
715	00:36:23	00:36:24	Control, Air Three. Beginning sweep...
716	00:36:24	00:36:26	They're talking to each other.
717	00:36:26	00:36:30	And if we can hear them... so can an ambulance.
718	00:36:30	00:36:34	Copy all. This is Charlie-12, 465 and I-15 southbound exit.
719	00:36:34	00:36:36	Hey.
720	00:36:36	00:36:38	I need your help.
721	00:36:38	00:36:41	2-Charlie-2, we have a visual on possible vehicle.
722	00:36:41	00:36:42	We need backup to Tropicana Way.
723	00:36:42	00:36:44	They're heading to the other side of town.
724	00:36:44	00:36:46	We should be good.
725	00:36:46	00:36:48	...proceed to northwest corner of...
726	00:36:48	00:36:50	Please, do something.
727	00:36:50	00:36:52	Like what?
728	00:36:52	00:36:53	I don't know. You're this big police person.
729	00:36:53	00:36:57	I'm a criminalist. Lab rat, Mom. That's it.
730	00:36:57	00:36:59	You know what I do all day?
731	00:36:59	00:37:02	I measure and analyze tiny bits of tiny.
732	00:37:02	00:37:04	Is it exciting? Not always.
733	00:37:04	00:37:06	Is it fulfilling? Very much so.
734	00:37:06	00:37:07	David... No!
735	00:37:07	00:37:09	...I don't expect...
736	00:37:09	00:37:11	No, I need to get this off my chest before we die.
737	00:37:11	00:37:13	Sit down! Sit down!
738	00:37:13	00:37:16	My office is exactly the size it needs to be.
739	00:37:16	00:37:19	Morgan is not my girlfriend.
740	00:37:19	00:37:20	Sweetheart, what...?
741	00:37:20	00:37:22	And I can't save us.
742	00:37:22	00:37:25	I'm not this great police guru that you make me out to be.
743	00:37:25	00:37:27	I can't.
744	00:37:27	00:37:29	I'm not perfect.
745	00:37:29	00:37:35	All I have is a love for my job and a very detailed knowledge of the physical limitations of duct tape.
746	00:37:38	00:37:39	What the hell did you do?!
747	00:37:39	00:37:41	Haloperidol.
748	00:37:41	00:37:43	Thanks for keeping it handy. Now pull over.
749	00:37:43	00:37:45	I have visual on an ambulance.
750	00:37:45	00:37:47	(siren wailing) What are you doing?
751	00:37:47	00:37:49	You won't shoot me.
752	00:37:49	00:37:52	Not if I keep it at a speed that will kill us all if you do.
753	00:37:52	00:37:55	They're tracking a decoy rig to the other side of town.
754	00:37:55	00:37:58	Nothing between us and the desert, not even tr...
755	00:37:59	00:38:02	Traffic.
756	00:38:02	00:38:04	David!
757	00:38:05	00:38:08	Dispatch, this is 2-Charlie-25 in pursuit of suspect northbound on Tipper Drive.
758	00:38:08	00:38:11	2-Charlie-6, lost visual on suspect vehicle.
759	00:38:11	00:38:12	2-Charlie-12, do you have a visual?
760	00:38:12	00:38:16	Control, 2-Charlie-22, negative visual.
761	00:38:16	00:38:20	Unit 15, can you get eyes on?
762	00:38:22	00:38:26	Control, 2-Charlie-6, suspect is evading pursuit.
763	00:38:26	00:38:28	All units converge.
764	00:38:28	00:38:30	2-Charlie-12. Vehicle is cornered.
765	00:38:30	00:38:32	Do we have eyes on the hostages? Are they safe?
766	00:38:32	00:38:34	Come on!
767	00:38:34	00:38:36	Dispatch, this is Unit Four. Suspects have been apprehended.
768	00:38:36	00:38:38	I repeat, suspects have been apprehended.
769	00:38:38	00:38:40	Yeah!
770	00:38:43	00:38:45	Yes, sir!
771	00:38:45	00:38:48	2-Charlie-22. Suspects apprehended.
772	00:38:48	00:38:50	Do we have eyes on the hostages?
773	00:38:50	00:38:52	Go.
774	00:38:52	00:38:54	Okay?
775	00:38:54	00:38:56	Okay. Yeah, thanks.
776	00:39:01	00:39:03	How did you...?
777	00:39:03	00:39:04	Morgan called me.
778	00:39:04	00:39:06	Had us switch channels to flush them out.
779	00:39:15	00:39:20	You have to admit it, as far as plans go, this was damn well thought-out.
780	00:39:20	00:39:22	Yeah, she had a jewelry storefront.
781	00:39:22	00:39:25	She could ask all the right questions, and wait for the perfect weekend.
782	00:39:25	00:39:27	While he gets comfortable as an EMT.
783	00:39:27	00:39:30	Learning the roads in whatever city they're in.
784	00:39:30	00:39:32	Police procedures, escape route.
785	00:39:32	00:39:35	Yeah, then the money runs thin, and they just steal some more.
786	00:39:35	00:39:36	Move to a new city. Uh-huh.
787	00:39:36	00:39:38	Did you get the husband to crack?
788	00:39:38	00:39:41	No. In fact, he's taking the rap for the whole thing.
789	00:39:41	00:39:44	Well, he did promise to love and protect.
790	00:39:44	00:39:48	Yeah, which is ironic, because she threw him under the bus five minutes in. Women.
791	00:39:48	00:39:56	I, uh, found some other stolen things in the ambulance, and if it's okay with you two, I'd like to return one tiny piece of evidence.
792	00:39:56	00:39:57	On what grounds?
793	00:39:57	00:39:59	It has sentimental value.
794	00:39:59	00:40:01	I didn't know you had sentiments.
795	00:40:01	00:40:03	I didn't say they were mine.
796	00:40:08	00:40:10	I'm sorry...
797	00:40:11	00:40:12	...for the ruse.
798	00:40:12	00:40:15	I just wanted you to be proud of me.
799	00:40:16	00:40:17	Proud?
800	00:40:17	00:40:19	You saved my life.
801	00:40:19	00:40:24	You're great at what you do, you're loved by so many.
802	00:40:24	00:40:27	I couldn't be prouder.
803	00:40:28	00:40:35	Besides, I haven't been totally honest with you about my romantic situation.
804	00:40:35	00:40:37	What, the Count?
805	00:40:37	00:40:38	He wasn't a Count.
806	00:40:38	00:40:40	It's possible he doesn't even know how to.
807	00:40:42	00:40:43	He dumped me weeks ago.
808	00:40:43	00:40:46	Oh. What about Italy?
809	00:40:46	00:40:48	Oh, the trip's still on. Non-refundable.
810	00:40:48	00:40:53	So it's penne Bolognese for one.
811	00:40:56	00:40:59	You know, I have a few vacation days saved up.
812	00:40:59	00:41:03	Would you like to have a travel amico?
813	00:41:03	00:41:05	Ah, David, that's okay.
814	00:41:05	00:41:07	You don't have to.
815	00:41:07	00:41:09	I know.
816	00:41:09	00:41:10	I want to.
817	00:41:22	00:41:23	You found it.
818	00:41:37	00:41:43	The sun was shining on the sea, shining with all his might.
819	00:41:43	00:41:48	He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright.
820	00:41:48	00:41:51	And this was odd because it was the middle of the night.
821	00:41:51	00:41:58	The moon was shining sulkily because she thought the sun had got no business to be there after the day was done.
822	00:41:58	00:42:07	'It's very rude of him,' she said, 'to come and spoil the fun!' The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry.
823	00:42:07	00:42:11	You could not see a cloud because no cloud was in the sky.
824	00:42:11	00:42:16	No birds were flying overhead, there were no birds to fly.
825	00:42:16	00:42:20	The Walrus and the Carpenter were walking close at hand.
826	00:42:22	00:42:25	They wept like anything to see such quantities of sand.
827	00:42:30	00:42:53	'If this were only cleared away,' they said, 'it would be grand!' If seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year, 'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said, 'That they could get it clear?' 'I doubt it,' said the Carpenter, and shed a bitter tear.
