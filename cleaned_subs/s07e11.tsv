0	00:00:20	00:00:21	...nice and hot, 'kay?
1	00:00:21	00:00:25	And again, we always add the salt and pepper.
2	00:00:27	00:00:28	Piece of crap.
3	00:00:28	00:00:31	...hits the pan and you want to listen for that sound.
4	00:00:31	00:00:34	That is the most important sound. (creaks)
5	00:00:34	00:00:35	Jay?
6	00:00:35	00:00:37	Is that you?
7	00:00:37	00:00:42	...next we're gonna add the tomatoes, which sometimes have enough sugar, but really when you've got the natural sugar...
8	00:00:54	00:00:57	...tomatoes, some tomato juice.
9	00:00:57	00:01:02	Now if you don't... if tomatoes aren't in season, they're not really...
10	00:01:02	00:01:11	CSI processed the knife and found blood from four different sources, three of which were intermingled together on the blade.
11	00:01:11	00:01:14	One matched Addie Finch, the victim.
12	00:01:16	00:01:19	The other two were also female.
13	00:01:19	00:01:24	And based on the number of DNA markers they have in common, they're either sisters or mother and daughter.
14	00:01:24	00:01:26	They are not related to Addie Finch.
15	00:01:26	00:01:27	And both remain unidentified.
16	00:01:27	00:01:29	And the fourth DNA source?
17	00:01:29	00:01:37	When I disassembled the knife, I found blood on the tang, which is the steel area under the handle.
18	00:01:37	00:01:39	Were you able to identify this DNA?
19	00:01:39	00:01:43	It was a match to the victim's son, Jay Gregory Finch.
20	00:01:43	00:01:44	The defendant.
21	00:01:44	00:01:45	That's right.
22	00:01:45	00:01:49	Cross-examination, Mr. Novak?
23	00:01:49	00:01:51	Did you recover the knife from the scene three years ago?
24	00:01:51	00:01:54	No, the defendant turned it in to P.D.
25	00:01:54	00:01:59	A man comes home... only to find his mother bleeding on the floor, a knife stuck in her chest.
26	00:01:59	00:02:04	In a desperate attempt to save her life, he removes the knife from her chest.
27	00:02:04	00:02:06	But it's too late.
28	00:02:06	00:02:12	He takes the knife in question to the authorities, cooperates with their investigation, and then you charge him with murder.
29	00:02:12	00:02:16	The defendant did not call for help, and he waited five days to turn it in.
30	00:02:16	00:02:17	He was in shock.
31	00:02:17	00:02:19	You found two unknown sources of blood on that knife.
32	00:02:19	00:02:22	Isn't it possible that one or both of them killed Addie Finch?
33	00:02:22	00:02:23	Objection. Speculative.
34	00:02:23	00:02:24	I'll allow it.
35	00:02:24	00:02:27	It's possible.
36	00:02:27	00:02:31	However, Mr. Finch's blood was found isolated near the handle.
37	00:02:31	00:02:33	Stabbing is a messy business.
38	00:02:33	00:02:34	I believe that Mr. Finch cut himself...
39	00:02:35	00:02:37	You've been warned about speculation, Ms. Willows.
40	00:02:37	00:02:38	It's not speculation.
41	00:02:38	00:02:43	From his birth until the time of his mother's death, Mr. Finch lived in that house.
42	00:02:43	00:02:46	Isn't it equally possible he cut himself on that knife at a separate occasion?
43	00:02:46	00:02:47	Yes, but...
44	00:02:47	00:02:49	For the record, her answer was Yes, it's possible.
45	00:02:49	00:02:52	No further questions.
46	00:02:54	00:02:59	Though Addie Finch received multiple stab wounds, the actual cause of death was a gunshot wound.
47	00:02:59	00:03:01	Isn't that correct?
48	00:03:01	00:03:11	We believe that the defendant stabbed his mother multiple times, stood over her while she was dying, and shot her in the forehead to complete the act.
49	00:03:11	00:03:13	You recovered a bullet from Ms. Finch's body.
50	00:03:13	00:03:15	Did you also recover a gun?
51	00:03:15	00:03:16	No.
52	00:03:16	00:03:19	So you have nothing with which to forensically match the bullet?
53	00:03:19	00:03:21	The bullet was a .38.
54	00:03:21	00:03:27	The defendant's father, who passed away in 1989, was seen in photographs holding a .38.
55	00:03:27	00:03:33	We also found an empty gun case in the defendant's closet, which tested positive for chromium steel.
56	00:03:33	00:03:36	My belt buckle is also made of metal.
57	00:03:36	00:03:38	If I kept it in a box, wouldn't it also test positive?
58	00:03:38	00:03:40	Do you keep it in a velvet-lined gun box?
59	00:03:40	00:03:43	No further questions.
60	00:03:45	00:03:51	On the sole count of murder in the first degree, we, the jury, find the defendant, Jay Gregory Finch...
61	00:03:51	00:03:52	not guilty.
62	00:03:58	00:04:00	Thank you.
63	00:04:00	00:04:01	Take care of yourself.
64	00:04:03	00:04:05	Quite the salesman, Mr. Novak.
65	00:04:05	00:04:06	Not a hard sell.
66	00:04:06	00:04:07	Finch is guilty.
67	00:04:08	00:04:09	You once said the same about me.
68	00:04:09	00:04:10	You were wrong then, too.
69	00:04:11	00:04:13	Yeah, you're not a murderer, you just set them free.
70	00:04:47	00:04:49	Why didn't you bring the knife directly to us?
71	00:04:49	00:04:53	I get these anxiety attacks...
72	00:04:53	00:04:57	since I hit my head real bad playing football my senior year.
73	00:04:57	00:05:00	I get these brutal headaches.
74	00:05:01	00:05:03	So, I climb into my car and drive.
75	00:05:03	00:05:05	Sometimes for days.
76	00:05:05	00:05:07	It... it calms me.
77	00:05:07	00:05:10	Mom and I took care of each other.
78	00:05:10	00:05:12	We were a good team.
79	00:05:14	00:05:16	What a load of crap.
80	00:05:16	00:05:18	We found his bags packed near the door.
81	00:05:18	00:05:21	Addie raised a momma's boy and she'd finally had enough.
82	00:05:21	00:05:23	She was kicking his ass out and he snapped.
83	00:05:23	00:05:24	Did Finch have a history of violence?
84	00:05:24	00:05:30	No, but his CT scan showed damage to the amygdala and the frontal lobe.
85	00:05:30	00:05:35	That kind of injury has been known to change personality, to make a person more inclined to violence.
86	00:05:35	00:05:38	We need to ID his other two victims.
87	00:05:38	00:05:40	Charge Finch with a new crime.
88	00:05:40	00:05:41	No double jeopardy.
89	00:05:41	00:05:42	We can even use the knife again.
90	00:05:42	00:05:44	Catherine, we tried three years ago.
91	00:05:44	00:05:47	There were no other female related crimes in the Vegas metro area that week.
92	00:05:47	00:05:48	He drove for five days, Nick.
93	00:05:48	00:05:52	Yes, and as I recall, we put out a broadcast covering cities statewide.
94	00:05:52	00:05:55	But not to any of the small towns in between.
95	00:05:55	00:05:56	They aren't connected to a central network.
96	00:05:56	00:05:58	Needle in a haystack.
97	00:05:58	00:06:01	It's our job to find a needle in a haystack.
98	00:06:09	00:06:11	How did you know about this?
99	00:06:11	00:06:14	I saw an approved leave of absence form on Ecklie's desk.
100	00:06:14	00:06:16	Don't worry, I didn't say anything to anyone else.
101	00:06:16	00:06:20	Did you think that you were going to teach at my alma mater in the dead of winter without warm clothes?
102	00:06:20	00:06:22	I thought you went to college in San Diego.
103	00:06:22	00:06:23	Graduate school.
104	00:06:23	00:06:26	Undergraduate was all about the Bay State.
105	00:06:26	00:06:29	Crazy times, my friend, crazy times.
106	00:06:29	00:06:31	Those Hampshire girls down in Amherst?
107	00:06:31	00:06:33	Insane.
108	00:06:33	00:06:34	Thank you.
109	00:06:34	00:06:36	You're welcome.
110	00:06:38	00:06:39	What are you teaching?
111	00:06:42	00:06:48	The seasonal fluctuations in observed behaviors of the Walden Pond swamp mosquito.
112	00:06:48	00:06:50	Excellent.
113	00:06:50	00:06:58	I don't know what college was like for you, but for me it was a new beginning, a chance to reinvent myself.
114	00:06:58	00:07:01	For the first time in my life, I felt like I fit in.
115	00:07:01	00:07:03	Not like now.
116	00:07:03	00:07:04	I mean...
117	00:07:04	00:07:08	you and I are close, but sometimes I just don't think the others get me.
118	00:07:08	00:07:09	You got a second?
119	00:07:09	00:07:10	He's kind of busy.
120	00:07:12	00:07:14	Oh.
121	00:07:14	00:07:17	When you get a chance, hit the Purple Pint.
122	00:07:17	00:07:18	Ask for Cookie.
123	00:07:18	00:07:20	Tell her Davey Hodges sent you.
124	00:07:20	00:07:21	Drinks'll be on the house.
125	00:07:21	00:07:23	Crazy times.
126	00:07:23	00:07:25	Yeah.
127	00:07:27	00:07:31	Jay Finch got an oil change the day that he killed his mother.
128	00:07:31	00:07:37	We compared the odometer reading on the work order against what it read when we impounded his car.
129	00:07:37	00:07:38	The difference was 350 miles.
130	00:07:38	00:07:40	We used that to create a search radius.
131	00:07:40	00:07:45	Nick and I just spent six hours on the phone with sheriffs in every county inside that area.
132	00:07:45	00:07:49	There was one unsolved case that matched our criteria in Larkston.
133	00:07:49	00:07:53	A Laura Montoya and her 12-year-old daughter, Robyn.
134	00:07:53	00:07:54	Why are we talking about this?
135	00:07:54	00:07:55	Finch got off, didn't he?
136	00:07:55	00:07:57	And I don't buy it. I need to go to Larkston.
137	00:07:57	00:07:58	You can't.
138	00:07:58	00:08:00	Look, I want a second shot at this guy.
139	00:08:00	00:08:02	I want to get him before he kills again.
140	00:08:02	00:08:04	I'm going on sabbatical.
141	00:08:04	00:08:07	You're gonna be the acting supervisor while I'm gone.
142	00:08:08	00:08:10	When are you leaving?
143	00:08:10	00:08:12	Tomorrow night.
144	00:08:14	00:08:16	I'll be back before then.
145	00:08:17	00:08:18	How long have you known about this?
146	00:08:38	00:08:39	Need a vacation?
147	00:08:39	00:08:41	I guess I should be grateful you didn't stop by my house.
148	00:08:41	00:08:43	And get a gun in my face? No, thank you.
149	00:08:43	00:08:44	I can take a hint.
150	00:08:44	00:08:48	What do you want?
151	00:08:48	00:08:49	I'm here waving a white flag.
152	00:08:49	00:08:52	Look, I owe you an apology.
153	00:08:52	00:08:54	I regret the way I've behaved toward you in the past.
154	00:08:54	00:08:59	I've sobered up, and I want to make amends.
155	00:08:59	00:09:01	Climbing the 12 Steps.
156	00:09:01	00:09:03	Got a few more to go.
157	00:09:03	00:09:04	Well, you can check me off the list.
158	00:09:05	00:09:08	Thank you for stopping by.
159	00:09:10	00:09:12	Hey...
160	00:09:12	00:09:17	which pissed you off more, that Finch went free or that I won?
161	00:09:17	00:09:19	I'm 50-50.
162	00:09:21	00:09:23	There's still hope for me.
163	00:09:28	00:09:29	You all right?
164	00:09:29	00:09:31	Perfect timing.
165	00:09:31	00:09:32	Let's go.
166	00:09:53	00:09:55	Sabbatical's usually a euphemism for sayonara.
167	00:09:55	00:09:58	I don't think Grissom's coming back.
168	00:09:58	00:09:59	Why wouldn't he?
169	00:09:59	00:10:04	I don't know, he shaved his beard, he's lost a little weight, he's been leaving when shift is over.
170	00:10:04	00:10:07	I think he even took a day off last week.
171	00:10:07	00:10:09	Maybe he's got himself a girlfriend.
172	00:10:09	00:10:10	That's what I'm saying.
173	00:10:10	00:10:14	You know, I thought you were going to leave a few months ago.
174	00:10:14	00:10:15	Why, 'cause I shaved my beard?
175	00:10:17	00:10:19	No, I mean, I...
176	00:10:19	00:10:22	you don't really have to work anymore if you don't want to, right?
177	00:10:22	00:10:23	What are you talking about?
178	00:10:23	00:10:26	Well... Sam, with your dad...
179	00:10:26	00:10:27	the whole thing.
180	00:10:27	00:10:29	Oh, is that what people think?
181	00:10:29	00:10:31	That daddy's little girl got herself a big inheritance?
182	00:10:31	00:10:33	Well, let me tell you something, Nicky.
183	00:10:33	00:10:41	All of Sam's money is tied up in a big hole in the ground on a very nice piece of Strip real estate, but I got no dog in that fight.
184	00:10:57	00:11:00	Now you guys aren't here to make me look bad, are you?
185	00:11:00	00:11:03	No. Just busting chops.
186	00:11:03	00:11:04	Sheriff Beth McGuire.
187	00:11:04	00:11:06	Nick Stokes. Nice to meet you.
188	00:11:06	00:11:07	Catherine Willows. Nice to meet you. Hi.
189	00:11:07	00:11:09	I just read that file that you sent over.
190	00:11:09	00:11:14	Jay Finch, he looks like a real son of a bitch.
191	00:11:14	00:11:17	Laura Montoya, she was a good friend of mine.
192	00:11:17	00:11:19	So, uh... hey, Ronnie.
193	00:11:19	00:11:21	How you doing?
194	00:11:21	00:11:23	I would really be happy to see this case solved.
195	00:11:24	00:11:25	Yeah, as would we.
196	00:11:25	00:11:29	Why don't you... run us through it, Sheriff?
197	00:11:29	00:11:31	Okay. Uh...
198	00:11:31	00:11:32	Laura...
199	00:11:33	00:11:38	and her daughter were right... here eating burgers and drinking shakes.
200	00:11:38	00:11:40	They were the last customers of the night.
201	00:11:40	00:11:45	Jake Hanson closed up, and then he left and they were still right here, eating.
202	00:11:45	00:11:46	I'm heading home, girls.
203	00:11:46	00:11:49	Don't you stay all night.
204	00:11:49	00:11:50	Stay hi to your mom, Jake.
205	00:11:50	00:11:52	00 p.m.
206	00:11:52	00:11:53	Couple of local skateboarders.
207	00:11:53	00:11:56	They saw the blood and they just, you know, called it in.
208	00:11:56	00:11:57	No bodies?
209	00:11:57	00:12:01	No. Just a blood pool...
210	00:12:01	00:12:02	here.
211	00:12:02	00:12:07	I found some blood drops leading out through the parking lot towards the main road.
212	00:12:07	00:12:08	Abduction?
213	00:12:09	00:12:09	I don't know.
214	00:12:10	00:12:17	One minute, my best friend is just having an Oreo smoothie with her kid, and then the next minute all I got is blood drops.
215	00:12:17	00:12:20	Did you identify who the blood belonged to?
216	00:12:20	00:12:21	We sent a sample to the Reno Lab.
217	00:12:22	00:12:23	Came back a match to Laura.
218	00:12:23	00:12:24	Mother's the bigger threat.
219	00:12:24	00:12:26	Probably took her out first.
220	00:12:26	00:12:29	And once she was injured, the daughter got scared into compliance.
221	00:12:29	00:12:33	Any idea on the mode of death?
222	00:12:33	00:12:37	Well, I know your guy used a knife and a gun, but I didn't recover any weapons.
223	00:12:37	00:12:40	We're gonna need a blood sample to compare to our knife.
224	00:12:40	00:12:42	I-I got that back in the fridge at the station.
225	00:12:42	00:12:46	You know, there are quite a few nicks in the pavement down here.
226	00:12:46	00:12:48	So if Laura was seated here...
227	00:12:49	00:12:54	the shooter would've had to aim downward to impact the asphalt.
228	00:12:54	00:12:57	Then this would have been the trajectory of the bullet.
229	00:12:57	00:13:02	Now, there's what appears to be a ricochet mark headed in the right direction.
230	00:13:03	00:13:05	Killer shoots Laura from behind...
231	00:13:09	00:13:11	Wait a minute.
232	00:13:21	00:13:22	Oh, yeah.
233	00:13:22	00:13:24	I think we're in business, ladies.
234	00:13:48	00:13:49	Hey, Gris.
235	00:13:49	00:13:53	So, uh, Hodges tells me you're flying the coop.
236	00:13:53	00:13:55	What's the matter, you sick of baby-sitting?
237	00:13:55	00:13:56	Just the opposite.
238	00:13:56	00:13:58	I'm a teacher without any students.
239	00:13:58	00:14:01	I've still got a lot to learn.
240	00:14:01	00:14:03	Besides, having you around kinda keeps me honest.
241	00:14:03	00:14:06	Whether you know it or not, you're the rock of my team.
242	00:14:06	00:14:10	Catherine's going to be in charge for a while while I'm gone.
243	00:14:10	00:14:13	Be there for her like you've been there for me and we'll all be fine.
244	00:14:13	00:14:15	Thanks. It means a lot.
245	00:14:15	00:14:17	You know I got you covered.
246	00:14:18	00:14:20	What, are you sending those to the... the Louvre?
247	00:14:20	00:14:24	Ernie Dell did kill with an artistic touch.
248	00:14:36	00:14:39	.25 caliber.
249	00:14:39	00:14:40	Finch used a .38.
250	00:14:42	00:14:43	No dice, huh?
251	00:14:43	00:14:48	Finch could've used a different gun, but chances are, yeah, they're unrelated.
252	00:14:48	00:14:49	When you guys called, I...
253	00:14:49	00:14:52	I let myself believe that Laura was still alive.
254	00:14:54	00:14:58	Well, now, I'm, I'm just gonna pray that she's dead.
255	00:14:58	00:15:01	I just don't want to think about the alternative.
256	00:15:01	00:15:03	Thank you for your help, Beth.
257	00:15:04	00:15:05	I gotta call her sister in Denver.
258	00:15:05	00:15:07	This'll be the second time I've gotten her hopes up.
259	00:15:08	00:15:09	There was a first time?
260	00:15:10	00:15:12	Well, there was a double murder the day after Laura went missing.
261	00:15:12	00:15:14	It was about 20 miles outside of Larkston.
262	00:15:14	00:15:24	A Mary Acheson and her daughter, Heather Curtis. At first, I, I thought it was related to the disappearance of Robin and Laura, but, but it wasn't.
263	00:15:24	00:15:27	Why didn't you tell us this before?
264	00:15:27	00:15:28	It's a closed case.
265	00:15:28	00:15:29	We got the guy.
266	00:15:30	00:15:33	Robert Guffey.
267	00:15:33	00:15:36	Okay... He's in, uh...
268	00:15:36	00:15:41	Carson City. He's doing a life term in the Nevada state prison.
269	00:15:41	00:15:47	Yeah. His bloody fingerprints were all over the crime scene, and he confessed the next day.
270	00:15:47	00:15:52	So you initially thought that Guffey was also good for your friend Laura and her daughter's abduction.
271	00:15:52	00:15:53	What changed your mind?
272	00:15:53	00:15:57	There was no evidence to link him and he had an alibi.
273	00:15:57	00:16:00	Plus, he would only admit to Heather and Mary's murders.
274	00:16:00	00:16:01	How'd he kill them?
275	00:16:01	00:16:03	Stabbed, then shot.
276	00:16:03	00:16:06	This is Heather Curtis.
277	00:16:06	00:16:10	She and her husband lived with Mary Acheson, her mother.
278	00:16:10	00:16:12	So, uh...
279	00:16:12	00:16:17	Shawn was at work, and then he called home, and then when nobody answered the phone, he knew that something was wrong.
280	00:16:17	00:16:19	So the son was home?
281	00:16:19	00:16:21	He was hiding.
282	00:16:24	00:16:26	That. That's Robert Guffey.
283	00:16:26	00:16:27	So Guffey knew the victims?
284	00:16:27	00:16:29	He was their plumber.
285	00:16:29	00:16:32	Yeah. Old house, bad pipes.
286	00:16:32	00:16:33	Oh, he was there all the time.
287	00:16:33	00:16:35	Says here he has a history of violence.
288	00:16:35	00:16:36	Beat his girlfriend.
289	00:16:36	00:16:39	Oh, yeah, and his ex-wife has a T.R.O. against him.
290	00:16:39	00:16:41	But this is his very first murder.
291	00:16:41	00:16:43	Unless, of course, he killed Addie Finch first.
292	00:16:45	00:16:47	So maybe you're looking for my guy.
293	00:16:52	00:16:54	Was Guffey in Vegas that week?
294	00:16:54	00:16:56	I don't know.
295	00:16:56	00:16:57	I didn't ask him.
296	00:16:57	00:16:59	Did you recover a handgun?
297	00:16:59	00:17:00	Yeah. Oh, yeah, at his house.
298	00:17:00	00:17:02	It was a .38, same caliber as your case.
299	00:17:02	00:17:04	But you couldn't match the bullets to it?
300	00:17:05	00:17:12	Reno Lab said that the bullets were too damaged, you know, from bouncing around inside the victims' skulls so they just couldn't get any kind of comparison at all.
301	00:17:12	00:17:14	I'm assuming you have the blood samples from the two victims?
302	00:17:14	00:17:19	They're at the Reno Lab, but, uh... I can do you one better.
303	00:17:19	00:17:21	You can take your own samples.
304	00:17:32	00:17:34	Just a sec, I'm gonna open this thing.
305	00:17:36	00:17:39	You thinking what I'm thinking?
306	00:17:39	00:17:40	Looks like Addie Finch's house.
307	00:17:43	00:17:45	Danny and Shawn got an apartment in town.
308	00:17:45	00:17:48	They've never been back here.
309	00:17:48	00:17:54	And Shawn, he can't quite bring himself to sell the place.
310	00:17:54	00:17:57	So, nothing inside's been touched in three years?
311	00:17:57	00:18:01	Nope. This door is a time machine.
312	00:18:06	00:18:09	This blood pool belongs to Mary, the mom.
313	00:18:09	00:18:15	And, uh... this blood down here belongs to Heather, the daughter.
314	00:18:15	00:18:17	Screen door's ripped.
315	00:18:18	00:18:19	Must have been a struggle.
316	00:18:19	00:18:22	We printed it, only got smeared partials.
317	00:18:22	00:18:24	Mary answers the door.
318	00:18:24	00:18:26	The killer forces his way in...
319	00:18:26	00:18:27	stabs her.
320	00:18:36	00:18:38	Heather comes to her mother's aid.
321	00:18:38	00:18:39	Mom?
322	00:18:42	00:18:44	Gets stabbed herself.
323	00:18:52	00:18:53	And flees to the kitchen.
324	00:18:53	00:18:59	The killer finishes Mary off and hunts Heather down.
325	00:18:59	00:19:05	He catches up with Heather and executes her as well.
326	00:19:09	00:19:11	This is where we found Danny.
327	00:19:12	00:19:14	Poor little guy had peed in his pants.
328	00:19:14	00:19:16	He wouldn't come out to anybody but his dad.
329	00:19:16	00:19:19	Is this the phone that you pulled Guffey's prints from?
330	00:19:19	00:19:21	Uh... yeah.
331	00:19:21	00:19:28	Guffey admitted to having made an anonymous 911 call from the house 20 p.m.
332	00:19:28	00:19:31	And he didn't stick around.
333	00:19:32	00:19:34	Whose blood on the door handle?
334	00:19:34	00:19:35	Oh, we tested it.
335	00:19:35	00:19:37	That's a mixture of the victims'.
336	00:19:37	00:19:43	I think whoever did this might have seen Danny's toys in the backyard, thought the job wasn't done yet...
337	00:19:43	00:19:47	and went outside to finish it.
338	00:20:40	00:20:42	He shot the rabbits.
339	00:20:42	00:20:44	I believe that Guffey thought that Danny was inside.
340	00:20:44	00:20:46	We got a confession.
341	00:20:46	00:20:48	We didn't need those bullets, so we didn't collect them.
342	00:20:51	00:20:55	So we found one bullet in Addie Finch, you found one in Mary, one in Heather.
343	00:20:55	00:20:57	There was three in this hutch.
344	00:20:57	00:21:01	If all these bullets were shot from the same .38, six would kick it.
345	00:21:01	00:21:05	Three murders, one gun, one killer.
346	00:21:05	00:21:07	But was it Guffey, or was it Finch?
347	00:21:07	00:21:09	Well, these bullets should answer that question.
348	00:21:09	00:21:10	Let's start digging.
349	00:22:01	00:22:02	There's enough here for a comparison.
350	00:22:03	00:22:09	Good. Good, if it matches Guffey's gun, he stays in prison, but if it doesn't, we've got no gun to tie to Finch.
351	00:22:09	00:22:12	You need to get all the evidence back to the lab.
352	00:22:12	00:22:13	What are you gonna do?
353	00:22:13	00:22:15	I'm gonna go see Guffey.
354	00:22:15	00:22:18	He's not gonna talk to you, Catherine.
355	00:22:18	00:22:21	We'll see.
356	00:22:25	00:22:27	Hey, how's it going on your civil case?
357	00:22:27	00:22:29	Did you get a lawyer?
358	00:22:29	00:22:31	LVPD said they'll provide me with an attorney.
359	00:22:31	00:22:32	Get your own counsel, Greg.
360	00:22:32	00:22:33	That's your right.
361	00:22:33	00:22:36	Well, are you gonna give me a raise?
362	00:22:36	00:22:38	Because otherwise, I can't afford that.
363	00:22:38	00:22:41	Call the PPACE, talk to your union rep.
364	00:22:41	00:22:44	This was an on-duty incident.
365	00:22:44	00:22:45	They'll provide you with an attorney.
366	00:22:45	00:22:48	How's the union lawyer gonna be any different?
367	00:22:48	00:22:50	The department's only interest is the department.
368	00:22:50	00:22:53	They'll throw you under the bus to protect themselves.
369	00:22:53	00:22:54	When's your deposition?
370	00:22:54	00:22:56	Three weeks from tomorrow.
371	00:22:56	00:22:58	Stick to whatever you put in the report.
372	00:22:58	00:23:01	Don't waiver, be consistent.
373	00:23:01	00:23:02	Everything's gonna be fine.
374	00:23:04	00:23:06	Hi, you've reached CSI Catherine Willows.
375	00:23:06	00:23:08	Please leave a message at the tone.
376	00:23:08	00:23:11	Yeah, Cath, it's Doc Robbins.
377	00:23:11	00:23:13	I reviewed the autopsy photos on all three victims.
378	00:23:13	00:23:17	The wounds appear consistent in all three cases.
379	00:23:17	00:23:24	Vics were stabbed in the chest, and then presumably while choking on their own blood, they were shot.
380	00:23:24	00:23:27	single GSW to the head.
381	00:23:45	00:23:47	Robert Guffey?
382	00:23:57	00:23:59	I don't know you.
383	00:23:59	00:24:02	You can call me Catherine.
384	00:24:02	00:24:04	Unless you're here for a conjugal, I'm not calling you anything.
385	00:24:04	00:24:06	What do you like to be called?
386	00:24:06	00:24:08	The best I ever had.
387	00:24:17	00:24:23	There was a murder that was committed in Vegas two days before the Acheson-Curtis murders.
388	00:24:23	00:24:26	I think the same person committed both crimes and I think that person is you.
389	00:24:30	00:24:32	Mr. Guffey, this is how this is going to work.
390	00:24:32	00:24:37	Every time you answer one of my questions, I unbutton a button.
391	00:24:38	00:24:39	Are you ready?
392	00:24:41	00:24:43	Does that count as a question?
393	00:24:48	00:24:50	You recognize this woman?
394	00:24:50	00:24:52	Nope.
395	00:24:56	00:24:57	That's it.
396	00:24:57	00:24:59	Playing ball.
397	00:25:02	00:25:05	Why did you kill Mary Acheson and Heather Curtis?
398	00:25:08	00:25:10	Ah, 'cause sometimes women get killed.
399	00:25:12	00:25:15	Oh, don't be like that.
400	00:25:15	00:25:17	Well, that wasn't an answer.
401	00:25:17	00:25:19	It was enough for those other cops.
402	00:25:19	00:25:20	What's that supposed to mean?
403	00:25:20	00:25:24	That, uh, means I didn't do it.
404	00:25:25	00:25:26	Well, then why did you confess?
405	00:25:26	00:25:31	They had me in a room for 12 hours...
406	00:25:31	00:25:37	no food, no water, no sleep.
407	00:25:37	00:25:40	I had to beg to use the bathroom.
408	00:25:40	00:25:42	So now you're claiming you were coerced.
409	00:25:42	00:25:46	I've been claiming that since day one.
410	00:25:46	00:25:48	I recanted the next morning.
411	00:25:48	00:25:49	Button.
412	00:25:58	00:26:00	That bitch cop...
413	00:26:00	00:26:13	grabs my arm, points to this vein and says, That's where the needle will go when they put you down like the dog you are.
414	00:26:13	00:26:21	If I wanted to avoid the death penalty, all I had to tell her was what she and-and-and her deputies wanted to hear.
415	00:26:23	00:26:25	That's worth two.
416	00:26:26	00:26:29	Just pace yourself.
417	00:26:33	00:26:36	How come your prints were found all over the house?
418	00:26:36	00:26:38	Front door was open...
419	00:26:43	00:26:47	Mary? Mary?!
420	00:26:57	00:27:00	There are two dead bodies at the Curtis house.
421	00:27:00	00:27:01	No, no, no, no.
422	00:27:04	00:27:06	So you called for help, but didn't stick around.
423	00:27:06	00:27:14	I done... a few nights in prison for smacking my wife around, my girlfriend before that.
424	00:27:14	00:27:16	I knew how it'd look.
425	00:27:16	00:27:18	No good deed, right?
426	00:27:18	00:27:21	How about just one more for good behavior?
427	00:27:21	00:27:23	Let's see if your story checks out.
428	00:27:31	00:27:32	Hey, Nick. Hey.
429	00:27:32	00:27:33	Where's Catherine?
430	00:27:33	00:27:36	Not back yet. I got a ride here with a local deputy.
431	00:27:36	00:27:38	She told me she was going to be back before I left.
432	00:27:38	00:27:42	Oh, yeah. Listen, about that...
433	00:27:42	00:27:46	I told my folks when I went to college I'd be back, you know?
434	00:27:46	00:27:49	Go to work at the D.A.'s office with my dad.
435	00:27:49	00:27:51	You can kinda see how that turned out.
436	00:27:51	00:27:55	Anyway, I just wanted to say it's been great, man.
437	00:27:55	00:27:58	Really, I've learned a lot from you, man.
438	00:27:58	00:27:59	I'll be back in four weeks.
439	00:27:59	00:28:01	Stop hugging me.
440	00:28:04	00:28:05	Yes, sir.
441	00:28:52	00:28:56	Hey, Catherine, I tested the rabbit bullet to Guffey's gun. No match.
442	00:28:57	00:28:58	He's probably innocent.
443	00:28:58	00:29:02	But, but it did match the stria to the bullet that killed Addie Finch.
444	00:29:02	00:29:06	Which brings us back to Jay Finch and his missing .38.
445	00:29:06	00:29:07	Yes, ma'am, it does.
446	00:29:07	00:29:11	Well, look, the only way we're gonna get a conviction is we place Finch at the Curtis house.
447	00:29:11	00:29:14	In the meantime, have Brass put a tail on Finch.
448	00:29:14	00:29:15	I'm not sure if he's a flight risk.
449	00:29:15	00:29:16	I don't want to take a chance.
450	00:29:17	00:29:19	Okay, okay. And hey, one more thing.
451	00:29:19	00:29:24	Tell the Sheriff that I ran the bullet from her abduction case through IBIS and there was no hit as well. Sorry.
452	00:29:24	00:29:26	I'll tell her.
453	00:29:26	00:29:30	Robert Guffey alleges that he was coerced into a false confession.
454	00:29:30	00:29:32	And you've never heard that one before?
455	00:29:32	00:29:36	Did anything unorthodox happen during his interrogation?
456	00:29:36	00:29:41	What is your point, Catherine?
457	00:29:41	00:29:43	Did you ever do an interrogation tired, Beth?
458	00:29:43	00:29:47	Use your frustration, snap at the suspect just so you can go home?
459	00:29:47	00:29:49	Use all that edge to get a confession?
460	00:29:49	00:29:53	Am I being interrogated now?
461	00:29:53	00:29:58	You questioned Robert Guffey the exact week your best friend and her daughter disappeared.
462	00:29:58	00:30:01	That's not just edge, that's a whole blade.
463	00:30:01	00:30:04	I was sure Guffey was guilty till you showed up.
464	00:30:05	00:30:07	Who admits to a crime he didn't commit?
465	00:30:07	00:30:08	Who does that?
466	00:30:08	00:30:10	People under duress.
467	00:30:10	00:30:16	You come into this town, you make me wrong, and then you go ride off into the sunset.
468	00:30:16	00:30:17	And where does that leave me?
469	00:30:17	00:30:19	With the opportunity to right a wrong.
470	00:30:21	00:30:24	Sir, someone will be with you... Look, I already told you, babe, I ain't going anywhere.
471	00:30:24	00:30:28	So unless you want to have a really screwed-up day, I suggest you get her down here now.
472	00:30:28	00:30:30	Mr. Novak.
473	00:30:30	00:30:31	Where's Willows?
474	00:30:31	00:30:32	Out.
475	00:30:32	00:30:33	How can I help you?
476	00:30:33	00:30:35	Why the hell is this department tailing my client?
477	00:30:35	00:30:36	Concern for his safety?
478	00:30:36	00:30:37	That's cute.
479	00:30:38	00:30:39	Jay Finch was acquitted of his mother's murder.
480	00:30:39	00:30:41	He deserves all the rights of a free man.
481	00:30:41	00:30:45	With all due respect, Mr. Novak, no laws have been broken here.
482	00:30:45	00:30:48	You can't try Finch twice for the same crime.
483	00:30:48	00:30:49	No, but you can for a different crime.
484	00:30:49	00:30:50	Oh, I see.
485	00:30:50	00:30:53	This is a personal vendetta by CSI Willows.
486	00:30:53	00:30:55	Personal to who?
487	00:30:55	00:30:57	Me. She's a man-hater.
488	00:30:57	00:31:00	No surprise, but how long do we have to pay for the sins of her father?
489	00:31:00	00:31:04	You know, Catherine and I get along just great.
490	00:31:04	00:31:06	Maybe it's you.
491	00:31:08	00:31:17	Well, you tell Catherine she continues badgering my client, I will file a claim with the Attorney General's office for oppression under cover of law.
492	00:31:17	00:31:19	Duly noted.
493	00:31:24	00:31:25	What do you mean, he's innocent?
494	00:31:25	00:31:26	He confessed.
495	00:31:26	00:31:31	I screwed up, Shawn.
496	00:31:31	00:31:34	He dragged their blood through my house and took off.
497	00:31:34	00:31:37	This is bull...
498	00:31:43	00:31:46	I spent three years trying to get those memories out of my head.
499	00:31:46	00:31:51	Are you telling me it's gonna start all over again?
500	00:31:51	00:31:52	I get that. I get that, Shawn.
501	00:31:52	00:31:53	I really do.
502	00:31:53	00:31:58	And I wouldn't drag you and Danny out here if it weren't important.
503	00:31:58	00:32:00	Guffey was in your house, but probably after the fact.
504	00:32:00	00:32:02	We believe we know who actually committed the crimes.
505	00:32:02	00:32:07	And unless we find the evidence that he was in there, we'll never know for sure.
506	00:32:07	00:32:11	Mr. Curtis, your son was the only one that got out alive. He may have seen something.
507	00:32:11	00:32:14	I don't think I can go in there.
508	00:32:14	00:32:15	How can I ask my son to do it?
509	00:32:16	00:32:17	May I ask him?
510	00:32:19	00:32:21	Thank you.
511	00:32:23	00:32:24	Hi, Danny.
512	00:32:24	00:32:26	I'm Catherine.
513	00:32:26	00:32:32	I'm trying to catch the bad guy that hurt your mom and your grandma, and I could really use your help.
514	00:32:36	00:32:38	Do you think they're with God?
515	00:32:40	00:32:42	What do you think?
516	00:32:42	00:32:46	I think they're still in there.
517	00:32:49	00:32:50	Why?
518	00:32:50	00:32:54	They're waiting to fly up to heaven.
519	00:32:54	00:32:57	What are they waiting for?
520	00:32:59	00:33:02	For me to say good-bye.
521	00:33:28	00:33:30	Come on, Dad.
522	00:33:49	00:33:51	Mom had made cookies.
523	00:34:05	00:34:08	Danny, I can hear you. Put the cookie back.
524	00:34:30	00:34:32	I hid in here.
525	00:34:44	00:34:46	He's a lot bigger now.
526	00:34:46	00:34:48	Heather always said he grew fast.
527	00:34:53	00:34:56	Then there was someone at the door.
528	00:34:56	00:34:58	This is my house!
529	00:34:58	00:34:59	Mom, what's going on? Mom?
530	00:35:34	00:35:36	And then what happened, Danny?
531	00:35:36	00:35:38	I heard him eat a cookie.
532	00:35:38	00:35:42	Then he went out the back door.
533	00:35:42	00:35:44	I heard some more bangs.
534	00:35:44	00:35:51	Thought he was gone, and then he came back in through the front door, called the police.
535	00:35:53	00:35:54	Guffey.
536	00:36:02	00:36:04	You did great, buddy.
537	00:36:20	00:36:21	Say good-bye, Dad.
538	00:36:21	00:36:24	Good-bye, baby.
539	00:37:28	00:37:29	Hey, Catherine.
540	00:37:29	00:37:33	Wendy found two DNA markers from the bloody fingerprint on the cookie jar.
541	00:37:33	00:37:35	Related females-- Heather and Mary.
542	00:37:36	00:37:37	And the knife?
543	00:37:37	00:37:38	Also a match.
544	00:37:39	00:37:40	We got him, Nick.
545	00:37:41	00:37:44	AFIS hit-- Jay Finch.
546	00:38:36	00:38:39	Mr. Finch, Las Vegas Police. Put the knife down.
547	00:38:39	00:38:41	Stand back with your hands up.
548	00:38:42	00:38:44	What are you doing in my house?
549	00:38:44	00:38:45	Mr. Finch, put the knife down.
550	00:38:46	00:38:47	This is my house.
551	00:38:47	00:38:50	I'm not gonna ask you again. Put it down.
552	00:38:50	00:38:51	No...
553	00:39:22	00:39:24	Norman Bates is keeping his mother alive and well.
554	00:39:24	00:39:28	Yeah, looks like everything's still in the exact same place.
555	00:39:28	00:39:30	Including the gun.
556	00:39:33	00:39:37	He kept the gun case in here.
557	00:39:37	00:39:38	We searched everywhere the first time.
558	00:39:38	00:39:40	He ditched the gun.
559	00:40:17	00:40:19	In court, he was always writing in his notebook.
560	00:40:20	00:40:21	Now I know why.
561	00:40:33	00:40:36	Now I think I know why Finch stopped by the Curtis farm.
562	00:40:37	00:40:38	He'd been driving for days.
563	00:40:38	00:40:42	He was exhausted, disoriented.
564	00:40:42	00:40:43	He thought he was home.
565	00:40:43	00:40:44	This is my house.
566	00:40:44	00:40:46	No, you have the wrong house.
567	00:40:46	00:40:48	What are you doing in my house?
568	00:40:48	00:40:50	I'm sorry, you have the wrong house...
569	00:40:50	00:40:53	Old woman answers the door, denies him access...
570	00:40:53	00:40:55	And all Finch saw was his mom.
571	00:40:55	00:40:57	And then he saw red.
572	00:40:57	00:41:00	This is my house! Mom?
573	00:41:16	00:41:18	Do you always get what you want?
574	00:41:18	00:41:23	Clearly not, but you don't have enough tricks in your bag to get him off this time.
575	00:41:23	00:41:26	I don't take on cases I don't think I can win.
576	00:41:26	00:41:29	Hey, you really want to defend the innocent?
577	00:41:29	00:41:33	There's a guy doing life up in Carson City that could use an advocate-- Robert Guffey.
578	00:41:33	00:41:34	Might even out your karma.
579	00:41:35	00:41:37	Ah, you're worried about me.
580	00:41:37	00:41:40	Just looking to keep my faith in the court system.
581	00:41:40	00:41:41	Everyone deserves justice.
582	00:41:41	00:41:44	If not the first time around, then the second.
583	00:41:53	00:41:54	Hey.
584	00:41:54	00:41:58	My cab's here.
585	00:41:58	00:41:59	So, you're going.
586	00:41:59	00:42:02	Yeah.
587	00:42:04	00:42:06	I'll see you when you get back.
588	00:42:27	00:42:28	I'll miss you.
