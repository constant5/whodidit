1,00:00:44,00:00:46,(dog barks)
2,00:00:47,00:00:49,Hey.
3,00:00:49,00:00:51,How'd you guys get out?
4,00:01:06,00:01:07,(barking)
5,00:01:14,00:01:18,"What's the matter, boys?"
6,00:01:18,00:01:20,Easy. Hey...
7,00:01:35,00:01:37,(indistinct radio chatter)
8,00:01:37,00:01:38,(helicopter whirring)
9,00:01:38,00:01:40,(camera shutter clicking)
10,00:01:46,00:01:48,Have you been inside?
11,00:01:50,00:01:52,What have you got?
12,00:02:02,00:02:03,"There you go, Detective."
13,00:02:03,00:02:05,Thanks.
14,00:02:05,00:02:06,Little tired this morning.
15,00:02:06,00:02:07,Pulling a double.
16,00:02:07,00:02:09,"Yeah, join the club."
17,00:02:10,00:02:12,"Good morning, Catherine."
18,00:02:12,00:02:15,"Good morning, Gil."
19,00:02:16,00:02:19,"So, this is Tony Braun's house."
20,00:02:19,00:02:21,Son of Sam Braun.
21,00:02:21,00:02:24,GRISSOM: He was Steve Wynn before Steve Wynn.
22,00:02:24,00:02:26,"Oh, yeah, you bet your ass."
23,00:02:26,00:02:28,Sam came to Vegas when Vegas was dying.
24,00:02:28,00:02:31,Built three casinos in a year.
25,00:02:31,00:02:33,Had ties to Bugsy Siegel.
26,00:02:36,00:02:40,Wish I had Tony Braun's gardener working for me.
27,00:02:40,00:02:42,Guy sniffed it out from the jump.
28,00:02:42,00:02:44,Blinds were drawn shut.
29,00:02:44,00:02:45,Side gate unlocked.
30,00:02:45,00:02:46,Dogs let out.
31,00:02:46,00:02:50,"""A"" plus ""B"" plus ""C"" equals 9-1-1."
32,00:03:01,00:03:04,"All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?"
33,00:03:09,00:03:11,Chasing the dragon.
34,00:03:11,00:03:13,"A pinch of ""H."" Heat the foil."
35,00:03:13,00:03:15,Inhale the fumes.
36,00:03:19,00:03:23,With a Xanax back.
37,00:03:23,00:03:26,100 pills.
38,00:03:26,00:03:28,Prescription filled yesterday.
39,00:03:28,00:03:31,So the rumors about ol' Tony boy are true.
40,00:03:31,00:03:32,Drug overdose.
41,00:03:32,00:03:36,It sure seems that way.
42,00:03:36,00:03:39,If only life were that simple.
43,00:04:15,00:04:17,(indistinct radio chatter)
44,00:04:21,00:04:23,SIDLE: Eight rolls. Two copies.
45,00:04:23,00:04:26,Case is hot. Put a rush on it.
46,00:04:40,00:04:42,Lose an earring?
47,00:04:43,00:04:45,Looks likesomebodydid.
48,00:04:51,00:04:54,He's got adhesive residue on his wrists.
49,00:04:54,00:04:55,He was restrained.
50,00:04:55,00:04:57,Some sort of tape.
51,00:04:57,00:04:58,"Well, that would be the obvious."
52,00:04:58,00:04:59,Braun had company.
53,00:04:59,00:05:01,Welcome...
54,00:05:01,00:05:03,or unwelcome?
55,00:05:03,00:05:04,Where's the purge?
56,00:05:04,00:05:07,"Car blows its engine, there's an oil leak."
57,00:05:07,00:05:09,"A guy ODs, where's the body fluid?"
58,00:05:09,00:05:10,"Urine, vomit, excrement."
59,00:05:10,00:05:12,Did somebody clean him up?
60,00:05:16,00:05:20,SIDLE: Interesting love bites on the chest.
61,00:05:20,00:05:21,"Curious, isn't it?"
62,00:05:24,00:05:26,And he's posed.
63,00:05:27,00:05:31,When did you know this was a homicide and not an OD?
64,00:05:31,00:05:31,Initially?
65,00:05:31,00:05:32,Yeah.
66,00:05:32,00:05:34,When I saw the TV on.
67,00:05:38,00:05:39,(barks)
68,00:05:41,00:05:46,"Well, I'll tell you one thing-- if those were my dogs I wouldn't be leaving this gate open."
69,00:05:46,00:05:48,"Yeah, you're talking about a dog owner on heroin."
70,00:05:48,00:05:50,How responsible can he be?
71,00:05:50,00:05:54,Gardener said it was the first time in five years that he'd found this gate unlocked.
72,00:05:54,00:05:56,What's so different about this morning?
73,00:05:56,00:05:58,Last morning of Tony Braun's life?
74,00:05:58,00:06:06,"Well, either somebody inside the house opened it, or somebody had a key because this lock hasn't been forced."
75,00:06:06,00:06:08,There's no pry marks.
76,00:06:08,00:06:09,No metal shavings.
77,00:06:09,00:06:11,So... why was the gate open?
78,00:06:13,00:06:15,BROWN: A heroin addict's confetti.
79,00:06:16,00:06:18,Nothing like going on a binge.
80,00:06:28,00:06:30,Some black tar heroin.
81,00:06:30,00:06:34,This is the difference between a Cadillac and a Pinto.
82,00:06:34,00:06:35,How would you know?
83,00:06:35,00:06:36,It's my job.
84,00:06:36,00:06:40,"I count at least six balloons, and that's just in the bedroom."
85,00:06:40,00:06:43,The dealer must have come down the chimney.
86,00:06:43,00:06:45,It's like Christmas in July here.
87,00:06:48,00:06:51,Not that Braun even needed any more drugs.
88,00:06:51,00:06:53,"Yeah, looks like the guy had a pill for everything."
89,00:06:53,00:06:55,Can you get a print off those balloons?
90,00:06:55,00:06:58,I can get a print off the air.
91,00:07:02,00:07:03,Any luck?
92,00:07:03,00:07:06,I have gone through every garbage can in the house.
93,00:07:06,00:07:07,What about the cans outside?
94,00:07:07,00:07:09,First thing I checked. Zip.
95,00:07:24,00:07:26,(rattling)
96,00:07:54,00:07:55,(handle rattling)
97,00:08:15,00:08:16,"Hey, Doc."
98,00:08:16,00:08:19,Leg fell asleep.
99,00:08:19,00:08:20,(clicks)
100,00:08:22,00:08:25,I always wondered which one of us coroners would get to carve Tony.
101,00:08:29,00:08:34,"His lifestyle was no secret-- sex, drugs and a big bankroll."
102,00:08:34,00:08:36,No needle marks on his arms.
103,00:08:36,00:08:42,The guy plays golf; short-sleeved shirts Checked between the toes... groin area.
104,00:08:42,00:08:45,Whatever he did went up his nose.
105,00:08:45,00:08:48,His nasal cavity looks like raw hamburger.
106,00:08:53,00:08:56,These abrasions around his mouth? What?
107,00:08:56,00:08:58,Hard to shave when you're stoned?
108,00:08:58,00:08:59,Or they're pressure marks.
109,00:08:59,00:09:05,"For example, if someone places a pillow or object against someone's nose and mouth in the climate of struggle."
110,00:09:07,00:09:09,Petechial hemorrhaging?
111,00:09:09,00:09:11,Also suggestive of suffocation.
112,00:09:11,00:09:13,Not always.
113,00:09:13,00:09:17,"For as much as pathology is an absolute science, it isn't."
114,00:09:17,00:09:22,Vessels can rupture under innocent circumstances such as a violent cough.
115,00:09:22,00:09:26,"These three, circular, red marks on his chest?"
116,00:09:26,00:09:28,They're not bug bites.
117,00:09:28,00:09:37,No neurotoxins present but that's not to say some overanxious paramedic trying to save a legend's life didn't cause them in the moment.
118,00:09:37,00:09:39,CPR wasn't performed.
119,00:09:39,00:09:40,Then I don't know what they are.
120,00:09:40,00:09:43,It's hard to OD justinhalingheroin.
121,00:09:43,00:09:51,I know he was restrained which leads me to believe that someone forced him to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and Xanax.
122,00:09:51,00:09:52,(indistinct radio chatter)
123,00:09:53,00:09:54,Excuse me.
124,00:09:56,00:09:59,"Boy, are you lucky my lawyer's on a golf course."
125,00:09:59,00:10:05,"I've been standing out here, in the heat for hours, answering these stupid questions."
126,00:10:05,00:10:07,"Here's your answer, okay."
127,00:10:07,00:10:08,This is my house.
128,00:10:08,00:10:09,Okay?
129,00:10:09,00:10:12,This is half my house anyway.
130,00:10:12,00:10:14,Who's this?
131,00:10:14,00:10:15,BRASS: It's Braun's squeeze.
132,00:10:15,00:10:17,"She's an ex-stripper, too."
133,00:10:17,00:10:19,Perhaps you two met in a professional capacity.
134,00:10:19,00:10:20,These are my things...
135,00:10:20,00:10:22,"And, uh, where has she been the past 12 hours?"
136,00:10:22,00:10:23,"Uh, let's see."
137,00:10:23,00:10:25,"Oh, my God."
138,00:10:25,00:10:31,"""Out."" When Tony's drug dealer showed up, she split."
139,00:10:31,00:10:32,She slept at a friend's house.
140,00:10:32,00:10:37,She didn't like the way Tony acted when he was cruising on magic carpets.
141,00:10:37,00:10:42,"Look, you two, listen-- if anything is missing from this house I'm going to add you to my lawyer's ""to sue"" list."
142,00:10:42,00:10:45,Why don't you just put the camera away before you get arrested?
143,00:10:45,00:10:48,You can't arrest me in my own house.
144,00:10:48,00:10:50,"Right now, your house is our crime scene..."
145,00:10:52,00:10:56,and we can do whatever we want and that includes fingerprinting you.
146,00:10:56,00:10:58,Why?
147,00:10:58,00:10:59,Didn't do anything.
148,00:10:59,00:11:02,Thumb to pinkie.
149,00:11:02,00:11:04,"I just lost my boyfriend, okay?"
150,00:11:04,00:11:06,You're a woman.
151,00:11:06,00:11:09,"I'm just looking out for my end here, you know?"
152,00:11:09,00:11:11,Things start to disappear.
153,00:11:11,00:11:18,"If Tony were here right now, he'd tell you himself ""Just make sure Janine's taken care of."" That's a lawyer's call."
154,00:11:18,00:11:19,"Hey, I'm in the will."
155,00:11:20,00:11:22,Of course you are.
156,00:11:30,00:11:31,Can I help you?
157,00:11:31,00:11:32,Yeah. Is Sam Braun in?
158,00:11:32,00:11:34,He's not seeing anyone today.
159,00:11:34,00:11:38,Would you let him know that Catherine Willows is here to see him?
160,00:11:38,00:11:40,(keyboard clacking)
161,00:11:43,00:11:45,"Just one second, please."
162,00:11:58,00:11:59,Mugs?
163,00:12:10,00:12:13,I remember the first time I saw you.
164,00:12:13,00:12:15,You didn't have any clothes on.
165,00:12:15,00:12:18,"Yeah, well, that was a long time ago."
166,00:12:18,00:12:22,"I would've taken you home right then, if you had let me."
167,00:12:22,00:12:24,"I know, but you were married."
168,00:12:24,00:12:26,I was a baby.
169,00:12:26,00:12:29,It would've never worked.
170,00:12:29,00:12:32,Sam... how are you holding up?
171,00:12:32,00:12:34,"Hey, Dad, I got the press clogging up Valet."
172,00:12:34,00:12:37,"Should I call Security or just handle it, or what?"
173,00:12:37,00:12:38,I'll take care of it.
174,00:12:38,00:12:40,You go back to the pit.
175,00:12:40,00:12:42,Make sure nobody's robbing us blind.
176,00:12:44,00:12:53,"You know, back in, uh... in '67 I was in my 20s and..."
177,00:12:53,00:12:56,I was drinking in a dive in downtown Buffalo.
178,00:12:56,00:13:04,"At the end of the bar was this pro quarterback drinking double scotches, two at a time midnight to 7:00 in the morning."
179,00:13:04,00:13:07,"It's Sunday, game day, mind you."
180,00:13:07,00:13:08,So you know what I did?
181,00:13:08,00:13:10,"Called my bookie, bet against him."
182,00:13:10,00:13:13,Guess what?
183,00:13:13,00:13:18,I'll be damned if he didn't throw six touchdown passes.
184,00:13:18,00:13:20,(laughing): Yeah...
185,00:13:20,00:13:22,Sounds like Tony.
186,00:13:23,00:13:31,"You know, even when Tony was juicing he could run circles around these college, Harvard types."
187,00:13:31,00:13:33,(sniffling)
188,00:13:33,00:13:37,And I'm not saying that just because he was my kid.
189,00:13:37,00:13:47,Tony was the best damn casino exec this town has ever seen and just between you and me...
190,00:13:47,00:13:49,I couldn't hold a candle to him.
191,00:13:51,00:13:53,Now he's dead.
192,00:13:55,00:13:57,Overdose.
193,00:13:57,00:14:01,Sam...
194,00:14:01,00:14:07,The bigger the pedestal the bigger the target.
195,00:14:10,00:14:16,Nobody shoots at that target without going through me.
196,00:14:16,00:14:19,"Well, that's business."
197,00:14:19,00:14:21,What about personal?
198,00:14:25,00:14:26,What do you mean?
199,00:14:26,00:14:29,Did you ever talk to Tony about any of his girlfriends?
200,00:14:30,00:14:30,Which one?
201,00:14:31,00:14:34,"I mean, they were all trying to pick the gold out of his teeth."
202,00:14:34,00:14:35,Janine Haywood.
203,00:14:35,00:14:36,She's the worst...
204,00:14:37,00:14:39,and he loved her the most.
205,00:14:39,00:14:40,Can you believe it?
206,00:14:40,00:14:42,"Yeah, I do."
207,00:14:47,00:14:54,"If I know her type, now that she has the gold she'll be going after the silver."
208,00:15:29,00:15:31,(footsteps passing)
209,00:16:03,00:16:10,"Okay, on the left, Braun prints we got from the Coroner and on the right, gold digger prints I got from Janine Haywood."
210,00:16:10,00:16:12,Here's where it gets interesting.
211,00:16:12,00:16:14,I took six prints off this bottle.
212,00:16:14,00:16:16,And? They all belong to one person.
213,00:16:16,00:16:19,Good thing or... bad thing?
214,00:16:19,00:16:21,It's good if you're us...
215,00:16:21,00:16:23,(keyboard clacking)
216,00:16:23,00:16:25,bad if you're Janine Haywood.
217,00:16:30,00:16:32,Have you seen Brass?
218,00:16:32,00:16:34,"Not tonight, no. Why?"
219,00:16:34,00:16:35,"Oh, print off air."
220,00:16:35,00:16:37,Orange balloon.
221,00:16:37,00:16:38,Cyanoacrylate.
222,00:16:38,00:16:40,"Dead bang, drug dealer."
223,00:16:41,00:16:43,"Ooh, ooh, watch it! Evidence."
224,00:16:43,00:16:45,Where did you get it? Cracker box.
225,00:16:45,00:16:47,"It was all stuck together, muckety-muck."
226,00:16:47,00:16:51,I don't want to ruin any potential prints but I saw this TV dinner commercial and it hit me.
227,00:16:51,00:16:53,I'm going to put it in the freezer.
228,00:16:56,00:16:58,Did you try this coffee?
229,00:16:58,00:16:59,Mm-mm.
230,00:16:59,00:17:01,The last cup I had tasted like motor oil.
231,00:17:01,00:17:03,"Oh, don't touch it. That's my pot!"
232,00:17:05,00:17:06,Your pot?
233,00:17:06,00:17:08,"Yeah, you know, from my own private stash."
234,00:17:08,00:17:10,Blue Hawaiian-- $40 a pound.
235,00:17:10,00:17:14,Only grown a couple times a year on the Big Island hand-picked to perfection.
236,00:17:15,00:17:16,Good.
237,00:17:16,00:17:18,You're using my water so I guess that makes it community coffee.
238,00:17:18,00:17:19,"You want a cup, Nick?"
239,00:17:19,00:17:21,"No, thanks."
240,00:17:21,00:17:22,What's the matter with your leg?
241,00:17:22,00:17:23,"I don't know, man."
242,00:17:23,00:17:26,Something back at that house must have bit me.
243,00:17:26,00:17:29,"Oh, is that alcohol on a bug bite?"
244,00:17:29,00:17:31,"That's like butter on burns, man."
245,00:17:31,00:17:33,Wives' tale.
246,00:17:33,00:17:35,"Yeah, this is the guy who told me to put hemorrhoid cream on my acne."
247,00:17:36,00:17:38,"It worked, didn't it?"
248,00:17:41,00:17:43,This is pretty good.
249,00:17:44,00:17:48,Let me see the bite before you get gangrene.
250,00:17:48,00:17:49,Chigger bite. Yeah?
251,00:17:50,00:17:52,Probably picked it up walking through the ferns in Braun's backyard.
252,00:17:53,00:17:54,See if Catherine's got some clear nail polish.
253,00:17:54,00:17:56,"It'll seal it off from the air, keep it from itching."
254,00:17:58,00:17:59,What happened with that doggy door?
255,00:18:00,00:18:02,Something definitely two-legged went through it.
256,00:18:02,00:18:03,Got mostly partials.
257,00:18:03,00:18:05,Print Lab's working on it now.
258,00:18:05,00:18:07,Be sure to check it against Janine Haywood's prints.
259,00:18:09,00:18:11,Braun's stomach contents.
260,00:18:11,00:18:13,No food.
261,00:18:13,00:18:14,Plenty of drugs.
262,00:18:14,00:18:15,Xanax?
263,00:18:15,00:18:16,And heroin.
264,00:18:16,00:18:17,I thought he inhaled it.
265,00:18:17,00:18:19,Inhaled and ingested.
266,00:18:19,00:18:20,He ate it?
267,00:18:20,00:18:21,Got there somehow.
268,00:18:21,00:18:24,Where are all the undissolved pills?
269,00:18:24,00:18:25,Didn't find any.
270,00:18:25,00:18:29,"Most OD's die before digestion's complete, right?"
271,00:18:29,00:18:34,"My guess, someone mashed up the Xanax dissolved them in red wine, which I did find."
272,00:18:34,00:18:38,"Okay, so what do we know that we can write home about?"
273,00:18:38,00:18:44,"Well, Braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means he was probably meek as a lamb."
274,00:18:44,00:18:47,Wouldn't have taken much to bind his hands with duct tape.
275,00:18:47,00:18:49,And make him drink hemlock.
276,00:18:49,00:18:54,It's a lot easier to pour liquid down a guy's throat than it is to make him swallow 100 pills.
277,00:18:54,00:18:56,It wasn't 100 pills.
278,00:18:56,00:18:57,How many?
279,00:18:58,00:19:00,"Educated, unofficial guess: No more than 50."
280,00:19:06,00:19:08,"Based on your pupes, I could take you in right now."
281,00:19:08,00:19:10,"Hey, man, I'm in mourning."
282,00:19:10,00:19:11,It's tears you see.
283,00:19:11,00:19:12,I lost a customer.
284,00:19:12,00:19:15,"It's like losing my job, kind of."
285,00:19:15,00:19:16,You're Braun's grocery store.
286,00:19:16,00:19:18,But I deliver.
287,00:19:18,00:19:19,When did you last deliver?
288,00:19:19,00:19:21,Night before he croaked.
289,00:19:21,00:19:23,About 9:00-- ask his woman.
290,00:19:23,00:19:25,"She's fine, too."
291,00:19:25,00:19:27,"Well, she told us as soon as you got there, she left."
292,00:19:27,00:19:29,"Oh, she didn't go that fast."
293,00:19:29,00:19:33,"I dropped off some balloons Braun paid me, she gave me a tip."
294,00:19:33,00:19:35,"What, shave the soul patch?"
295,00:19:35,00:19:37,(laughs)
296,00:19:37,00:19:38,No.
297,00:19:38,00:19:40,30 Xanadus.
298,00:19:40,00:19:41,Xanax?
299,00:19:41,00:19:43,I told you I dropped them down the bathroom sink.
300,00:19:43,00:19:46,First time I heard that.
301,00:19:46,00:19:53,"Look, I took two gave Tony two and I accidentally dropped 15 or 20 down the sink."
302,00:19:53,00:19:55,It was an accident.
303,00:19:55,00:19:56,"You know, an accident?"
304,00:19:56,00:19:58,Haven't you ever spilled a drink?
305,00:19:59,00:20:00,Not lately.
306,00:20:00,00:20:02,We found 50 Xanax in Tony's stomach.
307,00:20:02,00:20:04,Don't pin that on me. I'd left.
308,00:20:04,00:20:07,I'll tell you what you left-- your fingerprints all over the prescription bottle.
309,00:20:07,00:20:14,I went to the pharmacy waited in line picked up the prescription signed for it brought it back to the house.
310,00:20:14,00:20:18,Tony did nothing for himself except work and get high.
311,00:20:18,00:20:20,"Got you a brand-new Mercedes, didn't it?"
312,00:20:20,00:20:21,"Yes, it did."
313,00:20:21,00:20:25,"And it'll buy me the dress I wear at Tony's funeral, too."
314,00:20:25,00:20:28,"Look, when you left your half a house where did you go?"
315,00:20:28,00:20:29,A friend's.
316,00:20:29,00:20:30,"Well, let's get her on the line."
317,00:20:30,00:20:32,She's out of town.
318,00:20:32,00:20:34,Let me guess-- she's incommunicado.
319,00:20:34,00:20:36,That means you can't reach her?
320,00:20:36,00:20:38,Yeah.
321,00:20:40,00:20:42,"Oh, mind the dummy."
322,00:20:44,00:20:45,"It's been 24 minutes, Greg."
323,00:20:45,00:20:46,When's this thing going to be done?
324,00:20:46,00:20:49,"Well, with all due respect, sir, it's not a baked potato."
325,00:20:49,00:20:55,It's Braun's blood and with all the impurities in his system it might take a little extra time.
326,00:20:55,00:20:57,Did I ever tell you I used to live in New York?
327,00:20:57,00:21:00,Is this going to be a short story or a novel?
328,00:21:00,00:21:02,(machine beeps) Excuse me.
329,00:21:03,00:21:05,"You know, heroin has a nine-minute half-life."
330,00:21:05,00:21:07,"After that, it metabolizes into morphine."
331,00:21:07,00:21:09,What's the six-MAM count?
332,00:21:09,00:21:11,158 nanograms per mil.
333,00:21:11,00:21:13,Definitely not lethal.
334,00:21:13,00:21:14,The same with your Xanax.
335,00:21:14,00:21:17,"Quarter-mil tabs, 100 micrograms per liter."
336,00:21:17,00:21:18,"Again, not lethal."
337,00:21:18,00:21:21,There's addicts walking around Times Square with more drugs in their system.
338,00:21:21,00:21:24,So Braun should still be walking around.
339,00:21:27,00:21:31,And the point of your New York story was...?
340,00:21:31,00:21:36,"Oh, I was just going to tell you about another way to take heroin-- a suppository up the coolee."
341,00:21:36,00:21:38,"You just stand on your head, and then you let gravity..."
342,00:21:40,00:21:42,Forget it.
343,00:21:49,00:21:52,Braun didn't die of a drug overdose accidental or otherwise.
344,00:21:52,00:21:55,I figured. So why'd I bring the dummy?
345,00:21:58,00:22:00,Braun's shirt.
346,00:22:00,00:22:02,Robbins opened him up.
347,00:22:02,00:22:03,His lungs were compressed.
348,00:22:03,00:22:10,Remember Burke and Hare the two 19th century Scottish body snatchers who made a living intoxicating innocent victims and suffocating them?
349,00:22:10,00:22:12,Sold their cadavers to teaching hospitals?
350,00:22:12,00:22:16,"Got away with it, too, until a medical student discovered his fiancee on a slab."
351,00:22:16,00:22:20,Is this part of the Sherlock Holmes Fan Club kit?
352,00:22:20,00:22:25,Janine Haywood said that she left the house when the drug dealer arrived.
353,00:22:25,00:22:27,I think she came back.
354,00:22:27,00:22:31,So Braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then.
355,00:22:33,00:22:37,Would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up 50 pills...
356,00:22:39,00:22:43,and force-feed him a Xanax cocktail.
357,00:22:43,00:22:47,So everything was going great until the gardener showed up.
358,00:22:47,00:22:49,Then I think her plan turned to panic.
359,00:22:49,00:22:53,It takes time to OD-- time Janine didn't have.
360,00:22:56,00:23:01,"Burke would kneel on his victim's chest, right covering their mouth and nostrils."
361,00:23:01,00:23:07,"But when you're doing drugs you're a slob and when you're being manhandled, you're even sloppier."
362,00:23:09,00:23:11,Like this.
363,00:23:18,00:23:20,He was Burked.
364,00:23:20,00:23:21,(phone ringing)
365,00:23:24,00:23:26,Hello.
366,00:23:26,00:23:27,(staticky voice)
367,00:23:28,00:23:30,Where?
368,00:23:30,00:23:32,"Brass, you're breaking up."
369,00:23:35,00:23:38,"Said he was in Blue Diamond, digging something up."
370,00:23:38,00:23:40,(sirens wailing)
371,00:24:04,00:24:07,"Hey... Hey, what's going on?"
372,00:24:07,00:24:09,Anybody ever tell you to call before you dig?
373,00:24:09,00:24:11,I got permission to be here.
374,00:24:13,00:24:14,From who?
375,00:24:14,00:24:16,A dead man?
376,00:24:16,00:24:17,You got a name?
377,00:24:17,00:24:19,My name's Curt Ritten.
378,00:24:19,00:24:22,"Look, Tony Braun was a friend of mine, right?"
379,00:24:22,00:24:23,This is his property.
380,00:24:23,00:24:25,He calls me about a month ago.
381,00:24:25,00:24:27,"He says ""If anything should happen to me, you start digging."
382,00:24:27,00:24:32,"You take care of what's mine at all costs."" That's what I'm doing."
383,00:24:32,00:24:33,BRASS: Do me a favor.
384,00:24:33,00:24:35,Put down the shovel.
385,00:24:35,00:24:37,Okay.
386,00:24:37,00:24:38,Stand over there.
387,00:24:38,00:24:39,Okay.
388,00:24:39,00:24:41,Maybe Janine had a helper.
389,00:24:44,00:24:48,"Hey, guys, you might want to check out the basement."
390,00:25:42,00:25:49,"""A sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night."" That's a lot of motive."
391,00:25:52,00:25:54,And a lot of silver.
392,00:26:31,00:26:35,"Okay, three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by Curt Ritten."
393,00:26:35,00:26:36,Nice.
394,00:26:36,00:26:39,Let's see if that's where my print came from.
395,00:26:39,00:26:40,No match!
396,00:26:40,00:26:42,"Oh, listen to you."
397,00:26:42,00:26:48,Would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth?
398,00:26:48,00:26:49,Let me ask you something.
399,00:26:49,00:26:53,"Braun collected silver-- coins, bullion-- 23 tons of it."
400,00:26:53,00:26:55,Why bury it in Blue Diamond?
401,00:26:55,00:26:57,'Cause he was smart.
402,00:26:57,00:27:14,In the past 20 years the value of silver's gone to nothing and a commodity broker's going to charge you a storage fee per troy ounce and there's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year and that's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee.
403,00:27:14,00:27:17,What good's collecting silver coupons when you're dead?
404,00:27:17,00:27:18,Depends on who's doing the clipping.
405,00:27:20,00:27:22,"Oh, we got a positive association."
406,00:27:22,00:27:24,Roll to tape.
407,00:27:24,00:27:26,Curt to Tony.
408,00:27:28,00:27:29,You arresting me for digging?
409,00:27:29,00:27:32,"No, burglary, theft and conspiracy, to start."
410,00:27:32,00:27:36,Tony asked me to move his silver collection up to his ranch in Wyoming.
411,00:27:36,00:27:37,I'm doing what I was told.
412,00:27:37,00:27:38,Mr. Ritten...
413,00:27:38,00:27:44,it appears that we may have physical evidence connecting you to the murder of Tony Braun.
414,00:27:44,00:27:46,"Look, I had nothing to do with the drugs."
415,00:27:46,00:27:50,"I swear to you, I haven't messed around with that stuff in a long time."
416,00:27:50,00:27:54,"I was always telling Tony, as a friend to get off of it, to walk away."
417,00:27:54,00:27:56,How'd you know where the silver was buried?
418,00:27:56,00:27:57,Because I built the vault for him.
419,00:27:57,00:27:59,I'm a contractor. That's what I do.
420,00:27:59,00:28:00,Ever work on his house?
421,00:28:00,00:28:01,No.
422,00:28:01,00:28:05,We did... we did talk about me building a basement for him once.
423,00:28:06,00:28:07,It never got off the ground.
424,00:28:07,00:28:09,"Oh, so, you've been to his house?"
425,00:28:09,00:28:10,We were friends.
426,00:28:10,00:28:12,I've been to his house plenty of times.
427,00:28:12,00:28:13,I was there a couple weeks ago.
428,00:28:13,00:28:15,We were watching the Notre Dame game together.
429,00:28:15,00:28:17,Did you ever leave anything there?
430,00:28:17,00:28:19,Did you ever bring anything over to his house?
431,00:28:19,00:28:24,"Yeah, I brought a six-pack and some chips-- sour cream."
432,00:28:24,00:28:26,"Tools of the trade, Curt."
433,00:28:26,00:28:29,"Construction items-- hammer, duct tape?"
434,00:28:29,00:28:30,No.
435,00:28:31,00:28:32,Why would I do that?
436,00:28:32,00:28:34,I got no idea what you're talking about.
437,00:28:34,00:28:38,"Yeah, well, whatever you don't tell us, we'll find it."
438,00:28:46,00:28:48,That's the quickest warrant I ever got.
439,00:28:48,00:28:51,Yep. Braun family. Long arms.
440,00:28:55,00:28:59,I thought you said that Ritten's wife lives in Carson City.
441,00:28:59,00:29:00,She does.
442,00:29:00,00:29:01,They both do.
443,00:29:01,00:29:04,He just stays here when he's working.
444,00:29:04,00:29:06,Or digging up silver.
445,00:29:15,00:29:17,(shower running)
446,00:29:21,00:29:23,Mrs. Ritten?
447,00:29:24,00:29:26,Criminalistics.
448,00:29:30,00:29:31,VEGA: Police officer.
449,00:29:37,00:29:39,Geez!
450,00:29:39,00:29:41,You scared me.
451,00:29:41,00:29:42,How'd you get in here?
452,00:29:42,00:29:45,I don't have to ask youthat question.
453,00:29:45,00:29:46,"How can this be, Mandy?"
454,00:29:46,00:29:48,We found the duct tape in the guy's truck.
455,00:29:48,00:29:51,SIDLE: You're telling us the prints on that tape aren't his or hers?
456,00:29:51,00:29:56,"Well, if their names are Curt Ritten and Janine Haywood the answer's, ""No, it's not their prints."" This is ridiculous."
457,00:29:56,00:29:57,This thing must have a virus.
458,00:29:57,00:29:59,Maybe you have the wrong suspects.
459,00:29:59,00:30:01,"Well, that's easy for you to say."
460,00:30:01,00:30:05,"All you do is scan prints all day and hit ""enter."" Look, I'm not your beast of burden."
461,00:30:05,00:30:07,"Sara, this is your thing."
462,00:30:07,00:30:10,Mandy... give me something dandy.
463,00:30:10,00:30:12,I'll give you something dandy.
464,00:30:12,00:30:13,Your doggie-door prints.
465,00:30:14,00:30:17,"Good-bye, I have to go on a break now."
466,00:30:21,00:30:22,See what I mean?
467,00:30:22,00:30:23,"Your prints came back unknown, too?"
468,00:30:23,00:30:25,No.
469,00:30:25,00:30:27,Came back Walt Braun.
470,00:30:27,00:30:28,Who is he?
471,00:30:28,00:30:30,He's Tony Braun's brother.
472,00:30:30,00:30:35,He's a pit boss at the Tangiers which is why his prints were on file-- gaming card.
473,00:30:35,00:30:36,He's family.
474,00:30:36,00:30:39,Why's he using the doggie door and not the front door?
475,00:30:39,00:30:40,(chuckling): Go figure.
476,00:30:40,00:30:44,The more evidence that shows up the more this case doesn't make sense.
477,00:30:44,00:30:48,We got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the duct tape.
478,00:30:48,00:30:50,Or on the doggie door...
479,00:30:50,00:30:51,but the brother's are.
480,00:30:51,00:30:52,Mm-hmm.
481,00:30:52,00:30:53,"So, call the print lab."
482,00:30:53,00:30:54,It's been done.
483,00:30:54,00:30:56,They're not Walt Braun's prints on the tape.
484,00:30:57,00:30:58,Came back unknown.
485,00:30:59,00:31:00,Hey.
486,00:31:00,00:31:03,I've got Detective Vega rounding up Walt Braun.
487,00:31:03,00:31:07,"Apparently, this Janine Haywood really got around."
488,00:31:07,00:31:13,"When she wasn't at Braun's house playing girlfriend, she's over at ""Vault Boy's"" flat playing mistress..."
489,00:31:13,00:31:16,which gives neither of them a credible alibi.
490,00:31:16,00:31:19,Flimsy alibis don't prove murder.
491,00:31:19,00:31:20,What else have we got?
492,00:31:20,00:31:21,Nothing probative.
493,00:31:21,00:31:23,BRASS: Then I let the girlfriend go.
494,00:31:23,00:31:26,Curt Ritten goes back to lock-up until he posts bail.
495,00:31:26,00:31:27,"Look, forget Curt."
496,00:31:27,00:31:29,Forget Janine. Forget the suspects.
497,00:31:29,00:31:30,It's simple.
498,00:31:30,00:31:36,We got to figure out how a piece of duct tape from a roll we found in Curt Ritten's truck ended up wrapped around the wrists of our victim.
499,00:31:36,00:31:38,Without Curt's prints on it.
500,00:31:39,00:31:40,(speaking indistinctly)
501,00:31:41,00:31:42,"Curt, we're out of here."
502,00:31:42,00:31:44,"Oh, you're going to take this, too, huh?"
503,00:31:44,00:31:46,CURT: Bonnie...
504,00:31:46,00:31:50,"I come down here with a check to bailmyhusband out and you say to him, ""We're out of here""?"
505,00:31:50,00:31:51,"No, honey, you're out of here!"
506,00:31:51,00:31:52,"CURT: Bonnie, take it easy."
507,00:31:52,00:31:53,BONNIE: Take it easy?!
508,00:31:54,00:31:55,"How many men do you need, huh?"
509,00:31:55,00:31:57,"Hey, at least I can take care of mine."
510,00:31:57,00:32:02,"I've stuck by you through the bankruptcies the flings, the lies, and I have had it, okay?"
511,00:32:02,00:32:03,"So, you choose."
512,00:32:03,00:32:04,Me or her?
513,00:32:04,00:32:07,"Sorry, Janine."
514,00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah...
515,00:32:08,00:32:10,Heard that before.
516,00:32:11,00:32:13,JANINE: Call me.
517,00:32:13,00:32:16,BRASS: Bail processing is this way.
518,00:32:24,00:32:25,Been there.
519,00:32:25,00:32:28,MAN: You came down here to ask me about a doggie door?
520,00:32:28,00:32:30,I could've just told you over the phone.
521,00:32:30,00:32:31,It's a quirk.
522,00:32:31,00:32:34,I always like to discuss fingerprints in person.
523,00:32:34,00:32:35,Hmm. Tony and I went to dinner.
524,00:32:35,00:32:36,How long ago?
525,00:32:36,00:32:38,A while back.
526,00:32:38,00:32:40,Be more specific.
527,00:32:40,00:32:41,"Uh, about a month and a half ago."
528,00:32:41,00:32:46,We ate at Piero's talked a little business-- I dropped him off.
529,00:32:46,00:32:48,TONY: Walt...
530,00:32:48,00:32:49,(no audio)
531,00:32:49,00:32:50,My key still works here.
532,00:32:50,00:32:53,How come it doesn't work on the front door?
533,00:32:53,00:32:54,I changed the locks.
534,00:32:54,00:33:00,"WALT: And, so, I used the doggie door walked through the house, opened the door, let Tony in."
535,00:33:00,00:33:03,Guy with that kind of money doesn't have a security alarm?
536,00:33:03,00:33:05,When you're a Braun there's nothing you can't replace.
537,00:33:05,00:33:08,You can't replace your brother.
538,00:33:08,00:33:11,What's the matter with your leg?
539,00:33:11,00:33:13,I don't know. Something must've bit me.
540,00:33:13,00:33:15,Mind if I take a look?
541,00:33:15,00:33:16,"What are you, a dermatologist?"
542,00:33:16,00:33:18,"I'm an entomologist, actually."
543,00:33:18,00:33:20,I-I know all about bugs.
544,00:33:20,00:33:21,Sure.
545,00:33:21,00:33:23,Can you tell me what to put on it?
546,00:33:23,00:33:24,It's killing me.
547,00:33:24,00:33:26,Chigger bites.
548,00:33:27,00:33:31,"You might want to try some nail polish, keep it from itching."
549,00:33:31,00:33:35,Would you mind if I took a photograph for my bite collection?
550,00:33:35,00:33:37,Whatever rubs your Buddha.
551,00:33:43,00:33:44,We're almost done.
552,00:33:44,00:33:47,"Mr. Braun, uh, where do you live?"
553,00:33:47,00:33:48,Shoshone Hi-Rise-- J.W. Brown Road.
554,00:33:48,00:33:50,VEGA: And you work here?
555,00:33:50,00:33:52,"Yeah, I'm a glorified pit boss."
556,00:33:52,00:33:57,"In the, uh, last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places?"
557,00:33:57,00:33:58,WALT: No.
558,00:33:58,00:34:00,My life's pretty routine.
559,00:34:01,00:34:05,It might just get a little more routine.
560,00:34:10,00:34:12,"GRISSOM: Nick, I need your leg."
561,00:34:12,00:34:13,Show me your bite.
562,00:34:13,00:34:15,"Oh, it's no worries. I got some cream."
563,00:34:15,00:34:15,Hey.
564,00:34:15,00:34:17,All right.
565,00:34:17,00:34:19,"It's no big deal, really."
566,00:34:28,00:34:31,What time did you log in at the Braun house?
567,00:34:31,00:34:32,9:15 that morning.
568,00:34:32,00:34:35,How long after that did you start processing the backyard?
569,00:34:35,00:34:36,About a half hour.
570,00:34:36,00:34:39,You're not the only one with chigger bites.
571,00:34:39,00:34:41,Who is this?
572,00:34:41,00:34:42,Walt Braun.
573,00:34:42,00:34:44,It's now 9:30 at night.
574,00:34:44,00:34:47,"Approximately 36 hours ago, you were bitten."
575,00:34:47,00:34:50,Three hours earlier than that Tony Braun was murdered.
576,00:34:50,00:34:52,Chiggers run a predictable course.
577,00:34:52,00:35:05,"A chigger attaches itself to a hair follicle injects a digest enzyme into the skin which ruptures the surrounding cells allowing the chigger to suck them up leaving behind a red, itchy bump."
578,00:35:05,00:35:06,So...?
579,00:35:06,00:35:08,Walt Braun lied.
580,00:35:08,00:35:14,We now have an entomological timeline that places him at the house on the day his brother was murdered.
581,00:35:14,00:35:15,"I don't know, Boss."
582,00:35:15,00:35:22,"I mean, ask yourself the question-- are doggie-door prints and chigger bites enough to get a man for murder?"
583,00:35:33,00:35:35,What've we got?
584,00:35:35,00:35:36,"Well, I got motive."
585,00:35:36,00:35:38,"According to the family lawyer, the drug addict..."
586,00:35:38,00:35:41,"Now, Jim, that's just a little callous."
587,00:35:41,00:35:42,I'm calling it what it is.
588,00:35:42,00:35:48,I know you're friends with the family but the guy used heroin. He was a drug addict who stood in line to inherit the old man's fortune.
589,00:35:48,00:35:49,What about the brother?
590,00:35:49,00:35:51,Walt's out of the picture. Out in the cold.
591,00:35:51,00:35:52,He is? Yeah.
592,00:35:52,00:35:54,Tony promised he'd take care of him.
593,00:35:54,00:35:58,"Whatever he got, he'd split 50-50 all in..."
594,00:35:58,00:35:59,silver included...
595,00:35:59,00:36:00,up until about a month ago.
596,00:36:00,00:36:03,"But Tony changed his mind, which changed the will."
597,00:36:03,00:36:10,"WILLOWS: So, wait a second-- Janine, the stripper claims that half of everything is hers so that's actually more than just wishful thinking?"
598,00:36:10,00:36:12,Bet Walt wasn't too happy about that.
599,00:36:12,00:36:14,It's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way.
600,00:36:15,00:36:17,Curt was digging up the silver to protect Janine's interest.
601,00:36:17,00:36:20,"So, what's right in front of us that we're missing?"
602,00:36:20,00:36:21,What evidence do we have that's still open?
603,00:36:21,00:36:25,Got the references off of Walt Braun gave the samples to Greg.
604,00:36:25,00:36:31,"SIDLE: Couple of things on the list that haven't been processed yet: Tape lifts, adhesive residue, I got the earring back."
605,00:36:31,00:36:33,Where'd you find that?
606,00:36:33,00:36:34,"Living room, near the body."
607,00:36:34,00:36:36,We have to deal with that earring.
608,00:36:36,00:36:37,We got to test it against Janine.
609,00:36:37,00:36:40,"You want to swab me, go ahead but I can save you the Q-Tip."
610,00:36:40,00:36:41,That's really not my style.
611,00:36:42,00:36:43,Ms. Haywood...
612,00:36:43,00:36:45,you have pierced ears. Yeah.
613,00:36:45,00:36:47,He doesn't understand. I don't wear studs.
614,00:36:47,00:36:49,"Haven't worn studs since, like..."
615,00:36:49,00:36:51,"God, seventh grade."
616,00:36:51,00:36:52,Mm-hmm.
617,00:36:53,00:36:55,Can I see that picture?
618,00:36:55,00:36:58,Thanks. See?
619,00:36:58,00:37:01,This is an earring back. It goes to a stud earring.
620,00:37:01,00:37:03,"I don't wear studs. I'm more of, like, a dangle gal."
621,00:37:03,00:37:04,I like chandeliers. They move with you.
622,00:37:05,00:37:06,They're on wires. They don't have a back.
623,00:37:06,00:37:08,Are you finished?
624,00:37:08,00:37:10,Open your mouth.
625,00:37:13,00:37:15,Don't bite down. Wouldn't want you to swallow it.
626,00:37:15,00:37:21,GRISSOM: How about your girlfriends or Tony's girlfriends-- any of them wear studs?
627,00:37:21,00:37:24,"Look, rule number one: no women allowed in the house."
628,00:37:24,00:37:29,"Tony had a wandering eye, he had a wad of cash who needed that drama? What about the maid?"
629,00:37:29,00:37:35,"No. Rule number two: Heavyset, over 50, no makeup, no jewelry, no English."
630,00:37:35,00:37:37,Wow. You got this whole thing down don't you?
631,00:37:37,00:37:39,Yeah. This is my house.
632,00:37:39,00:37:41,I didn't do anything wrong.
633,00:37:41,00:37:43,"And I inherited Josie, and she cleans real good."
634,00:37:43,00:37:44,How often does she vacuum?
635,00:37:44,00:37:46,Every day.
636,00:37:47,00:37:48,Except on her day off.
637,00:37:48,00:37:50,Hmm. The day Tony died.
638,00:37:50,00:37:52,Hmm.
639,00:37:53,00:37:55,"Well, if the maid is as good as Janine says she is..."
640,00:37:55,00:37:57,then the earring back was lost that day.
641,00:37:59,00:38:02,"There. Well, maybe not."
642,00:38:02,00:38:03,The earring back-- not Janine's.
643,00:38:04,00:38:05,But it was in the ear of a female.
644,00:38:05,00:38:07,"So, I guess rule number one was broken."
645,00:38:07,00:38:09,There was a woman in the house.
646,00:38:09,00:38:11,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
647,00:38:11,00:38:14,Whoever's prints are on the duct tape is missing an earring back.
648,00:38:14,00:38:16,Who's the only other woman in the story?
649,00:38:16,00:38:18,She lives in Carson City.
650,00:38:18,00:38:20,She's here now. She has access to Curt's truck.
651,00:38:20,00:38:22,We saw the fight in the police department.
652,00:38:22,00:38:28,"""Hell hath no fury..."" It's not mine. I don't wear earrings."
653,00:38:28,00:38:33,"GRISSOM: It's funny, just recently I had a little education in earrings and I noticed that you have pierced ears."
654,00:38:33,00:38:34,Yeah. So what?
655,00:38:34,00:38:39,If you don't wear earrings for a while the holes will close up.
656,00:38:39,00:38:41,BRASS: Will you volunteer as a DNA sample?
657,00:38:41,00:38:44,It will confirm your story or confirm ours.
658,00:38:44,00:38:46,I'm not giving you anything.
659,00:38:46,00:38:49,"It's okay, Jim, we have enough."
660,00:38:49,00:38:51,You should let your husband rot in jail.
661,00:38:51,00:38:56,We lifted your thumbprint from the check that you posted for his bail.
662,00:38:56,00:39:01,GRISSOM: We compared it to a set of unknown prints that we found on some duct tape at the crime scene.
663,00:39:01,00:39:03,WILLOWS: Just like a pair of earrings-- identical.
664,00:39:04,00:39:06,So you were at Tony's house the morning he died.
665,00:39:06,00:39:11,Along with Walt Braun whose prints we confirmed on the doggy door.
666,00:39:21,00:39:23,(Tony groaning)
667,00:39:31,00:39:39,"GRISSOM: You know, sometimes, doing the job that we do our biggest break comes from the most innocent circumstance."
668,00:39:39,00:39:43,"It was the maid's day off, but not the gardener's."
669,00:39:43,00:39:47,That's the thing about murder you never think to have a backup plan.
670,00:39:47,00:39:50,The dogs lead him right to you...
671,00:39:50,00:39:51,(dogs barking)
672,00:39:51,00:39:53,so you had to wing it.
673,00:39:57,00:40:00,The gardener came to the window...
674,00:40:00,00:40:02,(dogs barking)
675,00:40:02,00:40:04,but he didn't see you...
676,00:40:04,00:40:07,so you removed the tape from Tony's wrists...
677,00:40:07,00:40:09,and made it look like an OD.
678,00:40:09,00:40:16,WILLOWS: What I don't get is you and Walt Braun didn't move in the same circles.
679,00:40:16,00:40:18,How'd the two of you hook up?
680,00:40:21,00:40:27,"News flash, sweetheart: Can't make a deal if you keep your mouth shut."
681,00:40:32,00:40:42,That's the thing about my father: He could never give advice but he had a million stories.
682,00:40:42,00:40:50,"""Scorpion and the Frog."" Scorpion needed to get across the creek and asked the frog for a ride."
683,00:40:51,00:41:00,"Frog says, ""I can't trust you, you're a scorpion."" Scorpion says, ""Sure you can."" Hops on the frog's back."
684,00:41:02,00:41:06,"Midway across, the scorpion stings the frog."
685,00:41:06,00:41:10,Frog looks at him.
686,00:41:10,00:41:13,"""Why would you do that?"
687,00:41:13,00:41:20,"Now we're both gonna die."" Scorpion says..."
688,00:41:23,00:41:34,"""I can't help it. I'm a scorpion."" If Tony hadn't thrown a party..."
689,00:41:34,00:41:37,the two of us would never have been standing at that bar.
690,00:41:37,00:41:39,"Hey, Janine, you're lookin' good."
691,00:41:52,00:41:54,You're looking at my brother's trophy?
692,00:41:54,00:41:57,"No, my husband's bimbo."
693,00:41:57,00:41:59,Walt Braun.
694,00:42:00,00:42:02,Bonnie Ritten.
695,00:42:03,00:42:07,And an opportunity presented itself.
696,00:42:08,00:42:14,Tony had erased you from the will and Bonnie wanted the people that hurt her to pay.
697,00:42:16,00:42:18,Ain't love grand?
698,00:42:24,00:42:27,"You know, this... this could've all been his."
699,00:42:27,00:42:29,His and Tony's.
700,00:42:30,00:42:31,It's not your fault.
701,00:42:31,00:42:33,Sure it is.
702,00:42:35,00:42:38,I committed the cardinal sin.
703,00:42:38,00:42:41,I loved one son more than the other.
704,00:42:41,00:42:44,It's human nature.
705,00:42:44,00:42:46,We can't deny our feelings.
706,00:42:46,00:42:49,But you can hide it.
707,00:42:49,00:42:51,And I didn't.

710,00:42:57,00:43:00,and one kills the other.
711,00:43:00,00:43:04,"Hey, Sam... you still got me."
712,00:43:06,00:43:08,"You know, I should've married your mother."
713,00:43:08,00:43:13,"Well, considering I was six months old when you guys lit the flame..."

716,00:43:19,00:43:21,"Just wasn't in the cards, Catherine."
717,00:43:24,00:43:27,It just wasn't in the cards.
