0	00:00:15	00:00:16	Hi!
1	00:01:37	00:01:39	Did you see anything?
2	00:01:40	00:01:42	Okay, hold on; hold on.
3	00:01:42	00:01:45	Look at me. Look at me.
4	00:01:45	00:01:46	I don't know.
5	00:01:46	00:01:48	Did you see this? Did you hear anything?
6	00:01:48	00:01:49	You just ran over there?
7	00:01:50	00:01:52	No.
8	00:01:52	00:01:54	Did you see it? (scoffs)
9	00:01:54	00:01:57	Three holes in the male, two holes in the female.
10	00:02:02	00:02:05	Five holes, one casing.
11	00:02:05	00:02:10	But with all this foot traffic, the other shells could be anywhere.
12	00:02:13	00:02:15	There's no I.D. or anything on the female.
13	00:02:15	00:02:20	But... we do have a big bulge right here.
14	00:02:28	00:02:30	Got a license.
15	00:02:30	00:02:33	Vic's name is Sung Bang.
16	00:02:37	00:02:41	Apparently, his day started a lot better than it ended.
17	00:02:41	00:02:43	Prison release forms.
18	00:02:43	00:02:47	Spent six months in Jean for repeat DUIs.
19	00:02:47	00:02:49	Walked out today.
20	00:02:49	00:02:52	It's weird-- the female vic doesn't even have a lint in her pocket.
21	00:02:52	00:02:54	This guy, it's an I.D. orgasm.
22	00:02:55	00:02:56	Overload.
23	00:02:56	00:02:58	I meant I.D. overload.
24	00:03:01	00:03:04	Must have been at least a dozen people within ten feet of the victims.
25	00:03:04	00:03:10	Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna learn much from this crowd. Tells me we're probably looking for a Korean.
26	00:03:10	00:03:17	If the killer had been black, white or brown, we'd already have height, weight hair and tattoos.
27	00:03:17	00:03:19	Smells like a gang hit.
28	00:03:30	00:03:35	I found a pair of kid's sunglasses with blood spatter all over them.
29	00:03:35	00:03:38	Prints and smudges.
30	00:03:41	00:03:43	He must have been standing right here.
31	00:03:43	00:03:45	He would have seen everything.
32	00:03:45	00:03:47	If it was me, I would've run.
33	00:03:47	00:03:48	The killer could've taken him.
34	00:03:48	00:03:54	Either way, he's missing, and we have to find this child before something happens to him.
35	00:04:26	00:04:31	The incident shattered the calm in Koreatown, where partiers were celebrating until the violence broke out.
36	00:04:31	00:04:36	Officers have been unable to identify the female victim, and that's holding things up.
37	00:04:37	00:04:46	The investigators say they're hampered by a language barrier, and their job is also complicated by the fact that many of the partygoers distrust or even fear the police.
38	00:05:05	00:05:07	I don't know, I don't know.
39	00:05:07	00:05:09	That is all I know.
40	00:05:09	00:05:10	All right, thanks. You're free to go.
41	00:05:11	00:05:12	Next.
42	00:05:16	00:05:19	How's it going?
43	00:05:27	00:05:32	Sir, how close were you standing to the victims?
44	00:05:32	00:05:35	If you speak English, now would be a good time to start.
45	00:05:36	00:05:41	If it's gonna get me out of here quicker, I'll be William freakin' Shakespeare.
46	00:05:41	00:05:46	From what I understand, the Korean culture's very big on respect.
47	00:05:49	00:05:52	Yeah.
48	00:05:55	00:06:01	So how about giving maximum respect to the two people who were murdered and tell me what you saw?
49	00:06:03	00:06:04	You know, I like your style.
50	00:06:04	00:06:12	Yeah, I give you all the forensics you want-- a Q-Tip in the mouth; you can have my ass prints if you want, but don't ask me what happened.
51	00:06:12	00:06:15	It's not my business, so I shouldn't be flapping about it.
52	00:06:16	00:06:20	So you think that's real, too, letting murderers run free?
53	00:06:22	00:06:24	We know it's a gang thing.
54	00:06:26	00:06:28	You don't need me then, do you?
55	00:06:31	00:06:35	Male C.O.D. is exsanguinations due to multiple GSWs.
56	00:06:35	00:06:36	Same with the female.
57	00:06:36	00:06:39	Exsanguinations due to multiple GSWs.
58	00:06:39	00:06:42	The bullets in the male were cannelured.
59	00:06:42	00:06:44	He was shot with a revolver.
60	00:06:44	00:06:47	Female was shot twice with a semiautomatic.
61	00:06:47	00:06:49	Two guns, two killers?
62	00:06:49	00:06:52	Or one killer, two guns, gangsta style.
63	00:06:52	00:06:59	Well, his shots seem fairly straight and level, but it looks like the bullets entered her at a much steeper trajectory.
64	00:06:59	00:07:02	Yeah, approximately 20 degrees up, front to back.
65	00:07:02	00:07:12	So, what, He gets gunned down, she's terrified, tries to flee and then falls down  as she's shot, exaggerating the trajectory?
66	00:07:15	00:07:16	Could be a drug thing.
67	00:07:18	00:07:21	She's got the needle marks to prove it.
68	00:07:23	00:07:25	I sent blood and tissue samples to Tox.
69	00:07:28	00:07:31	This is an odd-looking scar...
70	00:07:31	00:07:33	on both eyelids.
71	00:07:33	00:07:34	Could be cosmetic surgery.
72	00:07:35	00:07:38	She's a little young for a facelift, don't you think?
73	00:07:38	00:07:44	Attractive girl on drugs, on the street with an ex-con and no I.D.
74	00:07:44	00:07:46	Sounds like a street hooker.
75	00:07:46	00:07:50	Yeah, but not someone who pays for plastic surgery.
76	00:07:50	00:07:54	Well, maybe it's a business investment, courtesy of her pimp.
77	00:07:54	00:07:59	So he's unmarried with no children and apart from the DUIs, clean record.
78	00:07:59	00:08:01	No known gang affiliation.
79	00:08:02	00:08:11	He was at Dempsey's Department Store a half an hour before he was shot and was released from Jean an hour before that.
80	00:08:11	00:08:15	Jean is a 45-minute bus ride to Vegas.
81	00:08:15	00:08:22	So this guy gets out of jail and in under the running time of The Godfather, he's dead.
82	00:08:24	00:08:27	Well, a lot of people die at the end of Godfather.
83	00:08:33	00:08:35	Riley ran all the bullets and casings from the scene.
84	00:08:35	00:08:36	Gun is clean.
85	00:08:37	00:08:38	Any I.D. on the female?
86	00:08:38	00:08:41	No, but she had a blepharoplasty.
87	00:08:41	00:08:45	Asian eyelid procedure fairly common in Korea and apparently catching on here, too.
88	00:08:45	00:08:48	Brass passed the vic's photo around Makeover Town.
89	00:08:48	00:08:50	Makeover Town? L.A.?
90	00:08:50	00:08:53	No, it's a block of plastic surgeons in our Koreatown.
91	00:08:53	00:08:55	Our Koreatown is a block.
92	00:08:55	00:08:57	Maybe that's why he was able to find a doctor.
93	00:08:57	00:09:00	I didn't know her name.
94	00:09:00	00:09:04	You put a woman under anesthesia, you cut her open, and you don't know her name?
95	00:09:04	00:09:06	Sir, she was not an ordinary client.
96	00:09:06	00:09:15	So they forced you at gunpoint to perform eye surgery on women in a procedure that Westernizes their appearance, resulting in an effect called round eyes?
97	00:09:15	00:09:20	Ever since Jackie Chan got his eyes done, the surgery's been very popular.
98	00:09:20	00:09:22	And then they just left?
99	00:09:22	00:09:26	Yes, after they forced me to agree to give them 15% of my profits.
100	00:09:26	00:09:27	I'm gonna need names, Doctor.
101	00:09:27	00:09:29	They didn't leave any business cards.
102	00:09:32	00:09:35	I think they belong to a group called The KD.
103	00:09:35	00:09:36	The Kkangpae Dragons.
104	00:09:36	00:09:38	I never heard of.
105	00:09:38	00:09:40	And there isn't much in Vegas I haven't heard of.
106	00:09:40	00:09:41	A new outfit.
107	00:09:41	00:09:45	They don't have any tattoos or drive lowriders or spray graffiti.
108	00:09:45	00:09:47	They don't even sell drugs.
109	00:09:47	00:09:51	So what do they do, just force plastic surgeons to operate on their prostitutes?
110	00:09:51	00:09:54	Extortion is their trade. They just take. Right.
111	00:09:54	00:09:56	And they take from their own because they know their own.
112	00:09:56	00:09:58	They know that their own won't turn them in.
113	00:09:58	00:10:00	Well, you're very courageous to come in and report this.
114	00:10:00	00:10:02	Why won't others come forward?
115	00:10:02	00:10:05	You want a bunch of immigrants to come to the police?
116	00:10:05	00:10:10	Why don't you protect them the way you protect the tourists on the Strip and the big shots in Anthem and Seven Hills?
117	00:10:10	00:10:12	Save the stump speech for when you run for mayor.
118	00:10:12	00:10:13	I'll vote for you.
119	00:10:14	00:10:15	Are you still paying extortion?
120	00:10:15	00:10:17	No, not anymore.
121	00:10:17	00:10:20	Six months ago, I joined an HMO.
122	00:10:20	00:10:24	And they installed several security cameras around my building.
123	00:10:24	00:10:26	The Dragons don't like to be seen.
124	00:10:26	00:10:28	They prefer to be invisible.
125	00:10:28	00:10:30	Excuse me, Captain.
126	00:10:30	00:10:31	We got a surveillance hit.
127	00:10:31	00:10:34	CSI said there were no surveillance cameras at the crime scene.
128	00:10:34	00:10:37	Hit didn't come from CSI.
129	00:10:37	00:10:43	One of my video analysts caught news of your double in Koreatown and recognized the male vic while scanning one of our video feeds.
130	00:10:43	00:10:46	from a unrelated shoplifting investigation.
131	00:10:46	00:10:47	Wow.
132	00:10:47	00:10:49	Video analyst?
133	00:10:49	00:10:52	Yeah, why? What do you call them?
134	00:11:02	00:11:04	Forensic Services.
135	00:11:09	00:11:12	Must have a hell of a shoplifting problem.
136	00:11:12	00:11:19	We're in a high crime area, and this facility represents a corporate mission to prevent theft, fraud and personal injury in our stores.
137	00:11:19	00:11:23	You're not outsourcing that to China, too, are you?
138	00:11:23	00:11:25	All right, Artie, bring it up.
139	00:11:25	00:11:28	You know, what's your solve rate on property crime these days?
140	00:11:28	00:11:30	One in ten? One in 20?
141	00:11:30	00:11:33	Hey, you didn't tell me we were going to have a quiz.
142	00:11:33	00:11:34	You know, we nail 93%.
143	00:11:34	00:11:40	Nationwide, Dempsey's Forensic Services has put three fugitives behind bars; we're going to be in 300 locations by next summer.
144	00:11:40	00:11:46	Hey, look, you know, if it, uh, if it's legal and makes my job easier, I'm all for it.
145	00:11:46	00:11:48	There's our guy.
146	00:11:48	00:11:49	Sung Bang.
147	00:11:49	00:11:51	Archie...
148	00:11:51	00:11:55	Artie... could you enhance the image of the boy?
149	00:11:58	00:11:59	Wow.
150	00:11:59	00:12:01	You've got some really great cameras.
151	00:12:01	00:12:03	Good as any on the Strip.
152	00:12:03	00:12:06	In fact, our crime lab is better equipped than most in the country.
153	00:12:06	00:12:09	Now, that's a crime.
154	00:12:09	00:12:11	We're going to need that toy.
155	00:12:11	00:12:12	Mindy?
156	00:12:12	00:12:13	The toy and the lift.
157	00:12:15	00:12:18	We didn't bother running it through AFIS.
158	00:12:18	00:12:21	He's obviously under 14 years old, so he wouldn't be in the database.
159	00:12:21	00:12:23	We, uh, licensed it from the Feds.
160	00:12:23	00:12:25	Loupe, please.
161	00:12:25	00:12:27	Thank you.
162	00:12:34	00:12:36	This is the same boy.
163	00:12:36	00:12:37	Is that the vic's kid?
164	00:12:37	00:12:41	From everything we know, Sung Bang had no children.
165	00:12:41	00:12:45	He sure looks like the happy dad to me.
166	00:12:50	00:12:54	This is the last footage of Sung Bang leaving Dempsey's Department Store.
167	00:12:54	00:12:55	Who's the kid?
168	00:12:55	00:12:57	The boy's name is Park Bang.
169	00:12:57	00:12:59	Sung is his uncle.
170	00:12:59	00:13:01	You positive?
171	00:13:01	00:13:03	I've been Park's CPS investigator for over two years.
172	00:13:03	00:13:05	I know what he looks like.
173	00:13:05	00:13:08	Okay. Who's this?
174	00:13:08	00:13:09	Uh...
175	00:13:09	00:13:11	Here. Come over in the light.
176	00:13:17	00:13:20	Her name's Kora Sil.
177	00:13:20	00:13:21	Park's mother.
178	00:13:22	00:13:23	Poor boy has lost everyone.
179	00:13:24	00:13:25	What about his father? Dead.
180	00:13:25	00:13:28	He was supposedly some big gangster here and in Korea.
181	00:13:28	00:13:30	The Kkangpae Dragons?
182	00:13:30	00:13:33	I don't know. I never actually met him.
183	00:13:33	00:13:34	He died of AIDS a few years ago.
184	00:13:35	00:13:37	That's when Sung took over the father role.
185	00:13:37	00:13:40	In fact, it was Sung who notified us about Kora's drug use.
186	00:13:40	00:13:43	He loved that boy.
187	00:13:43	00:13:45	You know, CSI did a tox panel on the mother.
188	00:13:45	00:13:46	Came back positive for HIV.
189	00:13:46	00:13:48	What's the boy's status? Do you know?
190	00:13:48	00:13:50	He's also HIV positive.
191	00:13:50	00:13:54	Park's on a very strict drug regimen, so we need to find him immediately.
192	00:13:54	00:13:57	Well, I mean, the drug regimen may be the least of his problems.
193	00:13:57	00:14:02	I think the gang killed his uncle and his mother, he saw it; he may already be dead.
194	00:14:06	00:14:07	Our girl has done time.
195	00:14:07	00:14:09	Three months for prostitution.
196	00:14:09	00:14:11	Three months?
197	00:14:11	00:14:12	That's pretty harsh for Vegas.
198	00:14:12	00:14:14	Prostitution with HIV.
199	00:14:14	00:14:17	That's like pointing a gun and pulling the trigger.
200	00:14:17	00:14:18	Any last-knowns?
201	00:14:18	00:14:19	Over a dozen.
202	00:14:19	00:14:21	She's moved around a lot.
203	00:14:21	00:14:24	PD's running them down.
204	00:14:24	00:14:27	Kora Sil's Friend Agenda page.
205	00:14:27	00:14:30	Single... Born in Seoul...
206	00:14:30	00:14:34	Likes rap music... doesn't drink or smoke...
207	00:14:34	00:14:37	But likes to shoot drugs and turn tricks with HIV.
208	00:14:37	00:14:38	Well, it's always something, isn't it?
209	00:14:38	00:14:42	Let's check the IP address of the last comment she posted. Yeah.
210	00:14:49	00:14:52	Well, looks like she's using this page to score drugs.
211	00:14:52	00:14:54	Welcome to the dark side of social networking.
212	00:14:54	00:15:00	Okay. The IP address... is...
213	00:15:03	00:15:04	What a surprise.
214	00:15:04	00:15:06	Koreatown.
215	00:15:07	00:15:09	Of course I know Kora.
216	00:15:09	00:15:10	But why do you ask?
217	00:15:10	00:15:11	We're looking for her son.
218	00:15:12	00:15:13	Why would Park be here?
219	00:15:13	00:15:16	We're going to take a look around.
220	00:15:17	00:15:18	That's a field I.D.
221	00:15:18	00:15:21	We photograph every person of interest in a case.
222	00:15:21	00:15:22	It's standard procedure.
223	00:15:22	00:15:24	I have no reason to lie to you.
224	00:15:24	00:15:25	I know Park and Kora.
225	00:15:25	00:15:27	They come over to use my computer.
226	00:15:27	00:15:33	Mr. Pan, you don't strike me as the kind of guy who would have nefarious individuals in your home.
227	00:15:33	00:15:35	Captain Brass, may we talk outside?
228	00:15:35	00:15:36	No.
229	00:15:44	00:15:47	I've known Park's father his entire life.
230	00:15:47	00:15:51	We came over from Korea together, but we went in different directions.
231	00:15:51	00:15:55	But I still treat his family as my own, and if they want to use my computer, I let them.
232	00:15:55	00:15:56	There's nothing wrong with that.
233	00:15:57	00:15:58	No, I'll tell you what's wrong.
234	00:15:58	00:16:00	The young woman Kora is dead, and her son Park is missing.
235	00:16:00	00:16:04	Now, this crime happened about a block from where you live.
236	00:16:04	00:16:06	I can't believe you haven't heard about this.
237	00:16:06	00:16:10	I had no idea. I was in Phoenix on business.
238	00:16:10	00:16:12	Oh. Phoenix, huh? House is clear, sir.
239	00:16:12	00:16:14	Thanks, Kwan.
240	00:16:14	00:16:16	Do you have any idea where Park might be?
241	00:16:16	00:16:19	No. No. I don't know. I... I'm truly sorry.
242	00:16:19	00:16:22	Okay, look. Here's my card.
243	00:16:22	00:16:26	Call me if you hear or see anything that may be useful to me.
244	00:16:26	00:16:28	Thanks for your cooperation.
245	00:16:28	00:16:31	Sorry for the inconvenience.
246	00:16:36	00:16:43	Park Bang left Dempsey's Department Store 00 p.m. with a shopping bag full of stuff his uncle just bought him.
247	00:16:43	00:16:50	The shooting occurred here about a half an hour later, and that's only a couple blocks away; the uncle doesn't have a car, so...
248	00:16:50	00:16:55	they probably walked, using one of these routes.
249	00:16:58	00:17:00	What's on that receipt again?
250	00:17:00	00:17:08	Uh... T-shirt, novelty sunglasses, Crunchies, Double Fudge, Fruit Funzies and Nutty Cups. Nothing says I love you like processed sugar.
251	00:17:09	00:17:14	The only thing we found at the scene were the sunglasses.
252	00:17:14	00:17:16	Where's the rest of it?
253	00:17:20	00:17:22	Okay, we're digging through trash.
254	00:17:22	00:17:25	More specifically, anything from Dempsey's Department Store.
255	00:17:25	00:17:27	Clothing tags, assorted candy items.
256	00:17:27	00:17:32	Okay? Check the cans, the Dumpsters, sewage drains, Port-a-Potties.
257	00:17:32	00:17:34	Okay, be thorough.
258	00:17:34	00:17:35	Yeah, let's do it.
259	00:17:37	00:17:42	Remember to check along the fences, under cars.
260	00:17:42	00:17:45	These are places where evidence can hide.
261	00:17:45	00:17:47	Use your imagination.
262	00:17:47	00:17:52	I know this seems like a simple trash hunt, but it could make or break the case.
263	00:17:52	00:17:57	The sooner we find the stuff, the sooner we're going to find this kid, so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.
264	00:17:57	00:17:59	Hodges.
265	00:18:01	00:18:05	Come on, man. I know you're not nuts about the field, but I didn't bring you all the way out here to just stand around.
266	00:18:05	00:18:06	You know what I mean?
267	00:18:06	00:18:08	Can I see you for a second?
268	00:18:11	00:18:14	What?
269	00:18:14	00:18:18	You can work hard or you can work smart.
270	00:18:23	00:18:25	Can I go now?
271	00:18:35	00:18:37	LVPD! Open up!
272	00:18:47	00:18:48	Sorry to barge in on you, ma'am.
273	00:18:48	00:18:50	We're just looking for a missing little boy.
274	00:18:50	00:18:52	Gun!
275	00:18:52	00:18:53	She's got a gun!
276	00:18:53	00:18:55	Nick, she's got a gun.
277	00:18:55	00:18:56	What are you doing? Put that thing down.
278	00:18:58	00:19:00	Lady, put that gun down right now.
279	00:19:00	00:19:02	Put the gun down or we'll shoot.
280	00:19:02	00:19:03	No, we won't. Relax.
281	00:19:03	00:19:07	Ma'am, we're looking for a little boy who's in really big trouble.
282	00:19:07	00:19:09	His name is Park Bang.
283	00:19:10	00:19:11	She doesn't understand.
284	00:19:11	00:19:13	Where the hell is the translator?!
285	00:19:13	00:19:15	She understands just fine. Don't you?
286	00:19:15	00:19:16	Park Bang.
287	00:19:16	00:19:19	We just want to help him. She doesn't understand.
288	00:19:22	00:19:23	Drop the gun! Nick!
289	00:20:04	00:20:06	Riley. What's the deal?
290	00:20:07	00:20:09	(sighs) Kid's pretty weak.
291	00:20:09	00:20:13	I asked him if he remembered anything about the shootings, but he wouldn't even open his mouth.
292	00:20:13	00:20:15	Where is his CPS investigator?
293	00:20:15	00:20:16	En route.
294	00:20:16	00:20:20	You interviewed a minor without an advocate present?
295	00:20:20	00:20:23	Not officially.
296	00:20:23	00:20:25	Those regulations are there to protect the welfare of the child.
297	00:20:25	00:20:26	Don't ever do that again.
298	00:20:26	00:20:28	Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
299	00:20:28	00:20:30	I was just trying to help our case.
300	00:20:30	00:20:32	Maybe you should go back to the lab.
301	00:20:32	00:20:34	Happy to.
302	00:20:38	00:20:41	Okay, let's get that shirt off.
303	00:20:41	00:20:43	Sit up a little bit. Okay.
304	00:20:50	00:20:52	Good job.
305	00:20:57	00:20:59	Excuse me, Doctor.
306	00:20:59	00:21:02	I'm with the Las Vegas Police Department.
307	00:21:02	00:21:05	Why does this boy have a gastric tube?
308	00:21:05	00:21:08	Might be an issue with feeding.
309	00:21:08	00:21:09	Trouble swallowing, that sort of thing.
310	00:21:09	00:21:12	We'll do a chest X-ray to be sure.
311	00:21:12	00:21:14	What about this skin condition?
312	00:21:14	00:21:18	Yeah, probably a side effect of his HIV meds.
313	00:21:18	00:21:20	CPS sent his records over.
314	00:21:20	00:21:23	He's on a pretty severe regimen.
315	00:21:23	00:21:29	Why is there dried blood around the feeding tube? He could have caught it on something-- tried to pull it out.
316	00:21:29	00:21:34	Hey, kiddo, I'm going to take good care of you, don't worry.
317	00:21:43	00:21:48	She says that she was just watering her garden when she heard gunshots and people started running.
318	00:22:00	00:22:06	She took the boy in and fed him and let him play with some old toys.
319	00:22:11	00:22:15	And then the boy went to sleep like little boys should.
320	00:22:19	00:22:22	She says she was just trying to protect the boy.
321	00:22:22	00:22:24	Why'd you pull a gun on the police?
322	00:22:34	00:22:38	She says that where she comes from, people would take care of their neighbors.
323	00:22:38	00:22:41	You should've turned him over to us right away.
324	00:22:50	00:22:52	She asks why?
325	00:22:52	00:22:55	So you can cut another hole in his stomach?
326	00:22:58	00:23:00	Okay, then, how about these guys?
327	00:23:00	00:23:03	Any of these guys look familiar, huh?
328	00:23:03	00:23:05	Come on, Park, you can talk to me.
329	00:23:06	00:23:08	These people are here to help you.
330	00:23:08	00:23:15	If you see one that hurt your mommy or uncle, all you have to do is point, okay, pal?
331	00:23:15	00:23:17	Huh?
332	00:23:20	00:23:21	Don't want to do it now?
333	00:23:21	00:23:23	Okay, I'll tell you what, we'll do it another time.
334	00:23:23	00:23:25	Take care, buddy.
335	00:23:28	00:23:31	I'm going to put some police officers at the door.
336	00:23:31	00:23:35	I don't think the KD will try anything here, but you never know.
337	00:23:35	00:23:36	Are you finished?
338	00:23:36	00:23:38	I still got to collect biologicals.
339	00:23:38	00:23:40	I'll see you later.
340	00:23:48	00:23:49	He understands English, right?
341	00:23:49	00:23:51	Mm-hmm.
342	00:23:51	00:23:53	Hi, Park. My name is Gil.
343	00:23:53	00:23:57	I'm not a doctor, I'm not a policeman.
344	00:23:57	00:23:59	I'm kind of a...
345	00:23:59	00:24:02	What am I? I don't know.
346	00:24:02	00:24:04	I mostly do a lot of thinking.
347	00:24:04	00:24:08	But I do need to look under your fingernails.
348	00:24:13	00:24:15	I'm not going to grab your hand.
349	00:24:16	00:24:19	I'll just wait here until you want to give it to me, okay?
350	00:24:19	00:24:22	But I promise you it won't hurt.
351	00:24:33	00:24:34	Thank you.
352	00:24:47	00:24:48	Hello, Mrs. Chin.
353	00:24:48	00:24:50	I got here as fast as I could.
354	00:24:50	00:24:52	Dr. Eisling, this is Mr. Grissom from the crime lab.
355	00:24:52	00:24:54	How do you do?
356	00:24:54	00:24:55	Hey, Park.
357	00:24:56	00:24:59	We're, uh... we're going to have to give him his medication here.
358	00:25:01	00:25:02	He doesn't seem to want it.
359	00:25:02	00:25:05	Well, that's why we gave him a gastric tube.
360	00:25:05	00:25:06	Okay, now come on...
361	00:25:06	00:25:08	No! (yelling in Korean) Okay, come on...
362	00:25:08	00:25:10	Can you hold him, please?
363	00:25:10	00:25:14	I know, I know... Okay, I know, I know. (yelling in Korean)
364	00:25:14	00:25:16	Come hold him. Come hold him.
365	00:25:16	00:25:18	Just take his arm.
366	00:25:18	00:25:21	I know. I know.
367	00:25:23	00:25:24	Stay still, Stay still.
368	00:25:27	00:25:29	Okay. All right.
369	00:25:31	00:25:35	So Park was wearing the white T-shirt during the shooting.
370	00:25:35	00:25:37	He changed into the blue one at the old woman's house.
371	00:25:37	00:25:39	Threw the white one away.
372	00:25:39	00:25:42	Makes sense. Had his mother and his uncle's blood all over him.
373	00:25:47	00:25:49	Park Bang's tox report.
374	00:25:49	00:25:52	Most adult cancer patients don't have this many drugs in their systems.
375	00:25:52	00:25:54	But an eight-year-old...?
376	00:25:54	00:25:55	Never seen anything like it.
377	00:25:55	00:26:02	Most of the drugs on that list are meant to stop cell development, stop bone marrow from producing blood, stop proteins from assembling.
378	00:26:02	00:26:09	If he continues on this regimen, by the time he's 15, he won't even have the physical development of a ten-year-old.
379	00:26:09	00:26:10	Does he actually have AIDS?
380	00:26:11	00:26:12	No, not yet.
381	00:26:12	00:26:13	He's HIV-positive.
382	00:26:13	00:26:16	If you ask me, he's being badly overmedicated.
383	00:26:16	00:26:18	Zendrek has an FDA black box label.
384	00:26:18	00:26:20	That's the strongest warning there is.
385	00:26:20	00:26:22	Life-threatening side effects.
386	00:26:22	00:26:23	Some of the other drugs aren't even on the market.
387	00:26:23	00:26:26	They're only being used in clinical trials.
388	00:26:26	00:26:27	Maybe he's in one.
389	00:26:27	00:26:32	How does a little kid with a junkie mother and gangster father get on a clinical trial?
390	00:27:19	00:27:21	Well, so much for the upstanding businessman.
391	00:27:21	00:27:28	This guy's real name is Jin Ming and his mug shot was taken when he was 18 years old when he was caught stealing cars with a street racing gang.
392	00:27:28	00:27:31	Now he's 30 and he hasn't been busted since.
393	00:27:31	00:27:34	And Park had this guy's skin under his fingernails? Yeah.
394	00:27:34	00:27:35	So they must been fighting?
395	00:27:35	00:27:36	Possibly.
396	00:27:36	00:27:42	The thing is, that skin that was under Park's nails-- it was gluteus maximus.
397	00:27:42	00:27:48	It's very similar to the epidermal tissue on the rest of the body, but it's got far fewer hair follicles.
398	00:27:48	00:27:52	So, in addition to everything else, this kid's been molested?
399	00:27:52	00:27:54	Well, maybe not.
400	00:27:54	00:27:57	Here.
401	00:27:57	00:27:59	Take a look at Jin's neck.
402	00:27:59	00:28:01	No tattoos.
403	00:28:01	00:28:03	He had a major makeover.
404	00:28:03	00:28:04	Yeah.
405	00:28:04	00:28:09	I went out a couple times with a casino executive who had some really unusual scars.
406	00:28:09	00:28:14	And, long story short, he told me that he was very embarrassed by some old tattoos that he had.
407	00:28:14	00:28:17	So he had them covered with replicated skin.
408	00:28:17	00:28:18	From his butt?
409	00:28:18	00:28:20	I didn't ask.
410	00:28:20	00:28:26	But, you know, if you're a street racer, then it might be kind of cool to flash a lot of ink.
411	00:28:27	00:28:29	But if you're a Kkangpae Dragon...
412	00:28:29	00:28:31	It pays to be invisible.
413	00:28:35	00:28:37	I got left.
414	00:28:59	00:29:02	This basement's the only room with anything in it.
415	00:29:02	00:29:05	The uni's were looking for the kid, first time through.
416	00:29:05	00:29:07	It's probably why they missed it.
417	00:29:07	00:29:10	This must be where Park and his mother lived.
418	00:29:11	00:29:16	Why would this guy Jin kill somebody he let live in his house?
419	00:29:16	00:29:18	He's in a gang. She's a druggie.
420	00:29:18	00:29:21	The possibilities are endless.
421	00:29:21	00:29:23	Yeah.
422	00:29:44	00:29:46	Look at this.
423	00:29:48	00:29:50	Scumbag's in the picture with them.
424	00:29:51	00:29:53	(beeping) Down!
425	00:29:58	00:29:59	Officer down!
426	00:30:00	00:30:02	Clear the house and call the paramedics!
427	00:30:05	00:30:07	Detective Cavaliere's going to be all right.
428	00:30:07	00:30:09	Minor injuries.
429	00:30:09	00:30:11	Bomb squad said the explosive was a trip wire booby trap.
430	00:30:11	00:30:16	Yeah, if Jin and the K D. really wanted to hurt somebody, they would've sent a more powerful message.
431	00:30:16	00:30:20	So, I found an ambulance chaser's card on Kora Sil's desk.
432	00:30:20	00:30:22	I just got off the phone with him.
433	00:30:22	00:30:25	He claims that Kora was suing Park's doctor.
434	00:30:25	00:30:26	For what? Money.
435	00:30:26	00:30:30	According to the lawyer, the doctor paid Kora to put Park on the clinical trial.
436	00:30:31	00:30:32	She wanted more.
437	00:30:32	00:30:33	How much was she getting?
438	00:30:33	00:30:35	25 a week.
439	00:30:35	00:30:37	She wanted 50.
440	00:31:28	00:31:30	Hello, Doctor. What are you doing here?
441	00:31:31	00:31:32	I'm here to give Park his medication.
442	00:31:32	00:31:35	Oh, yeah. He needs to get it every day, doesn't he?
443	00:31:35	00:31:36	Yes.
444	00:31:36	00:31:37	Or else the data's useless.
445	00:31:37	00:31:39	I suppose so.
446	00:31:39	00:31:43	Well, then what good would it do to continue to dose him after he went missing for two days?
447	00:31:43	00:31:46	These drugs are saving his life.
448	00:31:46	00:31:47	No, they're not.
449	00:31:47	00:31:50	I don't need to be a medical doctor to see that.
450	00:31:50	00:31:52	No, what you're seeing are side effects.
451	00:31:52	00:31:54	And there are side effects to every drug.
452	00:31:54	00:31:58	Look, this is a legitimate clinical trial, Mr. Grissom, approved by a formal committee...
453	00:31:59	00:32:04	Consisting of doctors who are shareholders in the pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.
454	00:32:04	00:32:06	Without these trials, these kids get nothing.
455	00:32:06	00:32:08	And what do you get?
456	00:32:08	00:32:09	Kickbacks?
457	00:32:09	00:32:11	Your medical opinion is irrelevant.
458	00:32:11	00:32:14	What I'm doing is perfectly legal.
459	00:32:14	00:32:15	So, we're done here. Excuse me.
460	00:32:16	00:32:20	You touch that kid, and I will charge you with reckless endangerment.
461	00:32:21	00:32:24	Child Services will back him up on that.
462	00:32:24	00:32:26	So I think you're done here.
463	00:32:28	00:32:31	We'll see about that.
464	00:32:44	00:32:46	Park...
465	00:32:46	00:32:50	I need to ask you a few questions.
466	00:32:50	00:32:54	You don't have to answer them, if you don't want to, okay?
467	00:33:01	00:33:04	Do you know this man?
468	00:33:06	00:33:10	That's Jin.
469	00:33:10	00:33:13	Did you and your mother live at his house?
470	00:33:18	00:33:20	Is that where Uncle Sung found you?
471	00:33:22	00:33:23	Yeah.
472	00:33:45	00:33:48	Uncle Sung didn't like my tube.
473	00:33:49	00:33:52	He fought with Mama.
474	00:33:57	00:33:59	Then Jin came down.
475	00:34:06	00:34:10	Uncle Sung saved me.
476	00:34:10	00:34:12	What happened after that?
477	00:34:16	00:34:21	I'm not gonna let Jin or Dr. Eisling hurt you.
478	00:34:21	00:34:27	But that's why I need to know what happened.
479	00:34:27	00:34:29	Jin and Mama found us.
480	00:35:04	00:35:06	Why would he want to hurt your mother?
481	00:35:06	00:35:10	I guess he was just sick of having us around.
482	00:35:16	00:35:18	I finally got a statement from the kid.
483	00:35:18	00:35:22	He says that Jin shot both his mother and his Uncle with two different guns.
484	00:35:23	00:35:24	Well, that's great.
485	00:35:24	00:35:26	Uh, that should be enough to charge Jin when we find him.
486	00:35:26	00:35:29	I-I just got faxed Sun Bang's prison record.
487	00:35:30	00:35:33	And there's something weird on his personal release form.
488	00:35:33	00:35:36	the guy left prison with a nine millimeter.
489	00:35:36	00:35:38	They let him out of jail with a gun?
490	00:35:38	00:35:39	Well, it's only a misdemeanor, you know.
491	00:35:39	00:35:41	It's like a hotel; you get back what you checked in.
492	00:35:41	00:35:43	So you can go out and commit a felony.
493	00:35:43	00:35:44	Apparently.
494	00:35:44	00:35:47	Now, is there any chance that Sung fired back?
495	00:35:47	00:35:49	No, we would have found extra bullets or shells at the scene.
496	00:35:49	00:35:52	Well, maybe there's a bullet lodged in Jin's body.
497	00:35:52	00:35:54	No sign of a third bleeder.
498	00:35:54	00:35:57	And if I understand the kid, Sung never got a chance to shoot back.
499	00:35:57	00:35:59	Okay, thanks. I'll work on this.
500	00:36:12	00:36:13	Yep.
501	00:36:13	00:36:15	He carried his gun in his waistband.
502	00:36:15	00:36:18	Still doesn't mean he used it.
503	00:36:18	00:36:20	And doesn't really change Park's story.
504	00:36:22	00:36:24	How do we know Kora wasn't packing?
505	00:36:26	00:36:28	The father of her son was a gangster.
506	00:36:28	00:36:29	She was living with a gangster.
507	00:36:29	00:36:30	I wouldn't put it past her.
508	00:36:31	00:36:33	Well, let's see.
509	00:36:35	00:36:40	Most women's clothes don't have a place to hide a gun.
510	00:36:40	00:36:41	That's, uh...
511	00:36:43	00:36:44	That's what purses are for.
512	00:36:51	00:36:54	Maybe Kora didn't need Jin to get her son back.
513	00:36:54	00:36:56	Maybe she took care of it herself.
514	00:37:33	00:37:35	You think they shot each other.
515	00:37:35	00:37:36	Why not?
516	00:37:36	00:37:39	There's motive, the evidence suggests it.
517	00:37:39	00:37:42	Where are their guns?
518	00:37:42	00:37:44	Dead man with a gun in the hood.
519	00:37:44	00:37:45	Gone in 60 seconds.
520	00:37:46	00:37:51	Jin skips town because this family dispute uncovers his once invisible gang.
521	00:37:51	00:37:54	He leaves the booby trap because he's angry about it.
522	00:37:54	00:37:56	It's possible.
523	00:37:56	00:37:59	It's also possible that Jin shot both vics.
524	00:37:59	00:38:00	Which is what the kid said.
525	00:38:00	00:38:02	And he was the closest witness.
526	00:38:02	00:38:07	If your uncle and your mother shot each other, you would probably blame the gangbanger, too.
527	00:38:10	00:38:12	Okay, pilgrim...
528	00:38:12	00:38:14	we'll settle this on the street.
529	00:38:17	00:38:19	If you need any water or anything, you just let me know.
530	00:38:19	00:38:21	Okay.
531	00:38:21	00:38:29	Okay, Park, I know you already told me what-what happened, but now I need you to show me what happened, okay?
532	00:38:29	00:38:35	Now, we're gonna pretend that this is your mother, this is your uncle, and that's Jin.
533	00:38:35	00:38:40	Would you show me where your uncle was standing when the shooting began?
534	00:38:48	00:38:51	Where was your mother standing when the shooting began?
535	00:39:01	00:39:03	Would you show me where Jin was standing?
536	00:39:09	00:39:11	And where were you standing?
537	00:39:17	00:39:19	Did your uncle have a gun?
538	00:39:20	00:39:23	Did your mother have a gun?
539	00:39:25	00:39:29	Did your mother fall down before Jin shot her?
540	00:39:31	00:39:34	Did Jin fall down before he shot your mother?
541	00:39:37	00:39:38	He's lying.
542	00:39:38	00:39:43	Well, the ferrotrace doesn't confirm that either of them had guns at the time of the shooting.
543	00:39:43	00:39:45	But the trajectory...
544	00:39:45	00:39:46	Neither Kora nor Jin fell.
545	00:39:46	00:39:50	How do you explain Kora's 20-degree entry?
546	00:39:54	00:40:00	Park, could you show me how Jin shot your mother?
547	00:40:14	00:40:16	Bang, bang!
548	00:40:21	00:40:22	Park, would you do that again?
549	00:40:22	00:40:24	But this time, keep your arm out.
550	00:40:24	00:40:26	Bang, bang!
551	00:41:32	00:41:35	The kid shot his mother for shooting his uncle.
552	00:41:35	00:41:38	So you think Jin had nothing to do with it?
553	00:41:38	00:41:40	Not the shooting.
554	00:41:40	00:41:41	Well, it makes sense.
555	00:41:41	00:41:44	I mean, his uncle was trying to protect him, and his mother was torturing him.
556	00:41:46	00:41:51	Park never controlled anything in his life till he fired that gun.
557	00:42:04	00:42:07	An HIV-positive eight-year-old.
558	00:42:07	00:42:10	No wonder no one wanted to talk.
559	00:42:10	00:42:13	Juvi may be the best thing for him.
560	00:42:14	00:42:16	He'll get the care he needs there.
561	00:42:16	00:42:18	Yeah.
562	00:42:20	00:42:22	I'm sorry we solved this.
563	00:42:27	00:42:28	I really am.
