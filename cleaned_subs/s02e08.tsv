0	00:00:07	00:00:08	You're going down!
1	00:00:11	00:00:14	I got you, I got you!
2	00:00:14	00:00:16	I got you!
3	00:00:16	00:00:18	I got you.
4	00:00:27	00:00:29	Butchy, what's wrong?
5	00:00:29	00:00:31	Keep going.
6	00:00:49	00:00:52	You've been walking in circles for ten minutes.
7	00:00:52	00:00:54	There's no sign of struggle.
8	00:00:54	00:00:56	Whatever happened happened somewhere else.
9	00:00:56	00:00:58	This is a secondary scene.
10	00:00:58	00:01:00	Body dump?
11	00:01:00	00:01:01	Textbook.
12	00:01:01	00:01:04	David, when we dig her up I want you to tag her special processing.
13	00:01:05	00:01:07	Yes, sir.
14	00:01:07	00:01:11	Only person who knows where the crime scene is has a mouthful of sand.
15	00:01:11	00:01:17	A thousand square miles of desert in Vegas and this perp dumps the body in a sandbox.
16	00:01:17	00:01:19	He didn't put it here to hide it.
17	00:01:19	00:01:21	He put it here to be found.
18	00:01:56	00:01:58	What do you think?
19	00:01:58	00:02:02	I think we got a van full of tools we can't use.
20	00:02:02	00:02:04	Sand's a nightmare.
21	00:02:04	00:02:07	To get to the evidence, we may destroy the evidence.
22	00:02:07	00:02:11	You get these haikus out of a book or do they just come to you?
23	00:02:12	00:02:20	Every time you find a body you have to choose a path and when you take that path, Grasshopper you risk destroying the evidence.
24	00:02:20	00:02:26	We grab a trowel and some fine mesh screens and we just pretend like we're panning for gold...
25	00:02:26	00:02:27	Master.
26	00:03:34	00:03:36	Gunshot victim shipped to Desert Palms.
27	00:03:36	00:03:38	Santee Cherna, 32.
28	00:03:38	00:03:40	Runs this check-cashing joint.
29	00:03:40	00:03:42	Cash business, huh? You bet.
30	00:03:42	00:03:44	Was shot in the leg making his weekly bank run.
31	00:03:44	00:03:47	Let me guess-- the guy makes his run same time every week.
32	00:03:47	00:03:49	Night deposit.
33	00:03:49	00:03:51	He's either stupid or suicidal.
34	00:03:51	00:03:54	We can't arrest people for that, unfortunately.
35	00:03:54	00:03:56	Whole thing went down here?
36	00:03:56	00:03:59	Sister heard a gunshot, saw a car take off.
37	00:03:59	00:04:01	Okay, I'm going to do a once-around.
38	00:04:02	00:04:04	All right, I'll take the lot.
39	00:07:07	00:07:10	You run this car already?
40	00:07:10	00:07:11	Oh, yeah.
41	00:07:11	00:07:12	The RO's our vic.
42	00:07:12	00:07:13	That's his spot.
43	00:07:13	00:07:14	Right here? Mm-hmm.
44	00:07:15	00:07:16	Hey, Warrick!
45	00:07:16	00:07:18	Check this out!
46	00:07:25	00:07:27	We're dealing with some criminal geniuses.
47	00:07:27	00:07:30	Grab the money bag, slice it and run.
48	00:07:30	00:07:33	You forgot the leave the evidence on the ground.
49	00:07:34	00:07:36	Let's see.
50	00:07:38	00:07:43	We got some checks no cash...
51	00:07:43	00:07:47	and a deposit slip for $22,500.
52	00:07:47	00:07:52	So, our victim breaks out of the store with a bag full of dough...
53	00:07:52	00:07:54	Same time every week.
54	00:07:54	00:07:56	Guess somebody was casing the joint, huh?
55	00:07:56	00:08:00	Or... it was an inside job.
56	00:08:01	00:08:02	This morning everything was fine.
57	00:08:03	00:08:08	Then some pendejo attacks my brother and we're out God knows how much money and now I'm stuck running this place alone.
58	00:08:08	00:08:10	Um, Ms. Delgado, I know you're upset...
59	00:08:10	00:08:11	Upset?
60	00:08:11	00:08:13	Upset is for white people, lady.
61	00:08:13	00:08:14	I'm pissed off.
62	00:08:15	00:08:16	My brother was just shot in the thigh, okay?
63	00:08:16	00:08:19	That's awful close to serious if you know what I'm saying.
64	00:08:19	00:08:22	Ms. Delgado, how long have you been here?
65	00:08:22	00:08:23	Six years.
66	00:08:23	00:08:24	You have insurance?
67	00:08:25	00:08:26	You better have insurance.
68	00:08:26	00:08:29	You take 15% of a man's paycheck just to cash it.
69	00:08:29	00:08:32	People use us but they don't like us.
70	00:08:32	00:08:33	Thank you.
71	00:08:40	00:08:41	So...
72	00:08:41	00:08:43	You think the brother might be behind this?
73	00:08:43	00:08:46	Well, I might bet my own paycheck on that one.
74	00:08:46	00:08:52	But if that's true then our vic gets to collect the insurance money plus he gets to keep the money he stole for himself.
75	00:08:52	00:08:54	Nice scam.
76	00:08:54	00:08:55	Check it out.
77	00:08:55	00:08:59	What's the first thing you do when you see one of these on your windshield?
78	00:08:59	00:09:00	Chuck it. Exactly.
79	00:09:00	00:09:03	But the only guy to chuck his was the victim.
80	00:09:03	00:09:06	I found one on the ground next to his car.
81	00:09:06	00:09:11	That means whoever put these here wasn't gone long when the brother was shot.
82	00:09:11	00:09:12	Potential eyewitness.
83	00:09:12	00:09:15	She died two to four hours before she was discovered.
84	00:09:15	00:09:23	Jury's still out on cause of death but considering the whip and ligature marks it's no stretch to say it was violent.
85	00:09:23	00:09:25	Some of the scars on her back are years old.
86	00:09:25	00:09:26	Some are fresh.
87	00:09:26	00:09:28	So what are we looking at?
88	00:09:28	00:09:29	Rape, multiple sexual assaults?
89	00:09:29	00:09:31	That's the strange part.
90	00:09:31	00:09:36	Her body's a road map of abuse but there's no sign it was sexual.
91	00:09:36	00:09:38	She hasn't had intercourse in months.
92	00:09:38	00:09:39	I'm thinking trade-in.
93	00:09:39	00:09:47	Some lowlife gets tired of beating on the old model so he punches her ticket and starts shopping around for a version 2.0.
94	00:09:47	00:09:53	Here's a woman who's been beaten on a regular basis but look at the care she's lavished on herself.
95	00:09:53	00:09:57	Manicured fingernails, manicured toenails.
96	00:09:57	00:10:00	Perfect teeth, hair.
97	00:10:03	00:10:07	Not to mention some serious breast augmentation.
98	00:10:07	00:10:10	That is not a Tijuana boob job.
99	00:10:10	00:10:12	Those puppies are top-of-the-line.
100	00:10:12	00:10:14	At least we've got a pair of saline leads.
101	00:10:14	00:10:15	Can you grab me one of those?
102	00:10:15	00:10:17	Left or right?
103	00:10:17	00:10:18	Dealer's choice.
104	00:10:25	00:10:26	What up, Einstein?
105	00:10:26	00:10:28	Ooh, you got anything there?
106	00:10:29	00:10:32	You think Einstein had people hovering over his shoulders all the time?
107	00:10:32	00:10:37	If he did, do you think that we'd be walking around with E=MC squared t-shirts?
108	00:10:42	00:10:43	Would you step back?
109	00:10:43	00:10:44	Just give me some breathing room?
110	00:10:44	00:10:49	Maybe I'll tell you something about the silver sliver that Grissom found on Sandbox Girl's back.
111	00:10:49	00:10:51	It's all yours.
112	00:11:03	00:11:06	Let's see what the library has to say.
113	00:11:09	00:11:10	Tempered steel with aluminum coating.
114	00:11:10	00:11:12	Maybe she was chained up.
115	00:11:12	00:11:14	If she was, she was wearing something pretty funky.
116	00:11:15	00:11:16	She was in the raw.
117	00:11:16	00:11:17	Yeah, in a manner of speaking.
118	00:11:17	00:11:19	Remember that sparkly stuff that Grissom got off her body?
119	00:11:19	00:11:20	Yeah.
120	00:11:20	00:11:23	I broke it down-- tree sap, ammonia and water.
121	00:11:23	00:11:25	Sounds like frat house gravy.
122	00:11:25	00:11:27	Liquid latex.
123	00:11:27	00:11:28	Never heard of it.
124	00:11:28	00:11:30	Really? It's all the craze right now, man.
125	00:11:30	00:11:31	Girls paint it on guys.
126	00:11:31	00:11:33	Guys paint it on girls.
127	00:11:33	00:11:36	You can paint it on yourself if you want if that's what you're into.
128	00:11:36	00:11:37	You can't get a date.
129	00:11:37	00:11:37	I got it.
130	00:11:38	00:11:39	Like I would know.
131	00:11:39	00:11:41	Sure, sure. I got it, man.
132	00:11:50	00:11:52	Hey, is that our guy?
133	00:11:55	00:11:56	Detective Vega, LVPD.
134	00:11:56	00:11:58	Can I see some ID?
135	00:11:58	00:12:00	I am a legitimate businessman.
136	00:12:00	00:12:02	My card.
137	00:12:02	00:12:04	How often do you distribute around here?
138	00:12:04	00:12:05	On this street?
139	00:12:05	00:12:06	Every Thursday and Friday.
140	00:12:06	00:12:07	Is that a crime?
141	00:12:07	00:12:09	Well, that depends.
142	00:12:09	00:12:11	Did you see anything unusual last night?
143	00:12:11	00:12:13	In the parking lot at Flamingo and Rhodes?
144	00:12:13	00:12:18	I don't know what city you live in, missy but in Las Vegas, unusual is what happens when you leave the house.
145	00:12:18	00:12:20	We can do this at the station if that works better for you.
146	00:12:20	00:12:21	Okay, okay.
147	00:12:21	00:12:25	Um, some jerk told me if I touched his car he'd shove a flyer down my throat.
148	00:12:25	00:12:26	Does that count?
149	00:12:26	00:12:29	Maybe. Did you get a good look at him?
150	00:12:29	00:12:30	Them. There were two.
151	00:12:30	00:12:33	A couple of lowlifes in baseball caps.
152	00:12:33	00:12:34	What about the car?
153	00:12:34	00:12:35	Did you notice the make?
154	00:12:35	00:12:37	Honda, maybe.
155	00:12:37	00:12:41	All those tin boxes look alike.
156	00:12:41	00:12:44	Dr. Cornfeld?
157	00:12:44	00:12:47	Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
158	00:12:48	00:12:52	I believe this is one of yours.
159	00:12:52	00:12:54	Oh, yeah. 414 series.
160	00:12:54	00:12:55	Firm, but plenty of give.
161	00:12:55	00:12:57	Spare me the sales pitch.
162	00:12:57	00:13:00	We removed that from a homicide victim.
163	00:13:00	00:13:02	I've got a photo.
164	00:13:02	00:13:05	Judging by the size she had a pretty decent pair to start with.
165	00:13:07	00:13:09	Oh, she was a pretty girl.
166	00:13:09	00:13:11	I'm going to need her name.
167	00:13:13	00:13:14	Let's see.
168	00:13:14	00:13:16	Oh, yeah, here we go.
169	00:13:16	00:13:19	Third-party billing, but I do recognize the address.
170	00:13:19	00:13:20	They send me a lot of business.
171	00:13:21	00:13:22	Mona Taylor.
172	00:13:22	00:13:23	She must have worked there.
173	00:13:23	00:13:25	Real shame.
174	00:13:27	00:13:33	I'll tell you what's a shame-- that she was so pretty and perfect and still thought she needed implants.
175	00:13:33	00:13:36	You shouldn't judge Mona for wanting to improve herself.
176	00:13:36	00:13:40	Competition's intense especially for a young woman living in Las Vegas.
177	00:13:40	00:13:41	Why don't you put yourself in her shoes?
178	00:13:41	00:13:43	Trust me-- I've been in her shoes.
179	00:13:43	00:13:44	I got out of them.
180	00:13:44	00:13:45	Oh, yeah, why is that?
181	00:13:45	00:13:48	They were killing me.
182	00:13:52	00:13:55	Are you sure the surgeon said this is where Mona Taylor worked?
183	00:13:55	00:13:57	Maybe she was a domestic.
184	00:13:57	00:13:59	No domestic has a $10,000 rack.
185	00:13:59	00:14:01	Not even in Vegas.
186	00:14:01	00:14:06	Well, the DMV records indicate that she hit town from South Dakota three years ago.
187	00:14:06	00:14:10	I figure the bright lights faded and she snagged a sugar daddy.
188	00:14:10	00:14:13	How much business can one sugar daddy give a plastic surgeon?
189	00:14:14	00:14:17	The eternal question to which we're about to find the answer.
190	00:14:22	00:14:28	Let me guess-- three police officers looking for respite from having to control and dominate our big, bad city?
191	00:14:28	00:14:32	Close-- one police officer, two criminalists.
192	00:14:32	00:14:34	May we come in?
193	00:14:42	00:14:45	Another happy customer.
194	00:14:47	00:14:51	Now, would you prefer individual sessions or would you like to enjoy each other's submission?
195	00:14:55	00:14:57	You don't have to decide now.
196	00:14:57	00:15:01	Please, make yourselves comfortable and welcome to Lady Heather's Dominion.
197	00:15:09	00:15:11	That's her.
198	00:15:11	00:15:14	I'm for fun. Right.
199	00:15:15	00:15:17	She drove herself to work.
200	00:15:17	00:15:20	But she didn't drive herself home.
201	00:15:25	00:15:26	Still locked.
202	00:15:32	00:15:35	Looks clean.
203	00:15:39	00:15:41	Hey, Catherine....
204	00:15:41	00:15:43	Come check this out.
205	00:15:49	00:15:50	What's that?
206	00:15:50	00:15:52	Liquid latex.
207	00:15:52	00:15:54	Grissom found some on the victim.
208	00:15:54	00:15:56	Sanders did a trace analysis.
209	00:15:56	00:15:57	Stuff peels off like a glove.
210	00:15:58	00:15:59	Handy.
211	00:15:59	00:16:00	Yeah.
212	00:16:00	00:16:02	What do you think that is there?
213	00:16:03	00:16:04	Watch?
214	00:16:04	00:16:05	Bag it.
215	00:16:05	00:16:09	We can get a mold and try and track it down.
216	00:16:09	00:16:12	Never lost one of my girls.
217	00:16:12	00:16:15	You don't seem very upset about it.
218	00:16:15	00:16:19	What you see and what I feel are two different things.
219	00:16:19	00:16:20	Really?
220	00:16:20	00:16:22	Were there any disturbances last night?
221	00:16:22	00:16:23	Did you hear screams?
222	00:16:27	00:16:30	It's when I don't hear screams that I start to worry.
223	00:16:31	00:16:34	Well, then can you tell us what time Mona got off?
224	00:16:34	00:16:36	Knowing Mona, every couple of hours.
225	00:16:36	00:16:37	She enjoyed her work.
226	00:16:37	00:16:42	There's no sexual contact or anything illegal going on here, of course.
227	00:16:42	00:16:46	Captain Brass, surely you don't think sexual contact is the only means of fulfillment?
228	00:16:46	00:16:50	Lady Heather you don't what to know what I think.
229	00:16:50	00:16:52	00.
230	00:16:52	00:16:54	She would have left at midnight.
231	00:16:54	00:16:57	Do you have any kind of log book?
232	00:16:57	00:16:58	Some record of who was working that night?
233	00:16:59	00:17:01	What they did with their clients, that sort of thing?
234	00:17:01	00:17:03	Would that get you excited?
235	00:17:03	00:17:04	Not particularly.
236	00:17:04	00:17:07	But it might help us catch the creep who murdered Mona.
237	00:17:07	00:17:09	We need names and addresses.
238	00:17:09	00:17:13	We also need to know which rooms she worked last night so we can examine them.
239	00:17:13	00:17:15	Mona worked the pool house.
240	00:17:15	00:17:16	Give me a minute.
241	00:17:17	00:17:19	I'll have to move some clients around.
242	00:17:19	00:17:23	Oh, there you are.
243	00:17:23	00:17:25	Um, Mona's car is in the driveway.
244	00:17:25	00:17:26	It looks clean.
245	00:17:26	00:17:30	Okay, tow it to CSI and then start processing the rooms in the pool house where Mona worked last night.
246	00:17:30	00:17:33	And you will be...?
247	00:17:33	00:17:34	I'll be in with Lady Heather.
248	00:17:46	00:17:49	Does all this fascinate you?
249	00:17:49	00:17:51	Yes.
250	00:17:52	00:17:59	I find all deviant behavior fascinating in that to understand our human nature we have to understand our aberrations.
251	00:18:00	00:18:03	And you think what goes on here is aberrant?
252	00:18:03	00:18:08	I would say that whip marks and ligature contusions on a young woman are aberrant.
253	00:18:08	00:18:09	Wouldn't you?
254	00:18:09	00:18:12	Every job has its peculiar hazards.
255	00:18:13	00:18:14	Rock stars damage their ear drums.
256	00:18:14	00:18:16	Football players ruin their knees.
257	00:18:16	00:18:18	In this business, it's scars.
258	00:18:18	00:18:21	But no one who works for me has ever sustained a serious injury.
259	00:18:21	00:18:23	Mona did.
260	00:18:23	00:18:24	She died.
261	00:18:24	00:18:26	Not because she worked here.
262	00:18:26	00:18:28	That's your assumption.
263	00:18:30	00:18:33	What happens here isn't about violence.
264	00:18:33	00:18:38	It's about challenging preconceived notions of Victorian normalcy.
265	00:18:38	00:18:40	Bringing people's fantasies to life.
266	00:18:40	00:18:41	Making them real and acceptable.
267	00:18:41	00:18:43	Like the theater.
268	00:18:48	00:18:52	It's people who don't come to places like this that I worry about.
269	00:18:52	00:18:54	The ones who don't have an outlet.
270	00:18:55	00:18:58	Say... someone like yourself.
271	00:18:58	00:19:00	Oh, I have outlets.
272	00:19:00	00:19:02	I read.
273	00:19:03	00:19:06	I study bugs.
274	00:19:06	00:19:09	I sometimes even ride roller coasters.
275	00:19:09	00:19:11	And your sex life?
276	00:19:11	00:19:14	It doesn't involve going to the theater.
277	00:19:17	00:19:22	In my experience, Mr. Grissom, some men go to the theater...
278	00:19:22	00:19:24	some men are the theater.
279	00:19:24	00:19:30	Either way, what I offer is a chance for submission or control, whichever's required.
280	00:19:30	00:19:34	Sometimes a client doesn't know what he wants until I show him.
281	00:19:34	00:19:41	No man is a complete mystery except to himself.
282	00:19:41	00:19:42	Marcel Proust.
283	00:19:42	00:19:46	I bet he'd have enjoyed himself here.
284	00:19:46	00:19:47	Probably.
285	00:19:47	00:19:50	No crime is a complete mystery, either.
286	00:19:50	00:19:53	The whip marks on Mona Taylor were fresh.
287	00:19:53	00:19:55	That can't be.
288	00:19:55	00:19:57	Mona was dominant with her clients.
289	00:20:01	00:20:05	I know that sometimes she saw clients off the books.
290	00:20:05	00:20:10	I let her because she brought in so much business but I just assumed she knew what she was doing.
291	00:20:11	00:20:15	My guess is that one of her off-the-book clients...
292	00:20:15	00:20:18	is a regular.
293	00:20:19	00:20:24	I mean, it is a repeat business, is it not?
294	00:20:28	00:20:30	Does that one interest you?
295	00:20:31	00:20:33	Yes, it does.
296	00:20:33	00:20:35	May I borrow it?
297	00:20:45	00:20:48	All right, Randolph you may lick my boots and go.
298	00:20:48	00:20:50	Is it because I'm naughty?
299	00:20:50	00:20:51	Shut up!
300	00:20:55	00:20:58	I feel like I'm trapped in the Marquis de Sade's brain pan.
301	00:20:59	00:21:02	Yeah, I guess Lady Heather hasn't quite cleared this room yet.
302	00:21:02	00:21:05	Waiting for recess.
303	00:21:30	00:21:34	Didn't Grissom say he found some flecks of silver on the victim's back?
304	00:21:34	00:21:35	Yeah.
305	00:21:37	00:21:40	I may have found the source.
306	00:21:40	00:21:41	Mm-hmm.
307	00:21:57	00:21:58	Hey, hey.
308	00:21:59	00:22:00	Liquid latex.
309	00:22:00	00:22:03	Like the kind we found in the Dumpster and on the vic.
310	00:22:03	00:22:05	Hand me a bindle, will you?
311	00:22:05	00:22:07	You know what I just realized?
312	00:22:07	00:22:08	Hmm?
313	00:22:08	00:22:11	None of this weirds me out anymore.
314	00:22:11	00:22:15	People are just as twisted in their own living rooms.
315	00:22:15	00:22:18	Props are different here, that's all.
316	00:22:18	00:22:20	Well, not everybody's twisted.
317	00:22:20	00:22:21	Everybody, Nick.
318	00:22:21	00:22:23	Wake up and smell the species.
319	00:22:24	00:22:31	Catherine, do you really think that those freaks out there running around with their little dog collars on getting spanked are the same as you and me?
320	00:22:31	00:22:34	Just because you never did it doesn't mean you never could.
321	00:22:34	00:22:36	No way; never going to happen.
322	00:22:36	00:22:38	Well, relax, Nick.
323	00:22:38	00:22:40	All I'm saying is you're human.
324	00:22:41	00:22:44	Hey, man, my mom and dad are human, and...
325	00:22:44	00:22:49	There's one thing you learn on this job is that human beings are capable of anything.
326	00:22:49	00:22:53	A smudge of dirty tire on a ratty piece of paper?
327	00:22:53	00:22:55	I know, I know, it sucks.
328	00:22:55	00:22:58	You couldn't get anything off of it, huh?
329	00:22:58	00:23:00	Just because I'm a newbie, doesn't mean I'm not good.
330	00:23:00	00:23:02	Your tire print from the strip mall.
331	00:23:02	00:23:04	Wow.
332	00:23:04	00:23:06	Common to a lot of compacts and subcompacts.
333	00:23:06	00:23:08	Honda.
334	00:23:08	00:23:11	So, that confirms what Sara's eyewitness said.
335	00:23:11	00:23:12	What else you got?
336	00:23:12	00:23:16	I've got incidental marks from where the tire ran over something.
337	00:23:16	00:23:18	Left an impression.
338	00:23:21	00:23:25	All you have to do is find the tire attached to the vehicle your shooter was driving.
339	00:23:25	00:23:26	Thanks.
340	00:23:27	00:23:30	Ok now, look at the bullet from your vic's thigh.
341	00:23:30	00:23:33	Five lands and grooves on it.
342	00:23:33	00:23:35	That would be a Colt.
343	00:23:35	00:23:36	.38 caliber.
344	00:23:36	00:23:39	According to Vega the vic owns a Colt.
345	00:23:39	00:23:40	And?
346	00:23:40	00:23:47	And... since he mysteriously got shot in the leg instead of a vital organ I'm thinking I should go visit him.
347	00:23:47	00:23:53	Mona Taylor didn't die from the beatings asphyxia.
348	00:23:53	00:23:55	You look like you expected it.
349	00:23:55	00:23:56	I considered it.
350	00:23:56	00:23:58	Well, there's something else.
351	00:23:58	00:24:02	She had some odd scaring in the inside of her nose.
352	00:24:02	00:24:05	Some small red circle.
353	00:24:06	00:24:08	She worked in a sex club, it could be caused by anything.
354	00:24:08	00:24:10	Like a straw?
355	00:24:10	00:24:14	Maybe I lack imagination but why would you need a straw at a sex club?
356	00:24:14	00:24:16	Well, it's not a sex club, actually.
357	00:24:16	00:24:17	It's a fetish club.
358	00:24:17	00:24:18	There's a difference?
359	00:24:18	00:24:21	Like a straw is not used for sipping Mint Juleps.
360	00:24:21	00:24:22	Cocaine?
361	00:24:23	00:24:25	Air.
362	00:24:27	00:24:30	Anything from last night would be in here.
363	00:24:30	00:24:32	Masks, the usual accouterment.
364	00:24:32	00:24:34	We don't technically have a warrant.
365	00:24:35	00:24:36	Not necessary.
366	00:24:36	00:24:37	I want to help.
367	00:24:46	00:24:48	Go ahead, ask.
368	00:24:48	00:24:50	How can I do this for a living?
369	00:24:50	00:24:53	Oh, that's not what I was thinking.
370	00:24:55	00:24:56	How much does this place clear a week?
371	00:24:57	00:24:59	Ten grand.
372	00:24:59	00:25:02	I'm not with the IRS.
373	00:25:02	00:25:03	Okay, 20.
374	00:25:03	00:25:07	I don't make that in three months.
375	00:25:07	00:25:11	Sex pays a lot better than death.
376	00:25:11	00:25:12	Plus the outfits are cooler.
377	00:25:12	00:25:14	Well, I have this genius tailor.
378	00:25:14	00:25:17	Worked at the Desert Inn back in the day.
379	00:25:17	00:25:20	I let him come in weekends and play human ashtray.
380	00:25:20	00:25:22	He designs for me and my girls.
381	00:25:22	00:25:23	It's a fair trade.
382	00:25:23	00:25:25	You got a good thing going here.
383	00:25:25	00:25:31	And the best part is, these guys think getting slapped around and being humiliated is their fantasy.
384	00:25:31	00:25:33	It's like I always tell my daughter...
385	00:25:33	00:25:34	You got a daughter?
386	00:25:34	00:25:36	18 this month; freshman at Harvard.
387	00:25:36	00:25:37	Really?
388	00:25:39	00:25:40	Mine's seven.
389	00:25:40	00:25:42	Oh, that's a great age.
390	00:25:42	00:25:43	Yeah.
391	00:25:43	00:25:51	When I thought Zoe was ready to hear it I told her, Honey, there are a lot of things you can give a man your body, your time, even your heart.
392	00:25:51	00:25:56	But the one thing you can never, ever, ever let go of is your power.
393	00:25:58	00:26:04	All my mother ever told me was cash up front.
394	00:26:04	00:26:08	Don't take this the wrong way but I think you've got everything it takes to make a great dominatrix.
395	00:26:08	00:26:10	I take that as a compliment.
396	00:26:10	00:26:11	Well, you should.
397	00:26:11	00:26:20	It's just about knowing yourself, being strong and not taking any crap from powerful jerks who are used to giving it all day long.
398	00:26:20	00:26:25	Well, death is still a man's business and I don't have to tell you about police work.
399	00:26:25	00:26:27	So, how do you survive?
400	00:26:27	00:26:32	By knowing myself and working hard...
401	00:26:32	00:26:37	and by not taking any crap from powerful jerks who are used to giving it all day long.
402	00:26:42	00:26:45	Well, these are masks and straws I took out of the sink at Lady Heather's.
403	00:26:45	00:26:47	None of which have been washed.
404	00:26:47	00:26:49	Mona was a dominatrix at the fetish club.
405	00:26:49	00:26:53	But my guess is that she was a switch for her off-the-books clients.
406	00:26:54	00:26:57	You know what a switch is?
407	00:26:57	00:26:59	Someone who's dominant as well as submissive.
408	00:26:59	00:27:02	Oh, he's even got the lingo down.
409	00:27:04	00:27:09	If Mona's DNA is in one of these masks then she was the submissive on the night she died.
410	00:27:09	00:27:15	You're so dialed into this case I bet you don't need me to tell you which mask had her DNA.
411	00:27:15	00:27:16	Yes, I do, Greg.
412	00:27:16	00:27:20	I also need to know which straw she used.
413	00:27:23	00:27:25	Oh, nice. Mmm.
414	00:27:25	00:27:27	Yeah, that's the idea, Greg.
415	00:27:27	00:27:29	Two straws per mask.
416	00:27:35	00:27:36	You can't get any air through pens.
417	00:27:36	00:27:38	And not much more through straws.
418	00:27:38	00:27:41	And even less if someone's finger is on the other end.
419	00:27:43	00:27:47	I found the victim's DNA on this mask and...
420	00:27:48	00:27:49	these two straws.
421	00:27:49	00:27:54	victim; blue mark Our killer.
422	00:27:54	00:27:56	Now we just need a suspect.
423	00:28:05	00:28:07	You got the yin.
424	00:28:07	00:28:10	I got the yang.
425	00:28:10	00:28:13	Actually, I've got the yang and you've got the yin.
426	00:28:13	00:28:16	At least as far our watch molds go.
427	00:28:16	00:28:18	So that's from her wrist.
428	00:28:19	00:28:21	No air bubbles. Good job.
429	00:28:21	00:28:23	Thank you.
430	00:28:23	00:28:26	Now we'll see how yours turns out.
431	00:28:30	00:28:33	Wow.
432	00:28:33	00:28:36	Looks like there's a few carats around that bezel.
433	00:28:37	00:28:38	And the band.
434	00:28:38	00:28:42	Major bucks.
435	00:28:42	00:28:45	Oh, and, uh, Computer Graphics keyed up this Mideo System.
436	00:28:45	00:28:47	Just hit it.
437	00:28:49	00:28:51	Yin and yang.
438	00:28:51	00:28:52	Top and bottom.
439	00:28:52	00:28:55	It's definitely not a man's watch.
440	00:29:04	00:29:07	You know any fine jewelers?
441	00:29:07	00:29:09	You have my pants?
442	00:29:09	00:29:12	You know, I wake up, I look around I can't find my damn pants.
443	00:29:12	00:29:14	You can't wear them out of here.
444	00:29:14	00:29:16	So what, you want them as a souvenir?
445	00:29:16	00:29:17	I want my stuff.
446	00:29:17	00:29:19	Let's start talking about your pistol.
447	00:29:19	00:29:20	I have one gun.
448	00:29:20	00:29:22	It wouldn't happen to be a Colt.
449	00:29:22	00:29:24	It's on a shelf behind the cash register.
450	00:29:24	00:29:25	Ay, mi hermano.
451	00:29:25	00:29:27	I was so worried about you.
452	00:29:28	00:29:29	Me, too, Papi, huh?
453	00:29:29	00:29:30	Hey, don't worry.
454	00:29:30	00:29:32	Doctor said everything is going to be okay.
455	00:29:34	00:29:36	Burglary?
456	00:29:36	00:29:38	In this neighborhood?
457	00:29:39	00:29:41	Well, are you missing any personal property?
458	00:29:41	00:29:43	Jewelry? Small valuables?
459	00:29:43	00:29:46	No.
460	00:29:46	00:29:49	My wife didn't mention anything either.
461	00:29:49	00:29:50	Again?
462	00:29:51	00:29:52	Look, I'm sorry.
463	00:29:52	00:29:54	I have to go change Dylan.
464	00:29:54	00:30:00	Before you do... in the last year did you buy a diamond watch at Maarten's Jewelers at the Forum Shops?
465	00:30:00	00:30:05	Yeah, in my spare time between the grocery store and the park and Baby Jamboree.
466	00:30:05	00:30:08	No, no, this... this is my life. Sorry.
467	00:30:08	00:30:10	Thanks for you help.
468	00:30:13	00:30:16	Why do men always make everything look so tough?
469	00:30:18	00:30:21	If the dad didn't buy the watch then the mom did.
470	00:30:21	00:30:22	Brass has the credit card receipt.
471	00:30:22	00:30:25	A $20,000 watch and he didn't discuss it?
472	00:30:25	00:30:27	He's lying.
473	00:30:27	00:30:30	I thought my husband answered all your questions.
474	00:30:30	00:30:31	He tried.
475	00:30:31	00:30:32	Gustav Stickley.
476	00:30:32	00:30:35	Very nice furniture.
477	00:30:35	00:30:37	No pictures of your family though.
478	00:30:37	00:30:38	I know what they look like.
479	00:30:38	00:30:41	Most people keep pictures of their loved ones in their office.
480	00:30:41	00:30:43	Well, I would hope that I'm not like most people.
481	00:30:43	00:30:44	Is there a point to this?
482	00:30:44	00:30:49	Did you order a $20,000 custom-made watch from a jeweler at the Forum shops?
483	00:30:49	00:30:51	I did. Is there a problem?
484	00:30:51	00:30:53	No. We'd just like to see it.
485	00:30:54	00:30:55	Do you have a warrant?
486	00:30:55	00:30:56	Do we need one?
487	00:30:56	00:30:59	The truth is, I lost it on a business trip.
488	00:30:59	00:31:01	I'm waiting to find out from the hotel if they found it.
489	00:31:01	00:31:03	Is that the trip that you took L.A.
490	00:31:03	00:31:04	with your boss Ronald?
491	00:31:04	00:31:06	Let me refresh your memory.
492	00:31:06	00:31:08	You shared a suite.
493	00:31:08	00:31:10	Very cost-effective.
494	00:31:10	00:31:12	What'd you save there, $200, $300?
495	00:31:14	00:31:16	I'm a corporate litigator.
496	00:31:16	00:31:18	It's going to take a lot more than that to rattle my cage.
497	00:31:21	00:31:22	Okay.
498	00:31:22	00:31:24	How about this?
499	00:31:24	00:31:28	Are you familiar with the gal who calls herself Lady Heather?
500	00:31:28	00:31:30	No.
501	00:31:30	00:31:35	One of the girls who works for Lady Heather was found dead with an imprint of your watch on her wrist.
502	00:31:36	00:31:38	That's why we'd like a sample of your DNA.
503	00:31:39	00:31:40	That's a big leap.
504	00:31:40	00:31:43	Lost watch to a DNA request.
505	00:31:43	00:31:45	I think we're done here.
506	00:31:48	00:31:49	What do you know about the money bag?
507	00:31:49	00:31:51	Clean cut, quick way in.
508	00:31:51	00:31:54	Can you tell us anything about the tool that may have been used?
509	00:31:54	00:31:55	BFK.
510	00:31:55	00:31:56	Big knife. Great.
511	00:31:58	00:31:59	Tell us something we don't know.
512	00:31:59	00:32:02	I found materials on the cut.
513	00:32:02	00:32:03	Nice.
514	00:32:07	00:32:10	Got to be transferred from the knife.
515	00:32:10	00:32:12	Red fibers.
516	00:32:12	00:32:14	All uniform length.
517	00:32:14	00:32:17	The refractive index of the fibers is 1.544.
518	00:32:17	00:32:19	It's a synthetic. Fiberglass.
519	00:32:19	00:32:21	Like the insulation in my attic.
520	00:32:21	00:32:22	Close.
521	00:32:22	00:32:28	But those amber beads are a catalyst-- resin-- which causes the fiberglass to harden once it's poured into a mold.
522	00:32:28	00:32:29	A mold?
523	00:32:29	00:32:31	To make what?
524	00:32:37	00:32:39	There's three fiberglass manufacturers in Vegas.
525	00:32:39	00:32:41	This is the largest one for prefab baths and showers.
526	00:32:42	00:32:43	24 employees.
527	00:32:43	00:32:48	Everybody in the bath business uses isophthalic resin because it's got the highest water resistance.
528	00:32:48	00:32:50	Downside is, the stuff gets everywhere.
529	00:32:50	00:32:51	Hair, clothes, skin...
530	00:32:55	00:32:57	Small world, huh?
531	00:32:58	00:33:00	Hey, that's ironic, Hector.
532	00:33:00	00:33:04	We're investigating your brother-in-law's shooting and look where we end up.
533	00:33:04	00:33:08	We found traces of fiberglass and resin in Santee's money bag.
534	00:33:08	00:33:11	So?
535	00:33:11	00:33:15	So, how many knives in Vegas come into contact with both those materials?
536	00:33:17	00:33:19	Dame la navaja.
537	00:33:25	00:33:27	Thanks.
538	00:33:29	00:33:30	Hey, could be anybody's knife.
539	00:33:30	00:33:32	We also have a tire print.
540	00:33:34	00:33:37	See? You got the wrong car.
541	00:33:37	00:33:39	We never said what model we were looking for.
542	00:33:40	00:33:41	We're looking for a Honda, Hector.
543	00:33:41	00:33:42	Do you have one?
544	00:33:42	00:33:44	Because we can check your house.
545	00:33:44	00:33:45	We can check your neighborhood.
546	00:33:45	00:33:47	Why don't we just start right here in this parking lot?
547	00:34:02	00:34:04	You know it don't look good when you run, man.
548	00:34:04	00:34:06	You want to tell us who that Honda belongs to?
549	00:34:06	00:34:08	I don't know.
550	00:34:08	00:34:09	Okay, okay! It's a friend of mine.
551	00:34:09	00:34:10	He told me nobody would get hurt.
552	00:34:10	00:34:12	I guess that makes everything okay.
553	00:34:16	00:34:17	You again?
554	00:34:17	00:34:19	I thought you people would've gotten the message.
555	00:34:19	00:34:20	Oh, we did.
556	00:34:20	00:34:23	We also got a warrant.
557	00:34:26	00:34:28	Is this some kind of joke?
558	00:34:28	00:34:30	This is limited to my watch box.
559	00:34:30	00:34:32	Sometimes that's all it takes.
560	00:34:33	00:34:35	Eilene, honey, everything okay?
561	00:34:35	00:34:37	Cameron, go see what Dylan needs.
562	00:34:40	00:34:43	I think my watch box is in my glove compartment.
563	00:34:43	00:34:45	Is the watch in the box?
564	00:34:59	00:35:00	Latex.
565	00:35:01	00:35:04	Like Hansel and Gretel we just followed the bread crumbs all the way home.
566	00:35:14	00:35:15	Afternoon tea.
567	00:35:15	00:35:17	How nice.
568	00:35:19	00:35:21	I like a bit of civility before dark...
569	00:35:21	00:35:24	when all the needy little boys show up.
570	00:35:24	00:35:26	Well, I'm a little needy myself today.
571	00:35:26	00:35:30	My lab pulled skin cells from Mona Taylor's straws.
572	00:35:30	00:35:32	A DNA sample?
573	00:35:34	00:35:36	I have several clients in law enforcement.
574	00:35:37	00:35:38	X-X OR X-Y?
575	00:35:38	00:35:40	They're male.
576	00:35:43	00:35:47	Have you ever seen either of these two people?
577	00:35:47	00:35:49	Not the wife but I have seen the husband.
578	00:35:50	00:35:52	I didn't say they were married.
579	00:35:52	00:35:53	It's obvious.
580	00:35:53	00:35:57	Look at the way he's clenching her hand with both of his and leaning toward her.
581	00:35:57	00:36:01	And see how she's twisting away presenting herself to the wealthy alpha male?
582	00:36:01	00:36:04	She's insensitive; he's insecure.
583	00:36:04	00:36:06	That's a setup for matrimony, not passion.
584	00:36:06	00:36:11	She wants the dominant male to choose her so she can stop being dominant.
585	00:36:14	00:36:15	You're very good.
586	00:36:15	00:36:16	You could work for me.
587	00:36:16	00:36:19	You want to be my boss?
588	00:36:21	00:36:22	You never know.
589	00:36:22	00:36:25	We both might learn something.
590	00:36:25	00:36:27	Oh, I'm sure of that.
591	00:36:30	00:36:34	I can read anyone who walks through this door and know their desires.
592	00:36:34	00:36:36	Sometimes even before they do.
593	00:36:36	00:36:40	Why do you think I selected china and table linens?
594	00:36:40	00:36:43	You like fine things.
595	00:36:43	00:36:45	Or maybe I knew you'd like them.
596	00:36:46	00:36:51	Same way I know you enjoy most of the superficial trappings of civilization.
597	00:36:52	00:36:54	I'm that obvious, huh?
598	00:36:55	00:36:56	Only because you try not to be.
599	00:36:56	00:37:02	You spend your life uncovering what goes on beneath the surface of civility and acceptable behavior.
600	00:37:02	00:37:11	So it's a release for you to indulge in something like high tea when it seems, if only for a moment the world really is civilized.
601	00:37:15	00:37:18	The most telling thing about anyone is what scares them.
602	00:37:19	00:37:23	And I know what you fear more than anything, Mr. Grissom.
603	00:37:25	00:37:27	Which is?
604	00:37:27	00:37:28	Being known.
605	00:37:28	00:37:36	You can't accept that I might know what you really desire, because that would mean that I know you.
606	00:37:36	00:37:40	Something, for whatever reason you spend your entire life making sure no one else does.
607	00:37:44	00:37:47	Lady Heather, you're an anthropologist.
608	00:37:47	00:37:50	More tea?
609	00:37:54	00:37:55	But, see, I could give the money back.
610	00:37:55	00:37:57	But my wife doesn't even know it.
611	00:37:57	00:38:00	If I, like, give the money back to her brother I could go home, right?
612	00:38:00	00:38:01	Right?!
613	00:38:01	00:38:06	Tell us how it happened-- then we'll talk about the future.
614	00:38:08	00:38:14	When I picked Carla up from work on Wednesday I doubled back and I lifted the piece that Santee keeps by the register.
615	00:38:14	00:38:16	I figured I'd return it Friday.
616	00:38:16	00:38:17	Nobody would know.
617	00:38:17	00:38:19	Pretty smart, Hector.
618	00:38:19	00:38:23	I couldn't use my car 'cause Santee knew my car so I hit up on a buddy.
619	00:38:26	00:38:27	Maricon!
620	00:38:27	00:38:29	No... Ow!
621	00:38:37	00:38:40	Look, it's not like they're out of anything.
622	00:38:40	00:38:41	They're insured.
623	00:38:41	00:38:44	For the money and his health.
624	00:38:44	00:38:46	Nobody loses.
625	00:38:47	00:38:49	So can I go now?
626	00:38:49	00:38:53	Hector's my husband but I hope you keep him in jail a long time.
627	00:38:53	00:38:55	He's not going anywhere, right?
628	00:38:55	00:38:57	You commit a crime, you pay the price.
629	00:38:57	00:38:58	You got that right.
630	00:38:58	00:39:03	Oh, by the way we found the $5,000 you skimmed from this business in your jeans pocket.
631	00:39:03	00:39:05	What?
632	00:39:12	00:39:15	You self-righteous bastard.
633	00:39:15	00:39:20	You stand there and bad-mouth my husband while you're robbing me behind my back?
634	00:39:20	00:39:22	I was just borrowing it, I swear.
635	00:39:23	00:39:25	You going to arrest his ass?
636	00:39:25	00:39:27	Yeah.
637	00:39:42	00:39:43	They had a warrant.
638	00:39:43	00:39:44	I didn't want to bother you at work.
639	00:39:45	00:39:47	This qualifies a harassment suit.
640	00:39:47	00:39:49	Too late.
641	00:39:50	00:39:52	Grains of golden sand.
642	00:39:52	00:39:53	What?
643	00:39:53	00:39:54	Edgar Allan Poe.
644	00:39:54	00:39:56	Another man who was familiar with murder.
645	00:39:58	00:40:00	Played in any sandboxes lately, Mr. Nelson?
646	00:40:01	00:40:05	As my husband's attorney I'm advising him not to speak with you.
647	00:40:05	00:40:07	Eilene...
648	00:40:07	00:40:08	Shut up, Cameron.
649	00:40:09	00:40:10	I'll handle this.
650	00:40:11	00:40:13	No.
651	00:40:13	00:40:16	No, I will not shut up.
652	00:40:18	00:40:19	I didn't ask you to be my attorney.
653	00:40:19	00:40:21	You're just doing this to look out for yourself.
654	00:40:22	00:40:23	I'm looking out for our family.
655	00:40:23	00:40:24	I'm the only one that's qualified.
656	00:40:24	00:40:25	Really?
657	00:40:26	00:40:29	And how exactly is sleeping with Ronald looking after your family?
658	00:40:29	00:40:31	Cameron...
659	00:40:31	00:40:33	Cameron what? What?
660	00:40:33	00:40:35	You never gave a damn about me.
661	00:40:35	00:40:36	And our child...
662	00:40:37	00:40:39	Our child is just some yuppie pet designed to make you look better at the firm.
663	00:40:39	00:40:42	Which happens to be the only family you probably really care about.
664	00:40:42	00:40:45	Mr. Nelson, you're very emotional right now.
665	00:40:45	00:40:47	Why don't you just take a moment collect yourself.
666	00:40:47	00:40:49	Let me get you a glass of water.
667	00:40:49	00:40:51	No! No water, no gum, no anything.
668	00:40:51	00:40:55	If you think you can trick him into giving you some DNA, you're mistaken.
669	00:41:03	00:41:05	Liquid latex.
670	00:41:08	00:41:10	What is that supposed to mean?
671	00:41:10	00:41:14	Your husband made Mona Taylor wear it every time that he paid to humiliate her.
672	00:41:15	00:41:17	Why would he do that?
673	00:41:17	00:41:20	Psychologically, she was a surrogate.
674	00:41:20	00:41:22	In fetish club terms, she was a slave.
675	00:41:22	00:41:31	Cameron would put a mask on her face and cover her body in liquid latex.
676	00:41:43	00:41:48	He made her into nothing in order to make her into you.
677	00:41:48	00:41:49	My watch.
678	00:41:49	00:41:51	I guess that made it more real.
679	00:41:51	00:41:56	Cameron couldn't dominate you so he dominated Mona.
680	00:41:56	00:42:00	Only his last appointment he got carried away.
681	00:42:00	00:42:02	Corporate bitch!
682	00:42:02	00:42:05	You still think you're too good to touch your own husband?
683	00:42:05	00:42:06	How about I make you beg for air?
684	00:42:06	00:42:07	Huh?
685	00:42:07	00:42:10	How about I make you... beg for it?!
686	00:42:13	00:42:16	Are you begging for it? Huh?
687	00:42:16	00:42:18	I can't hear you, Eilene.
688	00:42:29	00:42:34	I had to pay some girl to pretend to be my wife.
689	00:42:34	00:42:39	If this is all that you have, I am...
690	00:42:39	00:42:42	happy to go to trial.
691	00:42:42	00:42:47	Mrs. Nelson, we're going to match Cameron's epithelials to the ones on the end of the straws.
692	00:42:47	00:42:49	Wait, wait, wait.
693	00:42:49	00:42:50	Epithelials-- that's like DNA, right?
694	00:42:50	00:42:51	That's DNA?
695	00:42:53	00:42:55	Okay, I got an idea.
696	00:42:55	00:42:57	Why don't we test little Dylan's epithelials?
697	00:42:57	00:43:00	See if his daddy isn't really your law partner.
698	00:43:00	00:43:05	'Cause, God knows, you haven't let me touch you in three years.
699	00:43:07	00:43:08	I'm out of here.
700	00:43:09	00:43:10	Where are you going?
701	00:43:10	00:43:11	Away from you.
702	00:43:12	00:43:14	Other than that, I really don't care.
703	00:43:26	00:43:30	I just realized that you and I have a very healthy relationship.
704	00:43:30	00:43:32	We do?
705	00:43:32	00:43:37	Well, when we have a problem I don't paint Greg Sanders in latex and stick a straw up his nose.
706	00:43:37	00:43:39	Good. He'd probably like it.
707	00:43:39	00:43:45	Gil... you're supposed to say something revealing back to me.
708	00:43:46	00:43:50	Okay. I never told anybody this, Catherine.
