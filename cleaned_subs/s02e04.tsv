0	00:00:14	00:00:17	...I'm telling you, man.
1	00:00:17	00:00:18	See ya, bro.
2	00:00:18	00:00:20	Later, losers.
3	00:01:02	00:01:03	Barry Schickel.
4	00:01:03	00:01:06	Wallet still with him, with cash.
5	00:01:06	00:01:07	A student.
6	00:01:07	00:01:09	Recently voted Class Clown.
7	00:01:13	00:01:14	Strange...
8	00:01:14	00:01:18	People aren't usually scared of class clowns.
9	00:01:20	00:01:21	Who said his shooter was scared?
10	00:01:21	00:01:24	Shot him in the back.
11	00:01:24	00:01:27	With his zipper down and hands otherwise engaged.
12	00:01:27	00:01:30	Yeah.
13	00:01:30	00:01:31	We're looking for a coward.
14	00:02:15	00:02:17	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...
15	00:02:17	00:02:18	What're you doing?
16	00:02:18	00:02:19	Removing graffiti.
17	00:02:19	00:02:22	There's been a murder here, nothing gets cleaned.
18	00:02:22	00:02:23	It's school policy, Miss.
19	00:02:23	00:02:25	I have to get the graffiti down as soon...
20	00:02:25	00:02:26	Everything is evidence.
21	00:02:26	00:02:28	Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
22	00:02:28	00:02:29	Should we call the Sheriff?
23	00:02:33	00:02:35	No.
24	00:02:35	00:02:36	Thank you.
25	00:02:40	00:02:42	Bet you were like that in high school.
26	00:02:42	00:02:43	Worse.
27	00:02:43	00:02:45	Ooh... You were the girl I ran away from.
28	00:02:45	00:02:49	Yeah, till you caught me.
29	00:02:49	00:02:52	45?
30	00:02:52	00:02:53	That's right.
31	00:02:53	00:02:57	And it was okay for a student like the victim to return to the school property to use the restroom?
32	00:02:58	00:02:59	That wasn't out of the ordinary?
33	00:02:59	00:03:00	Hand me a bindle.
34	00:03:00	00:03:07	The place isn't locked up till the janitor leaves 00-8 the kids at after-school events use the facilities.
35	00:03:07	00:03:08	Brass.
36	00:03:08	00:03:13	Excuse me, one of my students is dead are we interrupting you?
37	00:03:13	00:03:15	Yeah, a little.
38	00:03:15	00:03:19	That's okay, I'll drop by your office.
39	00:03:19	00:03:21	We'll finish this up.
40	00:03:23	00:03:26	You found the slug.
41	00:03:28	00:03:31	So the treasure hunt paid off, huh?
42	00:03:31	00:03:32	Yeah, it better.
43	00:03:32	00:03:34	We have a point of reference.
44	00:03:34	00:03:36	Well, the nerd squad is off and running.
45	00:03:37	00:03:41	I'm going to burn a little shoe leather; see if the vic had a beef with anyone.
46	00:03:44	00:03:47	Rescue One, approaching drop site.
47	00:03:52	00:03:54	We have a visual, Baker One.
48	00:03:54	00:03:56	Stand by for eastern approach.
49	00:04:03	00:04:05	CSI, ready for descent.
50	00:04:06	00:04:08	You're good to go!
51	00:04:08	00:04:10	Okay, there he is!
52	00:04:10	00:04:11	Let's get down there.
53	00:04:14	00:04:16	Ready?
54	00:04:16	00:04:18	I'll race you.
55	00:04:21	00:04:23	They're sliding through the air.
56	00:04:26	00:04:28	CSI is on the ground.
57	00:04:30	00:04:33	Stokes, Sidle Crime Lab.
58	00:04:33	00:04:34	Did you open the bag?
59	00:04:34	00:04:36	Long enough to see one gnarly looking hand.
60	00:04:36	00:04:38	Well, skeleton of a hand.
61	00:04:42	00:04:43	Anyone touch the bag since?
62	00:04:43	00:04:45	With that smell?
63	00:04:45	00:04:47	I thought you Emergency Service guys were tougher than that.
64	00:04:47	00:04:49	Hey, I'm plenty tough.
65	00:04:49	00:04:51	Down, boy it was a joke.
66	00:04:52	00:04:55	Nothing like flirting over a D.B.
67	00:04:57	00:04:59	You want to airlift the body to the Coroner's?
68	00:04:59	00:05:01	We'll radio ahead?
69	00:05:01	00:05:02	Sure.
70	00:05:02	00:05:03	Wait.
71	00:05:06	00:05:07	Are you supposed to do that already?
72	00:05:07	00:05:11	Body's Coroner's, property's ours.
73	00:05:27	00:05:28	We have the basket.
74	00:05:28	00:05:30	Copy that.
75	00:05:32	00:05:35	Rescue One returning to base.
76	00:05:39	00:05:40	Hi.
77	00:05:40	00:05:42	Construction on Flamingo. Sorry.
78	00:05:42	00:05:44	Give me a hand, will you?
79	00:05:44	00:05:46	Yeah.
80	00:05:48	00:05:49	A .38?
81	00:05:49	00:05:52	.44.
82	00:05:52	00:05:53	Here, take this.
83	00:05:57	00:06:00	Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right?
84	00:06:00	00:06:02	Orange, by my kit.
85	00:06:02	00:06:04	It was in his backpack.
86	00:06:09	00:06:11	Did you get something?
87	00:06:11	00:06:13	Paint from another source.
88	00:06:13	00:06:16	I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker.
89	00:06:18	00:06:20	Kind of weird being in a high school, huh?
90	00:06:20	00:06:22	They do have a timeless quality.
91	00:06:22	00:06:24	What were you? A jock or a brain?
92	00:06:24	00:06:26	I was a ghost.
93	00:06:26	00:06:27	There.
94	00:06:31	00:06:32	Shooter was standing right there.
95	00:06:46	00:06:47	And...?
96	00:06:47	00:06:52	Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking...
97	00:06:52	00:06:54	Five-four...
98	00:06:54	00:06:55	maybe three.
99	00:06:55	00:06:56	We got ourselves a shorty.
100	00:06:58	00:07:01	Let's see what metal shows up.
101	00:07:03	00:07:05	Well, there's no gun on our dead body.
102	00:07:05	00:07:08	Wouldn't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in?
103	00:07:08	00:07:11	I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps.
104	00:07:13	00:07:17	I see a coin. Looks like a half dollar.
105	00:07:17	00:07:19	Silver, whole.
106	00:07:19	00:07:21	I've done a few of these.
107	00:07:22	00:07:24	What's that?
108	00:07:24	00:07:26	There. About four inches long. What is that?
109	00:07:27	00:07:28	It looks like a pin.
110	00:07:28	00:07:29	It's a medical implant.
111	00:07:32	00:07:34	Oh, and that's a plate in the skull.
112	00:07:34	00:07:36	The head's been rolled.
113	00:07:36	00:07:38	I'd say we're dealing with a male.
114	00:07:38	00:07:41	Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months.
115	00:07:41	00:07:42	Sound?
116	00:07:43	00:07:45	You weren't here when ESD brought this in.
117	00:07:45	00:07:48	Well, it wasn't from lack of trying.
118	00:07:51	00:07:52	Let's go to the VIP room.
119	00:07:52	00:07:55	I'll show you what I mean.
120	00:07:59	00:08:01	That's Dennis Fram's locker.
121	00:08:01	00:08:05	And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before?
122	00:08:05	00:08:08	Look, I'm the school counselor I don't know every move these kids make.
123	00:08:08	00:08:11	Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead.
124	00:08:13	00:08:16	Tell me what stick means.
125	00:08:20	00:08:24	Is that a polymer sensor proboscis?
126	00:08:24	00:08:26	Cyranose 320.
127	00:08:26	00:08:29	Company sent it to me, gratis for a week.
128	00:08:29	00:08:31	They figure if it helps CSI will buy one.
129	00:08:31	00:08:33	Electronic noses run like ten grand.
130	00:08:33	00:08:41	Yeah, well, what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?
131	00:08:41	00:08:47	If that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in the ass the county would not approve a $10,000 purchase order.
132	00:08:47	00:08:52	I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took.
133	00:08:52	00:08:54	And to hell with the budgets.
134	00:08:54	00:08:56	Our job is to think, Warrick.
135	00:08:56	00:08:59	Machinery should never matter more than our mind.
136	00:09:01	00:09:02	Try this.
137	00:09:05	00:09:07	Glass tube.
138	00:09:07	00:09:08	Air pump.
139	00:09:08	00:09:09	Air pump.
140	00:09:09	00:09:11	Cost about ten bucks.
141	00:09:11	00:09:14	Absorption agent?
142	00:09:14	00:09:18	Fresh out. Improvise.
143	00:09:22	00:09:27	And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year.
144	00:09:27	00:09:31	He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build.
145	00:09:31	00:09:33	Skinny, shorty that kind of thing.
146	00:09:33	00:09:36	Dennis is slight and Barry always picks on him for it.
147	00:09:36	00:09:38	Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?
148	00:09:38	00:09:40	Of course, but he would never hurt Barry.
149	00:09:41	00:09:42	He's a good kid.
150	00:09:42	00:09:44	He's totally nonviolent.
151	00:09:44	00:09:46	Well, then, this will be brief.
152	00:09:49	00:09:53	We can call him from my office.
153	00:09:53	00:09:54	Cathy, you coming?
154	00:09:55	00:09:57	Oh, I'll catch up to you.
155	00:10:01	00:10:02	Hey...
156	00:10:02	00:10:04	I need to talk to you.
157	00:10:04	00:10:06	I didn't clean anything.
158	00:10:06	00:10:08	It's not about that.
159	00:10:09	00:10:10	How tall are you, Dennis?
160	00:10:13	00:10:15	Five-three and one quarter.
161	00:10:17	00:10:19	Have you washed your hands in the last hour?
162	00:10:19	00:10:21	Yeah. Why?
163	00:10:21	00:10:23	Changed your shirt?
164	00:10:23	00:10:25	No.
165	00:10:25	00:10:27	I'd like to do a test on your shirt if I may.
166	00:10:27	00:10:29	What kind of test?
167	00:10:29	00:10:30	Forensic.
168	00:10:51	00:10:53	What is that?
169	00:10:53	00:10:54	G.S.R.
170	00:10:54	00:11:00	When someone fires a weapon gunshot residue plumes back onto their hands and clothing.
171	00:11:05	00:11:08	This means that you fired a gun within the last three to six hours.
172	00:11:08	00:11:09	Dennis...
173	00:11:09	00:11:11	The police are going to want to talk to you.
174	00:11:14	00:11:16	So, you admit you fired a gun.
175	00:11:16	00:11:18	I was over at the shooting range on Desert Way.
176	00:11:18	00:11:23	So the same night that Barry Schickel was shot and killed you were out taking target practice?
177	00:11:23	00:11:24	I go every Monday night.
178	00:11:24	00:11:26	You can ask my sister. She goes with me.
179	00:11:26	00:11:28	Where's your gun?
180	00:11:28	00:11:29	I rent different ones there.
181	00:11:29	00:11:31	Did you ever rent a .44 caliber?
182	00:11:31	00:11:34	Sometimes.
183	00:11:34	00:11:36	I'm going to see my brother!
184	00:11:36	00:11:38	Get out of the way!
185	00:11:38	00:11:40	Denny, are you okay? Got your call.
186	00:11:40	00:11:41	I'm fine, I'm fine.
187	00:11:41	00:11:43	We're conducting a police investigation here.
188	00:11:43	00:11:47	My dad's back in town tonight and you'll be sorry you harassed my little brother.
189	00:11:47	00:11:48	Questioned.
190	00:11:49	00:11:52	A student was shot and killed in this building tonight.
191	00:11:52	00:11:53	You know what?
192	00:11:53	00:11:56	Dennis has explained to you about the gunpowder.
193	00:11:56	00:11:59	and I am sure his sister will vouch for his whereabouts.
194	00:11:59	00:12:00	And he's a minor.
195	00:12:00	00:12:01	Jim.
196	00:12:01	00:12:04	We'll be in touch.
197	00:12:09	00:12:12	Remember, breathe through your mouth.
198	00:12:28	00:12:29	Metal plate.
199	00:12:34	00:12:36	Silver dollar.
200	00:12:42	00:12:44	Gambling chip.
201	00:12:46	00:12:47	And...
202	00:12:48	00:12:51	Aah.
203	00:12:51	00:12:54	Jacket government issue, Army.
204	00:12:54	00:12:56	Ugh.
205	00:12:57	00:12:58	Pile of bones and that's it.
206	00:12:58	00:13:00	That's it?
207	00:13:00	00:13:03	No organs no-no tonsils, no...
208	00:13:05	00:13:08	...soup?
209	00:13:08	00:13:09	Human soup.
210	00:13:09	00:13:13	Well, we are 73.5% liquid, eh, Dave?
211	00:13:13	00:13:17	Add some bacteria, a couple gases, and... voila!
212	00:13:17	00:13:20	Okay, I'll take Liquid Man's jacket, see what I can find.
213	00:13:20	00:13:22	I'll cremate this.
214	00:13:22	00:13:23	What if we find the family or they find us?
215	00:13:24	00:13:27	A decomp this bad can stink up the entire building forever.
216	00:13:27	00:13:29	The sooner we dispose of this, the better.
217	00:13:29	00:13:32	Not for our investigation.
218	00:13:32	00:13:33	Sorry.
219	00:13:37	00:13:41	Let me guess. Decomp in an enclosed space?
220	00:13:41	00:13:42	Yeah.
221	00:13:42	00:13:43	Yeah, in a zip bag.
222	00:13:43	00:13:45	Lemons.
223	00:13:45	00:13:47	Lemons?
224	00:13:47	00:13:49	What?
225	00:13:49	00:13:51	Use lemons.
226	00:13:51	00:13:54	Huh. Hmm.
227	00:14:52	00:14:54	So how's your new toy working out?
228	00:14:54	00:14:57	It's been downsized.
229	00:14:57	00:14:58	Bummer.
230	00:14:58	00:14:59	I know how you wanted to see that thing work.
231	00:14:59	00:15:04	Well, it's the same difference, really.
232	00:15:04	00:15:10	Air is drawn into the glass tube the chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air.
233	00:15:12	00:15:15	And mass spec'll break it down at the lab.
234	00:15:15	00:15:20	So why did you need the expensive one in the first place?
235	00:15:20	00:15:21	'Cause it was cool.
236	00:15:24	00:15:25	I'll see you in homeroom.
237	00:15:25	00:15:26	All right.
238	00:15:27	00:15:30	Barry Schickel from the high school.
239	00:15:30	00:15:32	Dug three of these .44's from his back.
240	00:15:34	00:15:36	First one cracked his infraspinous fossa.
241	00:15:36	00:15:38	Second one entered...
242	00:15:38	00:15:41	past the interior angle of the scapula punctured a lung.
243	00:15:41	00:15:46	And the last one entered just right of the right anterior sarratus muscle pierced the heart.
244	00:15:47	00:15:49	The heart? That makes no sense.
245	00:15:49	00:15:51	This is a special case.
246	00:15:52	00:15:55	See the scar?
247	00:15:55	00:15:57	This guy was attacked before.
248	00:15:57	00:16:00	I'd say in the last six months.
249	00:16:00	00:16:03	But not with a knife, it looks like prongs.
250	00:16:03	00:16:06	Whatever it was, it would've killed him.
251	00:16:06	00:16:07	If his heart had been there.
252	00:16:09	00:16:11	Where was his heart?
253	00:16:11	00:16:13	Barry's upper body?
254	00:16:13	00:16:19	All his internal organs are on the opposite side of typical placement.
255	00:16:20	00:16:23	Dextrocardia? Like Dr. No?
256	00:16:23	00:16:27	That only presents in, what .01% of the population?
257	00:16:27	00:16:31	Which was good for this guy, until his luck ran out.
258	00:16:35	00:16:37	How long ago did you say he was stabbed?
259	00:16:37	00:16:40	Six months, hand-to-hand combat.
260	00:16:40	00:16:42	Sound like something your suspect would do?
261	00:16:42	00:16:46	No.
262	00:17:03	00:17:05	Hey, how's Liquid Man doing?
263	00:17:05	00:17:09	You mean Mr. Cartsen?
264	00:17:09	00:17:10	I found this, it's a...
265	00:17:10	00:17:12	name tag.
266	00:17:13	00:17:19	You know, Sara, a lot of homeless guys get these Army jackets cheap at salvage stores.
267	00:17:19	00:17:21	Well, it's a start.
268	00:17:22	00:17:27	I'm going to get Homicide to check the VA medical database for a W. Cartsen with plates or pins.
269	00:17:27	00:17:28	Okay.
270	00:17:33	00:17:35	Ugh...
271	00:17:39	00:17:41	What do you got?
272	00:17:41	00:17:42	I don't know.
273	00:17:43	00:17:46	I can't read an address or a phone number... God, it reeks!
274	00:17:46	00:17:49	Q.D. should be able to, uh...
275	00:17:49	00:17:51	to bring something up...
276	00:17:57	00:17:59	Don't tell anyone.
277	00:17:59	00:18:01	About what?
278	00:18:04	00:18:05	Sara?
279	00:18:05	00:18:08	Hi.
280	00:18:08	00:18:10	They told me out front I could find you...
281	00:18:10	00:18:11	here.
282	00:18:11	00:18:13	Yeah.
283	00:18:13	00:18:15	Um...
284	00:18:15	00:18:16	I'll be right out.
285	00:18:18	00:18:20	Give me a mint.
286	00:18:20	00:18:21	You're going to need more than one.
287	00:18:21	00:18:23	Just give me. ( chuckling )
288	00:18:28	00:18:30	This is a nice surprise.
289	00:18:30	00:18:32	I wanted to see if you'd like to have dinner.
290	00:18:32	00:18:33	Yeah.
291	00:18:33	00:18:35	Um... when?
292	00:18:35	00:18:37	Now, I'm on break.
293	00:18:37	00:18:39	Oh, well, I'm in the middle of that D.B. from the gully.
294	00:18:39	00:18:42	He's still a John Doe and we don't know the circumstances.
295	00:18:44	00:18:45	I smell.
296	00:18:45	00:18:47	No...
297	00:18:47	00:18:48	Well, not that bad.
298	00:18:48	00:18:56	I changed clothes-- the problem is that it's human fat reduced and it's attached itself to my follicles and my pores, so...
299	00:18:58	00:18:59	You don't look good.
300	00:18:59	00:19:00	I need to get some air.
301	00:19:00	00:19:01	Okay.
302	00:19:01	00:19:02	Uh, no, you-you stay.
303	00:19:02	00:19:04	Uh, you've got that John Doe to worry about and, uh...
304	00:19:04	00:19:06	Well, I can always stop by another time.
305	00:19:06	00:19:09	Great.
306	00:19:09	00:19:10	Okay.
307	00:19:10	00:19:13	Bye...
308	00:19:17	00:19:18	You smell like death.
309	00:19:18	00:19:21	I've heard.
310	00:19:21	00:19:24	You know, a real man wouldn't mind.
311	00:19:32	00:19:34	Have you talked to Barry's parents?
312	00:19:34	00:19:36	I did; they had no idea he'd been stabbed.
313	00:19:36	00:19:39	The older kids get the less they talk to their parents.
314	00:19:39	00:19:41	They talk to you, though, right?
315	00:19:41	00:19:42	The guidance counselor?
316	00:19:42	00:19:45	Who else may have had it in for Barry Schickel?
317	00:19:45	00:19:49	Look, he was very popular, but he was a bully.
318	00:19:49	00:19:54	So there was probably a dozen kids who wanted to see him dead.
319	00:19:54	00:19:55	Really?
320	00:19:55	00:19:58	I'd be walking by and... he would punch me.
321	00:20:01	00:20:04	Everybody started calling me Flinch.
322	00:20:04	00:20:06	Even the teachers.
323	00:20:06	00:20:08	MOVE!
324	00:20:08	00:20:10	He was the meanest guy I've ever known.
325	00:20:10	00:20:13	But the way he put you down, it sounded funny.
326	00:20:13	00:20:15	If it wasn't you.
327	00:20:15	00:20:18	He'd wait for me, every day.
328	00:20:18	00:20:22	Lunch time, fourth period. Take my food.
329	00:20:22	00:20:24	Yo, hungry? Ha! Thanks for the sandwich.
330	00:20:24	00:20:27	Until I fixed him.
331	00:20:27	00:20:30	It was about half a year ago, I went at him.
332	00:20:30	00:20:32	With a fork?
333	00:20:32	00:20:34	Stabbed him above his left pectoral.
334	00:20:34	00:20:37	Yeah.
335	00:20:37	00:20:39	It still didn't stop him.
336	00:20:39	00:20:43	I mean, today was the first day I could come to school and not feel like a moving target.
337	00:20:43	00:20:46	00?
338	00:20:46	00:20:48	When Barry was shot?
339	00:20:50	00:20:55	Boxing practice.
340	00:20:55	00:20:58	Okay. Thanks.
341	00:21:01	00:21:09	I can protect them from being called a derogatory word for homosexual or the N-word.
342	00:21:09	00:21:11	Everything else falls under free speech.
343	00:21:11	00:21:14	No one's blaming you.
344	00:21:14	00:21:16	I am.
345	00:21:16	00:21:19	You know who did this, don't you?
346	00:21:19	00:21:24	You have no idea what these kids go through.
347	00:21:24	00:21:28	I listen to them every day.
348	00:21:28	00:21:30	Divorce, working parents...
349	00:21:30	00:21:32	Cliques.
350	00:21:32	00:21:36	And all they need is just one person to believe in them.
351	00:21:36	00:21:40	Yeah.
352	00:21:40	00:21:42	But where does that leave Barry Schickel?
353	00:21:42	00:21:45	That's your job.
354	00:21:51	00:21:53	Shut up. She was not.
355	00:21:53	00:21:54	I saw her in action.
356	00:21:54	00:21:56	Really?
357	00:21:56	00:21:57	Yeah, she was.
358	00:21:57	00:21:58	Catherine?
359	00:21:58	00:21:59	I was what?
360	00:22:01	00:22:05	I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully in high school.
361	00:22:05	00:22:06	A bully?
362	00:22:06	00:22:07	All right, I guess I was.
363	00:22:07	00:22:10	But, I mean, not the kind that people want to take a gun out and shoot.
364	00:22:11	00:22:11	No.
365	00:22:12	00:22:12	No, no.
366	00:22:12	00:22:16	You were the kind that guys fall all over themselves trying to impress.
367	00:22:16	00:22:17	Like you, Nick, huh?
368	00:22:20	00:22:23	Oh, Nick, uh... what were you in high school?
369	00:22:23	00:22:26	Me? I was, uh...
370	00:22:26	00:22:28	I was dependable.
371	00:22:28	00:22:29	Dependable.
372	00:22:29	00:22:33	Dependable jock, dependable stoner?
373	00:22:33	00:22:35	No, never a strap, never a smoker.
374	00:22:35	00:22:38	Just all-around dependable guy, I guess.
375	00:22:38	00:22:39	He's trying to say he was unpopular.
376	00:22:40	00:22:43	I was popular with the right people I can tell you that.
377	00:22:43	00:22:45	I can also tell you what I wasn't.
378	00:22:45	00:22:50	I wasn't a Mac Daddy wannabe with a Members Only jacket, putting his swerve on all the ladies.
379	00:22:50	00:22:51	What was wrong with those Members Only jackets?
380	00:22:51	00:22:52	They were kind of cool back in the day.
381	00:22:52	00:22:54	Hey, Nick.
382	00:22:54	00:22:56	Ronnie's got something on Liquid Man, says it's hot.
383	00:22:56	00:22:58	Good.
384	00:22:59	00:23:01	Hey, Sara, what were you in high school?
385	00:23:01	00:23:04	Science nerd.
386	00:23:04	00:23:05	You changed...
387	00:23:05	00:23:08	but you still smell.
388	00:23:08	00:23:09	Let's go.
389	00:23:09	00:23:11	So that leaves you, Warrick.
390	00:23:11	00:23:13	What were you?
391	00:23:13	00:23:18	Oh, I was short, I had big feet, thick glasses.
392	00:23:18	00:23:19	You?!
393	00:23:19	00:23:20	Yeah.
394	00:23:20	00:23:24	I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls.
395	00:23:24	00:23:28	The girls didn't even notice your eyes?
396	00:23:28	00:23:30	No, they used to tease me about my eyes.
397	00:23:30	00:23:31	Called me names.
398	00:23:31	00:23:34	Aw. Well, what do they know?
399	00:23:34	00:23:36	They're your best feature.
400	00:23:36	00:23:38	I didn't have a best feature in high school.
401	00:23:40	00:23:49	Looking back on it now I can say I could see both sides of it thinking about this guy Barry Schickel, and how he was shot and whichever kid did it.
402	00:23:49	00:23:54	I'm not saying it was right, but I kind of understand, you know?
403	00:23:54	00:23:57	Yeah.
404	00:24:04	00:24:09	I wanted to hold off on this matchbook until it dried out but then I realized...
405	00:24:09	00:24:12	Human fat never dries out, it just gets waxy.
406	00:24:12	00:24:13	Exactly.
407	00:24:13	00:24:22	What I'm doing is adding pixels at some points and erasing pixels at other points.
408	00:24:40	00:24:42	Got it.
409	00:24:42	00:24:44	Roma...
410	00:24:44	00:24:46	Roman... nini's...
411	00:24:46	00:24:47	Never heard of it.
412	00:24:47	00:24:49	I have.
413	00:24:49	00:24:51	Nightclub for boomers off the strip.
414	00:24:51	00:24:52	Thanks, man.
415	00:24:52	00:24:53	You bet.
416	00:24:56	00:24:57	Hey, Stokes.
417	00:24:57	00:24:58	Your W. Cartsen?
418	00:24:58	00:24:59	Yeah?
419	00:25:00	00:25:02	He's a Second Lieutenant William Cartsen.
420	00:25:02	00:25:04	Served in the war, wounded in action.
421	00:25:04	00:25:07	Got sent stateside after they put him back together.
422	00:25:07	00:25:11	They put a pin in his spine and a plate in his head 31 years ago.
423	00:25:11	00:25:14	Walked out of the hospital, hasn't been heard of since.
424	00:25:15	00:25:16	Okay. Come with us.
425	00:26:04	00:26:06	What's the matter, you don't trust me?
426	00:26:07	00:26:08	I trust you.
427	00:26:16	00:26:19	I got a boatload of chemical components here.
428	00:26:19	00:26:23	Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars.
429	00:26:23	00:26:26	It's like every guy's bathroom in America.
430	00:26:26	00:26:27	What doesn't belong?
431	00:26:36	00:26:38	How can I help you people?
432	00:26:39	00:26:41	Valet guy said you're the manager.
433	00:26:41	00:26:43	Detective O'Riley, Las Vegas P.D.
434	00:26:44	00:26:45	Stokes and Sidle from the Crime Lab.
435	00:26:45	00:26:46	Crime Lab?
436	00:26:46	00:26:48	What's going on?
437	00:26:48	00:26:50	This man a patron of your establishment?
438	00:26:50	00:26:52	Name's William Cartsen.
439	00:26:52	00:26:54	Not that I recognize, no.
440	00:26:54	00:26:56	Are you sure you haven't seen him around here?
441	00:26:57	00:27:00	Wore an Army jacket, might've been down on his luck?
442	00:27:00	00:27:02	Oh, you mean Moses.
443	00:27:02	00:27:04	Moses?
444	00:27:04	00:27:08	Yeah, guy had a beard down to here, wore a robe the Army jacket.
445	00:27:08	00:27:11	Stood out here scaring every patron I had.
446	00:27:11	00:27:13	Hey!
447	00:27:13	00:27:14	The whole world is watching.
448	00:27:14	00:27:15	Bidi dou!
449	00:27:15	00:27:16	Bidi dou!
450	00:27:16	00:27:18	Guy was ruining my business.
451	00:27:18	00:27:19	So what'd you do?
452	00:27:19	00:27:21	I tried to reason with him.
453	00:27:21	00:27:23	( Moses yells ) Hey!
454	00:27:23	00:27:27	Hey, buddy, you've got to leave my customers alone, okay?
455	00:27:27	00:27:31	Here.
456	00:27:31	00:27:34	Cash that and move on.
457	00:27:34	00:27:35	That's the last I saw of him.
458	00:27:35	00:27:37	When was that?
459	00:27:37	00:27:39	I don't know, about two months ago.
460	00:27:39	00:27:41	That's funny we found his body.
461	00:27:41	00:27:43	Coroner says he's been dead two months.
462	00:27:43	00:27:47	We're going to want you to take a little ride with us.
463	00:27:47	00:27:50	Okay.
464	00:28:01	00:28:04	I checked out those kids you talked to.
465	00:28:04	00:28:09	None of them was even near the school when Barry Schickel was killed.
466	00:28:09	00:28:11	The only one who doesn't check out is Dennis Fram.
467	00:28:11	00:28:13	There's a reason.
468	00:28:13	00:28:14	I can put him at the crime scene.
469	00:28:14	00:28:16	Jim, can you call them from the car?
470	00:28:16	00:28:17	Sure, let's go.
471	00:28:17	00:28:18	Put him there, how?
472	00:28:18	00:28:20	Well, I'll explain on the way.
473	00:28:20	00:28:21	No, no.
474	00:28:21	00:28:23	I'm going to stay here with this, close to Warrick.
475	00:28:23	00:28:26	Okay. But you'll miss all the fireworks.
476	00:28:34	00:28:40	I know I must sound like the typical parent but my son had nothing to do with the death of the Schickel boy.
477	00:28:40	00:28:42	We've placed him at the murder.
478	00:28:42	00:28:43	What?
479	00:28:43	00:28:47	Here's the fingerprint that I recovered from Dennis' locker.
480	00:28:47	00:28:54	These are Dennis' prints on file at school-- the Missing Kids Prevention Drive.
481	00:28:54	00:28:56	There's a match.
482	00:28:56	00:29:00	Well, his own fingerprint on his own locker that doesn't prove anything.
483	00:29:00	00:29:02	Proves a timeline.
484	00:29:02	00:29:08	The alkyd particles in the victim's spray paint adhere and dry in 30 seconds.
485	00:29:10	00:29:11	Oxidation.
486	00:29:11	00:29:19	Dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of Barry putting it on his locker for his print to take.
487	00:29:19	00:29:20	Well, how do you know...?
488	00:29:20	00:29:21	The janitor.
489	00:29:21	00:29:23	He keeps timed records of graffiti.
490	00:29:23	00:29:26	Job security.
491	00:29:26	00:29:31	And Dennis left paint on the door jamb in the bathroom where Barry was shot.
492	00:29:32	00:29:36	That's the timeline of the murder, Mr. Fram.
493	00:29:36	00:29:38	We know every move your son made up until the gun.
494	00:29:38	00:29:40	That's why we want to see your collection.
495	00:29:40	00:29:43	You're registered as having two dozen weapons?
496	00:29:43	00:29:44	Denny?
497	00:29:44	00:29:45	Ow...
498	00:29:45	00:29:47	It's okay, it's okay.
499	00:29:47	00:29:48	Come on.
500	00:29:48	00:29:51	We'll fix it.
501	00:29:56	00:30:01	This... does not belong in a guy's bathroom.
502	00:30:01	00:30:02	Can we prove this?
503	00:30:02	00:30:06	I mean, there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out there.
504	00:30:06	00:30:08	You still got that $10,000 e-nose you were using?
505	00:30:08	00:30:11	Oh, now you want my tricked-out toy.
506	00:30:11	00:30:13	I just want the software.
507	00:30:18	00:30:20	Come on, drink up.
508	00:30:20	00:30:21	Here you go.
509	00:30:21	00:30:24	Good.
510	00:30:26	00:30:29	Just hold this to your face, okay?
511	00:30:29	00:30:30	I'll be right back.
512	00:30:33	00:30:38	He's got a bleeding ulcer from being bullied by Barry Schickel.
513	00:30:42	00:30:44	Hey, shrimp, want to go for a ride?
514	00:30:46	00:30:51	You don't know how hard it was for him every morning trying to work up the courage just to go to school.
515	00:30:58	00:31:01	I thought my little brother was going to kill himself.
516	00:31:01	00:31:03	And then someone killed Barry.
517	00:31:05	00:31:06	Yeah.
518	00:31:06	00:31:09	How tall are you?
519	00:31:09	00:31:12	Five-four... with heels.
520	00:31:14	00:31:16	Why?
521	00:31:16	00:31:19	No reason.
522	00:31:19	00:31:24	You grabbed a top note of floral and now we ask the software to break it into ingredients.
523	00:31:24	00:31:26	Do you recognize any of these?
524	00:31:26	00:31:28	That's all from one perfume?
525	00:31:29	00:31:32	Some of these perfumes have, like, 750 ingredients.
526	00:31:35	00:31:37	Chanteuse.
527	00:31:39	00:31:41	We can narrow it down to one brand?
528	00:31:41	00:31:44	Yeah, the original application for this program was perfume companies.
529	00:31:44	00:31:48	You know, testing new brands stealing from the competition.
530	00:31:50	00:31:52	Grissom.
531	00:31:52	00:31:53	Grissom, we got a suspect.
532	00:31:53	00:31:55	But it's not who you think.
533	00:31:55	00:31:56	Let me guess.
534	00:31:57	00:31:58	Denny Fram's sister?
535	00:31:58	00:32:00	How did you know?
536	00:32:00	00:32:02	Vapor molecules.
537	00:32:02	00:32:05	See if you can get a warrant for her perfume and have Brass bring her in.
538	00:32:05	00:32:07	Her perfume?
539	00:32:07	00:32:09	Let's get back to my first question, Miss Fram.
540	00:32:09	00:32:12	Where were you the night Barry Schickel was killed?
541	00:32:12	00:32:16	I told you, I was out driving around.
542	00:32:16	00:32:22	So what, your perfume just wafted into the boys' room all the way from Highway 10?
543	00:32:22	00:32:26	Yes. I wear Chanteuse.
544	00:32:26	00:32:28	What's that got to do with anything?
545	00:32:28	00:32:34	My mom used to wear it, and... after her car accident I started to wear it.
546	00:32:34	00:32:36	Well, aromas have fingerprints.
547	00:32:36	00:32:41	They're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air, long after the source has gone.
548	00:32:41	00:32:47	We isolated a combination in the restroom where Barry Schickel was shot.
549	00:32:47	00:32:49	It matches your perfume.
550	00:32:49	00:32:50	A high-end woman's perfume.
551	00:32:50	00:32:54	It's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it.
552	00:32:54	00:32:55	Wait, wait, wait...
553	00:32:55	00:32:57	She has no reason to hurt Barry Schickel.
554	00:32:57	00:32:59	What about revenge for her little brother?
555	00:33:00	00:33:01	I can't believe this.
556	00:33:01	00:33:06	That bastard Schickel dogged my family now he's doing it from the grave.
557	00:33:06	00:33:09	Come on, Kelsey.
558	00:33:09	00:33:12	You come near us again you do it through my lawyer.
559	00:33:18	00:33:21	Wears her dead mother's perfume.
560	00:33:21	00:33:22	Nice touch.
561	00:33:24	00:33:25	Might be true.
562	00:33:25	00:33:28	Scent triggers memory more acutely than any of the five senses.
563	00:33:28	00:33:30	Yeah?
564	00:33:30	00:33:34	Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.
565	00:33:39	00:33:39	So you didn't hurt him.
566	00:33:40	00:33:41	You just put him in your car.
567	00:33:41	00:33:42	Is that what you're saying?
568	00:33:42	00:33:44	Back seat. Then I drove him out of town.
569	00:33:44	00:33:46	I left him on the side of the road, out by Red Rock.
570	00:33:47	00:33:52	You didn't maybe zip him up in a bag because he was giving you trouble anything like that?
571	00:33:54	00:33:55	No.
572	00:33:57	00:33:59	These...
573	00:33:59	00:34:02	are the handles from the bag that he was found in.
574	00:34:02	00:34:04	You see these prints here?
575	00:34:09	00:34:10	Can I see your right hand, sir?
576	00:34:12	00:34:13	Look, he was drunk.
577	00:34:13	00:34:14	He was rolling all over my backseat.
578	00:34:15	00:34:17	So I put him in a bag from my trunk.
579	00:34:17	00:34:21	Once we got out of town, I just tipped him down the hill.
580	00:34:26	00:34:29	I figured he'd get out once he slept it off.
581	00:34:29	00:34:31	The guy always shows up.
582	00:34:33	00:34:34	What am I looking at?
583	00:34:36	00:34:37	Homicide.
584	00:34:39	00:34:42	Look, I was just doing my job.
585	00:34:42	00:34:43	Hey...
586	00:34:44	00:34:47	treating another human being like garbage is not a job.
587	00:34:47	00:34:50	It's a choice.
588	00:34:56	00:34:57	Paperwork. Later.
589	00:34:57	00:34:59	Dennis?
590	00:35:01	00:35:03	I need to talk to you.
591	00:35:04	00:35:08	You have to understand anything my sister did was to protect me.
592	00:35:09	00:35:12	You said that you went back to the high school that night after target practice.
593	00:35:12	00:35:15	I forgot a book I needed for homework.
594	00:35:16	00:35:18	And I knew Barry had been there.
595	00:35:21	00:35:22	I wasn't looking for him.
596	00:35:22	00:35:24	I had to go to the bathroom.
597	00:35:38	00:35:40	My dad's freaking out.
598	00:35:40	00:35:43	My sister won't come out of her room.
599	00:35:43	00:35:48	I figure if you can get the police to make some kind of deal for her...
600	00:35:49	00:35:54	Well, Dennis, you haven't told us that you explicitly saw Kelsey shoot the victim.
601	00:35:54	00:35:56	She was in a stall. I couldn't see her.
602	00:35:57	00:35:58	Can I, uh...
603	00:35:58	00:36:00	Can I talk to you for a minute?
604	00:36:00	00:36:01	Excuse us.
605	00:36:07	00:36:09	He copping to anything?
606	00:36:09	00:36:11	He says that his sister did it.
607	00:36:11	00:36:13	I don't think so.
608	00:36:13	00:36:17	Kelsey was otherwise disposed.
609	00:36:17	00:36:23	She got a parking ticket the same time the vic was shot in an alley behind a motel off Fremont Street.
610	00:36:23	00:36:27	In fact, a lot of cars got tickets that night.
611	00:36:30	00:36:32	Who's Jeremy Spencer?
612	00:36:32	00:36:34	Football coach.
613	00:36:34	00:36:35	Oh.
614	00:36:35	00:36:38	At a motel with the high school coach.
615	00:36:38	00:36:40	No wonder she wouldn't talk.
616	00:36:40	00:36:42	Well, I paid coach a visit.
617	00:36:42	00:36:43	The guy's 23, just got engaged.
618	00:36:43	00:36:46	I mean, he'll testify to anything as long as his fiancée doesn't find out.
619	00:36:46	00:36:54	He says that Kelsey gave him a roll in the hay asked him to intercede with Barry-the-bully and get the kid to leave her little brother alone.
620	00:36:54	00:36:57	She didn't kill anyone.
621	00:36:57	00:36:59	So why is he saying she did?
622	00:36:59	00:37:03	Do you ever smell a fart and end up blaming the wrong guy?
623	00:37:07	00:37:10	Why do you think your sister shot Barry?
624	00:37:10	00:37:12	Because.
625	00:37:12	00:37:14	Because why?
626	00:37:14	00:37:18	'Cause of the last time he beat me up.
627	00:37:23	00:37:25	I'll protect you.
628	00:37:25	00:37:29	I'll fix things so he never comes near you again.
629	00:37:29	00:37:31	She always keeps her word.
630	00:37:31	00:37:33	She asked Barry's coach to help you.
631	00:37:33	00:37:35	That was her protection plan.
632	00:37:35	00:37:37	She was nowhere near the high school that night.
633	00:37:37	00:37:39	I smelled her perfume.
634	00:37:39	00:37:41	I saw Barry.
635	00:37:41	00:37:42	I saw the gun.
636	00:37:42	00:37:44	And I smelled my sister's perfume.
637	00:37:46	00:37:48	No.
638	00:37:48	00:37:51	You smelled her brand of perfume.
639	00:37:51	00:37:53	But then who was it?
640	00:38:00	00:38:03	We recovered this from your townhouse on a warrant.
641	00:38:03	00:38:06	Chanteuse.
642	00:38:10	00:38:12	We also found the gun.
643	00:38:16	00:38:18	It hasn't been cleaned.
644	00:38:20	00:38:23	Well, I don't know how to clean a gun.
645	00:38:23	00:38:25	That was my husband's.
646	00:38:25	00:38:28	You know how to shoot one, though.
647	00:38:28	00:38:34	Do you know how many kids go to school and kill just to get relief from the bullying?
648	00:38:34	00:38:36	You talked to them.
649	00:38:36	00:38:38	Boxing lessons and target practice.
650	00:38:39	00:38:44	How long before one of them came in here and opened fire on a hallway full of kids, huh?
651	00:38:46	00:38:51	I just thought that one life was better than 20...
652	00:38:51	00:38:54	or 30.
653	00:38:55	00:38:57	Or eleven.
654	00:39:02	00:39:07	Captain Brass ran a search on you.
655	00:39:08	00:39:10	Tetrick High School, Tetrick, Arizona.
656	00:39:10	00:39:14	Eleven kids shot a few days after Columbine.
657	00:39:14	00:39:16	You were the Assistant Principal.
658	00:39:19	00:39:24	I watched them die at my feet.
659	00:39:26	00:39:32	Just because some sophomore couldn't take the jokes about his glasses.
660	00:39:34	00:39:39	It says that you were left with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
661	00:39:39	00:39:41	You might want to mention that to your lawyer.
662	00:39:43	00:39:46	I did this for my kids.
663	00:39:46	00:39:55	You know, Miss Barrett as difficult as high school can be for kids eventually, it's over...
664	00:39:57	00:40:00	...but too soon for Barry Schickel.
665	00:41:17	00:41:20	Rest in peace, Lieutenant.
666	00:41:20	00:42:26	Rest in peace.
