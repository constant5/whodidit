0	00:01:48	00:01:49	Vic's name's Christina Hollis.
1	00:01:49	00:01:51	She's a sales agent for the building.
2	00:01:51	00:01:55	Neighbor said she just came running out of her unit, delirious and hysterical.
3	00:01:55	00:01:56	Sexual assault?
4	00:01:57	00:01:58	Definitely.
5	00:01:58	00:02:01	I'm gonna go with her to the hospital, see if I can get a statement.
6	00:02:06	00:02:07	Video cameras.
7	00:02:07	00:02:09	That's good for us.
8	00:02:09	00:02:11	Vic probably thought it was good for her, too.
9	00:02:11	00:02:14	Excuse me, hi, can you identify yourself for the camera, please?
10	00:02:14	00:02:15	Just look right in the lens.
11	00:02:16	00:02:17	What is this? It's a reality crime show.
12	00:02:17	00:02:19	We're following you for this investigation.
13	00:02:19	00:02:21	Sheriff promised full cooperation.
14	00:02:21	00:02:23	We got that memo. They're Hard Crime.
15	00:02:23	00:02:28	That's us-- we're the guys who put the folks who look in the microscopes under the microscopes.
16	00:02:28	00:02:29	Right.
17	00:02:29	00:02:31	You see, it's good P.R. for the department.
18	00:02:31	00:02:33	Try not to bust their chops, okay?
19	00:02:33	00:02:35	You ever see the show? It's got a lot of forensics.
20	00:02:35	00:02:37	There's too many forensics shows on TV.
21	00:02:41	00:02:44	The door knob, the frame, the strike plate are all clean.
22	00:02:44	00:02:46	No sign of a forced entry.
23	00:02:46	00:02:48	So she might have known her assailant.
24	00:02:48	00:02:51	Either that or he talked his way in.
25	00:02:52	00:02:54	Hey, hey, hey.
26	00:02:54	00:02:56	Stay behind the crime tape.
27	00:02:56	00:02:57	Don't cut.
28	00:03:17	00:03:22	Mr. Grissom, can you please describe what you're seeing?
29	00:03:22	00:03:24	A long night.
30	00:03:59	00:04:03	I don't understand.
31	00:04:06	00:04:08	Why am I here?
32	00:04:08	00:04:13	Miss Hollis, you've been assaulted.
33	00:04:15	00:04:16	Who...?
34	00:04:16	00:04:18	I...
35	00:04:19	00:04:23	You don't know who did this?
36	00:04:23	00:04:25	What was the last thing you remember?
37	00:04:34	00:04:37	I don't know.
38	00:04:39	00:04:41	Oh, my God.
39	00:04:42	00:04:46	Oh, my God.
40	00:04:48	00:04:51	Okay, this isn't right.
41	00:04:51	00:04:53	Why isn't this right?
42	00:04:53	00:04:54	Why don't I look right?
43	00:04:54	00:04:55	Christina, it's okay.
44	00:04:55	00:04:56	No, it's not okay.
45	00:04:56	00:04:57	It's not okay.
46	00:04:57	00:05:01	Why don't I look right?
47	00:05:01	00:05:04	I don't underst...
48	00:05:04	00:05:05	Why are they st...
49	00:05:05	00:05:07	Why are they staring at me?
50	00:05:07	00:05:09	Stop looking at me!
51	00:05:09	00:05:11	Nurse, get in here! ( sobbing )
52	00:05:11	00:05:14	It's okay. It's okay.
53	00:05:15	00:05:19	I did a wet mount from a vaginal swab and got 4-plus motile sperm present.
54	00:05:19	00:05:22	So she was raped within the last few hours.
55	00:05:22	00:05:26	No condom means he's not in the system or he doesn't care if he gets caught.
56	00:05:26	00:05:27	Guys like this, they keep doing it.
57	00:05:27	00:05:28	Excuse me, Detective.
58	00:05:28	00:05:30	Can I ask you a question?
59	00:05:30	00:05:31	Detective.
60	00:05:31	00:05:33	You try something like that again and you're gone.
61	00:05:33	00:05:35	I don't a give a damn what the sheriff says.
62	00:05:36	00:05:38	We never put anyone on screen without a signed release.
63	00:05:38	00:05:40	You invaded her privacy at her most vulnerable moment.
64	00:05:40	00:05:42	I am trying to give the crime a face.
65	00:05:42	00:05:45	Yeah, well, we're going to lose an hour waiting for her to calm down.
66	00:05:45	00:05:46	That's on you.
67	00:05:46	00:05:48	I apologize. It won't happen again.
68	00:05:48	00:05:50	Look, can I just ask you what you've got there?
69	00:05:50	00:05:53	It's a sexual assault evidence kit and blood sample.
70	00:05:53	00:05:56	I've seen date rape victims in similar dissociative states.
71	00:05:56	00:05:59	We're going to run a tox screen, see if she was drugged.
72	00:05:59	00:06:00	You were a CSI, right?
73	00:06:00	00:06:01	Yeah.
74	00:06:01	00:06:03	And now you're a detective.
75	00:06:03	00:06:05	So which side of the fence do you prefer?
76	00:06:05	00:06:07	It's the same side.
77	00:06:50	00:06:52	Candles burned down.
78	00:06:52	00:06:53	A bouquet in the trash.
79	00:06:55	00:06:59	Flowers and candles-- sure seems like a date.
80	00:06:59	00:07:01	Some date.
81	00:07:11	00:07:14	There's a void in the wax.
82	00:07:31	00:07:34	Some kind of white flaky substance.
83	00:07:47	00:07:49	This looks like blood, but...
84	00:07:57	00:07:59	I think it's nail polish.
85	00:08:11	00:08:13	Hey, how's it going?
86	00:08:16	00:08:20	According to your supervisor, you were doing maintenance work on the 11th floor 00 a.m.
87	00:08:20	00:08:23	What were you fixing 00 in the morning?
88	00:08:23	00:08:26	I was just clocking a little overtime.
89	00:08:27	00:08:32	Management said they wanted a few extra coats of paint on three, seven and 11.
90	00:08:32	00:08:35	Got to keep everything nice and pretty for the tenants.
91	00:08:35	00:08:38	You know, the security guy didn't see you on his camera. Why is that?
92	00:08:38	00:08:41	Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much.
93	00:08:41	00:08:42	Service elevator's out.
94	00:08:42	00:08:44	We have to use the stairs.
95	00:08:44	00:08:47	God forbid the tenants ever have to look at one of us.
96	00:08:47	00:08:49	You got a master key to all the apartments?
97	00:08:49	00:08:50	Yeah.
98	00:08:51	00:08:55	But we only go in if a tenant specifically asks us to fix something.
99	00:08:55	00:08:57	You ever fix anything for Christina Hollis?
100	00:08:57	00:08:59	Nope. Never.
101	00:09:09	00:09:12	You're running a little low on duct tape, my man.
102	00:09:12	00:09:14	Yeah.
103	00:09:14	00:09:16	It's holding up half the building.
104	00:09:26	00:09:30	Two pieces of duct tape, both have been swabbed for DNA and fingerprinted.
105	00:09:31	00:09:32	Grissom wants you to compare adhesives.
106	00:09:32	00:09:34	He's looking for a match.
107	00:09:34	00:09:36	Okay.
108	00:09:36	00:09:37	That'll take a laser ablation test.
109	00:09:38	00:09:39	That's good.
110	00:09:39	00:09:40	Why's that good?
111	00:09:40	00:09:45	Well, laser ablation is both visual and dramatic.
112	00:09:45	00:09:48	Are you looking for the video crew right now?
113	00:09:48	00:09:51	I would think that they would be looking for me.
114	00:09:51	00:09:54	Relax, man, the show's only an hour long.
115	00:09:54	00:09:57	Laser ablation takes, like, six.
116	00:09:57	00:10:00	Yeah, but when they cut it together, it'll only take 30 seconds.
117	00:10:41	00:10:44	Ran laser ablation on the duct tape samples.
118	00:10:44	00:10:45	Not a match.
119	00:10:45	00:10:48	So she wasn't tied up with the maintenance man's tape.
120	00:10:48	00:10:50	Mm-mm. What about the rest of the trace?
121	00:10:50	00:10:54	White powder was primarily biological, so I kicked it back to DNA.
122	00:10:54	00:10:56	It did contain some glassy particles.
123	00:10:56	00:10:58	Might be industrial diamonds.
124	00:10:58	00:10:59	And the yellow reflective flakes?
125	00:10:59	00:11:02	My next priority.
126	00:11:02	00:11:05	( scoffs ) That's a waste of film.
127	00:11:05	00:11:09	The victim came out of her apartment around 5 so I've been working my way back from then.
128	00:11:09	00:11:16	In the previous seven hours, 37 people came and went from the 11th floor, 21 of them male.
129	00:11:16	00:11:19	So the assailant could be any one of them...
130	00:11:19	00:11:22	assuming that our guy didn't take the stairs which, of course, aren't monitored.
131	00:11:25	00:11:28	32 p.m.
132	00:11:28	00:11:30	There's no footage of him coming back down.
133	00:11:30	00:11:32	And check this out.
134	00:11:38	00:11:39	He brought flowers.
135	00:11:39	00:11:41	How romantic.
136	00:11:41	00:11:44	But I don't think this was a first date.
137	00:11:54	00:11:56	Guy had his own key.
138	00:11:56	00:11:59	So he could've been with the victim the whole night.
139	00:11:59	00:12:03	Pull the best image of his face you can, and get a printout to Brass.
140	00:12:03	00:12:04	I'm on it.
141	00:12:04	00:12:06	Ms. Willows, hold on a second.
142	00:12:06	00:12:08	All you have is a guy's face.
143	00:12:08	00:12:11	How do you figure out who he is?
144	00:12:11	00:12:13	Good question.
145	00:12:18	00:12:20	Guys, we're good to go.
146	00:12:24	00:12:26	So what have you found so far?
147	00:12:26	00:12:29	I lifted two identifiable prints off the bouquet wrapper.
148	00:12:30	00:12:32	How do you know they belong to the suspect?
149	00:12:32	00:12:42	We don't, but one matched a print found on the duct tape, right here, used to tape up the victim.
150	00:12:42	00:12:45	Unfortunately, that print's not in our database.
151	00:12:45	00:12:48	So your suspect doesn't have a record?
152	00:12:49	00:12:50	Apparently not, no.
153	00:12:50	00:12:53	Well, how do you find a guy who's not in the system?
154	00:12:53	00:12:57	( chuckles ) You just got to get creative, you know?
155	00:12:57	00:13:04	I mean, the flowers... came from a small shop off-strip.
156	00:13:04	00:13:08	Took the suspect's image to the clerk, showed it to him.
157	00:13:08	00:13:09	He gave me a credit card receipt.
158	00:13:10	00:13:12	From that receipt, I got a name.
159	00:13:12	00:13:15	That name gave me a driver's license.
160	00:13:15	00:13:17	Dwight Reynolds.
161	00:13:17	00:13:19	Police are bringing him in now.
162	00:13:19	00:13:21	Great, okay.
163	00:13:21	00:13:23	Clear and concise, thank you. Thanks.
164	00:13:23	00:13:25	Yeah, well, we have to do it in court all the time.
165	00:13:25	00:13:31	If you can't explain it to a jury, then the bad guy usually walks, and we don't like it when the bad guy walks.
166	00:13:31	00:13:33	Unit picked him up at the Double Down.
167	00:13:33	00:13:34	He was plastered.
168	00:13:34	00:13:36	What'd he blow?
169	00:13:36	00:13:38	One nine.
170	00:13:38	00:13:40	That's almost enough to wash away your sins.
171	00:13:40	00:13:42	Well, we're going to have wait until he sobers up.
172	00:13:42	00:13:44	No, no, let's not wait, let's move on this.
173	00:13:44	00:13:46	I think we got a chance.
174	00:13:46	00:13:49	Look, why don't you come in there with me, huh?
175	00:13:49	00:13:51	Maybe pop a few buttons?
176	00:13:51	00:13:53	( chuckles ) No, seriously.
177	00:13:53	00:13:55	See how he reacts.
178	00:13:55	00:13:59	If he tries too hard not to look, it could be a guilty conscience?
179	00:13:59	00:14:01	Yeah, maybe, something like that.
180	00:14:01	00:14:06	If he is the guy, and we interview him now, anything he says could be thrown out of court.
181	00:14:06	00:14:08	It's worth a try.
182	00:14:08	00:14:13	What do you think, huh?
183	00:14:13	00:14:16	Let's go.
184	00:14:22	00:14:25	How's it going?
185	00:14:25	00:14:26	Okay.
186	00:14:26	00:14:28	Did you know a Christina Hollis?
187	00:14:28	00:14:31	Yeah, we used to date.
188	00:14:31	00:14:33	You seen her recently?
189	00:14:33	00:14:37	No. Then how come we found your prints on some flowers at her place?
190	00:14:37	00:14:41	I dropped some flowers off... but I didn't see her when I did.
191	00:14:41	00:14:42	You had a key?
192	00:14:42	00:14:44	Yeah.
193	00:14:44	00:14:46	She likes me to come over sometimes, you know?
194	00:14:47	00:14:48	Help her move stuff.
195	00:14:58	00:15:00	Oh, come on, what really happened, huh?
196	00:15:00	00:15:05	You went over to move some stuff, and she wasn't in the mood, is that it?
197	00:15:05	00:15:08	I told you-- I didn't see her.
198	00:15:22	00:15:26	She was playing Barry White.
199	00:15:26	00:15:27	Everybody knows what that means.
200	00:15:29	00:15:32	I guess it wasn't my night. You're lying!
201	00:15:34	00:15:37	We found the flowers inside her apartment, in the trash, and you didn't use the elevator to leave.
202	00:15:37	00:15:39	I was pissed.
203	00:15:40	00:15:41	I tried to walk it off.
204	00:15:41	00:15:45	I figured 11 flights down, it's better than a cold shower.
205	00:15:45	00:15:50	Christina Hollis was tied up and brutally assaulted in her apartment last night.
206	00:15:50	00:15:51	What?
207	00:15:51	00:15:52	And you were there.
208	00:15:53	00:15:54	Is she...?
209	00:15:55	00:15:56	She's alive and talking.
210	00:15:56	00:15:58	Last night?
211	00:15:58	00:16:01	The guy who with her was...
212	00:16:01	00:16:03	was doing that to her?
213	00:16:08	00:16:10	I could've stopped it.
214	00:16:14	00:16:18	So the powder that you found on the bedroom floor was actually keratinized skin cells.
215	00:16:18	00:16:21	They belong to the vic, and morphology suggests that they're probably from her cuticles.
216	00:16:22	00:16:23	Cuticles? Mm-hmm.
217	00:16:23	00:16:24	Nail polish, diamond particles...
218	00:16:24	00:16:28	Maybe she was giving herself a mani and pedi before the assault.
219	00:16:29	00:16:34	I don't know about you, but if I could afford to live in an apartment like that, I'd be in a spa every week.
220	00:16:34	00:16:35	Yeah, I hear you there. Thank you.
221	00:16:35	00:16:36	Mm-hmm.
222	00:16:38	00:16:41	Wendy ran the semen, no hits in CODIS.
223	00:16:42	00:16:46	Yeah, the, uh... ex-boyfriend didn't match any of the prints on the duct tape, either.
224	00:16:46	00:16:50	SAE found oral, vaginal and anal smears positive for semen.
225	00:16:50	00:16:54	Degraded and intact sperm suggests multiple deposits.
226	00:16:54	00:16:58	Which means that he probably raped her on and off, for a long time.
227	00:16:58	00:17:03	Yeah, well, tox came back-- lorazepam in the vic's blood.
228	00:17:03	00:17:05	I didn't find any prescription bottles in her apartment.
229	00:17:05	00:17:06	No, nor did I.
230	00:17:06	00:17:11	Lorazepam is a hypnotic sedative, and I know in high doses, it causes acute amnesia.
231	00:17:11	00:17:14	Maybe that's what he was counting on to cover his tracks.
232	00:17:14	00:17:17	Well, it usually takes an hour for a drug like that to kick in.
233	00:17:17	00:17:20	How did he subdue her in the meantime?
234	00:17:20	00:17:25	Low-profile entry, sedatives, duct tape-- I mean, if he's not a serial, he will be soon.
235	00:17:36	00:17:37	Hey, there, gorgeous.
236	00:17:38	00:17:41	I'm going to be running with the trace from the victim's apartment.
237	00:17:41	00:17:43	Would you mind bringing me up to speed?
238	00:17:43	00:17:44	Certainly.
239	00:17:44	00:17:46	Take your time.
240	00:17:48	00:17:49	Did you page us?
241	00:17:49	00:17:52	Um... No. Mm-mm.
242	00:17:53	00:18:00	According to the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, the glossy red drop you found on the footboard was...
243	00:18:00	00:18:02	nail polish.
244	00:18:02	00:18:05	Well, that's not unusual in a woman's apartment.
245	00:18:05	00:18:09	What is far more intriguing is the reflective yellow flakes.
246	00:18:09	00:18:13	Follow me to the Fourier Transform Infrared Microscope.
247	00:18:13	00:18:14	Hodges, what's wrong with you?
248	00:18:14	00:18:15	Nothing.
249	00:18:15	00:18:18	Guys... stay with the girl.
250	00:18:21	00:18:30	As you can see, the flakes are fluorescent reflective lenses bonded to an aramid backing by a special polymer layer.
251	00:18:30	00:18:35	And it's used exclusively in the reflective trim of firemen's turnouts.
252	00:18:37	00:18:41	You're telling me there was a firefighter in the victim's bedroom.
253	00:18:43	00:18:45	Hmm...
254	00:18:45	00:18:47	Thanks. Thanks, Hodges.
255	00:18:47	00:18:49	Anytime.
256	00:18:56	00:18:59	Yeah, all right, okay, let 'em roll.
257	00:18:59	00:19:00	But you're buying the lobster.
258	00:19:00	00:19:01	Yeah, right.
259	00:19:01	00:19:06	See, one of the guys gets on TV, that guy has to buy lobster for the whole company, you know?
260	00:19:07	00:19:10	These guys eat well-- lobster thermidor!
261	00:19:10	00:19:11	Check it out.
262	00:19:11	00:19:17	So, according to dispatch, you responded to an alarm at the Omni condos last night?
263	00:19:17	00:19:18	58 p.m.
264	00:19:18	00:19:20	We were on scene in about four minutes.
265	00:19:21	00:19:24	Three smoke bombs on three different floors, three pains in my ass.
266	00:19:24	00:19:26	There's no major damage, just paint and wallpaper.
267	00:19:26	00:19:27	We were there about a half hour.
268	00:19:27	00:19:29	What'd the arson guys find?
269	00:19:29	00:19:31	They didn't find much.
270	00:19:31	00:19:34	The smoke bombs were made out of soda cans.
271	00:19:34	00:19:36	Kids, Internet, you do the math.
272	00:19:36	00:19:37	It's all in your lab.
273	00:19:37	00:19:39	Really? What for?
274	00:19:39	00:19:43	A couple guys from the day shift were gonna compare 'em to those bombs we found a couple of weeks ago.
275	00:19:43	00:19:45	What are you talking about?
276	00:19:45	00:19:46	Apartment building over on Paradise.
277	00:19:47	00:19:49	Smoke bombs started a fire, one woman died.
278	00:19:49	00:19:50	We still don't have a suspect in that.
279	00:19:50	00:19:53	Were you on the scene?
280	00:19:53	00:19:55	I saw it after.
281	00:19:55	00:19:58	Smoke bomb was too close to the wall, the whole place...
282	00:20:04	00:20:07	Which of your guys were up on the 11th floor at the Omni?
283	00:20:07	00:20:09	I don't know. I'd have to ask around. Why?
284	00:20:09	00:20:11	A woman was raped last night.
285	00:20:13	00:20:15	You think one of my guys did it?
286	00:20:15	00:20:19	I'm not saying that, but we found some evidence that a fireman was near her bed.
287	00:20:19	00:20:22	You came here to accuse my guys of this in front of the camera?
288	00:20:22	00:20:24	No, no, no. Settle down, settle down...
289	00:20:24	00:20:25	The hell I will.
290	00:20:28	00:20:30	No wonder they call you Brass, because you really got a set.
291	00:20:30	00:20:31	Aw, come on, Sparky...
292	00:20:32	00:20:33	Excuse me, gentlemen.
293	00:20:33	00:20:35	Captain, uh, which of your guys...
294	00:20:35	00:20:37	wears a yellow reflective stripe on their turnouts?
295	00:20:37	00:20:40	Nobody; department's color is orange.
296	00:20:42	00:20:47	The reflective flake we found in Christina Hollis' apartment was yellow.
297	00:20:47	00:20:50	Then you're not looking for a Las Vegas fireman.
298	00:20:50	00:20:54	According to surveillance, 19 p.m.
299	00:20:54	00:20:59	And the firemen were in her building 00.
300	00:20:59	00:21:03	They took the stairs, so we don't have them on this camera.
301	00:21:03	00:21:05	Now take a look at this...
302	00:21:08	00:21:11	Well, he certainly looks the part.
303	00:21:11	00:21:14	He touched the door with his bare hands.
304	00:21:14	00:21:16	Might get prints.
305	00:21:18	00:21:21	36 p.m.
306	00:21:21	00:21:23	58.
307	00:21:23	00:21:26	That's 22 minutes later.
308	00:21:26	00:21:28	What kind of fireman comes before the fire?
309	00:21:28	00:21:31	Someone who knows it's coming.
310	00:21:32	00:21:34	Uh, Mr. Grissom, we may have missed that.
311	00:21:35	00:21:37	Could you say it one more time for camera?
312	00:21:43	00:21:46	You ever hear the saying, Only the dumb ones get caught?
313	00:21:46	00:21:47	Yeah...
314	00:21:47	00:21:50	but we catch the smart ones, too.
315	00:21:50	00:21:52	And this guy's definitely smart.
316	00:21:54	00:21:59	He lights smoke bombs on three different floors so as not to call attention to his target.
317	00:21:59	00:22:05	Victim sees the smoke, sees him, and opens the door.
318	00:22:11	00:22:13	( knocking ) ! Fire department, open up.
319	00:22:13	00:22:16	I mean, who wouldn't trust a fireman, right?
320	00:22:21	00:22:25	It takes a lot of courage to do this.
321	00:22:25	00:22:27	Thank you.
322	00:22:27	00:22:34	And if you change your mind about the camera, all you have to do is say so-- no one ever has to see this.
323	00:22:34	00:22:37	No, I want him to see it.
324	00:22:37	00:22:40	He'll watch it in jail.
325	00:22:40	00:22:46	Okay, so, you said you were beginning to remember what happened?
326	00:22:46	00:22:48	Yeah, a little.
327	00:22:49	00:22:51	Can you tell me what he looked like?
328	00:22:55	00:22:57	Um...
329	00:22:58	00:23:01	No, not really.
330	00:23:01	00:23:06	It's mostly, uh... just feelings.
331	00:23:06	00:23:08	Feelings.
332	00:23:08	00:23:09	Of what?
333	00:23:12	00:23:14	I know he raped me.
334	00:23:20	00:23:24	What I remember most...
335	00:23:24	00:23:26	it was, um...
336	00:23:42	00:23:45	He...
337	00:23:45	00:23:47	He kept...
338	00:23:47	00:23:49	He kept touching my feet.
339	00:23:54	00:23:57	He kept touching my feet.
340	00:24:06	00:24:09	A foot fetish is a visual pathology.
341	00:24:09	00:24:14	The suspect would have had to be close enough to the vic to see her toes and then get aroused.
342	00:24:14	00:24:16	We live in a desert, Gil.
343	00:24:16	00:24:19	You want to see a woman's bare feet, all you have to do is look down.
344	00:24:29	00:24:34	Door in the parking structure smudge city.
345	00:24:34	00:24:36	Anything useful from the janitor?
346	00:24:36	00:24:37	Yeah, he gave us a full description.
347	00:24:37	00:24:39	Said he looked like a fireman.
348	00:24:40	00:24:47	Well, between eBay, uniform shops, and national manufacturers, there's about a hundred different places that you can buy yellow-striped turnouts.
349	00:24:47	00:24:50	Maybe he was a fireman in another city.
350	00:24:50	00:24:52	Maybe.
351	00:24:53	00:24:54	What's that?
352	00:24:54	00:25:01	When I was at the firehouse, all of the air tanks were rigged with the valves on the bottom, like this one.
353	00:25:01	00:25:03	But our guy...
354	00:25:04	00:25:05	his valve is on top.
355	00:25:06	00:25:08	A real fireman probably wouldn't make that mistake.
356	00:25:08	00:25:11	His air line isn't even rigged to his mask.
357	00:25:11	00:25:13	It's rigged to a second mask on his side.
358	00:25:15	00:25:17	Maybe he put something in the tank to subdue her.
359	00:25:17	00:25:20	He used lorazepam.
360	00:25:20	00:25:21	Eventually.
361	00:25:21	00:25:25	But this guy was somehow able to get her from the door to the bed without a struggle.
362	00:25:28	00:25:29	I bet he used nitrous oxide.
363	00:25:31	00:25:32	That stuff will knock you out real fast.
364	00:25:38	00:25:41	And it's undetectable in the blood after a few minutes.
365	00:25:41	00:25:42	Pretty easy to come by.
366	00:25:42	00:25:46	And it would explain the valve on top.
367	00:25:46	00:25:48	It's liquid under pressure.
368	00:25:48	00:25:50	It would spill if it were upside down.
369	00:25:50	00:25:53	All you need is a driver's license and a deposit for the tank.
370	00:25:53	00:25:59	If this guy bought nitrous from a local distributor, there's definitely a record.
371	00:25:59	00:26:00	Check it out.
372	00:26:00	00:26:02	Come on, Tina.
373	00:26:02	00:26:04	Like, I'm the only one working doubles here.
374	00:26:07	00:26:11	Oh, so it's my fault that we have strange schedules.
375	00:26:13	00:26:15	Great. Go out with your friends.
376	00:26:15	00:26:18	I'm sure you'll be seeing Robert again tonight, too, huh?
377	00:26:19	00:26:21	You know what?
378	00:26:21	00:26:22	It's fine.
379	00:26:22	00:26:24	I got to go.
380	00:26:24	00:26:26	Have a fun time.
381	00:26:26	00:26:28	This a bad time?
382	00:26:28	00:26:32	No. Great time. What can I do for you?
383	00:26:32	00:26:34	What are you working on?
384	00:26:34	00:26:38	I'm examining smoke bombs recovered from, uh...
385	00:26:39	00:26:45	the victim'scondo, and comparing them to smoke bombs from an arson case a couple of weeks ago.
386	00:26:45	00:26:47	How do you know which is which?
387	00:26:47	00:26:49	I mean, how do you tell them apart?
388	00:26:49	00:26:54	Well, so far, I've only opened up one item from each case.
389	00:26:54	00:27:02	CSIs, when we work a case, we take extensive notes at the scene, and photos of each item.
390	00:27:02	00:27:08	And, uh... they're very similar, I know.
391	00:27:08	00:27:17	But, based on the construction and the components, I'd say these two bombs were made by the same person.
392	00:27:24	00:27:27	So I guess this is a slow day at the morgue.
393	00:27:27	00:27:29	You can't really predict this job.
394	00:27:29	00:27:32	Today it's like this, tomorrow it's a bus accident.
395	00:27:32	00:27:34	So I am here.
396	00:27:34	00:27:36	Albert. Yeah?
397	00:27:36	00:27:38	Did you find the blood sample I called you about?
398	00:27:38	00:27:41	Female arson fatality. C.O.D. is smoke inhalation.
399	00:27:41	00:27:45	Partial tox came back carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide.
400	00:27:45	00:27:48	I need a test for lorazepam.
401	00:27:48	00:27:50	Blood's on its way to Tox.
402	00:27:50	00:27:55	You recall any other sexual assault victims that tested positive for lorazepam?
403	00:27:55	00:27:59	Uh... Nothing comes to mind, but I'll check my files, confer with Toxicology.
404	00:27:59	00:28:00	Thanks.
405	00:28:00	00:28:02	Yeah.
406	00:28:02	00:28:05	A slow day is a good day.
407	00:28:05	00:28:10	These people lived on the same floor as the female arson fatality from two weeks ago.
408	00:28:10	00:28:13	Tox on the arson victim came back negative for lorazepam.
409	00:28:14	00:28:16	So maybe she wasn't the target.
410	00:28:16	00:28:18	Ms. Sidle, is this what you guys call a fishing expedition?
411	00:28:19	00:28:20	We call this following a lead.
412	00:28:20	00:28:23	Forgive me, but it's not very much of a lead.
413	00:28:23	00:28:25	What's that supposed to mean?
414	00:28:25	00:28:27	Well, this case is even colder than the one you'reon.
415	00:28:27	00:28:31	You'd almost be better off if you had a new rape victim and a fresh scene.
416	00:28:31	00:28:37	That might be true, but that is definitely not the outcome that we're looking for.
417	00:28:46	00:28:48	I didn't really know the girl who died.
418	00:28:48	00:28:50	I still can't believe what happened.
419	00:28:50	00:28:52	It's just awful.
420	00:28:52	00:28:53	Tell me what you remember.
421	00:28:55	00:28:57	I was alone in my apartment Saturday night.
422	00:28:57	00:29:00	Hello. What's new, right?
423	00:29:00	00:29:01	I was reading or something.
424	00:29:01	00:29:05	And then, suddenly, there was someone pounding on my door.
425	00:29:13	00:29:15	Can you describe what he looked like?
426	00:29:15	00:29:17	Well, he was fireman.
427	00:29:17	00:29:19	I mean, he was wearing a mask.
428	00:29:19	00:29:22	It all happened pretty quick.
429	00:29:22	00:29:25	Why?
430	00:29:25	00:29:29	We're looking for a rapist who masquerades as a fireman.
431	00:29:30	00:29:35	He uses smoke bombs to get his victims to open their doors.
432	00:29:36	00:29:38	He knocked on my door.
433	00:29:38	00:29:42	Are you saying you think he was going to rape me?
434	00:29:42	00:29:43	It's possible.
435	00:29:43	00:29:48	You know, I was pretty freaked.
436	00:29:49	00:29:52	When he was standing there in front of me...
437	00:29:56	00:30:04	Just before he left, I swear, for a second, it felt like he wasn't going to let me go.
438	00:30:09	00:30:11	Turnouts were a dead end.
439	00:30:11	00:30:14	And there's nothing to track off of the smoke bombs.
440	00:30:14	00:30:18	I've got hundreds of names of people who purchased nitrous oxide in the last six months.
441	00:30:18	00:30:20	What? You got to narrow that down.
442	00:30:20	00:30:22	That is narrowed down.
443	00:30:24	00:30:26	Okay. Our rapist is a foot fetishist.
444	00:30:26	00:30:27	That's what gets him off.
445	00:30:27	00:30:30	He has to see his victim's feet somewhere.
446	00:30:30	00:30:34	If we can figure out where, maybe we can find him.
447	00:30:34	00:30:36	What do the victims have in common?
448	00:30:38	00:30:40	Christina Hollis.
449	00:30:40	00:30:42	African American. Single.
450	00:30:42	00:30:44	Lives and works at the Omni.
451	00:30:44	00:30:49	She lives on the 11th floor, so there's no real way for a peeper to see in.
452	00:30:49	00:30:53	And she uses the gym, but not the pool.
453	00:30:53	00:30:57	Stephanie Daniels lives across town. Caucasian. Also single.
454	00:30:57	00:31:01	No gym membership, but she does use the pool at her apartment complex regularly.
455	00:31:01	00:31:04	There's a couple of adjacent buildings.
456	00:31:04	00:31:08	It's possible that somebody could see into her place with a telescope, but she has shades and curtains.
457	00:31:09	00:31:11	I kind of doubt it.
458	00:31:11	00:31:13	So they have nothing in common.
459	00:31:13	00:31:16	Sure, they do. They both have feet.
460	00:31:16	00:31:21	We may have a third victim who may also be our first victim.
461	00:31:21	00:31:28	Tara Weathers. Last month, she claimed she was drugged in a bar and woke up in her apartment with her toes freshly painted.
462	00:31:28	00:31:31	They did a tox on her at the time.
463	00:31:31	00:31:33	Found lorazepam in her system.
464	00:31:36	00:31:38	Well, she does have nice feet.
465	00:31:39	00:31:43	And the nail polish looks like a similar shade to Christina Hollis'.
466	00:31:43	00:31:45	Yeah. So the pattern starts a month ago.
467	00:31:45	00:31:51	Our guy drugs Tara Weathers in a bar, takes her to her apartment, paints her toes, leaves.
468	00:31:51	00:31:54	Two weeks later, he steps it up.
469	00:31:54	00:32:00	Poses as a firefighter, places smoke bombs in an apartment building, only things don't work out the way that he planned.
470	00:32:00	00:32:03	The building catches fire, and he runs.
471	00:32:03	00:32:08	He waits a couple more weeks, he does it again, but this time he goes all the way.
472	00:32:08	00:32:09	Yeah. And now he's escalating.
473	00:32:09	00:32:12	Where does he go from here?
474	00:32:17	00:32:18	Tara Weathers?
475	00:32:18	00:32:20	I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
476	00:32:20	00:32:22	This is Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
477	00:32:22	00:32:23	What do you want?
478	00:32:23	00:32:27	Well, we're here to ask you about the incident you reported to the police last month.
479	00:32:27	00:32:28	The nail polish thing?
480	00:32:28	00:32:29	Yeah, the nail polish thing.
481	00:32:29	00:32:33	You guys said I should consider myself lucky, that there was no real crime anyway.
482	00:32:33	00:32:35	Well, we may have been wrong about that.
483	00:32:35	00:32:38	I knew it, that's what I tried to tell you the first time.
484	00:32:41	00:32:47	The guy who drugged you is a rapist and a murderer, and we're looking to stop him before he does it again.
485	00:32:47	00:32:48	Are you serious?
486	00:32:48	00:32:49	Very.
487	00:32:49	00:32:53	We're trying to understand what you have in common with the other victims that might lead us to him.
488	00:32:53	00:32:55	Now he has a foot fetish.
489	00:32:55	00:32:56	He's into feet.
490	00:32:56	00:33:00	Is there any way that he could've... seen your feet?
491	00:33:00	00:33:01	Um...
492	00:33:01	00:33:04	I-I... I don't know.
493	00:33:04	00:33:05	Where do you buy your shoes?
494	00:33:05	00:33:07	All over.
495	00:33:07	00:33:09	Do you go to a gym? No, not really.
496	00:33:09	00:33:10	Pool?
497	00:33:10	00:33:12	No, never. I burn easily.
498	00:33:12	00:33:14	I'm a legal secretary, I don't get out much.
499	00:33:14	00:33:18	My work starts early and it goes late.
500	00:33:18	00:33:21	The firm is so conservative, we're not even allowed to wear open-toed shoes.
501	00:33:21	00:33:23	I notice that you do yoga.
502	00:33:23	00:33:24	Yeah.
503	00:33:25	00:33:26	Where?
504	00:33:26	00:33:27	Out on the balcony.
505	00:33:27	00:33:29	It's practically the only fresh air I get.
506	00:33:43	00:33:47	Anybody in those apartments has a clear view of her bare feet.
507	00:33:47	00:33:50	So how'd you get the warrant?
508	00:33:50	00:33:53	The tenant's name was on the nitrous oxide list.
509	00:33:54	00:33:55	Las Vegas Police.
510	00:33:55	00:33:57	Open up, we have a warrant.
511	00:33:57	00:33:59	Open up, police.
512	00:33:59	00:34:01	Open it.
513	00:34:03	00:34:05	Let's go.
514	00:34:05	00:34:07	No, no, no, you're not going in there, no.
515	00:34:07	00:34:09	Can you please take this in, it's a flashlight cam.
516	00:34:09	00:34:11	It'll record anything you point it at.
517	00:34:13	00:34:14	All clear.
518	00:34:15	00:34:16	Thanks.
519	00:34:32	00:34:34	Perfect view of Tara's balcony.
520	00:34:43	00:34:47	Yoga flyers from all over town.
521	00:34:51	00:34:54	Guy's got everything he needs for a pedicure.
522	00:35:08	00:35:11	Hey, check this out.
523	00:35:12	00:35:15	God bless the internet.
524	00:36:00	00:36:03	Fireman's air tank case.
525	00:36:07	00:36:09	Where's the tank?
526	00:36:18	00:36:20	Yeah, this is Brass.
527	00:36:20	00:36:22	I want to put a broadcast out on Richard McQueen.
528	00:36:22	00:36:25	That's M-C-Q-U-E-E-N.
529	00:36:25	00:36:27	Copy. ( cell phone blips )
530	00:36:27	00:36:28	Candle wax on the camera.
531	00:37:02	00:37:04	There, send it to the monitor.
532	00:37:22	00:37:24	Stay down!
533	00:37:24	00:37:26	Las Vegas P.D.!
534	00:37:26	00:37:28	Las Vegas P.D., break it up!
535	00:37:28	00:37:29	Break it up!
536	00:37:29	00:37:31	What the hell's going on here? Smoke bombs.
537	00:37:31	00:37:32	We caught this creep sneaking away.
538	00:37:32	00:37:35	My guys tried to stop him.
539	00:37:35	00:37:37	She wouldn't let me touch her feet.
540	00:37:37	00:37:39	You should see what he did?
541	00:38:15	00:38:19	Women are four times more likely than men to be the victims of a sex-related murder.
542	00:38:19	00:38:23	And men are ten times more likely than women to be the murderer.
543	00:38:23	00:38:25	It's just the way it is.
544	00:38:44	00:38:46	Is that your daughter?
545	00:38:46	00:38:49	Oh, yeah, these are old pictures.
546	00:38:49	00:38:51	She's a teenager now.
547	00:38:51	00:38:54	With all the things you see on this job, do you ever worry about her?
548	00:38:54	00:38:56	Are you kidding?
549	00:38:56	00:38:58	I keep a vial of her blood in my freezer.
550	00:38:58	00:39:04	Like as a DNA sample in case you need to identify her?
551	00:39:04	00:39:07	Well...
552	00:39:07	00:39:14	One thing you learn doing this job is that bad things happen to people who never expect it...
553	00:39:14	00:39:16	every day.
554	00:39:26	00:39:28	Yeah, we got a confession.
555	00:39:28	00:39:31	He didn't choose women's feet, women's feet chose him.
556	00:39:31	00:39:35	He lit candles, he played music, he thought he was on a date.
557	00:39:35	00:39:37	But did he explain, you know, why he did it?
558	00:39:37	00:39:39	Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.
559	00:39:39	00:39:46	His mother was a hooker, she put him under the bed when she did her business, her feet dangled over the edge of the bed.
560	00:39:46	00:39:48	He watched her feet, they were perfect.
561	00:39:48	00:39:50	You know, I don't know if it's true.
562	00:39:50	00:39:53	What about the fireman thing?
563	00:39:53	00:39:56	I don't know, I guess he wanted to be a fireman when he grew up.
564	00:39:56	00:39:59	Didn't you?
565	00:39:59	00:40:01	Look, juries love explanations, they want it nice and neat.
566	00:40:01	00:40:06	They don't want to know we live in a random world, they want meaning.
567	00:40:06	00:40:08	It's that simple.
568	00:40:08	00:40:10	So how do you cope with a day like today?
569	00:40:10	00:40:12	What do you do?
570	00:40:12	00:40:21	What do you want me to tell you, that I go home, I get drunk, I go to a bar, I stay out all night, I don't sleep... huh?
571	00:40:21	00:40:22	That's not the truth. You know what happens?
572	00:40:23	00:40:25	I take care of myself, I sleep very well.
573	00:40:25	00:40:30	How well did you sleep after you learned you killed that fellow officer in that shootout last year?
574	00:40:36	00:40:38	Uh, yeah.
575	00:40:38	00:40:39	Oh, is this... is that...
576	00:40:39	00:40:40	Oh, is this what this is about?
577	00:40:40	00:40:42	Who've you been talking to, huh?
578	00:40:42	00:40:45	What, you come here with your camera and you roll a little film and...
579	00:40:45	00:40:48	what, you think you know what it's like to be a cop?
580	00:40:48	00:40:50	You?
581	00:40:51	00:40:53	You're all done. You're all done with this.
582	00:40:53	00:40:55	Get out of here.
583	00:40:58	00:41:02	The truth is if there isn't any evidence, we have nowhere to go.
584	00:41:02	00:41:04	So you feel you did the best you could?
585	00:41:04	00:41:05	Yes, I do.
586	00:41:06	00:41:10	Do you think forensic shows are just teaching the criminals how to get away with crimes?
587	00:41:10	00:41:13	Everyone learns from science.
588	00:41:13	00:41:16	It all depends on how you use the knowledge.
589	00:41:21	00:41:23	Keep going, go inside for a close-up.
