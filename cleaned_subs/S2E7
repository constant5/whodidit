0	00:00:20	00:00:22	Come on, come on, come on, come on.
1	00:00:22	00:00:23	Come on, come on!
2	00:00:50	00:00:53	Paramedics pronounced 20 minutes ago.
3	00:00:53	00:00:54	Megan Treadwell.
4	00:00:54	00:00:56	I ran her plates.
5	00:00:56	00:00:59	33 tomorrow.
6	00:00:59	00:01:02	One-on-one with a train.
7	00:01:02	00:01:05	Did she think that she could beat it?
8	00:01:10	00:01:11	Hey.
9	00:01:13	00:01:15	Door handle.
10	00:01:15	00:01:18	passenger-side door.
11	00:01:18	00:01:20	Dead center.
12	00:01:20	00:01:25	Why did the SUV cross the tracks?
13	00:01:25	00:01:26	To get to the other side.
14	00:02:12	00:02:14	Sheriff says we're holding up trains all over the country.
15	00:02:15	00:02:18	This entire railroad division depends on keeping the main line open.
16	00:02:18	00:02:20	Well, it's not like we can take this back to the garage.
17	00:02:20	00:02:24	Well, unfortunately, his priority is clearing this train from the tracks.
18	00:02:24	00:02:26	You have two hours.
19	00:02:27	00:02:29	Where are you going?
20	00:02:29	00:02:30	Suspicious circs in town.
21	00:02:30	00:02:31	This one's all yours.
22	00:02:31	00:02:34	Thanks but you got to give me some guys.
23	00:02:34	00:02:36	Sara's all you get.
24	00:02:36	00:02:38	All I need.
25	00:02:44	00:02:47	Burglary in Progress call.
26	00:02:48	00:02:51	Once we made entry, we found the victim downstairs.
27	00:02:53	00:02:55	Never knew this place existed.
28	00:02:55	00:02:57	The Western States Historical Society.
29	00:02:57	00:03:00	It's not on a lot of tourist maps.
30	00:03:02	00:03:03	I had them cut the wires.
31	00:03:04	00:03:06	We need to identify the source of the alarm, Ray.
32	00:03:06	00:03:08	Security company said it was downstairs.
33	00:03:08	00:03:11	The body's there, too.
34	00:03:15	00:03:18	Trying to get them to turn some more lights on in here.
35	00:03:18	00:03:21	There are no more lights, O'Riley.
36	00:03:21	00:03:22	It's a controlled environment.
37	00:03:22	00:03:24	Notice how you're not sweating?
38	00:03:24	00:03:26	It's probably 66 degrees in here.
39	00:03:26	00:03:27	35% relative humidity.
40	00:03:28	00:03:31	Too much light, too much heat degrades the books.
41	00:03:31	00:03:33	What-- nobody's got a key?
42	00:03:33	00:03:36	The curator's across town.
43	00:03:36	00:03:37	He's on his way.
44	00:03:37	00:03:39	She looks dead to me.
45	00:03:48	00:03:49	You got first touch.
46	00:04:03	00:04:04	48.
47	00:04:05	00:04:09	Red foam, blue tint.
48	00:04:09	00:04:12	Foam could be from blood in her lungs.
49	00:04:12	00:04:13	Edema.
50	00:04:13	00:04:15	Skin is cyanotic.
51	00:04:15	00:04:17	Maybe a blood disease.
52	00:04:17	00:04:18	Leukemia. Meningitis.
53	00:04:18	00:04:20	We'll know after the post.
54	00:04:32	00:04:35	Don't do that.
55	00:04:35	00:04:36	Excuse me?
56	00:04:36	00:04:40	These are very rare books.
57	00:04:40	00:04:42	Aaron Pratt.
58	00:04:42	00:04:43	Librarian.
59	00:04:43	00:04:46	Only other person here when the alarm sounded.
60	00:04:46	00:04:48	Did he tell you what he was doing here?
61	00:04:48	00:04:50	Oh, yeah.
62	00:04:50	00:04:52	Watching her.
63	00:04:52	00:04:54	Set off the alarm, trying to get in the cage.
64	00:04:54	00:04:56	I wasn't watching her.
65	00:04:57	00:05:08	I always say good night to Veronica 03 to catch the 8 It's three blocks away.
66	00:05:08	00:05:16	And sometimes 08, so I have to rush to catch it.
67	00:05:17	00:05:20	So you went down to the basement to say good night.
68	00:05:21	00:05:23	Good night, Veronica.
69	00:05:24	00:05:25	Good night, Aaron.
70	00:05:26	00:05:30	Sometimes she... walks me to the bus.
71	00:05:30	00:05:33	Did she walk you to the bus tonight?
72	00:05:34	00:05:36	Are you coming?
73	00:05:36	00:05:39	No. You go ahead without me.
74	00:05:39	00:05:43	I have more work to do.
75	00:05:45	00:05:48	Then...
76	00:05:48	00:05:54	a uniball pen rolled across the desk...
77	00:05:54	00:05:57	fell onto the chair...
78	00:05:57	00:06:03	hit the floor and stopped rolling at the wastebasket.
79	00:06:05	00:06:07	Then water...
80	00:06:10	00:06:15	water falls into her eyes.
81	00:06:17	00:06:19	You mean she was sweating?
82	00:06:19	00:06:23	From her forehead.
83	00:06:23	00:06:27	Lots...
84	00:06:27	00:06:31	And then, she grabs her stomach...
85	00:06:31	00:06:33	with both hands.
86	00:06:37	00:06:39	Aaron...
87	00:06:39	00:06:41	Aaron...
88	00:06:44	00:06:47	Then she put on her new face.
89	00:06:50	00:06:52	Shelley's Frankenstein.
90	00:06:52	00:06:55	Up and down...
91	00:06:56	00:07:03	flopping around like a salmon on my uncle's fishing boat.
92	00:07:05	00:07:07	She was convulsing.
93	00:07:07	00:07:10	I... couldn't help her...
94	00:07:10	00:07:15	because the cage is locked and I don't have a key.
95	00:07:15	00:07:16	Hey, there.
96	00:07:16	00:07:21	Warrick's got three residential burglaries, so...
97	00:07:22	00:07:25	Mr. Pratt will you excuse me for a moment?
98	00:07:28	00:07:32	According to O'Riley this guy's body language says he's guilty.
99	00:07:33	00:07:34	I think he's autistic.
100	00:07:34	00:07:37	Autistic? You mean like Rain Man?
101	00:07:37	00:07:39	Rain Man was a savant.
102	00:07:39	00:07:40	Extremely rare.
103	00:07:40	00:07:45	Aaron Pratt is a high-functioning autistic man with superior right-brain ability.
104	00:07:45	00:07:47	Kind of sounds like you.
105	00:07:48	00:07:50	The crime scene's in the basement.
106	00:07:56	00:07:58	Man, I hate rushing through a crime scene.
107	00:07:58	00:08:03	Two years from now, no one is going to care that the Sheriff turned this into a scoop and run.
108	00:08:03	00:08:05	Call was made above our heads.
109	00:08:05	00:08:08	Just document the time in your notes.
110	00:08:08	00:08:10	Yeah, well, I'll let you testify on this one.
111	00:08:10	00:08:12	Thanks.
112	00:08:14	00:08:17	Aw... Hey, little guy.
113	00:08:17	00:08:19	Hey.
114	00:08:19	00:08:21	Hey. Let's see.
115	00:08:21	00:08:24	His name is Maverick.
116	00:08:24	00:08:27	He lives on Martingale Street in Henderson.
117	00:08:27	00:08:29	That's not that far from here.
118	00:08:29	00:08:31	Guess I'll go call Animal Control.
119	00:08:31	00:08:32	Okay.
120	00:08:32	00:08:34	I'll be right back.
121	00:08:34	00:08:35	Hey.
122	00:08:35	00:08:37	Come on, boy.
123	00:08:37	00:08:38	Let's get you home.
124	00:08:38	00:08:41	So let me get this straight-- all you saw was a car trying to beat the signal?
125	00:08:41	00:08:43	I'm putting 55 miles an hour.
126	00:08:43	00:08:44	It's dark.
127	00:08:44	00:08:46	I got an oil leak, can't figure out where.
128	00:08:46	00:08:48	I looked up and I saw something.
129	00:08:48	00:08:49	The SUV.
130	00:08:49	00:08:51	Like I said, it was dark.
131	00:08:51	00:08:52	I thought it was stopping.
132	00:08:52	00:08:53	I turned my head for one second.
133	00:08:53	00:08:56	Next thing I know, it's in the middle of the tracks.
134	00:08:56	00:09:00	With all due respect we've got the right of way out here.
135	00:09:00	00:09:02	Thanks for your time.
136	00:09:06	00:09:07	That's not yours, is it?
137	00:09:07	00:09:09	I am collecting evidence.
138	00:09:09	00:09:11	Do we have an address on the vic yet?
139	00:09:11	00:09:12	855 Martingale.
140	00:09:13	00:09:15	Vic had a passenger.
141	00:09:15	00:09:18	Say hello to Maverick.
142	00:09:20	00:09:22	Have you finished with our lady of the library?
143	00:09:22	00:09:24	As finished as I'm going to be.
144	00:09:24	00:09:26	You were right. Cyanosis.
145	00:09:26	00:09:30	Blood was unable to oxygenate her tissue.
146	00:09:35	00:09:36	Explains the blue face.
147	00:09:36	00:09:38	Underlying cause?
148	00:09:38	00:09:40	With blood in her lungs, asphyxiation's out.
149	00:09:40	00:09:47	I found vomit in her throat bloody stool, hemolysis and some irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue.
150	00:09:47	00:09:51	I won't know more till I get the blood test back.
151	00:09:51	00:09:52	Could be blood-borne disease.
152	00:09:52	00:09:54	I'm thinking about homicide.
153	00:09:54	00:09:56	Then you know more than I do.
154	00:10:05	00:10:06	It's fine.
155	00:10:06	00:10:07	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
156	00:10:07	00:10:09	Sir, you can't come in here.
157	00:10:09	00:10:10	I told the officer upstairs.
158	00:10:10	00:10:11	I'm Stanley Hunter.
159	00:10:13	00:10:14	The curator.
160	00:10:14	00:10:17	Do you have any idea the damage you're causing?
161	00:10:17	00:10:21	With your dust, flashbulbs.
162	00:10:21	00:10:22	You see that?
163	00:10:22	00:10:23	Right there, behind you.
164	00:10:23	00:10:26	That is a 17th century text by Johannes Van Den Avelen.
165	00:10:26	00:10:30	It's one of two volumes in the world.
166	00:10:30	00:10:36	Now, do you go to the Louvre and put your hands all over the Raft of the Medusa?
167	00:10:36	00:10:40	Officer, Mr. Hunter would like to give a statement to Detective O'Riley.
168	00:10:40	00:10:41	Statement? Mm-hmm.
169	00:10:41	00:10:42	I just got here.
170	00:10:42	00:10:44	I don't even know what happened.
171	00:10:44	00:10:48	But what I do know is that these are masterpieces.
172	00:10:48	00:10:49	One of a kind.
173	00:10:49	00:10:53	They're evidence in an active criminal investigation-- also one of a kind.
174	00:10:55	00:10:57	Mr. Hunter, why don't we go upstairs and talk?
175	00:11:21	00:11:22	The good news, Nick?
176	00:11:22	00:11:24	We had a camera in here.
177	00:11:24	00:11:26	There's no surveillance system.
178	00:11:26	00:11:29	Yeah, there is-- Aaron Pratt.
179	00:11:29	00:11:33	We just have to figure out how to get the film out of his head.
180	00:12:00	00:12:01	Filament.
181	00:12:01	00:12:04	Train probably busted out her headlights.
182	00:12:04	00:12:08	First thing on our list when we get to the tow yard.
183	00:12:12	00:12:14	Catherine...
184	00:12:14	00:12:16	Check this out.
185	00:12:19	00:12:23	Two sets of skid marks.
186	00:12:24	00:12:26	One set going forward...
187	00:12:28	00:12:32	These skid marks are about seven feet shy of the gate.
188	00:12:32	00:12:39	The second set of skid marks are darker more rubber residue.
189	00:12:39	00:12:41	Could be an overlay.
190	00:12:47	00:12:49	Looks like the tires were spinning in place.
191	00:12:49	00:12:52	In reverse.
192	00:12:52	00:12:56	Burning rubber. Going nowhere.
193	00:12:56	00:13:01	So... which set of skid marks are telling the story?
194	00:13:01	00:13:03	Maybe they both are.
195	00:13:04	00:13:07	So, all of your chemicals in here are alkaline?
196	00:13:07	00:13:10	We're not dealing with the far ends of the pH range.
197	00:13:10	00:13:13	See, old book pages are slightly acidic.
198	00:13:13	00:13:15	The acid eats away the paper.
199	00:13:15	00:13:18	We neutralize them by a solution that's slightly basic.
200	00:13:18	00:13:20	To reach 7, the neutral pH.
201	00:13:20	00:13:21	Exactly.
202	00:13:21	00:13:22	Imidazole.
203	00:13:22	00:13:24	15% ammonia.
204	00:13:24	00:13:28	That's the sort of thing we work with here.
205	00:13:28	00:13:31	It's all about preserving the books.
206	00:13:31	00:13:38	No, not that you could even assign a value but do you have any idea how much each of these books is worth?
207	00:13:38	00:13:40	No.
208	00:13:40	00:13:44	The first printed book was a Gutenberg Bible.
209	00:13:44	00:13:46	It sold at Christie's for $5.3 million.
210	00:13:46	00:13:52	Lewis and Clark's Elk Skin Journal sold for $500,000.
211	00:13:52	00:13:59	We have an illustrated Audubon, the Birds of America which is worth an estimated $300,000.
212	00:13:59	00:14:03	All of that and you never thought about beefing up your security?
213	00:14:03	00:14:05	Special collections are kept in the vault.
214	00:14:05	00:14:09	Any rare book removed from the vault gets scanned through a coder.
215	00:14:09	00:14:13	If the book is to be read it's delivered to a secure room upstairs.
216	00:14:13	00:14:17	And If Veronica was going to work on it it stayed down here.
217	00:14:17	00:14:20	Is this one of the books that Veronica was restoring?
218	00:14:20	00:14:23	Yes. It...
219	00:14:23	00:14:24	it was published in 1797.
220	00:14:24	00:14:26	The author was a British botanist.
221	00:14:26	00:14:31	It's worth an estimated $300,000.
222	00:14:31	00:14:35	It's really not a dangerous profession.
223	00:14:40	00:14:42	We got a situation.
224	00:14:42	00:14:43	You know that weird guy?
225	00:14:43	00:14:47	He's not weird, O'Riley, he's autistic.
226	00:14:47	00:14:52	Whatever. First on the scene, and he's got sticky fingers.
227	00:14:53	00:14:57	But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at.
228	00:14:57	00:14:59	I am not what I am.
229	00:14:59	00:15:01	Othello, Act One, Scene One.
230	00:15:01	00:15:06	Line 61 and 62, Iago to Roderigo.
231	00:15:06	00:15:07	Very good, Aaron.
232	00:15:07	00:15:10	Now, you want to tell me how Othello ended up in your briefcase?
233	00:15:13	00:15:16	It's my... favorite Shakespeare tragedy.
234	00:15:16	00:15:17	I like Hamlet myself.
235	00:15:17	00:15:19	And I bet Mr. Hunter is into King Lear.
236	00:15:20	00:15:22	He's very concerned with property rights.
237	00:15:22	00:15:28	He tells me the rare books are kept in the vault and they're not allowed off-site.
238	00:15:28	00:15:30	Mr. Hunter doesn't like me.
239	00:15:30	00:15:32	I don't think the rule was made with you in mind.
240	00:15:32	00:15:35	He breaks the rules all the time.
241	00:15:35	00:15:37	He takes the books home?
242	00:15:37	00:15:41	No. He... eats his lunch in his office.
243	00:15:41	00:15:48	Carrots, celery tuna on whole wheat...
244	00:15:48	00:15:50	and Veronica.
245	00:15:52	00:15:54	What do you mean, and Veronica?
246	00:15:56	00:16:03	She's eating and he takes her sandwich...
247	00:16:03	00:16:07	and he puts his hand on her breasts.
248	00:16:10	00:16:15	And then he puts his tongue...
249	00:16:15	00:16:16	Aaron, I get it.
250	00:16:17	00:16:20	Did they know that you were watching them?
251	00:16:33	00:16:37	Hey, you know that filament you picked up?
252	00:16:37	00:16:38	Yeah.
253	00:16:38	00:16:41	The lamp cover's smashed, but the filament's intact.
254	00:16:41	00:16:44	So what, the filament's from another car?
255	00:16:44	00:16:48	Well, taillights have different filaments so... yeah.
256	00:16:50	00:16:51	Paint transfer.
257	00:16:51	00:16:52	Recent?
258	00:16:53	00:16:54	Hard to say.
259	00:17:01	00:17:03	You know, this right rear tire's lost a lot of rubber.
260	00:17:08	00:17:10	I got a cell phone.
261	00:17:14	00:17:18	Battery's dead.
262	00:17:18	00:17:19	Hey, Catherine...
263	00:17:19	00:17:22	her emergency brake is still on.
264	00:17:23	00:17:27	Maybe her brakes failed or she had to engage it for some reason.
265	00:17:28	00:17:30	You know, I'm thinking that maybe another vehicle was involved.
266	00:17:30	00:17:33	Engineer didn't mention anything about a second driver.
267	00:17:33	00:17:35	Maybe he didn't see it.
268	00:17:36	00:17:40	15 minutes before my next post.
269	00:17:40	00:17:43	Hey.
270	00:17:43	00:17:45	Great room.
271	00:17:45	00:17:47	Great table.
272	00:17:47	00:17:49	I could use this.
273	00:17:49	00:17:51	Lay out all the body parts.
274	00:17:51	00:17:52	Get a real overview.
275	00:17:53	00:17:54	Is that a light under there?
276	00:17:54	00:17:58	Do you have something for me?
277	00:17:58	00:18:00	Oh, your vic.
278	00:18:00	00:18:01	Poisoned.
279	00:18:01	00:18:02	Substance as yet unidentified.
280	00:18:02	00:18:06	Well, there's no smoking gun in any of these bottles.
281	00:18:06	00:18:08	What's on the label is what's in the bottle.
282	00:18:08	00:18:10	Isopropyl alcohol...
283	00:18:10	00:18:11	15% ammonia solution...
284	00:18:11	00:18:12	imidazole...
285	00:18:12	00:18:13	bleach.
286	00:18:13	00:18:17	When you isolate the toxin you'll have a better idea where it came from.
287	00:18:17	00:18:18	Nick.
288	00:18:18	00:18:20	Hmm?
289	00:18:20	00:18:22	I love this table.
290	00:18:23	00:18:27	There's no glass on the filament.
291	00:18:27	00:18:29	30 at night?
292	00:18:29	00:18:31	Crim 101.
293	00:18:31	00:18:33	If a guy's driving along at night with his lights on...
294	00:18:33	00:18:37	gets in a wreck, glass breaks fuses to the filament.
295	00:18:37	00:18:40	Instant evidence.
296	00:18:40	00:18:42	But there's no glass on the filament.
297	00:18:43	00:18:44	His headlights weren't on.
298	00:18:56	00:18:59	Black car... headlights off.
299	00:19:00	00:19:02	Easy for an engineer to miss.
300	00:19:02	00:19:04	So he hit our SUV.
301	00:19:04	00:19:08	Accidental or intentional?
302	00:19:08	00:19:10	Hard to tell.
303	00:19:10	00:19:11	Maybe not.
304	00:19:22	00:19:24	These books are from the Historical Society.
305	00:19:24	00:19:25	That's my mail.
306	00:19:25	00:19:28	Aaron, what about these books?
307	00:19:29	00:19:31	Don't... don't mix those up.
308	00:19:31	00:19:37	I have two bills due tomorrow-- gas and electric-- and I have to mail them on my way to work.
309	00:19:37	00:19:38	Don't.
310	00:19:38	00:19:40	You're messing everything up.
311	00:19:40	00:19:44	Aaron, may I have a glass of water, please?
312	00:19:44	00:19:46	Of course you may.
313	00:19:46	00:19:47	Thank you.
314	00:19:50	00:19:54	Is this guy the real deal?
315	00:19:54	00:19:56	I think he's incapable of deception, Nick.
316	00:19:56	00:19:59	We're just witnessing displaced anxiety.
317	00:19:59	00:20:01	I mean, look around.
318	00:20:01	00:20:03	Everything's in precise order.
319	00:20:05	00:20:06	Organized by size.
320	00:20:06	00:20:08	Order provides comfort.
321	00:20:08	00:20:09	His whole life is based on routine.
322	00:20:09	00:20:12	Without it, he can't function.
323	00:20:13	00:20:15	I'll check out the bedroom.
324	00:20:15	00:20:18	Mountain spring water, Calistoga, California.
325	00:20:18	00:20:20	Bottled at the source.
326	00:20:20	00:20:21	Thank you.
327	00:20:21	00:20:23	You're welcome.
328	00:20:23	00:20:24	Now, how did these books get here?
329	00:20:25	00:20:27	Veronica brought them.
330	00:20:27	00:20:29	She was here?
331	00:20:29	00:20:32	Yes, she was here.
332	00:20:32	00:20:34	We date.
333	00:20:34	00:20:37	What do you mean you date?
334	00:20:37	00:20:42	We have dinner-- roast beef, baked potato...
335	00:20:42	00:20:47	organic broccoli... Acacia Pinot Noir.
336	00:20:47	00:20:49	Shakespeare in Love.
337	00:20:49	00:20:51	DVD. Miramax.
338	00:20:51	00:20:56	M-C-M-X-C-V-I-I-I.
339	00:20:58	00:21:00	You two were involved with each other?
340	00:21:00	00:21:04	Why? Don't you think she would date someone like me?
341	00:21:04	00:21:09	No. You told me Veronica was involved with Mr. Hunter.
342	00:21:09	00:21:15	I have a Masters in Library Science and an English degree from UNLV.
343	00:21:15	00:21:22	And some people like Mr. Hunter, treat me like a freak.
344	00:21:22	00:21:24	But Veronica didn't.
345	00:21:24	00:21:28	She... loved me.
346	00:21:28	00:21:30	Not him.
347	00:21:30	00:21:31	Grissom.
348	00:21:31	00:21:34	You might want to come back here a sec.
349	00:21:36	00:21:37	Thank you.
350	00:21:46	00:21:48	Personal effects.
351	00:21:48	00:21:52	Like some creepy little shrine.
352	00:21:53	00:21:56	Vic's hair. She was seeing Hunter.
353	00:21:56	00:21:59	Aaron got jealous.
354	00:22:01	00:22:04	Incapable of deception, huh?
355	00:22:04	00:22:06	How do you feel about murder?
356	00:22:10	00:22:13	Yet she must die else she betray more men.
357	00:22:13	00:22:18	Put out the light, and then put out the light.
358	00:22:24	00:22:26	Last call on her cell phone was to 911.
359	00:22:27	00:22:30	Reel to reel's already interfaced on my computer.
360	00:22:30	00:22:32	911, what's your emergency?
361	00:22:33	00:22:35	Oh, God, you've got to help me, please, help me.
362	00:22:35	00:22:36	Ma'am, try to calm down. Where are you?
363	00:22:36	00:22:38	I'm in my car.
364	00:22:38	00:22:39	There's this maniac, he's following me...
365	00:22:39	00:22:41	Ma'am, what's your location?
366	00:22:41	00:22:42	Help me, please!
367	00:22:45	00:22:47	Can you isolate the individual tracks?
368	00:22:47	00:22:48	Yes, ma'am.
369	00:22:48	00:22:49	Good. Lose the dog.
370	00:22:49	00:22:51	Train, too, please.
371	00:22:52	00:22:55	Ma'am, what's your location?
372	00:22:55	00:22:57	Help me, please!
373	00:22:57	00:22:58	Oh, my God!
374	00:23:04	00:23:06	She was flooring it.
375	00:23:06	00:23:07	With the emergency brake on?
376	00:23:07	00:23:09	It doesn't make any sense.
377	00:23:09	00:23:12	Okay, lose the victim's voice and let's just hear the car.
378	00:23:18	00:23:20	Two engines.
379	00:23:20	00:23:21	Separate them out.
380	00:23:25	00:23:28	SUV -- sounds like any regular four-cylinder.
381	00:23:33	00:23:34	Sounds like the same thing.
382	00:23:34	00:23:36	Hang on.
383	00:23:42	00:23:43	You hear that?
384	00:23:43	00:23:46	Turbo. Probably diesel.
385	00:23:50	00:23:52	She definitely likes you.
386	00:23:55	00:23:58	You ever see The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?
387	00:23:58	00:24:02	'Cause there's something in the victim's blood that looks like one of those Heirlooms.
388	00:24:02	00:24:04	Well, it's not pulling a spectra.
389	00:24:04	00:24:06	It's not a chemical.
390	00:24:06	00:24:09	No, it's a large, ugly, globular mass.
391	00:24:09	00:24:15	You know, it's probably a protein 'cause it's the largest mass of anything in the body-- except organs, of course.
392	00:24:15	00:24:16	But it's foreign.
393	00:24:16	00:24:17	How did it get in there?
394	00:24:18	00:24:19	Cart before the horse, Nick.
395	00:24:19	00:24:23	First you identify it then you figure out where it came from.
396	00:24:25	00:24:27	I always thought you kept your porn in there.
397	00:24:27	00:24:28	I move it around.
398	00:24:30	00:24:39	Okay, now, this is a 66-kilodalton globular protein, composed of two disulfide-linked subunits, A and B.
399	00:24:39	00:24:41	Very impressive.
400	00:24:41	00:24:49	And I know what you all think of me-- I'm just another pretty face who got to where I am by sleeping with Catherine.
401	00:24:51	00:24:53	But seriously...
402	00:24:53	00:24:55	Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford.
403	00:24:55	00:24:58	Can I help it if I'm hip?
404	00:24:58	00:25:00	Yeah, yeah, which one of your relatives got you in?
405	00:25:00	00:25:02	Full ride.
406	00:25:02	00:25:04	Hey, eyes forward.
407	00:25:04	00:25:13	A and B chains link together to form a large three-dimensional structure of these beta sheets and helices.
408	00:25:13	00:25:14	Translation... Wait!
409	00:25:14	00:25:18	You just drew the molecular structure of a foreign protein.
410	00:25:18	00:25:20	Plant? Correct.
411	00:25:20	00:25:23	But, more specifically, a lectin.
412	00:25:25	00:25:28	This is nastier than I thought.
413	00:25:28	00:25:30	It's ricin, a biotoxin.
414	00:25:30	00:25:32	Biotoxin? Yeah.
415	00:25:32	00:25:40	B chain binds to glycoside residues which trigger endocytotic uptake of the protein which internalizes the toxin and begins the irreversible effects...
416	00:25:40	00:25:42	Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop now.
417	00:25:42	00:25:45	Biotoxin, as in anthrax, smallpox?
418	00:25:45	00:25:47	I was at that crime scene for eight hours, man.
419	00:25:47	00:25:48	Relax, man.
420	00:25:49	00:25:53	It takes, like, two hours for ricin symptoms to show and, like, 48 more to kill you.
421	00:25:53	00:25:55	What kind of symptoms are we talking about, here?
422	00:25:55	00:25:57	Um...
423	00:25:57	00:26:00	Sweats?
424	00:26:00	00:26:01	Cramps?
425	00:26:01	00:26:02	No.
426	00:26:02	00:26:03	Convulsions?
427	00:26:03	00:26:04	Mm-mm.
428	00:26:04	00:26:06	Then you're fine.
429	00:26:06	00:26:08	And where did you say this woman worked?
430	00:26:08	00:26:10	Western State Historical Society.
431	00:26:10	00:26:12	Hey.
432	00:26:12	00:26:15	I just got the word on our library victim.
433	00:26:15	00:26:17	How does ricin grab you?
434	00:26:17	00:26:19	Well, ricin.
435	00:26:19	00:26:24	I never would have gone there but it explains the irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue.
436	00:26:26	00:26:28	So you think she ate the poison.
437	00:26:28	00:26:35	I don't know about ate but the ricin made contact with the tongue which means you're probably looking for a powder.
438	00:27:39	00:27:41	Day in the life.
439	00:27:41	00:27:49	Megan Treadwell wakes up at home on Martingale Street puts the dog in the car, heads to work 00 a.m.
440	00:27:49	00:27:51	We know this how?
441	00:27:51	00:27:53	Brass. Talked to her boss.
442	00:27:53	00:27:55	Why the dog?
443	00:27:55	00:27:57	Dog went with her, every day.
444	00:27:57	00:27:59	00?
445	00:27:59	00:28:02	00, actually. Hard worker.
446	00:28:02	00:28:05	She packs up and leaves the office.
447	00:28:05	00:28:07	Except she doesn't go home.
448	00:28:07	00:28:08	She runs an errand.
449	00:28:09	00:28:11	I found these in the front seat of her SUV.
450	00:28:11	00:28:14	There's only one store in Las Vegas that makes them.
451	00:28:14	00:28:16	Yeah, it happens all the time.
452	00:28:16	00:28:22	Parking spaces are too narrow, and at a premium now that the restaurant moved in.
453	00:28:22	00:28:26	This guy was out of line, almost... psycho.
454	00:28:26	00:28:28	Because of this woman?
455	00:28:28	00:28:31	Yeah. Maverick's owner.
456	00:28:31	00:28:35	I think her name was um, something with an M.
457	00:28:35	00:28:36	Megan.
458	00:28:36	00:28:38	Yeah. And this guy yelled so loud.
459	00:28:38	00:28:40	I came out here just to check it out.
460	00:28:40	00:28:41	He said something like...
461	00:28:41	00:28:43	You could have killed me, bitch!
462	00:28:43	00:28:45	I heard it, too.
463	00:28:45	00:28:47	Did you see it? Kind of.
464	00:28:47	00:28:49	I mean, I didn't hear a crash or anything, just brakes.
465	00:28:50	00:28:52	It seemed like she backed out, didn't see him.
466	00:28:52	00:28:54	Happened right over there.
467	00:28:57	00:28:59	Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
468	00:28:59	00:29:01	And that set him off.
469	00:29:01	00:29:03	The last thing this guy needed was coffee.
470	00:29:03	00:29:05	Hey! What?
471	00:29:05	00:29:06	Pull your head out of your ass and use your mirror!
472	00:29:07	00:29:08	Was he a regular?
473	00:29:09	00:29:16	Double latte, tall 30 and 9 Does Mr. Double Latte have a name?
474	00:29:16	00:29:19	I think it's Croft.
475	00:29:20	00:29:21	Works right down the street-- CPA.
476	00:29:21	00:29:24	He's always telling us how to streamline our business.
477	00:29:24	00:29:26	How did Megan react to Mr. Croft?
478	00:29:26	00:29:28	She told him to go to hell.
479	00:29:28	00:29:29	Go to hell!
480	00:29:29	00:29:31	No, you go to hell!
481	00:29:31	00:29:32	You're an ass!
482	00:29:34	00:29:35	And then just drove off.
483	00:29:35	00:29:38	And what about Mr. Croft?
484	00:29:38	00:29:42	Everyone was just staring at him and then he got in his car and peeled out.
485	00:29:52	00:29:53	Ricinus communis.
486	00:29:54	00:29:56	Castor beans, like castor oil.
487	00:29:56	00:29:59	Well, botanically speaking, it's a spurge, not a bean.
488	00:29:59	00:30:01	Ricin is made from the husk.
489	00:30:01	00:30:02	Castor oil is made from what's inside.
490	00:30:02	00:30:06	Hmm, which makes two people who know that-- you and the guy who wrote the book.
491	00:30:06	00:30:07	Three, actually.
492	00:30:07	00:30:09	Someone knew how to turn this spurge into a poison.
493	00:30:09	00:30:12	Hey, guys.
494	00:30:12	00:30:13	That's Aaron's book, right?
495	00:30:13	00:30:14	Mm-hmm.
496	00:30:14	00:30:17	Shouldn't you be looking at that under a fume hood?
497	00:30:17	00:30:19	We brought this from his apartment, not his office.
498	00:30:19	00:30:21	What makes you think there's a difference?
499	00:30:21	00:30:24	He probably cooked up that ricin in his kitchen.
500	00:30:24	00:30:26	Our guys didn't find anything there.
501	00:30:26	00:30:28	So he cleans up well.
502	00:30:28	00:30:31	What, you're not feeling sorry for this guy, now, are you?
503	00:30:31	00:30:32	Hey, man, he is autistic.
504	00:30:32	00:30:34	Anybody else would be in a cell right now.
505	00:30:41	00:30:45	Yes, I've heard of ricin.
506	00:30:45	00:30:48	Georgy Markov, 1978.
507	00:30:48	00:30:59	Bulgarian political refugee in London assassinated by injection with a ricin pellet shot out of a black umbrella.
508	00:30:59	00:31:01	Died two days later.
509	00:31:01	00:31:04	Not that different from the way Veronica died, is it?
510	00:31:09	00:31:11	I found this book in your apartment.
511	00:31:11	00:31:15	What if I also told you that I found your fingerprint on this page?
512	00:31:15	00:31:19	Page 153.
513	00:31:19	00:31:21	I don't touch that book anymore.
514	00:31:21	00:31:23	But you did touch it.
515	00:31:23	00:31:26	Why are you mad at me?
516	00:31:26	00:31:27	Answer the question.
517	00:31:27	00:31:29	I don't touch this book anymore.
518	00:31:29	00:31:30	It doesn't feel right.
519	00:31:30	00:31:33	Ever since you killed Veronica.
520	00:31:33	00:31:35	I loved Veronica.
521	00:31:35	00:31:37	What do you mean, it doesn't feel right?
522	00:31:39	00:31:41	Like a new bus pass.
523	00:31:41	00:31:43	Smooth. Feel the page.
524	00:31:44	00:31:48	It used to feel like my bus pass after a month.
525	00:31:49	00:31:50	Now...
526	00:31:51	00:31:53	Rough.
527	00:31:55	00:31:59	Did you tell anyone that the illustrations felt different?
528	00:31:59	00:32:00	Yes.
529	00:32:01	00:32:04	I told Veronica and I told Mr. Hunter.
530	00:32:04	00:32:10	She said that sometimes the books feel that way after they've been restored.
531	00:32:10	00:32:11	What did Mr. Hunter say?
532	00:32:11	00:32:17	He said, Get out of my office, Aaron, I'm having my lunch!
533	00:32:18	00:32:21	Was Mr. Hunter having lunch with Veronica again?
534	00:32:21	00:32:27	Hard-boiled egg, celery, fruit salad iced tea.
535	00:32:27	00:32:29	Veronica was on a diet.
536	00:32:29	00:32:31	She had to lose three pounds.
537	00:32:31	00:32:35	Was this lunch different from the other lunches you told me about?
538	00:32:37	00:32:39	Yes.
539	00:32:39	00:32:40	How?
540	00:32:40	00:32:43	They fought.
541	00:32:43	00:32:48	Aaron, I want you to be very specific.
542	00:32:48	00:32:50	Tell me what you saw.
543	00:32:53	00:32:54	You did what?
544	00:32:55	00:32:58	All I have is my reputation and I'm not going to let you ruin it for me!
545	00:32:58	00:33:03	Veronica started crying.
546	00:33:03	00:33:06	Mr. Hunter stopped yelling.
547	00:33:06	00:33:09	He sat down.
548	00:33:09	00:33:13	He started eating.
549	00:33:13	00:33:16	He cut the hard-boiled egg in half.
550	00:33:20	00:33:26	He reached in the drawer and pulled out the salt shaker.
551	00:33:26	00:33:31	No sex, no food, no salt.
552	00:34:04	00:34:06	Poison? What are you talking about?
553	00:34:06	00:34:07	We're talking about ricin.
554	00:34:07	00:34:09	The toxin that killed Veronica Bradley.
555	00:34:09	00:34:10	You were dating her.
556	00:34:10	00:34:11	You ate lunch together.
557	00:34:11	00:34:13	Opportunity.
558	00:34:13	00:34:16	So, you mix up a batch of ricin put it in a salt shaker.
559	00:34:16	00:34:18	Next time you're breaking bread, she asks for the salt...
560	00:34:18	00:34:20	It never happened.
561	00:34:20	00:34:22	We have a witness who says he saw you try to kill her.
562	00:34:22	00:34:24	What? Aaron?
563	00:34:24	00:34:27	Are you sure you trust him?
564	00:34:27	00:34:29	Normally an eyewitness is the least reliable evidence we have.
565	00:34:29	00:34:31	But in this case, it's the most reliable.
566	00:34:31	00:34:33	Veronica knew about the forgeries.
567	00:34:33	00:34:37	A career-ender, huh, Stanley?
568	00:34:37	00:34:39	For her, not for me.
569	00:34:39	00:34:41	She's the forger.
570	00:34:42	00:34:44	Oh, there, there, there.
571	00:34:46	00:34:48	I suppose he indicted me for that, too?
572	00:34:48	00:34:50	He's the one who came to me.
573	00:34:50	00:34:52	Told me about the illustrations.
574	00:34:52	00:34:55	Said they felt like his bus pass.
575	00:34:55	00:34:57	Whatever that means.
576	00:34:57	00:34:58	Go on.
577	00:34:58	00:34:59	He even knew the page numbers.
578	00:34:59	00:35:01	So, I checked it out and he was right.
579	00:35:01	00:35:06	Veronica was using me and mea culpa.
580	00:35:06	00:35:10	Why didn't you tell us about the forgeries earlier?
581	00:35:10	00:35:13	When she died, I thought the problem was solved.
582	00:35:13	00:35:15	In this business, all you have is your reputation.
583	00:35:15	00:35:17	There was a dozen books.
584	00:35:17	00:35:22	I was going to remove them from the collection inform the board, collect the insurance and cut my losses.
585	00:35:24	00:35:28	If you don't believe me go ask your very reliable witness.
586	00:35:31	00:35:33	Tell me again, what did you see?
587	00:35:33	00:35:37	Uniball pen rolls across the desk.
588	00:35:37	00:35:43	Falls on the chair, hits the floor and stops rolling at the wastebasket.
589	00:35:44	00:35:48	Then water falls into Veronica's eyes...
590	00:35:48	00:35:53	Aaron, when you look at things you see pictures in your mind.
591	00:35:53	00:35:57	Tell me the first picture you see of Veronica in this cage.
592	00:35:57	00:35:58	I already told you.
593	00:35:58	00:36:00	Tell me something you haven't told me.
594	00:36:00	00:36:05	Tell me what Veronica was doing before you said good night.
595	00:36:05	00:36:09	She pulled out a canvas bag.
596	00:36:09	00:36:13	Then she looked around.
597	00:36:13	00:36:15	Why was she looking around?
598	00:36:15	00:36:18	She was deciding something.
599	00:36:18	00:36:24	Tell me what Veronica deciding something looks like.
600	00:36:46	00:36:48	Thank you, Aaron.
601	00:36:49	00:36:51	Veronica Bradley must have loved Uniballs.
602	00:36:51	00:36:54	She had about a dozen at her house.
603	00:36:54	00:36:56	Plus every known piece of forgery equipment.
604	00:36:56	00:37:00	Some people bite their nails; she bit her pens.
605	00:37:02	00:37:03	Bad habit.
606	00:37:03	00:37:08	I also found this under her refrigerator.
607	00:37:08	00:37:10	Funny how people don't think to clean there.
608	00:37:13	00:37:14	Castor bean.
609	00:37:14	00:37:16	Ricinus communis.
610	00:37:22	00:37:28	But if we find ricin on any of the pens from her house we'll know where she cooked up the castor beans.
611	00:37:29	00:37:30	And maybe how she died.
612	00:37:30	00:37:33	Get these to Greg right away.
613	00:37:33	00:37:35	We need the results of the ricin ELISA test.
614	00:37:38	00:37:39	I came home straight from work.
615	00:37:39	00:37:41	I don't know what you're talking about.
616	00:37:41	00:37:43	You want to submit to a lineup?
617	00:37:43	00:37:45	A lineup?
618	00:37:45	00:37:47	What for?
619	00:37:52	00:37:54	His car, out in the parking lot, it's a rental.
620	00:37:54	00:37:56	Rented this morning.
621	00:37:56	00:37:58	Let's just cut the b.s. Where's your car?
622	00:37:58	00:37:59	I sold it.
623	00:37:59	00:38:01	You got proof of sale?
624	00:38:03	00:38:05	An accountant who doesn't keep receipts.
625	00:38:05	00:38:07	Hey, you don't know anything about me.
626	00:38:07	00:38:08	I know you've got a temper.
627	00:38:13	00:38:16	Hey. Brass did the legwork and rushed the warrant.
628	00:38:16	00:38:19	Found it in a body shop a mile from his house.
629	00:38:19	00:38:24	Black Excursion. Turbo diesel.
630	00:38:27	00:38:28	Gutted.
631	00:38:28	00:38:29	Gets better.
632	00:38:29	00:38:32	Vic's SUV was silver.
633	00:38:32	00:38:35	What do you think?
634	00:38:35	00:38:39	Well, this is a lot more than a fender bender.
635	00:38:39	00:38:40	Sustained contact.
636	00:38:40	00:38:42	Get some scrapings.
637	00:38:42	00:38:43	Yeah.
638	00:39:07	00:39:08	I think I may know what...
639	00:39:09	00:39:10	set this guy off.
640	00:39:12	00:39:14	He spilled his coffee.
641	00:39:30	00:39:32	Not a good color for Croft.
642	00:39:47	00:39:52	Coffee on the outside, coffee on the inside.
643	00:39:52	00:39:54	Lipstick on the lid.
644	00:39:54	00:39:55	She threw her coffee at him.
645	00:39:57	00:40:01	Croft chases her from the parking lot caught up to her at the light.
646	00:40:01	00:40:04	They said their screw you, screw yous.
647	00:40:04	00:40:07	I think I know the word that made her throw the coffee.
648	00:40:07	00:40:08	I hate that word.
649	00:40:10	00:40:13	Those lids never fit. She nailed him.
650	00:40:14	00:40:16	Light turns green and the chase is on.
651	00:40:16	00:40:18	And now she's got a problem.
652	00:40:26	00:40:27	She's got a pursuit on her hands.
653	00:40:27	00:40:29	And she's the pursued.
654	00:40:29	00:40:30	So, she dials 9-1-1.
655	00:40:30	00:40:32	9-1-1. What's your emergency?
656	00:40:32	00:40:35	Oh, my God, you've got help me, please. Help me!
657	00:40:35	00:40:37	Somehow she loses him.
658	00:40:37	00:40:39	And she's still spooked.
659	00:40:39	00:40:42	All she wants now is to get home.
660	00:40:45	00:40:48	Please... pl-please.
661	00:40:59	00:41:01	Hey, sweetie...
662	00:41:02	00:41:04	Oh, God, no!
663	00:41:05	00:41:08	Help me!
664	00:41:11	00:41:14	That's why she had the emergency brake on.
665	00:41:26	00:41:28	She could have jumped out.
666	00:41:28	00:41:30	Not without her dog.
667	00:41:30	00:41:31	Help!
668	00:41:35	00:41:36	No!
669	00:41:50	00:41:53	And that's why you always cut the other driver some slack.
670	00:41:53	00:41:57	I'll call Brass, tell him to make the arrest.
671	00:41:59	00:42:09	Veronica removed the original illustrations from the books and replaced them with forgeries which she then left at your house so that she could point the finger at you if it ever came to that.
672	00:42:09	00:42:11	She never thought that you'd find out but you did.
673	00:42:12	00:42:14	And you told Mr. Hunter.
674	00:42:14	00:42:17	All you have in this business is your reputation.
675	00:42:17	00:42:24	So, Veronica tried to save hers but instead of killing Mr. Hunter she ended up killing herself.
676	00:42:26	00:42:28	Oh.
677	00:42:28	00:42:29	Sorry.
678	00:42:29	00:42:31	That's okay.
679	00:42:38	00:42:40	I like order.
680	00:42:40	00:42:43	Me, too.
681	00:42:44	00:42:47	That's why I was scared.
682	00:42:47	00:42:49	Scared?
683	00:42:49	00:42:54	Of Veronica being in love.
684	00:42:56	00:42:57	I was stupid.
685	00:42:57	00:43:00	I thought she loved me.
686	00:43:10	00:43:15	Then must you speak of one that loved not wisely...
687	00:43:15	00:43:17	But too well.
688	00:43:18	00:43:25	Othello, Act Five, Scene Two, lines 343 and 344.
689	00:43:25	00:43:28	But Othello killed Desdemona.
690	00:43:28	00:43:31	I didn't kill Veronica.
691	00:43:31	00:43:34	No, you didn't.
