0	00:00:52	00:00:53	Okay, folks.
1	00:00:53	00:00:54	Ball is on the wheel.
2	00:00:54	00:00:56	This is the last call for betting.
3	00:01:07	00:01:09	We have a winner!
4	00:01:09	00:01:10	Are you getting this?
5	00:01:10	00:01:11	Huh?
6	00:01:11	00:01:16	Blue plaid shirt, past posting chocolate chips at table R49?
7	00:01:16	00:01:16	We gotta shut him down.
8	00:01:16	00:01:21	Round and round she goes, where she stops, nobody knows.
9	00:01:36	00:01:40	Sir, can I help you?
10	00:01:40	00:01:40	Sorry, yes.
11	00:01:40	00:01:42	You can help me.
12	00:01:44	00:01:47	You have change for a penny?
13	00:02:21	00:02:22	This is Federal, sir.
14	00:02:22	00:02:24	It's a bomb.
15	00:02:24	00:02:27	I know it's not my jurisdiction, but it is my casino.
16	00:02:27	00:02:30	I'm on the next plane.
17	00:02:47	00:02:48	Hey.
18	00:02:48	00:02:49	Oh, great.
19	00:02:49	00:02:52	All right, all hands on deck on this one.
20	00:02:52	00:02:55	Blast circumference roughly 18 by 12.
21	00:02:55	00:02:57	We got three dead and several dozen injured.
22	00:02:57	00:02:59	So, let's-let's get on it.
23	00:02:59	00:03:01	All right, I'll look for bomb parts.
24	00:03:01	00:03:02	I'll shoot the overalls.
25	00:03:02	00:03:05	Henry and I will document the detonation blast area.
26	00:03:05	00:03:07	I'll measure, you photo.
27	00:03:07	00:03:10	So, uh, I know you're applying for the directorship.
28	00:03:10	00:03:13	Oh. Stage doesn't get any bigger than this, Sara.
29	00:03:13	00:03:15	You want this case?
30	00:03:16	00:03:17	Good.
31	00:03:17	00:03:19	It's yours.
32	00:03:21	00:03:28	I know this is gonna sound insensitive, but don't you think a bomber wearing a vest would've taken out way more people than this?
33	00:03:28	00:03:29	Yeah.
34	00:03:29	00:03:32	So, what, faulty bomb?
35	00:03:32	00:03:39	You put a vest on like that in a public place, I gotta think that you're planning on taking as many people with you as possible.
36	00:03:39	00:03:41	Yeah.
37	00:03:41	00:03:42	So, what do you think?
38	00:03:42	00:03:43	First blush.
39	00:03:46	00:03:48	Terrorism.
40	00:03:48	00:03:50	Why do you say that?
41	00:03:50	00:03:52	Vegas is terrified.
42	00:03:54	00:03:56	Let's go to the bow.
43	00:04:25	00:04:26	Sir?
44	00:04:26	00:04:27	Harbor Patrol.
45	00:04:27	00:04:29	I'm Officer Scinta.
46	00:04:29	00:04:32	These men are from San Diego PD.
47	00:04:32	00:04:34	I have orders to remove all trespassers.
48	00:04:34	00:04:36	Please show me your hands.
49	00:04:38	00:04:45	I'm gonna give you about two seconds to turn around, or I'm gonna consider you a threat and shoot you right here on this boat.
50	00:04:49	00:04:51	Shark fins.
51	00:04:51	00:04:54	Looks like somebody jumped a shark.
52	00:05:05	00:05:06	Well, you got here fast.
53	00:05:06	00:05:08	FBI has its perks.
54	00:05:08	00:05:09	How many dead?
55	00:05:09	00:05:11	Three. A lot are injured.
56	00:05:11	00:05:13	We don't have a count.
57	00:05:13	00:05:14	Anyway, she's one of ours.
58	00:05:14	00:05:16	Her name is Romina Gonzalez.
59	00:05:16	00:05:17	I saw the surveillance video.
60	00:05:17	00:05:18	You want to talk to her now.
61	00:05:18	00:05:22	She was the last person to speak to the bomber before he self-detonated.
62	00:05:22	00:05:23	Romina, hang in there, honey.
63	00:05:23	00:05:27	Mrs. Gonzalez, I'm Catherine Willows, Special Agent with the FBI.
64	00:05:28	00:05:30	I wasn't even supposed to work today.
65	00:05:30	00:05:32	I just needed the money.
66	00:05:32	00:05:34	I just need to ask...
67	00:05:34	00:05:38	could you recall your conversation you had with the bomber?
68	00:05:45	00:05:47	Are those your kids?
69	00:05:47	00:05:48	Ah, yeah.
70	00:05:48	00:05:50	Those are my babies. Oh, cute.
71	00:05:50	00:05:53	Cubano cigars-- 50 bucks a stick, right?
72	00:05:56	00:05:58	Could you come with me to the cage?
73	00:05:58	00:06:02	I just need to cash in a few chips first.
74	00:06:02	00:06:04	Sure.
75	00:06:04	00:06:07	So, he was listening to someone on the other end of an earpiece?
76	00:06:07	00:06:08	All right, check the fentanyl?
77	00:06:08	00:06:10	Yeah.
78	00:06:10	00:06:15	Tourniquet still in place? FIREMAN 2 My daughters' names...
79	00:06:15	00:06:19	are Helena and Maria.
80	00:06:19	00:06:21	All right.
81	00:06:21	00:06:23	B.P.'s dropping.
82	00:06:24	00:06:25	Doctor, we need some help over here.
83	00:06:25	00:06:26	Romina?
84	00:06:26	00:06:28	Ma'am, please step back.
85	00:06:28	00:06:29	Start compressions.
86	00:06:29	00:06:32	Go ahead to the hospital, prepare for arrival.
87	00:06:32	00:06:34	Let's start a line.
88	00:06:55	00:06:56	FBI Special Agent Willows.
89	00:06:56	00:06:59	I've been authorized by the L.A. Bureau to take over this bomb sight.
90	00:07:03	00:07:05	Sara! Catherine, hey.
91	00:07:05	00:07:06	I am so sorry. Hey.
92	00:07:06	00:07:08	What a mess.
93	00:07:08	00:07:10	Just got in from L.A. I saw the footage on the news.
94	00:07:10	00:07:12	How can I help?
95	00:07:12	00:07:14	Well, I'm not exactly sure.
96	00:07:14	00:07:15	It's a conflict of interest.
97	00:07:15	00:07:17	Legally, I'm the owner of the Eclipse.
98	00:07:17	00:07:19	This building and everything in it is my responsibility.
99	00:07:19	00:07:21	Of course, yes. Yes, it is.
100	00:07:21	00:07:25	But... you and I both know you can't be in here.
101	00:07:25	00:07:27	Three of my employees are dead.
102	00:07:27	00:07:28	What am I supposed to do?
103	00:07:28	00:07:30	Wait in the hospitality suite?
104	00:07:33	00:07:35	Look, Sara...
105	00:07:35	00:07:39	I'm not here to cause trouble, but I'm also not here to sit on the sidelines.
106	00:07:39	00:07:45	And as long as there are bodies on the floor of my father's casino, I need to continue to work this case.
107	00:07:45	00:07:47	Okay?
108	00:07:47	00:07:48	Okay.
109	00:07:53	00:07:54	I ran your name.
110	00:07:54	00:07:57	Says you used to run the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
111	00:07:57	00:08:02	Long time ago. Do you mind telling me why you're unlawfully on this vessel?
112	00:08:02	00:08:05	Well, see, that's my boat over there.
113	00:08:05	00:08:18	The poacher who owns this boat has violated It is unlawful to slice the dorsal fin off a Carcharodon Carcharias unless you bring the whole carcass ashore.
114	00:08:18	00:08:25	But white sharks can only be taken for scientific or educational purposes under permit.
115	00:08:25	00:08:27	This boat has no permit.
116	00:08:27	00:08:36	My job is to confiscate the evidence, document it and prepare it for international and/or domestic court.
117	00:08:36	00:08:38	I had to ask.
118	00:08:38	00:08:42	So, now you're what, a CSI at sea?
119	00:08:42	00:08:44	Kind of.
120	00:08:44	00:08:47	Shark fin soup is bad.
121	00:08:47	00:08:49	It's worth getting arrested for.
122	00:08:59	00:09:02	Bastard lied about needing to get money from the cage.
123	00:09:02	00:09:06	He lured Romina over after he found out she had children.
124	00:09:06	00:09:07	Pretty cruel.
125	00:09:10	00:09:12	Whew.
126	00:09:16	00:09:17	I'm good here.
127	00:09:17	00:09:19	Just release everything back to Sara.
128	00:09:19	00:09:25	As far as this piece of work-- just grab his photo and run it through NCIC, BICTOF, local DMV-- I want a name.
129	00:09:27	00:09:31	Would you have assumed this if I was a nun or a Hasidic Jew?
130	00:09:31	00:09:33	They also cover themselves based on religious belief.
131	00:09:33	00:09:37	Considering what your husband did, Mrs. Karmimi, I would.
132	00:09:37	00:09:42	Hijab or no hijab, terrorism is not a stretch if you're on my side of the law.
133	00:09:42	00:09:47	My husband converted to Islam because we fell in love, Mrs. Sidle.
134	00:09:47	00:09:51	I came to America so that I could live free as a woman.
135	00:09:51	00:09:59	Here, women have a chance to live and to love without being stoned to death.
136	00:10:01	00:10:04	To you, he's a criminal.
137	00:10:04	00:10:09	But to me, he was a husband.
138	00:10:09	00:10:12	He was my salvation.
139	00:10:16	00:10:18	Sorry.
140	00:10:18	00:10:22	Um, I-I didn't mean to offend you.
141	00:10:22	00:10:25	I'm sorry for your loss.
142	00:10:25	00:10:27	That does not forgive what he did to those people.
143	00:10:27	00:10:29	I know.
144	00:10:29	00:10:32	Mrs. Karmimi, help me.
145	00:10:32	00:10:34	If not terrorism...
146	00:10:34	00:10:38	then why would your husband strap a bomb to his body and do that?
147	00:10:38	00:10:40	I don't know.
148	00:10:40	00:10:43	My husband is not a terrorist.
149	00:10:45	00:10:49	If anything, he had a gambling problem.
150	00:10:49	00:10:53	I took him to our Imam to speak to him at the mosque.
151	00:10:53	00:10:55	I even took him to therapy.
152	00:10:55	00:10:57	Therapy for his addiction?
153	00:10:57	00:10:58	Yes.
154	00:10:58	00:11:02	He was doing well for a while.
155	00:11:02	00:11:08	But then, the therapist of his, she unexpectedly quit her practice.
156	00:11:08	00:11:11	And then he just spiraled.
157	00:11:33	00:11:36	What the hell is that?
158	00:11:37	00:11:42	Hey, you garbage men find anything gold and square, about yea big?
159	00:11:42	00:11:46	Something gold and metal flew out of the bomber's vest.
160	00:11:46	00:11:48	Chest-high, right side?
161	00:11:48	00:11:48	Yeah.
162	00:11:48	00:11:51	Why? Uh...
163	00:11:51	00:11:59	I noticed this hand-stitched lining on the inside of the bomber's vest, almost like a homemade pocket.
164	00:12:00	00:12:02	Gold metal piece.
165	00:12:02	00:12:06	I found it earlier, but I wasn't sure what it was.
166	00:12:06	00:12:11	This flew out of the bomber's right breast pocket, but this vest doesn't even have inside pockets.
167	00:12:11	00:12:16	Looks like this gold God-knows-what was purposely sewn into the vest.
168	00:12:16	00:12:17	Good catch.
169	00:12:17	00:12:21	Now, there's some kind of etching on it.
170	00:12:21	00:12:23	Maybe I can lift it.
171	00:13:16	00:13:19	Forgive me, but who is Lady Heather?
172	00:13:19	00:13:23	Uh, she's a sex therapist Grissom had a thing with back in the day-day.
173	00:13:23	00:13:28	Not, like, a sexual one, more like... an intellectual one.
174	00:13:28	00:13:31	Anyway, he worked a couple cases with her.
175	00:13:31	00:13:33	And against her.
176	00:13:33	00:13:34	So what do we think?
177	00:13:34	00:13:36	That she could be involved in this somehow?
178	00:13:36	00:13:44	We don't know, but we'd like to find out why this piece of metal with Lady Heather's initials on it flew from the bomber's jacket.
179	00:13:46	00:13:48	Sara.
180	00:13:48	00:13:50	Wait.
181	00:13:50	00:13:54	This is gonna sound like an odd request, but do you know where Grissom is?
182	00:13:54	00:13:55	Grissom? Yeah.
183	00:13:55	00:13:59	Uh, let me see, grab a globe, spin it, look for the blue, and pick an ocean.
184	00:13:59	00:14:00	He could be anywhere.
185	00:14:00	00:14:03	Why? We think Lady Heather might have something to do with the bombing.
186	00:14:03	00:14:05	Lady Heather?
187	00:14:05	00:14:10	Well, even if she did, what does that have to do with my ex-husband?
188	00:14:10	00:14:12	Lady Heather is in the wind, all right?
189	00:14:12	00:14:15	We're getting a warrant for her house, as we speak.
190	00:14:15	00:14:20	Come on, if anybody knows this woman inside and out, it's Grissom; I figured he could provide some deeper insight.
191	00:14:20	00:14:23	Conrad, with all due respect, this entire building is working the bombing case.
192	00:14:23	00:14:24	Greg and I have history with Lady Heather.
193	00:14:24	00:14:25	We-we got it covered.
194	00:14:25	00:14:28	I know, Sara, but this bombing is international news now.
195	00:14:28	00:14:31	I'd feel better if we exhaust all resources.
196	00:14:31	00:14:34	Do you at least have his cell?
197	00:14:56	00:15:00	Well, if that's the case, Conrad, then I need to come up there.
198	00:15:00	00:15:02	But you're gonna have to get me out of this first.
199	00:15:05	00:15:08	Hello.
200	00:15:08	00:15:10	Let him go?
201	00:15:10	00:15:12	Are you sure about this, Sheriff?
202	00:15:12	00:15:13	Okay.
203	00:15:13	00:15:18	I'll arrange transport and relinquish him into your custody.
204	00:15:19	00:15:20	It's your lucky day, pal.
205	00:15:20	00:15:25	I'd tell you not to leave town, but I guess you're going to Sin City.
206	00:15:25	00:15:28	Vegas.
207	00:16:36	00:16:38	Mr. Grissom?
208	00:16:38	00:16:39	Oh, my God.
209	00:16:39	00:16:41	Hi. Welcome back.
210	00:16:41	00:16:43	It's been a long time since I saw you last.
211	00:16:43	00:16:46	Oh, but, hey, check it out-- CSI Level One.
212	00:16:46	00:16:47	I did it. (chuckles)
213	00:16:47	00:16:48	You know what the crazy thing is?
214	00:16:48	00:16:50	It's my first day.
215	00:16:50	00:16:54	Do you want to take my blood or offer me a chocolate-covered grasshopper?
216	00:16:54	00:16:56	Oh, but, uh, anyway, I gotta run.
217	00:16:56	00:16:58	It was great to see you, as always.
218	00:16:58	00:16:59	See ya.
219	00:17:06	00:17:08	Sara.
220	00:17:08	00:17:09	Gil.
221	00:17:12	00:17:14	I'm back. (chuckles)
222	00:17:14	00:17:16	I see that.
223	00:17:16	00:17:19	Grissom.
224	00:17:19	00:17:20	Hey.
225	00:17:20	00:17:22	Thanks for coming.
226	00:17:22	00:17:25	Uh, let's step in D.B.'s office. Sara.
227	00:17:25	00:17:27	Who's D.B.?
228	00:17:27	00:17:30	D.B., Grissom.
229	00:17:30	00:17:32	Hi. I'm-I'm Diebenkorn Russell.
230	00:17:32	00:17:34	Pleasure to finally meet you, Gil.
231	00:17:36	00:17:38	My brains used to sit on that shelf.
232	00:17:38	00:17:40	Yeah, I, uh, traded brains for mushrooms.
233	00:17:40	00:17:42	Hope you don't mind.
234	00:17:42	00:17:45	Gil, we could really use some insight on Lady Heather.
235	00:17:45	00:17:47	The most pressing issue is this.
236	00:17:47	00:17:53	At the blast site, we found a piece of gold metal with the letters LHK inscribed on it.
237	00:17:53	00:17:56	It flew out of the bomber's suicide vest.
238	00:17:56	00:17:58	Well, that's her logo, but I don't know what this is.
239	00:17:58	00:18:02	When was the last time you spoke with her?
240	00:18:02	00:18:04	A few days ago, by phone.
241	00:18:04	00:18:07	Guess your cell service is better than it used to be.
242	00:18:07	00:18:09	Who wants to catch me up?
243	00:18:09	00:18:10	Hey.
244	00:18:10	00:18:12	I heard you were coming by.
245	00:18:12	00:18:14	Catherine...
246	00:18:14	00:18:19	because your name is on the deed to the Eclipse, it might be cleaner if you work other avenues for us, okay?
247	00:18:19	00:18:20	Sure.
248	00:18:20	00:18:25	I'll work up a chronological timeline and psychological profile on Lady Heather.
249	00:18:25	00:18:26	Good luck with that.
250	00:18:26	00:18:28	Sara, your warrant came in.
251	00:18:28	00:18:29	Lady Heather's house is all yours.
252	00:18:29	00:18:31	Perfect.
253	00:18:31	00:18:32	Grissom and I'll check it out.
254	00:18:46	00:18:49	Wow, 30 minutes in the car, no words.
255	00:18:49	00:18:52	If you were playing that silent car game, you definitely win.
256	00:18:54	00:18:57	I thought we were talking.
257	00:18:57	00:19:07	All right, uh, listen, you know, before we go in there and deal with Lady Heather, I-I just want to acknowledge that you and I haven't spoken much since the divorce, or before it, for that matter.
258	00:19:07	00:19:08	We both went our separate ways.
259	00:19:08	00:19:11	You're doing your Jacques Cousteau thing, I'm in the field.
260	00:19:11	00:19:13	Things end, I-I get it.
261	00:19:13	00:19:21	But-but you and I are professionals, and as professionals, I think it's in the best interests of the case if we put on a unified front.
262	00:19:21	00:19:23	You know, work as a team.
263	00:19:23	00:19:28	So, uh, let's put on our game faces and-and keep it professional.
264	00:19:28	00:19:31	See? Mine's on.
265	00:19:31	00:19:32	You ready to go in?
266	00:19:35	00:19:38	Seeing you again left me a little speechless.
267	00:19:40	00:19:42	Come on.
268	00:19:54	00:19:56	Dr. Kessler?
269	00:19:56	00:19:59	Las Vegas Crime Lab.
270	00:20:21	00:20:27	From 2000 to 2006, Lady Heather ran a role-playing Red Room out of her home.
271	00:20:27	00:20:32	Whips, chains, pig masks, the whole ball of sex wax.
272	00:20:32	00:20:38	In 2006, she shut down the Red Room after her daughter Zoe was murdered.
273	00:20:38	00:20:43	Overnight, her Red Room clients became therapy patients where she started her own psychiatry practice.
274	00:20:43	00:20:47	And three months ago, she abruptly shut down her practice.
275	00:20:47	00:20:48	Why?
276	00:20:50	00:20:56	This year, Lady Heather's granddaughter Alison, daughter of Zoe, was hit by a car while walking to school.
277	00:20:56	00:21:00	She died three months ago, right around the time she quit her practice.
278	00:21:00	00:21:02	You think the two incidents are related?
279	00:21:02	00:21:03	I don't know yet.
280	00:21:05	00:21:10	Lady Heather told me something a long time ago, that I never forgot.
281	00:21:10	00:21:21	She told me that there are many things that you can give a man-- your body, your time, even your heart-- but that one thing that you could never, ever, ever let go of is your power.
282	00:21:21	00:21:25	I think that she lost everything that mattered to her-- her daughter and her granddaughter?
283	00:21:25	00:21:28	I mean, it's painful enough to lose one child, but two?
284	00:21:28	00:21:32	I mean, what else does she have to live for but to wield her power of revenge?
285	00:21:32	00:21:36	Not to mention, we're dealing with a master of the human mind.
286	00:21:36	00:21:37	Yeah.
287	00:21:37	00:21:40	If anybody can convince someone to blow themselves up, it's her.
288	00:21:55	00:21:57	Hmm...
289	00:21:57	00:21:58	What?
290	00:21:58	00:21:59	Do you got something?
291	00:21:59	00:22:04	Just put my pole in the water and I got a hit.
292	00:22:04	00:22:06	What is that?
293	00:22:08	00:22:11	Sorry, I wish I had better news.
294	00:22:11	00:22:13	Especially given all the blood you guys found in Lady Heather's house.
295	00:22:13	00:22:15	None of these blood samples belong to Lady Heather.
296	00:22:15	00:22:17	Not one. Amelogenin is XY.
297	00:22:17	00:22:18	Donor's male.
298	00:22:18	00:22:21	DNA from the carpet doesn't even match the bomber.
299	00:22:21	00:22:22	So there's another male out there.
300	00:22:22	00:22:24	Along with Lady Heather.
301	00:22:24	00:22:28	Robbins found the other half of the gold metal piece inside one of the female victims.
302	00:22:28	00:22:31	Looks like a key of some sort.
303	00:22:40	00:22:41	Not just any key.
304	00:22:41	00:22:43	This is a key to Heather's Red Room.
305	00:22:43	00:22:45	Where's that?
306	00:22:45	00:22:47	The dungeon.
307	00:23:52	00:23:55	Oh, Heather, what have you done now?
308	00:24:19	00:24:23	Am I interrupting anything?
309	00:24:23	00:24:25	Only my precious thoughts, Henry.
310	00:24:27	00:24:29	Did you bring the movie?
311	00:24:29	00:24:30	Thumb drive.
312	00:24:56	00:25:00	What are you, Henry, about five-ten, 160 pounds?
313	00:25:00	00:25:03	164. Why?
314	00:25:03	00:25:05	I'm gonna make a bomb.
315	00:25:05	00:25:07	We're gonna blow you up.
316	00:25:07	00:25:08	Oh.
317	00:25:08	00:25:10	Okay.
318	00:25:10	00:25:11	Great.
319	00:25:12	00:25:17	So, um, where did you learn how to build homemade bombs?
320	00:25:17	00:25:25	And, um, does the bomb you're currently working on have, uh, any chance of blowing us up?
321	00:25:25	00:25:33	If our organization fails to put poachers in jail for pillaging our oceans, we've been known to blow holes in their boats.
322	00:25:33	00:25:34	You can do that?
323	00:25:34	00:25:36	Not legally.
324	00:25:39	00:25:40	There.
325	00:25:41	00:25:42	Put the vest on.
326	00:25:54	00:25:55	I see I'm right on time.
327	00:25:57	00:25:59	(beeping) Okay, bomb's hot.
328	00:25:59	00:26:01	Behind the wall.
329	00:26:16	00:26:18	Three, two, one...
330	00:26:39	00:26:42	Look at the blast circumference.
331	00:26:42	00:26:45	Now, look at the blast pattern from the casino.
332	00:26:45	00:26:48	Yeah, they're identical.
333	00:26:48	00:26:50	Hmm.
334	00:26:50	00:26:52	Now look at this.
335	00:26:56	00:26:59	See the outline on the brick of the C4 wrapper?
336	00:26:59	00:27:00	The rectangle?
337	00:27:00	00:27:04	There's enough explosive here to level the entire casino floor.
338	00:27:04	00:27:09	Well, based on the tool marks in the stick of putty, the bomber only used a quarter of the explosive.
339	00:27:09	00:27:12	Explains why there weren't more casualties.
340	00:27:12	00:27:16	What's bothering me is all the C4 we can't account for.
341	00:27:50	00:27:51	Sure.
342	00:28:21	00:28:22	Sit down!
343	00:28:30	00:28:32	Should I pull it now?
344	00:28:34	00:28:36	I'm gonna pull it now.
345	00:28:36	00:28:37	Hey, down in front!
346	00:28:37	00:28:41	Your seat's back here, ma'am. MAN Pull it now?
347	00:28:43	00:28:45	Hey, you're blocking the view.
348	00:28:48	00:28:49	My God, she's got a bomb!
349	00:28:49	00:28:51	(everyone screaming) Oh, my God! Go!
350	00:29:25	00:29:26	Ma'am?
351	00:29:26	00:29:31	I'm here from the Las Vegas Bomb Disposal Unit.
352	00:29:31	00:29:32	Is it okay if I approach?
353	00:29:39	00:29:40	(sirens wailing in distance) Are you doing okay?
354	00:29:43	00:29:45	(siren approaching) You're doing great.
355	00:29:45	00:29:47	I just want to check you out.
356	00:29:47	00:29:50	Can you tell me your name?
357	00:29:54	00:29:56	Ma'am, I...
358	00:29:56	00:29:58	I'm gonna have to get a little closer to take a peek.
359	00:30:22	00:30:25	I'm gonna get you out of here in no time.
360	00:30:27	00:30:28	Correction.
361	00:30:28	00:30:30	I'll get us out of here in no time.
362	00:30:30	00:30:31	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
363	00:30:31	00:30:33	You don't want to do that, ma'am.
364	00:30:33	00:30:34	You're already a hero today, ma'am.
365	00:30:34	00:30:36	All the children got out alive.
366	00:30:36	00:30:40	Why would she make me say that?
367	00:30:40	00:30:43	Someone's feeding her commands, just like the male bomber.
368	00:30:43	00:30:45	Can you get audio on the voice, male or female?
369	00:30:45	00:30:46	Anthony...
370	00:30:46	00:30:49	can you establish gender of the voice in her ear?
371	00:30:49	00:30:50	No, negative.
372	00:30:50	00:30:53	The voice is too soft.
373	00:30:56	00:30:59	I got four colored wires here.
374	00:30:59	00:31:01	I'm gonna have to cut them in order.
375	00:31:01	00:31:03	Okay...
376	00:31:05	00:31:08	I will. I'll tell him.
377	00:31:09	00:31:11	Sir?
378	00:31:12	00:31:13	Sir?
379	00:31:13	00:31:15	I'm almost there. Stop!
380	00:31:19	00:31:20	Time's up.
381	00:31:20	00:31:22	I just got one more.
382	00:31:22	00:31:25	I'm here for Lady Heather.
383	00:31:27	00:31:29	Let's go! Move!
384	00:31:29	00:31:31	Inside! Move out! Let's go!
385	00:31:31	00:31:34	Oh, my God.
386	00:31:59	00:32:01	It doesn't make sense.
387	00:32:01	00:32:06	Why wouldn't the bomber take out every man, woman and child when she could?
388	00:32:06	00:32:13	I think whoever was on the other end of that earpiece was in the process of trying to exercise control.
389	00:32:13	00:32:15	I think...
390	00:32:15	00:32:17	he was sending us a message.
391	00:32:17	00:32:18	He?
392	00:32:18	00:32:23	You don't even think there's a possibility that Lady Heather was on the other end of that earpiece?
393	00:32:23	00:32:24	I don't.
394	00:32:24	00:32:25	Gil, she's a puppeteer.
395	00:32:25	00:32:29	She's been controlling people for a living for years.
396	00:32:29	00:32:35	So, according to your theory, Lady Heather is the dominant in this scenario, giving orders.
397	00:32:35	00:32:38	And the female bomber is the submissive, taking orders, right?
398	00:32:38	00:32:43	Right. By rule, the dominant is not allowed to hurt the submissive.
399	00:32:43	00:32:48	And if, for some reason, they do, the submissive is allowed to use the safe word and discontinue the pain.
400	00:32:48	00:32:49	This is not some fetish game.
401	00:32:49	00:32:57	Sara, Heather would never hurt anyone with the intent to kill, especially innocent people and children.
402	00:32:57	00:33:01	It goes against everything she stands for therapeutically.
403	00:33:03	00:33:06	What was your safe word with her?
404	00:33:08	00:33:10	Stop.
405	00:33:10	00:33:13	We certainly could've used that word today.
406	00:33:41	00:33:43	Hello, girls.
407	00:33:43	00:33:44	My name is Catherine Willows.
408	00:33:44	00:33:46	I'm a special agent with the FBI.
409	00:33:46	00:33:50	You're probably wondering why you're here.
410	00:33:52	00:33:57	At school today, did you hear about anything happening in the news?
411	00:34:01	00:34:04	Some kid said a bomb went off?
412	00:34:04	00:34:05	That's right.
413	00:34:05	00:34:10	There was an explosion at the Eclipse hotel.
414	00:34:10	00:34:13	Mom works there.
415	00:34:13	00:34:16	I know, sweetheart, that's why I'm here.
416	00:34:16	00:34:19	Is she okay?
417	00:34:21	00:34:24	I'm sorry, honey...
418	00:34:24	00:34:27	your mother passed away earlier today.
419	00:34:37	00:34:40	But listen...
420	00:34:40	00:34:50	I want you to know that I was with your mom before she died, and she held my hand like I'm holding yours right now...
421	00:34:50	00:34:59	and she told me how proud she was of her daughters Maria and Helena.
422	00:35:01	00:35:05	What's gonna happen now?
423	00:35:05	00:35:07	Who's gonna look after us?
424	00:35:08	00:35:11	What about your father?
425	00:35:11	00:35:13	Mom was all we had.
426	00:35:13	00:35:17	We don't have anyone else.
427	00:35:22	00:35:25	I talked to the principal.
428	00:35:25	00:35:28	The woman who blew herself up was a teacher here.
429	00:35:28	00:35:30	This is her classroom.
430	00:35:30	00:35:33	According to him, she'd been put on administrative leave twice, for mental instability.
431	00:35:33	00:35:36	The school district paid for a therapist.
432	00:35:36	00:35:39	You'll never guess the name.
433	00:35:39	00:35:42	Dr. Kessler.
434	00:35:49	00:35:54	What kind of a person straps a bomb to her chest and self-detonates it at a school?
435	00:36:00	00:36:04	Perhaps someone under the influence of Devil's Breath.
436	00:36:06	00:36:07	Burundanga.
437	00:36:07	00:36:09	The most dangerous drug in the world.
438	00:36:09	00:36:12	It's a flower that grows rampant in South America.
439	00:36:12	00:36:17	One whiff of its airborne pollen, and the recipient relinquishes all control.
440	00:36:17	00:36:26	They'll do anything on command from emptying their bank accounts for strangers to putting on a suicide vest.
441	00:36:28	00:36:30	I found these on the teacher's desk.
442	00:36:30	00:36:37	My theory is that who's behind the bombings gave her these flowers right before she went into that school play.
443	00:36:37	00:36:38	Wow... (laughs)
444	00:36:38	00:36:40	Thank you.
445	00:36:40	00:36:42	Um, that's so sweet.
446	00:36:42	00:36:45	Uh, are you, are you a parent?
447	00:36:51	00:37:02	Neurologically, the drug is so potent, it literally turned off the judgment receptors in her brain, 'causing her to kill without processing the consequences.
448	00:37:03	00:37:07	So, did the first bomber, the male from the casino, have Devil's Breath in his system?
449	00:37:07	00:37:09	According to tox, no.
450	00:37:09	00:37:12	Well, I don't think the male bomber needed any extra flower power.
451	00:37:12	00:37:15	He was already pissed off at the casino for losing all his money.
452	00:37:15	00:37:19	So, what are the connections between the two bombers?
453	00:37:19	00:37:21	Both were patients of Lady Heather.
454	00:37:22	00:37:26	Is she the co-conspirator in all this, or the mastermind?
455	00:37:26	00:37:29	I think she's being framed.
456	00:37:32	00:37:42	Uh, Grissom has this theory that Lady Heather's being framed even though he doesn't have a motive and making every argument to validate her innocence, when everything that he's ever taught us about the sanctity of evidence...
457	00:37:42	00:37:45	points to her.
458	00:37:46	00:37:48	Everything you say is true.
459	00:37:48	00:37:50	But we still don't have proof.
460	00:37:50	00:37:52	So, what if it's not her?
461	00:37:52	00:37:56	Who else could it be?
462	00:37:56	00:38:00	Who might have access to things they shouldn't have access to?
463	00:39:05	00:39:07	Three months of cassettes missing.
464	00:39:17	00:39:18	Hey, Jim.
465	00:39:18	00:39:21	Go ahead, Sara. What's up?
466	00:39:21	00:39:23	Hello?
467	00:39:27	00:39:29	Jim, are you still outside?
468	00:39:29	00:39:30	I'm here.
469	00:39:30	00:39:32	There's someone in the house.
470	00:39:37	00:39:39	Dr. Kessler?
471	00:39:44	00:39:46	Dr. Kessler!
472	00:39:46	00:39:48	Stop right there! Heather!
473	00:39:48	00:39:49	Stop! Don't move!
474	00:39:51	00:39:52	Heather!
475	00:40:04	00:40:05	You okay?
476	00:40:05	00:40:07	Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right.
477	00:40:07	00:40:08	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
478	00:40:08	00:40:09	Hey, hey.
479	00:40:09	00:40:10	You have some thermal burns, okay?
480	00:40:10	00:40:11	We need to get you to the hospital.
481	00:40:11	00:40:13	Just stay with me, all right?
482	00:40:13	00:40:14	Hold onto me.
483	00:40:14	00:40:15	This is CSI Sidle.
484	00:40:15	00:40:18	I need an ambulance and the fire department.
485	00:40:19	00:40:20	Copy that, CSI Sidle.
486	00:40:20	00:40:22	(continues indistinctly) ...ambulance and fire.
487	00:41:02	00:41:04	I'm sorry, Gil.
488	00:41:37	00:41:38	Ah...
489	00:41:38	00:41:40	Yeah, I mean, we're hiring, so...
490	00:41:40	00:41:43	Hmm, yeah, well, I know that, but...
491	00:41:43	00:41:45	you weren't paying very much.
492	00:41:53	00:41:54	Hello, Heather.
493	00:41:57	00:41:59	Thank you for coming.
494	00:42:04	00:42:06	You still have your rings.
495	00:42:06	00:42:09	You never take your rings off.
496	00:42:09	00:42:11	Why would I?
497	00:42:16	00:42:18	I have to bring you in.
498	00:42:19	00:42:24	Everyone in law enforcement thinks you're responsible for these bombings.
499	00:42:28	00:42:30	I am.
