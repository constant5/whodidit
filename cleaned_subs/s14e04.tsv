0	00:00:15	00:00:21	This week on Elite Chef, we are down to the final four competitors.
1	00:00:21	00:00:24	Only one of these chefs will take home half a million dollars.
2	00:00:24	00:00:26	Will it be...
3	00:00:26	00:00:30	Ray, the firefighter turned chef?
4	00:00:33	00:00:38	Curtis, Mr. Cordon Bleu?
5	00:00:38	00:00:41	Or Cici, the private chef to the stars?
6	00:00:43	00:00:47	Or Michelle, the talented hash-slinging single mom?
7	00:00:49	00:00:54	Chefs, what would you say is the most indispensable tool in your kitchen?
8	00:00:54	00:00:56	That's easy, my knife.
9	00:00:56	00:00:58	Something even more essential.
10	00:00:58	00:00:59	My palate.
11	00:00:59	00:01:00	Very good, Michelle.
12	00:01:00	00:01:04	Today's advantage round is a palate test.
13	00:01:04	00:01:10	Each one of you gonna sample one of these four dishes and identify the mystery protein.
14	00:01:10	00:01:14	First chef to do so will win immunity for the next round.
15	00:01:14	00:01:17	Chefs.
16	00:01:21	00:01:22	Give it a try.
17	00:01:29	00:01:32	Looks like some herb-crusted meat.
18	00:01:36	00:01:37	It's not beef or pork.
19	00:01:37	00:01:38	It's too chewy.
20	00:01:38	00:01:41	Strong iron flavor.
21	00:01:41	00:01:42	Is this made from liver? Maybe lamb?
22	00:01:42	00:01:43	That's incorrect.
23	00:01:43	00:01:45	Lots of Asian spices.
24	00:01:45	00:01:50	Reminds me of a fish eye soup I had in Vietnam.
25	00:01:50	00:01:51	Definitely not a fish eye.
26	00:01:53	00:01:55	Could be... pig?
27	00:02:05	00:02:07	Oh, my God, is that a contact lens?
28	00:02:07	00:02:08	It's human!
29	00:02:15	00:02:16	It looks human.
30	00:02:16	00:02:18	But, uh, I can't say for sure.
31	00:02:18	00:02:20	You know, they're down to the final four.
32	00:02:20	00:02:25	They must shoot this show, like, six weeks ahead, because I watched last night, and there were still ten contestants.
33	00:02:25	00:02:27	Can you believe Michelle is still in the running?
34	00:02:27	00:02:30	After she served that undercooked chicken roulade to the judges last week?
35	00:02:30	00:02:33	Didn't realize you guys were such big fans of the show.
36	00:02:33	00:02:35	Good-looking people making great-looking food?
37	00:02:35	00:02:37	We love this show.
38	00:02:37	00:02:42	Well, you're gonna have to find some other show to watch until we figure out this mystery ingredient.
39	00:02:42	00:02:44	It's not caviar.
40	00:02:44	00:02:46	Definitely human blood.
41	00:02:46	00:02:48	Oh, brother. I got it right!
42	00:02:48	00:02:50	I guessed human! You all heard me say it.
43	00:02:50	00:02:52	I win immunity. Oh, come on. That's crap!
44	00:02:52	00:02:53	We were all thinking it.
45	00:02:53	00:02:54	You just said it first.
46	00:02:54	00:02:56	Nobody wins this round.
47	00:02:56	00:02:58	The mystery protein was supposed to be kangaroo.
48	00:02:58	00:03:00	It doesn't matter. I got it right. I win.
49	00:03:00	00:03:01	Ray?
50	00:03:01	00:03:02	Is that your name? Ray?
51	00:03:02	00:03:04	Yeah.
52	00:03:04	00:03:06	What made you think it was human?
53	00:03:06	00:03:08	Last time I checked, animals don't wear contacts.
54	00:03:08	00:03:14	(chuckles) But didn't you think it was a little bit odd that a show would cook and serve up a human being?
55	00:03:14	00:03:18	Mm-mm. That wouldn't be the weirdest thing to happen on a reality show.
56	00:03:18	00:03:22	This is an elite culinary competition, not Fear Factor.
57	00:03:22	00:03:25	Somebody must have sabotaged these dishes.
58	00:03:25	00:03:28	Maybe they swapped the meat to give themselves an edge up.
59	00:03:28	00:03:29	What do you think, Ray?
60	00:03:29	00:03:34	They don't exactly sell human body parts at the grocery store.
61	00:03:36	00:03:39	you steal it or you kill it.
62	00:04:15	00:04:18	You know, it's gonna be hard to I.D. our victim.
63	00:04:18	00:04:23	Once flesh has cooked, the DNA becomes denatured.
64	00:04:23	00:04:29	Yeah. There's no way an entire body was used to make these four dishes.
65	00:04:29	00:04:32	So what happened to the remains of the remains?
66	00:04:32	00:04:34	That's what I'd like to know.
67	00:04:34	00:04:35	So, who's in charge here?
68	00:04:35	00:04:36	Right here, sir.
69	00:04:36	00:04:38	Oh, there you go. Uh, ma'am?
70	00:04:38	00:04:41	Sorry. Could we, uh, talk to you for a second?
71	00:04:43	00:04:45	Hi. Executive producer, Nadine Bradley.
72	00:04:45	00:04:47	Uh, how long is this going to take?
73	00:04:47	00:04:49	Because we were right in the middle of filming.
74	00:04:49	00:04:53	Ms. Bradley, you-you called us when you found human body parts in your food.
75	00:04:53	00:04:55	We're gonna need to find out how that happened.
76	00:04:55	00:05:03	Yeah, well, we're the highest rated culinary competition show on air, so any of our rivals could've pulled a stunt like this to try and sabotage us.
77	00:05:03	00:05:05	Or an eliminated contestant.
78	00:05:05	00:05:07	The prize money is just the beginning.
79	00:05:07	00:05:11	Your past winners have gone on to open their own restaurants, become celebrity chefs.
80	00:05:11	00:05:13	A win is worth millions.
81	00:05:13	00:05:15	I doubt any of them are involved.
82	00:05:15	00:05:21	The eliminated contestants are sequestered at a nearby hotel-- we don't want viewers knowing who's been kicked off.
83	00:05:21	00:05:24	We're gonna also need to see your footage from the last 48 hours.
84	00:05:24	00:05:29	We have 13 cameras on this stage, seven in the house set where the remaining contestants live.
85	00:05:29	00:05:31	Are they on all the time? No.
86	00:05:31	00:05:33	00.
87	00:05:33	00:05:36	That's still over 500 hours of footage.
88	00:05:36	00:05:38	So, this was a palate test.
89	00:05:38	00:05:42	The contestants did not cook the food. Who did?
90	00:05:42	00:05:45	We have a team of prep chefs who use the kitchen set after-hours.
91	00:05:45	00:05:46	00 last night.
92	00:05:46	00:05:50	Went and did an event at the Palermo, 00 this morning.
93	00:05:50	00:05:52	We're still gonna need to talk to 'em though.
94	00:05:52	00:05:53	Who had access to the kitchen last night?
95	00:05:53	00:05:55	The contestants and the entire crew. (phone ringing)
96	00:05:55	00:05:57	That's legal. Sorry.
97	00:05:57	00:05:58	I have to take this.
98	00:06:00	00:06:02	Cast and crew?
99	00:06:02	00:06:04	That is over 100 suspects.
100	00:06:04	00:06:06	Well...
101	00:06:06	00:06:08	body was cooked in the kitchen.
102	00:06:08	00:06:10	Can't believe I just said that.
103	00:06:10	00:06:12	Start in the kitchen.
104	00:06:36	00:06:40	I just found human blood down that drain.
105	00:06:40	00:06:43	Hmm. Could be the body was dismembered here.
106	00:06:43	00:06:44	Can you hand me that luminol, please?
107	00:06:44	00:06:46	Sure.
108	00:06:46	00:06:47	I'll get the lights.
109	00:06:47	00:06:49	Thanks.
110	00:06:59	00:07:00	That's a large volume of blood.
111	00:07:00	00:07:02	Lights, please.
112	00:07:02	00:07:04	Means we're not looking at a stolen body.
113	00:07:04	00:07:06	We're looking at murder.
114	00:07:06	00:07:12	00, so the murder must have happened after that.
115	00:07:12	00:07:16	You know, these gel mats can hold an impression for up to 12 hours.
116	00:07:16	00:07:18	Very close to the blood pool.
117	00:07:18	00:07:21	Maybe we can I.D. the last person who stepped on it.
118	00:07:26	00:07:28	Might be our killer.
119	00:07:30	00:07:33	You've heard how Jesus turned water into wine.
120	00:07:33	00:07:38	Now watch in amazement as I turn blood into caviar.
121	00:07:38	00:07:41	You're comparing yourself to Jesus?
122	00:07:41	00:07:42	Wow.
123	00:07:42	00:07:46	First, I take the blood and add it to a mixture of...
124	00:07:46	00:07:50	calcium glucocinate and calcium lactate.
125	00:07:50	00:07:56	Next, I add xanthan, a polysaccharide secreted from the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris.
126	00:07:56	00:08:01	Used as a thickening agent in food and a stabilizing agent in makeup.
127	00:08:01	00:08:03	I took chemistry, too.
128	00:08:03	00:08:06	Blend until thoroughly dissolved.
129	00:08:08	00:08:15	I take my handy pipette, extract some of the blood mixture and drop it into the alginate one drop at a time.
130	00:08:19	00:08:28	I will pull the sphere from the alginate, plunge it into an ice-cold water bath and...
131	00:08:28	00:08:30	buon appetito.
132	00:08:30	00:08:33	(chuckles) I'll pass, thanks.
133	00:08:33	00:08:38	As you can see, molecular gastronomy requires great skill and an aptitude for chemistry.
134	00:08:38	00:08:41	Something not all chefs possess.
135	00:08:41	00:08:44	So we still don't have a suspect. No.
136	00:08:44	00:08:46	But I have a very good idea who the victim might be.
137	00:08:46	00:08:48	Graham Deveraux is missing.
138	00:08:48	00:08:49	Who's that?
139	00:08:49	00:08:52	One of the founding fathers of molecular gastronomy.
140	00:08:52	00:08:55	He has a Michelin-star restaurant on the Strip.
141	00:08:55	00:08:56	He was the guest judge.
142	00:08:56	00:08:58	Taped an episode of Elite Chef yesterday.
143	00:08:58	00:09:01	And then this morning, did not show up for work.
144	00:09:01	00:09:03	You think he's the one in the soup?
145	00:09:03	00:09:07	Well, he did have a very big confrontation with the contestant who was just eliminated.
146	00:09:07	00:09:10	I wouldn't feed it to my dog. And I hate my dog.
147	00:09:10	00:09:13	This looks like a big mess on a plate.
148	00:09:13	00:09:20	No sense of presentation. The presentation was flawed, but I think that it was seasoned very well. But you seem to fail to appreciate there are other spices than pepper.
149	00:09:20	00:09:25	I would call you Chef, but that would demean the entire profession. (scoffs)
150	00:09:25	00:09:26	That guy's just mean.
151	00:09:26	00:09:28	I think he's being honest.
152	00:09:28	00:09:31	Derek, I'm sorry, but you are not the Elite Chef.
153	00:09:31	00:09:37	I believe you have some passion for food, and maybe someday you'll have your own restaurant.
154	00:09:37	00:09:41	Where he will probably kill someone with salmonella poisoning.
155	00:09:41	00:09:42	Your cooking is horrific, Mr. Barlow.
156	00:09:42	00:09:46	Do restaurant patrons a favor everywhere and get out of the food industry.
157	00:09:47	00:09:48	Call security!
158	00:09:48	00:09:49	Get him off me!
159	00:09:51	00:09:53	You know what? You better watch your back, Deveraux.
160	00:09:53	00:09:55	Okay.
161	00:09:55	00:09:57	That was a threat.
162	00:09:57	00:10:02	Derek was such a nice guy on the show, but I guess even nice guys have their breaking point.
163	00:10:02	00:10:04	(beeping) Back a bit more.
164	00:10:05	00:10:08	Keep it coming.
165	00:10:08	00:10:13	That's great. Perfect. Thanks. Lucky you managed to stop the garbage truck before it made it to the dump.
166	00:10:13	00:10:17	All the trash collected from Elite Chef this morning is still inside.
167	00:10:19	00:10:22	You talk to the driver? Yeah, didn't notice anything suspicious.
168	00:10:22	00:10:26	With all that rotting food inside, hard to tell if there's a body.
169	00:10:29	00:10:35	This could take a while. Well, we only have to go through the green bags, 'cause those are the ones that the studio uses.
170	00:10:48	00:10:49	Maggots.
171	00:10:49	00:10:51	I don't even notice anymore.
172	00:10:58	00:11:00	Got an arm.
173	00:11:02	00:11:03	Definitely male.
174	00:11:03	00:11:05	Mr. Deveraux, I presume. Hard to say.
175	00:11:05	00:11:10	Henry wasn't able to extract a DNA profile from the blood found in the kitchen.
176	00:11:10	00:11:12	Looks like some of the flesh has been excised.
177	00:11:12	00:11:15	Probably used to make that herb-crusted meat.
178	00:11:17	00:11:19	Let's see if we can find the rest of him.
179	00:11:20	00:11:23	Those look like fried mac and cheese balls.
180	00:11:25	00:11:27	Definitely not mac and cheese.
181	00:11:27	00:11:29	I think it's something else.
182	00:11:29	00:11:31	Rocky Mountain Oysters.
183	00:11:31	00:11:33	Aren't those fried bull testicles?
184	00:11:33	00:11:35	Indeed, they are, and quite delicious.
185	00:11:35	00:11:37	It's like a light chicken nugget.
186	00:11:37	00:11:39	But they're about three times bigger than this.
187	00:11:41	00:11:43	This is an orchidometer.
188	00:11:43	00:11:45	It measures testicle size.
189	00:11:45	00:11:49	And these are consistent with that of an adult human.
190	00:11:49	00:11:51	Guess the killer didn't want to waste anything.
191	00:11:51	00:11:53	Ugh. Gross.
192	00:11:53	00:11:55	Hey, did you ever hear about that Japanese chef?
193	00:11:55	00:12:02	He removed his own genitals, and then served them at a dinner party for $250 plate.
194	00:12:02	00:12:04	Lowballed.
195	00:12:05	00:12:07	Look at that.
196	00:12:07	00:12:09	Dark pigmentation on the chicharone.
197	00:12:09	00:12:11	Maybe I can reconstitute it.
198	00:12:31	00:12:33	That's a tattoo.
199	00:12:33	00:12:34	Where have I seen that before?
200	00:12:37	00:12:41	I would call you chef, but that would demean the entire profession.
201	00:12:41	00:12:45	That's the tattoo, but that's not Graham Deveraux.
202	00:12:45	00:12:46	No, that's Derek Barlow.
203	00:12:46	00:12:47	Who was just eliminated from the show?
204	00:12:47	00:12:50	And now eliminated for good.
205	00:12:54	00:12:56	So, Derek Barlow is not our killer.
206	00:12:56	00:12:58	He's our victim. DNA just confirmed it.
207	00:12:58	00:13:00	Okay, where's Deveraux?
208	00:13:00	00:13:01	Still unaccounted for.
209	00:13:01	00:13:05	Oh. A lot of killers miss work the day after they commit murder.
210	00:13:05	00:13:10	Anyway, we know that Deveraux had an altercation with Barlow yesterday.
211	00:13:10	00:13:14	Maybe we have the right players, just in the wrong roles.
212	00:13:14	00:13:16	You ask me, they're both scumbags.
213	00:13:16	00:13:18	Especially Derek.
214	00:13:18	00:13:22	I know, as a producer, I'm supposed to be impartial, but that guy was a piece of work.
215	00:13:22	00:13:24	He did not appear that way on the show.
216	00:13:24	00:13:30	He was a great chef, and I wanted the audience to root for him, so I cut out a lot of the stuff where he was being an ass.
217	00:13:30	00:13:33	I can show you the raw footage.
218	00:13:33	00:13:34	Sure.
219	00:13:42	00:13:44	What the hell?!
220	00:13:44	00:13:46	Why don't you pick up your mess, sweetheart?
221	00:13:46	00:13:47	You're such an ass!
222	00:13:49	00:13:50	Mmm!
223	00:13:50	00:13:55	That is exactly how I like seeing my ladies in the kitchen-- on their hands and knees.
224	00:13:55	00:13:57	Ugh.
225	00:13:57	00:13:58	That's just the tip of the iceberg.
226	00:13:58	00:14:00	He tried to sabotage all the contestants.
227	00:14:00	00:14:02	Now this seems personal.
228	00:14:02	00:14:05	I mean, who would have hated him enough to want to cook him?
229	00:14:05	00:14:09	To be honest, I wouldn't put it past any of them.
230	00:14:09	00:14:10	Derek tried to sabotage me.
231	00:14:10	00:14:11	Well, screw him.
232	00:14:13	00:14:15	I always thought his cooking was overrated.
233	00:14:15	00:14:18	He's gone, and I'm in the final four.
234	00:14:18	00:14:21	With Derek out of the way, I really think I can win this thing.
235	00:14:21	00:14:24	Greg and I were able to recover most of Derek Barlow.
236	00:14:24	00:14:27	At least the parts that didn't make it to the dinner table.
237	00:14:27	00:14:34	You know, I read somewhere that the Yanomamo tribe in the Amazon consume pieces of their deceased loved ones as an act of mourning.
238	00:14:34	00:14:37	A way of keeping them alive within them.
239	00:14:37	00:14:39	Well, I don't think that was the case with Mr. Barlow here.
240	00:14:39	00:14:41	Finlay said everyone hated him.
241	00:14:41	00:14:46	Yes, but at least the killer was kind enough to kill Mr. Barlow before they dismembered and cooked him.
242	00:14:46	00:14:50	Look at the margins near the disarticulations.
243	00:14:50	00:14:51	Skin is blanched.
244	00:14:51	00:14:53	Orange in color.
245	00:14:53	00:14:55	Blood wasn't circulating.
246	00:14:55	00:14:57	May I?
247	00:14:57	00:14:59	Go ahead.
248	00:14:59	00:15:01	Looks like he's had a head injury.
249	00:15:01	00:15:04	Found that examining underneath his hairline.
250	00:15:04	00:15:07	Based on the bruising, at least 48 hours old.
251	00:15:07	00:15:08	It's unrelated to his death.
252	00:15:08	00:15:10	So, what's C.O.D.?
253	00:15:10	00:15:12	Exsanguination due to multiple sharp force injuries.
254	00:15:12	00:15:22	Based on the width and depth of the wounds, I'd say the killer used a single-edged knife with approximately a seven-inch blade.
255	00:15:22	00:15:25	Do you think the killer used the same knife to dismember him?
256	00:15:25	00:15:26	No, I don't believe so.
257	00:15:26	00:15:29	Look at the radius and ulna here-- not a mark on them.
258	00:15:29	00:15:33	The flesh was removed with great skill and with the proper knife.
259	00:15:33	00:15:35	A boning knife.
260	00:15:35	00:15:38	Yeah, something any professional chef would have.
261	00:15:38	00:15:41	Now, the stabbing, however, was less precise.
262	00:15:41	00:15:43	I noted tool marks on the ribs.
263	00:15:46	00:15:52	Well, if we can microsil the tool marks, we may be able to indentify the knife and our killer.
264	00:15:52	00:15:55	Rod Steward.
265	00:15:55	00:15:58	I love his music, but what's he got to do with this?
266	00:15:58	00:15:59	No, that's Rod Stewart.
267	00:15:59	00:16:00	This is Rod Steward, with a D.
268	00:16:00	00:16:02	He's a designer of high-end men's shoes.
269	00:16:02	00:16:04	Very expensive.
270	00:16:04	00:16:08	His size-ten loafer matches an impression on the gel mat that Finn found at the crime scene.
271	00:16:08	00:16:13	Well, that's interesting, 'cause when I was on the set, I noticed most of the crew wearing running shoes.
272	00:16:13	00:16:15	So did a lot of the contestants.
273	00:16:15	00:16:17	Well, up-and-coming chefs don't make a lot of money.
274	00:16:17	00:16:19	But celebrity chefs do.
275	00:16:19	00:16:22	Graham Deveraux, our missing judge.
276	00:16:22	00:16:23	Not missing anymore.
277	00:16:36	00:16:39	You feeling better?
278	00:16:39	00:16:42	Oh, just dandy.
279	00:16:42	00:16:44	Lot of people have been looking for you.
280	00:16:44	00:16:45	What can I say?
281	00:16:45	00:16:47	I'm a popular guy.
282	00:16:47	00:16:49	You're also the lead suspect in a homicide investigation.
283	00:16:49	00:16:51	What are you talking about?
284	00:16:51	00:16:56	Derek Barlow, the contestant who attacked you-- he was murdered last night.
285	00:16:56	00:16:59	Oh.
286	00:16:59	00:17:02	Barlow is dead. Huh.
287	00:17:02	00:17:05	He was stabbed to death in the Elite Chef kitchen.
288	00:17:06	00:17:08	No.
289	00:17:08	00:17:11	Well, that counts me out.
290	00:17:11	00:17:13	Judges aren't allowed in that kitchen.
291	00:17:13	00:17:15	It's against the rules.
292	00:17:15	00:17:26	If it's against the rules, then how do you explain the fact that we found an impression of your size ten Rod Steward loafer in the kitchen of Elite Chef right next to where Derek Barlow was murdered?
293	00:17:30	00:17:34	Because I was there, but not with Barlow.
294	00:17:34	00:17:37	That hot female contestant-- what was her name?
295	00:17:37	00:17:39	Uh, Cici? Yeah.
296	00:17:39	00:17:42	She was showing me her secret rub recipe.
297	00:17:42	00:17:43	What time? I don't know.
298	00:17:43	00:17:46	00, after we finished filming.
299	00:17:46	00:17:52	And after your little hookup, you arranged for Derek to meet you in the kitchen so you could teach him a little lesson.
300	00:17:52	00:17:56	Payback for attacking you on the show.
301	00:17:56	00:17:59	Derek Barlow wasn't just murdered.
302	00:17:59	00:18:04	He was carved up, cooked, and his blood turned into caviar.
303	00:18:04	00:18:08	Molecular gastronomy-- which also happens to be your area of expertise.
304	00:18:08	00:18:15	Look, any idiot can try their hand at molecular gastronomy for the bargain price of $59.99.
305	00:18:15	00:18:17	You just buy a kit online.
306	00:18:17	00:18:19	00 last night?
307	00:18:19	00:18:24	Uh, I was in a limo downtown doing body shots of tequila off two lovely young ladies.
308	00:18:24	00:18:26	You can ask them if you don't believe me.
309	00:18:26	00:18:29	Their names were Candy and Brown Sugar.
310	00:18:33	00:18:35	So, you have something for me?
311	00:18:35	00:18:38	I found kratom in Derek Barlow's stomach contents.
312	00:18:38	00:18:40	It's a leafy herb from Thailand.
313	00:18:40	00:18:42	Makes the ingestor irritable and on edge.
314	00:18:42	00:18:44	So, Barlow was drugged.
315	00:18:44	00:18:47	Might explain why he attacked Graham Deveraux last night.
316	00:18:47	00:18:49	In high doses, that herb can be fatal.
317	00:18:49	00:18:56	So, what if someone tried to poison him, but it didn't work, so the killer had to stab him instead?
318	00:18:56	00:18:58	Plausible theory. Mm-hmm.
319	00:18:58	00:19:02	Oh, uh, where are you and Elisabetta registered?
320	00:19:02	00:19:04	I wanted to make sure that I got you something you need.
321	00:19:04	00:19:06	That's very kind of you.
322	00:19:06	00:19:09	But, honestly, I have no idea.
323	00:19:09	00:19:12	Elisabetta is in charge of all things nuptial.
324	00:19:12	00:19:14	Really? All I got to do is get to the church on time.
325	00:19:14	00:19:15	That's funny.
326	00:19:15	00:19:19	I always thought of you as a detail-oriented kind of guy.
327	00:19:19	00:19:23	And yet, you're not even interested in planning the most important day of your life?
328	00:19:23	00:19:25	Well, work keeps me very busy.
329	00:19:25	00:19:31	Can I give you some advice, coming from somebody who's been down the aisle a couple times?
330	00:19:31	00:19:34	You should, um... you should get involved.
331	00:19:34	00:19:35	You should have an opinion.
332	00:19:35	00:19:37	You know, band, DJ.
333	00:19:37	00:19:38	Roses, lilies.
334	00:19:38	00:19:48	I know it may not seem important, but if the groom does not really care about the wedding, it makes the bride feel like you don't really care about her.
335	00:19:48	00:19:51	It's... symbolic.
336	00:20:03	00:20:06	Analyzed the tool marks on Barlow's rib cage.
337	00:20:06	00:20:09	Turns out, he was stabbed by his own knife.
338	00:20:09	00:20:12	Guess the, uh, chefs all have their own distinct set of knives.
339	00:20:12	00:20:13	They're all kept in the kitchen.
340	00:20:13	00:20:17	Where anyone in the cast or crew has access.
341	00:20:17	00:20:21	Doesn't help us narrow down our list of suspects at all.
342	00:20:21	00:20:24	But this might.
343	00:20:24	00:20:25	Curtis LeBlanc, one of the contestants.
344	00:20:25	00:20:28	But according to that, he used to be Curtis Gant.
345	00:20:28	00:20:32	It looks like Mr. Cordon Bleu has a record.
346	00:20:32	00:20:36	Back in 2001, he served four years for possession with intent to sell.
347	00:20:36	00:20:38	Didn't the show do a background check?
348	00:20:38	00:20:40	Well, according to the producer, just cursory ones.
349	00:20:40	00:20:43	Mainly to validate culinary history.
350	00:20:43	00:20:48	But if Curtis lied to the show about his criminal past, that would be cause for elimination.
351	00:20:48	00:20:51	Maybe Barlow found out about Curtis's secret, threatened to expose him.
352	00:20:51	00:20:53	Now that would be motive for murder.
353	00:20:53	00:20:56	I perfected my craft in kitchens all over the world.
354	00:20:56	00:20:58	It's my time now.
355	00:20:58	00:21:00	No one's gonna stand in my way.
356	00:21:02	00:21:06	Well, congratulations, Mr. LeBlanc.
357	00:21:06	00:21:09	Word on the street is you're the odds-on favorite to win Elite Chef.
358	00:21:10	00:21:17	Not bad for an ex-con who honed his culinary skills making vats of mystery meat stew in the federal pen.
359	00:21:17	00:21:19	Of course, you were Curtis Gant back then.
360	00:21:22	00:21:24	Look, I-I was, um...
361	00:21:24	00:21:26	I was a new man when I got out.
362	00:21:26	00:21:29	A better man, so... so I changed my name.
363	00:21:29	00:21:30	But you didn't tell the show.
364	00:21:30	00:21:33	You actually lied about your criminal past.
365	00:21:33	00:21:35	And if they had found out, you would have been kicked off.
366	00:21:35	00:21:38	You would have lost your shot at a half a million dollars.
367	00:21:38	00:21:41	Only one person on the show knew your secret.
368	00:21:41	00:21:42	That was your buddy, Derek Barlow.
369	00:21:42	00:21:45	As it turns out, you guys go way back.
370	00:21:45	00:21:48	You were frat brothers at Brassard University in Florida.
371	00:21:48	00:21:50	Friends ever since.
372	00:21:50	00:21:52	Even roommates here on the show.
373	00:21:52	00:21:55	But, I mean, let's face it.
374	00:21:55	00:22:01	Half a million dollars-- that could turn even the best of friends into enemies.
375	00:22:01	00:22:02	What happened?
376	00:22:02	00:22:04	Barlow threatened to expose your secret?
377	00:22:04	00:22:07	Is that why you killed him?
378	00:22:07	00:22:10	We know that you tried to poison him earlier in the day.
379	00:22:10	00:22:14	We found trace amounts of the herb kratom in his stomach contents.
380	00:22:14	00:22:19	You special-ordered it from Thailand two weeks ago, so give me a break.
381	00:22:19	00:22:24	But that didn't kill him, so you lured him into the kitchen and you stabbed him to death.
382	00:22:27	00:22:29	I didn't kill Derek.
383	00:22:29	00:22:31	I wasn't even in the kitchen last night.
384	00:22:31	00:22:33	I didn't stab him and I wasn't trying to poison him.
385	00:22:33	00:22:35	I just...
386	00:22:35	00:22:41	I gave him a little kratom to-to make him sick, to throw him off his game.
387	00:22:41	00:22:44	Derek was always better than me...
388	00:22:44	00:22:46	at everything.
389	00:22:46	00:22:48	Even on the show, he was winning every challenge.
390	00:22:48	00:22:51	I... just needed an edge.
391	00:22:51	00:22:54	So, after you edged out Derek, where did you go?
392	00:22:54	00:22:56	Back to our room.
393	00:22:56	00:22:57	How long did you stay there?
394	00:22:57	00:22:58	All night.
395	00:22:58	00:23:00	Drank till I passed out.
396	00:23:00	00:23:02	Look, I-I wasn't trying to get Derek eliminated.
397	00:23:02	00:23:05	I just wanted to win.
398	00:23:07	00:23:09	Nice digs for a reality show.
399	00:23:11	00:23:22	So Derek Barlow was killed in the kitchen 00 and 6 which means Curtis LeBlanc could have left this room anytime during that window and the cameras wouldn't have picked him up.
400	00:23:22	00:23:26	Barlow was stabbed multiple times, dismembered.
401	00:23:26	00:23:27	Must have been a lot of blood.
402	00:23:27	00:23:29	Killer would have definitely gotten some on him.
403	00:23:29	00:23:32	Let's see if LeBlanc took some to go.
404	00:24:06	00:24:08	Morgan, look at this.
405	00:24:10	00:24:12	A fingerprint in blood.
406	00:24:12	00:24:15	Looks like it might have been used as a weapon.
407	00:24:15	00:24:18	Didn't Barlow have a blunt force trauma to his head?
408	00:24:18	00:24:19	Two days before he was killed.
409	00:24:19	00:24:26	Maybe that's when Barlow threatened to go to the executive producers and tell them about Curtis's prison time.
410	00:24:26	00:24:28	They got into a fight.
411	00:24:28	00:24:29	Then it got physical.
412	00:24:29	00:24:31	What are you gonna do, huh?
413	00:24:32	00:24:39	After the fight, Barlow promises to keep his mouth shut, but Curtis can't take the chance, so two nights later...
414	00:24:43	00:24:47	LeBlanc may have cleaned up the kitchen, but he left a mess here.
415	00:24:47	00:24:48	Could send him right back to prison.
416	00:24:54	00:24:56	The alarm clock that we found under Curtis LeBlanc's bed?
417	00:24:56	00:24:58	Blood on it belonged to the victim Derek Barlow.
418	00:24:58	00:25:00	Was the fingerprint LeBlanc's?
419	00:25:00	00:25:02	No, but it did match another one of the contestants.
420	00:25:02	00:25:05	Huh, Michelle Rowlands.
421	00:25:05	00:25:06	She's kind of the underdog on the show.
422	00:25:06	00:25:08	She's tough.
423	00:25:08	00:25:09	Tough enough to commit murder?
424	00:25:09	00:25:11	I miss my daughter so much.
425	00:25:11	00:25:13	Losing is not an option.
426	00:25:13	00:25:15	Michelle, I'm impressed.
427	00:25:15	00:25:19	You made it to the final four of an elite culinary competition.
428	00:25:19	00:25:21	You're a diner chef from Ohio.
429	00:25:21	00:25:23	And a woman.
430	00:25:23	00:25:25	I mean, I worked twice as hard as the guys to get where I am.
431	00:25:25	00:25:28	Yeah, I hear the culinary world can be a bit of a boys club.
432	00:25:30	00:25:31	That's an understatement.
433	00:25:31	00:25:34	And Derek Barlow is their poster boy.
434	00:25:34	00:25:37	We know that he sabotaged you more than once.
435	00:25:37	00:25:40	You must have been very happy when Derek was kicked off the show.
436	00:25:40	00:25:41	He got what he deserved.
437	00:25:41	00:25:44	In more ways than one.
438	00:25:44	00:25:48	We found this alarm clock in Curtis and Derek's room.
439	00:25:48	00:25:51	That there is your fingerprint in Derek's blood.
440	00:25:51	00:25:53	What happened, Michelle?
441	00:25:53	00:25:56	Had you had enough of his abuse?
442	00:25:56	00:25:59	Decide to get back at him for how he treated you?
443	00:25:59	00:26:04	You obviously got into an altercation with him in his room, and two days later he's dead.
444	00:26:04	00:26:06	I didn't kill him.
445	00:26:06	00:26:12	You had motive, opportunity, and you certainly had the skill set to cut him up and cook him.
446	00:26:12	00:26:14	It's premeditated murder.
447	00:26:16	00:26:20	A cou... a couple nights ago, Derek invited me to his room.
448	00:26:20	00:26:22	Curtis wasn't there.
449	00:26:22	00:26:24	He said he wanted to form an alliance.
450	00:26:24	00:26:26	He gave me a drink.
451	00:26:26	00:26:28	Tasted like licorice.
452	00:26:28	00:26:36	There must have been something in it, because next thing I knew, I woke up and...
453	00:26:36	00:26:38	Derek was on top of me.
454	00:26:38	00:26:40	His hand around my throat.
455	00:26:40	00:26:42	No, stop, please, stop!
456	00:26:42	00:26:43	Shut up.
457	00:26:43	00:26:47	I couldn't get him off of me, so I grabbed the alarm clock and...
458	00:26:49	00:26:52	...then I got out of there.
459	00:26:52	00:26:56	Well, how come you didn't contact the police, Ms. Rowlands?
460	00:26:56	00:26:59	It was just the two of us in there.
461	00:26:59	00:27:02	It would have been my word against his.
462	00:27:02	00:27:04	Besides...
463	00:27:04	00:27:07	a female chef accusing a male chef of rape?
464	00:27:08	00:27:10	I would have never worked again.
465	00:27:10	00:27:14	You know, I gave up everything to be here.
466	00:27:14	00:27:17	You know, quit my job, used up my savings.
467	00:27:17	00:27:19	Weeks away from my daughter.
468	00:27:20	00:27:23	All of it would have been for nothing.
469	00:27:25	00:27:28	You know, I'm not sorry Derek is dead.
470	00:27:29	00:27:32	But I didn't kill him.
471	00:27:32	00:27:36	So, this was shot two days before Derek Barlow was murdered.
472	00:27:36	00:27:41	According to Michelle Rowlands, 00 p.m.
473	00:27:41	00:27:44	If she's telling the truth.
474	00:27:44	00:27:45	Well, there she is.
475	00:27:45	00:27:48	She looks pretty upset.
476	00:27:48	00:27:49	I'd believe her.
477	00:27:49	00:27:51	But this does not clear her of Barlow's murder.
478	00:27:51	00:27:54	If anything, it gives her a stronger motive.
479	00:27:54	00:27:56	Well, she already hated the guy.
480	00:27:56	00:27:58	This might have pushed her over the edge.
481	00:27:58	00:28:00	Let's look for evidence, see if we're right.
482	00:28:02	00:28:04	Whoa, hang on a sec. Yeah.
483	00:28:04	00:28:09	That's Barlow's roommate Curtis LeBlanc, just minutes after Michelle left the room.
484	00:28:09	00:28:10	But she said he wasn't in the room that night.
485	00:28:10	00:28:12	Michelle was drugged.
486	00:28:12	00:28:17	Curtis could have raped her while she was unconscious, then been in the bathroom while Derek had his turn.
487	00:28:17	00:28:19	These guys are worse than we thought.
488	00:28:21	00:28:24	So, this one is called Tropical Desire.
489	00:28:24	00:28:30	Yellow butter cake with Meyer lemon curd and key lime mouse-- mousse.
490	00:28:31	00:28:34	Hmm... it's tart.
491	00:28:34	00:28:38	I thought it was light and refreshing, not so sweet.
492	00:28:38	00:28:42	Well, I mean, if-if you like it, then we should go with that one.
493	00:28:42	00:28:44	We both need to like it.
494	00:28:44	00:28:47	The wedding cake is like il simbolo del nostro amore.
495	00:28:47	00:28:54	In Italy, when the bride and the groom feed each other cake, it tells the world that they will take care each other forever.
496	00:28:54	00:28:57	Can't we tell the world with a flan?
497	00:28:57	00:29:00	'Cause I'm-I'm not a big cake guy.
498	00:29:00	00:29:01	Wow, those look amazing.
499	00:29:01	00:29:03	You want to help us sample some?
500	00:29:03	00:29:06	We're trying to make a decision.
501	00:29:06	00:29:09	Oh, no, no, that's something that only you two can choose.
502	00:29:09	00:29:13	So, Elisabetta, is your family coming over for the wedding?
503	00:29:13	00:29:14	Of course.
504	00:29:14	00:29:19	My parents, brothers, few of my cousins, la mia nonna.
505	00:29:19	00:29:20	She has a big family.
506	00:29:20	00:29:22	Oh, must be hard to be so far away from them.
507	00:29:22	00:29:23	Ah, yeah.
508	00:29:23	00:29:29	I miss them so much, but no, living here-- it's not forever, solo temporanea.
509	00:29:29	00:29:31	Temporary?
510	00:29:31	00:29:33	Uh, uh, what do you mean?
511	00:29:33	00:29:38	Of course we will have babies and we move back to Italy.
512	00:29:38	00:29:41	Honey, I-I thought you liked it here.
513	00:29:41	00:29:45	Las Vegas is an amazing city, but it's no place to raise a family.
514	00:29:45	00:29:47	Yeah, but listen.
515	00:29:47	00:29:49	I-I've built a career here.
516	00:29:49	00:29:50	It's just a job, David.
517	00:29:50	00:29:54	My father said you can work at the vineyard with my brothers.
518	00:29:55	00:29:58	I'm a highly trained scientist.
519	00:29:58	00:30:04	I have helped put serial killers behind bars, and y-you want me to go stomp grapes for a living?
520	00:30:04	00:30:06	La Dolce Vita is not about work.
521	00:30:09	00:30:11	I'm sorry, we shouldn't argue in front of you.
522	00:30:11	00:30:16	It's okay, a couple needs to iron out these details before they go down the aisle.
523	00:30:16	00:30:19	I wish I had done that with my first husband.
524	00:30:19	00:30:23	When we first got together, it was very romantic-- very much like you two.
525	00:30:23	00:30:25	Where did you guys meet?
526	00:30:25	00:30:28	We met at a forensics seminar.
527	00:30:28	00:30:33	Ended up ditching, spent the whole week together, and then, a month later, we got engaged.
528	00:30:33	00:30:38	And then, uh, we got married and real life set in, and...
529	00:30:38	00:30:46	as much as we loved each other, we were still very, very different people with different goals and different needs and...
530	00:30:47	00:30:49	Just wasn't meant to be.
531	00:30:52	00:30:56	I'm thinking, uh, white chocolate raspberry symphony.
532	00:30:56	00:30:58	Anybody else?
533	00:31:04	00:31:12	I'm sorry to have to tell you that, in light of the ongoing investigation, legal has decided to shut us down for the remainder of the season.
534	00:31:12	00:31:19	I'm sorry, you have been an exceptional crew, and you will all be paid for the next two weeks.
535	00:31:19	00:31:24	In the meantime, uh, let's strike the sets and get rid of all the perishables.
536	00:31:25	00:31:27	I'm so sorry.
537	00:31:30	00:31:32	Excuse me.
538	00:31:32	00:31:33	Excuse me, excuse me.
539	00:31:33	00:31:35	What's going on?
540	00:31:35	00:31:37	Who is it?
541	00:31:41	00:31:43	Blunt force trauma to the head.
542	00:31:43	00:31:47	Makes Curtis LeBlanc the second chef murdered this week.
543	00:31:47	00:31:49	Killer competition.
544	00:31:58	00:32:00	Smells like soda.
545	00:32:00	00:32:01	There's some trace in this wound.
546	00:32:01	00:32:03	Looks like paper.
547	00:32:04	00:32:06	Maybe from that label.
548	00:32:06	00:32:09	Blood, bits of flesh.
549	00:32:09	00:32:11	Yeah, this could be our murder weapon.
550	00:32:11	00:32:17	You know, Russell and I found evidence that LeBlanc was in the room when Michelle Rowlands was raped.
551	00:32:17	00:32:21	Yeah, but she never implicated him, just Derek Barlow.
552	00:32:21	00:32:24	Maybe because she wanted to take care of him herself.
553	00:32:34	00:32:36	Two men involved with the rape.
554	00:32:36	00:32:37	Now they're both dead.
555	00:32:37	00:32:39	Serving up her own justice.
556	00:32:44	00:32:46	So, I checked VICAP.
557	00:32:46	00:32:49	You know, Michelle Rowlands' rape was very well planned.
558	00:32:49	00:32:55	two men, date rape drug and a trace of licorice.
559	00:32:55	00:32:57	And I got nothing.
560	00:32:57	00:33:02	Pretty unusual combination. But then I thought there has to be other things that taste like licorice, right?
561	00:33:02	00:33:03	Like-like fennel.
562	00:33:03	00:33:04	Ouzo.
563	00:33:04	00:33:05	And anise.
564	00:33:05	00:33:08	And then... I got this hit.
565	00:33:08	00:33:10	Unsolved case from over 15 years ago.
566	00:33:10	00:33:17	College freshman named Sally Lennon was raped and murdered at a Brassard University music festival.
567	00:33:17	00:33:20	Traces of GHB and anise extract.
568	00:33:20	00:33:24	Barlow and LeBlanc went to the very same college.
569	00:33:24	00:33:30	And when LeBlanc was arrested for drug-dealing, they found his GHB in anise extract bottles.
570	00:33:30	00:33:33	Says here two unidentified semen donors entered into CODIS.
571	00:33:33	00:33:35	Did you run that against Barlow and LeBlanc?
572	00:33:35	00:33:37	I did. And?
573	00:33:37	00:33:39	They matched.
574	00:33:39	00:33:42	So these two guys have raped before.
575	00:33:42	00:33:45	C.O.D. was asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.
576	00:33:45	00:33:49	And Sally's body was found scavenged by animals.
577	00:33:49	00:33:53	Based on this old case, Michelle Rowlands is very lucky to be alive.
578	00:33:53	00:33:55	Hey, Doc.
579	00:33:55	00:33:58	Got a C.O.D. on Mr. LeBlanc?
580	00:33:58	00:34:00	Not blunt force trauma.
581	00:34:00	00:34:03	Take a look at the esophagus here.
582	00:34:03	00:34:04	You see this swelling?
583	00:34:04	00:34:06	It's laryngeal edema.
584	00:34:06	00:34:08	There's also evidence of eosinophilia in the lungs.
585	00:34:09	00:34:11	Anaphylaxis.
586	00:34:11	00:34:14	According to his medical records, he had a severe almond allergy.
587	00:34:14	00:34:20	Even trace amounts would've caused his throat to swell shut, resulting in asphyxiation.
588	00:34:20	00:34:24	But we know that he was hit in the head with a frozen leg of lamb.
589	00:34:24	00:34:26	Maybe, maybe not.
590	00:34:26	00:34:34	It's possible that when Mr. LeBlanc started losing consciousness from the anaphylaxis, he fell, hitting his head on the leg of lamb.
591	00:34:34	00:34:37	He had to have known that he was deathly allergic to almonds.
592	00:34:37	00:34:38	How did they get in his system?
593	00:34:38	00:34:41	I didn't notice any needle marks or almonds in the stomach contents.
594	00:34:41	00:34:42	Only soda.
595	00:34:44	00:34:48	Morgan collected a drinking cup from the crime scene.
596	00:34:52	00:34:54	Hey-o.
597	00:34:54	00:34:59	So, uh, I found trace amounts of amygdalin and benzaldehyde in the soda.
598	00:34:59	00:35:01	Almond extract.
599	00:35:01	00:35:05	Every single person on that show knew about LeBlanc's allergy, including Michelle Rowlands.
600	00:35:05	00:35:08	Greg's analyzing the cup now.
601	00:35:08	00:35:10	Maybe he can find out who tampered with it.
602	00:35:10	00:35:11	Let's hope. Yeah.
603	00:35:11	00:35:13	Thanks. Mmm.
604	00:35:13	00:35:16	Hey, um... do you have a second?
605	00:35:16	00:35:18	Of course.
606	00:35:21	00:35:23	Do you...
607	00:35:23	00:35:27	think that I'm making a huge mistake by marrying Elisabetta?
608	00:35:29	00:35:31	Uh...
609	00:35:31	00:35:33	I can't tell you what to do.
610	00:35:35	00:35:43	But I can tell you that, whatever you decide, I'm gonna be here for you.
611	00:35:46	00:35:48	Uh, um...
612	00:35:48	00:35:50	I should get back to work.
613	00:35:57	00:35:59	So, um...
614	00:35:59	00:36:02	I went to this wedding last year.
615	00:36:02	00:36:05	They wrote their own vows, which was kind of funny.
616	00:36:05	00:36:09	But the groom...
617	00:36:09	00:36:12	he said something that just...
618	00:36:12	00:36:16	man, it stuck with me.
619	00:36:16	00:36:21	Never marry the one that you think you can live with.
620	00:36:23	00:36:27	Marry the one you know you can't live without.
621	00:36:32	00:36:36	I figured out the source of the almond extract that killed Curtis LeBlanc.
622	00:36:36	00:36:38	It wasn't his drink.
623	00:36:38	00:36:39	It was his straw.
624	00:36:39	00:36:48	Hidden inside was a sugar straw laced with almond extract, made precisely to fit inside Curtis LeBlanc's straw.
625	00:36:48	00:36:51	He would have never noticed it.
626	00:36:51	00:37:00	So when he took a sip of the soda, it passed through the sugar straw, picking up trace amounts of almond extract, which then entered into his system.
627	00:37:00	00:37:02	His throat swelled up.
628	00:37:02	00:37:03	Good night, Curtis.
629	00:37:03	00:37:10	when rolling sugar, no matter how careful you are, it's hard not to leave an impression.
630	00:37:10	00:37:12	Tell me you got a print.
631	00:37:12	00:37:14	Better than that, I got a match.
632	00:37:14	00:37:19	Ms. Bradley, as a producer, I assumed you worked your way up the ranks in television, but...
633	00:37:19	00:37:22	as it turns out, you're a classically trained chef.
634	00:37:22	00:37:25	I took courses at the Culinary Institute of America.
635	00:37:25	00:37:29	Ah, so you learned, uh, all about cooking, you know, from butchering to baking.
636	00:37:29	00:37:43	Yeah, I've always been fascinated with how chefs can make almost anything out of sugar, from a sculpture of a fire-breathing dragon to something as simple as a straw laced with almond extract.
637	00:37:43	00:37:47	This is the straw that killed Curtis LeBlanc.
638	00:37:47	00:37:49	And that's your print. We know you murdered LeBlanc.
639	00:37:49	00:37:52	We're pretty sure you murdered Derek Barlow, too.
640	00:37:52	00:38:08	What we didn't know was why until we started digging into your background and found out that your maiden name was Lennon. Same last name as a young girl who was raped and murdered 15 years ago-- Sally Lennon, your little sister.
641	00:38:08	00:38:10	And the case was never solved.
642	00:38:14	00:38:17	When they found her, she was wearing my favorite sweater.
643	00:38:17	00:38:19	She was always taking my stuff.
644	00:38:19	00:38:21	It's the only thing we ever fought about.
645	00:38:23	00:38:26	The case went cold.
646	00:38:26	00:38:27	My parents shut down.
647	00:38:27	00:38:31	They... they couldn't even mention her name.
648	00:38:31	00:38:36	Must have helped that your college buddies, Derek and Curtis, were there for you.
649	00:38:36	00:38:37	You've been friends with them ever since.
650	00:38:37	00:38:42	When you found out what they did to your sister, you arranged to get them on the show.
651	00:38:42	00:38:46	You wanted them on your turf so that you could kill them.
652	00:38:46	00:38:48	No.
653	00:38:48	00:38:50	I only found out three days ago.
654	00:38:50	00:38:58	I was going through raw footage, and saw Michelle coming out of Derek and Curtis's room, half naked, crying.
655	00:38:58	00:39:00	She told me about the rape.
656	00:39:00	00:39:03	She'd been drugged, tasted anise.
657	00:39:04	00:39:07	Derek's hand was around her throat.
658	00:39:07	00:39:11	Sounded just like what happened to Sally.
659	00:39:11	00:39:12	So then you confronted Derek.
660	00:39:12	00:39:18	Oh... You and Curtis raped my sister, strangled her, then dumped her in the woods like a piece of trash.
661	00:39:18	00:39:21	Nadine, Nadine. You pretended to be my friend. You...
662	00:39:21	00:39:23	You knew how hard it was for me all these years. I know, I know.
663	00:39:23	00:39:25	No, no, no. No! And the whole time, it was you!
664	00:39:34	00:39:38	I get why you wanted Derek Barlow dead, but you didn't just kill him.
665	00:39:38	00:39:42	You carved him up, you cooked him.
666	00:39:42	00:39:45	You served him to people.
667	00:39:45	00:39:49	My sister was ripped apart and eaten by animals.
668	00:39:51	00:39:55	My parents couldn't bring themselves to identify the body, so I had to do it.
669	00:39:55	00:39:59	I have had that image in my head every day for 15 years.
670	00:40:01	00:40:04	Derek deserved everything he got.
671	00:40:04	00:40:12	And you wanted to do the same thing to Curtis, but there were cops everywhere, so you had to make his death look like an accident.
672	00:40:12	00:40:15	I made them pay for what they did.
673	00:40:17	00:40:20	And I finally got justice for my sister.
674	00:40:33	00:40:36	Funny thing about Italian ice.
675	00:40:36	00:40:40	Some scholars believe that it wasn't invented in Italy.
676	00:40:40	00:40:43	That it was actually created in China.
677	00:40:47	00:40:48	David... Elisabetta...
678	00:40:48	00:40:49	Uh... Uh, sorry. You go first.
679	00:40:49	00:40:51	No, no, you go first.
680	00:40:53	00:40:55	I've been wanting to talk to you about something.
681	00:40:55	00:40:57	And I don't...
682	00:40:57	00:41:03	know how to say this, but, um, lately, I... I've been feeling that...
683	00:41:03	00:41:05	David, it's okay.
684	00:41:05	00:41:07	I know.
685	00:41:07	00:41:09	I've been feeling the same.
686	00:41:09	00:41:14	You and I-- we're very different people.
687	00:41:14	00:41:17	We both like different things.
688	00:41:17	00:41:21	You're not happy here.
689	00:41:21	00:41:23	You'll not be happy in Italy, either.
690	00:41:23	00:41:28	You'll miss your friends, you'll miss your work.
691	00:41:28	00:41:32	(sighs) And if we were truly meant to be together...
692	00:41:35	00:41:37	That wouldn't matter.
693	00:41:37	00:41:40	Unfortunately, it does.
694	00:41:44	00:41:47	I need to go now.
695	00:41:53	00:41:55	Yeah.
696	00:42:00	00:42:02	I will always love you.
697	00:42:02	00:42:04	Ti amo.
698	00:42:15	00:42:17	Ciao, David.
699	00:42:17	00:42:19	I'm sorry.
