1,00:00:05,00:00:12,"The city remains in mourning, as we try to make sense of the murder of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca."
2,00:00:12,00:00:19,"After his only son was gunned down by a drug dealer, Zamesca dedicated his life to public service."
3,00:00:19,00:00:22,He set his sights on the drug traffickers and the drug suppliers.
4,00:00:22,00:00:29,He believed you get drugs off the streets by putting the suppliers out of business.
5,00:00:29,00:00:31,That was his mission.
6,00:00:31,00:00:38,"His murder's rocked headlines, uniting Democrats and Republicans alike, all of us asking the same question: (camera shutter clicking)"
7,00:00:38,00:00:41,What happened out there?
8,00:00:41,00:00:43,"Peg from Sunrise Manor, you're on."
9,00:00:43,00:00:46,PEG: Danilo Zamesca spoke truth to power and got killed for it.
10,00:00:46,00:00:48,(camera shutter clicking)
11,00:00:48,00:00:52,I don't think there's anybody out there who has the courage to stand up and take his place.
12,00:00:54,00:00:56,(camera shutter clicking)
13,00:00:56,00:00:57,HOST: Roger from MacDonald Ranch.
14,00:00:57,00:01:03,"ROGER: If this guy was pure as the driven snow, what's he doing out in the middle of nowhere with drugs in his car?"
15,00:01:03,00:01:05,Give me a break.
16,00:01:05,00:01:07,"He was dirty, just like the rest of them."
17,00:01:07,00:01:08,"HOST: Okay, Roger, thank you for calling."
18,00:01:09,00:01:11,"Manuel from Henderson, what do you have to say?"
19,00:01:11,00:01:13,"MANUEL: The whole system is corrupt, man."
20,00:01:13,00:01:16,"In the next election, we need a new broom that sweeps clean."
21,00:01:16,00:01:18,(camera clicking)
22,00:01:25,00:01:27,Looks like some sort of foam.
23,00:01:27,00:01:29,Found it next to the tire impression.
24,00:02:19,00:02:20,(computer beeping)
25,00:02:21,00:02:24,BRASS: So CSI got a fingerprint off the drinking straw we found at the scene.
26,00:02:24,00:02:27,Guys like Thomas Simon never get their hands dirty.
27,00:02:27,00:02:29,No. It was a very clean print.
28,00:02:29,00:02:33,And Ballistics matched some shell casings that we found at Simon's McMansion on that raid last year.
29,00:02:33,00:02:34,Did you find the gun?
30,00:02:34,00:02:38,"No. So Zamesca was trying to put Simon out of business, and it cost him his life."
31,00:02:38,00:02:40,(rock music playing)
32,00:03:08,00:03:09,Hey.
33,00:03:09,00:03:11,I have a warrant for Thomas Simon.
34,00:03:11,00:03:12,Is he here?
35,00:03:12,00:03:13,"He's the owner, man."
36,00:03:13,00:03:16,"But even I haven't seen him in, like, three weeks."
37,00:03:16,00:03:18,Sorry.
38,00:03:22,00:03:28,"McKEEN: The biggest drug supplier on the West Coast kills a public official, and we can't find him."
39,00:03:28,00:03:29,I'm just the undersheriff.
40,00:03:29,00:03:33,I have one job: make the sheriff look smart.
41,00:03:33,00:03:34,You're not helping.
42,00:03:34,00:03:36,BRASS: We busted our hump trying to find this guy.
43,00:03:37,00:03:38,Science can only do so much with a cold trail.
44,00:03:39,00:03:41,You ever seen a man's face change into that kind of a demon?
45,00:03:41,00:03:43,My eggs are runny.
46,00:03:43,00:03:48,I couldn't have been more specific with the waitress.
47,00:03:48,00:03:49,You gonna eat those?
48,00:03:49,00:03:51,"Oh, you want my pancakes?"
49,00:03:51,00:03:52,"Yeah, sure, knock yourself out."
50,00:03:52,00:03:54,Here.
51,00:03:54,00:03:57,Thank you.
52,00:03:57,00:04:00,I don't hear a solution.
53,00:04:02,00:04:05,We could try something I did in Philly.
54,00:04:05,00:04:08,"It's, um, a little unorthodox."
55,00:04:08,00:04:10,I only want to know if it works.
56,00:04:10,00:04:11,"Philly, yes."
57,00:04:11,00:04:13,"Baltimore, no."
58,00:04:13,00:04:14,Is that why you're in Vegas?
59,00:04:17,00:04:19,Fifty-fifty. I can live with those odds.
60,00:04:19,00:04:20,"So, are you waiting for a drumroll?"
61,00:04:21,00:04:23,"It's called ""reverse forensics."" WILLOWS: Oh."
62,00:04:23,00:04:25,We fake a crime scene.
63,00:04:25,00:04:27,Basically.
64,00:04:27,00:04:28,How do we get around entrapment?
65,00:04:28,00:04:31,"Well, it's not entrapment if you're not enticing anyone to commit a crime."
66,00:04:31,00:04:34,The goal is to make Simon think he's off the hook.
67,00:04:34,00:04:35,So what's the catch?
68,00:04:35,00:04:37,Whole thing's a catch.
69,00:04:37,00:04:40,The hardest part is stopping leaks.
70,00:04:40,00:04:43,You've got to be willing to deceive the people you work with.
71,00:04:44,00:04:47,"Assuming they can be deceived, which they can't."
72,00:04:47,00:04:48,Not your call.
73,00:04:50,00:04:53,"You know, I can think of nine, no, ten ways that this could screw up."
74,00:04:53,00:04:55,At least.
75,00:04:55,00:04:57,So don't screw it up.
76,00:04:58,00:05:01,"The first thing we need is a victim, somebody we own."
77,00:05:01,00:05:05,"And you need a fall guy to play the role of ""killer,"" somebody who's jake with having his mug shot everywhere."
78,00:05:05,00:05:08,"In Baltimore, we used a snitch."
79,00:05:08,00:05:10,So you're going to have to bring the D.A. into this.
80,00:05:10,00:05:11,(scoffs)
81,00:05:11,00:05:14,The D.A.?
82,00:05:14,00:05:16,That bitch won't like it.
83,00:05:16,00:05:18,Thanks for breakfast.
84,00:05:18,00:05:20,(scoffs)
85,00:05:22,00:05:26,"You ever notice how it's the, uh, guys with all the money that never pay? Sure, that's how they keep all the money."
86,00:05:26,00:05:27,"Here, let me get it."
87,00:05:27,00:05:29,"No, I got it. New guy."
88,00:05:30,00:05:31,Thank you.
89,00:05:31,00:05:36,"You know, Catherine, if we do our job right and catch the bad guy, nobody's going to remember the rest."
90,00:05:37,00:05:39,I'll remember.
91,00:06:15,00:06:17,"Hey, Mike."
92,00:06:19,00:06:23,"Do you guys, uh, organize your files by case number?"
93,00:06:23,00:06:25,In a perfect world.
94,00:06:25,00:06:27,"We hired this, uh, knucklehead named Mahoney."
95,00:06:27,00:06:30,He had this dyslexic filing system.
96,00:06:30,00:06:32,So what do you think?
97,00:06:32,00:06:36,Does the dyslexic atheist not believe in dog?
98,00:06:36,00:06:37,What?
99,00:06:40,00:06:43,Oh... I get it.
100,00:06:48,00:06:49,Hey.
101,00:06:49,00:06:50,I need you on a 411 tonight.
102,00:06:50,00:06:52,Stolen motor vehicles?
103,00:06:53,00:06:54,You got to be kidding me.
104,00:06:54,00:06:55,P.D. recovered 20 stolen motorcycles.
105,00:06:55,00:06:57,They're at the Dupont Towing Lot.
106,00:06:57,00:06:58,"Can't you slide it to Days? BROWN: Hey, guys."
107,00:07:00,00:07:01,Take Warrick with you.
108,00:07:01,00:07:03,It'll go faster.
109,00:07:03,00:07:04,Okay. What'll go faster?
110,00:07:05,00:07:07,Giddyup.
111,00:07:09,00:07:11,(meows)
112,00:07:18,00:07:20,"What's happening, Rat?"
113,00:07:20,00:07:22,"Boy, you got to love junkies, huh?"
114,00:07:22,00:07:24,"What stamina, what willpower."
115,00:07:24,00:07:26,"I mean, even the rain doesn't keep them away."
116,00:07:26,00:07:29,"It doesn't keep the cops away either, I guess, huh?"
117,00:07:29,00:07:31,"You nervous, Rat? Relax, relax, I'm just here to talk."
118,00:07:31,00:07:33,"Listen, you like game shows?"
119,00:07:33,00:07:35,Because I got a deal; listen to this.
120,00:07:35,00:07:39,First place is a life-changing experience.
121,00:07:39,00:07:40,You get a whole new life.
122,00:07:40,00:07:42,What's second place?
123,00:07:42,00:07:44,"There is no second place, Rat."
124,00:07:44,00:07:46,"Either way, you don't get to work the alley anymore."
125,00:07:46,00:07:47,Screw you.
126,00:07:47,00:07:48,Screw me?
127,00:07:48,00:07:50,"No, no."
128,00:07:50,00:07:52,"Screw you. Look, take my deal."
129,00:07:52,00:08:01,"Otherwise, you're in possession of a controlled substance, and with your record, that's a mandatory sentence. Okay."
130,00:08:01,00:08:02,"If you want information, just ask me."
131,00:08:02,00:08:03,Just that I'm...
132,00:08:03,00:08:06,"All right, let's walk, walk with me."
133,00:08:06,00:08:07,It's a little complicated.
134,00:08:07,00:08:08,You own a gun?
135,00:08:09,00:08:11,"That's K-E-P-P-L-E-R, Michael Keppler."
136,00:08:11,00:08:12,"Yeah, check it out."
137,00:08:12,00:08:13,"Okay, I got to go."
138,00:08:13,00:08:15,(hangs up phone)
139,00:08:17,00:08:20,What's going on?
140,00:08:21,00:08:23,"Um, nothing I can talk about."
141,00:08:23,00:08:25,Keep me posted on the 419.
142,00:08:25,00:08:27,Greg's going to meet you at the scene.
143,00:08:27,00:08:28,Okay.
144,00:08:32,00:08:35,"Ten to one, it's Internal Affairs."
145,00:08:35,00:08:37,Got a vibe off Keppler the minute he blew in.
146,00:08:37,00:08:39,Always with a suit.
147,00:08:40,00:08:43,"If you got any dirty laundry, I hope you used bleach."
148,00:09:12,00:09:14,(box cutter rattles)
149,00:09:37,00:09:39,(sighs)
150,00:09:46,00:09:48,(sighs)
151,00:09:48,00:09:50,(rings bell)
152,00:09:50,00:09:51,(coughs)
153,00:09:58,00:09:58,What?
154,00:09:59,00:10:01,"I'm CSI Stokes, this is Brown."
155,00:10:02,00:10:03,Where's your paperwork?
156,00:10:03,00:10:05,"We're from the crime lab, dude."
157,00:10:05,00:10:07,I still need paperwork.
158,00:10:07,00:10:10,"We're here to process those stolen motorcycles, man."
159,00:10:10,00:10:12,"I need authorization, fellas, in writing."
160,00:10:13,00:10:17,"Wh-What if, what if I promise to come back and give it to you later?"
161,00:10:18,00:10:19,"Okay, cut us some slack here, man."
162,00:10:19,00:10:21,You think we really feel like being down here?
163,00:10:21,00:10:23,How do you want to handle this?
164,00:10:24,00:10:25,You want to shoot our way in?
165,00:10:25,00:10:27,I'd love to bust a cap in his knee.
166,00:10:27,00:10:29,"Sir, don't make us call your supervisor."
167,00:10:29,00:10:30,"Now, come on. (bangs on door)"
168,00:10:30,00:10:31,Come on!
169,00:10:34,00:10:36,PHILLIPS: We got third instar maggots.
170,00:10:36,00:10:38,(exhales)
171,00:10:38,00:10:41,"With this smell, she's been dead at least 48 hours."
172,00:10:41,00:10:43,Toys are all here.
173,00:10:43,00:10:46,"Needle, syringe, tubing, candle, spoon."
174,00:10:48,00:10:50,It looks like heroin.
175,00:10:50,00:10:55,CURTIS: Manager said he found her like this when he came by for a visit.
176,00:10:55,00:10:59,"Said they were friends, but he was a little unclear of her name."
177,00:10:59,00:11:00,Monique something or other.
178,00:11:01,00:11:04,"Maybe she was, uh, working off the rent."
179,00:11:04,00:11:06,No I.D. on the body.
180,00:11:06,00:11:07,I'll take a look around for it.
181,00:11:11,00:11:13,Needle marks are sclerotic.
182,00:11:13,00:11:15,Chronic user. Probable O.D.
183,00:11:19,00:11:20,(camera shutter clicking)
184,00:11:20,00:11:21,SARA: Scorpio.
185,00:11:21,00:11:23,Ruled by Pluto.
186,00:11:23,00:11:26,Athough since it's not a planet anymore...
187,00:11:26,00:11:28,I'm not sure how that works.
188,00:11:28,00:11:29,"Maybe it's a ""dwarf"" sign."
189,00:11:29,00:11:32,"Like Pluto is, you know, a ""dwarf"" planet now."
190,00:11:35,00:11:37,Car keys.
191,00:11:37,00:11:39,Cell phone.
192,00:11:41,00:11:42,"No ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" listed."
193,00:11:44,00:11:45,There's a lot of food for a junkie.
194,00:11:45,00:11:48,SARA: Maybe she had a roommate.
195,00:11:48,00:11:51,Zamesca was shot three times with a nine millimeter.
196,00:11:51,00:11:54,We've got two sets of shoe impressions.
197,00:11:54,00:11:57,Two sets of tire impressions.
198,00:11:57,00:12:00,"A plastic ""Jumbo Cola"" cup."
199,00:12:00,00:12:05,"Drugs were found in Zamesca's car, in plain view, but his tox was negative."
200,00:12:05,00:12:07,Drugs were planted.
201,00:12:07,00:12:09,Crime scene was a remote location.
202,00:12:09,00:12:12,That's in our favor.
203,00:12:12,00:12:13,Car was a bloody mess.
204,00:12:16,00:12:19,"Our ""victim"" was kind enough to donate a pint of his blood."
205,00:12:19,00:12:24,Did Mr. Holstein also donate his brain matter and bone fragments?
206,00:12:24,00:12:27,"Brass recruited him from Narco, undercover cop."
207,00:12:27,00:12:29,Opted to keep his brains intact.
208,00:12:31,00:12:38,"Well, without actually shooting the guy, this scene is going to be slightly less than perfect, but it's just you and me out there. No, can't be."
209,00:12:38,00:12:43,We're going to need a third person processing the scene to make it look kosher-- someone who's not in on it.
210,00:12:43,00:12:46,"Well, if we use one of my guys, they're going to figure it out."
211,00:12:47,00:12:49,Keep them away from the car.
212,00:12:52,00:12:55,I'm not used to faking it.
213,00:12:56,00:12:58,When's the last time you had to?
214,00:13:25,00:13:27,Registration's expired.
215,00:13:27,00:13:30,Want to bet she's not insured?
216,00:13:30,00:13:34,"Monique Carter. 155 North Court, Henderson."
217,00:13:34,00:13:36,"Oh, that's a good neighborhood."
218,00:13:36,00:13:38,"Well, this used to be a nice car."
219,00:13:38,00:13:41,"Maybe she traded in her old lifestyle to ride the ""H"" train."
220,00:13:41,00:13:43,"Now, the manager wants it out of here."
221,00:13:43,00:13:45,"So, I'll have it towed."
222,00:14:01,00:14:03,It looks like an impact from a weapon.
223,00:14:03,00:14:05,"Very good observation, David."
224,00:14:05,00:14:07,Shave the area. Call Sara.
225,00:14:07,00:14:09,We may be looking at a homicide.
226,00:14:49,00:14:51,"Hey, Henry. Hey."
227,00:14:51,00:14:54,It's heroin mixed with cocaine and methamphetamine.
228,00:14:54,00:15:00,I was just going to page you because these are the same components from the drugs you found in Zamesca's car.
229,00:15:00,00:15:02,Really? Should I call Sara? It's her case.
230,00:15:02,00:15:05,"Henry, I need you to step out and get a cup of coffee."
231,00:15:05,00:15:07,"Well, I can't leave my evidence out."
232,00:15:07,00:15:10,This is not a request.
233,00:15:37,00:15:39,Firing one.
234,00:15:39,00:15:40,(fires gun)
235,00:15:53,00:15:54,Is there a problem?
236,00:15:54,00:15:58,"F.Y.I., Bobby Dawson is a bit of a control freak."
237,00:15:58,00:16:00,Doesn't like anyone in here unsupervised.
238,00:16:00,00:16:04,So he got one accidental discharge on his record.
239,00:16:04,00:16:05,I'm sure he doesn't want another one.
240,00:16:05,00:16:08,Unless...
241,00:16:08,00:16:13,"of course, this is an I.A. investigation, and, uh, Bobby is his subject."
242,00:16:15,00:16:19,"Interesting that Grissom, champion of the little guys, is on sabbatical."
243,00:16:21,00:16:24,"Interesting, especially if he planned it that way."
244,00:16:50,00:16:53,"This is my own blood, right?"
245,00:16:54,00:16:56,'Cause it's starting to drip in my mouth.
246,00:16:56,00:16:58,It's all yours.
247,00:16:58,00:17:01,"You can get out now, Detective, and..."
248,00:17:01,00:17:04,"I know, don't touch anything. You got it."
249,00:17:04,00:17:07,"Oh, and there's some fresh clothes in the back of the vehicle."
250,00:17:07,00:17:09,"Got any brandy? Sorry, man."
251,00:17:14,00:17:19,"So, Mike, you said reverse forensics didn't work in Baltimore. How come?"
252,00:17:19,00:17:20,Smart cops.
253,00:17:24,00:17:26,You steal cars before you became a CSI?
254,00:17:27,00:17:29,Stealing cars gets old fast.
255,00:17:29,00:17:30,I like more of a challenge.
256,00:17:30,00:17:32,Note to self.
257,00:17:37,00:17:39,"Okay, you can drop that cup now."
258,00:17:39,00:17:40,"Yeah, I'm not done yet."
259,00:17:40,00:17:42,He said drop it.
260,00:17:42,00:17:46,"About my new identity, um, I don't want to go to Denver."
261,00:17:46,00:17:50,I think I'd rather go someplace where I'd fit in... like Maui.
262,00:17:50,00:17:53,"EZEKIEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
263,00:17:53,00:17:55,And I want a threesome with Beyonce and Scarlett Johansson.
264,00:17:55,00:17:58,Drop the cup and get your rat ass in the car.
265,00:17:59,00:18:01,I drop the cup.
266,00:18:11,00:18:13,Casual.
267,00:18:13,00:18:15,Excuse me? Simon.
268,00:18:15,00:18:18,His soda.
269,00:18:18,00:18:20,He wasn't expecting trouble.
270,00:18:20,00:18:22,KEPPLER: Get out of my car...
271,00:18:22,00:18:24,walk over to Zamesca.
272,00:18:24,00:18:26,Didn't come here to kill him...
273,00:18:26,00:18:27,came to talk.
274,00:18:27,00:18:29,Hand him the photo.
275,00:18:29,00:18:32,Then something doesn't go as planned.
276,00:18:35,00:18:36,I drop the drink...
277,00:18:37,00:18:39,grab my gun.
278,00:18:42,00:18:43,Murder was Plan B.
279,00:18:43,00:18:45,Plan A was the photograph.
280,00:18:46,00:18:49,Anti-drug crusader doing lines.
281,00:18:49,00:18:50,Career buster.
282,00:18:50,00:18:52,Looks like he underestimated Zamesca.
283,00:18:52,00:18:54,He was a hard man to kill.
284,00:18:54,00:18:56,Simon panicked.
285,00:18:56,00:18:58,Which explains why he left evidence behind this time.
286,00:18:58,00:19:00,And why he had to disappear.
287,00:19:00,00:19:02,And why we're doing this.
288,00:19:09,00:19:11,I'm going to call it in.
289,00:19:17,00:19:19,"DISPATCHER: 911, is this an emergency?"
290,00:19:19,00:19:20,"Yes, someone's been shot."
291,00:19:20,00:19:23,I'm a quarter mile west of Mountain's Edge and Durango.
292,00:19:23,00:19:24,There's a man bleeding from the head in his car.
293,00:19:24,00:19:27,"Looks like a gunshot wound, but I didn't see a gun."
294,00:19:27,00:19:28,He's dead for sure.
295,00:19:28,00:19:30,"Sir, may I have your name? (phone beeps off)"
296,00:19:33,00:19:38,"CONTROL: 419, possible 420, quarter mile west of Mountain's Edge and Durango."
297,00:19:38,00:19:41,"Possible man down, gunshot wound to the head."
298,00:19:42,00:19:44,"2-0cean-2, 2-0cean-34, please respond."
299,00:19:44,00:19:46,Show time.
300,00:19:46,00:19:48,"Control, this is 2-Zero-3, Charlie-Captain-Brass."
301,00:19:48,00:19:51,I am with Charlie-Zero-4-Willows and Charlie-Zero-9-Keppler.
302,00:19:51,00:19:53,We're around the corner.
303,00:19:53,00:19:56,Our E.T.A. is five minutes. We'll be responding also.
304,00:19:56,00:20:00,DR. ROBBINS: C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the right temporal region.
305,00:20:00,00:20:03,(phone rings) Wound's inconsistent with a fall.
306,00:20:03,00:20:07,"(phone ringing) You fall into something, say a coffee table, wound's always deeper on one end."
307,00:20:07,00:20:09,(phone ringing) Depth here is uniform.
308,00:20:09,00:20:14,(yelling): Would somone please answer that phone?
309,00:20:14,00:20:19,"Sorry. Tox confirms high level of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine in her system."
310,00:20:19,00:20:25,"I opened up her arm under a fresh needle mark, drew out one milliliter of dark liquid."
311,00:20:25,00:20:26,The drugs were puddled.
312,00:20:26,00:20:30,Means they didn't circulate in her bloodstream.
313,00:20:30,00:20:31,Injection was postmortem.
314,00:20:31,00:20:33,Dead girls don't shoot up.
315,00:20:33,00:20:35,PHILLIPS: Sorry.
316,00:20:35,00:20:37,Catherine needs to speak to you. Says it's urgent.
317,00:20:37,00:20:38,Right.
318,00:20:39,00:20:41,"ROBBINS: I'm in the middle of an autopsy, Catherine."
319,00:20:41,00:20:43,Sorry. I'm at a 420.
320,00:20:43,00:20:46,Similar M.O.to Zamesca. Press is all over us.
321,00:20:46,00:20:48,I need permission to get the body out of here ASAP.
322,00:20:48,00:20:51,That's fine. Just photograph and diagram it before transporting.
323,00:20:51,00:20:54,"Of course. Now, which mortuary's on call?"
324,00:20:54,00:20:56,Kentworth. You have that number?
325,00:20:56,00:20:58,"I'll take care of it. Thanks, Doc."
326,00:20:58,00:21:01,NICK: This is so lame.
327,00:21:01,00:21:06,How much do you want to bet half the prints come back to the cops who recovered these bikes. They never wear gloves.
328,00:21:06,00:21:08,Brown.
329,00:21:08,00:21:11,"Hey, Cath."
330,00:21:11,00:21:12,We'll see you there.
331,00:21:12,00:21:15,"Well, in that case..."
332,00:21:15,00:21:16,I'll see you there.
333,00:21:16,00:21:20,"Boy, she has got it in for me today."
334,00:21:20,00:21:22,"Well, giddyup."
335,00:21:22,00:21:24,(laughs)
336,00:21:31,00:21:34,WARRICK: CSI coming through.
337,00:21:34,00:21:36,Thank you.
338,00:21:48,00:21:51,Where's the body? Called the morticians to get it out of here.
339,00:21:51,00:21:52,Gunshot victim.
340,00:21:52,00:21:54,Got I.D.?
341,00:21:54,00:21:56,Ezekiel Holstein.
342,00:21:56,00:21:57,Local.
343,00:21:57,00:21:59,Brass is running him now.
344,00:22:01,00:22:03,"Hey, Cath, didn't you find Zamesca near here?"
345,00:22:03,00:22:05,Yeah.
346,00:22:05,00:22:06,"Got the ""Jumbo"" cup."
347,00:22:06,00:22:09,Shoe and tire impressions.
348,00:22:09,00:22:10,Shot in his car.
349,00:22:10,00:22:12,Think Simon's coming out of hiding?
350,00:22:13,00:22:14,Or it's a copycat.
351,00:22:14,00:22:17,Want me to take the backseat?
352,00:22:17,00:22:21,"No, um, take the perimeter, get started on a diagram."
353,00:22:21,00:22:22,"Okay, Sarge."
354,00:22:22,00:22:24,Not my first barbecue.
355,00:22:24,00:22:28,"Thanks, Warrick. REPORTER: Undersheriff McKeen, is this related to the Zamesca murder?"
356,00:22:28,00:22:32,"We're in the process of conducting an investigation, so I don't have all the facts."
357,00:22:32,00:22:35,But there does appear to be some similarities to Assemblyman Zamesca's murder.
358,00:22:35,00:22:38,"UNDERSHERIFF MCKEEN: Uh, I have no further comments at this time."
359,00:22:39,00:22:40,BRASS: Ezekiel Holstein.
360,00:22:40,00:22:43,Date of birth: 07-14-72.
361,00:22:43,00:22:45,Do a records check.
362,00:22:45,00:22:48,"Oh, and, uh, contact Narco."
363,00:22:48,00:22:50,May be drug-related.
364,00:22:51,00:22:53,I really feel good about this.
365,00:22:59,00:23:03,APARTMENT MANAGER: Monique's dead body means I got to get the carpet cleaned.
366,00:23:03,00:23:07,"You said the scene was clear, I called the cleaning service."
367,00:23:07,00:23:08,It's a good way to cover your tracks.
368,00:23:08,00:23:12,"Like I said, she'd been shacked up with some guy."
369,00:23:12,00:23:13,Can you describe him?
370,00:23:13,00:23:18,"Average-looking, white dude."
371,00:23:18,00:23:20,I only saw him from a distance.
372,00:23:20,00:23:21,He was driving her car.
373,00:23:21,00:23:27,"Look, she was a nice, smart lady."
374,00:23:27,00:23:30,She helped me get out of a jam with my insurance company.
375,00:23:30,00:23:37,"I know she liked the ""candy"", but she did not deserve to go out that way."
376,00:23:37,00:23:40,SANDERS: I ran Monique Carter's phone records.
377,00:23:40,00:23:43,Someone made a dozen calls from her cell yesterday.
378,00:23:43,00:23:44,She was dead yesterday.
379,00:23:44,00:23:49,"Yeah, and we recovered her phone from her apartment, so someone was yakking while she was lying dead on the floor dead."
380,00:23:49,00:23:51,Let's run those numbers.
381,00:23:59,00:24:01,"HODGES: Hey, how's the King of property crimes?"
382,00:24:01,00:24:04,My socks keep disappearing in the dryer.
383,00:24:04,00:24:05,You want to tackle that one?
384,00:24:05,00:24:07,What are you doing with the cup from my Zamesca scene?
385,00:24:07,00:24:08,That's not your cup.
386,00:24:09,00:24:11,It's from Catherine and Warrick's 420.
387,00:24:11,00:24:14,They found the same kind of cup at their scene?
388,00:24:14,00:24:15,Same everything.
389,00:24:15,00:24:16,Watch the news lately?
390,00:24:22,00:24:24,"Hey, what about my socks?"
391,00:24:24,00:24:26,They're not gonna find themselves.
392,00:24:44,00:24:46,"Uh, excuse me."
393,00:24:46,00:24:49,"Uh, what are you doing?"
394,00:24:49,00:24:52,"Hi, Mike Keppler."
395,00:24:52,00:24:57,"Sorry, didn't get a chance to introduce myself before I, uh, invaded your lab."
396,00:24:57,00:25:00,"Uh, well, can I help you with something?"
397,00:25:00,00:25:03,"Yeah, I'm looking for the ballistics on Holstein."
398,00:25:03,00:25:05,"Uh, yeah, just about to run them."
399,00:25:05,00:25:06,Great.
400,00:25:06,00:25:08,Mind if I sit in?
401,00:25:27,00:25:33,"Bullet that killed Holstein was a nine-mill, same caliber as Zamesca, but no match."
402,00:25:33,00:25:34,Killer could have used a different gun.
403,00:25:34,00:25:35,"Thanks, Bobby."
404,00:25:36,00:25:38,See you later.
405,00:25:41,00:25:43,"Hey, Doc. Hey, Nick."
406,00:25:43,00:25:45,Want you to catch me up with Catherine and Warrick.
407,00:25:45,00:25:47,I haven't seen them.
408,00:25:47,00:25:49,Where's the body from their 420?
409,00:25:49,00:25:50,"Uh, it hasn't come in yet."
410,00:25:50,00:25:51,It was a mortuary pickup.
411,00:25:51,00:25:53,Who's this?
412,00:25:53,00:25:55,It's Monique Carter.
413,00:25:55,00:25:57,"Heroin addict, got whacked on the head."
414,00:26:00,00:26:02,She involved with Catherine's 420?
415,00:26:02,00:26:05,"If she was, nobody told me."
416,00:26:07,00:26:09,Will you send me a photo of this tattoo?
417,00:26:09,00:26:11,"And when the body comes in at the mortuary, will you give me a call?"
418,00:26:11,00:26:13,I'll get right on it.
419,00:26:18,00:26:20,Seat's been pushed all the way back.
420,00:26:20,00:26:22,Manager said he saw a guy driving.
421,00:26:34,00:26:36,She was a lawyer.
422,00:26:36,00:26:41,Suspended for failure to pay her Bar Association dues.
423,00:26:41,00:26:44,"Lose all that to drugs, you gotta be in a lot of pain."
424,00:26:44,00:26:47,Or you think you're too smart to get addicted.
425,00:26:47,00:26:48,You guys seen Catherine around?
426,00:26:48,00:26:49,She's not answering her cell phone. Mm-mm.
427,00:26:49,00:26:53,Anything from your scene link back to Zamesca?
428,00:26:53,00:26:54,No. Why?
429,00:26:55,00:26:58,Because I think your d.b.'s the unidentified woman in the photo I found.
430,00:26:58,00:26:59,Really?
431,00:27:03,00:27:10,"And, excuse me, we found this same type of material at the Zamesca scene."
432,00:27:10,00:27:11,If we can match it back to this car...
433,00:27:11,00:27:13,You could place the car at the scene.
434,00:27:13,00:27:15,And Simon behind the wheel.
435,00:27:15,00:27:18,Got a partial print off the straw from the soda cup.
436,00:27:18,00:27:22,"AFIS hit Edwin Dennison, aka ""Rat""."
437,00:27:25,00:27:27,Small-time drug dealer with a big-time rap sheet.
438,00:27:27,00:27:29,"Well, I'll get Brass to bring him in, huh?"
439,00:27:29,00:27:31,Nice work.
440,00:27:33,00:27:36,I just connected Sara's vic to Simon.
441,00:27:38,00:27:41,"Yeah, you might want to hear this."
442,00:27:41,00:27:43,BROWN: What's the connection?
443,00:27:43,00:27:48,"Well, I think, that Simon was driving her BMW to meet Zamesca."
444,00:27:48,00:27:51,"Nick, we got a print from the Holstein case."
445,00:27:51,00:27:52,Street dealer.
446,00:27:52,00:27:53,We're bringing him in now.
447,00:27:53,00:27:56,"And he looks dirty for Zamesca, too."
448,00:27:56,00:27:58,Excuse me.
449,00:27:59,00:28:00,I grew up in this town.
450,00:28:01,00:28:02,I know about playing the odds.
451,00:28:02,00:28:03,You are gambling with my team.
452,00:28:03,00:28:06,We talked about the risk going in.
453,00:28:06,00:28:07,It's not like we can quit now.
454,00:28:07,00:28:08,I'm not quitting.
455,00:28:09,00:28:10,But I don't like it.
456,00:28:10,00:28:12,And I hate lying to my guys.
457,00:28:16,00:28:19,(reporters clamoring)
458,00:28:21,00:28:23,"REPORTER: Mr. Dennison, could we have a comment?"
459,00:28:30,00:28:32,Is this relating to the...
460,00:28:32,00:28:34,Good afternoon.
461,00:28:34,00:28:45,"The Las Vegas Police Department has successfully apprehended a suspect, one Edwin Dennison, who's confessed of multiple homicides, including that of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca."
462,00:28:45,00:28:53,"Mr. Dennison admitted to luring Mr. Zamesca to a remote location, while seeking his help to escape the drug trade."
463,00:28:53,00:28:58,"When Mr. Zamesca encouraged him to surrender to police, Mr. Dennison shot him."
464,00:28:58,00:29:02,He later shot Mr. Holstein during a dispute over a drug deal.
465,00:29:02,00:29:11,I'd like to say how very proud I am of the swift and efficient work done that my department has done in tracking down and apprehending this dangerous criminal...
466,00:29:20,00:29:23,You know that Dawson guy gets kind of uptight when people touch his stuff.
467,00:29:25,00:29:30,"Well, the Holstein scene bullet was fired from the same gun that you found in Rat's car."
468,00:29:32,00:29:33,(fires gun)
469,00:29:35,00:29:37,Done deal.
470,00:29:37,00:29:38,I'm not so sure.
471,00:29:38,00:29:41,If this bullet went through the window and a guy's head...
472,00:29:41,00:29:44,it would have pieces of glass and bits of bone in it.
473,00:29:49,00:29:51,This hollow point's clean.
474,00:29:51,00:29:52,There's no sand-blasted effect.
475,00:29:52,00:29:54,Hmm.
476,00:29:54,00:29:58,"The DNA sample yet, might have been cleaned already."
477,00:29:58,00:29:59,There's still blood on it.
478,00:29:59,00:30:02,I see your point.
479,00:30:04,00:30:06,Maybe autopsy will show something.
480,00:30:12,00:30:14,"Hey, Nick."
481,00:30:15,00:30:18,I can't find the evidence in the Holstein case.
482,00:30:18,00:30:20,What do you want it for?
483,00:30:20,00:30:24,Because that guy who confessed to killing Zamesca didn't do it.
484,00:30:24,00:30:25,Sheriff's jumping the gun.
485,00:30:25,00:30:27,We have evidence and a confession.
486,00:30:27,00:30:29,You can't just come in here and take over my case.
487,00:30:31,00:30:36,"Is there a reason you don't want me to see that file, Catherine?"
488,00:30:36,00:30:39,"Nick, as your supervisor, I'm ordering you to back off."
489,00:30:48,00:30:50,Thanks.
490,00:30:50,00:30:51,"Uh, it's freezing."
491,00:30:51,00:30:53,Why are we having a meeting outside?
492,00:30:53,00:30:55,'Cause Catherine and Keppler are in there.
493,00:30:55,00:30:57,"What, have you guys been listening to Hodges?"
494,00:30:57,00:31:00,"No, and this isn't about Keppler being I.A. anyway."
495,00:31:00,00:31:04,This is about Catherine having a false confession and standing by it.
496,00:31:04,00:31:06,"You'd better be able to back that one up, man."
497,00:31:06,00:31:08,Zamesca knew Sara and Greg's vic.
498,00:31:08,00:31:11,"He's dead, she's dead, same drugs are found at both scenes, and then..."
499,00:31:12,00:31:14,those same drugs showed up at your crime scene?
500,00:31:14,00:31:16,Could have come from the same supplier.
501,00:31:16,00:31:17,We see that all the time.
502,00:31:17,00:31:19,I don't think it's a coincidence.
503,00:31:19,00:31:22,"You know, Catherine..."
504,00:31:22,00:31:27,Catherine ordered Henry to step out of his lab without putting drug evidence away.
505,00:31:27,00:31:29,Why would she do that?
506,00:31:29,00:31:32,I did see Keppler checking out Zamesca's file yesterday.
507,00:31:32,00:31:36,"I didn't think anything strange about it then, but now... Okay, so..."
508,00:31:36,00:31:42,maybe there is an I.A. investigation I can't find the Holstein evidence.
509,00:31:42,00:31:43,What?
510,00:31:43,00:31:46,Catherine put it in a temporary locker.
511,00:31:46,00:31:48,Why didn't she put it where it belongs?
512,00:31:48,00:31:54,"The Holstein bullet was a little bit too clean, and Keppler didn't seem at all concerned about it."
513,00:31:54,00:31:57,He said that we would see at autopsy.
514,00:31:57,00:32:00,"Well, it's kind of hard to have an autopsy when you don't have a body, man."
515,00:32:00,00:32:03,"I talked to Doc Robbins, he's still trying to track it down."
516,00:32:03,00:32:07,And the mortuary has no record of Catherine's phone call whatsoever.
517,00:32:07,00:32:09,Do we have access to any of the Holstein evidence?
518,00:32:09,00:32:11,We got the car.
519,00:32:14,00:32:16,Catherine sent it to the impound.
520,00:32:16,00:32:18,"Well, at least we know where it is."
521,00:32:18,00:32:21,"All right, that's it, we're a team now, the four of us."
522,00:32:21,00:32:24,We can't trust Catherine and we can't trust Keppler.
523,00:32:24,00:32:25,I'm serious.
524,00:32:27,00:32:28,I'm gonna run with this one.
525,00:32:28,00:32:31,I'll run with you.
526,00:32:32,00:32:33,You?
527,00:32:37,00:32:38,I'm in.
528,00:32:52,00:32:54,"Hey. Hey, you!"
529,00:32:54,00:32:57,Try to stop me and I'll have you put in jail.
530,00:33:25,00:33:27,(objects rattling)
531,00:33:41,00:33:43,(phone dialing)
532,00:33:43,00:33:45,"Brown. Hey, Warrick, it's Nick."
533,00:33:45,00:33:50,When is the last time you found high-velocity exit spatter with no brain and no bone?
534,00:33:50,00:33:52,Never.
535,00:33:52,00:33:53,Got the evidence yet? (knocking)
536,00:33:53,00:33:54,You know what? Sara's here.
537,00:33:54,00:33:56,And she has the key.
538,00:33:56,00:33:58,Got to go.
539,00:33:58,00:34:04,"You know... I really hate deceiving people because, eventually, you get what you give."
540,00:34:05,00:34:07,I hate being deceived.
541,00:34:14,00:34:16,Yes.
542,00:34:18,00:34:19,All right. (slams box)
543,00:34:19,00:34:21,"Anything I collected, we ignore."
544,00:34:58,00:35:00,You running your own samples?
545,00:35:01,00:35:05,"Smart, considering that you're the odds-on favorite in the I.A. pool."
546,00:35:05,00:35:07,There's a pool now?
547,00:35:07,00:35:08,"Oh, yeah."
548,00:35:08,00:35:09,Who's number two?
549,00:35:09,00:35:10,That would be me.
550,00:35:10,00:35:11,Number three?
551,00:35:11,00:35:13,Grissom.
552,00:35:48,00:35:49,How's it going in here?
553,00:35:49,00:35:52,This glass wasn't shot out.
554,00:35:52,00:35:54,Take a look at that.
555,00:35:59,00:36:03,Spark plug? The only mark a spark plug makes is a nick at the center.
556,00:36:03,00:36:04,"Now, who would know about that?"
557,00:36:04,00:36:07,Crooks.
558,00:36:07,00:36:08,And cops.
559,00:36:08,00:36:09,"And, hey, get this."
560,00:36:09,00:36:12,The blood found in Holstein's car had high levels of EDTA.
561,00:36:12,00:36:15,Anti-coagulant.
562,00:36:15,00:36:17,Means the blood didn't come from his head; it came from his arm.
563,00:36:17,00:36:20,That means this crime scene was staged.
564,00:36:20,00:36:24,"Well, if KepplerisI.A., Catherine can't tell us anything if she wanted to."
565,00:36:24,00:36:28,"Yeah, if this is all I.A. BS, then why would they play it out in the press?"
566,00:36:28,00:36:29,I should talk to Brass.
567,00:36:30,00:36:31,Maybe he could shed some light.
568,00:36:43,00:36:46,(speaking inaudibly)
569,00:36:57,00:36:59,Let's roll.
570,00:36:59,00:37:02,(sirens blaring)
571,00:37:02,00:37:06,(up-tempo electronic music playing)
572,00:37:09,00:37:12,"OFFICER (over radio): I got a 20 on Simon, right here."
573,00:37:12,00:37:14,(gun cocks)
574,00:37:15,00:37:19,"BRASS: Thomas Simon, you're under arrest! You two-- step over there. (record scratches, music stops)"
575,00:37:19,00:37:21,"Is there a problem, Detective?"
576,00:37:21,00:37:22,A problem?
577,00:37:23,00:37:25,We're charging you with the murder of Danilo Zamesca.
578,00:37:25,00:37:28,You already got a guy for that murder.
579,00:37:28,00:37:30,I saw it on the news.
580,00:37:30,00:37:32,"Well, it's good to meet an informed citizen."
581,00:37:32,00:37:33,Nine-millimeter.
582,00:37:33,00:37:35,Get him out of here.
583,00:37:38,00:37:40,(indistinct chatter inside)
584,00:37:43,00:37:45,WOMAN: Even your own district attorney said she wasn't aware.
585,00:37:45,00:37:50,MAN: There's no way you'll get a jury to believe this evidence wasn't fabricated.
586,00:37:58,00:38:01,(Brass sighs)
587,00:38:04,00:38:07,Which one of you screwed this up?
588,00:38:07,00:38:09,I'm looking at him.
589,00:38:09,00:38:12,"You dropped the ball, man."
590,00:38:12,00:38:16,"You never cleared this operation with the D.A., and now, she says she can't tell fact from fiction."
591,00:38:16,00:38:18,She's not going to file charges against Simon.
592,00:38:18,00:38:22,She's a tight-ass-- I told her what I thought she needed to know.
593,00:38:22,00:38:25,BRASS: Did you hear what I said?
594,00:38:25,00:38:27,"Now, what are you going to tell the sheriff?"
595,00:38:35,00:38:37,It's called reverse forensics.
596,00:38:37,00:38:40,Reverse forensics?
597,00:38:40,00:38:42,Simon had to believe it when he saw it on the news.
598,00:38:42,00:38:43,He was a fugitive.
599,00:38:43,00:38:47,The only way to get him to show his face was to make him think he was off the hook.
600,00:38:47,00:38:52,And your only option was to fabricate evidence and make me process it?
601,00:38:52,00:38:54,How could you think that we wouldn't figure it out?
602,00:38:55,00:38:57,It's kind of what we do.
603,00:38:57,00:38:58,I understand how you all feel.
604,00:38:58,00:39:00,I am sorry. I did not have a choice.
605,00:39:00,00:39:04,"We trust you with our lives, Catherine."
606,00:39:04,00:39:06,You could have trusted us with this.
607,00:39:11,00:39:13,Sara?
608,00:39:14,00:39:18,"If I have something to say to you, Catherine, I'm gonna say it in private."
609,00:39:19,00:39:21,No offense.
610,00:39:22,00:39:24,"WILLOWS: Okay, look."
611,00:39:25,00:39:26,We can still get Simon.
612,00:39:27,00:39:30,He only walked on Zamesca.
613,00:39:30,00:39:33,He drove Monique Carter's vehicle out into the desert.
614,00:39:33,00:39:35,Nick's established that.
615,00:39:37,00:39:39,"Did he kill her, too?"
616,00:39:43,00:39:49,SANDERS: Three calls were made from Monique's cell phone to Simon's strip club after she died.
617,00:39:49,00:39:53,"There's another half a dozen calls to Hugh Griffin, Bud Small, Frank Townsend."
618,00:39:53,00:39:54,All known associates.
619,00:39:54,00:39:57,"He was using her phone to do business, thinking it was safe."
620,00:39:57,00:40:00,"Oh, yeah, the last call was made to his wife's cell."
621,00:40:07,00:40:08,What hasn't been cleaned?
622,00:40:08,00:40:10,SIDLE: Furniture.
623,00:40:11,00:40:17,"If Simon was hiding out here for a couple of weeks, he had to eat, sleep and use the bathroom."
624,00:40:17,00:40:19,"So, what did the cleaners miss?"
625,00:40:20,00:40:22,There used to be a pillow here.
626,00:40:23,00:40:23,Maybe...
627,00:40:24,00:40:25,he slept on the couch.
628,00:40:25,00:40:28,I'm going to pull some hair 'cause you never know.
629,00:40:28,00:40:32,STOKES: We'd have to get a court order to compel a DNA sample from Simon.
630,00:40:32,00:40:37,"That takes time. Brass can only stall this guy's release for a couple hours, you know."
631,00:40:41,00:40:46,"Yeah, it's going to take days to sort through these."
632,00:40:46,00:40:48,(sighs)
633,00:41:00,00:41:01,Sara.
634,00:41:02,00:41:03,It's a pullout.
635,00:41:43,00:41:45,(woman yelling)
636,00:41:57,00:42:00,"RADIO HOST: Welcome back to the voice of Las Vegas, KWMS radio."
637,00:42:00,00:42:06,"Today, Thomas Simon, alleged drug kingpin, was charged with the slaying of former attorney Monique Carter."
638,00:42:06,00:42:13,"Ms. Carter and Assemblyman Zamesca were classmates in law school, and police are continuing to investigate the link between the two crimes."
639,00:42:17,00:42:19,So I dig up a ghost.
640,00:42:19,00:42:24,"I know he has a son who was killed by drug dealers, she's being killed by drugs."
641,00:42:24,00:42:28,"He's got a savior complex, so I use her to lure him out into the desert."
642,00:42:28,00:42:30,It's why I drive her car.
643,00:42:30,00:42:33,"So he'll recognize it, feel safe."
644,00:42:33,00:42:36,You are aware that you talk about the killer in the first person?
645,00:42:38,00:42:41,"That's the point, isn't it?"
646,00:42:41,00:42:43,Clouds my judgment to identify with the victims.
647,00:42:43,00:42:47,Our job is to catch killers.
648,00:42:47,00:42:48,(sighs)
649,00:42:48,00:42:50,Guess it helps me to think like one.
650,00:42:55,00:42:58,"You want to, uh, get a drink or something?"
651,00:42:58,00:42:59,Nah.
652,00:42:59,00:43:01,"No, I'm, I'm tired."
653,00:43:01,00:43:02,I'm going home. Nick.
654,00:43:02,00:43:04,Nick!
655,00:43:07,00:43:09,"Let it go, man."
656,00:43:16,00:43:23,Tonight we're talking about the anti-drug legislation sponsored by the late Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca.
657,00:43:23,00:43:27,It was passed into law today by the Nevada State Legislature.
658,00:43:27,00:43:29,"Tony from Seven Hills, you're on the air."
