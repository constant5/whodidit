0,00:00:02,00:00:06,"WOMAN: You can tell by the neuro-intergalactic vibrations, the invasion's coming."
1,00:00:06,00:00:09,You know they're watching us right now.
2,00:00:09,00:00:13,These other dimensions-- they're everywhere.
3,00:00:13,00:00:29,"And string-- it's obvious-- string is the thing that connects everything, and I'm not talking about the stuff you can see: protons, photons, fig newtons, electrons, neutrons and time..."
4,00:00:29,00:00:31,and space...
5,00:00:31,00:00:33,Timeandspace?
6,00:00:33,00:00:34,All right. I'm thinking probable cause...
7,00:00:34,00:00:38,"I see you, turning your back on me, shaking your head."
8,00:00:38,00:00:40,I can't help you.
9,00:00:40,00:00:43,"Ignore the truth at your own peril, sir."
10,00:00:43,00:00:45,At your own peril.
11,00:00:45,00:00:51,"Hi, see, we can't see the strings 'cause they're invisible, buttheycan 'cause they're the 11th dimension."
12,00:00:51,00:00:53,"Hey, you're ready for them tonight, Evelyn."
13,00:00:53,00:00:54,The invasion's tonight.
14,00:00:54,00:00:57,Don't say I didn't warn you.
15,00:00:57,00:00:59,What's the matter? Can't look?
16,00:00:59,00:01:00,You know what that tells me?
17,00:01:00,00:01:02,That you did it.
18,00:01:02,00:01:05,"You shot her, you put a dress on her."
19,00:01:06,00:01:09,"I mean, the trooper saw you put the body in the back of your pickup truck."
20,00:01:09,00:01:11,"Anything else you did, we're going to find out."
21,00:01:11,00:01:14,That's whathe'sdoing.
22,00:01:14,00:01:17,And the body is in autopsy right now.
23,00:01:21,00:01:24,"Oh, this must be our Jane Doe."
24,00:01:24,00:01:26,"Doe, a deer."
25,00:01:26,00:01:27,A female deer.
26,00:01:28,00:01:29,It's not funny.
27,00:01:29,00:01:30,It's a little funny.
28,00:01:30,00:01:32,"Doc, I already took photos."
29,00:01:32,00:01:35,"Not formyscrapbook, you didn't."
30,00:01:35,00:01:36,This is animal abuse.
31,00:01:36,00:01:37,"The killing, sure."
32,00:01:38,00:01:39,The dress?
33,00:01:39,00:01:42,Pet owners put sweaters on chihuahuas.
34,00:01:42,00:01:45,Just give me a hand with the arrow.
35,00:01:53,00:01:57,"Hmm, it's not an arrow; it's a bolt shot from a crossbow."
36,00:01:58,00:02:01,(sniffs) Alcohol.
37,00:02:02,00:02:04,You think he had to get her liquored up?
38,00:02:04,00:02:11,"Okay, so you got a DUI, resisting arrest, several new and unique wildlife violations."
39,00:02:11,00:02:13,"You're in a truckload of trouble, Kyle."
40,00:02:13,00:02:17,I... I... I found her like that.
41,00:02:17,00:02:19,In a cocktail dress?
42,00:02:19,00:02:22,(laughs)
43,00:02:22,00:02:24,I didn't put no dress on her.
44,00:02:24,00:02:27,"Oh, no, no, no... see, I was..."
45,00:02:27,00:02:30,I was taking her to the vet.
46,00:02:30,00:02:32,You sure it wasn't a nightclub?
47,00:02:32,00:02:36,"Then how do you explain the crossbow I found in your truck there, boss?"
48,00:02:36,00:02:38,Easy. Somebody put it there.
49,00:02:38,00:02:41,"Okay, take a deep breath for me now."
50,00:02:41,00:02:44,Blow into this.
51,00:02:46,00:02:47,"Come on, guys. I mean, can't..."
52,00:02:47,00:02:48,can't you give me a break here?
53,00:02:48,00:02:50,"I mean, look, no, here..."
54,00:02:50,00:02:52,I... I... I just got a...
55,00:02:52,00:02:58,"I got a divorce, right, and my ex just cleaned me out."
56,00:02:58,00:02:59,Let me guess: her name is Bambi.
57,00:03:01,00:03:04,Blow! (inhales)
58,00:03:04,00:03:06,(exhaling)
59,00:03:14,00:03:15,Stop him!
60,00:03:29,00:03:30,(grunts)
61,00:03:31,00:03:33,"Move, move, move! Get out of the way!"
62,00:03:33,00:03:34,Get out of the way!
63,00:03:35,00:03:37,(groaning)
64,00:03:40,00:03:42,(groaning)
65,00:03:43,00:03:44,Hey!
66,00:03:44,00:03:46,"Hey, hey, hey, citizens arrest!"
67,00:03:51,00:03:52,Light him up.
68,00:03:55,00:03:58,(screaming)
69,00:04:01,00:04:05,Now do you believe me?
70,00:04:46,00:04:50,"Stun guns aren't necessarily nonlethal, justlesslethal."
71,00:04:53,00:04:56,AFID tags confirm it was Officer Choi's weapon.
72,00:04:58,00:05:01,"You know, I don't get it."
73,00:05:01,00:05:07,"Suspect makes a break for it, clocks a couple of unis, gets pepper-sprayed, and keeps going."
74,00:05:07,00:05:09,Pepper spray doesn't always stop them when they're really drunk.
75,00:05:09,00:05:12,Suspect blew a .28.
76,00:05:12,00:05:14,"Oh, well, maybe he was a sloppy drunk."
77,00:05:14,00:05:16,Any alcohol on his clothes?
78,00:05:16,00:05:18,He'd been in PD for hours. Alcohol would have evaporated.
79,00:05:19,00:05:20,STOKES: I'm gonna need your stun gun.
80,00:05:20,00:05:21,Am I in trouble?
81,00:05:21,00:05:23,When was the last time you had this thing serviced?
82,00:05:23,00:05:25,Not since I've been on the force.
83,00:05:25,00:05:27,That's only six months now.
84,00:05:27,00:05:29,"We'll have it analyzed, see if it was malfunctioning."
85,00:05:29,00:05:32,That's the first time I had to shoot it.
86,00:05:32,00:05:33,"Relax, man."
87,00:05:33,00:05:35,You were following captain's orders.
88,00:05:35,00:05:37,"When you talk to IA, just be honest..."
89,00:05:37,00:05:38,and don't expect a hug.
90,00:05:38,00:05:43,"That's when you said to your officer, I quote, ""Light him up."" Poor choice of words."
91,00:05:43,00:05:46,We followed the proper procedure for escalation of force.
92,00:05:46,00:05:47,"I mean, at least we didn't shoot him."
93,00:05:47,00:05:48,"Of course, that would have killed him."
94,00:05:48,00:05:52,"As far as my office is concerned, we got an in-custody death on your orders."
95,00:05:52,00:05:58,"Doesn't get much worse. Look, we use stun guns all the time around here; this is the first one that caught on fire."
96,00:05:58,00:05:59,What do you think?
97,00:05:59,00:06:01,Maybe this guy had so much booze it made him a Roman candle?
98,00:06:01,00:06:04,"Well, unfortunately, human blood is 83% water."
99,00:06:04,00:06:07,"It's just not flammable, no matter how drunk you are."
100,00:06:07,00:06:11,That's too bad. Might have let you off the hook.
101,00:06:14,00:06:18,"Together in death, as they were in life."
102,00:06:18,00:06:21,Guy abuses wildlife and then bursts into flames.
103,00:06:21,00:06:23,I call it karma.
104,00:06:24,00:06:28,There are no physical signs their relationship was anything other than platonic.
105,00:06:28,00:06:33,"I mean, we're the ones encroaching ontheirhabitat-- you don't seethemshootingus."
106,00:06:34,00:06:37,Consider this justice for Bambi's mother.
107,00:06:55,00:06:56,Light him up.
108,00:07:04,00:07:07,This is the rest of the stuff that we got from the dead guy's truck.
109,00:07:11,00:07:13,One crossbow.
110,00:07:13,00:07:18,Same bolts we recovered from the dead deer.
111,00:07:18,00:07:21,Couple of mason jars.
112,00:07:22,00:07:25,Whew! Moonshine.
113,00:07:25,00:07:26,Home brew.
114,00:07:26,00:07:27,Firewater.
115,00:07:27,00:07:30,"Grain alcohol's 190 proof, you know?"
116,00:07:30,00:07:31,That's 95% alcohol.
117,00:07:31,00:07:33,Who was he trying to forget?
118,00:07:33,00:07:35,"Well, Brass said that he'd just gotten divorced."
119,00:07:35,00:07:37,Welcome to the club.
120,00:07:37,00:07:41,"You see any night-vision goggles or, uh, spotlights in that box?"
121,00:07:42,00:07:43,"No, why?"
122,00:07:43,00:07:45,Well...
123,00:07:45,00:07:50,I think he must have shot the deer during the day and then waited until dark to put her in his truck.
124,00:07:50,00:07:54,That's a long time just sitting out in the woods drinking.
125,00:07:54,00:07:55,Stun gun checks out.
126,00:07:55,00:07:56,Operates as designed.
127,00:07:56,00:07:59,"Puts out the standard 50,000 volts."
128,00:07:59,00:08:01,"Well, that eliminates one variable."
129,00:08:01,00:08:07,"Leaves us with the shirt, the grain alcohol, and the pepper spray."
130,00:08:07,00:08:10,Time to find out if one of those made him catch on fire.
131,00:08:12,00:08:14,"Don't tase me, bro."
132,00:08:15,00:08:16,Don't tempt me.
133,00:08:56,00:08:59,What are we missing?
134,00:09:01,00:09:06,"JOHNSON: Either she's a 421-Adam, or somewhere a scarecrow and a lion are looking for their friend."
135,00:09:06,00:09:07,STOKES: That's Evelyn.
136,00:09:07,00:09:09,She's wearing her deflector suit.
137,00:09:09,00:09:14,"Every night, she comes down to PD at some point, and she files a complaint againstthem."
138,00:09:14,00:09:16,What didthemdo toher?
139,00:09:16,00:09:23,"Everything, from stealing her thoughts to raping her, but even if she is crazy, she's a variable in all this."
140,00:09:23,00:09:28,"See, there may have been some sort of transfer between her and burning man."
141,00:09:28,00:09:30,She didn't stick around for the debrief.
142,00:09:30,00:09:32,"Well, can you blame her?"
143,00:09:32,00:09:36,She just witnessed spontaneous alien combustion.
144,00:09:36,00:09:38,And you didn't hold her. No.
145,00:09:38,00:09:41,Did you get a statement?
146,00:09:41,00:09:43,Where is she now?
147,00:09:43,00:09:45,We don't know.
148,00:09:45,00:09:47,There's a lot you don't know.
149,00:09:47,00:09:49,You can count on three things happening every day around here.
150,00:09:49,00:09:58,The coffee machine's going to break down; some tourist is going to swear the hooker was over 18; and Evelyn's going to show up.
151,00:09:58,00:10:00,We got a broadcast out.
152,00:10:00,00:10:01,We'll find her.
153,00:10:01,00:10:03,She's very shiny.
154,00:10:15,00:10:17,It's gotta be getting hot under all that foil.
155,00:10:17,00:10:19,She's going to cook out here fast.
156,00:10:19,00:10:21,Aw...
157,00:10:21,00:10:23,Evelyn.
158,00:10:28,00:10:30,What happened?
159,00:10:30,00:10:31,The driver...
160,00:10:31,00:10:32,said his shift was over.
161,00:10:32,00:10:35,He was just taking the truck back to the yard.
162,00:10:35,00:10:38,Said a flash of light came out of nowhere.
163,00:10:40,00:10:43,(tires screeching)
164,00:10:43,00:10:46,The sun was just coming up.
165,00:10:46,00:10:48,Reflection off of her suit must have blinded him.
166,00:10:49,00:10:54,"Okay, well, this tin foil's evidence in two cases now, so we've got to be careful with it."
167,00:10:57,00:11:00,Butane lighter.
168,00:11:00,00:11:01,It's cracked.
169,00:11:01,00:11:03,Looks empty.
170,00:11:03,00:11:06,That could be what lit the flame in your deer hunter.
171,00:11:06,00:11:07,I'll check the foil for butane.
172,00:11:08,00:11:10,"Trouble is, it's probably evaporated by now."
173,00:11:11,00:11:14,200 bucks.
174,00:11:14,00:11:15,"Okay, turn her over, Dave."
175,00:11:15,00:11:16,Sure.
176,00:11:20,00:11:22,Guys. We got some green fluid here.
177,00:11:22,00:11:25,It's coming from the wound.
178,00:11:25,00:11:26,STOKES: Damn!
179,00:11:26,00:11:28,I think that's blood.
180,00:11:54,00:11:56,SANDERS: Take a look.
181,00:11:56,00:11:57,You're not going to believe it.
182,00:11:59,00:12:01,Another 419 with green blood.
183,00:12:01,00:12:03,What are the odds?
184,00:12:05,00:12:07,That he's not connected to our first victim?
185,00:12:07,00:12:08,Astronomical.
186,00:12:08,00:12:11,Looks like blunt-force trauma to me.
187,00:12:11,00:12:14,"GRISSOM: You know, Tin Foil Lady was run over just a few blocks from here."
188,00:12:14,00:12:17,I bet this area was home to both of them.
189,00:12:23,00:12:25,(shutter clicks)
190,00:12:35,00:12:36,Three pairs of sunglasses?
191,00:12:45,00:12:47,Earplugs.
192,00:12:47,00:12:53,"That, David, is how you make it dark and quiet when you sleep on the street."
193,00:12:56,00:12:58,(shutter clicks)
194,00:13:02,00:13:04,SANDERS: Hey!
195,00:13:04,00:13:05,I think I found the weapon!
196,00:13:07,00:13:10,We should be able to get some good prints off it.
197,00:13:26,00:13:31,"I've seen green blood before, but only from bodies in advanced stages of decomp."
198,00:13:33,00:13:35,What do you think turned it green?
199,00:13:35,00:13:37,I suspect it might be sulfur.
200,00:13:37,00:13:40,"Hmm, sulfur's a naturally occurring component of blood."
201,00:13:40,00:13:45,"Yes, but in massive doses it tends to turn the blood a blackish avocado green."
202,00:13:45,00:13:50,"When the sulfur atom joins the hemoglobin molecules, red blood turns green."
203,00:13:52,00:13:55,Which is why First Officer Spock's blood is green inStar Trek.
204,00:13:55,00:13:56,"No, it's not."
205,00:13:56,00:13:58,"Uh, yes, it is."
206,00:13:58,00:14:00,Trust me. I'm an expert.
207,00:14:00,00:14:05,"Well, apparently not, because otherwise you would surely know that the oxidizing agent in Vulcan blood is copper."
208,00:14:05,00:14:07,And that is why his blood is green.
209,00:14:08,00:14:13,"Well, it was that and the fact that he had a Vulcan father, since his mother was actually human."
210,00:14:13,00:14:21,"And furthermore, he was promoted to Captain just prior toStar Trek II and then he retired as civilian ambassador."
211,00:14:22,00:14:25,"You're like a geeky, nerdy guy trapped in a woman's body."
212,00:14:25,00:14:27,So are you.
213,00:14:31,00:14:40,"Well, as I was saying, here on Earth, sulfur-containing compounds could turn otherwise normal blood green."
214,00:14:47,00:14:48,As I suspected.
215,00:14:48,00:14:50,What? Share.
216,00:14:53,00:14:54,She wasn't a Vulcan.
217,00:14:56,00:14:58,Thank you.
218,00:15:03,00:15:07,"I don't want to take all the credit, but I do know why both your victims have green blood."
219,00:15:07,00:15:08,High levels of sulfur.
220,00:15:08,00:15:11,(sighs): Yes.
221,00:15:12,00:15:14,Did you identify the source yet?
222,00:15:14,00:15:19,Not yet. I'll get the blood over to Henry and have him run a tox panel for sulfuric compounds.
223,00:15:19,00:15:25,"Oh, and even if your tin foil lady was gushing blood, it would not have contributed to your stun gun guy's immolation."
224,00:15:25,00:15:27,Did you find anything on the foil?
225,00:15:27,00:15:29,Bacon grease and trace amounts of ketchup.
226,00:15:29,00:15:33,"Both things you would find at a barbeque, but not the kind that you're dealing with."
227,00:15:33,00:15:35,(knocking)
228,00:15:35,00:15:36,Brass just called.
229,00:15:36,00:15:39,Our lonely deer hunter's parents just hired a lawyer.
230,00:15:39,00:15:40,The department's going to be sued.
231,00:15:40,00:15:42,We haven't even released the case details yet.
232,00:15:42,00:15:45,Our investigation's still ongoing.
233,00:15:45,00:15:47,"Well, they got something we don't."
234,00:15:47,00:15:49,Move! Move! Move!
235,00:15:49,00:15:50,Get away! Get away!
236,00:15:50,00:15:52,(shouting continues on video)
237,00:15:52,00:15:54,"Over 60,000 hits since it was posted."
238,00:15:54,00:15:56,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
239,00:15:56,00:16:03,"STOKES: Here, on the PD surveillance, this ambulance chaser on his cell phone-- he's a regular."
240,00:16:03,00:16:06,Want to bet he's the one that shot the footage?
241,00:16:06,00:16:07,Want to bet he's the one filing suit?
242,00:16:08,00:16:12,"Well, his cell phone has a better angle than the PD surveillance camera."
243,00:16:12,00:16:14,"Archie, run this back to where he gets sprayed."
244,00:16:14,00:16:16,(typing)
245,00:16:17,00:16:18,Get away! Wait a minute.
246,00:16:18,00:16:20,Tighten up on the can.
247,00:16:21,00:16:29,"Nick, when we did the experiment with Jell-O Man, we used pepper spray from a red can, right?"
248,00:16:29,00:16:31,"Yeah. Yeah, department-issue."
249,00:16:31,00:16:32,Got it through Logistics.
250,00:16:32,00:16:34,That one's yellow.
251,00:16:37,00:16:40,I've used my pepper spray half a dozen times on the street.
252,00:16:40,00:16:43,All I had to do was write a use-of-force memo.
253,00:16:43,00:16:46,"BRASS: Speaking of memos, didn't you get the one we issued about five years ago?"
254,00:16:47,00:16:51,"I know what you mean. Yeah, you know, when the department switched over to water-based pepper spray."
255,00:16:51,00:16:54,STOKES: This one uses isobutane.
256,00:16:54,00:16:56,"Compressed gas, highly flammable stuff."
257,00:16:57,00:16:57,Where's yours?
258,00:16:57,00:16:59,"It's Murphy's Law, right?"
259,00:16:59,00:17:04,"I always got my gear together, wired tight, but last night my girl takes my pepper spray."
260,00:17:04,00:17:06,And I don't blame her because she's got a dangerous job.
261,00:17:06,00:17:07,"Oh, yeah? What does she do?"
262,00:17:07,00:17:09,She goes to WLVU during the day.
263,00:17:09,00:17:13,"She studies kinesiology, but she dances nights at the Acid Strip."
264,00:17:13,00:17:15,(chuckles)
265,00:17:15,00:17:17,"What does she clip the can to, her G-string?"
266,00:17:17,00:17:20,"It'd be a deterrent to stuffing a tip in there, wouldn't it?"
267,00:17:20,00:17:24,Come on; she walks to the parking lot alone at 4:00 a.m.
268,00:17:24,00:17:31,"Okay, so she takes your department-issue, so what'd you do? Pick up an old can lying around? No, bought one at Catalani's Gun World on the way in."
269,00:17:31,00:17:32,I didn't get a chance to change it out.
270,00:17:32,00:17:34,Does it really matter?
271,00:17:34,00:17:36,It might.
272,00:17:36,00:17:38,(misting)
273,00:18:06,00:18:08,(laughs)
274,00:18:25,00:18:26,"Hey, Greg."
275,00:18:26,00:18:29,I just ran your pipe over to Prints after I sampled it for blood.
276,00:18:29,00:18:30,"Yeah, did you find something wrong?"
277,00:18:30,00:18:32,I found something weird.
278,00:18:32,00:18:34,One end of the pipe was covered with blood from the victim.
279,00:18:34,00:18:38,"Yeah, the administrator at the shelter ID'd him as Wayne Connor, homeless."
280,00:18:38,00:18:42,"Well, then on the other end of the pipe, I found several small blood smears from an unknown donor."
281,00:18:42,00:18:43,So the killer was also injured.
282,00:18:43,00:18:46,"Mm-hmm. His blood's green, too."
283,00:18:47,00:18:49,"GRISSOM: ""Once is happenstance."
284,00:18:49,00:18:50,"""Twice is coincidence."
285,00:18:50,00:18:55,"Three times is enemy action."" HODGES: Winston Churchill? Ian Fleming."
286,00:18:55,00:18:57,I should know that.
287,00:18:57,00:18:58,I'm a huge James Bond fan.
288,00:18:58,00:19:01,What aren't you a fan of?
289,00:19:01,00:19:04,I ran the green bloods for sulfur-containing compounds.
290,00:19:04,00:19:11,"Still working on the third donor, but Evelyn Polychronopolous and Wayne Connor both had high levels of thiocyte in their systems."
291,00:19:11,00:19:13,Prescription medication for migraines.
292,00:19:13,00:19:15,ANDREWS: I checked with the downtown pharmacies.
293,00:19:15,00:19:16,They don't dispense it.
294,00:19:16,00:19:20,154 nanograms per milliliter-- that's overdose levels.
295,00:19:20,00:19:23,"Even if they were in a clinical trial, they wouldn't get that much."
296,00:19:24,00:19:27,"It's not a typical drug of abuse. GRISSOM: Yeah, but if you've got a migraine, you'll do anything to stop the pain."
297,00:19:27,00:19:29,How do you know they had migraines?
298,00:19:29,00:19:34,"Well, aside from the medication, Connor was wearing three pairs of sunglasses and earplugs."
299,00:19:34,00:19:38,Photo- and phonosensitivity are symptoms of migraines.
300,00:19:38,00:19:41,"Maybe that's why Evelyn thought ""they"" were invading her brain."
301,00:19:41,00:19:45,She was killed only a few blocks from the vacant lot with a couple hundred dollars on her.
302,00:19:45,00:19:52,"She could have been on her way to a drug buy. So if we can figure out who's selling the drugs, it may lead us to who killed Connor."
303,00:19:54,00:19:56,(siren chirps)
304,00:20:00,00:20:01,Damn busy day.
305,00:20:01,00:20:03,"Hmm, where are they?"
306,00:20:03,00:20:04,"Inside, end of the hall."
307,00:20:05,00:20:07,Mailman got worried when they didn't come to the door.
308,00:20:07,00:20:09,"We did a welfare check, found them both in the bed."
309,00:20:09,00:20:11,Doc.
310,00:20:11,00:20:12,ROBBINS: Catherine.
311,00:20:12,00:20:17,No forced entry; no sign of trauma; bodies don't look posed.
312,00:20:17,00:20:20,"No gas odor, no petechiae."
313,00:20:20,00:20:22,No sign of suffocation.
314,00:20:22,00:20:23,So why'd you call CSI?
315,00:20:23,00:20:25,Couple in their late 60s.
316,00:20:25,00:20:28,What are the chances they died of natural causes at the same time?
317,00:20:36,00:20:38,"""Digoxin."
318,00:20:38,00:20:41,"""Warfarin."
319,00:20:41,00:20:46,"Amiodarone."" Those are all heart medications. Mm-hmm."
320,00:20:48,00:20:51,"""Zolpidem."" That's for sleep. I know."
321,00:20:51,00:20:53,Bottle's almost full.
322,00:20:53,00:20:56,"No foaming at the mouth, no note left behind."
323,00:20:56,00:20:58,I don't think this is a double suicide.
324,00:20:59,00:21:02,Suspicious circs.
325,00:21:02,00:21:04,Good call.
326,00:21:04,00:21:06,They look like they loved each other.
327,00:21:06,00:21:07,(knocking)
328,00:21:12,00:21:14,CATHERINE: Looks likeCaddyshackback here.
329,00:21:15,00:21:16,Invasion of the ground squirrels.
330,00:21:16,00:21:17,(shutter clicks)
331,00:21:17,00:21:19,"Yeah, I got a few casualties out here."
332,00:21:19,00:21:21,I see.
333,00:21:21,00:21:23,What the hell is that?
334,00:21:23,00:21:25,"Looks like a close encounter, right?"
335,00:21:31,00:21:38,"""Atomic Dave's Painless Removals."" Some kind of pest control gizmo."
336,00:21:38,00:21:39,"Apparently, it works."
337,00:21:39,00:21:44,"I don't think the squirrels would agree that it's painless, though."
338,00:21:48,00:21:51,Shrodinger Martin?
339,00:21:51,00:21:52,(chuckles)
340,00:21:52,00:21:55,He had a cat named Shrodinger.
341,00:21:55,00:21:58,Must have been into physics.
342,00:21:58,00:21:59,Cat grave.
343,00:21:59,00:22:00,(chuckles)
344,00:22:00,00:22:02,"Dead cat, dead critters, dead couple."
345,00:22:02,00:22:04,(clanking loudly)
346,00:22:04,00:22:07,(power tool running)
347,00:22:16,00:22:19,Imagine living next door to that racket.
348,00:22:30,00:22:32,WOMAN: Last night?
349,00:22:32,00:22:35,I was in my studio.
350,00:22:35,00:22:37,I'm an artist.
351,00:22:38,00:22:40,Didn't your neighbors complain about the noise?
352,00:22:40,00:22:41,(chuckles)
353,00:22:41,00:22:43,I don't weld at night.
354,00:22:43,00:22:45,I work on my jewelry.
355,00:22:45,00:22:46,High-end stuff.
356,00:22:47,00:22:48,Nice.
357,00:22:48,00:22:51,"Listen, how well did you know your neighbors, the Martins?"
358,00:22:51,00:22:52,Are they dead?
359,00:22:52,00:22:53,Yeah.
360,00:22:53,00:22:54,They passed away last night.
361,00:22:54,00:22:56,Hardly knew them.
362,00:22:56,00:22:58,"Heard he was a, uh..."
363,00:22:58,00:22:59,(grunting): ...professor or something.
364,00:23:00,00:23:01,"Yeah, we really didn't have too much in common."
365,00:23:01,00:23:05,"Well, apparently, you both shared a ground squirrel problem."
366,00:23:05,00:23:06,(sighs)
367,00:23:07,00:23:08,"Could be worse, I guess."
368,00:23:08,00:23:10,I could still be with my deadbeat ex.
369,00:23:10,00:23:14,There's a pest I did get rid of.
370,00:23:14,00:23:15,"ROBBINS: Hey, Catherine."
371,00:23:16,00:23:17,Hi.
372,00:23:17,00:23:18,What a relief.
373,00:23:18,00:23:20,Two red-blooded Americans.
374,00:23:20,00:23:25,"According to his stomach contents, he likes a glass of red wine with his pasta."
375,00:23:27,00:23:30,Looks like suppertime was about four hours premortem.
376,00:23:31,00:23:33,Take a look at the light board.
377,00:23:35,00:23:37,Both Martins wore pacemakers.
378,00:23:37,00:23:38,Mrs. Martin's is in that bowl.
379,00:23:41,00:23:43,(ticking)
380,00:23:43,00:23:47,Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
381,00:23:47,00:23:49,"Yeah, I hope mine's still working when I pop off."
382,00:23:49,00:23:51,You wear a pacemaker?
383,00:23:51,00:23:54,Bradycardia-- slow heart.
384,00:23:54,00:24:02,"Every once in a while, just to make sure I don't skip a beat, the pacer kicks in, just like this one."
385,00:24:02,00:24:05,"Well, obviously, they didn't die of pacer malfunction."
386,00:24:05,00:24:08,(beeping)
387,00:24:10,00:24:11,What you got?
388,00:24:11,00:24:13,Check this out.
389,00:24:13,00:24:16,It's like having a witness to his death inside his body.
390,00:24:16,00:24:19,"There's no interruption in his pacemaker functions, but..."
391,00:24:19,00:24:23,"about eight hours before he died, there was a spike in his heart rate."
392,00:24:23,00:24:28,"His wife's is almost identical, so something got their hearts racing."
393,00:24:28,00:24:32,"Who knows? Maybe they, uh, enjoyed a little afternoon delight. Well, let's hope."
394,00:24:32,00:24:38,"(chuckles) Either way, their heartbeats went back to normal and they died in their sleep a few hours later."
395,00:24:40,00:24:42,(computer beeping)
396,00:25:12,00:25:15,(beeping continues)
397,00:25:25,00:25:29,(line ringing)
398,00:25:29,00:25:35,"Okay, so I've been thinking this over and here's my advice."
399,00:25:35,00:25:38,"If you want to get a real relationship with a girl, you are going to have to move out of Mom's."
400,00:25:39,00:25:41,No girl wants the competition.
401,00:25:41,00:25:43,I'm sorry.
402,00:25:46,00:25:49,(beeping)
403,00:25:57,00:25:59,(man screaming)
404,00:26:02,00:26:04,"Oh, God, no, no, turn 'em off. Turn 'em off. Turn 'em off."
405,00:26:05,00:26:07,"David Bohr, you're under arrest for the murder of Wayne Connor."
406,00:26:07,00:26:09,"No, no, it was self-defense."
407,00:26:10,00:26:12,He tried to kill me over a couple hundred bucks.
408,00:26:13,00:26:14,He needed some stuff.
409,00:26:14,00:26:18,He couldn't pay. He said some money was coming.
410,00:26:18,00:26:19,I had to go to work.
411,00:26:19,00:26:21,I turned to leave and he comes at me like an animal.
412,00:26:21,00:26:23,"I have to go. No, no, no, no."
413,00:26:23,00:26:26,(both grunting)
414,00:26:32,00:26:33,This is Captain Brass.
415,00:26:33,00:26:36,We need a Code 3 paramedic response to my location.
416,00:26:36,00:26:38,(screaming): No!
417,00:28:01,00:28:02,"(door opens) BROWN: Thanks, man."
418,00:28:02,00:28:03,"Hey, I got your page."
419,00:28:03,00:28:04,What's up?
420,00:28:04,00:28:05,I think our cases might be connected.
421,00:28:05,00:28:08,Take a look at that.
422,00:28:11,00:28:18,So my green-blooded victim from the vacant lot was buying pharmaceuticals from the guy who did pest removal for your dead couple.
423,00:28:20,00:28:24,Looks like this guy was trying to create radio frequencies or something.
424,00:28:24,00:28:32,"Well, I don't know what kind of effect that has on household pests, but radio waves can produce ""noise on the channel,"" which could interfere with pacemaker function."
425,00:28:33,00:28:34,Thing is...
426,00:28:34,00:28:36,the Martins' pacemakers are still ticking.
427,00:28:38,00:28:40,"Ah, the luck of the Irish."
428,00:28:40,00:28:42,"It makes sense, though."
429,00:28:42,00:28:45,"If his blood was green, his organs would be green."
430,00:28:45,00:28:47,"Well, frankly, I expected something more in the..."
431,00:28:47,00:28:49,"dark avocado, almost black range."
432,00:28:49,00:28:52,"Yeah, this is more artichoke."
433,00:28:52,00:28:53,(chuckles)
434,00:28:53,00:28:55,"You know, atmospheric sulfur levels are on the rise."
435,00:28:55,00:28:58,"Hundred years, we're all going to look like spinach."
436,00:28:58,00:28:59,(sighs)
437,00:28:59,00:29:00,You guys didn't wait for me.
438,00:29:00,00:29:02,We're just about to excise his brain.
439,00:29:02,00:29:06,"I'll bet you five bucks, Greg, that his brain is not as green as his heart."
440,00:29:06,00:29:08,"Keep your money in your pockets, Greg."
441,00:29:08,00:29:11,There's a higher vascular nature to the heart and lungs.
442,00:29:11,00:29:14,Only the blood vessels in the brain are going to be green.
443,00:29:14,00:29:15,It's a sucker bet and you know it.
444,00:29:15,00:29:17,"Well, thanks, Doc."
445,00:29:17,00:29:27,"So, uh, Dave here did some humane rodent pest removal for Desert Palm Hospital, which is where he got his hands on the thiocyte."
446,00:29:27,00:29:28,He was all about freedom from pain.
447,00:29:36,00:29:38,Ah.
448,00:29:38,00:29:39,Sea foam.
449,00:29:39,00:29:41,A lovely shade.
450,00:29:54,00:29:56,Look at the size of that.
451,00:29:56,00:30:01,He had a brain tumor pressing on the amygdala.
452,00:30:01,00:30:04,"Well, this could cause his migraines."
453,00:30:04,00:30:10,"Absolutely, and also aggressive disruptive behavior, paranoia."
454,00:30:10,00:30:15,"As the tumor enlarged, it impacted the arteries, causing the cerebral hemorrhage that you observed."
455,00:30:15,00:30:16,(screaming)
456,00:30:16,00:30:19,He was self-medicating for the wrong condition.
457,00:30:19,00:30:21,No wonder he overdosed.
458,00:30:22,00:30:24,WILLOWS: Let 'er rip.
459,00:30:24,00:30:27,(whirring)
460,00:30:29,00:30:34,"In order to interfere with pacemaker function, it'd have to be putting out between 50 and 60 hertz."
461,00:30:35,00:30:37,"Okay, I'll input that range. (typing)"
462,00:30:44,00:30:47,This thing isn't putting out anything that's lethal.
463,00:30:47,00:30:50,Tox report showed that the medications weren't lethal.
464,00:30:50,00:30:51,This thing's harmless.
465,00:30:51,00:30:53,I refuse to believe it was natural causes.
466,00:30:53,00:30:55,It's too big of a coincidence.
467,00:30:55,00:30:59,So we've got a dead cat and dead squirrels.
468,00:30:59,00:31:02,Maybe what killed them is what killed the Martins.
469,00:31:16,00:31:32,"In an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle-- October 31, 1996, if I recall correctly-- one Professor Gilbert Grissom revealed that as a boy, he collected dead animals he found in his Marina del Rey neighborhood and performed necropsies on them."
470,00:31:32,00:31:34,Hodges...
471,00:31:34,00:31:36,I want you to stop stalking me.
472,00:31:37,00:31:40,(sniffing)
473,00:31:43,00:31:46,Bitter almonds.
474,00:31:55,00:31:59,Cyanide crystals in the stomach lining.
475,00:31:59,00:32:04,"Yeah, any time you need a sniffer to detect it, my nose has the cyanide gene."
476,00:32:05,00:32:09,What gene turned your nose brown?
477,00:32:09,00:32:11,Go ahead. You can sew him up.
478,00:32:11,00:32:13,Will do.
479,00:32:13,00:32:15,"And I'll notify next of kin, too."
480,00:32:15,00:32:17,(chuckles)
481,00:32:18,00:32:19,Ugh.
482,00:32:19,00:32:20,GRISSOM: Cyanide is fast-acting.
483,00:32:20,00:32:26,"If it killed the squirrels before the crystals were dissolved completely in their stomachs, you'd expect the same thing with the Martins."
484,00:32:27,00:32:28,I saw the Martins' stomach contents.
485,00:32:28,00:32:29,There were no white crystals.
486,00:32:29,00:32:32,"Yeah, but maybe if it was ingested in a different manner."
487,00:32:32,00:32:33,Squirrels will eat anything.
488,00:32:33,00:32:37,"If the Martins drank it, then that would explain the absence of crystals."
489,00:32:37,00:32:40,I already have Henry running an expanded tox panel.
490,00:32:41,00:32:44,Any minute now.
491,00:32:44,00:32:47,It's cooking.
492,00:32:47,00:32:48,(beeping)
493,00:32:48,00:32:50,It's coming right up.
494,00:32:50,00:32:52,Yeah.
495,00:32:52,00:32:54,You hear Hodges is looking for his own apartment?
496,00:32:54,00:32:56,Cut the old apron strings.
497,00:32:56,00:32:58,"His mother finally kicked him out, huh?"
498,00:32:58,00:32:59,Good for her.
499,00:33:03,00:33:06,Lethal levels of cyanide.
500,00:33:06,00:33:08,You can't just walk into a hardware store and pick some up.
501,00:33:08,00:33:10,What about pest control companies?
502,00:33:10,00:33:11,Can they get it? Yeah.
503,00:33:11,00:33:16,"And mining companies, uh, electroplaters, photographers, jewelry makers."
504,00:33:16,00:33:18,"Thanks, Henry."
505,00:33:18,00:33:20,You can relax now.
506,00:33:23,00:33:25,(exhales)
507,00:33:27,00:33:29,"Look, is this going to take long?"
508,00:33:29,00:33:32,Depends on you.
509,00:33:32,00:33:35,'Cause I'm dealing with some really bad news.
510,00:33:35,00:33:38,I just found out my ex died last night.
511,00:33:38,00:33:40,I'm sorry.
512,00:33:40,00:33:43,"Yeah, apparently one of you guys blew him up with a stun gun."
513,00:33:43,00:33:45,Kyle Planck is your ex?
514,00:33:45,00:33:50,"Tell me, what is it that you two have against God's fur-covered creatures?"
515,00:33:50,00:33:51,Is this about that damn cat?
516,00:33:51,00:33:53,"For starters, yes."
517,00:33:55,00:33:58,"Look, I like cats, all right?"
518,00:33:58,00:34:00,It was an accident.
519,00:34:00,00:34:02,You can't just relocate ground squirrels.
520,00:34:02,00:34:04,Okay?
521,00:34:04,00:34:06,"I mean, they're... they're disgusting."
522,00:34:06,00:34:07,And I'm an artist.
523,00:34:07,00:34:10,I need a certain environment to work in.
524,00:34:10,00:34:13,Does this environment give you access to cyanide?
525,00:34:13,00:34:16,I use potassium cyanide in electroplating.
526,00:34:16,00:34:18,All my work is custom.
527,00:34:18,00:34:20,And also to poison ground squirrels?
528,00:34:20,00:34:23,I mixed a little with a can of tuna.
529,00:34:23,00:34:25,And I put it out back.
530,00:34:25,00:34:28,But only in my yard.
531,00:34:28,00:34:30,"All right, who knew the Martins' cat was going to find it?"
532,00:34:30,00:34:38,"What? Is that against the law? Actually, irresponsible use of poison isagainst the law, as well as killing ground squirrels and killing neighbors."
533,00:34:38,00:34:40,What?
534,00:34:40,00:34:43,I didn't... I didn't kill them.
535,00:34:45,00:34:47,"Look, we had neighbor issues."
536,00:34:49,00:34:53,Turn that damn thing off before I torch it! You're driving all your squirrels into my yard.
537,00:34:53,00:34:55,"All right, look, we're just trying to be humane here."
538,00:34:55,00:34:57,Now you use poison.
539,00:34:57,00:35:01,"And you-you killed Shrodinger. You should've kept your cat on your side of the fence, all right."
540,00:35:01,00:35:03,"You're causing this problem, not me."
541,00:35:03,00:35:04,Just leave us alone!
542,00:35:06,00:35:09,I killed the squirrels.
543,00:35:09,00:35:12,And possibly their cat.
544,00:35:12,00:35:14,But I am not a murderer.
545,00:35:18,00:35:20,(sniffing)
546,00:35:20,00:35:21,(exhaling)
547,00:35:21,00:35:23,(sniffing)
548,00:35:25,00:35:27,(exhaling)
549,00:35:27,00:35:30,(sniffing)
550,00:35:30,00:35:31,(exhaling)
551,00:35:33,00:35:34,I got nothing.
552,00:35:35,00:35:37,Try the bed.
553,00:35:41,00:35:43,(sniffing)
554,00:35:43,00:35:46,(laughs)
555,00:35:47,00:35:50,That's...
556,00:35:50,00:36:00,"Sorry. I was thinking of one of those, uh, bloodhounds in the old cartoons, ""Sniffing awound to find da wabbit."" (imitating Elmer Fudd laugh)"
557,00:36:00,00:36:01,This is a gift.
558,00:36:01,00:36:04,Don't make it cheap.
559,00:36:04,00:36:06,(sniffing)
560,00:36:08,00:36:10,Trail's gone cold.
561,00:36:10,00:36:13,"So, they died in this room."
562,00:36:13,00:36:15,In bed.
563,00:36:21,00:36:24,Give me a hand with the mattress.
564,00:36:40,00:36:44,"Now, get down and sniff the rug."
565,00:36:46,00:36:48,It's all they ever want.
566,00:36:52,00:36:54,(sniffing)
567,00:36:54,00:36:56,(exhaling)
568,00:36:56,00:36:58,Pay dirt.
569,00:37:04,00:37:07,"This carpet looks kind of new, right?"
570,00:37:07,00:37:10,Yeah.
571,00:37:23,00:37:25,Definitely some combustion there.
572,00:37:31,00:37:36,"It looks like they just laid the new carpet right on top of the old, which clearly limited the supply of oxygen."
573,00:37:36,00:37:41,The old carpet melted without bursting into flame.
574,00:37:44,00:37:50,"Ironically, older carpets contained polyvinyl chloride used as a flame retardant."
575,00:37:50,00:38:03,"So, when it got hot, it probably went into quantitative decomposition, which gave off gases, including hydrogen cyanide."
576,00:38:13,00:38:15,(coughing)
577,00:38:15,00:38:17,Field work dirty.
578,00:38:17,00:38:20,"Dirty, dirty, dirty."
579,00:38:21,00:38:23,(knocking wood)
580,00:38:23,00:38:24,(pounding wood)
581,00:38:29,00:38:32,(dog barking in distance)
582,00:38:47,00:38:50,Oh! Come on!
583,00:38:56,00:38:58,Your killer's a ground squirrel?
584,00:38:58,00:39:01,"In a way, I'd argue self-defense."
585,00:39:01,00:39:03,(gadget humming)
586,00:39:10,00:39:13,(squirrel chittering)
587,00:39:17,00:39:19,(chittering)
588,00:39:24,00:39:26,(buzzing)
589,00:39:26,00:39:27,It was an old house.
590,00:39:28,00:39:29,The wood had desiccated.
591,00:39:29,00:39:31,The short circuit smoldered into the floor joists.
592,00:39:34,00:39:36,(buzzing)
593,00:39:42,00:39:44,(popping)
594,00:39:44,00:39:46,(gases hissing)
595,00:39:50,00:39:54,Is it bad when you start thinking none of this sounds too weird anymore?
596,00:39:54,00:39:56,"Oh, it's a bit too freaky how these cases are connected."
597,00:39:56,00:39:59,"Grissom, you always say that there's no such thing as coincidence."
598,00:40:00,00:40:01,There isn't.
599,00:40:01,00:40:02,"WILLOWS: Oh, come on."
600,00:40:02,00:40:09,You got the guy that burst into flames just divorced from the woman who was fighting squirrel wars with the Martins.
601,00:40:09,00:40:12,SANDERS: Who had hired the exterminator whose drugs were turning everybody's blood green.
602,00:40:12,00:40:19,"STOKES: And one of his green-blooded customers was Evelyn, Our Lady of Tin Foil, the last person that Kyle Planck touched before he died."
603,00:40:19,00:40:21,There's one more connection.
604,00:40:21,00:40:23,Evelyn had 200 bucks.
605,00:40:23,00:40:27,"I'm thinking that when she was run over, she was on her way to buy more thiocyte."
606,00:40:27,00:40:33,"I think that Wayne Connor was with David Bohr, waiting for the money to arrive."
607,00:40:33,00:40:35,SANDERS: Only Evelyn never showed up.
608,00:40:35,00:40:38,"Connor lost his temper, and Bohr killed him in a fight."
609,00:40:38,00:40:42,And it all started with Kyle Planck-- lonely guy with a gut full of moonshine.
610,00:40:42,00:40:45,String theory.
611,00:40:45,00:40:46,Grissom theory.
612,00:40:47,00:40:48,This is better than a bedtime story.
613,00:40:48,00:40:54,"GRISSOM: String theory is ""the theory of everything."" Quantum mechanics tells us about the very small."
614,00:40:54,00:40:58,The theory of relativity explains the immense.
615,00:40:58,00:40:59,String theory ties it all together.
616,00:40:59,00:41:07,"It proposes that atomic particles are made up of infinitesimal, vibrating loops of energy-- or strings."
617,00:41:07,00:41:17,"Each string vibrates at its own frequency-- like on a violin, producing ""notes."" And these notes make up everything in the universe."
618,00:41:17,00:41:19,Cosmic symphony.
619,00:41:19,00:41:24,These strings have been combining and recombining ever since the big bang.
620,00:41:24,00:41:32,"So, the connections between our victims-- or any of us-- are not that extraordinary."
621,00:41:32,00:41:35,But every one of them thought they were alone.
622,00:41:35,00:41:38,BROWN: Too bad they didn't know about Grissom's theory.
623,00:41:38,00:41:41,"In a parallel universe, maybe they're all having breakfast together."
624,00:41:41,00:41:44,"In this universe, maybe we are."
625,00:41:44,00:41:45,STOKES: Yeah.
626,00:41:45,00:41:46,And you're buying.
627,00:41:47,00:41:50,No strings attached.
