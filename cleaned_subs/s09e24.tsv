0	00:01:52	00:02:15	Come again. ♪ Tell me quick ♪ BP's 90/70 and dropping.
1	00:02:15	00:02:16	What happened?
2	00:02:16	00:02:17	Guy was working a landscape gig.
3	00:02:17	00:02:20	They were trying to move a giant saguaro without using the right gear. (groans)
4	00:02:20	00:02:22	Fell over on him.
5	00:02:22	00:02:23	Any chance he's got insurance?
6	00:02:24	00:02:25	About the same chance he's a legal immigrant.
7	00:02:25	00:02:27	(gasping) No!
8	00:02:30	00:02:32	Whoa, whoa, whoa, e-easy.
9	00:02:32	00:02:33	You're not gonna need that right now, my friend.
10	00:02:33	00:02:35	EstÃ¡ bien. EstÃ¡ bien.
11	00:02:37	00:02:38	Gracias.
12	00:02:38	00:02:39	Dame, dame, dame, dame, dame...
13	00:02:42	00:02:46	Start oxygen, give him two milligrams of morphine and prep him for surgery.
14	00:02:49	00:02:52	Oh, so much for pro bono.
15	00:02:52	00:02:53	Got to go.
16	00:02:53	00:02:54	Day job's calling.
17	00:02:58	00:02:59	Chill out, Conrad.
18	00:02:59	00:03:02	You'll have it on your desk by the end of shift.
19	00:03:02	00:03:05	Yes, I've included a 10% cut across the board.
20	00:03:05	00:03:08	Just make sure there's 10% less crime, and we'll be fine.
21	00:03:10	00:03:11	What do we have here?
22	00:03:11	00:03:13	Business as usual.
23	00:03:14	00:03:15	Trucker spotted the body this morning.
24	00:03:15	00:03:19	TOD was sometime last night.
25	00:03:19	00:03:22	A single GSW to the back of the head.
26	00:03:22	00:03:24	Looks like a good-sized wound, I'd say medium caliber.
27	00:03:27	00:03:29	Sooting and stippling make it a close shot.
28	00:03:29	00:03:31	Execution, body dump?
29	00:03:31	00:03:33	That'd be my guess.
30	00:03:33	00:03:37	Looks like the car skidded to a halt here.
31	00:03:37	00:03:42	Killer dumped the body and then accelerated back up onto the road.
32	00:03:42	00:03:47	The body is well forward of the rear tire divots, about where the driver's door would be.
33	00:03:47	00:03:50	Which means the victim was probably behind the wheel.
34	00:04:02	00:04:03	Maybe he picked up the wrong hitchhiker.
35	00:04:04	00:04:06	Okay, ready to roll.
36	00:04:16	00:04:17	That's a lot of slogans.
37	00:04:18	00:04:19	Guess he liked advertising.
38	00:04:19	00:04:24	Wonder how he felt about epitaphs.
39	00:05:01	00:05:03	Ah, the '70s.
40	00:05:03	00:05:07	Recession, energy crisis, conflict in the Middle East.
41	00:05:07	00:05:08	My, how times have changed.
42	00:05:08	00:05:10	At least we don't have to put up with disco.
43	00:05:12	00:05:16	Looks like concrete dust under his nails.
44	00:05:16	00:05:18	Yeah, he seems to be covered with it.
45	00:05:21	00:05:22	It's even up his nose.
46	00:05:22	00:05:25	His hands are heavily callused.
47	00:05:25	00:05:26	I'm guessing construction worker.
48	00:05:29	00:05:31	Okay, he's not in AFIS.
49	00:05:31	00:05:33	Let's put him in the system.
50	00:05:42	00:05:51	So we have two distinct sets of shoe impressions leading away from the vehicle, neither of which belong to the victim.
51	00:05:51	00:05:52	So that means at least three people in the car.
52	00:05:54	00:05:55	These look like sneakers.
53	00:05:55	00:05:56	Mm-hmm.
54	00:05:56	00:05:59	The others, boots.
55	00:05:59	00:06:01	Let's see where they went.
56	00:06:36	00:06:40	The strides are all long, so they both must have been running.
57	00:06:40	00:06:43	Sneakers was limping, dragging his leg, bleeding, wounded.
58	00:06:45	00:06:47	I guess that means Boots had the gun.
59	00:06:47	00:06:54	Sneakers turns around, comes back, gets back in the car, takes off.
60	00:06:54	00:06:59	Boots heads back toward the road, disappears into the night.
61	00:06:59	00:07:02	I guess we're looking for a cowboy.
62	00:07:09	00:07:10	Hey, Nick.
63	00:07:10	00:07:11	Hey.
64	00:07:11	00:07:12	I'll see you next week.
65	00:07:12	00:07:13	Where are you off to?
66	00:07:13	00:07:16	Lee Goff's entomology workshop in Honolulu.
67	00:07:16	00:07:18	Entomology. Nice.
68	00:07:18	00:07:21	Wait, I thought Ecklie cut all funding for outside training.
69	00:07:21	00:07:26	Yeah, he did, but I've been waiting on this workshop for, like, a year, so if I got to go out of pocket, so be it.
70	00:07:26	00:07:29	We need a new bug man.
71	00:07:29	00:07:30	Hold down the fort.
72	00:07:30	00:07:32	Will do.
73	00:09:05	00:09:07	The bullet fragmented in his skull.
74	00:09:07	00:09:13	The lead core exited, but the copper jacket shed inside.
75	00:09:13	00:09:14	Cannelured.
76	00:09:14	00:09:16	Probably a .38 or .357 revolver.
77	00:09:16	00:09:17	Ah.
78	00:09:17	00:09:20	Did you recover that piece of his forehead?
79	00:09:21	00:09:23	Might save the mortician some spackle.
80	00:09:26	00:09:28	What's up with you?
81	00:09:28	00:09:30	Ah, things are tough all over.
82	00:09:32	00:09:35	Our vic's name is Huston Dobbs.
83	00:09:35	00:09:36	How'd you figure that out?
84	00:09:36	00:09:37	I didn't.
85	00:09:37	00:09:41	Brime County Sheriff's Department found a burnt-out car outside of Elba.
86	00:09:41	00:09:49	R.O. was in the wind, house foreclosed, etcetera, so they ran him through Missing Persons and matched him with our unknown DB.
87	00:09:49	00:09:52	They develop any leads in the case?
88	00:09:52	00:09:54	They told me where he was working.
89	00:10:10	00:10:12	Morning, sir.
90	00:10:13	00:10:16	Oh, good morning.
91	00:10:16	00:10:17	Booth or counter?
92	00:10:17	00:10:19	No, I need to speak to the manager.
93	00:10:19	00:10:21	I can do you one better than that.
94	00:10:21	00:10:22	I own the place.
95	00:10:22	00:10:23	What can I do for you?
96	00:10:23	00:10:24	Oh, uh...
97	00:10:25	00:10:28	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
98	00:10:28	00:10:30	Do you know this man?
99	00:10:30	00:10:31	Sure, I do.
100	00:10:31	00:10:34	Huston Dobbs. I give him employment here from time to time.
101	00:10:34	00:10:35	He's a fry cook.
102	00:10:35	00:10:39	He, uh, get himself in some kind of trouble?
103	00:10:39	00:10:41	Well, it's a little more serious than that, ma'am.
104	00:10:41	00:10:42	He's dead.
105	00:10:42	00:10:44	Oh, my Lord.
106	00:10:49	00:10:50	You get all that, Walter?
107	00:10:50	00:10:53	Because that's why I'm paying you, to stand there, right?
108	00:10:56	00:10:57	What did Huston do?
109	00:10:57	00:10:59	He get drunk again and run himself off the road?
110	00:10:59	00:11:00	No, he was shot.
111	00:11:01	00:11:02	Who'd want to shoot Huston?
112	00:11:02	00:11:04	Well, that's what I'm trying to find out.
113	00:11:04	00:11:06	When was the last time you saw him?
114	00:11:06	00:11:08	A couple of days ago, I guess.
115	00:11:08	00:11:09	Bruno's the one you want to talk to.
116	00:11:10	00:11:10	Oh, yeah?
117	00:11:11	00:11:12	Bruno? Bruno who?
118	00:11:12	00:11:13	Bruno Curtis.
119	00:11:13	00:11:15	Them two hung out together all the time.
120	00:11:15	00:11:17	And he didn't show up for work today either.
121	00:11:17	00:11:19	He's just one of those part-time guys. He...
122	00:11:19	00:11:22	He wasn't so part-time back in high school, Barbie.
123	00:11:22	00:11:25	You two tore it up pretty good, as I remember.
124	00:11:26	00:11:28	That was a long time ago, Clem.
125	00:11:28	00:11:32	You don't think Bruno's tied up in any of this, do you?
126	00:11:32	00:11:33	How can I find him?
127	00:11:33	00:11:34	I don't know.
128	00:11:34	00:11:36	He took a couple days off.
129	00:11:36	00:11:40	Said something about going up north looking for work.
130	00:11:40	00:11:43	Unskilled labor, no doubt. (raspy laugh)
131	00:11:44	00:11:50	I thought he worked here. Well, he does, but these days, sir, it just ain't enough to live on.
132	00:11:52	00:11:57	According to the deputy in Elba, the fire would have completely consumed the car...
133	00:11:58	00:12:01	...if it hadn't been for the weather.
134	00:12:06	00:12:10	So unlike Huston Dobbs, we seem to have caught a break.
135	00:12:11	00:12:13	Toothbrush.
136	00:12:15	00:12:17	Razor.
137	00:12:22	00:12:23	Lavatory.
138	00:12:23	00:12:25	Guy must have been living in his car.
139	00:12:25	00:12:27	It is a Chrysler LeBaron.
140	00:12:27	00:12:29	A babe magnet.
141	00:12:30	00:12:31	You should make an offer.
142	00:12:33	00:12:37	Um, I think it's safe to say that the victim did not drive this thing back to town.
143	00:12:37	00:12:39	Agreed.
144	00:12:40	00:12:42	Thank you.
145	00:12:47	00:12:48	Oh, hey...
146	00:12:51	00:12:53	This looks like a piece of skull.
147	00:12:53	00:12:57	We know the last thing that went through his mind was a copper-jacketed .38.
148	00:12:57	00:13:00	These keys are pretty charred.
149	00:13:00	00:13:03	I doubt Mandy's going to get any prints off them.
150	00:13:06	00:13:07	It's an old Hux Club casino chip.
151	00:13:07	00:13:11	Hampton Huxley, the dead porno mag guy?
152	00:13:11	00:13:14	It's not porno, it's a lifestyle.
153	00:13:14	00:13:24	For one brief, shining moment in the 80's, scantily clad Hux Club Kittens serving cocktails and dealing blackjack was the pinnacle of Las Vegas high society.
154	00:13:24	00:13:26	How'd you get in?
155	00:13:26	00:13:29	Sadly, only through the glossy pages of the magazine. Hmm.
156	00:13:29	00:13:32	Which I purchased for the articles. Okay.
157	00:13:34	00:13:36	Wendy, I got blood on the backseat.
158	00:13:36	00:13:37	Okay.
159	00:13:41	00:13:44	Along with something else.
160	00:13:48	00:13:50	.22 L-R.
161	00:13:50	00:13:52	A peashooter round.
162	00:13:52	00:13:54	So there are actually two guns involved.
163	00:13:54	00:13:55	Yeah.
164	00:13:55	00:13:56	And I've got one of them.
165	00:13:56	00:13:58	Hodges.
166	00:13:58	00:13:59	Relax.
167	00:14:00	00:14:01	It's just a belt buckle.
168	00:14:01	00:14:02	For people who love guns.
169	00:14:02	00:14:04	I love guns.
170	00:14:15	00:14:18	There's a print here etched into the metal.
171	00:14:18	00:14:25	Salts and amino acids from fingerprint oil can chemically etch metal over time.
172	00:14:25	00:14:27	Heat greatly accelerates the process.
173	00:14:27	00:14:31	You sometimes see it in arson investigations.
174	00:14:32	00:14:35	The print belongs to Wiley Schindler.
175	00:14:35	00:14:37	He's in the system off a work card.
176	00:14:37	00:14:39	This buckle looks so familiar.
177	00:14:41	00:14:43	Is this a Vanderfield Arms mini .22?
178	00:14:43	00:14:44	Why, yes, it is.
179	00:14:44	00:14:48	It's a concealable revolver.
180	00:14:48	00:14:50	Perfect for the man who trusts no one.
181	00:14:50	00:14:52	My dad had one.
182	00:14:52	00:14:54	Schindler's address is listed as Kansas City.
183	00:14:54	00:14:56	He's a collectables dealer.
184	00:14:56	00:14:58	I Googled him.
185	00:14:58	00:15:05	I'll be hightailing it to Las Vegas from May 11 to the 18th for the World Collectables Trade Fair at The Green Valley Ranch.
186	00:15:05	00:15:08	If you want to sit down to talk turkey, give me a call.
187	00:15:08	00:15:10	What do you know, he's in town.
188	00:15:10	00:15:12	I'm ready to talk turkey.
189	00:15:14	00:15:26	Yes, sir, those are the original crystal doorknobs handpicked by Bugsy Siegel himself for the bathroom suite that he personally customized for Lana Turner at the Flamingo, back in 1945.
190	00:15:26	00:15:32	Now think about it-- Lana had to be naked as a jaybird when she fondled those knobs.
191	00:15:32	00:15:35	You have exquisite taste.
192	00:15:35	00:15:40	I'm prepared to let you have the entire set for-- oh, let me see, uh...
193	00:15:40	00:15:41	Oh, thank you, darling.
194	00:15:42	00:15:43	Wiley Schindler?
195	00:15:43	00:15:45	That I am. Just give us a moment, friend.
196	00:15:45	00:15:46	Doing a little business here.
197	00:15:47	00:15:48	So are we. We need to talk.
198	00:15:48	00:15:50	Nice boots.
199	00:15:50	00:15:51	Thank you. I just got 'em.
200	00:15:51	00:15:53	You looking for a pair? Excuse me.
201	00:15:57	00:15:59	You know these two guys?
202	00:15:59	00:16:01	Can't say I know 'em well.
203	00:16:01	00:16:02	Just met 'em the other day.
204	00:16:02	00:16:03	Where and how?
205	00:16:04	00:16:06	A little greasy spoon in Elba.
206	00:16:06	00:16:11	I just pulled in to get some grub.
207	00:16:11	00:16:14	And much to my surprise, I saw something there I liked.
208	00:16:17	00:16:22	I told her I admired her earrings and asked her if there was any more where those came from.
209	00:16:22	00:16:24	She said she'd make a call.
210	00:16:25	00:16:27	So there's 200 chips in here.
211	00:16:27	00:16:29	300 bucks, you can have the whole kit and caboodle.
212	00:16:29	00:16:31	We ain't taking a penny less.
213	00:16:31	00:16:34	I don't know, fellas. That's a lot of money.
214	00:16:34	00:16:38	See, you got to make the other fella think he's getting over on you.
215	00:16:38	00:16:41	My wife and I got married at the Hux and, now...
216	00:16:41	00:16:43	You do not want to go cheap on your wife.
217	00:16:43	00:16:45	Loretta's gone.
218	00:16:45	00:16:47	The chips are just for me.
219	00:16:47	00:16:52	See, I knew we were going to settle on a dollar a chip the minute they opened their mouths.
220	00:16:52	00:16:53	200.
221	00:16:53	00:16:55	That's a buck apiece. You got a deal.
222	00:16:55	00:16:57	Let 'em see your pain.
223	00:16:57	00:16:59	Make 'em feel good, and then...
224	00:16:59	00:17:02	Okay, deal.
225	00:17:02	00:17:07	There's few things in life that'll make an old man's nipples hard, and that qualifies.
226	00:17:07	00:17:09	You tell 'em you're a collectables dealer?
227	00:17:09	00:17:11	It never came up.
228	00:17:11	00:17:13	That's the last time I saw either one of them.
229	00:17:13	00:17:15	Just out of curiosity, what would you say the chips are worth?
230	00:17:15	00:17:17	Whatever the market will bear.
231	00:17:18	00:17:20	Well, it is pretty much a bear market these days.
232	00:17:20	00:17:22	So this guy's dead...
233	00:17:22	00:17:25	and this guy's turning out to be pretty hard to find.
234	00:17:25	00:17:28	Maybe this guy killed that one and then took a powder.
235	00:17:29	00:17:32	Or maybe you killed this guy and chased this guy away.
236	00:17:32	00:17:34	You can't be serious.
237	00:17:34	00:17:38	We did find the belt buckle of your concealed .22 at the scene.
238	00:17:39	00:17:42	Well, they admired it-- big, handsome thing that it is.
239	00:17:42	00:17:44	So I gave it to 'em to seal the deal.
240	00:17:44	00:17:46	Well, I'm making you a new deal.
241	00:17:46	00:17:48	You're under arrest.
242	00:17:58	00:18:04	When the Hux Club opened in 1981, it was as if the great men's magazine had come to life.
243	00:18:04	00:18:09	But like all gardens in paradise, it couldn't last long here on Earth.
244	00:18:09	00:18:15	Hux had a falling out with his partners and pulled out of the venture, taking all his trademarks with him.
245	00:18:15	00:18:26	They remodeled the casino, but without Hux and his Kittens to bring the bang, so to speak, the New Babylon, as they renamed it, died a quick and painful death.
246	00:18:26	00:18:33	Now according to the gaming commission records, all of the chips from the Hux Club were destroyed.
247	00:18:33	00:18:35	Well, it's the law when you close a casino.
248	00:18:35	00:18:39	When Sam imploded the Rampart, he buried all the old chips in the foundation of the Eclipse.
249	00:18:39	00:18:42	Which is precisely why surviving chips become collectables.
250	00:18:42	00:18:50	You throw in a Hampton Huxley aura and you have got an item that auctions for up to $10,000 in mint condition.
251	00:18:50	00:18:53	Apparently there's less than a dozen of these in existence.
252	00:18:53	00:18:55	Until today.
253	00:18:56	00:19:01	We recovered these from Wiley Schindler's hotel room.
254	00:19:01	00:19:06	172 chips-- and $50,000 in cash.
255	00:19:09	00:19:11	So I spoke to some people at the trade show.
256	00:19:11	00:19:14	Said that you sold more than a few Hux chips to a bunch of different collectors.
257	00:19:14	00:19:17	I wasn't aware you could put a man in jail for that.
258	00:19:17	00:19:19	You're in jail 'cause I think you're a killer.
259	00:19:19	00:19:20	Which I'm not.
260	00:19:20	00:19:22	Let's agree to disagree, okay?
261	00:19:22	00:19:33	You know, for about 30 years, some people who care about these things had to be consoled because there were so few of these casino chips from the famed Hux Club in existence.
262	00:19:34	00:19:35	And then you show up with a couple hundred of them.
263	00:19:35	00:19:37	I told you how I got those.
264	00:19:37	00:19:38	Here's what I think happened.
265	00:19:38	00:19:44	I think you and Bruno and Huston cooked up a scheme to put some counterfeit chips in circulation.
266	00:19:44	00:19:47	I never sold anything to anybody that wasn't what I said it was.
267	00:19:47	00:19:50	So you end up in the car going out to the desert.
268	00:19:50	00:19:51	Somebody says something, somebody doesn't say something.
269	00:19:51	00:19:53	Things get weird.
270	00:19:53	00:19:56	And a guy gets a bullet hole in his head.
271	00:19:58	00:19:59	That ring a bell?
272	00:19:59	00:20:01	Not even a tinkle.
273	00:20:01	00:20:05	Do you see a lawyer in here with me?
274	00:20:05	00:20:09	That's because I'm trying to talk to you man to man.
275	00:20:09	00:20:10	I didn't kill anybody.
276	00:20:11	00:20:12	I didn't cheat anybody.
277	00:20:12	00:20:16	And the sooner you figure that out the sooner you can stop wasting both our time.
278	00:20:46	00:20:56	Micro-FTIR confirms that they are compression-molded clay with impressed stainless steel inlays, consistent with the specs from the gaming commission.
279	00:20:56	00:21:00	They're authentic Hux Club chips...
280	00:21:00	00:21:01	Sorry.
281	00:21:01	00:21:05	They were manufactured with state-of-the-art anti-counterfeiting technology from 1981.
282	00:21:05	00:21:12	So Bruno and Huston must've found these tucked away in the attic or daddy's old trunk.
283	00:21:12	00:21:15	You never know what people keep for sentimental reasons.
284	00:21:15	00:21:18	Yeah, but why keep that many?
285	00:21:18	00:21:20	Even at face value, they were worth thousands.
286	00:21:20	00:21:28	In any case, if Schindler got authentic Hux Club chips from those guys for cheap, he'd have no reason to kill either one of them.
287	00:21:28	00:21:31	So where are we on Bruno?
288	00:21:31	00:21:35	The deputies have been sitting on his house and the diner.
289	00:21:35	00:21:36	He's a no-show.
290	00:21:36	00:21:40	And no gunshot wound victims matching his description have showed up at any of the hospitals.
291	00:21:40	00:21:43	Well, this isn't a guy with a whole lot of resources.
292	00:21:43	00:21:45	Is there any other places he might be?
293	00:21:46	00:21:51	According to Brass, both Huston and Bruno were doing odd construction- destruction jobs around town.
294	00:21:51	00:21:54	I suppose he could be hiding out at a work site.
295	00:21:54	00:21:57	So what do you want to do, drive around Elba?
296	00:21:57	00:21:59	Get out every time we see a bulldozer?
297	00:21:59	00:22:01	The Bluebird Button Company.
298	00:22:01	00:22:03	The what?
299	00:22:03	00:22:04	The Bluebird Button Company.
300	00:22:05	00:22:05	It's in Elba.
301	00:22:06	00:22:08	They made the Hux Club chips.
302	00:22:08	00:22:17	The company was primarily in the pin-back button business, but it was the only company in the western United States to be able to produce metal-clay inlays.
303	00:22:17	00:22:18	They went bankrupt way back.
304	00:22:18	00:22:21	That factory's been abandoned for years.
305	00:22:55	00:22:57	I'll lead this time?
306	00:23:18	00:23:20	Someone's been living here.
307	00:23:24	00:23:26	Yellow exudate.
308	00:23:26	00:23:30	Someone's nursing a badly-infected wound.
309	00:23:30	00:23:31	There!
310	00:23:42	00:23:44	Go, go! I'll call it in.
311	00:23:44	00:23:49	Control, Officer Crawford. Requesting a one-unit backup.
312	00:23:49	00:23:51	Officer two-one, we have units in the vicinity.
313	00:23:51	00:23:52	Will notify.
314	00:24:32	00:24:36	Looks like he disappeared into thin air.
315	00:24:36	00:24:38	Yeah, it's like we're chasing a ghost.
316	00:24:46	00:24:47	Drop the gun!
317	00:24:47	00:24:50	I said drop the gun!
318	00:24:50	00:24:53	Drop the gun or I'll shoot!
319	00:24:53	00:24:55	Ray, stop!
320	00:24:55	00:24:58	This man needs medical attention.
321	00:24:58	00:25:00	Call it in.
322	00:25:00	00:25:04	Control, this is Charlie-zero-seven-Adams.
323	00:25:04	00:25:08	I have a 421. Roll paramedics to my location.
324	00:25:08	00:25:12	Copy that, oh-seven. Paramedics en route.
325	00:25:38	00:25:41	There's gold in them there button factory parking lots.
326	00:25:41	00:25:46	Or at least there was until Schindler started slipping his chips into the market.
327	00:25:46	00:25:50	The collectible price has dropped 40% over the last 24 hours.
328	00:25:50	00:25:55	Okay, so you're telling me that this hole in the ground was filled with Hux Club chips?
329	00:25:55	00:25:57	That's our theory.
330	00:25:57	00:26:01	When Hampton Huxley pulled out of the casino, the state had to destroy all the chips.
331	00:26:02	00:26:05	107,423, according to the gaming commission.
332	00:26:05	00:26:09	About 50 cubic feet worth.
333	00:26:09	00:26:11	Hole was plenty big enough for that.
334	00:26:11	00:26:14	And they were all sent back to the Bluebird Button Company for destruction.
335	00:26:14	00:26:15	Why?
336	00:26:15	00:26:20	Well, apparently, there was a clause in the original manufacturing contract that obligated them to do it.
337	00:26:21	00:26:26	Because of the way the chips were made, they would've been extremely hard to destroy.
338	00:26:26	00:26:27	Brutal on the machines.
339	00:26:27	00:26:29	So somebody probably figured, why bother?
340	00:26:33	00:26:41	They dig a hole, they fill it with the chips, put a layer of shreds on top of it, and then seal it with a layer of concrete.
341	00:26:41	00:26:43	Nobody ever would've known.
342	00:26:46	00:26:53	If it hadn't been for a couple of down-on-their-luck guys who finally got lucky.
343	00:27:00	00:27:02	How is he?
344	00:27:02	00:27:05	As well as you could expect, under the circumstances.
345	00:27:05	00:27:07	Brass was in there with him for half an hour.
346	00:27:07	00:27:08	The guy didn't say a word.
347	00:27:08	00:27:11	That was a really stupid thing that you did back there.
348	00:27:11	00:27:14	He could've shot you. I could have shot you.
349	00:27:14	00:27:15	He needed help.
350	00:27:15	00:27:17	He had a gun in his hand.
351	00:27:17	00:27:20	I didn't stop being a doctor when I became a CSI.
352	00:27:20	00:27:25	Well, if you keep treating suspects like patients, you're gonna get yourself or someone else killed.
353	00:27:37	00:27:39	Things aren't looking too good for you, Bruno.
354	00:27:39	00:27:42	We have your shoe treads in the desert.
355	00:27:42	00:27:48	And when we run your DNA against the blood we found in the backseat of your friend's car, that's gonna come back to you, too.
356	00:27:48	00:27:52	Best you can hope for is accessory to murder.
357	00:27:52	00:27:56	But I guess the detective told you all of this.
358	00:27:59	00:28:02	Those are phantom pains.
359	00:28:02	00:28:04	They'll pass, after a while.
360	00:28:04	00:28:06	How would you know that?
361	00:28:06	00:28:08	Because I'm a physician.
362	00:28:11	00:28:14	And I also work at the Crime Lab.
363	00:28:14	00:28:18	You're that guy that jumped into the hole with me.
364	00:28:21	00:28:22	Why did you do that?
365	00:28:23	00:28:24	You looked like you needed help.
366	00:28:25	00:28:28	Would you like to tell me what happened that night?
367	00:28:28	00:28:30	I'll believe you.
368	00:28:30	00:28:36	Just between you and me, the day you walk into court with one leg, the jury will want to believe you, too.
369	00:28:36	00:28:42	But you have to tell me what happened, and it has to be the truth.
370	00:28:50	00:28:54	I wish we'd never pulled those stupid chips out of that hole.
371	00:28:56	00:29:02	Huston and me got hired to bust up this parking lot at the old factory.
372	00:29:02	00:29:07	It was a cash deal, off the books.
373	00:29:07	00:29:11	That's how we found 'em.
374	00:29:11	00:29:14	We figured they had to be worthless.
375	00:29:14	00:29:17	Otherwise, why would somebody just dump 'em like that, right?
376	00:29:17	00:29:22	We still had to get rid of them, so we gathered 'em all up and...
377	00:29:22	00:29:29	But that Hux Club chick was pretty cool, so we kept 'em for souvenirs, gifts.
378	00:29:29	00:29:34	I knew Barbie would like it for her arts and crafts and stuff.
379	00:29:36	00:29:43	Anyway, about a week and a half later, Barbie called me and said she had some guy over at the diner that wanted to buy some chips.
380	00:29:43	00:29:48	So Huston and me loaded up a box and we went down there.
381	00:29:48	00:29:51	That Schindler dude gave us a buck apiece.
382	00:29:51	00:29:59	Me and Huston, we pulled thousands of those things out of that... out of that hole, so we're thinking, Holy Mother...
383	00:29:59	00:30:03	we're rich! (chuckles)
384	00:30:03	00:30:06	But then when we went down there the next morning...
385	00:30:12	00:30:18	That son of a bitch Schindler had swiped 'em right out from under our noses.
386	00:30:18	00:30:22	He left us his phone number in case we had any more chips to sell.
387	00:30:22	00:30:25	So we called him up and we said we did.
388	00:30:25	00:30:32	And we met him in Vegas, and we told him we wanted our chips back.
389	00:30:32	00:30:35	Lying bastard denied everything.
390	00:30:35	00:30:37	So you took him for a ride.
391	00:30:45	00:30:47	Those chips are ours.
392	00:30:47	00:30:48	You gonna show us where you put 'em...
393	00:30:48	00:30:52	(gun cocks) nobody gets hurt.
394	00:30:53	00:30:55	Little late for that, boy.
395	00:31:00	00:31:07	We ran the car off the road and Schindler got away.
396	00:31:07	00:31:13	I tried to chase after him, but 'cause of my leg and all...
397	00:31:13	00:31:17	Schindler killed Huston.
398	00:31:19	00:31:21	He shot my best friend down.
399	00:32:09	00:32:10	Two shots.
400	00:32:55	00:33:01	The .38 revolver in Bruno Curtis' possession fired the bullet that killed Huston Dobbs.
401	00:33:01	00:33:02	No surprise there.
402	00:33:03	00:33:07	No, but according to Mandy, the only prints on the weapon belong to Bruno Curtis.
403	00:33:07	00:33:09	Schindler's prints weren't even on the weapon?
404	00:33:09	00:33:11	No.
405	00:33:11	00:33:20	So, despite Bruno's statement, and even though the belt buckle could place Schindler in the car, the only direct murder evidence we have implicates Bruno.
406	00:33:21	00:33:24	I guess those boots were made for walkin'.
407	00:33:24	00:33:30	I'm just happy to be free and, uh, I'm very pleased that justice was served.
408	00:33:30	00:33:33	Oh, and, uh, I wanna warn any collectors that might be out there.
409	00:33:33	00:33:39	Don't be taken by anybody trying to sell you any rare collectible Hux Club chips.
410	00:33:39	00:33:42	There's thousands of those things out there.
411	00:33:42	00:33:45	To a collector they're not worth a plug nickel. Thank you.
412	00:33:45	00:33:48	The collectibles trader was released from custody earlier today.
413	00:33:48	00:33:54	One man loses his life and another one loses his leg, and all for worthless pieces of clay.
414	00:33:54	00:33:56	What are you gonna do?
415	00:33:56	00:34:01	So, um, Riley thinks that you're a little reckless.
416	00:34:01	00:34:04	And I think she's a little trigger-happy.
417	00:34:05	00:34:11	Catherine, Ray, this is Clayton Ferris from the gaming commission.
418	00:34:11	00:34:17	As you are aware, the Hux Club chips were supposed to have been destroyed 28 years ago.
419	00:34:17	00:34:20	But it was never officially verified.
420	00:34:20	00:34:32	In any event, since the disposal was improperly carried out, the existing chips continue to be bearer instruments and the State of Nevada is on the line for their face value.
421	00:34:32	00:34:37	You mean anyone holding those chips can just walk in and trade them in for cash?
422	00:34:37	00:34:39	Wait a minute.
423	00:34:39	00:34:44	The window for all chip redemptions is 120 days from the original recall.
424	00:34:44	00:34:52	The... attorneys who drafted the original Hux Club contract apparently left that provision out.
425	00:34:52	00:34:59	The Great State of Nevada, of course, will honor its obligation to redeem the chips.
426	00:34:59	00:35:10	However, the argument can be made that the chips are, in fact, stolen property and still outstanding evidence in a murder investigation.
427	00:35:10	00:35:13	So, you want us to find the chips before anyone else does and tries to cash them in.
428	00:35:13	00:35:18	We feel that that would be in the best interests of all concerned.
429	00:35:22	00:35:24	Yeah, what's up, professor?
430	00:35:24	00:35:25	Have you talked to Wiley Schindler yet?
431	00:35:25	00:35:26	No, we're looking for him.
432	00:35:26	00:35:28	He checked out of the hotel, he wasn't at the trade show.
433	00:35:28	00:35:31	If he left town with the chips, he's got a big head start.
434	00:35:31	00:35:33	Did Barbie from the coffee shop say anything?
435	00:35:33	00:35:35	No, I, uh...
436	00:35:35	00:35:39	just arrived at her house about 15 minutes ago.
437	00:35:39	00:35:43	And, unfortunately...
438	00:35:43	00:35:45	She's not talking.
439	00:36:05	00:36:08	Single large-caliber GSW.
440	00:36:08	00:36:10	There's no lividity; she's been dead less than an hour.
441	00:36:10	00:36:13	You must've just missed the bad guy.
442	00:36:13	00:36:16	She's got defensive wounds on her arms.
443	00:36:16	00:36:19	I found a box of .44-caliber shells, six were missing.
444	00:36:19	00:36:21	Haven't found the weapon yet.
445	00:36:21	00:36:25	There were no signs of forced entry, which suggests that she knew her killer.
446	00:36:25	00:36:27	Yeah, but it looks like a robbery.
447	00:36:27	00:36:29	To steal what?
448	00:36:29	00:36:32	Everybody outside of the gaming commission and the Crime Lab thinks that (phone ringing)
449	00:36:32	00:36:34	these chips are worthless.
450	00:36:34	00:36:35	Jim?
451	00:36:36	00:36:39	Okay.
452	00:36:39	00:36:42	Thank you.
453	00:36:42	00:36:47	P.D. just picked up Wiley Schindler at McCarran trying to board a plane back to Kansas City.
454	00:36:47	00:36:52	His carry-ons were packed with two cases of Hux Club chips.
455	00:36:52	00:36:54	And we let him out the door.
456	00:36:54	00:36:57	Well, I'm going back to the lab.
457	00:36:57	00:36:59	Why don't you finish up here?
458	00:37:09	00:37:12	So, tell me something, Wiley.
459	00:37:12	00:37:15	Where'd you get the chips this time?
460	00:37:15	00:37:19	From that gal at the diner-- Miss, um, Aubrey.
461	00:37:19	00:37:22	I went by her place this morning, made a fair deal for them.
462	00:37:22	00:37:26	You know, her buds, you know, you remember Stumpy and Hole-in-the-Head.
463	00:37:26	00:37:28	They were the ones who found them.
464	00:37:28	00:37:30	So, what made you think Barbie had any?
465	00:37:30	00:37:32	Because she was their bud.
466	00:37:32	00:37:36	I figured she might know where the stash was.
467	00:37:36	00:37:42	And I have a sentimental attachment to the Hux Club era, so... Come on, man, don't lie to me.
468	00:37:42	00:37:43	You're not a sentimental guy.
469	00:37:45	00:37:48	Okay, I've got a friend in the gaming commission.
470	00:37:48	00:37:53	And I heard that the chips might still have cash value with the state. Right...
471	00:37:53	00:37:59	So, you went to Barbie and got all the high denomination ones before she found out what they were worth, right?
472	00:37:59	00:38:00	Yeah.
473	00:38:00	00:38:02	So what?
474	00:38:02	00:38:04	So, she's dead.
475	00:38:05	00:38:10	When I left her, she was smiling and holding $2,000 in cash.
476	00:38:10	00:38:12	You got a knack for making dead people happy.
477	00:38:12	00:38:16	I put my damn business card on the bank roll.
478	00:38:16	00:38:20	If I killed her, why in the hell would I do that?
479	00:38:20	00:38:24	Hey, Catherine, I got something you'll want to see.
480	00:38:24	00:38:27	Remember those online auctions we were tracking? Yeah.
481	00:38:27	00:38:32	Well, a significant number of Hux Club chips were put on the market while Schindler was still in custody.
482	00:38:32	00:38:34	I know that Barbie Aubrey had some.
483	00:38:34	00:38:35	It was probably her.
484	00:38:35	00:38:37	That's what I thought, too.
485	00:38:37	00:38:41	So, I checked in with a couple people at the collectibles show to confirm.
486	00:38:41	00:38:47	Nobody recognized Barbie, but several described a man-- not Schindler-- who was peddling Hux Club chips.
487	00:38:47	00:38:49	This is surveillance video from the venue.
488	00:38:49	00:38:54	The guy on the left was apparently there for hours.
489	00:38:54	00:38:57	Eventually made several cash sales.
490	00:38:57	00:38:59	Any idea who he is?
491	00:38:59	00:39:01	No, but...
492	00:39:01	00:39:05	lucky for us, he paid his bar tab with his credit card.
493	00:39:05	00:39:07	No, I got units on it.
494	00:39:07	00:39:09	Hello?
495	00:39:32	00:39:36	I don't care who called in sick, you can't just change the schedule on me at the last minute.
496	00:39:36	00:39:39	I'm in Vegas on business, like I told you.
497	00:39:39	00:39:41	Stop hounding me!
498	00:39:51	00:39:54	All right, his name is Walter Ellis.
499	00:39:54	00:39:58	He's a busboy at the diner.
500	00:39:58	00:40:01	Well, the address on this statement is the same as Barbie's.
501	00:40:01	00:40:04	They live together?
502	00:40:04	00:40:07	Or they're married.
503	00:40:07	00:40:10	Maybe Schindler was telling the truth the whole time.
504	00:40:10	00:40:16	What if Barbie stole the chips from Bruno and Huston and Walter then stole them from her?
505	00:40:18	00:40:19	What are you doing?
506	00:40:19	00:40:21	These are my chips, moron!
507	00:40:21	00:40:22	They're half mine, you bitch!
508	00:40:23	00:40:25	No, they're not! You're an idiot!
509	00:42:10	00:42:12	13 years of living with that bitch!
510	00:42:13	00:42:16	I'm getting out!
