0	00:00:01	00:00:05	Previously on CSI... I talked to that lawyer-- he's arranging a meeting with the FBI.
1	00:00:05	00:00:08	I haven't seen Laura in two weeks, since she talked to the lawyer you sent her to.
2	00:00:08	00:00:10	The hit was professional.
3	00:00:10	00:00:11	Clean-up was professional, too.
4	00:00:11	00:00:13	You remember Special Agents Pratt and McQuaid?
5	00:00:13	00:00:14	I'll be with her the whole time.
6	00:00:14	00:00:16	You got my friend killed!
7	00:00:16	00:00:18	How could you let this happen?
8	00:00:20	00:00:21	Get in.
9	00:00:43	00:00:45	Hey, Russell...
10	00:00:51	00:00:53	Hey, D.B., it's Nick.
11	00:00:53	00:00:59	Listen, I got a lead on the money trail from Mark Gabriel's company to his hit squad via the Swiss bank account.
12	00:00:59	00:01:03	So, you need to call me back so I can fill you in, all right?
13	00:01:03	00:01:05	(beeps) Hey, Sara.
14	00:01:05	00:01:08	You seen Catherine? No. You probably won't for a few days.
15	00:01:08	00:01:09	What do you mean? You haven't heard?
16	00:01:09	00:01:12	Heard what? Laura Gabriel was murdered in FBI custody.
17	00:01:12	00:01:14	Well, how'd that happen?
18	00:01:14	00:01:16	One of Mark Gabriel's hit squad infiltrated the protection detail.
19	00:01:16	00:01:18	McQuaid and three other agents were killed.
20	00:01:18	00:01:23	Catherine went off on Agent Pratt at the crime scene, and Russell sent her home to cool off. Yeah, where is Russell?
21	00:01:23	00:01:27	(phone rings) Call out, downtown motel-- I saw him hightail it out of here.
22	00:01:27	00:01:29	Stokes.
23	00:01:29	00:01:30	Yeah, yeah, we're looking for him right now.
24	00:01:30	00:01:32	Okay, we'll handle it.
25	00:01:32	00:01:36	What now? Got a 434, shots fired at the corner of Jupiter and Fairwick.
26	00:01:36	00:01:37	20 minutes ago.
27	00:01:37	00:01:40	Southern Highlands? That's Catherine's neighborhood.
28	00:01:40	00:01:44	I got a bad feeling about this.
29	00:01:47	00:01:48	Hey.
30	00:01:48	00:01:50	Why'd you guys call me over to Catherine's house?
31	00:01:50	00:01:52	434 is five blocks that way.
32	00:01:52	00:01:55	We've been trying to reach her. She's MIA.
33	00:01:55	00:01:56	Nick...
34	00:01:59	00:02:05	Five-point-seven. That's the same caliber Gabriel's guys use. What do you want to bet somebody called in the wrong address, bought themselves some time?
35	00:02:12	00:02:14	Catherine?
36	00:02:15	00:02:17	Hey, Catherine?
37	00:02:21	00:02:22	Doorknob's been wiped clean.
38	00:02:22	00:02:24	There's not a speck of dust.
39	00:02:24	00:02:25	I smell ethanol.
40	00:02:25	00:02:28	Just like Malcolm Turner's law office.
41	00:02:34	00:02:36	Bullet hole.
42	00:02:36	00:02:38	Frame's been repaired.
43	00:02:38	00:02:40	So has the bookcase here.
44	00:02:49	00:02:51	Catherine's backup gun is gone. Well, that's good.
45	00:02:51	00:02:52	Right? I mean, that means that she had time to get it, right?
46	00:02:52	00:02:55	(phone ringing) That she needs it is bad.
47	00:02:55	00:02:57	Stokes.
48	00:02:58	00:03:00	Oh, no.
49	00:03:00	00:03:02	Okay, we're 10-39.
50	00:03:02	00:03:06	Patrol spotted Russell's SUV abandoned near the 215.
51	00:03:06	00:03:07	That's a couple of blocks from his motel call-out.
52	00:03:07	00:03:09	And they said it's all shot to hell.
53	00:03:16	00:03:17	Doesn't look good.
54	00:03:17	00:03:19	There's blood in the backseat.
55	00:03:19	00:03:20	A lot of it.
56	00:03:23	00:03:26	Dispatch couldn't get Russell on his cell phone.
57	00:03:26	00:03:28	The walkie's still in the car.
58	00:03:28	00:03:30	Blood trail... heads off that way.
59	00:03:30	00:03:34	Well, we found a 5.7 shell casing outside of Catherine's house.
60	00:03:34	00:03:39	We also smelled ethanol inside-- evidence pointing to a shootout, but the place was cleaned up.
61	00:03:39	00:03:41	It's got Gabriel's hit squad written all over it.
62	00:03:41	00:03:43	There's no Catherine.
63	00:03:43	00:03:44	Russell's unreachable.
64	00:03:44	00:03:49	There's blood in the backseat, none in the front.
65	00:03:49	00:03:51	Maybe Catherine was wounded.
66	00:03:51	00:03:53	Russell was coming to her aid.
67	00:03:53	00:03:54	But why didn't they call it in?
68	00:03:54	00:03:58	On the run, guys shooting at them-- maybe they didn't have time.
69	00:03:58	00:04:01	Maybe they didn't think it was safe to use their cell phones.
70	00:04:01	00:04:08	If this is Gabriel's black ops boys, they have all kinds of toys to hack our communications and listen in.
71	00:04:08	00:04:10	Who you calling?
72	00:04:19	00:04:20	It's Catherine's cell.
73	00:04:20	00:04:23	They ditched their phones.
74	00:04:32	00:04:34	It's Russell's cell phone.
75	00:04:37	00:04:39	Oh, man, it's his wife calling.
76	00:04:42	00:04:43	I'll take that.
77	00:04:43	00:04:48	(ringing continues) This is your crime scene...
78	00:04:48	00:04:51	but this is my call.
79	00:04:54	00:04:57	Mrs. Russell...
80	00:04:57	00:04:59	this is Jim Brass.
81	00:05:33	00:05:35	Yeah, and hey, get me a flatbed down here as soon as possible.
82	00:05:35	00:05:38	I got to get this Denali back to the garage.
83	00:05:38	00:05:40	Yeah.
84	00:05:40	00:05:42	Hey, I got to take this.
85	00:05:42	00:05:43	All right.
86	00:05:45	00:05:47	Morgan, listen, there's been a little change of plans.
87	00:05:47	00:05:49	The Denali scene is now Code Four.
88	00:05:49	00:05:50	The blood trail went cold.
89	00:05:50	00:05:52	I need you to redirect to Catherine's house.
90	00:05:52	00:05:54	Greg's on the way.
91	00:05:54	00:05:55	Start on the perimeter, we'll meet you there.
92	00:05:55	00:05:57	Hey, Hodges.
93	00:05:57	00:06:02	Yeah? Do me a favor and wait here for auto detail, then follow that Denali back to the lab, okay?
94	00:06:02	00:06:04	I'm on it. Thanks.
95	00:06:04	00:06:09	Henry, I'm gonna need you to run that blood against Catherine and Russell, okay?
96	00:06:09	00:06:11	Hey, Henry, you with me?
97	00:06:11	00:06:13	Yeah. I just can't help but think...
98	00:06:13	00:06:15	Well, don't think, man, just do it.
99	00:06:15	00:06:18	Okay? Hey, did Catherine say anything to you about quitting?
100	00:06:18	00:06:25	No, why? She sent a resignation e-mail to Russell. Well, if she was gonna leave, she would've told us first.
101	00:06:25	00:06:27	Right?
102	00:06:27	00:06:29	Nothing's making sense right now.
103	00:06:29	00:06:33	Okay, I'm sticking with the plan-- radio silence.
104	00:06:33	00:06:35	If someone's listening in, they won't be hearing us.
105	00:06:35	00:06:37	Now all communication will be face-to-face.
106	00:06:37	00:06:40	The sheriff has agreed to wait an hour before she calls the Feds.
107	00:06:40	00:06:42	That buys us some time; that's good.
108	00:06:43	00:06:44	Stokes.
109	00:06:44	00:06:46	I'm at Russell's crime scene.
110	00:06:46	00:06:48	He was scheduled to meet me here an hour ago.
111	00:06:48	00:06:49	Well, I got a situation here, man.
112	00:06:49	00:06:51	I'll fill you in later.
113	00:06:51	00:06:55	I'll see if I can get us some help from the day shift. Okay, well, roll 'em when you can.
114	00:07:03	00:07:05	I thought you said this was the only D.B. here?
115	00:07:05	00:07:07	Only one I know of, Doc.
116	00:07:17	00:07:18	You must be the doctor.
117	00:07:18	00:07:19	What the hell's going on here?
118	00:07:19	00:07:21	Hey, Doc. Is that Catherine?
119	00:07:21	00:07:23	You're gonna have to patch her up here.
120	00:07:23	00:07:25	We can't take her to a hospital.
121	00:07:25	00:07:28	She's been shot. Luckily, we ran into an old friend of hers.
122	00:07:28	00:07:29	I'll fill you in later.
123	00:07:29	00:07:32	Kitty, thank you.
124	00:07:32	00:07:34	You gotta be the last doc in Vegas to make house calls.
125	00:07:34	00:07:37	You got a card? Honey, you don't want me coming to your house.
126	00:07:37	00:07:40	What do you think?
127	00:07:40	00:07:43	I think she'd be better off in a hospital.
128	00:07:43	00:07:47	You people waited an hour to call me?
129	00:07:47	00:07:48	I thought we were all on the same team here.
130	00:07:48	00:07:56	Seems to me, Agent Pratt, every time we call the FBI, Witnesses, your agents, my CSIs, all targeted, all on your watch.
131	00:07:56	00:07:58	And now CSI Willows and Russell have gone missing?
132	00:07:58	00:08:02	Okay, look, you forget that my partner, McQuaid, is dead, all right?
133	00:08:02	00:08:07	You don't think I care about the safety of CSI Russell and Willows as much as you do? You sure about that?
134	00:08:07	00:08:09	I'm sure of one thing-- I'm pulling rank.
135	00:08:09	00:08:12	From now on, everything goes through me. Oh, God...
136	00:08:12	00:08:13	Understood?
137	00:08:13	00:08:16	Mark Gabriel's on his way down here demanding to see his wife's body.
138	00:08:18	00:08:19	Don't worry, we got your back.
139	00:08:19	00:08:22	We'll scrape you off of the floor after he runs you over.
140	00:08:22	00:08:24	Hey, Greg.
141	00:08:24	00:08:26	Got a blood drop.
142	00:08:26	00:08:28	And I found blood on the driveway leading from the front door.
143	00:08:30	00:08:33	Blood trail leads into the street.
144	00:08:38	00:08:39	Blood pool.
145	00:08:40	00:08:43	Car drove through it.
146	00:08:43	00:08:46	Working theory...
147	00:08:46	00:08:47	it's Catherine's.
148	00:08:47	00:08:49	She's running from the shooters.
149	00:08:49	00:08:52	Wounded. She gets to the street, her blood's pooling...
150	00:08:52	00:08:54	Get in.
151	00:08:54	00:08:55	Flags down a motorist...
152	00:08:55	00:08:57	It's Russell.
153	00:08:57	00:08:58	The shooters are closing in...
154	00:09:01	00:09:04	Then she jumps in the backseat, and they take off.
155	00:09:04	00:09:09	But if that's the case, whose blood is this over here?
156	00:09:09	00:09:12	Trail leads down the embankment.
157	00:09:12	00:09:15	Let's see what we find on the other end.
158	00:09:28	00:09:29	I've seen these bugs before.
159	00:09:29	00:09:34	They're the same supercharged hide beetles that Gabriel's guys used on those bodies at the law firm.
160	00:09:34	00:09:37	Based on the timeline, it's only been here three or four hours.
161	00:09:37	00:09:39	The question is, who was he?
162	00:09:44	00:09:46	How bad is it?
163	00:09:46	00:09:49	It's through and through, but it didn't hit anything vital.
164	00:09:49	00:09:51	Well, that's good. Beats the alternative.
165	00:09:51	00:09:55	You've lost a lot of blood, and there's only so much I can do.
166	00:09:55	00:09:57	You're doing fine, Doc.
167	00:09:57	00:10:00	Well, we've got to stop this bleeding.
168	00:10:00	00:10:02	And the wound needs to be cauterized. Mm.
169	00:10:05	00:10:09	Well, actually, you've got very beautiful hair, Miss Kitty.
170	00:10:09	00:10:11	Thanks, but I'm not doing you-- you a cop.
171	00:10:11	00:10:15	No. I just thought maybe you might have a curling iron in your purse.
172	00:10:15	00:10:17	You some kind of Columbo or something?
173	00:10:22	00:10:23	What do you think?
174	00:10:23	00:10:25	Yeah. Well, it's only gonna hurt for a moment.
175	00:10:25	00:10:26	Once you go into shock...
176	00:10:26	00:10:28	Hell, y'all are serious.
177	00:10:28	00:10:30	I guess if you need a hand or something...
178	00:10:30	00:10:33	You're hired. Clean it with soap and water and warm it up.
179	00:10:34	00:10:36	You got a bullet I can bite on?
180	00:10:38	00:10:39	Got a bullet here.
181	00:10:41	00:10:43	Looks like a .40 cal.
182	00:10:43	00:10:48	That's the same caliber as the bullets that killed Laura Gabriel's cousin and her husband at the farmhouse.
183	00:10:48	00:10:50	Same shooter maybe.
184	00:10:50	00:10:52	I got a blood pool.
185	00:10:52	00:10:58	Morgan thinks that Catherine wasn't hit until she was outside.
186	00:10:58	00:11:00	Maybe Catherine got one of them.
187	00:11:00	00:11:03	Cleaning crew missed the rug pad.
188	00:11:03	00:11:05	Maybe we can get some DNA.
189	00:11:08	00:11:10	You got any cash?
190	00:11:10	00:11:11	Couple of hundred.
191	00:11:11	00:11:12	Yeah. That'll do.
192	00:11:12	00:11:14	Miss Kitty, thank you.
193	00:11:14	00:11:16	You've earned that.
194	00:11:16	00:11:17	You really, really hooked us up.
195	00:11:17	00:11:20	Here, I'd like to give these to you, too.
196	00:11:20	00:11:22	Oh.
197	00:11:22	00:11:24	Thank you.
198	00:11:24	00:11:25	You saved my life.
199	00:11:25	00:11:27	Okay.
200	00:11:27	00:11:29	This is a get-out-of-jail-free card.
201	00:11:29	00:11:31	Don't abuse it.
202	00:11:31	00:11:32	And please, don't talk to anyone.
203	00:11:32	00:11:35	These lips are sealed.
204	00:11:35	00:11:36	Didn't see nothing, don't know nothing.
205	00:11:36	00:11:40	And you can hang me by my feet and pull out my acrylic nails with pliers.
206	00:11:40	00:11:41	All right.
207	00:11:41	00:11:43	Let's go. Bye.
208	00:11:43	00:11:45	Bye.
209	00:11:45	00:11:48	D.B., Catherine's gonna need to sleep for a while.
210	00:11:48	00:11:50	I need you to get a message to Brass, okay?
211	00:11:50	00:11:53	Tell him to... tell him to bring us in.
212	00:12:00	00:12:01	Mitch?
213	00:12:01	00:12:02	CSI is finished.
214	00:12:02	00:12:04	They said we can release the scene.
215	00:12:04	00:12:05	The body's been transported?
216	00:12:05	00:12:07	Ten minutes ago.
217	00:12:07	00:12:08	Well, then, I am done, too.
218	00:12:08	00:12:10	Take care. Take care, Doc.
219	00:12:39	00:12:42	Mr. Gabriel, Undersheriff Ecklie. I believe you know...
220	00:12:42	00:12:44	Get him the hell out of here.
221	00:12:44	00:12:46	You killed my wife, you son of a bitch.
222	00:12:46	00:12:48	And don't think being FBI will save you.
223	00:12:48	00:12:50	I've got the director on my speed dial.
224	00:12:50	00:12:52	You're the one who killed your wife and my partner.
225	00:12:52	00:12:55	If you think you can play the victim-- If this man remains, then I'm leaving.
226	00:12:55	00:13:00	And then, you, Undersheriff and Captain Brass, will speak to my attorneys while I speak to the press.
227	00:13:00	00:13:03	Agent Pratt, it looks like this one goes through us.
228	00:13:03	00:13:05	I'm going to nail your ass.
229	00:13:05	00:13:08	Don't try and hide behind that frigging mirror, Boy Scout.
230	00:13:10	00:13:12	I came here to see my wife.
231	00:13:12	00:13:15	Understood, but first, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
232	00:13:15	00:13:17	I wasn't making a request.
233	00:13:17	00:13:19	Neither were we. (knocking)
234	00:13:19	00:13:20	Jim, I need to see you...
235	00:13:20	00:13:22	Doc, whatever it is, it's got to wait.
236	00:13:22	00:13:24	It can't.
237	00:13:46	00:13:47	We're too late.
238	00:13:47	00:13:49	What the hell happened?
239	00:13:54	00:13:56	We're still maintaining radio silence, right? Yeah.
240	00:13:56	00:13:59	So how'd the bad guys get here before we did? I don't know.
241	00:13:59	00:14:01	Maybe they showed up late for the party, too.
242	00:14:01	00:14:03	The screen's off.
243	00:14:03	00:14:06	Scuff marks.
244	00:14:09	00:14:10	Maybe Catherine and Russell made a quick exit.
245	00:14:10	00:14:13	I'm gonna go talk to the manager, see if he saw something.
246	00:14:13	00:14:15	I hope they made it out of here.
247	00:14:18	00:14:21	Yeah, that get-out-of-jail-free card-- that work for me, too?
248	00:14:21	00:14:23	Don't ask that when my friends are running for their lives.
249	00:14:23	00:14:24	Oh, well, let me rephrase then.
250	00:14:24	00:14:27	When y'all stop running, can a brother get one?
251	00:14:27	00:14:31	If we get out of this alive, I'll get you one with revolving credit.
252	00:14:31	00:14:33	Yeah, I like the sound of that.
253	00:14:33	00:14:34	Hey, if there's any revolving credit, it's mine.
254	00:14:34	00:14:37	I'm the one who spotted that guy in that raincoat.
255	00:14:37	00:14:39	Knew his ass was up to no good.
256	00:14:39	00:14:40	Yeah, thank you for that call.
257	00:14:40	00:14:42	What tipped you off?
258	00:14:42	00:14:47	Honey, in that neighborhood, the only suit a man wears under his trench coat is his birthday suit.
259	00:14:47	00:14:50	Spoken like a trained observer.
260	00:14:50	00:14:55	In a couple of blocks, there's gonna be an alley on your right.
261	00:14:56	00:14:57	Hey, Doc.
262	00:14:57	00:14:59	Hey. How's Catherine?
263	00:14:59	00:15:00	She should be on some heavy-duty antibiotics.
264	00:15:00	00:15:02	You don't know, do you?
265	00:15:02	00:15:05	What? She and Russell are still out there, man.
266	00:15:05	00:15:07	When Brass got to the motel, they were gone.
267	00:15:07	00:15:09	He said it looked like they went out a bathroom window.
268	00:15:09	00:15:11	Catherine's in no condition to be on the run. I know that.
269	00:15:11	00:15:13	Certainly not with a hit team chasing her.
270	00:15:13	00:15:15	Well, let's hope that we get to them before they do.
271	00:15:15	00:15:18	What can this stiff tell us about the guys who might be after them?
272	00:15:18	00:15:21	Uh, he appears to be a middle-aged, white male.
273	00:15:21	00:15:24	Hide beetles consumed all of his skin and most of his tissue.
274	00:15:24	00:15:27	He was shot four times. Check this out.
275	00:15:27	00:15:32	Three of the shots entered the mid-back, the fourth shot penetrated the frontal lobe.
276	00:15:32	00:15:34	These look like 5.7's.
277	00:15:34	00:15:36	I was thinking Catherine was the one who hit this guy.
278	00:15:36	00:15:37	You were thinking wrong.
279	00:15:37	00:15:42	Five-sevens suggest friendly fire from one of the other hit men.
280	00:15:48	00:15:49	Yeah, the coup de grâce to finish him off.
281	00:15:53	00:15:56	Cloak and dagger is a little bit outside my area of expertise.
282	00:15:56	00:16:01	But if these black ops guys were so good at cleaning up crime scenes, why didn't they just take him with them?
283	00:16:01	00:16:03	A wounded man would only slow them down, I guess.
284	00:16:03	00:16:09	But still, for pros, they sure have been making a lot of mistakes.
285	00:16:09	00:16:10	Here, put this on.
286	00:16:10	00:16:12	You're gonna need to cover all that up.
287	00:16:12	00:16:13	Thank you.
288	00:16:13	00:16:18	Hey, Jackory, hate to ask you for another favor, but I need a cell phone.
289	00:16:18	00:16:19	Can I borrow one?
290	00:16:19	00:16:21	Swear to God, I'll get it back to you.
291	00:16:25	00:16:26	Oh.
292	00:16:26	00:16:28	Take your pick.
293	00:16:28	00:16:31	Disposable, can't be traced. (laughs)
294	00:16:31	00:16:33	Thank you.
295	00:16:33	00:16:36	And I got a feeling you're going to be needing this, too.
296	00:16:36	00:16:40	Yeah, that's more, uh, Annie Oakley here.
297	00:16:46	00:16:48	You may not be getting that back.
298	00:16:48	00:16:50	Darling, the way you're handling that piece, I think I will.
299	00:16:52	00:16:55	Thank you, guys.
300	00:16:55	00:16:56	Thank you.
301	00:16:56	00:16:58	You two take care.
302	00:17:00	00:17:03	This is your idea of a safe place to hide out?
303	00:17:03	00:17:06	When we're in Seattle, we can go to your coffeehouse.
304	00:17:06	00:17:07	Yeah?
305	00:17:07	00:17:09	Yeah, I need to see Teddy Jr.
306	00:17:09	00:17:10	You got a name?
307	00:17:10	00:17:14	Just, uh, tell him it's... Goldilocks.
308	00:17:34	00:17:36	Hey, Teddy. Goldilocks!
309	00:17:36	00:17:38	Oh, God, it's been too long.
310	00:17:38	00:17:41	It sure has. Mm.
311	00:17:41	00:17:42	Wish the old man was still with us.
312	00:17:42	00:17:44	He always loved when you stopped by.
313	00:17:44	00:17:50	Even after you became a cop. Teddy, listen, um... I'm in kind of a jam.
314	00:17:50	00:17:52	You need a doctor? No, I'm fine.
315	00:17:52	00:17:58	It actually looks worse than it is, but my friend Russell and I need to disappear for a while.
316	00:17:59	00:18:01	No problem.
317	00:18:01	00:18:04	The old man would have rolled out the red carpet for you.
318	00:18:04	00:18:06	Sit down.
319	00:18:06	00:18:07	Thanks, Teddy.
320	00:18:07	00:18:08	I'll get you some sandwiches.
321	00:18:14	00:18:16	So... Goldilocks?
322	00:18:18	00:18:29	Uh, well, there was a time when the only thing I cared more about than having fun was getting attention, and a girl gets a lot of attention on a pole.
323	00:18:29	00:18:35	But the thing is-- thank you-- working a pole is about working guys.
324	00:18:35	00:18:38	Lonely guys with money who just want to forget their problems.
325	00:18:38	00:18:46	Well, one night, right here at this bar, I met a guy who had a problem, but he wasn't trying to forget it.
326	00:18:46	00:18:47	He was trying to solve it.
327	00:18:47	00:18:49	Who was the guy?
328	00:18:49	00:18:52	Jimmy Tadero. Detective.
329	00:18:52	00:18:56	Well, he was working a case, and we started talking.
330	00:18:56	00:19:01	For once, someone saw me as more than just a pretty face.
331	00:19:01	00:19:03	And a few other attributes.
332	00:19:03	00:19:05	Jimmy sounds like a very wise man.
333	00:19:05	00:19:13	After that night, between dances, we would, uh, sit here at this bar, and...
334	00:19:13	00:19:17	he'd run cases, and he'd ask my opinion.
335	00:19:17	00:19:20	So, this is where you became a CSI.
336	00:19:20	00:19:22	Yeah.
337	00:19:22	00:19:23	Well, how about...
338	00:19:23	00:19:27	how about you run this case with me right now?
339	00:19:27	00:19:30	Don't you think you should make a phone call first, to your wife?
340	00:19:30	00:19:34	Oh. When was the last time you went 24 hours without talking to her?
341	00:19:36	00:19:37	Hey, doll. No, I'm sorry.
342	00:19:37	00:19:39	I, um... I'm okay.
343	00:19:39	00:19:41	I just lost my phone out in the field.
344	00:19:41	00:19:44	I'm at a strip club with Catherine.
345	00:19:46	00:19:49	Why do you always assume that I'm out on a job or something?
346	00:19:49	00:19:53	You know, I could have come here just for myself, you know.
347	00:19:53	00:19:56	We still don't know where they are?
348	00:19:56	00:19:58	I would assume they're out there on the move.
349	00:19:58	00:20:00	It's a lot safer than coming in here. Can't blame them.
350	00:20:00	00:20:01	What do we have?
351	00:20:01	00:20:03	First blush-- a hit team gone wild.
352	00:20:03	00:20:04	But more miss than hit lately.
353	00:20:04	00:20:06	I don't get it.
354	00:20:06	00:20:08	These guys are supposed to be the best in the world.
355	00:20:08	00:20:10	At least that's what you keep telling us, right?
356	00:20:10	00:20:12	That's their rep.
357	00:20:12	00:20:16	And we saw that at Malcolm Turner's law office-- covert, efficient, clean, A-plus.
358	00:20:16	00:20:19	Yeah, but it wasn't perfect. We found the bodies.
359	00:20:19	00:20:21	With 5.7-caliber bullets in them.
360	00:20:21	00:20:24	Yeah, and picked clean by those bioengineered bugs.
361	00:20:24	00:20:27	All of which strongly suggests Mark Gabriel's hand in the killings.
362	00:20:27	00:20:28	Exactly.
363	00:20:28	00:20:30	Which is just the start of the screwups.
364	00:20:30	00:20:33	Since then, these A students have been turning in B work.
365	00:20:33	00:20:38	Two days ago, Laura Gabriel's cousin's house, husband and wife murdered, and there was no attempt to clean up.
366	00:20:38	00:20:42	And the world's greatest hit team couldn't even find Laura Gabriel hiding under the floorboards.
367	00:20:42	00:20:44	Yeah.
368	00:20:44	00:20:45	And made a total mess of it.
369	00:20:45	00:20:48	That FBI convoy hit was on a public street in broad daylight.
370	00:20:48	00:20:51	Not to mention, two hours later, Catherine's targeted.
371	00:20:51	00:20:54	Even with the element of surprise, they missed.
372	00:20:54	00:20:56	And hit one of their own. Friendly fire.
373	00:20:56	00:21:00	They finished him off, left him in a culvert with Mark Gabriel's superbugs on him.
374	00:21:00	00:21:02	Might as well have left a calling card.
375	00:21:02	00:21:05	These guys sanitize some scenes and muck up others.
376	00:21:05	00:21:07	Why the inconsistencies?
377	00:21:07	00:21:08	I know Mark Gabriel.
378	00:21:08	00:21:09	He doesn't make these kinds of mistakes.
379	00:21:09	00:21:11	Maybe they aren't mistakes.
380	00:21:11	00:21:12	Maybe it's all intentional.
381	00:21:12	00:21:16	You think that Mark Gabriel's guys are leaving evidence behind on purpose?
382	00:21:16	00:21:17	Not just any evidence.
383	00:21:17	00:21:19	Evidence that points to Mark Gabriel.
384	00:21:19	00:21:23	If what you're suggesting is true...
385	00:21:23	00:21:25	then Mark Gabriel's not the one calling the shots.
386	00:21:25	00:21:27	He's... he's being set up.
387	00:21:27	00:21:29	By who?
388	00:21:29	00:21:31	And why?
389	00:21:33	00:21:34	Thank you very much.
390	00:21:34	00:21:36	How you doing?
391	00:21:36	00:21:37	You all right?
392	00:21:37	00:21:42	Well, considering I've been shot in my side and cauterized by a hooker's curling iron, yeah, I guess so.
393	00:21:42	00:21:45	So, you said you wanted to talk about the case? Yeah.
394	00:21:45	00:21:49	I want to talk about how Mark Gabriel is not our guy.
395	00:21:49	00:21:50	Excuse me?
396	00:21:50	00:21:53	The resignation letter-- you didn't send it, did you?
397	00:21:53	00:21:55	What resignation letter?
398	00:21:55	00:21:57	This one.
399	00:21:57	00:22:02	I, uh, printed it out before I drove over to see you.
400	00:22:02	00:22:06	Uh, effective immediately, I tender my resignation.
401	00:22:06	00:22:09	It's a decision I've been considering for a while...
402	00:22:09	00:22:11	it's best for the team...
403	00:22:11	00:22:12	I didn't write that.
404	00:22:12	00:22:14	But wait, it gets better; here you go.
405	00:22:14	00:22:20	I've made the decision to go away for a while, but first, I have to do something.
406	00:22:20	00:22:24	I have one last bit of unfinished business to clear my desk.
407	00:22:24	00:22:26	I hope you'll understand.
408	00:22:26	00:22:27	What the hell?
409	00:22:27	00:22:31	Listen, I think you need to read this whole email resignation you sent.
410	00:22:31	00:22:33	I think you'll find it's not that far off the mark.
411	00:22:33	00:22:36	For 19 years, I've dedicated myself to this lab.
412	00:22:36	00:22:38	My authority has been questioned.
413	00:22:38	00:22:40	My professional objectivity doubted.
414	00:22:40	00:22:51	Though I graciously accepted an unwanted demotion, I now find my lesser role unsatisfying and untenable.
415	00:22:51	00:22:53	Little close to the bone, I imagine.
416	00:22:54	00:22:56	How did they know?
417	00:22:56	00:23:01	Well, if they were able to hack into your account to send that email, I imagine they've been reading them all.
418	00:23:01	00:23:02	All to manufacture a resignation letter?
419	00:23:02	00:23:04	I-I don't think so.
420	00:23:04	00:23:06	I think it's more of a... like, a cover story, right?
421	00:23:06	00:23:09	CSI seeks revenge for the murder of her friend.
422	00:23:09	00:23:12	Goes nuts, goes home, resigns.
423	00:23:12	00:23:15	But not before she commits one last crazy act.
424	00:23:15	00:23:17	And who does she direct her rage against?
425	00:23:17	00:23:19	Mark Gabriel.
426	00:23:19	00:23:22	Then that's gotta be why they took my backup gun.
427	00:23:22	00:23:25	They were planning to use it on-on Gabriel.
428	00:23:25	00:23:26	To make you the patsy.
429	00:23:26	00:23:30	I go postal, I kill Gabriel and then... get disappeared.
430	00:23:30	00:23:33	Yeah, but you screwed up their plans-- you survived.
431	00:23:33	00:23:37	All I know is that with you still alive, they've got no play.
432	00:23:37	00:23:42	So, safest thing for you to do right now is to come in out of the cold.
433	00:23:42	00:23:48	Well, safe for me, maybe, but then they'll go underground and we'll never catch them.
434	00:23:48	00:23:49	Hey, Teddy.
435	00:23:49	00:23:51	Maybe we can have it both ways.
436	00:23:51	00:23:52	I need one more favor. No problem.
437	00:23:52	00:23:56	Can you call the coroner and tell him that you got two stiffs here that need picking up.
438	00:23:56	00:23:59	And make sure to bring two body bags.
439	00:23:59	00:24:00	One extra long.
440	00:24:00	00:24:04	You got it.
441	00:24:14	00:24:15	Welcome back to the living.
442	00:24:15	00:24:18	Heard you been hitting the strip clubs.
443	00:24:18	00:24:21	Yeah, why is that so hard for everyone to believe?
444	00:24:21	00:24:23	Coming through.
445	00:24:29	00:24:30	Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
446	00:24:30	00:24:32	For a second we thought you were...
447	00:24:32	00:24:37	That you ran off to a Caribbean island and left us with your caseload.
448	00:24:37	00:24:39	No, I'm not running anymore.
449	00:24:39	00:24:40	That's 'cause we're on the hunt now.
450	00:24:40	00:24:42	I'm going to need to redress that wound.
451	00:24:42	00:24:44	And I'm going to need to redress.
452	00:24:50	00:24:54	So that, uh, resignation letter was a fake.
453	00:24:54	00:24:56	Yeah, a good one.
454	00:24:56	00:24:57	They hacked your computer.
455	00:24:57	00:24:59	They've been reading your email.
456	00:24:59	00:25:01	Getting inside my head.
457	00:25:01	00:25:04	So, you really feel that way?
458	00:25:04	00:25:07	Something's missing in your life?
459	00:25:09	00:25:13	Since Lindsey's left home, yeah.
460	00:25:13	00:25:15	I mean, I'm not sure what I'm missing.
461	00:25:15	00:25:21	Some days, I... I think it's a man to share my life with, and... then, other days, I'm good.
462	00:25:21	00:25:23	I'm good to be alone.
463	00:25:23	00:25:26	I mean, look at my friend Laura.
464	00:25:26	00:25:28	(groans) She had everything.
465	00:25:28	00:25:32	Appeared to have a perfect life.
466	00:25:32	00:25:36	And it all turned out to be a lie.
467	00:25:38	00:25:40	And then she turned out dead.
468	00:25:40	00:25:44	I thought for sure Mark Gabriel killed her, tried to kill me.
469	00:25:44	00:25:46	Now we know it was all a setup.
470	00:25:46	00:25:47	Yeah, who's pulling the strings?
471	00:25:47	00:25:50	It's gotta be someone in his operation, right?
472	00:25:50	00:25:52	I'm going with Occam's razor.
473	00:25:52	00:25:59	Sometimes the simplest answer is the right answer, and the one that's right in front of you.
474	00:26:01	00:26:04	Until a couple weeks ago, you didn't even know who Mark Gabriel was.
475	00:26:04	00:26:09	And you hadn't seen your good friend Laura since you were kids.
476	00:26:09	00:26:11	What are you saying?
477	00:26:11	00:26:14	I'm saying, maybe you didn't just run into your friend.
478	00:26:16	00:26:18	I think that Sara might be right.
479	00:26:18	00:26:24	I see Laura after all these years in reception at PD, waiting for her husband.
480	00:26:24	00:26:33	She allows me to see her in a controlling, abusive relationship; she then comes to me, says she's got information on her husband that can put him away.
481	00:26:33	00:26:36	She's afraid, I send her to a lawyer.
482	00:26:36	00:26:38	Who ends up dead. Yes.
483	00:26:38	00:26:43	All signs pointing to her husband, Mark Gabriel, as the guy who hired the killers.
484	00:26:43	00:26:47	Yes, but if it's not Gabriel, and he's being set up to look guilty...
485	00:26:47	00:26:48	And to die by your hand.
486	00:26:48	00:26:50	Who stands to benefit?
487	00:26:50	00:26:51	The wife...
488	00:26:51	00:26:54	who is dead and burned beyond recognition.
489	00:26:54	00:26:58	You know, like everything else in this damn case, all is not what it seems.
490	00:26:58	00:27:00	Hey, Henry.
491	00:27:00	00:27:01	Henry, where...
492	00:27:01	00:27:02	(thumps) Ow.
493	00:27:02	00:27:04	Aw, I'm sorry, did we wake you up?
494	00:27:04	00:27:06	It's been a rough 48.
495	00:27:06	00:27:12	You think? Hey, what did you use as an exemplar to identify the burned bodies in the FBI sedan?
496	00:27:12	00:27:13	Well, the agents were easy.
497	00:27:13	00:27:15	I just ran their DNA against the FBI database.
498	00:27:15	00:27:20	What about Laura Gabriel? I had exemplars from the Gabriels' condo here in Vegas.
499	00:27:20	00:27:22	What do you think?
500	00:27:22	00:27:26	Plenty of opportunity to plant someone else's comb or toothbrush in that condo.
501	00:27:29	00:27:31	We have another exemplar.
502	00:27:31	00:27:35	Laura's clothes were bagged at the hospital after we found her at her cousin's house.
503	00:27:35	00:27:40	Okay, so run those clothes, and then compare the new exemplar to our female DB.
504	00:27:40	00:27:45	And I want to run all the DNA in this case against every known database.
505	00:27:45	00:27:46	Got it.
506	00:28:38	00:28:45	We compared a secondary exemplar for Laura Gabriel against the female who died in your protective custody.
507	00:28:45	00:28:47	No match.
508	00:28:47	00:28:48	Body wasn't Laura Gabriel.
509	00:28:48	00:28:49	What are you talking about?
510	00:28:49	00:28:57	We ran the DNA from all the bodies in that car against every known database under the sun, including U.S. military.
511	00:28:57	00:28:58	We were able to identify the female body.
512	00:28:58	00:29:01	She was one of the assassins who hit the law firm.
513	00:29:01	00:29:05	She infiltrated your protection detail yesterday.
514	00:29:05	00:29:07	Well, how did she end up dead in the back of the FBI sedan?
515	00:29:07	00:29:11	My guess, shot by someone she trusted when she wasn't looking.
516	00:29:11	00:29:15	And then somebody took a torch to her, because they wanted us to believe she was Laura Gabriel.
517	00:29:15	00:29:22	For the same reason they wanted us to believe the guy sitting next to her was your partner, Agent McQuaid.
518	00:29:22	00:29:25	No, no, McQuaid died in that car.
519	00:29:25	00:29:27	He was identified by the FBI database.
520	00:29:27	00:29:32	Which McQuaid updated with a new exemplar one month ago.
521	00:29:32	00:29:38	Same military database identified the McQuaid body as a Geoffrey Krueger.
522	00:29:38	00:29:43	Like our female assassin-- ex-Army, and now former Ceressus employee.
523	00:29:43	00:29:45	Wait a second-- no, no, no, I don't believe any of this.
524	00:29:45	00:29:48	You're telling me that, uh, McQuaid is...
525	00:29:48	00:29:50	Dirty.
526	00:29:50	00:29:54	And that he and Laura are the ones behind this whole thing.
527	00:29:54	00:29:56	Three other agents died in that ambush.
528	00:29:56	00:30:01	Not to mention, the couple from the farmhouse, those people from the law firm-- why would he do that?
529	00:30:01	00:30:03	Sex, money...
530	00:30:03	00:30:05	...maybe both. We know your team was compromised.
531	00:30:05	00:30:09	And to be honest, until now, I thought it was you.
532	00:30:09	00:30:13	I'm sorry, is that supposed to make me feel better?
533	00:30:19	00:30:21	Hey, come on.
534	00:30:21	00:30:22	None of us saw this coming.
535	00:30:22	00:30:25	Yeah, but I worked with the guy, ten hours a days, for the past year.
536	00:30:25	00:30:28	I mean, it's not like we were best friends, but...
537	00:30:30	00:30:34	You know, I should've known when McQuaid said he was quitting, that something was up.
538	00:30:34	00:30:36	And he...
539	00:30:36	00:30:38	he always had this weakness when it came to beautiful women.
540	00:30:38	00:30:40	Well, they're still out there.
541	00:30:40	00:30:44	And like you said, they left a trail of bodies behind them.
542	00:30:44	00:30:45	So what do we do?
543	00:30:45	00:30:51	When she was playing the victim, Laura Gabriel gave us her husband's banking connection to his hit team.
544	00:30:51	00:30:53	She was gonna use it to set him up.
545	00:30:53	00:30:54	Why don't we use it to set her up?
546	00:30:54	00:30:56	That sounds good.
547	00:30:56	00:30:58	Good, 'cause the next part won't.
548	00:31:09	00:31:11	So now you want my help?
549	00:31:11	00:31:14	That's right.
550	00:31:14	00:31:16	Interesting choice of venue.
551	00:31:16	00:31:19	You've been watching too many movies.
552	00:31:19	00:31:21	I wanted to make sure your people weren't listening.
553	00:31:21	00:31:24	Does that go for LVPD, too?
554	00:31:26	00:31:28	We're the least of your problems.
555	00:31:28	00:31:34	I understand I'm no longer a person of interest, but I'd be interested in knowing who is now.
556	00:31:34	00:31:36	So?
557	00:31:36	00:31:37	Your wife.
558	00:31:37	00:31:40	With help from my former partner.
559	00:31:40	00:31:43	Laura and Agent McQuaid are dead.
560	00:31:43	00:31:45	She played you.
561	00:31:47	00:31:50	Impressive.
562	00:31:50	00:31:53	Clearly my wife learned a few things over the years.
563	00:31:53	00:31:56	She set your own dogs on you, and you know who they are.
564	00:31:56	00:31:57	And how to bring them to heel.
565	00:31:58	00:32:00	She betrayed us both.
566	00:32:01	00:32:03	But you want this bad.
567	00:32:03	00:32:05	I assume that's why you're keeping company with the Boy Scout.
568	00:32:05	00:32:07	Like the man said, we need your help.
569	00:32:07	00:32:08	Look...
570	00:32:08	00:32:11	someone on your payroll knows where Laura and McQuaid are.
571	00:32:15	00:32:17	This has been a helpful conversation.
572	00:32:17	00:32:21	But I prefer to settle my own affairs.
573	00:32:21	00:32:23	Good evening.
574	00:32:27	00:32:28	That went well.
575	00:32:30	00:32:32	I hope so.
576	00:32:32	00:32:36	Just hope he's not as smart as he thinks he is.
577	00:34:14	00:34:17	I won't miss next time.
578	00:34:17	00:34:21	Put the gun on the floor, and keep the hands where we can see them.
579	00:34:24	00:34:26	How did you find me?
580	00:34:26	00:34:27	We just followed the money.
581	00:34:27	00:34:29	Mark Gabriel made you a better offer.
582	00:34:29	00:34:32	Double the money to take the contract off his head and put it on his wife's.
583	00:34:32	00:34:34	And Laura Gabriel...
584	00:34:34	00:34:35	was very cooperative.
585	00:34:35	00:34:40	When things become personal, business always suffers.
586	00:34:40	00:34:42	Well, our business isn't concluded.
587	00:34:42	00:34:43	Where's McQuaid?
588	00:34:43	00:34:44	You don't know?
589	00:34:46	00:34:47	You already have him.
590	00:34:53	00:34:55	Talked to McQuaid's ex-wife.
591	00:34:55	00:34:58	She still had some of his things in the garage, including a shaving kit.
592	00:34:58	00:35:02	Ran the DNA, and Obrecht was right-- we do have McQuaid.
593	00:35:02	00:35:05	Where? In the morgue.
594	00:35:05	00:35:07	Wha...? No, no.
595	00:35:07	00:35:12	We... we identified the burned body in the FBI sedan, and it wasn't him.
596	00:35:12	00:35:13	That's not the body I'm talking about.
597	00:35:13	00:35:17	I'm talking about the body that your guys found in the culvert by her house.
598	00:35:17	00:35:23	He was there, at my house? The bullet that missed you was a .40-caliber-- that's the only kind of gun McQuaid ever carried.
599	00:35:23	00:35:29	Great. Not only did he set me up, Now, wait a second.
600	00:35:29	00:35:32	The autopsy said he was hit in the back with 5.7's, right?
601	00:35:32	00:35:35	So he was running towards you.
602	00:35:35	00:35:39	You know, maybe he didn't miss; maybe he was firing a warning shot.
603	00:35:39	00:35:41	He was trying to protect you.
604	00:35:41	00:35:44	Yeah, McQuaid got a lot of people killed, but maybe that night, he was trying to save someone.
605	00:35:44	00:35:47	Why?
606	00:35:47	00:35:49	Well, obviously, he cared for you.
607	00:35:55	00:35:58	Hey, wait up.
608	00:35:58	00:36:01	I never got a chance to say this, but you really kicked ass last night.
609	00:36:02	00:36:04	Thanks.
610	00:36:04	00:36:06	Listen, Russell's right.
611	00:36:06	00:36:07	McQuaid had feelings for you.
612	00:36:07	00:36:09	But I think there was something else, too.
613	00:36:09	00:36:13	I think that he saw in you what he used to be.
614	00:36:13	00:36:15	What was that?
615	00:36:15	00:36:17	Someone with integrity.
616	00:36:17	00:36:19	Someone who wouldn't give up.
617	00:36:19	00:36:21	The kind of agent that the Bureau needs.
618	00:36:25	00:36:28	Are you asking me out on a date, or offering me a job?
619	00:36:28	00:36:31	No, it was a job offer, but I...
620	00:36:31	00:36:34	but it's one that I really think that you should consider.
621	00:36:36	00:36:38	Well, I'm still on this job right now.
622	00:36:39	00:36:41	But thanks.
623	00:36:52	00:36:55	I already gave my statement to the other detectives.
624	00:36:55	00:36:57	I just have one question.
625	00:36:58	00:37:00	Why me?
626	00:37:00	00:37:02	You really have to ask?
627	00:37:02	00:37:03	Why do you think I chose you?
628	00:37:04	00:37:06	I know you.
629	00:37:06	00:37:08	Really.
630	00:37:08	00:37:09	How do you figure that?
631	00:37:15	00:37:22	When we were kids, you always went for the boy who needed you; I always went for the boy who would give me something.
632	00:37:22	00:37:25	Are you talking about your husband?
633	00:37:25	00:37:26	Or McQuaid?
634	00:37:26	00:37:28	Both.
635	00:37:28	00:37:31	Mark gave me a lifestyle.
636	00:37:31	00:37:33	Worked for a while.
637	00:37:33	00:37:34	Then it didn't.
638	00:37:36	00:37:38	Then I met McQuaid.
639	00:37:38	00:37:41	Investigating the gunrunning case here in Vegas.
640	00:37:41	00:37:44	And you saw an opportunity... to set your husband up.
641	00:37:46	00:37:47	To set me up.
642	00:37:47	00:37:51	I take what I want.
643	00:37:51	00:37:55	You put everyone else first, because that's the easier way.
644	00:37:55	00:37:58	You'd rather accept the life you have...
645	00:37:58	00:38:00	than risk having the life you want.
646	00:38:03	00:38:05	You're never gonna see the outside world again, Laura.
647	00:38:07	00:38:10	Tell me whose life you'd rather have now.
648	00:38:12	00:38:13	Oh, and...
649	00:38:13	00:38:20	you do know me-- but not as well as you think, because when you chose me, you should've known it was gonna end like this.
650	00:38:30	00:38:33	Well, we picked up Mark Gabriel on conspiracy to murder his wife.
651	00:38:33	00:38:36	Oh, raincoat guy sold him out.
652	00:38:36	00:38:38	Wanted to dodge the needle. Wow.
653	00:38:38	00:38:40	Guy had no problem dealing death.
654	00:38:40	00:38:42	It's a different story when it's his own life on the line, huh?
655	00:39:01	00:39:03	Did you call a family meeting?
656	00:39:03	00:39:06	No. No, I... No, I didn't.
657	00:39:06	00:39:07	Catherine did.
658	00:39:07	00:39:08	So...
659	00:39:08	00:39:10	what's going on?
660	00:39:11	00:39:15	I just wanted to say how...
661	00:39:15	00:39:18	brilliant I think you all are...
662	00:39:19	00:39:29	...what a great team this is, how much I respect all of you, both as coworkers...
663	00:39:29	00:39:30	and as friends.
664	00:39:32	00:39:38	Well, as you all know, there were a few changes made, a couple of months ago, which, uh...
665	00:39:38	00:39:42	(sighs) initially hurt me...
666	00:39:42	00:39:45	but, um, ultimately...
667	00:39:45	00:39:47	ended up being a great thing.
668	00:39:49	00:39:51	And, Nicky...
669	00:39:51	00:39:56	I was so wrong when I said that...
670	00:39:56	00:40:01	it's been a long 19 years here in this lab...
671	00:40:01	00:40:03	in this town.
672	00:40:03	00:40:05	I mean, the truth is...
673	00:40:07	00:40:09	...it's just gone by too fast.
674	00:40:09	00:40:12	But...
675	00:40:12	00:40:16	there comes a point in one's life in which...
676	00:40:16	00:40:19	one feels compelled to make a change.
677	00:40:20	00:40:22	What are you saying?
678	00:40:22	00:40:27	That I've been offered another job.
679	00:40:27	00:40:28	With the FBI.
680	00:40:30	00:40:31	I've decided to take it.
681	00:40:31	00:40:33	When?
682	00:40:33	00:40:35	Well, it's effective immediately.
683	00:40:35	00:40:37	I...
684	00:40:37	00:40:41	tendered my resignation.
685	00:40:41	00:40:44	For real this time.
686	00:40:45	00:40:49	You are all family...
687	00:40:49	00:40:53	which is why...
688	00:40:53	00:40:56	this is the hardest decision I've ever made.
689	00:40:56	00:41:00	I mean, how could I leave this place?
690	00:41:00	00:41:04	How could I leave all of you?
691	00:41:04	00:41:09	But not only are you in great hands...
692	00:41:09	00:41:11	but you...
693	00:41:11	00:41:17	are a rock-solid, bad-ass team of criminalists, and don't ever forget it.
694	00:41:17	00:41:22	We all just love you, Catherine.
695	00:41:22	00:41:28	And, you know, even though you're leaving, you'll always be here with us, always.
696	00:41:28	00:41:30	Yeah.
697	00:41:30	00:41:32	We love you.
698	00:41:32	00:41:35	I love you, too.
699	00:41:39	00:41:40	Go get 'em.
700	00:41:50	00:41:54	I sat here...
701	00:41:54	00:42:00	a very long time ago and talked about how solving a case can...
702	00:42:00	00:42:03	make you feel like King Kong on cocaine.
703	00:42:03	00:42:07	But just like any drug...
704	00:42:07	00:42:10	it's got a dark side...
705	00:42:10	00:42:13	and the rush is fleeting.
706	00:42:13	00:42:16	Just like life.
707	00:42:17	00:42:19	This is the only thing I'm good at.
708	00:42:19	00:42:21	Then hang on to that.
709	00:42:21	00:42:24	But not so tight that...
710	00:42:24	00:42:26	you let the rest slip away.
711	00:42:28	00:42:31	I know your dad would tell you the same thing.
712	00:42:38	00:42:40	Back to work.
713	00:42:40	00:42:42	Go ahead. I got this one.
714	00:42:43	00:42:45	I got the next one.
715	00:42:45	00:42:47	You got it.
