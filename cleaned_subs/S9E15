0	00:01:55	00:01:56	See this car over here?
1	00:01:56	00:01:58	This is m-my car.
2	00:01:58	00:02:01	And I-I thought... that was...
3	00:03:15	00:03:19	Wealthy art dealer comes out for a late-night swim.
4	00:03:19	00:03:22	Somebody's there who shouldn't be.
5	00:03:25	00:03:27	That is a whole lot of face smashing.
6	00:03:27	00:03:30	You think it was a crime of passion?
7	00:03:30	00:03:32	That is what it takes to make great art.
8	00:03:40	00:03:43	Can you think of anybody who wanted to hurt your fiancÃ©?
9	00:03:43	00:03:46	Carsten was an art dealer.
10	00:03:46	00:03:52	He dedicated his life to bringing beauty into the world, inspiring people.
11	00:03:52	00:03:54	Everybody loved him.
12	00:03:54	00:03:59	$5 million property, 50-cent lock.
13	00:03:59	00:04:02	Easy access for anyone who wanted to get in.
14	00:04:02	00:04:05	Thank you for helping out today, Wendy.
15	00:04:05	00:04:06	Oh, I'm happy to.
16	00:04:06	00:04:07	We had a lot of bodies today.
17	00:04:07	00:04:11	Yeah. I mean, I'm not happy that we had a lot of bodies today.
18	00:04:15	00:04:16	There's a blood trail here.
19	00:04:18	00:04:21	I have absolutely no idea how I could have missed that.
20	00:04:23	00:04:26	Right here...
21	00:04:26	00:04:28	and here.
22	00:04:28	00:04:30	And here.
23	00:04:34	00:04:36	Aha! It was him!
24	00:04:36	00:04:39	I didn't think I missed it.
25	00:04:39	00:04:41	Hi.
26	00:04:41	00:04:44	Hi... Gareth.
27	00:04:44	00:04:48	He must have snuck in while I was processing the pool.
28	00:04:48	00:04:51	Well, it's actually his house.
29	00:04:51	00:04:53	When was the last time you saw Carsten?
30	00:04:53	00:04:57	Um... after everybody left, he went outside to have a relaxing swim to calm down.
31	00:04:57	00:04:59	Why did he need to calm down?
32	00:04:59	00:05:01	I'm not really sure.
33	00:05:01	00:05:07	Uh, but during the party, I saw him go into his office with a client I hadn't seen before.
34	00:05:07	00:05:09	The next thing I know...
35	00:05:09	00:05:12	I want everybody out of here! Out, out, out!
36	00:05:12	00:05:14	Party's over!
37	00:05:14	00:05:16	Carsten was so upset.
38	00:05:16	00:05:21	But he wouldn't tell me what happened, so I went to bed alone.
39	00:05:21	00:05:28	The next thing, it was morning and the pool guy was shouting to call the police.
40	00:05:28	00:05:30	The office should be right up ahead.
41	00:05:30	00:05:33	Is Brass getting the surveillance?
42	00:05:33	00:05:39	Yes, but there doesn't appear to be any camera with a clear view of the pool.
43	00:05:39	00:05:41	Well, I doubt Hef has them in the grotto either.
44	00:05:46	00:05:48	Obvious signs of a struggle.
45	00:05:48	00:05:51	I'll swab the usual places for touch DNA.
46	00:06:10	00:06:16	These are Mesopotamian vases circa 700 B.C.E.
47	00:06:16	00:06:18	These should be in a museum.
48	00:06:18	00:06:20	Yes, they're trophies.
49	00:06:20	00:06:24	Collecting's pathological whether you're a rich man or a serial killer.
50	00:06:26	00:06:28	Oh, hey, no, Gareth!
51	00:06:28	00:06:30	No, no, no, no!
52	00:06:30	00:06:31	Don't lick the evidence.
53	00:06:31	00:06:34	Shh-shh! Go! Go! Go!
54	00:06:34	00:06:36	And I thought dogs would eat anything.
55	00:06:36	00:06:41	This is the video surveillance from Carsten Pennington's party.
56	00:06:41	00:06:46	This all seems consistent with what Carsten's fiancÃ©e told Brass.
57	00:06:46	00:06:48	Do we have any idea what prompted his outburst?
58	00:06:48	00:06:52	I don't know what, but...
59	00:06:53	00:06:55	...maybe who.
60	00:06:55	00:07:02	See, the vic was alone in his office with that guy for approximately seven minutes before buzzkill.
61	00:07:02	00:07:06	So, now all we need to do is figure out who that guy is.
62	00:07:06	00:07:09	Yeah. Let me see what I can do.
63	00:07:10	00:07:12	All right.
64	00:07:19	00:07:21	Are you trying to do my job?
65	00:07:21	00:07:24	Eh... yes, a little.
66	00:07:24	00:07:28	Mandy had dusted everything for fingerprints, and unfortunately, she came up empty.
67	00:07:28	00:07:29	But look at this.
68	00:07:29	00:07:38	I think that these fragments, the ones that Gareth found so delicious, I think that they used to be a vase that was actually stolen from the Iraqi National Museum.
69	00:07:38	00:07:47	I think it was smuggled in, like drug-dealer style because basically, all you have to do is take an antique vase, and you wrap it up in a bunch of cellophane, right?
70	00:07:47	00:07:58	You fill it with some little plastic doodads and candy and slap a Made in China sticker on there, and that priceless piece of art can just sail though US Customs like a Tijuana piÃ±ata. (phone chirps)
71	00:07:58	00:07:59	Excuse me.
72	00:08:01	00:08:03	I hate actors.
73	00:08:03	00:08:08	Okay, I have to go, but I would love to finish putting that back together when I'm done, if it's okay with you.
74	00:08:08	00:08:10	Mm-hmm. I love jigsaw puzzles.
75	00:09:09	00:09:11	So when was the last time you saw Mr. Pennington?
76	00:09:11	00:09:12	Uh, the other night at his party.
77	00:09:13	00:09:18	I've been acquiring Mesopotamian antiquities on behalf of the Marrakesh for an exhibit at our casino museum.
78	00:09:19	00:09:21	I purchased a piece from Mr. Pennington last month.
79	00:09:21	00:09:26	He called me and said he had a new Babylonian piece for sale, so I went to go see it.
80	00:09:26	00:09:28	It wasn't what I was looking for.
81	00:09:28	00:09:30	Why, because it was stolen?
82	00:09:30	00:09:33	Like from the National Museum of Iraq?
83	00:09:33	00:09:34	Before...
84	00:09:34	00:09:37	after.
85	00:09:37	00:09:42	Trafficking in stolen antiquities is illegal, and from what I hear, dangerous.
86	00:09:42	00:09:44	Which is why people get off on it.
87	00:09:44	00:09:46	Not me. Do you know who I work for?
88	00:09:46	00:09:47	Yeah, Bruce Curtis, CEO of Marrakesh Corporation.
89	00:09:47	00:09:49	I've met him.
90	00:09:49	00:09:53	Then you know if he found out I compromised his reputation with something like this...
91	00:09:53	00:09:54	You'd be ancient history.
92	00:09:54	00:09:58	Look, I don't know who killed Mr. Pennington, but it wasn't me.
93	00:09:58	00:10:03	And if he was dealing with the black market, then maybe he got what was coming to him.
94	00:10:03	00:10:06	Stupid lousy jigsaw puzzle.
95	00:10:06	00:10:10	It's one stupid piece.
96	00:10:12	00:10:14	You looking for this, Wendy?
97	00:10:14	00:10:17	Yes.
98	00:10:17	00:10:19	Thank you.
99	00:10:27	00:10:29	Hmm.
100	00:10:29	00:10:31	It's done.
101	00:10:31	00:10:32	It's fake.
102	00:10:32	00:10:33	How do you know?
103	00:10:33	00:10:34	The cat told me.
104	00:10:36	00:10:40	You take a replica vase, you smear it with yogurt, you let it soak in.
105	00:10:40	00:10:44	Then you mix in minerals from the geographic area you're trying to fake.
106	00:10:44	00:10:47	You let it sit in a hot, dry place.
107	00:10:47	00:10:50	You let the Lactococcus lactis go to work...
108	00:10:50	00:10:59	This process visibly ages the piece and creates a true mineral match, which, according to my research, can fool experts and spectrographic analysis alike.
109	00:10:59	00:11:01	But not a hungry cat?
110	00:11:01	00:11:06	I have a man in Dubai whose brother is a curator.
111	00:11:06	00:11:11	The casino guy realized he'd been conned and was terrified his boss would find out.
112	00:11:14	00:11:15	What have you done?
113	00:11:15	00:11:17	Nothing, compared to what I'm going to do to you.
114	00:11:17	00:11:19	I want my money back!
115	00:11:19	00:11:23	He was a lot more cooperative as a victim of art fraud than he is as a suspect.
116	00:11:23	00:11:25	Killing Carsten wouldn't get his boss's money back.
117	00:11:26	00:11:27	No, so I checked Pennington's bank.
118	00:11:27	00:11:30	He withdrew over $100,000 the day before he died.
119	00:11:30	00:11:32	Sounds like Carsten was about to skip town.
120	00:11:32	00:11:34	That's funny his fiancÃ©e didn't mention that.
121	00:11:34	00:11:36	So, what's this about?
122	00:11:36	00:11:40	Ms. Farrell, were you aware that Mr. Pennington withdrew over $100,000 from his bank accounts yesterday?
123	00:11:41	00:11:43	Um... why?
124	00:11:44	00:11:46	Uh, no, I didn't know anything about that.
125	00:11:46	00:11:48	Then this'll be a short visit.
126	00:12:23	00:12:28	I found blood stains on Ms. Farrell's party dress. Oh.
127	00:12:28	00:12:29	It's been washed.
128	00:12:29	00:12:32	I look great in that dress.
129	00:12:32	00:12:36	I wanted to wear it out tonight, so I had to clean it-- it was dirty.
130	00:12:36	00:12:39	Those incriminating DNA stains can be so hard to get out.
131	00:12:40	00:12:44	Which is why professional criminals prefer chlorine bleach.
132	00:12:44	00:12:47	You use a nonenzymatic detergent.
133	00:12:47	00:12:50	Good for the environment... and DNA retrieval.
134	00:12:50	00:12:53	I want an attorney.
135	00:12:53	00:12:54	Sure, that's your right.
136	00:12:55	00:12:56	This is how I clean up the planet.
137	00:13:03	00:13:06	So you think she just didn't know that her fiancÃ© was an art faker?
138	00:13:06	00:13:11	She was living in a swanky house having swell parties and holding court with fine friends.
139	00:13:12	00:13:13	I don't think she really cared.
140	00:13:13	00:13:15	Nice work, Doctor.
141	00:13:15	00:13:17	Nice work to you, too, Simms.
142	00:13:17	00:13:18	Thank you.
143	00:13:18	00:13:19	Ray, excuse me.
144	00:13:19	00:13:21	Could you come in here for a minute?
145	00:13:21	00:13:22	You need to see this.
146	00:13:25	00:13:30	It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.
147	00:13:30	00:13:33	That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington.
148	00:13:33	00:13:36	It is.
149	00:13:36	00:13:37	And it isn't.
150	00:14:03	00:14:05	Second stage instar.
151	00:14:05	00:14:09	And since liver is fixed, she's been dead no more than 48 hours.
152	00:14:09	00:14:14	So, Jena Makin from Hollywood might have died on her 31st birthday.
153	00:14:15	00:14:17	No cell phone.
154	00:14:17	00:14:20	But if she has a number, we'll get the records from the carrier.
155	00:14:20	00:14:25	Bullets entered under the chin and exited the top of the skull.
156	00:14:25	00:14:29	Blood spatter and two holes in the ceiling.
157	00:14:29	00:14:33	Suggests that she was sitting up when she was shot.
158	00:14:33	00:14:34	Please... (gun hammer cocks)
159	00:14:42	00:14:45	Bullets look like .38s.
160	00:14:45	00:14:47	Probably a revolver.
161	00:14:47	00:14:48	No casings.
162	00:14:54	00:14:57	And they're oxidized.
163	00:14:57	00:15:00	Our killer doesn't know how to store ammunition.
164	00:15:01	00:15:03	Though it looks like he knows how to cover his tracks.
165	00:15:03	00:15:09	Got a couple possible wine glass stains here, but I don't remember seeing any wine or glasses in the room.
166	00:15:14	00:15:15	Strange-looking void.
167	00:15:25	00:15:28	Hello.
168	00:15:28	00:15:29	What is it?
169	00:15:35	00:15:37	A witness.
170	00:15:46	00:15:48	Oh, God.
171	00:15:52	00:15:55	COD's no mystery-- two GSWs to the head.
172	00:15:55	00:15:59	But I did find some abrasions in the vaginal vault.
173	00:15:59	00:16:00	Could indicate rape.
174	00:16:01	00:16:03	Or rough consensual sex.
175	00:16:03	00:16:06	Either way, the, uh, wet mount was negative for semen.
176	00:16:06	00:16:08	How considerate.
177	00:16:08	00:16:09	He wore a condom.
178	00:16:11	00:16:13	Busy night.
179	00:16:18	00:16:22	Well, the blood void means that the tortoise was there during the shooting.
180	00:16:22	00:16:26	And this print has got to belong to the killer.
181	00:16:29	00:16:30	Mandy, what are you thinking?
182	00:16:30	00:16:32	The ASPCA is gonna shut us down.
183	00:16:32	00:16:35	Mandy?
184	00:16:35	00:16:37	The Amido black.
185	00:16:37	00:16:38	It's minimally toxic; it won't hurt him.
186	00:16:39	00:16:40	I'll be gentle.
187	00:16:41	00:16:44	Wonder if he's a rare species.
188	00:16:44	00:16:47	'Cause I read that African tortoises can be worth as much as $10,000.
189	00:16:47	00:16:48	Just please hurry, okay?
190	00:16:48	00:16:51	'Cause he's been traumatized enough already.
191	00:16:51	00:16:54	He's a material witness in a homicide investigation.
192	00:16:54	00:16:55	I meant traumatized by you.
193	00:16:58	00:17:01	So who brings a tortoise to a gunfight?
194	00:17:01	00:17:06	If the killer was trying to take it with him after he killed the girl, then it stands to reason that the killer brought it in the first place.
195	00:17:06	00:17:09	Or maybe it was hers, which is why he killed her.
196	00:17:09	00:17:10	You just said they're valuable.
197	00:17:10	00:17:12	I got a hit.
198	00:17:12	00:17:13	Uh, Mickey Ross.
199	00:17:13	00:17:15	The Mickey Ross?
200	00:17:15	00:17:18	Who's Mickey Ross?
201	00:17:18	00:17:22	Mickey Ross is only the star of the Crimson Orchid film franchise.
202	00:17:22	00:17:26	Ross plays Dr. Harley Copen, physician by day, vigilante by night.
203	00:17:26	00:17:30	But he doesn't kill anyone; he shoots them in the street, and then he fixes them up in the E.R.
204	00:17:30	00:17:37	Rumor had it that Ross had actual intercourse with his co-star Ginger Snuff.
205	00:17:37	00:17:40	But a frame-by-frame analysis unfortunately disproved that.
206	00:17:40	00:17:41	I'll call LAPD.
207	00:17:41	00:17:44	I wonder if actor man owns a .38.
208	00:17:46	00:17:49	Okay, I just need you to open your...
209	00:17:49	00:17:50	mouth.
210	00:17:53	00:17:54	That tickles. (giggles)
211	00:17:54	00:17:56	They searched his place in Hollywood, no gun.
212	00:17:56	00:17:57	But they found these.
213	00:17:57	00:17:59	They don't make that ammo anymore.
214	00:18:02	00:18:07	It's the same caliber, same brand, same oxidation.
215	00:18:07	00:18:09	He's a triple threat.
216	00:18:09	00:18:13	You let me know what comes back from the...
217	00:18:13	00:18:15	electrophoresis gel.
218	00:18:15	00:18:17	It's how they blood-type DNA. Mm.
219	00:18:17	00:18:19	I played a medical examiner in Killer Instinct 3.
220	00:18:19	00:18:24	Well, I'll catch that on the History Channel, 'cause we stopped blood-typing about 15 years ago.
221	00:18:24	00:18:26	Ah.
222	00:18:26	00:18:28	Is he hitting on you?
223	00:18:28	00:18:29	Yeah, but not very well.
224	00:18:29	00:18:35	(phone beeps) Mm, and luckily I have to go, 'cause somebody lost a contact lens.
225	00:18:40	00:18:43	Look, this is just a big misunderstanding, Detective.
226	00:18:43	00:18:44	Mm-hmm.
227	00:18:44	00:18:46	I loved Jena; I would never hurt her.
228	00:18:46	00:18:48	Where were you two nights ago?
229	00:18:48	00:18:49	I was in LA.
230	00:18:49	00:18:50	Wrong.
231	00:18:50	00:18:52	You were with Jena in her motel room.
232	00:18:52	00:18:53	No, I was in LA.
233	00:18:53	00:18:55	Save it.
234	00:18:55	00:18:56	The tortoise gave you up, man.
235	00:18:56	00:18:58	We found your prints on his shell in Jena's blood.
236	00:18:59	00:19:01	Wait a minute, you have Gareth?
237	00:19:01	00:19:02	Is he okay? Can I see him?
238	00:19:02	00:19:05	That puts you at the murder, jackass.
239	00:19:08	00:19:09	All right, okay.
240	00:19:09	00:19:10	Yeah, I-I was there.
241	00:19:10	00:19:11	Right.
242	00:19:11	00:19:13	But I didn't kill her.
243	00:19:13	00:19:16	Jena was going through some stuff.
244	00:19:16	00:19:19	Okay? So she wanted to go to Vegas to, uh...
245	00:19:19	00:19:21	pick herself up, have a little fun.
246	00:19:21	00:19:22	You know?
247	00:19:22	00:19:25	So I thought I'd just drop in on her, and I brought Gareth.
248	00:19:25	00:19:27	She loved that tortoise.
249	00:19:29	00:19:38	But when I got to the... room, I found her dead with a gun in her hand.
250	00:19:38	00:19:43	And instead of calling the police, you cleaned up the scene, you took the gun and her cell phone, and you went back to LA.
251	00:19:43	00:19:46	Yes, because I knew how bad it looked.
252	00:19:47	00:19:48	Do you have any idea...
253	00:19:48	00:19:51	any idea at all how... this makes me feel?
254	00:19:51	00:19:54	To not know that my wife was suicidal...
255	00:19:54	00:19:56	my own wife!
256	00:19:56	00:20:01	But I was too self-absorbed to even recognize her pain.
257	00:20:01	00:20:07	Jena was the one real thing in my life.
258	00:20:07	00:20:09	Jena! Jena!
259	00:20:09	00:20:13	You think I'm just gonna let you play me like a bitch while you run off with that piece of crap?
260	00:20:13	00:20:16	You know me better than that, you whore!
261	00:20:18	00:20:22	See, you can ditch a gun, you can toss a cell phone, but voice mails are forever.
262	00:20:22	00:20:26	Even when you delete them off your own phone, huh?
263	00:20:50	00:20:52	She didn't kill herself, Mickey.
264	00:20:52	00:20:53	Give it up.
265	00:20:53	00:20:54	You're nailed.
266	00:20:55	00:20:56	This is all because of Tripp.
267	00:20:56	00:20:57	No, this is all because of you.
268	00:20:57	00:21:00	Tripp Linson-- he's a producer I met four years ago.
269	00:21:00	00:21:03	He was gonna produce my comeback feature, Enemy of the People.
270	00:21:03	00:21:05	It was written up in Variety, maybe you saw it.
271	00:21:05	00:21:07	Come on, Mickey!
272	00:21:07	00:21:11	This guy talks me out of 200 Gs to invest in his little movie, okay?
273	00:21:11	00:21:14	And then he talks his way into my wife's pants.
274	00:21:14	00:21:16	They become a thing.
275	00:21:16	00:21:17	But I forgive her.
276	00:21:17	00:21:21	Then a couple of days ago, I go to the house, and I get this little note.
277	00:21:21	00:21:24	The note says, We're done.
278	00:21:24	00:21:27	She's gonna run off with Tripp.
279	00:21:27	00:21:29	So I check the credit card company, find out where she is.
280	00:21:29	00:21:31	I go to the motel, and I find her.
281	00:21:31	00:21:34	She's in there, and she's just crying her eyes out.
282	00:21:34	00:21:37	She found Tripp, but he...
283	00:21:37	00:21:40	the bastard pretended he didn't even know who she was.
284	00:21:42	00:21:45	Gareth cheered her up. (sniffles)
285	00:21:45	00:21:48	And then we... we recommitted to each other.
286	00:21:48	00:21:49	You recommitted?
287	00:21:49	00:21:50	The ME called it rape-murder.
288	00:21:50	00:21:53	Rather than be with me...
289	00:21:56	00:21:59	...my wife killed herself.
290	00:21:59	00:22:02	This is our second chance.
291	00:22:02	00:22:04	You and me, baby! Forever!
292	00:22:13	00:22:15	That's a nice try, Mickey.
293	00:22:16	00:22:19	But when people blow their brains out, they only pull the trigger once.
294	00:22:19	00:22:21	Now, Jena...
295	00:22:21	00:22:23	was shot twice.
296	00:22:23	00:22:25	No, that's not possible.
297	00:22:25	00:22:27	I was there-- I only heard one shot.
298	00:22:31	00:22:33	One shot.
299	00:22:33	00:22:36	Sometimes the gunpowder in old ammunition doesn't burn completely.
300	00:22:36	00:22:41	This results in shallow rifling marks on the bullet, which only gets partway down the barrel.
301	00:22:41	00:22:51	If you don't realize what's happened and you try again, the second bullet impacts the first, leaving an indentation in the base and forcing both bullets out of the barrel.
302	00:22:51	00:22:54	And that... is how you get a twofer.
303	00:23:05	00:23:08	This is our second chance.
304	00:23:10	00:23:12	You and me, baby!
305	00:23:12	00:23:14	Forever!
306	00:23:16	00:23:18	What do you know.
307	00:23:18	00:23:21	Mickey Ross was telling the truth.
308	00:23:23	00:23:24	Tripp, can you give us a second?
309	00:23:25	00:23:29	Look, you know what you get when you have... you have the perfect actor in the perfect part in the perfect script?
310	00:23:30	00:23:32	immortality.
311	00:23:32	00:23:36	I'm not gonna even have to ask Mickey to act-- this guy has lived this.
312	00:23:36	00:23:37	Tripp Linson is awesome.
313	00:23:37	00:23:39	Jena, what have you got there?
314	00:23:39	00:23:41	Not what. Who.
315	00:23:41	00:23:43	Say hello, Gareth.
316	00:23:44	00:23:46	He's a gift.
317	00:23:46	00:23:47	For Mickey.
318	00:23:47	00:23:49	Um, slow and steady wins the race, dude.
319	00:23:49	00:23:51	We start filming this summer.
320	00:23:51	00:23:53	Go see this movie. You're never going to regret it.
321	00:23:53	00:23:54	Ray, excuse me.
322	00:23:54	00:23:56	Could you come in here for a minute?
323	00:23:56	00:23:58	You need to see this.
324	00:23:59	00:24:03	It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.
325	00:24:03	00:24:06	That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington.
326	00:24:06	00:24:08	It is.
327	00:24:08	00:24:09	And it isn't.
328	00:24:10	00:24:12	Hey, do either one of you recognize this guy-- Ryan Morton?
329	00:24:12	00:24:14	He kind of looks...
330	00:24:14	00:24:16	familiar.
331	00:24:37	00:24:39	Oh...
332	00:24:39	00:24:42	I think I just threw out my back. Seriously?
333	00:24:42	00:24:44	Oh...
334	00:24:44	00:24:45	I'm good. (grunts) (bones crack)
335	00:24:45	00:24:47	No, no, come on out of there, Super Dave.
336	00:24:47	00:24:48	Take a break; we'll get him.
337	00:24:48	00:24:50	Jimmy, get him out of there for me, will ya?
338	00:24:50	00:24:52	You all right? Yeah.
339	00:24:54	00:24:56	Easy. There you go.
340	00:24:56	00:24:58	There's a body shoved under the steering column.
341	00:24:58	00:25:03	So, I think it's safe to say somebody didn't want him to be found.
342	00:25:03	00:25:06	No shell casings, no apparent blood.
343	00:25:06	00:25:08	Phone.
344	00:25:08	00:25:10	Did you get an ID on him?
345	00:25:10	00:25:12	Here you go.
346	00:25:13	00:25:15	His name's Shawn Hagan.
347	00:25:15	00:25:19	He's a PI from Tahoe.
348	00:25:19	00:25:21	(bone cracking) Wow. Rigor is fully developed.
349	00:25:21	00:25:24	Makes TOD at least six to 12 hours ago.
350	00:25:24	00:25:26	No petechial hemorrhaging.
351	00:25:26	00:25:29	And no bruising on the neck.
352	00:25:29	00:25:31	So maybe a heart attack?
353	00:25:31	00:25:33	Or an OD?
354	00:25:33	00:25:35	But I don't see any drug paraphernalia around here.
355	00:25:36	00:25:41	The rental agreement said he picked up the car four days ago in LA.
356	00:25:41	00:25:45	Yeah, and it looks like he was expensing it at $160 a day to a client.
357	00:25:45	00:25:51	Well, if he bills clients like that for heaps like these, we're gonna have a lot of suspects.
358	00:25:53	00:25:55	Lucky you were visiting Vegas, Dr. Anton.
359	00:25:55	00:25:57	What's your business with Shawn Hagan?
360	00:25:57	00:25:58	It's a personal matter.
361	00:25:59	00:26:01	Why do you want to know?
362	00:26:01	00:26:04	Mr. Hagan's case files are on their way down from Tahoe.
363	00:26:04	00:26:07	So nothing's gonna remain personal very long.
364	00:26:07	00:26:11	Mr. Hagan is helping me find a former business associate.
365	00:26:11	00:26:12	That's personal?
366	00:26:12	00:26:14	It's a private matter.
367	00:26:14	00:26:16	Have a seat.
368	00:26:18	00:26:20	Shawn Hagan was murdered last night.
369	00:26:22	00:26:25	Where were you?
370	00:26:25	00:26:29	In my hotel room, all night, watching movies.
371	00:26:29	00:26:33	If Shawn Hagan is dead, Ryan Morton had something to do with it.
372	00:26:33	00:26:36	Let me guess, that would be your business associate, right?
373	00:26:36	00:26:38	You know where we might find him?
374	00:26:38	00:26:40	No.
375	00:26:40	00:26:44	That's what Mr. Hagan was supposed to find out.
376	00:26:44	00:26:46	Here.
377	00:26:46	00:26:48	That's as much as I know.
378	00:26:49	00:26:52	I doubt it'll do you any good.
379	00:26:57	00:27:00	This reminds me of David's back.
380	00:27:07	00:27:08	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
381	00:27:10	00:27:12	Hang on a second.
382	00:27:17	00:27:19	Looks like a contact lens.
383	00:27:23	00:27:25	He's not wearing the other one.
384	00:27:27	00:27:29	Could be from the killer.
385	00:27:29	00:27:33	I'll get it to Wendy, have her run the clothes for touch DNA as well.
386	00:27:42	00:27:45	Nick, this is a gunshot wound.
387	00:27:45	00:27:46	Palm-side entry.
388	00:27:46	00:27:49	Sooting says that it's a contact wound.
389	00:27:49	00:27:50	Through and through?
390	00:27:50	00:27:52	Yeah. Hmm.
391	00:27:52	00:27:54	Then why didn't we find the bullet anywhere?
392	00:27:54	00:27:57	Or blood.
393	00:28:02	00:28:04	Whew.
394	00:28:04	00:28:07	Hagan grabs the gun in the course of the struggle. (gunshot)
395	00:28:08	00:28:16	The bullet tracks along the skin inside the sleeve, reenters the torso, and deflects off a rib into both lungs, then off another rib into the diaphragm...
396	00:28:17	00:28:19	finally coming to rest in the spleen.
397	00:28:22	00:28:24	Ballistic pinball.
398	00:28:24	00:28:27	More or less.
399	00:28:27	00:28:28	Hmm.
400	00:28:34	00:28:36	Brass-washed .22.
401	00:28:37	00:28:39	High-penetration round.
402	00:28:39	00:28:44	Bullets sometimes take a long and winding road before they reach their ultimate destination.
403	00:28:45	00:28:46	Some people, too.
404	00:28:55	00:28:58	Lake Tahoe-- the Golden West.
405	00:28:58	00:29:00	This is where fortunes are made.
406	00:29:00	00:29:03	Hi. My name is Ryan Morton, and I want to make you rich.
407	00:29:03	00:29:12	This country was forged by wildcat entrepreneurs who struck out across an untamed continent to find mountains of timber and rivers of gold.
408	00:29:13	00:29:18	Those mother lodes are still out there waiting for those who dare to dream.
409	00:29:20	00:29:22	Looks like Gareth thinks so, too.
410	00:29:22	00:29:28	Your investment in Royal Tahoe property can yield a 24% return, or even higher.
411	00:29:28	00:29:33	For a taste of the frontier spirit that made America great, give me a call.
412	00:29:35	00:29:39	It's hard to believe people actually fall for this crap. I don't know.
413	00:29:39	00:29:42	Have you ever known anyone to hit a royal flush playing video poker?
414	00:29:42	00:29:43	Oh, of course. So...
415	00:29:43	00:29:44	then it could happen to you, right?
416	00:29:45	00:29:51	(chuckles) You know, there's something about this guy that looks familiar.
417	00:29:51	00:29:53	Hey.
418	00:29:53	00:29:58	Look what Sanitation turned up in a Dumpster two blocks from Shawn Hagan's murder scene.
419	00:29:58	00:29:59	.22 caliber? Yeah.
420	00:29:59	00:30:01	Nice. Same as the bullet.
421	00:30:01	00:30:03	Did you run ballistics?
422	00:30:03	00:30:04	Oh, I will.
423	00:30:04	00:30:06	But it's got a serial number.
424	00:30:06	00:30:07	Guess who it's registered to.
425	00:30:07	00:30:13	Ballistics confirms your gun fired the bullet that killed Shawn Hagan.
426	00:30:13	00:30:17	This gun hasn't been in my possession for years.
427	00:30:17	00:30:18	So, what, you misplaced it?
428	00:30:19	00:30:21	No. I gave it to Ryan Morton.
429	00:30:21	00:30:23	It was a gift.
430	00:30:23	00:30:25	Can you prove that?
431	00:30:25	00:30:27	No. Have you found him yet?
432	00:30:27	00:30:28	We got a broadcast out.
433	00:30:28	00:30:31	And he'll turn up. Hagan said he found him.
434	00:30:31	00:30:32	Here's what I think happened.
435	00:30:32	00:30:39	I think Hagan told you he found Ryan in Las Vegas, but then he decided he wanted more money than you agreed upon for delivery.
436	00:30:39	00:30:43	So you arranged to meet Hagan in his car, but you weren't gonna be jerked around anymore.
437	00:30:43	00:30:45	That's why you decided to bring your gun. No.
438	00:30:45	00:30:46	There's a struggle.
439	00:30:47	00:30:48	He grabs the gun, and bam!
440	00:30:48	00:30:51	I had nothing to do with that! Hey, hey, hey, hey.
441	00:30:51	00:30:55	We understand that sometimes things just get out of control.
442	00:30:55	00:30:57	But you need to be truthful.
443	00:30:57	00:31:02	If you did not intend to shoot him... I did not shoot him!
444	00:31:03	00:31:05	Then you tell me what happened.
445	00:31:09	00:31:11	Look, I met Ryan...
446	00:31:11	00:31:14	at a tennis club in Tahoe.
447	00:31:14	00:31:19	He grew up in Tonopah, not far from where I did.
448	00:31:20	00:31:24	He was developing a lot of real estate.
449	00:31:24	00:31:27	He was very ambitious.
450	00:31:27	00:31:36	I lost my boy years ago in a divorce, and Ryan told me that his father had abandoned his family before he was born.
451	00:31:38	00:31:41	I gave him the gun for his birthday.
452	00:31:41	00:31:44	And then he got you to give him some real money.
453	00:31:48	00:31:53	He said he needed a completion loan for a house he was gonna flip.
454	00:31:53	00:31:56	$175,000.
455	00:31:56	00:32:01	And I find out one day he left town.
456	00:32:01	00:32:04	Didn't even have a title to the house.
457	00:32:04	00:32:05	Why didn't you go to the police?
458	00:32:05	00:32:07	I'm a cardiac surgeon.
459	00:32:07	00:32:11	My patients, my staff-- they have to have confidence in my judgment.
460	00:32:11	00:32:15	If they'd heard that I've been played like a rube...
461	00:32:15	00:32:16	Do you wear contact lenses?
462	00:32:16	00:32:17	Yes. Why?
463	00:32:18	00:32:19	DNA sample.
464	00:32:19	00:32:21	I'm gonna need one.
465	00:32:22	00:32:25	Take whatever you need.
466	00:32:27	00:32:29	Ray, excuse me.
467	00:32:29	00:32:31	Could you come in here for a minute?
468	00:32:31	00:32:33	You need to see this.
469	00:32:35	00:32:39	It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.
470	00:32:39	00:32:41	That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington.
471	00:32:41	00:32:43	It is. And it isn't.
472	00:32:43	00:32:47	Hey, do either one of you recognize this guy-- Ryan Morton?
473	00:32:49	00:32:51	Hey, Nick. Yeah?
474	00:32:51	00:32:58	The DNA from the doctor didn't match the sample from the contact lens, and then CODIS drew a blank, so just to be thorough, I ran it against all the other case profiles.
475	00:32:58	00:33:00	And you got a match? I got a sibling match.
476	00:33:00	00:33:05	That contact lens DNA had seven alleles in common with Carsten Pennington.
477	00:33:05	00:33:07	AKA Tripp Linson.
478	00:33:07	00:33:08	AKA Ryan Morton.
479	00:33:08	00:33:10	He's got a brother.
480	00:33:10	00:33:12	Who just might be our killer.
481	00:33:14	00:33:16	Gareth Morton? The brother's name is Gareth?
482	00:33:16	00:33:17	Yes, like the cat.
483	00:33:17	00:33:18	And the tortoise.
484	00:33:18	00:33:20	And the dog.
485	00:33:21	00:33:22	Some people.
486	00:33:22	00:33:24	It's no surprise when they end up dead.
487	00:33:25	00:33:27	We checked the local records in Tonopah.
488	00:33:27	00:33:31	Ryan and Gareth Morton own a house that was left to them by their mother.
489	00:33:31	00:33:33	We tried to contact Gareth there.
490	00:33:33	00:33:35	No answer. Local PD couldn't find him.
491	00:33:35	00:33:42	I had Archie go back over the surveillance at Carsten's cocktail party and guess what?
492	00:33:42	00:33:45	We found Gareth.
493	00:33:51	00:33:55	That places Gareth in Las Vegas the night of Carsten's murder.
494	00:33:55	00:33:57	Okay.
495	00:33:57	00:33:59	Quick timeline...
496	00:33:59	00:34:04	Jena Makin sees her old flame Tripp in a Vegas magazine.
497	00:34:04	00:34:07	She makes a last-ditch attempt for love.
498	00:34:07	00:34:11	She finds Tripp and throws herself at him.
499	00:34:11	00:34:13	Unfortunately, he's not Tripp anymore.
500	00:34:13	00:34:18	He's Carsten Pennington, art dealer, living in a rented mansion, so he claims he doesn't recognize her.
501	00:34:18	00:34:23	And Jena goes back to the motel and blows her brains out.
502	00:34:23	00:34:34	A day later, a PI tracking down real estate fraudster Ryan Morton meets his brother Gareth and probably by accident, Gareth kills the PI in his car.
503	00:34:34	00:34:43	Then, later that night, Gareth shows up at Carsten's party-- uninvited, no doubt-- smashes his head in, dumps him in the pool.
504	00:34:43	00:34:45	And brother Gareth's in the wind.
505	00:34:45	00:34:48	His description's out on broadcast. (phone beeping)
506	00:34:48	00:34:53	But right now, that's about all we can do. If he's smart, he's not in the country.
507	00:34:53	00:34:56	Apparently, he's not that smart.
508	00:35:00	00:35:03	Speeding, Gareth, is a crime.
509	00:35:03	00:35:11	And when you have a bench warrant for a couple unpaid parking tickets, that gets you a couple of days lockup in Pahrump.
510	00:35:11	00:35:13	What do you think this gets you?
511	00:35:13	00:35:14	Check this out.
512	00:35:14	00:35:16	Look closely.
513	00:35:16	00:35:19	That's your contact lens.
514	00:35:19	00:35:23	That's your DNA on a dead guy.
515	00:35:23	00:35:26	Want to tell me how it got there?
516	00:35:26	00:35:31	Hagan came to see me in Tonopah, four days ago.
517	00:35:33	00:35:34	He slapped me.
518	00:35:34	00:35:37	Now, why would he go and do a mean thing like that?
519	00:35:37	00:35:41	'Cause he wanted 175K that Ryan stole from his client.
520	00:35:41	00:35:46	I-I told Hagan I hadn't heard from Ryan in years.
521	00:35:46	00:35:48	That his debts weren't my problem.
522	00:35:48	00:35:50	Hmm.
523	00:35:50	00:35:56	And he said, oh, well, they were now because Ma left him half of the house.
524	00:35:56	00:35:58	They put a lien on it.
525	00:35:58	00:36:10	He told me that Ryan was living in Vegas under the name Carsten Pennington, and he was living in a mansion and rolling in dough.
526	00:36:10	00:36:16	So, there you are, sitting up in a shack in Tonopah, in a house you don't even own free and clear because of your brother and Mr. Hagan.
527	00:36:16	00:36:18	That must have chapped your ass, huh?
528	00:36:18	00:36:21	Yeah, that house should have been mine.
529	00:36:21	00:36:25	31 years I lived in that house with Ma.
530	00:36:25	00:36:33	Hauled her to church, to the beauty parlor, even changed her diapers in the end.
531	00:36:36	00:36:38	And all she ever talked about was Ryan.
532	00:36:38	00:36:39	Sure, okay.
533	00:36:39	00:36:44	So you left for Vegas, you know, with the Mom always loved you best rage, right?
534	00:36:44	00:36:46	Then what? You found Hagan and killed him?
535	00:36:46	00:36:48	I didn't kill Hagan.
536	00:36:48	00:36:51	Look, I went to see Ryan.
537	00:36:51	00:36:59	I hung outside his-his party until all the other guests had left, and then I asked him to quitclaim the house to me.
538	00:36:59	00:37:01	Why the hell should I?
539	00:37:01	00:37:02	Mom wanted me to have half.
540	00:37:02	00:37:04	I'm not gonna deny her dying wish.
541	00:37:04	00:37:06	You never gave a rat's ass about her.
542	00:37:06	00:37:12	Every-every birthday, every Christmas she was waiting for a card or a phone call or something.
543	00:37:12	00:37:13	And never, not one word from you.
544	00:37:13	00:37:16	And still, you were all she was thinking about.
545	00:37:16	00:37:21	So I'm supposed to feel guilty because you decided to chain yourself to that sadistic bitch?
546	00:37:21	00:37:24	After all the things she did to us?
547	00:37:24	00:37:26	You want to know why I was her favorite?
548	00:37:26	00:37:29	Because I had the guts to get out.
549	00:37:29	00:37:31	To live my own life.
550	00:37:31	00:37:33	Hell, I've lived five lives.
551	00:37:33	00:37:35	You didn't have the guts to live one.
552	00:37:35	00:37:37	Then what?
553	00:37:37	00:37:40	And then... I left.
554	00:37:40	00:37:43	You left? You just walked away?
555	00:37:43	00:37:44	Why?
556	00:37:44	00:37:46	Because he was right about me-- I'm weak.
557	00:37:46	00:37:48	What do you mean?
558	00:37:49	00:37:56	When we were growing up, you know, all the kids in the neighborhood crowded around him, and...
559	00:37:58	00:38:01	...I just faded into his shadow.
560	00:38:03	00:38:06	He had this charisma.
561	00:38:10	00:38:14	He was electric.
562	00:38:14	00:38:19	And even after all this went down, I still... I still loved him.
563	00:38:23	00:38:28	I just didn't have the courage to tell him.
564	00:38:30	00:38:31	Isn't this sweet?
565	00:38:31	00:38:34	He drives Mommy's old Cutlass to go commit murder.
566	00:38:35	00:38:41	Okay, this is everything Gareth had on him or with him at the time he was arrested.
567	00:38:49	00:38:50	One contact lens missing.
568	00:38:50	00:38:53	That's bad news for Gareth.
569	00:39:10	00:39:13	What do we have here?
570	00:39:13	00:39:15	This is about a hundred grand.
571	00:39:15	00:39:18	Maybe he figures a car trunk is safer than a 401(k).
572	00:39:18	00:39:20	These days, he's probably right.
573	00:39:41	00:39:43	These are Burberrys.
574	00:39:43	00:39:47	Everything else here is from Dempsey's bargain basement.
575	00:39:47	00:39:51	What's a half-broke kid from Tonopah doing in a $50 pair of underwear?
576	00:39:51	00:39:54	I think I can answer that.
577	00:39:54	00:39:59	Because the body we fished out of Carsten Pennington's pool was wearing Dempsey's underwear.
578	00:39:59	00:40:02	We found a hundred grand in your car.
579	00:40:02	00:40:04	Ryan gave it to me.
580	00:40:04	00:40:07	Why didn't you tell us about it?
581	00:40:07	00:40:09	Taxes.
582	00:40:09	00:40:11	I didn't want to pay taxes on it.
583	00:40:12	00:40:13	I'm sure Ryan didn't.
584	00:40:13	00:40:17	Ryan wouldn't sign a quitclaim for the house, and he gives you $100,000 free and clear?
585	00:40:17	00:40:21	That sounds a tad inconsistent.
586	00:40:21	00:40:23	Look, I don't pretend to understand my brother.
587	00:40:24	00:40:25	All right?
588	00:40:25	00:40:28	But why-why would I kill him when he gave me that money?
589	00:40:28	00:40:29	Look, all brothers fight.
590	00:40:29	00:40:31	I threw my brother through a screen door.
591	00:40:31	00:40:33	He broke a bowl of oatmeal on my head.
592	00:40:34	00:40:36	But I can't imagine killing him.
593	00:40:36	00:40:37	So, help me understand.
594	00:40:37	00:40:42	I think this thing started in the house in Tonopah, and ended in that swimming pool.
595	00:40:42	00:40:44	He's going to go down for this, Darcy.
596	00:40:46	00:40:50	The only question is, are you going to go down with him?
597	00:40:50	00:40:55	If I were you, I would take a hard look at that bimbo of his.
598	00:40:55	00:40:58	What's her name, Darcy?
599	00:40:58	00:41:01	When Ryan gave me the cash, she freaked out.
600	00:41:01	00:41:05	She was really pissed, and there was murder in her eyes.
601	00:41:05	00:41:08	You guys should check her out.
602	00:41:08	00:41:11	That's not Gareth.
603	00:41:11	00:41:12	It's Carsten.
604	00:41:12	00:41:17	Every Christmas and birthday she'd wait for a card or a phone call, something.
605	00:41:17	00:41:18	Not one word, ever.
606	00:41:18	00:41:21	And still... you were all she thought about at the end.
607	00:41:21	00:41:22	I said shut up!
608	00:41:30	00:41:32	Carsten?
609	00:41:35	00:41:39	He said that Gareth threatened to kill us both.
610	00:41:39	00:41:42	That there was no other way out.
611	00:41:45	00:41:50	He took Gareth's identity and said he'd come back for me.
612	00:41:50	00:41:53	And I believed him.
613	00:42:02	00:42:06	It's not true what my brother says about me.
614	00:42:06	00:42:09	I tried to make amends, but he wouldn't let me.
615	00:42:14	00:42:15	Here, Ma.
616	00:42:15	00:42:18	I want you to have this.
617	00:42:18	00:42:20	Ryan, I can't.
618	00:42:22	00:42:24	What the hell is that?
619	00:42:26	00:42:28	We don't need your help.
620	00:42:28	00:42:30	We're getting by just fine.
621	00:42:30	00:42:33	What, on your-your lousy, uh, $450 a week?
622	00:42:33	00:42:34	You're lucky Mom's here, or I'd...
623	00:42:34	00:42:37	What? Boys, don't fight.
624	00:42:37	00:42:39	You haven't changed a bit.
625	00:42:40	00:42:41	Don't forget your money.
626	00:42:42	00:42:43	You need it more than us.
627	00:42:43	00:42:46	It's the, uh... only thing you ever loved.
628	00:42:52	00:42:55	Wow...
629	00:42:55	00:42:59	That is so... sad.
630	00:42:59	00:43:03	What old movie did you steal it from?
631	00:43:05	00:43:08	Well, you're just one lie wrapped in another, huh?
632	00:43:09	00:43:12	It's the truth.
633	00:43:16	00:43:18	Even if it never happened.
