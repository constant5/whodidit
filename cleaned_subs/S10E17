0	00:00:18	00:00:20	Try extrapolate.
1	00:00:27	00:00:29	You want to do me another favor?
2	00:00:29	00:00:30	Uh-uh.
3	00:00:30	00:00:32	Get Rocket to stop barking?
4	00:00:32	00:00:34	It's your turn to bring him in.
5	00:00:34	00:00:36	Hmm.
6	00:00:48	00:00:52	I bet he's harassing that poor little possum again.
7	00:01:14	00:01:16	Lisa!
8	00:01:18	00:01:19	(Lisa screaming) Lisa!
9	00:01:27	00:01:31	What the hell is wrong with you?
10	00:01:31	00:01:36	Now you're really in trouble.
11	00:01:36	00:01:38	Lisa!
12	00:01:58	00:02:01	As soon as I saw their dog, I knew something was wrong.
13	00:02:01	00:02:04	Then I saw the door open and Ms. Layman inside.
14	00:02:04	00:02:05	You touch anything?
15	00:02:05	00:02:07	No, sir. I just called 911.
16	00:02:09	00:02:11	No shell casings.
17	00:02:11	00:02:13	None here either.
18	00:02:13	00:02:15	Weapon was probably a revolver.
19	00:02:15	00:02:19	Wife hears the commotion, comes out...
20	00:02:19	00:02:21	She struggles with the killer.
21	00:02:22	00:02:23	He drops her.
22	00:02:23	00:02:25	Lisa, honey, what's wrong?!
23	00:02:41	00:02:45	Got a partial shoe impression.
24	00:02:45	00:02:46	Generic worker boot.
25	00:02:46	00:02:47	Roughly 10 to 13.
26	00:02:50	00:02:53	We'll put a broadcast out on the daughter.
27	00:02:53	00:02:55	That's about all we can do for now.
28	00:02:56	00:02:59	Yeah, that's the one thing I hate most about this job.
29	00:03:04	00:03:05	Daddy! Daddy!
30	00:03:26	00:03:37	There's a wallet and a purse in the master bedroom, both filled with cash and cards, so this wasn't a home invasion robbery.
31	00:03:37	00:03:39	And looks like they came for Gracie.
32	00:03:39	00:03:41	Mm-hmm.
33	00:03:41	00:03:45	Tom Layman was a pit boss at the Palermo.
34	00:03:45	00:03:51	Lisa was working here at home as a freelance technical writer.
35	00:03:51	00:03:58	They were a regular middle-class family, not typical targets for kidnappers.
36	00:04:01	00:04:03	I don't see any blood.
37	00:04:13	00:04:14	There's a crawl trail here.
38	00:04:14	00:04:17	See that? Green fluorescence-- urine.
39	00:04:40	00:04:42	Gracie. Gracie, it's okay.
40	00:04:42	00:04:44	My name's Nick. I'm with the police department.
41	00:04:44	00:04:45	You're safe now.
42	00:04:45	00:04:48	Come here, honey.
43	00:04:48	00:04:49	Oh, baby, it's all right.
44	00:04:49	00:04:51	Come here. It's okay.
45	00:04:53	00:04:55	Aw.
46	00:04:57	00:04:59	It's okay.
47	00:04:59	00:05:00	Oh...
48	00:05:03	00:05:05	I got you, honey.
49	00:05:05	00:05:09	(sobbing) It's okay.
50	00:05:09	00:05:11	I got you.
51	00:06:17	00:06:21	(tapping) Hey, Sara, I found some fresh tool marks on the windowsill.
52	00:06:22	00:06:23	Looks like somebody jimmied it.
53	00:06:23	00:06:27	Well, the shooter definitely came in through the back door.
54	00:06:27	00:06:29	But maybe he did a little recon first.
55	00:06:33	00:06:38	In L.A., the Manson family used to do creepy crawls.
56	00:06:38	00:06:42	They would break into a house while the people were asleep and sneak around inside.
57	00:06:42	00:06:47	Knowing they had the power to end people's lives like that must have been a real turn-on for them.
58	00:06:50	00:06:51	Got a print.
59	00:07:49	00:07:53	Mandy got a hit off that print on the windowsill.
60	00:07:53	00:07:55	The gardener?
61	00:07:55	00:07:58	He's just going to say he left it when he was working around the house.
62	00:07:58	00:08:01	Yeah, well, I'm more interested in what the little girl has to say.
63	00:08:01	00:08:05	(sighs) Child witness-- that's not a lot to hang your hat on.
64	00:08:05	00:08:07	We got anything else?
65	00:08:07	00:08:10	Just some metallic trace in the killer's bootprint and on the wife's robe.
66	00:08:10	00:08:11	All right.
67	00:08:11	00:08:13	I'll let you know how it goes. Later.
68	00:08:22	00:08:27	Hey, Gracie.
69	00:08:27	00:08:28	You remember me?
70	00:08:28	00:08:29	Yeah?
71	00:08:29	00:08:31	Can I sit here with you?
72	00:08:34	00:08:37	I've got some good news for you.
73	00:08:37	00:08:40	Your Aunt Maggie's flying in from Boston to see you.
74	00:08:40	00:08:42	She's going to be here real soon.
75	00:08:42	00:08:46	But hey, listen, I'm stuck, and I need some help.
76	00:08:46	00:08:49	It's very important. You want to help me?
77	00:08:49	00:08:51	Hmm? Okay.
78	00:08:52	00:08:54	You know who he is?
79	00:08:56	00:08:57	He's our gardener.
80	00:08:57	00:08:59	Is he the guy you saw last night?
81	00:09:02	00:09:04	(gunshot, man groans) Daddy!
82	00:09:46	00:09:49	It was really dark, and...
83	00:09:51	00:09:54	I really couldn't see anything.
84	00:09:54	00:09:56	I'm sorry.
85	00:09:56	00:09:59	Hey, don't be scared, honey.
86	00:09:59	00:10:01	You're safe now.
87	00:10:01	00:10:03	Nobody's going to get you.
88	00:10:03	00:10:07	Is this the guy who hurt your parents?
89	00:10:12	00:10:16	It was him, right?
90	00:10:21	00:10:24	I'm glad you're feeling better.
91	00:10:24	00:10:28	So maybe I leaned against the window while trimming the bushes. So what?
92	00:10:28	00:10:30	So you're a convicted felon, that's what.
93	00:10:30	00:10:32	So you got a record, right?
94	00:10:32	00:10:34	B&amp;E, assault, grand larceny.
95	00:10:34	00:10:39	The gang unit tells me you were a member of the L.V. Marrones back in the day.
96	00:10:39	00:10:42	They also tell me three weeks ago, you were hanging at Jackson and K.
97	00:10:42	00:10:44	That's where the Marrones deal heroin.
98	00:10:44	00:10:45	But you know that anyway, right?
99	00:10:45	00:10:46	I'm not on probation anymore. Yeah.
100	00:10:47	00:10:50	Every once in a while I go by the old neighborhood, say hi to the homies.
101	00:10:50	00:10:51	Sure, I understand.
102	00:10:51	00:10:57	You want to go by the clubhouse, kick it, chill, drink some 40s, smoke some herb, watch football...
103	00:10:57	00:10:59	and plan some robberies and murders.
104	00:10:59	00:11:02	I don't run with those guys, and I didn't touch the Laymans.
105	00:11:02	00:11:08	I got a wife and a kid, and I've been doing it straight for nine years.
106	00:11:08	00:11:11	You guys just don't lay off a guy's ass, just hoping he's gonna screw up.
107	00:11:11	00:11:12	What's your shoe size?
108	00:11:12	00:11:14	Why?
109	00:11:14	00:11:15	Because I asked you. That's why.
110	00:11:16	00:11:17	Eleven.
111	00:11:17	00:11:18	Eleven.
112	00:11:18	00:11:21	You said the magic word. Give me your shoes.
113	00:11:23	00:11:28	Now you want to give them to me or you want me to get some professional in here to take them off you?
114	00:11:33	00:11:36	Look, I was never in that house.
115	00:11:36	00:11:38	Are you sure about that, homes?
116	00:11:38	00:11:42	Are you absolutely sure about that?
117	00:11:42	00:11:49	Because if I toss your place and I find one eensy-bitsy piece of swag from the Laymans...
118	00:11:49	00:11:54	Okay, fine.
119	00:11:54	00:11:56	I snuck in that window...
120	00:11:56	00:11:58	not last night, last week.
121	00:11:59	00:12:03	I looked inside, and I saw their kid playing with a brand-new video game box.
122	00:12:03	00:12:07	The old one was just sitting there on the shelf.
123	00:12:07	00:12:12	So I waited till they went out, I went inside, And I took it.
124	00:12:14	00:12:16	I make $60 a day pulling weeds and shoveling dog crap.
125	00:12:16	00:12:18	How do you think it feels?
126	00:12:18	00:12:20	I can't even afford to buy my kid one game.
127	00:12:24	00:12:28	I didn't kill anyone, I swear.
128	00:12:41	00:12:48	Gardener's boots had the same tread pattern as the crime scene impression, but there was no characteristic match.
129	00:12:48	00:12:50	And apparently, they're negative for blood.
130	00:12:50	00:12:53	There was no metallic trace on them either.
131	00:12:53	00:12:55	Any luck in Ballistics?
132	00:12:55	00:12:59	Well, the bullets we recovered were all .22s fired from the same gun.
133	00:12:59	00:13:03	Nothing in IBIS, so no real luck at all.
134	00:13:03	00:13:07	Luck is where opportunity meets preparation.
135	00:13:13	00:13:18	The metallic dust was a titanium alloy consisting of 4% vanadium and 6% aluminum.
136	00:13:19	00:13:20	That's an odd material to find in a garden.
137	00:13:21	00:13:25	Definitely. Titanium is widely used in aerospace and high-end tooling.
138	00:13:25	00:13:32	Based on the particle size and uniformity, my guess is, they came from a machine shop.
139	00:13:32	00:13:35	Titanium dust on the killer's boots and hands?
140	00:13:35	00:13:39	Maybe we're looking for an industrial worker?
141	00:13:41	00:13:46	You know, if there was dust on the inside of the house...
142	00:14:36	00:14:38	Thought you guys checked this house.
143	00:14:38	00:14:40	Twice. Both times, nobody home.
144	00:14:45	00:14:47	I got a blood smear.
145	00:14:52	00:14:54	It's unlocked.
146	00:14:54	00:14:57	Vegas Police!
147	00:14:58	00:14:59	Call for backup.
148	00:14:59	00:15:01	Control. Akers.
149	00:15:01	00:15:03	Two additional units backup at my location.
150	00:15:03	00:15:05	Copy, Akers, 105. (static crackles)
151	00:15:35	00:15:38	.22s.
152	00:17:48	00:17:49	Nick!
153	00:17:59	00:18:04	LVPD tell 8 News Now that they want to talk to retired machinist Jack Herson.
154	00:18:04	00:18:13	Herson, in his 50s, is a person of interest in the violent home invasion that shattered the calm in that normally quiet neighborhood.
155	00:18:13	00:18:16	Well, I'm pretty darn sure he hated that dog.
156	00:18:16	00:18:23	Furry bastard was always tearing up flower beds, chasing cats, barking at all hours.
157	00:18:23	00:18:25	Enough to drive anybody to murder.
158	00:19:03	00:19:11	Jack Herson owns a 12-shot .22-caliber revolver with the same GRCs as the murder bullets.
159	00:19:13	00:19:14	Any sign of the gun?
160	00:19:14	00:19:16	Hasn't turned up.
161	00:19:16	00:19:19	After what he did, he'd probably be keeping that with him.
162	00:19:20	00:19:21	We anywhere on his contacts?
163	00:19:21	00:19:24	His Internet service provider gave us access to all of his accounts.
164	00:19:24	00:19:26	There are hundreds of e-mails, hundreds of phone numbers.
165	00:19:26	00:19:31	The few with the same last names are relatives, and we know they're are all back east.
166	00:19:31	00:19:33	As for his friends...
167	00:19:33	00:19:38	it's gonna take a while to round up even the local ones.
168	00:19:40	00:19:41	Hey.
169	00:19:41	00:19:44	Hey. I just got off the phone with Brass.
170	00:19:44	00:19:47	We're not gonna find Herson by trapping his plastic.
171	00:19:47	00:19:50	According to his credit card company, he's been maxed out for months.
172	00:19:50	00:19:52	Great.
173	00:19:52	00:19:59	So, at this point, we seem to be dealing with a nice, retired machinist who suddenly goes on a killing spree because he's behind on his bills.
174	00:19:59	00:20:04	Well, one day, the wrong synapse fires, and a dam bursts.
175	00:20:04	00:20:08	No one can truly know what goes on inside another man's mind.
176	00:20:08	00:20:09	No.
177	00:20:19	00:20:21	Nick, come take a look at this.
178	00:20:29	00:20:32	I'm assuming that's not just another machine part.
179	00:20:32	00:20:33	It's a surgical tool.
180	00:20:33	00:20:36	According to the witness, it was a straight-up hit-and-run.
181	00:20:36	00:20:37	Started as a fender-bender.
182	00:20:37	00:20:40	One driver got out pissed; the pickup ran him over and split.
183	00:20:40	00:20:43	When the responding officer called in the tags, it came up as Herson.
184	00:20:43	00:20:46	Injured driver's in stable condition at Desert Palm.
185	00:20:46	00:20:48	Ah, he was lucky.
186	00:20:48	00:20:52	South Turkson at Blue Diamond three hours ago.
187	00:20:52	00:20:53	Where was Herson going?
188	00:20:56	00:21:01	These are pieces of a prototype stereotactic frame.
189	00:21:01	00:21:08	It's what a machinist makes in order to ensure his design works before he mills a real one.
190	00:21:08	00:21:10	Out of titanium, I'm guessing.
191	00:21:10	00:21:11	Yeah.
192	00:21:11	00:21:12	What's it for?
193	00:21:12	00:21:14	Neurosurgery.
194	00:21:14	00:21:26	The surgeon locks it onto the patient's skull, and then uses the calibration marks to precisely position instruments for operating on the brain.
195	00:21:28	00:21:31	You think Jack Herson is Dr. Jekyll.
196	00:21:31	00:21:35	Why would a methodical killer like Jekyll suddenly go ballistic and kill his next-door neighbor?
197	00:21:36	00:21:37	Maybe the Laymans saw something.
198	00:21:37	00:21:39	Figured out what Herson was doing down here.
199	00:21:39	00:21:42	Jekyll's killed a witness out of panic before.
200	00:21:45	00:21:51	To perform surgery, you... you need a operating table, don't you, Doctor?
201	00:22:16	00:22:18	That's a lot of blood.
202	00:22:21	00:22:24	All right. I'll see what I can find out.
203	00:22:24	00:22:26	Hey. Nick and Dr. Ray are finishing up at the Herson place.
204	00:22:27	00:22:28	I figured I might be able to help out here.
205	00:22:28	00:22:33	Highway Patrol just found Herson's car overheated and abandoned off the 160, outside of Pahrump.
206	00:22:33	00:22:35	Any idea who...
207	00:22:47	00:22:49	I take it you're playing a hunch?
208	00:22:49	00:22:50	Uh-huh.
209	00:22:50	00:22:54	What is the mascot for Pahrump Nye County High School?
210	00:22:54	00:22:56	Uh, the bulldog.
211	00:22:59	00:23:01	I thought so.
212	00:23:02	00:23:04	Herson knows a woman in West Pahrump.
213	00:23:04	00:23:07	The residence is number 28128...
214	00:23:07	00:23:08	I can't see the street.
215	00:23:08	00:23:12	Well, there can't be too many houses in that district with that number.
216	00:23:12	00:23:13	No, there can't.
217	00:23:21	00:23:26	Those men outside, they're going to hurt you if you don't do what they say.
218	00:23:26	00:23:28	You-you've always been a good boy, Jackie, and I...
219	00:23:28	00:23:32	I know that whatever you did, you-you must have had a reason.
220	00:23:32	00:23:35	Mr. Herson, we've got the place surrounded.
221	00:23:35	00:23:37	You know there's no way you can escape.
222	00:23:37	00:23:38	Why don't you pick up the phone and talk to us?
223	00:23:38	00:23:42	Stupid dog. I understand.
224	00:23:42	00:23:44	Stupid dog!
225	00:23:44	00:23:48	Sir, the house belongs to Nell Porter, a retired schoolteacher and Herson's aunt.
226	00:23:48	00:23:51	Yeah. There's something wrong with that guy.
227	00:23:51	00:23:52	Barking! Barking!
228	00:23:52	00:23:53	No kidding, sir. No, no.
229	00:23:53	00:23:55	I mean his behavior. Look at that.
230	00:23:55	00:23:57	He just kept barking and barking and barking.
231	00:24:02	00:24:04	Hold on a second.
232	00:24:04	00:24:06	What is it?
233	00:24:09	00:24:11	The radiator plug's missing. So?
234	00:24:11	00:24:14	So, if you turned on the heat, you'd flood the whole place.
235	00:24:16	00:24:19	Somewhat imprecise for a precision machinist.
236	00:24:19	00:24:21	Hang on to that.
237	00:24:24	00:24:25	Fresh tool marks.
238	00:24:25	00:24:27	This has been wrenched off recently.
239	00:24:30	00:24:31	Hang on a sec.
240	00:24:31	00:24:37	The last time Jekyll killed, he took a souvenir from the victim's house.
241	00:24:37	00:24:39	And he left...
242	00:24:39	00:24:41	Oh, please put the gun down!
243	00:24:41	00:24:45	Oh, please put the gun down, Jackie.
244	00:24:45	00:24:47	There's something wrong with my head.
245	00:24:58	00:24:59	Mr. Herson, please.
246	00:24:59	00:25:01	Why don't you let your aunt come on out?
247	00:25:04	00:25:05	We have a go.
248	00:25:06	00:25:08	(static crackles) Move! Move it!
249	00:25:10	00:25:13	Gita.
250	00:25:13	00:25:15	32.
251	00:25:18	00:25:19	Go! Let's go!
252	00:25:19	00:25:22	It's a passage from the Bhagavad Gita.
253	00:25:22	00:25:25	Let me see the hands. Get the hands up, sir!
254	00:25:25	00:25:31	The words that went through Robert Oppenheimer's mind after he witnessed the first atomic bomb test.
255	00:25:31	00:25:33	Stop moving now!
256	00:25:33	00:25:38	Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.
257	00:25:40	00:25:42	Herson isn't Jekyll.
258	00:25:42	00:25:44	No.
259	00:25:44	00:25:47	He's another victim.
260	00:26:10	00:26:23	Dr. Jekyll performed his first operation on an already dead street performer by inserting a laparoscope into the corpse and tying his intestines into a bow around his spleen.
261	00:26:23	00:26:31	However, his second victim was very much alive when Jekyll sewed a septic appendix to his ascending colon.
262	00:26:31	00:26:35	In both cases, Jekyll gave his victim something and then took a similar souvenir.
263	00:26:37	00:26:45	Joey Bigelow got a bow-tied intestine, and then Jekyll took his actual bow tie.
264	00:26:45	00:26:53	And Bernard Higgins received an extra appendix in exchange for a word from the appendix of his book.
265	00:26:53	00:26:58	And now it appears that Dr. Jekyll has taken Jack Herson's radiator plug.
266	00:26:58	00:27:01	Mm-hmm.
267	00:27:01	00:27:03	But in exchange for what?
268	00:27:07	00:27:09	What do you know?
269	00:27:09	00:27:11	Oh...
270	00:27:11	00:27:13	He's wearing a rug.
271	00:27:13	00:27:14	Oh.
272	00:27:14	00:27:20	Human hair hand-tied to a fine lace front to hide the hair line.
273	00:27:20	00:27:22	Quality carpet.
274	00:27:23	00:27:25	He's got stitches.
275	00:27:25	00:27:27	They look fresh.
276	00:27:27	00:27:29	They are.
277	00:27:32	00:27:34	What is that?
278	00:27:34	00:27:37	It's super-bright.
279	00:27:37	00:27:38	May be a bullet.
280	00:27:38	00:27:40	Give me another view.
281	00:27:43	00:27:44	I can't even see any edges.
282	00:27:44	00:27:47	And the image isn't moving at all.
283	00:27:51	00:27:53	Could it be radiating energy?
284	00:27:57	00:28:00	Radiator.
285	00:28:00	00:28:02	It's radioactive.
286	00:28:16	00:28:30	Looks like Dr. Jekyll drilled a hole in the top of Herson's skull, inserted a hollow needle between the brain hemispheres and into the septum pellucidum, and then shoved radioactive material in like peas through a straw.
287	00:28:31	00:28:33	They're radiation seeds.
288	00:28:33	00:28:37	Don't worry. It's a lead-infused acrylic.
289	00:28:37	00:28:38	Yeah, I've heard of these.
290	00:28:38	00:28:41	They're used to treat cancer.
291	00:28:41	00:28:43	Herson didn't have cancer. No.
292	00:28:43	00:28:49	The radiation severely damaged the area of the brain that's involved with mood changes, sexual gratification and rage.
293	00:28:49	00:28:53	In the 1950s, researchers induced similar lesions in rats.
294	00:28:53	00:29:00	It produced septal rage. These creatures would attack each other savagely with the slightest provocation.
295	00:29:00	00:29:03	Are we saying that Herson isn't responsible for his murders?
296	00:29:03	00:29:05	No. But he might not have been aware of what he was doing.
297	00:29:06	00:29:07	I'll bet he didn't even realize he'd been operated on.
298	00:29:07	00:29:11	Jekyll's anesthetic of choice is ketamine.
299	00:29:11	00:29:19	Herson would've come to with his rug back in place, disoriented, and unable to remember what happened.
300	00:29:35	00:29:39	According to his medical records, he called his HMO, complaining of severe headaches.
301	00:29:39	00:29:42	They said that they couldn't schedule an appointment until next week.
302	00:29:42	00:29:43	He threw a tantrum.
303	00:29:43	00:29:46	They said that he sounded drunk.
304	00:29:57	00:30:00	Maybe the dog barking was the final straw.
305	00:30:14	00:30:16	I'm sorry.
306	00:30:18	00:30:22	And not killing Gracie was the last shred of humanity he could muster.
307	00:30:22	00:30:26	Three weeks ago, Jack Herson made a cash deposit of $5,000.
308	00:30:26	00:30:34	The very next day, he drew up plans for the stereotactic unit and placed an order for medical-grade titanium.
309	00:30:34	00:30:40	So, Jekyll gives Herson the money to build the device, and then, when it's finished, he turns around and uses it on its maker?
310	00:30:41	00:30:43	I've seen my share of sickos, but this is severely twisted.
311	00:30:43	00:30:46	Dr. Jekyll is a classic sadist.
312	00:30:46	00:30:52	He designs his operations so his victims suffer slow, agonizing deaths.
313	00:30:52	00:30:55	Well, we have Herson's contacts and emails.
314	00:30:55	00:31:03	I know it's brute force, but if we can figure out where or how Herson and Jekyll could have crossed paths, it could lead us to him.
315	00:31:03	00:31:05	This is Jekyll's third time at bat.
316	00:31:05	00:31:07	He doesn't seem to be getting any sloppier.
317	00:31:09	00:31:12	Well, he did leave these.
318	00:31:32	00:31:37	Why did I just receive 17 pages of federal forms to fill out with your name on it?
319	00:31:37	00:31:42	Have you ever tried to locate 00 on a Friday in Las Vegas?
320	00:31:42	00:31:43	No.
321	00:31:44	00:31:54	I assumed you wanted the analysis as quickly as possible, and I'm happy to tell you that the implants showed gamma spikes characteristic of iridium 192.
322	00:31:54	00:31:57	Iridium 192?
323	00:31:57	00:31:59	That's used in high dose rate cancer therapy.
324	00:31:59	00:32:08	It also has half-life of 73.827 days, which means that a simple decay rate calculation can accurately determine when it was manufactured.
325	00:32:08	00:32:10	I take it you've performed this calculation?
326	00:32:10	00:32:11	Of course.
327	00:32:11	00:32:12	But there's more...
328	00:32:12	00:32:17	This gamma signature indicates that the pellet also contained gold.
329	00:32:17	00:32:29	The only commercially available iridium pellets with gold substrates are from Nosumi BioMed, which manufactured these seeds 13 days ago for delivery to Saint Sebastian's Hospital, in care of a Dr. William Burke.
330	00:32:29	00:32:31	I'll tell you what he says.
331	00:32:31	00:32:34	Well done, David Hodges.
332	00:32:36	00:32:42	And, uh, you can tell Homeland Security that the quantity of radioactive material in this is infinitesimal and poses no threat.
333	00:32:42	00:32:44	Oh, you can tell them.
334	00:32:44	00:32:46	Hang on a second. No.
335	00:32:46	00:32:50	If-if the radiation source is infinitesimal, why are you wearing three lead aprons?
336	00:32:50	00:32:53	Despite my aversion to children, sperm count.
337	00:33:01	00:33:05	Gentlemen, it, uh... seems you're correct.
338	00:33:05	00:33:08	We received 40 iridium seeds from the manufacturer last week.
339	00:33:08	00:33:14	My physicist just counted them in the storage room, and...
340	00:33:14	00:33:16	we are ten short.
341	00:33:16	00:33:23	Do you know what happened to them? Not yet, but I promise you we will. It's possible it's a clerical error. It's also possible someone stole them.
342	00:33:24	00:33:25	What for?
343	00:33:25	00:33:29	You can't make a dirty bomb out of them, and they won't get you high.
344	00:33:30	00:33:32	Have we met?
345	00:33:32	00:33:35	No, I don't believe we have.
346	00:33:35	00:33:43	Why are a homicide detective and a CSI investigating a discrepancy in our inventory?
347	00:33:43	00:33:45	Your iridium seeds were used by a killer.
348	00:33:45	00:33:48	A person with sophisticated surgical skills.
349	00:33:48	00:33:50	Sounds like a modern-day Jack the Ripper.
350	00:33:50	00:33:52	The perpetrator's not a simple cutter.
351	00:33:52	00:33:59	Two days ago, he used a custom-built stereotactic device to insert your pellets into a man's septum.
352	00:33:59	00:34:04	The ensuing brain damage caused the victim to kill three people before he died himself.
353	00:34:04	00:34:05	You're kidding.
354	00:34:05	00:34:06	No, I'm not.
355	00:34:06	00:34:12	Dr. Burke, we're gonna need a detailed account of your whereabouts in the last several days.
356	00:34:13	00:34:14	Mostly here.
357	00:34:18	00:34:20	Am I a suspect?
358	00:34:20	00:34:21	We're just following our leads, Doc.
359	00:34:21	00:34:23	Actually, we're trying to rule you out.
360	00:34:23	00:34:25	Right.
361	00:34:25	00:34:28	My secretary can give you that information.
362	00:34:28	00:34:31	If you'll excuse me, I have a patient with prostate cancer.
363	00:34:31	00:34:35	I have to tell him that his surgery has been delayed.
364	00:34:39	00:34:41	I got it.
365	00:34:41	00:34:46	Raymond Langston-- you wrote that book about the Angel of Death at Delaware General.
366	00:34:46	00:34:47	Oh, yeah!
367	00:34:47	00:34:49	You'd love it if I was the killer.
368	00:34:50	00:34:57	Then you could write a sequel about another psychopathic doctor murdering his patients, and use it as an excuse to indict the entire medical establishment again.
369	00:34:57	00:35:00	Well, obviously, you didn't read very clearly or carefully.
370	00:35:00	00:35:02	I was examining my own failures in the book.
371	00:35:02	00:35:07	Interesting how your soul-searching managed to imply that everyone else was incompetent.
372	00:35:07	00:35:11	You took one rogue surgeon and vilified an entire profession.
373	00:35:11	00:35:13	I saw their mistakes in the morgue, Doctor.
374	00:35:13	00:35:15	I wrote what I saw.
375	00:35:15	00:35:18	I don't suffer the illusion that all surgeons walk on water.
376	00:35:18	00:35:21	You know, Ray, I think were not needed here.
377	00:35:21	00:35:23	I think we're all done.
378	00:35:23	00:35:25	Thanks for your time, Doctor. Mm-hmm.
379	00:35:25	00:35:26	Let's go.
380	00:35:26	00:35:27	Uh, you sound a little envious.
381	00:35:27	00:35:28	Why is that?
382	00:35:28	00:35:34	Because you didn't have what it takes to cut into a living, breathing human being and try and save their lives?
383	00:35:34	00:35:35	Being a pathologist is easier.
384	00:35:35	00:35:36	Your patients are already dead.
385	00:35:36	00:35:40	It's kind of like being a CSI, I guess, right?
386	00:35:40	00:35:41	You're perfect for the job.
387	00:35:42	00:35:43	(loud bang) Aah!
388	00:35:45	00:35:47	Now you've got a problem.
389	00:36:05	00:36:10	So, the good doctor saw the light, and he's agreed not to press charges for assault.
390	00:36:10	00:36:20	I convinced him that a very public investigation into how he lost potentially dangerous radioactive material may impact negatively on his insurance liability, both for him and his hospital.
391	00:36:20	00:36:22	So he calmed down and...
392	00:36:22	00:36:25	actually became kind of reasonable.
393	00:36:25	00:36:28	So I said we'll chalk it up to an accident.
394	00:36:28	00:36:31	It was an accident, right?
395	00:36:33	00:36:40	Yeah. Look, Ray, I mean, I've known you long enough to know that you don't like to get any advice, but I'm gonna give you some anyway, okay?
396	00:36:40	00:36:47	You know, if this song-and-dance here that you did was because you're frustrated about the Jekyll killer, I understand that. I get it.
397	00:36:47	00:36:49	But if it has to do with something...
398	00:36:49	00:36:55	from the past, some old, unfinished business, something from way back when...
399	00:36:55	00:37:01	I suggest you drop it, 'cause it's not working for you.
400	00:37:02	00:37:05	That's all I'm gonna say.
401	00:37:13	00:37:17	All of the restricted areas in the hospital have keypad locks.
402	00:37:17	00:37:21	To gain access, I assume all your people have to enter their personal code. Exactly.
403	00:37:21	00:37:24	Our system tracks every time and place one of those codes is used.
404	00:37:24	00:37:28	Now, these surveillance photos were taken at the door to the nuclear medicine storage room.
405	00:37:28	00:37:30	That's where we keep those radioactive seeds.
406	00:37:30	00:37:36	Mm-hmm. And these are the people who entered during the time period the seeds went missing?
407	00:37:36	00:37:38	Mm-hmm.
408	00:37:40	00:37:42	Hmm.
409	00:37:42	00:37:43	Huh, what is it?
410	00:37:43	00:37:50	This man used Dr. Davis is a five-foot-two African-American woman, and she's in Hawaii.
411	00:37:50	00:37:54	Has that code been used anywhere else in the hospital since then?
412	00:37:54	00:37:55	Uh, searching.
413	00:37:58	00:38:00	It was used four minutes ago.
414	00:38:00	00:38:05	Where? A surgical supply locker on the fifth floor.
415	00:38:05	00:38:06	Get on the phone, lock down the building. Lock it down!
416	00:38:06	00:38:08	Hey, what's going on?
417	00:38:08	00:38:09	Dr. Jekyll's here-- fifth floor.
418	00:38:09	00:38:11	Control, this is Charlie 03 Stokes.
419	00:38:11	00:38:13	I need four units containment, Saint Sebastian Hospital.
420	00:38:13	00:38:14	You sure he's in the building?
421	00:38:14	00:38:17	Yeah, he was in a lab coat and a surgical mask.
422	00:38:17	00:38:19	So are half of the people in here.
423	00:38:24	00:38:26	You go east; I'll go west.
424	00:38:26	00:38:28	Yeah.
425	00:38:51	00:38:52	Excuse me.
426	00:38:52	00:38:54	Everyone, I'm a crime scene investigator with the Vegas PD.
427	00:38:54	00:38:57	I need everyone to remove their masks for me, please.
428	00:38:57	00:38:59	Are you out of your mind? This is a sterile area!
429	00:38:59	00:39:00	And I'm in pursuit of a murder suspect.
430	00:39:00	00:39:02	Take it off.
431	00:39:02	00:39:05	Take if off! That goes for the rest of you, too. Get them off.
432	00:39:05	00:39:06	Identify each other.
433	00:39:06	00:39:08	We're all here.
434	00:39:08	00:39:10	There's nobody that shouldn't be.
435	00:39:41	00:39:43	What the hell is your problem?
436	00:39:50	00:39:51	Hey, straight ahead.
437	00:39:54	00:39:55	Marcie, call security!
438	00:39:56	00:39:58	Hold it right there!
439	00:39:58	00:40:00	Hold it right there! I'm a CSI.
440	00:41:21	00:41:24	Did you see a doctor come through here?
441	00:41:24	00:41:26	Anyone?
442	00:41:26	00:41:27	A doctor?
443	00:41:27	00:41:29	A man dressed...
444	00:41:29	00:41:31	as a doctor?
445	00:41:32	00:41:36	A man in a white coat with a doctor's mask come through here?
446	00:41:36	00:41:38	A man dressed like a doctor!
447	00:41:38	00:41:40	Has he come through? Which way did he go?
448	00:41:40	00:41:42	Nick, Jekyll just went through the kitchen.
449	00:41:42	00:41:44	I'm on my way.
450	00:42:02	00:42:04	Where's the kitchen?
451	00:42:04	00:42:05	Back there.
