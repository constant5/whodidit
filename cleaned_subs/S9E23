3,00:00:36,00:00:38,(cackles)
4,00:00:41,00:00:43,Ready for a good night?
5,00:00:43,00:00:44,"You know I am, baby."
6,00:00:47,00:00:49,(rock music playing)
7,00:00:51,00:00:54,"Watch out, fellas. Watch out."
8,00:00:54,00:00:55,"Hey, Rudy!"
9,00:00:55,00:00:57,"How's it going, brother?"
10,00:00:57,00:00:59,Hook us up with two.
11,00:01:00,00:01:01,"Here you go, Joey."
12,00:01:06,00:01:08,"Yo, Death! You wanna shoot?"
13,00:01:08,00:01:10,I'm broke.
14,00:01:10,00:01:12,"I'll spot you, brother."
15,00:01:12,00:01:13,"Ha-ha, brother!"
16,00:01:14,00:01:15,Huh!
17,00:01:15,00:01:19,(indistinct conversations)
18,00:01:20,00:01:24,"Joey, check it out."
19,00:01:24,00:01:26,Talk about easy rider.
20,00:01:26,00:01:30,"Hey, you got a ride like this, man, you got to stay on it."
21,00:01:36,00:01:38,(man chuckling)
22,00:01:40,00:01:42,"I'm going to kick your ass, Hooper!"
23,00:01:43,00:01:44,(grunting and groaning)
24,00:01:44,00:01:46,"(clanging, glass shattering)"
25,00:01:46,00:01:47,(laughing)
26,00:01:47,00:01:49,It's all family love here.
27,00:01:51,00:01:53,"Come on, Jackass, Get in there!"
28,00:01:56,00:01:59,(grunting and groaning)
29,00:02:03,00:02:05,(sirens blaring)
30,00:02:05,00:02:08,(clamoring) (engines revving)

32,00:02:13,00:02:17,(weapons locking and loading)
33,00:02:17,00:02:20,(officers shouting commands)
34,00:02:21,00:02:22,(tires squeal)
35,00:02:24,00:02:27,OFFICER: Let me see your hands! Up!
36,00:02:27,00:02:29,"Let's go, keep it moving."
37,00:02:30,00:02:32,"BRASS: So, a radio car was in the neighborhood."
38,00:02:32,00:02:34,Picked up a 911 call from dispatch.
39,00:02:34,00:02:37,A 911 call for a biker bar fight?
40,00:02:37,00:02:38,(chuckles) Did you run the number?
41,00:02:38,00:02:40,Untraceable cell.
42,00:02:40,00:02:41,"MAN: Yo, pig!"
43,00:02:41,00:02:43,Don't you touch my hog!
44,00:02:47,00:02:48,Close the door.
45,00:02:52,00:02:53,"LANGSTON: What do we have, David?"
46,00:02:53,00:02:55,Liver stick's 98.
47,00:02:55,00:02:56,No rigor.
48,00:02:56,00:02:57,Lividity isn't fixed.
49,00:02:57,00:02:59,They don't get much fresher.
50,00:02:59,00:03:01,(camera shutter clicking)
51,00:03:03,00:03:06,"""Vegas Blasters."" BRASS: He's flying his colors."
52,00:03:07,00:03:09,That means he's a sworn member of the gang.
53,00:03:09,00:03:11,"David, would you turn him over for me, please?"
54,00:03:11,00:03:13,Sure thing.
55,00:03:19,00:03:20,Whoa.
56,00:03:20,00:03:22,Multiple knife wounds.
57,00:03:22,00:03:25,Takes a serious blade to cut through leather like that.
58,00:03:25,00:03:26,(groaning)
59,00:03:27,00:03:30,The knife's sheath on his belt's empty.
60,00:03:30,00:03:32,He was probably trying to defend himself.
61,00:03:33,00:03:34,Do we know who he is?
62,00:03:34,00:03:37,"No wallet, no ID, and apparently, there were no eyewitnesses."
63,00:03:38,00:03:40,We have a packed club.
64,00:03:40,00:03:42,Nobody knows what happened?
65,00:03:42,00:03:45,When nobody knows nothing...
66,00:03:45,00:03:47,somebody knows something.
67,00:04:27,00:04:29,This is my first time in a biker bar.
68,00:04:29,00:04:30,(sniffs)
69,00:04:30,00:04:31,"Mmm, what's that scent?"
70,00:04:31,00:04:35,"Beer, urine, sweat, vomit..."
71,00:04:36,00:04:37,And death.
72,00:04:37,00:04:43,A lot of people think these guys just run holiday toy drives and host rallies for kids with cancer.
73,00:04:43,00:04:46,"In a magic act, that would be called a misdirection."
74,00:04:46,00:04:48,I'd call this a slaughter.
75,00:04:48,00:04:50,"All this blood, one victim?"
76,00:04:50,00:05:06,"I'm thinking it started back there by the second pool table, moved up through this blood pool, where I found the chain, and ended about here, where we found the body."
77,00:05:06,00:05:08,I still can't make any sense of all these bloody footprints.
78,00:05:08,00:05:12,SANDERS: We'll compare them to the shoes of our guys in custody.
79,00:05:12,00:05:14,"Meanwhile, I'll start collecting blood samples."
80,00:05:15,00:05:20,"The police arrived minutes after the 911 call, so the weapon or weapons may still be here."
81,00:05:20,00:05:21,I'll check the kitchen.
82,00:05:21,00:05:22,Good place to ditch a knife.
83,00:05:22,00:05:24,(sighs)
84,00:05:24,00:05:29,I want to go take a look at the bikes before they go to impound.
85,00:05:30,00:05:33,"Longhorns, nice."
86,00:05:36,00:05:38,Beautiful.
87,00:05:38,00:05:41,Beautiful machines.
88,00:05:41,00:05:42,"Okay, thank you."
89,00:05:42,00:05:45,First time I've ever coveted physical evidence.
90,00:05:45,00:05:52,"Well, I ran the plates on all of them, and they all came back matched to the people we have in custody, except for this one here. The victim's bike?"
91,00:05:52,00:05:53,Possibly.
92,00:05:53,00:05:55,R.O.'s come back a Joseph Niagra.
93,00:05:55,00:05:56,Do we have a home address?
94,00:05:56,00:05:58,You're standing in front of it.
95,00:05:58,00:06:00,But I'll run him through the system.
96,00:06:00,00:06:01,All these guys have records.
97,00:06:01,00:06:03,"I tell these kids, ""You want to join a gang?"
98,00:06:03,00:06:04,"""You should join us."
99,00:06:04,00:06:07,"""We're more powerful. We got bigger guns..."
100,00:06:07,00:06:11,"and we got dental."" Sold me."
101,00:06:44,00:06:46,Hmm.
102,00:06:46,00:06:47,How's it going here?
103,00:06:47,00:06:51,"Well, every single one of these knives tested positive for blood."
104,00:06:51,00:06:54,"These are animal, and these are human."
105,00:06:54,00:06:56,SANDERS: You should get these back to the lab.
106,00:06:56,00:06:58,They need you at PD.
107,00:06:58,00:07:00,(water running)
108,00:07:03,00:07:05,"Oh, Tonya."
109,00:07:05,00:07:08,You should have listened to your mother.
110,00:07:08,00:07:10,(camera shutter clicking)
111,00:07:12,00:07:15,"When I was in high school, there was this guy, Mark."
112,00:07:15,00:07:17,He had a motorcycle.
113,00:07:17,00:07:18,(camera shutter clicking) Let me guess.
114,00:07:18,00:07:24,"Your mom told you to stay away from him, but you were Romeo and Juliet, riding around on 600 pounds of steel."
115,00:07:25,00:07:26,"Oh, we had fun."
116,00:07:26,00:07:28,(chuckles)
117,00:07:28,00:07:29,But I moved on.
118,00:07:29,00:07:36,"In fact, I didn't give bikers another thought until, years later, I'm in the ER with a hit-and-run victim."
119,00:07:36,00:07:38,Guy on a bike.
120,00:07:38,00:07:41,Just a piece of meat in search of a pulse.
121,00:07:43,00:07:47,"The entire time I'm processing him, I never realized it was my Romeo."
122,00:07:47,00:07:49,He was that beat up.
123,00:07:49,00:07:53,Final stab wound tally: 24.
124,00:07:53,00:07:56,"Multiple abrasions, hematomas."
125,00:07:58,00:07:59,This one's got a looping pattern.
126,00:07:59,00:08:02,Ray said that he found a chain at the scene.
127,00:08:10,00:08:12,It's a good way of slowing somebody down.
128,00:08:12,00:08:15,Maybe he needed slowing down.
129,00:08:18,00:08:19,Take a look at the teeth.
130,00:08:19,00:08:21,This is your mouth on meth.
131,00:08:21,00:08:23,(beeping)
132,00:08:23,00:08:25,Joseph Niagra.
133,00:08:25,00:08:28,Same as the R.O. on the unclaimed bike.
134,00:08:31,00:08:34,(murmuring)
135,00:08:38,00:08:39,HODGES: Right hand.
136,00:08:48,00:08:51,(indistinct voices)
137,00:08:53,00:08:55,"WOMAN: Turn around, please."
138,00:08:55,00:08:57,Thank you.
139,00:08:58,00:09:01,"MAN: Yeah, yeah, I heard you, I heard you."
140,00:09:03,00:09:06,"Okay, would you please open your mouth, Mister..."
141,00:09:06,00:09:08,Jackass. MITCHELL: Shut up.
142,00:09:08,00:09:09,Get off me!
143,00:09:10,00:09:13,It's my name. Okay.
144,00:09:13,00:09:16,"Would you please open your mouth, Mr. Jackass?"
145,00:09:19,00:09:21,WOMAN: Next in line?
146,00:09:21,00:09:23,Thank you.
147,00:09:26,00:09:28,Right hand.
148,00:09:38,00:09:40,(sighs)
149,00:09:41,00:09:44,WEBSTER: There's so much grease on these paws.
150,00:09:44,00:09:45,I can't get a clean print.
151,00:09:45,00:09:47,MAN: I work in a body shop.
152,00:09:47,00:09:48,What do you expect?
153,00:10:03,00:10:05,Excuse me.
154,00:10:05,00:10:07,"All right, you know what? Could you just...?"
155,00:10:07,00:10:08,"Okay, here."
156,00:10:08,00:10:10,Could you maybe just...
157,00:10:12,00:10:15,"Okay, Badger, what happened last night?"
158,00:10:17,00:10:20,Did Joey Niagra do something to piss you off?
159,00:10:22,00:10:26,"What is this, the biker code of silence?"
160,00:10:28,00:10:31,You're the only member of the gang who wasn't carrying a weapon.
161,00:10:32,00:10:33,They're not a gang.
162,00:10:35,00:10:37,They're just a bunch of guys that like to ride together.
163,00:10:37,00:10:41,But you're the only bartender in South Vegas who doesn't carry protection.
164,00:10:41,00:10:44,(chuckles softly) Man...
165,00:10:44,00:10:47,you got to start looking for a better class of bar.
166,00:10:47,00:10:49,You're going to be looking throughbars for a long time.
167,00:10:49,00:10:51,Get him out of here.
168,00:11:03,00:11:05,And now your boots.
169,00:11:08,00:11:13,"When you're done with fingerprinting, the officer will take you to another room where he'll collect the rest of your clothing."
170,00:11:16,00:11:17,I ain't stripping.
171,00:11:17,00:11:22,"I promise you, jail scrubs are much cleaner and more flattering than the blood-and-grease-soaked homicide evidence that you're currently wearing."
172,00:11:22,00:11:24,"Let's go, Jackass."
173,00:11:25,00:11:26,SIMMS: Tonya Charles?
174,00:11:26,00:11:28,"Would you open your mouth, please?"
175,00:11:28,00:11:29,"Stick it in your own mouth, bitch."
176,00:11:29,00:11:31,Hey! Hey!
177,00:11:31,00:11:32,You're out of line.
178,00:11:32,00:11:35,"Bite my out-of-line ass. You owe Ms. Simms an apology. No, Hodges, it's okay."
179,00:11:35,00:11:38,"No, apologize."
180,00:11:38,00:11:39,"(Hodges groans, spectators laughing)"
181,00:11:39,00:11:40,Uh-oh.
182,00:11:40,00:11:42,TONYA: Get your hands off me! OFFICER: Settle down!
183,00:11:42,00:11:43,"WOMAN: Yeah, girl!"
184,00:11:43,00:11:45,That was stupid. (handcuffs click)
185,00:11:45,00:11:47,"Ugh, chivalry is not dead."
186,00:11:47,00:11:50,"No, but its nose is bleeding."
187,00:11:50,00:11:51,(grunting)
188,00:11:51,00:11:53,Hold on a second.
189,00:11:53,00:11:54,(panting)
190,00:11:54,00:11:57,"""Property of Joey."" Is it Joey Niagra?"
191,00:12:18,00:12:20,The victim's bike?
192,00:12:20,00:12:21,Yes.
193,00:12:21,00:12:24,Lots of greasy prints.
194,00:12:25,00:12:27,"Look, I found this iPod."
195,00:12:28,00:12:33,It's got an AM-FM receiver and a very interesting playlist.
196,00:12:33,00:12:34,What do you got for me?
197,00:12:34,00:12:37,Joey Niagra popped up in CODIS.
198,00:12:38,00:12:41,He was connected to an open homicide: dead hooker.
199,00:12:41,00:12:43,I guess he was her last trick.
200,00:12:43,00:12:44,Definitely.
201,00:12:44,00:12:46,Sex was postmortem.
202,00:12:46,00:12:49,"Some kind of initiation rite, no doubt."
203,00:12:49,00:12:53,Kill the hooker; have sex with the body; get your colors on your bike.
204,00:12:53,00:12:55,I'm almost done processing here.
205,00:13:01,00:13:02,What is that?
206,00:13:12,00:13:13,Huh.
207,00:13:15,00:13:16,Well...
208,00:13:16,00:13:20,"""J.N."" Joey's missing knife."
209,00:13:20,00:13:21,He didn't put it there.
210,00:13:21,00:13:23,It's been wiped clean.
211,00:13:23,00:13:25,Someone's trying to send us a message.
212,00:13:25,00:13:26,Yeah.
213,00:13:26,00:13:31,"""Shove it."" ECKLIE: Jim."
214,00:13:31,00:13:33,"Yeah, what's up?"
215,00:13:33,00:13:36,Got an alert from Records Bureau you ran prints on Joey Niagra.
216,00:13:36,00:13:37,An alert?
217,00:13:37,00:13:38,Yeah.
218,00:13:38,00:13:41,His real name's Jack Nettles.
219,00:13:41,00:13:45,Vice recruited him two years ago from Indianapolis for an undercover job.
220,00:13:45,00:13:47,So what's going on?
221,00:13:47,00:13:49,The Vegas Blasters homicide.
222,00:13:49,00:13:50,He's the victim.
223,00:13:50,00:13:54,What kind of cop is a tweaking necrophiliac?
224,00:13:58,00:14:02,"It's tough giving this kind of news to the wife of a victim. Yeah, well, I'll try to spare her too many details."
225,00:14:02,00:14:04,Well...
226,00:14:14,00:14:15,Rita.
227,00:14:15,00:14:16,What are you...?
228,00:14:19,00:14:25,"Mrs. Nettles, I'm Conrad Ecklie, Las Vegas Undersheriff."
229,00:14:25,00:14:27,"Oh, uh, please come in."
230,00:14:37,00:14:43,"I'm sorry to have to inform you that, uh, your husband..."
231,00:14:43,00:14:44,(sobbing): No.
232,00:14:44,00:14:46,"Oh, God."
233,00:14:48,00:14:51,"Oh, my God!"
234,00:14:51,00:14:55,"Oh, my God, no!"
235,00:14:57,00:15:01,Your husband was killed during an undercover operation.
236,00:15:01,00:15:04,Captain Brass is in charge of the murder investigation.
237,00:15:04,00:15:06,(sniffles)
238,00:15:06,00:15:09,"I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am."
239,00:15:09,00:15:11,My loss?
240,00:15:13,00:15:15,This...
241,00:15:18,00:15:20,This iswhoI lost...
242,00:15:22,00:15:28,...over six months ago when he turned into someone I didn't recognize anymore.
243,00:15:31,00:15:33,"Jim, when did it happen?"
244,00:15:33,00:15:34,Last night.
245,00:15:34,00:15:37,It happened last night.
246,00:15:38,00:15:42,I tried to see his captain last night.
247,00:15:42,00:15:43,He's got to help me.
248,00:15:43,00:15:45,He's got to get my husband out of that gang.
249,00:15:45,00:15:47,"Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I need his help."
250,00:15:48,00:15:50,Captain Collins is not available.
251,00:15:50,00:15:51,Wha...? Take a seat.
252,00:15:51,00:15:54,You've had a few too many.
253,00:15:54,00:15:55,I'll have an officer drive you home. (groans)
254,00:15:55,00:15:57,Okay?
255,00:15:57,00:16:00,I'm sorry. I have to... I...
256,00:16:00,00:16:02,(sobbing)
257,00:16:08,00:16:11,You going to tell me how you know her?
258,00:16:12,00:16:14,No.
259,00:16:33,00:16:36,"SANDERS: According to DNA, none of this blood over here is the vic's."
260,00:16:36,00:16:41,This is from the biker named Hooper and this...
261,00:16:41,00:16:44,is from Jackass.
262,00:16:45,00:16:49,This could be from a fight unrelated to the murder.
263,00:16:49,00:16:54,"Okay, well, I'm all set up here, so let's try to confirm that those prints are from our victim."
264,00:17:05,00:17:07,(beeping)
265,00:17:27,00:17:28,(groaning)
266,00:17:31,00:17:37,"It looks like he was trying to get away, but we still don't know who tried to kill him."
267,00:17:37,00:17:40,Or how they found out he was a cop.
268,00:17:40,00:17:41,TONYA: Back off.
269,00:17:41,00:17:46,See if you like being strip-searched as much as you like shooting off your mouth.
270,00:17:51,00:17:52,"Good work, Willows."
271,00:17:52,00:17:53,Ever work undercover?
272,00:17:53,00:17:55,We can always use another tough bitch.
273,00:17:55,00:17:57,Okay.
274,00:17:57,00:18:02,"So with you on the inside, when they threw women at Nettles, he could always say that he didn't cheat on his old lady, right?"
275,00:18:02,00:18:04,Except for dead hookers. Right?
276,00:18:04,00:18:07,Joey-- Jack-- had to do that.
277,00:18:07,00:18:09,Had to be trusted enough to become a member.
278,00:18:09,00:18:11,"Well, obviously something happened to that trust."
279,00:18:11,00:18:16,Jack was trying to learn who the guy at the top is-- the guy calling the shots in the drug racket and the murders for hire.
280,00:18:16,00:18:19,Only a couple in the inner circle know his real identity.
281,00:18:19,00:18:21,They don't use his real name. He goes by Scratch. Scratch...
282,00:18:21,00:18:24,"All right, so what happened last night?"
283,00:18:24,00:18:26,We-We're in the clubhouse after an all-day ride.
284,00:18:27,00:18:29,"C-Couple of fights, nothing unusual."
285,00:18:29,00:18:31,Then the bartender takes a phone call.
286,00:18:31,00:18:32,"(snapping fingers): Like that, atmosphere changes."
287,00:18:32,00:18:33,It's real tense.
288,00:18:36,00:18:39,(whistles)
289,00:18:40,00:18:42,My guess: it's Scratch calling.
290,00:18:42,00:18:48,"Then, one of the ""hangers""-- guy who's not a member yet-- he takes all the old ladies and the rest of the hangers and he takes us all outside."
291,00:18:49,00:18:52,Members only. Outside.
292,00:18:54,00:18:55,What time?
293,00:18:55,00:18:58,"About 10:00, minute or two after."
294,00:18:58,00:19:00,I'm cold. I got to pee.
295,00:19:00,00:19:01,Find a bush.
296,00:19:05,00:19:06,(man groaning)
297,00:19:12,00:19:14,(gasping)
298,00:19:18,00:19:24,"They just killed a guy inside the Blasters' clubhouse-- Rancho Destino, south of Barston."
299,00:19:24,00:19:26,Hurry... hurry.
300,00:19:28,00:19:30,What are you looking at?
301,00:19:32,00:19:34,Anybody see you make that call?
302,00:19:34,00:19:35,I don't think so.
303,00:19:36,00:19:40,"According to Vice, Nettles' last report said there's a truckload of cocaine coming in from Mexico."
304,00:19:40,00:19:43,"Yeah, only the West Side bike gang Righteous Dogs got wind of it."
305,00:19:43,00:19:44,It's going to be a war.
306,00:19:44,00:19:49,Do you know where and when this shipment is gonna take place? Yeah-- no-- I-I'll find out.
307,00:19:49,00:19:51,"No, you won't, 'cause Ecklie took you off the detail."
308,00:19:51,00:19:53,What?!
309,00:19:53,00:19:54,No!
310,00:19:54,00:19:55,No.
311,00:19:55,00:19:56,"No way in hell, man!"
312,00:19:56,00:19:58,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey."
313,00:19:58,00:19:59,Hey!
314,00:19:59,00:20:00,What are you on?
315,00:20:00,00:20:02,What do you think?
316,00:20:02,00:20:04,You picked me up partying with bikers.
317,00:20:04,00:20:05,Calm down. Calm down.
318,00:20:05,00:20:07,What do you want me to do?
319,00:20:07,00:20:13,I want you to get Ecklie in here so I can tell him I ain't quitting.
320,00:20:13,00:20:15,I'm not letting Jack die in vain.
321,00:20:17,00:20:20,C.O.D. was exsanguination.
322,00:20:20,00:20:28,Found significant amount of internal hemorrhage to the lung and pleural cavity from stabs to the liver and mesentery.
323,00:20:28,00:20:31,So he was alive and his heart was beating the entire time?
324,00:20:31,00:20:33,Untilitwas lacerated.
325,00:20:33,00:20:35,"It's one of the final injuries, along with this one."
326,00:20:37,00:20:42,"Stab wound to the left temple about, oh... two inches deep."
327,00:20:45,00:20:48,Quite a lot of stab marks.
328,00:20:48,00:20:51,We need to compare these with the weapons we've collected.
329,00:20:51,00:20:53,I'll cut them all out and send them upstairs.
330,00:20:53,00:20:54,23 stab wounds.
331,00:20:54,00:20:55,Twenty-four.
332,00:20:55,00:20:57,I was thinking of Julius Caesar.
333,00:20:57,00:21:01,Ah... history's first recorded autopsy.
334,00:21:01,00:21:04,"Doctor named Antistius did the honors, if I recall."
335,00:21:04,00:21:09,On the body of a man betrayed by those he knew well.
336,00:22:31,00:22:35,SIMMS: The blood on the knife that you found in the motorcycle seat was the victim's.
337,00:22:35,00:22:40,STOKES: And I was able to match that knife to two of his wounds: the stab to the sternum and the left temple.
338,00:22:40,00:22:41,What about the other knives?
339,00:22:41,00:22:48,"Double-edged, serrated, smooth blade-- none of which was a match to the tool marks on the body."
340,00:22:48,00:22:51,SIMMS: And none of the blood on those knives came back to the victim.
341,00:22:51,00:22:54,But I did get two CODIS hits from the knives that Hodges collected.
342,00:22:54,00:23:01,"These guys were both members of the Righteous Dogs, and their body parts were found scattered across two miles of the Mojave."
343,00:23:01,00:23:03,Probably carved them up in the kitchen.
344,00:23:04,00:23:05,The Blasters and the Dogs are rival gangs.
345,00:23:06,00:23:09,There's been a war over drug turf escalating over the last year.
346,00:23:10,00:23:14,We still only have one of the knives used to kill Nettles.
347,00:23:14,00:23:15,There had to be others.
348,00:23:15,00:23:20,"All right, the police arrived one minute, just one minute, after the 911 call."
349,00:23:20,00:23:23,Those other knives couldn't have gone very far.
350,00:23:23,00:23:27,"No. I appreciate that, Conrad, I do, but there's no need for me to recuse myself, really."
351,00:23:27,00:23:29,No.
352,00:23:29,00:23:31,"If the situation changes, yeah, I'll, uh, I'll let you know."
353,00:23:31,00:23:33,Okay?
354,00:23:33,00:23:34,(tapping on window)
355,00:23:34,00:23:36,I got to go. Thank you.
356,00:23:41,00:23:44,Rita. Hi.
357,00:23:44,00:23:46,Hi.
358,00:23:46,00:23:47,Can I come in?
359,00:23:47,00:23:49,"Oh, sure, sure. I hope this is okay."
360,00:23:49,00:23:50,No. It's fine.
361,00:23:50,00:23:53,"Uh, they asked me to come down about some paperwork. Sure."
362,00:23:53,00:23:54,Come on in. I hope this is okay.
363,00:23:54,00:23:56,"Come in. Please, come in."
364,00:23:56,00:23:57,Sit down.
365,00:23:57,00:23:59,"Sit down. Please, sit down."
366,00:23:59,00:24:00,(clears throat)
367,00:24:00,00:24:02,(sniffles) Can I get you anything?
368,00:24:02,00:24:03,Do you want anything at all?
369,00:24:03,00:24:06,Oh. A shoulder?
370,00:24:06,00:24:07,"Oh, Rita. No. I know. I know."
371,00:24:07,00:24:09,This isn't the place for that. I'm sorry. I just...
372,00:24:09,00:24:11,That's not it. That's not it. That's not it.
373,00:24:11,00:24:15,Why didn't you ever tell me that you were a cop?
374,00:24:15,00:24:17,What? I didn't? I-I thought...
375,00:24:19,00:24:20,"No, I guess not. I..."
376,00:24:20,00:24:23,I told you that I was married.
377,00:24:24,00:24:25,"Uh, kind of."
378,00:24:25,00:24:27,"Let's not, um..."
379,00:24:27,00:24:29,We don't really have to talk about that now.
380,00:24:29,00:24:30,"That's not important, all right?"
381,00:24:30,00:24:31,Look... We've been over that.
382,00:24:31,00:24:34,"No, I want... I want to ex..."
383,00:24:34,00:24:35,explain to you. I...
384,00:24:35,00:24:37,You don't have to explain anything to me.
385,00:24:37,00:24:44,"I was calling his captain every day because weeks are going by, and I'm not hearing from Jack."
386,00:24:44,00:24:47,I woke up once in the middle of the night.
387,00:24:47,00:24:51,"He had snuck in, and he was stealing some money out of my purse."
388,00:24:53,00:24:55,He was on drugs or something.
389,00:24:55,00:24:57,I don't know.
390,00:24:57,00:25:00,He started hitting me.
391,00:25:00,00:25:07,"And I was... I was pulling on his shirt, trying to get him to stop it, and I..."
392,00:25:09,00:25:11,I see the name Tonya... Yeah.
393,00:25:11,00:25:13,"...tattooed on his chest, and..."
394,00:25:13,00:25:19,How could he ever be my husband again after he'd had another woman's name burned into his skin like that? I...
395,00:25:20,00:25:21,Rita...
396,00:25:21,00:25:23,I didn't tell you the truth...
397,00:25:25,00:25:27,...because I was afraid.
398,00:25:27,00:25:29,I'm sorry.
399,00:25:29,00:25:31,"Because I, uh... I handled it badly."
400,00:25:32,00:25:33,I was not very graceful about... (knocking)
401,00:25:33,00:25:35,(clears throat)
402,00:25:35,00:25:37,Jim? I'm sorry. Excuse me.
403,00:25:37,00:25:38,Yeah. No. What? What's up?
404,00:25:39,00:25:41,Said you wanted to know when Tonya Charles is released.
405,00:25:41,00:25:42,Right.
406,00:25:58,00:26:00,Rita?
407,00:26:00,00:26:02,Yeah?
408,00:26:02,00:26:07,We are doing everything we can to find the killer of your husband.
409,00:26:17,00:26:19,(motorcycle engine purring)
410,00:26:23,00:26:25,(engine revving)
411,00:26:29,00:26:30,(brakes squeak)
412,00:26:30,00:26:32,You lost?
413,00:26:33,00:26:34,I don't think so. (chuckles)
414,00:26:35,00:26:36,Where's your car?
415,00:26:36,00:26:38,I'm working a theory.
416,00:26:38,00:26:40,"Now, there are multiple murder weapons."
417,00:26:40,00:26:41,We only have one.
418,00:26:41,00:26:43,I checked the perimeter again. They're not here.
419,00:26:43,00:26:49,"All right, first responding said that a couple of bikers got away just as they showed up."
420,00:26:50,00:26:52,"Okay. Yeah, maybe they took the knives with them."
421,00:26:52,00:26:54,"All right, I'm one of them. I know the police are rolling."
422,00:26:54,00:26:58,"I don't want to get picked up carrying the weapon, so I'm going to ditch them as quickly as possible, right?"
423,00:26:58,00:27:03,"Right. But you know, you can use your department vehicle to look for that stuff."
424,00:27:03,00:27:05,"You want to catch a rat, you move like a rat."
425,00:27:05,00:27:07,Okay. Yeah.
426,00:27:07,00:27:09,"Yeah, responding units came in from the east and the west."
427,00:27:09,00:27:11,"All right, south of here is residential."
428,00:27:11,00:27:13,"Too many eyes, too many ears."
429,00:27:13,00:27:15,I'll start looking north.
430,00:27:16,00:27:18,Good luck.
431,00:27:18,00:27:19,(chuckles)
432,00:27:20,00:27:22,(engine revving)
433,00:28:21,00:28:23,(engines revving)
434,00:29:24,00:29:26,(dog barks in distance)
435,00:29:44,00:29:46,(dog barks in distance)
436,00:29:53,00:29:55,(metallic jangling)
437,00:30:14,00:30:17,All the knives I found match tool marks on the victim's body.
438,00:30:17,00:30:22,"And the prints we lifted match five of the bikers we have in custody, but none of them are talking."
439,00:30:22,00:30:26,"Well, if we don't find evidence on the rest of the bikers, the D.A.'s going to start releasing them."
440,00:30:26,00:30:27,I'm on it. Thanks.
441,00:30:31,00:30:32,You paged me?
442,00:30:32,00:30:36,Yeah. I got the call records from that phone at the bar.
443,00:30:36,00:30:39,There was an incoming call at 10:02 p.m.
444,00:30:39,00:30:43,"Okay, well, that's consistent with the undercover officer's statement."
445,00:30:43,00:30:44,Where did it originate?
446,00:30:45,00:30:47,Looks like it was from a pay phone.
447,00:30:51,00:30:54,The call to the bar came fromourpolice department?
448,00:31:01,00:31:03,Was Nettles dimed out by another cop?
449,00:31:03,00:31:06,BRASS: They're checking surveillance footage from the time of that call.
450,00:31:06,00:31:10,"Jim, I've heard you got a potential conflict of interest in this case."
451,00:31:11,00:31:13,"No, I don't."
452,00:31:15,00:31:16,"Okay, what do you got?"
453,00:31:16,00:31:17,Have a clean shot of the caller.
454,00:31:17,00:31:19,"All right, let's run it."
455,00:31:25,00:31:27,That's Rita.
456,00:31:29,00:31:32,I'd say you got a conflict now.
457,00:31:34,00:31:35,I don't know why I'm here.
458,00:31:35,00:31:36,I didn't kill Jack.
459,00:31:37,00:31:39,Tell me about your call to the Blasters' clubhouse.
460,00:31:39,00:31:41,How did you get that number?
461,00:31:41,00:31:43,Jack gave it to me.
462,00:31:43,00:31:50,"In case of emergencies, I'm supposed to call and ask for Joey Niagra, and say that I'm his mother."
463,00:31:50,00:31:51,"So, that's what you're doing in the photo? Yes."
464,00:31:51,00:31:53,Why did you use the phone here?
465,00:31:53,00:31:54,So that we'd think a cop made the call?
466,00:31:54,00:31:56,No. What did you say?
467,00:31:56,00:31:58,I-I asked for Jack.
468,00:31:58,00:32:01,I... For Joey. I-I... I just...
469,00:32:01,00:32:02,I just wanted to hear his voice.
470,00:32:02,00:32:04,ECKLIE: No. No.
471,00:32:04,00:32:05,You told them he was a cop. Isn't that right?
472,00:32:05,00:32:10,"No! You admitted you'd already lost him, but if you got a divorce, you'd end up with, what?"
473,00:32:10,00:32:12,"A pile of debt, and a house worth less than the mortgage."
474,00:32:12,00:32:13,Right? What are you doing?
475,00:32:13,00:32:16,"With one phone call, you got his death benefit and his pension."
476,00:32:16,00:32:18,That's not true!
477,00:32:27,00:32:29,(sighs)
478,00:32:29,00:32:33,ECKLIE: Tonya managed to get word back to Vice.
479,00:32:33,00:32:34,A cocaine shipment's in from Mexico.
480,00:32:34,00:32:35,Where? She doesn't know.
481,00:32:35,00:32:37,Wherever Scratch told them to drop it off.
482,00:32:37,00:32:39,"So, we got to find out who Scratch is."
483,00:32:39,00:32:40,He'll lead us to the drugs.
484,00:32:40,00:32:42,"In the meantime, Righteous Dogs are cruising the streets."
485,00:32:42,00:32:44,We need to find that coke before they do.
486,00:33:06,00:33:08,Looks like they released some more of the old ladies.
487,00:33:08,00:33:10,Yep.
488,00:33:12,00:33:16,There goes the victim's girlfriend.
489,00:33:21,00:33:22,(ignition turns)
490,00:33:34,00:33:37,This is Charlie-05-Stokes.
491,00:33:37,00:33:38,I'm on Rancho Destino south of Barston.
492,00:33:39,00:33:42,One of our U.C. vehicles just exploded with a U.C. officer inside the vehicle.
493,00:33:42,00:33:44,Send Fire and paramedics.
494,00:33:44,00:33:47,I repeat: U.C. officer was inside the vehicle.
495,00:34:04,00:34:08,Looks like the incendiary device detonated fast and big.
496,00:34:08,00:34:11,"Red paper, wax-coated."
497,00:34:11,00:34:13,This is dynamite.
498,00:34:13,00:34:15,They must've known Tonya was undercover.
499,00:34:16,00:34:21,"And from the moment the cops responded to the 911 call, we had this lot and the street under control."
500,00:34:21,00:34:23,This bomb's too sophisticated.
501,00:34:23,00:34:25,Must've been planted before Nettles was killed.
502,00:34:26,00:34:30,"Whether or not they knew Nettles was a cop, they were on to Tonya."
503,00:34:30,00:34:34,"And the order had to have come from the head guy, Scratch."
504,00:34:34,00:34:36,Makes sense. That's the guy she was after.
505,00:34:36,00:34:39,I'll head back with the body.
506,00:34:42,00:34:47,"WILLOWS: According to the blood evidence, the fight started here at the bar and moved forward."
507,00:34:47,00:34:52,Probably the first injury came from the tire chain to Nettles' left knee.
508,00:34:52,00:34:54,I'm Nettles.
509,00:34:54,00:34:59,I see what's going down and I make a run to go out the back.
510,00:34:59,00:35:01,I'm Smitty.
511,00:35:01,00:35:06,My prints were on the chain that was collected here.
512,00:35:07,00:35:10,I hit his left knee.
513,00:35:10,00:35:12,Nettles was facing in this direction.
514,00:35:12,00:35:15,(rock music blasting)
515,00:35:17,00:35:18,(yells)
516,00:35:23,00:35:25,"WILLOWS: So, now, you're down."
517,00:35:25,00:35:28,But you still have a weapon: your knife.
518,00:35:28,00:35:33,I think he was reaching for it when Jackass got in on the fight.
519,00:35:33,00:35:35,"Hodges, you're Jackass."
520,00:35:35,00:35:36,And don't I know it.
521,00:35:37,00:35:40,"All right, your knife matches cuts on Nettles' right arm."
522,00:35:40,00:35:43,"Okay, so, I'm over him."
523,00:35:44,00:35:45,(yells)
524,00:35:48,00:36:01,"All right, that cast-off over there could have been from the repeated stabbing of an area that bleeds heavily, such as the two clavicle wounds that match Hooper's knife."
525,00:36:01,00:36:08,"All right, in order for Hooper to reach the clavicle, I'll have to get down on my right knee..."
526,00:36:09,00:36:10,(groans)
527,00:36:11,00:36:13,(grunts)
528,00:36:13,00:36:17,"And at this point, his right arm is pretty much useless."
529,00:36:17,00:36:21,"So, he pulls himself with his left hand."
530,00:36:21,00:36:24,But they didn't stop.
531,00:36:24,00:36:25,Judge Death here...
532,00:36:25,00:36:28,stabbed him in the kidneys.
533,00:36:28,00:36:30,(grunting)
534,00:36:34,00:36:36,(pained yell)
535,00:36:36,00:36:39,And then he somehow managed to try to get to the front door.
536,00:36:39,00:36:42,And they let him because they knew he wasn't going to get very far.
537,00:36:45,00:36:47,(groaning)
538,00:36:47,00:36:50,And then they use Nettles' own knife on him.
539,00:36:50,00:36:55,But I think it was the stab to his temple that finally stopped him.
540,00:36:56,00:36:59,(sharp inhale)
541,00:36:59,00:37:01,(short exhale)
542,00:37:04,00:37:09,"LANGDON: And that's how we found him, and that proves a bar fight, but not a setup."
543,00:37:09,00:37:11,You're right.
544,00:37:11,00:37:18,"We know that Rita Nettles called here at 10:02 p.m., and the fight started right after that."
545,00:37:18,00:37:25,LANGSTON: It's unlikely that they would kill a member of their own gang or a cop without direct orders from Scratch.
546,00:37:25,00:37:30,"So, either Scratch was here, or whoever took the call contacted Scratch."
547,00:37:30,00:37:35,But there weren't any outgoing calls after 10:00 on any of the bikers' cell phones or the bar phone.
548,00:37:35,00:37:36,Wait a second.
549,00:37:50,00:37:52,There's a bug in here.
550,00:37:52,00:37:55,There was nothing in Nettles' case notes that mentioned one.
551,00:37:55,00:37:58,Nettles' iPod had a radio receiver.
552,00:37:58,00:38:01,If he was able to install a transmitter...
553,00:38:01,00:38:03,RITA: Let me talk to Joey!
554,00:38:03,00:38:04,BARTENDER: He's with his old lady.
555,00:38:04,00:38:06,"RITA: Tonya, is that her name?"
556,00:38:06,00:38:08,Huh? How young is she? Hmm?
557,00:38:08,00:38:10,She's real young?
558,00:38:10,00:38:13,He's a cop! You know that?
559,00:38:13,00:38:14,A cop!
560,00:38:14,00:38:16,His name is not Joey!
561,00:38:16,00:38:18,"BARTENDER: Hey, who is this?"
562,00:38:18,00:38:19,RITA: I'm his wife!
563,00:38:19,00:38:21,"Okay, all right, all right."
564,00:38:21,00:38:22,Jim...
565,00:38:22,00:38:27,Vice sent over another surveillance wiretap where a man identified as Scratch was recorded.
566,00:38:27,00:38:30,JOHNSON: I was able to grab enough to make a comparison.
567,00:38:35,00:38:38,"BARTENDER: Hey, who is this?"
568,00:38:38,00:38:39,"SCRATCH: Yo, what is this?"
569,00:38:42,00:38:44,"Hey, who is this? Yo, what is this?"
570,00:38:44,00:38:47,"So, Scratch is the bartender."
571,00:38:51,00:38:53,Nice chopper.
572,00:38:53,00:38:57,"If this paint is scratched, you got a problem."
573,00:39:03,00:39:07,(engines revving)
574,00:39:36,00:39:39,They all just left.
575,00:39:54,00:39:58,(beeping)
576,00:39:58,00:40:00,JOHNSON: I've got them.
577,00:40:00,00:40:02,They're moving east on Sunset Road.
578,00:40:03,00:40:07,Just turned south onto Hasbrook.
579,00:40:07,00:40:09,They're stopping behind an industrial building.
580,00:40:09,00:40:11,Number 2106.
581,00:40:27,00:40:28,It's Kenny.
582,00:40:39,00:40:42,(guns cocking)
583,00:40:45,00:40:48,"(chuckling): Sorry, Scratch."
584,00:40:51,00:40:53,Dogs found it first.
585,00:40:54,00:40:56,(sirens blaring)
586,00:40:59,00:41:01,Las Vegas Police!
587,00:41:04,00:41:06,OFFICER: Put your hands above your head!
588,00:41:06,00:41:08,Las Vegas Police!
589,00:41:08,00:41:11,Put your hands up!
590,00:41:17,00:41:20,Put your hands where I can see 'em!
591,00:41:21,00:41:23,(engine revving)
592,00:41:23,00:41:24,(tires squeal)
593,00:41:29,00:41:30,Stop!
594,00:41:33,00:41:34,(gunshots)
595,00:41:40,00:41:41,MAN: Not moving! I'm not moving!
596,00:41:41,00:41:43,"Hey, don't hate me, man."
597,00:41:43,00:41:45,(chuckling)
598,00:41:45,00:41:47,That bitch cop was easy to make.
599,00:41:47,00:41:50,And your boy Joey should've took care of his wife.
600,00:41:50,00:41:52,Shut up.
601,00:42:25,00:42:29,I know this is your favorite way of wrapping up a tough case.
602,00:42:29,00:42:33,Little scotch... little talk.
603,00:42:35,00:42:38,You feel like talking?
604,00:42:47,00:42:49,"All right, then."
