0	00:00:28	00:00:30	I'm not saying I don't like Vegas.
1	00:00:30	00:00:33	I'm just saying L.A. clearly owns it in a number of key categories.
2	00:00:33	00:00:35	Vegas has no heart, no history...
3	00:00:35	00:00:37	No history?
4	00:00:37	00:00:38	No taxes ought to quiet your complaints.
5	00:00:38	00:00:40	No ocean.
6	00:00:40	00:00:42	All right, Morgan, I'll give you the ocean.
7	00:00:42	00:00:44	And the weather, and the Lakers.
8	00:00:44	00:00:48	And the ability to walk down the street without being handed full-frontal business cards.
9	00:00:48	00:00:51	Okay, but if you think L.A. beats Vegas at night, you need professional help.
10	00:00:51	00:00:53	Oh! You offering your services?
11	00:00:53	00:00:56	Hey, guys, please, we're here for a crime scene.
12	00:00:56	00:00:58	(helicopter rotors whirring) What is that?
13	00:01:09	00:01:11	CSI Russell?
14	00:01:11	00:01:13	Rescue helicopter? Yes, sir.
15	00:01:13	00:01:15	We just drove 70 miles.
16	00:01:15	00:01:16	We were promised murder.
17	00:01:16	00:01:18	And you had it, till 30 minutes ago.
18	00:01:18	00:01:20	What, the vic came back to life?
19	00:01:20	00:01:22	He didn't have a pulse when I found him on my patrol.
20	00:01:22	00:01:24	Called it in-- all of a sudden, he groans.
21	00:01:24	00:01:28	Document everything before we lose him.
22	00:01:28	00:01:30	GSW in the shoulder. Right, let's get him loaded.
23	00:01:30	00:01:32	Looks like a bullet graze wound on the forehead.
24	00:01:32	00:01:34	Two gunshot wounds, no blood pool?
25	00:01:34	00:01:36	This can't be the primary.
26	00:01:36	00:01:39	Get a shot of his wrist. Those are abrasions.
27	00:01:39	00:01:40	That guy was bound.
28	00:01:40	00:01:41	(phone rings) Yeah. And burned.
29	00:01:41	00:01:43	Looks like two stun gun marks on his neck.
30	00:01:43	00:01:45	Spike 80-50 push.
31	00:01:45	00:01:47	No wallet? Nothing.
32	00:01:47	00:01:48	Yeah!
33	00:01:48	00:01:50	Hey, it's Nick.
34	00:01:50	00:01:52	I just landed a double in Northtown.
35	00:01:52	00:01:54	Is there anybody around who can give me a hand?
36	00:01:54	00:01:56	Catherine and Sara are in court.
37	00:01:56	00:01:57	It's your lucky day.
38	00:01:57	00:02:00	Our Mount Stirling D.B. just Frankensteined on me.
39	00:02:00	00:02:03	So I'll send someone your way. Okay, that'd be good. Thanks.
40	00:02:05	00:02:08	Hey, Greg, why don't you hop on the chopper?
41	00:02:08	00:02:11	Process our vic at the hospital, then head over to Northtown.
42	00:02:11	00:02:13	Nick has a double he's having trouble with.
43	00:02:13	00:02:16	Oh, you want me to leave this gorgeous crime scenery?
44	00:02:16	00:02:17	I'll do it.
45	00:02:18	00:02:20	All right, you go.
46	00:02:20	00:02:23	We'll stay. A chopper ride and a double homicide?
47	00:02:23	00:02:25	I'm up for some excitement.
48	00:03:27	00:03:28	Miss me already?
49	00:03:28	00:03:31	00.
50	00:03:31	00:03:33	I think I just found the rest of your scene.
51	00:03:33	00:03:35	I won't tell Russell I gave you the tip.
52	00:03:35	00:03:36	You can look smart and owe me one.
53	00:03:36	00:03:38	All right, thanks.
54	00:03:42	00:03:45	Hey, sweetheart, it might get a little bumpy.
55	00:03:51	00:03:53	No sign of forced entry.
56	00:03:53	00:03:56	Mailman spotted them through the iron barred windows.
57	00:03:56	00:03:58	Mailman delivers door-to-door in this neighborhood?
58	00:03:58	00:04:01	Takes some serious mail-sack.
59	00:04:01	00:04:02	Yeah.
60	00:04:02	00:04:05	So was the TV or stereo on when the officers responded?
61	00:04:05	00:04:07	The whole system was blaring.
62	00:04:07	00:04:09	I know both of these guys.
63	00:04:09	00:04:11	Wes Aykin, Tony Malos.
64	00:04:11	00:04:17	I busted them for some juvie stuff a while back, but now their ink tells me they've turned pro.
65	00:04:17	00:04:18	Yeah, Mad-10?
66	00:04:18	00:04:20	Madison and Tenth.
67	00:04:20	00:04:23	That's the gang/syndicate that runs this hood.
68	00:04:23	00:04:28	Diversified portfolio-- drugs, extortion, prostitution, Internet porn.
69	00:04:28	00:04:31	Mm-hmm, and quite the racket with the fake credit cards.
70	00:04:31	00:04:34	The killer sure did leave behind a lot of plastic.
71	00:04:34	00:04:37	You know, it doesn't seem like this was about business.
72	00:04:37	00:04:39	Maybe it was personal.
73	00:04:50	00:04:52	Metal shavings.
74	00:04:57	00:05:00	Coming from the back door.
75	00:05:03	00:05:05	Yep. Here's our point of entry.
76	00:05:05	00:05:07	Plasma cutter.
77	00:05:07	00:05:08	Slashed right through the metal.
78	00:05:10	00:05:19	Inert gas and an electrical arc create an ultra-hot plasma that chews right through the metal.
79	00:05:32	00:05:34	Hey, here it is right here.
80	00:05:41	00:05:43	Stolen from Ronston Welding.
81	00:05:43	00:05:45	I'll give 'em a call.
82	00:05:45	00:05:47	Casa de Brass could use some discounted pipe work.
83	00:05:55	00:05:56	What can I do?
84	00:05:56	00:05:58	Just stand back.
85	00:05:58	00:06:00	I've got epi running. He's gone back into V-fib.
86	00:06:00	00:06:01	I'm going to shock again.
87	00:06:01	00:06:02	Clear.
88	00:06:04	00:06:06	Actually, lift the lids.
89	00:06:06	00:06:08	No pupil reaction.
90	00:06:08	00:06:11	One more time. Clear.
91	00:06:18	00:06:20	There we go. Welcome back, buddy.
92	00:06:20	00:06:23	You're on your way to the hospital.
93	00:06:27	00:06:30	Samantha...
94	00:06:32	00:06:34	Samantha.
95	00:06:48	00:06:50	Hey, boys.
96	00:06:50	00:06:52	Didn't hear you come in.
97	00:06:52	00:06:53	What's going on?
98	00:06:53	00:06:55	We already flipped 'em and sticked 'em.
99	00:06:55	00:06:56	Both died around midnight.
100	00:06:58	00:07:01	I notice some burn marks on the neck consistent with a stun gun.
101	00:07:01	00:07:04	Those are some pretty nasty neck wounds.
102	00:07:04	00:07:06	They were both garroted.
103	00:07:06	00:07:08	I found that wire under this victim.
104	00:07:11	00:07:13	Hmm.
105	00:07:16	00:07:19	Okay.
106	00:07:19	00:07:20	This attack was clearly planned.
107	00:07:20	00:07:23	The killer used a plasma cutter to gain entry.
108	00:07:23	00:07:25	He must have known it was a good time to strike.
109	00:07:25	00:07:27	Yo, where's the beer?
110	00:07:27	00:07:30	What the...?!
111	00:07:32	00:07:34	Why are you doing this to us?!
112	00:07:37	00:07:41	There are easier ways to end two men.
113	00:07:41	00:07:45	The killer was either getting off, or trying to get something out of them.
114	00:07:49	00:07:52	You sure about this, Greg?
115	00:07:52	00:07:54	Sure as I can be.
116	00:07:55	00:07:58	Oh, there you go.
117	00:07:58	00:08:00	Good hunch, buddy. Way to call it.
118	00:08:00	00:08:03	Eh, just trusting my instincts.
119	00:08:11	00:08:15	Looks like we've got two nine mill casings over here.
120	00:08:21	00:08:27	So one shot goes into our victim's shoulder, and... Oh, yes.
121	00:08:29	00:08:31	One shot grazes his head.
122	00:08:33	00:08:36	Definitely our primary.
123	00:08:36	00:08:38	Maybe more than that.
124	00:08:39	00:08:41	Second blood pool.
125	00:08:41	00:08:43	Two more casings.
126	00:08:43	00:08:46	We got a second gunshot victim? I don't know.
127	00:08:46	00:08:48	Not much blood.
128	00:08:48	00:08:51	And it looks like the ground took the brunt of these shots.
129	00:08:57	00:09:00	No blood or tissue on these bullets.
130	00:09:00	00:09:02	Maybe they didn't hit anybody.
131	00:09:02	00:09:08	Okay, so maybe both of our blood pools come from our guy on the chopper, right?
132	00:09:10	00:09:12	Let's keep looking.
133	00:09:23	00:09:26	Ah, found his jacket.
134	00:09:26	00:09:29	And I think I found his ride.
135	00:09:29	00:09:31	Tire impressions.
136	00:09:33	00:09:35	Wide axle.
137	00:09:35	00:09:37	Pickup or SUV?
138	00:09:37	00:09:42	So they drive our victim up here, they shoot him, and then they leave him for dead.
139	00:09:42	00:09:44	His hands and knees were caked with dirt.
140	00:09:46	00:09:49	He tried to crawl to the road.
141	00:09:54	00:09:56	Yeah, here we go.
142	00:09:57	00:09:59	Got a bloody print.
143	00:09:59	00:10:02	I'll send a photo to Mandy for an I.D.
144	00:10:04	00:10:06	Save your powder.
145	00:10:06	00:10:08	We have a suspect.
146	00:10:08	00:10:14	Yeah? Who is it? Ronston the welder told me that an assistant of his ran off with a bunch of equipment last night, and didn't show up for work today.
147	00:10:14	00:10:16	His name is Frank Cafferty and he has a record.
148	00:10:16	00:10:21	Got out six months ago after doing a ten-year stint for manslaughter.
149	00:10:21	00:10:24	Ah, thatagirl, Mandy.
150	00:10:24	00:10:27	Look, she sent us a match for our print.
151	00:10:27	00:10:32	So our guy in the chopper is a Frank Cafferty.
152	00:10:32	00:10:34	That's a little weird.
153	00:10:41	00:10:42	Stokes.
154	00:10:42	00:10:45	Yeah, Nick, you just entered a print for a Frank Cafferty into the system.
155	00:10:45	00:10:47	Yeah, he's my suspect over here.
156	00:10:47	00:10:50	Double homicide. Yeah, he's our victim.
157	00:10:52	00:10:54	You mean the exact same guy that's...
158	00:10:54	00:10:56	Yeah, up in the air with Morgan.
159	00:11:00	00:11:04	This is Medevac 103.
160	00:11:04	00:11:07	(phone ringing) Estimated time of arrival at Desert Palm 0945.
161	00:11:07	00:11:09	Tracing Route 160 toward Wilson Ridge.
162	00:11:09	00:11:10	Still in the air, boss.
163	00:11:12	00:11:14	Really?
164	00:11:14	00:11:16	The Northtown double?
165	00:11:19	00:11:21	Copy that.
166	00:11:21	00:11:24	I'll make sure he's in custody when we land.
167	00:11:30	00:11:33	He's convulsing! Protect him!
168	00:11:33	00:11:37	Get the I.V.-- Hey! Get back!
169	00:11:41	00:11:42	Hey!
170	00:11:42	00:11:45	I see you touch that radio, or punch in codes, bitch is dead, you hear me?
171	00:11:45	00:11:47	Yeah. Unstrap me.
172	00:11:47	00:11:50	I said unstrap me or the cop eats it!
173	00:11:50	00:11:51	I'm not a cop... Now!
174	00:12:09	00:12:11	Listen up!
175	00:12:11	00:12:12	I want your cans off and your cell phones!
176	00:12:12	00:12:14	Throw 'em back!
177	00:12:14	00:12:16	Now! Hurry up! Come on!
178	00:12:16	00:12:17	Now!
179	00:12:22	00:12:25	You! Due south. Fly low.
180	00:12:25	00:12:30	I see a town, a cop, or a highway, it's the last thing you see.
181	00:12:30	00:12:32	You got it?
182	00:12:32	00:12:33	Yeah.
183	00:12:36	00:12:37	Where are we going?
184	00:12:37	00:12:39	Mexico.
185	00:12:39	00:12:43	I'm not sure how much we there's gonna be about it.
186	00:12:51	00:12:53	So Morgan's still not at your scene?
187	00:12:53	00:12:55	No, it's been over an hour.
188	00:12:55	00:12:56	She should've gotten there by now.
189	00:12:56	00:12:59	All right, well, I'll check with Medevac Dispatch.
190	00:12:59	00:13:00	Do you still need a hand?
191	00:13:00	00:13:01	Nah, I'm good.
192	00:13:01	00:13:05	Catherine and Sarah finished in court and they're checking out Frank Cafferty's address.
193	00:13:05	00:13:08	All right, good. Thank you.
194	00:13:08	00:13:10	No service on Morgan's cell.
195	00:13:10	00:13:12	Dispatch.
196	00:13:12	00:13:15	Uh, yeah, this is D.B. Russell with Crime Lab.
197	00:13:15	00:13:21	Do you have an ETA on a Medevac Three, heading from Mount Stirling to Desert Palm Hospital?
198	00:13:21	00:13:26	Negative. We've been unable to reestablish radio contact with Medevac Three.
199	00:13:26	00:13:29	All right, well, check with Air Traffic Control, will you, please?
200	00:13:29	00:13:32	Yes, sir.
201	00:13:32	00:13:35	Maybe they're taking the scenic route.
202	00:13:35	00:13:37	Looks like a match.
203	00:13:37	00:13:42	Stun gun burns on Frank Cafferty's neck and the necks of these dead Mad-10s are three of a kind.
204	00:13:42	00:13:46	Well, Sara and I just got back from Cafferty's apartment.
205	00:13:46	00:13:49	The door had been kicked in, there were signs of a struggle...
206	00:13:49	00:13:57	So Cafferty zapped and killed these fine gentlemen in Northtown, retired for the evening...
207	00:13:57	00:14:05	Somebody else-- probably from their crew-- went after Frank, busted into his place, used a stun gun on him, then dragged him out and up to the mountains.
208	00:14:05	00:14:08	Any idea what started the feud?
209	00:14:08	00:14:09	Well, Frank'll be at the hospital soon.
210	00:14:09	00:14:11	I'm sure he's got all kinds of answers.
211	00:14:27	00:14:29	Who's Samantha?
212	00:14:32	00:14:34	You might've been dreaming.
213	00:14:34	00:14:36	You kind of muttered it while you were under.
214	00:14:36	00:14:38	I wasn't dreaming.
215	00:14:38	00:14:41	Is she someone special?
216	00:14:46	00:14:48	What'd you do? Nothing.
217	00:14:48	00:14:49	You moved! You're trying to do something.
218	00:14:49	00:14:50	I didn't move. You're on medication.
219	00:14:50	00:14:52	Your vision's compromised.
220	00:14:52	00:14:53	Oh, yeah? You want to test my vision, Doc?
221	00:14:53	00:14:54	Frank, come on, it's not worth it.
222	00:14:58	00:14:59	Please...
223	00:15:00	00:15:03	Put him down. What?
224	00:15:03	00:15:04	Drug him! I don't want him moving!
225	00:15:05	00:15:07	I said drug him.
226	00:15:07	00:15:09	five... four...
227	00:15:09	00:15:11	Midazolam-- two ccs, front pouch, clear bottle.
228	00:15:13	00:15:15	Hurry! Do it!
229	00:15:15	00:15:16	Quit eyeballing me.
230	00:15:19	00:15:20	Turn around!
231	00:15:24	00:15:25	Hurry up!
232	00:15:35	00:15:38	That's right. Now, sit back...
233	00:15:38	00:15:40	enjoy the ride.
234	00:15:44	00:15:47	Okay, thanks, Jim.
235	00:15:47	00:15:49	So Brass dug in to Cafferty's file.
236	00:15:49	00:15:51	There were no gang connections.
237	00:15:51	00:15:54	The guy spent the past ten years in prison for a bar fight gone bad.
238	00:15:54	00:16:01	There was no gang beef while he was in lockup, and prior to prison, he was in the service-- chopper pilot.
239	00:16:01	00:16:07	You know, I've been going through the stuff from his apartment-- you know, he doesn't strike me as a gangbanger.
240	00:16:07	00:16:11	So what was he doing in that house, torturing and killing two Mad-10s?
241	00:16:11	00:16:13	Did Brass say anything about a daughter?
242	00:16:13	00:16:15	Actually, yes.
243	00:16:15	00:16:19	His Army file claimed that he was divorced with one dependent.
244	00:16:19	00:16:21	Hm.
245	00:16:21	00:16:24	Daughter's name is Samantha.
246	00:16:24	00:16:26	She sent him a letter in prison, four years ago.
247	00:16:26	00:16:28	I've got a better man in my life now.
248	00:16:28	00:16:31	He looks out for me like you never have.
249	00:16:31	00:16:34	You asked me for a recent photo-- here you go.
250	00:16:34	00:16:36	Well, she grew up.
251	00:16:36	00:16:37	Ouch.
252	00:16:39	00:16:42	I've seen him before.
253	00:16:45	00:16:47	That's one of the Mad-10s that Frank Cafferty killed.
254	00:16:47	00:16:49	Now we know why.
255	00:16:49	00:16:50	So the daughter is the connection.
256	00:16:52	00:16:54	Hi, Russell.
257	00:16:59	00:17:01	And that's all we know?
258	00:17:01	00:17:04	Hey... we need to talk.
259	00:17:04	00:17:06	Uh-oh. Which one was it this time?
260	00:17:06	00:17:08	Morgan.
261	00:17:08	00:17:09	Well, that didn't take long.
262	00:17:09	00:17:10	How'd she screw up?
263	00:17:10	00:17:11	Well, she didn't, actually.
264	00:17:11	00:17:13	Let me talk to you for a second.
265	00:17:15	00:17:20	She hitched a ride on a medevac helicopter that was supposed to land an hour ago.
266	00:17:20	00:17:22	No sign of it yet.
267	00:17:22	00:17:24	Was there a distress call?
268	00:17:24	00:17:30	No. No radio, no transponder signal, no appearance on radar.
269	00:17:30	00:17:33	Now, look-- this is my team, my responsibility.
270	00:17:33	00:17:34	Yeah-- my daughter.
271	00:17:34	00:17:36	I know. I know.
272	00:17:36	00:17:39	Then again, you're a better supervisor than I ever was a father.
273	00:17:41	00:17:43	Air Traffic Control better have some answers.
274	00:17:43	00:17:47	When he took off from Mount Stirling, the pilot reported his flight plan to Dispatch.
275	00:17:47	00:17:49	Estimated time of arrival...
276	00:17:49	00:17:56	Because of the patient's head wound, he wanted to avoid altitude, so he was going to trace Route 160 and cut across Wilson Ridge toward the city.
277	00:17:56	00:18:05	Now, McCarran radar can't pick up aircraft blocked by the mountains, 27 a.m., the copter was here.
278	00:18:05	00:18:09	Now, it should've emerged from behind the mountains, and onto McCarran radar six or seven minutes later.
279	00:18:09	00:18:11	It never emerged.
280	00:18:11	00:18:17	Archie pinged the cells of Morgan, the pilot and paramedic-- all three were emanating from a one-acre area here.
281	00:18:19	00:18:24	Sheriff's deputies recovered the phones, but no sign of any wreckage.
282	00:18:24	00:18:28	Cafferty-- he made 'em toss the phones.
283	00:18:28	00:18:29	That chopper's hijacked.
284	00:18:29	00:18:31	Okay...
285	00:18:31	00:18:32	All right, we keep working the case.
286	00:18:32	00:18:37	I want to find out everything we can about Frank Cafferty, in case we make contact with him.
287	00:18:37	00:18:39	I was supposed to be the CSI on that flight.
288	00:18:39	00:18:42	We don't have time for that right now.
289	00:18:42	00:18:45	Let's just stay focused, and make sure we bring our girl home, okay?
290	00:18:45	00:18:48	Why don't you check out Sara, see what she's got.
291	00:18:48	00:18:53	So I think I know why Cafferty was at that Northtown house-- he was looking for his daughter.
292	00:18:53	00:18:59	Samantha used to go out with Wes Aykin, one of the dead Mad-10s.
293	00:18:59	00:19:03	So, Cafferty figures that Wes and the rest of the gang might know where she was, right?
294	00:19:03	00:19:04	Well, it was more than a hunch.
295	00:19:04	00:19:06	He had seen some awful proof.
296	00:19:06	00:19:09	I'd found a Web address jotted among Frank's possessions.
297	00:19:09	00:19:11	The URL-- it's a file-sharing site.
298	00:19:11	00:19:13	Specifically, one file.
299	00:19:17	00:19:18	Porn video.
300	00:19:18	00:19:20	She looks drugged.
301	00:19:20	00:19:21	Yeah.
302	00:19:21	00:19:24	So Cafferty sees this and wants to rescue his daughter.
303	00:19:24	00:19:27	Tries to strangle her whereabouts out of Wes and Tony.
304	00:19:27	00:19:28	Right? Mm-hmm.
305	00:19:28	00:19:30	So do we know where she is?
306	00:19:30	00:19:37	No. She renewed her license a month ago, but the address she used is a weekly, and she's no longer there.
307	00:19:37	00:19:40	Tire treads Greg photo'd at the mountain scene.
308	00:19:40	00:19:46	They're high-end run-flats-- standard on a number of luxury SUVs-- Lexus, BMW, Porsche...
309	00:19:46	00:19:48	Cafferty had a digital camera.
310	00:19:48	00:19:51	There were some amateur surveillance photos on it.
311	00:19:51	00:19:54	He was tracking the Mad-10s.
312	00:19:54	00:19:56	Probably since he got out of prison.
313	00:19:56	00:20:00	Their properties, cars, including...
314	00:20:00	00:20:01	a Porsche Cayenne.
315	00:20:01	00:20:05	So that could be the vehicle that took Cafferty up into the mountains.
316	00:20:05	00:20:07	Partial plate-- I'll run it through DMV.
317	00:20:07	00:20:18	I had all the techs and interns put out a photo file on the copter-- e-mail, Twitter-- If you see this, let us know.
318	00:20:18	00:20:19	Good idea.
319	00:20:19	00:20:22	She's a really good CSI.
320	00:20:24	00:20:26	Nick, you got anything?
321	00:20:26	00:20:33	Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base, 100 miles south of Mount Stirling, reported a non-transponding radio-silent craft in their airspace 15 minutes ago.
322	00:20:33	00:20:36	Guy in the tower said it looked like Medevac Three.
323	00:20:36	00:20:38	By the time we got the message, it was off radar.
324	00:20:38	00:20:39	So they're heading due south.
325	00:20:39	00:20:41	What, Mexico?
326	00:20:41	00:20:42	CHP's on the lookout, but they haven't seen it.
327	00:20:42	00:20:46	You know, Cafferty may have the pilot zigging and zagging around up there.
328	00:20:46	00:20:50	Yeah, well, even if they're straight-lining it, they're gonna have to refuel before they get to the border.
329	00:20:50	00:20:52	Every airstrip between here and there's got a heads-up, so...
330	00:20:52	00:20:55	I got that DNA on the two blood pools you and Greg found at the mountain scene.
331	00:20:55	00:20:57	The big pool was Cafferty.
332	00:20:57	00:20:59	The small pool was a second contributor-- a female.
333	00:20:59	00:21:00	Cafferty's daughter?
334	00:21:00	00:21:02	No, a 19-year-old named Tiffany Bamford.
335	00:21:02	00:21:05	She's got priors for assault; and ties to the Mad-10s.
336	00:21:05	00:21:07	And I checked hospitals-- she's at Desert Palm.
337	00:21:10	00:21:12	They didn't want me comin' here but...
338	00:21:12	00:21:14	my head just kept hurting worse.
339	00:21:14	00:21:16	Who didn't want you to come here, Tiffany?
340	00:21:16	00:21:18	Who did this to you? Hmm?
341	00:21:18	00:21:20	Was it the Mad-10s?
342	00:21:20	00:21:23	They said they weren't really going to do anything to me.
343	00:21:23	00:21:25	Supposed to be fake.
344	00:21:25	00:21:27	Just mess with this guy. Get some cred.
345	00:21:27	00:21:29	They took me out there.
346	00:21:29	00:21:31	Want your daughter, Frank?
347	00:21:31	00:21:32	Here she is.
348	00:21:32	00:21:33	No...
349	00:21:34	00:21:36	Look what you've made us do to her!
350	00:21:36	00:21:37	No!
351	00:21:39	00:21:41	Samantha!
352	00:21:41	00:21:43	No!
353	00:21:43	00:21:45	Samantha!
354	00:21:45	00:21:46	Samantha!
355	00:21:46	00:21:47	I'm gonna kill you!
356	00:21:47	00:21:48	You hear me?
357	00:21:49	00:21:50	No! No!
358	00:21:50	00:21:52	Samantha!
359	00:21:52	00:21:53	Tell me their names.
360	00:21:55	00:21:57	I'll protect you, I promise.
361	00:22:08	00:22:10	Can I help you with something?
362	00:22:10	00:22:11	Thought this was my grandmother's room.
363	00:22:11	00:22:13	Yeah, well, it's not. My mistake.
364	00:22:13	00:22:15	Yeah, it is your mistake. Beat it.
365	00:22:19	00:22:23	Now, Tiffany, we can post an officer right outside of your room... Get out.
366	00:22:24	00:22:26	Get out!
367	00:22:29	00:22:32	So these guys wanted Frank to think they killed Samantha.
368	00:22:32	00:22:36	The fact that they had to fake it says... what?
369	00:22:36	00:22:39	She was already dead but they couldn't produce a body?
370	00:22:39	00:22:41	Or she's still alive; they couldn't get their hands on her.
371	00:22:41	00:22:43	And what if we did?
372	00:22:43	00:22:45	What if we find her, and let Frank know she's still alive?
373	00:22:45	00:22:47	That might just bring him back down.
374	00:22:47	00:22:49	Yeah, but how are we gonna find her? No address, no phone number.
375	00:22:49	00:22:53	And in the meantime, Frank Cafferty thinks he watched his own daughter's murder.
376	00:22:53	00:22:58	I can't help but think what that might mean for my daughter.
377	00:23:12	00:23:13	She's dead.
378	00:23:15	00:23:18	My daughter, Samantha.
379	00:23:18	00:23:21	You asked.
380	00:23:27	00:23:29	What happened?
381	00:23:29	00:23:32	When she was little, I was, um...
382	00:23:32	00:23:34	I was a bad person, you know?
383	00:23:34	00:23:41	I went away. She ended up getting mixed in with the wrong crowd.
384	00:23:41	00:23:44	When I got out...
385	00:23:44	00:23:47	I tried to save her.
386	00:23:47	00:23:50	You wanted a second chance. Yeah.
387	00:23:52	00:23:54	Ended up getting her killed.
388	00:23:54	00:23:57	How?
389	00:24:05	00:24:10	A month ago, I sat down with my dad for the first time in a dozen years.
390	00:24:10	00:24:12	He left when you were little, too?
391	00:24:12	00:24:19	When I was about 14 and he'd messed up so much that my mom decided she wanted to leave for California...
392	00:24:19	00:24:23	he didn't fight for me to stay.
393	00:24:25	00:24:28	If he'd only just fought for me.
394	00:24:28	00:24:31	That would've been enough?
395	00:24:36	00:24:39	You finally forgave him?
396	00:24:39	00:24:43	I finally decided it was worth a shot.
397	00:24:43	00:24:46	So we're starting over.
398	00:24:50	00:24:53	Whatever mistakes he made...
399	00:24:53	00:24:57	we can get past them.
400	00:24:57	00:24:59	People change.
401	00:24:59	00:25:02	He's a better man now.
402	00:25:02	00:25:05	He had a second chance.
403	00:25:16	00:25:18	Look what you made me do!
404	00:25:18	00:25:21	(groans) Look what you made me do!
405	00:25:21	00:25:26	Don't you move. You hear me? Don't you move.
406	00:25:26	00:25:28	Okay.
407	00:25:28	00:25:29	Excuse me, Undersheriff?
408	00:25:29	00:25:31	This young woman needs to talk to you.
409	00:25:31	00:25:32	Not the time, Shelley.
410	00:25:32	00:25:34	I saw on the news about my dad.
411	00:25:34	00:25:37	The, uh, helicopter.
412	00:25:37	00:25:40	Samantha.
413	00:25:40	00:25:42	I want to help.
414	00:25:50	00:25:53	Your father's been up in the air with hostages for over two hours.
415	00:25:53	00:25:56	Do you have any idea which way he's going?
416	00:25:56	00:25:57	I don't know.
417	00:25:57	00:26:00	I-I barely know him.
418	00:26:00	00:26:05	Letters, when he was in prison, a handful of weekends before that, but we have never been close.
419	00:26:05	00:26:07	You don't understand. He was trying to save you.
420	00:26:07	00:26:13	Samantha, your Dad knew that you were caught up with the Mad-10s.
421	00:26:13	00:26:15	He was trying to rescue you.
422	00:26:17	00:26:19	I didn't need his help.
423	00:26:22	00:26:25	I checked out of that life a year ago.
424	00:26:25	00:26:26	I'm sober.
425	00:26:26	00:26:28	I'm just trying to live quiet.
426	00:26:30	00:26:33	So, you know what, all of this is just...
427	00:26:33	00:26:36	No, you know what? My daughter is on that helicopter.
428	00:26:36	00:26:41	Along with an innocent pilot and a paramedic, who both have families.
429	00:26:47	00:26:49	I know.
430	00:26:49	00:26:51	That's what they said on the news.
431	00:26:51	00:26:53	That's why I'm here. Not to help him.
432	00:26:55	00:26:59	I just don't want to see him hurt anyone else.
433	00:27:02	00:27:04	So how do I talk to him?
434	00:27:06	00:27:09	Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
435	00:27:09	00:27:11	Do you copy?
436	00:27:11	00:27:14	Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
437	00:27:14	00:27:16	He's either not hearing it, or he's not buying it.
438	00:27:16	00:27:18	No, no, he's probably cruising at a lower altitude.
439	00:27:18	00:27:21	You know, he'll hear it when he rises above the crest.
440	00:27:21	00:27:25	I appreciate the rationalization, I really do.
441	00:27:25	00:27:28	When it comes to Morgan, I've become something of a master at it.
442	00:27:28	00:27:33	She's 14; she doesn't understand what her mom and I are arguing about.
443	00:27:33	00:27:37	16-year-olds are all moody, they... she doesn't mean it.
444	00:27:37	00:27:40	She'll call. She's busy at school.
445	00:27:40	00:27:42	She's busy at work. She'll call. She'll call.
446	00:27:42	00:27:44	She'll call. And then she's here.
447	00:27:44	00:27:49	Chip the size of the stratosphere on her shoulder, still vowing eternal vengeance against me, but, uh...
448	00:27:49	00:27:51	Hey, you know what?
449	00:27:51	00:27:53	This could be a second chance for you guys.
450	00:27:53	00:27:56	Maybe.
451	00:27:56	00:27:59	It just cannot end like this.
452	00:28:02	00:28:05	Hey, Catherine? That Porsche Cayenne from Cafferty's surveillance photos.
453	00:28:05	00:28:10	DMV had only three matches to the partial plate, but one of them was in the Mad-10s' neighborhood.
454	00:28:10	00:28:12	It's registered to an Alexander Zadian.
455	00:28:12	00:28:15	Brass says he's a shot caller for the Mad-10s.
456	00:28:15	00:28:20	Priors for assault, extortion, possession with intent, and he's on the street right now.
457	00:28:20	00:28:22	And the best suspect for the attempted murder of Frank Cafferty.
458	00:28:22	00:28:24	Uniforms are out looking for Zadian.
459	00:28:24	00:28:25	I will let you know if their luck changes. Thank you.
460	00:28:28	00:28:29	Well, it's your call, Ace.
461	00:28:29	00:28:31	We're ten minutes out from Parham Airstrip.
462	00:28:31	00:28:34	We touch down and refuel, or this party's not going much longer.
463	00:28:36	00:28:38	Shut him up! Go to hell.
464	00:28:38	00:28:40	We got to get him to a hospital. Please, Frank.
465	00:28:40	00:28:43	I'll stay with you. Just let us land and get him some help.
466	00:28:43	00:28:44	I can't. Please!
467	00:28:44	00:28:46	I can't do that! (groans)
468	00:28:46	00:28:48	Shut him up! (groans)
469	00:28:56	00:28:59	Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
470	00:28:59	00:29:00	Do you copy?
471	00:29:00	00:29:04	Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
472	00:29:04	00:29:05	Do you copy?
473	00:29:06	00:29:09	This is Frank Cafferty.
474	00:29:09	00:29:10	Come on.
475	00:29:10	00:29:13	Frank? This is D.B. Russell, L.V.P.D.
476	00:29:13	00:29:16	There's someone here who would like to talk to you.
477	00:29:22	00:29:25	Go ahead.
478	00:29:26	00:29:27	Dad?
479	00:29:29	00:29:31	Samantha?
480	00:29:31	00:29:33	Oh, my God, baby.
481	00:29:33	00:29:34	Sammy, I thought you were dead.
482	00:29:34	00:29:36	The police told me.
483	00:29:36	00:29:39	That wasn't me, Dad. I'm... I'm fine.
484	00:29:42	00:29:46	They also told me you were trying to rescue me.
485	00:29:46	00:29:47	I tried, Samantha.
486	00:29:47	00:29:50	I tried as hard as I could.
487	00:29:54	00:29:59	You remember when I was little, that, uh, wishing well you told me was mine?
488	00:29:59	00:30:02	Of course I do, baby.
489	00:30:02	00:30:05	Go there. I've sent someone to help you get away. I love you, Dad.
490	00:30:05	00:30:07	Frank? Get her out of here!
491	00:30:07	00:30:09	I don't want her talking to anyone! Frank?
492	00:30:16	00:30:19	Go north. Hey, come on, man. We're not gonna make it to the next airstrip.
493	00:30:19	00:30:21	I got no problem flying solo.
494	00:30:21	00:30:23	Don't you want to see her?
495	00:30:23	00:30:25	Now!
496	00:30:25	00:30:29	Maybe next life, you keep a better grip on your pistol.
497	00:30:34	00:30:41	While Greg and I work on figuring out what the wishing well might be, I want the two of you to work on who Samantha might have sent out to meet Frank, okay?
498	00:30:41	00:30:43	Now, she didn't have a cell phone on her, so...
499	00:30:43	00:30:45	She might've stashed that in her car at P.D.
500	00:30:45	00:30:50	We check her recents, see if we can find the getaway driver she contacted, maybe we can intercept or follow.
501	00:30:50	00:30:52	Good. Yeah, let's do it.
502	00:30:54	00:30:57	Why not let Frank get away?
503	00:30:57	00:31:02	Wouldn't it be safer for Morgan and the others if we just let him land?
504	00:31:02	00:31:04	Let him run.
505	00:31:04	00:31:05	I don't think so.
506	00:31:05	00:31:08	Why the hell not?
507	00:31:09	00:31:13	Because I'm not so sure that Samantha's trying to help him get away.
508	00:31:13	00:31:15	That girl hates her father for leaving her.
509	00:31:15	00:31:17	Now, what's more likely, that she wants to help him or hurt him?
510	00:31:20	00:31:22	That's why. You gonna be okay?
511	00:31:22	00:31:24	Yeah.
512	00:31:24	00:31:26	Good.
513	00:31:28	00:31:34	Samantha Cafferty arrived at P.D. at around 11 Let's see what she was driving.
514	00:31:39	00:31:40	Black Cayenne.
515	00:31:43	00:31:45	Zoom in.
516	00:31:55	00:31:57	That's Zadian.
517	00:31:57	00:32:00	She's in with the Mad-10s.
518	00:32:00	00:32:03	She set her dad up.
519	00:32:06	00:32:07	You set them up!
520	00:32:07	00:32:09	You're gonna get them killed! Bitch!
521	00:32:09	00:32:12	Sanders? Frank really thinks I tried to help him?
522	00:32:12	00:32:14	Where did you send them?
523	00:32:14	00:32:16	If they hurt her, I swear to you...
524	00:32:16	00:32:17	Mad-10s are my family.
525	00:32:17	00:32:18	Frank killed two of us.
526	00:32:18	00:32:20	He has to pay for that.
527	00:32:22	00:32:24	Where did you send them?
528	00:32:24	00:32:26	It's done.
529	00:32:36	00:32:39	Web search didn't find any wishing well in Nevada.
530	00:32:39	00:32:44	Cafferty's not picking up on the radio, so we have no idea if he got any of our warnings.
531	00:32:44	00:32:47	We're gonna have to find this place, so we can get there before Zadian does.
532	00:32:47	00:32:50	Well, Frank and Samantha didn't spend much time together.
533	00:32:50	00:32:53	So if this wishing well is a shared memory, it might be in one of these boxes.
534	00:32:53	00:32:55	It's worth a try.
535	00:33:35	00:33:37	I've got it.
536	00:33:37	00:33:40	All right, it's a park someplace, right?
537	00:33:40	00:33:41	Yeah, I'm not sure where.
538	00:33:41	00:33:42	Wait a second.
539	00:33:42	00:33:43	Look--Look at the clothing.
540	00:33:43	00:33:45	I've seen that before.
541	00:33:45	00:33:48	There's other shots they were wearing that same outfit.
542	00:33:48	00:33:49	I've seen it.
543	00:33:49	00:33:50	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go.
544	00:33:50	00:33:52	What is that?
545	00:33:52	00:33:53	Winston's Wild West Village.
546	00:33:53	00:33:58	That was an old theme park that shut down years ago.
547	00:33:58	00:33:59	(alarm beeping) Hey, we're on fumes, man!
548	00:33:59	00:34:00	What are you looking for?
549	00:34:00	00:34:02	Shut up!
550	00:34:02	00:34:04	There it is. Right there. Take her down now.
551	00:34:08	00:34:09	Wait.
552	00:34:09	00:34:12	Who is that?
553	00:34:12	00:34:14	Cops?!
554	00:34:14	00:34:16	Not cops.
555	00:34:16	00:34:18	Get us out of here.
556	00:34:18	00:34:19	What? Now!
557	00:34:30	00:34:31	That's all she's got!
558	00:35:32	00:35:35	This is Brass.
559	00:35:35	00:35:37	I want the CSIs to keep their distance.
560	00:35:37	00:35:39	I got lead.
561	00:35:39	00:35:40	You got that, Sanders?
562	00:35:40	00:35:42	Copy.
563	00:36:03	00:36:04	Follow me.
564	00:36:04	00:36:05	They're coming.
565	00:36:05	00:36:06	We got to hide.
566	00:36:08	00:36:09	Dude, you've got the gun.
567	00:36:10	00:36:12	Come on.
568	00:36:26	00:36:28	Come on, let's go.
569	00:36:37	00:36:38	This way, come on.
570	00:36:38	00:36:39	All right, all right.
571	00:36:39	00:36:40	I got you. Let's go.
572	00:36:42	00:36:44	Come on.
573	00:36:46	00:36:47	I got you.
574	00:37:14	00:37:15	These guys friends of yours?
575	00:37:15	00:37:18	Probably the same guys who left me for dead last night.
576	00:37:18	00:37:21	Bet you wish they'd finished me off, huh?
577	00:37:21	00:37:23	Bet you wish you were in Cabo right now.
578	00:37:39	00:37:41	How do they know we're here?
579	00:37:47	00:37:48	Samantha.
580	00:37:51	00:37:52	They're in here.
581	00:37:52	00:37:54	Cover the back.
582	00:38:37	00:38:38	Come on, we got to go. I can't.
583	00:38:38	00:38:40	We got to go! I can't!
584	00:38:40	00:38:43	I said, I can't.
585	00:38:49	00:38:53	I'm sorry.
586	00:38:53	00:38:54	I have nothing left.
587	00:38:57	00:39:00	Save yourself, okay?
588	00:39:32	00:39:34	Everything clear outside?
589	00:39:34	00:39:36	Yeah.
590	00:39:38	00:39:40	He's over here.
591	00:40:18	00:40:20	Morgan.
592	00:40:21	00:40:22	Are you hurt?
593	00:40:22	00:40:24	You still owe me one.
594	00:40:24	00:40:26	Morgan.
595	00:40:28	00:40:29	What can I...
596	00:40:29	00:40:31	I'm fine, Dad.
597	00:40:41	00:40:44	I just want to get out of here.
598	00:40:44	00:40:46	Yeah, okay.
599	00:40:46	00:40:47	Can we go?
600	00:40:47	00:40:49	Sure.
601	00:41:10	00:41:13	You're going to be okay.
602	00:41:13	00:41:14	I'm fine.
603	00:41:21	00:41:23	You're going to be okay.
604	00:41:25	00:41:26	You're going to be okay.
