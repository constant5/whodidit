0	00:00:25	00:00:26	Hey, Danny.
1	00:00:31	00:00:32	Thanks.
2	00:01:14	00:01:15	Some night, huh?
3	00:01:16	00:01:17	It's ugly out there.
4	00:02:10	00:02:15	the criminally insane and sexually violent predators, all with multiple convictions.
5	00:02:15	00:02:18	We get all the inmates the prisons can't handle.
6	00:02:18	00:02:22	Keep your kits closed and locked when not in use.
7	00:02:22	00:02:23	Um, Ms. Sidle, best if you remove the vest.
8	00:02:23	00:02:27	New uniforms upset them.
9	00:02:32	00:02:38	We're mostly concerned with maintaining psychiatric remission.
10	00:02:38	00:02:45	We want to stabilize symptoms and reduce an individual's risk of violence to himself and to others.
11	00:02:45	00:02:50	Oh, uh, could actually stop here and put your backs against the wall, please.
12	00:02:50	00:02:52	It's standard safety procedure.
13	00:03:01	00:03:04	Put your tongue in your mouth, Jake.
14	00:03:04	00:03:05	We're moving them all to the Day Room.
15	00:03:12	00:03:13	This is Captain Brass.
16	00:03:14	00:03:18	Dr. Grissom and Ms. Sidle are from the Crime Lab.
17	00:03:18	00:03:19	Lt. Reed Owens, Desert State Hospital Police.
18	00:03:19	00:03:25	We have our own internal police team and Lieutenant Owens was the first officer on the scene after the call came in.
19	00:03:25	00:03:28	The victim was found by Nurse Faber 10 a.m.
20	00:03:28	00:03:31	Joanne was coming off shift, I was coming on.
21	00:03:31	00:03:34	Doing bed checks, I found Robbie on the floor.
22	00:03:34	00:03:37	Kenny was in the corner covered in blood.
23	00:03:37	00:03:39	Are the patients locked in their rooms at night?
24	00:03:39	00:03:41	No. The doors are left unlocked.
25	00:03:41	00:03:44	So they're free to roam around?
26	00:03:44	00:03:48	Locked rooms usually lead to patients trying to harm themselves.
27	00:03:48	00:03:49	Where's Kenny now?
28	00:03:49	00:03:51	He's been taken to seclusion.
29	00:03:55	00:03:58	Shh-shh-shh.
30	00:03:58	00:04:02	Leon, let's get a couple more milligrams of Lorazepam into him.
31	00:04:04	00:04:06	How did he get those wounds?
32	00:04:06	00:04:07	Oh, Kenny's a self-mutilator.
33	00:04:07	00:04:10	He suffers from Renfield's Syndrome; gets off on blood.
34	00:04:10	00:04:11	Shh...
35	00:04:11	00:04:17	Couple of weeks ago I caught him gouging himself with a carpet staple.
36	00:04:17	00:04:20	He was wearing these clothes when you found him?
37	00:04:20	00:04:21	Yes.
38	00:04:27	00:04:30	There was blood spatter all over the victim's room.
39	00:04:31	00:04:33	Blood but no spatter on Kenny's clothes.
40	00:04:33	00:04:35	I'm not sure this is our guy.
41	00:04:35	00:04:38	Locked unit. Finite number of suspects.
42	00:04:41	00:04:45	Crazy or not... here we come.
43	00:05:31	00:05:34	Who's this guy knitting an imaginary sweater?
44	00:05:34	00:05:36	How's he know when it's finished?
45	00:05:36	00:05:38	His brain tells him that what he's doing is real.
46	00:05:38	00:05:40	He has no reason to doubt it.
47	00:05:40	00:05:42	Or any desire to.
48	00:05:42	00:05:46	They asked John Nash how he could believe that extraterrestrials were sending him messages.
49	00:05:46	00:05:52	He said that the messages came to him in the same way that his mathematical ideas did.
50	00:05:52	00:05:54	So he had to take them seriously.
51	00:05:54	00:05:56	Hey. Valerie Dino.
52	00:05:56	00:05:57	I'm the on-call doctor.
53	00:05:58	00:05:59	Did you pronounce?
54	00:05:59	00:06:00	Yeah.
55	00:06:00	00:06:05	The administration asked me to set up some rooms for your interviews, but, uh, personally, I don't see what you hope to accomplish.
56	00:06:05	00:06:08	These patients are criminals with severe mental disorders.
57	00:06:08	00:06:10	They're not going to give you a straight answer.
58	00:06:11	00:06:12	No one ever does.
59	00:07:13	00:07:15	I definitely heard something.
60	00:07:15	00:07:16	He said, I'll get in!
61	00:07:16	00:07:22	No, no, it was, I'm coming in.
62	00:07:22	00:07:23	I heard him say it.
63	00:07:23	00:07:24	And it's not like he isn't serious.
64	00:07:28	00:07:30	Who isn't serious?
65	00:07:30	00:07:32	The, uh, perpetrator.
66	00:07:35	00:07:38	Can you tell me anything else about him?
67	00:07:38	00:07:40	Oh, no, I couldn't.
68	00:07:40	00:07:42	Why not?
69	00:07:42	00:07:44	He's here.
70	00:07:47	00:07:48	In this room?
71	00:07:50	00:07:53	Is his name Ronald?
72	00:07:53	00:07:55	No. My name is Ronald.
73	00:07:56	00:07:57	What's his name?
74	00:07:57	00:07:59	He doesn't have a name.
75	00:07:59	00:08:01	He's a cricket.
76	00:08:01	00:08:03	Here.
77	00:08:03	00:08:04	A cricket?
78	00:08:05	00:08:06	Yes.
79	00:08:06	00:08:09	Trying to burrow a hole in my head.
80	00:08:15	00:08:16	I don't sleep.
81	00:08:18	00:08:20	Never?
82	00:08:23	00:08:25	So what do you do at night?
83	00:08:25	00:08:28	Day, night, it don't make no difference.
84	00:08:28	00:08:29	I think.
85	00:08:32	00:08:33	About what?
86	00:08:35	00:08:36	Bitches.
87	00:09:18	00:09:20	What's so amusing?
88	00:09:20	00:09:25	So let's say you find out who did it, and maybe it's me.
89	00:09:27	00:09:30	What are you going to do?
90	00:09:30	00:09:33	Are you going to convict me of murder and put me in a bad place?
91	00:09:33	00:09:36	Is it you?
92	00:09:36	00:09:37	Check the files, sir.
93	00:09:37	00:09:40	I'm a rapist, not a murderer.
94	00:09:44	00:09:47	Robert Garson?
95	00:09:48	00:09:49	Hmm?
96	00:09:54	00:09:57	Do you know what happened to Robert Garson?
97	00:09:57	00:10:05	Female pig relation hanged, it sped even, well, too.
98	00:10:06	00:10:07	What?
99	00:10:09	00:10:16	No. I ground it... blindly.
100	00:10:16	00:10:17	Wet and dirty.
101	00:10:17	00:10:19	Cut the blood oven.
102	00:10:19	00:10:23	It spoke justly, repeatedly, calmly.
103	00:10:23	00:10:26	Some thin rod dared your wash.
104	00:10:26	00:10:32	They foretold this into some ready child, which fell crossly.
105	00:10:32	00:10:36	They hag-rode me... again.
106	00:10:38	00:10:40	Why are you looking at me?
107	00:10:40	00:10:42	You got Leon, he's a spic.
108	00:10:42	00:10:44	Earl, the brother.
109	00:10:44	00:10:48	And the crazy frickin' jewboy with the bug in his head.
110	00:10:52	00:10:55	You know, most of the doctors here are Jewish.
111	00:10:55	00:10:57	They're the ones with the access.
112	00:11:03	00:11:04	Yeah?
113	00:11:05	00:11:07	Dr. Dino.
114	00:11:07	00:11:08	Hi.
115	00:11:08	00:11:11	Paperwork.
116	00:11:11	00:11:13	This is a state-run facility.
117	00:11:13	00:11:14	What can I help you with?
118	00:11:14	00:11:17	Question about the victim.
119	00:11:17	00:11:24	I have heard that in some cases of deviant sexual predisposition, you slow the sex drive...
120	00:11:24	00:11:28	If you're talking about chemical castration, the answer is, yes, Robbie was.
121	00:11:28	00:11:31	So he didn't masturbate.
122	00:11:31	00:11:32	Masturbate, yes.
123	00:11:32	00:11:34	Ejaculate, no.
124	00:11:34	00:11:37	So the semen that I found on his bed is someone else's?
125	00:11:37	00:11:39	Likely.
126	00:11:39	00:11:41	Thanks.
127	00:11:41	00:11:43	Sure.
128	00:11:43	00:11:48	Hey, guys, I found semen in the victim's room and it's probably not his.
129	00:11:48	00:11:50	He was chemically castrated.
130	00:11:50	00:11:53	So you're thinking the donor could be the killer?
131	00:11:53	00:11:58	Sex is the foreplay. Violence is the climax.
132	00:11:59	00:12:01	Well... happy swabbing.
133	00:12:03	00:12:04	They've been prepped.
134	00:12:05	00:12:07	You're all set.
135	00:12:07	00:12:08	Thank you, Lieutenant.
136	00:12:08	00:12:10	Here you go, padre.
137	00:12:10	00:12:12	Wash your worries away.
138	00:12:12	00:12:14	Thank you.
139	00:12:16	00:12:18	Well, you take that side.
140	00:12:21	00:12:22	I'll take Jiminy Cricket.
141	00:12:22	00:12:24	Excellent.
142	00:12:31	00:12:32	Say ah.
143	00:12:32	00:12:33	Ah.
144	00:12:35	00:12:36	Thank you.
145	00:12:40	00:12:42	Say ah.
146	00:12:46	00:12:47	You, too, Leon.
147	00:12:47	00:12:48	I work here.
148	00:12:48	00:12:50	Exactly.
149	00:12:53	00:12:54	Open your mouth, please.
150	00:12:56	00:12:57	Would you open your mouth, sir?
151	00:13:02	00:13:05	Grissom...
152	00:13:05	00:13:07	you take this one.
153	00:13:14	00:13:16	Let's start with the stomach contents.
154	00:13:16	00:13:18	They're fascinating.
155	00:13:18	00:13:22	It reminded me of that scene in Jaws where Dreyfuss cuts open the shark's belly and all kinds of weird things come out.
156	00:13:22	00:13:25	You find a license plate?
157	00:13:25	00:13:27	Not quite.
158	00:13:27	00:13:32	Highlights include Band-Aids, wood chips, hair and half a snapshot.
159	00:13:32	00:13:34	Pica?
160	00:13:34	00:13:35	Boo?
161	00:13:37	00:13:41	Pica is a compulsion to eat non-nutritive food items.
162	00:13:41	00:13:45	It's from the Latin word for magpie, a bird with a large and indiscriminate appetite.
163	00:13:45	00:13:51	Trichotillomania would explain the pulling out and eating of hair.
164	00:13:51	00:13:53	Another OCD disorder.
165	00:13:53	00:13:56	I sent hair and blood samples to Tox.
166	00:13:56	00:13:58	Stellate lacerations.
167	00:13:58	00:14:01	Linear skull fracture extending into the calvarium.
168	00:14:01	00:14:04	And contre-coup contusions to the frontal and temporal lobes.
169	00:14:04	00:14:07	So C.O.D. was blunt force trauma?
170	00:14:07	00:14:08	No. Asphyxiation.
171	00:14:08	00:14:10	During the struggle?
172	00:14:10	00:14:17	No. Coagulation of the blood tells me that the head trauma was post-mortem, at least two hours after he was suffocated.
173	00:14:17	00:14:20	So evidently dead wasn't dead enough.
174	00:14:20	00:14:26	I also found ligature marks on the wrists and ankles.
175	00:14:26	00:14:29	They showed up during the Y, peri-mortem.
176	00:14:29	00:14:32	So, what, tortured? Tied up?
177	00:14:32	00:14:34	Restrained.
178	00:14:39	00:14:41	Nobody mentioned restraints.
179	00:14:45	00:14:47	Would you ever bleach your hair?
180	00:14:47	00:14:48	I wouldn't.
181	00:14:48	00:14:50	It's so Greg Sanders.
182	00:14:50	00:14:55	Most of the hair is the vic's, but I also found that bleached sample as well.
183	00:14:55	00:15:00	In my continuing quest to further my standing, I took it upon myself to get you the tox report.
184	00:15:00	00:15:01	Thanks. You're welcome.
185	00:15:01	00:15:04	Blood came back with pretty hefty levels of Olanzapine.
186	00:15:04	00:15:06	That's a potent anti-psychotic.
187	00:15:06	00:15:07	Good for drooling.
188	00:15:07	00:15:12	And also there's the, uh, not so potent smattering of Ibuprofen.
189	00:15:12	00:15:13	That's it? That's it.
190	00:15:14	00:15:19	If I were institutionalized, I think I would hope for something better.
191	00:15:19	00:15:21	Clonazepam, maybe.
192	00:15:21	00:15:24	What, you, uh, think I'm crazy?
193	00:15:24	00:15:26	Crazy is as crazy does.
194	00:15:26	00:15:30	His chart indicated at least four other anti-psychotics.
195	00:15:30	00:15:32	Why wasn't he getting those meds?
196	00:15:32	00:15:35	Do I look clairvoyant?
197	00:15:35	00:15:37	News flash from the loony bin.
198	00:15:37	00:15:43	Two reported deaths in the last three years from complications due to restraint procedures.
199	00:15:43	00:15:45	And how many have gone unreported?
200	00:15:45	00:15:47	The hospital just got off probation.
201	00:15:47	00:15:49	One more death by restraint brings the Feds in.
202	00:15:49	00:15:51	Good incentive to keep it quiet.
203	00:15:51	00:15:53	Or make it look like someone else did it.
204	00:15:53	00:15:56	Yeah. Somebody who's crazy.
205	00:15:56	00:15:58	We're legally required to tape all our sessions.
206	00:15:58	00:16:03	This is Robbie in the seclusion room the day he died.
207	00:16:13	00:16:17	As you can see, the on-call doctor and Nurse Mckay checked in on him.
208	00:16:19	00:16:24	Two hours later, he was escorted out, so I resent the accusation.
209	00:16:24	00:16:27	We've made a lot of changes.
210	00:16:27	00:16:30	Policy, staff, surveillance have all been overhauled.
211	00:16:30	00:16:34	Look, Robbie left the seclusion room alive.
212	00:16:34	00:16:35	Okay, fine.
213	00:16:35	00:16:37	Who administers medication?
214	00:16:37	00:16:38	Uh, the nurses, psych techs.
215	00:16:39	00:16:40	Why is this important?
216	00:16:40	00:16:44	Well, according to his tox results, Robbie's system was short four anti-psychotics.
217	00:16:44	00:16:46	Maybe he was cheeking them.
218	00:16:56	00:16:57	Why would he do that?
219	00:16:57	00:16:59	They think they don't need 'em.
220	00:16:59	00:17:00	They sell 'em, trade 'em or...
221	00:17:00	00:17:02	store them up, get high later.
222	00:17:02	00:17:05	We're gonna need to talk to his pharmacist.
223	00:17:06	00:17:08	Who's next? Oh, come on, Earl.
224	00:17:08	00:17:09	There you go.
225	00:17:12	00:17:15	Hey, you know I'm gonna bust your ass on the court, right?
226	00:17:15	00:17:17	You better bring your 'A' game next time.
227	00:17:17	00:17:19	Come on, Chuck, I got something for you.
228	00:17:28	00:17:30	Love your hair, Leon.
229	00:17:30	00:17:31	Thanks.
230	00:17:31	00:17:33	What do you got here?
231	00:17:33	00:17:37	Ibuprofen, laxative, aspirin.
232	00:17:37	00:17:41	What are you treating exactly, schizophrenia or constipation?
233	00:17:41	00:17:43	Where are the real drugs, Leon?
234	00:17:48	00:18:01	Man... Xanax, Lanzopine, Zoloft, Suprazadone, Clozapine, Loranzapan, lithium, Valium, Wellbutrin, Haldol, Respiredone.
235	00:18:01	00:18:04	You took everything with street value.
236	00:18:04	00:18:06	Look, dude...
237	00:18:06	00:18:08	I get 22K a year.
238	00:18:08	00:18:09	That's nothing.
239	00:18:09	00:18:11	Diddly-squat.
240	00:18:11	00:18:13	I should get hazard pay.
241	00:18:13	00:18:15	These people, I get...
242	00:18:15	00:18:17	I get spit on, puked on, peed on, bitten.
243	00:18:17	00:18:22	I get my hair yanked out, I get my ass pinched, I get... I get death threats.
244	00:18:22	00:18:24	All for 22K.
245	00:18:24	00:18:26	So I supplement my income.
246	00:18:26	00:18:28	It don't hurt nobody.
247	00:18:28	00:18:30	Are you a doctor?
248	00:18:30	00:18:34	Look, these places, they overmedicate all the time.
249	00:18:34	00:18:36	It controls the population.
250	00:18:36	00:18:39	And I don't endanger the patients, okay?
251	00:18:39	00:18:41	I-I'm all about the patients.
252	00:18:41	00:18:45	Maybe Robbie caught you skimping on his meds, threatened to blow the whistle.
253	00:18:45	00:18:46	There goes that supplemental income.
254	00:18:49	00:18:51	I see what you're doing.
255	00:18:51	00:18:54	I'm reporting you. You're stealing.
256	00:18:54	00:18:55	Robbie, hold on a second, will you?
257	00:19:01	00:19:05	All right, here you go, here you go, here you go.
258	00:19:13	00:19:15	No. All right, no way, man.
259	00:19:15	00:19:17	That's a story.
260	00:19:17	00:19:19	'Kay? That's not why he went to seclusion.
261	00:19:19	00:19:21	Why did he go to seclusion?
262	00:19:21	00:19:22	He freaked out in group.
263	00:19:23	00:19:24	I wasn't even there.
264	00:19:24	00:19:26	Ask somebody who was.
265	00:19:27	00:19:29	Am I gonna lose my job?
266	00:19:29	00:19:32	'Cause these people...
267	00:19:32	00:19:34	need me.
268	00:19:34	00:19:39	According to the video logs, 03 p.m.
269	00:19:39	00:19:41	06 p.m.
270	00:19:41	00:19:47	Nurse Mckay noted that he was awake and in bed 30 p.m. bed-checks.
271	00:19:48	00:19:51	10.
272	00:19:51	00:19:54	30 and midnight, he was suffocated.
273	00:19:54	00:19:56	30.
274	00:19:56	00:20:00	The blood would've needed time to coagulate before his head was smashed in.
275	00:20:00	00:20:03	And not necessarily by the same person.
276	00:20:03	00:20:05	Hey, how about some pillow talk?
277	00:20:05	00:20:07	Robbie's pillow had saliva on it.
278	00:20:07	00:20:09	Lots of it; all his.
279	00:20:09	00:20:10	Could be from drooling.
280	00:20:11	00:20:13	Or it could be from dying.
281	00:20:13	00:20:17	Well, look at this-- I found slits at both ends.
282	00:20:17	00:20:18	Left hand...
283	00:20:18	00:20:20	and right hand.
284	00:20:23	00:20:25	Looks like we have a murder weapon.
285	00:20:26	00:20:31	All past-level-three patients, please return to your unit for a head count.
286	00:20:33	00:20:36	All past-level-three patients, please return to your unit...
287	00:20:36	00:20:38	Thanks, Officer.
288	00:20:38	00:20:40	Nurse Mckay, hi.
289	00:20:40	00:20:44	Dr. Dino said that you supervised group therapy yesterday.
290	00:20:45	00:20:49	Uh, yeah. I heard there was an incident involving Robbie.
291	00:20:49	00:20:51	He had a personal item.
292	00:20:51	00:20:53	A personal item?
293	00:20:53	00:20:57	You can't bring anything in group except a beverage.
294	00:20:57	00:20:59	It distracts the other patients.
295	00:20:59	00:21:00	What did he bring?
296	00:21:00	00:21:02	A photograph.
297	00:21:02	00:21:04	Of what?
298	00:21:04	00:21:07	A little boy.
299	00:21:08	00:21:10	What did you do?
300	00:21:10	00:21:13	I followed protocol.
301	00:21:13	00:21:14	Anybody else have anything they want to talk about?
302	00:21:14	00:21:17	I wanna know why everybody's always staring at me-- especially him.
303	00:21:17	00:21:19	He's staring at me.
304	00:21:19	00:21:21	I'm not staring at... Hang on, hang on.
305	00:21:21	00:21:22	Robbie?
306	00:21:23	00:21:26	What have you got there? Nothing.
307	00:21:26	00:21:27	Fag candy.
308	00:21:27	00:21:28	Well, what's the rule?
309	00:21:28	00:21:30	There's no personal items...
310	00:21:30	00:21:31	No!
311	00:21:31	00:21:32	Give me the... No!
312	00:21:32	00:21:33	No! Don't touch me!
313	00:21:36	00:21:39	medication, seclusion, restraint.
314	00:21:39	00:21:43	Tough love. Call it what you want-- these aren't my children.
315	00:21:43	00:21:46	Why didn't you mention this information last night?
316	00:21:46	00:21:49	Because crap like that happens every day here.
317	00:21:50	00:21:53	I should get back to the unit. Sure.
318	00:21:56	00:21:58	Sidle.
319	00:21:58	00:22:01	We got the DNA results back on the semen on Robbie's sheets.
320	00:22:01	00:22:04	Patient Adam Trent-- the nail biter.
321	00:22:04	00:22:05	Okay.
322	00:22:13	00:22:15	This stuff is dark.
323	00:22:15	00:22:17	Yeah.
324	00:22:17	00:22:21	'Course, I wouldn't expect Winnie the Pooh.
325	00:22:23	00:22:25	Adam's subconscious was working overtime.
326	00:22:25	00:22:29	I bet you aced your Rorschachs.
327	00:22:29	00:22:34	When I was in fifth grade, I drew a picture of a harpooned whale.
328	00:22:34	00:22:36	Everyone thought I was gonzo'd.
329	00:22:36	00:22:38	But I had just read Moby Dick.
330	00:22:39	00:22:43	Sometimes a dying whale is just a dying whale.
331	00:23:23	00:23:25	These are all postdated over a year ago.
332	00:23:30	00:23:31	It's not just his subconscious.
333	00:23:31	00:23:33	This guy's got stuff buried everywhere.
334	00:23:37	00:23:40	Dearest Angel, I think of you wherever I go.
335	00:23:40	00:23:42	You are my prince. I miss you.
336	00:23:42	00:23:44	Write to me. Your only love, Mother.
337	00:23:44	00:23:46	Another one.
338	00:23:46	00:23:48	Uh... It rained today.
339	00:23:48	00:23:51	I thought of that time when you and I got caught in the storm at the lake.
340	00:23:51	00:23:54	The fire... I came home and made your favorite dinner.
341	00:23:54	00:23:55	I even set a place for you...
342	00:23:55	00:23:57	So on and so forth.
343	00:23:57	00:23:59	That does not sound maternal to me.
344	00:23:59	00:24:01	It's not.
345	00:24:01	00:24:02	Incest?
346	00:24:02	00:24:03	Fully consummated.
347	00:24:03	00:24:07	Mother-son incest is rare and deeply pathological.
348	00:24:07	00:24:09	Oedipal complex taken too far?
349	00:24:09	00:24:10	Oedipus...
350	00:24:10	00:24:11	implies son to mother.
351	00:24:11	00:24:15	In this case, the mother was seeking the love and creating the codependence.
352	00:24:15	00:24:17	We call this a Jocasta complex.
353	00:24:17	00:24:19	Oedipus' mother.
354	00:24:19	00:24:22	When Adam was nine his father died.
355	00:24:22	00:24:24	His mother replaced her dead husband with her son.
356	00:24:25	00:24:26	That's got to mess you up.
357	00:24:26	00:24:32	Yeah. Adam is schizo-affective, suicidal, and a pathological narcissist.
358	00:24:32	00:24:41	When he was a teenager he was unable to retaliate against his mother and incapable of actual intimacy, so... he started raping woman.
359	00:24:41	00:24:43	Always women?
360	00:24:43	00:24:46	Yes. Which is why I don't think he killed Robbie.
361	00:24:46	00:24:48	We found Adam's semen in Robbie's bed.
362	00:24:48	00:24:50	You see, that surprises me.
363	00:24:50	00:24:54	Like any good psychopath, he rarely veers from his pattern.
364	00:24:54	00:24:58	Adam is a single-celled organism who exists wholly for himself.
365	00:25:00	00:25:02	He must've been getting something tangible in return.
366	00:25:02	00:25:03	What?
367	00:25:03	00:25:06	Drugs? Cigarettes?
368	00:25:06	00:25:07	Drugs aren't his issue.
369	00:25:07	00:25:10	And as far as I know he doesn't smoke. Um...
370	00:25:10	00:25:12	So, uh, what can we learn from his art work?
371	00:25:12	00:25:22	Uh... He starts with an innocuous object; a tree, a cat, an oboe-- all of which he morphs into something deadly. You can see...
372	00:25:23	00:25:25	all of them.
373	00:25:25	00:25:29	So what should be safe turns into something unsafe.
374	00:25:29	00:25:31	Mother becomes lover.
375	00:25:31	00:25:32	What about the mother?
376	00:25:32	00:25:34	Do you have any idea where she is?
377	00:25:34	00:25:36	She lives near Reno.
378	00:25:36	00:25:39	Based on the postmarks, it seems like she stopped writing him.
379	00:25:40	00:25:45	Every time a letter came a manic episode followed, then a severe depression, including one suicide attempt.
380	00:25:45	00:25:51	So I started sending the letters back.
381	00:25:51	00:25:53	Eventually, she stopped writing.
382	00:26:00	00:26:03	Did I kill him?
383	00:26:03	00:26:06	Yes.
384	00:26:06	00:26:07	Why?
385	00:26:07	00:26:10	He was queer.
386	00:26:10	00:26:12	But you had sex with him.
387	00:26:15	00:26:17	No.
388	00:26:17	00:26:19	He had sex with me.
389	00:26:19	00:26:21	He was the punk.
390	00:26:21	00:26:24	Was it consensual?
391	00:26:24	00:26:26	I don't know.
392	00:26:26	00:26:28	So why did you do it?
393	00:26:28	00:26:31	I don't know.
394	00:26:31	00:26:33	Okay.
395	00:26:34	00:26:36	So then what happened?
396	00:26:36	00:26:38	I took his head and I smashed it into the floor.
397	00:26:41	00:26:44	And that's how you killed him?
398	00:26:48	00:26:50	What? You don't believe me?
399	00:26:50	00:26:52	I'm just wondering if that's how you killed him.
400	00:26:52	00:26:54	Yes. I'm saying this and this is true.
401	00:26:54	00:26:59	And if you don't believe me, just look in the bucket in the latrine.
402	00:26:59	00:27:00	Okay...
403	00:27:01	00:27:05	Do you really want to know why I killed him?
404	00:27:05	00:27:06	Yes.
405	00:27:13	00:27:16	It's because I'm crazy.
406	00:27:22	00:27:25	Not a word about suffocation.
407	00:27:25	00:27:28	Well, his nails weren't long enough to leave those tears in the pillow.
408	00:27:28	00:27:30	And there would have been traces of blood from his cuticles.
409	00:27:30	00:27:32	Something is off.
410	00:27:53	00:27:56	Here's the blood splatter we've been looking for.
411	00:28:03	00:28:05	What is that on the crotch?
412	00:28:07	00:28:09	Lipstick.
413	00:28:20	00:28:21	Where is Nurse Mckay?
414	00:28:21	00:28:23	I need to talk to her.
415	00:28:23	00:28:25	She's on lunch duty.
416	00:28:25	00:28:32	All right. I can either take this and the underwear back to the lab and confirm the match, which will only extend our presence here.
417	00:28:32	00:28:34	Or...
418	00:28:34	00:28:37	you can give me access to the nurse's station right now.
419	00:28:40	00:28:43	Dr. Walsh, please call your service.
420	00:28:43	00:28:45	Dr. Walsh, call your service, stat.
421	00:28:45	00:28:50	This must be the photo that Nurse Mckay confiscated from Robbie in group.
422	00:28:50	00:28:52	The missing half?
423	00:28:52	00:28:56	I found blue tape in Robbie's room.
424	00:28:56	00:28:58	Kind of looks like Adam.
425	00:28:58	00:29:00	Where would Robbie get a picture of Adam?
426	00:29:00	00:29:03	Well, they were having sex.
427	00:29:12	00:29:14	I'm going to find someone who can open these drawers.
428	00:29:14	00:29:16	Okay.
429	00:29:16	00:29:20	Dr. Stoon, please pick up the white telephone.
430	00:29:20	00:29:23	Dr. Stoon, call on the white telephone.
431	00:29:38	00:29:40	Hey.
432	00:29:47	00:29:49	Are you a spiritual person?
433	00:29:49	00:29:52	Sometimes.
434	00:29:52	00:29:56	Do you believe that everything happens for a reason?
435	00:29:56	00:29:59	That bad things are there to teach us a karmic lesson?
436	00:29:59	00:30:04	You know, maybe all our problems can be cured by tuning in to a higher frequency.
437	00:30:04	00:30:14	There's this one guy I read, he believes that illness, anxiety and fear all occur when people are vibrating at 10,000 cycles a second.
438	00:30:23	00:30:32	If they could just get up to 100,000 cycles per second they'd be in the realm of sound, light and spirit, and everything would be just fine. Right?
439	00:30:32	00:30:33	Yeah.
440	00:30:33	00:30:34	You know what I think?
441	00:30:34	00:30:38	I think I'm just vibrating at the wrong frequency.
442	00:30:38	00:30:39	It's okay.
443	00:30:39	00:30:42	Do you think I'm smart?
444	00:30:42	00:30:43	Yeah. Yeah?
445	00:30:43	00:30:44	Uh-huh.
446	00:30:44	00:30:46	Do you think I'm right?
447	00:30:46	00:30:47	I do. Open the door.
448	00:30:47	00:30:49	I can't. I don't have my keys to open the door.
449	00:30:49	00:30:51	Don't you move.
450	00:30:51	00:30:52	Please open the door.
451	00:30:52	00:30:54	You move a muscle I will grind you, bitch.
452	00:30:55	00:30:55	You hear me?
453	00:30:55	00:30:56	Do not look at them.
454	00:30:56	00:30:57	Keep your eyes on the floor.
455	00:30:58	00:31:01	You! You, go away! You! You, go away!
456	00:31:01	00:31:02	No!
457	00:31:04	00:31:05	Adam, stop!
458	00:31:06	00:31:08	Get a medic in here!
459	00:31:08	00:31:09	Hold still.
460	00:31:09	00:31:10	Apple pressure!
461	00:31:10	00:31:14	Where is he? Where is he?
462	00:31:15	00:31:17	We need some help in here!
463	00:31:29	00:31:34	When my father died, my mother came to a place like this for awhile for evaluation.
464	00:31:36	00:31:40	It looked the same, it smelled the same.
465	00:31:40	00:31:41	It smelled like lies.
466	00:31:43	00:31:45	You sure you're okay?
467	00:31:45	00:31:49	Crazy people do make me feel crazy.
468	00:31:50	00:31:54	If you want, I can have somebody take your place.
469	00:31:54	00:31:57	I appreciate that.
470	00:31:57	00:32:00	I do, I really do, but...
471	00:32:02	00:32:07	I kind of made a decision to move beyond that and...
472	00:32:07	00:32:09	I really want to finish this case.
473	00:32:09	00:32:10	We have rules for a reason.
474	00:32:10	00:32:12	You people come in here disrupting things.
475	00:32:12	00:32:15	You're unsafe. This is your fault.
476	00:32:15	00:32:16	Really?
477	00:32:17	00:32:19	You seem to take your job rather personally.
478	00:32:19	00:32:20	What are you suggesting?
479	00:32:20	00:32:23	That you had an intimate relationship with Adam Trent.
480	00:32:23	00:32:25	That's ridiculous.
481	00:32:25	00:32:26	Your lipstick is on his underwear.
482	00:32:27	00:32:28	I gave Robbie my lipstick sometimes.
483	00:32:28	00:32:29	Maybe he was wearing it when...
484	00:32:29	00:32:31	We didn't find any on his lips.
485	00:32:31	00:32:36	Well, that's your problem.
486	00:32:36	00:32:37	What are you waiting for?
487	00:32:37	00:32:40	Get him to the medical unit, stat.
488	00:33:10	00:33:13	Excuse me.
489	00:33:14	00:33:16	Adam Trent was working on this piece?
490	00:33:17	00:33:18	Yes.
491	00:33:18	00:33:20	He made it on Monday.
492	00:33:20	00:33:23	But he never got a chance to fire it.
493	00:33:23	00:33:27	Nurse Mckay came in, they had a conversation.
494	00:33:27	00:33:31	Actually, it was more of an argument, very heated, very loud.
495	00:33:38	00:33:41	And then she yanked him out of class.
496	00:33:41	00:33:43	Was this on the wheel while they were arguing?
497	00:33:43	00:33:45	Yeah.
498	00:33:48	00:33:50	Adam's work is very provocative.
499	00:33:50	00:33:52	Yeah.
500	00:33:52	00:33:55	It speaks to me.
501	00:33:55	00:33:57	Acoustic Archeology?
502	00:33:57	00:34:01	In the '60s, experiments were done on clay pots and painted canvas.
503	00:34:01	00:34:07	Scientists were able to ferret out sounds that were captured during the creative process in the clay and the paint.
504	00:34:07	00:34:08	Trippy.
505	00:34:08	00:34:11	It's actually not that out there.
506	00:34:11	00:34:19	In the old days, the first gramophone recordings were made by taking the vibrations of sound and cutting them into wax cylinders while they were turning.
507	00:34:22	00:34:29	Based on the frequency and intensity of the sound, the stylus cut into the wax, creating distinct variances of depth and width.
508	00:34:32	00:34:41	For playback, a mechanical transducer vibrated along a groove, generating a current which, when amplified, turned into sound.
509	00:34:41	00:34:48	When the art therapist told me that there'd been an argument while Adam was on the wheel, I thought well, maybe we can pull some sound off his pot.
510	00:34:48	00:34:50	Doppler laser.
511	00:34:50	00:34:51	Optical transducer.
512	00:34:51	00:34:53	We've come a long way.
513	00:34:53	00:34:54	Baby.
514	00:34:58	00:35:01	Well, there's something there.
515	00:35:03	00:35:05	And it sounds like...
516	00:35:06	00:35:08	this.
517	00:35:10	00:35:11	It's lousy signal-to-noise.
518	00:35:11	00:35:14	It's going to need a lot of processing.
519	00:35:26	00:35:27	Speech elements skew to consonants.
520	00:35:28	00:35:30	I'll try and dig them out.
521	00:35:38	00:35:42	Rrr-bee... Rrr-bee...
522	00:35:42	00:35:43	Robbie?
523	00:35:44	00:35:45	Maybe.
524	00:35:45	00:35:48	Could you run that back a little bit?
525	00:35:48	00:35:49	Sure.
526	00:35:51	00:35:52	What is that?
527	00:35:55	00:35:56	Right there.
528	00:35:57	00:36:00	Nnn-gl. Nnn-gl...
529	00:36:00	00:36:02	Angle?
530	00:36:02	00:36:03	Angel.
531	00:36:03	00:36:05	...my angel.
532	00:36:05	00:36:07	My angel. My angel.
533	00:36:09	00:36:13	In her letters, Adam's mother called him angel.
534	00:36:18	00:36:22	The hair from the brush in Adam's room was fresh enough to get a DNA profile.
535	00:36:22	00:36:23	It came back female.
536	00:36:24	00:36:26	We tested it against your cigarette butt.
537	00:36:26	00:36:28	It matched.
538	00:36:28	00:36:30	Adam liked it when I brushed his hair.
539	00:36:30	00:36:32	I bet he did.
540	00:36:32	00:36:36	You were lying about giving Robbie lipstick.
541	00:36:36	00:36:44	You have seven out of 13 alleles in common with your patient, Adam Trent.
542	00:36:44	00:36:47	Your dearest angel.
543	00:36:47	00:36:49	Okay.
544	00:36:49	00:36:53	Joanne Mckay, registered nurse, licensed by the Nevada Board of Nursing 1978.
545	00:36:53	00:36:56	Married Howard Trent 1980.
546	00:36:56	00:37:00	The board requires you to get a new certificate when you get married.
547	00:37:00	00:37:01	I guess you never complied.
548	00:37:01	00:37:03	I've always gone by my maiden name.
549	00:37:03	00:37:07	I guess that makes it less embarrassing to check into the motel with your son.
550	00:37:09	00:37:10	Oh, I'm sorry.
551	00:37:10	00:37:12	You checked into a psycho ward instead.
552	00:37:12	00:37:13	My son needed me.
553	00:37:14	00:37:15	For what?
554	00:37:15	00:37:17	To destroy his ego?
555	00:37:17	00:37:19	To fill him with guilt?
556	00:37:19	00:37:24	To make him hate himself so much he would take his own life just to be free of you?
557	00:37:24	00:37:28	You have no idea what goes on between us.
558	00:37:28	00:37:30	Let's cut the umbilical cord, okay?
559	00:37:30	00:37:33	Six months ago your letters started to come back.
560	00:37:33	00:37:36	No more communication with little Lord Fauntleroy.
561	00:37:36	00:37:38	So you apply to Desert State.
562	00:37:38	00:37:41	They were desperate for nursing staff, so you got a job.
563	00:37:41	00:37:44	Gentlemen, this is our new nurse, Nurse Mckay.
564	00:37:44	00:37:49	Hello.
565	00:37:49	00:37:53	Bet it's tough to turn a folie á deux into a menage á trois.
566	00:37:53	00:37:55	N'est-ce pas?
567	00:38:00	00:38:04	Even tougher that your son was cheating on you...
568	00:38:04	00:38:07	with a man no less.
569	00:38:12	00:38:14	You need to stop this.
570	00:38:14	00:38:16	Stop what?
571	00:38:16	00:38:18	End it with Robbie.
572	00:38:18	00:38:20	Don't tell me what to do.
573	00:38:20	00:38:22	End it or I will.
574	00:38:23	00:38:25	But he didn't end it, did he?
575	00:38:25	00:38:28	Robbie was lover's leverage.
576	00:38:28	00:38:34	He was that thing that Adam kept in his back pocket and pull out whenever he needed to distance himself from you.
577	00:38:34	00:38:37	So you had no choice but to get rid of Robbie.
578	00:38:37	00:38:40	And being a good nurse, you knew his trigger.
579	00:38:43	00:38:46	I want you to talk about this in group today.
580	00:38:46	00:38:47	B-But I thought that we...
581	00:38:47	00:38:48	It's okay. You can bring it.
582	00:38:50	00:38:52	Hey! Robbie.
583	00:38:53	00:38:54	What do you got there?
584	00:38:55	00:38:57	There's no personal items in group.
585	00:38:57	00:38:58	B-But y-you... you told me...
586	00:38:58	00:38:59	that I could bring this.
587	00:38:59	00:39:01	I didn't say anything. Give me that.
588	00:39:01	00:39:02	What is that, a picture?
589	00:39:02	00:39:04	You remember? Give me the picture.
590	00:39:04	00:39:05	No, do you remember?
591	00:39:05	00:39:06	You remember? No! Give me the picture.
592	00:39:06	00:39:07	No, you don't tell me!
593	00:39:07	00:39:08	You told me...!
594	00:39:08	00:39:10	( yelling ) Hang on!
595	00:39:23	00:39:28	You manipulated the situation and took advantage of his weakness.
596	00:39:28	00:39:32	Exactly what you have been doing to Adam for the past 20 years.
597	00:39:32	00:39:37	And being such a good mother, you made him cover it up.
598	00:39:37	00:39:39	Again.
599	00:39:58	00:40:01	Why would my son do that?
600	00:40:01	00:40:04	Because he loves you as much as he hates you.
601	00:40:07	00:40:09	You can't prove any of this.
602	00:40:09	00:40:12	Just the incest, which is a Class B felony.
603	00:40:12	00:40:14	It carries a penalty of up to ten years.
604	00:40:14	00:40:17	That's ten years away from Adam.
605	00:40:17	00:40:21	Good luck getting him to testify.
606	00:40:25	00:40:27	Okay.
607	00:40:37	00:40:41	Well, jail or no jail, I don't think she'll last six months.
608	00:40:41	00:40:45	She'll die without her son.
609	00:40:45	00:40:49	That would be better for both of them.
