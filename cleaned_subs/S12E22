0	00:00:05	00:00:07	That's it?
1	00:00:07	00:00:09	All right, I'll take it from here.
2	00:00:09	00:00:11	Okay, Grandpa. Okay.
3	00:00:11	00:00:13	Time for bed, Katie.
4	00:00:13	00:00:15	Mommy, I'm not tired. Boy, I am.
5	00:00:15	00:00:17	You need to listen to your mommy, Kaitlyn.
6	00:00:17	00:00:20	We're gonna have lots of fun while you're here.
7	00:00:20	00:00:22	So you got to get lots of rest.
8	00:00:22	00:00:24	And that goes for your grandpa, too.
9	00:00:24	00:00:25	What? Yes.
10	00:00:25	00:00:27	Yes, definitely.
11	00:00:27	00:00:29	Grandma's the boss; you know that.
12	00:00:29	00:00:34	And we're gonna have so much fun, we're gonna go to the lake, we're gonna see puppets, we're gonna go to the museums.
13	00:00:34	00:00:35	Ice cream?
14	00:00:35	00:00:37	Ice cream, yes. Tons of ice cream.
15	00:00:37	00:00:38	Thanks, Dad.
16	00:00:38	00:00:40	Emergency numbers are on the fridge.
17	00:00:40	00:00:41	And we're not gonna be that late.
18	00:00:41	00:00:42	Okay. Right?
19	00:00:42	00:00:44	Right.
20	00:00:44	00:00:50	I came to this town with five bucks in my pocket and big dreams.
21	00:00:50	00:00:52	Las Vegas was different back then.
22	00:00:52	00:00:56	It was all about the hustle, all about scoring and moving on.
23	00:00:56	00:00:59	And some guys did that. But me...
24	00:00:59	00:01:03	I planted my roots right here in the desert.
25	00:01:03	00:01:06	I got married, had kids, got married again...
26	00:01:09	00:01:11	Olivia, Conrad, I-I didn't know you guys were...
27	00:01:11	00:01:13	No, Olivia and I...
28	00:01:13	00:01:14	we're just friends.
29	00:01:14	00:01:15	Good friends. Right.
30	00:01:15	00:01:17	Like us.
31	00:01:17	00:01:18	Not quite. More champagne?
32	00:01:18	00:01:19	Yes. Mother?
33	00:01:19	00:01:23	Nice to see you, Barbara.
34	00:01:23	00:01:26	You, too. I know you're usually his date at these functions.
35	00:01:26	00:01:29	Yeah, but people started to talk.
36	00:01:29	00:01:32	Well, uh, so much for the Russell family mantra, huh?
37	00:01:32	00:01:35	Separation of home and work? Well, no, it's still in effect.
38	00:01:35	00:01:36	I'm pretending I'm not here.
39	00:01:36	00:01:46	Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my good friend, the current and future Sheriff of Las Vegas, Sheriff Liston!
40	00:01:49	00:01:50	Didn't like the speech?
41	00:01:50	00:01:52	No, guy giving it.
42	00:01:52	00:01:55	Gilmore loves playing the self-made man.
43	00:01:55	00:01:58	Truth is, he started his empire running a sports book for made men.
44	00:01:58	00:02:01	Well, it looks like he cleaned up his act, then?
45	00:02:01	00:02:02	So he says.
46	00:02:02	00:02:04	Undersheriff, it's good to see you here tonight.
47	00:02:04	00:02:07	You remember David Winnock, my money man, right?
48	00:02:07	00:02:10	Putting together fundraising for the Vegas Silver Strikes' new arena.
49	00:02:10	00:02:11	Oh, yeah. What can I say, you know?
50	00:02:11	00:02:16	Ex-hockey player; I love my hockey team. Well, that project's not approved yet, Jack, you know that.
51	00:02:16	00:02:19	Yeah, well, the city has their time line, I got mine.
52	00:02:19	00:02:21	Speaking of which, I see Councilman Romano.
53	00:02:21	00:02:24	Hey, enjoy the free drinks, guys.
54	00:02:24	00:02:30	Since I took office four years ago, crime in Las Vegas is down!
55	00:02:30	00:02:33	Allow me to share a few stats with you.
56	00:02:35	00:02:38	In the past four years...
57	00:02:38	00:02:42	(applause) prostitution is down by 32%.
58	00:02:42	00:02:48	Drug offenses-- all are down by more than 40%!
59	00:02:48	00:02:53	In the past four years, murder down 28%.
60	00:02:53	00:02:57	Assault down 35%.
61	00:02:57	00:02:58	Rape down 48%.
62	00:02:59	00:03:03	The numbers are good, but they can be better.
63	00:03:03	00:03:05	I ask you all tonight...
64	00:03:05	00:03:12	for yourselves, for your families, for Las Vegas, give me four more years!
65	00:03:16	00:03:20	That was fun. Let's do that again in about four years. Oh... (laughs)
66	00:03:21	00:03:23	I got a text.
67	00:03:23	00:03:24	From Maya.
68	00:03:24	00:03:26	Aw, Katie's not asleep.
69	00:03:26	00:03:28	She's waiting for her grandpa to come home. Aw...
70	00:03:28	00:03:30	Let's not disappoint her.
71	00:03:30	00:03:31	Hey.
72	00:03:31	00:03:33	What happened to the Hodges clan?
73	00:03:33	00:03:35	I sent them home. But our night's not over yet.
74	00:03:35	00:03:36	What do you mean?
75	00:03:36	00:03:38	We got a situation.
76	00:03:38	00:03:39	Triple.
77	00:03:39	00:03:41	I'll explain to Katie.
78	00:03:41	00:03:43	All right, let's roll.
79	00:03:43	00:03:45	Actually, we walk. Crime scene's just down the alley.
80	00:03:45	00:03:47	Hey. I'm sorry.
81	00:03:47	00:03:49	It's okay.
82	00:03:52	00:03:54	Detective Moreno.
83	00:03:54	00:03:57	Undersheriff. You know my partner, Mike Crenshaw.
84	00:03:57	00:03:58	Undersheriff.
85	00:03:58	00:04:04	Care to tell CSI's Russell and Brody what you told me? Uh, Mike and I have been working undercover, a drug op.
86	00:04:04	00:04:07	Our target is a dealer named Donny Price.
87	00:04:07	00:04:09	Small-time hood, big-time scumbag. Not anymore.
88	00:04:09	00:04:11	We had a buy set up here tonight.
89	00:04:11	00:04:13	Found him and his bodyguard shot in the head.
90	00:04:13	00:04:14	Yeah, the girlfriend's dead, too.
91	00:04:14	00:04:16	Drugs and cash gone.
92	00:04:16	00:04:19	Sounds like a textbook drug rip-off. I agree.
93	00:04:19	00:04:21	What-what's the situation?
94	00:04:36	00:04:39	This is our situation.
95	00:04:39	00:04:41	Who is she?
96	00:04:41	00:04:43	Veronica Gilmore.
97	00:04:43	00:04:45	Jack Gilmore's wife.
98	00:04:45	00:04:47	As in... our friend of the sheriff, Jack Gilmore?
99	00:04:47	00:04:49	Yep.
100	00:04:51	00:04:52	Whoa.
101	00:04:53	00:04:57	So much for statistics.
102	00:05:39	00:05:41	Nice dress.
103	00:05:41	00:05:43	(laughs) Yeah? Thanks.
104	00:05:44	00:05:46	Got an I.D. on the bodyguard.
105	00:05:46	00:05:48	Alonso Seal.
106	00:05:48	00:05:51	Doesn't like he was much of a bodyguard.
107	00:05:51	00:05:53	Couldn't even get his gun out.
108	00:05:53	00:05:55	No sign of forced entry.
109	00:05:55	00:05:57	Suggests he knew the gunman.
110	00:05:57	00:06:00	And it looks like Mr. Price here got caught with his pants down.
111	00:06:00	00:06:04	Beat in the kneecap before he was put out of his misery.
112	00:06:05	00:06:09	our bad guy steals the drugs...
113	00:06:09	00:06:11	makes a break for the door.
114	00:06:11	00:06:13	Shoe impressions are indistinct.
115	00:06:13	00:06:16	There's no discernable tread pattern.
116	00:06:19	00:06:21	Hey.
117	00:06:21	00:06:23	Come over here and take a look at this.
118	00:06:23	00:06:26	What do you see?
119	00:06:26	00:06:30	Impressions end at the doorway, but he didn't track any blood outside.
120	00:06:30	00:06:31	The guy was wearing booties.
121	00:06:31	00:06:33	Just like us.
122	00:06:33	00:06:35	Suggests planning, premeditation.
123	00:06:35	00:06:37	Mm-hmm.
124	00:06:37	00:06:41	You know, the one thing I don't think he planned for... What's that?
125	00:06:41	00:06:43	Eyewitness in the bathroom.
126	00:06:50	00:06:52	What can you tell me?
127	00:06:52	00:06:54	I've never seen anything like this.
128	00:06:54	00:06:55	I can't get a liver temp.
129	00:06:55	00:06:58	Fin, I can't even find her liver.
130	00:06:58	00:07:00	That's really weird. Yeah.
131	00:07:00	00:07:05	You know, for a drug rip-off, somebody went to an awful lot of trouble to silence her.
132	00:07:05	00:07:08	I mean, they could've just shot her, like the other two.
133	00:07:14	00:07:20	07 to her husband, Jack Gilmore.
134	00:07:20	00:07:21	Lasted four seconds.
135	00:07:22	00:07:27	I met Veronica when I was, uh... going through my divorce.
136	00:07:27	00:07:31	It was a low point in my life, and she...
137	00:07:31	00:07:33	she saved me.
138	00:07:33	00:07:35	Even back then, she, uh...
139	00:07:35	00:07:40	was drinking a little too much, partied too hard.
140	00:07:40	00:07:42	So I've just spent the last year trying to...
141	00:07:42	00:07:44	trying to save her.
142	00:07:44	00:07:46	So you knew that your wife was...
143	00:07:46	00:07:48	having an affair with Donny Price?
144	00:07:48	00:07:50	She left about four months ago.
145	00:07:50	00:07:52	Shacking up with the guy.
146	00:07:54	00:07:57	It's hard for me to even say, you know.
147	00:07:57	00:07:59	Jack, I'm so sorry.
148	00:07:59	00:08:04	One more question. When was the last time you spoke to your wife? I don't know, it was at least a week ago.
149	00:08:04	00:08:06	Uh, minus seven days.
150	00:08:06	00:08:11	Apparently, Mr. Gilmore's wife called him tonight, around the same time that she died.
151	00:08:11	00:08:14	Mr. Gilmore, CSI Finlay.
152	00:08:14	00:08:15	Couldn't have been much of a conversation.
153	00:08:15	00:08:17	It lasted about four seconds.
154	00:08:17	00:08:19	That's 'cause there wasn't any conversation.
155	00:08:19	00:08:27	My wife had the unfortunate habit of drunk-dialing me and hanging up. Assuming that it was your wife and not someone calling to tell you that she was dead.
156	00:08:27	00:08:29	Excuse me? Finlay, you're out of line.
157	00:08:29	00:08:30	Let's clear it up right now.
158	00:08:30	00:08:31	No need to get a warrant.
159	00:08:31	00:08:33	Let's look at your phone.
160	00:08:33	00:08:35	No, sir, you're not.
161	00:08:35	00:08:37	No, we're still just gathering information.
162	00:08:37	00:08:41	I'm sure you'll... you'll work with us when the time comes.
163	00:08:41	00:08:43	Let's get you a ride home.
164	00:08:45	00:08:47	Always the politician.
165	00:08:47	00:08:49	Boy, you never learn, do you?
166	00:08:49	00:08:51	Really.
167	00:08:54	00:08:56	Looks like a nine-mil.
168	00:08:56	00:08:58	Same as the others.
169	00:08:58	00:09:01	And the stippling indicates close-range shots.
170	00:09:01	00:09:06	Mr. Price... sustained an additional GSW to his knee.
171	00:09:06	00:09:10	Skull fracture suggests he was beaten with a blunt object, like a pistol.
172	00:09:10	00:09:14	Somebody enjoyed their work. Even more so with our female victim.
173	00:09:14	00:09:18	C.O.D. is massive internal hemorrhaging.
174	00:09:18	00:09:20	Now I know why David couldn't get liver temp.
175	00:09:20	00:09:22	Looks like soup.
176	00:09:22	00:09:26	She was hit so hard and so often, her internal organs disintegrated.
177	00:09:26	00:09:30	I did find a fleck embedded in her skin.
178	00:09:30	00:09:33	Appears to be some sort of synthetic.
179	00:09:33	00:09:37	We'll get it to Hodges. We'll see if we can identify the weapon.
180	00:09:37	00:09:42	The undersheriff is a friend of mine, and I like him, and I like that you like him.
181	00:09:42	00:09:49	In fact, I'm so glad about that that I think you and he Oh, yeah.
182	00:09:49	00:09:51	Uh, Mother, Mother, I... Hello?
183	00:09:51	00:09:52	I can't... I'm losing you.
184	00:09:52	00:09:55	Yes. I-I'll call you back.
185	00:09:55	00:09:57	(exhales) Any news on the fleck?
186	00:09:57	00:09:59	It's a work in progress.
187	00:09:59	00:10:01	Oh, yeah, well, text me when you got something.
188	00:10:01	00:10:03	Hey, um...
189	00:10:03	00:10:12	how are you doing with this whole my-mom- your-dad thing? I mean, who knew when we had the Meet the Parents dinner that our parents would actually meet?
190	00:10:12	00:10:15	Let's just hope they don't drag us on any more dates with them.
191	00:10:15	00:10:16	Or a wedding. I mean...
192	00:10:16	00:10:20	these things keep up, and we could end up as some sort of Bizarro Brady Bunch brother and sister.
193	00:10:20	00:10:23	Maybe we should start dating and throw a wrench into the works.
194	00:10:23	00:10:26	I-I can't. I was joking.
195	00:10:27	00:10:29	But why can't you?
196	00:10:29	00:10:31	Let's just say...
197	00:10:31	00:10:34	that my trip to Italy was life-changing.
198	00:10:34	00:10:38	(beeping) Ah. The fleck has spoken.
199	00:10:38	00:10:41	Doc was right-- it is synthetic.
200	00:10:41	00:10:44	Polyparaphenylene terephthalamide.
201	00:10:44	00:10:46	Kevlar combined with aluminum and carbon.
202	00:10:46	00:10:48	Sounds like an aluminum bat.
203	00:10:48	00:10:50	Very... old-school, like the Goodfellas or something.
204	00:10:50	00:10:53	Yeah, guy walks into a drug den and takes care of business.
205	00:10:53	00:10:56	Pops the first two guys, silences the witness.
206	00:10:56	00:10:57	He did more than silence her.
207	00:10:57	00:11:01	Autopsy shows that Veronica Gilmore sustained more than 50 blows to her head and body.
208	00:11:01	00:11:04	Look, I know you think that Jack Gilmore's behind this, but...
209	00:11:04	00:11:06	No, no, I don't think he's behind it.
210	00:11:06	00:11:07	I think he did it.
211	00:11:07	00:11:09	Oh, come on, whoa, stop, listen to me.
212	00:11:09	00:11:11	Boy, you don't learn, do you?
213	00:11:11	00:11:12	What?
214	00:11:12	00:11:13	Let's not repeat history here.
215	00:11:13	00:11:15	Please. I'm not talking about history.
216	00:11:15	00:11:17	I am talking about this case.
217	00:11:17	00:11:18	So am I.
218	00:11:18	00:11:24	Good. It is no coincidence that Jack Gilmore's wife was murdered at that motel.
219	00:11:24	00:11:25	Okay, all right, all right.
220	00:11:25	00:11:31	I will give you that the guy might have hired somebody to kill his wife, but he was not at that motel.
221	00:11:31	00:11:33	No, no, he was at the fund-raiser, right?
222	00:11:33	00:11:37	Where every major figure in Vegas law enforcement was present.
223	00:11:37	00:11:39	They all saw him. I saw him.
224	00:11:39	00:11:41	You only think you saw him.
225	00:11:43	00:11:44	What am I looking at?
226	00:11:44	00:11:50	Jack Gilmore in the alley between the casino where the fund-raiser was held, 07.
227	00:11:50	00:11:52	That's right around the time of the murders.
228	00:11:52	00:11:55	Two minutes after he gave the podium to the sheriff.
229	00:11:55	00:11:58	Did you get all this from his phone records?
230	00:11:58	00:12:01	Yeah, I did, and I got a warrant from Brass. Don't worry.
231	00:12:01	00:12:04	I also got the sheriff's speech, and I timed it.
232	00:12:04	00:12:05	18 minutes and six seconds.
233	00:12:05	00:12:07	Plenty of time to slip away.
234	00:12:07	00:12:11	I saw Gilmore at that reception right after the speech.
235	00:12:11	00:12:14	Mm.
236	00:12:14	00:12:20	So you really think that he could commit three gruesome murders in an 18-minute time span.
237	00:12:20	00:12:22	Get in, get out, get back to the party.
238	00:12:22	00:12:26	Well, you know, there's only way to figure out if that's even possible.
239	00:12:26	00:12:28	Yeah, you guys need to take a walk.
240	00:12:28	00:12:30	How we doing?
241	00:12:30	00:12:34	Uh, 36 seconds from the ballroom to the kitchen to the loading dock.
242	00:12:34	00:12:38	Killer's moving at a deliberate pace, but doesn't want to attract any attention.
243	00:12:38	00:12:40	Yeah. He's taking his own sweet time, just like us.
244	00:12:40	00:12:42	What's that supposed to mean?
245	00:12:42	00:12:49	Well, I think it's a good idea that we take a walk, but shouldn't somebody be putting pressure on Jack Gilmore, like, right now?
246	00:12:49	00:12:51	Hey, I'm down, but do you think D.B.'s gonna go for it?
247	00:12:51	00:12:55	No way. So, tell me, what is the deal with you two?
248	00:12:55	00:12:59	What is all this, don't repeat history stuff about anyway?
249	00:12:59	00:13:01	Well, you know that he fired me in Seattle.
250	00:13:01	00:13:03	Really? I heard he asked for your resignation.
251	00:13:03	00:13:06	Yeah. What's the difference?
252	00:13:06	00:13:07	Yeah, well, what's the story?
253	00:13:07	00:13:09	Well, there was this girl, Janet Warren.
254	00:13:09	00:13:11	Mm-hmm.
255	00:13:11	00:13:15	And she worked for this really powerful venture capital, Tom Cooley.
256	00:13:15	00:13:17	He was a real son of a bitch.
257	00:13:17	00:13:18	And one day, she went missing.
258	00:13:18	00:13:21	We never found her.
259	00:13:21	00:13:25	I had hair, carpet fibers and semen, and all I needed was Cooley's DNA.
260	00:13:25	00:13:27	And what, you couldn't get it?
261	00:13:27	00:13:30	Oh, I got it. I just couldn't test it.
262	00:13:30	00:13:31	Oh, why not?
263	00:13:31	00:13:33	Oh, some BS technicality.
264	00:13:33	00:13:37	It was really that Cooley had very powerful friends, and they protected him.
265	00:13:37	00:13:38	And Russell? Russell.
266	00:13:38	00:13:39	Russell was Russell.
267	00:13:39	00:13:40	Huh.
268	00:13:40	00:13:42	What was his sage advice?
269	00:13:42	00:13:43	Oh.
270	00:13:43	00:13:44	It's not who you know.
271	00:13:44	00:13:45	It's what you can prove.
272	00:13:45	00:13:47	Yes. Live to fight another day.
273	00:13:47	00:13:49	That's always a great thing to tell the victims' families.
274	00:13:49	00:13:50	Exactly.
275	00:13:50	00:13:52	Been there.
276	00:13:52	00:13:54	We're at two minutes, 40.
277	00:13:58	00:14:00	Show time.
278	00:14:00	00:14:02	Gilmore shoots the bodyguard.
279	00:14:02	00:14:04	Two minutes, 43 seconds.
280	00:14:04	00:14:06	Gilmore then takes care of Price.
281	00:14:06	00:14:10	Three minutes, 18 seconds.
282	00:14:10	00:14:12	And now, the main event.
283	00:14:12	00:14:13	No!
284	00:14:13	00:14:17	Gilmore beat his wife Veronica over 50 times.
285	00:14:17	00:14:21	FINLAY Even savoring the moment, eight minutes, tops.
286	00:14:21	00:14:25	So, what, that gives him ten minutes to make it back to the party? Yup.
287	00:14:25	00:14:27	Yeah, but not enough time to change your tuxedo. Mm.
288	00:14:27	00:14:28	I mean, look at this.
289	00:14:28	00:14:32	There must have been blood flying around all over the place.
290	00:14:32	00:14:34	Yeah, he must have worn something over his tuxedo.
291	00:14:34	00:14:36	He must have gotten rid of it somewhere.
292	00:14:36	00:14:38	Let's suit up, retrace our steps.
293	00:14:42	00:14:46	Okay, your turn.
294	00:14:46	00:14:47	Come on.
295	00:14:47	00:14:49	What happened to chivalry?
296	00:14:49	00:14:52	It died about five dumpsters ago.
297	00:14:56	00:14:58	Oh, so gross.
298	00:14:58	00:15:01	Yeah. Yeah.
299	00:15:01	00:15:02	Ew! Creamed corn.
300	00:15:02	00:15:04	Hmm.
301	00:15:04	00:15:06	Think I found something.
302	00:15:14	00:15:18	What do we have here?
303	00:15:18	00:15:21	Oversized warm-ups with blood on 'em.
304	00:15:21	00:15:23	Easy to pull over a tuxedo.
305	00:15:26	00:15:30	Hey, I think I found the murder weapon.
306	00:15:30	00:15:32	Kevlar, carbon fiber.
307	00:15:32	00:15:35	It's not a baseball bat. (camera shutter clicks)
308	00:15:35	00:15:37	It's a composite shaft of a hockey stick.
309	00:15:40	00:15:43	With the logo, Las Vegas Silver Strikes on it.
310	00:15:43	00:15:47	Same logo on the warm-up.
311	00:15:47	00:15:50	The Silver Strikes are Gilmore's hockey team.
312	00:15:50	00:15:53	Hope he's got a good defense.
313	00:16:01	00:16:03	Let's go! Keep it on the edge, guys.
314	00:16:03	00:16:05	Take us to the net.
315	00:16:05	00:16:06	Come on, keep it moving.
316	00:16:08	00:16:09	(grunt) Man-to-man!
317	00:16:09	00:16:12	You're supposed to be playing zone, fellas. Come on!
318	00:16:12	00:16:15	Looks like somebody needs a time-out.
319	00:16:15	00:16:17	Our practices are closed to the public.
320	00:16:17	00:16:18	Oh, we're not the public.
321	00:16:18	00:16:21	We have a warrant to search the arena.
322	00:16:25	00:16:28	I get the picture now.
323	00:16:28	00:16:29	This is harassment!
324	00:16:29	00:16:33	This is crap. The scope of the warrant is for the arena.
325	00:16:33	00:16:34	What about Gilmore's office?
326	00:16:34	00:16:36	His car? His home?
327	00:16:36	00:16:38	Well, we're getting there. One step at a time, Finn.
328	00:16:38	00:16:40	Yeah, I'd say that was good advice.
329	00:16:40	00:16:44	We need his DNA, because we cannot tie him to the warm-ups without an exemplar.
330	00:16:44	00:16:47	Jack Gilmore is still just a person of interest here.
331	00:16:47	00:16:49	He is not a suspect yet.
332	00:16:49	00:16:51	Friends with benefits.
333	00:16:51	00:16:53	I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
334	00:16:53	00:16:55	I know what you did in Seattle.
335	00:16:55	00:17:03	Walked into a black-tie event, walked out with Tom Cooley's champagne glass in your purse, illegally obtaining his DNA evidence.
336	00:17:03	00:17:06	I think you need to remind your CSI that that's not how we do things here.
337	00:17:06	00:17:08	Oh, I think she heard you.
338	00:17:14	00:17:19	Kevlar, aluminum and carbon fiber.
339	00:17:19	00:17:20	Looks like our murder weapon. Yeah.
340	00:17:20	00:17:23	It's the wrong brand, though.
341	00:17:23	00:17:28	All these players have the same type of duffel, same team warm-ups. Yeah.
342	00:17:28	00:17:30	Our killer did his shopping here.
343	00:17:35	00:17:36	Reb-2.
344	00:17:36	00:17:39	Now, we're talking.
345	00:17:41	00:17:44	Ooh. Hold that for a second.
346	00:17:45	00:17:47	There's an extra blade in here.
347	00:17:47	00:17:51	But the stick you found in the Dumpster was missing a blade, right?
348	00:17:51	00:17:53	Was it broken off? No.
349	00:17:53	00:17:54	It wasn't broken off, actually.
350	00:17:54	00:17:56	It was removed.
351	00:17:56	00:18:00	See, these aren't your Papa Olaf's sticks we're talking about here, buddy.
352	00:18:00	00:18:02	Like everything else, hockey's gone hi-tech.
353	00:18:02	00:18:05	Sticks are composite now.
354	00:18:05	00:18:07	Blades can be switched on and off pretty easily.
355	00:18:07	00:18:11	We found scratches inside the throat of the stick our killer used.
356	00:18:11	00:18:14	Check it out.
357	00:18:14	00:18:17	Now, is it just me, or do those markings look very similar?
358	00:18:17	00:18:18	Whose locker is that from?
359	00:18:18	00:18:21	Peter Gagne.
360	00:18:21	00:18:24	Gagne's been benched a few times before.
361	00:18:24	00:18:25	He's got a rap sheet.
362	00:18:25	00:18:26	Assault, gambling debts.
363	00:18:26	00:18:28	But also an alibi.
364	00:18:28	00:18:29	Oh, yeah? What's that?
365	00:18:29	00:18:31	Dinner with the wife and kids.
366	00:18:31	00:18:34	Okay, how does he explain his stick ending up a murder weapon?
367	00:18:34	00:18:36	Now that's an interesting story.
368	00:18:36	00:18:39	The equipment manager for the team is Dominic Bruno.
369	00:18:39	00:18:40	Now, why does that name sound familiar?
370	00:18:40	00:18:46	Well, he was a leg-breaker for Lou Gedda back in the day when Jack Gilmore was more friendly with the mob than the sheriff.
371	00:18:46	00:18:52	You know, if Gilmore is such a changed man, why's he have a guy like Bruno on the payroll?
372	00:18:52	00:18:55	I figured you'd be showing up on my door sooner or later.
373	00:18:55	00:18:57	I'd prefer sooner.
374	00:18:57	00:18:59	But I'm a patient man, Dominic.
375	00:18:59	00:19:01	And guys like you are always making the same mistakes.
376	00:19:01	00:19:03	Same could be said for you.
377	00:19:03	00:19:05	I heard about the boss's wife.
378	00:19:05	00:19:09	'Course you probably think I had something to do with it?
379	00:19:09	00:19:11	You know, you took the words right out of my mouth.
380	00:19:11	00:19:13	And the evidence right out of that locker.
381	00:19:13	00:19:15	You're losing your touch, Dom.
382	00:19:15	00:19:17	It's not your style.
383	00:19:17	00:19:21	Trying to pin it on a down-on-his-luck hockey player with obligations.
384	00:19:21	00:19:23	I had nothing to do with it, and I can prove it.
385	00:19:23	00:19:24	Oh, yeah?
386	00:19:24	00:19:26	How you going to do that?
387	00:19:26	00:19:30	Oh, like I said, I figured I'd be seeing you, so, a few months back, I recorded a conversation.
388	00:19:30	00:19:37	See, you're not the only one that came around here looking for the old Dom.
389	00:19:37	00:19:38	Hey, Dom. It's Jack.
390	00:19:38	00:19:40	You give some thought to our last conversation?
391	00:19:40	00:19:46	Yeah, boss, I did, and I don't think you're going to like the answer.
392	00:19:46	00:19:48	Come on, Dom. You owe me.
393	00:19:48	00:19:53	When you got out of the joint and couldn't get a job, I was the only one who hooked you up.
394	00:19:53	00:19:58	I took you in when all of our old friends had turned their backs on you.
395	00:19:58	00:20:00	You said someday you'd repay me.
396	00:20:00	00:20:03	If I ever needed anything, anything, you'd be there.
397	00:20:03	00:20:07	Scumbags like Donny Price deserve to die.
398	00:20:07	00:20:12	So, I'm asking you, I'm begging you, do this for me.
399	00:20:12	00:20:20	Boss, uh, that guy you knew before I went in the joint-- I'm not the same guy anymore.
400	00:20:20	00:20:22	I've changed.
401	00:20:22	00:20:26	You're not leaving me a lot of options, Dom.
402	00:20:26	00:20:32	I think this is the place where you lean over and give your client a little whisper in the ear there.
403	00:20:32	00:20:33	I can do my own talking, thanks.
404	00:20:33	00:20:35	Yeah, we heard.
405	00:20:37	00:20:40	All right, look, I reached out to Dom, okay?
406	00:20:40	00:20:41	But that's all I did.
407	00:20:41	00:20:43	He and I go a long way back.
408	00:20:43	00:20:48	Yeah, we know. All your old pals, like Gedda and McKeen, are all either dead or in jail.
409	00:20:48	00:20:50	Yeah, and there's a reason I'm neither.
410	00:20:50	00:20:52	Look...
411	00:20:52	00:20:55	I loved my wife, and I wanted to protect her.
412	00:20:55	00:20:59	But when Dom said, Hey, I'm not that guy anymore, I realized that I wasn't, either.
413	00:20:59	00:21:03	No, I think you realize that now's the time you were gonna take matters in your own hands.
414	00:21:03	00:21:05	The evidence is kind of stacking up.
415	00:21:05	00:21:09	Hockey stick swiped from the locker of one of your players.
416	00:21:09	00:21:15	Team warm-ups with your wife's DNA on the outside, your DNA on the inside.
417	00:21:15	00:21:23	Also on the inside is a little black thread, which I'm pretty sure will match your tuxedo.
418	00:21:23	00:21:27	See, I think you planned this whole thing four months ago when your wife, Veronica, left you for her drug dealer.
419	00:21:27	00:21:29	You planned it right down to the perfect alibi.
420	00:21:29	00:21:33	When all of Las Vegas law enforcement was at a party passing the hat for the sheriff.
421	00:21:34	00:21:36	Sorry to interrupt.
422	00:21:36	00:21:38	I have a question for you.
423	00:21:38	00:21:40	Oh, I thought maybe you could use a fresh cup.
424	00:21:42	00:21:47	Your, uh, cell phone put you in the alley.
425	00:21:47	00:21:49	What exactly were you doing there?
426	00:21:49	00:21:53	If you weren't on your way to the motel to kill your wife?
427	00:21:53	00:21:54	I was meeting a guy.
428	00:21:54	00:21:55	A guy?
429	00:21:55	00:21:57	That's the best you can do?
430	00:21:58	00:22:01	His name's Bobby Connor, okay?
431	00:22:01	00:22:04	He's a labor consultant, works for Turlington, L.L.P.
432	00:22:04	00:22:06	Usually, we meet at Al's Diner.
433	00:22:06	00:22:09	He's, um, helping me out with the soccer arena project.
434	00:22:09	00:22:11	So, this Bobby Connor can vouch for you?
435	00:22:14	00:22:16	Actually, he never showed up.
436	00:22:16	00:22:19	Oh, gee, that's not good.
437	00:22:20	00:22:21	I checked on his alibi.
438	00:22:21	00:22:22	There's no Bobby Connor.
439	00:22:22	00:22:26	There's not consulting firm, Turlington, L.L.P.
440	00:22:26	00:22:28	Looks like your boy's going down.
441	00:22:28	00:22:30	And it looks like CSI Finlay was right.
442	00:22:32	00:22:33	Thought you'd be a little happier about this.
443	00:22:33	00:22:36	Is there a butcher shop nearby?
444	00:22:36	00:22:39	I think there's one over in the mini-mall on Spring Mountain.
445	00:22:39	00:22:41	Great. Thanks.
446	00:23:02	00:23:04	Batter up.
447	00:23:26	00:23:28	We've got soup.
448	00:23:30	00:23:32	What's that?
449	00:23:32	00:23:33	That's liver soup.
450	00:23:33	00:23:36	Macerated like Veronica Gilmore's organs.
451	00:23:36	00:23:37	He didn't do it.
452	00:23:37	00:23:42	That took me 54 blows and all of my strength to make that soup happen.
453	00:23:42	00:23:43	Well, how's this let Gilmore off the hook?
454	00:23:43	00:23:46	I mean, he's a big guy, right? Ex-hockey player.
455	00:23:46	00:23:48	Who now has ALS.
456	00:23:48	00:23:49	Whoa.
457	00:23:49	00:23:51	He's been keeping it hidden.
458	00:23:51	00:23:58	His lawyers were very happy to turn over his medical records, which say that he has lost over 40% of his upper-body strength.
459	00:24:00	00:24:02	Which is why you brought him coffee.
460	00:24:02	00:24:05	Yeah, he couldn't even lift his arms beyond his shoulders.
461	00:24:05	00:24:08	Remember, he used two hands to carry the cup.
462	00:24:08	00:24:10	I do.
463	00:24:10	00:24:11	All right, wait, whoa, wait a second here.
464	00:24:11	00:24:13	Wh-What about the evidence?
465	00:24:13	00:24:16	We have his DNA on the warm-ups.
466	00:24:16	00:24:21	The killer must have stolen them, because Gilmore's got an open locker at the arena like everybody else.
467	00:24:21	00:24:24	Okay, what about the tuxedo thread that Hodges found?
468	00:24:24	00:24:25	He ran it.
469	00:24:25	00:24:28	It does not match Gilmore's tuxedo or any tuxedo.
470	00:24:28	00:24:32	The thread is nylon with traces of neoprene.
471	00:24:32	00:24:33	Neoprene.
472	00:24:33	00:24:46	Like a wetsuit. Yeah, a protective shield that our killer wore under the warm-ups to preserve Gilmore's DNA and only Gilmore's DNA while he was committing the crimes.
473	00:24:46	00:24:57	So, if you think about it, you've got the hockey stick, the warm-ups, the phone call from his wife's phone to Gilmore in the alley, while he's waiting for the mysterious stranger.
474	00:24:57	00:24:58	The whole thing was a frame-up.
475	00:24:58	00:25:03	So, if Gilmore's not our killer, then who is?
476	00:25:03	00:25:05	And why set him up?
477	00:25:09	00:25:11	Grandpa, when are you coming home?
478	00:25:11	00:25:12	Grandma and I made cookies.
479	00:25:12	00:25:14	Want to see?
480	00:25:14	00:25:16	Oatmeal raisin, your favorite.
481	00:25:16	00:25:18	Oh, wow.
482	00:25:18	00:25:20	Tell me you can resist these.
483	00:25:22	00:25:25	Uh, something tells me desert's gonna have to wait?
484	00:25:25	00:25:27	I'm sorry, sweetheart.
485	00:25:27	00:25:29	I'll try to get home by dinner time.
486	00:25:29	00:25:31	Don't worry, you do what you have to do.
487	00:25:31	00:25:32	Right? Yes.
488	00:25:32	00:25:34	Mwah. We'll see you soon.
489	00:25:34	00:25:36	Bye, Dad.
490	00:25:37	00:25:39	Saturday night was fun.
491	00:25:39	00:25:41	It was really fun.
492	00:25:41	00:25:43	I didn't even hear you leave. You didn't.
493	00:25:43	00:25:45	Hmm-mm. I hope that's not an omen for the future.
494	00:25:48	00:25:49	Oh.
495	00:25:49	00:25:51	Oh, your boyfriend.
496	00:25:51	00:25:53	Yeah, yours, too. Who's he with?
497	00:25:53	00:25:54	My boss. He runs vice.
498	00:25:54	00:25:56	What's up?
499	00:25:56	00:25:57	Kimball's gonna do the briefing.
500	00:25:57	00:25:59	Told us to go back into the field.
501	00:25:59	00:26:01	Catch you later.
502	00:26:01	00:26:02	Bye.
503	00:26:02	00:26:06	So, we're not talking about a husband killing his wife anymore?
504	00:26:06	00:26:08	No, ma'am, but that is what somebody wanted us to believe.
505	00:26:08	00:26:12	They took advantage of Jack's marital problems, set him up.
506	00:26:12	00:26:14	So, I guess we're back to square one.
507	00:26:14	00:26:16	We're talking about drugs.
508	00:26:16	00:26:18	Which is why I asked Lieutenant Kimball to join us.
509	00:26:18	00:26:21	He was in charge of the undercover op against Donny Price.
510	00:26:21	00:26:22	What do you got for us?
511	00:26:22	00:26:24	Price was a mid-level distributor.
512	00:26:24	00:26:26	We had a confidential informant inside the last four months.
513	00:26:26	00:26:29	We were getting closer to IDing his supplier.
514	00:26:29	00:26:31	Four months?
515	00:26:31	00:26:33	That's about the same time Veronica Gilmore...
516	00:26:33	00:26:35	Dumped her husband for her drug dealer.
517	00:26:35	00:26:38	I guess we know who your informant was, right?
518	00:26:38	00:26:41	Veronica Gilmore?
519	00:26:41	00:26:43	She got popped for possession.
520	00:26:43	00:26:45	She made a deal; only me and the D.A. knew.
521	00:26:45	00:26:47	I should have been looped in on this.
522	00:26:47	00:26:48	'Cause Jack Gilmore's your friend?
523	00:26:48	00:26:50	Because I'm your boss.
524	00:26:53	00:26:58	Well, we got a lot bigger problems than Jack Gilmore's sullied reputation.
525	00:26:58	00:26:59	Why? What do you mean?
526	00:26:59	00:27:02	Dead C.I., blown undercover op.
527	00:27:02	00:27:06	We got a leak in our department.
528	00:27:20	00:27:25	Hey. Hey, I'm just running the bullets we pulled out of Donny Price and his bodyguard.
529	00:27:25	00:27:27	The whole thing's crazy, right?
530	00:27:27	00:27:30	I mean, a frame job this elaborate, that makes you wonder who's behind it.
531	00:27:30	00:27:32	Yeah, I heard the department may be compromised.
532	00:27:32	00:27:33	We've been there before.
533	00:27:35	00:27:36	I don't believe it.
534	00:27:36	00:27:38	Looks like we're there again.
535	00:27:40	00:27:43	You texted me?
536	00:27:43	00:27:47	I think I may have just found this Bobby Connor guy.
537	00:27:47	00:27:48	Brass checked out Gilmore's story.
538	00:27:48	00:27:50	He said the guy doesn't exist.
539	00:27:50	00:27:54	Well, Gilmore's been meeting with somebody at Al's Diner.
540	00:27:54	00:27:57	The ATM across the street gave us a snapshot.
541	00:27:57	00:27:59	That guy was just here.
542	00:27:59	00:28:00	That's Lieutenant Paul Kimball.
543	00:28:00	00:28:03	He was running the undercover op on Donny Price.
544	00:28:03	00:28:09	Seriously? And if this is our fictional Bobby Connor, then he's the guy who set up the meeting in the alley with Gilmore.
545	00:28:09	00:28:10	Hey, Russell? Yeah?
546	00:28:10	00:28:12	We need to have a family meeting.
547	00:28:12	00:28:16	IBIS report came back on the bullets that killed Price and his bodyguard.
548	00:28:16	00:28:22	Gun was traced back to a cop who discharged the weapon during a domestic disturbance back in 2008, but the case was tossed.
549	00:28:22	00:28:23	Weapon was returned to the officer.
550	00:28:23	00:28:25	Hey, guys, where are we going with this?
551	00:28:25	00:28:27	Who are we talking about? It's Jeffrey McKeen.
552	00:28:27	00:28:30	You got to be kidding me.
553	00:28:30	00:28:32	Who's Jeffrey McKeen?
554	00:28:32	00:28:35	Former undersheriff, now serving life.
555	00:28:35	00:28:37	I read his file when I first got here.
556	00:28:37	00:28:42	Yeah, he murdered a good friend of mine, CSI Warrick Brown. He was a good friend of all of ours.
557	00:28:42	00:28:46	So, if McKeen's in prison, how does his gun end up committing all these murders?
558	00:28:46	00:28:47	He must have had someone do it for him.
559	00:28:47	00:28:49	Yeah, but what does he have to gain?
560	00:28:49	00:28:50	Yeah, I got an idea.
561	00:28:50	00:28:53	Didn't McKeen take over Lou Gedda's turf?
562	00:28:53	00:28:55	Start running his drugs and prostitution?
563	00:28:55	00:28:57	Yeah, before he went to prison.
564	00:28:57	00:28:58	So, maybe he hasn't stopped.
565	00:28:58	00:28:59	Like Gotti.
566	00:28:59	00:29:01	Godfathering from the inside.
567	00:29:01	00:29:05	If that's the case, then he's got people working for him on the outside. People like Paul Kimball.
568	00:29:05	00:29:08	You asked me to check him out.
569	00:29:08	00:29:11	Long before Lieutenant Kimball ran Vice...
570	00:29:11	00:29:12	guess who his first partner was?
571	00:29:12	00:29:14	Jeffrey McKeen.
572	00:29:14	00:29:18	If Kimball has ties to McKeen, then he's the one who set up Gilmore; he's our guy.
573	00:29:18	00:29:20	Yeah, so let's pick him up.
574	00:29:20	00:29:21	Undersheriff has eyes on him right now.
575	00:29:21	00:29:24	No, no, no, let's just keep eyes on him for now.
576	00:29:24	00:29:26	We got to play this smart.
577	00:29:26	00:29:28	Kimball's dirty, but we have no idea how deep this goes.
578	00:29:28	00:29:32	So, you buy Kimball as the shooter, but not as the guy on the outside calling the shots.
579	00:29:32	00:29:34	Kimball's an errand boy.
580	00:29:34	00:29:38	All we have to do is just see if he can takes us to whoever is calling the shots.
581	00:29:38	00:29:39	Let's bring McKeen in, all right?
582	00:29:39	00:29:41	Shake him up a little bit.
583	00:29:41	00:29:43	See who he reaches out to.
584	00:29:49	00:29:52	Russell, right?
585	00:29:52	00:29:56	You're the CSI that Ecklie brought in to right the ship.
586	00:29:56	00:29:58	How's that working out?
587	00:29:58	00:30:00	Great. How's prison working out for you?
588	00:30:00	00:30:01	Eh, you know, I get by.
589	00:30:01	00:30:02	Must be hard.
590	00:30:02	00:30:05	The walls, the distance.
591	00:30:05	00:30:09	Hard for a guy who likes to control things, do things himself.
592	00:30:10	00:30:11	Just like you murdered Warrick.
593	00:30:11	00:30:16	Now come on, you know I didn't enjoy that, Stokes.
594	00:30:16	00:30:19	And Warrick didn't give me a choice.
595	00:30:19	00:30:22	Is that what happened with Donny Price and Veronica Gilmore?
596	00:30:22	00:30:23	You know, I'd heard Veronica had died.
597	00:30:23	00:30:25	Is that why I'm here?
598	00:30:25	00:30:27	Who told you that Gilmore wanted his wife killed?
599	00:30:27	00:30:29	I don't know what you're talking about.
600	00:30:29	00:30:30	You screwed up, McKeen.
601	00:30:30	00:30:36	Your people tried to pin it on Gilmore, but they used a gun that traced right back to you.
602	00:30:37	00:30:39	Triple homicide.
603	00:30:39	00:30:43	So, you help us, we help you or it goes the other way.
604	00:30:43	00:30:47	I'm a lifer, and you got nothing.
605	00:30:47	00:30:51	Oh, I don't know, we can get you out of the general population.
606	00:30:51	00:30:55	Caged with all those animals.
607	00:30:55	00:30:57	The cage is just fine.
608	00:30:57	00:30:59	You see, this is the thing.
609	00:30:59	00:31:01	On the inside, I'm a cop.
610	00:31:01	00:31:03	I'm also a cop-killer.
611	00:31:03	00:31:07	And those two bullets that I put in your friend, Warrick, well...
612	00:31:09	00:31:11	That made me a hero.
613	00:31:14	00:31:18	I'm gonna get some air before I tear your head off.
614	00:31:29	00:31:31	Boy, he's got that bad cop thing down.
615	00:31:31	00:31:32	Here's the deal.
616	00:31:32	00:31:36	I figure that you're providing for your family from behind bars, right?
617	00:31:36	00:31:43	Cash. One phone call from me, and your family is living out of a car.
618	00:31:45	00:31:49	You leave my family out of this, D.B.
619	00:31:49	00:31:51	Up to you, hotshot.
620	00:31:53	00:31:58	Sure hope Russell knows what he's doing.
621	00:31:58	00:32:00	Everyone's got some weakness.
622	00:32:00	00:32:02	Especially when it comes to family.
623	00:32:06	00:32:10	Here's 200 grand cash; McKeen wants you out of town now.
624	00:32:13	00:32:15	It's all there; you can count it.
625	00:32:15	00:32:18	I don't trust you. I trust McKeen.
626	00:32:18	00:32:22	Trust me when I tell you, if you show your face, it'll be me signing the contract.
627	00:32:22	00:32:24	I guess we just found our shot-caller.
628	00:32:24	00:32:25	Yeah.
629	00:32:25	00:32:28	Russell really did rattle McKeen's cage.
630	00:32:28	00:32:29	And Kimball led us right to him. Mm-hmm.
631	00:32:29	00:32:32	Your Vegas privileges are pulled.
632	00:32:32	00:32:35	New passport, first-class tickets.
633	00:32:35	00:32:36	You'll be having margaritas by morning.
634	00:32:36	00:32:38	I don't get it.
635	00:32:38	00:32:40	That's Gilmore's finance guy, Winnock.
636	00:32:40	00:32:43	That's the last person I would have expected.
637	00:32:45	00:32:46	We just got made.
638	00:32:59	00:33:01	Drop the gun, Winnock.
639	00:33:02	00:33:04	Do it now!
640	00:33:06	00:33:07	I'm not McKeen.
641	00:33:08	00:33:11	I'm not going to prison.
642	00:33:25	00:33:27	He's dead.
643	00:33:27	00:33:30	Yeah, and we just lost our best shot at bringing McKeen down.
644	00:33:38	00:33:40	So, where are we on Kimball?
645	00:33:40	00:33:45	Well, Moreno and Crenshaw found his car abandoned, but they they got him on this watch list.
646	00:33:45	00:33:48	They said he never hopped on that plane to Mexico.
647	00:33:48	00:33:52	$200,000-- he can go pretty much anywhere he wants.
648	00:33:52	00:33:53	That's true. We need to talk.
649	00:33:53	00:33:54	Another family meeting?
650	00:33:54	00:33:57	No, but family is the issue.
651	00:33:57	00:34:00	I got the autopsy results on David Winnock.
652	00:34:00	00:34:04	C.O.D. was two gunshot wounds to the chest.
653	00:34:04	00:34:06	Yeah, tell us something we don't know.
654	00:34:06	00:34:08	No, keep reading-- the DNA part.
655	00:34:08	00:34:10	Hit on CODIS.
656	00:34:11	00:34:13	Familial match.
657	00:34:13	00:34:15	Exactly.
658	00:34:15	00:34:18	David Winnock has 13 alleles in common with Jeffrey McKeen.
659	00:34:18	00:34:23	Yeah, Winnock wasn't just McKeen's shot-caller, he was his son.
660	00:34:23	00:34:26	What could you possibly want from me that you don't already know?
661	00:34:26	00:34:30	His mother was a dancer at Pigalle, married to a pit boss named Winnock.
662	00:34:30	00:34:36	The boy had his name but my blood, and as he got older, I realized he had my heart, too.
663	00:34:37	00:34:39	I took care of both of them.
664	00:34:39	00:34:43	And when he grew up, your boy took care of business for you, didn't he?
665	00:34:43	00:34:45	You're damn right.
666	00:34:45	00:34:47	He was my son.
667	00:34:47	00:34:48	He was family.
668	00:34:48	00:34:52	And now you know how it feels, you son of a bitch.
669	00:34:52	00:34:54	Karma, Jeffrey.
670	00:34:54	00:34:56	Your son paid for your sins.
671	00:34:56	00:34:59	And I know you're the one that put the bullet in him, Conrad.
672	00:34:59	00:35:03	Hey, you're the one that put the target on his back.
673	00:35:03	00:35:04	If you want to blame someone, look in the mirror.
674	00:35:04	00:35:06	Don't get smug with me.
675	00:35:06	00:35:10	Your dead pal was no saint.
676	00:35:10	00:35:13	I should have killed your punk ass when I had the chance.
677	00:35:13	00:35:16	Yeah, you should have.
678	00:35:16	00:35:18	A real man would have.
679	00:35:20	00:35:23	Nick.
680	00:35:24	00:35:26	I might just get that chance again.
681	00:35:26	00:35:29	I'll make sure to clear my calendar.
682	00:35:30	00:35:32	The guy lives up to his reputation.
683	00:35:32	00:35:33	Yeah.
684	00:35:33	00:35:35	You got anything?
685	00:35:35	00:35:36	Detectives went over to Winnock's office.
686	00:35:36	00:35:40	Somebody beat us to it, cleaned out his files.
687	00:35:40	00:35:42	Still nothing on Kimball.
688	00:35:42	00:35:43	Only five roads lead out of Vegas.
689	00:35:43	00:35:45	We got eyes on all of them.
690	00:35:45	00:35:47	If we can trust our eyes anymore.
691	00:35:47	00:35:51	I mean, who knows how deep this thing goes, how many cops McKeen has his hooks into?
692	00:35:51	00:35:55	Sheriff's called a press conference.
693	00:35:55	00:35:56	Storm's coming.
694	00:35:56	00:35:58	Heads are going to roll.
695	00:35:58	00:35:59	Yeah, hers may be the first.
696	00:35:59	00:36:01	Thank you all for coming.
697	00:36:01	00:36:15	The district attorney and I are here to announce that, as of tomorrow morning, a commission will begin investigating allegations of corruption, bribery, and murder within the Las Vegas Police Department.
698	00:36:15	00:36:23	Four years ago, when I took office, I promised change, that the misdeeds of the past would be just that.
699	00:36:24	00:36:26	What a load of crap.
700	00:36:26	00:36:29	The investigation or the department?
701	00:36:29	00:36:32	Both. I hate to say it, but the sheriff's right.
702	00:36:32	00:36:37	We went through this four years ago when McKeen was exposed, and things got better.
703	00:36:37	00:36:39	Liston was elected, made changes.
704	00:36:39	00:36:41	And now she's talking about changes again.
705	00:36:41	00:36:43	That's what I'm saying.
706	00:36:43	00:36:46	Warrick's dead and McKeen's still in business.
707	00:36:46	00:36:47	It's all just talk.
708	00:36:47	00:36:53	I vow tonight to clean up this department once and for all.
709	00:36:53	00:36:55	No one will be above suspicion.
710	00:36:55	00:36:58	No one will get a free pass, not even me.
711	00:36:58	00:37:00	Hey. Hey.
712	00:37:00	00:37:02	See this?
713	00:37:02	00:37:04	(sighs) You know, it's going to get ugly.
714	00:37:04	00:37:06	Hope you don't regret me dragging you here.
715	00:37:06	00:37:08	Hey, I make my own decisions.
716	00:37:08	00:37:20	Look, I-I know the Gilmore case dragged up a lot of stuff between us from the past, but, for what it's worth, in Seattle I never said you were wrong.
717	00:37:20	00:37:22	Well, then, why did you fire me?
718	00:37:22	00:37:25	Oh, come on, you got to admit, it was a little...
719	00:37:25	00:37:28	Just don't say that it was complicated.
720	00:37:29	00:37:31	All right, I won't say it.
721	00:37:31	00:37:32	I really hate you sometimes.
722	00:37:32	00:37:34	Hey, you know what you should do?
723	00:37:34	00:37:36	Come on over to the house tonight, have dinner with us.
724	00:37:36	00:37:37	Maya and Katie are there.
725	00:37:37	00:37:39	They'd love to see you.
726	00:37:39	00:37:41	I have plans.
727	00:37:41	00:37:42	Okay.
728	00:37:48	00:37:56	As of tomorrow morning, LVPD will no longer function as an independent law enforcement agency.
729	00:37:59	00:38:01	Conrad, are you okay?
730	00:38:01	00:38:02	Yeah, sure.
731	00:38:02	00:38:04	You enjoy your dinner?
732	00:38:04	00:38:05	And the company.
733	00:38:07	00:38:09	We have to do it again, just the two of us.
734	00:38:09	00:38:11	That'll be nice.
735	00:38:11	00:38:13	Ah, here's your car.
736	00:38:13	00:38:16	I'll drive, Mother. Uh, I'd rather you didn't.
737	00:38:16	00:38:18	Good night, everyone.
738	00:38:18	00:38:20	Night.
739	00:38:23	00:38:26	You were kind of quiet at dinner.
740	00:38:26	00:38:30	I, I just got a lot on my mind.
741	00:38:34	00:38:37	Want to take a walk?
742	00:38:37	00:38:39	Yeah.
743	00:38:42	00:38:43	Another one.
744	00:38:43	00:38:44	No. Yes.
745	00:38:44	00:38:46	Yes. You are on your own.
746	00:38:46	00:38:47	Ooh.
747	00:38:47	00:38:50	I'm very happy to be on my own.
748	00:38:50	00:38:53	All right, what's going on with you tonight?
749	00:38:54	00:38:56	It's complicated.
750	00:38:56	00:38:57	Yeah?
751	00:38:57	00:39:01	You ever think that maybe you're the one that's a little bit complicated, hmm?
752	00:39:01	00:39:04	You know what? It's so much hotter when you don't talk.
753	00:39:10	00:39:12	Think I'm gonna go home.
754	00:39:19	00:39:23	You knucklehead, you've got your pajamas backwards.
755	00:39:23	00:39:25	I wear them that way.
756	00:39:25	00:39:26	Oh, I see.
757	00:39:26	00:39:27	Little Miss Free Spirit.
758	00:39:27	00:39:29	Oh, wonder where she gets that.
759	00:39:30	00:39:31	Charlie just called.
760	00:39:31	00:39:34	Team bus got in from the tournament, so he's on his way.
761	00:39:34	00:39:35	Bet he'll be hungry. I'll warm him up a plate.
762	00:39:35	00:39:37	And I'll read a bedtime story.
763	00:39:37	00:39:38	Any takers? Me.
764	00:39:38	00:39:40	Anyone else?
765	00:39:40	00:39:41	Uh, you go ahead.
766	00:39:41	00:39:43	I think Mr. Merlot is going to put me to bed.
767	00:39:44	00:39:46	Go on, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot.
768	00:39:46	00:39:47	Good night.
769	00:39:47	00:39:48	Good night.
770	00:39:48	00:39:51	Dad just never changes, does he?
771	00:39:51	00:39:52	No.
772	00:39:52	00:39:54	What are you saying?
773	00:39:54	00:40:00	I mean, it's not like it's going to make any difference 'cause in this town it's all about the game.
774	00:40:00	00:40:02	The game never changes, just the players.
775	00:40:02	00:40:06	I'm starting to think that Catherine was right.
776	00:40:06	00:40:08	What, leaving?
777	00:40:08	00:40:11	No, Greg, quitting.
778	00:40:11	00:40:14	Oh, come on, Nick, I know things have been crazy right now, but...
779	00:40:14	00:40:19	Hey, she once told me, If you can't handle this job, there is the door.
780	00:40:19	00:40:21	You know what?
781	00:40:26	00:40:28	I'm out.
782	00:40:29	00:40:31	Nick.
783	00:40:31	00:40:33	Hey.
784	00:40:33	00:40:36	I've seen that look.
785	00:40:36	00:40:38	Try driving around with him all day long.
786	00:40:40	00:40:44	You look like someone that doesn't need to talk to someone right now, right?
787	00:40:46	00:40:48	I could be persuaded.
788	00:40:48	00:40:50	Good.
789	00:40:54	00:40:55	Is that a girlfriend?
790	00:40:55	00:40:57	Not right now.
791	00:40:57	00:40:58	Can I see?
792	00:40:58	00:41:01	Ah, whoa, she wouldn't like that.
793	00:41:03	00:41:05	I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
794	00:41:07	00:41:09	You gonna be here when I get back?
795	00:41:09	00:41:10	If you're lucky.
796	00:41:18	00:41:20	It's under control.
797	00:41:20	00:41:22	Got eyes on the package right now.
798	00:41:22	00:41:25	Where are we going, anyway?
799	00:41:25	00:41:34	Remember when I was a little girl and I'd come visit you and you would drag me to ride the roller coaster at New York, New York?
800	00:41:34	00:41:37	I thought you hated that roller coaster.
801	00:41:37	00:41:41	I wanted you to think that I hated it.
802	00:41:41	00:41:42	I'm sorry.
803	00:41:42	00:41:44	I was a brat.
804	00:41:44	00:41:46	No, no, no, I deserved it.
805	00:41:47	00:41:49	Not anymore.
806	00:41:49	00:41:51	Hey, Undersheriff.
807	00:41:54	00:41:58	Dad, Dad... Dad!
808	00:41:58	00:42:01	I think you missed your calling.
809	00:42:01	00:42:03	Always good to have something to fall back on.
810	00:42:05	00:42:06	Oh...
811	00:42:06	00:42:08	Oh, do you have to get it?
812	00:42:08	00:42:11	Don't move, I'll be right back.
813	00:42:16	00:42:18	Hey, Sara, what's up?
814	00:42:19	00:42:21	Where?
815	00:42:21	00:42:23	(phone rings) Oh, God, all right, oh.
816	00:42:23	00:42:24	Hello. All right, rally the troops.
817	00:42:24	00:42:26	I-I'll be there in five minutes.
818	00:42:28	00:42:30	What?
819	00:42:30	00:42:32	He said to look upstairs.
820	00:42:36	00:42:38	Katie.
821	00:42:38	00:42:40	Kaitlyn. Hey, Kate.
822	00:42:43	00:42:45	Oh, no.
823	00:42:45	00:42:46	They've taken her.
824	00:42:46	00:42:49	(grunts) Don't touch anything.
