0,00:00:13,00:00:15,"Okay, back that thing up."
1,00:00:15,00:00:18,I thought you just wanted to steal some gloss off my lips. (giggling)
2,00:00:18,00:00:19,And you bought it. (sighs)
3,00:00:19,00:00:20,Hey.
4,00:00:20,00:00:23,You are hotter than anyone in there.
5,00:00:23,00:00:27,"WOMAN: For $1,000, I'll take you around the world. MAN: I think I love you."
6,00:00:27,00:00:30,God should just flush this city down the toilet.
7,00:00:30,00:00:31,"Look, hey..."
8,00:00:31,00:00:32,I'm going to go find our limo.
9,00:00:34,00:00:36,Where it's safe.
10,00:00:41,00:00:43,(gunshots)
11,00:00:44,00:00:46,(screaming)
12,00:00:56,00:00:59,(car alarm blaring)
13,00:00:59,00:01:01,"Huskins, you first responding? Yes, sir."
14,00:01:01,00:01:05,"We got one dead guy in the limo, the rest are cuts and bruises. So, what's the story?"
15,00:01:05,00:01:06,Witnesses are pretty much in sync.
16,00:01:06,00:01:10,"They heard, uh, several gunshots from down the street, they saw the limo and everybody started hightailin' it. Right."
17,00:01:10,00:01:12,"Running the Bulls, Las Vegas style. (chuckling)"
18,00:01:12,00:01:14,"So, I got a feeling the driver didn't see anything."
19,00:01:14,00:01:18,"No, sir. Make sure you do Nystagmus before we pound him through the FSTs."
20,00:01:18,00:01:20,Limo equals drugs and whatnot.
21,00:01:20,00:01:21,And collect all the cell phones.
22,00:01:21,00:01:23,"Are we authorized to do that, sir?"
23,00:01:23,00:01:24,No.
24,00:01:24,00:01:28,"Hey, anybody have any photos or video of the crash?"
25,00:01:28,00:01:30,"If you do, I promise to get them on Channel 8 News."
26,00:01:30,00:01:31,(clamoring)
27,00:01:31,00:01:33,Wow.
28,00:01:34,00:01:37,You better wear gloves before you do the collection There's a lot of interrupted lap dances out there.
29,00:01:37,00:01:38,"Yes, sir."
30,00:01:38,00:01:39,We got one on the guy in the limo.
31,00:01:40,00:01:41,A passenger.
32,00:01:41,00:01:43,Paramedics are working on him now.
33,00:01:43,00:01:44,Name's Kellen Tyford.
34,00:01:44,00:01:46,"Oh, Kellen. I know Kellen."
35,00:01:46,00:02:06,"Calls himself ""Drops."" This is what happens when you don't wear your seatbelt."
36,00:02:06,00:02:07,PHILLIPS: That's why I always do.
37,00:02:08,00:02:09,It's the law.
38,00:02:09,00:02:10,Even in limos.
39,00:02:11,00:02:13,PHILLIPS: Found a wallet.
40,00:02:13,00:02:16,Got a license.
41,00:02:16,00:02:20,"Vic's name is ""Champ Landley."" SANDERS: Open champagne bottle."
42,00:02:20,00:02:24,White powder residue.
43,00:02:24,00:02:26,I'll guess coke.
44,00:02:27,00:02:30,"GRISSOM: Well, then that must be..."
45,00:02:30,00:02:32,his brain on drugs.
46,00:02:32,00:02:34,Party till you drop.
47,00:02:34,00:02:37,"Or get shot, whichever comes first."
48,00:03:17,00:03:19,Konnichiwa.
49,00:03:19,00:03:20,Konnichiwa.Look.
50,00:03:20,00:03:22,"I ain't in the mood, man."
51,00:03:22,00:03:24,"So, let me guess, you don't have any blood on your hands."
52,00:03:24,00:03:25,"Oh, look at that, you do."
53,00:03:25,00:03:27,"Yeah, I got blood on my face, too."
54,00:03:28,00:03:29,How about that?
55,00:03:29,00:03:30,"So, who's the dead guy?"
56,00:03:30,00:03:32,It's Champ.
57,00:03:32,00:03:33,"Yeah, we know that, but who's he to you?"
58,00:03:34,00:03:36,"Huh? It's family, man."
59,00:03:36,00:03:38,"So, he's your ""cuz"", he's your gang buddy."
60,00:03:38,00:03:41,"Look, B, I ain't no Blud and I ain't no Crip."
61,00:03:41,00:03:43,Champ's just a cool kid I knew from around the way.
62,00:03:43,00:03:47,I met his ass over two decades ago riding my Big Wheel.
63,00:03:47,00:03:48,We go back like your hairline.
64,00:03:48,00:03:49,That's family.
65,00:03:49,00:03:52,"So, how did his b-l-u-d end up on your face?"
66,00:03:52,00:03:57,"We was parlayin', chillin', slidin' to the strip club, mindin' our own."
67,00:03:57,00:03:59,(glasses clink)
68,00:04:02,00:04:04,(thudding)
69,00:04:04,00:04:07,(gunshot)
70,00:04:07,00:04:09,"So, what'd you do, piss off some rapper band again?"
71,00:04:09,00:04:13,The only bands I'm playin' with now is the one's I'm ripping off stacks of green.
72,00:04:13,00:04:15,"And I ain't talking about weed, B."
73,00:04:15,00:04:18,"You're the big cheese maker. What's your secret, anyway? I promote events, parties."
74,00:04:18,00:04:20,I help the club life pop.
75,00:04:20,00:04:24,"Well, you must be throwing some pretty crappy parties for someone to want you and your buddy dead."
76,00:04:24,00:04:25,Huh?
77,00:04:25,00:04:26,"So, tell me."
78,00:04:26,00:04:27,Who lit you up?
79,00:04:27,00:04:29,"I don't know, okay?"
80,00:04:29,00:04:31,"Could be everybody, man, could be nobody."
81,00:04:31,00:04:32,Okay.
82,00:04:32,00:04:34,Let's start with everybody.
83,00:04:34,00:04:37,I know a lot of people-- friends and foes.
84,00:04:37,00:04:38,They know I come here late night.
85,00:04:39,00:04:44,"Or maybe, maybe the limo driver cut somebody off and we're the victims of road rage, how about that?"
86,00:04:44,00:04:46,"Look, we're going to take you down to the station."
87,00:04:46,00:04:48,You can't be ser...
88,00:04:48,00:04:50,I'm the one that got shot at!
89,00:04:50,00:04:55,"You know the rigamarole: we need an official statement, we need your clothes, we need your prints, we need your DNA."
90,00:04:56,00:04:57,Because you're a concerned citizen.
91,00:04:57,00:04:59,You want to help us find out who did this.
92,00:04:59,00:05:01,Unless you already know.
93,00:05:05,00:05:07,Got a nine mill over here.
94,00:05:07,00:05:09,.45 auto casing.
95,00:05:09,00:05:12,This neighborhood rains lead.
96,00:05:12,00:05:16,"Yeah, and we have to process every last drop of it."
97,00:05:16,00:05:19,We're going to make Bobby Dawson's boat payment this month.
98,00:05:19,00:05:20,HODGES: I was right.
99,00:05:20,00:05:22,This is a lot like garbage colleting.
100,00:05:22,00:05:25,"You're not helping, Hodges."
101,00:05:25,00:05:27,I have no intention to.
102,00:05:27,00:05:29,Field rotation for the Lab Techs was Ecklie's idea.
103,00:05:29,00:05:32,He was very explicit that I was only allowed to observe.
104,00:05:37,00:05:41,"Looks like a .38, maybe a .357."
105,00:05:41,00:05:45,GRISSOM: It's a little small for those golf-ball size holes we found in that limo.
106,00:05:45,00:05:47,(clears throat) A little help?
107,00:05:59,00:06:01,.50 caliber.
108,00:06:01,00:06:03,Casing looks new.
109,00:06:03,00:06:05,I bet it's from a Desert Eagle.
110,00:06:05,00:06:07,Or a coffee shop.
111,00:06:07,00:06:11,I could drink an espresso out of that thing.
112,00:06:11,00:06:13,CURTIS: Residential area.
113,00:06:13,00:06:14,Not much traffic.
114,00:06:14,00:06:17,"Landscaper found the body, called 911."
115,00:06:17,00:06:19,Driver's license is in her purse.
116,00:06:19,00:06:21,"Her name's Melissa Gentry, lives off Nellis."
117,00:06:21,00:06:23,We're trying to contact the family.
118,00:06:23,00:06:27,"BROWN: Little bit outside of her neighborhood, isn't it?"
119,00:06:27,00:06:28,Definitely.
120,00:06:28,00:06:31,Party clothes shredded.
121,00:06:31,00:06:33,Breaded abrasions.
122,00:06:33,00:06:35,Must've hit the ground moving.
123,00:06:35,00:06:38,WILLOWS: No car keys and no unaccounted for...
124,00:06:38,00:06:39,cars in the vicinity.
125,00:06:39,00:06:41,You thinking she got jacked?
126,00:06:41,00:06:46,"She gets taken along for the ride, jumps out trying to escape."
127,00:06:46,00:06:48,(screaming)
128,00:06:48,00:06:52,"Maybe she was killed first, and this is a body dump at high speed."
129,00:06:52,00:06:57,"I'm going to go bang on some doors, see if anyone heard anything."
130,00:06:59,00:07:02,I'm gonna go see if I can figure out where this started.
131,00:07:43,00:07:49,"(chuckling): Whoa! ""Crime Lab Nick Stokes!"" I see we're in between bad haircuts."
132,00:07:49,00:07:51,Drops.
133,00:07:51,00:07:53,Told you I'd see you later.
134,00:07:53,00:07:56,It's called criminal activity.
135,00:07:56,00:07:58,"Stand up and hold your hands up for me, please."
136,00:07:58,00:08:03,"Now, come on, Crime Lab, I thought we was old buddies."
137,00:08:03,00:08:08,"The only thing we have in common, Kellen, are the dead bodies that seem to keep piling up around you."
138,00:08:08,00:08:10,"Turn around, please."
139,00:08:10,00:08:12,"Well, first of all..."
140,00:08:12,00:08:14,I ain't never killed nobody in my life.
141,00:08:14,00:08:17,"Second, I don't have a record."
142,00:08:17,00:08:20,Never even done a day in jail.
143,00:08:20,00:08:24,"Well, you keep heading down this road and, unfortunately, that's where you're going to end up."
144,00:08:24,00:08:25,"Yeah, well..."
145,00:08:25,00:08:27,"this, this ain't me."
146,00:08:27,00:08:28,I'm not used to this.
147,00:08:28,00:08:32,"As a matter of fact, I don't even know what that is."
148,00:08:32,00:08:34,It's a test for gunshot residue.
149,00:08:34,00:08:36,Hands up.
150,00:08:36,00:08:38,"Oh, yeah, uh..."
151,00:08:38,00:08:40,the powder from a gun.
152,00:08:40,00:08:41,You ain't gonna find none of that.
153,00:08:41,00:08:43,Maybe not.
154,00:08:43,00:08:48,"Okay, now, I need you to remove all of your clothing, including your shoes."
155,00:08:48,00:08:53,"You can put these on for now and I'll come back to get them when you're done. No, thanks."
156,00:08:53,00:08:55,"Uh, I got one of my queens bringing me a suit."
157,00:08:55,00:08:57,I will not be throwing on these nasty ass scrubs.
158,00:08:58,00:09:00,You are covered in blood.
159,00:09:00,00:09:04,Your clothes are evidence now and I'm going to come back in here and I'm going to get them.
160,00:09:05,00:09:07,"If not, you're just going to be standing here in your underwear."
161,00:09:07,00:09:08,What underwear?
162,00:09:08,00:09:10,I don't wear drawers.
163,00:09:10,00:09:11,(wry laugh)
164,00:09:11,00:09:14,"This is not a compromise, Kellen."
165,00:09:15,00:09:20,You might want to close your eyes or turn around or something.
166,00:09:28,00:09:30,Come in.
167,00:09:30,00:09:33,"Come in slow, slow, slow."
168,00:09:33,00:09:34,"All right, stop."
169,00:11:07,00:11:16,"50 AE casings came back clean on IBIS, but Ballistics was able to pull type and caliber from the copper jacket fragments inside the limo."
170,00:11:16,00:11:19,Consistent with .50 caliber Desert Eagle handgun.
171,00:11:19,00:11:20,Yeah.
172,00:11:20,00:11:27,"Blood on the seats suggests that the victim was sitting here, on the left, with Drops somewhere to the right."
173,00:11:28,00:11:31,Six shots into the limo.
174,00:11:31,00:11:38,"Autopsy reports cause of death was single gunshot wound to the head with variable trajectory, so one of those was the kill shot."
175,00:11:38,00:11:41,"Yeah, it's just hard to say which one."
176,00:11:41,00:11:43,The crash tossed everything all over the place.
177,00:11:43,00:11:44,And it's basically one big mess now.
178,00:11:44,00:11:46,"Sounds like Drops's story is holding up, though."
179,00:11:46,00:11:48,Gentlemen.
180,00:11:48,00:11:49,Follow me.
181,00:11:50,00:11:56,"STOKES: There were two shots fired through the glass, but as you can see, different sizes, different calibers."
182,00:11:56,00:11:58,Big one's consistent with the .50.
183,00:11:58,00:12:02,"Yeah, but check out the beveling on the impacts."
184,00:12:02,00:12:07,"Um, based on the beveling, these shots were fired from opposite directions."
185,00:12:07,00:12:12,"GRISSOM: Tinting film is applied to the inside of a window, so the small-caliber round was fired from inside the limo."
186,00:12:12,00:12:17,"Well, I analyzed the radial cracks from both holes."
187,00:12:17,00:12:23,The cracks from the shot that was fired out was terminated by the cracks from the shot that was fired in.
188,00:12:30,00:12:33,Someone inside the limo had a gun.
189,00:12:33,00:12:36,"And, evidently, Drops wasn't telling us the whole story after all."
190,00:12:47,00:12:49,"DROPS: Look, I didn't lie, all right?"
191,00:12:49,00:12:51,I just left a couple of things out.
192,00:12:51,00:12:54,"Well, you want to fill in the blanks before I ship you for obstruction?"
193,00:12:55,00:12:56,We shot back; it's that simple.
194,00:12:56,00:12:57,We?
195,00:12:57,00:12:59,You both had guns?
196,00:12:59,00:13:00,"Nah, man, just one of us."
197,00:13:00,00:13:02,"Well, I bet I can guess which one."
198,00:13:02,00:13:06,'Cause you're the only person in the limo with a registered .38 revolver.
199,00:13:06,00:13:09,"(gunshot, tires squealing)"
200,00:13:09,00:13:11,"(gunshots, bullets ricocheting)"
201,00:13:12,00:13:15,"I guess you know that blood is a good way to wash off GSR, right?"
202,00:13:15,00:13:17,"Nah, my dude. Look, I ain't do no shooting."
203,00:13:17,00:13:20,"All right? Somebody jacked that piece off me, like, a year ago."
204,00:13:20,00:13:24,You're telling me that you didn't shoot a gun from inside the limo?
205,00:13:24,00:13:29,"You're blaming it on a dead guy, a dead guy who just happens to have the same gun as you."
206,00:13:29,00:13:30,"What can I say, man?"
207,00:13:30,00:13:33,.38's back in style.
208,00:13:33,00:13:34,"Besides, man, Champ always had heat."
209,00:13:34,00:13:35,Everybody know that.
210,00:13:35,00:13:36,He got my back.
211,00:13:37,00:13:38,"You know, I know everything about you, Kellen."
212,00:13:39,00:13:41,You're just a small-time street thug and drug dealer from Northtown.
213,00:13:41,00:13:44,"You got the nickname ""Drops"" 'cause when you sold the chronic, you made a lot of drops."
214,00:13:44,00:13:52,"Wow, and here I was thinking that I got that name based off my boxing skills, seeing as how I used to drop fools in the squared circle."
215,00:13:52,00:13:53,"I don't know, you're a little slow behind the jab."
216,00:13:54,00:13:56,And all you do is a lot of bobbing and weaving.
217,00:13:56,00:13:58,"So get me the gun, and I'll let you have your massage."
218,00:14:00,00:14:02,"I tossed it after the shooting, man."
219,00:14:02,00:14:05,"Look, CSI's been all over that area, they didn't find any guns."
220,00:14:05,00:14:09,"That's because a gun like that in a hood like that, that's rent money, baby."
221,00:14:09,00:14:10,"Excuse me, beautiful."
222,00:14:10,00:14:13,We're gonna wrap up these chicken wings and take them to go.
223,00:14:13,00:14:15,"Whoa, okay, easy now, Kojaks."
224,00:14:15,00:14:18,"No gun, no happy ending."
225,00:14:18,00:14:20,Come on.
226,00:14:20,00:14:23,Don't tell me you're tired of the field already.
227,00:14:24,00:14:26,"No, I had to catch up on my Perez Hilton."
228,00:14:26,00:14:28,"I take it you're not gonna pull a Sanders on us, then?"
229,00:14:28,00:14:33,"Let's see: Clean, friendly lab, bullet-strewn, urine-soaked street-- that's a tough call."
230,00:14:33,00:14:35,You have something for me?
231,00:14:36,00:14:37,"Oh, most definitely."
232,00:14:37,00:14:41,I I.D.'d the serial number on the piece of plastic Warrick found in the street.
233,00:14:41,00:14:42,Yeah?
234,00:14:42,00:14:43,It's a GMC seatbelt adjuster.
235,00:14:43,00:14:46,Keeps the shoulder harness webbing from rubbing on the neck.
236,00:14:47,00:14:49,Okay. You got make and model of that car?
237,00:14:49,00:14:51,HODGES: Sure do.
238,00:14:51,00:14:54,But I don't think it's gonna help you much.
239,00:14:54,00:14:56,Oh.
240,00:15:03,00:15:04,That's it.
241,00:15:10,00:15:18,"ROBBINS: She had atlanto-occipital dislocation, a basilar skull fracture and contre-coup injuries from bouncing her head on the ground."
242,00:15:18,00:15:20,C.O.D. is craniocerebral trauma.
243,00:15:20,00:15:22,And are those ligature marks?
244,00:15:22,00:15:24,They are.
245,00:15:24,00:15:26,The right wrist was broken.
246,00:15:26,00:15:27,Take a look at the shoulder.
247,00:15:27,00:15:30,The humeral head's in front of the usual articulation.
248,00:15:31,00:15:33,Completely dislocated.
249,00:15:33,00:15:34,She was dragged by her wrist.
250,00:15:34,00:15:37,We found a seatbelt adjuster at the scene.
251,00:15:37,00:15:39,Maybe she was dragged by a seatbelt.
252,00:15:39,00:15:40,(screaming)
253,00:15:43,00:15:46,"Whatever it was, the dragging went on a while."
254,00:15:46,00:15:50,"Abrasions on her elbows, ribs, and knee caps go down to the bone."
255,00:15:54,00:15:56,Her eyes.
256,00:15:56,00:15:57,What about them?
257,00:15:57,00:15:58,They're the wrong color.
258,00:15:58,00:15:59,They were green.
259,00:15:59,00:16:00,You mean these?
260,00:16:02,00:16:04,Green contacts.
261,00:16:16,00:16:21,"BROWN: I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Gentry, but we could really use your help."
262,00:16:21,00:16:26,Is there anyone in this neighborhood that your daughter might have been going to see last night?
263,00:16:26,00:16:28,(sobbing)
264,00:16:28,00:16:30,(cell phone ringing)
265,00:16:30,00:16:33,Excuse me.
266,00:16:36,00:16:38,"Hey, Cath."
267,00:16:40,00:16:44,Are you serious?
268,00:16:44,00:16:45,"You're kidding, right?"
269,00:16:45,00:16:49,I'm actually with the mother right now.
270,00:16:49,00:16:50,I'll handle it.
271,00:16:50,00:16:51,I'm sorry.
272,00:16:51,00:16:53,I don't know why Melissa would have...
273,00:16:53,00:16:55,"Ma'am, your daughter's alive."
274,00:16:55,00:16:58,What?
275,00:16:58,00:17:00,We made a mistake.
276,00:17:00,00:17:02,The victim that we found was carrying your daughter's I.D.
277,00:17:02,00:17:04,Are you sure?
278,00:17:04,00:17:07,"Yes. She just spoke with my supervisor, she's fine."
279,00:17:07,00:17:09,(laughing)
280,00:17:09,00:17:11,It's a miracle.
281,00:17:11,00:17:12,"Oh, thank God."
282,00:17:12,00:17:14,(sobbing): It's a miracle!
283,00:17:17,00:17:19,All right.
284,00:17:20,00:17:22,There's just one thing.
285,00:17:22,00:17:25,We still need to identify the victim.
286,00:17:27,00:17:31,Could you tell me if you recognize this girl?
287,00:17:33,00:17:35,That's Simone.
288,00:17:35,00:17:37,"(sobbing): Oh, no."
289,00:17:37,00:17:41,That's Simone Molinez.
290,00:17:41,00:17:43,That's my daughter's best friend.
291,00:17:43,00:17:44,(sobbing): Oh...
292,00:17:46,00:17:49,There were no drugs or alcohol in the limo driver's system.
293,00:17:49,00:17:51,Really?
294,00:17:51,00:17:52,What about Drops?
295,00:17:52,00:17:55,Also clean. As was your head shot vic.
296,00:17:55,00:17:57,Club scene's getting really tame these days.
297,00:17:57,00:17:58,There's got to be something on the rolled-up hundred.
298,00:17:58,00:18:03,"It's positive for cocaine, along with every Benjamin in the country."
299,00:18:03,00:18:06,But no coke in the driver or the passengers?
300,00:18:06,00:18:09,That doesn't make any sense.
301,00:18:32,00:18:39,"You know, if you're still having trouble coming to terms with the fact that this is no longer your lab, I suggest counseling."
302,00:18:39,00:18:41,"I would like you to run this for me, please."
303,00:18:41,00:18:43,Okay.
304,00:18:43,00:18:45,Hmm. Boogers on a nose straw.
305,00:18:45,00:18:47,Yep.
306,00:18:47,00:18:51,"Well, in recognition of your years of previous service, I will make it a priority."
307,00:18:51,00:18:52,Thank you.
308,00:18:52,00:18:54,You're welcome.
309,00:18:57,00:19:01,I gave Simone my license a couple of months ago.
310,00:19:01,00:19:08,"She was always getting her fakes snatched by bouncers, so I gave her my expired one."
311,00:19:08,00:19:11,Bouncers only ever look at the birth date.
312,00:19:11,00:19:13,We look alike.
313,00:19:13,00:19:18,"Kind of, in ways, like her nose and..."
314,00:19:18,00:19:22,parts of her chin and cheeks.
315,00:19:22,00:19:25,And we both have nice butts.
316,00:19:25,00:19:29,But... that's not on a license.
317,00:19:29,00:19:32,Do you know anyone who'd want to hurt Simone?
318,00:19:34,00:19:35,No way.
319,00:19:36,00:19:39,"She was so nice, super cool..."
320,00:19:39,00:19:41,all about fun.
321,00:19:41,00:19:43,Any guys involved?
322,00:19:43,00:19:45,Yeah.
323,00:19:45,00:19:47,Mostly guys.
324,00:19:47,00:19:48,Guys with money.
325,00:19:48,00:19:50,Like who?
326,00:19:50,00:19:51,I never met any of them.
327,00:19:51,00:19:53,They weren't long-term things.
328,00:19:53,00:19:55,She would just go out with them to party.
329,00:19:55,00:19:57,She have sex with these guys?
330,00:19:57,00:19:59,"No, no sex."
331,00:19:59,00:20:03,She would just use them to get drunk and hang out at penthouses.
332,00:20:03,00:20:04,Where was Simone last night?
333,00:20:04,00:20:11,"I don't know, but she always starts off her night at the same place: The Gold Square on Sunset."
334,00:20:11,00:20:12,That place is a dive.
335,00:20:13,00:20:15,That's not the kind of place to find rich guys.
336,00:20:15,00:20:18,It was kind of a confidence builder for her.
337,00:20:18,00:20:20,Simone was a star in there.
338,00:20:20,00:20:24,She'd always come out with at least a couple numbers.
339,00:20:24,00:20:29,"CURTIS: Gold Square Bar, gold wad of tissue in her purse-- figured it was worth checking out."
340,00:20:29,00:20:31,Looks like a bar napkin.
341,00:20:31,00:20:34,"Yeah, that's been shaped, rolled and twisted."
342,00:20:34,00:20:37,Las Vegas origami.
343,00:20:38,00:20:39,Pretty corny.
344,00:20:39,00:20:41,Probably work on me.
345,00:20:41,00:20:42,"(chuckles): That bad, huh?"
346,00:20:42,00:20:44,(chuckles)
347,00:20:44,00:20:46,Here we are.
348,00:20:48,00:20:53,"""Carey."" Looks like this Carey was hitting on the vic."
349,00:20:53,00:20:55,Maybe in more ways than one.
350,00:21:14,00:21:16,(footsteps approaching)
351,00:21:19,00:21:20,Hey.
352,00:21:20,00:21:22,"Um, I got your DNA results."
353,00:21:22,00:21:24,"Yeah, and?"
354,00:21:24,00:21:26,"Well, there were two donors on the nose straw."
355,00:21:26,00:21:29,There was one unknown female and one half-known male.
356,00:21:29,00:21:30,So a sibling match?
357,00:21:31,00:21:33,Yeah.
358,00:21:33,00:21:36,"Greg, the male is the brother of Demitrius James."
359,00:21:40,00:21:41,SANDERS: One guy decided not to run away.
360,00:21:41,00:21:46,He picked up a rock and started coming at me with it.
361,00:21:46,00:21:48,"(Marla wailing, sobbing)"
362,00:21:48,00:21:51,"MARLA JAMES: You didn't run over a mob, you ran over one boy!"
363,00:21:51,00:21:52,My boy!
364,00:21:53,00:21:56,"AARON JAMES: How tough you feel when your not in your big SUV, huh?"
365,00:21:56,00:21:59,"Asked you a question, killer."
366,00:21:59,00:22:01,I asked you a question!
367,00:22:06,00:22:09,GRISSOM: This image was captured on a cell phone at the scene.
368,00:22:09,00:22:13,We believe that that is Aaron James.
369,00:22:13,00:22:14,That fuzzy blob?
370,00:22:14,00:22:17,We also found evidence of Aaron James inside the limo.
371,00:22:18,00:22:20,"Well, I hope it's better than this photo."
372,00:22:20,00:22:24,"It's DNA, along with traces of cocaine on a rolled-up $100 bill."
373,00:22:24,00:22:26,Which doesn't place him in the limo.
374,00:22:26,00:22:28,That bill could have been brought in there by anyone.
375,00:22:28,00:22:31,We found a pattern in the blood on the seat next to the vic's.
376,00:22:31,00:22:39,"It doesn't match the clothes from the limo driver or Drops', so there was at least one other passenger in that limo, and we need to question Aaron James."
377,00:22:39,00:22:45,This city just paid Aaron James and his mother $2.5 million because you ran his brother over.
378,00:22:45,00:22:48,Are you trying to find a way to give them more money?
379,00:22:48,00:22:53,"I'm just trying to do my job. You want to talk to Aaron James, give me more than snot on a bill, and a dot on a crummy photo."
380,00:22:53,00:22:56,This is a PR nightmare in the making.
381,00:22:56,00:22:57,We still don't have a murder weapon.
382,00:22:57,00:22:59,Aaron James could be destroying evidence right now.
383,00:22:59,00:23:01,"All right, first of all, stop talking."
384,00:23:01,00:23:02,You're off the case.
385,00:23:02,00:23:04,Everything he touched gets reprocessed.
386,00:23:04,00:23:06,There's nothing wrong with my work. Okay. I know that.
387,00:23:06,00:23:08,"It's just standard procedure. Oh, procedure."
388,00:23:08,00:23:11,"Open your mouth one more time, and you're on suspension."
389,00:23:11,00:23:14,I'm trying to avoid a harassment suit here.
390,00:23:14,00:23:15,This is cover-our-ass time.
391,00:23:17,00:23:19,Keep me apprised.
392,00:23:19,00:23:24,This would have been so much easier if you had been the black guy.
393,00:23:28,00:23:30,We're looking for Carey Corville.
394,00:23:31,00:23:34,"That's me, Bob."
395,00:23:36,00:23:39,M... Hottest cops I've ever seen.
396,00:23:39,00:23:42,"Yeah, might be the hottest chicks I've seen all week."
397,00:23:42,00:23:44,"You guys are here to get me, take me away."
398,00:23:44,00:23:45,Pat him down.
399,00:23:46,00:23:49,Am I under arrest for something?
400,00:23:49,00:23:51,"Yeah, that depends."
401,00:23:51,00:23:53,This your idea of romance?
402,00:23:54,00:23:56,Can't really arrest me for that.
403,00:23:57,00:24:01,We found it in Simone Molinez's purse.
404,00:24:01,00:24:03,"She kept that, for real?"
405,00:24:03,00:24:05,"Oh, it's on."
406,00:24:05,00:24:07,What are you guys doing with it?
407,00:24:07,00:24:08,She's dead.
408,00:24:11,00:24:12,Oh.
409,00:24:12,00:24:15,"Well, listen, I don't know nothing about none of that."
410,00:24:15,00:24:18,Sh-She was breathing when I left her.
411,00:24:18,00:24:21,"(loud chatter, music playing)"
412,00:24:21,00:24:23,That's sweet.
413,00:24:24,00:24:26,But I have a boyfriend.
414,00:24:27,00:24:29,So you say.
415,00:24:29,00:24:31,Come on.
416,00:24:31,00:24:33,I'm not that hard up.
417,00:24:33,00:24:36,"Look, she didn't like me."
418,00:24:36,00:24:37,So what?
419,00:24:37,00:24:39,On to the next who will.
420,00:24:39,00:24:41,You've got a GMC truck?
421,00:24:41,00:24:43,Where is it?
422,00:25:08,00:25:10,(sniffing)
423,00:25:12,00:25:14,Disinfectant.
424,00:25:18,00:25:22,Seat's damp.
425,00:25:30,00:25:34,"WILLOWS: Hey, Carey, there's blood in your car."
426,00:25:34,00:25:36,"Yeah, it's, uh, my boy, Scotty."
427,00:25:36,00:25:37,He had a nosebleed.
428,00:25:37,00:25:38,Scotty who?
429,00:25:38,00:25:39,Scotty Brittington?
430,00:25:39,00:25:44,"WILLOWS: Well, it's a hell of a lot of blood for a nosebleed."
431,00:25:44,00:25:47,Looks more consistent with the body of a bloody girl.
432,00:25:47,00:25:49,I don't know what you're talking about.
433,00:25:49,00:25:51,CURTIS: Where would we find your boy Scotty?
434,00:25:52,00:25:55,I don't know. He's kind of hard to get a hold of easy.
435,00:25:55,00:25:56,Address and phone.
436,00:25:56,00:25:59,We're going to see what your boy has to say about this blood.
437,00:25:59,00:26:02,"Until then, you're coming with us."
438,00:26:11,00:26:13,(phone ringing)
439,00:26:13,00:26:15,(phone beeps on)
440,00:26:15,00:26:17,This is Catherine.
441,00:26:17,00:26:18,CURTIS: It's me.
442,00:26:18,00:26:23,"Scott Brittington wasn't at any of his usual haunts, so I checked the hospitals, and guess what?"
443,00:26:24,00:26:27,He was admitted last night with a severe puncture wound to his shoulder.
444,00:26:27,00:26:32,"He told the staff it was a work injury, but during surgery, they extracted a bullet fragment."
445,00:26:32,00:26:34,Interesting line of work.
446,00:26:34,00:26:40,"Doc thinks someone tried to dig it out to avoid police notification, which actually made it a lot worse."
447,00:26:40,00:26:43,(screaming)
448,00:26:44,00:26:46,"Dude, it's..."
449,00:26:46,00:26:47,Keep going.
450,00:26:48,00:26:50,I can't go to the hospital with a bullet in me.
451,00:26:50,00:26:51,Cops'll be all over us.
452,00:26:51,00:26:53,(squishing) (screaming)
453,00:26:53,00:26:55,"It's all right, man. I got it, I got it."
454,00:26:55,00:26:57,(panting)
455,00:26:57,00:27:00,Needle-nose pliers aren't exactly a fine surgical tool.
456,00:27:00,00:27:02,"CURTIS: Yeah, that's for sure."
457,00:27:02,00:27:04,WILLOWS: You talk to Scott?
458,00:27:04,00:27:07,"Well, I'm on my way to his room right now."
459,00:27:07,00:27:11,"WILLOWS: If he's anything like his friend, I'll sure he'll give you plenty of attitude."
460,00:27:11,00:27:12,Let me know what he has to say.
461,00:27:12,00:27:14,"DOCTOR: All right, let's call it, people."
462,00:27:14,00:27:16,We've done what we could.
463,00:27:16,00:27:18,I don't think it's going to be much.
464,00:27:22,00:27:24,(computer beeping)
465,00:27:30,00:27:32,(computer beeping)
466,00:27:42,00:27:45,(computer beeping)
467,00:27:45,00:27:47,(sighs)
468,00:27:49,00:27:52,(beeps)
469,00:27:53,00:27:55,(beeps)
470,00:27:55,00:28:00,WILLOWS: A .38 fragment recovered from a suspect in my homicide matched a .38 bullet that Greg found near the strip club drive-by.
471,00:28:00,00:28:05,SIDLE: So the guys in the GMC truck got into a shoot-out with the guys in the limo.
472,00:28:05,00:28:08,(tires squealing)
473,00:28:09,00:28:11,(gunfire)
474,00:28:12,00:28:13,(screaming)
475,00:28:13,00:28:16,Tie score-- one dead on each side.
476,00:28:16,00:28:17,Over what?
477,00:28:17,00:28:19,Why were these guys shooting each other up?
478,00:28:19,00:28:21,It's got to be about the girl.
479,00:28:21,00:28:27,"Her DNA matched the unknown female contribution on the hundred dollar bill, so, she was in the limo."
480,00:28:27,00:28:30,But that bill doesn't put her in there any more than it does Aaron.
481,00:28:30,00:28:33,"No, but it proves she was with Aaron at some point in the night."
482,00:28:34,00:28:35,Wait a minute.
483,00:28:35,00:28:37,Why would Simone even be with those guys?
484,00:28:37,00:28:38,Because of Drops.
485,00:28:38,00:28:41,"He knows everybody in the club scene, especially the party girls."
486,00:28:41,00:28:42,He could have picked her up anywhere.
487,00:28:42,00:28:45,Simone blows off the broke guys to party with the rich guys.
488,00:28:45,00:28:48,"The broke guys feel dissed, so they track down the limo and retaliate."
489,00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah. Yeah.
490,00:28:49,00:28:53,"And somewhere in between, Simone just gets... tossed."
491,00:28:53,00:28:55,"All right, how are we going to prove any of this?"
492,00:28:55,00:28:58,"I mean, we're not going to get any answers from the suspect in the truck."
493,00:28:58,00:29:00,He's lawyered up.
494,00:29:00,00:29:01,So is Drops.
495,00:29:01,00:29:03,And the Undersheriff isn't letting anyone talk to Aaron.
496,00:29:03,00:29:07,What about the seat belt adjuster you found?
497,00:29:07,00:29:08,No match to the truck.
498,00:29:08,00:29:10,Doesn't even have seat belt adjusters.
499,00:29:10,00:29:11,What about the limo?
500,00:29:11,00:29:13,SIDLE: It's not a GMC.
501,00:29:13,00:29:14,It's a Lincoln Continental.
502,00:29:14,00:29:18,"Yeah, but maybe not entirely."
503,00:29:18,00:29:20,Stretch limos are custom-made.
504,00:29:20,00:29:27,"You take a Lincoln Continental, cut it apart, stretch it with whatever parts you have available: Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, doesn't matter."
505,00:29:40,00:29:42,Looks like the same belt adjuster.
506,00:29:42,00:29:44,This one's missing.
507,00:29:47,00:29:50,This blood has to be from the shooting.
508,00:29:52,00:29:56,This is from something else.
509,00:29:56,00:29:59,There shouldn't be blood on this part of the seat belt.
510,00:29:59,00:30:02,Think the Undersheriff will let us talk to Aaron now?
511,00:30:02,00:30:09,"If the DNA matches Simone Molinez's, anyone that was in this limo is up for murder."
512,00:30:09,00:30:12,"The, uh, Undersheriff won't have a choice."
513,00:30:12,00:30:15,OFFICER MITCHELL: From the hood to the hills.
514,00:30:15,00:30:17,Didn't take him long to spend the taxpayers' money.
515,00:30:17,00:30:19,"CURTIS: Hey, knock it off."
516,00:30:20,00:30:23,You need to look in the fridge. Mrs. James?
517,00:30:23,00:30:25,"(music playing) Oh, hell, no."
518,00:30:25,00:30:26,I got company.
519,00:30:26,00:30:28,We have a warrant to search the premises.
520,00:30:28,00:30:31,A warrant? A warrant for what?!
521,00:30:31,00:30:32,We also need to speak to Aaron.
522,00:30:32,00:30:35,"Oh, we're not talking to nobody."
523,00:30:35,00:30:37,This is harassment!
524,00:30:38,00:30:41,That could be considered assaulting an officer.
525,00:30:41,00:30:43,Let's not make this harder than it has to be.
526,00:30:45,00:30:50,Somebody get me a phone!
527,00:30:50,00:30:52,"All right, ten ball, corner pocket."
528,00:30:52,00:30:54,Mr. James?
529,00:30:56,00:30:58,We need to talk to you down at the station.
530,00:31:05,00:31:07,You're not under arrest.
531,00:31:07,00:31:08,We just want to talk.
532,00:31:09,00:31:11,"Yeah, right."
533,00:31:20,00:31:22,I hear soda water works better.
534,00:31:24,00:31:27,What'd work better is if I took it out and shot it.
535,00:31:27,00:31:30,So long as I don't see it on the 11:00 news. (chuckles)
536,00:31:32,00:31:34,"The James kid, he lawyered up? Yeah."
537,00:31:34,00:31:36,"Yeah, his attorney's on his way."
538,00:31:36,00:31:38,You holding a press conference?
539,00:31:38,00:31:41,"Yeah, I'm on my way there now."
540,00:31:41,00:31:42,How do I look?
541,00:31:42,00:31:44,Like fresh meat.
542,00:31:45,00:31:48,Oh. Hope I hold my temper as well as you.
543,00:31:48,00:31:50,You've got a big future in this department.
544,00:31:50,00:31:53,Send the dry cleaning bill to my office.
545,00:32:01,00:32:06,"SIDLE: I checked the mom's room and the guest rooms, no sign of any weapons, but..."
546,00:32:07,00:32:09,I did find these in the laundry room.
547,00:32:09,00:32:11,Look familiar?
548,00:32:15,00:32:17,Yeah. Any trace of blood?
549,00:32:17,00:32:20,Nothing obvious. They were just washed.
550,00:32:20,00:32:21,(sniffs) They smell like bleach.
551,00:32:21,00:32:25,"Great. What about the, uh, the hoodie in that cell phone picture?"
552,00:32:25,00:32:26,It looked like Aaron was wearing one.
553,00:32:26,00:32:29,"Yeah, it's still wet. Aaron wears his clothes baggy."
554,00:32:29,00:32:31,He probably keeps them out of the dryer so they won't shrink.
555,00:32:46,00:32:48,Looks like the little hood left us something.
556,00:32:48,00:32:49,(glass breaking)
557,00:32:54,00:32:56,ATTORNEY: You're right.
558,00:32:56,00:33:01,My client is guilty of partying in Las Vegas.
559,00:33:01,00:33:05,"But with this de minimusamount, you wouldn't be able to hold him for possession."
560,00:33:06,00:33:08,Those jeans? Come on.
561,00:33:09,00:33:13,You'd probably find that same pattern on at least a couple thousand asses in this town.
562,00:33:13,00:33:17,There's nothing here that places my client in that limo at the time of the shooting.
563,00:33:17,00:33:20,How about this?
564,00:33:24,00:33:27,CURTIS: A piece of Champ Landley's skull in the hood of your sweater.
565,00:33:29,00:33:31,I'd say you were definitely there.
566,00:33:36,00:33:40,"ATTORNEY: Look, scared kid makes a couple of mistakes."
567,00:33:40,00:33:41,"It's peer pressure, all right?"
568,00:33:41,00:33:43,"It's a misdemeanor, at best."
569,00:33:43,00:33:47,You want to put LVPD through PR hell for that? CURTIS: No.
570,00:33:48,00:33:49,Not just that.
571,00:33:49,00:33:54,Simone Molinez was dragged to death from your limo before the shoot-out.
572,00:33:54,00:33:58,Aaron was in the car when she was being dragged.
573,00:33:58,00:34:00,I'd say that makes him a prime suspect.
574,00:34:01,00:34:03,"No, no, no, hold it, hold it."
575,00:34:03,00:34:04,I don't know this girl.
576,00:34:04,00:34:06,"Okay, she came up to Drops at the Gold Square."
577,00:34:06,00:34:07,"Aaron, don't say... No, hold up, man."
578,00:34:07,00:34:09,I didn't kill anybody.
579,00:34:09,00:34:12,What's a guy like Drops doing at a dump like the Gold Square?
580,00:34:12,00:34:14,Drops grew up in that 'hood.
581,00:34:14,00:34:16,"Guess he, uh..."
582,00:34:16,00:34:18,wanted to claim his old territory.
583,00:34:20,00:34:22,AARON: We own that place.
584,00:34:22,00:34:25,Picking up a girl in there was like stealing.
585,00:34:26,00:34:28,Drops had been trying to open up his own club.
586,00:34:28,00:34:30,Asked me to invest.
587,00:34:30,00:34:36,"Before I got my money, guy like Drops wouldn't have said, ""What up,"" to me, let alone ask me out to talk business."
588,00:34:36,00:34:38,I felt like a big shot. What's the big deal?
589,00:34:38,00:34:43,We think it's that big shot attitude that's exactly what got you shot.
590,00:34:51,00:34:56,"CURTIS: Taking that girl out of the Gold Square, you pissed off a couple of locals."
591,00:34:56,00:35:00,Everyone knows Drops ends his nights at the strip club.
592,00:35:01,00:35:02,They were waiting for you.
593,00:35:02,00:35:05,"Look, I had nothing to do with that."
594,00:35:05,00:35:07,And I definitely didn't kick her out of that limo.
595,00:35:07,00:35:09,CURTIS: So who did then?
596,00:35:09,00:35:14,"ATTORNEY: Aaron, unless you want to go to jail, son, don't say another word."
597,00:35:14,00:35:15,You observed the interview?
598,00:35:15,00:35:17,"If the Undersheriff had seen you, he would've gone ballistic."
599,00:35:17,00:35:19,"Well, I'm still off the case."
600,00:35:19,00:35:25,"Besides, I just happened to be listening, and I heard Aaron say that he didn't kick the girl out of the limo."
601,00:35:26,00:35:27,You want me to check the body?
602,00:35:27,00:35:32,"Well, bruises get more distinguished as a body decomposes, so just see if there's anything we missed."
603,00:35:32,00:35:34,MARLA: That's the one I want to talk to. I'm on it.
604,00:35:34,00:35:36,"RECEPTIONIST: Miss, excuse me. You're not allowed back there!"
605,00:35:37,00:35:40,"Taking one of my boys wasn't good enough for you, was it?"
606,00:35:40,00:35:41,Now you've got to take both?
607,00:35:41,00:35:43,What did we ever do to you?
608,00:35:43,00:35:46,"Mrs. James, I don't have anything against you or your family. Then what is it?"
609,00:35:46,00:35:48,Is it about the money?
610,00:35:48,00:35:49,Then take it!
611,00:35:49,00:35:51,I just want my boy back!
612,00:35:51,00:35:52,"Mrs. James, you need to calm down..."
613,00:35:52,00:35:53,I'm not talking to you!
614,00:35:53,00:35:55,"Well, you're going to get yourself into trouble here."
615,00:35:55,00:35:56,OFFICER: Ma'am...
616,00:35:56,00:35:57,You're going to have to leave.
617,00:35:57,00:36:01,Protecting the nice white boy from the mean black lady.
618,00:36:01,00:36:02,You've got to help me.
619,00:36:02,00:36:05,You owe me. You owe me!
620,00:36:07,00:36:09,What do I owe you?
621,00:36:09,00:36:10,(chuckles)
622,00:36:10,00:36:12,"Yeah, like you don't know."
623,00:36:12,00:36:16,I'll tell you what I know: I know that Demitrius was a killer.
624,00:36:16,00:36:20,And Aaron-- Aaron made the decision to hang out with Drops.
625,00:36:20,00:36:24,"He made the decision to do drugs, and to bring that girl into the limo."
626,00:36:25,00:36:26,That's not onme.
627,00:36:26,00:36:30,"It's on him, and you."
628,00:36:39,00:36:42,Aaron is all I have left.
629,00:37:15,00:37:17,(camera beeps)
630,00:37:17,00:37:23,BRASS: This bruise on Simone Molinez's body matches the heel of your buddy Champ's dress shoe.
631,00:37:27,00:37:30,"Man, forensics be jammin' a brother up."
632,00:37:30,00:37:32,No doubt. And you saw him do it.
633,00:37:32,00:37:36,"Look, he was just trying to show a potential investor a good time, that's all."
634,00:37:36,00:37:38,The boy got a short fuse.
635,00:37:38,00:37:40,All right. Whatever.
636,00:37:40,00:37:42,Why don't you really hook up my man?
637,00:37:42,00:37:45,"Champ, come on, man."
638,00:37:45,00:37:47,"What's wrong with you, man? She's a lady."
639,00:37:47,00:37:48,Let me out the car!
640,00:37:48,00:37:50,"Oh, you want out?"
641,00:37:52,00:37:53,Get out.
642,00:37:54,00:37:56,Tell the driver to stop.
643,00:37:56,00:37:57,We're in a hurry!
644,00:37:57,00:37:58,"You want out, you get out now!"
645,00:37:59,00:38:00,No!
646,00:38:00,00:38:02,(screaming) Hey!
647,00:38:02,00:38:05,"So, what, he pushed her out of the car because she wouldn't have sex with Aaron?"
648,00:38:05,00:38:07,Champ thought it was a bad look.
649,00:38:07,00:38:09,Bad? Bad for what?
650,00:38:09,00:38:11,Champ gets a bonus when business is good.
651,00:38:11,00:38:16,"You got booze, bling, girls, guns and drugs in a limo."
652,00:38:16,00:38:18,Would you call that doing legitimate business?
653,00:38:18,00:38:19,Yeah.
654,00:38:19,00:38:20,"So, um..."
655,00:38:20,00:38:24,what's a few scrapes and bruises on this girl got to do with me?
656,00:38:24,00:38:31,"Yeah, a few scrapes and bruises, a broken wrist dislocated shoulder, broken neck-- add it up: it equals death."
657,00:38:31,00:38:33,"Death? Wait a minute, no way."
658,00:38:33,00:38:37,"See, first of all, that limo was turtlestepping' it down the block. It's like fallin' off a bike."
659,00:38:37,00:38:39,"Yeah, maybe so, if she wasn't tangled up in the seat belt."
660,00:38:39,00:38:41,"What, you didn't hear her dragging on the street?"
661,00:38:42,00:38:43,The speakers were on blast.
662,00:38:44,00:38:46,I couldn't even hear my cell phone and that was on vibrate.
663,00:38:46,00:38:49,My client has corroborated your evidence.
664,00:38:49,00:38:50,Are we free to go?
665,00:38:50,00:38:53,What? No!
666,00:38:54,00:38:56,I'm charging you with the murder of Scott Brittington.
667,00:38:57,00:38:58,Scott... Who?
668,00:38:58,00:39:00,The guy you shot.
669,00:39:00,00:39:02,"Okay, we already went over that."
670,00:39:02,00:39:03,Champ was the shooter.
671,00:39:03,00:39:05,"Yeah, so you say."
672,00:39:05,00:39:12,"But you're the only one in the limo with a registered .38. And you didn't toss that gun after you used it, you gave it to Aaron."
673,00:39:12,00:39:16,"DROPS: Trust me, son, you don't want to be here when the cops come, okay?"
674,00:39:16,00:39:18,"Here, take the ratchet, and make it disappear."
675,00:39:18,00:39:19,Take the ratchet!
676,00:39:19,00:39:21,Don't worry about it; I got you covered.
677,00:39:22,00:39:30,"BRASS: Aaron leaves the scene with your murder weapon, and you take his spot like he was never there."
678,00:39:30,00:39:34,"Captain Brass, I've seen the ballistics report."
679,00:39:34,00:39:39,The shots fired from inside the limo were fired second.
680,00:39:39,00:39:41,That's textbook self-defense.
681,00:39:45,00:39:49,"""Textbook self-defense."" Told you, forensics be jammin' a brother up."
682,00:39:49,00:39:51,I'll take my chances with the jury.
683,00:39:51,00:39:54,I'm going to see your arms behind your back sooner than you think.
684,00:39:54,00:39:56,Counselor.
685,00:39:58,00:40:01,(door opens and closes)
686,00:40:01,00:40:03,And all this time I thought I was paying you too much.
687,00:40:03,00:40:05,Give me some.
688,00:40:14,00:40:19,The DA tells me you requested he go easy on Aaron James.
689,00:40:19,00:40:21,Yeah.
690,00:40:22,00:40:24,He's getting a suspended sentence.
691,00:40:24,00:40:26,Released on his own recognizance.
