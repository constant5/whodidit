0	00:00:04	00:00:06	Move, keep moving.
1	00:00:25	00:00:27	All right. Noses to the wall!
2	00:00:27	00:00:30	All right, let's step to the wall.
3	00:00:36	00:00:37	What you looking at, Beaner?
4	00:00:37	00:00:39	One ugly-ass white bitch.
5	00:00:41	00:00:44	Get back up against the wall!
6	00:00:44	00:00:47	This is Officer Malone on the North Corridor. Inmate 415.
7	00:00:47	00:00:49	Request immediate backup.
8	00:00:49	00:00:50	Get down or you're going in the hole!
9	00:00:50	00:00:52	Move, move!
10	00:01:00	00:01:03	Hands on the wall!
11	00:01:03	00:01:05	You heard me?!
12	00:01:08	00:01:10	CSIs coming in.
13	00:01:21	00:01:23	I hate that sound.
14	00:01:23	00:01:29	You guys might want to take your jackets and turn them inside out. Half these guys are in here 'cause of you.
15	00:01:29	00:01:33	Let them take a good, long look, then.
16	00:01:33	00:01:35	I'm good.
17	00:01:51	00:01:55	Yeah, we got 'em in full lockdown, Clark County.
18	00:01:59	00:02:01	Jim. Hey.
19	00:02:01	00:02:03	What's the story? How'd it happen?
20	00:02:03	00:02:10	A corrections officer was walking a bunch of the Aryan Brotherhood by another bunch of not very Aryan brothers.
21	00:02:10	00:02:11	Never a good idea.
22	00:02:11	00:02:15	So, collateral damage? Wrong place, wrong time, or what?
23	00:02:15	00:02:18	Maybe, maybe not. Guy's a cop.
24	00:02:18	00:02:19	Vance Tolsom.
25	00:02:19	00:02:23	Brime County Deputy. He and I worked a bunch of cases back in the day.
26	00:02:23	00:02:25	Guy was a son of a bitch.
27	00:02:25	00:02:28	He had a short fuse, and he didn't take crap from anybody.
28	00:02:28	00:02:29	Well, he was stabbed multiple times.
29	00:02:29	00:02:31	Somebody really wanted this guy dead.
30	00:02:31	00:02:33	How'd he end up in prison in the first place?
31	00:02:33	00:02:35	He killed his wife Anne-Marie.
32	00:02:35	00:02:38	She was a cop, too.
33	00:02:38	00:02:42	When she got out of the Academy, I was her T.O.
34	00:02:42	00:02:44	What was an ex-cop doing in general population ward?
35	00:02:44	00:02:46	In keep-away for the first six months.
36	00:02:46	00:02:50	Bitching about going nuts, said he was willing to take his chances.
37	00:02:50	00:02:52	Mixed in pretty well for the past three years.
38	00:02:52	00:02:53	Too bad.
39	00:02:53	00:02:55	Vance was going to get a new trial.
40	00:02:55	00:02:58	Vance always bragged how he was bulletproof.
41	00:02:58	00:03:01	Well, he wasn't stab proof. Medical tape on the handle.
42	00:03:01	00:03:03	It's going to be difficult to get prints off that.
43	00:03:03	00:03:05	We got shoe impressions in the blood.
44	00:03:05	00:03:07	And the blood on their jumps should tell us something.
45	00:03:07	00:03:09	Mm-hmm. Listen up!
46	00:03:09	00:03:12	I want your sneakers! I want your jumps!
47	00:03:12	00:03:13	I want your DNA!
48	00:03:13	00:03:14	I want to see your hands!
49	00:03:14	00:03:16	I want to see your eyes!
50	00:03:16	00:03:18	This man you killed was a cop!
51	00:03:18	00:03:20	So there will be consequences!
52	00:03:20	00:03:22	Prison will not protect you!
53	00:04:02	00:04:04	Okay, open up.
54	00:04:04	00:04:06	Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm already in your database.
55	00:04:06	00:04:08	At least twice.
56	00:04:08	00:04:09	But it wasn't me.
57	00:04:09	00:04:14	That's why I'm going to collect your DNA and swab that blood off your hands, give you a fair shake this time. What do you say?
58	00:04:14	00:04:16	Yeah, thanks.
59	00:04:16	00:04:17	Hey.
60	00:04:17	00:04:19	Hey, hey.
61	00:04:19	00:04:20	Just leave your hands alone.
62	00:04:20	00:04:24	You'll get a chance to clean them up after I'm done.
63	00:04:24	00:04:27	Cut 'em off.
64	00:04:29	00:04:30	Take off your shirt.
65	00:04:32	00:04:34	Don't make me ask you again. Take it off.
66	00:04:42	00:04:44	You like what you see?
67	00:04:44	00:04:46	Hmm?
68	00:04:46	00:04:48	Take off your pants, Adolf, and I'll tell you.
69	00:04:49	00:04:52	You want some help?!
70	00:04:52	00:04:53	22...
71	00:04:53	00:04:57	23, 24, 25...
72	00:04:57	00:05:00	26 and 27.
73	00:05:00	00:05:07	Final count is 27 sharp force injuries to the upper torso and neck region.
74	00:05:07	00:05:09	Prison is an ugly place to get killed.
75	00:05:09	00:05:17	I will be sure to put that in my report It Sucks.
76	00:05:17	00:05:21	I'm just saying that lack of access to real weapons leads to some unnecessary roughness.
77	00:05:22	00:05:26	You just missed David's elegy on prison life.
78	00:05:26	00:05:28	I'll have to wait for the CD, I guess. Hmm.
79	00:05:28	00:05:30	Oh, Vance.
80	00:05:30	00:05:33	Used to be a good-looking guy.
81	00:05:33	00:05:34	Charming.
82	00:05:34	00:05:36	Not someone you'd want to cross, though.
83	00:05:36	00:05:38	So what have you got?
84	00:05:38	00:05:39	Well, C.O.D. is obvious.
85	00:05:39	00:05:42	Exsanguination due to multiple sharp force injuries.
86	00:05:42	00:05:45	None deeper than two inches.
87	00:05:45	00:05:48	Left and right jugular-carotid complex are pretty much shredded.
88	00:05:48	00:05:52	So the assailant should be covered in blood.
89	00:05:53	00:05:58	It's a roughly triangular-shaped piece of metal, sharpened to a point.
90	00:06:04	00:06:08	Wounds are consistent with a right-handed assailant.
91	00:07:06	00:07:09	Find anything interesting?
92	00:07:09	00:07:10	Uh...
93	00:07:10	00:07:15	It looks like Vance was appealing his conviction on grounds of new evidence.
94	00:07:15	00:07:18	What new evidence? Uh...
95	00:07:18	00:07:19	Police bias.
96	00:07:19	00:07:22	Stuff like that. I still have a lot of work to do here, Jim.
97	00:07:22	00:07:30	You know, if I were in prison for killing my wife, I don't think I'd put her photo on the wall.
98	00:07:30	00:07:33	Wow. She's sexy.
99	00:07:33	00:07:36	Yeah, yeah. Well, she's good-looking.
100	00:07:36	00:07:38	Yeah. I remember Anne- Marie's first day on the job.
101	00:07:38	00:07:42	She walked in the squad room and every guy's neck practically snapped.
102	00:07:42	00:07:43	She knew how to work it, too.
103	00:07:43	00:07:45	Was she married to Vance back then?
104	00:07:45	00:07:49	No. They didn't hook up till after she was transferred to Brime.
105	00:07:49	00:07:50	Marriage was a mistake.
106	00:07:50	00:07:52	She wasn't the settling-down type.
107	00:07:52	00:07:57	Vance told anybody who would listen that he'd never let her go.
108	00:07:57	00:07:59	Could be why he killed her.
109	00:07:59	00:08:03	A woman like Anne-Marie could make a man do a lot of things he'd regret.
110	00:08:10	00:08:12	Hey.
111	00:08:12	00:08:15	Hey. So I, uh, pulled the video surveillance.
112	00:08:15	00:08:16	It's a total pile-on.
113	00:08:16	00:08:18	You can't really see anything.
114	00:08:18	00:08:19	Nice colors, though.
115	00:08:19	00:08:21	Kind of like a Redskins game.
116	00:08:21	00:08:22	With one dead Cowboy.
117	00:08:22	00:08:25	And someone else calling the plays.
118	00:08:25	00:08:27	One guy gives the other a signal.
119	00:08:27	00:08:29	No way this jumped off by accident.
120	00:08:29	00:08:31	And only one guy gets stuck.
121	00:08:31	00:08:32	An ex-cop.
122	00:08:32	00:08:34	This was a hit.
123	00:09:11	00:09:19	So, if we say that our victim, Vance Tolsom, was here...
124	00:09:19	00:09:27	Well, the trajectory of the blood spatter and the void on his right side would put Jose Castia here.
125	00:09:27	00:09:34	The bloodstains and the void on Carlos Salavar would put him here.
126	00:09:34	00:09:38	Which just leaves Tomas Molinez.
127	00:09:38	00:09:46	Arterial spurting pattern, straight shot, no void, would put him directly in front of our victim.
128	00:09:52	00:09:58	Carlos, Jose...
129	00:09:58	00:10:00	slide in from the side.
130	00:10:02	00:10:06	Probably pin Vance's arms down.
131	00:10:08	00:10:10	They were just the wing-men.
132	00:10:10	00:10:13	Looks like we found our doer.
133	00:10:13	00:10:15	Tomas Molinez.
134	00:10:15	00:10:19	Formerly employed by Riverton, Marx and Flegel, Certified Public Accountants.
135	00:10:19	00:10:25	So you're currently two years into a 30-year bid for a triple fatal DUI.
136	00:10:25	00:10:27	Family in a van.
137	00:10:27	00:10:30	So you're the one holding the shiv.
138	00:10:30	00:10:35	So if I were you, Tomas, I'd make a deal with me. Now.
139	00:10:35	00:10:38	Last time I heard that, I got stuck with 30 years.
140	00:10:38	00:10:41	You have no idea what it's like to be in that place.
141	00:10:41	00:10:42	No, I don't.
142	00:10:42	00:10:44	Because I don't drink and drive.
143	00:10:44	00:10:47	Look, you're still a relatively young man.
144	00:10:47	00:10:49	I mean, let's make a deal. Let's talk.
145	00:10:49	00:10:54	Shave off a few years, so you don't have to leave prison in a walker.
146	00:10:54	00:10:56	You know? You think I'm an idiot.
147	00:10:56	00:10:58	Look, I killed a cop.
148	00:10:58	00:11:03	I am tired of being everybody's bitch.
149	00:11:03	00:11:06	Cop killer? That's a different story.
150	00:11:06	00:11:09	It gives me status, juice.
151	00:11:11	00:11:14	Even if I get life, it's still better than what I've got now.
152	00:11:14	00:11:16	Man...
153	00:11:20	00:11:22	Well, that is sad.
154	00:11:22	00:11:25	All right, look, we deal on that, but you know how this works.
155	00:11:25	00:11:27	You got to give something to get something, so give me something.
156	00:11:27	00:11:31	Look, if I rat, I am dead tomorrow.
157	00:11:31	00:11:32	So you can't give me names.
158	00:11:32	00:11:33	So give me a reason why. Why the cop?
159	00:11:33	00:11:36	Someone have issues with him on the inside?
160	00:11:38	00:11:41	Look, I overheard some chisme.
161	00:11:41	00:11:47	The hit was a favor for somebody on the outside.
162	00:11:50	00:11:52	Hey, Catherine, you got a minute?
163	00:11:52	00:11:53	Sure. What's up?
164	00:11:53	00:11:56	You mind if I shut your door for a second?
165	00:11:56	00:11:58	All right.
166	00:12:00	00:12:03	Wind-up's got me curious.
167	00:12:03	00:12:06	Well, I found a little something in Vance's cell.
168	00:12:06	00:12:08	I thought I'd give you a heads-up.
169	00:12:08	00:12:16	Yeah, he was putting together a case for a new trial, and apparently, his wife was sleeping around before and after they said I do.
170	00:12:16	00:12:18	Look, I knew Anne-Marie.
171	00:12:18	00:12:21	She wasn't doing anything the guys in the department weren't doing.
172	00:12:21	00:12:23	Yeah, 'cause they were all doing it with her.
173	00:12:23	00:12:24	Yeah, and probably getting attaboyed for it.
174	00:12:24	00:12:26	Double standard.
175	00:12:26	00:12:28	The point is, he put together a list of bedfellows.
176	00:12:28	00:12:33	I don't know where this list came from, or why it didn't come up at his trial, but listen.
177	00:12:33	00:12:36	It reads like a who's who of Southern Nevada law enforcement.
178	00:12:36	00:12:37	Anybody we know?
179	00:12:37	00:12:40	Ecklie's on there.
180	00:12:40	00:12:42	Really?
181	00:12:42	00:12:44	Wow. Oh, good for him.
182	00:12:44	00:12:48	Brass, too. Well, Jim used to be a player back in the day.
183	00:12:48	00:12:50	Kind of had that Jersey, Jack Nicholson thing.
184	00:12:50	00:12:52	Who else? Ah, let's see here.
185	00:12:52	00:12:56	Atwater, Bastille, Bracket, Brooks, Cavaliere. I'm only up to the C's.
186	00:12:56	00:12:57	You want me to keep going?
187	00:12:57	00:12:59	Uh, let me guess.
188	00:12:59	00:13:00	Vega? Um, McKeen, for sure, right?
189	00:13:00	00:13:01	Mm-hmm.
190	00:13:01	00:13:04	Vartann is on here, as well.
191	00:13:04	00:13:07	Sorry to be the one to break that to you.
192	00:13:07	00:13:10	Ancient history.
193	00:13:10	00:13:16	Well, according to Vance's notes, he's convinced that Anne-Marie's real murderer is a cop on this list.
194	00:13:22	00:13:27	Well, half these guys worked Anne-Marie's murder.
195	00:13:27	00:13:29	Yeah, I know. I read the file.
196	00:13:29	00:13:34	Brass was lead for LVPD, and Vartann was his second.
197	00:13:34	00:13:36	Why didn't those guys recuse themselves?
198	00:13:36	00:13:37	I don't know.
199	00:13:37	00:13:42	Book the evidence, make me copies, I'll take care of the notifications.
200	00:13:42	00:13:47	Oh, boy, when this hits the fan, it's going to come back on all of us.
201	00:13:51	00:13:54	So, I was riding the party train pretty nonstop back then.
202	00:13:54	00:13:57	I mean, work was like an interruption to my fun, yeah.
203	00:13:57	00:14:01	So, um, there was a homicide convention in New Orleans.
204	00:14:01	00:14:02	Anne-Marie was there.
205	00:14:02	00:14:14	She was certainly sexy, and-and available, so we hooked up, and, um, when Anne-Marie was murdered, I went up the chain of command, I-I... I told my boss about our involvement, he told me not to sweat it.
206	00:14:14	00:14:16	You know, I-I did the right thing, yeah.
207	00:14:16	00:14:18	So what about you, Conrad?
208	00:14:18	00:14:20	Well, I didn't handle any of the evidence. My team did.
209	00:14:20	00:14:22	And it was just...
210	00:14:22	00:14:25	It was... It was just dinner with benefits.
211	00:14:25	00:14:27	Anne-Marie stopped by the lab to discuss a case.
212	00:14:27	00:14:29	She was hungry.
213	00:14:29	00:14:31	One thing led to another, and to a...
214	00:14:31	00:14:34	to a room at the Gold Coast.
215	00:14:34	00:14:36	Gold Coast.
216	00:14:36	00:14:37	Couldn't do any better than that?
217	00:14:37	00:14:40	You know, Anne-Marie's car was found on the county line.
218	00:14:40	00:14:44	I mean, LVPD assisted Brime Sheriffs, but Brime was in charge of the investigation.
219	00:14:44	00:14:46	Plenty of Brime guys on that list.
220	00:14:46	00:14:52	Look, Vance got whacked just as he was about to get a new trial, dredge up the past.
221	00:14:52	00:14:54	Maybe somebody didn't want the truth to come out.
222	00:14:54	00:14:57	Yeah, somebody who could reach into prison.
223	00:14:57	00:15:00	Well, those two bangers who put Tomas Molinez up for the hit-- they're from Brime County.
224	00:15:00	00:15:02	Okay, so that's where we start, with the bangers.
225	00:16:12	00:16:15	Jose, is this medical marijuana?
226	00:16:17	00:16:19	What's the matter? You depressed about something?
227	00:16:19	00:16:21	You on the family plan?
228	00:16:21	00:16:25	You know, texting can be very expensive, Carlos. Could get you another five years.
229	00:16:25	00:16:28	Gentlemen, ran across something interesting in the visitor log.
230	00:16:28	00:16:30	Yeah? What's what?
231	00:16:30	00:16:34	Other than his lawyer, Vance has had only one visitor, Jody Cambry.
232	00:16:34	00:16:37	Who's Jody Cambry? His dead wife's sister.
233	00:16:37	00:16:39	She was here pretty much every week for three months.
234	00:16:39	00:16:41	Guy kills her sister.
235	00:16:41	00:16:42	Why would she come visit him?
236	00:16:42	00:16:45	Maybe she wanted to see the man suffer.
237	00:16:45	00:16:47	Yeah, I hated him.
238	00:16:47	00:16:49	And I hated the fact he wouldn't leave me alone.
239	00:16:49	00:16:51	Wrote to me every week.
240	00:16:51	00:16:54	I just threw his letters away.
241	00:16:54	00:16:56	So, why'd you go see him?
242	00:16:56	00:16:59	One day, I opened up one of his letters.
243	00:16:59	00:17:00	He wanted to talk.
244	00:17:00	00:17:03	He had something important he needed to tell me.
245	00:17:03	00:17:07	I thought maybe he would tell me where he buried Anne-Marie.
246	00:17:07	00:17:09	That's not what happened.
247	00:17:09	00:17:11	Hmm.
248	00:17:11	00:17:13	Vance swore up and down that he was innocent.
249	00:17:13	00:17:15	That it was all a setup.
250	00:17:15	00:17:16	And you believed him?
251	00:17:16	00:17:19	Enough that I started looking into things.
252	00:17:19	00:17:21	Talking to people.
253	00:17:21	00:17:23	Annie's friends, other cops, family.
254	00:17:25	00:17:28	Everybody had a story about some guy Annie had been with.
255	00:17:30	00:17:35	Thing is, a lot of them had investigated her murder.
256	00:17:35	00:17:38	That's grounds for a new trial.
257	00:17:38	00:17:41	So I started putting together a list.
258	00:17:41	00:17:44	What, you think one of the guys on your list is the real killer?
259	00:17:44	00:17:47	I think Annie could make any guy crazy.
260	00:17:47	00:17:52	Before she died, Annie told me she'd fallen in love again.
261	00:17:52	00:17:54	Said this guy was the one.
262	00:17:54	00:17:57	She was going to leave Vance.
263	00:17:57	00:17:58	She wouldn't tell me who he was.
264	00:17:58	00:18:01	So he could be any one of the guys on that list?
265	00:18:01	00:18:04	All I know is that he was a cop.
266	00:18:04	00:18:05	Annie only dated cops.
267	00:18:05	00:18:08	I also know Vance was never going to let her go.
268	00:18:10	00:18:13	So... whoever she was leading on...
269	00:18:15	00:18:17	...she was playing a dangerous game.
270	00:18:17	00:18:19	Why didn't you bring up any of this at the trial?
271	00:18:19	00:18:22	Because back then, like everyone else, I thought Vance killed her.
272	00:18:22	00:18:25	What makes you so sure he didn't?
273	00:18:25	00:18:26	I just know.
274	00:18:28	00:18:30	I just know.
275	00:18:41	00:18:43	How's the leg?
276	00:18:43	00:18:45	Ah, it's better.
277	00:18:45	00:18:48	This is, uh...
278	00:18:48	00:18:53	This is new, seeing you outside of the office, middle of the day with your clothes on.
279	00:18:55	00:18:59	Well, I thought that maybe you and I should have a cup of coffee.
280	00:18:59	00:19:01	Okay.
281	00:19:01	00:19:04	Excuse me?
282	00:19:04	00:19:06	Um... (clears throat)
283	00:19:08	00:19:17	You know, uh, I met Anne-Marie at the Academy, and, uh, yes, we had some good times over the years.
284	00:19:17	00:19:20	It's all over the department about the list.
285	00:19:20	00:19:23	I guess I'm on it? Is this my unofficial heads-up?
286	00:19:23	00:19:30	Lou, you had a relationship with a murder victim, you worked the case, and you didn't think you should have recused yourself?
287	00:19:30	00:19:34	Oh. So this is more of an officialheads-up.
288	00:19:34	00:19:37	Well, Vance claimed that there was a rush to judgment.
289	00:19:37	00:19:40	That you guys didn't even look past him for the real killer.
290	00:19:40	00:19:42	You guys?
291	00:19:42	00:19:47	What? Are-Are you saying-- that, um, I didn't do my job because I had a thing with Anne-Marie?
292	00:19:47	00:19:50	When Warrick was murdered, did you recuse yourself?
293	00:19:50	00:19:52	Did your team recuse themselves?
294	00:19:52	00:19:55	Hell, Nick nearly put a bullet through Undersheriff McKeen.
295	00:19:55	00:19:57	Then again, that's Nick.
296	00:19:57	00:19:59	You're sure that Vance was good for it?
297	00:19:59	00:20:00	Yeah, I'm sure.
298	00:20:00	00:20:02	Look, he threatened Anne-Marie more than once, all right?
299	00:20:02	00:20:04	In front of other cops.
300	00:20:04	00:20:07	If you ever try to leave me, I'll kill you.
301	00:20:07	00:20:09	Guys say a lot of things. What was your evidence?
302	00:20:09	00:20:10	Oh, come on.
303	00:20:10	00:20:12	Really, you want me to run it?
304	00:20:12	00:20:14	I do.
305	00:20:16	00:20:18	Okay.
306	00:20:18	00:20:22	Brime County never found Anne-Marie's body, but they did find her car.
307	00:20:22	00:20:25	Vance torched it, but Ecklie's team still found blood.
308	00:20:25	00:20:31	And they also found Vance's bloody clothes and a bloody kitchen knife from their kitchen in a Dumpster off the 160.
309	00:20:31	00:20:35	Now in the pocket, there was a matchbook which we tied to the arson of the car.
310	00:20:35	00:20:37	It was a good case.
311	00:20:37	00:20:39	Maybe too good.
312	00:20:39	00:20:43	Okay, you know, I've never heard you say that about any of the cases that you've closed.
313	00:20:43	00:20:49	I'm just saying that a cop that's smart enough to disappear his wife's body should be smart enough to disappear the evidence.
314	00:20:49	00:20:52	You know what?
315	00:20:52	00:20:56	If this inquisition is over, I got work to do. Thank you.
316	00:20:58	00:21:00	Uh, just forget the coffee. Sorry.
317	00:21:07	00:21:12	Greg, I need you to pull all of the Anne-Marie Tolsom evidence.
318	00:21:12	00:21:14	Rerun everything.
319	00:22:09	00:22:16	I reran all the blood evidence from Anne-Marie's case-- the car, Vance's clothes, the knife.
320	00:22:16	00:22:18	Found high levels of EDTA.
321	00:22:18	00:22:20	What made you test for that?
322	00:22:20	00:22:22	It doesn't come up in standard tox tests.
323	00:22:22	00:22:26	Well, because the time stamp on this photo was two hours after the car was found.
324	00:22:26	00:22:29	Blood clots after about 20 minutes.
325	00:22:30	00:22:32	I don't see any clotting.
326	00:22:32	00:22:38	Exactly. When blood clots, the fibrinogen in the blood forms a big net, catching all the red blood cells.
327	00:22:38	00:22:42	The clot retracts into a clump that would have left a ring of straw-colored serum.
328	00:22:42	00:22:46	So somebody collected Anne-Marie's blood and added an anticoagulant.
329	00:22:46	00:22:50	Now, the only reason somebody would do something like that is if you were gonna store it.
330	00:22:50	00:22:52	Ortransport it and plant it...
331	00:22:52	00:22:54	whenever and wherever they want.
332	00:22:54	00:22:58	So... the blood evidence was allplanted.
333	00:22:58	00:22:59	Vance was right.
334	00:22:59	00:23:01	He was framed.
335	00:23:01	00:23:02	Probably by the real killer.
336	00:23:02	00:23:05	And most definitely by someone with knowledge of serology.
337	00:23:05	00:23:08	Yeah, a cop, or a CSI.
338	00:23:08	00:23:09	You know what?
339	00:23:09	00:23:11	I've seen this before.
340	00:23:11	00:23:13	This...
341	00:23:13	00:23:16	matchbook trick.
342	00:23:16	00:23:22	Here we go-- in 1995, a torched car in Salt Lake traced back to a murder in Brime County.
343	00:23:22	00:23:25	Suspect was arrested in Pahrump.
344	00:23:25	00:23:27	All right, where are we going with this?
345	00:23:27	00:23:28	Planted blood evidence.
346	00:23:28	00:23:30	The matchbook?
347	00:23:30	00:23:33	What cops know about forensics, they learn from their cases.
348	00:23:33	00:23:34	Who was the arresting officer?
349	00:23:34	00:23:39	Lucas Martin. He was the lead detective in Anne-Marie's murder in Brime County.
350	00:23:39	00:23:46	1997-- case in Brime, staged crime scene with EDTA blood-- investigating officer...
351	00:23:46	00:23:48	Lucas Martin.
352	00:23:48	00:23:52	There you go. So maybe he was Anne-Marie's mystery lover.
353	00:23:52	00:23:58	Why isn't he on the list? The sister didn't know his name-- she just assumed he was a cop on that list.
354	00:23:58	00:24:01	Okay. (sighs) Lucas Martin was Anne-Marie's final conquest.
355	00:24:01	00:24:08	When she wouldn't leave Vance for him, he snapped, killed her, and framed Vance for it, and he did it by taking cues from his old cases.
356	00:24:08	00:24:10	Anne-Marie's body was never found.
357	00:24:10	00:24:12	At least we know now where to look.
358	00:24:25	00:24:33	Do you mind telling me why there's a crime scene here but no 419, no 420, 30 in the morning?
359	00:24:33	00:24:34	We're anticipating a crime scene, Conrad.
360	00:24:34	00:24:39	That seems to be your team's M.O. lately-- what, you don't get enough work, you got to go out and look for it?
361	00:24:39	00:24:40	Actually, Conrad, it is a crime scene.
362	00:24:40	00:24:45	We're working a theory on the List case. Yeah, I think you're familiar with it.
363	00:24:45	00:24:46	Yeah, don't be a smart-ass, Stokes.
364	00:24:47	00:24:48	Picked up a scent, Captain.
365	00:24:48	00:24:52	With any luck, we're gonna find the body of Anne-Marie Tolsom.
366	00:24:52	00:24:53	Catherine.
367	00:24:55	00:24:57	I want the full 411.
368	00:24:59	00:25:07	We think that Detective Lucas Martin killed Anne-Marie, and that he used knowledge of his old cases to plant evidence implicating Vance.
369	00:25:07	00:25:09	He planted Anne-Marie the same way.
370	00:25:09	00:25:11	All right, so why this place?
371	00:25:11	00:25:12	Well, Martin worked a case here.
372	00:25:12	00:25:16	A case in which a guy killed his girlfriend, dumped her body.
373	00:25:16	00:25:20	The Brime County Sheriffs would never have found her body, but the guy confessed.
374	00:25:21	00:25:23	Let's go. Go.
375	00:25:23	00:25:28	I don't see any Brime County participation here. Well, that's where you come in.
376	00:25:28	00:25:29	I was hoping you'd give them a call.
377	00:25:29	00:25:31	Catherine, I can see this circus from the highway.
378	00:25:31	00:25:33	I don't need to call anyone.
379	00:25:41	00:25:43	There's something in there.
380	00:25:45	00:25:48	Go ahead, Nick.
381	00:26:02	00:26:05	Let's see what's behind door number two, shall we?
382	00:26:05	00:26:07	(insects buzzing) Blow flies.
383	00:26:07	00:26:08	Yeah.
384	00:26:08	00:26:11	Something's dead.
385	00:26:40	00:26:42	More flies.
386	00:26:45	00:26:48	Two sets of footprints.
387	00:26:49	00:26:54	No telling how long they've been here.
388	00:26:56	00:26:58	More footprints.
389	00:27:03	00:27:04	There's a body.
390	00:27:18	00:27:19	Fresh.
391	00:27:19	00:27:22	It's not Anne-Marie.
392	00:27:22	00:27:23	No, that's her sister, Jody.
393	00:27:23	00:27:26	Man, I just talked to her.
394	00:27:26	00:27:29	Two GSW's to the back of the head.
395	00:27:29	00:27:31	medium caliber.
396	00:27:31	00:27:33	Maybe nine-mil.
397	00:27:33	00:27:34	Brime County issues nine-mils.
398	00:27:55	00:27:57	What the hell are you people doing here?
399	00:27:57	00:28:01	Detective Lucas Martin. I saw you at, uh, Steve Jackson's wedding last year.
400	00:28:01	00:28:04	You know Jim Brass-- you two worked the Anne-Marie Tolsom case.
401	00:28:04	00:28:06	You ever hear of professional courtesy?
402	00:28:06	00:28:08	We're on the trail of Anne-Marie's body.
403	00:28:08	00:28:09	You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
404	00:28:09	00:28:11	Well, I damn straight would.
405	00:28:11	00:28:13	I turned over this whole county looking for her.
406	00:28:13	00:28:15	She's not here. Well, somebody is.
407	00:28:15	00:28:17	We just found Anne-Marie's sister, Jody Cambry.
408	00:28:17	00:28:19	She's been shot dead.
409	00:28:21	00:28:23	Lucas Martin, Catherine Willows.
410	00:28:23	00:28:26	When was the last time you fired your gun, Detective?
411	00:28:26	00:28:29	Screw you, bitch.
412	00:28:29	00:28:30	I think you mean, Screw you, CSI Willows.
413	00:28:30	00:28:32	It's okay. I'll get a warrant.
414	00:28:34	00:28:36	Let's go.
415	00:28:43	00:28:46	Go ahead, start without me.
416	00:28:46	00:28:48	Mrs. Robbins always does.
417	00:28:53	00:28:55	I was talking about dinner.
418	00:28:55	00:28:58	Go ahead, take a look. (sighs)
419	00:28:58	00:29:00	I'd recognize that shape anywhere.
420	00:29:00	00:29:02	She was pistol-whipped.
421	00:29:04	00:29:09	Two bullets within three inches of each other.
422	00:29:09	00:29:10	Killer had training in firearms.
423	00:29:10	00:29:19	And all of the evidence points to a cop. From what I've heard, everything's pointing to Detective Lucas Martin. Well, then let's get those two bullets out of her and see if they point to him, too.
424	00:29:47	00:29:52	We pulled two slugs out of Jody Cambry's head, right where you left them.
425	00:29:52	00:29:56	I can dummy up a report like this in about five minutes.
426	00:29:56	00:30:00	My duty weapon was never out of my sight, and it's never been fired.
427	00:30:00	00:30:01	No, not thatgun.
428	00:30:01	00:30:04	We're cops-- we have guns that have guns.
429	00:30:04	00:30:08	I'm talking about the attaboy that Judge Grantson gave you after the Domingo Flan trial.
430	00:30:08	00:30:09	That gun.
431	00:30:09	00:30:10	The Sig nine-mil.
432	00:30:10	00:30:12	It was in the database before you even got it.
433	00:30:12	00:30:15	And ballistics matched it to the Jody Cambry murder.
434	00:30:15	00:30:17	I don't have that gun anymore.
435	00:30:17	00:30:18	Well, that's a relief.
436	00:30:18	00:30:24	That means there's a record, assuming that you went through proper channels to sell it. I sold it to a guy at a gun show.
437	00:30:24	00:30:25	Out of state.
438	00:30:25	00:30:26	Well, now it's in state.
439	00:30:26	00:30:28	Maybe it got homesick.
440	00:30:28	00:30:30	You charging me?
441	00:30:30	00:30:31	As a matter of fact, I am.
442	00:30:31	00:30:35	You better lawyer up and call the union, 'cause you're under arrest.
443	00:30:36	00:30:38	Did you hear the good news?
444	00:30:38	00:30:42	Brass booked Lucas Martin for Jody's murder, and that's just for starters.
445	00:30:42	00:30:44	Well, there might be a problem.
446	00:30:44	00:30:47	(wry chuckle) I am too tired to hear that, Ray.
447	00:30:47	00:30:49	Jody died yesterday, 20-hundred hours.
448	00:30:49	00:30:51	I checked the duty log.
449	00:30:51	00:30:53	Lucas Martin was working.
450	00:30:53	00:30:55	Well, that doesn't actually mean that he was working the entire time.
451	00:30:55	00:30:58	I knew a cop once who painted his house while on duty.
452	00:30:58	00:31:00	It's still an alibi.
453	00:31:00	00:31:02	What about the epithelials under Jody's nails?
454	00:31:02	00:31:04	Still waiting for results.
455	00:31:04	00:31:08	Look, if Martin ordered the hit on Vance, he must have reached out to Carlos Salavar.
456	00:31:08	00:31:11	Carlos isn't talking, Ray.
457	00:31:11	00:31:14	Maybe he'll listen.
458	00:31:15	00:31:17	Where are the real cops at, lab rat?
459	00:31:17	00:31:20	I thought we'd have a conversation, you and me.
460	00:31:20	00:31:23	Conversation. Mm-hmm.
461	00:31:23	00:31:26	So you don't want to stick nothing in my mouth, hm?
462	00:31:26	00:31:27	That's what y'all do, right?
463	00:31:27	00:31:31	I know that Lucas Martin contacted you and put the hit on that cop.
464	00:31:31	00:31:32	You don't know jack.
465	00:31:32	00:31:39	I got your phone, Carlos, all your texts to your sister Reina about your nephew Chuy getting busted for drugs and going to jail.
466	00:31:39	00:31:42	I know she has four other kids at home.
467	00:31:42	00:31:45	She never had $5,000 to pay Chuy's bail.
468	00:31:45	00:31:48	Then all of a sudden, she has $5,000?
469	00:31:48	00:31:50	Five G's just like that?
470	00:31:50	00:31:53	(quietly) You and I both know where that kind of money comes from, don't we?
471	00:31:53	00:31:56	Escucha, mi amigo.
472	00:31:56	00:31:59	Amigo,one phone call, they roll your sister up.
473	00:31:59	00:32:02	Her kids, they go to Child Services.
474	00:32:02	00:32:05	You know what happens in Child Services, don't you?
475	00:32:05	00:32:08	Oh, that's right... you grew up there. (grunting)
476	00:32:08	00:32:12	You want to swell up, go ahead-- call somebody in here; they can help you with that.
477	00:32:12	00:32:17	You gonna let your sister go down and those kids go into Child Services because of a cop?
478	00:32:19	00:32:22	I'm gonna ask you one more time, Carlos.
479	00:32:22	00:32:25	Where did your sister get the $5,000?
480	00:32:26	00:32:28	Que baboso.
481	00:32:28	00:32:32	You got no idea, bro.
482	00:32:32	00:32:35	I don't know no Lucas Martin.
483	00:32:35	00:32:37	You got the wrong cop.
484	00:32:50	00:32:52	Sorry.
485	00:32:56	00:32:58	Running from another stripper?
486	00:32:58	00:32:59	Burlesque dancer.
487	00:32:59	00:33:00	And that's not funny.
488	00:33:00	00:33:02	I'm sorry.
489	00:33:02	00:33:05	So I ran the epithelials from Jody Cambry's fingernails.
490	00:33:05	00:33:06	Yeah. You're not going to believe this.
491	00:33:06	00:33:09	Try me. Well, they didn't come from Lucas Martin.
492	00:33:09	00:33:11	In fact, they're not even male.
493	00:33:11	00:33:14	Epithelials are a sibling match to Jody.
494	00:33:14	00:33:16	(scoffs) What?
495	00:33:16	00:33:21	Yeah, and Jody only has one sibling-- Anne-Marie Tolsom.
496	00:33:21	00:33:25	So that means that Anne-Marie is alive.
497	00:33:31	00:33:35	We thought that all this evidence was planted to cover up a murder.
498	00:33:35	00:33:38	We now know that it was planted to cover Anne-Marie's disappearance.
499	00:33:38	00:33:42	And put Vance in prison for a crime he didn't commit.
500	00:33:42	00:33:43	I thought he was good for it.
501	00:33:43	00:33:47	Yeah, me, too. I believe you were led by Lucas Martin and Anne-Marie.
502	00:33:47	00:33:49	For love.
503	00:33:49	00:33:52	Martin helped her to get out from under Vance.
504	00:33:52	00:33:54	Great, we just solved a four-year-old case we didn't even know was open.
505	00:33:54	00:33:57	We still got two real murders with two real bodies.
506	00:33:57	00:34:00	Well, if you believe the gangbanger, Martin's not helping her anymore.
507	00:34:00	00:34:02	Yeah, some other cop put the hit out on Vance?
508	00:34:02	00:34:04	Give me a break. Martin's gun shot Jody.
509	00:34:04	00:34:06	We found her at one of his old body dump sites.
510	00:34:06	00:34:08	I mean, it sounds to me like he's helping her.
511	00:34:08	00:34:14	Well, I hate to defend the guy, but, you know, really, a cop using his own gun that he knows is in the system-- I mean, that is beyond dumb.
512	00:34:14	00:34:19	Martin said he had gotten rid of the gun, and any cop in Brime County should know about that dump site.
513	00:34:19	00:34:21	Well, the evidence puts Anne-Marie at the scene.
514	00:34:21	00:34:23	Maybe the gun was in her hand.
515	00:34:26	00:34:29	Who'd you give the gun to, Lucas?
516	00:34:29	00:34:31	No gun show story? 'Cause that was funny.
517	00:34:31	00:34:33	I could listen to that again.
518	00:34:33	00:34:34	I didn't kill Jody.
519	00:34:34	00:34:39	You know, I want to believe you, man, I'm trying, but all the evidence points to you...
520	00:34:39	00:34:41	unless you gave your gun to Anne-Marie, you know.
521	00:34:41	00:34:51	Oh, yeah, surprise, we, we know that Anne-Marie is still alive, and we know the two of you framed Vance for murder and now she's throwing you under the bus and trying to frame you.
522	00:34:53	00:34:56	Hey... I get it.
523	00:34:57	00:34:59	I get the obsession.
524	00:34:59	00:35:01	Anne-Marie is a force of nature, you know.
525	00:35:01	00:35:04	She makes everybody feel like you're the only guy in the world.
526	00:35:04	00:35:06	I get it.
527	00:35:09	00:35:12	I loved her.
528	00:35:12	00:35:13	Still do.
529	00:35:13	00:35:19	We were in love, we were going to be together, and we both know Vance is a bad guy-- bad to her.
530	00:35:19	00:35:21	I didn't want him coming after us.
531	00:35:21	00:35:27	So you put Vance in prison, Anne-Marie disappears, and, uh, you, you, uh, you tag along later.
532	00:35:27	00:35:28	That the plan?
533	00:35:28	00:35:31	That was the plan.
534	00:35:32	00:35:36	I'd wait a couple years, put in my papers.
535	00:35:36	00:35:39	End of the summer, I'm retiring.
536	00:35:39	00:35:41	Meanwhile, I see her when I can.
537	00:35:41	00:35:43	Mm-hmm, send her any money?
538	00:35:44	00:35:51	That's a loaded question, 'cause we know that you're sending $1,000 a month to some orphan fund in Mexico.
539	00:35:51	00:35:53	$1,000 a month on a cop's salary?
540	00:35:53	00:35:55	And that's a lot of love for the poquito niños.
541	00:35:55	00:35:57	So here's the new plan.
542	00:35:57	00:36:03	What we're going to work on is a minimum sentence at a minimum- security prison.
543	00:36:03	00:36:06	Tell me about the gun.
544	00:36:08	00:36:10	I gave it to Annie for protection.
545	00:36:10	00:36:13	Where is she?
546	00:36:13	00:36:15	I don't know.
547	00:36:15	00:36:21	When I told her I was putting in for retirement, she stopped returning my calls.
548	00:36:23	00:36:25	Jim...
549	00:36:25	00:36:32	I swear to you, I didn't even know she was in town until you told me Jody got popped with my gun.
550	00:36:33	00:36:35	She's tough, huh?
551	00:36:35	00:36:41	I mean, when Anne-Marie dumps you, she really dumps you hard.
552	00:36:41	00:36:43	All right.
553	00:36:43	00:36:45	Well, all right, Jim.
554	00:36:45	00:36:48	We're at Jody's place now, so we'll see what we can dig up.
555	00:36:48	00:36:50	All right, thanks.
556	00:36:50	00:36:53	(phone beeps) Hey, Anne-Marie dumped Lucas Martin three months ago.
557	00:36:53	00:36:57	Now, that's right around the same time Jody started visiting Vance in prison.
558	00:36:57	00:36:59	I don't see any connection.
559	00:36:59	00:37:01	Bye-bye, sugar daddy.
560	00:37:01	00:37:03	What's she going to do for money now?
561	00:37:03	00:37:04	Get a new daddy.
562	00:37:05	00:37:07	Or...
563	00:37:07	00:37:11	reach out to her schoolteacher sister, who's collected on the life insurance.
564	00:37:19	00:37:20	Here we go.
565	00:37:20	00:37:25	On January 1, Jody's money market account shows a balance of half a million and change.
566	00:37:25	00:37:28	The account was opened two years ago.
567	00:37:28	00:37:31	Well, that sounds like Anne-Marie's life insurance. Mm-hmm.
568	00:37:31	00:37:33	That's about what a cop gets.
569	00:37:33	00:37:34	Jody had a big heart.
570	00:37:34	00:37:38	On January 5, she transferred half the money to an orphans' fund in Mexico.
571	00:37:38	00:37:39	Save the Niños.
572	00:37:39	00:37:42	That's the same charity that Lucas Martin was donating to.
573	00:37:42	00:37:45	Jody knew Anne-Marie was alive.
574	00:37:45	00:37:47	Yeah, maybe not till after January 5.
575	00:37:47	00:37:49	Three months ago.
576	00:37:49	00:37:50	You know, it all fits.
577	00:37:50	00:37:52	Dump Lucas, reach out to the sister.
578	00:37:52	00:37:54	Yeah, well, Jody should have reached out to the cops.
579	00:37:54	00:37:58	Yeah, maybe she didn't want to betray her sister or maybe she didn't want to let Vance rot in prison either.
580	00:37:58	00:38:00	That's probably why she went to go see him.
581	00:38:00	00:38:03	She knew he was innocent.
582	00:38:03	00:38:06	There's a bunch of payments to a law firm...
583	00:38:06	00:38:13	and one final transaction-- $110,000 wire transfer to Save the Niños Orphans' Fund...
584	00:38:13	00:38:15	in Mexico...
585	00:38:15	00:38:17	last night...
586	00:38:17	00:38:20	47 p.m.
587	00:38:20	00:38:25	47, Jody was already dead, Lucas Martin was in jail.
588	00:38:25	00:38:27	Anne-Marie was here.
589	00:38:27	00:38:29	She cleaned out Jody's account.
590	00:38:31	00:38:34	I think I know why Anne-Marie took the risk of coming back to Vegas.
591	00:38:34	00:38:37	She had to stop Vance from getting a second trial.
592	00:38:37	00:38:40	Killing him would have eliminated that problem, but there was still Jody.
593	00:38:40	00:38:42	There was always a chance that Jody would rat out her sister.
594	00:38:42	00:38:44	Right, so Anne-Marie had to kill her, too.
595	00:38:44	00:38:46	Why are you doing this?
596	00:38:46	00:38:47	I would have kept your secret.
597	00:38:47	00:38:49	For how long? You're my sister.
598	00:38:49	00:38:50	Forever.
599	00:38:50	00:38:53	Who better to frame for Jody's murder than Lucas Martin?
600	00:38:53	00:38:57	And we thought that Lucas killed Jody, and we thought that he arranged for the hit on Vance, but he didn't.
601	00:38:57	00:38:59	So who did?
602	00:38:59	00:39:02	Maybe another cop. It's a long list.
603	00:39:02	00:39:05	(chuckles) I wish I knew that many guys I could depend on.
604	00:39:05	00:39:07	You just need one.
605	00:39:07	00:39:11	Uh, should I stay, or is this case-related?
606	00:39:11	00:39:13	Stay.
607	00:39:13	00:39:17	While at the Academy, Anne-Marie was with a lot of guys, pre-list.
608	00:39:17	00:39:26	Anyway, I was trying to make a connection between Anne-Marie and the prison, and I remembered this guy from the Academy who-- he couldn't cut it, got tossed.
609	00:39:26	00:39:29	The two of them were close-- you know, friends.
610	00:39:29	00:39:34	Well, apparently he started a new career in corrections.
611	00:39:34	00:39:36	Jarrod Malone.
612	00:39:36	00:39:37	He's a C.O.
613	00:39:37	00:39:39	He's on Vance's cell block.
614	00:39:39	00:39:40	Yeah, what are the odds?
615	00:39:43	00:39:47	Annie, people are starting to ask questions.
616	00:39:47	00:39:49	Okay? It's not going to be okay.
617	00:39:49	00:39:52	Lucas got busted; he's going down, I could be next.
618	00:39:54	00:39:57	How do I know what he said?
619	00:39:57	00:39:59	Look, we got to act fast.
620	00:39:59	00:40:01	Where are you? I'll meet you.
621	00:40:02	00:40:05	My shift's over at midnight.
622	00:40:05	00:40:07	I'll be there.
623	00:40:49	00:40:51	Just had to make sure you were alone.
624	00:40:55	00:40:58	Not that I don't trust you.
625	00:40:59	00:41:01	It's kind of nice...
626	00:41:01	00:41:06	but I'm not wearing a wire.
627	00:41:08	00:41:11	Can I see your cell phone?
628	00:41:15	00:41:18	You're good; it's not wired either.
629	00:41:18	00:41:21	Well, a girl's got to be real careful, you know.
630	00:41:23	00:41:26	Especially when she's dead.
631	00:41:26	00:41:29	Got the tickets?
632	00:41:29	00:41:31	Morning flight.
633	00:41:32	00:41:36	Mr. and Mrs. Nobody.
634	00:41:41	00:41:43	You're going to love Mexico.
635	00:41:45	00:41:52	You know, I think I'm gonna like Costa Rica a little bit better, along with a hundred grand.
636	00:41:52	00:41:54	That wasn't the plan.
637	00:41:54	00:42:01	I know, but I've been thinking about that and, Vance and Lucas.
638	00:42:02	00:42:04	And now you don't trust me?
639	00:42:04	00:42:06	Jody was your sister.
640	00:42:06	00:42:07	You did that to your family.
641	00:42:07	00:42:08	She shouldn't have gone to Vance.
642	00:42:08	00:42:10	And so you took care of both of 'em?
643	00:42:10	00:42:12	Look, Jody was soft.
644	00:42:14	00:42:17	She always needed to fix things.
645	00:42:17	00:42:21	She didn't understand men.
646	00:42:21	00:42:25	And you, you can't be trusted.
647	00:42:32	00:42:34	You're right about that.
648	00:42:42	00:42:44	Annie, I know you got a gun.
649	00:42:44	00:42:45	I want to see your hands.
650	00:42:45	00:42:46	On your knees.
651	00:42:46	00:42:48	You son of a bitch.
652	00:42:48	00:42:53	I like you, but not enough to do 25 to life for you.
653	00:42:54	00:42:58	I know what you're thinking-- you already died once.
654	00:42:58	00:43:00	But don't do it for real this time, okay?
655	00:43:00	00:43:06	Oh, come on, Jimmy, you wouldn't shoot an unarmed woman, I think he'd shoot you.
656	00:43:06	00:43:08	I know I would.
657	00:43:08	00:43:10	Turn around.
658	00:43:16	00:43:18	Unarmed, huh?
659	00:43:21	00:43:23	(patting) Ooh.
660	00:43:23	00:43:25	Seems like old times, Lou.
661	00:43:28	00:43:30	You always did have the touch.
662	00:43:30	00:43:32	Yeah, well, you've lost yours.
663	00:43:32	00:43:34	We don't need to wire the guy.
664	00:43:34	00:43:36	The whole world is wired.
665	00:43:36	00:43:38	I could hear your heart beating from inside the van.
666	00:43:38	00:43:42	You've been gone a long time, baby.
667	00:43:42	00:43:44	Now you're going away for even longer.
668	00:43:46	00:43:49	Let's see how many men are on the jury.
