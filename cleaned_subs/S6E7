2,00:00:20,00:00:21,These guys are hard core.
3,00:00:21,00:00:22,Who are they?
4,00:00:24,00:00:26,(gunfire continues)
5,00:00:28,00:00:29,Tell Control these guys have automatic weapons!
6,00:00:29,00:00:31,Probably A-Ks!
7,00:00:31,00:00:33,With me!
8,00:00:33,00:00:39,"Three-David-34, be advised subjects are firing automatic weapons, possibly AK-47s."

12,00:00:50,00:00:51,OFFICER: We're going to get killed!
13,00:00:51,00:00:53,Not if you do what you're supposed to do.

17,00:01:55,00:01:57,They're out of rifle ammo!
18,00:02:08,00:02:10,(screaming)
19,00:02:11,00:02:12,They're running.
20,00:02:12,00:02:13,I'm going left. You go right.
21,00:02:13,00:02:15,"Going to take these guys. You guys, move on up."

31,00:02:43,00:02:44,"Adentro, adentro."
32,00:02:47,00:02:48,Cuff him.
33,00:02:53,00:02:54,"Dame una ambulancia, puey."
34,00:02:54,00:02:55,I don't speak Spanish.
35,00:03:04,00:03:06,"Back inside, back inside."
36,00:03:20,00:03:21,You okay?
37,00:03:21,00:03:22,Yeah. You?
38,00:03:27,00:03:28,What are you doing? Put it down.
39,00:03:28,00:03:31,"Yeah, sorry. I was just trying to secure his gun."
40,00:03:31,00:03:33,He's not going to use it anymore.
41,00:03:34,00:03:35,Stop! Police!
42,00:03:35,00:03:37,Stop! Police! Don't move!

45,00:03:55,00:03:56,"SOFIA: Brass, suspect's in custody."
46,00:03:56,00:03:57,Copy.
47,00:03:57,00:03:59,"Control, this is Brass."
48,00:03:59,00:04:01,Situation here is Code 4.
49,00:04:01,00:04:02,We have three suspects in custody.
50,00:04:02,00:04:04,One is on the run.
51,00:04:06,00:04:10,You know it's going to be a long shift when you get the call to respond to a command post.
52,00:04:10,00:04:12,Yeah. Warrick...
53,00:04:12,00:04:14,we need everyone from Grave.
54,00:04:14,00:04:15,But park on Wall Street.
55,00:04:15,00:04:18,Jefferson's taped off all the way back to Lincoln.
56,00:04:18,00:04:20,The suspect was last seen running south.
57,00:04:20,00:04:22,These buildings have been searched and cleared.
58,00:04:22,00:04:23,"Okay, move south one block."
59,00:04:23,00:04:24,Check each apartment.
60,00:04:25,00:04:28,This guy's armed and dangerous. You got a lot of witnesses claiming to have seen what happened.
61,00:04:28,00:04:30,"Okay, good. Let's get some vans down here, bring them all to the station."
62,00:04:30,00:04:32,What happened out here?
63,00:04:32,00:04:33,I was one of the shooters.
64,00:04:33,00:04:35,"So was Sofia, so you know the deal."
65,00:04:35,00:04:37,That's really all I'm allowed to say.
66,00:04:37,00:04:43,I see Detective Ortega had a hard head for my ass handling the case Just our luck.
67,00:04:45,00:04:48,DETECTIVE: Caprice full of shooters opened up on two of our guys. One's down.
68,00:04:48,00:04:49,Is Bell going to make it?
69,00:04:49,00:04:51,He's DOA.
70,00:04:51,00:04:52,Three suspects are dead.
71,00:04:53,00:04:54,Fourth outstanding.
72,00:04:54,00:04:56,"Excuse me... guys, hang tight."
73,00:04:57,00:04:58,I'm going to get some rides.
74,00:04:58,00:04:59,"Take you down to the station, okay?"
75,00:04:59,00:05:00,I want to get your statements.
76,00:05:00,00:05:01,BRASS: Yeah...
77,00:05:01,00:05:03,"Yeah. ORTEGA: Good, good."
78,00:05:06,00:05:07,I'll stay with them.
79,00:05:07,00:05:08,I'll collect their firearms and ammo.
80,00:05:08,00:05:10,All right. Good luck.
81,00:05:10,00:05:11,Thank you.
82,00:05:12,00:05:13,"Hell of a day, man."
83,00:05:14,00:05:16,It's just beginning.
84,00:05:56,00:05:58,OFFICER: GSW victim matches the suspect.
85,00:06:01,00:06:02,You shoot him?
86,00:06:02,00:06:03,"No, sir. Found him this way."
87,00:06:04,00:06:05,DETECTIVE: Bike strap...
88,00:06:05,00:06:06,This isn't our suspect.
89,00:06:06,00:06:08,This is a kid on his way to school.
90,00:06:08,00:06:09,Where's his bike? There was no bike.
91,00:06:09,00:06:10,Put out a broadcast.
92,00:06:10,00:06:14,Suspect may be on a bicycle.
93,00:06:14,00:06:15,We need medical transport. Code Three...
94,00:06:16,00:06:20,"Okay, everybody around here has got a video camera or a cell phone camera."
95,00:06:20,00:06:22,They'll all be taking pictures.
96,00:06:22,00:06:24,I think we all know how to operate in front of a camera.
97,00:06:24,00:06:26,Don't be caught picking your nose.
98,00:06:26,00:06:29,"GRISSOM: Catherine's back at the station, collecting the officers' guns."
99,00:06:30,00:06:31,This is the main crime scene.
100,00:06:31,00:06:33,"So Nick, you and Sara, take this."
101,00:06:33,00:06:36,There's two additional crime scenes down the alleys behind Third.
102,00:06:36,00:06:38,"Warrick, you take the west alley, I'll take the east."
103,00:06:38,00:06:40,And what do I get to do?
104,00:06:40,00:06:42,Go back to the lab and wait for a phone call?
105,00:06:42,00:06:45,This is a running gun battle that started 20 blocks back.
106,00:06:45,00:06:46,You get that.
107,00:06:46,00:06:49,"That's got to be, like, a mile?"
108,00:06:49,00:06:50,Who's with me?
109,00:06:50,00:06:53,SARA: A bunch of pissed-off locals with shot up cars.
110,00:06:53,00:06:54,Awesome.
111,00:06:54,00:06:55,WARRICK: You'll be all right.
112,00:07:05,00:07:08,"DAVID: Grissom, heard anything about Bell?"
113,00:07:09,00:07:11,"He died, David."
114,00:07:20,00:07:21,Is this gun in its original position?
115,00:07:21,00:07:24,The arresting officers kicked it clear of the suspect.
116,00:07:28,00:07:32,Nobody's touched it since I've been here.
117,00:07:34,00:07:37,"Well, there's no bullet holes in the back."
118,00:07:37,00:07:38,That's always good.
119,00:07:38,00:07:40,How many times was he hit?
120,00:07:40,00:07:41,I don't know.
121,00:07:41,00:07:43,"Officer, can you remove these handcuffs?"
122,00:07:43,00:07:44,Sure.
123,00:07:52,00:07:53,You have anything I can wipe these off with?
124,00:07:53,00:07:55,Yeah.
125,00:07:55,00:07:56,Thanks.
126,00:08:04,00:08:06,Looks like three went in.
127,00:08:06,00:08:07,"All right, leave him here, David."
128,00:08:07,00:08:10,Warrick's D.B.'s in the other alley just over there.
129,00:08:29,00:08:31,You did a hell of good job out there.
130,00:08:31,00:08:34,"Yeah, not good enough."
131,00:08:35,00:08:36,Has Bell's wife been notified?
132,00:08:36,00:08:38,The Sheriff's on his way to the house now.
133,00:08:38,00:08:42,"BRASS: You know, she's pregnant with their third kid."
134,00:08:43,00:08:45,We all know the risks.
135,00:08:48,00:08:50,Hey...
136,00:08:54,00:08:57,(sighing)
137,00:08:59,00:09:01,I remember my first shooting...
138,00:09:01,00:09:04,I appreciate the sentiment.
139,00:09:04,00:09:07,(whispering): We're not supposed to talk to each other till we give our statements.
140,00:09:07,00:09:09,"You're right, you're right You're up."
141,00:09:09,00:09:10,"Curtis, make yourself comfortable."
142,00:09:10,00:09:12,Okay.
143,00:09:18,00:09:20,This is Detective Nestor Ortega.
144,00:09:20,00:09:31,I am in PD Interrogation taking a statement from Captain James Brass regarding the officer-involved shooting that occurred around 0643 hours this morning.
145,00:09:32,00:09:42,CSI Catherine Willows is present to document and collect Captain Brass's firearm as evidence.
146,00:09:48,00:09:50,Ready?
147,00:09:50,00:09:51,Yeah.
148,00:09:54,00:09:55,You're not a patrol unit.
149,00:09:55,00:10:03,"Why did you get involved in the pursuit? Detective Curtis and I were just closing a robbery case and, uh, we stopped for a bite to eat."
150,00:10:03,00:10:05,DISPATCHER: ... all units in the vicinity.
151,00:10:05,00:10:09,Three-David-34 is in pursuit of a dark Chevy Caprice southbound on Paradise toward Desert Springs.
152,00:10:10,00:10:12,That's right near here.
153,00:10:15,00:10:18,We joined the pursuit on Desert Springs.
154,00:10:18,00:10:22,So you elected to back up the officers.
155,00:10:22,00:10:23,Yes.
156,00:10:23,00:10:25,Were the suspects shooting at the time?
157,00:10:25,00:10:27,Yes.
158,00:10:27,00:10:28,Could you tell the types of firearms they were using?
159,00:10:34,00:10:39,"Well, the two guys in the back had rifles, maybe AK's."
160,00:10:39,00:10:40,The other two had handguns.
161,00:10:40,00:10:42,I'm not sure what type.
162,00:10:44,00:10:48,"REPORTER: We're flying over Third Street where just this morning, police were involved in a deadly shootout."
163,00:10:56,00:10:57,Looks like a porcupine.
164,00:10:57,00:11:00,There's not enough room between rods for a human being to fit.
165,00:11:00,00:11:05,"No, Bell and Adams must have really been swerving and weaving."
166,00:11:07,00:11:10,78 bullet holes.
167,00:11:10,00:11:13,And Bell wasn't hit until he was outside the car.
168,00:11:14,00:11:18,"I heard Bell was a rookie, barely off training."
169,00:11:18,00:11:20,"It was just his time, I guess, huh?"
170,00:11:23,00:11:25,Suspect will be getting a ride with the coroner.
171,00:11:25,00:11:26,A little street justice.
172,00:11:26,00:11:27,Civilians okay?
173,00:11:27,00:11:29,Some old lady's going to need stitches.
174,00:11:29,00:11:32,The kid on the bike's critical in surgery.
175,00:11:32,00:11:34,You guys okay here?
176,00:11:34,00:11:37,I'll call and have the suspect's vehicle towed to CSI.
177,00:11:37,00:11:40,I'm going to start digging bullets out of people's houses.
178,00:11:42,00:11:45,I was just reloading and continuing firing.
179,00:11:45,00:11:47,I don't know what hit him.
180,00:11:47,00:11:49,(gunshots)
181,00:11:51,00:11:55,Bullets were flying. There were multiple rounds.
182,00:11:55,00:11:57,It was chaos.
183,00:11:57,00:12:02,At what point did Carolyn Davis go in foot pursuit after the two suspects?
184,00:12:02,00:12:08,"After the driver went down, the other suspect, I guess he felt it was getting too hot back there."
185,00:12:10,00:12:12,And they were shooting the entire time?
186,00:12:12,00:12:19,"Oh, yeah. I mean, it was like, you know, those movie guns; they never run out of bullets."
187,00:12:19,00:12:21,I don't go to the movies.
188,00:12:21,00:12:22,Oh.
189,00:12:25,00:12:26,What happened next?
190,00:12:28,00:12:31,The next thing I remember...
191,00:12:35,00:12:38,the next thing I remember is Bell.
192,00:12:43,00:12:45,Bell went down.
193,00:12:45,00:12:46,(gunshot)
194,00:12:56,00:13:00,He was... he was just a kid.
195,00:13:07,00:13:09,MAN: Todo lo que vi fue la policia disparando!
196,00:13:09,00:13:13,MAN 2: Yo ohi que uno de ellos ya se habia calmado cuando le metieron un balazo!
197,00:13:13,00:13:14,Are they saying what I think they're saying?
198,00:13:14,00:13:19,"""Policia hirieron esos muchachos en la espalda""?"
199,00:13:19,00:13:23,Yeah. They claim they saw the cops shoot the suspects in the back.
200,00:13:23,00:13:25,"Hey, not to mention there's an innocent kid in the hospital."
201,00:13:25,00:13:28,See? Another one they killed! Where's his gun!
202,00:13:28,00:13:30,"CAVALIERE: Hey, let us do our job here, okay?"
203,00:13:30,00:13:33,WOMAN: Mi hija vio a sus policias disparle a un nino en la espalda.
204,00:13:33,00:13:36,"Senora, donde esta su hija, huh?"
205,00:13:36,00:13:38,Queremos hablar con ella.
206,00:13:38,00:13:40,La policia se la llevo.
207,00:13:40,00:13:42,Usted vio algo de lo que paso?
208,00:13:42,00:13:45,No?
209,00:13:45,00:13:47,Nobody saw anything.
210,00:13:47,00:13:49,I don't think this is police issue.
211,00:13:49,00:13:52,"Look, these folks were suspicious of the cops long before this happened."
212,00:13:52,00:13:54,Now this is now your circle stories get started.
213,00:13:54,00:14:00,The story keeps changing till you don't know what the truth is or whose story it was to begin with.
214,00:14:01,00:14:11,"So, uh, so the suspects saw that we were kind of distracted helping Bell, and they took the opportunity."
215,00:14:11,00:14:13,"I went on foot pursuit, you know."
216,00:14:13,00:14:19,"They, uh... I can't run as fast as I used to, I mean, so I lost them."
217,00:14:19,00:14:23,But that's when I heard the two shots.
218,00:14:23,00:14:30,"No, I heard shots coming from... the east."
219,00:14:30,00:14:31,How many?
220,00:14:31,00:14:33,Three.
221,00:14:36,00:14:40,OFFICER: Get down! (four gunshots)
222,00:14:40,00:14:43,Four.
223,00:14:43,00:14:47,And they sound a lot louder than a nine-millimeter.
224,00:14:50,00:14:52,The suspect had a gun in his hand.
225,00:14:52,00:14:54,"Oh, yeah, definitely."
226,00:14:54,00:14:55,I kicked it away when I cuffed him.
227,00:14:57,00:14:58,Did you fire any shots in the alley?
228,00:14:58,00:15:00,I didn't have to.
229,00:15:00,00:15:03,"Captain, hand over your firearm to CSI Willows."
230,00:15:07,00:15:09,Any magazines?
231,00:15:09,00:15:10,Uh...
232,00:15:14,00:15:17,I must have used them..
233,00:15:23,00:15:33,WILLOWS: Captain Brass's service pistol was received with an empty magazine and one live round in the chamber.
234,00:15:33,00:15:35,Well...
235,00:15:35,00:15:38,It'd be smart to have ammo before you go running into a gunfight.
236,00:15:45,00:15:50,I didn't find any cartridge casings in this alley from the dead guy's gun.
237,00:15:50,00:15:53,Just these three nine-millimeters from our cop.
238,00:15:56,00:15:57,So he must have been out of ammo.
239,00:15:58,00:16:01,"Yeah, but he had to know that he'd get shot holding a gun whether it was loaded or not."
240,00:16:01,00:16:03,Why didn't he just toss it?
241,00:16:03,00:16:05,Maybe he didn't know he was out. Heat of the battle.
242,00:16:05,00:16:06,"I mean, we're not talking rocket scientists."
243,00:16:08,00:16:10,"That doesn't make him suicidal, though, does it?"
244,00:16:22,00:16:25,"Officer Adams, I'm sorry for your loss."
245,00:16:25,00:16:28,If you'd like a few minutes to say good-bye...
246,00:16:53,00:16:54,"Okay, partner..."
247,00:16:58,00:17:00,I guess I was pretty rough on you.
248,00:17:00,00:17:03,Maybe not rough enough.
249,00:17:07,00:17:09,You're the best rookie I ever trained.
250,00:17:12,00:17:16,I have to leave you now.
251,00:17:16,00:17:19,"I'll, uh, I'll talk to Tracy."
252,00:17:19,00:17:23,Try to make her understand.
253,00:17:23,00:17:25,Drop in on the kids.
254,00:17:29,00:17:31,You were a good cop.
255,00:17:37,00:17:40,CAVALIERE: Geraldo Zamesca. High school football star.
256,00:17:40,00:17:41,Full scholarship to USC.
257,00:17:41,00:17:44,Got a bullet lodged in his spine Condition's critical.
258,00:17:44,00:17:46,Can we get the bullet?
259,00:17:46,00:17:49,Not unless his condition improves or he dies.
260,00:17:49,00:17:52,SWAT guys going house-to-house breaking down doors.
261,00:17:52,00:17:53,They're the ones who found him.
262,00:17:53,00:17:55,"They were going to blame us for this, too."
263,00:17:55,00:17:57,CSI's processed the scene?
264,00:17:57,00:18:02,Not much to process. Some blood stains off the ground Nine-millimeter cartridge case.
265,00:18:02,00:18:06,Cops are shooting nines.
266,00:18:06,00:18:07,Guilty until proven innocent.
267,00:18:09,00:18:10,"DANILO: This is my wife, Geraldo's mother."
268,00:18:11,00:18:13,We want nothing but the best for our son.
269,00:18:13,00:18:15,"That means we will decide if you go in and get the bullet, not the police."
270,00:18:15,00:18:17,DANILO: You got that?
271,00:18:20,00:18:22,Kid's family?
272,00:18:23,00:18:24,Yeah.
273,00:18:24,00:18:30,"Danilo Zamesca, a local business man that lives in the 'hood, but dines uptown."
274,00:18:30,00:18:33,(camera shutter clicking)
275,00:18:33,00:18:36,WOMAN: Perro porque la policia le disparo aqui nuestra casa?
276,00:18:36,00:18:38,Nosotros no hicimos nada.
277,00:18:38,00:18:40,Porque la policia nos disparo?
278,00:18:40,00:18:43,I-I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish.
279,00:18:43,00:18:45,"Que... no entiende, que..."
280,00:18:45,00:18:46,Nos hubiera matado.
281,00:18:46,00:18:48,Die algo para que ella entienda.
282,00:18:48,00:18:51,She wants to know why our house got shot at.
283,00:18:55,00:18:58,I don't have the answer to that. I'm sorry.
284,00:18:58,00:19:01,Es que usted no me puede decir nada?
285,00:19:01,00:19:02,No vio lo que hicieron?
286,00:19:02,00:19:03,Que si fueran mis hijos?
287,00:19:03,00:19:05,Que voy hacer sin mis hijos?
288,00:19:06,00:19:08,(sobbing)
289,00:19:29,00:19:31,"So, what do you think that is?"
290,00:19:31,00:19:34,"Well, it's not blood, it's not rust."
291,00:19:34,00:19:36,Where did Grissom find that?
292,00:19:36,00:19:37,In an alley off Third.
293,00:19:38,00:19:43,"'Cause see, those scrapes and gauges look like road rash."
294,00:19:43,00:19:45,Like when you toss a gun out of a moving car.
295,00:19:49,00:19:51,You'd be the one to know about rashes.
296,00:20:22,00:20:23,"That's my brother, man!"
297,00:20:23,00:20:24,What'd he do?!
298,00:20:24,00:20:26,My baby! My baby!
299,00:20:26,00:20:28,You killed my son!
300,00:20:28,00:20:30,My baby!
301,00:20:30,00:20:33,You cops murdered my son!
302,00:20:33,00:20:36,"Miss, You murdered my son! calm down, okay?"
303,00:20:36,00:20:39,I'm sorry for your loss. I'm with the crime lab.
304,00:20:39,00:20:41,Talk to one of the detectives. Miss...
305,00:20:41,00:20:42,I don't need to!
306,00:20:42,00:20:44,"Look, police brutality! He's hitting me!"
307,00:20:44,00:20:46,"Can I get some backup here, please?"
308,00:20:54,00:20:55,"Now you want my other son, huh?"
309,00:20:55,00:20:56,Is that what you want?
310,00:20:56,00:20:58,I just want to do my job here.
311,00:20:58,00:21:01,"What, lie for the police department?"
312,00:21:01,00:21:04,Can we lock this place up and move that crime tape down another block?
313,00:21:04,00:21:06,"OFFICER: Officer Mitchell, come into the west alley."
314,00:21:06,00:21:09,Bring two uniforms with you.
315,00:21:09,00:21:12,"These people think if they catch us doing something wrong, they sue and win the lottery."
316,00:21:12,00:21:15,"Yeah. We don't do anything wrong, we got nothing to worry about."
317,00:21:21,00:21:23,My son should be in school today.
318,00:21:23,00:21:25,He should be playing football.
319,00:21:25,00:21:29,"Instead, he's lying in a hospital bed."
320,00:21:29,00:21:31,Why?
321,00:21:31,00:21:34,Because the cops decided to shoot first and ask questions later.
322,00:21:34,00:21:39,Anybody remember the last time the police had a running gun battle down the Strip?
323,00:21:39,00:21:42,No? That's 'cause it's never happened.
324,00:21:42,00:21:43,Summerlin? Never.
325,00:21:43,00:21:45,Seven Hills?
326,00:21:46,00:21:47,No way.
327,00:21:47,00:21:49,"But down here, hey.."
328,00:21:49,00:21:51,(sobbing)
329,00:21:51,00:21:56,"My son, Geraldo, was a good boy."
330,00:21:56,00:21:59,He was a great football player.
331,00:21:59,00:22:01,Fearless out there.
332,00:22:01,00:22:06,He had a chance to do something with his life.
333,00:22:06,00:22:08,To be better than his father.
334,00:22:08,00:22:10,And now...
335,00:22:10,00:22:14,I may outlive my son.
336,00:22:14,00:22:21,Because the police shot him before he could tell them who he was.
337,00:22:21,00:22:25,Before he could tell them he was an honor student.
338,00:22:25,00:22:38,"I want to invite everybody here who cares about what happens in the community to come to Queen of Angels tonight, 6:00 p.m., to pray for Geraldo's life."
339,00:22:38,00:22:45,"And I want to say out loud, right now, to Sheriff Burdick, this will not stand."
340,00:22:45,00:22:48,"You, sir, will be held to answer."
341,00:22:49,00:22:53,I mean it.
342,00:22:53,00:22:54,I'm not going away.
343,00:22:55,00:23:00,A police spokesman confirms that department officials are looking into all allegations of brutality and misconduct.
344,00:23:00,00:23:02,Sheriff Burdick could not be reached for comment.
345,00:23:03,00:23:05,Here is what we know so far...
346,00:23:05,00:23:07,Nobody gives a crap about a dead officer.
347,00:23:07,00:23:10,I don't see them lighting candles for Bell.
348,00:23:11,00:23:12,...this morning with a car chase.
349,00:23:12,00:23:18,The pursuit ended in a shootout at Jefferson and 3rd Street between a heavily armed suspects and police.
350,00:23:18,00:23:27,WILLOWS: Detective Curtis' service pistol was received with one magazine containing three live rounds and one live round in the chamber.
351,00:23:27,00:23:31,"During the gun battle, were you aware of the other officers positions relative to you?"
352,00:23:31,00:23:35,They were in front of me and... and to my right.
353,00:23:35,00:23:37,"No, my left."
354,00:23:37,00:23:41,Did you continue to be aware of their positions after the suspect took off running?
355,00:23:43,00:23:47,(gunfire)
356,00:23:57,00:23:58,Uh...
357,00:23:58,00:24:02,Bell was in front of me...
358,00:24:02,00:24:04,but he was down behind his car.
359,00:24:04,00:24:07,Do you remember Officer Bell being shot?
360,00:24:25,00:24:27,Um...
361,00:24:29,00:24:32,"S-Sorry, what was the question?"
362,00:24:32,00:24:35,I asked if you remember Officer Bell being shot.
363,00:24:37,00:24:39,"Do you need a moment here? No, no, that's all right."
364,00:24:39,00:24:40,She's going to do just fine.
365,00:24:40,00:24:43,Uh...
366,00:24:47,00:24:49,Make sure you check Bell's vest.
367,00:24:49,00:24:52,I think he took one in the chest.
368,00:24:54,00:24:59,"Detective Ortega, Catherine, can you step out for a moment?"
369,00:25:03,00:25:05,We're not done.
370,00:25:10,00:25:13,So how are we doing on the suspect that got away?
371,00:25:13,00:25:14,Jose Fausto.
372,00:25:14,00:25:15,Identified through prints in the car.
373,00:25:15,00:25:17,He's got a long rap sheet.
374,00:25:17,00:25:18,Dogs lost his scent.
375,00:25:18,00:25:20,SWAT guys checked the building-- nothing.
376,00:25:20,00:25:22,Gang unit's beating the bushes.
377,00:25:22,00:25:26,Word on the street is we shot two unarmed men and a high school kid.
378,00:25:26,00:25:28,We got I.D.'s of all three dead suspects.
379,00:25:28,00:25:31,"Multiple felonies, drugs, immigration violations."
380,00:25:31,00:25:32,They're all members of the 18th Street Chucos.
381,00:25:33,00:25:37,Also driving a stolen car shooting automatic weapons at a police car.
382,00:25:37,00:25:39,These guys aren't exactly altar boys.
383,00:25:39,00:25:42,"West alley, I got eye-witnesses saw po-po plant the gun."
384,00:25:42,00:25:47,"East alley, I got an old lady who swears she saw Ricardo Estevez with his hands raised before he was killed."
385,00:25:47,00:25:48,These witnesses credible?
386,00:25:48,00:25:50,I don't know.
387,00:25:50,00:25:54,"Listen, if the suspects don't have guns in their hands, we can't shoot them."
388,00:25:54,00:25:56,"Well, let's not get ahead of the evidence."
389,00:25:56,00:25:57,"CAVALIERE: Okay, one more thing."
390,00:25:58,00:26:01,The family of Leandro Chavez is suing the department for wrongful death.
391,00:26:01,00:26:03,Claims we delayed treatment.
392,00:26:17,00:26:22,Medium caliber bullet-- transected the femoral artery.
393,00:26:22,00:26:24,Major artery. Fatal wound.
394,00:26:24,00:26:25,(gunshot)
395,00:26:25,00:26:26,(screaming)
396,00:26:26,00:26:29,Take a look. What's missing?
397,00:26:31,00:26:35,All of the organs seem to be in the right place.
398,00:26:35,00:26:36,Look closer.
399,00:26:37,00:26:38,Okay.
400,00:26:39,00:26:40,Kidneys are...
401,00:26:40,00:26:43,a bit pale.
402,00:26:43,00:26:44,Liver is light tan.
403,00:26:44,00:26:45,Right.
404,00:26:45,00:26:47,Not a lot of blood.
405,00:26:49,00:26:50,Dead at the scene.
406,00:26:50,00:26:51,He bled out.
407,00:26:51,00:26:52,Bingo.
408,00:26:52,00:26:55,The wound was not immediately fatal.
409,00:26:55,00:26:56,It took a while.
410,00:26:56,00:26:58,This is going to look bad.
411,00:26:58,00:27:00,"David, it is what it is."
412,00:27:07,00:27:09,Why did you leave a downed officer?
413,00:27:11,00:27:16,Sergeant Adams told me he had the situation under control.
414,00:27:16,00:27:22,"So I went to back up Officer Davis, who ran off in..."
415,00:27:22,00:27:24,this direction.
416,00:27:24,00:27:26,I caught up with him here.
417,00:27:28,00:27:30,(click)
418,00:27:30,00:27:32,Davis' slide was locked back.
419,00:27:32,00:27:34,He was out of ammo.
420,00:27:34,00:27:37,So the suspect had a gun pointed at Officer Davis.
421,00:27:43,00:27:45,Of course.
422,00:27:48,00:27:50,That was why I fired.
423,00:27:55,00:27:56,100% sure?
424,00:27:58,00:28:00,Yes.
425,00:28:01,00:28:02,What did you do next?
426,00:28:05,00:28:06,What are you doing? Put it down.
427,00:28:06,00:28:08,"Yeah, sorry. I was just trying to secure his gun."
428,00:28:08,00:28:10,"Okay, he's not going to be using it anymore."
429,00:28:10,00:28:15,"Officer Davis was acting on survival instinct, not training."
430,00:28:15,00:28:20,It was understandable under the circumstances.
431,00:28:20,00:28:23,I don't think so.
432,00:28:45,00:28:48,Want a ride?
433,00:28:48,00:28:52,"No, I'm just going to go home."
434,00:28:52,00:28:54,You sure?
435,00:28:54,00:28:57,Yeah.
436,00:29:28,00:29:30,(sliding click)
437,00:30:00,00:30:08,"Okay, the first communication I received from Three-David-34 was at 06:43:37."
438,00:30:08,00:30:11,This is Three-David-34 requesting immediate backup.
439,00:30:11,00:30:18,"New suspect vehicle Adam-Robert-Charlie-208, Nevada, dark Chevy Caprice, four suspects."
440,00:30:18,00:30:20,Suspects are armed.
441,00:30:20,00:30:21,"WOMAN: Copy, Three-David-34."
442,00:30:21,00:30:24,"What did Bell mean by ""new suspect vehicle""?"
443,00:30:24,00:30:29,Can you take it back to the last communication before that call?
444,00:30:29,00:30:32,"Control, this is Three-David-34."
445,00:30:32,00:30:39,"We'll be 487, 12000 block of Roosevelt on David-Nora-Charlie-130, Buick Regal."
446,00:30:41,00:30:44,WILLOWS: A 487 is a traffic stop.
447,00:30:44,00:30:45,You were pulling over a Buick?
448,00:30:45,00:30:46,That's correct.
449,00:30:46,00:30:48,Why'd you leave the Buick and start following the Caprice?
450,00:30:48,00:30:49,Didn't leave the Buick.
451,00:30:49,00:30:50,The Caprice cut in.
452,00:30:50,00:30:53,(siren wailing)
453,00:30:55,00:30:57,Why'd he do that? Don't know.
454,00:30:57,00:30:59,"The next thing I know, we were taking fire."
455,00:30:59,00:31:01,Forgot all about the Buick.
456,00:31:01,00:31:03,WILLOWS: Did you see where it went?
457,00:31:03,00:31:04,I was kind of busy.
458,00:31:14,00:31:16,"Hey, you done yet?"
459,00:31:17,00:31:20,"Grissom, am I on overtime?"
460,00:31:20,00:31:22,Of course.
461,00:31:22,00:31:24,Did everyone else go home?
462,00:31:24,00:31:25,No.
463,00:31:25,00:31:26,Good to know.
464,00:31:27,00:31:30,"Well, I finished about ten blocks so far."
465,00:31:30,00:31:34,That's 98 cartridge cases.
466,00:31:34,00:31:39,"Let's see-- double L, A to Z's 26, That's 38 bullet impacts."
467,00:31:39,00:31:40,Good.
468,00:31:40,00:31:42,Pursuit started ten blocks farther down.
469,00:31:42,00:31:43,You're halfway done.
470,00:31:43,00:31:46,I've got like three or four hours more work left.
471,00:31:46,00:31:47,Can I have some help?
472,00:31:47,00:31:49,Everybody's busy.
473,00:31:49,00:31:51,I think you missed one.
474,00:31:58,00:32:00,(phone ringing)
475,00:32:02,00:32:03,Grissom.
476,00:32:03,00:32:04,Hey.
477,00:32:04,00:32:06,I just interviewed Sergeant Adams.
478,00:32:06,00:32:09,He and Bell were making a routine traffic stop when the Caprice cut in.
479,00:32:09,00:32:10,The initial vehicle was a...
480,00:32:10,00:32:12,A Buick?
481,00:32:12,00:32:14,I hate it when you do that.
482,00:32:14,00:32:16,Lucky guess.
483,00:32:16,00:32:18,I'll call you back.
484,00:32:19,00:32:22,How'd you know that hubcap was connected to the case?
485,00:32:22,00:32:24,"I'm a trained observer, Greg."
486,00:32:24,00:32:25,"No, really."
487,00:32:25,00:32:30,How long do you think a perfectly good hubcap like this would sit around out here?
488,00:32:30,00:32:33,There's a freeway on-ramp about two blocks away.
489,00:32:33,00:32:36,Check and see if there's any traffic cams between here and there.
490,00:32:36,00:32:38,"You know, you scare me sometimes."
491,00:32:38,00:32:39,It's kind of freaky.
492,00:32:39,00:32:42,You ever bet on the ponies?
493,00:32:42,00:32:43,I prefer poker.
494,00:32:43,00:32:45,Horses are hard to control.
495,00:32:47,00:32:50,Make sure you document these skid marks.
496,00:32:50,00:32:53,"He said ""skid marks."" (snickering)"
497,00:32:53,00:32:55,(gunshot)
498,00:32:57,00:32:59,Oh-ho-ho! Yeah!
499,00:32:59,00:33:01,That's what I'm talking about.
500,00:33:01,00:33:04,I got over firing AK's a long time ago.
501,00:33:09,00:33:14,"Hey... Mustache Boy, come over here and check this out."
502,00:33:16,00:33:17,Get a load of that.
503,00:33:20,00:33:24,Whoa.
504,00:33:24,00:33:27,What are the chances of that happening? Like one in a million.
505,00:33:29,00:33:32,The bullet jammed this cylinder.
506,00:33:33,00:33:35,"You know, I couldn't clear this gun at the scene."
507,00:33:35,00:33:37,I should've noticed these bullet fragments.
508,00:33:37,00:33:39,I guess I got distracted.
509,00:33:39,00:33:43,"Well, the bullet had to come from Officer Davis's pistol..."
510,00:33:43,00:33:47,"but if you're the suspect, don't you know your gun's getting hit?"
511,00:33:47,00:33:50,I think it would have felt like a normal recoil.
512,00:33:50,00:33:53,"Besides, it was like the Wild West out there."
513,00:33:53,00:33:56,You don't have to tellme; I know it was crazy out there.
514,00:33:56,00:33:59,"You know, I pulled 78 bullets out of one car."
515,00:33:59,00:34:02,Davis just got lucky.
516,00:34:02,00:34:05,This suspect had one live round left.
517,00:34:05,00:34:07,It saved Davis's life.
518,00:34:07,00:34:08,"Well, there you go."
519,00:34:08,00:34:10,Proves he was pointing the gun at the officer.
520,00:34:10,00:34:13,See you in court; stroke one up for the good guys.
521,00:34:13,00:34:16,We still have to place it in Rosario's hand.
522,00:34:18,00:34:20,(woman sniffles)
523,00:34:22,00:34:25,"This is, uh, Gil Grissom from the Crime Lab."
524,00:34:25,00:34:27,This is Officer Bell's wife.
525,00:34:27,00:34:32,"Mrs. Bell, I'm so sorry about the loss of your husband-- he was a fine man. (sobs)"
526,00:34:32,00:34:34,(sobbing)
527,00:34:34,00:34:36,Why are they crying?
528,00:34:36,00:34:39,"McKEEN: Um, why don't I drive you home."
529,00:34:39,00:34:42,They're crying for the man that killed my husband.
530,00:34:42,00:34:43,What did you say? You heard me.
531,00:34:43,00:34:47,"If you did a better job of raising your son, I wouldn't be here."
532,00:34:47,00:34:49,Don't you tell me how to raise my children! You should be ashamed!
533,00:34:50,00:34:51,(man shouting in Spanish)
534,00:34:51,00:34:52,How dare you!
535,00:35:03,00:35:04,(gunshot)
536,00:35:35,00:35:37,You run the gauntlet?
537,00:35:37,00:35:39,Yeah.
538,00:35:39,00:35:41,Ferro-tracing his hands?
539,00:35:41,00:35:42,Yeah.
540,00:35:42,00:35:45,I'm trying to prove Rosario here held the gun.
541,00:35:45,00:35:48,Good old pyridyldiphenyl triazine.
542,00:35:48,00:35:52,I'm hoping this stuff reacts to the traces of iron that may have been left on his skin.
543,00:35:52,00:35:55,It'll further refute any argument that the gun was a plant.
544,00:36:00,00:36:03,GRISSOM: That could be the back strap of a gun.
545,00:36:03,00:36:07,Yeah. That would do it.
546,00:36:12,00:36:15,"Detective, do you have a moment?"
547,00:36:15,00:36:17,"Uh, yeah, I'm kind of busy-- what is it?"
548,00:36:17,00:36:21,"I picked up a junkie for possession, outside a fleabag motel off Fremont."
549,00:36:21,00:36:22,And what?
550,00:36:22,00:36:25,"And... last night, he spotted your shooter."
551,00:36:30,00:36:33,Let's talk to him.
552,00:36:36,00:36:37,You know this guy?
553,00:36:38,00:36:39,What if I do?
554,00:36:39,00:36:41,What'll it get me?
555,00:36:42,00:36:44,He's a cop killer. Gets you nothing.
556,00:36:44,00:36:46,"Hey, no need to get hostile."
557,00:36:46,00:36:48,"Hey, man, you don't know what hostile is."
558,00:36:51,00:36:52,Will it at least get me a ride home?
559,00:36:53,00:36:55,"(quietly): Come on... Okay, okay."
560,00:36:55,00:36:58,I-I do a lot of business at the Lucky Seven Motel.
561,00:36:58,00:37:01,And that guy checked in last night.
562,00:37:01,00:37:05,He scored a little something to help get him some sleep.
563,00:37:05,00:37:07,But he didn't pay.
564,00:37:07,00:37:09,He just flashed his piece.
565,00:37:09,00:37:10,Nine-millimeter?
566,00:37:10,00:37:12,Yeah.
567,00:37:12,00:37:18,"He wanted a... a girl, and I gave him a number."
568,00:37:18,00:37:20,That dude's bad news.
569,00:37:22,00:37:24,I want to give him to you.
570,00:37:26,00:37:27,Glad you're here.
571,00:37:27,00:37:30,I'd like to get this one off my table.
572,00:37:30,00:37:35,Found a rather large contusion on the left chest just below the nipple.
573,00:37:35,00:37:40,"Well, that location is consistent with the bullet Catherine found embedded in his vest. It's like getting kicked by a mule."
574,00:37:40,00:37:42,You'll want to see this.
575,00:37:42,00:37:44,Through-and-through.
576,00:37:44,00:37:52,"Entrance wound just below his left ear, exited below and to the front of his right ear, severing the right common carotid."
577,00:37:52,00:37:53,(gunshot)
578,00:37:53,00:37:55,"(gasps, grunts)"
579,00:37:55,00:37:57,That's your C.O.D.
580,00:37:57,00:38:00,"Fortunately, he never felt a thing."
581,00:38:03,00:38:06,"Left to right, back to front."
582,00:38:06,00:38:07,Mm-hmm.
583,00:38:07,00:38:10,Only cops were shooting in that direction.
584,00:38:10,00:38:13,Are you saying Bell was hit by friendly fire?
585,00:38:13,00:38:15,Maybe not so friendly.
586,00:38:34,00:38:35,Who's in the room?
587,00:38:36,00:38:37,"Some john, I don't know. Shh!"
588,00:38:37,00:38:40,Is that him? Mm-hmm.
589,00:38:40,00:38:42,I couldn't wait to get out of there.
590,00:38:42,00:38:44,He was acting real nervous.
591,00:38:44,00:38:46,Now I know why.
592,00:38:46,00:38:48,I took care of him; he's asleep.
593,00:38:48,00:38:50,"So you're not gonna bustme,right?"
594,00:38:50,00:38:52,Take her out of here.
595,00:38:55,00:38:56,(officers shouting)
596,00:38:56,00:38:58,Police! Let me see your hands!
597,00:38:58,00:38:59,Do it now!
598,00:38:59,00:39:00,Get on the floor!
599,00:39:00,00:39:01,Down!
600,00:39:07,00:39:10,That's our guy.
601,00:39:18,00:39:20,He's carrying a nine.
602,00:39:20,00:39:21,MAN: Clear.
603,00:39:23,00:39:27,We'll run this gun against the cartridge case from the poor kid on the bike.
604,00:39:27,00:39:31,"I'm guessing you didn't save up for that one, huh?"
605,00:39:33,00:39:35,(two gunshots) (yells)
606,00:39:35,00:39:38,You shoot an innocent kid in the back just to take his bike?
607,00:39:38,00:39:40,You piece of crap! Get up!
608,00:39:40,00:39:42,"Hey, you're gonna wish you kept running."
609,00:39:42,00:39:45,"They hate cop killers in Vegas, you hear me? Huh?"
610,00:39:45,00:39:47,"Come on, let me get dressed up first, huh?"
611,00:39:47,00:39:50,"We got a jumpsuit just your size, don't worry."
612,00:39:51,00:39:55,(indistinct conversations)
613,00:40:05,00:40:07,(gunshot) (Fausto yells)
614,00:40:07,00:40:09,Down! Everybody down! Down!
615,00:40:13,00:40:14,Where did that come from?
