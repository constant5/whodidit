0	00:00:43	00:00:44	Stop. Stop. You're killing me.
1	00:00:44	00:00:46	Are you freaking deaf?
2	00:00:46	00:00:48	I said stop! Kill the playback!
3	00:00:48	00:00:57	(music stops) Look, this might win second prize at the talent contest at Spiro Agnew High School in Bad Limp, Arkansas...
4	00:00:57	00:00:58	Hey, Drew.
5	00:00:59	00:01:00	It's not my kid's fault.
6	00:01:00	00:01:02	Who let Daddy Dearest on the stage?
7	00:01:02	00:01:04	I gave specific orders...
8	00:01:04	00:01:07	Everybody's moving around like there's nothing important going on.
9	00:01:07	00:01:08	How about a little respect, okay?
10	00:01:08	00:01:11	Except for your kid doesn't deserve respect.
11	00:01:11	00:01:13	Lazy little prima donna.
12	00:01:14	00:01:16	Maybe you should sit with the losers.
13	00:01:17	00:01:18	Let me try it again.
14	00:01:18	00:01:19	You don't care.
15	00:01:19	00:01:23	I do so care-- this isn't a game to me, all right? I'm a good singer.
16	00:01:23	00:01:25	It's all I've ever wanted to do, and you have no right...
17	00:01:25	00:01:27	There! That passion.
18	00:01:27	00:01:29	That's what I want to see when you sing.
19	00:01:30	00:01:31	Now, let's do it again.
20	00:01:31	00:01:32	And watch your pitch, baby.
21	00:01:32	00:01:34	Too early in the day to be that flat.
22	00:01:34	00:01:36	I know I wasn't flat.
23	00:01:36	00:01:38	Oh, yes, you were.
24	00:01:38	00:01:40	The name of this show is Overnight Sensation.
25	00:01:40	00:01:44	For God sakes, show me something sensational!
26	00:01:44	00:01:46	Playback!
27	00:01:50	00:01:51	Flat!
28	00:01:52	00:01:54	Pitch, baby, pitch.
29	00:01:59	00:02:01	Pitch!
30	00:02:01	00:02:03	I can't take this!
31	00:02:03	00:02:09	You tell us to feel everything, but you don't feel anything.
32	00:02:09	00:02:11	I can't... I can't do this.
33	00:02:12	00:02:13	Layla.
34	00:02:13	00:02:14	(crying) What?
35	00:02:14	00:02:15	Rehearsal's not over.
36	00:02:15	00:02:17	Layla, wait!
37	00:02:20	00:02:22	Playback!
38	00:03:22	00:03:28	00 and 4 She was Lindsey's favorite on the show.
39	00:03:28	00:03:31	We voted for her six times last week.
40	00:03:33	00:03:35	They make it to Vegas for the finals.
41	00:03:35	00:03:36	Every kid watching wants to be them.
42	00:03:37	00:03:39	It just... it shouldn't end like this.
43	00:03:39	00:03:41	Glamorous makeup.
44	00:03:41	00:03:43	Fancy lingerie.
45	00:03:44	00:03:46	Sex fetish that went too far?
46	00:03:46	00:03:49	Perverted idol worship?
47	00:03:49	00:03:51	Wholesome all-American girl.
48	00:03:51	00:03:54	Did you do an SAE kit?
49	00:03:54	00:03:57	Not yet.
50	00:03:57	00:04:04	She may have gotten what she wished for-- she's an overnight sensation now.
51	00:04:34	00:04:41	It's part of the gruesome perversity of this business that the ratings will be through the roof on our final show.
52	00:04:41	00:04:45	So as a tribute to Layla, let's do what she'd want us to do.
53	00:04:45	00:04:46	Yeah.
54	00:04:46	00:04:48	Let's make it our best show ever, okay?
55	00:04:48	00:04:49	Rehearsal!
56	00:04:49	00:04:51	Excuse me?
57	00:04:51	00:04:53	You're Drew Rich, the producer?
58	00:04:53	00:04:54	Who are you?
59	00:04:54	00:04:56	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
60	00:04:56	00:04:59	We're trying to confirm the whereabouts of Layla Wells last night.
61	00:04:59	00:05:01	Can you help us?
62	00:05:01	00:05:02	00.
63	00:05:02	00:05:06	Went back to her room, as far as I know.
64	00:05:06	00:05:09	Chaperone says she called at midnight, said she was going to bed.
65	00:05:09	00:05:10	Where's the chaperone?
66	00:05:10	00:05:11	Fired her this morning.
67	00:05:11	00:05:13	Obviously, she wasn't doing her job.
68	00:05:13	00:05:20	Okay. Layla's an emancipated minor, but her chaperone's supposed to be looking out for her, not pumping per diem into a slot machine all night.
69	00:05:20	00:05:21	This means you won, Kip.
70	00:05:21	00:05:23	You're the champion.
71	00:05:23	00:05:24	No, he's not.
72	00:05:24	00:05:25	Ajaya!
73	00:05:26	00:05:28	Last one voted off.
74	00:05:28	00:05:30	You're back on against Kip.
75	00:05:30	00:05:33	We're gonna need contact information from Miss Wells's family.
76	00:05:33	00:05:34	Michelle can get it to you.
77	00:05:35	00:05:36	Now, I have a show to produce.
78	00:05:36	00:05:38	Call editing.
79	00:05:38	00:05:43	I want a DVD of every frame we have on Layla on my desk, one hour. Okay.
80	00:05:43	00:05:47	If this was a killer that fetishized her, why not just dump the body?
81	00:05:47	00:05:51	Why bother to wrap her up? To conceal the body during transport from the primary.
82	00:05:52	00:05:55	It's consistent with those knots being tied into a handle.
83	00:05:55	00:05:58	You know, the looping here looks like a reef knot.
84	00:05:58	00:06:01	Might be looking for somebody with some sailing experience.
85	00:06:05	00:06:07	Rancho Linen Service.
86	00:06:07	00:06:09	They deliver to every hotel on the Strip.
87	00:06:09	00:06:12	Been around since Bugsy Siegel's days.
88	00:06:12	00:06:15	Which is probably the last time this tablecloth was washed.
89	00:06:15	00:06:20	These discolorations suggest that this has been on somebody's table a long time.
90	00:06:20	00:06:22	What was Layla doing here?
91	00:06:22	00:06:27	She had a great room at the Palermo, people waiting on her day and night.
92	00:06:27	00:06:30	You ever been in one of those suites?
93	00:06:30	00:06:31	Just to get evidence.
94	00:06:33	00:06:35	I sure wouldn't leave there for...
95	00:06:35	00:06:37	whatever this is.
96	00:06:41	00:06:44	Couple of blood drops.
97	00:06:44	00:06:47	There's no trail.
98	00:06:47	00:06:49	Probably dripped through the cloth.
99	00:06:53	00:06:56	These wheel tracks are 11 inches apart.
100	00:06:59	00:07:01	It couldn't have been a grocery cart.
101	00:07:01	00:07:05	The front wheels are narrower than the back, so it would've left two different sets of tracks.
102	00:07:05	00:07:12	Something tells me a guy pushing any kind of cart in this area wouldn't be that unusual.
103	00:07:16	00:07:21	That blunt-force trauma just below the rib cage is your C.O.D.
104	00:07:21	00:07:22	Lacerated the liver.
105	00:07:22	00:07:25	Hangs lower when the body's upright.
106	00:07:25	00:07:30	Since no ribs were impacted, she was standing when the blow occurred.
107	00:07:33	00:07:36	Death would have occurred fairly quickly.
108	00:07:36	00:07:40	Any indication of sexual assault?
109	00:07:40	00:07:48	No. However, when I was doing the internal exam, I found an embryo implanted in the uterine wall, maybe 20 millimeters long.
110	00:07:48	00:07:50	She was pregnant.
111	00:07:50	00:07:51	About eight weeks.
112	00:07:51	00:07:53	I sent cord tissue to DNA.
113	00:07:53	00:07:57	So maybe this isn't just a case of negligent chaperone.
114	00:07:57	00:07:59	Maybe it's motive.
115	00:08:12	00:08:15	Got a reading? Yeah.
116	00:08:15	00:08:21	So, the Lock Interrogator says that Layla last used her key card 12 p.m.
117	00:08:21	00:08:24	That's right after she walked out of rehearsal. Hm.
118	00:08:24	00:08:33	Now, according to the hotel phone records, she made two calls-- one to Drew Rich's room 34 p.m. Probably to apologize.
119	00:08:33	00:08:35	And the other one to her chaperone to say good night around midnight.
120	00:08:35	00:08:36	Went to voice mail.
121	00:08:36	00:08:43	Casino surveillance says that the chaperone stayed up all night trying to win a progressive.
122	00:08:44	00:08:49	00 on, she was looking up abortion clinics.
123	00:08:50	00:08:55	It looks like she had a change of heart; started checking out adoption agencies.
124	00:08:55	00:08:58	Huh. Sounds like a confused kid.
125	00:09:03	00:09:09	Well, it looks like they're a cute couple, I'll give you that, but what I don't get is why anybody wants to watch that show-- I don't.
126	00:09:09	00:09:10	It's a talent contest?
127	00:09:10	00:09:12	It's more like a humiliation ritual.
128	00:09:12	00:09:13	Well, you'd know about that.
129	00:09:13	00:09:15	All right.
130	00:09:15	00:09:22	So, you want to know why that kid Ajaya with the fluffy hair, sings like a hinge, why he got into the semifinals? Hm?
131	00:09:22	00:09:27	Me and 10,000 other guys vote for him every week on the Internet.
132	00:09:28	00:09:31	But if you don't watch, how do you know about him?
133	00:09:31	00:09:34	Oh, you know, water cooler talk, gossip.
134	00:09:34	00:09:36	Mm. Right.
135	00:09:36	00:09:37	Well...
136	00:09:37	00:09:39	here's something the gossips don't have.
137	00:09:41	00:09:44	Okay, there's the humiliator.
138	00:09:44	00:09:48	Layla left the Palermo, too, just after midnight.
139	00:09:48	00:09:51	Two minutes later...
140	00:09:51	00:09:54	Kip follows.
141	00:09:54	00:09:59	It must've been pretty hard for you and Layla to find some time together.
142	00:09:59	00:10:04	You know, can't get your mojo workin' when Daddy's lurkin'.
143	00:10:04	00:10:06	So what did you do?
144	00:10:06	00:10:10	You waited till midnight, Dad's asleep, and you take separate elevators down.
145	00:10:10	00:10:12	Then what?
146	00:10:12	00:10:13	Layla was found in a pretty tough neighborhood.
147	00:10:13	00:10:17	What were you doing over there, scoring drugs? He doesn't do drugs.
148	00:10:17	00:10:18	Or maybe it was to get a back-alley abortion.
149	00:10:18	00:10:20	What?
150	00:10:20	00:10:22	Layla was eight weeks pregnant-- am I right?
151	00:10:22	00:10:24	And who's the daddy?
152	00:10:24	00:10:25	You?
153	00:10:26	00:10:27	The hell it was.
154	00:10:27	00:10:29	I'm not talking to you.
155	00:10:29	00:10:31	Kip... Just shut up. Just... shut up.
156	00:10:32	00:10:33	We're going to need a DNA sample.
157	00:10:33	00:10:34	No way. You're done abusing my kid.
158	00:10:34	00:10:35	And so are you.
159	00:10:35	00:10:37	Sit down. Take him out in the hall.
160	00:10:37	00:10:38	You can't do this.
161	00:10:38	00:10:41	Dad... Hey, check it out.
162	00:10:41	00:10:44	I've got you and Kip returning to the hotel after the time of the murder.
163	00:10:44	00:10:46	You're like a team, right?
164	00:10:46	00:10:48	You're in it together, 50-50.
165	00:10:48	00:10:52	You know, the contest, the career, and future earnings.
166	00:10:52	00:10:53	It's a lot of money.
167	00:10:53	00:10:54	And that's what this is about, right?
168	00:10:54	00:10:59	The money? 30 million people tune in to hear my kid sing every week.
169	00:10:59	00:11:01	How many people want to watch you?
170	00:11:01	00:11:04	So you're on the road four months?
171	00:11:04	00:11:06	How'd you work that out with your job?
172	00:11:06	00:11:07	I took a leave of absence.
173	00:11:10	00:11:13	Come on, sailor, you abandoned ship.
174	00:11:13	00:11:16	You quit your job, got a second mortgage on your house.
175	00:11:16	00:11:26	If Kip screws up, you're wiped out, so I can understand how you'd cover up for him, and maybe you're even desperate enough to kill her yourself.
176	00:11:31	00:11:33	So I ran that fetal cord tissue that Doc Robbins sent over.
177	00:11:33	00:11:41	I subtracted out the mother's profile, leaving what has to be the father's contribution, and it didn't match the sample from Kip Westerman.
178	00:11:41	00:11:43	So he's not the father of Layla's baby.
179	00:11:43	00:11:47	No, but then I ran those alleles through CODIS and...
180	00:11:47	00:11:49	I got a hit.
181	00:11:49	00:11:51	Marvin Fleck.
182	00:11:51	00:11:54	In the system from charges in North Carolina in 2002.
183	00:11:54	00:11:56	Mm-hmm.
184	00:11:56	00:11:57	Do you recognize Marvin?
185	00:11:57	00:11:59	Drew Rich?
186	00:11:59	00:12:06	Yeah, he had sex with a minor-- she was 15 years old-- but then she changed her story, so the charges were dropped.
187	00:12:06	00:12:08	Want to bet he paid her off?
188	00:12:08	00:12:11	Talent and ambition ran in Layla Wells's family.
189	00:12:11	00:12:16	Her grandmother Jasmine was a Las Vegas showgirl who gave Layla her first figure-skating classes.
190	00:12:16	00:12:23	Sadly, Layla's grandmother didn't live to see her come so close to becoming America's next Overnight Sensation.
191	00:12:23	00:12:25	My mama didn't approve of show business.
192	00:12:25	00:12:29	We were always fighting about it, so I went to live with my grandma.
193	00:12:29	00:12:32	Trim the ice ballet, give me some more shots where she's crying.
194	00:12:32	00:12:34	We need to see some more emotion, man.
195	00:12:35	00:12:36	Mr. Rich.
196	00:12:36	00:12:39	Later. Marvin.
197	00:12:43	00:12:46	15.
198	00:12:46	00:12:50	I went back to my room alone.
199	00:12:50	00:12:51	I needed some time to think.
200	00:12:51	00:12:54	Is thinking what got Layla pregnant?
201	00:12:54	00:12:58	These kids might seem like innocents, but they're not.
202	00:12:58	00:13:02	They are first-class manipulators with the survival instincts of a coyote.
203	00:13:02	00:13:10	I told Layla I'd pay for an abortion, and she agreed, as long as she won the competition.
204	00:13:10	00:13:11	I don't like being blackmailed.
205	00:13:11	00:13:16	Sounds like motive. Doesn't mean I killed her. We know you left the Palermo around midnight.
206	00:13:17	00:13:20	About 20 minutes later, your credit card was used at the Blue Madonna Motel.
207	00:13:20	00:13:21	I wasn't with Layla.
208	00:13:21	00:13:23	Her body was found three blocks from there.
209	00:13:23	00:13:25	You beat rape charges once.
210	00:13:25	00:13:27	Maybe you thought you wouldn't be so lucky a second time.
211	00:13:27	00:13:30	This is ridiculous. Look... I was with a hooker.
212	00:13:30	00:13:31	All right?
213	00:13:31	00:13:33	Layla was pregnant with your child.
214	00:13:33	00:13:34	That's statutory rape.
215	00:13:34	00:13:35	Age of consent in Nevada is 16.
216	00:13:35	00:13:38	No, have your lawyer look at the statute again.
217	00:13:38	00:13:45	There's an exception when a person is in a position of authority with a teenager-- like executive producer.
218	00:13:45	00:13:46	Come on, let's go.
219	00:13:49	00:13:50	Spermaceti.
220	00:13:50	00:13:52	An oil found in the heads of sperm whales.
221	00:13:53	00:13:55	Mm-hmm, and when it cools, it becomes a wax.
222	00:13:55	00:13:58	The lipstick that the dead girl was wearing had a spermaceti wax base.
223	00:13:58	00:14:01	There's been a ban on sperm whaling for 20 years.
224	00:14:01	00:14:03	Yeah, which means that the lipstick is very old.
225	00:14:03	00:14:07	You know, spermaceti is not the weirdest thing found in lipstick.
226	00:14:07	00:14:10	The ancient Greeks made theirs out of saliva, sheep sweat, and crocodile excrement.
227	00:14:10	00:14:15	Did any of the makeup in her hotel room contain spermaceti?
228	00:14:15	00:14:21	No, but there were intriguingly analogous results from, believe it or not... the tablecloth.
229	00:14:21	00:14:24	Take a look.
230	00:14:27	00:14:29	Asbestos?
231	00:14:29	00:14:32	Specific type of asbestos called amocite.
232	00:14:32	00:14:38	Its particles are bound together by vermiculite and cellulose, a combination found in spray-on ceilings.
233	00:14:38	00:14:41	That type of ceiling material hasn't been used in 20 or 30 years.
234	00:14:41	00:14:47	You know, it's as if your victim found a hole in the time-space continuum and was murdered decades ago.
235	00:14:47	00:14:50	Brilliant theory, Dave.
236	00:14:50	00:14:52	Thanks.
237	00:14:52	00:14:54	Thank you.
238	00:14:54	00:14:58	So this was the Strip 50 years ago.
239	00:14:58	00:15:00	The Vegas my dad came to.
240	00:15:00	00:15:03	Now, any one of the big hotels has more rooms than all these put together.
241	00:15:03	00:15:09	Nearly all the old casinos that Rancho Linen serviced have been torn down.
242	00:15:09	00:15:12	Except for this one, on the west side.
243	00:15:12	00:15:15	Where Layla's body was found.
244	00:15:19	00:15:21	Le ChÃ¢teau Rouge.
245	00:15:28	00:15:33	Man, last time I was this deep in the hood, I was on a case with Warrick.
246	00:15:39	00:15:41	Got some track marks here.
247	00:15:47	00:15:49	11 inches apart.
248	00:15:49	00:15:51	Same as the other ones I found.
249	00:16:00	00:16:02	Layla was wearing a pink sweater when she left the Palermo.
250	00:16:08	00:16:11	We have a crime scene.
251	00:16:11	00:16:12	No warrant needed.
252	00:16:14	00:16:18	If Layla did get inside, somebody locked up after her.
253	00:16:28	00:16:31	Wow.
254	00:16:31	00:16:34	It's like someone yelled fire 50 years ago, and nobody came back.
255	00:16:34	00:16:35	Yeah.
256	00:16:35	00:16:38	You can still feel it in the air.
257	00:16:38	00:16:40	Legends walked here.
258	00:16:40	00:16:44	Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Dinah Washington.
259	00:16:44	00:16:47	First integrated casino in town.
260	00:16:47	00:16:54	Place was smoking so hot every night, 30 a.m. show.
261	00:16:54	00:17:01	Sinatra, the Rat Pack-- all the white headliners and tourists came down from the Strip.
262	00:17:01	00:17:04	Place was swinging till dawn.
263	00:17:04	00:17:09	Then, six months after it opened, the joint closed overnight.
264	00:17:09	00:17:11	How come?
265	00:17:11	00:17:16	Rumor has it the Kansas City Mob didn't like the East Coast boys poaching their pigeons.
266	00:17:16	00:17:19	Back then, there were only eight or nine casinos on the Strip.
267	00:17:20	00:17:26	700 or 800 people were here instead of there, well, do the math.
268	00:17:26	00:17:28	This cart can match the tracks I found.
269	00:17:32	00:17:34	Rancho Linen Service.
270	00:17:40	00:17:42	Hey, give me some light over here, will you?
271	00:17:46	00:17:48	That's the only table without a tablecloth.
272	00:18:00	00:18:02	We've got blood.
273	00:18:05	00:18:09	Better call P.D., track down the owner of the building.
274	00:18:09	00:18:11	It's time to reopen Le ChÃ¢teau Rouge.
275	00:18:25	00:18:26	Whose car is that, man?
276	00:18:26	00:18:27	Building owner.
277	00:18:27	00:18:30	ChÃ¢teau Rouge, man.
278	00:18:30	00:18:32	My parents came here.
279	00:18:32	00:18:34	They still talk about it.
280	00:18:42	00:18:43	Good evening.
281	00:18:44	00:18:45	My name's Gil Grissom.
282	00:18:45	00:18:46	I'm with the Crime Lab.
283	00:18:46	00:18:50	Well, I hope your people are taking care with my property.
284	00:18:50	00:18:52	I understand it has quite a history.
285	00:18:53	00:18:54	You're too young to remember.
286	00:18:54	00:18:56	I've heard stories.
287	00:18:56	00:19:03	Wasn't there a night when Sammy Davis sang, and the only way they'd let him off the stage was if he took the whole crowd to breakfast?
288	00:19:03	00:19:05	More than once.
289	00:19:05	00:19:06	Come on in.
290	00:19:06	00:19:07	Have a drink.
291	00:19:07	00:19:09	Thank you, but I'm working.
292	00:19:09	00:19:12	Well, then you can watch me drink.
293	00:19:18	00:19:22	In Rome, they illuminate the ruins every night.
294	00:19:22	00:19:26	The Italians see beauty in what... what used to be.
295	00:19:26	00:19:30	It's been 50 years since I've seen lights on the Rouge.
296	00:19:33	00:19:35	She walks in beauty, like the night.
297	00:19:38	00:19:41	My husband, Jules Rosenthal, built this.
298	00:19:41	00:19:45	Do you know it was the first casino where blacks weren't turned away at the door?
299	00:19:45	00:19:47	Your husband was a brave man.
300	00:19:47	00:19:49	Oh, he liked making money.
301	00:19:49	00:19:52	He gave it the best of everything.
302	00:19:52	00:19:55	The decor, the food, the music.
303	00:19:57	00:19:59	It was exciting.
304	00:19:59	00:20:00	Magical, really.
305	00:20:00	00:20:03	As long as it lasted.
306	00:20:03	00:20:05	But it died with him.
307	00:20:05	00:20:08	I haven't been inside since...
308	00:20:08	00:20:11	since he was murdered there.
309	00:20:11	00:20:14	Why didn't you sell the property?
310	00:20:14	00:20:18	There's no such thing as sentiment in Las Vegas.
311	00:20:18	00:20:22	They would have torn it down, and I... I couldn't, I couldn't bear that.
312	00:20:23	00:20:24	Would you like to go in now?
313	00:20:24	00:20:27	Mm-mm.
314	00:20:27	00:20:30	You can only wake up once from a dream.
315	00:20:56	00:21:01	Wow, you know I have a glitter fetish, don't you?
316	00:21:07	00:21:11	Lots of recent activity over here.
317	00:21:19	00:21:20	Jasmine.
318	00:21:22	00:21:24	Wasn't Layla's grandmother's name Jasmine?
319	00:21:24	00:21:26	I think so, yeah.
320	00:21:29	00:21:34	I think that Layla was trying to connect with her roots.
321	00:21:56	00:21:59	I think I got a bullet in the floor.
322	00:21:59	00:22:03	Impact blew the dust back, so it must be recent.
323	00:22:03	00:22:07	Got something else that wasn't here 50 years ago.
324	00:22:07	00:22:08	Cell phone.
325	00:22:10	00:22:12	It's Layla's.
326	00:22:12	00:22:15	That explains why we didn't find one on her or in her room.
327	00:22:15	00:22:19	Last function was video camera.
328	00:22:19	00:22:20	Hey, Greg.
329	00:22:20	00:22:21	Check this out.
330	00:22:21	00:22:26	Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Layla Wells will now be singing for you.
331	00:22:30	00:22:33	That costume's in the dressing room.
332	00:22:35	00:22:38	Looks like Kip's working the flashlight and the camera.
333	00:22:40	00:22:42	Surprised by the sax man?
334	00:22:47	00:22:55	So he kills her, wraps her up, pulls her body out of here on a cart, comes back, puts the cart back.
335	00:22:55	00:22:57	Puts the costume back.
336	00:22:57	00:23:00	Put everything back the way it was 50 years ago.
337	00:23:28	00:23:29	Sir...
338	00:23:31	00:23:33	You're in custody at Desert Palm Hospital.
339	00:23:33	00:23:37	You're being treated for dehydration and malnutrition.
340	00:23:37	00:23:40	Could you tell us your name, please?
341	00:23:42	00:23:43	Don't matter.
342	00:23:46	00:23:49	How long have you lived at the ChÃ¢teau Rouge?
343	00:23:57	00:23:59	Everybody wants a piece of you.
344	00:23:59	00:24:01	Drew and, and...
345	00:24:01	00:24:04	managers and fans.
346	00:24:04	00:24:05	But...
347	00:24:06	00:24:09	but Layla and me, we just...
348	00:24:09	00:24:11	we just gave to each other.
349	00:24:11	00:24:14	She, uh, (sniffles)
350	00:24:14	00:24:15	I looked out for her.
351	00:24:15	00:24:17	I cared about her.
352	00:24:17	00:24:21	I, I tried to make her feel... safe.
353	00:24:24	00:24:26	Nobody else loved her.
354	00:24:26	00:24:28	Not like me.
355	00:24:28	00:24:30	Nobody.
356	00:24:30	00:24:33	I, uh...
357	00:24:33	00:24:35	I found out online about where her grandma danced.
358	00:24:35	00:24:38	I thought it'd be a cool surprise to take her.
359	00:24:38	00:24:42	Didn't you read that part where it says, Don't go in after dark?
360	00:24:42	00:24:45	I just wanted to get a picture of her in front of the place and get back in the cab, but she...
361	00:24:45	00:24:48	she was, like, insane to get in there.
362	00:24:48	00:24:50	She pulled apart a fence.
363	00:24:50	00:24:52	She found some door that wasn't locked.
364	00:25:04	00:25:09	Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Layla Wells will now sing for you.
365	00:25:09	00:25:12	She was so beautiful.
366	00:25:12	00:25:16	We were making sweet music.
367	00:25:18	00:25:20	Sweet music.
368	00:25:23	00:25:25	He was jealous.
369	00:25:25	00:25:27	Came at me.
370	00:25:27	00:25:28	(screams) Shoved her.
371	00:25:35	00:25:38	So you ran away not knowing if Layla was dead or alive?
372	00:25:38	00:25:41	I looked for her for hours.
373	00:25:41	00:25:47	All around that place, and up and down every street in that neighborhood for blocks, but...
374	00:25:47	00:25:49	she wasn't anywhere.
375	00:25:51	00:25:53	Guess she was still inside.
376	00:25:53	00:25:54	With him.
377	00:25:58	00:26:00	A young girl is dead.
378	00:26:01	00:26:03	I did it.
379	00:26:06	00:26:08	You got me.
380	00:26:45	00:26:53	Inspired by Harlem's famed Cotton Club, New York restaurateur Jules Rosenthal created Le ChÃ¢teau Rouge.
381	00:26:53	00:26:57	The casino flourished until tragedy struck.
382	00:26:57	00:26:59	Former Sheriff Claude Montgomery recalls what happened.
383	00:26:59	00:27:07	Mrs. Rosenthal said she thought she heard a ruckus in the musicians' dressing room.
384	00:27:07	00:27:10	She went in there, found her husband shot.
385	00:27:10	00:27:12	There were rumors it was a Mob hit.
386	00:27:13	00:27:15	That's a good story, but no.
387	00:27:15	00:27:17	He was killed by one of his employees.
388	00:27:17	00:27:23	A musician-- a guy named Melchior Wilson, a drug addict.
389	00:27:23	00:27:24	Took the money and ran.
390	00:27:24	00:27:28	Found his prints all over the wallet.
391	00:27:28	00:27:30	Confessed to the whole thing.
392	00:27:36	00:27:42	You actually found a file this old that rodents hadn't nested in, huh?
393	00:27:42	00:27:44	Yeah.
394	00:27:44	00:27:47	The guy they arrested evidently died in prison.
395	00:27:50	00:27:52	Melchior Wilson.
396	00:27:52	00:27:55	Tenor saxophone player.
397	00:27:55	00:27:59	Yeah, the old guy we caught had a .32 long Colt.
398	00:27:59	00:28:00	Nick ran it through IBIS.
399	00:28:00	00:28:03	Matched it to the bullet from the Rosenthal homicide.
400	00:28:03	00:28:10	Maybe Melchior Wilson ditched the gun at the Rouge, and our squatter discovered it 50 years later.
401	00:28:13	00:28:15	You know what we need? Hm?
402	00:28:15	00:28:19	Exemplar wallets made from reptile skin.
403	00:28:19	00:28:22	Somewhere a swamp is in mourning.
404	00:28:22	00:28:24	Lizard, snake...
405	00:28:24	00:28:26	Alligator.
406	00:28:27	00:28:34	In the 1958 case, Sheriff Montgomery lifted a print from an alligator wallet.
407	00:28:35	00:28:39	He matched it to a print from a suspect named Melchior Wilson.
408	00:28:41	00:28:43	That's the lift card from his file.
409	00:28:47	00:28:49	That's a nice, clean print.
410	00:28:49	00:28:51	No serious flaws.
411	00:28:54	00:28:56	Compare it to this one.
412	00:28:58	00:29:03	Well, the one you just lifted has voids from the alligator skin.
413	00:29:03	00:29:04	The old one doesn't.
414	00:29:04	00:29:07	That print was never on that wallet.
415	00:29:08	00:29:11	Melchior Wilson was a musician at the ChÃ¢teau Rouge.
416	00:29:11	00:29:15	His prints could have been lifted from anywhere in that room.
417	00:29:15	00:29:17	I think he was framed.
418	00:29:34	00:29:36	Hey, Grissom.
419	00:29:40	00:29:43	Where on earth have you been, stranger?
420	00:29:43	00:29:45	Hey, Nicole.
421	00:29:45	00:29:47	Hey, look who's here.
422	00:29:47	00:29:49	Hello, fellas.
423	00:29:49	00:29:50	Well, I'll be damned.
424	00:29:50	00:29:52	You're two years late.
425	00:29:52	00:29:53	George, deal him in. Feeling lucky?
426	00:29:53	00:29:55	No, I can't, Sheriff, I'm working.
427	00:29:55	00:29:56	What are you doing here?
428	00:29:56	00:29:58	I was hoping to talk to you actually.
429	00:30:00	00:30:01	About the ChÃ¢teau Rouge.
430	00:30:06	00:30:07	One hand, you win, I'll talk.
431	00:30:07	00:30:10	$500 will buy you in.
432	00:30:10	00:30:12	Big blind's $20.
433	00:30:12	00:30:14	Chateau Rouge...
434	00:30:14	00:30:19	When I was playing the lounge at the Dunes, I used to make that my last stop on the way home.
435	00:30:20	00:30:22	Lived on the west side, then, huh?
436	00:30:22	00:30:23	Yeah, Sheriff, you know.
437	00:30:23	00:30:24	We had to.
438	00:30:24	00:30:27	Vegas was known as Mississippi of the West.
439	00:30:27	00:30:34	Pearl Bailey, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis, Lena Horne, the Mills Brothers-- I booked them all into the big rooms on the Strip.
440	00:30:34	00:30:36	But they could not stay in the hotels.
441	00:30:36	00:30:38	They couldn't even gamble in the casinos.
442	00:30:38	00:30:42	As a matter of fact, they came in and out through the kitchen.
443	00:30:42	00:30:44	You remember beautiful Dorothy Dandridge?
444	00:30:44	00:30:49	There was something about her going in for a swim at one of the hotels.
445	00:30:49	00:30:51	They drained the whole damn pool.
446	00:30:51	00:30:53	Sheriff, it's up to you.
447	00:30:53	00:30:55	Twenty.
448	00:30:57	00:30:58	I'm gone.
449	00:30:58	00:31:00	Grissom?
450	00:31:00	00:31:03	The women at the ChÃ¢teau Rouge-- mm-mm-mm!
451	00:31:03	00:31:07	They had such tiny waists.
452	00:31:07	00:31:09	And cakes, too.
453	00:31:09	00:31:12	Ponytails was the big thing then.
454	00:31:12	00:31:14	They all had cute little ponytails.
455	00:31:15	00:31:17	Lord have mercy.
456	00:31:19	00:31:20	And the flop.
457	00:31:20	00:31:22	Check. No $20?
458	00:31:25	00:31:27	Raise to $50.
459	00:31:27	00:31:37	Matter of fact, when they whacked Jules Rosenthal, they shuttered that place so fast, they paid the stagehands in sugar bags full of quarters and nickels, and they were gone.
460	00:31:37	00:31:42	Melchior Wilson's arrest must have set a speed record for closing a homicide, huh, Sheriff?
461	00:31:42	00:31:44	Those were the days.
462	00:31:49	00:31:51	Turns a five.
463	00:31:52	00:31:54	I fold.
464	00:31:54	00:31:56	Sheriff?
465	00:31:56	00:31:58	Twenty.
466	00:31:58	00:32:00	You in or out?
467	00:32:05	00:32:07	Check.
468	00:32:08	00:32:10	Twenty.
469	00:32:10	00:32:13	You haven't raised once.
470	00:32:13	00:32:17	Either the county's still not paying you enough, or you're bluffing.
471	00:32:21	00:32:23	All in.
472	00:32:26	00:32:28	Call.
473	00:32:30	00:32:32	Now is when you show your hand, Sheriff.
474	00:32:32	00:32:36	Dead man's hand-- aces and eights.
475	00:32:36	00:32:38	Straight.
476	00:32:40	00:32:42	Hell...
477	00:32:42	00:32:45	I used to be able to bluff better.
478	00:32:45	00:32:48	Wilson signed a confession.
479	00:32:48	00:32:50	Yeah.
480	00:32:50	00:32:58	But they say some of you guys used to drive suspects out into the dessert, show them a hole in the ground, give them a choice to sign a confession or get in the hole.
481	00:32:58	00:33:00	We got a good, clean print.
482	00:33:00	00:33:05	The file says that you lifted the print from Rosenthal's alligator wallet.
483	00:33:05	00:33:07	Now I examined it.
484	00:33:07	00:33:10	Alligator skin would've left voids.
485	00:33:10	00:33:15	You know, in the old days, the criminals were afraid of us, now it's the other way around.
486	00:33:17	00:33:20	Does he look familiar to you?
487	00:33:22	00:33:25	He's been squatting at the ChÃ¢teau Rouge.
488	00:33:25	00:33:30	Now, I ran his prints against the unidentifieds that you lifted from the scene in '58.
489	00:33:30	00:33:32	This man was all over the place.
490	00:33:35	00:33:42	With all the crime that's going on in Vegas these days, you got time to poke around in my old cases.
491	00:33:44	00:33:46	Good to see you, son.
492	00:33:46	00:33:48	Thanks for the drink.
493	00:34:23	00:34:25	And we know Drew Rich didn't do it.
494	00:34:25	00:34:27	His alibi checks out.
495	00:34:27	00:34:31	Apparently, he's a big spender on the hookers.
496	00:34:31	00:34:33	So, how did Layla get punched in the gut?
497	00:34:33	00:34:39	She came out of the dressing room, sang for Kip on stage.
498	00:34:39	00:34:42	Then the old man came out from somewhere behind you.
499	00:34:42	00:34:43	To the left.
500	00:34:43	00:34:47	Layla screamed and ran this direction.
501	00:34:47	00:34:52	Then Kip dropped the flashlight, so she probably couldn't see where she was going.
502	00:35:01	00:35:03	Matches her costume.
503	00:35:05	00:35:07	I think she ran into this.
504	00:35:12	00:35:14	It does match her bruises.
505	00:35:22	00:35:24	Her death was an accident?
506	00:35:24	00:35:27	Why did the old man confess to it?
507	00:35:27	00:35:30	Why won't he tell us who he is?
508	00:35:34	00:35:35	What you doing?
509	00:35:35	00:35:39	These are from the souvenir program you collected.
510	00:35:39	00:35:41	We still don't have an I.D. on the suspect.
511	00:35:41	00:35:47	But I'm thinking, given his age, and the fact that he plays the sax-- maybe he worked there back in the day.
512	00:35:47	00:35:49	Melchior Wilson died in prison.
513	00:35:49	00:35:54	Which leaves these two-- Harry Bastille and Stanley Brown.
514	00:35:54	00:35:57	We don't have anything on either of these guys after '58.
515	00:35:57	00:36:02	No recordings, no credits, no death records.
516	00:36:17	00:36:20	Well, hello, Harry.
517	00:36:20	00:36:23	Mr. Bastille, we know you didn't kill the girl.
518	00:36:23	00:36:26	But why did you move the body?
519	00:36:26	00:36:28	Why didn't you call for help?
520	00:36:28	00:36:33	Didn't want anybody coming in my space.
521	00:36:33	00:36:38	Wanted to spend my time in the last place I was ever happy.
522	00:36:38	00:36:42	We were all like a family back there.
523	00:36:42	00:36:44	A beautiful moment in time.
524	00:36:44	00:36:47	Right this way, please.
525	00:36:53	00:36:56	Thank you for coming, Mrs. Rosenthal.
526	00:36:56	00:36:59	Is the name Harry Bastille familiar to you?
527	00:37:01	00:37:03	Um... there was a musician...
528	00:37:03	00:37:09	Would you take a look at the man in this room, and tell us if you think it could be Harry?
529	00:37:09	00:37:11	Well, that was a very long time ago.
530	00:37:11	00:37:13	Please.
531	00:37:24	00:37:26	That's not Harry.
532	00:37:28	00:37:31	I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
533	00:37:38	00:37:42	Mrs. Rosenthal, that is Harry Bastille.
534	00:37:42	00:37:44	Well, you knew.
535	00:37:44	00:37:47	Why did you ask me to go and look at him?
536	00:37:47	00:37:51	We think he may be the man that murdered your husband.
537	00:37:52	00:37:54	He didn't shoot Jules.
538	00:37:55	00:37:58	I know, because I was there.
539	00:37:58	00:38:01	Do you know Sheriff Montgomery?
540	00:38:01	00:38:03	Very well.
541	00:38:03	00:38:07	Well, I promise you there is no evidence incriminating Harry.
542	00:38:12	00:38:17	You seem to me to be a woman who doesn't change her tastes very often.
543	00:38:20	00:38:25	I noticed last night you had a fine bottle of pink champagne in your car.
544	00:38:25	00:38:32	It's the same rare champagne that was found in the room where your husband was murdered.
545	00:38:32	00:38:37	Now... champagne usually suggests a celebration.
546	00:38:37	00:38:40	Or, maybe, in this case...
547	00:38:40	00:38:42	a romance.
548	00:38:48	00:38:50	We had nowhere to be together.
549	00:38:50	00:38:54	So we took a chance after the last show.
550	00:39:00	00:39:03	Baby, you sure we're safe?
551	00:39:03	00:39:05	Everybody's gone home.
552	00:39:07	00:39:09	We were making sweet music.
553	00:39:10	00:39:13	Sweet music.
554	00:39:14	00:39:15	He was jealous.
555	00:39:16	00:39:17	You son of a bitch!
556	00:39:17	00:39:19	Came at me... This is how you repay me?!
557	00:39:19	00:39:21	No! No! Shoved her.
558	00:39:29	00:39:33	Harry wanted to say that he did it.
559	00:39:33	00:39:38	And I... I couldn't let that happen.
560	00:39:38	00:39:48	I took the cash out of Jules' wallet and gave it to him and told him to run... and never come back.
561	00:39:48	00:39:53	And then you and Sheriff Montgomery framed Melchior Wilson.
562	00:39:53	00:39:56	No.
563	00:39:56	00:39:57	I confessed.
564	00:39:57	00:40:00	The town was very different then.
565	00:40:00	00:40:07	And the men who ran it forced the sheriff to arrest Melchior.
566	00:40:10	00:40:14	You see...
567	00:40:14	00:40:19	a white woman could get away with murder...
568	00:40:19	00:40:23	but she couldn't love a black man.
569	00:41:23	00:41:29	There's the people who come to Vegas wanting to become rich or famous, and then there's the people that are from here.
570	00:41:29	00:41:32	And we know that the odds are always in favor of the house.
571	00:41:32	00:41:35	It's what built this town.
572	00:41:35	00:41:38	You didn't come here to become famous, did you?
573	00:41:38	00:41:40	I came to play cards.
574	00:41:40	00:41:42	No, for real.
575	00:41:42	00:41:43	I did-- I came to play cards.
576	00:41:43	00:41:45	I needed the money.
577	00:41:45	00:41:52	I thought I was in love with this girl, in college, but I kept getting into debt buying cadavers and fetal pigs.
578	00:41:52	00:41:54	There was no money left for the girl.
579	00:41:54	00:41:56	Science took the pot.
580	00:41:56	00:41:59	Well, maybe it just wasn't the right girl.
581	00:42:00	00:42:03	Plus, poker allowed me to be a loner and still make money.
582	00:42:03	00:42:06	Oh. Right.
583	00:42:06	00:42:08	When was the last time you played?
584	00:42:08	00:42:10	I can't remember.
585	00:42:10	00:42:15	You know, to most people, risk is a bad thing, but in Vegas, it's a good thing.
586	00:42:16	00:42:23	See? You paid for your pigs, you got roots, friends, family...
587	00:42:23	00:42:25	Well, a work family anyway.
588	00:42:26	00:42:29	Maybe it's time to up the ante.
