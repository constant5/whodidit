0	00:00:38	00:00:39	Jesse?
1	00:00:41	00:00:43	Jesse?
2	00:00:44	00:00:46	Jesse... Jesse, can you hear me?
3	00:00:49	00:00:51	Jesse, please!
4	00:00:52	00:00:53	Jesse!!
5	00:00:53	00:00:56	Jesse Matthews, six years old.
6	00:00:56	00:00:57	Is this an old photo?
7	00:00:57	00:00:58	Yeah, it's the only one the mom had.
8	00:00:59	00:01:02	She said one minute, he's on the swing, the next minute he's gone. Abduction.
9	00:01:03	00:01:05	The search radius is over a mile-- no sign of the boy.
10	00:01:05	00:01:06	What about the father?
11	00:01:07	00:01:08	The father is, um...
12	00:01:08	00:01:11	Army sergeant, uh... Dwight Matthews.
13	00:01:11	00:01:13	Killed in Afghanistan four years ago.
14	00:01:13	00:01:16	Any other family members? Grandparents? Boyfriends?
15	00:01:16	00:01:21	No, her parents are dead and her husband's parents-- she lost communication with them since he died.
16	00:01:23	00:01:27	Mrs. Matthews... this is Gil Grissom and Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.
17	00:01:28	00:01:31	I, uh... I never bring Jesse to the park.
18	00:01:31	00:01:43	But this afternoon, the backyard just couldn't hold him, so we came here and... uh... he was on the swings; I couldn't even get him off, and then I look around and he's gone; he's just...
19	00:01:43	00:01:47	Mrs. Matthews, there's really nothing more you can do here.
20	00:01:47	00:01:50	Why don't you let us give you a ride home?
21	00:01:50	00:01:53	I'm not leaving.
22	00:01:53	00:01:55	Not without Jesse.
23	00:02:01	00:02:03	I called the team.
24	00:02:05	00:02:06	They always look so vulnerable.
25	00:02:06	00:02:08	They are.
26	00:02:43	00:02:47	It's like trying to get an i.d. on swimmers from ripples in the pool. How about you?
27	00:02:47	00:02:52	Lots of little fingers... and some big ones.
28	00:02:52	00:02:54	Helping hands?
29	00:03:21	00:03:24	So, ma'am, do you remember this boy?
30	00:03:24	00:03:26	It's not a recent photo.
31	00:03:27	00:03:29	I had my hands full.
32	00:03:30	00:03:31	I don't take my eyes off him ever.
33	00:03:31	00:03:33	Sure. I understand.
34	00:03:33	00:03:38	But there was this man near the swings-- he kept looking around like he was waiting for something.
35	00:03:38	00:03:40	What'd he look like?
36	00:03:40	00:03:42	He was a white guy, blue baseball cap...
37	00:03:42	00:03:43	That's all I remember.
38	00:03:43	00:03:45	Did he seem interested in one of the kids?
39	00:03:45	00:03:47	Yeah. A boy.
40	00:03:47	00:03:49	Could be that boy.
41	00:03:51	00:03:52	Mm... it's hard to tell. Okay...
42	00:03:52	00:03:55	Thank you. Thank you very much.
43	00:03:58	00:04:00	Mrs. Matthews...
44	00:04:00	00:04:05	I know this is difficult for you, but I have to ask you again-- do you remember seeing anyone hanging around near the swings?
45	00:04:06	00:04:10	Anyone. Maybe, maybe a man in a blue baseball cap?
46	00:04:16	00:04:17	Yes.
47	00:04:17	00:04:19	Can you describe him?
48	00:04:19	00:04:20	He was white...
49	00:04:20	00:04:21	White...
50	00:04:21	00:04:24	Uh... just under six feet, I think.
51	00:04:24	00:04:25	Six feet. Great.
52	00:04:25	00:04:26	Jeans.
53	00:04:30	00:04:32	Did he take Jesse?
54	00:04:32	00:04:34	We don't know.
55	00:04:59	00:05:04	Our K-9 officers are going to need something that Jesse's worn recently.
56	00:05:04	00:05:06	Uh... his jacket.
57	00:05:06	00:05:08	It's in the car. I'll get it for you.
58	00:05:42	00:05:44	Whoa! Whoa! What are they doing?
59	00:05:44	00:05:45	Pull the dogs back, please.
60	00:05:48	00:05:49	Can I see this jacket?
61	00:05:55	00:05:57	Has Jesse ever worn this?
62	00:05:57	00:05:58	I just bought it for him.
63	00:05:58	00:06:00	He's been growing so fast. I'm sorry, I...
64	00:06:00	00:06:02	That's okay; we'll get something from your house.
65	00:06:32	00:06:34	What do you make of this?
66	00:06:36	00:06:38	Possible struggle...
67	00:06:38	00:06:40	That could've been used as a weapon.
68	00:06:40	00:06:44	The blood drops could be castoff.
69	00:06:59	00:07:01	Maybe the poor kid had to pee while his mom was in the car.
70	00:07:11	00:07:14	Mrs. Matthews, I need you to take a look at something.
71	00:07:14	00:07:15	Do you recognize these?
72	00:07:21	00:07:22	They're...
73	00:07:37	00:07:39	Mrs. Matthews inside?
74	00:07:39	00:07:41	Yeah.
75	00:07:41	00:07:43	Every mother's worst nightmare.
76	00:07:45	00:07:47	no calls.
77	00:07:47	00:07:51	Well, I'll get a DNA exemplar for Jesse and let her get some sleep.
78	00:07:51	00:07:52	She won't sleep.
79	00:07:52	00:07:54	Okay, Greg, let's do a little legwork, what do you say?
80	00:07:54	00:07:59	You take this side of the street, I'll take the other-- find out if anybody's seen anything suspicious.
81	00:08:26	00:08:28	Mrs. Matthews?
82	00:08:35	00:08:36	Mrs. Matthews?
83	00:08:38	00:08:41	I'm Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
84	00:08:41	00:08:43	Sorry about the mess.
85	00:08:43	00:08:44	It's okay.
86	00:08:44	00:08:47	Jesse was so full of energy this morning.
87	00:08:47	00:08:50	He didn't give me time to clean up.
88	00:08:50	00:08:52	I understand.
89	00:08:52	00:08:54	This photo...
90	00:08:54	00:08:57	Is it recent?
91	00:08:57	00:09:00	Uh, yeah, that's, uh, that's from last month.
92	00:09:00	00:09:03	If it's all right with you, I'd like to borrow it.
93	00:09:03	00:09:06	I'll get it to Nevada Child Search, and they can get it out to the media.
94	00:09:06	00:09:07	Sure.
95	00:09:07	00:09:08	Thank you.
96	00:09:12	00:09:14	Jesse's home-schooled.
97	00:09:15	00:09:18	We do art together... music...
98	00:09:18	00:09:21	Everything.
99	00:09:24	00:09:26	Do you have children?
100	00:09:26	00:09:30	I have a daughter. Thirteen.
101	00:09:30	00:09:32	Thirty-six and a half inches.
102	00:09:32	00:09:36	We'll add it to the physical description.
103	00:09:36	00:09:40	And, Mrs. Matthews, our K-9 Unit will need something with Jesse's scent.
104	00:09:41	00:09:41	Oh, right, right.
105	00:09:42	00:09:44	Um... maybe... maybe his stuffed dinosaur?
106	00:09:44	00:09:46	He holds it while he's sleeping.
107	00:09:46	00:09:48	That'll work.
108	00:09:51	00:09:54	a toothbrush, hairbrush, pillowcase...
109	00:09:54	00:09:55	Why do you need that?
110	00:09:55	00:10:00	Well, if we locate anything that could lead us to him, we want to make sure we've got the right boy.
111	00:10:00	00:10:03	Well, I'll get those things for you.
112	00:10:16	00:10:18	Hi.
113	00:10:18	00:10:20	Captain Brass asked me to drive the lady's car home.
114	00:10:20	00:10:21	Oh... okay.
115	00:10:21	00:10:22	Yeah, I'll let her know.
116	00:10:22	00:10:24	Thanks. Mm-hmm.
117	00:10:48	00:10:51	Since her husband died, Kids' toys always laying around.
118	00:10:51	00:10:58	I'm always tossing balls over my fence back into her yard They keep to themselves, which is fine by me.
119	00:10:58	00:11:02	Sir, have you seen any suspicious cars in the neighborhood, or strangers?
120	00:11:02	00:11:06	I work all day and I don't spend my nights looking at the neighbors, okay?
121	00:11:06	00:11:08	Well, what about the weekends?
122	00:11:10	00:11:12	Aggressive little pooch.
123	00:11:12	00:11:14	Oh, she's my sweetie.
124	00:11:14	00:11:15	Who's my good girl?
125	00:11:16	00:11:17	Queenie's my good girl.
126	00:11:17	00:11:20	Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
127	00:11:21	00:11:22	Interesting how things work out.
128	00:11:22	00:11:24	What do you mean?
129	00:11:24	00:11:26	Her kid getting killed.
130	00:11:26	00:11:27	This is Queenie.
131	00:11:27	00:11:31	My last dog, Princess...
132	00:11:31	00:11:34	Princess died, and she did it.
133	00:11:34	00:11:36	Karen Matthews?
134	00:11:36	00:11:38	Four years ago.
135	00:11:38	00:11:41	I found Princess hanging off the back fence.
136	00:11:41	00:11:45	Supposed to look like it was an accident, like she got caught on collar and choked.
137	00:11:45	00:11:47	Did you see her do that?
138	00:11:47	00:11:51	No, but I knew.
139	00:11:51	00:11:54	See, Princess used to bark through the fence at her kid.
140	00:11:54	00:11:56	She just wanted to play.
141	00:11:56	00:11:59	If you ask me, you know what?
142	00:11:59	00:12:03	the kid liked it, but Karen she just went off the deep end.
143	00:12:03	00:12:07	Mr. McCracken, who told you her son was killed?
144	00:12:33	00:12:34	Who takes care of the hamsters?
145	00:12:34	00:12:37	Jesse. When he remembers.
146	00:12:37	00:12:41	which is about as often as he remembers to brush his teeth.
147	00:12:44	00:12:47	Mrs. Matthews, has Jesse ever run away from home?
148	00:12:47	00:12:49	He'd never do that.
149	00:12:50	00:12:53	Was he upset about anything?
150	00:12:53	00:12:56	No. No. No.
151	00:12:56	00:12:57	You're going to find him.
152	00:12:58	00:13:01	If something happened, I'd know.
153	00:13:04	00:13:06	I'd know here.
154	00:13:06	00:13:08	Of course. I'd feel the same.
155	00:13:10	00:13:19	Mrs. Matthews, when the officer brought your car back, I noticed that there were gifts in the garage that were from your husband's parents.
156	00:13:19	00:13:24	The, um... the colonel and his wife.
157	00:13:24	00:13:26	We're, uh, we're not in touch anymore.
158	00:13:26	00:13:31	Ever since Dwight was...
159	00:13:31	00:13:35	Ever since Dwight died, my father-in-law thinks he should be raising Jesse, not me.
160	00:13:35	00:13:38	He runs that house like an Army barracks.
161	00:13:38	00:13:41	Do you know what that does to a boy?
162	00:13:41	00:13:46	Well, I saw what it did to Dwight, and I will not let him do that to Jesse.
163	00:13:46	00:13:49	I'm still going to need some contact information.
164	00:13:52	00:13:53	They took him.
165	00:14:44	00:14:50	We haven't seen Karen or Jesse since, um... uh...
166	00:14:51	00:14:53	since...
167	00:14:53	00:14:57	We haven't seen them in four years, since the day we buried our son.
168	00:15:01	00:15:04	Here. Here's your toy soldier.
169	00:15:10	00:15:11	Warren, not today.
170	00:15:11	00:15:12	He's my grandson.
171	00:15:12	00:15:14	It-it's, it's a toy.
172	00:15:14	00:15:17	I will raise my own son-- not you.
173	00:15:21	00:15:29	Jesse comes from a, from a long line of military men going all the way back to Bull Run.
174	00:15:29	00:15:30	Were you in the service?
175	00:15:30	00:15:33	Yes, sir. Marine Corps.
176	00:15:33	00:15:34	I bet your dad was, too, right?
177	00:15:34	00:15:36	You know, we're here to talk about your family, not mine.
178	00:15:37	00:15:43	If we hadn't seen Jesse's picture last night on TV, we wouldn't know what he looked like now.
179	00:15:44	00:15:45	She blames me.
180	00:15:45	00:15:49	I do not. Don't tell me what I know and don't know, all right?
181	00:15:49	00:15:50	Can I please just go to the bathroom?
182	00:15:50	00:15:52	Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
183	00:15:52	00:15:53	Where is it?
184	00:15:53	00:15:58	It's. uh... down the hall to the right, through the door.
185	00:15:58	00:15:59	Excuse me.
186	00:16:03	00:16:08	This is just between you and me.
187	00:16:08	00:16:09	I saw Karen last week.
188	00:16:13	00:16:16	Oh, hi, Karen, uh, could I see Jesse please? No.
189	00:16:17	00:16:19	Karen, he's my only grandson.
190	00:16:19	00:16:21	You can't have him, okay?
191	00:16:21	00:16:22	I don't want to keep him, Karen.
192	00:16:22	00:16:23	I just want to give him these. Please.
193	00:16:23	00:16:24	Just leave us alone.
194	00:16:25	00:16:26	Jesse! It's Grandpa. Jesse! No, please.
195	00:16:28	00:16:30	Colonel?
196	00:16:34	00:16:36	Where's my wife?
197	00:16:36	00:16:39	She's in the ladies' room. It's okay.
198	00:16:39	00:16:44	Do you get these uh... these spells often?
199	00:16:44	00:16:46	There's some memory loss?
200	00:16:50	00:16:51	It's early Alzheimer's.
201	00:16:51	00:16:54	That's a tough one.
202	00:16:54	00:16:58	All I wanted was to see my grandson.
203	00:17:01	00:17:03	Find him for me.
204	00:17:03	00:17:05	We'll do our best, sir.
205	00:17:05	00:17:07	We'll do our very best.
206	00:17:09	00:17:11	Any luck with those prints from the swing?
207	00:17:11	00:17:15	Nothing on AFIS, but Brass did put out a bulletin for the guy in the blue baseball cap.
208	00:17:15	00:17:18	I wouldn't get our hopes up-- it's a vague description.
209	00:17:18	00:17:19	What about the K-9 search?
210	00:17:19	00:17:20	Nothing.
211	00:17:22	00:17:23	What do you got for me?
212	00:17:23	00:17:27	Well, I ran the exemplar toothbrush against a blood sample from the men's room.
213	00:17:28	00:17:29	It's not a match.
214	00:17:29	00:17:30	What about the underpants?
215	00:17:30	00:17:34	Couldn't get enough epithelials for DNA 'cause the kid probably hadn't been wearing them for very long.
216	00:17:34	00:17:36	I wonder why.
217	00:17:36	00:17:39	Well, I did confirm a positive result for urea in the underpants.
218	00:17:40	00:17:44	and the quantity and distribution suggests that the kid wet himself.
219	00:17:44	00:17:47	Ditched his wet tighty-whiteys and went back out to play.
220	00:17:50	00:17:52	I got a hit on your blood. Conner Daly.
221	00:17:52	00:17:54	Convicted of NRS 201.450.
222	00:17:54	00:17:55	Out on parole.
223	00:17:55	00:17:57	What's a 450?
224	00:17:57	00:17:59	That'd be Sex With Dead Body.
225	00:18:04	00:18:08	Mr. Daly, where were you yesterday afternoon?
226	00:18:08	00:18:11	Playing nickel slots downtown.
227	00:18:11	00:18:16	I, uh.... I'm not trying to win the big jackpot or anything just passing time.
228	00:18:17	00:18:21	It relaxes me.
229	00:18:21	00:18:24	Where did you go next?
230	00:18:24	00:18:25	Walked in the park.
231	00:18:26	00:18:27	Fresh air.
232	00:18:27	00:18:30	I'm allergic to smoke.
233	00:18:30	00:18:31	Which park?
234	00:18:31	00:18:33	One near my apartment.
235	00:18:33	00:18:37	Would that be Mesa Valley Park?
236	00:18:37	00:18:38	Yeah.
237	00:18:38	00:18:44	Then I sat down on a park bench and read a copy of the RJ that I picked out of the trash.
238	00:18:44	00:18:45	What's this about?
239	00:18:45	00:18:47	Did you go to the men's room at any time?
240	00:18:47	00:18:49	Only when nature called.
241	00:18:49	00:18:51	What did you do there?
242	00:18:52	00:18:54	I amused myself.
243	00:18:54	00:18:56	What did you do next?
244	00:18:56	00:18:58	We found your blood on the floor.
245	00:18:58	00:19:02	I get nosebleeds.
246	00:19:02	00:19:04	Too much cocaine back in the day.
247	00:19:04	00:19:07	I'm sure we'll find that on your medical records.
248	00:19:13	00:19:16	My whole damn life is on record.
249	00:19:17	00:19:19	So, why don't you look at the freakin' records, huh?
250	00:19:19	00:19:21	You have anger issues, Mr. Daly?
251	00:19:23	00:19:25	Yeah.
252	00:19:25	00:19:29	Would you take a seat for me, please.
253	00:19:37	00:19:40	What's that cut on your hand from?
254	00:19:40	00:19:41	Pick the wrong partner?
255	00:19:41	00:19:43	No.
256	00:19:51	00:19:54	Look, I'll send the county a buck 50.
257	00:19:54	00:19:56	They can buy a new one.
258	00:20:00	00:20:02	You recognize this boy?
259	00:20:05	00:20:09	Looks like a kid that this guy brought into the bathroom but I didn't stay to watch.
260	00:20:09	00:20:11	Did you get a look at the guy?
261	00:20:13	00:20:15	51s fan.
262	00:20:16	00:20:18	His cap.
263	00:20:18	00:20:22	Las Vegas police may have a break in the case of a missing boy.
264	00:20:22	00:20:32	An eyewitness has come forward with a more complete description of the suspect Authorities are now seeking this man in connection with the disappearance yesterday of six-year-old Jesse Matthews.
265	00:20:32	00:20:41	Initial reports from the scene only mention a man in a blue cap, but the police artist had a lot more to work with after the eyewitness came forward.
266	00:20:41	00:20:45	Uh, uh... I'm ju... I'm just trying to stay positive.
267	00:20:45	00:20:49	and, um, you know, I know that Jesse'll be safe at home again soon. So.
268	00:20:51	00:20:52	I know he'll be safe.
269	00:20:52	00:20:56	The boy's mother, Karen, is holding out hope that she'll see her son again.
270	00:20:56	00:20:58	She's seen tragedy enough.
271	00:20:58	00:21:03	Four years ago, she lost her husband in combat in Afghanistan.
272	00:21:15	00:21:16	Sorry. Declined again.
273	00:21:16	00:21:18	You have another card?
274	00:21:18	00:21:19	Aw, come on.
275	00:21:19	00:21:20	That's the fourth time.
276	00:21:20	00:21:22	Maybe we got identity theft-ed or something.
277	00:21:22	00:21:24	Hey, hey, leave that candy alone.
278	00:21:24	00:21:25	It could be the card-reader.
279	00:21:25	00:21:26	My manager be right back.
280	00:21:26	00:21:29	If you guys want to get some coffee it's on the house.
281	00:21:29	00:21:30	Las Vegas Police.
282	00:21:30	00:21:32	You're under arrest. What?
283	00:21:32	00:21:33	That's the kid from the news, right?
284	00:21:33	00:21:34	Yeah. You did good.
285	00:21:34	00:21:35	Yeah, what the hell is going on here?
286	00:21:35	00:21:37	Hey, let go of me. What are you arresting us for? Huh?
287	00:21:37	00:21:39	What's going on? What are you arresting us for?!
288	00:21:39	00:21:40	Get away from him.
289	00:21:40	00:21:41	Get away from him!
290	00:21:41	00:21:42	It's all right, son.
291	00:21:42	00:21:43	You're safe now..
292	00:21:45	00:21:47	God, where is he?
293	00:21:47	00:21:49	He's in with a social worker. He's okay.
294	00:21:49	00:21:50	Jesse!
295	00:21:51	00:21:52	Oh, Jesse, thank God.
296	00:21:52	00:21:55	Thank God you're okay.
297	00:21:55	00:21:56	No, no, no, it's okay.
298	00:21:56	00:21:58	Mommy is here. You're safe now.
299	00:21:58	00:21:58	Mommy!
300	00:21:58	00:22:00	Mommy! Mommy! Adam! Adam!
301	00:22:00	00:22:02	No, your mommy's here, honey.
302	00:22:02	00:22:04	Get away from my kid!
303	00:22:04	00:22:05	What did they say to you?
304	00:22:05	00:22:06	What did they make you say, sweetheart?
305	00:22:06	00:22:08	Look at me. Don't say nothing to nobody.
306	00:22:08	00:22:10	You hear me, little man, huh?
307	00:22:10	00:22:12	Don't look at those people.
308	00:22:12	00:22:13	Just look at me. Just look right here.
309	00:22:13	00:22:15	Jim?
310	00:22:15	00:22:16	What the hell's going on?
311	00:22:16	00:22:17	That's Victor and Valerie Esposito.
312	00:22:17	00:22:20	Transplants from Jersey.
313	00:22:20	00:22:21	Check this out.
314	00:22:22	00:22:26	It was with Mrs. Esposito's personal belongings at booking.
315	00:22:26	00:22:31	He's got the same scar over his eye as in Karen's photo.
316	00:22:31	00:22:33	So this kid has two moms?
317	00:22:33	00:22:35	King Solomon threatened to cut the baby in half.
318	00:22:35	00:22:36	What are you going to do?
319	00:22:36	00:22:38	King Solomon didn't have a DNA lab.
320	00:22:42	00:22:49	Hey, is it all right if he goes with CSI Brown for a little while?
321	00:22:49	00:22:50	It won't be long.
322	00:22:52	00:22:54	Okay.
323	00:22:54	00:22:55	My name's Warrick.
324	00:22:55	00:22:56	You want to go for a walk?
325	00:22:59	00:23:00	It's okay, sweetheart.
326	00:23:00	00:23:01	He's a friend.
327	00:23:03	00:23:05	Come on, we'll have some fun.
328	00:23:05	00:23:06	Oh, wait.
329	00:23:06	00:23:08	He gets cold.
330	00:23:11	00:23:13	Thank you.
331	00:23:27	00:23:30	Wow, everybody's so busy in there, huh?
332	00:23:30	00:23:33	I hear you like dinosaurs.
333	00:23:33	00:23:36	Which one's your favorite?
334	00:23:38	00:23:41	You know what mine is? T-Rex.
335	00:23:41	00:23:45	'Cause he's got teeth like this big.
336	00:23:45	00:23:49	I bet you wouldn't want him for a pet, would you?
337	00:23:51	00:23:53	You want to see something cool?
338	00:23:53	00:23:55	Come over here.
339	00:24:01	00:24:04	This is my special science kit.
340	00:24:04	00:24:07	Got all kinds of stuff in here.
341	00:24:07	00:24:09	Let me see... I got rubber gloves.
342	00:24:11	00:24:13	Yeah...
343	00:24:13	00:24:14	Put that on.
344	00:24:14	00:24:16	What else I got in here?
345	00:24:16	00:24:18	I got pens that turn into flashlights.
346	00:24:21	00:24:24	You want to see something invisible?
347	00:24:24	00:24:26	Go like this.
348	00:24:31	00:24:32	See, there's nothing there, right?
349	00:24:32	00:24:40	But take my magic wand right here, and I put it in my special magic powder like this.
350	00:24:40	00:24:43	Watch this.
351	00:24:43	00:24:46	What appears is our fingerprints.
352	00:24:47	00:24:50	Now shine the flashlight on it.
353	00:24:51	00:24:53	Good job.
354	00:24:53	00:24:55	Will you be my assistant?
355	00:24:58	00:25:02	See, no two people's fingerprints are alike.
356	00:25:02	00:25:05	Just like no two people's spit is the same.
357	00:25:05	00:25:10	So if I took my spit like this...
358	00:25:12	00:25:14	Now you do it.
359	00:25:18	00:25:27	See, even if I mix them up, I have a machine to tell me which one is mine and which one is yours.
360	00:25:27	00:25:29	Now, I need you to tell me something.
361	00:25:29	00:25:36	Which one of these two pretty ladies is your mom?
362	00:25:36	00:25:38	That one.
363	00:25:42	00:25:43	Thank you.
364	00:25:43	00:25:45	Yeah, whatever.
365	00:25:45	00:25:46	Can I see Adam now?
366	00:25:46	00:25:49	Adam? Yeah.
367	00:25:49	00:25:50	My kid.
368	00:25:50	00:25:54	Well, once our lab confirms DNA, he can go home with his mother.
369	00:25:54	00:25:56	Who the hell do you think I am?
370	00:25:58	00:26:00	Mrs. Esposito...
371	00:26:02	00:26:04	did you adopt Adam?
372	00:26:04	00:26:06	Give me a break.
373	00:26:06	00:26:08	26 hours in labor. Finally had a C-section.
374	00:26:18	00:26:19	Did you have twins?
375	00:26:28	00:26:30	Can I take Jesse home now?
376	00:26:30	00:26:33	I need your help to tie up a few loose ends.
377	00:26:33	00:26:36	Of course, anything.
378	00:26:36	00:26:37	Let's start with a sample of your DNA.
379	00:26:37	00:26:41	What? We have to follow procedure for everyone's protection.
380	00:26:41	00:26:45	In fact, Jesse can't even be released without a positive match.
381	00:26:45	00:26:48	He doesn't stay up this late.
382	00:26:48	00:26:49	I'll make it a rush, I promise.
383	00:26:54	00:26:56	Open your mouth, please.
384	00:26:59	00:27:02	It's the same kid.
385	00:27:02	00:27:04	It's a doppelganger, with an identical scar.
386	00:27:04	00:27:06	He picked Mrs. Esposito.
387	00:27:06	00:27:12	I know there's cases in which the kidnappers threatened their victims, Tell them that I'm your mother or I'll kill your real mom.
388	00:27:12	00:27:14	I don't think he's lying.
389	00:27:14	00:27:16	I don't think that Mrs. Esposito's lying either.
390	00:27:16	00:27:20	Karen Matthews had a house full of photos of him.
391	00:27:20	00:27:22	Well, I'm sure the Espositos do, too.
392	00:27:25	00:27:30	There's something off about this picture.
393	00:27:30	00:27:31	It seems kind of set up, doesn't it?
394	00:27:36	00:27:38	The pixel density's not the same.
395	00:27:42	00:27:44	Where'd she get this picture of Adam?
396	00:27:44	00:27:46	How'd she get it?
397	00:27:46	00:27:47	Maybe she's a stalker.
398	00:27:47	00:27:48	No, she wouldn't have stalked us to Cape May.
399	00:27:49	00:27:49	This isn't it.
400	00:27:50	00:27:52	It's the only shore we've been to.
401	00:27:52	00:27:53	Do you recognize anything in the picture?
402	00:27:53	00:27:59	Yeah, that's the shirt his Nana gave him last summer. He only wore it that once, at our family reunion.
403	00:27:59	00:28:02	Was Karen Matthews there?
404	00:28:02	00:28:04	No way.
405	00:28:04	00:28:05	Mr. Esposito...
406	00:28:06	00:28:14	several witnesses saw a man matching your description at Mesa Valley Park when Jesse disappeared.
407	00:28:14	00:28:16	Yeah, I'm there all the time.
408	00:28:16	00:28:17	We live around the corner.
409	00:28:17	00:28:19	We just had Adam's birthday party there last month.
410	00:28:19	00:28:20	Yeah.
411	00:28:21	00:28:23	Were you there the day before yesterday?
412	00:28:23	00:28:25	Yeah, with Adam. Yeah.
413	00:28:25	00:28:27	You told me you were taking him for ice cream.
414	00:28:27	00:28:29	What were you doing in the park?
415	00:28:29	00:28:30	I had to meet a guy.
416	00:28:30	00:28:33	A guy?
417	00:28:33	00:28:34	Oh, my God.
418	00:28:34	00:28:35	You're putting money down on a game?
419	00:28:35	00:28:39	You promised you quit. I did, all right? It's for a guy at work.
420	00:28:43	00:28:44	Three-to-one, right?
421	00:28:47	00:28:49	Adam.
422	00:28:50	00:28:52	Well, you should have just took him for ice cream.
423	00:28:55	00:29:00	So Karen took a picture of herself at the beach and Photoshopped Jesse in.
424	00:29:00	00:29:01	Right.
425	00:29:01	00:29:06	So if that's really Adam Esposito, where did she get the pictures from?
426	00:29:06	00:29:08	Well, let us see.
427	00:29:09	00:29:11	Where are you going?
428	00:29:11	00:29:14	Image search.
429	00:29:14	00:29:16	Family home page.
430	00:29:16	00:29:19	My mom wants me to do one of these for our family.
431	00:29:20	00:29:24	Click on where it says Adam's Birthday Party.
432	00:29:24	00:29:26	That one.
433	00:29:26	00:29:29	Maybe Karen found the site.
434	00:29:29	00:29:31	Cut out the kid's picture.
435	00:29:31	00:29:34	That's Mesa Valley Park.
436	00:29:34	00:29:38	Karen Matthews faked those photos that she gave Catherine.
437	00:29:38	00:29:39	How?
438	00:29:39	00:29:41	Cut-and-paste.
439	00:29:42	00:29:43	The photos that she got off the Internet.
440	00:29:43	00:29:49	The Espositos told Catherine that they were at the park with their son the day Jesse Matthews disappeared.
441	00:29:49	00:29:50	Is that a coincidence?
442	00:29:50	00:29:55	No. My guess is Karen's been downloading pictures from the family Web site for a while.
443	00:29:55	00:29:57	The most recent being from Mesa Valley Park.
444	00:29:57	00:30:01	Could Karen have recognized the park from the pictures on the Web site?
445	00:30:01	00:30:04	Yeah, and she went there hoping to see him there.
446	00:30:04	00:30:05	But she reported him missing.
447	00:30:05	00:30:07	That makes no sense.
448	00:30:07	00:30:08	Hey, I got the DNA results.
449	00:30:08	00:30:10	The boy is Adam Esposito.
450	00:30:10	00:30:13	Victor and Valerie are his parents.
451	00:30:13	00:30:14	There you go, she's lying.
452	00:30:14	00:30:15	She doesn't have a son.
453	00:30:15	00:30:16	Uh, not quite.
454	00:30:16	00:30:20	She's got 13 alleles in common with the male DNA that we got from the toothbrush exemplar.
455	00:30:20	00:30:22	So she does have a son.
456	00:30:22	00:30:23	I was inside the house.
457	00:30:23	00:30:26	Believe me, a kid does live there.
458	00:30:28	00:30:30	And we're still looking for Jesse Matthews.
459	00:30:43	00:30:44	Karen Matthews.
460	00:30:47	00:30:50	Can I take Jesse home now?
461	00:30:50	00:30:51	I'm afraid not. No.
462	00:30:52	00:30:54	The DNA confirms the boy's not your child.
463	00:30:54	00:30:57	I... That's impossible.
464	00:30:57	00:31:03	Your actions regarding the Espositos constitutes stalking and possible kidnapping.
465	00:31:03	00:31:05	Please go with this officer.
466	00:31:05	00:31:07	No, no... What have you done with Jesse?
467	00:31:07	00:31:09	Ma'am...
468	00:31:09	00:31:10	Ma'am...
469	00:31:10	00:31:11	Jesse? Please, ma'am...
470	00:31:11	00:31:13	Jesse? Jesse, where are you?!
471	00:31:13	00:31:14	Ma'am, please...
472	00:31:14	00:31:15	I need to see my son!
473	00:31:15	00:31:16	Jesse!
474	00:31:16	00:31:18	Jesse, where are you?!
475	00:31:18	00:31:20	Please! Please! Jesse!
476	00:31:21	00:31:23	Jesse!
477	00:31:23	00:31:24	Jesse, where are you?!
478	00:31:24	00:31:26	Jesse David Matthews.
479	00:31:26	00:31:28	Mother Karen, father Dwight.
480	00:31:28	00:31:31	Born August 31, 1999.
481	00:31:31	00:31:34	I also checked for a death certificate.
482	00:31:34	00:31:35	Nothing on file.
483	00:31:35	00:31:37	These are all in chronological order.
484	00:31:37	00:31:42	Archie confirmed that all the photos taken along the top row were genuine.
485	00:31:42	00:31:46	Up until the photo taken at the funeral in which he was two.
486	00:31:46	00:31:49	So, the rest of these were faked using Adam Esposito?
487	00:31:49	00:31:50	Yeah.
488	00:31:50	00:31:51	You talked to the neighbors.
489	00:31:51	00:31:53	What did they say?
490	00:31:53	00:31:55	Jesse and Karen kept to themselves.
491	00:31:55	00:32:00	But he was always leaving his toys around outside. They saw his toys-- did they see him?
492	00:32:00	00:32:03	Well, when I asked, When was the last time you saw Jesse?
493	00:32:03	00:32:05	no one remembered exactly.
494	00:32:05	00:32:06	What about his grandparents?
495	00:32:06	00:32:08	They haven't seen him since the funeral.
496	00:32:08	00:32:11	Has anyone seen Jesse since he was two?
497	00:32:11	00:32:14	His teachers or a doctor, baby-sitters...?
498	00:32:14	00:32:16	Well, he was home-schooled.
499	00:32:16	00:32:19	And we're looking into a doctor and a sitter.
500	00:32:19	00:32:26	Well, I guess we can impound her car and find out if there's any evidence that he was even in there.
501	00:32:26	00:32:35	For four years she's created an elaborate fantasy-- which collided with reality at Mesa Valley Park.
502	00:32:41	00:32:43	Jesse.
503	00:32:46	00:32:47	Jesse?
504	00:32:47	00:32:49	Where are you?!
505	00:32:49	00:32:50	Jesse?!
506	00:32:50	00:32:54	I suppose she thought it was her son that was gone when she looked back at that empty swing.
507	00:32:54	00:32:58	When she couldn't find him, she called the police.
508	00:32:58	00:33:01	Jesse's been missing for four years.
509	00:33:01	00:33:04	We're chasing a ghost.
510	00:33:04	00:33:06	We went to the park.
511	00:33:06	00:33:09	I-I brought Jesse's new jacket.
512	00:33:09	00:33:15	He was on the swings and when I wasn't looking, a man in a blue cap took him.
513	00:33:15	00:33:19	Karen, tell me what happened four years ago after your husband was killed.
514	00:33:22	00:33:24	I-I... that's a...
515	00:33:24	00:33:27	I am not the one that should be here.
516	00:33:27	00:33:30	You should be talking to the man that took Jesse.
517	00:33:30	00:33:31	Did Jesse get sick?
518	00:33:31	00:33:33	Was there an accident?
519	00:33:36	00:33:38	Karen?
520	00:33:38	00:33:42	Did something happen to Jesse?
521	00:33:44	00:33:46	Is Jesse dead?
522	00:33:46	00:33:50	You saw him.
523	00:33:50	00:33:55	You were... you were there while I held him in my arms.
524	00:33:55	00:33:56	Why are you putting me through this?
525	00:33:58	00:34:00	Tell me. Why?
526	00:34:03	00:34:05	So how do we do this?
527	00:34:05	00:34:07	Old school.
528	00:34:07	00:34:09	Soil probes.
529	00:34:09	00:34:13	The probe goes deeper where the soil's been disturbed.
530	00:34:16	00:34:18	And that's where we dig?
531	00:34:18	00:34:20	On the one hand, you really want to find the body.
532	00:34:21	00:34:25	Give it respect, provide closure...
533	00:34:25	00:34:27	On the other hand...
534	00:34:27	00:34:30	Yeah.
535	00:34:37	00:34:42	She would have buried the body where he would have still been close to her.
536	00:34:42	00:34:45	You know, I'm not finding any density changes.
537	00:34:45	00:34:47	Me neither.
538	00:34:55	00:34:58	Somebody replaced this fence board right here.
539	00:34:58	00:35:02	These other ones look like they've been chewed on.
540	00:35:03	00:35:07	Guy said that Karen freaked out when his dog barked at her kid.
541	00:35:07	00:35:10	Maybe the dog chewed through the fence.
542	00:35:12	00:35:14	There's definitely a change in density there.
543	00:35:14	00:35:15	Let's start digging.
544	00:35:34	00:35:37	I found this in Karen's medicine chest.
545	00:35:37	00:35:39	Olanzapine.
546	00:35:39	00:35:41	That's a heavy-duty antipsychotic.
547	00:35:41	00:35:42	Yeah.
548	00:35:42	00:35:45	But the prescription is over four years old.
549	00:35:45	00:35:46	I'll have Brass subpoena her medical records.
550	00:35:47	00:35:54	You know, if she was being treated for psychosis, it could explain all of this, because she didn't overlook a single detail.
551	00:35:54	00:35:56	I think she even did the fingerpaintings.
552	00:35:56	00:35:58	It's hard for anyone to let go of someone they love.
553	00:35:58	00:36:00	Yeah.
554	00:36:00	00:36:04	After my dad died, my mom would still get him a present every Christmas.
555	00:36:04	00:36:06	She'd put it under the tree.
556	00:36:06	00:36:11	Christmas morning, the wrapping paper would be all crumpled up and, uh...
557	00:36:11	00:36:16	the tie or the sweater, whatever it was, would be hanging in the closet.
558	00:36:16	00:36:17	How old were you when he died?
559	00:36:18	00:36:21	Nine.
560	00:36:21	00:36:24	Little guy.
561	00:36:24	00:36:28	I'll get started in Karen's room.
562	00:36:28	00:36:30	He taught botany.
563	00:36:30	00:36:32	He, uh...
564	00:36:33	00:36:38	came home from school one hot, humid day, laid down on the couch.
565	00:36:38	00:36:39	I was watching TV.
566	00:36:41	00:36:44	My Mom brought in some cold drinks...
567	00:36:44	00:36:48	but she couldn't wake him up.
568	00:36:52	00:36:53	No one would tell me why.
569	00:37:32	00:37:35	Nick Stokes, you have a visitor in Reception.
570	00:37:36	00:37:38	Nick Stokes, you have a visitor in Reception.
571	00:37:38	00:37:40	Hey, Hodges.
572	00:37:40	00:37:42	Oh, hey, Nick.
573	00:37:42	00:37:43	Did you hear you had a visitor?
574	00:37:43	00:37:46	Yeah, and you have a tissue sample with adherent hairs.
575	00:37:46	00:37:48	Examine the hairs and get the tissue sample to DNA.
576	00:37:48	00:37:49	Priority.
577	00:37:49	00:37:51	I'll just drop everything I'm doing.
578	00:37:51	00:37:52	Priority, Nick Stokes.
579	00:37:52	00:37:53	You're coming around, Hodges.
580	00:37:57	00:37:59	Hey. I, uh, I have a visitor?
581	00:38:06	00:38:07	Kelly?
582	00:38:07	00:38:09	Hi. Hi.
583	00:38:09	00:38:12	You... you got out.
584	00:38:12	00:38:15	Couple days ago.
585	00:38:15	00:38:17	Mm...
586	00:38:17	00:38:21	Parole hearing board liked my smile.
587	00:38:27	00:38:31	You know, I thought I saw you at a crime scene the other day.
588	00:38:31	00:38:32	You did.
589	00:38:32	00:38:33	I did?
590	00:38:34	00:38:36	Just checking it out.
591	00:38:38	00:38:46	You know how, when you came to see me, what you said about when I get out, not taking it with me?
592	00:38:48	00:38:50	I've been thinking a lot about that.
593	00:38:52	00:38:55	I wanted you to know.
594	00:38:56	00:38:58	You all right?
595	00:38:58	00:39:00	Perfect.
596	00:39:35	00:39:38	That would be Queenie.
597	00:39:39	00:39:43	Even after four years, you'd expect to find some bones.
598	00:39:43	00:39:45	There's nothing.
599	00:39:52	00:39:55	Jesse liked dinosaurs.
600	00:40:08	00:40:10	Let's see what Hodges can tell us.
601	00:40:13	00:40:20	The GCMS soil analysis found Cadaverine, Putrescine and several other organic compounds.
602	00:40:20	00:40:23	Yeah. English, please?
603	00:40:23	00:40:26	It means there was a body buried in Karen's backyard.
604	00:40:26	00:40:29	Just too long ago to get any DNA.
605	00:40:29	00:40:31	But Hodges also found traces of Olanzapine.
606	00:40:31	00:40:45	Well, that's interesting, becasue a warrant came through on Karen Matthews' medical records, and after her son was born, Karen was treated for postpartum psychosis, which her doctors treated by prescribing Olanzapine.
607	00:40:45	00:40:49	Even a small amount of that stuff would be lethal to a two-year-old.
608	00:40:49	00:40:52	Karen is already mentally fragile when her husband is killed.
609	00:40:52	00:41:03	She gets into a very heated argument with the in-laws at his funeral, goes over the deep end, poisons Jesse and buries him in the backyard near the fence.
610	00:41:03	00:41:06	But then she digs him up. Why?
611	00:41:06	00:41:11	We have evidence to suggest that the neighbor's dog was digging in Karen's backyard.
612	00:41:11	00:41:15	The neighbor claims that Karen killed his dog.
613	00:41:15	00:41:23	If the dog detected decomp and dug near the grave, Karen may have moved the body to protect him.
614	00:41:23	00:41:25	So, where's Jesse's body?
615	00:41:25	00:41:30	Nick found a patch of tissue and hair in the trunk of Karen's car.
616	00:41:30	00:41:31	The DNA matches the toothbrush.
617	00:41:32	00:41:36	If Karen doesn't tell us where to look, I doubt we'll ever find the body.
618	00:41:37	00:41:40	You know, as long as I do this job, I can never understand how a mother can kill her child.
619	00:41:40	00:41:44	Euripedes tried to understand it when he wrote Medea.
620	00:41:44	00:41:50	I will slay my children without delaying long enough to hand them over to some more savage hand.
621	00:41:52	00:41:55	Medea, like Karen, was a soldier's wife.
622	00:41:56	00:42:03	His father was a soldier, his grandfather was a soldier, Karen did not want that for Jesse.
623	00:42:04	00:42:05	Well, it's still murder.
624	00:42:19	00:42:25	Mommy... Mommy!
