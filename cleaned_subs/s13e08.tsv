0	00:00:25	00:00:28	I saw a movie that started like this.
1	00:00:28	00:00:29	It did not end well.
2	00:00:29	00:00:31	Alien invasion.
3	00:00:33	00:00:35	Sheriff Anderson, Davis County.
4	00:00:35	00:00:36	Thanks for coming.
5	00:00:36	00:00:38	CSI Russell, CSI Finlay.
6	00:00:38	00:00:40	What's with all the men in black?
7	00:00:40	00:00:42	Nellis Air Force Base is down the road.
8	00:00:42	00:00:45	Apparently they just broke a very expensive toy.
9	00:00:45	00:00:47	You said something about a grave over the phone?
10	00:00:47	00:00:49	A couple hikers called in about a light show.
11	00:00:49	00:00:50	I was first on the scene.
12	00:00:50	00:00:52	I noticed some disturbed earth.
13	00:00:52	00:00:53	Want to follow me?
14	00:00:55	00:00:59	Three tours in Iraq, saw my share of mass graves.
15	00:00:59	00:01:02	They looked just like this.
16	00:01:02	00:01:04	Roughly three meters square.
17	00:01:04	00:01:07	Vegetation has barely grown back.
18	00:01:07	00:01:12	Desert varnish is on the ground side of the rock, should be on the side facing the sun.
19	00:01:12	00:01:13	This area's definitely been worked.
20	00:01:13	00:01:18	There's only one reason to dig a hole this far out in the middle of nowhere.
21	00:01:27	00:01:28	Oh, here you go.
22	00:01:33	00:01:36	Bracelet says that it's female.
23	00:01:36	00:01:37	Right.
24	00:01:37	00:01:38	Excuse me.
25	00:01:38	00:01:40	This is a Federal investigation.
26	00:01:40	00:01:42	You're in a restricted area.
27	00:01:42	00:01:47	Well, ma'am, we just found a buried body, so this is now an LVPD crime scene.
28	00:01:47	00:01:54	You're gonna have to leave the area. You know, if you keep insisting, you're gonna be in violation of NRS197-point-190.
29	00:01:54	00:01:57	Interfering with public officers in the discharge of their official duties.
30	00:01:57	00:02:01	In other words, our body trumps your X-Files convention.
31	00:02:01	00:02:02	Right.
32	00:02:05	00:02:07	Let them have their grave, keep them out of my hair.
33	00:02:07	00:02:10	That's the first time that ever worked.
34	00:02:47	00:02:49	Tissue on the extremities and skull is largely gone.
35	00:02:49	00:02:51	Remaining tissue is desiccated.
36	00:02:51	00:02:53	What's it smell like?
37	00:02:57	00:02:59	Smells like dirt.
38	00:02:59	00:03:02	It means the body's been buried for more than five years.
39	00:03:02	00:03:04	David, hold the camera steady, please.
40	00:03:04	00:03:08	Yeah. Well, the body's strangely preserved.
41	00:03:08	00:03:11	Much lighter than what we're accustomed to seeing.
42	00:03:11	00:03:13	How many bodies so far?
43	00:03:13	00:03:15	Three.
44	00:03:15	00:03:16	They all appear to be female.
45	00:03:16	00:03:19	Another desiccated fern leaf.
46	00:03:19	00:03:26	Unless these bodies were buried in the Jurassic age, And neither's this dark, rich soil.
47	00:03:26	00:03:30	Could be that the bodies were buried somewhere else, and then moved here.
48	00:03:30	00:03:33	Look at that-- military sure took off in a hell of a hurry.
49	00:03:33	00:03:36	I think you scared them, Finn.
50	00:03:44	00:03:46	Oh, Lord...
51	00:03:49	00:03:50	Got number four over here.
52	00:03:52	00:03:54	This one's...
53	00:03:54	00:03:56	different from the others.
54	00:03:56	00:03:57	Completely mummified.
55	00:03:57	00:03:59	Yeah, tissue's black.
56	00:03:59	00:04:03	Look at the facial features.
57	00:04:03	00:04:08	Distorted from bloating, and the color change is from bacterial activity.
58	00:04:08	00:04:11	Which means that she was exposed to the elements shortly after death.
59	00:04:11	00:04:15	So maybe she wasn't buried for very long before she was moved here.
60	00:04:15	00:04:19	The question is where were they all buried first?
61	00:04:19	00:04:21	Rich, dark soil, fern leaves?
62	00:04:21	00:04:23	My money's on northern climes.
63	00:04:23	00:04:24	more north than Northern Nevada.
64	00:04:35	00:04:37	David...
65	00:04:37	00:04:39	removing a necklace.
66	00:04:56	00:04:58	What you got?
67	00:04:58	00:05:03	One of a kind, vintage pendant, one carat small diamonds.
68	00:05:03	00:05:09	flowery design, 16-inch silver Coreana chain.
69	00:05:09	00:05:13	Two years and 1,200 miles-- we found her.
70	00:05:13	00:05:15	I haven't heard from Janet.
71	00:05:15	00:05:16	Something is wrong-- Janet and I talk every day.
72	00:05:16	00:05:19	She's a good girl. Dr. Warren, We're doing everything we can to find Janet.
73	00:05:19	00:05:22	Were you able to find me a recent photo of her?
74	00:05:25	00:05:28	Please find my daughter.
75	00:05:29	00:05:33	I would like to be the one to notify Janet Warren's mother.
76	00:05:33	00:05:36	As soon as we have positive I.D., we notify.
77	00:05:36	00:05:38	(watch alarm beeps) Do me a favor.
78	00:05:38	00:05:40	Greg's down at Autopsy, working the bodies.
79	00:05:40	00:05:42	Go help him out, will you?
80	00:05:42	00:05:45	I can't believe that Dr. Warren has had to wait two years for this moment.
81	00:05:45	00:05:49	The last thing you should do right now is give that woman bad information. Come on.
82	00:05:49	00:05:51	What are the chances that it is not Janet?
83	00:05:51	00:05:53	Okay, the necklace.
84	00:05:53	00:05:55	The condition of her body, the soil.
85	00:05:55	00:05:59	It all points north Yeah. to Seattle, to Tom Cooley's ranch.
86	00:05:59	00:06:02	Finn, you're getting ahead of the evidence. Again.
87	00:06:02	00:06:05	He moved her body when we turned up the heat.
88	00:06:05	00:06:08	But you know what we didn't know back then, that we know now?
89	00:06:08	00:06:10	Janet Warren was not the only victim.
90	00:06:10	00:06:12	This guy is a serial killer.
91	00:06:12	00:06:15	Who sued the crap out of you.
92	00:06:15	00:06:18	And the Seattle PD, last time around.
93	00:06:18	00:06:21	And that was with one body, we got eight now, Finn.
94	00:06:25	00:06:27	You know I'm right.
95	00:06:29	00:06:32	And for the record, I am not getting ahead of the evidence.
96	00:06:32	00:06:34	Just go help Greg, please?
97	00:06:44	00:06:45	Where's Janet Warren?
98	00:06:45	00:06:47	She's in there.
99	00:06:47	00:06:49	She should move to the head of the line.
100	00:06:49	00:06:51	That's not your call.
101	00:06:51	00:06:53	Well, can you make it yours?
102	00:06:56	00:06:59	Why are you working on her?
103	00:06:59	00:07:02	We really need to confirm Janet Warren's I.D.
104	00:07:02	00:07:05	Well, isn't that why Russell sent us both down here?
105	00:07:07	00:07:10	Have you ever had a case that kept you up at night?
106	00:07:11	00:07:13	I have been awake for two years.
107	00:07:31	00:07:36	Hey, we all know about you and your case with Janet Warren, and we're a team.
108	00:07:36	00:07:39	So if you're in, we're in.
109	00:07:39	00:07:41	Let's get this Cooley guy.
110	00:07:41	00:07:43	Thank you, Greg.
111	00:07:43	00:07:45	Okay.
112	00:07:45	00:07:51	Get her printed, and, uh, when you run DNA, can you do her first?
113	00:07:51	00:07:53	You do know that I'm not the DNA tech anymore.
114	00:07:53	00:07:55	I promise you I'll make it up to you.
115	00:08:23	00:08:25	Another finger bone for you.
116	00:08:25	00:08:31	Speaking of giving someone the finger, Finn compromised a case in Seattle by illegally obtaining DNA evidence.
117	00:08:31	00:08:34	They had hair, carpet fibers and semen from Janet Warren's car.
118	00:08:34	00:08:37	Finn went after the suspect's exemplars.
119	00:08:37	00:08:39	Why didn't she just get a warrant?
120	00:08:39	00:08:40	Guy was juiced.
121	00:08:40	00:08:43	Son of Seattle, lots of money, lots of friends.
122	00:08:43	00:08:45	And from what I heard, he had a snake for a lawyer.
123	00:08:45	00:08:50	Well, snake or not, if this guy Cooley's good for one, he's good for all eight.
124	00:08:50	00:08:52	Hey, look what I found.
125	00:08:52	00:08:53	It's a ring.
126	00:08:55	00:08:56	Looks like a man's.
127	00:08:56	00:08:58	So far, all the bodies have been female.
128	00:08:58	00:09:01	Maybe our killer left something behind?
129	00:09:05	00:09:09	So, I found a lot of interesting insects at the gravesite.
130	00:09:09	00:09:11	A lot of them are not locally abundant.
131	00:09:11	00:09:13	Yeah, I recognize the rain beetle, there.
132	00:09:13	00:09:16	Pleocoma australis-- How do you know that one?
133	00:09:16	00:09:17	Aw, I had them on a case once.
134	00:09:17	00:09:23	Found a body in a shipping container-- the rain beetle told us that she'd been buried on land first.
135	00:09:23	00:09:25	Any idea of post-mortem interval?
136	00:09:25	00:09:28	No, but I think I can give you a location.
137	00:09:28	00:09:34	This beetle, and the western thatching ant, tell me that the bodies were originally buried in the Pacific Northwest.
138	00:09:34	00:09:39	This is the pink millipede, found in the agricultural areas of Washington state.
139	00:09:39	00:09:42	Okay, well that narrows it down considerably.
140	00:09:42	00:09:45	Yeah, but this last one is the reason you should probably give me a pay raise.
141	00:09:45	00:09:48	The horntail, Xeris tarsalis, game changer.
142	00:09:48	00:09:53	narrows it down even further, puts the bodies just outside the Seattle metropolitan area.
143	00:09:55	00:09:57	Okay.
144	00:09:57	00:10:06	Well, next question is why were eight bodies already buried just outside of Seattle, dug up and moved to who-knows-where, Nevada?
145	00:10:06	00:10:10	Yeah, a place so remote, you'd have to know where it was to find it.
146	00:10:10	00:10:11	That's a good question.
147	00:10:42	00:10:43	Hey.
148	00:10:43	00:10:44	Greg.
149	00:10:44	00:10:45	Have you seen Finn? Yeah.
150	00:10:45	00:10:47	I just got off the phone with her.
151	00:10:47	00:10:48	Gave her the good news.
152	00:10:48	00:10:49	Well, now you'll give it to me.
153	00:10:49	00:10:52	Prints confirmed-- it's Janet Warren.
154	00:10:58	00:11:00	Hi, this is Finn, leave a message.
155	00:11:00	00:11:02	Oh, come on, Finn.
156	00:11:05	00:11:07	I just talked to her.
157	00:11:16	00:11:17	Are you keeping tabs on all of us?
158	00:11:17	00:11:21	Thought you needed my permission before you can... track me.
159	00:11:21	00:11:23	Exigent circumstances.
160	00:11:23	00:11:25	Hey, Mike, it's D.B. Russell.
161	00:11:25	00:11:26	How you been?
162	00:11:26	00:11:28	Got a little problem.
163	00:11:54	00:11:56	Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
164	00:12:04	00:12:07	I see they busted you back to working traffic.
165	00:12:07	00:12:09	This how you getting your dates these days, Mike?
166	00:12:09	00:12:12	You know, I'm kind of hurt you're back in Seattle, and didn't give me a call.
167	00:12:12	00:12:13	Well, I'm only here for a day.
168	00:12:13	00:12:15	Yeah, that's what D.B. figured.
169	00:12:15	00:12:18	Of course he called you.
170	00:12:18	00:12:19	Hmph.
171	00:12:19	00:12:22	I thought once I signed the divorce papers I'd never have to see you again.
172	00:12:23	00:12:25	Here, get in my car. We're going for a ride.
173	00:12:25	00:12:26	Are you arresting me?
174	00:12:26	00:12:29	Because if you actually talked to D.B., you would know why I'm here.
175	00:12:29	00:12:32	With or without cuffs, it's your call.
176	00:12:53	00:12:54	Where the hell are we?
177	00:12:54	00:12:57	Trying to help you out, here, Jules.
178	00:12:57	00:12:58	Uh, could you please not call me Jules?
179	00:12:58	00:13:00	That brings back a lot of bad memories.
180	00:13:00	00:13:03	Yeah, I've heard your version of our marriage.
181	00:13:08	00:13:13	You found Janet Warren's body, and some evidence that she was buried in Seattle.
182	00:13:13	00:13:17	Now you think that you have all that you need to get that warrant to dig up Cooley's ranch.
183	00:13:17	00:13:20	Well... you're too late.
184	00:13:20	00:13:21	That son of a bitch.
185	00:13:21	00:13:24	After he moved the bodies, he covered his tracks.
186	00:13:24	00:13:27	There's no evidence that the bodies were ever even buried here.
187	00:13:27	00:13:28	Well, you been gone for two years.
188	00:13:28	00:13:30	A lot of things have changed.
189	00:13:32	00:13:34	You can't go tearing down these people's homes.
190	00:13:34	00:13:35	All right?
191	00:13:35	00:13:38	If Janet and the other girls were buried down there, we'll never know now.
192	00:13:38	00:13:41	You know Cooley did it.
193	00:13:41	00:13:42	Jules...
194	00:13:42	00:13:43	you got a new job, a new life.
195	00:13:45	00:13:47	Don't screw it up this time.
196	00:13:49	00:13:50	Look, I'll drive you back to the airport.
197	00:13:50	00:13:53	You could drop me at my car.
198	00:13:53	00:13:57	I'm not leaving until I see Janet Warren's mother.
199	00:13:57	00:13:58	She deserves to know.
200	00:13:59	00:14:01	The press already took care of that.
201	00:14:01	00:14:02	She's already on her way to Vegas.
202	00:14:04	00:14:06	Dr. Warren, you're not going in there.
203	00:14:06	00:14:11	I am not just any grieving mother, I am a doctor, I'm a pediatrician, I've seen it all.
204	00:14:11	00:14:14	But you've never seen your own daughter dead on a slab.
205	00:14:14	00:14:16	I appreciate your concern.
206	00:14:16	00:14:17	I need to say good-bye.
207	00:14:17	00:14:21	Janet was identified based on fingerprints and DNA.
208	00:14:21	00:14:24	Her physical features, as you remember them, are gone.
209	00:14:24	00:14:26	You don't want this to be your last memory of her.
210	00:14:26	00:14:32	Are you so desensitized to death you can't even understand how I feel after two years of searching?
211	00:14:32	00:14:33	Monica...
212	00:14:34	00:14:36	Doctor, I believe you know CSI Russell.
213	00:14:36	00:14:38	I'm so sorry.
214	00:14:38	00:14:41	I'm sorry we weren't able to give you the answers you were looking for in Seattle.
215	00:14:41	00:14:44	Well, you're giving them to me now.
216	00:14:44	00:14:45	And for that, I'm grateful.
217	00:14:46	00:14:49	Now, I'd like to see my daughter.
218	00:14:49	00:14:52	Dr. Warren...
219	00:14:52	00:14:53	please take some friendly advice.
220	00:14:53	00:14:55	Remember your daughter in happier times.
221	00:15:03	00:15:05	This is the only way that I can be sure.
222	00:15:07	00:15:09	Sit with me, just for a second.
223	00:15:13	00:15:16	You remember CSI Finlay?
224	00:15:16	00:15:18	Yes.
225	00:15:18	00:15:23	Well... she found this on her body.
226	00:15:28	00:15:30	Oh...
227	00:15:37	00:15:40	You've given me Janet back.
228	00:15:43	00:15:47	Now go get that son of a bitch.
229	00:15:51	00:15:54	Uh, your cell phone is blowing up.
230	00:15:54	00:15:55	Yeah.
231	00:15:55	00:15:57	That's why I left it over there.
232	00:16:02	00:16:07	Finn is under the impression that I am her personal assistant.
233	00:16:07	00:16:10	If she's gonna get fired again, I am not gonna go down with her.
234	00:16:10	00:16:12	Nobody is getting fired.
235	00:16:12	00:16:14	Haven't you ever been passionate about a case before?
236	00:16:14	00:16:17	I am passionate about a lot of things.
237	00:16:17	00:16:19	Okay, so....
238	00:16:20	00:16:22	Take a look at this.
239	00:16:25	00:16:27	Been working on that ring I found.
240	00:16:32	00:16:35	Hardison High School, Class of 1987.
241	00:16:38	00:16:39	Hardison High.
242	00:16:39	00:16:41	15 miles outside Seattle.
243	00:16:41	00:16:42	Any photos of the class of '87?
244	00:16:45	00:16:47	Huh. She was limber.
245	00:16:47	00:16:48	Bet you can't do that.
246	00:16:51	00:16:53	Look who was Senior Class President.
247	00:16:53	00:16:54	Tom Cooley.
248	00:16:54	00:16:56	Voted Most Likely to Become a Serial Killer.
249	00:16:57	00:16:59	Time to answer your phone.
250	00:17:13	00:17:14	DNA hits on two of your Jane Does.
251	00:17:14	00:17:17	Stephanie Hollinger...
252	00:17:17	00:17:19	and Sunshine Vanletti.
253	00:17:19	00:17:21	Now, Stephanie went missing in 1999.
254	00:17:21	00:17:26	She was a 21-year-old coed from UCLA in Seattle for a Walk-and-Run.
255	00:17:26	00:17:28	Last seen at a place called Endless Lounge.
256	00:17:28	00:17:31	Trendy bar in Capitol District.
257	00:17:31	00:17:32	What about the other girl?
258	00:17:32	00:17:33	Went missing in '02.
259	00:17:33	00:17:39	23-year-old fitness instructor, worked nights as a cocktail waitress at Zobo.
260	00:17:39	00:17:40	Also in the Capitol District.
261	00:17:40	00:17:43	You know, that's the same area that Janet Warren went missing.
262	00:17:43	00:17:47	This could be Tom Cooley's hunting ground.
263	00:17:47	00:17:49	He had an office right around the corner.
264	00:17:49	00:17:51	Well, he didn't have to work that hard.
265	00:17:51	00:17:54	Tox results showed high levels of flunitrazepam.
266	00:17:54	00:17:55	Date rape drug.
267	00:17:58	00:18:01	Early 20's, athletic, blond...
268	00:18:01	00:18:05	Most of the bodies showed signs of strangulation, broken hyoids...
269	00:18:05	00:18:07	M.O. is up close and personal.
270	00:18:07	00:18:09	He likes to look in their eyes as they die.
271	00:18:09	00:18:11	Guy's a sadist.
272	00:18:11	00:18:14	Lures them in, sexually assaults them, and then strangles them.
273	00:18:14	00:18:15	Take a look at this.
274	00:18:15	00:18:22	A couple weeks after Janet disappeared, a witness came forward with this cell phone video.
275	00:18:22	00:18:23	Last time Janet was seen alive.
276	00:18:23	00:18:25	With Tom Cooley. Mm-hmm.
277	00:18:25	00:18:27	Her hand's on his thigh.
278	00:18:29	00:18:32	Giving him permission to take her home.
279	00:18:32	00:18:37	Hi, this is Captain Robinson with the, uh, Seattle Police Department.
280	00:18:37	00:18:47	Um, we're conducting a murder investigation, and we're searching for a list of students who purchased a 1987 Hardison High School class ring.
281	00:18:47	00:18:48	Yeah, I'll hold.
282	00:18:50	00:18:52	Hmm...
283	00:18:53	00:18:54	What did the poor thing wear home?
284	00:18:54	00:18:56	A smile.
285	00:19:00	00:19:01	Yeah, I'm here.
286	00:19:01	00:19:02	Oh, great.
287	00:19:02	00:19:03	Could you e-mail me that list?
288	00:19:03	00:19:04	Thanks. Excuse me, Captain.
289	00:19:04	00:19:06	Remember, our guy lost his ring.
290	00:19:08	00:19:12	Was there anybody on that list that ordered a replacement ring?
291	00:19:12	00:19:13	Yeah, a second ring.
292	00:19:13	00:19:14	There is one.
293	00:19:14	00:19:16	What's the name?
294	00:19:17	00:19:19	Eric Louie.
295	00:19:19	00:19:21	L-O-U-I-E.
296	00:19:21	00:19:24	Is there anybody else?
297	00:19:24	00:19:26	Okay. Thanks.
298	00:19:26	00:19:28	What, you think it'd be that easy?
299	00:19:28	00:19:29	She'd say Cooley, and you'd say Get in jail?
300	00:19:29	00:19:31	Let's go.
301	00:19:31	00:19:33	Any good Seattle cop knows Eric Louie.
302	00:19:35	00:19:37	Love you, Daddy!
303	00:19:37	00:19:38	Bye, guys.
304	00:19:45	00:19:47	Hey, Mikey.
305	00:19:47	00:19:49	What the hell you doing in this neck of the woods?
306	00:19:49	00:19:51	Well, we're following a lead in the Janet Warren case.
307	00:19:51	00:19:52	Oh, yeah.
308	00:19:52	00:19:54	Heard about that in morning briefing.
309	00:19:54	00:19:55	I know you.
310	00:19:55	00:19:57	You're a CSI.
311	00:19:57	00:19:58	Fired a couple years ago, yeah?
312	00:19:58	00:20:00	Uh, resigned in lieu of.
313	00:20:00	00:20:06	Officer Louie, we would like to ask you some questions about your 1987 Hardison High class ring.
314	00:20:06	00:20:07	The one you lost?
315	00:20:07	00:20:10	Thought you were working the Janet Warren case.
316	00:20:10	00:20:11	Oh, we are.
317	00:20:11	00:20:14	CSI Finlay here's with the Vegas lab these days.
318	00:20:14	00:20:16	We found your ring in our mass grave.
319	00:20:18	00:20:20	That sounds like an accusation.
320	00:20:20	00:20:21	Do I need my guild rep, Mikey?
321	00:20:21	00:20:23	No. Just tell us how you lost the ring.
322	00:20:25	00:20:27	Well, I didn't lose it.
323	00:20:27	00:20:29	I gave it to my high school sweetheart.
324	00:20:29	00:20:33	She told me she lost it, right after she dumped me for the quarterback.
325	00:20:33	00:20:35	Well, I figured she tossed it.
326	00:20:35	00:20:37	Marla always was a bitch.
327	00:20:37	00:20:39	Have you seen this bitch lately?
328	00:20:39	00:20:41	Yeah. In the kitchen.
329	00:20:41	00:20:43	I married her.
330	00:20:43	00:20:44	Marla!
331	00:20:47	00:20:49	These guys want to ask you some questions.
332	00:20:49	00:20:50	They're okay, yeah?
333	00:20:50	00:20:52	I gotta get back to work.
334	00:20:52	00:20:53	If you're done with me.
335	00:20:53	00:20:55	Yeah. Thank you. All right.
336	00:20:58	00:20:59	Coffee?
337	00:20:59	00:21:01	Sure.
338	00:21:01	00:21:02	Fresh pot.
339	00:21:02	00:21:04	Thank you. Sure.
340	00:21:04	00:21:07	Yeah, I know Eric doesn't believe me, but I did lose his class ring.
341	00:21:07	00:21:09	Wore it on a chain.
342	00:21:09	00:21:10	It could've fallen off anywhere.
343	00:21:10	00:21:12	I was kind of wild back then.
344	00:21:12	00:21:16	Do you know where you might have lost it, or what you might have been doing?
345	00:21:16	00:21:17	Dating most of the football team?
346	00:21:17	00:21:19	Eric went through the cheerleaders.
347	00:21:19	00:21:21	We were young, then.
348	00:21:21	00:21:24	Did you ever date a guy named Tom Cooley?
349	00:21:24	00:21:26	No way.
350	00:21:26	00:21:30	I-I did date his best friend, for a week or two.
351	00:21:30	00:21:31	Max Liston?
352	00:21:31	00:21:33	Quarterback.
353	00:21:33	00:21:35	Really got Eric thinking about me.
354	00:21:35	00:21:37	You think...
355	00:21:37	00:21:39	Tom is responsible for all those girls?
356	00:21:41	00:21:42	Did he kill them?
357	00:21:42	00:21:43	Well, that's what we're investigating.
358	00:21:45	00:21:48	Did you and Max ever hang out with Tom? Once.
359	00:21:48	00:21:51	Max took me to a party at Tom Cooley's ranch.
360	00:21:51	00:21:54	High-class booze, beer in bottles...
361	00:21:54	00:21:56	kind of a step up for me.
362	00:21:56	00:21:58	Was that around the time that you lost the ring?
363	00:21:58	00:22:01	Maybe.
364	00:22:01	00:22:05	I don't know. If I knew where it went, it wouldn't be lost.
365	00:22:05	00:22:08	Like I said, I only went out with Max a couple of times.
366	00:22:08	00:22:11	Anyone besides me need a refill on the coffee?
367	00:22:11	00:22:14	No, no, I'm good, thanks.
368	00:22:14	00:22:16	She's hiding something.
369	00:22:16	00:22:18	Yeah.
370	00:22:20	00:22:22	Look, her husband's a cop, you know?
371	00:22:22	00:22:26	If Marla Louie is hiding something, it could simply be something she doesn't want her husband to know.
372	00:22:26	00:22:29	And that would make you zero-for-two up there.
373	00:22:29	00:22:34	Is that your nice way of telling me that I shouldn't have come up here without getting your permission?
374	00:22:34	00:22:35	You shouldn't have gone up, period.
375	00:22:35	00:22:37	I mean, come on, what are you doing, Jules?
376	00:22:37	00:22:39	Are you trying to kill your career?
377	00:22:39	00:22:45	Marla Louie dated Tom Cooley's best friend in high school, this guy named Max Liston, all right?
378	00:22:45	00:22:48	I'm gonna send you a link.
379	00:22:51	00:22:57	Max Liston, small-time Seattle contractor, gets big break.
380	00:22:57	00:23:01	Cooley hired Liston to develop the family ranch.
381	00:23:01	00:23:04	Not just to develop, but to pave over eight graves.
382	00:23:04	00:23:14	If I wanted to dig up eight bodies in Seattle and rebury them in Nevada, I'd would definitely negotiate with my contractor best buddy.
383	00:23:14	00:23:15	Can we prove any of this?
384	00:23:15	00:23:17	Well, here's where I go 1-for-3.
385	00:23:17	00:23:22	Max Liston became an instant millionaire, and he retired to the Virgin Islands.
386	00:23:22	00:23:25	Hey, don't even think about taking an island cruise.
387	00:23:25	00:23:26	Well, you don't have to worry.
388	00:23:26	00:23:28	Even I couldn't get this guy to talk.
389	00:23:28	00:23:33	So Max Liston gets a truckload of money and dies three weeks later.
390	00:23:33	00:23:38	I'd be interested to know what Tom Cooley was doing while Max was flunking scuba diving.
391	00:23:38	00:23:41	Boss, you might want to turn on the TV.
392	00:23:41	00:23:42	Really? Okay.
393	00:23:46	00:23:55	Today I've come to Las Vegas to offer a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer of Janet Warren.
394	00:23:55	00:24:06	In the last 24 hours, Las Vegas PD has confirmed the bodies of Janet Warren and seven other young women were recovered from a mass grave 200 miles from here.
395	00:24:06	00:24:14	Two years ago, a chance meeting with Janet at a public restaurant on the last night of her life, turned my life into a nightmare.
396	00:24:14	00:24:16	Look at that.
397	00:24:16	00:24:18	He's making this about himself. Now he's the victim.
398	00:24:18	00:24:20	...my reputation destroyed.
399	00:24:20	00:24:27	I have been pursued with a vengeance by an overzealous CSI who has had no regard whatsoever for the evidence.
400	00:24:29	00:24:31	Jules, you mind putting down the coffee mug?
401	00:24:31	00:24:32	Can you believe this?!
402	00:24:32	00:24:36	...cost her her job...
403	00:24:36	00:24:39	but it cost me everything.
404	00:24:39	00:24:41	The killer of Janet Warren is still out there.
405	00:24:41	00:24:43	Let's all of us work together to get him.
406	00:24:43	00:24:45	Scumbag!
407	00:24:45	00:24:46	He's playing games with us.
408	00:24:46	00:24:48	He thinks we're too stupid to catch him.
409	00:24:48	00:24:51	No! Not the TV!
410	00:24:51	00:24:52	It's my TV. I paid for it.
411	00:24:57	00:24:59	What you got? Hey.
412	00:24:59	00:25:02	Okay, well, this is where we found the bodies.
413	00:25:02	00:25:06	It's federal land that was taken from a private party by eminent domain.
414	00:25:06	00:25:08	It was part of a big government land grab in the '90s.
415	00:25:08	00:25:12	A Covenant of Appurtenant. What the hell's that?
416	00:25:12	00:25:14	It's a lawyer's way of saying that land can never be developed.
417	00:25:14	00:25:16	Good place to bury a body.
418	00:25:16	00:25:18	No one's ever digging it up.
419	00:25:18	00:25:21	Who was the previous owner?
420	00:25:21	00:25:27	It was buried under layers of straw corporations, but the law firm that handled the deal was Denton, Rutman and Schmidt.
421	00:25:27	00:25:31	Whoa. Now, they are the biggest real estate firm in Seattle.
422	00:25:31	00:25:33	Really?
423	00:25:33	00:25:36	Tom Cooley's family made all their money in real estate.
424	00:25:36	00:25:38	So that could've been Cooley land.
425	00:25:38	00:25:41	It it was, that would be enough to compel his DNA.
426	00:25:41	00:25:43	Yes, sir, it would.
427	00:25:43	00:25:45	My client will not be offering up his DNA.
428	00:25:45	00:25:48	We both know that particular glass is off the table.
429	00:25:48	00:25:51	How is CSI Finlay?
430	00:25:51	00:25:52	She's terrific.
431	00:25:52	00:25:57	Mr. Pearson, if your client wants to be so helpful, what the hell's he doing hanging out in the hall?
432	00:25:57	00:25:59	He's just waiting for me to make sure his rights will be protected.
433	00:25:59	00:26:00	This isn't Guantanamo.
434	00:26:00	00:26:02	(chuckles) Okay.
435	00:26:02	00:26:03	Tom?
436	00:26:06	00:26:08	Captain Jim Brass, Tom Cooley.
437	00:26:08	00:26:11	Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
438	00:26:11	00:26:12	Sit down.
439	00:26:12	00:26:19	Now, Seattle PD was investigating you as a suspect in the murder of Janet Warren.
440	00:26:19	00:26:24	Here in Las Vegas, I'm making you the prime suspect in the murder of Stephanie Hollinger.
441	00:26:24	00:26:28	Sunshine Vanletti, five Jane Does and Janet Warren.
442	00:26:28	00:26:30	Well, this is no way to start a relationship, Jim.
443	00:26:30	00:26:32	Captain Brass, we came here...
444	00:26:32	00:26:36	I've had a crash course in the legal system in the last couple years.
445	00:26:36	00:26:38	You can't arrest me just because you don't like me.
446	00:26:38	00:26:42	If I could arrest you, you'd already be in a holding cell.
447	00:26:43	00:26:48	Now, the victims we've identified so far were all last seen a few blocks from your office.
448	00:26:48	00:26:49	Heart of downtown Seattle.
449	00:26:49	00:26:51	Population half a million.
450	00:26:51	00:26:55	And the evidence suggests that the bodies were buried in Seattle, then reburied here in Nevada.
451	00:26:55	00:26:56	Now, that requires logistics.
452	00:26:56	00:26:58	I mean like a dump truck and a backhoe.
453	00:27:00	00:27:03	It's a shame about your friend Max Liston.
454	00:27:03	00:27:05	We understand he did a lot of construction work for you.
455	00:27:05	00:27:07	Max was a dear friend and a good man.
456	00:27:07	00:27:08	If you're suggesting...
457	00:27:08	00:27:11	I'm not suggesting anything.
458	00:27:11	00:27:16	But what I don't get is, why did you rebury them 1,200 miles from home?
459	00:27:16	00:27:18	What happened in Seattle?
460	00:27:18	00:27:21	CSI Finlay put your feet too close to the fire?
461	00:27:21	00:27:23	You had to get out of state? Okay, that's it.
462	00:27:23	00:27:24	Captain, we're done here.
463	00:27:24	00:27:27	These unsubstantiated accusations, they're bordering on slander.
464	00:27:27	00:27:28	And I was just getting started.
465	00:27:28	00:27:32	We're staying at the Mediterranean, if there's anything else we can do.
466	00:27:32	00:27:36	Mr. Cooley, thank you for coming in, but don't leave Las Vegas.
467	00:28:10	00:28:11	What the hell...?
468	00:28:11	00:28:13	Ah, single malt.
469	00:28:13	00:28:17	One bottle down, one to go. Nice.
470	00:28:19	00:28:21	Hey, could you give me your glass when you're done?
471	00:28:21	00:28:22	I was hoping I'd see you.
472	00:28:24	00:28:27	How about a drink?
473	00:28:27	00:28:30	Yeah, that's how it all starts, huh?
474	00:28:30	00:28:32	Some blonde catches your eye.
475	00:28:32	00:28:35	Young, athletic, looking for a good time.
476	00:28:35	00:28:37	And you buy her a drink.
477	00:28:37	00:28:39	Hell, maybe three.
478	00:28:39	00:28:42	And you add a little sweetener; a little flunitrazepam.
479	00:28:44	00:28:46	Must be hard for a guy like you to sleep at night.
480	00:28:46	00:28:50	You spend a lot of time thinking about me.
481	00:28:50	00:28:51	I'm flattered.
482	00:28:51	00:28:53	I'm just getting started.
483	00:28:53	00:28:56	Just like you, I don't want the party to end.
484	00:28:56	00:28:58	So what happens next, huh?
485	00:28:58	00:29:01	You say say something like, uh...
486	00:29:01	00:29:08	Hey, baby, just a short drive to my big fancy ranch.
487	00:29:08	00:29:18	And then, in her car, you get the sex part out of the way because you can't wait to get home and get your hands around their necks.
488	00:29:20	00:29:22	I am your type, aren't I?
489	00:29:24	00:29:26	Five-foot four, blonde...
490	00:29:26	00:29:29	I'm looking for a good time.
491	00:29:29	00:29:33	But I don't expect much from you in bed...
492	00:29:33	00:29:35	'cause you're inadequate.
493	00:29:36	00:29:38	Is that your trigger?
494	00:29:38	00:29:43	How do you know I'm not gonna kill you, hmm?
495	00:29:43	00:29:47	That's what makes it so exciting.
496	00:29:59	00:30:01	Hey, Jim.
497	00:30:01	00:30:03	Uh, she should be here in a few minutes.
498	00:30:03	00:30:05	Landed about an hour ago.
499	00:30:05	00:30:07	Why? What's up?
500	00:30:07	00:30:09	Oh.
501	00:30:09	00:30:12	Okay, I'll be right there.
502	00:30:14	00:30:15	Hey.
503	00:30:15	00:30:16	Hi.
504	00:30:16	00:30:20	I just got a 419 at the Mediterranean.
505	00:30:20	00:30:26	Sounds like Tom Cooley just committed suicide, sometime in the last couple hours.
506	00:30:26	00:30:28	Try in the last 30 minutes.
507	00:30:30	00:30:32	Look, I know you're angry.
508	00:30:32	00:30:34	I know you think I let you down.
509	00:30:34	00:30:36	But I'm not the same person I was two years ago.
510	00:30:36	00:30:38	So you weren't in Cooley's suite?
511	00:30:38	00:30:39	I can explain.
512	00:30:39	00:30:40	Look, come here...
513	00:30:40	00:30:43	But Dad, the soda machine stole my dollar.
514	00:30:43	00:30:44	It's Vegas, kiddo.
515	00:30:44	00:30:46	Stick to the table games.
516	00:30:46	00:30:47	Internal Affairs is gonna ask me questions.
517	00:30:47	00:30:49	So you be very careful what you say.
518	00:30:49	00:30:51	I'm not gonna lie for you.
519	00:30:51	00:30:56	Let's go. Mr. Pearson, this officer's gonna accompany you to the police station, take your statement.
520	00:30:56	00:30:57	Yeah, of course.
521	00:30:57	00:30:59	I can't even begin to understand this.
522	00:30:59	00:31:00	What do we got?
523	00:31:00	00:31:04	Gavin Pearson, Tom Cooley's lawyer.
524	00:31:04	00:31:06	Supposed to meet Cooley at the bar.
525	00:31:06	00:31:07	Cooley was a no-show.
526	00:31:07	00:31:08	He came up here looking for him.
527	00:31:08	00:31:12	Banging the door, there was no response, so he called hotel security, and they cut their way in.
528	00:31:12	00:31:13	Can I get a little help here?
529	00:31:13	00:31:15	Yeah. Charles, keep your eye on him.
530	00:31:15	00:31:17	You mind? No, go ahead.
531	00:31:17	00:31:18	No, no, hold on.
532	00:31:20	00:31:33	So a room service waiter gave a statement on the record that said he saw an angry blonde woman with police credentials and a service pistol banging on the door of Cooley's suite a half an hour before Security arrived.
533	00:31:33	00:31:35	Now tell me that isn't you.
534	00:31:38	00:31:41	Stay here--I'm gonna need to take your statement.
535	00:31:41	00:31:43	You know, this isn't just your job on the line.
536	00:31:49	00:31:52	Wow. Unusual way to hang yourself.
537	00:31:52	00:31:55	Usually, you find them hanging from the sprinkler head or a curtain rod.
538	00:31:55	00:31:59	As long as the hang point's longer than your torso...
539	00:31:59	00:32:02	that's all it takes.
540	00:32:07	00:32:10	Are we gonna find your fingerprints on one of these glasses?
541	00:32:10	00:32:13	Flunitrazepam. This is the drug that Henry's finding in all his victims.
542	00:32:15	00:32:17	Both of the doors were locked from the inside.
543	00:32:17	00:32:19	That works in your favor.
544	00:32:19	00:32:24	A narcissist does not hold a press conference and then, a few hours later, kill himself.
545	00:32:24	00:32:26	Are you sure that's the argument you want to make?
546	00:32:26	00:32:28	Yeah. It's a homicide.
547	00:32:28	00:32:30	And we need to find out who did it.
548	00:32:30	00:32:33	Well, whatever happened here, you're finally gonna get your DNA sample.
549	00:32:40	00:32:44	If I were Janet Warren's mother, I'd feel cheated.
550	00:32:44	00:32:49	I'd want to face this guy down in court, tell the world what he did, and watch him be punished for his crimes.
551	00:32:49	00:32:51	Well, not in this lifetime.
552	00:32:51	00:32:54	So what are you thinking for C.O.D.?
553	00:32:54	00:32:57	Asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation.
554	00:32:57	00:32:59	Suicide versus homicide, still undetermined.
555	00:32:59	00:33:04	Henry found flunitrazepam, 50 micrograms per milliliter.
556	00:33:04	00:33:06	BAC was point two-one.
557	00:33:06	00:33:09	Alcohol three times the legal level, plus a heavy sedative.
558	00:33:09	00:33:11	Finn said he was wasted.
559	00:33:11	00:33:14	And tying a knot requires a certain dexterity.
560	00:33:14	00:33:15	Think he could accomplish that?
561	00:33:15	00:33:16	Eh, maybe, maybe not.
562	00:33:16	00:33:19	Mr. Cooley here had a fatty liver.
563	00:33:19	00:33:20	He was a boozer.
564	00:33:20	00:33:23	And most likely, he built up a tolerance.
565	00:33:23	00:33:26	Okay, until we're certain, we're treating this as a homicide.
566	00:33:26	00:33:27	I got Cooley's DNA results.
567	00:33:27	00:33:32	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Out of my autopsy until you've been cleared as a suspect, okay?
568	00:33:35	00:33:38	Did you give your statement to Brass yet?
569	00:33:38	00:33:40	I'm waiting for his call.
570	00:33:40	00:33:46	Cooley's DNA matches the semen we found in Janet Warren's car two years ago.
571	00:33:46	00:33:47	Okay, it's official.
572	00:33:47	00:33:48	He killed Janet.
573	00:33:48	00:33:50	That solves one murder.
574	00:33:50	00:33:51	Yeah, how about all eight.
575	00:33:51	00:33:54	This guy has been murdering women for the last 20 years.
576	00:33:54	00:33:58	I don't think he suddenly grew a conscience and committed suicide.
577	00:33:58	00:34:00	So what's the motive for murdering him, then?
578	00:34:00	00:34:03	Cooley's not the type to get his hands dirty.
579	00:34:03	00:34:06	We believe that he had help moving the bodies.
580	00:34:06	00:34:07	Max Liston.
581	00:34:07	00:34:08	But he drowned.
582	00:34:08	00:34:09	He's out.
583	00:34:09	00:34:11	Cooley's got another best friend.
584	00:34:11	00:34:14	So, Cooley goes down, his best friend would go down.
585	00:34:14	00:34:16	Cooley's dead, case closed.
586	00:34:17	00:34:18	So, who is it?
587	00:34:18	00:34:20	I don't know.
588	00:34:20	00:34:23	But I think I know someone who might.
589	00:34:23	00:34:25	You call me.
590	00:34:30	00:34:36	Look, I'm sorry that you wasted a trip, but I already told you everything I remember.
591	00:34:36	00:34:39	Well, you must know by now that Tom Cooley is dead.
592	00:34:39	00:34:40	He can't hurt you anymore.
593	00:34:40	00:34:41	Who said he ever hurt me?
594	00:34:41	00:34:43	Marla, listen to me.
595	00:34:43	00:34:46	Okay, I was kind of a wild girl in high school, too.
596	00:34:46	00:34:50	Girl with a reputation-- she gets invited to a lot of parties.
597	00:34:50	00:34:54	And sometimes, those parties would just be me and a couple other guys.
598	00:34:56	00:34:57	You know what I'm saying?
599	00:34:57	00:35:02	Expectations of my boyfriend of the weekend and those other guys.
600	00:35:05	00:35:07	There are eight girls dead.
601	00:35:07	00:35:09	You are so lucky to be alive.
602	00:35:09	00:35:11	Marla, you've got three kids.
603	00:35:11	00:35:13	What if something happened to one of them?
604	00:35:13	00:35:15	Wouldn't you want the person who knew the truth to come forward?
605	00:35:15	00:35:16	The bastard's dead.
606	00:35:16	00:35:18	What difference does it make now, anyway?
607	00:35:18	00:35:20	Somebody helped him cover it all up.
608	00:35:20	00:35:22	Probably the same guy who killed him.
609	00:35:22	00:35:25	And that guy deserves to be punished.
610	00:35:31	00:35:34	Eric doesn't know about that night.
611	00:35:35	00:35:36	I didn't want to lose him.
612	00:35:36	00:35:37	I don't want to lose him.
613	00:35:37	00:35:39	This is just the three of us talking.
614	00:35:39	00:35:42	Marla, you're the only one who can speak for those eight girls.
615	00:35:47	00:35:52	You were right, about the party.
616	00:35:52	00:35:55	It was just me and three horny boys.
617	00:35:55	00:35:57	Max, Gavin...
618	00:35:57	00:35:59	Gavin?
619	00:36:00	00:36:01	Gavin Pearson?
620	00:36:01	00:36:03	Yeah, the tagalong.
621	00:36:03	00:36:05	And Tom Cooley.
622	00:36:08	00:36:09	Cheers.
623	00:36:09	00:36:13	Back then, I didn't know how to say no.
624	00:36:13	00:36:19	You know, I could usually hold my booze, but that night, I blacked out, and I woke up in the bottom of a hole.
625	00:36:19	00:36:20	She's moving.
626	00:36:20	00:36:21	Bastards were burying me.
627	00:36:21	00:36:24	I didn't tell you to stop!
628	00:36:27	00:36:29	What are you doing?
629	00:36:32	00:36:33	Town whore!
630	00:36:33	00:36:35	No one's gonna believe you, anyway!
631	00:36:35	00:36:36	He was right.
632	00:36:36	00:36:38	The Cooleys owned the town.
633	00:36:38	00:36:40	No one would've believed me.
634	00:36:40	00:36:43	And even if they did, Tom was untouchable.
635	00:36:43	00:36:45	What about Max and Gavin?
636	00:36:45	00:36:48	They never spoke to me again.
637	00:36:48	00:36:53	Marla, you should know that you probably did not pass out just from booze.
638	00:36:53	00:36:55	Cooley liked to roofie his victims.
639	00:36:58	00:37:00	Did he rape you?
640	00:37:04	00:37:10	We know Cooley was still alive at 9 That's when room service delivered his second bottle of scotch.
641	00:37:10	00:37:18	Waiter passed Finn in the hallway as he was leaving, and we picked her up on hotel surveillance 47.
642	00:37:18	00:37:21	Presumably, Cooley was still breathing.
643	00:37:21	00:37:22	What about Pearson?
644	00:37:22	00:37:25	18.
645	00:37:25	00:37:29	Surveillance picked him up in the casino, 20.
646	00:37:29	00:37:32	21.
647	00:37:32	00:37:34	He called Cooley-- no answer.
648	00:37:34	00:37:38	24, at which point he called hotel security.
649	00:37:38	00:37:41	So Pearson had a window of three minutes to kill Cooley.
650	00:37:41	00:37:45	Takes at least 20 minutes for drugs to be absorbed from the stomach.
651	00:37:47	00:37:51	Pearson admitted he had drinks with Cooley up in the room earlier.
652	00:37:51	00:37:57	So that gave him access to the man's scotch and his drugs.
653	00:38:02	00:38:05	Plenty of time for them to kick in.
654	00:38:06	00:38:09	Cooley would've been passed out by the time Pearson came back upstairs.
655	00:38:09	00:38:15	So all Pearson had to do was string him up and let gravity do the rest.
656	00:38:18	00:38:21	I'm with you, Sherlock, but there's only one problem.
657	00:38:23	00:38:24	Both doors to the room were locked.
658	00:38:24	00:38:26	From the inside.
659	00:38:26	00:38:30	So how did the killer get out of the room?
660	00:38:30	00:38:32	Same way he got in.
661	00:38:35	00:38:41	After Cooley's death, Pearson's key card stopped working.
662	00:38:44	00:38:45	Need a little help here.
663	00:38:45	00:38:47	Is that significant?
664	00:38:47	00:38:49	I mean, aren't those things always getting demagnetized?
665	00:38:49	00:38:52	Yeah, you're absolutely right.
666	00:38:52	00:38:56	But, Dad, the soda machine stole my dollar.
667	00:38:56	00:38:58	That's Vegas, kiddo. Stick to the table games.
668	00:39:10	00:39:11	Out of order.
669	00:39:11	00:39:15	I'm sure you can get a soda on another floor.
670	00:39:30	00:39:32	It's a magnet.
671	00:39:32	00:39:33	How'd you know...?
672	00:39:33	00:39:35	Pearson's key card got demagnetized, right?
673	00:39:35	00:39:37	Kid lost his money in the soda machine.
674	00:39:37	00:39:41	Okay, so how does that help Pearson kill Cooley?
675	00:39:41	00:39:45	Pearson got into the room using this magnet.
676	00:39:56	00:39:57	Got out the same way.
677	00:39:57	00:40:01	Then he probably pocketed the magnet.
678	00:40:01	00:40:03	That's when he wiped out his key card.
679	00:40:03	00:40:05	He's a lawyer, so he knows he can't get caught with it.
680	00:40:05	00:40:08	So he sticks it to the back of the soda machine and fries the circuit board.
681	00:40:08	00:40:11	Guess we're lucky he didn't stick it behind the ice machine.
682	00:40:11	00:40:13	We would never have known.
683	00:40:13	00:40:15	You killed your best friend.
684	00:40:15	00:40:18	And your biggest client.
685	00:40:18	00:40:21	Well, you know how this works.
686	00:40:21	00:40:27	If you cooperate, things can go easier.
687	00:40:27	00:40:29	Now, I have eight victims.
688	00:40:29	00:40:32	Four Jane Does.
689	00:40:35	00:40:38	I need names.
690	00:40:44	00:40:46	Sarah Jones.
691	00:40:46	00:40:50	Tiffany Alcott.
692	00:40:50	00:40:53	Jennifer Sutterman.
693	00:40:53	00:40:55	Kinley Summer.
694	00:41:01	00:41:08	I have met a lot of people searching for missing loved ones over these past two years.
695	00:41:08	00:41:15	Parents who are willing to do anything to bring their babies home, searching for answers.
696	00:41:15	00:41:17	But I was lucky. I had you.
697	00:41:17	00:41:21	And you wanted to find Janet as badly as I did.
698	00:41:21	00:41:23	I only wish that I could have brought her home to you.
699	00:41:26	00:41:27	You did.
700	00:41:43	00:41:45	You should feel good right now.
701	00:41:45	00:41:46	Yeah.
702	00:41:46	00:41:51	Two years, two jobs, one marriage.
703	00:41:52	00:41:53	But I got him.
704	00:41:53	00:41:55	Yeah, most people would've given up.
705	00:41:55	00:41:59	I'm sorry that I sometimes go too far.
706	00:41:59	00:42:01	I'm really working on that side of my personality.
707	00:42:03	00:42:05	Thanks for sticking by me.
708	00:42:05	00:42:08	You're welcome.
709	00:42:08	00:42:11	You miss me, don't you?
710	00:42:13	00:42:14	Sometimes.
711	00:42:14	00:42:17	Sometimes I miss you.
712	00:42:23	00:42:26	All right, you ready to get to the airport?
713	00:42:26	00:42:28	There's a flight in the morning.
