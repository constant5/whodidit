0	00:00:17	00:00:20	We invite the Ritthamels for wine and they don't show up?
1	00:00:20	00:00:22	I mean, really, what's next?
2	00:00:24	00:00:26	Honey...
3	00:00:26	00:00:27	what's that?
4	00:00:27	00:00:30	I don't think that's the Ritthamels.
5	00:00:35	00:00:36	Mother of...
6	00:00:46	00:00:49	Male, Caucasian, in his 30s.
7	00:00:49	00:00:52	And this is how he rolls.
8	00:00:52	00:00:55	Volume of blood loss, lack of visible cardio activity.
9	00:00:55	00:00:56	He's definitely dead.
10	00:00:56	00:00:58	Couldn't have traveled far.
11	00:00:58	00:01:01	These folks recognize him as a neighbor?
12	00:01:01	00:01:02	Yes, Bryce and Bunny.
13	00:01:02	00:01:09	They never saw him before, so police officers are knocking on doors asking the neighbors if anyone witnessed his wild ride.
14	00:01:09	00:01:10	Well, what do you think, David?
15	00:01:10	00:01:14	This doesn't look like the kind of damage you'd get from just being tumbled around, does it?
16	00:01:14	00:01:15	I think you're right.
17	00:01:15	00:01:20	Severe blunt-force injuries, primarily to the head and face.
18	00:01:20	00:01:21	So, obviously a murder.
19	00:01:21	00:01:24	Have you ever seen anything like this?
20	00:01:24	00:01:25	Actually, I have.
21	00:01:25	00:01:27	It's a human hamster ball, I believe.
22	00:01:27	00:01:30	Saw one of these at the state fair with Charlie once.
23	00:01:30	00:01:36	It's airtight, waterproof, you can roll around in a pool for five bucks until you lose your corn dogs.
24	00:01:36	00:01:38	State fair corn dogs.
25	00:01:38	00:01:41	That sounds slightly more fun than this guy's experience.
26	00:01:41	00:01:46	All right, so we have to figure out who he is, where he came from and what in the spinning world happened to him.
27	00:01:46	00:01:52	Our entire crime scene is inside of this bubble, David, so I want you to get this back to the coroner's office, intact.
28	00:01:52	00:01:54	Seriously?
29	00:01:54	00:01:56	Y-You want me to put that...
30	00:01:56	00:01:57	in my van?
31	00:01:57	00:01:59	That'd be nice.
32	00:02:01	00:02:03	Have a ball.
33	00:03:21	00:03:23	Brody.
34	00:03:23	00:03:26	Heard you guys have a big, bloody ball of bad to work on.
35	00:03:26	00:03:29	(chuckles) Well, grave shift always gets the good ones.
36	00:03:29	00:03:31	Glad us swing shift guys are done.
37	00:03:31	00:03:33	Heard you got a sexual assault call, too.
38	00:03:33	00:03:34	Gonna be a busy night.
39	00:03:34	00:03:36	I'll drink my first one for you, huh?
40	00:03:36	00:03:38	Mm-hmm. (laughs)
41	00:03:38	00:03:40	Let him gloat.
42	00:03:40	00:03:43	I don't really like anybody that goes to bed before sunrise, anyways.
43	00:03:43	00:03:45	Agreed.
44	00:03:45	00:03:47	Hey, Morgan? The sexual assault call.
45	00:03:47	00:03:51	It's got to be our guy. Similar victim and location. Oh.
46	00:03:51	00:03:53	Oh, sorry. Dawn. Banks.
47	00:03:53	00:03:55	Swing shift. Hi. Seen you around. Greg.
48	00:03:55	00:04:03	Hi. Dawn and I worked separate home invasion rapes last week, realized we might be dealing with a serial. Yeah, looks like he might have struck again.
49	00:04:03	00:04:06	Do, uh, you mind if I work this one with you?
50	00:04:06	00:04:08	I don't sleep anyway.
51	00:04:08	00:04:11	Oh, um, sure. Great. I can head out to the scene.
52	00:04:11	00:04:13	The victim's waiting at PD. All right, I'll talk to her.
53	00:04:13	00:04:15	Okay.
54	00:04:15	00:04:17	Good luck.
55	00:04:20	00:04:23	I didn't see him.
56	00:04:23	00:04:26	I-I didn't hear him.
57	00:04:26	00:04:29	I didn't know anything happened until I woke up.
58	00:04:29	00:04:31	Tell me what you can about your night, Amy.
59	00:04:31	00:04:34	What do you remember before you went to bed?
60	00:04:34	00:04:37	00.
61	00:04:37	00:04:40	I'm-I'm a cocktail waitress.
62	00:04:40	00:04:42	Fell asleep in bed watching TV.
63	00:04:42	00:04:46	When I woke up, my head felt all cloudy.
64	00:04:49	00:04:52	And... I was...
65	00:04:55	00:04:56	...hurting.
66	00:04:56	00:05:01	I promise you, Amy, we're not gonna stop until we hunt this animal down.
67	00:05:01	00:05:08	I saw something on the news, that a girl got attacked last week a mile from my place.
68	00:05:08	00:05:10	Was this the same guy?
69	00:05:13	00:05:15	I processed Amy's condo.
70	00:05:15	00:05:17	Point of entry was the back door.
71	00:05:17	00:05:20	The intruder used a bump key to bust open the lock.
72	00:05:22	00:05:27	Just like the other scenes. Yeah, I found some rubble, crushed shells, just like the last scene.
73	00:05:27	00:05:31	Confirms it's the same guy. Yeah. It's just, this stuff is used to pave so many driveways around town.
74	00:05:31	00:05:33	Could have picked it up anywhere.
75	00:05:33	00:05:37	Found a few small pebbles of a different rocky material.
76	00:05:37	00:05:40	Oh, and fibers from a chloroform rag.
77	00:05:40	00:05:44	He knocked Amy out, just like the others. And then, again with the TV.
78	00:05:44	00:05:47	The rapist turns it on and leaves it on.
79	00:05:47	00:05:48	He actually didn't turn it on at Amy's.
80	00:05:48	00:05:52	She said she likes to fall asleep to the news, so she left it on.
81	00:05:52	00:05:57	So this time, there's one less thing on his sick, twisted to-do list.
82	00:06:03	00:06:05	You know them?
83	00:06:05	00:06:07	Yeah, I-I thought it was my son, Tyler.
84	00:06:07	00:06:10	I bought him a jacket like that last Christmas.
85	00:06:12	00:06:15	He's 19. He comes home every couple of weeks.
86	00:06:15	00:06:21	I try to get him to stay, but then he wants to use in the house, and then he's gone and...
87	00:06:22	00:06:25	He's just out there.
88	00:06:26	00:06:27	You said you don't sleep.
89	00:06:29	00:06:30	You worry.
90	00:06:34	00:06:44	No I.D. on our victim, so we're hoping that the trace from the outside of the ball will help us determine its path, and where it came from will help us with who he is.
91	00:06:44	00:06:47	Well, however bumpy his path, that's not what killed him.
92	00:06:47	00:06:52	Intracerebral hemorrhage from blunt-force trauma is what bounced him from this mortal coil.
93	00:06:52	00:06:56	He was beaten with some sort of hard implement.
94	00:06:56	00:07:00	Small striking surface, semicircular lacerations. Hmm.
95	00:07:00	00:07:02	There were marks in his second skin, as well.
96	00:07:02	00:07:04	Second skin?
97	00:07:04	00:07:06	I think I missed that anatomy class.
98	00:07:06	00:07:09	The thin vinyl of the ball was caught between the weapon and the victim.
99	00:07:09	00:07:14	So the victim was inside the ball, the assailant was outside of it.
100	00:07:14	00:07:17	And the weapon made distinct tool marks at the points of impact.
101	00:07:17	00:07:19	What's the brown trace?
102	00:07:19	00:07:21	Those are paint flecks.
103	00:07:21	00:07:25	So, shape of the marks plus the brown color could help us identify the weapon.
104	00:07:25	00:07:28	Well, at least something good rolled this victim's way.
105	00:07:32	00:07:36	Forensic nurse exam was very helpful.
106	00:07:36	00:07:39	A swab of Amy Morse's neck found male DNA and amylase.
107	00:07:39	00:07:42	He kissed her. Yeah. Unfortunately, there wasn't a hit in CODIS.
108	00:07:42	00:07:45	But at least now we have a profile on him.
109	00:07:45	00:07:46	So, gets us a little closer.
110	00:07:46	00:07:48	Just not close enough to stop him.
111	00:07:51	00:07:53	You okay there, Hodges?
112	00:07:53	00:07:56	You're familiar with the snowball effect?
113	00:07:56	00:08:01	A sphere in motion tumbles along, picking up mass?
114	00:08:01	00:08:04	Yeah? Well, the human hamster ball effect is worse.
115	00:08:04	00:08:05	Because it affects me.
116	00:08:05	00:08:11	To the tune of 37 different plant trace exemplars, each of which I am tasked with identifying.
117	00:08:11	00:08:12	That sucks.
118	00:08:15	00:08:16	I like you.
119	00:08:16	00:08:23	Now, before this avalanche came tumbling down on me, I ran the very reasonable amount of trace that you two brought me.
120	00:08:23	00:08:26	Crushed shell, just like at the previous scene.
121	00:08:26	00:08:28	What about the other rubble we found at the point of entry?
122	00:08:28	00:08:30	A little more interesting.
123	00:08:30	00:08:32	Concrete and titanium oxide.
124	00:08:32	00:08:35	Otherwise known as smog-eating concrete.
125	00:08:35	00:08:37	A new, unique material that helps reduce pollution.
126	00:08:37	00:08:50	The chemical additive is activated by sunlight and turns smoggy toxins into less-harmful compounds upon contact. So where in Vegas can this stuff be found? It might help us find our assailant's point of origin.
127	00:08:50	00:08:51	It's in limited use nationally.
128	00:08:51	00:08:56	Haven't had the chance to determine if or where it might be present in Vegas.
129	00:08:56	00:08:58	I can look into it. You're busy.
130	00:08:58	00:09:01	Did I mention my fondness for you?
131	00:09:01	00:09:03	I like her.
132	00:09:05	00:09:08	All right, so where are we on this rape case?
133	00:09:08	00:09:10	Victimology shows no links between the three rape victims.
134	00:09:10	00:09:13	None of them knew each other. No shared routines.
135	00:09:13	00:09:15	No overlaps in their lives.
136	00:09:15	00:09:23	Other than being this guy's type-- early 20s, single, brunette, living alone in a first-floor condo.
137	00:09:23	00:09:34	The M.O.'s consistent, right? I mean, he waits until they're asleep, uses a bump key on the back door lock to gain entry. Except that at the first scene, he passes a wide-open window he could've used for entry.
138	00:09:34	00:09:36	He goes into the victim's bedroom.
139	00:09:36	00:09:38	Chloroforms her.
140	00:09:38	00:09:42	Turns on the TV, leaving it on while he assaults her.
141	00:09:42	00:09:46	Actually, Amy already had her television on, so he just left it playing.
142	00:09:46	00:09:48	What if it wasn't a coincidence?
143	00:09:48	00:09:49	Maybe it's significant.
144	00:09:49	00:09:52	You get the feeling that he was more prepared with Amy?
145	00:09:52	00:09:56	At the first scene, he overlooked the open window.
146	00:09:56	00:09:59	Second scene, he woke up a dog that got the neighbors all excited.
147	00:09:59	00:10:04	No missteps at Amy's house, and he picked the one night a week that she gets out of work early.
148	00:10:04	00:10:06	He might've been casing her home, known her habits.
149	00:10:06	00:10:07	It's more than that.
150	00:10:10	00:10:13	He knew he was gonna have to use a bump key to break into Amy's house.
151	00:10:16	00:10:20	He knew that she fell asleep with the TV on.
152	00:10:20	00:10:24	He re-created those conditions in the previous two scenes, because...
153	00:10:24	00:10:29	the first two rapes were rehearsals.
154	00:10:30	00:10:32	Practice runs.
155	00:10:32	00:10:35	I think Amy Morse was his intended target the whole time.
156	00:10:46	00:10:50	It could be anyone, Amy, um...
157	00:10:50	00:10:52	A customer, a coworker, a neighbor.
158	00:10:52	00:10:55	Has anyone given you unwanted attention?
159	00:10:55	00:10:59	I thought this was some random psycho attacking random women.
160	00:10:59	00:11:01	Why would I have known him?
161	00:11:01	00:11:05	We now believe the rapist may have targeted you specifically.
162	00:11:07	00:11:09	There is someone.
163	00:11:10	00:11:14	My ex-boyfriend, Jared... Wallace.
164	00:11:14	00:11:19	When I broke up with him a couple months ago, he turned awful.
165	00:11:21	00:11:24	Started sending me these e-mails.
166	00:11:30	00:11:32	When I woke up...
167	00:11:32	00:11:34	after, I...
168	00:11:36	00:11:39	I could almost smell him in the room.
169	00:11:39	00:11:40	Jared?
170	00:11:42	00:11:44	But it...
171	00:11:44	00:11:47	it was so faint, I-I thought I was imagining it, I...
172	00:11:50	00:11:52	We're gonna need to get a DNA sample from Jared.
173	00:11:52	00:11:55	Do you have anything from when you guys were dating?
174	00:11:55	00:11:58	Hairbrush, um, article of clothing...
175	00:11:58	00:12:02	I just wanted to forget him.
176	00:12:02	00:12:04	Are you even sure her story's legit?
177	00:12:04	00:12:06	Amy's a cocktail waitress.
178	00:12:06	00:12:08	That's kind of how she makes money--leading guys on.
179	00:12:08	00:12:13	She takes one home and if she regrets it, buff one of the hundred notches out of the bedpost but don't call the cops.
180	00:12:13	00:12:15	Enough, Jared.
181	00:12:15	00:12:16	He doesn't mean that.
182	00:12:16	00:12:17	This is just a stressful situation.
183	00:12:17	00:12:21	Look, Jared, we're just going to take a swab of your DNA, and then you're free to go.
184	00:12:21	00:12:23	Yeah, I don't think so.
185	00:12:23	00:12:24	It'll only take a second.
186	00:12:24	00:12:26	And last a lifetime in your database.
187	00:12:26	00:12:30	I said no, and you can't force me unless you have a warrant.
188	00:12:30	00:12:34	Mr. Wallace, as your son's attorney, perhaps you should advise...
189	00:12:34	00:12:37	I already told him no, too. Wait a minute.
190	00:12:37	00:12:41	As his attorney, I have to support his decision.
191	00:12:43	00:12:47	Well, as his dad, don't you think you should tell him to man the hell up?
192	00:12:47	00:12:51	Parent protects his kid no matter what...
193	00:12:51	00:12:53	disgusting thing the kid has done.
194	00:12:53	00:12:55	Dad can't see it.
195	00:12:55	00:12:59	Little boy who used to sit on his lap couldn't be capable of something so awful.
196	00:13:00	00:13:07	And if you are clear-eyed enough to see what he has done, what does that say about how you raised him?
197	00:13:08	00:13:11	Dad, come on, let's get out of here.
198	00:13:11	00:13:12	Hey!
199	00:13:12	00:13:19	You thought you got whatever you wanted, including Amy, and when you lost her, well...
200	00:13:19	00:13:22	If we're wrong, prove it.
201	00:13:22	00:13:23	Are you kidding me?
202	00:13:23	00:13:25	You raped her, Jared.
203	00:13:26	00:13:29	Jared, no, no, Jared, Jared, Jared.
204	00:13:29	00:13:31	Jared. You don't know who you're messing with.
205	00:13:40	00:13:42	You were hoping he would spit at you, right?
206	00:13:42	00:13:47	Big loogie in the face would have been nice, but at least a good look in his eyes let me know we're right about him.
207	00:13:52	00:13:55	Leave the prop alone.
208	00:13:55	00:13:56	You guys got something to show me?
209	00:13:56	00:13:57	Yes. (clears throat)
210	00:13:57	00:14:05	Now, you know that a rolling stiff gathers no moss, but it does gather an exhaustive assortment of flora.
211	00:14:05	00:14:13	That is the plant trace that we took off of the big ball-- Hodges I.D.'d it-- and this is a landscaping map that we got from the subdivision's gardener.
212	00:14:13	00:14:16	Each blade and bloom meticulously plotted and labeled.
213	00:14:16	00:14:27	So you're looking for one route-- probably downhill-- that makes contact with each of the plant varieties until it ends up in our unfortunate couple's front yard.
214	00:14:27	00:14:30	Took us 17 hours without a bathroom break, but we did it.
215	00:14:30	00:14:37	So we tracked the ball to its point of origin-- the backyard of one Zack Fisk.
216	00:14:42	00:14:46	The human hamster himself, rest his cardboard- chewing soul.
217	00:14:52	00:14:54	Back door's open.
218	00:14:54	00:14:57	Wide enough for the hamster ball to roll out.
219	00:14:57	00:14:59	Look at these fresh scuffs.
220	00:14:59	00:15:01	Right height for the ball.
221	00:15:01	00:15:09	So the ball knocks over the vase, spreads water over the carpet, does a few donuts right here, and out the door.
222	00:15:09	00:15:13	That is one hell of a ride before he even got out of the house.
223	00:15:15	00:15:20	He was trying to escape from whoever was wielding this.
224	00:15:20	00:15:24	Same shape as the impressions left in the hamster ball's skin.
225	00:15:24	00:15:26	Paint must have rubbed off during the assault.
226	00:15:31	00:15:34	Texture's not really conducive to prints.
227	00:15:34	00:15:36	Hmm.
228	00:15:36	00:15:40	Killer might have left this little bit of trace behind.
229	00:15:41	00:15:46	Hey, Jules, I think I just found this guy's romper room.
230	00:15:46	00:15:50	Ugh, all kinds of freaky fun.
231	00:15:52	00:15:57	Don't suppose he'll mind us looking at his computer, do you?
232	00:15:58	00:16:06	ConfinedBliss.com-- a claustrophilia oasis. I guess that's the opposite of claustrophobia, right?
233	00:16:06	00:16:08	People who get off on tight spaces.
234	00:16:08	00:16:12	Zack Fisk is in every video.
235	00:16:12	00:16:14	Well, let's go to the movies.
236	00:16:14	00:16:20	A ball like this, with a two-way zipper, is perfect for solo or partner play.
237	00:16:20	00:16:32	When sealed up, the ball contains 20 minutes' worth of oxygen, so, in 15 minutes, the air will be thinning and my lovely playmate will be...
238	00:16:32	00:16:34	in bliss.
239	00:16:34	00:16:40	Claustrophilia can bring you to full sensory nirvana.
240	00:16:40	00:16:50	The lack of space, of oxygen makes you deliciously aware of every inch and impulse of your body.
241	00:16:50	00:16:57	With the strictest of boundaries comes the most exhilarating liberation.
242	00:17:01	00:17:03	Speaking of oxygen, I could use a little.
243	00:17:05	00:17:10	Since Zack was killed inside of the ball, his playmate's a pretty good suspect, right?
244	00:17:10	00:17:11	I'll figure out who she is.
245	00:17:13	00:17:16	I got it.
246	00:17:23	00:17:25	Hey, Jules.
247	00:17:27	00:17:29	Yeah?
248	00:17:29	00:17:31	Package delivered.
249	00:17:31	00:17:34	Huh, big package shows up a day after he's murdered.
250	00:17:34	00:17:36	Could be connected.
251	00:17:36	00:17:37	What do you think? Should we open it?
252	00:17:37	00:17:38	Yeah.
253	00:17:39	00:17:42	Oh, Lord.
254	00:17:42	00:17:49	Well, whatever new pervy toys this guy just ordered, I think he went with solid steel.
255	00:17:55	00:17:58	That is no toy.
256	00:17:58	00:18:00	No, that's his playmate.
257	00:18:08	00:18:11	Dawn, it's Morgan again, following up on the case.
258	00:18:11	00:18:13	Uh, I really need to hear from you.
259	00:18:13	00:18:17	I'm just hoping you're, you're okay.
260	00:18:17	00:18:18	Please call me back.
261	00:18:18	00:18:20	Bye.
262	00:18:20	00:18:22	Everything all right?
263	00:18:22	00:18:27	Oh, uh, Dawn Banks-- she didn't show up for her shift today.
264	00:18:27	00:18:29	When's the last time you talked to her?
265	00:18:29	00:18:34	Yesterday, after she got in the face of our rape suspect Jared Wallace.
266	00:18:34	00:18:38	Well, do you want to do a welfare check, swing by her house?
267	00:18:38	00:18:40	Yeah.
268	00:18:41	00:18:43	Door's unlocked.
269	00:18:45	00:18:47	Dawn?
270	00:18:49	00:18:53	Looks like she left this place in a hurry.
271	00:18:53	00:18:56	Yeah. She was working.
272	00:18:58	00:19:04	She got a response from a smog-eating concrete company last night.
273	00:19:04	00:19:07	Rapist tracked some of that stuff into the crime scenes, right?
274	00:19:07	00:19:14	Yeah, and according to this e-mail, this stuff only exists on one half-mile strip of Verdugo Road.
275	00:19:14	00:19:15	Good lead.
276	00:19:18	00:19:20	Dawn?
277	00:19:34	00:19:38	Aah! The hell are you guys doing here, huh?!
278	00:19:38	00:19:39	Who are you guys?
279	00:19:39	00:19:40	We're CSIs.
280	00:19:42	00:19:44	It's her son.
281	00:19:44	00:19:46	Tyler?
282	00:19:46	00:19:47	We work with your mom.
283	00:19:53	00:19:55	So, when's the last time you saw her?
284	00:19:56	00:19:58	Look, I don't know where she is.
285	00:19:58	00:20:00	Okay, I haven't been here in weeks.
286	00:20:00	00:20:01	I just came to get a bite.
287	00:20:01	00:20:02	Sure.
288	00:20:02	00:20:08	If she got fed up with me, everything else, ran off to the Bahamas or something, good for her, she deserves it.
289	00:20:08	00:20:12	Other than that, I don't know what else to tell you.
290	00:20:12	00:20:14	I'm gonna get out of here, crash somewhere else.
291	00:20:14	00:20:16	Uh, Tyler, wait.
292	00:20:16	00:20:23	I know you have your own life and everything, but I know your mom has been really, really worried about you.
293	00:20:24	00:20:27	I think you should stay.
294	00:20:27	00:20:28	Yeah, I'm sure she'd be happy to see you.
295	00:20:32	00:20:34	Look, I'm sorry.
296	00:20:36	00:20:40	If I see her, then I'll tell her someone else is looking out for her.
297	00:20:42	00:20:43	Thanks.
298	00:21:10	00:21:12	Hey, Brody, I heard you're on the rape case.
299	00:21:12	00:21:14	Stealing the glory again?
300	00:21:14	00:21:16	Day shift doesn't start for another hour, Yeager.
301	00:21:16	00:21:18	Go get your breakfast buffet on. No.
302	00:21:18	00:21:20	No carbs until I make CSI-3.
303	00:21:20	00:21:22	Bumped into Sidle.
304	00:21:22	00:21:25	She looped me in on the rape investigation.
305	00:21:25	00:21:26	So, what do you have?
306	00:21:26	00:21:29	Uh, suspect tracked two different materials into the scene.
307	00:21:29	00:21:40	One was, uh, crushed shells and the other was a smog-eating concrete, and I found one location where both of these materials exist-- this trailer park. So you think the rapist may have originated from there?
308	00:21:40	00:21:44	Yeah, but it still doesn't clear our prime suspect-- victim's ex Jared Wallace.
309	00:21:44	00:21:47	Now, I thought he was some rich kid, not some trailer type.
310	00:21:47	00:21:52	Well, this particular trailer park has a lot of drug activity, and Wallace has an ecstasy charge on his record.
311	00:21:52	00:21:55	Okay, so Wallace swings by to score something before the rapes.
312	00:21:55	00:21:57	There's something else.
313	00:21:57	00:22:01	I think Dawn figured this out before I did and now she's missing.
314	00:22:01	00:22:02	Yeah, I heard-- no-show today.
315	00:22:02	00:22:04	I've worked with her.
316	00:22:04	00:22:08	That's not like Dawn. Case had her amped, so I'm thinking maybe she found the same location.
317	00:22:08	00:22:11	Could be she ran into our suspect.
318	00:22:11	00:22:14	This e-mail was the last thing up on her computer.
319	00:22:14	00:22:17	Maybe she went to follow up.
320	00:22:17	00:22:20	Went to the trailer park, and then...
321	00:22:20	00:22:23	Oh, you think something happened to her?
322	00:22:23	00:22:24	I don't know.
323	00:22:24	00:22:26	All right. I'll drive.
324	00:22:32	00:22:39	Okay, the manager did not recognize Dawn or Jared Wallace, but he said people are in and out all hours.
325	00:22:39	00:22:41	He give you a list of the residents?
326	00:22:41	00:22:42	No, he refused.
327	00:22:42	00:22:44	Suggested we move along.
328	00:22:45	00:22:46	It's okay.
329	00:22:46	00:22:48	We can do it another way.
330	00:22:50	00:22:52	You trying Dawn again?
331	00:22:52	00:22:53	Yeah.
332	00:22:56	00:22:58	Morgan.
333	00:22:59	00:23:00	Try her again.
334	00:23:13	00:23:15	Nothing here.
335	00:23:15	00:23:17	This way.
336	00:23:37	00:23:39	Where the hell is she?
337	00:23:48	00:23:50	Time for the postal mortem?
338	00:23:56	00:23:58	No I.D. from prints or DNA.
339	00:23:58	00:24:01	Well, lividity's fixed.
340	00:24:01	00:24:03	It indicates her orientation in the box.
341	00:24:03	00:24:05	She was upside down.
342	00:24:05	00:24:08	Hmm. So she was inverted during transit.
343	00:24:08	00:24:13	Well, autopsy will confirm, but I'd venture positional asphyxia was likely the cause of death.
344	00:24:13	00:24:19	Gravity causes the organs to impede the diaphragmatic movement.
345	00:24:19	00:24:24	No movement of the diaphragm, no breathing, suffocation.
346	00:24:24	00:24:27	There aren't any wounds evident on her.
347	00:24:27	00:24:30	It doesn't appear she was forced into the box.
348	00:24:30	00:24:31	That's bizarre.
349	00:24:31	00:24:32	Well, yes and no.
350	00:24:32	00:24:35	This woman was a claustrophiliac.
351	00:24:35	00:24:39	Which means that she liked to get off by getting into tight spaces.
352	00:24:39	00:24:43	The babe in the box is named Melody Davis.
353	00:24:43	00:24:47	The package was shipped from her residence across town 36 hours ago.
354	00:24:47	00:24:51	I also lifted some prints from the label.
355	00:24:51	00:24:54	Match to Zack Fisk.
356	00:24:55	00:25:03	So Fisk sealed his playmate up at her house, mailed her to his house to have a thrill? There's a catch.
357	00:25:03	00:25:07	Melody is married to a guy named Roy Davis.
358	00:25:07	00:25:11	Brass is breaking the news and bringing him in.
359	00:25:11	00:25:14	Your wife's death was accidental.
360	00:25:14	00:25:16	She got into that box voluntarily--it's part of her...
361	00:25:16	00:25:21	claustrophilia pursuits that she indulged in with her friend Zack Fisk.
362	00:25:21	00:25:23	But I suspect you knew all about this, right?
363	00:25:23	00:25:24	Yes, sir, I did.
364	00:25:24	00:25:26	I allowed it...
365	00:25:26	00:25:27	to save my marriage.
366	00:25:27	00:25:30	She said she needed her space.
367	00:25:30	00:25:32	Or... lack of space.
368	00:25:33	00:25:39	She had met a man online, but she said it wasn't sex, it was just... play.
369	00:25:39	00:25:50	And a couple of hours after your wife put herself in the box and mailed herself, I guess you got online and tracked the package on your home computer? She had told me about her shipping fantasy before.
370	00:25:50	00:25:52	But I forbid it.
371	00:25:52	00:25:54	It's far too dangerous.
372	00:25:54	00:25:57	But apparently, she hadn't heeded me.
373	00:25:57	00:26:02	You saw the package was delivered to, uh, Zack Fisk, so you went over there and confronted him, huh? No, sir.
374	00:26:02	00:26:04	That is not true.
375	00:26:04	00:26:07	Roy, what, uh, what line of work you in?
376	00:26:07	00:26:10	(laughs softly) I... work on a ranch.
377	00:26:10	00:26:11	Horses.
378	00:26:11	00:26:15	Wide-open spaces. Yeah, see, that was a trick question.
379	00:26:15	00:26:20	We found a kernel of your special blend of horse feed.
380	00:26:20	00:26:22	It was stuck to the murder weapon.
381	00:26:24	00:26:33	I mean, you gave this guy Fisk a lot of leeway with your own wife, but he had to push it, right?
382	00:26:34	00:26:39	He thought he was safe in that stupid bubble.
383	00:26:39	00:26:41	So damn smug.
384	00:26:41	00:26:44	I told you guys, that's where I drew the line.
385	00:26:44	00:26:46	If she gets hurt... She's on the ride of her life.
386	00:26:46	00:26:48	More excitement than you've ever given her.
387	00:26:48	00:26:53	And you just wait until she arrives, and I get to tear into that pretty little package.
388	00:27:01	00:27:04	It was just play, she told me.
389	00:27:04	00:27:06	I'm sorry about your wife, Roy.
390	00:27:06	00:27:13	I really am. Unfortunately, you're gonna have to share her love of enclosed spaces.
391	00:27:19	00:27:22	So, PD towed in Dawn's car.
392	00:27:22	00:27:24	Found it roadside in the middle of nowhere.
393	00:27:24	00:27:29	Searched the immediate area-- nothing unusual, and no viable prints on the outside. Get to the inside yet?
394	00:27:29	00:27:31	No, not yet.
395	00:27:31	00:27:33	All right, I'll take the front.
396	00:27:50	00:27:51	I got a receipt...
397	00:27:51	00:27:54	from a truck stop.
398	00:27:54	00:27:56	00 a.m., the night she went missing.
399	00:27:56	00:27:57	30 bucks. Does it say what she bought?
400	00:28:07	00:28:09	I've got an evidence bag.
401	00:28:09	00:28:12	That looks like a T-shirt.
402	00:28:12	00:28:14	Dawn might have gone rogue.
403	00:28:14	00:28:18	You know, stealing a DNA sample from Jared Wallace or maybe a suspect from the trailer park.
404	00:28:21	00:28:24	The guy could've caught up with her and...
405	00:28:24	00:28:25	stopped her.
406	00:28:25	00:28:27	I think the threat was closer to home.
407	00:28:29	00:28:32	Her suspect was her son.
408	00:28:43	00:28:46	Tyler, your mom's car was found abandoned on the highway.
409	00:28:46	00:28:48	She was working a serial rape case.
410	00:28:48	00:28:50	She was transporting collected evidence in her car.
411	00:28:50	00:29:00	Now, we think because of the sequence of events and the timing of everything that she identified the suspect, who tracked her to the highway location and confronted her. Where's my mom?
412	00:29:00	00:29:02	We pulled your rap sheet.
413	00:29:02	00:29:04	You're a registered sex offender.
414	00:29:04	00:29:06	Yeah, for taking a leak in an alleyway.
415	00:29:06	00:29:08	You've been convicted of burglary.
416	00:29:08	00:29:10	What does this have to do with anything?
417	00:29:10	00:29:13	The rape victim, Amy Morse, the one whose case your mom was working on, you knew her.
418	00:29:13	00:29:15	You went to Sagebrush High with her. Okay.
419	00:29:15	00:29:18	There's 2,000 kids at that school!
420	00:29:18	00:29:21	I don't know her. Your mom collected a DNA sample from the rapist.
421	00:29:21	00:29:25	She also collected a DNA sample from you.
422	00:29:25	00:29:28	Right now, the lab is comparing them.
423	00:29:30	00:29:33	Look, you got to get my mom.
424	00:29:33	00:29:34	Where is she, Tyler?
425	00:29:34	00:29:36	Where's your mom?
426	00:29:39	00:29:41	Captain. Not now, Officer.
427	00:29:41	00:29:43	A detective's come from Reno-- you've got to hear this.
428	00:29:43	00:29:45	Take him out in the hallway.
429	00:29:49	00:29:50	How you doing?
430	00:29:50	00:29:52	Jim Brass.
431	00:29:52	00:29:55	Inspector Smith. Reno PD.
432	00:29:55	00:29:57	I hear that you've been looking for CSI Dawn Banks.
433	00:29:57	00:29:59	Yeah, that's right.
434	00:29:59	00:30:01	She was supposed to be coming up our way--never showed.
435	00:30:01	00:30:03	What was she doing with Reno PD?
436	00:30:03	00:30:07	She was coming up to identify her deceased son, Tyler.
437	00:30:09	00:30:13	That's her son right there in the hallway.
438	00:30:13	00:30:16	Okay, let's step back.
439	00:30:16	00:30:18	Tell me what you know.
440	00:30:18	00:30:23	Two nights ago, Reno officers found a deceased male in a warehouse where homeless kids were known to squat.
441	00:30:23	00:30:25	Overdose. Badly decomposed.
442	00:30:25	00:30:29	Had a driver's license identifying him as Tyler Banks.
443	00:30:29	00:30:32	I called Ms. Banks to break the news.
444	00:30:32	00:30:34	She was at a trailer park working a case.
445	00:30:34	00:30:35	She was devastated.
446	00:30:35	00:30:39	Tyler...
447	00:30:39	00:30:41	Oh...
448	00:30:41	00:30:45	Said that she had always feared a call like this about her son.
449	00:30:45	00:30:52	She was gonna collect a DNA exemplar from home and drive it up, confirm I.D. She never showed.
450	00:30:52	00:30:56	So that's why Dawn Banks was taking a DNA sample of Tyler.
451	00:30:56	00:30:58	He wasn't her suspect.
452	00:30:58	00:31:00	She thought he was dead.
453	00:31:00	00:31:04	Henry ran Tyler's DNA against the rapist.
454	00:31:04	00:31:10	He's clear. Apparently, Tyler lent his I.D. to a buddy of his, a homeless guy who was heading up to Reno.
455	00:31:10	00:31:16	So his buddy O.D.'s, decomposes beyond recognition, cops go off the I.D. in his pocket.
456	00:31:16	00:31:17	All right.
457	00:31:17	00:31:18	So, let's run this.
458	00:31:18	00:31:29	You get the call that your son is dead, and you pick up a piece of his laundry for DNA so you can I.D. him. You start driving up to Reno where the body is. Right. Except...
459	00:31:29	00:31:33	the road that her car ends up on is not on the way to Reno.
460	00:31:33	00:31:40	I found a receipt in Dawn's car from a truck stop, and the truck stop...
461	00:31:40	00:31:44	is at the junction of 95 and 373.
462	00:31:44	00:31:48	That's when she started driving south, away from Reno.
463	00:31:48	00:31:51	So maybe the truck stop is where she changed her mind, and her route.
464	00:31:51	00:31:54	Where was she going?
465	00:31:56	00:32:04	Tyler, I need to ask you a question. Is there, um, any place off of Highway 373 that may have meant something to your mom?
466	00:32:04	00:32:06	Why?
467	00:32:10	00:32:12	Your mom thought you were dead.
468	00:32:12	00:32:15	Your I.D. was on a young man who overdosed in Reno.
469	00:32:15	00:32:20	She was driving out to identify your body, and, for some reason, she changed her mind.
470	00:32:20	00:32:22	She stopped at a truck stop, and, uh...
471	00:32:22	00:32:24	We pulled the surveillance footage.
472	00:32:24	00:32:25	It looks like she bought...
473	00:32:25	00:32:28	vodka and acetaminophen.
474	00:32:28	00:32:30	S-So she's... No, no, listen.
475	00:32:30	00:32:36	W-We don't know that, but we think that maybe, if she was going to do something to herself, she might have chosen a place that was significant.
476	00:32:38	00:32:41	She used to take me camping out there.
477	00:32:41	00:32:42	But, I mean, i-it was forever ago.
478	00:32:42	00:32:44	Okay, show me. Show me where.
479	00:32:50	00:32:51	Good boy.
480	00:32:51	00:32:54	This favorite spot Tyler told you about, are you sure it's this way?
481	00:32:54	00:32:56	That's what he said.
482	00:32:56	00:32:59	But he and his mom haven't been here in several years.
483	00:32:59	00:33:02	He was a little hazy. Well, if Dawn's up here, how many hours has it been? (dog barking)
484	00:33:02	00:33:05	Over there. Come on.
485	00:33:11	00:33:12	(gasps) Dawn.
486	00:33:16	00:33:18	She's got a pulse.
487	00:33:18	00:33:20	Control, this is Adam-Zero-Four Yeager.
488	00:33:20	00:33:24	We have CSI Banks. North trail, about a half-mile in.
489	00:33:24	00:33:25	Send medics. Code three.
490	00:33:25	00:33:28	Dawn? Come on.
491	00:33:28	00:33:30	(sighs) Dawn, wake up, please.
492	00:33:30	00:33:31	Tyler is alive.
493	00:33:31	00:33:33	He's okay. Come on. Stay with us, Dawn.
494	00:33:33	00:33:37	Dawn, help's on the way.
495	00:33:40	00:33:42	Hey, boss. Got your text. How's CSI Banks?
496	00:33:42	00:33:45	Oh, she's in ICU. Morgan's with her.
497	00:33:45	00:33:46	Good. Uh, what's up?
498	00:33:46	00:33:51	We still have a serial rapist out there with some kind of connection to that trailer park.
499	00:33:51	00:33:52	Right.
500	00:33:52	00:33:55	Want you to grab Henry, go out there and go through all the trash cans you can find.
501	00:33:55	00:33:59	If you come up with any biologicals, run them against our rapist's DNA.
502	00:33:59	00:34:01	We need to find out if he's still in one of those trailers.
503	00:34:01	00:34:04	All right, I'm on it. Thank you.
504	00:34:18	00:34:20	Doing noble work here, ma'am.
505	00:34:21	00:34:23	Hodges?
506	00:34:23	00:34:25	Check this out.
507	00:34:29	00:34:37	So they got top-of-the-line locks, security cam. They're treating a dinged-up trailer like it's Fort Knox.
508	00:34:37	00:34:38	Paranoid, or protecting something?
509	00:34:46	00:34:48	Couple of wadded-up tissues.
510	00:34:48	00:34:50	Ooh.
511	00:34:50	00:34:52	I know what I'm running first.
512	00:35:05	00:35:08	DNA matches our rapist.
513	00:35:08	00:35:10	We've got him.
514	00:35:12	00:35:14	LVPD!
515	00:35:19	00:35:21	All clear.
516	00:35:21	00:35:23	Come on, Henry.
517	00:35:27	00:35:29	Surveillance cam's not hooked up.
518	00:35:29	00:35:32	It's just for show.
519	00:35:35	00:35:38	Young brunettes.
520	00:35:38	00:35:40	Just like Amy and the other victims.
521	00:35:40	00:35:46	I got pics of Amy with Jared Wallace, and, uh, other mementos.
522	00:35:49	00:35:54	Jared, I hope what we have will last forever. Amy.
523	00:35:54	00:35:56	Certainly lasted in his mind.
524	00:35:59	00:36:04	Guy rents this trailer to obsess and prepare in private.
525	00:36:04	00:36:09	Becomes his base when he starts to act out on his obsession.
526	00:36:10	00:36:12	Did some acting here, too.
527	00:36:12	00:36:13	I'll swab.
528	00:36:25	00:36:26	Heart medication.
529	00:36:26	00:36:29	Swiped Daddy's prescription.
530	00:36:34	00:36:36	A gray hair.
531	00:36:43	00:36:45	It's not Jared.
532	00:36:48	00:36:51	It's Dad.
533	00:36:51	00:36:55	I guess I can understand, Mr. Wallace.
534	00:36:55	00:36:57	This whole event started innocently at first.
535	00:36:57	00:37:00	You know, son brings home his girlfriend to meet Dad.
536	00:37:00	00:37:01	She's attractive.
537	00:37:01	00:37:03	Dad likes her. He notices her.
538	00:37:03	00:37:11	He liked having Amy around, so he invites her to family picnics, outings, but then things get weird.
539	00:37:11	00:37:13	Dad gets kind of jealous of son.
540	00:37:13	00:37:14	Right? You also took from him, too.
541	00:37:14	00:37:17	You took his jacket, his love letters.
542	00:37:17	00:37:18	And you took from Amy, too.
543	00:37:20	00:37:22	You know, we asked Amy about you.
544	00:37:22	00:37:25	What did she say?
545	00:37:25	00:37:33	She said, Ken Wallace walked in on me once or twice in the shower, but it was innocent.
546	00:37:33	00:37:36	He was sweet, clumsy, older man.
547	00:37:36	00:37:38	Nothing sexual about him.
548	00:37:38	00:37:48	So you had to change that, so, when Amy broke up with Jared, about a week later, you know, and you're gonna lose her, too, you decided to do something about it.
549	00:37:48	00:37:51	Get a funky old trailer, hired some brunette hookers.
550	00:37:51	00:37:54	Got their DNA from the sheets.
551	00:37:54	00:37:57	But you stepped over the line.
552	00:37:57	00:38:01	You started to prowl around condos just like Amy's.
553	00:38:01	00:38:04	Started to stalk young women, brunettes, just like Amy.
554	00:38:04	00:38:06	You broke into their house.
555	00:38:06	00:38:14	You broke into their bedroom to act out your sick rape fantasies, all in preparation...
556	00:38:14	00:38:16	for Amy.
557	00:38:18	00:38:20	Amy was worth it.
558	00:38:22	00:38:26	The woman... is a miracle.
559	00:38:28	00:38:29	Jared had her, he messed it up.
560	00:38:32	00:38:35	When I had my chance with her...
561	00:38:35	00:38:38	I made it perfect.
562	00:38:55	00:38:59	Doctors say your mom's gonna pull through.
563	00:38:59	00:39:02	I never wanted to hurt her.
564	00:39:02	00:39:04	I know.
565	00:39:04	00:39:07	Or make it easy for her to believe I'd end up dead that way.
566	00:39:18	00:39:23	You know, I-I just keep thinking about how cold she was out there.
567	00:39:23	00:39:28	You know, I could've told her, sleeping outside sucks.
568	00:39:33	00:39:36	She's going to need you, Tyler, more than ever.
569	00:39:40	00:39:45	I swear to God, I'm not leaving the house for a second.
570	00:39:45	00:39:47	I'm done...
571	00:39:47	00:39:50	with everything, everyone else.
572	00:39:50	00:39:53	Just let her be okay.
573	00:39:56	00:39:59	Please let her be okay.
