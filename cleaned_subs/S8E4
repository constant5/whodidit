0	00:01:08	00:01:10	Guy in a boat spotted him this morning.
1	00:01:10	00:01:11	No witnesses.
2	00:01:11	00:01:13	How did he get up there?
3	00:01:16	00:01:18	I think maybe somebody gave him a lift.
4	00:01:18	00:01:20	Okay, Super, I'm ready to cut.
5	00:01:27	00:01:30	Lacerations to his chest.
6	00:01:31	00:01:33	Stabbed and then hanged.
7	00:01:33	00:01:36	I guess he wasn't dead enough.
8	00:01:36	00:01:40	Rope burns on both palms.
9	00:01:40	00:01:41	He probably tried to pull himself up.
10	00:01:41	00:01:43	Lift his shirt up, will you, David?
11	00:01:45	00:01:47	Whoa!
12	00:01:47	00:01:51	I... thought this... guy was a guy.
13	00:01:51	00:01:52	Check the plumping.
14	00:01:53	00:01:54	Full male genitalia.
15	00:01:54	00:01:58	Mutilated tranny strung up in a tree.
16	00:02:02	00:02:03	Go! Go! Go! Go!
17	00:02:03	00:02:06	Bet I know how he got up there.
18	00:02:13	00:02:16	and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
19	00:03:39	00:03:42	Lacerations aren't deep enough to have killed him.
20	00:03:42	00:03:46	Ligature furrows canted upward.
21	00:03:46	00:03:49	Scratches... consistent with struggling to get free.
22	00:03:50	00:03:52	Preliminary C.O.D.'s suffocation from hanging.
23	00:03:53	00:03:55	18 years old.
24	00:03:56	00:03:58	Brian Towne.
25	00:03:58	00:04:00	Lived in Verdant Glen.
26	00:04:00	00:04:06	Hmm. 20 years ago, my wife wanted to buy out there, but there was no 215 freeway back then.
27	00:04:06	00:04:07	The commute would've killed me.
28	00:04:07	00:04:10	No physical signs of Klinefelter syndrome.
29	00:04:10	00:04:12	So he's not an XXY.
30	00:04:12	00:04:15	No, he's all skin and muscle.
31	00:04:15	00:04:16	These can't be fatty deposits...
32	00:04:17	00:04:19	This is glandular tissue.
33	00:04:19	00:04:22	His mammaries are swollen.
34	00:04:22	00:04:23	Gynecomastia.
35	00:04:23	00:04:26	Pre-op transsexuals take a lot of estrogen.
36	00:04:26	00:04:31	I'll run an expanded tox panel, send out for a hormone screen.
37	00:04:37	00:04:39	It wasn't easy being a Copa girl.
38	00:04:39	00:04:45	When the curtain came down, we had to stay and decorate the Sands Casino into the wee hours.
39	00:04:45	00:04:49	Ugly guys do gamble more when there's pretty girls to look at.
40	00:04:49	00:04:51	They weren't all ugly.
41	00:04:51	00:04:55	And your father, in that tuxedo...
42	00:04:55	00:05:02	giving me the eye, trying not to grin, 'cause he thought floor managers had to be tough.
43	00:05:02	00:05:03	So, Mom, who made the first move?
44	00:05:03	00:05:06	Sam.
45	00:05:06	00:05:13	Stuck this five-dollar chip in my hand and said, Take it, you can't miss.
46	00:05:13	00:05:16	I shot craps all night with Peter Lawford and cleaned up.
47	00:05:18	00:05:24	I was right here the day Sam opened the Rampart, his first casino.
48	00:05:26	00:05:30	And we were going to be right here again when he opened the Eclipse.
49	00:05:30	00:05:37	I know you wanted to be buried with this, but I just couldn't let go.
50	00:05:37	00:05:39	I can now.
51	00:05:40	00:05:44	They're going to build your dream on it, honey.
52	00:05:46	00:05:48	Take it.
53	00:05:49	00:05:50	You can't miss.
54	00:06:16	00:06:18	I don't care if it's Jimmy Louise Hoffa.
55	00:06:18	00:06:20	I want you to grab that jackhammer and bust up this concrete.
56	00:06:20	00:06:21	Supervisor Willows from Crime Lab.
57	00:06:21	00:06:23	What's going on here? Worker found a body.
58	00:06:23	00:06:24	I'm just following protocol.
59	00:06:24	00:06:27	You find a body, call you guys.
60	00:06:27	00:06:30	Yeah. How do you know this is one of the Marquis Chimps?
61	00:06:30	00:06:34	'Cause they played the Frontier in Ronald Reagan's act.
62	00:06:34	00:06:38	And only humans have a saddle joint.
63	00:06:38	00:06:42	In fact, that's how we were able to swing out of trees and end up here.
64	00:06:42	00:06:43	Opposable thumbs.
65	00:06:43	00:06:46	Well, these casinos weren't built by saints, you know.
66	00:06:46	00:06:48	Oh, I know.
67	00:06:48	00:06:49	My dad built this one.
68	00:06:51	00:06:52	Las Vegas Crime Lab.
69	00:06:52	00:06:54	Yeah, this is CSI Willows.
70	00:06:54	00:06:58	I need to hand a case off to Swing.
71	00:06:58	00:06:59	Conflict of interest.
72	00:07:51	00:07:53	I want to know who did this.
73	00:07:53	00:07:56	Well, that's what we're trying to find out.
74	00:07:56	00:08:01	Mrs. Towne, it would be of help if you could tell me a little bit more about your son Brian.
75	00:08:02	00:08:11	He was kind... and sweet and... didn't have an enemy in the world.
76	00:08:11	00:08:13	What about friends? Not really.
77	00:08:13	00:08:18	He was always so busy putting in overtime down at the... water treatment plant.
78	00:08:20	00:08:22	He loved to take long runs.
79	00:08:22	00:08:25	Exercise is a natural cure for depression.
80	00:08:25	00:08:27	Was he depressed?
81	00:08:27	00:08:28	I mean, there's a lot of medications here.
82	00:08:29	00:08:30	Are these Brian's?
83	00:08:30	00:08:31	No. These are all mine.
84	00:08:31	00:08:35	I had a mastectomy eight years ago.
85	00:08:35	00:08:37	Cancer came back three months ago.
86	00:08:37	00:08:38	Oh.
87	00:08:38	00:08:40	I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.
88	00:08:40	00:08:43	I never thought I'd outlive my son.
89	00:08:45	00:08:48	Is there anything else?
90	00:08:48	00:08:50	Did you know a person with the last name Cyden?
91	00:08:50	00:08:52	C-Y-D-E-N? Paul Cyden.
92	00:08:52	00:08:55	He's a family friend; he lives a couple blocks over.
93	00:08:55	00:08:57	So Brian knew him, too?
94	00:08:57	00:09:01	Oh, he was like a father to Brian after my husband died.
95	00:09:01	00:09:03	Why are you asking about Paul?
96	00:09:03	00:09:07	Ma'am, your son had a good deal of cash stashed away in his bedroom.
97	00:09:07	00:09:09	Was he saving up for something?
98	00:09:11	00:09:12	I don't know.
99	00:09:14	00:09:17	What's going on here?
100	00:09:17	00:09:21	Mrs. Towne, we think Brian was saving up for a sex change operation.
101	00:09:21	00:09:22	Were you aware of this?
102	00:09:23	00:09:25	My son was not a freak.
103	00:09:25	00:09:27	No, I didn't say that.
104	00:09:27	00:09:29	Ma'am, we're not trying to upset you in any way.
105	00:09:29	00:09:31	I volunteered to let you in my house!
106	00:09:31	00:09:33	And now I want you to leave. I want you to leave right now!
107	00:09:43	00:09:48	In college, I wanted to be an archeologist, until I did a summer on a dig in Tunisia.
108	00:09:48	00:09:51	Hot. But that got me into Forensics.
109	00:09:51	00:09:53	What made you pick Vegas?
110	00:09:53	00:09:55	Well, it, uh, it kind of picked me.
111	00:10:00	00:10:02	Hey, check this out.
112	00:10:08	00:10:10	Turquoise and silver beads.
113	00:10:10	00:10:12	I got the matching necklace at the Indian market in Santa Fe.
114	00:10:12	00:10:14	Everybody stop!
115	00:10:14	00:10:16	Stop what you're doing!
116	00:10:17	00:10:21	What is the problem now? We have just found evidence that this might be a Native American burial site.
117	00:10:21	00:10:23	We have to notify the Inter-Tribal Council.
118	00:10:23	00:10:25	Until they say so, nobody touches anything.
119	00:10:26	00:10:27	Hey, Grissom.
120	00:10:27	00:10:28	About your hanging victim.
121	00:10:29	00:10:30	The one with the chesticals.
122	00:10:30	00:10:32	The man boobs...
123	00:10:32	00:10:34	Uh, the... gynecomastia, sorry.
124	00:10:34	00:10:36	Quant hormone report.
125	00:10:36	00:10:38	Androgen's low. Estradiol's high.
126	00:10:38	00:10:40	It's 250 picograms per milliliter.
127	00:10:40	00:10:42	Arogesterone, too.
128	00:10:42	00:10:45	Estrogen level is five times the normal amount for an adult male.
129	00:10:45	00:10:47	It's consistent with a pre-op transsexual.
130	00:10:47	00:10:51	Yeah, but there's no other pre-op drugs in his system.
131	00:10:51	00:10:56	No spironolactone, no flutamide, progesterone.
132	00:10:56	00:10:59	Maybe he's a do-it-yourselfer.
133	00:10:59	00:11:00	Okay.
134	00:11:07	00:11:07	Hello?
135	00:11:08	00:11:09	Paul Cyden? This is he.
136	00:11:13	00:11:14	Paul Cyden.
137	00:11:14	00:11:20	I'm Detective Jim Brass, this is Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab. I'd like to ask you a couple questions about Brian Towne.
138	00:11:20	00:11:23	What a great kid.
139	00:11:23	00:11:24	I can't believe he's gone.
140	00:11:24	00:11:26	When was the last time you talked with him?
141	00:11:26	00:11:28	Oh, uh, honestly, I don't remember.
142	00:11:29	00:11:30	Oh, you don't remember yesterday?
143	00:11:30	00:11:31	Calling him? Texting him?
144	00:11:32	00:11:35	Brian occasionally does odd jobs for me.
145	00:11:35	00:11:37	How odd?
146	00:11:38	00:11:39	I, uh, study water.
147	00:11:39	00:11:43	I'm a hydrologist, retired, but I still do consulting.
148	00:11:43	00:11:46	Brian was helping me with a project.
149	00:11:46	00:11:49	Well, it seems to me, according to your messages, Brian was the project.
150	00:11:49	00:11:52	You're way off base.
151	00:11:52	00:11:54	Then you won't mind giving us your fingerprints and DNA?
152	00:11:54	00:11:57	Not if you have a court order. (cell phone ringing)
153	00:11:57	00:12:00	Look, you can do this the hard way or the easy way.
154	00:12:00	00:12:02	But trust me, we're going to get this done.
155	00:12:02	00:12:04	Yeah, what's up, Doc?
156	00:12:04	00:12:06	Yeah, Brian Towne's mother is here.
157	00:12:06	00:12:08	She wants to see the body.
158	00:12:08	00:12:11	Okay. If anything of interest pops up, why don't you text me?
159	00:12:11	00:12:13	All right.
160	00:12:33	00:12:35	He needed a haircut.
161	00:13:11	00:13:14	Are you lurking around here for results?
162	00:13:14	00:13:16	No. No, no. I wouldn't do that.
163	00:13:16	00:13:18	I was just, uh... I was getting a cup of coffee.
164	00:13:18	00:13:21	Actually. You can come in.
165	00:13:21	00:13:22	Why, do you got something?
166	00:13:22	00:13:23	I do. I got a two-fer.
167	00:13:23	00:13:27	I got epithelials from the rope from multiple contributors, and one of them...
168	00:13:27	00:13:28	drank from the bloody beer bottle.
169	00:13:28	00:13:31	Larry Ludwig.
170	00:13:31	00:13:35	Convicted of aggravated assault and DUI.
171	00:13:35	00:13:37	Bring up his parole record. Okay.
172	00:13:38	00:13:40	There you go.
173	00:13:40	00:13:44	He works at the same water treatment plant as my victim.
174	00:13:44	00:13:46	Thought you were getting coffee.
175	00:13:46	00:13:49	Right.
176	00:13:51	00:13:53	You sure you fellas don't want masks?
177	00:13:53	00:13:55	The smell in here makes some people puke.
178	00:13:55	00:13:58	Mr. Ludwig, can we see your palms, please?
179	00:13:58	00:14:01	What, you gonna tell me my future or something?
180	00:14:01	00:14:03	Depends on what I see.
181	00:14:03	00:14:04	I don't think so.
182	00:14:04	00:14:07	Gentlemen?
183	00:14:07	00:14:10	Hey, I was just getting back to work, Mr. Quinn. Jonah Quinn.
184	00:14:10	00:14:11	General Manager. I'm Warrick Brown.
185	00:14:11	00:14:14	And I'm Nick Stokes, we're with the Vegas Crime Lab.
186	00:14:14	00:14:17	We're here investigating the death of one of your employees, Brian Towne.
187	00:14:17	00:14:19	I told them I had nothing to say, sir.
188	00:14:19	00:14:23	You have my permission to question and search any of my employees.
189	00:14:23	00:14:25	They don't have warrant, Mr. Quinn.
190	00:14:25	00:14:27	They're just... they're just fishing around, sir.
191	00:14:27	00:14:36	Anybody who doesn't want to cooperate with the police in trying to find out who killed Brian can clean out their lockers and search for another job!
192	00:14:36	00:14:40	Weren't they asking you a question?
193	00:14:40	00:14:41	Go ahead and take off your gloves.
194	00:14:41	00:14:44	Show us your palms.
195	00:14:49	00:14:53	Well, now, they look like rope burns.
196	00:14:55	00:14:58	Did you know that there's a Paiute reservation in the heart of Las Vegas?
197	00:14:58	00:15:01	It's only an acre, but it's right up on North Main.
198	00:15:01	00:15:05	Do you think that we found the bones of one of their ancestors?
199	00:15:05	00:15:10	Well, the fusing of the plates and shape of the skull indicate a 30-year-old of the Mongoloid race.
200	00:15:10	00:15:12	Which does include Native Americans.
201	00:15:12	00:15:14	And Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders.
202	00:15:14	00:15:16	But take a look at the teeth.
203	00:15:19	00:15:23	I don't see any dental work.
204	00:15:23	00:15:24	But there are caries.
205	00:15:24	00:15:26	Cavities. Right.
206	00:15:26	00:15:35	Teeth from ancient tribal graves usually have distinctive wear marks, uh, grooves from pipe- smoking, rope-making-- but no cavities.
207	00:15:36	00:15:37	You look disappointed.
208	00:15:37	00:15:43	I was... hoping, just once, Vegas would have to honor its past.
209	00:15:43	00:15:50	These tire treads were under a tree where Brian's body was found.
210	00:15:50	00:15:52	They're from a Chevy Colorado.
211	00:15:52	00:15:54	Isn't that what you drive?
212	00:15:54	00:15:55	Yeah.
213	00:15:57	00:15:59	You're putting a nice polish on that wedding band.
214	00:15:59	00:16:03	Hey, this is between us, right?
215	00:16:03	00:16:06	Yeah, absolutely. Oh, yeah.
216	00:16:06	00:16:10	All right... I did see Brian last night.
217	00:16:10	00:16:15	Me and my buddy, we started out at a bar, threw a few back, you know, met some ladies.
218	00:16:15	00:16:18	And the hot one, she said, Let's go swimming.
219	00:16:25	00:16:26	Brian. What's shaking?
220	00:16:26	00:16:27	Not much.
221	00:16:28	00:16:29	Anybody want one?
222	00:16:29	00:16:31	Yes, please.
223	00:16:31	00:16:40	So the girls, they wanted to play Tarzan, so I pull my pickup truck underneath the tree, I grabbed a rope out of my utility box, and we all started stripping down and everything...
224	00:16:42	00:16:45	Whoo!
225	00:16:45	00:16:47	Come on, it's fun!
226	00:16:55	00:16:57	Oh, my God.
227	00:16:57	00:16:59	What?
228	00:17:03	00:17:04	I mean, the guy had boobs, man.
229	00:17:04	00:17:06	I mean, you could see 'em right through the T-shirt.
230	00:17:08	00:17:14	I mean, we were all kind of cracking up about it, but um... uh...
231	00:17:14	00:17:16	it kind of broke the party up a little bit.
232	00:17:16	00:17:21	No, you kind of broke up the party, man, when you cut him up with a beer bottle and you hanged him in a tree.
233	00:17:21	00:17:24	Hey, man, I mean... he ran off and we left.
234	00:17:24	00:17:27	All right, I-I-I don't know what else I can tell you.
235	00:17:27	00:17:30	I mean, you can ask Tony-- he works with me, too.
236	00:17:30	00:17:31	Where did you go?
237	00:17:31	00:17:32	I went to the...
238	00:17:32	00:17:34	I went to a motel with one of, one of the girls.
239	00:17:34	00:17:37	These girls have names?
240	00:17:37	00:17:39	Yeah, mine was, uh...
241	00:17:39	00:17:41	She was named after some city in Texas.
242	00:17:41	00:17:42	I don't know, like, uh...
243	00:17:42	00:17:44	Dallas or Houston or something like that.
244	00:17:44	00:17:48	The other one, she really wasn't that hot, so I don't know what her name was.
245	00:17:48	00:17:49	You better hope we find these girls.
246	00:17:49	00:17:53	We better not find any of Brian's blood in your flatbed.
247	00:18:06	00:18:08	Wow!
248	00:18:08	00:18:11	The original plans for the Rampart.
249	00:18:11	00:18:13	Opening day, New Year's Eve, 1964.
250	00:18:13	00:18:18	Half of the hotel tower was still under construction, but Sam decided to have the party anyway.
251	00:18:18	00:18:22	He's got the Midas touch, and help from the boys in Kansas City.
252	00:18:22	00:18:25	This is the ultimate.
253	00:18:25	00:18:28	Don't you have work to do?
254	00:18:28	00:18:29	Deal me in.
255	00:18:29	00:18:32	Well...
256	00:18:32	00:18:34	the workers found the bones here...
257	00:18:34	00:18:38	which corresponds to this area.
258	00:18:38	00:18:41	Bottom of the construction shaft.
259	00:18:41	00:18:43	Wonder if it's Gus the Beauty Finkel.
260	00:18:43	00:18:45	Snitch, disappeared in '64.
261	00:18:45	00:18:47	The skull shape is Mongoloid.
262	00:18:48	00:18:51	Maybe it's Eddie Chang, the Peking Pimp.
263	00:18:51	00:18:54	Caught Dean at the Sands, went out for eggs, never came back.
264	00:18:55	00:18:59	Did the Peking Pimp ever wear anything like this on his arm?
265	00:18:59	00:19:02	Nope. Just French cuffs and platinum blondes.
266	00:19:03	00:19:05	Careful with those.
267	00:19:05	00:19:07	They're like the Dead Sea Scrolls of Las Vegas.
268	00:19:07	00:19:09	I have to go back to the scene.
269	00:19:09	00:19:10	I'm off the clock.
270	00:19:10	00:19:12	You, uh, need a hand?
271	00:19:22	00:19:24	67.5 inches.
272	00:19:25	00:19:26	Not the Peking Pimp.
273	00:19:26	00:19:28	He was only five-two.
274	00:19:28	00:19:31	It looks like every bone in his body is broken.
275	00:19:35	00:19:39	Check out the third vertebrosternal rib, left side.
276	00:19:39	00:19:40	Isn't that a bullet hole? Exit wound.
277	00:19:41	00:19:42	Good call. Document it.
278	00:19:42	00:19:48	Nothing says Mob hit like shot in the chest, thrown down a construction shaft, and tucked in under a concrete blanket.
279	00:19:48	00:19:50	For real?
280	00:19:50	00:19:52	My first Mob hit.
281	00:19:52	00:19:56	Cool. You know, only the bones at the point of impact should be broken.
282	00:19:56	00:20:00	Then the implosion must have busted up the rest of him.
283	00:20:03	00:20:05	Hey, Ronnie?
284	00:20:05	00:20:06	Will you take a picture of this for me, please?
285	00:20:06	00:20:08	Yeah.
286	00:20:11	00:20:14	It looks like... treated hide.
287	00:20:15	00:20:17	Buckskin.
288	00:20:17	00:20:19	Maybe your M.E. was wrong.
289	00:20:19	00:20:21	Well, only if the ancient tribes used sewing machines.
290	00:20:21	00:20:22	The stitches are uniform.
291	00:20:22	00:20:30	You know, the showroom had this Wild West Revue with cowboys, and horses, and rifles, a real stagecoach.
292	00:20:30	00:20:33	And Indians who shot flaming arrows that ripped off the dance hall girls' clothes.
293	00:20:33	00:20:38	It ran from the day the Rampart opened until 1976.
294	00:20:38	00:20:41	An Indian playing an Indian?
295	00:20:45	00:20:51	When I was growing up, there weren't any lakes in Vegas, just hotel swimming pools.
296	00:20:53	00:20:56	I think Mr. Cyden might be dodging us.
297	00:20:58	00:21:00	Call in a 419.
298	00:21:06	00:21:08	So you think that's a message or his dinner?
299	00:21:08	00:21:10	Well, that's carp.
300	00:21:10	00:21:11	Nobody really eats those.
301	00:21:11	00:21:13	Body's in full rigor.
302	00:21:13	00:21:14	Been dead at least ten hours.
303	00:21:14	00:21:16	Appears to be...
304	00:21:16	00:21:18	one, two, three gunshot wounds to the torso.
305	00:21:19	00:21:21	Probably rules out suicide.
306	00:21:22	00:21:23	No exit wounds.
307	00:21:23	00:21:27	I don't see a gun or cartridge casings anywhere.
308	00:21:27	00:21:30	He has some fairly dense gunshot residue patterns.
309	00:21:30	00:21:33	Shooter was only a couple of feet away, practically face-to-face.
310	00:21:33	00:21:35	No signs of forced entry, no signs of struggle.
311	00:21:35	00:21:37	I bet he knew his killer.
312	00:21:37	00:21:41	Maybe the same person who killed the tranny killed the boyfriend.
313	00:21:47	00:21:51	Offer to buy his house dated... yesterday.
314	00:21:51	00:21:56	Who tears up an offer in this tough market?
315	00:21:56	00:21:59	Jonah Quinn.
316	00:21:59	00:22:00	That's Brian's boss.
317	00:22:00	00:22:02	I met him.
318	00:22:02	00:22:05	This notebook charts hormone levels.
319	00:22:05	00:22:08	No names, just numbers.
320	00:22:08	00:22:11	There's over 40 test subjects here.
321	00:22:11	00:22:16	If this guy was running some kind of underground clinic here, then where are the drugs?
322	00:22:16	00:22:19	These could be hormones.
323	00:22:19	00:22:22	Warrick found vials like that in Brian's bedroom.
324	00:22:22	00:22:24	Check that freezer.
325	00:22:27	00:22:28	Carpe diem.
326	00:22:29	00:22:30	Lots of them.
327	00:22:31	00:22:34	Numbered and dated.
328	00:22:34	00:22:35	Shoot me a number.
329	00:22:35	00:22:43	R-41 June 20, 2007.
330	00:22:43	00:22:45	Why would he be giving hormones to fish?
331	00:22:50	00:22:52	Hodges?
332	00:22:52	00:22:54	Here's the problem...
333	00:22:54	00:22:58	You know, that's just what Mom says when all I ask is to come home for Thanksgiving.
334	00:22:58	00:23:01	My John Doe is from 1964.
335	00:23:01	00:23:04	Well, to quote Sherlock Sanders, This town was built on dead bodies.
336	00:23:04	00:23:09	The National Missing Persons Database only lists four persons in '64, none of which are a match.
337	00:23:09	00:23:12	It might help if we knew where he was from.
338	00:23:12	00:23:13	Do I look like the Ghost Whisperer?
339	00:23:13	00:23:19	Every geographic area has specific levels of oxygen isotopes due to rainfall, climate and vegetation.
340	00:23:19	00:23:22	And you can identify those isotopes in bones.
341	00:23:22	00:23:27	You do know that those isotopes will only tell you where he spent the last three years or so of his life.
342	00:23:31	00:23:32	I'll take it.
343	00:23:32	00:23:34	It's more then we have now.
344	00:23:36	00:23:41	If this works, I write the paper for the Forensics Journal, sole credit.
345	00:23:41	00:23:43	Deal.
346	00:23:46	00:23:48	Me and my big mouth.
347	00:25:11	00:25:15	Sara told me to document the detritus, but I see you beat me to it.
348	00:25:15	00:25:19	Oh, sorry, yeah, I kind of got carried away, but look at this-- it's the vic's right hand.
349	00:25:21	00:25:27	He was holding on to something and when they poured the concrete on top of him, it made kind of a fossil.
350	00:25:27	00:25:29	Whatever it was, we must have collected it, right?
351	00:25:29	00:25:30	It's definitely not a gun.
352	00:25:30	00:25:33	No, you didn't find one of those.
353	00:25:37	00:25:39	Cigarette lighter?
354	00:25:41	00:25:43	No.
355	00:25:49	00:25:51	Hey.
356	00:25:55	00:25:56	It's film.
357	00:25:56	00:26:01	Uh, 35 millimeters used to come in a screw-top metal can like this.
358	00:26:01	00:26:09	Whatever's on it must be important enough for Mr. Bones to hang on to it while taking a header.
359	00:26:09	00:26:10	Later.
360	00:26:10	00:26:13	Black and white Tri-X stock.
361	00:26:13	00:26:15	It's pretty grainy.
362	00:26:15	00:26:17	Photographers like it 'cause you can shoot fast.
363	00:26:17	00:26:21	It's like finding pictures of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre.
364	00:26:24	00:26:27	The party was on the rooftop.
365	00:26:30	00:26:32	Bring up that last shot on the roll.
366	00:26:33	00:26:35	Hmm.
367	00:26:35	00:26:38	Let's see if we can take a better look at that. (typing)
368	00:26:39	00:26:42	Looks like the casino take on opening day.
369	00:26:42	00:26:48	Everybody got a cut-- the feds, the state-- and something called Fergus.
370	00:26:52	00:26:55	I love it when you dress up.
371	00:26:56	00:27:00	Well, you know, whatever it takes to get some time with you.
372	00:27:01	00:27:02	How's the study going?
373	00:27:02	00:27:04	Any sign of Colony Collapse Disorder?
374	00:27:04	00:27:06	Nope, so far it's healthy.
375	00:27:06	00:27:08	Nothing too healthy about smoking.
376	00:27:08	00:27:11	(coughs) Well, the scent confuses the guard bees.
377	00:27:11	00:27:16	They won't emit the pheromone that tells the colony there's an intruder.
378	00:27:16	00:27:18	Don't worry, he's harmless.
379	00:27:23	00:27:24	Who's who?
380	00:27:24	00:27:28	These are the workers-- infertile females.
381	00:27:28	00:27:29	They don't sting?
382	00:27:29	00:27:33	No, not unless you swat one, or close one up in your hand, or freak out.
383	00:27:33	00:27:35	Go ahead, take off your glove.
384	00:27:35	00:27:38	Eh... all right, I trust you.
385	00:27:41	00:27:43	See?
386	00:27:43	00:27:45	It's cool.
387	00:27:46	00:27:55	The worker bees defend the hive, procure the pollen, make the honey, nurture the larvae and pupae in each of these brood cells.
388	00:28:00	00:28:02	You know, maybe we should get married.
389	00:28:04	00:28:07	Ouch!
390	00:28:07	00:28:08	Oh, oh... Ow.
391	00:28:08	00:28:09	I'm sorry. Ow.
392	00:28:10	00:28:13	No, no, don't, don't, don't pick it out.
393	00:28:13	00:28:17	Makes it worse, releases the venom into the bloodstream.
394	00:28:17	00:28:19	It's better to scrape it.
395	00:28:26	00:28:30	So, uh... what do you think, you know, about...
396	00:28:30	00:28:33	Yes.
397	00:28:35	00:28:36	Let's do it.
398	00:28:36	00:28:38	Yeah?
399	00:28:53	00:28:55	Hi, Sara.
400	00:28:55	00:28:57	You look like you're having a good day.
401	00:28:57	00:28:58	Thanks.
402	00:28:58	00:28:59	Got your isotope results.
403	00:29:02	00:29:05	My John Doe lived in Southeast Asia?
404	00:29:05	00:29:08	Yeah, uh, more specifically, southern Vietnam.
405	00:29:08	00:29:12	Like I said, this test only dates back to the last three years of his life.
406	00:29:12	00:29:16	In '64... soldier?
407	00:29:16	00:29:18	Consultant, refugee?
408	00:29:19	00:29:20	Thanks. Hm.
409	00:29:20	00:29:21	Let me know if you get an I.D.
410	00:29:21	00:29:24	It'd be a great touch for the article.
411	00:29:28	00:29:29	Hey, what are you up to?
412	00:29:29	00:29:31	Nothing.
413	00:29:31	00:29:32	Why?
414	00:29:36	00:29:38	What's in the cooler?
415	00:29:39	00:29:41	Carp.
416	00:29:42	00:29:45	Paul Cyden died holding one.
417	00:29:45	00:29:47	He had a freezer full of them, some kind of an experiment.
418	00:29:47	00:29:50	Huh.
419	00:29:50	00:29:53	I can process those fish if you like.
420	00:29:53	00:29:55	Do I know how to turn you on or what?
421	00:30:02	00:30:04	Hey.
422	00:30:04	00:30:05	Heard you were looking for me.
423	00:30:05	00:30:09	Yeah, our friend Larry Ludwig-- he's sharp as a marble, but his alibi checked out.
424	00:30:09	00:30:11	We found the motel and the girl.
425	00:30:11	00:30:13	Really?
426	00:30:13	00:30:14	What's her name?
427	00:30:14	00:30:15	Tucson.
428	00:30:16	00:30:16	Ah, yes.
429	00:30:17	00:30:19	Tucson, the capital of Texas.
430	00:30:22	00:30:26	Well, Paul Cyden's DNA and fingerprints finally arrived.
431	00:30:26	00:30:27	Well, I'll run it, but I don't think it'll matter.
432	00:30:28	00:30:29	I think Brian killed himself.
433	00:30:29	00:30:33	You think he just climbed that big ol' tree all by himself?
434	00:30:33	00:30:34	Yeah.
435	00:30:34	00:30:36	Okay, yeah.
436	00:30:36	00:30:38	What about the mutilation?
437	00:30:38	00:30:39	Self-inflicted.
438	00:30:39	00:30:44	It took a while, but Mandy was able to recover some prints from the beer bottle, but it came back to Brian.
439	00:31:11	00:31:13	So this was a hate crime.
440	00:31:13	00:31:14	Yeah.
441	00:31:14	00:31:17	He hated himself.
442	00:31:29	00:31:31	Yes?
443	00:31:31	00:31:36	Oh, sorry, just a bad habit from when we worked the Miniature case together.
444	00:31:36	00:31:37	That was fun, wasn't it?
445	00:31:37	00:31:39	I thought so.
446	00:31:39	00:31:41	What do you see?
447	00:31:43	00:31:46	Well, those are eggs-- it's a girl.
448	00:31:48	00:31:51	And those white organs would be gonads.
449	00:31:52	00:31:54	Male and female parts.
450	00:31:54	00:31:55	Simultaneous hermaphroditism?
451	00:31:55	00:31:59	Stop me if you already know this, but some fish do change sex naturally.
452	00:31:59	00:32:01	Not carp.
453	00:32:01	00:32:06	I heard of a study when I was attending a forensics consortium in D.C.
454	00:32:06	00:32:10	Feminized male bass were found in the wastewater effluent of the Potomac River.
455	00:32:13	00:32:14	It's the water.
456	00:32:15	00:32:21	Yeah, it was full of excreted pharmaceuticals and what they called personal care products, all of which supposedly altered the endocrine system of the fish and their young.
457	00:32:21	00:32:25	Good, Hodges.
458	00:32:25	00:32:27	Well, now that we're working together again...
459	00:32:30	00:32:34	...take at least two organ samples along with blood.
460	00:32:34	00:32:40	Send them with these water samples to our clinical lab for hormone quants.
461	00:32:40	00:32:42	You got it, partner.
462	00:32:46	00:32:48	Melvin Fergus.
463	00:32:48	00:32:50	He was a gaming commissioner.
464	00:32:50	00:32:52	Honest Melvin.
465	00:32:52	00:32:55	Well, it looks like Honest Melvin was on the take.
466	00:32:55	00:32:57	Bribing a public official could cost you your gaming license.
467	00:32:58	00:33:03	Maybe our dead guy found out about it and somebody found out about him finding out about it.
468	00:33:03	00:33:05	Who was this dead guy?
469	00:33:05	00:33:07	Some wisenheimer with extortion on the brain.
470	00:33:07	00:33:09	Maybe a reporter.
471	00:33:09	00:33:10	Hi, Lily.
472	00:33:10	00:33:12	Hi.
473	00:33:12	00:33:13	Uh, Wendy ran that tooth.
474	00:33:13	00:33:20	Pre-CODIS, but DNA confirms that our John Doe was Native American, so it was one Indian's burial ground.
475	00:33:20	00:33:24	There was a reporter and I'm pretty sure he was an Indian.
476	00:33:25	00:33:28	Lee George.
477	00:33:28	00:33:34	He'd just come back from Vietnam for Life magazine and he was doing a piece on Vegas.
478	00:33:34	00:33:36	Do you remember if he was at the party?
479	00:33:36	00:33:45	Yeah, in this little Indian costume-- bracelets on his biceps, and boy, did he have biceps.
480	00:33:45	00:33:47	Trust me.
481	00:33:47	00:33:50	If anybody hurt him, it was Benny Dunbar, Sam's bodyguard.
482	00:33:52	00:33:56	That lump in his jacket ain't a heart full of love.
483	00:34:23	00:34:26	I'll take that camera, kemosabe.
484	00:34:43	00:34:46	Either Benny tossed him or he jumped.
485	00:34:46	00:34:48	We'll never know.
486	00:34:49	00:34:51	This is great stuff for my book.
487	00:34:51	00:34:52	Your what?
488	00:34:52	00:34:58	Oh, this little piece on Vegas history-- stories that didn't make the papers.
489	00:34:58	00:35:01	Honey, if you need to know anything, just ask me.
490	00:35:01	00:35:03	I was there.
491	00:35:03	00:35:06	Well, how about if I take you to dinner tonight?
492	00:35:06	00:35:07	A bottle and a bird.
493	00:35:07	00:35:09	We'll talk about the Peking Pimp.
494	00:35:09	00:35:11	Eddie Chang.
495	00:35:11	00:35:14	They shipped him home in pieces.
496	00:35:15	00:35:21	20 years ago, Verdant Glen was far enough outside Vegas to get the right to use well water for drinking.
497	00:35:21	00:35:24	They also got approval to remove waste water at a private plant.
498	00:35:24	00:35:34	There, it was cleaned, creating grey water, which was used for secondary purposes-- watering lawns, washing cars, everything but drinking.
499	00:35:34	00:35:38	The treatment plant then stored excess grey water in the reservoir.
500	00:35:38	00:35:41	Where they let the kids fish and swim.
501	00:35:41	00:35:43	It passed every water quality test.
502	00:35:43	00:35:49	And the carp from Paul Cyden's freezer had high levels of estrogen plus other prescription drugs.
503	00:35:49	00:35:51	Brian's level and tox panel correlate to the carp.
504	00:35:51	00:35:57	Cyden was collecting water samples from the reservoir, the tap, and the treatment plant.
505	00:35:57	00:35:59	Thanks to Brian.
506	00:35:59	00:36:04	According to Cyden's research, the hormone levels in the tap water are nearly equal to the water in the reservoir.
507	00:36:04	00:36:05	I thought they drink ground water.
508	00:36:05	00:36:06	They do.
509	00:36:06	00:36:09	Cyden was convinced that the ground water was contaminated.
510	00:36:09	00:36:17	How? He discovered that the reservoir was improperly lined, allowing the grey water to leech into the ground water.
511	00:36:17	00:36:20	STOKES; Well, if that's the case, then why didn't the other boys develop breasts?
512	00:36:20	00:36:26	There's a good chance that others have been affected, especially children who were born to women who were living there while they were pregnant.
513	00:36:26	00:36:29	Because the womb is the only place a human lives in fluid...
514	00:36:29	00:36:31	like a fish.
515	00:36:32	00:36:36	That reservoir is supposed to be lined to prevent contamination.
516	00:36:36	00:36:37	Obviously, it's not.
517	00:36:37	00:36:39	Or the lining's defective.
518	00:36:39	00:36:44	Which is the decision I think Cyden had come to right before he was shot.
519	00:36:44	00:36:46	You don't know where he got those samples.
520	00:36:46	00:36:48	Cyden could have pulled them from raw sewage for all I know.
521	00:36:48	00:36:51	And just for the record, that reservoir was built to code.
522	00:36:51	00:36:55	You show me one complaint, one documented illness from that water.
523	00:36:55	00:36:57	What about Brian Towne?
524	00:36:57	00:36:58	Listen...
525	00:36:58	00:37:01	it's a tragedy...
526	00:37:01	00:37:04	but his mother has breast cancer.
527	00:37:04	00:37:07	You don't think it's that gene pool that might be polluted?
528	00:37:07	00:37:08	Let me ask you something.
529	00:37:08	00:37:11	Why did you offer to pay such a big price for Paul Cyden's house?
530	00:37:11	00:37:12	He's a nut.
531	00:37:12	00:37:14	He was trying to sink me.
532	00:37:14	00:37:18	His research was wrong, but perception is reality these days.
533	00:37:18	00:37:19	I admit it.
534	00:37:19	00:37:20	I was trying to buy him off.
535	00:37:20	00:37:22	Would have been money well spent.
536	00:37:22	00:37:24	But he turned you down.
537	00:37:25	00:37:28	Is that why you shot him?
538	00:37:28	00:37:31	I mean, with Brian gone, you're in the clear.
539	00:37:31	00:37:36	Look, I don't need a gun; I've got lawyers.
540	00:37:36	00:37:38	And I would like to speak to them now.
541	00:37:40	00:37:43	Here's the bullets pulled from Paul Cyden.
542	00:37:44	00:37:46	Thanks.
543	00:37:46	00:37:47	Mm-hmm.
544	00:37:52	00:37:55	Well, all three are jacketed hollow points with a center post.
545	00:37:55	00:37:57	Hydra-Shok.
546	00:37:57	00:38:01	Only one company makes them-- Federal.
547	00:38:01	00:38:02	You know what?
548	00:38:04	00:38:07	Cath, I found a box of this same ammo in Brian Towne's bedroom.
549	00:38:09	00:38:10	Five bullets missing.
550	00:38:20	00:38:24	Got five lands and grooves, right-hand twist.
551	00:38:24	00:38:29	Could've been fired from a Smith and Wesson, Ruger, or a Taurus.
552	00:38:31	00:38:35	Brian bought a Ruger SP 101 revolver two weeks ago.
553	00:38:35	00:38:36	Damn.
554	00:38:36	00:38:40	The mother had access to that gun and motive.
555	00:38:40	00:38:46	I was too busy taking care of me...
556	00:38:46	00:38:48	to see what was wrong with him.
557	00:38:50	00:38:52	The signs were there.
558	00:38:52	00:38:55	Mrs. Towne, don't blame yourself.
559	00:38:55	00:39:00	You had a teenager who was depressed and not communicating and you push too hard and they pull away...
560	00:39:00	00:39:02	I should have pushed.
561	00:39:02	00:39:04	If I had gone through his room before he died...
562	00:39:06	00:39:09	maybe then...
563	00:39:09	00:39:12	Is that when you found his gun?
564	00:39:14	00:39:17	I was trying to understand why.
565	00:39:18	00:39:20	I went through his e-mails.
566	00:39:24	00:39:27	Paul was taking him to L.A.
567	00:39:27	00:39:34	I trusted him, and all those years that he pretended to be our friend...
568	00:39:37	00:39:39	He killed my son.
569	00:39:40	00:39:43	Mrs. Towne...
570	00:39:43	00:39:47	he was trying to save your son, not hurt him.
571	00:39:47	00:39:48	We found this letter on Paul's computer.
572	00:39:48	00:39:52	You need to read it.
573	00:39:52	00:39:58	I have decided to alert you to this grave matter prior to contacting the EPA.
574	00:39:58	00:40:08	It is my professional conclusion that the water in this community contains unsafe levels of pharmaceutical contaminants, which have caused irreparable harm to wildlife and humans.
575	00:40:08	00:40:11	One specific example is the case of Brian Towne.
576	00:40:11	00:40:19	His endocrine system and physical body have been 'feminized' due to chronic ingestion of the water at Verdant Glen.
577	00:40:19	00:40:22	He was going to blow the whistle.
578	00:40:22	00:40:28	I think that's what Paul was trying to explain to you when you went over to confront him.
579	00:40:33	00:40:41	I worked two jobs to keep us in our house because... because Brian loved it so much.
580	00:40:47	00:40:50	And being there is what killed him.
581	00:40:56	00:41:00	The feds have already swooped in to investigate the water problem.
582	00:41:00	00:41:03	Do they plan to prosecute Jonah Quinn?
583	00:41:03	00:41:05	They'll try, but Quinn isn't the only one involved.
584	00:41:05	00:41:10	Verdant Glen is now owned by a conglomerate-- the Altimera World Group.
585	00:41:10	00:41:13	They'll bring in experts to contradict the research, discredit witnesses.
586	00:41:14	00:41:18	They'll say that there are chemicals in everything that we eat, touch, breathe.
587	00:41:18	00:41:20	It'll be in litigation for years.
588	00:41:20	00:41:22	What about Brian's mother?
589	00:41:22	00:41:24	Are you going to prosecute her?
590	00:41:24	00:41:32	Did you recover the murder weapon, find her prints in blood at Cyden's house, or get a signed confession?
591	00:41:32	00:41:38	Her son's gun plus motive-- that's not enough?
592	00:41:38	00:41:43	She's a widow with breast cancer who lost her only kid.
593	00:41:46	00:41:50	No way I'd get her in front of a jury and ask them to convict.
594	00:41:51	00:41:53	Nice work though.
595	00:41:55	00:41:58	Lynn Towne goes free.
596	00:41:58	00:42:00	It's all out of our hands now.
597	00:42:00	00:42:03	That's not enough for me.
598	00:42:03	00:42:08	If their lawyers can hog-tie the EPA for years, someone's got to go around them.
599	00:42:09	00:42:13	They've got to take Brian's story and the research to the press.
600	00:42:13	00:42:17	I mean, if... if it's happened here, what's to say there aren't other Brians out there?
601	00:42:17	00:42:21	You can't give information about a case to the media.
602	00:42:22	00:42:23	You'll get fired.
603	00:42:26	00:42:29	As a mother, maybe I don't care.
