0,00:00:08,00:00:10,Unit 584-Adam.
1,00:00:10,00:00:15,Please be advised we're in pursuit of a BMW going southbound on Interstate 15 at a high rate of speed.
2,00:00:21,00:00:23,(tires screeching)
3,00:00:28,00:00:30,(tires screeching)
4,00:00:38,00:00:41,Driver roll down your window.
5,00:00:41,00:00:42,Let me see your hands.
6,00:00:56,00:00:57,GIRL #1: Don't shoot.
7,00:00:57,00:00:58,Don't shoot.
8,00:00:58,00:00:59,Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
9,00:01:01,00:01:04,"OFFICER: Dispatch, Unit 584 is a Code Four."
10,00:01:04,00:01:06,We've got a couple of girls joyriding.
11,00:01:06,00:01:10,"Rookie, clear the vehicle."
12,00:01:10,00:01:12,(garbled radio transmission)
13,00:01:29,00:01:32,4-19?
14,00:01:32,00:01:34,More like a four.
15,00:01:47,00:01:54,"""Ichabod was horrorstruck on perceiving that he was headless."" ...Sleepy Hollow."
16,00:02:01,00:02:04,GRISSOM: Vitreous humor is glazed over.
17,00:02:04,00:02:05,What does that mean?
18,00:02:05,00:02:08,That means that six to eight hours ago somebody lost their head.
19,00:02:08,00:02:11,Then... somebody lost their head.

21,00:02:55,00:02:57,"Well, well, what a switch."
22,00:02:57,00:02:59,You actually beat us here.
23,00:02:59,00:03:01,It's evaluation day.
24,00:03:01,00:03:02,Hmm.
25,00:03:02,00:03:03,Where's Warrick?
26,00:03:03,00:03:07,He was working spill-over on another case.
27,00:03:07,00:03:08,"Oh, that's right."
28,00:03:08,00:03:10,He told me. I forgot.
29,00:03:10,00:03:12,"Well, maybe we should be evaluating you."
30,00:03:12,00:03:13,"You're a riot, Alice."
31,00:03:13,00:03:15,You and I are going to work the head case.
32,00:03:15,00:03:17,Goody.
33,00:03:17,00:03:18,"Nick, another homicide."
34,00:03:18,00:03:20,"""4-19"" 40 miles outside of Baker."
35,00:03:20,00:03:21,Okay. Good... I'm on it.
36,00:03:21,00:03:23,"GRISSOM: Sara, you go with him."
37,00:03:23,00:03:25,Yes. Road trip.
38,00:03:25,00:03:29,I'm going to go switch boots.
39,00:03:31,00:03:35,"GRISSOM: Cath, I'll catch up with you."
40,00:03:35,00:03:37,I'll meet you at the autopsy.
41,00:03:37,00:03:38,Head-topsy.
42,00:03:41,00:03:42,Sit down.
43,00:03:44,00:03:52,"Look, Grissom I know this is a bad time to bitch to the boss but, uh, I've been a CSI Level 3 for nine months now."
44,00:03:52,00:03:54,I was a CSI before Warrick.
45,00:03:54,00:03:56,Warrick works d.b.'s solo.
46,00:03:56,00:03:58,Why can't I?
47,00:03:59,00:04:00,Repeat after me.
48,00:04:00,00:04:02,"Silk, silk, silk."
49,00:04:02,00:04:04,"""Silk, silk, silk""?"
50,00:04:04,00:04:04,What do cows drink?
51,00:04:04,00:04:05,Milk.
52,00:04:05,00:04:07,Cows drink water.
53,00:04:07,00:04:08,Theygivemilk.
54,00:04:08,00:04:10,A simple riddle.
55,00:04:10,00:04:18,"Common sense disguised in a puzzle of words, but an excellent barometer for evaluating someone's readiness."
56,00:04:18,00:04:21,"Look, I'm not one of your suspects you can trick, okay?"
57,00:04:21,00:04:25,"If I'm not ready, be a man-- tell me I'm not ready."
58,00:04:25,00:04:26,You're not ready.
59,00:04:31,00:04:33,You know why I took this job?
60,00:04:33,00:04:35,Honestly?
61,00:04:35,00:04:40,I wanted to pack heat walk under the yellow tape be the man...
62,00:04:40,00:04:45,"but mostly, because I want you to think I'm a good CSI."
63,00:04:47,00:04:49,And that's the reason I have to hold you back.
64,00:04:54,00:05:01,"Anybody who's great at anything, Nick does it for their own approval not someone else's."
65,00:05:06,00:05:10,(hard rock playing)
66,00:05:15,00:05:17,(turns down volume)
67,00:05:18,00:05:19,"Uh, voice sound familiar?"
68,00:05:19,00:05:23,Kind of sounds like the daytime coroner.
69,00:05:23,00:05:24,Gary Telgenhoff?
70,00:05:24,00:05:27,Yep. A songwriter in his off-time.
71,00:05:27,00:05:28,What do you think?
72,00:05:28,00:05:30,It sucks.
73,00:05:30,00:05:31,Hmm.
74,00:05:31,00:05:32,"Hey, I just filed for divorce."
75,00:05:32,00:05:34,I'm feeling a little confident.
76,00:05:34,00:05:35,I guess.
77,00:05:35,00:05:38,I like it.
78,00:05:38,00:05:40,"So, where's the head?"
79,00:05:40,00:05:46,"Well, police ID'd him at the scene when they ran his plates compared the DMV head shot to the head."
80,00:05:47,00:05:48,"Grissom, Catherine, meet Victor DaSilva."
81,00:05:58,00:05:59,What did this?
82,00:05:59,00:06:02,Hard to tell without making a mold.
83,00:06:02,00:06:03,Fatal blow?
84,00:06:03,00:06:04,Looks like it.
85,00:06:04,00:06:07,"Man, look at those chopping wounds on the jawbone."
86,00:06:07,00:06:11,They almost look like practice swings.
87,00:06:11,00:06:12,It could've been dark.
88,00:06:12,00:06:14,"Bad aim, maybe?"
89,00:06:14,00:06:17,Definitely a crime of passion.
90,00:06:17,00:06:19,You think a female could do this?
91,00:06:19,00:06:20,I could have.
92,00:06:22,00:06:24,Scared of you.
93,00:06:24,00:06:28,"If you want to know what ""exact"" tools were used we're going to need to boil the head."
94,00:06:28,00:06:29,Really?
95,00:06:29,00:06:31,You want me to prepare it?
96,00:06:31,00:06:34,"Sure. What, uh, additive do you put in your boil?"
97,00:06:34,00:06:35,Laundry detergent. Works great.
98,00:06:36,00:06:38,It's like peeling off a rubber Halloween mask.
99,00:06:38,00:06:39,Excellent.
100,00:06:39,00:06:40,"Well, I'm out of here."
101,00:06:41,00:06:45,I'm going to be with Brass; see if I can get anything on those Victoria Secret girls.
102,00:06:47,00:06:49,"Where's your Crock-Pot, Doc?"
103,00:06:51,00:06:52,Mr. Moore.
104,00:06:54,00:06:56,My grandson won't take my calls.
105,00:06:56,00:06:58,He'll only talk to you.
106,00:06:58,00:07:02,I think James called me tonight because he thought I could help him.
107,00:07:02,00:07:07,That was a nice thing you did giving him your pager number when he went away but he should be calling me.
108,00:07:07,00:07:08,I'm his grandfather.
109,00:07:08,00:07:10,I deserve to know what happened.
110,00:07:10,00:07:14,"James is all right but, uh, there was a big brawl at the detention center."
111,00:07:14,00:07:17,James was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
112,00:07:19,00:07:21,What's my grandson looking at?
113,00:07:21,00:07:26,"If he talks, he'll be dead inside a month."
114,00:07:26,00:07:33,"Now, if he keeps quiet, the D.A. will put the squeeze on him and he'll probably end up in the big house."
115,00:07:33,00:07:35,You could lose your boy forever then.
116,00:07:35,00:07:38,Why didn't James call me...
117,00:07:38,00:07:40,tell me?
118,00:07:40,00:07:44,He probably knew what your advice would be.
119,00:07:46,00:07:47,To do the honorable thing.
120,00:07:47,00:07:49,There's no honor in jail.
121,00:07:50,00:07:53,Not without a price.
122,00:07:53,00:07:55,"Look, a crime occurred."
123,00:07:55,00:07:58,CSI's got full jurisdiction.
124,00:07:58,00:08:04,I got myself assigned to the case-- see if I can take James out of the middle.
125,00:08:14,00:08:17,Can we offer you girls something to drink?
126,00:08:18,00:08:20,Please don't say that word.
127,00:08:20,00:08:25,You want to tell us why two college freshmen were driving a stolen BMW with a head in the trunk?
128,00:08:25,00:08:26,We already told you.
129,00:08:26,00:08:29,We had no idea that was in the trunk.
130,00:08:29,00:08:30,Gross.
131,00:08:30,00:08:37,"Now there's a start-- ""gross."" Gross negligence-- flying down I-15 in a stolen car."
132,00:08:37,00:08:42,Gross anatomy-- a human bowling ball in the trunk.
133,00:08:42,00:08:45,Gross details-- let's hear it.
134,00:08:47,00:08:50,We lost our friends at Bar 9-1-1.
135,00:08:53,00:08:55,We had no ride home.
136,00:08:56,00:08:56,We were bored.
137,00:08:57,00:09:03,"So, we started doing shots of tequila with some guy who looked like... like Cat Stevens."
138,00:09:03,00:09:05,(girls squealing)
139,00:09:06,00:09:08,Whoo!
140,00:09:08,00:09:11,"Next thing we know, we're in his van playing strip poker."
141,00:09:11,00:09:14,I can't believe we're doing this.
142,00:09:14,00:09:16,It was a blast at first.
143,00:09:16,00:09:18,"Then, um..."
144,00:09:18,00:09:20,then he said the creepiest thing.
145,00:09:20,00:09:26,"So, I met this girl on the Internet who offered me a round-trip ticket to fly out and help her end her life."
146,00:09:26,00:09:30,She wanted me to shove a tennis ball down her throat.
147,00:09:36,00:09:37,"Lori! Lori, over here! Lori!"
148,00:09:44,00:09:46,WILLOWS: Let me guess.
149,00:09:46,00:09:48,You left your clothes in the van.
150,00:09:48,00:09:49,We were so out of there.
151,00:09:49,00:09:51,This guy was weird.
152,00:09:51,00:09:52,Like way weird.
153,00:09:52,00:10:08,"I was thinking that he was going to pull a Silence of the Lambs on me and tell me to ""put the lotion in the basket."" You know what I think?"
154,00:10:08,00:10:11,I don't think you two are murderers.
155,00:10:11,00:10:19,"I think you're just felony stupid but for now, you're being booked on evading arrest, grand theft auto DWI."
156,00:10:20,00:10:22,You go with this officer here.
157,00:10:25,00:10:28,MAN (over P.A. system): Stabbing in Barracks A.
158,00:10:28,00:10:30,Lock down in effect.
159,00:10:30,00:10:32,"Guards to their post, please."
160,00:10:33,00:10:43,"I love my Grandpa-- don't get me wrong-- but he's got no idea how it works in here and I'm not sure you do, either."
161,00:10:43,00:10:46,Why don't you tell me?
162,00:10:46,00:10:49,"First off, this place only sees two colors: black and white."
163,00:10:49,00:10:50,You stay with your own.
164,00:10:51,00:10:56,Despite what those Chucks think upstairs this entire place is infiltrated with Rolling 60s.
165,00:10:56,00:10:58,Overflow from L.A.
166,00:10:58,00:11:00,"Lot of education in a short time, huh?"
167,00:11:01,00:11:02,Yeah.
168,00:11:02,00:11:05,"I mean, I'm just trying to survive, man."
169,00:11:05,00:11:09,I'm 60 days and a wake-up unless I get got.
170,00:11:09,00:11:14,"James, why don't you take a deep breath and tell me what happened here?"
171,00:11:14,00:11:16,First you got to tell me something.
172,00:11:16,00:11:18,You got to tell me what side you're on.
173,00:11:18,00:11:22,Who's side I'm on?
174,00:11:22,00:11:23,"Who reached out to you, man?"
175,00:11:23,00:11:25,Who put me in here?
176,00:11:25,00:11:28,"James, I'm trying to help you."
177,00:11:35,00:11:36,All right.
178,00:11:39,00:11:45,Breaks down like this-- Kingpin from Gerson Park and Kingpin from L.A. County/Slauson both under one roof.
179,00:11:46,00:11:48,It was time for one of them to stake their claim.
180,00:11:48,00:11:51,Vegas fool got shanked.
181,00:11:51,00:11:53,I was sitting right there.
182,00:11:55,00:12:01,Since I'm the new face and only witness lot of fingers pointed towards me.
183,00:12:03,00:12:06,"So, it's your life versus time."
184,00:12:06,00:12:10,"Basically, yeah and everybody knows about it."
185,00:12:10,00:12:13,They're just waiting to see what I'm going to do.
186,00:12:13,00:12:16,I sing... they send me a song back.
187,00:12:18,00:12:21,I shut up... I'm your age when I get out.
188,00:12:30,00:12:31,Who found the body?
189,00:12:31,00:12:33,MAN: Department of Agriculture.
190,00:12:33,00:12:36,They were searching for wild horses in their chopper when they found it.
191,00:12:36,00:12:39,None of the boys would even go near it.
192,00:12:40,00:12:42,I had to tape the perimeter myself.
193,00:12:42,00:12:43,"Where is ""it""?"
194,00:12:43,00:12:45,Just follow my prints.
195,00:12:57,00:12:59,"Oh, man."
196,00:13:04,00:13:06,It's the rest of him.
197,00:13:06,00:13:08,It looks like he's been skinned.
198,00:13:08,00:13:12,Uh... Hands and feet have been amputated.
199,00:13:12,00:13:14,Yeah.
200,00:13:14,00:13:16,Most likely to avoid I.D.
201,00:13:17,00:13:19,"Hey, Sara?"
202,00:13:19,00:13:20,Yeah?
203,00:13:20,00:13:23,No approaching surface prints.
204,00:13:23,00:13:26,No tire tracks.
205,00:13:26,00:13:27,Only O'Riley's boot prints.
206,00:13:27,00:13:28,These are ours.
207,00:13:31,00:13:33,Look at the area around the corpse.
208,00:13:33,00:13:35,"Look at the big dent in the ground, like a meteor hit."
209,00:13:46,00:13:48,INMATE: That guy's from the crime lab.
210,00:13:48,00:13:50,"You gonna spray some chemical stuff over the barracks, man?"
211,00:13:51,00:13:52,"Hey, what you got in the tackle box, man?"
212,00:13:52,00:13:53,You going fishing?
213,00:13:53,00:13:54,"Hey, brother, what's up?"
214,00:13:54,00:13:56,Let me talk to you real quick.
215,00:13:58,00:13:59,Welcome to juvie.
216,00:13:59,00:14:00,It's all yours.
217,00:15:17,00:15:19,I'm not sure you should be doing this.
218,00:15:19,00:15:20,What are we doing?
219,00:15:20,00:15:22,Walking through the garage.
220,00:15:22,00:15:26,Snooping for trace on Grissom and Catherine's stolen BMW?
221,00:15:26,00:15:28,All right. It's simple.
222,00:15:28,00:15:30,"We got the body, they got the head."
223,00:15:30,00:15:31,The BMW's fair game.
224,00:15:32,00:15:34,"Come on, Sara, where's your ""Noriega""?"
225,00:15:34,00:15:36,What has gotten into you?
226,00:15:36,00:15:37,Grissom.
227,00:16:09,00:16:12,Uh... Sara...
228,00:16:12,00:16:13,want to take a look at this?
229,00:16:13,00:16:17,"It's like nothing I've seen before-- honestly, Gil-- in all my years."
230,00:16:17,00:16:18,The head or the torso?
231,00:16:18,00:16:19,Torso.
232,00:16:19,00:16:27,Look at the width of the ribcage-- it's enormous-- and the shoulders are significantly larger in proportion and size compared to the average endomorph.
233,00:16:27,00:16:29,The bone structure is disproportionate.
234,00:16:29,00:16:32,Correct.
235,00:16:32,00:16:39,I measured the tibia and fibula around the ankle area then the radius and the ulna at the wrists-- the bones are 10-15% larger than the standard Homo sapiens.
236,00:16:39,00:16:42,Left fracture of the ischial prominence of the pelvis.
237,00:16:42,00:16:44,Fracture of the pubis synphisus.
238,00:16:44,00:16:46,Fracture of the lumbar spine vertebrae...
239,00:16:46,00:16:48,Anythingnotbroken?
240,00:16:48,00:16:54,"No, the trauma's similar to some of the leapers I get in here: out of state, out of cash and out the window."
241,00:16:54,00:16:55,Suicide by hotel.
242,00:16:55,00:16:57,This was not a hotel.
243,00:16:57,00:17:02,What you see here is the flattening and expansion of the body that could only be caused by the impact of a very steep fall.
244,00:17:04,00:17:10,"If I know anything, I know two unequivocal truths: DaSilva's head does not belong to this body."
245,00:17:10,00:17:13,And the reason I know that is because the torso is not human.
246,00:17:13,00:17:16,What is it?
247,00:17:16,00:17:18,I don't know.
248,00:17:19,00:17:21,You're going to need an anthropologist.
249,00:17:31,00:17:32,Mm-hmm.
250,00:17:33,00:17:34,Uh-huh.
251,00:17:39,00:17:41,(sighs)
252,00:17:41,00:17:43,Squirrels love 'em...
253,00:17:44,00:17:47,they get tossed at Dodger Stadium and they make a hell of a butter.
254,00:17:47,00:17:48,You're nuts. You know that.
255,00:17:49,00:17:51,Exacta mundo.
256,00:17:52,00:17:56,Peanuts! Right scope's the shell left scope's the skin of the nut.
257,00:17:56,00:18:00,"Think ""peanuts EspaÃÂ±ol."" Peanuts on the gas pedal. You're kidding."
258,00:18:00,00:18:01,Mm-mm.
259,00:18:01,00:18:04,That's one of those funny clues.
260,00:18:04,00:18:06,"Could mean nothing, could mean everything."
261,00:18:06,00:18:08,Hmm.
262,00:18:13,00:18:15,Whoa.
263,00:18:16,00:18:17,"Who are you, pal?"
264,00:18:17,00:18:19,I'm Trent Calloway. Who are you?
265,00:18:19,00:18:22,I'm Jim Brass. Homicide.
266,00:18:22,00:18:24,This is Gil Grissom.
267,00:18:24,00:18:25,Crime Lab.
268,00:18:25,00:18:27,Does a Victor DaSilva live here?
269,00:18:27,00:18:28,"Yeah, but he's out."
270,00:18:28,00:18:30,And you're in. I'm painting the house.
271,00:18:31,00:18:33,In the middle of the night?
272,00:18:34,00:18:35,"Back up, Slick."
273,00:18:35,00:18:37,We got some questions.
274,00:18:39,00:18:41,GRISSOM: So when was the last time you saw Victor DaSilva?
275,00:18:42,00:18:44,A day or two ago.
276,00:18:46,00:18:49,This whole painting thing had him stressed out.
277,00:18:51,00:18:56,"""Picking up airheads just got easier."" Yeah, he worked freelance, mostly."
278,00:18:56,00:18:57,"He won a ""Bandy"" award for that one."
279,00:18:58,00:18:58,He worked for an ad agency.
280,00:18:59,00:19:00,What else did he do for a living?
281,00:19:00,00:19:02,"That's it, as far as I know."
282,00:19:02,00:19:03,What about you?
283,00:19:03,00:19:06,"I mean, besides painting walls."
284,00:19:06,00:19:08,I'm a bouncer at the French Palace.
285,00:19:08,00:19:10,I throw guys like you out.
286,00:19:10,00:19:11,(chuckles)
287,00:19:11,00:19:13,Yeah.
288,00:19:13,00:19:16,"You know, you don't seem too shook up about DaSilva's death."
289,00:19:16,00:19:17,We weren't that close.
290,00:19:17,00:19:22,"We had some mutual friends, he needed someone to help him with this place and, uh, I never turn down a job."
291,00:19:22,00:19:25,"Well, I hope you get paid in advance."
292,00:20:08,00:20:13,"Found a picture of Victor DaSilva and, uh... somebody."
293,00:20:13,00:20:14,What does that mean?
294,00:20:14,00:20:16,Cut out.
295,00:20:20,00:20:22,"So bizarre, human behavior."
296,00:20:22,00:20:26,What you can't cut out of your mind you can always cut out of your photo album.
297,00:20:26,00:20:28,Why are we in the closet?
298,00:20:28,00:20:31,"I got a call from Greg Sanders, at our lab."
299,00:20:31,00:20:35,He found peanut shells on the foot pedals of Victor DaSilva's car.
300,00:20:35,00:20:37,Hmm.
301,00:20:41,00:20:44,And voila.
302,00:20:44,00:20:47,"Mr. Calloway, would you mind coming in here, please?"
303,00:20:48,00:20:51,Mr. Calloway...
304,00:20:51,00:20:59,is there a remote possibility that Victor DaSilva ever worked at a concession stand of some sort like at a ballpark or...
305,00:20:59,00:21:04,the Secret Garden of Siegfried and Roy in the elephants' habitat?
306,00:21:04,00:21:06,I don't think it's Victor's style.
307,00:21:06,00:21:08,This is ridiculous.
308,00:21:08,00:21:12,"Well, not according to his size 11s."
309,00:21:19,00:21:21,Telling you...
310,00:21:21,00:21:24,the kids in here got nothing but time.
311,00:21:24,00:21:27,You'd be surprised what they can come up with.
312,00:21:27,00:21:28,WARRICK: Nothing surprises me anymore.
313,00:21:28,00:21:31,Yeah? Wait awhile.
314,00:21:31,00:21:33,This is the main thoroughfare for all the toilets.
315,00:21:33,00:21:38,All the goods come through here.
316,00:21:38,00:21:42,"You know, it's funny, I wanted to be a surgeon."
317,00:21:42,00:21:44,(sighs)
318,00:21:44,00:21:45,Step back for Molly.
319,00:21:54,00:21:56,Step back for Warrick.
320,00:22:00,00:22:03,Whew!
321,00:22:08,00:22:09,(groans)
322,00:22:10,00:22:12,Whew!
323,00:22:12,00:22:15,(sighs)
324,00:22:18,00:22:21,Man...
325,00:22:29,00:22:32,Impressive.
326,00:22:35,00:22:37,"ROBBINS: Well, Dr. Miller..."
327,00:22:37,00:22:40,just what exactly are we looking at here?
328,00:22:44,00:22:47,The specimen's pelvic girdle and spine...
329,00:22:47,00:22:51,are curved and upright suggesting the species may be quadrupedal.
330,00:22:52,00:22:57,The left and right femur and humerus are derivative of theTarsius.
331,00:22:59,00:23:00,(sighs)
332,00:23:00,00:23:02,I think I know what this is.
333,00:23:04,00:23:07,"The preliminary evaluation is correct, Dr. Robbins."
334,00:23:09,00:23:11,"It's not human, it's a primate."
335,00:23:11,00:23:14,"More specifically, a gorilla."
336,00:23:25,00:23:30,NARRATOR (on computer): Bushmeat Hunters thrive on the murdering of gorillas for profit.
337,00:23:30,00:23:34,In the United States their meat is considered a delicacy.
338,00:23:34,00:23:39,It is said if the animal is ingested its great powers will be passed on to the consumer.
339,00:23:43,00:23:45,What are you doing?
340,00:23:45,00:23:46,Working the case.
341,00:23:46,00:23:48,What case?
342,00:23:48,00:23:49,The skinned gorilla-- torso...
343,00:23:49,00:23:50,40 miles outside of Baker.
344,00:23:51,00:23:52,Remember?
345,00:23:52,00:23:54,I don't think that is a case.
346,00:23:54,00:23:56,"Well, it was at the start of shift."
347,00:23:56,00:23:58,A crime has been committed.
348,00:23:58,00:24:01,"I hate to be the one to state the obvious, but, uh..."
349,00:24:01,00:24:05,this isn't a human being we're dealing with-- it's an animal.
350,00:24:07,00:24:08,And...
351,00:24:08,00:24:13,And every time a dog gets run over you can't go to the vet to examine it.
352,00:24:13,00:24:14,(chortles)
353,00:24:14,00:24:15,I can't believe you.
354,00:24:16,00:24:21,"You, with your pet tarantula your maggot farms, that Komodo dragon on back order..."
355,00:24:21,00:24:27,You should be more sympathetic to the senseless murder of an innocent gorilla.
356,00:24:27,00:24:29,You're right.
357,00:24:29,00:24:31,I apologize.
358,00:24:31,00:24:34,I was just checking to see whereyourhead was at.
359,00:24:34,00:24:36,"For now, you're working alone."
360,00:24:36,00:24:37,Catherine needed Nick.
361,00:24:37,00:24:39,Bummer.
362,00:24:39,00:24:40,We got another dead body call.
363,00:24:40,00:24:42,Wait. Is he missing a head?
364,00:24:42,00:24:43,Maybe.
365,00:24:43,00:24:47,"Meantime, you're on standby in case Nick needs backup."
366,00:24:48,00:24:50,Your evaluation form.
367,00:24:50,00:25:01,"""Overall performance: Outstanding."" ""Ability to prioritize: Improvement needed."" You up for a riddle?"
368,00:25:01,00:25:02,Sure. Why not?
369,00:25:03,00:25:05,"Okay, repeat after me: Silk, silk, silk."
370,00:25:05,00:25:07,"Silk, silk, silk."
371,00:25:07,00:25:09,What do cows drink?
372,00:25:09,00:25:12,Water. Why?
373,00:25:12,00:25:13,Never mind.
374,00:25:14,00:25:17,Who thought that a toothbrush could take a kid's life?
375,00:25:18,00:25:20,"Well, the son of a bitch was crafty, I'll give him that."
376,00:25:20,00:25:22,Melted the end of the toothbrush to insert the razor blade.
377,00:25:22,00:25:23,Then why the rubber band?
378,00:25:26,00:25:27,Concealment.
379,00:25:28,00:25:29,"Oh, that's deep."
380,00:25:29,00:25:34,Yeah. Now all I got to do is put this shank in someone's hand.
381,00:25:49,00:25:51,Hey...
382,00:25:51,00:25:53,here's something new.
383,00:25:58,00:26:00,The cousin of footprints.
384,00:26:02,00:26:03,Sock prints... look.
385,00:26:03,00:26:05,That's not from a shoe.
386,00:26:05,00:26:07,Look at the fabric impressions.
387,00:26:07,00:26:09,The guy ran out of here in his socks.
388,00:26:09,00:26:10,Mm-hmm.
389,00:26:10,00:26:15,Perp thought he could cover his tracks by taking off his shoes.
390,00:26:15,00:26:16,He thought wrong.
391,00:26:20,00:26:24,Manager spotted the blood during a night sweep.
392,00:26:24,00:26:28,Want to know who the shed was registered to?
393,00:26:28,00:26:29,Victor DaSilva.
394,00:26:29,00:26:31,Our head.
395,00:26:31,00:26:32,Oh...
396,00:26:32,00:26:34,So this is the rest of his body?
397,00:26:34,00:26:37,It ain't gorilla.
398,00:26:38,00:26:39,(sighs)
399,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Well, this amount of blood suggests that the victim was killed here."
400,00:26:45,00:26:49,Why don't I do the one-to-ones and you start looking for the weapon?
401,00:26:49,00:26:52,"Yeah, whatever punctures, whatever chops."
402,00:27:29,00:27:31,Bob Villa.
403,00:27:31,00:27:34,Paul Bunyan.
404,00:27:34,00:27:39,"WILLOWS: By the way, what about my evaluation?"
405,00:27:39,00:27:43,"Keep up the good work, Catherine."
406,00:27:43,00:27:45,Are those molds dry yet?
407,00:27:47,00:27:49,They're tacky.
408,00:27:52,00:27:54,"Hmm, positive to positive."
409,00:27:54,00:27:56,"That'll never hold up in court, though."
410,00:27:56,00:27:58,We're going to need to make negative molds.
411,00:27:58,00:28:00,Tabling the ax.
412,00:28:00,00:28:02,Hammer time.
413,00:28:04,00:28:06,Um...
414,00:28:07,00:28:08,Pretty close.
415,00:28:08,00:28:11,"All right, I fed the measurements from the claw end of the hammer."
416,00:28:25,00:28:27,Something doesn't seem right about this.
417,00:28:31,00:28:36,Why would you use the claw end of the hammer to kill him and not the hammer end?
418,00:28:42,00:28:43,Wait a minute.
419,00:28:43,00:28:46,Maybe it wasn't about hitting him in the head.
420,00:28:46,00:28:50,Maybe it was about fitting him in the locker.
421,00:29:06,00:29:08,"So, the footlocker had no head room."
422,00:29:08,00:29:10,Exactly.
423,00:29:18,00:29:22,"So, uh, tricky Nick what did you get on your evaluation?"
424,00:29:22,00:29:23,It's private.
425,00:29:23,00:29:26,"Yeah, but how many ""outstandings"" did Grissom give you?"
426,00:29:26,00:29:27,Enough.
427,00:29:28,00:29:29,DaSilva had a nice pad.
428,00:29:29,00:29:32,What did he tell you to look for?
429,00:29:32,00:29:34,Grissom didn't tell me anything.
430,00:29:34,00:29:37,I put this together myself.
431,00:29:39,00:29:41,"Give me some light here, will you, partner?"
432,00:29:41,00:29:42,Yeah.
433,00:29:42,00:29:49,"All right, it's like this: sock prints were found at the crime scene, size 11."
434,00:29:49,00:29:53,"Shoes Grissom took from the closet here, size 11."
435,00:29:53,00:29:55,DaSilva's shoe size: Ten.
436,00:29:55,00:29:57,So whose size 11's were they?
437,00:29:57,00:29:59,Grissom is something.
438,00:29:59,00:30:02,(sighs)
439,00:30:31,00:30:35,"SIDLE: ""Spur's Corral."" I know that place."
440,00:30:35,00:30:40,They give you peanuts for starters instead of bread or chips and salsa.
441,00:30:40,00:30:41,I'm calling Grissom.
442,00:30:41,00:30:43,"Look, you obviously don't need my help."
443,00:30:43,00:30:46,I-I got go put something to rest.
444,00:30:46,00:30:47,See you later?
445,00:30:47,00:30:48,"All right, thanks."
446,00:30:49,00:30:53,"GRISSOM: The body from the storage shed-- it's Victor DaSilva, all right."
447,00:30:53,00:30:54,We ran his prints.
448,00:30:54,00:30:56,It's nice that he still had his hands.
449,00:30:56,00:30:57,I was wrong about the cause of death.
450,00:30:58,00:30:59,The hammer didn't do it?
451,00:30:59,00:31:01,No. He was shot point blank in the heart.
452,00:31:01,00:31:03,.380.
453,00:31:03,00:31:05,Imagine the human heart as an apple.
454,00:31:08,00:31:10,Instant liquefaction.
455,00:31:10,00:31:14,We found everything else in that shed; I don't know why we didn't find a gun.
456,00:31:14,00:31:16,"Well, maybe he was shot somewhere else?"
457,00:31:16,00:31:18,That would explain the plastic.
458,00:31:18,00:31:20,What plastic?
459,00:31:20,00:31:23,You never told me about any plastic.
460,00:31:23,00:31:24,I didn't?
461,00:31:24,00:31:26,Oh.
462,00:31:26,00:31:28,The victim was wrapped in a plastic sheet.
463,00:31:28,00:31:31,Victor DaSilva's entire house was covered in plastic.
464,00:31:31,00:31:32,He was having it painted.
465,00:31:32,00:31:34,Really? Who's the painter?
466,00:31:35,00:31:36,Nobody famous.
467,00:31:36,00:31:37,Yet.
468,00:31:43,00:31:45,You had access to Victor DaSilva's house?
469,00:31:45,00:31:47,"Yeah, I was painting it. You own a gun?"
470,00:31:47,00:31:49,I don't mean a paint gun.
471,00:31:49,00:31:50,No. WILLOWS: Let's get to it.
472,00:31:50,00:31:51,What's your shoe size?
473,00:31:52,00:31:52,Why?
474,00:31:53,00:31:54,I have a shoe fetish.
475,00:31:54,00:31:55,I love feet.
476,00:31:55,00:31:58,It's 13.
477,00:31:58,00:31:59,Take off your shoes and socks.
478,00:31:59,00:32:01,We need to verify.
479,00:32:10,00:32:12,Okay...
480,00:32:12,00:32:13,step on the paper.
481,00:32:27,00:32:30,Two sizes too big.
482,00:32:34,00:32:36,"I'd tell you not to step on the evidence, but, uh..."
483,00:32:36,00:32:38,"Yeah, but what's the point?"
484,00:32:38,00:32:40,"Pretty good gimmick they got here, though."
485,00:32:40,00:32:44,"You eat peanuts, toss the shells on the floor-- nobody gives a rat's ass."
486,00:32:50,00:32:52,"No, Victor DaSilva never worked here."
487,00:32:52,00:32:54,We found one of your uniforms in his closet.
488,00:32:55,00:32:56,Any idea how it got there?
489,00:32:57,00:33:00,"Guys-- look, boss, I'm sorry."
490,00:33:01,00:33:02,I thought I was on to something here.
491,00:33:03,00:33:04,I had a conflict in shoe sizes.
492,00:33:04,00:33:06,"So, I thought I'd play a hunch."
493,00:33:06,00:33:07,Sara was right there.
494,00:33:07,00:33:08,We checked out the shoes...
495,00:33:08,00:33:13,(Nick continues talking in background)
496,00:33:13,00:33:17,...so that's why I buzzed you guys down.
497,00:33:17,00:33:20,"You got to follow your hunches, right?"
498,00:33:20,00:33:22,"Yeah, sure."
499,00:33:22,00:33:26,Tim? You still got that picture that you took from DaSilva's house?
500,00:33:26,00:33:27,Yeah.
501,00:33:27,00:33:29,"Yeah, here it is."
502,00:33:41,00:33:43,What? You're looking at the sombrero?
503,00:33:45,00:33:47,The earrings.
504,00:33:47,00:33:50,Victor DaSilva was here with someone he cut out of his life.
505,00:33:51,00:33:52,Probably his girlfriend.
506,00:33:52,00:33:52,Excuse me.
507,00:33:54,00:33:58,You recognize this ear?
508,00:33:58,00:34:00,You got to be kidding me.
509,00:34:01,00:34:03,Wait a minute.
510,00:34:03,00:34:04,"Yeah, I do."
511,00:34:04,00:34:07,I do recognize those earrings.
512,00:34:07,00:34:11,GRISSOM: Fred Applewhite?
513,00:34:11,00:34:13,You all here for lunch?
514,00:34:13,00:34:15,No. Take out.
515,00:34:17,00:34:20,I heard you were disassembling the gorilla.
516,00:34:20,00:34:21,For purposes of disease control.
517,00:34:22,00:34:26,"Per the CDC, I have to take samples and dispose of this animal immediately."
518,00:34:26,00:34:31,"Well, I've been trying to find out who did this to her and, um, I have some questions."
519,00:34:31,00:34:34,"You ask, I'll answer."
520,00:34:34,00:34:35,Why amputate the gorilla's head?
521,00:34:35,00:34:36,It's a trophy.
522,00:34:36,00:34:40,"American fetishers would pay up to $10,000 for the head of a Low Land Gorilla."
523,00:34:40,00:34:41,The hands and feet?
524,00:34:41,00:34:42,Novelty items.
525,00:34:42,00:34:44,Sold as ashtrays.
526,00:34:44,00:34:48,Here Nick and I were thinking it was to avoid I.D.
527,00:34:48,00:34:51,Why skin it?
528,00:34:51,00:34:56,"Purses, shoes, boots... it's sad."
529,00:34:56,00:35:00,Genetically we're 92.7% identical with gorillas.
530,00:35:00,00:35:03,It's hard to tell where the human ends and the animal begins.
531,00:35:03,00:35:04,Well said.
532,00:35:04,00:35:07,I checked out a couple of websites...
533,00:35:07,00:35:09,"Bushmeat.net, Gorilla.org."
534,00:35:09,00:35:15,I think she was killed probably in Cameroon or Congo transported to the Port of Los Angeles.
535,00:35:15,00:35:17,"Dismembered, packaged..."
536,00:35:17,00:35:18,loaded onto a small plane.
537,00:35:18,00:35:25,"En route, they dumped what they couldn't sell but, uh, I just have to find the plane."
538,00:35:25,00:35:26,Needle in a haystack.
539,00:35:26,00:35:32,"Chances are, whoever did this are halfway around the world by now."
540,00:35:32,00:35:33,There must be something I can do.
541,00:35:33,00:35:36,"Actually, there is."
542,00:36:03,00:36:07,For everyone that parts one stands above ground.
543,00:36:17,00:36:20,"Okay, Mr. Applewhite..."
544,00:36:20,00:36:21,take a walk.
545,00:36:31,00:36:33,"Okay, great."
546,00:36:33,00:36:35,"Now, Mr. Applewhite..."
547,00:36:35,00:36:38,"this time, I want you to do something different."
548,00:36:39,00:36:40,This time...
549,00:36:40,00:36:42,run.
550,00:36:47,00:36:53,GRISSOM: Footprints are almost as reliable as fingerprints and every step tells a story.
551,00:36:53,00:36:55,"The first few steps, you were walking."
552,00:36:55,00:36:59,"See the complete heel, arch and five little piggies?"
553,00:36:59,00:37:02,"The next few steps, however..."
554,00:37:04,00:37:06,the heel disappears.
555,00:37:06,00:37:10,All of the pressure was put on ball of the foot and toes. Why?
556,00:37:10,00:37:12,'Cause you were running...
557,00:37:12,00:37:15,and my guess is that on the day you had a head in your hand.
558,00:37:15,00:37:19,"STOKES: You see, everyone's foot makes a unique well impression."
559,00:37:19,00:37:20,Check it out.
560,00:37:20,00:37:24,"The, uh width... the ball of the foot..."
561,00:37:24,00:37:27,"instep... arch... and, uh..."
562,00:37:28,00:37:30,size 11 for dessert.
563,00:37:30,00:37:35,GRISSOM: Mr. Applewhite your footprints... place you at the crime scene.
564,00:37:37,00:37:38,Victor and I were partners.
565,00:37:38,00:37:42,We shared everything including in our house and in the storage shed.
566,00:37:42,00:37:44,We know that. When did you move out?
567,00:37:44,00:37:46,Three months ago.
568,00:37:46,00:37:48,He found somebody else...
569,00:37:48,00:37:49,kicked me out.
570,00:37:50,00:37:52,And you took all your possessions with you?
571,00:37:52,00:37:55,"Not everything. So, you were hoping for a reconciliation."
572,00:37:55,00:37:56,Yeah.
573,00:37:57,00:38:02,I thought once Victor got this new guy out of his system he'd come around.
574,00:38:02,00:38:03,"But he didn't, did he?"
575,00:38:03,00:38:06,That's why you went to his house last night.
576,00:38:06,00:38:07,Who said I went there?
577,00:38:07,00:38:11,The plastic-- you know...
578,00:38:11,00:38:14,the plastic that you lay down when you paint a house...
579,00:38:14,00:38:18,"the kind of plastic that you, uh..."
580,00:38:18,00:38:19,wrap a dead body in...
581,00:38:19,00:38:23,the plastic that we found your fingerprints on.
582,00:38:29,00:38:31,Let me tell you what I think happened.
583,00:38:32,00:38:33,Take what you want.
584,00:38:33,00:38:34,I don't care.
585,00:38:34,00:38:36,I've moved on.
586,00:38:36,00:38:42,"What do you think you're going to do, just paint me out of your life? Just take what you want and get out."
587,00:38:42,00:38:44,I'll tell you what I want.
588,00:39:18,00:39:19,Damn it!
589,00:39:19,00:39:21,God!
590,00:39:22,00:39:24,"So, what did you forget?"
591,00:39:26,00:39:31,"You wouldn't believe it, but I forgot to lock the shed."
592,00:39:31,00:39:35,BRASS: And when you came back out your car was gone.
593,00:39:35,00:39:37,Yeah.
594,00:39:37,00:39:39,I don't know who took it.
595,00:39:39,00:39:41,We do.
596,00:39:41,00:39:43,Lori! Lori!
597,00:39:57,00:40:02,"You know, that reminds me-- I got to remember to take Greg Sanders to lunch."
598,00:40:02,00:40:05,He did a nice job sniffing out those peanuts.
599,00:40:05,00:40:07,"Yeah, he did."
600,00:40:16,00:40:18,We were waiting for you.
601,00:40:18,00:40:19,Meet Ronnie Connors.
602,00:40:19,00:40:20,Where's his attorney?
603,00:40:20,00:40:23,What are you talking to him about my business?
604,00:40:23,00:40:24,Ask me.
605,00:40:26,00:40:28,Where's your lawyer?
606,00:40:28,00:40:30,Ask him.
607,00:40:42,00:40:43,How's your plaque?
608,00:40:43,00:40:45,My what?
609,00:40:45,00:40:46,Your teeth.
610,00:40:46,00:40:49,"I mean, how many toothbrushes does a guy need?"
611,00:40:51,00:40:56,"Apparently, for you it's as many as it takes to make the perfect shank."
612,00:40:56,00:40:58,"Let me tell you something, breeze."
613,00:40:58,00:41:02,"I'm LA County/Slauson payback Crip, cuz."
614,00:41:02,00:41:07,I got a lot of offspring up in here-- black as night.
615,00:41:07,00:41:10,They answer to me becauseI'mthe macaroni.
616,00:41:10,00:41:13,"I mean, seriously..."
617,00:41:13,00:41:16,you have any idea who you're talking to?
618,00:41:16,00:41:18,Yeah.
619,00:41:28,00:41:30,"So, why don't I have to testify?"
620,00:41:30,00:41:33,The evidence will testify for you.
621,00:41:33,00:41:38,Ronnie Connors... bought a toothbrush and some rubber bands at the commissary.
622,00:41:38,00:41:42,He didn't know it but that's the last shank he'll ever make.
623,00:41:42,00:41:44,How'd you know it was RC's?
624,00:41:44,00:41:48,Before he made the shank he shaved with the same razor.
625,00:41:48,00:41:51,His DNA was all over the blade.
626,00:41:51,00:41:52,"Oh, God."
627,00:41:58,00:42:00,"I owe you, man."
628,00:42:01,00:42:04,It's not me you have to thank.
629,00:42:22,00:42:24,"I love you, Grandpa."
630,00:42:30,00:42:32,"You're all I got, James."
631,00:42:34,00:42:35,"You're everything to me, you hear?"
632,00:43:04,00:43:06,I thought you said we were grabbing a beer.
633,00:43:06,00:43:08,"We are, after this."
634,00:43:08,00:43:11,"Aw, Grissom, you know, this is your thing. Ah-ah-ah."
635,00:43:11,00:43:15,Every nine years and 34 days I feel like sharing.
636,00:43:15,00:43:16,You'll like it.
637,00:43:16,00:43:18,It cleanses you.
638,00:43:20,00:43:23,Cleanses me?
639,00:43:23,00:43:26,Whatever happened to my evaluation?
640,00:43:26,00:43:28,You're sitting in it.
