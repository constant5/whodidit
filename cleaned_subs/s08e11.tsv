0	00:01:59	00:02:01	Welcome to PBR Finals in Las Vegas.
1	00:02:03	00:02:07	For two weekends, we have 45 riders competing in a race for the world title.
2	00:02:07	00:02:10	The world champion goes home with a million bucks.
3	00:02:10	00:02:11	You want to talk about pressure?
4	00:02:11	00:02:13	It's all in Las Vegas.
5	00:02:13	00:02:22	Next up, Cody Latshaw riding Wintwister, one of the finest bovine athletes in the world today-- a champ among champions.
6	00:02:42	00:02:50	Ladies and gentlemen, right in your seat, right now, do what you can, spiritually, to help Cody.
7	00:02:50	00:02:55	Cody. Hey, Cody, you all right?
8	00:02:55	00:02:57	You okay? Get a stretcher.
9	00:02:57	00:02:58	Get a stretcher!
10	00:02:58	00:02:59	I don't need a stretcher.
11	00:02:59	00:03:01	You sure? I'm okay.
12	00:03:01	00:03:02	Just give me a hand.
13	00:03:02	00:03:04	All right. Here we go.
14	00:03:09	00:03:11	Re-ride!
15	00:03:15	00:03:18	This is why we call him Lazarus, ladies and gentlemen.
16	00:03:18	00:03:20	Knock him down, and he rises again.
17	00:03:20	00:03:22	What an athlete!
18	00:03:22	00:03:24	What a hero!
19	00:03:34	00:03:36	So, who found him?
20	00:03:36	00:03:38	Security.
21	00:03:38	00:03:40	We have a tough time finding guys to wrangle a bull.
22	00:03:40	00:03:44	Cowboys like to party when they come to Vegas.
23	00:03:44	00:03:46	Did you see anything?
24	00:03:46	00:03:49	No, we just put the bull back in the pen.
25	00:03:49	00:03:51	Ty Murray, PBR president.
26	00:03:51	00:03:53	And seven-time world champ.
27	00:03:53	00:03:54	Okay, Dustin.
28	00:03:54	00:03:55	Jim Brass, Vegas PD.
29	00:03:55	00:03:57	Nice to meet you. Gil Grissom, Crime Lab.
30	00:03:57	00:03:58	Nice to meet you.
31	00:03:58	00:04:00	What can you tell me about this guy?
32	00:04:00	00:04:02	Cody Latshaw, a real institution.
33	00:04:02	00:04:05	Most guys his age hung up their rope a long time ago.
34	00:04:05	00:04:06	What about the bull?
35	00:04:06	00:04:10	Wintwister-- he threw Cody earlier tonight, but he got up and was fine.
36	00:04:11	00:04:12	He even asked for a re-ride.
37	00:04:12	00:04:16	Re-ride? Well, if a bull doesn't buck good enough, they can ask to get on another one.
38	00:04:16	00:04:17	That wasn't the case.
39	00:04:17	00:04:19	Wintwister had a good day.
40	00:04:19	00:04:23	Cody must not have been in his right mind to think he'd get a second shot.
41	00:04:24	00:04:26	Is this the rope they tie around the bull?
42	00:04:26	00:04:27	That's one of them.
43	00:04:27	00:04:28	That's the bull rope.
44	00:04:32	00:04:34	Looks like it's got rosin on it.
45	00:04:34	00:04:37	Yeah, it helps the rope stick to the glove so they can get a good grip.
46	00:04:37	00:04:39	Do all the riders wear a glove?
47	00:04:40	00:04:40	Yes, sir.
48	00:04:41	00:04:44	He's not wearing one.
49	00:04:46	00:04:48	Guy was living the American dream.
50	00:04:50	00:04:52	Every kid wants to grow up to be a cowboy.
51	00:04:53	00:04:55	Not a dead cowboy.
52	00:05:34	00:05:35	Catherine.
53	00:05:35	00:05:38	Hi.
54	00:05:38	00:05:41	PBR Sports Medicine just sent this over.
55	00:05:41	00:05:44	Taken after Cody's fall in competition.
56	00:05:46	00:05:48	Hmm.
57	00:05:48	00:05:52	He was held together by every kind of hardware but roofing nails.
58	00:05:52	00:05:53	I can relate.
59	00:05:54	00:05:55	Yeah, it's a violent sport.
60	00:05:55	00:05:56	Check out his hand.
61	00:05:56	00:06:00	Riders live with constant injuries and pain.
62	00:06:00	00:06:06	They always get on that next bull and try like hell to hang on for the next eight seconds.
63	00:06:06	00:06:08	You sound like a fan.
64	00:06:08	00:06:10	I used to date a bull rider.
65	00:06:11	00:06:12	Cowboy up.
66	00:06:12	00:06:13	Here you go.
67	00:06:13	00:06:15	Hey. These are the ones I took.
68	00:06:15	00:06:17	Thank you.
69	00:06:17	00:06:19	So there's just a few bills in his pockets.
70	00:06:19	00:06:21	David, why don't you give me a hand here? Oh, sure.
71	00:06:21	00:06:23	Some guys keep valuables in their boots.
72	00:06:28	00:06:31	Cody's little doggies are right fragrant.
73	00:06:31	00:06:33	Catherine, take a look at this.
74	00:06:36	00:06:43	This X-ray shows he walked away from his earlier fall with a hairline fracture of the C1 vertebra.
75	00:06:49	00:06:59	In bull riding, the rider's spine must sustain vertical, horizontal and diagonal thrust, together if they put tremendous force onto the spinal column.
76	00:07:14	00:07:16	That guy was a walking time bomb.
77	00:07:16	00:07:21	Any trauma with sufficient force would snap that vertebra and sever the spinal cord.
78	00:07:21	00:07:23	It did.
79	00:07:23	00:07:27	The film David just took shows a complete fracture.
80	00:07:28	00:07:29	That's your COD.
81	00:07:30	00:07:32	Consistent with getting thrown a second time.
82	00:07:32	00:07:34	Hey!
83	00:07:34	00:07:37	You got anything to do with taking my bull off tomorrow's day sheet?
84	00:07:37	00:07:39	Do you own the bull?
85	00:07:39	00:07:40	Yeah, I'm Nancy Twicker.
86	00:07:40	00:07:42	And I want my bull in the finals.
87	00:07:42	00:07:43	The more he bucks, the more he's worth.
88	00:07:43	00:07:47	So whatever you got to do to clear him, get it done.
89	00:07:47	00:07:50	Your bull gave Cody Latshaw a pretty brutal beating.
90	00:07:50	00:07:51	It's not the bull's fault.
91	00:07:51	00:07:54	I blame Cody for taking him out after hours.
92	00:07:54	00:07:57	Is it true that some riders tie the bull's testicles to get them to buck more?
93	00:07:57	00:08:00	Well, sure, we always want the bulls to buck.
94	00:08:00	00:08:01	That's why we tie a flank strap across their back.
95	00:08:02	00:08:03	They're trying to shake it off.
96	00:08:03	00:08:04	Think about it.
97	00:08:04	00:08:08	If I tied a rope around your testicles, would you feel like jumping up and down?
98	00:08:10	00:08:14	Could a guy get a bull out of this chute without any help?
99	00:08:14	00:08:23	Well, one guy could get a bull all the way to the bucking chute, sure, but well, then he'd have to tie on the bull rope and the flank strap. Then he'd have to get on the bull. And open the gate.
100	00:08:23	00:08:25	Not without help.
101	00:08:25	00:08:27	The chute only opens from the outside.
102	00:08:30	00:08:32	I'm going to need to process your bull.
103	00:08:33	00:08:35	Can you do it in eight seconds?
104	00:08:35	00:08:38	Even confined like this, these are not the most cooperative creatures.
105	00:08:38	00:08:40	So if my flank man says get back, you jump.
106	00:08:40	00:08:42	Hey, Cash.
107	00:08:42	00:08:44	Howdy, Cash Dooley.
108	00:08:44	00:08:47	And my name's about the only cash I got.
109	00:08:47	00:08:49	And this is Wintwister?
110	00:08:51	00:08:52	What, uh...
111	00:08:52	00:08:55	What would be the safest way for me to handle his hooves?
112	00:08:55	00:08:57	There ain't one. Too dangerous.
113	00:08:57	00:08:58	He's a kicker.
114	00:08:58	00:09:01	Do you think I could get him to step on something?
115	00:09:01	00:09:04	Sure. But you better let me do the bending.
116	00:09:11	00:09:13	Think you could get him to step on this?
117	00:09:15	00:09:16	Cash knows bulls like nobody.
118	00:09:16	00:09:21	Heck, before these kids could even walk, they're out riding sheep, then calves and baby bulls.
119	00:09:21	00:09:25	And finally these one-ton, back-jerkin' snot-slingin' monsters.
120	00:09:25	00:09:29	Now, they get all busted up and quit ridin', but they just can't quit these animals.
121	00:09:38	00:09:40	Cotton fiber.
122	00:09:42	00:09:45	Appears to be bloodstained.
123	00:09:45	00:09:47	I need another piece for comparison.
124	00:09:49	00:09:51	Forget how to use the scissors?
125	00:09:51	00:09:54	Put your fingers in the holes and squeeze.
126	00:09:55	00:09:57	Yes, ma'am.
127	00:10:08	00:10:10	This looks like semen.
128	00:10:10	00:10:12	Cowboy had a roll in the hay.
129	00:10:13	00:10:18	Either he's messy or, uh, we could have a Brokeback Mountain situation.
130	00:10:18	00:10:19	Oh, God, that movie made me cry.
131	00:10:19	00:10:21	Me, too.
132	00:10:22	00:10:26	You know, it takes a big man to admit that.
133	00:10:26	00:10:28	And I am that man.
134	00:10:28	00:10:30	You don't say?
135	00:10:30	00:10:34	Fibers from the bull are consistent with Cody's shirt.
136	00:10:36	00:10:38	Looks like Wintwister's a killer.
137	00:10:51	00:10:59	Found her body on patrol, called in the 401AB, apparent fatal.
138	00:10:59	00:11:02	If there were any eyewitnesses, they didn't stick around.
139	00:11:02	00:11:05	Okay, thanks.
140	00:11:17	00:11:20	Here's the point of impact.
141	00:11:22	00:11:24	Threw her that far, he must have been going at least...
142	00:11:24	00:11:26	45.
143	00:11:26	00:11:29	Tiffany Rigdon, 27, local.
144	00:11:29	00:11:31	I'll run her for you.
145	00:11:31	00:11:33	Thanks.
146	00:11:39	00:11:42	Radiator fluid.
147	00:11:43	00:11:46	Bunch of empty liquor miniatures.
148	00:11:48	00:11:51	Card key from Pike's Gambling Hall.
149	00:11:53	00:11:56	Hit-and-run.
150	00:11:56	00:11:58	Hit back there...
151	00:12:03	00:12:05	...ran over here.
152	00:12:32	00:12:35	RO is Cody Latshaw-- Durant, Oklahoma.
153	00:12:35	00:12:37	Isn't that Grissom's dead cowboy?
154	00:12:37	00:12:39	Yeah.
155	00:12:39	00:12:41	Boy, he had a hell of a night.
156	00:12:41	00:12:44	He gets humiliated...
157	00:12:45	00:12:48	...hits a pedestrian...
158	00:12:50	00:12:56	...he ditches the car, walks a couple of blocks to the arena, joyrides a bull, and then ends up getting stomped to death?
159	00:12:58	00:13:03	Here's another card key from Pike's Gambling Hall right here.
160	00:13:08	00:13:12	First one's for room 810, registered to Cody Latshaw.
161	00:13:13	00:13:15	Here you go.
162	00:13:18	00:13:22	Second one's also to room 810.
163	00:13:27	00:13:30	Cody knew the girl he ran over.
164	00:13:35	00:13:40	Lucky for us, housekeeping's a little slow on the uptake.
165	00:13:51	00:13:53	Riding glove.
166	00:13:53	00:13:57	So he wasn't planning on re-riding Wintwister when he left here.
167	00:13:57	00:14:01	Threw back a bunch of beers, some liquor.
168	00:14:01	00:14:04	I don't see any drugs.
169	00:14:04	00:14:05	Bed looks used.
170	00:14:05	00:14:07	Maybe he partied with Tiffany.
171	00:14:09	00:14:11	Bet it cost him.
172	00:14:11	00:14:12	I ran her priors.
173	00:14:12	00:14:14	She's got a couple for solicitation.
174	00:14:15	00:14:20	I can't help now but wonder what your brown eyes were concealing.
175	00:14:20	00:14:24	They just showed me reflections of all that I was feeling...
176	00:14:26	00:14:30	Our bodies close together like my ride hand in my glove.
177	00:14:31	00:14:36	Hearts pounding with excitement And, dare I say it, love.
178	00:14:38	00:14:40	Nobody ever wrote me a poem.
179	00:14:40	00:14:41	I know I'll never own you.
180	00:14:42	00:14:48	It's your nature to run free, but I pray the Lord above that one day you'll come back to me.
181	00:14:49	00:14:51	That's sweet.
182	00:14:51	00:14:53	By the time you read this, I'll be married.
183	00:14:54	00:14:56	He's a great guy.
184	00:14:56	00:15:00	Honest, Cody, I'll always be thankful for everything you did for me.
185	00:15:00	00:15:02	Love, Tiffany.
186	00:15:02	00:15:04	Sounds like it was more than a money relationship.
187	00:15:04	00:15:07	Mm-hmm.
188	00:15:07	00:15:09	Broken bones-- he gets up and rides again.
189	00:15:09	00:15:13	Broken heart and he's a killer.
190	00:15:17	00:15:26	Then we'll ride off in glory until our time is done And I will be your hero, your cowboy in the sun.
191	00:15:26	00:15:28	It's not Shakespeare.
192	00:15:28	00:15:29	I'm actually a fan of cowboy poetry.
193	00:15:30	00:15:30	Are you really?
194	00:15:31	00:15:35	Yeah, it's just a way of organizing your thoughts and feelings so that you can make sense of them.
195	00:15:35	00:15:39	Well, it sounds like Cody was trying to make sense out of his girl leaving him.
196	00:15:39	00:15:42	Yeah, well, poetry can help you with that, too.
197	00:15:45	00:15:53	Rib fractures, multiple lacerations, pulmonary contusions, lacerated aorta, lacerated liver.
198	00:15:53	00:15:55	I could go on, but you get the idea.
199	00:15:55	00:15:58	COD was multiple blunt force trauma.
200	00:15:58	00:16:01	Right, but not all of it was from the hit-and-run.
201	00:16:02	00:16:05	You see the coloration of the bruises?
202	00:16:05	00:16:06	Yellowish.
203	00:16:06	00:16:11	They're from an event at least 12 hours before the accident.
204	00:16:11	00:16:15	Maybe Cody had rejection issues.
205	00:16:15	00:16:17	Could be why she was leaving him.
206	00:16:19	00:16:23	Lot of tools back here.
207	00:16:23	00:16:25	It's an equipment- intensive sport.
208	00:16:41	00:16:44	What have we here?
209	00:16:45	00:16:47	Some kind of cattle prod?
210	00:16:47	00:16:48	They don't use those in professional bull riding.
211	00:16:48	00:16:51	Buckaroos, have you seen Catherine?
212	00:16:51	00:16:56	'Cause I just got the results from that semen stain on Cody Latshaw's jeans.
213	00:16:56	00:16:57	Come up with a match?
214	00:16:57	00:17:00	I did. I had to run an Ouchterlony test on it.
215	00:17:00	00:17:02	So not from a human donor?
216	00:17:02	00:17:04	No... no.
217	00:17:04	00:17:05	Bovine.
218	00:17:05	00:17:07	Yeah...
219	00:17:07	00:17:11	I took a psychobiology class once and we studied a very interesting case.
220	00:17:11	00:17:18	Okay, there was a guy, he lived on a farm, and literally the only way that this guy could get sexually satisfied was when he was with livestock.
221	00:17:18	00:17:19	That's okay. I'm good.
222	00:17:19	00:17:22	Well, see, apparently, the whole thing started one night because he was in the barn-- it started snowing.
223	00:17:23	00:17:24	He got stuck in there.
224	00:17:24	00:17:29	He couldn't make his way back to the farmhouse, so he decided that he would try and stay warm...
225	00:17:29	00:17:31	well, with a sheep.
226	00:17:33	00:17:35	But then the horses were jealous, so...
227	00:17:35	00:17:38	you know, and I think there was a cow in there as well.
228	00:17:38	00:17:39	You know, I think we got the picture.
229	00:17:39	00:17:40	I wish I didn't.
230	00:17:46	00:17:48	I think I know what this is for.
231	00:17:49	00:17:52	It's called an electroejaculator.
232	00:17:52	00:17:54	It's used on bulls that have back trouble.
233	00:17:54	00:17:57	It looks, uh... pretty persuasive.
234	00:17:57	00:17:58	Yeah.
235	00:17:58	00:18:00	So, uh, was Cody helping you collect from Wintwister?
236	00:18:00	00:18:01	Hell, no.
237	00:18:01	00:18:04	First of all, you don't collect during competition.
238	00:18:04	00:18:06	Right, right, so like an athlete before a game.
239	00:18:06	00:18:07	Now you're talking.
240	00:18:07	00:18:10	And when I do collect, I bring a service out to the ranch.
241	00:18:10	00:18:12	You know, one collection from that old boy gives you about...
242	00:18:12	00:18:13	500 breeding units.
243	00:18:13	00:18:15	At a hundred bucks a pop, you do the math.
244	00:18:16	00:18:20	Well, if the stuff is so valuable, maybe Cody was doing a little moonlighting, you know, collecting on his own, making a little extra money.
245	00:18:20	00:18:22	Cattle rustling? No, not Cody.
246	00:18:22	00:18:24	We found bull semen on his jeans.
247	00:18:25	00:18:26	Cody wouldn't steal from me.
248	00:18:26	00:18:30	Besides, it's a two-person job, no matter which method you use.
249	00:18:30	00:18:31	There's more than one?
250	00:18:31	00:18:36	In addition to your electroejaculation, you got what's called an artificial vagina.
251	00:18:36	00:18:38	Now, you get a teaser animal in there, like a steer.
252	00:18:39	00:18:42	See, bulls go homosexual in captivity.
253	00:18:42	00:18:46	You get that bull to mount that steer, then you get that AV in there right before th... Yeah, I get the point.
254	00:18:47	00:18:49	Do you know this girl?
255	00:18:49	00:18:50	We think she's Cody's girlfriend.
256	00:18:50	00:18:53	Yeah.
257	00:18:53	00:18:57	I thought he had a new girlfriend in Vegas from the way his mood was changing.
258	00:18:57	00:19:01	She's younger, probably... does whatever he says.
259	00:19:01	00:19:06	Mm-hmm. Listen, if you need anything else, I'll be at the arena all day.
260	00:19:06	00:19:08	I thought Wintwister didn't compete tonight.
261	00:19:08	00:19:13	Well, Captain, I'm not a one-bull kind of gal.
262	00:19:16	00:19:19	Here you are, sir.
263	00:19:19	00:19:20	Can I help you?
264	00:19:20	00:19:23	Saw a woman get killed last night.
265	00:19:23	00:19:25	Hey, Cath, listen, it's Jim.
266	00:19:25	00:19:29	We got an eyewitness confirming 21 A.M.
267	00:19:29	00:19:32	Well, that's over an hour after Cody's body was found.
268	00:19:32	00:19:34	Thanks, Jim.
269	00:19:34	00:19:35	Hey.
270	00:19:35	00:19:38	I got prints from the truck, but half of them are Cody's.
271	00:19:38	00:19:39	Well, it is his truck.
272	00:19:39	00:19:41	So... get this.
273	00:19:41	00:19:45	There's a witness that puts Tiffany's TOD after Cody's.
274	00:19:45	00:19:46	He didn't kill her.
275	00:19:46	00:19:48	I think he had a partner.
276	00:19:48	00:19:53	There's a set of unknowns both on the truck and on the, uh... electro-love machine.
277	00:19:53	00:20:01	So... say this partner thought Tiffany knew something about the semen-rustling and he ran her over to keep her quiet.
278	00:20:01	00:20:03	So who's the partner?
279	00:20:03	00:20:05	We've got Cody's phone.
280	00:20:05	00:20:07	Find out who he's been talking to.
281	00:20:09	00:20:13	Most of Cody's calls were to a number in Durant, Oklahoma.
282	00:20:13	00:20:15	He lived on the family ranch.
283	00:20:15	00:20:19	He was probably letting his folks know how he was doing in the finals.
284	00:20:19	00:20:24	All other calls were to PBR staff and to Tiffany.
285	00:20:24	00:20:26	What about her records?
286	00:20:26	00:20:27	Well, they're a little more interesting.
287	00:20:27	00:20:28	Check out...
288	00:20:28	00:20:30	last night.
289	00:20:35	00:20:39	A dozen calls after midnight from Eric Hong.
290	00:20:39	00:20:41	Precious Ricky.
291	00:20:43	00:20:44	You know this guy?
292	00:20:44	00:20:51	Yeah, he's a pimp, 00 A.M., like he knew she was already dead.
293	00:20:57	00:21:00	All right, I don't want nobody hitting me.
294	00:21:00	00:21:01	All right?
295	00:21:01	00:21:02	Nobody's going to hit you, Rick.
296	00:21:03	00:21:04	Good.
297	00:21:04	00:21:06	This is about Tiffany Rigdon.
298	00:21:06	00:21:10	Beautiful girl, skin like butterfly wings.
299	00:21:10	00:21:12	Did you beat her up?
300	00:21:12	00:21:15	I'm a lover, brother.
301	00:21:15	00:21:16	Let me tell you something, man.
302	00:21:16	00:21:18	You play around with me, I'm gonna throw your ass in jail.
303	00:21:18	00:21:19	You feel me?
304	00:21:19	00:21:22	Yeah, I feel you.
305	00:21:22	00:21:24	Good.
306	00:21:24	00:21:28	So she said she was leaving you, going to get married, right?
307	00:21:29	00:21:32	Oh, come on, at least admit I'm right about that.
308	00:21:32	00:21:34	Yeah, okay, sure.
309	00:21:34	00:21:37	Is that when you took her boyfriend's truck and ran her over?
310	00:21:37	00:21:39	Wait. Wait.
311	00:21:39	00:21:42	you get the boyfriend and a little revenge to boot.
312	00:21:42	00:21:43	I mean, it's...
313	00:21:43	00:21:49	Okay, I didn't like the girl quitting on me, especially during one of my busiest freaking weeks of the year, and I wanted to talk her out of it.
314	00:21:49	00:21:50	talk?
315	00:21:50	00:21:52	No, I couldn't even talk to her.
316	00:21:52	00:21:54	She wouldn't take my calls, so I quit trying.
317	00:21:54	00:21:57	Where were you making all these phone calls from?
318	00:21:57	00:21:58	From a country-western bar.
319	00:21:58	00:22:00	I hit them all when the cowboys come to town.
320	00:22:00	00:22:02	Mm-hmm, all right, all right, I'll check it out.
321	00:22:02	00:22:05	Yeah, you do that, please.
322	00:22:05	00:22:07	I didn't take you for a country music fan.
323	00:22:07	00:22:10	Yee-ha.
324	00:23:52	00:23:54	Shotgun.
325	00:23:54	00:23:56	At close range.
326	00:23:56	00:24:01	Would have been pretty loud, but everything is in a place like this.
327	00:24:01	00:24:04	Cowboys, cattle rustling, and now a shooting at the dance hall.
328	00:24:05	00:24:06	Welcome to the Wild West.
329	00:24:06	00:24:10	So, Coco, you didn't see anyone threaten Precious Ricky?
330	00:24:10	00:24:14	I was trying to put the nine ball in the corner pocket.
331	00:24:14	00:24:15	Yeah, right.
332	00:24:15	00:24:16	You know this girl?
333	00:24:16	00:24:17	That's Tiffany.
334	00:24:18	00:24:19	She got married last night.
335	00:24:19	00:24:20	Lucky bitch.
336	00:24:20	00:24:22	Do you know who the groom was?
337	00:24:23	00:24:26	Troy? Troy something?
338	00:24:26	00:24:27	Know anything about him?
339	00:24:28	00:24:29	No. She just met him.
340	00:24:29	00:24:31	Sweet kid.
341	00:24:31	00:24:35	He, uh, took her side when that cowgirl trash got all up in her face.
342	00:24:56	00:24:58	Hey, cowboy. Hey.
343	00:24:58	00:24:59	Like that hat.
344	00:24:59	00:25:01	Thank you.
345	00:25:01	00:25:03	What's underneath don't look too bad, either.
346	00:25:05	00:25:06	I'm Tiffany.
347	00:25:06	00:25:09	I'm Troy.
348	00:25:10	00:25:12	We know what you are.
349	00:25:12	00:25:15	Whore. Excuse me, Miss, but we're having a private conversation here.
350	00:25:15	00:25:18	Why pay that cow when others would give you the milk for free?
351	00:25:19	00:25:20	I think you owe her an apology.
352	00:25:20	00:25:23	We don't want your kind in here. Oh, yeah?
353	00:26:36	00:26:39	She came back last night and said that she was going to marry the guy.
354	00:26:39	00:26:41	It's kind of impulsive, isn't it?
355	00:26:41	00:26:51	Hey, Cop, somebody says they want to marry you, take care of you, pay all your bills, give you a nice place to live, why would you even wait?
356	00:26:51	00:26:55	It's always crazy busy with the cowboys in this town.
357	00:26:55	00:26:58	You know, I think it's being around all these bucking bulls.
358	00:26:58	00:26:59	Gets them all worked up.
359	00:26:59	00:27:01	Brings out their animal instinct to mate.
360	00:27:02	00:27:07	According to the marriage bureau, Troy Birkhart and Tiffany Rigdon got their license just before midnight.
361	00:27:07	00:27:10	And then, what, Troy came over to your chapel to set up the service?
362	00:27:10	00:27:12	Yeah.
363	00:27:12	00:27:14	He said his girl was changing at the hotel.
364	00:27:14	00:27:16	It's the old story, you know.
365	00:27:16	00:27:21	She gets cold feet, he can't face the truth, keeps thinking she's running late.
366	00:27:49	00:27:52	Ooh, Vegas!
367	00:27:54	00:27:56	How long did he wait?
368	00:27:56	00:27:58	Hours.
369	00:27:58	00:28:00	He shows me the prize buckles he's won for bull riding.
370	00:28:00	00:28:03	Tells me he's going on the pro tour next year.
371	00:28:03	00:28:05	The little ranch they're going to settle down on...
372	00:28:05	00:28:07	where the wind comes sweeping down the plains.
373	00:28:07	00:28:09	And what time did he end up leaving?
374	00:28:10	00:28:11	00 a.m.
375	00:28:11	00:28:19	Frankly, if she's not going to make a go of it, I say, better now than down the road before all the lawyers and the property and all that mess.
376	00:28:19	00:28:22	Wedding chapel's only a couple blocks from the crime scene.
377	00:28:22	00:28:24	30. Mm-hmm.
378	00:28:24	00:28:26	Killed?
379	00:28:26	00:28:29	Yeah, on the way to her own wedding.
380	00:28:29	00:28:32	I'll get a BOLO out on Troy's vehicle.
381	00:28:44	00:28:49	...1000 Chestnut, a 918X.
382	00:28:49	00:28:51	1000 Chestnut, a 918X.
383	00:28:53	00:29:03	Attention, all officers attempt to locate yellow Ford Ranger 2005 pickup, Texas plates Charlie Nora Baker Queen Seven Five Zero.
384	00:29:03	00:29:09	Troy Birkhart, white male adult, wanted in connection with a 415A, Eric Hong homicide.
385	00:29:11	00:29:13	Dispatch, this is C-21 Brown.
386	00:29:13	00:29:18	The pickup that you're looking for is on level 3 of the PD garage.
387	00:29:18	00:29:22	Suspect is in the vehicle, armed and agitated.
388	00:29:22	00:29:25	suspect is armed and agitated.
389	00:29:25	00:29:27	Copy, C-21.
390	00:29:27	00:29:28	Units responding.
391	00:29:28	00:29:30	Code Three.
392	00:29:45	00:29:47	Hey, buddy.
393	00:29:47	00:29:50	Hey. You must be Troy, huh?
394	00:29:50	00:29:52	(elevator bell dings) Just be cool, okay?
395	00:29:52	00:29:54	All right?
396	00:29:54	00:30:00	Hey, Troy, listen to me.
397	00:30:02	00:30:04	We don't want anyone getting hurt, okay?
398	00:30:04	00:30:05	So put the gun down.
399	00:30:05	00:30:08	Come out of the truck with your hands up.
400	00:30:08	00:30:10	Put the gun down, Troy.
401	00:30:10	00:30:12	Just let it fall away.
402	00:30:12	00:30:14	Now.
403	00:30:14	00:30:17	He moves on that gun, don't wait.
404	00:30:17	00:30:19	Hang on, Jim.
405	00:30:19	00:30:21	Let me... Let me talk to him real quick.
406	00:30:21	00:30:24	Okay, but we're not taking any chances.
407	00:30:24	00:30:26	Yeah, yeah, okay.
408	00:30:26	00:30:30	Hey, Troy, when's the last time you got down to Big Bend?
409	00:30:30	00:30:32	Huh?
410	00:30:32	00:30:34	You-You got the plate frame.
411	00:30:35	00:30:37	Man, I used to go to summer camp down there.
412	00:30:37	00:30:39	Stay back!
413	00:30:39	00:30:41	Hey, take it easy, Troy.
414	00:30:41	00:30:44	Look, I got no weapon on me.
415	00:30:44	00:30:48	Okay, I just want to talk to you for a second.
416	00:30:48	00:30:50	I killed somebody!
417	00:30:50	00:30:52	Yeah, I know.
418	00:30:52	00:30:58	You came out to Vegas, and you got in over your head, but this is getting out of control.
419	00:30:58	00:31:03	If you don't put that gun down, these cops are going to start shooting, and that could turn out very bad for both of us.
420	00:31:03	00:31:05	You know what I mean? (breathing shallowly)
421	00:31:05	00:31:08	I'm just... I'm just doing the right thing.
422	00:31:08	00:31:12	Making sure you know it was me.
423	00:31:12	00:31:14	And I'll pay for what I did.
424	00:31:14	00:31:16	Eye for an eye, man.
425	00:31:16	00:31:17	Hey.
426	00:31:17	00:31:20	Stay back! I'll do it, I swear!
427	00:31:20	00:31:21	I'll do it, I swear!
428	00:31:21	00:31:23	No, Troy, just wait. Hang on now. Listen to me.
429	00:31:23	00:31:25	I know about Tiffany.
430	00:31:25	00:31:28	I know why she stood you up at the wedding chapel.
431	00:31:32	00:31:34	That Ricky.
432	00:31:37	00:31:39	Thought he owned her.
433	00:31:42	00:31:43	Hey!
434	00:31:44	00:31:45	Hey, what you doing, man?
435	00:31:46	00:31:48	He wouldn't let her come.
436	00:31:48	00:31:50	Hey, man, look at me.
437	00:31:50	00:31:52	Look at me.
438	00:31:55	00:31:59	I know she wanted to be there for you.
439	00:31:59	00:32:01	Come on out of there, man.
440	00:32:01	00:32:03	I'll tell you all about it.
441	00:32:03	00:32:05	You don't want to do this.
442	00:32:09	00:32:11	Give me that.
443	00:32:13	00:32:15	Come on, give me that thing.
444	00:32:15	00:32:17	Give it to me.
445	00:32:21	00:32:23	It's going to be okay.
446	00:32:34	00:32:37	You didn't go to summer camp.
447	00:32:37	00:32:40	Missed you around here.
448	00:32:40	00:32:42	Welcome back.
449	00:32:42	00:32:44	Thanks.
450	00:32:50	00:32:55	Well, we know that Cody wasn't alone when he died because he couldn't have opened the bucking chute by himself.
451	00:32:55	00:33:01	And we know that someone other than Cody put the electroejaculation equipment into the truck and drove away.
452	00:33:01	00:33:02	Killing Tiffany.
453	00:33:02	00:33:06	Whoever that someone was knew how to get into the arena, and also how to use the equipment.
454	00:33:08	00:33:09	More cowbell!
455	00:33:14	00:33:15	I processed these for you.
456	00:33:15	00:33:16	And?
457	00:33:16	00:33:18	Well, as you can see, they're bull ropes.
458	00:33:18	00:33:20	These are the kind that the riders hold in their hands.
459	00:33:20	00:33:23	Every rider has one, and they're usually custom-made.
460	00:33:23	00:33:25	I mean, look at that craftsmanship.
461	00:33:25	00:33:27	Yeah, it's exquisite.
462	00:33:27	00:33:29	Now, that's the rope that I collected from Cody's room?
463	00:33:29	00:33:31	Yes, it is.
464	00:33:31	00:33:33	Uh, you'll note that it is polynylon.
465	00:33:34	00:33:39	Now the rope that was collected from the crime scene, though, was long sisal, a type of hemp.
466	00:33:39	00:33:41	Very old-school, and they stopped making it years ago.
467	00:33:41	00:33:46	That means the rope found with Cody's body belonged to someone who's been around for a while.
468	00:33:46	00:33:50	How'd you like to go on a roundup?
469	00:33:54	00:33:56	Hey, Ms. Twicker, how's it going?
470	00:33:56	00:34:01	It'd be going a lot better if my bull Wintwister was in there bucking.
471	00:34:01	00:34:02	Is Cash Dooley here?
472	00:34:02	00:34:04	Cash!
473	00:34:05	00:34:07	Cops want to talk to you.
474	00:34:11	00:34:13	Hey, Mr. Dooley.
475	00:34:13	00:34:15	So, where you staying when you're here in Vegas?
476	00:34:15	00:34:16	Here.
477	00:34:17	00:34:18	He's got the sleeper cab up front.
478	00:34:18	00:34:20	Oh, right here.
479	00:34:20	00:34:24	Is that where you keep your clothes, the rest of your stuff? What's this about?
480	00:34:24	00:34:26	I'd like to take a look in that cab.
481	00:34:26	00:34:27	No. It's private.
482	00:34:27	00:34:29	Now hold on. I own this rig.
483	00:34:29	00:34:33	If you guys want to search it, go ahead.
484	00:35:03	00:35:07	Well, bull semen is property, and that property isn't yours so it's theft.
485	00:35:07	00:35:09	Now, here's what I think happened.
486	00:35:09	00:35:10	You know Cody.
487	00:35:10	00:35:12	He's at the end of his career.
488	00:35:12	00:35:13	He's a little down on his luck.
489	00:35:13	00:35:15	Never put any money aside.
490	00:35:15	00:35:20	Wintwister's output goes for 20 grand a pop on the open market.
491	00:35:20	00:35:26	So you and Cody, you get together, you do the deed and, uh, sell it on the sly.
492	00:35:26	00:35:30	If you knew Cody, you'd know he'd never do anything like that.
493	00:35:30	00:35:33	And then when he told his girlfriend, you took his truck.
494	00:35:33	00:35:35	He always let me borrow his truck.
495	00:35:35	00:35:38	Even when it was to hunt down his girl?
496	00:35:38	00:35:39	Jim?
497	00:35:45	00:35:48	We ran his ten-card against the prints from the truck and the equipment.
498	00:35:48	00:35:50	They don't match. So, there is a third guy?
499	00:35:50	00:35:54	Right. So now, I'm convinced that Cody Latshaw's death was not an accident.
500	00:36:02	00:36:06	Okay, so who is working with you on this, Cash, huh?
501	00:36:06	00:36:10	Who was at the wheel of Cody's truck when you ran down that girl?
502	00:36:10	00:36:12	Was it someone in the arena?
503	00:36:15	00:36:17	What's this, a cowboy code of silence?
504	00:36:17	00:36:24	Look, you want to make me compel fingerprints from everyone working in that arena, I can do that.
505	00:36:33	00:36:36	We got a match!
506	00:36:36	00:36:38	Dustin Lightfoot.
507	00:36:38	00:36:40	Dustin? He's a bullfighter.
508	00:36:49	00:36:54	I got a 440 exiting the east end of the arena. Head him off.
509	00:37:07	00:37:09	Hold it. Freeze. Right there.
510	00:37:09	00:37:11	Don't move.
511	00:37:12	00:37:14	Hands behind your back.
512	00:37:14	00:37:17	Well, howdy, partner.
513	00:37:17	00:37:19	This is a new experience for me.
514	00:37:19	00:37:21	First time I caught me a cattle rustler.
515	00:37:24	00:37:29	Look, Cash and me was just trying to make a little extra money.
516	00:37:29	00:37:34	Then Cody Latshaw came in drunk and itching for a fight.
517	00:37:38	00:37:40	Hey! Quit that!
518	00:37:40	00:37:41	Hey, Cody.
519	00:37:41	00:37:43	You hear me?
520	00:37:43	00:37:46	Cody, relax. Ain't nobody hurtin' anybody. That ain't your property.
521	00:37:46	00:37:48	Cody, Cody, just...
522	00:37:51	00:37:53	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
523	00:37:59	00:38:02	He ain't breathin'.
524	00:38:02	00:38:04	We wasn't tryin' to kill him.
525	00:38:04	00:38:08	He had a cervical fracture from his earlier ride.
526	00:38:08	00:38:09	It didn't take much to snap his spine.
527	00:38:13	00:38:16	Then you tried to make it look like an accident.
528	00:38:28	00:38:31	But you didn't have to run over his girlfriend.
529	00:38:31	00:38:33	That girl we hit-- that was...
530	00:38:33	00:38:34	that was Cody's girlfriend?
531	00:38:34	00:38:37	Yeah, you didn't know?
532	00:38:37	00:38:41	We was racing to get the product to our buyer.
533	00:38:41	00:38:48	And we took Cody's truck 'cause, well, mine ain't air-conditioned and, and he wasn't gonna be usin' it.
534	00:38:56	00:38:58	Well.
535	00:39:04	00:39:07	It's kind of a lonely life, these cowboys, every weekend a different town.
536	00:39:07	00:39:09	That's part of the tradition, you know.
537	00:39:09	00:39:11	Solitary man out there trying to find himself.
538	00:39:11	00:39:14	Yeah, but no man is an island.
539	00:39:14	00:39:19	I mean, obviously, he had feelings for Nancy or he wouldn't have written her that poem.
540	00:39:19	00:39:23	Nancy? I don't know about that. Tiffany's the one that broke his heart. I don't think it's about either girl.
541	00:39:25	00:39:30	I can't help now but wonder what your brown eyes were concealing.
542	00:39:30	00:39:32	Did you read Tiffany's autopsy report?
543	00:39:32	00:39:33	Oh.
544	00:39:33	00:39:35	Yeah, her eyes were blue.
545	00:39:35	00:39:37	So were Nancy's.
546	00:39:37	00:39:39	Then who did he write the poem for?
547	00:39:40	00:39:41	Wintwister.
548	00:39:43	00:39:46	The bull? I think that's why he went back to the arena that night.
549	00:39:47	00:39:52	Wordsworth once wrote, Through love we feel we are greater than we know.
550	00:39:52	00:39:59	My guess is, riding that bull, Cody felt like a greater man.
551	00:40:00	00:40:06	Our bodies close together, like my ride hand in my glove.
552	00:40:06	00:40:10	Hearts pounding with excitement, and dare I say it, love.
553	00:40:10	00:40:14	I know I'll never own you; it's your nature to run free.
554	00:40:14	00:40:18	But I pray the Lord above that one day you'll come back to me.
555	00:40:18	00:40:23	Then we'll ride off in glory until our time is done.
556	00:40:23	00:40:29	And I will be your hero, your cowboy in the sun.
