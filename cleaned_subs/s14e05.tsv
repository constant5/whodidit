0	00:00:11	00:00:16	Welcome to the Premiere, where every player's a star.
1	00:00:21	00:00:24	All right, lucky number seven, here we go!
2	00:00:26	00:00:28	Player has blackjack!
3	00:00:30	00:00:31	No more bets.
4	00:00:31	00:00:32	Roll seven.
5	00:00:32	00:00:36	Come on, red, big money. Come on!
6	00:00:49	00:00:51	What do you think, Dave?
7	00:00:51	00:00:54	Blunt force trauma to the back of the skull.
8	00:00:54	00:00:58	And her liver temp tells me she's been dead about two hours.
9	00:01:00	00:01:01	I.D.?
10	00:01:01	00:01:03	No purse, no cell phone.
11	00:01:03	00:01:04	Nothing.
12	00:01:06	00:01:08	That is an elaborate model.
13	00:01:08	00:01:09	Must be a story there, huh?
14	00:01:09	00:01:11	The Premiere? Yeah.
15	00:01:11	00:01:13	It was Jack Witten's dream.
16	00:01:13	00:01:16	In Jack Witten's house.
17	00:01:16	00:01:17	I've never seen it before.
18	00:01:17	00:01:19	Well, that's because it was never built.
19	00:01:19	00:01:21	I could write a book about the Vegas that never was.
20	00:01:21	00:01:25	So many casinos were imagined and never realized.
21	00:01:25	00:01:28	The most legendary of all, The Premiere.
22	00:01:28	00:01:33	It was Jack Witten's vision to build a casino that resembled his father's old Hollywood movie studio.
23	00:01:33	00:01:38	What happened? Well, like in the movies, the dream ended in scandal.
24	00:01:38	00:01:44	Jack Witten lost his investors when he became the prime suspect in the murder of a young woman.
25	00:01:44	00:01:48	And here we are again.
26	00:01:48	00:01:49	Nice house.
27	00:01:49	00:01:50	Who lives here?
28	00:01:50	00:01:52	Jack Witten. He's an odd duck.
29	00:01:52	00:01:53	He's a modern-day Howard Hughes.
30	00:01:53	00:01:55	That's him, right over there.
31	00:01:55	00:01:57	A former party boy turned recluse.
32	00:01:57	00:02:02	Said he was downstairs in the screening room, fell asleep, came up, found the girl.
33	00:02:02	00:02:04	Tried to revive her. Called 911.
34	00:02:04	00:02:06	Any sign of a break-in? No.
35	00:02:06	00:02:08	Just some wine bottles and drug paraphernalia.
36	00:02:08	00:02:13	You know, it's weird. 14 years ago, we had the guy for the same crime.
37	00:02:13	00:02:14	It's déjà vu all over again.
38	00:02:14	00:02:16	Why? What happened?
39	00:02:16	00:02:18	We didn't have enough evidence to make an arrest.
40	00:02:18	00:02:21	Powerful guy? Connected? Back then.
41	00:02:21	00:02:23	Not anymore. Now he's shuffling around in his slippers.
42	00:02:23	00:02:24	Hey. Hi.
43	00:02:24	00:02:26	It's, uh, pretty ugly in there.
44	00:02:26	00:02:28	Have you seen Sara?
45	00:02:28	00:02:30	Thought she was with you.
46	00:02:56	00:02:58	I think we got the son of a bitch.
47	00:02:58	00:03:00	This had to come from Jack Witten's house.
48	00:03:00	00:03:02	It should be enough for a warrant.
49	00:03:02	00:03:03	Guy like Witten-- might not be that easy.
50	00:03:03	00:03:05	What do you mean?
51	00:03:05	00:03:07	This is Vegas, Sara.
52	00:03:09	00:03:11	Sara? Sara.
53	00:03:14	00:03:15	Got something?
54	00:03:15	00:03:20	A piece of the past. Yeah, I heard about this Witten guy.
55	00:03:20	00:03:24	Are you thinking that the strand has something to do with the crime scene downstairs?
56	00:03:24	00:03:27	Well, 14 years ago...
57	00:03:27	00:03:29	I think the crime scene was right here.
58	00:03:31	00:03:33	Tell me about her. Who--who was she?
59	00:03:33	00:03:37	Darcy Blaine. 18.
60	00:03:37	00:03:38	Jack Witten picked her up at a bar.
61	00:03:38	00:03:41	Security cameras caught them leaving together.
62	00:03:41	00:03:43	He had a thing for younger girls.
63	00:03:43	00:03:45	Darcy was never seen again.
64	00:03:45	00:03:47	They never found her body.
65	00:03:47	00:03:50	You think she was murdered in this room?
66	00:03:51	00:03:54	It was my first high-profile case in Vegas.
67	00:03:54	00:03:57	Catherine was supervising in Grissom's absence.
68	00:03:57	00:03:58	I got it.
69	00:03:58	00:04:00	Witten's the one who got away.
70	00:04:00	00:04:04	I've spent a lot of time with Darcy's family.
71	00:04:04	00:04:07	She was a troubled, wild kid who never had a chance to find her way.
72	00:04:07	00:04:09	I've been there.
73	00:04:09	00:04:14	But we do have a girl that was killed in this house tonight, so, let's focus on that, okay?
74	00:04:14	00:04:17	Yeah, I am.
75	00:04:17	00:04:21	I--I have waited a long time to get into this room.
76	00:04:21	00:04:26	And that girl downstairs might still be alive, if we put Witten away 14 years ago.
77	00:05:03	00:05:06	So this guy Jack Witten was a movie fanatic.
78	00:05:06	00:05:09	Let's see what was playing last night.
79	00:05:09	00:05:11	Okay. Fade in.
80	00:05:11	00:05:13	I'm Jack Witten.
81	00:05:13	00:05:15	Welcome to my sleazy sex pad.
82	00:05:15	00:05:17	Glass of wine? Why not?
83	00:05:17	00:05:20	Glass of wine, little romance...
84	00:05:20	00:05:21	But I get too frisky.
85	00:05:21	00:05:23	You push me away...
86	00:05:23	00:05:24	and drop your wine glass.
87	00:05:30	00:05:31	Hmm.
88	00:05:31	00:05:34	Little bits of cork in there. Hmm.
89	00:05:34	00:05:37	Nice bottle of wine.
90	00:05:37	00:05:39	Did the cork break?
91	00:05:40	00:05:42	Nope. Still intact.
92	00:05:42	00:05:46	Weird. Where'd that come from?
93	00:05:46	00:05:48	I don't know. Okay, so...
94	00:05:48	00:05:50	date is over, I'm out of here.
95	00:05:50	00:05:51	That's the problem.
96	00:05:51	00:05:53	I want you to stay.
97	00:05:53	00:05:56	So Witten and the girl struggle, girl breaks free...
98	00:05:57	00:05:58	Good night.
99	00:06:00	00:06:05	Blood on the lamp is consistent with blunt force trauma.
100	00:06:05	00:06:15	No castoff, which means it was one blow. Okay, so, Witten kills the girl, calls 911, and then, plays it off like an intruder came in while he was sleeping downstairs.
101	00:06:15	00:06:21	Yeah, and that is the worst alibi ever, which, in my experience, sometimes means that it's true.
102	00:06:21	00:06:27	What do you mean? Well, didn't you say that this guy killed a girl and made her body disappear?
103	00:06:27	00:06:28	Why didn't he just do it again?
104	00:06:28	00:06:32	Maybe now he thinks he's untouchable.
105	00:06:33	00:06:35	Seems like old times.
106	00:06:35	00:06:36	Right, Conrad?
107	00:06:36	00:06:40	Some ways, yes, some ways, no... Jack.
108	00:06:40	00:06:44	Uh, Mr. Witten, I'm--I'm not so interested in the past as I am in what happened last night.
109	00:06:44	00:06:46	I already told you.
110	00:06:46	00:06:49	I was watching a film in my basement screening room.
111	00:06:49	00:06:54	Fell asleep to Jane Russell, woke up to a horror show.
112	00:06:54	00:06:57	And you didn't hear anything upstairs?
113	00:06:57	00:06:58	Screening room's soundproofed.
114	00:06:58	00:07:01	And the girl?
115	00:07:01	00:07:02	Never saw her before.
116	00:07:02	00:07:04	I'm so sorry, sir.
117	00:07:04	00:07:09	I just need this to be clear. You're saying that you never even met Darcy? Did I stutter?
118	00:07:09	00:07:10	You heard me.
119	00:07:10	00:07:18	And this time, you people aren't going to find me wasted on some B.S. security video outside a club.
120	00:07:18	00:07:21	Well, we may not have video on you, but...
121	00:07:21	00:07:22	we do have blood on your hands, sir.
122	00:07:22	00:07:24	Yeah, the victim's blood.
123	00:07:24	00:07:26	How do you explain that? I tried to help her.
124	00:07:26	00:07:28	I got her blood on my hands.
125	00:07:28	00:07:29	What do you want me to do?
126	00:07:29	00:07:31	I won't play the sap for you.
127	00:07:31	00:07:34	Humphrey Bogart...
128	00:07:34	00:07:36	Maltese Falcon, right?
129	00:07:36	00:07:37	You know it.
130	00:07:37	00:07:39	A kindred spirit.
131	00:07:39	00:07:42	He played Sam Spade, a private eye everybody was lying to.
132	00:07:42	00:07:47	Yeah, that's me. You've been lying for 14 years.
133	00:07:47	00:07:50	You brought this little girl home, just like you did Darcy Blaine.
134	00:07:50	00:07:54	You know it, and I know it.
135	00:07:54	00:07:56	You don't know anything.
136	00:07:56	00:07:59	You sure as hell don't know me.
137	00:07:59	00:08:01	You never did.
138	00:08:01	00:08:03	Keep smiling, Jack.
139	00:08:03	00:08:10	We didn't get you for Darcy, but I promise you we're gonna nail you for this one.
140	00:08:21	00:08:24	Hello, Conrad.
141	00:08:24	00:08:27	Sara.
142	00:08:27	00:08:30	Here to pull the Darcy Blaine case files?
143	00:08:30	00:08:32	Looks like you beat me to it.
144	00:08:32	00:08:34	Well, great minds obsess alike.
145	00:08:34	00:08:37	Yeah, well, I got a hunch we're obsessing for different reasons.
146	00:08:37	00:08:40	Huh. You're right.
147	00:08:41	00:08:43	I'm really sorry.
148	00:08:43	00:08:46	I should never have taken this case away from you guys.
149	00:08:46	00:08:48	You can't do this, Conrad. Yes, I can.
150	00:08:48	00:08:52	Grissom is at a conference, and you don't have the authority, so this case belongs to day shift now.
151	00:08:52	00:08:55	To me. So you just decided to stop looking at Jack Witten.
152	00:08:55	00:08:57	At least let us get a warrant for Witten's house. No!
153	00:08:57	00:09:04	I'm not gonna waste valuable time and resources on a witch hunt of a prominent man whose family has done so much for this town. God, you are so political.
154	00:09:04	00:09:06	Well, that's an understatement.
155	00:09:06	00:09:10	Look, Darcy Blaine was a drug-addict rich girl slumming in Northtown.
156	00:09:10	00:09:16	You've been looking in the wrong place, Sidle, and you let her--it's time the real pros took over.
157	00:09:16	00:09:18	Feels like a lifetime ago.
158	00:09:18	00:09:21	I was looking in the wrong place or not looking at all.
159	00:09:23	00:09:28	Security cam photos-- Witten and Darcy leaving the club.
160	00:09:28	00:09:30	Later on, in the parking garage.
161	00:09:30	00:09:32	They drove away together in her car.
162	00:09:32	00:09:34	Next morning, it was found on the edge of town.
163	00:09:34	00:09:38	Trace on her tires said it was driven up to Mount Charleston.
164	00:09:38	00:09:40	Notorious body-dump site.
165	00:09:40	00:09:42	There was a lot of blood.
166	00:09:42	00:09:44	Exemplar from Darcy's father proved it was hers.
167	00:09:44	00:09:51	Yeah, and her blood tested positive for cocaine and GHB, so she was definitely roofied.
168	00:09:51	00:09:53	So what do you think happened that night?
169	00:09:53	00:09:54	Well...
170	00:09:54	00:09:57	Darcy Blaine was a drug addict.
171	00:09:57	00:10:02	I think that Witten lured her to his place with the promise of drugs, and then he drugged her.
172	00:10:04	00:10:06	Witten brought her upstairs.
173	00:10:06	00:10:09	Darcy was out of it, but still she had some fight left in her. (Darcy grunts)
174	00:10:11	00:10:14	(grunts) He kills her.
175	00:10:14	00:10:20	Witten takes Darcy's body out in her car and buries her somewhere near Mount Charleston.
176	00:10:20	00:10:22	He made one mistake.
177	00:10:22	00:10:25	He left a carpet fiber in the trunk.
178	00:10:25	00:10:27	Still bloody after all these years.
179	00:10:27	00:10:29	And...
180	00:10:29	00:10:33	the carpet fiber I took from Witten's bedroom.
181	00:10:33	00:10:36	You just get that? Uh-huh.
182	00:10:36	00:10:38	That looks damn close.
183	00:10:38	00:10:41	Hopefully, Hodges can confirm.
184	00:10:46	00:10:47	Hey. Hey.
185	00:10:47	00:10:49	I got a hit on the prints.
186	00:10:49	00:10:55	Jane Doe from Jack Witten's house is Gwenn Onetta.
187	00:10:55	00:10:57	18. High school dropout.
188	00:10:57	00:10:59	Three drug arrests in the last year.
189	00:10:59	00:11:03	Jack Witten's specialty-- young, vulnerable addicts.
190	00:11:03	00:11:06	God, this guy's really gotten under everybody's skin.
191	00:11:06	00:11:08	It's not so much the guy-- it's the loss.
192	00:11:08	00:11:12	Grissom assembled an all-star team here.
193	00:11:12	00:11:13	But ask any pro athlete.
194	00:11:13	00:11:16	Most wins feel the same.
195	00:11:16	00:11:18	It's the tough losses that haunt you.
196	00:11:18	00:11:20	So this is a rematch.
197	00:11:20	00:11:23	Yeah. I like it.
198	00:11:26	00:11:28	Chip of glass in the head wound.
199	00:11:28	00:11:31	Greg said there was a broken wine glass at the scene.
200	00:11:31	00:11:34	This doesn't look like any wine glass.
201	00:11:34	00:11:35	The lamp, maybe? The...
202	00:11:35	00:11:37	The suspected murder weapon?
203	00:11:37	00:11:39	Yeah, that could be.
204	00:11:40	00:11:44	You know, for the record, Morgan, I think you're an all-star too.
205	00:11:45	00:11:47	Thanks, Doc.
206	00:11:54	00:11:57	News on your fibers.
207	00:11:57	00:11:58	Good news? I hope they match.
208	00:11:58	00:12:00	No, sorry.
209	00:12:00	00:12:01	I know you wanted a better answer.
210	00:12:03	00:12:05	Who's that?
211	00:12:05	00:12:06	Walter Blaine, Darcy's father.
212	00:12:06	00:12:08	He heard about Witten and he wants to talk.
213	00:12:08	00:12:11	Calls me every October on the anniversary.
214	00:12:11	00:12:14	Every year, it's the same conversation.
215	00:12:14	00:12:16	Sara, thanks much for your time.
216	00:12:16	00:12:19	Of course. Please, have a seat.
217	00:12:22	00:12:26	So, is today the day we've been waiting for?
218	00:12:26	00:12:29	Well, he's been brought in for questioning.
219	00:12:29	00:12:31	He did it again.
220	00:12:31	00:12:33	That's all I can say, Walter.
221	00:12:33	00:12:36	Please tell me you're gonna get him this time.
222	00:12:36	00:12:40	I promise that I will do everything in my power to get justice for Darcy.
223	00:12:42	00:12:45	She would've been 30 this year.
224	00:12:45	00:12:47	Imagine that.
225	00:12:49	00:12:51	She didn't deserve...
226	00:12:57	00:13:00	Aah... closure's a myth.
227	00:13:00	00:13:03	Doesn't exist.
228	00:13:03	00:13:09	Look, I know that bringing Witten down isn't gonna bring her back.
229	00:13:09	00:13:12	But at least he'll never be able to do it again.
230	00:13:20	00:13:22	What are you doing?
231	00:13:22	00:13:31	The fiber Sara pulled from over there wasn't a match to the bloody fiber from Darcy Blaine's trunk, so I'm thinking it must have come from someplace else.
232	00:13:31	00:13:33	Wow, you guys really don't give up, do you?
233	00:13:33	00:13:35	No, we don't.
234	00:13:35	00:13:39	Especially since we have a pretty good idea about what happened here 14 years ago.
235	00:13:40	00:13:43	It's got to be somewhere.
236	00:13:50	00:13:53	You know, I, uh, get that you want to put this guy away.
237	00:13:53	00:13:57	But don't you think the best way to do that would be to focus on last night?
238	00:14:08	00:14:10	Did you find what you're looking for?
239	00:14:10	00:14:12	No.
240	00:14:12	00:14:14	But maybe something better.
241	00:14:14	00:14:18	It's desiccant gel-- like the kind used in pill bottles to keep the contents dry.
242	00:14:18	00:14:21	Uh-huh. Removes excess moisture.
243	00:14:21	00:14:25	And more cork.
244	00:14:25	00:14:28	Maybe the cork downstairs wasn't from a wine bottle.
245	00:14:30	00:14:33	You know, Jack Witten's father was a huge art collector.
246	00:14:33	00:14:39	And he left everything to Jack, but, I mean, these are all movie posters.
247	00:14:39	00:14:40	Where's the good stuff?
248	00:14:40	00:14:46	What are you getting at? You know, maybe what happened last night didn't start in the bedroom.
249	00:14:46	00:14:47	Maybe it started in a Preservation Room.
250	00:14:47	00:14:51	It's a sealed vault where collectors keep their art.
251	00:14:51	00:14:53	It's climate-controlled.
252	00:14:53	00:14:57	Gel and cork are used in the construction.
253	00:14:57	00:15:00	Well, we've been all over this place and, uh...
254	00:15:00	00:15:02	haven't found a Preservation Room.
255	00:15:02	00:15:04	Hey.
256	00:15:04	00:15:07	There's a break in the baseboard.
257	00:15:12	00:15:14	Whoa.
258	00:15:23	00:15:24	There's someone in there.
259	00:15:24	00:15:26	Need a password.
260	00:15:26	00:15:29	We have to cut through that door.
261	00:15:29	00:15:35	Russell, it's Finn. Send an emergency response team to Witten's house and tell them to bring a plasma torch.
262	00:15:35	00:15:37	We're in.
263	00:15:37	00:15:40	How? 10-22-02, the day The Premiere was supposed to open.
264	00:15:40	00:15:42	(muffled cries) LVPD!
265	00:15:49	00:15:52	It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
266	00:15:52	00:15:55	Please. He tried to kill us.
267	00:15:55	00:15:57	Me and my friend.
268	00:15:57	00:15:59	Is she here? Is Gwen okay?
269	00:16:10	00:16:11	Emily, I'm CSI Russell.
270	00:16:11	00:16:13	And I'm CSI Sidle.
271	00:16:13	00:16:15	Doc says that you're doing a little better.
272	00:16:15	00:16:17	Still feel a little dizzy.
273	00:16:17	00:16:18	We could come back, if you'd like.
274	00:16:18	00:16:20	No. No, I want to help.
275	00:16:20	00:16:21	Good, good.
276	00:16:21	00:16:26	Do you think you can take us through what happened last night?
277	00:16:26	00:16:30	Me and Gwen, we met this old guy at a club.
278	00:16:30	00:16:32	He bought us champagne.
279	00:16:32	00:16:35	I got drunk. Stupid.
280	00:16:35	00:16:37	It's okay.
281	00:16:37	00:16:39	We went back to his place.
282	00:16:39	00:16:41	I needed to use the restroom.
283	00:16:41	00:16:43	Said he'd show me.
284	00:16:43	00:16:46	He pushed me into that weird room.
285	00:16:46	00:16:50	Tied me up, locked me in.
286	00:16:50	00:16:55	Then... I could hear him.
287	00:16:55	00:17:00	And I could hear her screaming, telling him to stop.
288	00:17:03	00:17:05	I never should've left Gwen alone.
289	00:17:05	00:17:08	It's not your fault, Emily.
290	00:17:08	00:17:14	So--so you were in the Preservation Room when Witten attacked your friend, is--is that right?
291	00:17:14	00:17:17	Yeah. That's right.
292	00:17:17	00:17:19	Okay.
293	00:17:19	00:17:21	Can you call the doctor?
294	00:17:21	00:17:23	I really feel awful.
295	00:17:23	00:17:25	Of course.
296	00:17:27	00:17:33	What was that about exactly? Emily just told you that Witten locked her in the Preservation Room.
297	00:17:33	00:17:34	Yeah, she did.
298	00:17:34	00:17:36	You don't believe her. No, I didn't say that.
299	00:17:36	00:17:39	But I do think it's a little curious that she could hear so much.
300	00:17:39	00:17:44	Locked in a vault, far away from the scene of the crime.
301	00:17:44	00:17:48	A--all I'm saying is if you want him this time, you're gonna need more than her statement.
302	00:17:48	00:17:49	Yeah, and I'm gonna get what I need.
303	00:17:49	00:17:51	Okay.
304	00:17:53	00:17:56	Hey, Sara, sometimes you push too hard, and you know it.
305	00:17:56	00:17:59	Just...don't.
306	00:18:04	00:18:10	So we got trace on that piece of glass that Doc pulled from our victim, Gwen Onetta.
307	00:18:10	00:18:12	Did the glass come from Witten's lamp?
308	00:18:12	00:18:16	No. Density and refractive index don't match.
309	00:18:16	00:18:22	Silica, sodium oxide, with a broadband anti-reflective coating.
310	00:18:22	00:18:25	Sounds like a flashlight lens. That's what I was thinking.
311	00:18:25	00:18:29	Now, I followed up on Emily Bridwell, our girl in the hospital.
312	00:18:29	00:18:38	Turns out, she was questioned in a string of burglaries in Summerlin, along with her roommates, our girl in the morgue, Gwen Onetta.
313	00:18:38	00:18:40	Flashlights, burglaries...
314	00:18:40	00:18:43	maybe these girls weren't invited to Witten's house.
315	00:18:43	00:18:45	Maybe they invited themselves.
316	00:18:45	00:18:47	Pair of Bling Ringers, Vegas-style?
317	00:18:47	00:18:52	Wait a minute, just because these girls were questioned in break-ins doesn't mean that Witten's not guilty.
318	00:18:52	00:19:00	The guy has a serious security system, so how would these so-called Bling Ringers get in in the first place, let alone one of them end up in a locked vault?
319	00:19:00	00:19:01	Those are all good questions.
320	00:19:01	00:19:04	Questions we know how to answer.
321	00:19:04	00:19:06	Yeah, we need to get our hands on that murder weapon.
322	00:19:06	00:19:08	Find the flashlight.
323	00:19:08	00:19:11	Haven't we turned that house upside-down at this point?
324	00:19:11	00:19:14	There is one room we haven't searched yet.
325	00:19:58	00:19:59	Hey, Sara...
326	00:19:59	00:20:01	I found the murder weapon.
327	00:20:01	00:20:03	Yeah, and it has Emily Bridwell's prints on it.
328	00:20:03	00:20:07	I know you've already talked to her, but I think you might want to have another conversation.
329	00:20:07	00:20:09	Yeah, well, that's gonna be a little difficult.
330	00:20:09	00:20:11	She died in the hospital two hours ago.
331	00:20:11	00:20:14	I got to call you back.
332	00:20:16	00:20:17	What the hell happened?
333	00:20:17	00:20:19	No Smurf jokes, please.
334	00:20:19	00:20:21	Can you explain this to me?
335	00:20:21	00:20:24	C.O.D. is paralysis of the respiratory system.
336	00:20:24	00:20:29	My educated guess is that it was caused by the ingestion of silver.
337	00:20:29	00:20:32	Blue skin is the result of a reaction called argyria.
338	00:20:32	00:20:46	Nanosilver's broken down in the stomach, absorbed into the bloodstream as a salt and then deposited in the skin, where exposure to light turns the salt back into elemental silver, creating the skin's bluish hue.
339	00:20:46	00:20:48	How would she have ingested silver?
340	00:20:48	00:20:49	I was just about to find out.
341	00:20:58	00:20:59	Whoa.
342	00:21:03	00:21:05	What is that?
343	00:21:05	00:21:07	It looks like film.
344	00:21:09	00:21:11	Okay, it's official. I've seen everything.
345	00:21:11	00:21:14	This girl died from swallowing a roll of film?
346	00:21:14	00:21:17	We know what's on it?
347	00:21:17	00:21:19	Hodges is working on it.
348	00:21:19	00:21:22	Patrol found Emily Bridwell's car a block away from Witten's house.
349	00:21:22	00:21:26	And a Post-it with his address and security codes.
350	00:21:26	00:21:28	Even the password to the Preservation Room.
351	00:21:28	00:21:32	So these girls, they were targeting Jack Witten's secret vault?
352	00:21:32	00:21:36	Yes. Then, for some reason, the partnership went south.
353	00:21:36	00:21:38	And I think I know why.
354	00:21:38	00:21:39	No honor among thieves.
355	00:21:39	00:21:41	Especially when you're banging the same guy.
356	00:21:43	00:21:45	I checked Gwen's cell phone records.
357	00:21:45	00:21:49	Turns out Emily's boyfriend texted her at a very inconvenient time.
358	00:21:52	00:21:54	What the...
359	00:21:54	00:21:56	You bitch! You're screwing Ryan?
360	00:21:56	00:21:58	Emily, chill out.
361	00:21:58	00:21:59	It's Ryan. Come on.
362	00:21:59	00:22:01	He said you weren't that into him.
363	00:22:01	00:22:02	Screw you!
364	00:22:05	00:22:07	Get off of me! (groans)
365	00:22:07	00:22:09	I'm out of here.
366	00:22:11	00:22:13	You're not going anywhere.
367	00:22:16	00:22:17	What is wrong with you?!
368	00:22:21	00:22:25	So Emily kills Gwen in a jealous rage.
369	00:22:25	00:22:27	At this point, you'd think, you'd run.
370	00:22:27	00:22:29	But she has to get what she came for.
371	00:22:33	00:22:35	She finds the film...
372	00:22:35	00:22:37	Yeah, I've got a dead girl in my living room.
373	00:22:37	00:22:39	...but she hears Jack Witten downstairs.
374	00:22:39	00:22:40	Just get somebody out here!
375	00:22:40	00:22:45	But she knows the house, and she knows his reputation, so she improvises.
376	00:22:45	00:22:51	Locks herself in the vault, hides the flashlight...
377	00:22:51	00:22:55	swallows the film...
378	00:22:55	00:22:57	and ties herself up.
379	00:22:57	00:23:01	And then she makes up her story.
380	00:23:01	00:23:03	But I guess that clears Witten, huh?
381	00:23:03	00:23:05	Yeah, at least for last night.
382	00:23:05	00:23:11	What I want to know is, what's so important on this piece of film that that girl would mule it out of there?
383	00:23:39	00:23:41	My God.
384	00:23:41	00:23:42	Is that who I think it is?
385	00:23:42	00:23:43	Was.
386	00:23:47	00:23:49	I forgot how young she looked.
387	00:23:51	00:23:54	Darcy Blaine.
388	00:23:54	00:23:55	Ghost from the past.
389	00:24:03	00:24:05	Well, she's definitely in Boulder City.
390	00:24:05	00:24:08	And I recognize these banners from the Millennium.
391	00:24:08	00:24:10	So it's got to be 2000.
392	00:24:10	00:24:15	So this film that was shot of Darcy, clearly before she died, has been in Witten's vault this whole time?
393	00:24:15	00:24:17	It would seem so.
394	00:24:17	00:24:19	You see the way she's looking in the camera?
395	00:24:19	00:24:24	She's flirting. And Witten claims that he never met Darcy before the night they walked out of the club together.
396	00:24:24	00:24:28	The look in her eyes says that there was a lot more to the relationship than that.
397	00:24:28	00:24:30	This film proves that everything he said about Darcy is a lie.
398	00:24:30	00:24:33	Not only did they know each other, they were probably having sex.
399	00:24:33	00:24:39	Well, Witten was released today. I say we go over to his house, shove those in his face and force a confession out of him.
400	00:24:39	00:24:41	Uh, wait a minute.
401	00:24:41	00:24:43	If we know he's guilty, somebody else does too.
402	00:24:43	00:24:45	Whoever sent our thieves in there to steal the film.
403	00:24:45	00:24:47	Well, it's got to be someone who knows Witten.
404	00:24:47	00:24:50	They knew the house, they knew the security codes, and they knew that he had the film.
405	00:24:50	00:24:53	But how would they know about it?
406	00:24:53	00:24:55	Maybe because they're the ones who shot it.
407	00:24:55	00:24:57	Did you test the film itself?
408	00:24:57	00:24:58	I did.
409	00:24:58	00:25:06	I found exactly 300 frames of nitrocellulose-based film print, manufactured sometime before 1952.
410	00:25:06	00:25:14	Well, that makes sense. When planning the premiere, Witten hired a bunch of photographers to use vintage cameras to shoot on vintage film.
411	00:25:14	00:25:21	Maybe one of the cameramen shot footage of Darcy for Witten's personal use too. Someone like that would know more intimate details about their relationship.
412	00:25:21	00:25:23	They might even know the truth of how Darcy died.
413	00:25:23	00:25:27	But why steal the film now, 14 years later?
414	00:25:27	00:25:29	I don't know, maybe the guy fell on hard times.
415	00:25:29	00:25:31	It's never too late to blackmail. All right.
416	00:25:31	00:25:33	Okay, let's say we're right.
417	00:25:33	00:25:35	How do we find the cameraperson that shot this?
418	00:25:35	00:25:39	Shot is the operative word here.
419	00:25:39	00:25:41	A strip of film is like a bullet.
420	00:25:41	00:25:51	Just like a gun creates unique rifling impressions on a round, the pressure plate in a camera imprints unique scratches on film.
421	00:25:51	00:25:55	These scratch patterns, they can help us find the camera that shot this film.
422	00:25:55	00:25:59	So find the camera... maybe find the cameraman.
423	00:25:59	00:26:01	And...
424	00:26:01	00:26:02	action.
425	00:26:02	00:26:04	No, no, no, no, no, no.
426	00:26:04	00:26:06	It's a sexy walk.
427	00:26:06	00:26:07	And look into camera. Give me a little smile.
428	00:26:07	00:26:09	What difference does it make?
429	00:26:09	00:26:11	We're testing the film stock, right?
430	00:26:11	00:26:13	Please don't tell me how to direct.
431	00:26:13	00:26:15	All right.
432	00:26:15	00:26:16	And...
433	00:26:16	00:26:18	action.
434	00:26:18	00:26:20	Okay, not bad.
435	00:26:20	00:26:22	Got that one. Go back to the one.
436	00:26:22	00:26:24	Little happier this time. Action.
437	00:26:24	00:26:26	Okay, that's better. In with a wink.
438	00:26:26	00:26:28	Stop, wink, and cut. Okay.
439	00:26:28	00:26:29	This feels weird.
440	00:26:29	00:26:31	You're a scared little lady.
441	00:26:31	00:26:32	Uh-huh. No, no, just... Okay.
442	00:26:32	00:26:34	Cut. Never mind.
443	00:26:35	00:26:37	Silent film.
444	00:26:37	00:26:38	And cut. Great.
445	00:26:38	00:26:40	You're Marilyn Monroe.
446	00:26:40	00:26:43	Just the slinkiest, sexiest lady you've ever been.
447	00:26:43	00:26:44	Looks great.
448	00:26:44	00:26:48	Okay, okay, no, that's... that's too sexy.
449	00:26:48	00:26:51	I located five vintage 35-millimeter cameras in the Vegas area.
450	00:26:51	00:26:55	Two from WLVU's film department and three from a seedy pawnshop.
451	00:26:57	00:26:59	Scratch pattern is identical.
452	00:26:59	00:27:00	Which camera was it?
453	00:27:00	00:27:02	This little baby here.
454	00:27:02	00:27:04	Arriflex 2C.
455	00:27:04	00:27:08	Sold to the pawnshop two months ago by a guy named Bob Geer.
456	00:27:08	00:27:10	He was a cameraman employed by Jack Witten.
457	00:27:10	00:27:14	And PD is pulling an address right now.
458	00:27:14	00:27:16	Robert Geer. (knocking on door)
459	00:27:20	00:27:22	Robert Geer. LVPD.
460	00:27:23	00:27:25	Mr. Geer?
461	00:27:27	00:27:29	Hello?
462	00:27:53	00:27:55	Been dead a while.
463	00:28:03	00:28:07	C.O.D. on our cameraman was a single gunshot to the head.
464	00:28:07	00:28:12	.22--same caliber as a gun registered to Jack Witten.
465	00:28:12	00:28:14	All right, but .22's a pretty common gun.
466	00:28:14	00:28:16	Doesn't necessarily point to Witten.
467	00:28:16	00:28:17	This does.
468	00:28:17	00:28:20	Geer's bank records going back to 2000.
469	00:28:20	00:28:29	Wow. $750,000 transferred into Geer's account from Iris Corp? What's that? That is an LLC that Witten formed to build his casino.
470	00:28:29	00:28:31	I think it's blackmail money.
471	00:28:31	00:28:36	Witten paid off Geer because Geer knew that he had killed Darcy, is that right?
472	00:28:36	00:28:39	Yes, and then 14 years later, he's run through the money.
473	00:28:39	00:28:40	He needs more.
474	00:28:40	00:28:43	But this time, his word against Witten isn't gonna be enough.
475	00:28:43	00:28:47	Right, this time he needs concrete proof of Witten's relationship with Darcy.
476	00:28:47	00:28:48	Hence the film.
477	00:28:48	00:28:54	And the Post-it that we found in Emily Bridwell's car with Witten's address and security codes on it?
478	00:28:54	00:28:56	It's in Bob Geer's handwriting.
479	00:28:56	00:28:59	He hired our thieves.
480	00:28:59	00:29:06	So it looks like Geer, after all this time, decided to put the pinch on Witten again. Okay.
481	00:29:06	00:29:08	So the guy worked for me.
482	00:29:08	00:29:13	Everybody knows that. But Geer knew about you and Darcy. He came back for more money, so you killed him.
483	00:29:13	00:29:16	(chuckles) Here we go again.
484	00:29:16	00:29:17	But this time it's gonna stick.
485	00:29:17	00:29:22	We pulled a .22-caliber bullet out of Geer's head-- same caliber as your gun.
486	00:29:22	00:29:23	We're running it now. I didn't do it.
487	00:29:23	00:29:25	Wha...
488	00:29:25	00:29:28	I haven't seen Geer in... forever.
489	00:29:28	00:29:30	I barely knew the guy.
490	00:29:30	00:29:32	Just like I barely knew Darcy.
491	00:29:32	00:29:34	When are you guys gonna give up?
492	00:29:34	00:29:37	For someone you barely knew, you sure had a serious obsession.
493	00:29:45	00:29:47	Your buddy Geer shot that for you, didn't he?
494	00:29:47	00:29:49	You been keeping it all these years.
495	00:29:53	00:29:55	I've never seen that before.
496	00:29:55	00:29:59	Oh, come on, Jack, you're getting high with a wild party girl and 500-a-night...
497	00:29:59	00:30:01	No, no. No, no. Darcy wasn't like that.
498	00:30:01	00:30:03	She had a problem, just like me.
499	00:30:03	00:30:05	What problem was that, Jack?
500	00:30:05	00:30:06	I met her at N.A.
501	00:30:09	00:30:12	She was a mixed-up girl.
502	00:30:12	00:30:14	She liked old movies.
503	00:30:14	00:30:16	We used to...
504	00:30:16	00:30:18	watch them in my screening room together.
505	00:30:18	00:30:20	She got a kick out of the old actresses, you know?
506	00:30:20	00:30:24	Bergman, Vivien Leigh, Gene Tierney in Laura.
507	00:30:26	00:30:28	Darcy was a bright girl.
508	00:30:28	00:30:30	She had better things ahead of her.
509	00:30:30	00:30:34	Yeah, I get it. No, it wasn't like that.
510	00:30:34	00:30:35	She was like a daughter to me.
511	00:30:39	00:30:40	But I was a broken man. I...
512	00:30:42	00:30:44	...couldn't control myself.
513	00:30:47	00:30:48	With drugs...
514	00:30:48	00:30:51	with women. With Darcy.
515	00:30:54	00:30:55	Yeah, with Darcy.
516	00:30:58	00:31:01	And for years, I tried telling myself it never happened.
517	00:31:01	00:31:05	We were together at the club.
518	00:31:05	00:31:09	Next thing I knew, Darcy was lying there, dead.
519	00:31:09	00:31:12	And I forgot Bob Geer was coming over to the house that morning.
520	00:31:12	00:31:13	I have no idea what happened.
521	00:31:13	00:31:15	Stay cool, Jack.
522	00:31:15	00:31:16	Let me handle this, okay?
523	00:31:16	00:31:18	He said he could help me.
524	00:31:18	00:31:20	Help you get rid of the body?
525	00:31:20	00:31:21	Yeah.
526	00:31:24	00:31:26	But the one thing he didn't tell me was...
527	00:31:26	00:31:29	how much it was gonna cost me.
528	00:31:29	00:31:32	All this time, you guys have been trying to prove I'm a killer.
529	00:31:32	00:31:35	I got your proof.
530	00:31:40	00:31:44	When I was cleaning up, Geer took this picture of Darcy.
531	00:31:48	00:31:51	Sometimes I forget what I did.
532	00:31:51	00:31:54	So I kept this.
533	00:31:54	00:31:58	So I never forget the kind of person I really am.
534	00:32:00	00:32:03	I just heard-- Witten confessed.
535	00:32:03	00:32:05	Yeah.
536	00:32:05	00:32:07	Uh, thought you'd be happier.
537	00:32:07	00:32:10	Ballistics just came back on the bullet that killed Geer.
538	00:32:10	00:32:12	It wasn't a match to Witten's gun.
539	00:32:12	00:32:14	Okay, so maybe Witten had someone else do it for him.
540	00:32:14	00:32:15	We still have him for Darcy.
541	00:32:15	00:32:17	Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, either, anymore.
542	00:32:17	00:32:21	Witten said that he'd never seen that old film of Darcy before; he was telling the truth.
543	00:32:21	00:32:23	What do you mean?
544	00:32:23	00:32:27	This film collection in Witten's vault was a recent acquisition.
545	00:32:28	00:32:31	The film canisters belonged to Bob Geer?
546	00:32:31	00:32:32	Up until a month ago.
547	00:32:32	00:32:37	At which time, he pawned his vintage camera and all his film, including the can that had 300 frames of Darcy Blaine.
548	00:32:37	00:32:39	I spoke to the pawnshop owner.
549	00:32:39	00:32:45	He said that a regular-- one of his collectors-- bought all the film--that collector was Jack Witten.
550	00:32:45	00:32:56	We've been thinking that Bob Geer wanted to get ahold of that film of Darcy so that he could prove that Witten was lying about their relationship-- but why go after that film if he had something even better?
551	00:32:56	00:32:59	Yeah, not just proof of their relationship, but...
552	00:32:59	00:33:01	proof of murder.
553	00:33:01	00:33:02	This doesn't make any sense.
554	00:33:02	00:33:09	What am I looking at? The tox panel on Darcy Blaine's blood that we found in the car trunk definitely had high levels of cocaine, but...
555	00:33:09	00:33:11	we're saying that she was roofied, right?
556	00:33:11	00:33:13	Right.
557	00:33:13	00:33:17	Well, it's weird because the GHB was never fully metabolized into her blood.
558	00:33:17	00:33:21	Meaning what? It just doesn't make sense.
559	00:33:21	00:33:24	Greg, you are a great tech.
560	00:33:24	00:33:26	And I know that you want to be in the field.
561	00:33:26	00:33:28	In this job, sometimes you got to go beyond numbers.
562	00:33:28	00:33:31	Beyond what's on the face of things.
563	00:33:36	00:33:37	What are you thinking about?
564	00:33:39	00:33:42	Something Catherine once told me about looking deeper.
565	00:33:44	00:33:47	The Tin Man's rivet.
566	00:33:47	00:33:52	Uh, for the most recent reissue of The Wizard of Oz, they used a new restoration technique.
567	00:33:52	00:33:56	Details that had been lost had suddenly now become vivid.
568	00:33:56	00:34:02	One of those being that the Tin Man had a rivet between his eyes that nobody had seen in 50 years.
569	00:34:02	00:34:05	Maybe there's some detail in this film that we're not seeing.
570	00:34:05	00:34:07	There's only one way to find out.
571	00:34:07	00:34:11	I'll send this to FotoKem, have them do a wet print and rescan it.
572	00:34:22	00:34:24	January 2001.
573	00:34:24	00:34:29	The bank was torn down in '05, but I remembered it had a news ticker.
574	00:34:30	00:34:35	That film was shot two months after Darcy Blaine was supposedly murdered.
575	00:34:35	00:34:37	She faked her death.
576	00:34:39	00:34:43	And she's smiling at the camera because she got away with it.
577	00:35:00	00:35:01	Darcy.
578	00:35:01	00:35:02	I've been looking for you.
579	00:35:02	00:35:05	Sorry, my name's Vivian.
580	00:35:05	00:35:07	Oh, right, uh, Vivian Sinclair.
581	00:35:07	00:35:09	We found that in Bob Geer's cell phone.
582	00:35:09	00:35:15	Vivian as in Vivien Leigh, your favorite movie star and Sinclair, as in your mother's maiden name.
583	00:35:15	00:35:20	Hotel Blanc said that Vivian Sinclair was checking out tonight, heading home to Chicago.
584	00:35:20	00:35:23	Sorry to delay your flight.
585	00:35:23	00:35:25	You're making a big mistake.
586	00:35:25	00:35:27	You're the one who made a big mistake.
587	00:35:27	00:35:33	Bob Geer's phone records shows a Vivian Sinclair called him 20 minutes before he was murdered.
588	00:35:33	00:35:36	Cell tower hit puts you a block away from his apartment, it puts you there.
589	00:35:36	00:35:38	We found a gun in your suitcase, a .22.
590	00:35:38	00:35:41	Ballistics confirms that it's the murder weapon.
591	00:35:41	00:35:44	He... It was self-defense. He attacked me.
592	00:35:44	00:35:47	All right.
593	00:35:47	00:35:50	14 years ago...
594	00:35:50	00:35:54	we put ourselves on the line for an innocent girl we thought had been murdered.
595	00:35:56	00:35:59	You manipulated the evidence, you put an innocent man through hell.
596	00:35:59	00:36:03	That night, you and Jack Witten were at the club, you did go home together.
597	00:36:03	00:36:07	But it wasn't you who blacked out, it was Witten, like most nights.
598	00:36:07	00:36:10	Once he was out, you called your friend, Bob Geer.
599	00:36:10	00:36:12	Bob? He's out.
600	00:36:12	00:36:14	Let's do this.
601	00:36:17	00:36:20	Witten woke up in a drug haze, panicked.
602	00:36:20	00:36:25	Just like you planned, Bob Geer showed up in the morning, told Witten he'd take care of things.
603	00:36:28	00:36:30	And then, you two took care of things.
604	00:36:35	00:36:37	You drew your own blood.
605	00:36:37	00:36:40	You made it look like you'd been roofied.
606	00:36:40	00:36:42	And then you planted it in your car trunk.
607	00:36:46	00:36:48	You framed Jack Witten.
608	00:36:48	00:36:49	The man that was trying to help you.
609	00:36:49	00:36:52	You think Witten was trying to help me?
610	00:36:52	00:36:55	You don't know Jack Witten.
611	00:36:55	00:36:58	He was like every other man in my life-- just trying to use me.
612	00:36:58	00:37:00	Is that the story that you're going with?
613	00:37:00	00:37:02	I got one. Bob Geer.
614	00:37:02	00:37:04	Seems like he wasn't using you.
615	00:37:04	00:37:05	Seems to me he was trying to help you.
616	00:37:05	00:37:16	Phone records show that he reached out to you six weeks ago when he realized that his film collection had fallen into the hands of Jack Witten, including 300 frames that prove...
617	00:37:16	00:37:19	that this was a lie.
618	00:37:19	00:37:20	Dead girl.
619	00:37:21	00:37:23	Dead girl walking.
620	00:37:28	00:37:30	I did a terrible thing.
621	00:37:30	00:37:32	I was a mixed-up junkie.
622	00:37:32	00:37:35	I was desperate and afraid.
623	00:37:35	00:37:36	Yeah.
624	00:37:36	00:37:39	Oh, yeah, yeah.
625	00:37:39	00:37:41	Geer and I framed Jack Witten.
626	00:37:43	00:37:46	But it was just a way for me to escape.
627	00:37:46	00:37:48	Escape from what?
628	00:37:48	00:37:54	From my father, who, I'm sure, was devastated at my loss.
629	00:37:54	00:37:56	You know why?
630	00:37:56	00:38:01	Because with me gone, he couldn't come into my bed every night when my mother was asleep.
631	00:38:02	00:38:05	I did what I had to do to protect myself.
632	00:38:05	00:38:07	Tell that to Bob Geer.
633	00:38:08	00:38:11	I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
634	00:38:11	00:38:12	I'm a mom!
635	00:38:12	00:38:14	I have two girls.
636	00:38:14	00:38:15	I have a husband and a life that I cherish.
637	00:38:15	00:38:19	I am not... I'm not this person anymore.
638	00:38:19	00:38:21	People can change.
639	00:38:25	00:38:28	Terrible...
640	00:38:28	00:38:32	unspeakable things happen to all of us, but...
641	00:38:32	00:38:35	that doesn't give anyone the right to destroy someone's life.
642	00:38:35	00:38:45	Whatever happened to you, whatever the truth is, for 14 years, you let an innocent man believe that he killed the one thing that he cared about.
643	00:38:45	00:38:50	The one person in his screwed-up universe that he genuinely loved like a daughter.
644	00:38:50	00:38:54	You took his desire to protect and save you, and you perverted it.
645	00:38:54	00:38:57	You twisted it.
646	00:38:57	00:38:59	I know you.
647	00:38:59	00:39:01	I know who you are.
648	00:39:01	00:39:04	You haven't changed, Darcy.
649	00:39:04	00:39:06	You never will.
650	00:39:13	00:39:14	Thank you.
651	00:39:16	00:39:18	Walter Blaine has hired counsel for Darcy.
652	00:39:18	00:39:22	He's wrapped his fatherly arms around his daughter.
653	00:39:24	00:39:26	Do you believe her?
654	00:39:26	00:39:27	Her story about him molesting her?
655	00:39:27	00:39:30	She's definitely screwed up.
656	00:39:30	00:39:33	Maybe it's from abuse.
657	00:39:33	00:39:36	Maybe...she's just a bad seed.
658	00:39:36	00:39:39	I don't know what to believe anymore.
659	00:39:39	00:39:40	Oh, I know that feeling.
660	00:39:45	00:39:47	That thing I said to you about pushing too hard...
661	00:39:50	00:39:52	Thank God you did.
662	00:39:58	00:40:01	You're a free man, Jack.
663	00:40:05	00:40:07	What's going to happen to her?
664	00:40:10	00:40:12	I wouldn't think you'd care.
665	00:40:12	00:40:16	All these years, and I thought I'd killed her.
666	00:40:16	00:40:18	Had to live with that.
667	00:40:18	00:40:22	Now, I just keep thinking I could've done more to save her.
668	00:40:22	00:40:24	Hey, it wasn't your fault.
669	00:40:24	00:40:25	She made her own choices.
670	00:40:25	00:40:27	Yeah.
671	00:40:29	00:40:32	Look, Jack, uh...
672	00:40:32	00:40:33	I'm sorry.
673	00:40:33	00:40:36	No apologies.
674	00:40:36	00:40:38	You guys did your job.
675	00:40:40	00:40:42	Thanks for giving me my life back.
676	00:41:02	00:41:06	Well, it's lights out for The Premiere.
677	00:41:06	00:41:07	Witten can still build it.
678	00:41:07	00:41:09	Ah, it wouldn't work.
679	00:41:09	00:41:11	Too innocent for Vegas these days.
680	00:41:17	00:41:19	Speaking of another time...
681	00:41:20	00:41:21	Please put that away.
682	00:41:28	00:41:31	All this evidence, all these years.
683	00:41:33	00:41:35	You ever think you've had enough?
684	00:41:35	00:41:37	Are you kidding?
685	00:41:37	00:41:39	I'm just getting started.
