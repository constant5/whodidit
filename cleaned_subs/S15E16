0,00:00:09,00:00:16,"WOMAN: I don't know what it is, but the vibe in this place always gets me feeling hot."
1,00:00:16,00:00:19,Sexy.
2,00:00:25,00:00:28,Don't tell me you don't feel it.
3,00:00:28,00:00:30,Do you want to take a ride?
4,00:00:32,00:00:33,(giggles)
5,00:00:33,00:00:34,Come on.
6,00:00:34,00:00:37,I know you want to.
7,00:00:38,00:00:40,That's why we're here.
8,00:00:40,00:00:42,Right?
9,00:00:47,00:00:48,The hiker called it in.
10,00:00:48,00:00:50,Saw something glittering near the trailhead.
11,00:00:50,00:00:50,Glittering?
12,00:00:50,00:00:53,"Yeah, first he thought it was trash, maybe tinfoil."
13,00:00:53,00:00:55,"Well, turns out it wasn't tinfoil at all."
14,00:00:58,00:00:59,More like a tin-woman.
15,00:00:59,00:01:00,(cell phone rings)
16,00:01:00,00:01:02,She never found that yellow brick road.
17,00:01:02,00:01:03,No.
18,00:01:03,00:01:04,This is Crawford.
19,00:01:05,00:01:07,"Hey, Nick."
20,00:01:07,00:01:09,"Talk about your Silver Surfer, huh?"
21,00:01:09,00:01:11,You get any I.D. on her yet? No purse.
22,00:01:11,00:01:13,The only thing on her besides this dress...
23,00:01:15,00:01:17,...is blunt-force trauma.
24,00:01:17,00:01:19,Do we have any idea on the time of death?
25,00:01:19,00:01:21,"Jimmy, you got that, yeah?"
26,00:01:21,00:01:23,"Yeah, liver temp puts it between 12:00 a.m."
27,00:01:23,00:01:24,and 3:00 a.m.
28,00:01:24,00:01:27,"Midnight and 3:00-- okay, thanks, Jimbo."
29,00:01:27,00:01:28,That's one hell of a sight.
30,00:01:28,00:01:29,Yeah.
31,00:01:29,00:01:31,That's straight out of Goldfinger.
32,00:01:31,00:01:32,What do you make of it?
33,00:01:32,00:01:40,"I hate to speculate before we've collected any evidence, but this is Vegas, she could just be eye candy for some rich guy's party, for all we know."
34,00:01:40,00:01:42,"Eye candy, really?"
35,00:01:42,00:01:45,You can rent pretty girls like this and paint them up for parties nowadays.
36,00:01:45,00:01:49,"CRAWFORD: If she was someone's eye candy fantasy, she's not anymore."
37,00:01:49,00:01:52,"They chewed her up, and they spit her out."
38,00:01:52,00:01:54,Only in the Silver State.
39,00:02:30,00:02:38,(camera shutter clicking)
40,00:03:36,00:03:40,Looks like our Silver Girl was more than just silver on the outside.
41,00:03:40,00:03:42,I found silver paint in both lungs.
42,00:03:42,00:03:45,"So, blunt-force trauma was not cause of death."
43,00:03:45,00:03:46,"No, she asphyxiated."
44,00:03:48,00:03:49,In silver paint.
45,00:03:51,00:03:53,Not something you see every day.
46,00:03:53,00:03:55,"No, but this is, at least in this town."
47,00:03:55,00:03:57,Our girl here liked to party.
48,00:03:57,00:04:02,Nasal perforations and irritations in the lung passages suggest chronic drug use.
49,00:04:02,00:04:07,"And besides the blunt-force trauma, I found other evidence of a struggle before she succumbed to the silver."
50,00:04:08,00:04:11,There's a linear contusion pattern over the trapezius here.
51,00:04:11,00:04:13,Looks like parallel lines.
52,00:04:13,00:04:16,"Yeah, kind of like a barbecue grill."
53,00:04:16,00:04:18,"Whatever it was, it impacted her strongly."
54,00:04:18,00:04:23,There's also a strange bruising pattern right here between the lines.
55,00:04:23,00:04:26,Dug out some glass particles from her elbow.
56,00:04:26,00:04:27,Might tell us what we're looking at.
57,00:04:28,00:04:30,"Thanks, Doc."
58,00:04:30,00:04:31,Hey. Hey.
59,00:04:31,00:04:34,Got an I.D. on our Silver Girl.
60,00:04:34,00:04:36,Her prints were in the system.
61,00:04:36,00:04:39,"Ava Montrose, a local with a long sheet."
62,00:04:39,00:04:41,Numerous burglary and drug arrests.
63,00:04:41,00:04:42,Next of kin?
64,00:04:42,00:04:46,Her last known address was her mother's place in Summerlin.
65,00:04:46,00:04:47,Her mom is on her way here now.
66,00:04:47,00:04:50,Sara's going to do the notification.
67,00:04:50,00:04:53,"SIDLE: Mrs. Montrose, when was the last time you saw your daughter?"
68,00:04:53,00:04:57,I haven't seen Ava for months.
69,00:04:57,00:05:00,I was always afraid something like this was going to happen.
70,00:05:00,00:05:03,"Crowds she ran with, places she'd go."
71,00:05:03,00:05:05,What places would that be?
72,00:05:05,00:05:07,Places where you-you buy drugs.
73,00:05:09,00:05:13,"Dangerous-looking drug dealer once showed up at our door, looking for her."
74,00:05:13,00:05:15,Did you catch the drug dealer's name?
75,00:05:15,00:05:16,No.
76,00:05:16,00:05:20,And Ava wouldn't say.
77,00:05:20,00:05:22,We never had the best relationship.
78,00:05:22,00:05:23,Why's that?
79,00:05:23,00:05:25,(father sighs)
80,00:05:25,00:05:28,She resented me.
81,00:05:28,00:05:30,For taking the place of her father.
82,00:05:30,00:05:32,After Ruth and he split up.
83,00:05:32,00:05:33,"It's not your fault, Duncan."
84,00:05:33,00:05:37,"Truth is, Ava didn't listen to anybody but Ava."
85,00:05:39,00:05:41,"Do you have children, Miss Sidle?"
86,00:05:41,00:05:43,I don't.
87,00:05:43,00:05:45,It's not right for a mother to bury her daughter.
88,00:05:48,00:05:51,It's not right.
89,00:05:51,00:05:52,(crying): It's not right.
90,00:05:55,00:05:57,We are gonna find out who did this.
91,00:05:57,00:06:00,Is there anyone that you can think of that I should talk to?
92,00:06:00,00:06:01,A friend or boyfriend?
93,00:06:01,00:06:03,Ava had lots of boyfriends.
94,00:06:03,00:06:05,Nothing serious.
95,00:06:05,00:06:14,"I-I wish I could help more, but Ava, her life, her friends, she was always a mystery to me."
96,00:06:19,00:06:20,Redecorating your mother's house?
97,00:06:20,00:06:22,"I am, actually."
98,00:06:22,00:06:25,But that's not why I'm studying these shades of gray.
99,00:06:25,00:06:28,The silver covering our victim's body was indeed paint.
100,00:06:28,00:06:29,But not just any paint.
101,00:06:29,00:06:31,Chromic potassium sulfate.
102,00:06:31,00:06:33,Chrome? Exactly.
103,00:06:33,00:06:37,It's a new environmentally friendly chrome that's being used in the auto-painting industry.
104,00:06:37,00:06:43,"This color is called ""silver zephyr."" What about the glass shards in her elbow?"
105,00:06:43,00:06:44,They follow a similar road.
106,00:06:44,00:06:46,The glass is from a car headlamp.
107,00:06:46,00:06:48,It's made of bisphenal polycarbonate.
108,00:06:48,00:06:52,And it's suggestive of a non-sealed beam headlamp.
109,00:06:52,00:06:56,"Now, those were discontinued by government mandate in 1939."
110,00:06:56,00:07:00,I'm thinking that Ava Montrose was in an altercation in close proximity to a car.
111,00:07:00,00:07:07,"Now, Doc thought that these grill marks might be from a barbecue, but perhaps they're from a car."
112,00:07:07,00:07:11,"And not just any car; a classic car, pre-1939."
113,00:07:11,00:07:13,Doesn't exactly narrow it down.
114,00:07:13,00:07:15,"Unless, of course, you know what you're looking for."
115,00:07:52,00:07:54,That is a beautiful car.
116,00:07:54,00:07:57,1938 Packard Touring Sedan.
117,00:07:57,00:07:59,Pushrod straight-6.
118,00:07:59,00:08:00,130 horsepower.
119,00:08:00,00:08:02,And a symbol of a dying era.
120,00:08:02,00:08:04,"You know, they went out of business a couple years later."
121,00:08:04,00:08:05,"So, what?"
122,00:08:05,00:08:08,You thinking that Ava Montrose had a run-in with this car?
123,00:08:08,00:08:10,"Yeah, well, bruising on her back says so."
124,00:08:10,00:08:18,"And I believe that the trauma to her neck was caused by the famous Packard ""Goddess of Speed"" hood ornament."
125,00:08:18,00:08:19,"All right, I buy that."
126,00:08:19,00:08:22,Can't be that many 1938 Packards in Vegas.
127,00:08:22,00:08:24,I found two in the DMV.
128,00:08:24,00:08:29,First one is owned by a collector who kept it in his garage which burned down six months ago.
129,00:08:29,00:08:30,Scratch Packard number one.
130,00:08:30,00:08:35,"Number two is alive and well, and owned by an investment banker named Carlo Derosa."
131,00:08:35,00:08:37,What do we know about him?
132,00:08:37,00:08:42,"He won't return my calls, so he is either a very busy man, or he may be hiding something."
133,00:08:51,00:08:54,(roaring engine approaches)
134,00:08:56,00:08:59,SIDLE: How much you want to bet this is Derosa?
135,00:09:00,00:09:02,Maybe.
136,00:09:02,00:09:07,"All right, you know, I say that we just pay the fines, and then we can tell the regulators to shove it."
137,00:09:07,00:09:09,"Excuse me, uh, Carlo Derosa?"
138,00:09:09,00:09:11,Hi. I'm Julie Finlay. This is Sara Sidle.
139,00:09:11,00:09:12,We're with the crime lab. We need to speak with you.
140,00:09:12,00:09:15,"No, no, no, I'm busy. Just call my office."
141,00:09:15,00:09:17,I got this.
142,00:09:19,00:09:20,(alarm whooping)
143,00:09:22,00:09:25,"Oh, oh, I-I'm sorry, did that just happen?"
144,00:09:25,00:09:27,I can't hear you.
145,00:09:28,00:09:28,(alarm stops)
146,00:09:28,00:09:30,"Oh, that's better."
147,00:09:30,00:09:31,What the hell is happening here?
148,00:09:31,00:09:33,Do you own a 1938 Packard?
149,00:09:33,00:09:35,"Yes, I do. What's it to you?"
150,00:09:35,00:09:38,"SIDLE: A woman was killed last night, and the evidence traces to your car."
151,00:09:38,00:09:39,What woman?
152,00:09:39,00:09:41,What-what are you talking about?
153,00:09:41,00:09:42,Ava Montrose.
154,00:09:42,00:09:43,Do you know her?
155,00:09:43,00:09:46,"Oh, my God, uh..."
156,00:09:46,00:09:48,That's my ex-girlfriend.
157,00:09:48,00:09:50,"Your ex? Yeah, yeah."
158,00:09:50,00:09:51,"No, we broke up about a year ago."
159,00:09:51,00:09:52,I haven't seen her since.
160,00:09:53,00:09:55,Hang on. What happened here?
161,00:09:55,00:09:56,Where do you keep your Packard?
162,00:09:56,00:09:57,In the vault.
163,00:09:57,00:09:58,"""The vault""?"
164,00:09:58,00:10:00,"Yeah, that's what I said, the vault."
165,00:10:00,00:10:04,It's in a warehouse downtown.
166,00:10:09,00:10:15,"My dad was a classic car collector, and, uh, he built this place to keep his babies safe."
167,00:10:15,00:10:17,Somebody forget to pay the power bill?
168,00:10:17,00:10:18,Nope.
169,00:10:18,00:10:20,"No, my dad liked to show his cars off."
170,00:10:20,00:10:23,His favorite part was the unveiling.
171,00:10:33,00:10:35,Welcome to car heaven.
172,00:10:35,00:10:36,Wow.
173,00:10:36,00:10:38,They don't make 'em like these anymore.
174,00:10:38,00:10:40,Is that a '57 Chevy?
175,00:10:40,00:10:40,You got it.
176,00:10:40,00:10:44,"Uh, V-8 engine and twin barrel... blah, blah, blah, blah."
177,00:10:44,00:10:46,All I know is that it's old and it's slow.
178,00:10:46,00:10:49,That's one way to look at it.
179,00:10:49,00:10:50,Where's the Packard?
180,00:10:50,00:10:52,"Oh! Um... yeah, it's getting a touch-up."
181,00:10:52,00:10:54,It's in the mechanic's bay.
182,00:10:54,00:10:56,What the hell's going on?
183,00:10:56,00:10:58,"What do you think you're doing, Carlo?"
184,00:10:58,00:10:59,"I told you, no buyers!"
185,00:10:59,00:11:01,"No, you need to back up, dude, okay? Who are you?"
186,00:11:01,00:11:03,The owner of these cars.
187,00:11:04,00:11:06,"This is my charming brother, Aron."
188,00:11:06,00:11:07,And you are not the owner.
189,00:11:07,00:11:09,Neither are you. They're not for sale.
190,00:11:09,00:11:10,We're not buyers.
191,00:11:10,00:11:12,CARLO: They're cops. SIDLE: We're CSIs.
192,00:11:12,00:11:15,We're investigating a murder-- a woman named Ava Montrose.
193,00:11:17,00:11:18,Ava?
194,00:11:18,00:11:19,"My ex, Aron."
195,00:11:19,00:11:20,You remember her.
196,00:11:20,00:11:23,It's hard to keep track of your bimbo parade.
197,00:11:23,00:11:25,I-I don't understand. What does this have to do with the vault?
198,00:11:37,00:11:38,"Hey, Sara."
199,00:11:38,00:11:40,Can you come here a sec?
200,00:11:40,00:11:42,"Hey. You keep an eye on them, please?"
201,00:11:47,00:11:49,Is this our '38 Packard?
202,00:11:49,00:11:50,"Yes, it is."
203,00:11:50,00:11:53,And there definitely was a struggle.
204,00:11:53,00:11:56,That ended with a fatal chrome bath.
205,00:11:59,00:11:59,"FINLAY: Oh, check it out."
206,00:11:59,00:12:01,Couple of drops of chrome.
207,00:12:01,00:12:03,Kind of looks like they're heading out the door.
208,00:12:03,00:12:05,"Yeah, maybe carrying our Silver Woman."
209,00:12:13,00:12:16,"FINLAY: Yep, the trail ends right over here."
210,00:12:16,00:12:21,The only empty parking spot in the whole place.
211,00:12:21,00:12:23,"Hey, guys, can you join us?"
212,00:12:23,00:12:26,I assume there's usually a car parked here.
213,00:12:26,00:12:28,"Oh, my God, where's the car?"
214,00:12:28,00:12:29,What car?
215,00:12:29,00:12:30,The '76 Cadillac.
216,00:12:30,00:12:32,The most valuable car in the collection.
217,00:12:32,00:12:33,"CARLO: God, I can't believe this."
218,00:12:33,00:12:36,Caddy's gone. Ava's dead.
219,00:12:37,00:12:38,What the hell happened here?
220,00:12:38,00:12:39,"SIDLE: Yeah, that's what we'd like to know."
221,00:12:39,00:12:43,"Along with, what is it about your stolen car that was worth dying over?"
222,00:12:47,00:12:49,I-I can't believe this is happening.
223,00:12:49,00:12:51,"I mean, who would do this?"
224,00:12:51,00:12:58,"Aron, we found no signs of any break-in, so besides you and your brother, who else had access to the place?"
225,00:12:58,00:12:59,"Uh, just Rubio, our mechanic."
226,00:12:59,00:13:02,"Uh, he's the only other person who would know the security code. And how well do you know him?"
227,00:13:02,00:13:05,"If you're asking if I trust him, absolutely."
228,00:13:05,00:13:07,He's been with the family for 20 years.
229,00:13:07,00:13:08,He's not even in the country right now.
230,00:13:08,00:13:10,He left for Italy two days ago.
231,00:13:10,00:13:11,What about you?
232,00:13:11,00:13:13,Where were you last night?
233,00:13:13,00:13:15,"I was at my studio, painting."
234,00:13:15,00:13:17,"Landscapes, not women."
235,00:13:17,00:13:18,And Carlo?
236,00:13:18,00:13:19,Where was he last night?
237,00:13:20,00:13:23,"Uh, I was in my office until about midnight."
238,00:13:23,00:13:24,SIDLE: Anyone with you?
239,00:13:24,00:13:26,"No, I sent my assistant home around about 10:00."
240,00:13:26,00:13:29,How long were you dating Ava Montrose?
241,00:13:29,00:13:30,About a year.
242,00:13:30,00:13:35,"I tried cutting it off six months into it, but, uh, she had a hard time letting go."
243,00:13:35,00:13:38,"If you weren't with her last night, then what was she doing here?"
244,00:13:38,00:13:40,That is a damn good question.
245,00:13:40,00:13:42,Is there any chance that Ava knew the security code?
246,00:13:42,00:13:43,We used to come down here a lot.
247,00:13:43,00:13:47,"She could've, I guess, easily looked over my shoulder while I was punching it in."
248,00:13:47,00:13:48,"I mean, she did love this place."
249,00:13:48,00:13:51,She especially loved my dad's old Caddy.
250,00:13:51,00:13:53,Enough to try and steal it?
251,00:13:53,00:13:54,Look...
252,00:13:54,00:13:56,Ava was a messed-up kid.
253,00:13:56,00:13:59,We both partied way too hard back in the day.
254,00:13:59,00:14:01,"I mean, I cleaned up my act..."
255,00:14:01,00:14:04,but Ava did not.
256,00:14:04,00:14:06,What can you tell me about this car?
257,00:14:06,00:14:07,'76 Caddy.
258,00:14:07,00:14:09,"Sounds nice, but..."
259,00:14:09,00:14:10,"what, exactly, makes it so valuable?"
260,00:14:11,00:14:13,My father was murdered in it.
261,00:14:13,00:14:15,And that makes it more valuable?
262,00:14:15,00:14:23,"There's a certain crowd of collectors who pay serious money for so-called ""death cars."" James Dean's Porsche, Jayne Mansfield's Buick Electra..."
263,00:14:23,00:14:27,"I'm sorry, I don't recognize the name ""Derosa."" Your father was famous?"
264,00:14:27,00:14:28,"You're not from around here, are you?"
265,00:14:28,00:14:29,"No, I'm from Seattle."
266,00:14:29,00:14:31,My dad was Alfonz Derosa.
267,00:14:31,00:14:33,Kind of a Vegas legend.
268,00:14:33,00:14:38,"Okay, so you're saying that he was murdered in the Cadillac?"
269,00:14:38,00:14:40,He was gunned down by a hit man.
270,00:14:40,00:14:42,"October 3, 1989."
271,00:14:42,00:14:45,"Killer worked for Pete Bamonte, a Chicago loan shark."
272,00:14:45,00:14:48,"I've heard that story, actually."
273,00:14:48,00:14:49,How much is the Cadillac worth?
274,00:14:49,00:14:50,It'd be close to a million.
275,00:14:50,00:14:52,And the rest of the collection?
276,00:14:52,00:14:55,"All up, we'd be talking about five."
277,00:14:55,00:14:59,"I gather, from your argument, that you're ready to sell, but your brother, Aron, isn't."
278,00:14:59,00:15:02,"Yeah, we've been battling over what to do with the collection since, um..."
279,00:15:02,00:15:04,our mom died.
280,00:15:04,00:15:04,When was that?
281,00:15:04,00:15:06,Two months ago.
282,00:15:06,00:15:09,"According to the will, we both own equal shares in the cars."
283,00:15:09,00:15:11,I offered to split the... the collection in half.
284,00:15:11,00:15:12,"You know, I'd sell mine, he could keep his."
285,00:15:12,00:15:16,"Actually, you know, Aron's the one who could use the money, but..."
286,00:15:16,00:15:18,Van Gogh won't compromise.
287,00:15:18,00:15:18,Van Gogh?
288,00:15:18,00:15:20,Kid's a starving artist.
289,00:15:20,00:15:22,(laughs)
290,00:15:22,00:15:22,The worst kind.
291,00:15:22,00:15:24,Talentless.
292,00:15:24,00:15:26,"Anyway, he needs to grow up."
293,00:15:37,00:15:39,Talk about an icon of Vegas history.
294,00:15:39,00:15:40,Hmm.
295,00:15:40,00:15:43,Didn't you write a book about Vegas mobsters?
296,00:15:43,00:15:45,Alfonz Derosa had his own chapter.
297,00:15:45,00:15:46,What was his story?
298,00:15:46,00:15:48,"Savvy businessman, ruthless killer."
299,00:15:48,00:15:51,He ran the skim at the Tangier's counting room.
300,00:15:51,00:15:55,"Guy was known as ""The Vise."" I guess he didn't get his nickname for his woodworking."
301,00:15:55,00:15:58,It's how he broke his enemies' knees.
302,00:15:58,00:16:00,"Mmm, they really don't make 'em like they used to. Nope."
303,00:16:00,00:16:02,So tell me about Derosa's murder.
304,00:16:02,00:16:09,"Well, in 1989, The Vise was in a turf war with, uh, Pete Bamonte, some hothead from Chicago."
305,00:16:09,00:16:16,"One night, The Vise took his mistress for a drive up to a lovers' lane near Mount Charleston."
306,00:16:16,00:16:17,That was his last ride.
307,00:16:19,00:16:20,(both chuckling)
308,00:16:20,00:16:21,SANDERS: They parked.
309,00:16:21,00:16:23,Romance was in the air.
310,00:16:23,00:16:26,Then the mood was broken...
311,00:16:26,00:16:30,and Alfonz Derosa and his mistress were dead.
312,00:16:30,00:16:34,Some hit man with ties to Bamonte was eventually convicted for the murder.
313,00:16:34,00:16:36,Some jailhouse snitch dimed him out.
314,00:16:36,00:16:38,He eventually died in prison.
315,00:16:38,00:16:39,And what happened to the sons?
316,00:16:39,00:16:40,They must've been pretty young.
317,00:16:40,00:16:41,Their mother raised them.
318,00:16:41,00:16:45,"And as far as anybody can tell, they didn't follow in their dad's footsteps."
319,00:16:45,00:16:50,"So now one's an investment banker and one's an artist, and they hate each other."
320,00:16:50,00:16:52,And they both have access to this place.
321,00:16:52,00:16:54,I don't believe a word either one of them says.
322,00:16:54,00:16:58,So maybe our witness on wheels can help us.
323,00:17:08,00:17:12,Looks like we've got blood on the hood ornament.
324,00:17:12,00:17:15,That would confirm your theory that Ava had a run-in with the car.
325,00:17:16,00:17:21,(grunting)
326,00:17:25,00:17:26,FINLAY: Got something else.
327,00:17:26,00:17:27,She broke a heel.
328,00:17:31,00:17:35,I think there's some residue on it.
329,00:17:40,00:17:42,SANDERS: Got a partial shoe impression.
330,00:17:42,00:17:45,Could be a man's loafer. SANDERS: Could be.
331,00:17:45,00:17:48,So Ava breaks her heel trying to get away.
332,00:17:48,00:17:51,Killer grabs her near the chrome vat.
333,00:17:51,00:17:55,(screams)
334,00:17:57,00:17:59,FINLAY: Gives her a silver dye job to die for.
335,00:17:59,00:18:03,SANDERS: Puts the body in the Caddy...
336,00:18:04,00:18:11,...and drives away.
337,00:18:13,00:18:20,"I know you don't trust the brothers, but if one of them did it, why not clean up?"
338,00:18:20,00:18:21,You have a point.
339,00:18:25,00:18:27,You got something?
340,00:18:27,00:18:28,Yeah.
341,00:18:35,00:18:38,It's a promotional magnet.
342,00:18:38,00:18:41,"""Cienzo's Pizzeria."" Specks of chrome on it."
343,00:18:41,00:18:43,Says to me this was here last night.
344,00:18:43,00:18:44,Maybe the killer dropped it.
345,00:18:44,00:18:47,Gives us something to sink our teeth into.
346,00:18:51,00:18:53,Ah! Pizza party.
347,00:18:53,00:18:55,Thanks for the invite.
348,00:18:55,00:18:57,"All right, I've only got a little while here."
349,00:18:57,00:18:57,What do you got?
350,00:18:57,00:18:59,Mmm. Mmm. Yeah.
351,00:18:59,00:19:02,I ran touch DNA on the security keypad at the vault.
352,00:19:02,00:19:05,"Besides the brothers, I found a match to Ava Montrose."
353,00:19:05,00:19:07,Confirms she knew the password.
354,00:19:07,00:19:11,And suggesting maybe she graduated from stealing watches to stealing cars.
355,00:19:11,00:19:14,"Is that all you got there, Papa John?"
356,00:19:14,00:19:15,Far from it.
357,00:19:15,00:19:18,This is a slice of Cienzo's pizza.
358,00:19:18,00:19:20,"Uh, the pizza parlor with the promotional magnet."
359,00:19:20,00:19:20,We were just there.
360,00:19:20,00:19:21,HODGES: Thin crust.
361,00:19:21,00:19:22,Very New Yorky. Delish.
362,00:19:23,00:19:25,I don't suppose one of their employees is our killer?
363,00:19:25,00:19:27,"None of them has a record, if that's what you're asking."
364,00:19:27,00:19:29,And none of them collects cars.
365,00:19:29,00:19:34,"However, I did run the credit cards for the past week and came across a very interesting customer."
366,00:19:34,00:19:35,Henry.
367,00:19:36,00:19:37,What?
368,00:19:37,00:19:38,"The magnets, please."
369,00:19:38,00:19:40,"Right, right."
370,00:19:40,00:19:42,I'm sorry.
371,00:19:42,00:19:45,We picked up these exemplar magnets at the pizzeria.
372,00:19:45,00:19:50,I think I can use them to explain what the magnet that Greg found was doing at the classic car vault.
373,00:19:50,00:19:52,Allow me to demonstrate.
374,00:19:54,00:19:56,You're showing me how a magnet works.
375,00:19:57,00:19:59,Are you looking to get fired today?
376,00:19:59,00:20:01,Wait for it.
377,00:20:03,00:20:04,Voilà.
378,00:20:04,00:20:07,"The magnet sticks to one side of the fender, but not the other. Why?"
379,00:20:07,00:20:10,Because this part of the fender has been repaired.
380,00:20:10,00:20:13,It's made with Bondo automotive filler.
381,00:20:13,00:20:14,So the magnet didn't stick.
382,00:20:14,00:20:17,It's a little trick that car appraisers use.
383,00:20:17,00:20:18,ANDREWS: And...
384,00:20:18,00:20:24,"according to credit card records, there is a certain Vegas car appraiser who eats at Cienzo's once a week."
385,00:20:28,00:20:30,"Thanks for coming in, Mr. Bixler."
386,00:20:30,00:20:33,I have a couple of questions about your car appraisal business.
387,00:20:33,00:20:35,Whatever you need.
388,00:20:35,00:20:37,Are you familiar with the Alfonz Derosa collection?
389,00:20:37,00:20:38,Intimately.
390,00:20:38,00:20:43,"I was, uh, recently hired by the estate to appraise their cars, just after Mrs. Derosa passed away."
391,00:20:43,00:20:44,When was that?
392,00:20:44,00:20:46,"Uh, about two months ago. Hmm."
393,00:20:46,00:20:49,So you haven't been back to the vault since?
394,00:20:49,00:20:51,No.
395,00:20:51,00:20:53,I see.
396,00:20:53,00:20:58,I understand that you're also a regular at Cienzo's Pizzeria on Flamingo.
397,00:20:58,00:21:00,Guilty as charged.
398,00:21:00,00:21:02,"Uh, is that a crime?"
399,00:21:02,00:21:03,"I mean, I know that it's not good for me..."
400,00:21:03,00:21:06,Have you ever used one of their magnets to appraise a car?
401,00:21:06,00:21:07,"Uh, yes."
402,00:21:07,00:21:09,"Uh, yeah, they're quite handy."
403,00:21:09,00:21:11,Explains why we found one in the vault.
404,00:21:11,00:21:15,"Um, yeah, um, like I said, I was there two months ago."
405,00:21:15,00:21:16,Mm-hmm.
406,00:21:16,00:21:18,"Well, the pizzeria has a great special right now."
407,00:21:18,00:21:21,"Large, two toppings for $7.99."
408,00:21:21,00:21:24,But it just started this week.
409,00:21:24,00:21:27,And we found this magnet in Derosa's vault yesterday.
410,00:21:27,00:21:30,It's the same place where a woman named Ava Montrose was murdered.
411,00:21:30,00:21:34,I do not like being lied to.
412,00:21:34,00:21:35,Were you there last night?
413,00:21:35,00:21:36,No.
414,00:21:36,00:21:37,"I swear, no. I..."
415,00:21:37,00:21:39,"Come on, Mr. Bixler."
416,00:21:39,00:21:41,"Uh, but I was there three days ago."
417,00:21:41,00:21:44,"So first it was two months ago, and now it's three days ago."
418,00:21:44,00:21:46,"Look, I realize I lied to you. I'm sorry."
419,00:21:46,00:21:48,"Um, I have a very good reason."
420,00:21:48,00:21:50,What's that?
421,00:21:50,00:21:56,"Carlo Derosa, uh, he hired me to do an updated appraisal of a '76 Cadillac."
422,00:21:56,00:21:58,A very generous one.
423,00:21:58,00:21:59,He can be most persuasive.
424,00:21:59,00:22:01,Why did he want a new appraisal?
425,00:22:01,00:22:04,He wouldn't tell me. I can only assume that he had a buyer lined up.
426,00:22:04,00:22:05,Did his brother Aron know about it?
427,00:22:05,00:22:07,No.
428,00:22:07,00:22:10,"No, if he found out, I'm sure he would have blocked the sale."
429,00:22:10,00:22:13,"Look, I'm a little scared telling you all this."
430,00:22:13,00:22:14,Um...
431,00:22:16,00:22:20,"Uh, you know who Carlo Derosa's father was?"
432,00:22:20,00:22:22,"Yeah, I know."
433,00:22:22,00:22:25,"RUSSELL: You know, this whole thing is starting to look more and more like an inside job."
434,00:22:25,00:22:27,One that went sideways.
435,00:22:27,00:22:29,Carlo Derosa wants to sell his father's Caddy.
436,00:22:29,00:22:31,His brother gets wind of the sale and stops him.
437,00:22:31,00:22:35,"Right, so Carlo calls his morally-challenged ex-girlfriend."
438,00:22:35,00:22:39,"But he doesn't want to get his hands dirty, and he needs an alibi."
439,00:22:39,00:22:41,So maybe Ava enlists one of her sketchy friends to help.
440,00:22:41,00:22:43,Someone with experience in auto theft.
441,00:22:43,00:22:45,"Friend sees the car, gets greedy..."
442,00:22:45,00:22:49,"Kills her, takes the car, dumps her body."
443,00:22:49,00:22:50,Hey.
444,00:22:50,00:22:51,We need to talk shoes.
445,00:22:52,00:22:54,Not yours.
446,00:22:54,00:22:57,Just got the result on the trace we found on Ava's broken heel.
447,00:22:57,00:23:01,Elements of concrete and titanium oxide.
448,00:23:01,00:23:01,"Now, I've seen this before."
449,00:23:01,00:23:04,It's a unique road-paving material they use to eliminate pollution.
450,00:23:04,00:23:07,It's found on a half-mile strip of Verdugo Street.
451,00:23:07,00:23:09,"That's an industrial neighborhood, right?"
452,00:23:09,00:23:10,Exactly.
453,00:23:10,00:23:16,And I did some searching-- it's the exact neighborhood it'a the exact neighborhood where Ava Montrose just rented a 20-by-20 storage unit.
454,00:23:16,00:23:18,That's the perfect size to hide a car.
455,00:23:29,00:23:32,STOKES: Busted lock-- someone got here before us.
456,00:23:45,00:23:47,CRAWFORD: LVPD.
457,00:23:47,00:23:49,Anybody in here?
458,00:23:49,00:23:50,Here's our Caddy.
459,00:23:51,00:23:53,Yeah.
460,00:23:53,00:23:55,(clattering)
461,00:23:56,00:23:58,LVPD. Come on out.
462,00:24:00,00:24:01,Listen to me.
463,00:24:01,00:24:06,"If you don't want to die today, show yourself slowly."
464,00:24:11,00:24:13,Let me see some hands.
465,00:24:16,00:24:19,You're making a mistake.
466,00:24:19,00:24:21,"No, you're the one who's made the mistake."
467,00:24:25,00:24:30,"Aron, you mind telling me what you were doing in a murdered woman's storage space with a stolen car?"
468,00:24:30,00:24:31,It's not what it looks like. No?
469,00:24:31,00:24:33,"Well, I'll tell you what it looks like to me."
470,00:24:33,00:24:41,"You recruited Ava Montrose, your brother's ex, the one you barely remembered, to help you steal your Daddy's Caddy before your brother could sell it."
471,00:24:41,00:24:43,"So, what happened?"
472,00:24:43,00:24:47,"Uh, Ava-- the whacked-out drug addict-- did she try to play you somehow?"
473,00:24:47,00:24:47,You get angry.
474,00:24:47,00:24:49,Things get ugly.
475,00:24:49,00:24:50,You got it wrong.
476,00:24:50,00:24:53,About Ava and about me.
477,00:24:53,00:24:54,I do?
478,00:24:54,00:24:55,"Oh, uh, okay."
479,00:24:55,00:24:57,"Well, e-enlighten me."
480,00:24:57,00:24:59,"I'm not a thief, and I'm not a murderer."
481,00:24:59,00:25:01,And Ava?
482,00:25:01,00:25:03,"She was an addict, but she wasn't a whack-job."
483,00:25:03,00:25:05,She was a beautiful soul.
484,00:25:05,00:25:07,It sounds like you're the one that had a thing for her.
485,00:25:07,00:25:09,She loved me.
486,00:25:09,00:25:11,She left Carlo for me. Right.
487,00:25:11,00:25:13,"No, that kind of thing happens all the time."
488,00:25:13,00:25:17,"Uh, girl dumps a high-rolling, Mercedes-driving investment banker for a..."
489,00:25:17,00:25:21,"I'm sorry, where do you work?"
490,00:25:21,00:25:22,I manage a copy store.
491,00:25:22,00:25:26,"And there's nothing wrong with that, but maybe you see my point."
492,00:25:26,00:25:27,Believe what you want.
493,00:25:27,00:25:29,I don't give a rat's ass.
494,00:25:29,00:25:32,All I know is Carlo is the one who got to her.
495,00:25:32,00:25:34,He knew exactly how to do it.
496,00:25:34,00:25:39,With drugs? Carlo's the one who put Ava up to stealing the Caddy. I know it.
497,00:25:39,00:25:41,He's the one who wanted to sell it. I wouldn't...
498,00:25:41,00:25:46,"It's a great story, Aron, but it still doesn't explain why you're the one we found in that storage locker!"
499,00:25:46,00:25:49,I was trying to get my car back.
500,00:25:49,00:25:50,I set up a credit card in Ava's name.
501,00:25:50,00:25:55,"Bills came to me, I saw she rented a storage unit, I put two and two together-- that's why I was there."
502,00:25:55,00:25:57,That car means everything to me.
503,00:25:59,00:26:01,It's the way I remember my father.
504,00:26:01,00:26:04,"Right, because that's where he died."
505,00:26:04,00:26:05,No.
506,00:26:05,00:26:07,"No, because that's where he really lived."
507,00:26:08,00:26:11,I used to stay up late drawing.
508,00:26:11,00:26:13,And Carlo would be asleep.
509,00:26:13,00:26:20,"My dad would come in and grab me, and... and we'd go for a ride."
510,00:26:20,00:26:21,Just the two of us.
511,00:26:21,00:26:24,"Will you buy me a car like this when I'm grown-up, Daddy?"
512,00:26:24,00:26:26,"I'll get you 20 of them, Aron."
513,00:26:26,00:26:27,"Sky's the limit, kid."
514,00:26:30,00:26:34,"Aron, were you with your father the night he was murdered?"
515,00:26:34,00:26:36,It was our last ride together.
516,00:26:36,00:26:38,"He, uh, dropped me off at a diner."
517,00:26:39,00:26:43,Said he'd be back in an hour.
518,00:26:43,00:26:48,"I mean, I know my dad wasn't a saint, but he was good to me."
519,00:26:48,00:26:49,What about Carlo?
520,00:26:49,00:26:52,They fought.
521,00:26:52,00:26:54,They were too much alike.
522,00:26:54,00:26:56,That's how I know he stole it.
523,00:26:56,00:27:00,He's stealing from the house-- he learned that from my dad.
524,00:27:10,00:27:16,"""Do you want to drive the car where 'The Vise' was murdered?"" Yeah, not so much."
525,00:27:16,00:27:18,"Well, someone wanted to drive that car."
526,00:27:18,00:27:20,Where'd you find this?
527,00:27:20,00:27:25,Carlo Derosa posted it a week ago on Farringer's car auction Web site.
528,00:27:25,00:27:31,"According to Carlo's bank records, an anonymous buyer put down $100,000 on the car."
529,00:27:31,00:27:34,But we know that brother Aron stopped the sale.
530,00:27:34,00:27:37,"Yes, but there's no indication that Carlo returned the deposit."
531,00:27:37,00:27:40,Suggesting that he hadn't given up on the idea of selling it.
532,00:27:40,00:27:47,"So, where are we? We got one brother who's willing to steal the car to sell it, the other one willing to steal it to protect it."
533,00:27:47,00:27:49,So which brother did it?
534,00:27:49,00:27:50,I don't think it was either one of them.
535,00:27:50,00:27:52,You remember the shoe impression we found at the scene?
536,00:27:52,00:27:53,Yeah.
537,00:27:53,00:27:57,"We compared it to all the shoes the brothers owned, and we did not get a match."
538,00:27:57,00:27:59,Doesn't mean that the shoes weren't thrown away.
539,00:27:59,00:28:00,That's true.
540,00:28:00,00:28:02,But it's also true that we could be looking for somebody else.
541,00:28:02,00:28:04,"A scorned buyer, perhaps."
542,00:28:04,00:28:09,"Okay, so a buyer's interested in the Mob car, maybe uses Mob tactics to get it."
543,00:28:09,00:28:12,Any luck on following the money trail?
544,00:28:12,00:28:14,"No, it all leads to offshore accounts."
545,00:28:14,00:28:15,And no names.
546,00:28:15,00:28:18,But I will keep working on it.
547,00:28:18,00:28:21,How come you know so much about classic cars?
548,00:28:21,00:28:23,Cute guy in shop class.
549,00:28:23,00:28:24,"No, seriously."
550,00:28:24,00:28:28,"Actually, uh, my brother owned a '57 Chevy rust bucket."
551,00:28:28,00:28:30,Left it in the garage when he went to college.
552,00:28:30,00:28:31,Totally forgot about it.
553,00:28:31,00:28:35,"And then, when I got a little older, I needed a way to get to school, so..."
554,00:28:35,00:28:36,You fixed it up.
555,00:28:36,00:28:40,Took the engine completely apart and reassembled it piece by piece.
556,00:28:40,00:28:44,I found it really interesting to see how it all connected.
557,00:28:44,00:28:47,Carburetor as crime scene.
558,00:28:47,00:28:50,"Yeah, it's all in the details."
559,00:28:59,00:29:01,I can't believe this backseat.
560,00:29:01,00:29:03,You could have a picnic in there.
561,00:29:03,00:29:06,I think Alfonz and his mistress were up to more than that.
562,00:29:06,00:29:08,Talk about a last ride.
563,00:29:08,00:29:09,(chuckles)
564,00:29:12,00:29:15,BRODY: I think I may have found something from our killer's last ride.
565,00:29:15,00:29:17,Some sort of fiber.
566,00:29:30,00:29:33,"I think I found a chrome flake, too."
567,00:29:33,00:29:34,Could be from our Silver Woman.
568,00:29:34,00:29:37,We know this car was used for the body dump.
569,00:29:37,00:29:39,Maybe she was transported in the trunk.
570,00:29:39,00:29:40,You look in there yet?
571,00:29:40,00:29:43,Nope.
572,00:29:43,00:29:44,Let's check it out.
573,00:29:51,00:29:52,Oh.
574,00:29:52,00:29:55,A tarp with chrome paint and blood.
575,00:29:55,00:29:56,Confirms that theory.
576,00:29:56,00:29:57,Yep.
577,00:30:00,00:30:02,"Ooh, what's that?"
578,00:30:03,00:30:07,A copy of Ken Bixler's appraisal of this car.
579,00:30:07,00:30:10,Looks like it was printed from the Farringer Web site.
580,00:30:10,00:30:13,"Well, maybe this printout will give us a print."
581,00:30:19,00:30:20,I got a partial.
582,00:30:21,00:30:23,"Not sure if it'll be enough for AFIS, though."
583,00:30:23,00:30:28,"Well, then, let's hope that our mystery buyer left some epithelials behind."
584,00:30:33,00:30:35,Find anything?
585,00:30:35,00:30:37,"Hey, Morgan, what do you got?"
586,00:30:37,00:30:40,I just got results on the touch DNA from the appraisal report.
587,00:30:40,00:30:42,So who's the buyer of the Cadillac?
588,00:30:42,00:30:46,Results come back as a female familial match to Ava Montrose.
589,00:30:46,00:30:48,And she doesn't have any sisters or daughters.
590,00:30:48,00:30:50,That just leaves her mother.
591,00:30:50,00:30:52,Ruth Montrose.
592,00:30:52,00:30:54,Ruth Montrose is our buyer.
593,00:30:54,00:30:58,"And if our theory is correct, she's not just our buyer; she's our killer."
594,00:31:03,00:31:05,You must help me get this car.
595,00:31:05,00:31:07,"Don't ""must"" me, Mother."
596,00:31:07,00:31:10,"This fiasco's all yours, not mine."
597,00:31:10,00:31:15,"Darling, I have borrowed a lot of money from some very disreputable men."
598,00:31:15,00:31:17,"If I don't pay them, Lord knows what's going to happen to me."
599,00:31:17,00:31:19,Do you understand?
600,00:31:19,00:31:21,I understand perfectly.
601,00:31:21,00:31:23,You need me.
602,00:31:23,00:31:26,I have never asked you for anything.
603,00:31:26,00:31:30,SIDLE: So you admit to using your own daughter to help steal a car.
604,00:31:30,00:31:32,Ava knew how to get into the vault.
605,00:31:32,00:31:35,"It's appalling, I know."
606,00:31:35,00:31:38,I can't argue with that.
607,00:31:38,00:31:40,Why did you need to buy the car so badly?
608,00:31:40,00:31:41,I wasn't the buyer.
609,00:31:41,00:31:44,I was just an intermediary for a wealthy gentleman from Dubai.
610,00:31:44,00:31:47,I met him at a party a month ago.
611,00:31:47,00:31:49,He loves Mob lore and cars.
612,00:31:49,00:31:52,I told him that Alfonz Derosa's death car was for sale.
613,00:31:52,00:31:53,And he was interested?
614,00:31:53,00:31:55,He was ready to pay two million when he came back from Dubai.
615,00:31:55,00:31:57,"Double the appraisal, double the purchase price."
616,00:31:57,00:31:59,That's not a bad profit.
617,00:31:59,00:32:03,"So, you borrowed the money from a loan shark to make the deposit."
618,00:32:03,00:32:04,Yes.
619,00:32:04,00:32:08,"And then that sentimental fool, Aron Derosa, canceled the sale."
620,00:32:08,00:32:10,And that's when your problems really started.
621,00:32:12,00:32:14,What happened to Ava in that vault?
622,00:32:14,00:32:15,(chuckles)
623,00:32:15,00:32:18,I have no idea.
624,00:32:18,00:32:20,"Yeah, see, I thought we were getting somewhere."
625,00:32:20,00:32:22,I wasn't there.
626,00:32:22,00:32:24,I would never murder my own daughter.
627,00:32:24,00:32:25,"I wish I could believe that, Ms. Montrose."
628,00:32:25,00:32:27,I've seen a lot over the years.
629,00:32:27,00:32:29,Nothing surprises me.
630,00:32:29,00:32:33,Believe what you will.
631,00:32:33,00:32:35,I think Ava brought an unsavory friend to help her.
632,00:32:36,00:32:39,And then something went terribly wrong.
633,00:32:40,00:32:43,"RUSSELL: Well, she's not gonna win mother of the year awards."
634,00:32:43,00:32:45,But would she kill her own daughter?
635,00:32:45,00:32:46,You believe her story?
636,00:32:46,00:32:49,"Well, I think there's a pragmatic woman under all that crazy, (phone chirps)"
637,00:32:49,00:32:51,and her daughter's more valuable alive than dead.
638,00:32:51,00:32:57,Mmm. Greg wants to know if I feel like taking a ride back to the past.
639,00:32:58,00:33:02,"Boy, this looks like it could all be part of a new edition for your book."
640,00:33:02,00:33:03,Could be.
641,00:33:03,00:33:06,But I also think it relates to Ava Montrose's murder.
642,00:33:06,00:33:08,This is Pete Bamonte.
643,00:33:08,00:33:11,Chicago loan shark and the guy behind Alfonz Derosa's murder.
644,00:33:11,00:33:13,"Right, he hired the hit man to do it."
645,00:33:13,00:33:18,"When I was researching the Derosa murder from '89, I discovered that Bamonte had a son."
646,00:33:18,00:33:19,Bamonte got divorced.
647,00:33:19,00:33:23,"His wife remarried, and then his son took his stepfather's last name, which was Reidel."
648,00:33:23,00:33:26,"Reidel, as in Duncan Reidel?"
649,00:33:26,00:33:31,Ruth Montrose's boyfriend is Pete Bamonte's son?
650,00:33:31,00:33:38,"I'm saying maybe we have a new suspect, and maybe Ruth Montrose's story about a buyer in Dubai was just a story."
651,00:33:38,00:33:41,And the real buyer is a little closer to home.
652,00:33:41,00:33:42,"Okay, so where's our proof?"
653,00:33:42,00:33:45,"How are we doing with the, uh, trace that we got from the Caddy?"
654,00:33:45,00:33:46,Finn's working on it.
655,00:33:51,00:33:52,Where you headed?
656,00:33:53,00:33:55,I'm not sure.
657,00:33:55,00:34:02,"So, if you're right and Duncan Reidel is the killer, then he must have done restoration work before he killed Ava."
658,00:34:02,00:34:03,What do you mean?
659,00:34:03,00:34:06,"Well, I got the results back from the fiber that we found on the passenger seat."
660,00:34:06,00:34:08,Cannabis sativa.
661,00:34:08,00:34:09,Hemp.
662,00:34:09,00:34:10,It's used for upholstery stuffing.
663,00:34:10,00:34:15,And the thing I know about classic cars is they did not use hemp in the carpet or in the seat lining.
664,00:34:15,00:34:17,"Not in 1976, anyway."
665,00:34:17,00:34:20,"Also, check out the result on the chrome."
666,00:34:20,00:34:23,It's not chromic potassium sulfate.
667,00:34:23,00:34:24,It didn't come off the girl.
668,00:34:24,00:34:26,It must have flaked off the car.
669,00:34:26,00:34:28,But on what part of the car?
670,00:34:28,00:34:32,"Yeah, that is what I am trying to figure out."
671,00:34:32,00:34:39,"Well, we found both pieces of trace here, near the passenger seat."
672,00:34:44,00:34:46,The chrome on the headrest post is flaking.
673,00:34:46,00:34:48,Someone messed with it.
674,00:34:48,00:34:53,"Maybe the killer swapped out the original headrest with a new one, reupholstered with hemp."
675,00:34:53,00:34:55,There's one way to know for sure.
676,00:34:55,00:35:01,"After Alfonz and his mistress were shot, this entire seat was covered in blood."
677,00:35:09,00:35:14,When is the last time someone was shot in the head in a car and didn't leave any blood on the headrest?
678,00:35:14,00:35:16,How about never?
679,00:35:16,00:35:19,"So, Ava's killer replaced the headrest."
680,00:35:19,00:35:21,The question is: Why?
681,00:35:21,00:35:27,SANDERS: The hit man who went to prison for the murder of Alfonz Derosa wasn't convicted on evidence.
682,00:35:27,00:35:30,He was convicted on the word of a jailhouse snitch.
683,00:35:30,00:35:31,So you're thinking he was set up?
684,00:35:31,00:35:35,"Yeah, maybe there was a different shooter, someone closer to the guy who ordered the hit."
685,00:35:35,00:35:39,"In 1989, Duncan Reidel was 18 years old."
686,00:35:39,00:35:42,"So, Duncan could've been the one to pull the trigger for his father."
687,00:35:42,00:35:46,And maybe there was something in that headrest that could've proven it.
688,00:35:46,00:35:47,Like a bullet.
689,00:35:47,00:35:53,Exactly. So let's see if there's something on this headrest that will help us make our case today.
690,00:36:27,00:36:27,SANDERS: Hey.
691,00:36:27,00:36:30,"Did you get an I.D. off the headrest? Yeah, I did."
692,00:36:30,00:36:31,Not who we expected.
693,00:36:31,00:36:33,Reidel's off the hook.
694,00:36:33,00:36:34,So who is it?
695,00:36:34,00:36:38,"RUSSELL: You know, it's interesting, what a car means to different people."
696,00:36:38,00:36:40,You take this Cadillac.
697,00:36:40,00:36:44,"To Carlo Derosa, it means revenge."
698,00:36:44,00:36:49,Selling it's a great way to get back at a father who cared more about his cars than about him.
699,00:36:49,00:36:52,"Yeah, to Aron Derosa, keeping it is a way of remembering that father."
700,00:36:52,00:36:53,"To him, the car means love."
701,00:36:53,00:36:56,"Right, we-we were just wondering..."
702,00:36:56,00:36:57,What did it mean to you?
703,00:37:00,00:37:02,Mr. Bixler?
704,00:37:02,00:37:05,Um... (chuckles) nothing.
705,00:37:05,00:37:07,"I mean, I mean, not a damn thing."
706,00:37:07,00:37:09,It was just a part of my job.
707,00:37:09,00:37:10,"Wrong answer, Ken."
708,00:37:10,00:37:17,"Yeah, we-we kind of figured that, to you, the car means heartbreak."
709,00:37:17,00:37:18,Heartbreak?
710,00:37:18,00:37:20,I... What are you talking about?
711,00:37:20,00:37:25,"You see, Ken, we found your DNA on the passenger side headrest."
712,00:37:25,00:37:28,"Well, uh, I inspected that headrest, so..."
713,00:37:28,00:37:31,"No, actually, the headrest you inspected was the old headrest."
714,00:37:31,00:37:33,The manufactured one.
715,00:37:33,00:37:35,We're talking about the new headrest.
716,00:37:35,00:37:36,And that's because you replaced it.
717,00:37:36,00:37:41,"We, uh, recovered the old headrest in the Dumpster behind your appraisal office, and your prints were on that."
718,00:37:41,00:37:48,We also found an expended bullet that was a direct match to a Beretta manufactured in 1980.
719,00:37:48,00:37:50,Your Beretta.
720,00:37:50,00:37:54,It's the same gun you fired last year when you thought an intruder was breaking into your house.
721,00:37:54,00:37:56,"RUSSELL: Remember, the cops were called?"
722,00:37:56,00:37:59,The bullet and the gun were processed and then put in the system.
723,00:37:59,00:38:03,And it's also the same gun that was used to murder Alfonz Derosa.
724,00:38:03,00:38:07,"Yeah, unfortunately, though... The recovered bullets were too degraded to process."
725,00:38:07,00:38:14,"Right, but in the cops' defense, they didn't realize that you fired three shots, not two."
726,00:38:14,00:38:17,A stray round going into the headrest.
727,00:38:17,00:38:20,(laughter)
728,00:38:29,00:38:31,The cops thought it was a professional hit.
729,00:38:31,00:38:36,They didn't realize it was just an enraged car salesman with a shaky hand.
730,00:38:36,00:38:40,What I don't understand is: Why'd you feel like you had to kill him in the first place?
731,00:38:40,00:38:41,You barely knew the guy.
732,00:38:42,00:38:45,I wasn't there to kill Alfonz.
733,00:38:45,00:38:48,I was there to kill Vera.
734,00:38:48,00:38:49,Vera Scanell.
735,00:38:49,00:38:50,Alfonz's mistress.
736,00:38:50,00:38:51,My fiancée.
737,00:38:52,00:38:54,What a beautiful wreck she was.
738,00:38:54,00:38:57,She never cared how much pain she caused me.
739,00:38:57,00:39:00,The humiliation.
740,00:39:00,00:39:02,They both got what was coming to them.
741,00:39:02,00:39:03,I didn't regret it for a second.
742,00:39:03,00:39:09,Until 30 years later when you realized that you left some evidence behind.
743,00:39:09,00:39:11,"Ken, what about Ava?"
744,00:39:11,00:39:13,How'd she play into this?
745,00:39:13,00:39:15,I've known her for years.
746,00:39:15,00:39:17,I was friends with her dealer.
747,00:39:17,00:39:19,I used to help him launder money.
748,00:39:19,00:39:25,"She came to me about a week ago, telling me about her mom's plan to steal the car."
749,00:39:25,00:39:27,They wanted help getting it out of the country.
750,00:39:27,00:39:34,"But with the car being sold, you were worried that the bullet in the headrest would be discovered and finally matched to your Beretta."
751,00:39:34,00:39:37,I had to get it out.
752,00:39:37,00:39:39,I sent her away.
753,00:39:39,00:39:44,I sent her away for an hour or so so I could get my work done.
754,00:39:45,00:39:46,Too bad she had to come back.
755,00:39:49,00:39:52,The vibe in this place always gets me feeling hot.
756,00:39:52,00:39:53,Sexy.
757,00:39:53,00:39:55,Do you want to take a ride?
758,00:39:55,00:39:56,The hell you doing here?
759,00:39:56,00:39:58,I got bored. Let's go.
760,00:39:58,00:39:59,Now.
761,00:39:59,00:40:01,The car's not ready yet.
762,00:40:01,00:40:04,I thought you said you were working on the engine.
763,00:40:05,00:40:08,"What are you up to, Kenny boy?"
764,00:40:08,00:40:10,"You got an angle, don't you?"
765,00:40:10,00:40:13,"What is it? I want in. Stay out of it, Ava."
766,00:40:13,00:40:14,(laughs)
767,00:40:14,00:40:16,Now I know it's good.
768,00:40:16,00:40:19,"You want me to stay out of it, it's gonna cost..."
769,00:40:23,00:40:25,I told you to stay the hell out of here!
770,00:40:25,00:40:25,Come here! Get back!
771,00:40:25,00:40:28,Come back! (grunts)
772,00:40:28,00:40:32,(grunting and groaning)
773,00:40:32,00:40:33,Come here. Come on!
774,00:41:00,00:41:02,Just talked to Carlo Derosa.
775,00:41:02,00:41:05,He's sending someone over to pick up the Caddy.
776,00:41:05,00:41:09,"Well, Bixler did confess, so the car's not evidence anymore."
777,00:41:09,00:41:10,What about Aron Derosa?
778,00:41:10,00:41:12,Still doesn't want to sell?
779,00:41:12,00:41:14,"Actually, the brothers finally compromised."
780,00:41:14,00:41:16,They're donating the car to the Mob Museum.
781,00:41:16,00:41:19,"Oh, that sounds like a good place for her."
782,00:41:19,00:41:24,Still such a shame that she's never gonna see the road again.
783,00:41:26,00:41:28,One last ride?
784,00:41:28,00:41:30,I thought you'd never ask.
