1,00:00:24,00:00:26,"The last time I was out here, this was all desert."
2,00:00:26,00:00:32,"CABBIE: One day, I'm looking at cactus; the next day a mini mall."
3,00:00:32,00:00:34,What brings you all the way out here?
4,00:00:34,00:00:35,Work.
5,00:00:36,00:00:37,Stop!
6,00:00:37,00:00:37,(tires squealing)
7,00:00:44,00:00:46,"Miss, you okay?"
8,00:00:47,00:00:48,Stay here.
9,00:01:04,00:01:05,Hey!
10,00:01:08,00:01:11,(shouting)
11,00:01:11,00:01:13,Where do you think you're going?
12,00:01:13,00:01:14,Get out of there!
13,00:01:22,00:01:24,(shouting encouragement)
14,00:01:26,00:01:28,(screaming)
15,00:01:42,00:01:44,(siren wailing)
16,00:01:48,00:01:48,Where's your posse?
17,00:01:48,00:01:49,I have no idea.
18,00:01:49,00:01:51,I was actually on a date.
19,00:01:51,00:01:52,Hmm?
20,00:01:55,00:01:58,"My God, what am I looking at?"
21,00:01:58,00:02:00,Taxi hit a kid crossing the boulevard.
22,00:02:00,00:02:04,"The crowd over there saw the driver Rajeeb Khandelwahl, trying to get away."
23,00:02:04,00:02:08,"So, they pull him out of the front seat of the cab and they beat him up."
24,00:02:08,00:02:10,"I mean, they... they beat him up bad."
25,00:02:10,00:02:12,He's on his way to Desert Palm.
26,00:02:12,00:02:15,His insides are on the outside.
27,00:02:15,00:02:17,"Did you move this body, David?"
28,00:02:17,00:02:18,"No, sir."
29,00:02:18,00:02:20,Auto Detail hoisted the cab off the kid.
30,00:02:20,00:02:21,"Yeah, but I supervised."
31,00:02:21,00:02:22,No one's touched him.
32,00:02:22,00:02:23,Have you ever seen anything like this?
33,00:02:24,00:02:24,What do you mean?
34,00:02:25,00:02:27,"Well, how many hit-and-runs have you pulled?"
35,00:02:27,00:02:28,Too many to count.
36,00:02:28,00:02:33,How many times have you seen the victim's viscera exposed?
37,00:02:33,00:02:35,First time.
38,00:02:35,00:02:38,There's a first time for everything.
39,00:03:14,00:03:17,(garbled radio transmission)
40,00:03:17,00:03:23,My high school science teacher used to say that your small and large intestines could stretch across the Brooklyn Bridge.
41,00:03:23,00:03:24,But in reality?
42,00:03:24,00:03:25,Only 25 feet combined.
43,00:03:25,00:03:27,Fiction is often more compelling.
44,00:03:27,00:03:30,"We got the eyewitnesses lined up, ready to go."
45,00:03:30,00:03:31,"Testimonials, Jim?"
46,00:03:31,00:03:34,I don't consider that evidence.
47,00:03:34,00:03:35,But easier to clean up.
48,00:03:37,00:03:39,"Keep them all together, David."
49,00:03:39,00:03:41,I'll tuck the viscera in the bio-hazard bag.
50,00:03:41,00:03:42,Good plan.
51,00:03:49,00:03:50,I picked up the taxi at McCarran.
52,00:03:50,00:03:55,"I'm in town on business staying with my cousin, who's a few blocks away."
53,00:03:56,00:03:57,BRASS: Did you see the pedestrian?
54,00:03:57,00:03:59,Crossing the street.
55,00:03:59,00:04:01,I don't think he saw the cab.
56,00:04:01,00:04:03,Did the cabbie see him?
57,00:04:04,00:04:06,"No, he was looking at me."
58,00:04:06,00:04:08,What brings you all the way out here?
59,00:04:08,00:04:13,"I think I yelled, ""Stop,"" but it was too late."
60,00:04:13,00:04:18,"And that's when Rajeeb, the taxi driver tried to leave, to drive away?"
61,00:04:18,00:04:19,"No, no, no, no."
62,00:04:19,00:04:25,He got out of the cab to see what happened and... then he freaked and he got back in and he reached for his radio.
63,00:04:25,00:04:28,That's when the guys attacked him.
64,00:04:28,00:04:29,His radio?
65,00:04:29,00:04:30,He wasn't fleeing the scene?
66,00:04:31,00:04:33,"No, he was calling for help."
67,00:04:33,00:04:34,BRASS: Oh.
68,00:04:34,00:04:39,"Okay, what can you tell me about the men who attacked him?"
69,00:04:43,00:04:46,You always think you'll be a great witness but...
70,00:04:46,00:04:50,(all yelling)
71,00:04:50,00:04:53,There were so many of them and it happened so fast.
72,00:04:56,00:05:00,He was just begging for his life.
73,00:05:00,00:05:05,I couldn't see their faces but I know it was them; all of them.
74,00:05:05,00:05:06,They were the only ones around.
75,00:05:06,00:05:07,"We're heroes, man."
76,00:05:07,00:05:09,They have no respect for our laws.
77,00:05:09,00:05:10,Who?
78,00:05:10,00:05:11,The damn cabbie!
79,00:05:11,00:05:12,"Why, because he's not from Vegas?"
80,00:05:12,00:05:14,"No, because he's not from here, this country."
81,00:05:14,00:05:17,"Oh, and you know that because you saw his birth certificate?"
82,00:05:17,00:05:18,We didn't exactly need to see it.
83,00:05:18,00:05:19,Tell me what you did see.
84,00:05:19,00:05:20,He hit the boy.
85,00:05:23,00:05:25,"Then he hits his brakes, and I figured he's going to stop and do the right thing."
86,00:05:25,00:05:26,"Instead, he jumps back into his cab."
87,00:05:29,00:05:32,"Hey! If it weren't for us, he'd have gotten away."
88,00:05:32,00:05:33,"Citizen's arrest, yo!"
89,00:05:33,00:05:35,People are going to want our autograph.
90,00:05:35,00:05:38,I don't want your autograph but I would like a photo and a bit of your DNA.
91,00:05:38,00:05:39,So line up.
92,00:05:39,00:05:40,What?!
93,00:05:40,00:05:42,"Look, the guy that you ""arrested"" is in critical condition."
94,00:05:42,00:05:45,That makes you all suspects in a battery...
95,00:05:45,00:05:47,Figures. We do something good you guys try to turn around and pin it on us.
96,00:05:48,00:05:51,"Yeah, if we were wearing badges you'd be throwing us a ticker tape parade."
97,00:05:51,00:05:54,If you're wearing badges I'm playing left-wing in the NHL.
98,00:05:54,00:05:55,I know my rights. I don't have to give you squat.
99,00:05:55,00:05:56,"Oh yeah, you're the lawyer."
100,00:05:56,00:05:59,Let me tell you how this goes down if you don't cooperate.
101,00:05:59,00:06:04,You all get a free ride in the cruiser down to the station where I hold you there until the warrants clear.
102,00:06:04,00:06:06,So what's it going to be?
103,00:06:06,00:06:07,It's your choice.
104,00:06:07,00:06:10,Line up... single file.
105,00:06:15,00:06:25,"Say, ""Cheese."" Open up, please."
106,00:06:28,00:06:30,Thank you.
107,00:06:35,00:06:36,WOMAN: He's critical.
108,00:06:36,00:06:40,"Ruptured spleen, collapsed lung, fractured ulna, possible intercranial bleeding."
109,00:06:40,00:06:42,Doctors are still waiting on the labs.
110,00:06:42,00:06:45,Do you have his clothes? His personals are bagged-- top shelf.
111,00:06:45,00:06:47,They're ripped up pretty bad.
112,00:06:47,00:06:48,That's good. That'll help.
113,00:06:48,00:06:51,NURSE: He said he killed a boy-- ran over him?
114,00:06:51,00:06:53,Did he say anything else?
115,00:06:53,00:06:55,"No, that was it."
116,00:07:02,00:07:05,Gene Rayburn.
117,00:07:05,00:07:07,What?
118,00:07:07,00:07:08,Point of reference.
119,00:07:08,00:07:09,Uh...Match Game...
120,00:07:09,00:07:12,"Nipsey Russell, Fannie Flagg Game Show Network."
121,00:07:12,00:07:15,"Look, I don't have time for your humor."
122,00:07:15,00:07:23,Ecklie's got a multiple Warrick tells me his home invasion is my top priority and I'm still backed up on Catherine's no-suspect rape.
123,00:07:23,00:07:25,"One servant, many masters, you know what I'm saying?"
124,00:07:25,00:07:29,Greg... this is your DNA lab.
125,00:07:29,00:07:32,You are the master.
126,00:07:32,00:07:34,We serve you.
127,00:07:36,00:07:38,"Well, your stuff just moved to the top of the pile."
128,00:07:40,00:07:41,What do you got?
129,00:07:41,00:07:45,Individual DNA from a mob attack on a cabbie...
130,00:07:45,00:07:47,and the cabbie's clothes.
131,00:07:47,00:07:55,"""Get ready to match the stars."" Okay, Doc, tell me something I don't know."
132,00:07:55,00:07:56,Okay.
133,00:07:56,00:08:01,"In fourth grade, I dropped out of karate class because a kid half my size made me cry."
134,00:08:01,00:08:03,About the body.
135,00:08:03,00:08:06,No pedestrian fracture.
136,00:08:06,00:08:15,Almost without exception when a pedestrian's hit by a car there's certain expected wounds in his lower extremities most significantly the pedestrian fracture.
137,00:08:19,00:08:23,Tip of the triangle always points in the direction the car was moving.
138,00:08:23,00:08:24,His tibia's intact.
139,00:08:24,00:08:30,"In fact, there's no bruising to the lower extremities."
140,00:08:30,00:08:32,"So, no fractures, no bruising."
141,00:08:33,00:08:34,Cause of death?
142,00:08:34,00:08:36,Chest was crushed.
143,00:08:36,00:08:43,Multiple rib fractures and hence the white bucket you and David filled with his intestines.
144,00:08:43,00:08:45,They literally popped out.
145,00:08:45,00:08:48,So he wasn'thitby the taxi; he was run over?
146,00:08:51,00:08:53,"Well, he would've died anyway."
147,00:08:55,00:08:57,He was stabbed.
148,00:08:58,00:09:01,Clean incised wound to the abdomen.
149,00:09:01,00:09:03,Five inches deep.
150,00:09:10,00:09:15,So how much time elapsed between when he was stabbed and when he encountered the taxi?
151,00:09:15,00:09:19,I can't give you an exact time frame except to say it wasn't immediate...
152,00:09:19,00:09:23,"and before you ask, we don't have an ID but Missing Persons called."
153,00:09:23,00:09:26,A woman called and said her son never came home last night.
154,00:09:26,00:09:29,She's on her way in.
155,00:09:47,00:09:50,"You know you pulled me away from a forensic anthropology seminar, right?"
156,00:09:50,00:09:52,It's required.
157,00:09:52,00:09:54,It's part of the continuing education program.
158,00:09:54,00:09:56,"Well, I'm sorry, but everyone seems to have something to do today."
159,00:09:56,00:09:58,I have a teenager who was run over by a taxi.
160,00:09:58,00:10:01,He wasn't hit by it; that's not what killed him.
161,00:10:01,00:10:02,"He was stabbed, fatally."
162,00:10:02,00:10:05,"For now, I have no ID, no suspects and no primary crime scene."
163,00:10:05,00:10:07,I need you.
164,00:10:09,00:10:11,How can I help?
165,00:10:44,00:10:46,"Hey, Grissom?"
166,00:10:51,00:10:56,The directionality of this drop is facing the boulevard.
167,00:10:56,00:10:59,I think your victim was bleeding before he crossed the street.
168,00:11:16,00:11:18,Blood trail.
169,00:11:18,00:11:20,Want to go for a walk?
170,00:11:36,00:11:38,(camera shutter clicking)
171,00:12:33,00:12:34,SIDLE: Blood leads into the grass.
172,00:12:34,00:12:36,Trail's obscured.
173,00:12:38,00:12:39,Okay.
174,00:12:41,00:12:43,"So, where do we pick up the trail?"
175,00:12:45,00:12:48,"Well, vic's in his teens..."
176,00:12:48,00:12:51,Probably wasn't on the playground.
177,00:12:53,00:12:56,My money's on the basketball court.
178,00:13:15,00:13:19,He crossed Lake Mead Boulevard at 8:15 and it gets dark at 5:00.
179,00:13:19,00:13:20,He was here after dark.
180,00:13:20,00:13:22,And I don't see any lights.
181,00:13:34,00:13:36,Droplets and castoff.
182,00:13:40,00:13:42,This is our primary crime scene.
183,00:13:46,00:13:50,"So, maybe the killer tossed the knife."
184,00:13:52,00:13:55,It's a big dump site.
185,00:13:55,00:13:56,Yeah.
186,00:13:57,00:13:59,"I'll, uh, order up some scent dogs..."
187,00:13:59,00:14:01,get some uniforms.
188,00:14:08,00:14:10,That's him.
189,00:14:10,00:14:11,That's my boy.
190,00:14:11,00:14:13,I'm so sorry.
191,00:14:13,00:14:15,How did something like this happen?
192,00:14:15,00:14:17,He's only 14 years old.
193,00:14:17,00:14:21,"Mrs. Branson, I'm afraid you'll have to talk with the detectives."
194,00:14:21,00:14:23,"Hey, Sara."
195,00:14:23,00:14:25,Hey.
196,00:14:25,00:14:30,You working that case where some mob beat up an Indian cab driver for hitting a kid?
197,00:14:30,00:14:32,Cabbie didn't actually hit the kid.
198,00:14:32,00:14:34,He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
199,00:14:34,00:14:36,You think it was racially motivated?
200,00:14:36,00:14:37,"Yeah, I do."
201,00:14:37,00:14:41,"White mob, white kid, dark-skinned cabbie-- I don't like the math."
202,00:14:41,00:14:42,Yeah.
203,00:14:42,00:14:45,"We got to wait for the science, don't we?"
204,00:14:45,00:14:48,I'm trying.
205,00:14:48,00:14:51,That's the job.
206,00:14:51,00:14:52,Good luck.
207,00:14:56,00:14:59,"Captain, there's a Mrs. Branson here to see you."
208,00:14:59,00:15:01,"Oh good. Send her in, Joe. Thanks."
209,00:15:01,00:15:03,"Mrs. Branson, thank you for coming in..."
210,00:15:03,00:15:05,Have you arrested that taxi driver?
211,00:15:05,00:15:06,He's in intensive care.
212,00:15:06,00:15:07,How did he not see my son?
213,00:15:08,00:15:09,That's a well-lit intersection.
214,00:15:09,00:15:10,My son is five foot six!
215,00:15:10,00:15:13,"Please, Mrs. Branson... please, sit down."
216,00:15:13,00:15:15,Um...
217,00:15:15,00:15:16,(clears throat)
218,00:15:16,00:15:19,Your son was stabbed in Haskell Park and you live on Loring Avenue.
219,00:15:20,00:15:23,My best guess is that he was on his way home when the accident occurred.
220,00:15:23,00:15:24,"No, I don't understand."
221,00:15:24,00:15:28,The taxi didn't kill your son but someone did.
222,00:15:31,00:15:35,Did Todd have any problems that you're aware of?
223,00:15:35,00:15:37,Did he have any problems at school?
224,00:15:37,00:15:38,"No, no, nothing like that."
225,00:15:38,00:15:40,He's a... he's a great kid.
226,00:15:40,00:15:42,He's-He's athletic. He's popular.
227,00:15:42,00:15:43,"He's, uh, he's a good student."
228,00:15:44,00:15:46,We-We moved here from Portland nine months ago.
229,00:15:46,00:15:47,He fit right in.
230,00:15:48,00:15:51,Did you know he was in the park after sundown? No.
231,00:15:51,00:15:52,I thought he was at a friend's for dinner.
232,00:15:53,00:15:55,"He was supposed to call me, but you know teenagers."
233,00:15:55,00:15:57,"Yeah, I do..."
234,00:15:57,00:16:01,"and they don't often confide in their parents, I know."
235,00:16:03,00:16:06,"Uh, I've been on the run from my ex-husband."
236,00:16:06,00:16:09,He's threatened to kill me and my boys.
237,00:16:09,00:16:12,I just try and stay one step ahead of him.
238,00:16:12,00:16:14,When was the last time you saw him?
239,00:16:14,00:16:15,In Portland.
240,00:16:15,00:16:17,He showed up outside of Todd's school.
241,00:16:17,00:16:20,The boys and I were on a bus that evening.
242,00:16:20,00:16:24,"You know, a couple days ago, the phone rang."
243,00:16:24,00:16:25,I answered it.
244,00:16:25,00:16:26,It was him.
245,00:16:26,00:16:32,"I don't know how he found us here but this weekend, the boys and I were going to disappear."
246,00:16:32,00:16:34,Why didn't you call the police?
247,00:16:38,00:16:41,Because you knew we couldn't protect you.
248,00:16:48,00:16:49,(murmurs indistinctly)
249,00:17:14,00:17:17,(metal detector humming)
250,00:17:19,00:17:20,(humming continues)
251,00:17:28,00:17:30,SIDLE: What have you got?
252,00:17:30,00:17:32,You got the gloves on.
253,00:17:43,00:17:47,Looking for a knife; uncover a gun.
254,00:17:47,00:17:50,What is happening to our parks?
255,00:17:50,00:17:51,(howling)
256,00:17:58,00:18:00,Officer...
257,00:18:02,00:18:04,"Back the dogs off, please."
258,00:18:13,00:18:16,Dead body found 20 yards from where our vic was knifed.
259,00:18:16,00:18:18,You think they're related?
260,00:18:18,00:18:20,Well they're related by geography...
261,00:18:20,00:18:24,but for now it's just a dead guy in the park.
262,00:18:50,00:18:51,Hey.
263,00:18:51,00:18:52,Hey.
264,00:18:52,00:18:54,I thought you had a couple days off?
265,00:18:54,00:18:55,"I do, but I left these on my desk."
266,00:18:55,00:18:58,I'm on my way to Circus Circus with five nine-year-olds.
267,00:18:58,00:18:59,It's Lindsey's birthday.
268,00:18:59,00:19:00,Got to wrap a Bridal Barbie.
269,00:19:00,00:19:01,What's a Bridal Barbie?
270,00:19:01,00:19:03,Funny.
271,00:19:03,00:19:06,"Oh, blue... gun shot residue."
272,00:19:06,00:19:08,On our stabbing victim's jacket.
273,00:19:08,00:19:12,So it means that he may have fired the revolver that you and Grissom found in the park?
274,00:19:15,00:19:19,Yeah. Too bad GSR testing can't tie the vic to a particular gun.
275,00:19:19,00:19:21,Right.
276,00:19:21,00:19:23,Hmm... but maybe Grissom can.
277,00:19:24,00:19:24,Grissom?
278,00:19:25,00:19:26,"Yeah, I just passed him in Ballistics."
279,00:19:26,00:19:28,He was meditating on your revolver.
280,00:19:28,00:19:29,Didn't even look up.
281,00:19:29,00:19:30,Excuse me.
282,00:19:30,00:19:31,Mm-hmm.
283,00:19:31,00:19:32,Have fun.
284,00:19:32,00:19:33,Thanks.
285,00:19:41,00:19:44,"You know, you could've waited for me."
286,00:19:45,00:19:46,Take a look at this.
287,00:19:52,00:19:54,Looks like burnt skin.
288,00:19:55,00:19:58,I think maybe someone palmed the cylinder gap.
289,00:20:03,00:20:06,Todd Branson had GSR on his jacket.
290,00:20:06,00:20:09,If we could get his DNA off this revolver we could tie him to this.
291,00:20:09,00:20:11,Burnt skin is useless for DNA.
292,00:20:11,00:20:13,"Yeah, but, what about sweat?"
293,00:20:13,00:20:17,There's a 17% chance of DNA recovery from the shooter's perspiration.
294,00:20:17,00:20:19,17%?
295,00:20:19,00:20:21,Yeah. New paper out of Australia.
296,00:20:21,00:20:22,You haven't seen it?
297,00:20:22,00:20:31,"17% chance of DNA recovery from the grip of a gun, 67% chance from a cigarette 32% chance from the brim of a hat."
298,00:20:31,00:20:33,Would you like a copy?
299,00:20:33,00:20:35,I don't need one.
300,00:20:35,00:20:36,I have you.
301,00:20:38,00:20:40,Swab the pistol grip; get it to DNA.
302,00:20:53,00:20:58,"Albert, did you notice if Todd Branson had any burn marks on his palms?"
303,00:20:58,00:21:00,No.
304,00:21:00,00:21:02,What about this guy?
305,00:21:02,00:21:03,Negative. What are you looking for?
306,00:21:03,00:21:05,A specific injury.
307,00:21:05,00:21:11,"Well, I can't help you with burns but you'll want to check out this guy's right palm."
308,00:21:12,00:21:15,An incised wound.
309,00:21:17,00:21:21,"Well, that's a common injury sustained by knife-wielding killers."
310,00:21:23,00:21:30,"So assuming that this is the man who stabbed Todd Branson, what killed this guy?"
311,00:21:30,00:21:31,A bullet.
312,00:21:31,00:21:34,It's lodged in the left ventricle.
313,00:21:34,00:21:39,I was contemplating my method of extraction when you arrived.
314,00:21:39,00:21:42,You reach in and pull it out.
315,00:21:42,00:21:44,Not if it's only a jacket fragment.
316,00:21:44,00:21:47,Maybe a frangible bullet designed to fragment on impact?
317,00:21:47,00:21:51,That would explain the mystery of the shattered femur.
318,00:21:51,00:21:54,It's covered in copper dust.
319,00:22:01,00:22:06,"I'll remove the heart, peel back the myocardium and get you what's left of that bullet."
320,00:22:09,00:22:12,Did he have a dislocated shoulder?
321,00:22:12,00:22:16,"Yeah, torn musculature, but no inflammatory response."
322,00:22:16,00:22:18,It happened postmortem?
323,00:22:20,00:22:22,"Excuse me, I'm headed over to the hospital."
324,00:22:22,00:22:24,Taxi driver didn't make it.
325,00:22:25,00:22:27,Another one for my table.
326,00:22:27,00:22:36,"Emerson once said ""The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast."" The beast is up for murder."
327,00:22:48,00:22:51,"Hey, buddy, how's it going?"
328,00:22:54,00:22:56,I'm Detective Jim Brass from Las Vegas Police.
329,00:22:56,00:22:57,Is your mother home?
330,00:22:58,00:22:59,No.
331,00:22:59,00:23:01,What's your name?
332,00:23:01,00:23:03,Eric.
333,00:23:03,00:23:05,"Sorry about your brother, Eric."
334,00:23:05,00:23:06,Mom's out getting more boxes.
335,00:23:07,00:23:08,"Yeah, she said that you were moving."
336,00:23:08,00:23:10,Where are you going to?
337,00:23:10,00:23:12,"You know, when I was a kid we moved around a lot."
338,00:23:13,00:23:14,It's not easy.
339,00:23:15,00:23:17,So you're going to be seeing your dad?
340,00:23:17,00:23:19,My dad's dead.
341,00:23:19,00:23:20,Died when I was two.
342,00:23:20,00:23:23,"Hey, Eric, will you do me a favor?"
343,00:23:23,00:23:27,"When you see your mom ask her to give me a call, okay?"
344,00:23:27,00:23:29,Okay.
345,00:23:29,00:23:31,Take care.
346,00:23:35,00:23:36,Is that the frangible?
347,00:23:36,00:23:38,Yep.
348,00:23:38,00:23:42,These were originally used in indoor shooting ranges where lead buildup's a problem.
349,00:23:42,00:23:44,Copper's less toxic than lead.
350,00:23:44,00:23:45,Take a look.
351,00:23:48,00:23:50,"On the left, bullet from the vic's heart."
352,00:23:50,00:23:55,"On the right, bullet test-fired from the revolver recovered at the scene."
353,00:23:55,00:23:57,"Oh, serendipity. Yep."
354,00:23:57,00:23:59,Hey.
355,00:23:59,00:24:00,Just made a match to your revolver.
356,00:24:01,00:24:02,Nice.
357,00:24:02,00:24:04,I ran the serial number through NCIC.
358,00:24:04,00:24:09,"It's registered to a Jonathan Raurk of San Jose, California."
359,00:24:09,00:24:11,John's my ex.
360,00:24:11,00:24:13,Is he in Las Vegas?
361,00:24:13,00:24:14,"BRASS: Well, we, uh..."
362,00:24:14,00:24:24,we found a gun registered to him in the park where your son was murdered but when I spoke to your son Eric he told me that his father died years ago.
363,00:24:25,00:24:27,That's what I told both my boys.
364,00:24:27,00:24:31,I told them that John was killed in a car accident.
365,00:24:31,00:24:36,It's not easy to lie to them like that but every time I move I have to make up some crazy story.
366,00:24:36,00:24:39,I just want them to be able to sleep at night.
367,00:24:39,00:24:45,Ms. Branson we also found a dead body in the park-- a white male in his mid-30s.
368,00:24:45,00:24:48,You think it's John?
369,00:24:48,00:24:51,"We have no ID, but we have a photograph."
370,00:24:56,00:24:58,No...
371,00:24:58,00:24:59,"No, this..."
372,00:24:59,00:25:00,This isn't John.
373,00:25:00,00:25:02,This isn't my ex.
374,00:25:02,00:25:03,This is Stewart.
375,00:25:03,00:25:05,It's Stewart Bradley.
376,00:25:05,00:25:06,He's my boyfriend.
377,00:26:32,00:26:34,Where have you been?
378,00:26:34,00:26:35,I went back to the park.
379,00:26:35,00:26:40,I kept thinking there must be some physical evidence connecting the stabbing to the shooting.
380,00:26:40,00:26:42,GRISSOM: Drag marks?
381,00:26:42,00:26:45,SIDLE: Leading from the basketball court to Stewart Bradley's body.
382,00:26:45,00:26:49,We know Todd was bleeding but there were no blood drops around the drag marks.
383,00:26:49,00:26:51,So you're thinking someone else was there?
384,00:26:51,00:26:57,"Now, the revolver was registered to the boy's biological father but they haven't seen each other in ten years."
385,00:26:57,00:27:00,"Assuming Todd fired the gun, how did he get ahold of it?"
386,00:27:00,00:27:04,"Well, maybe Dad gave it to him behind Mom's back."
387,00:27:04,00:27:09,Or... maybe Todd wasn't the shooter.
388,00:27:09,00:27:11,True.
389,00:27:11,00:27:14,Presence of GSR only places Todd in thevicinityof the gunfire.
390,00:27:14,00:27:21,And since there were no burn marks on Todd's palms evidence is suggesting someone else fired that gun.
391,00:27:21,00:27:24,Which brings us back to Dad.
392,00:27:24,00:27:27,"BRASS: You know something, John, you don't scare me."
393,00:27:27,00:27:39,"According to your ex-wife, you're some kind of monster-- threatening her life setting her car on fire in Boston breaking and entering in Chicago showing up at your kid's school in Portland..."
394,00:27:39,00:27:43,"I don't know, I mean I thought maybe you'd be like the guy inSleeping with the Enemy."
395,00:27:43,00:27:46,"You're more like Gumby, aren't you?"
396,00:27:46,00:27:48,"Look, if this is about my ex..."
397,00:27:48,00:27:50,cop pulled me over outside Moapa.
398,00:27:50,00:27:51,Jane lives in Vegas.
399,00:27:51,00:27:55,"I didn't violate any damn court order, all right?"
400,00:27:55,00:27:56,You know where she lives.
401,00:27:56,00:27:58,Is that a crime?
402,00:27:58,00:28:01,"Yesterday, your son Todd was murdered and that is a crime."
403,00:28:04,00:28:05,Hey!
404,00:28:05,00:28:08,"John, baby I'm not talking about the weather here, man."
405,00:28:08,00:28:11,I'm talking about your son.
406,00:28:11,00:28:14,I haven't seen that kid since he was in his diapers.
407,00:28:14,00:28:16,"Geez, I didn't kill him, if that's where you're going to."
408,00:28:17,00:28:20,"Hey, what about Stewart Bradley?"
409,00:28:20,00:28:22,(speaking indistinctly)
410,00:28:22,00:28:24,He was shot with your gun.
411,00:28:24,00:28:26,Which one?
412,00:28:26,00:28:28,Revolver. Smith &amp;amp; Wesson.
413,00:28:28,00:28:30,"No, I don't have a Smith &amp;amp; Wesson."
414,00:28:31,00:28:32,"It's registered to you, John."
415,00:28:32,00:28:33,Has your name on it.
416,00:28:33,00:28:35,That got stolen.
417,00:28:35,00:28:38,"Oh, you file a police report?"
418,00:28:38,00:28:40,"But I know, you're busy."
419,00:28:40,00:28:41,You forgot. That's okay.
420,00:28:41,00:28:43,You know what I think happened? Here's what I think.
421,00:28:43,00:28:47,"You called up Todd, you said, ""Hey, Todd ""why don't you meet me down at Haskell Park?"
422,00:28:48,00:28:53,"""You know what? Why don't you bring Mom's new boyfriend along?"" No, no. Come on, man, whoa, whoa, hey."
423,00:28:53,00:28:55,You know what?
424,00:28:55,00:28:57,"Last night, I was at Taos, New Mexico, okay?"
425,00:28:57,00:29:00,I didn't cross over until...
426,00:29:00,00:29:01,it was the afternoon in Nevada.
427,00:29:02,00:29:03,Check it out.
428,00:29:03,00:29:05,Adobe Inn.
429,00:29:05,00:29:07,"Watched pay-per-view and I had a pizza, okay?"
430,00:29:08,00:29:10,(sighs)
431,00:29:14,00:29:16,"May I see your hands, please?"
432,00:29:16,00:29:18,You better do what he says.
433,00:29:18,00:29:20,He's in Crime Lab.
434,00:29:24,00:29:25,Can you hold him?
435,00:29:25,00:29:26,He's got some unpaid speeding tickets.
436,00:29:26,00:29:28,There's warrants that have been issued.
437,00:29:28,00:29:30,Is three days good enough?
438,00:29:30,00:29:31,For now.
439,00:29:48,00:29:49,What do you weigh?
440,00:29:49,00:29:52,"Uh, that's between me and my trainer."
441,00:29:53,00:29:54,Do I have to get a scale?
442,00:29:54,00:29:56,"A buck 95, give or take a doughnut."
443,00:29:56,00:29:58,Don't even ask. I'm not telling you.
444,00:29:58,00:30:01,"Warrick, would you lie down on the floor?"
445,00:30:01,00:30:03,I don't get paid enough to play dead.
446,00:30:03,00:30:04,Please?
447,00:30:04,00:30:05,(sighs)
448,00:30:07,00:30:10,"Sara, grab Warrick's right arm."
449,00:30:10,00:30:12,See if you can drag him across the room.
450,00:30:12,00:30:15,"This does have something to do with the case, right?"
451,00:30:15,00:30:17,You don't trust me?
452,00:30:20,00:30:22,(sighs)
453,00:30:25,00:30:26,(grunts)
454,00:30:28,00:30:30,(Brown groans)
455,00:30:30,00:30:31,You're such a drag.
456,00:30:31,00:30:33,(Sidle chuckles)
457,00:30:35,00:30:37,Stay there a minute.
458,00:30:39,00:30:40,Excuse me. Hi.
459,00:30:40,00:30:44,"Judy, right? Judy, would you like to be part of a little experiment?"
460,00:30:44,00:30:45,I-I'm a secretary.
461,00:30:45,00:30:47,"Besides, I heard what you did to Greg's feet."
462,00:30:47,00:30:49,"You'll keep your shoes on, I promise."
463,00:30:51,00:30:52,Can I get up?
464,00:30:52,00:30:53,No. Spin around.
465,00:30:53,00:30:58,"Judy, would you take Warrick by the right arm and try and drag him across the room?"
466,00:30:58,00:30:59,"Hi, Judy."
467,00:30:59,00:31:00,Hi.
468,00:31:02,00:31:04,(grunting)
469,00:31:04,00:31:06,"Hey, I like it gentle, okay?"
470,00:31:06,00:31:08,(grunts)
471,00:31:11,00:31:13,"Thank you, Judy. You've been a big help."
472,00:31:13,00:31:14,Thanks.
473,00:31:14,00:31:16,You can go back to the water cooler.
474,00:31:16,00:31:18,You want to tell me what's going on here?
475,00:31:18,00:31:22,Stewart Bradley had a dislocated shoulder postmortem.
476,00:31:22,00:31:23,He's about the same weight as you.
477,00:31:23,00:31:24,How does your shoulder feel?
478,00:31:24,00:31:26,You saw her dragging me around.
479,00:31:26,00:31:27,"You know, I'm glad I can help."
480,00:31:28,00:31:31,"I, uh, I'm late for the chiropractor's."
481,00:31:31,00:31:32,I'll send you the bill.
482,00:31:33,00:31:34,I get it.
483,00:31:34,00:31:35,I'm bigger than Judy.
484,00:31:35,00:31:38,"In order to get momentum, she had to start and stop."
485,00:31:38,00:31:42,Which could explain Stewart Bradley's postmortem dislocated shoulder.
486,00:31:42,00:31:45,Especially if he was dragged by somebody with limited upper body strength.
487,00:31:45,00:31:47,Where does that get us?
488,00:31:47,00:31:50,"Well, maybe Jan Branson."
489,00:31:50,00:31:54,She's about Judy's size.
490,00:31:54,00:31:57,Why would Jan Branson shoot her boyfriend?
491,00:31:57,00:31:59,He stabbed her son.
492,00:31:59,00:32:01,Motive?
493,00:32:03,00:32:05,I don't know.
494,00:32:05,00:32:07,"But mothers protect their children, don't they?"
495,00:32:07,00:32:09,"Okay... okay, so..."
496,00:32:09,00:32:13,"she sends Todd home, not knowing the severity of his wound."
497,00:32:13,00:32:15,She buries her boyfriend's body.
498,00:32:16,00:32:18,"She ditches the knife, which we still haven't found."
499,00:32:18,00:32:19,She hides the revolver...
500,00:32:19,00:32:23,So perhaps the evidence is in Mrs. Branson's hands.
501,00:32:35,00:32:37,"Mrs. Branson, you got a minute?"
502,00:32:37,00:32:39,"Uh, Eric and I are leaving town."
503,00:32:39,00:32:41,"Well, your ex has been picked up on an unrelated matter."
504,00:32:41,00:32:44,"Even if he makes bail, you still got a day or two head start."
505,00:32:44,00:32:45,Good.
506,00:32:45,00:32:46,"Ms. Branson, may I see your hands?"
507,00:32:47,00:32:48,Excuse me?
508,00:32:48,00:32:50,"Could be important. Palms up, please."
509,00:33:12,00:33:12,"Hi, pal."
510,00:33:13,00:33:13,Hi.
511,00:33:14,00:33:14,"Hey, Eric."
512,00:33:14,00:33:17,This is Mr. Grissom. We work together.
513,00:33:17,00:33:20,"May I see your hands, please?"
514,00:33:20,00:33:22,We have to get going.
515,00:33:22,00:33:26,As soon as Eric shows Mr. Grissom his hands you're on your way.
516,00:33:26,00:33:27,Palms up.
517,00:33:38,00:33:42,Eric...
518,00:33:42,00:33:44,I need to know how you burned your hand.
519,00:33:47,00:33:49,"Look at Mr. Grissom, Eric. Not your mother, okay?"
520,00:33:49,00:33:51,Ms. Karpell.
521,00:33:51,00:33:54,"Eric, it's okay to answer the question."
522,00:33:54,00:33:57,I burned it on an iron.
523,00:33:57,00:34:01,BRASS: I think something a lot more dangerous than that burned your hand.
524,00:34:03,00:34:05,We recovered a gun...
525,00:34:05,00:34:07,in the park.
526,00:34:09,00:34:13,Your burn indicates that your hand was over this gap when the gun was fired.
527,00:34:13,00:34:15,(gunshot)
528,00:34:17,00:34:19,I followed Todd to the park.
529,00:34:19,00:34:22,"Todd, I got your e-mail. What's up?"
530,00:34:22,00:34:23,We're not moving again.
531,00:34:23,00:34:25,I want you to tell Mom you're passing on that promotion.
532,00:34:25,00:34:26,You should discuss this with your mother.
533,00:34:27,00:34:28,She'll do whatever you say. You don't understand.
534,00:34:28,00:34:30,I am not leaving my friends 'cause of you!
535,00:34:30,00:34:33,"Todd, this has nothing to do with me."
536,00:34:33,00:34:35,"Todd, no!"
537,00:34:36,00:34:37,(gunshot)
538,00:34:44,00:34:45,(gunshot)
539,00:34:49,00:34:50,Gotta get home.
540,00:34:50,00:34:52,(gun clatters)
541,00:34:52,00:34:53,Hide the body.
542,00:34:56,00:34:58,I was just looking out for my brother.
543,00:35:06,00:35:08,I swabbed the pistol grip of the revolver.
544,00:35:08,00:35:11,The DNA from the suspect's perspiration isn't a match to Todd's.
545,00:35:11,00:35:13,But it is male.
546,00:35:13,00:35:17,With eight markers in common and familial relationship.
547,00:35:17,00:35:21,GRISSOM: We found gunshot residue on Todd's jacket.
548,00:35:21,00:35:24,We assumed that Todd fired the gun.
549,00:35:24,00:35:27,But I think maybe he was standing next to you whenyoufired the gun.
550,00:35:30,00:35:33,"You didn't go to the park to stop Todd, did you?"
551,00:35:33,00:35:35,He went to the park to stopyou.
552,00:35:35,00:35:38,"Eric, what's up?"
553,00:35:38,00:35:40,"TODD: Whoa! Eric, Eric!"
554,00:35:40,00:35:41,"Eric, don't be stupid."
555,00:35:41,00:35:44,I'm not moving again! Not 'cause of him!
556,00:35:46,00:35:48,(gunshot)
557,00:35:58,00:36:00,Go home!
558,00:36:02,00:36:04,"Where'd you get the revolver, Eric?"
559,00:36:05,00:36:07,JAN: From me.
560,00:36:12,00:36:13,BRASS: Ms. Karpell...
561,00:36:13,00:36:17,"Eric, why don't we step out in the hall for a few minutes."
562,00:36:26,00:36:30,"So, the gun was in your possession and you didn't say anything."
563,00:36:30,00:36:32,"I, um... I had it in a lock box."
564,00:36:32,00:36:37,"And, uh, when I got that call from John a couple of days ago I took it out and I put in my nightstand."
565,00:36:37,00:36:41,I didn't even know it was missing until this morning.
566,00:36:41,00:36:45,"And then, I thought that John must've gotten in the house and taken it."
567,00:36:45,00:36:48,I was sosurethat he was the one who killed Stewart.
568,00:36:48,00:36:53,I've spent the last ten years looking over my shoulder every day.
569,00:36:53,00:36:57,BRASS: Your boyfriend was found carrying a knife the night he died.
570,00:36:57,00:37:03,"I spoke to some of his friends and associates, and no oneever remembers him carrying a knife."
571,00:37:03,00:37:06,SIDLE: Ms. Branson?
572,00:37:06,00:37:08,"You warned your boyfriend about your ex-husband, didn't you?"
573,00:37:08,00:37:13,He asked me what was wrong and I shouldn't have said anything.
574,00:37:13,00:37:15,He panicked.
575,00:37:15,00:37:16,He overreacted.
576,00:37:16,00:37:18,He started carrying a knife.
577,00:37:20,00:37:22,What's going to happen to Eric?
578,00:37:22,00:37:27,"He'll be remanded to a juvenile detention center, awaiting trial."
579,00:37:27,00:37:28,And then?
580,00:37:29,00:37:36,BRASS: If he's convicted of a homicide he'll be sent to a state custodial facility until he's 21.
581,00:38:14,00:38:15,"Where we at, Greg?"
582,00:38:15,00:38:17,"I paged you, like, ten times."
583,00:38:17,00:38:18,I was busy.
584,00:38:18,00:38:19,"Well, so was I."
585,00:38:19,00:38:22,"First, I processed Mr. Khandelwhal's clothing."
586,00:38:22,00:38:28,Then I compared the DNA I lifted from said clothing to the DNA from the Dirty Dozen.
587,00:38:28,00:38:30,All I see is a sheet.
588,00:38:30,00:38:32,But what I do is art.
589,00:38:32,00:38:34,"And now, I'm ready to unveil it."
590,00:38:36,00:38:39,Welcome to the new and improvedMatch Game.
591,00:38:42,00:38:44,"Now, Graham Cooper grabbed Rajeeb's collar..."
592,00:38:44,00:38:47,(men yelling angrily)
593,00:38:47,00:38:52,Claude Allen and Barry Lawrence used their fists...
594,00:38:52,00:38:55,(men clamoring and blows landing)
595,00:38:55,00:39:00,"Joey Gillman, Bill Kendal and Rick Midgen got into it, too."
596,00:39:00,00:39:02,"Very nice presentation, Greg."
597,00:39:02,00:39:04,What about the others? They all participated.
598,00:39:04,00:39:05,They even bragged about it.
599,00:39:05,00:39:11,"Well, only six of the 12 left behind their epithelials when their skin made contact with the vic's clothing."
600,00:39:11,00:39:15,I've got no physical evidence to tie the others to the crime.
601,00:39:36,00:39:38,(indistinct conversation echoing eerily)
602,00:39:44,00:39:47,Stop!
603,00:39:47,00:39:48,"(tires screeching, body thudding)"
604,00:40:01,00:40:05,Hey!
605,00:40:05,00:40:08,(mob yelling)
606,00:40:13,00:40:15,GRISSOM: The mob mentality...
607,00:40:15,00:40:20,relieves individuals from having to distinguish between right and wrong.
608,00:40:20,00:40:25,"Anonymity shields them from prosecution, though."
609,00:40:25,00:40:27,"Yeah, six of them, to be exact."
610,00:40:29,00:40:33,"Unfortunately, physical evidence is limited by human action."
611,00:40:33,00:40:37,"Well, nothing's absolute, Gil... even forensics."
612,00:40:37,00:40:40,"Yeah, well..."
613,00:40:40,00:40:43,this is as far as we can take it.
614,00:40:43,00:40:45,It's up to you guys.
615,00:40:45,00:40:51,"BRASS: The physical evidence confirms that you're the ""hero"" who pulled the driver out of the cab."
616,00:40:51,00:40:52,"I'd do it again, too."
617,00:40:52,00:40:55,"Mr. Cooper, why don't we just hear what Captain Brass has to say."
618,00:40:55,00:40:57,You're looking at first degree murder.
619,00:40:57,00:40:58,What?!
620,00:40:58,00:41:01,Mr. Khandelwhal didn't make it.
621,00:41:05,00:41:07,(sighs)
622,00:41:07,00:41:09,"And, for the record, he didn't hit that boy."
623,00:41:10,00:41:11,He wasn't trying to flee the scene.
624,00:41:12,00:41:15,He was reaching for his radio trying to call for help.
625,00:41:15,00:41:17,You know who the real hero of this is?
626,00:41:17,00:41:20,Rajeeb Khandelwhal.
627,00:41:20,00:41:23,The taxi driver.
628,00:41:23,00:41:25,So...
629,00:41:25,00:41:28,what does that make you?
630,00:41:30,00:41:32,D.A. willing to deal?
631,00:41:35,00:41:37,(heavy sigh)
632,00:41:39,00:41:41,(over speaker): We want your buddies.
633,00:41:41,00:41:43,"I mean, either you talk or they'll talk."
634,00:41:43,00:41:45,"I mean, it doesn't matter."
635,00:41:45,00:41:46,"And the clock is ticking, so..."
