0,00:00:01,00:00:04,(upbeat music plays)
1,00:00:20,00:00:23,(music continues playing)
2,00:00:27,00:00:30,"(music continues, playing on radio)"
3,00:00:58,00:01:00,(gasping)
4,00:01:12,00:01:14,(shower running)
5,00:01:52,00:01:54,Killer forgot we're in a drought.
6,00:01:59,00:02:01,LANGSTON: What the hell is that?
7,00:02:01,00:02:03,"Well, this didn't occur naturally."
8,00:02:03,00:02:05,"Oh, what tipped you off?"
9,00:02:05,00:02:08,The two half hitches and a bow?
10,00:02:08,00:02:12,"No, the fact that the small intestine is tied around the spleen."
11,00:02:12,00:02:15,It's red and green and looks like a Christmas present.
12,00:02:15,00:02:19,"All right, the case was in backlog pending autopsy."
13,00:02:20,00:02:26,Joseph Bigelow was found in an alley off of Charleston and Avert.
14,00:02:26,00:02:28,There were no signs of foul play.
15,00:02:28,00:02:31,Typical dead bum case. Autopsy was pro forma.
16,00:02:31,00:02:33,Joseph Bigelow.
17,00:02:33,00:02:35,I've heard that name before.
18,00:02:35,00:02:38,"Well, I bet you've never seen this before."
19,00:02:38,00:02:40,WILLOWS: Okay.
20,00:02:41,00:02:42,Not so typical dead bum case.
21,00:02:42,00:02:44,Is that C.O.D.?
22,00:02:44,00:02:46,"ROBBINS: No, blood vessels are occluded."
23,00:02:46,00:02:48,He died of natural causes.
24,00:02:48,00:02:50,Myocardial infarct due to atherosclerosis.
25,00:02:51,00:02:54,"I'd have a heart attack, too, if someone did that to me."
26,00:02:54,00:02:56,Intestines show no vital tissue reaction.
27,00:02:56,00:02:58,No signs of peritonitis.
28,00:02:58,00:03:00,He was mutilated postmortem.
29,00:03:00,00:03:05,"So, he died, then someone cut into him and gift-wrapped his guts?"
30,00:03:05,00:03:07,Only he wasn't cut into.
31,00:03:07,00:03:09,There are no visible incisions on his body.
32,00:03:09,00:03:12,LANGSTON: One thing's for sure.
33,00:03:12,00:03:15,He didn't do this to himself.
34,00:03:47,00:03:48,WOMAN: Can't I just go?
35,00:03:48,00:03:50,I want to get out of here.
36,00:03:50,00:03:51,"BRASS: Just want ask a few questions, all right?"
37,00:03:51,00:03:53,Just a few questions. Okay?
38,00:03:53,00:03:55,(sirens chirping intermittently)
39,00:03:55,00:03:56,(voice breaking): I just want to go home.
40,00:03:57,00:03:58,How did you know Ryan Lester?
41,00:03:58,00:04:00,He-He was my boss.
42,00:04:00,00:04:01,He was your boss.
43,00:04:01,00:04:03,What kind of work do you do?
44,00:04:03,00:04:05,Entertainment.
45,00:04:05,00:04:07,Entertainment.
46,00:04:07,00:04:10,"So, did you and Ryan have a relationship outside of work?"
47,00:04:10,00:04:12,We hooked up a few times. Okay...
48,00:04:13,00:04:15,But that... that was a long time ago.
49,00:04:15,00:04:17,At least a couple of weeks.
50,00:04:17,00:04:19,"All right, so tell me what happened."
51,00:04:19,00:04:21,I was taking a hot shower.
52,00:04:21,00:04:22,I was gonna go home and study.
53,00:04:23,00:04:25,(gasping) Ryan.
54,00:04:25,00:04:26,Not funny. What?
55,00:04:26,00:04:29,Get out.
56,00:04:29,00:04:31,"The view is ""def"" better from this angle."
57,00:04:31,00:04:33,Ew.
58,00:04:33,00:04:35,"BRASS:Okay, so he got in the shower with you with his clothes on?"
59,00:04:36,00:04:38,"Yeah, he was freaky like that."
60,00:04:38,00:04:40,And there was no fight? There was no struggle?
61,00:04:40,00:04:44,"I've learned to deal with Ryan's ""assitude,"" as long as I get a fat check at the end of the week."
62,00:04:44,00:04:46,"All right, keep going. What else?"
63,00:04:46,00:04:48,I went into the bedroom to get changed.
64,00:04:52,00:04:54,(thudding in distance)
65,00:04:54,00:04:56,Ryan?
66,00:04:56,00:04:58,The power's out again.
67,00:04:58,00:05:02,"WOMAN: I thought he fell or something, so I went in to check on him."
68,00:05:03,00:05:05,(screaming)
69,00:05:05,00:05:08,Help!
70,00:05:08,00:05:09,Somebody help! Help!
71,00:05:10,00:05:11,Stop!
72,00:05:13,00:05:15,"Stop, please help!"
73,00:05:15,00:05:16,(sobbing): Help!
74,00:05:16,00:05:17,Are you all right?
75,00:05:17,00:05:18,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy, easy..."
76,00:05:19,00:05:21,And if... if that guy hadn't seen me...
77,00:05:23,00:05:24,"...then I'd probably be dead, too."
78,00:05:24,00:05:26,"Well, you're lucky. You're okay."
79,00:05:26,00:05:28,"Now, the CSI is going to want to take your clothes."
80,00:05:28,00:05:29,"You're okay with that, right?"
81,00:05:29,00:05:31,"Yeah. Okay, now just wait right here."
82,00:05:31,00:05:33,Stay right there.
83,00:05:34,00:05:35,"Uh, Mr. Wincroft?"
84,00:05:35,00:05:37,"Wincroft, yes. Wincroft, right."
85,00:05:37,00:05:40,"Okay, so, the CSI's gonna want to take your clothes, too."
86,00:05:40,00:05:41,"You're all right with that, right?"
87,00:05:41,00:05:43,"Oh, yeah."
88,00:05:43,00:05:44,You're the one who called 911?
89,00:05:44,00:05:47,"Uh, yeah, I'm the Neighborhood Watch captain. Mm-hmm."
90,00:05:47,00:05:49,"Here, let me give you these. No, no, no."
91,00:05:49,00:05:50,"Keep your shirt on, captain."
92,00:05:50,00:05:53,We're gonna do it down at the station.
93,00:05:53,00:05:55,(indistinct background radio communication)
94,00:06:01,00:06:04,(siren wailing into distance)
95,00:06:04,00:06:05,"Hey, give me some light here, will you?"
96,00:06:26,00:06:27,(radio chirps)
97,00:06:27,00:06:29,"Hey, somebody turned the power off."
98,00:06:30,00:06:32,I think I might've pulled a partial off the main breaker.
99,00:06:33,00:06:35,I'm turning the power back on now.
100,00:06:52,00:06:54,(camera shutter clicking)
101,00:07:24,00:07:27,What is going on in here?
102,00:07:27,00:07:28,Sorry I'm late.
103,00:07:29,00:07:33,The freezer is still on the fritz from when those ROC goons tore up the place.
104,00:07:33,00:07:36,"It's not like we can hang a ""closed"" sign on the door or anything."
105,00:07:36,00:07:39,"Hey, what kind of a house has a sign-in board, man?"
106,00:07:39,00:07:41,I don't know.
107,00:07:41,00:07:43,Where am I going?
108,00:07:43,00:07:44,"Oh, yeah."
109,00:07:44,00:07:45,"Yeah, sorry, Super Dave."
110,00:07:45,00:07:47,Follow me.
111,00:07:51,00:07:52,End of the hallway.
112,00:07:57,00:08:02,"I wonder if the bedroom across the hall has a Webcam, too."
113,00:08:02,00:08:05,"Uh, I'm pretty sure it does."
114,00:08:05,00:08:07,How would you know something like that?
115,00:08:07,00:08:10,"Nick, could I tell you something personal?"
116,00:08:10,00:08:12,Maybe.
117,00:08:12,00:08:19,Mrs. Phillips and I occasionally enjoy a little... live stimulation to get us in the mood.
118,00:08:19,00:08:25,"What I'm saying is, uh, I'm intimately familiar with this particular bedroom."
119,00:08:25,00:08:27,I subscribe to the Web site.
120,00:08:27,00:08:31,"Well, try and maintain your objectivity."
121,00:08:31,00:08:34,Of course.
122,00:08:34,00:08:36,(sighs)
123,00:08:37,00:08:39,(camera shutter clicks)
124,00:08:41,00:08:43,After you.
125,00:08:43,00:08:45,David. I missed your face.
126,00:08:45,00:08:46,"Aw, it's good to see you."
127,00:08:46,00:08:47,How's your wife?
128,00:08:47,00:08:48,Good. Great. Why?
129,00:08:48,00:08:49,What have you heard?
130,00:08:52,00:08:54,"The, um, back door is broken."
131,00:08:54,00:08:56,It's probably the killer's entrance and exit point.
132,00:08:56,00:09:00,Looks like a men's size ten to 12.
133,00:09:00,00:09:03,There's not much detail in these impressions.
134,00:09:03,00:09:04,STOKES: Not much?
135,00:09:04,00:09:06,There's no detail.
136,00:09:06,00:09:08,"It's kind of weird, actually."
137,00:09:08,00:09:10,SIDLE: Maybe his shoes had smooth soles.
138,00:09:10,00:09:12,Or maybe he was doing what we do.
139,00:09:12,00:09:13,Which means he planned this out.
140,00:09:13,00:09:15,Great.
141,00:09:15,00:09:16,"PHILLIPS: Hey, guys."
142,00:09:16,00:09:20,"We've got a single laceration here, left to right."
143,00:09:20,00:09:24,Sliced the carotid-jugular complex.
144,00:09:24,00:09:26,This guy didn't cut too deep.
145,00:09:26,00:09:29,"Just deep enough, actually."
146,00:09:29,00:09:30,Efficient.
147,00:09:35,00:09:38,"ROBBINS: You're in a room, no doors, no windows."
148,00:09:38,00:09:40,How do you get out?
149,00:09:40,00:09:43,Same way you got in. (chuckles)
150,00:09:43,00:09:44,"Mm, I heard it this way."
151,00:09:44,00:09:47,"You're in a room with no doors, no windows, there's a chain saw and a table."
152,00:09:48,00:09:50,How do you get out?
153,00:09:50,00:09:51,I give up.
154,00:09:51,00:09:54,You cut the table in half with the chain saw.
155,00:09:54,00:09:59,"Two halves make a...? ""Hole."" Out you go. Brother."
156,00:09:59,00:10:01,(laughing)
157,00:10:01,00:10:11,"Well, whoever did this had to get in and out through a ""hole."" Well, think it was a natural opening or did he make one?"
158,00:10:11,00:10:16,"Either way, he had to use an endoscope or a laparoscope."
159,00:10:20,00:10:21,Well...
160,00:10:21,00:10:25,"here at the navel, that could be a laparoscopic opening."
161,00:10:25,00:10:26,"Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm."
162,00:10:30,00:10:32,Hmm... Internally...
163,00:10:32,00:10:37,"the incision is open, but externally, it's fused."
164,00:10:39,00:10:45,"I don't see any sutures, so probably used surgical glue."
165,00:10:45,00:10:48,Whoever did this had to have access to medical equipment.
166,00:10:48,00:10:53,"A doctor, med student, surgical nurse."
167,00:10:53,00:10:55,This isn't medicine.
168,00:10:55,00:10:59,"So, I hear you're the Neighborhood Watch captain, is that right?"
169,00:10:59,00:11:01,Yeah.
170,00:11:01,00:11:04,"Well, since the housing crash, you know, I've had to really step up my patrols."
171,00:11:04,00:11:10,"You know, the banks nowadays-- they're selling, and renting out these houses to anyone who has a dime."
172,00:11:10,00:11:11,"Yeah, tell me about it."
173,00:11:11,00:11:13,I got the same problem in my neighborhood.
174,00:11:13,00:11:18,"Obviously, I could've done a better job, being that someone was killed."
175,00:11:18,00:11:19,"Well, the girl wasn't."
176,00:11:19,00:11:20,She claims you saved her life.
177,00:11:20,00:11:22,"Well, I do my best."
178,00:11:22,00:11:25,"You know, I pick up my flashlight the minute I come home from work."
179,00:11:25,00:11:26,Good man.
180,00:11:26,00:11:28,"Here, have a seat. Oh, sure."
181,00:11:29,00:11:34,"So, tell me, how well did you know Ryan Lester?"
182,00:11:34,00:11:38,"Not really. Uh, I mean, I've seen him coming and going."
183,00:11:38,00:11:45,"You know, the Greene family owned that house before him-- good friends-- until they lost their jobs and had to foreclose."
184,00:11:45,00:11:47,"Yeah, man, everybody's feeling it."
185,00:11:47,00:11:51,"I'm so underwater in my house, I should be wearing scuba gear in there, you know what I mean?"
186,00:11:51,00:11:53,And neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore.
187,00:11:53,00:11:54,Yeah.
188,00:11:55,00:11:57,"You know, we even got a peeper in our neighborhood."
189,00:11:57,00:11:58,Really? Yeah.
190,00:11:58,00:12:04,"I mean, I haven't seen him yet, but a few of the neighbors, you know, that are left, they said they saw him lurking around."
191,00:12:04,00:12:06,"Do you think, uh, anybody could give me description?"
192,00:12:06,00:12:09,"Well, the minute I get something, you're my first call."
193,00:12:14,00:12:17,"Can you hold out your index finger for me, please?"
194,00:12:20,00:12:22,(electronic blipping)
195,00:12:26,00:12:29,Why is your print on the circuit breaker at Ryan's house?
196,00:12:29,00:12:31,Because I'm always turning it back on.
197,00:12:31,00:12:34,I told that cop earlier-- the lights are always going out.
198,00:12:34,00:12:38,"With all the Webcams, curling irons, and blow-dryers, the thing overloads."
199,00:12:38,00:12:41,Can you hold out your hands for me?
200,00:12:41,00:12:43,Ryan's too cheap to call an electrician.
201,00:12:43,00:12:45,Did you touch the switch last night?
202,00:12:46,00:12:48,No. I don't do anything at night except go to my car.
203,00:12:49,00:12:50,There's a Peeping Tom in the neighborhood.
204,00:12:50,00:12:52,Have you seen him? No.
205,00:12:52,00:12:54,"If I had, he'd have my Mace in his face."
206,00:12:54,00:12:56,Ryan said he's seen him running from the house.
207,00:12:56,00:12:59,Did Ryan happen to tell you what this peeper looked like?
208,00:12:59,00:13:02,You ever seen Marilyn Manson?
209,00:13:04,00:13:09,"SANDERS: So, I've been scanning through this Webcam footage for the past couple hours."
210,00:13:09,00:13:11,It's a tough job.
211,00:13:11,00:13:12,I manage.
212,00:13:12,00:13:16,"By the way, congrats on your new gig,supervisor."
213,00:13:16,00:13:17,You deserve it.
214,00:13:17,00:13:19,"Thanks, Greg."
215,00:13:19,00:13:24,"So, the, uh, Webcam girls turn off their cameras at the end of their shift."
216,00:13:24,00:13:27,So Marnie's camera was off when Ryan bit it.
217,00:13:27,00:13:29,Check this out.
218,00:13:29,00:13:31,The curtains moved.
219,00:13:31,00:13:32,I don't see any hands.
220,00:13:32,00:13:35,"So, unless it was the AC, what is it?"
221,00:13:36,00:13:37,A ghost?
222,00:13:37,00:13:42,"Looks like there's something behind the curtain, covering the windows."
223,00:13:42,00:13:44,Probably to keep the light out.
224,00:13:44,00:13:46,And anybody from looking in.
225,00:13:46,00:13:47,Not so sure about that.
226,00:13:59,00:14:02,Maybe it is a ghost.
227,00:14:07,00:14:09,Ray.
228,00:14:09,00:14:12,I remember how I know this Bigelow guy.
229,00:14:12,00:14:15,"Years ago, I used to catch this lounge act at the Riv."
230,00:14:15,00:14:19,"Joey-- ""Joe Joe"" Bigelow was always there."
231,00:14:19,00:14:24,"Sitting in the back with his dirty tux on, playing air piano to every tune. Mm-hmm."
232,00:14:24,00:14:26,The rumor is that he...
233,00:14:26,00:14:28,he really did play piano for Dean Martin.
234,00:14:28,00:14:30,All the old-timers knew him. Wow.
235,00:14:30,00:14:38,"Every day, Joe Joe would walk from the Nugget to the Mandalay and back again."
236,00:14:38,00:14:41,"Just looking for some ivories to tickle, chasing the dream."
237,00:14:41,00:14:45,I guess he hadn't heard that live piano players went the way of the dollar martini.
238,00:14:45,00:14:53,"Well, my point is, is that he was on the streets, sleeping in different alleys, but always within spitting distance of the Strip."
239,00:14:53,00:14:56,Here's Las Vegas Boulevard.
240,00:14:56,00:14:58,Here's where the body was found. So?
241,00:14:58,00:15:02,Joe Joe was a Strip snob.
242,00:15:02,00:15:05,He wouldn't be caught dead west of the 15. But he was caught dead there.
243,00:15:05,00:15:11,Which suggests that that is where his surgeon works or lives.
244,00:15:11,00:15:14,It also suggests that...
245,00:15:14,00:15:16,he didn't know Joey.
246,00:15:16,00:15:18,And that he selected him at random.
247,00:15:24,00:15:28,"STOKES: Now, looks like the peeper jimmied the window open."
248,00:15:28,00:15:31,Cut himself a handy little flap in the cardboard.
249,00:15:31,00:15:33,"Yeah, so he could see the ladies in action."
250,00:15:33,00:15:37,Closed... never really noticed it.
251,00:15:37,00:15:39,But open...
252,00:15:39,00:15:41,I can see everything.
253,00:15:41,00:15:45,There's some white trace around the peephole.
254,00:15:45,00:15:47,Kind of looks like makeup.
255,00:15:47,00:15:51,Marnie Bennett said that the peeper looked like Marilyn Manson.
256,00:15:51,00:15:52,He wears a lot of makeup.
257,00:15:52,00:15:54,I'll swab it.
258,00:15:57,00:15:58,"Hey, now what do you see?"
259,00:15:59,00:16:00,Nothing.
260,00:16:00,00:16:03,He would've had to...
261,00:16:03,00:16:08,move the curtains to the side to enjoy the show.
262,00:16:08,00:16:10,Which is what we saw on the Webcam.
263,00:16:37,00:16:38,Aha!
264,00:16:38,00:16:41,The old wire hanger through the peephole trick.
265,00:16:41,00:16:42,(chuckling): Yeah.
266,00:16:42,00:16:46,And I have a pretty good idea where this old wire hanger came from.
267,00:16:46,00:16:48,"Hey, Jim, this is Charlie-05."
268,00:16:48,00:16:51,"I need a warrant for Diamond Star Cleaners, please, sir."
269,00:16:54,00:16:56,(doorbell rings)
270,00:16:56,00:17:00,This is the only household in the development that uses Diamond Star Cleaners.
271,00:17:01,00:17:03,Faith Mason?
272,00:17:03,00:17:06,"Yes. Ma'am, is there anyone else inside?"
273,00:17:06,00:17:07,What's this about?
274,00:17:08,00:17:11,It's a warrant to search your house.
275,00:17:13,00:17:15,"Uh, my son is upstairs."
276,00:17:15,00:17:16,"I'll get him. STOKES: No, no."
277,00:17:16,00:17:17,"That's all right, Mrs. Mason."
278,00:17:17,00:17:19,We'll get him. What's his name?
279,00:17:19,00:17:20,Craig.
280,00:17:20,00:17:21,Craig. Okay.
281,00:17:22,00:17:23,"Come on, Sara."
282,00:17:25,00:17:28,(black metal music blasting in distance)
283,00:17:37,00:17:39,(black metal music grows louder)
284,00:17:52,00:17:54,(knocking on door) Craig!
285,00:17:54,00:17:56,Las Vegas Police.
286,00:17:56,00:17:57,(music blaring)
287,00:17:57,00:17:59,Craig!
288,00:17:59,00:18:02,Get up! Las Vegas Police!
289,00:18:02,00:18:04,(loud music continues)
290,00:18:12,00:18:14,(music stops)
291,00:18:14,00:18:16,Craig!
292,00:18:17,00:18:19,"Craig, come on, buddy!"
293,00:18:19,00:18:21,Time to wake up!
294,00:18:23,00:18:25,Don't touch me.
295,00:18:25,00:18:26,Las Vegas Police.
296,00:18:26,00:18:27,We need you to step outside.
297,00:18:28,00:18:29,(scoffs) You aren't the police.
298,00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yeah, that's all right, we brought one with us."
299,00:18:31,00:18:32,Get your ass up.
300,00:18:32,00:18:36,I said get up!
301,00:18:41,00:18:44,Jeepers creepers.
302,00:18:50,00:18:55,Does anybody believe in sunlight in this neighborhood?
303,00:19:07,00:19:09,"(click, beep)"
304,00:19:16,00:19:18,"Hey, Sara."
305,00:19:18,00:19:19,Ten and a halves.
306,00:19:19,00:19:22,Same size as the show impressions at the scene.
307,00:19:27,00:19:29,I have seen this mask before.
308,00:19:29,00:19:30,Is it from a horror movie or something?
309,00:19:30,00:19:32,This job is a horror movie.
310,00:19:32,00:19:34,I don't even watch them anymore.
311,00:19:39,00:19:41,Hey.
312,00:19:41,00:19:44,I think we're in the right place.
313,00:20:05,00:20:06,(Sidle groans)
314,00:20:06,00:20:07,(clears throat)
315,00:20:07,00:20:09,What is it?
316,00:20:09,00:20:11,"It's, um..."
317,00:20:12,00:20:14,(groans)
318,00:20:14,00:20:18,"Satanists have been known to collect dead crows, to keep the smell of death around them."
319,00:20:18,00:20:20,How do you know that? Grissom?
320,00:20:20,00:20:21,Ozzy Osbourne.
321,00:20:21,00:20:23,I loved Black Sabbath.
322,00:20:23,00:20:24,For a summer.
323,00:20:24,00:20:29,"Well, in that case, I guess we're lucky the head's still on it."
324,00:20:31,00:20:33,Sara.
325,00:20:33,00:20:36,"Did Ozzy, uh, say anything about collecting dead bodies?"
326,00:20:46,00:20:48,(chuckles)
327,00:20:48,00:20:50,What?
328,00:20:50,00:20:52,(sighs)
329,00:20:53,00:20:54,Scary masks.
330,00:20:54,00:20:55,Rubber hands.
331,00:20:55,00:20:57,Arts and crafts.
332,00:20:57,00:21:00,What's this kid's name again?
333,00:21:00,00:21:02,Craig Mason.
334,00:21:02,00:21:05,As in Judge Mason?
335,00:21:05,00:21:07,Aka Paul Millander.
336,00:21:07,00:21:11,WILLOWS: You're never going to believe who Judge Mason's fingerprints match.
337,00:21:11,00:21:12,GRISSOM: His real name is Paul Millander.
338,00:21:12,00:21:15,He's a serial killer with a split personality.
339,00:21:15,00:21:18,This is our best-seller-- even used my own hand for the mold.
340,00:21:20,00:21:22,MRS. MASON: I'd like you to meet our son Craig.
341,00:21:22,00:21:25,You'll be safe now.
342,00:21:26,00:21:30,Craig Mason is Paul Millander's adopted son.
343,00:21:30,00:21:31,Son of Millander.
344,00:21:41,00:21:43,Nature or nurture-- you choose.
345,00:21:43,00:21:46,"Either way, this kid Mason's a freak."
346,00:21:46,00:21:47,And not very cooperative.
347,00:21:47,00:21:50,The only thing he hates worse than cops is CSIs.
348,00:21:50,00:21:53,He even mentioned Grissom's name a few times.
349,00:21:53,00:21:55,"Well, then I won't mention that I'm Mrs. Grissom."
350,00:21:55,00:21:56,"Oh, you took his last name?"
351,00:21:56,00:21:57,"Uh, no."
352,00:21:57,00:21:59,"Uh, turns out we do not have a murder weapon."
353,00:21:59,00:22:03,"According to Wendy, the blood on Craig's straightedge does not belong to Ryan Lester."
354,00:22:03,00:22:05,"Well, maybe there was more than one knife."
355,00:22:05,00:22:08,"I'll call Canine, have them meet them at the scene."
356,00:22:08,00:22:10,Thank you.
357,00:22:10,00:22:12,My son didn't do anything wrong.
358,00:22:12,00:22:16,"Mrs. Mason, I am only here to collect evidence."
359,00:22:16,00:22:18,I married a judge.
360,00:22:18,00:22:21,"Craig's father was a judge, not a serial killer."
361,00:22:21,00:22:22,This is not about Craig's father.
362,00:22:23,00:22:24,You know damn well it is.
363,00:22:24,00:22:27,Craig shouldn't be punished for Paul Millander's sins.
364,00:22:27,00:22:31,I can assure you he will only be punished if he has broken the law.
365,00:22:31,00:22:33,"Now, if you'll please excuse me."
366,00:22:35,00:22:38,Craig.
367,00:22:38,00:22:39,Hi.
368,00:22:39,00:22:43,I need your clothes and a DNA sample.
369,00:22:44,00:22:46,"Look, don't force me to do this the hard way."
370,00:22:46,00:22:49,"Can you sit up, please?"
371,00:22:51,00:22:59,"I know you've had a hard childhood, and you've probably been scrutinized at every school that you've been to, and to you, I'm just another one of those people who wants to put you under a microscope, but..."
372,00:22:59,00:23:02,Just shut up and take my DNA.
373,00:23:12,00:23:14,(sniffing)
374,00:23:27,00:23:29,"(dog whining, panting)"
375,00:23:29,00:23:31,(dog barks)
376,00:23:31,00:23:33,STOKES: Where's he goin'? This is the Mason house.
377,00:23:33,00:23:34,I don't know!
378,00:23:52,00:23:54,Get that dog back. Get that dog back.
379,00:23:54,00:23:57,"Clear it, Mitch."
380,00:24:04,00:24:06,His throat's slit just like Ryan Lester's.
381,00:24:06,00:24:08,"SANDERS: Dried blood, fixed lividity."
382,00:24:08,00:24:10,Been here at least 24 hours.
383,00:24:10,00:24:11,MITCH: Code four.
384,00:24:12,00:24:13,You're going to want to see this.
385,00:24:21,00:24:23,Whoa-ho-ho!
386,00:24:30,00:24:32,The plot thickens.
387,00:24:32,00:24:35,"Porn house, drug house."
388,00:24:35,00:24:36,Millander house in between.
389,00:24:36,00:24:39,They must throw one hell of a block party.
390,00:24:41,00:24:45,"ROBBINS: A drug dealer named Kilo, 25."
391,00:24:45,00:24:47,I compared his neck wound to Ryan Lester's.
392,00:24:47,00:24:49,They're virtually identical.
393,00:24:49,00:24:52,Both incised wounds about an inch deep.
394,00:24:52,00:24:55,"Result of an extremely sharp, thin blade."
395,00:24:55,00:24:58,But there's something additional with Mr. Kilo.
396,00:24:58,00:25:01,Parallel abrasions on both sides of the incision.
397,00:25:01,00:25:06,Murder weapon was probably a utility knife or box cutter.
398,00:25:06,00:25:12,"STOKES: If the same weapon was used on both victims, then why didn't we find similar abrasions on Ryan Lester here?"
399,00:25:12,00:25:14,Might be a matter of pressure.
400,00:25:14,00:25:17,Killer pressed harder on Mr. Kilo.
401,00:25:17,00:25:21,He jammed the body of the weapon right up against his neck.
402,00:25:21,00:25:23,T.O.D.'s?
403,00:25:23,00:25:26,Both men were killed between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.
404,00:25:26,00:25:28,I can't tell you who was first.
405,00:25:28,00:25:33,"Well, either way, we've got ourselves a spree killer."
406,00:25:33,00:25:42,"ANCHORWOMAN: This afternoon while investigators were at the scene of the Ryan Lester homicide, a police dog lead them to a second murder victim located several houses down."
407,00:25:42,00:25:49,"Police have a suspect in custody related to the murder of Ryan Lester, who was attacked and killed in his own home last night."
408,00:25:49,00:25:53,Officials have not confirmed a connection between the two murders.
409,00:25:53,00:25:58,(door opening) And police are asking the public to please contact the Las Vegas Police Department with any...
410,00:25:58,00:26:00,Where are you taking him?
411,00:26:00,00:26:01,CCDC.
412,00:26:01,00:26:04,"Uh, we have evidence placing your son at the scene of the first murder."
413,00:26:04,00:26:07,"For the moment, we're holding him under NRS-200.603."
414,00:26:07,00:26:09,It's peeping.
415,00:26:10,00:26:12,Did you really do that?
416,00:26:12,00:26:15,Did you look into other people's homes?
417,00:26:15,00:26:16,Yeah.
418,00:26:18,00:26:20,But I didn't kill anyone.
419,00:26:20,00:26:22,I was just looking at the girls.
420,00:26:22,00:26:23,That's why they do it.
421,00:26:23,00:26:26,I just wasn't paying.
422,00:26:29,00:26:31,"Mom, just bail me out, okay?"
423,00:26:32,00:26:33,Mom?
424,00:26:33,00:26:35,"Mom, you-you believe me, don't you?"
425,00:26:35,00:26:36,Mom!
426,00:26:36,00:26:39,Mom! Mom!
427,00:26:39,00:26:43,"Mom, I didn't do it! Your son's going to need a lawyer."
428,00:26:44,00:26:46,(stifled sobbing)
429,00:26:55,00:26:57,(door opening)
430,00:26:57,00:27:01,"I'm learning when I can't find you, I should look down here."
431,00:27:01,00:27:02,This is very difficult.
432,00:27:03,00:27:10,It's like attempting to tie a cherry stem into a knot with your tongue.
433,00:27:10,00:27:12,I can do that... after a few drinks.
434,00:27:12,00:27:15,(sighing)
435,00:27:15,00:27:18,Our Dr. Jekyll has some remarkable surgical skills.
436,00:27:18,00:27:20,Dr. Jekyll?
437,00:27:20,00:27:21,Whoever mutilated Mr. Bigelow.
438,00:27:21,00:27:28,"What remarkable surgeon steals a dead man off the streets, practices on him, and then dumps him in an alley?"
439,00:27:28,00:27:30,No surgeon I ever met.
440,00:27:30,00:27:33,You did get permission from the family to use this body for research?
441,00:27:33,00:27:35,Not necessary. Take a look.
442,00:27:40,00:27:41,(laughs)
443,00:27:41,00:27:43,I'm hosting a luau later.
444,00:27:43,00:27:44,"Well, don't invite Sara."
445,00:27:44,00:27:49,"And before you put on your grass skirt and put pinkie on a spit, I need you in Layout."
446,00:27:49,00:27:52,Nick and Sara need some fresh eyes on the Mason case.
447,00:27:52,00:27:55,"Okay... Come on, come on, come on..."
448,00:27:56,00:27:58,(sighs)
449,00:27:58,00:28:00,DNA has come up empty.
450,00:28:00,00:28:03,There's no sign of either victim on Craig Mason's clothes or shoes.
451,00:28:03,00:28:08,I did notice some scars on his arms. I think he was using the straight razor to cut himself.
452,00:28:08,00:28:15,"STOKES: Hodges analyzed the white trace that was found around the peephole at the Webcam house, and it was a match to Craig's corpse makeup."
453,00:28:16,00:28:18,"So we can put him at the house, but not in the house."
454,00:28:18,00:28:21,And we have nothing so far that puts him at the drug dealer's house.
455,00:28:21,00:28:23,We keep looking.
456,00:28:23,00:28:25,His mother hasn't bailed him out yet.
457,00:28:25,00:28:26,I don't think she's going to.
458,00:28:26,00:28:28,She had that look in her eye that maybe he did it.
459,00:28:29,00:28:31,It is classic escalation.
460,00:28:31,00:28:32,From peeper to murderer.
461,00:28:32,00:28:34,He's a teenager.
462,00:28:34,00:28:38,There were attractive women coming in and out of that house all the time.
463,00:28:38,00:28:42,"It doesn't seem that sinister to me. Besides, he didn't murder the person that he was peeping."
464,00:28:42,00:28:44,STOKES: Maybe he saw Ryan Lester as competition.
465,00:28:44,00:28:46,"You know, Lester was intimate with Marnie."
466,00:28:46,00:28:48,Craig could only watch her from a distance.
467,00:28:48,00:28:51,"All right, say that's true. Then what about the second victim, Cliff Kilo?"
468,00:28:51,00:28:53,WILLOWS: Extensive criminal record.
469,00:28:53,00:28:55,It's mostly drug related.
470,00:28:55,00:28:57,Why would Mason murder a drug dealer?
471,00:28:57,00:28:59,Did he have drugs in his system? No.
472,00:28:59,00:29:01,Tox panel came back clean.
473,00:29:01,00:29:02,And it wasn't about money.
474,00:29:02,00:29:05,"I mean, there was cash all over the house."
475,00:29:05,00:29:07,"All right, if..."
476,00:29:07,00:29:17,"Craig wasn't a ghoul, and if his father hadn't come after Grissom, would you be considering him at all?"
477,00:29:22,00:29:23,And whose hand is this?
478,00:29:24,00:29:27,It's Millander's. Used his own hand to make the mold.
479,00:29:27,00:29:31,"All right, did Paul Millander's thumbs and forefingers have a congenital malformation?"
480,00:29:31,00:29:33,No.
481,00:29:34,00:29:37,Then this isn't his hand.
482,00:29:46,00:29:48,"(latch clicks, door slides)"
483,00:29:52,00:29:54,"Hello, Craig."
484,00:29:54,00:29:55,My name is Ray.
485,00:29:55,00:29:59,I work at the crime lab.
486,00:29:59,00:30:01,Can I see your hands?
487,00:30:02,00:30:04,Please?
488,00:30:08,00:30:10,Hmm.
489,00:30:10,00:30:13,Good. Just a moment.
490,00:30:13,00:30:15,Let me just document them.
491,00:30:15,00:30:16,(camera shutter clicks)
492,00:30:17,00:30:20,I'm gonna need your help with a little experiment.
493,00:30:20,00:30:22,Why would I help the crime lab?
494,00:30:22,00:30:24,Who said you'd be helping the crime lab?
495,00:30:25,00:30:29,You're going to help yourself.
496,00:30:37,00:30:38,(click)
497,00:30:45,00:30:48,"See, Craig, you and I have something in common."
498,00:30:48,00:30:51,We both have fathers who killed people.
499,00:30:51,00:30:52,Your father was a serial killer?
500,00:30:52,00:30:55,No. He was a soldier in the Korean War.
501,00:30:57,00:30:59,He even got a Bronze Star for his work.
502,00:31:00,00:31:02,"That's different. No, it's not."
503,00:31:02,00:31:04,"See, after the war was over, my father continued to fight."
504,00:31:04,00:31:07,"Every once in a while, he would go out to a bar."
505,00:31:07,00:31:10,"Not so much to drink, but to pick fights?"
506,00:31:10,00:31:13,"I remember one day, he came home, he was very excited."
507,00:31:13,00:31:15,Had a black eye and a fat lip.
508,00:31:15,00:31:17,Was bragging about how he had knocked somebody out.
509,00:31:17,00:31:22,"Said he hit the man so hard, the paramedics had to peel him off the floor."
510,00:31:22,00:31:24,Said it was the most fun he'd ever had.
511,00:31:32,00:31:34,(Langston groans)
512,00:31:34,00:31:37,"Why don't you come over here and cut his throat, Craig?"
513,00:31:37,00:31:38,What?
514,00:31:38,00:31:40,"Come on, cut his throat."
515,00:31:40,00:31:42,Don't hold back.
516,00:31:43,00:31:47,Show me how much you'renotlike your father.
517,00:31:57,00:31:58,Hey.
518,00:31:58,00:32:00,Hey. We got a warrant for Craig Mason's medical records.
519,00:32:00,00:32:03,You were right. He was born with a congenital malformation.
520,00:32:03,00:32:07,"He made a mold of his own hand? Like father, like son."
521,00:32:07,00:32:08,"Well, both neck wounds were uniform."
522,00:32:08,00:32:09,"Left to right, slightly downward."
523,00:32:09,00:32:12,Take a look at Jell-O Man.
524,00:32:12,00:32:14,SIDLE: Cut's uneven. Shallow.
525,00:32:14,00:32:16,It's almost vertical. Huh.
526,00:32:16,00:32:18,He could have done that on purpose.
527,00:32:18,00:32:21,"LANGSTON: Well, his anomaly makes it virtually impossible for him to hold a box cutter properly."
528,00:32:21,00:32:22,I watched him.
529,00:32:22,00:32:24,That was the best he could do.
530,00:32:24,00:32:29,"Okay. So, if Craig didn't kill them, who did?"
531,00:32:29,00:32:31,You guys got any evidence outstanding?
532,00:32:34,00:32:36,"ECKLIE: Diane, tell the mayor I'm on my way."
533,00:32:36,00:32:39,"You know, I just had to make a little pit stop at the crime lab."
534,00:32:39,00:32:42,Yeah.
535,00:32:42,00:32:45,"Yeah, all right. Thank you."
536,00:32:45,00:32:47,"What do you need, Ray?"
537,00:32:47,00:32:50,Crooked?
538,00:32:51,00:32:52,What are you doing?
539,00:32:52,00:32:54,Thank you.
540,00:32:54,00:32:56,You know how hard these things are to tie?
541,00:32:59,00:33:01,Got your text. What's up?
542,00:33:01,00:33:04,What do you see?
543,00:33:04,00:33:06,WILLOWS: A guy who likes having his picture taken?
544,00:33:06,00:33:07,He's wearing a bow tie.
545,00:33:07,00:33:09,"Oh, right."
546,00:33:09,00:33:12,"When we found the body, he wasn't wearing a tie."
547,00:33:12,00:33:15,"There's no bow tie on the body, not anywhere on the body."
548,00:33:15,00:33:18,Not even in the pockets.
549,00:33:18,00:33:22,A man who wears a tuxedo every day doesn't forget his bow tie.
550,00:33:22,00:33:23,So what?
551,00:33:23,00:33:24,Someone took it?
552,00:33:24,00:33:26,His bow tie's missing.
553,00:33:26,00:33:28,His intestines are tied into a bow.
554,00:33:28,00:33:30,That can't be a coincidence.
555,00:33:30,00:33:33,I think Dr. Jekyll took it as a souvenir.
556,00:33:33,00:33:35,A souvenir?
557,00:33:35,00:33:37,That's what serial killers do.
558,00:33:37,00:33:38,Joe Joe died of natural causes.
559,00:33:38,00:33:42,I have a bad feeling that this is not the last time we're going to see Dr. Jekyll.
560,00:33:42,00:33:46,"And I think next time, he's not gonna be content starting with a dead body."
561,00:34:53,00:34:59,"If Marnie embraced Harvey, then the blood on his shirt would be secondary transfer."
562,00:34:59,00:35:08,"But on Harvey's shirt, there's an additional blood pattern here, across the shoulder, but not on Marnie's."
563,00:35:08,00:35:09,Which means it can't be secondary transfer.
564,00:35:09,00:35:14,"Shoulder area, large, discreet drops in a single line."
565,00:35:14,00:35:16,Thatis arterial spurt.
566,00:35:16,00:35:17,(yelling)
567,00:35:17,00:35:19,(groaning)
568,00:35:29,00:35:31,"(sirens wailing, indistinct radio transmission)"
569,00:35:32,00:35:34,Las Vegas Police!
570,00:35:37,00:35:39,"Mr. Wincroft, I need you to step outside."
571,00:35:39,00:35:41,We have a warrant to search your house.
572,00:35:41,00:35:42,Captain Brass.
573,00:35:42,00:35:46,Here to make sure the neighborhood's safe?
574,00:35:46,00:35:48,OFFICER: Gun!
575,00:35:48,00:35:50,"BRASS: Okay, okay."
576,00:35:50,00:35:52,"Harvey, put the gun on the ground."
577,00:35:52,00:35:55,"You know how many times I've called you guys, calling for help?"
578,00:35:56,00:36:00,How many times you told me you couldn't do anything until a crime was committed?
579,00:36:00,00:36:02,"Look, next time, you ask for me."
580,00:36:02,00:36:04,You tell them you want to speak to Jim Brass.
581,00:36:04,00:36:14,"So this Ryan, he buys the Greenes' house for five bucks, then he starts selling Webcam sex out of it."
582,00:36:14,00:36:15,My daughter's seven.
583,00:36:15,00:36:17,To see that on her way to school?
584,00:36:17,00:36:20,Obey the sign.
585,00:36:24,00:36:25,(door closes)
586,00:36:25,00:36:29,"Okay, call it in-- man with a gun, potential hostage situation."
587,00:36:29,00:36:31,Check around the back.
588,00:36:31,00:36:32,I need you to stay clear.
589,00:36:32,00:36:34,"Jim, we gotta get that family out of there."
590,00:36:34,00:36:35,(door opening)
591,00:36:35,00:36:38,"Hey, I want to ask you something."
592,00:36:38,00:36:40,Come here.
593,00:36:40,00:36:42,You know how much money you owe on your house?
594,00:36:42,00:36:44,What?
595,00:36:44,00:36:46,You said you could go scuba diving in your house.
596,00:36:46,00:36:48,"STOKES: Yeah, yeah, uh..."
597,00:36:48,00:36:51,I don't know. About 300 grand.
598,00:36:51,00:36:53,"Why don't you talk to me, Harvey?"
599,00:36:53,00:36:54,Why don't you take a step back?
600,00:36:54,00:36:55,We're having a conversation.
601,00:36:55,00:36:57,All right. Okay.
602,00:37:00,00:37:04,"Okay, Harvey, I-I'll talk to you, man."
603,00:37:04,00:37:07,What is it?
604,00:37:07,00:37:10,"You know, I own this house outright."
605,00:37:11,00:37:13,25 years of lifting heavy boxes for World-Send.
606,00:37:13,00:37:16,I put every cent I made into this house.
607,00:37:16,00:37:21,"You know, I don't have a retirement fund or a life savings."
608,00:37:21,00:37:24,(sirens approaching) This house...
609,00:37:24,00:37:25,...is all we have.
610,00:37:25,00:37:28,"Where I come from, that's the American Dream."
611,00:37:28,00:37:31,"Well, my American Dream became kind of a prison, didn't it?"
612,00:37:31,00:37:34,"Hey, wait a minute now, Harvey."
613,00:37:34,00:37:38,"We're... we're talking here, remember?"
614,00:37:39,00:37:42,Answer me this: Why did you buy this house in the first place?
615,00:37:47,00:37:49,For my family.
616,00:37:49,00:37:52,Then why are you putting your family in danger?
617,00:37:56,00:37:58,"Please, put the gun down. I told you to stay back!"
618,00:37:58,00:37:59,"Come on, Harvey."
619,00:37:59,00:38:01,"If you love them, let them go."
620,00:38:06,00:38:09,"Sweetheart, Daddy needs you to go with the nice man, okay?"
621,00:38:09,00:38:10,"Daddy, please, no."
622,00:38:10,00:38:11,"Just go, okay. No..."
623,00:38:11,00:38:13,"STOKES: It's okay, honey."
624,00:38:13,00:38:15,"I got you. I got you, come on. No, Daddy, please."
625,00:38:15,00:38:16,Go! No.
626,00:38:16,00:38:18,I said go! Come on.
627,00:38:19,00:38:21,"I got you, baby. It's okay."
628,00:38:21,00:38:22,"I got you, baby."
629,00:38:22,00:38:23,"I'll take care of her, Harvey."
630,00:38:24,00:38:29,"Why don't you put the gun down and let her mom go, too?"
631,00:38:29,00:38:30,"Come on, Harvey!"
632,00:38:32,00:38:35,Cherry.
633,00:38:37,00:38:40,"(cocks gun) BRASS: No, Harvey..."
634,00:38:40,00:38:42,Don't-don't-don't do it. Don't.
635,00:38:42,00:38:43,"Don't do it, Harvey."
636,00:38:45,00:38:47,Don't do it.
637,00:39:00,00:39:03,I just wanted to protect my family.
638,00:39:17,00:39:20,(handcuffs clicking)
639,00:39:36,00:39:38,"Soon as you're processed out, you're free to go."
640,00:39:44,00:39:45,Craig...
641,00:39:45,00:39:56,"if we made you feel like you were paying for your father's crimes, I'm sorry."
642,00:40:00,00:40:05,"You know, I never even met Mr. Millander."
643,00:40:05,00:40:11,"Yet, I'm more like a Millander than a Mason."
644,00:40:11,00:40:13,You probably wonder how that happened.
645,00:40:13,00:40:15,It has crossed my mind.
646,00:40:15,00:40:23,"You see, my father, Doug Mason, took me to the Halloweird warehouse once a month."
647,00:40:23,00:40:30,"He told me that the owner, Mr. Millander, was his friend."
648,00:40:30,00:40:38,"And in there, my father played with me just like any father would play with his son."
649,00:40:38,00:40:41,Millander's costumes were toys to me.
650,00:40:41,00:40:48,"And I told my father, every time we went, to tell this Mr. Millander that he was a genius."
651,00:40:52,00:40:54,"And then, one day, it all stopped."
652,00:40:54,00:40:57,I lost both my father...
653,00:40:59,00:41:04,...and my idol.
654,00:41:04,00:41:10,Making masks and rubber hands is my way of keeping the connection alive.
655,00:41:12,00:41:16,Is my mom here to pick me up?
656,00:41:17,00:41:19,I can give you a lift.
657,00:41:24,00:41:27,Let's go.
658,00:41:58,00:42:00,"LANGSTON: See, Craig, you and I have something in common."
659,00:42:00,00:42:03,We both have fathers who killed people.
660,00:42:03,00:42:04,CRAIG: Your father was a serial killer?
661,00:42:05,00:42:07,"No, he was a soldier in the Korean War."
662,00:42:07,00:42:10,He even got a Bronze Star for his work.
663,00:42:10,00:42:11,That's different.
664,00:42:11,00:42:12,"No, it's not."
665,00:42:12,00:42:14,"See, after the war was over, my father continued to fight."
666,00:42:14,00:42:17,"Every once in a while, he would go out to a bar."
667,00:42:17,00:42:20,Not so much to drink but to pick fights.
668,00:42:20,00:42:23,"I remember one day he came home, he was very excited."
669,00:42:23,00:42:25,Had a black eye and a fat lip.
670,00:42:25,00:42:28,He was bragging about how he had knocked somebody out.
671,00:42:28,00:42:32,He said he hit the man so hard the paramedics had to peel him off the floor.
672,00:42:33,00:42:36,Said it was the most fun he'd ever had.
673,00:42:43,00:42:45,"Why don't you come over here and cut his throat, Craig?"
674,00:42:45,00:42:46,CRAIG: What?
675,00:42:46,00:42:48,"Come on, cut his throat."
676,00:42:50,00:42:54,Show me how much you'renotlike your father.
