0	00:00:28	00:00:30	Ah, these green worms ain't worth a damn.
1	00:00:37	00:00:38	What the hell was that?
2	00:00:38	00:00:41	I don't know, probably one of those eight-foot carp.
3	00:00:47	00:00:48	Let's get out of here.
4	00:00:57	00:00:59	Something probably caught on the blades.
5	00:00:59	00:01:00	Check the prop.
6	00:01:00	00:01:03	I'm not sticking my hand in that water.
7	00:01:03	00:01:04	Move.
8	00:01:04	00:01:05	Move out of the way.
9	00:01:05	00:01:06	Okay.
10	00:01:14	00:01:16	Yeah, I got something.
11	00:01:18	00:01:21	Dude, throw it back.
12	00:01:21	00:01:22	What the hell is it?
13	00:01:32	00:01:34	Femur.
14	00:01:34	00:01:37	Strongest bone in the human body-- it's sliced clean through.
15	00:01:38	00:01:40	Like a Ginsu through a banana.
16	00:01:40	00:01:41	So, what do you think, drowning?
17	00:01:41	00:01:44	Yeah, probably, but under what circumstances?
18	00:01:44	00:01:46	You don't wear flippers at a five-star restaurant.
19	00:01:46	00:01:49	Why would you wear three-inch heels at a lake?
20	00:01:50	00:01:51	So, Watson?
21	00:01:53	00:01:54	The game is afoot.
22	00:02:31	00:02:33	What do you think, bro?
23	00:02:33	00:02:34	Breakfast on me?
24	00:02:34	00:02:36	I got a court date...
25	00:02:36	00:02:37	straight off of graveyard.
26	00:02:37	00:02:38	It sucks.
27	00:02:38	00:02:39	Ouch.
28	00:02:39	00:02:41	Well, time-and-a-half.
29	00:02:41	00:02:42	A cup of java, and you're set.
30	00:02:42	00:02:44	Fine suit.
31	00:02:44	00:02:47	And well, just fine.
32	00:02:47	00:02:49	That's harassment.
33	00:02:49	00:02:52	Hey, we have one locker room and it's my job to be observant.
34	00:02:52	00:02:55	Well, evidence vault opens in five.
35	00:02:55	00:02:56	See you guys later.
36	00:02:56	00:02:57	Later, bro. Easy.
37	00:02:57	00:03:00	So, you and me, 419 Western Avenue.
38	00:03:00	00:03:03	I know, a dead body at a fraternity.
39	00:03:03	00:03:06	00 A.M.-- Looks like we're pulling another double.
40	00:03:06	00:03:08	I know, we don't have all day...
41	00:03:08	00:03:10	Are, are you going to wear... that?
42	00:03:11	00:03:13	Yeah.
43	00:03:14	00:03:16	It's that hideous...
44	00:03:16	00:03:17	Hideous.
45	00:03:17	00:03:18	Thank you.
46	00:03:24	00:03:27	Large propeller.
47	00:03:27	00:03:28	Blade cut clean through.
48	00:03:28	00:03:32	No epidermal bruising.
49	00:03:32	00:03:33	The leg was severed post-mortem.
50	00:03:34	00:03:36	Well, that's good news.
51	00:03:36	00:03:37	How do you figure?
52	00:03:37	00:03:39	Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off?
53	00:03:41	00:03:43	I believe this goes with that.
54	00:03:43	00:03:49	Divers recovered the body about a half a mile east of Calville Marina.
55	00:03:49	00:03:51	Female Caucasian, mid-30s.
56	00:03:51	00:03:53	Left thighbone connected to nothing.
57	00:03:53	00:03:54	I believe this is our victim.
58	00:03:55	00:03:57	Well, she's wearing a wedding ring.
59	00:03:57	00:03:58	Will you collect a rape kit?
60	00:03:58	00:03:59	Always do.
61	00:03:59	00:04:00	How's it look for prints?
62	00:04:00	00:04:02	Her skin's shriveled like a Shar-Pei.
63	00:04:02	00:04:03	No pressure, no prints.
64	00:04:06	00:04:07	No.
65	00:04:07	00:04:08	No way, use your own hand.
66	00:04:09	00:04:10	Come on, Catherine, my hand's too big.
67	00:04:10	00:04:11	No!
68	00:04:11	00:04:13	It's the only way we can print her.
69	00:04:13	00:04:16	Her skin on your hand should fit like a leather glove.
70	00:04:24	00:04:26	Uh...
71	00:04:27	00:04:28	May I take your hand?
72	00:04:39	00:04:43	On behalf of the decedent I thank you.
73	00:04:48	00:04:50	Umm...
74	00:04:50	00:04:52	I think we're going to know who she is by lunchtime.
75	00:04:53	00:04:54	Ugh!
76	00:05:01	00:05:03	I can't believe I used to live in a place like this.
77	00:05:03	00:05:05	It seems like a hundred years ago.
78	00:05:05	00:05:07	And here I had all this respect for you.
79	00:05:07	00:05:09	Guys, Nick Stokes.
80	00:05:09	00:05:11	This is Sara Sidel. We're with the crime lab.
81	00:05:11	00:05:12	How you doing?
82	00:05:12	00:05:13	I'm Matt Daniels.
83	00:05:13	00:05:16	James is upstairs if you guys want to follow me.
84	00:05:16	00:05:17	Okay.
85	00:05:25	00:05:26	Hey.
86	00:05:26	00:05:27	Hey.
87	00:05:29	00:05:31	Good God!
88	00:05:31	00:05:32	You see a suicide note?
89	00:05:32	00:05:34	We didn't find one.
90	00:05:34	00:05:36	Don't release anyone downstairs.
91	00:05:36	00:05:38	We want to talk to them.
92	00:05:38	00:05:39	All of them.
93	00:05:39	00:05:40	Coroner pronounce?
94	00:05:40	00:05:41	Twenty minutes ago.
95	00:05:43	00:05:44	Just get him down.
96	00:05:45	00:05:50	She's a floater, Wendy Barger. 34, local, Green Valley.
97	00:05:50	00:05:52	We should contact her family.
98	00:05:52	00:05:53	Already did.
99	00:05:53	00:05:54	Talked to the husband.
100	00:05:54	00:05:55	Never reported her missing.
101	00:05:55	00:05:58	The coroner said she'd been in the water for two days.
102	00:05:58	00:05:59	Where's the husband now?
103	00:05:59	00:06:02	At the coroner's, IDing the body.
104	00:06:05	00:06:07	Hey.
105	00:06:07	00:06:08	Results are back on the rape kit.
106	00:06:08	00:06:11	Positive for semen, vaginal penetration.
107	00:06:11	00:06:13	You confirming rape?
108	00:06:13	00:06:14	Well, there are signs of a struggle.
109	00:06:14	00:06:16	The victim's right shoulder is dislocated.
110	00:06:16	00:06:18	Her skull is fractured.
111	00:06:19	00:06:21	Give me a little more time with the body.
112	00:06:21	00:06:22	Sure.
113	00:06:22	00:06:23	Thanks, Jenna.
114	00:06:29	00:06:32	Mr. Barger, my name is Gil Grissom.
115	00:06:32	00:06:33	Hello.
116	00:06:33	00:06:34	This is Catherine Willows.
117	00:06:34	00:06:36	We're forensic investigators.
118	00:06:36	00:06:37	Sit down.
119	00:06:40	00:06:42	We need to ask you a few questions.
120	00:06:42	00:06:43	All right.
121	00:06:43	00:06:47	Is there anyone that you know of that might have wanted to harm your wife?
122	00:06:47	00:06:48	No.
123	00:06:48	00:06:49	Everybody loved Wendy.
124	00:06:49	00:06:50	When was the last time you saw her?
125	00:06:50	00:06:51	Tuesday morning.
126	00:06:51	00:06:54	She needed some time away...
127	00:06:54	00:06:56	to get perspective.
128	00:06:56	00:06:58	She did that sometimes.
129	00:06:58	00:07:03	Uh, we have a, a cabin up by Calville Bay.
130	00:07:03	00:07:08	And when was the last time you had intercourse with your wife?
131	00:07:08	00:07:09	Oh, that-that's personal.
132	00:07:09	00:07:11	It's part of our investigation, sir.
133	00:07:11	00:07:15	Uh, well, the average is only once a week.
134	00:07:15	00:07:16	Saturdays.
135	00:07:20	00:07:22	Mr. Barger...
136	00:07:22	00:07:23	Probably three or four months ago.
137	00:07:23	00:07:27	Would you be willing to give us a DNA sample, sir?
138	00:07:28	00:07:30	What's going on?
139	00:07:30	00:07:32	I thought Wendy drowned.
140	00:07:32	00:07:34	We're still trying to piece it all together.
141	00:07:34	00:07:35	A sample would be helpful.
142	00:07:36	00:07:39	By law, we need a warrant unless you are willing to volunteer it.
143	00:07:41	00:07:43	Was James depressed?
144	00:07:43	00:07:44	You could say that.
145	00:07:44	00:07:45	Could you say that?
146	00:07:45	00:07:49	I mean, the kid's 18 years old he's got his whole life life in front of him and why would he want to hang himself?
147	00:07:49	00:07:50	I don't know.
148	00:07:50	00:07:51	He didn't get in?
149	00:07:51	00:07:53	Get in...?
150	00:07:53	00:07:54	The fraternity.
151	00:07:55	00:07:57	Pledging. I mean, it's not easy.
152	00:07:57	00:07:58	Apparently not.
153	00:07:58	00:08:01	So, you guys let James know he wasn't getting in, right?
154	00:08:01	00:08:02	I told him last night.
155	00:08:02	00:08:03	I'm the one in charge of dinging pledges.
156	00:08:03	00:08:04	Big job?
157	00:08:05	00:08:06	How'd he take it?
158	00:08:06	00:08:08	I think you know.
159	00:08:16	00:08:17	Hey, Judge.
160	00:08:17	00:08:18	What's going on?
161	00:08:18	00:08:20	I'm due in your court.
162	00:08:20	00:08:21	Called for a continuance.
163	00:08:21	00:08:23	Well, nobody told me.
164	00:08:23	00:08:25	Nobody was supposed to tell you.
165	00:08:30	00:08:31	You're going to do something for me.
166	00:08:31	00:08:34	Judge, I thought we were even.
167	00:08:34	00:08:36	How much longer am I under your thumb?
168	00:08:36	00:08:40	You do what I ask, slate's clean.
169	00:08:41	00:08:43	Henderson rape case.
170	00:08:43	00:08:44	State's evidence.
171	00:08:44	00:08:46	Damn.
172	00:08:46	00:08:47	I knew you were in tight.
173	00:08:48	00:08:50	Judges aren't appointed on a whim.
174	00:08:50	00:08:53	I owed the family.
175	00:08:53	00:08:55	I need you to compromise the chain of custody.
176	00:08:55	00:08:56	Just like that?
177	00:08:58	00:09:02	We got a slam dunk on a three-time rapist and he's just going to walk?
178	00:09:04	00:09:06	I have to have this case kicked.
179	00:09:06	00:09:08	I'm already on probation.
180	00:09:08	00:09:10	Give them an excuse.
181	00:09:10	00:09:11	You're good at that.
182	00:09:11	00:09:13	You worked the graveyard.
183	00:09:13	00:09:14	You pulled a double and you're tired.
184	00:09:15	00:09:17	It could happen to anybody.
185	00:09:17	00:09:20	Don't worry. I've got your back.
186	00:09:20	00:09:23	Yeah, I feel you back there, believe me.
187	00:09:29	00:09:31	Hey, Maestro, what's the deal on our floater?
188	00:09:33	00:09:34	Excuse me.
189	00:09:34	00:09:36	Professor.
190	00:09:36	00:09:37	What's up with our floater?
191	00:09:37	00:09:38	Come hither.
192	00:09:42	00:09:44	DNA doesn't match.
193	00:09:44	00:09:47	Thirteen markers, and not one of them matches the husband's types.
194	00:09:47	00:09:48	It's funny.
195	00:09:48	00:09:50	I like the husband for this.
196	00:09:50	00:09:51	Well, you were wrong.
197	00:09:51	00:09:53	My client's been through enough distress.
198	00:09:53	00:09:56	Winston, come on.
199	00:10:01	00:10:06	When you find out what happened to my wife I want to know everything.
200	00:10:06	00:10:08	I promise.
201	00:10:17	00:10:18	Let me ask you something.
202	00:10:18	00:10:19	Would you want to know everything?
203	00:10:19	00:10:21	You're asking the wrong guy.
204	00:10:21	00:10:24	Barger as much as told us that he and his wife are having problems.
205	00:10:24	00:10:25	She was staying at the lake.
206	00:10:25	00:10:26	It wasn't the first time.
207	00:10:26	00:10:29	And what do you think the chances are she was seeing somebody else?
208	00:10:29	00:10:31	You were married. You tell me.
209	00:10:31	00:10:32	Very good to excellent.
210	00:10:42	00:10:45	I need to see the Henderson rape case 4217.
211	00:10:45	00:10:48	Sure, in here.
212	00:10:57	00:10:59	Uh, sign here.
213	00:10:59	00:11:01	Thanks, Mike.
214	00:11:14	00:11:15	Hey.
215	00:11:15	00:11:16	How's court?
216	00:11:16	00:11:19	Uh, damn case was continued.
217	00:11:19	00:11:20	Clerk never called.
218	00:11:20	00:11:22	Look, go home. Take a day.
219	00:11:22	00:11:23	You're been working your ass off.
220	00:11:24	00:11:26	Nature of the beast.
221	00:11:26	00:11:27	I'm grateful, Warrick.
222	00:11:27	00:11:29	I'm glad you're back.
223	00:11:29	00:11:30	And I owe you a party.
224	00:11:30	00:11:32	Party?
225	00:11:32	00:11:33	Yeah, I made you a CSI Three.
226	00:11:34	00:11:36	You'll see it in your next paycheck.
227	00:11:36	00:11:37	More money, more problems.
228	00:11:37	00:11:39	Mm...
229	00:11:39	00:11:40	Thanks.
230	00:11:40	00:11:41	Yeah.
231	00:11:41	00:11:42	I appreciate it.
232	00:11:45	00:11:50	If Wendy Barger was sleeping around none of her friends knew about it.
233	00:11:50	00:11:52	Anybody seen her since Tuesday?
234	00:11:52	00:11:54	Nope.
235	00:11:54	00:11:56	And as far as I can tell, the husband's on the level.
236	00:11:56	00:11:58	He was happier in the marriage than she was.
237	00:11:59	00:12:00	She had something on the side.
238	00:12:01	00:12:05	I can tell you firsthand when you don't cheat, you don't suspect.
239	00:12:05	00:12:06	Oh, man.
240	00:12:07	00:12:09	I wish I had been married to you.
241	00:12:09	00:12:10	Not a chance.
242	00:12:10	00:12:14	Oh... mm...
243	00:12:14	00:12:16	Coroner just called. They're waiting for us.
244	00:12:16	00:12:17	Okay.
245	00:12:18	00:12:19	Brass, you coming?
246	00:12:19	00:12:21	I still got half a burger.
247	00:12:21	00:12:23	Besides, I prefer live bodies.
248	00:12:23	00:12:26	Hey, Grissom.
249	00:12:26	00:12:27	You got a second?
250	00:12:27	00:12:29	Uh, I'm in purgatory.
251	00:12:29	00:12:30	Need some guidance.
252	00:12:30	00:12:33	Meet you at the car. Meet you at the car.
253	00:12:37	00:12:38	Okay, here's your frat boy.
254	00:12:38	00:12:42	We have a petechial hemorrhaging which is synonymous with asphyxia.
255	00:12:42	00:12:44	So he was asphyxiated by hanging?
256	00:12:44	00:12:46	Are you ruling suicide? No, not yet.
257	00:12:47	00:12:51	When a victim is found hung we usually find some teeth marks on the tongue.
258	00:12:54	00:12:55	No teeth marks.
259	00:12:55	00:12:57	But we found him swinging from the ceiling.
260	00:12:57	00:13:00	So, the question is, how did he get there?
261	00:13:00	00:13:02	Speaking of how did it get there...
262	00:13:05	00:13:08	How did this get on his penis? Huh.
263	00:13:09	00:13:10	Is that a tattoo?
264	00:13:10	00:13:12	No, no, it looks like ink.
265	00:13:14	00:13:15	Nick?
266	00:13:15	00:13:16	You want to take a look?
267	00:13:16	00:13:17	Oh, no, I...
268	00:13:17	00:13:19	don't have to look.
269	00:13:19	00:13:21	I have a good idea what this is about.
270	00:13:21	00:13:22	Okay.
271	00:13:22	00:13:23	Knock yourself out.
272	00:13:25	00:13:27	Does your fraternity practice hazing?
273	00:13:27	00:13:29	No.
274	00:13:30	00:13:35	Yeah, I mean, it took a long time for Phi Alpha to get its charter.
275	00:13:35	00:13:39	We have a strict no-tolerance policy and as president, I enforce that to the letter.
276	00:13:40	00:13:44	Come on, man, I was a Greek and we had all kinds of policies, too.
277	00:13:44	00:13:47	Guys still hazed.
278	00:13:47	00:13:48	We found ink on James' penis.
279	00:13:48	00:13:53	Are you trying to tell us he was just practicing his penmanship?
280	00:13:53	00:13:56	State passed a law-- no hazing.
281	00:13:56	00:13:59	It's six months in jail plus expulsion.
282	00:13:59	00:14:00	We do not haze.
283	00:14:00	00:14:02	But there is an initiation.
284	00:14:05	00:14:09	Pledges, turn and face your active chapter.
285	00:14:15	00:14:18	For the past ten weeks you guys have accumulated points.
286	00:14:18	00:14:22	Some of you are way ahead.
287	00:14:22	00:14:24	Some of you are way...
288	00:14:24	00:14:25	behind.
289	00:14:27	00:14:30	It's time to get signed!
290	00:14:32	00:14:36	I could tell right off the bat James was nervous, you know?
291	00:14:36	00:14:38	He was kind of this shy guy.
292	00:14:38	00:14:39	I mean, he...
293	00:14:39	00:14:40	He wanted to pledge.
294	00:14:40	00:14:42	He wanted to belong.
295	00:14:42	00:14:44	Yeah, he wanted to belong but you know what, I questioned his chops.
296	00:14:44	00:14:46	I think we all did.
297	00:14:46	00:14:51	So, yeah, we gave the pledges an assignment.
298	00:14:51	00:14:53	They were to go to sorority row and, uh, get...
299	00:14:53	00:14:56	different parts of their bodies signed.
300	00:14:56	00:14:58	I mean, the menu was pretty straightforward.
301	00:14:58	00:15:07	five points ten points for your chest, 25 points for your butt cheeks and 100 points for your Johnson.
302	00:15:07	00:15:08	Your Johnson?
303	00:15:08	00:15:09	Yeah, your, uh...
304	00:15:09	00:15:10	I know what it is.
305	00:15:13	00:15:16	Don't stop now.
306	00:15:16	00:15:18	And Johnson...
307	00:15:20	00:15:25	...your sorry ass is so far behind in points that you better get your...
308	00:15:25	00:15:27	Johnson...
309	00:15:27	00:15:31	signed a couple hundred times or you're... history.
310	00:15:35	00:15:37	Kyle caught him cheating in the bathroom.
311	00:15:38	00:15:40	He was signing himself.
312	00:15:40	00:15:42	Oh, man! No!
313	00:15:46	00:15:47	What a fake!
314	00:15:51	00:15:54	You humiliate him in front of all the other actives.
315	00:15:54	00:15:58	Poor kid was so scared he had to sign himself.
316	00:15:58	00:16:00	You give him a beer shower?
317	00:16:00	00:16:03	And you don't call that hazing?
318	00:16:07	00:16:09	Answer the question, guys.
319	00:16:14	00:16:15	I had no choice.
320	00:16:15	00:16:16	I had to ding him.
321	00:16:16	00:16:20	I mean, come on, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
322	00:16:22	00:16:24	We didn't pledge him. He pledged us.
323	00:16:24	00:16:27	He knew what to expect if he didn't measure up.
324	00:16:27	00:16:32	Humiliation, initiation...
325	00:16:32	00:16:33	appreciation.
326	00:16:33	00:16:36	That's what it's all about, right, right?
327	00:16:36	00:16:38	We're sorry, but we didn't kill him.
328	00:16:41	00:16:44	I don't buy it.
329	00:16:44	00:16:47	Judge... Warrick.
330	00:16:47	00:16:51	Listen, uh, I got a little problem.
331	00:16:51	00:16:53	No, I can't talk about it over the phone.
332	00:16:53	00:16:55	We got to meet in person.
333	00:16:55	00:17:00	There's something in the evidence I think you should see.
334	00:17:00	00:17:03	Good.
335	00:17:09	00:17:10	I'll start at the top.
336	00:17:10	00:17:12	Head contusion, right temple.
337	00:17:12	00:17:15	Imbedded with wood splinters, lime green paint.
338	00:17:15	00:17:17	What does that give us?
339	00:17:17	00:17:21	Nothing yet, but when you find the murder weapon it might give you something to compare it against.
340	00:17:21	00:17:23	Moving down, three words.
341	00:17:23	00:17:24	Write them down.
342	00:17:25	00:17:27	Minimal pulmonary aspiration.
343	00:17:27	00:17:29	There was no water in her lungs?
344	00:17:29	00:17:32	If she died by drowning, her lungs would be flooded.
345	00:17:35	00:17:37	But her lungs weren't flooded.
346	00:17:37	00:17:40	So we think she was raped killed, then dumped in the lake.
347	00:17:40	00:17:41	After a very nice dinner.
348	00:17:44	00:17:45	Which brings me to her stomach.
349	00:17:46	00:17:52	Fried calamari and based on the extent of the digestion she died about three hours after she ate.
350	00:18:00	00:18:02	Now tell me, why are we here?
351	00:18:02	00:18:08	'Cause it's the only place within ten miles of Calville Bay that serves calamari.
352	00:18:08	00:18:10	And you know this because...?
353	00:18:10	00:18:11	I come here for calamari.
354	00:18:11	00:18:13	Oh. Alone?
355	00:18:13	00:18:17	No. Sometimes I have a beer with it.
356	00:18:17	00:18:19	Do you recognize this woman?
357	00:18:19	00:18:22	She might have eaten here Tuesday night right around this time.
358	00:18:22	00:18:24	Ordered the calamari.
359	00:18:24	00:18:25	Miss, everyone orders calamari.
360	00:18:25	00:18:28	Well, I don't care about everyone.
361	00:18:28	00:18:29	I care about her.
362	00:18:29	00:18:31	Uh... yeah.
363	00:18:31	00:18:32	Yeah, I remember her.
364	00:18:32	00:18:33	Um, she came in with a guy.
365	00:18:34	00:18:35	Regulars.
366	00:18:35	00:18:36	Good tipper.
367	00:18:36	00:18:39	Would you happen to know this good tipper's name?
368	00:18:39	00:18:42	Mr. Swelco, are you all right?
369	00:18:44	00:18:47	I can't believe she's dead.
370	00:18:47	00:18:52	Could you tell us about your affair with Wendy?
371	00:18:52	00:18:54	Nobody knew we had one.
372	00:18:54	00:18:55	What about your wife?
373	00:18:55	00:18:57	We were separated.
374	00:18:57	00:19:00	We filed for divorce last week.
375	00:19:01	00:19:04	I thought Wendy was going to do the same thing.
376	00:19:04	00:19:07	And... when she didn't, you got angry?
377	00:19:07	00:19:09	No. No.
378	00:19:09	00:19:12	That's not what I meant.
379	00:19:12	00:19:14	I loved Wendy.
380	00:19:14	00:19:17	She said the marriage was over.
381	00:19:17	00:19:20	It's just that... just... she was scared.
382	00:19:20	00:19:22	Scared?
383	00:19:22	00:19:25	Why?
384	00:19:25	00:19:26	She didn't want to hurt Winston.
385	00:19:26	00:19:29	She thought if she left, he'd...
386	00:19:30	00:19:31	break.
387	00:19:33	00:19:38	Tuesday night you and Wendy had dinner at the Grille?
388	00:19:38	00:19:41	Where'd you go after that?
389	00:19:41	00:19:47	We went back to the marina in her car and then we took the outboard back here.
390	00:19:47	00:19:49	Why'd you take the boat?
391	00:19:49	00:19:58	Wendy didn't want anybody to s-see her car in my driveway so we always met at the marina and then we'd take the outboard over here.
392	00:19:59	00:20:01	What happened once you got here?
393	00:20:01	00:20:03	We made love.
394	00:20:05	00:20:08	Then she left.
395	00:20:08	00:20:10	Took the boat back.
396	00:20:15	00:20:18	Where is... the boat?
397	00:20:18	00:20:20	At the marina.
398	00:20:26	00:20:28	Do you believe him?
399	00:20:28	00:20:32	I believe he had an affair.
400	00:20:39	00:20:43	That the husband?
401	00:20:43	00:20:45	Mr. Barger, what are you doing here?
402	00:20:46	00:20:49	You didn't call, so I was following you.
403	00:20:49	00:20:50	Uh, this is...
404	00:20:50	00:20:51	Phil Swelco's house, isn't it?
405	00:20:51	00:20:53	Do you know Mr. Swelco?
406	00:20:53	00:20:54	Informally.
407	00:20:54	00:20:57	Does he have something to do with Wendy's death?
408	00:20:57	00:20:59	We're interviewing a lot of people.
409	00:20:59	00:21:00	Most of it's follow-up.
410	00:21:00	00:21:05	Mr. Barger, this is a time when you ought to let us do our job.
411	00:21:05	00:21:06	You've been through a terrible ordeal.
412	00:21:06	00:21:10	You've asked us to keep you posted and I promise we will keep you posted.
413	00:21:10	00:21:12	I just wanted to see if you guys have anything new.
414	00:21:12	00:21:14	As soon as we know, you'll know.
415	00:21:14	00:21:17	All right.
416	00:21:19	00:21:21	Drive safely.
417	00:21:23	00:21:30	You know, eventually we're going to have to tell this guy that his wife was having an affair with somebody he knows.
418	00:21:30	00:21:31	No, we don't, Catherine.
419	00:21:31	00:21:34	We have to tell him how his wife died.
420	00:21:34	00:21:36	Just the facts, without all the other stuff.
421	00:21:36	00:21:41	When Eddie was cheating on me I sure wish somebody would have said something.
422	00:21:41	00:21:42	You mean me.
423	00:21:43	00:21:44	Who else?
424	00:21:52	00:21:54	New pet?
425	00:21:54	00:21:57	The African red baboon tarantula-- the most feared of all arachnids.
426	00:21:57	00:21:59	But basically harmless.
427	00:21:59	00:22:02	Yeah, well just keep the lid on it, okay?
428	00:22:02	00:22:03	I think you scared him.
429	00:22:03	00:22:04	All his hairs are standing up.
430	00:22:04	00:22:08	If you're through amusing yourself I have some news on the boat.
431	00:22:08	00:22:09	Was it at the marina?
432	00:22:09	00:22:10	What do you think?
433	00:22:10	00:22:13	My spider sense says it wasn't.
434	00:22:13	00:22:14	Right. We need to find the boat.
435	00:22:20	00:22:23	The coroner's prelim on the frat hanging.
436	00:22:23	00:22:24	Bust it out.
437	00:22:25	00:22:26	What's that smell?
438	00:22:26	00:22:28	I'm nuking a burrito.
439	00:22:28	00:22:31	Mmm, junk food and radiation-- good combo.
440	00:22:31	00:22:36	A strip of raw calf's liver was found lodged inside the cleft of victim's throat.
441	00:22:36	00:22:37	choking.
442	00:22:37	00:22:41	Mm-hmm. That's interesting.
443	00:22:41	00:22:46	Microscopic threads of fabric were found embedded in the liver.
444	00:22:46	00:22:48	Microscopic fabric?
445	00:22:48	00:22:51	I have no idea what you're talking about.
446	00:22:51	00:22:53	You just lost me.
447	00:22:53	00:22:56	Kyle, I'm getting that hazing feeling.
448	00:22:56	00:22:57	Did you stuff him?
449	00:22:58	00:22:58	Suffocate him?
450	00:22:59	00:23:00	Shove towels down his throat?
451	00:23:00	00:23:06	No. Look, lady, I have no idea where you're going with all this but you're way off.
452	00:23:07	00:23:08	Tell me about the liver.
453	00:23:11	00:23:13	What about the liver?
454	00:23:13	00:23:15	Kyle...
455	00:23:15	00:23:17	Kyle...
456	00:23:17	00:23:20	11 years ago I was you, man.
457	00:23:20	00:23:23	Smoking cigars in closets, playing tanks.
458	00:23:23	00:23:29	I wore a trout in my jean pocket for seven days till my leg went half numb.
459	00:23:29	00:23:30	I've been there.
460	00:23:30	00:23:32	So, don't...
461	00:23:32	00:23:34	don't tell me What about it?
462	00:23:35	00:23:37	Okay.
463	00:23:37	00:23:42	James begged us for one more shot so, we came up with a challenge.
464	00:23:42	00:23:46	Swallowing raw liver.
465	00:23:53	00:23:55	Oh, man.
466	00:23:55	00:23:56	Oh, man, he's choking.
467	00:23:56	00:23:58	Give him the Heimlich.
468	00:23:58	00:24:00	Give him the Heimlich. Give him the Heimlich!
469	00:24:02	00:24:03	He's turning blue!
470	00:24:03	00:24:07	How does a kid choke to death and end up hanging from a rafter?
471	00:24:19	00:24:21	Okay.
472	00:24:24	00:24:25	We freaked.
473	00:24:25	00:24:28	I mean, we had a lot to lose here.
474	00:24:28	00:24:33	We could lose our charter or get kicked out of school or even go to jail.
475	00:24:35	00:24:38	So, me and Matt, we strung him up, and...
476	00:24:38	00:24:40	made it look like he'd committed suicide.
477	00:24:44	00:24:47	You do realize you just admitted to killing him?
478	00:24:47	00:24:48	We didn't kill him.
479	00:24:48	00:24:49	It was an accident.
480	00:24:50	00:24:53	It was an accident but now it's beginning to look like Christmas.
481	00:24:56	00:25:00	Look, my dad's a top defense attorney so, if charges are filed...
482	00:25:00	00:25:01	Don't worry.
483	00:25:01	00:25:04	They will be.
484	00:25:04	00:25:07	It'll be manslaughter, not murder.
485	00:25:07	00:25:12	And me and Matt wind up with community service.
486	00:25:12	00:25:14	We can hold him for manslaughter.
487	00:25:14	00:25:15	Manslaughter-- are you kidding?
488	00:25:15	00:25:16	Are you willing to settle for that?
489	00:25:16	00:25:19	Come on, Nick, you know as well as I do there is more to this.
490	00:25:19	00:25:21	You're going 80 miles an hour in second gear.
491	00:25:21	00:25:23	Let's just slow down, all right?
492	00:25:23	00:25:24	Okay.
493	00:25:25	00:25:28	They said they performed the Heimlich, right?
494	00:25:28	00:25:30	Yeah. I don't believe them.
495	00:25:30	00:25:35	Well, if they performed the Heimlich there'd be evidence of trauma.
496	00:25:36	00:25:39	Yes, there would.
497	00:25:41	00:25:42	Well, now, you're right.
498	00:25:42	00:25:45	If they gave this frat kid the Heimlich chances are we'd find a broken rib.
499	00:25:45	00:25:46	Not even a fracture.
500	00:25:46	00:25:49	What about abdominal or thoracic bruising?
501	00:25:49	00:25:51	Nope. Photos are all negative.
502	00:25:51	00:25:52	They lied.
503	00:25:52	00:25:55	When this kid was choking, no one tried to help him.
504	00:25:55	00:25:56	Take a look at this.
505	00:26:01	00:26:04	Now, we magnified Mr. Johnson's privates.
506	00:26:04	00:26:06	The ink is from a felt tip.
507	00:26:07	00:26:10	It's a Paper Max Thin Tip to be exact.
508	00:26:11	00:26:12	Jill W.
509	00:26:13	00:26:14	Two triangles.
510	00:26:14	00:26:16	No, it's two deltas.
511	00:26:16	00:26:17	Greek letters.
512	00:26:17	00:26:18	She's a Delt.
513	00:26:20	00:26:21	Freaks.
514	00:26:21	00:26:24	Jill, we need to ask you a question.
515	00:26:24	00:26:26	Is this your signature?
516	00:26:28	00:26:29	Oh, my God.
517	00:26:31	00:26:32	Oh, where did you get that?
518	00:26:32	00:26:34	Where do you think?
519	00:26:34	00:26:37	You don't think that has something to do with what happened?
520	00:26:37	00:26:38	We don't know yet.
521	00:26:38	00:26:40	That's what we're trying to find out.
522	00:26:40	00:26:41	How well did you know James?
523	00:26:41	00:26:44	Uh, he was pledging my boyfriend's house.
524	00:26:44	00:26:45	We're Greek, I mean...
525	00:26:45	00:26:48	We sign them, they sign us.
526	00:26:48	00:26:50	Of course you do.
527	00:26:50	00:26:52	Who's your boyfriend?
528	00:26:52	00:26:55	Kyle Travis.
529	00:27:13	00:27:16	So, looking for fibers.
530	00:27:16	00:27:20	Yeah, fibers liver-- anything to implicate these guys.
531	00:27:47	00:27:49	What the heck is that?
532	00:27:49	00:27:50	The murder weapon.
533	00:27:51	00:27:53	Dingle-dangle.
534	00:27:58	00:27:59	Let me guess.
535	00:27:59	00:28:01	Radiohead or Rage Against the Machine.
536	00:28:02	00:28:07	Actually, it's an audio book on restriction enzyme analysis and DNA typing.
537	00:28:07	00:28:08	PCR fingerprinting.
538	00:28:08	00:28:09	Choice.
539	00:28:09	00:28:10	Right.
540	00:28:10	00:28:12	What's Grissom doing in the garage?
541	00:28:12	00:28:16	Oh, he's working that Wendy Barger case-- you know, the floater?
542	00:28:16	00:28:19	Only clue he's got is a missing boat which sucks, 'cause... it's missing.
543	00:28:19	00:28:22	He thinks he's going to find it in a bathtub?
544	00:28:22	00:28:23	It's a simulation tank.
545	00:28:23	00:28:26	He's re-creating the conditions the night she died.
546	00:28:26	00:28:29	Body was dumped, like, a half mile from Calville Bay.
547	00:28:29	00:28:32	They think the boat must have drifted with the currents.
548	00:28:32	00:28:34	And let me guess-- Catherine got bored.
549	00:28:34	00:28:35	Well, you know Grissom.
550	00:28:35	00:28:38	Shortest distance between two points is science.
551	00:28:38	00:28:41	And for Catherine, it's pounding the pavement.
552	00:28:41	00:28:44	Hey, I thought Grissom gave you the night off.
553	00:28:45	00:28:49	Yeah. Something came up.
554	00:28:49	00:28:51	See you.
555	00:31:06	00:31:07	Yeah? Grissom.
556	00:31:07	00:31:08	It's me.
557	00:31:08	00:31:09	I found it.
558	00:31:09	00:31:11	Just south of Barring Point Bridge.
559	00:31:11	00:31:13	How?
560	00:31:13	00:31:15	I took a walk.
561	00:31:15	00:31:18	Just south of Barring Point Bridge?
562	00:31:18	00:31:19	What color is the boat?
563	00:31:19	00:31:22	It's white with lime green trim.
564	00:31:22	00:31:25	Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound.
565	00:31:25	00:31:27	Well done, Catherine.
566	00:31:27	00:31:29	Well done.
567	00:31:30	00:31:32	Let's get the boat back to the garage.
568	00:31:54	00:31:57	This better be good.
569	00:32:00	00:32:02	I need some assurances.
570	00:32:02	00:32:04	It's a two-way street, pal.
571	00:32:04	00:32:06	Did you do what I asked?
572	00:32:06	00:32:08	I checked out the evidence, yeah.
573	00:32:08	00:32:10	But I'm not sure about the rest.
574	00:32:10	00:32:11	What's the big deal?
575	00:32:11	00:32:14	You break the seal on the evidence box it's over.
576	00:32:14	00:32:18	We put it to bed, and I tell Henderson Mission accomplished.
577	00:32:18	00:32:20	Why don't you let me do that?
578	00:32:25	00:32:27	What's going on here?
579	00:32:27	00:32:34	Judge Cohen, you're under arrest for obstruction of justice tampering with state's evidence and violating seven articles of scumbag.
580	00:32:37	00:32:39	I told you...
581	00:32:39	00:32:41	nobody owns me.
582	00:32:42	00:32:44	Move on.
583	00:32:45	00:32:48	Nice work, man.
584	00:32:53	00:32:55	Hey, Grissom.
585	00:32:55	00:32:57	I hear Catherine beat you to the boat.
586	00:32:57	00:32:58	We work as a team.
587	00:32:58	00:32:59	We're not competing.
588	00:33:00	00:33:00	Okay.
589	00:33:01	00:33:04	But, uh, she found it first right?
590	00:33:04	00:33:09	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, sorry I could not travel both.
591	00:33:09	00:33:10	Robert Frost.
592	00:33:10	00:33:11	Very good, Greg.
593	00:33:11	00:33:13	Thanks.
594	00:33:13	00:33:16	But actually, in this case, Mr. Frost does not apply.
595	00:33:16	00:33:20	When you have partner you each take a road.
596	00:33:20	00:33:22	That's how you find a missing boat.
597	00:33:22	00:33:23	Come on. Level with me.
598	00:33:23	00:33:26	Who do you think killed her-- the husband or boyfriend?
599	00:33:28	00:33:30	And you've narrowed it down to just two suspects?
600	00:33:30	00:33:31	Actually, you did.
601	00:33:31	00:33:41	You see, my second week at CSI, you told me that when a cheating spouse is murdered the lover and the betrayed.
602	00:33:41	00:33:43	I told you this?
603	00:33:43	00:33:52	Mm-hmm. You see, I'm thinking that the husband caught Wendy with the boyfriend and when she left his house he killed her in a jealous rage.
604	00:33:55	00:33:58	And this theory is based on...?
605	00:33:58	00:33:59	Nothing.
606	00:33:59	00:34:01	I'm just trying to help.
607	00:34:03	00:34:06	I'm going to the garage to meet Catherine.
608	00:34:06	00:34:07	You keep thinking, Butch.
609	00:34:07	00:34:09	That's what you're good at.
610	00:34:09	00:34:14	Hey. If this theory checks out, uh maybe we should talk about a raise.
611	00:34:14	00:34:15	Yeah.
612	00:34:36	00:34:39	I think I may have found some skin.
613	00:34:42	00:34:43	When Wendy hit her head.
614	00:34:45	00:34:47	Did you hear what I said?
615	00:34:51	00:34:52	Blood.
616	00:34:52	00:34:55	Blood?
617	00:34:55	00:34:56	You were at the autopsy.
618	00:34:56	00:34:58	The head trauma wasn't a bleeder.
619	00:34:59	00:35:00	Well, maybe she fought back.
620	00:35:00	00:35:02	Either way, we got to call Brass.
621	00:35:02	00:35:06	Tell them to bring the boyfriend in.
622	00:35:11	00:35:14	Could you wait right here, please?
623	00:35:14	00:35:15	Stay with Mr. Swelco.
624	00:35:17	00:35:19	How's it going?
625	00:35:19	00:35:23	Aah, you know, the usual beep-bap-bop, you know?
626	00:35:23	00:35:26	The guy said he cut his hand cleaning fish.
627	00:35:26	00:35:27	Got a tetanus shot.
628	00:35:27	00:35:29	That's his excuse for the blood we found on the boat.
629	00:35:29	00:35:31	But I'll call the clinic to confirm.
630	00:35:31	00:35:33	Damn, you're good.
631	00:35:33	00:35:35	Oh, shut up.
632	00:35:35	00:35:37	Stevie, hang with him.
633	00:35:38	00:35:41	Phil?
634	00:35:41	00:35:42	Phil Swelco?
635	00:35:43	00:35:44	Winston.
636	00:35:44	00:35:47	I heard about your wife.
637	00:35:47	00:35:48	I'm sorry.
638	00:35:48	00:35:49	What are you doing here?
639	00:35:50	00:35:51	Why are you questioning him?
640	00:35:51	00:35:55	Mr. Barger, why don't, you, um come over here with me.
641	00:35:55	00:35:56	Just walk over...
642	00:35:56	00:35:58	why don't we go in here sit down.
643	00:35:58	00:36:00	Have a seat.
644	00:36:03	00:36:05	I always knew she was seeing someone.
645	00:36:05	00:36:07	I just didn't know who.
646	00:36:07	00:36:10	Oh, I'm sorry.
647	00:36:10	00:36:13	She was having an affair with Phil Swelco?
648	00:36:13	00:36:16	And you think he killed her.
649	00:36:16	00:36:18	You just compromised our investigation.
650	00:36:18	00:36:20	He deserved to know the truth.
651	00:36:20	00:36:21	Knowing how she died, yes.
652	00:36:21	00:36:24	Knowing that she had an affair-- how does that bring closure?
653	00:36:24	00:36:27	I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand.
654	00:36:27	00:36:29	You can't make this about Eddie.
655	00:36:29	00:36:31	Look, you hurt our case because your ex hurt you.
656	00:36:31	00:36:33	We bring ourselves to our cases.
657	00:36:33	00:36:34	We can't help it.
658	00:36:34	00:36:35	I knew how Barger felt.
659	00:36:35	00:36:38	Would you relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse.
660	00:36:38	00:36:39	You can't give him anything, Catherine.
661	00:36:39	00:36:41	We're scientists.
662	00:36:41	00:36:44	We're not psychiatrists or victims' rights advocates.
663	00:36:44	00:36:46	You right, you know. I should be just like you.
664	00:36:46	00:36:52	Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching Discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships.
665	00:36:53	00:36:55	No chance any will slop over into a case.
666	00:36:55	00:36:57	Right. I want to be just like you.
667	00:36:58	00:37:00	Technically, it's a townhouse.
668	00:37:00	00:37:04	And the crosswords are advanced, not genius.
669	00:37:04	00:37:07	But you're right. I'm deficient in a lot of ways.
670	00:37:07	00:37:11	But I never screw up one of my cases with personal stuff.
671	00:37:11	00:37:14	Grissom...
672	00:37:14	00:37:16	what personal stuff?
673	00:37:19	00:37:21	Matt, I got to know.
674	00:37:21	00:37:23	How much did it tick Kyle off?
675	00:37:23	00:37:26	What are you talking about?
676	00:37:28	00:37:30	Jill.
677	00:37:32	00:37:35	Man, Kyle must've been steamed.
678	00:37:35	00:37:38	His girlfriend signs a pledge's privates?
679	00:37:38	00:37:40	Yeah, Kyle, can take a joke.
680	00:37:40	00:37:43	He didn't think it was funny enough to share it with us.
681	00:37:43	00:37:45	You know, I never met a guy who could just laugh that off.
682	00:37:45	00:37:50	Hey, Matt you know why I joined a fraternity?
683	00:37:50	00:37:54	'Cause I wanted to belong to something-- the brotherhood.
684	00:37:54	00:37:56	That's what it was all about for me you know what I mean?
685	00:37:56	00:37:58	So I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud.
686	00:37:58	00:38:04	You come clean, you might be able to save your house save the brotherhood, but...
687	00:38:04	00:38:07	if you don't...
688	00:38:07	00:38:10	You and Kyle both get charged with murder and the house goes dark.
689	00:38:10	00:38:15	Everything you're trying to protect you'll destroy.
690	00:38:16	00:38:20	Martie I found the string.
691	00:38:23	00:38:28	Now are you ready to tell us what happened after James got back to that house?
692	00:38:32	00:38:33	Okay.
693	00:38:33	00:38:36	Hey, let's see what Johnson came up with.
694	00:38:36	00:38:37	Yeah?
695	00:38:37	00:38:39	Yeah, let's see it, dude.
696	00:38:39	00:38:40	Show it!
697	00:38:45	00:38:46	Dude...
698	00:38:46	00:38:48	that's your girlfriend.
699	00:38:48	00:38:49	She signed it.
700	00:38:50	00:38:52	Did it hurt?
701	00:38:52	00:38:54	Meet me upstairs, pledge.
702	00:38:54	00:38:58	You're still behind in points.
703	00:38:58	00:39:01	So this is what we're going to do.
704	00:39:01	00:39:07	I'm going to put this down your throat You're going to swallow it and you're going to trust me to pull it back out.
705	00:39:08	00:39:09	Okay.
706	00:39:23	00:39:25	Dude, where's Johnson?
707	00:39:27	00:39:28	Oh, oh, this is crazy.
708	00:39:28	00:39:30	All right, all right, listen to me.
709	00:39:30	00:39:35	Anything goes down my father will bail out the Chapter.
710	00:39:35	00:39:39	Now you're just going to follow my lead and you're going to keep your mouth shut.
711	00:39:52	00:39:54	Is my dad here yet?
712	00:39:54	00:39:59	No, but when he gets here you can tell him first degree murder.
713	00:39:59	00:40:02	No way, come on. That's ridiculous.
714	00:40:02	00:40:04	Your boy rolled over on, Slick.
715	00:40:04	00:40:08	One thing about the fraternity upstate the brotherhood's fantastic.
716	00:40:08	00:40:09	Oh, yeah.
717	00:40:09	00:40:11	They gonna love you.
718	00:40:21	00:40:23	She ran out of gas.
719	00:40:23	00:40:25	Okay.
720	00:40:25	00:40:27	Get in the boat.
721	00:40:27	00:40:28	Pull the engine cord.
722	00:40:28	00:40:29	What?
723	00:40:29	00:40:31	Get in the boat.
724	00:40:31	00:40:32	Why?
725	00:40:32	00:40:33	Just indulge me, please?
726	00:40:33	00:40:36	There's no gas. It's not gonna start.
727	00:40:36	00:40:37	That's not the point.
728	00:40:37	00:40:39	As long as there is one.
729	00:40:48	00:40:50	Pull it again.
730	00:40:51	00:40:53	( grunts ) Go on.
731	00:40:53	00:40:54	More.
732	00:40:54	00:40:56	Harder.
733	00:40:56	00:40:58	Go on.
734	00:41:00	00:41:02	That's it. What's your point?
735	00:41:02	00:41:03	How does your shoulder feel?
736	00:41:03	00:41:04	It's sore.
737	00:41:06	00:41:09	You already knew that.
738	00:41:09	00:41:12	I know what happened to Wendy.
739	00:41:12	00:41:16	She says good night to Swelco and gets in the boat.
740	00:41:16	00:41:18	Halfway home, the boat runs out of gas.
741	00:41:18	00:41:21	Stranded in the middle of the lake, she panics.
742	00:41:21	00:41:24	Starts pulling on the engine chord.
743	00:41:24	00:41:28	She pulls so hard, she dislocates her shoulder and falls forward.
744	00:41:28	00:41:33	Wendy goes under, where she remains until Barger's propeller severs her leg.
745	00:41:33	00:41:37	She died before she ever hit the water.
746	00:41:39	00:41:41	It was just an accident.
747	00:41:41	00:41:44	Well, sometimes it's about what didn'thappen.
748	00:41:44	00:41:47	Well, I guess we better go talk to the husband.
749	00:41:47	00:41:51	I mean, unless you think I'm going to compromise the integrity of the case again.
750	00:41:51	00:41:53	Look...
751	00:41:53	00:41:55	Could we have a truce?
752	00:41:55	00:41:57	I would love to.
753	00:41:57	00:41:59	Good.
754	00:42:03	00:42:07	But let me do all the talking to the husband and the boyfriend.
755	00:42:09	00:42:12	He had to say it.
756	00:42:12	00:42:13	Hey.
757	00:42:16	00:42:18	I'll meet you outside, okay?
758	00:42:18	00:42:19	Okay.
759	00:42:19	00:42:20	Hey, Warrick.
760	00:42:20	00:42:21	Hey, Care.
761	00:42:21	00:42:23	Did it go okay?
762	00:42:23	00:42:24	Yeah. Fine.
763	00:42:24	00:42:26	Thanks for letting Brass handle it.
764	00:42:26	00:42:29	The fewer people who know about this the better.
765	00:42:29	00:42:32	I'm proud of you.
766	00:42:32	00:42:35	No, Judge Cohen's got a lot of soldiers.
767	00:42:35	00:42:38	Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.
768	00:42:38	00:42:41	You know, I can only help you out so much.
769	00:42:41	00:42:44	After that, it's up to you.
770	00:42:44	00:42:47	Yeah, I know.
771	00:42:52	00:42:54	Hello?!
772	00:42:54	00:42:56	Mr. Swelco?!
773	00:42:56	00:42:59	Mr. Swelco?!
774	00:43:20	00:43:23	He killed my wife.
775	00:43:25	00:43:28	We just came from your house.
776	00:43:28	00:43:33	We wanted to tell you that your wife's death was an accident.
777	00:43:34	00:43:36	What?
778	00:43:46	00:43:47	He didn't kill her.
