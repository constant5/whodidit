0	00:03:12	00:03:14	Mr. and Mrs. Decomp?
1	00:03:14	00:03:16	Till death do they centrifuge.
2	00:03:16	00:03:18	Yeah, I do know how to read a calendar.
3	00:03:18	00:03:20	I know when you're due in court.
4	00:03:20	00:03:22	I just have a backlog of my own here.
5	00:03:22	00:03:27	Well, when Riley left, it just kind of took us all by surprise.
6	00:03:27	00:03:31	She just left us with a hundred open cases, and we're shorthanded.
7	00:03:31	00:03:34	But I'll get to yours as soon as I can.
8	00:03:47	00:03:48	What is this for?
9	00:03:49	00:03:52	I am training myself to...
10	00:03:52	00:03:55	identify different knife wounds.
11	00:03:55	00:03:58	Do you know how much ballistics gel costs? Don't worry.
12	00:03:58	00:04:00	I'm gonna melt it down and reuse it.
13	00:04:00	00:04:03	You've had quite the busy summer.
14	00:04:03	00:04:05	Advanced Non-Invasive Tissue Imaging.
15	00:04:05	00:04:07	Raman Microspectroscopy.
16	00:04:07	00:04:10	You're already two courses over your training allotment for the whole year.
17	00:04:11	00:04:14	Yes, which is why I paid for them myself, and...
18	00:04:14	00:04:17	took my vacation time...
19	00:04:17	00:04:18	to do them.
20	00:04:18	00:04:20	I know. I like the attitude.
21	00:04:21	00:04:24	You're now officially a CSI-2.
22	00:04:24	00:04:26	Congratulations.
23	00:04:36	00:04:39	Well, this one'll put you off driving for a while.
24	00:04:39	00:04:42	We've got one fatality, and another circling the drain.
25	00:04:42	00:04:46	The driver of the SUV's from L.A.-- prior DUI.
26	00:04:47	00:04:49	Why the red flag?
27	00:04:49	00:04:52	Yeah, it's a lot of press for a traffic accident.
28	00:04:52	00:04:54	They're here for her.
29	00:05:03	00:05:07	Oh, man! That's Olivia Hamilton.
30	00:05:07	00:05:09	The actress?
31	00:05:09	00:05:11	Yeah.
32	00:05:11	00:05:16	I just saw her in that pool hustler movie with Robert Downey, Jr.
33	00:05:16	00:05:17	I liked her.
34	00:05:17	00:05:19	No! No! Move! Move!
35	00:05:19	00:05:21	Olivia!
36	00:05:21	00:05:24	Sir, wait here. Olivia!
37	00:05:24	00:05:25	Olivia!
38	00:05:27	00:05:29	Olivia!
39	00:05:30	00:05:31	No! I have to see her!
40	00:05:33	00:05:35	No traffic cameras.
41	00:05:37	00:05:40	Typical for this part of town.
42	00:05:55	00:05:57	What is it, Ray?
43	00:05:57	00:05:59	Pulverized rubber.
44	00:05:59	00:06:00	Tire dust.
45	00:06:00	00:06:06	The driver of the SUV kept his foot on the gas after he crashed into the other vehicle.
46	00:06:07	00:06:08	We got a pulse.
47	00:06:08	00:06:10	This is one lucky son of a gun.
48	00:06:10	00:06:11	Let's get him out of here stat.
49	00:06:13	00:06:16	Looks we may have an eyewitness.
50	00:06:16	00:06:17	That should add to the circus.
51	00:06:18	00:06:21	Doesn't really matter what he has to say.
52	00:06:21	00:06:24	Everything we need to know...
53	00:06:24	00:06:27	is right here in front of us.
54	00:06:59	00:07:03	I'm still learning About myself, my craft.
55	00:07:03	00:07:08	I guess with every new role, I try and stretch myself a little bit more because...
56	00:07:08	00:07:12	I think the minute you stop learning...
57	00:07:12	00:07:14	you're dead.
58	00:07:53	00:07:57	There's no scoring and no horizontal scrape marks on her car.
59	00:07:58	00:08:00	Hey, come on, people! Stay back!
60	00:08:00	00:08:01	Back behind the line! Let's go!
61	00:08:01	00:08:06	And there are none on the bumper of the SUV, so...
62	00:08:06	00:08:08	she was stopped when he hit her.
63	00:08:24	00:08:31	These yaw marks indicate a gradual turn through the intersection.
64	00:08:31	00:08:32	There's no fresh braking marks, man.
65	00:08:32	00:08:36	This SUV didn't even try to stop.
66	00:08:37	00:08:42	Maybe he passed out, lost control of the vehicle.
67	00:08:42	00:08:45	If he did that, then how'd he keep his foot on the gas?
68	00:08:47	00:08:53	Busy morning. We've got a possible 420 at a weekly on... Boulder Highway.
69	00:08:53	00:08:55	Greg, you take it.
70	00:08:55	00:08:57	Are you serious?
71	00:08:57	00:09:00	You're sending me on a trash run to a fleabag motel?
72	00:09:00	00:09:02	What's the problem?
73	00:09:02	00:09:05	Why me? I mean, there are people here with less seniority.
74	00:09:05	00:09:08	Present and accounted for. It's all right.
75	00:09:08	00:09:10	No, no, that's not the point, Ray.
76	00:09:10	00:09:13	When your supervisor assigns you a case, you don't whine about it, you take it; he knows that.
77	00:09:13	00:09:15	Who asked you? Nick, I need you over here.
78	00:09:15	00:09:20	You know better than that. Greg, why don't you go around the other side of the vehicle. Fine.
79	00:09:28	00:09:31	Captain, I'm Tom O'Neill.
80	00:09:31	00:09:34	I handle Denny's security when he's here in the States.
81	00:09:34	00:09:36	I know who you are.
82	00:09:36	00:09:40	You mind waiting outside? Actually, I'd prefer to stay with my client.
83	00:09:40	00:09:41	It won't take long.
84	00:09:41	00:09:42	All right.
85	00:09:45	00:09:47	So, uh, Denny...
86	00:09:47	00:09:50	looks like you hit it pretty hard at the club last night.
87	00:09:50	00:09:52	You want something for that hangover?
88	00:09:52	00:09:55	Coffee, water, or anything?
89	00:09:58	00:10:03	You want to tell me what Olivia was doing on that road 00 in the morning?
90	00:10:03	00:10:06	She was on her way to the set.
91	00:10:06	00:10:08	She was making a movie.
92	00:10:08	00:10:10	I see.
93	00:10:10	00:10:14	Olivia and I, we've been together, it would've been a year this weekend.
94	00:10:14	00:10:16	I'm sorry.
95	00:10:16	00:10:17	I'm sorry for your loss.
96	00:10:18	00:10:20	You know, if there's something we can do...
97	00:10:20	00:10:22	You can put a bullet in the head of the guy who killed her.
98	00:10:24	00:10:27	Mr. Ocampo, let me give you some advice, okay?
99	00:10:27	00:10:29	Your father owns a casino.
100	00:10:29	00:10:35	He probably has a lot of enemies, don't make statements like that in public.
101	00:10:35	00:10:37	It'll only come back to hurt you.
102	00:10:38	00:10:43	The film world is reeling from the untimely death of Olivia Hamilton.
103	00:10:43	00:10:47	Her life was cut short by a car crash early this morning.
104	00:10:47	00:10:53	It happened on an otherwise empty street, and the lack of eyewitnesses is slowing down the police investigation.
105	00:10:53	00:10:55	One cannot overestimate...
106	00:10:55	00:10:58	Is the sock still in it? Yeah.
107	00:10:58	00:11:02	No wallet, no I.D.
108	00:11:02	00:11:05	Was probably robbed after the murder.
109	00:11:05	00:11:08	He's been dead two days, minimum.
110	00:11:08	00:11:21	Half the department gets to work a dead hot movie star in front of the national media, but we end up on the wrong side of town in a scumbag incubator that's good for at least a couple of these every week, wasting our time on a...
111	00:11:21	00:11:22	On what?
112	00:11:22	00:11:31	An old man who gets tossed around this dump fighting for his life till he gets his skull smashed in?
113	00:11:31	00:11:35	Whoever would do this is worth getting off the street.
114	00:11:35	00:11:36	Don't you think?
115	00:11:36	00:11:38	Yeah.
116	00:11:38	00:11:39	Definitely.
117	00:11:39	00:11:41	Sorry.
118	00:12:04	00:12:06	Seven Hills Mortuary?
119	00:12:08	00:12:10	Yep, this one's yours.
120	00:12:17	00:12:20	That's quite the ghoulish hobby you got there, Doc.
121	00:12:20	00:12:21	I'm quite the ghoul.
122	00:12:24	00:12:27	She had a bit part in a Sex and the City I saw.
123	00:12:27	00:12:30	Even then, I could tell she was going to be a star.
124	00:12:30	00:12:32	Well, now, she'll never grow old.
125	00:12:32	00:12:36	C.O.D. was internal hemorrhage from a transection of the descending aorta.
126	00:12:36	00:12:38	Classic for a side impact.
127	00:12:38	00:12:40	Tox?
128	00:12:40	00:12:41	Preliminary's clean.
129	00:12:41	00:12:43	She was pregnant.
130	00:12:43	00:12:46	Fetus measured 19 millimeters.
131	00:12:46	00:12:48	Eighth week.
132	00:12:48	00:12:50	That's long enough for her to know.
133	00:12:50	00:12:52	Thank you.
134	00:12:53	00:12:55	It's just not fair.
135	00:12:55	00:12:58	A loser like that taking the life of a talented young woman.
136	00:12:58	00:13:02	I'd be stunned if his BAC came back under point one.
137	00:13:02	00:13:04	I could smell the booze on his clothes.
138	00:13:04	00:13:05	Is he going to make it?
139	00:13:06	00:13:09	Ah, he's not dead yet, which is a minor miracle in itself.
140	00:13:09	00:13:12	His C-2 vertebra was crushed.
141	00:13:12	00:13:13	Hangman's fracture.
142	00:13:13	00:13:15	Classic hyperextension injury.
143	00:13:15	00:13:19	Paramedics said he wasn't wearing his safety belt.
144	00:13:19	00:13:22	So the airbag probably hit the side of his face, twisting the neck.
145	00:13:25	00:13:29	Hmm. And somehow the drunk manages to survive.
146	00:13:33	00:13:36	Heard from some uniforms that you guys had a little dust-up at the scene.
147	00:13:36	00:13:38	It was just a spirited debate among colleagues.
148	00:13:38	00:13:40	My team's very passionate about their work.
149	00:13:40	00:13:44	Yeah, they're also understaffed and have been for a while, which is why I'm adding another CSI to your shift.
150	00:13:44	00:13:46	Ugh, Conrad.
151	00:13:46	00:13:47	I don't have time to train anybody new.
152	00:13:47	00:13:48	Don't worry. This one's been around the block.
153	00:13:48	00:13:50	You're going to get along just fine.
154	00:13:52	00:14:01	Richard Wilkes had a blood alcohol level of point one-eight; he also had GHB in his system to the tune of 60 milligrams per liter.
155	00:14:01	00:14:02	Guy obviously liked to party.
156	00:14:02	00:14:04	Copy that.
157	00:14:04	00:14:07	Think it's safe to say his judgment was impaired.
158	00:14:07	00:14:09	This could be the culprit.
159	00:14:09	00:14:11	Henry...
160	00:14:11	00:14:14	find out what that is for me, please.
161	00:14:17	00:14:23	According to the SMDs, Wilkes traveled 3.2 miles from his last engine stop.
162	00:14:23	00:14:27	Now, how do you drive that far, that wasted, and still stay on the road?
163	00:14:27	00:14:29	Individual tolerances vary.
164	00:14:29	00:14:31	Just ask Keith Richards.
165	00:14:35	00:14:36	Want to take a look at this?
166	00:14:36	00:14:38	Yes.
167	00:14:55	00:14:56	Dearest Richard, thank you for your letter.
168	00:14:56	00:14:58	It was so sweet and so real.
169	00:14:58	00:15:01	Love, always, Olivia.
170	00:15:05	00:15:11	This wasn't some random drunk accidentally slamming into a famous actress.
171	00:15:11	00:15:13	He was stalking her.
172	00:15:22	00:15:33	The call sheet that we found in Olivia Hamilton's car indicates the time that she was due on the movie set, along with a map from her hotel to the location.
173	00:15:33	00:15:35	The same information was on Richard Wilkes' computer.
174	00:15:35	00:15:38	We think he hacked into the film company's virtual production office.
175	00:15:38	00:15:41	He knew where she was gonna be and when she was gonna be there.
176	00:15:41	00:15:42	In other words, he ambushed her.
177	00:15:42	00:15:43	Mm-hmm. Maybe.
178	00:15:43	00:15:45	There are some inconsistencies.
179	00:15:45	00:15:47	Like what?
180	00:15:47	00:15:55	The duct tape, the rope, the knife we found-- all these things suggest that Wilkes was thinking to kidnap Olivia, that he wanted to possess her.
181	00:15:55	00:16:01	His crashing his car into hers without wearing a seat belt makes it seem like he was suicidal.
182	00:16:01	00:16:03	The man was intoxicated.
183	00:16:03	00:16:12	Well, celebrity stalkers who kill are driven by an overwhelming desire to achieve fame by murdering someone who's famous.
184	00:16:12	00:16:17	If he killed himself at the same time as Olivia, he would've missed his chance to bask in the limelight.
185	00:16:17	00:16:23	All right, look, guys, I got a press conference in an hour, and I'd rather not say something I'll have to backtrack on later on.
186	00:16:23	00:16:27	Did Wilkes intentionally kill Olivia Hamilton?
187	00:16:27	00:16:29	I'd say so. I doubt it.
188	00:16:29	00:16:31	Maybe you should cancel the press conference.
189	00:16:35	00:16:38	Well, looks like we got someone who can clear things up.
190	00:16:42	00:16:44	Richard...
191	00:16:44	00:16:45	Hey, Richard.
192	00:16:45	00:16:49	My name is Jim Brass.
193	00:16:49	00:16:50	Oh... I'm a detective.
194	00:16:50	00:16:53	Do you know why you're here?
195	00:16:54	00:16:56	I killed Olivia.
196	00:16:56	00:16:59	Yeah, you did.
197	00:16:59	00:17:00	How'd that happen?
198	00:17:03	00:17:06	We spoke with the people Olivia works with.
199	00:17:06	00:17:10	They said you went by the set the day before, asking to see her.
200	00:17:13	00:17:16	She got you booted off the set.
201	00:17:17	00:17:19	So you get mad and...
202	00:17:19	00:17:22	you went to an intersection where you knew she would be.
203	00:17:22	00:17:23	She rolls up, stops at a light.
204	00:17:24	00:17:27	Love always...
205	00:17:28	00:17:29	Olivia.
206	00:17:29	00:17:31	What?
207	00:17:31	00:17:34	Her letter.
208	00:17:34	00:17:37	She loved herself.
209	00:17:37	00:17:39	Yeah, right.
210	00:17:43	00:17:46	This angle is looking straight down Bridger.
211	00:17:46	00:17:51	Unfortunately, the crash site itself is obscured, but I figured, you know, see what we can see.
212	00:17:51	00:17:53	And where did this come from?
213	00:17:53	00:17:57	A patrolman noticed a camera on a warehouse about a quarter-mile from the intersection.
214	00:17:57	00:18:01	Okay, this is about the time the accident was reported to 911.
215	00:18:01	00:18:02	I'll roll it back.
216	00:18:07	00:18:10	Dr. Langston, these just came for you.
217	00:18:15	00:18:17	Shooting Review Board?
218	00:18:17	00:18:18	Yeah.
219	00:18:25	00:18:27	They cleared me.
220	00:18:29	00:18:31	Good.
221	00:18:31	00:18:32	Kill or be killed, Ray.
222	00:18:32	00:18:33	It's a terrible situation to be in, man.
223	00:18:34	00:18:35	Don't let it bother you.
224	00:18:35	00:18:38	It hasn't been bothering me.
225	00:18:38	00:18:41	And that's what's been bothering me.
226	00:18:47	00:18:48	That's Olivia's car.
227	00:18:54	00:18:56	That's her, all right.
228	00:18:56	00:18:58	I'll roll it forward.
229	00:18:58	00:19:02	Now she's approaching the intersection at Hasbrook.
230	00:19:02	00:19:05	Damn, if that camera were just a couple feet higher, we could see the crash.
231	00:19:06	00:19:07	Light turns red, she stops at the intersection.
232	00:19:07	00:19:10	That puts the crash time at 27 a.m.
233	00:19:10	00:19:11	Yeah...
234	00:19:11	00:19:14	but look at all the lights on Bridger.
235	00:19:14	00:19:16	They're all green, except for hers.
236	00:19:16	00:19:17	So?
237	00:19:17	00:19:18	So I know that street pretty well.
238	00:19:18	00:19:20	Those traffic signals are synced.
239	00:19:20	00:19:23	Her light should be green, like the rest of them.
240	00:19:23	00:19:27	What's the white light on the traffic signal?
241	00:19:30	00:19:33	That's a confirmation light for a traffic signal preemption.
242	00:19:33	00:19:39	Looks like somebody overrode the normal timing, forcing Olivia's light to turn red.
243	00:19:39	00:19:42	Making her a sitting duck.
244	00:19:42	00:19:45	Tom O'Neill, Guardian of the Stars?
245	00:19:45	00:19:46	Hey.
246	00:19:46	00:19:47	David Hodges.
247	00:19:47	00:19:49	Uh, w-we met at Lavo.
248	00:19:49	00:19:50	The CineVegas after-party.
249	00:19:50	00:19:53	You were parting the seas for Tarantino.
250	00:19:53	00:19:55	Uh...
251	00:19:55	00:19:56	Actually, it was, uh, outside of Lavo.
252	00:19:56	00:19:57	I couldn't get past the rope.
253	00:19:58	00:20:01	Next time, you flash this.
254	00:20:01	00:20:02	That'll get you inside.
255	00:20:02	00:20:03	Thanks.
256	00:20:03	00:20:05	Always glad to help a brother in blue.
257	00:20:05	00:20:07	Where are we at with Wilkes?
258	00:20:07	00:20:09	Oh, uh, yeah, he confessed.
259	00:20:09	00:20:10	But we're not sold on it.
260	00:20:10	00:20:12	Something just doesn't add up.
261	00:20:14	00:20:16	Denny, you okay?
262	00:20:21	00:20:22	Hi. (nervous laugh)
263	00:20:22	00:20:24	Gentlemen.
264	00:20:24	00:20:26	They're ready downstairs.
265	00:20:33	00:20:34	David.
266	00:20:34	00:20:36	Sorry, we are really backed up.
267	00:21:10	00:21:16	The only way anybody could change Olivia's traffic light is with an infrared emitter.
268	00:21:16	00:21:19	LVPD and fire department emitters are coded for identification.
269	00:21:20	00:21:21	Uncoded emitters are against the law.
270	00:21:21	00:21:29	D.O.T. records confirm 27 a.m., an uncoded MIRT infrared emitter preempted the signal at Bridger and Hasbrook.
271	00:21:33	00:21:39	If Wilkes was using an illegal emitter, why didn't we find it in his car or at the scene?
272	00:21:43	00:21:45	What are you thinking, Ray?
273	00:21:45	00:21:47	I'll tell you if I can prove it.
274	00:21:56	00:21:59	Are you a reporter?
275	00:21:59	00:22:01	I'm from the crime lab.
276	00:22:01	00:22:04	Oh.
277	00:22:04	00:22:08	I heard there are a lot of reporters out there.
278	00:22:08	00:22:10	They're all here to talk to me, you know?
279	00:22:10	00:22:13	Everybody wants to talk to me now.
280	00:22:13	00:22:17	They've even been bothering the poor nurses.
281	00:22:17	00:22:20	I feel so exploited.
282	00:22:20	00:22:25	They're not interested in discovering who I really am.
283	00:22:25	00:22:27	They just want to make money off me.
284	00:22:27	00:22:30	I watched a segment on TV la...
285	00:22:30	00:22:31	Your O2 sat is very low, Mr. Wilkes.
286	00:22:31	00:22:34	Oh. Oh...
287	00:22:34	00:22:37	Now you're in perfectly good hands. I am a doctor.
288	00:22:37	00:22:43	I mean, I was a doctor until I was forced out of my profession.
289	00:22:43	00:22:45	It was one of those angel of death things, you know?
290	00:22:45	00:22:47	Huh? You see, no one really understood the real me.
291	00:22:47	00:22:50	A-And what...?
292	00:22:51	00:22:53	Would you close your eyes for me?
293	00:22:53	00:22:56	(laser beeps) And try to relax.
294	00:22:56	00:22:58	Oh, wait a minute.
295	00:22:58	00:23:01	Shh. This will be over in just a moment.
296	00:23:01	00:23:05	ALS revealed subcutaneous bruising on Wilkes' torso.
297	00:23:05	00:23:08	Looks like a seat belt injury.
298	00:23:08	00:23:10	First responder said he wasn't wearing a seat belt.
299	00:23:10	00:23:14	I know. Look, the bruising runs from his right shoulder to his left hip.
300	00:23:14	00:23:17	That means Wilkes was in the passenger seat.
301	00:23:17	00:23:18	He wasn't driving the car.
302	00:23:18	00:23:23	The real driver crashes into Olivia Hamilton, killing her.
303	00:23:23	00:23:26	I don't think the crash broke Wilkes' neck.
304	00:23:26	00:23:31	I think the killer moved a drugged-out Wilkes behind the wheel, then snapped his neck.
305	00:23:31	00:23:32	Killer leaves the scene.
306	00:23:32	00:23:36	The headline is, Stalker Kills Actress.
307	00:23:36	00:23:39	Which suggests that the killer knew that Wilkes was a stalker.
308	00:23:39	00:23:40	Well, he certainly picked the right nut job.
309	00:23:40	00:23:42	Even though Wilkes survived, he still confessed to the crime.
310	00:23:43	00:23:44	Can Wilkes corroborate any of this?
311	00:23:44	00:23:45	Oh, he won't.
312	00:23:45	00:23:48	He's too happy being the new Mark David Chapman.
313	00:23:48	00:23:50	I really hope you're referring to Richard Wilkes.
314	00:23:50	00:23:51	I wasn't.
315	00:23:52	00:23:55	Where'd they get this from?
316	00:23:55	00:23:56	I don't know. You tell me.
317	00:23:56	00:23:58	I don't know.
318	00:23:58	00:23:59	It's your job to know, Catherine.
319	00:23:59	00:24:05	Nobody in this lab should be talking to anybody in the media about an open investigation, let alone one of this profile.
320	00:24:06	00:24:07	Hey, take it easy, Ecklie.
321	00:24:07	00:24:08	I'm sure she's not the leak.
322	00:24:08	00:24:09	I can defend myself.
323	00:24:09	00:24:10	This is a discipline problem, Catherine.
324	00:24:10	00:24:12	Just get a grip on your people.
325	00:24:12	00:24:14	I'm beginning to think Riley was right about you.
326	00:24:14	00:24:15	What is that supposed to mean?
327	00:24:15	00:24:17	You didn't read her exit interview.
328	00:24:17	00:24:18	I put it on your desk.
329	00:24:18	00:24:20	What? Just read it.
330	00:24:20	00:24:22	Uh, hi, guys.
331	00:24:22	00:24:24	This a bad time?
332	00:24:28	00:24:30	Nice to meet you, and I look forward to working with you.
333	00:24:30	00:24:32	Thanks. Me, too.
334	00:24:32	00:24:33	I'll see you later, yeah? Yeah.
335	00:24:33	00:24:35	So let's grab a bite after the shift. Okay.
336	00:24:35	00:24:36	Sara!
337	00:24:39	00:24:41	What are you doing here?
338	00:24:41	00:24:46	You tired of being happy and married?
339	00:24:46	00:24:55	No, Grissom is guest-lecturing at the Sorbonne while we're waiting for our research grant to get funded, and Ecklie called; he said the team was down a man and he wondered if I could recommend anyone.
340	00:24:55	00:25:01	And you know, as much as I love Paris, and my French is actually pretty good right now, I realized I miss you guys.
341	00:25:01	00:25:05	Well, we miss you, too.
342	00:25:05	00:25:07	So, uh, how's the world treating you?
343	00:25:08	00:25:12	Oh, you know, still being treated like the lab tech with the crazy hair.
344	00:25:50	00:25:54	It has ten percent of the FDA's daily requirement for vitamin C.
345	00:25:54	00:25:59	If you don't have your health, you don't have anything.
346	00:25:59	00:26:01	Hodges, who did you blab to?
347	00:26:01	00:26:03	Nobody in the media, (scoffs)
348	00:26:03	00:26:06	but I did mention something to Tom O'Neill.
349	00:26:06	00:26:10	But only in passing and implicitly in confidence.
350	00:26:10	00:26:17	I would point out that I had not been explicitly forbidden from discussing the case with law enforcement community.
351	00:26:17	00:26:24	Uh, memo from my supervisor to that effect would have been helpful, not that I'm blaming you.
352	00:26:26	00:26:27	Don't ever do anything like that ever again.
353	00:26:27	00:26:30	Thank you.
354	00:26:46	00:26:49	I know Richard Wilkes stayed here. You remember him?
355	00:26:49	00:26:52	Uh, you know, I guess I recognize him.
356	00:26:52	00:26:55	You know, he looks like a lot of guys that stay here.
357	00:26:55	00:26:57	Sir, please, it's important. Think a little bit harder.
358	00:26:57	00:26:58	Are you sure you didn't see him with anybody else?
359	00:26:58	00:27:03	No. All I can say for sure is that he checked out two nights ago around midnight. Paid cash.
360	00:27:03	00:27:05	All right, thanks. Sure.
361	00:27:07	00:27:08	Hey.
362	00:27:08	00:27:11	Eye-in-the-sky guys delivered some surveillance video.
363	00:27:11	00:27:16	Good. 'Cause the manager confirmed Wilkes stayed here, but that's about it.
364	00:27:16	00:27:19	Hey, looks like he managed to make himself a friend.
365	00:27:26	00:27:29	Is that...?
366	00:27:29	00:27:30	That's Tom O'Neill.
367	00:27:30	00:27:35	Talking to Olivia Hamilton's stalker a little over three hours before she died.
368	00:27:35	00:27:37	It's funny he didn't manage to mention that to anybody.
369	00:27:37	00:27:40	Little lie, big lie.
370	00:27:40	00:27:42	What if O'Neill was the driver?
371	00:27:42	00:27:48	If O'Neill was driving, then how come he didn't get so much as a scratch from the airbag opening up in his face?
372	00:27:54	00:27:56	Well, rolling the dice.
373	00:27:56	00:27:59	That's a, that's a different way to grieve.
374	00:27:59	00:28:01	He has the right to grieve any way he wants.
375	00:28:01	00:28:02	Now if there's any more questions...
376	00:28:02	00:28:04	Actually, I have questions for you.
377	00:28:04	00:28:06	Sure, no problem.
378	00:28:07	00:28:09	Hang in there, kid.
379	00:28:12	00:28:15	Did you know that Olivia was pregnant?
380	00:28:15	00:28:17	Yes.
381	00:28:17	00:28:18	You didn't mention that before.
382	00:28:18	00:28:20	It's none of your business.
383	00:28:20	00:28:26	We spoke to Olivia's production office, and they told us that you would ride to the set with her nearly every morning.
384	00:28:26	00:28:27	Why not that morning?
385	00:28:33	00:28:34	I wish I had.
386	00:28:36	00:28:38	I was gonna give her this.
387	00:29:05	00:29:10	When I heard about the incident on Olivia's set, I put a tail on Wilkes.
388	00:29:10	00:29:11	I found where he was staying.
389	00:29:11	00:29:13	Olivia Hamilton wasn't your client.
390	00:29:13	00:29:15	A threat to her was a threat to Denny.
391	00:29:15	00:29:17	So I went and had a little chat with Wilkes.
392	00:29:17	00:29:26	If you don't leave Olivia Hamilton alone, I'm gonna go to that aerospace plant where you polish the floors and I'm gonna show Mr. Segal.
393	00:29:26	00:29:29	That's right. I know your boss's name.
394	00:29:29	00:29:33	I'll show Mr. Segal my card, and I'll tell him to fire you.
395	00:29:33	00:29:34	He'll ask me why.
396	00:29:35	00:29:38	And I'll say because you're a stalker and a psycho.
397	00:29:38	00:29:41	And then he'll fire you.
398	00:29:41	00:29:44	Then I'll go to my cop friends, and I'll get a restraining order.
399	00:29:44	00:29:50	And when you violate it-- because sooner or later you will-- I'm gonna throw your ass in jail.
400	00:29:50	00:29:53	I impressed him with my sincerity, and he agreed to leave town.
401	00:29:53	00:29:55	I walked him back to his room.
402	00:29:55	00:30:00	I helped him pack, and I put him in his car and I followed him to the I-15 on-ramp.
403	00:30:00	00:30:03	Watched him get back on the road to L.A.
404	00:30:03	00:30:04	Apparently not for long.
405	00:30:04	00:30:07	You can understand why I didn't tell you all this before.
406	00:30:07	00:30:08	No, I understand.
407	00:30:08	00:30:11	You lean on a guy, the guy flips out, kills your client's girlfriend.
408	00:30:11	00:30:12	That can't look good on your resumé.
409	00:30:12	00:30:14	I-I couldn't afford the hit.
410	00:30:14	00:30:15	I got six hungry bookies to feed.
411	00:30:16	00:30:17	Oh, yeah, sure.
412	00:30:17	00:30:18	Hey...
413	00:30:18	00:30:20	what's in the bag?
414	00:30:20	00:30:23	Workout stuff. I was at the gym.
415	00:30:23	00:30:25	30 at night?
416	00:30:25	00:30:29	Crazy hours I pull, you grab a little cardio whenever you can.
417	00:30:29	00:30:31	Well, let's just see if that's true.
418	00:30:33	00:30:36	I assume you had a warrant for that?
419	00:30:36	00:30:38	Oh, sure, we're professionals.
420	00:30:38	00:30:43	Mr. O'Neill, I have to say that your hotel suite was very impressive.
421	00:30:43	00:30:47	The Ocampo family clearly values your services.
422	00:30:47	00:30:49	Now why are you carrying around this helmet?
423	00:30:49	00:30:52	I use that for a tactical driving course I teach.
424	00:30:54	00:30:57	And can you tell me what that white powdery substance is?
425	00:30:57	00:30:59	Uh-uh.
426	00:30:59	00:31:02	We are testing it, of course.
427	00:31:02	00:31:04	Here's my prediction.
428	00:31:04	00:31:05	It's airbag dust.
429	00:31:05	00:31:07	Tactical driving, you bump into things.
430	00:31:07	00:31:08	Airbags go off.
431	00:31:08	00:31:13	They also go off when you ram a young woman's car and crush her to death.
432	00:31:13	00:31:14	Now, maybe Denny loved Olivia. I don't know.
433	00:31:14	00:31:17	But I bet his father in Macao didn't.
434	00:31:17	00:31:19	Not with Denny's record.
435	00:31:19	00:31:23	Another pregnant bimbo, another multimillion-dollar settlement.
436	00:31:23	00:31:27	Mr. Ocampo, who pays your salary, who finances your...
437	00:31:27	00:31:28	Flamboyant.
438	00:31:28	00:31:36	...lifestyle, I think he asked you to find a more cost-effective way of dealing with the situation, and so you did.
439	00:31:48	00:31:51	Too bad for you Wilkes already confessed.
440	00:31:56	00:31:59	I want a lawyer.
441	00:32:00	00:32:05	Hodges confirmed that the dust we found in the helmet was airbag talc.
442	00:32:05	00:32:09	Which only puts O'Neill in half of all cars with airbags.
443	00:32:09	00:32:10	He's guilty, Catherine.
444	00:32:10	00:32:12	Okay, how are we gonna prove it?
445	00:32:12	00:32:14	I don't know yet, but we will.
446	00:32:16	00:32:17	I like his attitude.
447	00:32:17	00:32:19	Reminds you of you?
448	00:32:19	00:32:24	I checked companies that sell Murray emitters against O'Neill's credit card statements.
449	00:32:24	00:32:26	No joy. He could have his own emitter.
450	00:32:26	00:32:28	The old ones aren't coded.
451	00:32:28	00:32:30	So what's next?
452	00:32:32	00:32:38	Sara, I know that you walked into some fireworks in the break room.
453	00:32:38	00:32:43	What, Ecklie? Please.
454	00:32:43	00:32:45	No, I just read Riley's exit interview.
455	00:32:45	00:33:00	She had some harsh things to say about my leadership; that the team's fractured; that it lacks cohesion because of me because of my managerial style.
456	00:33:02	00:33:04	I don't know. I-I admit it.
457	00:33:04	00:33:09	I admit that things are different since Grissom left.
458	00:33:09	00:33:13	Well... it's like...
459	00:33:13	00:33:19	when a great baseball team loses its clean-up hitter, suddenly everybody's swinging for the fences and nobody's playing small ball.
460	00:33:19	00:33:23	You're using a baseball analogy.
461	00:33:23	00:33:29	Apparently, part of being married is attempting to share in your spouse's interests.
462	00:33:30	00:33:34	Okay. That's a weird side of you.
463	00:33:34	00:33:36	I know.
464	00:33:36	00:33:41	Look, you still have a lot of great players and some new talent.
465	00:33:41	00:33:44	Maybe you just need to reshuffle your lineup.
466	00:33:44	00:33:46	English, please.
467	00:33:47	00:33:51	You are a great CSI, Catherine, and you know how to manage your team.
468	00:33:52	00:34:00	The only thing Grissom had that you don't...
469	00:34:01	00:34:03	is you.
470	00:34:12	00:34:14	Oh, God.
471	00:34:19	00:34:21	Hey, who are you?
472	00:34:21	00:34:22	Hello? Excuse me, excuse me.
473	00:34:23	00:34:25	Hey, hey, stop!
474	00:34:25	00:34:29	What the hell is going on here?!
475	00:34:38	00:34:40	Security!
476	00:35:22	00:35:23	You okay? Are you okay?
477	00:35:31	00:35:33	On your feet!
478	00:35:37	00:35:39	Settle down!
479	00:35:55	00:35:57	The doctor said both of our people are stable.
480	00:35:58	00:35:59	Good.
481	00:35:59	00:36:04	Okay, I got the van's plate number out on broadcast and Ecklie's handling the press.
482	00:36:04	00:36:05	Any idea who they were?
483	00:36:06	00:36:10	Well, they're not morticians, no matter what their IDs say, and these...
484	00:36:10	00:36:12	are Russian mob tattoos.
485	00:36:12	00:36:16	Which means we're going to get a lot more out of him than we will out of any of the survivors.
486	00:36:16	00:36:20	The IDs looked legit so the security guard let them in through the loading dock.
487	00:36:20	00:36:21	They snatched the body.
488	00:36:21	00:36:26	When they tried to leave the same way they came in, they found the doors blocked by a double-parked truck.
489	00:36:26	00:36:28	So they found another way out, okay.
490	00:36:28	00:36:32	But why risk breaking into a lab filled with cops to steal Olivia Hamilton's body?
491	00:36:32	00:36:35	They didn't take Olivia Hamilton.
492	00:36:35	00:36:37	They took my bum?
493	00:36:37	00:36:38	But we don't even know who he is.
494	00:36:38	00:36:40	Well, clearly they do.
495	00:36:40	00:36:42	Hey, guys, you're not going to believe this.
496	00:36:42	00:36:46	The DNA from your John Doe just came back with a parental match to an open case.
497	00:36:46	00:36:49	That bum is Olivia Hamilton's father.
498	00:36:51	00:36:58	All units be advised, suspect vehicle in the lab break-in was recovered on Westcroft Drive at mile marker 214, Mount Charleston.
499	00:36:58	00:36:59	Hey. Hey.
500	00:37:01	00:37:04	Oh, no.
501	00:37:04	00:37:06	This doesn't look good.
502	00:37:11	00:37:14	Well, so much for Olivia Hamilton's father.
503	00:37:14	00:37:15	Ugh.
504	00:37:15	00:37:17	It might not be him.
505	00:37:19	00:37:22	Mmm. (coughs, clears throat)
506	00:37:30	00:37:33	You, uh, care to rethink that?
507	00:37:33	00:37:41	According to James Hamilton's medical records, he was a diagnosed schizophrenic prone to violent outbursts.
508	00:37:41	00:37:51	Olivia Hamilton was his only child, and she did the best she could taking care of him, but he was in and out of institutions and on and off the streets for years.
509	00:37:51	00:37:55	Now from what I can tell, their relationship was never made public.
510	00:37:55	00:37:58	It's a minor miracle she was able to keep it out of the tabs.
511	00:37:58	00:38:01	That might have been about to change.
512	00:38:01	00:38:03	We found these shots on O'Neill's camera.
513	00:38:03	00:38:05	Recovered JPEGs from the SD card.
514	00:38:05	00:38:11	They were taken in front of the weekly where James Hamilton was living two days before Olivia Hamilton's death.
515	00:38:11	00:38:14	We got O'Neill's financials.
516	00:38:14	00:38:19	Like we figured, Denny's father, Mr. Moneybags from Macau, pays his salary.
517	00:38:19	00:38:26	One week ago, O'Neill receives an unusually large deposit-- a hundred grand-- wired from an Asian bank.
518	00:38:26	00:38:29	Maybe paying him to break up Denny's latest romance.
519	00:38:29	00:38:32	O'Neill shadows Olivia, trying to dig up some dirt.
520	00:38:32	00:38:37	Follows her to the weekly where she meets up with this very strange old man.
521	00:38:37	00:38:39	He could be a drug dealer. Who knows?
522	00:38:39	00:38:41	But it looks like the perfect material to incite a break-up.
523	00:38:41	00:38:43	So he takes a couple shots of them.
524	00:38:43	00:38:45	But he's curious.
525	00:38:45	00:38:48	So he goes to the room to talk to the guy and see what the story is.
526	00:38:48	00:38:50	Hamilton freaks out.
527	00:38:50	00:38:53	They fight and O'Neill ends up killing him.
528	00:38:53	00:38:56	Now O'Neill's a murderer-- under stress.
529	00:38:56	00:39:04	And a delusional stalker provides him with the perfect way to get Olivia out of Denny's life permanently.
530	00:39:04	00:39:06	It's reasonable.
531	00:39:06	00:39:08	But it's just speculation.
532	00:39:08	00:39:10	We can't nail O'Neill for either death.
533	00:39:10	00:39:21	The only reason O'Neill would risk stealing the body is if he believed it could somehow implicate him, which means there has to be evidence on the body or in the body.
534	00:39:58	00:40:00	Ugh.
535	00:40:00	00:40:02	Oh.
536	00:40:07	00:40:12	James Hamilton swallowed something when O'Neill beat him to death.
537	00:40:12	00:40:16	Greg found clothing fibers in his teeth.
538	00:40:18	00:40:20	We're looking for this cufflink.
539	00:40:23	00:40:26	If O'Neill knew what happened, why not take the body right then and there?
540	00:40:28	00:40:36	He didn't know, not until he came here and saw James Hamilton's body.
541	00:40:41	00:40:45	We've been separating metals and inorganics.
542	00:40:45	00:40:47	So... Here, this may be it.
543	00:41:00	00:41:03	We got him.
544	00:41:05	00:41:14	Las Vegas Police have arrested Tom O'Neill, a bodyguard often seen protecting the biggest celebrities, including Denny Ocampo.
545	00:41:14	00:41:17	Funny thing is, the father's death was probably an accident.
546	00:41:17	00:41:20	But Olivia was premeditated.
547	00:41:20	00:41:22	Irritates me that we weren't able to get him for that.
548	00:41:22	00:41:28	But you know what? We know what he did and so does he, and he can spend the next 20 years of his life dreaming of his perfect crime.
549	00:41:28	00:41:33	Think of it like busting Al Capone for tax evasion.
550	00:41:42	00:41:44	How did you now he was going to be hungry?
551	00:41:44	00:41:46	It doesn't really matter.
552	00:41:46	00:41:47	They go after crickets no matter what.
553	00:41:47	00:41:50	I think the chirping annoys them.
554	00:41:58	00:42:01	That's not my spider, dude.
555	00:42:01	00:42:03	Seriously?
556	00:42:03	00:42:05	Seriously.
557	00:42:05	00:42:07	Is that...?
558	00:42:07	00:42:09	Little Stevie?
559	00:42:09	00:42:12	Oh, he's been missing for years.
560	00:42:12	00:42:15	I'll have to let Sara know so she can tell her...
561	00:42:15	00:42:18	husband. Husband.
562	00:42:18	00:42:20	Hey, Nicky. Yeah.
563	00:42:20	00:42:22	You got a sec? Yeah.
564	00:42:25	00:42:27	What's up?
565	00:42:27	00:42:30	Oh, something that's long overdue.
566	00:42:30	00:42:36	I don't tell you enough, Nicky, but I couldn't do this job without you.
567	00:42:37	00:42:40	Okay.
568	00:42:40	00:42:42	Love you too, Catherine.
569	00:42:42	00:42:45	I am promoting you.
570	00:42:48	00:42:51	You are now assistant supervisor on grave.
571	00:42:51	00:42:54	All right. Thanks.
572	00:42:54	00:42:59	Please have these FI reviews on my desk by tomorrow night.
573	00:43:07	00:43:09	What's up, Doc?
574	00:43:09	00:43:13	Well, just business as usual, I'm delighted to say.
575	00:43:13	00:43:17	This gentleman has been in the cooler for a couple days.
576	00:43:17	00:43:18	Joseph Bigelow.
577	00:43:18	00:43:20	No known address.
578	00:43:20	00:43:22	Apparently, spent most of his time downtown in the streets.
579	00:43:23	00:43:25	No signs of trauma.
580	00:43:25	00:43:29	My guess is his ticker probably decided to call it quits.
581	00:43:30	00:43:33	Whoa.
582	00:43:39	00:43:42	What the hell is that?
583	00:43:42	00:43:44	I was hoping you'd tell me.
