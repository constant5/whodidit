0	0	00:00:17	00:00:19	I need one volunteer from the audience.	Y
1	1	00:00:26	00:00:27	You.	N
2	2	00:00:27	00:00:29	In the blue dress.	N
3	3	00:00:49	00:00:52	Step into the box.	N
4	4	00:00:52	00:00:54	Hands by your sides.	N
5	5	00:00:54	00:00:56	Don't move.	N
6	6	00:01:42	00:01:45	And ladies and gentleman I assure you she's quite all right.	Y
7	7	00:01:45	00:01:47	In fact, she's... Spotlight, please.	N
8	8	00:02:04	00:02:06	I don't know where she is.	N
9	9	00:02:09	00:02:11	Ladies and gentlemen...	N
10	10	00:02:13	00:02:15	I can't quite explain...	N
11	11	00:02:24	00:02:26	Welcome to the house of illusion.	N
12	12	00:02:26	00:02:27	This is bizarre.	N
13	13	00:02:27	00:02:29	You're not going to believe this.	N
14	14	00:02:29	00:02:35	Female volunteer goes on the stage, disappears and doesn't come back.	Y
15	15	00:02:35	00:02:37	Was she supposed to... reappear?	Y
16	16	00:02:37	00:02:41	The Amazing Zephyr won't say.	Y
17	17	00:02:41	00:02:46	You know magicians, they never reveal their tricks but we're working on him.	N
18	18	00:02:51	00:02:55	Well, I can understand why he doesn't want to reveal his trick...	N
19	19	00:02:57	00:03:01	but would he like to explain this blood?	N
20	20	00:03:35	00:03:38	I got a bunch of police officers, uh canvassing the theater right now.	N
21	21	00:03:38	00:03:42	No sign yet, but we have traced the woman back to her aisle seat, 8A.	N
22	22	00:03:42	00:03:44	Paid cash.	N
23	23	00:03:44	00:03:47	Magic is fun, Jim, but it's not real.	N
24	24	00:03:47	00:03:49	The woman is somewhere.	N
25	25	00:03:49	00:03:50	Thanks for that. Thanks.	N
26	26	00:03:50	00:03:51	Excuse me. Yeah?	N
27	27	00:03:51	00:03:53	Um, hi, are we finished here?	N
28	28	00:03:54	00:03:56	No. You were sitting in front of the volunteer, right?	N
29	29	00:03:56	00:03:58	You take any photos during the show?	N
30	30	00:03:58	00:04:00	We're going to need your camera.	N
31	31	00:04:00	00:04:01	But our whole trip's on there.	N
32	32	00:04:01	00:04:03	We'll get the negatives back to you. Michael.	N
33	33	00:04:03	00:04:04	Excuse me. Thanks for your help.	N
34	34	00:04:09	00:04:11	Dull as a spoon.	N
35	35	00:04:11	00:04:13	From a distance, it looks razor-sharp.	Y
36	36	00:04:13	00:04:14	That's the point.	Y
37	37	00:04:14	00:04:16	So is it real blood?	N
38	38	00:04:16	00:04:17	Well, let's see.	N
39	39	00:04:22	00:04:24	That's real blood, all right.	N
40	40	00:04:24	00:04:27	Nothing is as it seems, is it?	Y
41	41	00:04:28	00:04:34	That's the conflict of magic-- the burden of knowledge versus the mystique of wonder.	Y
42	42	00:04:34	00:04:42	And you're wondering right now-- I can hear your mind ticking-- Was she a plant? Was it real?	Y
43	43	00:04:42	00:04:43	Well, there are no secrets, are there?	Y
44	44	00:04:43	00:04:45	Only hidden answers.	Y
45	45	00:04:45	00:04:46	I'm an honest liar, sir.	Y
46	46	00:04:46	00:04:49	In my line of work it's accepted.	Y
47	47	00:04:49	00:04:51	You could say it was my livelihood.	N
48	48	00:04:51	00:04:55	Well, my livelihood is dispelling lies and finding the truth.	N
49	49	00:04:55	00:04:58	My secrets can't be revealed by any microscope.	Y
50	50	00:04:58	00:05:03	Yeah... but there's a woman missing.	Y
51	51	00:05:07	00:05:09	The only thing missing...	Y
52	52	00:05:13	00:05:14	...is this.	N
53	53	00:05:14	00:05:15	Very nice.	Y
54	54	00:05:16	00:05:18	So, where'd she go?	Y
55	55	00:05:18	00:05:19	From the salt in my marrow, I don't know.	Y
56	56	00:05:20	00:05:24	I mean, I can't give you this but I can give you... that.	Y
57	57	00:05:29	00:05:31	It's as real as my answer.	N
58	58	00:05:35	00:05:37	No, you can keep it.	N
59	59	00:05:41	00:05:42	What's the name of the band again?	N
60	60	00:05:42	00:05:46	Pekinpah. Back in '93, first album was a moderate hit.	N
61	61	00:05:46	00:05:51	Don't you remember that song, it was pretty popular-- uh... Symphony of Epiphanies?	N
62	62	00:05:59	00:06:01	Yeah, that was good to dance to.	N
63	63	00:06:01	00:06:04	He's been laying in the back of the bus for half an hour now.	N
64	64	00:06:04	00:06:06	I'm guessing that's the road manager.	N
65	65	00:06:06	00:06:08	He does not look too happy.	N
66	66	00:06:08	00:06:10	Well, he just lost a lead singer.	N
67	67	00:06:16	00:06:20	Ooh... rock and roll, baby.	N
68	68	00:06:26	00:06:27	Gus Kenyon.	N
69	69	00:06:27	00:06:29	It's a shame, man.	N
70	70	00:06:29	00:06:31	He had a good voice.	N
71	71	00:06:34	00:06:35	Heroin.	N
72	72	00:06:36	00:06:39	If this was an overdose, why leave some in the syringe?	N
73	73	00:06:39	00:06:41	No vomit around, either.	N
74	74	00:06:41	00:06:43	That's a first for me.	N
75	75	00:06:45	00:06:47	Wait a second, what's this?	N
76	76	00:06:47	00:06:50	Doesn't look like a bruise.	Y
77	77	00:06:50	00:06:51	How'd he do that?	N
78	78	00:06:51	00:06:53	What's that?	Y
79	79	00:06:53	00:06:54	The tourniquet.	Y
80	80	00:06:54	00:06:58	He's obviously left-handed if he shot up in the right arm.	N
81	81	00:06:58	00:07:03	If he tied it off himself he would have pulled it towards him, like so.	N
82	82	00:07:03	00:07:05	It's tied the other way, pulled away from him.	N
83	83	00:07:09	00:07:11	By someone else standing over him?	Y
84	84	00:07:16	00:07:19	Easy... if you're incapacitated.	N
85	85	00:07:19	00:07:20	You people seen enough?	N
86	86	00:07:20	00:07:22	When can I put him to rest?	N
87	87	00:07:22	00:07:24	You really shouldn't be in here, sir.	N
88	88	00:07:24	00:07:25	Hey, look, I'm sorry.	N
89	89	00:07:25	00:07:28	You know, this is a tragedy for all of us, and his family.	N
90	90	00:07:28	00:07:30	I just don't want the press to see him like this.	N
91	91	00:07:30	00:07:32	We understand that, sir, but this is a crime scene.	N
92	92	00:07:32	00:07:34	Crime scene?	N
93	93	00:07:34	00:07:35	It's an O.D., right?	N
94	94	00:07:35	00:07:37	He killed himself.	N
95	95	00:07:37	00:07:39	Then you knew he was a drug user?	N
96	96	00:07:39	00:07:40	Well, he was a drug user.	N
97	97	00:07:40	00:07:43	I mean, he's been clean for a long time.	N
98	98	00:07:43	00:07:45	A health freak, actually.	N
99	99	00:07:45	00:07:47	It's a shock to us all.	N
100	100	00:07:49	00:07:53	Big glass box and all I got is a partial thumb print.	Y
101	101	00:07:53	00:07:55	Is this processed yet?	N
102	102	00:07:55	00:07:58	Yeah. Want me to bag it for you?	N
103	103	00:07:58	00:07:59	Let's take it back to the lab.	N
104	104	00:07:59	00:08:01	Maybe we can make Greg disappear.	N
105	105	00:08:01	00:08:04	Who controls this stage, do we know?	N
106	106	00:08:04	00:08:05	I do.	N
107	107	00:08:08	00:08:09	And you are...?	N
108	108	00:08:09	00:08:11	Punky Dillinger. I'm Zephyr's stagehand.	N
109	109	00:08:11	00:08:14	Well, Mr. Dillinger do you know how this trick works?	N
110	110	00:08:14	00:08:17	I only control the stage part.	N
111	111	00:08:19	00:08:20	Yeah.	N
112	112	00:08:20	00:08:22	Good.	N
113	113	00:08:22	00:08:23	Make me disappear.	N
114	114	00:08:30	00:08:31	Bye-bye.	N
115	115	00:08:55	00:08:57	Oh, I get it.	N
116	116	00:08:59	00:09:02	There's a chute inside the steps.	N
117	117	00:09:03	00:09:05	Still here.	N
118	118	00:09:07	00:09:12	At this point of the trick I'm supposed to escort the volunteer out of the basement.	Y
119	119	00:09:12	00:09:14	Now I only turned my back for a second and she was gone.	N
120	120	00:09:14	00:09:16	Is there any other way out of here besides that door?	N
121	121	00:09:16	00:09:18	No, that's the thing. Stage left's the only exit.	N
122	122	00:09:18	00:09:20	I don't know.	N
123	123	00:09:22	00:09:23	You have any lights in here besides red?	N
124	124	00:09:23	00:09:25	We're looking for blood.	N
125	125	00:09:25	00:09:26	Mm-hmm.	N
126	126	00:09:29	00:09:31	Oh, hey? Hey?!	N
127	127	00:09:31	00:09:33	Those are Zephyr's tricks in the corner.	N
128	128	00:09:33	00:09:36	No one's allowed to go near them not even me.	N
129	129	00:09:43	00:09:48	I've got ovoid blood drops leading towards the wall.	N
130	130	00:09:48	00:09:49	You guys want more lights?	N
131	131	00:09:49	00:09:52	No. Turn them off.	N
132	132	00:10:20	00:10:25	Magicians of Zephyr's caliber belong to a very secluded society.	N
133	133	00:10:25	00:10:28	They barnstorm from city to city...	N
134	134	00:10:28	00:10:34	no contact with the outside world no association with other magicians.	N
135	135	00:10:34	00:10:37	They're like ghosts with skin.	N
136	136	00:10:41	00:10:46	This looks like an admixture of blood and some sort of clear liquid.	N
137	137	00:10:46	00:10:48	Someone bolted out of here pretty fast.	N
138	138	00:11:03	00:11:07	I'm no psychic, but I have been known to read palms.	N
139	139	00:11:07	00:11:08	Hey!	N
140	140	00:11:08	00:11:10	I got a print.	N
141	141	00:11:10	00:11:11	You're kidding me.	N
142	142	00:11:11	00:11:12	Nope.	N
143	143	00:11:12	00:11:14	No heroin in his system.	N
144	144	00:11:14	00:11:16	Lots of bourbon, but no heroin at all.	N
145	145	00:11:16	00:11:17	So what killed him?	N
146	146	00:11:17	00:11:18	Embolism to the heart.	N
147	147	00:11:18	00:11:20	Air bubble.	N
148	148	00:11:20	00:11:24	I withdrew air from his right ventricle and air can be deadlier the heroin.	N
149	149	00:11:25	00:11:32	It travels through the vein into the right ventricle to prevent blood from entering or leaving the chamber which eventually leads to heart failure.	N
150	150	00:11:32	00:11:34	Shock. Suffocation.	N
151	151	00:11:34	00:11:36	Explains why he didn't throw up.	N
152	152	00:11:36	00:11:39	And why his pupils weren't pinpoint.	Y
153	153	00:11:39	00:11:42	They would have been bilaterally small after an overdose.	N
154	154	00:11:42	00:11:43	There was heroin still in the needle.	N
155	155	00:11:43	00:11:45	Why didn't it make it into his system?	Y
156	156	00:11:45	00:11:47	His blood alcohol count was .31.	N
157	157	00:11:47	00:11:52	My guess is he was unconscious before his heart stopped.	N
158	158	00:11:52	00:11:54	Catherine, wait.	N
159	159	00:11:54	00:11:55	That black mark...	N
160	160	00:11:55	00:11:58	Oh, right, on his index finger.	N
161	161	00:11:58	00:11:59	Ink.	N
162	162	00:11:59	00:12:01	Standard black printing ink.	N
163	163	00:12:14	00:12:17	The stagehand was lying about another exit.	N
164	164	00:12:18	00:12:19	I got his palm print off the trap door.	N
165	165	00:12:19	00:12:21	Try this one.	N
166	166	00:12:21	00:12:23	It's a print from the Chamber of Doom.	N
167	167	00:12:38	00:12:39	Hands on the trap door?	N
168	168	00:12:39	00:12:41	Hands inside the trick?	N
169	169	00:12:41	00:12:44	There are no secrets.	N
170	170	00:12:46	00:12:47	Mmm. Hey, hey, hey.	N
171	171	00:12:47	00:12:50	This is a non-smoking facility.	N
172	172	00:13:14	00:13:17	I'm not a bad magician, you know.	N
173	173	00:13:17	00:13:19	When you find that, put that out.	N
174	174	00:13:20	00:13:22	Okay.	N
175	175	00:13:22	00:13:24	Truth is... I lied.	N
176	176	00:13:24	00:13:25	We know that.	N
177	177	00:13:25	00:13:27	That's why we're here.	N
178	178	00:13:27	00:13:31	I love magic, you know?	N
179	179	00:13:31	00:13:35	One of the fringe benefits of my job is knowing how the tricks work.	N
180	180	00:13:35	00:13:36	Zephyr wouldn't let anyone go near his tricks.	N
181	181	00:13:37	00:13:40	You think I want to be a stagehand the rest of my life?	N
182	182	00:13:40	00:13:42	I got aspirations, too, you know?	N
183	183	00:13:42	00:13:44	So, I snooped around.	N
184	184	00:13:44	00:13:47	Climbed inside the Chamber one night and tried it out.	N
185	185	00:13:47	00:13:49	Is that a crime?	N
186	186	00:13:49	00:13:52	We don't know yet.	N
187	187	00:13:52	00:13:56	The videotape from last night's show has you...	N
188	188	00:13:56	00:13:58	wearing this.	N
189	189	00:13:58	00:13:59	So what?	N
190	190	00:14:00	00:14:02	So, it was used as a tourniquet on Gus's arm.	N
191	191	00:14:04	00:14:07	Look, I-I was with these guys the entire night last night.	N
192	192	00:14:07	00:14:09	Okay.	N
193	193	00:14:10	00:14:12	When was the last time you saw him alive?	N
194	194	00:14:12	00:14:14	On the bus last night after the show.	N
195	195	00:14:14	00:14:17	He said he wanted to be left alone so we left him alone.	N
196	196	00:14:17	00:14:20	We finished the set with, uh City of Sin.	N
197	197	00:14:20	00:14:22	You know, the hometown pleaser.	N
198	198	00:14:22	00:14:24	He always hated that song.	N
199	199	00:14:24	00:14:25	I don't know why.	N
200	200	00:14:25	00:14:26	It was his best one.	N
201	201	00:14:26	00:14:30	I talked to your manager, and he said Gus was clean.	N
202	202	00:14:30	00:14:31	Yeah.	N
203	203	00:14:31	00:14:33	The whole band for six years now.	N
204	204	00:14:33	00:14:35	We-we did it together as a band.	N
205	205	00:14:35	00:14:37	You know, we kind of had to.	N
206	206	00:14:37	00:14:40	We went gold three months after we signed our first contract.	N
207	207	00:14:40	00:14:43	The next couple of years got pretty crazy.	N

209	209	00:14:45	00:14:49	Dude, hit single 24 years old.	N
210	210	00:14:49	00:14:50	Touring with Pearl Jam.	N
211	211	00:14:50	00:14:55	I mean Gus had bitches lining up outside of his room 24 hours a day.	N
212	212	00:14:55	00:14:57	Sleep ain't an option.	N
213	213	00:14:57	00:15:00	So, by your next gig, you're going you know, need a little bop.	N
214	214	00:15:00	00:15:04	I obtained Gus's medical records from L.A.	N
215	215	00:15:04	00:15:06	that said he was treated for depression.	N
216	216	00:15:07	00:15:08	You guys know anything about that?	N
217	217	00:15:09	00:15:12	Sober suits some better than others.	N
218	218	00:15:12	00:15:13	He could get pretty dark.	N
219	219	00:15:13	00:15:16	I mean, sometimes you couldn't even speak with him, you know?	N
220	220	00:15:16	00:15:19	He's been wanting out for some time now.	N
221	221	00:15:20	00:15:24	I know you didn't beep me for a magic trick.	N
222	222	00:15:25	00:15:27	Swami doesn't do magic tricks.	N
223	223	00:15:27	00:15:31	Swami's here to reveal all of your DNA secrets.	N
224	224	00:15:31	00:15:33	I'm very busy, Greg.	N
225	225	00:15:33	00:15:37	Blood from the Chamber of Doom.	Y
226	226	00:15:37	00:15:45	Same as the donor of the blood found on the basement floor but different than the blood found in the alleyway.	Y
227	227	00:15:45	00:15:46	Different person?	Y
228	228	00:15:46	00:15:48	Different...	N
229	229	00:15:48	00:15:49	animal.	N
230	230	00:15:49	00:15:51	Really?	N
231	231	00:15:51	00:15:52	What kind of animal?	N
232	232	00:15:52	00:15:55	Oh, Swami needs more time.	N
233	233	00:15:55	00:15:57	Now...	N
234	234	00:15:57	00:16:00	clear liquid found near the blood droplets.	N
235	235	00:16:02	00:16:07	It's not from Thora Birch, but...	N
236	236	00:16:07	00:16:09	Thorazine.	N
237	237	00:16:09	00:16:10	Thorazine.	N
238	238	00:16:10	00:16:12	Thorazine.	N
239	239	00:16:12	00:16:13	That's an animal tranquilizer.	N
240	240	00:16:13	00:16:15	Zephyr didn't use any live animals in his act.	N
241	241	00:16:15	00:16:18	Maybe he didn't use it on animals.	N
242	242	00:16:26	00:16:28	Whoa.	N
243	243	00:16:28	00:16:30	Go back one, Arch.	N
244	244	00:16:30	00:16:32	Is that her?	N
245	245	00:16:32	00:16:33	Blue dress, red hair.	N
246	246	00:16:35	00:16:36	Go on.	N
247	247	00:16:38	00:16:40	Is that who I think it is?	N
248	248	00:16:40	00:16:41	Who?	N
249	249	00:16:46	00:16:48	Toby Arcane.	N
250	250	00:16:48	00:16:49	Freak man.	N
251	251	00:16:49	00:16:52	What makes him a freak besides that shirt?	N
252	252	00:16:52	00:16:55	All I can say he's not for the faint of heart.	N
253	253	00:17:58	00:18:02	It's, uh, called The Cross-ifixion.	N
254	254	00:18:02	00:18:04	I get, uh, nailed to it every night.	N
255	255	00:18:04	00:18:06	Well, miraculously, you've resurrected.	N
256	256	00:18:07	00:18:09	Have you ever been to the Zephyr show?	N
257	257	00:18:09	00:18:11	He's a hack.	N
258	258	00:18:11	00:18:13	I wouldn't be caught dead at that show.	N
259	259	00:18:13	00:18:14	I know.	N
260	260	00:18:14	00:18:17	But we caught you alive.	Y
261	261	00:18:19	00:18:22	You should see my nudes, Grissom.	N
262	262	00:18:24	00:18:27	The, uh, woman who disappeared-- do you think she was a plant?	N
263	263	00:18:27	00:18:29	Of course she's a plant.	N
264	264	00:18:29	00:18:30	Zephyr's on life support.	N
265	265	00:18:30	00:18:34	His way of doing magic-- it's dead as, uh...	N
266	266	00:18:34	00:18:36	dead.	N
267	267	00:18:36	00:18:39	Fooling people from a hundred feet away.	N
268	268	00:18:42	00:18:44	'Cause I'm in your face.	N
269	269	00:18:45	00:18:47	Right here.	N
270	270	00:18:48	00:18:57	We have reason to believe that that woman, planted or not sustained injury during the first insertion of the saber.	N
271	271	00:18:57	00:19:00	Do you think it was part of the act or do you think it was some kind of mistake?	N
272	272	00:19:00	00:19:06	Uh, yeah, could have been a blood pouch but knowing him...	N
273	273	00:19:06	00:19:07	it was a mistake.	N
274	274	00:19:07	00:19:11	Is it possible that he put his saber into the wrong slot?	N
275	275	00:19:11	00:19:14	Well this is Vegas, baby.	N
276	276	00:19:14	00:19:16	The band's last two albums, and the DVD.	N
277	277	00:19:16	00:19:17	You know, I heard that they were splitting up.	N
278	278	00:19:17	00:19:19	Where did you hear that?	N
279	279	00:19:19	00:19:21	Uh, the New World Library-- Internet.	N
280	280	00:19:21	00:19:24	This contains, uh, TV appearances live footage, things like that.	N
281	281	00:19:24	00:19:25	He wrote every song.	N
282	282	00:19:25	00:19:26	Who, the singer, Gus?	N
283	283	00:19:26	00:19:27	His name's on every title.	N
284	284	00:19:27	00:19:31	If they were splitting up and he took his songs back no more Pekinpah, no more money for the band.	N
285	285	00:19:32	00:19:34	Why don't you get back on the Internet for us?	N
286	286	00:19:34	00:19:36	See if there's any gossip floating around.	N
287	287	00:19:36	00:19:39	We need to get back to the crime scene.	Y
288	288	00:19:39	00:19:40	I'm looking for ink.	Y
289	289	00:20:05	00:20:07	I showed the road manager a copy of the warrant.	N
290	290	00:20:07	00:20:08	He went nuts.	N
291	291	00:20:08	00:20:10	He's on the phone with his lawyer right now.	N
292	292	00:20:10	00:20:13	Why do they want us off this bus so badly?	N
293	293	00:20:32	00:20:35	Standard printing ink.	N
294	294	00:20:43	00:20:47	What to do when your cell phone's not working.	Y
295	295	00:20:58	00:21:00	Empty.	N
296	296	00:21:05	00:21:06	This doesn't work.	N
297	297	00:21:06	00:21:09	Seems like nothing on that bus does.	N
298	298	00:21:09	00:21:12	Yeah, but this doesn't work, 'cause the batteries suck.	N
299	299	00:21:13	00:21:15	Oh.	N
300	300	00:21:15	00:21:16	Belongs to the guitarist.	N
301	301	00:21:16	00:21:18	Looks like Mr. Clean and Sober had a habit.	N
302	302	00:21:18	00:21:21	Bet it matches that smack we found on the needle.	N
303	303	00:21:21	00:21:24	Yeah. You, uh, trying to make a call?	N
304	304	00:21:24	00:21:25	No...	N
305	305	00:21:25	00:21:26	but somebody did.	N
306	306	00:21:33	00:21:36	Got a smudged name.	N
307	307	00:21:36	00:21:38	Dean.	N
308	308	00:21:44	00:21:45	Goodyear Wrangler.	N
309	309	00:21:45	00:21:47	Ford F-150.	N
310	310	00:21:47	00:21:49	Hallelujah.	N
311	311	00:21:50	00:21:52	Did a DNA profile on your blood.	N
312	312	00:21:52	00:21:53	Ran it through CODIS.	N
313	313	00:21:53	00:21:54	Guess who I found?	N
314	314	00:21:54	00:21:55	Who?	N
315	315	00:21:55	00:21:56	Zoe Clein.	N
316	316	00:21:56	00:21:57	White Caucasian.	N
317	317	00:21:57	00:21:58	Female.	N
318	318	00:21:58	00:21:59	Red hair.	N
319	319	00:21:59	00:22:01	Wait a minute.	N
320	320	00:22:01	00:22:02	CODIS? What database?	N
321	321	00:22:02	00:22:03	Missing persons.	N
322	322	00:22:03	00:22:04	She's in the database already?	N
323	323	00:22:04	00:22:06	Yeah. She's been in there for six months.	N
324	324	00:22:06	00:22:08	Same time she's been missing.	N
325	325	00:22:08	00:22:09	Brass is working on an address.	N
326	326	00:22:13	00:22:14	Nice house.	N
327	327	00:22:16	00:22:18	Built it so close to the railroad.	N
328	328	00:22:20	00:22:23	I bet this house was here first.	N
329	329	00:22:36	00:22:39	Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
330	330	00:22:39	00:22:42	It's a little too calm.	N
331	331	00:22:42	00:22:43	Yeah.	N
332	332	00:22:43	00:22:47	I'll take upstairs.	N
333	333	00:23:11	00:23:12	Wow.	N
334	334	00:23:12	00:23:13	What?	N
335	335	00:23:13	00:23:15	Six pints of A positive.	N
336	336	00:23:52	00:23:54	Hey, guys?	N
337	337	00:23:56	00:23:58	Zoe's bedroom seems intact.	N
338	338	00:23:58	00:24:00	Suitcases, purses, clothes.	N
339	339	00:24:00	00:24:01	It looks like she never left.	N
340	340	00:24:07	00:24:09	Guys?	N
341	341	00:24:41	00:24:42	( screams) Sorry.	N
342	342	00:24:42	00:24:44	You keep disappearing.	N
343	343	00:24:46	00:24:49	Take a look at this.	N
344	344	00:24:49	00:24:51	Huh. Looks like the Chamber of Doom.	N
345	345	00:24:51	00:24:53	Designed by Zoe Clein.	N
346	346	00:24:53	00:24:56	So, she's an inventor.	N
347	347	00:25:06	00:25:09	Hey, guys, check out this old photo.	N
348	348	00:25:09	00:25:11	The Clein Magical Tour.	N
349	349	00:25:15	00:25:16	The one with beard must be the father.	N
350	350	00:25:17	00:25:19	Zoe Clein the daughter.	N
351	351	00:25:19	00:25:20	Young Zephyr...	N
352	352	00:25:22	00:25:23	What's he doing there?	N
353	353	00:25:23	00:25:26	And who's that baby in his arms?	N
354	354	00:25:27	00:25:28	What up, G?	N
355	355	00:25:29	00:25:30	Well, I did my snooping around.	N
356	356	00:25:30	00:25:33	Obviously everyone's upset about Kenyon croaking.	N
357	357	00:25:33	00:25:34	And?	N
358	358	00:25:34	00:25:36	And they were planning a Best of... album.	N
359	359	00:25:36	00:25:37	No surprise.	N
360	360	00:25:37	00:25:39	Cash cow, everybody does it.	N
361	361	00:25:39	00:25:43	Well, someone e-mailed me a clip of Gus on MTV2 a few months ago.	N
362	362	00:25:45	00:25:48	Compilation albums are for has-beens.	N
363	363	00:25:48	00:25:51	They can release one over my dead body.	N
364	364	00:25:52	00:25:55	As long as I'm alive, I'm going to continue to write originals.	N
365	365	00:25:55	00:25:57	Who's planning the album?	N
366	366	00:25:57	00:25:58	Keith Castle.	N
367	367	00:25:59	00:26:00	The guitarist?	N
368	368	00:26:00	00:26:01	Mm-hmm.	N
369	369	00:26:01	00:26:02	I'm chasing the smack.	N
370	370	00:26:02	00:26:04	I'm chasing the phone book.	N
371	371	00:26:26	00:26:27	Warrick, come here.	N
372	372	00:26:30	00:26:32	What is that, a butterfly?	N
373	373	00:26:32	00:26:33	A male Io moth.	N
374	374	00:26:33	00:26:35	One of the largest in North America.	N
375	375	00:26:35	00:26:36	How'd it get in here?	N
376	376	00:26:36	00:26:38	I don't know. It feeds on trees and foliage.	N
377	377	00:26:38	00:26:39	There's none of that in here.	N
378	378	00:26:39	00:26:42	See the eye-like spots on the back of its wings?	Y
379	379	00:26:42	00:26:44	It's an illusion to confuse predators.	N
380	380	00:26:44	00:26:47	Birds get fooled into thinking it's an owl.	N
381	381	00:26:47	00:26:50	I have a similar one in my office.	N
382	382	00:26:55	00:26:58	Didn't we release Officer Henderson?	N
383	383	00:27:06	00:27:08	Hello?	N
384	384	00:27:18	00:27:20	Hello?	N
385	385	00:27:46	00:27:46	Hold up! Back up!	Y
386	386	00:27:47	00:27:47	I really didn't...	N
387	387	00:27:47	00:27:48	Warrick!	N
388	388	00:27:48	00:27:49	Hey! Back up.	Y
389	389	00:27:54	00:27:56	Look, I got a family, okay?	Y
390	390	00:27:56	00:27:57	They think I'm clean.	Y
391	391	00:27:57	00:27:59	The band, too.	Y
392	392	00:27:59	00:28:00	Did you give some to Gus last night?	N
393	393	00:28:02	00:28:03	Needle, too?	N
394	394	00:28:03	00:28:04	No, no, no, man.	N
395	395	00:28:04	00:28:06	I don't shoot up.	Y
396	396	00:28:06	00:28:07	That's just for snorting.	Y
397	397	00:28:08	00:28:09	Well, Keith...	Y
398	398	00:28:09	00:28:14	think Gus would get messed up enough to kill himself?	Y
399	399	00:28:14	00:28:17	That'd help you sell a few more albums, wouldn't it?	Y
400	400	00:28:17	00:28:18	Gus is dead, okay?	N
401	401	00:28:18	00:28:22	You never had the pleasure of finding out what an ass he was in person.	N
402	402	00:28:22	00:28:26	Yeah, we made some money off his talent but he made us feel worthless.	N
403	403	00:28:26	00:28:30	At least when he was high he'd shut up.	Y
404	404	00:28:55	00:28:56	Samantha Dean?	N
405	405	00:28:56	00:28:58	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
406	406	00:28:58	00:29:00	Do you know Gus Kenyon?	N
407	407	00:29:00	00:29:07	Gus Kenyon looked up your number and address in this directory and, uh, called you last night...	Y
408	408	00:29:07	00:29:10	from a phone booth outside of his tour bus.	Y
409	409	00:29:10	00:29:14	00 a.m.	N
410	410	00:29:14	00:29:16	I must have been asleep.	N
411	411	00:29:16	00:29:19	It lasted 20 seconds.	N
412	412	00:29:19	00:29:20	I didn't answer.	N
413	413	00:29:20	00:29:21	So it rang?	N
414	414	00:29:21	00:29:23	No, I mean, I can't remember.	N
415	415	00:29:23	00:29:25	00.	Y
416	416	00:29:27	00:29:28	What's your son's name?	N
417	417	00:29:28	00:29:29	Brandon.	N
418	418	00:29:29	00:29:30	You a mother?	N
419	419	00:29:30	00:29:35	Yeah, yeah, I have a, a daughter who is nine.	Y
420	420	00:29:35	00:29:38	Yeah, I know how hard it is to do it alone.	N
421	421	00:29:38	00:29:43	Now those are some cool shades Brandon has on.	Y
422	422	00:29:43	00:29:45	Are those Silhouettes? Those are expensive.	N
423	423	00:29:45	00:29:50	Um, do you have any more question because, uh, Brandon needs to go to my mother's.	Y
424	424	00:29:50	00:29:51	I have to go to work.	Y
425	425	00:29:51	00:29:53	All right. Thanks for your time.	N
426	426	00:30:19	00:30:22	How long have you been working for the Zephyr?	N
427	427	00:30:22	00:30:23	A year.	N
428	428	00:30:23	00:30:26	The magician I used to assist for retired.	N
429	429	00:30:26	00:30:28	What are you doing here?	N
430	430	00:30:28	00:30:34	I came to talk to Zoe, and the door was open so I thought I'd snoop around a little.	N
431	431	00:30:34	00:30:36	A lot of people are snooping around these days.	N
432	432	00:30:36	00:30:41	You know, everybody who works for the Zephyr wants to be a magician. How come?	N
433	433	00:30:41	00:30:43	'Cause we do everything.	N
434	434	00:30:43	00:30:46	I mean, what does he do? Wave his arms around?	N
435	435	00:30:46	00:30:49	I work my butt off for that guy.	N
436	436	00:30:49	00:30:53	Bring this out, bring that out keep proper timing, inspect the tricks.	N
437	437	00:30:53	00:30:55	You know, follow his lead.	N
438	438	00:30:55	00:30:59	Zoe is the best inventor in the business.	N
439	439	00:30:59	00:31:03	You know, she sells me just one of her tricks and I can be in business myself.	N
440	440	00:31:03	00:31:05	So you know Zoe Clein.	N
441	441	00:31:05	00:31:06	Through Zephyr. Yeah.	N
442	442	00:31:06	00:31:10	Was she a plant the night she disappeared?	Y
443	443	00:31:10	00:31:11	Yeah.	Y
444	444	00:31:11	00:31:16	It's one of her stipulations that she's the volunteer opening night.	Y
445	445	00:31:16	00:31:18	Zoe Clein has been missing for six months.	N
446	446	00:31:18	00:31:20	And you saw her the night she...	Y
447	447	00:31:20	00:31:22	disappeared.	Y
448	448	00:31:25	00:31:26	How do you explain that?	N
449	449	00:31:27	00:31:29	I don't know.	Y
450	450	00:31:30	00:31:32	By the way how'd you get here?	N
451	451	00:31:32	00:31:33	Drove.	N
452	452	00:31:33	00:31:35	My car's parked down the street.	N
453	453	00:31:35	00:31:36	What kind of car do you drive?	N
454	454	00:31:36	00:31:38	A Ford F-150.	N
455	455	00:31:38	00:31:40	Ford F-150.	N
456	456	00:31:50	00:31:52	It's a match.	N
457	457	00:31:56	00:31:57	Whoa.	N
458	458	00:31:57	00:31:59	Well, at least we know the animal.	N
459	459	00:32:00	00:32:01	Black panther.	N
460	460	00:32:01	00:32:04	Dispatch, this is P-4981.	Y
461	461	00:32:04	00:32:07	We need animal control at, uh...	Y
462	462	00:32:07	00:32:09	Oh, my God.	N
463	463	00:32:12	00:32:13	Thorazine.	N
464	464	00:32:13	00:32:14	What did they do?	N
465	465	00:32:14	00:32:17	Drug her and feed her to the panther?	N
466	466	00:32:23	00:32:24	There.	N
467	467	00:32:24	00:32:26	What?	N
468	468	00:32:26	00:32:28	There.	N
469	469	00:32:28	00:32:29	Where?	N
470	470	00:32:29	00:32:31	Samantha Dean.	N
471	471	00:32:31	00:32:33	She knows him. She's backstage with him.	N
472	472	00:32:33	00:32:34	So?	N
473	473	00:32:34	00:32:35	Backstage with a rock star.	N
474	474	00:32:35	00:32:37	Trust me, it's a big deal.	N
475	475	00:32:37	00:32:39	See that VIP pass around her neck?	N
476	476	00:32:39	00:32:40	That's like diamonds. Really?	N
477	477	00:32:40	00:32:42	Hmm.	Y
478	478	00:32:42	00:32:43	So...	Y
479	479	00:32:43	00:32:44	groupie?	Y
480	480	00:32:44	00:32:46	Girlfriend?	Y
481	481	00:33:04	00:33:08	There was a scuff on Samantha Dean's door.	Y
482	482	00:33:08	00:33:10	Was it a red door?	N
483	483	00:33:15	00:33:16	Kick ass.	N
484	484	00:33:19	00:33:20	Sadie's my cat.	N
485	485	00:33:20	00:33:22	She's my pet.	N
486	486	00:33:22	00:33:23	I got her from a previous gig.	N
487	487	00:33:23	00:33:26	Zephyr hates animals so I just keep her in my truck during the show.	N
488	488	00:33:26	00:33:30	I let her out between shows so she can get some air and she cut her leg on the tailgate.	N
489	489	00:33:30	00:33:31	So I sedated her.	N
490	490	00:33:36	00:33:37	Can I go?	N
491	491	00:33:37	00:33:39	I've got a lot of work to do.	N
492	492	00:33:39	00:33:40	Tonight's a really big night.	N
493	493	00:33:40	00:33:43	We're sold out for the first time and Zephyr's debuting a new trick.	N
494	494	00:33:43	00:33:45	Really? New trick.	N
495	495	00:33:58	00:34:03	Ladies and gentlemen I know you all want to disappear.	N
496	496	00:34:05	00:34:11	But tonight, there'll be no sabers no surprises and no volunteers.	N
497	497	00:34:14	00:34:18	Tonight I will attempt to make myself disappear.	N
498	498	00:35:07	00:35:08	It's been rigged.	N
499	499	00:35:08	00:35:09	With a metal stake.	N
500	500	00:35:15	00:35:17	Someone just got nailed to the cross.	N
501	501	00:35:17	00:35:22	He's got external burns covering approximately 80% of his body.	N
502	502	00:35:22	00:35:25	Majority are second- and third-degree.	N
503	503	00:35:25	00:35:27	Extensive damage to his hands.	N
504	504	00:35:27	00:35:29	Curled and closed.	N
505	505	00:35:29	00:35:31	The human body protecting its prints.	N
506	506	00:35:31	00:35:35	You're going to have a tough time finding anything substantial here.	N
507	507	00:35:35	00:35:37	Better run his dental records, then, huh?	N
508	508	00:35:37	00:35:38	Yeah, sure.	N
509	509	00:35:38	00:35:39	COD?	N
510	510	00:35:39	00:35:40	Laryngeal spasm.	N
511	511	00:35:40	00:35:42	We usually see this in drownings.	N
512	512	00:35:42	00:35:45	Only instead of swallowing water, he swallowed fire.	N
513	513	00:35:47	00:35:57	It causes the larynx to pinch shut protecting itself, yet cutting off his air supply and that leads to immediate unconsciousness and death.	Y
514	514	00:35:57	00:36:00	Another example of the body trying to protect itself.	N
515	515	00:36:00	00:36:03	And, uh, I'd say in this case, it didn't work.	N
516	516	00:36:03	00:36:04	Unusual, though.	N
517	517	00:36:04	00:36:08	Not as unusual as what I found in his mouth.	N
518	518	00:36:08	00:36:13	Surgically created soft tissue pouches within the gingivae.	N
519	519	00:36:13	00:36:16	It's like pockets of skin.	N
520	520	00:36:16	00:36:17	In the lining.	N
521	521	00:36:17	00:36:18	I've never seen this before.	N
522	522	00:36:18	00:36:19	Neither have I.	N
523	523	00:36:19	00:36:26	I knew that Houdini could swallow and regurgitate keys on cue but I've never heard of skin pockets.	Y
524	524	00:36:26	00:36:28	Learn something new every day don't you?	Y
525	525	00:36:50	00:36:51	Come on, trust me.	N
526	526	00:36:52	00:36:53	Okay.	Y
527	527	00:36:53	00:36:55	It's fun.	Y
528	528	00:37:09	00:37:20	This, uh collapsible stake right here breaks a tiny little blood capsule inside giving the illusion that I'm bleeding.	Y
529	529	00:37:20	00:37:24	Look it doesn't suit me to kill Zephyr.	Y
530	530	00:37:24	00:37:27	See, I've been killing him for years.	Y
531	531	00:37:28	00:37:30	Come on, people, this is magic.	Y
532	532	00:37:30	00:37:31	( metal rattling) It's B.S.	Y
533	533	00:37:31	00:37:33	It's all fake.	Y
534	534	00:37:33	00:37:34	Look at this.	Y
535	535	00:37:34	00:37:38	Even this tattoo.	Y
536	536	00:37:39	00:37:43	I'm from Orange County, dude.	Y
537	537	00:37:43	00:37:44	Thanks for your time.	N
538	538	00:37:46	00:37:48	On earth.	Y
539	539	00:37:48	00:37:51	You're welcome.	N
540	540	00:37:51	00:37:53	This is ridiculous.	Y
541	541	00:37:53	00:37:55	I don't even own a stereo.	Y
542	542	00:37:55	00:37:57	So, you never met Gus Kenyon?	N
543	543	00:37:57	00:37:58	No.	N
544	544	00:37:58	00:37:59	You sure?	N
545	545	00:37:59	00:38:00	We know he was here.	Y
546	546	00:38:00	00:38:04	We matched the paint from your door to the pain on Gus's ring.	Y
547	547	00:38:05	00:38:11	And it's not so much that this girl in the photograph looks exactly like you.	Y
548	548	00:38:11	00:38:16	It's that, the sunglasses that Gus is wearing... familiar?	Y
549	549	00:38:16	00:38:19	Of course not.	Y
550	550	00:38:19	00:38:24	Very rare, custom-made graduated lenses.	Y
551	551	00:38:24	00:38:27	Your son is holding them in his hands.	N
552	552	00:38:30	00:38:32	Were they a gift to him?	N
553	553	00:38:33	00:38:36	No.	N
554	554	00:38:36	00:38:38	He has his father's eyes.	N
555	555	00:38:38	00:38:42	The two of you met on a video shoot in Vegas six years ago.	Y
556	556	00:38:42	00:38:44	Last night...	N
557	557	00:38:44	00:38:45	Hey, baby.	N
558	558	00:38:45	00:38:46	...alone and depressed...	N
559	559	00:38:46	00:38:47	I tried to call you.	N
560	560	00:38:47	00:38:49	...he just decided to look you up.	N
561	561	00:38:49	00:38:50	Who's that? Huh?	N
562	562	00:38:50	00:38:52	He knew immediately that it was his son.	Y
563	563	00:38:52	00:38:54	Any father would.	Y
564	564	00:38:54	00:38:57	For some reason you had kept Brandon a secret.	N
565	565	00:38:57	00:38:59	Why didn't you tell me?	Y
566	566	00:38:59	00:39:00	Please, just leave!	Y
567	567	00:39:00	00:39:01	Just go! Please!	N
568	568	00:39:01	00:39:02	Gus gets angry.	N
569	569	00:39:03	00:39:05	He can't understand why you won't let him be a parent.	N
570	570	00:39:05	00:39:07	( banging on door) Honey, it's okay.	Y
571	571	00:39:07	00:39:10	You've changed a lot since your days with Gus.	Y
572	572	00:39:10	00:39:15	You were protecting your son from his father's lifestyle.	Y
573	573	00:39:15	00:39:18	Miss Dean, you're a registered nurse, is that correct?	N
574	574	00:39:18	00:39:22	That means you have access to medical supplies.	Y
575	575	00:39:23	00:39:24	Needles?	Y
576	576	00:39:25	00:39:28	Gus left here and he went back on the bus.	Y
577	577	00:39:28	00:39:32	He thought about doing some of Mr. Castle's drugs but he didn't.	Y
578	578	00:39:32	00:39:33	He said he just passed out from the booze.	N
579	579	00:39:33	00:39:37	But you, you've been around heroin before, haven't you?	N
580	580	00:39:37	00:39:40	You know how to cook it.	Y
581	581	00:39:40	00:39:46	Did you think you put just enough in the syringe to make it look like a suicide?	N
582	582	00:39:46	00:39:48	Am I under arrest?	N
583	583	00:39:49	00:39:50	No.	N
584	584	00:39:50	00:39:52	No, we're just here for your son's DNA.	N
585	585	00:39:53	00:39:56	Then I think I should hire a lawyer.	N
586	586	00:39:57	00:39:59	I just have one other thing, Miss Dean.	Y
587	587	00:40:00	00:40:10	I'm just guessing that when you found out you were pregnant that you stopped listening to Gus's band and that you haven't heard any of his latest songs.	Y
588	588	00:40:10	00:40:26	I'm drying up like rain and sand Without you wiping away my tears with your hand You saw through the lies That make up my disguise I need you back to set me free Just give me one last chance Come back to me.	N
589	589	00:40:27	00:40:28	I think that he wrote this for you.	N
590	590	00:40:28	00:40:34	I think that he loved you very much and... that he missed you.	N
591	591	00:40:40	00:40:50	When I made him leave he said he'd call an L.A. lawyer and take Brandon away from me.	Y
592	592	00:40:50	00:41:00	I'm not sure now what I was going to do but... when I saw him with the heroin next to him...	Y
593	593	00:41:00	00:41:03	I knew nothing had changed.	Y
594	594	00:41:04	00:41:07	I carry needles in my kit.	Y
595	595	00:41:07	00:41:09	Took a tourniquet from the dresser.	Y
596	596	00:41:09	00:41:12	Injected him with air multiple times.	Y
597	597	00:41:15	00:41:21	I am not proud of my youth and my son was never going to be a part of that world.	N
598	598	00:41:23	00:41:24	You're a mother.	N
599	599	00:41:24	00:41:29	What would you be willing to do to save the life of your child?	N
600	600	00:41:31	00:41:38	I think that I'd rather have my daughter know a bad father than no father at all.	N
601	601	00:42:19	00:42:21	Warrick.	N
602	602	00:42:21	00:42:24	I need you to find out everything you can about Zephyr and his crew.	N
603	603	00:42:24	00:42:25	Sara, check Web sites.	N
604	604	00:42:25	00:42:26	Concentrate on Punky.	N
605	605	00:42:26	00:42:27	I've got a hunch about these guys.	N
606	606	00:42:27	00:42:28	Where are you going?	N
607	607	00:42:28	00:42:30	Coroner.	N
608	608	00:42:30	00:42:32	I need a piece of the Zephyr.	N
609	609	00:42:45	00:42:51	Zephyr Dillinger and Punky the stagehand.	N
610	610	00:42:51	00:42:53	They're related?	N
611	611	00:42:53	00:42:55	Father and son?	N
612	612	00:42:55	00:42:57	Magician and his double.	N
613	613	00:43:27	00:43:28	He fooled us.	N
614	614	00:43:28	00:43:30	It was Punky burning in that box.	N
615	615	00:43:30	00:43:32	Zephyr murdered his son.	N
616	616	00:43:32	00:43:34	The little boy from the picture.	N
617	617	00:43:35	00:43:37	They pulled a switch.	Y
618	618	00:43:39	00:43:41	See this coin?	Y
619	619	00:43:41	00:43:42	It's two-headed.	N
620	620	00:43:42	00:43:43	Two heads as one.	N
621	621	00:43:43	00:43:45	One and the same.	N
622	622	00:43:45	00:43:50	Zephyr and his son are interchangeable in physical appearance like the Io moth.	Y
623	623	00:43:50	00:43:52	You know what that mean?	N
624	624	00:43:52	00:43:55	Zephyr's still out there.	Y
625	625	00:43:55	00:43:58	So, if you're a master of deception where do you hide?	Y
626	626	00:43:58	00:44:01	Or do you?	N
627	627	00:44:51	00:44:54	I think this room is shrinking.	N
628	628	00:45:28	00:45:31	Nothing is what it seems.	Y
629	629	00:45:31	00:45:34	But I fooled them all.	Y
630	630	00:45:34	00:45:36	Even that ungrateful masochist.	N
631	631	00:45:36	00:45:39	You, in the blue dress.	Y
632	632	00:45:39	00:45:40	Who's he kidding?	Y
633	633	00:45:40	00:45:41	That's a plant.	Y
634	634	00:45:43	00:45:44	That was a plant.	N
635	635	00:45:44	00:45:51	It-It's amazing what you can do with a stagehand and a masquerade mask.	N
636	636	00:45:51	00:45:55	You know, not to mention a prop like a packet full of Zoe's blood.	Y
637	637	00:45:58	00:46:03	You know, lucky for me she let me have some before she mysteriously disappeared.	Y
638	638	00:46:03	00:46:05	You made her disappear.	N
639	639	00:46:06	00:46:09	No, I assumed her.	N
640	640	00:46:19	00:46:20	Quick-change artistry.	N
641	641	00:46:20	00:46:22	A magical transformation.	N
642	642	00:46:22	00:46:24	With a good seamstress and some Velcro...	Y
643	643	00:46:24	00:46:29	We know that you switched with your son, Punky to set up Toby Arcane for your murder.	Y
644	644	00:46:29	00:46:31	That trick didn't work so well, did it?	Y
645	645	00:46:31	00:46:34	Not as planned.	N
646	646	00:46:34	00:46:37	And your finding me here has thwarted my transmutation.	N
647	647	00:46:37	00:46:39	Abracadabra.	N
648	648	00:46:39	00:46:41	Abracadabra.	N
649	649	00:46:41	00:46:48	That's a cabalistic charm said to be made up from three Hebrew words meaning, father, son and the holy spirit.	N
650	650	00:46:48	00:46:52	You're the father who took his son's life...	N
651	651	00:46:52	00:46:57	so that you could disappear and become the holy spirit?	N
652	652	00:46:57	00:46:58	No.	N
653	653	00:46:59	00:47:02	From caterpillar to cocoon.	N
654	654	00:47:03	00:47:06	From cocoon to moth.	N
655	655	00:47:07	00:47:09	And from moth...	N
656	656	00:47:12	00:47:13	...to dust.	N
657	657	00:47:18	00:47:22	Your son aspired to be a great magician, didn't he?	N
658	658	00:47:22	00:47:24	Yeah, but he served better as a prop.	N
659	659	00:47:24	00:47:27	You're about to be arrested for his murder.	N
660	660	00:47:27	00:47:29	You don't want to know how I did that trick?	N
661	661	00:47:29	00:47:30	No.	N
662	662	00:47:30	00:47:33	Magicians shouldn't reveal their tricks.	N
663	663	00:47:33	00:47:37	And they say they save their best trick for last.	N
664	664	00:47:40	00:47:43	Officer?	N
665	665	00:47:45	00:47:46	Officer, wait a minute.	N
666	666	00:47:46	00:47:49	Turn him around, please.	N
667	667	00:47:51	00:47:52	Open your mouth, please.	N
668	668	00:48:03	00:48:05	Satisfied?	N
669	669	00:48:05	00:48:07	Yeah.	N
