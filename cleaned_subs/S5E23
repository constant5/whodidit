0	00:00:48	00:00:49	Freshman dorm, coed.
1	00:00:49	00:00:55	Two DB's on the third floor-- Trip Wilmont and Paula Levine. Both 18.
2	00:00:55	00:00:58	Hey, Grissom, when you went to college did you live in the dorms?
3	00:00:58	00:01:00	Surely, you jest.
4	00:01:00	00:01:04	You know, they say a BA is worth a million dollars in extra income over a lifetime.
5	00:01:04	00:01:08	Yeah, but the present cost of college tuition is about the same amount.
6	00:01:08	00:01:10	So you're saying college isn't worth the expense?
7	00:01:10	00:01:12	I guess it depends on what you learn.
8	00:01:12	00:01:14	So this is Trip's dorm room.
9	00:01:14	00:01:17	When he missed a big B-ball game this afternoon, his coach called his R.A.
10	00:01:17	00:01:20	His R.A. got the kid next door to jimmy the lock.
11	00:01:20	00:01:22	Paramedics pronounced and took off.
12	00:01:22	00:01:23	The coroner's en route.
13	00:01:36	00:01:39	Music, alcohol, candles.
14	00:01:39	00:01:41	Kid was a regular Romeo.
15	00:01:42	00:01:49	For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo Condom wrapper.
16	00:01:52	00:01:55	So much for safe sex.
17	00:02:29	00:02:32	Sara, do me a favor and open the window, please.
18	00:02:32	00:02:33	Sure.
19	00:02:35	00:02:37	You feeling okay, David?
20	00:02:37	00:02:39	Yeah.
21	00:02:39	00:02:42	Take a look at the skin coloration on both victims.
22	00:02:42	00:02:44	Their bodies are slightly pink.
23	00:02:44	00:02:50	And you're thinking pink skin tones are a common effect of carbon monoxide fumes.
24	00:02:50	00:02:54	That vomit's also consistent with exposure to C.O.
25	00:02:54	00:02:55	We'll need a sample of that vomit.
26	00:02:58	00:03:00	Grissom.
27	00:03:01	00:03:02	Okay, I'll be right there.
28	00:03:04	00:03:06	My testimony's up in the Hoyt case.
29	00:03:06	00:03:07	I gotta go.
30	00:03:07	00:03:11	I see no common source for C.O., so you'll have to use the detector.
31	00:03:11	00:03:13	You're running point.
32	00:03:14	00:03:15	I knew something was wrong.
33	00:03:16	00:03:20	Trip lived for basketball, and it was the semis, so there's no way he'd miss a game.
34	00:03:20	00:03:25	Yeah, I saw Susan banging on his door, so I used my pocketknife to jam it open.
35	00:03:25	00:03:27	Had you done that before? Yeah. All the time.
36	00:03:27	00:03:31	Whenever Trip would get drunk and lock himself out, he would bang on my door.
37	00:03:31	00:03:32	So you and Trip were friends?
38	00:03:32	00:03:34	Me and Trip? Mm-hmm.
39	00:03:34	00:03:36	No. I'm not really the type of guy that Trip Wilmont would hang out with.
40	00:03:36	00:03:39	So I guess that's a no?
41	00:03:39	00:03:40	Yeah. But we had Spanish 102 together.
42	00:03:40	00:03:43	Sometimes he'd roll over to my dorm, and I'd help him with his homework.
43	00:03:43	00:03:45	Did you help him, or did you do it for him?
44	00:03:45	00:03:48	Look, it's not the Spanish Inquisition.
45	00:03:48	00:03:51	For a jock, it could have been a lot worse but, no, we weren't friends.
46	00:03:51	00:03:52	Okay.
47	00:04:08	00:04:09	No trace of carbon monoxide.
48	00:04:12	00:04:16	There's a trace of semen on the door handle.
49	00:04:23	00:04:25	This one, too.
50	00:04:27	00:04:29	Trophy condoms.
51	00:04:29	00:04:30	Trophy condoms?
52	00:04:30	00:04:35	When a stud scores, he announces his victory by putting his spoils on his neighbor's doorknob.
53	00:04:35	00:04:39	Oh. Well, my bet is Trip scored a lot.
54	00:04:43	00:04:45	Everyone okay?
55	00:04:51	00:04:53	Excuse me.
56	00:05:05	00:05:09	Spontaneous toilet combustion?
57	00:05:09	00:05:12	Or a college prank.
58	00:05:12	00:05:14	You think this has anything to do with the case?
59	00:05:14	00:05:17	20 feet away from two dead kids.
60	00:05:17	00:05:19	We got to check it out.
61	00:05:19	00:05:22	Guess you should, uh... start processing.
62	00:05:38	00:05:39	Conrad.
63	00:05:39	00:05:40	Hey, Detective.
64	00:05:41	00:05:42	Homicide called you guys over an hour ago.
65	00:05:42	00:05:43	419 at the Tangiers.
66	00:05:43	00:05:45	No one's responded. Not even the coroner.
67	00:05:46	00:05:47	Have you tried Grissom or Catherine?
68	00:05:47	00:05:49	Catherine's on a case, I think. Grissom...
69	00:05:49	00:05:51	Oh, that's right. Grissom's in court.
70	00:05:51	00:05:53	Oh. And Sofia's still on her Task Force leave.
71	00:05:53	00:05:54	Both shifts are tapped.
72	00:05:54	00:05:55	Did you check...? I checked the board.
73	00:05:55	00:05:58	No one's available...
74	00:05:58	00:06:00	except for you.
75	00:06:02	00:06:05	I'm the Assistant Lab Director.
76	00:06:05	00:06:08	I know. But you're still qualified to process a scene, right?
77	00:06:09	00:06:10	Yes, I am.
78	00:06:11	00:06:14	I'll dust off my kit.
79	00:06:14	00:06:16	Meet you there.
80	00:06:19	00:06:21	Hey, Doc.
81	00:06:21	00:06:22	Two dead bodies.
82	00:06:22	00:06:24	Both were in perfect health.
83	00:06:24	00:06:27	I am so hoping that you have more in your report than that.
84	00:06:27	00:06:30	There are two toxins which can turn a body pink postmortem.
85	00:06:30	00:06:32	We already ruled out carbon monoxide.
86	00:06:32	00:06:34	Which leaves one-- cyanide ingestion.
87	00:06:34	00:06:37	Interesting fact about cyanide-- not everyone can smell it.
88	00:06:37	00:06:39	Right. It's a genetic quirk.
89	00:06:39	00:06:41	Unfortunately, I don't have that ability.
90	00:06:42	00:06:45	The Nose has arrived.
91	00:06:45	00:06:47	Hodges has the genetic quirk?
92	00:06:47	00:06:51	It's a blessing and a curse.
93	00:06:51	00:06:55	Stomach contents of both decedents.
94	00:06:55	00:06:57	Hodges, start your sniffer.
95	00:07:08	00:07:11	Hints of stale beer and...
96	00:07:11	00:07:13	Cheese Whiz.
97	00:07:13	00:07:15	But I don't smell any cyanide.
98	00:07:15	00:07:16	Thank you.
99	00:07:16	00:07:18	Anytime.
100	00:07:19	00:07:25	Well, all due respect to The Nose, I would still like to send a sample of blood to Tox.
101	00:07:25	00:07:26	It's already done.
102	00:07:26	00:07:28	Is there anything else?
103	00:07:28	00:07:31	Nothing on or in the body indicates cause of death.
104	00:07:31	00:07:34	Nothing consistent with homicide whatsoever.
105	00:07:34	00:07:37	Two college kids die under mysterious circumstances.
106	00:07:37	00:07:40	Let's treat this as a homicide till we know otherwise.
107	00:07:43	00:07:45	Finally.
108	00:07:46	00:07:48	Yeah, well three hours.
109	00:07:48	00:07:49	All right. Thanks.
110	00:07:53	00:07:55	Crime scene's getting cold.
111	00:07:55	00:07:57	Had to refill my powders.
112	00:07:59	00:08:02	I found a rental car agreement in the glove box.
113	00:08:02	00:08:05	James Billmeyer. New Jersey.
114	00:08:05	00:08:06	He's not registered at the hotel.
115	00:08:06	00:08:09	Probably stopped by to lose a few bucks.
116	00:08:09	00:08:11	Did the coroner step in the blood?
117	00:08:11	00:08:13	No. We're still waiting on him.
118	00:08:13	00:08:15	That shoe print belongs to Mrs. Vivoldi.
119	00:08:15	00:08:16	She called it in.
120	00:08:16	00:08:18	We been waiting on you to take her statement.
121	00:08:18	00:08:19	Let's do it.
122	00:08:19	00:08:21	Yes, let's do it.
123	00:08:22	00:08:25	Thanks.
124	00:08:25	00:08:26	Ma'am, sorry to keep you waiting.
125	00:08:26	00:08:27	I'm Detective Vartann.
126	00:08:27	00:08:29	This is Conrad Ecklie from the crime lab.
127	00:08:29	00:08:31	Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
128	00:08:31	00:08:33	I'd mind if you didn't.
129	00:08:33	00:08:35	I am the one who found the body.
130	00:08:35	00:08:39	Yes. At the time, were you walking to or from the hotel?
131	00:08:39	00:08:41	I'd had just finished lunch with the girls.
132	00:08:42	00:08:44	We say girls, but we're, you know, women.
133	00:08:44	00:08:47	I don't find being called a girl derogatory.
134	00:08:47	00:08:49	That's good. To or from?
135	00:08:49	00:08:52	I was walking to the car. The SUV?
136	00:08:52	00:08:53	A gift from Oscar.
137	00:08:53	00:08:55	30 years with the same man.
138	00:08:55	00:08:57	Congratulations.
139	00:08:57	00:08:58	Thank you. Are you married?
140	00:08:58	00:09:00	Divorced.
141	00:09:00	00:09:02	Oh. And you?
142	00:09:02	00:09:06	Uh... ma'am, so you were walking to your car...
143	00:09:06	00:09:11	Walking to the car, and I think I stepped into gum or something...
144	00:09:16	00:09:19	That's when I called 911.
145	00:09:19	00:09:21	Which was about, um...
146	00:09:21	00:09:23	two hours ago.
147	00:09:23	00:09:24	I'm sorry, ma'am.
148	00:09:24	00:09:26	We've been very busy.
149	00:09:26	00:09:29	I'm going to need your shoes.
150	00:09:29	00:09:30	We'll get them back to you.
151	00:09:30	00:09:32	Even wash off the blood.
152	00:09:32	00:09:38	I just talked to Paula yesterday afternoon.
153	00:09:38	00:09:42	She was on her way to the library.
154	00:09:42	00:09:46	She had a biology final this morning.
155	00:09:46	00:09:48	She shouldn't have been in a boy's room.
156	00:09:48	00:09:50	None of this makes any sense.
157	00:09:50	00:09:52	Trip was a serious athlete.
158	00:09:52	00:09:56	He would never sleep around the night before...
159	00:09:56	00:09:57	Sleep around?
160	00:09:57	00:10:00	It's not like your daughter was Trip's girlfriend.
161	00:10:00	00:10:02	Ms. Sidle...
162	00:10:02	00:10:04	I need to know.
163	00:10:04	00:10:05	Did Trip take advantage...?
164	00:10:06	00:10:08	Did he force himself on Paula?
165	00:10:08	00:10:10	My son would never force himself on anyone.
166	00:10:10	00:10:13	Trip could have any girl he wanted.
167	00:10:13	00:10:16	Mrs. Levine, the coroner found no evidence of assault.
168	00:10:17	00:10:21	Did Paula ever mention Trip to you?
169	00:10:23	00:10:24	No.
170	00:10:24	00:10:28	I know she liked a boy on the basketball team.
171	00:10:28	00:10:30	I never knew his name.
172	00:10:30	00:10:31	I guess it was Trip.
173	00:10:33	00:10:37	I just want to know what happened to them.
174	00:10:39	00:10:41	So do I.
175	00:10:52	00:10:54	This land used to be part of the Bennett estate.
176	00:10:54	00:10:57	Bill Bennett? Guy who owns the Sahara?
177	00:10:57	00:10:58	Yeah. Huh.
178	00:10:58	00:11:02	We used to come out here when we were in high school.
179	00:11:02	00:11:06	Used to be, like, a seven-acre lover's lane.
180	00:11:06	00:11:07	I thought you said you were a dork in high school.
181	00:11:07	00:11:09	I was a dork in high school.
182	00:11:09	00:11:11	I'm still a dork, but I had dimples.
183	00:11:11	00:11:12	I got a little action.
184	00:11:12	00:11:14	I don't doubt that. Hey, Dave.
185	00:11:14	00:11:16	Oh, hello.
186	00:11:17	00:11:19	The path to the body was made by the paramedics.
187	00:11:19	00:11:22	They pronounced and took off.
188	00:11:22	00:11:25	ID'ed has Kevin Staniland, age 30 from Reno.
189	00:11:25	00:11:30	I figured before I processed the body, you'd want to photograph the crop circle.
190	00:11:30	00:11:31	Crop circle?
191	00:11:31	00:11:34	Well, it's a circle in the middle of a field.
192	00:11:34	00:11:35	What would you call it?
193	00:11:35	00:11:37	I guess it's a crop circle.
194	00:11:40	00:11:41	The guy has a blindfold on.
195	00:11:41	00:11:43	Pin the tail on the donkey gone wrong?
196	00:11:47	00:11:50	Lividity is fixed.
197	00:11:50	00:11:51	Lividity's fixed?
198	00:11:51	00:11:53	So this wasn't a body dump?
199	00:11:53	00:11:54	He died there?
200	00:11:54	00:11:56	The only pathway is from the paramedics.
201	00:11:56	00:11:58	How'd he end up in the middle of the circle?
202	00:11:58	00:12:00	I have an idea.
203	00:12:02	00:12:04	I'll keep it to myself.
204	00:12:16	00:12:19	Hey. How's it going?
205	00:12:19	00:12:22	I swabbed every square inch of this toilet.
206	00:12:22	00:12:27	So far, no evidence of explosive powders or a detonation device.
207	00:12:27	00:12:28	Well, I spoke with maintenance.
208	00:12:28	00:12:30	It is an isolated incident.
209	00:12:30	00:12:32	There are no other reports of exploding johns.
210	00:12:32	00:12:34	How about methane gas?
211	00:12:34	00:12:36	Maybe there's a natural reserve under the dorm.
212	00:12:36	00:12:40	Theoretically, pressure could have built up, broken a sewer pipe and shot up through the toilet.
213	00:12:41	00:12:42	Yeah.
214	00:12:42	00:12:43	I already checked.
215	00:12:43	00:12:46	There's no methane gas in this region of Clare County.
216	00:12:47	00:12:49	Well, there's got to be some logical explanation.
217	00:12:49	00:12:54	Well, if dorm food is as bad as I can remember, we should consider explosive diarrhea.
218	00:13:02	00:13:04	Crop circles?
219	00:13:06	00:13:07	Come on, Super Dave.
220	00:13:07	00:13:10	Wasn't the Alien Autopsy embarrassing enough?
221	00:13:10	00:13:13	Given the circumstances, alien was not an unreasonable conclusion at the time.
222	00:13:14	00:13:15	You need to get a girlfriend.
223	00:13:15	00:13:19	I'm engaged, but thank you.
224	00:13:19	00:13:19	Could you just check out his pants?
225	00:13:19	00:13:22	There's grass stains on his knees.
226	00:13:22	00:13:25	That's odd, because the grass around the victim was undisturbed.
227	00:13:25	00:13:27	His tighty whiteys were soaked in urine.
228	00:13:27	00:13:29	Don't know if it's pre- or postmortem.
229	00:13:31	00:13:32	Oh!
230	00:13:32	00:13:33	Now, that's alien.
231	00:13:34	00:13:35	What is that?
232	00:13:35	00:13:36	I've got to document this.
233	00:13:37	00:13:38	Oh, hang on.
234	00:13:38	00:13:40	We have ourselves a tapeworm, gentlemen.
235	00:13:42	00:13:48	This guy's been eating meat or fish infected with tapeworm cyst.
236	00:13:52	00:13:59	Yeah, that cyst grows up to be nice fat tapeworm that attaches itself to the intestinal wall and suck out all your nutrients.
237	00:13:59	00:14:04	Yeah, and since this guy's already dead, the tapeworm needs to find a new host.
238	00:14:05	00:14:05	Only two ways out.
239	00:14:06	00:14:07	I'm glad it picked the mouth.
240	00:14:08	00:14:12	Well, the tapeworm could have made the guy sick, but it didn't kill him.
241	00:14:14	00:14:15	Hello.
242	00:14:15	00:14:17	Hey. Want to talk about semen?
243	00:14:17	00:14:18	Okay. Okey-doke.
244	00:14:18	00:14:24	The semen on the vic's doorknob and the neighbor's doorknob is consistent with Trip's DNA.
245	00:14:24	00:14:34	So, what I'm thinking is that Trip put a trophy condom onto his neighbor's door and then transferred a trace of his reproductive material back onto his own doorknob.
246	00:14:40	00:14:42	You've, uh, you've heard of trophy condoms?
247	00:14:42	00:14:44	Sara, I went to college.
248	00:14:46	00:14:50	Ladies, I just spoke with Western LVU's Student Affairs Officer.
249	00:14:50	00:14:55	Apparently, Trip's next-door neighbor, Zack Capola filed several grievances against him.
250	00:14:55	00:14:57	I'm headed over there now.
251	00:14:57	00:14:58	I'll drive.
252	00:14:58	00:15:00	You always do.
253	00:15:00	00:15:04	So, crop circles and tapeworms, you got quite a case.
254	00:15:04	00:15:05	Mm.
255	00:15:05	00:15:06	You have C.O.D.?
256	00:15:06	00:15:09	I have T.O.D., about midday yesterday.
257	00:15:09	00:15:11	Cause of death is less definitive.
258	00:15:11	00:15:14	Cuts and abrasions are superficial.
259	00:15:14	00:15:17	There's no obvious anatomical defect.
260	00:15:17	00:15:23	And at this point, I'm going to have to check the default-- cardiac arrhythmia.
261	00:15:23	00:15:26	A young man's heart stops, and you don't know why?
262	00:15:26	00:15:29	Tox and vitreous lytes are all normal.
263	00:15:29	00:15:31	That's all you're getting from me.
264	00:15:32	00:15:34	This is bunk.
265	00:15:34	00:15:36	I was told my grievances were confidential.
266	00:15:36	00:15:38	They said my name wasn't even on the form.
267	00:15:38	00:15:40	Why was confidentiality so important?
268	00:15:40	00:15:41	Ask him.
269	00:15:41	00:15:43	You look like you were a jock in college.
270	00:15:43	00:15:45	Me? Him?
271	00:15:45	00:15:47	Whatever.
272	00:15:47	00:15:51	Look, if it had gotten around that I had ratted out Trip, the whole basketball team would have come down on me.
273	00:15:51	00:15:53	You are a straight-A student.
274	00:15:53	00:15:55	We've reviewed your academic records.
275	00:15:55	00:15:58	The distractions must've pissed you off.
276	00:15:58	00:16:04	You had problems with his loud music, banging on the wall, used condoms hanging on your doorknob.
277	00:16:04	00:16:06	A handful of used condoms would have pissed you off, too.
278	00:16:06	00:16:07	Look, what are you getting at?
279	00:16:07	00:16:09	We're trying to figure out what happened to Trip and Paula.
280	00:16:09	00:16:12	Earlier you said he wasn't such a bad guy.
281	00:16:12	00:16:15	Because I didn't see a need to badmouth the dead.
282	00:16:15	00:16:17	But you want the truth, he was an ass, okay?
283	00:16:31	00:16:33	Well, Conrad, can I help you?
284	00:16:33	00:16:35	Where have you been?
285	00:16:35	00:16:37	I posted three bodies and then I took a time-out.
286	00:16:37	00:16:40	A time-out?
287	00:16:40	00:16:41	A personal hour.
288	00:16:41	00:16:43	A few weeks ago, my Siamese had kittens.
289	00:16:44	00:16:46	I went by the house to check on 'em.
290	00:16:46	00:16:47	They're just about weaned.
291	00:16:47	00:16:48	You want one?
292	00:16:48	00:16:51	I'm allergic.
293	00:16:51	00:16:53	So tell me about James Billmeyer.
294	00:16:53	00:16:55	Guy found at the Tangiers.
295	00:16:55	00:16:56	I'm just about to post him.
296	00:16:56	00:17:04	Per my prelim, there was an abraded laceration to the right occipital scalp, and a penetration of the epithelium, but not the galea.
297	00:17:04	00:17:08	It's not what killed him, but I'll know the full story once I open him up.
298	00:17:11	00:17:13	I saw David put him in here.
299	00:17:13	00:17:15	So where is he?
300	00:17:15	00:17:17	I'm not sure.
301	00:17:17	00:17:18	Maybe he's taking a time-out.
302	00:17:21	00:17:22	David probably moved him.
303	00:17:22	00:17:23	He had no reason to.
304	00:17:26	00:17:30	A few years back, a body was prematurely sent to a mortician.
305	00:17:30	00:17:31	Remember that?
306	00:17:35	00:17:37	This is weird.
307	00:17:37	00:17:40	Maybe someone in your department mislabeled the corpse?
308	00:17:40	00:17:42	It's highly unlikely.
309	00:17:42	00:17:44	Fine. When you find him, get back to me.
310	00:18:21	00:18:22	Sir?
311	00:18:22	00:18:24	We have a situation.
312	00:18:24	00:18:25	I know. A body disappeared.
313	00:18:25	00:18:26	No, no.
314	00:18:26	00:18:28	Mr. Billmeyer didn't disappear.
315	00:18:28	00:18:30	He's missing. There's a difference.
316	00:18:30	00:18:31	Sir, this isn't my fault.
317	00:18:31	00:18:32	You prepped him for autopsy, right?
318	00:18:32	00:18:33	Yes, sir.
319	00:18:33	00:18:34	Walk me through that.
320	00:18:34	00:18:35	Walk you through what?
321	00:18:35	00:18:38	Everything you did to Mr. Billmeyer.
322	00:18:39	00:18:53	Okay, um, I brought him into the washroom, photographed the body, took hair and fingernail cuttings, emptied his pockets, removed clothing, washed his body, tagged him.
323	00:18:53	00:18:58	I put him into the cooler and I haven't seen him since.
324	00:19:02	00:19:03	What?
325	00:19:03	00:19:04	I was just thinking, David.
326	00:19:04	00:19:06	I've lost my keys, sunglasses, even a wallet.
327	00:19:06	00:19:08	Sir, this really isn't my fault.
328	00:19:08	00:19:09	But I've never lost a body.
329	00:19:09	00:19:11	I didn't do anything. Find him, Phillips, or this goes on your record.
330	00:19:11	00:19:12	What would you like me to do?
331	00:19:12	00:19:14	Get out! Get out.
332	00:19:14	00:19:15	Out!
333	00:19:15	00:19:16	I don...
334	00:19:17	00:19:22	Six-one, brown hair and eyes, about 200 pounds.
335	00:19:22	00:19:24	Are you sure?
336	00:19:24	00:19:25	All right, thanks.
337	00:19:27	00:19:30	I've checked every mortuary and funeral home in the city, no luck.
338	00:19:31	00:19:32	Right, 'cause you never authorized a transfer.
339	00:19:32	00:19:36	David, are you familiar with the Latin word necrostuprum?
340	00:19:36	00:19:39	Body snatcher?
341	00:19:39	00:19:41	We didn't mislabel or misplace the body.
342	00:19:41	00:19:42	Someone took it.
343	00:19:42	00:19:47	If you wanted to steal a body, wouldn't it be a lot easier to go to a hospital or university facility?
344	00:19:47	00:19:51	Absolutely, which means somebody wanted this particular body.
345	00:19:51	00:20:00	Some of the leading theories on crop circles include extraterrestrials, wind vortexes, Earth energies, and of course, hoaxes.
346	00:20:00	00:20:08	But in 1985, farmers near one U.S. military base suspected the source of a recent incident to be the downwash from a helicopter's rotor blades.
347	00:20:08	00:20:13	The spinning of the blades caused the chopper to rise forced the air downward, in effect, bending the grass below.
348	00:20:13	00:20:16	For every action, there is an opposite but equal reaction.
349	00:20:16	00:20:20	Since I'm a skeptic when it comes to aliens and Earth energies, ooh.
350	00:20:20	00:20:22	So we started with the chopper.
351	00:20:23	00:20:24	Hey, Archie.
352	00:20:24	00:20:25	Oh, hey.
353	00:20:25	00:20:28	Nellis sent over the radar surveillance.
354	00:20:28	00:20:30	Current feed goes back 48 hours.
355	00:20:30	00:20:31	This is where your decedent was located.
356	00:20:31	00:20:36	00 noon, yesterday.
357	00:20:38	00:20:42	Using echo and Doppler shift we can determine an object's speed.
358	00:20:43	00:20:45	Freeze the frame, Archie.
359	00:20:46	00:20:47	Found your chopper.
360	00:20:47	00:20:50	It's holding steady. Airplanes can't do that.
361	00:20:50	00:20:51	Let's see who owns it.
362	00:20:58	00:21:01	Hey, I got your 911.
363	00:21:01	00:21:03	Don't you work days?
364	00:21:03	00:21:05	Ecklie keeps moving me around.
365	00:21:05	00:21:08	Your pink college kids were both blotto.
366	00:21:08	00:21:10	Yeah, there were beer bottles at the scene.
367	00:21:10	00:21:11	That's not a surprise.
368	00:21:11	00:21:12	You want a surprise? Check this out.
369	00:21:12	00:21:17	Now, I know you and Greg tested the scene for carbon monoxide, but did you check for carbon dioxide?
370	00:21:17	00:21:19	No.
371	00:21:19	00:21:21	I've been a CSI eight years.
372	00:21:21	00:21:24	I have never processed a C02 scene.
373	00:21:24	00:21:27	I mean, you'd need a ton of that gas to cause serious damage.
374	00:21:27	00:21:29	It's a first for me, too.
375	00:21:29	00:21:32	I found traces of blood in Trip's vomit.
376	00:21:32	00:21:34	C02 levels are usually .03%.
377	00:21:34	00:21:35	His levels were 8%. Lethal.
378	00:21:35	00:21:41	C02 replaces oxygen on hemoglobin molecules.
379	00:21:41	00:21:45	At 8%, those kids would've literally suffocated on a cellular level.
380	00:21:45	00:21:47	Still doesn't explain why they were pretty in pink.
381	00:21:47	00:21:51	Carbon dioxide, unlike carbon monoxide, doesn't affect skin coloration.
382	00:21:51	00:21:52	So what did?
383	00:21:54	00:21:56	What are we expecting to find here?
384	00:21:56	00:21:59	Someone went to a lot of trouble to steal James Billmeyer...
385	00:21:59	00:22:02	Maybe there's a clue in his personal effects.
386	00:22:02	00:22:04	So you're a CSI now?
387	00:22:04	00:22:08	If I were, I would have printed the cooler.
388	00:22:08	00:22:10	Really?
389	00:22:11	00:22:15	Maybe you should just put together a list of everyone who had access to the morgue.
390	00:22:15	00:22:23	Law enforcement personnel, CSIs, paramedics, funeral home personnel, maintenance workers, hospital workers, janitors...
391	00:22:23	00:22:24	people that get lost in the building...
392	00:22:25	00:22:26	Yeah, that sounds good.
393	00:22:26	00:22:31	Two pairs of socks, two pairs of underwear, two T-shirts. That tells me the guy was going to be staying in Vegas for two days.
394	00:22:31	00:22:34	Your powers of deduction are remarkable, Detective.
395	00:22:34	00:22:37	Thank you.
396	00:22:39	00:22:42	Jacinda Hendler, call me.
397	00:22:42	00:22:43	Written on an airline napkin.
398	00:22:44	00:22:46	Decedent probably met her on the flight, possibly hours before he died.
399	00:22:46	00:22:47	You think?
400	00:22:50	00:22:52	I'll run it down.
401	00:22:53	00:22:55	Yeah, I know Jamie.
402	00:22:55	00:22:56	He's a sweet man.
403	00:22:56	00:22:58	He was supposed to call me.
404	00:22:58	00:23:00	What happened to him?
405	00:23:00	00:23:01	He died.
406	00:23:01	00:23:02	Oh, I'm sorry.
407	00:23:02	00:23:04	Why'd you contact me?
408	00:23:04	00:23:05	Well, your name was in his pocket.
409	00:23:06	00:23:08	Napkin.
410	00:23:08	00:23:10	We, uh, we met on the plane.
411	00:23:11	00:23:14	And, uh, there was only one blanket, so we...
412	00:23:14	00:23:17	shared it, and I got a little frisky, and...
413	00:23:17	00:23:20	Anyway, there was a kid sitting two seats away, so...
414	00:23:20	00:23:22	So you gave him your number...
415	00:23:23	00:23:24	...to meet up later?
416	00:23:24	00:23:26	Yeah.
417	00:23:26	00:23:28	Do you have any idea who may've killed him?
418	00:23:28	00:23:33	Or who might want his body in its current condition? No.
419	00:23:33	00:23:38	Jamie told me that he-he was flying in to party with some pals from high school in Seven Hills.
420	00:23:38	00:23:40	Said he'd invite me over.
421	00:23:40	00:23:41	Figured he blew me off.
422	00:23:41	00:23:43	It-it happens.
423	00:23:43	00:23:44	I mean...
424	00:23:44	00:23:46	I have a healthy self-esteem.
425	00:23:46	00:23:48	Good for you.
426	00:23:48	00:23:50	Yes.
427	00:23:54	00:23:57	Thanks.
428	00:24:01	00:24:03	What exactly are we looking for?
429	00:24:03	00:24:07	Most sources of carbon dioxide come from...
430	00:24:07	00:24:13	factories, cars and volcanoes, not something we're gonna find in a dorm room.
431	00:24:13	00:24:15	Maybe somebody pumped the gas in through a vent.
432	00:24:16	00:24:18	Uh, sex journal.
433	00:24:18	00:24:20	Lists of girls...
434	00:24:20	00:24:22	dates...
435	00:24:22	00:24:24	and sexual activities.
436	00:24:24	00:24:26	Boys and their conquests.
437	00:24:26	00:24:29	I've never even heard of some of these.
438	00:24:29	00:24:30	Really?
439	00:24:30	00:24:31	Never mind.
440	00:24:32	00:24:34	Would you help me move the bed, please?
441	00:24:40	00:24:42	There's a fresh hole in the wall.
442	00:24:42	00:24:44	Splinters are on the inside.
443	00:24:45	00:24:47	Someone drilled in from the other side.
444	00:24:47	00:24:49	( knock on door ) Hey.
445	00:24:49	00:24:50	Hi, Zack.
446	00:24:50	00:24:52	Mind if we come in? Why?
447	00:24:56	00:24:59	Ah, you're a car buff, huh?
448	00:24:59	00:25:00	I guess. Yeah, me, too.
449	00:25:01	00:25:02	I always wanted a Testarossa.
450	00:25:02	00:25:04	What about you, what's your dream car?
451	00:25:04	00:25:06	Uh, I don't know.
452	00:25:07	00:25:10	Zack, can you explain this hole in your wall?
453	00:25:10	00:25:11	I didn't even know there was one.
454	00:25:15	00:25:18	I think maybe we should step outside.
455	00:25:18	00:25:20	Your room is now a crime scene.
456	00:25:42	00:25:43	Are you Morgan Wendel? Yeah.
457	00:25:43	00:25:45	We're from the Crime Lab.
458	00:25:45	00:25:49	We have information that put your chopper at a crime scene yesterday, around noon.
459	00:25:49	00:25:50	You're here about Kevin.
460	00:25:50	00:25:52	That's right, yeah.
461	00:25:52	00:25:55	I'll tell you everything, but I want immunity.
462	00:25:55	00:25:57	All right, Kevin!
463	00:25:57	00:26:00	Yeah! Whoo! I want you to prepare to jump!
464	00:26:00	00:26:02	Without a parachute?
465	00:26:02	00:26:03	That's my stunt?!
466	00:26:03	00:26:07	No way! Dude, the name of the show is Going All the Way.
467	00:26:07	00:26:09	You signed a contract. Now, do it!
468	00:26:09	00:26:14	Jumping out of chopper's not going all the way-- it's suicide! Listen, man, you don't have a choice, Kevin.
469	00:26:14	00:26:17	You already ate raw meat, you stuck your face in a beehive.
470	00:26:17	00:26:19	You don't go all the way, you don't get nothing!
471	00:26:19	00:26:20	Come on, Kevin! No!
472	00:26:20	00:26:21	( laughs ) What are you doing?!
473	00:26:21	00:26:23	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
474	00:26:23	00:26:24	Dude, dude, check this out, get a shot of this.
475	00:26:24	00:26:26	Get his crotch. Get his crotch.
476	00:26:26	00:26:27	Come here. ( grunting )
477	00:26:27	00:26:31	Our first contestant peed his pants.
478	00:26:31	00:26:33	Re-a-li-ty! Come on, let go!
479	00:26:33	00:26:35	You can't fake this. Now, Kevin...
480	00:26:35	00:26:36	Go, baby! ( yells )
481	00:26:40	00:26:41	Keep going, keep going.
482	00:26:42	00:26:43	But here's the thing.
483	00:26:43	00:26:45	We're only four feet up.
484	00:26:45	00:26:46	Joke's on him.
485	00:26:46	00:26:47	Let's check it out.
486	00:26:47	00:26:50	Kevin! Kevin!
487	00:26:51	00:26:53	He's not moving.
488	00:26:53	00:26:55	Turn off the camera. Turn off the camera! Turn...
489	00:26:55	00:26:59	Kevin thought that he was being pushed out of a helicopter a thousand feet in the air, but...
490	00:26:59	00:27:02	See you later, Kevin! ( yells )
491	00:27:02	00:27:04	Hey, Kevin?
492	00:27:04	00:27:06	He's not moving.
493	00:27:09	00:27:11	Come on, let's get out of here!
494	00:27:13	00:27:15	Did you have a warrant for that tape?
495	00:27:15	00:27:19	The pilot gave us the name of the cameraman, who supplied the tape voluntarily.
496	00:27:19	00:27:21	Look, I assured Kevin all our stunts were safe.
497	00:27:21	00:27:23	And they were.
498	00:27:23	00:27:25	Besides, he signed a waiver; I'm not guilty of anything.
499	00:27:25	00:27:29	When you saw that he wasn't moving, you just took off.
500	00:27:29	00:27:31	That sounds like guilt to me.
501	00:27:31	00:27:33	You scared him to death.
502	00:27:33	00:27:34	He had a heart attack.
503	00:27:34	00:27:38	So the signing of a waiver doesn't make it any less criminal.
504	00:27:38	00:27:42	When the jury sees that tape, you'll be going all the way...
505	00:27:42	00:27:44	to jail.
506	00:27:44	00:27:45	Second-degree murder.
507	00:27:45	00:27:49	25 to life.
508	00:27:55	00:27:57	I hope this is a fire drill. Conrad.
509	00:27:57	00:27:59	We found our body.
510	00:27:59	00:28:02	Looks more like he found us.
511	00:28:10	00:28:12	Doc, I want you to process the body ASAP.
512	00:28:12	00:28:15	Yeah, Conrad, I'll get right on it.
513	00:28:15	00:28:18	Ah, yes-- the guy we left on the bench.
514	00:28:18	00:28:19	Right.
515	00:28:21	00:28:23	Hello, Conrad.
516	00:28:23	00:28:27	I thought you were in court. We had a one-hour recess-- I'm on my way back now.
517	00:28:27	00:28:29	And this must be Mr. Billmeyer.
518	00:28:29	00:28:31	I'm so glad he's back.
519	00:28:31	00:28:33	Very funny.
520	00:28:33	00:28:35	You might want to have Hodges analyze that cigar.
521	00:28:35	00:28:37	Oh, and the print tech is free.
522	00:28:37	00:28:41	He could, uh, spray the party hat with ninhydrin.
523	00:28:41	00:28:45	I think I remember how to do my job, Gil, thank you.
524	00:28:46	00:28:48	I love it when you wear your gloves.
525	00:28:55	00:28:58	I swear, I don't know how that hole got there.
526	00:28:58	00:29:02	And if you think that I had anything to do with Trip's death, you're wrong.
527	00:29:02	00:29:04	I was in L.A. for four days.
528	00:29:04	00:29:07	I had just gotten back, and I saw Susan banging on his door.
529	00:29:09	00:29:10	Trip, are you in there? Open up.
530	00:29:10	00:29:13	If you can hear me, open the door. Please?
531	00:29:13	00:29:14	Hey, are you all right?
532	00:29:14	00:29:17	Yeah, Trip missed a game. I thought something's wrong.
533	00:29:17	00:29:18	Trip?
534	00:29:18	00:29:21	Hey, man, we're coming in.
535	00:29:21	00:29:24	Can anyone verify that you were in L.A.?
536	00:29:24	00:29:26	The whole dorm can verify it.
537	00:29:27	00:29:30	I was visiting my boyfriend. It was his birthday.
538	00:29:30	00:29:34	We went to the auto show. Does anyone else have access to your room?
539	00:29:34	00:29:38	No, I've got the only key, but like I said, it's easy enough to break in.
540	00:29:38	00:29:40	What happened to your finger?
541	00:29:40	00:29:42	I'm not sure.
542	00:29:42	00:29:46	I had just gotten back from my trip, and I saw something on the floor, so I picked it up.
543	00:29:46	00:29:48	It kind of burned me or something.
544	00:29:48	00:29:51	And that didn't seem weird to you?
545	00:29:51	00:29:52	I'm in college.
546	00:29:53	00:29:54	A lot of things seem weird to me.
547	00:29:54	00:29:57	Okay.
548	00:29:57	00:30:03	This thing... that burned your finger, where is it now? I tossed it.
549	00:30:04	00:30:05	Excuse me.
550	00:30:13	00:30:19	I don't see anything but a couple pieces of balled up paper and a soda can.
551	00:30:19	00:30:21	Nothing incendiary. It was there.
552	00:30:21	00:30:23	I don't know what to tell you, man.
553	00:30:23	00:30:31	All right, Zack, we are not going to take you into custody, but we are going to need access to your room for the rest of the day. Okay.
554	00:30:32	00:30:33	I'm late for Ancient History.
555	00:30:33	00:30:34	Can I go? Sure.
556	00:30:34	00:30:37	And this, uh, this nice officer...
557	00:30:37	00:30:39	he's gonna be your study buddy.
558	00:30:39	00:30:41	Thanks.
559	00:30:43	00:30:45	Well, what are you thinking?
560	00:30:45	00:30:51	Name a chemical compound that can burn skin and can also disappear into thin air.
561	00:30:51	00:30:53	The only thing I can think of is dry ice.
562	00:30:54	00:30:58	And dry ice releases carbon dioxide as it sublimates.
563	00:30:58	00:31:05	Yeah, but can you put enough dry ice in Zack's room to raise the amount of carbon dioxide in Trip's room to a lethal level?
564	00:31:05	00:31:07	Is that a dare?
565	00:31:36	00:31:38	Level's only 1.2.
566	00:31:38	00:31:41	We need more dry ice.
567	00:32:02	00:32:06	It took 30 pounds of dry ice to reach the lethal level of saturation.
568	00:32:06	00:32:08	On the floor, where the sleeping bag was.
569	00:32:08	00:32:12	Carbon dioxide is one and half times heavier than air.
570	00:32:12	00:32:17	You know, it's conceivable that if Trip and Paula had been sleeping in his bed, they might still be alive.
571	00:32:17	00:32:19	I think I know why the bodies turned pink.
572	00:32:19	00:32:20	Really?
573	00:32:20	00:32:22	Dry ice is cold.
574	00:32:22	00:32:28	The dry ice significantly lowered the temperature in both rooms, and the drastic decrease in temperature can turn a dead body pink.
575	00:32:28	00:32:31	We see it all the time when we pull dead bodies from frozen rivers.
576	00:32:31	00:32:33	Nice, Greg.
577	00:32:33	00:32:42	You know, if Zachary is telling the truth, and he simply burned his finger on a remnant of dry ice, who put it there?
578	00:32:42	00:32:48	I'll have P.D. run a credit card check on everyone in the dorm, see if anyone recently purchased a large quantity of dry ice.
579	00:32:48	00:32:51	Your decedent smells like a pine tree.
580	00:32:52	00:32:57	Whoever stole him probably sprayed his body with disinfectant to cover up the stench.
581	00:32:57	00:32:58	You got cause of death?
582	00:32:58	00:33:00	Yeah, he died of a heavy heart.
583	00:33:01	00:33:03	Heart weighed 500 grams instead of 300.
584	00:33:03	00:33:06	Hypertensive Cardiovascular disease.
585	00:33:06	00:33:09	So his heart stopped, he keeled over, hit his head on the pavement.
586	00:33:17	00:33:19	Do you think he was aware of his condition?
587	00:33:19	00:33:20	Oh, I know he was.
588	00:33:20	00:33:24	I sent blood to Tox, he was taking Atenolol.
589	00:33:24	00:33:26	A heart that size, he was a walking time bomb.
590	00:33:26	00:33:27	Anything else?
591	00:33:27	00:33:30	Yup, our guy chugged a beer, after he died.
592	00:33:30	00:33:33	Lungs were full of foam.
593	00:33:33	00:33:35	So somebody poured it down his throat?
594	00:33:35	00:33:38	Wouldn't be my postmortem beverage of choice, but to each his own.
595	00:33:38	00:33:40	So did you get any prints off that cooler drawer?
596	00:33:40	00:33:42	Three.
597	00:33:42	00:33:45	Two were yours, one was David's.
598	00:33:45	00:33:46	See you later.
599	00:34:28	00:34:30	Anything?
600	00:34:30	00:34:33	Just so you know, I moved all your trace evidence up to the top of my pile.
601	00:34:33	00:34:34	Well, thank you.
602	00:34:35	00:34:37	Why don't you quit blowing smoke and tell me about the cigar?
603	00:34:37	00:34:40	Low in nicotine, high in furfural.
604	00:34:40	00:34:43	I compared it to other tobacco samples from the Exemplar collection.
605	00:34:44	00:34:46	It's consistent with the Perdomo Reserve brand.
606	00:34:46	00:34:48	I took the liberty of calling a cigar society.
607	00:34:48	00:34:50	They referred me to the Vegas distributor.
608	00:34:50	00:34:52	Spoke to him directly.
609	00:34:52	00:34:55	Perdomos are very high-end.
610	00:34:55	00:34:57	He only made one sale this past month.
611	00:34:57	00:34:59	It was to a guy in Seven Hills.
612	00:34:59	00:35:01	Smells like my grandfather.
613	00:35:01	00:35:03	Am I interrupting?
614	00:35:03	00:35:04	Actually, yeah.
615	00:35:04	00:35:06	Conrad was about to pat me on the back.
616	00:35:06	00:35:09	What do you got for me, Neil?
617	00:35:09	00:35:11	Lifted four clear prints from the party hat.
618	00:35:11	00:35:15	They all came back to Preston Hayburn, from Henderson.
619	00:35:15	00:35:16	He's a paramedic.
620	00:35:16	00:35:18	Would've had access to the morgue.
621	00:35:18	00:35:19	Good work, Neil.
622	00:35:19	00:35:21	Good work.
623	00:35:21	00:35:21	I have a number.
624	00:35:21	00:35:22	Oh, me, too.
625	00:35:25	00:35:29	The woman he met on the plane said he was heading to party in Seven Hills.
626	00:35:29	00:35:31	I'll start there and then I'll head to Henderson.
627	00:35:31	00:35:32	Okay?
628	00:35:32	00:35:34	Yes.
629	00:35:38	00:35:40	I found this toilet behind my apartment complex.
630	00:35:40	00:35:43	It's, uh, volunteered for an experiment.
631	00:35:43	00:35:44	It's moving.
632	00:35:44	00:35:45	I put dry ice in the bowl.
633	00:35:45	00:35:49	So you're thinking that the killer might have put his excess dry ice in the dorm toilet.
634	00:35:49	00:35:52	When the ice was flushed, it would've lodged in the drain trap.
635	00:35:52	00:35:57	As the ice sublimated and gas was released, it would've built up, causing the toilet to explode.
636	00:35:57	00:35:58	Good theory.
637	00:35:58	00:36:00	I spoke with Brass.
638	00:36:00	00:36:02	Zack's alibi checks out.
639	00:36:02	00:36:04	He was in L.A. all week.
640	00:36:04	00:36:09	And, uh, P.D. checked credit card records.
641	00:36:09	00:36:11	No one in that dorm bought dry ice on credit.
642	00:36:11	00:36:18	There's only two retail outlets in 20 miles that sell it, and no one's purchased a large quantity of dry ice in the last few weeks.
643	00:36:22	00:36:26	Well, I think I explained the explod-o-potty.
644	00:36:26	00:36:28	Gregg, maybe the dry ice wasn't purchased.
645	00:36:28	00:36:30	I mean, we are looking at a university.
646	00:36:30	00:36:33	Science department would probably keep the stuff on hand.
647	00:36:33	00:36:35	Science major would have access.
648	00:36:35	00:36:38	I was his R.A.
649	00:36:38	00:36:40	The guy lived for basketball, beer and girls.
650	00:36:40	00:36:43	Didn't want much to do with dorm activities.
651	00:36:43	00:36:46	Have you... seen this before?
652	00:36:47	00:36:49	No.
653	00:36:49	00:36:54	Trip kept record of his, uh, relationships with women.
654	00:36:54	00:36:56	Your name is in here.
655	00:36:56	00:36:59	Three times.
656	00:36:59	00:37:02	On, uh, February 2nd, you hooked up for the first time.
657	00:37:02	00:37:05	Looks like second base.
658	00:37:05	00:37:14	On February 9th, you rounded third, and on February 18th, he got a grand slam.
659	00:37:14	00:37:15	He wrote that down?
660	00:37:15	00:37:17	Mm-hmm.
661	00:37:21	00:37:24	We had sex, I admit it.
662	00:37:24	00:37:25	No big deal.
663	00:37:25	00:37:28	I didn't tell you guys because I'm not exactly proud of it, okay?
664	00:37:28	00:37:31	Trip and Paula died from of carbon dioxide gas.
665	00:37:31	00:37:40	We already know that you have access to dry ice, and as a materials science grad student, you are familiar with the chemical properties.
666	00:37:40	00:37:42	This is crazy.
667	00:37:42	00:37:47	Last week, you checked out 40 pounds of dry ice from the campus lab.
668	00:37:47	00:37:48	My thesis is on metallurgy.
669	00:37:48	00:37:51	I use dry ice to test the physical constrains of certain metals.
670	00:37:51	00:37:58	I also spoke to your advisor who told me that your experiments require two pounds of dry ice, at most.
671	00:38:01	00:38:03	He broke your heart.
672	00:38:03	00:38:13	He led you on, he let you believe it was serious, and after you went all the way, you were history.
673	00:38:13	00:38:20	Look, this has been a wild ride, but if I gave you the impression that I want a relationship, then, uh...
674	00:38:20	00:38:21	I was an idiot.
675	00:38:24	00:38:28	I had been consulting my female advisees not to take that kind of crap.
676	00:38:28	00:38:33	You knew Zack was in L.A., so you broke into his room during the day and drilled a hole in the wall.
677	00:38:41	00:38:44	Later that night, you returned.
678	00:38:55	00:39:00	Trip and Paula were asleep,  passed out from the alcohol.
679	00:39:00	00:39:06	When the ice evaporated, the gas engulfed the room, killing them.
680	00:39:06	00:39:08	I didn't know Paula was there, and I never meant to kill Trip.
681	00:39:08	00:39:11	So drilling the hole in the wall and leaving the ice behind was an accident?
682	00:39:11	00:39:12	No, no, look.
683	00:39:12	00:39:14	Trip's room is 16 feet by nine feet.
684	00:39:14	00:39:18	I used exactly the right amount of ice just to make him sick.
685	00:39:19	00:39:23	If he had been in the bed three feet above the ground and not on the floor...
686	00:39:23	00:39:26	I just wanted him to miss his basketball game.
687	00:39:28	00:39:33	Trip only slept on the floor when he had girls over, and he never had sex before a big game.
688	00:39:33	00:39:36	He shouldn't have been on the floor.
689	00:39:36	00:39:43	Your science was perfect, your instincts were not so good.
690	00:39:43	00:39:51	And you miscalculated the sex drive of a college jock.
691	00:39:53	00:39:55	Who is it?
692	00:39:55	00:39:57	L.V.P.D.
693	00:40:05	00:40:06	Can I help you?
694	00:40:06	00:40:08	Are you Charlie Jackson?
695	00:40:08	00:40:08	Yeah.
696	00:40:08	00:40:09	Do you know a James Billmeyer?
697	00:40:09	00:40:12	Yeah, we went to high school together.
698	00:40:12	00:40:13	Are you aware that he passed away?
699	00:40:13	00:40:17	Yeah, yeah, it was a big blow; we were close.
700	00:40:17	00:40:19	You mind if we come in?
701	00:40:20	00:40:22	Yeah, come in.
702	00:40:33	00:40:35	You, uh...
703	00:40:35	00:40:39	smoke Perdomo Reserve?
704	00:40:39	00:40:41	Yeah, on special occasion.
705	00:40:41	00:40:43	Why?
706	00:40:43	00:40:45	Do you know a Preston Hayburn?
707	00:40:45	00:40:47	Paramedic from Henderson.
708	00:40:47	00:40:49	Yeah, he, James and I were tight.
709	00:40:49	00:40:51	We went to high school together. What's this about?
710	00:40:51	00:40:52	Cut the act, Charlie.
711	00:40:53	00:40:55	We know that Preston had access to the morgue.
712	00:40:55	00:40:58	We believe he stole James Billmeyer's body, maybe brought it here.
713	00:40:58	00:41:00	But what we don't know is why?
714	00:41:04	00:41:06	All right, James was dying.
715	00:41:06	00:41:14	He had a bad heart, everybody knew it, so we flew him out here for one last bash, and Preston got called to the Tangiers and it was Jamie.
716	00:41:14	00:41:16	The poor guy died in the parking lot.
717	00:41:16	00:41:17	And then what?
718	00:41:17	00:41:19	You decided to throw him a dead man's party?
719	00:41:19	00:41:22	Well, we already bought the booze.
720	00:41:38	00:41:40	He was my best friend, you know?
721	00:41:40	00:41:45	It's a class D felony to steal a corpse with the intent to sell or mutilate.
722	00:41:45	00:41:49	I'm not really sure how to classify partying with the dead.
723	00:41:49	00:41:52	Look, I know how it looks, but if you knew Jamie...
724	00:41:53	00:41:55	it's what he would've wanted.
725	00:41:55	00:41:56	And we did return him.
726	00:41:56	00:41:58	You're still under arrest.
727	00:41:58	00:42:01	Obstruction of justice and conspiracy to commit theft.
728	00:42:01	00:42:04	You're looking at one to four years, Charlie.
729	00:42:07	00:42:10	He would have done it for me.
