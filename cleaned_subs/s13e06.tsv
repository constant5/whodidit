0	00:00:04	00:00:06	Pass it, there you go.
1	00:00:06	00:00:07	Get it in.
2	00:00:07	00:00:08	Now get back, hustle back.
3	00:00:08	00:00:10	Russell, hustle.
4	00:00:10	00:00:13	Pass the ball, get rid of it.
5	00:00:13	00:00:15	There you go.
6	00:00:15	00:00:16	D up.
7	00:00:18	00:00:19	Nicely done.
8	00:00:19	00:00:20	There you go.
9	00:00:22	00:00:24	Use your feet, Russell. Use your feet.
10	00:00:24	00:00:26	Stay low... Stay low!
11	00:00:26	00:00:28	Don't reach! (blows whistle)
12	00:00:28	00:00:30	What the hell are you doing?
13	00:00:30	00:00:31	I'm playing D, Coach.
14	00:00:31	00:00:33	Try doing it like you're not in high school.
15	00:00:33	00:00:35	Coach... You shut up.
16	00:00:37	00:00:38	You sit your ass down.
17	00:00:38	00:00:40	What, are you serious?
18	00:00:40	00:00:43	You gonna cry like a little bitch, huh?
19	00:00:43	00:00:44	Get the hell off my damn court.
20	00:00:44	00:00:46	Hey, Charlie, Charlie.
21	00:00:46	00:00:49	You want to ride the bench for the rest of the season, Russell?
22	00:00:55	00:00:57	Tell Austin this is a closed practice.
23	00:00:57	00:01:01	He's the president of the university and he's sitting next to the guy whose name is on this gym.
24	00:01:01	00:01:05	It's not his gym... it's mine.
25	00:01:05	00:01:07	Kick 'em both out.
26	00:01:07	00:01:08	Now.
27	00:01:31	00:01:33	Oh, look at that.
28	00:01:33	00:01:36	I'm so glad you're home.
29	00:01:36	00:01:38	Me too.
30	00:01:39	00:01:41	No more bacon.
31	00:01:41	00:01:42	What do you mean?
32	00:01:42	00:01:46	Oh, please, you think I don't know what you do when I'm not here?
33	00:01:46	00:01:49	I always said you were a better detective than me.
34	00:01:49	00:01:52	Oh, I think Charlie has a girlfriend.
35	00:01:52	00:01:53	What's your evidence?
36	00:01:53	00:01:55	Laundry.
37	00:01:55	00:01:59	He's bought new clothes, and they're not the kind you play basketball in.
38	00:01:59	00:02:00	They're the kind you...
39	00:02:00	00:02:01	Wear to impress someone.
40	00:02:01	00:02:02	And I saw him washing his car.
41	00:02:02	00:02:04	Oh, dear Lord, must be serious.
42	00:02:07	00:02:09	I'm sorry.
43	00:02:09	00:02:11	Yeah, Jim, what's up?
44	00:02:11	00:02:14	And I'm gonna want to talk to the maintenance guy...
45	00:02:14	00:02:16	Yeah, I'll walk over there with you.
46	00:02:18	00:02:22	00 a.m.
47	00:02:22	00:02:23	David, can I see him, please?
48	00:02:23	00:02:25	Oh, yeah.
49	00:02:28	00:02:31	Tom Burns was a hell of a coach.
50	00:02:31	00:02:35	He started recruiting Charlie in junior high.
51	00:02:35	00:02:37	Charlie thought the world of him.
52	00:02:37	00:02:39	He's not the only one.
53	00:02:39	00:02:43	Well, my guys said they didn't touch anything, so it's all yours.
54	00:02:54	00:02:56	Liver temp?
55	00:02:56	00:02:58	Uh, 97 on the nose.
56	00:02:58	00:03:02	Warm water, naked body on cold tile.
57	00:03:02	00:03:05	If my math's right, couldn't be dead much more than about three hours.
58	00:03:05	00:03:11	So that puts time of death around 00, 5 Guy was an early riser.
59	00:03:11	00:03:13	Yeah, old habits die hard.
60	00:03:13	00:03:15	He used to play ball for West Point.
61	00:03:15	00:03:20	00 in the morning, jogs to the campus, works out, then jumps in the pool for 30 laps.
62	00:03:20	00:03:21	Be enough to kill me.
63	00:03:21	00:03:25	Well, somebody gave the coach a little help.
64	00:04:03	00:04:05	So I talked to the janitor.
65	00:04:05	00:04:07	00 a.m.
66	00:04:07	00:04:09	Coach Burns had a key.
67	00:04:09	00:04:10	Yeah.
68	00:04:10	00:04:16	Okay, so Coach Burns finishes his workout and then he comes to take a shower.
69	00:04:16	00:04:19	Someone comes in and hits him from behind.
70	00:04:21	00:04:25	First swing's always for free, no blood.
71	00:04:25	00:04:26	He goes down.
72	00:04:26	00:04:28	Killer goes to town.
73	00:04:30	00:04:36	Elongated blood drops suggest that it was at a low angle and multiple blows.
74	00:04:36	00:04:39	There's no sign of the murder weapon anywhere.
75	00:04:39	00:04:40	Took it with him.
76	00:04:40	00:04:41	Looks like...
77	00:04:41	00:04:46	someone tried to clean up to cover their tracks.
78	00:04:46	00:04:48	Here you go.
79	00:04:49	00:04:50	Could you hit the lights?
80	00:04:56	00:04:58	Swipe marks.
81	00:04:58	00:05:02	Arcing suggests the killer backed out of the shower into the locker room.
82	00:05:02	00:05:04	Covering his tracks.
83	00:05:04	00:05:09	Then the cleanup stops, yeah, right about here.
84	00:05:09	00:05:11	To the naked eye. Hmm, not to ours.
85	00:05:11	00:05:13	Shoe impressions.
86	00:05:13	00:05:15	Just the front half.
87	00:05:18	00:05:20	Heading towards the locker room exit.
88	00:05:22	00:05:26	Spacing-- only the balls of the feet.
89	00:05:26	00:05:31	Suggests running. The other impressions-- also evenly spaced, heading towards the door.
90	00:05:31	00:05:33	It's an odd pattern.
91	00:05:33	00:05:36	Sport shoe, maybe cleats?
92	00:05:36	00:05:38	We might be looking for more than one killer.
93	00:05:47	00:05:49	Oh, wrong room, I'm so sorry.
94	00:05:49	00:05:51	Dad, what are you doing here?
95	00:05:52	00:05:56	Oh, hey, um, I would have called, but...
96	00:05:56	00:05:57	Sorry.
97	00:05:57	00:05:59	No, I'm sorry.
98	00:05:59	00:06:01	You are Charlie's dad, and I...
99	00:06:01	00:06:04	This is so not how I wanted us to meet.
100	00:06:04	00:06:07	Dad, this is Vanessa, my girlfriend.
101	00:06:07	00:06:09	Think I got that part.
102	00:06:09	00:06:11	So, what's going on?
103	00:06:11	00:06:15	Charlie... (sighs heavily) Coach Burns is dead.
104	00:06:15	00:06:17	He's dead?
105	00:06:17	00:06:18	Oh, my God.
106	00:06:18	00:06:20	What happened?
107	00:06:20	00:06:24	Actually, I'd like to talk to you in private about that, Not at all.
108	00:06:24	00:06:26	I'm so sorry.
109	00:06:26	00:06:28	I'll call you later, okay?
110	00:06:28	00:06:29	Yeah.
111	00:06:31	00:06:33	Charlie, Coach was murdered.
112	00:06:33	00:06:34	What?
113	00:06:34	00:06:36	Yeah.
114	00:06:40	00:06:42	I'm so sorry.
115	00:06:42	00:06:44	What happened?
116	00:06:44	00:06:48	Do you know if any of the players had a beef with him?
117	00:06:48	00:06:51	All of us... at one point or another.
118	00:06:51	00:06:55	I mean, right or wrong, we all think we're superstars going to the NBA.
119	00:06:55	00:06:59	Egos get out of hand, Coach slaps 'em down.
120	00:06:59	00:07:01	Did he slap down anyone in particular?
121	00:07:01	00:07:03	Yeah, but it wasn't a player.
122	00:07:03	00:07:11	Last night, after practice, I, I was in the shower, and I know it sounds weird, but I felt like, like someone was there.
123	00:07:11	00:07:15	I didn't see them, but it was like they were watching me, like, waiting for me to leave.
124	00:07:15	00:07:18	Okay, w-what's this have to do with Coach?
125	00:07:18	00:07:26	Well, after I left the gym, I, I had to come back 'cause I left my dorm key, and that's when I heard them arguing-- Coach and Jack Oxford.
126	00:07:26	00:07:28	Oxford--the, the deep pockets guy?
127	00:07:28	00:07:30	Yeah, Mr. Hedge Fund.
128	00:07:30	00:07:33	I put $8 million into this school, into this program.
129	00:07:33	00:07:35	I deserve some respect.
130	00:07:35	00:07:37	Respect is earned, not bought.
131	00:07:37	00:07:43	I didn't hear much, but, you know, money, the team-- the same crap they always argue about.
132	00:07:44	00:07:47	Okay, um, I got to get back.
133	00:07:47	00:07:49	Come here, buddy; come here.
134	00:07:51	00:07:57	Oh, wait a minute now, the girlfriend--been going together long?
135	00:07:57	00:07:58	A couple months. Oh.
136	00:07:58	00:08:00	Thanks for sharing.
137	00:08:00	00:08:01	Is she nice?
138	00:08:01	00:08:03	Yeah.
139	00:08:03	00:08:04	Good.
140	00:08:04	00:08:05	I'll call you.
141	00:08:05	00:08:07	Yeah.
142	00:08:09	00:08:12	Those are some pretty nasty head wounds there, Doc.
143	00:08:12	00:08:15	Victim was struck at least nine times to the head and the face.
144	00:08:15	00:08:19	Fractured skull, nose, cheekbone.
145	00:08:20	00:08:22	And no defensive wounds.
146	00:08:22	00:08:23	Guy never had a chance.
147	00:08:23	00:08:30	Well, I found two different wound patterns-- one large and flat, the other small and triangular.
148	00:08:30	00:08:34	The large wounds have clean margins, show signs of caving.
149	00:08:34	00:08:36	The smaller ones are deeper and sharper.
150	00:08:36	00:08:40	So two different weapons or one weapon used two different ways?
151	00:08:40	00:08:44	I can't tell you, but what I can tell you is, our victim was no stranger to violence lately.
152	00:08:44	00:08:46	What do you mean?
153	00:08:46	00:08:50	Well, his left nares had clotted blood from a recent antemortem injury.
154	00:08:50	00:08:54	So someone punched him in the nose before his head got caved in?
155	00:08:54	00:08:56	By several hours, I'd say.
156	00:08:56	00:09:00	I found injuries that even predate that.
157	00:09:00	00:09:01	Bruising.
158	00:09:01	00:09:03	How long ago do you think this was?
159	00:09:03	00:09:04	Two or three days.
160	00:09:04	00:09:11	David found this when he was washing the body-- a dried substance on the forehead.
161	00:09:11	00:09:13	He took a swab, sent it off to DNA.
162	00:09:13	00:09:16	Circular, gravitational.
163	00:09:16	00:09:18	I can tell you what it looks like from here.
164	00:09:18	00:09:20	I didn't find any evidence of sexual assault.
165	00:09:20	00:09:24	You know, sometimes a beating is just a beating.
166	00:09:24	00:09:27	Yeah, Burns and I got into it. So what?
167	00:09:27	00:09:29	We had some things to discuss.
168	00:09:29	00:09:31	Like what?
169	00:09:31	00:09:32	None of your business.
170	00:09:32	00:09:39	You know, a witness at last night's practice told us the coach had you and the university president kicked out of the gym.
171	00:09:39	00:09:40	Your gym.
172	00:09:40	00:09:41	Damn right it's my gym.
173	00:09:41	00:09:43	That'd make me mad.
174	00:09:43	00:09:46	Well, that's the difference between you and me.
175	00:09:46	00:09:50	I manage a hedge fund worth $9 billion.
176	00:09:50	00:09:54	This watch--probably worth more than you make in a year.
177	00:09:54	00:09:58	I don't get mad, Detective; I get what I want.
178	00:09:58	00:10:02	And did you want Coach Burns dead in the shower-- this morning--of your gym?
179	00:10:02	00:10:04	What's the upside in that?
180	00:10:04	00:10:06	All the millions of dollars I put into this program...
181	00:10:06	00:10:10	Killing the head coach-- not exactly a shrewd business strategy.
182	00:10:10	00:10:11	What's your point?
183	00:10:11	00:10:18	When a naked basketball coach gets beaten to death in the showers, it's not a good thing.
184	00:10:18	00:10:20	Your compassion is overwhelming.
185	00:10:20	00:10:28	And so is your incompetence, because every minute you spend in here with me is a minute you could be out there looking for the guy that did this.
186	00:10:28	00:10:31	Why, look at that, I have to go.
187	00:10:34	00:10:35	Don't go far.
188	00:10:39	00:10:41	Well, you were right, Madame Poirot, about our son.
189	00:10:41	00:10:44	I just met his girlfriend.
190	00:10:44	00:10:45	Charlie said you walked in on them.
191	00:10:45	00:10:47	Did he? Yeah, yeah, I did.
192	00:10:47	00:10:49	Remember, we were supposed to have dinner tonight.
193	00:10:49	00:10:50	Really?
194	00:10:50	00:10:53	I thought, with everything that's going on, maybe he'd reschedule.
195	00:10:53	00:10:55	I guess he has other things on his mind.
196	00:10:55	00:10:58	He asked me to set another place at the table.
197	00:10:58	00:11:00	She's a vegetarian.
198	00:11:00	00:11:03	Well, I guess she'll fit right in, then, huh?
199	00:11:41	00:11:43	Hey, Henry.
200	00:11:43	00:11:46	Hey, uh, bloody towels were a match to Coach Burns.
201	00:11:46	00:11:48	Definitely what was used to clean up the crime scene.
202	00:11:48	00:11:49	No more locker room laundry.
203	00:11:49	00:11:52	I just went through three carts of dirty towels.
204	00:11:52	00:11:54	This whole place smells like feet.
205	00:11:54	00:11:58	Now it is going to smell like something else.
206	00:11:58	00:12:02	(sighs) Give me the ruler. And you might want to borrow some of Russell's incense.
207	00:12:02	00:12:03	Pretty ripe.
208	00:12:03	00:12:06	(sighs) Wait.
209	00:12:06	00:12:08	That's blood spatter.
210	00:12:08	00:12:09	Medium velocity.
211	00:12:09	00:12:12	Well, that's not from any kind of cleanup.
212	00:12:12	00:12:15	Spatter like that only gets on someone one way.
213	00:12:15	00:12:17	I think we have a suspect.
214	00:12:22	00:12:24	You really ought to do your own laundry, kid.
215	00:12:24	00:12:29	We tested the blood on your jersey, T.J., and it matches the coach.
216	00:12:29	00:12:34	It's also the same as the blood that was on the towels that were used to try to wipe up the killer's footprints.
217	00:12:34	00:12:36	We know that Coach Burns kept a tight schedule, predictable.
218	00:12:36	00:12:37	Whoever killed him knew that.
219	00:12:37	00:12:39	And knew their way around the gym.
220	00:12:39	00:12:41	Burns was a hard-ass, we all know that.
221	00:12:41	00:12:45	Maybe he got what was coming to him. No.
222	00:12:45	00:12:49	I mean, yeah, Coach is tough.
223	00:12:49	00:12:50	And sometimes that was hard, but...
224	00:12:50	00:12:52	I respected him.
225	00:12:52	00:12:55	I'd never...
226	00:12:55	00:12:56	I understand.
227	00:12:56	00:13:00	Charlie's on the team; I've heard all the stories.
228	00:13:00	00:13:02	But maybe there's something that we don't know about.
229	00:13:02	00:13:07	Well, whoever killed him had a lot of rage.
230	00:13:07	00:13:10	Beating a man naked in the shower...
231	00:13:10	00:13:12	Whoa, whoa, whoa... whoa, wait a minute.
232	00:13:12	00:13:15	If you're suggesting what I think you are, n-no way.
233	00:13:15	00:13:17	Coach wasn't like that.
234	00:13:17	00:13:19	And I wasn't anywhere near the gym this morning.
235	00:13:19	00:13:21	How do you explain the blood on your jersey?
236	00:13:23	00:13:26	Come on, T.J., you got to tell us something here.
237	00:13:26	00:13:29	Otherwise, we won't be able to help you.
238	00:13:31	00:13:36	Last night, after practice, there was a fight in the locker room.
239	00:13:36	00:13:37	Somebody threw a punch at Coach.
240	00:13:37	00:13:40	I stepped in to try to stop it.
241	00:13:40	00:13:43	That's how the blood got on my jersey.
242	00:13:43	00:13:45	Okay. All right, thank you.
243	00:13:45	00:13:46	Who threw the punch?
244	00:13:51	00:13:52	Your son.
245	00:14:00	00:14:02	I need more focus, Russell.
246	00:14:02	00:14:05	Commitment. The goal is to chase titles, not girls.
247	00:14:05	00:14:10	Excuse me? Look, ever since you've started dating that tramp-- what's her name? Vanessa...
248	00:14:10	00:14:11	Don't talk about her like that.
249	00:14:11	00:14:13	That's what she is, right? A tramp.
250	00:14:16	00:14:18	You're done!
251	00:14:18	00:14:19	You're done.
252	00:14:23	00:14:24	What T.J. told you was true.
253	00:14:24	00:14:27	I... I did take a swing at the coach.
254	00:14:27	00:14:28	Where were you this morning, Charlie?
255	00:14:28	00:14:31	00 a.m.
256	00:14:31	00:14:33	Went to the stadium, ran steps.
257	00:14:33	00:14:35	Can anyone verify your whereabouts?
258	00:14:35	00:14:36	Is that really necessary?
259	00:14:36	00:14:38	Yes, it is.
260	00:14:38	00:14:44	Um... nobody saw me at the stadium, but Vanessa was here when I woke up.
261	00:14:44	00:14:45	She saw me leave.
262	00:14:45	00:14:48	I was working out for an hour and a half.
263	00:14:48	00:14:50	Then I met up with her for breakfast.
264	00:14:50	00:14:51	Who's Vanessa?
265	00:14:51	00:14:54	It's his girlfriend. D.B.
266	00:14:54	00:14:56	Who's Vanessa, Charlie?
267	00:14:56	00:14:58	Vanessa Drake. She's a student.
268	00:14:58	00:15:00	A grad student. Psychology.
269	00:15:00	00:15:02	I can give you her number. (phone beeping)
270	00:15:02	00:15:04	Yeah, I'm gonna need that. Hold on, I'm getting a text.
271	00:15:04	00:15:08	Coach Burns' wife just got back into town-- she was in Tahoe.
272	00:15:08	00:15:10	I'm going to interview her at the P.D.
273	00:15:10	00:15:12	Okay, we're all done here, Charlie.
274	00:15:12	00:15:18	But you understand the seriousness of this, right? We have to follow every possible lead-- don't go anywhere.
275	00:15:22	00:15:26	Look, Dad, it... it's not like I didn't want to tell you about what happened with Coach.
276	00:15:26	00:15:28	And besides, I didn't think it was pertinent.
277	00:15:28	00:15:30	Pertinent?
278	00:15:30	00:15:33	The man was murdered, Charlie, hours after you physically assaulted him!
279	00:15:33	00:15:35	What could be more pertinent than that?
280	00:15:35	00:15:37	I punched him. He deserved it.
281	00:15:37	00:15:39	You know, that's another conversation.
282	00:15:39	00:15:45	Right now my problem is, you are a suspect in a homicide investigation.
283	00:15:45	00:15:46	I mean, you know what really pisses me off?
284	00:15:46	00:15:50	I had to find out about that from a witness in an interrogation room.
285	00:15:50	00:15:53	Am I really a suspect? Yeah, you are. You lied.
286	00:15:53	00:15:55	I didn't lie; I just didn't tell you.
287	00:15:55	00:15:56	Don't--don't do that. Come on.
288	00:15:56	00:15:59	We didn't raise you like that.
289	00:15:59	00:16:04	How many times have I told you, there's nothing that could happen in the world that you couldn't come and tell me about.
290	00:16:04	00:16:08	You also told me to be my own person, to fight my own fights, to live my own life, Dad.
291	00:16:08	00:16:13	If you don't know the difference between being independent and being honest, then I don't know what to say to you.
292	00:16:13	00:16:15	I really don't.
293	00:16:34	00:16:35	Something's different about you.
294	00:16:37	00:16:39	Did you get a haircut?
295	00:16:39	00:16:41	Heels.
296	00:16:41	00:16:43	Something you want to tell me?
297	00:16:43	00:16:44	Yes.
298	00:16:44	00:16:50	I have identified... one set of shoe impressions from our crime scene. Heels.
299	00:16:50	00:16:53	Sara was right-- running from the scene. Fast women.
300	00:16:53	00:16:55	Always dangerous.
301	00:16:55	00:16:57	What about the other shoe impressions?
302	00:16:57	00:17:01	Well, Finlay seems to think that they're from some sort of athletic shoe or a cleat.
303	00:17:01	00:17:03	So far...
304	00:17:03	00:17:10	I got nothing. Well, you know, the database is only updated every six months, so there's probably some that aren't in there yet.
305	00:17:10	00:17:12	Mm. You might have to go on a shopping spree.
306	00:17:12	00:17:13	Want to go with?
307	00:17:13	00:17:15	Sure.
308	00:17:15	00:17:17	But isn't there one stop you need to make first?
309	00:17:17	00:17:19	Where's that?
310	00:17:19	00:17:23	Charlie Russell is a suspect, so...
311	00:17:23	00:17:28	you're gonna have to raid his closet and... you're gonna have to clear it with his dad.
312	00:17:28	00:17:31	Hmm. Not a good day to ask for a raise.
313	00:17:31	00:17:33	Mrs. Burns...
314	00:17:33	00:17:35	I'm sorry for your loss.
315	00:17:35	00:17:37	I need to ask you some questions.
316	00:17:37	00:17:40	I understand. Now, you said you were in Tahoe last night.
317	00:17:40	00:17:43	I went up there on Wednesday to close up our cabin.
318	00:17:43	00:17:47	Once basketball season starts, there's really no time for weekend getaways.
319	00:17:47	00:17:52	I got back this afternoon-- that's when I got your message.
320	00:17:52	00:17:53	About Tom.
321	00:17:53	00:17:56	So when was the last time you two spoke?
322	00:17:56	00:17:57	A few days ago.
323	00:17:59	00:18:01	I know what you're thinking, but for us, that was normal.
324	00:18:01	00:18:04	Especially at this time of year.
325	00:18:04	00:18:07	Tom was always so focused on getting ready for the season.
326	00:18:07	00:18:10	So no problems with your marriage, then?
327	00:18:10	00:18:17	We had our struggles, but unlike most men, he was at least willing to work on our relationship, go to couples therapy.
328	00:18:17	00:18:19	How was that working out?
329	00:18:19	00:18:21	It was good.
330	00:18:21	00:18:23	Things were...
331	00:18:23	00:18:25	improving.
332	00:18:25	00:18:32	Mrs. Burns, I'm gonna need a sample of your DNA and permission to search your house.
333	00:18:32	00:18:34	It's standard procedure.
334	00:18:34	00:18:37	I didn't kill my husband, Detective.
335	00:18:37	00:18:38	I'm not saying you did.
336	00:18:38	00:18:40	Sure.
337	00:18:40	00:18:42	Whatever you need.
338	00:18:42	00:18:46	This is some of the stuff we found in Coach Burns' house.
339	00:18:46	00:18:48	You're sure these, uh...
340	00:18:48	00:18:51	these, these things belonged to him?
341	00:18:51	00:18:55	We definitely found them in Coach Burns' house.
342	00:18:55	00:18:57	Actually, in his man cave in the basement.
343	00:18:57	00:19:00	His wife said that it was a home office.
344	00:19:00	00:19:02	I'm assuming you had no idea about his hobby.
345	00:19:02	00:19:04	No, of course not. Right.
346	00:19:04	00:19:07	I-I assume you'll be, uh, discreet about this.
347	00:19:07	00:19:11	This sort of information could do irreparable damage to the university.
348	00:19:11	00:19:19	I understand your concern, and I share it-- my son goes to your school-- but our job's not to protect the university, it's to find out who killed the coach.
349	00:19:19	00:19:21	I thought I knew the man.
350	00:19:21	00:19:22	Well, so did I.
351	00:19:22	00:19:25	Thanks for your time, President Austin. Thank you.
352	00:19:30	00:19:31	what else did you find?
353	00:19:31	00:19:33	I ALS'd the bedroom.
354	00:19:33	00:19:35	It lit up like the Strip.
355	00:19:35	00:19:37	Well, his wife was away for several days, she said.
356	00:19:37	00:19:39	Yeah, when the wife's away, the coach will play.
357	00:19:39	00:19:41	Tell Henry to get to work.
358	00:19:41	00:19:44	Let's find out who he's been playing with.
359	00:19:44	00:19:46	Thank you so much for dinner, Mrs. Russell.
360	00:19:46	00:19:48	It was lovely. You're very welcome.
361	00:19:48	00:19:51	So, Vanessa, are you a graduate student?
362	00:19:51	00:19:53	Going for my master's in psychology.
363	00:19:53	00:19:56	I assume, in your work, psychology often comes into play?
364	00:19:56	00:20:00	Yeah, yeah, I'm usually dealing with people at their worst, so...
365	00:20:00	00:20:04	I bet. It's a tragedy with Coach Burns-- it's so awful.
366	00:20:04	00:20:10	Do you have any idea yet what happened or--or who could have done something like this? Actually, I can't talk about an ongoing investigation.
367	00:20:10	00:20:12	Oh, right, of course. Sorry.
368	00:20:12	00:20:16	Uh, so, Mom, Dad...
369	00:20:16	00:20:21	Vanessa and I have been talking, and...we have decided to move in together.
370	00:20:24	00:20:28	I know it's soon, but... no secrets, right?
371	00:20:28	00:20:29	Right.
372	00:20:31	00:20:34	Oh, my, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize how late it was.
373	00:20:34	00:20:39	I'm leading a discussion section in the morning, so I got to go. I should get back, too, actually. Okay.
374	00:20:39	00:20:41	Nice to see you again.
375	00:20:41	00:20:43	You too.
376	00:20:43	00:20:44	Yes, we need Thank you.
377	00:20:44	00:20:46	to do this again sometime.
378	00:20:53	00:20:54	Ouch!
379	00:21:19	00:21:22	I--I think you need a little more wrist there.
380	00:21:24	00:21:26	You better have my DNA results.
381	00:21:26	00:21:29	Sorry, I was just waiting for, uh, for that.
382	00:21:29	00:21:33	Coach Burns was a naughty boy.
383	00:21:33	00:21:36	DNA from our sex toys and the sheets in Coach's bedroom.
384	00:21:36	00:21:39	Coach and...
385	00:21:39	00:21:40	someone not his wife.
386	00:21:40	00:21:42	Unknown female.
387	00:21:42	00:21:45	Maybe moving up our suspect list. Why do you say that?
388	00:21:45	00:21:50	Doc took I.R. photos of the bruising on Coach Burns' chest and back.
389	00:21:52	00:21:55	Guess we know how he got those nasty bruises.
390	00:21:55	00:22:00	Getting nasty. Whoever was riding him in bed, maybe it's the same person who dropped him in the shower.
391	00:22:00	00:22:05	Having fun in bed's a long way from bludgeoning somebody to death in a shower, don't you think?
392	00:22:05	00:22:08	But it is our best lead, so...all right.
393	00:22:08	00:22:10	Let's find out who this unknown female is.
394	00:22:12	00:22:13	Hey, Russell? Yeah?
395	00:22:13	00:22:15	Come here for a sec.
396	00:22:15	00:22:16	What you got?
397	00:22:16	00:22:18	I got Burns' cell phone records.
398	00:22:18	00:22:25	Now, I know these guys chase recruits, but this is ridiculous. He made, like, over 200 phone calls in one day, and even more than that in text messages.
399	00:22:25	00:22:27	Forget about the recruits.
400	00:22:27	00:22:29	We're looking for a woman now that's good with a riding crop.
401	00:22:29	00:22:31	Oh, really? Well, hold on.
402	00:22:31	00:22:32	This may interest you.
403	00:22:32	00:22:37	On the night before the murder, Burns made three phone calls, all with the same number; disposable phone.
404	00:22:37	00:22:40	And a text--look at this.
405	00:22:40	00:22:43	Feeling naughty. Need some discipline.
406	00:22:46	00:22:47	Can't make it to your place.
407	00:22:47	00:22:49	Find me at The Iris. Obey.
408	00:22:49	00:22:51	Mistress Z.
409	00:22:51	00:22:52	Sounds like our girl to me.
410	00:22:54	00:22:57	You know anything about The Iris?
411	00:22:57	00:23:00	No, but that information's pretty easy to get.
412	00:23:06	00:23:08	There you are.
413	00:23:11	00:23:12	This way.
414	00:23:12	00:23:14	Nighty-night.
415	00:23:14	00:23:16	Good evening, gentlemen.
416	00:23:16	00:23:19	Hi. Evening.
417	00:23:19	00:23:22	Well, Lily said that you were looking for something special.
418	00:23:22	00:23:24	Yeah, my buddy here needs a little, um...
419	00:23:24	00:23:25	a little discipline.
420	00:23:25	00:23:29	Yeah. Yeah, I heard Mistress Z really knows how to punish a man.
421	00:23:29	00:23:31	I'm sorry.
422	00:23:31	00:23:33	Are you on the list?
423	00:23:33	00:23:35	Uh... Uh, no, we're not, actually.
424	00:23:35	00:23:36	A friend of ours sent us here.
425	00:23:36	00:23:37	Tom Burns.
426	00:23:39	00:23:41	I think you need to leave.
427	00:23:41	00:23:43	Mm. I think we're gonna stay.
428	00:23:43	00:23:46	Seeing as how we're with the crime lab.
429	00:23:46	00:23:48	You want me to just...? I can set it right here.
430	00:23:48	00:23:51	No, it's fine.
431	00:23:51	00:23:52	Right this way.
432	00:23:52	00:23:54	Okeydoke.
433	00:24:00	00:24:04	Mistress Z, these gentlemen would like to have a word.
434	00:24:04	00:24:07	Gentlemen, what can I do for...?
435	00:24:11	00:24:13	Nice to see you, Mr. Russell.
436	00:24:16	00:24:17	This is awkward.
437	00:24:17	00:24:21	Oh, it's a lot more than that, actually.
438	00:24:26	00:24:29	So, what do we call you?
439	00:24:29	00:24:30	Mistress Z?
440	00:24:30	00:24:32	Vanessa?
441	00:24:32	00:24:33	What is it you wanted to talk to me about?
442	00:24:33	00:24:35	Coach Tom Burns.
443	00:24:35	00:24:38	Phone records indicate that you two had an ongoing relationship-- is that right?
444	00:24:38	00:24:40	Not sure I'd characterize it that way.
445	00:24:40	00:24:42	Yeah, neither would I.
446	00:24:42	00:24:45	Coach Burns had bruises all over his body.
447	00:24:45	00:24:48	I'm assuming it was you who... disciplined him?
448	00:24:48	00:24:51	Tom Burns was a client. Ah.
449	00:24:51	00:24:52	Client. That's what you call it.
450	00:24:52	00:24:56	We found evidence of a woman at the crime scene.
451	00:24:56	00:24:57	00 a.m. this morning?
452	00:24:57	00:25:00	Why don't you ask Mr. Russell's son?
453	00:25:03	00:25:07	Charlie said that he went to work out, and left you in his bed.
454	00:25:07	00:25:09	That's true.
455	00:25:09	00:25:14	15, and then we got an early breakfast.
456	00:25:14	00:25:16	Ah.
457	00:25:16	00:25:20	I didn't kill Tom Burns.
458	00:25:20	00:25:22	Well, if you didn't, maybe you know who did then.
459	00:25:22	00:25:30	This was a crime of passion; this guy was beaten to death. Maybe one of your clients got jealous 'cause he couldn't have you all to himself.
460	00:25:30	00:25:32	I have nothing more to say.
461	00:25:32	00:25:35	Well, you know, we could drive you downtown... Vanessa.
462	00:25:35	00:25:38	We could book you for solicitation.
463	00:25:38	00:25:40	I am not a hooker, Mr. Russell.
464	00:25:40	00:25:41	No? What are you then?
465	00:25:41	00:25:47	I am a licensed sex therapist, which, aside from being perfectly legal, also entitles me to therapist-patient privilege.
466	00:25:47	00:25:49	I don't have to tell you anything.
467	00:25:49	00:25:53	So you're telling me that all these women running around in here are licensed therapists?
468	00:25:53	00:25:58	Yes, they are. You can book a session with any one of them if you feel the need.
469	00:25:58	00:26:01	Does my son know what you do?
470	00:26:01	00:26:03	Like I said...
471	00:26:03	00:26:05	I have nothing more to say.
472	00:26:14	00:26:16	Oh, I didn't hear you come in last night.
473	00:26:17	00:26:19	Didn't want to wake you.
474	00:26:19	00:26:21	(gentle laugh) Hey.
475	00:26:22	00:26:24	I was up all night...
476	00:26:24	00:26:27	thinking about Charlie, Vanessa.
477	00:26:27	00:26:29	I'm with you on that one.
478	00:26:29	00:26:31	Just seems so early for them to move in together.
479	00:26:31	00:26:33	They barely know each other.
480	00:26:33	00:26:36	Did you run the dishwasher last night?
481	00:26:36	00:26:38	No. Why?
482	00:26:38	00:26:40	Just asking.
483	00:26:40	00:26:44	I guess that's the danger of raising an independent child.
484	00:26:44	00:26:45	You might actually succeed.
485	00:26:45	00:26:49	I guess it is their decision to make, right?
486	00:26:49	00:26:55	I mean, where would we be if we'd waited for my parents to approve of you?
487	00:26:55	00:26:57	Is that's Vanessa's wine glass?
488	00:26:57	00:27:01	You are not seriously going to run her DNA?
489	00:27:01	00:27:03	Are you gonna do a background check?
490	00:27:03	00:27:06	Trust me on this one, Detective.
491	00:27:06	00:27:07	What does that mean?
492	00:27:07	00:27:09	It means trust me.
493	00:27:09	00:27:11	I'll call you.
494	00:27:13	00:27:17	I just had the strangest experience.
495	00:27:17	00:27:26	I found Henry swabbing a wine glass that you quietly slipped him in order to obtain a potential suspect's DNA.
496	00:27:26	00:27:32	I hope you got a warrant, because, as I recall, I was fired by my boss in Seattle for doing the exact same thing.
497	00:27:32	00:27:35	Are you through? No, no, no, no.
498	00:27:35	00:27:38	I have a lot more things I'd like to say. 'Cause it's not the same thing.
499	00:27:38	00:27:45	It's my wine glass in my house, and-and-and the DNA happens to come from a hooker who's banging my son.
500	00:27:45	00:27:46	So, no, not the same thing.
501	00:27:49	00:27:50	Well, your suspicions were confirmed.
502	00:27:50	00:27:54	What do you mean? The DNA matched our unknown female.
503	00:27:54	00:27:58	Vanessa was definitely sleeping with the coach.
504	00:27:58	00:28:00	That's great.
505	00:28:00	00:28:08	So, my-my son is in a love triangle involving his coach, who, you know, he happened to have a violent confrontation with just hours before the man was killed, and...
506	00:28:08	00:28:15	shoe impressions at the scene suggest a woman and somebody else, and the someone else's footwear looks like it could be an athlete.
507	00:28:15	00:28:17	So it just gets better and better.
508	00:28:17	00:28:23	Hodges analyzed all of Charlie's shoes, and none of them fit the mystery pattern.
509	00:28:23	00:28:26	D.B., I've known your son since he was ten.
510	00:28:26	00:28:29	There is no way that he is a killer.
511	00:28:30	00:28:33	I--I know that. I know that.
512	00:28:33	00:28:35	But he's keeping something from me.
513	00:28:35	00:28:39	And you know, it wouldn't be the first time some idiot kid did something stupid for love.
514	00:28:39	00:28:42	Do you think he's lying to protect Vanessa?
515	00:28:42	00:28:43	I have no idea, but I'll tell you something.
516	00:28:43	00:28:47	If he wasn't my son, he'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.
517	00:28:47	00:28:49	We need to figure this out.
518	00:28:49	00:28:51	We don't even have a murder weapon yet.
519	00:28:51	00:28:53	And there are so many suspects still in play.
520	00:28:53	00:28:55	What are we missing? We're missing something.
521	00:28:55	00:28:57	What is this?
522	00:28:57	00:28:59	What's the white substance on the coach's forehead?
523	00:28:59	00:29:01	It's a biological, but that's about it.
524	00:29:01	00:29:05	Henry ran a quant, and there wasn't sufficient DNA to even generate a profile.
525	00:29:05	00:29:08	What about Trace?
526	00:29:08	00:29:10	Um, Hodges, I asked you a question.
527	00:29:10	00:29:13	Yes. And I heard you.
528	00:29:15	00:29:17	Struck out again.
529	00:29:19	00:29:21	Okay, uh... what did you ask me?
530	00:29:21	00:29:22	The dried substance?
531	00:29:22	00:29:24	Oh.
532	00:29:24	00:29:25	Yeah. It's all in there.
533	00:29:25	00:29:28	I know you were counting on semen.
534	00:29:28	00:29:30	It was a teardrop?
535	00:29:30	00:29:33	Not just any teardrop-- an emotional one.
536	00:29:33	00:29:35	An emotional teardrop? Seriously?
537	00:29:35	00:29:37	I mean, how can you even tell that? That's...
538	00:29:37	00:29:38	Science.
539	00:29:38	00:29:43	Emotional tears have a different composition than irritant-induced tears.
540	00:29:43	00:29:50	Emotional tears exhibit 25% higher concentrations in proteins, enzymes, lipids, lysozymes, and electrolytes.
541	00:29:50	00:29:52	So, someone cried over the victim.
542	00:29:52	00:29:54	I'm not sure how that helps us.
543	00:29:54	00:29:57	Refer to page four.
544	00:29:57	00:30:05	Perhaps the owner of our tear was not only mourning Coach Burns, but also mourning a lost vigor of lash.
545	00:30:05	00:30:07	Tear contained bimatoprost?
546	00:30:07	00:30:12	A synthetic prostaglandin and a key component in a prescription drug that helps promote eyelash growth.
547	00:30:12	00:30:14	Longessa.
548	00:30:14	00:30:17	Does that help you? Yes, it does. Thank you.
549	00:30:26	00:30:27	Damn it.
550	00:30:27	00:30:29	You ever think maybe not a shoe?
551	00:30:34	00:30:35	I hate you.
552	00:30:44	00:30:46	What's this? Longessa.
553	00:30:46	00:30:49	Found a six-month supply when we searched the Burns' home.
554	00:30:49	00:30:50	Eyelash ointment.
555	00:30:50	00:30:51	Uh-huh.
556	00:30:51	00:30:54	Prescribed to Mrs. Burns.
557	00:30:54	00:30:57	You know that dried substance that we found on the coach's forehead?
558	00:30:57	00:31:00	Well, turns out it was a tear with traces of Longessa.
559	00:31:00	00:31:04	That puts the wife in the shower, standing over her dead husband's body.
560	00:31:04	00:31:06	Question is, who was she with?
561	00:31:06	00:31:09	Well, I checked the Burns' cell phone records.
562	00:31:09	00:31:13	There's a consistent pattern of calls between Mrs. Burns and Jack Oxford.
563	00:31:13	00:31:15	Oxford? Mm.
564	00:31:15	00:31:16	WLVU's favorite booster?
565	00:31:16	00:31:20	Well, maybe he was boosting something else.
566	00:31:20	00:31:24	Oxford sleeping with the coach's wife, but the coach has his own thing going on with Vanessa.
567	00:31:24	00:31:26	Everybody should be happy.
568	00:31:26	00:31:27	In theory.
569	00:31:27	00:31:31	But, uh, simple math gets complicated sometimes, when passions are involved.
570	00:31:31	00:31:33	Okay, I'll call Brass.
571	00:31:33	00:31:36	I think it's time we talk to the booster and the widow.
572	00:31:36	00:31:40	Go get 'em.
573	00:31:40	00:31:42	Jim?
574	00:31:42	00:31:43	Yeah, Nick, I hear you.
575	00:31:43	00:31:47	I'll send some officers to Burns' house to pick up his wife.
576	00:31:47	00:31:53	But as far as grabbing Jack Oxford and taking him to the station, that's not gonna happen.
577	00:31:53	00:31:55	Somebody took him out of the game.
578	00:32:00	00:32:01	Ouch. That's a one-and-one.
579	00:32:01	00:32:03	Must have been in the penalty.
580	00:32:03	00:32:06	Two shots fired from a gun registered to you.
581	00:32:06	00:32:09	Recovered from a trash can right outside the gym.
582	00:32:09	00:32:11	So, thanks for making our job so easy.
583	00:32:11	00:32:17	To put a bullet in a guy's manhood-- good luck with a jury.
584	00:32:17	00:32:19	You sure you don't want to call your lawyer now?
585	00:32:19	00:32:22	I don't need a lawyer, because I haven't done anything wrong.
586	00:32:22	00:32:24	In the eyes of God?
587	00:32:24	00:32:26	I don't think so.
588	00:32:26	00:32:28	State of Nevada looks pretty bad too.
589	00:32:28	00:32:31	Phone calls between you and Oxford.
590	00:32:31	00:32:35	DNA from his house puts you in his bed.
591	00:32:35	00:32:38	Now, as far as your husband's murder...
592	00:32:38	00:32:41	Shoes from your closet match shoe impressions from the scene.
593	00:32:41	00:32:45	And Trace report says that you shed a tear over his body.
594	00:32:45	00:32:46	How touching.
595	00:32:46	00:32:47	And incriminating.
596	00:32:47	00:32:49	I didn't kill anyone.
597	00:32:51	00:32:54	But I was there at the gym that morning.
598	00:32:54	00:32:57	Yes, I was having an affair with Oxford.
599	00:32:57	00:32:59	It was just a fling.
600	00:32:59	00:33:02	I knew Tom was seeking...
601	00:33:02	00:33:04	professional company with that woman.
602	00:33:04	00:33:08	For a while, it worked for both of us.
603	00:33:08	00:33:09	And then...
604	00:33:09	00:33:10	it didn't.
605	00:33:10	00:33:15	That morning, we were supposed to get coffee and talk about mending what was broken.
606	00:33:15	00:33:18	I went looking for him in the locker room.
607	00:33:18	00:33:19	I heard the shower running.
608	00:33:19	00:33:21	That's when I saw him.
609	00:33:28	00:33:30	Well, it's a good thing you called the cops.
610	00:33:30	00:33:31	Oh...
611	00:33:31	00:33:34	wait a minute, sorry-- my bad--you didn't.
612	00:33:34	00:33:37	No, instead you made up a story about being in Tahoe.
613	00:33:37	00:33:40	I shouldn't have lied. The thing is, I knew who did it.
614	00:33:40	00:33:42	At least I thought I did.
615	00:33:42	00:33:44	I couldn't bear the scandal.
616	00:33:44	00:33:45	What are you talking about?
617	00:33:45	00:33:47	Oxford was furious with Tom.
618	00:33:47	00:33:48	They'd had a number of confrontations.
619	00:33:48	00:33:50	Over you?
620	00:33:50	00:33:51	No, over his son Eli.
621	00:33:51	00:33:54	He was trying to get him on the team--Tom refused.
622	00:33:54	00:33:56	Said some things money couldn't buy.
623	00:33:57	00:33:59	That's a good story.
624	00:33:59	00:34:03	Especially since Jack Oxford and your husband are both dead.
625	00:34:03	00:34:05	Dead men tell no tales.
626	00:34:06	00:34:08	I'm telling you the truth.
627	00:34:08	00:34:10	And I'm telling you, you really should call your lawyer now.
628	00:34:12	00:34:13	Hey, boss!
629	00:34:13	00:34:17	I heard that, uh, Mrs. Burns just got booked.
630	00:34:17	00:34:20	So I guess my travails in high heels and crocodile tears paid off?
631	00:34:20	00:34:28	Yeah, the D.A.'s going forward but Mrs. Burns is claiming that Oxford killed her husband, and then someone shot Oxford using her gun.
632	00:34:28	00:34:29	Sounds pretty thin.
633	00:34:29	00:34:31	Except for the fact that...
634	00:34:31	00:34:32	her gun was wiped clean.
635	00:34:32	00:34:38	We still don't know what was used to bludgeon the coach to death, so, forensically, we can't place either weapon in her hand.
636	00:34:38	00:34:40	So it's back to you--your...
637	00:34:40	00:34:43	travails yield anything on our mystery impressions?
638	00:34:43	00:34:45	I'm still working on it.
639	00:34:45	00:34:51	I have eliminated all shoe possibilities and all other sundry and slightly repulsive locker room possibilities.
640	00:34:51	00:34:52	So, back to work.
641	00:34:52	00:34:54	Oh, hey, um...
642	00:34:54	00:34:58	for what it's worth, I knew Charlie had nothing to do with this.
643	00:34:58	00:35:00	Thank you. Mm-hmm.
644	00:35:01	00:35:03	Okay...
645	00:35:07	00:35:09	Hey.
646	00:35:09	00:35:11	That was a good day.
647	00:35:11	00:35:12	Proud day.
648	00:35:12	00:35:14	First game as a starter.
649	00:35:16	00:35:18	Rumors are all over campus.
650	00:35:18	00:35:21	About Coach, his wife, Jack Oxford.
651	00:35:21	00:35:24	T.J. says the program's screwed.
652	00:35:24	00:35:27	Some of the players are starting to get calls from other schools.
653	00:35:29	00:35:31	Are you getting calls?
654	00:35:31	00:35:32	A couple.
655	00:35:32	00:35:35	Okay.
656	00:35:37	00:35:38	What are you gonna do?
657	00:35:39	00:35:41	What do you think I should do?
658	00:35:41	00:35:43	Not the question.
659	00:35:43	00:35:45	I know you're pissed off at me, Dad.
660	00:35:46	00:35:50	No. I'm not pissed, Charlie. I'm--I'm...
661	00:35:50	00:35:51	disappointed, that's all.
662	00:35:54	00:35:57	All right, I think we need to talk about Vanessa.
663	00:35:57	00:36:01	Why bother? She broke up with me out of the blue.
664	00:36:01	00:36:03	And said she got a job at another school.
665	00:36:03	00:36:07	One day, we're madly in love, moving in together, and the next day she's gone.
666	00:36:09	00:36:12	What is it you always say?
667	00:36:12	00:36:14	Wisdom comes through struggle.
668	00:36:15	00:36:17	Well, that's easy to say.
669	00:36:19	00:36:21	Think I'm gonna keep struggling here in Vegas.
670	00:36:23	00:36:27	Hell, if guys like T.J. leave, I should get some playing time, right?
671	00:36:29	00:36:31	More good days ahead.
672	00:36:31	00:36:32	Dinner Sunday?
673	00:36:32	00:36:34	Yeah, I'm in.
674	00:36:40	00:36:42	Hmm.
675	00:37:31	00:37:34	I think Russell's hunch was right.
676	00:37:34	00:37:35	Well, maybe right.
677	00:37:35	00:37:37	Least he was in the... ballpark.
678	00:37:38	00:37:40	Come on, that was a good one.
679	00:37:40	00:37:47	Based on the consistent repeating pattern, the location of the crime scene, I definitely think our mystery object is a ball.
680	00:37:47	00:37:48	Yes, but... (sighs)
681	00:37:48	00:37:50	it's not a basketball.
682	00:37:50	00:37:52	Or at least not one of these basketballs.
683	00:37:52	00:37:54	They all created tiny, dimpled patterns and...
684	00:37:54	00:37:57	rolled or bounced in a reasonably straight line.
685	00:37:57	00:38:03	Yeah, pattern at the scene was smooth, no dimples, and the path was jagged, irregular.
686	00:38:03	00:38:04	You see something?
687	00:38:07	00:38:08	Ugh.
688	00:38:08	00:38:10	I hate me right now.
689	00:38:10	00:38:12	What are you talking about?
690	00:38:12	00:38:15	This detail in the impression...
691	00:38:15	00:38:17	does it look like it could've been caused...
692	00:38:17	00:38:19	by a lace? Yeah.
693	00:38:19	00:38:21	Maybe.
694	00:38:21	00:38:22	Why?
695	00:38:23	00:38:26	A little roll down memory lane.
696	00:38:26	00:38:29	Prior to 1948, all basketballs had laces.
697	00:38:29	00:38:31	Not unlike this replica here.
698	00:38:31	00:38:37	The laces were crude, hand-stitched, and irregular shape-- didn't matter, because back then the goal was to pass, not to dribble.
699	00:38:37	00:38:39	Just roll the ball, please.
700	00:38:39	00:38:42	A little historical perspective never hurt.
701	00:38:52	00:38:54	Wow. Well, it sure looks like a match to me.
702	00:38:54	00:38:56	Same general characteristics, spacing...
703	00:38:56	00:38:58	I agree.
704	00:38:58	00:39:02	Okay, so, an antique basketball rolled through Coach Burns' blood...
705	00:39:02	00:39:03	How does that happen?
706	00:39:03	00:39:04	Don't know.
707	00:39:04	00:39:06	What we do know is...
708	00:39:06	00:39:08	that antique basketballs...
709	00:39:08	00:39:13	are often showcased on heavy, rectangular display cases like this.
710	00:39:13	00:39:15	Flat surfaces, sharp edges.
711	00:39:15	00:39:20	Would explain the two types of wound patterns that Doc found on Coach Burns' face and head.
712	00:39:20	00:39:23	I assume basketballs this old are rare. Very.
713	00:39:23	00:39:26	Can't be too many people in Vegas who own one.
714	00:39:34	00:39:38	The next time you bring your basketball to a murder, you might want to...
715	00:39:38	00:39:39	think about getting rid of it.
716	00:39:39	00:39:42	Even if it is worth 85 grand.
717	00:39:42	00:39:49	Yeah, we swabbed the ball and the display stand that we found in your office, and it came back positive for Coach Burns' blood.
718	00:39:49	00:39:53	Burns was a stubborn son of a bitch.
719	00:39:56	00:39:59	Put Jack Oxford's kid on the team.
720	00:39:59	00:40:01	I'm trying to take a damn shower here.
721	00:40:01	00:40:03	Just put him on the team, Tom.
722	00:40:03	00:40:06	Please. Who cares if he can't play? Let him ride the bench.
723	00:40:06	00:40:07	Nobody tells me who to recruit.
724	00:40:07	00:40:09	I need this, Tom.
725	00:40:09	00:40:10	Oxford's our biggest donor.
726	00:40:10	00:40:12	I'll never ask again. I promise.
727	00:40:15	00:40:18	This is one of the first basketballs ever made--1894.
728	00:40:18	00:40:21	Signed by James Naismith.
729	00:40:21	00:40:24	I want you to have it. You're pathetic, you know that?
730	00:40:24	00:40:26	Who the hell do you think you are?
731	00:40:26	00:40:27	You work for me.
732	00:40:27	00:40:29	I'm the face of this university.
733	00:40:29	00:40:30	This brand.
734	00:40:30	00:40:32	Not you. You're just some...
735	00:40:32	00:40:35	Ivy League pimp with his hand out, looking for cash.
736	00:40:37	00:40:38	Now, you get the hell out here.
737	00:40:41	00:40:43	Oxford gave millions to WLVU.
738	00:40:45	00:40:48	Coach Burns got the glory, but I did all the hard work.
739	00:40:48	00:40:52	Sucking up to donors, and always having to make them happy.
740	00:40:52	00:40:54	And when they're not, they pull their cash.
741	00:40:54	00:40:55	Then it's my fault.
742	00:40:55	00:40:57	My ass on the line.
743	00:40:59	00:41:00	But Burns couldn't care less.
744	00:41:16	00:41:18	And as I was leaving, I saw Linda driving up.
745	00:41:20	00:41:24	And I knew she was having an affair with Oxford.
746	00:41:24	00:41:27	I knew she had a gun, and I needed a way out.
747	00:41:27	00:41:31	And you probably hated Jack, so killing him and setting up the wife, that's a two-fer, right?
748	00:41:31	00:41:40	So you snuck into Coach Burns' house, you stole his gun and then you shot the biggest booster in WLVU's history.
749	00:41:40	00:41:42	That's irony.
750	00:41:42	00:41:47	At least I think that's the way these academic guys put it.
751	00:41:47	00:41:52	For 20 years, I've given that school everything.
752	00:41:52	00:41:55	Given it...my life.
753	00:41:55	00:42:00	And now with a double-homicide, that very same life will belong to the state penitentiary.
754	00:42:05	00:42:07	So, did the girl love Charlie?
755	00:42:07	00:42:10	I think Charlie believed that, yeah.
756	00:42:10	00:42:12	We're going to have to tell him.
757	00:42:12	00:42:13	I know. I know.
758	00:42:15	00:42:18	Why didn't you tell me?
759	00:42:18	00:42:20	There are things that I don't talk to you about.
760	00:42:20	00:42:22	The things that I don't...
761	00:42:22	00:42:24	I don't bring home, but that was...
762	00:42:24	00:42:26	that was our deal, right?
763	00:42:28	00:42:31	Charlie is our son.
764	00:42:31	00:42:35	You owe it to me to tell me if he's in trouble.
765	00:42:36	00:42:38	You're right.
766	00:42:38	00:42:41	You need to tell me, anyway.
767	00:42:41	00:42:44	You sure you want that?
768	00:42:44	00:42:46	Given the nature of what I see every day?
769	00:42:46	00:42:49	You need to talk to me about it.
770	00:42:49	00:42:54	You think you're protecting me, but you're just trying to protect yourself.
771	00:42:54	00:42:56	And that's when we get into trouble.
772	00:42:56	00:42:58	Promise me, no more secrets.
773	00:43:01	00:43:03	I know who I married, D.B.
774	00:43:05	00:43:07	I know who I married too.
