0	00:00:28	00:00:30	Water!
1	00:01:25	00:01:26	This is Gil Grissom.
2	00:01:26	00:01:29	I'm unable to answer your call. Please leave a message.
3	00:01:29	00:01:31	(beep) Hello, Gilbert.
4	00:01:31	00:01:32	Happy anniversary.
5	00:01:32	00:01:34	Hope you're out there celebrating.
6	00:01:34	00:01:37	And it's official-- time differences really suck.
7	00:01:37	00:01:38	Uh, look, I miss you.
8	00:01:38	00:01:40	I'm going to try and call you back later.
9	00:01:40	00:01:42	It's been a while, you know, since we really caught up.
10	00:01:42	00:01:43	I love you.
11	00:01:43	00:01:46	No, I'm taking good care of myself.
12	00:01:46	00:01:49	Matter of fact, I had... I had leftover pizza for breakfast.
13	00:01:49	00:01:51	I'm kidding, honey.
14	00:01:51	00:01:55	I know you're needed up there, but I need you down here, too.
15	00:01:55	00:01:57	Love you, too, sweetheart.
16	00:01:57	00:01:58	Bye-bye.
17	00:01:58	00:02:01	Welcome to the joys of long-distance relationships.
18	00:02:01	00:02:03	Yeah. I don't know how you do it.
19	00:02:03	00:02:07	Boy, I tell you, even postmortem, this place is taking me back.
20	00:02:07	00:02:10	So you big on electronic dance music, then?
21	00:02:10	00:02:13	No, music festivals, where they play real music.
22	00:02:13	00:02:18	You know, I was actually at the original Humboldt Folklife Festival, 1972.
23	00:02:18	00:02:19	Yeah, I never heard of that.
24	00:02:21	00:02:24	Yeah, youth, wasted on the young.
25	00:02:24	00:02:27	Yeah, around here, youth is just wasted.
26	00:02:27	00:02:28	Detective Moreno.
27	00:02:28	00:02:30	Looking good there, buddy.
28	00:02:30	00:02:32	Catch you on your day off, did we?
29	00:02:32	00:02:34	No, no, no, no. I'm on the clock.
30	00:02:34	00:02:37	This is, uh, one of Vice's busiest weekends of the year.
31	00:02:37	00:02:38	What happened here?
32	00:02:38	00:02:40	We have an unknown male assailant.
33	00:02:40	00:02:41	He shot four or five rounds into the crowd.
34	00:02:41	00:02:46	Panic gave way to trampling, a couple people got grazed, and one fatality.
35	00:02:46	00:02:49	No I.D., no bracelet, either.
36	00:02:49	00:02:50	Maybe she didn't pay to get in.
37	00:02:50	00:02:52	This whole area is fenced in.
38	00:02:52	00:02:53	I'm thinking she, uh, crawled under.
39	00:02:53	00:02:56	Explains all the dirt on her clothing.
40	00:02:56	00:02:58	Single GSW to the back.
41	00:03:00	00:03:01	And exit wound.
42	00:03:01	00:03:03	Through and through.
43	00:03:03	00:03:05	(shutter clicking) David?
44	00:03:05	00:03:07	What's this pattern on her arm?
45	00:03:09	00:03:13	Looks like a standard four-plus-one.
46	00:03:13	00:03:15	Somebody grabbed hold of her pretty tight.
47	00:03:15	00:03:17	Bruises and nail gouges.
48	00:03:17	00:03:20	Whoever grabbed her is missing a couple of fingernails.
49	00:03:20	00:03:21	Any witnesses?
50	00:03:21	00:03:23	Oh, we got a whole rave full of witnesses.
51	00:03:23	00:03:24	Only problem is they're all tripping.
52	00:03:24	00:03:26	Reports range from sketchy to hallucinogenic.
53	00:03:26	00:03:30	Although a couple people did say that they saw her come in with another girl.
54	00:03:30	00:03:32	Another girl. Uh-huh.
55	00:03:32	00:03:33	What happened to her?
56	00:03:33	00:03:34	Don't know.
57	00:03:34	00:03:36	Well, hopefully, she's still running.
58	00:03:36	00:03:39	You know, this doesn't seem like a random shooting to me.
59	00:03:39	00:03:41	Think she was targeted?
60	00:03:41	00:03:42	And the other one got away.
61	00:03:42	00:03:44	Yeah, but for how long?
62	00:03:44	00:03:46	Okay, looks like that girl is our witness, then.
63	00:03:46	00:03:48	Maybe our next victim.
64	00:03:48	00:03:52	Unless we catch up with her before the shooter does.
65	00:04:39	00:04:41	Surprise, surprise.
66	00:04:41	00:04:43	You found a mushroom at a rave.
67	00:04:43	00:04:45	Uh, wrong kind of mushroom.
68	00:04:45	00:04:53	Psilocybin, the, uh, fun ones, they grow in meadows and fields, and have dark spores and little gills.
69	00:04:53	00:04:56	So you can't have any visions or talk to God if you eat that?
70	00:04:56	00:04:59	No, you eat one of these, you'll be talking to Saint Peter.
71	00:04:59	00:05:03	Agaricus, endemic to the desert region.
72	00:05:03	00:05:06	So maybe this is where our girls came from.
73	00:05:06	00:05:08	There's a whole lot of desert here in Nevada.
74	00:05:08	00:05:11	Maybe this little devil will help us narrow it down a bit.
75	00:05:36	00:05:38	What is that?
76	00:05:38	00:05:39	Nitrous oxide.
77	00:05:39	00:05:40	Hmm.
78	00:05:40	00:05:47	This tank took an incredible journey all the way from this cart carrier back over there.
79	00:05:50	00:05:55	I'm thinking one of the shooter's bullets punctured the tank, causing the N2O to blow.
80	00:05:57	00:06:03	And the pressure was so high that the metal deformed outward while the gas escaped.
81	00:06:03	00:06:08	Witnesses say the tank was breathing fire, but nitrous oxide isn't flammable.
82	00:06:08	00:06:15	Yeah, but it is a potent oxidizer, providing more oxygen than the atmosphere.
83	00:06:17	00:06:20	All it needs is a spark.
84	00:06:20	00:06:21	Raver lights up.
85	00:06:21	00:06:26	Smoke on the desert, fire in the sky.
86	00:06:28	00:06:35	I was just lighting up, my cigarette, and I heard these two bangs.
87	00:06:35	00:06:37	You know, loud. Bang! Pop! Pop!
88	00:06:37	00:06:41	And this fire comes raining down, you know, like a dragon.
89	00:06:41	00:06:46	And my hand was, like, more baked than me.
90	00:06:46	00:06:49	Dragon aside, uh, did you see the girl get shot?
91	00:06:49	00:06:51	Oh, yeah.
92	00:06:51	00:06:53	Poor little flower, yeah.
93	00:06:53	00:06:54	Was there anyone with the flower?
94	00:06:54	00:06:56	Oh, yeah.
95	00:06:56	00:06:59	John Lennon. Uh, or Kurt Cobain.
96	00:06:59	00:07:01	I could only see their aura.
97	00:07:01	00:07:04	Um, oh, you know, I got some of it on my smartphone.
98	00:07:04	00:07:05	About five megapixels.
99	00:07:05	00:07:08	Would that be better?
100	00:07:14	00:07:18	Hi. CSI Brody. What happened to your arm?
101	00:07:18	00:07:21	I was dancing, got in the way of a flying tank.
102	00:07:25	00:07:27	Since when do they let patients treat themselves?
103	00:07:27	00:07:29	Oh, well, I'm a medical intern.
104	00:07:29	00:07:32	I figured the paramedics were busy enough.
105	00:07:32	00:07:34	You do seem kind of lucid for this crowd.
106	00:07:34	00:07:37	Yeah, well, I don't drink, I don't do drugs.
107	00:07:37	00:07:39	I just came to dance off some stress.
108	00:07:39	00:07:43	If you were dancing by the tank, then you must have seen the girl get shot.
109	00:07:43	00:07:45	No. What about the shooter?
110	00:07:45	00:07:46	Sorry.
111	00:07:46	00:07:48	When I heard the shots, I hit the dirt.
112	00:07:48	00:07:49	Tried to get small.
113	00:07:49	00:07:52	Well, I'm still going to need your information.
114	00:07:54	00:07:57	Hey, uh, the girl who got shot, is she going to be okay?
115	00:08:01	00:08:10	Jane Doe, number 12-608, a malnourished female between the ages of 16 and 20.
116	00:08:10	00:08:16	C.O.D. is a single gunshot wound to the torso, perforating the heart. (door opens)
117	00:08:16	00:08:19	Victim presents evidence of persistent, chronic trauma.
118	00:08:19	00:08:27	And abrasions on the wrists consistent with ligature restraints, possibly shackles.
119	00:08:27	00:08:39	General muscular atrophy and posterior bed sores suggest victim was subjected to imprisonment for an extended period and confined to a bed or other flat surface.
120	00:08:39	00:08:40	Sexual assault?
121	00:08:40	00:08:45	There's only one reason to keep a girl shackled and on her back.
122	00:08:45	00:08:47	She was a sex slave.
123	00:08:47	00:08:54	I can count on my hand the times I've taken comfort in seeing someone on my table.
124	00:08:54	00:08:59	You know, I'm not sure I buy that whole they're in a better place angle.
125	00:08:59	00:09:03	Given her condition, I am having trouble imagining a worse place.
126	00:09:03	00:09:07	Sara, this girl has never been to a dentist or a doctor.
127	00:09:07	00:09:09	She suffered years of neglect.
128	00:09:09	00:09:11	We've both seen victims like this.
129	00:09:11	00:09:15	Even if they survive, they're never going to be made whole.
130	00:09:15	00:09:18	She should have had a chance to try.
131	00:09:20	00:09:24	Well, witnesses saw her running away from the shooter.
132	00:09:24	00:09:29	Have you considered the possibility she was running from her captor?
133	00:09:29	00:09:34	Human trafficking's a multi-billion dollar business, and if that's what this is, there may be more girls out there.
134	00:09:34	00:09:36	We know there's at least one.
135	00:09:36	00:09:40	If we can find her, maybe this little girl's death won't be for nothing.
136	00:09:43	00:09:45	How many smartphones did we collect?
137	00:09:45	00:09:49	Fifty-seven, plus a dozen clips from YouTube.
138	00:09:49	00:09:51	I hate electronic music.
139	00:09:51	00:09:52	Not today, you don't.
140	00:09:52	00:09:58	It's the only way I could sync up all these clips so we can watch our crime scene play out as a music video.
141	00:10:03	00:10:08	Now, most of the phones were turned towards the stage, so no sign of our killer.
142	00:10:13	00:10:15	Hold on.
143	00:10:15	00:10:17	Zoom in on the tank.
144	00:10:18	00:10:21	Can you get a better angle on that pink fur?
145	00:10:21	00:10:23	I have so many angles...
146	00:10:25	00:10:27	...we might as well be there.
147	00:10:34	00:10:36	Dancing stress off, my ass.
148	00:10:36	00:10:38	Kitty was dealing nitrous.
149	00:10:49	00:10:53	She tell you she was also playing doctor?
150	00:10:57	00:10:59	Amanda.
151	00:10:59	00:11:01	Didn't recognize you without your ears.
152	00:11:01	00:11:04	CSI Brody, uh... what are you doing here?
153	00:11:04	00:11:05	Can I help you with something?
154	00:11:05	00:11:06	I'm sure you can.
155	00:11:06	00:11:08	I'm looking to score some nitrous.
156	00:11:09	00:11:10	I've got rounds.
157	00:11:10	00:11:14	This is called distribution of a chemical solvent to induce euphoria.
158	00:11:14	00:11:17	It's a Class D misdemeanor, and at the very least, it's enough to lose your license.
159	00:11:17	00:11:20	It's a victimless crime, all right?
160	00:11:20	00:11:21	I wasn't hurting anybody.
161	00:11:21	00:11:24	I'm not here to debate the war on drugs.
162	00:11:24	00:11:27	You tried to help the dead girl.
163	00:11:27	00:11:29	What about her friend?
164	00:11:29	00:11:30	What about her?
165	00:11:30	00:11:33	I think you tried to help her, too.
166	00:11:35	00:11:39	Look, I don't want to lose my career for doing what I took an oath to do.
167	00:11:40	00:11:48	She was... freaked-out, she was scared, so I hid her in my car where I could take care of her injuries.
168	00:11:48	00:11:49	There were police officers everywhere.
169	00:11:49	00:11:50	You could've told someone.
170	00:11:50	00:11:52	I couldn't, all right?
171	00:11:52	00:11:54	I've been around freaked-out people before.
172	00:11:54	00:11:55	She was... she was like an animal.
173	00:11:55	00:11:57	She wouldn't talk.
174	00:11:57	00:12:01	She just kept staring at me with these wild eyes.
175	00:12:01	00:12:03	So why did she trust you?
176	00:12:03	00:12:04	I don't know.
177	00:12:04	00:12:06	Her friend was dead, and...
178	00:12:06	00:12:07	I tried to help her.
179	00:12:07	00:12:10	I guess she clung on to me because she had nobody else.
180	00:12:10	00:12:12	Where is she now?
181	00:12:14	00:12:16	No, no. She's photophobic.
182	00:12:16	00:12:18	She can't handle the light.
183	00:12:19	00:12:21	So, what was the plan?
184	00:12:21	00:12:24	You were just going to leave her in the basement forever? (sighs)
185	00:12:24	00:12:26	I was hoping she'd calm down and I could admit her.
186	00:12:31	00:12:33	See for yourself.
187	00:12:39	00:12:40	It's okay. It's okay, honey.
188	00:12:40	00:12:43	It's okay. She's here to help you.
189	00:12:43	00:12:44	My name is Morgan.
190	00:12:44	00:12:46	What's your name?
191	00:12:48	00:12:51	Do you speak English?
192	00:12:51	00:12:53	¿Habla español?
193	00:13:02	00:13:05	Oh. It's just my kit.
194	00:13:05	00:13:07	I'm with the police.
195	00:13:10	00:13:13	I need to take some samples.
196	00:13:14	00:13:16	It's just cop stuff.
197	00:13:21	00:13:23	I tell you what.
198	00:13:23	00:13:26	How about I do everything to myself first...
199	00:13:28	00:13:31	...and that way, you can see it doesn't hurt.
200	00:13:37	00:13:39	See? Not so bad.
201	00:13:39	00:13:41	Right?
202	00:13:42	00:13:45	Can I see your hands?
203	00:13:46	00:13:48	Tus manos...
204	00:13:48	00:13:50	por favor.
205	00:13:58	00:14:02	Now I need to take some DNA.
206	00:14:09	00:14:11	Doesn't hurt.
207	00:14:20	00:14:22	Want to try it?
208	00:14:39	00:14:41	Thank you.
209	00:14:42	00:14:43	Stay with her.
210	00:14:43	00:14:45	I'll be right back.
211	00:15:00	00:15:02	Russell.
212	00:15:02	00:15:04	I'm at Desert Palm.
213	00:15:04	00:15:06	I found her.
214	00:15:06	00:15:07	Our missing girl.
215	00:15:07	00:15:10	Russell...
216	00:15:10	00:15:12	they cut out her tongue.
217	00:15:16	00:15:20	Based on my examination, the bulk of her tongue has been removed.
218	00:15:20	00:15:24	The anterior margin's jagged and irregular.
219	00:15:24	00:15:25	Not a surgical removal.
220	00:15:25	00:15:30	What'd they use? If I had to guess, a household tool, pliers maybe.
221	00:15:31	00:15:34	How recent is the injury?
222	00:15:34	00:15:40	Scarring and healing suggests the removal occurred at least six months ago.
223	00:15:40	00:15:42	Does it prevent her from speaking?
224	00:15:42	00:15:46	Well, with that kind of damage, I'm afraid she's not going to be doing a lot of talking.
225	00:15:46	00:15:48	Thanks, Doc. Yeah.
226	00:15:50	00:15:55	Why the hell would somebody do something like this?
227	00:15:55	00:16:00	Power. They wanted to silence her or punish her, maybe both.
228	00:16:06	00:16:11	She has, uh... ligature scarring on her wrists and her ankles, just like the dead girl.
229	00:16:11	00:16:13	I think they were held together, but...
230	00:16:13	00:16:16	she doesn't have any signs of sexual abuse.
231	00:16:16	00:16:19	She looks to be a couple of years younger than her friend.
232	00:16:19	00:16:22	Maybe... maybe the older one was trying to protect her.
233	00:16:22	00:16:25	That's consistent with witness testimony at the rave.
234	00:16:25	00:16:30	Listen, she knows who did this to her, and it's probably the same person who shot her friend.
235	00:16:30	00:16:32	So what? She can't tell us.
236	00:16:32	00:16:36	Maybe. But she still has a voice.
237	00:16:46	00:16:48	Job interview?
238	00:16:49	00:16:50	No, my friend.
239	00:16:50	00:16:52	I was in court.
240	00:16:52	00:16:58	So, Russell said you had some information for me? The mushroom on the dead girl's sandal is Agaricus deserticola.
241	00:16:58	00:17:03	It's extremely poisonous, found in deserts of the Southwest and Northern Mexico.
242	00:17:03	00:17:04	Wow.
243	00:17:04	00:17:06	That really narrows it down.
244	00:17:06	00:17:08	Thank you very much.
245	00:17:08	00:17:11	Fear not, I've left no tongue unturned.
246	00:17:11	00:17:15	Whoa. That's a little rough, don't you think?
247	00:17:15	00:17:19	Humor is my way of dealing with the horror.
248	00:17:19	00:17:26	It's a crass and essential defense mechanism-- otherwise, I couldn't do my job, especially in cases like these.
249	00:17:26	00:17:27	Okay, uh, getting back to my job.
250	00:17:27	00:17:30	Yeah, please. It's time for a little fun fact about fungi.
251	00:17:30	00:17:33	They're like these little biological sponges.
252	00:17:33	00:17:38	Whatever's in their environment-- nutrients, toxins, elemental metals-- they absorb it all.
253	00:17:38	00:17:48	I performed micro-FTIR, and I hit pay dirt on our fungi, confirmed the results on XRF, and found a high concentration of one particular metal.
254	00:17:48	00:17:49	There's tungsten in them thar hills.
255	00:17:49	00:17:50	Tungsten.
256	00:17:50	00:17:53	Now, that's found deep underground.
257	00:17:53	00:17:56	We could be looking for a refinery here. Or...
258	00:17:56	00:17:57	a tungsten mine.
259	00:17:57	00:18:00	And there's only one in the area of the rave.
260	00:18:03	00:18:05	So, we're looking for mushrooms.
261	00:18:05	00:18:06	Yeah.
262	00:18:06	00:18:09	I got to say, you CSIs have a...
263	00:18:09	00:18:11	an interesting job.
264	00:18:11	00:18:15	Well, you seem to find one of us interesting, that's for sure.
265	00:18:15	00:18:19	Ah... okay. And how's that working out for you?
266	00:18:19	00:18:21	Let's just say Finn is, uh, different.
267	00:18:21	00:18:24	Ah, different can be good.
268	00:18:24	00:18:26	Besides, she's really hot, don't you think?
269	00:18:26	00:18:28	Oh, she's hot.
270	00:18:28	00:18:29	And cold.
271	00:18:29	00:18:30	Hey.
272	00:18:30	00:18:32	What's with the third degree?
273	00:18:32	00:18:35	Watch your step.
274	00:18:35	00:18:37	What do you mean, watch your step?
275	00:18:38	00:18:40	Mushrooms.
276	00:18:40	00:18:42	Sorry.
277	00:18:46	00:18:48	Look at that.
278	00:18:51	00:18:53	(beep) Well, if the shoe fits...
279	00:18:53	00:18:55	Good work, Cinderella.
280	00:18:55	00:19:00	Well, it's the same size and same pattern as our victim's shoe.
281	00:19:00	00:19:02	Okay, so the rave was due east, right?
282	00:19:02	00:19:04	Yeah. A couple miles that way.
283	00:19:04	00:19:07	So, where do you think the girls were coming from?
284	00:19:23	00:19:29	Well, the disturbance in the ground cover tells me the girls ran down the hill.
285	00:19:29	00:19:31	Come on, let's go.
286	00:19:34	00:19:37	There's a road right over this hill.
287	00:19:37	00:19:39	Highway 238.
288	00:19:39	00:19:43	Smugglers' Alley. I can't tell you how many busts I made on this road.
289	00:19:43	00:19:45	Ooh. You smell that?
290	00:19:45	00:19:46	Mmm, cow pies.
291	00:19:46	00:19:48	Getting homesick on me?
292	00:19:48	00:19:49	Yeah, I'm getting there.
293	00:19:49	00:19:52	We got footprints.
294	00:19:52	00:19:54	They seem to start right here in this hay and sawdust.
295	00:19:58	00:20:00	Yeah, here we go.
296	00:20:00	00:20:02	What do you got?
297	00:20:03	00:20:05	That's an R-FID tag.
298	00:20:05	00:20:09	Radio Frequency Identification used on cattle.
299	00:20:09	00:20:14	And that... looks like the last of the shoe impressions.
300	00:20:14	00:20:16	So...
301	00:20:16	00:20:20	the girls started running from here.
302	00:20:20	00:20:23	Where does this road come from again?
303	00:20:23	00:20:25	Bullhead City.
304	00:20:25	00:20:27	Look at these tire impressions.
305	00:20:27	00:20:29	Looks like a semi.
306	00:20:29	00:20:30	Yeah.
307	00:20:30	00:20:32	Could be looking at a cattle hauler.
308	00:20:32	00:20:34	And I'm thinking a lot more than that.
309	00:20:34	00:20:37	This road's notorious for drug trafficking, human trafficking, all sorts of trafficking.
310	00:20:37	00:20:43	You know, what I don't get is, if our girls are really on that truck, why stop and let them off here, right?
311	00:20:43	00:20:47	There's another set of tire impressions here.
312	00:20:47	00:20:48	That's a passenger vehicle.
313	00:20:48	00:20:50	Yeah, narrower wheelbase.
314	00:20:50	00:20:52	Looks like an accident.
315	00:20:52	00:20:54	Involving...
316	00:20:54	00:20:56	a red vehicle.
317	00:20:56	00:20:59	And the other one was blue.
318	00:20:59	00:21:00	Pieces of a headlamp here, too.
319	00:21:00	00:21:05	Okay, so we got skid marks, and the car forced the cattle hauler off the road.
320	00:21:05	00:21:07	But... what do you think, road rage?
321	00:21:07	00:21:09	(vehicle rumbling) Yeah.
322	00:21:19	00:21:24	I mean, if the truck did come to a stop, the girls could have had a chance to get away.
323	00:21:25	00:21:26	Well, if we can I.D.
324	00:21:26	00:21:31	the truck and the driver, we can find our shooter.
325	00:21:40	00:21:42	Hey, hey, it's okay.
326	00:21:42	00:21:43	You're safe.
327	00:21:43	00:21:45	You're in the hospital.
328	00:21:45	00:21:47	It's okay.
329	00:21:51	00:21:55	I know it-it seems like a scary place, but...
330	00:21:55	00:21:57	it's actually not that bad.
331	00:21:57	00:22:03	My dad was here recently, and... and he ended up okay.
332	00:22:05	00:22:07	You're going to be okay, too.
333	00:22:11	00:22:13	I don't know if you can understand me.
334	00:22:13	00:22:17	I don't know what happened to you or where you've been, but...
335	00:22:17	00:22:20	I want to help you.
336	00:22:22	00:22:24	I know why you can't talk.
337	00:22:26	00:22:29	But I-I thought maybe...
338	00:22:29	00:22:32	you could write down the answers to some of my questions.
339	00:22:32	00:22:34	Can you try writing your name?
340	00:22:37	00:22:39	What-what about your address?
341	00:22:39	00:22:42	Where-where you live? Your house?
342	00:22:43	00:22:45	Your mother's name or...
343	00:22:45	00:22:47	your father's name?
344	00:22:49	00:22:53	What about the girl you were with? Your friend?
345	00:22:53	00:22:56	Can you write her name?
346	00:23:00	00:23:03	(sighs) Um...
347	00:23:03	00:23:05	Well...
348	00:23:05	00:23:08	this is... my name.
349	00:23:10	00:23:14	Morgan Brody. That's me.
350	00:23:14	00:23:17	This is my address.
351	00:23:17	00:23:21	In Green Valley, and this is my best friend's name.
352	00:23:21	00:23:24	David Hodges. (laughs)
353	00:23:24	00:23:27	At first, I didn't like him very much.
354	00:23:27	00:23:29	He was...
355	00:23:29	00:23:31	kind of weird.
356	00:23:31	00:23:34	But, you know, he's actually a really sweet guy.
357	00:23:34	00:23:38	He's smart and... funny.
358	00:23:40	00:23:42	Our parents are dating, which is so weird.
359	00:23:44	00:23:47	Sorry. Way, way too much about me.
360	00:24:14	00:24:18	Thank you for trusting me.
361	00:24:24	00:24:26	What is this?
362	00:24:34	00:24:38	The man who killed your friend-- did he do this to you?
363	00:24:46	00:24:49	Hey. Hey.
364	00:24:49	00:24:55	I'm going to find him, and I'm going to make him pay for what he did to you.
365	00:24:55	00:24:57	I promise.
366	00:24:59	00:25:01	This is all she gave me.
367	00:25:01	00:25:04	No name, no address. Just a drawing.
368	00:25:04	00:25:06	What do you think?
369	00:25:06	00:25:10	Jail cell? Or barred window? Flowers?
370	00:25:10	00:25:12	Our girl was a prisoner.
371	00:25:12	00:25:16	Maybe this was her view of the world. Maybe this is where she was being held.
372	00:25:16	00:25:18	No, no.
373	00:25:18	00:25:19	But we may be getting closer.
374	00:25:19	00:25:22	I tracked the girls to Highway 238.
375	00:25:22	00:25:25	There was clear evidence of an accident involving a cattle hauler.
376	00:25:25	00:25:27	Cattle hauler. Yeah, yeah.
377	00:25:27	00:25:31	We found an R-FID tag at the scene.
378	00:25:31	00:25:33	Two girls, chained, caged.
379	00:25:33	00:25:35	You know, treated like cattle.
380	00:25:35	00:25:38	It's not a stretch to think the driver of the hauler is our guy.
381	00:25:38	00:25:42	Or just a delivery man who was part of something much bigger.
382	00:25:42	00:25:44	Yeah, but how do we track that down?
383	00:25:44	00:25:47	Okay, well, the truck was coming from Bullhead City.
384	00:25:47	00:25:49	We found red and blue debris from a big rig in the highway.
385	00:25:49	00:25:51	It was definitely in a fender bender.
386	00:25:51	00:25:53	So, Moreno checked with D.O.T.
387	00:25:53	00:25:59	Got a list of all red and blue cattle haulers moving through Bullhead City in the last 24 hours.
388	00:25:59	00:26:01	Got an I.D. on our murder weapon.
389	00:26:01	00:26:03	.41 Ruger Magnum.
390	00:26:03	00:26:05	Greg printed up a list of registered owners.
391	00:26:05	00:26:08	What are the odds? Two lists.
392	00:26:08	00:26:10	Oh, here we go.
393	00:26:10	00:26:14	Oliver Ruiz, El Paso, Texas.
394	00:26:14	00:26:15	Pulling him up.
395	00:26:19	00:26:21	Got a name and a face.
396	00:26:21	00:26:23	Now we just got to find him.
397	00:26:23	00:26:25	Oh, I bet he's still in the neighborhood.
398	00:26:25	00:26:28	He only half-finished the job.
399	00:26:34	00:26:36	Hey, there you are.
400	00:26:36	00:26:40	Uh, I ran the swab you gave me from the girl, the one without the tongue.
401	00:26:40	00:26:41	Sorry. You know who I mean.
402	00:26:41	00:26:43	You got a hit in Missing Persons?
403	00:26:43	00:26:47	No, not on her, and not on the dead girl, either, but I did get something. What?
404	00:26:47	00:26:50	A definite familial match.
405	00:26:50	00:26:51	The girls were related?
406	00:26:51	00:26:54	50 I did a linkage ratio.
407	00:26:54	00:26:56	Sisters?
408	00:26:56	00:26:58	That narrows down our cases quite a bit.
409	00:26:58	00:27:01	She couldn't even write. Not her name.
410	00:27:01	00:27:03	Not anything. She could only draw.
411	00:27:03	00:27:05	Tells us they were abducted as small children.
412	00:27:05	00:27:11	Our girl is between the age of 15 and 16, which means we're looking for two sisters who were abducted at least ten years ago.
413	00:27:13	00:27:14	Here's something.
414	00:27:14	00:27:18	2001, Prescott, Arizona, two sisters went missing.
415	00:27:18	00:27:21	Jacinta Flores and Rosa Flores.
416	00:27:24	00:27:27	It's hard to tell.
417	00:27:27	00:27:28	I can tell.
418	00:27:28	00:27:31	That's our girl.
419	00:27:31	00:27:36	Father told the police that the mother took off in the middle of the night with the kids and took everything.
420	00:27:36	00:27:38	Is there any theory as to where they went?
421	00:27:38	00:27:40	Mother does have family in Mexico.
422	00:27:40	00:27:43	So, mom goes south of the border.
423	00:27:43	00:27:46	Something happens to her, or-or she just unloads the girls.
424	00:27:46	00:27:48	And they end up in the sex trade.
425	00:27:48	00:27:50	Is there contact info for the father?
426	00:27:50	00:27:52	No.
427	00:27:52	00:27:54	But the investigating officer in Prescott is listed.
428	00:27:54	00:27:56	Wait a minute.
429	00:27:56	00:27:59	It looks like the father has kept in touch all these years.
430	00:27:59	00:28:03	He contacts Prescott PD every couple of weeks to follow up.
431	00:28:03	00:28:05	I'll call the IO. Thanks.
432	00:28:07	00:28:09	All right, keep me posted.
433	00:28:09	00:28:13	And hey, post that truck driver's photo up all over that hospital, okay?
434	00:28:13	00:28:15	He could show up.
435	00:28:15	00:28:16	Yeah, yeah, we're on it.
436	00:28:16	00:28:19	Hodges is working on the R-FID tag as we speak.
437	00:28:19	00:28:21	Stay tuned. What's up?
438	00:28:21	00:28:27	Uh, well, my union says that I get two 15-minute breaks and a half-hour lunch.
439	00:28:27	00:28:31	You give me something, I'll give you something back.
440	00:28:31	00:28:35	Okay. How about a story?
441	00:28:35	00:28:38	Mmm, should I lay down? Mnm, no, you're good.
442	00:28:38	00:28:41	I'm-I'm eating...
443	00:28:41	00:28:43	It's called Journey of the Mexican Cow.
444	00:28:43	00:28:45	Ow!
445	00:28:45	00:28:49	My ear has just been pierced with an R-FID tag.
446	00:28:49	00:28:51	All aboard!
447	00:28:52	00:28:59	Everything you've ever wanted to know about my so-called bovine life is encoded in my ear, which is then uploaded to a database as I cross the border.
448	00:28:59	00:29:01	I know what R-FID tags do.
449	00:29:01	00:29:03	Beep. Hola.
450	00:29:03	00:29:05	Howdy. I've just crossed.
451	00:29:05	00:29:07	Pshh.
452	00:29:07	00:29:09	Now I've reached my final destination.
453	00:29:09	00:29:12	Please tell me this story has a final destination.
454	00:29:12	00:29:20	Yes, because our cattle hauler's shipment, including our burger-on-the-hoof friend here, reached the end of the line at a feedlot in Pahrump.
455	00:29:20	00:29:22	When? This morning.
456	00:29:22	00:29:23	Oh. Give it to me.
457	00:29:28	00:29:31	Moreno. Stokes.
458	00:29:31	00:29:32	We narrowed down the search area.
459	00:29:32	00:29:34	We?
460	00:29:34	00:29:37	The truck's last known location was a feedlot in Pahrump.
461	00:29:37	00:29:40	Listen to me-- I know you wanted to catch the guy, but...
462	00:29:40	00:29:42	you did good work today.
463	00:29:42	00:29:44	You're bringing this girl home to her father.
464	00:29:44	00:29:47	What do we even tell him?
465	00:29:47	00:29:51	Um... (sighs) well, you know, he's been looking for his children for years.
466	00:29:51	00:29:53	Yeah, and now one of them's dead, and the other's...
467	00:29:53	00:29:56	Wait. Hold on. Mr. Flores? Hi.
468	00:29:56	00:29:58	I'm CSI Russell.
469	00:29:58	00:30:00	This is CSI Brody. Hi.
470	00:30:01	00:30:03	I would have been here sooner, but I was on a job.
471	00:30:03	00:30:05	HVAC replacement in Havasu.
472	00:30:05	00:30:06	They told me about Rosa.
473	00:30:06	00:30:08	I'm so sorry for your loss.
474	00:30:08	00:30:09	Where's Jacinta?
475	00:30:09	00:30:11	She's sedated.
476	00:30:11	00:30:14	The doctors say she should recover from most of her injuries.
477	00:30:14	00:30:15	What do you mean, most of her injuries?
478	00:30:19	00:30:21	Sir, she's...
479	00:30:21	00:30:25	You should know Rosa did everything she could to protect her sister.
480	00:30:25	00:30:30	Jacinta has been through hell, but it could have been a lot worse.
481	00:30:30	00:30:32	She's a fighter.
482	00:30:32	00:30:36	Mr. Flores, you need to prepare yourself.
483	00:30:36	00:30:37	It's been 11 years.
484	00:30:37	00:30:39	Why? What happened to her?
485	00:30:46	00:30:48	Oh, my God.
486	00:30:52	00:30:54	Ah, that's so much time.
487	00:30:54	00:30:57	She's not a child anymore.
488	00:30:57	00:31:00	She... she's a young woman.
489	00:31:03	00:31:05	(sighs) Can I see her?
490	00:31:05	00:31:06	Actually, you know what?
491	00:31:06	00:31:10	Why-why don't we, uh... why don't we let her sleep for a little while, okay?
492	00:31:10	00:31:12	Let us buy you a cup of coffee.
493	00:31:12	00:31:13	Yeah.
494	00:31:13	00:31:15	Come on.
495	00:31:24	00:31:25	Where'd you find him?
496	00:31:25	00:31:28	I found him sleeping in his cattle hauler at a truck stop.
497	00:31:28	00:31:31	Take this piece of trash to the box.
498	00:31:32	00:31:34	I found these in the cab-- .41 Mag ammo.
499	00:31:34	00:31:36	Same caliber as the murder weapon.
500	00:31:36	00:31:37	Where's the gun?
501	00:31:37	00:31:38	Scumbag probably tossed it.
502	00:31:38	00:31:41	Who is she?
503	00:31:41	00:31:45	I found her hidden in Ruiz's truck.
504	00:31:58	00:32:00	You're safe now.
505	00:32:00	00:32:02	That guy's not going to hurt you anymore.
506	00:32:02	00:32:06	We're collecting evidence that could put him away for a very long time.
507	00:32:06	00:32:08	But we need your help.
508	00:32:08	00:32:10	We know what he did...
509	00:32:10	00:32:13	to those girls.
510	00:32:13	00:32:16	And you do, too.
511	00:32:16	00:32:19	What he did to them, he was going to do to you.
512	00:32:19	00:32:24	And he's going to do to other girls unless you...
513	00:32:24	00:32:26	You're wrong!
514	00:32:26	00:32:28	He's a good man.
515	00:32:28	00:32:30	He would never hurt anyone, ever!
516	00:32:30	00:32:31	How can you say that?
517	00:32:31	00:32:34	He's my cousin.
518	00:32:35	00:32:37	Your cousin?
519	00:32:37	00:32:39	He tried to give me a better life.
520	00:32:40	00:32:45	I-I lived in Juarez, and got caught up with bad people.
521	00:32:45	00:32:48	Ollie offered to take me north.
522	00:32:48	00:32:50	I never saw those girls before.
523	00:32:50	00:32:52	I didn't even know they were in the truck.
524	00:32:55	00:32:57	Not until the accident.
525	00:32:57	00:32:59	I felt a jolt.
526	00:32:59	00:33:01	Then I heard voices arguing.
527	00:33:04	00:33:06	That's when I saw the girls.
528	00:33:06	00:33:08	They were running.
529	00:33:08	00:33:10	They were scared.
530	00:33:10	00:33:12	It wasn't Ollie's fault.
531	00:33:12	00:33:15	The other man ran us off the road.
532	00:33:15	00:33:18	Was the other man chasing the girls?
533	00:33:26	00:33:31	Your cousin told me about the guy who ran you off the road last night.
534	00:33:31	00:33:34	Forget about all the immigration laws you've broken.
535	00:33:34	00:33:39	The ammo we found in your truck put a hole through that girl and killed her.
536	00:33:39	00:33:45	Now, if you don't start talking, you're the one that's going down for it. It's as simple as that, man.
537	00:33:45	00:33:48	Oh, yeah, Ollie...
538	00:33:48	00:33:50	if I were you, I'd listen to the man.
539	00:33:51	00:33:52	Habla.
540	00:33:56	00:33:58	I was just driving.
541	00:33:58	00:34:01	This car came out of nowhere...
542	00:34:01	00:34:03	forced me off the road.
543	00:34:03	00:34:05	This guy in a hoodie comes out acting crazy.
544	00:34:05	00:34:07	Starts telling me, Where are the girls?
545	00:34:07	00:34:09	I told him I didn't know what he was talking about.
546	00:34:09	00:34:10	Then he grabs me. I got scared.
547	00:34:10	00:34:12	I reached for the gun underneath my seat.
548	00:34:12	00:34:17	Before I can do anything with it, he ripped it out of my hand.
549	00:34:17	00:34:19	He told me he'd kill me if I talked to anyone.
550	00:34:19	00:34:22	Where did he grab you?
551	00:34:22	00:34:23	Interstate 238. Just outside...
552	00:34:23	00:34:25	No, no, no.
553	00:34:25	00:34:29	I'm talking about where on your body did he grab you?
554	00:34:35	00:34:38	Henry didn't find any secondary DNA on Ruiz's shirt.
555	00:34:38	00:34:41	I, however, did find trace amounts of a chemical.
556	00:34:41	00:34:44	R-502.
557	00:34:44	00:34:46	Very unusual, rare...
558	00:34:46	00:34:48	Mind if I just... Thank you.
559	00:34:48	00:34:52	A rare refrigerant used in air conditioning. Primarily older HVAC systems.
560	00:34:52	00:34:54	Oh, my God.
561	00:34:54	00:34:56	Is there a problem? Yeah.
562	00:34:56	00:34:57	The girl's father...
563	00:34:57	00:35:00	his business is HVAC systems.
564	00:35:04	00:35:06	Hey, D.B. What's up?
565	00:35:09	00:35:11	What?
566	00:35:19	00:35:21	Where is she?
567	00:35:21	00:35:22	Oh, well, you just missed her.
568	00:35:22	00:35:23	She was discharged.
569	00:35:23	00:35:25	Her dad said he was taking her home.
570	00:35:32	00:35:37	Why the hell would you pull your uni off the door? The girl is the victim of a predator, and you basically just sent her right back to him.
571	00:35:37	00:35:39	Are you done? You are going to be.
572	00:35:39	00:35:41	What are you going to do? Run to daddy to complain?
573	00:35:41	00:35:42	Is that all you have? No, I got a lot more...
574	00:35:42	00:35:44	Hey, Morgan. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
575	00:35:44	00:35:46	Take it easy.
576	00:35:46	00:35:48	Detective.
577	00:35:48	00:35:50	Sir. You want to walk me through this? Tell me what happened?
578	00:35:50	00:35:52	I can tell you what happened... Hey, stop.
579	00:35:52	00:35:53	Stop. (sighs)
580	00:35:53	00:35:57	What your CSI is not hearing is that the father is the legal guardian.
581	00:35:57	00:36:01	And the doctor is the one who released the girl, not me.
582	00:36:01	00:36:06	And this was at a time when our number one suspect was a cattle hauler, not the dad.
583	00:36:06	00:36:10	You called the father and actually had him brought here.
584	00:36:10	00:36:13	And I accept responsibility for that.
585	00:36:13	00:36:14	Unlike you and the rest of the...
586	00:36:14	00:36:16	Hey, hey, you know what?
587	00:36:16	00:36:17	You guys can work this out later.
588	00:36:17	00:36:19	Right now, we're dealing with a textbook sadist.
589	00:36:19	00:36:25	If you think he was taking it easy on Jacinta before, can you imagine what he's doing to her right now.
590	00:36:25	00:36:28	So can we please focus on how to find them?
591	00:36:28	00:36:29	Yes, sir. Thank you.
592	00:36:29	00:36:31	Guy's driving a blue Taurus. Arizona plates.
593	00:36:31	00:36:36	Got a broadcast out, AMBER alert, and have the PD staked out outside of his house.
594	00:36:36	00:36:38	Look, he's too smart to go home. I agree.
595	00:36:38	00:36:40	This is where he took her. This is what we have to find.
596	00:36:43	00:36:45	Yeah, yeah, that's him.
597	00:36:45	00:36:47	That's the guy who took my gun.
598	00:36:47	00:36:49	And he's the one who chased after those girls.
599	00:36:49	00:36:50	He's their old man.
600	00:36:50	00:36:51	He's been abusing them for years.
601	00:36:51	00:36:53	He used your gun to kill one of them.
602	00:36:53	00:36:56	And now he's got the other one.
603	00:36:56	00:36:58	And she's going to be dead, too, if you don't help me out here.
604	00:36:58	00:37:00	How can I help?
605	00:37:00	00:37:02	I pulled your truck log.
606	00:37:02	00:37:04	This is the route you took from Juarez to Pahrump.
607	00:37:04	00:37:06	Stopped at a weigh station in Fort Mohave.
608	00:37:06	00:37:07	The next one was Pahrump.
609	00:37:07	00:37:13	Now, between Mohave and Pahrump, your truck gained 220 pounds.
610	00:37:13	00:37:15	I thought the scales were off.
611	00:37:15	00:37:17	It must have been the girls sneaking on.
612	00:37:17	00:37:21	And did you stop anywhere between Mohave and Pahrump?
613	00:37:21	00:37:23	Yeah, yeah, I stopped to eat in Bullhead City.
614	00:37:25	00:37:27	The rave was here, off Highway 238.
615	00:37:27	00:37:29	Tungsten mine is three miles away.
616	00:37:29	00:37:31	And Bullhead City is here.
617	00:37:31	00:37:37	Which is where the girls got on the truck. We know they were traveling on foot. And they couldn't have gotten more than a couple miles.
618	00:37:37	00:37:40	So wherever the father was holding them had to be in the area, right?
619	00:37:40	00:37:42	So we're looking around here.
620	00:37:44	00:37:45	Which is still a needle in a sandbox.
621	00:37:45	00:37:48	Except we do know what we're looking for.
622	00:37:48	00:37:50	Jacinta drew it for me.
623	00:37:50	00:37:52	Flowers.
624	00:37:52	00:37:55	I just see a whole lot of desert.
625	00:37:55	00:37:57	Maybe we're looking for a house.
626	00:37:57	00:37:58	You know, with a garden.
627	00:37:59	00:38:01	Or a farm.
628	00:38:01	00:38:03	One that's harvesting wind.
629	00:38:05	00:38:08	Maybe Jacinta wasn't drawing flowers.
630	00:38:23	00:38:25	You know this is all your fault?
631	00:38:26	00:38:28	You got your sister killed.
632	00:38:30	00:38:32	She was a good girl.
633	00:38:32	00:38:35	She didn't mouth off to me, like you.
634	00:38:35	00:38:37	But we took care of that, didn't we?
635	00:38:52	00:38:55	Nah, false alarm.
636	00:38:55	00:38:58	You think someone's going to come for you?
637	00:38:59	00:39:01	It didn't have to be like this.
638	00:39:03	00:39:05	But you ran away.
639	00:39:05	00:39:06	Right? Hmm?
640	00:39:06	00:39:10	You're the one who broke up this family!
641	00:39:10	00:39:12	And for what, huh?
642	00:39:12	00:39:14	Look where you are now.
643	00:39:14	00:39:17	You're back home with me.
644	00:39:17	00:39:20	I am the only one who ever loved you.
645	00:39:38	00:39:41	Don't move, or I will turn you to pink mist!
646	00:39:41	00:39:43	On your knees!
647	00:39:43	00:39:45	I smell gasoline.
648	00:39:47	00:39:50	Drop the lighter.
649	00:39:51	00:39:53	Drop the lighter!
650	00:39:58	00:40:00	Jacinta!
651	00:40:00	00:40:01	Morgan, stop!
652	00:40:01	00:40:03	Jacinta!
653	00:40:03	00:40:05	Where's the key?
654	00:40:05	00:40:07	Morgan!
655	00:40:07	00:40:09	Search him. He's got a key.
656	00:40:09	00:40:11	See if he's got a key on him.
657	00:40:16	00:40:18	Don't worry. It's going to be okay.
658	00:40:18	00:40:22	All right? All right, we're going to get you out of here. You're going to be fine.
659	00:40:23	00:40:25	Let's help you up.
660	00:40:25	00:40:28	Let's go. We got you.
661	00:40:28	00:40:30	Relax, huh?
662	00:40:32	00:40:34	All right? Yeah.
663	00:40:34	00:40:35	Watch your head, okay?
664	00:40:35	00:40:37	Wouldn't want to hurt you.
665	00:40:41	00:40:43	You know, for a CSI...
666	00:40:43	00:40:45	you make a pretty good cop.
667	00:40:45	00:40:49	Today, I think that honor goes to our friend over there.
668	00:40:51	00:40:54	No doubt.
669	00:40:55	00:40:57	Your father told the police that...
670	00:40:57	00:41:01	your mother ran off with you and your sister to Mexico.
671	00:41:04	00:41:06	He lied.
672	00:41:12	00:41:13	Is your mother dead?
673	00:41:16	00:41:18	She found out what he was doing to Rosa?
674	00:41:21	00:41:24	And you were next?
675	00:41:27	00:41:28	Rosa wasn't going to let that happen.
676	00:41:28	00:41:32	She was going to get you as far away from him as she could.
677	00:41:44	00:41:46	Your sister saved your life.
678	00:41:58	00:42:00	It's over.
679	00:42:02	00:42:04	You're safe now.
