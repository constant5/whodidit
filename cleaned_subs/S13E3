1,00:00:28,00:00:30,GIRL: Water!
2,00:00:30,00:00:32,(crowd cheering)
3,00:00:45,00:00:48,(grunting)
4,00:00:58,00:01:00,(whimpering)
5,00:01:14,00:01:15,(gunshots)
6,00:01:15,00:01:18,(screaming)
7,00:01:18,00:01:20,(explosive whooshing)
8,00:01:20,00:01:21,(cheering)
9,00:01:25,00:01:26,(recording): This is Gil Grissom.
10,00:01:26,00:01:29,I'm unable to answer your call. Please leave a message.
11,00:01:29,00:01:31,"(beep) Hello, Gilbert."
12,00:01:31,00:01:32,Happy anniversary.
13,00:01:32,00:01:34,Hope you're out there celebrating.
14,00:01:34,00:01:37,And it's official-- time differences really suck.
15,00:01:37,00:01:38,"Uh, look, I miss you."
16,00:01:38,00:01:40,I'm going to try and call you back later.
17,00:01:40,00:01:42,"It's been a while, you know, since we really caught up."
18,00:01:42,00:01:43,I love you.
19,00:01:43,00:01:46,"No, I'm taking good care of myself."
20,00:01:46,00:01:49,"Matter of fact, I had... I had leftover pizza for breakfast."
21,00:01:49,00:01:51,"I'm kidding, honey."
22,00:01:51,00:01:55,"I know you're needed up there, but I need you down here, too."
23,00:01:55,00:01:57,"Love you, too, sweetheart."
24,00:01:57,00:01:58,Bye-bye.
25,00:01:58,00:02:01,Welcome to the joys of long-distance relationships.
26,00:02:01,00:02:03,Yeah. I don't know how you do it.
27,00:02:03,00:02:07,"Boy, I tell you, even postmortem, this place is taking me back."
28,00:02:07,00:02:10,"So you big on electronic dance music, then?"
29,00:02:10,00:02:13,"No, music festivals, where they play real music."
30,00:02:13,00:02:18,"You know, I was actually at the original Humboldt Folklife Festival, 1972."
31,00:02:18,00:02:19,"Yeah, I never heard of that."
32,00:02:19,00:02:21,(scoffs)
33,00:02:21,00:02:24,"Yeah, youth, wasted on the young."
34,00:02:24,00:02:27,"Yeah, around here, youth is just wasted."
35,00:02:27,00:02:28,Detective Moreno.
36,00:02:28,00:02:30,"Looking good there, buddy."
37,00:02:30,00:02:32,"Catch you on your day off, did we?"
38,00:02:32,00:02:34,"No, no, no, no. I'm on the clock."
39,00:02:34,00:02:37,"This is, uh, one of Vice's busiest weekends of the year."
40,00:02:37,00:02:38,SIDLE: What happened here?
41,00:02:38,00:02:40,We have an unknown male assailant.
42,00:02:40,00:02:41,He shot four or five rounds into the crowd.
43,00:02:41,00:02:46,"Panic gave way to trampling, a couple people got grazed, and one fatality."
44,00:02:46,00:02:49,"No I.D., no bracelet, either."
45,00:02:49,00:02:50,Maybe she didn't pay to get in.
46,00:02:50,00:02:52,This whole area is fenced in.
47,00:02:52,00:02:53,"I'm thinking she, uh, crawled under."
48,00:02:53,00:02:56,Explains all the dirt on her clothing.
49,00:02:56,00:02:58,MORENO: Single GSW to the back.
50,00:03:00,00:03:01,And exit wound.
51,00:03:01,00:03:03,Through and through.
52,00:03:03,00:03:05,(shutter clicking) David?
53,00:03:05,00:03:07,What's this pattern on her arm?
54,00:03:09,00:03:13,PHILLIPS: Looks like a standard four-plus-one.
55,00:03:13,00:03:15,Somebody grabbed hold of her pretty tight.
56,00:03:15,00:03:17,Bruises and nail gouges.
57,00:03:17,00:03:20,Whoever grabbed her is missing a couple of fingernails.
58,00:03:20,00:03:21,Any witnesses?
59,00:03:21,00:03:23,"Oh, we got a whole rave full of witnesses."
60,00:03:23,00:03:24,Only problem is they're all tripping.
61,00:03:24,00:03:26,Reports range from sketchy to hallucinogenic.
62,00:03:26,00:03:30,Although a couple people did say that they saw her come in with another girl.
63,00:03:30,00:03:32,Another girl. Uh-huh.
64,00:03:32,00:03:33,What happened to her?
65,00:03:33,00:03:34,Don't know.
66,00:03:34,00:03:36,"Well, hopefully, she's still running."
67,00:03:36,00:03:39,"You know, this doesn't seem like a random shooting to me."
68,00:03:39,00:03:41,Think she was targeted?
69,00:03:41,00:03:42,And the other one got away.
70,00:03:42,00:03:44,"Yeah, but for how long?"
71,00:03:44,00:03:46,"Okay, looks like that girl is our witness, then."
72,00:03:46,00:03:48,Maybe our next victim.
73,00:03:48,00:03:52,Unless we catch up with her before the shooter does.
74,00:04:28,00:04:30,"(indistinct chatter, radio communication)"
75,00:04:37,00:04:39,(shutter clicking)
76,00:04:39,00:04:41,"FINLAY: Surprise, surprise."
77,00:04:41,00:04:43,You found a mushroom at a rave.
78,00:04:43,00:04:45,"Uh, wrong kind of mushroom."
79,00:04:45,00:04:53,"Psilocybin, the, uh, fun ones, they grow in meadows and fields, and have dark spores and little gills."
80,00:04:53,00:04:56,So you can't have any visions or talk to God if you eat that?
81,00:04:56,00:04:59,"No, you eat one of these, you'll be talking to Saint Peter."
82,00:04:59,00:05:03,"Genus: Agaricus, endemic to the desert region."
83,00:05:03,00:05:06,So maybe this is where our girls came from.
84,00:05:06,00:05:08,There's a whole lot of desert here in Nevada.
85,00:05:08,00:05:11,Maybe this little devil will help us narrow it down a bit.
86,00:05:11,00:05:13,(whimpering) (gunshot)
87,00:05:17,00:05:19,(shutter clicking)
88,00:05:36,00:05:38,What is that?
89,00:05:38,00:05:39,Nitrous oxide.
90,00:05:39,00:05:40,Hmm.
91,00:05:40,00:05:47,This tank took an incredible journey all the way from this cart carrier back over there.
92,00:05:50,00:05:55,"I'm thinking one of the shooter's bullets punctured the tank, causing the N2O to blow."
93,00:05:55,00:05:57,(hollow clanging)
94,00:05:57,00:06:03,And the pressure was so high that the metal deformed outward while the gas escaped.
95,00:06:03,00:06:08,"Witnesses say the tank was breathing fire, but nitrous oxide isn't flammable."
96,00:06:08,00:06:15,"Yeah, but it is a potent oxidizer, providing more oxygen than the atmosphere."
97,00:06:17,00:06:20,All it needs is a spark.
98,00:06:20,00:06:21,Raver lights up.
99,00:06:21,00:06:35,"""Smoke on the desert, fire in the sky."" I was just lighting up, my cigarette, and I heard these two bangs."
100,00:06:35,00:06:37,"You know, loud. Bang! Pop! Pop!"
101,00:06:37,00:06:41,"And this fire comes raining down, you know, like a dragon."
102,00:06:41,00:06:46,"And my hand was, like, more baked than me."
103,00:06:46,00:06:49,"Dragon aside, uh, did you see the girl get shot?"
104,00:06:49,00:06:51,"Oh, yeah."
105,00:06:51,00:06:53,"Poor little flower, yeah."
106,00:06:53,00:06:56,"Was there anyone with the ""flower?"" Oh, yeah."
107,00:06:56,00:06:59,"John Lennon. Uh, or Kurt Cobain."
108,00:06:59,00:07:01,I could only see their aura.
109,00:07:01,00:07:04,"Um, oh, you know, I got some of it on my smartphone."
110,00:07:04,00:07:05,About five megapixels.
111,00:07:05,00:07:08,Would that be better?
112,00:07:08,00:07:10,(phone beeping)
113,00:07:10,00:07:12,(helicopter flying overhead)
114,00:07:14,00:07:18,Hi. CSI Brody. What happened to your arm?
115,00:07:18,00:07:21,"I was dancing, got in the way of a flying tank."
116,00:07:25,00:07:27,Since when do they let patients treat themselves?
117,00:07:27,00:07:29,"Oh, well, I'm a medical intern."
118,00:07:29,00:07:32,I figured the paramedics were busy enough.
119,00:07:32,00:07:34,You do seem kind of lucid for this crowd.
120,00:07:34,00:07:37,"Yeah, well, I don't drink, I don't do drugs."
121,00:07:37,00:07:39,I just came to dance off some stress.
122,00:07:39,00:07:43,"If you were dancing by the tank, then you must have seen the girl get shot."
123,00:07:43,00:07:45,No. What about the shooter?
124,00:07:45,00:07:46,Sorry.
125,00:07:46,00:07:48,"When I heard the shots, I hit the dirt."
126,00:07:48,00:07:49,Tried to get small.
127,00:07:49,00:07:52,"Well, I'm still going to need your information."
128,00:07:54,00:07:57,"Hey, uh, the girl who got shot, is she going to be okay?"
129,00:08:01,00:08:10,"Jane Doe, number 12-608, a malnourished female between the ages of 16 and 20."
130,00:08:10,00:08:16,"C.O.D. is a single gunshot wound to the torso, perforating the heart. (door opens)"
131,00:08:16,00:08:19,"Victim presents evidence of persistent, chronic trauma."
132,00:08:19,00:08:27,"And abrasions on the wrists consistent with ligature restraints, possibly shackles."
133,00:08:27,00:08:39,General muscular atrophy and posterior bed sores suggest victim was subjected to imprisonment for an extended period and confined to a bed or other flat surface.
134,00:08:39,00:08:40,Sexual assault?
135,00:08:40,00:08:45,There's only one reason to keep a girl shackled and on her back.
136,00:08:45,00:08:47,She was a sex slave.
137,00:08:47,00:08:54,I can count on my hand the times I've taken comfort in seeing someone on my table.
138,00:08:54,00:08:59,"You know, I'm not sure I buy that whole ""they're in a better place"" angle."
139,00:08:59,00:09:03,"Given her condition, I am having trouble imagining a worse place."
140,00:09:03,00:09:07,"Sara, this girl has never been to a dentist or a doctor."
141,00:09:07,00:09:09,She suffered years of neglect.
142,00:09:09,00:09:11,We've both seen victims like this.
143,00:09:11,00:09:15,"Even if they survive, they're never going to be made whole."
144,00:09:15,00:09:18,She should have had a chance to try.
145,00:09:20,00:09:24,"Well, witnesses saw her running away from the shooter."
146,00:09:24,00:09:29,Have you considered the possibility she was running from her captor?
147,00:09:29,00:09:34,"Human trafficking's a multi-billion dollar business, and if that's what this is, there may be more girls out there."
148,00:09:34,00:09:36,We know there's at least one.
149,00:09:36,00:09:40,"If we can find her, maybe this little girl's death won't be for nothing."
150,00:09:43,00:09:45,BRODY: How many smartphones did we collect?
151,00:09:45,00:09:49,"SANDERS: Fifty-seven, plus a dozen clips from YouTube."
152,00:09:49,00:09:51,I hate electronic music.
153,00:09:51,00:09:52,"Not today, you don't."
154,00:09:52,00:09:58,It's the only way I could sync up all these clips so we can watch our crime scene play out as a music video.
155,00:10:01,00:10:03,(electronic music blaring)
156,00:10:03,00:10:08,"Now, most of the phones were turned towards the stage, so no sign of our killer."
157,00:10:13,00:10:15,Hold on.
158,00:10:15,00:10:17,Zoom in on the tank.
159,00:10:18,00:10:21,Can you get a better angle on that pink fur?
160,00:10:21,00:10:23,I have so many angles...
161,00:10:25,00:10:27,...we might as well be there.
162,00:10:27,00:10:29,"(crowd cheering, music pumping)"
163,00:10:33,00:10:34,(gas hissing)
164,00:10:34,00:10:36,"BRODY: Dancing stress off, my ass."
165,00:10:36,00:10:38,Kitty was dealing nitrous.
166,00:10:38,00:10:40,(gunshots)
167,00:10:40,00:10:41,(metal clanging)
168,00:10:41,00:10:43,(nitrous tank hissing)
169,00:10:43,00:10:46,(explosive whooshing)
170,00:10:49,00:10:53,SANDERS: She tell you she was also playing doctor?
171,00:10:57,00:10:59,Amanda.
172,00:10:59,00:11:01,Didn't recognize you without your ears.
173,00:11:01,00:11:04,"CSI Brody, uh... what are you doing here?"
174,00:11:04,00:11:05,Can I help you with something?
175,00:11:05,00:11:06,I'm sure you can.
176,00:11:06,00:11:08,I'm looking to score some nitrous.
177,00:11:09,00:11:10,I've got rounds.
178,00:11:10,00:11:14,This is called distribution of a chemical solvent to induce euphoria.
179,00:11:14,00:11:17,"It's a Class D misdemeanor, and at the very least, it's enough to lose your license."
180,00:11:17,00:11:20,"It's a victimless crime, all right?"
181,00:11:20,00:11:21,I wasn't hurting anybody.
182,00:11:21,00:11:24,I'm not here to debate the war on drugs.
183,00:11:24,00:11:27,You tried to help the dead girl.
184,00:11:27,00:11:29,What about her friend?
185,00:11:29,00:11:30,What about her?
186,00:11:30,00:11:33,"I think you tried to help her, too."
187,00:11:35,00:11:39,"Look, I don't want to lose my career for doing what I took an oath to do."
188,00:11:40,00:11:48,"She was... freaked-out, she was scared, so I hid her in my car where I could take care of her injuries."
189,00:11:48,00:11:49,There were police officers everywhere.
190,00:11:49,00:11:50,You could've told someone.
191,00:11:50,00:11:52,"I couldn't, all right?"
192,00:11:52,00:11:54,I've been around freaked-out people before.
193,00:11:54,00:11:55,She was... she was like an animal.
194,00:11:55,00:11:57,She wouldn't talk.
195,00:11:57,00:12:01,She just kept staring at me with these wild eyes.
196,00:12:01,00:12:03,So why did she trust you?
197,00:12:03,00:12:04,I don't know.
198,00:12:04,00:12:06,"Her friend was dead, and..."
199,00:12:06,00:12:07,I tried to help her.
200,00:12:07,00:12:10,I guess she clung on to me because she had nobody else.
201,00:12:10,00:12:12,Where is she now?
202,00:12:14,00:12:16,"No, no. She's photophobic."
203,00:12:16,00:12:18,She can't handle the light.
204,00:12:18,00:12:19,(laughs softly)
205,00:12:19,00:12:21,"So, what was the plan?"
206,00:12:21,00:12:24,You were just going to leave her in the basement forever? (sighs)
207,00:12:24,00:12:26,I was hoping she'd calm down and I could admit her.
208,00:12:31,00:12:33,See for yourself.
209,00:12:39,00:12:40,"It's okay. It's okay, honey."
210,00:12:40,00:12:43,It's okay. She's here to help you.
211,00:12:43,00:12:44,My name is Morgan.
212,00:12:44,00:12:46,What's your name?
213,00:12:48,00:12:51,Do you speak English?
214,00:12:51,00:12:53,¿Habla español?
215,00:13:02,00:13:05,Oh. It's just my kit.
216,00:13:05,00:13:07,I'm with the police.
217,00:13:10,00:13:13,I need to take some samples.
218,00:13:14,00:13:16,It's just cop stuff.
219,00:13:21,00:13:23,I tell you what.
220,00:13:23,00:13:26,How about I do everything to myself first...
221,00:13:28,00:13:31,"...and that way, you can see it doesn't hurt."
222,00:13:31,00:13:32,(shutter clicks)
223,00:13:33,00:13:36,(shutter clicking)
224,00:13:37,00:13:39,See? Not so bad.
225,00:13:39,00:13:41,Right?
226,00:13:42,00:13:45,Can I see your hands?
227,00:13:46,00:13:48,Tus manos...
228,00:13:48,00:13:50,por favor.
229,00:13:57,00:13:58,(shutter clicking)
230,00:13:58,00:14:02,Now I need to take some DNA.
231,00:14:09,00:14:11,Doesn't hurt.
232,00:14:20,00:14:22,Want to try it?
233,00:14:39,00:14:41,Thank you.
234,00:14:42,00:14:43,Stay with her.
235,00:14:43,00:14:45,I'll be right back.
236,00:14:49,00:14:51,(panting quietly)
237,00:14:58,00:14:59,(beep)
238,00:15:00,00:15:02,Russell.
239,00:15:02,00:15:04,I'm at Desert Palm.
240,00:15:04,00:15:06,I found her.
241,00:15:06,00:15:07,Our missing girl.
242,00:15:07,00:15:10,(voice breaking): Russell...
243,00:15:10,00:15:12,they cut out her tongue.
244,00:15:16,00:15:20,"ROBBINS: Based on my examination, the bulk of her tongue has been removed."
245,00:15:20,00:15:24,The anterior margin's jagged and irregular.
246,00:15:24,00:15:25,Not a surgical removal.
247,00:15:25,00:15:30,"What'd they use? If I had to guess, a household tool, pliers maybe."
248,00:15:31,00:15:34,How recent is the injury?
249,00:15:34,00:15:40,ROBBINS: Scarring and healing suggests the removal occurred at least six months ago.
250,00:15:40,00:15:42,Does it prevent her from speaking?
251,00:15:42,00:15:46,"Well, with that kind of damage, I'm afraid she's not going to be doing a lot of talking."
252,00:15:46,00:15:48,"RUSSELL: Thanks, Doc. Yeah."
253,00:15:50,00:15:55,Why the hell would somebody do something like this?
254,00:15:55,00:16:00,"Power. They wanted to silence her or punish her, maybe both."
255,00:16:02,00:16:06,(long sigh)
256,00:16:06,00:16:11,"She has, uh... ligature scarring on her wrists and her ankles, just like the dead girl."
257,00:16:11,00:16:13,"I think they were held together, but..."
258,00:16:13,00:16:16,she doesn't have any signs of sexual abuse.
259,00:16:16,00:16:19,She looks to be a couple of years younger than her friend.
260,00:16:19,00:16:22,Maybe... maybe the older one was trying to protect her.
261,00:16:22,00:16:25,That's consistent with witness testimony at the rave.
262,00:16:25,00:16:30,"Listen, she knows who did this to her, and it's probably the same person who shot her friend."
263,00:16:30,00:16:32,So what? She can't tell us.
264,00:16:32,00:16:36,Maybe. But she still has a voice.
265,00:16:46,00:16:48,Job interview?
266,00:16:48,00:16:49,(chuckles)
267,00:16:49,00:16:50,"No, my friend."
268,00:16:50,00:16:52,I was in court.
269,00:16:52,00:16:58,"So, Russell said you had some information for me? The mushroom on the dead girl's sandal is Agaricus deserticola."
270,00:16:58,00:17:03,"It's extremely poisonous, found in deserts of the Southwest and Northern Mexico."
271,00:17:03,00:17:04,Wow.
272,00:17:04,00:17:06,That really narrows it down.
273,00:17:06,00:17:08,Thank you very much.
274,00:17:08,00:17:11,"Fear not, I've left no tongue unturned."
275,00:17:11,00:17:15,"Whoa. That's a little rough, don't you think?"
276,00:17:15,00:17:19,Humor is my way of dealing with the horror.
277,00:17:19,00:17:26,"It's a crass and essential defense mechanism-- otherwise, I couldn't do my job, especially in cases like these."
278,00:17:26,00:17:27,"Okay, uh, getting back to my job."
279,00:17:27,00:17:30,"Yeah, please. It's time for a little fun fact about fungi."
280,00:17:30,00:17:33,They're like these little biological sponges.
281,00:17:33,00:17:38,"Whatever's in their environment-- nutrients, toxins, elemental metals-- they absorb it all."
282,00:17:38,00:17:48,"I performed micro-FTIR, and I hit pay dirt on our fungi, confirmed the results on XRF, and found a high concentration of one particular metal."
283,00:17:48,00:17:49,There's tungsten in them thar hills.
284,00:17:49,00:17:50,Tungsten.
285,00:17:50,00:17:53,"Now, that's found deep underground."
286,00:17:53,00:17:56,We could be looking for a refinery here. Or...
287,00:17:56,00:17:57,a tungsten mine.
288,00:17:57,00:18:00,And there's only one in the area of the rave.
289,00:18:03,00:18:05,"So, we're looking for mushrooms."
290,00:18:05,00:18:06,(chuckling): Yeah.
291,00:18:06,00:18:09,"I got to say, you CSIs have a..."
292,00:18:09,00:18:11,an interesting job.
293,00:18:11,00:18:15,"Well, you seem to find one of us interesting, that's for sure."
294,00:18:15,00:18:19,Ah... okay. And how's that working out for you?
295,00:18:19,00:18:21,"Let's just say Finn is, uh, different."
296,00:18:21,00:18:24,"Ah, different can be good."
297,00:18:24,00:18:26,"Besides, she's really hot, don't you think?"
298,00:18:26,00:18:28,"Oh, she's hot."
299,00:18:28,00:18:29,And cold.
300,00:18:29,00:18:30,Hey.
301,00:18:30,00:18:32,What's with the third degree?
302,00:18:32,00:18:35,Watch your step.
303,00:18:35,00:18:37,"What do you mean, ""watch your step""?"
304,00:18:38,00:18:40,Mushrooms.
305,00:18:40,00:18:42,MORENO: Sorry.
306,00:18:46,00:18:48,Look at that.
307,00:18:51,00:18:53,"(beep) Well, if the shoe fits..."
308,00:18:53,00:18:55,"Good work, Cinderella."
309,00:18:55,00:19:00,"STOKES: Well, it's the same size and same pattern as our victim's shoe."
310,00:19:00,00:19:02,"Okay, so the rave was due east, right?"
311,00:19:02,00:19:04,Yeah. A couple miles that way.
312,00:19:04,00:19:07,"So, where do you think the girls were coming from?"
313,00:19:16,00:19:18,(beep)
314,00:19:21,00:19:23,(exhales)
315,00:19:23,00:19:29,"STOKES: Well, the disturbance in the ground cover tells me the girls ran down the hill."
316,00:19:29,00:19:31,"(distorted, echoing): Come on, let's go."
317,00:19:34,00:19:37,There's a road right over this hill.
318,00:19:37,00:19:39,Highway 238.
319,00:19:39,00:19:43,Smugglers' Alley. I can't tell you how many busts I made on this road.
320,00:19:43,00:19:45,Ooh. You smell that?
321,00:19:45,00:19:46,"Mmm, cow pies."
322,00:19:46,00:19:48,Getting homesick on me?
323,00:19:48,00:19:49,"(laughing): Yeah, I'm getting there."
324,00:19:49,00:19:52,We got footprints.
325,00:19:52,00:19:54,They seem to start right here in this hay and sawdust.
326,00:19:58,00:20:00,"Yeah, here we go."
327,00:20:00,00:20:02,What do you got?
328,00:20:03,00:20:05,That's an R-FID tag.
329,00:20:05,00:20:09,Radio Frequency Identification used on cattle.
330,00:20:09,00:20:14,And that... looks like the last of the shoe impressions.
331,00:20:14,00:20:16,So...
332,00:20:16,00:20:20,the girls started running from here.
333,00:20:20,00:20:23,Where does this road come from again?
334,00:20:23,00:20:25,Bullhead City.
335,00:20:25,00:20:27,Look at these tire impressions.
336,00:20:27,00:20:29,Looks like a semi.
337,00:20:29,00:20:30,Yeah.
338,00:20:30,00:20:32,Could be looking at a cattle hauler.
339,00:20:32,00:20:34,And I'm thinking a lot more than that.
340,00:20:34,00:20:37,"This road's notorious for drug trafficking, human trafficking, all sorts of trafficking."
341,00:20:37,00:20:43,"You know, what I don't get is, if our girls are really on that truck, why stop and let them off here, right?"
342,00:20:43,00:20:47,STOKES: There's another set of tire impressions here.
343,00:20:47,00:20:48,That's a passenger vehicle.
344,00:20:48,00:20:50,"Yeah, narrower wheelbase."
345,00:20:50,00:20:52,Looks like an accident.
346,00:20:52,00:20:54,STOKES: Involving...
347,00:20:54,00:20:56,a red vehicle.
348,00:20:56,00:20:59,And the other one was blue.
349,00:20:59,00:21:00,"Pieces of a headlamp here, too."
350,00:21:00,00:21:05,"Okay, so we got skid marks, and the car forced the cattle hauler off the road."
351,00:21:05,00:21:07,"But... what do you think, road rage?"
352,00:21:07,00:21:09,(vehicle rumbling) Yeah.
353,00:21:11,00:21:13,"(tires squeal, vehicles bump)"
354,00:21:19,00:21:24,"STOKES: I mean, if the truck did come to a stop, the girls could have had a chance to get away."
355,00:21:25,00:21:26,"Well, if we can I.D."
356,00:21:26,00:21:31,"the truck and the driver, we can find our shooter."
357,00:21:36,00:21:38,(phone ringing in distance)
358,00:21:38,00:21:40,(gasps)
359,00:21:40,00:21:42,"Hey, hey, it's okay."
360,00:21:42,00:21:43,You're safe.
361,00:21:43,00:21:45,You're in the hospital.
362,00:21:45,00:21:47,It's okay.
363,00:21:48,00:21:51,(siren wailing in distance)
364,00:21:51,00:21:55,"I know it-it seems like a scary place, but..."
365,00:21:55,00:21:57,it's actually not that bad.
366,00:21:57,00:22:03,"My dad was here recently, and... and he ended up okay."
367,00:22:05,00:22:07,"You're going to be okay, too."
368,00:22:11,00:22:13,I don't know if you can understand me.
369,00:22:13,00:22:17,"I don't know what happened to you or where you've been, but..."
370,00:22:17,00:22:20,I want to help you.
371,00:22:22,00:22:24,I know why you can't talk.
372,00:22:24,00:22:26,(sighs)
373,00:22:26,00:22:29,But I-I thought maybe...
374,00:22:29,00:22:32,you could write down the answers to some of my questions.
375,00:22:32,00:22:34,Can you try writing your name?
376,00:22:37,00:22:39,What-what about your address?
377,00:22:39,00:22:42,Where-where you live? Your house?
378,00:22:43,00:22:45,Your mother's name or...
379,00:22:45,00:22:47,your father's name?
380,00:22:49,00:22:53,What about the girl you were with? Your friend?
381,00:22:53,00:22:56,Can you write her name?
382,00:23:00,00:23:03,(sighs) Um...
383,00:23:03,00:23:05,Well...
384,00:23:05,00:23:08,this is... my name.
385,00:23:10,00:23:14,Morgan Brody. That's me.
386,00:23:14,00:23:17,This is my address.
387,00:23:17,00:23:21,"In Green Valley, and this is my best friend's name."
388,00:23:21,00:23:24,David Hodges. (laughs)
389,00:23:24,00:23:27,"At first, I didn't like him very much."
390,00:23:27,00:23:29,He was...
391,00:23:29,00:23:31,kind of weird.
392,00:23:31,00:23:34,"But, you know, he's actually a really sweet guy."
393,00:23:34,00:23:38,He's smart and... funny.
394,00:23:40,00:23:42,"Our parents are dating, which is so weird."
395,00:23:44,00:23:47,"Sorry. Way, way too much about me."
396,00:24:14,00:24:18,Thank you for trusting me.
397,00:24:24,00:24:26,What is this?
398,00:24:29,00:24:32,(sighs)
399,00:24:34,00:24:38,The man who killed your friend-- did he do this to you?
400,00:24:39,00:24:43,(quiet crying)
401,00:24:43,00:24:45,(sighs)
402,00:24:45,00:24:46,(sniffles)
403,00:24:46,00:24:49,Hey. Hey.
404,00:24:49,00:24:55,"I'm going to find him, and I'm going to make him pay for what he did to you."
405,00:24:55,00:24:57,I promise.
406,00:24:59,00:25:01,This is all she gave me.
407,00:25:01,00:25:04,"RUSSELL: No name, no address. Just a drawing."
408,00:25:04,00:25:06,What do you think?
409,00:25:06,00:25:10,Jail cell? Or barred window? Flowers?
410,00:25:10,00:25:12,Our girl was a prisoner.
411,00:25:12,00:25:16,Maybe this was her view of the world. Maybe this is where she was being held.
412,00:25:16,00:25:18,"Doesn't help us with a location, though. STOKES: No, no."
413,00:25:18,00:25:19,But we may be getting closer.
414,00:25:19,00:25:22,I tracked the girls to Highway 238.
415,00:25:22,00:25:25,There was clear evidence of an accident involving a cattle hauler.
416,00:25:25,00:25:27,"Cattle hauler. Yeah, yeah."
417,00:25:27,00:25:31,We found an R-FID tag at the scene.
418,00:25:31,00:25:33,"RUSSELL: Two girls, chained, caged."
419,00:25:33,00:25:35,"You know, treated like cattle."
420,00:25:35,00:25:38,It's not a stretch to think the driver of the hauler is our guy.
421,00:25:38,00:25:42,Or just a delivery man who was part of something much bigger.
422,00:25:42,00:25:44,"Yeah, but how do we track that down?"
423,00:25:44,00:25:47,"Okay, well, the truck was coming from Bullhead City."
424,00:25:47,00:25:49,We found red and blue debris from a big rig in the highway.
425,00:25:49,00:25:51,It was definitely in a fender bender.
426,00:25:51,00:25:53,"So, Moreno checked with D.O.T."
427,00:25:53,00:25:59,Got a list of all red and blue cattle haulers moving through Bullhead City in the last 24 hours.
428,00:25:59,00:26:01,Got an I.D. on our murder weapon.
429,00:26:01,00:26:03,.41 Ruger Magnum.
430,00:26:03,00:26:05,Greg printed up a list of registered owners.
431,00:26:05,00:26:08,What are the odds? Two lists.
432,00:26:08,00:26:10,"Oh, here we go."
433,00:26:10,00:26:15,"""Oliver Ruiz, El Paso, Texas."" Pulling him up."
434,00:26:15,00:26:19,"(keyboard keys clicking, computer beeps, trilling)"
435,00:26:19,00:26:21,SIDLE: Got a name and a face.
436,00:26:21,00:26:23,Now we just got to find him.
437,00:26:23,00:26:25,"Oh, I bet he's still in the neighborhood."
438,00:26:25,00:26:28,He only half-finished the job.
439,00:26:32,00:26:34,"(computers trilling, distant phone ringing)"
440,00:26:34,00:26:36,"Hey, there you are."
441,00:26:36,00:26:40,"Uh, I ran the swab you gave me from the girl, the one without the tongue."
442,00:26:40,00:26:41,Sorry. You know who I mean.
443,00:26:41,00:26:43,You got a hit in Missing Persons?
444,00:26:43,00:26:47,"No, not on her, and not on the dead girl, either, but I did get something. What?"
445,00:26:47,00:26:50,A definite familial match.
446,00:26:50,00:26:51,The girls were related?
447,00:26:51,00:26:53,It's a classic 25:50:25.
448,00:26:53,00:26:54,I did a linkage ratio.
449,00:26:54,00:26:56,SIDLE: Sisters?
450,00:26:56,00:26:58,That narrows down our cases quite a bit.
451,00:26:58,00:27:01,BRODY: She couldn't even write. Not her name.
452,00:27:01,00:27:03,Not anything. She could only draw.
453,00:27:03,00:27:05,Tells us they were abducted as small children.
454,00:27:05,00:27:11,"Never even been to school. BRODY: Our girl is between the age of 15 and 16, which means we're looking for two sisters who were abducted at least ten years ago."
455,00:27:11,00:27:13,(computer trilling)
456,00:27:13,00:27:14,SIDLE: Here's something.
457,00:27:14,00:27:18,"2001, Prescott, Arizona, two sisters went missing."
458,00:27:18,00:27:21,Jacinta Flores and Rosa Flores.
459,00:27:21,00:27:24,(computer chirps)
460,00:27:24,00:27:27,SANDERS: It's hard to tell.
461,00:27:27,00:27:28,I can tell.
462,00:27:28,00:27:31,That's our girl.
463,00:27:31,00:27:36,SIDLE: Father told the police that the mother took off in the middle of the night with the kids and took everything.
464,00:27:36,00:27:38,Is there any theory as to where they went?
465,00:27:38,00:27:40,SIDLE: Mother does have family in Mexico.
466,00:27:40,00:27:43,"So, mom goes south of the border."
467,00:27:43,00:27:46,"Something happens to her, or-or she just unloads the girls."
468,00:27:46,00:27:48,And they end up in the sex trade.
469,00:27:48,00:27:50,Is there contact info for the father?
470,00:27:50,00:27:52,SIDLE: No.
471,00:27:52,00:27:54,But the investigating officer in Prescott is listed.
472,00:27:54,00:27:56,Wait a minute.
473,00:27:56,00:27:59,It looks like the father has kept in touch all these years.
474,00:27:59,00:28:03,He contacts Prescott PD every couple of weeks to follow up.
475,00:28:03,00:28:05,I'll call the IO. Thanks.
476,00:28:07,00:28:09,"All right, keep me posted."
477,00:28:09,00:28:13,"And hey, post that truck driver's photo up all over that hospital, okay?"
478,00:28:13,00:28:15,He could show up.
479,00:28:15,00:28:16,"Yeah, yeah, we're on it."
480,00:28:16,00:28:19,Hodges is working on the R-FID tag as we speak.
481,00:28:19,00:28:21,Stay tuned. What's up?
482,00:28:21,00:28:27,"Uh, well, my union says that I get two 15-minute breaks and a half-hour lunch."
483,00:28:27,00:28:31,"You give me something, I'll give you something back."
484,00:28:31,00:28:35,Okay. How about a story?
485,00:28:35,00:28:38,"Mmm, should I lay down? Mnm, no, you're good."
486,00:28:38,00:28:41,I'm-I'm eating...
487,00:28:41,00:28:45,"It's called ""Journey of the Mexican Cow."" Chapter One: ""Ow!"
488,00:28:45,00:28:52,"My ear has just been pierced with an R-FID tag."" Chapter Two: ""All aboard!"" (Hodges imitates a vehicle revving)"
489,00:28:52,00:29:01,"""Everything you've ever wanted to know ""about my so-called bovine life is encoded in my ear, which is then uploaded to a database as I cross the border."" I know what R-FID tags do."
490,00:29:01,00:29:03,"""Beep. Hola."
491,00:29:03,00:29:07,"Howdy. I've just crossed."" Pshh."
492,00:29:07,00:29:12,"""Now I've reached my final destination."" Please tell me this story has a final destination."
493,00:29:12,00:29:20,"Yes, because our cattle hauler's shipment, including our burger-on-the-hoof friend here, reached the end of the line at a feedlot in Pahrump."
494,00:29:20,00:29:22,When? This morning.
495,00:29:22,00:29:23,Oh. Give it to me.
496,00:29:28,00:29:31,Moreno. Stokes.
497,00:29:31,00:29:32,We narrowed down the search area.
498,00:29:32,00:29:34,We?
499,00:29:34,00:29:37,The truck's last known location was a feedlot in Pahrump.
500,00:29:37,00:29:40,"RUSSELL: Listen to me-- I know you wanted to catch the guy, but..."
501,00:29:40,00:29:42,you did good work today.
502,00:29:42,00:29:44,You're bringing this girl home to her father.
503,00:29:44,00:29:47,What do we even tell him?
504,00:29:47,00:29:51,"Um... (sighs) well, you know, he's been looking for his children for years."
505,00:29:51,00:29:53,"Yeah, and now one of them's dead, and the other's..."
506,00:29:53,00:29:56,Wait. Hold on. Mr. Flores? Hi.
507,00:29:56,00:29:58,I'm CSI Russell.
508,00:29:58,00:30:00,This is CSI Brody. Hi.
509,00:30:01,00:30:03,"I would have been here sooner, but I was on a job."
510,00:30:03,00:30:05,HVAC replacement in Havasu.
511,00:30:05,00:30:06,They told me about Rosa.
512,00:30:06,00:30:08,I'm so sorry for your loss.
513,00:30:08,00:30:09,Where's Jacinta?
514,00:30:09,00:30:11,She's sedated.
515,00:30:11,00:30:14,The doctors say she should recover from most of her injuries.
516,00:30:14,00:30:15,"What do you mean, ""most of her injuries""?"
517,00:30:19,00:30:21,"Sir, she's..."
518,00:30:21,00:30:25,BRODY: You should know Rosa did everything she could to protect her sister.
519,00:30:25,00:30:30,"Jacinta has been through hell, but it could have been a lot worse."
520,00:30:30,00:30:32,She's a fighter.
521,00:30:32,00:30:36,"Mr. Flores, you need to prepare yourself."
522,00:30:36,00:30:37,It's been 11 years.
523,00:30:37,00:30:39,Why? What happened to her?
524,00:30:46,00:30:48,"Oh, my God."
525,00:30:49,00:30:52,(crying quietly)
526,00:30:52,00:30:54,"Ah, that's so much time."
527,00:30:54,00:30:57,She's not a child anymore.
528,00:30:57,00:31:00,She... she's a young woman.
529,00:31:02,00:31:03,(crying)
530,00:31:03,00:31:05,(sighs) Can I see her?
531,00:31:05,00:31:06,"RUSSELL: Actually, you know what?"
532,00:31:06,00:31:10,"Why-why don't we, uh... why don't we let her sleep for a little while, okay?"
533,00:31:10,00:31:12,Let us buy you a cup of coffee.
534,00:31:12,00:31:13,Yeah.
535,00:31:13,00:31:15,Come on.
536,00:31:19,00:31:21,(speaking Spanish)
537,00:31:21,00:31:22,(speaking Spanish)
538,00:31:22,00:31:24,(garbled radio transmission)
539,00:31:24,00:31:25,Where'd you find him?
540,00:31:25,00:31:28,I found him sleeping in his cattle hauler at a truck stop.
541,00:31:28,00:31:31,Take this piece of trash to the box.
542,00:31:31,00:31:32,(man grunts)
543,00:31:32,00:31:34,I found these in the cab-- .41 Mag ammo.
544,00:31:34,00:31:36,Same caliber as the murder weapon.
545,00:31:36,00:31:37,Where's the gun?
546,00:31:37,00:31:38,Scumbag probably tossed it.
547,00:31:38,00:31:41,Who is she?
548,00:31:41,00:31:45,I found her hidden in Ruiz's truck.
549,00:31:45,00:31:47,"(siren wails, garbled radio transmission)"
550,00:31:54,00:31:56,(gasps)
551,00:31:58,00:32:00,You're safe now.
552,00:32:00,00:32:02,That guy's not going to hurt you anymore.
553,00:32:02,00:32:06,We're collecting evidence that could put him away for a very long time.
554,00:32:06,00:32:08,STOKES: But we need your help.
555,00:32:08,00:32:10,We know what he did...
556,00:32:10,00:32:13,to those girls.
557,00:32:13,00:32:16,"And you do, too."
558,00:32:16,00:32:19,"What he did to them, he was going to do to you."
559,00:32:19,00:32:24,And he's going to do to other girls unless you...
560,00:32:24,00:32:26,You're wrong!
561,00:32:26,00:32:28,He's a good man.
562,00:32:28,00:32:30,"He would never hurt anyone, ever!"
563,00:32:30,00:32:31,How can you say that?
564,00:32:31,00:32:34,He's my cousin.
565,00:32:35,00:32:37,Your cousin?
566,00:32:37,00:32:39,He tried to give me a better life.
567,00:32:40,00:32:45,"I-I lived in Juarez, and got caught up with bad people."
568,00:32:45,00:32:48,Ollie offered to take me north.
569,00:32:48,00:32:50,I never saw those girls before.
570,00:32:50,00:32:52,I didn't even know they were in the truck.
571,00:32:55,00:32:57,Not until the accident.
572,00:32:57,00:32:59,I felt a jolt.
573,00:32:59,00:33:01,Then I heard voices arguing.
574,00:33:01,00:33:04,(indistinct shouting)
575,00:33:04,00:33:06,That's when I saw the girls.
576,00:33:06,00:33:08,They were running.
577,00:33:08,00:33:10,They were scared.
578,00:33:10,00:33:12,It wasn't Ollie's fault.
579,00:33:12,00:33:15,The other man ran us off the road.
580,00:33:15,00:33:18,STOKES: Was the other man chasing the girls?
581,00:33:26,00:33:31,Your cousin told me about the guy who ran you off the road last night.
582,00:33:31,00:33:34,Forget about all the immigration laws you've broken.
583,00:33:34,00:33:39,The ammo we found in your truck put a hole through that girl and killed her.
584,00:33:39,00:33:45,"Now, if you don't start talking, you're the one that's going down for it. It's as simple as that, man."
585,00:33:45,00:33:48,"Oh, yeah, Ollie..."
586,00:33:48,00:33:50,"if I were you, I'd listen to the man."
587,00:33:51,00:33:52,Habla.
588,00:33:56,00:33:58,I was just driving.
589,00:33:58,00:34:01,This car came out of nowhere...
590,00:34:01,00:34:03,forced me off the road.
591,00:34:03,00:34:05,This guy in a hoodie comes out acting crazy.
592,00:34:05,00:34:09,"Starts telling me, ""Where are the girls?"" I told him I didn't know what he was talking about."
593,00:34:09,00:34:10,Then he grabs me. I got scared.
594,00:34:10,00:34:12,I reached for the gun underneath my seat.
595,00:34:12,00:34:17,"Before I can do anything with it, he ripped it out of my hand."
596,00:34:17,00:34:19,He told me he'd kill me if I talked to anyone.
597,00:34:19,00:34:22,Where did he grab you?
598,00:34:22,00:34:23,Interstate 238. Just outside...
599,00:34:23,00:34:25,"No, no, no."
600,00:34:25,00:34:29,I'm talking about where on your body did he grab you?
601,00:34:35,00:34:38,Henry didn't find any secondary DNA on Ruiz's shirt.
602,00:34:38,00:34:41,"I, however, did find trace amounts of a chemical."
603,00:34:41,00:34:44,R-502.
604,00:34:44,00:34:46,"Very unusual, rare..."
605,00:34:46,00:34:48,Mind if I just... Thank you.
606,00:34:48,00:34:52,A rare refrigerant used in air conditioning. Primarily older HVAC systems.
607,00:34:52,00:34:54,"Oh, my God."
608,00:34:54,00:34:56,Is there a problem? Yeah.
609,00:34:56,00:34:57,The girl's father...
610,00:34:57,00:35:00,his business is HVAC systems.
611,00:35:00,00:35:03,(gunshot)
612,00:35:04,00:35:06,"Hey, D.B. What's up?"
613,00:35:09,00:35:11,What?
614,00:35:19,00:35:21,Where is she?
615,00:35:21,00:35:22,"Oh, well, you just missed her."
616,00:35:22,00:35:23,She was discharged.
617,00:35:23,00:35:25,Her dad said he was taking her home.
618,00:35:32,00:35:37,"Why the hell would you pull your uni off the door? The girl is the victim of a predator, and you basically just sent her right back to him."
619,00:35:37,00:35:39,Are you done? You are going to be.
620,00:35:39,00:35:41,What are you going to do? Run to daddy to complain?
621,00:35:41,00:35:42,"Is that all you have? No, I got a lot more..."
622,00:35:42,00:35:44,"Hey, Morgan. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
623,00:35:44,00:35:46,Take it easy.
624,00:35:46,00:35:48,Detective.
625,00:35:48,00:35:50,Sir. You want to walk me through this? Tell me what happened?
626,00:35:50,00:35:52,"I can tell you what happened... Hey, stop."
627,00:35:52,00:35:53,Stop. (sighs)
628,00:35:53,00:35:57,What your CSI is not hearing is that the father is the legal guardian.
629,00:35:57,00:36:01,"And the doctor is the one who released the girl, not me."
630,00:36:01,00:36:06,"And this was at a time when our number one suspect was a cattle hauler, not the dad."
631,00:36:06,00:36:10,You called the father and actually had him brought here.
632,00:36:10,00:36:13,And I accept responsibility for that.
633,00:36:13,00:36:14,Unlike you and the rest of the...
634,00:36:14,00:36:16,"Hey, hey, you know what?"
635,00:36:16,00:36:17,You guys can work this out later.
636,00:36:17,00:36:19,"Right now, we're dealing with a textbook sadist."
637,00:36:19,00:36:25,"If you think he was taking it easy on Jacinta before, can you imagine what he's doing to her right now."
638,00:36:25,00:36:28,So can we please focus on how to find them?
639,00:36:28,00:36:29,"Yes, sir. Thank you."
640,00:36:29,00:36:31,Guy's driving a blue Taurus. Arizona plates.
641,00:36:31,00:36:36,"Got a broadcast out, AMBER alert, and have the PD staked out outside of his house."
642,00:36:36,00:36:38,"Look, he's too smart to go home. I agree."
643,00:36:38,00:36:40,This is where he took her. This is what we have to find.
644,00:36:43,00:36:45,"OLLIE: Yeah, yeah, that's him."
645,00:36:45,00:36:47,That's the guy who took my gun.
646,00:36:47,00:36:49,And he's the one who chased after those girls.
647,00:36:49,00:36:50,He's their old man.
648,00:36:50,00:36:51,He's been abusing them for years.
649,00:36:51,00:36:53,He used your gun to kill one of them.
650,00:36:53,00:36:56,And now he's got the other one.
651,00:36:56,00:36:58,"And she's going to be dead, too, if you don't help me out here."
652,00:36:58,00:37:00,How can I help?
653,00:37:00,00:37:02,I pulled your truck log.
654,00:37:02,00:37:04,This is the route you took from Juarez to Pahrump.
655,00:37:04,00:37:06,Stopped at a weigh station in Fort Mohave.
656,00:37:06,00:37:07,The next one was Pahrump.
657,00:37:07,00:37:13,"Now, between Mohave and Pahrump, your truck gained 220 pounds."
658,00:37:13,00:37:15,I thought the scales were off.
659,00:37:15,00:37:17,It must have been the girls sneaking on.
660,00:37:17,00:37:21,And did you stop anywhere between Mohave and Pahrump?
661,00:37:21,00:37:23,"Yeah, yeah, I stopped to eat in Bullhead City."
662,00:37:25,00:37:27,"The rave was here, off Highway 238."
663,00:37:27,00:37:29,Tungsten mine is three miles away.
664,00:37:29,00:37:31,And Bullhead City is here.
665,00:37:31,00:37:37,Which is where the girls got on the truck. We know they were traveling on foot. And they couldn't have gotten more than a couple miles.
666,00:37:37,00:37:40,"So wherever the father was holding them had to be in the area, right?"
667,00:37:40,00:37:42,So we're looking around here.
668,00:37:44,00:37:45,Which is still a needle in a sandbox.
669,00:37:45,00:37:48,Except we do know what we're looking for.
670,00:37:48,00:37:50,Jacinta drew it for me.
671,00:37:50,00:37:52,Flowers.
672,00:37:52,00:37:55,I just see a whole lot of desert.
673,00:37:55,00:37:57,Maybe we're looking for a house.
674,00:37:57,00:37:58,"You know, with a garden."
675,00:37:59,00:38:01,Or a farm.
676,00:38:01,00:38:03,One that's harvesting wind.
677,00:38:05,00:38:08,Maybe Jacinta wasn't drawing flowers.
678,00:38:23,00:38:25,You know this is all your fault?
679,00:38:26,00:38:28,You got your sister killed.
680,00:38:30,00:38:32,She was a good girl.
681,00:38:32,00:38:35,"She didn't mouth off to me, like you."
682,00:38:35,00:38:37,"But we took care of that, didn't we?"
683,00:38:41,00:38:43,(helicopter blades whirring)
684,00:38:52,00:38:55,"Nah, false alarm."
685,00:38:55,00:38:58,You think someone's going to come for you?
686,00:38:59,00:39:01,It didn't have to be like this.
687,00:39:03,00:39:05,But you ran away.
688,00:39:05,00:39:06,Right? Hmm?
689,00:39:06,00:39:10,You're the one who broke up this family!
690,00:39:10,00:39:12,"And for what, huh?"
691,00:39:12,00:39:14,Look where you are now.
692,00:39:14,00:39:17,You're back home with me.
693,00:39:17,00:39:20,I am the only one who ever loved you.
694,00:39:30,00:39:32,(tires screeching)
695,00:39:37,00:39:38,(gun cocks)
696,00:39:38,00:39:41,"MORENO: Don't move, or I will turn you to pink mist!"
697,00:39:41,00:39:43,On your knees!
698,00:39:43,00:39:45,I smell gasoline.
699,00:39:47,00:39:50,STOKES: Drop the lighter.
700,00:39:50,00:39:51,(lighter clicks)
701,00:39:51,00:39:53,Drop the lighter!
702,00:39:58,00:40:00,Jacinta!
703,00:40:00,00:40:01,"STOKES: Morgan, stop!"
704,00:40:01,00:40:03,BRODY: Jacinta!
705,00:40:03,00:40:05,Where's the key?
706,00:40:05,00:40:07,STOKES: Morgan!
707,00:40:07,00:40:09,Search him. He's got a key.
708,00:40:09,00:40:11,STOKES: See if he's got a key on him.
709,00:40:16,00:40:18,Don't worry. It's going to be okay.
710,00:40:18,00:40:22,"All right? All right, we're going to get you out of here. You're going to be fine."
711,00:40:23,00:40:25,Let's help you up.
712,00:40:25,00:40:28,Let's go. We got you.
713,00:40:28,00:40:30,"Relax, huh?"
714,00:40:30,00:40:32,(indistinct radio transmission)
715,00:40:32,00:40:34,All right? Yeah.
716,00:40:34,00:40:35,"MORENO: Watch your head, okay?"
717,00:40:35,00:40:37,Wouldn't want to hurt you.
718,00:40:39,00:40:41,(sighs)
719,00:40:41,00:40:43,"You know, for a CSI..."
720,00:40:43,00:40:45,you make a pretty good cop.
721,00:40:45,00:40:49,"Today, I think that honor goes to our friend over there."
722,00:40:51,00:40:54,No doubt.
723,00:40:55,00:40:57,Your father told the police that...
724,00:40:57,00:41:01,your mother ran off with you and your sister to Mexico.
725,00:41:04,00:41:06,He lied.
726,00:41:12,00:41:13,Is your mother dead?
727,00:41:16,00:41:18,She found out what he was doing to Rosa?
728,00:41:21,00:41:24,And you were next?
729,00:41:27,00:41:28,Rosa wasn't going to let that happen.
730,00:41:28,00:41:32,She was going to get you as far away from him as she could.
731,00:41:44,00:41:46,Your sister saved your life.
732,00:41:53,00:41:56,(sighs)
733,00:41:58,00:42:00,It's over.
734,00:42:02,00:42:04,You're safe now.
