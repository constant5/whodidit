2,00:01:17,00:01:19,Grissom.
3,00:01:21,00:01:24,I'll be right there.
4,00:01:24,00:01:28,Please tell the doctor that I have to reschedule my appointment. Thanks.
5,00:01:28,00:01:30,She should be right with... you.
6,00:01:50,00:01:52,Any I.D. yet?
7,00:01:52,00:01:55,BRASS: Nothing but a blanket.
8,00:01:59,00:02:00,She live here?
9,00:02:00,00:02:01,We don't know.
10,00:02:01,00:02:03,Patrol called it in.
11,00:02:03,00:02:08,"Well, whoever she is she's not talking."
12,00:02:23,00:02:26,I think she just ratted herself out.
13,00:03:25,00:03:28,(background police radio transmissions)
14,00:04:01,00:04:03,GRISSOM: Drug use?
15,00:04:03,00:04:04,No visible track marks.
16,00:04:04,00:04:08,Tox screen came up empty except for botulin.
17,00:04:08,00:04:09,Food poisoning?
18,00:04:09,00:04:12,I'll know more when I cut open her stomach.
19,00:04:12,00:04:14,Heard about the rat.
20,00:04:14,00:04:16,Hope he didn't have any children.
21,00:04:16,00:04:21,Take a look at these tiny puncture wounds in her forehead.
22,00:04:21,00:04:24,Indicates repeated injections.
23,00:04:24,00:04:25,You sure she's homeless?
24,00:04:25,00:04:27,Sometimes I'm not sure of anything.
25,00:04:27,00:04:29,Educated guess: beautification.
26,00:04:29,00:04:31,She was injected with pig botulism.
27,00:04:31,00:04:35,Botox... the ultimate wrinkle cream.
28,00:04:35,00:04:37,How did it get into her bloodstream?
29,00:04:37,00:04:39,Bad doctor.
30,00:04:39,00:04:40,Missed the muscle.
31,00:04:40,00:04:43,Shot directly into her supratrochlear vein.
32,00:04:43,00:04:47,Amazing the advances we make in science and the primitive uses we find for them.
33,00:04:47,00:04:50,People are still animals.
34,00:04:50,00:04:52,Signs of possible torture.
35,00:04:52,00:04:53,A lot of scaring.
36,00:04:53,00:04:54,"Some old, some new."
37,00:04:54,00:04:56,What about the crater in her check?
38,00:04:56,00:05:02,The dove-tail abrasion of the margins was caused by the scraping of the handle of some weapon.
39,00:05:02,00:05:05,Tells me the blade was completely inserted-- more than once.
40,00:05:08,00:05:10,There's no ligature marks anywhere.
41,00:05:10,00:05:14,"I'd think she would need to be restrained for something like that, wouldn't you?"
42,00:05:14,00:05:17,Give me a few hours; I'll know more.
43,00:05:20,00:05:22,BROWN: Show and tell.
44,00:05:22,00:05:23,Who?
45,00:05:23,00:05:24,Showing but not telling.
46,00:05:24,00:05:26,I found a day planner in the shopping cart.
47,00:05:26,00:05:27,Mm-hmm.
48,00:05:27,00:05:29,It's written in code.
49,00:05:29,00:05:32,"""T to the third power."
50,00:05:32,00:05:39,"C 1023, minus ten OK equals zero."" Looks like ginkwork."
51,00:05:39,00:05:45,It's the kind of thing speed freaks do when they've been up for ten days straight and they've already taken apart the radio.
52,00:05:45,00:05:47,Yeah. I write everything down in shorthand.
53,00:05:47,00:05:49,You couldn't read it.
54,00:05:49,00:05:50,Shorthand?
55,00:05:50,00:05:52,Keeps things in order.
56,00:05:52,00:05:55,You're not a control freak or anything?
57,00:05:55,00:05:57,No.
58,00:05:57,00:06:00,Sara...
59,00:06:00,00:06:06,what's a homeless woman doing with a day planner and a $300 handbag?
60,00:06:06,00:06:08,That handbag costs $300?
61,00:06:08,00:06:09,Yeah.
62,00:06:10,00:06:12,How'd you know that?
63,00:06:12,00:06:14,I bought one for an ex-girlfriend once.
64,00:06:14,00:06:16,Oh.
65,00:06:18,00:06:24,"WILLOWS: Dusty, we got no hits on the fingerprints and no one fitting her description has been reported missing."
66,00:06:24,00:06:25,"Oh, she's not missing?"
67,00:06:25,00:06:27,She's in my world.
68,00:06:27,00:06:30,I'm just mirroring some good cheek on top of some bad cheek.
69,00:06:30,00:06:32,Okay.
70,00:06:32,00:06:35,I'll fix her forehead.
71,00:06:41,00:06:43,Her chin...
72,00:06:47,00:06:48,What a mess.
73,00:06:48,00:06:50,Mm-hmm.
74,00:06:50,00:06:52,I'm going to do a little cloning here.
75,00:06:55,00:06:57,She actually had a really nice complexion.
76,00:07:02,00:07:05,Perfect porcelain face.
77,00:07:05,00:07:07,What can you do about the hair?
78,00:07:07,00:07:08,It's a macro.
79,00:07:08,00:07:10,Whose hair do you want her to have?
80,00:07:10,00:07:12,Blonde? Courtney Love?
81,00:07:12,00:07:14,Sounds good to me.
82,00:07:14,00:07:17,Let's give her some eyes... blue.
83,00:07:19,00:07:21,I know her from somewhere.
84,00:07:21,00:07:22,You do?
85,00:07:22,00:07:24,Yeah.
86,00:07:25,00:07:27,Why are you showing me this?
87,00:07:27,00:07:34,"The cover girl, Ashleigh James-- she's your girl in the shopping cart."
88,00:07:34,00:07:36,P.D.'s tracking down her agency now.
89,00:07:36,00:07:38,Somebody wanted her dead.
90,00:07:40,00:07:42,They also wanted her ugly.
91,00:07:50,00:07:53,BRASS: It's called gentrification.
92,00:07:53,00:07:56,It's not doing anything to gentrify them.
93,00:07:56,00:07:57,Tell that to the mayor.
94,00:07:57,00:07:58,The landlord's on vacation.
95,00:07:59,00:08:02,It's a good thing because he's got a swimming pool in his basement.
96,00:08:02,00:08:06,"Ashleigh James apartment, tub overflowed."
97,00:08:06,00:08:07,Who turned the water off?
98,00:08:07,00:08:11,The first officer on the scene found the door open.
99,00:08:11,00:08:13,"After that, he didn't touch a thing."
100,00:08:13,00:08:14,"Yeah, what have you got?"
101,00:08:41,00:08:45,"Well, narcissus would be proud."
102,00:08:45,00:08:49,"Very much a woman, yet still a little girl."
103,00:08:55,00:08:59,I thought Doc Robbins said the victim's tox screen came back negative.
104,00:08:59,00:09:01,"No, she wasn't a user."
105,00:09:03,00:09:07,But maybe the boyfriend was.
106,00:09:10,00:09:11,Let's hope he nicked himself.
107,00:09:14,00:09:16,Smells like mint.
108,00:09:20,00:09:21,Hey.
109,00:09:22,00:09:23,Find anything?
110,00:09:24,00:09:25,No. Nothing.
111,00:09:25,00:09:26,Anything out front?
112,00:09:26,00:09:29,Just a couple of homeless guys.
113,00:09:32,00:09:34,"You, uh, you sure this is the vic's?"
114,00:09:35,00:09:37,You are what you eat.
115,00:09:41,00:09:43,(scraping)
116,00:09:51,00:09:53,Blood in the sink.
117,00:09:56,00:09:58,None on the floor.
118,00:10:05,00:10:07,Enema.
119,00:10:07,00:10:10,The secret life of women.
120,00:10:10,00:10:11,Don't generalize.
121,00:10:11,00:10:14,It's not very scientific of you.
122,00:10:14,00:10:16,You're right. I'm sorry.
123,00:10:22,00:10:23,Catherine...
124,00:10:34,00:10:36,Hey.
125,00:10:39,00:10:42,"Ooh, pretty girl."
126,00:10:44,00:10:48,Yeah. Dangerous being a pretty girl in this town.
127,00:10:51,00:10:57,"Listen to this: ""Babe, he's not good enough for you."
128,00:10:57,00:10:59,"""He doesn't have the history we do."
129,00:10:59,00:11:00,"""You mean the world to me."
130,00:11:00,00:11:05,"I know you'll live to regret this decision."" Mm."
131,00:11:14,00:11:16,(camera clicks)
132,00:12:18,00:12:21,Not exactly the victim's style.
133,00:12:24,00:12:28,What? You don't like cupcakes and candy bars?
134,00:12:28,00:12:29,"Hey, Gris!"
135,00:12:29,00:12:30,Grissom!
136,00:12:31,00:12:31,Hey!
137,00:12:32,00:12:33,Where's he going?
138,00:12:33,00:12:34,I don't know.
139,00:12:34,00:12:35,(whistles)
140,00:12:35,00:12:37,BROWN: Somewhere.
141,00:12:37,00:12:39,Come on.
142,00:13:30,00:13:33,What are you doing here?
143,00:13:33,00:13:35,Contextualizing.
144,00:13:35,00:13:37,Shopping cart in the lab is like a lion in a zoo.
145,00:13:37,00:13:39,I needed to see it in its natural habitat.
146,00:13:39,00:13:46,Question: How did Ashleigh James get from her loft to this underpass?
147,00:13:46,00:13:47,She didn't walk.
148,00:13:47,00:13:49,I'm pretty sure she was pushed.
149,00:13:58,00:13:59,Grissom...
150,00:13:59,00:14:02,Is that Ashleigh James?
151,00:14:05,00:14:07,She was under her own billboard.
152,00:14:08,00:14:09,Coincidence?
153,00:14:09,00:14:11,Somebody was making a point.
154,00:14:34,00:14:36,Hey.
155,00:14:36,00:14:37,You like crossword puzzles.
156,00:14:37,00:14:39,How are you at deciphering codes?
157,00:14:39,00:14:43,Aren't you putting the shopping cart before the horse?
158,00:14:43,00:14:46,In order to decipher a code you need to know the alphabet for the code.
159,00:14:46,00:14:50,"In order to know the alphabet, you need to know the author."
160,00:14:53,00:14:57,"So, what's the cart telling us?"
161,00:14:57,00:14:59,About the victim?
162,00:14:59,00:15:04,"Well, the victim had no relationship to the cart except for the fact that we found her in it."
163,00:15:04,00:15:08,I'm more interested in the person who used to call this cart home.
164,00:15:08,00:15:15,"Well, aside from the leather day runner and the Kate Swan bag-- which appear to be from Ashleigh James's world-- you got mostly collectibles."
165,00:15:15,00:15:18,"Newspapers, review journals,The Sun..."
166,00:15:18,00:15:20,Various editions going back several months.
167,00:15:20,00:15:28,"A couple of tennis rackets, a broom an umbrella, a pot I guess some kind of glove or something."
168,00:15:30,00:15:33,I stand corrected.
169,00:15:44,00:15:47,I have a feeling whoever owned this cart...
170,00:15:47,00:15:50,was an Ashleigh James fan.
171,00:15:53,00:15:55,Or a fanatic.
172,00:16:01,00:16:04,"Well, it looks like lover boy isn't home."
173,00:16:04,00:16:07,Maybe he wrote her a letter and left town.
174,00:16:07,00:16:10,It's trash day.
175,00:16:10,00:16:11,"I don't know, man."
176,00:16:11,00:16:13,We don't even have a warrant.
177,00:16:13,00:16:14,It's on the street.
178,00:16:15,00:16:16,It's fair game.
179,00:16:40,00:16:42,What did you find?
180,00:16:42,00:16:44,Photographic paper.
181,00:16:59,00:17:02,That's Ashleigh James.
182,00:17:15,00:17:17,(camera shutters clicking)
183,00:17:18,00:17:20,The cow says moo.
184,00:17:20,00:17:21,"I can hold my breath, I swear."
185,00:17:21,00:17:24,"Lola, if you exhale, you'll burst the bloody seams."
186,00:17:24,00:17:26,"Rod, I'm sorry. I..."
187,00:17:26,00:17:28,The fitting was two days ago.
188,00:17:28,00:17:32,Are you telling me you couldn't keep your face out of the trough for 48 hours?
189,00:17:33,00:17:36,"You want me to be your agent you better start doing your part, all right?"
190,00:17:38,00:17:39,Rod Darling?
191,00:17:40,00:17:42,Las Vegas Police.
192,00:17:42,00:17:44,"You're here about Ashleigh, right?"
193,00:17:44,00:17:45,Yeah.
194,00:17:45,00:17:47,Sorry about what happened but she wasn't a client anymore.
195,00:17:47,00:17:49,I dropped her a couple of months ago.
196,00:17:49,00:17:50,Did you forget to pack?
197,00:17:51,00:17:55,We found men's clothing and personal items at her place.
198,00:17:55,00:17:57,She was a screwed up kid looking for a father figure.
199,00:17:58,00:18:00,One minute booking a photo shoot.
200,00:18:00,00:18:03,"The next minute, she's screaming for Daddy."
201,00:18:06,00:18:06,(grunts)
202,00:18:06,00:18:07,You son of a bitch!
203,00:18:07,00:18:08,"All right, that's enough."
204,00:18:09,00:18:09,He killed her.
205,00:18:09,00:18:11,He killed her!
206,00:18:11,00:18:12,You're a psycho!
207,00:18:14,00:18:20,Rod did everything he could to make her dependent on him and only him.
208,00:18:20,00:18:22,She shut me out.
209,00:18:22,00:18:27,Is that why you tore up her photograph and tossed it in the trash?
210,00:18:27,00:18:29,"You just don't get it, do you?"
211,00:18:29,00:18:30,"No, I don't."
212,00:18:30,00:18:31,"I mean, I don't know."
213,00:18:31,00:18:34,"I care about a woman, I put her picture in a frame."
214,00:18:34,00:18:41,"Maybe put it on my desk but to tear it up and throw it in the garbage with old cole slaw that just doesn't say ""love"" to me."
215,00:18:41,00:18:53,If you were in love with an amazing woman and you knew she was throwing away everything that was amazing about her on some scum...
216,00:18:53,00:18:56,would you still want her picture on your desk?
217,00:18:56,00:18:58,What did you use to cut up the picture?
218,00:18:58,00:19:00,Same knife you were waving around at Rod?
219,00:19:01,00:19:03,The same knife you used to cut up Ashleigh's face?
220,00:19:05,00:19:08,"If you're suggesting I was sleeping with her, I wasn't."
221,00:19:08,00:19:10,You run out of drawer space in your place?
222,00:19:10,00:19:12,I was protecting my asset.
223,00:19:12,00:19:15,I don't know what that means.
224,00:19:15,00:19:16,(sighs)
225,00:19:16,00:19:21,You can't drive a mile in this town without seeing her face on a billboard on the side of a bus.
226,00:19:21,00:19:22,Up in lights.
227,00:19:22,00:19:28,The mantra in this business is you protect what's bankable in this business.
228,00:19:28,00:19:29,(clears throat)
229,00:19:29,00:19:31,So you didn't sleep with her.
230,00:19:31,00:19:36,"You just ""stayed over."" You brought a change of clothes razor blade, toothbrush, blah, blah, blah."
231,00:19:36,00:19:37,Yeah.
232,00:19:37,00:19:39,"She needed constant attention, supervision."
233,00:19:39,00:19:43,"Leave her alone for a minute, fill in the blank."
234,00:19:47,00:19:49,I got crabs.
235,00:19:49,00:19:51,Excuse me?
236,00:19:51,00:19:52,I got crabs.
237,00:19:52,00:19:55,Take a look.
238,00:19:59,00:20:00,Pthirus pubis.
239,00:20:01,00:20:02,Feeds on human blood.
240,00:20:02,00:20:09,They prefer the pubic and perianal regions because their legs are adapted to grasp hairs which are widely spaced.
241,00:20:09,00:20:11,They don't usually nest in clothing.
242,00:20:11,00:20:15,But when the clothing is being worn by someone with substandard personal hygiene...
243,00:20:16,00:20:18,Like one of the victim's neighbors.
244,00:20:18,00:20:25,We have a high-end handbag found in a street person's shopping cart a jacket covered in crabs in a closet full of designer clothes.
245,00:20:25,00:20:26,What does that tell us?
246,00:20:26,00:20:30,Tells me the victim not only had a visitor but that visitor was most likely homeless.
247,00:20:30,00:20:35,Tells me that whoever is missing a shopping cart is also missing his jacket.
248,00:21:02,00:21:05,Good stuff in here.
249,00:21:06,00:21:09,"Hey, you got a smoke?"
250,00:21:09,00:21:11,No. Sorry.
251,00:21:11,00:21:14,"So, what good are you?"
252,00:21:15,00:21:17,It depends.
253,00:21:17,00:21:19,"Ooh, hey."
254,00:21:19,00:21:23,"Don't even think that you can play me, my man."
255,00:21:23,00:21:25,I'm not playing.
256,00:21:25,00:21:28,"I've got a gal named Sara, and she would love that scarf."
257,00:21:30,00:21:31,What do you say?
258,00:21:31,00:21:34,Trade me.
259,00:21:35,00:21:37,Yeah. What the hell.
260,00:21:46,00:21:48,Hey.
261,00:21:48,00:21:50,"Hey, hey, Mister."
262,00:21:50,00:21:51,"Hey, Mister, that is Tookie's scarf."
263,00:21:51,00:21:53,That is his scarf. I gave it to him.
264,00:21:53,00:21:54,That is Tookie's.
265,00:21:54,00:21:56,"Are you a taker, or are you a giver, Mister?"
266,00:21:56,00:21:57,I'm a trader.
267,00:21:57,00:22:00,I traded Tookie my jacket for this scarf.
268,00:22:02,00:22:04,"Yeah, and fleas can tell time."
269,00:22:04,00:22:06,I think fleascantell time.
270,00:22:06,00:22:07,(muttering)
271,00:22:09,00:22:11,That's a nice ring.
272,00:22:11,00:22:14,I'll trade you.
273,00:22:18,00:22:20,"I'll trade you for kit, too."
274,00:22:27,00:22:30,Now I can see what the dark looks like.
275,00:22:30,00:22:33,I've been trying to do that for years.
276,00:22:41,00:22:43,Greg ran the blood on this scarf.
277,00:22:43,00:22:44,It matches the victim's.
278,00:22:44,00:22:45,How about the blood on the knife?
279,00:22:45,00:22:49,"Yeah, we got a match, too, but it's not the vic's."
280,00:22:49,00:22:53,"BROWN: Yeah, Mcbride clipped Rod Darling's right hand during his little hissy fit."
281,00:22:53,00:22:54,Blood's his.
282,00:22:55,00:22:59,And Mcbride's knife does not match these wounds.
283,00:23:00,00:23:03,(sighs)
284,00:23:03,00:23:07,The tools were trade. The weapons of beauty.
285,00:23:07,00:23:12,Yeah. If other people inflicted as much torture as women inflict upon themselves there would be lawsuits.
286,00:23:12,00:23:16,"Someone forgot to clean these, too, for a long time."
287,00:23:16,00:23:18,Positive for blood all over the place.
288,00:23:22,00:23:25,SANDERS: Grissom...
289,00:23:25,00:23:29,"I, uh, ran the DNA on the epithelials from the homeless lady's ring."
290,00:23:29,00:23:31,It's likePrince and the Pauper.
291,00:23:32,00:23:33,No.Princess and the Pauper.
292,00:23:33,00:23:35,The princess is a dead supermodel.
293,00:23:35,00:23:36,Yeah.
294,00:23:36,00:23:39,And her pauper sister could be the killer.
295,00:23:41,00:23:43,Hot dog?
296,00:23:49,00:23:51,Relish?
297,00:23:51,00:23:55,"Mm... with all those preservatives, no, no, no."
298,00:23:55,00:23:59,"I-I don't want to be preserved, thank you very much. No."
299,00:23:59,00:24:02,"I mean, I mean do you know what-what relish can do to your insides, huh?"
300,00:24:02,00:24:04,I'd have to investigate.
301,00:24:04,00:24:06,"Yeah, well, you know, you should."
302,00:24:06,00:24:09,"I mean, you know because our insides-- they can kill us."
303,00:24:09,00:24:11,"So, you're pretty careful about what you eat?"
304,00:24:12,00:24:17,"Yeah, you know, you-you have to be careful, you know 'cause what goes down, you know it's got to come out."
305,00:24:17,00:24:19,It's got to come up.
306,00:24:19,00:24:20,Out.
307,00:24:20,00:24:21,(chuckles)
308,00:24:21,00:24:23,Newton's theory twisted again.
309,00:24:24,00:24:26,Everybody's twisted.
310,00:24:29,00:24:31,How about your sister?
311,00:24:31,00:24:33,My-my sister didn't have a sister.
312,00:24:33,00:24:35,"Protein's good, you know?"
313,00:24:35,00:24:36,C-carbs are bad.
314,00:24:36,00:24:37,This is bad.
315,00:24:37,00:24:38,That's bad.
316,00:24:43,00:24:46,"Hey, Cassie, you know that scarf you gave Tookie?"
317,00:24:47,00:24:49,"Yeah, I know it."
318,00:24:49,00:24:52,"Did your sister give that to you, or..."
319,00:24:52,00:24:54,did you steal it from her?
320,00:24:54,00:24:58,I should have stole it.
321,00:24:58,00:25:01,Because sh-sh-she stole from me.
322,00:25:02,00:25:04,What did she steal from you?
323,00:25:04,00:25:08,My life.
324,00:25:13,00:25:15,DARLING: I admit I gave up on Cassie.
325,00:25:15,00:25:16,Washed my hands.
326,00:25:16,00:25:19,Ashleigh was the only one who still gave a damn.
327,00:25:19,00:25:22,Get together with her every couple of weeks.
328,00:25:22,00:25:25,"Make sure she had a decent meal, shower, clothes on her back."
329,00:25:25,00:25:26,And what did you do for her?
330,00:25:26,00:25:28,Let me tell you something.
331,00:25:28,00:25:30,"For every piece of meat, there has to be a butcher."
332,00:25:30,00:25:32,(scoffs)
333,00:25:32,00:25:33,"So, you led her to the slaughter?"
334,00:25:33,00:25:34,Free will.
335,00:25:34,00:25:37,Recognize this one?
336,00:25:39,00:25:42,That's Cassie.
337,00:25:42,00:25:44,It's the homeless sister.
338,00:25:44,00:25:47,How long ago was this taken?
339,00:25:47,00:25:48,Three years.
340,00:25:48,00:25:50,"See, Cassie got deep into freebase."
341,00:25:50,00:25:54,No shortage of sleazebags around to keep her supplied.
342,00:25:54,00:25:57,I knew she had the sister in Wichita Falls.
343,00:25:57,00:25:58,"All right, Cassie, let's go."
344,00:25:58,00:26:00,"Come on, chin up."
345,00:26:00,00:26:02,"Colin, will you get in there and get her hair out of her face?"
346,00:26:03,00:26:04,Don't touch me!
347,00:26:04,00:26:06,I hate this!
348,00:26:06,00:26:07,I hate this place!
349,00:26:07,00:26:08,I hate it!
350,00:26:08,00:26:09,I hate my life!
351,00:26:09,00:26:10,Get away from me!
352,00:26:10,00:26:12,(muttering)
353,00:26:19,00:26:23,One look... that was it.
354,00:26:23,00:26:25,Camera ate her up.
355,00:26:25,00:26:28,"So, in Cassie's mind, she was a victim here."
356,00:26:28,00:26:30,Makes sense that she'd be angry.
357,00:26:30,00:26:32,Angry was five flights up.
358,00:26:32,00:26:33,Cassie was an obsessed basehead.
359,00:26:33,00:26:35,Cocaine already had her paranoid.
360,00:26:35,00:26:40,Once Ashleigh started modeling everything became this big conspiracy.
361,00:26:40,00:26:43,"Naturally, yours truly was Satan."
362,00:26:43,00:26:47,Cassie threw her life away and her sister Ashleigh recycled it.
363,00:26:47,00:26:49,"GRISSOM: It's like a crossword puzzle, isn't it?"
364,00:26:49,00:26:51,"Once you pick it up, you can't put it down."
365,00:26:51,00:26:53,And go home? No way.
366,00:26:53,00:26:56,"You know, this Day Runner belonged to Ashleigh."
367,00:26:56,00:26:57,"""BFJ3""."
368,00:26:57,00:26:59,BF: Bellagio fountain.
369,00:27:02,00:27:05,J3? Date?
370,00:27:05,00:27:07,January 3rd? June 3rd? July 3rd?
371,00:27:07,00:27:09,"Uh, third ""J"" month, July?"
372,00:27:09,00:27:11,That's what I thought at first.
373,00:27:11,00:27:13,Parking space in a parking garage?
374,00:27:14,00:27:17,"Nope. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down."
375,00:27:17,00:27:19,J3... J3...
376,00:27:19,00:27:20,City or state grid map?
377,00:27:20,00:27:22,You're cold.
378,00:27:22,00:27:25,What's one thing a model always knows?
379,00:27:26,00:27:27,Who's shooting her.
380,00:27:27,00:27:28,Three Js. Jay Jay Jarrett.
381,00:27:28,00:27:30,Who?
382,00:27:30,00:27:31,Famous photographer.
383,00:27:31,00:27:35,Compliments of P.D.: Ashleigh James's employment contracts for the last year.
384,00:27:35,00:27:38,"And, as an aside she stopped working two months ago."
385,00:27:38,00:27:40,Why?
386,00:27:40,00:27:42,Good question.
387,00:27:42,00:27:43,(sighs)
388,00:27:43,00:27:46,Maybe the answer is in one of these pages.
389,00:27:51,00:27:55,"BRASS: Nobody could blame you for being mad, Cassie."
390,00:27:55,00:28:00,"I mean, your sister took your career and you wanted to get back at her."
391,00:28:00,00:28:03,"If you couldn't have success, she couldn't either."
392,00:28:03,00:28:04,Isn't that right?
393,00:28:04,00:28:08,"The v-victims have victims, too."
394,00:28:08,00:28:10,"So, which one of you is the victim?"
395,00:28:10,00:28:14,"I-I know... you know, I know, I tried to warn her."
396,00:28:14,00:28:17,About the in-in and-and outing and the... and the pick-pick.
397,00:28:18,00:28:20,And the-and the and the counting the counting and the counting.
398,00:28:20,00:28:21,"I mean, I did, I tried."
399,00:28:22,00:28:24,"That's why I tried to really, really save her."
400,00:28:24,00:28:25,"I mean, I tried to save her."
401,00:28:25,00:28:26,You tried to save her?
402,00:28:26,00:28:27,Your sister?
403,00:28:27,00:28:29,"Right. She could never be, you know..."
404,00:28:29,00:28:31,she could never be... pretty enough.
405,00:28:31,00:28:35,And she could never b-be...skinnyenough.
406,00:28:35,00:28:38,And sh-she could never be... perfect enough.
407,00:28:38,00:28:41,And sh-she could never be any-anything enough.
408,00:28:44,00:28:45,"Hey, fat girl."
409,00:28:45,00:28:48,I got what you need.
410,00:28:48,00:28:51,I got it.
411,00:28:51,00:28:52,(snorting)
412,00:28:52,00:28:55,(whimpers)
413,00:28:55,00:28:58,(murmuring)
414,00:28:58,00:28:59,One more.
415,00:29:00,00:29:02,Good girl.
416,00:29:02,00:29:03,Mm.
417,00:29:03,00:29:05,"I mean, that's why I did, I did."
418,00:29:05,00:29:07,I tried to stop her.
419,00:29:07,00:29:09,(choked up): I tried to stop her.
420,00:29:11,00:29:14,I tried to stop.
421,00:29:18,00:29:23,(whimpering)
422,00:29:23,00:29:25,BRASS: She's a needle freak.
423,00:29:26,00:29:28,She doesn't know what she's talking about.
424,00:29:28,00:29:29,"Yes, she does."
425,00:29:29,00:29:31,(moans)
426,00:29:31,00:29:34,"You tried to stop yourself, didn't you?"
427,00:29:34,00:29:35,But you couldn't.
428,00:29:35,00:29:37,(yelling incoherently)
429,00:29:37,00:29:39,It's you! It's you!
430,00:29:39,00:29:40,It's you!
431,00:29:40,00:29:42,You! You!
432,00:29:43,00:29:45,"All right, read her her rights."
433,00:29:56,00:29:59,I found blisters in the back of her throat.
434,00:29:59,00:30:01,What? Forced oral?
435,00:30:01,00:30:07,That's what I thought until I noticed worn enamel on the tooth.
436,00:30:08,00:30:12,In conjunction with this red mark on the knuckle of her middle finger.
437,00:30:12,00:30:16,Which made me realize it wasn't sexual abuse.
438,00:30:16,00:30:19,Eating disorder.
439,00:30:19,00:30:20,(gagging sound)
440,00:30:22,00:30:25,She was bulimic and anorexic.
441,00:30:25,00:30:28,Which explains the down on her skin.
442,00:30:28,00:30:30,Lanugo.
443,00:30:30,00:30:34,Characteristic of premature babies and anorexics.
444,00:30:34,00:30:36,She doesn't seem that skinny.
445,00:30:37,00:30:38,Not this week.
446,00:30:38,00:30:41,"Last week, or the week before, who knows?"
447,00:30:41,00:30:43,Binge-and-purge.
448,00:30:43,00:30:45,Till her entire system is in a state of shock.
449,00:30:45,00:30:46,You know what's next.
450,00:30:46,00:30:48,Body starts feeding on its own muscle.
451,00:30:48,00:30:50,Is that what killed her?
452,00:30:50,00:30:54,"Uh, starvation and purging weaken the immune system."
453,00:30:54,00:30:59,"But cause of death: failed kidney, fueled by septicemia."
454,00:30:59,00:31:01,Blood infection.
455,00:31:01,00:31:04,Caused by the injuries to her face?
456,00:31:04,00:31:07,"Probably, but she's been septic for at least a month."
457,00:31:07,00:31:10,She has anemia borne of chronic disease.
458,00:31:10,00:31:12,"Her red cell count's low, iron's low."
459,00:31:12,00:31:14,ESR is extremely high.
460,00:31:14,00:31:17,So she didn't just die.
461,00:31:17,00:31:19,She's been dying for a long time.
462,00:31:30,00:31:33,(knocking on door)
463,00:31:33,00:31:35,What do you know that's good?
464,00:31:37,00:31:39,Cassie James's psych profile.
465,00:31:42,00:31:45,WILLOWS: Classic paranoid schizophrenic.
466,00:31:45,00:31:48,Which explains why the interrogation room was too hard on her.
467,00:31:48,00:31:53,"For schizophrenics, you know, the tighter the space the more unbearable the feelings tend to be."
468,00:31:53,00:31:57,"Well, if you ask me that's not the only psych evaluation we need."
469,00:31:57,00:31:58,Ashleigh James?
470,00:31:58,00:31:59,(sighs): That poor girl.
471,00:31:59,00:32:03,Definitely lacking in the self-image department.
472,00:32:03,00:32:07,"She suffered from septicemia, indicative of chronic abuse."
473,00:32:07,00:32:13,But... what if Cassie wasn't the one who inflicted Ashleigh's facial wounds?
474,00:32:13,00:32:17,"Well, we know it's not the ex-boyfriend-- no evidence."
475,00:32:17,00:32:20,Not the agent-- wouldn't jeopardize an asset.
476,00:32:20,00:32:24,"And if it's not Cassie, who's left?"
477,00:32:24,00:32:26,I don't know.
478,00:32:46,00:32:47,(sighs)
479,00:32:47,00:32:51,T 3. 1834 BC.
480,00:32:52,00:32:54,48 BF.
481,00:33:16,00:33:18,T 3...
482,00:33:18,00:33:22,1834 BC...

485,00:33:38,00:33:40,1 TU.
486,00:33:46,00:33:49,You must have been so desperate.
487,00:33:51,00:33:53,Cassie James's prints from Booking on the left.
488,00:33:54,00:33:56,Prints from the loft faucet on the right.
489,00:33:56,00:33:58,Do we have a prom date?
490,00:33:58,00:34:00,(computer key clacking)
491,00:34:04,00:34:06,"All right, well..."
492,00:34:10,00:34:14,Cassie James was definitely in her sister's apartment.
493,00:34:16,00:34:19,"STOKES: Hey, man. What you eatin'?"
494,00:34:19,00:34:20,Little college cuisine.
495,00:34:21,00:34:22,"That stuff will kill you, you know."
496,00:34:22,00:34:24,Hasn't killed me yet.
497,00:34:24,00:34:27,"Grego, find any time between meals to check out Grissom's scrapings?"
498,00:34:28,00:34:30,You mean Ashleigh's fingernail scrapings?
499,00:34:30,00:34:31,Yeah. Yeah.
500,00:34:31,00:34:32,And?
501,00:34:33,00:34:34,Got a match.
502,00:34:34,00:34:36,"To Cassie, her sister."
503,00:34:36,00:34:37,No. To the vic.
504,00:34:37,00:34:38,Ashleigh?
505,00:34:39,00:34:41,Yeah. The DNA under her fingernails was her own.
506,00:34:42,00:34:43,Excuse me.
507,00:34:45,00:34:49,So what I realized was bulimia is a zero sum disease.
508,00:34:49,00:34:53,That's why she has a plus sign over here and a minus sign over there.
509,00:34:53,00:34:57,Whatever went in had to be exactly canceled by what went out.
510,00:34:57,00:35:01,You're talking about BDD: Body Dysmorphic Disorder.
511,00:35:01,00:35:04,Yes. One theory suggests it's neurobiological.
512,00:35:04,00:35:14,"Another psychological-- that people with extreme sexual or emotional anxiety unconsciously displace their feelings into the arena of appearance, because it's more manageable."
513,00:35:14,00:35:16,"You feel like crap, blame your face."
514,00:35:17,00:35:21,"Or your skin, or your hair or that zit on your forehead."
515,00:35:21,00:35:22,I knew this dancer.
516,00:35:22,00:35:26,Every night she'd stare at herself in the mirror for three hours.
517,00:35:26,00:35:31,"Meticulous grooming, when a person suffers from BDD becomes a destructive compulsion."
518,00:35:31,00:35:40,"There's one line in her daybook that keeps repeating over and over and over again: ""I'm not even."" So you're saying she knew she was slipping."
519,00:35:40,00:35:42,No. She literally means even.
520,00:35:42,00:35:46,A large number of BDD sufferers are convinced that they're not symmetric.
521,00:35:46,00:35:49,That one side of their body or their face doesn't match the other.
522,00:35:49,00:35:51,All animals prefer symmetry in their mates.
523,00:35:51,00:35:56,The male Japanese scorpion flies with the most symmetrical wings gets the most mates.
524,00:35:56,00:36:00,"BROWN: So, really we're not talking about being beautiful at all."
525,00:36:00,00:36:02,In terms of entomology being beautiful is about being even.
526,00:36:02,00:36:05,It signals the fitness to procreate.
527,00:36:05,00:36:07,"STOKES: So, we're not really talking about looks."
528,00:36:07,00:36:10,We're talking about survival of the species?
529,00:36:10,00:36:14,The bottom line is the same: control and perfectionism.
530,00:36:14,00:36:16,That's what her code was all about.
531,00:36:19,00:36:30,"Let's take ""HBWC/3, 1590 BC, 90 BF, 3930 S, 114 TC."" Three hamburgers with cheese."
532,00:36:30,00:36:31,Content 530.
533,00:36:31,00:36:35,530 times three is where she gets 1590 BC.
534,00:36:35,00:36:42,"That's BC for ""bad calories."" And at 30 grams a pop 90 grams of BF."
535,00:36:42,00:36:43,Bad fat?
536,00:36:43,00:36:44,Yeah.
537,00:36:44,00:36:50,"The rest of her formula involves sodium, total carbohydrates and the actual weight of everything she ate."
538,00:36:51,00:36:53,"And so, she was, uh..."
539,00:36:53,00:36:57,operating like a scientist seeking a perfect formula to take her pain away.
540,00:36:57,00:37:00,Or disappear altogether.
541,00:37:00,00:37:02,Which brings me to the minus side of her equation.
542,00:37:02,00:37:08,"She would write down the number of times she t'u'd, threw up, in this case twice-- or evo'd."
543,00:37:08,00:37:10,"""Evo'd""?"
544,00:37:10,00:37:12,Moving her bowels.
545,00:37:12,00:37:15,"The directions on her disposable enema box use the term ""evacuate""."
546,00:37:15,00:37:27,"So, after her burger binge she ""3 evo'd, 14 G, 2 t'u'd, 9 G, 3 #1."" She evo'd three times but her calculations didn't stop there."
547,00:37:27,00:37:29,"""G"" stands for grams."
548,00:37:36,00:37:37,14 gram... wait a minute.
549,00:37:37,00:37:39,You're telling me that she weighed her bowel?
550,00:37:40,00:37:41,WILLOWS: Yeah.
551,00:37:41,00:37:43,We bagged it.
552,00:37:47,00:37:51,SIDLE: Input and output down to the last quarter gram.
553,00:37:51,00:37:57,"Well, that makes sense why the blood and skin under Ashleigh James's fingernails is a perfect match to Ashleigh James."
554,00:37:57,00:37:59,She attacked herself.
555,00:38:00,00:38:05,"I mean, Ashleigh was convinced that everything about her needed to be fixed."
556,00:38:05,00:38:07,The real problem was inside her head.
557,00:38:07,00:38:09,She couldn't deal with that so she tried to fix the outside.
558,00:38:09,00:38:13,"Hence, the digging and picking and purging and bleeding."
559,00:38:13,00:38:14,"To us, it would be torture."
560,00:38:14,00:38:18,To her... some sort of release.
561,00:38:18,00:38:22,Which is why Rod cut her loose.
562,00:38:22,00:38:24,She was no longer bankable.
563,00:38:24,00:38:27,Also why Frank was so angry at Rod.
564,00:38:28,00:38:30,"Yeah, he destroyed Frank's vision of her."
565,00:38:30,00:38:34,So the victim and the killer became one and the same.
566,00:38:34,00:38:43,The very nature of addiction-- whether it be self-medicating herself or self-mutilating-- is that the very behavior we use to survive it becomes a behavior that ends up killing us.
567,00:38:43,00:38:50,"STOKES: But wait, that still doesn't answer how Ashleigh ended up in a shopping cart by the freeway."
568,00:38:50,00:38:53,"Well, the fingerprints explain that."
569,00:39:08,00:39:10,(crying)
570,00:39:14,00:39:17,I think Cassie was trying to take care of her sister.
571,00:39:18,00:39:21,She pushed her to a place where she thought she'd be safe.
572,00:39:21,00:39:26,Where she thought she could see herself for how beautiful she really was.
573,00:39:35,00:39:38,What happened to these girls?
574,00:39:48,00:39:52,"I'm sorry about your sister, Cassie."
575,00:39:52,00:39:54,The dead don't bleed.
576,00:39:54,00:39:58,True. Death does have some advantages.
577,00:40:00,00:40:02,Would you like me to help you get into a shelter?
578,00:40:02,00:40:04,"No, I would need a shelter from a shelter."
579,00:40:04,00:40:10,"No, no, no. Out here, I can hunt and I can range and I can find the things that I need out here."
580,00:40:10,00:40:13,"I mean, you never know what you need until you find it."
581,00:40:13,00:40:16,Or until you lose it.
582,00:40:19,00:40:23,"I mean, all we are is what we try to get rid of."
583,00:40:23,00:40:27,Fat and newspapers and loneliness and cat food cans.
584,00:40:27,00:40:32,"And there are going-away people and there are left-behind people but, you know, everybody's secrets..."
585,00:40:32,00:40:34,everybody's secrets are the same.
586,00:40:34,00:40:36,Were you and your sister's secrets the same?
587,00:40:37,00:40:38,My sister didn't have secrets.
588,00:40:38,00:40:40,Her secrets had her.
589,00:40:40,00:40:43,That... I told you I didn't... I don't know.
590,00:40:43,00:40:48,"I mean, you know, y-y-you-you can pick through a million lives and never have one of your own."
591,00:40:51,00:40:56,"Looking for things, analyzing them..."
592,00:40:56,00:41:00,trying to figure out the world-- that's a life.
593,00:41:00,00:41:03,You never know what you need until you find it.
594,00:41:03,00:41:09,And the next thing I find it might be the thing that changes everything.
595,00:41:09,00:41:13,What will you do when you find it?
596,00:41:13,00:41:16,Sleep...
597,00:41:16,00:41:19,the most perfect sleep.
598,00:41:22,00:41:25,(muttering)
599,00:42:22,00:42:22,(muted tires screeching)
600,00:42:23,00:42:24,(muted horn honking)
601,00:42:33,00:42:38,GRISSOM: Obviously most of crime scene investigation is about seeing.
602,00:42:38,00:42:40,But much of it is about hearing as well.
603,00:42:41,00:42:42,Listening.
604,00:42:42,00:42:43,Knowing how to listen.
605,00:42:43,00:42:47,Not just to what people are saying but how they say it.
606,00:42:47,00:42:53,How their tone of voice matches their facial expressions or body posture.
607,00:42:53,00:42:58,"So, even if I read lips and know what they're saying..."
608,00:42:58,00:43:01,it's not enough.
609,00:43:02,00:43:06,"We're both scientists, Mr. Grissom so let me tell you the science."
610,00:43:07,00:43:09,You've got otosclerosis.
611,00:43:10,00:43:15,"Basically, this means a bony growth has begun to form around the base of the stapes."
612,00:43:15,00:43:25,What this does is prevent the stapes from moving and passing vibrations to the inner ear effectively neutralizing sound waves.
613,00:43:25,00:43:27,It's hereditary-- my mother.
614,00:43:27,00:43:29,Most doctors think so.
615,00:43:29,00:43:36,But there's no way to know when it's going to show up and there's no way to reverse it once it does.
616,00:43:36,00:43:38,Right.
617,00:43:42,00:43:43,How long do you think?
618,00:43:45,00:43:47,I don't have that answer.
