11,00:03:34,00:03:36,I always liked the circus.
12,00:03:36,00:03:39,"Yeah, it's fun trying to figure out the magic tricks."
13,00:03:39,00:03:41,"Well, that's taking the fun out of it."
14,00:03:41,00:03:44,"Hey, the coroner's on his way."
15,00:03:44,00:03:47,"Vic's a Jane Doe, no I.D."
16,00:03:52,00:03:54,Green powder on her dress.
17,00:03:54,00:03:56,Is she with the show?
18,00:03:56,00:03:59,"According to statements, she wasn't a part of Cirque du Soleil."
19,00:03:59,00:04:02,"Well, there's plenty of surveillance."
20,00:04:02,00:04:04,"Yeah, but the body was discovered backstage."
21,00:04:04,00:04:06,What's it doing out here?
22,00:04:06,00:04:08,I think he wants to tell you.
23,00:04:08,00:04:11,"Hi. Michel Souray, company manager ofKA."
24,00:04:11,00:04:13,I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances.
25,00:04:13,00:04:15,Why'd you move the body?
26,00:04:15,00:04:18,SOURAY: Backstage can be a dangerous place if you don't know your way around.
27,00:04:18,00:04:22,So the Cirque organization made a special agreement with Clark County.
28,00:04:22,00:04:27,Any accidents that occur inside our facility are under Cirque jurisdiction.
29,00:04:27,00:04:33,Our personnel immediately transported her outside and the paramedics arrived within minutes.
30,00:04:35,00:04:41,I have no idea who the poor girl is and I know every face on our staff.
31,00:04:41,00:04:43,Watch your step.
32,00:04:44,00:04:47,"During the performance, the stages above you are always moving."
33,00:04:50,00:04:54,We found the body here in the crush zone.
34,00:04:56,00:04:58,"Well, we know where she died."
35,00:05:00,00:05:01,Where'd she come from?
36,00:05:22,00:05:24,Where would you like to start?
37,00:05:59,00:06:02,(shutter clicks)
38,00:06:06,00:06:08,Looks like he ate a .38 special.
39,00:06:09,00:06:10,The gun's still in his hand.
40,00:06:10,00:06:11,How many suicides have you seen like that?
41,00:06:12,00:06:13,Personally?
42,00:06:13,00:06:15,"None. Me, either."
43,00:06:15,00:06:17,I haven't found a suicide note.
44,00:06:18,00:06:21,Maybe it was staged.
45,00:06:23,00:06:27,"Sorry, got held up at the ""meet the future in-laws"" dinner."
46,00:06:27,00:06:30,Did they love you?
47,00:06:30,00:06:32,I got a little too excited talking about work.
48,00:06:32,00:06:33,They stopped eating.
49,00:06:33,00:06:35,Oh.
50,00:06:35,00:06:37,"David, the gun is still in his hand; it's yours to clear."
51,00:06:37,00:06:40,"Yes, sir."
52,00:06:40,00:06:42,Rigor's setting in fast.
53,00:06:42,00:06:44,It happens when it's hot like tonight.
54,00:06:44,00:06:45,(gunshot)
55,00:06:45,00:06:46,"Oh, are you all right?"
56,00:06:46,00:06:48,You all right?
57,00:06:48,00:06:50,"It's all right everyone, a misfire."
58,00:06:50,00:06:51,Hey.
59,00:06:51,00:06:53,At least we know one person who shot the dead guy.
60,00:07:03,00:07:05,"Good to see you on your feet again, Jim."
61,00:07:05,00:07:07,"You've never seen me off them, Sam."
62,00:07:07,00:07:09,"You know, this is like old times."
63,00:07:09,00:07:10,"You, me, a party."
64,00:07:10,00:07:12,A dead body.
65,00:07:12,00:07:15,This is supposed to be a celebration.
66,00:07:15,00:07:18,The Eclipse is going to be my legacy.
67,00:07:18,00:07:21,We break ground next year.
68,00:07:21,00:07:23,So I'm guessing you knew the victim-- Robert O'Brien?
69,00:07:23,00:07:25,He invested in The Eclipse.
70,00:07:25,00:07:27,Did you hear the shot?
71,00:07:27,00:07:31,No. Must've taken place during the implosion.
72,00:07:31,00:07:32,You think he shot himself?
73,00:07:32,00:07:34,You think he didn't?
74,00:07:34,00:07:36,"Well, he was about to make a lot of money in your casino; why would he?"
75,00:07:36,00:07:39,"Look, I hardly knew the guy."
76,00:07:39,00:07:41,"Or his partner, Joe Hirschoff."
77,00:07:41,00:07:43,They were marketing the project in L.A.
78,00:07:43,00:07:47,"They had a little money, so I sold them a few shares."
79,00:07:47,00:07:48,How much is a share?
80,00:07:48,00:07:49,Two million.
81,00:07:49,00:07:51,You want it?
82,00:07:51,00:07:53,When was the last time you saw him?
83,00:07:53,00:07:57,Everyone was gathering on the other side of the roof.
84,00:07:57,00:07:59,I think he went off with his partner.
85,00:08:17,00:08:19,I got it.
86,00:08:20,00:08:22,Aircraft carrier.
87,00:08:22,00:08:24,That's what this place reminds me of.
88,00:08:24,00:08:34,"Of course, an aircraft carrier was built for national security and this is a ton of hi-tech, twisted steel for the sake of entertainment."
89,00:08:34,00:08:36,"It's not just entertainment, Nick."
90,00:08:36,00:08:41,The cirque's about the power of imagination-- it's how we were able to put a man on the moon.
91,00:08:50,00:08:52,I've got a monogram necklace.
92,00:08:52,00:08:54,A.F.D.
93,00:08:54,00:08:58,"Well, it's not an I.D., but I'll settle for initials."
94,00:09:02,00:09:05,Did you and Mr. O'Brien arrive together?
95,00:09:05,00:09:07,"Yeah, we're in a suite downstairs."
96,00:09:07,00:09:09,And you've been with him since?
97,00:09:09,00:09:11,Mostly.
98,00:09:11,00:09:15,"A couple minutes before, um, the implosion, I went to get us margaritas."
99,00:09:15,00:09:16,"When I came back, Robert was gone."
100,00:09:16,00:09:19,"I knew he didn't want to miss it, so I went looking."
101,00:09:28,00:09:30,I was by the elevator.
102,00:09:30,00:09:33,I thought maybe Robert had gone back to the suite.
103,00:09:33,00:09:35,Then I heard that girl scream.
104,00:09:37,00:09:39,I just knew.
105,00:09:39,00:09:41,Are you taking any medication?
106,00:09:45,00:09:47,May I see that?
107,00:09:49,00:09:50,Alprazolam.
108,00:09:50,00:09:53,It's for stress. My job is very stressful.
109,00:09:53,00:09:54,Does Mr. O'Brien own a gun?
110,00:09:55,00:09:57,"He hates guns, we both do."
111,00:09:57,00:09:59,Could you hold your hands out for me like this please?
112,00:09:59,00:10:01,Why?
113,00:10:01,00:10:03,Gunshot residue test.
114,00:10:03,00:10:04,Robert shot himself.
115,00:10:04,00:10:06,And this is how we prove it.
116,00:10:06,00:10:08,SIDLE: Right palm down.
117,00:10:12,00:10:14,(sniffs)
118,00:10:14,00:10:16,Am I smelling alcohol on your hand?
119,00:10:16,00:10:19,Yeah.
120,00:10:19,00:10:21,"When I saw Robert, I spilled the drinks."
121,00:10:26,00:10:29,ROBBINS: Standard S.A.E. was collected.
122,00:10:29,00:10:32,No signs of sexual trauma indicated.
123,00:10:36,00:10:41,Several linear red-brown abrasions on the chest and back.
124,00:10:41,00:10:44,Marginal contusions.
125,00:10:47,00:10:52,Palpable underlying rib and sternal fractures.
126,00:10:52,00:10:54,(crackling)
127,00:10:54,00:10:56,"Huh, Rice Krispies."
128,00:10:56,00:10:58,Subcutaneous emphysema.
129,00:10:58,00:11:07,Air in the tissue indicates victim was most likely subjected to significant crushing force across the torso.
130,00:11:07,00:11:09,(groaning)
131,00:11:09,00:11:10,(screaming)
132,00:11:13,00:11:16,"You know, this crush zone is clearly marked."
133,00:11:16,00:11:21,"Yeah, and anybody familiar with the stage would know to avoid that area."
134,00:11:23,00:11:25,Looks like blood on the edge of this lift.
135,00:11:27,00:11:30,It might have been unavoidable.
136,00:11:35,00:11:37,ROBBINS: Her liver was lacerated.
137,00:11:37,00:11:45,"If she'd been alive when the crushing occurred, these lacerations would of resulted in hemoperitoneum and, uh, bilateral hemothorax."
138,00:11:46,00:11:53,But there was no significant hemorrhage in the abdominal or thoracic cavities.
139,00:11:53,00:11:55,So she was dead before she was crushed.
140,00:11:55,00:12:01,"Yeah, C.O.D. was temporal laceration of the brain due to skull fracture."
141,00:12:01,00:12:05,"Initially, I assumed it was associated with a crushing trauma."
142,00:12:05,00:12:06,It wasn't.
143,00:12:06,00:12:08,So the fatal blow was a separate event.
144,00:12:08,00:12:09,Mm-hmm.
145,00:12:09,00:12:13,"Well, the way things move around on that stage, it could have happened anywhere."
146,00:12:13,00:12:16,She looks like she's probably in her mid-20s.
147,00:12:16,00:12:17,She's in good shape.
148,00:12:17,00:12:18,Yeah.
149,00:12:20,00:12:22,Is well toned.
150,00:12:22,00:12:26,She got calluses on her hands and feet.
151,00:12:26,00:12:28,Could be a dancer or a gymnast.
152,00:12:28,00:12:32,"But if she wasn't part of Cirque, what was she doing there?"
153,00:12:34,00:12:35,"BRASS: Hey Sheriff, how's it going?"
154,00:12:35,00:12:37,What can I do for you?
155,00:12:37,00:12:39,This is about what I can do for you.
156,00:12:39,00:12:41,Really? I've asked the Mayor to give you a commendation.
157,00:12:41,00:12:42,Medal of Valor.
158,00:12:42,00:12:43,Congratulations.
159,00:12:43,00:12:47,"Well, that's-that's nice, uh, do I have to be there?"
160,00:12:47,00:12:50,"As a matter of protocol, I'd say you damn well better be, Captain."
161,00:12:50,00:12:58,"Well, you know, Ben, if-- Look, I'm going to say a few nice things, hand you a plaque, we'll shake hands, a whole lot of reporters will be there to take pictures of the big event."
162,00:12:58,00:12:59,It'll be magic. Yeah.
163,00:12:59,00:13:01,My office will call you to set it up.
164,00:13:01,00:13:04,I was going to vote for you anyway.
165,00:13:04,00:13:10,HODGES: The green powder on your vic's dress is open-celled phenolic foam.
166,00:13:10,00:13:12,Holds more than 40 times its weight in water.
167,00:13:12,00:13:16,Reminds me of this girl I knew in college-- I don't need to hear about that.
168,00:13:16,00:13:18,She was a florist.
169,00:13:18,00:13:22,The foam's used almost exclusively in floral arrangements.
170,00:13:24,00:13:25,Wait a minute.
171,00:13:28,00:13:34,The security guard atKAsaid that he let a young woman through the artists' entrance with a delivery of flowers.
172,00:13:34,00:13:37,"He escorted her to the green room, but didn't remember seeing her leave."
173,00:13:37,00:13:39,"Ah, the old flower delivery trick."
174,00:13:40,00:13:41,Works every time.
175,00:13:41,00:13:43,Huh.
176,00:13:45,00:13:49,SANDERS: Cirque du Soleil has cameras all over that theatre.
177,00:13:49,00:13:52,They use them for performance review.
178,00:13:52,00:13:59,"I went through all the feeds the Cirque guys sent over, and I have to tell you, Siegfried &amp; Roy's disappearing elephant no longer impresses me."
179,00:14:00,00:14:01,I'll tell you how they did that later.
180,00:14:03,00:14:04,"STOKES: There's the vic, right?"
181,00:14:04,00:14:05,"Yup, 11-D."
182,00:14:06,00:14:07,Artist's entrance.
183,00:14:07,00:14:11,Girl has the same kind of dress and hair color as the vic.
184,00:14:11,00:14:15,"As far as I can see, they managed to stay hidden backstage for most of the performance."
185,00:14:15,00:14:18,"It's dark, they're wearing black..."
186,00:14:18,00:14:20,crew's focused on their jobs...
187,00:14:20,00:14:22,it's possible nobody saw them.
188,00:14:22,00:14:27,"The guy left alone, same way they came in, just before the show ended."
189,00:14:27,00:14:31,"I tried to make out a face, but there's not much detail here."
190,00:14:31,00:14:32,"However, look at this."
191,00:14:33,00:14:35,Check this out.
192,00:14:38,00:14:40,GRISSOM: She dropped something.
193,00:14:40,00:14:42,I think it's a purse.
194,00:14:42,00:14:44,There was no purse near the body.
195,00:14:44,00:14:45,Or anywhere else backstage.
196,00:14:45,00:14:48,"If we find it, it might get us an ID."
197,00:14:51,00:14:54,STOKES: Give me the time code when she dropped the purse.
198,00:14:55,00:14:57,"Okay, who's in the burrito?"
199,00:14:57,00:14:59,"It's apparent suicide, from Sam Braun's party."
200,00:14:59,00:15:01,Sara and Warrick's case.
201,00:15:01,00:15:02,Gunshot to the head.
202,00:15:16,00:15:18,What's this?
203,00:15:19,00:15:21,He bled out in the bag.
204,00:15:21,00:15:25,I guess I forgot to tape them shut.
205,00:15:28,00:15:31,This blood corrupts any GSR.
206,00:15:33,00:15:35,Clean it up.
207,00:17:06,00:17:07,"SARA: Hey, Doc, you tell me."
208,00:17:07,00:17:10,Suicide or homicide?
209,00:17:10,00:17:12,Either side at this point.
210,00:17:12,00:17:14,"According to Tox, B.A.C. was point-one-nine."
211,00:17:14,00:17:20,"That's over twice the legal limit. My guess, based on the whiffing the stomach contents, tequila."
212,00:17:20,00:17:22,"You're good, he was drinking margaritas."
213,00:17:22,00:17:25,Tox also found alprazolam in his bloodstream.
214,00:17:25,00:17:27,"Yeah, his partner has a prescription for it."
215,00:17:27,00:17:30,He was also the one bringing him drinks. Hmm.
216,00:17:30,00:17:32,Hand me that trajectory rod. Sure.
217,00:17:32,00:17:33,Thank you.
218,00:17:41,00:17:42,"Sara, hold this in would you? Sure."
219,00:17:42,00:17:43,Here we go.
220,00:17:44,00:17:49,"However he got it, he probably would've been too stoned to stand."
221,00:17:49,00:17:54,It would of made it easier to stick a gun in his mouth at this angle.
222,00:17:56,00:17:58,(people cheering)
223,00:18:00,00:18:02,Look in there.
224,00:18:05,00:18:06,Sesame seeds?
225,00:18:06,00:18:07,I think so.
226,00:18:07,00:18:10,"I found them in the oral cavity, but not in the stomach contents."
227,00:18:10,00:18:14,It's hard to swallow when you have a gun in your mouth.
228,00:18:19,00:18:25,"STOKES: Okay, let me know when the Cliff Deck is where it was at that point in the show."
229,00:18:25,00:18:31,"Um, I think it was just before the ""Wash Up to the Shore"" scene."
230,00:18:31,00:18:34,"That was at, uh, 21 minutes, 37 seconds."
231,00:18:34,00:18:36,MAN (over radio): Copy that.
232,00:18:36,00:18:38,"Yeah, that's great."
233,00:18:38,00:18:40,"That's great right there, thanks."
234,00:18:43,00:18:45,Okay...
235,00:18:45,00:18:48,go find your friend.
236,00:18:52,00:18:56,"Okay, move the Deck into its next position, please."
237,00:18:56,00:18:58,"Copy that, foot deck is on the move."
238,00:19:15,00:19:18,Initiating dump sequence.
239,00:19:45,00:19:47,Amazing.
240,00:19:47,00:19:49,Ground cork.
241,00:19:49,00:19:50,"From the audience, it looks like real sand."
242,00:19:50,00:19:55,"You know, if you want to dive in here and give me a hand this might go a little faster."
243,00:19:55,00:19:57,(giggles)
244,00:19:57,00:19:59,Nice try.
245,00:20:02,00:20:04,"Okay, hang on."
246,00:20:04,00:20:07,I think I found something.
247,00:20:07,00:20:09,This isn't the purse I dropped.
248,00:20:16,00:20:19,"Celia Noel, Wisconsin."
249,00:20:19,00:20:24,"Well, the initials on the necklace that Catherine found were ""A-F-D""."
250,00:20:24,00:20:27,"Well, clearly not her initials, but check this out."
251,00:20:29,00:20:32,It looks like she hit every Cirque show in town.
252,00:20:32,00:20:34,Apparently one a little bit harder than the others.
253,00:20:36,00:20:47,"BURDICK: On May 11, 2006, with an innocent life hanging in the balance, Captain Brass went into that hotel room alone, face-to-face with a deranged killer."
254,00:20:47,00:20:49,Brass looks like he's about to puke.
255,00:20:49,00:20:51,"Captain Brass was severely wounded, Or punch someone."
256,00:20:51,00:20:53,but the hostage's life was saved.
257,00:20:53,00:21:00,"And for these actions which exemplify the dedication of the Las Vegas Police Department, the City thanks you."
258,00:21:04,00:21:07,REPORTER: This is Captain Brass' second commendation in the line of duty.
259,00:21:07,00:21:09,The first was in...
260,00:21:09,00:21:12,I got you a veggie burger.
261,00:21:12,00:21:13,Thanks.
262,00:21:13,00:21:15,What about me?
263,00:21:15,00:21:17,I didn't know you were here. Soysorry.
264,00:21:18,00:21:20,Where's the love?
265,00:21:20,00:21:23,So we found some gunk in the revolver's forcing cone.
266,00:21:23,00:21:25,Hodges ID'd it as...
267,00:21:25,00:21:26,melted sesame seeds.
268,00:21:26,00:21:28,Doc Robbins found sesame seeds in the vic's mouth.
269,00:21:28,00:21:31,Any prints on the gun? No.
270,00:21:32,00:21:33,"The grip was checked, we don't usually get prints off those."
271,00:21:34,00:21:35,Is it registered?
272,00:21:35,00:21:37,"In California, to a Joe Hirschoff."
273,00:21:37,00:21:38,Really? Yeah.
274,00:21:38,00:21:40,He said he hated guns.
275,00:21:40,00:21:41,Check this out...
276,00:21:41,00:21:44,I researched ownership in The Eclipse project.
277,00:21:44,00:21:49,The vic and Joe Hirschoff held their share as joint tenants. Really?
278,00:21:49,00:21:51,Which means...
279,00:21:51,00:21:55,"With Robert dead, Joe automatically and immediately owns all the shares."
280,00:21:55,00:21:58,Sounds like a great reason to kill.
281,00:21:58,00:21:59,Why did you lie?
282,00:21:59,00:22:01,I didn't lie.
283,00:22:01,00:22:04,I bought the gun when I moved to L.A.
284,00:22:05,00:22:08,White kid from a small town...
285,00:22:08,00:22:09,Put it in a closet.
286,00:22:09,00:22:10,Forgot it was there.
287,00:22:10,00:22:13,How did Robert get it? I don't...
288,00:22:13,00:22:15,"Going through my stuff, I guess."
289,00:22:15,00:22:17,Did he take your pills?
290,00:22:17,00:22:19,'Cause we found them in his bloodstream.
291,00:22:20,00:22:21,I don't know.
292,00:22:21,00:22:24,"You don't know? No, I don't know."
293,00:22:24,00:22:25,Robert was depressed. Maybe he did.
294,00:22:25,00:22:27,"You know, we did a credit check on you, Joe."
295,00:22:27,00:22:29,You're in hock for over a million dollars.
296,00:22:29,00:22:31,It's personal debt-- that's heavy paper.
297,00:22:32,00:22:34,I'm leveraged.
298,00:22:34,00:22:35,"(chuckles) Yeah, I'm leveraged."
299,00:22:35,00:22:37,So what?
300,00:22:38,00:22:39,(chuckling): I live well...
301,00:22:41,00:22:43,I live well by believing in myself.
302,00:22:43,00:22:47,"No, you live well by playing the come line with borrowed money."
303,00:22:47,00:22:54,"You know, Joe, you're the type of guy-- you see something you like, you got to have it, including your partner's share in The Eclipse."
304,00:22:54,00:23:01,"So you put your pills in his drink, he nods off, you wrap his fingers around your gun, and then you get to live really well."
305,00:23:04,00:23:06,I want my lawyer.
306,00:23:07,00:23:09,SIDLE: Is this everything?
307,00:23:09,00:23:13,BROWN: Everything from Hirschoff's and O'Brien's room that I could get under the warrant.
308,00:23:13,00:23:14,No suicide note?
309,00:23:15,00:23:18,Not even in the Holy Bible.
310,00:23:18,00:23:20,"That is the first place I look, too."
311,00:23:26,00:23:28,Did the suite have a kitchen?
312,00:23:29,00:23:31,No.
313,00:23:31,00:23:33,Why pack an oven mitt?
314,00:23:41,00:23:43,Sesame seeds.
315,00:23:48,00:23:50,The blood on the necklace was the victim's.
316,00:23:50,00:23:51,A.F.D.
317,00:23:51,00:23:53,Arcadia Federation of Dance.
318,00:23:53,00:23:59,"Celia Noel was a dancer, which would explain her fascination with Cirque."
319,00:23:59,00:24:00,You still like to dance?
320,00:24:02,00:24:05,"I don't mean the way you used to, I..."
321,00:24:05,00:24:08,"I know what you mean, and yes, I do."
322,00:24:10,00:24:13,I think I have a line on the victim's date.
323,00:24:13,00:24:23,"Now, four of the tickets that we pulled from her purse were charged to her credit card, but theZumanity ticket was purchased with a different card, one belonging to a gentleman named Arnie..."
324,00:24:23,00:24:25,Clifton.
325,00:24:26,00:24:27,He should have paid cash.
326,00:24:35,00:24:38,"Yeah, Celia and I scoped outZumanity."
327,00:24:38,00:24:39,Sexy stuff.
328,00:24:39,00:24:41,CURTIS: Right up your alley.
329,00:24:41,00:24:45,"I've got all kinds of alleys, but, uh, yeah, I'd say that's one of them."
330,00:24:45,00:24:47,How'd you two meet?
331,00:24:47,00:24:49,I touched her feet for over an hour.
332,00:24:49,00:24:51,She tried on 20 pairs of shoes.
333,00:24:51,00:24:53,Did she invite you to the show?
334,00:24:53,00:24:55,Yeah.
335,00:24:55,00:24:56,Did you pay for it?
336,00:24:56,00:24:58,I'm a gentleman.
337,00:24:58,00:25:00,Best toe cleavage I ever saw.
338,00:25:00,00:25:03,CURTIS: What did you do after the show? Nothing.
339,00:25:03,00:25:05,We had a nice time; she split.
340,00:25:05,00:25:07,Haven't seen her since.
341,00:25:07,00:25:09,We have.
342,00:25:09,00:25:10,She's dead.
343,00:25:10,00:25:13,Backstage atKA.
344,00:25:13,00:25:16,You didn't join her for the double feature? (scoffs)
345,00:25:16,00:25:18,"Nah, man, not me."
346,00:25:18,00:25:22,"Look, uh, are we done, 'cause I got to get back to work."
347,00:25:22,00:25:24,"STOKES: No, we're not done here."
348,00:25:25,00:25:27,You got sand in your shoes.
349,00:25:30,00:25:34,Finely ground particles of Portuguese cork.
350,00:25:34,00:25:40,"Same stuff they use backstage atKA, which places you at the crime scene."
351,00:25:42,00:25:44,"Okay, so what if I was there?"
352,00:25:44,00:25:49,"You were there with a woman who wound up dead, which is why you're here."
353,00:25:50,00:25:52,Zumanitygot me all worked up.
354,00:25:52,00:25:53,She was grabbing on me.
355,00:25:53,00:25:54,I-I was down to do whatever she wanted.
356,00:25:54,00:25:56,What did she want to do?
357,00:25:56,00:25:58,"Go backstage atKA,see it up close and personal."
358,00:25:58,00:26:00,She was bananas about that show.
359,00:26:00,00:26:04,She said to meet her near the artists' entrance just after the show started.
360,00:26:04,00:26:06,I did. She let me in.
361,00:26:06,00:26:08,"And you thought if you went with her, you'd get laid?"
362,00:26:08,00:26:14,I figured maybe backstage atKA was her version of the mile high club.
363,00:26:14,00:26:17,"Come on, come on."
364,00:26:17,00:26:19,"Celia, just relax for a minute."
365,00:26:19,00:26:20,Come on.
366,00:26:26,00:26:30,Something clipped her in the side of the head.
367,00:26:30,00:26:33,She fell. She didn't even scream.
368,00:26:33,00:26:35,"I was just so freaked out, I bailed, I'm telling you."
369,00:26:35,00:26:38,"I tried to warn her, but she was just too fired up."
370,00:26:38,00:26:41,She kept trying to get closer and closer and closer.
371,00:26:41,00:26:43,"Yeah, and you let her."
372,00:26:43,00:26:46,You need to write a statement.
373,00:26:46,00:26:51,I perfected my butterfly technique on chicken breasts.
374,00:26:51,00:26:58,I sauté them in a chardonnay reduction with herbes de Provence.
375,00:26:58,00:27:00,Drives women wild.
376,00:27:00,00:27:03,"Well, Mom."
377,00:27:03,00:27:05,Now say the magic words.
378,00:27:05,00:27:08,"""Shut up, Hodges""?"
379,00:27:08,00:27:34,"No. ""Open sesame."" Hand me that can of Ferro-Trace."
380,00:27:34,00:27:37,I live to serve.
381,00:27:46,00:27:50,The gun was transported to the hotel room in the oven mitt.
382,00:27:50,00:27:54,"Only question is, who brought it to the party?"
383,00:28:59,00:29:01,SIDLE: The trail of seeds proved it.
384,00:29:02,00:29:05,"It was suicide, after all."
385,00:29:05,00:29:06,(gunshot)
386,00:29:09,00:29:13,It's the first time I've ever seen a suicide where the gun stays in the vic's hand.
387,00:29:13,00:29:15,"I have an explanation for that, too."
388,00:29:15,00:29:17,Dupuytren's contracture.
389,00:29:17,00:29:23,"It's a rare condition, characterized by progressive fibrosis of the palmar fascia, The tissues thicken..."
390,00:29:24,00:29:27,...contracting the fingers.
391,00:29:27,00:29:29,He couldn't let go of the gun.
392,00:29:30,00:29:35,"The condition was still in its early stages, which is why it looked like rigor."
393,00:29:35,00:29:36,Do we have any idea why he killed himself?
394,00:29:37,00:29:38,"Depression, maybe."
395,00:29:38,00:29:42,"You know, according to my supervisor, we're not really in the business of why, but..."
396,00:29:43,00:29:45,(phone rings)
397,00:29:45,00:29:46,I got to go.
398,00:29:46,00:29:48,Bye.
399,00:29:50,00:29:52,SIDLE: These are Robert's personal effects.
400,00:30:13,00:30:15,I'm very sorry for your loss.
401,00:30:25,00:30:28,Okay. I'll do it.
402,00:30:28,00:30:29,"Hey, Jim."
403,00:30:29,00:30:31,What's up?
404,00:30:33,00:30:35,Where's your hardware?
405,00:30:35,00:30:37,"Oh, come on, come on."
406,00:30:37,00:30:39,Don't even try it; you were all over the news.
407,00:30:39,00:30:40,Let's see it. (groans)
408,00:30:43,00:30:45,Wow.
409,00:30:45,00:30:47,That's beautiful.
410,00:30:47,00:30:49,What's with all the modesty?
411,00:30:49,00:30:50,"It should be up on your wall, man."
412,00:30:50,00:30:51,For what?
413,00:30:51,00:30:54,For taking a bullet or not dying?
414,00:30:54,00:30:56,For being brave.
415,00:30:56,00:30:57,"You know, Warrick, I'll tell you something."
416,00:30:57,00:31:02,"I walked into that hotel room, and 23 years of police work told me I knew what that guy was about."
417,00:31:02,00:31:04,And he played me like a damn rookie.
418,00:31:04,00:31:06,He beat me at my own game.
419,00:31:06,00:31:10,"I mean, what's the dumbest thing you've ever done?"
420,00:31:10,00:31:14,"You want to make a poster of it, put it on your wall?"
421,00:31:14,00:31:16,I don't think so.
422,00:31:16,00:31:18,(plaque clattering)
423,00:31:20,00:31:22,But thanks for coming by.
424,00:31:23,00:31:24,All right.
425,00:31:31,00:31:33,So do you think Grissom will show?
426,00:31:33,00:31:35,Not if he thinks he has to dance. (chuckles)
427,00:31:35,00:31:41,"MAN (over speaker): Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow night, more than 18,000 people are going to come and see this guy at the Thomas and Mack Center."
428,00:31:41,00:31:44,"But tonight, you guys are going to hear him first."
429,00:31:44,00:31:47,Everybody give it up for Mr. John Mayer!
430,00:31:47,00:31:48,(applause and cheering)
431,00:31:48,00:31:50,Ooh. I like him.
432,00:31:50,00:31:52,I think you got to dance.
433,00:31:52,00:31:54,"Come on, let's go. My God."
434,00:31:54,00:31:58,(soulful pop melody playing)
435,00:33:50,00:33:54,(applause and cheering) (chuckling): Oh...
436,00:33:54,00:33:56,Awesome.
437,00:33:56,00:33:59,(whooping)
438,00:33:59,00:34:01,I think I know her. I know that guy.
439,00:34:02,00:34:03,"Yeah, I bet you do."
440,00:34:03,00:34:04,Ask her to dance.
441,00:34:04,00:34:06,Yeah? I'm going to get a drink.
442,00:34:06,00:34:07,You're sure? Go for it.
443,00:34:09,00:34:10,"Hey, Nicky."
444,00:34:11,00:34:14,"(intro to ""Slow Dancing In A Burning Room"" plays)"
445,00:34:19,00:34:22,The guy down there wants to buy you your next drink.
446,00:34:26,00:34:27,"No, thanks."
447,00:37:14,00:37:17,Have you ever seen anything like this?
448,00:37:19,00:37:21,No.
449,00:37:21,00:37:24,The detail is...
450,00:37:24,00:37:25,Terrifying.
451,00:37:25,00:37:27,GRISSOM: Impressive.
452,00:37:27,00:37:29,And yes...
453,00:37:29,00:37:31,terrifying.
454,00:37:35,00:37:38,Which do you think came first: the chicken or the egg?
455,00:37:41,00:37:42,I've always been an egg man.
456,00:37:44,00:37:47,"But this time, I don't know."
457,00:37:50,00:37:52,(Willows groans)
458,00:38:20,00:38:22,(groans)
459,00:38:42,00:38:44,(shutter clicks)
460,00:39:10,00:39:12,(dialing)
461,00:39:15,00:39:17,WOMAN (on phone): Las Vegas Crime Lab?
462,00:39:17,00:39:18,How can I help you?
