0,00:00:04,00:00:06,"COACH: Pass it, there you go."
1,00:00:06,00:00:07,Get it in.
2,00:00:07,00:00:08,"Now get back, hustle back."
3,00:00:08,00:00:10,"Russell, hustle."
4,00:00:10,00:00:13,"Pass the ball, get rid of it."
5,00:00:13,00:00:15,There you go.
6,00:00:15,00:00:16,"""D"" up."
7,00:00:18,00:00:19,Nicely done.
8,00:00:19,00:00:20,There you go.
9,00:00:22,00:00:24,"Use your feet, Russell. Use your feet."
10,00:00:24,00:00:26,Stay low... Stay low!
11,00:00:26,00:00:28,Don't reach! (blows whistle)
12,00:00:28,00:00:30,What the hell are you doing?
13,00:00:30,00:00:31,"I'm playing ""D,"" Coach."
14,00:00:31,00:00:33,Try doing it like you're not in high school.
15,00:00:33,00:00:35,Coach... You shut up.
16,00:00:37,00:00:38,You sit your ass down.
17,00:00:38,00:00:40,"What, are you serious?"
18,00:00:40,00:00:43,"You gonna cry like a little bitch, huh?"
19,00:00:43,00:00:44,Get the hell off my damn court.
20,00:00:44,00:00:46,"Hey, Charlie, Charlie."
21,00:00:46,00:00:49,"You want to ride the bench for the rest of the season, Russell?"
22,00:00:55,00:00:57,Tell Austin this is a closed practice.
23,00:00:57,00:01:01,He's the president of the university and he's sitting next to the guy whose name is on this gym.
24,00:01:01,00:01:05,It's not his gym... it's mine.
25,00:01:05,00:01:07,Kick 'em both out.
26,00:01:07,00:01:08,Now.
27,00:01:15,00:01:17,"(door squeaks, closes)"
28,00:01:31,00:01:33,"Oh, look at that."
29,00:01:33,00:01:36,I'm so glad you're home.
30,00:01:36,00:01:38,Me too.
31,00:01:39,00:01:41,No more bacon.
32,00:01:41,00:01:42,What do you mean?
33,00:01:42,00:01:46,"Oh, please, you think I don't know what you do when I'm not here?"
34,00:01:46,00:01:49,I always said you were a better detective than me.
35,00:01:49,00:01:52,"Oh, I think Charlie has a girlfriend."
36,00:01:52,00:01:53,What's your evidence?
37,00:01:53,00:01:55,Laundry.
38,00:01:55,00:01:59,"He's bought new clothes, and they're not the kind you play basketball in."
39,00:01:59,00:02:00,They're the kind you...
40,00:02:00,00:02:01,Wear to impress someone.
41,00:02:01,00:02:02,And I saw him washing his car.
42,00:02:02,00:02:04,"Oh, dear Lord, must be serious."
43,00:02:04,00:02:07,(phone rings)
44,00:02:07,00:02:09,I'm sorry.
45,00:02:09,00:02:11,"Yeah, Jim, what's up?"
46,00:02:11,00:02:14,(shower running) BRASS: And I'm gonna want to talk to the maintenance guy...
47,00:02:14,00:02:16,"Yeah, I'll walk over there with you."
48,00:02:18,00:02:22,So the janitor found him around 8:00 a.m.
49,00:02:22,00:02:23,"RUSSELL: David, can I see him, please?"
50,00:02:23,00:02:25,"Oh, yeah."
51,00:02:28,00:02:31,RUSSELL: Tom Burns was a hell of a coach.
52,00:02:31,00:02:35,He started recruiting Charlie in junior high.
53,00:02:35,00:02:37,Charlie thought the world of him.
54,00:02:37,00:02:39,He's not the only one.
55,00:02:39,00:02:43,"Well, my guys said they didn't touch anything, so it's all yours."
56,00:02:54,00:02:56,Liver temp?
57,00:02:56,00:02:58,"Uh, 97 on the nose."
58,00:02:58,00:03:02,"Warm water, naked body on cold tile."
59,00:03:02,00:03:05,"If my math's right, couldn't be dead much more than about three hours."
60,00:03:05,00:03:09,"So that puts time of death around 5:00, 5:15 a.m."
61,00:03:09,00:03:11,Guy was an early riser.
62,00:03:11,00:03:13,"Yeah, old habits die hard."
63,00:03:13,00:03:15,He used to play ball for West Point.
64,00:03:15,00:03:20,"He still gets up at 4:00 in the morning, jogs to the campus, works out, then jumps in the pool for 30 laps."
65,00:03:20,00:03:21,Be enough to kill me.
66,00:03:21,00:03:25,"Well, somebody gave the coach a little help."
67,00:04:03,00:04:05,SIDLE: So I talked to the janitor.
68,00:04:05,00:04:07,Place was cleaned up and locked down by 1:00 a.m.
69,00:04:07,00:04:09,Coach Burns had a key.
70,00:04:09,00:04:10,Yeah.
71,00:04:10,00:04:16,"Okay, so Coach Burns finishes his workout and then he comes to take a shower."
72,00:04:16,00:04:19,Someone comes in and hits him from behind.
73,00:04:19,00:04:21,(grunts)
74,00:04:21,00:04:25,"First swing's always for free, no blood."
75,00:04:25,00:04:26,He goes down.
76,00:04:26,00:04:28,Killer goes to town.
77,00:04:30,00:04:36,Elongated blood drops suggest that it was at a low angle and multiple blows.
78,00:04:36,00:04:39,There's no sign of the murder weapon anywhere.
79,00:04:39,00:04:40,Took it with him.
80,00:04:40,00:04:41,Looks like...
81,00:04:41,00:04:46,someone tried to clean up to cover their tracks.
82,00:04:46,00:04:48,Here you go.
83,00:04:49,00:04:50,Could you hit the lights?
84,00:04:56,00:04:58,Swipe marks.
85,00:04:58,00:05:02,Arcing suggests the killer backed out of the shower into the locker room.
86,00:05:02,00:05:04,Covering his tracks.
87,00:05:04,00:05:09,"Then the cleanup stops, yeah, right about here."
88,00:05:09,00:05:11,"To the naked eye. Hmm, not to ours."
89,00:05:11,00:05:13,SIDLE: Shoe impressions.
90,00:05:13,00:05:15,Just the front half.
91,00:05:18,00:05:20,Heading towards the locker room exit.
92,00:05:22,00:05:26,Spacing-- only the balls of the feet.
93,00:05:26,00:05:31,"Suggests running. The other impressions-- also evenly spaced, heading towards the door."
94,00:05:31,00:05:33,It's an odd pattern.
95,00:05:33,00:05:36,"Sport shoe, maybe cleats?"
96,00:05:36,00:05:38,We might be looking for more than one killer.
97,00:05:47,00:05:49,"Oh, wrong room, I'm so sorry."
98,00:05:49,00:05:51,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
99,00:05:52,00:05:56,"Oh, hey, um, I would have called, but..."
100,00:05:56,00:05:57,Sorry.
101,00:05:57,00:05:59,"No, I'm sorry."
102,00:05:59,00:06:01,"You are Charlie's dad, and I..."
103,00:06:01,00:06:04,This is so not how I wanted us to meet.
104,00:06:04,00:06:07,"Dad, this is Vanessa, my girlfriend."
105,00:06:07,00:06:09,Think I got that part.
106,00:06:09,00:06:11,"So, what's going on?"
107,00:06:11,00:06:15,Charlie... (sighs heavily) Coach Burns is dead.
108,00:06:15,00:06:17,He's dead?
109,00:06:17,00:06:18,"Oh, my God."
110,00:06:18,00:06:20,What happened?
111,00:06:20,00:06:24,"Actually, I'd like to talk to you in private about that, if you don't mind. VANESSA: Not at all."
112,00:06:24,00:06:26,I'm so sorry.
113,00:06:26,00:06:28,"I'll call you later, okay?"
114,00:06:28,00:06:29,CHARLIE: Yeah.
115,00:06:29,00:06:31,(door closes)
116,00:06:31,00:06:33,"Charlie, Coach was murdered."
117,00:06:33,00:06:34,What?
118,00:06:34,00:06:36,Yeah.
119,00:06:40,00:06:42,I'm so sorry.
120,00:06:42,00:06:44,What happened?
121,00:06:44,00:06:48,Do you know if any of the players had a beef with him?
122,00:06:48,00:06:51,All of us... at one point or another.
123,00:06:51,00:06:55,"I mean, right or wrong, we all think we're superstars going to the NBA."
124,00:06:55,00:06:59,"Egos get out of hand, Coach slaps 'em down."
125,00:06:59,00:07:01,Did he slap down anyone in particular?
126,00:07:01,00:07:03,"Yeah, but it wasn't a player."
127,00:07:03,00:07:11,"Last night, after practice, I, I was in the shower, and I know it sounds weird, but I felt like, like someone was there."
128,00:07:11,00:07:15,"I didn't see them, but it was like they were watching me, like, waiting for me to leave."
129,00:07:15,00:07:18,"Okay, w-what's this have to do with Coach?"
130,00:07:18,00:07:26,"Well, after I left the gym, I, I had to come back 'cause I left my dorm key, and that's when I heard them arguing-- Coach and Jack Oxford."
131,00:07:26,00:07:28,"Oxford--the, the deep pockets guy?"
132,00:07:28,00:07:30,"Yeah, Mr. Hedge Fund."
133,00:07:30,00:07:33,"I put $8 million into this school, into this program."
134,00:07:33,00:07:35,I deserve some respect.
135,00:07:35,00:07:37,"Respect is earned, not bought."
136,00:07:37,00:07:43,"CHARLIE: I didn't hear much, but, you know, money, the team-- the same crap they always argue about."
137,00:07:44,00:07:47,"Okay, um, I got to get back."
138,00:07:47,00:07:49,"Come here, buddy; come here."
139,00:07:51,00:07:57,"Oh, wait a minute now, the girlfriend--been going together long?"
140,00:07:57,00:07:58,A couple months. Oh.
141,00:07:58,00:08:00,Thanks for sharing.
142,00:08:00,00:08:01,Is she nice?
143,00:08:01,00:08:03,Yeah.
144,00:08:03,00:08:04,Good.
145,00:08:04,00:08:05,I'll call you.
146,00:08:05,00:08:07,Yeah.
147,00:08:09,00:08:12,"STOKES: Those are some pretty nasty head wounds there, Doc."
148,00:08:12,00:08:15,Victim was struck at least nine times to the head and the face.
149,00:08:15,00:08:19,"Fractured skull, nose, cheekbone."
150,00:08:20,00:08:22,And no defensive wounds.
151,00:08:22,00:08:23,Guy never had a chance.
152,00:08:23,00:08:30,"Well, I found two different wound patterns-- one large and flat, the other small and triangular."
153,00:08:30,00:08:34,"The large wounds have clean margins, show signs of caving."
154,00:08:34,00:08:36,The smaller ones are deeper and sharper.
155,00:08:36,00:08:40,So two different weapons or one weapon used two different ways?
156,00:08:40,00:08:44,"I can't tell you, but what I can tell you is, our victim was no stranger to violence lately."
157,00:08:44,00:08:46,What do you mean?
158,00:08:46,00:08:50,"Well, his left nares had clotted blood from a recent antemortem injury."
159,00:08:50,00:08:54,So someone punched him in the nose before his head got caved in?
160,00:08:54,00:08:56,"By several hours, I'd say."
161,00:08:56,00:09:00,I found injuries that even predate that.
162,00:09:00,00:09:01,STOKES: Bruising.
163,00:09:01,00:09:03,How long ago do you think this was?
164,00:09:03,00:09:04,Two or three days.
165,00:09:04,00:09:11,David found this when he was washing the body-- a dried substance on the forehead.
166,00:09:11,00:09:13,"He took a swab, sent it off to DNA."
167,00:09:13,00:09:16,"Circular, gravitational."
168,00:09:16,00:09:18,I can tell you what it looks like from here.
169,00:09:18,00:09:20,I didn't find any evidence of sexual assault.
170,00:09:20,00:09:24,"You know, sometimes a beating is just a beating."
171,00:09:24,00:09:27,"OXFORD: Yeah, Burns and I got into it. So what?"
172,00:09:27,00:09:29,We had some things to discuss.
173,00:09:29,00:09:31,Like what?
174,00:09:31,00:09:32,None of your business.
175,00:09:32,00:09:39,"You know, a witness at last night's practice told us the coach had you and the university president kicked out of the gym."
176,00:09:39,00:09:40,Your gym.
177,00:09:40,00:09:41,Damn right it's my gym.
178,00:09:41,00:09:43,That'd make me mad.
179,00:09:43,00:09:46,"Well, that's the difference between you and me."
180,00:09:46,00:09:50,I manage a hedge fund worth $9 billion.
181,00:09:50,00:09:54,This watch--probably worth more than you make in a year.
182,00:09:54,00:09:58,"I don't get mad, Detective; I get what I want."
183,00:09:58,00:10:02,And did you want Coach Burns dead in the shower-- this morning--of your gym?
184,00:10:02,00:10:04,What's the upside in that?
185,00:10:04,00:10:06,All the millions of dollars I put into this program...
186,00:10:06,00:10:10,Killing the head coach-- not exactly a shrewd business strategy.
187,00:10:10,00:10:11,What's your point?
188,00:10:11,00:10:18,"When a naked basketball coach gets beaten to death in the showers, it's not a good thing."
189,00:10:18,00:10:20,Your compassion is overwhelming.
190,00:10:20,00:10:28,"And so is your incompetence, because every minute you spend in here with me is a minute you could be out there looking for the guy that did this."
191,00:10:28,00:10:31,"Why, look at that, I have to go."
192,00:10:34,00:10:35,Don't go far.
193,00:10:39,00:10:41,"Well, you were right, Madame Poirot, about our son."
194,00:10:41,00:10:44,I just met his girlfriend.
195,00:10:44,00:10:45,Charlie said you walked in on them.
196,00:10:45,00:10:47,"(laughing): Did he? Yeah, yeah, I did."
197,00:10:47,00:10:49,"Remember, we were supposed to have dinner tonight."
198,00:10:49,00:10:50,Really?
199,00:10:50,00:10:53,"I thought, with everything that's going on, maybe he'd reschedule."
200,00:10:53,00:10:55,I guess he has other things on his mind.
201,00:10:55,00:10:58,He asked me to set another place at the table.
202,00:10:58,00:11:00,She's a vegetarian.
203,00:11:00,00:11:03,"Well, I guess she'll fit right in, then, huh?"
204,00:11:18,00:11:19,(mechanical rumbling)
205,00:11:19,00:11:21,(burbling)
206,00:11:21,00:11:23,"(crackling, hissing)"
207,00:11:29,00:11:30,(whirring)
208,00:11:33,00:11:34,(whirring)
209,00:11:41,00:11:43,"Hey, Henry."
210,00:11:43,00:11:46,"Hey, uh, bloody towels were a match to Coach Burns."
211,00:11:46,00:11:48,Definitely what was used to clean up the crime scene.
212,00:11:48,00:11:49,No more locker room laundry.
213,00:11:49,00:11:52,I just went through three carts of dirty towels.
214,00:11:52,00:11:54,This whole place smells like feet.
215,00:11:54,00:11:58,Now it is going to smell like something else.
216,00:11:58,00:12:02,(sighs) Give me the ruler. And you might want to borrow some of Russell's incense.
217,00:12:02,00:12:03,Pretty ripe.
218,00:12:03,00:12:06,(sighs) Wait.
219,00:12:06,00:12:08,That's blood spatter.
220,00:12:08,00:12:09,Medium velocity.
221,00:12:09,00:12:12,"Well, that's not from any kind of cleanup."
222,00:12:12,00:12:15,Spatter like that only gets on someone one way.
223,00:12:15,00:12:17,I think we have a suspect.
224,00:12:22,00:12:24,"BRASS: You really ought to do your own laundry, kid."
225,00:12:24,00:12:29,"RUSSELL: We tested the blood on your jersey, T.J., and it matches the coach."
226,00:12:29,00:12:34,It's also the same as the blood that was on the towels that were used to try to wipe up the killer's footprints.
227,00:12:34,00:12:36,"We know that Coach Burns kept a tight schedule, predictable."
228,00:12:36,00:12:37,Whoever killed him knew that.
229,00:12:37,00:12:39,And knew their way around the gym.
230,00:12:39,00:12:41,"Burns was a hard-ass, we all know that."
231,00:12:41,00:12:45,Maybe he got what was coming to him. No.
232,00:12:45,00:12:49,"I mean, yeah, Coach is tough."
233,00:12:49,00:12:50,"And sometimes that was hard, but..."
234,00:12:50,00:12:52,I respected him.
235,00:12:52,00:12:55,I'd never...
236,00:12:55,00:12:56,I understand.
237,00:12:56,00:13:00,Charlie's on the team; I've heard all the stories.
238,00:13:00,00:13:02,But maybe there's something that we don't know about.
239,00:13:02,00:13:07,"Like what? BRASS: Well, whoever killed him had a lot of rage."
240,00:13:07,00:13:10,Beating a man naked in the shower...
241,00:13:10,00:13:12,"Whoa, whoa, whoa... whoa, wait a minute."
242,00:13:12,00:13:15,"If you're suggesting what I think you are, n-no way."
243,00:13:15,00:13:17,Coach wasn't like that.
244,00:13:17,00:13:19,And I wasn't anywhere near the gym this morning.
245,00:13:19,00:13:21,How do you explain the blood on your jersey?
246,00:13:23,00:13:26,"Come on, T.J., you got to tell us something here."
247,00:13:26,00:13:29,"Otherwise, we won't be able to help you."
248,00:13:29,00:13:31,(sighs)
249,00:13:31,00:13:36,"Last night, after practice, there was a fight in the locker room."
250,00:13:36,00:13:37,Somebody threw a punch at Coach.
251,00:13:37,00:13:40,I stepped in to try to stop it.
252,00:13:40,00:13:43,That's how the blood got on my jersey.
253,00:13:43,00:13:45,"Okay. All right, thank you."
254,00:13:45,00:13:46,Who threw the punch?
255,00:13:51,00:13:52,Your son.
256,00:14:00,00:14:02,"I need more focus, Russell."
257,00:14:02,00:14:05,"Commitment. The goal is to chase titles, not girls."
258,00:14:05,00:14:10,"Excuse me? Look, ever since you've started dating that tramp-- what's her name? Vanessa..."
259,00:14:10,00:14:11,Don't talk about her like that.
260,00:14:11,00:14:13,"That's what she is, right? A tramp."
261,00:14:16,00:14:18,BURNS: You're done!
262,00:14:18,00:14:19,You're done.
263,00:14:23,00:14:24,What T.J. told you was true.
264,00:14:24,00:14:27,I... I did take a swing at the coach.
265,00:14:27,00:14:28,"Where were you this morning, Charlie?"
266,00:14:28,00:14:31,"Um... got up early, 5:00 a.m."
267,00:14:31,00:14:33,"Went to the stadium, ran steps."
268,00:14:33,00:14:35,Can anyone verify your whereabouts?
269,00:14:35,00:14:36,Is that really necessary?
270,00:14:36,00:14:38,"Yes, it is."
271,00:14:38,00:14:44,"Um... nobody saw me at the stadium, but Vanessa was here when I woke up."
272,00:14:44,00:14:45,She saw me leave.
273,00:14:45,00:14:48,I was working out for an hour and a half.
274,00:14:48,00:14:50,Then I met up with her for breakfast.
275,00:14:50,00:14:51,Who's Vanessa?
276,00:14:51,00:14:54,It's his girlfriend. D.B.
277,00:14:54,00:14:56,"Who's Vanessa, Charlie?"
278,00:14:56,00:14:58,Vanessa Drake. She's a student.
279,00:14:58,00:15:00,A grad student. Psychology.
280,00:15:00,00:15:02,I can give you her number. (phone beeping)
281,00:15:02,00:15:04,"Yeah, I'm gonna need that. Hold on, I'm getting a text."
282,00:15:04,00:15:08,Coach Burns' wife just got back into town-- she was in Tahoe.
283,00:15:08,00:15:10,I'm going to interview her at the P.D.
284,00:15:10,00:15:12,"Okay, we're all done here, Charlie."
285,00:15:12,00:15:18,"But you understand the seriousness of this, right? We have to follow every possible lead-- don't go anywhere."
286,00:15:19,00:15:20,(door opens)
287,00:15:20,00:15:22,(door closes)
288,00:15:22,00:15:26,"Look, Dad, it... it's not like I didn't want to tell you about what happened with Coach."
289,00:15:26,00:15:28,"And besides, I didn't think it was pertinent."
290,00:15:28,00:15:30,Pertinent?
291,00:15:30,00:15:33,"The man was murdered, Charlie, hours after you physically assaulted him!"
292,00:15:33,00:15:35,What could be more pertinent than that?
293,00:15:35,00:15:37,I punched him. He deserved it.
294,00:15:37,00:15:39,"You know, that's another conversation."
295,00:15:39,00:15:45,"Right now my problem is, you are a suspect in a homicide investigation."
296,00:15:45,00:15:46,"I mean, you know what really pisses me off?"
297,00:15:46,00:15:50,I had to find out about that from a witness in an interrogation room.
298,00:15:50,00:15:53,"Am I really a suspect? Yeah, you are. You lied."
299,00:15:53,00:15:55,I didn't lie; I just didn't tell you.
300,00:15:55,00:15:56,Don't--don't do that. Come on.
301,00:15:56,00:15:59,We didn't raise you like that.
302,00:15:59,00:16:04,"How many times have I told you, there's nothing that could happen in the world that you couldn't come and tell me about."
303,00:16:04,00:16:08,"You also told me to be my own person, to fight my own fights, to live my own life, Dad."
304,00:16:08,00:16:13,"If you don't know the difference between being independent and being honest, then I don't know what to say to you."
305,00:16:13,00:16:15,I really don't.
306,00:16:15,00:16:18,"(door opens, shuts)"
307,00:16:18,00:16:20,(footsteps clopping)
308,00:16:34,00:16:35,BRODY: Something's different about you.
309,00:16:37,00:16:39,Did you get a haircut?
310,00:16:39,00:16:41,Heels.
311,00:16:41,00:16:43,Something you want to tell me?
312,00:16:43,00:16:44,Yes.
313,00:16:44,00:16:50,I have identified... one set of shoe impressions from our crime scene. Heels.
314,00:16:50,00:16:53,Sara was right-- running from the scene. Fast women.
315,00:16:53,00:16:55,Always dangerous.
316,00:16:55,00:16:57,What about the other shoe impressions?
317,00:16:57,00:17:01,"Well, Finlay seems to think that they're from some sort of athletic shoe or a cleat."
318,00:17:01,00:17:03,So far...
319,00:17:03,00:17:10,"I got nothing. Well, you know, the database is only updated every six months, so there's probably some that aren't in there yet."
320,00:17:10,00:17:12,Mm. You might have to go on a shopping spree.
321,00:17:12,00:17:13,Want to go with?
322,00:17:13,00:17:15,Sure.
323,00:17:15,00:17:17,But isn't there one stop you need to make first?
324,00:17:17,00:17:19,Where's that?
325,00:17:19,00:17:23,"Charlie Russell is a suspect, so..."
326,00:17:23,00:17:28,you're gonna have to raid his closet and... you're gonna have to clear it with his dad.
327,00:17:28,00:17:31,Hmm. Not a good day to ask for a raise.
328,00:17:31,00:17:33,Mrs. Burns...
329,00:17:33,00:17:35,I'm sorry for your loss.
330,00:17:35,00:17:37,I need to ask you some questions.
331,00:17:37,00:17:40,"I understand. Now, you said you were in Tahoe last night."
332,00:17:40,00:17:43,I went up there on Wednesday to close up our cabin.
333,00:17:43,00:17:47,"Once basketball season starts, there's really no time for weekend getaways."
334,00:17:47,00:17:52,I got back this afternoon-- that's when I got your message.
335,00:17:52,00:17:53,About Tom.
336,00:17:53,00:17:56,So when was the last time you two spoke?
337,00:17:56,00:17:57,A few days ago.
338,00:17:59,00:18:01,"I know what you're thinking, but for us, that was normal."
339,00:18:01,00:18:04,Especially at this time of year.
340,00:18:04,00:18:07,Tom was always so focused on getting ready for the season.
341,00:18:07,00:18:10,"So no problems with your marriage, then?"
342,00:18:10,00:18:17,"We had our struggles, but unlike most men, he was at least willing to work on our relationship, go to couples therapy."
343,00:18:17,00:18:19,How was that working out?
344,00:18:19,00:18:21,It was good.
345,00:18:21,00:18:23,Things were...
346,00:18:23,00:18:25,improving.
347,00:18:25,00:18:32,"Mrs. Burns, I'm gonna need a sample of your DNA and permission to search your house."
348,00:18:32,00:18:34,It's standard procedure.
349,00:18:34,00:18:37,"I didn't kill my husband, Detective."
350,00:18:37,00:18:38,I'm not saying you did.
351,00:18:38,00:18:40,Sure.
352,00:18:40,00:18:42,Whatever you need.
353,00:18:42,00:18:46,RUSSELL: This is some of the stuff we found in Coach Burns' house.
354,00:18:46,00:18:48,"You're sure these, uh..."
355,00:18:48,00:18:51,"these, these things belonged to him?"
356,00:18:51,00:18:55,These sex toys? FINLAY: We definitely found them in Coach Burns' house.
357,00:18:55,00:18:57,"Actually, in his man cave in the basement."
358,00:18:57,00:19:00,His wife said that it was a home office.
359,00:19:00,00:19:02,I'm assuming you had no idea about his hobby.
360,00:19:02,00:19:04,"No, of course not. Right."
361,00:19:04,00:19:07,"I-I assume you'll be, uh, discreet about this."
362,00:19:07,00:19:11,This sort of information could do irreparable damage to the university.
363,00:19:11,00:19:19,"I understand your concern, and I share it-- my son goes to your school-- but our job's not to protect the university, it's to find out who killed the coach."
364,00:19:19,00:19:21,I thought I knew the man.
365,00:19:21,00:19:22,"Well, so did I."
366,00:19:22,00:19:25,"Thanks for your time, President Austin. Thank you."
367,00:19:27,00:19:30,"(groans) Okay, uh... (sighs)"
368,00:19:30,00:19:31,what else did you find?
369,00:19:31,00:19:33,I ALS'd the bedroom.
370,00:19:33,00:19:35,It lit up like the Strip.
371,00:19:35,00:19:37,"Well, his wife was away for several days, she said."
372,00:19:37,00:19:39,"Yeah, when the wife's away, the coach will play."
373,00:19:39,00:19:41,Tell Henry to get to work.
374,00:19:41,00:19:44,Let's find out who he's been playing with.
375,00:19:44,00:19:46,"VANESSA: Thank you so much for dinner, Mrs. Russell."
376,00:19:46,00:19:48,It was lovely. You're very welcome.
377,00:19:48,00:19:51,"So, Vanessa, are you a graduate student?"
378,00:19:51,00:19:53,Going for my master's in psychology.
379,00:19:53,00:19:56,"I assume, in your work, psychology often comes into play?"
380,00:19:56,00:20:00,"Yeah, yeah, I'm usually dealing with people at their worst, so..."
381,00:20:00,00:20:04,I bet. It's a tragedy with Coach Burns-- it's so awful.
382,00:20:04,00:20:10,"Do you have any idea yet what happened or--or who could have done something like this? Actually, I can't talk about an ongoing investigation."
383,00:20:10,00:20:12,"Oh, right, of course. Sorry."
384,00:20:12,00:20:16,"CHARLIE: Uh, so, Mom, Dad..."
385,00:20:16,00:20:21,"Vanessa and I have been talking, and...we have decided to move in together."
386,00:20:24,00:20:28,"I know it's soon, but... no secrets, right?"
387,00:20:28,00:20:29,Right.
388,00:20:31,00:20:34,"Oh, my, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize how late it was."
389,00:20:34,00:20:39,"I'm leading a discussion section in the morning, so I got to go. I should get back, too, actually. Okay."
390,00:20:39,00:20:41,Nice to see you again.
391,00:20:41,00:20:43,You too.
392,00:20:43,00:20:44,"Yes, we need Thank you."
393,00:20:44,00:20:46,to do this again sometime.
394,00:20:51,00:20:53,(music blasting)
395,00:20:53,00:20:54,Ouch!
396,00:21:19,00:21:22,I--I think you need a little more wrist there.
397,00:21:22,00:21:24,(turns off music)
398,00:21:24,00:21:26,You better have my DNA results.
399,00:21:26,00:21:29,"Sorry, I was just waiting for, uh, for that."
400,00:21:29,00:21:33,Coach Burns was a naughty boy.
401,00:21:33,00:21:36,DNA from our sex toys and the sheets in Coach's bedroom.
402,00:21:36,00:21:39,Two contributors: Coach and...
403,00:21:39,00:21:40,someone not his wife.
404,00:21:40,00:21:45,"RUSSELL: ""Unknown female."" Maybe moving up our suspect list. Why do you say that?"
405,00:21:45,00:21:50,Doc took I.R. photos of the bruising on Coach Burns' chest and back.
406,00:21:52,00:21:55,Guess we know how he got those nasty bruises.
407,00:21:55,00:22:00,"Getting nasty. Whoever was riding him in bed, maybe it's the same person who dropped him in the shower."
408,00:22:00,00:22:05,"Having fun in bed's a long way from bludgeoning somebody to death in a shower, don't you think?"
409,00:22:05,00:22:08,"But it is our best lead, so...all right."
410,00:22:08,00:22:10,Let's find out who this unknown female is.
411,00:22:12,00:22:13,"Hey, Russell? Yeah?"
412,00:22:13,00:22:15,Come here for a sec.
413,00:22:15,00:22:16,What you got?
414,00:22:16,00:22:18,I got Burns' cell phone records.
415,00:22:18,00:22:25,"Now, I know these guys chase recruits, but this is ridiculous. He made, like, over 200 phone calls in one day, and even more than that in text messages."
416,00:22:25,00:22:27,Forget about the recruits.
417,00:22:27,00:22:29,We're looking for a woman now that's good with a riding crop.
418,00:22:29,00:22:31,"Oh, really? Well, hold on."
419,00:22:31,00:22:32,This may interest you.
420,00:22:32,00:22:37,"On the night before the murder, Burns made three phone calls, all with the same number; disposable phone."
421,00:22:37,00:22:40,And a text--look at this.
422,00:22:40,00:22:47,"RUSSELL: ""Feeling naughty. Need some discipline."" Ten minutes later, he gets this message back: ""Can't make it to your place."
423,00:22:47,00:22:49,"""Find me at The Iris. Obey."
424,00:22:49,00:22:52,"Mistress Z."" Sounds like our girl to me."
425,00:22:54,00:22:57,You know anything about The Iris?
426,00:22:57,00:23:00,"No, but that information's pretty easy to get."
427,00:23:06,00:23:08,WOMAN: There you are.
428,00:23:11,00:23:12,WOMAN: This way.
429,00:23:12,00:23:14,MAN: Nighty-night.
430,00:23:14,00:23:16,"Good evening, gentlemen."
431,00:23:16,00:23:19,Hi. Evening.
432,00:23:19,00:23:22,"Well, Lily said that you were looking for something special."
433,00:23:22,00:23:24,"Yeah, my buddy here needs a little, um..."
434,00:23:24,00:23:25,a little discipline.
435,00:23:25,00:23:29,"STOKES: Yeah. Yeah, I heard Mistress Z really knows how to punish a man."
436,00:23:29,00:23:31,I'm sorry.
437,00:23:31,00:23:33,Are you on the list?
438,00:23:33,00:23:35,"Uh... Uh, no, we're not, actually."
439,00:23:35,00:23:36,A friend of ours sent us here.
440,00:23:36,00:23:37,Tom Burns.
441,00:23:39,00:23:41,I think you need to leave.
442,00:23:41,00:23:43,Mm. I think we're gonna stay.
443,00:23:43,00:23:46,Seeing as how we're with the crime lab.
444,00:23:46,00:23:48,You want me to just...? I can set it right here.
445,00:23:48,00:23:51,"No, it's fine."
446,00:23:51,00:23:52,Right this way.
447,00:23:52,00:23:54,Okeydoke.
448,00:24:00,00:24:04,"Mistress Z, these gentlemen would like to have a word."
449,00:24:04,00:24:07,"Gentlemen, what can I do for...?"
450,00:24:11,00:24:13,"Nice to see you, Mr. Russell."
451,00:24:16,00:24:17,This is awkward.
452,00:24:17,00:24:21,"Oh, it's a lot more than that, actually."
453,00:24:26,00:24:29,"So, what do we call you?"
454,00:24:29,00:24:30,Mistress Z?
455,00:24:30,00:24:32,Vanessa?
456,00:24:32,00:24:33,What is it you wanted to talk to me about?
457,00:24:33,00:24:35,STOKES: Coach Tom Burns.
458,00:24:35,00:24:38,Phone records indicate that you two had an ongoing relationship-- is that right?
459,00:24:38,00:24:40,Not sure I'd characterize it that way.
460,00:24:40,00:24:42,"Yeah, neither would I."
461,00:24:42,00:24:45,Coach Burns had bruises all over his body.
462,00:24:45,00:24:48,I'm assuming it was you who... disciplined him?
463,00:24:48,00:24:51,Tom Burns was a client. Ah.
464,00:24:51,00:24:52,Client. That's what you call it.
465,00:24:52,00:24:56,STOKES: We found evidence of a woman at the crime scene.
466,00:24:56,00:24:57,Where were you at 5:00 a.m. this morning?
467,00:24:57,00:25:00,Why don't you ask Mr. Russell's son?
468,00:25:03,00:25:07,"Charlie said that he went to work out, and left you in his bed."
469,00:25:07,00:25:09,That's true.
470,00:25:09,00:25:14,"I... I slept in until about 6:15, and then we got an early breakfast."
471,00:25:14,00:25:16,Ah.
472,00:25:16,00:25:20,I didn't kill Tom Burns.
473,00:25:20,00:25:22,"Well, if you didn't, maybe you know who did then."
474,00:25:22,00:25:30,This was a crime of passion; this guy was beaten to death. Maybe one of your clients got jealous 'cause he couldn't have you all to himself.
475,00:25:30,00:25:32,I have nothing more to say.
476,00:25:32,00:25:35,"Well, you know, we could drive you downtown... Vanessa."
477,00:25:35,00:25:38,We could book you for solicitation.
478,00:25:38,00:25:40,"I am not a hooker, Mr. Russell."
479,00:25:40,00:25:41,No? What are you then?
480,00:25:41,00:25:47,"I am a licensed sex therapist, which, aside from being perfectly legal, also entitles me to therapist-patient privilege."
481,00:25:47,00:25:49,I don't have to tell you anything.
482,00:25:49,00:25:53,So you're telling me that all these women running around in here are licensed therapists?
483,00:25:53,00:25:58,"Yes, they are. You can book a session with any one of them if you feel the need."
484,00:25:58,00:26:01,Does my son know what you do?
485,00:26:01,00:26:03,Like I said...
486,00:26:03,00:26:05,I have nothing more to say.
487,00:26:14,00:26:16,"Oh, I didn't hear you come in last night."
488,00:26:16,00:26:17,(grunts)
489,00:26:17,00:26:19,Didn't want to wake you.
490,00:26:19,00:26:21,(gentle laugh) Hey.
491,00:26:22,00:26:24,I was up all night...
492,00:26:24,00:26:27,"thinking about Charlie, Vanessa."
493,00:26:27,00:26:29,I'm with you on that one.
494,00:26:29,00:26:31,Just seems so early for them to move in together.
495,00:26:31,00:26:33,They barely know each other.
496,00:26:33,00:26:36,Did you run the dishwasher last night?
497,00:26:36,00:26:38,No. Why?
498,00:26:38,00:26:40,Just asking.
499,00:26:40,00:26:44,I guess that's the danger of raising an independent child.
500,00:26:44,00:26:45,You might actually succeed.
501,00:26:45,00:26:49,"I guess it is their decision to make, right?"
502,00:26:49,00:26:55,"I mean, where would we be if we'd waited for my parents to approve of you?"
503,00:26:55,00:26:57,Is that's Vanessa's wine glass?
504,00:26:57,00:27:01,You are not seriously going to run her DNA?
505,00:27:01,00:27:03,Are you gonna do a background check?
506,00:27:03,00:27:06,"Trust me on this one, Detective."
507,00:27:06,00:27:07,What does that mean?
508,00:27:07,00:27:09,It means trust me.
509,00:27:09,00:27:11,I'll call you.
510,00:27:13,00:27:17,I just had the strangest experience.
511,00:27:17,00:27:26,I found Henry swabbing a wine glass that you quietly slipped him in order to obtain a potential suspect's DNA.
512,00:27:26,00:27:32,"I hope you got a warrant, because, as I recall, I was fired by my boss in Seattle for doing the exact same thing."
513,00:27:32,00:27:35,"Are you through? No, no, no, no."
514,00:27:35,00:27:38,I have a lot more things I'd like to say. 'Cause it's not the same thing.
515,00:27:38,00:27:45,"It's my wine glass in my house, and-and-and the DNA happens to come from a hooker who's banging my son."
516,00:27:45,00:27:46,"So, no, not the same thing."
517,00:27:49,00:27:50,"Well, your suspicions were confirmed."
518,00:27:50,00:27:54,What do you mean? The DNA matched our unknown female.
519,00:27:54,00:27:58,Vanessa was definitely sleeping with the coach.
520,00:27:58,00:28:00,That's great.
521,00:28:00,00:28:08,"So, my-my son is in a love triangle involving his coach, who, you know, he happened to have a violent confrontation with just hours before the man was killed, and..."
522,00:28:08,00:28:15,"shoe impressions at the scene suggest a woman and somebody else, and the someone else's footwear looks like it could be an athlete."
523,00:28:15,00:28:17,So it just gets better and better.
524,00:28:17,00:28:23,"Hodges analyzed all of Charlie's shoes, and none of them fit the mystery pattern."
525,00:28:23,00:28:26,"D.B., I've known your son since he was ten."
526,00:28:26,00:28:29,There is no way that he is a killer.
527,00:28:29,00:28:30,(sighs)
528,00:28:30,00:28:33,I--I know that. I know that.
529,00:28:33,00:28:35,But he's keeping something from me.
530,00:28:35,00:28:39,"And you know, it wouldn't be the first time some idiot kid did something stupid for love."
531,00:28:39,00:28:42,Do you think he's lying to protect Vanessa?
532,00:28:42,00:28:43,"I have no idea, but I'll tell you something."
533,00:28:43,00:28:47,"If he wasn't my son, he'd be sitting in a jail cell right now."
534,00:28:47,00:28:49,We need to figure this out.
535,00:28:49,00:28:51,We don't even have a murder weapon yet.
536,00:28:51,00:28:53,And there are so many suspects still in play.
537,00:28:53,00:28:55,What are we missing? We're missing something.
538,00:28:55,00:28:57,What is this?
539,00:28:57,00:28:59,What's the white substance on the coach's forehead?
540,00:28:59,00:29:01,"It's a biological, but that's about it."
541,00:29:01,00:29:05,"Henry ran a quant, and there wasn't sufficient DNA to even generate a profile."
542,00:29:05,00:29:08,What about Trace?
543,00:29:08,00:29:10,"Um, Hodges, I asked you a question."
544,00:29:10,00:29:13,Yes. And I heard you.
545,00:29:15,00:29:17,Struck out again.
546,00:29:19,00:29:21,"Okay, uh... what did you ask me?"
547,00:29:21,00:29:22,The dried substance?
548,00:29:22,00:29:24,Oh.
549,00:29:24,00:29:25,Yeah. It's all in there.
550,00:29:25,00:29:28,I know you were counting on semen.
551,00:29:28,00:29:30,It was a teardrop?
552,00:29:30,00:29:33,Not just any teardrop-- an emotional one.
553,00:29:33,00:29:35,An emotional teardrop? Seriously?
554,00:29:35,00:29:37,"I mean, how can you even tell that? That's..."
555,00:29:37,00:29:38,Science.
556,00:29:38,00:29:43,Emotional tears have a different composition than irritant-induced tears.
557,00:29:43,00:29:50,"Emotional tears exhibit 25% higher concentrations in proteins, enzymes, lipids, lysozymes, and electrolytes."
558,00:29:50,00:29:52,"So, someone cried over the victim."
559,00:29:52,00:29:54,I'm not sure how that helps us.
560,00:29:54,00:29:57,Refer to page four.
561,00:29:57,00:30:05,"Perhaps the owner of our tear was not only mourning Coach Burns, but also mourning a lost vigor of lash."
562,00:30:05,00:30:07,Tear contained bimatoprost?
563,00:30:07,00:30:12,A synthetic prostaglandin and a key component in a prescription drug that helps promote eyelash growth.
564,00:30:12,00:30:14,Longessa.
565,00:30:14,00:30:17,"Does that help you? Yes, it does. Thank you."
566,00:30:24,00:30:26,(Hodges sighs)
567,00:30:26,00:30:27,Damn it.
568,00:30:27,00:30:29,You ever think maybe not a shoe?
569,00:30:34,00:30:35,I hate you.
570,00:30:39,00:30:40,(sighs)
571,00:30:44,00:30:46,What's this? Longessa.
572,00:30:46,00:30:49,Found a six-month supply when we searched the Burns' home.
573,00:30:49,00:30:50,Eyelash ointment.
574,00:30:50,00:30:51,Uh-huh.
575,00:30:51,00:30:54,Prescribed to Mrs. Burns.
576,00:30:54,00:30:57,You know that dried substance that we found on the coach's forehead?
577,00:30:57,00:31:00,"Well, turns out it was a tear with traces of Longessa."
578,00:31:00,00:31:04,"That puts the wife in the shower, standing over her dead husband's body."
579,00:31:04,00:31:06,"Question is, who was she with?"
580,00:31:06,00:31:09,"Well, I checked the Burns' cell phone records."
581,00:31:09,00:31:13,There's a consistent pattern of calls between Mrs. Burns and Jack Oxford.
582,00:31:13,00:31:15,Oxford? Mm.
583,00:31:15,00:31:16,WLVU's favorite booster?
584,00:31:16,00:31:20,"Well, maybe he was boosting something else."
585,00:31:20,00:31:24,"Oxford sleeping with the coach's wife, but the coach has his own thing going on with Vanessa."
586,00:31:24,00:31:26,Everybody should be happy.
587,00:31:26,00:31:27,In theory.
588,00:31:27,00:31:31,"But, uh, simple math gets complicated sometimes, when passions are involved."
589,00:31:31,00:31:33,"Okay, I'll call Brass."
590,00:31:33,00:31:36,I think it's time we talk to the booster and the widow.
591,00:31:36,00:31:40,Go get 'em.
592,00:31:40,00:31:42,Jim?
593,00:31:42,00:31:43,"Yeah, Nick, I hear you."
594,00:31:43,00:31:47,I'll send some officers to Burns' house to pick up his wife.
595,00:31:47,00:31:53,"But as far as grabbing Jack Oxford and taking him to the station, that's not gonna happen."
596,00:31:53,00:31:55,Somebody took him out of the game.
597,00:32:00,00:32:01,BRASS: Ouch. That's a one-and-one.
598,00:32:01,00:32:03,Must have been in the penalty.
599,00:32:03,00:32:06,Two shots fired from a gun registered to you.
600,00:32:06,00:32:09,Recovered from a trash can right outside the gym.
601,00:32:09,00:32:11,"BRASS: So, thanks for making our job so easy."
602,00:32:11,00:32:17,To put a bullet in a guy's manhood-- good luck with a jury.
603,00:32:17,00:32:19,You sure you don't want to call your lawyer now?
604,00:32:19,00:32:22,"I don't need a lawyer, because I haven't done anything wrong."
605,00:32:22,00:32:24,In the eyes of God?
606,00:32:24,00:32:26,I don't think so.
607,00:32:26,00:32:28,State of Nevada looks pretty bad too.
608,00:32:28,00:32:31,SANDERS: Phone calls between you and Oxford.
609,00:32:31,00:32:35,DNA from his house puts you in his bed.
610,00:32:35,00:32:38,"Now, as far as your husband's murder..."
611,00:32:38,00:32:41,Shoes from your closet match shoe impressions from the scene.
612,00:32:41,00:32:45,And Trace report says that you shed a tear over his body.
613,00:32:45,00:32:46,BRASS: How touching.
614,00:32:46,00:32:47,And incriminating.
615,00:32:47,00:32:49,I didn't kill anyone.
616,00:32:51,00:32:54,But I was there at the gym that morning.
617,00:32:54,00:32:57,"Yes, I was having an affair with Oxford."
618,00:32:57,00:32:59,It was just a fling.
619,00:32:59,00:33:02,I knew Tom was seeking...
620,00:33:02,00:33:04,professional company with that woman.
621,00:33:04,00:33:08,"For a while, it worked for both of us."
622,00:33:08,00:33:09,And then...
623,00:33:09,00:33:10,it didn't.
624,00:33:10,00:33:15,"That morning, we were supposed to get coffee and talk about mending what was broken."
625,00:33:15,00:33:18,I went looking for him in the locker room.
626,00:33:18,00:33:19,I heard the shower running.
627,00:33:19,00:33:21,That's when I saw him.
628,00:33:28,00:33:30,"Well, it's a good thing you called the cops."
629,00:33:30,00:33:31,Oh...
630,00:33:31,00:33:34,"wait a minute, sorry-- my bad--you didn't."
631,00:33:34,00:33:37,"No, instead you made up a story about being in Tahoe."
632,00:33:37,00:33:40,"I shouldn't have lied. The thing is, I knew who did it."
633,00:33:40,00:33:42,At least I thought I did.
634,00:33:42,00:33:44,I couldn't bear the scandal.
635,00:33:44,00:33:45,What are you talking about?
636,00:33:45,00:33:47,Oxford was furious with Tom.
637,00:33:47,00:33:48,They'd had a number of confrontations.
638,00:33:48,00:33:50,Over you?
639,00:33:50,00:33:51,"No, over his son Eli."
640,00:33:51,00:33:54,He was trying to get him on the team--Tom refused.
641,00:33:54,00:33:56,Said some things money couldn't buy.
642,00:33:57,00:33:59,That's a good story.
643,00:33:59,00:34:03,Especially since Jack Oxford and your husband are both dead.
644,00:34:03,00:34:05,Dead men tell no tales.
645,00:34:06,00:34:08,I'm telling you the truth.
646,00:34:08,00:34:10,"And I'm telling you, you really should call your lawyer now."
647,00:34:12,00:34:13,"HODGES: Hey, boss!"
648,00:34:13,00:34:17,"I heard that, uh, Mrs. Burns just got booked."
649,00:34:17,00:34:20,So I guess my travails in high heels and crocodile tears paid off?
650,00:34:20,00:34:28,"Yeah, the D.A.'s going forward but Mrs. Burns is claiming that Oxford killed her husband, and then someone shot Oxford using her gun."
651,00:34:28,00:34:29,Sounds pretty thin.
652,00:34:29,00:34:31,Except for the fact that...
653,00:34:31,00:34:32,her gun was wiped clean.
654,00:34:32,00:34:38,"We still don't know what was used to bludgeon the coach to death, so, forensically, we can't place either weapon in her hand."
655,00:34:38,00:34:40,So it's back to you--your...
656,00:34:40,00:34:43,travails yield anything on our mystery impressions?
657,00:34:43,00:34:45,I'm still working on it.
658,00:34:45,00:34:51,I have eliminated all shoe possibilities and all other sundry and slightly repulsive locker room possibilities.
659,00:34:51,00:34:52,"So, back to work."
660,00:34:52,00:34:54,"Oh, hey, um..."
661,00:34:54,00:34:58,"for what it's worth, I knew Charlie had nothing to do with this."
662,00:34:58,00:35:00,Thank you. Mm-hmm.
663,00:35:01,00:35:03,Okay...
664,00:35:07,00:35:09,Hey.
665,00:35:09,00:35:11,That was a good day.
666,00:35:11,00:35:12,RUSSELL: Proud day.
667,00:35:12,00:35:14,First game as a starter.
668,00:35:16,00:35:18,Rumors are all over campus.
669,00:35:18,00:35:21,"About Coach, his wife, Jack Oxford."
670,00:35:21,00:35:24,T.J. says the program's screwed.
671,00:35:24,00:35:27,Some of the players are starting to get calls from other schools.
672,00:35:29,00:35:31,Are you getting calls?
673,00:35:31,00:35:32,A couple.
674,00:35:32,00:35:35,Okay.
675,00:35:35,00:35:37,(sighs)
676,00:35:37,00:35:38,What are you gonna do?
677,00:35:39,00:35:41,What do you think I should do?
678,00:35:41,00:35:43,Not the question.
679,00:35:43,00:35:45,"I know you're pissed off at me, Dad."
680,00:35:46,00:35:50,"No. I'm not pissed, Charlie. I'm--I'm..."
681,00:35:50,00:35:51,"disappointed, that's all."
682,00:35:54,00:35:57,"(sighing): All right, I think we need to talk about Vanessa."
683,00:35:57,00:36:01,Why bother? She broke up with me out of the blue.
684,00:36:01,00:36:03,And said she got a job at another school.
685,00:36:03,00:36:07,"One day, we're madly in love, moving in together, and the next day she's gone."
686,00:36:09,00:36:12,What is it you always say?
687,00:36:12,00:36:15,"""Wisdom comes through struggle."" (sighs)"
688,00:36:15,00:36:17,"Well, that's easy to say."
689,00:36:19,00:36:21,Think I'm gonna keep struggling here in Vegas.
690,00:36:23,00:36:27,"Hell, if guys like T.J. leave, I should get some playing time, right?"
691,00:36:29,00:36:31,More good days ahead.
692,00:36:31,00:36:32,Dinner Sunday?
693,00:36:32,00:36:34,"Yeah, I'm in."
694,00:36:40,00:36:42,Hmm.
695,00:37:31,00:37:34,I think Russell's hunch was right.
696,00:37:34,00:37:35,"Well, maybe right."
697,00:37:35,00:37:37,Least he was in the... ballpark.
698,00:37:38,00:37:40,"Come on, that was a good one."
699,00:37:40,00:37:47,"Based on the consistent repeating pattern, the location of the crime scene, I definitely think our mystery object is a ball."
700,00:37:47,00:37:48,"Yes, but... (sighs)"
701,00:37:48,00:37:50,it's not a basketball.
702,00:37:50,00:37:52,Or at least not one of these basketballs.
703,00:37:52,00:37:54,"They all created tiny, dimpled patterns and..."
704,00:37:54,00:37:57,rolled or bounced in a reasonably straight line.
705,00:37:57,00:38:03,"Yeah, pattern at the scene was smooth, no dimples, and the path was jagged, irregular."
706,00:38:03,00:38:04,You see something?
707,00:38:07,00:38:08,Ugh.
708,00:38:08,00:38:10,I hate me right now.
709,00:38:10,00:38:12,What are you talking about?
710,00:38:12,00:38:15,This detail in the impression...
711,00:38:15,00:38:17,does it look like it could've been caused...
712,00:38:17,00:38:19,by a lace? Yeah.
713,00:38:19,00:38:21,Maybe.
714,00:38:21,00:38:22,Why?
715,00:38:22,00:38:23,(chuckles)
716,00:38:23,00:38:26,A little roll down memory lane.
717,00:38:26,00:38:29,"Prior to 1948, all basketballs had laces."
718,00:38:29,00:38:31,Not unlike this replica here.
719,00:38:31,00:38:37,"The laces were crude, hand-stitched, and irregular shape-- didn't matter, because back then the goal was to pass, not to dribble."
720,00:38:37,00:38:39,"Just roll the ball, please."
721,00:38:39,00:38:42,A little historical perspective never hurt.
722,00:38:52,00:38:54,"Wow. Well, it sure looks like a match to me."
723,00:38:54,00:38:56,"Same general characteristics, spacing..."
724,00:38:56,00:38:58,I agree.
725,00:38:58,00:39:02,"Okay, so, an antique basketball rolled through Coach Burns' blood..."
726,00:39:02,00:39:03,How does that happen?
727,00:39:03,00:39:04,Don't know.
728,00:39:04,00:39:06,What we do know is...
729,00:39:06,00:39:08,that antique basketballs...
730,00:39:08,00:39:13,"are often showcased on heavy, rectangular display cases like this."
731,00:39:13,00:39:15,"Flat surfaces, sharp edges."
732,00:39:15,00:39:20,Would explain the two types of wound patterns that Doc found on Coach Burns' face and head.
733,00:39:20,00:39:23,I assume basketballs this old are rare. Very.
734,00:39:23,00:39:26,Can't be too many people in Vegas who own one.
735,00:39:34,00:39:38,"The next time you bring your basketball to a murder, you might want to..."
736,00:39:38,00:39:39,think about getting rid of it.
737,00:39:39,00:39:42,Even if it is worth 85 grand.
738,00:39:42,00:39:49,"FINLAY: Yeah, we swabbed the ball and the display stand that we found in your office, and it came back positive for Coach Burns' blood."
739,00:39:49,00:39:53,Burns was a stubborn son of a bitch.
740,00:39:53,00:39:59,I asked him for one thing: Put Jack Oxford's kid on the team.
741,00:39:59,00:40:01,I'm trying to take a damn shower here.
742,00:40:01,00:40:03,"Just put him on the team, Tom."
743,00:40:03,00:40:06,Please. Who cares if he can't play? Let him ride the bench.
744,00:40:06,00:40:07,Nobody tells me who to recruit.
745,00:40:07,00:40:09,"I need this, Tom."
746,00:40:09,00:40:10,Oxford's our biggest donor.
747,00:40:10,00:40:12,I'll never ask again. I promise.
748,00:40:15,00:40:18,This is one of the first basketballs ever made--1894.
749,00:40:18,00:40:21,Signed by James Naismith.
750,00:40:21,00:40:24,"I want you to have it. You're pathetic, you know that?"
751,00:40:24,00:40:26,Who the hell do you think you are?
752,00:40:26,00:40:27,You work for me.
753,00:40:27,00:40:29,I'm the face of this university.
754,00:40:29,00:40:30,This brand.
755,00:40:30,00:40:32,Not you. You're just some...
756,00:40:32,00:40:35,"Ivy League pimp with his hand out, looking for cash."
757,00:40:37,00:40:38,"Now, you get the hell out here."
758,00:40:41,00:40:43,AUSTIN: Oxford gave millions to WLVU.
759,00:40:45,00:40:48,"Coach Burns got the glory, but I did all the hard work."
760,00:40:48,00:40:52,"FINLAY: Sucking up to donors, and always having to make them happy."
761,00:40:52,00:40:54,"And when they're not, they pull their cash."
762,00:40:54,00:40:55,Then it's my fault.
763,00:40:55,00:40:57,My ass on the line.
764,00:40:59,00:41:00,But Burns couldn't care less.
765,00:41:01,00:41:03,"(grunting, squishing)"
766,00:41:10,00:41:12,(grunts)
767,00:41:16,00:41:18,"And as I was leaving, I saw Linda driving up."
768,00:41:20,00:41:24,And I knew she was having an affair with Oxford.
769,00:41:24,00:41:27,"I knew she had a gun, and I needed a way out."
770,00:41:27,00:41:31,"And you probably hated Jack, so killing him and setting up the wife, that's a two-fer, right?"
771,00:41:31,00:41:40,"So you snuck into Coach Burns' house, you stole his gun and then you shot the biggest booster in WLVU's history."
772,00:41:40,00:41:42,That's irony.
773,00:41:42,00:41:47,At least I think that's the way these academic guys put it.
774,00:41:47,00:41:52,"For 20 years, I've given that school everything."
775,00:41:52,00:41:55,Given it...my life.
776,00:41:55,00:42:00,"And now with a double-homicide, that very same life will belong to the state penitentiary."
777,00:42:05,00:42:07,"So, did the girl love Charlie?"
778,00:42:07,00:42:10,"I think Charlie believed that, yeah."
779,00:42:10,00:42:12,We're going to have to tell him.
780,00:42:12,00:42:13,I know. I know.
781,00:42:15,00:42:18,Why didn't you tell me?
782,00:42:18,00:42:20,There are things that I don't talk to you about.
783,00:42:20,00:42:22,The things that I don't...
784,00:42:22,00:42:24,"I don't bring home, but that was..."
785,00:42:24,00:42:26,"that was our deal, right?"
786,00:42:28,00:42:31,Charlie is our son.
787,00:42:31,00:42:35,You owe it to me to tell me if he's in trouble.
788,00:42:36,00:42:38,You're right.
789,00:42:38,00:42:41,"You need to tell me, anyway."
790,00:42:41,00:42:44,You sure you want that?
791,00:42:44,00:42:46,Given the nature of what I see every day?
792,00:42:46,00:42:49,You need to talk to me about it.
793,00:42:49,00:42:54,"You think you're protecting me, but you're just trying to protect yourself."
794,00:42:54,00:42:56,And that's when we get into trouble.
795,00:42:56,00:42:58,"Promise me, no more secrets."
796,00:43:01,00:43:03,"I know who I married, D.B."
797,00:43:05,00:43:07,I know who I married too.
