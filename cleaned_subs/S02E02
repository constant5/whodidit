0	00:01:17	00:01:20	Yeah?
1	00:01:20	00:01:23	Hold the meter. I'll be right down.
2	00:01:46	00:01:48	Paige Rycoff, freshman.
3	00:01:48	00:01:52	Couldn't stand the heat, dropped out of school.
4	00:01:52	00:01:53	Dropped out of sight.
5	00:01:53	00:01:56	Booked a one-way ticket home to Boulder.
6	00:01:56	00:01:58	Never got there. Four days M.I.A.
7	00:01:58	00:02:02	Missing persons, first 24 hours are gold after that...
8	00:02:02	00:02:04	Quicksand.
9	00:02:04	00:02:06	Hey.
10	00:02:15	00:02:20	Excuse me but could everyone in this room do me a big favor and leave?
11	00:02:22	00:02:24	Please?
12	00:02:24	00:02:25	Thanks, fellas.
13	00:02:27	00:02:28	Thanks, guys.
14	00:02:30	00:02:32	You want me to go, too?
15	00:02:32	00:02:34	If you're very still, you can stay.
16	00:02:40	00:02:42	She was definitely on her way out of here.
17	00:02:45	00:02:45	Lamp's still on.
18	00:02:46	00:02:51	Yeah, but she didn't take her suitcase her purse... or the cab she called.
19	00:02:52	00:02:55	It's like going to the vet without your dog.
20	00:02:55	00:02:58	Maybe she had a change of plan.
21	00:02:58	00:03:01	Or someone changed it for her.
22	00:03:01	00:03:03	No sign of struggle.
23	00:03:03	00:03:04	Everything's intact.
24	00:03:05	00:03:08	Nothing out of place.
25	00:03:20	00:03:22	Come in.
26	00:03:26	00:03:30	Door locks automatically and there were no keys in her purse.
27	00:03:30	00:03:32	Maybe they were in her pocket.
28	00:03:32	00:03:35	If they were in her pocket she could've walked right back in.
29	00:03:35	00:03:36	Why didn't she?
30	00:03:36	00:03:43	One moment Paige Rycoff is here the next, vanished.
31	00:03:43	00:03:45	People don't vanish, Jim.
32	00:03:45	00:03:49	It's a molecular impossibility.
33	00:04:26	00:04:29	They got this multiplex system-- there's eyes all over the place.
34	00:04:30	00:04:34	There's eight floors, and four cameras per floor.
35	00:04:34	00:04:36	They have this system in place when you went to school here?
36	00:04:36	00:04:40	With all the stuff me and my boys got away with it's probably why they have them now.
37	00:04:40	00:04:42	Hey, scent dogs are on their way.
38	00:04:42	00:04:45	If you don't live in the dorm you can't get in.
39	00:04:45	00:04:48	What about getting out?
40	00:04:49	00:04:55	400 students 12 uniform officers, ten minutes per interview.
41	00:04:55	00:04:57	P.D. should be done by Tuesday.
42	00:04:57	00:05:00	Well, I'll take prints over people any day.
43	00:05:00	00:05:02	How about taking video?
44	00:05:02	00:05:05	There's cameras on every floor; one of them must have seen something, please find it.
45	00:05:05	00:05:07	Okay.
46	00:05:08	00:05:11	In this case, more is less-- the more time goes by the less chance we have of finding this girl.
47	00:05:11	00:05:13	Four days?
48	00:05:13	00:05:15	We'd be looking for a body already.
49	00:05:15	00:05:17	Well, hide and seek.
50	00:05:17	00:05:18	Let's go.
51	00:05:20	00:05:21	I talked to her R.A.
52	00:05:22	00:05:26	Paige had put in a request to have all her mail forwarded, including her security deposit.
53	00:05:45	00:05:46	Minty.
54	00:05:46	00:05:49	Toothpaste-- poor man's spackle.
55	00:05:49	00:05:52	It's an old college trick-- covers up the holes when the posters come down.
56	00:05:52	00:05:54	Ah.
57	00:05:54	00:05:56	Leave the room the way you found it, get back your full deposit.
58	00:05:56	00:05:57	$500.
59	00:05:57	00:06:00	That's huge money at her age if you actually get it.
60	00:06:00	00:06:03	That's a big college racket, like buying books back?
61	00:06:03	00:06:06	Why would anyone want to sell their books?
62	00:06:06	00:06:09	Two beds. Roommate?
63	00:06:15	00:06:16	Jennifer Riggs.
64	00:06:16	00:06:20	Left school two weeks into the semester Brass checked with the registrar.
65	00:06:30	00:06:32	Dust void.
66	00:06:35	00:06:37	Something was here.
67	00:06:37	00:06:39	Area rug.
68	00:06:39	00:06:41	Could've been used to conceal a body on the way out.
69	00:06:41	00:06:47	The disappearance of Western Las Vegas University Coed Paige Rycoff has police baffled.
70	00:06:47	00:06:49	They're working on several leads.
71	00:06:49	00:06:52	And though investigators are still...
72	00:06:55	00:06:58	How's this strap right here, is this tight enough?
73	00:06:58	00:06:59	Uh, yeah, fine.
74	00:06:59	00:07:01	How about this one?
75	00:07:01	00:07:02	Yeah, it's... it's good, Warrick.
76	00:07:02	00:07:05	Well, you know, you can get cadets to do this, Cath.
77	00:07:05	00:07:07	I mean, they're used to obstacle courses.
78	00:07:07	00:07:10	Yeah, well, on missing persons, we can't wait.
79	00:07:10	00:07:13	Yeah, well, it looks like a kill-and-dump to me.
80	00:07:13	00:07:18	I mean, the guy waited for the coast to clear Door to door, it's only 10 meters...
81	00:07:28	00:07:31	Hmm, snappy little sucker. Somebody ought to fix that.
82	00:07:31	00:07:32	Yeah?
83	00:07:32	00:07:34	Well, all right, after we find Paige.
84	00:07:34	00:07:35	Right.
85	00:07:42	00:07:45	Okay, here we're looking at the fourth floor.
86	00:07:45	00:07:46	It's real time.
87	00:07:46	00:07:51	Mm-hmm... I'm interested in any camera that covers Paige Rycoff's room.
88	00:07:51	00:07:52	Oh, that's camera two.
89	00:07:54	00:07:56	Here, I'll put it on the large monitor.
90	00:07:58	00:08:06	Now, go back four days, one hour window 00 to 9 Fast forward.
91	00:08:08	00:08:10	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-- hold on.
92	00:08:14	00:08:17	How'd you miss that? We don't catch every minute.
93	00:08:17	00:08:19	Go back 15 seconds, replay in slow-mo.
94	00:08:24	00:08:28	What is that? Camera captures 13% more than we're seeing on this monitor.
95	00:08:28	00:08:31	Picture condenses to fit the aspect ratio...
96	00:08:31	00:08:32	Pixel matrix, yeah. Mm-hmm.
97	00:08:32	00:08:34	Show me the under scan.
98	00:08:37	00:08:38	Stop.
99	00:08:38	00:08:41	Now go back five seconds before the lens was covered.
100	00:08:44	00:08:46	Freeze and magnify.
101	00:08:47	00:08:49	Hmm, somebody's hand.
102	00:08:49	00:08:54	Looks like he pushed off the wall tossed something on the lens.
103	00:08:55	00:08:56	Prints over people.
104	00:08:56	00:08:58	Thanks man.
105	00:08:58	00:08:59	Yeah.
106	00:09:08	00:09:11	Find anything interesting down there?
107	00:09:11	00:09:16	Yeah, plenty, but not what we're looking for.
108	00:09:16	00:09:18	How's the smell, good?
109	00:09:18	00:09:21	Funky.
110	00:09:21	00:09:23	Wait, stop.
111	00:09:23	00:09:24	Stop, stop, stop.
112	00:09:24	00:09:27	What you got?
113	00:09:27	00:09:29	Looks like, uh...
114	00:09:29	00:09:32	something or...
115	00:09:32	00:09:35	someone smashed up against this chute pretty hard.
116	00:09:35	00:09:36	What floor are you on?
117	00:09:36	00:09:37	Uh...
118	00:09:37	00:09:40	Between, um...
119	00:09:40	00:09:42	first and second, I think.
120	00:09:42	00:09:47	Well, if the body was dumped it would've been moving pretty fast by then.
121	00:09:55	00:09:58	Pizza. Keep going.
122	00:10:03	00:10:05	Ah.
123	00:10:05	00:10:07	Touchdown.
124	00:10:09	00:10:12	Uh, chute's clear.
125	00:10:12	00:10:14	Looks like trash is picked up every morning.
126	00:10:14	00:10:18	We got nothing.
127	00:10:18	00:10:23	Hey, Warrick, it looks like we're not the only ones chasing our tails.
128	00:11:49	00:11:52	How did you know where to print?
129	00:11:52	00:11:55	Knew where to look. How about you?
130	00:11:55	00:11:57	DNA, blood and semen.
131	00:11:57	00:11:59	We shoot, we score.
132	00:11:59	00:12:02	No one is telling us anything. It's been four days.
133	00:12:02	00:12:04	I mean, the police aren't talking to us.
134	00:12:04	00:12:05	We have no information.
135	00:12:05	00:12:06	It's gotten crazy.
136	00:12:06	00:12:08	I want to know how this could happen.
137	00:12:09	00:12:09	Mr. Grissom.
138	00:12:10	00:12:12	What are you doing to find my daughter?
139	00:12:12	00:12:13	I'm thinking.
140	00:12:13	00:12:15	How many men are on this case? Have any leads?!
141	00:12:15	00:12:16	Any? Are you looking anywhere else?
142	00:12:16	00:12:18	When we get any new information, I'll let you know.
143	00:12:18	00:12:20	What can we do?
144	00:12:20	00:12:22	Just let me do my job.
145	00:12:22	00:12:25	This is our daughter, we can't just be observers.
146	00:12:25	00:12:26	No, we won't. We're part of this.
147	00:12:26	00:12:27	Look.
148	00:12:27	00:12:36	What no one's telling you is that the only tangible connection you have left between you and your daughter is the evidence that my team is collecting and how we interpret it.
149	00:12:36	00:12:38	So, please...
150	00:12:38	00:12:40	let me think.
151	00:12:56	00:12:58	You showered.
152	00:12:58	00:13:01	Thanks for noticing, Gil, you're very observant.
153	00:13:01	00:13:03	Yeah? Well...
154	00:13:03	00:13:06	I can't tell what I'm observing here.
155	00:13:09	00:13:10	What does that look like?
156	00:13:10	00:13:13	A five-foot-eleven workaholic.
157	00:13:13	00:13:17	Sorry.
158	00:13:17	00:13:20	It looks like somebody carrying... something.
159	00:13:20	00:13:24	Paige Rycoff was missing a rug from her room.
160	00:13:24	00:13:25	Hello.
161	00:13:25	00:13:26	Got an ID off my print.
162	00:13:27	00:13:29	I know who covered the cameras.
163	00:13:29	00:13:30	Good.
164	00:13:30	00:13:33	We know what he might've carried out.
165	00:13:37	00:13:40	It's a hand.
166	00:13:40	00:13:41	It's your hand. ( scoffing )
167	00:13:41	00:13:43	Okay, if you say so.
168	00:13:44	00:13:45	Hey, your fingerprints say so.
169	00:13:48	00:13:51	Okay. I'll cop to it.
170	00:13:53	00:13:55	But I'm not copping to it alone.
171	00:13:58	00:14:00	Pledge prank.
172	00:14:00	00:14:02	You boosted a carpet and a couch?
173	00:14:02	00:14:05	We borrowed-- we borrowed some stuff from the lounge but we were going to return it.
174	00:14:05	00:14:06	When?
175	00:14:06	00:14:07	After you graduate?
176	00:14:07	00:14:09	What else did you take, Henry?
177	00:14:09	00:14:11	Ohhh...
178	00:14:11	00:14:15	Two lamps, coffee table couple rolls of toilet paper.
179	00:14:16	00:14:16	Look, I'll pay for it.
180	00:14:17	00:14:18	Why the fourth floor?
181	00:14:18	00:14:19	Uh...
182	00:14:19	00:14:22	The fourth, fifth and seventh floor have the primo goods.
183	00:14:22	00:14:23	Okay?
184	00:14:23	00:14:26	Fourth floor's closer to the ground less stairs.
185	00:14:26	00:14:31	Faster we can get out of the building and into the van faster we get out of there.
186	00:14:36	00:14:37	Do you know Paige Rycoff?
187	00:14:43	00:14:47	Yeah.
188	00:14:47	00:14:49	Yeah, but I had nothing to do with...
189	00:14:49	00:14:52	with that or whatever happened to her.
190	00:14:52	00:14:54	But you do know her.
191	00:14:54	00:14:55	Well, yeah.
192	00:14:55	00:14:57	You know, we live in the same dorm.
193	00:14:57	00:15:00	We're in Economics 101 together, so what?
194	00:15:00	00:15:04	So what? Paige and I dated once or twice.
195	00:15:04	00:15:06	She wasn't my type.
196	00:15:06	00:15:08	If you haven't noticed...
197	00:15:08	00:15:10	I'm in the system now.
198	00:15:10	00:15:12	The talent pool's pretty deep.
199	00:15:12	00:15:13	She dumped you.
200	00:15:16	00:15:19	Guy like you, it had to be a blow to your ego.
201	00:15:19	00:15:22	Maybe you tried to change her mind.
202	00:15:22	00:15:25	All right, come on, listen. It wasn't like that.
203	00:15:25	00:15:26	It wasn't like that at all.
204	00:15:26	00:15:29	Come on, Paige was seeing another guy.
205	00:15:29	00:15:32	Someone who was more mature than I am.
206	00:15:32	00:15:34	You got a name on this other guy?
207	00:15:34	00:15:38	No. She never said.
208	00:15:42	00:15:43	You can go.
209	00:15:45	00:15:48	But the stuff gets returned.
210	00:15:48	00:15:50	Yes, sir.
211	00:15:53	00:15:56	From hot to cold in a minute.
212	00:15:56	00:16:00	This is the worst place you can be on a missing person... a dead end.
213	00:16:02	00:16:06	The parents of Western Las Vegas University freshman, Paige Rycoff.
214	00:16:06	00:16:09	They join us now to discuss their daughter's disappearance.
215	00:16:10	00:16:15	Mrs. Rycoff, did your daughter tell you why she was leaving school?
216	00:16:15	00:16:20	We're a close family, and Paige just felt she needed to be home... with us.
217	00:16:20	00:16:24	But why leave mid semester?
218	00:16:24	00:16:25	I asked her...
219	00:16:25	00:16:27	She was going to make a fresh start back in Boulder.
220	00:16:28	00:16:30	I need you in the lab.
221	00:16:30	00:16:38	You know, when a tree falls in the forest even if no one's there to hear it it does, in fact, make a sound.
222	00:16:38	00:16:42	Yes. Somebody must have seen or heard something.
223	00:16:42	00:16:44	What have we got?
224	00:16:44	00:16:47	Well, this is one way to get her DNA.
225	00:16:47	00:16:49	Bring me her whole life.
226	00:16:49	00:16:50	It's called zeal, Greg.
227	00:16:50	00:16:52	Or overkill.
228	00:16:52	00:16:53	It's called protocol.
229	00:16:53	00:16:55	Let's get on with it.
230	00:16:56	00:17:00	Okay, well, I, uh, got Paige's DNA from her toothbrush.
231	00:17:00	00:17:04	I compared it to the blood and semen that Sara found on the mattress in her dorm room.
232	00:17:04	00:17:06	Blood's not hers.
233	00:17:06	00:17:07	Not hers? That's not all.
234	00:17:08	00:17:10	Check out the tox screen.
235	00:17:14	00:17:15	Rohypnol?
236	00:17:15	00:17:16	Date rape drug.
237	00:17:16	00:17:18	What about the semen?
238	00:17:19	00:17:22	Well, the vaginal contribution to the semen stain is a match to the blood.
239	00:17:22	00:17:24	Whose blood, don't know.
240	00:17:24	00:17:28	We may have two victims-- one missing, one raped.
241	00:17:30	00:17:33	There's our boys about to move their borrowed furniture.
242	00:17:33	00:17:40	27 p.m.
243	00:17:43	00:17:46	Okay, I think the table's set.
244	00:17:46	00:17:48	Cab double-parked.
245	00:17:48	00:17:49	He calls up.
246	00:17:49	00:17:51	Paige says that she'll be right down.
247	00:17:51	00:17:53	And he becomes the world's most patient cabbie.
248	00:17:55	00:17:58	And just like he tells Brass...
249	00:17:58	00:17:59	he waits 15 minutes.
250	00:17:59	00:18:02	13 minutes. 27 seconds according to the timecode.
251	00:18:02	00:18:03	Close enough.
252	00:18:03	00:18:05	Let's get back out in the field.
253	00:18:05	00:18:06	Tech can finish up here.
254	00:18:06	00:18:07	Hey, where's the fire, Bud?
255	00:18:07	00:18:09	We're just getting started.
256	00:18:09	00:18:12	These security cameras are the only witnesses we've got.
257	00:18:15	00:18:17	I'll, uh, settle in.
258	00:18:17	00:18:18	Good idea.
259	00:18:19	00:18:21	Jennifer Riggs-- missing girl's roommate.
260	00:18:21	00:18:24	She dropped out of school, too about a month and a half ago.
261	00:18:24	00:18:25	That dorm room is cursed.
262	00:18:25	00:18:26	Is this her parents' house?
263	00:18:27	00:18:28	Yeah.
264	00:18:28	00:18:31	Possible sexual assault so I thought I'd wait for the whole team.
265	00:18:31	00:18:34	You thought you should, uh, wait for a female.
266	00:18:34	00:18:41	A video shot during the first week of school offers fresh insight into the 18-year-old's personality.
267	00:18:41	00:18:47	We can see that Paige was an average, apparently happy and healthy freshman, looking forward to...
268	00:18:47	00:18:50	How did you guys even find out about me?
269	00:18:50	00:18:52	I mean, I-I didn't report it.
270	00:18:52	00:18:55	I just... ran.
271	00:18:55	00:18:58	And I left school.
272	00:18:58	00:19:02	Nobody knew, not even Paige.
273	00:19:02	00:19:05	Jennifer, we found forensic evidence in your old dorm room.
274	00:19:05	00:19:12	We believe you were sexually assaulted under the influence of Rohypnol.
275	00:19:12	00:19:18	And now you guys think the guy that attacked me had something to do with Paige's disappearance?
276	00:19:18	00:19:19	Two women.
277	00:19:19	00:19:22	Same dorm room.
278	00:19:22	00:19:24	We're looking for a connection.
279	00:19:27	00:19:29	Will you tell us his name?
280	00:19:32	00:19:36	Do you want to talk alone?
281	00:19:36	00:19:37	You don't understand.
282	00:19:39	00:19:42	I can't remember.
283	00:19:42	00:19:44	I never could remember.
284	00:19:44	00:19:47	That's one of the side effects of Rohypnol.
285	00:19:47	00:19:50	I'm sure he was counting on that.
286	00:19:56	00:19:59	There was this party...
287	00:20:09	00:20:11	Who was at this party?
288	00:20:11	00:20:16	It was a floor party.
289	00:20:16	00:20:20	That's why I had to leave school.
290	00:20:20	00:20:26	Somebody that I was living with attacked me...
291	00:20:26	00:20:29	and I was never going to know who.
292	00:20:35	00:20:38	Why would a rapist voluntarily give up his DNA?
293	00:20:38	00:20:44	Officially, we're looking for the individual who abducted Paige Rycoff not the student who raped Jennifer Riggs.
294	00:20:45	00:20:49	Oh, so as long as the students participate voluntarily we can use their DNA as we see fit.
295	00:20:49	00:20:51	Ah, the old bait and switch.
296	00:20:51	00:20:52	Yo, smart and legal.
297	00:20:52	00:20:54	Yeah, but what if someone refuses?
298	00:20:54	00:20:56	That's what we're hoping for.
299	00:20:56	00:20:58	De facto suspect.
300	00:21:10	00:21:11	Open.
301	00:21:12	00:21:14	Are you refusing?
302	00:21:14	00:21:16	I haven't brushed my teeth.
303	00:21:16	00:21:18	Hey, mouth boy, she's not going to kiss you.
304	00:21:18	00:21:20	She just wants your DNA, okay?
305	00:21:44	00:21:48	Friederich Miescher requests my presence?
306	00:21:48	00:21:50	Figured out my code, huh?
307	00:21:50	00:21:53	Well, you know, my boy Freddy discovered DNA.
308	00:21:53	00:21:56	He's been dead a hundred years, Greg. What do you got?
309	00:21:56	00:21:59	Well, I ran the samples on Cofiler and Profiler Plus.
310	00:21:59	00:22:04	Then I compared each specimen against the types obtained from the dried semen that you found on the victim's mattress...
311	00:22:04	00:22:06	Are we paying you by the word?
312	00:22:15	00:22:17	13 markers.
313	00:22:17	00:22:20	13 matches.
314	00:22:20	00:22:22	One suspect.
315	00:22:22	00:22:23	Thank you.
316	00:22:29	00:22:34	Kevin Watson, 19, room 407 just down the hall from our girls.
317	00:22:34	00:22:37	Athletic director says he plays first base, bats right-handed.
318	00:22:37	00:22:39	Any record?
319	00:22:39	00:22:41	Three Ds and a C, nothing criminal.
320	00:22:41	00:22:44	Number 25, just like McGwire.
321	00:22:44	00:22:47	Yeah? I wonder how he hits.
322	00:22:47	00:22:51	Listen, Kevin, we know that you assaulted Jennifer Riggs.
323	00:22:51	00:22:53	Why don't you just tell us about Paige Rycoff.
324	00:22:53	00:22:56	I don't know anything about Paige... or Jennifer.
325	00:22:56	00:22:58	Well, I'll tell you what I know.
326	00:22:58	00:23:00	Jennifer Riggs was raped.
327	00:23:00	00:23:02	We found semen on her mattress.
328	00:23:02	00:23:06	We matched the seminal DNA to you.
329	00:23:06	00:23:07	Q-tip down my throat.
330	00:23:07	00:23:10	Thought you were here trying to find out what happened to Paige.
331	00:23:10	00:23:12	We are.
332	00:23:12	00:23:14	So what did happen, Kevin?
333	00:23:14	00:23:15	You attack Paige, too?
334	00:23:15	00:23:20	Hell, you been in her room before but unlike her roommate Paige fought back, is that it?
335	00:23:20	00:23:22	I never touched Paige.
336	00:23:22	00:23:24	I wasn't even in town.
337	00:23:24	00:23:25	Three ball games in Fresno.
338	00:23:25	00:23:27	We got back yesterday.
339	00:23:27	00:23:28	Check the roster.
340	00:23:28	00:23:30	Ask Coach.
341	00:23:30	00:23:32	No, I'll do that but in the meantime, you're coming with us.
342	00:23:33	00:23:37	You're under arrest for the use of a controlled substance in the sexual assault on Jennifer Riggs.
343	00:23:37	00:23:38	Get him out of here.
344	00:23:38	00:23:40	Wait for me.
345	00:23:40	00:23:43	Wait for me in the car.
346	00:23:47	00:23:49	Another dead end.
347	00:23:49	00:23:50	Yeah, I know, I talked to the coach.
348	00:23:50	00:23:52	Road trip.
349	00:23:52	00:23:54	We're losing her.
350	00:23:58	00:23:59	And there it is again.
351	00:24:01	00:24:11	You know, that car circled the block six times 20 and 8 All right, you loop around twice you're looking for a parking space.
352	00:24:11	00:24:13	Six times...
353	00:24:13	00:24:15	You're up to no good.
354	00:24:15	00:24:18	Is that something hanging from the rearview mirror?
355	00:24:20	00:24:23	Why don't you zoom in on that.
356	00:24:35	00:24:39	You know, it's easier to get a master's degree than a parking spot on campus.
357	00:24:39	00:24:44	Right. Why don't you meet up with University Parking and cross-reference all silver Volvos.
358	00:24:45	00:24:46	Right.
359	00:24:46	00:24:47	Oh, and Nick?
360	00:24:47	00:24:48	Yeah?
361	00:24:49	00:24:50	When you find the car...
362	00:24:50	00:24:52	I know-- check the trunk.
363	00:24:56	00:25:01	Silver Volvo. University I.D.
364	00:25:01	00:25:05	A world of possibilities reduced to a single car?
365	00:25:05	00:25:09	Registered to Robert Woodbury, philosophy professor, tenured.
366	00:25:09	00:25:11	Detail's almost got the latch.
367	00:25:34	00:25:37	Nick, tow it to CSI and process.
368	00:25:37	00:25:39	Cath...
369	00:25:39	00:25:41	Office hours with the professor.
370	00:25:41	00:25:43	Yes...
371	00:25:43	00:25:45	I was near the dorm that night.
372	00:25:45	00:25:51	Professor Woodbury, you circled the block six times.
373	00:25:51	00:25:53	Let's start with an easy question.
374	00:25:54	00:25:56	Paige Rycoff was a student of yours.
375	00:25:56	00:25:58	Introduction to Philosophy, yes.
376	00:25:58	00:26:00	Amanda...
377	00:26:00	00:26:02	uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow after class.
378	00:26:05	00:26:07	Cute.
379	00:26:07	00:26:10	Let me guess-- C student?
380	00:26:10	00:26:12	Not if I can help it.
381	00:26:14	00:26:16	and what kind of student was Paige?
382	00:26:17	00:26:20	She was a very bright young woman.
383	00:26:22	00:26:27	Some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout in the milk.
384	00:26:29	00:26:30	Henry David Thoreau.
385	00:26:30	00:26:33	But that's just broken pottery.
386	00:26:33	00:26:39	My perception-- sign of struggle.
387	00:26:41	00:26:43	Okay, look, it's been six days.
388	00:26:43	00:26:47	If you have a legitimate reason for being outside of her dorm, tell us.
389	00:26:47	00:26:50	If you have an illegitimate reason, tell us that.
390	00:26:50	00:26:52	Tell us something, so that we can move forward.
391	00:26:56	00:27:00	Again, my perception-- silence confirms guilt.
392	00:27:02	00:27:06	We found you. We will find what you're hiding.
393	00:27:06	00:27:08	I'm married.
394	00:27:08	00:27:10	Yep. The ring indicates that.
395	00:27:10	00:27:11	Your car's on the way to the crime lab.
396	00:27:11	00:27:13	We're going to need to search your home.
397	00:27:13	00:27:15	She was never in my car; she was never in my house.
398	00:27:15	00:27:16	Where has she been?
399	00:27:16	00:27:20	Here. That's how the vase broke, because we were...
400	00:27:20	00:27:21	Physical.
401	00:27:21	00:27:23	Amorous.
402	00:27:23	00:27:25	Oh, so you cared about her?
403	00:27:25	00:27:27	But obviously not enough to come forward.
404	00:27:27	00:27:35	And tell you what? That I cheat on my wife with my student who is missing and I have absolutely no information?
405	00:27:35	00:27:40	If it was important enough for you to hide it's important enough for us to know.
406	00:27:42	00:27:44	Any idea where she might be? No. I...
407	00:27:44	00:27:46	I went to the dorm.
408	00:27:46	00:27:53	I-I did. I went to, I don't know, maybe to stop her maybe to say good-bye one last time but at the very least, I wanted to see her.
409	00:27:54	00:27:56	But she never came down.
410	00:27:57	00:27:59	Let's take a ride in the black-and-white.
411	00:28:01	00:28:04	Can I meet you there?
412	00:28:04	00:28:05	I-I'm not going anywhere.
413	00:28:05	00:28:10	I just need a little time to explain all this to my wife.
414	00:28:11	00:28:13	No, I understand.
415	00:28:13	00:28:14	I'll send an officer with you, just in case.
416	00:28:15	00:28:17	Thank you.
417	00:28:42	00:28:47	Medulla, cuticle and cortex are a visual match to the hairs I pulled from Paige Rycoff's brush.
418	00:28:47	00:28:51	The roots have skin tags.
419	00:28:51	00:28:53	Means hairs were ripped out.
420	00:28:53	00:28:55	Ouch!
421	00:28:56	00:28:59	Too bad this doesn't get us any closer to finding Paige.
422	00:28:59	00:29:01	She was in his car.
423	00:29:01	00:29:04	It gets us closer to our suspect.
424	00:29:05	00:29:09	Let me remind you, you have the right to counsel.
425	00:29:09	00:29:10	I don't need counsel.
426	00:29:11	00:29:12	The only person I was hiding from was my wife.
427	00:29:12	00:29:14	She knows everything now.
428	00:29:14	00:29:16	So ask your questions.
429	00:29:18	00:29:22	We found some of Paige's hair in your car.
430	00:29:22	00:29:24	Well, that's impossible because she's never been in my car.
431	00:29:24	00:29:26	Are you sure it was hers?
432	00:29:26	00:29:29	You mean, uh, will it stand up in court?
433	00:29:29	00:29:30	Yes, it will.
434	00:29:30	00:29:32	Well, maybe it was on my sweater or something.
435	00:29:33	00:29:38	Four strands of hair pulled out by the root, on the passenger's headrest.
436	00:29:42	00:29:44	How about this one?
437	00:29:44	00:29:48	A phone call made from your house to Paige's dorm room the day she disappeared.
438	00:29:48	00:29:53	I only use my cell phone when I call her-- not my office, not my home.
439	00:29:53	00:29:58	16 p.m., four minutes long.
440	00:30:01	00:30:08	Faculty lunch 00 to 2 And it will stand up in court.
441	00:30:10	00:30:14	Professor Woodbury, does your wife work?
442	00:30:14	00:30:15	No.
443	00:30:17	00:30:20	No.
444	00:30:23	00:30:26	So, are you home during the day?
445	00:30:26	00:30:30	00 on the day that Paige Rycoff disappeared?
446	00:30:30	00:30:32	I don't remember.
447	00:30:32	00:30:36	Sharon, someone called Paige from the house, and it wasn't me.
448	00:30:36	00:30:40	Mrs. Woodbury do you have the keys to your husband's car?
449	00:30:40	00:30:43	We share it. It's our car.
450	00:30:43	00:30:45	How long have you known?
451	00:30:45	00:30:47	About this one or all the others?
452	00:30:47	00:30:49	I knew that she was different.
453	00:30:49	00:31:01	And I wasn't about to let some kid walk away with my marriage so I called her up, took her for a ride explained the facts of life to her-- wife, three kids mortgage.
454	00:31:01	00:31:04	She said it was over, she was going home.
455	00:31:04	00:31:07	Didn't say why; I didn't ask.
456	00:31:07	00:31:11	Mrs. Woodbury, I think you're leaving something out.
457	00:31:11	00:31:17	They found Paige's hair in the car and they think...
458	00:31:19	00:31:21	Did you attack her?
459	00:31:21	00:31:23	No.
460	00:31:23	00:31:25	I wanted to.
461	00:31:25	00:31:27	I almost did.
462	00:31:27	00:31:29	She went to get out of the car.
463	00:31:29	00:31:32	You are 18. What the hell do you know about love?
464	00:31:32	00:31:34	I don't need to take this.
465	00:31:34	00:31:36	Ow!
466	00:31:37	00:31:39	I stopped her.
467	00:31:40	00:31:43	Apologized. We talked.
468	00:31:43	00:31:45	And I dropped her off.
469	00:31:46	00:31:48	Excuse me. Yeah.
470	00:31:49	00:31:51	Grissom.
471	00:31:56	00:31:58	So, is it her?
472	00:31:58	00:32:00	I don't know. I just got here myself.
473	00:32:00	00:32:04	Some homeless guy searching for hidden treasure finds a body.
474	00:32:04	00:32:06	P.D.'s here on the scene.
475	00:32:06	00:32:08	We got first looks.
476	00:32:37	00:32:39	Yeah.
477	00:32:41	00:32:42	I've seen things like this before.
478	00:32:43	00:32:51	When I worked in Arlington, Virginia, every winter homeless trying to stay warm take a nap in a Dumpster wake up in a garbage compactor. Mulch.
479	00:32:51	00:32:54	Warrick and I searched the trash chute at the dorm.
480	00:32:54	00:32:57	It was clean. There was no reason to check the Dumpster.
481	00:32:57	00:33:02	So you're saying she was killed by the compactor. Crushed to death.
482	00:33:02	00:33:03	No, she was crushed postmortem.
483	00:33:03	00:33:05	And you know this how?
484	00:33:05	00:33:11	Tissue in the extremities was yellow and dry.
485	00:33:11	00:33:17	Means blood wasn't pumping through her veins when she went through that compactor.
486	00:33:17	00:33:18	So what did kill her?
487	00:33:19	00:33:22	Massive internal bleeding. Her spleen ruptured.
488	00:33:22	00:33:23	From what?
489	00:33:23	00:33:25	Blunt-force trauma.
490	00:33:25	00:33:27	Point of impact?
491	00:33:27	00:33:28	Rib cage.
492	00:33:28	00:33:32	Ribs weren't crushed. They sustained a single blow.
493	00:33:34	00:33:35	Type of weapon?
494	00:33:35	00:33:36	I have no idea.
495	00:33:36	00:33:38	I'm still trying to straighten her out.
496	00:33:38	00:33:39	Truth? I may never know.
497	00:33:39	00:33:42	Now what?
498	00:33:42	00:33:45	Well, you followed the lead, it went cold.
499	00:33:45	00:33:46	Now it's hot again.
500	00:33:56	00:33:59	I found some blood.
501	00:34:03	00:34:04	Yeah.
502	00:34:04	00:34:06	Not much, but enough to work with.
503	00:34:06	00:34:07	Okay.
504	00:34:07	00:34:09	Photograph it, swab it.
505	00:34:09	00:34:10	Let's get it back to the lab.
506	00:34:10	00:34:13	If it's hers, maybe that's why the scent dogs lost their trail.
507	00:34:13	00:34:15	The odor from the Dumpster would've...
508	00:34:15	00:34:16	thrown them off.
509	00:34:17	00:34:18	I think I got something here. Check this out.
510	00:34:18	00:34:20	The whole Dumpster's beat to hell.
511	00:34:20	00:34:22	This one spot's fresh.
512	00:34:27	00:34:31	Nick's right-- the vehicle paint chips metal flecks in the color coat.
513	00:34:31	00:34:33	There's some matching chips on the ground.
514	00:34:33	00:34:38	Still, there's no reason to think there's a connection between the paint transfer and Paige.
515	00:34:38	00:34:40	No reason to think there's not.
516	00:34:40	00:34:42	Possibly a hit-and-run?
517	00:34:42	00:34:45	Means the vehicle had a high ground clearance. Maybe an SUV?
518	00:34:45	00:34:48	It would explain the blunt-force trauma.
519	00:34:49	00:34:52	Point of impact was her abdomen.
520	00:35:00	00:35:03	Driver tossed her in the Dumpster to hide his crime.
521	00:35:03	00:35:05	Or her crime.
522	00:35:05	00:35:07	Mrs. Woodbury.
523	00:35:07	00:35:09	She's still a viable suspect.
524	00:35:09	00:35:10	But with a silver car.
525	00:35:10	00:35:14	She could have rented borrowed from a friend.
526	00:35:14	00:35:15	Still, why was Paige even down here?
527	00:35:16	00:35:19	Look, let's stick to the how-- we'll deal with the why later.
528	00:35:21	00:35:26	The car that impacted the Dumpster was originally white then painted red, and now it's black.
529	00:35:26	00:35:29	There's two coats of primer between each paint job.
530	00:35:29	00:35:31	Quality work-- probably a dealership.
531	00:35:31	00:35:34	Every paint has a unique light absorption rate.
532	00:35:34	00:35:36	We I.D. the paint, we get to the car.
533	00:35:36	00:35:38	Really?
534	00:35:40	00:35:42	Cherokee, '89 or '90.
535	00:35:42	00:35:45	Three paint jobs, all factory stock.
536	00:35:45	00:35:50	Stone white, flame red and there's your midnight black there.
537	00:35:50	00:35:52	Well, this narrows our scope.
538	00:35:52	00:35:53	Call Brass.
539	00:35:53	00:35:54	Done.
540	00:35:54	00:35:56	An hour ago.
541	00:36:00	00:36:01	Where you been?
542	00:36:01	00:36:05	I can't be everywhere, Warrick and they banned human cloning.
543	00:36:05	00:36:06	I just left Sanders.
544	00:36:06	00:36:10	The blood from the Dumpster matches Paige.
545	00:36:10	00:36:12	Hey. Brass just called. He's down at P.D.
546	00:36:12	00:36:14	Paint to car; car to driver.
547	00:36:14	00:36:17	Suspect's down there-- he's looking for you.
548	00:36:24	00:36:25	Expectant father.
549	00:36:25	00:36:29	My wife's pregnant. Almost nine months.
550	00:36:29	00:36:31	She beeped me.
551	00:36:31	00:36:32	I was trying to get home.
552	00:36:33	00:36:34	Couldn't believe the traffic.
553	00:36:35	00:36:36	You always drive through campus?
554	00:36:37	00:36:39	We live on the other side of Fraternity Row.
555	00:36:39	00:36:44	It's a straight shot from my office but I get to the freshman dorm, nothing's moving.
556	00:36:44	00:36:46	What time is this?
557	00:36:46	00:36:47	30, I guess.
558	00:36:49	00:36:53	So you took a shortcut?
559	00:36:53	00:36:56	Yeah, I thought I was having a baby so I gunned it down the alley.
560	00:36:56	00:36:58	Then what happened?
561	00:36:58	00:37:01	I veered to avoid the parked van.
562	00:37:01	00:37:05	It was wet... and I swiped the Dumpster.
563	00:37:11	00:37:14	If I had hit a car, I would've stopped.
564	00:37:14	00:37:17	It... it was just a Dumpster.
565	00:37:17	00:37:21	Paint transfer's green, just like the Dumpster.
566	00:37:21	00:37:24	Doesn't mean he didn't also hit a body.
567	00:37:24	00:37:30	We have sprayed, U.V.'d-- no hair, no fibers, no blood anywhere.
568	00:37:30	00:37:33	It was a clean strike against the Dumpster.
569	00:37:36	00:37:39	Your guy didn't hit Paige.
570	00:37:39	00:37:42	And we've chased another lead to a dead end.
571	00:37:42	00:37:44	We still have Mrs. Woodbury.
572	00:37:44	00:37:45	Or her husband.
573	00:37:46	00:37:47	Oh, we've got tons of motives.
574	00:37:47	00:37:50	Not a stitch of evidence.
575	00:37:51	00:37:58	H.L. Mencken once said There's an easy solution to every human problem-- neat, plausible... and wrong.
576	00:37:58	00:38:10	So if the solution to our problem is not neat plausible and wrong then it could be messy, unlikely and right.
577	00:38:10	00:38:12	Right?
578	00:38:13	00:38:17	A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil we get a hurricane off the coast of Florida.
579	00:38:17	00:38:19	Chaos theory. Here we go.
580	00:38:19	00:38:23	Random events; the wholesale rejection of linear thought.
581	00:38:23	00:38:25	Physics meets philosophy.
582	00:38:25	00:38:33	If we apply it to Paige Rycoff and our case at this particular moment in time then we can say life is unpredictable.
583	00:38:33	00:38:37	No one can predict more than a few seconds into the future.
584	00:38:37	00:38:39	I predict I'll still be standing here one minute from now.
585	00:38:40	00:38:41	Where are we going with this?
586	00:38:41	00:38:44	Paige was in her dorm room and then ended up in the Dumpster.
587	00:38:44	00:38:47	Somewhere between her dorm room and the Dumpster is our answer.
588	00:38:47	00:38:48	That's where we're going.
589	00:38:48	00:38:50	Coming, Nick?
590	00:38:51	00:38:54	Nice try, Nostradamus.
591	00:38:57	00:38:59	Look out the window.
592	00:39:02	00:39:04	What do you see?
593	00:39:07	00:39:11	Traffic. My cab is waiting for me.
594	00:39:11	00:39:13	So what do you do next?
595	00:39:13	00:39:14	Grab my suitcases...
596	00:39:14	00:39:16	get out of town.
597	00:39:17	00:39:18	Stop.
598	00:39:19	00:39:20	Suitcases never left the room.
599	00:39:20	00:39:22	You didn't take them with.
600	00:39:24	00:39:26	I've been cleaning all day.
601	00:39:26	00:39:28	Because you want your security deposit back.
602	00:39:28	00:39:31	Yeah, I have to leave the room exactly like I found it.
603	00:39:33	00:39:36	So what's missing?
604	00:39:36	00:39:44	Two box springs, two mattresses two desks... two lamps, two chairs two dressers.
605	00:39:45	00:39:47	Trash can?
606	00:39:50	00:39:52	And it's missing.
607	00:39:52	00:39:55	What's the last thing you do after you've done the cleaning?
608	00:39:55	00:39:57	Take out the trash.
609	00:40:02	00:40:05	Hi. Could I borrow your trash can?
610	00:40:05	00:40:09	Paige dumps the trash, goes back to her room.
611	00:40:09	00:40:12	How does she end up in the Dumpster?
612	00:40:12	00:40:13	You're thinking too linear.
613	00:40:13	00:40:16	Chaos theory, remember? Just dump it.
614	00:40:16	00:40:18	Okay.
615	00:40:23	00:40:24	Whoa.
616	00:40:24	00:40:26	Almost took my hand off.
617	00:40:26	00:40:28	Maybe you're quicker than Paige was.
618	00:40:30	00:40:31	Excuse me.
619	00:40:31	00:40:33	Could you do me a favor?
620	00:40:33	00:40:34	We're doing a little experiment.
621	00:40:34	00:40:38	Could you count to a hundred and then drop this can all the way down the chute?
622	00:40:38	00:40:40	Thanks.
623	00:40:40	00:40:42	Watch your fingers.
624	00:40:49	00:40:52	What the hell is going on?
625	00:40:52	00:40:54	There was a busted spring in the chute.
626	00:40:55	00:41:00	Oh, yeah, I had to prop that open when Catherine rappelled down.
627	00:41:00	00:41:02	Relevance?
628	00:41:02	00:41:05	The trash can was missing from Paige's room.
629	00:41:05	00:41:08	You're thinking she accidentally dropped it down the chute.
630	00:41:08	00:41:10	Then how did she end up in the Dumpster?
631	00:41:10	00:41:13	She wanted her security deposit back.
632	00:41:13	00:41:16	And there's no easy access here.
633	00:41:16	00:41:19	Right, so... she had to improvise.
634	00:41:21	00:41:24	Excuse me. Oh. Please.
635	00:41:26	00:41:28	This actually happened to me once before, with a set of keys.
636	00:41:29	00:41:31	Eddie and I had this huge blowout.
637	00:41:31	00:41:33	He threw my keys in the trash.
638	00:41:33	00:41:38	All right, so Paige... leans over reaches for the trash can.
639	00:41:38	00:41:42	But just then, here comes Mark Doyle.
640	00:42:15	00:42:16	Let me get this straight.
641	00:42:16	00:42:23	You're-you're saying a confluence of unrelated, unfortunate events conspired... to kill my daughter.
642	00:42:24	00:42:25	Yes.
643	00:42:25	00:42:26	No, no, no.
644	00:42:26	00:42:28	Somebody is responsible.
645	00:42:28	00:42:33	Mrs. Rycoff there is no one guilty of this.
646	00:42:33	00:42:36	Because you say so?
647	00:42:36	00:42:38	Because the evidence says so.
648	00:42:38	00:42:41	We'll hire an investigator, as many as necessary.
649	00:42:41	00:42:46	Someone killed Paige and my wife and I won't rest until every question is answered.
650	00:42:50	00:42:52	We told them what happened.
651	00:42:52	00:42:56	Yeah, but we didn't give them what they needed-- some closure.
652	00:42:58	00:43:01	Truth brings closure.
653	00:43:02	00:43:05	Not always.
