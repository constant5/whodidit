0,00:00:41,00:00:42,Help!
1,00:00:42,00:00:44,"I need help! Ma'am, you all right?"
2,00:00:44,00:00:45,There's a baby inside the car!
3,00:00:45,00:00:48,Where are your keys? It's not my car.
4,00:00:48,00:00:49,Help!
5,00:00:49,00:00:50,Somebody help us! Get back!
6,00:00:50,00:00:51,Get back! Help!
7,00:01:00,00:01:03,(inaudible radio transmissions)
8,00:01:12,00:01:14,Registration's not here.
9,00:01:14,00:01:17,Shopping plaza.
10,00:01:17,00:01:20,Mother can't be too far.
11,00:01:23,00:01:27,When are parents going to learn a car is not a baby-sitter?
12,00:01:28,00:01:31,108 degrees outside.
13,00:01:31,00:01:35,You want to document the inside temperature?
14,00:01:39,00:01:42,How many of these have we had this year?
15,00:01:42,00:01:45,I lost count after ten.
16,00:01:45,00:01:46,This one makes 12.
17,00:01:47,00:01:48,"MAN: Hey, that's my car."
18,00:01:48,00:01:50,"Look, what the hell is going on?"
19,00:01:50,00:01:52,"Hey, that's my car."
20,00:01:52,00:01:53,What are they doing?
21,00:01:53,00:01:56,Did somebody break in to my car?
22,00:01:56,00:01:58,"I'm Detective Brass, Las Vegas Police."
23,00:01:58,00:01:59,"Sir, do you have a son?"
24,00:02:00,00:02:03,"Oh, God! Joshua!"
25,00:02:07,00:02:12,145 degreesinsidethe car.
26,00:02:55,00:02:57,DEEJAY:There's a heat advisory in effect.
27,00:02:57,00:02:59,"Young ones and old ones, say INSIDE."
28,00:03:00,00:03:03,"Make sure you wear a hat, and drink plenty of liquids..."
29,00:03:04,00:03:08,"If it's not babies in cars, it's babies in swimming pools."
30,00:03:09,00:03:11,That time of year.
31,00:03:11,00:03:20,"MAN: Body's fully rigid-- normally I'd say infant's been dead a couple of hours, but in this weather, it's possible the infant died no more than an hour ago."
32,00:03:22,00:03:23,"I'm off for air, Catherine."
33,00:03:25,00:03:27,I brought a sheet.
34,00:03:27,00:03:32,"All these lookie-loos, I think we'd better treat this like the baby's still alive."
35,00:03:51,00:03:52,(softly): Thanks.
36,00:04:08,00:04:10,(engine starts)
37,00:04:23,00:04:27,MAN: I spotted her from my boat during a routine patrol.
38,00:04:27,00:04:29,Boot prints and drag marks.
39,00:04:29,00:04:31,Did you move her? Had to.
40,00:04:31,00:04:33,Didn't want her floating away.
41,00:04:37,00:04:40,"STOKES: Board shorts, aqua sock shoes."
42,00:04:40,00:04:41,Dressed for sport.
43,00:04:41,00:04:43,No sign of bloating.
44,00:04:43,00:04:45,Chances are she's been dead less than 24 hours.
45,00:04:45,00:04:51,"Neck looks broken, her head's split, but there's no cone of foam."
46,00:04:51,00:04:53,No what?
47,00:04:53,00:04:57,"Uh, we have air in our lungs-- add water, you get foam."
48,00:04:57,00:04:58,It means she didn't drown.
49,00:04:58,00:05:01,"Well, apparently, it's not the only way to die out here."
50,00:05:08,00:05:13,(over speaker): I was supposed to drop Joshua off at daycare.
51,00:05:14,00:05:17,My wife usually brings him on her way to work.
52,00:05:21,00:05:23,It was a hectic morning.
53,00:05:23,00:05:26,My cell phone was going off.
54,00:05:26,00:05:28,Problems at the office.
55,00:05:28,00:05:31,"Look, I don't care how much pressure we get from the financier."
56,00:05:31,00:05:33,"Look... Oh, can you hold on a second?"
57,00:05:33,00:05:34,I have anoth...
58,00:05:34,00:05:36,"I'm sorry, I can't do this right now."
59,00:05:36,00:05:39,"I'm driving. Look, hold all the calls, call my wife, tell her I'll be..."
60,00:05:39,00:05:40,I'll be home late.
61,00:05:40,00:05:42,I forgot he was in the back seat.
62,00:05:42,00:05:44,How could you forget?
63,00:05:44,00:05:45,I'm not the one who drives him.
64,00:05:45,00:05:47,Vickie does that.
65,00:05:49,00:05:51,I was distracted.
66,00:05:51,00:05:53,My-my job consumes so much of my mind...
67,00:05:53,00:05:55,"So, what kind of job you have that's so distracting?"
68,00:05:55,00:05:59,I'm an agent for the gaming commission.
69,00:05:59,00:06:02,"It's a 25-hour-a-day job, eight days a week."
70,00:06:02,00:06:03,Your wife work?
71,00:06:04,00:06:06,She works as much as me.
72,00:06:10,00:06:12,Joshua made it all worthwhile.
73,00:06:12,00:06:14,BRASS: Where's your wife now?
74,00:06:14,00:06:17,She's in L.A. on business.
75,00:06:20,00:06:22,What am I going to tell her?
76,00:06:38,00:06:41,We needsomething.
77,00:06:46,00:06:50,"No birthmark, no scars, no tattoos."
78,00:07:01,00:07:03,It's a locker key.
79,00:07:04,00:07:06,"You put in for the promotion, huh?"
80,00:07:06,00:07:08,"Yeah. Yeah, last week."
81,00:07:08,00:07:09,I still haven't heard anything about it.
82,00:07:10,00:07:11,"Yeah, neither have I."
83,00:07:11,00:07:13,"MAN: Hey, you ready for me?"
84,00:07:13,00:07:15,She's all yours.
85,00:07:15,00:07:18,Heard you had a rough morning.
86,00:07:18,00:07:20,I've had better.
87,00:07:38,00:07:41,"Sara, take a look at this."
88,00:07:41,00:07:44,What is that?
89,00:07:45,00:07:46,I don't know.
90,00:07:50,00:07:53,You were right about your dead swimmer.
91,00:07:53,00:07:54,She didn't drown.
92,00:07:54,00:07:59,Cause of death was a palpable fracture of the neck at C1/C2. SIDLE: From the blow to the head.
93,00:07:59,00:08:00,Probably.
94,00:08:00,00:08:02,Cerebral contusion's beneath the skull fracture.
95,00:08:02,00:08:03,Savage hit.
96,00:08:04,00:08:05,Greg processed the sexual assault kit.
97,00:08:06,00:08:07,Positive for semen.
98,00:08:07,00:08:09,There were no physical findings for rape.
99,00:08:09,00:08:10,Not a lot to go on here.
100,00:08:10,00:08:16,"Gastric lumen contained dark, pasty material-- maybe slightly digested meat, stringy vegetable matter."
101,00:08:16,00:08:17,Does it give us a timeline?
102,00:08:17,00:08:23,"Emptying rates vary from person to person, but I'd estimate she ate two to four hours before death."
103,00:08:23,00:08:24,"All right, good."
104,00:08:24,00:08:27,Ranger Stone came through-- found our locker.
105,00:08:29,00:08:31,"Ms. Willows, uh, Chief Deputy D.A."
106,00:08:31,00:08:33,Jeffrey Sinclair. Mm-hmm.
107,00:08:33,00:08:35,Personal visit-- must be important. It is.
108,00:08:35,00:08:38,"Joshua Winston, the dead infant? We're working on it."
109,00:08:38,00:08:40,How long was the baby left inside the car?
110,00:08:40,00:08:44,"Based on the time of death, we estimate roughly an hour."
111,00:08:44,00:08:46,The 9-1-1 call came in at 11:30 in the morning.
112,00:08:46,00:08:51,"Okay, and what time does Paul Winston start work?"
113,00:08:51,00:08:53,"According to Captain Brass, uh, 10:00 a.m."
114,00:08:53,00:08:55,(scoffs): Hour and a half.
115,00:08:55,00:09:03,"Come on, look, I've got a three-year-old at home, and I've left him inside a covered garage with groceries for two minutes, tops, but two hours, in this heat?"
116,00:09:03,00:09:04,I know. It's a tragedy.
117,00:09:05,00:09:08,"You know, cases like these almost never see the inside of a courtroom."
118,00:09:08,00:09:10,This one will.
119,00:09:10,00:09:12,Is there any worse punishment than losing your child?
120,00:09:12,00:09:14,Yeah. Jail time.
121,00:09:15,00:09:21,"I want him behind bars, so the next time a parent steps away from their vehicle in triple-degree heat, they check the back seat before they lock the door."
122,00:09:21,00:09:24,Doesn't change my job.
123,00:09:24,00:09:29,Look... I-I need you guys to thoroughly document this case.
124,00:09:29,00:09:36,"I don't want any more surprises in court, so from the car to the kid, just try to cross your T's and dot your I's, okay?"
125,00:09:36,00:09:40,I always do.
126,00:09:41,00:09:43,WILLOWS: Car seat's fastened correctly.
127,00:09:43,00:09:45,Most aren't.
128,00:09:53,00:09:55,"Hey, Gil."
129,00:09:55,00:09:58,Look at this. What do you see?
130,00:09:58,00:09:59,Um...
131,00:10:01,00:10:02,Nothing.
132,00:10:02,00:10:03,Exactly.
133,00:10:03,00:10:05,There's no indentations in the leather.
134,00:10:05,00:10:08,"Well, maybe this wasn't the primary vehicle for transporting the baby."
135,00:10:09,00:10:09,Yeah.
136,00:10:10,00:10:11,Same thing the father said.
137,00:10:11,00:10:13,What is that?
138,00:10:14,00:10:16,Oh.
139,00:10:30,00:10:33,Negative for blood.
140,00:10:33,00:10:35,(sighs)
141,00:10:35,00:10:37,What are you thinking?
142,00:10:37,00:10:41,I don't get people.
143,00:10:46,00:10:48,...reporting a record number of heat-stroke victims.
144,00:10:48,00:10:50,Please be advised to drink plenty of fluids...
145,00:10:50,00:10:52,(camera shutter clicking)
146,00:10:54,00:10:56,You with me?
147,00:10:56,00:10:58,I am now.
148,00:10:58,00:11:01,Catherine's doing the baby case.
149,00:11:02,00:11:04,It's hot in here.
150,00:11:04,00:11:05,"Hell, yeah."
151,00:11:08,00:11:10,Super came in to the check the A.C.
152,00:11:10,00:11:11,and he found him like this.
153,00:11:11,00:11:14,Wesley Jones. 33.
154,00:11:14,00:11:15,In his massage chair.
155,00:11:15,00:11:19,No signs of forced entry.
156,00:11:19,00:11:22,It doesn't appear that robbery was a motive.
157,00:11:25,00:11:31,"A small bruise on his fingertip, but no outward signs of trauma."
158,00:11:31,00:11:34,I had a case once where a soda can was the murder weapon.
159,00:11:34,00:11:38,Suspect used it to bash in the victim's head.
160,00:11:45,00:11:49,"Diet shake, fitness magazine, cookie crumbs on the baking sheet."
161,00:11:49,00:11:53,This guy trying to start a diet or falling off of one.
162,00:11:53,00:11:54,He's got a workout schedule.
163,00:11:54,00:11:56,And today...
164,00:11:57,00:11:58,a three-mile run.
165,00:11:58,00:11:59,Whew.
166,00:12:02,00:12:06,"Fat metabolizers, containing ephedra."
167,00:12:06,00:12:10,Scorching heat and ephedra-- that's not good.
168,00:12:19,00:12:21,(grunts)
169,00:12:21,00:12:23,(panting)
170,00:12:25,00:12:26,Sounds like a heat stroke to me.
171,00:12:27,00:12:29,Yeah. Feel the burn.
172,00:12:32,00:12:34,"Hey, Greg. Hey."
173,00:12:34,00:12:35,How we doing on that swab?
174,00:12:35,00:12:37,It should be ready any minute.
175,00:12:37,00:12:38,Another baby.
176,00:12:38,00:12:41,Hear the D.A.'s really gunning for the father.
177,00:12:41,00:12:43,What do you think they're going to charge him with? Murder?
178,00:12:43,00:12:48,"Not likely. Child endangerment, child... neglect, child abuse."
179,00:12:48,00:12:50,Sounds like a slap on the wrist to me.
180,00:12:50,00:12:53,You and the D.A. can shake hands.
181,00:12:53,00:12:54,(printer humming)
182,00:12:54,00:12:57,Your printout's ready.
183,00:13:00,00:13:02,The red stain in the car...
184,00:13:02,00:13:04,Brompheniramine maleates.
185,00:13:04,00:13:05,USP-one.
186,00:13:05,00:13:08,Cough syrup.
187,00:13:17,00:13:19,(coins rattle)
188,00:13:19,00:13:20,Dollar slots?
189,00:13:21,00:13:25,Is there truly no place left in Las Vegas without slot machines?
190,00:13:29,00:13:32,University student I.D. Sophia Renatta.
191,00:13:32,00:13:34,20 years old.
192,00:13:34,00:13:36,SIDLE: A guy's wallet?
193,00:13:36,00:13:40,No credit card. No driver's license.
194,00:13:41,00:13:43,"Well, this is too big for Sophia."
195,00:13:43,00:13:44,It's a double extra large.
196,00:13:44,00:13:46,"Well, that's definitely a guy's."
197,00:13:46,00:13:48,Cold be a boyfriend or beach buddy.
198,00:13:48,00:13:50,Suspect?
199,00:13:50,00:13:51,Yeah. I remember her...
200,00:13:51,00:13:54,and her punk in shinning armor.
201,00:13:54,00:13:55,He wasn't a cool guy?
202,00:13:55,00:13:57,"The dude stiffed me, twice, bro."
203,00:13:57,00:14:00,"Rents my Waverunner, doesn't bring it back."
204,00:14:00,00:14:03,And his cheap-ass plastic's got a 2-K limit.
205,00:14:03,00:14:05,I'm out five grand. SIDLE: Ouch.
206,00:14:05,00:14:06,Did they look like a couple to you?
207,00:14:06,00:14:08,She was a pretty girl with a problem.
208,00:14:08,00:14:10,"He knew an ""in"" when he saw one."
209,00:14:10,00:14:11,You got a credit card?
210,00:14:11,00:14:13,"No, this is all I have."
211,00:14:13,00:14:14,"No, why don't you ask dad. We got a line here."
212,00:14:14,00:14:15,Why don't you step aside.
213,00:14:15,00:14:17,"Maybe, maybe I can help."
214,00:14:21,00:14:23,So you think they just met?
215,00:14:23,00:14:24,It's a hot day...
216,00:14:24,00:14:25,something must've been in the air.
217,00:14:25,00:14:27,We'll need to look at your rental log if you don't mind.
218,00:14:27,00:14:29,Go crazy. Thanks.
219,00:14:29,00:14:31,Thanks.
220,00:14:33,00:14:34,Here it is. Mark Young.
221,00:14:35,00:14:37,Checked out the Waverunner 11:45.
222,00:14:37,00:14:40,But he and Sophia didn't hit the water until 2:15.
223,00:14:40,00:14:44,"Well, if he did just meet her, he's a pretty smooth operator."
224,00:14:44,00:14:48,"Bailed her out, bought her lunch, and still had some coins left over to play the slots."
225,00:14:48,00:14:50,Classic lake date.
226,00:14:54,00:14:56,Boy meets girl...
227,00:14:56,00:14:57,girl ends up dead.
228,00:15:02,00:15:04,Mrs. Winston?
229,00:15:04,00:15:06,I asked my husband to do one thing.
230,00:15:07,00:15:09,One thing.
231,00:15:09,00:15:11,I got up early.
232,00:15:11,00:15:14,I fed Joshua.
233,00:15:14,00:15:18,"I got him changed, dressed."
234,00:15:18,00:15:23,All he had to do was drop him off.
235,00:15:23,00:15:27,"WILLOWS: You flew to Los Angeles, Mrs. Winston?"
236,00:15:27,00:15:29,(sighs)
237,00:15:29,00:15:33,"I had, uh, business in Anaheim."
238,00:15:33,00:15:34,I'm in horticulture.
239,00:15:34,00:15:38,My company is designing a garden for a new hotel.
240,00:15:38,00:15:40,How'd you get to the airport?
241,00:15:40,00:15:43,I drove my car.
242,00:15:43,00:15:45,I'm assuming you have a baby seat in your vehicle.
243,00:15:45,00:15:48,Of course.
244,00:15:48,00:15:49,It's the law.
245,00:15:49,00:15:50,I...
246,00:15:50,00:15:53,I put it in Paul's car before I left.
247,00:15:57,00:16:00,"Mrs. Winston, did..."
248,00:16:00,00:16:02,Joshua have a cold?
249,00:16:02,00:16:05,He had a slight cough.
250,00:16:05,00:16:09,There was a bug going around daycare.
251,00:16:09,00:16:11,Did you give him anything for it?
252,00:16:11,00:16:13,Cough syrup.
253,00:16:13,00:16:14,Last night.
254,00:16:14,00:16:16,How about this morning?
255,00:16:20,00:16:24,There's a rule in our house that only one parent medicates the child.
256,00:16:24,00:16:30,But I told Paul to go ahead and give it to Joshua if he was still coughing.
257,00:16:32,00:16:34,Why?
258,00:16:35,00:16:37,Thanks for coming in. We're all done.
259,00:16:37,00:16:39,Thank you.
260,00:16:54,00:16:56,Vicky... What is wrong with you?!
261,00:16:56,00:16:58,How could you leave him in the car?!
262,00:16:58,00:17:00,What is wrong with you?!
263,00:17:00,00:17:02,(sobbing)
264,00:17:12,00:17:15,"Mr. Young, your son was last seen with a young girl."
265,00:17:15,00:17:16,We know that he rented a Waverunner.
266,00:17:16,00:17:20,Now that young girl is in our morgue and we don't know where your son is.
267,00:17:20,00:17:22,I can't believe this is happening.
268,00:17:22,00:17:24,Mark has a job.
269,00:17:24,00:17:28,There's no reason for him to be on the lake during a work day.
270,00:17:28,00:17:30,We contacted Mark's manager at work.
271,00:17:30,00:17:31,He called in sick.
272,00:17:31,00:17:32,What are you saying?
273,00:17:32,00:17:34,That he killed this girl? What is this?!
274,00:17:34,00:17:36,"No, no. No one's saying that."
275,00:17:37,00:17:37,We're just...
276,00:17:38,00:17:41,"Mr. Young, when is the last time that you saw Mark?"
277,00:17:41,00:17:42,Yesterday morning.
278,00:17:42,00:17:44,"He came by, got something to eat and he left."
279,00:17:44,00:17:46,"I mean, at this age, I can't keep track of him."
280,00:17:46,00:17:49,"Hey, believe me, I understand."
281,00:17:49,00:17:50,I've been there.
282,00:17:50,00:17:54,"Mr. Stokes, my son is not a criminal."
283,00:17:54,00:17:56,We're not saying he's a criminal.
284,00:17:56,00:18:00,All we're saying is your son had contact with the victim and now he's missing.
285,00:18:00,00:18:04,What we'd like to do is get a warrant to search your house.
286,00:18:04,00:18:05,A warrant?
287,00:18:05,00:18:06,But maybe we don't need one.
288,00:18:06,00:18:14,"If we could just come by there and collect some of Mark's things, uh, we could get a DNA sample, exclude him as a suspect."
289,00:18:14,00:18:17,You can take whatever you want.
290,00:18:17,00:18:20,Mark didn't hurt that girl.
291,00:18:27,00:18:29,"Go ahead, pinch him."
292,00:18:34,00:18:34,There's no tenting.
293,00:18:35,00:18:36,So he wasn't dehydrated.
294,00:18:36,00:18:37,"No, heat stroke."
295,00:18:37,00:18:40,Vitreous urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal.
296,00:18:40,00:18:41,Same for sodium.
297,00:18:41,00:18:42,What about drugs?
298,00:18:42,00:18:44,Tox was negative.
299,00:18:44,00:18:46,Heart attack?
300,00:18:46,00:18:48,"Organ was normal, under 400 grams."
301,00:18:48,00:18:50,Left ventricle less than 1.5 centimeters.
302,00:18:50,00:18:52,I've run out of questions.
303,00:18:52,00:18:55,"Well, I would've missed this one if it weren't for you."
304,00:18:56,00:18:59,"Oh, you sectioned off that fingertip bruise."
305,00:18:59,00:19:01,Look at the scope.
306,00:19:04,00:19:06,The skin cells look stressed out.
307,00:19:06,00:19:07,It's called nuclear streaming.
308,00:19:07,00:19:10,It occurs when an electric current passes through tissue.
309,00:19:10,00:19:12,He was electrocuted.
310,00:19:12,00:19:14,But how come there's no burn marks?
311,00:19:14,00:19:15,Low-power shock.
312,00:19:15,00:19:17,"Uh, current crossed the heart."
313,00:19:17,00:19:20,"No damage to the muscle, but havoc on the rhythm."
314,00:19:20,00:19:23,Ventricular fibrillation.
315,00:19:23,00:19:26,A precision clock becomes a bag of worms.
316,00:19:29,00:19:31,All it takes is a little current.
317,00:19:32,00:19:33,And a point of contact.
318,00:19:34,00:19:37,The substance on her hips is suntan lotion.
319,00:19:37,00:19:40,"Waterproof, zinc oxide, high SPF."
320,00:19:40,00:19:42,"Well, that's odd."
321,00:19:42,00:19:44,"The victim had a deep, even tan."
322,00:19:44,00:19:46,We collected low SPF oil from the locker.
323,00:19:46,00:19:49,It's a simple transfer-- him to her.
324,00:19:51,00:19:54,What about the green substance in the head wound?
325,00:19:54,00:19:55,Mm.
326,00:19:57,00:20:00,"Navicula, Hannaea, Achnanthes, Cymbella."
327,00:20:01,00:20:02,Algae.
328,00:20:02,00:20:04,"Yeah, not the free-swimming kind."
329,00:20:04,00:20:05,These are epilithic diatoms.
330,00:20:06,00:20:07,Attached to rocks.
331,00:20:07,00:20:08,Girl's out at the lake.
332,00:20:08,00:20:11,She meets some random guy she knows nothing about and she goes off with him.
333,00:20:11,00:20:12,She places herself in a bad situation.
334,00:20:13,00:20:14,WILLOWS: And bad things happen.
335,00:20:14,00:20:15,(screams)
336,00:20:18,00:20:22,Sophia takes a header off the Waverunner.
337,00:20:22,00:20:26,This algae grows everywhere.
338,00:20:26,00:20:28,A Waverunner... point and throttle.
339,00:20:28,00:20:30,(sighs)
340,00:20:30,00:20:31,We have no idea where they went.
341,00:20:31,00:20:35,Heard you guys narrowed your search area to 44 square miles.
342,00:20:35,00:20:37,That could take like months.
343,00:20:39,00:20:42,And I'm sure you're here to shed some light on the situation.
344,00:20:43,00:20:46,"Your case is a boy-girl thing, right?"
345,00:20:46,00:20:48,Right. Mm-hmm.
346,00:20:48,00:20:51,Body was washed up near Windmill Cove?
347,00:20:51,00:20:56,"These two coves to the north-- Cotton Wood Island, Tequila-- huge make-out spots."
348,00:20:56,00:20:58,But nearly impossible to get to by land.
349,00:20:58,00:21:01,"And how would you know that, Greg?"
350,00:21:01,00:21:03,A gentleman never tells.
351,00:21:03,00:21:05,"Anyway, I thought that would be a good place to start."
352,00:21:05,00:21:08,If you guys need an extra set of hands...
353,00:21:08,00:21:10,"Uh, no. No. I think we got it, boss."
354,00:22:18,00:22:30,"""Howard Aston Winston."" Reporting the record number of..."
355,00:22:30,00:22:32,still advises all citizens to stay hydrated and...
356,00:22:32,00:22:37,"I got the state medical records for Howard Ashton Winston-- born August 12, 2000."
357,00:22:37,00:22:38,Would've been three years old.
358,00:22:38,00:22:39,When did he die?
359,00:22:40,00:22:42,Last year-- Tay-Sachs Disease.
360,00:22:42,00:22:43,"Oh, that's incurable."
361,00:22:43,00:22:45,"Like MS, right?"
362,00:22:45,00:22:48,"Yeah, I worked with a cop in New Jersey whose son died from it."
363,00:22:48,00:22:50,"Aw, the poor kid went blind, couldn't swallow."
364,00:22:50,00:22:53,"In the end, he couldn't even lift his head up."
365,00:22:53,00:22:56,The Winstons never mentioned they had another child.
366,00:22:56,00:22:58,"Losing one kid is tough, but two?"
367,00:22:58,00:23:00,I know it.
368,00:23:02,00:23:05,These wires are all insulated.
369,00:23:05,00:23:07,No burn marks.
370,00:23:07,00:23:10,Current didn't pass through this chair.
371,00:23:10,00:23:11,Whoa-ho!
372,00:23:11,00:23:13,What you got?
373,00:23:13,00:23:15,Ultimate power.
374,00:23:15,00:23:18,I could program this bad boy to make me a cup of coffee.
375,00:23:18,00:23:21,Is there any sign of electrical surging?
376,00:23:21,00:23:25,"Well... this remote control's got plenty of juice, but..."
377,00:23:25,00:23:26,"the board's clean, no scoring."
378,00:23:27,00:23:32,"You know, if I had my choice about how I was going to go out, it would not be electrocution."
379,00:23:32,00:23:37,I think an aneurysm in my sleep-- quick and painless.
380,00:23:37,00:23:39,I like surprises.
381,00:23:44,00:23:45,Bingo.
382,00:23:45,00:23:46,Look at that.
383,00:23:47,00:23:51,Current went through the phone.
384,00:23:51,00:23:53,From what? Heat lightning.
385,00:23:53,00:23:57,"Storm rolls through the desert, sometimes it strikes in town."
386,00:24:00,00:24:03,(electrical current zapping)
387,00:24:08,00:24:11,(zapping continuing)
388,00:24:11,00:24:12,(groans)
389,00:24:12,00:24:14,Electrocution through the phone line?
390,00:24:14,00:24:16,I thought that was a myth.
391,00:24:16,00:24:17,This look like a myth to you?
392,00:24:26,00:24:28,"STOKES: Nice call, Greg."
393,00:24:28,00:24:30,There's our Waverunner.
394,00:24:41,00:24:43,Signs of sex; no sign of blood.
395,00:24:43,00:24:45,Half a tank of gas.
396,00:24:45,00:24:48,Why didn't he just take this to get out of Dodge?
397,00:24:48,00:24:54,"Well, if he leaves the dock with Sophia, comes back alone... somebody might notice."
398,00:24:54,00:24:56,So...
399,00:24:56,00:24:58,he just hoofs it out of here?
400,00:24:58,00:24:59,How?
401,00:24:59,00:25:03,"There's an access route about two miles east, but in this heat, no way."
402,00:25:07,00:25:09,"Well, if you kill somebody..."
403,00:25:09,00:25:11,you find a way.
404,00:25:11,00:25:13,Check it out.
405,00:25:23,00:25:26,WARRICK: Strike map from the National Lightning Detection Network.
406,00:25:26,00:25:27,(computer beeping)
407,00:25:27,00:25:30,This is Vegas in yellow.
408,00:25:36,00:25:39,Hasn't had a lightning strike in three days.
409,00:25:39,00:25:41,You got another theory?
410,00:25:41,00:25:45,All I got is a fried phone.
411,00:25:45,00:25:52,One point on the electrical path to ground.
412,00:25:52,00:25:57,"If the phone wasn't the way in, maybe it was the way out."
413,00:25:57,00:25:59,(grunting): You good on your end?
414,00:25:59,00:26:00,"Yeah, fine."
415,00:26:00,00:26:02,All right. That's good.
416,00:26:02,00:26:04,Good. This about it?
417,00:26:04,00:26:06,Yeah.
418,00:26:06,00:26:10,"Okay... now, electricity is fickle, right?"
419,00:26:10,00:26:11,Yeah.
420,00:26:11,00:26:16,One centimeter can mean the difference between a little zap and dead.
421,00:26:16,00:26:21,"So, let's assume that the current went out through his right index finger and the phone."
422,00:26:21,00:26:24,"For it to cross his heart, it must've come from the left side of his body, right?"
423,00:26:24,00:26:26,We've ruled out the fan and the chair.
424,00:26:26,00:26:29,"Can was in his left hand, so..."
425,00:26:29,00:26:33,the point of entry must've been somewhere else on his body.
426,00:26:41,00:26:44,WARRICK: His bare foot touched the floor.
427,00:27:01,00:27:03,Path of least resistance.
428,00:27:19,00:27:22,SIDLE: That's got to be a 50-foot drop.
429,00:27:22,00:27:25,"Yeah, but when you're young, it just looks like a whole lot of fun."
430,00:27:25,00:27:26,Not for Sophia.
431,00:27:27,00:27:29,"Come on, go for it."
432,00:27:29,00:27:30,"No, I don't... It'll be a rush."
433,00:27:30,00:27:31,I don't know. (screams)
434,00:27:34,00:27:35,(water splashes)
435,00:27:36,00:27:38,"Well, if that's where she died..."
436,00:27:38,00:27:43,the evidence isn't up here.
437,00:27:43,00:27:46,It's down there.
438,00:28:05,00:28:07,SANDERS: Catherine...
439,00:28:07,00:28:08,"Hey, I got your results."
440,00:28:08,00:28:14,"Found a therapeutic level of cough syrup in the baby's system, no more than the recommended dosage."
441,00:28:14,00:28:23,"So, between the cough syrup and the heat, Joshua probably fell asleep and the father forgot that he was there."
442,00:28:23,00:28:24,Maybe.
443,00:28:24,00:28:30,"I also found organophosphates, more specifically Disulfoton."
444,00:28:34,00:28:36,Pesticides.
445,00:28:40,00:28:43,What the hell's he doing with pesticides in his system?
446,00:28:50,00:28:52,(locker closes)
447,00:28:54,00:28:56,(doorbell rings)
448,00:28:56,00:29:00,"BRASS: Mrs. Winston, we have a warrant to search the premises."
449,00:29:00,00:29:03,WILLOWS: Where do you keep your gardening supplies?
450,00:29:20,00:29:21,Spiral search pattern.
451,00:29:21,00:29:23,The anchor chain is your center point.
452,00:29:23,00:29:24,"Do a 360, then drop your depth."
453,00:29:24,00:29:27,"Now, you're not done till you hit the bottom, okay?"
454,00:29:27,00:29:30,"SIDLE: You're looking for anything she might've hit her head on, probably something covered with algae."
455,00:29:30,00:29:32,STOKES: Good luck.
456,00:30:06,00:30:09,What do you got?
457,00:30:09,00:30:11,That's got to be Mark Young.
458,00:30:14,00:30:16,Yeah.
459,00:30:22,00:30:26,"Mr. and Mrs. Winston, why don't we get out of this heat?"
460,00:30:34,00:30:37,Why didn't you tell us you had another child who also died?
461,00:30:37,00:30:41,How dare you bring up Howard.
462,00:30:41,00:30:42,I'm a mother in mourning.
463,00:30:42,00:30:44,I've already buried one child.
464,00:30:44,00:30:46,I have to bury another.
465,00:30:46,00:30:50,"One was in God's hands, the other in theincapablehands of my husband."
466,00:30:50,00:30:51,Show some compassion.
467,00:30:52,00:30:53,I'm not the guilty one here!
468,00:30:53,00:30:55,I'm guilty.
469,00:30:55,00:30:58,I'm not a bad parent; I was negligent.
470,00:30:58,00:31:03,"I take full responsibility for what I did, but leave Howard out of it."
471,00:31:03,00:31:07,We found pesticides in Joshua's bloodstream.
472,00:31:07,00:31:10,I'm going to have to get a court order and exhume the body of your first child.
473,00:31:10,00:31:12,(sighs)
474,00:31:12,00:31:17,Vicky and I went through hell watching Howard deteriorate.
475,00:31:17,00:31:20,Can't you let my boy rest in peace?
476,00:31:20,00:31:23,I'm afraid not.
477,00:31:28,00:31:33,"ROBBINS: With exhumations, you always hope for a good embalmer, and I think we've got one."
478,00:31:33,00:31:36,Body's well-preserved.
479,00:31:36,00:31:38,Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder.
480,00:31:38,00:31:41,You see the retarded musculature?
481,00:31:41,00:31:43,Classic symptom.
482,00:31:43,00:31:46,"Night and day, compared to Joshua."
483,00:32:09,00:32:11,Quite a lot of Vitreous Fluid left.
484,00:32:11,00:32:14,I stand corrected-- greatembalmer.
485,00:32:18,00:32:19,Run this?
486,00:33:12,00:33:15,(whirring and clicking)
487,00:33:23,00:33:26,No cough syrup. No pesticides.
488,00:33:26,00:33:28,Traces of monocycline.
489,00:33:28,00:33:30,Anti-inflammatory.
490,00:33:30,00:33:34,Sometimes prescribed for Tay-Sachs.
491,00:33:34,00:33:41,"Well, it's the same principle of giving marijuana to glaucoma patients-- doesn't really cure the vision problems; it just buys you time."
492,00:33:41,00:33:42,Band-Aid.
493,00:33:42,00:33:43,Yeah.
494,00:33:43,00:33:46,Maybe the Winstons didn't want Howard to suffer.
495,00:33:46,00:33:49,"So, they don't kill their first child, who's dying."
496,00:33:49,00:33:52,"Why kill the second child, who's healthy?"
497,00:33:58,00:34:02,So both Howard and Joshua Winston were patients of yours?
498,00:34:02,00:34:05,Yes. I was with them when Howard died.
499,00:34:05,00:34:07,That was a dark time for them.
500,00:34:07,00:34:10,"And, I must say, it took a lot of courage for them to try again."
501,00:34:10,00:34:16,"And since both parents carry the Tay-Sachs allele, there was a 25% that the second child would be born with it."
502,00:34:16,00:34:20,But Joshua dodged the bullet.
503,00:34:20,00:34:24,We tested Vicki early in the second trimester; the results came back negative.
504,00:34:26,00:34:28,Had you seen Joshua recently?
505,00:34:28,00:34:30,A couple days before he died.
506,00:34:30,00:34:32,"It was a regular checkup, or...?"
507,00:34:32,00:34:36,"No. Vicki called in a panic, said something was wrong."
508,00:34:36,00:34:38,I told her to bring him right in.
509,00:34:38,00:34:43,"And despite the fetal test, Joshua seemed to be exhibiting all the classic signs of early Tay-Sachs."
510,00:34:43,00:34:47,"Floppiness, poor head control, unable to turn over, decreased muscle tone."
511,00:34:47,00:34:50,When they brought him in it was Howard all over again.
512,00:34:50,00:34:53,The only conclusion was that the fetal test was a false negative.
513,00:34:54,00:34:56,What are the odds?
514,00:34:56,00:34:57,Under one percent.
515,00:34:57,00:35:01,When I saw Joshua's retinas there were red spots-- classic Tay-Sachs.
516,00:35:01,00:35:03,I sent out an enzyme test to confirm it.
517,00:35:03,00:35:05,And did you confirm it?
518,00:35:05,00:35:07,Results haven't come back yet.
519,00:35:09,00:35:11,ROBBINS: Mark Young.
520,00:35:11,00:35:15,Cause of death is asphyxia due to fresh water drowning.
521,00:35:15,00:35:17,No bruises or other injuries.
522,00:35:17,00:35:21,Except for a ruptured tympanic membrane.
523,00:35:21,00:35:22,Hmm.
524,00:35:25,00:35:27,Hmm.
525,00:35:29,00:35:30,Tear's red.
526,00:35:30,00:35:31,It's ragged.
527,00:35:32,00:35:33,Ante-mortem injury.
528,00:35:33,00:35:36,"In water, burst eardrums typically result from rapid decent."
529,00:35:36,00:35:39,Sudden changes in pressure without equalizing.
530,00:35:39,00:35:41,STOKES: She went in first.
531,00:35:41,00:35:43,(screaming)
532,00:35:47,00:35:49,Whoo-hoo!
533,00:35:51,00:35:54,And he jumped in after her.
534,00:36:28,00:36:30,"This was an accident, Sara."
535,00:36:31,00:36:33,He was trying to save her.
536,00:36:33,00:36:34,That's a great theory.
537,00:36:34,00:36:35,But we can't prove that.
538,00:36:35,00:36:37,26 feet under with a busted eardrum?
539,00:36:37,00:36:39,"If not to save her, why dive that deep?"
540,00:36:39,00:36:40,I don't know.
541,00:36:42,00:36:44,Case is over.
542,00:36:45,00:36:46,Almost over.
543,00:36:46,00:36:55,BROWN: Found this mineral residue that led all the way from the massage chair to this burnt-out power strip across the room... water stain.
544,00:36:55,00:36:57,"Well, there's your conductor."
545,00:36:57,00:37:02,I also found them on the cookie sheet and this water-damaged magazine right here.
546,00:37:02,00:37:07,And I found this plastic bag in the kitchen garbage.
547,00:37:09,00:37:15,"""Ice Block."" Add that with the fan, you got yourself a homemade swamp cooler."
548,00:37:34,00:37:36,(electrical crackling)
549,00:37:39,00:37:40,(groaning)
550,00:37:41,00:37:43,Inventive.
551,00:37:43,00:37:45,Guy was just trying to stay cool.
552,00:37:52,00:37:53,Thanks.
553,00:37:53,00:37:56,"No, it's my pleasure."
554,00:38:00,00:38:01,"Hey, Nick."
555,00:38:01,00:38:02,Hey.
556,00:38:02,00:38:03,What are you doing?
557,00:38:03,00:38:05,What do you mean?
558,00:38:05,00:38:07,What did you tell him?
559,00:38:07,00:38:08,His son died a hero?
560,00:38:08,00:38:11,"Look, I'm just trying to give the guy a little peace, you know?"
561,00:38:11,00:38:14,"Oh, well, who are you trying to help feel better, him or you?"
562,00:38:14,00:38:20,"Hey, let me ask you something, Sara: you're Mr. Young, would you rather know this much or nothing at all?"
563,00:38:20,00:38:25,"You know, if the evidence doesn't support the answer, a CSI shouldn't be asking that question."
564,00:38:26,00:38:27,"Well, okay, if that works for you."
565,00:38:27,00:38:29,Be careful.
566,00:38:50,00:38:52,I was in the garden this weekend.
567,00:38:52,00:38:55,Why are you so interested in everything we do?
568,00:38:55,00:38:58,"I mean, when did our lives become an open book?"
569,00:38:58,00:39:02,When your second son ended up dead.
570,00:39:02,00:39:05,"When you were in the garden, was Joshua with you?"
571,00:39:05,00:39:06,No.
572,00:39:06,00:39:08,"Yes, he was."
573,00:39:08,00:39:09,We had a fight...
574,00:39:09,00:39:11,"Vicky, it's your turn."
575,00:39:11,00:39:12,I've had him for the past four hours.
576,00:39:13,00:39:14,"What, are you counting hours now?"
577,00:39:14,00:39:16,He's your son.
578,00:39:16,00:39:18,"Look, if you're not gardening here, then it's at work."
579,00:39:18,00:39:20,I've had him all day. It's your turn.
580,00:39:20,00:39:22,Here. Thank you.
581,00:39:22,00:39:24,"See the pretty flowers, Joshua?"
582,00:39:26,00:39:27,(sighs)
583,00:39:27,00:39:29,I guess he was.
584,00:39:29,00:39:32,But the moment he passed Joshua off to me I went inside.
585,00:39:32,00:39:34,Did you wash your hands?
586,00:39:34,00:39:37,"Honestly, I don't remember."
587,00:39:37,00:39:39,"I'm in the garden a lot, so I'm sure I washed my hands."
588,00:39:40,00:39:43,"Well, I met with your pediatrician, Dr. Garner."
589,00:39:43,00:39:51,"When you brought Joshua in on that emergency call, it was because you feared that he, too, had Tay-Sachs."
590,00:39:51,00:39:53,PAUL: We had the test before he was born.
591,00:39:53,00:39:55,Dr. Garner said we were fine.
592,00:39:56,00:39:58,I can imagine for both of you it must have been like reliving the nightmare.
593,00:39:59,00:40:01,"One child, now two."
594,00:40:02,00:40:12,"WILLOWS: Did you know that repeated exposure to certain pesticides, even in small amounts, can have an adverse effect in infants?"
595,00:40:12,00:40:14,Even mimic the signs of Tay-Sachs?
596,00:40:14,00:40:16,BRASS: The symptoms are similar.
597,00:40:16,00:40:19,"Floppiness of the head, arching of the back."
598,00:40:19,00:40:20,Blindness...
599,00:40:20,00:40:23,"inability to swallow. You know, like that."
600,00:40:23,00:40:27,"WILLOWS: You work with pesticides, Mrs. Winston, on your job and in your garden."
601,00:40:27,00:40:34,And you handled Joshua-- we suspect that that's how the traces got into his system.
602,00:40:34,00:40:42,"I'm just speculating here, but I think this is what happened next: No, Paul. I went through hell with Howard, I can't go through that with Joshua."
603,00:40:43,00:40:44,We'll wait for the enzyme tests.
604,00:40:44,00:40:47,No. No more tests. No more drugs.
605,00:40:47,00:40:49,No more kids.
606,00:40:49,00:40:50,No more!
607,00:40:50,00:40:54,"I can't live through that again, and neither can you."
608,00:40:58,00:41:03,"WILLOWS: You gave Joshua cough syrup, Mr. Winston."
609,00:41:03,00:41:05,Why did you medicate him?
610,00:41:05,00:41:10,"BRASS: 'Cause, maybe, you just didn't want him to suffer?"
611,00:41:28,00:41:29,(car alarm squeals)
612,00:41:31,00:41:34,(softly cries)
613,00:41:39,00:41:46,You have no idea what it's like to watch your child die.
614,00:41:47,00:41:49,We couldn't go through that again.
615,00:41:51,00:41:55,WILLOWS: The shame of it is you didn't have to.
616,00:41:56,00:41:57,(sighs)
617,00:41:57,00:42:01,The enzyme test that Dr. Garner ran came back negative.
618,00:42:03,00:42:06,Joshua didn't have Tay-Sachs.
619,00:42:09,00:42:12,You killed a perfectly healthy baby.
