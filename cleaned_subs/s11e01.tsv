0	00:00:02	00:00:06	WILLOWS said he had something to offer on the Dr. Jekyll case.
1	00:00:06	00:00:09	Were you two gonna fly this over my head? This was my decision, Jim.
2	00:00:09	00:00:10	Hey, last time I checked, CSI worked for me.
3	00:00:10	00:00:13	You need me; I don't need you.
4	00:00:13	00:00:15	I give you good information. I got you to the place.
5	00:00:15	00:00:17	Go back there and see what that guy's going.
6	00:00:17	00:00:19	(gunshots) Clark!
7	00:00:19	00:00:21	Come on, I'll buy you a drink at P.J.'s. I'll catch up to you.
8	00:00:21	00:00:23	You killed Jekyll.
9	00:00:23	00:00:25	You look like you came out of it relatively unscathed.
10	00:00:25	00:00:26	Good-bye, Nate.
11	00:00:42	00:00:45	Haskell...
12	00:00:47	00:00:49	Get in there!
13	00:00:59	00:01:02	I need emergency to lockup right now.
14	00:01:02	00:01:03	Come on. Come on...
15	00:01:03	00:01:04	Let's move!
16	00:01:04	00:01:06	Ray! Ray! Ray!
17	00:01:06	00:01:08	Come on! Ray!
18	00:01:08	00:01:10	Lockdown!
19	00:01:10	00:01:12	Ray!
20	00:01:12	00:01:13	Ray.
21	00:01:15	00:01:16	Ray, it's Catherine.
22	00:01:16	00:01:18	It's okay.
23	00:01:18	00:01:20	You're gonna be just fine.
24	00:01:20	00:01:21	All right, guys, watch out. We're coming through!
25	00:01:21	00:01:24	Stay with me, Ray.
26	00:01:24	00:01:26	I've tried paging ultrasound.
27	00:01:26	00:01:28	They're not responding.
28	00:01:28	00:01:30	Go another one coming in-- watch it!
29	00:01:30	00:01:32	Call respiratory-- I'm gonna need to intubate him.
30	00:01:32	00:01:33	Okay, set him here.
31	00:01:33	00:01:35	Ray, can you hear me?
32	00:01:35	00:01:37	Respiratory on the way.
33	00:01:37	00:01:39	Can you hear me?
34	00:01:39	00:01:40	Ray?
35	00:01:42	00:01:44	He can wait.
36	00:01:45	00:01:48	He's seizing... Give me five milligrams of Perced.
37	00:01:48	00:01:50	Open the I.V.-- wide open.
38	00:01:50	00:01:54	I'm going to start a second line, try to get some blood.
39	00:01:59	00:02:00	BP's 70/40.
40	00:02:00	00:02:01	Pulse is 140. He's crashing.
41	00:02:01	00:02:03	Prep O.R.
42	00:02:03	00:02:05	Gotta open him up, see what's going on inside.
43	00:02:06	00:02:07	Call X-Ray! Got a stat chest!
44	00:02:10	00:02:12	Ray...
45	00:02:12	00:02:15	would you like to pray together?
46	00:02:15	00:02:17	Don't be ashamed.
47	00:02:17	00:02:19	All the others did.
48	00:02:27	00:02:28	You're gonna be all right, Ray.
49	00:02:28	00:02:29	You're gonna be all right.
50	00:02:32	00:02:33	You're gonna be okay.
51	00:02:33	00:02:36	Ray... you're gonna be all right.
52	00:02:36	00:02:39	You're gonna be all right.
53	00:02:39	00:02:41	Call the O.R., tell 'em we're on the way right now.
54	00:02:41	00:02:43	You're gonna be okay. All right, let's move him. Here we go.
55	00:02:46	00:02:48	Clear, please!
56	00:03:24	00:03:32	I know your heart's in the right place, Nick, but the family, would be more comfortable if you weren't here.
57	00:03:32	00:03:38	Now, I've been where you are, I know how you feel, but sometimes the best thing is just to walk away.
58	00:03:38	00:03:41	Okay?
59	00:03:41	00:03:44	That's the right thing.
60	00:03:50	00:03:55	Officer Franklin Clark died a hero.
61	00:03:55	00:04:02	He wore the badge proudly, and he saw his life tragically cut short when he put duty ahead of all else.
62	00:04:04	00:04:08	He will be remembered as a family man...
63	00:04:08	00:04:10	as a friend...
64	00:04:10	00:04:21	and all of us who knew him, who will always remember him, we stand shoulder to shoulder in honoring his memory.
65	00:04:24	00:04:31	To Officer Clark's children, Tarik and Brandon, we promise you today...
66	00:04:31	00:04:37	that we will never let you forget what a great man your dad was.
67	00:04:37	00:04:39	Go back there and see what that guy's doing.
68	00:04:40	00:04:44	And as you stand with your family...
69	00:04:47	00:04:51	...know that we are your family, too.
70	00:04:51	00:04:53	You will never be alone.
71	00:04:55	00:04:57	Atten-hut!
72	00:04:57	00:04:59	Ready...
73	00:04:59	00:05:00	(bagpipes play Amazing Grace) ...fire!
74	00:05:00	00:05:01	Shotgun!
75	00:05:01	00:05:03	Fire! (rifles fire)
76	00:05:03	00:05:04	Clark!
77	00:05:04	00:05:06	(rifles fire) Fire!
78	00:05:06	00:05:08	Quarter arms.
79	00:05:08	00:05:17	Control advising all units, Officer Franklin Clark, P-number 4-3-5-2-8-4-- secure, final.
80	00:06:36	00:06:38	No, no, go back, go back, go back!
81	00:06:41	00:06:42	There's another bomb!
82	00:07:28	00:07:30	Yeah, three explosions, yes.
83	00:07:30	00:07:37	Two fatalities, about, uh, a dozen injured, three critical.
84	00:07:38	00:07:41	Well, it could have been a lot worse.
85	00:07:41	00:07:45	No, Mr. Mayor, I'm not trying to minimize the situation.
86	00:07:45	00:07:47	Look, do yourself a favor, turn on your television.
87	00:07:47	00:07:49	Nicky... can you hear me?
88	00:07:50	00:07:53	Tinnitis. (vomits)
89	00:07:53	00:07:54	It's temporary. So is the nausea.
90	00:07:54	00:07:57	Normal after you get hit with a blast wave.
91	00:07:58	00:08:01	I think I popped a couple stitches.
92	00:08:01	00:08:02	What tipped you off?
93	00:08:02	00:08:06	What? What tipped you off about the explosion?
94	00:08:06	00:08:07	Periplaneta Americana.
95	00:08:07	00:08:12	Cockroaches? Yeah, they were all over the van-- you know, daylight's not really their thing.
96	00:08:12	00:08:17	I think they were attracted to the clicking sound of the detonators, like a mating call or something.
97	00:08:17	00:08:18	Hey, thank God Okay.
98	00:08:18	00:08:19	you're okay, Nick.
99	00:08:19	00:08:21	Nate Haskell did this.
100	00:08:21	00:08:25	And if he'd stayed in prison where he belongs, I wouldn't have lost two of my men.
101	00:08:25	00:08:28	It's always easy to quarterback after the fact.
102	00:08:28	00:08:34	Bomb squad says it's all clear, it's yours. All right, well, I'm gonna need video from all the news teams.
103	00:08:34	00:08:36	On the ground and in the air. Okay.
104	00:08:37	00:08:40	Catch up with you later.
105	00:08:42	00:08:44	Oh, Nicky, why are you flanking me?
106	00:08:44	00:08:46	You've already been a hero today.
107	00:08:46	00:08:48	Go to the hospital.
108	00:08:48	00:08:50	I can't hear you. The hospital!
109	00:08:50	00:08:52	Not so fast.
110	00:08:52	00:08:54	This jacket's evidence.
111	00:08:54	00:08:57	Now, that was my best suit.
112	00:08:57	00:08:59	Have you seen your car?
113	00:09:03	00:09:12	Investigators are combing through the debris, looking for clues that might identify the perpetrators of this horrendous crime.
114	00:09:12	00:09:15	No one has stepped forward to claim credit for the bombing.
115	00:09:15	00:09:17	Sources within LVPD admit they have no solid lead...
116	00:09:17	00:09:18	How you feeling, man?
117	00:09:22	00:09:23	How's Nick?
118	00:09:23	00:09:25	He's lucky to be alive.
119	00:09:26	00:09:30	That's the fourth bomb dog in five minutes.
120	00:09:30	00:09:31	Should we evacuate?
121	00:09:31	00:09:33	Just a precaution.
122	00:09:35	00:09:38	You know what this button's for, right?
123	00:09:38	00:09:41	Morphine clouds my thinking.
124	00:09:41	00:09:42	Okay.
125	00:09:42	00:09:45	You're thinking Haskell did this?
126	00:09:45	00:09:47	But how'd he do it?
127	00:09:47	00:09:50	I mean, his mail and his phone calls are monitored by the penitentiary.
128	00:09:50	00:09:53	He has no contact with other inmates.
129	00:09:53	00:09:54	He'd have had to have outside help.
130	00:09:54	00:09:56	I mean, he's used acolytes before.
131	00:09:58	00:10:02	I need my laptop... and my cell phone, Jim.
132	00:10:02	00:10:03	Come on, Ray, give it a rest.
133	00:10:03	00:10:05	Don't forget my charger.
134	00:10:06	00:10:08	Okay.
135	00:10:09	00:10:11	I still owe you that drink.
136	00:10:11	00:10:12	Jim...
137	00:10:12	00:10:15	you talk to Haskell, you play your game, not his.
138	00:10:15	00:10:17	Okay.
139	00:10:22	00:10:25	Man's got an amazing attitude for a guy who lost a kidney.
140	00:10:25	00:10:27	Does he know that? Mm-hmm.
141	00:10:27	00:10:30	Fortunately, God gave him two.
142	00:10:38	00:10:40	How's Ray?
143	00:10:42	00:10:45	He's gonna make a full recovery.
144	00:10:45	00:10:47	Thank goodness.
145	00:10:47	00:10:54	I want Ray to live a long, long time, so that every time he unzips his pants to take a leak he'll think of me.
146	00:10:54	00:10:58	Yeah, he'll always remember what a putz you are.
147	00:10:58	00:11:00	You know, you're a smart guy, Nate.
148	00:11:00	00:11:03	You've been three steps ahead of us during this whole game.
149	00:11:03	00:11:04	Four.
150	00:11:04	00:11:06	Well, five.
151	00:11:06	00:11:10	But you're here to see if I decided to go out...
152	00:11:10	00:11:12	with a bang.
153	00:11:12	00:11:14	Did you?
154	00:11:14	00:11:16	What's different about you?
155	00:11:16	00:11:17	This has been so nice.
156	00:11:17	00:11:19	You're my first visitor.
157	00:11:19	00:11:21	Let me guess.
158	00:11:21	00:11:29	The blast turned over this new kinder, gentler leaf in you. If you don't mind, I'd like to eat my lunch.
159	00:11:29	00:11:31	Could you untie me, please?
160	00:11:35	00:11:37	Bon app√©tit.
161	00:11:37	00:11:42	Your next meal will be through a hole in a cell door.
162	00:11:42	00:11:43	Take him back to Ely.
163	00:11:50	00:11:57	Those, uh, prills are unexploded ammonium nitrate from your van bomb.
164	00:11:57	00:12:06	You know, you're lucky only one of those barrels went off, or we'd be scraping you up off the pavement with a putty knife, or a spatula. Yeah.
165	00:12:06	00:12:08	New bomb tech, huh?
166	00:12:08	00:12:09	You're Monahan, right?
167	00:12:09	00:12:14	Anyone crazy enough to wave a pistol at 100 armed cops...
168	00:12:14	00:12:16	You can call me Kacey.
169	00:12:16	00:12:18	Copy that.
170	00:12:18	00:12:21	All right, the brains of the bomb are usually within the first 20 yards.
171	00:12:21	00:12:23	Heavier stuff flies farther.
172	00:12:23	00:12:25	Detonators tend to be light.
173	00:12:25	00:12:30	And the brains should lead us to our big bad bomber.
174	00:13:11	00:13:16	Bomb was designed to maximize chaos... injuries.
175	00:13:16	00:13:21	Well, the good news-- it's left us a lot of evidence.
176	00:13:48	00:13:51	That looks like brain matter.
177	00:13:56	00:13:58	Cell phone detonator.
178	00:13:58	00:14:00	I haven't seen one of these since Iraq.
179	00:14:00	00:14:03	Does a cell phone trigger make a clicking sound?
180	00:14:03	00:14:05	Not usually.
181	00:14:05	00:14:08	We have got three different bombs.
182	00:14:08	00:14:11	Which means, there's possibly three detonators.
183	00:14:11	00:14:14	This is a composite image of the bomb site.
184	00:14:14	00:14:18	GCMS identified residue from the casket and tombstone bombs as smokeless gunpowder.
185	00:14:18	00:14:21	Specifically, Nosumi Pro Formula Four.
186	00:14:21	00:14:23	You can buy it at any gun store.
187	00:14:23	00:14:28	What it tells us is that the first two bombs were low explosive devices.
188	00:14:28	00:14:30	Low explosive. Why?
189	00:14:30	00:14:32	Easy to acquire, easy to build.
190	00:14:32	00:14:34	The van bomb's a different story.
191	00:14:34	00:14:36	It's high-explosive.
192	00:14:36	00:14:38	ANFO-- Ammonium Nitrate, Fuel Oil.
193	00:14:38	00:14:41	Same stuff that destroyed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
194	00:14:41	00:14:43	Yeah, it was the kill bomb.
195	00:14:43	00:14:45	Well, how do we think the bombs got there?
196	00:14:45	00:14:48	The casket bomb was placed with Officer Clark's body at the funeral home.
197	00:14:48	00:14:50	It's open 24/7. There's no security.
198	00:14:50	00:15:00	The Claymore was placed in a flower arrangement, which was delivered by a company called, uh, Bouquet Builders. Now, they reported their van stolen two days ago.
199	00:15:00	00:15:03	Let's go back to the low explosive devices.
200	00:15:03	00:15:09	First one-- the casket bomb, was designed to scare, not to kill.
201	00:15:13	00:15:16	Cops are trained to take cover under fire.
202	00:15:16	00:15:21	The only cover was the tombstones, right in the path of the second bomb.
203	00:15:23	00:15:28	There was only one way to go-- right into the path of the van bomb.
204	00:15:35	00:15:37	Shock.
205	00:15:37	00:15:39	Run.
206	00:15:39	00:15:41	Kill.
207	00:15:41	00:15:44	Bombers are unlike any other criminals, except poisoners.
208	00:15:44	00:15:50	They plan meticulously, they nurse long grudges, and they retaliate far out of proportion to any injury they feel they've received.
209	00:15:50	00:15:52	That sounds like Nate Haskell.
210	00:15:52	00:15:55	Nate Haskell likes to kill people one at a time.
211	00:15:55	00:15:59	Yeah, he gets off on the intimacy of inflicting pain and slow death.
212	00:15:59	00:16:00	He's not one for mass murder.
213	00:16:00	00:16:01	Are you saying it wasn't Nate Haskell?
214	00:16:01	00:16:03	Yes.
215	00:16:03	00:16:05	Then who the hell is it?
216	00:16:05	00:16:08	Someone with a grudge against cops.
217	00:16:31	00:16:33	Go home, Nicky.
218	00:16:33	00:16:34	You're tired.
219	00:16:37	00:16:39	No, I'm-I'm... I'm okay.
220	00:16:39	00:16:40	I mean, everybody's tired, right?
221	00:16:40	00:16:43	Everybody wasn't shot and then blown up.
222	00:16:44	00:16:46	It's not funny.
223	00:16:46	00:16:48	I almost lost you.
224	00:16:48	00:16:50	I almost lost Ray.
225	00:16:50	00:16:56	And I don't want to lose this case because you're maxed out.
226	00:16:56	00:16:58	You need to sit down with the department shrink.
227	00:16:58	00:17:01	Oh, come on. It's mandatory after a shooting incident.
228	00:17:01	00:17:03	Yeah, I-I know the rules.
229	00:17:03	00:17:04	But it's not about rules, Nicky.
230	00:17:04	00:17:06	It's about you.
231	00:17:06	00:17:12	Look, the time I waste talking to a shrink is time I could be helping you out on this case.
232	00:17:12	00:17:15	You can't just John Wayne this like everything else.
233	00:17:18	00:17:32	After losing Warrick, I thought, if I just worked hard enough, if I focused completely on the cases that I... I wouldn't have to think about his death.
234	00:17:33	00:17:38	There isn't enough work in the world...
235	00:17:42	00:17:49	I realized that I couldn't do my job without talking to somebody.
236	00:17:49	00:17:51	I never knew that about you.
237	00:17:51	00:17:52	Well, I'm...
238	00:17:52	00:17:55	I'm good at hiding things.
239	00:17:55	00:17:57	Like you.
240	00:17:59	00:18:03	Just ask yourself this, okay?
241	00:18:04	00:18:13	If you got a callout tomorrow to the restaurant where you got shot and Officer Clark died, could you focus?
242	00:18:13	00:18:16	Could you be there for your team?
243	00:18:16	00:18:20	Would you want you backing you up right now?
244	00:18:23	00:18:25	Make that call.
245	00:18:39	00:18:41	Officers Morales and Hooper.
246	00:18:41	00:18:43	Both had kids.
247	00:18:53	00:18:56	This poor soul's been through here twice.
248	00:18:56	00:18:59	Once in the line of duty, and then a bomb.
249	00:18:59	00:19:01	Makes you want to slug someone.
250	00:19:01	00:19:03	And then some.
251	00:19:03	00:19:06	Explosive must have been beneath his thorax.
252	00:19:06	00:19:09	Trauma lessens as it moves out from there.
253	00:19:09	00:19:11	Mostly plastic and wire. No shrapnel.
254	00:19:11	00:19:17	Consistent with our theory that the coffin bomb was designed to cause panic.
255	00:19:17	00:19:21	I can't stop thinking about his family.
256	00:19:21	00:19:26	Losing a husband is horrible enough without the funeral ending up like this.
257	00:19:26	00:19:28	I spoke to his wife.
258	00:19:28	00:19:30	Told her he was already in a better place.
259	00:19:30	00:19:32	Do you believe that?
260	00:19:32	00:19:36	I believe that it helped her.
261	00:19:47	00:19:52	Hmm... Maybe Officer Clark just helped us.
262	00:19:59	00:20:02	I may have found the bomber's signature.
263	00:20:02	00:20:06	You see the way the wires are twisted and then soldered?
264	00:20:06	00:20:11	Well, if you put a wire on a post and then twist it, most people are happy with that.
265	00:20:11	00:20:13	This guy soldered it, too.
266	00:20:13	00:20:16	He didn't leave anything to chance.
267	00:20:16	00:20:18	He is meticulous.
268	00:20:18	00:20:20	Maybe even OCD.
269	00:20:20	00:20:23	Sounds like you admire this guy.
270	00:20:23	00:20:25	(laughs) Yeah, I admire the work.
271	00:20:25	00:20:29	Doc Robbins just pulled this SIM card out of Officer Clark's body.
272	00:20:29	00:20:32	You want to bet that's from the cell phone that detonated the casket bomb?
273	00:20:32	00:20:36	Let's plug it in, and see who reached out and touched someone.
274	00:21:02	00:21:05	Hey, bomber, we got your number.
275	00:21:05	00:21:08	So the cell number came back to a Thomas Rand.
276	00:21:08	00:21:09	He's a local kid.
277	00:21:09	00:21:11	A Marine deployed to Afghanistan.
278	00:21:11	00:21:16	Says here he was a demolition specialist, 4th Engineers, 1st Marines.
279	00:21:16	00:21:17	So the guy knows bombs.
280	00:21:17	00:21:21	Yeah, but if you look at the bottom of the page, he was killed in action last month.
281	00:21:21	00:21:24	Well, maybe a friend or relative is looking for payback, huh?
282	00:21:24	00:21:27	Well, that's just what I'm going to ask his wife.
283	00:21:33	00:21:34	Mrs. Rand.
284	00:21:35	00:21:37	Hello.
285	00:21:37	00:21:39	Thank you for coming in.
286	00:21:39	00:21:41	I'm Captain Jim Brass.
287	00:21:41	00:21:48	Look, uh, I know your husband was killed recently, bravely serving our country in Afghanistan.
288	00:21:48	00:21:50	I'm sorry for your loss.
289	00:21:50	00:21:53	Yeah, that's what the Marines said when they came to the house.
290	00:21:53	00:21:55	The insurance agent...
291	00:21:55	00:21:57	Mrs. Rand, I know. I... I'm a former Marine.
292	00:21:57	00:21:58	I served in Vietnam.
293	00:21:58	00:22:01	I saw a lot. I lost a lot of friends. I understand your anger.
294	00:22:01	00:22:04	My daughter is four, and I have a son on the way.
295	00:22:04	00:22:05	All right.
296	00:22:05	00:22:08	What'd you do with your husband's cell phone, the 0-1-0-1 number?
297	00:22:10	00:22:11	I don't know.
298	00:22:11	00:22:14	I-I gave most of his stuff away to charity.
299	00:22:14	00:22:17	Why? Because it was used to detonate a bomb at a funeral.
300	00:22:19	00:22:21	Th-that policeman's funeral?
301	00:22:21	00:22:23	The-the one that's on the news?
302	00:22:23	00:22:25	Exactly.
303	00:22:25	00:22:26	So, what'd you do with it? Who'd you give it to?
304	00:22:26	00:22:28	A-A community center.
305	00:22:28	00:22:30	Um, it was a charity drive.
306	00:22:30	00:22:32	They were collecting cell phones for soldiers.
307	00:22:32	00:22:34	Which community center?
308	00:22:34	00:22:37	Are you ready for a new America?
309	00:22:37	00:22:39	Where hard work pays off?
310	00:22:40	00:22:44	This country's been hijacked by profiteers!
311	00:22:44	00:22:48	Big banks, Wall Street, giant corporations.
312	00:22:48	00:22:51	They have a license to steal at our expense.
313	00:22:51	00:22:54	(various shouts) Their credit cards keep us in debt.
314	00:22:54	00:22:56	That's it!
315	00:22:56	00:22:57	Their mortgages...
316	00:22:57	00:23:00	leverage the future of our families.
317	00:23:00	00:23:05	So what I say is, we stop playing their game.
318	00:23:07	00:23:09	That's right!
319	00:23:09	00:23:13	Stop paying our taxes that pay for their failures.
320	00:23:13	00:23:15	Yes! Cut up your cards!
321	00:23:15	00:23:18	Credit, driver's license, Social Security.
322	00:23:18	00:23:22	They can't control you if they can't find you.
323	00:23:23	00:23:34	Sure, there are those who say, hold on there, hold on there, Dr. Huxbee-- why can't we reason with Washington?
324	00:23:34	00:23:41	...engage in constructive dialogue, change our country from inside the system?
325	00:23:42	00:23:47	Brother Ralph Harvey went down that road, and where is he now?
326	00:23:47	00:23:51	He's in jail! Brother Ralph was exercising his right...
327	00:23:51	00:23:54	to drive his own car...
328	00:23:54	00:23:56	down a public road.
329	00:23:56	00:23:59	driving without a license.
330	00:23:59	00:24:01	Ralph is no criminal!
331	00:24:01	00:24:03	He's a decent man.
332	00:24:03	00:24:05	He took me and my brother when we didn't have anyone.
333	00:24:05	00:24:07	And now the government took him away from us.
334	00:24:07	00:24:09	And why?
335	00:24:09	00:24:15	Because Ralph dared to live as a new American.
336	00:24:15	00:24:18	And you see what happens when we speak truth to power.
337	00:24:18	00:24:21	The profiteers send in their mercenaries.
338	00:24:21	00:24:22	Las Vegas Police.
339	00:24:22	00:24:26	I need everyone to get up against the wall and let me see your hands.
340	00:24:26	00:24:30	Your authorities are not good here.
341	00:24:30	00:24:32	I'll give you authority if you don't get up against the wall.
342	00:24:32	00:24:34	Uh, no, no resistance, brothers and sisters.
343	00:24:34	00:24:36	Don't play their power game.
344	00:24:51	00:24:53	Just say no, huh?
345	00:24:53	00:24:55	Hey, you pack a real... mean right hook.
346	00:24:55	00:24:58	Like Gandhi, I turn the other cheek.
347	00:24:58	00:25:01	Just wasn't mine.
348	00:25:01	00:25:03	Look, I been, uh...
349	00:25:03	00:25:05	analyizing the blast patterns.
350	00:25:05	00:25:09	We've confirmed one initial device, followed by two secondaries.
351	00:25:09	00:25:10	It's all about timing.
352	00:25:10	00:25:17	If I'm the bomber, I'm not gonna set off those two explosions unless all of my targets are in the kill zone, right?
353	00:25:17	00:25:19	You think the bomber had eyes on.
354	00:25:19	00:25:20	He had to be there.
355	00:25:20	00:25:23	I've been looking for him in the news footage.
356	00:25:23	00:25:25	Here's what I've found.
357	00:25:27	00:25:30	That is not Southwest.
358	00:25:30	00:25:32	No, it's a radio- controlled model.
359	00:25:32	00:25:34	Here's what caught my attention.
360	00:25:34	00:25:37	The casket bomb goes off.
361	00:25:37	00:25:39	Cell phone detonated.
362	00:25:39	00:25:40	The Claymore.
363	00:25:40	00:25:44	At this point, the plane clearly loses control.
364	00:25:44	00:25:47	The van bomb goes off. Now...
365	00:25:47	00:25:54	a remote-controlled plane dips and crashes almost at the same time that the last two bombs go off.
366	00:25:54	00:25:56	They were radio-detonated.
367	00:25:56	00:25:58	Probably by the same controller.
368	00:25:58	00:25:59	Probably by whoever was flying the plane.
369	00:25:59	00:26:02	Remote-controlled planes have a range of about 2,500 feet.
370	00:26:02	00:26:07	That means those last two explosions could have been set off from no more than a half a mile.
371	00:26:09	00:26:12	Bomber's in the wind, but the plane isn't.
372	00:26:15	00:26:18	That's it, kiddo. Have a seat.
373	00:26:22	00:26:24	You got a wallet on you, boss?
374	00:26:31	00:26:32	No I.D., no credit card.
375	00:26:32	00:26:34	Do you got anything with your name on it?
376	00:26:34	00:26:35	I burned 'em.
377	00:26:35	00:26:37	Emancipated myself.
378	00:26:37	00:26:40	Okay, well, congratulations, you're not gonna need 'em where you're going.
379	00:26:40	00:26:41	Now, open up.
380	00:26:41	00:26:43	We're on the same side, sister.
381	00:26:43	00:26:47	I love this country, revere our Constitution.
382	00:26:47	00:26:50	But dark forces are afoot.
383	00:26:51	00:26:52	Think about who you really work for.
384	00:26:52	00:26:55	I work for the people of Clark County.
385	00:26:55	00:26:56	Do you?
386	00:26:56	00:26:58	Shut up.
387	00:26:58	00:27:00	Released?
388	00:27:00	00:27:07	Half of these dingbats were assaulting a police officer, including the one standing in front of you now. Yeah, I get it Jim, but you found no weapons or explosives on their premises.
389	00:27:07	00:27:11	Oh, a cell phone from their center detonated the bomb, so someone had to be involved.
390	00:27:11	00:27:13	Where's the evidence? Well, I don't know-- CSI's working on it.
391	00:27:13	00:27:15	It takes time.
392	00:27:15	00:27:16	These guys got no I.D.
393	00:27:16	00:27:19	You let them go, they're in the wind, it's buh-bye.
394	00:27:19	00:27:24	All right, we can legally hold them until we process the transitory evidence.
395	00:27:24	00:27:28	Lab is backed up, I'm not inclined to approve overtime, so... I can buy you 24 hours.
396	00:27:28	00:27:31	Okay.
397	00:27:48	00:27:49	All right.
398	00:27:49	00:27:51	I'm here.
399	00:27:51	00:27:54	Got a perfect view of the grave site.
400	00:27:54	00:27:55	How far away are you?
401	00:27:55	00:27:57	At least a football field.
402	00:27:57	00:28:00	You're still well within range.
403	00:28:00	00:28:03	Well, Ray, I don't see any plane around here.
404	00:28:03	00:28:05	Maybe he took it with him.
405	00:28:07	00:28:09	Nobody ever looks up.
406	00:28:09	00:28:11	Looks up what?
407	00:28:11	00:28:12	Looks up looks up.
408	00:28:12	00:28:14	In the sky.
409	00:28:14	00:28:17	In plane sight.
410	00:28:41	00:28:45	You asked me if a cell phone detonator could make a click-click.
411	00:28:45	00:28:47	No.
412	00:28:47	00:28:50	But a radio-controlled detonator...
413	00:28:52	00:28:53	(quiet, rhythmic clicking) Are you hearing that?
414	00:28:53	00:28:56	I switched the frequency.
415	00:28:56	00:29:00	I found this 18 yards from the van bomb.
416	00:29:00	00:29:05	It's a servo switch, just like the one that operates this plane.
417	00:29:05	00:29:06	See?
418	00:29:08	00:29:14	It's clicking because it's searching for a signal from the radio controller and not finding one.
419	00:29:14	00:29:15	I switched it back to A.
420	00:29:17	00:29:19	(whirrs) And we are back in business.
421	00:29:22	00:29:28	So some guy's innocently flying this plane around, he flicks a switch and... he's a bomber?
422	00:29:46	00:29:48	Somebody please give me some good news.
423	00:29:48	00:29:49	That shiner'll go away in about a week.
424	00:29:49	00:29:55	(groans) The last two bombs were radio-controlled, detonated by whoever was flying that model airplane around.
425	00:29:55	00:29:59	The better news is that Greg got a print off of it.
426	00:29:59	00:30:01	Came back to an Alex McCann, 21.
427	00:30:01	00:30:02	Went through foster care.
428	00:30:02	00:30:06	He's already in the system for B&amp;E, couple of petties.
429	00:30:06	00:30:09	We got a McCann in custody-- a Jason McCann.
430	00:30:09	00:30:12	Yeah, yeah, that was one of the people that I processed.
431	00:30:12	00:30:13	16 years old.
432	00:30:13	00:30:14	Could be a younger brother.
433	00:30:14	00:30:16	Certainly old enough to be involved.
434	00:30:16	00:30:22	Well, the owner of Hank's Hobby Shop said the kid that bought that plane fit Jason's description, so... So let me get my hooks into him.
435	00:30:22	00:30:26	He's not gonna talk to you. Okay, well, are you gonna tell me how to do my job again?
436	00:30:26	00:30:27	We know how well that turned out, right?
437	00:30:27	00:30:29	I'm gonna tell you how not to blow this.
438	00:30:29	00:30:31	In case you haven't noticed, it's already blown.
439	00:30:31	00:30:35	All right, let me go. What are you gonna do, Nick, give the kid a lollipop?
440	00:30:35	00:30:36	It's the least I can do for Officer Clark.
441	00:30:36	00:30:38	I mean, I owe him that much, don't you think?
442	00:30:45	00:30:49	Where's your gun, your vest, your badge?
443	00:30:50	00:30:58	You off work or something? Well, no, I only wear my vest when I'm in the field, and you can't really have your gun on in this room, and I'm not a cop, so I don't have a badge.
444	00:30:58	00:31:00	I just... have an I.D.
445	00:31:00	00:31:01	You still represent the authority.
446	00:31:01	00:31:04	Everything I hate.
447	00:31:04	00:31:06	Just like... you probably hate me.
448	00:31:06	00:31:11	No, what I hate's got nothing to do with you, man.
449	00:31:11	00:31:16	You know what I really hate right now, it's kind of eating me alive?
450	00:31:16	00:31:23	A few days ago, a police officer lost his life on my watch, 'cause I didn't have his back.
451	00:31:23	00:31:26	And he had a wife and two kids.
452	00:31:26	00:31:32	When I went to the funeral to pay my respects, his family asked me to leave.
453	00:31:32	00:31:35	I hated that, you know.
454	00:31:38	00:31:43	But I got involved in law enforcement because I want to try and help people.
455	00:31:43	00:31:46	And that's the only reason I'm here, man, is trying to help you out.
456	00:31:46	00:31:49	Do you have a brother named Alex?
457	00:31:51	00:31:53	(sighs) Hm?
458	00:31:53	00:32:02	Well, if you really love him and you don't want any more people to die, you need to go ahead and tell me where he is right now.
459	00:32:03	00:32:05	They're gonna kill him, aren't they?
460	00:32:05	00:32:07	Not if I can help it.
461	00:32:07	00:32:11	I didn't have anything to do with the bombs, I swear.
462	00:32:11	00:32:13	I just bought the airplane. I believe you.
463	00:32:13	00:32:16	But what's the deal with your brother?
464	00:32:18	00:32:22	When the cops arrested Ralph, Alex snapped.
465	00:32:22	00:32:24	Ralph was like a father to us.
466	00:32:24	00:32:27	He was a decent man.
467	00:32:27	00:32:29	And the cops treated him like a lowlife.
468	00:32:29	00:32:37	So your brother's waging war against the entire Las Vegas police force because of the way that Ralph was treated? He told me he was just gonna throw a scare in the cops.
469	00:32:37	00:32:44	Not blow them up. Okay, look, all you're guilty of right now is buying a model airplane-- and that's not a crime, last time I checked.
470	00:32:44	00:32:48	But it is a crime to make bombs and go around trying to kill people, like your brother's doing.
471	00:32:48	00:32:51	So you got to go ahead and tell me where he is, Jason. I can't.
472	00:32:51	00:32:53	Why not?
473	00:32:53	00:33:00	If you really want to protect him, you've got to help me get him into custody as soon as possible before somebody else gets hurt.
474	00:33:02	00:33:04	Where is he?
475	00:33:04	00:33:06	He's got a house in Old Henderson.
476	00:33:06	00:33:08	Where?
477	00:33:08	00:33:09	On Landon. Landon.
478	00:33:09	00:33:11	Good man.
479	00:33:11	00:33:12	You better hurry.
480	00:33:12	00:33:15	That show at the funeral was just fireworks compared to what's coming.
481	00:33:20	00:33:22	I don't see anybody inside.
482	00:33:31	00:33:35	Okay, I've got to tell you, Nick-- that is a really bad idea.
483	00:33:35	00:33:39	Well, I appreciate you having so much confidence in me, but ARMOR's still 20 minutes out, and according to that kid Jason...
484	00:33:39	00:33:41	I get it. We don't have time.
485	00:33:41	00:33:44	But can we just make sure we don't blow us both up?
486	00:33:44	00:33:47	That's a good idea, yeah.
487	00:34:04	00:34:06	Trip wire.
488	00:34:06	00:34:07	Seriously? Uh-huh.
489	00:34:12	00:34:14	There's no battery.
490	00:34:14	00:34:16	Okay.
491	00:34:16	00:34:17	We are in luck.
492	00:34:17	00:34:19	The circuit's not powered.
493	00:34:37	00:34:40	Ray, we're inside.
494	00:34:55	00:34:59	Okay, we've got nine empty bomb cases and a bowl of ice.
495	00:34:59	00:35:02	Ice means he hasn't been gone that long.
496	00:35:02	00:35:05	There's some white crystals here-- it looks like some meth.
497	00:35:05	00:35:06	Hold on.
498	00:35:09	00:35:10	Kacey?
499	00:35:10	00:35:11	We're okay.
500	00:35:11	00:35:13	He's using TATP.
501	00:35:13	00:35:15	Triacetone triperoxide.
502	00:35:15	00:35:19	You pack those pipes with it, it'll bring down a casino.
503	00:35:20	00:35:21	Tell me more about the ice.
504	00:35:21	00:35:25	Well, you need a serious chill to precipitate the explosive but...
505	00:35:25	00:35:28	looks like our boy didn't finish the job.
506	00:35:28	00:35:30	Maybe this is the reason why.
507	00:35:30	00:35:32	Hydrochloric acid.
508	00:35:32	00:35:35	Final mixer in the TATP cocktail.
509	00:35:35	00:35:36	Bottle's empty.
510	00:35:36	00:35:38	Maybe Alex went shopping.
511	00:35:55	00:35:58	Alex McCann, you're under arrest!
512	00:35:58	00:36:01	Get your hands in the air, get down on the ground.
513	00:36:02	00:36:04	Get down on the ground right now!
514	00:36:05	00:36:08	Son, drop the bag and get down!
515	00:36:10	00:36:12	No... No, no, no!
516	00:36:20	00:36:21	Nick, drop it.
517	00:36:21	00:36:23	Nicky! Huh?
518	00:36:23	00:36:25	Drop it. You all right? Yeah.
519	00:36:25	00:36:27	You all right? Huh? Yeah.
520	00:36:27	00:36:28	Dispatch, this is Ida three-two.
521	00:36:28	00:36:30	We have a male suspect down.
522	00:36:30	00:36:32	Requesting EMS.
523	00:36:33	00:36:35	Ida three-two, copy that.
524	00:36:35	00:36:36	EMS has been notified.
525	00:37:05	00:37:06	He was planning to hit PD.
526	00:37:06	00:37:10	Well, you just saved a lot of cops' lives.
527	00:37:12	00:37:17	Next time Brass tries to beat you up, or you beat yourself up, remember that.
528	00:37:21	00:37:23	Well, the bomber's dead.
529	00:37:23	00:37:25	That's one less wack job running loose in the world.
530	00:37:25	00:37:27	I call that a good day's work.
531	00:37:27	00:37:30	Where are we with our friends from the community center?
532	00:37:30	00:37:32	Well, none of them had criminal records.
533	00:37:32	00:37:35	Nothing ties them to the bombing, so I let them walk.
534	00:37:35	00:37:37	Except the younger brother. He had prior knowledge.
535	00:37:37	00:37:39	The D.A.'s going to want to talk to him.
536	00:37:50	00:37:52	I didn't wake you, did I?
537	00:37:53	00:37:57	I brought you a little something.
538	00:37:57	00:37:58	Is it a tie?
539	00:38:00	00:38:01	Okay.
540	00:38:11	00:38:14	That's beautiful. Thank you.
541	00:38:14	00:38:16	You're going to be out of here in a few days.
542	00:38:16	00:38:18	It'll help you get back on your feet.
543	00:38:20	00:38:25	When I lost my legs, I had to let go of some dreams.
544	00:38:25	00:38:30	I was never going to be Fred Astaire.
545	00:38:30	00:38:32	Lost a little off my jump shot.
546	00:38:32	00:38:37	But I still dance with my wife and shoot hoops once a week.
547	00:38:39	00:38:41	I'm never going to be a kidney donor.
548	00:38:41	00:38:43	Ray...
549	00:38:43	00:38:52	no matter how much we think we can control in life, there's always going to be this much we have no control over.
550	00:38:52	00:38:55	When you accept that, you can move on.
551	00:39:34	00:39:36	I thought you went home.
552	00:39:36	00:39:37	Oh, I'm trying.
553	00:39:37	00:39:41	I'm too tired.
554	00:39:44	00:39:45	Where are we headed?
555	00:39:45	00:39:48	You're going home.
556	00:39:48	00:39:49	I'll take Greg.
557	00:40:07	00:40:09	Hey. Hi.
558	00:40:09	00:40:10	Where we headed, Andy?
559	00:40:10	00:40:13	Uh, just, uh, follow your noses.
560	00:40:15	00:40:18	Phew! Akers wasn't kidding.
561	00:40:18	00:40:21	I smell urine, alcohol...
562	00:40:21	00:40:23	No decomp, though. This is recent.
563	00:40:23	00:40:27	Caucasian male, between 30 and 50 years old.
564	00:40:27	00:40:29	It's hard to tell with these homeless guys.
565	00:40:29	00:40:32	Somebody called it in about, uh, 20 minutes ago.
566	00:40:34	00:40:35	You need some sleep, Lou.
567	00:40:35	00:40:37	Don't we all?
568	00:40:39	00:40:41	Blunt force trauma.
569	00:40:41	00:40:44	Looks like somebody dragged him.
570	00:40:44	00:40:47	There's a pup tent and some old bottles back there.
571	00:40:47	00:40:48	He might have been squatting.
572	00:40:48	00:40:49	Why don't you guys take the blood trail?
573	00:40:49	00:40:51	I'll take Mr. Aromatic.
574	00:40:55	00:40:59	Every so often, a trash run? Kind of refreshing.
575	00:40:59	00:41:01	That's the spirit, David.
576	00:41:13	00:41:15	Spatter.
577	00:41:15	00:41:16	Looks like we found our primary.
578	00:41:16	00:41:18	There's the tent.
579	00:41:20	00:41:21	Damn.
580	00:41:21	00:41:24	Do you have any extra batteries?
581	00:41:24	00:41:29	Why kill a guy and drag him into the middle of an empty room?
582	00:41:42	00:41:44	Thanks.
583	00:41:48	00:41:49	David, wait.
584	00:41:53	00:41:56	Lou! Greg! Don't touch anything!
585	00:42:03	00:42:05	We're okay.
586	00:42:07	00:42:09	Thanks.
587	00:42:20	00:42:21	It isn't over.
