0	00:00:23	00:00:27	Kid on the ATV rolled up on a mountain lion mauling a body.
1	00:00:27	00:00:29	He made a serious U-turn and called it in.
2	00:00:29	00:00:31	But where is the perp now?
3	00:00:31	00:00:32	Animal Control is on the scene.
4	00:00:32	00:00:33	They're looking for him.
5	00:00:33	00:00:35	Body up here? Yeah.
6	00:00:35	00:00:38	No I.D. yet.
7	00:00:43	00:00:47	Leotard-- not exactly dressed for the mountains.
8	00:00:47	00:00:49	She was definitely not out here hiking.
9	00:00:53	00:00:56	Looks like she tried to crawl back up to the road for help.
10	00:00:56	00:00:58	I didn't see a car.
11	00:00:58	00:01:00	The nearest house is ten miles away.
12	00:01:00	00:01:01	How did she get out here?
13	00:01:09	00:01:11	Bite marks.
14	00:01:11	00:01:13	The surrounding tissue is contused.
15	00:01:13	00:01:14	The bite's antemortem.
16	00:01:14	00:01:17	She was alive when she was attacked.
17	00:01:22	00:01:24	Lion may have left something behind.
18	00:01:24	00:01:26	Piece of a tooth.
19	00:01:27	00:01:29	Maybe he bit off more than he could chew.
20	00:01:30	00:01:34	Sara, I don't think that a lion could have done all this damage.
21	00:01:34	00:01:40	She's got fresh knuckle contusions around her eyes and older symmetrical bruises on her legs.
22	00:01:40	00:01:41	Could be from restraints.
23	00:01:41	00:01:47	A young woman out here in the middle of nowhere? Maybe she escaped from one animal only to fall prey to another.
24	00:02:30	00:02:32	Oh, man.
25	00:02:32	00:02:33	You okay?
26	00:02:33	00:02:37	Now I know why you can get a steak and eggs for $1.99 in this town.
27	00:02:37	00:02:40	Well, the funny thing is, the casino's probably losing money. (groans)
28	00:02:40	00:02:41	But you're in the door.
29	00:02:41	00:02:46	Drop a couple 20's in the nickel machines, and at least you can say to yourself, I ate for cheap.
30	00:02:46	00:02:50	I had three orders, man, and I still ate for cheap.
31	00:02:50	00:02:54	(chuckles) Hey, you think three steaks and six eggs is bad for you, Doctor?
32	00:02:54	00:02:56	You know what coroners say, Nick.
33	00:02:56	00:02:58	Everybody eventually dies of a heart attack.
34	00:02:58	00:03:00	Ayúdame!Help!
35	00:03:00	00:03:01	Ayúdame!
36	00:03:01	00:03:02	What's going on?
37	00:03:02	00:03:03	A girl-- she's dead.
38	00:03:03	00:03:05	I saw her through the window.
39	00:03:05	00:03:06	No, no one home!
40	00:03:06	00:03:07	No one home!
41	00:03:07	00:03:10	Dispatch, this is Charlie-05 Stokes.
42	00:03:10	00:03:14	I got a possible 405-Zebra at Goodland and Erwin.
43	00:03:14	00:03:15	Roll medical my location.
44	00:03:15	00:03:17	Copy that.
45	00:03:20	00:03:21	Las Vegas Police!
46	00:03:26	00:03:28	Vegas Police!
47	00:03:28	00:03:29	Anybody home?!
48	00:03:39	00:03:41	Oh, no.
49	00:03:50	00:03:52	No pulse...
50	00:03:52	00:03:54	but warm to the touch.
51	00:03:54	00:03:56	This just happened.
52	00:03:56	00:03:57	What a shame.
53	00:03:57	00:04:00	Yeah. Just stay with her.
54	00:04:00	00:04:01	I'll get my kit.
55	00:04:01	00:04:03	I'll call David.
56	00:04:10	00:04:11	Nick! Yeah.
57	00:04:11	00:04:13	She's pregnant.
58	00:04:14	00:04:15	Fetus is moving!
59	00:04:15	00:04:18	We gotta get the baby out now! Give me your knife.
60	00:04:21	00:04:24	Put her on the bed, right here.
61	00:04:24	00:04:27	We're gonna do a crash C-section.
62	00:04:27	00:04:29	Find me something to put the baby in.
63	00:04:29	00:04:31	She's almost to term.
64	00:04:31	00:04:32	Here we go.
65	00:04:33	00:04:35	(groans) All right, Nick, I'm gonna need your hands.
66	00:04:35	00:04:40	Yeah. Hold the abdomen and the uterus open Okay. as wide as you can.
67	00:04:40	00:04:42	That's it! Wider! (groans)
68	00:04:46	00:04:47	Oh, she's not breathing.
69	00:04:47	00:04:49	Okay, you got a clamp or forceps? Anything?
70	00:04:49	00:04:50	Yeah, yeah. That's it, that's it.
71	00:04:50	00:04:52	Close to the navel as you can.
72	00:04:52	00:04:54	That's it.
73	00:04:54	00:04:55	All right.
74	00:04:55	00:04:56	Okay, just...
75	00:04:58	00:04:59	Give me a pen.
76	00:04:59	00:05:01	Take the top off it. That's it.
77	00:05:04	00:05:05	Where's the top?
78	00:05:05	00:05:07	All right.
79	00:05:10	00:05:11	Come on, Doc...
80	00:05:13	00:05:15	She's still not breathing.
81	00:05:15	00:05:17	Okay, here we go.
82	00:05:17	00:05:18	Don't die.
83	00:05:19	00:05:20	Come on, come on...
84	00:05:21	00:05:22	Come on, Doc.
85	00:05:24	00:05:25	There it is! Ah!
86	00:05:25	00:05:27	Oh, God!
87	00:05:27	00:05:28	That's it! That's it.
88	00:05:28	00:05:30	Good little girl.
89	00:05:30	00:05:32	Oh, man, good job. Good job.
90	00:05:32	00:05:34	Okay, she's gonna need respiratory support.
91	00:05:34	00:05:36	Here you go.
92	00:05:38	00:05:40	Oh, I got ya.
93	00:05:47	00:05:50	Looks like a compression fracture of the tib-fib.
94	00:05:50	00:05:54	More than likely a vertical drop as opposed to a slide down a hillside.
95	00:05:54	00:05:55	Mm-hmm.
96	00:05:55	00:05:57	She has deep gouges in both legs.
97	00:05:57	00:06:03	To a hungry carnivore, her calves are like a porterhouse steak; thick, meaty, bone in.
98	00:06:03	00:06:06	It's hard to see at night, but her jaw's broken.
99	00:06:06	00:06:07	Blunt-force trauma injury.
100	00:06:07	00:06:11	I don't know any lions with a good right hook.
101	00:06:11	00:06:12	Neither do I.
102	00:06:13	00:06:16	Some broken teeth. Some missing.
103	00:06:16	00:06:18	Six and 11 show signs of dental work.
104	00:06:18	00:06:23	And these posts I'm seeing suggest prosthetics.
105	00:06:24	00:06:27	Maybe this broken tooth isn't feline; maybe it's hers.
106	00:06:31	00:06:34	There's an unusual amount of trace on this body.
107	00:06:34	00:06:39	Considering the fall she took, the way she was dragged through the woods, she would have shed most of it.
108	00:06:39	00:06:41	But she hasn't. She's covered in pine needles.
109	00:06:41	00:06:42	I didn't see any pine trees at the scene.
110	00:06:42	00:06:44	I didn't either.
111	00:06:49	00:06:52	I think I may have the answer.
112	00:06:52	00:06:56	I have two burn marks here, four centimeters apart.
113	00:06:56	00:07:00	These look like they might be injuries from a stun gun.
114	00:07:00	00:07:06	A stun gun would have imparted the body with electrical current turning the victim into a human lint brush.
115	00:07:06	00:07:09	Stun gun would have put her down for about a minute.
116	00:07:09	00:07:12	Enough time to allow trace to adhere to her body through static electricity.
117	00:07:15	00:07:17	She's in the system.
118	00:07:17	00:07:19	Iona Vail. Social worker.
119	00:07:19	00:07:21	Health card from Hope's Path.
120	00:07:21	00:07:23	The battered women's shelter. Yeah.
121	00:07:24	00:07:30	Spends her life helping women dodge punches, but she couldn't dodge this one.
122	00:07:30	00:07:32	When was the last time that you saw Iona?
123	00:07:32	00:07:37	Uh, it was about six weeks ago.
124	00:07:37	00:07:39	She told me she was quitting.
125	00:07:39	00:07:46	It was right after she broke up with her boyfriend; no good-bye, nothing. And how long have you and Iona been running the shelter?
126	00:07:46	00:07:48	Together?
127	00:07:48	00:07:49	About two years.
128	00:07:49	00:07:52	I was, uh, one of these women once.
129	00:07:52	00:07:59	I walked in the door, and there was Iona with her easy, everything's gonna be all right smile.
130	00:07:59	00:08:01	And it was.
131	00:08:01	00:08:03	You never went home?
132	00:08:03	00:08:06	Iona made me see it wasn't worthy of the name.
133	00:08:06	00:08:09	No, this is where I belong.
134	00:08:09	00:08:13	Women's shelter-- you must get more than a few threats.
135	00:08:13	00:08:14	It's an occupational hazard.
136	00:08:14	00:08:22	Every woman in here is a victim of violence, which means that someone out there-- husband, boyfriend-- is a potential threat.
137	00:08:22	00:08:24	Did anyone ever threaten Iona?
138	00:08:24	00:08:26	Not to my knowledge.
139	00:08:27	00:08:29	That was Iona's desk.
140	00:08:29	00:08:31	She never even came back for her stuff.
141	00:08:31	00:08:34	Do you mind if I take a look?
142	00:08:46	00:08:47	I'd like to take this.
143	00:08:47	00:08:48	Yeah, whatever you need.
144	00:08:48	00:08:50	Please...
145	00:08:50	00:08:53	just find whoever did this.
146	00:09:00	00:09:03	Maria Diorio. Just 17.
147	00:09:03	00:09:06	Junior at Carver High.
148	00:09:06	00:09:07	Albert...
149	00:09:07	00:09:11	what you did today was incredible.
150	00:09:13	00:09:16	It was like being part of a miracle or something.
151	00:09:16	00:09:19	It felt good helping the living for a change.
152	00:09:19	00:09:21	You're a good man.
153	00:09:24	00:09:29	Petechial hemorrhaging present in the eyes, inside the lips.
154	00:09:29	00:09:32	C.O.D. is asphyxiation. No ligature marks.
155	00:09:32	00:09:34	Blood didn't get a chance to settle.
156	00:09:34	00:09:35	Pregnant girl. Teen suicide.
157	00:09:35	00:09:37	With or without ligature marks, it's pretty straightforward.
158	00:09:37	00:09:40	I thought so, too, until I found these.
159	00:09:40	00:09:47	Four simultaneous contused finger impressions on the back of the forearm, a single thumb impression on the front.
160	00:09:47	00:09:49	Same on this side.
161	00:09:49	00:09:50	Forcibly grabbed.
162	00:09:50	00:09:55	The fact that we can even see the bruises tells me they were inflicted less than two hours before her death.
163	00:09:55	00:09:57	So there was definitely a struggle before she died.
164	00:09:57	00:10:01	Leading cause of death in pregnant women is expectant fathers.
165	00:10:09	00:10:12	I'm looking for someone in charge.
166	00:10:12	00:10:14	I was told my daughter is here.
167	00:10:14	00:10:15	Her name is Maria.
168	00:10:15	00:10:17	Maria Diorio.
169	00:10:19	00:10:22	Mrs. Diorio, my name is Nick Stokes.
170	00:10:22	00:10:24	I'm a crime scene investigator.
171	00:10:24	00:10:25	I'm handling Maria's case.
172	00:10:25	00:10:27	I'm so sorry for your loss.
173	00:10:27	00:10:31	But the good news is your granddaughter's still fighting the good fight over at Desert Palm.
174	00:10:31	00:10:32	Granddaughter?
175	00:10:32	00:10:35	You must have my daughter confused with somebody else.
176	00:10:35	00:10:37	Let's sit down here.
177	00:10:37	00:10:39	I don't want to sit down.
178	00:10:39	00:10:40	I want to know what the hell happened.
179	00:10:40	00:10:43	When I left for work this morning, Maria was fine.
180	00:10:43	00:10:46	No, ma'am, she was eight- and-a-half-months pregnant.
181	00:10:46	00:10:48	What are you talking about?!
182	00:10:48	00:10:50	Maria wasn't having sex.
183	00:10:50	00:10:52	I helped deliver the baby.
184	00:10:52	00:10:55	Why don't we have a seat?
185	00:11:02	00:11:04	I don't understand any of this.
186	00:11:04	00:11:09	Did Maria have a boyfriend?
187	00:11:09	00:11:11	I don't know.
188	00:11:11	00:11:14	She had a few dates here and there.
189	00:11:14	00:11:17	And do you know any of the names of the guys she dated?
190	00:11:17	00:11:20	We live under the same roof, but we hardly talked.
191	00:11:22	00:11:24	She blamed me for her dad's death.
192	00:11:25	00:11:27	He had a heart attack.
193	00:11:29	00:11:33	And he's left me to pick up the pieces, and I'm hardly holding it together.
194	00:11:35	00:11:36	I can't handle this right now.
195	00:11:36	00:11:43	I understand, but-but now, I can have an officer drive you to the hospital, if you'd like to see your granddaughter.
196	00:12:22	00:12:24	Hey, Sara. Hey.
197	00:12:24	00:12:28	I've been going through Iona's stuff from the shelter.
198	00:12:28	00:12:33	According to her date book, her last appointment, right before she disappeared, was with a Dr. K.
199	00:12:38	00:12:40	This changes everything.
200	00:12:44	00:12:46	Lady Heather?
201	00:12:46	00:12:49	Actually, it's Dr. Kessler now.
202	00:12:49	00:12:51	It's good to see you, Sara.
203	00:12:51	00:12:52	How's Gil? How are the Moche?
204	00:12:52	00:12:54	Both still in Peru.
205	00:12:55	00:12:57	And you must be Dr. Langston.
206	00:12:59	00:13:01	I've been expecting you.
207	00:13:06	00:13:12	Iona came to see me after exhausting more conventional psychotherapy-- a diagnosis of exclusion, if you like.
208	00:13:12	00:13:16	According to these, Doctor, you're a sex therapist.
209	00:13:16	00:13:19	What exactly were Iona's issues?
210	00:13:19	00:13:21	Iona was robbed of her childhood.
211	00:13:21	00:13:27	Her mother died when she was young, her father hit the bottle, and Iona was left to raise her four siblings.
212	00:13:27	00:13:30	So naturally, she was drawn to looking after and protecting other women.
213	00:13:30	00:13:34	Her entire life, Iona took care of others to the detriment of her own needs.
214	00:13:34	00:13:40	My job was to help her express a deep-seated longing for love and nurture.
215	00:13:40	00:13:41	And you did that how?
216	00:13:41	00:13:46	I didn't diagnose three nights in Lady Heather's dungeon.
217	00:13:46	00:13:50	I suggested she express herself through Gestalt role-playing.
218	00:13:50	00:13:52	And what was that role?
219	00:13:52	00:13:56	After preliminary psychotherapy, she imagined herself as a cat.
220	00:13:56	00:13:57	A cat?
221	00:13:57	00:13:58	That was her starting point.
222	00:13:58	00:14:01	Did she have a cat as a child?
223	00:14:01	00:14:02	Yes, growing up.
224	00:14:02	00:14:08	The one member of her broken family who never wanted for affection was a plump little tabby.
225	00:14:08	00:14:10	You're not serious.
226	00:14:10	00:14:16	Role-play is a legitimate form of therapy-- a safe way to access one's desires...
227	00:14:16	00:14:18	and one's demons.
228	00:14:18	00:14:20	Right, Doctor?
229	00:14:20	00:14:22	You're the expert.
230	00:14:26	00:14:32	During Iona's cat role-playing, did, uh, she ever express a desire to get eaten by a mountain lion?
231	00:14:32	00:14:33	Because that's how she died.
232	00:14:33	00:14:37	See for yourself.
233	00:14:37	00:14:38	I worked with Iona for several months.
234	00:14:38	00:14:43	She was making progress-- finally able to demand and receive affection.
235	00:14:43	00:14:46	So, I suggested she bring her boyfriend Carter to a session.
236	00:14:50	00:14:54	Carter, why don't you stroke the kitty's head, show her how beautiful she is?
237	00:15:03	00:15:04	It was a productive session.
238	00:15:05	00:15:07	Until the end.
239	00:15:09	00:15:11	Excellent. (meows)
240	00:15:11	00:15:14	Excellent. We'll pick this up next week.
241	00:15:16	00:15:19	The session's over.
242	00:15:20	00:15:22	Iona?
243	00:15:27	00:15:33	Iona, whatever you're hiding from in there, you have to come out and face it.
244	00:15:33	00:15:36	Come on, this is nuts.
245	00:15:36	00:15:38	Let's go. (hisses)
246	00:15:38	00:15:41	Let's go, Iona!
247	00:15:41	00:15:43	Ow! God... Babe?
248	00:15:43	00:15:47	That was the last time I saw Iona.
249	00:15:47	00:15:50	She never came back, never returned my calls.
250	00:15:50	00:15:53	If you'd like, I have her boyfriend's contact information.
251	00:15:53	00:15:55	I loved Iona.
252	00:15:55	00:15:56	You two lived together?
253	00:15:56	00:16:00	Till six weeks ago. Then she just took off.
254	00:16:00	00:16:03	I blame that Dr. Kessler. She used to be a dominatrix.
255	00:16:03	00:16:06	I mean, how the hell does a woman like that get a license?
256	00:16:10	00:16:13	Look, I know this could get me in trouble, but...
257	00:16:13	00:16:18	I wanted to help Iona, so... I busted into her place.
258	00:16:18	00:16:21	I didn't find her...
259	00:16:23	00:16:25	...but I found these.
260	00:16:26	00:16:28	Bondage thing or something.
261	00:16:28	00:16:33	That's what that shrink got her into-- I was gonna go down to her office and throw those in her face.
262	00:17:11	00:17:13	What a mess.
263	00:17:13	00:17:15	Looks like a man's belt.
264	00:17:16	00:17:19	I heard that Maria's mom didn't want to see the baby.
265	00:17:19	00:17:22	No. No, she didn't.
266	00:17:33	00:17:35	I got a computer here.
267	00:17:38	00:17:41	I may have just found the father, or part of him at least.
268	00:17:41	00:17:43	Tuxedo.
269	00:17:43	00:17:45	Homecoming King.
270	00:17:45	00:17:46	Probably went to school together.
271	00:17:46	00:17:48	Pregnant 17-year-old.
272	00:17:48	00:17:49	Clueless mom.
273	00:17:49	00:17:55	Manhandled before she died. And either she hung herself or whoever roughed her up wanted to make us think that.
274	00:18:08	00:18:10	What kind of language is that?
275	00:18:10	00:18:11	It's called Eleet Speak.
276	00:18:11	00:18:15	Text and e-mail language comprised primarily of acronyms and abbreviation.
277	00:18:15	00:18:19	I know LOL, LMAO, how to wink.
278	00:18:19	00:18:21	That's about it; I don't even know what this is.
279	00:18:21	00:18:23	Eh, youth culture, my friend.
280	00:18:23	00:18:28	It's definitely a heavy conversation going on here between Maria and Nculver12.
281	00:18:28	00:18:31	Culver could be the last name. First name could start with N.
282	00:18:31	00:18:36	Nculver12 was the last person to text Maria before she died, (chiming continues) and they keep coming in.
283	00:18:36	00:18:38	These are coming in as we speak? Yeah.
284	00:18:38	00:18:41	Well, what's LMIRL?
285	00:18:41	00:18:45	Let's meet in real life. KPC-- Keep parents clueless.
286	00:18:45	00:18:47	Meet in person. Keep parents clueless.
287	00:18:47	00:18:49	Could be the Homecoming King.
288	00:18:49	00:18:53	Well, one thing's for sure in the digital age-- every keystroke's permanent.
289	00:18:53	00:18:55	Give me a few hours with this, I'll give you her whole life.
290	00:18:55	00:18:58	Nculver12's a good place to start.
291	00:18:58	00:19:00	Ah, a little chamomile.
292	00:19:00	00:19:04	I imagine the sparks between you and Dr. Lady Heather were flying.
293	00:19:04	00:19:06	I'm sure you dominated. Do you have something for me?
294	00:19:06	00:19:08	Yes, um...
295	00:19:08	00:19:11	so, about your broken lion's tooth-- turns out that it's neither.
296	00:19:11	00:19:13	Not from a lion, not even a real tooth.
297	00:19:13	00:19:15	It's prosthetic and synthetic.
298	00:19:15	00:19:17	A fake tabby tooth?
299	00:19:17	00:19:24	Made with the same polymethacrylate formula used by all dentists, but this tooth featured specific feline characteristics.
300	00:19:24	00:19:26	Which sent me on the hunt for veterinary dentists.
301	00:19:26	00:19:31	And? It seems that there's only one Dental Dolittle in the Vegas area who's doing this kind of work.
302	00:19:31	00:19:34	Dr. Tyrell Neth. Summerlin.
303	00:19:47	00:19:48	Someone's having a party.
304	00:19:48	00:19:50	Well, they won't mind if we crash.
305	00:19:52	00:19:55	Good evening. May I help you?
306	00:19:55	00:19:57	Dr. Tyrell Neth?
307	00:19:57	00:19:58	Yes.
308	00:19:58	00:20:00	I'm CSI Langston, this is CSI Sidle.
309	00:20:00	00:20:02	We're from the Vegas Crime Lab.
310	00:20:02	00:20:05	We'd like to ask you a few questions about Iona Vail.
311	00:20:05	00:20:07	Certainly.
312	00:20:07	00:20:08	Can we come in?
313	00:20:10	00:20:11	By all means.
314	00:20:12	00:20:14	I hope you like animals.
315	00:21:04	00:21:05	Check out the braces.
316	00:21:05	00:21:09	They prevent any bipedal activity.
317	00:21:09	00:21:15	Oh, I assure you, what goes on here is all quite healthy and, for the lack of a better word...
318	00:21:15	00:21:17	natural.
319	00:21:17	00:21:18	How about consensual?
320	00:21:18	00:21:20	All the restraints are self-releasing.
321	00:21:20	00:21:22	My pets choose to be here.
322	00:21:22	00:21:24	Your pets?
323	00:21:24	00:21:26	My friends and I find comfort from their affection.
324	00:21:29	00:21:30	Your human pets.
325	00:21:30	00:21:36	The idea of animal transformation-- therianthropy-- is as ancient as mankind itself.
326	00:21:36	00:21:41	In native cultures, young males gain an animal spirit at puberty.
327	00:21:41	00:21:48	Often, the initiate must kill his spirit animal, consume it as a rite of passage.
328	00:21:48	00:21:56	Yes, I'm familiar with the concept, but my understanding of therianthropy is that it's fleeting, it's meant to be symbolic.
329	00:21:56	00:22:04	In many cultures, the notion of retaining the shape of the beast is seen as nothing less than a curse.
330	00:22:04	00:22:07	Cat got your tongue?
331	00:22:07	00:22:10	Maybe you could loosen it enough to tell us about Iona Vail.
332	00:22:10	00:22:11	Iona was a creature of habit.
333	00:22:11	00:22:18	When she wasn't curled up at the foot of my couch, she was outside... in the pine tree.
334	00:22:18	00:22:20	Iona was living here? As a cat?
335	00:22:20	00:22:22	For the past six weeks, yes.
336	00:22:22	00:22:24	And then what happened?
337	00:22:24	00:22:26	She ran away.
338	00:22:26	00:22:27	Total mystery.
339	00:22:27	00:22:29	Oh, I have a theory.
340	00:22:29	00:22:32	Life in the gilded cage wasn't everything that Iona hoped for.
341	00:22:32	00:22:36	There were constraints, demands, expectations.
342	00:22:36	00:22:38	Oh, I'm not intimate with my pets.
343	00:22:38	00:22:40	No? Then what do you get out of the relationship?
344	00:22:40	00:22:44	Affection, loyalty, gratitude.
345	00:22:44	00:22:47	Qualities I find sorely lacking in human society.
346	00:22:47	00:22:52	And this house, while certainly gilded, is no cage.
347	00:22:52	00:22:55	The animals can come and go as they please.
348	00:22:55	00:22:58	I have a warrant here, Dr. Neth...
349	00:22:58	00:23:03	that allows us to go where we please.
350	00:23:03	00:23:07	How does someone who runs a woman's shelter end up with a guy like Neth? Good question.
351	00:23:07	00:23:10	Looks like Iona's pine tree.
352	00:23:15	00:23:17	Gouge marks in the bark.
353	00:23:19	00:23:21	Human-sized disturbance in the needles.
354	00:23:21	00:23:23	I think she took a hard fall.
355	00:23:23	00:23:26	(hisses) ...right now! You get back in that house!
356	00:23:27	00:23:29	That would explain her compression fracture.
357	00:23:29	00:23:31	Neth's looking for a little affection.
358	00:23:31	00:23:36	Iona just wants to hang out in her tree, so Neth breaks out a stun gun.
359	00:23:36	00:23:38	He stuns her, drags her...
360	00:23:44	00:23:46	I think she left something behind.
361	00:23:49	00:23:51	Same color and material as her cat suit.
362	00:23:54	00:23:59	I wonder if Neth dumps all his ungrateful animals back into the wild.
363	00:23:59	00:24:00	(growling) Wow! Easy.
364	00:24:02	00:24:03	Really?
365	00:24:07	00:24:09	He's got the same burn marks we found on Iona.
366	00:24:15	00:24:16	Nathan Culver.
367	00:24:16	00:24:19	How well did you know Maria Diorio?
368	00:24:19	00:24:21	She's my girlfriend. Wasyour girlfriend.
369	00:24:21	00:24:27	Excuse me, are you bringing everyone in from the school, or just my kid? Just your kid.
370	00:24:27	00:24:28	Nathan, is this you?
371	00:24:29	00:24:31	Yeah, that's my son.
372	00:24:31	00:24:32	He's the Homecoming King.
373	00:24:32	00:24:33	He's also an honor student.
374	00:24:33	00:24:37	What can you tell us about these text messages?
375	00:24:37	00:24:40	LMIRL? KPC? What is that?
376	00:24:40	00:24:43	Let's meet in real life. Keep parents clueless.
377	00:24:43	00:24:47	Why would you want to have a meeting with her and keep your parents out of it?
378	00:24:47	00:24:49	Can I talk to you guys in private?
379	00:24:49	00:24:53	Nathan, you can tell these officers and me exactly what the deal is with you and this girl.
380	00:24:56	00:24:57	I got her pregnant.
381	00:24:58	00:25:01	We... we hid it from everyone.
382	00:25:01	00:25:03	She was gonna have my baby in a couple of weeks.
383	00:25:05	00:25:07	Nathan, are you kidding me?!
384	00:25:07	00:25:13	You just had to keep your nose clean for one more year, get that scholarship and then you had it made, son.
385	00:25:13	00:25:18	And what, you're telling me that, uh, this girl and her baby-- they're dead?
386	00:25:18	00:25:20	The baby's not dead. The baby's in the hospital.
387	00:25:20	00:25:22	And that's lucky for you, Nate.
388	00:25:22	00:25:24	Otherwise, you'd be on the hook for a double homicide.
389	00:25:24	00:25:26	Homicide? Yeah, homicide.
390	00:25:26	00:25:29	I would never hurt Maria. We loved each other.
391	00:25:32	00:25:35	Is that your belt? Yeah, it's my belt.
392	00:25:35	00:25:37	I left it at Maria's a while ago.
393	00:25:38	00:25:40	What can you tell me about those bruises?
394	00:25:42	00:25:45	Were you at Maria's house this morning?
395	00:25:45	00:25:46	Yeah.
396	00:25:47	00:25:50	I came over after her mom left for work.
397	00:25:50	00:25:52	You said you wanted the baby.
398	00:25:52	00:25:55	You were going to take care of me. You promised.
399	00:25:55	00:25:58	I know. I'm sorry, all right? But think about it, Maria.
400	00:25:58	00:26:00	It's only gonna ruin our lives.
401	00:26:00	00:26:02	I'm not going to get my scholarship.
402	00:26:02	00:26:04	And without it, I can't afford to go to college.
403	00:26:04	00:26:06	Why didn't you tell me this eight and a half months ago?
404	00:26:06	00:26:09	I'm keeping the baby! No, you're not!
405	00:26:09	00:26:10	Ow! You're hurting me. I don't want it!
406	00:26:10	00:26:11	So you did grab her.
407	00:26:11	00:26:16	Then what were you gonna do? String her up with the belt and try to make it look like a suicide?
408	00:26:16	00:26:18	No! We had a fight and I left. I went to school.
409	00:26:18	00:26:20	Ask anyone in first period. Enough!
410	00:26:20	00:26:22	We know you were in your room when she hung herself.
411	00:26:22	00:26:25	You admitted that's your belt, and we know you were grabbing on her.
412	00:26:25	00:26:30	Grabbing, belt, sex, baby, scholarship-- motive.
413	00:26:30	00:26:32	You see what this looks like?
414	00:26:32	00:26:34	Nathan, scholarship land's over, dude.
415	00:26:34	00:26:37	You're on the hook for murder here.
416	00:26:37	00:26:42	Now, if you didn't kill her, you better damn sure help us find out who did, you hear me?
417	00:26:43	00:26:45	So, who else would want to hurt her?
418	00:26:50	00:26:52	Everyone.
419	00:26:56	00:26:59	Maria received over a thousand e-mails just today, and twice that by text.
420	00:26:59	00:27:01	They've been coming in for months.
421	00:27:01	00:27:04	She tried to delete them all, and just couldn't keep up.
422	00:27:04	00:27:09	So, I tracked the cyber footprints on her devices, and it led me to this.
423	00:27:09	00:27:11	Hate mail was just the beginning.
424	00:27:11	00:27:15	MariaIsABitch.com. What, a hate site?
425	00:27:15	00:27:17	Yeah. Check this out.
426	00:27:18	00:27:20	I'm a slut!
427	00:27:20	00:27:22	I'm a ho.
428	00:27:22	00:27:24	What does that spell?
429	00:27:24	00:27:26	W-H-O-R-E!
430	00:27:26	00:27:28	Turn it off. I've seen enough.
431	00:27:28	00:27:30	Maria went viral with a click of a button.
432	00:27:30	00:27:33	We're talking 11 million hits in 18 hours.
433	00:27:33	00:27:36	She's been getting a constant flow of messages via text and e-mail.
434	00:27:36	00:27:38	From all over the world? Mm-hmm.
435	00:27:38	00:27:41	It's the power of the world wide web. (e-mail chiming)
436	00:27:41	00:27:43	She's been dead a day.
437	00:27:43	00:27:49	She's still getting messages. You know, Conrad, even if the evidence tells me this girl took her own life, I still consider this to be murder.
438	00:27:49	00:27:51	Well, how do you figure that, Nick?
439	00:27:51	00:27:54	She was bullied. Yeah. Cyber-bullied.
440	00:27:54	00:27:58	Look, it's not like back in the days of getting your lunch money stolen, or getting tripped in the hallway.
441	00:27:58	00:28:03	11 million people bombarded this girl with hate, and it drove her to take her own life.
442	00:28:03	00:28:05	What do you want to do? These people are on line, Nick.
443	00:28:05	00:28:07	We're not going to get 11 million arrest warrants.
444	00:28:07	00:28:12	I know that, Conrad, but I do feel like some of the kids at this school are responsible, and I want to pursue that.
445	00:28:12	00:28:16	Listen, you weren't there when Robbins delivered that baby.
446	00:28:16	00:28:20	Maria and her child deserve some justice, and we're obligated to give it to her.
447	00:28:20	00:28:23	Okay, but like anything forensic, I need proof.
448	00:28:23	00:28:26	We know how it ended, but how did it start?
449	00:28:26	00:28:33	Get me names, and prove to me that an honor student, soon-to-be father, didn't kill Maria Diorio with his own belt.
450	00:28:33	00:28:35	Do that and I will go to bat for you.
451	00:28:35	00:28:36	All right.
452	00:28:38	00:28:40	Every keystroke's permanent, right? Right.
453	00:28:40	00:28:42	Give me all the hate mail linked to that high school.
454	00:28:45	00:28:46	Hey. Hey.
455	00:28:46	00:28:48	Did you go home for lunch?
456	00:28:48	00:28:53	No. I went over to the NIC Unit to visit our baby girl. Oh,yeah? How's she doing?
457	00:28:53	00:28:55	She's off the respirator, breathing on her own now.
458	00:28:55	00:28:57	Good.
459	00:28:57	00:28:58	Nurse told me I was her only visitor.
460	00:29:01	00:29:03	Did you have a chance to work out a timeline yet?
461	00:29:03	00:29:04	Yeah, I just finished.
462	00:29:04	00:29:08	30 a.m.
463	00:29:08	00:29:10	Baby was alive. That puts T.O.D.
464	00:29:10	00:29:12	no more than 15 minutes earlier.
465	00:29:12	00:29:21	Okay, Brass confirmed that Nathan Culver was at school 30, so the only way he could've killed Maria is if he strung her up with his own belt sometime before that.
466	00:29:21	00:29:25	Could it have taken her 45 minutes to die?
467	00:29:25	00:29:30	Given the absence of ligature marks around her neck-- impossible.
468	00:29:30	00:29:32	Nathan didn't kill her.
469	00:29:32	00:29:36	I just spent an hour talking to a man who think he's a dog.
470	00:29:36	00:29:38	You ask the man a question, he barks back at you.
471	00:29:38	00:29:42	A year ago, this guy was the manager of a hot dog chain.
472	00:29:42	00:29:45	And what conclusion do you draw from that?
473	00:29:45	00:29:49	Well, either he's hiding behind his animal mask, or Neth has got him brainwashed.
474	00:29:49	00:29:51	I think that might be a little simplistic, Doctor.
475	00:29:51	00:29:55	All your assumptions are based on one false premise.
476	00:29:55	00:29:56	Which is?
477	00:29:56	00:29:58	You attribute all the power to Neth.
478	00:29:58	00:29:59	He is the master.
479	00:29:59	00:30:00	It is his house.
480	00:30:00	00:30:01	They are his pets.
481	00:30:01	00:30:02	His rules.
482	00:30:02	00:30:04	But a king is nothing without his subjects.
483	00:30:04	00:30:06	They define him, elevate him.
484	00:30:06	00:30:09	Without them, he's just a man.
485	00:30:13	00:30:15	You're saying that the relationship is more equal than it seems?
486	00:30:15	00:30:18	It's a bond of reciprocity.
487	00:30:18	00:30:20	Tyrell gets affection, his pets get shelter.
488	00:30:20	00:30:27	It's like the bond between dominant and submissive, hunter and hunted.
489	00:30:31	00:30:32	I watch the news, Doctor.
490	00:30:32	00:30:36	I even read the transcripts of your trial.
491	00:30:36	00:30:40	Who do you think Nate Haskell was performing for in that courtroom?
492	00:30:40	00:30:44	It wasn't the judge or the jury.
493	00:30:44	00:30:46	I can help.
494	00:30:46	00:30:50	No, thank you, Dr. Kessler.
495	00:30:50	00:30:53	You've answered my questions.
496	00:30:53	00:30:55	Then I guess we're done here.
497	00:30:58	00:31:00	For now.
498	00:31:07	00:31:09	Hey, Dr. Ray.
499	00:31:09	00:31:14	I was searching Neth's stables. Aside from a few human ponies, guess what I found.
500	00:31:14	00:31:16	Our smoking stun gun.
501	00:31:59	00:32:09	This itty-bitty piece of cat suit that you recovered from the sprinkler head on Neth's property was a no-go for trace, but a go-go for something very interesting.
502	00:32:16	00:32:17	Ridge detail.
503	00:32:17	00:32:18	Could be our killer's.
504	00:32:18	00:32:22	I went on a shopping spree, and I found just what I was looking for.
505	00:32:22	00:32:24	That's a lovely use of your personal time.
506	00:32:24	00:32:25	(zapping) Hey!
507	00:32:25	00:32:33	You'd be surprised how many models of stun guns there are out there. Iona and the Doberman were burnt with the same type of stun gun, but it wasn't Neth's.
508	00:32:33	00:32:35	His had a width of five centimeters.
509	00:32:35	00:32:41	The burns were consistent with this-- it's a PXY-2300-- which has a width of four centimeters.
510	00:32:41	00:32:43	Only two retail outlets make this model.
511	00:32:43	00:32:46	Iona purchased one last year, and she registered it with the manufacturer.
512	00:32:46	00:32:48	She was attacked with her own stun gun?
513	00:32:48	00:32:50	Maybe she bought it for protection at work.
514	00:32:50	00:32:51	Or closer to home.
515	00:32:51	00:32:54	I don't think her boyfriend was too happy about her moving out.
516	00:32:56	00:32:57	Let's see if he put his hands on her.
517	00:33:27	00:33:38	You know, the Iona who started the shelter, who saved me from my husband, she would have died before she let herself be some pervert's cat.
518	00:33:38	00:33:41	So I was just trying to bring her back.
519	00:33:41	00:33:46	So you subdued her with her own stun gun, threw her into a car, and then beat her up.
520	00:33:46	00:33:48	I had to get her out of there.
521	00:33:48	00:33:50	I mean, it was for her own good!
522	00:33:50	00:33:56	Usually, when people say they're doing something for the good of others, that usually means they're doing it for themselves.
523	00:34:01	00:34:02	Iona!
524	00:34:02	00:34:04	It was like she had been brainwashed.
525	00:34:04	00:34:06	Iona, come on!
526	00:34:06	00:34:08	I'm here to help you.
527	00:34:09	00:34:10	Iona!
528	00:34:18	00:34:21	I wanted her to be grateful.
529	00:34:21	00:34:24	I wanted her to cry in my arms.
530	00:34:24	00:34:29	I wanted to rescue her like she rescued me.
531	00:34:29	00:34:31	But she didn't want to be rescued.
532	00:34:33	00:34:35	Iona, what did they do to you?
533	00:34:35	00:34:38	(hisses) What is wrong with you?!
534	00:34:38	00:34:41	Stop it! I'm just trying to help you!
535	00:34:45	00:34:47	Iona!
536	00:34:47	00:34:51	If you really wanted to save her, Debra, why didn't you call 911?
537	00:34:51	00:34:53	I thought she was dead.
538	00:34:53	00:35:04	When you have lived in fear for so long, protecting yourself is all you could think about.
539	00:35:04	00:35:06	I'll tell you what I think.
540	00:35:06	00:35:10	Iona didn't want to be a cat forever.
541	00:35:10	00:35:12	She just wanted to be treated like one for a little while.
542	00:35:12	00:35:16	She wanted to be taken care of the way she had taken care of so many other people.
543	00:35:16	00:35:20	So why didn't she just say that?
544	00:35:20	00:35:23	Some people...
545	00:35:23	00:35:26	just can't ask for help.
546	00:35:29	00:35:30	They don't know how.
547	00:35:36	00:35:40	I can tell you about the events leading up to Maria's death without even having to talk to anybody.
548	00:35:40	00:35:42	All started eight-and-a-half months ago.
549	00:35:42	00:35:45	That's right around the same time Maria started seeing Nathan Culver.
550	00:35:45	00:35:46	Well, it all started with Nathan.
551	00:35:46	00:35:48	He was dating a homecoming queen.
552	00:35:48	00:35:50	Then, one day, he sees Maria.
553	00:35:52	00:35:55	For homecoming, we should coordinate our colors so we match.
554	00:35:57	00:35:59	What are you looking at?!
555	00:35:59	00:36:03	A couple days later, asks for her number, texts a bunch of I'm thinking about you's.
556	00:36:03	00:36:07	Next thing you know, Nathan dumps the homecoming queen by SMS...
557	00:36:07	00:36:10	one week before the big dance.
558	00:36:10	00:36:11	Cathy Mackey.
559	00:36:11	00:36:14	Now, Cathy and her two BFFs don't like that too much.
560	00:36:14	00:36:17	Popular girls, cheerleaders, I see where this is going.
561	00:36:17	00:36:20	All three of them had some pretty nasty things to say to Maria.
562	00:36:20	00:36:22	But it didn't stop there.
563	00:36:22	00:36:26	And that's how Maria's cheerleading tryout video got uploaded.
564	00:36:26	00:36:27	The girls had access.
565	00:36:27	00:36:29	I see where this is going, too.
566	00:36:29	00:36:31	It's a dogpile.
567	00:36:31	00:36:37	Not long after, the girls started doctoring up photos of Maria and circulating them around the school, which led to their suspension.
568	00:36:37	00:36:39	So the school knew this was going on.
569	00:36:39	00:36:43	According to Maria's e-mails, the principal found the photos offensive.
570	00:36:43	00:36:48	The girls were suspended, which led to their being ineligible for the national cheerleading competition.
571	00:36:48	00:36:50	I'm sure that didn't go over too well.
572	00:36:50	00:36:53	That's when the piling on escalated from a school level to a global level.
573	00:36:53	00:36:56	Texts and hate mails weren't enough.
574	00:36:56	00:36:58	They wanted to drive the knife deeper.
575	00:37:00	00:37:02	Watch this.
576	00:37:24	00:37:28	So the video goes viral, and Maria becomes a laughingstock.
577	00:37:28	00:37:33	Her father's dead, her mom's got her own thing going on, and she had no one else to turn to.
578	00:37:33	00:37:37	She's pregnant, and the boyfriend turns his back on her and the baby.
579	00:37:37	00:37:40	And she just broke.
580	00:37:43	00:37:45	...O-R-E...
581	00:37:45	00:37:47	What does that spell?
582	00:37:47	00:37:50	W-H-O-R-E!
583	00:37:50	00:37:51	Slut!
584	00:38:12	00:38:15	We might as well be staring at mug shots here.
585	00:38:15	00:38:17	These girls are the real killers.
586	00:38:17	00:38:21	It's so tragic what happened to Maria.
587	00:38:21	00:38:22	None of these girls are bad kids.
588	00:38:22	00:38:24	They're just kids.
589	00:38:24	00:38:28	Regardless, Ms. Johnson, they're responsible for the death of Maria Diorio.
590	00:38:28	00:38:30	It's time to teach these kidsa lesson.
591	00:38:30	00:38:33	You send hate, you go to jail.
592	00:39:16	00:39:17	I'm a father. I got kids.
593	00:39:17	00:39:20	Where were the parents during all this?
594	00:39:20	00:39:21	Probably working. Trying to get by.
595	00:39:21	00:39:26	Hoping that, eventually, one day, their kids will come up and talk to them, which never happens.
596	00:39:26	00:39:30	Well, whether the law agrees with me or not, I think the parents had a responsibility here.
597	00:39:30	00:39:32	I agree, but you want to talk about responsibility?
598	00:39:32	00:39:35	What about the 11 million people that watched a video that they shouldn't have?
599	00:39:35	00:39:37	What's the law gonna do about that?
600	00:39:37	00:39:40	Good question.
601	00:39:42	00:39:44	There's our girl right over there.
602	00:39:50	00:39:51	Is that her?
603	00:39:51	00:39:52	Right there.
604	00:39:56	00:39:58	I heard what you did.
605	00:39:58	00:40:00	Thank you.
606	00:40:00	00:40:02	You're welcome. You're welcome.
607	00:40:02	00:40:09	You know, it's not how you come into this world that counts, it's how you live it.
608	00:40:09	00:40:11	She's beautiful.
609	00:40:11	00:40:12	Congratulations.
610	00:40:18	00:40:20	What do you think, Nathan?
611	00:40:23	00:40:26	I'm scared.
612	00:40:26	00:40:28	I mean, I don't know the first thing about babies.
613	00:40:30	00:40:32	She'll let you know what she needs.
614	00:40:32	00:40:34	Come on.
615	00:40:34	00:40:36	Come on. It's all right, man.
616	00:40:39	00:40:46	Ladies, I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the crime lab.
617	00:40:46	00:40:51	This young man would like to hold his daughter, if that's all right.
618	00:40:51	00:40:54	Why don't you have a seat, Nathan?
619	00:40:54	00:40:55	Sit down right here.
620	00:41:11	00:41:15	You know, she kinda looks like you, man.
621	00:41:16	00:41:18	Have you thought of a name yet?
622	00:41:18	00:41:20	Yeah.
623	00:41:21	00:41:23	Maria.
624	00:41:23	00:41:25	That's a good one.
625	00:41:34	00:41:40	Every file on Nate Haskell dating back to 1996.
626	00:41:40	00:41:42	You said you were expecting me, Doctor.
627	00:41:42	00:41:45	Please don't tell me that you've changed your mind.
628	00:41:49	00:41:52	I don't know what you're fighting, Doctor, but it looks like you're about to be overrun.
629	00:41:56	00:42:05	Nate Haskell is an enemy, a formidable enemy, but he's not theenemy, is he?
630	00:42:15	00:42:26	When I went for, uh, my interview at med school, the first question they ask you, quite naturally, is, Why do you want to be a doctor?
631	00:42:26	00:42:31	Well, I can't remember the answer I prepared, but I remember the one I gave.
632	00:42:31	00:42:36	I told them, If I'm helping people, I'm not hurting them.
633	00:42:38	00:42:50	The guy stared at me for what seemed like a lifetime, then he burst out laughing, so I started laughing, and within a half an hour I had secured myself a place at medical school.
634	00:42:50	00:42:53	You had answered truthfully.
635	00:42:53	00:42:55	There's violence in me.
636	00:42:55	00:42:57	In my blood.
637	00:42:57	00:42:59	Sometimes I can taste it.
638	00:42:59	00:43:01	But as long as you keep a lid on it...
639	00:43:01	00:43:05	DNA is not destiny-- that's what I've always told myself.
640	00:43:05	00:43:08	I can't answer your question.
641	00:43:08	00:43:11	I didn't ask you a question.
642	00:43:11	00:43:13	Sure you did.
643	00:43:13	00:43:16	Why else did you come here, tell me that story?
644	00:43:16	00:43:19	Doctor, you want legitimacy.
645	00:43:19	00:43:23	You want to know that it's okay to lose the muzzle for a while.
646	00:43:28	00:43:33	the good Dr. Langston isn't going to catch Nate Haskell.
647	00:43:38	00:43:43	If I give in to my nature, I won't catch him...
648	00:43:46	00:43:48	I will kill him.
649	00:43:48	00:43:50	Yes, you will.
650	00:43:50	00:43:52	What becomes of me then?
