1	00:01:27	00:01:28	Ring any bells?
2	00:01:28	00:01:31	Rub-a-dub-dub, dead man in a tub.
3	00:01:31	00:01:39	Sleeping bag for easy cleanup open window so the stench alerts the neighbors...
4	00:01:41	00:01:43	It's Royce Harmon all over again.
5	00:01:46	00:01:48	What do you think?
6	00:01:48	00:01:50	Suicide note in the same place?
7	00:01:50	00:01:53	You tell me, Karnac.
8	00:02:03	00:02:05	Now that's weird.
9	00:02:05	00:02:08	Not weird. Intentional.
10	00:02:15	00:02:18	What kind of language is that? Swedish?
11	00:02:19	00:02:20	It's backward.
12	00:02:27	00:02:28	Would you excuse me a minute?
13	00:02:30	00:02:32	Sure... okay.
14	00:02:45	00:02:46	He okay in there?
15	00:02:46	00:02:49	Quincy wants to be alone.
16	00:02:49	00:02:52	We had a case like this three months ago a guy found dead in his bathtub.
17	00:02:52	00:02:55	Turned out the suicide was staged.
18	00:02:55	00:02:58	Found a mini-recorder as a suicide note.
19	00:02:58	00:03:00	Killer may have struck again.
20	00:03:00	00:03:01	Why does he want to be alone?
21	00:03:04	00:03:06	He wants to get his mojo working.
22	00:03:06	00:03:10	My name is Stuart Rampler.
23	00:03:10	00:03:15	I reside at 818 Boeing Hill Court Las Vegas, Nevada.
24	00:03:15	00:03:18	I am 43 years of age and I'm going to kill myself.
25	00:03:18	00:03:21	I just can't do it anymore.
26	00:03:21	00:03:24	I love you, Mom.
27	00:03:29	00:03:32	You're back.
28	00:04:07	00:04:09	Shibley, take this recorder to the print lab.
29	00:04:09	00:04:11	Have Mandy dust it and run prints on it right away.
30	00:04:12	00:04:13	Photos from tonight's suicide.
31	00:04:13	00:04:14	Put a rush on them for you.
32	00:04:14	00:04:16	Photos, thank you.
33	00:04:22	00:04:24	Oh...
34	00:04:24	00:04:25	Throw the flag, ref!
35	00:04:25	00:04:27	Uncatchable, bro.
36	00:04:28	00:04:32	Hey! you guys want an assignment slip or a pink slip?
37	00:04:32	00:04:35	I was just taking a little coffee break.
38	00:04:35	00:04:37	Is it true?
39	00:04:38	00:04:39	Same guy?
40	00:04:39	00:04:41	I don't know.
41	00:04:41	00:04:42	We'll see.
42	00:04:42	00:04:46	Here, 410 reckless driver out at Hoover Dam.
43	00:04:46	00:04:47	Car went over a cliff.
44	00:04:47	00:04:49	Anonymous caller.
45	00:04:49	00:04:51	Could be foul play.
46	00:04:53	00:04:55	Oh, me and him, working together?
47	00:04:55	00:04:56	Oh, it's on.
48	00:04:56	00:04:57	You're going down, bro.
49	00:04:58	00:05:01	Hey! Work together tonight.
50	00:05:01	00:05:03	All right?
51	00:05:07	00:05:09	Okay, we're going off the board tonight.
52	00:05:09	00:05:11	Off the board?
53	00:05:11	00:05:13	The ones that got away.
54	00:05:13	00:05:14	Fish.
55	00:05:14	00:05:15	Ah, I missed that one.
56	00:05:15	00:05:17	First victim, Royce Harmon.
57	00:05:17	00:05:23	About three months ago Brass and I found this guy dead in his own bathtub, but his suicide was staged.
58	00:05:23	00:05:25	I think the killer has killed again.
59	00:05:25	00:05:28	Photos of tonight's victim Stuart Rampler.
60	00:05:28	00:05:31	Play the pick six things that are different game.
61	00:05:31	00:05:32	Bet you lose.
62	00:05:32	00:05:33	This guy's good.
63	00:05:33	00:05:36	Not good. Exceptional.
64	00:05:36	00:05:42	Print Examiner lifted a thumbprint off the mini-recorder near the tub of our first victim.
65	00:05:43	00:05:45	The print came back this.
66	00:05:45	00:05:54	The killer purchased one of these rubber hands laced the fingertips with cooking spray and proceeded to place false prints all around the crime scene.
67	00:05:54	00:05:56	This guy is good.
68	00:05:57	00:05:58	Whose prints are these?
69	00:05:58	00:06:01	Some guy who works in a warehouse making Halloween paraphernalia.
70	00:06:01	00:06:05	Scary masks, air-brushed tombstones rubber hands.
71	00:06:05	00:06:06	He used his own hand for the mold.
72	00:06:06	00:06:07	So what do we do?
73	00:06:07	00:06:08	We split up.
74	00:06:08	00:06:09	You and I go to the coroner.
75	00:06:09	00:06:11	Sara, you go to the hotel.
76	00:06:11	00:06:13	Dust every inch of that bathroom.
77	00:06:13	00:06:15	Here, use this.
78	00:06:15	00:06:17	Red Creeper. My own concoction.
79	00:06:18	00:06:19	Wow.
80	00:06:20	00:06:22	Hmm-mm, serious case, serious print powder.
81	00:06:22	00:06:24	Be thorough.
82	00:06:24	00:06:25	Don't take anything for granted.
83	00:06:25	00:06:27	Yes, sir.
84	00:06:39	00:06:41	Everyone still breathing in that car?
85	00:06:41	00:06:43	So far.
86	00:06:43	00:06:44	Call came in blind.
87	00:06:44	00:06:46	You see who could have made it?
88	00:06:46	00:06:48	No, we were first on the scene.
89	00:06:49	00:06:52	Fire department came in two minutes behind.
90	00:06:52	00:06:56	Place was dead quiet.
91	00:07:02	00:07:04	Where's the driver?
92	00:07:04	00:07:05	He get thrown?
93	00:07:05	00:07:07	Didn't find anybody.
94	00:07:13	00:07:14	I'm thinking DUI.
95	00:07:14	00:07:16	You calling it?
96	00:07:18	00:07:22	I'm calling that beer bottle.
97	00:07:26	00:07:28	How do you know it's from the car?
98	00:07:32	00:07:34	It's still cold.
99	00:07:34	00:07:37	Foam in the bottle.
100	00:07:37	00:07:38	Take it up top?
101	00:07:38	00:07:41	After you...
102	00:07:43	00:07:48	I've read Klausbach's report on Royce Harmon the first staged suicide.
103	00:07:48	00:07:52	Similarities? Well, based on the entry wound, they were both murdered.
104	00:07:52	00:07:54	But here's where it gets fun.
105	00:07:56	00:07:57	He was shot trying to protect himself.
106	00:07:57	00:08:00	What else, Doc? My mind is painting.
107	00:08:00	00:08:04	He was paid a little visit from Mr. Muzzle Stamp.
108	00:08:06	00:08:08	Forced into the tub at gunpoint?
109	00:08:08	00:08:09	Okay.
110	00:08:09	00:08:12	Let's play it out.
111	00:08:12	00:08:15	The killer's got him at gunpoint, right?
112	00:08:15	00:08:18	Standing over him like this.
113	00:08:18	00:08:19	No!!
114	00:08:22	00:08:26	But this time, things got messy.
115	00:08:26	00:08:28	Royce Harmon didn't fight back.
116	00:08:28	00:08:31	That's why there was no muzzle bruising to his temple.
117	00:08:31	00:08:32	Stuart Rampler was resistant.
118	00:08:32	00:08:34	He didn't want to get into that tub too easily.
119	00:08:35	00:08:37	He took a few jabs to the temple.
120	00:08:37	00:08:39	But the killer just lost round one.
121	00:08:39	00:08:44	We know how he gets his vics into the tub and we know that both deaths were homicides.
122	00:08:44	00:08:45	It's not a bad start.
123	00:08:51	00:08:54	The skid started way up the road.
124	00:08:54	00:08:56	I got him doing at least 70.
125	00:08:56	00:08:59	More like 80.
126	00:08:59	00:09:02	These grooves are from the car's frame.
127	00:09:02	00:09:04	It balanced before it fell.
128	00:09:04	00:09:07	This is where he bailed.
129	00:09:07	00:09:13	Wide spacing, slipping of the heel.
130	00:09:13	00:09:15	He ran.
131	00:09:16	00:09:18	Who?
132	00:09:18	00:09:21	The phantom driver.
133	00:09:21	00:09:22	Hey, hand me another beer.
134	00:09:22	00:09:23	No, you've had enough.
135	00:09:25	00:09:26	( car horn blaring ) Hey, hey...!
136	00:09:45	00:09:50	So your drunk driver just got out and ran away?
137	00:09:50	00:09:51	Where to?
138	00:09:51	00:09:52	I don't know.
139	00:09:52	00:09:53	That's why we're up here.
140	00:09:53	00:09:55	But he left his buddy hanging out to dry.
141	00:09:55	00:09:56	I can tell you that.
142	00:09:56	00:10:00	Then how do you explain car number two?
143	00:10:00	00:10:03	Driver ran to this point, car picks him up.
144	00:10:03	00:10:05	Here are your tracks...
145	00:10:05	00:10:07	Probably took him to the hospital.
146	00:10:07	00:10:09	Not if we have these.
147	00:10:09	00:10:12	They're kind of out of place.
148	00:10:12	00:10:15	A walking stride up to the edge.
149	00:10:19	00:10:20	No.
150	00:10:24	00:10:26	This is a crime, not an accident.
151	00:10:28	00:10:31	You care to back that statement up?
152	00:10:32	00:10:34	My phantom driver against your criminal?
153	00:10:34	00:10:35	How much?
154	00:10:36	00:10:37	50.
155	00:10:37	00:10:40	I don't get out of bed for less than a bill.
156	00:10:49	00:10:50	Hey, Evans.
157	00:10:50	00:10:52	Hi.
158	00:10:52	00:10:56	Victim's name is Stuart Rampler.
159	00:10:56	00:11:01	Lives in town reserved a room for one night because his house was being fumigated.
160	00:11:01	00:11:03	Hmm.
161	00:11:03	00:11:04	Find anything unusual?
162	00:11:04	00:11:07	I bagged a couple of utility bills.
163	00:11:09	00:11:10	Ready for mail.
164	00:11:12	00:11:18	It's almost as if he wanted to take care of some unfinished business before he checked out.
165	00:11:18	00:11:20	Well, it's not likely.
166	00:11:20	00:11:22	His suicide was staged.
167	00:11:31	00:11:34	It's an upside-down stamp.
168	00:11:34	00:11:35	What does that mean?
169	00:11:35	00:11:37	I don't know.
170	00:11:44	00:11:47	Wow, this stuff rocks.
171	00:11:47	00:11:48	I love bathrooms.
172	00:11:52	00:11:55	Last time I printed a hotel bathroom I had over 1,000 prints.
173	00:11:59	00:12:02	Okay...
174	00:12:02	00:12:04	close the doors and hit the lights, Daddy-o.
175	00:12:32	00:12:34	He wiped it clean.
176	00:12:34	00:12:35	Yeah.
177	00:12:35	00:12:37	This guy's a real pro.
178	00:12:37	00:12:40	Not only did he wipe it clean, it's sterile.
179	00:12:50	00:12:52	I thought you were going to tell me that you caught him.
180	00:12:52	00:13:01	Mrs. Harmon, we believe that the person who did this to your son may have done it to someone else and we need your help.
181	00:13:02	00:13:03	Well, what can I do?
182	00:13:03	00:13:08	We talked to the second victim's girlfriend and played his suicide recording for her.
183	00:13:08	00:13:12	She confirmed that it was his voice.
184	00:13:12	00:13:16	But I already told you that the voice on that tape was not my son's.
185	00:13:16	00:13:19	I know. We just need to be absolutely certain.
186	00:13:19	00:13:24	Do you have a recording of your son's voice so that we could tie the killings together?
187	00:13:24	00:13:27	Anything, Mrs. Harmon-- a home movie?
188	00:13:27	00:13:29	A recorded message off your answering machine?
189	00:13:29	00:13:32	All I have are pictures.
190	00:13:32	00:13:34	I may have something.
191	00:13:34	00:13:40	Royce gave this to me for Mother's Day last year.
192	00:13:40	00:13:45	It's a talking frame.
193	00:13:45	00:13:49	It's all I have left.
194	00:13:49	00:13:51	Hey, Mom, it's Royce.
195	00:13:51	00:13:55	I know you're always complaining you don't hear my voice in the house anymore.
196	00:13:55	00:13:58	Well, now you can listen to it anytime you want.
197	00:13:58	00:13:59	I love you.
198	00:13:59	00:14:02	I love you, too.
199	00:14:04	00:14:06	Mr. Backseat going to make it?
200	00:14:06	00:14:08	The name's Walter Bangler. He'll live.
201	00:14:08	00:14:10	He well enough to talk?
202	00:14:10	00:14:12	Subdural hematoma, compound rib fractures...
203	00:14:13	00:14:15	All right, all right, I get the picture.
204	00:14:15	00:14:17	How long until we can see him?
205	00:14:17	00:14:20	I didn't say you couldn't see him.
206	00:14:20	00:14:23	He's sedated.
207	00:14:23	00:14:29	If you want to talk to him you're going to have to wait until he comes off his meds in about 12 to 24 hours.
208	00:14:38	00:14:41	Tan lines, no watch and no ring.
209	00:14:41	00:14:44	Check his personal effects.
210	00:14:54	00:14:58	That must have been one hell of a fall to knock his watch and his ring off...
211	00:14:58	00:15:01	and take his money.
212	00:15:04	00:15:05	So what do you say?
213	00:15:05	00:15:09	Do you want to up the stakes another hundred?
214	00:15:09	00:15:11	To what, a deuce?
215	00:15:11	00:15:15	Say my foul play against your phantom driver?
216	00:15:15	00:15:17	You bet.
217	00:15:18	00:15:20	Okay...
218	00:15:20	00:15:23	I've got Stuart Rampler's DNA profile ready.
219	00:15:23	00:15:27	All I need is something to compare it to.
220	00:15:27	00:15:28	Coming right up.
221	00:15:28	00:15:33	Let's see if we can find out who this licker is.
222	00:15:44	00:15:47	What do you got?
223	00:15:47	00:15:53	Well, according to the DNA Stuart Rampler licked the right-side-up stamps.
224	00:15:53	00:15:55	What about the envelope with the upside-down stamp?
225	00:15:55	00:15:57	Well, it came back unknown.
226	00:15:57	00:16:01	He's toying with us.
227	00:16:01	00:16:02	Who?
228	00:16:02	00:16:05	Anonymous.
229	00:16:10	00:16:13	Superglueing the entire car?
230	00:16:13	00:16:15	It's a little excessive, don't you think?
231	00:16:15	00:16:16	Hey, man, this is war.
232	00:16:16	00:16:22	You know, I checked with six different medical centers, and no phantom driver at any of them.
233	00:16:23	00:16:24	Minor setback.
234	00:16:24	00:16:25	How about the 911 call?
235	00:16:25	00:16:28	Las Vegas cell phone. PD's putting a name to it.
236	00:16:28	00:16:29	Good.
237	00:16:29	00:16:31	What's all this?
238	00:16:31	00:16:33	The car was rented from the airport three days ago.
239	00:16:33	00:16:34	To...?
240	00:16:34	00:16:36	Walter Bangler.
241	00:16:36	00:16:40	I figure Vegas vacation; side trip to Hoover Dam.
242	00:16:40	00:16:41	Makes sense.
243	00:16:41	00:16:42	Mm-hmm.
244	00:16:42	00:16:45	You find his watch and ring?
245	00:16:45	00:16:48	No.
246	00:16:49	00:16:51	My pockets are getting fat!
247	00:16:51	00:16:52	Well, he travels light.
248	00:16:52	00:16:55	There was only a change of clothes in the damn suitcase.
249	00:16:55	00:16:56	God, you see all that money in there?
250	00:16:56	00:16:59	All right, the fumes have settled. Give me a hand.
251	00:16:59	00:17:00	Yeah.
252	00:17:13	00:17:15	You can run...
253	00:17:17	00:17:19	but you can't hide.
254	00:17:21	00:17:23	Disco Placid-- what's that?
255	00:17:23	00:17:24	He's a jazz producer.
256	00:17:24	00:17:26	He specializes in audio.
257	00:17:26	00:17:28	He does voice comparisons for me from time to time.
258	00:17:28	00:17:29	He hears in perfect pitch.
259	00:17:29	00:17:30	Really?
260	00:17:30	00:17:32	He's gifted.
261	00:17:50	00:17:52	I'm sorry to hear that.
262	00:17:52	00:17:55	Oh, that's Bill Withers, man. The man cuts me up inside.
263	00:17:55	00:17:59	Catherine Willows, Disco Placid.
264	00:18:01	00:18:03	A pleasure. A pleasure.
265	00:18:06	00:18:08	How are we coming with our voice comparisons?
266	00:18:08	00:18:10	Got it right here.
267	00:18:10	00:18:13	All I got to do is, uh, heat this thing up.
268	00:18:17	00:18:21	It's a mini-cassette recording of your first victim.
269	00:18:21	00:18:24	I'm going to kill myself.
270	00:18:24	00:18:25	I'm comparing the I love yous...
271	00:18:25	00:18:30	I just can't do it anymore... I love you, Mom...
272	00:18:30	00:18:33	Now the talking frame.
273	00:18:33	00:18:39	Well, now you can listen to it anytime you want. I love you.
274	00:18:39	00:18:40	Minnesota Twins.
275	00:18:40	00:18:43	The mother was wrong. That is her son's voice.
276	00:18:43	00:18:49	I laid in both suicide notes in the computer, stripped the tracks one by one.
277	00:18:49	00:18:52	Picked this up in the b-ground.
278	00:18:52	00:18:56	My name is Royce Harmon.
279	00:18:56	00:19:00	I reside at 7642 Carpenter Street Las Vegas, Nevada.
280	00:19:00	00:19:01	I am 41 years of age.
281	00:19:02	00:19:04	What is that?
282	00:19:04	00:19:09	I don't know. It sounds like a flag or a tarp or something.
283	00:19:09	00:19:11	Give me a sec. I'll give it to you in a Chinese to-go box.
284	00:19:11	00:19:12	Play the second victim's tape.
285	00:19:13	00:19:16	Okay.
286	00:19:16	00:19:18	My name is Stuart Rampler.
287	00:19:18	00:19:21	I reside at 818 Boeing Hill Court, Las Vegas...
288	00:19:22	00:19:25	No. Play it through.
289	00:19:25	00:19:26	...Nevada.
290	00:19:27	00:19:30	I am 43 years of age, and I'm going to kill myself.
291	00:19:30	00:19:32	Play them side by side.
292	00:19:34	00:19:37	My name is Royce Harmon. Stuart Rampler.
293	00:19:37	00:19:39	I reside at 818 Boeing Hill 7642 Carpenter Street.
294	00:19:39	00:19:41	Las Vegas, Nevada.
295	00:19:41	00:19:43	I am 41/43 years of age.
296	00:19:43	00:19:45	It's fill in the blanks.
297	00:19:45	00:19:47	He's just reading from a suicide script.
298	00:19:50	00:19:52	What do you think?
299	00:19:52	00:19:55	Disco.
300	00:19:55	00:19:59	So I've got some good news and mysterious news.
301	00:19:59	00:20:00	Give me the good news.
302	00:20:00	00:20:05	Well, your results are back from the prints on the car and your vic Walter Bangler's top on the list.
303	00:20:05	00:20:07	It's a big list.
304	00:20:07	00:20:08	You fumed the entire car.
305	00:20:08	00:20:10	What'd you expect?
306	00:20:10	00:20:11	What's the mysterious news?
307	00:20:11	00:20:15	I found some speckles of blue dust in the ridges of Bangler's print.
308	00:20:15	00:20:16	Here. Look.
309	00:20:21	00:20:22	Let me see.
310	00:20:25	00:20:27	What do you think?
311	00:20:27	00:20:31	I have no idea.
312	00:20:31	00:20:36	I did some comparative digging on both victims-- Royce Harmon and Stuart Rampler.
313	00:20:36	00:20:41	Both are white males in their 40s, single and... both have the same birthday.
314	00:20:41	00:20:45	Royce Harmon, born August 17, 1958.
315	00:20:45	00:20:50	Stuart Rampler, born August 17, 1957.
316	00:20:50	00:20:52	One year apart.
317	00:20:53	00:20:56	Okay, so maybe it's some reversed or backwards pattern.
318	00:20:56	00:20:58	August 17, 1958...
319	00:20:58	00:21:03	1957. The suicide message was recorded backwards; the postage stamp was upside-down...
320	00:21:03	00:21:05	Yeah?
321	00:21:05	00:21:08	Maybe he's telling us in order to go forward, go back.
322	00:21:08	00:21:12	Sara, go back one more year-- August 17, 1956.
323	00:21:12	00:21:15	See if anything pops up with the same MO.
324	00:21:15	00:21:16	I'm gone.
325	00:21:19	00:21:23	Mr. Grissom, the prints are back from Stuart Rampler's mini-recorder.
326	00:21:26	00:21:27	Can we see the print?
327	00:21:28	00:21:29	Not print-- prints.
328	00:21:29	00:21:31	What do you mean-- It's more than one person?
329	00:21:31	00:21:33	It's two thumbprints overlapped.
330	00:21:33	00:21:34	Can you separate them?
331	00:21:34	00:21:35	Yeah.
332	00:21:36	00:21:41	Running both prints through AFIS.
333	00:21:48	00:21:50	How can that be?
334	00:21:50	00:21:53	Compliance?
335	00:21:53	00:21:55	Someone within the department?
336	00:22:02	00:22:03	What?
337	00:22:03	00:22:07	Uh, Catherine, can you excuse us for a moment?
338	00:22:07	00:22:09	I need to speak with Mr. Grissom in private.
339	00:22:09	00:22:13	Anything you have to say to me you can say to her.
340	00:22:13	00:22:17	Well, the top print came back Paul Millander.
341	00:22:17	00:22:18	I expected that.
342	00:22:18	00:22:20	He's the guy who makes the rubber hands.
343	00:22:20	00:22:21	I've already cleared him.
344	00:22:21	00:22:23	What about the compliance-- the bottom print?
345	00:22:24	00:22:25	It came back you.
346	00:22:28	00:22:30	It's Grissom's print?
347	00:22:33	00:22:35	Wait a minute.
348	00:22:35	00:22:37	Somebody got a hold of your prints.
349	00:22:37	00:22:38	How?
350	00:22:38	00:22:39	I wear gloves at every crime scene.
351	00:22:39	00:22:41	I was printed for the job. We all were.
352	00:22:41	00:22:43	Well, somebody's obviously making this personal.
353	00:22:43	00:22:51	They could've gotten your print from a glass that you touched at a restaurant or from a latex glove that you discarded and they turned inside out...
354	00:22:51	00:22:54	Oh, God...
355	00:22:56	00:22:57	I get it.
356	00:22:59	00:23:04	Whoever it is is telling me that he's got me under his thumb.
357	00:23:16	00:23:20	So... who's your phantom driver?
358	00:23:20	00:23:23	Possibly a cop from Philly.
359	00:23:23	00:23:27	Or a, a nurse from Omaha.
360	00:23:27	00:23:29	Don't forget the mail carrier from Nashville.
361	00:23:29	00:23:30	Man, it's a rental.
362	00:23:31	00:23:33	Those prints are probably older than you are.
363	00:23:33	00:23:34	Well, this is going nowhere.
364	00:23:34	00:23:35	You giving up?
365	00:23:35	00:23:37	No, no, no, no.
366	00:23:37	00:23:38	We're still on.
367	00:23:38	00:23:40	I may be stalled, but I'm not out.
368	00:23:41	00:23:42	You want to take it to three?
369	00:23:42	00:23:44	You want to take it to three?
370	00:23:47	00:23:49	You still think he was robbed?
371	00:23:49	00:23:52	Tan lines where his ring and watch used to be.
372	00:23:52	00:23:54	On vacation in Vegas, but no money in his wallet.
373	00:23:55	00:23:58	His face all bruised up before he took that cliffside tumble.
374	00:23:58	00:24:00	Damn right, I think he was robbed.
375	00:24:12	00:24:13	Are you all right, man?
376	00:24:14	00:24:15	Yeah...
377	00:24:15	00:24:17	Yeah, I guess so.
378	00:24:17	00:24:20	I want the ring, the watch and all your cash.
379	00:24:20	00:24:21	Okay, all right.
380	00:24:21	00:24:22	Come on...
381	00:24:22	00:24:23	All right, all right.
382	00:24:25	00:24:26	Now get your ass in the back.
383	00:24:26	00:24:28	What?
384	00:24:28	00:24:30	I said get your ass in the back!
385	00:24:34	00:24:35	Strap in.
386	00:24:35	00:24:36	Okay.
387	00:24:43	00:24:45	He lays in wait. He robs him.
388	00:24:45	00:24:49	He tries to kill him, but he lets him buckle in?
389	00:24:49	00:24:52	I don't think the robber expected Bangler to get drunk and go crash his car.
390	00:24:52	00:24:57	He probably freaked and put him in the back seat trying to fool me into thinking someone else was driving.
391	00:24:57	00:24:58	But he only fooled you.
392	00:25:01	00:25:02	What about the blue dust, Warrick?
393	00:25:02	00:25:03	What about it?
394	00:25:03	00:25:05	Don't you think it matters?
395	00:25:05	00:25:06	Maybe.
396	00:25:06	00:25:10	But there's other questions to answer first.
397	00:25:10	00:25:13	Okay, like?
398	00:25:13	00:25:15	Footprints and tire tracks.
399	00:25:15	00:25:17	I hate you.
400	00:25:17	00:25:18	You love me.
401	00:25:18	00:25:20	Who you kidding?
402	00:25:46	00:25:48	Mr. Millander?
403	00:25:48	00:25:51	Hey, it's the forensics guy.
404	00:25:51	00:25:55	I forgot your name. I-I'm sorry.
405	00:25:55	00:25:56	Gil Grissom.
406	00:25:56	00:25:57	Hi, Mr. Grissom.
407	00:25:57	00:25:58	It's been a couple of months.
408	00:25:58	00:26:00	How are you, sir?
409	00:26:00	00:26:01	I'm okay.
410	00:26:01	00:26:02	What are you making?
411	00:26:02	00:26:05	I-I-I call it...
412	00:26:06	00:26:08	Good versus Evil.
413	00:26:08	00:26:09	You like it?
414	00:26:09	00:26:13	Yeah, it reminds me of our supervisor on days.
415	00:26:13	00:26:18	So, what brings you down to my humble abode?
416	00:26:18	00:26:21	I have a couple of questions regarding that staged suicide.
417	00:26:21	00:26:23	Remember?
418	00:26:23	00:26:26	Yeah, how's that going?
419	00:26:26	00:26:28	Not too well.
420	00:26:30	00:26:34	Say, w-would you like a cup of coffee?
421	00:26:34	00:26:36	I got instant.
422	00:26:36	00:26:37	Sure.
423	00:26:48	00:26:51	I envy you, Mr. Millander.
424	00:26:51	00:26:53	I do.
425	00:26:53	00:26:57	You can work by yourself... no one around to bother you.
426	00:26:57	00:26:59	You just...
427	00:27:00	00:27:02	do what you do.
428	00:27:02	00:27:05	I'd love to have that kind of autonomy.
429	00:27:05	00:27:07	It's really all I know.
430	00:27:07	00:27:08	I...
431	00:27:09	00:27:13	started out doing ice carvings but the artwork never lasted.
432	00:27:15	00:27:16	I know what you mean.
433	00:27:16	00:27:17	Thank you.
434	00:27:18	00:27:20	Let's sit.
435	00:27:24	00:27:25	How can I help you?
436	00:27:25	00:27:30	Do you remember the, uh, rubber hand mold that you made from your own hand?
437	00:27:30	00:27:32	How could I forget?
438	00:27:32	00:27:36	Well, whoever the perpetrator is has killed again.
439	00:27:36	00:27:37	And again, your print came up.
440	00:27:37	00:27:39	So I was hoping you could help me.
441	00:27:40	00:27:41	Sure.
442	00:27:41	00:27:47	The last time we talked you told me that you had sold several thousand units last Halloween?
443	00:27:48	00:27:50	Bestseller, yes, sir.
444	00:27:50	00:27:53	Could you provide me with a list of your distributors?
445	00:27:53	00:27:57	I really don't have a list.
446	00:27:57	00:27:59	Why?
447	00:27:59	00:28:01	I was hoping to do a credit card search...
448	00:28:01	00:28:05	go back ten days before the first murder occurred...
449	00:28:05	00:28:08	try and run some names... see if any priors pop up.
450	00:28:08	00:28:13	I would really love to help you, Mr. Grissom, but...
451	00:28:13	00:28:19	I just don't keep track of, of individual purchasers.
452	00:28:19	00:28:22	I-I-I'm just a wholesaler.
453	00:28:22	00:28:25	I don't, I don't crunch numbers.
454	00:28:25	00:28:29	I-I just... spook the children.
455	00:28:29	00:28:32	Of course you do.
456	00:28:34	00:28:36	I'm sure you do it well.
457	00:28:42	00:28:44	Finally...
458	00:28:46	00:28:50	Hey, partner, did you get a match yet?
459	00:28:50	00:28:52	Ooh, Converse All-Star.
460	00:28:52	00:28:53	Size 11.
461	00:28:53	00:28:55	And you needed all the books for that?
462	00:28:55	00:28:58	Those soles have been around 20 years.
463	00:28:58	00:29:00	I needed to be sure.
464	00:29:00	00:29:01	You look tired, buddy.
465	00:29:01	00:29:03	You want me to make you a bottle, go nigh-nigh?
466	00:29:03	00:29:05	You want me to clack that jaw, make you go nigh-nigh?
467	00:29:05	00:29:07	You should have worked the tire tracks.
468	00:29:07	00:29:11	Jimmy in Trace put together a digital catalog of treads...
469	00:29:11	00:29:12	has thousands on file.
470	00:29:12	00:29:13	Took me three minutes.
471	00:29:16	00:29:19	Pirelli Low Profile P-Zeros.
472	00:29:19	00:29:20	High performance.
473	00:29:20	00:29:23	And standard on your alleged getaway vehicle...
474	00:29:24	00:29:26	the '99 Bentley Arnage, Red Label.
475	00:29:26	00:29:28	It's a sweet ride, man, hand-crafted.
476	00:29:28	00:29:32	So, how many people in Vegas do you think drive that kind of price tag?
477	00:29:32	00:29:34	Three.
478	00:29:34	00:29:35	Did a DMV search.
479	00:29:35	00:29:37	Any reported stolen?
480	00:29:37	00:29:38	Yeah, one, last week.
481	00:29:38	00:29:40	It came in a couple of hours ago.
482	00:29:40	00:29:41	Take a look.
483	00:29:42	00:29:44	Oh-ho!
484	00:29:44	00:29:46	So sweet!
485	00:29:49	00:29:51	Check this.
486	00:29:51	00:29:53	One-to-one says that's the car.
487	00:29:53	00:29:56	Yeah, well, don't bet the sub shop, Warrick.
488	00:29:56	00:29:58	That's all the evidence you'll get from the Bentley.
489	00:29:59	00:30:01	We found it at a car wash off Warm Springs.
490	00:30:01	00:30:02	It's been vacuumed...
491	00:30:02	00:30:03	detailed, the whole works.
492	00:30:04	00:30:05	It's cleaner than brand-new.
493	00:30:05	00:30:10	Well, I wish Bangler's rental car company were as considerate as your thief.
494	00:30:13	00:30:15	Dr. Livingston.
495	00:30:15	00:30:17	Your dead man is making cash withdrawals.
496	00:30:17	00:30:18	Which one?
497	00:30:18	00:30:20	The first victim or the second?
498	00:30:20	00:30:22	The second, Stuart Rampler.
499	00:30:22	00:30:23	The bank called.
500	00:30:23	00:30:27	His ATM card showed a couple of withdrawals after his time of death.
501	00:30:27	00:30:31	ATM machines take photographs every three seconds.
502	00:30:31	00:30:34	Maybe we can get a Kodak moment of this guy.
503	00:30:34	00:30:36	I want the machine here.
504	00:30:36	00:30:39	I want prints. I want film. I want everything.
505	00:30:39	00:30:41	The whole machine?
506	00:30:41	00:30:42	Yeah, the whole machine.
507	00:30:42	00:30:44	Okay.
508	00:31:01	00:31:04	You got his clothes?
509	00:31:04	00:31:05	That's right.
510	00:31:05	00:31:08	What are you doing? His laundry?
511	00:31:08	00:31:10	Something to compare our mystery blue dust to.
512	00:31:10	00:31:12	Ah.
513	00:31:12	00:31:15	So... what's the pot up to?
514	00:31:15	00:31:16	We don't bet on cases.
515	00:31:17	00:31:19	Ah, of course you don't.
516	00:31:19	00:31:21	So, who's winning?
517	00:31:21	00:31:24	I am. I am.
518	00:31:24	00:31:26	Fiends.
519	00:31:35	00:31:38	Your mystery dust is...
520	00:31:38	00:31:40	silicon blue dye.
521	00:31:40	00:31:43	What's that?
522	00:31:43	00:31:47	Pool cue chalk.
523	00:31:47	00:31:50	Bangler's shooting stick with the phantom driver...
524	00:31:50	00:31:52	tosses a few back... piles into the rental...
525	00:31:52	00:31:55	...I-93, Hoover Dam.
526	00:31:55	00:31:57	But don't drink and drive.
527	00:31:57	00:32:00	You might spill your drink... car skids...
528	00:32:00	00:32:01	bangs into the railing...
529	00:32:01	00:32:04	see-saws...
530	00:32:04	00:32:05	on the edge...
531	00:32:05	00:32:07	What does the driver do?
532	00:32:07	00:32:08	Man, he bails.
533	00:32:08	00:32:12	He leaves Bangler in the back seat to take the fall.
534	00:32:13	00:32:14	Literally.
535	00:32:20	00:32:23	all the bases are covered.
536	00:32:23	00:32:26	Victim, suspect, crime scene.
537	00:32:26	00:32:28	Like a laxative...
538	00:32:29	00:32:31	it works.
539	00:32:35	00:32:37	Bangler shooting stick, I'll give you that.
540	00:32:37	00:32:39	Burping bourbons, I'll give you that, too.
541	00:32:39	00:32:42	But he left solo.
542	00:32:42	00:32:46	A few miles down the road, Bentley thief flags him down...
543	00:32:48	00:32:49	spooks him into a skid...
544	00:32:49	00:32:50	boom, crash!
545	00:32:51	00:32:52	He's robbed...
546	00:32:52	00:32:54	forced into the back...
547	00:32:54	00:32:56	pushed over the edge.
548	00:33:00	00:33:03	With Bangler out of the way the thief gets in his stolen Bentley...
549	00:33:03	00:33:05	hightails it out of there.
550	00:33:05	00:33:06	No watch...
551	00:33:07	00:33:08	no rings, no cash...
552	00:33:08	00:33:14	stolen Bentley tire treads, Converse All-Star size 11...
553	00:33:14	00:33:17	all bases covered.
554	00:33:17	00:33:21	Victim, suspect, crime scene.
555	00:33:21	00:33:24	And like a canary... it sings.
556	00:33:29	00:33:32	You know, I hate to admit it...
557	00:33:33	00:33:35	but I like your theory.
558	00:33:35	00:33:36	It does work.
559	00:33:36	00:33:41	I was sitting here thinking the same thing about your phantom driver.
560	00:33:41	00:33:43	So, what do you think?
561	00:33:43	00:33:48	Can two solid theories, each backed by evidence both be correct?
562	00:33:55	00:33:57	Yeah, there's our guy...
563	00:34:12	00:34:14	Life...
564	00:34:14	00:34:16	like holding a dove.
565	00:34:16	00:34:21	You hold it too hard...
566	00:34:21	00:34:22	you kill it.
567	00:34:22	00:34:24	Hold it too soft...
568	00:34:24	00:34:25	...and it'll fly away.
569	00:34:30	00:34:32	Have we located this bum?
570	00:34:32	00:34:35	Brass's guys are looking for him.
571	00:34:35	00:34:40	Okay... significance of the flipping?
572	00:34:40	00:34:42	He's obviously making a point.
573	00:34:42	00:34:43	What does the dove symbolize? Peace.
574	00:34:44	00:34:47	But I don't think it's peace in terms of...
575	00:34:47	00:34:49	of human civility or unrest.
576	00:34:49	00:34:51	I think maybe it's peace of mind.
577	00:34:52	00:34:57	What do you have to attain to have peace of mind?
578	00:34:58	00:35:01	Justice.
579	00:35:04	00:35:08	I'm going to keep doing this over and over again until I get justice.
580	00:35:21	00:35:22	Hi.
581	00:35:22	00:35:23	How you doing? Hmm.
582	00:35:23	00:35:24	How'd you find him?
583	00:35:24	00:35:28	We canvassed a square-mile radius of the ATM machine.
584	00:35:28	00:35:31	Started throwing bums hamburgers out the window in a nice tight spiral.
585	00:35:31	00:35:34	He ratted him out in 20 minutes.
586	00:35:36	00:35:39	You want to tell him how you were approached?
587	00:35:39	00:35:42	You know, I think better when I eat.
588	00:35:42	00:35:43	No kidding?
589	00:35:43	00:35:46	Jim, call The Steak House at Circus.
590	00:35:46	00:35:47	Get this fellow a porterhouse.
591	00:35:50	00:35:52	How do you like it, medium rare or...
592	00:35:52	00:35:55	no, you look like a well-done kind of guy.
593	00:35:55	00:35:56	Rare.
594	00:36:06	00:36:08	Two minutes, understand?
595	00:36:08	00:36:10	That's all we'll need.
596	00:36:12	00:36:16	Hey, how are you feeling, Mr. Bangler?
597	00:36:16	00:36:19	Uh, better, I guess.
598	00:36:19	00:36:21	I understand last night was exciting, though.
599	00:36:21	00:36:23	Yeah. I'm going to come right out and say it.
600	00:36:23	00:36:25	What happened to you is not right.
601	00:36:25	00:36:28	The person responsible needs to be brought to justice.
602	00:36:28	00:36:29	You tell me who that person is.
603	00:36:29	00:36:31	Who was driving that car?
604	00:36:31	00:36:33	Who the hell are you guys?
605	00:36:33	00:36:35	I'm Warrick. I'm Nick.
606	00:36:35	00:36:36	I'm Nick Stokes.
607	00:36:36	00:36:37	This is Warrick Brown.
608	00:36:37	00:36:39	We're with Criminalistics.
609	00:36:39	00:36:41	We've been working your accident.
610	00:36:41	00:36:43	Actually, sir, I-I don't think it was an accident.
611	00:36:43	00:36:49	I think you were robbed and any information that you remember about your attacker would be very helpful.
612	00:36:49	00:36:50	I wasn't attacked.
613	00:36:52	00:36:54	I was drunk...
614	00:36:54	00:36:56	really drunk.
615	00:36:56	00:36:59	No way I should've been driving that car.
616	00:37:05	00:37:06	Yeah!
617	00:37:09	00:37:11	I guess that's enough for me.
618	00:37:11	00:37:12	Then it's time to pay up.
619	00:37:14	00:37:17	Looks like I'm a little short.
620	00:37:18	00:37:20	Hit him.
621	00:37:20	00:37:21	No, wait.
622	00:37:27	00:37:29	( horn honking ) Jeez!
623	00:37:47	00:37:49	You mean you got hustled?
624	00:37:50	00:37:51	I won the first game.
625	00:37:52	00:37:55	You climbed in the back seat yourself?
626	00:37:55	00:37:56	Yeah.
627	00:37:56	00:37:59	So buckling up... really did save your life.
628	00:37:59	00:38:01	You know that?
629	00:38:01	00:38:03	Yeah, I guess it did.
630	00:38:04	00:38:06	You get well, okay?
631	00:38:06	00:38:08	Glad we could help.
632	00:38:10	00:38:13	Well, the only thing we didn't factor in was his will to live.
633	00:38:13	00:38:19	And the Bentley thief, size 11-- he could've been at that crime scene anytime last week.
634	00:38:20	00:38:23	So we push on the bet?
635	00:38:23	00:38:24	No winner?
636	00:38:25	00:38:26	No loser.
637	00:38:31	00:38:32	406, burglary.
638	00:38:32	00:38:35	Double or nothing?
639	00:38:35	00:38:37	You're talking to the wrong guy.
640	00:38:42	00:38:45	Can we start again, please?
641	00:38:45	00:38:48	Now, how did this man approach you?
642	00:38:48	00:38:49	He walked up to me.
643	00:38:49	00:38:52	Told me he'd give me a hundred bucks if I flip some cards.
644	00:38:52	00:38:54	He pay you cash?
645	00:38:54	00:38:55	Mm-hmm. A hundred-dollar bill.
646	00:38:55	00:38:57	You still have it?
647	00:39:00	00:39:02	How tall was this man?
648	00:39:04	00:39:10	Was he... shorter or taller than Mr. Brass here?
649	00:39:13	00:39:14	A hair taller.
650	00:39:14	00:39:20	By a hair, do you mean the hair of a rabbit or the hair of grizzly bear?
651	00:39:20	00:39:23	Somewhere in the middle.
652	00:39:25	00:39:27	Okay.
653	00:39:27	00:39:29	Let's say he was 5'10.
654	00:39:29	00:39:32	What else do you remember about this man?
655	00:39:32	00:39:35	He had a narrow chin.
656	00:39:35	00:39:42	Uh... his eyes were blue deep-sea blue, you know?
657	00:39:42	00:39:48	Uh, jet-black hair Uh, Spock-like ears pointed nose, bushy eyebrows.
658	00:39:48	00:39:52	Sunken cheeks with a bad complexion, almost pockfaced.
659	00:39:54	00:40:02	Uh, thin as a soda cracker and his clothes were wrinkled, like, uh, he slept in them.
660	00:40:02	00:40:05	And when he spoke, he spoke with a...
661	00:40:05	00:40:07	Stutter.
662	00:40:08	00:40:09	Yeah.
663	00:40:10	00:40:12	Paul Millander.
664	00:40:14	00:40:16	He set me up.
665	00:40:18	00:40:19	Son of a bitch!
666	00:40:19	00:40:22	I had him and I let him go!
667	00:40:22	00:40:25	You ever make any rubber hands?
668	00:40:25	00:40:30	I sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween even used my own hand for the mold.
669	00:40:33	00:40:36	So when I picked up the hand he must've lifted my print.
670	00:40:36	00:40:42	Latex rubber surface, freshly dried paint a snip of scotch tape-- it wouldn't be that hard to lift and replant.
671	00:40:42	00:40:43	Sara, we'll be on headsets.
672	00:40:43	00:40:45	Run everything you can on Paul Millander.
673	00:40:45	00:40:48	Use Forenz-L use Nexis, search anything and everything.
674	00:40:48	00:40:51	I'll call the brigade.
675	00:40:51	00:40:55	Paul Millander.
676	00:41:00	00:41:02	Age 42, 5'11, male Caucasian.
677	00:41:02	00:41:05	Address not on file, no criminal record.
678	00:41:05	00:41:07	Keep looking.
679	00:41:10	00:41:13	Listen, check the business database.
680	00:41:13	00:41:16	Halloweird.
681	00:41:19	00:41:21	There's no listing, Grissom.
682	00:41:21	00:41:22	How can that be? I was just there.
683	00:41:22	00:41:24	Change databases.
684	00:41:24	00:41:27	Newspaper index, periodicals index, just keep trying.
685	00:41:27	00:41:30	I got something out of the newspaper index.
686	00:41:30	00:41:31	What is it?
687	00:41:31	00:41:35	Two hotel security guards exonerated in alleged 'staged' suicide.
688	00:41:35	00:41:37	Boy's testimony shaky.
689	00:41:37	00:41:50	Paul Millander, age ten, testified that he watched in the closet while his father, John was escorted by two hotel security guards into his own bathtub at gunpoint where he was found shot to death.
690	00:41:50	00:41:53	Official cause of death was ruled...
691	00:41:53	00:41:54	Suicide.
692	00:41:54	00:41:55	Check the date.
693	00:41:58	00:42:00	Catherine, you were right.
694	00:42:00	00:42:03	August 17, 1959 it's a pattern.
695	00:42:03	00:42:07	So he was killing men who were born on the same day that his father died.
696	00:42:40	00:42:42	All clear.
697	00:43:21	00:43:24	Blank. What's that mean?
698	00:43:26	00:43:29	We have nothing.
699	00:43:35	00:43:37	Mr. Grissom in?
700	00:43:37	00:43:39	No, he's out on assignment.
701	00:43:42	00:43:44	Do you want to leave him a message?
702	00:43:44	00:43:47	No. Just tell him a friend stopped by.
703	00:43:47	00:43:50	A friend?
704	00:43:50	00:43:51	A friend. He'll know.
