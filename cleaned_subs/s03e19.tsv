0	00:00:01	00:00:03	This won't help, don't you see?
1	00:00:03	00:00:04	After me, there'll be others.
2	00:00:04	00:00:07	You'll have to go on killing, on and on until they catch you.
3	00:00:07	00:00:09	I won't be the last; there'll be others after me.
4	00:00:10	00:00:13	You can't help yourself because you're mad, mad, mad!
5	00:00:15	00:00:16	No one will question you.
6	00:00:16	00:00:19	They'll say it's just another suicide. ( phone rings )
7	00:00:19	00:00:21	Hello? ( cell phone rings )
8	00:00:21	00:00:23	Hello?! ( ringing continues )
9	00:00:23	00:00:26	Shh!
10	00:00:28	00:00:29	Burgess!
11	00:00:29	00:00:32	Burgess! ( phone hangs up )
12	00:00:32	00:00:33	Burgess! ( ringing )
13	00:00:33	00:00:36	Burgess! ( glass shattering )
14	00:00:36	00:00:38	Excuse me, sir.
15	00:00:38	00:00:42	I'm going to have to ask you to turn the phone off.
16	00:00:42	00:00:43	Sir?
17	00:00:43	00:00:45	I'll have to...
18	00:00:49	00:00:53	Whoo! Theaters are like nightclubs; they should always keep the lights off.
19	00:00:53	00:00:56	This is the last art house left in Vegas.
20	00:00:56	00:01:02	I saw Baraka here, on a double bill with Koyaanisqatsi Was there anyone else here? Sure.
21	00:01:02	00:01:04	With you? No.
22	00:01:04	00:01:06	Thursday night is Noir Night.
23	00:01:06	00:01:12	The poor sap was slumped over like a sack of potatoes, oozing blood like a broken bottle of ketchup.
24	00:01:16	00:01:18	His name is Gus Sugarman.
25	00:01:19	00:01:21	Runs a dental practice in Henderson.
26	00:01:21	00:01:23	Cell phone went off three times during the movie.
27	00:01:23	00:01:26	So, the usher finally came over to shut him up.
28	00:01:26	00:01:28	Yeah, somebody beat him to it.
29	00:01:30	00:01:32	Single puncture wound to the base of the skull.
30	00:01:33	00:01:34	And nobody saw anything?
31	00:01:34	00:01:35	They were watching the movie.
32	00:01:35	00:01:37	Dark room. Loud music. Four exits.
33	00:01:37	00:01:40	Everybody looking the other way.
34	00:01:40	00:01:41	Professional killer?
35	00:01:41	00:01:44	Or a movie buff.
36	00:02:16	00:02:19	It was Build My Gallows High, with Robert Mitchum, 1947.
37	00:02:20	00:02:22	with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer.
38	00:02:22	00:02:24	And Kirk Douglas. Trust me, the book was Build My Gallows High.
39	00:02:24	00:02:27	Mr. Siskel, Mr. Ebert, may I have a cause of death, please?
40	00:02:27	00:02:31	Puncture wound is small. Not a knife.
41	00:02:31	00:02:40	Seems like it penetrated all the way to the brain stem, and there's some bruising around the mouth.
42	00:02:40	00:02:45	Well, the killer could have stood over him, placed his hand over his mouth, stabbed him in the back of the head.
43	00:02:45	00:02:47	Didn't Telly Savalas do that in The Dirty Dozen?
44	00:02:47	00:02:51	Anthony Quinn did it, too, in Guns of Navaronne. Right.
45	00:02:51	00:02:53	Well, what movie did you see this in?
46	00:02:55	00:02:57	Looks like somebody ripped something off his neck.
47	00:02:57	00:03:00	Small patterns; could have been a chain, maybe, huh?
48	00:03:00	00:03:02	Or necklace. Oh!
49	00:03:03	00:03:04	Butterfingers.
50	00:03:14	00:03:16	What'd you got?
51	00:03:16	00:03:19	Well, whoever called him didn't leave their number.
52	00:03:33	00:03:36	Hey!
53	00:03:36	00:03:39	I wasn't the only one who dropped something tonight.
54	00:03:39	00:03:43	I got a witness.
55	00:03:43	00:03:47	I only noticed 'cause she got up during the best part of the movie, right before the gunfight.
56	00:03:47	00:03:49	Is the gunfight loud?
57	00:03:49	00:03:51	Yeah. I mean it's not THX Surround-sound.
58	00:03:51	00:03:54	This was 1950 and mono optical track.
59	00:03:54	00:03:56	I like how loud this theater keeps it.
60	00:03:56	00:03:57	Perfect moment to do it.
61	00:03:57	00:03:59	Cover up any noise the victim might make.
62	00:03:59	00:04:01	You get a look at her?
63	00:04:01	00:04:09	I drove 40 minutes to see this flick; my eyes were on the screen, but, uh, she was tall, not old... a redhead.
64	00:04:09	00:04:10	Did she come back in?
65	00:04:10	00:04:11	No.
66	00:04:11	00:04:12	And, uh...
67	00:04:12	00:04:14	I-I don't see her here.
68	00:04:15	00:04:17	Did anyone see her coming into the lobby?
69	00:04:17	00:04:19	Well, Manager had left for the night.
70	00:04:19	00:04:21	The usher who found the body had left before we got here.
71	00:04:21	00:04:22	He had been smoking blunts.
72	00:04:22	00:04:24	He was afraid we were going to bust him for marijuana.
73	00:04:25	00:04:28	I'll be tweaking him when I call him for my statement.
74	00:04:28	00:04:33	If you ask me, anybody who leaves their phone on in a movie deserves to get stabbed in the head.
75	00:04:33	00:04:35	That's why nobody ask you.
76	00:04:37	00:04:39	Detective.
77	00:04:39	00:04:40	Guys ...
78	00:04:40	00:04:41	Who called it in?
79	00:04:41	00:04:43	Passing motorist heard gunshots.
80	00:04:43	00:04:46	First Officer did a drive up. Found the scene.
81	00:04:46	00:04:47	Called in the world.
82	00:04:47	00:04:49	I hope you brought extra supplies.
83	00:04:49	00:04:50	Why's that?
84	00:04:50	00:04:53	You're gonna be here awhile.
85	00:04:58	00:05:01	Looks like a war zone.
86	00:05:07	00:05:09	We got an I.D. on the body?
87	00:05:09	00:05:13	No cash, no ID, just a driver's permit.
88	00:05:13	00:05:14	Driver's permit.
89	00:05:14	00:05:16	What is he, 16?
90	00:05:16	00:05:17	Fifteen-and-a-half.
91	00:05:17	00:05:19	Timmy McCallum.
92	00:05:19	00:05:21	Coroner's on his way.
93	00:05:21	00:05:23	Tell them to watch their step.
94	00:05:23	00:05:25	There's casings and blood everywhere.
95	00:05:25	00:05:27	Divide and conquer.
96	00:05:27	00:05:28	Inside or outside?
97	00:05:28	00:05:29	Outside perimeter.
98	00:05:29	00:05:31	I'm Dennis Rodman.
99	00:05:31	00:05:34	I'll take everything below the knees.
100	00:05:34	00:05:39	Question is not what we're going to find on the murder weapon; question is what isn't on it.
101	00:05:39	00:05:41	The sticky substance?
102	00:05:41	00:05:42	Soda.
103	00:05:42	00:05:43	Yellow crumbs?
104	00:05:43	00:05:44	Popcorn.
105	00:05:44	00:05:45	Carpet fibers.
106	00:05:45	00:05:47	It wasn't the cleanest theater in the world.
107	00:05:47	00:05:49	I just want to match the blood to our victim.
108	00:05:49	00:05:51	And you want to know if there's a recoverable print.
109	00:05:51	00:05:52	Uh-huh.
110	00:05:53	00:05:55	You want to race?
111	00:05:55	00:05:56	What's the bet?
112	00:05:57	00:05:59	Hmm...
113	00:06:36	00:06:38	Is that our guy?
114	00:06:39	00:06:42	Phone Company unblocked all his private numbers for us.
115	00:06:42	00:06:43	They can do that now?
116	00:06:43	00:06:47	Yeah. On the left side of the screen are the outgoing calls.
117	00:06:47	00:06:50	On the right, the incoming.
118	00:06:50	00:06:52	What time did the movie start?
119	00:06:52	00:06:54	40.
120	00:06:54	00:06:57	38.
121	00:06:57	00:07:00	555-0110.
122	00:07:00	00:07:02	26 seconds.
123	00:07:02	00:07:04	That sounds like a no answer.
124	00:07:04	00:07:15	Yeah, but 555-0110 was the number 26, 11 Someone needed to talk to him pretty bad.
125	00:07:15	00:07:17	Yeah, well, he was already dead by then.
126	00:07:17	00:07:20	Dr. Robbins was that accurate with the TOD?
127	00:07:20	00:07:22	That's when the gunfire erupted.
128	00:07:22	00:07:23	There was gunfire?
129	00:07:23	00:07:25	In the movie.
130	00:07:25	00:07:27	I'll need an address for that number.
131	00:08:54	00:08:56	Hey, guys.
132	00:08:56	00:08:58	What do you make of this piece of bamboo?
133	00:08:58	00:08:59	I found it on the roof.
134	00:08:59	00:09:00	Bag it.
135	00:09:00	00:09:02	That's funny. Very funny.
136	00:09:09	00:09:11	Did you get the hole in the roof?
137	00:09:11	00:09:12	You find anything else up there?
138	00:09:12	00:09:14	No.
139	00:09:14	00:09:15	Got some shards of glass.
140	00:09:15	00:09:17	Clear in color.
141	00:09:18	00:09:24	Mixed with small pieces of black plastic.
142	00:09:25	00:09:27	You almost finished with that?
143	00:09:27	00:09:28	What's your count?
144	00:09:28	00:09:30	Yeah. 109 rods.
145	00:09:30	00:09:33	109 bullets?
146	00:09:33	00:09:37	How in the world do trajectories occur 15 to 20 feet off the ground?
147	00:09:37	00:09:38	Horizontally?
148	00:09:41	00:09:43	What the hell went on here?
149	00:09:49	00:09:49	Audrey Hilden?
150	00:09:49	00:09:51	Yes.
151	00:09:51	00:09:52	We're with the Crime Lab.
152	00:09:52	00:09:53	Do you know a Gus Sugarman?
153	00:09:55	00:09:58	Why don't you come inside. Please.
154	00:10:00	00:10:02	He was my dentist. That's terrible.
155	00:10:02	00:10:09	He'd asked me to go to the movies, and I said yes, but... it was a late show, and I had to get up early for work.
156	00:10:09	00:10:15	Well, we know that Dr. Sugarman called you at home two minutes before the movie started, and that you didn't pick up.
157	00:10:15	00:10:18	I was screening. I figured he'd get my message.
158	00:10:18	00:10:21	And why did you call him three times in a row, 40 minutes later?
159	00:10:21	00:10:23	I felt bad standing him up.
160	00:10:23	00:10:25	I called to apologize.
161	00:10:25	00:10:29	I figured I'd get his Voice Mail, but when I didn't, I tried again.
162	00:10:29	00:10:30	And you were here alone?
163	00:10:30	00:10:32	Yes.
164	00:10:32	00:10:33	Can anyone verify that?
165	00:10:33	00:10:35	Why?
166	00:10:40	00:10:42	Still screening?
167	00:10:57	00:10:59	Do you see a lot of movies at the Art House Theater?
168	00:10:59	00:11:01	Sure. I love old movies.
169	00:11:01	00:11:04	I see they recently had a Hitchcock Retrospective.
170	00:11:04	00:11:05	I prefer French New Wave.
171	00:11:05	00:11:08	If you'll excuse me now, I have to go to work.
172	00:11:08	00:11:10	We'll be in touch.
173	00:11:17	00:11:19	Geez, what was this kid, tortured?
174	00:11:19	00:11:21	Couple of fractured ribs.
175	00:11:21	00:11:23	Deep purple contusions of the presternal chest wall.
176	00:11:23	00:11:25	Each one around two inches in diameter.
177	00:11:25	00:11:27	I stopped counting around nine.
178	00:11:27	00:11:30	What do you think could've done this? Baseball bat?
179	00:11:30	00:11:33	It's hard to tell. Whatever it was, it had a great deal of velocity.
180	00:11:33	00:11:34	Yeah.
181	00:11:34	00:11:37	single gunshot to the chest.
182	00:11:37	00:11:38	No evidence of gunshot residue.
183	00:11:38	00:11:42	Shot from a distance. Yeah.
184	00:11:50	00:11:52	And at a downward angle...
185	00:11:52	00:11:54	It's, uh...
186	00:11:54	00:11:59	It's about 25 degrees.
187	00:11:59	00:12:00	He was shot from above.
188	00:12:04	00:12:06	Rooftop angle is 45 degrees.
189	00:12:06	00:12:08	This is 25 degrees?
190	00:12:10	00:12:11	It's impossible.
191	00:12:11	00:12:15	If that's the case, he was shot by somebody 10 to 15 feet tall.
192	00:12:15	00:12:17	What else you got?
193	00:12:17	00:12:23	Scabbing abrasions on the elbows, the back and kneecaps.
194	00:12:23	00:12:26	Looks to be harmless boys will be boys stuff.
195	00:12:26	00:12:30	There's nothing harmless about death.
196	00:12:34	00:12:36	Don't tell me-- Greg won the bet.
197	00:12:36	00:12:39	The blood on the screwdriver definitely belongs to your victim.
198	00:12:39	00:12:42	It was incredible how fast he got me back the results.
199	00:12:42	00:12:44	I don't know how he does it.
200	00:12:44	00:12:46	Now I got to wear this stupid thing all day.
201	00:12:46	00:12:49	Oh, look at him, hovering.
202	00:12:49	00:12:51	Making sure I still have it on.
203	00:12:51	00:12:54	Do us all a favor and get him out in the field, will you, Grissom?
204	00:12:54	00:12:55	He's going stir crazy in here.
205	00:12:55	00:12:57	Jaqui, do you have anything for us?
206	00:12:57	00:12:59	A palm print.
207	00:12:59	00:13:02	Oh, great. Let's, uh, go back to Audrey's and see if we have a match.
208	00:13:02	00:13:04	Not quite.
209	00:13:04	00:13:06	Look at the ridges.
210	00:13:06	00:13:09	Too consistent.
211	00:13:09	00:13:11	Looks like fine grain.
212	00:13:11	00:13:12	Leather.
213	00:13:13	00:13:14	Killer wore gloves.
214	00:13:14	00:13:15	Okay...
215	00:13:15	00:13:21	here's what's happening-- three months ago, Audrey Hilden filed a sexual malpractice suit against our Dr. Sugarman.
216	00:13:22	00:13:25	The suit claims that she was molested while she was under anesthesia.
217	00:13:25	00:13:27	And she was going on a date with this guy?
218	00:13:27	00:13:29	Yeah. Sugarman countersued.
219	00:13:29	00:13:32	He's represented by big-time attorneys, so she backed down.
220	00:13:32	00:13:34	Well, a screwdriver's cheaper than an attorney.
221	00:13:34	00:13:36	Yeah.
222	00:13:36	00:13:37	Well, uh, there's more.
223	00:13:37	00:13:40	Remember the usher who likes to smoke the chronic?
224	00:13:40	00:13:45	He claims he saw a redheaded woman make a phone call halfway through the movie, so I'm going to check it out.
225	00:13:45	00:13:48	Want to tag along?
226	00:13:51	00:13:52	This where the limbo party is?
227	00:13:53	00:13:54	Can I come in? Yeah.
228	00:13:54	00:13:57	Sorry, I don't let everyone in here.
229	00:13:57	00:13:59	Well, I've got your one-to-ones.
230	00:13:59	00:14:02	The tire treads, there's nothing specific here.
231	00:14:03	00:14:07	Bummer. But the shoe prints that you took, they look interesting.
232	00:14:07	00:14:10	It looks like five suspects walked in, and four ran out.
233	00:14:10	00:14:12	Four guilty people out there somewhere.
234	00:14:13	00:14:14	No doubt.
235	00:14:14	00:14:16	How's it coming with your big bamboo here?
236	00:14:16	00:14:20	Well, I have black lung from all the powder, and not a single print, nothing, nada.
237	00:14:20	00:14:21	You test for GSR?
238	00:14:21	00:14:24	The place was riddled with bullets-- it wouldn't hurt.
239	00:14:24	00:14:25	Wouldn't hurt.
240	00:14:40	00:14:42	Nothing.
241	00:14:42	00:14:44	Maybe this has nothing to do with the case.
242	00:14:44	00:14:46	Maybe it was just a piece of debris left at the scene.
243	00:14:46	00:14:49	No, no. I-I'm not quitting. No.
244	00:14:49	00:14:52	I am in too deep.
245	00:14:55	00:14:57	Where you going? Trace.
246	00:14:58	00:14:59	Maybe Hodges can find something.
247	00:14:59	00:15:01	Oh, coming through. Careful, people.
248	00:15:01	00:15:03	Easy.
249	00:15:03	00:15:04	Hey, Brown. PD called.
250	00:15:04	00:15:05	Mrs. McCallum's there.
251	00:15:06	00:15:08	The mother.
252	00:15:08	00:15:10	Tell them I'm on my way.
253	00:15:14	00:15:16	I was getting myself a soda.
254	00:15:16	00:15:18	You know, we're allowed to do that.
255	00:15:18	00:15:24	A tall redhead came out of the theater, and then she made a phone call from over there.
256	00:15:30	00:15:32	From the pay phone.
257	00:15:32	00:15:34	What? I... What? I'm on it. I'm on it.
258	00:15:34	00:15:36	Did you happen to notice if she was wearing gloves?
259	00:15:36	00:15:38	Yeah, she was, actually.
260	00:15:38	00:15:42	I thought it was really weird, 'cause it's, like, 70 degrees in here.
261	00:15:43	00:15:44	Did you notice anything else?
262	00:15:44	00:15:49	No. She just threw something in the trash and headed out.
263	00:15:57	00:15:59	The cleaning crew's in the theater now.
264	00:15:59	00:16:02	They got a late start 'cause of you guys.
265	00:16:11	00:16:13	Excuse me.
266	00:16:14	00:16:16	What happened to the garbage that was in the can in the lobby?
267	00:16:16	00:16:20	Well, it's already been bagged up, but it should be around here somewhere.
268	00:16:20	00:16:23	Excuse me. Where'd you get those gloves?
269	00:16:23	00:16:25	If it's garbage, it's hers.
270	00:16:25	00:16:29	They let us keep whatever we find as long as it's been thrown out.
271	00:16:29	00:16:34	I'll tell you what-- I'll buy you a new pair of gloves.
272	00:16:46	00:16:48	Whatever happened to Take one down, pass it around?
273	00:16:48	00:16:49	That's the best part.
274	00:16:49	00:16:52	You know us lab rats have to do something to get through the day.
275	00:16:52	00:16:55	I know, I just dumped a sack of bullets on Bobby Dawson.
276	00:16:55	00:16:57	So, why don't you sing me a tune I want to hear?
277	00:16:57	00:17:00	Well... how about...
278	00:17:00	00:17:02	Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.
279	00:17:02	00:17:04	He ain't heavy.
280	00:17:04	00:17:07	He's my brother.
281	00:17:07	00:17:10	DNA? From the beer bottles?
282	00:17:10	00:17:12	Five different donors-- two of them are related.
283	00:17:12	00:17:18	Donor number one, Tim McCallum, the victim; donor number two, his relative, most likely a brother.
284	00:17:18	00:17:20	No telling if he's heavy or not.
285	00:17:20	00:17:23	I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. McCallum.
286	00:17:26	00:17:28	Are you Timmy's brother?
287	00:17:28	00:17:30	Yeah.
288	00:17:30	00:17:33	Kevin's the only son I have left.
289	00:17:33	00:17:39	We were able to identify Timmy by the driver's permit that we found at the scene.
290	00:17:39	00:17:41	Had he been driving long?
291	00:17:41	00:17:42	A few months.
292	00:17:42	00:17:48	I know that law says you're supposed to have an adult present, but I work graveyard.
293	00:17:49	00:17:51	Kevin usually drives with him.
294	00:17:51	00:17:54	What kind of car does Timmy drive?
295	00:17:54	00:17:55	We have a mini-van.
296	00:17:55	00:17:59	It's more safe.
297	00:17:59	00:18:03	This is an ongoing investigation, so we are going to need to see that vehicle.
298	00:18:05	00:18:07	Do you ever drive the mini-van, Kevin?
299	00:18:07	00:18:10	Sometimes, yeah.
300	00:18:10	00:18:12	Did you drive Timmy to the warehouse the other night?
301	00:18:12	00:18:13	No.
302	00:18:13	00:18:14	What warehouse?
303	00:18:14	00:18:19	We have reason to believe that Kevin was at the warehouse that night.
304	00:18:20	00:18:22	We found his DNA on some beer bottles.
305	00:18:24	00:18:25	Beer?
306	00:18:25	00:18:26	Kevin...
307	00:18:26	00:18:29	Mom... I bought beer for Timmy.
308	00:18:30	00:18:31	I don't do it all the time.
309	00:18:31	00:18:33	He begged me.
310	00:18:33	00:18:37	He... he said he was going out partying with some friends.
311	00:18:37	00:18:39	If Mom catches you with these, you didn't get them from me.
312	00:18:39	00:18:41	Bro, there's one missing.
313	00:18:41	00:18:44	I got thirsty. Later, freak.
314	00:18:46	00:18:49	I took a sip-- I gave him the rest of the 12-pack.
315	00:18:51	00:18:53	Sorry, Mom.
316	00:18:53	00:18:56	Mr. Brown, I don't know what to say.
317	00:18:56	00:19:03	I'm a single mother... I work nights, and you can't keep your eyes on your kids all the time.
318	00:19:03	00:19:08	At a certain age, you just have to trust them.
319	00:19:08	00:19:10	I understand.
320	00:19:10	00:19:15	We are going to need to keep Kevin here to ask him some more questions about that night.
321	00:19:15	00:19:17	Do you object?
322	00:19:18	00:19:20	N-No.
323	00:19:23	00:19:26	Spiral gouges.
324	00:19:26	00:19:27	Check it out.
325	00:19:32	00:19:34	From tip to tip.
326	00:19:34	00:19:36	What do you think caused these marks?
327	00:19:36	00:19:39	Give me more time-- I'm not a miracle worker.
328	00:19:39	00:19:40	Well, that's obvious, Hodges.
329	00:19:41	00:19:43	If you were a miracle worker, you wouldn't be rude.
330	00:19:43	00:19:45	I wasn't being rude, I was being curt.
331	00:19:45	00:19:47	Rude would be, When I know, you'll know.
332	00:19:47	00:19:48	Friends?
333	00:19:48	00:19:49	No.
334	00:19:49	00:19:52	Hodges, how's it coming with that glass?
335	00:19:54	00:19:57	Looks like there's some kind of coating on it.
336	00:19:57	00:20:00	More specifically, crystallized calcium fluoride.
337	00:20:00	00:20:02	You ran it through the I.R.?
338	00:20:02	00:20:04	Please. I.R. says fluorspar.
339	00:20:04	00:20:07	I say high-end optics.
340	00:20:07	00:20:08	Camera lens.
341	00:20:08	00:20:10	You think someone has this murder on tape?
342	00:20:10	00:20:17	So, the gloves match the palm print on the murder weapon as well as the pay phone in the theater lobby.
343	00:20:17	00:20:21	Unfortunately, there was no epithelials inside the gloves because the cleaning woman had ammonia on her hands.
344	00:20:21	00:20:23	Ah, I see.
345	00:20:23	00:20:27	Well, according to this, a phone call was made 25.
346	00:20:27	00:20:32	Well, Audrey called Dr. Sugarman's cell 26.
347	00:20:32	00:20:36	Well, obviously, she didn't make it home in one minute.
348	00:20:36	00:20:37	We're looking for someone else.
349	00:20:37	00:20:40	The mysterious redhead in the theater?
350	00:20:40	00:20:43	Maybe Audrey hired a pro who called up to say, uh, It's done.
351	00:20:43	00:20:47	Well, if she couldn't afford a powerful attorney, how did she pay for a hit man?
352	00:20:47	00:20:49	Hit woman.
353	00:20:49	00:20:51	Why don't we ask her?
354	00:20:56	00:20:59	You hear that? Phone's off the hook.
355	00:21:06	00:21:08	There must be another way in.
356	00:21:45	00:21:52	She used an extension cord and tied it to the railing and must have jumped off.
357	00:21:58	00:22:00	Yeah, this is Brass.
358	00:22:00	00:22:02	I got a DB.
359	00:22:02	00:22:05	Yeah.
360	00:22:13	00:22:18	Our only suspect apparently commits suicide.
361	00:22:18	00:22:20	Convenient.
362	00:22:22	00:22:24	Too convenient.
363	00:22:28	00:22:30	Catherine...
364	00:22:30	00:22:35	she's got a whole nother set of horizontal marks on her neck, below the cord.
365	00:22:35	00:22:39	And postmortem bruising.
366	00:22:39	00:22:43	I think she was strangled first, and then hanged.
367	00:22:45	00:22:46	No signs of a break-in...
368	00:22:47	00:22:48	or a struggle.
369	00:22:49	00:22:51	She may have been killed by someone she knew.
370	00:22:51	00:22:53	She was dragged.
371	00:22:53	00:22:56	She's got carpet fibers on her heels.
372	00:22:59	00:23:03	Yeah, she was dragged over here, tied off and shoved over.
373	00:23:10	00:23:13	You got something?
374	00:23:13	00:23:19	When we were here earlier, there was a movie schedule pinned up there that had a handwritten note on it.
375	00:23:20	00:23:22	I'm not sure she wanted me to see it.
376	00:23:22	00:23:24	Now it's gone.
377	00:23:24	00:23:26	Maybe she threw it away.
378	00:24:36	00:24:37	Venus and Serena.
379	00:24:37	00:24:39	Perfect match.
380	00:25:22	00:25:25	Timmy's 15, I'm 18.
381	00:25:25	00:25:26	He's got his friends, I got my friends.
382	00:25:26	00:25:28	We don't do the same things.
383	00:25:28	00:25:29	We don't hang together.
384	00:25:29	00:25:30	Evidence says you were there.
385	00:25:30	00:25:32	You want to go down for suspicion of murder?
386	00:25:34	00:25:36	Or you want to stop digging your own grave?
387	00:25:37	00:25:38	Just talked to Bobby Dawson.
388	00:25:40	00:25:42	nine-millimeter semi-automatic.
389	00:25:42	00:25:44	How's this going?
390	00:25:44	00:25:48	I found a 12-pack container in the McCallum minivan.
391	00:25:48	00:25:51	Sales slip said Jenko Liquors.
392	00:25:51	00:25:56	I'll check the surveillance, see if we can get some footage of this guy.
393	00:25:56	00:25:58	What is that on his elbow?
394	00:25:58	00:25:59	It's just a scab.
395	00:25:59	00:26:01	Got it skateboarding.
396	00:26:01	00:26:02	Can we see it?
397	00:26:05	00:26:08	Peel it back.
398	00:26:15	00:26:16	Skateboarding?
399	00:26:17	00:26:19	Why don't you stand up and take off your shirt.
400	00:26:19	00:26:21	Don't you guys need a warrant for that?
401	00:26:21	00:26:25	We get a warrant, and we're going to strip you down to nothing, then ask you to bend over-- choose.
402	00:26:33	00:26:35	Geez, man, what happened to you?
403	00:26:35	00:26:37	Turn around.
404	00:26:40	00:26:41	Those are the same markings your brother had.
405	00:26:41	00:26:43	You want to tell us what went down here?
406	00:26:43	00:26:45	I can't talk about it.
407	00:26:47	00:26:48	I'm sorry.
408	00:26:48	00:26:52	Hey, listen, if-if you're the victim here, you can tell us.
409	00:26:53	00:26:55	Okay?
410	00:26:58	00:27:00	Kevin, who did this to you, man?
411	00:27:07	00:27:11	Well, there's an awful lot of water damage, but, um...
412	00:27:11	00:27:13	there's some kind of an impression.
413	00:27:13	00:27:15	Well, maybe this will bring it up.
414	00:27:21	00:27:24	It's written above Strangers On A Train.
415	00:27:24	00:27:27	Strangers On A Train.
416	00:27:27	00:27:28	Is that the one with the perfect murder?
417	00:27:28	00:27:32	Two strangers meet on a train, make a pact to get rid of each other's problems.
418	00:27:32	00:27:35	They figure since neither has a motive for the killings, they won't be caught.
419	00:27:35	00:27:37	Life imitating art?
420	00:27:37	00:27:40	In the movie, Robert Walker kills Farley Granger's wife.
421	00:27:40	00:27:46	Granger didn't think he was serious, so when he refuses to kill Walker's father, Walker goes after him.
422	00:27:46	00:27:50	So if Audrey is Farley Granger...
423	00:27:50	00:27:52	Who's playing Robert Walker's part?
424	00:27:55	00:27:57	Sphere E4-117.
425	00:27:57	00:28:00	Well, that's got to be the Sphere hotel.
426	00:28:00	00:28:02	It's not a hotel room, though.
427	00:28:02	00:28:04	Locker, safety deposit box...
428	00:28:04	00:28:05	Parking space, maybe.
429	00:28:05	00:28:07	Yeah.
430	00:28:10	00:28:11	Audrey who?
431	00:28:11	00:28:13	Hilden.
432	00:28:13	00:28:14	Nah, I never heard of her.
433	00:28:15	00:28:16	What's this about?
434	00:28:16	00:28:17	E4-117.
435	00:28:17	00:28:20	Your assigned parking space.
436	00:28:20	00:28:23	It was written on a movie schedule we found in Ms. Hilden's home.
437	00:28:23	00:28:26	Well, look, I meet a lot of women.
438	00:28:26	00:28:28	She a dancer? She work for me before?
439	00:28:28	00:28:30	Hey, Michelle. Mmm!
440	00:28:30	00:28:36	this show is very hot, all the chicks want to be in it, and actually, they, uh, got to go through me.
441	00:28:38	00:28:39	Ever been to the Art House movie theater?
442	00:28:39	00:28:41	No. Where's that?
443	00:28:41	00:28:44	Have you ever seen any Hitchcock movies?
444	00:28:44	00:28:46	Strangers On A Train?
445	00:28:48	00:28:49	Alfred Hitchcock?
446	00:28:49	00:28:50	Mr. Haines?
447	00:28:50	00:28:53	Whose station is this one?
448	00:28:53	00:28:56	Oh, that's Kelly Goodson's.
449	00:28:56	00:28:57	Royal pain in the ass.
450	00:29:10	00:29:12	Can I help you?
451	00:29:12	00:29:13	That's my locker.
452	00:29:14	00:29:15	It was open.
453	00:29:15	00:29:17	You always snoop through other people's things?
454	00:29:18	00:29:19	I'm with the Crime Lab.
455	00:29:19	00:29:21	I'm a professional snoop.
456	00:29:21	00:29:23	Do you, uh...
457	00:29:23	00:29:25	ever wear that wig when you go out?
458	00:29:25	00:29:28	I never get to go out.
459	00:29:29	00:29:32	Two shows a night, three on weekends.
460	00:29:32	00:29:35	Why? You have something in mind?
461	00:29:35	00:29:36	Do you like the movies?
462	00:29:36	00:29:42	I, uh, noticed you have an Art House Theater schedule on your mirror.
463	00:29:42	00:29:44	Yeah, I've been there a few times.
464	00:29:44	00:29:46	Ever seen Strangers On A Train?
465	00:29:46	00:29:48	No.
466	00:29:48	00:29:50	Is it any good?
467	00:29:50	00:29:52	Yeah, it's good.
468	00:29:55	00:29:57	You use a lot of creams, huh?
469	00:29:57	00:30:02	16 shows a week in these shoes, your legs would be killing you, too.
470	00:30:02	00:30:03	Is that your own recipe?
471	00:30:04	00:30:06	What was it you said you do for a living?
472	00:30:06	00:30:08	I'm a scientist.
473	00:30:08	00:30:13	And, um, I'm up in five minutes, so... you mind?
474	00:30:13	00:30:15	I don't mind.
475	00:30:24	00:30:25	I'm sorry I'm late.
476	00:30:25	00:30:26	What bullet are you on?
477	00:30:26	00:30:29	109, finally.
478	00:30:29	00:30:32	Height, distance, angle.
479	00:30:32	00:30:33	This has been a very laborious shift.
480	00:30:33	00:30:35	Are you in the mood for a light show?
481	00:30:35	00:30:37	Yeah, hook it up.
482	00:30:41	00:30:44	The trajectory is all pointing in one uniform area.
483	00:30:44	00:30:46	Looks like some kind of a pole.
484	00:30:46	00:30:48	Or a bamboo stick.
485	00:30:49	00:30:51	The whole case has been like this.
486	00:30:51	00:30:53	It's like you can't wrap your head around it, you know?
487	00:30:53	00:31:02	A bamboo cane with black swirls descending downward, no GSR, 109 rods, 109 bullets, all fired from the same gun.
488	00:31:02	00:31:10	Camera glass, blood droplets everywhere, DNA that says five people were there, one boy's dead, one boy's injured, and he ain't sayin' nothin'...
489	00:31:11	00:31:12	Is this the end of the road?
490	00:31:12	00:31:14	Forensically?
491	00:31:14	00:31:16	Yes.
492	00:31:19	00:31:20	Hey.
493	00:31:20	00:31:22	Hey, Sara, I was just coming to get you.
494	00:31:22	00:31:24	Surveillance footage from Jenko Liquor.
495	00:31:24	00:31:26	Archie just put together some black-and-white stills.
496	00:31:26	00:31:27	Check it out.
497	00:31:27	00:31:29	Kevin, the older brother, buying beer.
498	00:31:29	00:31:31	Looks like he wasn't alone.
499	00:31:31	00:31:33	No, you're right.
500	00:31:33	00:31:35	He had four other friends with him, including Timmy.
501	00:31:35	00:31:36	And here you go.
502	00:31:39	00:31:41	It's a classic distraction technique.
503	00:31:41	00:31:42	Did it many times.
504	00:31:42	00:31:44	You go in with a group of buddies and you cause a little ruckus.
505	00:31:45	00:31:45	Store owner gets flustered.
506	00:31:46	00:31:47	He wants the kids out of his store.
507	00:31:47	00:31:50	So, he sells them the beer, even though they're underage, and of course they drink it.
508	00:31:50	00:31:52	Well, you know about the camera glass Warrick found, right?
509	00:31:52	00:31:54	That means someone has this all on tape.
510	00:31:54	00:31:58	I say we track down the other kids, see which one of them thinks he's Tarantino.
511	00:32:03	00:32:07	So, get this-- Anthony Haines had a sexual harassment suit filed against him recently.
512	00:32:07	00:32:09	There's a lot of that going around.
513	00:32:09	00:32:11	Uh-huh, from one of the showgirls.
514	00:32:11	00:32:14	Kelly Goodson?
515	00:32:14	00:32:19	She claims that he threatened to fire her if she didn't perform certain sexual favors.
516	00:32:19	00:32:24	You know, she had a business card in her locker-- Langly &amp;amp; Langly, Attorneys-at-Law.
517	00:32:24	00:32:26	It'd be interesting to find out...
518	00:32:26	00:32:28	If Audrey hired the same firm?
519	00:32:28	00:32:29	She did.
520	00:32:31	00:32:33	So, they liked the same movies...
521	00:32:33	00:32:34	they had the same problem...
522	00:32:34	00:32:36	and they hired the same lawyer?
523	00:32:36	00:32:39	Knees bothering you?
524	00:32:43	00:32:48	The extension cord used to strangle Audrey Hilden.
525	00:32:48	00:32:51	The dentist's gold chain.
526	00:32:51	00:32:53	The murderer's gloves.
527	00:32:53	00:32:58	Well, any physical evidence on those gloves would've been compromised by the ammonia.
528	00:32:58	00:33:01	Only on the inside; not necessarily the outside.
529	00:33:01	00:33:05	You use two hands to put on gloves.
530	00:33:05	00:33:06	You're looking for transfer.
531	00:33:07	00:33:09	Special recipe.
532	00:33:46	00:33:50	We go to the warehouse all the time...
533	00:33:50	00:33:53	just go there to party, talk about chicks.
534	00:33:53	00:33:56	Sometimes we smoke out.
535	00:33:56	00:33:58	You take off your shirt, please?
536	00:34:11	00:34:14	I ride BMX bikes...
537	00:34:14	00:34:15	play soccer.
538	00:34:15	00:34:17	Man, I wake up with bruises.
539	00:34:17	00:34:19	We were just messing around.
540	00:34:19	00:34:20	I'm not. A kid's dead.
541	00:34:20	00:34:22	Back to the question.
542	00:34:22	00:34:23	How'd you get the shiner?
543	00:34:24	00:34:27	JJ found a gun in North Town.
544	00:34:27	00:34:30	We were messing with it, shooting the walls.
545	00:34:30	00:34:36	So, one night, I brought my hi-eight camera in, and one of the stray bullets shot my lens out.
546	00:34:38	00:34:40	Who was the shooter?
547	00:34:42	00:34:46	You can tell us and save yourself, or you can let the tape tell us.
548	00:34:46	00:34:48	It's your call.
549	00:34:48	00:34:49	What up?
550	00:34:49	00:34:51	My name's Kevin.
551	00:34:51	00:34:55	These are my boys-- JJ, Earl, Zach, and my little bro Timmy, and this is called...
552	00:34:55	00:34:57	Speedway surfing!
553	00:34:59	00:35:01	Timmy was a big fan of all those reality shows.
554	00:35:01	00:35:04	You know, the don't try this at home stuff.
555	00:35:04	00:35:07	We-We all watched it on TV.
556	00:35:07	00:35:09	So, one day, we're bored.
557	00:35:09	00:35:14	We started making up stunts on our own, trying to outdo each other.
558	00:35:14	00:35:18	Speedway surfing...
559	00:35:18	00:35:19	that was my idea.
560	00:35:21	00:35:23	Come on, hit it!
561	00:35:23	00:35:25	Yeah! Whoo!
562	00:35:27	00:35:29	Whoo!
563	00:35:32	00:35:33	We all did it.
564	00:35:33	00:35:35	Some ate it bad.
565	00:35:35	00:35:37	JJ bruised his tailbone.
566	00:35:40	00:35:42	We were just messing around.
567	00:35:45	00:35:46	Whoo!
568	00:35:49	00:35:51	Then Zach got the fever.
569	00:35:51	00:35:54	Next day, he came up with one.
570	00:35:54	00:35:55	The Human...
571	00:35:55	00:35:57	150-Yard Marker.
572	00:35:58	00:36:01	Ready, boys?
573	00:36:01	00:36:03	Suck it up, big boy.
574	00:36:07	00:36:09	Then it came time for Timmy's turn.
575	00:36:12	00:36:15	He stayed up all night...
576	00:36:15	00:36:18	and by morning he had it.
577	00:36:19	00:36:22	Hi. My name is Timmy McCallum, and this is my debut stunt, so I'm really psyched.
578	00:36:22	00:36:23	It's called...
579	00:36:23	00:36:25	Bamboo Russian Roulette!
580	00:36:25	00:36:26	You ready?
581	00:36:29	00:36:30	Whoo!
582	00:36:30	00:36:32	We did it a bunch of times.
583	00:36:32	00:36:36	You know, we all took turns going up on the roof.
584	00:36:36	00:36:40	We almost stopped when I got shot in the arm...
585	00:36:40	00:36:43	but we were drunk, and so...
586	00:36:45	00:36:47	...we decided to try it one more time.
587	00:36:47	00:36:49	Yeah!
588	00:36:57	00:36:59	Whoo!
589	00:37:11	00:37:14	He kept trying to breathe.
590	00:37:14	00:37:16	I didn't know what to do.
591	00:37:18	00:37:20	I came down from the roof.
592	00:37:20	00:37:21	I went over to his side.
593	00:37:25	00:37:30	I kept saying... Come on, breathe, bro.
594	00:37:30	00:37:32	You can't die on me, man.
595	00:37:38	00:37:40	Why didn't you call an ambulance?
596	00:37:40	00:37:43	I didn't want to get in trouble.
597	00:37:43	00:37:45	So, you just left him for dead?
598	00:37:45	00:37:47	It was an accident.
599	00:37:49	00:37:52	It's not like we had a death wish.
600	00:37:52	00:37:54	You sure about that?
601	00:38:01	00:38:02	Langly &amp; Langly.
602	00:38:02	00:38:03	Mm.
603	00:38:04	00:38:05	I'm sorry?
604	00:38:05	00:38:11	Oh, it's the law firm that both you and Audrey hired to deal with your problems-- Gus Sugarman and Anthony Haines.
605	00:38:12	00:38:16	Tony Haines is a pig... but who's Gus?
606	00:38:16	00:38:21	Well, we're guessing that that's where the two of you first met, at the lawyers'.
607	00:38:21	00:38:23	Or they could've met at the movie theater.
608	00:38:23	00:38:25	Right. Right.
609	00:38:25	00:38:27	I mean, either way, you ladies had a lot in common.
610	00:38:33	00:38:36	Boy, can't you see them watching Strangers on a Train together?
611	00:38:36	00:38:38	Oh, yeah.
612	00:38:38	00:38:44	I'm thinking that Audrey told her everything about her dentist, and she told Audrey everything about Haines.
613	00:38:49	00:38:51	You needed them both dead.
614	00:38:51	00:39:08	So, right out of Strangers on a Train, if you swapped murders, no one could tie you to the victims, and then you started talking specifics-- where the best place would be to kill Haines...
615	00:39:08	00:39:14	someplace dark, secluded-- the parking lot right here at the Sphere.
616	00:39:19	00:39:25	After you stabbed Sugarman, you ripped the gold chain off of his neck as proof that you'd kept up your end of the bargain.
617	00:39:33	00:39:37	And then you walked out into the lobby and called Audrey on the pay phone, to say that the deed was done.
618	00:39:38	00:39:42	And then Audrey called Sugarman three times in a row to see if it was true.
619	00:39:42	00:39:45	She was the one who picked the movie...
620	00:39:45	00:39:46	and made the date.
621	00:39:48	00:39:51	But that's all she did, isn't it?
622	00:39:51	00:39:55	'Cause just like in the movie, she had no intention of killing Haines...
623	00:39:55	00:39:58	and that's when you started harassing her.
624	00:40:04	00:40:05	You'd killed for her.
625	00:40:05	00:40:08	Now she wasn't holding up her end of the bargain.
626	00:40:08	00:40:10	You couldn't let her betray you.
627	00:40:10	00:40:12	So, unfortunately, she had to die, too.
628	00:40:24	00:40:31	So, you made it look like she'd committed suicide, and then you planted Sugarman's gold chain, in hopes that we would think that she killed him, too.
629	00:40:31	00:40:35	The only thing that she had on you was that movie schedule.
630	00:40:35	00:40:36	That had to go.
631	00:40:40	00:40:43	Wow...
632	00:40:43	00:40:45	that is a really good story.
633	00:40:45	00:40:48	You guys must be movie fans yourselves.
634	00:40:48	00:40:50	You're right.
635	00:40:50	00:40:52	It's just a story...
636	00:40:53	00:41:02	...but the chemicals that we found on your gloves and on the extension cord that was used to kill Audrey, that's our proof.
637	00:41:02	00:41:06	Menthol... trolamine salicylate...
638	00:41:06	00:41:09	capsaicin...
639	00:41:12	00:41:15	Eucalyptabalm...
640	00:41:15	00:41:17	Isorcreme...
641	00:41:17	00:41:23	capsaicin ointment-- a unique concoction-- your unique concoction...
642	00:41:25	00:41:28	...and this stuff is all over the evidence.
643	00:41:28	00:41:30	Yeah...
644	00:41:30	00:41:33	it's a pretty good movie.
645	00:41:33	00:41:38	Well, the character that you've been playing, the character that Robert Walker played in the movie...
646	00:41:38	00:41:42	he dies at the end.
647	00:41:52	00:41:55	I said he'd be alone.
648	00:41:55	00:41:58	Hi.
649	00:41:58	00:42:02	What'd I miss?
650	00:42:02	00:42:06	Murder, seduction, deceit-- the usual.
651	00:42:06	00:42:07	Mm.
652	00:42:07	00:42:11	This one of your favorites?
653	00:42:11	00:42:14	Actually, I'm not a big fan of noir.
654	00:42:16	00:42:20	Okay.
655	00:42:20	00:42:26	Well, what do you like?
656	00:42:26	00:42:36	I like silent movies.
