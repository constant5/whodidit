0	00:00:15	00:00:17	Oh, man.
1	00:00:17	00:00:18	What do you got there, Super Dave?
2	00:00:18	00:00:20	First blush?
3	00:00:20	00:00:25	Well, judging from the major crushing injuries to his chest and torso, I'd say a hit and run.
4	00:00:25	00:00:26	More like hit and drag.
5	00:00:26	00:00:29	Guy left a trail.
6	00:00:29	00:00:32	Mmm, that's one hell of a roll, I'll tell you that.
7	00:00:34	00:00:36	You see something?
8	00:00:36	00:00:37	No skid marks.
9	00:00:37	00:00:40	He skidded plenty, but there's no tire marks.
10	00:00:40	00:00:41	So whatever hit him didn't slow down at all.
11	00:00:41	00:00:44	Plus, the angle's all wrong.
12	00:00:44	00:00:44	Look at it.
13	00:00:44	00:00:48	Car would have to be headed off the road to send him flying in that direction.
14	00:00:49	00:00:52	All right, how about body dump?
15	00:00:52	00:00:54	Tossed out, high speed.
16	00:00:54	00:00:56	Come here and check out this glass.
17	00:01:00	00:01:02	Look at the thickness.
18	00:01:02	00:01:04	That's at least five-eighths of an inch.
19	00:01:04	00:01:06	Definitely didn't come from a car.
20	00:01:06	00:01:07	More like a window; it's heavy duty.
21	00:01:10	00:01:11	Guys.
22	00:01:11	00:01:15	Wherever that glass came from, we got plenty of it on the victim.
23	00:01:19	00:01:23	You guys don't think we've got ourselves a jumper here, do you?
24	00:01:23	00:01:29	Well, you do realize the problem with that theory-- there's nowhere to jump from on this block.
25	00:01:30	00:01:33	So where did he come from?
26	00:01:33	00:01:34	Did you get an I.D.?
27	00:01:39	00:01:42	Bradley Weaks, an accountant.
28	00:01:42	00:01:47	Silver Spring Office Tower, 30th floor.
29	00:01:47	00:01:48	Silver Springs...?!
30	00:01:57	00:02:01	Well, you got to admit-- that's one hell of a jump.
31	00:02:43	00:02:45	Looks like a tornado went through this place.
32	00:02:54	00:02:57	This looks like the same glass we found with the victim.
33	00:02:57	00:02:59	Radial pattern, so...
34	00:02:59	00:03:01	came from that direction.
35	00:03:01	00:03:03	Two blown-out windows.
36	00:03:03	00:03:06	It's just like an entrance and an exit wound.
37	00:03:06	00:03:12	Something blasted in from that window, cut the corner of the room here, and then goes out that one.
38	00:03:12	00:03:13	Yeah, but what the hell was it?
39	00:03:13	00:03:15	I mean, this glass is thick.
40	00:03:15	00:03:18	Normally, you could hit these windows with a baseball bat, they wouldn't even blink.
41	00:03:18	00:03:21	Yeah, I think we're way beyond a baseball bat here.
42	00:03:21	00:03:22	Look at that.
43	00:03:26	00:03:28	Scorch mark.
44	00:03:29	00:03:32	Do you think this thing was rocket-powered?
45	00:03:32	00:03:35	Like a rocket-propelled grenade, maybe?
46	00:03:35	00:03:37	Then why's the office still in one piece?
47	00:03:37	00:03:39	Didn't detonate?
48	00:03:39	00:03:40	Maybe it was a dud.
49	00:03:40	00:03:41	Or on a timer.
50	00:03:41	00:03:44	Some of these are triggered by a signal-- maybe the signal was never sent.
51	00:03:47	00:03:53	Now, what if the guy was standing here, and this rocket-propelled whatever hits him...
52	00:03:55	00:04:01	...carries him out the window, sends him 30 floors down and 100 yards up the street.
53	00:04:01	00:04:02	This guy was an accountant.
54	00:04:02	00:04:08	Somebody decides to take him out, and they use a rocket-powered something to do it.
55	00:04:08	00:04:09	That don't make any sense to me.
56	00:04:09	00:04:11	Maybe we'll know more when we find it.
57	00:04:11	00:04:13	What goes up has to go down, right?
58	00:04:13	00:04:15	It's got to be out there somewhere.
59	00:04:15	00:04:18	Okay, so that's puzzle number one.
60	00:04:18	00:04:22	Puzzle number two is putting this window back together.
61	00:04:22	00:04:26	Maybe we can figure out what came through it.
62	00:04:26	00:04:26	Your pick.
63	00:04:28	00:04:33	Needle in a haystack, or the impossible jigsaw.
64	00:04:33	00:04:34	Why don't you take the easy one.
65	00:04:34	00:04:35	Which one is that?
66	00:05:16	00:05:17	What do you think?
67	00:05:17	00:05:21	Well, it's not 100%, but it's enough to see an impact zone.
68	00:05:21	00:05:22	Yeah.
69	00:05:22	00:05:24	Bigger than any RPG I've ever seen.
70	00:05:24	00:05:25	Yeah.
71	00:05:27	00:05:29	It's, uh...
72	00:05:29	00:05:32	it's about 24 to 30 inches.
73	00:05:32	00:05:36	Something that big and rocket-powered?
74	00:05:36	00:05:39	I mean, unless we're talking about a damn cruise missile...
75	00:05:39	00:05:41	What do you think it could have been?
76	00:05:41	00:05:43	Honestly, I have no idea.
77	00:05:45	00:05:47	Hey, can I bounce something off you? Sure.
78	00:05:47	00:05:52	So, I've been looking into the death of our CPA, trying to figure out who would want to take him out in such a spectacular fashion.
79	00:05:52	00:05:53	Did you come up with something?
80	00:05:53	00:05:56	I don't know, I mean, this guy is as average as average gets.
81	00:05:56	00:05:58	He's a mid-level CPA at a mid-tier firm.
82	00:05:58	00:06:01	But there is one possible lead.
83	00:06:01	00:06:04	The firm where the victim worked-- Baker, Smith, Capaldi.
84	00:06:04	00:06:09	They, along with about 20 other firms across the country, have very tenuous ties with the Colombian cartel.
85	00:06:09	00:06:11	You're thinking this is a cartel hit?
86	00:06:11	00:06:12	I don't know what I'm thinking.
87	00:06:12	00:06:17	I'm trying to draw a line between a... a Vegas accountant and a possible RPG attack.
88	00:06:17	00:06:21	So far, the cartel angle is the only connection I've been able to come up with.
89	00:06:29	00:06:30	Hey.
90	00:06:30	00:06:31	You having any luck?
91	00:06:31	00:06:33	Actually, I am.
92	00:06:33	00:06:36	I've isolated some of the trace from our mysterious UFO.
93	00:06:36	00:06:38	It's a UFO now?
94	00:06:41	00:06:43	Unidentified Flying Object.
95	00:06:43	00:06:48	Although, admittedly, I do find the notion that we are not alone in this universe to be oddly comforting.
96	00:06:48	00:06:50	Uh-huh.
97	00:06:50	00:06:54	What did you find out about whatever this rocket thing was?
98	00:06:54	00:06:56	For starters, it wasn't a rocket.
99	00:06:56	00:06:58	Or at least not rocket-powered.
100	00:06:58	00:07:01	I found fuel residue in the scorch marks.
101	00:07:01	00:07:04	Jet-A aviation fuel.
102	00:07:04	00:07:05	So it was jet-powered?
103	00:07:05	00:07:12	Yes, the marks come from close contact with the exhaust nozzle from a jet engine rather than a rocket.
104	00:07:12	00:07:15	Which implies an entirely different type of flying object.
105	00:07:15	00:07:16	Mm-hmm.
106	00:07:16	00:07:19	More likely, it's something that was piloted rather than fired.
107	00:07:19	00:07:22	And there was something else telling about these scorch marks.
108	00:07:22	00:07:29	You expose wood to intense heat, such as the case here, and you get a spontaneous breakdown of the cellulose into charcoal.
109	00:07:31	00:07:33	But what is charcoal?
110	00:07:33	00:07:34	Carbon.
111	00:07:34	00:07:35	Obviously.
112	00:07:35	00:07:39	Carbon with some tarry residue and a little bit of wood ash.
113	00:07:39	00:07:41	The hotter the burn, the faster the process happens.
114	00:07:41	00:07:45	The faster it happens, the less wood ash you're gonna have left in the mix.
115	00:07:45	00:07:49	Yeah, so you measure the amount of ash, you get a rough idea of how hot it was burning.
116	00:07:49	00:07:51	I can go one better.
117	00:07:51	00:07:58	By measuring the wood ash over the length of the burn, we can determine whether our jet was throttling up or throttling down, so to speak.
118	00:07:58	00:07:59	And?
119	00:07:59	00:08:03	Tip to tip, the intensity of the burn drops 20%.
120	00:08:03	00:08:06	Wait, so it was slowing down? Rapidly.
121	00:08:06	00:08:11	Based on the relative fuel residue, I'd say it was running out of gas.
122	00:08:11	00:08:12	Which means it couldn't have gone far.
123	00:08:12	00:08:14	Depends on your definition of far.
124	00:08:14	00:08:19	Even if this thing was slowing down, it still had significant velocity.
125	00:08:19	00:08:24	Enough to crash through two windows and take a 175-pound man with it.
126	00:08:24	00:08:26	Any way to calculate where it landed?
127	00:08:26	00:08:37	I've been playing with some numbers, uh, based on the energy necessary to break the glass, the momentum transferred to the victim, gravity, elevation, but these are only ballpark figures right now.
128	00:08:37	00:08:39	Ballpark's better than nothing.
129	00:08:39	00:08:41	What are the numbers telling you?
130	00:08:41	00:08:45	Well, the numbers tell me it could have traveled another quarter, maybe half, mile...
131	00:08:45	00:08:47	in this general arc...
132	00:08:47	00:08:49	landed somewhere...
133	00:08:49	00:08:50	in that area.
134	00:08:52	00:08:54	Okay, I'll make the call.
135	00:08:54	00:08:55	Get the uniforms out there.
136	00:08:55	00:08:56	All right, cool.
137	00:09:01	00:09:05	While unis were canvassing the area, they said they found this.
138	00:09:11	00:09:12	Kidding me?
139	00:09:12	00:09:13	It looks like a war zone.
140	00:09:21	00:09:24	Looks like we have what's left of a body.
141	00:09:24	00:09:26	Ugh.
142	00:09:26	00:09:28	Cab driver must have been sitting in here.
143	00:09:28	00:09:30	Sleeping, maybe.
144	00:09:30	00:09:31	That would be a rude awakening.
145	00:09:31	00:09:33	Right? Pulverized.
146	00:09:33	00:09:36	Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing to my cab?
147	00:09:36	00:09:38	Look at it, what am I supposed to do now?
148	00:09:38	00:09:40	That's my livelihood.
149	00:09:40	00:09:41	All right, sir, we're from the Vegas crime lab.
150	00:09:41	00:09:43	Was there a fare in your taxi?
151	00:09:43	00:09:44	Somebody waiting, anything like that?
152	00:09:44	00:09:45	No, what are you talking about?
153	00:09:45	00:09:48	I've been off duty for 12 hours, I just woke up.
154	00:09:48	00:09:49	Nobody was in my cab.
155	00:09:49	00:09:50	All right, all right.
156	00:09:51	00:09:54	I'll tell you what, this officer's gonna take your statement, okay?
157	00:09:54	00:09:57	This is not how I needed to start my day.
158	00:09:59	00:10:00	Hey...
159	00:10:01	00:10:04	if that's the cab driver, then who got blown to bits in here?
160	00:10:04	00:10:06	That's a good question.
161	00:10:15	00:10:18	This might be part of our missile.
162	00:10:18	00:10:19	Engine, maybe.
163	00:10:21	00:10:25	This might be the nose cone.
164	00:10:25	00:10:28	Ugh, Nick.
165	00:10:28	00:10:29	It's part of a helmet.
166	00:10:30	00:10:30	Look at this...
167	00:10:35	00:10:36	Is that a boot?
168	00:10:36	00:10:36	Yeah.
169	00:10:37	00:10:39	Somebody's foot's still in it.
170	00:10:45	00:10:48	Whoever it was wasn't sitting in here.
171	00:10:48	00:10:50	I think they flew in here.
172	00:10:50	00:10:52	Our missile was a man?
173	00:11:01	00:11:03	Oh! Sheesh...
174	00:11:04	00:11:06	It's called a wingsuit.
175	00:11:06	00:11:07	Or-or a squirrel suit. Same difference.
176	00:11:09	00:11:11	And this is what our guy was doing?
177	00:11:11	00:11:13	That's a hell of a lot of kinetic energy.
178	00:11:13	00:11:14	How fast we going there, do you think?
179	00:11:14	00:11:19	Oh, around 220 miles an hour, depending on good design and proper fit.
180	00:11:19	00:11:21	It turns falling into flying, basically.
181	00:11:21	00:11:23	But that wasn't good enough for our guy.
182	00:11:23	00:11:28	He puts the suit on, figures it's not dangerous enough, so he straps jet engines to his feet?
183	00:11:28	00:11:30	He was begging for trouble.
184	00:11:30	00:11:32	Well, I don't think he'd argue with that now.
185	00:11:33	00:11:38	So, anyway, Morgan's been working with David, trying to separate the man from the machine.
186	00:11:38	00:11:39	Literally.
187	00:11:39	00:11:40	So I'm gonna go in there and check on her.
188	00:11:40	00:11:42	She should be back by now.
189	00:11:42	00:11:43	Okay.
190	00:11:47	00:11:48	Hey.
191	00:11:49	00:11:51	How's it going in here?
192	00:11:51	00:11:52	It's going.
193	00:11:52	00:11:54	You know, one of my exes was a skydiver.
194	00:11:54	00:11:55	He had a wingsuit.
195	00:11:55	00:11:57	I don't remember it being this high-tech.
196	00:11:57	00:12:00	If anything, it struck me as more of a clown suit.
197	00:12:00	00:12:02	Course, I could've said that about everything he wore.
198	00:12:02	00:12:03	Well, that's probably why he's your ex-boyfriend.
199	00:12:03	00:12:08	(wry chuckle) Now, this suit-- it, uh, it looks different than the one I was just watching.
200	00:12:08	00:12:09	It's more advanced.
201	00:12:09	00:12:13	Looks like some sort of metal exoskeleton across the wings.
202	00:12:13	00:12:15	I haven't seen that before.
203	00:12:15	00:12:16	And this...
204	00:12:16	00:12:20	is what's left of the propulsion system.
205	00:12:20	00:12:24	It's definitely not something that was hacked together in somebody's garage.
206	00:12:24	00:12:25	This is sophisticated.
207	00:12:25	00:12:27	So where in the hell do you think this thing came from?
208	00:12:27	00:12:28	I don't know.
209	00:12:28	00:12:29	But check this out.
210	00:12:29	00:12:32	It's got one more thing my ex didn't have when he was diving.
211	00:12:34	00:12:37	There's a little box integrated into the front of the rigging.
212	00:12:37	00:12:40	And it looks like it has leads connected to the suit, as well.
213	00:12:40	00:12:44	Looks like a mini version of a black box, like they have on airplanes.
214	00:12:44	00:12:45	That's exactly what I was thinking.
215	00:12:45	00:12:46	It's weird, right?
216	00:12:46	00:12:48	Hey.
217	00:12:48	00:12:51	I got an I.D. on your, uh, Rocket Man.
218	00:12:51	00:12:52	Ran his DNA.
219	00:12:52	00:12:56	When he didn't pop in CODIS, I expanded the search to military databases.
220	00:12:56	00:12:57	Military?
221	00:12:57	00:12:58	In this case, Air Force.
222	00:13:00	00:13:02	Captain Robert Holland.
223	00:13:02	00:13:04	He was stationed at Nellis.
224	00:13:04	00:13:05	So has Russell notified the family yet?
225	00:13:05	00:13:07	The wife. She lives on base.
226	00:13:07	00:13:09	The victim's C.O. is bringing her in.
227	00:13:09	00:13:10	All right.
228	00:13:10	00:13:13	Mrs. Holland, I am so sorry for your loss.
229	00:13:13	00:13:16	Thank you.
230	00:13:16	00:13:21	Major Mills, on the phone last night, you said that Captain Holland was not on duty last night.
231	00:13:21	00:13:23	Yes. That's correct.
232	00:13:23	00:13:26	And the wingsuit-- that's property of the Air Force?
233	00:13:26	00:13:31	Uh, no-- technically, it belongs to TRP Aeronautics, a DoD contractor.
234	00:13:31	00:13:35	The Air Force is exploring the possibility of using them in urban incursion.
235	00:13:36	00:13:39	And Captain Holland was on loan to TRP as a test pilot.
236	00:13:39	00:13:42	If he wasn't on duty last night, then...
237	00:13:42	00:13:46	what was he doing in his suit, flying in downtown Vegas?
238	00:13:48	00:13:50	That's a damn good question.
239	00:13:50	00:13:56	All I can tell you is that test pilots-- like Captain Holland-- live to fly.
240	00:13:56	00:14:00	It wouldn't be the first time one of them stole a prototype to log a few extra hours.
241	00:14:00	00:14:01	No.
242	00:14:01	00:14:02	Bobby wasn't like that.
243	00:14:02	00:14:04	He-he never took unnecessary risks.
244	00:14:04	00:14:05	He wasn't that kind of pilot.
245	00:14:05	00:14:08	Amanda, you have to understand-- Bobby didn't want you to worry.
246	00:14:08	00:14:12	Now, I'm sure he downplayed the risks of whatever he was involved in, authorized or no.
247	00:14:12	00:14:14	And that's not a criticism.
248	00:14:14	00:14:16	Taking risks is what made Bobby a great pilot.
249	00:14:18	00:14:19	Mrs. Holland...
250	00:14:20	00:14:23	when was the last time you saw your husband?
251	00:14:23	00:14:25	Truthfully, it's been about three days.
252	00:14:25	00:14:26	Three days ago?
253	00:14:26	00:14:30	Ever since he started working for TRP, it's not uncommon for him to be gone for days at a time.
254	00:14:30	00:14:35	Mr. Russell, I understand that this accident resulted in the death of a civilian.
255	00:14:35	00:14:39	Now, for the record, the blame here lies entirely with TRP Aeronautics.
256	00:14:39	00:14:44	They never should've allowed the unauthorized removal of that prototype from their facility.
257	00:14:44	00:14:47	Major, you keep saying that like Bobby did something wrong.
258	00:14:49	00:14:53	Mr. Russell, if you don't mind, Captain Holland's parents have yet to be notified.
259	00:14:55	00:14:56	Oh, I'm sorry.
260	00:14:56	00:14:58	I, um... I forgot my phone.
261	00:14:58	00:15:00	I'll bring the car around.
262	00:15:03	00:15:04	Mr. Russell...
263	00:15:05	00:15:06	I don't care what anybody says.
264	00:15:06	00:15:07	I know my husband.
265	00:15:07	00:15:09	And he wasn't some yeehaw test pilot.
266	00:15:09	00:15:11	He never would've flown without authorization.
267	00:15:11	00:15:13	Think the Air Force is covering something up?
268	00:15:13	00:15:14	I think they're trying to blame Bobby.
269	00:15:14	00:15:17	That way, they can avoid paying death benefits, they can take away his pension...
270	00:15:17	00:15:19	I mean, it's all about money.
271	00:15:19	00:15:21	They don't even care that they dirty his name.
272	00:15:21	00:15:25	Well, if there's something to find, Mrs. Holland, I promise you, we'll find it.
273	00:15:25	00:15:26	Okay.
274	00:15:27	00:15:28	Thank you.
275	00:15:30	00:15:34	I've been examining the wingsuit, and our flyer's rig has two chutes.
276	00:15:34	00:15:36	A primary...
277	00:15:36	00:15:37	and a reserve.
278	00:15:37	00:15:39	Now, neither one of them deployed.
279	00:15:39	00:15:43	Why? I don't know, but you gotta figure the guy was either dead or unconscious when he hit that office tower.
280	00:15:43	00:15:45	Wouldn't have pulled the ripcord.
281	00:15:45	00:15:52	But the reserve has an AAD-- an automatic activation device, which should have deployed on its own.
282	00:15:52	00:15:53	No matter what.
283	00:15:53	00:15:57	So was the AAD damaged by the impact?
284	00:16:00	00:16:03	Well, no sign of external damage.
285	00:16:03	00:16:05	Okay, the trigger's based on air pressure, right?
286	00:16:05	00:16:06	Needs two things to pop.
287	00:16:06	00:16:11	You gotta to be really close to the ground, and you gotta be falling... really fast.
288	00:16:11	00:16:12	Which would scare me into popping.
289	00:16:12	00:16:14	Okay, so...
290	00:16:14	00:16:15	let's scare it.
291	00:16:15	00:16:17	See what happens.
292	00:16:17	00:16:18	Okay.
293	00:16:19	00:16:24	All we've got to do is trick this bad boy into thinking it's taking a fall, yeah?
294	00:16:24	00:16:29	We suck the air out, lower the air pressure inside, the chute thinks it's at altitude.
295	00:16:29	00:16:31	Couple thousand feet ought to do it, don't you think?
296	00:16:38	00:16:41	All we need now is the fall.
297	00:16:44	00:16:45	Geronimo!
298	00:16:47	00:16:50	Altimeter's showing a rapid descent...
299	00:16:50	00:16:53	(beeps) ...altitude's dropping, all the way to zero.
300	00:16:57	00:16:58	It should've fired.
301	00:16:59	00:17:00	Excuse me.
302	00:17:09	00:17:11	Standard barometric sensor.
303	00:17:11	00:17:13	Hold on-- Nick, check this out.
304	00:17:16	00:17:18	That's obviously been tampered with.
305	00:17:18	00:17:20	Tool marks. Two-pronged pattern.
306	00:17:20	00:17:22	The circuit's been cut.
307	00:17:23	00:17:26	Well, let's see what happens if I bridge the circuit.
308	00:17:30	00:17:32	All right, you ready? Yeah.
309	00:17:38	00:17:41	And that's what turns an accident into murder.
310	00:17:46	00:17:47	I'm so sorry, Ms. Mason.
311	00:17:47	00:17:49	These officers want to have a word with you.
312	00:17:49	00:17:51	It's all right, Ellen.
313	00:17:52	00:17:55	Obviously, they have news about Captain Holland.
314	00:17:55	00:17:56	Is that right, officers?
315	00:17:56	00:17:57	What makes you say that?
316	00:17:59	00:18:01	Thank you.
317	00:18:02	00:18:10	Well, last night, Captain Holland stole a wingsuit prototype from this facility, a very expensive prototype, and we have not seen him since.
318	00:18:10	00:18:13	So, either he caught the largest thermal in history, or he's gotten himself into trouble.
319	00:18:13	00:18:15	You're here, so, I'm guessing it's the latter?
320	00:18:15	00:18:16	Your guess would be right.
321	00:18:16	00:18:17	The captain crashed the suit.
322	00:18:17	00:18:20	Killed a civilian and himself.
323	00:18:21	00:18:24	That means you have questions.
324	00:18:24	00:18:28	Uh, okay. I expect you'll want to start with our Project Icarus lab.
325	00:18:28	00:18:29	Icarus?
326	00:18:29	00:18:32	Icarus. Greek myth. Wax wings, flew too close to the sun.
327	00:18:32	00:18:40	That's a bit of an inauspicious name for a wingsuit project, given the way things turned out for poor old Icarus, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
328	00:18:40	00:18:42	CSI Nick Stokes.
329	00:18:42	00:18:44	Well, CSI Nick Stokes...
330	00:18:44	00:18:45	follow me.
331	00:18:46	00:18:47	Okay...
332	00:19:00	00:19:04	Captain, this is CSI Nick Stokes. And...
333	00:19:04	00:19:06	Detective Crawford.
334	00:19:06	00:19:07	Captain Ferris.
335	00:19:07	00:19:08	Is this about Holland?
336	00:19:09	00:19:12	Lance... Holland is dead.
337	00:19:12	00:19:13	What?
338	00:19:15	00:19:16	God, what happened?
339	00:19:17	00:19:18	He had an accident. Not in the suit.
340	00:19:18	00:19:20	Yeah, it was in the suit.
341	00:19:20	00:19:22	It's evidence.
342	00:19:22	00:19:24	No, I-I don't... I don't think you understand.
343	00:19:24	00:19:25	We're at a critical stage in testing.
344	00:19:25	00:19:28	I need to see that suit to determine what went wrong.
345	00:19:28	00:19:30	We're the ones examining it now, okay?
346	00:19:32	00:19:35	You do have some interesting tools here, Captain.
347	00:19:35	00:19:37	Like that one in your hand.
348	00:19:37	00:19:38	What is that used for?
349	00:19:39	00:19:42	It's specially made, used to adjust the attack angle on the wing.
350	00:19:42	00:19:43	Specially made?
351	00:19:43	00:19:44	By me.
352	00:19:44	00:19:46	My design.
353	00:19:48	00:19:51	Mind if I take it back to the crime lab?
354	00:19:51	00:19:51	Why?
355	00:19:52	00:19:54	Well, we can talk about that downtown.
356	00:19:57	00:19:59	Wait... am I under arrest?
357	00:19:59	00:20:01	Captain Ferris, just go with the officers.
358	00:20:01	00:20:03	I mean, we have nothing to hide, right?
359	00:20:05	00:20:06	Please.
360	00:20:09	00:20:10	Thank you.
361	00:20:16	00:20:22	Here's the deal someone used a tool just like yours to sabotage the AAD on Holland's reserve parachute.
362	00:20:22	00:20:24	Bobby was like a brother to me.
363	00:20:24	00:20:27	Yeah, we imagine there's a lot of camaraderie between test pilots.
364	00:20:27	00:20:29	Lot of competition, too, right?
365	00:20:29	00:20:31	Yeah. Not so that I would do something to him.
366	00:20:31	00:20:34	Okay, come on, man, we're just trying to get some answers, here.
367	00:20:34	00:20:36	Poor guy's widow deserves that much, don't you think?
368	00:20:36	00:20:38	God.
369	00:20:38	00:20:39	Amanda...
370	00:20:39	00:20:40	Yeah, Amanda.
371	00:20:40	00:20:45	And right now, she thinks the Air Force is going to hold back her husband's benefits for stealing that suit.
372	00:20:45	00:20:46	Look...
373	00:20:46	00:20:48	Bobby didn't steal the suit.
374	00:20:48	00:20:51	Well, your C.O. sure seems to think he did.
375	00:20:51	00:20:54	As does Ms. Mason, the CEO of TRP.
376	00:20:54	00:20:55	No, that... that's bull.
377	00:20:55	00:21:03	From the Air Force perspective, maybe the flight was unauthorized, but not TRP. God...! (groans)
378	00:21:03	00:21:05	Can I get something for my headache?
379	00:21:05	00:21:07	In a minute-- keep talking about TRP.
380	00:21:07	00:21:11	Are you saying that they knew Captain Holland was testing the suit on his own?
381	00:21:11	00:21:14	It's Claudia, she's got us pushing the limits.
382	00:21:14	00:21:17	Logging extra hours in the simulator, in the hypobaric chamber.
383	00:21:17	00:21:19	Was she encouraging after-hours flights?
384	00:21:19	00:21:23	More than encourage, she, uh, she paid incentives.
385	00:21:23	00:21:25	Cash awards for hitting milestones.
386	00:21:25	00:21:31	Last month, Bobby, he made, um, 25 grand for sustained level flight.
387	00:21:33	00:21:35	You all right there, Captain Ferris?
388	00:21:42	00:21:43	Hey.
389	00:21:43	00:21:44	Captain.
390	00:21:44	00:21:45	Hey.
391	00:21:48	00:21:50	Hey, man, do you know where you are right now?
392	00:21:50	00:21:51	H-Hey.
393	00:21:51	00:21:52	Hey, guys.
394	00:21:52	00:21:54	Hey.
395	00:21:54	00:21:56	H-Hey, you guys remember that girl?
396	00:21:57	00:21:59	Th-That one time?
397	00:21:59	00:22:01	Man, what was her name?
398	00:22:01	00:22:02	Hmm?
399	00:22:02	00:22:03	Captain?
400	00:22:03	00:22:05	Captain.
401	00:22:05	00:22:06	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
402	00:22:06	00:22:07	Call rescue.
403	00:22:07	00:22:09	We need paramedics in here!
404	00:22:09	00:22:11	Captain?
405	00:22:11	00:22:13	I got you, I got you.
406	00:22:13	00:22:14	What the hell is happening?
407	00:22:14	00:22:16	I don't know, I don't know.
408	00:22:21	00:22:22	Captain?
409	00:22:26	00:22:28	Crawford, he's dead.
410	00:22:34	00:22:36	Heard you were working on Captain Ferris.
411	00:22:36	00:22:38	What have you got, Doc?
412	00:22:38	00:22:39	Textbook.
413	00:22:39	00:22:42	I could've told you cerebral edema without even looking at the body.
414	00:22:43	00:22:48	Brain tissue's like any other part of the body, it swells in response to injury or illness.
415	00:22:48	00:22:50	Yeah, but unlike the rest of the body, the brain has nowhere to go.
416	00:22:50	00:22:54	True, it swells against the skull, causing neurovascular constriction.
417	00:22:54	00:22:56	Cutting off the brain's oxygen supply.
418	00:22:56	00:22:59	So if that's C.O.D., what caused the edema?
419	00:22:59	00:23:00	The list of possibilities is long.
420	00:23:00	00:23:05	The fact that Captain Ferris was a pilot suggested to me we could be dealing with HACE.
421	00:23:05	00:23:06	HACE?
422	00:23:06	00:23:10	It's an acronym-- High-Altitude Cerebral Edema.
423	00:23:10	00:23:14	It's a form of altitude sickness caused by repeated rapid ascents.
424	00:23:14	00:23:16	It's not the first time I've seen it, either.
425	00:23:16	00:23:17	What do you mean?
426	00:23:17	00:23:30	Well, as I'm sure you remember, there was not a lot of Captain Holland left to examine, but his brain tissue did present vasogenic edema, capillary leakage and spongiosis of the white matter, and those are all consistent with HACE.
427	00:23:30	00:23:35	Do you think it's possible that Holland could have stroked out mid-flight, the same way that Ferris stroked out mid-sentence?
428	00:23:35	00:23:42	It's possible-- if he was dropped off a plane at altitude in a wingsuit, that could certainly cause the onset of HACE.
429	00:23:42	00:23:46	A hypobaric chamber replicates the condition of high altitude, right?
430	00:23:46	00:23:47	Right, the Air Force uses them for training.
431	00:23:47	00:23:51	According to Nick, TRP uses them, as well.
432	00:23:51	00:23:55	They want to make sure that their pilots can function, even with altitude sickness.
433	00:23:55	00:23:59	Training like that's dangerous-- the margin of error is incredibly small.
434	00:23:59	00:24:02	And if you get even a little bit aggressive, the effects could be lethal.
435	00:24:06	00:24:10	People, no, this work is unacceptable.
436	00:24:10	00:24:13	We're not building these suits for some jackass buzzing a half-time show, okay?
437	00:24:13	00:24:15	These are weapons of war.
438	00:24:15	00:24:17	You know what, stop. Everybody!
439	00:24:17	00:24:17	Hey!
440	00:24:17	00:24:18	Eyes on me. Listen.
441	00:24:18	00:24:21	I know that there have been a lot of distractions lately, okay?
442	00:24:21	00:24:24	But that is no excuse for failure.
443	00:24:24	00:24:25	Is that clear?
444	00:24:27	00:24:29	Clear enough for me.
445	00:24:29	00:24:31	CSI Stokes.
446	00:24:31	00:24:33	Nice seeing you again.
447	00:24:33	00:24:35	I assume you heard about Captain Ferris.
448	00:24:35	00:24:37	Two tragedies in as many days.
449	00:24:37	00:24:38	It's almost more than one can bear.
450	00:24:38	00:24:41	Almost.
451	00:24:41	00:24:42	Not sure what you mean.
452	00:24:42	00:24:44	Maybe this will make it clear.
453	00:24:45	00:24:47	That's a search warrant.
454	00:24:49	00:24:55	That allows us to seize medical records, program schedules, flight data, all materials related to Project Icarus.
455	00:24:55	00:24:56	I-I don't, I don't understand.
456	00:24:56	00:24:58	I've been absolutely nothing but cooperative.
457	00:24:58	00:25:01	Two of your pilots have died.
458	00:25:01	00:25:03	Both victims of HACE.
459	00:25:03	00:25:04	Unfortunate accidents.
460	00:25:04	00:25:05	Is that really what you want to go with?
461	00:25:05	00:25:12	'Cause on top of the HACE, Captain Holland's parachute was tampered with-- either by the competition or by you.
462	00:25:12	00:25:16	So, quite frankly, I think you're hiding something from me.
463	00:25:19	00:25:22	This warrant is worthless without being cosigned by a military judge.
464	00:25:22	00:25:25	I don't need JAG approval, and you know it.
465	00:25:27	00:25:28	Okay, boys.
466	00:25:28	00:25:29	Yes, sir. Move out.
467	00:25:31	00:25:39	You really want to cooperate with me, give me the decryption key for the code from the black box on Holland's wingsuit.
468	00:25:39	00:25:40	I don't have it.
469	00:25:40	00:25:45	Black boxes are Air Force property, and if you want access, you're gonna have to talk to them.
470	00:25:49	00:25:51	You know what that is, right, Major?
471	00:25:51	00:25:52	Yes, I do.
472	00:25:52	00:25:56	We need the encrypted data from Captain Holland's flight the night he died.
473	00:25:56	00:26:01	According to TRP, as his C.O., you're the only person who can give it to us.
474	00:26:01	00:26:03	That's correct.
475	00:26:03	00:26:04	And?
476	00:26:04	00:26:07	I'm sorry, but I can't give you the decryption code.
477	00:26:07	00:26:09	It's classified and...
478	00:26:09	00:26:11	Two of your pilots are dead.
479	00:26:11	00:26:16	They died working for a contractor who subjected them to unnecessary risks.
480	00:26:16	00:26:19	Might have even killed one of them to cover it up.
481	00:26:19	00:26:21	Those are serious charges, Mr. Russell.
482	00:26:21	00:26:24	These are your guys we're talking about here, Major.
483	00:26:24	00:26:31	TRP did something illegal, and right now, they're just, they're hiding behind the Air Force, they're hiding behind you.
484	00:26:31	00:26:33	My hands are tied.
485	00:26:33	00:26:36	Only if you let them be.
486	00:26:36	00:26:41	Look, this kid, Captain Holland, was under your command.
487	00:26:41	00:26:46	He woke up every morning, and he put his life at risk simply because you asked him to.
488	00:26:47	00:26:50	Help me find some peace for his wife.
489	00:26:51	00:26:53	You need to do the right thing here.
490	00:26:57	00:27:00	There's an alphanumeric pass phrase keyed into each box.
491	00:27:00	00:27:03	I'll have my office send it over to you within the hour.
492	00:27:03	00:27:07	Thank you, Major.
493	00:27:07	00:27:10	Like you said, it's the right thing to do.
494	00:27:18	00:27:20	How goes the data retrieval on the wingsuit man?
495	00:27:20	00:27:24	Honestly, I am crashing and burning, just like him.
496	00:27:24	00:27:25	What do you mean?
497	00:27:25	00:27:27	The numbers don't make sense.
498	00:27:27	00:27:29	I think maybe the data's corrupted.
499	00:27:29	00:27:31	I mean, this thing was involved in a serious crash.
500	00:27:31	00:27:34	Black boxes are designed to withstand crashes.
501	00:27:34	00:27:35	That's the whole point.
502	00:27:35	00:27:37	Take a look for yourself.
503	00:27:37	00:27:39	At the biometric data.
504	00:27:40	00:27:43	We thought Captain Holland stroked out mid-flight, but look at his vitals.
505	00:27:43	00:27:47	Heart rate, BP, respiratory rate-- all flatlined, the whole way.
506	00:27:47	00:27:50	According to this, he was dead before he even took flight.
507	00:27:50	00:27:51	That can't be possible.
508	00:27:53	00:27:57	You know that Sherlock Holmes quote-- Eliminate all other factors, the one which remains must be the truth.
509	00:27:57	00:27:59	Must be the truth.
510	00:27:59	00:28:02	So we're saying what?
511	00:28:02	00:28:05	We're looking at an elaborate body dump from a plane?
512	00:28:05	00:28:07	Not according to this.
513	00:28:07	00:28:10	Check out the altimeter reading at the start of the flight.
514	00:28:10	00:28:12	2,920 feet.
515	00:28:12	00:28:13	Yeah.
516	00:28:14	00:28:17	Now, given that Las Vegas is roughly 2,200 feet above sea level...
517	00:28:17	00:28:20	That would mean he would jump from a height of 700 feet.
518	00:28:20	00:28:22	He didn't jump from a plane.
519	00:28:22	00:28:24	This is more like a BASE jump.
520	00:28:24	00:28:28	Okay, well, the flight data would give us all the GPS coordinates, right?
521	00:28:28	00:28:29	Right.
522	00:28:30	00:28:34	We know where he landed, now we just got to figure out where he came from.
523	00:28:37	00:28:44	I've reconstructed Captain Holland's flight path on the night he died, zeroing in on the point-of-origin of what we now know was a BASE jump.
524	00:28:44	00:28:47	Beginning here.
525	00:28:48	00:28:50	The Delmore Towers.
526	00:28:50	00:28:53	The top-floor corporate condo, to be precise.
527	00:28:53	00:28:55	Owned by TRP Aeronautics.
528	00:28:55	00:29:01	TRP's CEO, Claudia Mason, used it as her in-town digs.
529	00:29:01	00:29:03	But she wasn't the only one using it.
530	00:29:03	00:29:09	The data on the black box shows a history of BASE jumps at the same condo over the last several months.
531	00:29:09	00:29:12	So Holland was using the Delmore Towers to train.
532	00:29:12	00:29:14	Off base, off hours, off regs.
533	00:29:14	00:29:17	And, we have to assume, with Claudia's approval.
534	00:29:17	00:29:26	You know, all these test pilots vying for the bonuses that TRP was offering, maybe Claudia was just trying to give Holland a leg up on the competition.
535	00:29:26	00:29:29	Maybe that's not all Claudia wanted to give him.
536	00:29:29	00:29:30	Ah.
537	00:29:30	00:29:32	Okay.
538	00:29:32	00:29:33	All right, I like that.
539	00:29:33	00:29:39	So Holland goes up to the tower with his wingsuit, a little off-hour training.
540	00:29:39	00:29:43	But first he and Claudia decide to have, uh, a pre-flight tryst.
541	00:29:43	00:29:45	Things get hot and heavy.
542	00:29:45	00:29:47	But Holland has HACE just like Ferris.
543	00:29:47	00:29:51	And in the heat of passion, he just strokes out.
544	00:29:51	00:29:52	Okay, so I'm Claudia.
545	00:29:52	00:29:54	What do I do?
546	00:29:54	00:29:55	Well, you have two choices.
547	00:29:55	00:29:56	You either call 911...
548	00:29:56	00:30:00	Yeah, but if I do that, I lose my contracts, I lose my company...
549	00:30:00	00:30:12	So you go with choice number two-- You put Holland in his wingsuit, you drag him out onto the balcony, you fire up the jet engines to give him just enough thrust to launch him, and then all you need is a little push.
550	00:30:12	00:30:18	But first you disable the backup chute, so that when he crashes to the Earth, nothing left of him to trace back to you.
551	00:30:18	00:30:21	After all, he was just another reckless flyboy.
552	00:30:21	00:30:23	Stole a suit, went for a joyride.
553	00:30:23	00:30:29	Not a bad plan if you're Claudia Mason, and you're coming up with it on the fly.
554	00:30:29	00:30:30	Yeah.
555	00:30:30	00:30:33	But like all things on the fly...
556	00:30:33	00:30:36	I'm betting that there's something that she missed.
557	00:30:48	00:30:50	You sure about your theory?
558	00:30:50	00:30:53	I'm just saying, doesn't even look like anybody's been here.
559	00:30:53	00:30:55	Well, Claudia Mason must have cleaned up.
560	00:30:55	00:30:58	Let's just hope she's a better CEO than she is a maid.
561	00:31:11	00:31:13	Balcony.
562	00:31:13	00:31:15	Where Holland started his flight.
563	00:31:18	00:31:19	I got some blood.
564	00:31:22	00:31:26	Like Russell said-- Claudia must have missed something.
565	00:31:35	00:31:36	Would you hit the lights?
566	00:31:42	00:31:43	Wow.
567	00:31:44	00:31:46	That is one serious blood pool.
568	00:31:46	00:31:47	Well, it doesn't end there.
569	00:31:48	00:31:50	Got some blood drops.
570	00:31:56	00:31:57	And cast-off.
571	00:31:57	00:32:00	You thought the guy stroked out from HACE, right?
572	00:32:00	00:32:03	Well, that's what I thought, but... I mean, these blood patterns suggest something different.
573	00:32:03	00:32:05	More violent.
574	00:32:05	00:32:06	This is from a brutal beating.
575	00:32:06	00:32:10	It's a crime of passion.
576	00:32:11	00:32:15	You know how they always say, The cover-up is worse than the crime?
577	00:32:15	00:32:17	Not this time.
578	00:32:22	00:32:26	So, what does our CEO have to say for herself?
579	00:32:26	00:32:28	Not a whole hell of a lot, really.
580	00:32:28	00:32:32	She denies knowing anything about Holland going up to the condo to do his BASE-jumping, so...
581	00:32:32	00:32:34	So she denies having an affair, too?
582	00:32:34	00:32:35	Oh, yeah. (sighs)
583	00:32:36	00:32:38	Well, look, the first time, she was hiding behind the Air Force.
584	00:32:38	00:32:42	This time, she's hiding behind that $800-an-hour lawyer.
585	00:32:42	00:32:45	Well, if she won't talk, her condo definitely will.
586	00:33:35	00:33:39	Well, no crime of passion starts without the passion.
587	00:33:39	00:33:40	There were no prints on the murder weapon.
588	00:33:40	00:33:45	But once we run the blood, the fiber, the hairs, maybe we can prove Claudia was here, killing him, too.
589	00:33:45	00:33:47	She may not have been the one wanting to kill him.
590	00:33:47	00:33:51	Just got the security camera footage from the lobby, the night Holland died.
591	00:33:55	00:33:58	That's Holland's wife.
592	00:33:58	00:34:00	The show is just getting started.
593	00:34:06	00:34:08	You lied to us, Amanda.
594	00:34:09	00:34:13	You told me you hadn't seen your husband in days.
595	00:34:13	00:34:18	And that the night he was killed, you assumed he was on a training mission for TRP.
596	00:34:18	00:34:21	This video says you knew exactly where he was.
597	00:34:21	00:34:24	And he was on more than just a training mission.
598	00:34:24	00:34:26	Look, I know what this looks like, but you're wrong.
599	00:34:26	00:34:34	No, I'll tell you what's wrong-- you coming to me asking me to find out what happened to your husband, when you knew all along.
600	00:34:34	00:34:36	No. It is not like that.
601	00:34:36	00:34:37	Okay.
602	00:34:37	00:34:38	Tell us what it's like, then.
603	00:34:41	00:34:44	The past few months, Bobby has been different.
604	00:34:44	00:34:48	At first, I thought it was just this new job at TRP, I mean...
605	00:34:48	00:34:53	But a woman knows when her husband is...
606	00:34:54	00:34:56	Is what?
607	00:34:57	00:34:58	Straying?
608	00:35:03	00:35:06	He said he was going to TRP that night, and I followed him.
609	00:35:06	00:35:07	Downtown.
610	00:35:07	00:35:09	To the condo. Yes. And I confronted him.
611	00:35:09	00:35:12	And I was going to confront that woman, too, whoever she was.
612	00:35:12	00:35:16	But on the way up in the elevator, Bobby swore to me that he was innocent.
613	00:35:16	00:35:19	That he really was there training that night.
614	00:35:19	00:35:21	He was doing a BASE jump from a condo tower.
615	00:35:21	00:35:24	He showed me his wingsuit, he showed me his gear, and I...
616	00:35:24	00:35:25	I had to believe him.
617	00:35:25	00:35:27	I didn't want to lose him.
618	00:35:27	00:35:33	So you didn't go up to the condo, you didn't continue the fight and you didn't kill your husband in a jealous rage.
619	00:35:33	00:35:35	Am I getting that right?
620	00:35:35	00:35:37	I didn't kill Bobby.
621	00:35:37	00:35:40	I'm sorry that I lied to you about seeing him that night.
622	00:35:40	00:35:43	And Major Mills is right-- Bobby didn't follow the rules.
623	00:35:43	00:35:43	He lived on the edge.
624	00:35:43	00:35:47	And jumping from a tower in the middle of the city was against regulations.
625	00:35:47	00:35:52	You lied to us just so that you could keep his death benefits.
626	00:35:52	00:35:54	Yeah.
627	00:35:54	00:35:56	And preserve his memory.
628	00:35:58	00:36:00	And I'm not lying to you now.
629	00:36:00	00:36:04	Then you won't mind giving us a blood and DNA sample, will you?
630	00:36:06	00:36:09	Nick, you need to see this.
631	00:36:09	00:36:09	What is it?
632	00:36:09	00:36:13	Expanded tox panel on Air Force Captain Ferris.
633	00:36:13	00:36:16	I don't think it's any accident that he stroked out on you in Interrogation.
634	00:36:16	00:36:19	Tested positive for furosemide.
635	00:36:19	00:36:20	Isn't that a diuretic?
636	00:36:20	00:36:27	A hard-core diuretic, often abused by models and bodybuilders to get that cut look.
637	00:36:27	00:36:30	Ferris' medical records make no mention of any prescription.
638	00:36:30	00:36:31	Okay, so the guy was on a diuretic.
639	00:36:31	00:36:33	I don't see how that would kill him.
640	00:36:33	00:36:35	Flip the page.
641	00:36:36	00:36:40	You'll see that the furosemide caused a major sodium imbalance.
642	00:36:40	00:36:45	For a guy logging that many hours in a hypobaric chamber, it makes for a lethal combination.
643	00:36:47	00:36:48	Makes for murder.
644	00:37:39	00:37:39	Hey, Henry.
645	00:37:39	00:37:40	Got your text.
646	00:37:40	00:37:42	You have results on the DNA from the condo?
647	00:37:42	00:37:45	I do-- uh, blood is a match to the victim, Captain Holland.
648	00:37:45	00:37:49	Okay, uh, what about the bed? The murder weapon?
649	00:37:49	00:37:52	I found semen contribution from Holland in the bed...
650	00:37:52	00:37:54	Just cut to the chase.
651	00:37:54	00:37:55	Which woman killed him?
652	00:37:55	00:37:57	The wife? Or the boss?
653	00:37:57	00:37:59	The boss was in bed with him.
654	00:37:59	00:38:01	But not the one you're thinking of.
655	00:38:02	00:38:05	Your DNA in the bed, and your DNA on the murder weapon.
656	00:38:05	00:38:08	Mrs. Holland knew her husband was having an affair.
657	00:38:08	00:38:12	She just didn't know it was with his commanding officer.
658	00:38:12	00:38:14	Would you like to tell us what happened that night, Major?
659	00:38:14	00:38:16	Help us understand.
660	00:38:16	00:38:19	You know, maybe it'll help a jury understand.
661	00:38:28	00:38:30	He said he was going to leave me.
662	00:38:31	00:38:32	Said he was afraid.
663	00:38:32	00:38:33	Of what?
664	00:38:33	00:38:34	Afraid of getting caught?
665	00:38:34	00:38:35	It wasn't just an affair.
666	00:38:35	00:38:39	And there is no way that you or anybody can understand that.
667	00:38:42	00:38:43	You could try us.
668	00:38:46	00:38:48	I loved him.
669	00:38:51	00:38:52	And I thought that he loved me, too.
670	00:38:55	00:39:01	He said his wife was asking questions, and that she followed him to the condo that night.
671	00:39:03	00:39:05	Can you believe it?
672	00:39:05	00:39:09	For a second, I was actually relieved.
673	00:39:09	00:39:13	I thought maybe this meant that we could...
674	00:39:14	00:39:18	stop living the lie.
675	00:39:18	00:39:19	But he didn't feel that way, did he?
676	00:39:21	00:39:23	No.
677	00:39:23	00:39:24	It's over.
678	00:39:24	00:39:25	Don't you understand that?
679	00:39:25	00:39:26	I love my wife. You love me.
680	00:39:26	00:39:27	How can you deny who you are?
681	00:39:27	00:39:28	Who we are?
682	00:39:28	00:39:30	Deny? This coming from you?
683	00:39:30	00:39:32	Your whole life is denial.
684	00:39:32	00:39:34	I had to make sacrifices for my career.
685	00:39:34	00:39:37	Yeah, and me, too.
686	00:39:37	00:39:40	And now I'm making another sacrifice.
687	00:39:41	00:39:44	I'm sorry, but...
688	00:39:44	00:39:45	we're done.
689	00:39:48	00:39:50	Don't turn your back on me.
690	00:40:00	00:40:02	I panicked.
691	00:40:02	00:40:05	I... I cleaned up the condo as best I could.
692	00:40:05	00:40:08	Yeah, you put him in the wingsuit and you sabotaged the chute so it wouldn't open.
693	00:40:08	00:40:12	Or, at the very least, make Claudia and TRP the fall guy.
694	00:40:12	00:40:17	Is that why Ferris had to die, too?
695	00:40:17	00:40:18	Yeah, well, we searched your place.
696	00:40:18	00:40:21	And, um, we found this.
697	00:40:21	00:40:24	It's furosemide.
698	00:40:24	00:40:26	What was your plan, Major?
699	00:40:26	00:40:31	I mean, you slip some into his coffee, you hope he strokes out in the hypobaric chamber?
700	00:40:31	00:40:32	But it didn't work out that way, right?
701	00:40:32	00:40:35	He was a strong test pilot.
702	00:40:35	00:40:37	Took a few extra hours.
703	00:40:40	00:40:42	Bobby and Ferris were best friends.
704	00:40:42	00:40:45	If anybody knew the truth about us, it was him.
705	00:40:45	00:40:46	I...
706	00:40:47	00:40:51	had no choice.
707	00:40:51	00:40:53	Major...
708	00:40:53	00:40:56	You always have a choice.
709	00:40:56	00:40:59	And you chose wrong.
710	00:40:59	00:41:01	Twice.
711	00:41:09	00:41:11	Mrs. Holland?
712	00:41:11	00:41:12	You still waiting for something?
713	00:41:12	00:41:13	Haven't they finished with you yet?
714	00:41:13	00:41:15	No, they said I could go.
715	00:41:15	00:41:17	I just...
716	00:41:17	00:41:19	I mean, go where?
717	00:41:19	00:41:21	Home is empty.
718	00:41:21	00:41:24	It's always going to be empty.
719	00:41:26	00:41:31	I'm so sorry.
720	00:41:31	00:41:33	For everything.
721	00:41:33	00:41:35	Your husband...
722	00:41:35	00:41:36	You were just doing your job.
723	00:41:36	00:41:40	I understand.
724	00:41:42	00:41:44	Do you keep secrets from your wife?
725	00:41:46	00:41:49	I used to.
726	00:41:49	00:41:50	Not anymore?
727	00:41:50	00:41:52	No.
728	00:41:56	00:41:58	She's a lucky woman, then.
729	00:42:00	00:42:01	Excuse me.
