0	00:00:09	00:00:11	BOLO out on the vehicle.
1	00:00:11	00:00:14	Lori Kyman.
2	00:00:14	00:00:18	Husband said she went out with some girlfriends earlier this evening, and never came home.
3	00:00:18	00:00:19	FOS.
4	00:00:19	00:00:20	What's an FOS?
5	00:00:20	00:00:22	Friend of the sheriff.
6	00:00:22	00:00:25	How else do you get listed as a missing person so quickly?
7	00:00:29	00:00:30	Doors are locked.
8	00:00:30	00:00:31	No key in the ignition.
9	00:00:34	00:00:36	No sign of struggle or foul play.
10	00:00:36	00:00:38	Flat tire.
11	00:00:38	00:00:40	Couple of smudges.
12	00:00:40	00:00:42	Okay, pop it.
13	00:00:48	00:00:50	So, she gets a flat.
14	00:00:50	00:00:53	There's no gas station around.
15	00:00:53	00:00:56	It's a Lexus, so there's no On‐Star.
16	00:00:56	00:00:58	She must have had some kind of emergency roadside service.
17	00:00:58	00:01:00	I ran her cell phone log.
18	00:01:00	00:01:02	30.
19	00:01:02	00:01:04	00; that's it.
20	00:01:04	00:01:09	Maybe some good Samaritan offered her a lift.
21	00:01:09	00:01:13	Yeah, and evidently didn't take her where she wanted to go.
22	00:01:46	00:01:48	Lori hadn't gotten out much since Joey was born.
23	00:01:48	00:01:52	She needed some time away from the baby, and from me.
24	00:01:52	00:01:54	Girls' night out.
25	00:01:54	00:01:56	We've been best friends since high school.
26	00:01:56	00:01:58	Where'd you go?
27	00:01:58	00:02:00	The Top Floor.
28	00:02:00	00:02:03	That's right next to O'Shea's.
29	00:02:03	00:02:07	Amy, why don't you and I go into the other room? Okay.
30	00:02:07	00:02:09	He's going to need his bottle soon.
31	00:02:09	00:02:11	I'll take care of it.
32	00:02:11	00:02:15	So, Mark, you were home alone with the baby last night?
33	00:02:15	00:02:18	No. Uh, I, uh, I manage the steakhouse at the Tangiers.
34	00:02:18	00:02:19	00.
35	00:02:19	00:02:22	My mother‐in‐law was taking care of Joey.
36	00:02:22	00:02:23	Your mother‐in‐law.
37	00:02:23	00:02:24	I'll need to speak with her.
38	00:02:24	00:02:26	Yeah, she's on her way over.
39	00:02:28	00:02:30	She's in love with her baby.
40	00:02:30	00:02:32	She wouldn't go anywhere without him.
41	00:02:32	00:02:33	What about Mark?
42	00:02:33	00:02:34	Mark loves Lori.
43	00:02:34	00:02:36	He would never hurt her.
44	00:02:36	00:02:39	When a wife disappears, it's protocol to look at the husband.
45	00:02:41	00:02:44	I promised I would never say anything.
46	00:02:44	00:02:48	Before the baby was born, she suspected he was cheating.
47	00:02:48	00:02:52	But then Joey came, and last night at the club, Lori said things were great.
48	00:02:52	00:02:54	Did anything unusual happen last night?
49	00:02:55	00:02:58	There was this one guy who kept moving in on Lori.
50	00:02:58	00:03:00	Hi. Could I ask you a question?
51	00:03:01	00:03:02	It's critical.
52	00:03:02	00:03:03	Okay.
53	00:03:03	00:03:04	Am I your type?
54	00:03:04	00:03:06	I'm married.
55	00:03:06	00:03:07	Oh, yeah?
56	00:03:07	00:03:08	Nice try.
57	00:03:09	00:03:10	Ring.
58	00:03:11	00:03:13	I think his name is Brad.
59	00:03:14	00:03:16	Does Lori always go out without a ring?
60	00:03:16	00:03:17	She had lost some weight.
61	00:03:17	00:03:19	It was being resized.
62	00:03:19	00:03:23	So, Lori calls you at 9 to check on the baby.
63	00:03:23	00:03:24	Yeah. Said she missed him.
64	00:03:25	00:03:26	00.
65	00:03:26	00:03:31	I, uh, passed out on the couch waiting for her.
66	00:03:31	00:03:33	00.
67	00:03:33	00:03:35	Left about an hour later.
68	00:03:35	00:03:37	What about the guy‐‐ Brad?
69	00:03:37	00:03:39	He didn't get the hint.
70	00:03:43	00:03:45	He seemed harmless.
71	00:03:45	00:03:48	Horny... but harmless.
72	00:03:48	00:03:51	00.
73	00:03:51	00:03:53	I called her on her cell.
74	00:03:53	00:03:54	No answer.
75	00:03:54	00:03:56	And then I called Amy.
76	00:03:58	00:04:01	And then I called you guys.
77	00:04:01	00:04:03	So, you haven't left the house since you got home last night?
78	00:04:03	00:04:06	We, uh, only have one car right now.
79	00:04:06	00:04:07	My lease ran out.
80	00:04:08	00:04:09	Any news?
81	00:04:13	00:04:16	They found her car off Boulder Highway.
82	00:04:17	00:04:18	Oh, my God.
83	00:04:20	00:04:22	This is Diane, Lori's mom. Hi.
84	00:04:22	00:04:26	Diane, I want you to know we have every available officer out looking for your daughter.
85	00:04:26	00:04:27	Thank you.
86	00:04:27	00:04:28	Where's Joey?
87	00:04:28	00:04:30	He's with Amy.
88	00:04:30	00:04:31	Okay.
89	00:04:31	00:04:33	You know, I just got a quick couple of questions.
90	00:04:33	00:04:37	Can you confirm you were here last night when Mark came home from work?
91	00:04:37	00:04:38	Yes. I was baby‐sitting.
92	00:04:38	00:04:39	What time was that?
93	00:04:39	00:04:42	Uh... I'd just put Joey down.
94	00:04:42	00:04:44	00.
95	00:04:44	00:04:45	And when did your daughter call?
96	00:04:45	00:04:47	About half an hour later.
97	00:04:47	00:04:48	We both talked to her.
98	00:04:48	00:04:51	9 That's all for now, thank you.
99	00:04:51	00:04:52	Excuse me.
100	00:04:53	00:04:55	What do I do?
101	00:04:55	00:04:57	I'd take care of your family, Mark.
102	00:04:57	00:05:02	And if Ms. Sidle asks, volunteer your fingerprints and DNA.
103	00:05:04	00:05:11	I was making my 16 I confirmed he was deceased.
104	00:05:11	00:05:13	Then I called you guys.
105	00:05:13	00:05:15	Hey.
106	00:05:15	00:05:16	There's no ID on the vic.
107	00:05:16	00:05:18	Lividity is set.
108	00:05:18	00:05:20	Rigidity is still present.
109	00:05:20	00:05:22	Dead no more than 24 hours.
110	00:05:22	00:05:24	Look at those claw marks.
111	00:05:24	00:05:26	His carotid artery is ripped to shreds.
112	00:05:26	00:05:29	He's got a high‐powered rifle.
113	00:05:31	00:05:33	He's obviously a hunter, huh?
114	00:05:33	00:05:34	Safe to say he was mauled by a wild animal?
115	00:05:35	00:05:36	Yeah.
116	00:05:36	00:05:38	Your call came in as suspicious circs.
117	00:05:38	00:05:40	Is there something else we should know about?
118	00:05:40	00:05:42	Yeah, that would be the other body.
119	00:05:42	00:05:43	Follow me.
120	00:05:49	00:05:51	Damn.
121	00:05:51	00:05:52	It's a Kodiak.
122	00:05:53	00:05:55	It's nonnative to the continental US.
123	00:05:55	00:06:00	Shot twice in the head.
124	00:06:00	00:06:01	The stomach's been cut open.
125	00:06:03	00:06:05	That's a pretty deep cut.
126	00:06:05	00:06:08	You think the hunter was just trying to defend himself?
127	00:06:08	00:06:10	I didn't find a blade on the decedent.
128	00:06:10	00:06:13	And there's no way a person can come this close to a live bear.
129	00:06:14	00:06:16	Got some broken branches over here.
130	00:06:18	00:06:22	Directionality faces away from the victim and the animal.
131	00:06:26	00:06:28	Looks like someone even tore their pants.
132	00:06:28	00:06:30	Khakis.
133	00:06:30	00:06:32	Vic's wearing jeans and a nylon vest.
134	00:06:32	00:06:37	I bet somebody else was out here, and they were running for their life.
135	00:06:39	00:06:41	I had to see with my own eyes.
136	00:06:41	00:06:44	You're actually autopsying a bear.
137	00:06:44	00:06:45	It's called a necropsy.
138	00:06:45	00:06:48	And as the head ME, it falls under my purview.
139	00:06:48	00:06:50	I'll write an article for the journal.
140	00:06:50	00:06:51	They love this sort of stuff.
141	00:06:52	00:06:55	Yeah. You have a cause of death on him?
142	00:06:55	00:06:57	I can confirm he was killed by an angry bear.
143	00:07:00	00:07:03	As for the bear‐‐ two bullets to the head.
144	00:07:03	00:07:06	The first, nonfatal, was a straight‐on shot.
145	00:07:07	00:07:17	Bears' foreheads are sloped, so the bullet ricocheted off the skull, leaving a copper jacket, which peeled away and embedded in the hide.
146	00:07:18	00:07:23	The, uh, fatal bullet entered through the ear, lodged in the brain.
147	00:07:23	00:07:24	I removed it already.
148	00:07:24	00:07:25	It's lead.
149	00:07:25	00:07:27	No copper jacket.
150	00:07:27	00:07:30	So, the copper jacket had to have come from his rifle.
151	00:07:30	00:07:33	But this is from a handgun.
152	00:07:33	00:07:36	So, he shot one bullet with his rifle and another with his pistol.
153	00:07:36	00:07:38	Except he didn't have a pistol.
154	00:07:38	00:07:39	Or a knife, for that matter.
155	00:07:39	00:07:42	And his stomach has been slashed open.
156	00:07:42	00:07:45	Yeah, and the gallbladder removed.
157	00:07:45	00:07:46	Really?
158	00:07:46	00:07:48	Postmortem.
159	00:07:48	00:07:49	I can't tell you why.
160	00:08:23	00:08:25	Hey. I ran the vic's prints.
161	00:08:25	00:08:26	Didn't get a hit.
162	00:08:26	00:08:29	We found this guy 25 miles from civilization.
163	00:08:29	00:08:30	Where'd he come from?
164	00:08:30	00:08:32	We know someone else was out there.
165	00:08:32	00:08:33	Maybe he drove.
166	00:08:35	00:08:38	Check out this guy's watch.
167	00:08:38	00:08:41	It's pretty high‐end.
168	00:08:41	00:08:45	Yeah. Hunting's not exactly a poor man's sport.
169	00:08:45	00:08:47	US presidents still hold up dead ducks for photo ops.
170	00:08:48	00:08:50	But it just doesn't match with the guy's clothes.
171	00:08:50	00:08:51	They're kind of raggedy.
172	00:08:51	00:08:52	He's got dirt stains.
173	00:08:52	00:08:54	I could smell the BO from the guy's shirt from here.
174	00:08:54	00:08:58	Some hunters think soap and deodorant tip off their prey.
175	00:08:58	00:09:00	Truth is, body odor's much more pungent.
176	00:09:00	00:09:04	So, Robbins confirmed that our vic was killed by the bear.
177	00:09:05	00:09:06	Okay. Case closed.
178	00:09:06	00:09:08	Uh, not quite.
179	00:09:08	00:09:09	I spoke with the ranger.
180	00:09:10	00:09:15	There's no way that a Kodiak bear just wanders into Nevada, so whoever smuggled him in could be charged with homicide.
181	00:09:15	00:09:16	How's that?
182	00:09:16	00:09:19	The bear could be considered a lethal weapon.
183	00:09:22	00:09:24	Screw.
184	00:09:24	00:09:26	Excuse me?
185	00:09:26	00:09:27	Tire's valve stem was unscrewed.
186	00:09:28	00:09:29	Two full turns.
187	00:09:29	00:09:31	A slow leaker.
188	00:09:31	00:09:34	Print around the fender.
189	00:10:07	00:10:08	Yeah, I was at the Top Floor.
190	00:10:08	00:10:09	I hit on a lot of girls.
191	00:10:09	00:10:11	You can't arrest me for that, right?
192	00:10:11	00:10:13	Tell us about Lori Kyman.
193	00:10:13	00:10:16	Yeah, I remember a Lori.
194	00:10:18	00:10:19	Said she was married.
195	00:10:19	00:10:20	Yeah, right.
196	00:10:20	00:10:22	You dress up like that and go to a club...
197	00:10:23	00:10:24	...you're looking to get some.
198	00:10:24	00:10:27	I found your fingerprints on her car's fender.
199	00:10:27	00:10:30	So? I walked her back to her car.
200	00:10:30	00:10:31	I am a gentleman.
201	00:10:31	00:10:34	Is that when you messed with her tire?
202	00:10:34	00:10:37	Is that what this is about?
203	00:10:37	00:10:38	I don't get out much.
204	00:10:38	00:10:39	Why would you do that?
205	00:10:39	00:10:43	I was hoping it would go flat on her way back home, and I'd come along and fix it for her.
206	00:10:43	00:10:48	And then she'd be appropriately grateful, and what, sleep with you?
207	00:10:48	00:10:51	Seemed like a good idea at the time, yeah.
208	00:10:51	00:10:52	'Course I was tanked.
209	00:10:53	00:10:54	Okay, so Lori's tire went flat.
210	00:10:54	00:10:55	it didn't.
211	00:10:55	00:10:58	I mean, I followed her for like 20 minutes.
212	00:10:58	00:10:59	Way off Strip.
213	00:10:59	00:11:02	And, come on, how long can you follow someone for, right?
214	00:11:02	00:11:03	She never made it home.
215	00:11:05	00:11:07	I don't know anything about that.
216	00:11:07	00:11:09	We're going to need a sample of your DNA.
217	00:11:10	00:11:10	Any objections?
218	00:11:11	00:11:12	Excuse me.
219	00:11:12	00:11:13	Excuse me, Captain.
220	00:11:14	00:11:15	Found a dead female in Sutor.
221	00:11:15	00:11:19	Description matches Lori Kyman.
222	00:11:22	00:11:23	Make yourself comfortable.
223	00:11:31	00:11:34	Guy walking his dog found her.
224	00:11:39	00:11:41	Liver temp's 71 degrees.
225	00:11:42	00:11:48	Given the ambient temperature, her TOD's is roughly between 36 to 40 hours ago.
226	00:11:55	00:12:00	Bruises on the neck suggest strangulation.
227	00:12:06	00:12:08	No attempt to hide the body.
228	00:12:08	00:12:10	Maybe the suspect was in a hurry.
229	00:12:11	00:12:14	Or he just didn't give a damn.
230	00:12:14	00:12:16	Are you gonna tell the family?
231	00:12:16	00:12:20	Yeah, how do you tell a little boy he'll never know his mother?
232	00:12:24	00:12:27	She was dumped under a white birch.
233	00:12:27	00:12:30	Her hair is full of pods and tree vegetation.
234	00:12:43	00:12:45	Red fibers and blue fibers on her dress.
235	00:12:53	00:12:56	White powder on both palms.
236	00:13:06	00:13:10	A brown hair with a follicular tag.
237	00:13:12	00:13:18	A person's entire identity balled up in a few nanograms of matter.
238	00:13:18	00:13:22	Assuming one's identity can be wholly quantified by our DNA.
239	00:13:22	00:13:23	Well, genetically, it can.
240	00:13:24	00:13:26	We're completely programmed as soon as the sperm hits the egg.
241	00:13:27	00:13:30	So we're defined at a cellular level?
242	00:13:30	00:13:31	More or less.
243	00:13:31	00:13:32	No.
244	00:13:32	00:13:35	Identity is the totality of our life experiences.
245	00:13:35	00:13:40	And our brain neurons process our relationship to the world and each other.
246	00:13:40	00:13:42	( camera clicks ) I stand corrected.
247	00:13:42	00:13:45	DNA is what we are, not who we are.
248	00:13:45	00:13:47	What we are never changes.
249	00:13:47	00:13:49	Who we are never stops changing.
250	00:13:49	00:13:51	Yeah. Whether we like it or not.
251	00:13:53	00:13:54	What's up?
252	00:13:54	00:13:59	Well, when I fluoroscoped the bear, looking for other bullets, I noticed a microchip between his shoulder blades.
253	00:13:59	00:14:01	I see.
254	00:14:01	00:14:04	I removed it, called Animal Control to borrow a magnetic reader.
255	00:14:04	00:14:05	Check it out.
256	00:14:10	00:14:12	Clark County Zoo.
257	00:14:21	00:14:24	Are you sure the bear came from our zoo?
258	00:14:24	00:14:26	Well, the microchip was registered to you.
259	00:14:26	00:14:27	Take a look.
260	00:14:27	00:14:29	Oh, God.
261	00:14:29	00:14:31	It's Tippy.
262	00:14:31	00:14:32	What happened?
263	00:14:32	00:14:35	You mean you didn't know he was missing?
264	00:14:35	00:14:36	We sold him to a broker a few weeks ago.
265	00:14:36	00:14:38	He said he found him a home at the Columbus Zoo.
266	00:14:38	00:14:40	A broker? Animal broker.
267	00:14:40	00:14:41	Visitors want to see babies.
268	00:14:41	00:14:45	The brokers find other zoos to purchase our surplus adult animals.
269	00:14:47	00:14:50	You know, Tippy was so gentle, he'd eat grapes right out of my hand.
270	00:14:50	00:14:52	Well, we're going to need to see some paperwork.
271	00:14:52	00:14:54	Yeah, I'll pull the file, but...
272	00:14:54	00:14:55	I remember the broker's name.
273	00:14:56	00:14:57	It's Ken Bovitz.
274	00:14:57	00:14:57	Out of Chicago.
275	00:14:58	00:15:00	He mailed me his broker's license and documentation.
276	00:15:00	00:15:02	The board approved the sale last fall.
277	00:15:02	00:15:05	They'll want to know what went wrong.
278	00:15:05	00:15:07	Yeah, so do we.
279	00:15:07	00:15:10	You giving the car a workout?
280	00:15:10	00:15:15	Well, you know how you said that the suspect admitted to following Lori, but when the tire didn't go flat, he gave up?
281	00:15:15	00:15:17	Grissom wants me to disprove his account.
282	00:15:17	00:15:20	How long has the wheel been going round and round?
283	00:15:20	00:15:23	Three hours and nine minutes.
284	00:15:23	00:15:25	00.
285	00:15:26	00:15:29	00 a. m.
286	00:15:29	00:15:31	Lori died before the tire went flat.
287	00:15:33	00:15:36	I think I know why someone snagged that bear's gallbladder.
288	00:15:36	00:15:42	Apparently, in the southeast Asian community, some men believe it enhances their virility.
289	00:15:42	00:15:46	It contains some chemical called ursodeoxycholic acid.
290	00:15:46	00:15:49	These gallbladders are going for $500 a pop.
291	00:15:49	00:15:51	I, uh, talked to the zoo in Columbus.
292	00:15:51	00:15:52	They never heard of Tippy.
293	00:15:52	00:15:54	Hmm. Any luck with the broker?
294	00:15:54	00:15:58	The Department of Agriculture never issued a license for a Ken Bovitz.
295	00:15:58	00:15:59	Documents are fake.
296	00:16:00	00:16:02	I sent them to QD for analysis.
297	00:16:03	00:16:05	We may have an ID on our hunter.
298	00:16:05	00:16:07	Uniforms found an abandoned Mercedes.
299	00:16:07	00:16:15	Plates came back to a Mr. Ron Hollis, who had hunting permits that included tags for wild goats, deer, and bighorn sheep.
300	00:16:15	00:16:16	And what about Kodiaks?
301	00:16:16	00:16:17	That would be a no.
302	00:16:18	00:16:23	Mr. Hollis's wife's on her way to PD, so I'm gonna head over there right now.
303	00:16:23	00:16:27	To be honest, I haven't seen my husband in over a year.
304	00:16:27	00:16:28	You were separated?
305	00:16:28	00:16:31	He made it big in venture capital.
306	00:16:31	00:16:32	Retired at 32.
307	00:16:32	00:16:36	That's when we started having problems.
308	00:16:36	00:16:38	The officer said Rod died while hunting.
309	00:16:38	00:16:40	Can I ask what happened?
310	00:16:40	00:16:43	He was mauled by a bear.
311	00:16:43	00:16:48	Ms. Hollis, I have reason to believe there was somebody else out there with him.
312	00:16:48	00:16:49	Any idea who?
313	00:16:49	00:16:51	No.
314	00:16:51	00:16:54	In our circle of friends, he was the only one who owned a gun.
315	00:16:55	00:16:57	We used to fight about his sport.
316	00:16:57	00:17:03	I showed him studies about how the animals suffer, how even the best hunters don't always get center shots.
317	00:17:03	00:17:08	Well... I guess brutality begets brutality.
318	00:17:11	00:17:14	COD is asphyxia due to manual strangulation.
319	00:17:14	00:17:20	Petechiae in the eyes and mouth and extensive bruising in the strap muscles of the neck.
320	00:17:20	00:17:21	Sexual assault?
321	00:17:21	00:17:23	No abrasions or contusions to the vagina.
322	00:17:24	00:17:25	No semen on the SART exam.
323	00:17:29	00:17:30	Is this a burn?
324	00:17:31	00:17:32	No tissue reaction means it's post‐mortem.
325	00:17:34	00:17:37	If she were alive at the time, it'd have a red edge.
326	00:17:37	00:17:38	This one's bland.
327	00:17:38	00:17:42	Burn extends subcutaneously, so the skin made contact with something hotter than 150 degrees.
328	00:17:45	00:17:47	Talk to me, Hodges.
329	00:17:47	00:17:50	Well, you kind of inundated me with work.
330	00:17:50	00:17:52	I should be cranky.
331	00:17:52	00:17:53	But, uh, I don't get cranky.
332	00:17:53	00:17:56	Let's start with the white powder you found on your victim's bands.
333	00:17:56	00:17:58	It's talcum power without the talc.
334	00:17:58	00:18:01	Excuse me? Talcum powder can contain asbestos fibers.
335	00:18:01	00:18:03	Who wants to put asbestos on their baby?
336	00:18:03	00:18:07	So, today's baby powders are made from cornstarch, and are technically talc‐free.
337	00:18:07	00:18:09	Did your victim have her baby with her at the club?
338	00:18:09	00:18:11	No, he was at home.
339	00:18:11	00:18:14	So maybe the baby powder was on her hands when she left the house.
340	00:18:14	00:18:17	Well, we know she was drinking, so she was probably peeing.
341	00:18:17	00:18:23	And unlike some of the men in this lab, whose initials are Greg Sanders, she probably washes her hands.
342	00:18:23	00:18:25	So the baby powder shouldn't even be there.
343	00:18:25	00:18:28	Tell me about the fibers we collected from her clothing.
344	00:18:28	00:18:33	Blue ones have a high twist rate and are composed of nylon and polyester olefins.
345	00:18:33	00:18:35	I'd say synthetic Berber.
346	00:18:35	00:18:38	And the red ones are under the scope.
347	00:18:42	00:18:43	Trilobal.
348	00:18:44	00:18:45	From a car.
349	00:18:46	00:18:48	Vic's clothing was covered in them.
350	00:18:48	00:18:50	My guess, she was rolling around in someone's trunk.
351	00:18:53	00:18:55	Can you be more specific?
352	00:18:55	00:18:57	You bet.
353	00:18:57	00:18:58	It's Wilton wool.
354	00:18:58	00:18:59	Very high‐end.
355	00:18:59	00:19:06	And given the unique shade of red, I'd say that you're looking the Bentley Continental GT.
356	00:19:08	00:19:09	Thank you.
357	00:19:16	00:19:18	Yeah, I was here last night.
358	00:19:18	00:19:20	You park a Bentley?
359	00:19:21	00:19:24	Oh, man, my memory's not so good since, um...
360	00:19:25	00:19:28	Well, I can't really remember.
361	00:19:28	00:19:29	You don't remember a Bentley?
362	00:19:29	00:19:31	Let me see what I got.
363	00:19:31	00:19:33	Yeah.
364	00:19:35	00:19:38	Yeah, here you go. One Bentley.
365	00:19:38	00:19:39	32.
366	00:19:40	00:19:41	Parked it in spot 19C.
367	00:19:41	00:19:43	Do you remember, uh, what the driver looked like?
368	00:19:43	00:19:45	Male?
369	00:19:45	00:19:47	Female? Black? Caucasian?
370	00:19:47	00:19:49	Young? Old?
371	00:19:49	00:19:50	He have a hat on?
372	00:19:50	00:19:52	Sorry.
373	00:19:52	00:19:53	Sorry.
374	00:19:55	00:19:56	Amy.
375	00:19:56	00:19:58	Thanks for coming.
376	00:19:58	00:20:01	Of course. How can I help?
377	00:20:01	00:20:05	The other night at the club, I was wondering if you happened to notice anyone driving a Bentley.
378	00:20:05	00:20:07	That would be me.
379	00:20:07	00:20:08	Birthday gift from my father.
380	00:20:08	00:20:11	Would you mind if I took a look at it?
381	00:20:11	00:20:13	You want to see my car?
382	00:20:13	00:20:14	Why?
383	00:20:14	00:20:17	We found fibers from a Bentley on Lori's clothing.
384	00:20:17	00:20:22	Lori was in my car all the time, especially last week.
385	00:20:24	00:20:26	Mark was using hers.
386	00:20:26	00:20:30	The fibers we found are from the floor or a trunk.
387	00:20:35	00:20:36	It's in the lot. I'll call my father.
388	00:20:36	00:20:37	He'll pick me up.
389	00:20:38	00:20:39	Amy...
390	00:20:39	00:20:42	Did Lori use the ladies' room at the club?
391	00:20:42	00:20:43	Yeah.
392	00:20:43	00:20:45	We both did.
393	00:20:45	00:20:47	Do you know if she washed her hands?
394	00:20:47	00:20:49	Why are you asking me all these questions?
395	00:20:50	00:20:51	We're pursuing a lead.
396	00:20:53	00:20:55	Lori was like a sister to me.
397	00:20:55	00:20:59	Investigate me all you want, but when you're done, you should take a look at Mark.
398	00:20:59	00:21:01	Mark. I thought you said...
399	00:21:01	00:21:03	I know what I said.
400	00:21:03	00:21:05	That was before she turned up dead.
401	00:21:06	00:21:07	And I'm not saying he did it, and Lori...
402	00:21:07	00:21:10	she never said anything.
403	00:21:11	00:21:13	It's just sometimes, um...
404	00:21:14	00:21:15	he can get rough.
405	00:21:17	00:21:21	And you know this because...?
406	00:21:24	00:21:26	You were the other woman.
407	00:21:26	00:21:28	One of them.
408	00:21:28	00:21:30	I'm not proud of it.
409	00:21:30	00:21:32	Did Mark get rough with you?
410	00:21:33	00:21:36	That's why I ended it.
411	00:21:44	00:21:45	You started without me.
412	00:21:46	00:21:48	Actually, I finished without you. Take a look.
413	00:21:49	00:21:50	Carpet's black.
414	00:21:51	00:21:52	Fibers on the vic's clothing were red.
415	00:21:52	00:21:55	Obviously, we can rule out this car.
416	00:21:56	00:22:00	I don't mean to pry, but you want to talk about what happened with you and Ecklie?
417	00:22:00	00:22:02	Not really.
418	00:22:02	00:22:06	I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm a good listener.
419	00:22:07	00:22:10	I blew up at Ecklie.
420	00:22:10	00:22:12	It was very unprofessional.
421	00:22:12	00:22:16	And very satisfying, and now I'm moving on.
422	00:22:18	00:22:19	Thanks for asking.
423	00:22:22	00:22:27	Joey just fell asleep, so please, keep your voices down.
424	00:22:27	00:22:29	All we need is a sample of baby powder.
425	00:22:36	00:22:38	This is Berber carpet, isn't it?
426	00:22:38	00:22:41	Yeah, Lori thought it'd be good for a boy's room.
427	00:22:44	00:22:46	I'd like to take a small sample.
428	00:22:46	00:22:48	What's going on?
429	00:22:48	00:22:50	Just collecting evidence.
430	00:22:50	00:22:51	You're coming after me?
431	00:22:52	00:22:57	Because I've cooperated. I've let you swab my mouth and let you take my prints.
432	00:22:58	00:23:00	I love my wife. I miss her.
433	00:23:15	00:23:18	DNA from Lori's shirt came back.
434	00:23:18	00:23:20	It matches her husband.
435	00:23:20	00:23:21	That could be probative.
436	00:23:21	00:23:24	Or casual transfer unrelated to the case.
437	00:23:24	00:23:27	I also picked up your trace results.
438	00:23:29	00:23:35	Baby powder on Lori's palms is consistent with the baby powder we found at the Kymans' residence.
439	00:23:35	00:23:39	According to her girlfriend, Lori washed her hands at the club.
440	00:23:39	00:23:43	Which suggests that Lori came home before she was killed.
441	00:23:43	00:23:45	Which contradicts the husband's account.
442	00:23:45	00:23:49	I hate to state the obvious, but maybe the husband is lying.
443	00:23:49	00:23:53	All right, well, let's say she came home first.
444	00:24:05	00:24:08	Mark killed her, drove her out to Sutor, and dumped the body.
445	00:24:09	00:24:17	One problem. Mark doesn't have a car and the carpet fibers we found on Lori's clothing are inconsistent with her Lexus.
446	00:24:17	00:24:21	Or, maybe Lori came home, she and Mark had a fight.
447	00:24:21	00:24:23	Maybe she found out he was fooling around again.
448	00:24:23	00:24:26	She takes off, drives around.
449	00:24:26	00:24:27	Tire eventually goes flat.
450	00:24:27	00:24:31	She pulls over to the side of the road and a stranger comes along and abducts her.
451	00:24:33	00:24:35	A stranger driving a Bentley?
452	00:24:35	00:24:40	Hey, the rich are just as deviant as the poor.
453	00:25:02	00:25:04	Hey, Dawson.
454	00:25:04	00:25:05	Yo.
455	00:25:05	00:25:07	Any progress on those bullets?
456	00:25:07	00:25:09	Well, the copper jacket came from your vic's rifle there.
457	00:25:09	00:25:12	A .30‐caliber Winchester, Model 70.
458	00:25:12	00:25:13	What about the fatal bullet?
459	00:25:13	00:25:16	That came from a .357 Magnum revolver.
460	00:25:17	00:25:18	A .357?
461	00:25:18	00:25:23	Ran the baby through IBIS the gun was used in a '98 robbery.
462	00:25:23	00:25:29	The suspect was arrested but released on insufficient evidence and the gun was returned.
463	00:25:29	00:25:30	You got a name for him?
464	00:25:30	00:25:33	Aaron Colite, from Henderson.
465	00:25:33	00:25:36	Why don't you just stand up by the counter, sir?
466	00:25:37	00:25:41	Here's your warrant that we have here for your .357 Magnum revolver.
467	00:25:41	00:25:44	We know you once used it in a '98 robbery.
468	00:25:44	00:25:48	Serial number ML5684.
469	00:25:48	00:25:49	We don't want you to get it.
470	00:25:49	00:25:51	Why don't you just point and show us where it is.
471	00:25:51	00:25:52	What's this about?
472	00:25:52	00:25:54	Where's the gun, sir?
473	00:25:57	00:25:58	Right under the TV.
474	00:26:07	00:26:12	Okay, Mr. Colite, this gun is going into evidence.
475	00:26:12	00:26:14	Look, I was cleared in that robbery years ago.
476	00:26:14	00:26:18	Well, someone killed a Kodiak bear up in the Black Mountains the day before yesterday.
477	00:26:19	00:26:21	You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
478	00:26:21	00:26:24	Yeah, I did. I killed it.
479	00:26:24	00:26:26	Excuse me?
480	00:26:26	00:26:28	I killed it.
481	00:26:28	00:26:31	Look, I was... I was out hunting.
482	00:26:31	00:26:33	Help!
483	00:26:33	00:26:34	Help me!
484	00:26:34	00:26:35	Stop! Help!
485	00:26:35	00:26:36	Help me! Help!
486	00:26:36	00:26:38	Help!
487	00:26:40	00:26:44	By the time I shot the bear, the guy was already dead.
488	00:26:45	00:26:47	You mind if I have a look around?
489	00:26:47	00:26:49	Yeah, I do, actually.
490	00:26:49	00:26:51	You just admitted a felony of killing a bear.
491	00:26:51	00:26:52	Why didn't you report it?
492	00:26:53	00:26:56	I've been through the wringer with you guys once before.
493	00:26:56	00:26:58	I figured a guy was dead.
494	00:26:58	00:27:00	There was nothing I could do about it.
495	00:27:00	00:27:03	I took off.
496	00:27:05	00:27:06	Look, I've got a hunting license with tags.
497	00:27:06	00:27:07	I was out hunting deer.
498	00:27:07	00:27:10	Tried to save a guy's life.
499	00:27:10	00:27:11	That's it.
500	00:27:11	00:27:12	Whoa, Mr. Colite.
501	00:27:12	00:27:16	I just have one more question for you.
502	00:27:16	00:27:21	How long have you been storing gallbladders with your ice cream?
503	00:27:21	00:27:24	It ain't illegal to cut up a dead animal as long as it's already dead. That's the law.
504	00:27:24	00:27:26	Could you lift your pants leg for me, please, sir?
505	00:27:27	00:27:28	For what?
506	00:27:28	00:27:31	Someone snagged their pant leg on a tree, probably cut themselves.
507	00:27:31	00:27:33	I wanted to see if it was you.
508	00:27:37	00:27:39	Take a look.
509	00:27:39	00:27:40	Wasn't me.
510	00:27:42	00:27:45	So Robbins sent the bear's blood to Tox.
511	00:27:45	00:27:49	It turns out there were elevated levels of Ketamine in its system.
512	00:27:49	00:27:50	Barbiturates?
513	00:27:50	00:27:52	Yeah.
514	00:27:52	00:27:54	I think I know what's going on here, Catherine.
515	00:28:00	00:28:02	They're called canned hunts.
516	00:28:03	00:28:04	Going on all over the country.
517	00:28:04	00:28:06	I'm sorry.
518	00:28:06	00:28:08	There's just no sport in that.
519	00:28:08	00:28:09	It's just sick.
520	00:28:09	00:28:09	Well, you got that right.
521	00:28:09	00:28:12	Point is, you don't have to go to Africa to hunt wild game anymore.
522	00:28:12	00:28:15	If you've got the money, Africa comes to you.
523	00:28:15	00:28:17	And they drug the animals?
524	00:28:17	00:28:19	To guarantee a kill, yeah.
525	00:28:19	00:28:23	But in our case, both the hunter and the prey ended up dead.
526	00:28:23	00:28:25	Something went wrong.
527	00:28:26	00:28:29	Hey.
528	00:28:29	00:28:30	Oh, filling out reports?
529	00:28:31	00:28:33	They tell me it's my job.
530	00:28:34	00:28:35	You doing okay?
531	00:28:36	00:28:38	Yeah.
532	00:28:39	00:28:40	Thanks.
533	00:28:40	00:28:43	I, uh, did a DMV search.
534	00:28:43	00:28:47	There are only five Bentleys with red interior registered in Clark County.
535	00:28:47	00:28:48	Two are leased.
536	00:28:48	00:28:50	Two are privately owned.
537	00:28:50	00:28:52	I ran the ROs. Nothing suspicious.
538	00:28:52	00:28:53	PD is following up.
539	00:28:53	00:28:54	What about the fifth one?
540	00:28:54	00:28:58	Well, that one is owned by a boutique rental car agency.
541	00:28:58	00:28:59	I subpoenaed the rental history.
542	00:28:59	00:29:03	Diane Hoyt, Lori's mother, had the car for the last two weeks.
543	00:29:03	00:29:06	She returned it the day after Lori disappeared.
544	00:29:06	00:29:08	Where is it now?
545	00:29:08	00:29:13	If you've added up every cent I've made in my entire life, I still wouldn't be able to afford half this car.
546	00:29:13	00:29:14	Yeah, but why would you want it?
547	00:29:14	00:29:16	The insurance premiums are sky‐high.
548	00:29:16	00:29:18	Not to mention theft, scratches.
549	00:29:18	00:29:19	It's art.
550	00:29:19	00:29:22	And I'd have every girl in the neighborhood after me.
551	00:29:22	00:29:24	Not when they saw your apartment.
552	00:29:24	00:29:25	You've been to Greg's apartment?
553	00:29:25	00:29:27	Who hasn't?
554	00:29:28	00:29:29	Red carpet.
555	00:29:30	00:29:31	Same as the interior.
556	00:29:31	00:29:33	Recently vacuumed.
557	00:29:33	00:29:35	We got better vacuums.
558	00:30:15	00:30:20	You found pods in the victim's hair, right?
559	00:30:25	00:30:27	Same shape, size, color.
560	00:30:28	00:30:31	Too bad we can't ID this pod and tie it to that tree.
561	00:30:31	00:30:32	Who says we can't?
562	00:30:32	00:30:35	Plant DNA is no different than human DNA.
563	00:30:35	00:30:37	In fact, a plant genome is larger.
564	00:30:37	00:30:38	I'm on it.
565	00:30:38	00:30:43	If we can prove the pod came from that dump site, you know what that means?
566	00:30:43	00:30:45	Lori's mother is a viable suspect.
567	00:31:33	00:31:36	Why are you asking my client about a rental car?
568	00:31:36	00:31:40	It may be probative to our investigation of her daughter's death.
569	00:31:40	00:31:41	I'll answer anything they want.
570	00:31:41	00:31:44	I backed my car into a telephone pole.
571	00:31:45	00:31:46	So I put it in the shop.
572	00:31:46	00:31:47	I had to rent a car.
573	00:31:48	00:31:50	At a grand a day, a Bentley's a little extravagant.
574	00:31:50	00:31:52	I mean, I usually rent a Taurus.
575	00:31:53	00:31:55	It's a fantasy car.
576	00:31:55	00:31:58	Ever since Amy got hers, I've wanted one, so I splurged.
577	00:31:59	00:32:00	Was the vehicle ever out of your possession?
578	00:32:01	00:32:03	You mean, did I let anybody drive it?
579	00:32:03	00:32:04	That's what I mean, yeah.
580	00:32:04	00:32:06	Lori and Mark both did.
581	00:32:06	00:32:08	But I was always with them.
582	00:32:08	00:32:11	Ms. Hoyt, did you drive your car to Sutor, Nevada?
583	00:32:11	00:32:12	No.
584	00:32:13	00:32:15	Where are you going with this?
585	00:32:15	00:32:20	On the hood of the vehicle, which affirmatively matched the plant material we found in Lori's hair.
586	00:32:20	00:32:22	All of which came from the same tree in Sutor.
587	00:32:22	00:32:26	Okay, but my client returned the Bentley the day before yesterday.
588	00:32:26	00:32:31	It was washed and then rented again, so perhaps that individual drove through Sutor on his or her way out of town.
589	00:32:31	00:32:36	Or, as you know, that pod could be weeks or months old.
590	00:32:36	00:32:39	We also collected a number of errant hairs from the vehicle.
591	00:32:39	00:32:44	Several are consistent with Mark and Lori's DNA and also Joey's, but not yours.
592	00:32:44	00:32:45	Okay, I'm sorry.
593	00:32:45	00:32:48	You don't have a DNA sample of my client's for comparison purposes.
594	00:32:48	00:32:50	No, but we have her daughter's.
595	00:32:50	00:32:53	You're not Lori's biological mother, are you?
596	00:32:53	00:32:55	I'm her stepmom.
597	00:32:55	00:32:57	That's not a secret.
598	00:32:58	00:33:00	I couldn't have children of my own.
599	00:33:00	00:33:06	Ever since Lori's father died a few months ago, she's all I had.
600	00:33:06	00:33:08	Look, Mark is devastated.
601	00:33:08	00:33:10	I really should get back to my grandson.
602	00:33:10	00:33:11	Before you go, could we take a DNA sample?
603	00:33:11	00:33:12	You do not have to do that.
604	00:33:13	00:33:15	Yeah, but if she has nothing to hide, it's no big deal.
605	00:33:15	00:33:16	Could you open your mouth?
606	00:33:16	00:33:17	All right, that's it.
607	00:33:17	00:33:19	We're finished here. Let's go.
608	00:33:24	00:33:25	What are you thinking?
609	00:33:27	00:33:31	We have nothing to arrest her on.
610	00:33:33	00:33:38	And we have unexplained evidence placing Lori back at the house after her night out.
611	00:33:38	00:33:39	That's why I like the husband.
612	00:33:39	00:33:40	Maybe they're in it together.
613	00:33:41	00:33:48	Well, when two people of the opposite sex conspire to kill one of their partners, sex or money is almost always involved.
614	00:33:48	00:33:51	Now, Lori's friend, Amy, did say Mark was a player.
615	00:33:51	00:33:53	Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
616	00:33:53	00:34:00	I had this boyfriend back in college, and when he got his first Harley, well, let's just say we sat face‐to‐face and went for a ride.
617	00:34:00	00:34:02	A Bentley is a lot more comfortable than a bike.
618	00:34:45	00:34:53	Document was forged by taking an official license issued by the Department of Agriculture and scraping away the top layer of information.
619	00:34:53	00:34:57	Document was then photocopied, and the bogus info was typed in.
620	00:34:57	00:34:59	Take a look.
621	00:35:00	00:35:01	Mm‐hmm.
622	00:35:01	00:35:05	A simple forgery, but it doesn't get us any closer to our suspect.
623	00:35:05	00:35:06	Actually, it does.
624	00:35:06	00:35:17	See, a couple years back, some photocopier companies started imbedding their machines with serial numbers less than a millimeter in size and visible only under a blue LED light.
625	00:35:17	00:35:18	Of course.
626	00:35:24	00:35:26	I see it.
627	00:35:26	00:35:27	It's as good as fingerprint.
628	00:35:28	00:35:30	Thanks.
629	00:35:36	00:35:40	And you think the broker's documentation was forged here on my copier?
630	00:35:40	00:35:41	We know it was.
631	00:35:41	00:35:45	Mr. Tracy, tell us about canned hunts.
632	00:35:45	00:35:50	Uh, a wild animal is released into a controlled area where a hunter pays a fee to kill it.
633	00:35:50	00:35:53	The promoters guarantee a trophy, so no kill, no pay.
634	00:35:54	00:35:56	They're illegal in Nevada.
635	00:35:56	00:35:57	Is that what happened to my bear?
636	00:35:57	00:35:59	Aaron Colite worked here, right?
637	00:36:01	00:36:02	Yeah. Maintenance.
638	00:36:02	00:36:03	You fired him?
639	00:36:03	00:36:04	About six months ago.
640	00:36:05	00:36:07	We let a lot people go. Cutbacks.
641	00:36:07	00:36:09	Well, the evidence places Aaron at the crime scene.
642	00:36:09	00:36:14	Wait, so you're thinking he forged the broker's document and took Tippy under false pretenses?
643	00:36:14	00:36:16	No. We spoke to your distributor.
644	00:36:16	00:36:19	Your copy machine was only installed two months ago.
645	00:36:19	00:36:22	We think you created the false document.
646	00:36:22	00:36:27	We suspect that Aaron figured out a way to make a buck, and he asked for your help.
647	00:36:27	00:36:30	So Aaron organizes this canned hunt.
648	00:36:30	00:36:33	A few days ago, you guys meet up with Rod Hollis up at Lake Mead.
649	00:36:33	00:36:35	Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod!
650	00:36:36	00:36:37	Right there.
651	00:36:37	00:36:38	You see him?
652	00:36:50	00:36:51	Yes!
653	00:36:52	00:36:52	I got him!
654	00:36:52	00:36:54	Yep, you got him.
655	00:36:54	00:37:00	Mr. Hollis probably thought that he had killed the bear, and he raced over to claim his trophy.
656	00:37:07	00:37:09	Help! Help! Help me!
657	00:37:09	00:37:11	Help!
658	00:37:12	00:37:14	His shot only stunned the bear.
659	00:37:14	00:37:16	It was Aaron's shot that killed it.
660	00:37:17	00:37:19	You can't prove I was there.
661	00:37:19	00:37:21	Would you lift up your pants legs, please, sir?
662	00:37:21	00:37:22	What?
663	00:37:22	00:37:24	I have the judge on speed dial.
664	00:37:24	00:37:26	You want to save me some time here?
665	00:37:33	00:37:35	Help! Help! Help me!
666	00:37:38	00:37:39	I got this gardening.
667	00:37:40	00:37:43	We subpoenaed Aaron's bank records.
668	00:37:43	00:37:47	Rod Hollis sent Aaron a check for $16,000.
669	00:37:47	00:37:50	Aaron sent you a check for $8,000.
670	00:37:50	00:37:52	That's a 50‐50 split.
671	00:37:52	00:37:56	You're looking at grand larceny and obtaining property under false pretenses.
672	00:37:58	00:37:59	That's about 20 years right there.
673	00:38:02	00:38:04	second degree murder...
674	00:38:07	00:38:09	...for the death of the hunter.
675	00:38:12	00:38:18	We found your client's semen mixed with a vaginal contribution from Diane Hoyt in the back of her rental car.
676	00:38:18	00:38:21	You said you had nothing to do with Lori's murder.
677	00:38:21	00:38:22	Would you like to revise that statement?
678	00:38:22	00:38:24	No.
679	00:38:24	00:38:28	I met Diane, uh, two weeks ago at Rain.
680	00:38:28	00:38:33	Banged the cougar that night, but I had no idea she was anybody's mother.
681	00:38:33	00:38:35	So you haven't spoken to her since?
682	00:38:35	00:38:38	Well, that's the whole point of banging a cougar‐‐ you never got to see 'em again.
683	00:38:38	00:38:39	One lie after another.
684	00:38:40	00:38:43	Are you questioning my client's veracity?
685	00:38:43	00:38:45	These are your client's cell phone records.
686	00:38:45	00:38:47	Semen in the car was enough to get a warrant.
687	00:38:47	00:38:54	On the night that Lori was murdered, he called Ms. Hoyt on her cell phone 23 p. m.
688	00:38:54	00:38:56	No, I don't know him.
689	00:38:57	00:38:59	You've never seen or spoken to this man?
690	00:38:59	00:39:01	No, not that I remember.
691	00:39:01	00:39:03	Hmm.
692	00:39:03	00:39:06	Do you remember the men you have sex with?
693	00:39:06	00:39:07	Ms. Curtis, that is uncalled for.
694	00:39:07	00:39:09	Here's the deal.
695	00:39:09	00:39:11	00.
696	00:39:11	00:39:16	By your client's own admission, he followed her for about 20 minutes, waiting for the tire to go flat.
697	00:39:16	00:39:19	When it didn't, you called her mother.
698	00:39:20	00:39:21	It was all a setup.
699	00:39:21	00:39:26	Brad was going to strike up a conversation with Lori at the club, and on her way home, abduct her.
700	00:39:26	00:39:31	And then, one or both of you were going to kill her.
701	00:39:34	00:39:38	But when you got his call... you went to Plan B.
702	00:39:38	00:39:42	I left Lori's house, drove home and went to bed.
703	00:39:42	00:39:44	You never left.
704	00:39:44	00:39:48	Mark fell asleep in the living room, and you waited for Lori to come home.
705	00:39:57	00:40:02	Lori's body was too heavy for you to carry, so you called for help...
706	00:40:02	00:40:04	on Mark and Lori's phone.
707	00:40:04	00:40:08	You got her call 17 a. m.
708	00:40:08	00:40:14	Coroner puts Lori's death 00 and 1 Well, which means I didn't kill her, like I told you.
709	00:40:14	00:40:15	Brad, be quiet.
710	00:40:15	00:40:21	Oh, I never thought you did kill her, but you did help get rid of the body, and that is conspiracy after the fact.
711	00:40:21	00:40:29	Now, Mark would've heard something, and if he's claiming he didn't, I'd be looking at him. The living room's at the other end of the house.
712	00:40:29	00:40:30	He was asleep.
713	00:40:30	00:40:31	Prove it.
714	00:40:32	00:40:33	I don't need to.
715	00:40:33	00:40:38	We found something of Lori's her skin.
716	00:40:47	00:40:48	Your client's on record.
717	00:40:49	00:40:51	The vehicle was never out of her possession.
718	00:40:51	00:40:57	You drove back to the house, picked up Lori's Lexus, drove back into town.
719	00:40:57	00:40:59	Tire went flat off Boulder Highway.
720	00:40:59	00:41:01	You can't prove that.
721	00:41:01	00:41:04	When we suspected Brad's involvement, we printed the interior of the Lexus.
722	00:41:04	00:41:06	Your prints are on the steering wheel.
723	00:41:11	00:41:13	Is there a deal to be made?
724	00:41:14	00:41:17	Why did Diane Hoyt want Lori dead?
725	00:41:17	00:41:19	I don't know.
726	00:41:21	00:41:24	The lady paid me 2,000 bucks.
727	00:41:24	00:41:28	Um... said she was having a fight with her daughter and wanted to make good...
728	00:41:28	00:41:32	um, only Lori wouldn't return her calls, so it was my job to get 'em together.
729	00:41:35	00:41:39	When she called me and asked me for my help later that night, she said she'd pay me $2,000 more.
730	00:41:44	00:41:46	I know why she did it.
731	00:41:46	00:41:49	While you two were at PD, I called the family lawyer.
732	00:41:49	00:41:51	He faxed over a copy of Lori's father's trust.
733	00:41:52	00:41:54	Estate's worth $50 million.
734	00:41:54	00:41:56	He left it all to Lori?
735	00:41:56	00:41:57	No, to her son.
736	00:41:57	00:42:01	Lori was the trustee with a stipend of $2.5 mil a year.
737	00:42:01	00:42:04	If anything were to happen to Lori, guess who takes her place?
738	00:42:04	00:42:06	Her stepmom.
739	00:42:06	00:42:07	Yup.
740	00:42:09	00:42:12	Listen, you guys, I'll catch up later.
741	00:42:14	00:42:18	Hmm. She's fitting in pretty well, huh?
742	00:42:25	00:42:29	You got a minute?
743	00:42:29	00:42:31	Sure.
744	00:42:33	00:42:36	You did a nice job on the case.
745	00:42:36	00:42:37	I, uh...
746	00:42:38	00:42:42	I just wanted you to know that I've enjoyed working with you.
747	00:42:45	00:42:47	Well, I've enjoyed working with you as well.
748	00:42:47	00:42:51	No, it's time I made a change.
749	00:42:51	00:42:54	I don't like the direction the lab's headed.
750	00:42:56	00:42:57	You mean Ecklie?
751	00:42:57	00:43:00	You can't pay any attention to him.
752	00:43:00	00:43:03	No, you got a good team, but I was a supervisor.
753	00:43:03	00:43:06	My demotion was undeserved, and every day I'm here, I'm reminded of that.
754	00:43:10	00:43:12	What?
755	00:43:13	00:43:22	Well, someone once said, What we are never changes, but who we are... never stops changing.
756	00:43:24	00:43:27	Let's have dinner, shall we?
