0	00:00:01	00:00:02	Do not adjust your radios.
1	00:00:02	00:00:04	That roar you hear in the distance is real.
2	00:00:04	00:00:08	Because we're broadcasting live from the middle of the merciless Mojave.
3	00:00:08	00:00:13	This, ladies and gentlemen, is the Desert Blast 200 Off-Road Championships.
4	00:01:00	00:01:03	Boss, we got something gnarly out here.
5	00:01:07	00:01:09	I never heard of anything like this.
6	00:01:09	00:01:10	Crashes, sure, but...
7	00:01:10	00:01:14	this is downright Twilight Zone.
8	00:01:17	00:01:19	Whoo!
9	00:01:19	00:01:20	You're not gonna want to see this, pal.
10	00:01:20	00:01:24	You guys got here quick. Might be a trophy in it for ya.
11	00:01:24	00:01:25	This is Bo Martin the race manager.
12	00:01:25	00:01:26	Gentlemen. Sir.
13	00:01:26	00:01:30	Whose race managed to turn into a crime scene.
14	00:01:30	00:01:32	We're not playing Frogger out here, are we?
15	00:01:32	00:01:33	No, no, the race has been stopped.
16	00:01:33	00:01:37	Jimmy Delton over there, he's the one spotted the wreck.
17	00:01:37	00:01:38	Big ol' blaze.
18	00:01:38	00:01:41	Whoo. Nasty.
19	00:01:43	00:01:44	So, uh...
20	00:01:44	00:01:47	so why are we here, Lou?
21	00:01:47	00:01:48	Where's the crime part?
22	00:01:48	00:01:51	Call it a mystery. Definitely suspicious.
23	00:01:51	00:01:54	When this truck started the race, there were two people in it.
24	00:01:54	00:01:55	Saw for myself.
25	00:01:55	00:01:58	It was a driver and a co-driver.
26	00:01:58	00:02:00	The driver's a Crispy Critter.
27	00:02:00	00:02:03	In his own personal hell-on-wheels.
28	00:02:03	00:02:04	And the co-driver?
29	00:02:06	00:02:07	Dust in the wind. Okay.
30	00:02:07	00:02:09	So, it's not just a crash site.
31	00:02:09	00:02:12	No. It's an 80-mile-an-hour missing persons case.
32	00:02:12	00:02:13	Well...
33	00:02:13	00:02:15	On your mark, get set, go.
34	00:02:51	00:02:52	Live fast, die young.
35	00:02:52	00:02:53	Not me.
36	00:02:53	00:02:56	The wife's pushing for a minivan.
37	00:02:56	00:02:58	Bugging me about safety ratings and...
38	00:02:58	00:03:00	car seat compatibility.
39	00:03:00	00:03:01	So, do you have some news to share?
40	00:03:01	00:03:04	No, no, it's still hypothetical. But hypothetically...
41	00:03:04	00:03:08	I don't want my kid's first impression of his dad to be some minivan- driving geek.
42	00:03:08	00:03:12	What are you worried about? Your kid's still gonna think you're the coolest guy on the planet.
43	00:03:12	00:03:17	That is till Uncle Nicky comes over and picks him up in a GT500.
44	00:03:17	00:03:19	Thanks, man. You're welcome.
45	00:03:19	00:03:22	Race Manager is getting the event records, the name of the driver and the co-driver.
46	00:03:22	00:03:26	The surrounding area's already been canvassed, but there's no sign of the co-driver.
47	00:03:26	00:03:28	Hmm. Maybe he bailed at some earlier point.
48	00:03:28	00:03:29	I've had dates end that way.
49	00:03:29	00:03:34	Argue, pull over, slam the door, and sulk home to watch The Notebook.
50	00:03:34	00:03:36	The Notebook? Really?
51	00:03:38	00:03:39	What's that?
52	00:03:44	00:03:47	Same logo as the driver.
53	00:03:47	00:03:49	Co-driver's helmet.
54	00:03:49	00:03:51	All right. Puts him at the scene of the wreck.
55	00:03:51	00:03:55	Truck comes flying over this jump...
56	00:03:55	00:03:59	blows the landing, hits nose first...
57	00:03:59	00:04:01	and rolls.
58	00:04:01	00:04:03	Maybe the fuel tank ruptured on impact.
59	00:04:03	00:04:05	Spark. Boom.
60	00:04:05	00:04:07	Well, there's something over here.
61	00:04:10	00:04:13	Fiberglass from the wreck.
62	00:04:15	00:04:18	It looks like somebody drove right over it.
63	00:04:20	00:04:23	Wasn't that guy, Jimmy Delton. He called it in.
64	00:04:23	00:04:26	Besides, he's not sporting tires with this pattern.
65	00:04:27	00:04:29	Good eyes, Brody.
66	00:04:30	00:04:32	So...
67	00:04:32	00:04:35	somebody drives by a flaming wreck with loss of life, doesn't stop?
68	00:04:35	00:04:37	Doesn't even radio for help?
69	00:04:37	00:04:39	That's intense.
70	00:04:39	00:04:42	I thought this was just a bunch of gearheads having fun, not...
71	00:04:42	00:04:44	Death Race 2012.
72	00:04:44	00:04:46	Let's circle out.
73	00:04:46	00:04:48	Maybe we can reconstruct the crash.
74	00:05:16	00:05:19	You found a piece of the fancy fuel tank, too? Yeah.
75	00:05:19	00:05:21	Even better...
76	00:05:21	00:05:22	I think this possibly caused the explosion.
77	00:05:22	00:05:25	A suspension link arrow to the heart of it.
78	00:05:25	00:05:27	Reckless speeds over brutal terrain.
79	00:05:27	00:05:29	There's no surprise that something gives.
80	00:05:32	00:05:34	Ka-boom.
81	00:05:37	00:05:38	I got the records here.
82	00:05:41	00:05:44	Truck was entered by a team named A Pharaoh's Motorists.
83	00:05:44	00:05:47	Driver, co-driver, Tim, Paul White.
84	00:05:47	00:05:49	Team captain, Doug White.
85	00:05:49	00:05:50	So are these guys brothers, or what?
86	00:05:50	00:05:52	I guess.
87	00:05:52	00:05:53	I don't know. I asked around, nobody knew 'em.
88	00:05:53	00:05:55	Team captain's not answering his cell, so...
89	00:05:55	00:05:57	Anybody check their pit?
90	00:05:57	00:06:01	No. Bit of a drive, but I could lead you there.
91	00:06:01	00:06:02	Yeah, let's do it.
92	00:06:08	00:06:09	Slow down in the pit.
93	00:06:10	00:06:12	Okay...
94	00:06:12	00:06:14	they are right over...
95	00:06:15	00:06:17	Now this is bizarre.
96	00:06:17	00:06:18	What is?
97	00:06:18	00:06:21	These Pharaoh's Motorists, they just picked up and left.
98	00:06:21	00:06:23	Looks like in a hurry, too.
99	00:06:23	00:06:28	So the driver's dead, the co-driver, the team captain, and the trailer are now all missing?
100	00:06:28	00:06:30	That's what it looks like.
101	00:06:31	00:06:32	Doesn't get much stranger than that.
102	00:06:38	00:06:43	Lose your truck, your life, shotgun-riding buddy runs off-- sounds like a country song.
103	00:06:43	00:06:46	Yeah, and our man in black also has a secret.
104	00:06:46	00:06:50	Vartann ran the names and license numbers of this guy and his teammates...
105	00:06:50	00:06:51	they're phony.
106	00:06:51	00:06:53	Aliases? Mm-hmm.
107	00:06:53	00:06:54	Weird.
108	00:06:54	00:06:56	Hey, take a look at this.
109	00:06:56	00:06:57	Is that blood?
110	00:06:57	00:06:59	No.
111	00:06:59	00:07:01	I think that's ink. Yeah, it's still tacky.
112	00:07:01	00:07:08	Looks like a silk screen design that melted from the truck fire, then transferred to the inside of the fire suit.
113	00:07:08	00:07:10	Like a T-shirt iron-on.
114	00:07:10	00:07:14	You know, it looks like it could be a logo that's been flipped and smeared.
115	00:07:14	00:07:16	Yeah, could help us get an I.D.
116	00:07:16	00:07:18	Let's iron out the iron-on.
117	00:07:20	00:07:24	Our mystery race team didn't leave us much to go on here.
118	00:07:24	00:07:25	Sorry, boys.
119	00:07:25	00:07:27	(engine revs) Oh, man.
120	00:07:31	00:07:34	Bo, you kidding me with this?
121	00:07:34	00:07:36	Some rookie bends his fender and the whole race is postponed?
122	00:07:36	00:07:37	It was a little bit more than a bent fender, ma'am.
123	00:07:37	00:07:39	I was winning the damn thing.
124	00:07:39	00:07:41	I hit the 50-mile mark in record time.
125	00:07:41	00:07:46	Well, maybe you can help us out then, Ms.-- Uh, Kathy Veck. She's the CEO of Veck Oil.
126	00:07:46	00:07:52	She's one of our premier racers and a very generous sponsor. Hitch a former on the last one, Bo. I didn't fly from Houston to have my truck in park.
127	00:07:52	00:07:58	Ms. Veck, the accident that we're investigating happened at around the 47-mile marker.
128	00:07:58	00:07:59	You didn't happen to see anything, did you?
129	00:07:59	00:08:02	I-It would've been a fly in my rearview at the pace I was hauling.
130	00:08:02	00:08:04	Well, maybe your co-pilot saw something?
131	00:08:04	00:08:05	It's not a plane, okay?
132	00:08:05	00:08:10	And I drive alone. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to reaming this sorry son of a bitch.
133	00:08:10	00:08:11	Yes, ma'am. Let's go.
134	00:08:11	00:08:12	Been a pleasure.
135	00:08:13	00:08:21	In life, he may have been a weekend road warrior, but in cause of death he joins some of racing's greats.
136	00:08:21	00:08:25	Blood and cerebrospinal fluid excreted from his ear suggest C.O.D.
137	00:08:25	00:08:28	was a basal skull fracture.
138	00:08:28	00:08:31	Same way Earnhardt and other champions met their finish line.
139	00:08:31	00:08:35	When a driver's body is strapped in, but his head is free...
140	00:08:35	00:08:40	the crash transfers the vehicle's momentum to the head, driving it forward.
141	00:08:40	00:08:42	The neck strains to hold the head back.
142	00:08:42	00:08:50	Tension fractures the base of the skull, severing blood vessels near the spinal cord, resulting in massive hemorrhaging.
143	00:08:50	00:08:53	So he was dead before the fire got to him.
144	00:08:53	00:08:57	Yeah, but perhaps his fate was fated by biology.
145	00:08:57	00:08:59	What do you mean, Doc?
146	00:08:59	00:09:13	The odd growths on his eyelids and in his brain, they present like Urbach-Wiethe disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes waxy obstructions to grow throughout the body.
147	00:09:13	00:09:15	Wow. That sounds horrifying.
148	00:09:15	00:09:16	Not to him.
149	00:09:16	00:09:20	In our young man's case, the growths surround the amygdala.
150	00:09:20	00:09:24	The region of the brain controlling memory and emotional response.
151	00:09:24	00:09:31	I read a study where obstructions of the amygdala resulted in a patient being absolutely fearless.
152	00:09:31	00:09:34	Not a bad trade for a guy with a need for speed.
153	00:09:34	00:09:36	Except when it gets you killed.
154	00:09:38	00:09:40	Okay, so I'll do it at your place tonight.
155	00:09:40	00:09:43	And, um, I'll call you if I'm gonna be late.
156	00:09:43	00:09:46	Oh, there is no way that I would ever let you go to sleep.
157	00:09:49	00:09:51	Oh, my goodness.
158	00:09:51	00:09:52	Can I call you back?
159	00:09:52	00:09:54	Oh, I'm so sorry.
160	00:09:54	00:09:56	That is really embarrassing. Don't be embarrassed.
161	00:09:56	00:09:59	I'm just glad someone around here is having a personal life.
162	00:09:59	00:10:01	Really?
163	00:10:01	00:10:03	Aren't you going out with Greg?
164	00:10:03	00:10:04	Oh, no. (chuckles)
165	00:10:04	00:10:06	Nick?
166	00:10:06	00:10:07	(sighs) No.
167	00:10:07	00:10:09	You're with Hodges.
168	00:10:09	00:10:10	No.
169	00:10:12	00:10:15	So that phone call, that was...
170	00:10:15	00:10:17	Detective Moreno?
171	00:10:17	00:10:19	Oh, that is a definite yes.
172	00:10:20	00:10:22	All right then.
173	00:10:22	00:10:28	Well, since we're on the subject of men, what do you say we try and identify Racer X?
174	00:10:31	00:10:34	So we start by cleaning up the smeared logo.
175	00:10:36	00:10:40	Then apply edge detection.
176	00:10:43	00:10:45	It's military.
177	00:10:45	00:10:47	Okay, let's see if he's in that battalion.
178	00:10:53	00:10:56	Top row, second from the right.
179	00:10:56	00:10:58	Looks like our vic.
180	00:10:58	00:11:00	The dead driver's name is Jack Breslin.
181	00:11:00	00:11:03	25, from Mesquite. Served in Iraq.
182	00:11:03	00:11:05	Two tours. Bronze Star.
183	00:11:05	00:11:07	He's a regular war hero.
184	00:11:07	00:11:09	Yeah, we're trying to locate his next of kin.
185	00:11:09	00:11:11	But we did locate his apartment.
186	00:11:11	00:11:13	Find anything? Uh, not in the apartment.
187	00:11:13	00:11:16	But we were able to find a very interesting voice mail.
188	00:11:16	00:11:19	Jack, listen, they're onto us.
189	00:11:19	00:11:22	We're not going to be able to pull this off. Walk away.
190	00:11:22	00:11:23	Don't get into that truck.
191	00:11:23	00:11:25	Sorry, man.
192	00:11:25	00:11:26	Ran a trace.
193	00:11:26	00:11:28	Call came from a disposable phone.
194	00:11:28	00:11:32	According to the phone company's server, this was the last message left on Breslin's voice mail.
195	00:11:32	00:11:34	I'm betting he never got it.
196	00:11:39	00:11:41	What are you doing, homework?
197	00:11:41	00:11:45	You know I've been studying for my criminalistics certification.
198	00:11:45	00:11:52	I never really liked math in school, but you throw in a little ballistics, some TNT, bit of blood-- it's pretty cool.
199	00:11:52	00:11:55	Cool. But shouldn't you be doing that on your own time?
200	00:11:55	00:11:59	I'm actually working the case.
201	00:11:59	00:12:01	And I think that we're looking at it all wrong.
202	00:12:01	00:12:03	Cite your source.
203	00:12:03	00:12:05	The debris field.
204	00:12:05	00:12:09	It's way too big for an accidental explosion, like you theorized.
205	00:12:09	00:12:10	No offense.
206	00:12:10	00:12:13	None taken... if you're right.
207	00:12:13	00:12:21	Well, based on the size and direction of impact to the fuel tank, we're looking at a seriously big bang.
208	00:12:21	00:12:22	First calculation.
209	00:12:22	00:12:28	I estimated that at least 25 hundred mega joules of energy were released by that blast.
210	00:12:28	00:12:30	That is a lot more than just fuel igniting.
211	00:12:30	00:12:32	Sounds like an explosive.
212	00:12:32	00:12:37	Which would explain the indentation to the bottom of the fuel tank.
213	00:12:39	00:12:41	The explosion goes out in all directions.
214	00:12:41	00:12:48	Upward causing the tank to indent, and downward sending the initiator and switch into the ground at the point of detonation.
215	00:12:48	00:12:57	Now, the crime scene sketches show the distribution of debris extending out about 200 feet in a roughly conical pattern.
216	00:12:57	00:13:00	So the truck-- it's moving at 80 miles per hour.
217	00:13:00	00:13:05	That's about 117 feet per second.
218	00:13:05	00:13:07	Oh.
219	00:13:07	00:13:09	Don't patronize me, mathlete.
220	00:13:09	00:13:18	The truck's momentum would have given all of this debris an extra hundred or so feet of flight, putting the actual point of detonation...
221	00:13:18	00:13:20	A hundred feet back. Here.
222	00:13:20	00:13:23	Explains why we didn't find an initiator or a switch at the scene.
223	00:13:23	00:13:25	They were buried back there.
224	00:13:25	00:13:27	Want to test your big bang theory?
225	00:14:06	00:14:08	Nitroglycerine residue.
226	00:14:08	00:14:10	Dynamite. Plus all that gas.
227	00:14:10	00:14:12	That's one hell of a bomb.
228	00:14:12	00:14:14	Good call. Mm. Thank Russell.
229	00:14:14	00:14:17	He's the one who pushed me to get my IAI certification.
230	00:14:17	00:14:20	So, we're looking for a bomb, but why?
231	00:14:20	00:14:24	I mean, it's not like the Desert Blast 200 is the Indy 500.
232	00:14:24	00:14:26	A bunch of weekend warriors out in the desert.
233	00:14:26	00:14:28	I just don't see them killing each other.
234	00:14:28	00:14:32	Maybe it's not about the race itself, but who's in the race.
235	00:14:32	00:14:34	We need to find those bomb components.
236	00:14:34	00:14:36	I'll grab Morgan.
237	00:14:36	00:14:38	Go back to the crash site and start digging.
238	00:14:42	00:14:43	I feel like my grandfather.
239	00:14:43	00:14:48	All I need are a pair of suspenders and an egg salad sandwich.
240	00:14:48	00:14:51	Only we're not looking for watches and gold doubloons.
241	00:14:51	00:14:54	I know. We're looking for a detonator.
242	00:14:59	00:15:00	Huh.
243	00:15:02	00:15:03	Beer can pop-top.
244	00:15:03	00:15:05	Keep digging.
245	00:15:05	00:15:06	See if you can find the rest of it.
246	00:15:06	00:15:07	I could use a beer right now.
247	00:15:07	00:15:08	I'll buy you a beer when we're done.
248	00:15:08	00:15:10	How about that?
249	00:15:10	00:15:12	Unless you and Hodges and Mrs. Hodges have plans.
250	00:15:12	00:15:15	Try my dad and Mrs. Hodges.
251	00:15:27	00:15:28	Ha-ho, look at this.
252	00:15:30	00:15:33	Different kind of pop-top. Detonator.
253	00:15:33	00:15:36	Wow. It's an RF receiver.
254	00:15:36	00:15:39	Says that this bomb was detonated remotely.
255	00:15:39	00:15:42	You know, whoever built this thing had some expertise.
256	00:15:42	00:15:45	And it means they could have set it off from a distance.
257	00:15:48	00:15:50	What you got there?
258	00:15:50	00:15:51	Metal frag.
259	00:15:53	00:15:56	Has some kind of serial number.
260	00:15:56	00:15:58	No. Looks more like a VIN number.
261	00:15:58	00:16:02	Judging from the size, I don't think it's part of the bomb.
262	00:16:02	00:16:03	Well, maybe from the truck.
263	00:16:03	00:16:08	Oh, I found so many cannibalized parts on that rig.
264	00:16:08	00:16:11	I ran all the numbers, didn't get any leads.
265	00:16:11	00:16:13	Well, maybe this is the lucky number.
266	00:16:13	00:16:14	I hope you're right.
267	00:16:14	00:16:16	Have a little faith.
268	00:16:16	00:16:18	And you still owe me a beer.
269	00:16:22	00:16:24	Mr. Weber, this is your truck, right?
270	00:16:24	00:16:28	Yeah.
271	00:16:28	00:16:30	What's this about?
272	00:16:30	00:16:32	We found a fragment of an oil pan out in the desert.
273	00:16:32	00:16:34	It was part of a racing truck.
274	00:16:34	00:16:39	But based on the VIN number, we believe that that pan started its life under your vehicle.
275	00:16:39	00:16:42	Racing truck? You got to be kidding me. No.
276	00:16:42	00:16:44	Any idea how that might have happened?
277	00:16:47	00:16:49	You're not gonna believe this.
278	00:16:49	00:16:50	Try me.
279	00:16:50	00:16:54	A month back, I was at Desert Palm Hospital.
280	00:16:54	00:16:55	My wife...
281	00:16:55	00:16:58	Well... she passed.
282	00:16:58	00:16:59	Cancer.
283	00:16:59	00:17:01	I'm so sorry.
284	00:17:01	00:17:04	Left me with a broken heart, and a hell of a bill.
285	00:17:04	00:17:07	I've been trying to work something out with the hospital.
286	00:17:07	00:17:13	Anyway, I came out and found my truck leaking oil, bad enough I couldn't drive it.
287	00:17:13	00:17:14	I knew I couldn't afford to fix it.
288	00:17:14	00:17:16	That's when these fellows came up.
289	00:17:16	00:17:17	Who?
290	00:17:17	00:17:19	I'd never seen 'em before.
291	00:17:19	00:17:21	They checked under the hood.
292	00:17:21	00:17:26	Bad fuel pump and a leaking oil pan, they said.
293	00:17:26	00:17:30	They went and bought me a new one.
294	00:17:30	00:17:31	Just like that?
295	00:17:31	00:17:33	It's crazy, I know.
296	00:17:33	00:17:37	Just like those Good Samaritans who pay off people's layaways at Christmas.
297	00:17:37	00:17:42	By chance... is this one of the Samaritans?
298	00:17:42	00:17:43	Yeah.
299	00:17:43	00:17:45	Uh, there was another guy with him.
300	00:17:45	00:17:47	Um, wore glasses.
301	00:17:47	00:17:50	While the fellow with the glasses was working on the engine, this...
302	00:17:50	00:17:52	this guy said something kind of weird.
303	00:17:53	00:17:55	A lot of bad in this world.
304	00:17:55	00:17:56	But we're trying to make something good.
305	00:17:56	00:18:00	And, sir, we're gonna make you part of something really special.
306	00:18:01	00:18:04	These guys have a name?
307	00:18:04	00:18:07	No, they never said.
308	00:18:09	00:18:11	Times have been kind of tough lately.
309	00:18:13	00:18:18	What they did was the first true kindness to come my way in a while.
310	00:18:20	00:18:22	These boys didn't do any harm, did they?
311	00:18:22	00:18:27	Oh, I-I don't think so, but I'm afraid that harm may have found them.
312	00:18:27	00:18:29	Oh, hey, I have something for you.
313	00:18:29	00:18:30	Ooh. Whoa. (laughs)
314	00:18:30	00:18:31	What is that?
315	00:18:31	00:18:32	What is... what is what?
316	00:18:32	00:18:35	That...
317	00:18:35	00:18:36	scent. Oh.
318	00:18:36	00:18:40	It's my new musk. Rosa Misteriosa.
319	00:18:40	00:18:43	Right. Your Italian kick.
320	00:18:43	00:18:44	It's like a boot to the nose.
321	00:18:44	00:18:45	Too much?
322	00:18:45	00:18:46	Yeah. Huh.
323	00:18:46	00:18:48	There are some women who like it.
324	00:18:48	00:18:49	Are we talking about your mother?
325	00:18:49	00:18:51	We are talking about none of your business.
326	00:18:51	00:18:55	So, I was able to track down the RF receiver that you and Greg found at the crash site.
327	00:18:55	00:19:00	It's a fairly common component in do-it-yourself household devices, like doorbells or garage door openers.
328	00:19:00	00:19:02	Too common to trace.
329	00:19:02	00:19:07	Yes. However, the tire treads from the vehicle that drove over the debris at the crash site, those treads are unique.
330	00:19:07	00:19:11	It's a Minooka Tires model that hasn't yet been commercially released.
331	00:19:11	00:19:13	Only demo'd to a few select racing teams.
332	00:19:13	00:19:15	Look at the name at the bottom of the list.
333	00:19:15	00:19:18	Veck Oil Race Team, as in Kathy Veck.
334	00:19:18	00:19:20	Russell told me about her.
335	00:19:20	00:19:21	Hmm.
336	00:19:21	00:19:24	Hope he's got his seatbelt fastened.
337	00:19:24	00:19:32	Ms. Veck, you said that you were ahead of the Pharaoh's Motorists truck when it crashed, is that right?
338	00:19:32	00:19:33	Yes, that is right.
339	00:19:33	00:19:36	Are you sure about that?
340	00:19:36	00:19:41	Because the evidence says that you were behind it, and that you didn't even stop to lend them a hand.
341	00:19:41	00:19:43	You just drove right on by.
342	00:19:43	00:19:47	Well, maybe I was mistaken in my first recollection.
343	00:19:47	00:19:50	Well, why don't you tell me what did happen, then?
344	00:19:50	00:20:01	Okay, look, uh... I barely saw the fire through the dust and the heat of the race, and I figured, whoever they were, they would be all right.
345	00:20:03	00:20:06	And what the heck. You'd be in first place, right?
346	00:20:06	00:20:08	Racing is a dangerous sport, Mr. Russell, okay?
347	00:20:08	00:20:10	Accidents happen.
348	00:20:10	00:20:12	Are you accusing me of something?
349	00:20:12	00:20:14	You lied about where you were and what you saw.
350	00:20:14	00:20:16	It makes me wonder what else you might have lied about.
351	00:20:16	00:20:19	Like eliminating the competition maybe?
352	00:20:19	00:20:20	Competition?
353	00:20:20	00:20:26	You're talking about a rookie race team no one's ever heard of, driving a junkyard mess of spare parts.
354	00:20:26	00:20:29	I thought you were just accusing me of bad sportsmanship.
355	00:20:29	00:20:30	You're talking about, what, sabotage now?
356	00:20:30	00:20:32	No, actually, much more than that.
357	00:20:32	00:20:37	I'm talking about placing a bomb in a racing truck, and then, detonating it remotely.
358	00:20:40	00:20:45	Look, I don't know who those Pharaoh boys were, okay?
359	00:20:45	00:20:49	But if anyone had a target on their back in that race, it was me.
360	00:20:49	00:20:50	And why do you think that?
361	00:20:50	00:20:52	I run a petroleum company, okay?
362	00:20:52	00:20:53	I've got lots of enemies.
363	00:20:53	00:20:56	Earth-liberators, big-oil haters.
364	00:20:56	00:20:58	People who hate paying at the pump, you name it.
365	00:20:58	00:21:01	Well, I'm in law enforcement. A lot of people hate me, too.
366	00:21:03	00:21:05	Do they send you a hundred of these a day?
367	00:21:09	00:21:14	I decided a long time ago not to give them the satisfaction of running and hiding.
368	00:21:14	00:21:16	Screw 'em.
369	00:21:16	00:21:18	You Veck Oil bitch.
370	00:21:18	00:21:24	One thing certain is death and taxes, but since you don't pay taxes, the only thing certain for you is death.
371	00:21:24	00:21:28	You destroyed my life, and now I'm going to soak you in your own oil... Ooh.
372	00:21:28	00:21:29	...and light a match.
373	00:21:29	00:21:37	Kind of reminds me of the e-mails I used to get from my third wife. I mean, come on, it's horrible, but is it credible? Well, it's credible enough to look into, don't you think?
374	00:21:37	00:21:44	I mean, you got three guys who show up out of nowhere, using aliases, calling themselves some vaguely Middle Eastern name.
375	00:21:44	00:21:47	And they got a bomb strapped to their truck.
376	00:21:47	00:21:49	Wait a minute-- you think these guys are terrorists?
377	00:21:49	00:21:51	Well, domestic, maybe.
378	00:21:51	00:21:54	I mean, it fits the message they sent to the driver.
379	00:21:54	00:21:57	Walk away. We're not going to be able to pull this off.
380	00:21:57	00:22:01	Sounds to me like someone's trying to abort the mission, doesn't it?
381	00:22:01	00:22:03	We get anything else off that voice mail?
382	00:22:03	00:22:04	Henry's working on it.
383	00:22:04	00:22:07	Jack, listen, they're onto us.
384	00:22:07	00:22:13	We're not going to be able to pull this off. Walk awa-- Jack, listen, they're onto us.
385	00:22:13	00:22:14	Jack, listen...
386	00:22:24	00:22:29	I dug out the background audio in the voice mail; I thought it might help us pin down a location of the anonymous caller.
387	00:22:29	00:22:31	Athrok, we're running out of time!
388	00:22:31	00:22:33	To the fire service cave! Now!
389	00:22:33	00:22:37	Athrok the Conqueror, that dragon movie.
390	00:22:37	00:22:41	You know it's not in theaters anymore, and I'm pretty sure it didn't come out on DVD because I wanted to see that.
391	00:22:41	00:22:44	Wait, you-you like fantasy movies?
392	00:22:44	00:22:46	Yeah. I saw Lord of the Rings, like, 40 times.
393	00:22:46	00:22:49	That's awesome.
394	00:22:49	00:22:56	Okay, now, I called around and Athrok is currently on just one video-on-demand service used by only ten Vegas hotels.
395	00:22:56	00:22:58	17 p.m..
396	00:22:58	00:23:01	Yeah, only one hotel had a customer rent the film at that time.
397	00:23:01	00:23:03	Bridgemoor Hotel, Room 20.
398	00:23:03	00:23:08	So the room is registered under the same fake name as the captain of the Pharaoh's Motorists team, Doug White.
399	00:23:08	00:23:10	He paid in cash, and this is it.
400	00:23:12	00:23:14	LVPD! Open up!
401	00:23:24	00:23:26	Bathroom's clear.
402	00:23:26	00:23:27	Yeah, it's clear out here.
403	00:23:29	00:23:31	Ah, pictures of Kathy Veck.
404	00:23:31	00:23:33	Maybe some other targets, too.
405	00:23:35	00:23:37	We got a Malcolm Platt.
406	00:23:39	00:23:41	Clive Morris.
407	00:23:41	00:23:42	Our other two White brothers.
408	00:23:42	00:23:44	Look at this.
409	00:23:44	00:23:51	U.S. Army Field Manual, Anarchist Cookbook, Guide to U.S. Government Facilities.
410	00:23:51	00:23:52	Guess these guys are serious.
411	00:23:55	00:23:56	I thought you said it was clear. It was.
412	00:24:02	00:24:03	Well, this is a new one.
413	00:24:03	00:24:05	Usually we gotta stop them from going out the window.
414	00:24:05	00:24:07	Get up.
415	00:24:07	00:24:09	Keep your hands where I can see them.
416	00:24:09	00:24:11	Right here.
417	00:24:11	00:24:14	Let's see which White brother we got.
418	00:24:14	00:24:15	Clive Morris.
419	00:24:15	00:24:17	My name doesn't matter.
420	00:24:17	00:24:19	There are more just like me.
421	00:24:22	00:24:24	You'll never stop us all.
422	00:24:36	00:24:41	Looks like Kathy Veck isn't the only one you have issues with, Clive.
423	00:24:41	00:24:43	You have no right to these documents.
424	00:24:43	00:24:45	Clive, we know where Jack is.
425	00:24:45	00:24:47	Wh-wh-where's Malcolm?
426	00:24:49	00:24:50	Clive?
427	00:24:50	00:24:52	You said there were others out there like you.
428	00:24:52	00:24:53	Where's Malcolm?
429	00:24:53	00:24:55	What are you all planning?
430	00:24:55	00:24:57	Another attack?
431	00:24:57	00:24:59	Whatever the battle calls for.
432	00:24:59	00:25:00	I'm sorry.
433	00:25:00	00:25:02	What battle is that again?
434	00:25:04	00:25:09	I stand in solidarity with all people targeted by government control and economic violence.
435	00:25:09	00:25:11	What about Jack Breslin?
436	00:25:11	00:25:14	Did he stand with you before he blew himself up?
437	00:25:16	00:25:19	I know you have cameras taping this.
438	00:25:19	00:25:22	They're for your protection, Clive, and ours.
439	00:25:26	00:25:28	I like your glasses.
440	00:25:28	00:25:30	Thank you.
441	00:25:30	00:25:33	Yeah, my, uh, my wife helped me pick these out.
442	00:25:35	00:25:38	Do you wear glasses, Clive?
443	00:25:40	00:25:41	Don't need them.
444	00:25:41	00:25:43	Glad we got that straight.
445	00:25:43	00:25:45	Look, I get it.
446	00:25:45	00:25:48	Veck Oil are Earth vampires, and your mission...
447	00:25:48	00:25:52	Oh, so you know what's going on inside my mind now, do you?
448	00:25:52	00:25:54	I know what you're doing.
449	00:25:54	00:25:59	I know who you are, and I'm done talking.
450	00:25:59	00:26:04	I can't tell you what's going on inside Clive Morris's mind, but I can tell you what's going on inside his laptop.
451	00:26:04	00:26:09	I pulled some of these images from his hard drive, the rest are from the motel room.
452	00:26:09	00:26:13	Pictures of the municipal court, Federal Building, City Hall...
453	00:26:13	00:26:14	Kathy Veck.
454	00:26:14	00:26:18	These guys entered the race anonymous looking for an opportunity to blow her up.
455	00:26:18	00:26:21	Yeah, well, good plan, bad execution.
456	00:26:21	00:26:22	Driver's dead, co-driver's missing.
457	00:26:22	00:26:23	You think it was Clive?
458	00:26:23	00:26:25	No, it can't be Clive.
459	00:26:25	00:26:28	He has no injuries, and he tested negative for any bomb residue.
460	00:26:28	00:26:34	So the co-driver's still out there, hopefully not shifting their focus from a rich CEO to other targets.
461	00:26:34	00:26:36	Big, bad government.
462	00:26:36	00:26:38	You know, I'm not buying any of this.
463	00:26:38	00:26:41	Really? You're the one who brought up this whole domestic terrorist theory.
464	00:26:41	00:26:44	I know, but we-we processed that entire motel room.
465	00:26:44	00:26:48	We didn't find any trace of nitrates, we didn't find any bomb-making material.
466	00:26:48	00:26:51	Well, maybe their bomb factory was someplace else.
467	00:26:51	00:26:53	You know, I'm beginning to think their heads are someplace else.
468	00:26:53	00:26:56	Clive Morris asked me about my-my glasses.
469	00:26:56	00:26:58	So?
470	00:26:58	00:26:59	It was the way he asked me.
471	00:26:59	00:27:01	You know, it was like...
472	00:27:01	00:27:08	A-Anyway, look, I've known a few revolutionaries in my time, true believers, all anger, no fear.
473	00:27:08	00:27:11	With Clive Morris, it was just about the opposite.
474	00:27:11	00:27:12	Because he's paranoid.
475	00:27:12	00:27:14	I ran him through missing persons.
476	00:27:14	00:27:21	Turns out he wandered off from Desert Palm where he was being treated for paranoid personality disorder, and he wasn't alone.
477	00:27:21	00:27:26	Malcolm Platt is also AWOL from the psych ward, and Jack Breslin was an out-patient.
478	00:27:28	00:27:30	They called themselves The Three Musketeers.
479	00:27:30	00:27:34	They met here in group therapy, as part of our treatment program.
480	00:27:34	00:27:36	What can you tell me about them?
481	00:27:36	00:27:38	Jack Breslin was a decorated war hero.
482	00:27:38	00:27:43	The very thing that made him a great soldier is what made his reentry into civilian life so difficult.
483	00:27:43	00:27:46	Urbach-Wiethe syndrome, predisposition towards reckless behavior.
484	00:27:46	00:27:48	Yes.
485	00:27:48	00:27:53	Clive Morris was the exact opposite, consumed by fear, paranoia.
486	00:27:53	00:27:55	The courts referred him to me five months ago.
487	00:27:55	00:27:57	Police say he's led them on a number of high-speed car chases?
488	00:27:57	00:28:03	Clive believed he was being followed by the CIA, the FBI, the usual paranoid fantasies.
489	00:28:03	00:28:05	What about, uh, Malcolm Platt?
490	00:28:05	00:28:07	What's his diagnosis?
491	00:28:07	00:28:08	Malcolm is schizophrenic.
492	00:28:08	00:28:10	Suffers delusions of grandeur.
493	00:28:10	00:28:11	Is he dangerous?
494	00:28:11	00:28:15	I would describe him more as, uh... volatile.
495	00:28:15	00:28:19	When the three of them were together, did they ever discuss acts of violence?
496	00:28:19	00:28:20	Oh, hardly.
497	00:28:20	00:28:22	They all shared one love.
498	00:28:22	00:28:23	What's that?
499	00:28:23	00:28:24	Auto racing.
500	00:28:24	00:28:31	Every weekend, without fail, The Three Musketeers would get together for popcorn and a race, cheering on their favorites.
501	00:28:31	00:28:32	Whoo!
502	00:28:34	00:28:37	I asked Clive once why he liked racing so much.
503	00:28:37	00:28:41	He said, Where else can a bunch of mechanics become heroes?
504	00:28:41	00:28:43	Do you think Clive is the leader of the group?
505	00:28:43	00:28:45	Clive? No.
506	00:28:45	00:28:47	Malcolm was the one always leading the charge.
507	00:28:47	00:28:48	Yeah, we've been looking for him.
508	00:28:48	00:28:50	Any idea where he might be?
509	00:28:50	00:28:56	All I know is Malcolm's mother said he called her two days ago from a pay phone, told her he was on some kind of mission.
510	00:28:58	00:28:59	I pulled Malcolm Platt's rap sheet.
511	00:28:59	00:29:02	I'd say volatile is putting it mildly.
512	00:29:02	00:29:04	Three attempted auto thefts, three attempted assaults.
513	00:29:04	00:29:07	The guy has delusions of being rich and owning fast cars.
514	00:29:07	00:29:12	He walks into a dealership, grabs a key and conducts his own grand-theft test drive.
515	00:29:12	00:29:13	That's a good way to avoid haggling, right?
516	00:29:13	00:29:17	Yeah, until the salesperson tries to stop you.
517	00:29:17	00:29:20	Are you playing hangman?
518	00:29:20	00:29:24	No, no, more like a brain teaser.
519	00:29:24	00:29:27	A Pharaoh's Motorists.
520	00:29:27	00:29:31	The A at the beginning was bothering me, so I started rearranging the letters.
521	00:29:31	00:29:33	What do you think?
522	00:29:33	00:29:36	Athos, Porthos, Aramis.
523	00:29:36	00:29:39	The Three Musketeers.
524	00:29:39	00:29:41	Yeah, see, I don't think we're looking at a sleeper cell.
525	00:29:41	00:29:43	I think we're looking at-at dreamers, you know?
526	00:29:43	00:29:44	Misfits.
527	00:29:44	00:29:48	Guys who were obsessed with racing wanted to win the big one.
528	00:29:48	00:29:51	And how do you explain the bomb?
529	00:29:51	00:29:57	I can't right now, but I-I just know when I'm looking at Clive Morris that I'm not looking at a killer.
530	00:29:59	00:30:01	The glasses, right?
531	00:30:01	00:30:04	Paranoid personality disorder.
532	00:30:04	00:30:06	Yeah.
533	00:30:06	00:30:08	I've seen it before, and um...
534	00:30:08	00:30:15	growing up the way I did with my crazy, wandering family, I was always the weird one.
535	00:30:15	00:30:17	Couldn't have been easy living in a van.
536	00:30:17	00:30:21	No, but every summer, I got this little taste of normal.
537	00:30:21	00:30:25	You know, we'd always land at my cousin's house for a-a whole month.
538	00:30:25	00:30:26	He was a really good kid.
539	00:30:26	00:30:28	Great at basketball.
540	00:30:28	00:30:33	But one summer, he started telling me about this birdhouse that a neighbor had built across the street.
541	00:30:33	00:30:38	He was convinced that there was a camera inside it, right?
542	00:30:38	00:30:44	Every time we walked by it, he'd look up and smile and then, pfft, flip it off.
543	00:30:44	00:30:46	Yeah. They're watching.
544	00:30:46	00:30:47	Yeah.
545	00:30:47	00:30:52	The way Clive Morris was looking around the room for the cameras, reminded me of my cousin.
546	00:30:52	00:30:54	It got worse, too.
547	00:30:54	00:31:00	Towards the end, he, uh, even thought that my glasses were cameras, and that I was recording his every move.
548	00:31:00	00:31:02	What happened to him?
549	00:31:02	00:31:05	Not a happy ending.
550	00:31:11	00:31:13	Yeah, I know a little bit about, uh...
551	00:31:13	00:31:15	that kind of sad ending myself.
552	00:31:16	00:31:18	My mom.
553	00:31:18	00:31:21	I didn't know that. I'm sorry.
554	00:31:21	00:31:23	Me, too.
555	00:31:24	00:31:26	Oh, Henry.
556	00:31:26	00:31:27	Huh.
557	00:31:27	00:31:29	Excuse me.
558	00:31:32	00:31:33	What do you got?
559	00:31:33	00:31:38	I've been tracking how Kathy Veck received her digital death threats.
560	00:31:38	00:31:44	Now, the majority of recent ones came from an e-mail account belonging to Malcolm Platt.
561	00:31:44	00:31:45	I had a feeling about this guy.
562	00:31:45	00:31:47	The last one was sent an hour ago.
563	00:31:47	00:31:50	Now, I traced it to his active IP.
564	00:31:50	00:31:53	It was routed though a hotspot in the middle of the desert, the middle of nowhere.
565	00:31:53	00:31:56	More like a middle of The Desert Blast 200 course.
566	00:31:56	00:31:59	I heard the race was back on, so Kathy Veck's probably there, right?
567	00:32:04	00:32:06	Veck never showed at the starting line.
568	00:32:06	00:32:07	Nobody's seen her all morning.
569	00:32:07	00:32:09	They figured she probably dropped out of the race.
570	00:32:09	00:32:11	Yeah, then what's her camp still doing here?
571	00:32:11	00:32:12	Good question.
572	00:32:12	00:32:14	Wait, hold up.
573	00:32:14	00:32:16	That looks like blood right there, boys.
574	00:32:20	00:32:21	LVPD!
575	00:32:42	00:32:43	It's Malcolm Platt.
576	00:32:43	00:32:46	Malcolm, what happened?
577	00:32:46	00:32:47	It's Vartann. I need a paramedic ASAP.
578	00:32:47	00:32:49	He took her.
579	00:32:49	00:32:51	Took who?
580	00:32:51	00:32:53	Kathy. Veck.
581	00:32:53	00:32:55	He's gonna kill her.
582	00:32:55	00:32:57	Who's gonna kill her, Malcolm?
583	00:32:57	00:32:58	Paramedics are en route.
584	00:32:58	00:33:01	Malcolm.
585	00:33:01	00:33:02	Malcolm?
586	00:33:02	00:33:03	It's too late for that now.
587	00:33:03	00:33:06	Where's Kathy Veck? He didn't say.
588	00:33:06	00:33:09	But with all this carnage left behind her, she can't be headed anywhere good.
589	00:33:19	00:33:20	Vartann put a BOLO out on Kathy Veck's racing truck.
590	00:33:20	00:33:22	You got to figure whoever took her, took her in it.
591	00:33:22	00:33:24	And look what Nick found next to Veck's pit.
592	00:33:24	00:33:25	Empty box of dynamite.
593	00:33:25	00:33:28	That used to have 20 pieces.
594	00:33:28	00:33:31	Maybe our guy with the gun took them along on his ride with Kathy.
595	00:33:31	00:33:33	That is a lot of firepower.
596	00:33:33	00:33:36	Who would Malcolm trust this much that he went along with him?
597	00:33:36	00:33:41	I mean, with Jack dead and Clive in custody, there aren't any other Musketeers.
598	00:33:41	00:33:47	You know, I don't want to sound like Russell, but wasn't there a fourth Musketeer in the original story? Yes.
599	00:33:47	00:33:48	And...
600	00:33:48	00:33:52	we still have a Musketeer in lockup who may be able to tell us who that is.
601	00:33:54	00:33:56	I've never raced a car before.
602	00:33:56	00:33:59	I guess I don't like to go fast.
603	00:33:59	00:34:00	What about you, Clive?
604	00:34:00	00:34:02	Why do you race?
605	00:34:03	00:34:06	Oh, no, it's not a camera.
606	00:34:06	00:34:08	And these... these aren't, either.
607	00:34:08	00:34:11	Here. I'm sorry, I'll... put 'em away.
608	00:34:11	00:34:13	Why do you care?
609	00:34:13	00:34:16	We're profiling you; it's what we do, Clive.
610	00:34:16	00:34:19	My guess is that you love the danger of racing.
611	00:34:19	00:34:24	It's a way for you to embrace all of your fear and channel it into adrenaline.
612	00:34:24	00:34:26	I think we do.
613	00:34:26	00:34:29	I don't even think that you knew there was a bomb in that truck.
614	00:34:29	00:34:32	Neither did Jack. Malcolm, though, I'm not so sure about.
615	00:34:32	00:34:33	No.
616	00:34:35	00:34:38	Malcolm was committed to winning the race, too.
617	00:34:38	00:34:43	Winning the race-- that's all you guys wanted, isn't it?
618	00:34:43	00:34:48	The message you left for Jack about not getting in the truck...
619	00:34:48	00:34:50	it wasn't about the bomb-- you didn't even know it was a bomb.
620	00:34:50	00:34:53	So what were you afraid of?
621	00:34:55	00:34:58	I saw the way she was looking at us.
622	00:34:58	00:35:00	The night before the race.
623	00:35:00	00:35:01	Her and her goons.
624	00:35:01	00:35:03	Kathy Veck?
625	00:35:03	00:35:06	I knew she wasn't gonna let us win.
626	00:35:06	00:35:09	I knew she was gonna ruin our one chance.
627	00:35:09	00:35:11	What do you mean, your...
628	00:35:11	00:35:15	Our chance to show Kathy Veck that money doesn't always rule.
629	00:35:15	00:35:17	What does rule, Clive?
630	00:35:17	00:35:20	Heart.
631	00:35:20	00:35:22	Truth.
632	00:35:23	00:35:26	Loyalty.
633	00:35:26	00:35:33	You know, I know I'm not gonna ever convince you to trust me, so I'm just gonna tell you what I believe.
634	00:35:33	00:35:35	I don't think you're a stupid man.
635	00:35:35	00:35:37	I think you're very bright.
636	00:35:37	00:35:40	People like Kathy Veck don't have to get their hands dirty to win.
637	00:35:40	00:35:46	She didn't put that bomb on your truck, but somebody did, and that someone had access to your truck.
638	00:35:48	00:35:51	There's a fourth Musketeer, isn't there?
639	00:35:51	00:35:57	Oh, come on, Clive, what just happened to... to heart, truth, loyalty?
640	00:35:57	00:36:00	I mean, whoever did it killed your friends.
641	00:36:00	00:36:03	Don't you think you owe them a little justice?
642	00:36:03	00:36:04	Clive...
643	00:36:06	00:36:08	...you've got to help us.
644	00:36:19	00:36:22	Entering the truck was his idea.
645	00:36:22	00:36:24	He helped us build it.
646	00:36:24	00:36:27	He said he was gonna make us part of something really special.
647	00:36:27	00:36:29	There was a lot of bad in the world.
648	00:36:31	00:36:34	He was trying to make something good.
649	00:36:34	00:36:36	I've heard those words before.
650	00:36:37	00:36:40	Your fourth Musketeer told me the same thing.
651	00:36:43	00:36:46	Art Weber is the fourth Musketeer.
652	00:36:46	00:36:48	He didn't expect us to follow that oil pan back to them.
653	00:36:48	00:36:53	He even said himself that he was gonna tell me a crazy story, which I fell for.
654	00:36:53	00:36:54	SANDERS He's a retired engineer.
655	00:36:54	00:36:57	Worked at Ferndale Mining Company. Wait a minute.
656	00:36:57	00:37:02	Serial number on the empty box of dynamite we found at the scene traces back to Ferndale Mining Company.
657	00:37:02	00:37:04	Guess we know who the bomb maker is.
658	00:37:04	00:37:09	And according to my math, Art used only two sticks of dynamite on that racing truck.
659	00:37:09	00:37:10	Dynamite crate held 20.
660	00:37:10	00:37:12	I mean, he's got enough to...
661	00:37:12	00:37:14	take down a building.
662	00:37:15	00:37:22	Okay, Web search SickWithRage.com.
663	00:37:22	00:37:25	And this one is from about a month ago.
664	00:37:25	00:37:31	Used to be you work your ass off for a company, they'd take care of you and your loved ones, but no more.
665	00:37:31	00:37:39	Corporate scum come in, pillage our pensions, strip our health care, leave my wife to die, leave me bankrupt... (scoffs)
666	00:37:39	00:37:42	Hey, just following orders. Bull.
667	00:37:42	00:37:44	I will not go gently!
668	00:37:44	00:37:47	They started this war; I'll finish it!
669	00:37:47	00:37:50	What put Kathy Veck in his crosshairs?
670	00:37:52	00:37:58	Ferndale Mining Company, a subsidiary of Veck Oil International.
671	00:37:58	00:38:08	He blames Kathy Veck for his wife's death, for leaving him penniless... So Weber learns that Veck's gonna be out in the desert racing, alone, vulnerable.
672	00:38:08	00:38:11	He sees a rare opportunity to get at her.
673	00:38:11	00:38:16	Then he meets the Musketeers, also vulnerable in their own way... He used them.
674	00:38:16	00:38:18	He secretly turned their truck into a bomb on wheels.
675	00:38:18	00:38:23	Weber knew from driver radio when that truck was gonna be near Veck's.
676	00:38:23	00:38:25	He detonates the bomb and he misses his target.
677	00:38:25	00:38:27	All right, so Weber switches gears.
678	00:38:27	00:38:29	He kidnaps Veck instead.
679	00:38:29	00:38:31	But why not kill her? Why take her for a ride?
680	00:38:31	00:38:33	The dynamite.
681	00:38:33	00:38:35	He wanted to blow her up at the race, right?
682	00:38:35	00:38:39	Maybe now he's planning to make an even bigger statement.
683	00:39:02	00:39:04	Get out of my way if you want to live!
684	00:39:04	00:39:07	Mr. Weber? I'm not talking to the cops!
685	00:39:07	00:39:10	You people protect scum like her and make guys like me the criminals!
686	00:39:10	00:39:13	Get me out of here! This guy is crazy! Keep your mouth shut!
687	00:39:13	00:39:16	Sir, sir, I'm not even gonna try to talk to you, I promise.
688	00:39:16	00:39:18	But there's someone here who wants to.
689	00:39:18	00:39:19	Please.
690	00:39:19	00:39:21	Clive, come here.
691	00:39:23	00:39:24	Look at me. Look at me.
692	00:39:24	00:39:26	Settle down. Look at me. Look me in the eyes.
693	00:39:26	00:39:28	You can do this.
694	00:39:28	00:39:30	All right? Just talk to him, just talk to him.
695	00:39:35	00:39:37	We were supposed to win, Art.
696	00:39:39	00:39:41	You're not gonna win like this.
697	00:39:41	00:39:44	Get out of here, Clive.
698	00:39:44	00:39:45	No!
699	00:39:47	00:39:50	You said you wanted to make something good.
700	00:39:52	00:39:54	This isn't what your wife would have wanted...
701	00:39:54	00:39:56	I don't want to talk about my wife!
702	00:39:56	00:39:58	I know.
703	00:39:58	00:40:00	I-I know you loved her.
704	00:40:00	00:40:02	Like I loved Jack and Malcolm.
705	00:40:02	00:40:05	Please...
706	00:40:05	00:40:07	don't-don't hurt anyone else.
707	00:40:07	00:40:12	Look, i-if you do this, people like her, they win-- you don't want that.
708	00:40:14	00:40:16	You don't know what you're talking about.
709	00:40:16	00:40:18	But I do.
710	00:40:18	00:40:20	He's right.
711	00:40:20	00:40:28	'Cause if you do this, Art, tomorrow morning, newspapers are gonna say that some crazy guy went nuts and killed a pillar of the community.
712	00:40:33	00:40:35	Wh-What am I supposed to do?
713	00:40:37	00:40:39	Just do the right thing, Art.
714	00:40:39	00:40:42	Come on, you don't want to do this.
715	00:40:42	00:40:44	You're not like her.
716	00:40:52	00:40:54	You're right.
717	00:40:55	00:40:57	I'm not.
718	00:41:12	00:41:14	Poor Clive.
719	00:41:14	00:41:27	Can you imagine, the whole world seems upside down to you, enemies in every shadow, never knowing for sure what's real and what's not, and then you finally meet two friends?
720	00:41:27	00:41:31	People you have a dream in common with.
721	00:41:31	00:41:33	For once you fit? Yeah.
722	00:41:33	00:41:40	Like three gears, three damaged gears that are finally meshing, and they're working, they're racing, they're not just dreaming.
723	00:41:40	00:41:47	Until it all goes up in flames, because... there really was someone lurking in the shadows.
724	00:41:48	00:41:51	Crazy, isn't it?
