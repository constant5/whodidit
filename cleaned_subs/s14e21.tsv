0	00:00:33	00:00:37	I'm standing live in front of the Berman estate, where the casino mogul's wife has been killed...
1	00:00:37	00:00:40	Mr. Berman, I've been told, is nowhere to be found.
2	00:00:40	00:00:41	Hey, Anderson Cooper.
3	00:00:41	00:00:42	What? Yeah, you.
4	00:00:42	00:00:43	Do a 180 and take a hike.
5	00:00:43	00:00:46	I don't care about freedom of the press.
6	00:00:46	00:00:47	Move the perimeter back.
7	00:00:47	00:00:49	Move it back.
8	00:00:49	00:00:51	And somebody shut that damn dog up.
9	00:00:51	00:00:53	Where is Lee Berman?!
10	00:00:53	00:00:55	Where's the husband?
11	00:00:55	00:00:57	Metcalf, Smith, put out a broadcast!
12	00:00:57	00:00:59	I want to talk to him in ten minutes.
13	00:01:01	00:01:03	Turn the car off.
14	00:01:03	00:01:06	Step out of the vehicle and get your hands in the air.
15	00:01:08	00:01:10	Do you know who I am?
16	00:01:10	00:01:11	Lee Berman.
17	00:01:11	00:01:13	I own the Tangiers. Ring a bell?
18	00:01:13	00:01:18	One call to Sheriff Ecklie, and I turn you all into mall cops.
19	00:01:18	00:01:19	Looks like we got a gun in the car, boys.
20	00:01:19	00:01:20	Nine-millimeter.
21	00:01:20	00:01:21	Don't cuff him yet, Akers.
22	00:01:21	00:01:23	This is a red flag case.
23	00:01:23	00:01:25	Spin him around here. I'll process him on site.
24	00:01:25	00:01:28	Right hand. Palm down.
25	00:01:32	00:01:34	Okay, now you can hook him.
26	00:01:34	00:01:38	Mr. Berman, you are under arrest for suspicion of murder.
27	00:01:38	00:01:41	Murder? Who died?
28	00:01:41	00:01:43	Your wife.
29	00:02:21	00:02:22	Hmm.
30	00:02:25	00:02:27	Ah.
31	00:02:27	00:02:29	Oh, there you go.
32	00:02:32	00:02:34	Hey.
33	00:02:34	00:02:36	Smart house, right?
34	00:02:36	00:02:38	You walk into the room, lights go on.
35	00:02:38	00:02:39	You walk out, they go off.
36	00:02:39	00:02:41	Yeah, I know.
37	00:02:41	00:02:43	Me and Umbrella Man just lit up together.
38	00:02:43	00:02:49	I'm assuming that one of the 18 cameras outside got a good look at our killer.
39	00:02:49	00:02:53	Actually, someone outsmarted the smart house.
40	00:02:53	00:02:58	Alarm system and surveillance cameras were disabled 17 a.m. for an hour.
41	00:02:58	00:02:59	Remotely.
42	00:02:59	00:03:08	The good news is, from the garage, down the hall, through the foyer, into the master bedroom.
43	00:03:08	00:03:10	In and out in less than six minutes.
44	00:03:10	00:03:12	No wrong turns.
45	00:03:12	00:03:17	Whoever killed Audrey Berman was familiar with the house.
46	00:03:21	00:03:24	D.B.
47	00:03:24	00:03:27	First two shots were not immediately fatal.
48	00:03:27	00:03:30	Third shot, she wasn't so lucky.
49	00:03:32	00:03:33	She gave it a valiant effort.
50	00:03:33	00:03:36	Almost made it to those doors.
51	00:03:38	00:03:40	Nine-mil.
52	00:03:40	00:03:43	Same caliber as the gun that Nick found in Berman's car.
53	00:03:43	00:03:47	So busy killing his wife, he forgot to pick up the casings.
54	00:03:47	00:03:49	Crime of passion.
55	00:03:49	00:03:50	Could be trouble in paradise.
56	00:03:50	00:03:52	His nightstand's completely empty.
57	00:03:52	00:03:54	Look at hers.
58	00:03:55	00:03:58	She also took over both sides of the closet.
59	00:03:58	00:04:02	So I'm thinking that Mr. Berman moved out of this room a while ago.
60	00:04:22	00:04:24	Well, hello there.
61	00:04:34	00:04:36	Where'd you go?
62	00:04:38	00:04:40	Hey, boss. Thanks for getting back to me.
63	00:04:40	00:04:41	Did you ask for a plane?
64	00:04:41	00:04:43	Yes, sir, I did request a plane.
65	00:04:43	00:04:44	That's out of the question.
66	00:04:44	00:04:46	Wait, hear me out.
67	00:04:46	00:04:48	You know the Kitty case that I've been tracking?
68	00:04:48	00:04:50	Yeah. Well, one of her targets, Lee Berman-- his wife was murdered.
69	00:04:50	00:04:52	And?
70	00:04:52	00:04:53	Which tells me our Node is there.
71	00:04:53	00:04:55	But for how long?
72	00:04:55	00:04:57	Ryan, we don't have the resources to send you out there at this time.
73	00:04:57	00:05:01	Sir, with all due respect, you know these cybercriminals-- they're like gophers.
74	00:05:01	00:05:05	If you don't grab 'em when they pop their head out, they're gone forever.
75	00:05:05	00:05:07	I'll see what I can do. Clock's ticking.
76	00:05:07	00:05:09	Ryan... I got to get to Vegas.
77	00:05:50	00:05:53	Special Agent Ryan.
78	00:05:53	00:05:57	I had an up-and-back to St. Thomas until the deputy director called.
79	00:05:57	00:05:58	Ordered me to detour to Vegas.
80	00:05:58	00:06:01	With all due respect, ma'am, we're not running a taxi service here.
81	00:06:01	00:06:05	So why don't you save Uncle Sam a couple of bucks and fly commercial?
82	00:06:05	00:06:10	Captain, I'm gonna tell you three things about yourself, none of which you're gonna like.
83	00:06:10	00:06:15	Number one, there's no such thing as an up-and-back to the Virgin Islands; you go there, you're staying the night.
84	00:06:15	00:06:18	And your returning there, it's not for Mrs. Captain.
85	00:06:18	00:06:20	Ooh. (men chuckle)
86	00:06:20	00:06:22	Number two, you and I both know, morally...
87	00:06:22	00:06:24	Okay. Wheels up.
88	00:06:24	00:06:25	Let's get Agent Ryan to Vegas.
89	00:06:25	00:06:26	Grab my bags.
90	00:06:31	00:06:33	Okay, gentlemen, this is Las Vegas.
91	00:06:33	00:06:35	I'll deal.
92	00:06:35	00:06:36	When was the last time you saw your wife?
93	00:06:36	00:06:38	Yesterday morning.
94	00:06:39	00:06:40	I got you beat.
95	00:06:45	00:06:47	We saw her last night.
96	00:06:47	00:06:49	I didn't kill my wife.
97	00:06:49	00:06:55	Here's a photo of the nine-mil we found on the front seat of your Aston Martin.
98	00:06:55	00:06:58	These are the shell casings that you left behind in your wife's bedroom.
99	00:06:58	00:07:00	Also nine-millimeter.
100	00:07:00	00:07:02	Now, that's the only evidence we have of you in that room.
101	00:07:02	00:07:08	That's because you've been living in the guest bedroom with another piece of tail.
102	00:07:10	00:07:12	I want to know everything about this girl.
103	00:07:12	00:07:15	Who is she, and where is she?
104	00:07:15	00:07:17	Okay.
105	00:07:17	00:07:20	Let me play it out for you.
106	00:07:20	00:07:23	Your marriage is a bust.
107	00:07:23	00:07:25	Nevada's a community property state, right?
108	00:07:25	00:07:27	Your wife is going south.
109	00:07:27	00:07:29	The new chick is heading north.
110	00:07:29	00:07:30	It's a classic trade-up.
111	00:07:30	00:07:33	You kill your wife to be with her.
112	00:07:33	00:07:40	Now, as the comics in the lounge act at the Tangiers like to say, how am I doing?
113	00:07:40	00:07:41	This Brass is good.
114	00:07:41	00:07:46	And he's asking all the right questions, just not my question.
115	00:07:46	00:07:49	Do you mind if we change dealers?
116	00:07:55	00:07:57	Good morning, Mr. Berman.
117	00:07:57	00:07:59	FBI Special Agent Ryan.
118	00:07:59	00:08:01	Cyber Crimes Division.
119	00:08:03	00:08:06	I'm not gonna ask you if you murdered your wife.
120	00:08:06	00:08:12	I'm more interested in a relationship you've been having with a woman online.
121	00:08:15	00:08:17	Her name's Kitty, right?
122	00:08:20	00:08:26	The way your pupils just dilated, I'd say there was a little more than chitchat going on in that chat.
123	00:08:26	00:08:28	Ten-Stars-VIP.com.
124	00:08:28	00:08:30	That ring a bell?
125	00:08:30	00:08:36	An exclusive VIP sex site for affluent men willing to pay for anonymity.
126	00:08:38	00:08:40	I could say more.
127	00:08:40	00:08:42	Everyone with a law degree, take a hike.
128	00:08:42	00:08:45	Mr. Berman, I strong...
129	00:08:52	00:08:54	Want to know something funny?
130	00:08:54	00:08:57	You and I were both seeing Kitty.
131	00:08:59	00:09:05	So, I log in under an assumed name, Ralph, a lonely rancher from Montana.
132	00:09:05	00:09:08	After about a month, Kitty sends me a virtual gift.
133	00:09:08	00:09:11	And when I refuse to open it, she kicks me off the site.
134	00:09:11	00:09:15	So back at Quantico, I'm trying everything.
135	00:09:15	00:09:18	I get male agents to log in under assumed names.
136	00:09:18	00:09:23	But even when we open the gift, still she kicks us off the site.
137	00:09:23	00:09:26	You want to know why?
138	00:09:26	00:09:30	'Cause Kitty is only interested in wealthy men that she can verify.
139	00:09:30	00:09:33	Well-known men, like you.
140	00:09:33	00:09:35	You opened the gift, didn't you?
141	00:09:35	00:09:38	I didn't get any gift.
142	00:09:38	00:09:40	I'm a behavioral scientist.
143	00:09:40	00:09:43	Fancy for human lie detector.
144	00:09:48	00:09:50	Okay.
145	00:09:50	00:09:51	I got a gift.
146	00:09:56	00:09:59	I opened it.
147	00:09:59	00:10:03	The chat box went away, and I could talk to her.
148	00:10:03	00:10:04	No more typing.
149	00:10:04	00:10:07	Hands-free, so to speak.
150	00:10:07	00:10:09	How long did this honeymoon last?
151	00:10:10	00:10:11	A week.
152	00:10:11	00:10:13	Ten days.
153	00:10:14	00:10:16	Then it ended.
154	00:10:16	00:10:17	I ended it.
155	00:10:17	00:10:18	You're lying again.
156	00:10:24	00:10:26	What did Kitty have on you?
157	00:10:31	00:10:34	Call my lawyers back in here.
158	00:10:38	00:10:42	Ran facial recognition on our mystery woman.
159	00:10:42	00:10:44	No hits in the Nevada DMV.
160	00:10:44	00:10:47	You're not gonna find her in any database.
161	00:10:47	00:10:49	It's okay; I can help you with that.
162	00:10:49	00:10:52	Everybody, uh, this is Special Agent Ryan.
163	00:10:52	00:10:59	She's a cyber psychologist specializing in cyber forensics, and I'm afraid I don't know anything else.
164	00:10:59	00:11:01	May I?
165	00:11:17	00:11:18	Clikk, you there?
166	00:11:18	00:11:21	Yes, ma'am. Get me into Kitty.
167	00:11:21	00:11:25	Logging into Ten-Stars-VIP.com.
168	00:11:25	00:11:27	White label user.
169	00:11:27	00:11:29	All I need is a name. All right, CSI, give me a name.
170	00:11:29	00:11:32	Hodges. That's a good name.
171	00:11:32	00:11:33	All right, stand up.
172	00:11:35	00:11:37	Are you a sex site guy?
173	00:11:37	00:11:38	No, ma'am.
174	00:11:38	00:11:41	You ever been on Ten-Stars-VIP.com?
175	00:11:41	00:11:42	No, ma'am.
176	00:11:42	00:11:43	Mm, you sure about that?
177	00:11:45	00:11:46	First name?
178	00:11:46	00:11:47	Uh, that would be David.
179	00:11:47	00:11:50	Clikk, verify David Hodges.
180	00:11:50	00:11:53	Oh, it's the FBI, man-- you're toast.
181	00:11:54	00:11:56	A little deceptive on the sex sites.
182	00:11:56	00:11:59	But he's never been to Ten-Stars-VIP.
183	00:11:59	00:12:00	Okay...
184	00:12:00	00:12:01	uh, I can explain that.
185	00:12:01	00:12:03	I had a fiancée...
186	00:12:03	00:12:05	At ease, stud. Just... just fall back.
187	00:12:06	00:12:08	You are science cops.
188	00:12:08	00:12:10	I'm a cyber cop.
189	00:12:10	00:12:16	I work crimes that start in the mind, live online, and play out in the real world.
190	00:12:16	00:12:18	You work dark alleys.
191	00:12:18	00:12:19	I work the dark Net.
192	00:12:21	00:12:22	You chase suspects.
193	00:12:22	00:12:24	I chase Nodes.
194	00:12:24	00:12:28	Node, short for bad guy.
195	00:12:28	00:12:31	Little childlike drawing.
196	00:12:31	00:12:34	This iceberg represents the Internet.
197	00:12:34	00:12:38	And believe it or not, the world only uses this top four percent.
198	00:12:38	00:12:40	The tip. The surface Web.
199	00:12:40	00:12:51	I work down here, in the 96%, in the deep Web, where criminals are anonymous, where money is untraceable, and where everything illegal's for sale.
200	00:12:51	00:12:52	And what does this have to do with Mr. Berman?
201	00:12:52	00:12:59	Well, Berman's having a relationship with your mystery woman, a woman named Kitty-- and Kitty...
202	00:12:59	00:13:01	she's one of a kind.
203	00:13:02	00:13:04	What's your name?
204	00:13:04	00:13:05	Kitty.
205	00:13:05	00:13:08	Because the more you pet me, the more I purr.
206	00:13:08	00:13:10	What's your name?
207	00:13:10	00:13:13	David. Kitty-- ooh, I like that.
208	00:13:13	00:13:15	What else do you like, David?
209	00:13:15	00:13:17	Oh, I like sex.
210	00:13:17	00:13:18	I like sex too.
211	00:13:18	00:13:20	What are you into?
212	00:13:20	00:13:21	Everything.
213	00:13:21	00:13:23	Name it.
214	00:13:23	00:13:26	How many legs on a bicycle?
215	00:13:26	00:13:29	So you're a leg man?
216	00:13:29	00:13:30	How many bicycles on a leg?
217	00:13:30	00:13:32	You want to ride me?
218	00:13:32	00:13:35	Wow, she always brings it right back to sex.
219	00:13:35	00:13:36	Sex is her business.
220	00:13:36	00:13:38	Now, we're gonna have a little fun.
221	00:13:38	00:13:42	I'm gonna frustrate the algorithm with a nonresponsive response.
222	00:13:42	00:13:44	You want to ride me?
223	00:13:44	00:13:45	You want to ride me hard?
224	00:13:47	00:13:49	Chain. Yank. Sweat.
225	00:13:49	00:13:51	Wet. Bleed. Finger. Lick.
226	00:13:51	00:13:53	Tongue. Ass. Ride.
227	00:13:53	00:13:56	Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.
228	00:13:56	00:13:59	Ri...
229	00:14:00	00:14:04	Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.
230	00:14:04	00:14:08	Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride...
231	00:14:08	00:14:11	What the hell kind of sex site is this?
232	00:14:11	00:14:13	My team has been tracking Kitty for six weeks.
233	00:14:13	00:14:18	She is a computer-animated avatar chatbot with machine-learning artificial intelligence.
234	00:14:18	00:14:20	Okay, good, we're all caught up now.
235	00:14:20	00:14:22	So...
236	00:14:22	00:14:24	she's not real.
237	00:14:24	00:14:27	But the person who created her is.
238	00:14:27	00:14:30	That's why I'm here.
239	00:14:41	00:14:44	What's with the mushrooms?
240	00:14:44	00:14:46	It's in my nature to nurture.
241	00:14:47	00:14:53	I guess I threw you a little curveball with Kitty, didn't I? You know, all this cyber hocus-pocus is fascinating, but...
242	00:14:53	00:14:55	now what?
243	00:14:55	00:15:02	I still have a dead woman downstairs, a casino mogul with GSR on his hands, a gun on the front seat.
244	00:15:02	00:15:06	Up until now, I've been thinking that Lee Berman killed his wife for a...
245	00:15:06	00:15:08	a younger woman online.
246	00:15:08	00:15:15	You come along, you tap a few keys, and then you reduce our motive to a bunch of digital bits.
247	00:15:15	00:15:16	So...
248	00:15:16	00:15:17	where's that leave me?
249	00:15:17	00:15:20	Can you cut me CSI Finlay?
250	00:15:20	00:15:24	I'm bucking time here. I really need to get into the husband's computer.
251	00:15:24	00:15:26	Why her?
252	00:15:26	00:15:28	Men. Sex sites.
253	00:15:28	00:15:30	They're time assassins. Fine with me.
254	00:15:30	00:15:36	But Lee Berman's computer wiped out right in my hands, so... Was a sledge hammer involved?
255	00:15:36	00:15:37	No.
256	00:15:37	00:15:41	Then... the data's still there.
257	00:16:21	00:16:22	Oh, look.
258	00:16:22	00:16:24	Virus detected.
259	00:16:24	00:16:27	Two-way camera enabled on Berman's computer.
260	00:16:27	00:16:28	The gift from Kitty.
261	00:16:28	00:16:31	There are some gifts that should never be opened.
262	00:16:33	00:16:35	Here's what I suspect happened to Berman.
263	00:16:35	00:16:38	No more chat box. No more typing.
264	00:16:38	00:16:41	You can see me. I wish I could see you.
265	00:16:41	00:16:44	Now, let's put those hands to good use.
266	00:16:49	00:16:51	Oh, yeah.
267	00:16:51	00:16:55	He was so happy to be hands-free, he had no idea he was being recorded.
268	00:16:55	00:16:57	Yeah, you're doing great.
269	00:16:57	00:17:00	You're doing great.
270	00:17:00	00:17:04	So Berman made a sex tape and didn't even know it.
271	00:17:04	00:17:10	People forget the cameras on their laptops, their tablets, their cell phones-- they're cameras.
272	00:17:10	00:17:11	They record.
273	00:17:11	00:17:16	I figured if rich guys like Berman were being targeted, money was the end game.
274	00:17:16	00:17:24	And the good news about his two-way cam is that it recorded every one of their encounters, everything from their first hello to their last good-bye.
275	00:17:24	00:17:29	I imagine you pinning me down, taking me against my will.
276	00:17:32	00:17:33	Wait.
277	00:17:33	00:17:37	I want you to dominate me.
278	00:17:37	00:17:39	She can't feel pain; she's not real.
279	00:17:43	00:17:45	Then why is she massaging her jaw?
280	00:17:45	00:17:48	It's usually the sign of an underlying medical condition.
281	00:17:51	00:17:55	Don't you want to see how it ends?
282	00:17:56	00:17:57	David.
283	00:17:57	00:17:58	Hey.
284	00:17:58	00:18:00	I was just bringing this to you.
285	00:18:00	00:18:01	Saves me the trip.
286	00:18:01	00:18:02	What do we got?
287	00:18:02	00:18:04	Nine-mil, right? Mm-hmm.
288	00:18:04	00:18:06	Thank you.
289	00:18:06	00:18:08	Hi, Doc. D.B.
290	00:18:10	00:18:11	What a shame.
291	00:18:11	00:18:13	Audrey Berman was a great lady.
292	00:18:13	00:18:18	Heart of gold when it came to this town, and a very good friend of mine too.
293	00:18:18	00:18:20	Can't say the same for her husband.
294	00:18:20	00:18:23	It's always the better half that gets punished for the other half's sins.
295	00:18:23	00:18:25	What do you got there?
296	00:18:25	00:18:27	Is that a bruise on the ring finger?
297	00:18:27	00:18:29	Minute abrasions along the knuckle.
298	00:18:29	00:18:32	They weren't apparent at the scene.
299	00:18:32	00:18:34	Developed since we brought her in.
300	00:18:34	00:18:37	Wedding ring wasn't in her personal effects.
301	00:18:37	00:18:39	Wasn't in evidence either.
302	00:18:39	00:18:42	This is one of the biggest diamonds I've ever seen.
303	00:18:42	00:18:45	Instant divorce.
304	00:18:58	00:19:00	How we doing on those bullets?
305	00:19:00	00:19:03	(sighs) Bullets from the wife don't match the gun from the husband's car.
306	00:19:03	00:19:06	Nick processed on site.
307	00:19:06	00:19:08	Berman's hands were positive for GSR.
308	00:19:08	00:19:10	I know, but the striae don't match.
309	00:19:12	00:19:14	Berman have a carry permit? I checked.
310	00:19:14	00:19:17	He is a regular member of the Gun Club off Blue Diamond.
311	00:19:17	00:19:19	Well, there you go.
312	00:19:19	00:19:26	GSR on guns is like paint-- it sticks around, maybe long enough to transfer to his hands when he handled it last night.
313	00:19:26	00:19:29	If the gun wasn't the murder weapon, though, why did Berman have it in the first place?
314	00:19:29	00:19:32	There's got to be a reason.
315	00:19:32	00:19:34	How's it going?
316	00:19:34	00:19:36	Hey, good, good.
317	00:19:36	00:19:41	Uh, I know that Greg was jocking Berman's smart house, but I don't think he saw this smart car, man.
318	00:19:41	00:19:43	It's amazing.
319	00:19:43	00:19:48	It's like a detective on wheels; you just give it a CSI badge and a field kit.
320	00:19:48	00:19:50	I did run diagnostics.
321	00:19:50	00:20:04	According to CSI Aston, from the Tangiers, Berman manually entered 15 a.m., arriving at his destination, Industrial Park, 13 a.m.
322	00:20:04	00:20:08	And then, of course, 37.
323	00:20:08	00:20:10	So he was nowhere near the scene.
324	00:20:10	00:20:12	He couldn't have killed his wife.
325	00:20:12	00:20:14	But that doesn't mean he didn't pay for it.
326	00:20:14	00:20:18	That bag I found in the trunk could have been used for a money drop.
327	00:20:19	00:20:22	Okay, so... what do we think?
328	00:20:22	00:20:28	Berman hires some guy to kill his wife, meets him in the park an hour later for the payoff.
329	00:20:28	00:20:30	I mean... that does fit the timeline.
330	00:20:30	00:20:32	I'm not sure it fits the logic, though.
331	00:20:32	00:20:41	I mean, what's a guy like Lee Berman doing driving an Aston Martin 00 in the morning with a gun on his seat?
332	00:20:44	00:20:46	Yeah...
333	00:20:46	00:20:48	we're missing something.
334	00:20:51	00:20:53	This may be what you're missing.
335	00:20:53	00:20:57	You're gonna pay, or you're gonna pay.
336	00:20:57	00:21:00	A hundred thousand-- that was one thing. 250?
337	00:21:00	00:21:02	Now you want a half a million dollars?
338	00:21:02	00:21:04	I'm done.
339	00:21:04	00:21:05	You're done when I say you're done.
340	00:21:05	00:21:07	Now it's a million.
341	00:21:07	00:21:12	You don't want to play ball with me, I will kill your whole family.
342	00:21:12	00:21:16	Who do you want to see in a casket first, your wife or your kids?
343	00:21:16	00:21:18	You leave them out of this.
344	00:21:18	00:21:20	Now it's $2 million.
345	00:21:20	00:21:22	You say another word, and it's four.
346	00:21:22	00:21:26	Same drill-- wire the money, convert it to bitcoins.
347	00:21:26	00:21:27	Forget bitcoins.
348	00:21:27	00:21:29	I want a face-to-face!
349	00:21:29	00:21:32	I'm in charge now! My terms!
350	00:21:32	00:21:34	Industrial Park off Blue Diamond!
351	00:21:34	00:21:35	Cash on delivery!
352	00:21:35	00:21:37	I am ending this tonight!
353	00:21:37	00:21:38	Aw.
354	00:21:38	00:21:40	You do love me.
355	00:21:42	00:21:45	And that was the last time that they spoke.
356	00:21:45	00:21:47	Classic extortion.
357	00:21:47	00:21:51	How does an avatar programmed for sex Kitty's not a sadist.
358	00:21:51	00:21:53	Her creator is. A psycho-sadist.
359	00:21:53	00:21:55	Most likely male.
360	00:21:55	00:22:00	He derives pleasure from inflicting pain on others-- physical, emotional, financial.
361	00:22:00	00:22:02	Berman didn't pay to have his wife killed.
362	00:22:02	00:22:05	He paid the sadist to spare her.
363	00:22:05	00:22:08	But he didn't spare her. She's dead.
364	00:22:08	00:22:15	The second that Berman initiated this power struggle with his my terms bravado, the sadist got pissed.
365	00:22:15	00:22:17	So he killed Berman's wife and he took his money.
366	00:22:17	00:22:21	Which means Berman's the only person who's ever seen this guy.
367	00:22:21	00:22:33	First you tell me this girl is fake, and now you're telling me the guy who was shaking me down killed my wife? Hey, Mr. Berman, we have you on tape agreeing to pay $2 million cash.
368	00:22:33	00:22:35	Question is, who'd you give it to?
369	00:22:35	00:22:38	You can't pay $2 million to a chatbot.
370	00:22:38	00:22:40	So who'd you pay the money to?
371	00:22:42	00:22:44	Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
372	00:22:45	00:22:48	There never was any cash, was there?
373	00:22:48	00:22:54	You went to the Industrial Park not to pay Kitty but to kill her.
374	00:22:54	00:22:58	And when you got there, I'm guessing all you had was your gun in your hand.
375	00:23:01	00:23:03	Gun in my hand?
376	00:23:03	00:23:05	That's a polite way to say it.
377	00:23:11	00:23:12	No one showed.
378	00:23:15	00:23:19	I didn't say it before because...
379	00:23:19	00:23:22	because I was ashamed.
380	00:23:24	00:23:29	I'm fooling around online, and...
381	00:23:29	00:23:31	it gets my wife killed.
382	00:23:31	00:23:34	That's the first honest thing you've said.
383	00:23:37	00:23:42	I'd like to thank both the FBI and the LVPD for proving what we knew all along.
384	00:23:42	00:23:44	Mr. Berman is innocent.
385	00:23:44	00:23:45	And we're out of here.
386	00:23:57	00:23:59	Kitty?
387	00:23:59	00:24:02	Kitty. Kitty. It's you.
388	00:24:02	00:24:05	What the hell is going on?
389	00:24:05	00:24:07	They said she wasn't real!
390	00:24:07	00:24:08	Calm down!
391	00:24:08	00:24:10	I'm looking for the person who gave my picture to the press.
392	00:24:21	00:24:23	My name is Susan McDowell. I'm from San Diego.
393	00:24:23	00:24:25	I'm cooking dinner for my little girls.
394	00:24:25	00:24:30	I look up, and I'm all over the TV, the other woman in a love triangle.
395	00:24:30	00:24:33	Every story mentions the Las Vegas Police Department.
396	00:24:33	00:24:35	I drove five hours. I want answers.
397	00:24:35	00:24:38	I understand. I want some myself.
398	00:24:41	00:24:44	I put your photo out there.
399	00:24:44	00:24:48	The FBI is working a case, and you're a person of interest.
400	00:24:48	00:24:50	Person of interest? Are you kidding me?
401	00:24:50	00:24:52	Do you use social networks?
402	00:24:52	00:24:54	Are you even listening to me?
403	00:24:54	00:24:57	I have a husband overseas serving his country.
404	00:24:57	00:24:59	I am trying to hold my family together.
405	00:24:59	00:25:04	That guy in the hall, he is not the first person to call me Kitty. What about Facebook?
406	00:25:04	00:25:07	Instagram? Snapchat?
407	00:25:07	00:25:08	Vine?
408	00:25:08	00:25:09	Yes. I'm on Friend Agenda.
409	00:25:09	00:25:11	My husband's stationed in Afghanistan.
410	00:25:11	00:25:14	It's the only way we get to see each other.
411	00:25:14	00:25:16	How often are you on it?
412	00:25:16	00:25:17	Every day.
413	00:25:17	00:25:21	I send Bradley photos and videos of the girls.
414	00:25:21	00:25:23	I post whatever I can to bring our life to him.
415	00:25:23	00:25:26	Do you grind your teeth at night?
416	00:25:26	00:25:27	How do you know that?
417	00:25:27	00:25:29	You're massaging your jaw.
418	00:25:29	00:25:31	You have an idiosyncratic medical condition.
419	00:25:31	00:25:34	I'm guessing it's TMJ.
420	00:25:34	00:25:36	It started when my husband deployed.
421	00:25:36	00:25:37	It's how I knew you were out there.
422	00:25:37	00:25:41	And it's why I released her photo.
423	00:25:41	00:25:48	Ms. McDowell, someone took your face, your body, and your mannerisms, and they made a virtual you.
424	00:25:48	00:25:52	They gave it a name, Kitty, and they put it on a sex site.
425	00:25:52	00:25:55	The guy who did it is now making millions of dollars.
426	00:25:55	00:25:57	How could he do that?
427	00:25:57	00:26:00	I think we need to assess your social vulnerability.
428	00:26:05	00:26:07	This is your Friend Agenda page.
429	00:26:07	00:26:10	Do you recognize any of these six people?
430	00:26:11	00:26:15	WittyGirl285 is a girl I went to school with.
431	00:26:15	00:26:20	BarbaraSD is an over-caffeinated mom trying to set up a playdate.
432	00:26:20	00:26:22	I don't know the other four.
433	00:26:22	00:26:27	Today, these are the top six people who viewed your site-- not your friends, your wannabe friends.
434	00:26:27	00:26:31	Your top hit is Nebula1. Who's he?
435	00:26:31	00:26:32	I have no clue.
436	00:26:32	00:26:38	Well, he visited your site 2,507 times in the last six months.
437	00:26:38	00:26:40	That's 15 times a day.
438	00:26:40	00:26:44	Playdate mom? She was there two times a week.
439	00:26:44	00:26:48	That guy hiding behind the smiley face-- he's the one that did this to me?
440	00:26:48	00:26:50	2,500 times? Really?
441	00:26:50	00:26:52	I have two little girls.
442	00:26:52	00:26:54	What if this guy comes after us?
443	00:26:54	00:26:57	I'll protect you.
444	00:26:57	00:26:59	I give you my word.
445	00:27:03	00:27:04	Mr. Berman?
446	00:27:04	00:27:10	Listen, until we catch your wife's killer, I think it would be a good idea for you to stay at the hotel.
447	00:27:10	00:27:12	Little extra layer of security.
448	00:27:14	00:27:17	I don't know what you want to do about your dog.
449	00:27:17	00:27:18	Dog?
450	00:27:18	00:27:20	I don't have a dog.
451	00:27:23	00:27:24	Where you going, bud?
452	00:27:24	00:27:26	Come here.
453	00:27:26	00:27:28	Hey.
454	00:27:28	00:27:30	Nice pooch, Nick.
455	00:27:30	00:27:31	Thank you.
456	00:27:31	00:27:33	Nice pooch, Nick. Yeah, thanks.
457	00:27:33	00:27:37	Hey, so I finally figured out how the killer knew his way around the Berman house.
458	00:27:37	00:27:43	Place was up for sale a few years ago, and the, uh, 360 virtual walk-through is still online.
459	00:27:43	00:27:47	All the killer had to do was take the tour, and he knew every inch of the place. Scary.
460	00:27:47	00:27:56	Something that is supposed to help you sell your house ends up being a blueprint to kill your wife. Yeah, he'd still have to get past guard shacks, armed security, and electronic sensor gates.
461	00:27:56	00:27:58	It's like Shawshank over there.
462	00:27:58	00:28:01	I worked a grand theft horse case there a while back.
463	00:28:01	00:28:03	Community's zoned for four-legged friends.
464	00:28:03	00:28:06	Residents ride their horses in and out of there all the time.
465	00:28:06	00:28:08	Well, that's how he did it.
466	00:28:08	00:28:10	Where there's a horse trail, there's a dog trail.
467	00:28:10	00:28:12	Maybe security thought this guy was just walking his dog.
468	00:28:12	00:28:13	That's how he got past them.
469	00:28:13	00:28:18	Yeah, and then once onto the Berman property, he didn't need the dog anymore, so he let her loose.
470	00:28:18	00:28:20	(whines) That's okay, sweetie.
471	00:28:20	00:28:23	Uncle Hodges is gonna adopt you when all this is over.
472	00:28:23	00:28:25	No, he's not. Uncle Greg is.
473	00:28:25	00:28:29	But I am going to scan you with my ARF-ID Reader.
474	00:28:31	00:28:33	Shelter dog.
475	00:28:33	00:28:35	Rescued into a life of crime.
476	00:28:35	00:28:37	Okay, get a shot of her for me, will you?
477	00:28:37	00:28:39	Yeah.
478	00:28:39	00:28:40	Say cheese, sweetie.
479	00:28:40	00:28:42	Cheese, sweetie.
480	00:28:44	00:28:46	Got your text. What do you got?
481	00:28:46	00:28:47	Well, this is a first.
482	00:28:47	00:28:50	Our killer adopted a death-imminent mongrel dog.
483	00:28:50	00:28:52	You know, a mutt. But he made a mistake.
484	00:28:52	00:28:54	He left a copy of his driver's license at the dog pound.
485	00:28:54	00:28:58	The information is bogus, but the girl at the counter I.D.'d the photo.
486	00:28:58	00:28:59	So I'm looking at our killer.
487	00:28:59	00:29:04	It gets better. Nick saw a security camera in the parking lot of the animal shelter.
488	00:29:04	00:29:06	We ran the plate.
489	00:29:06	00:29:07	Rental? Affirmative.
490	00:29:07	00:29:11	Time to LoJack this jackass.
491	00:29:11	00:29:14	Control, this is Two Zero Three Charlie, Captain Brass.
492	00:29:14	00:29:16	We're at the LoJack-identified site.
493	00:29:16	00:29:20	Eyes on a silver Ford. Nevada plates Adam, King, Sam, Henry, Four, One, Three.
494	00:29:22	00:29:24	Key's still in the ignition, Jim.
495	00:29:28	00:29:32	Well, you have evidence but no one to tie it to.
496	00:29:32	00:29:33	He knew that.
497	00:29:36	00:29:40	That's why he left it all behind.
498	00:29:42	00:29:45	Ballistics confirmed that's the murder weapon.
499	00:29:45	00:29:47	No prints. No DNA.
500	00:29:47	00:29:49	We tracked down Berman's jeweler.
501	00:29:49	00:29:50	He's the one who identified the ring.
502	00:29:50	00:29:52	Five-carat rock.
503	00:29:52	00:29:54	Great payday for a killer.
504	00:29:54	00:29:55	Untraceable.
505	00:29:55	00:29:58	I also processed the disposable phone.
506	00:29:59	00:30:03	one from an animal shelter and one from a rental car agency.
507	00:30:03	00:30:07	The only thing probative, really, is the video.
508	00:30:07	00:30:10	Wait, there's a video on a disposable cell phone?
509	00:30:10	00:30:11	Oh, yeah.
510	00:30:11	00:30:14	Play it.
511	00:30:40	00:30:43	You okay?
512	00:30:43	00:30:45	I missed it.
513	00:30:46	00:30:48	Hey, slow down, will you?
514	00:30:48	00:30:49	What did you miss?
515	00:30:49	00:30:51	Something on that snuff film?
516	00:30:51	00:30:59	It's not a snuff film; it's proof of kill sent by the hit man to the deep Web to create a résumé in cyberspace so he gets hired for future hits.
517	00:30:59	00:31:02	Wait... (exhales) You're saying that the guy who created Kitty is a hit man?
518	00:31:02	00:31:05	No. No, no, no.
519	00:31:05	00:31:07	The man who created Kitty is a psycho-sadist.
520	00:31:07	00:31:10	He derives pleasure from inflicting pain to others.
521	00:31:10	00:31:13	He would never tape himself killing somebody.
522	00:31:13	00:31:14	He is the one I'm after.
523	00:31:14	00:31:16	Don't you see?
524	00:31:16	00:31:19	My psycho-sadist hired your hit man.
525	00:31:19	00:31:21	So your Node...
526	00:31:21	00:31:23	Was never even in Vegas. And that's what I missed.
527	00:31:23	00:31:25	So now we're looking for two ghosts.
528	00:31:25	00:31:28	Mine is underground, and yours is halfway around the world.
529	00:31:39	00:31:40	Brass called Interpol.
530	00:31:40	00:31:43	They put out a worldwide broadcast on our hit man.
531	00:31:43	00:31:46	Hopefully they'll get a bead on him so they can drag his ass back to Vegas.
532	00:31:46	00:31:48	When's the last time you changed your profile picture?
533	00:31:48	00:31:51	I don't know, probably after I shaved my beard off.
534	00:31:51	00:31:53	Good, you're controlling your self-image.
535	00:31:53	00:31:54	So's he.
536	00:31:54	00:31:58	Before Nebula1 was a smiley face, this is what he looked like.
537	00:31:58	00:32:04	(laughs) Oh, yeah, that rates really high on the creepy meter.
538	00:32:04	00:32:06	Nebula1-- what's that all about?
539	00:32:06	00:32:08	Nebula means dark mist.
540	00:32:08	00:32:09	He thinks he's beyond our reach.
541	00:32:09	00:32:11	Tell me, what do you see?
542	00:32:11	00:32:13	The obvious? Um...
543	00:32:13	00:32:21	Caucasian male, 20s, button-up shirt, books, family photos, window, blinds. And from what I can tell, it's nighttime.
544	00:32:21	00:32:23	Put it in context.
545	00:32:23	00:32:26	Barbells on the floor. Guy works out.
546	00:32:26	00:32:28	He's antisocial. He doesn't like the gym.
547	00:32:28	00:32:30	Yeah, and he doesn't like to take out the trash, either.
548	00:32:32	00:32:34	(short chuckle) Cans are stuffed.
549	00:32:34	00:32:36	To-go cups, food containers.
550	00:32:36	00:32:38	He orders in a lot. He's agoraphobic.
551	00:32:38	00:32:40	He doesn't like to leave, not even to eat.
552	00:32:40	00:32:41	Well, we need to I.D. him, right?
553	00:32:41	00:32:44	Guy's got a lot of family photos there.
554	00:32:44	00:32:46	If they were his family.
555	00:32:46	00:32:47	What do you mean?
556	00:32:47	00:32:51	Blood is thicker than water, but it's not thicker than a watermark.
557	00:32:51	00:32:52	Back up the bus.
558	00:32:52	00:32:54	He downloaded a fake family?
559	00:32:54	00:32:56	Everything you see here is staged.
560	00:32:56	00:32:58	Family photos communicate that he's a good person.
561	00:32:58	00:33:03	Books are supposed to make us believe that he's intelligent. Blinds are closed so we don't know where he lives.
562	00:33:03	00:33:05	Hmm.
563	00:33:05	00:33:07	Why did you say it was nighttime?
564	00:33:07	00:33:10	I don't know. I mean, I can see stars through the blinds.
565	00:33:10	00:33:11	What, he stage those too?
566	00:33:11	00:33:13	No. No. That's an oversight.
567	00:33:16	00:33:18	It's gestalt theory of continuation.
568	00:33:23	00:33:24	Looks like an arch.
569	00:33:24	00:33:26	It's the Gateway Arch.
570	00:33:26	00:33:27	He's in St. Louis.
571	00:33:27	00:33:29	I'll triangulate coordinates.
572	00:33:37	00:33:38	Clear!
573	00:33:39	00:33:42	Clear! Clear? What do you mean, clear?
574	00:33:42	00:33:43	No suspect on the premises.
575	00:33:43	00:33:46	Ma'am, you need to see this.
576	00:33:48	00:33:50	We've got a whole nerve center here.
577	00:33:50	00:33:53	Computers, hard drives, the works.
578	00:33:53	00:33:59	Oh, looks like he's still in business, but if he never leaves the house, then where is he?
579	00:33:59	00:34:00	Give me the ceiling.
580	00:34:00	00:34:01	All four corners.
581	00:34:07	00:34:08	He's got a Web cam!
582	00:34:08	00:34:09	He's watching us! It's a trap!
583	00:34:09	00:34:10	Get out! Extract! Extract!
584	00:34:10	00:34:12	Go! Go! Everybody out! Go!
585	00:34:24	00:34:27	Figured I'd find you out here.
586	00:34:32	00:34:35	Hey, you saved all those men's lives today.
587	00:34:35	00:34:39	Unfortunately, the evidence didn't fare so well.
588	00:34:39	00:34:41	We lost DNA, prints.
589	00:34:41	00:34:44	All the hardware was incinerated.
590	00:34:46	00:34:49	Oh. Is that right, D.B.?
591	00:34:49	00:34:51	Well, yes, Avery, it is.
592	00:34:51	00:34:57	I found a photo of Susan's house on her phone.
593	00:34:57	00:35:00	She never posted it to Friend Agenda.
594	00:35:00	00:35:02	If I upload it, he'll know where she lives.
595	00:35:02	00:35:04	You're thinking of putting her in play?
596	00:35:04	00:35:06	I applied some pressure.
597	00:35:06	00:35:09	I got an agoraphobe to leave his house.
598	00:35:09	00:35:11	We could lure him.
599	00:35:11	00:35:14	He is moveable.
600	00:35:14	00:35:17	And now you want to move him again and use Susan to do it.
601	00:35:19	00:35:21	But you're on the fence about it?
602	00:35:21	00:35:23	The Internet amplifies crime.
603	00:35:23	00:35:27	If my Node gets away with this, his cyber cred will be immortalized.
604	00:35:27	00:35:30	He will spawn hundreds, if not thousands, of copycatters.
605	00:35:30	00:35:34	So it's Susan versus the greater good.
606	00:35:34	00:35:41	I looked that woman in the eye, and I promised her I would protect her.
607	00:35:41	00:35:44	We are talking about a woman and two little girls.
608	00:35:47	00:35:49	Do you want my opinion?
609	00:35:53	00:35:57	Greater good. Put her in play.
610	00:35:57	00:35:59	I've got you covered.
611	00:36:08	00:36:13	(camera shutters clicking) My name is Susan McDowell.
612	00:36:13	00:36:17	My husband's a Marine proudly serving in Afghanistan.
613	00:36:17	00:36:20	I am a mother of two girls.
614	00:36:20	00:36:24	I thought I was tough, that I could handle anything.
615	00:36:24	00:36:40	Then someone hacked into my life, hijacked all my photos online, used my likeness, my face, my body, put me on the Internet, where I was virtually raped by thousands of men.
616	00:36:40	00:36:42	There is no law against what this man did to me.
617	00:36:42	00:36:44	There is no law against what this man did to me.
618	00:36:44	00:36:46	But I was violated.
619	00:36:46	00:36:48	Virtual rape...
620	00:36:48	00:36:49	...is rape.
621	00:36:49	00:36:51	And I refuse to stand back and do nothing.
622	00:36:51	00:36:53	And I refuse to stand by and do nothing.
623	00:36:57	00:37:00	Susan, you can do this.
624	00:37:00	00:37:03	The difference between a victim and victory is action.
625	00:37:03	00:37:06	Take back your life.
626	00:37:06	00:37:09	Provoke him, expose him for what he is.
627	00:37:10	00:37:12	You see this?
628	00:37:12	00:37:15	This is what he turned me into.
629	00:37:15	00:37:17	A whore, a prostitute.
630	00:37:17	00:37:23	He's selling my body to thousands of men around the world 24/7.
631	00:37:23	00:37:25	As of today, I'm shutting you down.
632	00:37:25	00:37:28	And so here's my message to all you men out there.
633	00:37:28	00:37:31	Log off and check into your families.
634	00:37:31	00:37:33	Don't let this coward win.
635	00:37:37	00:37:38	Well done, Susan.
636	00:37:38	00:37:44	Agent Ryan, I've been tracking Nebula1's activity on Friend Agenda since you announced her press conference.
637	00:37:44	00:37:48	In the last hour, he's peeped her page 900,000 times.
638	00:37:48	00:37:50	He D.O.S.'d her?
639	00:37:50	00:37:52	He's so angry, he crashed her site.
640	00:37:52	00:37:55	You wanted obsession. You got it.
641	00:37:57	00:37:58	We're going to San Diego.
642	00:38:34	00:38:36	You're a cop.
643	00:38:38	00:38:40	You're a sadist.
644	00:38:40	00:38:42	Where's Kitty?
645	00:38:42	00:38:44	You mean Susan?
646	00:38:44	00:38:46	You're confused.
647	00:38:46	00:38:49	Susan is real; Kitty is not.
648	00:38:49	00:38:51	I created Kitty.
649	00:38:51	00:38:53	I made her.
650	00:38:53	00:38:55	I'm not gonna ask you again.
651	00:38:59	00:39:01	Is that a .45?
652	00:39:06	00:39:08	I guarantee you it's never been fired.
653	00:39:10	00:39:13	I've had bigger guns pointed at my face.
654	00:39:13	00:39:16	Wait till you see my other gun.
655	00:39:16	00:39:17	I saw it.
656	00:39:17	00:39:20	The one your hit man used to kill Audrey Berman?
657	00:39:20	00:39:23	I thought I'd do this one myself.
658	00:39:23	00:39:25	I thought you'd be more of a blade man.
659	00:39:35	00:39:37	She just got him to trade down.
660	00:39:37	00:39:39	How long are we gonna play this waiting game?
661	00:39:39	00:39:41	We wait for Agent Ryan's code word.
662	00:39:47	00:39:50	You going to cut me?
663	00:40:00	00:40:02	You like to watch me bleed?
664	00:40:04	00:40:05	Yeah.
665	00:40:06	00:40:08	You want me to cut you again?
666	00:40:08	00:40:09	Are you hearing that?
667	00:40:09	00:40:12	Yeah. She's adding years to his sentence.
668	00:40:12	00:40:14	Tell me about the first time.
669	00:40:14	00:40:18	I was eight years old...
670	00:40:18	00:40:22	and I cut my sister's breasts with a straight razor.
671	00:40:24	00:40:26	I got no problem cutting you.
672	00:40:28	00:40:30	Well, I do.
673	00:40:30	00:40:31	I'm out of here.
674	00:40:31	00:40:34	You're not going anywhere!
675	00:40:35	00:40:37	Have you ever been murdered before?
676	00:40:40	00:40:42	Mushroom.
677	00:40:49	00:40:51	Drop it!
678	00:40:51	00:40:53	Drop it! Drop it!
679	00:40:55	00:40:57	Stay down!
680	00:40:57	00:41:06	Stay down! You're under arrest for attempted murder of a federal agent, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, and a thousand counts of being a creep.
681	00:41:06	00:41:09	Say bye-bye to your Wi-Fi.
682	00:41:10	00:41:11	You all right?
683	00:41:13	00:41:16	I'll feel a lot better when you get our hit man behind bars.
684	00:41:16	00:41:18	You're something else.
685	00:41:19	00:41:21	Oh, my God.
686	00:41:23	00:41:25	Thank you so much for bringing us down here.
687	00:41:25	00:41:27	The girls are so excited.
688	00:41:28	00:41:30	They want to be pilots just like their dad.
689	00:41:32	00:41:34	Girls!
690	00:41:35	00:41:37	Daddy! Daddy!
691	00:41:39	00:41:41	You brought my husband home?
692	00:41:41	00:41:45	After all you've been through, you both deserve a hero's welcome.
693	00:41:47	00:41:48	Thank you.
694	00:41:55	00:41:56	That was nice.
695	00:41:56	00:41:59	So this is good-bye, I guess, huh?
696	00:41:59	00:42:01	Well, for now.
697	00:42:01	00:42:03	Where you off to?
698	00:42:03	00:42:05	Oh, bank robbery, Pittsburgh.
699	00:42:05	00:42:07	How much? Three cents.
700	00:42:07	00:42:09	Oh, give me a break. Talk to me. How much?
