0	00:00:17	00:00:19	Stop! Stop!
1	00:00:19	00:00:22	Stop!
2	00:00:45	00:00:46	Why do we always come here?
3	00:00:46	00:00:48	Open 24 hours.
4	00:00:48	00:00:50	Everything in Vegas is open 24 hours.
5	00:00:50	00:00:51	It's cheap.
6	00:00:51	00:00:53	Smells like bacon in here.
7	00:00:53	00:00:54	Slide over.
8	00:00:54	00:00:56	That scene took forever.
9	00:00:56	00:00:58	We were there like, what, nine hours?
10	00:00:58	00:00:59	Eleven.
11	00:00:59	00:01:02	A dead lawyer and 200 eyewitnesses-- it's going to take a while.
12	00:01:03	00:01:06	Come for a wedding, stay for the funeral.
13	00:01:06	00:01:08	Why do we always eat here?
14	00:01:08	00:01:09	It's tradition.
15	00:01:09	00:01:10	Ah, tradition.
16	00:01:10	00:01:14	Like becoming property exchange between your father and your husband?
17	00:01:14	00:01:16	Oh, that's not what a wedding is.
18	00:01:16	00:01:18	It's a public declaration of love.
19	00:01:18	00:01:19	I'm with Vince Vaughn on this one.
20	00:01:19	00:01:23	Dozens of horny, single women with access to an open bar and coupling on their mind.
21	00:01:24	00:01:26	Weddings are a Rorschach.
22	00:01:26	00:01:28	Everybody sees what they want to see.
23	00:01:28	00:01:29	My first five were good.
24	00:01:29	00:01:33	Noted criminal defense attorney, Diane Chase was killed yesterday...
25	00:01:33	00:01:37	We haven't even gone back to the lab yet, and we're already on TV.
26	00:01:37	00:01:42	In a tragic twist, Ms. Chase was killed while attending her son's wedding.
27	00:01:42	00:01:51	She was best known for taking on the toughest cases, and it was her defense of high-profile, organized crime associates that really made her a name in legal circles.
28	00:01:51	00:01:54	If it was an intelligent question, I'd stop to answer it.
29	00:01:54	00:02:05	Most recently, she represented Dino Fatelli of the Fatelli crime family, who was sentenced to life last month for the brutal slaying of casino mogul Remy James.
30	00:02:05	00:02:08	The stones on these guys-- to take her out at her son's wedding?
31	00:02:08	00:02:10	Pass the cream, will you?
32	00:02:17	00:02:20	Dude, where's your car?
33	00:02:20	00:02:22	It's parked right...
34	00:02:35	00:02:36	Incoming.
35	00:02:36	00:02:39	I'll talk. You guys just look apologetic.
36	00:02:41	00:02:45	All right, let me see if I understand this correctly.
37	00:02:45	00:03:05	You let one of the members of your team drive his personal vehicle to a crime scene investigation; and then, even though there was a perfectly good crime scene vehicle there, that personal car was crammed with every bit of evidence collected at a major murder investigation, because two of you were maxed out on overtime.
38	00:03:05	00:03:15	And then the driver, of said car, instead of securing that evidence in the lab, gave priority to his need for runny eggs.
39	00:03:15	00:03:22	And the aforementioned vehicle was stolen from a parking lot filled with police cars.
40	00:03:23	00:03:25	Is there anything I missed?
41	00:03:25	00:03:32	Just this Even if we recover the vehicle, the chain of custody has been broken, so all the evidence has been compromised.
42	00:03:32	00:03:35	No judge will allow any of it to be admitted into court.
43	00:03:35	00:03:41	Also, we released the crime scene, so it, too, is compromised, leaving us nothing to go back for.
44	00:03:41	00:03:44	Thank you for clarifying the situation.
45	00:03:48	00:03:49	It could've been worse.
46	00:04:27	00:04:30	We were seated at a booth, with clear visual access to the vehicle.
47	00:04:30	00:04:32	A delivery truck pulls up, blocks our view.
48	00:04:32	00:04:34	For how long?
49	00:04:34	00:04:36	Two, three minutes, tops.
50	00:04:36	00:04:37	What kind of truck?
51	00:04:37	00:04:40	Bread, dairy... I can't remember.
52	00:04:40	00:04:42	Did you have an alarm?
53	00:04:42	00:04:44	Yeah. Yeah, it didn't go off.
54	00:04:44	00:04:45	Are you sure it was locked?
55	00:04:45	00:04:46	Yeah, absolutely.
56	00:04:46	00:04:48	And I have a tracking system on my truck, too.
57	00:04:48	00:04:50	I called it in as soon as I realized it was missing.
58	00:04:50	00:04:54	Okay. I'll follow up. There's about a dozen places to hide a tracking system on a car.
59	00:04:54	00:04:55	I'm sure the Fatellis know 'em all.
60	00:04:55	00:04:57	No broken glass.
61	00:04:57	00:05:00	No bolts from a disengaged transmission.
62	00:05:00	00:05:02	No tire treads or skid marks.
63	00:05:02	00:05:04	Hey, Jim.
64	00:05:05	00:05:08	I need a ride.
65	00:05:13	00:05:17	Internal Affairs Bureau is coming to take our statements.
66	00:05:17	00:05:18	They'll want to know what's been lost.
67	00:05:18	00:05:23	So let's not make ourselves look any worse than we already do.
68	00:05:23	00:05:27	Write down everything-- evidence collected, interview notes, etc... Every detail.
69	00:05:27	00:05:30	No one leaves until they've given their account of the event.
70	00:05:43	00:05:47	So aside from the accident, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?
71	00:05:47	00:05:48	Not good.
72	00:05:48	00:05:49	Fatelli was handled by the day shift.
73	00:05:49	00:05:51	Let's pull the file.
74	00:05:51	00:05:52	And compare it to what?
75	00:05:52	00:05:53	We've got no crime scene photos.
76	00:05:53	00:05:56	I have mine, but they're only of the ballroom.
77	00:05:56	00:05:58	But every wedding these days has a videographer.
78	00:05:58	00:06:00	We got to get the video.
79	00:06:58	00:06:59	Oh. Hey, Grissom.
80	00:06:59	00:07:02	I'm sorry to hear about the setback.
81	00:07:02	00:07:05	Yeah, well, it's all about the body now, David.
82	00:07:05	00:07:10	There was a vital response in the ligature marks around her ankles.
83	00:07:10	00:07:14	So she might have been unconscious, but she probably was still alive when she was tied to the car.
84	00:07:14	00:07:17	Yeah, all the significant trauma was to the back of her head.
85	00:07:17	00:07:19	We'll know more after autopsy.
86	00:07:19	00:07:22	So you tell me how I'm going to spin this thing.
87	00:07:22	00:07:27	I've got a dead lawyer, a known enemy of the department, who made her career picking us apart.
88	00:07:27	00:07:29	And now, we've lost the evidence in her murder.
89	00:07:29	00:07:31	Even I don't buy it.
90	00:07:31	00:07:33	The Fatellis are on our radar.
91	00:07:33	00:07:35	Press is going to eat us alive.
92	00:07:35	00:07:38	Six month trial, we finally get Fatelli shipped off to Lompoc.
93	00:07:38	00:07:40	He's not even in the state.
94	00:07:40	00:07:42	How long are his arms?
95	00:07:42	00:07:43	I talked to the feds.
96	00:07:43	00:07:45	They're checking the call logs, visitors' logs.
97	00:07:45	00:07:48	It's going to look like the CSIs were paid off.
98	00:07:48	00:07:52	Nobody's going to believe that this was an unfortunate series of coincidences.
99	00:07:52	00:07:55	we're idiots, or we're dirty.
100	00:07:55	00:07:57	So which are we?
101	00:07:57	00:07:58	It was a big scene.
102	00:07:58	00:08:02	I threw tons of stuff into the back of your truck.
103	00:08:02	00:08:04	Figured I'd just sort it out later.
104	00:08:04	00:08:06	Print lifts, swabs, my camera.
105	00:08:06	00:08:11	Well, maybe if we talk it out, it will help.
106	00:08:11	00:08:14	I started with the Just Married convertible.
107	00:08:14	00:08:17	Well, thankfully, that didn't get stolen. Where is it?
108	00:08:17	00:08:23	Because of possible Fatelli involvement, the undersheriff ordered it swept at the scene before they brought it back to the lab.
109	00:08:23	00:08:24	It could be hours.
110	00:08:24	00:08:26	Did you get anything from it?
111	00:08:26	00:08:29	Prints...
112	00:08:32	00:08:34	I remember David saying...
113	00:08:34	00:08:40	You'd think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.
114	00:08:40	00:08:47	So there we were at Cupid's Kiss, a Nuptial Neverland where the cheese factor was dangerously high and the flowers were obviously fake.
115	00:08:52	00:08:56	Can the love be real when the flowers aren't?
116	00:09:07	00:09:11	Oh, you really have a thing about weddings, don't you?
117	00:09:11	00:09:13	Hey, I didn't interview them.
118	00:09:13	00:09:14	It was just my impression.
119	00:09:20	00:09:22	Hi, there. Hi.
120	00:09:22	00:09:23	I'm, uh, Sara Sidle.
121	00:09:23	00:09:24	I'm with the crime lab.
122	00:09:24	00:09:26	Bryce Gundy, groom's side.
123	00:09:26	00:09:30	Did you guys decorate the wedding car with those beer cans? Yep.
124	00:09:30	00:09:31	Did you drink all the beer first?
125	00:09:31	00:09:33	Yep. Awesome.
126	00:09:33	00:09:35	Did you also tie the groom's mom to the bumper?
127	00:09:35	00:09:36	Nope.
128	00:09:36	00:09:41	Um, I'm going to need to get your fingerprints so I can compare them to the prints that I got off the car.
129	00:09:41	00:09:43	Cool.
130	00:09:43	00:09:45	You are aware that someone has died?
131	00:09:45	00:09:50	Nobody's going to miss her except her son and her cell phone provider.
132	00:09:50	00:09:51	Oh, what do you mean?
133	00:09:51	00:09:53	She's creepy close to Adam.
134	00:09:53	00:09:55	Must have called him 15 times a day.
135	00:09:55	00:09:56	Huh.
136	00:09:56	00:09:59	Do you mind just putting your finger right here?
137	00:09:59	00:10:00	Oh! Okay, Mr. Gundy...
138	00:10:00	00:10:02	I think I love you.
139	00:10:02	00:10:04	Yeah, thank you. You need to sit down.
140	00:10:04	00:10:05	Have a club soda.
141	00:10:05	00:10:10	Um, um, excuse me, you dropped this.
142	00:10:10	00:10:11	Sorry about him. ( laughing )
143	00:10:11	00:10:13	Why do the jerks get all the tail?
144	00:10:13	00:10:16	Sara Sidle, crime lab.
145	00:10:16	00:10:20	I'm, uh, Mikey. Best man. Brother of the bride.
146	00:10:20	00:10:22	Yeah, it's, you know. Yeah.
147	00:10:22	00:10:24	Hey, this is a pretty crazy-ass situation, huh?
148	00:10:24	00:10:28	They say it's good luck if it rains on your wedding day.
149	00:10:28	00:10:29	What do you think about a dead body?
150	00:10:29	00:10:31	What do you think?
151	00:10:31	00:10:33	I think my sister's better off.
152	00:10:33	00:10:35	You ever think about getting married?
153	00:10:35	00:10:39	Um... I'm just saying, you know, I think Bryce could make an honest woman out of you.
154	00:10:40	00:10:42	Oh, look at that-- your rejection broke his little heart.
155	00:10:42	00:10:44	Should I put flirting in the case file?
156	00:10:44	00:10:47	I was printing.
157	00:10:47	00:10:50	He was flirting.
158	00:10:50	00:10:56	Uni found the tracking device from Nick's car in a trash can, a couple blocks from the diner.
159	00:10:56	00:10:57	Pro job.
160	00:10:57	00:10:59	Has it been to Prints? Well, no.
161	00:10:59	00:11:02	But if it was the Fatellis, it's going to be clean.
162	00:11:02	00:11:06	Yeah. Nick's truck has no street value.
163	00:11:06	00:11:08	The value was what was inside.
164	00:11:22	00:11:23	Did you get a number?
165	00:11:23	00:11:27	No. No, I didn't get anything.
166	00:11:27	00:11:28	She must have put it in my pocket.
167	00:11:28	00:11:30	Mindy.
168	00:11:31	00:11:35	You think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.
169	00:11:40	00:11:43	The perfume of American beauties was everywhere.
170	00:11:43	00:11:50	Though a rose by any other name would have smelled just as sweet on a day with that much love in the air.
171	00:12:03	00:12:05	Ladies, hi, how you doing?
172	00:12:05	00:12:06	Hi. Hi.
173	00:12:06	00:12:08	I'm with the crime lab. My name's Nick Stokes.
174	00:12:08	00:12:10	I'm going to need to print you both, okay?
175	00:12:10	00:12:14	Mindy Faberge. Bride's side.
176	00:12:15	00:12:16	Um, can we go in and change.
177	00:12:16	00:12:19	I can't get warm.
178	00:12:19	00:12:21	Cindy Jansen. I think she's still in shock.
179	00:12:21	00:12:23	You were in the wedding party.
180	00:12:23	00:12:26	Did you spend most of the day here with Ms. Chase?
181	00:12:27	00:12:29	She was on her best behavior.
182	00:12:29	00:12:31	Outside that toast she gave.
183	00:12:31	00:12:33	There you go. Thank you.
184	00:12:33	00:12:36	Um, well, I think that was the alcohol talking.
185	00:12:36	00:12:39	So, she was a drinker?
186	00:12:39	00:12:45	By the end of the toast, she was slurring her words and swaying all over the place.
187	00:12:45	00:12:49	I almost felt bad for her.
188	00:12:49	00:12:53	Anyone interested in the wedding DVD?
189	00:12:53	00:12:54	Yeah. ( all agreeing )
190	00:12:54	00:13:00	Courtesy of Frank Rosetti, owner of Cupid's Kiss.
191	00:13:05	00:13:07	All right, where do you want to start?
192	00:13:07	00:13:09	The toast.
193	00:13:13	00:13:16	Everyone...
194	00:13:16	00:13:18	Everyone.
195	00:13:18	00:13:20	I want to thank your for coming.
196	00:13:20	00:13:31	You know, the Bible says, Love is strong as death, and as mother of the groom, a wedding is bittersweet.
197	00:13:31	00:13:35	You are giving up as much as you are gaining.
198	00:13:35	00:13:45	In some cases you are giving... Oh... up much more.
199	00:13:49	00:13:51	To hell with it.
200	00:13:51	00:13:53	I'll wing it.
201	00:13:56	00:13:58	My Adam...
202	00:13:58	00:14:01	He studied at Oxford.
203	00:14:01	00:14:04	He went to Harvard School of Business.
204	00:14:04	00:14:15	And of all the intelligent, wonderful, beautiful women he met along the way, he ended up with Jill.
205	00:14:15	00:14:19	Plain, little Jill.
206	00:14:22	00:14:24	There's nothing wrong with her.
207	00:14:24	00:14:26	But what's right with her?
208	00:14:26	00:14:28	I mean, even her name is boring.
209	00:14:30	00:14:35	Adam, it's all right to take a lover.
210	00:14:35	00:14:40	You just don't have to end up marrying her.
211	00:14:40	00:14:45	I mean, do you really want to shallow our gene pool like this?
212	00:14:45	00:14:47	Oh...
213	00:14:47	00:14:51	Oh, I want to thank you all so much for coming.
214	00:14:51	00:14:53	Oh, I love you, Adam.
215	00:14:53	00:14:56	Hey, hey, good comedy, Diane...
216	00:14:56	00:14:58	Justifiable homicide?
217	00:15:03	00:15:04	Thank you all for coming.
218	00:15:06	00:15:09	I love you, Adam.
219	00:15:09	00:15:11	You talked to the bride.
220	00:15:11	00:15:13	This seems like motive.
221	00:15:13	00:15:14	Do you think she did it?
222	00:15:15	00:15:16	When would she have had the time?
223	00:15:17	00:15:22	You'd think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.
224	00:15:26	00:15:31	Spring is but a song, where love and laughter are not wrong.
225	00:15:31	00:15:37	The blossoms of desire do belong, and Harmonia axyridis fly along.
226	00:15:43	00:15:48	For the past six months, she made my life hell.
227	00:15:48	00:15:54	And so I told anyone who'd listen that she should die a fiery death.
228	00:15:54	00:15:57	So now everyone's going to think that I killed her.
229	00:15:57	00:15:59	Would you like to be more specific?
230	00:15:59	00:16:08	Okay, well, when we got engaged, she ran into the backyard and she screamed, Why, God? Why me?
231	00:16:08	00:16:10	Okay, she wore white today.
232	00:16:10	00:16:18	She invited Adam's very, very attractive, very, um, single ex-girlfriend.
233	00:16:18	00:16:27	When she found out that I had registered for sporting goods, she went behind my back and she changed the registry to housewares, saying that I'd better learn how to cook, okay?
234	00:16:27	00:16:31	I'm a vegetarian, and she demanded roast beef.
235	00:16:32	00:16:35	Um... Oh, and then... then there's the toast.
236	00:16:35	00:16:37	The... the toast.
237	00:16:37	00:16:40	Are you trying to make me think that you didn't kill her?
238	00:16:40	00:16:44	I would never do that to Adam.
239	00:16:44	00:16:51	I honestly don't know how such an amazing man came from-from... that.
240	00:16:51	00:16:53	Look, it wasn't just me, okay?
241	00:16:53	00:16:56	She fought with everyone today.
242	00:16:56	00:17:03	She fought with the valets and the bridesmaids and the waiters.
243	00:17:03	00:17:06	The caterer-- I thought for sure he was going to poison her.
244	00:17:06	00:17:07	Want to see a crime scene?
245	00:17:08	00:17:10	I'll show you a crime scene. Come here. Come here.
246	00:17:10	00:17:11	Look at this, huh?
247	00:17:11	00:17:15	What this woman had against the color peach-- I've never seen anything like it.
248	00:17:15	00:17:20	If you think you're serving that flesh-colored abomination, and I'm paying for it, you can think again! Boom!
249	00:17:20	00:17:22	I'm a 42-year-old paisan. She scared me.
250	00:17:22	00:17:26	I wouldn't be surprised if her pantyhose rebelled against her and tied themselves to the car.
251	00:17:26	00:17:28	The dame was a pill.
252	00:17:28	00:17:32	I swear to God, she may have taken two or three years off my own life.
253	00:17:32	00:17:35	Weddings are a blood, sweat and tears marathon, my friend.
254	00:17:35	00:17:36	I'm on a tight schedule.
255	00:17:36	00:17:38	00 noon, I got first intro of the couple.
256	00:17:38	00:17:39	30, salad course.
257	00:17:39	00:17:41	45, first dance.
258	00:17:41	00:17:45	00, chair dance, chicken dance, broom dance-- I don't care. I'm equal opportunity.
259	00:17:45	00:17:46	30, main course.
260	00:17:46	00:17:48	15, first toast groom's side.
261	00:17:48	00:17:53	16 we have the first toast on the bride's side.
262	00:17:53	00:17:56	00, we cut the cake. 3 That's a tight schedule.
263	00:17:56	00:17:59	She would have barely had time to go to the bathroom.
264	00:17:59	00:18:01	I don't sell bridal diapers for nothing.
265	00:18:01	00:18:04	He was kidding about the diapers, right?
266	00:18:06	00:18:09	You're way too pretty to be a cop.
267	00:18:10	00:18:13	I need to ask you about your brother, Dino Fatelli.
268	00:18:14	00:18:16	Dino always was the bad seed.
269	00:18:16	00:18:19	I heard you guys share the taste for blood.
270	00:18:19	00:18:25	I once was lost, but now I am found.
271	00:18:25	00:18:26	You and your brother keep in touch?
272	00:18:26	00:18:28	Yeah, yeah.
273	00:18:28	00:18:31	Last thing he said was he didn't like the food at Lompoc.
274	00:18:31	00:18:33	I told him to call his lawyer.
275	00:18:33	00:18:35	It's too late now.
276	00:18:35	00:18:38	Where were you yesterday afternoon?
277	00:18:38	00:18:40	You want to crawl up my ass?
278	00:18:40	00:18:41	You can take a number.
279	00:18:41	00:18:43	No thanks.
280	00:18:43	00:18:47	50-to-one, Freddie the Feddy is out there right now talking to you guys.
281	00:18:47	00:18:49	Did you know you were made?
282	00:18:50	00:18:53	Yeah. Not even Diane Chase could keep these guys out of jail.
283	00:18:53	00:18:57	And we figure it's just a matter of time before we get something on Sylvano.
284	00:18:57	00:19:00	Like another murder?
285	00:19:00	00:19:02	Sorry.
286	00:19:02	00:19:04	He didn't kill the lawyer.
287	00:19:04	00:19:06	Runs numbers out of his bar all day.
288	00:19:06	00:19:08	Trying to pass a kidney stone.
289	00:19:08	00:19:10	Hates his wife and his girlfriend.
290	00:19:10	00:19:12	I hear everything.
291	00:19:12	00:19:14	Could order one of his guys to do it.
292	00:19:14	00:19:16	The brothers like to be hands-on.
293	00:19:17	00:19:21	And all we're hearing is them bitching about how somebody snatched their M.O...
294	00:19:23	00:19:27	Based on my dissection, I've detected two separate events.
295	00:19:27	00:19:31	I believe that this puncture wound happened first.
296	00:19:31	00:19:35	The object lacerated a cerebral artery creating a subdural hematoma.
297	00:19:35	00:19:44	Then subsequent blows to her skull, from a ride behind the car, created additional fractures which caused diffuse bleeding on the brain, resulting in her death.
298	00:19:44	00:19:46	So punctured and bobbled?
299	00:19:46	00:19:47	Yeah.
300	00:19:47	00:19:49	I autopsied the Fatellis' original victim.
301	00:19:49	00:19:50	They're sadists.
302	00:19:50	00:19:56	First Remy James is dragged behind the Cadillac, and when he wouldn't talk, they shot him in every joint.
303	00:19:56	00:20:01	And when he still wouldn't talk, they finished him off with a shot to the head.
304	00:20:01	00:20:04	The Fatellis don't mostly kill someone.
305	00:20:04	00:20:06	So you took the perimeter of the scene, right?
306	00:20:07	00:20:08	Yeah.
307	00:20:08	00:20:10	Well, I saw this guy in the shadows.
308	00:20:10	00:20:11	Archie blew it up.
309	00:20:11	00:20:14	He looks more like a suspect than a guest.
310	00:20:14	00:20:17	That face look familiar?
311	00:20:19	00:20:21	Oh, yeah.
312	00:20:21	00:20:24	Yeah, I caught that guy trying to sleep one off in the bushes.
313	00:20:24	00:20:26	That's the groom's old man.
314	00:20:26	00:20:30	Wow, I thought my wedding was bad.
315	00:20:30	00:20:31	Where is he?
316	00:20:31	00:20:34	I sent him to detox, in the tank.
317	00:20:34	00:20:38	See, that's the problem with being a deadbeat dad.
318	00:20:38	00:20:41	If you're not around for the bad times, they don't want you around for the good times.
319	00:20:41	00:20:43	I didn't... I'm not...
320	00:20:43	00:20:50	Let's just cut right through the lie-and-deny part of the chat, and I'll tell you what I know.
321	00:20:50	00:20:52	My mother was a powerful woman; she had a lot of enemies.
322	00:20:52	00:20:56	My mother and Joe worked so hard to make this day perfect.
323	00:20:56	00:20:58	It seems silly now.
324	00:20:58	00:21:00	They had a fight about the gifts, then...
325	00:21:00	00:21:03	then there was a disagreement with the bridesmaids.
326	00:21:03	00:21:05	And my mother accidentally brought the wrong dress.
327	00:21:05	00:21:09	Then the dinner was wrong, and the cake was wrong.
328	00:21:10	00:21:12	And my father showed up.
329	00:21:12	00:21:14	What, he wasn't invited?
330	00:21:14	00:21:15	Um, no.
331	00:21:15	00:21:17	My parents are divorced.
332	00:21:17	00:21:19	I think that's why today was so hard on her.
333	00:21:19	00:21:22	The wedding brought up a lot of issues for her.
334	00:21:22	00:21:25	She sacrificed so much for me.
335	00:21:25	00:21:27	Single parent, grad school.
336	00:21:27	00:21:28	She was a champion.
337	00:21:30	00:21:34	My father is... unstable.
338	00:21:34	00:21:36	For years, he's had a drug problem.
339	00:21:36	00:21:38	She told him that.
340	00:21:38	00:21:40	I don't believe that bitch!
341	00:21:40	00:21:44	You do or you don't have a drug problem? Which is it?
342	00:21:44	00:21:46	Don't take everything you see at face value.
343	00:21:49	00:21:55	15 years ago, Diane decided she wanted to go back to work.
344	00:21:55	00:21:59	And I encouraged her.
345	00:21:59	00:22:04	But then she became... driven.
346	00:22:04	00:22:06	And I was slowing her down.
347	00:22:06	00:22:07	She got nasty.
348	00:22:07	00:22:09	I got depressed.
349	00:22:09	00:22:12	I started taking antidepressants.
350	00:22:12	00:22:14	She was mortified.
351	00:22:14	00:22:15	Said it wouldn't look good.
352	00:22:15	00:22:17	I said, Hey, I'm not one of your clients.
353	00:22:17	00:22:19	I'm your husband.
354	00:22:19	00:22:22	Not anymore, she said.
355	00:22:22	00:22:25	She filed for divorce.
356	00:22:25	00:22:30	And she said it was because the drugs affected my libido.
357	00:22:30	00:22:37	We hadn't had sex for eight months before I started taking the drugs.
358	00:22:37	00:22:40	Did you have an altercation with her at the wedding?
359	00:22:40	00:22:43	Yeah. Yeah.
360	00:22:44	00:22:47	Because of the meds, I don't drink very much.
361	00:22:49	00:22:52	I did today because I thought it would take the edge off.
362	00:22:54	00:22:56	It put the edge on.
363	00:22:58	00:23:00	Good to see you.
364	00:23:00	00:23:02	Hi. How are you? It's great...
365	00:23:03	00:23:04	Excuse me.
366	00:23:07	00:23:09	You were not invited.
367	00:23:09	00:23:11	I read the papers, Diane.
368	00:23:11	00:23:13	They teach literacy at the halfway house?
369	00:23:13	00:23:15	I didn't come here to fight.
370	00:23:15	00:23:16	You're not here at all.
371	00:23:16	00:23:18	He's my son, too.
372	00:23:18	00:23:20	I wouldn't be so sure of that.
373	00:23:20	00:23:24	I stuck around to see the ceremony.
374	00:23:24	00:23:26	I even saw a little bit of the reception.
375	00:23:26	00:23:29	I was sleeping it off when your guys found me.
376	00:23:30	00:23:31	So you didn't kill her?
377	00:23:31	00:23:39	No. But you better check to see if she's really dead, because I don't think you can kill the devil.
378	00:23:41	00:23:43	Nick, you drew Mr. Chase's blood at the scene.
379	00:23:43	00:23:44	His BAC was .28.
380	00:23:45	00:23:46	00 p.m.
381	00:23:46	00:23:50	And officers drew it again at the station an hour later. It was .22.
382	00:23:50	00:23:52	So he was in the elimination phase.
383	00:23:52	00:23:56	That means, when the victim was tied to the car, his blood alcohol level was even higher.
384	00:23:56	00:23:58	Mr. Chase was blotto.
385	00:23:58	00:24:00	He couldn't have tied his own shoes.
386	00:24:00	00:24:05	Assuming whoever took your truck is the killer, Mr. Chase was in the tank. He couldn't have done it.
387	00:24:05	00:24:07	One suspect down.
388	00:24:07	00:24:12	Speaking of downers, Ms. Chase liked her diazepam.
389	00:24:12	00:24:15	Blood levels were somewhere between therapeutic and toxic.
390	00:24:15	00:24:21	That's... that's weird. Her ex-husband told Brass she was very anti-psychopharmaceuticals.
391	00:24:21	00:24:26	As a toxicology tech, I'd say often those who adamantly oppose the D-train are its most frequent passengers.
392	00:24:26	00:24:29	But, since she is deceased, I was able to get her medical records.
393	00:24:29	00:24:32	No diazepam scrip.
394	00:24:32	00:24:35	So she got daffy on someone else's pills.
395	00:24:35	00:24:38	That explains Mindy's account of her behavior.
396	00:24:38	00:24:39	And the toast.
397	00:24:39	00:24:43	Doesn't explain how she was conked out, tied to a bumper.
398	00:24:44	00:24:46	I might know what happened.
399	00:24:46	00:24:50	You'd think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.
400	00:24:52	00:24:56	A dame was dead, but enough about her.
401	00:24:56	00:25:00	The air was hot and heavy with wrong, making me thirsty.
402	00:25:00	00:25:02	Thirsty for a tall drink of water.
403	00:25:02	00:25:07	That's when I saw her-- a flower-- but not the kind you pin on a lapel.
404	00:25:07	00:25:09	She was long-stemmed.
405	00:25:09	00:25:12	All right, Raymond Chandler, we get it.
406	00:25:16	00:25:18	And those weren't just Miracle Bras.
407	00:25:18	00:25:20	They were creating four Wonders of the World.
408	00:25:20	00:25:23	I'm Greg Sanders, with the crime lab.
409	00:25:24	00:25:26	I need to take your prints.
410	00:25:27	00:25:30	That's quite a case you got there.
411	00:25:30	00:25:31	Is that your magic kit?
412	00:25:31	00:25:32	Or your toy box?
413	00:25:32	00:25:35	You don't seem to be very upset about what happened.
414	00:25:35	00:25:39	Sweetheart, I've had so many martinis, I'm both shaken and stirred.
415	00:25:39	00:25:40	Numbing the pain?
416	00:25:40	00:25:43	Look, we're not going to pretend to be all liquid and soft, okay?
417	00:25:43	00:25:45	All that's missing here are the striped socks.
418	00:25:45	00:25:46	Ding, dong, the witch is dead.
419	00:25:46	00:25:48	So you're not a fan?
420	00:25:48	00:25:50	Cruella made me wear underwear today.
421	00:25:50	00:25:52	No one makes me wear underwear.
422	00:25:52	00:25:55	I'll do you if you do me.
423	00:25:57	00:25:59	They did not.
424	00:26:00	00:26:03	So how does that help explain how Diane Chase died?
425	00:26:03	00:26:04	I'm getting there.
426	00:26:04	00:26:07	Okay, ladies, let's slow it down.
427	00:26:07	00:26:10	When was the last time you saw Diane?
428	00:26:10	00:26:11	In the hospitality suite.
429	00:26:11	00:26:13	I came in to fix my hair.
430	00:26:13	00:26:14	She was complaining of a headache.
431	00:26:14	00:26:17	Next time I saw her, it was bottoms up, Mommie Dearest.
432	00:26:22	00:26:26	So I headed behind the pink curtain, where the girls go to get glossy.
433	00:26:43	00:26:46	A little shine here, a little pouf there.
434	00:26:47	00:26:48	A little...
435	00:26:48	00:26:54	Well, I don't exactly know what that was, but I liked the feel.
436	00:26:58	00:27:01	Marriage was looking like a lucrative endeavor.
437	00:27:08	00:27:09	And that's when I saw it.
438	00:27:13	00:27:15	Just a few drops.
439	00:27:15	00:27:21	I thought the blood could have been incidental-- nosebleed, shaving accident.
440	00:27:29	00:27:37	But, what if, high as a kite on a slipped Mickey, she slips-- and bam!-- straight to the back of the skull?
441	00:27:37	00:27:40	The arrow was four-sided.
442	00:27:40	00:27:44	It would leave a diamond-shaped wound.
443	00:27:44	00:27:46	They match.
444	00:27:46	00:27:53	If the initial wound was accidental, why was she panty-hosed to the back of a car?
445	00:27:53	00:27:54	Don't know yet.
446	00:27:54	00:27:58	Narrows the field of suspects down to someone who had access to that suite.
447	00:27:58	00:28:00	Where's the statue?
448	00:28:00	00:28:01	In your car.
449	00:28:01	00:28:03	Ah!
450	00:28:10	00:28:20	I know every piece of evidence regarding this case is precious, given the circumstances, so I just wanted to let you know that I've moved Ms. Chase's fingernail scrapings to the top of my extensive queue.
451	00:28:20	00:28:24	Composite substance. You're never going to believe this.
452	00:28:24	00:28:27	Egg whites, sugar, butter, milk, food coloring.
453	00:28:27	00:28:28	How did you know?
454	00:28:28	00:28:30	Butter cream frosting.
455	00:28:30	00:28:33	She had an incident with a wedding cake.
456	00:28:36	00:28:38	Are you done?
457	00:28:38	00:28:42	You know, you and me, we're not the marrying kind.
458	00:28:42	00:28:46	The intricacies of our nature can never be understood by just one woman.
459	00:28:46	00:28:49	Would you close the door, please?
460	00:28:56	00:28:58	From the other side.
461	00:29:08	00:29:11	Sara? Sara?
462	00:29:12	00:29:13	Are they here?
463	00:29:13	00:29:18	No. They're still held up with that officer-involved shooting, but the Bomb Squad has cleared the convertible.
464	00:29:18	00:29:20	Oh. Finally.
465	00:29:20	00:29:22	Something to process.
466	00:29:25	00:29:28	I thought you said the snowboards were in the suite.
467	00:29:28	00:29:30	I did.
468	00:29:30	00:29:32	Then what's the case doing in the trunk?
469	00:29:47	00:29:51	So you asked me to follow her comings and goings and her food and drink intake.
470	00:29:51	00:29:55	As far as I can tell, she didn't touch her soup or salad.
471	00:29:55	00:29:57	And the main course?
472	00:30:04	00:30:06	And what did Diane have to drink?
473	00:30:06	00:30:12	Um... I only saw her with two glasses, 00.
474	00:30:15	00:30:19	This is 15 minutes later.
475	00:30:19	00:30:20	Oh, my.
476	00:30:20	00:30:25	The waiter gave her a second glass for her toast, which I watched five times.
477	00:30:26	00:30:28	And that was it.
478	00:30:28	00:30:30	When was the last time she was on camera?
479	00:30:31	00:30:36	Well, her exit was neither polite nor discreet.
480	00:30:36	00:30:43	I know I may just be a grease monkey, but I drive a tow truck, and I think I know a little something about getting hitched.
481	00:30:43	00:30:46	And these two... uh... there's more.
482	00:30:46	00:30:51	Uh... I think these guys are in it for the long haul.
483	00:30:51	00:30:53	Making friends over here.
484	00:30:53	00:30:56	No, but seriously, uh...
485	00:30:56	00:30:59	I don't mean to get all sentimental or anything, but these two are going to have a lot of sex tonight.
486	00:30:59	00:31:01	And.. what?
487	00:31:01	00:31:03	What? Are you embarrassed?
488	00:31:03	00:31:05	She's embarrassed. I'm her older brother.
489	00:31:05	00:31:06	I changed her diapers.
490	00:31:06	00:31:08	25.
491	00:31:08	00:31:10	Would you play that again?
492	00:31:13	00:31:21	I know I may just be a grease monkey, but I drive a tow truck, and I think I know a little something about getting hitched.
493	00:31:25	00:31:29	Yeah, Jim. Check into a Mikey Shoemaker, the bride's brother.
494	00:31:29	00:31:31	Run his wants and warrants.
495	00:31:31	00:31:33	And also look into the location of his tow yard.
496	00:31:33	00:31:34	Thank you.
497	00:31:43	00:31:44	So?
498	00:31:44	00:31:47	Need your hands.
499	00:31:47	00:31:49	I thought you'd never ask.
500	00:31:49	00:31:52	I need you to reprint the bumper because the tape lifts were stolen.
501	00:31:52	00:31:54	Anything to keep me awake.
502	00:32:00	00:32:04	Uh-oh! Looks like we had some bride's little helper going on.
503	00:32:04	00:32:06	Diazepam.
504	00:32:06	00:32:11	Just filled. Rx calls for six ten-milligram pills.
505	00:32:11	00:32:13	Two left.
506	00:32:13	00:32:15	40 milligrams would match mom's blood level.
507	00:32:15	00:32:23	Jill gets some pills to calm herself, decides to calm her mother-in-law instead, and make everybody happy.
508	00:32:23	00:32:26	Okay, the blood from the snowboard bag was a match to Mother Chase.
509	00:32:26	00:32:31	That could have been what they used to transport her from point A to point B.
510	00:32:31	00:32:34	Yeah, they is right, 'cause I also found two female epithelial contributions.
511	00:32:34	00:32:40	One on each handle of the bag, and then one of the same females was also a match to the DNA from the knot in the pantyhose.
512	00:32:40	00:32:45	We could compare them to the buccal swabs we collected... if we still had them.
513	00:32:45	00:32:47	Well, we'll just have to recollect them.
514	00:32:47	00:32:48	All 200 of them?
515	00:32:48	00:32:53	Yeah, and since we can't leave, someone else is gonna have to recollect them.
516	00:32:53	00:32:54	This is crap!
517	00:32:54	00:32:56	I've been waiting on I.A.B. for...( snaps gloves )
518	00:32:56	00:32:57	...14 hours.
519	00:32:57	00:32:59	I'm tired...
520	00:32:59	00:33:03	and I kind of smell, and I don't have a freakin' car.
521	00:33:08	00:33:09	Hey, buddy.
522	00:33:09	00:33:11	Hey.
523	00:33:11	00:33:12	How you doing?
524	00:33:12	00:33:13	You all right?
525	00:33:13	00:33:14	Hey, this, this sucks, man.
526	00:33:15	00:33:18	I didn't do anything wrong, and everybody's looking at me like I'm the bad guy.
527	00:33:18	00:33:20	If I had to do it all over again, I'd do the exact same thing.
528	00:33:20	00:33:21	Nick, Nick...
529	00:33:21	00:33:23	I mean, how do I fix the situation?
530	00:33:23	00:33:24	Nick!
531	00:33:24	00:33:26	It was already screwed up to begin with. What?
532	00:33:35	00:33:37	I loaned one of the bridesmaids my jacket.
533	00:33:37	00:33:40	She was wearing black.
534	00:33:40	00:33:42	There was no reason to ALS.
535	00:33:42	00:33:49	Blood must have transferred from her to my jacket, to me.
536	00:33:49	00:33:51	I didn't want to contaminate it by pulling it over my head, you know?
537	00:33:51	00:33:53	That was good thinking.
538	00:33:59	00:34:01	All right. Hey, Wendy, Uh-huh?
539	00:34:01	00:34:10	I don't know if you'll be able to get anything off of this, but I want you to compare the female epithelials you found on the snowboard bag against the napkin that I have in my right front pocket.
540	00:34:12	00:34:14	Come on.
541	00:34:25	00:34:28	So that was a good call on the bride's brother, Mikey Shoemaker.
542	00:34:28	00:34:30	He had a prior conviction for car theft.
543	00:34:30	00:34:32	Where did you find Nick's truck?
544	00:34:32	00:34:37	In one of the paint bays of his auto body shop, right next to a delivery truck.
545	00:34:37	00:34:38	We're looking for Mikey now.
546	00:34:38	00:34:40	Well, I watched the rest of the wedding video.
547	00:34:40	00:34:46	He may have stolen the car, but once Diane disappears, Mikey never leaves the party.
548	00:34:46	00:34:47	Maybe he wasn't acting alone.
549	00:34:47	00:34:50	Hey, Pip. How you like your new ride?
550	00:34:53	00:34:55	Hey, look. They fixed it.
551	00:34:56	00:34:58	Oh. Oh, that's not funny.
552	00:34:58	00:34:59	Oh, it's a little funny.
553	00:35:16	00:35:18	Where did you get that?
554	00:35:18	00:35:21	Unis found it in a Dumpster behind Mikey Shoemaker's body shop.
555	00:35:21	00:35:24	He went through all that trouble to steal the car and that's where he ditches it?
556	00:35:24	00:35:31	Well, they didn't find any biological evidence, and he probably hocked the cameras, but at least I've been reunited with Love's deadly arrow.
557	00:35:31	00:35:35	You know that's not going to stand up in court, right?
558	00:35:35	00:35:39	Well, Negative Nelly, I know that, and you know that, but the suspects might not.
559	00:35:40	00:35:41	We have to convince them that we know what happened.
560	00:35:41	00:35:43	Do we? We're close.
561	00:35:43	00:35:45	Can you put the U.V. filter on the camera?
562	00:35:45	00:35:46	Sure.
563	00:36:01	00:36:02	How did you...?
564	00:36:02	00:36:04	I didn't, until I processed it.
565	00:36:04	00:36:10	But I was thinking the statue punctured her in the back of the head, which means one of three things might have happened.
566	00:36:10	00:36:12	Either she was stabbed by it...
567	00:36:12	00:36:14	Well, the statue looks a little unwieldy.
568	00:36:14	00:36:17	Or she accidentally fell on it.
569	00:36:17	00:36:20	But with no one to blame, why wouldn't someone just call 911?
570	00:36:24	00:36:25	she was pushed.
571	00:36:29	00:36:32	Lucky for us someone had something on their hands.
572	00:36:32	00:36:35	Something that left good ridge detail I'll swab it for trace.
573	00:36:35	00:36:38	Prints are a match to a bridesmaid, Lacey Finn.
574	00:36:38	00:36:39	She's in the system?
575	00:36:39	00:36:42	Yeah, she was a cocktail waitress for a short time.
576	00:36:42	00:36:43	Of course she was.
577	00:36:43	00:36:47	And I pulled the prints off of this pill bottle, but I didn't find a match.
578	00:36:47	00:36:51	Which means the bride didn't do it because as a nurse, she'd also be in the system.
579	00:36:51	00:36:53	Correct. However, I did find something.
580	00:36:53	00:36:55	Look at the prescribing doctor on that label.
581	00:36:55	00:36:59	I was cross-checking with the guest list, and guess who the good doctor's wife is.
582	00:37:01	00:37:02	Mrs. Valerie Whitehall.
583	00:37:02	00:37:03	She's also a bridesmaid.
584	00:37:06	00:37:08	Well, she knew where the pills were.
585	00:37:08	00:37:13	She had access to the suite, so maybe Jill didn't poison mom, Valerie did.
586	00:37:13	00:37:15	A little bonus in the bubbly.
587	00:37:15	00:37:18	I got the results from Mama Chase's suit jacket.
588	00:37:18	00:37:19	What's the trace?
589	00:37:19	00:37:21	Hair gel.
590	00:37:24	00:37:27	Lacey said that she went to fix her hair.
591	00:37:30	00:37:31	Where's that Sara chick?
592	00:37:33	00:37:36	Oh, Romeo, I don't think that you have time for romance.
593	00:37:36	00:37:42	You're being charged with grand theft auto, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to murder.
594	00:37:42	00:37:45	Okay, I will cop to everything but the murder.
595	00:37:45	00:37:48	Well, if you didn't commit the murder, why did you steal the car?
596	00:37:48	00:37:51	Look, the lady was already dead, all right?
597	00:37:52	00:37:57	And then, then you guys show up and this bridesmaid comes up to me and starts asking me all these questions about my tow truck.
598	00:37:57	00:37:58	Which bridesmaid?
599	00:37:58	00:38:00	The hot one.
600	00:38:00	00:38:04	Next thing I know, she wants to be the Bonnie to my Clyde.
601	00:38:04	00:38:06	Asked me to steal this car and trash all the evidence.
602	00:38:06	00:38:10	So you committed grand theft auto to get laid?
603	00:38:11	00:38:14	Ever stolen a two-ton piece of machinery?
604	00:38:14	00:38:17	It is way better than sex.
605	00:38:18	00:38:20	And finding a girl that doesn't want to kick you to the curb for it?
606	00:38:20	00:38:22	I mean, come on. That is just hot.
607	00:38:23	00:38:26	Besides, I hadn't gotten a wedding gift for my sister yet.
608	00:38:26	00:38:31	So I don't have a match to one of the handles to the snowboard case, but, um, your napkin girl...
609	00:38:31	00:38:33	That Mindy Faberge?
610	00:38:33	00:38:35	She got to be a bridesmaid. Yeah.
611	00:38:36	00:38:37	She matches the other handle.
612	00:38:37	00:38:40	Well, she was in the suite with the gifts.
613	00:38:40	00:38:42	She could have touched it then.
614	00:38:44	00:38:46	You paged?
615	00:38:46	00:38:49	We think that each of the bridesmaids is responsible for killing her.
616	00:38:49	00:38:53	Not individually, but working in cahoots.
617	00:38:53	00:38:56	Each one played their part.
618	00:38:56	00:39:02	Did you know the original role of the bridesmaid was to act as a human shield against the bride's enemies?
619	00:39:02	00:39:09	Women would dress similar to the bride in an effort to confuse and outsmart evil spirits that might try to overtake her on her wedding day.
620	00:39:10	00:39:14	Wow, for somebody who's anti-wedding, you certainly know a lot about it.
621	00:39:14	00:39:15	I'm not anti-wedding.
622	00:39:15	00:39:20	I'm just anti-stupid-- you know, people who do things for the sake of tradition with no clue as to why.
623	00:39:20	00:39:25	Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?
624	00:39:27	00:39:30	Valerie kindly gets mom a drink.
625	00:39:38	00:39:42	Then during her toast, Diane starts to feel the effects.
626	00:39:44	00:39:49	By Mikey's toast, she decides that she's toast.
627	00:39:49	00:39:51	...a little something about getting hitched.
628	00:39:51	00:39:55	I know what you did.
629	00:39:55	00:40:03	I'm going to have your husband's medical license, and I'm going to have you put away for attempted murder.
630	00:40:03	00:40:11	Lacey overhears Diane's paranoid yet correct ramblings and eventually follows her out.
631	00:40:16	00:40:18	You okay?
632	00:40:18	00:40:19	The gall of you to ask me that!
633	00:40:19	00:40:21	You know I'm not okay, you little tart.
634	00:40:21	00:40:23	You're all just as bad as she is.
635	00:40:23	00:40:24	Don't get mad.
636	00:40:24	00:40:26	Valerie was just trying to make you feel better.
637	00:40:26	00:40:30	Oh, by giving me a controlled substance?
638	00:40:30	00:40:35	You are going down for conspiracy!
639	00:40:35	00:40:36	All right!
640	00:40:36	00:40:37	You know what, lady?!
641	00:40:37	00:40:40	That's enough!
642	00:40:40	00:40:44	Leaving her incapacitated but not dead.
643	00:40:47	00:40:52	At which point Lacey tells Mindy and Cindy.
644	00:40:52	00:40:54	They formulate a plan.
645	00:40:56	00:40:58	Oh, God! Once we get her in there, what are we going to do with her?
646	00:40:59	00:41:02	Oh, um, let's make it look like it was, um, Forelli...
647	00:41:02	00:41:04	Fratelli brothers?
648	00:41:04	00:41:05	Fratelli brothers.
649	00:41:05	00:41:08	We'll just make it look like they did it.
650	00:41:08	00:41:09	Oh, my God.
651	00:41:15	00:41:20	They tie her to the car, chuck the bag in the trunk, return to the party.
652	00:41:27	00:41:28	Got it, yes!
653	00:41:29	00:41:35	And everyone just continues along with the joyous festivities until...
654	00:41:42	00:41:48	I'm not a bad person, and we didn't exactly kill her.
655	00:41:48	00:41:53	I mean, I like to think she killed herself because she was crazy.
656	00:41:53	00:41:56	She did crazy things to our friend.
657	00:41:56	00:41:59	I mean, who hates a pediatric nurse?
658	00:41:59	00:42:04	Granted, we'd all been drinking, but she drove us to it.
659	00:42:05	00:42:07	We did what we had to do.
660	00:42:07	00:42:10	Sisterhood is powerful this and powerful that.
661	00:42:10	00:42:12	She was on a total trip.
662	00:42:12	00:42:15	There was no way Jill could endure a life of that.
663	00:42:16	00:42:22	I just... I wanted to shut her up with the drugs, but that backfired...
664	00:42:22	00:42:23	leaving us...
665	00:42:23	00:42:24	...no choice.
666	00:42:24	00:42:25	She was coming at me.
667	00:42:25	00:42:28	I just, I just defended myself.
668	00:42:28	00:42:33	I didn't mean to take her down, but once she was, I...
669	00:42:33	00:42:35	I felt nothing.
670	00:42:35	00:42:41	There she was just, just staring at me, and all I could think was...
671	00:42:41	00:42:44	Thank God.
672	00:42:55	00:42:57	Grissom?
673	00:42:59	00:43:01	I.A.B. is here.
674	00:43:02	00:43:04	Lovely.
675	00:43:04	00:43:08	You should know that while waiting for I.A.B., we recovered the car and solved the case.
676	00:43:08	00:43:12	Well, this is not a No harm, no foul situation.
677	00:43:13	00:43:15	Disciplinary action may still be taken.
678	00:43:15	00:43:18	Okay.
679	00:43:20	00:43:22	So who wants to go first?
680	00:43:25	00:43:26	I don't think it matters.
681	00:43:26	00:43:29	I'm sure our stories are all the same.
