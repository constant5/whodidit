1,00:00:08,00:00:10,(thunder rumbling)
2,00:00:10,00:00:15,(loud music playing)
3,00:00:15,00:00:19,(yelling and laughing)
4,00:00:19,00:00:23,"Hey, bro, I'm driving drunk, and you're lighting up a J?"
5,00:00:23,00:00:26,"Maybe we should wait for those... hell, dude."
6,00:00:26,00:00:29,"Man, we're in Vegas."
7,00:00:29,00:00:30,Sweet potato Vegas!
8,00:00:30,00:00:32,Whoo!
9,00:00:32,00:00:36,(loud music continuing)
10,00:00:38,00:00:44,(all talking at once)
11,00:00:45,00:00:49,(yelling)
12,00:00:49,00:00:51,(sirens blaring)
13,00:00:54,00:00:57,Hide that! Hide it! Hide it!
14,00:00:57,00:00:59,Get it out of here!
15,00:00:59,00:01:03,(sirens blaring)
16,00:01:03,00:01:07,"Hey, hide that liquor! Hide the liquor! Hide it!"
17,00:01:07,00:01:09,Throw that joint out!
18,00:01:11,00:01:13,Get him! Get him!
19,00:01:13,00:01:15,Shoot him! Shoot him!

23,00:02:24,00:02:26,(sirens blaring)
24,00:02:26,00:02:27,Get out of the way!
25,00:02:50,00:02:53,(phone ringing)
26,00:02:56,00:02:58,Hello?
27,00:02:59,00:03:00,Hello?
28,00:03:02,00:03:06,Unknown caller. No call list.
29,00:03:06,00:03:09,Probably disposable.
30,00:03:23,00:03:25,Where's Warrick?
31,00:03:25,00:03:27,We've been calling him. There's no answer.
32,00:03:27,00:03:32,BRASS: See what happens when you get in a high-speed chase with a garbage truck and end up withtwodead bodies.
33,00:03:32,00:03:34,Where's the other one?
34,00:03:37,00:03:39,I take it he came out of the truck?
35,00:03:39,00:03:40,Heflewout.
36,00:03:40,00:03:42,At least that's what every eyewitness tells us.
37,00:03:42,00:03:45,"WILLOWS: Well, city landfill is a couple of miles down the road."
38,00:03:45,00:03:47,"What's the TOD, David?"
39,00:03:47,00:03:48,"Nine, maybe ten, hours."
40,00:03:48,00:03:49,I got no ID on either of the bodies.
41,00:03:49,00:03:51,No ID on the truck.
42,00:03:51,00:03:52,I ran the VIN number and the plates.
43,00:03:52,00:03:54,They're not in the system.
44,00:03:54,00:03:55,Good luck.
45,00:03:56,00:03:59,Control Sanitation is the only waste company in Vegas.
46,00:03:59,00:04:02,"If the garbageman works for them, his prints would be in the system."
47,00:04:02,00:04:04,"All right. Catherine, you and I got the bodies."
48,00:04:04,00:04:08,"Greg, since Warrick's MIA, you have a choice: the truck or the trail."
49,00:04:08,00:04:10,I'll go for the fresh air.
50,00:04:10,00:04:12,"Do I get a choice, too?"
51,00:04:12,00:04:15,"Because, if you don't mind, I'm going to take the garbageman."
52,00:04:15,00:04:16,Be my guest.
53,00:04:19,00:04:21,I thought I told you not to call me on this line.
54,00:04:21,00:04:25,Maybe that's because I don't want to talk to you.
55,00:04:25,00:04:27,Are you kidding me?
56,00:04:27,00:04:31,Why don't you ask the father of your unborn child?
57,00:04:31,00:04:33,No. That's stupid. Don't call the lawyers.
58,00:04:33,00:04:36,"Tina, don't call... Tina! Tina!"
59,00:04:36,00:04:39,Don't call... Tina!
60,00:04:39,00:04:40,Damn it.
61,00:04:48,00:04:51,"Hey, Gris, I'm sorry I'm late."
62,00:04:51,00:04:52,I had some business to take care of.
63,00:04:52,00:04:54,Thisisyour business.
64,00:04:54,00:04:55,You were first up.
65,00:04:55,00:04:57,That means you're supposed to be here first.
66,00:04:57,00:04:59,You get to process the trash truck.
67,00:04:59,00:05:01,No problem.
68,00:05:01,00:05:03,But get it off the street.
69,00:05:03,00:05:05,Tow it to the impound yard.
70,00:05:15,00:05:19,and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
71,00:05:54,00:05:56,These coveralls are brand-new.
72,00:05:59,00:06:01,Your garbageman was in excellent shape.
73,00:06:01,00:06:03,COD is as expected.
74,00:06:03,00:06:07,Massive BFT due to his unfortunate collision with the T-bird.
75,00:06:07,00:06:09,And your other vic was in his late 20s.
76,00:06:09,00:06:12,He was definitely crushed by something.
77,00:06:12,00:06:14,"Most likely, the garbage compactor."
78,00:06:14,00:06:16,Which happened postmortem.
79,00:06:16,00:06:19,"Oh, it's always better to be compacted dead rather than alive."
80,00:06:26,00:06:28,WILLOWS: What's his COD?
81,00:06:28,00:06:31,Suffocation. He had petechial hemorrhaging.
82,00:06:31,00:06:34,I found white fibers in the nose and mouth.
83,00:06:34,00:06:35,Sent them over to Hodges.
84,00:06:35,00:06:37,"He called back, confirmed they were silk."
85,00:06:37,00:06:39,I tried to trace garbageman's cell phone.
86,00:06:39,00:06:41,"Like we expected, it's disposable."
87,00:06:41,00:06:42,So I tracked down the distributor.
88,00:06:42,00:06:45,It was paid for in cash under a bogus name.
89,00:06:45,00:06:48,But I did get an AFIS hit off his print.
90,00:06:48,00:06:50,Brody Biggs. Former cop.
91,00:06:50,00:06:52,GRISSOM: When was this taken?
92,00:06:52,00:06:54,"1975, police academy graduation."
93,00:06:54,00:07:00,I contacted LVPD. They said he quit the force back in 1980 with a perfect record.
94,00:07:00,00:07:01,Then what?
95,00:07:01,00:07:03,Social came back to several different garages around town.
96,00:07:04,00:07:05,He was a freelance mechanic for 20 years.
97,00:07:05,00:07:08,"All right, we got to get his personnel file."
98,00:07:08,00:07:09,What about the other vic?
99,00:07:09,00:07:11,(typing) It's Jason Crewes.
100,00:07:11,00:07:13,27. Got a hit off his work card.
101,00:07:13,00:07:17,He's worked at five different casinos over the last six years.
102,00:07:22,00:07:26,"Well, it doesn't look like Jason planned on going anywhere."
103,00:07:26,00:07:29,I know a lot of people in this phone.
104,00:07:29,00:07:32,You do not.
105,00:07:32,00:07:34,Knows some famous people.
106,00:07:34,00:07:39,Or uses famous nicknames for his friends.
107,00:08:24,00:08:26,(bird tweets)
108,00:08:36,00:08:39,Did you see anything?
109,00:08:39,00:08:41,(squawks)
110,00:09:38,00:09:40,Nick!
111,00:09:43,00:09:45,I think I just found ground zero.
112,00:09:45,00:09:47,I think Jason was killed here.
113,00:09:48,00:09:52,(groans softly)
114,00:10:00,00:10:03,(muffled cries)
115,00:10:03,00:10:09,"STOKES: Well, this would have been the perfect murder if Jason's body would have actually made it to the landfill."
116,00:10:09,00:10:10,Would have been incinerated.
117,00:10:10,00:10:13,At least now his mother has someone to bury.
118,00:10:13,00:10:16,WOMAN: He was alone last night.
119,00:10:17,00:10:19,We talked at about 3:00 in the morning.
120,00:10:19,00:10:25,"He said he got off work early and was going to bed, and he'd call me when he woke up."
121,00:10:25,00:10:29,But he never did.
122,00:10:29,00:10:31,BRASS: Have you ever seen this man?
123,00:10:31,00:10:34,His name is Brody Biggs. He's a mechanic.
124,00:10:35,00:10:37,Are you sure?
125,00:10:37,00:10:39,We think this is the man that killed your son.
126,00:10:39,00:10:44,"If he's a mechanic, maybe he worked on some of Jason's limos."
127,00:10:44,00:10:46,I thought Jason was a club owner.
128,00:10:46,00:10:49,"He was a limo driver before that, long time ago."
129,00:10:49,00:10:52,"Well, couldn't be that long ago."
130,00:10:52,00:10:55,Jason was only 27.
131,00:10:55,00:10:59,You have to be 25 to be a limo driver.
132,00:10:59,00:11:01,He had all kinds of fake IDs.
133,00:11:01,00:11:04,Drove his first long one at 18.
134,00:11:04,00:11:08,The owner of the limo company liked Jason.
135,00:11:08,00:11:10,Made him a VIP driver.
136,00:11:10,00:11:13,Celebs liked Jason.
137,00:11:13,00:11:18,He could take his clients to a Motel 6 and it'd be the hottest spot in town.
138,00:11:18,00:11:26,"Wasn't long before the club owners invested in Jason, made him a group partner, gave him his own spot."
139,00:11:26,00:11:29,"Then two, then five."
140,00:11:29,00:11:32,"Suddenly, he's running the whole club scene."
141,00:11:35,00:11:40,I guess I should say heranthe club scene.
142,00:11:40,00:11:44,He's not going to be running anything anymore.
143,00:11:50,00:11:53,BROWN: I'll be damned.
144,00:11:56,00:11:59,Look at that.
145,00:11:59,00:12:00,GRISSOM: The good old days.
146,00:12:00,00:12:01,BROWN: Yeah.
147,00:12:01,00:12:05,Here's an ad for the Silver Slipper Casino-- buffet.
148,00:12:05,00:12:09,"Back when they had real eggs, not powdered ones."
149,00:12:09,00:12:12,"Hey, Gris, listen. About me being late..."
150,00:12:12,00:12:14,You have a cell phone paid for by the department.
151,00:12:14,00:12:16,"You call, you say you're running late."
152,00:12:17,00:12:19,What's going on with you?
153,00:12:19,00:12:21,"I don't know. This, uh..."
154,00:12:21,00:12:23,This whole divorce has taken the wind out of my sails.
155,00:12:23,00:12:30,"You know, I used to have the team to distract me from all this, but even that's changed with Sara being gone."
156,00:12:30,00:12:32,I feel kind of disconnected.
157,00:12:32,00:12:34,You've got your work.
158,00:12:34,00:12:36,Don't screw that up.
159,00:12:53,00:12:56,"Van Halen,1984."
160,00:12:59,00:13:05,Either this truck was delivering merchandise for a memorabilia store or it's just plain old.
161,00:13:05,00:13:07,Maybe that's why Brass couldn't find the registration record.
162,00:13:10,00:13:14,These old blue license plates were issued in the '80s.
163,00:13:14,00:13:17,I don't think this truck's been on the streets since.
164,00:13:49,00:13:51,I think this guy was disguising his truck.
165,00:13:51,00:13:55,It was orange before it was green.
166,00:13:55,00:13:57,They used to use orange garbage trucks in the '80s.
167,00:13:57,00:14:00,The hydraulic cylinder blew.
168,00:14:00,00:14:02,GRISSOM: Maybe when he crushed the body.
169,00:14:05,00:14:08,That's why all the garbage flew out.
170,00:14:08,00:14:11,Found this .22 in the parking lot near the crash.
171,00:14:11,00:14:13,Check these bullets.
172,00:14:13,00:14:15,Shorts.
173,00:14:15,00:14:19,"Usually used for shooting small animals, but in some cases they're used on people in place of a silencer."
174,00:14:19,00:14:20,"GRISSOM: Less gunpowder, less noise."
175,00:14:20,00:14:24,"BROWN: Look, if the garbageman had this gun, why didn't he just shoot the vic?"
176,00:14:24,00:14:25,GRISSOM: He found Jason sleeping.
177,00:14:25,00:14:27,Why make a mess if you don't have to?
178,00:14:27,00:14:28,Sounds like a professional hit man.
179,00:14:28,00:14:33,"GRISSOM: Well, if he was, we still have to find the guy who hired him."
180,00:14:37,00:14:41,"BROWN: I traced the VIN on the garbage truck back to The Regency, the company that made it."
181,00:14:41,00:14:45,The only model of that truck sold in Nevada was to a company called The Regal Sanitation Group.
182,00:14:45,00:14:47,They shut down in '83.
183,00:14:47,00:14:49,GRISSOM: That explains the garbage.
184,00:14:49,00:14:53,SANDERS: Regal Sanitation was owned by Anthony Pezzulo.
185,00:14:53,00:14:55,I'm studying mob history for my book.
186,00:14:55,00:14:59,Pezzulo? Wasn't he the mob boss who owned the Starfly?
187,00:15:00,00:15:06,"SANDERS: They called Pezzulo ""Whacko,"" not so much for his wacky personality as for his love for whacking guys."
188,00:15:06,00:15:11,GRISSOM: Until he himself got whacked at the Wisconsin Dells in 1983.
189,00:15:11,00:15:16,Every mob-owned business in Vegas shut down when Pezzulo died.
190,00:15:16,00:15:17,These scumbags lay roaches.
191,00:15:17,00:15:19,"Just when you think they're gone, they pop back up again."
192,00:15:19,00:15:23,Somebody put a hit out on Jason.
193,00:15:23,00:15:25,It couldn't have been Pezzulo 'cause he's been dead for 20 years.
194,00:15:25,00:15:29,Pezzulo's wife Kate got rid of Regal Sanitation right after he died.
195,00:15:29,00:15:30,She still around?
196,00:15:30,00:15:32,She fell off the radar.
197,00:15:32,00:15:34,All I could find was this old photo.
198,00:15:35,00:15:37,WOMAN: I told you the truth.
199,00:15:37,00:15:39,You lied about your name.
200,00:15:39,00:15:42,The feds told me to forget I ever had the Pezzulo name.
201,00:15:42,00:15:45,I wasn't about to remember it for you.
202,00:15:45,00:15:49,My husband had more cops than capos on his payroll.
203,00:15:49,00:15:51,So you went into witness protection.
204,00:15:51,00:15:53,You changed your identity.
205,00:15:53,00:15:54,And then you stayed in Vegas?
206,00:15:54,00:15:57,Feds felt we'd actually be safer here.
207,00:15:57,00:16:03,"They thought if we left, we might suffer the same consequences as Anthony."
208,00:16:03,00:16:06,BRASS: Did Jason have any mob ties?
209,00:16:06,00:16:11,Jason was three years old when Anthony died.
210,00:16:11,00:16:13,He never even knew his father.
211,00:16:13,00:16:19,The last time we talked you said you didn't know Jason's killer.
212,00:16:19,00:16:21,What about this guy?
213,00:16:26,00:16:28,That's B.B.
214,00:16:28,00:16:29,That's the same guy.
215,00:16:30,00:16:33,B.B. is short for Brody Biggs.
216,00:16:33,00:16:36,B.B. didn't kill Jason.
217,00:16:36,00:16:38,There's no way.
218,00:16:38,00:16:40,He was Anthony's friend.
219,00:16:40,00:16:44,Friend?
220,00:16:44,00:16:48,B.B. was driving one of your husband's old garbage trucks.
221,00:16:48,00:16:52,Your dead son was in the back with the rest of the garbage.
222,00:16:52,00:16:54,How did B.B. get the truck?
223,00:17:00,00:17:03,I haven't seen B.B. in 23 years.
224,00:17:03,00:17:05,You got rid of the business.
225,00:17:05,00:17:08,What happened to the trucks?
226,00:17:08,00:17:10,I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda.
227,00:17:10,00:17:14,The owner of Pigalle Boulevard Strip Club.
228,00:17:14,00:17:16,So did Gedda and B.B. know each other?
229,00:17:16,00:17:22,"Of course, they were both on Anthony's crew, but they would never..."
230,00:17:22,00:17:23,Never what?
231,00:17:23,00:17:28,Never kill your son and dispose of him in one of the trucks you gave him?
232,00:17:33,00:17:37,When was the last time you saw Gedda?
233,00:17:37,00:17:38,(sniffles)
234,00:17:38,00:17:43,I haven't had any contact with him since Anthony died.
235,00:17:43,00:17:47,So you're telling me you haven't seen or spoken to Lou Gedda in 23 years?
236,00:17:50,00:17:53,Gedda and I had an agreement.
237,00:17:53,00:17:58,He was to keep away from our family.
238,00:17:58,00:18:02,Forget Jason and I ever existed.
239,00:18:04,00:18:07,"Obviously, Lou Gedda is not a man of his word."
240,00:18:23,00:18:25,This place has always been bad news.
241,00:18:25,00:18:27,My guys are in here at least twice a week.
242,00:18:28,00:18:29,Yet there's always a line.
243,00:18:29,00:18:31,Never underestimate the power of the ass.
244,00:18:31,00:18:32,Look out. Coming through.
245,00:18:32,00:18:35,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
246,00:18:35,00:18:39,(rhythm and blues playing)
247,00:19:12,00:19:14,Looking for Lou Gedda.
248,00:19:36,00:19:38,"MAN: Yeah, come on in."
249,00:19:41,00:19:45,Who let you two up here?
250,00:19:45,00:19:46,Just so I know who to fire.
251,00:19:46,00:19:49,Gold card.
252,00:19:50,00:19:54,"Oh, yeah, those seem to work everywhere."
253,00:19:54,00:19:56,Got to get me one.
254,00:19:56,00:19:57,Ahh...!
255,00:20:00,00:20:02,I know why you're here.
256,00:20:02,00:20:04,And I don't know what to say.
257,00:20:04,00:20:06,I can't control these girls.
258,00:20:06,00:20:10,"They want to leave with customers and do whatever it is they do, I can't prevent that."
259,00:20:10,00:20:13,"Believe me, I don't like whores."
260,00:20:13,00:20:15,I like dancers.
261,00:20:15,00:20:18,"When I find out they're whores, I kick them curbside."
262,00:20:18,00:20:19,We're not here about your girls.
263,00:20:19,00:20:21,We're here about this guy.
264,00:20:21,00:20:23,B.B.
265,00:20:23,00:20:26,"Yeah, works at my auto detailing."
266,00:20:26,00:20:31,"But I tell ya, he's in here more, getting drunk and checking out the breast-est-es."
267,00:20:31,00:20:33,"Well, you don't have to worry about him anymore. He's dead."
268,00:20:33,00:20:36,Oh. Well...
269,00:20:36,00:20:40,"unless you invite me to the funeral, what's this got to do with me?"
270,00:20:40,00:20:41,Tell me about Jason Crewes.
271,00:20:41,00:20:45,"He brings me boatloads of celebrities, which equals boatloads of money."
272,00:20:45,00:20:47,I love the kid.
273,00:20:47,00:20:50,"Oh, don't tell me."
274,00:20:50,00:20:51,You think Jason killed B.B.?
275,00:20:51,00:20:54,We think B.B. killed Jason.
276,00:20:54,00:20:58,"Now, see, that makes more sense."
277,00:20:58,00:21:00,"When is the last time you saw Jason Crewes, sir?"
278,00:21:00,00:21:01,Last week.
279,00:21:01,00:21:03,How long have you known him?
280,00:21:03,00:21:04,A couple years at most.
281,00:21:05,00:21:07,I still don't understand what this has to do with me.
282,00:21:07,00:21:09,You missing a garbage truck?
283,00:21:09,00:21:10,Go again?
284,00:21:10,00:21:12,Regal Sanitation Group.
285,00:21:12,00:21:13,Your buddy Pezzulo's old company.
286,00:21:14,00:21:15,You inherited the trucks.
287,00:21:15,00:21:17,So what?
288,00:21:17,00:21:20,Jason Crewes' corpse flew out of one of your trucks earlier this morning.
289,00:21:20,00:21:22,Do you know how much this club made last year?
290,00:21:22,00:21:23,30 mill.
291,00:21:23,00:21:25,You think I'm still messing around with trash?
292,00:21:25,00:21:27,And that's the end of this.
293,00:21:27,00:21:33,"You want to continue asking me questions, you're going to have to do it with my dream team present."
294,00:22:10,00:22:11,BROWN: Here you go.
295,00:22:11,00:22:13,Thank you.
296,00:22:13,00:22:16,"So you're the talented Mr. Raykirk, agent to the stars."
297,00:22:16,00:22:16,"Uh-uh, manager."
298,00:22:16,00:22:18,What's the difference?
299,00:22:18,00:22:22,"Uh, well, an agent gets ten percent and a manager gets 15."
300,00:22:22,00:22:29,"Listen, I'm here in town for a film festival and I have to get to a screening, so you can you just, you know, cut to the chase?"
301,00:22:31,00:22:33,Jason Crewes is dead.
302,00:22:35,00:22:37,Okay.
303,00:22:40,00:22:45,Um... So he took you to Pigalle Boulevard in August.
304,00:22:45,00:22:46,Do you remember that?
305,00:22:46,00:22:48,How do you know about that?
306,00:22:48,00:22:49,I'm an investigator.
307,00:22:49,00:22:52,"Some things I do know, but there's a lot that I don't."
308,00:22:52,00:22:54,Somebody put a hit out on your friend.
309,00:22:54,00:22:55,You want to help us out here?
310,00:22:55,00:23:03,"I have an agent friend who I work with who had a bachelor party out here, and Jason hooked us up VIP-style."
311,00:23:06,00:23:12,"He took us to Moon and LAX and Drai's and then of course, naturally, we ended up at a strip club."
312,00:23:12,00:23:16,And everyone knows the best girls are at Pigalle Boulevard.
313,00:23:19,00:23:24,It couldn't get any better until the check showed up.
314,00:23:24,00:23:25,Ten grand?
315,00:23:25,00:23:26,The manager said $800 a bottle.
316,00:23:26,00:23:28,We ordered five.
317,00:23:29,00:23:31,I hear you don't want to pay what you owe us.
318,00:23:31,00:23:33,"No. No, no, no, no."
319,00:23:33,00:23:35,"I just think you overcharged us, man."
320,00:23:35,00:23:36,No.
321,00:23:39,00:23:40,This place is a rip-off.
322,00:23:40,00:23:41,And your girls?
323,00:23:41,00:23:45,"They're beat, overrated, and oversized."
324,00:23:45,00:23:46,Get it?
325,00:23:46,00:23:48,I'm not paying.
326,00:23:48,00:23:50,Let's take a walk.
327,00:24:01,00:24:05,I'm gonna give you a minute so you can figure out what you want to do.
328,00:24:05,00:24:08,I'm cutting something.
329,00:24:08,00:24:10,But I'm gonna give you the choice of what it's gonna be.
330,00:24:10,00:24:11,"No. Oh, yeah, yeah."
331,00:24:11,00:24:14,I can slice you here or I can slice you here.
332,00:24:14,00:24:16,"(sobbing) Come on, no, no, no."
333,00:24:16,00:24:17,"Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh."
334,00:24:18,00:24:19,"Come on, you choose."
335,00:24:19,00:24:21,"I mean, I was never more scared in my life."
336,00:24:21,00:24:26,"You know, he was so sweet enough to give me the choice of my throat or my genitals, so I chose the latter..."
337,00:24:26,00:24:28,so I'd live.
338,00:24:28,00:24:31,Then he charged my card and escorted us out to the parking lot.
339,00:24:31,00:24:33,"Oh, here's something really cool."
340,00:24:33,00:24:38,"I left with a broken nose, some sore wrists, and some really nice bruises underneath my arms."
341,00:24:39,00:24:42,And I just should've given him the ten grand because I paid my plastic surgeon twice that.
342,00:24:42,00:24:44,And you told Jason about all this?
343,00:24:44,00:24:46,"Oh, yeah."
344,00:24:46,00:24:49,"I mean, he gave this guy Gedda a call right in front of me."
345,00:24:49,00:24:54,Then he cursed him out and he told him he would never take anyone to Pigalle anymore.
346,00:24:54,00:24:58,"Listen, I'm really sorry about all this."
347,00:24:58,00:25:01,"But, um, thanks a lot for your time. Oh, yeah."
348,00:25:01,00:25:05,"By the way, if you're gonna prosecute this guy, I'm not a witness."
349,00:25:05,00:25:09,"There's a reason that I didn't press charges, if you know what I mean."
350,00:25:30,00:25:31,Four shots.
351,00:25:54,00:25:57,"(computer blips, bleeps)"
352,00:26:01,00:26:03,(beeping)
353,00:26:05,00:26:06,Got an IBIS hit off that gun.
354,00:26:06,00:26:07,Unsolved murder in '93.
355,00:26:08,00:26:09,Victim was found in the desert.
356,00:26:09,00:26:12,"His car was found at Pigalle Boulevard, the last place anyone saw him."
357,00:26:12,00:26:14,GRISSOM: Our hit man's good for two murders.
358,00:26:14,00:26:18,"The unsolved in '93, where he actually used a gun, and Jason Crewes, who he suffocated."
359,00:26:19,00:26:20,"So, who hired him?"
360,00:26:20,00:26:22,I have a good feeling he works for Gedda.
361,00:26:22,00:26:24,"Yeah, but we don't work off feelings, do we?"
362,00:26:24,00:26:33,"According to Mr. Hollywood, Jason cost Gedda a lot of money, and he dissed him, which is more than enough for Gedda to order out a hit on someone, even if Jason is Pezzulo's son."
363,00:26:33,00:26:34,Any evidence?
364,00:26:34,00:26:38,I ran Pigalle's address to find out if there are any more crimes linked to it over the years.
365,00:26:38,00:26:41,"I found hundreds: 416s, 413s, 411s..."
366,00:26:41,00:26:43,The list goes on.
367,00:26:43,00:26:44,Any consistent suspects?
368,00:26:44,00:26:48,Only thing consistent is that the victims refused to file charges and the witnesses refused to give statements.
369,00:26:49,00:26:52,And it's funny enough the cops lost interest in pursuing it.
370,00:26:52,00:26:54,What are you saying?
371,00:26:54,00:26:59,"I'm saying it looks like Gedda is running an old school extortion racket, and you can't do that without having cops on the payroll."
372,00:27:23,00:27:25,(water spraying)
373,00:27:43,00:27:45,Hey!
374,00:27:45,00:27:47,I just want to talk!
375,00:27:47,00:27:49,"I got warrants, man!"
376,00:27:49,00:27:50,I'm not a cop.
377,00:27:50,00:27:52,I don't care. You got a piece.
378,00:27:52,00:27:54,Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
379,00:27:54,00:27:55,You live here? Pretty much.
380,00:27:55,00:27:57,What do you want?
381,00:27:57,00:27:58,You ever see anybody get beat up inside?
382,00:27:58,00:28:00,"No, no, I never seen none of that."
383,00:28:00,00:28:01,"Don't make me pull those warrants, man."
384,00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, I seen guys get beat up."
385,00:28:03,00:28:04,This is Strip Club Strip.
386,00:28:04,00:28:06,Guys get beat up and down this block.
387,00:28:06,00:28:08,You ever see the owner beat up anyone?
388,00:28:08,00:28:09,"Hey, they let me stay here."
389,00:28:09,00:28:11,They're real good to me.
390,00:28:11,00:28:13,I didn't ask you that.
391,00:28:13,00:28:17,"Lot of troublemakers, they come out of there and they get hauled off."
392,00:28:17,00:28:19,That's all I know.
393,00:28:19,00:28:21,"What do you mean by ""hauled off""?"
394,00:29:09,00:29:11,(metallic clacking)
395,00:29:25,00:29:27,You got a warrant?
396,00:29:27,00:29:28,Do I need one?
397,00:29:28,00:29:30,I own this block.
398,00:29:30,00:29:34,"Unless you're lookin' to get a detail job, you're trespassing."
399,00:29:34,00:29:35,What do you do with this?
400,00:29:35,00:29:37,I burn meat.
401,00:30:13,00:30:15,Hey. Hey.
402,00:30:15,00:30:16,What's up?
403,00:30:16,00:30:19,Trying to get this warrant for Gedda's property.
404,00:30:19,00:30:22,I'm getting close though.
405,00:30:22,00:30:25,Check out these bruise patterns.
406,00:30:25,00:30:26,"Hey, what are those?"
407,00:30:26,00:30:27,What?
408,00:30:27,00:30:28,Those pills?
409,00:30:29,00:30:31,"Oh, they're supposed to keep me alert."
410,00:30:31,00:30:32,Really? Yeah.
411,00:30:32,00:30:34,How long you been taking those?
412,00:30:34,00:30:37,"I don't know, for a couple months."
413,00:30:37,00:30:41,"Aren't you still taking those sleeping pills, too?"
414,00:30:41,00:30:43,What's it to you?
415,00:30:46,00:30:50,So now... you're taking uppers and downers.
416,00:30:50,00:30:53,"Gimme a break, man."
417,00:30:53,00:30:56,"No, you need to give yourself a break, Warrick."
418,00:30:56,00:30:58,"Hey, let it go, bro."
419,00:30:58,00:31:02,"No. No, I'm not going to let it go."
420,00:31:02,00:31:04,"(pills clattering) What are you doing, man?"
421,00:31:04,00:31:07,"You need to take a look at yourself, Warrick."
422,00:31:08,00:31:10,And I care because I'm your friend.
423,00:31:17,00:31:19,(chuckles softly)
424,00:31:20,00:31:21,(pats shoulder)
425,00:31:21,00:31:23,All right? Yeah.
426,00:31:24,00:31:25,(pats shoulder)
427,00:31:25,00:31:28,"All right, tell me about these bruises."
428,00:31:28,00:31:33,BROWN: The 415 vic claims he got beat up inside the Pigalle.
429,00:31:33,00:31:35,"Couple days later, he dropped all the charges."
430,00:31:35,00:31:38,And then there's the unsolved murder.
431,00:31:38,00:31:42,"They find a vic out in the desert, but they find his car outside of Pigalle's."
432,00:31:42,00:31:44,Same bruise pattern.
433,00:31:44,00:31:48,Now we got this Hollywood agent who mentions that he also has bruises under his arms.
434,00:31:48,00:31:53,He claims that he was strapped to a barber's chair in Gedda's office.
435,00:31:53,00:31:56,That should be enough for a warrant.
436,00:32:00,00:32:03,BRASS: The judge doesn't think the bruises are enough probable cause to issue a warrant.
437,00:32:03,00:32:05,BROWN (on phone): What judge?
438,00:32:05,00:32:06,Greene.
439,00:32:06,00:32:09,"When I was running bets for Judge Cohen, she was in on the action."
440,00:32:09,00:32:11,I have no comment.
441,00:32:11,00:32:18,"You know, these club owners-- they pay a lot of taxes; they fund campaigns; they hand out free drinks, all in exchange for protection."
442,00:32:19,00:32:20,"I mean, what can I do?"
443,00:32:20,00:32:25,"Go to the Undersheriff, see if he can use his influence."
444,00:32:25,00:32:27,But I doubt it.
445,00:32:27,00:32:30,"(line disconnects, dial tone humming)"
446,00:32:36,00:32:38,Excuse me.
447,00:32:39,00:32:42,BROWN: McKeen!
448,00:32:42,00:32:44,Excuse me a moment.
449,00:32:44,00:32:45,Judge denied me the warrant.
450,00:32:45,00:32:46,What do you want me to do?
451,00:32:47,00:32:48,Get me the warrant.
452,00:32:48,00:32:49,Lou Gedda is getting away with murder.
453,00:32:49,00:32:51,"All right, say that I get you the warrant."
454,00:32:51,00:32:54,"What are you looking for, something that made armpit bruises?"
455,00:32:54,00:32:57,The barber's chair in Gedda's office made the armpit bruises.
456,00:32:58,00:33:01,I'm agreeing with the judge.
457,00:33:01,00:33:03,McKEEN: Grissom!
458,00:33:05,00:33:08,You need to save your CSI here.
459,00:33:08,00:33:11,What he has is circumstantial based off of weird bruises and a barber chair.
460,00:33:11,00:33:16,Brown needs to get better evidence and leave the rest in our hands.
461,00:33:16,00:33:19,"I'm sorry, leave what in your hands-- Gedda's money?"
462,00:33:22,00:33:24,Listen to me.
463,00:33:24,00:33:26,Putting Gedda in jail is not gonna solve your problems.
464,00:33:26,00:33:28,You just got the rest of the night off.
465,00:33:28,00:33:32,(crickets chirping)
466,00:33:41,00:33:43,(door opening in distance)
467,00:33:52,00:33:55,(duffel bag sliding heavily)
468,00:34:06,00:34:07,Hey! (gasps)
469,00:34:07,00:34:09,What's in the bag?
470,00:34:09,00:34:10,All my stuff.
471,00:34:10,00:34:12,I'm just cleaning out my locker.
472,00:34:12,00:34:15,Show me.
473,00:34:18,00:34:19,(zipper opens)
474,00:34:21,00:34:23,(sighs)
475,00:34:23,00:34:25,"Here, let me help you with that."
476,00:34:36,00:34:37,Thanks.
477,00:34:37,00:34:39,I'm sorry.
478,00:34:44,00:34:46,(sighs)
479,00:35:05,00:35:06,What can I get you tonight?
480,00:35:06,00:35:08,Got any Dom Perignon?
481,00:35:08,00:35:09,Mm-hmm.
482,00:35:09,00:35:11,What about Cristal? We do.
483,00:35:11,00:35:12,We also have DP Rose.
484,00:35:12,00:35:14,I'll take one of each.
485,00:35:47,00:35:48,Hey... Hey!
486,00:35:48,00:35:49,I'm sorry about earlier.
487,00:35:49,00:35:52,I thought you were carrying a dead body in there or something.
488,00:35:52,00:35:54,"You're a cop, right?"
489,00:35:54,00:35:56,I'm Warrick Brown.
490,00:35:56,00:35:58,I'm Candy.
491,00:35:58,00:35:59,"Nice to meet you, Candy."
492,00:35:59,00:36:00,"So, you work here?"
493,00:36:00,00:36:04,Yeah.
494,00:36:04,00:36:05,What do you want?
495,00:36:05,00:36:08,Everything.
496,00:36:21,00:36:22,"Hey, cheers, girl."
497,00:36:22,00:36:25,"Hey, let's get out of here, you and me."
498,00:36:25,00:36:26,I'm working.
499,00:36:26,00:36:29,"Come on, I just want to ask you a few questions."
500,00:36:29,00:36:31,I don't go home with the customers.
501,00:36:33,00:36:35,Pay the bill and let's go.
502,00:36:37,00:36:39,How'd you know I was here?
503,00:36:39,00:36:41,You've been here twice already today. We're leaving.
504,00:36:41,00:36:44,"Come on, Gris, why don't you sit down and have a drink with us?"
505,00:36:44,00:36:45,I'm on the clock.
506,00:36:45,00:36:46,So am I.
507,00:36:47,00:36:48,So you want to get fired.
508,00:36:48,00:36:50,"No, I want to let them know I'm here."
509,00:36:50,00:36:53,I figured I'd order a couple bottles and not pay for it and see what happens.
510,00:36:53,00:36:55,You think he's that stupid?
511,00:36:55,00:36:57,It's worth a try.
512,00:36:57,00:36:59,"Here you go, sir."
513,00:36:59,00:37:01,Thank you.
514,00:37:05,00:37:09,"Well, now you gotta pay for it, 'cause we're not allowed to accept gifts."
515,00:37:09,00:37:11,BROWN: I left my car.
516,00:37:11,00:37:13,I gotta get my car.
517,00:37:13,00:37:18,"You gotta admit, though, once I get this done..."
518,00:37:18,00:37:21,"Get in the car, Warrick."
519,00:37:21,00:37:24,Go on.
520,00:37:24,00:37:25,Go home. Sleep it off.
521,00:37:25,00:37:27,I'll see you in my office in the morning.
522,00:37:40,00:37:44,"(people talking, laughing, music throbbing)"
523,00:38:00,00:38:02,Hey... follow that girl.
524,00:38:24,00:38:27,(jaunty jazz playing)
525,00:38:32,00:38:33,(sighs)
526,00:38:37,00:38:38,Thanks.
527,00:38:43,00:38:45,You don't give up.
528,00:38:45,00:38:46,Not tonight.
529,00:38:46,00:38:48,Irish whiskey. Neat.
530,00:38:48,00:38:50,"What's your real name, Candy?"
531,00:38:50,00:38:52,Joanna Krumsky.
532,00:38:52,00:38:55,Joanna. I'll stick with Candy.
533,00:38:55,00:38:56,(both laughing)
534,00:38:56,00:39:01,"So, now that we're out of the Pigalle, you can help me out with a few questions."
535,00:39:01,00:39:03,Good luck.
536,00:39:04,00:39:06,Anybody ever get heavy-handed with you over there?
537,00:39:06,00:39:10,Not with me. I'm a black belt.
538,00:39:10,00:39:11,Nice.
539,00:39:11,00:39:13,"Not even the owner, Gedda?"
540,00:39:13,00:39:15,Not even him.
541,00:39:17,00:39:19,Thanks.
542,00:39:23,00:39:26,So what about the customer? They ever get beat-downs?
543,00:39:26,00:39:29,When the guys get drunk and start groping the girls.
544,00:39:29,00:39:31,That's not tolerated.
545,00:39:31,00:39:34,You ever see a barber's chair in Gedda's office?
546,00:39:34,00:39:35,"No, but I heard about one."
547,00:39:36,00:39:37,It's supposed to be Al Capone's.
548,00:39:37,00:39:38,Al Capone.
549,00:39:38,00:39:40,"Yeah, but that has to be a rumor."
550,00:39:40,00:39:44,Mob guy with Al Capone's chair-- it's so clichÃ©.
551,00:39:44,00:39:47,Gedda's like the last wise guy left in Vegas.
552,00:39:47,00:39:50,Guess that's his way of keeping his culture alive.
553,00:39:50,00:39:51,Scumbags like him don't have culture.
554,00:39:51,00:39:55,Scumbags like him started Vegas.
555,00:39:55,00:39:58,None of these lights would be here if it wasn't for them.
556,00:39:58,00:40:02,What's a hot young thing like you doing working in a nasty place like that?
557,00:40:02,00:40:04,Money.
558,00:40:04,00:40:06,The hours.
559,00:40:06,00:40:08,The dancing.
560,00:40:08,00:40:12,How about you giving me that last dance of the evening?
561,00:40:21,00:40:25,JOANNA: Relax. It's just for your protection.
562,00:40:25,00:40:27,It's just for protection.
563,00:40:27,00:40:30,(distorted laughter echoing)
564,00:41:37,00:41:39,Just for your protection.
565,00:42:29,00:42:31,(currency crinkling)
566,00:42:31,00:42:33,Thanks.
567,00:42:40,00:42:43,(distorted police radio communication)
568,00:42:51,00:42:53,"No, no, no! You can't cross the tape!"
569,00:42:53,00:42:54,Not this time.
570,00:42:54,00:42:56,This is your car.
571,00:43:01,00:43:06,No! No!
572,00:43:06,00:43:07,"No, this is wrong!"
573,00:43:07,00:43:09,She didn't do anything!
