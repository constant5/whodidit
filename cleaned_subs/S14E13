2,00:00:11,00:00:15,(indistinct chatter; static crackling)
3,00:00:15,00:00:17,MAN (staticky): Can I get a cup of coffee from...
4,00:00:17,00:00:18,"(man continues, voice garbled, mixed with other voices)"
5,00:00:18,00:00:20,WOMAN: Where do you want to go tonight?
6,00:00:20,00:00:22,"(staticky): You want, to, like..."
7,00:00:22,00:00:24,"MAN: I'd like a tall latte with, uh, two shots... (static)"
8,00:00:25,00:00:26,Coming right up. Thanks.
9,00:00:28,00:00:30,"Would you like anything to eat, sir?"
10,00:00:30,00:00:32,"No, thank you."
11,00:00:32,00:00:34,"That'll be three dollars, please."
12,00:00:34,00:00:37,"Um, look, I don't suppose you could, uh, break a 50?"
13,00:00:37,00:00:39,For a three-dollar latte?
14,00:00:39,00:00:41,"Well, it's all I have."
15,00:00:41,00:00:43,All right. (clears throat)
16,00:00:43,00:00:44,Thank you; thank you so much.
17,00:00:49,00:00:52,Mr. Merchiston?
18,00:00:52,00:00:54,Keep walking.
19,00:00:55,00:00:56,Who are you?
20,00:00:56,00:00:58,A friend of Suvari.
21,00:00:58,00:00:59,Where is Suvari?
22,00:00:59,00:01:01,"Not here, but I am."
23,00:01:01,00:01:06,Right. And what assurance do I have that this man Suvari is actually real?
24,00:01:06,00:01:10,How does Suvari really know that you're a reporter?
25,00:01:10,00:01:12,And not an Agency asset?
26,00:01:12,00:01:16,"Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I've yet to be mistaken for James Bond."
27,00:01:16,00:01:18,(laughs)
28,00:01:18,00:01:19,Aw.
29,00:01:21,00:01:22,(surveillance camera whirring)
30,00:01:24,00:01:25,Suvari will be in touch.
31,00:01:45,00:01:48,(alarm chirps)
32,00:01:50,00:01:52,(engine growling)
33,00:01:55,00:01:58,"(engine roars, tires screech)"
34,00:02:03,00:02:05,(engine roars)
35,00:02:05,00:02:07,"(siren starts up, tires screech)"
36,00:02:08,00:02:10,"OFFICER (over radio): Control, this is 3-David-34."
37,00:02:10,00:02:12,Reporting a possible 425-Baker.
38,00:02:12,00:02:14,In pursuit of a silver Camaro.
39,00:02:14,00:02:16,"License Adam-King-Sam-Henry, 413."
40,00:02:16,00:02:20,Vehicle's traveling southbound on Rialto Ridge at high rate of speed.
41,00:02:20,00:02:22,(siren wailing)
42,00:02:22,00:02:24,"Backup units, be advised."
43,00:02:24,00:02:25,Suspect vehicle has turned onto Wilmington.
44,00:02:25,00:02:26,"(tires screech, siren wails)"
45,00:02:32,00:02:34,He's heading for the Strip.
46,00:02:34,00:02:37,"OFFICER: Control, this guy's not stopping."
47,00:02:37,00:02:39,We need to bring him down before he hurts somebody.
48,00:02:42,00:02:44,OFFICER: He's crossing lanes!
49,00:02:46,00:02:47,"Oh, my God!"
50,00:02:47,00:02:52,"CONTROL: All units, fire and paramedics are en route to your location."
51,00:02:53,00:02:55,Thank you.
52,00:02:55,00:02:57,Yeager?! What are you doing here?
53,00:02:57,00:02:59,"Oh, I'm pulling double shifts this week."
54,00:02:59,00:03:01,"Need the hours, so you're stuck with me."
55,00:03:01,00:03:08,"So, our driver raced through the intersection, lost control, hit this lamp pole, and spun out over there."
56,00:03:08,00:03:09,The vehicle's registered to Zenith Car Rentals.
57,00:03:09,00:03:11,Office will be open in a hour.
58,00:03:11,00:03:12,We'll get the renter's name then.
59,00:03:12,00:03:14,Think I have an I.D.
60,00:03:17,00:03:19,Passport.
61,00:03:22,00:03:24,Finn... check this out.
62,00:03:35,00:03:37,It's John Merchiston.
63,00:03:37,00:03:39,The reporter?
64,00:03:39,00:03:40,Yeah.
65,00:03:40,00:03:42,I don't understand.
66,00:03:42,00:03:44,Why would he run from the LVPD?
67,00:03:44,00:03:45,I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.
68,00:03:45,00:03:49,"Well, if this guy's a reporter, maybe there's more to the story."
69,00:04:50,00:04:52,MERCHISTON: That voice inside your head.
70,00:04:52,00:04:54,The day that it does go quiet.
71,00:04:56,00:04:58,Do you think that that that will bring you peace?
72,00:04:58,00:05:00,Or will it be a loss too great to bear?
73,00:05:04,00:05:07,Merchiston and I spent a lot of time together.
74,00:05:07,00:05:09,I suppose he got to know me a little bit.
75,00:05:09,00:05:11,"But I don't, I don't know anything about him."
76,00:05:11,00:05:13,I don't know if he had a family...
77,00:05:13,00:05:14,He doesn't have any family.
78,00:05:17,00:05:19,"Well, hell."
79,00:05:19,00:05:21,All right.
80,00:05:21,00:05:22,What do we know?
81,00:05:22,00:05:25,"On the face of it, it looks like an accident."
82,00:05:25,00:05:27,"What's that supposed to mean-- ""on the face of it""?"
83,00:05:27,00:05:28,"Well, look at the vehicle."
84,00:05:28,00:05:30,There's nothing left of it.
85,00:05:30,00:05:32,"I mean, the engine is all the way over there."
86,00:05:32,00:05:34,Have you ever seen a car accident like this?
87,00:05:34,00:05:36,"Yeah, sadly, I have."
88,00:05:36,00:05:38,"Alcohol, drugs, a lead foot."
89,00:05:38,00:05:39,I see it all the time.
90,00:05:39,00:05:42,"Yeah, well, John didn't drink and he didn't do drugs."
91,00:05:42,00:05:44,He had been sober for over two years.
92,00:05:44,00:05:47,Is there something you should be telling me?
93,00:05:47,00:05:50,John was working on a story.
94,00:05:50,00:05:54,Something to do with the government and domestic spying.
95,00:05:54,00:05:55,He told me that he was being followed.
96,00:05:55,00:05:57,"I, of course, thought that he was paranoid."
97,00:05:57,00:06:00,"Wait, wait a minute."
98,00:06:00,00:06:01,When did this happen?
99,00:06:01,00:06:02,"Well, a couple of months ago."
100,00:06:02,00:06:03,"I-I had, uh, you know..."
101,00:06:03,00:06:04,We stayed in touch.
102,00:06:04,00:06:07,You'd stayed in touch.
103,00:06:07,00:06:09,"Yes, we stayed in touch."
104,00:06:09,00:06:11,I'm listening.
105,00:06:11,00:06:20,"The extent of the damage to the car, the behavior of a man who had no reason to run from the police, and yet, was obviously running from something."
106,00:06:20,00:06:21,So you think this was murder?
107,00:06:21,00:06:23,That John was targeted?
108,00:06:23,00:06:26,I think he was being silenced for something that he knew.
109,00:06:26,00:06:28,Somebody puts a bomb in the car?
110,00:06:28,00:06:30,Detonates it during a high-speed police chase?
111,00:06:30,00:06:32,"Is that what you think? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
112,00:06:32,00:06:34,"That's way out there, Jules."
113,00:06:34,00:06:40,You don't believe that there are parts of government that would go to extreme measures to silence someone?
114,00:06:40,00:06:41,What I believe in is evidence.
115,00:06:41,00:06:46,And so should you if you're thinking about accusing somebody in authority.
116,00:06:47,00:06:53,"BRODY: Based on this video footage, I can't tell if Finn's theory is correct, and the car exploded before hitting the light pole."
117,00:06:53,00:06:55,Or if it happened on impact.
118,00:06:55,00:06:58,Here's the rest of the traffic cam footage from the chase.
119,00:06:58,00:07:03,Merchiston ran the red light at Sahara and Rialto Ridge already doing 90.
120,00:07:03,00:07:05,Let's see where This chase began.
121,00:07:05,00:07:07,(beeping)
122,00:07:09,00:07:11,Garage at the Embarcadero?
123,00:07:11,00:07:13,"Man, he came flying out of there. Hmm."
124,00:07:13,00:07:18,And that is the best angle from the street of the Embarcadero we have.
125,00:07:18,00:07:20,We might be able to track him moving through the mall.
126,00:07:20,00:07:22,Let's see.
127,00:07:22,00:07:25,Hello.
128,00:07:25,00:07:26,Who's the mystery woman?
129,00:07:26,00:07:27,I don't know.
130,00:07:27,00:07:29,But it looks like she handed him something.
131,00:07:29,00:07:31,"And the way the light's hitting it, it looks metallic."
132,00:07:31,00:07:33,Maybe a key?
133,00:07:33,00:07:34,Merchiston was a journalist.
134,00:07:34,00:07:37,I'm thinking that that was a flash drive.
135,00:07:37,00:07:39,We didn't find a flash drive at the scene.
136,00:07:39,00:07:41,Though I doubt it would have survived that explosion.
137,00:07:41,00:07:46,"BRODY: You know, she was the last person to see Merchiston alive. We need to find her."
138,00:07:46,00:07:51,"WOMAN: So, Mr. Merchiston, you go from rock journalist to quixotic muckraker."
139,00:07:51,00:07:54,I'd have to say I'm just a seeker of the truth.
140,00:07:54,00:07:58,"And if that makes certain people uncomfortable, then maybe they need to be uncomfortable."
141,00:07:58,00:08:05,"'Cause I would say that in our obsession with security, we may be relinquishing our freedom."
142,00:08:05,00:08:08,Surrendering to the real enemy-- fear.
143,00:08:08,00:08:11,Finished my autopsy on Mr. Merchiston.
144,00:08:11,00:08:23,"""C.O.D.: massive blunt force trauma consistent with high speed impact."" If it's any consolation, death would've been mercifully quick-- long before the fire consumed the vehicle."
145,00:08:23,00:08:28,"Tox report shows high levels of cocaine, and a blood alcohol level of .19."
146,00:08:28,00:08:31,"And in that condition, I'm not surprised he didn't want to get pulled over."
147,00:08:31,00:08:34,It says here you're going to rule it an accident.
148,00:08:34,00:08:37,He should never have been behind the wheel.
149,00:08:45,00:08:47,(lift whirring)
150,00:09:01,00:09:02,(whirring)
151,00:09:03,00:09:04,(camera shutter clicking)
152,00:09:08,00:09:10,FINLAY: I got your text.
153,00:09:10,00:09:11,You find something?
154,00:09:11,00:09:13,"Yeah, something I've never seen before."
155,00:09:13,00:09:16,"At first, I thought this was some kind of triggering device."
156,00:09:16,00:09:19,"It's a black box, like on a plane."
157,00:09:19,00:09:21,It was installed after-market by the rental car company.
158,00:09:21,00:09:26,"It's Wi-Fi. They use it to monitor all their vehicles-- location, speed..."
159,00:09:26,00:09:35,"All right, so, it's not part of a bomb, but it is a black box, so, maybe there's some information in it that would suggest that there was a bomb."
160,00:09:35,00:09:38,Possible. Here is the file of the car's last trip.
161,00:09:38,00:09:41,Merchiston floored it down Rialto Ridge.
162,00:09:41,00:09:44,"He made a left turn, then crashed."
163,00:09:44,00:09:51,These vitals and the GPS indicate a single catastrophic event occurring at the coordinates where the car hit the pole.
164,00:09:51,00:09:55,"So, your explosion happened upon contact."
165,00:09:55,00:09:57,"Well, that doesn't rule out a bomb."
166,00:09:57,00:09:59,"Well, it doesn't support it, either."
167,00:09:59,00:10:00,This might.
168,00:10:00,00:10:04,"I found unusually high levels of aluminum, magnesium, silicon and iron oxide in the wreckage."
169,00:10:04,00:10:09,All are consistent with a thermite explosion.
170,00:10:09,00:10:12,"Well, that would explain the intensity of the blast that we saw on the tape."
171,00:10:12,00:10:13,And the condition of the vehicle.
172,00:10:13,00:10:18,But... we are talking about a car exploding upon impact with a light pole.
173,00:10:18,00:10:24,"And the metals present in thermite are also found in laptops, cell phones, tablets."
174,00:10:24,00:10:29,"I know that you're looking for a different answer, but I think that we need to find something more definitive."
175,00:10:29,00:10:32,(phone rings)
176,00:10:32,00:10:36,"John's attorney is here, and she wants us to release his body."
177,00:10:38,00:10:39,I don't understand.
178,00:10:39,00:10:42,I thought the circumstances of John's accident were pretty clear-cut.
179,00:10:42,00:10:47,"Well, we still have a... few questions, Ms. McDermott, and we thought maybe you could, uh..."
180,00:10:47,00:10:49,you could help us.
181,00:10:49,00:10:51,Questions like what?
182,00:10:51,00:10:58,"Uh, like, what was the story that John was working on which brought him here to Vegas in the last few months?"
183,00:10:58,00:11:00,John.
184,00:11:00,00:11:02,So it's you.
185,00:11:02,00:11:04,(exhales)
186,00:11:04,00:11:06,John always had a weakness for blondes.
187,00:11:08,00:11:10,Your client is dead.
188,00:11:10,00:11:14,Any information you have might help us close this case.
189,00:11:14,00:11:15,"So do me a favor, will you?"
190,00:11:15,00:11:17,"Do you, do you recognize this woman?"
191,00:11:19,00:11:20,No. Why?
192,00:11:20,00:11:23,FINLAY: She was the last person to see John alive.
193,00:11:23,00:11:26,We think that she passed him some information.
194,00:11:26,00:11:28,I've never seen her before.
195,00:11:28,00:11:31,All I know is John was working on an investigative piece.
196,00:11:31,00:11:35,Something to do with computer hacking and domestic intelligence gathering.
197,00:11:35,00:11:37,"So, spying on U.S. citizens."
198,00:11:37,00:11:39,McDERMOTT: Allegedly.
199,00:11:39,00:11:44,"The point person is an Air Force general, Robert Lansdale, out of Nellis."
200,00:11:44,00:11:45,Nellis.
201,00:11:45,00:11:48,That would help explain all the trips to Vegas.
202,00:11:48,00:11:51,"Yeah, and why his accident may not have been an accident."
203,00:11:51,00:11:55,I know John had a gift for telling a good tale.
204,00:11:55,00:11:57,Seducing his listener.
205,00:11:57,00:12:01,"But the truth is, his story was going nowhere."
206,00:12:01,00:12:03,He was frustrated.
207,00:12:03,00:12:04,So you think it was an accident?
208,00:12:04,00:12:08,"I do. Well, you must have known that he had enemies. Yes."
209,00:12:08,00:12:13,"But, also, you must know that John's own worst enemy was always himself."
210,00:12:17,00:12:21,"Yeager, it's Russell. Where are we on the security footage from the Embarcadero?"
211,00:12:22,00:12:24,"Well-Well then, go to another judge."
212,00:12:24,00:12:25,We need those tapes.
213,00:12:25,00:12:30,"I want eyes on Merchiston and this mystery woman, wherever they went, okay?"
214,00:12:30,00:12:32,Call me back.
215,00:12:35,00:12:36,(car engine starts)
216,00:12:42,00:12:43,(grunts)
217,00:12:43,00:12:45,Oh!
218,00:12:47,00:12:48,John?
219,00:12:50,00:12:53,What the hell are you doing? We thought you were ...dead. Dead.
220,00:12:53,00:12:55,"Yeah, I know."
221,00:12:55,00:12:57,We don't have much time. I can't stay here.
222,00:12:57,00:12:59,Where's your car?
223,00:12:59,00:13:01,"Where is your car? We need to get out of here, now."
224,00:13:07,00:13:10,"What the hell is going on, John? I wish I knew."
225,00:13:10,00:13:13,I wish I bloody knew. You know a lot more than I do. Start... Come here.
226,00:13:13,00:13:14,Whose body is in our morgue?
227,00:13:14,00:13:16,"Oh, it's Brian."
228,00:13:16,00:13:18,"Brian Freeman, he's my assistant."
229,00:13:18,00:13:19,He was driving my car.
230,00:13:21,00:13:22,I gave him my coat and my hat.
231,00:13:22,00:13:27,"He took his place behind the wheel of my car and I slipped out the back, and we both know what happened after that. No, no."
232,00:13:27,00:13:29,We identified the body using your dental records.
233,00:13:29,00:13:31,How is that possible?
234,00:13:31,00:13:33,Same way you got a tox report claiming that I was high.
235,00:13:33,00:13:34,And drunk. Don't play games with me!
236,00:13:34,00:13:37,Talk to me! I'm not playing games with you!
237,00:13:37,00:13:38,(whispers): I'm covering a story.
238,00:13:38,00:13:41,"I know. About domestic spying, right?"
239,00:13:41,00:13:45,"So you know it's of a sensitive nature, involving powerful people."
240,00:13:45,00:13:51,"People capable of hacking into a crime lab computer, fabricating a toxicology report labeling me a drunk driver."
241,00:13:51,00:13:53,What about the dental records?
242,00:13:53,00:13:56,"Well, they've got their hackers, and I've got mine."
243,00:13:56,00:13:58,"I-I need your help, DB."
244,00:13:58,00:14:01,"John, I'm just a local cop."
245,00:14:01,00:14:04,"If what you're saying is true, you need to..."
246,00:14:04,00:14:06,you need to talk to a friend of mine at the FBI.
247,00:14:06,00:14:08,"FBI? You're joking, are you?"
248,00:14:08,00:14:10,That's the last place I'm going is the FBI.
249,00:14:12,00:14:14,You are hardly a local cop.
250,00:14:14,00:14:19,"In fact, you and your team-- you're literally the only ones who can help me."
251,00:14:22,00:14:24,"Please, DB."
252,00:14:24,00:14:26,My life's in your hands.
253,00:14:26,00:14:28,"The people who are trying to kill me, the people who..."
254,00:14:28,00:14:29,killed Brian.
255,00:14:29,00:14:32,When they find out their mistake...
256,00:14:32,00:14:33,they will try again.
257,00:14:33,00:14:36,I just need to lay low for a while.
258,00:14:36,00:14:38,Until I can figure out what the hell's on this.
259,00:14:42,00:14:45,I heard you got your hands on the security cam footage from the Embarcadero mall.
260,00:14:45,00:14:47,"Yeah, yeah, I'm going through it right now."
261,00:14:47,00:14:49,"Well, how the hell did you pull that off?"
262,00:14:49,00:14:54,"'Cause I've been on the phone for three hours with four different judges, and I couldn't even get close to a warrant."
263,00:14:54,00:14:57,"Yeager, sometimes you have to know who to ask and how to ask."
264,00:14:57,00:15:05,"There was a very lovely, nice young woman working at Embarcadero operations who was more than happy to give me a hand."
265,00:15:05,00:15:06,"Well, I'm impressed."
266,00:15:06,00:15:07,Thank you. Yeah.
267,00:15:07,00:15:11,"Here she makes the drop-off, and then she just kind of heads off through the crowd."
268,00:15:11,00:15:13,"What's behind the corner, there?"
269,00:15:16,00:15:18,Look at the reflection.
270,00:15:18,00:15:21,Let's see if I can get a taxi number.
271,00:15:22,00:15:23,I'm impressed again.
272,00:15:23,00:15:29,"""T312X."" Call the company, see where the cabbie dropped her off."
273,00:15:32,00:15:33,(knocking on door)
274,00:15:35,00:15:36,I can't believe it.
275,00:15:39,00:15:41,"I'm sorry, I-I had nowhere else to go."
276,00:15:41,00:15:42,"All right, come on in."
277,00:15:45,00:15:52,"Let's start at the beginning, with, uh, the flash drive and the woman who gave it to you. Like I told you, I'm working on a story right now."
278,00:15:52,00:15:54,"Uh, I have an inside man."
279,00:15:54,00:15:58,"He's providing me with information on Project Jericho, which is a domestic spying program."
280,00:15:58,00:16:00,And he goes by the name of Suvari.
281,00:16:00,00:16:04,So the woman was your contact? I don't know who the woman is. I've never met her before.
282,00:16:04,00:16:07,"You see, in the past, Suvari just arranged a dead drop."
283,00:16:07,00:16:10,He'd leave a flash drive somewhere and I'd find it.
284,00:16:10,00:16:11,"But not this time. No, no."
285,00:16:11,00:16:14,This time I told him I actually need to look him in the eye.
286,00:16:14,00:16:19,"Before I publish my story, I need to be assured that the information that he's providing on Project Jericho is genuine."
287,00:16:19,00:16:22,"Specifically, about the man who's-who's running things."
288,00:16:22,00:16:23,Who's some Air Force general.
289,00:16:23,00:16:26,Robert Lansdale.
290,00:16:26,00:16:28,"How did you...? Oh, that's all right, go on."
291,00:16:28,00:16:33,"Right. Well, amongst other things right now, they're using drones for domestic surveillance."
292,00:16:33,00:16:34,Question is: who are they watching?
293,00:16:34,00:16:36,And who's watching the watchmen?
294,00:16:36,00:16:38,Precisely. Um...
295,00:16:38,00:16:44,I was told that the information off this flash drive would make Snowden's leaks look like a minor blip on the radar.
296,00:16:44,00:16:47,I'm assuming that the files are encrypted.
297,00:16:47,00:16:50,I had the decryption key on my laptop.
298,00:16:50,00:16:51,That was in my car.
299,00:16:51,00:16:53,Which is where we come in.
300,00:16:53,00:16:55,Assuming that you can crack it.
301,00:16:55,00:17:00,"The safest place for you right now is to stay here. First, we need to find out what's on this flash drive."
302,00:17:00,00:17:02,Then we can figure out what our next move is.
303,00:17:02,00:17:04,Where are you going?
304,00:17:04,00:17:08,I'm gonna go back to the lab. The three of us are the only people that know that John's still alive.
305,00:17:08,00:17:09,Let-Let's keep it that way.
306,00:17:09,00:17:12,I'll call you when I get something.
307,00:17:13,00:17:16,(thunder rumbling)
308,00:17:16,00:17:22,YEAGER: The cab company said our mystery woman was dropped off at the Palermo last night at 11:15.
309,00:17:22,00:17:25,Hotel has her registered under the name Emily Rey.
310,00:17:25,00:17:28,"Security checked her room, she wasn't there."
311,00:17:28,00:17:31,"An hour ago, we get a call out here-- 419."
312,00:17:33,00:17:35,She fits the description.
313,00:17:35,00:17:37,"Super Dave, what's the word?"
314,00:17:37,00:17:40,TOD's approximately six hours ago.
315,00:17:40,00:17:44,And we got blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
316,00:17:44,00:17:45,STOKES: Yeah.
317,00:17:47,00:17:52,"All this spatter, cast-off, I'd be willing to bet you she was hit more than a couple of times, yeah?"
318,00:17:52,00:17:54,Definitely.
319,00:17:54,00:17:56,"YEAGER: Hey, we got more blood over here."
320,00:17:56,00:17:59,Gravitational drops...
321,00:17:59,00:18:02,could've come off the weapon.
322,00:18:04,00:18:05,Nick...
323,00:18:07,00:18:08,(thunder rumbling)
324,00:18:10,00:18:12,"STOKES: Oh, yeah."
325,00:18:12,00:18:15,"Got a print and blood. And a good one, at that."
326,00:18:15,00:18:18,"Just sent the photo to the lab, they're running a check."
327,00:18:18,00:18:20,(phone chimes)
328,00:18:20,00:18:21,Just got a hit.
329,00:18:21,00:18:22,That was quick.
330,00:18:22,00:18:24,What the hell?
331,00:18:24,00:18:25,What's wrong?
332,00:18:25,00:18:26,"Hey, Dave. Yeah."
333,00:18:26,00:18:29,"You say the time of death was six hours ago, right?"
334,00:18:29,00:18:30,That's right. Why?
335,00:18:32,00:18:34,Our killer's a dead man.
336,00:18:39,00:18:40,Greg...
337,00:18:40,00:18:41,I got something I need you to do.
338,00:18:41,00:18:43,"Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something."
339,00:18:43,00:18:44,"Well, this takes priority."
340,00:18:44,00:18:46,A flash drive? (cell phone chimes)
341,00:18:46,00:18:47,Files on it are encrypted.
342,00:18:47,00:18:49,I need you to open them up for me.
343,00:18:49,00:18:51,"Oh, damn it."
344,00:18:51,00:18:52,Is everything all right?
345,00:18:52,00:18:54,Just-Just do it.
346,00:18:55,00:18:56,STOKES: DB...
347,00:18:56,00:19:02,"We got a problem. I need to talk to you about that Merchiston car wreck. All right, come in, come in."
348,00:19:02,00:19:06,"Well, there's something just not right about it."
349,00:19:06,00:19:07,(sighs)
350,00:19:09,00:19:14,"Tell me what you know. Yeager and I tracked down the mystery woman, the one that met Merchiston in the mall."
351,00:19:14,00:19:16,I'm pretty sure those two hooked up again later.
352,00:19:16,00:19:17,Why do you say that?
353,00:19:17,00:19:19,'Cause she's dead.
354,00:19:19,00:19:23,"Beaten to death with a crowbar, and Merchiston's fingerprints right there on the murder weapon."
355,00:19:23,00:19:26,"Now, she was killed six hours ago."
356,00:19:26,00:19:28,His car crash was 36 hours ago.
357,00:19:28,00:19:29,"I mean, you do the math."
358,00:19:29,00:19:32,Are you absolutely positive about the fingerprint?
359,00:19:32,00:19:34,It's in the victim's blood.
360,00:19:34,00:19:38,"Listen, Merchiston is still alive, and he's a stone-cold killer."
361,00:19:39,00:19:41,What's going on?
362,00:19:41,00:19:43,"(phone buzzing, shower running)"
363,00:19:59,00:20:01,(gasps)
364,00:20:01,00:20:02,(sighs)
365,00:20:02,00:20:04,You scared me.
366,00:20:04,00:20:06,That wasn't my intention.
367,00:20:06,00:20:09,"John, I-I..."
368,00:20:09,00:20:15,Something happened since the last time I saw you.
369,00:20:15,00:20:16,What?
370,00:20:16,00:20:19,I don't want to talk about it.
371,00:20:30,00:20:32,Russell left me a message.
372,00:20:32,00:20:33,Really? What about?
373,00:20:33,00:20:34,I'm checking.
374,00:20:45,00:20:46,What's the matter?
375,00:20:49,00:20:50,Why are you looking at me like that?
376,00:20:53,00:20:54,FBI! Drop the gun.
377,00:20:55,00:20:59,"CSI Finlay, gun on the floor."
378,00:20:59,00:21:00,Now!
379,00:21:03,00:21:04,"Give me the gun, Julie."
380,00:21:06,00:21:09,We have to take you in. Both of you.
381,00:21:23,00:21:27,(laptop blipping rapidly as it downloads)
382,00:21:27,00:21:28,(blipping stops)
383,00:21:36,00:21:37,CSI Russell.
384,00:21:37,00:21:40,"Special Agent Sturgis, FBI."
385,00:21:40,00:21:42,I'm going to need to read you your rights.
386,00:21:42,00:21:44,That's all right...
387,00:21:44,00:21:46,I think I know them.
388,00:21:55,00:21:56,CSI Russell.
389,00:21:56,00:21:58,Sorry to keep you waiting.
390,00:21:58,00:22:00,"Well, it's a long trip from Nellis."
391,00:22:00,00:22:02,"General Lansdale, right?"
392,00:22:02,00:22:06,No uniform-- I'm guessing this conversation's off the record.
393,00:22:08,00:22:10,John Merchiston...
394,00:22:10,00:22:13,man's a murderer.
395,00:22:13,00:22:16,"But worse than that, he's a threat to this country."
396,00:22:16,00:22:18,Can you prove either one of those allegations?
397,00:22:18,00:22:20,FBI will.
398,00:22:20,00:22:23,"At this moment, they're securing all the evidence from your lab."
399,00:22:23,00:22:28,You need to know that my people had no knowledge of this whatsoever. Does that include CSI Finlay?
400,00:22:29,00:22:33,"Despite your best efforts to alert her, she and Mr. Merchiston are in custody."
401,00:22:35,00:22:37,I know...
402,00:22:37,00:22:40,that you have a relationship with John Merchiston.
403,00:22:40,00:22:42,Maybe you trust him-- but you shouldn't.
404,00:22:42,00:22:47,"I'm not sure who I should be trusting right now, General."
405,00:22:47,00:22:50,"Well, you certainly come by that honestly."
406,00:22:50,00:22:52,I know about your parents.
407,00:22:52,00:22:55,About their activities during the '60s.
408,00:22:55,00:22:59,"But you, you... you became a cop."
409,00:22:59,00:23:02,"That says a lot about you, about them."
410,00:23:02,00:23:06,Must feel sort of odd sitting on that side of the table.
411,00:23:06,00:23:08,What do you want?
412,00:23:08,00:23:13,I want to know what Merchiston told you about a gentleman named Suvari.
413,00:23:13,00:23:14,He didn't tell me anything.
414,00:23:14,00:23:18,"I'm here as a courtesy, Mr. Russell."
415,00:23:18,00:23:21,The FBI can continue this conversation.
416,00:23:21,00:23:23,(clears throat softly) What about my lab?
417,00:23:23,00:23:30,"I don't think it'll look very good for either one of us, General, if the wheels of justice grind to a halt."
418,00:23:34,00:23:37,I'll give you an opportunity to make arrangements with your team.
419,00:23:39,00:23:41,You're a lucky man.
420,00:23:41,00:23:47,"You got a family, good job, so much to live for."
421,00:23:47,00:23:52,You should know from personal experience the cost of misplaced loyalty.
422,00:24:13,00:24:20,STURGIS: We believe your friend John Merchiston has been receiving leaks of classified information vital to our nation's security.
423,00:24:20,00:24:25,"Leaks from an inside source, goes by the name Suvari."
424,00:24:25,00:24:26,I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah?
425,00:24:26,00:24:30,"Obviously, you know one thing-- Merchiston faked his own death."
426,00:24:30,00:24:34,"When he realized we were closing in on him, he set up his assistant."
427,00:24:34,00:24:35,Murdered him.
428,00:24:35,00:24:40,"Then he murdered this woman, Emily Rey, the only other person who could connect him to this Suvari."
429,00:24:40,00:24:42,Looks like you got it all figured out.
430,00:24:42,00:24:43,Why do you need me?
431,00:24:43,00:24:48,"Well, maybe this Emily Rey isn't the only connection to Suvari."
432,00:24:48,00:24:52,"Well, if that's the case, why didn't John kill me?"
433,00:24:52,00:24:55,I like to think we saved your life.
434,00:24:55,00:25:01,"Now it's your turn-- to help save the lives of perhaps thousands, if these security leaks are allowed to go unchecked."
435,00:25:01,00:25:03,I don't buy it.
436,00:25:03,00:25:05,(scoffs)
437,00:25:05,00:25:09,That's... not the cooperative attitude I was looking for.
438,00:25:09,00:25:17,"I don't know if you're protecting Merchiston because you've fallen for him or his politics, or maybe he's just a great lay."
439,00:25:17,00:25:21,"Honestly, I don't care. Whatever pillow talk you two shared, you are gonna give it up."
440,00:25:21,00:25:24,At the risk of sounding like your British boy toy...
441,00:25:24,00:25:26,we could go all night.
442,00:25:26,00:25:27,"You know what, Agent?"
443,00:25:27,00:25:28,Go screw yourself!
444,00:25:28,00:25:30,"That's what you wanted to say, right?"
445,00:25:30,00:25:33,"BRASS: Finlay, I advise you not to say another word."
446,00:25:33,00:25:35,"You're here as an observer, Captain."
447,00:25:35,00:25:37,This is my house; these are my people.
448,00:25:37,00:25:40,"And if you don't start acting nice, I'm gonna kick your FBI ass right out of here."
449,00:25:48,00:25:50,Russell. Russell.
450,00:25:50,00:25:54,"Hey, I got your message. Looks like Finn and I are gonna be here for a little while."
451,00:25:54,00:25:59,Merchiston's being charged with willful communication of national defense information.
452,00:25:59,00:26:01,And murder.
453,00:26:01,00:26:03,He's letting his lawyer do the talking right now.
454,00:26:03,00:26:08,"According to them, we harbored someone who stole secrets, faked his own death, and then murdered two people."
455,00:26:08,00:26:13,Unless we can prove that someone was setting Merchiston up the whole time.
456,00:26:13,00:26:19,"I mean, we have his bloody fingerprint on the murder weapon-- that makes for a pretty good argument. I know, but..."
457,00:26:19,00:26:23,he once did a forensic field training with Scotland Yard.
458,00:26:23,00:26:28,So he's not stupid enough to leave his bloody fingerprint behind.
459,00:26:28,00:26:30,"Look, you're the boss now, bud."
460,00:26:30,00:26:33,"Get us out of here, will you?"
461,00:27:21,00:27:27,"FBI yanked all the files on the Merchiston case, but I still had a photo of the bloody fingerprint in my phone. Check it out."
462,00:27:27,00:27:29,Tell me what you see or what you don't see.
463,00:27:29,00:27:32,BRODY: Ridge detail's all there.
464,00:27:32,00:27:34,But there are no pores.
465,00:27:34,00:27:36,How is that even possible?
466,00:27:36,00:27:39,"We've seen this before, haven't we, Greg?"
467,00:27:39,00:27:40,The Millander case.
468,00:27:40,00:27:41,Mm-hmm.
469,00:27:41,00:27:47,"A serial killer made a mold of Grissom's print in latex, planted it at a crime scene."
470,00:27:47,00:27:51,"But unlike skin, latex gives you ridge detail but no pores."
471,00:27:51,00:27:56,"Russell was right-- this whole thing's a setup, from the Emily Rey murder to the car crash-- all of it."
472,00:27:56,00:27:58,Sounds pretty sophisticated.
473,00:27:58,00:28:00,Do we think the FBI's involved?
474,00:28:00,00:28:02,"STOKES: No... no, I think they're just doing their job."
475,00:28:02,00:28:04,"Well, then who is it? I don't know."
476,00:28:04,00:28:10,But I don't even know where to start looking now that they've walked off with everything.
477,00:28:10,00:28:12,Maybe not everything.
478,00:28:14,00:28:17,Russell gave this to me right after Merchiston came back from the dead.
479,00:28:17,00:28:24,The guy's accused of stealing classified information-- it might be on there. It might also show who's trying to set Merchiston up.
480,00:28:24,00:28:26,Even help spring Russell and Finn.
481,00:28:26,00:28:31,"BRODY: With all these eyes on us, it's gonna be almost impossible to do the job."
482,00:28:32,00:28:39,"All eyes are on us, but I can think of somebody who might be able to fly under the radar."
483,00:28:44,00:28:46,"Hey, Nick."
484,00:28:46,00:28:48,Hey. This was left at Reception. What is it?
485,00:28:48,00:28:51,Nevada Wireless-- looks like a new phone.
486,00:28:51,00:28:52,I didn't order a phone.
487,00:29:07,00:29:10,(music playing in distance)
488,00:29:13,00:29:15,Hi. Hi.
489,00:29:15,00:29:17,"I'll have a cup of coffee, please."
490,00:29:17,00:29:19,Sure. What flavor?
491,00:29:19,00:29:21,Coffee-flavored.
492,00:29:21,00:29:24,"BARISTA: That'll be $1.35, sir."
493,00:29:24,00:29:26,Keep it.
494,00:29:26,00:29:27,Thank you.
495,00:29:38,00:29:40,You're Suvari?
496,00:29:40,00:29:46,"I'm not, but... he reached out to me, (over radio): said he could help my client and your CSI friends."
497,00:29:46,00:29:48,Okay. Where is he?
498,00:29:48,00:29:49,I'm supposed to take you to him.
499,00:29:57,00:30:01,"So, you, uh, decrypted the files on the flash drive I gave you?"
500,00:30:01,00:30:08,Files are classified Department of Defense documents relating to Project Jericho: the use of drones to listen in on communications.
501,00:30:08,00:30:14,"Now, this is all in the development stages, but definitely something DoD would not want to go public."
502,00:30:14,00:30:21,"All right, but is it serious enough that someone from the government would be willing to stage a fake car crash, murder a woman, just to..."
503,00:30:21,00:30:24,keep it a secret? Just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not following you.
504,00:30:24,00:30:26,"In this case, backseat driving."
505,00:30:26,00:30:29,What do you mean?
506,00:30:29,00:30:31,One of the files references-- (footsteps approaching)
507,00:30:34,00:30:54,"One of the files refers to Wi-Fi technology, which enables a user to hack a car's onboard CPUs-- specifically, after-market black boxes, like the one that was installed in Merchiston's rental car. So you're saying that they've developed a software that allows you to take control of a car... remotely."
508,00:30:54,00:30:56,And remotely crash it.
509,00:30:56,00:31:03,There's also references to enhancing the effects of the accident with a thermite cocktail-- ka-boom!
510,00:31:03,00:31:07,"All right, well, that still doesn't mean that someone from the government is behind all of this."
511,00:31:07,00:31:10,"For all we know, it could be this guy Suvari."
512,00:31:19,00:31:22,You're not gonna tell me where we're going?
513,00:31:22,00:31:24,You want to meet Suvari or don't you?
514,00:31:24,00:31:27,There's a rest stop outside of Searchlight.
515,00:31:27,00:31:29,He said to wait for him there.
516,00:31:33,00:31:36,(engine accelerating)
517,00:31:36,00:31:38,"Hey, you mind slowing down?"
518,00:31:38,00:31:39,I'd like to get there in one piece.
519,00:31:39,00:31:41,It's not me-- my foot's off the pedal.
520,00:31:41,00:31:43,Turn off the cruise control.
521,00:31:43,00:31:45,"No, it's not on."
522,00:31:48,00:31:50,Try the brakes. They're not working!
523,00:31:53,00:31:55,"All right, all right, just-just stay cool, we got this."
524,00:31:57,00:32:01,What the hell?!
525,00:32:01,00:32:02,(truck horn blaring)
526,00:32:02,00:32:04,(McDermott panting)
527,00:32:05,00:32:06,(engine roaring)
528,00:32:16,00:32:18,"(engine roaring, tires screeching)"
529,00:32:22,00:32:24,(tires screeching)
530,00:32:32,00:32:34,(both panting)
531,00:32:36,00:32:38,What was that?
532,00:32:38,00:32:42,"I don't know, but I'm getting the feeling we just took the same kind of ride that..."
533,00:32:42,00:32:44,that John's car took.
534,00:32:58,00:33:00,Wasn't that the... the coffee guy from the mall?
535,00:33:09,00:33:12,Well...
536,00:33:12,00:33:15,"either he just tried to kill us, or he just saved us."
537,00:33:15,00:33:17,"Either way, he left us this."
538,00:33:28,00:33:29,(computer blipping)
539,00:33:31,00:33:34,(camera shutter clicking)
540,00:33:57,00:33:58,(camera shutter clicking)
541,00:34:14,00:34:17,I told you the truth would set us all free.
542,00:34:18,00:34:20,Like I told you...
543,00:34:20,00:34:21,we're on the same side.
544,00:34:22,00:34:24,Call 'em.
545,00:34:33,00:34:34,Hey. (laughing): Hey.
546,00:34:34,00:34:35,"Hey, welcome back."
547,00:34:35,00:34:37,"Good to be back, thank you very much."
548,00:34:37,00:34:40,We heard you and John's attorney had a close call.
549,00:34:40,00:34:43,We did. One that was headed off by your friend Suvari.
550,00:34:43,00:34:45,You actually met him? So did you.
551,00:34:45,00:34:46,He served you coffee.
552,00:34:48,00:34:50,"Okay, what have we got here?"
553,00:34:50,00:34:57,"Evidence-- proof of the attack on Mr. Merchiston's life using a tactic called ""Boston Brakes."" Boston Brakes?"
554,00:34:57,00:35:00,So-called because that was the first place it was used.
555,00:35:00,00:35:02,"At least, according to mythology."
556,00:35:02,00:35:08,And that's all I thought it was till I saw the files your colleague Hodges decrypted.
557,00:35:08,00:35:19,"Project Jericho included a DoD program that developed technology to hack onboard computers in cars, and I think that Suvari wants us to know it's what happened to this woman and her son, as well."
558,00:35:19,00:35:25,Cheryl Perez worked for DoD as a programmer on Project Jericho.
559,00:35:25,00:35:29,Ms. Perez resigned amid rumors of an affair with a high-ranking officer.
560,00:35:29,00:35:30,General Lansdale?
561,00:35:30,00:35:31,Name never surfaced.
562,00:35:31,00:35:32,"Yeah, but it makes sense."
563,00:35:32,00:35:39,Suvari told me he was working on a story that was going to send the walls of Project Jericho tumbling down.
564,00:35:39,00:35:44,"Clearly, he's suggesting Lansdale's behind the murder of this woman to cover up the affair."
565,00:35:44,00:35:48,There's the chance that the child found in the back of the car is his son.
566,00:35:48,00:35:52,FINLAY: So now he's targeting anyone who comes close to the truth.
567,00:35:52,00:35:55,"STURGIS: Yes, I agree that's what this all looks like, but there are still missing pieces."
568,00:35:55,00:35:57,This Suvari is a mystery man.
569,00:35:57,00:36:01,"Coffee vendor said he rented the stand just a couple of times, paid cash."
570,00:36:01,00:36:03,But we don't know who he is or where he's from.
571,00:36:03,00:36:08,"Without him, all we really have are allegations against a high-ranking Air Force officer."
572,00:36:08,00:36:10,So we need to find this Suvari.
573,00:36:10,00:36:11,We're working on it.
574,00:36:11,00:36:14,We ran diagnostics on this device.
575,00:36:14,00:36:21,"Suvari definitely used it to override whoever was hacking the car that we were in, but, in trying to save us, I think he left himself exposed."
576,00:36:21,00:36:23,He left behind a cyber footprint.
577,00:36:23,00:36:27,Greg is working on that ISP right now.
578,00:36:27,00:36:29,(engines revving)
579,00:36:46,00:36:48,You sure you found the right place?
580,00:36:48,00:36:51,ISP traced here.
581,00:36:51,00:36:52,STOKES: How? It's not on the grid.
582,00:36:52,00:36:55,You don't even get cell phone service out here.
583,00:36:55,00:36:56,"Well, maybe that's the point."
584,00:36:56,00:36:58,(muffled rock music playing)
585,00:36:58,00:36:59,STOKES: Somebody's home.
586,00:37:03,00:37:05,(rock music blaring)
587,00:37:26,00:37:29,STOKES (loudly over music): Yeah.
588,00:37:29,00:37:31,"Yeah, photos."
589,00:37:31,00:37:32,He's definitely been watching.
590,00:37:32,00:37:35,Bloody duffel bag.
591,00:37:35,00:37:36,Bloody gloves.
592,00:37:38,00:37:40,Emily Rey's wallet.
593,00:37:52,00:37:55,"STOKES: Yeah, yeah, that's him."
594,00:37:55,00:37:57,"That's-that's Suvari, or whoever he is."
595,00:38:01,00:38:03,"(music stops, computer chirps)"
596,00:38:05,00:38:09,"""To whom it may concern..."" What is that, a suicide note?"
597,00:38:09,00:38:11,"Oh, it's more than that."
598,00:38:11,00:38:13,It's a confession... to all the murders.
599,00:38:16,00:38:20,"I don't buy it. Oh, me, either."
600,00:38:20,00:38:22,"This evidence, the note..."
601,00:38:22,00:38:25,Somebody sure is giving us the hard sell.
602,00:38:29,00:38:31,"Sorry, General."
603,00:38:31,00:38:35,Guess it's my turn to keep you waiting.
604,00:38:35,00:38:38,"Well, I hope it's for a good reason 'cause I'm a busy man."
605,00:38:38,00:38:40,"Yes, you are."
606,00:38:40,00:38:44,You wanted information on Suvari.
607,00:38:44,00:38:46,"Well, we-we found him."
608,00:38:46,00:38:51,"But then again, I think you know that, because you found him first, didn't you?"
609,00:38:51,00:38:53,His real name is Joseph Powers.
610,00:38:53,00:38:55,Former Army Intelligence.
611,00:38:55,00:38:58,More recently employed by Ceressus Logistics.
612,00:38:58,00:39:03,"He was a-a contractor assigned to Project Jericho, wasn't he?"
613,00:39:03,00:39:05,I don't recognize him.
614,00:39:05,00:39:07,"But then again, I have a lot of people working under me."
615,00:39:07,00:39:11,How about Cheryl Perez?
616,00:39:11,00:39:13,You recognize her?
617,00:39:13,00:39:14,I heard about her car accident.
618,00:39:14,00:39:16,Tragic.
619,00:39:16,00:39:17,"Yes, it was."
620,00:39:17,00:39:19,We were all deeply saddened.
621,00:39:19,00:39:22,"Especially, evidentially, Joseph Powers."
622,00:39:22,00:39:26,"I mean, he-he resigned a week after the accident."
623,00:39:26,00:39:31,"He just fell right off the grid, until, of course, he started reaching out to John Merchiston."
624,00:39:31,00:39:33,"You remember John, don't you?"
625,00:39:33,00:39:35,Where's this going?
626,00:39:35,00:39:39,Did Cheryl Perez threaten to go to your wife or your boss?
627,00:39:39,00:39:42,Or did she want money to help support her child?
628,00:39:42,00:39:43,Your child?
629,00:39:43,00:39:49,"A man with a good job and a family has so much to live for, right?"
630,00:39:49,00:39:53,Or... kill for.
631,00:39:53,00:39:55,I would be very careful about what you say.
632,00:39:55,00:39:59,Why? Am I about to have a car accident?
633,00:39:59,00:40:08,"See, I know what you've done. You've used the entire national security apparatus, all of their technology, to cover up an affair."
634,00:40:08,00:40:09,You don't know what I've done.
635,00:40:12,00:40:14,"And even if you did, you wouldn't understand."
636,00:40:14,00:40:17,"You're not a soldier, a patriot."
637,00:40:17,00:40:26,"You are just another child of the '60s who cloaks himself in principle, while our enemies plot to bring chaos to our streets."
638,00:40:26,00:40:28,"Well, I am not gonna let that happen."
639,00:40:28,00:40:33,And I will stop anybody who gets in my way.
640,00:40:33,00:40:39,"You know, my-my hippie parents might not have taught me a lot, but they did teach me about patience."
641,00:40:39,00:40:45,"I may not be able to prove anything today, but you have involved way too many people here, General."
642,00:40:45,00:40:55,"And someday, there's gonna be another Joseph Powers, another person of conscience, and when they step up, oh, I'm going to be right there, waiting patiently for you."
643,00:40:56,00:40:58,"You're dismissed, General."
644,00:41:02,00:41:05,I thought your flight left in the morning.
645,00:41:05,00:41:07,So did I.
646,00:41:07,00:41:09,The editor needs to see me immediately.
647,00:41:09,00:41:11,Mm.
648,00:41:13,00:41:15,It's the truth. I believe you.
649,00:41:15,00:41:20,"Russell is not giving up on Lansdale, and neither am I."
650,00:41:20,00:41:22,I'll be back.
651,00:41:22,00:41:24,Good to know.
652,00:41:26,00:41:29,"Look, uh..."
653,00:41:29,00:41:40,"that thing that, uh, you didn't want to talk about-- should you ever change your mind, I'm an excellent listener."
654,00:41:42,00:41:45,Thank you. I appreciate that.
655,00:41:45,00:41:47,Yeah.
656,00:41:47,00:41:49,Be safe.
657,00:41:49,00:41:51,"Yeah. You, too."
658,00:41:59,00:42:01,Be well.
659,00:42:01,00:42:03,"Yeah. You, too."
