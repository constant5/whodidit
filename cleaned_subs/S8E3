0,00:00:21,00:00:24,MAN: You may believe...
1,00:00:25,00:00:29,...that you have to die before the Judgment comes...
2,00:00:31,00:00:33,...but I say the Fire...
3,00:00:34,00:00:37,...is not around the corner.
4,00:00:37,00:00:41,The Fire is not a-waiting.
5,00:00:41,00:00:43,The Fire is not a-wanting.
6,00:00:44,00:00:47,The Fire has already come.
7,00:00:48,00:01:01,"As we mortals drink, gamble, and fornicate our way through this world, deaf to Hell's Bells' thundering toll, the clock of damnation has already struck midnight."
8,00:01:03,00:01:06,We're cooked... done!
9,00:01:07,00:01:10,Stick a fork in the ass of the human race and...
10,00:01:10,00:01:18,turn us over on Satan's spit because we all are notgoingto Hell.
11,00:01:18,00:01:23,"As surely as we stand in Las Vegas, Nevada..."
12,00:01:26,00:01:29,...I say...
13,00:01:30,00:01:35,...we are in Hell now.
14,00:01:35,00:01:36,(garbled radio transmission)
15,00:01:39,00:01:42,WILLOWS: Why are we parking in an alley two blocks from the crime scene?
16,00:01:42,00:01:46,"You know, Sanitation's flushing out a sewer line and we don't want to block their trucks."
17,00:01:46,00:01:48,Whoa.
18,00:01:48,00:01:50,What do we got here?
19,00:01:50,00:01:52,"Hey, guy."
20,00:01:52,00:01:53,Hey.
21,00:01:56,00:01:59,Looks like we got a male D.B.
22,00:01:59,00:02:00,I'll call it in.
23,00:02:00,00:02:01,"You got it, Mitch?"
24,00:02:01,00:02:03,I'll contain the scene.
25,00:02:15,00:02:17,(Spanish program playing on TV)
26,00:02:26,00:02:31,"Man was shot execution-style, .22 to the back of the head."
27,00:02:33,00:02:35,"Woman was shot as well, bound and gagged."
28,00:02:35,00:02:40,"Guest next door complained about the noise, manager finally called the police, Unis found this."
29,00:02:42,00:02:46,"Well, I don't see any luggage, wedding rings still on the fingers."
30,00:02:46,00:02:50,Probably rules out robbery but not infidelity.
31,00:02:51,00:02:53,One gets to watch the other one die.
32,00:02:53,00:02:54,(gasping)
33,00:02:54,00:02:56,"(woman screams, gun cocks)"
34,00:02:58,00:03:02,Maybe someone was trying to teach them a lesson.
35,00:03:02,00:03:06,Did you guys happen to see the Fitzgerald's thermometer on your way over?
36,00:03:06,00:03:07,"Oh, yeah."
37,00:03:07,00:03:09,109.
38,00:03:09,00:03:11,Hot as hell. Anything under 110 is manageable.
39,00:03:11,00:03:15,"Above that, the crime rate always goes way up."
40,00:03:15,00:03:16,(siren wailing)
41,00:03:16,00:03:18,(woman screams)
42,00:03:18,00:03:19,Sounds like it's getting hotter.
43,00:03:53,00:03:55,(indistinct radio transmission)
44,00:03:56,00:03:58,(siren chirps)
45,00:04:44,00:04:47,"Well, there's no wallet or I.D. on this one either."
46,00:04:48,00:04:49,This looks like a wet spot.
47,00:04:52,00:04:55,(beeps)
48,00:04:56,00:04:59,(beeps)
49,00:04:59,00:05:00,Semen.
50,00:05:00,00:05:02,There's no indication she was re-dressed.
51,00:05:02,00:05:05,It doesn't look like sexual assault.
52,00:05:05,00:05:08,WILLOWS: So... middle class couple...
53,00:05:09,00:05:13,"...takes a walk on the wild side, checks into this dump for..."
54,00:05:13,00:05:16,some fine dining and romance.
55,00:05:16,00:05:20,"Somebody breaks in, kills the man, and tortures the woman."
56,00:05:20,00:05:22,For what?
57,00:05:22,00:05:23,Maybe it's a drug thing.
58,00:05:23,00:05:29,"Well, wouldn't be the first time some nice folks from Henderson came east of Fremont to score."
59,00:05:29,00:05:31,Did you find any drug residue or paraphernalia?
60,00:05:31,00:05:32,Not yet.
61,00:05:32,00:05:35,Maybe tox'll find it in them.
62,00:05:56,00:05:59,We have one too many Bibles.
63,00:05:59,00:06:01,I don't think they helped.
64,00:06:01,00:06:03,So you didn't hear or see anything suspicious?
65,00:06:03,00:06:04,This job-- you kidding me?
66,00:06:04,00:06:06,That's all I see and all I hear.
67,00:06:06,00:06:07,Is that the register?
68,00:06:07,00:06:08,"Give it to me, give it to me."
69,00:06:08,00:06:10,Room 106.
70,00:06:10,00:06:13,"Paid for the week, cash in advance, signed 'em in myself."
71,00:06:13,00:06:14,We got a problem.
72,00:06:14,00:06:15,What's the problem?
73,00:06:15,00:06:16,Your handwriting sucks.
74,00:06:17,00:06:18,What the hell does this say?
75,00:06:18,00:06:20,"Oh, uh... oh, that."
76,00:06:21,00:06:24,"That's the name here and that's, that's a, well, that's an ""A."" Uh..."
77,00:06:24,00:06:33,"and the license plate... uh... that's an ""N"" and-- oh-- that's a ""V."" That's ""Nevada."" You think?"
78,00:06:40,00:06:42,SIDLE: Green bloat stage.
79,00:06:42,00:06:45,He's been here at least 18 hours.
80,00:06:45,00:06:48,"Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose, eat the brains?"
81,00:06:49,00:06:51,I would. Protein.
82,00:06:51,00:06:54,Ants are scavengers; they tend to stay on the surface.
83,00:06:54,00:06:57,You think dead skin tastes better than brains?
84,00:06:57,00:07:00,"Well, they will go for brains late in decomp, after all the skin is gone."
85,00:07:00,00:07:02,Do ants have taste buds?
86,00:07:02,00:07:03,Ronnie...
87,00:07:03,00:07:06,I'm going to have to limit you to 20 questions per case.
88,00:07:06,00:07:07,Really?
89,00:07:07,00:07:09,Nineteen?
90,00:07:09,00:07:10,"BRASS: Hey, Sara."
91,00:07:10,00:07:13,Hey... Jim.
92,00:07:13,00:07:15,So... enjoying the sunshine?
93,00:07:15,00:07:16,Not really.
94,00:07:16,00:07:18,D.B. is a derelict.
95,00:07:18,00:07:20,I'm kind of surprised to see you investigating this.
96,00:07:20,00:07:21,"Oh, I'm not working this."
97,00:07:21,00:07:23,I'm working the double homicide over at the Rancho Center Motel.
98,00:07:23,00:07:25,We're just doing a neighborhood sweep for suspects.
99,00:07:26,00:07:27,You're new. I'm Jim Brass.
100,00:07:27,00:07:28,Yeah. Ronnie Lake. Right.
101,00:07:29,00:07:29,Ronnie Lake.
102,00:07:30,00:07:31,Like Veronica.
103,00:07:31,00:07:33,"You know, the actress? Sullivan's Travels?"
104,00:07:33,00:07:36,I think that's my dad's favorite movie.
105,00:07:36,00:07:37,Right.
106,00:07:39,00:07:40,"DISPATCHER (over radio): 203-Charlie, Control."
107,00:07:40,00:07:41,We have a few hookers who used the motel.
108,00:07:41,00:07:43,They're willing to talk.
109,00:07:43,00:07:45,"Yeah, 203-Charlie, I'm on my way."
110,00:07:45,00:07:47,Got to run. Okay.
111,00:07:47,00:07:52,"So I got a hit off of the print on the motel room's ""Do Not Disturb"" sign."
112,00:07:52,00:07:54,Drug dealer with priors for assault-- nice.
113,00:07:54,00:08:08,"Yes, well, don't get too excited because I got another hit off of the telephone-- pedophile-- and I got one off of the dresser-- rapist-- and another one off of the bed frame-- a prostitute, a pimp, and another prostitute."
114,00:08:08,00:08:10,"Is that it? For felonies, yes."
115,00:08:10,00:08:12,"You want misdemeanors, too?"
116,00:08:12,00:08:14,So the blood on the shirt belongs to your victims.
117,00:08:14,00:08:20,The high velocity spatter on the front is a mixture of both and the blood drops on the left sleeve appear to solely belong to the woman.
118,00:08:20,00:08:21,Probably cast-off from the beating.
119,00:08:21,00:08:28,"Now, the pattern on the sleeve has a straight line on the outside, and then a matching band of spatter on the inside."
120,00:08:29,00:08:30,So the killer rolled up his sleeves?
121,00:08:30,00:08:32,He had a lot of work to do.
122,00:08:32,00:08:36,Speaking of which-- The wet spot.
123,00:08:36,00:08:44,"The sex stain was a male- female combo, both unknown, but the female shared alleles at all loci with both of the victims."
124,00:08:44,00:08:47,It's their daughter.
125,00:08:48,00:08:50,The parents weren't that old.
126,00:08:50,00:08:54,The girl would be a teenager at most.
127,00:08:54,00:08:58,"So the killer caps mom and dad, rapes the girl, and takes her with him."
128,00:08:59,00:09:01,"If you've got a missing kid, I've got a pedophile."
129,00:09:03,00:09:05,Alistair Rhodes.
130,00:09:05,00:09:07,Busted in August '94 for child molestation.
131,00:09:07,00:09:11,"That's pre-CODIS, so there's no DNA on file to match."
132,00:09:11,00:09:13,Alistair Rhodes.
133,00:09:13,00:09:15,I remember this guy.
134,00:09:15,00:09:19,"He was a lounge singer, called himself ""Three Miles of Bad."" It was all over the news."
135,00:09:19,00:09:23,"Well, according to the sheet, he served five years and made parole."
136,00:09:23,00:09:25,A registered sex offender.
137,00:09:25,00:09:27,We know where he lives.
138,00:09:27,00:09:30,You think those are your fingers itching to pick up the spike?
139,00:09:30,00:09:32,Your hands injecting your veins?
140,00:09:32,00:09:37,"""Satan finds mischief still in idle hands."" BRASS: Alistair Rhodes."
141,00:09:40,00:09:46,"Most people around here just call me ""Reverend."" Hey, why don't you guys go Super-Size those?"
142,00:09:46,00:09:50,"So, Reverend, I hear that confession is good for the soul."
143,00:09:50,00:09:51,You have anything to tell me?
144,00:09:51,00:09:56,The man you're looking for no longer exists.
145,00:09:57,00:09:59,"If you'll excuse me, I have some chores to do."
146,00:10:03,00:10:06,You ever been to the Rancho Center Motel?
147,00:10:06,00:10:08,Plenty of times.
148,00:10:08,00:10:14,"With hookers, addicts, drug dealers, pimps, wife beaters, runaways."
149,00:10:14,00:10:16,I save people.
150,00:10:16,00:10:19,You ever save these two?
151,00:10:20,00:10:22,"You know them, don't you?"
152,00:10:24,00:10:26,There's nothing I can tell you.
153,00:10:26,00:10:28,"These people have a daughter, and she's missing."
154,00:10:28,00:10:36,And due to the fact that you're a convicted sex offender that means that you better come up with a lot more than these corny priestly homilies and you better come up with them fast.
155,00:10:36,00:10:37,I don't answer to you.
156,00:10:38,00:10:39,I want to talk to my lawyer.
157,00:10:39,00:10:42,That's a good idea because you're under arrest.
158,00:10:42,00:10:44,"Yo, Rambar, I have some documents to... Sh..."
159,00:10:44,00:10:46,Piece of junk. (slams lid)
160,00:10:46,00:10:47,Where's Rambar?
161,00:10:47,00:10:50,Where all state employees go when they fail repeatedly.
162,00:10:50,00:10:55,FBI Lab? Sucking down taxpayer dollars in Quantico as we speak.
163,00:10:55,00:10:57,"Me, I like to think I'm broadening my horizons."
164,00:10:57,00:10:58,"Yeah, along with your pay grade."
165,00:10:58,00:11:00,"Oh, happy coincidence indeed, sir."
166,00:11:00,00:11:02,What you got here?
167,00:11:02,00:11:03,Wow.
168,00:11:04,00:11:06,Somebody needs to switch to decaf.
169,00:11:06,00:11:08,In there somewhere is a Nevada plate number and a name.
170,00:11:08,00:11:09,Can you dig it out?
171,00:11:09,00:11:11,I could try.
172,00:11:11,00:11:17,"BROWN: The plate number is ""something, something, something, D, seven, something, something."" Okay, well, it's a fairly new model."
173,00:11:17,00:11:21,"The four letter, three number configuration has only been standard a couple years."
174,00:11:25,00:11:26,Ooh.
175,00:11:26,00:11:28,"Well, uh... it's a start."
176,00:11:28,00:11:32,"Well, can you cross-reference these records against the characters in the vics' last name."
177,00:11:32,00:11:39,"It's ""M, A, blank, blank, blank, I, blank, blank."" (computer trills)"
178,00:11:42,00:11:44,Now that's a good start.
179,00:11:52,00:11:55,BROWN: Alvin and Girlie Macalino.
180,00:11:55,00:11:57,Let's do it.
181,00:11:57,00:11:59,"This makes what, the third power outage since summer?"
182,00:11:59,00:12:03,"Fourth, actually. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the city was trying to get rid of us."
183,00:12:03,00:12:06,That's a hundred dollar fine right there.
184,00:12:11,00:12:14,That's not good.
185,00:12:14,00:12:16,BROWN: Las Vegas PD.
186,00:12:16,00:12:18,Is anybody home?
187,00:12:32,00:12:35,It smells metallic.
188,00:13:10,00:13:12,"Oh, man."
189,00:13:12,00:13:13,What the hell is that?
190,00:13:15,00:13:18,That looks like balut.
191,00:13:18,00:13:20,It's this Filipino delicacy.
192,00:13:20,00:13:23,My grandmother's best friend is from Manila.
193,00:13:23,00:13:25,Bet it tastes like chicken.
194,00:13:25,00:13:30,The Macalinos must've been in quite a hurry to leave their dinner out like that.
195,00:13:52,00:13:54,Oh...
196,00:13:56,00:13:58,So much for the daughter.
197,00:14:11,00:14:13,No visible signs of sexual trauma.
198,00:14:13,00:14:15,If it's any consolation.
199,00:14:15,00:14:17,It's not.
200,00:14:20,00:14:23,GRISSOM: Burger Giant to go.
201,00:14:23,00:14:26,They were eating it at the motel and someone had it here.
202,00:14:26,00:14:28,Possible connection?
203,00:14:28,00:14:32,"Hey, maybe we can add robbery to the list."
204,00:14:37,00:14:40,Wi-Fi card but no laptop.
205,00:14:44,00:14:46,"Mom, dad..."
206,00:14:46,00:14:49,andtwogirls.
207,00:14:49,00:14:51,They have another daughter?
208,00:14:51,00:14:54,(muffled buzzing)
209,00:14:57,00:15:00,"Okay, so it's not just the ringing in my ears."
210,00:15:00,00:15:03,(muffled buzzing continues)
211,00:15:23,00:15:25,(ladder clicking)
212,00:15:32,00:15:35,(muffled buzzing continues)
213,00:15:55,00:15:59,"SANDERS: One girl gets My Little Pony, the other one ends up here."
214,00:15:59,00:16:02,"That doesn't seem fair, does it?"
215,00:16:03,00:16:04,(muffled buzzing continues)
216,00:16:04,00:16:07,(insect buzzing)
217,00:16:10,00:16:13,(buzzing continues)
218,00:16:18,00:16:19,(bee buzzing)
219,00:16:25,00:16:27,(buzzing grows louder)
220,00:16:27,00:16:29,Greg?
221,00:16:29,00:16:31,Do you have any allergies?
222,00:16:31,00:16:32,No. Why?
223,00:16:32,00:16:34,Give me a hand.
224,00:16:45,00:16:47,(buzzing grows louder)
225,00:16:58,00:17:01,(bees buzzing loudly)
226,00:17:03,00:17:07,BRASS: The Macalinos had two daughters-- Amy and Elizabeth.
227,00:17:07,00:17:09,"Elizabeth is dead, and Amy is missing."
228,00:17:09,00:17:13,"That is tragic, but it has nothing to do with my client."
229,00:17:13,00:17:16,Your fingerprints were found at the motel where the Macalinos were murdered.
230,00:17:16,00:17:18,My client has already explained that.
231,00:17:18,00:17:24,"Back before you were saving souls, when you were just molesting children, you had a partner..."
232,00:17:24,00:17:26,ATTORNEY: Who died in prison eight years ago.
233,00:17:26,00:17:30,We found male DNA on the bedsheets at the Rancho Center Motel.
234,00:17:30,00:17:33,"You got yourself a new partner, just like old times."
235,00:17:39,00:17:42,"Only, this time, the parents busted in on you."
236,00:17:42,00:17:45,"That was bad for you, but worse for them."
237,00:17:45,00:17:52,"And now that mom and dad are never going to come home, you get yourself a whole new playpen to party in and a new buddy to party with."
238,00:17:52,00:17:55,The DNA at the motel-- was it my client's?
239,00:17:56,00:17:58,No.
240,00:17:58,00:17:59,Then why is he still in custody?
241,00:18:00,00:18:03,Because he's still lying.
242,00:18:03,00:18:06,You're not an ordained minister.
243,00:18:06,00:18:07,You're not a part of any recognized church.
244,00:18:07,00:18:09,You got nothing to hide behind.
245,00:18:09,00:18:17,"So avoid the death penalty-- give us your partner, we get the girl, and you get... redemption."
246,00:18:17,00:18:22,"Six years ago, I was an alcoholic and a crackhead."
247,00:18:22,00:18:25,This man pulled me out of the gutter and saved my life.
248,00:18:25,00:18:26,My firm is doing this pro bono.
249,00:18:26,00:18:30,I guarantee he will not do another day in jail.
250,00:18:30,00:18:34,My partner...
251,00:18:34,00:18:36,is the Lord.
252,00:18:36,00:18:39,"Well, I'm sure it's notHisDNA on those sheets."
253,00:18:41,00:18:47,"LAKE: So anyway, when I graduated I got offers from both the labs in New York and Miami."
254,00:18:47,00:18:49,Know why I picked Vegas?
255,00:18:49,00:18:51,SIDLE: I know you have nine questions left.
256,00:18:51,00:18:53,Crime rate's growing faster here.
257,00:19:04,00:19:10,All of his... um... valuables in a rubber-band wad.
258,00:19:10,00:19:11,No I.D.
259,00:19:11,00:19:12,Check the shirt pocket.
260,00:19:12,00:19:14,I was getting there.
261,00:19:16,00:19:18,Hah.
262,00:19:18,00:19:20,Driver's license. Expired.
263,00:19:20,00:19:24,"Edward Kaye, born 1-28-51."
264,00:19:26,00:19:28,SIDLE: New socks.
265,00:19:28,00:19:30,Happy face sandwich wrapper.
266,00:19:30,00:19:32,It's got to be handouts from a shelter.
267,00:19:32,00:19:34,Make some calls.
268,00:19:34,00:19:36,"You get to ask some questions, Ronnie."
269,00:19:52,00:19:58,"You know, if I had to gauge it by his apartment, I'd say that Alistair Rhodes is a regular guy."
270,00:19:58,00:20:02,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what he wants everybody to think, too."
271,00:20:11,00:20:14,"Hey, Nick."
272,00:20:14,00:20:20,"For a guy with his own flip-down ironing board, these shirts look pretty wrinkled."
273,00:20:57,00:20:59,"Hey, Archie. JOHNSON: Yo."
274,00:20:59,00:21:02,"Whatever you're doing, that's more important."
275,00:21:02,00:21:04,Roman numerals one through six.
276,00:21:04,00:21:05,"All right, let me guess."
277,00:21:05,00:21:06,Star Warsbootlegs.
278,00:21:06,00:21:07,Child pornography.
279,00:21:07,00:21:10,Start with the latest first.
280,00:21:10,00:21:11,Yeah.
281,00:21:16,00:21:18,(tape rewinding)
282,00:21:18,00:21:20,(backward yelling)
283,00:21:30,00:21:31,That's enough. Let it play.
284,00:21:33,00:21:35,(young woman screaming) ...bang you with chains of iron!
285,00:21:35,00:21:37,Come from her now!
286,00:21:39,00:21:40,"Back, Pandemonium!"
287,00:21:41,00:21:43,"Back, Confusion!"
288,00:21:43,00:21:44,Leave...
289,00:21:44,00:21:46,this...
290,00:21:46,00:21:47,Stop it! That's enough!
291,00:21:47,00:21:48,...girl!
292,00:21:48,00:21:51,"MAN: Hey, stop, stop! RHODES: Now, spirit!"
293,00:21:53,00:21:54,WOMAN: Why did you stop him?!
294,00:21:54,00:21:55,He was hurting her! No!
295,00:21:55,00:21:57,This isn't kiddie porn.
296,00:21:57,00:21:59,It's an exorcism.
297,00:21:59,00:22:00,This is your fault.
298,00:22:01,00:22:04,You didn't believe. You didn't believe.
299,00:22:05,00:22:08,He has no knowledge of the deaths or of Amy Macalino's current whereabouts.
300,00:22:08,00:22:10,"BRASS: Counselor, is this your idea of cooperation?"
301,00:22:10,00:22:12,L-Listen to me.
302,00:22:12,00:22:14,Listen to me.
303,00:22:14,00:22:15,The mother came to me...
304,00:22:15,00:22:24,"at her wit's end, heart in her hand, begging me, begging me to free her child."
305,00:22:24,00:22:32,"She said she'd tried doctors and pills, but nothing worked, so I went to the house, I saw it with my own eyes."
306,00:22:41,00:22:42,(growling)
307,00:22:42,00:22:43,"(eerie, distorted): Let..."
308,00:22:43,00:22:44,me...
309,00:22:45,00:22:47,out of here!
310,00:22:47,00:22:49,(distorted screaming)
311,00:22:53,00:22:57,The thing in that house...
312,00:22:57,00:22:58,it wasn't Amy.
313,00:22:58,00:23:01,It wasn't human.
314,00:23:01,00:23:03,I had to cast it out.
315,00:23:03,00:23:04,Did it work?
316,00:23:15,00:23:18,The exorcism-- did it work?
317,00:23:21,00:23:22,No.
318,00:23:24,00:23:33,"Amy's father broke the rules: never speak to it, never interrupt, and believe me completely."
319,00:23:33,00:23:34,Do only as I say.
320,00:23:34,00:23:36,And he didn't believe.
321,00:23:38,00:23:45,"Mr. Grissom, do you believe in a separate, living evil?"
322,00:23:47,00:23:51,You're primitive man on the savannah.
323,00:23:51,00:23:54,You see something move out of the corner of your eye.
324,00:23:54,00:23:56,You assume it's a hyena.
325,00:23:56,00:23:59,"You run, you live."
326,00:23:59,00:24:04,"If you assume it's the wind and you're wrong, you die."
327,00:24:05,00:24:08,We have the genes of the ones who ran.
328,00:24:08,00:24:14,We're genetically hardwired to believe living forces that we cannot see.
329,00:24:14,00:24:19,The Devil's slyest trick is making us believe he isn't real.
330,00:24:21,00:24:24,But call his name loud and long enough...
331,00:24:25,00:24:28,...guess who comes knocking on your door?
332,00:24:29,00:24:30,Usually guys like you.
333,00:24:30,00:24:32,"Look, enough with the Sunday school bull."
334,00:24:32,00:24:34,"This meeting is over, the deal is off."
335,00:24:34,00:24:39,We've answered your questions. I told you the truth.
336,00:24:39,00:24:41,You have to let me leave.
337,00:24:41,00:24:43,He's right about that. If you're not charging him with anything...
338,00:24:43,00:24:45,We're charging you with assault.
339,00:24:45,00:24:48,Fine. We'll make bail. You'll be out of here in six hours.
340,00:24:51,00:24:55,"Multiple contusions on the face, subdural hematomas."
341,00:24:55,00:24:57,This guy was definitely roughed up.
342,00:24:57,00:24:58,C.O.D.?
343,00:24:58,00:25:00,Being homeless in Las Vegas.
344,00:25:00,00:25:02,Cardiac arrest due to dehydration.
345,00:25:02,00:25:04,"Thanks, Doc. Anytime."
346,00:25:04,00:25:06,"Hi, Ronnie. Hi."
347,00:25:06,00:25:09,I faxed the D.B.'s photo to various indigent organizations.
348,00:25:09,00:25:12,Shelter on Rancho and Main I.D.'d him as a regular.
349,00:25:12,00:25:14,Their special this week was socks and sandwiches.
350,00:25:15,00:25:17,Rancho and Main is less than a mile from where we found him.
351,00:25:17,00:25:23,"Bum got into a fight-- business as usual-- and died of exposure, right?"
352,00:25:23,00:25:24,(chuckles)
353,00:25:25,00:25:26,"Oops, that was a question."
354,00:25:26,00:25:30,"I know, I'm down to four, but, I mean, that's it-- case closed, right?"
355,00:25:30,00:25:33,What does that look like to you?
356,00:25:35,00:25:39,"Perimortem abrasions... parallel, double rails."
357,00:25:39,00:25:43,It's handcuffs.
358,00:25:43,00:25:45,Cops must have picked him up before he died.
359,00:25:45,00:25:47,Maybe that's not all they did.
360,00:25:47,00:25:48,"Well, that's a guess."
361,00:25:48,00:25:53,What is the first thing that the police do when they question a suspect?
362,00:25:53,00:25:54,Check for I.D. Standard procedure.
363,00:25:54,00:26:00,Eddie Kaye's only identification was an expired driver's license found separated from all of his worldly possessions.
364,00:26:01,00:26:03,(sighing): Print it.
365,00:26:03,00:26:07,"Well, you're not seriously going to go after the cops over something like this?"
366,00:26:07,00:26:08,You know what?
367,00:26:08,00:26:10,That question I will answer.
368,00:26:10,00:26:13,"We're not here to protect anyone, Ronnie, not even the cops."
369,00:26:13,00:26:16,We're here to figure out what happened.
370,00:26:16,00:26:20,"If you can't do that, you should get a different job."
371,00:26:33,00:26:35,SIDLE: Officer Casella?
372,00:26:35,00:26:36,That's me.
373,00:26:36,00:26:37,"I'm Sara Sidle, I'm with the crime lab."
374,00:26:37,00:26:38,This is my partner Ronnie Lake.
375,00:26:38,00:26:39,Hi.
376,00:26:39,00:26:42,Can you tell me why your fingerprints were found on this?
377,00:26:43,00:26:45,"Well, sure, I touched it."
378,00:26:45,00:26:46,What else did you touch?
379,00:26:48,00:26:49,Uh...
380,00:26:49,00:26:50,"(laughing): I'm sorry, what do you mean?"
381,00:26:50,00:26:52,Did you strike this man?
382,00:26:52,00:26:56,"Okay, are you trying to jam me up? We're not trying to do anything. Where'd you get the bruise, Casella?"
383,00:26:56,00:26:58,I got it doing my job.
384,00:26:58,00:27:03,A couple of train wrecks were slugging it out over this crap sandwich.
385,00:27:03,00:27:10,"I try to save them from themselves, but no good deed goes unpunished, so, uh, one of 'em takes a poke at me."
386,00:27:14,00:27:15,"So I cuff him up, I check his I.D."
387,00:27:15,00:27:19,"I'm ready to run him in, but my partner says to drop it."
388,00:27:19,00:27:27,"Mm-hmm. He says this is an old bum trick, right, like take a swing at a cop, you go to jail where they have A.C., they have food, they have water."
389,00:27:27,00:27:29,I can't believe I almost fell for that.
390,00:27:29,00:27:30,I kind of wish you had.
391,00:27:30,00:27:33,The man died.
392,00:27:58,00:28:00,Wow.
393,00:28:00,00:28:01,"What do you got there, Greg?"
394,00:28:01,00:28:04,.22 handgun.
395,00:28:04,00:28:07,Looks like it could be the murder weapon.
396,00:28:07,00:28:08,You off the clock? Yeah.
397,00:28:08,00:28:09,Good job.
398,00:28:09,00:28:11,Thanks.
399,00:28:11,00:28:12,How you doing?
400,00:28:12,00:28:15,"Well, I've had better days."
401,00:28:15,00:28:16,You missing me yet?
402,00:28:16,00:28:17,A little more every day.
403,00:28:17,00:28:19,Grissom's in the attic.
404,00:28:19,00:28:20,Still.
405,00:28:22,00:28:24,(buzzing)
406,00:28:24,00:28:25,Hey. Hey.
407,00:28:25,00:28:26,Bee frame.
408,00:28:26,00:28:29,"Inside, I've got the queen, the workers, the whole colony."
409,00:28:29,00:28:33,You're looting the crime scene of its bees? I cleared it with Animal Control.
410,00:28:33,00:28:34,This colony is healthy.
411,00:28:34,00:28:37,I need it to study Colony Collapse Disorder.
412,00:28:37,00:28:39,Bees are dying in record numbers everywhere.
413,00:28:39,00:28:45,"You know, I did read that if every bee on Earth died, the human race would follow four years later."
414,00:28:45,00:28:48,"There's no hard evidence to support that, though."
415,00:28:48,00:28:49,Oh.
416,00:28:49,00:28:53,But the world will end... someday.
417,00:29:04,00:29:07,(indistinct radio transmission)
418,00:29:09,00:29:11,You don't think that's cheating?
419,00:29:11,00:29:13,Anybody can get their hands on that stuff.
420,00:29:13,00:29:16,"My kid can get ""the Clear,"" the cream."
421,00:29:16,00:29:22,"Dispatch, we have plate number David-Paul William-Robert- one-eight-four, multiple warrants, parking violations."
422,00:29:22,00:29:25,Maybe we should juice up all the players.
423,00:29:25,00:29:27,"Level the field, be more entertaining for me."
424,00:29:27,00:29:30,"You are one sick twist, my friend, you know that?"
425,00:29:30,00:29:31,(monitor beeps)
426,00:29:31,00:29:32,MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: Stolen vehicle.
427,00:29:32,00:29:33,Hold up.
428,00:29:34,00:29:37,"Dispatch, we have plate number Paul-Robert-Zebra-David- seven-five-zero."
429,00:29:37,00:29:40,"Stolen vehicle, outstanding homicide."
430,00:29:40,00:29:42,"At Koval, off Las Vegas Boulevard."
431,00:29:42,00:29:43,DISPATCHER: Wanted for murder.
432,00:29:43,00:29:45,Back up.
433,00:30:00,00:30:01,"Go, go, go, go!"
434,00:30:01,00:30:04,(tires screeching)
435,00:30:18,00:30:19,"Hands, let me see your hands!"
436,00:30:19,00:30:21,Out of the car now!
437,00:30:21,00:30:23,Get your hands up!
438,00:30:23,00:30:24,Let me see your hands!
439,00:30:24,00:30:26,Get out of the car.
440,00:30:26,00:30:27,Hands!
441,00:30:29,00:30:30,"You know who we're looking for, scumbag-- Amy Macalino."
442,00:30:30,00:30:32,Where is she?
443,00:30:32,00:30:34,I'm Amy.
444,00:30:51,00:30:52,So you're sure you never saw this guy before?
445,00:30:52,00:30:53,That guy?
446,00:30:53,00:30:55,"Uh-uh, no."
447,00:30:56,00:30:59,"Okay, but this guy, uh-huh."
448,00:30:59,00:31:02,"Uh-huh, he was definitely at the Rancho Center Motel."
449,00:31:02,00:31:04,"He was there, um, three nights ago."
450,00:31:04,00:31:07,Had his little camera with him and everything.
451,00:31:07,00:31:09,"Camera? Yeah, like video camera and all that stuff."
452,00:31:09,00:31:11,"That helps, thanks."
453,00:31:11,00:31:12,Thanks for your cooperation.
454,00:31:12,00:31:15,Um... don't I get a reward?
455,00:31:15,00:31:18,"Yeah, you get to leave."
456,00:31:24,00:31:27,"Hi, Amy."
457,00:31:27,00:31:29,"I'm Catherine Willows, I'm with the crime lab."
458,00:31:29,00:31:31,You here to probe me?
459,00:31:31,00:31:34,Swab.
460,00:31:37,00:31:41,"No, no, Amy, this, this is, um, this is in the mouth."
461,00:31:48,00:31:53,Staff tells me that you've already gone through the S.A.E. kit.
462,00:31:54,00:31:56,They tell you I'm all banged up inside?
463,00:31:57,00:32:00,Not in those words.
464,00:32:04,00:32:08,Amy... the man that took you...
465,00:32:09,00:32:11,...he cannot hurt you again.
466,00:32:11,00:32:13,We've got him.
467,00:32:13,00:32:14,Then can I go?
468,00:32:14,00:32:15,W-W-Where's my clothes?
469,00:32:15,00:32:19,"Well, they're evidence for now, but you'll get them back."
470,00:32:23,00:32:28,The clothes that you wore-- were they yours or...
471,00:32:28,00:32:29,did he make you wear them?
472,00:32:33,00:32:36,He made me do a lot of things.
473,00:32:37,00:32:38,BRASS: Andrew Wolflynn.
474,00:32:38,00:32:40,"Bet your friends call you Wolf, huh?"
475,00:32:40,00:32:43,So I'm going to call you Wolf.
476,00:32:43,00:32:45,You can call me Jim.
477,00:32:45,00:32:47,"You know, it's really exciting to meet such a hyphenate."
478,00:32:47,00:32:48,You know what I mean?
479,00:32:48,00:32:49,"I mean, you're a triple threat."
480,00:32:50,00:32:54,"You know, kidnapper- rapist-auteur."
481,00:32:54,00:32:57,Do you like making movies?
482,00:32:57,00:32:58,What are you talking about?
483,00:32:58,00:32:59,Kiddie porn.
484,00:32:59,00:33:01,No.
485,00:33:01,00:33:03,"No, n-no, no way, no-not me, man."
486,00:33:03,00:33:05,"No, not just you-- you and a partner."
487,00:33:07,00:33:09,"He shoots, you score."
488,00:33:09,00:33:11,(crying)
489,00:33:12,00:33:13,It must be a really good business.
490,00:33:13,00:33:16,"Low budget, high profits."
491,00:33:16,00:33:19,Unless you get caught.
492,00:33:25,00:33:27,I've contacted Child Services.
493,00:33:27,00:33:31,You'll have to stay there for at least tonight.
494,00:33:33,00:33:35,Do you have any relatives?
495,00:33:36,00:33:38,Not anymore.
496,00:33:42,00:33:44,I've got a daughter.
497,00:33:44,00:33:48,She's almost your age.
498,00:33:48,00:33:50,Maybe we should hang out.
499,00:33:52,00:33:57,There'll be some counselors there that you can talk to and...
500,00:33:58,00:34:00,...take as much time as you need and...
501,00:34:01,00:34:04,"whenever you're ready, to go back to school."
502,00:34:04,00:34:06,Where do you go?
503,00:34:06,00:34:08,Jefferson.
504,00:34:08,00:34:10,Jefferson High?
505,00:34:10,00:34:11,I don't know that one.
506,00:34:11,00:34:12,Jefferson Middle.
507,00:34:13,00:34:17,"Amy, what grade are you in?"
508,00:34:17,00:34:19,Sixth.
509,00:34:19,00:34:21,I'm 12.
510,00:34:25,00:34:28,"We got your fingerprints, your semen."
511,00:34:28,00:34:32,"I mean, we got you in the dead couple's car working to bang their kidnapped daughter."
512,00:34:32,00:34:34,We got... did I leave anything out?
513,00:34:34,00:34:36,"Oh, yeah, we got your gun."
514,00:34:37,00:34:38,I don't own a gun.
515,00:34:39,00:34:41,"No, you know, we checked the serial number."
516,00:34:41,00:34:42,It belongs to your grandmother.
517,00:34:42,00:34:44,(chuckling): But you know...
518,00:34:44,00:34:48,"And you know, it must be really hard to get that gun off ol' granny."
519,00:34:48,00:34:49,What the hell are you doing?
520,00:34:49,00:34:50,I'm just checking your shirt size.
521,00:34:50,00:34:52,I might want to give you a Christmas present.
522,00:34:52,00:34:54,"17 1/2, 36."
523,00:34:54,00:34:55,You know what?
524,00:34:55,00:34:58,"I was leaving something out, Wolf."
525,00:34:59,00:35:05,We got your shirt soaked not in one but both of the victims' blood.
526,00:35:05,00:35:07,"You see, this is what we call a slam dunk."
527,00:35:08,00:35:09,You're going to jail.
528,00:35:09,00:35:10,You're going to do time.
529,00:35:11,00:35:12,But why do it alone?
530,00:35:13,00:35:15,Don't be a patsy.
531,00:35:15,00:35:18,Just tell us the name of your partner.
532,00:35:18,00:35:19,"Come on, share with a friend."
533,00:35:19,00:35:21,And you know what?
534,00:35:21,00:35:22,You don't even have to tell me his name.
535,00:35:22,00:35:25,All you have to do... is point.
536,00:35:26,00:35:29,Hmm?
537,00:35:29,00:35:31,I've never seen that guy before in my life.
538,00:35:31,00:35:33,"Come on, you can do better than that."
539,00:35:33,00:35:35,I want a lawyer.
540,00:36:11,00:36:13,What are you doing?
541,00:36:13,00:36:14,Hey.
542,00:36:14,00:36:18,I'm trying to make some sense out of the spatter.
543,00:36:18,00:36:20,"Now, we've already determined that the..."
544,00:36:20,00:36:29,"the killer rolled up his sleeves when he murdered the motel victims, but when I found the shirt, the cuffs were buttoned, and I'm not much bigger than this guy."
545,00:36:29,00:36:31,And look.
546,00:36:31,00:36:33,This is as far as the sleeves go up.
547,00:36:35,00:36:37,Would you give me the shirt off your back?
548,00:36:37,00:36:40,Sure.
549,00:36:41,00:36:44,(quietly): Here you go.
550,00:36:48,00:36:51,Okay.
551,00:36:56,00:36:58,Easy.
552,00:36:58,00:37:01,"So Wolflynn wasn't wearing the shirt, was he?"
553,00:37:01,00:37:04,I guess Amy was.
554,00:37:04,00:37:05,A trophy after sex.
555,00:37:05,00:37:08,Hey.
556,00:37:08,00:37:11,I have something I'd like you to see.
557,00:37:11,00:37:15,The Macalino family computer was recovered from the stolen car.
558,00:37:15,00:37:16,Archie...
559,00:37:16,00:37:19,found the chat logs.
560,00:37:19,00:37:23,"A lot of traffic between Amy and the ""Wolfman."" Keep reading."
561,00:37:31,00:37:33,It looks like Amy's luring the Wolfman.
562,00:37:33,00:37:36,What would you do if you found this on Lindsey's computer?
563,00:37:36,00:37:37,WILLOWS: Ground her for life.
564,00:37:38,00:37:41,Take the laptop.
565,00:37:41,00:37:45,"Lock her in the attic, maybe?"
566,00:37:45,00:37:48,"Well, you push kids, they push back."
567,00:37:48,00:37:49,Things can get out of hand pretty quick.
568,00:37:49,00:37:52,The Macalinos were pushed all the way to an exorcism.
569,00:37:53,00:37:58,"Now, Alistair Rhodes says that he left the motel when his ritual failed."
570,00:37:58,00:38:01,The video shows the father tried to stop it.
571,00:38:02,00:38:04,He probably untied her.
572,00:38:04,00:38:05,Right?
573,00:38:05,00:38:11,"So Amy escapes, she goes and gets her knight in shining armor."
574,00:38:11,00:38:13,"Yeah, Wolf and his .22 caliber."
575,00:38:13,00:38:15,They return to the motel.
576,00:38:15,00:38:19,"The parents are gone, but the room's still paid for."
577,00:38:19,00:38:22,They have sex and burgers.
578,00:38:22,00:38:27,"And Amy calls her mom and dad, who come back because they still love her."
579,00:38:27,00:38:39,"Dad gets killed first... quick, but mom, the true believer, the one who wanted to drive out the demons, she has to suffer."
580,00:38:42,00:38:44,And Amy goes home to get her computer...
581,00:38:46,00:38:49,...and kills her little sister.
582,00:38:49,00:38:50,I'll call Brass.
583,00:38:50,00:38:52,We'll go pick Amy up.
584,00:39:06,00:39:08,(knocking)
585,00:39:09,00:39:11,"Amy, there's somebody here to see you."
586,00:39:11,00:39:14,"Could you come with me, please?"
587,00:39:23,00:39:25,Just wait in here.
588,00:39:45,00:39:48,WILLOWS: We need to see Amy Macalino.
589,00:39:48,00:39:50,Popular girl tonight.
590,00:39:51,00:39:52,She's upstairs with her minister.
591,00:39:52,00:39:54,(cocks gun) Her what?
592,00:39:55,00:39:57,"Control, this is Willows."
593,00:39:57,00:39:58,I'm at C.P.S.
594,00:39:58,00:39:59,I need backup.
595,00:39:59,00:40:01,Code Three now. (Amy screaming)
596,00:40:01,00:40:04,(Amy screams)
597,00:40:05,00:40:08,(thud)
598,00:40:08,00:40:09,(gasps)
599,00:40:10,00:40:11,"Alistair, turn around."
600,00:40:11,00:40:12,Turn around.
601,00:40:12,00:40:14,Now!
602,00:40:14,00:40:17,Get down on your knees.
603,00:40:21,00:40:23,I saved her.
604,00:40:25,00:40:27,I saved her.
