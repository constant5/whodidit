0	00:00:49	00:00:51	Feel like getting high?
1	00:00:51	00:00:53	Do I have to?
2	00:00:55	00:00:56	Hey, this is Stokes.
3	00:00:56	00:00:59	I need a lift to Convention Center Drive.
4	00:00:59	00:01:02	Looks like somebody had some late-night target practice.
5	00:01:04	00:01:05	Three Boy Does.
6	00:01:05	00:01:06	No I.D.s.
7	00:01:06	00:01:09	Nobody saw anything.
8	00:01:09	00:01:11	Nine-millimeter shells all over the place.
9	00:01:12	00:01:13	That's a lot of racket. Somebody heard something.
10	00:01:14	00:01:17	Only ones who did thought it was the fireworks show at the Wynn.
11	00:01:17	00:01:19	Good luck.
12	00:01:31	00:01:32	What do you think?
13	00:01:32	00:01:38	3 Shot through a Flavor Flav clock.
14	00:01:38	00:01:40	Haven't seen one of these since high school.
15	00:01:40	00:01:42	Old school's the new school.
16	00:01:57	00:01:58	So, what do you think?
17	00:01:58	00:01:59	This has got to be a gang war, huh?
18	00:01:59	00:02:01	Well, if it's a gang war...
19	00:02:02	00:02:04	these kids were outgunned.
20	00:02:42	00:02:43	No personal effects!
21	00:02:43	00:02:45	No keys, no I.D.!
22	00:02:45	00:02:46	Nothing!
23	00:02:46	00:02:49	Either these kids were traveling light, or they were robbed blind.
24	00:02:49	00:02:51	And who the hell would rob them up there?
25	00:02:51	00:02:53	Andre the Giant?
26	00:02:56	00:03:00	Hey, Doc, is it just me, or did something crush his legs?
27	00:03:00	00:03:03	Well, first off...
28	00:03:05	00:03:10	...looks like he is a she, and something crushed her legs.
29	00:03:18	00:03:20	What do you think this is?
30	00:03:20	00:03:22	That's your job.
31	00:03:22	00:03:24	Yeah.
32	00:03:25	00:03:30	Well... I did find casings in such a wide distribution...
33	00:03:30	00:03:35	and a lot of them were flattened, so it suggests to me that the killer was moving when he was shooting.
34	00:03:40	00:03:41	Drive-by?
35	00:03:41	00:03:43	Yeah, with a hit-and-run chaser.
36	00:03:53	00:03:53	What up, country?
37	00:03:54	00:03:56	So, the bullet is practically smooth.
38	00:03:56	00:03:58	I mean, no sharp-edged rifling marks.
39	00:03:58	00:04:01	Which means it was probably fired from a polygonal barrel.
40	00:04:01	00:04:02	Did you run cartridge casings yet?
41	00:04:02	00:04:05	Yeah, yeah, and got an IBIS hit off of a firing pin impression.
42	00:04:05	00:04:09	Murder weapon is an H&amp;K MP-5.
43	00:04:09	00:04:11	That's a $2,500 firearm.
44	00:04:11	00:04:13	That's not your typical street piece.
45	00:04:13	00:04:15	Yeah. It registered to LVPD.
46	00:04:15	00:04:16	Really? Yeah.
47	00:04:16	00:04:22	Those babies are very popular with law enforcement, and that one is issued to SWAT...
48	00:04:22	00:04:28	and reported stolen during a drug raid on Vegas Valley and Sandhill...
49	00:04:28	00:04:30	six months ago.
50	00:05:03	00:05:07	Hodges, you getting anywhere with that steel rod we found?
51	00:05:07	00:05:11	Your steel rod is part of a custom hydraulic cylinder.
52	00:05:11	00:05:13	Size and shape is a match for a brand called Red's.
53	00:05:13	00:05:15	Oh, this guy was driving a street hopper.
54	00:05:15	00:05:17	Low-riders get little clearance...
55	00:05:19	00:05:23	I'm sure he was more busted up about his ride being damaged than the three kids he whacked.
56	00:05:23	00:05:28	Hmm. Also found paint traces on the rod.
57	00:05:28	00:05:33	Color is Chesapeake Blue Pearl.
58	00:05:33	00:05:34	It's from a Dupont line called Brilliantz.
59	00:05:34	00:05:36	Mostly used on show vehicles.
60	00:05:36	00:05:38	Red's auto parts are individually serialized.
61	00:05:38	00:05:41	Shouldn't be too hard to find out where it was sold.
62	00:05:41	00:05:42	Cool.
63	00:05:42	00:05:44	A'ight, G, so...
64	00:05:44	00:05:46	Don't make me shoot you.
65	00:05:46	00:05:48	Crime Scene Investigation.
66	00:05:48	00:05:50	Hell, I love a bloody scene...
67	00:05:50	00:05:52	DNA and all that.
68	00:05:52	00:05:55	Look, you give me a serial number, I can definitely figure out who bought it.
69	00:05:55	00:05:57	Yeah, yeah, here you go.
70	00:05:57	00:05:58	A'ight.
71	00:06:00	00:06:03	This is the old style cylinder.
72	00:06:03	00:06:04	Give me a second.
73	00:06:12	00:06:16	Yeah, man, this, uh... serial's not showing up.
74	00:06:16	00:06:17	You said definitely.
75	00:06:17	00:06:20	Yeah, but these old serial numbers sometimes get erased from the system.
76	00:06:20	00:06:21	I mean, it's happened, you know?
77	00:06:21	00:06:23	Sounds like the wrong name might've just popped up.
78	00:06:23	00:06:25	No name popped up.
79	00:06:25	00:06:26	What's the matter, man?
80	00:06:26	00:06:29	You worried about having some hard times if you give your homey's name up? I'll get a warrant.
81	00:06:29	00:06:32	You don't mind taking a break for a while, sitting on the curb while we get some cops up in here.
82	00:06:32	00:06:35	Look, man, I don't need that kind of a scene around here.
83	00:06:35	00:06:36	How 'bout we do this?
84	00:06:36	00:06:41	How 'bout you let us muscle you off your computer, and we can get the information ourselves?
85	00:06:41	00:06:44	That way, if you're ever asked, you can say there was nothing you could do.
86	00:06:44	00:06:46	You can let us do our jobs, and we'll be out of your hair.
87	00:06:49	00:06:51	I can live with that.
88	00:06:52	00:06:53	Good man.
89	00:07:00	00:07:05	Jeremiah Calvin. 59391 Sandhill.
90	00:07:06	00:07:10	That's the same part of town where the SWAT cop lost his gun.
91	00:07:14	00:07:18	How long ago did I call for backup?
92	00:07:18	00:07:21	About 15 minutes.
93	00:07:24	00:07:27	Dispatch, this is unit 3D7.
94	00:07:27	00:07:32	We are 465 at 59391 Sandhill.
95	00:07:32	00:07:33	ETA on that backup?
96	00:07:33	00:07:37	Unit 3D7, ETA approximately five minutes.
97	00:07:37	00:07:40	Copy that. We'll sit tight.
98	00:07:40	00:07:43	Hello. There's our gangster ride right there.
99	00:07:43	00:07:44	With a gangster in it.
100	00:07:44	00:07:46	Yep.
101	00:07:46	00:07:48	Look at that.
102	00:07:53	00:07:57	He saw us. I think I'll go get him now, man, before I lose that boy.
103	00:07:57	00:07:59	Go for it, go for it.
104	00:07:59	00:08:02	Dispatch, this is unit 3D7.
105	00:08:02	00:08:04	Suspect is on the move.
106	00:08:04	00:08:10	It's a, uh, royal blue Chevy Impala northbound on Valley View Drive.
107	00:08:10	00:08:13	License 4-2-3- Nora-Queen-John.
108	00:08:13	00:08:14	Northbound.
109	00:08:14	00:08:15	Copy that.
110	00:08:15	00:08:17	I'll inform the backup.
111	00:08:21	00:08:24	Dispatch, westbound Hatteras.
112	00:08:24	00:08:27	Westbound Hatteras.
113	00:08:35	00:08:37	Northbound Sequoia.
114	00:08:37	00:08:39	Dispatch, northbound Sequoia.
115	00:08:44	00:08:46	Dispatch, uh, this is unit 3D7.
116	00:08:46	00:08:50	Suspect has pulled into an alley on the 7700 block on Eastern.
117	00:08:50	00:08:51	Requesting backup.
118	00:08:51	00:08:53	We've got two on the way.
119	00:08:53	00:08:55	They're stuck behind a TC on Maryland Parkway.
120	00:08:57	00:08:58	Hey, what are you doing?
121	00:08:58	00:09:00	I told you little punk... airport cops to stop riding me, man.
122	00:09:00	00:09:01	Son, get back in the car.
123	00:09:01	00:09:03	You get out the car!
124	00:09:03	00:09:05	All this old Crime Scene stuff followin' me, man.
125	00:09:05	00:09:06	Y'all think you're all cops? Y'all ain't cops.
126	00:09:07	00:09:08	That's right, we're not cops.
127	00:09:08	00:09:09	We're mad scientists.
128	00:09:09	00:09:12	Back away from the vehicle and let me see your hands right now.
129	00:09:12	00:09:13	Dispatch, we got a code three.
130	00:09:13	00:09:15	Hey, hold on, man, you calling for backup?
131	00:09:15	00:09:16	Your backup or my backup?
132	00:09:17	00:09:19	Son, you trying to win the wet tee shirt contest?
133	00:09:19	00:09:23	My partner here's a great shot. Yeah, you're real cute with that gun, too.
134	00:09:23	00:09:24	I'm not going to tell you again.
135	00:09:24	00:09:28	You know what, man? I've had so many damn guns pointed at my face, I feel right at home looking at yours.
136	00:09:28	00:09:29	Let me see your hands.
137	00:09:29	00:09:30	How you know I won't shoot your man?
138	00:09:30	00:09:34	Huh? How you know I ain't got something at my waist pointed at your man right now?
139	00:09:34	00:09:37	You know, hollow points'll go right through the door.
140	00:09:41	00:09:42	You want to shoot me, huh?
141	00:09:44	00:09:45	Whoa, whoa, hey, right here.
142	00:09:45	00:09:46	He was reaching for something.
143	00:09:47	00:09:49	Check him for weapons, Mitch.
144	00:09:51	00:09:52	It's cool. He's clean.
145	00:09:52	00:09:53	He's clean?
146	00:09:53	00:09:55	I don't need no gun for you!
147	00:09:56	00:09:57	Just be cool.
148	00:09:57	00:10:01	Come on, Just be cool, just be cool.
149	00:10:02	00:10:05	I'm telling you, man, I'm ready to file a complaint right now.
150	00:10:06	00:10:08	And that not-a-cop better be lucky I ain't suing his ass.
151	00:10:08	00:10:10	Maybe I will.
152	00:10:10	00:10:12	Look, man, I wasn't even doing nothing.
153	00:10:12	00:10:13	Hey. All I did was ask him...
154	00:10:13	00:10:14	How'd things go with Ecklie?
155	00:10:14	00:10:16	Not good.
156	00:10:16	00:10:17	I wasn't speeding...
157	00:10:17	00:10:19	Don't worry. I'll go and talk to him.
158	00:10:19	00:10:22	No, don't talk to him.
159	00:10:22	00:10:27	You want to tell me what your car was doing at the scene of a triple homicide two nights ago?
160	00:10:28	00:10:29	Wait, hold up, h-hold up, man.
161	00:10:29	00:10:30	Let's get this straight.
162	00:10:30	00:10:32	I don't own a car.
163	00:10:32	00:10:34	You can check the papers.
164	00:10:34	00:10:35	That's my Grandpa's ride.
165	00:10:35	00:10:37	So you borrowed it two nights ago?
166	00:10:37	00:10:38	No, I didn't.
167	00:10:38	00:10:39	I was working, man.
168	00:10:39	00:10:41	I deejay over at O.G.
169	00:10:41	00:10:50	If you don't believe me, you could ask Jeni, and Rocker Jules, and GG, and Lina, and Blaze.
170	00:10:50	00:10:51	You know, I had my first five-some that night.
171	00:10:52	00:10:54	And there wasn't no homicides goin' down.
172	00:10:54	00:10:56	You could believe that.
173	00:10:56	00:10:58	I'm happy for you, man.
174	00:10:58	00:11:01	So, what, are you pinning this rap on Grandpa?
175	00:11:01	00:11:04	Yo, man, my grandpa was a gangster back in the day.
176	00:11:04	00:11:05	You'd be surprised.
177	00:11:05	00:11:08	Yeah, I'm really not surprised by much anymore.
178	00:11:08	00:11:11	We have a warrant to search your house...
179	00:11:11	00:11:13	and I bet I find a crime to go with every gun.
180	00:11:13	00:11:17	If I'd killed those kids...
181	00:11:17	00:11:20	you would never find a gun.
182	00:11:26	00:11:27	Las Vegas Police.
183	00:11:27	00:11:29	We have a warrant to search the premises.
184	00:11:29	00:11:32	Come on in.
185	00:11:40	00:11:42	Costs money to fix a door.
186	00:11:42	00:11:43	Thanks for knocking.
187	00:11:50	00:11:51	Clear.
188	00:11:51	00:11:52	Got any guns in the house, sir?
189	00:11:52	00:11:54	I don't allow that garbage in here.
190	00:11:54	00:11:55	Where's Jeremiah's room?
191	00:11:55	00:11:56	End of the hall.
192	00:12:01	00:12:03	Got nothing.
193	00:12:08	00:12:12	I'm going to need you to verify the whereabouts of your grandson Jeremiah two nights ago.
194	00:12:12	00:12:13	How the hell would I know?
195	00:12:13	00:12:14	Man, you're making me miss my program.
196	00:12:14	00:12:16	It's not like I got that TiVo.
197	00:12:16	00:12:17	Mr. Calvin?
198	00:12:17	00:12:18	Whose room is next to Jeremiah's?
199	00:12:19	00:12:21	Morris'. Did Morris ever drive the car?
200	00:12:21	00:12:23	Go ask him. Where is he?
201	00:12:23	00:12:25	He wasn't in his room? He's been in there all day.
202	00:12:25	00:12:27	Morris?
203	00:12:29	00:12:31	Morris?
204	00:12:39	00:12:41	Control, this is CSI Willows.
205	00:12:41	00:12:43	We need an ambulance.
206	00:12:43	00:12:46	Hey, Morris, somebody's coming for you.
207	00:12:49	00:12:53	He doesn't have a bad attitude, he has Clostridium tetani.
208	00:12:53	00:12:54	Tetanus.
209	00:12:54	00:12:58	I extracted this from the wound in his calf.
210	00:13:00	00:13:04	Bacteria on the stable got into the bloodstream releasing toxins that enabled muscular contractions.
211	00:13:04	00:13:08	That's why they call it lockjaw.
212	00:13:08	00:13:09	No wonder he wouldn't talk-- he couldn't.
213	00:13:09	00:13:11	How long before he can?
214	00:13:11	00:13:16	Take couple of days for the antibiotics to flush it out of his system.
215	00:13:19	00:13:20	Well, he doesn't have lock-wrist.
216	00:13:20	00:13:21	You got a pen?
217	00:13:27	00:13:34	We match your blood to the staple gun, it puts you at Convention Center Drive and you go down for three murders.
218	00:13:35	00:13:40	You have anything to tell us, now's the time.
219	00:15:13	00:15:16	Hey, so the car was definitely at the scene.
220	00:15:16	00:15:21	Blood on the soft-top was a match to one of the vics.
221	00:15:21	00:15:23	And Morris Calvin was there.
222	00:15:23	00:15:26	DNA confirmed that it was his blood on the staple gun.
223	00:15:38	00:15:42	Yeah, but we don't have a murder weapon so we can't confirm Morris was the shooter.
224	00:15:42	00:15:44	There's a ton of unknown prints on the car.
225	00:15:44	00:15:45	GSR in the backseat.
226	00:15:45	00:15:47	Had to be other people involved.
227	00:15:47	00:15:50	If we could ID the vics, it might tell us who'd want them dead.
228	00:15:50	00:15:56	Standard procedure for a drive-by is shoot as much as you can as fast as you can, right?
229	00:15:56	00:15:57	Then leave as fast as you can.
230	00:15:57	00:16:01	So why did Morris get out of the car?
231	00:16:01	00:16:03	Maybe the vics had something he wanted.
232	00:16:03	00:16:06	The only thing the victims on the ground had on them were the clothes on their back.
233	00:16:06	00:16:09	And the kid in the palm tree, empty satchel.
234	00:16:09	00:16:12	Vega ran the vics' past the guys in the Gang Unit.
235	00:16:12	00:16:14	Nobody recognized them.
236	00:16:14	00:16:17	And tox panels on them all came back negative.
237	00:16:17	00:16:20	There were no drugs in their system, no personal effects.
238	00:16:20	00:16:21	I doubt they were even packing.
239	00:16:22	00:16:23	They were packing posters.
240	00:16:23	00:16:26	Are you suggesting that they were killed for their posters?
241	00:16:26	00:16:29	Maybe for what was on them.
242	00:16:29	00:16:33	All right, now wait a minute, Grissom, there were posters all over that street.
243	00:16:33	00:16:36	Man, we have no way of knowing which posters they put up.
244	00:16:36	00:16:38	Well, you got the staple gun.
245	00:16:38	00:16:40	Figure out what they stapled.
246	00:18:09	00:18:10	Hey, slick.
247	00:18:11	00:18:14	I saw my P.O. yesterday, guys, so you can just go home.
248	00:18:15	00:18:18	Parole officer didn't bring us here, cousin.
249	00:18:18	00:18:19	A poster did.
250	00:18:19	00:18:25	If you're trying to stick me with some kind of child porno thing or something sick like that, I'm not your guy.
251	00:18:25	00:18:29	I do mainly concerts and conventions and have for the past 20 years.
252	00:18:29	00:18:31	I'm cheap, fast, and open 24/7.
253	00:18:31	00:18:34	Just like my ex-wife.
254	00:18:34	00:18:36	You have any idea where this came from?
255	00:18:39	00:18:41	You know, maybe.
256	00:18:42	00:18:45	The wall of fame.
257	00:18:45	00:18:49	This is where my customers can appreciate my work.
258	00:18:49	00:18:51	Let's see here.
259	00:18:51	00:18:54	Yeah, now this is a classic.
260	00:18:54	00:19:01	Now I know about Chicks Gone Nutz because of their booby videos but Dudes Gone Nutz now... ( chuckles )
261	00:19:01	00:19:02	that really busts my belt.
262	00:19:02	00:19:04	You know, wait a second...
263	00:19:04	00:19:06	I think I've seen that guy before.
264	00:19:06	00:19:07	It's Dollar. He's a rapper.
265	00:19:07	00:19:08	No kidding.
266	00:19:08	00:19:10	Those dudes are nuts.
267	00:19:10	00:19:13	Yeah, well, everybody goes nuts.
268	00:19:13	00:19:15	Any idea who ordered up the poster?
269	00:19:15	00:19:17	Skinny little black kid, day before yesterday.
270	00:19:17	00:19:19	One of these?
271	00:19:21	00:19:24	Oh...
272	00:19:24	00:19:25	Man. That's too bad.
273	00:19:25	00:19:27	Yeah, there he is.
274	00:19:27	00:19:28	How did he pay?
275	00:19:28	00:19:30	Wad of cash.
276	00:19:30	00:19:32	Interframe artifacts.
277	00:19:32	00:19:36	It's a still frame from a video.
278	00:19:36	00:19:40	I'm afraid we're going to deplete your wall of fame-- that posters coming with us.
279	00:19:44	00:19:45	I did a search on Dollar.
280	00:19:45	00:19:47	His real name is Jessie Cleveland.
281	00:19:47	00:19:50	Vegas street kid made good, first CD went platinum.
282	00:19:51	00:19:53	Brass is contacting his managers.
283	00:19:53	00:19:54	Here he is.
284	00:19:54	00:19:58	I'm guessing this is not his next album cover.
285	00:19:58	00:20:00	I hope not.
286	00:20:00	00:20:05	So when I went online, I found the usual things...
287	00:20:05	00:20:08	websites, photos, and this...
288	00:20:10	00:20:18	Playa, look, dawg, you know what I'm saying, I got stacks of cash in the back, man, I got jewelry, I got Black American Express cards.
289	00:20:18	00:20:19	I got whatever you want, man, take it all, dawg.
290	00:20:19	00:20:25	Put your face in the bed, your ass in the air, and say what I want you to say.
291	00:20:26	00:20:29	I'm Dollar...
292	00:20:29	00:20:34	from Dudes Gone Nutz and I liked it...
293	00:20:37	00:20:38	I like to take it...
294	00:20:38	00:20:41	Video was mirrored on a dozen rap sites.
295	00:20:41	00:20:42	It's all over the net.
296	00:20:42	00:20:43	This ain't right, dawg.
297	00:20:44	00:20:45	So this is a rap thing?
298	00:20:45	00:20:47	Biggie and Tupac?
299	00:20:47	00:20:48	Who's the bitch now?
300	00:20:48	00:20:51	You got it, dawg.
301	00:20:51	00:20:53	If these guys would shoot somebody over lyrics, they'd definitely kill over this.
302	00:20:53	00:20:55	Yeah.
303	00:20:57	00:21:01	Mr. Dollar left strict instructions not to be disturbed.
304	00:21:01	00:21:05	Well, that's too bad 'cause we're conducing a murder investigation.
305	00:21:07	00:21:09	Las Vegas Police.
306	00:21:09	00:21:12	Open up.
307	00:21:13	00:21:15	So what are you waiting for?
308	00:21:19	00:21:20	Thank you.
309	00:21:34	00:21:36	Hey, Jim, check it out.
310	00:21:37	00:21:38	Hitting on 21.
311	00:21:38	00:21:40	Looks a lot different, doesn't he, all pimped out?
312	00:21:40	00:21:42	Yeah. Don't kid yourself.
313	00:21:42	00:21:43	He's getting pimped in that video.
314	00:21:44	00:21:49	Excuse me, but if Mr. Dollar's not here, you're going to have to leave.
315	00:21:49	00:21:51	We haven't even checked under the bed yet.
316	00:21:51	00:21:55	Yeah, and what's with all the boxes, clothes?
317	00:21:55	00:21:56	It's MAGIC.
318	00:21:56	00:21:59	You know, for a concierge, you're not really very helpful.
319	00:21:59	00:22:00	It's a convention, sir.
320	00:22:00	00:22:03	MAGIC-- Men's Apparel Guild In California.
321	00:22:03	00:22:05	It's the largest fashion show in the world.
322	00:22:05	00:22:06	With every rapper, there's a clothing line.
323	00:22:06	00:22:08	They all come to MAGIC to promote it.
324	00:22:08	00:22:10	Biggest party in town.
325	00:22:10	00:22:11	Hmm.
326	00:22:11	00:22:13	So what kind of car did he drive?
327	00:22:13	00:22:17	Um, sir, his vehicle's still in valet.
328	00:22:20	00:22:22	There it is right there.
329	00:22:22	00:22:24	Yeah, is that it?
330	00:22:24	00:22:26	It's the only one with 22-inch rims; it's got to be.
331	00:22:31	00:22:32	What's that?
332	00:22:32	00:22:33	Open this up.
333	00:22:48	00:22:51	Where we at, man?
334	00:22:51	00:22:53	You're outside your hotel, sir.
335	00:22:53	00:22:55	Don't worry, we're gonna get you out of there and get you medical attention.
336	00:22:56	00:22:58	Man, is you crazy? Look what I got on.
337	00:22:58	00:23:02	I got all these people around here, the press.
338	00:23:02	00:23:04	Man, let me know when we get to the hospital, man.
339	00:23:06	00:23:08	He's got a point.
340	00:23:09	00:23:12	My prints? The hell you want my prints for?
341	00:23:12	00:23:15	I'm the guy that was forced to wear the bikini, remember?
342	00:23:15	00:23:18	I was in a trunk. I was in two trunks.
343	00:23:18	00:23:20	Three teenagers were killed on Convention Center Drive.
344	00:23:20	00:23:22	They were shot down putting up posters of you.
345	00:23:22	00:23:25	Man, there's posters of me all over town.
346	00:23:25	00:23:26	Got a record coming out.
347	00:23:26	00:23:28	I know. I like the album cover.
348	00:23:30	00:23:32	Where'd you get that?
349	00:23:32	00:23:34	Like you said, they're all over town.
350	00:23:34	00:23:37	We need your prints so that we may exclude you as a suspect.
351	00:23:37	00:23:39	Yeah, right.
352	00:23:39	00:23:41	Go ahead, take my prints.
353	00:23:41	00:23:43	So what's the story with the video?
354	00:23:43	00:23:46	Man, I left the Sean John party, swerving.
355	00:23:46	00:23:50	Big bubble butt on one hand, bottle in the other.
356	00:23:50	00:23:53	Went back to the room and I passed out before I could even get my lay on.
357	00:23:54	00:23:57	When I woke up, I had a gun and a video camera shoved in my face.
358	00:23:57	00:23:59	Y'all know where that ended up.
359	00:23:59	00:24:02	Next thing I know, I'm in my luggage with a fat-ass lip.
360	00:24:02	00:24:03	What'd the guy look like?
361	00:24:03	00:24:06	I don't know. He had on a mask.
362	00:24:06	00:24:07	Anyone following you at the time?
363	00:24:07	00:24:11	Man, I was so blunted and liquored up, I have no idea.
364	00:24:12	00:24:14	Yo.
365	00:24:14	00:24:18	Listen, man, y'all find out who did this for me, like, I'm telling you, like, I'll take care of you.
366	00:24:18	00:24:20	I'll give you a whole new closet full of suits.
367	00:24:20	00:24:21	Like, whatever you want.
368	00:24:21	00:24:23	Like, you'll be popping tags for over a year.
369	00:24:23	00:24:26	Like, you'll be the freshest cops on the street, I swear.
370	00:24:26	00:24:28	Why would somebody want to do this to you?
371	00:24:28	00:24:29	Man, why wouldn't they?
372	00:24:29	00:24:33	I've been dealing with beef like this my entire life, you dig?
373	00:24:33	00:24:37	I bought my first bulletproof vest when I was 15 years old, and I wore it to school.
374	00:24:37	00:24:40	Them putting me in that bikini, man, that poster ain't nothing, man.
375	00:24:40	00:24:42	I'm lucky to be alive.
376	00:24:42	00:24:46	Okay, look, why Dudes Gone Nutz?
377	00:24:46	00:24:47	I don't know, man.
378	00:24:47	00:24:51	I did some guest spots on the little Chicks Gone Nutz video.
379	00:24:51	00:24:53	You know, the girls flash their thing things.
380	00:24:53	00:24:55	Dudes just jealous, man.
381	00:24:55	00:24:57	I dodge haters for a living.
382	00:24:57	00:24:59	I got more enemies than some countries got people.
383	00:25:00	00:25:01	Give us some names.
384	00:25:03	00:25:04	It'll be a long list.
385	00:25:04	00:25:10	Griss, we are not having any luck identifying the three teenagers from CC Drive.
386	00:25:10	00:25:12	It's been two days, no one's come forward.
387	00:25:12	00:25:15	Without an ID, it's like they never even existed.
388	00:25:15	00:25:19	We need to get their faces out in the public-- newspapers, billboards.
389	00:25:19	00:25:23	Well, maybe you could breathe a little bit more life into them.
390	00:25:23	00:25:26	Yeah. I'm pretty good at mouth-to-mouth.
391	00:26:39	00:26:42	Gentra just loved the hip-hop music.
392	00:26:42	00:26:46	And it kept her out on the streets.
393	00:26:46	00:26:49	She actually wanted to be a rapper herself.
394	00:26:49	00:26:52	She did a couple of talent shows.
395	00:26:52	00:26:54	Didn't do too well.
396	00:26:54	00:26:58	So she joined a street team.
397	00:26:58	00:26:59	A street team?
398	00:26:59	00:27:04	Groups of kids who hit the streets to promote their favorite rapper.
399	00:27:07	00:27:09	It kept Gentra around what she loved.
400	00:27:09	00:27:10	Do you know which rapper she worked for?
401	00:27:10	00:27:13	Hi-Def.
402	00:27:13	00:27:16	That's what he calls himself.
403	00:27:16	00:27:23	The State of Nevada's willing to pay to send your daughter back to California for burial.
404	00:27:23	00:27:27	I couldn't afford to bury my husband.
405	00:27:27	00:27:31	In that case, she'll be cremated.
406	00:27:31	00:27:33	I'll make sure you get the remains.
407	00:27:33	00:27:36	You send her ashes to Hi-Def.
408	00:28:10	00:28:11	That's our guy.
409	00:28:12	00:28:14	The one with the tats. That's Hi-Def.
410	00:28:16	00:28:19	Looks like Dollar's crew is here, too.
411	00:28:19	00:28:20	All the rappers come to MAGIC.
412	00:28:21	00:28:22	Go ahead, I'll catch up.
413	00:28:31	00:28:33	Afternoon.
414	00:28:33	00:28:35	You must be in the wrong spot.
415	00:28:35	00:28:36	This isn't the security hut.
416	00:28:36	00:28:37	We need to talk to Hi-Def.
417	00:28:37	00:28:38	Can't wait till after the show?
418	00:28:38	00:28:41	Either you get him or we will.
419	00:28:52	00:28:54	What do you cops want from me?
420	00:28:54	00:28:56	You ever see these kids?
421	00:28:57	00:29:00	Never.
422	00:29:00	00:29:01	I have. They're from our street team.
423	00:29:01	00:29:04	They look kind of weird in those pictures, but Ray never smiles.
424	00:29:04	00:29:05	They're dead.
425	00:29:06	00:29:07	What?
426	00:29:07	00:29:08	They've been gone three days.
427	00:29:08	00:29:09	You didn't notice?
428	00:29:09	00:29:11	Don't look at me, ma'am.
429	00:29:11	00:29:14	I never seen those kids before ever, sorry.
430	00:29:14	00:29:16	Look, we've got kids coming and going all the time.
431	00:29:16	00:29:18	It's hard to keep up.
432	00:29:18	00:29:20	I mean, I know who they are; it's Ray, Marvin and Gentra.
433	00:29:20	00:29:22	Do you know their last names?
434	00:29:22	00:29:23	No, I'm sorry.
435	00:29:23	00:29:27	Well, do you know where they got this?
436	00:29:32	00:29:33	Probably the same place I got this.
437	00:29:43	00:29:46	Hey, guys.
438	00:29:46	00:29:47	Whoa, whoa, whoa. How you doing?
439	00:29:47	00:29:50	Let me get one of those for you.
440	00:29:50	00:29:51	Here you go.
441	00:29:51	00:29:53	No, thanks, man, I'm all set.
442	00:29:53	00:29:56	You know, personally, I think it's a bad idea to hit on blackjack.
443	00:29:57	00:29:59	Well, you know, that's just how we do.
444	00:29:59	00:30:00	We never bust.
445	00:30:00	00:30:02	I know all about Dollar.
446	00:30:03	00:30:04	What's your connection?
447	00:30:04	00:30:06	Are you a cop?
448	00:30:06	00:30:07	I work with the police department, yeah.
449	00:30:07	00:30:10	Crime lab. My name's Nick Stokes.
450	00:30:10	00:30:13	Drops. And let's just say Dollar pays the bills.
451	00:30:14	00:30:15	The video just showed up on my desk.
452	00:30:15	00:30:16	First day of the show.
453	00:30:16	00:30:18	It was in a plain manila envelope.
454	00:30:18	00:30:19	So you put it on the net.
455	00:30:19	00:30:22	I never said that, but things happen.
456	00:30:22	00:30:25	Did Hi-Def and Dollar have a beef before this?
457	00:30:25	00:30:28	Yeah, a couple of years ago, Dollar did song called New Vegas.
458	00:30:28	00:30:31	Talking about how Las Vegas is the new New York.
459	00:30:31	00:30:33	Hi-Def is New York.
460	00:30:33	00:30:34	He and Dollar been punking each other ever since.
461	00:30:36	00:30:38	What's the deal with these street teams.
462	00:30:38	00:30:39	What's going on?
463	00:30:39	00:30:42	They do all the filthy, dirty, grimy promo for Dollar.
464	00:30:42	00:30:45	Snipe posters, give away stickers, pass CDs around.
465	00:30:45	00:30:46	Nothing new.
466	00:30:46	00:30:50	You know, three kids were murdered the other night doing the exact same thing.
467	00:30:50	00:30:52	What can I say, man?
468	00:30:52	00:30:53	These kids run the streets, bro.
469	00:30:53	00:30:57	Anybody at any given time can run up on them and try and lullaby their ass.
470	00:30:57	00:30:58	Yeah, I don't know about that.
471	00:30:58	00:31:04	They were putting up posters of your boy Dollar-- ones that made him look a lot stupider than just hitting on blackjack, you know what I mean?
472	00:31:06	00:31:08	Take a look at these kids.
473	00:31:08	00:31:11	See if you recognize any of them.
474	00:31:11	00:31:13	Nope.
475	00:31:13	00:31:14	Show them.
476	00:31:19	00:31:21	Nice suit.
477	00:31:21	00:31:26	Glad to see you dressed for the occasion.
478	00:31:26	00:31:27	No.
479	00:31:27	00:31:30	Eh, sorry, Crime Lab, Nick Stokes.
480	00:31:30	00:31:32	Nobody here's got a clue.
481	00:31:32	00:31:35	Yeah, okay.
482	00:31:35	00:31:37	Yeah, okay.
483	00:31:37	00:31:39	Oh, well, what do you know?
484	00:31:39	00:31:40	There goes one of my birds.
485	00:31:40	00:31:41	Sorry, got to go.
486	00:31:41	00:31:43	Peace.
487	00:31:43	00:31:45	I'll see you soon, dawg.
488	00:31:45	00:31:47	Yeah, whatever.
489	00:31:47	00:31:49	Look, you need any more posters, just scream at me.
490	00:31:49	00:31:50	Hey, Tweety!
491	00:31:51	00:31:53	Tweety!
492	00:32:09	00:32:10	Hey. Hey.
493	00:32:10	00:32:16	Mandy matched two prints off the photo that you gave to Dollar's street team to the unknowns that I found in the low rider. Mm-hmm.
494	00:32:16	00:32:20	One was on the passenger side door, the other one was on the steering wheel.
495	00:32:20	00:32:26	Hey, yo, yo, yo, make sure you tell him about that crazy new suit line we got coming out.
496	00:32:27	00:32:28	Now what?
497	00:32:28	00:32:30	I'm here for Drops.
498	00:32:30	00:32:31	Hang up.
499	00:32:36	00:32:37	I'm expanding into Asia.
500	00:32:37	00:32:39	No kidding?
501	00:32:39	00:32:40	Where's your street team?
502	00:32:40	00:32:43	They're grubbing-- they went down to the Cafe Hospital.
503	00:32:43	00:32:46	You know, they're kind of Benigni over that Waldorf salad.
504	00:32:48	00:32:49	They're murder suspects.
505	00:32:50	00:32:52	Get them up here.
506	00:32:52	00:32:55	( sighs ) This is very disappointing.
507	00:33:05	00:33:09	Yo, gentlemen, on the wall.
508	00:33:13	00:33:16	I didn't shoot nobody.
509	00:33:16	00:33:21	Please, you got to believe me.
510	00:33:21	00:33:24	I just wanted to drive that car.
511	00:33:24	00:33:26	Morris was always bragging about it.
512	00:33:26	00:33:28	I'll believe you if you tell me what really happened.
513	00:33:31	00:33:33	I was picking up an order for Drops.
514	00:33:34	00:33:37	I saw that poster on the wall.
515	00:33:37	00:33:41	I just told the other guys what I saw.
516	00:33:41	00:33:46	Look, I know I shouldn't have done that, 'cause as soon as I did, Morris wanted to see the poster.
517	00:33:46	00:33:48	Morris would do anything for Dollar.
518	00:33:48	00:33:50	You know, Dollar's his life.
519	00:33:50	00:33:53	He only has Dollar in his iPod.
520	00:33:54	00:33:55	No one else.
521	00:33:55	00:33:58	So then you went to CC Drive.
522	00:33:58	00:34:01	Yeah.
523	00:34:01	00:34:03	We just waited for them to show up.
524	00:34:03	00:34:06	Who is they?
525	00:34:06	00:34:08	Some other snippers.
526	00:34:08	00:34:10	High-def street team.
527	00:34:10	00:34:18	Morris didn't care who they were, as long as they was putting up them posters, they was dead to him. Morris, hurry up, man-- you just said you were gonna scare them. Nah, man.
528	00:34:19	00:34:20	that poster makes Dollar look like a ho.
529	00:34:20	00:34:22	Dollar's nobody's ho.
530	00:34:30	00:34:32	I ran them over.
531	00:34:34	00:34:40	After he got the first one... he said he had to get the rest.
532	00:34:40	00:34:45	( gunshots ) He shot the second one next, down off the palm tree.
533	00:34:48	00:34:52	The last one almost got away.
534	00:34:57	00:34:59	What was Dante doing during all of this?
535	00:34:59	00:35:03	I was just riding shotgun, watching Morris.
536	00:35:03	00:35:05	You didn't do anything about it?
537	00:35:05	00:35:07	He was out of his mind.
538	00:35:07	00:35:09	Where did Morris get the gun?
539	00:35:09	00:35:10	It was in the trunk.
540	00:35:10	00:35:13	He said his brother swiped it off some dumb-ass cop.
541	00:35:13	00:35:14	Where is it now?
542	00:35:14	00:35:16	Broken apart and thrown away.
543	00:35:16	00:35:18	Pro style.
544	00:35:18	00:35:22	Looks like you and your buddy are gonna get broken apart and thrown away, too.
545	00:35:22	00:35:24	I guess there's nothing else to say.
546	00:35:24	00:35:27	Guess not.
547	00:35:53	00:35:54	This ain't right, dog.
548	00:35:54	00:35:57	Now who's the bitch? Huh?
549	00:35:57	00:35:59	Who's the bitch now?
550	00:36:31	00:36:35	I figure Dante had that revolver when he was going up and down those poles.
551	00:36:35	00:36:39	Grip gets thumped, chips off in the satchel.
552	00:36:39	00:36:43	Wood grain seems consistent, This means Dante made the video.
553	00:36:43	00:36:46	You said Dante works for Dollar.
554	00:36:46	00:36:49	Mm-hmm. He's a fan.
555	00:36:49	00:36:51	Why would he humiliate someone he respects?
556	00:36:52	00:36:55	I don't know.
557	00:36:55	00:37:01	I don't know, but on the video, Dante did say, Who's the bitch now?
558	00:37:01	00:37:05	So... you could say it got a little personal.
559	00:37:05	00:37:11	So... get personal.
560	00:38:14	00:38:18	Yo, what's up, it's your boy Dollar, from Chicks Gone Nuts.
561	00:38:18	00:38:20	We're out here in Vegas, baby.
562	00:38:20	00:38:24	We got whatever you want-- chicks, jewelry.
563	00:38:24	00:38:25	We got the bottles.
564	00:38:25	00:38:27	Come holler at us, you know.
565	00:38:28	00:38:31	Mm.
566	00:38:31	00:38:34	So you obviously know Dollar.
567	00:38:34	00:38:40	You know, your brother has been arrested for felony kidnapping and assault and accessory to murder.
568	00:38:41	00:38:47	Now if there's anything that you know that can help us understand his motivation, now's the time to tell us, okay?
569	00:38:50	00:38:54	Tisha...
570	00:38:54	00:38:57	what happened to your face?
571	00:39:01	00:39:09	About a year ago, during Black Spring Break, Dollar caught me walking through the MGM.
572	00:39:09	00:39:11	He was hosting this Chicks Gone Nuts video.
573	00:39:11	00:39:16	Said he'd give me $500 to put on a bikini and jump on his hotel bed.
574	00:39:16	00:39:19	I needed the money...
575	00:39:19	00:39:22	so I did it.
576	00:39:22	00:39:25	I got my money and went home.
577	00:39:25	00:39:30	Couple months later, Dante came busting into my room with the tape.
578	00:39:30	00:39:37	He cussed me out, then forgot about that, too.
579	00:39:39	00:39:42	Until my dad saw the tape.
580	00:39:46	00:39:51	He called me a whore and a slut.
581	00:39:51	00:39:55	He had his car keys in his hand.
582	00:39:56	00:40:07	He cut up my face, my chest, my stomach.
583	00:40:07	00:40:11	I haven't seen him since.
584	00:40:13	00:40:16	And Dante blamed Dollar.
585	00:40:16	00:40:21	He couldn't find Daddy.
586	00:40:21	00:40:24	He wouldn't blame me.
587	00:40:24	00:40:37	So he joins Dollar's street team to get close to him, close enough to sneak into his hotel room and videotape him, the same way he videotaped you.
588	00:40:40	00:40:45	I know he didn't mean for anyone to die.
589	00:40:45	00:40:47	He just did it for me.
