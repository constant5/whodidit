0	00:00:15	00:00:17	See, just like I told you, right?
1	00:00:19	00:00:22	It really brings back the good old days, huh?
2	00:00:25	00:00:29	So, what do you think it's worth?
3	00:02:55	00:02:57	Riley...
4	00:02:57	00:03:00	425, suspicious remains at the city dump.
5	00:03:00	00:03:01	Awesome.
6	00:03:01	00:03:04	Trash run for the low man on the totem pole.
7	00:03:04	00:03:06	I promise not to abuse my power over you.
8	00:03:06	00:03:07	Watch your back, Riley.
9	00:03:07	00:03:13	And for our new CSI level three, 411A, recovered stolen vehicle at McCarran.
10	00:03:14	00:03:18	Nick, 402, possible arson at the Burger Giant.
11	00:03:18	00:03:20	Well, there goes the night.
12	00:03:20	00:03:22	Why don't we all meet up at the coffee shop after work?
13	00:03:23	00:03:24	Level three over here is gonna buy.
14	00:03:25	00:03:27	I'll take care of breakfast.
15	00:03:28	00:03:31	And the 419 in Green Valley.
16	00:03:33	00:03:36	Looks like the king gets to sit on the bench for now.
17	00:03:37	00:03:38	That it?
18	00:03:41	00:03:43	No.
19	00:03:45	00:03:51	I know this has been a tough year for all of us, and I've been thinking...
20	00:03:51	00:03:54	I mean, more than usual.
21	00:03:54	00:03:57	I made a decision.
22	00:03:57	00:03:59	I'm gonna leave CSI.
23	00:04:04	00:04:09	Catherine will become the new supervisor, so you'll be in good hands.
24	00:04:13	00:04:21	While I'm clearing my caseload, Ecklie's preparing a list of candidates for a new level one hire, so...
25	00:04:21	00:04:23	you won't be shorthanded.
26	00:04:30	00:04:33	And I guess I just came off the bench.
27	00:04:33	00:04:36	419 at Mount Charleston.
28	00:04:36	00:04:37	Okay?
29	00:05:50	00:05:52	Sir?
30	00:05:52	00:05:53	You okay?
31	00:05:53	00:05:53	Yeah.
32	00:05:54	00:05:56	I was just wondering what it would be like to go fly fishing.
33	00:05:58	00:06:00	Uh, a couple of hikers came across the body this morning.
34	00:06:00	00:06:02	According to them, it's not a popular trail.
35	00:06:02	00:06:04	How long do you think that's been here?
36	00:06:04	00:06:05	I don't know.
37	00:06:06	00:06:08	Sealed bag, cool, moist environment.
38	00:06:08	00:06:10	Could be weeks, could be years.
39	00:06:10	00:06:11	But it's definitely human.
40	00:06:11	00:06:12	Call the coroner.
41	00:06:12	00:06:14	Tell him he's got soup to go.
42	00:06:16	00:06:18	This is Henry-5. We need a coroner...
43	00:06:28	00:06:30	All right, so let me get this straight.
44	00:06:30	00:06:36	Grissom didn't say that he was leaving permanently, so he could be taking a leave of absence.
45	00:06:36	00:06:38	That's a form of leaving, right?
46	00:06:38	00:06:40	I think this is leaving, leaving.
47	00:06:40	00:06:42	What's he gonna do?
48	00:06:42	00:06:44	Teach?
49	00:06:44	00:06:46	Write a book, go off and study bugs somewhere?
50	00:06:46	00:06:47	You know as much as I do, Nicky.
51	00:06:57	00:06:59	Star of David.
52	00:06:59	00:07:01	Looks like some kind of pendant.
53	00:07:01	00:07:02	Victim must have been Jewish.
54	00:07:02	00:07:05	These clothes are pretty generic.
55	00:07:05	00:07:08	Jeans, T-shirt, sneakers.
56	00:07:08	00:07:12	It's not gonna help with TOD or sex.
57	00:07:12	00:07:15	There's hair in our soup.
58	00:07:15	00:07:18	Most of them are brown, but some of them are blonde.
59	00:07:19	00:07:20	So, maybe the vic got a piece of the attacker.
60	00:07:20	00:07:24	Or maybe the victim just had a streak of dyed hair.
61	00:07:24	00:07:27	Hodges...
62	00:07:27	00:07:28	Hodges.
63	00:07:28	00:07:29	Hmm?
64	00:07:29	00:07:33	Collect and separate both sets of hairs.
65	00:07:33	00:07:34	Get them over to Wendy.
66	00:07:34	00:07:36	Run exemplars for mitochondrial DNA.
67	00:07:36	00:07:38	It's best to stay busy.
68	00:07:42	00:07:51	Based on skull morphology and femoral bone dimensions, I'd say we're looking at a Caucasian male, around five feet, nine inches.
69	00:07:51	00:07:57	Partial fusion of the coronal-cranial suture says that he was at least 25 years old.
70	00:07:57	00:07:59	Any idea of COD?
71	00:07:59	00:08:00	Very good idea.
72	00:08:00	00:08:02	Broken hyoid.
73	00:08:02	00:08:03	Strangulation. Yep.
74	00:08:05	00:08:07	Are you really leaving?
75	00:08:07	00:08:08	Yep.
76	00:08:10	00:08:12	Think of it this way, Doc.
77	00:08:12	00:08:14	You'll have somebody new you can tell all your old jokes to.
78	00:08:15	00:08:16	I like the old guy just fine.
79	00:08:16	00:08:20	Are you, uh, running away from something?
80	00:08:20	00:08:22	Or running to something?
81	00:08:22	00:08:23	Someone?
82	00:08:24	00:08:26	I'm running to my office.
83	00:08:26	00:08:27	I think you're nuts.
84	00:08:31	00:08:34	I am never going to retire.
85	00:09:23	00:09:26	The Dick and Jane Killer's name is Nathan Haskell.
86	00:09:26	00:09:32	Suspected of killing at least 14 people in Nevada, California and Arizona in the mid-90s.
87	00:09:32	00:09:35	He was picked up at a sobriety checkpoint near Reno.
88	00:09:35	00:09:36	It was a lucky break.
89	00:09:38	00:09:42	The blood on his car matched a male DB dumped in the desert several weeks earlier.
90	00:09:43	00:09:48	And he had blood under his nails which matched another male DB who had just been found.
91	00:09:48	00:09:50	A witness placed him with one of the vics.
92	00:09:50	00:09:52	There was a potential murder weapon.
93	00:09:52	00:09:53	Case went to trial.
94	00:09:53	00:09:56	In the middle, Haskell changed his plea.
95	00:09:57	00:10:00	He got life without parole, and he's serving it at Ely.
96	00:10:00	00:10:01	I remember this guy.
97	00:10:01	00:10:05	He was called the Dick and Jane Killer because he targeted couples.
98	00:10:05	00:10:08	It says here not any of the female vics were ever found.
99	00:10:08	00:10:17	He refused to discuss the females, but seven male bodies were found in various remote locations, each with postmortem stab wounds.
100	00:10:17	00:10:19	The first body they found had two stab wounds.
101	00:10:19	00:10:22	The second body had three stab wounds.
102	00:10:22	00:10:29	The third had four, then five, six, seven and eight, so the theory was that the first couple was never found.
103	00:10:29	00:10:37	And Joel Steiner and his fiancÃ©e were considered possible victims since they lived near DJK and they were reported missing in 1997.
104	00:10:37	00:10:41	That's before any of the other confirmed victims.
105	00:10:41	00:10:44	Guess all we need is a positive ID on Joel.
106	00:10:48	00:10:52	I had this made for Joel for his bar mitzvah.
107	00:10:52	00:10:57	He had a matching one made for his fiancÃ©e when they got engaged.
108	00:10:57	00:10:59	Oh, Mrs. Steiner, I'm sorry.
109	00:11:00	00:11:02	You can't take it with you.
110	00:11:02	00:11:04	It's, uh... it's evidence in an active case.
111	00:11:04	00:11:07	I promise to get it back to you right after we confirm the I.D.
112	00:11:07	00:11:08	of your son's remains. I will.
113	00:11:08	00:11:09	I'll get it back to you.
114	00:11:09	00:11:11	But you can't keep it right now.
115	00:11:11	00:11:13	Sorry. It's all right.
116	00:11:13	00:11:15	Thank you.
117	00:11:15	00:11:18	Thanks.
118	00:11:18	00:11:20	I'm also going to need DNA samples from each of you.
119	00:11:20	00:11:22	But you already have Joel's DNA.
120	00:11:22	00:11:25	We gave it to the police in Reno, 11 years ago.
121	00:11:25	00:11:28	I gave them his toothbrush.
122	00:11:28	00:11:34	They sent the sample out to a private lab for DNA analysis, and that lab, um, misplaced it or lost it.
123	00:11:34	00:11:36	It happens.
124	00:11:36	00:11:39	David, I've been meaning to talk to you.
125	00:11:39	00:11:41	It's a little too late for that, huh?
126	00:11:41	00:11:43	Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.
127	00:11:43	00:11:45	Have a nice life.
128	00:12:43	00:12:50	Well, when I heard that those hairs might actually be connected to the Dick and Jane killer, I just put the screws to this guy I know at Accuregen.
129	00:12:51	00:12:52	And he ran our mito samples immediately.
130	00:12:53	00:12:55	What do you got on him?
131	00:12:55	00:12:57	He's my uncle.
132	00:12:57	00:13:01	I really didn't want to wait around for three weeks and then get the results after you were gone.
133	00:13:01	00:13:07	And it turns out that the blonde hairs are definitely a mito DNA match to Nathan Haskell.
134	00:13:07	00:13:09	Well, as far as we know, he was an only child.
135	00:13:09	00:13:11	So, it's got to be him. Grissom.
136	00:13:14	00:13:17	I just want to thank you for everything.
137	00:13:17	00:13:20	For the support and the encouragement that you've given me.
138	00:13:21	00:13:23	You earned it.
139	00:13:25	00:13:26	Wendy.
140	00:13:26	00:13:30	Wasn't the body soup vic I.D.'d as the DJK's first victim?
141	00:13:30	00:13:36	Yes. Brass said that Joel Steiner's parents confirmed that the Star of David pendant was his.
142	00:13:36	00:13:38	And we're getting their DNA to positively establish I.D.
143	00:13:38	00:13:41	Okay, I don't believe that it was Joel Steiner.
144	00:13:41	00:13:45	The sneakers that Soup Man was wearing were made two years ago.
145	00:13:45	00:13:49	And the Dick and Jane Killer's been in jail for at least ten.
146	00:13:49	00:13:51	Well, how did he end up with DJK's hair on his body?
147	00:13:51	00:13:53	And who is he?
148	00:13:56	00:13:59	Lindsey was once given a gift certificate for a pair of customized jeans.
149	00:13:59	00:14:07	So we go to the store, we spend two hours picking out the wash, the rivets, you name it.
150	00:14:07	00:14:12	And-and she has her boyfriend's name embroidered on her butt pocket.
151	00:14:12	00:14:14	Well, guess what?
152	00:14:14	00:14:16	She breaks up with the guy a week later.
153	00:14:16	00:14:17	She doesn't wear 'em once.
154	00:14:17	00:14:19	Still beats a tattoo, right?
155	00:14:19	00:14:20	Oh, don't go there.
156	00:14:20	00:14:25	In any case, the sneakers were definitely a custom job.
157	00:14:25	00:14:29	We got a warrant for the customer records.
158	00:14:34	00:14:43	Catherine, I, uh, I know I surprised you today with the...
159	00:14:43	00:14:44	I knew.
160	00:14:48	00:14:50	I knew before you knew.
161	00:14:59	00:15:07	Well, looks like the sneakers were designed by a Gerald Tolliver.
162	00:15:07	00:15:08	See if he's in missing persons.
163	00:15:13	00:15:15	Well, he's not only missing, he's got a record.
164	00:15:15	00:15:17	Petty larceny, grand larceny.
165	00:15:17	00:15:19	Several drug busts.
166	00:15:19	00:15:25	Reno P.D. registered him as a criminal informant just before he disappeared, six months ago.
167	00:15:25	00:15:27	You know what that means?
168	00:15:27	00:15:28	Road trip.
169	00:15:38	00:15:40	Kenny Martz, Reno P.D.
170	00:15:40	00:15:42	Nick Stokes. Greg Sanders.
171	00:15:42	00:15:44	So, did you work this case?
172	00:15:44	00:15:46	No, but I brought the related file.
173	00:15:47	00:15:50	Anything having to do with DJK is near and dear to my heart.
174	00:15:50	00:15:51	Busted him back when I was in uniform.
175	00:15:51	00:15:53	Practically made my career.
176	00:15:53	00:15:56	So you guys held this scene for six months?
177	00:15:56	00:15:57	Not intentionally.
178	00:15:57	00:15:59	The house is still in probate.
179	00:16:10	00:16:13	Our CSIs found some blood drops on this wall.
180	00:16:13	00:16:17	They sampled it for DNA, and matched it to Gerald Tolliver.
181	00:16:17	00:16:19	We'd gotten him to roll on some local junkies.
182	00:16:19	00:16:21	We were just starting to move him up the food chain.
183	00:16:21	00:16:25	We figured he pissed somebody off, got into a fight, skipped town.
184	00:16:25	00:16:27	Is there blood on the floor as well?
185	00:16:27	00:16:29	Yeah.
186	00:16:29	00:16:31	They luminoled this area.
187	00:16:31	00:16:35	There wasn't much blood, not enough to suggest murder.
188	00:16:35	00:16:39	They found what appears to be a partial shoe tread in this blood.
189	00:16:43	00:16:48	Look, Gerald Tolliver was 17 when DJK was doing his business.
190	00:16:48	00:16:49	He never turned up in the investigation.
191	00:16:49	00:16:50	So what's the connection?
192	00:16:51	00:16:52	We don't know.
193	00:16:52	00:16:53	That's why we're here.
194	00:16:53	00:16:57	Looks like Gerald was a collector of sorts.
195	00:16:57	00:17:00	Maybe he was one of those murderabilia freaks, you know?
196	00:17:00	00:17:10	All it takes is one shady prison barber, and suddenly people are bidding for a lock of DJK's hair on eBay. But Joel Steiner's body was never found.
197	00:17:10	00:17:12	How'd this guy end up with his Star of David?
198	00:17:12	00:17:14	I don't know.
199	00:17:14	00:17:19	But I'm betting a guy like this has other little treasures stashed around here somewhere.
200	00:18:58	00:19:06	According to court transcripts, Haskell's attorneys were attempting to argue that the murders were the work of more than one killer.
201	00:19:06	00:19:08	That's when Haskell changed his plea.
202	00:19:08	00:19:09	What was the theory?
203	00:19:09	00:19:14	That it would've been impossible for Haskell to have strangled the males while simultaneously controlling the females.
204	00:19:14	00:19:16	They could've been sedated.
205	00:19:16	00:19:18	Tox on the male vics was clean.
206	00:19:18	00:19:20	Except for traces of THC.
207	00:19:20	00:19:23	Well, these guys are all narcissists.
208	00:19:23	00:19:25	Maybe Haskell just didn't want to share the spotlight.
209	00:19:25	00:19:28	Or maybe Gerald was more than just a murderabilia collector.
210	00:19:28	00:19:31	Maybe he was an accomplice.
211	00:19:48	00:19:50	Hey. Greg.
212	00:19:50	00:19:51	You guys aren't going to believe this.
213	00:19:51	00:19:55	Remember that apparent S &amp;amp;amp;amp; M double murder from five weeks ago?
214	00:19:55	00:20:01	Well, whoever killed Gerald Tolliver was also involved in the murders of Ian Wallace and Justine Stefani...
215	00:20:01	00:20:04	His shoe print was at both crime scenes.
216	00:20:04	00:20:07	And Ian had nine postmortem stab wounds.
217	00:20:07	00:20:12	Didn't mean much at the time, but it's consistent with the DJK's MO.
218	00:20:12	00:20:16	I think we're dealing with a copycat who was trying to make Ian and Justine the ninth couple.
219	00:20:16	00:20:24	A DJK copycat who just so happened to kill a DJK accomplice that nobody knew existed till just now?
220	00:20:24	00:20:26	I've clearly missed something.
221	00:20:26	00:20:27	I'll catch you up.
222	00:20:27	00:20:30	So let's just go up to Ely and question him.
223	00:20:30	00:20:33	This guy pled guilty to avoid even the suggestion that he wasn't responsible.
224	00:20:33	00:20:35	He's not going to talk to us.
225	00:20:35	00:20:37	All roads lead to Rome.
226	00:20:37	00:20:44	So Ely State Prison sent over all the correspondence, video logs, phone records of the Dick and Jane Killer.
227	00:20:44	00:20:50	So I told the detectives to be on the lookout for any names that are associated with both the DJK and Gerald Tolliver.
228	00:20:50	00:20:51	I think that might be our best bet.
229	00:20:51	00:20:53	That's a lot of material.
230	00:20:53	00:20:55	Yeah, well, the guy likes to give interviews.
231	00:20:55	00:20:58	Dateline, 20/20 Time magazine.
232	00:20:58	00:20:59	The guy likes to talk.
233	00:20:59	00:21:03	I think he likes to have people listen to him.
234	00:21:03	00:21:05	So I hear you're moving on.
235	00:21:06	00:21:07	I am.
236	00:21:07	00:21:09	That's too bad.
237	00:21:09	00:21:12	We'll stay in touch.
238	00:21:12	00:21:16	Sure. You know, the barbecue, Labor Day, Fourth of July.
239	00:21:16	00:21:17	Go out on the boat.
240	00:21:17	00:21:20	You got a boat?
241	00:21:20	00:21:21	No.
242	00:21:22	00:21:24	Captain, something interesting.
243	00:21:24	00:21:32	It's not a connection between DJK and Gerald Tolliver, but there is a lot of back and forth between the warden and a professor at WLVU.
244	00:21:32	00:21:36	Apparently DJK's participating in some kind of criminology seminar.
245	00:21:36	00:21:39	They're setting up a video conference for a Q &amp;amp;amp;amp; A with the students, the whole bit.
246	00:21:39	00:21:43	Wow. I'd take that class.
247	00:21:45	00:21:46	That's a good idea.
248	00:21:46	00:21:48	You should do that.
249	00:21:48	00:21:52	These letters say the seminar is open to faculty.
250	00:21:52	00:21:55	You could go in as a visiting professor.
251	00:21:55	00:21:57	So what's the real professor going to say?
252	00:21:57	00:21:58	We won't tell him.
253	00:21:58	00:22:02	We'd be risking too much if he's not willing to play ball, anyway.
254	00:22:03	00:22:05	I'll clear it with the university administration.
255	00:22:14	00:22:17	Hello. I'm Dr. Raymond Langston.
256	00:22:17	00:22:25	I'd like to welcome all those faculty members who have bravely come out of the closet and revealed themselves to be murder freaks.
257	00:22:26	00:22:32	Now, one of things I am most often asked is, What does a serial killer look like?
258	00:22:32	00:22:34	It's not a bad question.
259	00:22:34	00:22:40	Statistically speaking, nine out of ten are Caucasian males under the age of 30, but you never know.
260	00:22:40	00:22:43	There was the case of a mother and daughter.
261	00:22:43	00:22:51	In a three-year spree, they killed over and over again, systematically murdering ten infants, and they ate the remains.
262	00:22:56	00:22:58	That's Passion and Pom.
263	00:22:58	00:23:02	Jane Goodall observed their rampage in Gombe in the 70s.
264	00:23:02	00:23:07	Now, remember, we human beings share 99.5% of our DNA with chimps.
265	00:23:07	00:23:09	The urge to kill...
266	00:23:09	00:23:14	maybe it is just a big-brain mammal thing, but it is in all of us.
267	00:23:14	00:23:19	I want to reemphasize the ground rules here.
268	00:23:19	00:23:21	Orderly conduct is to be maintained at all times.
269	00:23:21	00:23:24	Don't reveal any personal information.
270	00:23:24	00:23:25	No names.
271	00:23:25	00:23:31	And the warden has requested that the ladies please refrain from wearing any revealing clothing.
272	00:23:31	00:23:34	My dear, you might want to put on a sweater.
273	00:23:35	00:23:43	Now, last semester, some of you came to me and said you wanted to know what the face of evil looked like.
274	00:23:47	00:23:49	Well, here it is.
275	00:23:50	00:23:52	Hello, class.
276	00:23:53	00:23:55	Everybody ready to learn?
277	00:23:59	00:24:01	What can you tell us about your father?
278	00:24:02	00:24:07	Apart from the fact that he was a mean, miserable son of a bitch who beat me at every occasion...
279	00:24:08	00:24:09	nothing.
280	00:24:09	00:24:11	What about your mother?
281	00:24:11	00:24:14	Was that who that lady was who lived with us?
282	00:24:14	00:24:15	I always wondered.
283	00:24:15	00:24:16	Mr. Haskell.
284	00:24:16	00:24:18	I...
285	00:24:18	00:24:21	killed my first small animal when I was nine.
286	00:24:21	00:24:23	It was a cat.
287	00:24:23	00:24:25	It's usually a cat.
288	00:24:25	00:24:26	Mr. Haskell.
289	00:24:26	00:24:28	No one knows why that is.
290	00:24:28	00:24:30	I mean, I know it's a terrible thing...
291	00:24:30	00:24:34	If you're going to waste our time on playing games and phony remorse, I'll pull the plug right now.
292	00:24:34	00:24:37	Okay.
293	00:24:37	00:24:39	Honesty it is, then.
294	00:24:39	00:24:41	I didn't like your book.
295	00:24:42	00:24:45	It's too technical and too depressing.
296	00:24:45	00:24:48	Then, let's talk about something you enjoyed...
297	00:24:48	00:24:50	your first kill.
298	00:24:50	00:24:58	Oh, you never forget your first time, but I think that discussion's a little too intimate for this stage of our relationship.
299	00:24:58	00:25:00	Maybe when know each other a little better.
300	00:25:00	00:25:02	That's why we're here.
301	00:25:02	00:25:05	Class, question and answer.
302	00:25:07	00:25:10	Serial killers usually have some sort of selection process.
303	00:25:10	00:25:12	What was yours? How'd you choose your victims?
304	00:25:12	00:25:14	Did you ever buy a car?
305	00:25:14	00:25:16	You go down to the showroom.
306	00:25:16	00:25:18	You're pretty sure you're gonna get one, but why the red one?
307	00:25:18	00:25:20	Why not the blue one?
308	00:25:20	00:25:22	Nobody knows, but...
309	00:25:22	00:25:26	just one of them speaks to you and that's the one you got to have.
310	00:25:28	00:25:31	How much premeditation was involved?
311	00:25:31	00:25:34	Did you fantasize about what you were going to do?
312	00:25:34	00:25:35	Of course, I did.
313	00:25:36	00:25:38	All the time.
314	00:25:38	00:25:40	You remind me of my first lay.
315	00:25:41	00:25:43	She was a hooker.
316	00:25:45	00:25:47	I mean that as a compliment.
317	00:25:47	00:25:49	Did, uh...
318	00:25:49	00:25:52	you ever share any of your experiences with anyone?
319	00:25:52	00:25:54	Like, with a buddy?
320	00:25:54	00:25:56	I didn't have any buddies.
321	00:25:56	00:25:57	Well, you must have had some friends.
322	00:25:57	00:25:59	You seem like you could be friendly.
323	00:25:59	00:26:02	These days, I mostly have fans.
324	00:26:02	00:26:08	I get at least two or three marriage proposals every month, but...
325	00:26:08	00:26:15	they don't allow conjugal visits, so why carry the baggage when you can't have the fun?
326	00:26:16	00:26:18	You're not a student.
327	00:26:18	00:26:21	What do you teach?
328	00:26:22	00:26:23	Sociology.
329	00:26:24	00:26:27	Tell us your definition of fun.
330	00:26:28	00:26:31	Fun is taking something away from somebody.
331	00:26:32	00:26:34	Like...
332	00:26:35	00:26:38	a nice Jewish girl, for example.
333	00:26:38	00:26:40	Taking her off on a little vacation.
334	00:26:40	00:26:45	Just three days and three nights of Heaven on Earth.
335	00:26:45	00:26:47	And then... just Heaven.
336	00:26:49	00:26:51	L'chaim.
337	00:26:51	00:27:01	The night before Ian Wallace and Justine Stefani were killed, they went to a Paramore concert, and according to his credit card records, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
338	00:27:02	00:27:06	And we also found these old Pearl Jam ticket stubs in Gerald Tolliver's mattress.
339	00:27:06	00:27:13	According to the DJK file, Joel Steiner and his fiancÃ©e went missing after attending that concert back in '97.
340	00:27:13	00:27:17	So, maybe the killer finds his victims at concerts.
341	00:27:17	00:27:20	Exactly, so we checked with the online ticketing service.
342	00:27:20	00:27:27	Hard tickets were mailed to Ian-- they all get scanned at the venue-- but on the night of Ian and Justine's murder, they were never used.
343	00:27:27	00:27:29	But the ones from Saturday night were.
344	00:27:31	00:27:34	You waste a couple... why waste the tickets?
345	00:27:34	00:27:39	You never revealed the location of any of your female victims. Why?
346	00:27:39	00:27:43	Because nobody ever asked me that question ever before.
347	00:27:43	00:27:45	I always thought it was strange.
348	00:27:45	00:27:48	Well, then, tell us now.
349	00:27:48	00:27:50	Why not?
350	00:27:50	00:27:52	You're serving two consecutive life sentences.
351	00:27:52	00:27:53	You have nothing to lose.
352	00:27:53	00:28:00	Of course I do, Professor, because when I took those women, they stopped being somebody's...
353	00:28:00	00:28:01	girlfriend or...
354	00:28:01	00:28:03	sister or...
355	00:28:03	00:28:05	daughter...
356	00:28:05	00:28:07	or fiancÃ©e.
357	00:28:07	00:28:09	They became what I wanted them to be.
358	00:28:10	00:28:12	They're mine.
359	00:28:12	00:28:14	Did any of them resist?
360	00:28:16	00:28:18	No one tried to escape or fight back?
361	00:28:20	00:28:25	Tiffany and Cynthia fought a little... at first.
362	00:28:25	00:28:27	(Langston clears throat) Um...
363	00:28:28	00:28:29	How did you control them?
364	00:28:31	00:28:33	Not with force.
365	00:28:33	00:28:42	I'm gonna return to the Jewish theme here, Doctor, although I want you to know that I have also killed Catholics and Protestants and one atheist.
366	00:28:42	00:28:47	By the way, they all prayed eventually.
367	00:28:47	00:29:07	Anyway, during the Holocaust, when the first arrivals at the death camps realized they were going to be killed, they flew into a panic, so the guards-- the Nazis-- started telling them that they were going to be put to work, that their skills were going to be used, and they all calmed down.
368	00:29:07	00:29:11	And they all marched obediently into the showers.
369	00:29:13	00:29:16	You have to give them hope.
370	00:29:16	00:29:29	If you bring a human being to the brink of death, and then you offer a chance-- no matter how small a chance-- to survive, they'll grab it.
371	00:29:29	00:29:31	And they'll thank you for it.
372	00:29:32	00:29:34	And then...
373	00:29:34	00:29:36	you can do whatever you want.
374	00:29:38	00:29:40	And believe me...
375	00:29:40	00:29:42	I did.
376	00:29:47	00:29:48	Langston.
377	00:29:48	00:29:50	Hello, warden, thank you for calling.
378	00:29:50	00:29:52	Am I making you proud of me?
379	00:29:52	00:29:54	Thank you.
380	00:29:54	00:29:57	Okay, that's it for today.
381	00:29:57	00:29:58	See you tomorrow.
382	00:29:58	00:30:00	Be careful out there.
383	00:30:09	00:30:11	Could I buy you a drink?
384	00:30:13	00:30:15	Definitely.
385	00:30:24	00:30:29	So, all these videos are from the Paramore show the night after Justine and Ian were killed?
386	00:30:30	00:30:32	Got to love the Internet.
387	00:30:32	00:30:36	The vics' tickets were in section 203...
388	00:30:36	00:30:39	seats M26 and 28.
389	00:30:39	00:30:41	And this video...
390	00:30:41	00:30:44	has the best view of those seats.
391	00:30:46	00:30:49	Looks like they have the same logos on their ball caps.
392	00:30:49	00:30:50	I'll enhance that.
393	00:30:53	00:30:54	Reliant Wash and Wax.
394	00:30:55	00:30:56	Uh, yeah, I recognize them.
395	00:30:56	00:30:58	That's Richie and Donny-- they're in the tunnel.
396	00:30:58	00:30:59	Yeah, okay. Yeah.
397	00:30:59	00:31:01	All right, shut the machine down. Okay.
398	00:31:01	00:31:03	Go in the west entrance.
399	00:31:03	00:31:05	Buckle up these two guys.
400	00:31:07	00:31:09	Las Vegas Police!
401	00:31:11	00:31:13	Las Vegas Police.
402	00:31:13	00:31:15	Put your hands on the hood.
403	00:31:15	00:31:17	Put your hands on the hood where I can see them.
404	00:31:22	00:31:24	Okay, here's a simple quiz.
405	00:31:24	00:31:26	The Paramore concert five weeks ago.
406	00:31:27	00:31:28	Where'd you get the tickets?
407	00:31:28	00:31:30	I told you not to do it, you idiot.
408	00:31:30	00:31:31	I got them off a scalper.
409	00:31:31	00:31:34	That's not illegal-- it's the scalping them that's illegal. Shut up.
410	00:31:34	00:31:35	I don't know what this guy's talking...
411	00:31:35	00:31:37	coming in here... What the scalper look like?
412	00:31:37	00:31:38	I don't know, it was dark.
413	00:31:38	00:31:41	It was in a parking lot.
414	00:31:41	00:31:43	Some skinny white dude, man.
415	00:31:43	00:31:45	Well, that's a big help.
416	00:31:45	00:31:46	Any chance either of you have the ticket stub?
417	00:31:46	00:31:48	Yeah, I do.
418	00:31:48	00:31:50	It's in my wallet.
419	00:31:53	00:31:54	What is this, a phone book?
420	00:31:54	00:31:56	Yeah, I keep everything.
421	00:32:39	00:32:40	Somebody's home.
422	00:32:40	00:32:41	Come on, let's go.
423	00:32:41	00:32:43	Let's go, go, go, go.
424	00:32:47	00:32:50	(knocking) Curtis Keesey-- LVPD! Open up!
425	00:33:07	00:33:10	The lights are on a timer.
426	00:33:42	00:33:48	Late instar, synthesiomyia nudiseta.
427	00:33:48	00:33:52	So, I hear you've been going back to school.
428	00:33:52	00:33:54	Sort of.
429	00:33:54	00:33:56	I loved college.
430	00:33:56	00:33:58	Me, too.
431	00:34:00	00:34:02	Green Bottle Blow Fly.
432	00:34:02	00:34:07	These typically pupate in about two weeks and emerge as adults in four.
433	00:34:07	00:34:11	The AC on in the trailer slows down the timeline a bit.
434	00:34:11	00:34:15	He's been dead at least a month.
435	00:34:15	00:34:18	You're going to miss this, you are.
436	00:34:18	00:34:21	There's bugs everywhere, David.
437	00:34:21	00:34:24	I will miss you, though.
438	00:34:43	00:34:49	Hey, Nicky, he's got Pirellis in the front and Michelins in the rear.
439	00:34:49	00:34:54	Consistent with the tire treads found at the Justine Stefani murder scene.
440	00:34:54	00:34:56	That's great but unfortunately, his shoes were not.
441	00:34:56	00:34:58	None of these treads match.
442	00:34:58	00:35:01	So, Curtis must've been the wheel man.
443	00:35:01	00:35:03	At least we got half the team that killed Ian and Justine.
444	00:35:04	00:35:09	Yeah, it's the half that's out there walking around that I'm worried about.
445	00:35:09	00:35:14	So, six months ago, Shoe Print Man kills Gerald Tolliver, an accomplice of the Dick and Jane Killer.
446	00:35:14	00:35:25	And then, five weeks ago, Shoe Print, along with Curtis Keesey, abducts and kills a couple in what appears to be a botched DJK-style murder.
447	00:35:25	00:35:31	Can we connect Shoe Print with the murder of Curtis Keesey?
448	00:35:31	00:35:32	There's no physical evidence.
449	00:35:32	00:35:37	But we do know that Curtis scalped his vics' concert tickets, which isn't too bright.
450	00:35:37	00:35:39	Reason enough for one crook to kill another.
451	00:35:39	00:35:44	So, let's assume that Shoe Print was involved in all four murders.
452	00:35:44	00:35:46	It's possible he knew Gerald, right?
453	00:35:46	00:35:49	Is it also possible that he was an accomplice of DJK?
454	00:35:49	00:35:54	That would explain the nine post-mortem stab wounds in Ian Wallace.
455	00:35:54	00:35:56	It's a continuation of the master's work.
456	00:35:56	00:36:03	But if he was DJK's helper back in the day, why go quiet for ten years and then suddenly start killing again?
457	00:36:03	00:36:05	Maybe he was doing time.
458	00:36:05	00:36:12	And when he realized that his old partner turned informant, he got scared and killed him.
459	00:36:12	00:36:14	Maybe that's what brought the old thrill back.
460	00:36:14	00:36:17	Once these guys get a taste, it never seems to go away.
461	00:36:19	00:36:21	So, we've been talking a lot about how you did what you did.
462	00:36:21	00:36:24	Let's shift gears from what you did right, to what you did wrong.
463	00:36:24	00:36:26	Do you mean in a Ten Commandments sense?
464	00:36:26	00:36:28	I mean in how you got caught.
465	00:36:28	00:36:30	That's the least exciting part of the story.
466	00:36:30	00:36:32	Yeah, but didn't you want it?
467	00:36:32	00:36:33	Didn't you want to get caught?
468	00:36:33	00:36:35	Why would I want that?
469	00:36:35	00:36:40	You were caught because a rookie patrolman spotted blood on your car, correct?
470	00:36:40	00:36:43	For a careful man, that seems a little careless.
471	00:36:43	00:36:45	Everybody makes mistakes.
472	00:36:45	00:36:46	Not someone like you.
473	00:36:46	00:36:48	Not a mistake like that.
474	00:36:48	00:36:50	I'm flattered you think so highly of me.
475	00:36:50	00:36:52	Any other questions? Anybody else?
476	00:36:52	00:36:55	Mr. Haskell, you're of average height and weight.
477	00:36:55	00:36:57	And not overly muscular.
478	00:36:57	00:36:59	I try to watch what I eat.
479	00:36:59	00:37:01	In jail, that takes more strength than you would know.
480	00:37:01	00:37:05	A few of your male victims were pretty big.
481	00:37:05	00:37:07	One even played college football.
482	00:37:07	00:37:12	How were you able to overpower a man like that, while still keeping control of the woman?
483	00:37:12	00:37:14	Why don't you tell me, Professor?
484	00:37:14	00:37:16	You obviously have a theory.
485	00:37:16	00:37:18	Well, I think you must've had help.
486	00:37:18	00:37:21	The works of great men can be hard to comprehend for those less great.
487	00:37:21	00:37:23	You said you were going to be honest with us.
488	00:37:23	00:37:26	Now, answer the question. Did you have help or not?
489	00:37:26	00:37:28	Well, let me think.
490	00:37:28	00:37:31	With Melanie, it was just me and the baseball bat.
491	00:37:31	00:37:36	With Kristin, when I cut off her right breast, that was just me.
492	00:37:36	00:37:47	When I crushed Joel's neck and felt his veins burst under my fingers like rotten grapes, and watched his throat fill up with blood, I didn't have any help there, either.
493	00:37:47	00:37:49	Where is he, you monster!
494	00:37:49	00:37:50	Where is my Joel? Where is he?!
495	00:37:51	00:37:53	Oh, I think I hit a nerve.
496	00:37:53	00:37:54	You tell me where he is!
497	00:37:54	00:37:57	Can I think about that and get back to you?
498	00:37:57	00:38:00	Okay, I thought about it, I'm not going to tell you.
499	00:38:00	00:38:01	Oh, please tell me...
500	00:38:01	00:38:02	Don't give him the satisfaction.
501	00:38:04	00:38:08	Joel was the first.
502	00:38:09	00:38:11	Joel is in the perfect place, the place where it all began.
503	00:38:11	00:38:14	And if I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company.
504	00:38:14	00:38:18	Mr. Haskell, we know that you had accomplices.
505	00:38:18	00:38:22	If you were to reveal who they were, it might get you out of keep-away.
506	00:38:22	00:38:29	Oh, how nice that we have a member of the law enforcement community with us today.
507	00:38:29	00:38:35	For you real students who don't know, keep-away is what they call the kind of solitary confinement I'm in.
508	00:38:35	00:38:36	Kill the feed.
509	00:38:36	00:38:48	It's kind of funny, don't you-- You hijacked my class without my consent for your investigation?!
510	00:38:48	00:38:50	We're working a multiple homicide.
511	00:38:50	00:38:52	We didn't want to talk about it outside the department.
512	00:38:52	00:38:54	You talked to the Dean.
513	00:38:54	00:38:58	Well, it was on a need-to-know basis and he had a need to know.
514	00:38:58	00:39:03	Look, I don't teach this course because I get off on the subject matter.
515	00:39:03	00:39:06	If there's another DJK out there, I want him just as bad as you do. I would've helped.
516	00:39:06	00:39:07	I would've been happy to help you.
517	00:39:07	00:39:09	I'm sure that's true.
518	00:39:09	00:39:12	You believe DJK had an accomplice?
519	00:39:12	00:39:14	I do.
520	00:39:14	00:39:15	Do you have a name?
521	00:39:15	00:39:17	Not yet.
522	00:39:17	00:39:18	Okay, now we're all up to speed.
523	00:39:18	00:39:20	Doctor...
524	00:39:20	00:39:23	I will keep you informed.
525	00:39:23	00:39:25	To the extent that we can.
526	00:39:25	00:39:28	Thanks. I know a kiss-off when I hear one.
527	00:39:28	00:39:31	A little cranky for an academic, isn't he?
528	00:39:31	00:39:35	Actually, he's an M.D. from back East.
529	00:39:35	00:39:39	A colleague at his hospital turned out to be an Angel of Death.
530	00:39:39	00:39:41	Killed 27 patients before he was caught.
531	00:39:41	00:39:44	Langston was the staff research pathologist.
532	00:39:44	00:39:49	All the morbidity evidence came across his desk, but he was unable to connect the dots.
533	00:39:49	00:39:51	He wrote a book about it. Any good?
534	00:39:51	00:39:53	I liked it.
535	00:40:00	00:40:01	This is Langston.
536	00:40:01	00:40:05	Working late? I kind of thought you might be.
537	00:40:05	00:40:06	Haskell.
538	00:40:06	00:40:10	Uh-huh. This must be my lucky night.
539	00:40:10	00:40:13	Maybe it's yours, too.
540	00:40:13	00:40:15	What do you want?
541	00:40:15	00:40:18	I want you to look out the window.
542	00:40:18	00:40:20	Why?
543	00:40:20	00:40:23	Because I'm in the parking lot.
544	00:40:36	00:40:40	I made you look.
545	00:40:40	00:40:41	Is that why you called?
546	00:40:42	00:40:48	No, I wanted to talk to you about what happened in class today-- with Mrs. Steiner.
547	00:40:48	00:40:51	Sure, just, uh, hold on a second.
548	00:40:51	00:40:54	Let me close the door.
549	00:41:04	00:41:06	Grissom.
550	00:41:06	00:41:09	Ray Langston. I have Nate Haskell on the phone.
551	00:41:09	00:41:11	He wants to talk about what happened with Mrs. Steiner.
552	00:41:11	00:41:13	I'd like to put you on the other line.
553	00:41:13	00:41:15	Go ahead.
554	00:41:17	00:41:19	Haskell, are you there?
555	00:41:19	00:41:21	I'm sure we're all here now.
556	00:41:21	00:41:32	What I learned in class today, as I was looking out at all those scared little faces who couldn't take their eyes off of me, was how much I miss being out in the world.
557	00:41:32	00:41:40	And when Mrs. Steiner had her moment, it got me thinking about... closure.
558	00:41:40	00:41:46	Which is what you'll find at the corner of Boulder Highway and Hasbrook.
559	00:41:46	00:41:49	It's just another empty stretch of desert out there.
560	00:41:49	00:41:53	At least it was ten years ago.
561	00:41:53	00:41:58	The way this city's changed, it's maybe all different now.
562	00:41:58	00:42:01	Although, maybe not.
563	00:42:01	00:42:03	It's kind of an ugly place.
564	00:42:03	00:42:08	Anyway, it's just the same in my imagination.
565	00:42:08	00:42:12	There's a concrete bridge built in 1938.
566	00:42:12	00:42:17	You can tell because the year is stamped in the front.
567	00:42:17	00:42:22	25 feet from that, look west.
568	00:42:22	00:42:29	You'll see one dark stone that just doesn't quit fit with the rest.
569	00:42:30	00:42:33	Under there...
570	00:42:33	00:42:36	that's where you'll find Joel.
571	00:42:40	00:42:43	And if we're lucky, maybe something else.
572	00:42:43	00:42:45	Grissom, we got something here!
573	00:42:54	00:42:57	Because that's the problem with closure.
574	00:42:57	00:43:04	Sometimes when something closes, something else opens up.
575	00:43:09	00:43:11	Guess you won't be leaving just yet.
