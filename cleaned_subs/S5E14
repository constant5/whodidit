0,00:00:09,00:00:11,BRASS: BOLO out on the vehicle.
1,00:00:11,00:00:14,Missing Persons: Lori Kyman.
2,00:00:14,00:00:18,"Husband said she went out with some girlfriends earlier this evening, and never came home."
3,00:00:18,00:00:19,CURTIS: FOS.
4,00:00:19,00:00:20,What's an FOS?
5,00:00:20,00:00:22,Friend of the sheriff.
6,00:00:22,00:00:25,How else do you get listed as a missing person so quickly?
7,00:00:29,00:00:30,Doors are locked.
8,00:00:30,00:00:31,No key in the ignition.
9,00:00:34,00:00:36,No sign of struggle or foul play.
10,00:00:36,00:00:38,Flat tire.
11,00:00:38,00:00:40,Couple of smudges.
12,00:00:40,00:00:42,"Okay, pop it."
13,00:00:48,00:00:50,"So, she gets a flat."
14,00:00:50,00:00:53,There's no gas station around.
15,00:00:53,00:00:56,"It's a Lexus, so there's no On‐Star."
16,00:00:56,00:00:58,She must have had some kind of emergency roadside service.
17,00:00:58,00:01:00,BRASS: I ran her cell phone log.
18,00:01:00,00:01:02,She made one call to her husband at 9:30.
19,00:01:02,00:01:04,Said she was coming home at 11:00; that's it.
20,00:01:04,00:01:09,Maybe some good Samaritan offered her a lift.
21,00:01:09,00:01:13,"Yeah, and evidently didn't take her where she wanted to go."
22,00:01:46,00:01:48,Lori hadn't gotten out much since Joey was born.
23,00:01:48,00:01:52,"She needed some time away from the baby, and from me."
24,00:01:52,00:01:54,Girls' night out.
25,00:01:54,00:01:56,We've been best friends since high school.
26,00:01:56,00:01:58,Where'd you go?
27,00:01:58,00:02:00,The Top Floor.
28,00:02:00,00:02:03,That's right next to O'Shea's.
29,00:02:03,00:02:07,"Amy, why don't you and I go into the other room? Okay."
30,00:02:07,00:02:09,He's going to need his bottle soon.
31,00:02:09,00:02:11,I'll take care of it.
32,00:02:11,00:02:15,"So, Mark, you were home alone with the baby last night?"
33,00:02:15,00:02:18,"No. Uh, I, uh, I manage the steakhouse at the Tangiers."
34,00:02:18,00:02:19,I got home around 9:00.
35,00:02:19,00:02:22,My mother‐in‐law was taking care of Joey.
36,00:02:22,00:02:23,Your mother‐in‐law.
37,00:02:23,00:02:24,I'll need to speak with her.
38,00:02:24,00:02:26,"Yeah, she's on her way over."
39,00:02:26,00:02:28,(baby cooing)
40,00:02:28,00:02:30,She's in love with her baby.
41,00:02:30,00:02:32,She wouldn't go anywhere without him.
42,00:02:32,00:02:33,What about Mark?
43,00:02:33,00:02:34,Mark loves Lori.
44,00:02:34,00:02:36,He would never hurt her.
45,00:02:36,00:02:39,"When a wife disappears, it's protocol to look at the husband."
46,00:02:39,00:02:41,(sighing)
47,00:02:41,00:02:44,I promised I would never say anything.
48,00:02:44,00:02:48,"Before the baby was born, she suspected he was cheating."
49,00:02:48,00:02:52,"But then Joey came, and last night at the club, Lori said things were great."
50,00:02:52,00:02:54,Did anything unusual happen last night?
51,00:02:54,00:02:55,(cooing)
52,00:02:55,00:02:58,There was this one guy who kept moving in on Lori.
53,00:02:58,00:03:00,Hi. Could I ask you a question?
54,00:03:01,00:03:02,It's critical.
55,00:03:02,00:03:03,Okay.
56,00:03:03,00:03:04,Am I your type?
57,00:03:04,00:03:06,I'm married.
58,00:03:06,00:03:07,"Oh, yeah?"
59,00:03:07,00:03:08,Nice try.
60,00:03:09,00:03:10,Ring.
61,00:03:11,00:03:13,I think his name is Brad.
62,00:03:14,00:03:16,Does Lori always go out without a ring?
63,00:03:16,00:03:17,She had lost some weight.
64,00:03:17,00:03:19,It was being resized.
65,00:03:19,00:03:23,"BRASS: So, Lori calls you at 9:30 to check on the baby."
66,00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah. Said she missed him.
67,00:03:25,00:03:26,Said she was going to be home at 11:00.
68,00:03:26,00:03:31,"I, uh, passed out on the couch waiting for her."
69,00:03:31,00:03:33,We stopped drinking at 10:00.
70,00:03:33,00:03:35,Left about an hour later.
71,00:03:35,00:03:37,What about the guy‐‐ Brad?
72,00:03:37,00:03:39,He didn't get the hint.
73,00:03:43,00:03:45,He seemed harmless.
74,00:03:45,00:03:48,Horny... but harmless.
75,00:03:48,00:03:51,"I, uh, I woke up, must have been about 2:00."
76,00:03:51,00:03:53,I called her on her cell.
77,00:03:53,00:03:54,No answer.
78,00:03:54,00:03:56,And then I called Amy.
79,00:03:58,00:04:01,And then I called you guys.
80,00:04:01,00:04:03,"So, you haven't left the house since you got home last night?"
81,00:04:03,00:04:06,"We, uh, only have one car right now."
82,00:04:06,00:04:07,My lease ran out.
83,00:04:08,00:04:09,Any news?
84,00:04:13,00:04:16,They found her car off Boulder Highway.
85,00:04:17,00:04:18,"Oh, my God."
86,00:04:20,00:04:22,"This is Diane, Lori's mom. Hi."
87,00:04:22,00:04:26,"Diane, I want you to know we have every available officer out looking for your daughter."
88,00:04:26,00:04:27,Thank you.
89,00:04:27,00:04:28,Where's Joey?
90,00:04:28,00:04:30,He's with Amy.
91,00:04:30,00:04:31,Okay.
92,00:04:31,00:04:33,"You know, I just got a quick couple of questions."
93,00:04:33,00:04:37,Can you confirm you were here last night when Mark came home from work?
94,00:04:37,00:04:38,Yes. I was baby‐sitting.
95,00:04:38,00:04:39,What time was that?
96,00:04:39,00:04:42,Uh... I'd just put Joey down.
97,00:04:42,00:04:44,A little after 9:00.
98,00:04:44,00:04:45,And when did your daughter call?
99,00:04:45,00:04:47,About half an hour later.
100,00:04:47,00:04:48,We both talked to her.
101,00:04:48,00:04:49,BRASS: 9:30. Thanks.
102,00:04:49,00:04:51,"That's all for now, thank you."
103,00:04:51,00:04:52,Excuse me.
104,00:04:53,00:04:55,What do I do?
105,00:04:55,00:04:57,"I'd take care of your family, Mark."
106,00:04:57,00:05:02,"And if Ms. Sidle asks, volunteer your fingerprints and DNA."
107,00:05:04,00:05:09,RANGER: I was making my 16:45 scan when I saw the body.
108,00:05:09,00:05:11,I confirmed he was deceased.
109,00:05:11,00:05:13,Then I called you guys.
110,00:05:13,00:05:15,Hey.
111,00:05:15,00:05:16,There's no ID on the vic.
112,00:05:16,00:05:18,Lividity is set.
113,00:05:18,00:05:20,Rigidity is still present.
114,00:05:20,00:05:22,Dead no more than 24 hours.
115,00:05:22,00:05:24,WARRICK: Look at those claw marks.
116,00:05:24,00:05:26,His carotid artery is ripped to shreds.
117,00:05:26,00:05:29,He's got a high‐powered rifle.
118,00:05:31,00:05:33,"He's obviously a hunter, huh?"
119,00:05:33,00:05:34,Safe to say he was mauled by a wild animal?
120,00:05:35,00:05:36,Yeah.
121,00:05:36,00:05:40,"Your call came in as ""suspicious circs."" Is there something else we should know about?"
122,00:05:40,00:05:42,"Yeah, that would be the other body."
123,00:05:42,00:05:43,Follow me.
124,00:05:49,00:05:51,Damn.
125,00:05:51,00:05:52,It's a Kodiak.
126,00:05:53,00:05:55,It's nonnative to the continental US.
127,00:05:55,00:06:00,Shot twice in the head.
128,00:06:00,00:06:01,The stomach's been cut open.
129,00:06:03,00:06:05,WARRICK: That's a pretty deep cut.
130,00:06:05,00:06:08,You think the hunter was just trying to defend himself?
131,00:06:08,00:06:10,I didn't find a blade on the decedent.
132,00:06:10,00:06:13,And there's no way a person can come this close to a live bear.
133,00:06:14,00:06:16,STOKES: Got some broken branches over here.
134,00:06:18,00:06:22,Directionality faces away from the victim and the animal.
135,00:06:26,00:06:28,Looks like someone even tore their pants.
136,00:06:28,00:06:30,Khakis.
137,00:06:30,00:06:32,Vic's wearing jeans and a nylon vest.
138,00:06:32,00:06:37,"I bet somebody else was out here, and they were running for their life."
139,00:06:39,00:06:41,I had to see with my own eyes.
140,00:06:41,00:06:44,You're actually autopsying a bear.
141,00:06:44,00:06:45,It's called a necropsy.
142,00:06:45,00:06:48,"And as the head ME, it falls under my purview."
143,00:06:48,00:06:50,I'll write an article for the journal.
144,00:06:50,00:06:51,They love this sort of stuff.
145,00:06:52,00:06:55,Yeah. You have a cause of death on him?
146,00:06:55,00:06:57,I can confirm he was killed by an angry bear.
147,00:07:00,00:07:03,As for the bear‐‐ two bullets to the head.
148,00:07:03,00:07:06,"The first, nonfatal, was a straight‐on shot."
149,00:07:07,00:07:17,"Bears' foreheads are sloped, so the bullet ricocheted off the skull, leaving a copper jacket, which peeled away and embedded in the hide."
150,00:07:18,00:07:23,"The, uh, fatal bullet entered through the ear, lodged in the brain."
151,00:07:23,00:07:24,I removed it already.
152,00:07:24,00:07:25,WILLOWS: It's lead.
153,00:07:25,00:07:27,No copper jacket.
154,00:07:27,00:07:30,"So, the copper jacket had to have come from his rifle."
155,00:07:30,00:07:33,But this is from a handgun.
156,00:07:33,00:07:36,"So, he shot one bullet with his rifle and another with his pistol."
157,00:07:36,00:07:38,Except he didn't have a pistol.
158,00:07:38,00:07:39,"Or a knife, for that matter."
159,00:07:39,00:07:42,And his stomach has been slashed open.
160,00:07:42,00:07:45,"Yeah, and the gallbladder removed."
161,00:07:45,00:07:46,Really?
162,00:07:46,00:07:48,Postmortem.
163,00:07:48,00:07:49,I can't tell you why.
164,00:08:23,00:08:25,Hey. I ran the vic's prints.
165,00:08:25,00:08:26,Didn't get a hit.
166,00:08:26,00:08:29,We found this guy 25 miles from civilization.
167,00:08:29,00:08:30,Where'd he come from?
168,00:08:30,00:08:32,We know someone else was out there.
169,00:08:32,00:08:33,Maybe he drove.
170,00:08:35,00:08:38,Check out this guy's watch.
171,00:08:38,00:08:41,It's pretty high‐end.
172,00:08:41,00:08:45,Yeah. Hunting's not exactly a poor man's sport.
173,00:08:45,00:08:47,US presidents still hold up dead ducks for photo ops.
174,00:08:48,00:08:50,But it just doesn't match with the guy's clothes.
175,00:08:50,00:08:51,They're kind of raggedy.
176,00:08:51,00:08:52,He's got dirt stains.
177,00:08:52,00:08:54,I could smell the BO from the guy's shirt from here.
178,00:08:54,00:08:58,Some hunters think soap and deodorant tip off their prey.
179,00:08:58,00:09:00,"Truth is, body odor's much more pungent."
180,00:09:00,00:09:04,"So, Robbins confirmed that our vic was killed by the bear."
181,00:09:05,00:09:06,Okay. Case closed.
182,00:09:06,00:09:08,"Uh, not quite."
183,00:09:08,00:09:09,I spoke with the ranger.
184,00:09:10,00:09:15,"There's no way that a Kodiak bear just wanders into Nevada, so whoever smuggled him in could be charged with homicide."
185,00:09:15,00:09:16,How's that?
186,00:09:16,00:09:19,The bear could be considered a lethal weapon.
187,00:09:22,00:09:24,Screw.
188,00:09:24,00:09:26,Excuse me?
189,00:09:26,00:09:27,Tire's valve stem was unscrewed.
190,00:09:28,00:09:29,Two full turns.
191,00:09:29,00:09:31,A slow leaker.
192,00:09:31,00:09:34,Print around the fender.
193,00:10:07,00:10:08,"Yeah, I was at the Top Floor."
194,00:10:08,00:10:09,I hit on a lot of girls.
195,00:10:09,00:10:11,"You can't arrest me for that, right?"
196,00:10:11,00:10:13,BRASS: Tell us about Lori Kyman.
197,00:10:13,00:10:16,"Yeah, I remember a Lori."
198,00:10:16,00:10:17,(laughs)
199,00:10:18,00:10:19,Said she was married.
200,00:10:19,00:10:20,"Yeah, right."
201,00:10:20,00:10:22,You dress up like that and go to a club...
202,00:10:22,00:10:23,(clicks tongue)
203,00:10:23,00:10:24,...you're looking to get some.
204,00:10:24,00:10:27,I found your fingerprints on her car's fender.
205,00:10:27,00:10:30,So? I walked her back to her car.
206,00:10:30,00:10:31,I am a gentleman.
207,00:10:31,00:10:34,Is that when you messed with her tire?
208,00:10:34,00:10:37,Is that what this is about?
209,00:10:37,00:10:38,I don't get out much.
210,00:10:38,00:10:39,Why would you do that?
211,00:10:39,00:10:43,"I was hoping it would go flat on her way back home, and I'd come along and fix it for her."
212,00:10:43,00:10:48,"And then she'd be appropriately grateful, and what, sleep with you?"
213,00:10:48,00:10:51,"Seemed like a good idea at the time, yeah."
214,00:10:51,00:10:52,'Course I was tanked.
215,00:10:53,00:10:54,"Okay, so Lori's tire went flat."
216,00:10:54,00:10:55,That's the thing: it didn't.
217,00:10:55,00:10:58,"I mean, I followed her for like 20 minutes."
218,00:10:58,00:10:59,Way off Strip.
219,00:10:59,00:11:02,"And, come on, how long can you follow someone for, right?"
220,00:11:02,00:11:03,She never made it home.
221,00:11:05,00:11:07,I don't know anything about that.
222,00:11:07,00:11:09,We're going to need a sample of your DNA.
223,00:11:10,00:11:10,Any objections?
224,00:11:11,00:11:12,Excuse me.
225,00:11:12,00:11:13,"Excuse me, Captain."
226,00:11:14,00:11:15,Found a dead female in Sutor.
227,00:11:15,00:11:19,Description matches Lori Kyman.
228,00:11:22,00:11:23,Make yourself comfortable.
229,00:11:31,00:11:34,Guy walking his dog found her.
230,00:11:39,00:11:41,EXAMINER: Liver temp's 71 degrees.
231,00:11:42,00:11:48,"Given the ambient temperature, her TOD's is roughly between 36 to 40 hours ago."
232,00:11:55,00:12:00,Bruises on the neck suggest strangulation.
233,00:12:06,00:12:08,No attempt to hide the body.
234,00:12:08,00:12:10,Maybe the suspect was in a hurry.
235,00:12:11,00:12:14,Or he just didn't give a damn.
236,00:12:14,00:12:16,Are you gonna tell the family?
237,00:12:16,00:12:20,"Yeah, how do you tell a little boy he'll never know his mother?"
238,00:12:24,00:12:27,She was dumped under a white birch.
239,00:12:27,00:12:30,Her hair is full of pods and tree vegetation.
240,00:12:43,00:12:45,Red fibers and blue fibers on her dress.
241,00:12:53,00:12:56,White powder on both palms.
242,00:13:06,00:13:10,A brown hair with a follicular tag.
243,00:13:12,00:13:18,A person's entire identity balled up in a few nanograms of matter.
244,00:13:18,00:13:22,Assuming one's identity can be wholly quantified by our DNA.
245,00:13:22,00:13:23,"Well, genetically, it can."
246,00:13:24,00:13:26,We're completely programmed as soon as the sperm hits the egg.
247,00:13:27,00:13:30,So we're defined at a cellular level?
248,00:13:30,00:13:31,More or less.
249,00:13:31,00:13:32,No.
250,00:13:32,00:13:35,Identity is the totality of our life experiences.
251,00:13:35,00:13:40,And our brain neurons process our relationship to the world and each other.
252,00:13:40,00:13:42,(camera clicks) I stand corrected.
253,00:13:42,00:13:45,"DNA is what we are, not who we are."
254,00:13:45,00:13:47,What we are never changes.
255,00:13:47,00:13:49,Who we are never stops changing.
256,00:13:49,00:13:51,Yeah. Whether we like it or not.
257,00:13:52,00:13:53,(camera clicks)
258,00:13:53,00:13:54,What's up?
259,00:13:54,00:13:59,"Well, when I fluoroscoped the bear, looking for other bullets, I noticed a microchip between his shoulder blades."
260,00:13:59,00:14:01,WILLOWS: I see.
261,00:14:01,00:14:04,"I removed it, called Animal Control to borrow a magnetic reader."
262,00:14:04,00:14:05,Check it out.
263,00:14:08,00:14:10,(beeping)
264,00:14:10,00:14:12,I tracked it down: Clark County Zoo.
265,00:14:21,00:14:24,MAN: Are you sure the bear came from our zoo?
266,00:14:24,00:14:26,"Well, the microchip was registered to you."
267,00:14:26,00:14:27,Take a look.
268,00:14:27,00:14:29,"Oh, God."
269,00:14:29,00:14:31,It's Tippy.
270,00:14:31,00:14:32,What happened?
271,00:14:32,00:14:35,You mean you didn't know he was missing?
272,00:14:35,00:14:36,We sold him to a broker a few weeks ago.
273,00:14:36,00:14:38,He said he found him a home at the Columbus Zoo.
274,00:14:38,00:14:40,A broker? Animal broker.
275,00:14:40,00:14:41,Visitors want to see babies.
276,00:14:41,00:14:45,The brokers find other zoos to purchase our surplus adult animals.
277,00:14:47,00:14:50,"You know, Tippy was so gentle, he'd eat grapes right out of my hand."
278,00:14:50,00:14:52,"Well, we're going to need to see some paperwork."
279,00:14:52,00:14:54,"Yeah, I'll pull the file, but..."
280,00:14:54,00:14:55,I remember the broker's name.
281,00:14:56,00:14:57,It's Ken Bovitz.
282,00:14:57,00:14:57,Out of Chicago.
283,00:14:58,00:15:00,He mailed me his broker's license and documentation.
284,00:15:00,00:15:02,The board approved the sale last fall.
285,00:15:02,00:15:05,(sighs): They'll want to know what went wrong.
286,00:15:05,00:15:07,"Yeah, so do we."
287,00:15:07,00:15:10,SANDERS: You giving the car a workout?
288,00:15:10,00:15:15,"Well, you know how you said that the suspect admitted to following Lori, but when the tire didn't go flat, he gave up?"
289,00:15:15,00:15:17,Grissom wants me to disprove his account.
290,00:15:17,00:15:20,How long has the wheel been going round and round?
291,00:15:20,00:15:23,Three hours and nine minutes.
292,00:15:23,00:15:25,She left the club around 11:00.
293,00:15:26,00:15:29,Time of death was between midnight and 1:00 a. m.
294,00:15:29,00:15:31,Lori died before the tire went flat.
295,00:15:33,00:15:36,WARRICK: I think I know why someone snagged that bear's gallbladder.
296,00:15:36,00:15:42,"Apparently, in the southeast Asian community, some men believe it enhances their virility."
297,00:15:42,00:15:46,It contains some chemical called ursodeoxycholic acid.
298,00:15:46,00:15:49,These gallbladders are going for $500 a pop.
299,00:15:49,00:15:51,"I, uh, talked to the zoo in Columbus."
300,00:15:51,00:15:52,They never heard of Tippy.
301,00:15:52,00:15:54,Hmm. Any luck with the broker?
302,00:15:54,00:15:58,The Department of Agriculture never issued a license for a Ken Bovitz.
303,00:15:58,00:15:59,Documents are fake.
304,00:16:00,00:16:02,I sent them to QD for analysis.
305,00:16:03,00:16:05,We may have an ID on our hunter.
306,00:16:05,00:16:07,Uniforms found an abandoned Mercedes.
307,00:16:07,00:16:15,"Plates came back to a Mr. Ron Hollis, who had hunting permits that included tags for wild goats, deer, and bighorn sheep."
308,00:16:15,00:16:16,And what about Kodiaks?
309,00:16:16,00:16:17,That would be a no.
310,00:16:18,00:16:23,"Mr. Hollis's wife's on her way to PD, so I'm gonna head over there right now."
311,00:16:23,00:16:27,"To be honest, I haven't seen my husband in over a year."
312,00:16:27,00:16:28,STOKES: You were separated?
313,00:16:28,00:16:31,He made it big in venture capital.
314,00:16:31,00:16:32,Retired at 32.
315,00:16:32,00:16:36,That's when we started having problems.
316,00:16:36,00:16:38,The officer said Rod died while hunting.
317,00:16:38,00:16:40,Can I ask what happened?
318,00:16:40,00:16:43,He was mauled by a bear.
319,00:16:43,00:16:48,"Ms. Hollis, I have reason to believe there was somebody else out there with him."
320,00:16:48,00:16:49,Any idea who?
321,00:16:49,00:16:51,No.
322,00:16:51,00:16:54,"In our circle of friends, he was the only one who owned a gun."
323,00:16:55,00:16:57,We used to fight about his sport.
324,00:16:57,00:17:03,"I showed him studies about how the animals suffer, how even the best hunters don't always get center shots."
325,00:17:03,00:17:08,Well... I guess brutality begets brutality.
326,00:17:11,00:17:14,ROBBINS: COD is asphyxia due to manual strangulation.
327,00:17:14,00:17:20,Petechiae in the eyes and mouth and extensive bruising in the strap muscles of the neck.
328,00:17:20,00:17:21,Sexual assault?
329,00:17:21,00:17:23,No abrasions or contusions to the vagina.
330,00:17:24,00:17:25,No semen on the SART exam.
331,00:17:29,00:17:30,Is this a burn?
332,00:17:31,00:17:32,No tissue reaction means it's post‐mortem.
333,00:17:34,00:17:37,"If she were alive at the time, it'd have a red edge."
334,00:17:37,00:17:38,This one's bland.
335,00:17:38,00:17:42,"Burn extends subcutaneously, so the skin made contact with something hotter than 150 degrees."
336,00:17:45,00:17:47,"Talk to me, Hodges."
337,00:17:47,00:17:50,"Well, you kind of inundated me with work."
338,00:17:50,00:17:52,I should be cranky.
339,00:17:52,00:17:53,"But, uh, I don't get cranky."
340,00:17:53,00:17:56,Let's start with the white powder you found on your victim's bands.
341,00:17:56,00:17:58,It's talcum power without the talc.
342,00:17:58,00:18:01,Excuse me? Talcum powder can contain asbestos fibers.
343,00:18:01,00:18:03,Who wants to put asbestos on their baby?
344,00:18:03,00:18:07,"So, today's baby powders are made from cornstarch, and are technically talc‐free."
345,00:18:07,00:18:09,Did your victim have her baby with her at the club?
346,00:18:09,00:18:11,"No, he was at home."
347,00:18:11,00:18:14,So maybe the baby powder was on her hands when she left the house.
348,00:18:14,00:18:17,"Well, we know she was drinking, so she was probably peeing."
349,00:18:17,00:18:23,"And unlike some of the men in this lab, whose initials are Greg Sanders, she probably washes her hands."
350,00:18:23,00:18:25,So the baby powder shouldn't even be there.
351,00:18:25,00:18:28,Tell me about the fibers we collected from her clothing.
352,00:18:28,00:18:33,Blue ones have a high twist rate and are composed of nylon and polyester olefins.
353,00:18:33,00:18:35,I'd say synthetic Berber.
354,00:18:35,00:18:38,And the red ones are under the scope.
355,00:18:42,00:18:43,CURTIS: Trilobal.
356,00:18:44,00:18:45,From a car.
357,00:18:46,00:18:48,Vic's clothing was covered in them.
358,00:18:48,00:18:50,"My guess, she was rolling around in someone's trunk."
359,00:18:53,00:18:55,Can you be more specific?
360,00:18:55,00:18:57,You bet.
361,00:18:57,00:18:58,It's Wilton wool.
362,00:18:58,00:18:59,Very high‐end.
363,00:18:59,00:19:06,"And given the unique shade of red, I'd say that you're looking at the world's fastest four‐seat coupe: the Bentley Continental GT."
364,00:19:08,00:19:09,Thank you.
365,00:19:16,00:19:18,"MAN: Yeah, I was here last night."
366,00:19:18,00:19:20,CURTIS: You park a Bentley?
367,00:19:21,00:19:24,"Oh, man, my memory's not so good since, um..."
368,00:19:25,00:19:28,"Well, I can't really remember."
369,00:19:28,00:19:29,You don't remember a Bentley?
370,00:19:29,00:19:31,Let me see what I got.
371,00:19:31,00:19:33,Yeah.
372,00:19:35,00:19:38,"Yeah, here you go. One Bentley."
373,00:19:38,00:19:39,Came in at 8:32.
374,00:19:40,00:19:41,Parked it in spot 19C.
375,00:19:41,00:19:43,"Do you remember, uh, what the driver looked like?"
376,00:19:43,00:19:45,Male?
377,00:19:45,00:19:47,Female? Black? Caucasian?
378,00:19:47,00:19:49,Young? Old?
379,00:19:49,00:19:50,He have a hat on?
380,00:19:50,00:19:52,Sorry.
381,00:19:52,00:19:53,Sorry.
382,00:19:55,00:19:56,Amy.
383,00:19:56,00:19:58,Thanks for coming.
384,00:19:58,00:20:01,Of course. How can I help?
385,00:20:01,00:20:05,"The other night at the club, I was wondering if you happened to notice anyone driving a Bentley."
386,00:20:05,00:20:07,That would be me.
387,00:20:07,00:20:08,Birthday gift from my father.
388,00:20:08,00:20:11,Would you mind if I took a look at it?
389,00:20:11,00:20:13,You want to see my car?
390,00:20:13,00:20:14,Why?
391,00:20:14,00:20:17,We found fibers from a Bentley on Lori's clothing.
392,00:20:17,00:20:22,"Lori was in my car all the time, especially last week."
393,00:20:24,00:20:26,Mark was using hers.
394,00:20:26,00:20:30,The fibers we found are from the floor or a trunk.
395,00:20:35,00:20:36,It's in the lot. I'll call my father.
396,00:20:36,00:20:37,He'll pick me up.
397,00:20:38,00:20:39,Amy...
398,00:20:39,00:20:42,Did Lori use the ladies' room at the club?
399,00:20:42,00:20:43,Yeah.
400,00:20:43,00:20:45,We both did.
401,00:20:45,00:20:47,Do you know if she washed her hands?
402,00:20:47,00:20:49,Why are you asking me all these questions?
403,00:20:50,00:20:51,We're pursuing a lead.
404,00:20:53,00:20:55,Lori was like a sister to me.
405,00:20:55,00:20:59,"Investigate me all you want, but when you're done, you should take a look at Mark."
406,00:20:59,00:21:01,Mark. I thought you said...
407,00:21:01,00:21:03,I know what I said.
408,00:21:03,00:21:05,That was before she turned up dead.
409,00:21:06,00:21:07,"And I'm not saying he did it, and Lori..."
410,00:21:07,00:21:10,she never said anything.
411,00:21:11,00:21:13,"It's just sometimes, um..."
412,00:21:14,00:21:15,he can get rough.
413,00:21:15,00:21:17,(writing)
414,00:21:17,00:21:21,And you know this because...?
415,00:21:24,00:21:26,You were the other woman.
416,00:21:26,00:21:28,One of them.
417,00:21:28,00:21:30,I'm not proud of it.
418,00:21:30,00:21:32,Did Mark get rough with you?
419,00:21:33,00:21:36,That's why I ended it.
420,00:21:44,00:21:45,You started without me.
421,00:21:46,00:21:48,"Actually, I finished without you. Take a look."
422,00:21:49,00:21:50,Carpet's black.
423,00:21:51,00:21:52,Fibers on the vic's clothing were red.
424,00:21:52,00:21:55,"Obviously, we can rule out this car."
425,00:21:56,00:22:00,"I don't mean to pry, but you want to talk about what happened with you and Ecklie?"
426,00:22:00,00:22:02,Not really.
427,00:22:02,00:22:06,"I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm a good listener."
428,00:22:07,00:22:10,I blew up at Ecklie.
429,00:22:10,00:22:12,It was very unprofessional.
430,00:22:12,00:22:16,"And very satisfying, and now I'm moving on."
431,00:22:18,00:22:19,Thanks for asking.
432,00:22:22,00:22:27,"MARK: Joey just fell asleep, so please, keep your voices down."
433,00:22:27,00:22:29,All we need is a sample of baby powder.
434,00:22:36,00:22:38,"This is Berber carpet, isn't it?"
435,00:22:38,00:22:41,"Yeah, Lori thought it'd be good for a boy's room."
436,00:22:44,00:22:46,I'd like to take a small sample.
437,00:22:46,00:22:48,What's going on?
438,00:22:48,00:22:50,Just collecting evidence.
439,00:22:50,00:22:51,You're coming after me?
440,00:22:52,00:22:57,Because I've cooperated. I've let you swab my mouth and let you take my prints.
441,00:22:58,00:23:00,I love my wife. I miss her.
442,00:23:15,00:23:18,DNA from Lori's shirt came back.
443,00:23:18,00:23:20,It matches her husband.
444,00:23:20,00:23:21,That could be probative.
445,00:23:21,00:23:24,Or casual transfer unrelated to the case.
446,00:23:24,00:23:27,I also picked up your trace results.
447,00:23:29,00:23:35,Baby powder on Lori's palms is consistent with the baby powder we found at the Kymans' residence.
448,00:23:35,00:23:39,"According to her girlfriend, Lori washed her hands at the club."
449,00:23:39,00:23:43,Which suggests that Lori came home before she was killed.
450,00:23:43,00:23:45,Which contradicts the husband's account.
451,00:23:45,00:23:49,"I hate to state the obvious, but maybe the husband is lying."
452,00:23:49,00:23:53,"All right, well, let's say she came home first."
453,00:24:05,00:24:08,"Mark killed her, drove her out to Sutor, and dumped the body."
454,00:24:09,00:24:17,One problem. Mark doesn't have a car and the carpet fibers we found on Lori's clothing are inconsistent with her Lexus.
455,00:24:17,00:24:21,"Or, maybe Lori came home, she and Mark had a fight."
456,00:24:21,00:24:23,Maybe she found out he was fooling around again.
457,00:24:23,00:24:26,"She takes off, drives around."
458,00:24:26,00:24:27,Tire eventually goes flat.
459,00:24:27,00:24:31,She pulls over to the side of the road and a stranger comes along and abducts her.
460,00:24:33,00:24:35,A stranger driving a Bentley?
461,00:24:35,00:24:40,"Hey, the rich are just as deviant as the poor."
462,00:25:02,00:25:04,"Hey, Dawson."
463,00:25:04,00:25:05,Yo.
464,00:25:05,00:25:07,Any progress on those bullets?
465,00:25:07,00:25:09,"Well, the copper jacket came from your vic's rifle there."
466,00:25:09,00:25:12,"A .30‐caliber Winchester, Model 70."
467,00:25:12,00:25:13,What about the fatal bullet?
468,00:25:13,00:25:16,That came from a .357 Magnum revolver.
469,00:25:17,00:25:18,A .357?
470,00:25:18,00:25:23,Ran the baby through IBIS and get this: the gun was used in a '98 robbery.
471,00:25:23,00:25:29,The suspect was arrested but released on insufficient evidence and the gun was returned.
472,00:25:29,00:25:30,You got a name for him?
473,00:25:30,00:25:33,"Aaron Colite, from Henderson."
474,00:25:33,00:25:36,"BROWN: Why don't you just stand up by the counter, sir?"
475,00:25:37,00:25:41,Here's your warrant that we have here for your .357 Magnum revolver.
476,00:25:41,00:25:44,We know you once used it in a '98 robbery.
477,00:25:44,00:25:48,Serial number ML5684.
478,00:25:48,00:25:49,We don't want you to get it.
479,00:25:49,00:25:51,Why don't you just point and show us where it is.
480,00:25:51,00:25:52,What's this about?
481,00:25:52,00:25:54,"Where's the gun, sir?"
482,00:25:57,00:25:58,Right under the TV.
483,00:26:07,00:26:12,"Okay, Mr. Colite, this gun is going into evidence."
484,00:26:12,00:26:14,"Look, I was cleared in that robbery years ago."
485,00:26:14,00:26:18,"Well, someone killed a Kodiak bear up in the Black Mountains the day before yesterday."
486,00:26:19,00:26:21,"You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
487,00:26:21,00:26:24,"Yeah, I did. I killed it."
488,00:26:24,00:26:26,Excuse me?
489,00:26:26,00:26:28,I killed it.
490,00:26:28,00:26:31,"Look, I was... I was out hunting."
491,00:26:31,00:26:33,MAN: Help!
492,00:26:33,00:26:34,Help me!
493,00:26:34,00:26:35,Stop! Help!
494,00:26:35,00:26:36,Help me! Help!
495,00:26:36,00:26:38,Help!
496,00:26:40,00:26:44,"By the time I shot the bear, the guy was already dead."
497,00:26:45,00:26:47,You mind if I have a look around?
498,00:26:47,00:26:49,"Yeah, I do, actually."
499,00:26:49,00:26:51,You just admitted a felony of killing a bear.
500,00:26:51,00:26:52,Why didn't you report it?
501,00:26:53,00:26:56,I've been through the wringer with you guys once before.
502,00:26:56,00:26:58,I figured a guy was dead.
503,00:26:58,00:27:00,There was nothing I could do about it.
504,00:27:00,00:27:03,I took off.
505,00:27:05,00:27:06,"Look, I've got a hunting license with tags."
506,00:27:06,00:27:07,I was out hunting deer.
507,00:27:07,00:27:10,Tried to save a guy's life.
508,00:27:10,00:27:11,That's it.
509,00:27:11,00:27:12,"Whoa, Mr. Colite."
510,00:27:12,00:27:16,I just have one more question for you.
511,00:27:16,00:27:21,How long have you been storing gallbladders with your ice cream?
512,00:27:21,00:27:24,It ain't illegal to cut up a dead animal as long as it's already dead. That's the law.
513,00:27:24,00:27:26,"Could you lift your pants leg for me, please, sir?"
514,00:27:27,00:27:28,For what?
515,00:27:28,00:27:31,"Someone snagged their pant leg on a tree, probably cut themselves."
516,00:27:31,00:27:33,I wanted to see if it was you.
517,00:27:37,00:27:39,Take a look.
518,00:27:39,00:27:40,Wasn't me.
519,00:27:42,00:27:45,So Robbins sent the bear's blood to Tox.
520,00:27:45,00:27:49,It turns out there were elevated levels of Ketamine in its system.
521,00:27:49,00:27:50,Barbiturates?
522,00:27:50,00:27:52,Yeah.
523,00:27:52,00:27:54,"I think I know what's going on here, Catherine."
524,00:27:55,00:27:57,(gunshot)
525,00:28:00,00:28:02,They're called canned hunts.
526,00:28:03,00:28:04,Going on all over the country.
527,00:28:04,00:28:06,I'm sorry.
528,00:28:06,00:28:08,There's just no sport in that.
529,00:28:08,00:28:09,It's just sick.
530,00:28:09,00:28:09,"Well, you got that right."
531,00:28:09,00:28:12,"Point is, you don't have to go to Africa to hunt wild game anymore."
532,00:28:12,00:28:15,"If you've got the money, Africa comes to you."
533,00:28:15,00:28:17,And they drug the animals?
534,00:28:17,00:28:19,"To guarantee a kill, yeah."
535,00:28:19,00:28:23,"But in our case, both the hunter and the prey ended up dead."
536,00:28:23,00:28:25,Something went wrong.
537,00:28:25,00:28:26,(knocks)
538,00:28:26,00:28:29,Hey.
539,00:28:29,00:28:30,"Oh, filling out reports?"
540,00:28:31,00:28:33,They tell me it's my job.
541,00:28:34,00:28:35,You doing okay?
542,00:28:36,00:28:38,Yeah.
543,00:28:39,00:28:40,Thanks.
544,00:28:40,00:28:43,"I, uh, did a DMV search."
545,00:28:43,00:28:47,There are only five Bentleys with red interior registered in Clark County.
546,00:28:47,00:28:48,Two are leased.
547,00:28:48,00:28:50,Two are privately owned.
548,00:28:50,00:28:52,I ran the ROs. Nothing suspicious.
549,00:28:52,00:28:53,PD is following up.
550,00:28:53,00:28:54,What about the fifth one?
551,00:28:54,00:28:58,"Well, that one is owned by a boutique rental car agency."
552,00:28:58,00:28:59,I subpoenaed the rental history.
553,00:28:59,00:29:03,"Diane Hoyt, Lori's mother, had the car for the last two weeks."
554,00:29:03,00:29:06,She returned it the day after Lori disappeared.
555,00:29:06,00:29:08,Where is it now?
556,00:29:08,00:29:13,"If you've added up every cent I've made in my entire life, I still wouldn't be able to afford half this car."
557,00:29:13,00:29:14,"Yeah, but why would you want it?"
558,00:29:14,00:29:16,The insurance premiums are sky‐high.
559,00:29:16,00:29:18,"Not to mention theft, scratches."
560,00:29:18,00:29:19,It's art.
561,00:29:19,00:29:22,And I'd have every girl in the neighborhood after me.
562,00:29:22,00:29:24,Not when they saw your apartment.
563,00:29:24,00:29:25,You've been to Greg's apartment?
564,00:29:25,00:29:27,Who hasn't?
565,00:29:28,00:29:29,Red carpet.
566,00:29:30,00:29:31,Same as the interior.
567,00:29:31,00:29:33,SIDLE: Recently vacuumed.
568,00:29:33,00:29:35,We got better vacuums.
569,00:30:15,00:30:20,"You found pods in the victim's hair, right?"
570,00:30:25,00:30:27,"Same shape, size, color."
571,00:30:28,00:30:31,Too bad we can't ID this pod and tie it to that tree.
572,00:30:31,00:30:32,Who says we can't?
573,00:30:32,00:30:35,Plant DNA is no different than human DNA.
574,00:30:35,00:30:37,"In fact, a plant genome is larger."
575,00:30:37,00:30:38,I'm on it.
576,00:30:38,00:30:43,"If we can prove the pod came from that dump site, you know what that means?"
577,00:30:43,00:30:45,Lori's mother is a viable suspect.
578,00:31:33,00:31:36,Why are you asking my client about a rental car?
579,00:31:36,00:31:40,It may be probative to our investigation of her daughter's death.
580,00:31:40,00:31:41,I'll answer anything they want.
581,00:31:41,00:31:44,I backed my car into a telephone pole.
582,00:31:45,00:31:46,So I put it in the shop.
583,00:31:46,00:31:47,I had to rent a car.
584,00:31:48,00:31:50,"At a grand a day, a Bentley's a little extravagant."
585,00:31:50,00:31:52,"I mean, I usually rent a Taurus."
586,00:31:53,00:31:55,It's a fantasy car.
587,00:31:55,00:31:58,"Ever since Amy got hers, I've wanted one, so I splurged."
588,00:31:59,00:32:00,BRASS: Was the vehicle ever out of your possession?
589,00:32:01,00:32:03,"You mean, did I let anybody drive it?"
590,00:32:03,00:32:04,"That's what I mean, yeah."
591,00:32:04,00:32:06,Lori and Mark both did.
592,00:32:06,00:32:08,But I was always with them.
593,00:32:08,00:32:11,"Ms. Hoyt, did you drive your car to Sutor, Nevada?"
594,00:32:11,00:32:12,No.
595,00:32:13,00:32:15,Where are you going with this?
596,00:32:15,00:32:20,"On the hood of the vehicle, which affirmatively matched the plant material we found in Lori's hair."
597,00:32:20,00:32:22,All of which came from the same tree in Sutor.
598,00:32:22,00:32:26,"Okay, but my client returned the Bentley the day before yesterday."
599,00:32:26,00:32:31,"It was washed and then rented again, so perhaps that individual drove through Sutor on his or her way out of town."
600,00:32:31,00:32:36,"Or, as you know, that ""pod"" could be weeks or months old."
601,00:32:36,00:32:39,We also collected a number of errant hairs from the vehicle.
602,00:32:39,00:32:44,"Several are consistent with Mark and Lori's DNA and also Joey's, but not yours."
603,00:32:44,00:32:45,"Okay, I'm sorry."
604,00:32:45,00:32:48,You don't have a DNA sample of my client's for comparison purposes.
605,00:32:48,00:32:50,"No, but we have her daughter's."
606,00:32:50,00:32:53,"You're not Lori's biological mother, are you?"
607,00:32:53,00:32:55,I'm her stepmom.
608,00:32:55,00:32:57,That's not a secret.
609,00:32:58,00:33:00,I couldn't have children of my own.
610,00:33:00,00:33:06,"Ever since Lori's father died a few months ago, she's all I had."
611,00:33:06,00:33:08,"Look, Mark is devastated."
612,00:33:08,00:33:10,I really should get back to my grandson.
613,00:33:10,00:33:11,"Before you go, could we take a DNA sample?"
614,00:33:11,00:33:12,You do not have to do that.
615,00:33:13,00:33:15,"Yeah, but if she has nothing to hide, it's no big deal."
616,00:33:15,00:33:16,Could you open your mouth?
617,00:33:16,00:33:17,"All right, that's it."
618,00:33:17,00:33:19,We're finished here. Let's go.
619,00:33:24,00:33:25,What are you thinking?
620,00:33:25,00:33:27,(sighs)
621,00:33:27,00:33:31,We have nothing to arrest her on.
622,00:33:33,00:33:38,And we have unexplained evidence placing Lori back at the house after her night out.
623,00:33:38,00:33:39,That's why I like the husband.
624,00:33:39,00:33:40,Maybe they're in it together.
625,00:33:41,00:33:48,"Well, when two people of the opposite sex conspire to kill one of their partners, sex or money is almost always involved."
626,00:33:48,00:33:51,"Now, Lori's friend, Amy, did say Mark was a player."
627,00:33:51,00:33:53,"Hello, Mrs. Robinson."
628,00:33:53,00:34:00,"I had this boyfriend back in college, and when he got his first Harley, well, let's just say we sat face‐to‐face and went for a ride."
629,00:34:00,00:34:02,A Bentley is a lot more comfortable than a bike.
630,00:34:02,00:34:03,(chuckles)
631,00:34:45,00:34:53,Document was forged by taking an official license issued by the Department of Agriculture and scraping away the top layer of information.
632,00:34:53,00:34:57,"Document was then photocopied, and the bogus info was typed in."
633,00:34:57,00:34:59,Take a look.
634,00:35:00,00:35:01,WILLOWS: Mm‐hmm.
635,00:35:01,00:35:05,"A simple forgery, but it doesn't get us any closer to our suspect."
636,00:35:05,00:35:06,"Actually, it does."
637,00:35:06,00:35:17,"See, a couple years back, some photocopier companies started imbedding their machines with serial numbers less than a millimeter in size and visible only under a blue LED light."
638,00:35:17,00:35:18,Of course.
639,00:35:24,00:35:26,I see it.
640,00:35:26,00:35:27,It's as good as fingerprint.
641,00:35:28,00:35:30,Thanks.
642,00:35:36,00:35:40,TRACY: And you think the broker's documentation was forged here on my copier?
643,00:35:40,00:35:41,We know it was.
644,00:35:41,00:35:45,"Mr. Tracy, tell us about canned hunts."
645,00:35:45,00:35:50,"Uh, a wild animal is released into a controlled area where a hunter pays a fee to kill it."
646,00:35:50,00:35:53,"The promoters guarantee a trophy, so no kill, no pay."
647,00:35:54,00:35:56,They're illegal in Nevada.
648,00:35:56,00:35:57,Is that what happened to my bear?
649,00:35:57,00:35:59,"Aaron Colite worked here, right?"
650,00:36:01,00:36:02,Yeah. Maintenance.
651,00:36:02,00:36:03,You fired him?
652,00:36:03,00:36:04,About six months ago.
653,00:36:05,00:36:07,We let a lot people go. Cutbacks.
654,00:36:07,00:36:09,"Well, the evidence places Aaron at the crime scene."
655,00:36:09,00:36:14,"Wait, so you're thinking he forged the broker's document and took Tippy under false pretenses?"
656,00:36:14,00:36:16,BROWN: No. We spoke to your distributor.
657,00:36:16,00:36:19,Your copy machine was only installed two months ago.
658,00:36:19,00:36:22,We think you created the false document.
659,00:36:22,00:36:27,"We suspect that Aaron figured out a way to make a buck, and he asked for your help."
660,00:36:27,00:36:30,BROWN: So Aaron organizes this canned hunt.
661,00:36:30,00:36:33,"A few days ago, you guys meet up with Rod Hollis up at Lake Mead."
662,00:36:33,00:36:35,"Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod!"
663,00:36:36,00:36:37,Right there.
664,00:36:37,00:36:38,You see him?
665,00:36:50,00:36:51,Yes!
666,00:36:52,00:36:52,I got him!
667,00:36:52,00:36:54,"Yep, you got him."
668,00:36:54,00:37:00,"Mr. Hollis probably thought that he had killed the bear, and he raced over to claim his trophy."
669,00:37:03,00:37:03,(screaming)
670,00:37:07,00:37:09,Help! Help! Help me!
671,00:37:09,00:37:11,Help!
672,00:37:12,00:37:14,His shot only stunned the bear.
673,00:37:14,00:37:16,It was Aaron's shot that killed it.
674,00:37:17,00:37:19,You can't prove I was there.
675,00:37:19,00:37:21,"Would you lift up your pants legs, please, sir?"
676,00:37:21,00:37:22,What?
677,00:37:22,00:37:24,I have the judge on speed dial.
678,00:37:24,00:37:26,You want to save me some time here?
679,00:37:33,00:37:35,HOLLIS: Help! Help! Help me!
680,00:37:38,00:37:39,I got this gardening.
681,00:37:39,00:37:40,(laughs)
682,00:37:40,00:37:43,We subpoenaed Aaron's bank records.
683,00:37:43,00:37:47,"Rod Hollis sent Aaron a check for $16,000."
684,00:37:47,00:37:50,"Aaron sent you a check for $8,000."
685,00:37:50,00:37:52,That's a 50‐50 split.
686,00:37:52,00:37:56,You're looking at grand larceny and obtaining property under false pretenses.
687,00:37:58,00:37:59,That's about 20 years right there.
688,00:37:59,00:38:04,I'm recommending to the DA that he add another charge: second degree murder...
689,00:38:07,00:38:09,...for the death of the hunter.
690,00:38:09,00:38:11,(sighs)
691,00:38:12,00:38:18,We found your client's semen mixed with a vaginal contribution from Diane Hoyt in the back of her rental car.
692,00:38:18,00:38:21,You said you had nothing to do with Lori's murder.
693,00:38:21,00:38:22,Would you like to revise that statement?
694,00:38:22,00:38:24,No.
695,00:38:24,00:38:28,"I met Diane, uh, two weeks ago at Rain."
696,00:38:28,00:38:33,"Banged the cougar that night, but I had no idea she was anybody's mother."
697,00:38:33,00:38:35,So you haven't spoken to her since?
698,00:38:35,00:38:38,"Well, that's the whole point of banging a cougar‐‐ you never got to see 'em again."
699,00:38:38,00:38:39,One lie after another.
700,00:38:40,00:38:43,Are you questioning my client's veracity?
701,00:38:43,00:38:45,These are your client's cell phone records.
702,00:38:45,00:38:47,Semen in the car was enough to get a warrant.
703,00:38:47,00:38:54,"On the night that Lori was murdered, he called Ms. Hoyt on her cell phone at 11:23 p. m."
704,00:38:54,00:38:56,"No, I don't know him."
705,00:38:57,00:38:59,You've never seen or spoken to this man?
706,00:38:59,00:39:01,"No, not that I remember."
707,00:39:01,00:39:03,CURTIS: Hmm.
708,00:39:03,00:39:06,Do you remember the men you have sex with?
709,00:39:06,00:39:07,"Ms. Curtis, that is uncalled for."
710,00:39:07,00:39:09,SIDLE: Here's the deal.
711,00:39:09,00:39:11,Lori left the club around 11:00.
712,00:39:11,00:39:16,"By your client's own admission, he followed her for about 20 minutes, waiting for the tire to go flat."
713,00:39:16,00:39:19,"When it didn't, you called her mother."
714,00:39:20,00:39:21,It was all a setup.
715,00:39:21,00:39:26,"Brad was going to strike up a conversation with Lori at the club, and on her way home, abduct her."
716,00:39:26,00:39:31,"And then, one or both of you were going to kill her."
717,00:39:34,00:39:38,But when you got his call... you went to Plan B.
718,00:39:38,00:39:42,"I left Lori's house, drove home and went to bed."
719,00:39:42,00:39:44,You never left.
720,00:39:44,00:39:48,"Mark fell asleep in the living room, and you waited for Lori to come home."
721,00:39:54,00:39:57,(gagging)
722,00:39:57,00:40:02,"Lori's body was too heavy for you to carry, so you called for help..."
723,00:40:02,00:40:04,on Mark and Lori's phone.
724,00:40:04,00:40:08,You got her call at 1:17 a. m.
725,00:40:08,00:40:12,Coroner puts Lori's death at some time between 12:00 and 1:00 a. m.
726,00:40:12,00:40:14,"Well, which means I didn't kill her, like I told you."
727,00:40:14,00:40:15,"Brad, be quiet."
728,00:40:15,00:40:21,"Oh, I never thought you did kill her, but you did help get rid of the body, and that is conspiracy after the fact."
729,00:40:21,00:40:29,"Now, Mark would've heard something, and if he's claiming he didn't, I'd be looking at him. The living room's at the other end of the house."
730,00:40:29,00:40:30,He was asleep.
731,00:40:30,00:40:31,Prove it.
732,00:40:32,00:40:33,I don't need to.
733,00:40:33,00:40:38,We found something of Lori's on the rental exhaust pipe: her skin.
734,00:40:47,00:40:48,Your client's on record.
735,00:40:49,00:40:51,The vehicle was never out of her possession.
736,00:40:51,00:40:57,"SIDLE: You drove back to the house, picked up Lori's Lexus, drove back into town."
737,00:40:57,00:40:59,Tire went flat off Boulder Highway.
738,00:40:59,00:41:01,You can't prove that.
739,00:41:01,00:41:04,"When we suspected Brad's involvement, we printed the interior of the Lexus."
740,00:41:04,00:41:06,Your prints are on the steering wheel.
741,00:41:11,00:41:13,Is there a deal to be made?
742,00:41:14,00:41:17,Why did Diane Hoyt want Lori dead?
743,00:41:17,00:41:19,I don't know.
744,00:41:21,00:41:24,"The lady paid me 2,000 bucks."
745,00:41:24,00:41:28,Um... said she was having a fight with her daughter and wanted to make good...
746,00:41:28,00:41:32,"um, only Lori wouldn't return her calls, so it was my job to get 'em together."
747,00:41:35,00:41:39,"When she called me and asked me for my help later that night, she said she'd pay me $2,000 more."
748,00:41:44,00:41:46,I know why she did it.
749,00:41:46,00:41:49,"While you two were at PD, I called the family lawyer."
750,00:41:49,00:41:51,He faxed over a copy of Lori's father's trust.
751,00:41:52,00:41:54,Estate's worth $50 million.
752,00:41:54,00:41:56,He left it all to Lori?
753,00:41:56,00:41:57,"No, to her son."
754,00:41:57,00:42:01,Lori was the trustee with a stipend of $2.5 mil a year.
755,00:42:01,00:42:04,"If anything were to happen to Lori, guess who takes her place?"
756,00:42:04,00:42:06,Her stepmom.
757,00:42:06,00:42:07,Yup.
758,00:42:07,00:42:09,(chuckles)
759,00:42:09,00:42:12,"Listen, you guys, I'll catch up later."
760,00:42:14,00:42:18,"Hmm. She's fitting in pretty well, huh?"
761,00:42:25,00:42:29,You got a minute?
762,00:42:29,00:42:31,Sure.
763,00:42:33,00:42:36,You did a nice job on the case.
764,00:42:36,00:42:37,"I, uh..."
765,00:42:38,00:42:42,(clears throat): I just wanted you to know that I've enjoyed working with you.
766,00:42:45,00:42:47,"Well, I've enjoyed working with you as well."
767,00:42:47,00:42:51,"No, it's time I made a change."
768,00:42:51,00:42:54,I don't like the direction the lab's headed.
769,00:42:56,00:42:57,You mean Ecklie?
770,00:42:57,00:43:00,You can't pay any attention to him.
771,00:43:00,00:43:03,"No, you got a good team, but I was a supervisor."
772,00:43:03,00:43:06,"My demotion was undeserved, and every day I'm here, I'm reminded of that."
773,00:43:10,00:43:12,What?
774,00:43:13,00:43:27,"Well, someone once said, ""What we are never changes, but who we are... never stops changing."" Let's have dinner, shall we?"
