0	00:00:14	00:00:16	You’re going to like my room.
1	00:00:16	00:00:19	You can see the entire Strip from my balcony...
2	00:00:19	00:00:22	and the bed.
3	00:00:22	00:00:24	I usually don’t do this.
4	00:00:24	00:00:27	I-I mean, especially with somebody that I just met.
5	00:00:27	00:00:29	Yeah?
6	00:00:29	00:00:31	Well, I could tell that just by looking at you.
7	00:00:32	00:00:35	Uh...
8	00:00:35	00:00:37	Come on, don’t worry, all right?
9	00:00:37	00:00:40	You can trust me.
10	00:00:40	00:00:41	Okay?
11	00:00:41	00:00:43	Promise?
12	00:00:43	00:00:45	I never lie.
13	00:00:48	00:00:50	You... are so bad.
14	00:00:51	00:00:54	Yeah, I am.
15	00:01:07	00:01:08	Hey.
16	00:01:08	00:01:11	Dispatch said suspicious circs.
17	00:01:11	00:01:12	Yeah.
18	00:01:12	00:01:16	We got an anonymous call to 911 at the same time the couple found him.
19	00:01:18	00:01:21	A man has collapsed at the Devon. Hurry.
20	00:01:21	00:01:22	Where’s the man?
21	00:01:22	00:01:27	Well, he was unconscious but breathing so paramedics took him to Desert Palm Hospital.
22	00:01:27	00:01:30	There was no bullet wounds, no knife... nothing.
23	00:01:30	00:01:31	You got a name?
24	00:01:31	00:01:32	Bob Fairmont.
25	00:01:32	00:01:33	Upscale home developer.
26	00:01:33	00:01:35	A Fairmont home, you’ll never roam?
27	00:01:35	00:01:36	His billboards are everywhere.
28	00:01:36	00:01:39	They took these pictures before they moved him.
29	00:01:44	00:01:46	Well, this is as phony as a Chappaquiddick neck brace.
30	00:01:46	00:01:48	The clothes are all bunched.
31	00:01:48	00:01:52	Collar’s off to the side leg fabric’s gathered.
32	00:01:52	00:01:56	It’s impossible to redress an unconscious person to make it look like they dressed themselves.
33	00:01:56	00:01:59	You notice anything about the suit coat?
34	00:02:01	00:02:06	Well, unless he’s going to court or church there’s no way he buttons all three buttons.
35	00:02:06	00:02:08	Very good, Jim.
36	00:02:08	00:02:10	Why do they think they can fool us?
37	00:02:45	00:02:47	I’m going to go to the hospital to talk to Fairmont’s wife.
38	00:02:49	00:02:50	Call me if you learn anything.
39	00:02:50	00:02:52	Hey, guys.
40	00:02:52	00:02:55	I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant.
41	00:02:55	00:02:58	Bob Fairmont was staying in room 2927.
42	00:02:58	00:03:00	Catherine’s parking the car.
43	00:03:00	00:03:01	Let’s go up.
44	00:03:01	00:03:03	We’ll meet you there.
45	00:03:03	00:03:05	Okay.
46	00:03:12	00:03:15	Mr. Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.
47	00:03:15	00:03:16	Mmm.
48	00:03:16	00:03:17	Murder Central?
49	00:03:17	00:03:18	You never heard that phrase?
50	00:03:18	00:03:21	Well, if I did, would I have asked the question?
51	00:03:21	00:03:22	Sara, you’re with me in here.
52	00:03:22	00:03:24	You guys get the elevator.
53	00:03:25	00:03:26	All yours, girl.
54	00:03:26	00:03:28	Thanks.
55	00:03:31	00:03:35	Sara doesn’t know what Murder Central means any more than I do.
56	00:03:35	00:03:36	Oh, Nick, give it up.
57	00:03:36	00:03:39	We got a Death Imminent to worry about.
58	00:03:40	00:03:41	My husband’s in surgery.
59	00:03:41	00:03:43	Can’t this wait?
60	00:03:43	00:03:45	I’m sorry, no.
61	00:03:45	00:03:47	He was found under suspicious circumstances.
62	00:03:47	00:03:50	Do you have any idea who may have redressed him or moved him?
63	00:03:50	00:03:53	He usually goes with women who look a lot like me...
64	00:03:53	00:03:55	only younger.
65	00:03:56	00:04:00	And I’m embarrassed to say that I’ve been flattered by that, at times.
66	00:04:00	00:04:03	Do you have a name?
67	00:04:03	00:04:06	I was very much on the outside of that part of his life.
68	00:04:08	00:04:10	I see.
69	00:04:19	00:04:21	I know. The room’s talking to us.
70	00:04:21	00:04:24	They had champagne.
71	00:04:24	00:04:27	They were celebrating something.
72	00:04:32	00:04:34	No lipstick on either glass.
73	00:04:34	00:04:38	911 did say it was a man’s voice that placed the call.
74	00:04:40	00:04:42	Smell the musk?
75	00:04:42	00:04:44	Hint of bleach?
76	00:04:48	00:04:50	Sexual intercourse.
77	00:04:53	00:04:54	They kept the drapes open.
78	00:04:54	00:04:57	A married man who’s not worried about...
79	00:04:57	00:05:00	photographs, long lenses...
80	00:05:00	00:05:05	Well, he’s either careless or arrogant, maybe.
81	00:05:05	00:05:06	Or he has a death wish.
82	00:05:15	00:05:18	34 C?
83	00:05:18	00:05:23	If he was with a woman who was the guy on the 911 call?
84	00:05:25	00:05:27	Hand me that magnifier.
85	00:05:27	00:05:30	Thank you.
86	00:05:30	00:05:32	What do you got?
87	00:05:32	00:05:34	See those white specks?
88	00:05:37	00:05:39	What do you think, cocaine?
89	00:05:39	00:05:42	No, I don’t think so.
90	00:05:42	00:05:44	How can you tell just by looking?
91	00:05:46	00:05:48	Never you mind.
92	00:05:55	00:05:58	Let’s just get this to Trace.
93	00:06:02	00:06:04	Okay, we’re done in the elevator.
94	00:06:04	00:06:06	You guys need a hand?
95	00:06:06	00:06:09	Yeah, you want to dust the champagne bottle?
96	00:06:09	00:06:14	The average American hotel room is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.
97	00:06:14	00:06:16	Yeah, but they’re not all biological.
98	00:06:16	00:06:20	Some are soda stains, food stains, whiskey stains, you know.
99	00:06:20	00:06:26	No matter how clean or expensive the room seems that why I always travel with Nonoxinol Nine.
100	00:06:26	00:06:29	You sound like you’re making a commercial.
101	00:06:29	00:06:31	Nick, hit the lights, will you?
102	00:06:33	00:06:36	Okay, we’re looking for the freshest stains.
103	00:06:38	00:06:40	Soda, maybe...
104	00:06:40	00:06:41	Maybe champagne...
105	00:06:41	00:06:43	Oh! Someone’s little soldiers...
106	00:06:43	00:06:47	not fresh, dry.
107	00:06:47	00:06:50	More champagne.
108	00:06:57	00:06:59	Hmm...
109	00:06:59	00:07:02	Starlight, star bright, First star I see tonight.
110	00:07:04	00:07:08	Okay, I’ll let you guys do the collection.
111	00:07:09	00:07:10	Thanks a lot.
112	00:07:10	00:07:12	Oh, and Sara?
113	00:07:12	00:07:13	Hmm.
114	00:07:13	00:07:21	Last hotel room nearest the stairwell-- easy entry and egress for an intruder and if the victim fights back, 50% less chance of being heard.
115	00:07:23	00:07:26	Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.
116	00:07:33	00:07:35	You are so busted.
117	00:07:49	00:07:50	I gave this to Trace.
118	00:07:50	00:07:52	Why do you have it?
119	00:07:52	00:07:54	Well, because I deal in DNA.
120	00:07:54	00:07:57	The smallest sliver of epidermal tissue.
121	00:07:57	00:07:58	This is skin.
122	00:07:58	00:08:01	Scalp skin.
123	00:08:01	00:08:02	Itchy.
124	00:08:02	00:08:07	Can be embarrassing in social situations especially if one is wearing a dark shirt.
125	00:08:07	00:08:08	Dandruff.
126	00:08:10	00:08:13	Good chance whoever moved the guy into the elevator...
127	00:08:13	00:08:15	Had a bad case of seborrhea.
128	00:08:17	00:08:19	Thanks.
129	00:08:19	00:08:21	Hey, Catherine.
130	00:08:21	00:08:24	Do you think Sara would ever go out with me?
131	00:08:24	00:08:26	Sure.
132	00:08:26	00:08:29	As long as you don’t tell her it’s a date.
133	00:08:29	00:08:30	Hey, Cath...
134	00:08:30	00:08:33	are you on this Fairmont case?
135	00:08:33	00:08:35	House mogul caught with his pants on?
136	00:08:35	00:08:38	Yeah, I’m just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?
137	00:08:38	00:08:41	You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?
138	00:08:41	00:08:43	You serious? For what?
139	00:08:43	00:08:44	Shots fired.
140	00:08:44	00:08:47	He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.
141	00:08:47	00:08:48	Wow!
142	00:08:48	00:08:52	Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I’m wondering if that’s what really happened.
143	00:08:52	00:08:54	I’m going to pull his file and check it out.
144	00:08:54	00:08:56	Let me know.
145	00:08:56	00:08:57	I will.
146	00:08:57	00:08:59	Nice shot.
147	00:08:59	00:09:02	Reservoir’s still wet.
148	00:09:02	00:09:03	Why did he throw it?
149	00:09:03	00:09:06	Mmm. I’m only impressed if he aimed.
150	00:09:06	00:09:09	I wonder if the woman has any idea she left her DNA behind?
151	00:09:09	00:09:12	Not rocket science. Man’s inside, woman’s out.
152	00:09:14	00:09:15	Wife says the guy’s a player.
153	00:09:15	00:09:16	She doesn’t know the women.
154	00:09:16	00:09:18	You tell her about the 911 tape?
155	00:09:18	00:09:20	The male voice?
156	00:09:20	00:09:21	Oh, I just got back from Central Dispatch.
157	00:09:21	00:09:23	The tape’s lost. New computer system.
158	00:09:23	00:09:25	Any ear-witnesses?
159	00:09:25	00:09:27	The dispatcher says it could’ve been a woman whispering.
160	00:09:27	00:09:32	Or a very old person, gender indeterminate.
161	00:09:32	00:09:34	That’s about as good as an eyewitness.
162	00:09:38	00:09:39	Grissom.
163	00:09:39	00:09:41	What?
164	00:09:41	00:09:43	I’ll be right there.
165	00:09:44	00:09:47	No lunch.
166	00:09:47	00:09:48	We got a time?
167	00:09:48	00:09:52	Well, all indications are he was brain-dead from the time he collapsed at the hotel.
168	00:09:52	00:09:53	From?
169	00:09:53	00:09:57	An artery out-pouches blood floods the subarachnoid space.
170	00:09:57	00:10:00	Heart still beats, but the brain’s dead.
171	00:10:00	00:10:02	And it doesn’t regenerate.
172	00:10:02	00:10:05	Aneurysm from trauma... infection...?
173	00:10:05	00:10:07	Genetic predisposition. Both parents went that way.
174	00:10:07	00:10:11	It increases a person’s chance of stroke ten-fold.
175	00:10:11	00:10:13	He looks like an athlete.
176	00:10:13	00:10:15	Brain dead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong.
177	00:10:17	00:10:18	Is this a Frankenstein?
178	00:10:18	00:10:21	I was wondering when you’d ask.
179	00:10:21	00:10:24	Prime donor candidate.
180	00:10:24	00:10:25	Next of kin signed off.
181	00:10:25	00:10:26	How many organs they take?
182	00:10:26	00:10:28	Eight in under two hours.
183	00:10:28	00:10:30	Man, those harvest doctors move, don’t they?
184	00:10:30	00:10:32	Stat! Go, go, go!
185	00:10:32	00:10:34	Here comes the liver. Ready with a basin, please.
186	00:10:34	00:10:35	Right now.
187	00:10:35	00:10:37	And here we go.
188	00:10:38	00:10:40	Clamp it. Get it back, get it back.
189	00:10:40	00:10:42	Ready and got it. Here we go.
190	00:10:42	00:10:45	All right, I’ll notify the PD about the organs.
191	00:10:50	00:10:53	So I was thinking...
192	00:10:53	00:10:58	maybe we could take our break at the same time.
193	00:10:58	00:11:00	Later this shift.
194	00:11:00	00:11:02	Together.
195	00:11:02	00:11:03	Sure.
196	00:11:03	00:11:05	Really.
197	00:11:10	00:11:12	Semen. No surprise there.
198	00:11:12	00:11:18	Well, without the DNA sample from the hotel guy this test is pretty useless.
199	00:11:18	00:11:21	I’m more interested...
200	00:11:21	00:11:23	in who the woman is.
201	00:11:23	00:11:29	Well, just like the bra, I’m going to need a reference of her DNA in order to do anything, and that’s not going to happen until-- What the heck?
202	00:11:29	00:11:31	What?
203	00:11:31	00:11:32	Stripes.
204	00:11:35	00:11:37	Stripes.
205	00:11:37	00:11:41	Transverse white bands that appear six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.
206	00:11:41	00:11:43	You got a closer view?
207	00:11:43	00:11:45	Uh...
208	00:11:50	00:11:53	They look like Mees lines to me.
209	00:11:53	00:11:54	Could be livor mortis.
210	00:11:54	00:11:57	Or white striae, indicative of heavy metal poisoning.
211	00:11:57	00:12:00	We can’t count on a photo to draw that kind of conclusion.
212	00:12:00	00:12:01	We need the body.
213	00:12:03	00:12:05	Don’t take this wrong, Dr. Robbins, but...
214	00:12:05	00:12:09	how do you release a body that’s been redressed and dumped in an elevator?
215	00:12:09	00:12:18	I deal with cause of death, which was an aneurysm and therefore, a Natural, and based on that his body is released to a mortuary.
216	00:12:18	00:12:21	The whole transplant thing didn’t raise a flag?
217	00:12:21	00:12:26	I thought I’d raised a flag with the good doctor when I told him I was going to notify the police department.
218	00:12:26	00:12:29	But evidently, I miscommunicated again.
219	00:12:29	00:12:31	Great.
220	00:12:35	00:12:37	All may not be lost. Here...
221	00:12:37	00:12:44	Body of Robert Fairmont released at 0400 hours to the Desert Haven Mortuary.
222	00:12:44	00:12:45	I know that place.
223	00:12:45	00:12:49	Well, if they haven’t embalmed him we can still get a blood sample, test for heavy metal poisoning.
224	00:12:49	00:12:51	Good. I’ll drive.
225	00:12:53	00:12:55	You’re not coming?
226	00:12:55	00:12:57	You found it, you run with it.
227	00:12:58	00:13:01	You can do it. Take Nick.
228	00:13:01	00:13:03	Okay.
229	00:13:07	00:13:09	How long’s he been in here?
230	00:13:09	00:13:12	92 minutes at 1,600 degrees.
231	00:13:12	00:13:14	What exactly was it that you wanted to see?
232	00:13:14	00:13:15	His fingernails.
233	00:13:15	00:13:16	I’m very sorry.
234	00:13:16	00:13:18	Who approved this cremation?
235	00:13:20	00:13:22	His wife, Julia Fairmont.
236	00:13:22	00:13:25	Same person who approved the organ transplants.
237	00:13:47	00:13:50	You told me your husband was in surgery.
238	00:13:50	00:13:52	He was.
239	00:13:52	00:13:56	Surgery to take his organs not to save his life.
240	00:13:56	00:13:59	He was technically... dead.
241	00:13:59	00:14:01	He wanted to donate his organs.
242	00:14:01	00:14:04	I was following his wishes.
243	00:14:04	00:14:07	Why are you being so hostile?
244	00:14:07	00:14:10	Someone was poisoning your husband.
245	00:14:10	00:14:11	What?
246	00:14:12	00:14:18	We don’t know the dose or the duration but we do know the type of poison.
247	00:14:18	00:14:21	We processed your husband’s remains.
248	00:14:21	00:14:26	Most poisons would be completely burned off by cremation but heavy metals are very resistant to heat.
249	00:14:29	00:14:32	This heavy metal is called selenium.
250	00:14:32	00:14:36	Did you notice that your husband’s breath might have been garlicky?
251	00:14:36	00:14:38	Garlicky?
252	00:14:38	00:14:42	The body will excrete demethyl selenide-- smells just like garlic.
253	00:14:42	00:14:46	Uh... no.
254	00:14:46	00:14:49	The white stripes on his fingernails-- did you notice those?
255	00:14:49	00:14:51	Um...
256	00:14:51	00:14:54	We didn’t see each other a lot.
257	00:14:54	00:14:56	Bob was busy building his company.
258	00:14:56	00:14:59	That bother you, him never being home?
259	00:15:02	00:15:05	I think it would bother any woman.
260	00:15:07	00:15:11	Did you know that the most common choice of premeditated murder among women is poison?
261	00:15:11	00:15:13	They cite its passivity.
262	00:15:15	00:15:18	I did not poison my husband.
263	00:15:18	00:15:20	You cremated his body.
264	00:15:20	00:15:23	He wanted to be cremated. I cremated him.
265	00:15:23	00:15:25	He wanted to donate his organs. I did that, too.
266	00:15:25	00:15:29	Now, if there’s nothing else, I will be at home preparing for my husband’s memorial service.
267	00:15:29	00:15:31	Excuse me.
268	00:15:31	00:15:35	Do you want us to notify you?
269	00:15:35	00:15:37	Of what?
270	00:15:37	00:15:43	When we find out the exact amount of selenium given to your husband and over what period of time?
271	00:15:43	00:15:46	I thought you couldn’t tell.
272	00:15:46	00:15:49	Your husband’s gone, but his organs are still out there.
273	00:15:49	00:15:51	Well, good.
274	00:15:51	00:15:55	Yes, I would like to be notified.
275	00:16:01	00:16:03	Straight up, am I going to die?
276	00:16:03	00:16:07	You have only a small fraction of the poison that was in your donor’s body-- one organ.
277	00:16:07	00:16:10	With nothing new coming in it should work its way out.
278	00:16:10	00:16:13	I must’ve had 100 tests.
279	00:16:13	00:16:15	How’d you doctors miss this?
280	00:16:15	00:16:19	A heavy metal like selenium presents so rarely that it’s not part of our screening protocol.
281	00:16:21	00:16:24	You don’t look like a doctor.
282	00:16:24	00:16:25	No, sir, no, I’m not.
283	00:16:25	00:16:27	I’m Nick Stokes.
284	00:16:27	00:16:28	I’m with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
285	00:16:28	00:16:30	I’ll be right outside.
286	00:16:30	00:16:32	Thank you, Doctor.
287	00:16:34	00:16:38	I was hoping I might be able to get a sample of that new kidney of yours.
288	00:16:38	00:16:40	A sample?
289	00:16:40	00:16:41	Biopsy. A sliver.
290	00:16:41	00:16:43	You mean open me up again?
291	00:16:43	00:16:47	Maybe an invasive scope.
292	00:16:47	00:16:52	The only way I can get an accurate barometer of the poison in Mr. Fairmont’s system is through one of his organs.
293	00:16:52	00:16:57	I’m sorry, young man, but this is my kidney now.
294	00:16:57	00:16:59	I waited four years.
295	00:16:59	00:17:02	I can’t have anyone cut into me for it.
296	00:17:02	00:17:03	I just can’t.
297	00:17:03	00:17:07	No, hey, I understand.
298	00:17:07	00:17:09	Thank you for your time.
299	00:17:11	00:17:13	I like your watch, man, that’s cool.
300	00:17:13	00:17:18	It broke while I was down in surgery-- 00.
301	00:17:18	00:17:20	Think the Lord’s trying to tell me something?
302	00:17:22	00:17:24	Yeah, get it to a watch repair shop.
303	00:17:27	00:17:31	I hope you get to feeling better, Mr. Mercer.
304	00:17:42	00:17:43	Nick struck out on the kidney.
305	00:17:43	00:17:45	I got four no’s over the phone.
306	00:17:45	00:17:48	One yes from a recipient in Illinois--heart.
307	00:17:48	00:17:51	Useless--heart has no memory for poison.
308	00:17:51	00:17:55	Why can’t we cut the middle man and just check the wife’s house for selenium?
309	00:17:55	00:17:58	All right, I know, something about Constitutional law.
310	00:17:58	00:18:00	Get probable cause, then get a search warrant...
311	00:18:00	00:18:03	Sara! I was just looking for you.
312	00:18:03	00:18:05	Still up for break?
313	00:18:05	00:18:07	Sorry, Greggo. Hot case.
314	00:18:07	00:18:09	I’m going to go look at Nick’s champagne bottle.
315	00:18:09	00:18:11	How you doing with our DNA?
316	00:18:11	00:18:17	Uh... inside-outside we’re still looking for a reference for comparison but the epidermals are looking promising.
317	00:18:17	00:18:19	Nice.
318	00:18:19	00:18:21	You want to clue me in?
319	00:18:21	00:18:24	Sara and I were just going out for dinner.
320	00:18:24	00:18:26	On the case, Greggo.
321	00:18:26	00:18:29	Oh. Right.
322	00:18:34	00:18:35	Excuse me...
323	00:18:35	00:18:38	I’m Claudia Gideon, Bob Fairmont’s secretary.
324	00:18:38	00:18:39	I came to pick up his property.
325	00:18:39	00:18:42	Oh, I’m sorry, but Ms. Willows already asked for them.
326	00:18:42	00:18:45	His property is part of our investigation.
327	00:18:45	00:18:47	I’m afraid I have to take it.
328	00:18:47	00:18:48	Oh, fine. I was just doing my job.
329	00:18:48	00:18:50	Yeah, me, too.
330	00:18:50	00:18:54	Did you work for the Fairmonts three years ago, when Mr. Fairmont was shot?
331	00:18:54	00:18:56	I was out sick that day.
332	00:18:56	00:18:58	Interesting.
333	00:18:59	00:19:02	You have dandruff.
334	00:19:02	00:19:06	Is that really proper etiquette?
335	00:19:06	00:19:08	It is when I’m on a case.
336	00:19:08	00:19:10	You mind?
337	00:19:14	00:19:16	Where did you say you worked?
338	00:19:18	00:19:23	I’m going to ask you again-- were you in that hotel room with Bob Fairmont?
339	00:19:23	00:19:25	I was not, no.
340	00:19:25	00:19:28	But you did redress him and place him in the elevator.
341	00:19:28	00:19:30	You don’t know what you’re talking about.
342	00:19:30	00:19:33	Well, that’s dangerous to say to a scientist.
343	00:19:34	00:19:38	Dandruff is nothing more than sloughed-off skin.
344	00:19:38	00:19:43	It has a nucleus just like a cell on your arm or your big toe.
345	00:19:43	00:19:52	These 13 DNA markers from this dandruff cell are a match to the dandruff that I recovered from your sweater.
346	00:19:52	00:19:54	You were there.
347	00:19:54	00:19:56	At the hotel.
348	00:20:01	00:20:03	Okay.
349	00:20:03	00:20:10	Mr. Fairmont told me earlier that day 00 to pick up some papers, okay?
350	00:20:10	00:20:14	When I got there, he was in bed-- naked, unconscious.
351	00:20:14	00:20:19	He always told me reputation before health-- no scandals.
352	00:20:19	00:20:21	I dragged him to the elevator.
353	00:20:28	00:20:32	Let me guess-- you snuck out down the stairwell.
354	00:20:33	00:20:35	Who was Fairmont partying with in that room?
355	00:20:35	00:20:37	I don’t know.
356	00:20:37	00:20:44	Well, we won’t mind if we compare your DNA to the vaginal contribution of a condom that we recovered from Mr. Fairmont’s room?
357	00:20:44	00:20:46	Sure, go ahead. Good.
358	00:20:46	00:20:54	We’d like to show you something else-- about that accidental shooting three years ago at your boss’ house.
359	00:20:54	00:20:59	In this reenactment Fairmont shot himself while cleaning his gun.
360	00:21:01	00:21:02	The story just doesn’t add up.
361	00:21:02	00:21:10	I think I fell for it because I was new and I wasn’t too eager to talk to another guy about him almost shooting off his manhood.
362	00:21:12	00:21:17	This is the room as it was then based off of my crime scene photos.
363	00:21:17	00:21:21	This is crime scene reconstruction, new school.
364	00:21:21	00:21:23	Works backward, reverse time.
365	00:21:23	00:21:25	The bullet hit here.
366	00:21:27	00:21:35	The only logical place for that bullet to have been shot from is four meters away, one meter high.
367	00:21:35	00:21:39	He didn’t accidentally shoot himself.
368	00:21:39	00:21:40	Someone shot him.
369	00:21:40	00:21:41	We’re thinking it was you.
370	00:21:43	00:21:46	The admission form from the ER, 9/6/98.
371	00:21:46	00:21:50	The person who brought Fairmont in on the accidental shooting...
372	00:21:50	00:21:53	was you.
373	00:21:53	00:21:56	I didn’t shoot him.
374	00:21:56	00:21:57	You didn’t poison him, either.
375	00:21:57	00:21:59	All these bad things just happen to you.
376	00:21:59	00:22:02	I’m on call 24 hours a day, okay?
377	00:22:02	00:22:04	Mr. Fairmont beeped me.
378	00:22:04	00:22:06	I drove out to the house, and I took him in.
379	00:22:06	00:22:08	Where was his wife?
380	00:22:11	00:22:14	You’d have to ask her.
381	00:22:14	00:22:15	Yes, I shot him.
382	00:22:15	00:22:20	He was supposed to go riding with me 00 in the morning.
383	00:22:20	00:22:22	No calls, nothing.
384	00:22:22	00:22:25	I was... hurt.
385	00:22:25	00:22:31	So, you just sat there in the dark and aimed south of his belt.
386	00:22:31	00:22:33	I just wanted to scare him.
387	00:22:33	00:22:35	It was a business meeting.
388	00:22:35	00:22:36	I swear.
389	00:22:36	00:22:38	I-It wasn’t like before.
390	00:22:38	00:22:41	I was thinking about you the whole time.
391	00:22:41	00:22:43	So, why didn’t you tell the truth then?
392	00:22:43	00:22:46	I wanted to, but Bob wouldn’t let me.
393	00:22:46	00:22:49	He said that it would ruin his career-- Fairmont Family Estates.
394	00:22:49	00:22:54	I’m presenting this case to the D.A., even if it is three years old.
395	00:22:54	00:22:55	My husband’s dead.
396	00:22:55	00:22:59	We had our problems but I loved him.
397	00:22:59	00:23:02	I don’t... I don’t much care what you do now.
398	00:23:02	00:23:04	Well, there’s only two reasons a woman shoots a man.
399	00:23:04	00:23:06	She either loves him or hates him.
400	00:23:06	00:23:07	Or both.
401	00:23:11	00:23:17	And that’s the sample Catherine pulled off of the secretary’s blouse and the hotel man’s clothes-- same source.
402	00:23:17	00:23:18	Secretary moved the body.
403	00:23:18	00:23:20	We just interviewed her.
404	00:23:20	00:23:21	She copped to moving him.
405	00:23:21	00:23:23	We’re looking hard at the wife on the poisoning.
406	00:23:23	00:23:26	The secretary has dandruff.
407	00:23:26	00:23:27	We know.
408	00:23:27	00:23:30	Dermatomycoses seborrhea-- we got it.
409	00:23:30	00:23:33	Topical eczemas like that require prescription medication.
410	00:23:33	00:23:38	The primary ingredient of those medications-- selenium sulfide.
411	00:23:38	00:23:41	I don’t really feel right about doing this.
412	00:23:41	00:23:43	Oh, this is your residence.
413	00:23:43	00:23:45	Everything in Claudia’s office is your property.
414	00:23:45	00:23:47	She could be back from dinner at any moment.
415	00:23:47	00:23:49	This shouldn’t take long.
416	00:24:27	00:24:29	That’s mine.
417	00:24:29	00:24:34	Could you tell us why you keep your shampoo in your office?
418	00:24:34	00:24:38	Shampoo full of the same poison found in Bob Fairmont’s remains?
419	00:24:38	00:24:39	I don’t know.
420	00:24:39	00:24:41	Aw, you have to do better than that.
421	00:24:41	00:24:45	Maybe I picked it up at the pharmacy on lunch and put it there.
422	00:24:45	00:24:46	I don’t know.
423	00:24:56	00:24:59	Cream cheese.
424	00:25:01	00:25:02	Garlic cream cheese.
425	00:25:02	00:25:04	Hides the bitter aftertaste.
426	00:25:11	00:25:15	It explains away his bad breath.
427	00:25:17	00:25:18	I did not poison him.
428	00:25:20	00:25:21	We’ll see.
429	00:25:23	00:25:25	Aren’t you going to arrest her?
430	00:25:26	00:25:27	I haven’t done anything.
431	00:25:27	00:25:29	Other than poison Bob.
432	00:25:29	00:25:30	Poison?
433	00:25:30	00:25:32	I’m the one who looked out for him.
434	00:25:32	00:25:33	You? I ran his home.
435	00:25:33	00:25:35	I entertained his clients.
436	00:25:35	00:25:37	Who made all of his dental appointments, huh?
437	00:25:37	00:25:40	His haircuts? Who got his taxes in on time?
438	00:25:40	00:25:41	Covered for his mistresses.
439	00:25:41	00:25:45	Oh... why did he need mistresses?
440	00:25:45	00:25:46	Ladies...
441	00:25:46	00:25:47	don’t go there.
442	00:25:50	00:25:51	This is yours...
443	00:25:51	00:25:52	and these are yours.
444	00:25:52	00:25:54	There’s the door.
445	00:25:54	00:25:57	We build a case before we make any arrests.
446	00:26:01	00:26:02	Hey, Mr. Mercer.
447	00:26:02	00:26:04	I got your message.
448	00:26:04	00:26:06	You wanted to talk to me?
449	00:26:06	00:26:09	Did you find out who poisoned Mr. Fairmont?
450	00:26:09	00:26:10	No.
451	00:26:10	00:26:16	No, sir. I have found selenium in his office but... without actually knowing how much was in his system...
452	00:26:16	00:26:19	What if I could tell you?
453	00:26:19	00:26:21	My body’s rejecting the organ.
454	00:26:21	00:26:23	Doctor says it’s got nothing to do with poison.
455	00:26:23	00:26:24	It’s antibodies.
456	00:26:27	00:26:28	I’m sorry.
457	00:26:28	00:26:33	I told you this watch stopped while I was down in surgery?
458	00:26:33	00:26:35	It’s funny...
459	00:26:35	00:26:39	it’s like it knew all along the kidney wasn’t going to take.
460	00:26:39	00:26:46	Anyway... there’s one last good thing I can do before I leave this earth.
461	00:26:46	00:26:49	So... how do we do this?
462	00:26:54	00:26:59	I can’t even talk Warrick into splitting a sandwich with me and this guy’s willing to give us his kidney?
463	00:26:59	00:27:00	You asked for it.
464	00:27:00	00:27:01	Yeah, that’s my point.
465	00:27:01	00:27:07	Carl Mercer risks dying sooner to help our investigation but who protects his rights?
466	00:27:07	00:27:10	He has free will.
467	00:27:10	00:27:11	Well, so do I.
468	00:27:11	00:27:13	I want to retract our request.
469	00:27:13	00:27:16	I don’t think any investigation for the dead is worth hurting the living.
470	00:27:20	00:27:22	What?
471	00:27:22	00:27:23	Guys?
472	00:27:23	00:27:25	You’re not going to believe this.
473	00:27:25	00:27:26	Funny.
474	00:27:26	00:27:29	Sometimes it is the simplest things that seem so difficult.
475	00:27:29	00:27:32	I’ve been trying to match the partial from the champagne bottle to these known prints.
476	00:27:32	00:27:34	It was upside down.
477	00:27:41	00:27:47	Must’ve grabbed the bottle... upside-down to pour.
478	00:27:58	00:28:00	So...
479	00:28:00	00:28:01	who was he with?
480	00:28:01	00:28:03	Mrs. Fairmont.
481	00:28:03	00:28:07	What? Player was in the hotel cheating with his own wife?
482	00:28:07	00:28:11	I was trying to... rekindle our marriage.
483	00:28:11	00:28:15	I... got the room... brought the champagne.
484	00:28:15	00:28:17	Oh, yes.
485	00:28:17	00:28:18	Yes.
486	00:28:18	00:28:21	He squeezed me in between business meetings at the hotel.
487	00:28:21	00:28:25	And you didn’t think to tell me that when we first talked?
488	00:28:25	00:28:29	No, because you asked me about him being redressed in an elevator...
489	00:28:29	00:28:35	and, besides, when I left him, he was... alive watching the news.
490	00:28:42	00:28:45	Oh, so, he had a stroke alone, after you left.
491	00:28:49	00:28:50	I’m not a doctor.
492	00:28:50	00:28:52	I don’t know when he had it.
493	00:28:52	00:28:55	Well, CSI is testing that champagne bottle for selenium.
494	00:28:55	00:28:58	I didn’t think poison caused strokes.
495	00:28:58	00:29:02	You seem to know a lot about poison for not being a doctor.
496	00:29:04	00:29:09	I know a lot of things about a lot of things but that doesn’t mean that I killed my husband.
497	00:29:12	00:29:16	Yeah... but what never lies?
498	00:29:18	00:29:20	Fairmont had three gold crowns.
499	00:29:20	00:29:23	They should’ve survived the cremation.
500	00:29:23	00:29:27	At least partially. Heavy metal, after all.
501	00:29:27	00:29:30	His wife...
502	00:29:30	00:29:32	had them removed at the mortuary.
503	00:29:32	00:29:35	That adds new meaning to the phrase gold digger.
504	00:29:35	00:29:37	Actually, that’s how the phrase got started.
505	00:29:37	00:29:40	People used to dig up the bodies to extract the gold.
506	00:29:40	00:29:41	Now they just marry them.
507	00:29:41	00:29:46	In some countries, this would be enough to have her arrested for murdering her husband.
508	00:29:46	00:29:50	What’s the most important component in a poisoning?
509	00:29:50	00:29:53	Poison.
510	00:29:53	00:29:54	Patience.
511	00:30:03	00:30:05	Ms. Fairmont...
512	00:30:05	00:30:06	Ms. Fairmont, you feeling okay?
513	00:30:06	00:30:07	Yeah, I’m, I’m...
514	00:30:09	00:30:10	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
515	00:30:10	00:30:12	Hey... Maybe I just need to sit down... for a minute.
516	00:30:12	00:30:15	Yeah, yeah, let’s sit down here in the car for a sec.
517	00:30:17	00:30:20	There you go. Relax, relax, relax.
518	00:30:23	00:30:24	Yeah, I need an ambulance.
519	00:30:24	00:30:26	Uh, Vegas PD, west parking lot.
520	00:30:52	00:30:54	Hey, what’s going on?
521	00:30:54	00:30:55	We called the hospital.
522	00:30:55	00:30:57	She’s been released.
523	00:30:57	00:30:59	ER doc gave her a shot of Hydropazeen...
524	00:30:59	00:31:00	sent her on her way.
525	00:31:00	00:31:01	Hydropazeen?
526	00:31:01	00:31:06	That’s an antiemetic used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.
527	00:31:06	00:31:10	Which means... somebody’s been poisoning our suspect.
528	00:31:10	00:31:13	I don’t know how it happened.
529	00:31:13	00:31:15	Maybe she poisoned herself.
530	00:31:15	00:31:17	Why would she do that?
531	00:31:17	00:31:20	Why would she hide my shampoo in my office?
532	00:31:20	00:31:21	What, you know she did that?
533	00:31:21	00:31:22	Well, it wasn’t her husband.
534	00:31:22	00:31:24	He was already dead.
535	00:31:24	00:31:26	She’s trying to frame me for killing him.
536	00:31:26	00:31:29	I mean, do you have anything beyond your suspicions that she did kill him?
537	00:31:29	00:31:31	She had his gold fillings removed.
538	00:31:31	00:31:34	Doesn’t that tell you something about her?
539	00:31:35	00:31:38	I had his watch and ring removed, too.
540	00:31:38	00:31:40	Do you want to see them?
541	00:31:40	00:31:41	They’re in a box at home.
542	00:31:41	00:31:44	You realize that doesn’t look good?
543	00:31:44	00:31:45	It can look however it wants.
544	00:31:45	00:31:47	I have nothing to hide.
545	00:31:47	00:31:49	You mean since you yourself have been poisoned?
546	00:31:49	00:31:51	Yeah, why aren’t you asking Claudia Richards about that?
547	00:31:51	00:31:53	First my husband, then me?
548	00:31:53	00:31:55	Why would she want to kill either one of you?
549	00:31:55	00:31:57	I don’t know.
550	00:31:59	00:32:02	Maybe because he refused...
551	00:32:02	00:32:05	to leave me for her.
552	00:32:05	00:32:08	I had to wash his grungy coffee mug every night.
553	00:32:08	00:32:11	I had to clean his toenail clippings off of his desktop.
554	00:32:11	00:32:14	Why would I ever ask Bob Fairmont to leave anyone for me?
555	00:32:14	00:32:17	So, you think it was all in Mrs. Fairmont’s head?
556	00:32:17	00:32:20	He always said she was crazy.
557	00:32:20	00:32:22	Okay, that’s it. All right...
558	00:32:22	00:32:25	Look, we’re not leaving here till we get to the bottom of this.
559	00:32:25	00:32:28	Then I hope she talks soon.
560	00:32:39	00:32:40	Greg?
561	00:32:40	00:32:42	Hey.
562	00:32:42	00:32:46	I was just printing something out for you on your hot case.
563	00:32:46	00:32:48	From the Internet?
564	00:32:48	00:32:50	Yeah, I...
565	00:32:50	00:32:52	I was... on break, had some time...
566	00:32:52	00:32:54	thought, hey...
567	00:32:56	00:32:59	Sorry, I drew a blank on the wife.
568	00:32:59	00:33:04	I could really, really just kiss you right now.
569	00:33:13	00:33:15	So, this is Claudia.
570	00:33:15	00:33:20	Ten years ago, her husband, John Gideon.
571	00:33:24	00:33:27	Claudia’s rich husband also died young-- 35.
572	00:33:27	00:33:32	She donated his organs and cremated his body.
573	00:33:32	00:33:33	We don’t have to chase down these organs.
574	00:33:33	00:33:38	Ralph Parks rejected the organ that he got from Claudia’s husband.
575	00:33:38	00:33:39	An organ with a memory, maybe?
576	00:33:39	00:33:41	The most. Liver.
577	00:33:41	00:33:45	He died two months after receiving it back in ’93.
578	00:33:45	00:33:48	Lived one state over in Arizona.
579	00:33:48	00:33:50	I have the cemetery address.
580	00:33:50	00:33:52	Hey, Sara, got the warrant.
581	00:33:52	00:33:53	Awesome.
582	00:33:53	00:33:55	We’ll keep you posted.
583	00:34:17	00:34:21	Embalming certainly retards the decomposition process.
584	00:34:21	00:34:23	Yeah, well, it doesn’t stop the smell.
585	00:34:23	00:34:27	The liver’s degraded but any metal should still be there.
586	00:34:29	00:34:31	We’ll find out.
587	00:35:15	00:35:17	Nick, did you get anything?
588	00:35:17	00:35:18	Hey, Sara. Yeah.
589	00:35:18	00:35:21	Sodium selenite--selenium.
590	00:35:21	00:35:25	280 milligrams for a 180-pound man...
591	00:35:25	00:35:26	That’s murder.
592	00:35:26	00:35:29	Yeah, well, it would have been murder for a 300-pound man.
593	00:35:29	00:35:31	This is different than the shampoo compound.
594	00:35:31	00:35:35	Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E.
595	00:35:35	00:35:38	That combination’s found in selenium supplements injected in animals.
596	00:35:38	00:35:41	Animals? Like cats, dogs?
597	00:35:41	00:35:44	Mostly livestock, grazers.
598	00:35:44	00:35:47	To make up for the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil.
599	00:35:47	00:35:50	How did Claudia get access to this stuff?
600	00:35:50	00:35:53	A dairy farm.
601	00:35:53	00:35:56	Gideon Dairy and Cheese.
602	00:35:56	00:35:59	Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact.
603	00:36:01	00:36:05	Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce type about Claudia’s husband.
604	00:36:05	00:36:08	You want to know who his secretary was?
605	00:36:08	00:36:10	Yeah.
606	00:36:10	00:36:11	Yeah.
607	00:36:13	00:36:14	Our Julia Fairmont.
608	00:36:20	00:36:27	Ten years ago, you played secretary and you played wife to John Gideon.
609	00:36:27	00:36:32	We have never represented we didn’t know each other previously.
610	00:36:32	00:36:34	And I wasn’t playing.
611	00:36:34	00:36:37	I was a hard-working secretary.
612	00:36:37	00:36:41	And you loved your husband right up to the day he died...
613	00:36:41	00:36:44	of 240 milligrams of selenium.
614	00:36:44	00:36:47	Animal selenium, the kind used for cattle.
615	00:36:47	00:36:49	Well, we did live in grazing country.
616	00:36:49	00:36:53	Although, I have to say, Julia knew more about livestock than I did.
617	00:36:53	00:36:54	She rode horses.
618	00:36:54	00:36:59	I took the job because Mr. G let me board my horse at the family stables.
619	00:36:59	00:37:01	Oh, I hated the stables.
620	00:37:01	00:37:03	The smell. Never stepped foot in them.
621	00:37:03	00:37:07	Implicating you, the secretary.
622	00:37:08	00:37:10	I don’t believe this.
623	00:37:10	00:37:12	Bravo. ladies.
624	00:37:12	00:37:15	You have got this down to a science.
625	00:37:16	00:37:20	Why did it happen the first time?
626	00:37:20	00:37:29	Hubby ignored you or abused you or you got sick of him fooling around so you started slipping the cow stuff into his chocolate milk?
627	00:37:36	00:37:38	So the two of you struck a deal.
628	00:37:38	00:37:39	I’m, uh...
629	00:37:39	00:37:41	I’m coming into a lot of money.
630	00:37:51	00:37:53	No, we are.
631	00:37:56	00:37:58	And then what?
632	00:37:58	00:38:02	The two of you realized how quickly you could run through a couple million?
633	00:38:02	00:38:05	So you went looking for another mark here in Nevada?
634	00:38:05	00:38:10	But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont.
635	00:38:12	00:38:22	You shot him because he was cheating but that didn’t get in the way of your long-term goals, did it?
636	00:38:34	00:38:35	I just came from the D.A.
637	00:38:35	00:38:38	Their attorneys were there as well.
638	00:38:38	00:38:42	Based on everything we have the D.A. is not going to move forward.
639	00:38:42	00:38:43	He says it’s a reject.
640	00:38:43	00:38:45	Brass doesn’t have anything?
641	00:38:45	00:38:47	Brass is still in the field.
642	00:38:47	00:38:50	You’re free to go.
643	00:38:57	00:38:59	Where’s the ladies’ room?
644	00:38:59	00:39:03	It’s down the hall to your right.
645	00:39:03	00:39:04	Thanks.
646	00:39:06	00:39:08	Pardon me.
647	00:39:08	00:39:11	Well, no big surprise.
648	00:39:11	00:39:15	We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.
649	00:39:15	00:39:18	I like either one of them for the murder-- so will a jury.
650	00:39:18	00:39:21	She-said/she-said defense? It’s never going to fly.
651	00:39:21	00:39:24	They’ll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.
652	00:39:24	00:39:26	That’s what the D.A. said verbatim.
653	00:39:26	00:39:28	See you back at CSI.
654	00:39:28	00:39:29	Wait. What?
655	00:39:29	00:39:33	So, what, and just let them move on to another state, another husband?
656	00:39:33	00:39:35	It’s not always up to us.
657	00:39:49	00:39:52	Sara...
658	00:39:52	00:39:53	look...
659	00:39:53	00:39:59	I know this isn’t news to you but sometimes science isn’t enough.
660	00:39:59	00:40:02	What are we doing?
661	00:40:02	00:40:09	Digging up graves, chasing prints-- if it’s no good in court...
662	00:40:09	00:40:11	if the killers win...
663	00:40:11	00:40:13	It isn’t a competition.
664	00:40:13	00:40:14	We don’t win.
665	00:40:14	00:40:17	The courts are like dice.
666	00:40:17	00:40:18	They have no memory.
667	00:40:18	00:40:20	What works one week doesn’t work the next.
668	00:40:20	00:40:22	I know that. I do.
669	00:40:22	00:40:25	I know that.
670	00:40:25	00:40:26	That’s why I’m mad.
671	00:40:26	00:40:30	But, see, if you get mad, then they do win.
672	00:40:30	00:40:31	You just said...
673	00:40:35	00:40:38	This is one of your riddles, isn’t it?
674	00:40:38	00:40:41	One of life’s riddles...
675	00:40:43	00:40:44	but, hey...
676	00:40:44	00:40:49	the good news-- there’s no statute of limitation on murder.
