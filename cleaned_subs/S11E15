0	00:00:04	00:00:05	Hey, Nick.
1	00:00:05	00:00:06	Hey, there he is!
2	00:00:06	00:00:07	Where are you heading?
3	00:00:07	00:00:13	Well, if I don't go to the gym now, I won't go at all. You feeling obligated to leave Doc Robbins a good-looking corpse?
4	00:00:13	00:00:16	(chuckles) Yeah, something like that.
5	00:00:16	00:00:18	Hey, you got a big day in court today, don't you?
6	00:00:18	00:00:19	Yeah. Nate Haskell.
7	00:00:19	00:00:21	Putting my game face on.
8	00:00:21	00:00:26	Well... I'd tell you to give him hell, but that's probably where he's going anyway.
9	00:00:26	00:00:28	Good luck. Thanks.
10	00:00:28	00:00:30	Yeah.
11	00:01:02	00:01:09	Your Honor, I've spent the last three days in this courtroom trying to control myself, which has not been easy, I assure you.
12	00:01:09	00:01:20	The media has tried to portray me as some sort of monster, some seven-headed beast who sprang from a smoking pit to spread death across the land.
13	00:01:20	00:01:34	But here I sit, caged, before you, a man like any other man, with only one head, with two hands, and with a troubled heart.
14	00:01:34	00:01:35	Objection.
15	00:01:35	00:01:36	Is there a point here, Your Honor?
16	00:01:36	00:01:41	Mr. Haskell, I advise you to let your attorney do the talking. But I object to that, Your Honor.
17	00:01:41	00:01:49	The jury needs to see the real Nate Haskell; the vulnerable little boy who was sadistically abused by an alcoholic father.
18	00:01:49	00:01:51	For the record...
19	00:01:51	00:01:54	that traumatized child still trembles in me.
20	00:01:54	00:02:01	I know there's some in this courtroom who can relate to my torment.
21	00:02:01	00:02:03	Unfortunately, Your Honor, my attorney is not one of them.
22	00:02:03	00:02:05	You know, he doesn't even like me.
23	00:02:05	00:02:07	Your Honor! The court has appointed him.
24	00:02:07	00:02:09	But I, I would like to un-appoint him.
25	00:02:09	00:02:12	See how he shies away from me.
26	00:02:12	00:02:13	How can I trust him?
27	00:02:13	00:02:16	The only one who can speak for Nate Haskell is Nate Haskell.
28	00:02:16	00:02:17	Mr. Haskell.
29	00:02:17	00:02:19	Are you asking to represent yourself?
30	00:02:19	00:02:21	I believe the legal term is pro per, Your Honor.
31	00:02:21	00:02:25	For the record, I think you're making a mistake.
32	00:02:25	00:02:26	But...
33	00:02:26	00:02:27	(gavel bangs) so ordered.
34	00:02:27	00:02:31	Let the record show that Mr. Haskell is now proceeding pro per.
35	00:02:31	00:02:36	But, I warn you, Mr. Haskell, there will be no delays in this trial.
36	00:02:36	00:02:39	Oh, excellent, Your Honor. Excellent.
37	00:02:39	00:02:40	I say...
38	00:02:42	00:02:44	Let's get it on. Hm?
39	00:03:07	00:03:08	Stokes.
40	00:03:08	00:03:11	You said you wanted to be my friend.
41	00:03:11	00:03:12	Yeah, who's this?
42	00:03:12	00:03:14	You said you wouldn't let the cops kill my brother.
43	00:03:14	00:03:16	And then you empty your gun into him?
44	00:03:16	00:03:19	Jason McCann?
45	00:03:19	00:03:22	I should just let you die, like you did Alex.
46	00:03:28	00:03:30	How'd you get my number?
47	00:03:30	00:03:32	Wait, they're coming. I gotta go.
48	00:03:32	00:03:33	Whatever you do, don't go home.
49	00:03:43	00:03:46	Control, this is Charlie 0-5 Stokes.
50	00:03:46	00:03:48	I'm at 922 Rose Avenue.
51	00:03:48	00:03:51	You, uh, better get the bomb squad out here.
52	00:03:54	00:03:56	Code three.
53	00:04:38	00:04:41	M67 frag grenade in a can.
54	00:04:41	00:04:43	Pretty simple booby-trap.
55	00:04:43	00:04:45	Kill zone up to five meters.
56	00:04:45	00:04:48	All right, Stokes.
57	00:04:48	00:04:51	Back up, slowly.
58	00:04:51	00:04:52	Might be more surprises.
59	00:04:52	00:04:53	I hope not.
60	00:04:53	00:04:56	I'm already eight lives down...
61	00:04:56	00:04:57	if you know what I mean.
62	00:04:57	00:04:58	I hear you, brother.
63	00:05:09	00:05:11	Right this way. Get off me! I'm all right.
64	00:05:11	00:05:13	Yes, sir.
65	00:05:13	00:05:14	No sign of forced entry.
66	00:05:14	00:05:18	But we'll play it safe. We'll sweep the rest of the house for any more explosives.
67	00:05:18	00:05:19	Okay!
68	00:05:19	00:05:21	I safetied the device.
69	00:05:21	00:05:23	I'll blow it and I'll send you what's left.
70	00:05:23	00:05:25	Don't forget the trip-wire knot.
71	00:05:25	00:05:27	I'll send it in the package.
72	00:05:27	00:05:28	You can bronze it for Stokes.
73	00:05:28	00:05:31	Along with this piece of his wall.
74	00:05:31	00:05:33	Sic semper tyrannis.
75	00:05:33	00:05:35	Thus always to tyrants.
76	00:05:35	00:05:37	Slogan for every whack job.
77	00:05:37	00:05:40	They came to my house! That kid has my private number!
78	00:05:40	00:05:43	I tell you what-- if they're looking for a fight, they found one.
79	00:05:43	00:05:45	I'm not afraid to die. Let's see if they are.
80	00:05:45	00:05:46	Nick, come on now.
81	00:05:46	00:05:48	I'm serious! I know you're serious.
82	00:05:48	00:05:49	Just dial it down.
83	00:05:49	00:05:51	Come on.
84	00:05:51	00:05:53	Did you see anything?
85	00:05:53	00:05:55	I don't know.
86	00:05:55	00:05:56	There was a maroon van.
87	00:05:56	00:06:01	Wi-with, uh, uh, an extended cab on the roof-- you know?-- I-I didn't think anything of it.
88	00:06:01	00:06:02	Neighbors saw that same van; it's gone.
89	00:06:02	00:06:07	You think they were sitting in that van, waiting for me to blow up? Huh?
90	00:06:07	00:06:09	You said that Jason McCann called you?
91	00:06:09	00:06:13	Yeah, I mean, I think that kid saved my life/ Nick, that kid should be in jail.
92	00:06:13	00:06:14	He helped blow up a police funeral.
93	00:06:14	00:06:15	Yeah, the D.A.
94	00:06:15	00:06:17	couldn't make the case back then.
95	00:06:17	00:06:22	Now, all of a sudden, you've got a bomb that shows up on your doorstep, and he calls you... just in time.
96	00:06:22	00:06:25	No, it's no coincidence. Hail his ass in to PD.
97	00:06:32	00:06:33	Thank you, Dr. Langston.
98	00:06:33	00:06:36	No further questions.
99	00:06:38	00:06:41	Well, Ray, shall we...
100	00:06:41	00:06:44	go back to the moment I stabbed you?
101	00:06:44	00:06:50	Will you describe for the court and me... how it felt...
102	00:06:50	00:06:53	when I plunged my shank into your kidney?
103	00:06:53	00:06:56	Objection! Irrelevant. Defense is indulging in gratuitous sadism.
104	00:06:56	00:07:00	Question goes to state of mind, Your Honor, which is key to my defense.
105	00:07:00	00:07:01	Overruled.
106	00:07:01	00:07:03	I'll allow it, for now.
107	00:07:03	00:07:06	Well, Ray, how did it feel?
108	00:07:07	00:07:11	Painful. Can you be more specific?
109	00:07:11	00:07:13	More... poetic?
110	00:07:13	00:07:15	You're a published writer, Ray.
111	00:07:15	00:07:18	Describe the sensation when my shank first pierced your skin.
112	00:07:22	00:07:23	Sharp.
113	00:07:23	00:07:25	White-hot. And after that...
114	00:07:25	00:07:28	what did you feel?
115	00:07:33	00:07:36	Lightheaded. Very lightheaded. Oh...
116	00:07:36	00:07:42	And-and-and as you laid down then, and your life was draining away, you gazed into my eyes.
117	00:07:44	00:07:46	What did you feel then, Ray?
118	00:07:46	00:07:47	Disbelief.
119	00:07:47	00:07:49	That's a thought. Give me a feeling.
120	00:07:52	00:07:53	Fear.
121	00:07:53	00:07:55	What?
122	00:07:55	00:07:56	Fear.
123	00:07:56	00:07:59	You felt what? I was afraid I was going to die.
124	00:07:59	00:08:01	Yes.
125	00:08:01	00:08:06	A perfectly normal human reaction to a horrific experience.
126	00:08:06	00:08:11	Objection! Sustained. The defendant will confine himself to questioning the witness.
127	00:08:11	00:08:13	Boring, but fine.
128	00:08:13	00:08:15	Ray?
129	00:08:15	00:08:23	When I look at you, when I see the anguish I caused you, I feel... nothing.
130	00:08:23	00:08:24	Objection!
131	00:08:24	00:08:32	Don't you think I wantto feel something, Ray? The emotions that a normal human being feels?
132	00:08:32	00:08:36	Steady, calm, emotionless.
133	00:08:36	00:08:37	That's just not right!
134	00:08:37	00:08:39	Your Honor! This is outrageous.
135	00:08:39	00:08:41	Sustained. Strike the defendant's last statement.
136	00:08:41	00:08:44	The jury is instructed to disregard it.
137	00:08:44	00:08:46	No further questions, Your Honor.
138	00:08:53	00:08:55	Bomber used a Z-type bowline on the grenade?
139	00:08:55	00:09:00	Makes him a lefty. Most people don't tie anything more complicated than their shoes.
140	00:09:00	00:09:03	Less than 15% of the population are lefties.
141	00:09:03	00:09:05	He added a half hitch to the end.
142	00:09:05	00:09:06	You know, it's weird.
143	00:09:06	00:09:10	It's the same signature that Alex McCann used on the bombs at the police funeral, and he's dead.
144	00:09:10	00:09:12	Well, we know he wasn't acting alone.
145	00:09:12	00:09:15	What about his brother Jason. Maybe he's a lefty?
146	00:09:15	00:09:16	Let's check LIMS.
147	00:09:26	00:09:29	Mm... Doesn't say.
148	00:09:29	00:09:30	Well, we're bringing him in.
149	00:09:30	00:09:33	I'm going to call Nick, and tell him to get his autograph, and maybe we'll get lucky.
150	00:09:37	00:09:38	Hey.
151	00:09:38	00:09:41	Hey.
152	00:09:46	00:09:48	It's a pretty nasty bruise. How'd you get that?
153	00:09:48	00:09:49	I fell.
154	00:09:49	00:09:51	Mm.
155	00:09:58	00:10:01	I want to thank you for calling me when you did, or I wouldn't be here right now.
156	00:10:01	00:10:04	That took a lot of guts.
157	00:10:04	00:10:07	I'm sure there's some people out there who didn't appreciate it.
158	00:10:07	00:10:08	Probably the same people who...
159	00:10:09	00:10:11	put a grenade in my yard.
160	00:10:13	00:10:14	You give me a name...
161	00:10:14	00:10:16	and I can help you.
162	00:10:18	00:10:19	I can't.
163	00:10:19	00:10:21	They will kill me.
164	00:10:27	00:10:28	Dr. Huxbee.
165	00:10:28	00:10:30	Just the guy I wanted to talk to.
166	00:10:30	00:10:32	I'm Jason McCann's legal guardian.
167	00:10:32	00:10:34	I heard you pulled him out of school.
168	00:10:34	00:10:36	Is he under arrest? No.
169	00:10:36	00:10:37	Then he's coming with me.
170	00:10:37	00:10:38	Let's have a little chat first.
171	00:10:38	00:10:40	We have nothing to talk about.
172	00:10:40	00:10:42	Oh, you'd be surprised. Come on.
173	00:10:44	00:10:47	Oh, I saw Jason when he came in.
174	00:10:47	00:10:49	Pretty nasty shiner the kid has.
175	00:10:49	00:10:51	So what happened?
176	00:10:51	00:10:54	He mouthed off, so you laid a little old-fashioned discipline on him?
177	00:10:54	00:10:55	Jason fell...
178	00:10:55	00:10:57	skateboarding.
179	00:10:57	00:11:00	Yeah. Sure.
180	00:11:00	00:11:02	I checked out your file.
181	00:11:02	00:11:04	Before you got your PhD in political theory, you were in the Coast Guard.
182	00:11:04	00:11:08	Must have tied a few bowline hitches back then, huh?
183	00:11:08	00:11:10	Is that where you learned to make bombs?
184	00:11:10	00:11:13	I told you before, I'm opposed to violence. Right.
185	00:11:13	00:11:14	You just make 'em, you don't plant 'em.
186	00:11:14	00:11:17	That's too dangerous, too much shrapnel in the air.
187	00:11:17	00:11:18	Do I need to call my attorney?
188	00:11:18	00:11:20	I came for Jason.
189	00:11:20	00:11:22	Just sign this release.
190	00:11:22	00:11:30	Then you can go back to your public speaking engagements where you trash this country that gives you the freedom to spew all your crap.
191	00:11:35	00:11:41	I know you're between a rock and a hard place here, but I'll protect you.
192	00:11:41	00:11:44	Like you protected my brother, right? Hey, your brother didn't give me a choice, man.
193	00:11:44	00:11:46	You think that makes it hurt any less?
194	00:11:46	00:11:48	Jason.
195	00:11:49	00:11:51	Let's go.
196	00:11:55	00:11:57	Hey, you still have my number.
197	00:12:08	00:12:11	He seems scared, but I can't read him, Jim.
198	00:12:11	00:12:13	You shot his brother.
199	00:12:13	00:12:16	Why would he want to save yourlife?
200	00:12:16	00:12:17	Huh?
201	00:12:18	00:12:20	Grenade fragments had a story to tell.
202	00:12:20	00:12:22	Found trace amounts of benzyl benzoate.
203	00:12:22	00:12:25	Well, that's an acetone; it's not in grenades. Exactly.
204	00:12:25	00:12:29	So if Nick's grenade were military issue, it would have been filled with Comp-B.
205	00:12:29	00:12:33	Acetone-- that's one of the ingredients in triacetone- triperoxide, TATP.
206	00:12:33	00:12:36	That's the same explosive that Jason McCann's brother used to make pipe bombs.
207	00:12:36	00:12:40	So somebody is filling empty grenades instead of pipes.
208	00:12:40	00:12:44	Well, you can buy empty grenades as commemoratives and fill them with any boom you want.
209	00:12:44	00:12:50	Hey. Remember how Huxbee was bragging about living off the grid and ditching his plastic and all that?
210	00:12:50	00:12:58	Yeah. Well, looks like some bank made him an offer for a low-interest credit card even he couldn't refuse.
211	00:12:58	00:13:00	Guy's become a shopaholic.
212	00:13:00	00:13:04	Retail therapy can be very effective in relieving that Armageddon stress.
213	00:13:04	00:13:10	Well, Huxbee's not buying a lot of sterno and camo, but he did buy serious quantities of acetone and pool acid.
214	00:13:10	00:13:12	Maybe he was looking to start his own Armageddon.
215	00:13:23	00:13:28	Thanks for coming. Yeah, I hope we're not wasting your time here, Kip. You kidding? I live for this.
216	00:13:28	00:13:34	So, Dr. Huxbee's old landlord didn't agree with his politics, so he booted him out of the old meeting hall, and Huxbee signed a new lease here.
217	00:13:34	00:13:38	Credit cards, leases-- gets the doc back on the grid.
218	00:13:38	00:13:40	We got an R.O. on this truck?
219	00:13:40	00:13:42	Yeah, it's Huxbee's-- so he must be inside.
220	00:13:43	00:13:45	Dr. Huxbee?
221	00:13:45	00:13:47	LVPD. We have a warrant.
222	00:13:49	00:13:50	Huxbee?
223	00:13:50	00:13:53	We need to talk.
224	00:13:53	00:13:55	Got some blood here.
225	00:14:02	00:14:04	It's Huxbee.
226	00:14:09	00:14:11	He's dead.
227	00:14:11	00:14:14	Guy just sprung Jason McCann from PD; now he's dead?
228	00:14:14	00:14:15	Where's Jason?
229	00:14:18	00:14:21	You know, this scene looks a little too familiar.
230	00:14:21	00:14:24	Dead body in the middle of a room?
231	00:14:25	00:14:27	Body's wired.
232	00:14:27	00:14:28	Are you kidding me?
233	00:14:28	00:14:29	I don't see any explosives.
234	00:14:33	00:14:34	Oh, crap.
235	00:14:42	00:14:43	That can't be good.
236	00:14:43	00:14:44	You think?
237	00:14:44	00:14:45	What is it with you?
238	00:14:45	00:14:47	You some kind of a bomb magnet?
239	00:14:47	00:14:49	All right, guys, let's get out of here.
240	00:14:49	00:14:51	The whole place might be rigged.
241	00:14:51	00:14:53	Retrace your steps.
242	00:14:57	00:14:59	Hang on.
243	00:14:59	00:15:01	What is that? Looks like some kind of sensor.
244	00:15:02	00:15:03	Yeah.
245	00:15:05	00:15:07	You're not gonna like this.
246	00:15:13	00:15:15	One door in, one door out.
247	00:15:15	00:15:18	We're not going anywhere.
248	00:15:26	00:15:30	Control, KA-135. We have a 445 at 3027 Rosemont Boulevard.
249	00:15:30	00:15:32	Control, KA-13...
250	00:15:32	00:15:34	(radio static) Radio's dead.
251	00:15:34	00:15:35	What?
252	00:15:35	00:15:36	Phone, too.
253	00:15:36	00:15:38	Seriously? Must be jamming the signals.
254	00:15:38	00:15:39	Fantastic. We're on our own.
255	00:15:39	00:15:43	Well... come on, man, you're the rock star here.
256	00:15:43	00:15:45	Time to start playing, bud. Let's go.
257	00:15:45	00:15:48	Photo-sensor chip under the DB armed the bombs and lasers.
258	00:15:48	00:15:51	We break any of those beams, that much C-4 is gonna take us all out.
259	00:15:51	00:15:55	We got to diffuse this bad boy.
260	00:15:55	00:15:56	Yeah.
261	00:15:56	00:15:58	How are wegoing to get to it?
262	00:15:58	00:15:59	I'm still working on it.
263	00:16:03	00:16:05	Keyless car entry receiver circuit.
264	00:16:05	00:16:09	Fob transmitter's probably connected to the lasers.
265	00:16:09	00:16:12	That clock say 14 minutes? That's a lifetime.
266	00:16:12	00:16:14	To disarm it, or is that just what we've got left?
267	00:16:14	00:16:17	Both.
268	00:16:17	00:16:29	Dr. Corey, two weeks ago you brought a mobile MRI machine to Ely State Prison to conduct a test on me. Yes. I...
269	00:16:29	00:16:33	scanned your brain while you were shown a series of crime photographs.
270	00:16:33	00:16:36	Describe the photos.
271	00:16:36	00:16:39	They were graphic, uh, extremely violent.
272	00:16:39	00:16:44	Images of mutilated and dismembered bodies.
273	00:16:44	00:16:49	What happens, Doctor, to the average person's brain when they're shown such images?
274	00:16:49	00:16:50	This...
275	00:16:50	00:16:53	is the orbital cortex.
276	00:16:53	00:16:59	It governs, uh, moral decision making, aggression, impulse control.
277	00:16:59	00:17:00	It's lit up like a Christmas tree.
278	00:17:00	00:17:02	It's so beautiful, Doctor.
279	00:17:02	00:17:04	Well, it's because it's being stimulated.
280	00:17:04	00:17:09	Clearly, the, uh, subject was deeply disturbed by the images.
281	00:17:09	00:17:12	And how does this compare to a scan of...
282	00:17:12	00:17:14	myorbital cortex?
283	00:17:14	00:17:16	Well...
284	00:17:16	00:17:20	as you can see, yours is pitch black; there is no activity.
285	00:17:20	00:17:25	Your orbital cortex is profoundly impaired.
286	00:17:29	00:17:32	Doctor, do you know what caused this... this defect?
287	00:17:32	00:17:42	You possess the Monoamine Oxidase A, or MAO-A gene.
288	00:17:42	00:17:48	Otherwise known as the warrior gene, for its association with aggression.
289	00:17:48	00:17:53	Doctor, what is the significance of this warrior gene for someone like me?
290	00:17:53	00:18:05	Well, according to numerous studies, if you suffered severe childhood abuse and possessed this gene, it increases your chances of committing a violent crime by...
291	00:18:05	00:18:07	four hundred percent.
292	00:18:10	00:18:15	Doctor, you complete me, or at least you complete my understanding of me.
293	00:18:15	00:18:17	Objection. I know, counsel is testifying.
294	00:18:17	00:18:18	Sustained, sustained.
295	00:18:18	00:18:26	Mr. Haskell, I've given you a lot of leeway because you're pro per, but if you try to do my job again, I will hold you in contempt.
296	00:18:26	00:18:28	Mea culpa, Your Honor.
297	00:18:28	00:18:36	So, Dr. Corey, it is your expert opinion that I cannot be held responsible for my actions, for any of them?
298	00:18:36	00:18:38	That is correct.
299	00:18:38	00:18:45	So it is true what they say, that I am a monster, buta monster made of biology beyond my control.
300	00:18:45	00:18:51	So convicting me of attempted murder would be like convicting a blind man of being unable to see.
301	00:18:51	00:18:53	Who's the real victim here?!
302	00:18:56	00:18:58	Who's the real victim?
303	00:19:00	00:19:06	Bomb out of reach, clock facing us-- they want us to see how much time we have left, force our hand.
304	00:19:06	00:19:08	Yeah, that's 'cause they're watching us.
305	00:19:08	00:19:10	They want to see us sweat.
306	00:19:12	00:19:15	Yeah, here we go.
307	00:19:20	00:19:24	They've been a step ahead of us this whole time. Yep.
308	00:19:24	00:19:28	Well... they want to play with lasers, I'll give 'em lasers.
309	00:19:36	00:19:38	All right, guys, ideas?
310	00:19:38	00:19:42	Well, we can't go through the beams, so maybe we go over 'em.
311	00:19:42	00:19:45	Yeah, there's plenty of pallets and lumber. Yeah.
312	00:19:45	00:19:47	Yeah, enough to build a stairway to Heaven.
313	00:19:59	00:20:01	Lou!
314	00:20:03	00:20:05	(groaning) You don't want to be next.
315	00:20:05	00:20:09	That goes for you, too, Stokes.
316	00:20:13	00:20:16	Nine-mil cartridges set into the wood.
317	00:20:16	00:20:17	Nails as firing pins.
318	00:20:17	00:20:19	Very smart.
319	00:20:19	00:20:21	Yeah, smarter than me.
320	00:20:21	00:20:25	All right, you're good along that line.
321	00:20:27	00:20:31	It's bad, isn't it?
322	00:20:32	00:20:35	He may have nicked an artery.
323	00:20:35	00:20:37	I'm gonna apply some pressure.
324	00:20:37	00:20:39	Okay. It's gonna hurt.
325	00:20:40	00:20:42	(grunts) Sorry.
326	00:20:42	00:20:44	God, I hate it when you're right.
327	00:20:45	00:20:47	We want to get out here, we better start stacking.
328	00:20:47	00:20:50	All right, you guys go for it. I'm gonna stay with Lou.
329	00:20:50	00:20:51	Careful what you pick up.
330	00:20:51	00:20:53	Yeah, copy that.
331	00:21:02	00:21:05	You should find more compassion in your heart for Nate.
332	00:21:05	00:21:07	The man has a disease. I'm sorry, who are you?
333	00:21:07	00:21:09	I'm Vivian, Nate's fiancée.
334	00:21:09	00:21:11	His one true love.
335	00:21:11	00:21:13	I see. Did Nate give you that pendant?
336	00:21:13	00:21:17	Yes. I wonder if you understand the significance of it.
337	00:21:17	00:21:23	Oh, Nate's a very spiritual man. I was referring to his first two victims, Joel Steiner and Tiffany Cohen.
338	00:21:23	00:21:26	They both wore identical Stars of David.
339	00:21:26	00:21:34	They were two young people very much in love, just starting out in life, when he kidnapped them, murdered Joel, so that he could rape and torture Tiffany at his leisure.
340	00:21:34	00:21:37	Well, you heard that expert; he's not responsible for his actions.
341	00:21:37	00:21:45	Besides, the love of a good woman can change any man. Now, why don't you tell that to the seven women that we found buried under his floorboards?
342	00:21:45	00:21:47	Vivian.
343	00:21:47	00:21:49	Join the prayer circle.
344	00:21:56	00:21:58	I see you've met the Brides of Haskell.
345	00:21:58	00:22:03	They're all wearing identical Stars of David.
346	00:22:03	00:22:05	Well, serial killers have groupies, Ray.
347	00:22:05	00:22:08	Well, they may not be the only ones listening to this psychobabble.
348	00:22:08	00:22:11	You should have seen the jury listening to his expert witness, this Dr. Corey.
349	00:22:11	00:22:17	Haskell's going to try and use the MAO-A defense to get all of his convictions overturned, Jim.
350	00:22:17	00:22:19	That's a long shot, Ray.
351	00:22:19	00:22:21	You heard of Willie Sutton, bank robber, right?
352	00:22:21	00:22:23	Sentenced to over 100 years.
353	00:22:23	00:22:25	Studied civil rights law in jail.
354	00:22:25	00:22:26	Got all of his convictions overturned.
355	00:22:26	00:22:28	He died a free man.
356	00:22:28	00:22:30	Captain Brass?
357	00:22:30	00:22:32	Ready for testimony.
358	00:22:33	00:22:36	Okay, my turn on the hot seat.
359	00:22:36	00:22:39	See you later.
360	00:22:39	00:22:41	Hey, stay with me.
361	00:22:41	00:22:43	We're gonna get you out of here.
362	00:22:43	00:22:45	We're all gonna get out of here.
363	00:22:47	00:22:49	All right, Kip.
364	00:22:49	00:22:50	Once you're in, you're in.
365	00:22:50	00:22:52	You ready, wild man?
366	00:22:52	00:22:55	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
367	00:22:55	00:22:57	If I were you, I'd stick that landing, bud.
368	00:23:04	00:23:07	You're good.
369	00:23:07	00:23:09	You're good.
370	00:23:14	00:23:16	All right.
371	00:23:20	00:23:21	Clock's ticking.
372	00:23:24	00:23:27	Big capacitors.
373	00:23:27	00:23:29	Just a come-on.
374	00:23:29	00:23:32	You know, I don't think Huxbee or Jason McCann pulled this off.
375	00:23:32	00:23:34	You might want to find some shelter.
376	00:23:34	00:23:36	All we got is plywood.
377	00:23:36	00:23:37	That's no good against C-4?
378	00:23:37	00:23:39	It can't hurt.
379	00:23:39	00:23:40	Yeah. All right.
380	00:23:40	00:23:43	I'll be right back.
381	00:23:43	00:23:45	Hey. Hey. We got to get him to cover.
382	00:23:46	00:23:48	Can you sit up for me, Lou? Okay.
383	00:23:48	00:23:49	I got it. Yeah?
384	00:23:49	00:23:52	Aah!
385	00:23:52	00:23:53	Piece of cake.
386	00:23:56	00:23:57	Watch that. (whispers)
387	00:23:57	00:23:58	Stay strong, Lou.
388	00:24:00	00:24:01	Ah, hell.
389	00:24:01	00:24:02	What? What?
390	00:24:02	00:24:03	Mercury switch.
391	00:24:03	00:24:05	That doesn't sound good.
392	00:24:05	00:24:07	Anti-tampering device.
393	00:24:07	00:24:10	Works on gravity.
394	00:24:10	00:24:14	Normally I'd cut the main power, but this baby's got a collapsing circuit.
395	00:24:14	00:24:15	Translation?
396	00:24:15	00:24:19	I cut the power lead, it triggers the bomb.
397	00:24:19	00:24:23	I've got to cut these two conductors separately, make sure the wires don't touch.
398	00:24:23	00:24:24	All right.
399	00:24:24	00:24:26	You get to cover.
400	00:24:26	00:24:27	Hell, no, man. I'm staying right here with you.
401	00:24:27	00:24:29	Ah, you're the wild man.
402	00:24:31	00:24:32	Less than a minute.
403	00:24:32	00:24:34	Plenty of time.
404	00:24:37	00:24:38	45 seconds.
405	00:24:47	00:24:48	First cut.
406	00:24:54	00:24:57	Second cut.
407	00:25:10	00:25:11	It stopped.
408	00:25:11	00:25:16	I hate to disappoint you, Stokes, but you're not dying today.
409	00:25:17	00:25:19	Damn!
410	00:25:19	00:25:21	Good job.
411	00:25:21	00:25:22	Let's get him to a hospital.
412	00:25:22	00:25:24	You're my hero, man.
413	00:25:28	00:25:29	He got it.
414	00:25:29	00:25:31	He got it. We're good. We're good, Lou.
415	00:25:31	00:25:33	Come here. It's all right Yeah.
416	00:25:39	00:25:40	Get down!
417	00:26:04	00:26:06	Over here.
418	00:26:09	00:26:11	I got three people down.
419	00:26:11	00:26:15	One female in a CSI vest. Requesting two additional paramedics.
420	00:26:15	00:26:19	It's okay. We're gonna get you out of here.
421	00:26:19	00:26:22	One of my victims has life-threatening injuries.
422	00:26:22	00:26:25	So Nick and Catherine are all right?
423	00:26:25	00:26:27	And what about Vartann?
424	00:26:27	00:26:31	Good. Listen, Greg, get the name of his attending for me so I can follow up after.
425	00:26:31	00:26:34	Oh, um, batter up. Got to go.
426	00:26:34	00:26:35	Thanks for letting me know.
427	00:26:35	00:26:45	So, as a medical doctor, what is your opinion about Dr. Corey's theory that individuals with the MAO-A gene are predisposed to violence?
428	00:26:45	00:26:48	It is my opinion that it is utter nonsense.
429	00:26:48	00:26:57	Sure, there have been several studies that claim that there's a link between the MAO-A gene and violent behavior, but there are just as many studies that dispute those findings.
430	00:26:57	00:27:00	Dr. Corey's conclusions are not neuroscience.
431	00:27:00	00:27:01	They're neuromythology.
432	00:27:01	00:27:03	Could you give us an example?
433	00:27:03	00:27:14	Alcoholics are genetically predisposed to alcoholism, which is a known disease, but we don't give drunks a pass if they decide to get behind the wheel of a vehicle and kill people.
434	00:27:14	00:27:21	The law is interested in whether or not a person understands the difference between right and wrong, and the defendant knows the difference between right and wrong.
435	00:27:21	00:27:27	He takes pleasure in committing sadistic crimes that he knows are against the law.
436	00:27:27	00:27:32	The fact that he has tried to cover up those crimes is evidence of his consciousness of guilt.
437	00:27:32	00:27:35	No further questions, Your Honor.
438	00:27:36	00:27:39	I have nothing but questions.
439	00:27:39	00:27:45	Dr. Langston, are you a psychiatrist?
440	00:27:45	00:27:48	A neurologist?
441	00:27:48	00:27:51	A geneticist?
442	00:27:51	00:27:53	No. My field is research pathology.
443	00:27:53	00:27:57	Then you have no expertise in this area at all, correct?
444	00:27:57	00:27:59	No?
445	00:27:59	00:28:01	You mean yes.
446	00:28:01	00:28:06	You just testified to a complete lack of credentials.
447	00:28:06	00:28:09	So, on what would you base any expertise?
448	00:28:09	00:28:11	Personal experience.
449	00:28:13	00:28:20	Like you, I was abused by an alcoholic father as a child, and, like you, I have the MAO-A gene.
450	00:28:22	00:28:25	DNA isn't destiny.
451	00:28:25	00:28:27	We're all responsible for our own actions.
452	00:28:29	00:28:32	I share the same gene with you, Nate, but I've never murdered anyone.
453	00:28:32	00:28:37	I take satisfaction in bringing justice to victims, not killing them and torturing them.
454	00:28:37	00:28:42	Which is the only way that you can feel any connection to another human being.
455	00:28:48	00:28:51	Don't you think that was a little below the belt, Ray?
456	00:29:01	00:29:02	Welcome back.
457	00:29:02	00:29:05	The doctors patched you up.
458	00:29:05	00:29:07	You're going to be okay.
459	00:29:07	00:29:09	But Kip didn't make it.
460	00:29:12	00:29:13	Did we get 'em?
461	00:29:13	00:29:16	We will.
462	00:29:16	00:29:18	Thanks...
463	00:29:18	00:29:20	for being here.
464	00:29:20	00:29:22	Where else would I be?
465	00:29:24	00:29:25	You get some rest.
466	00:29:25	00:29:27	I'll be back.
467	00:29:27	00:29:29	Okay.
468	00:29:35	00:29:37	How's he doing?
469	00:29:37	00:29:40	Good, I think.
470	00:29:40	00:29:42	How you doing?
471	00:29:42	00:29:44	I'm still in one piece.
472	00:29:44	00:29:47	Yeah, you should probably get checked out anyway.
473	00:29:47	00:29:48	That's usually my line.
474	00:29:50	00:29:53	(laughs) Hey, you're always taking care of me.
475	00:29:55	00:29:58	How about I take care of you for a change?
476	00:29:58	00:30:00	Okay.
477	00:30:03	00:30:06	Thanks, Nicky.
478	00:30:09	00:30:16	Sometime between being bludgeoned and the postmortem blast injuries, Huxbee managed to get himself shot in the head.
479	00:30:16	00:30:17	Single GSW, execution style.
480	00:30:17	00:30:20	Were you able to recover the bullet?
481	00:30:20	00:30:21	Nine millimeter hollow-point.
482	00:30:21	00:30:23	Ballistics sent over a report.
483	00:30:23	00:30:24	Hmm.
484	00:30:24	00:30:26	Gunshot was overkill.
485	00:30:26	00:30:29	Blunt force trauma was the cause of death.
486	00:30:29	00:30:31	IBIS hit.
487	00:30:31	00:30:36	The same gun was used in a break-in at a National Guard armory in Salt Lake nine months ago.
488	00:30:36	00:30:37	What did they take?
489	00:30:37	00:30:39	Couple of M-9s...
490	00:30:39	00:30:42	Wow. 20 pounds of C-4.
491	00:30:42	00:30:46	You know, the armory is not our only link to the military.
492	00:30:46	00:30:49	I ran the serial number on the camera from the warehouse.
493	00:30:49	00:30:54	It was purchased two years ago at an Army PX in Black Rock Arsenal, Virginia.
494	00:30:54	00:30:56	The buyer paid cash.
495	00:30:56	00:31:00	Maybe at the PX in Virginia, but not at Meyer's Hardware Store in North Las Vegas.
496	00:31:00	00:31:03	I just ran Huxbee's recent credit card purchases.
497	00:31:03	00:31:05	Guess who swiped his plastic.
498	00:31:07	00:31:09	That's definitely Jason McCann on the left.
499	00:31:09	00:31:12	Using Huxbee's card, or a card he took out in his name.
500	00:31:12	00:31:15	To buy bomb-making materials.
501	00:31:15	00:31:19	Okay, so, Mr. Non-Violence loses his temper, gives Jason the back of his hand.
502	00:31:19	00:31:20	Explains Jason's bruise in P.D.
503	00:31:20	00:31:25	Then Huxbee springs him, tells Jason that he's a threat to their movement.
504	00:31:25	00:31:26	It's got to stop.
505	00:31:26	00:31:28	So Jason decides Huxbee'sgot to stop.
506	00:31:28	00:31:29	Breathing, that is.
507	00:31:29	00:31:32	We know that he didn't make the bomb alone.
508	00:31:32	00:31:34	Let's push in on this guy.
509	00:31:34	00:31:38	Army field jacket.
510	00:31:38	00:31:41	Think the guy's dumb enough to wear a jacket with his name on it?
511	00:31:41	00:31:45	Let's check him against all personnel at Black Rock Arsenal for the last two years.
512	00:31:48	00:31:52	Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict?
513	00:31:52	00:31:54	We have, Your Honor.
514	00:32:10	00:32:16	In the case of Nathaniel Haskell, Case Number 20433, Clark County Criminal Court.
515	00:32:16	00:32:21	As to the count of attempted murder, the jury finds the defendant guilty.
516	00:32:28	00:32:30	It's an injustice.
517	00:32:30	00:32:32	The whole world is watching.
518	00:32:32	00:32:35	Sentencing will be on February 28.
519	00:32:35	00:32:38	This court is now adjourned.
520	00:32:45	00:32:47	Well done.
521	00:32:47	00:32:48	Thanks to you.
522	00:33:02	00:33:09	So, Greg was able to I.D. the guy in the hardware store with Jason McCann.
523	00:33:09	00:33:12	His name is Timothy Johnson.
524	00:33:12	00:33:15	Specialty 89 Delta?
525	00:33:15	00:33:18	That's explosive ordinance disposal. Yeah.
526	00:33:18	00:33:20	And a less-than-honorable discharge two years ago.
527	00:33:20	00:33:24	According to Nevada DMV, he owns a maroon Chevy van.
528	00:33:24	00:33:25	Jason's been playing me this whole time.
529	00:33:25	00:33:33	Calling me, acting like he's trying to save my life was just bait to get me, Catherine and Vartann in that building at the same time, so he could blow us all to smithereens.
530	00:33:33	00:33:35	And Kip's the one who paid for it.
531	00:33:35	00:33:37	You know, it was all three who took his brother down.
532	00:33:37	00:33:39	Damn! How could I not see that, Sara?
533	00:33:39	00:33:41	Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
534	00:33:41	00:33:42	You saw the tripwire.
535	00:33:42	00:33:44	That's the important thing.
536	00:33:44	00:33:46	You know what I want to know?
537	00:33:46	00:33:49	Is Jason pulling the strings, or is someone else pulling hisstrings?
538	00:33:49	00:33:51	Well, we thought it was Huxbee.
539	00:33:51	00:33:52	It's got to be this dude, Johnson.
540	00:33:52	00:33:54	Well, we got to find them; they still have a lot of C-4.
541	00:33:54	00:33:56	(sighs) Okay, what about that DMV address?
542	00:33:56	00:33:58	It's no good. Greg ran it.
543	00:33:58	00:34:00	The guy used an abandoned house; it's the end of the line.
544	00:34:00	00:34:02	Maybe not.
545	00:34:02	00:34:04	Kids and their phones.
546	00:34:04	00:34:05	That dumb-ass called me.
547	00:34:05	00:34:07	I think he deserves a call back, don't you?
548	00:34:13	00:34:15	Hello?
549	00:34:15	00:34:16	Hey, Jason.
550	00:34:16	00:34:17	It's Nick Stokes. How's it going?
551	00:34:18	00:34:22	Bet you weren't expecting to hear from me, were you?
552	00:34:22	00:34:23	No, actually, I wasn't.
553	00:34:23	00:34:27	Maybe we should just continue our conversation right now, what do you think?
554	00:34:27	00:34:28	I mean, we were interrupted.
555	00:34:28	00:34:30	I think we have a lot to talk about, don't you?
556	00:34:34	00:34:35	Jason.
557	00:34:39	00:34:41	Come on, talk to me, you little punk.
558	00:34:44	00:34:45	I don't think he likes you anymore.
559	00:34:45	00:34:48	Oh, he's gonna like me a lot less, believe me.
560	00:34:48	00:34:49	I got the cell tower.
561	00:34:49	00:34:53	CT-16, south receiver, 22 miles west of Searchlight.
562	00:34:53	00:34:55	Not too many people out there.
563	00:34:55	00:34:59	Probably not a lot of maroon vans, either.
564	00:35:09	00:35:11	Captain Brass, Air One here.
565	00:35:11	00:35:12	Got a visual?
566	00:35:12	00:35:13	Affirmative.
567	00:35:13	00:35:17	Maroon van, two WMA's matching suspect's description.
568	00:35:17	00:35:19	Hang back. Maintain visual.
569	00:35:19	00:35:20	This is Charlie-O-five.
570	00:35:20	00:35:21	What's their position, Air One?
571	00:35:21	00:35:24	Just turning west onto State Route 164.
572	00:35:24	00:35:27	Hey, they're headed for California, Jim.
573	00:35:27	00:35:30	We take 95 south, we can cut 'em off.
574	00:35:30	00:35:32	Just try to keep up.
575	00:35:37	00:35:39	The last cage on the left.
576	00:35:39	00:35:40	Thank you.
577	00:35:47	00:35:49	Hi, Ray.
578	00:35:49	00:35:50	You...
579	00:35:50	00:35:53	were magnificent on the witness stand.
580	00:35:53	00:35:56	That MAO-A revelation of yours...
581	00:35:56	00:36:01	Delightfully unexpected. You know, a good lawyer never asks a question that he doesn't have the answer to.
582	00:36:01	00:36:03	Beware the sin of pride, Ray.
583	00:36:03	00:36:09	But I feel it was a positive experience, because now I feel even closer to you.
584	00:36:09	00:36:12	Discovering we share more than just your kidney.
585	00:36:12	00:36:13	Do you have chills, Ray?
586	00:36:13	00:36:15	No. Steady.
587	00:36:15	00:36:18	Calm.
588	00:36:18	00:36:19	Question, though.
589	00:36:19	00:36:24	How long have you known that you were an MAO-A gene carrier?
590	00:36:24	00:36:27	You heard Dr. Corey, Ray-- months, maybe...
591	00:36:27	00:36:30	maybe longer. No, you must have known before your first kill.
592	00:36:30	00:36:33	My first humankill.
593	00:36:33	00:36:36	You talk about a good excuse to start having some fun, huh?
594	00:36:36	00:36:39	Oh, Ray...
595	00:36:39	00:36:41	it's like a mirror with you. (chuckles)
596	00:36:41	00:36:43	It's like playing with myself, only...
597	00:36:43	00:36:45	better.
598	00:36:45	00:36:50	So, how long have you known? Ray, you know my job history and that I never, ever had one in my life.
599	00:36:50	00:36:52	So I had to have income.
600	00:36:52	00:36:58	Blood donations, sperm bank, the odd psychological research study-- those cute grad students, they pay good money.
601	00:36:58	00:37:02	The first studies on the MAO-A gene didn't happen until the 1970s.
602	00:37:02	00:37:03	How did you know, Nate?
603	00:37:03	00:37:09	I wanted to be the first kid on my block to have one, Ray, so I could blame everything on my father.
604	00:37:09	00:37:13	I just prayed to God to bring me one of those genes, Ray.
605	00:37:13	00:37:14	You can't alter your DNA.
606	00:37:14	00:37:16	You either have the gene or you don't.
607	00:37:19	00:37:20	Trust me, Ray...
608	00:37:20	00:37:23	if you want something bad enough, you can will it to happen.
609	00:37:23	00:37:25	Look at those women; they fight over me, Ray.
610	00:37:25	00:37:26	It's 'cause I will it.
611	00:37:26	00:37:33	You're really giving yourself a little bit too much credit. No, I'm a chick magnet, Ray, and you know that. You're a magnet for the walking wounded.
612	00:37:33	00:37:35	Look at you in this cage.
613	00:37:35	00:37:36	You're pathetic.
614	00:37:38	00:37:40	Whatever.
615	00:37:40	00:37:44	You know what I dream of more than sex, Ray?
616	00:37:44	00:37:46	What?
617	00:37:47	00:37:49	Freedom.
618	00:37:49	00:37:51	I bet you do.
619	00:37:53	00:37:55	You've killed 14 people.
620	00:37:55	00:37:59	There's no gene that's gonna magically make you free, not for that.
621	00:37:59	00:38:03	Power of positive thinking, Ray.
622	00:38:03	00:38:07	And I'm very positive.
623	00:38:19	00:38:21	I thought you were smarter than your brother, huh?
624	00:38:21	00:38:23	But you had to make it personal.
625	00:38:23	00:38:24	It's always been personal.
626	00:38:24	00:38:26	They killed my brother; now they're gonna pay.
627	00:38:26	00:38:28	Well, you think you're the only guy who lost someone?
628	00:38:28	00:38:37	I've had more friends bleed out in my arms in the middle of a damn sandbox than I can count, but at least I know what I'm fighting for-- real freedom. Stop talking to me like I am some kid.
629	00:38:37	00:38:38	I brought you in!
630	00:38:38	00:38:40	I taught you everything, you little punk!
631	00:38:40	00:38:48	Not just how to make bombs but how to bring this freedom fight home, stay alive, live to fight another day and not go strength against strength and take on the whole damn LVPD.
632	00:38:48	00:38:50	You're just gonna get us killed, kid.
633	00:38:50	00:38:51	I'm not afraid.
634	00:38:54	00:38:57	Stop the car. Stop the car!
635	00:39:04	00:39:06	What are you doing? Run it!
636	00:39:06	00:39:07	Shut the hell up.
637	00:39:10	00:39:13	Johnson! McCann! Get out of the car!
638	00:39:18	00:39:19	I'm not dying today.
639	00:39:19	00:39:22	Don't quit on me.
640	00:39:22	00:39:27	Throw your weapons out the window, and step out of the car now.
641	00:39:27	00:39:28	Got no choice. Look at all those guns.
642	00:39:28	00:39:30	You're surrounded!
643	00:39:30	00:39:31	Get out of the car!
644	00:39:31	00:39:34	I'll give up, but only to Stokes.
645	00:39:34	00:39:36	Don't even think about it.
646	00:39:36	00:39:38	Yeah, I'm right here.
647	00:39:38	00:39:41	So give up. I want to talk to you.
648	00:39:41	00:39:42	We'll talk. Get out of there!
649	00:39:42	00:39:44	Jase, look at me.
650	00:39:44	00:39:46	Live to fight another day, remember?
651	00:39:47	00:39:49	Get out.
652	00:39:49	00:39:51	I'm coming out!
653	00:39:57	00:40:01	Get your hands on your head, turn around and get down on your knees!
654	00:40:01	00:40:02	Get down on your knees!
655	00:40:06	00:40:07	McCann, get out of the car!
656	00:40:07	00:40:10	Throw the weapon out!
657	00:40:18	00:40:19	Hands on your head!
658	00:40:19	00:40:20	Get down on your knees!
659	00:40:20	00:40:22	He's wired! He's got a bomb!
660	00:40:22	00:40:24	He's lying! There's no bomb! Look! Don't shoot!
661	00:40:24	00:40:25	Don't shoot! No!
662	00:40:32	00:40:33	Hold your fire.
663	00:41:24	00:41:26	I need to see Nate Haskell.
664	00:41:26	00:41:28	I need to see him right away. Okay.
665	00:41:29	00:41:31	Hey, Haskell?
666	00:41:31	00:41:33	Your buddy's...
667	00:41:33	00:41:34	What the...?
668	00:41:34	00:41:35	Hey, inmate, get up.
669	00:41:35	00:41:39	Show us your wrist band.
670	00:41:39	00:41:41	He switched them.
671	00:41:41	00:41:42	So where is he?
672	00:41:42	00:41:47	A minimum-security van just left about ten minutes ago.
673	00:42:18	00:42:20	Nate! Now we can finally...
674	00:42:24	00:42:27	Let's take my car.
675	00:42:28	00:42:30	Oh, your hands are so cold.
676	00:42:30	00:42:31	Oh, we'll fix that.
677	00:42:31	00:42:33	Let's get out of here! Come on!
678	00:42:39	00:42:41	Come on.
