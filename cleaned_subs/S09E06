0,00:00:04,00:00:10,(woman singing upbeat pop song in Korean)
1,00:00:15,00:00:16,Hi!
2,00:00:20,00:00:22,(song continues over lively conversation in Korean)
3,00:00:33,00:00:35,(meat sizzling)
4,00:00:49,00:00:51,"(gunshot, girl gasps)"
5,00:00:51,00:00:52,"(people screaming, shouting)"
6,00:00:53,00:00:54,(gunshot)
7,00:00:54,00:00:55,(people screaming)
8,00:00:55,00:00:56,(clinking)
9,00:00:56,00:00:59,(gunshot)
10,00:01:01,00:01:03,(speaking Korean)
11,00:01:11,00:01:14,"(two gunshots, panicked screams)"
12,00:01:29,00:01:32,"(screaming, shrieking)"
13,00:01:37,00:01:39,Did you see anything?
14,00:01:39,00:01:40,(speaking Korean)
15,00:01:40,00:01:42,"Okay, hold on; hold on."
16,00:01:42,00:01:45,Look at me. Look at me.
17,00:01:45,00:01:46,I don't know.
18,00:01:46,00:01:48,Did you see this? Did you hear anything?
19,00:01:48,00:01:49,You just ran over there?
20,00:01:49,00:01:50,(speaking Korean)
21,00:01:50,00:01:52,No.
22,00:01:52,00:01:54,Did you see it? (scoffs)
23,00:01:54,00:01:57,"PHILLIPS: Three holes in the male, two holes in the female."
24,00:02:01,00:02:02,(camera clicks)
25,00:02:02,00:02:05,"Five holes, one casing."
26,00:02:05,00:02:10,"But with all this foot traffic, the other shells could be anywhere."
27,00:02:13,00:02:15,There's no I.D. or anything on the female.
28,00:02:15,00:02:20,But... we do have a big bulge right here.
29,00:02:28,00:02:30,Got a license.
30,00:02:30,00:02:33,Vic's name is Sung Bang.
31,00:02:37,00:02:41,"Apparently, his day started a lot better than it ended."
32,00:02:41,00:02:43,Prison release forms.
33,00:02:43,00:02:47,Spent six months in Jean for repeat DUIs.
34,00:02:47,00:02:49,Walked out today.
35,00:02:49,00:02:52,It's weird-- the female vic doesn't even have a lint in her pocket.
36,00:02:52,00:02:54,"This guy, it's an I.D. orgasm."
37,00:02:55,00:02:56,Overload.
38,00:02:56,00:02:58,I meant I.D. overload.
39,00:03:01,00:03:04,Must have been at least a dozen people within ten feet of the victims.
40,00:03:04,00:03:10,"Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna learn much from this crowd. Tells me we're probably looking for a Korean."
41,00:03:10,00:03:17,"If the killer had been black, white or brown, we'd already have height, weight hair and tattoos."
42,00:03:17,00:03:19,Smells like a gang hit.
43,00:03:30,00:03:35,I found a pair of kid's sunglasses with blood spatter all over them.
44,00:03:35,00:03:38,Prints and smudges.
45,00:03:41,00:03:43,He must have been standing right here.
46,00:03:43,00:03:45,He would have seen everything.
47,00:03:45,00:03:47,"If it was me, I would've run."
48,00:03:47,00:03:48,The killer could've taken him.
49,00:03:48,00:03:54,"Either way, he's missing, and we have to find this child before something happens to him."
50,00:04:26,00:04:31,"The incident shattered the calm in Koreatown, where partiers were celebrating until the violence broke out."
51,00:04:31,00:04:36,"Officers have been unable to identify the female victim, and that's holding things up."
52,00:04:37,00:04:46,"The investigators say they're hampered by a language barrier, and their job is also complicated by the fact that many of the partygoers distrust or even fear the police."
53,00:04:46,00:04:48,(man speaking Korean)
54,00:04:48,00:04:51,"(indistinct, overlapping crowd chatter)"
55,00:05:05,00:05:07,"WOMAN: I don't know, I don't know."
56,00:05:07,00:05:09,MAN: That is all I know.
57,00:05:09,00:05:10,"All right, thanks. You're free to go."
58,00:05:11,00:05:12,Next.
59,00:05:12,00:05:16,(man speaking Korean)
60,00:05:16,00:05:19,How's it going?
61,00:05:27,00:05:32,"Sir, how close were you standing to the victims?"
62,00:05:32,00:05:35,"If you speak English, now would be a good time to start."
63,00:05:36,00:05:41,"If it's gonna get me out of here quicker, I'll be William freakin' Shakespeare."
64,00:05:41,00:05:46,"From what I understand, the Korean culture's very big on respect."
65,00:05:49,00:05:52,(weary sigh): Yeah.
66,00:05:55,00:06:01,So how about giving maximum respect to the two people who were murdered and tell me what you saw?
67,00:06:02,00:06:03,(wry laugh)
68,00:06:03,00:06:04,"You know, I like your style."
69,00:06:04,00:06:12,"Yeah, I give you all the forensics you want-- a Q-Tip in the mouth; you can have my ass prints if you want, but don't ask me what happened."
70,00:06:12,00:06:15,"It's not my business, so I shouldn't be flapping about it."
71,00:06:16,00:06:20,"So you think that's real, too, letting murderers run free?"
72,00:06:22,00:06:24,We know it's a gang thing.
73,00:06:26,00:06:28,"You don't need me then, do you?"
74,00:06:31,00:06:35,ROBBINS: Male C.O.D. is exsanguinations due to multiple GSWs.
75,00:06:35,00:06:36,Same with the female.
76,00:06:36,00:06:39,Exsanguinations due to multiple GSWs.
77,00:06:39,00:06:42,The bullets in the male were cannelured.
78,00:06:42,00:06:44,He was shot with a revolver.
79,00:06:44,00:06:47,Female was shot twice with a semiautomatic.
80,00:06:47,00:06:49,"Two guns, two killers?"
81,00:06:49,00:06:52,"Or one killer, two guns, gangsta style."
82,00:06:52,00:06:59,"Well, his shots seem fairly straight and level, but it looks like the bullets entered her at a much steeper trajectory."
83,00:06:59,00:07:02,"Yeah, approximately 20 degrees up, front to back."
84,00:07:02,00:07:12,"So, what, He gets gunned down, she's terrified, tries to flee and then falls down as she's shot, exaggerating the trajectory?"
85,00:07:15,00:07:16,Could be a drug thing.
86,00:07:18,00:07:21,She's got the needle marks to prove it.
87,00:07:23,00:07:25,I sent blood and tissue samples to Tox.
88,00:07:28,00:07:31,GRISSOM: This is an odd-looking scar...
89,00:07:31,00:07:33,on both eyelids.
90,00:07:33,00:07:34,Could be cosmetic surgery.
91,00:07:35,00:07:38,"She's a little young for a facelift, don't you think?"
92,00:07:38,00:07:44,"GRISSOM: Attractive girl on drugs, on the street with an ex-con and no I.D."
93,00:07:44,00:07:46,Sounds like a street hooker.
94,00:07:46,00:07:50,"Yeah, but not someone who pays for plastic surgery."
95,00:07:50,00:07:54,"ROBBINS: Well, maybe it's a business investment, courtesy of her pimp."
96,00:07:54,00:07:59,"ADAMS: So he's unmarried with no children and apart from the DUIs, clean record."
97,00:07:59,00:08:01,No known gang affiliation.
98,00:08:02,00:08:11,He was at Dempsey's Department Store a half an hour before he was shot and was released from Jean an hour before that.
99,00:08:11,00:08:15,Jean is a 45-minute bus ride to Vegas.
100,00:08:15,00:08:22,"So this guy gets out of jail and in under the running time ofThe Godfather,he's dead."
101,00:08:24,00:08:27,"Well, a lot of people die at the end ofGodfather."
102,00:08:33,00:08:35,Riley ran all the bullets and casings from the scene.
103,00:08:35,00:08:36,Gun is clean.
104,00:08:37,00:08:38,Any I.D. on the female?
105,00:08:38,00:08:41,"No, but she had a blepharoplasty."
106,00:08:41,00:08:45,"Asian eyelid procedure fairly common in Korea and apparently catching on here, too."
107,00:08:45,00:08:48,Brass passed the vic's photo around Makeover Town.
108,00:08:48,00:08:50,Makeover Town? L.A.?
109,00:08:50,00:08:53,"No, it's a block of plastic surgeons in our Koreatown."
110,00:08:53,00:08:55,Our Koreatown isa block.
111,00:08:55,00:08:57,Maybe that's why he was able to find a doctor.
112,00:08:57,00:09:00,MAN: I didn't know her name.
113,00:09:00,00:09:04,"BRASS: You put a woman under anesthesia, you cut her open, and you don't know her name?"
114,00:09:04,00:09:06,"Sir, she was not an ordinary client."
115,00:09:06,00:09:15,"So they forced you at gunpoint to perform eye surgery on women in a procedure that Westernizes their appearance, resulting in an effect called ""round eyes""?"
116,00:09:15,00:09:20,"Ever since Jackie Chan got his eyes done, the surgery's been very popular."
117,00:09:20,00:09:22,And then they just left?
118,00:09:22,00:09:26,"Yes, after they forced me to agree to give them 15% of my profits."
119,00:09:26,00:09:27,"I'm gonna need names, Doctor."
120,00:09:27,00:09:29,They didn't leave any business cards.
121,00:09:32,00:09:35,I think they belong to a group called The KD.
122,00:09:35,00:09:36,The Kkangpae Dragons.
123,00:09:36,00:09:38,I never heard of.
124,00:09:38,00:09:40,And there isn't much in Vegas I haven't heard of.
125,00:09:40,00:09:41,A new outfit.
126,00:09:41,00:09:45,They don't have any tattoos or drive lowriders or spray graffiti.
127,00:09:45,00:09:47,They don't even sell drugs.
128,00:09:47,00:09:51,"So what do they do, just force plastic surgeons to operate on their prostitutes?"
129,00:09:51,00:09:54,Extortion is their trade. They just take. Right.
130,00:09:54,00:09:56,And they take from their own because they know their own.
131,00:09:56,00:09:58,They know that their own won't turn them in.
132,00:09:58,00:10:00,"Well, you're very courageous to come in and report this."
133,00:10:00,00:10:02,Why won't others come forward?
134,00:10:02,00:10:05,You want a bunch of immigrants to come to the police?
135,00:10:05,00:10:10,Why don't you protect them the way you protect the tourists on the Strip and the big shots in Anthem and Seven Hills?
136,00:10:10,00:10:12,Save the stump speech for when you run for mayor.
137,00:10:12,00:10:13,I'll vote for you.
138,00:10:14,00:10:15,Are you still paying extortion?
139,00:10:15,00:10:17,"No, not anymore."
140,00:10:17,00:10:20,"Six months ago, I joined an HMO."
141,00:10:20,00:10:24,And they installed several security cameras around my building.
142,00:10:24,00:10:26,The Dragons don't like to be seen.
143,00:10:26,00:10:28,They prefer to be invisible.
144,00:10:28,00:10:30,"CAVALIERE: Excuse me, Captain."
145,00:10:30,00:10:31,We got a surveillance hit.
146,00:10:31,00:10:34,CSI said there were no surveillance cameras at the crime scene.
147,00:10:34,00:10:37,Hit didn't come from CSI.
148,00:10:37,00:10:43,One of my video analysts caught news of your double in Koreatown and recognized the male vic while scanning one of our video feeds.
149,00:10:43,00:10:46,from a unrelated shoplifting investigation.
150,00:10:46,00:10:47,Wow.
151,00:10:47,00:10:49,Video analyst?
152,00:10:49,00:10:52,"Yeah, why? What do you call them?"
153,00:11:00,00:11:02,(keypad beeping)
154,00:11:02,00:11:09,"""Forensic Services."" (Willows chuckles)"
155,00:11:09,00:11:12,Must have a hell of a shoplifting problem.
156,00:11:12,00:11:19,"We're in a high crime area, and this facility represents a corporate mission to prevent theft, fraud and personal injury in our stores."
157,00:11:19,00:11:23,"BRASS: You're not outsourcing that to China, too, are you?"
158,00:11:23,00:11:25,"All right, Artie, bring it up."
159,00:11:25,00:11:28,"You know, what's your solve rate on property crime these days?"
160,00:11:28,00:11:30,One in ten? One in 20?
161,00:11:30,00:11:33,"Hey, you didn't tell me we were going to have a quiz."
162,00:11:33,00:11:34,"You know, we nail 93%."
163,00:11:34,00:11:40,"Nationwide, Dempsey's Forensic Services has put three fugitives behind bars; we're going to be in 300 locations by next summer."
164,00:11:40,00:11:46,"BRASS: Hey, look, you know, if it, uh, if it's legal and makes my job easier, I'm all for it."
165,00:11:46,00:11:48,There's our guy.
166,00:11:48,00:11:49,Sung Bang.
167,00:11:49,00:11:51,Archie...
168,00:11:51,00:11:55,Artie... could you enhance the image of the boy?
169,00:11:55,00:11:58,"(typing, then computer trills)"
170,00:11:58,00:11:59,WILLOWS: Wow.
171,00:11:59,00:12:01,You've got some really great cameras.
172,00:12:01,00:12:03,Good as any on the Strip.
173,00:12:03,00:12:06,"In fact, our crime lab is better equipped than most in the country."
174,00:12:06,00:12:09,"Now, that's a crime."
175,00:12:09,00:12:11,WILLOWS: We're going to need that toy.
176,00:12:11,00:12:12,Mindy?
177,00:12:12,00:12:13,The toy and the lift.
178,00:12:15,00:12:18,We didn't bother running it through AFIS.
179,00:12:18,00:12:21,"He's obviously under 14 years old, so he wouldn't be in the database."
180,00:12:21,00:12:23,"We, uh, licensed it from the Feds."
181,00:12:23,00:12:25,"Loupe, please."
182,00:12:25,00:12:27,Thank you.
183,00:12:34,00:12:36,This is the same boy.
184,00:12:36,00:12:37,Is that the vic's kid?
185,00:12:37,00:12:41,"BRASS: From everything we know, Sung Bang had no children."
186,00:12:41,00:12:45,He sure looks like the happy dad to me.
187,00:12:50,00:12:54,BRASS: This is the last footage of Sung Bang leaving Dempsey's Department Store.
188,00:12:54,00:12:55,Who's the kid?
189,00:12:55,00:12:57,The boy's name is Park Bang.
190,00:12:57,00:12:59,Sung is his uncle.
191,00:12:59,00:13:01,You positive?
192,00:13:01,00:13:03,I've been Park's CPS investigator for over two years.
193,00:13:03,00:13:05,I know what he looks like.
194,00:13:05,00:13:08,Okay. Who's this?
195,00:13:08,00:13:09,Uh...
196,00:13:09,00:13:11,Here. Come over in the light.
197,00:13:14,00:13:15,(switch clicks)
198,00:13:17,00:13:20,Her name's Kora Sil.
199,00:13:20,00:13:21,Park's mother.
200,00:13:22,00:13:23,Poor boy has lost everyone.
201,00:13:24,00:13:25,What about his father? Dead.
202,00:13:25,00:13:28,He was supposedly some big gangster here and in Korea.
203,00:13:28,00:13:30,The Kkangpae Dragons?
204,00:13:30,00:13:33,I don't know. I never actually met him.
205,00:13:33,00:13:34,He died of AIDS a few years ago.
206,00:13:35,00:13:37,That's when Sung took over the father role.
207,00:13:37,00:13:40,"In fact, it was Sung who notified us about Kora's drug use."
208,00:13:40,00:13:43,He loved that boy.
209,00:13:43,00:13:45,"You know, CSI did a tox panel on the mother."
210,00:13:45,00:13:46,Came back positive for HIV.
211,00:13:46,00:13:48,What's the boy's status? Do you know?
212,00:13:48,00:13:50,He's also HIV positive.
213,00:13:50,00:13:54,"Park's on a very strict drug regimen, so we need to find him immediately."
214,00:13:54,00:13:57,"Well, I mean, the drug regimen may be the least of his problems."
215,00:13:57,00:14:02,"I think the gang killed his uncle and his mother, he saw it; he may already be dead."
216,00:14:04,00:14:05,(sighs heavily)
217,00:14:06,00:14:07,WILLOWS: Our girl has done time.
218,00:14:07,00:14:09,Three months for prostitution.
219,00:14:09,00:14:11,Three months?
220,00:14:11,00:14:12,That's pretty harsh for Vegas.
221,00:14:12,00:14:14,Prostitution with HIV.
222,00:14:14,00:14:17,That's like pointing a gun and pulling the trigger.
223,00:14:17,00:14:18,Any last-knowns?
224,00:14:18,00:14:19,Over a dozen.
225,00:14:19,00:14:21,She's moved around a lot.
226,00:14:21,00:14:24,PD's running them down.
227,00:14:24,00:14:27,Kora Sil's Friend Agenda page.
228,00:14:27,00:14:30,Single... Born in Seoul...
229,00:14:30,00:14:34,Likes rap music... doesn't drink or smoke...
230,00:14:34,00:14:37,But likes to shoot drugs and turn tricks with HIV.
231,00:14:37,00:14:38,"Well, it's always something, isn't it?"
232,00:14:38,00:14:42,Let's check the IP address of the last comment she posted. Yeah.
233,00:14:49,00:14:52,"JOHNSON: Well, looks like she's using this page to score drugs."
234,00:14:52,00:14:54,Welcome to the dark side of social networking.
235,00:14:54,00:15:00,JOHNSON: Okay. The IP address... is...
236,00:15:03,00:15:04,What a surprise.
237,00:15:04,00:15:06,Koreatown.
238,00:15:07,00:15:09,MAN: Of course I know Kora.
239,00:15:09,00:15:10,But why do you ask?
240,00:15:10,00:15:11,We're looking for her son.
241,00:15:12,00:15:13,Why would Park be here?
242,00:15:13,00:15:16,We're going to take a look around.
243,00:15:17,00:15:18,That's a field I.D.
244,00:15:18,00:15:21,We photograph every person of interest in a case.
245,00:15:21,00:15:22,It's standard procedure.
246,00:15:22,00:15:24,I have no reason to lie to you.
247,00:15:24,00:15:25,I know Park and Kora.
248,00:15:25,00:15:27,They come over to use my computer.
249,00:15:27,00:15:33,"Mr. Pan, you don't strike me as the kind of guy who would have nefarious individuals in your home."
250,00:15:33,00:15:35,"Captain Brass, may we talk outside?"
251,00:15:35,00:15:36,No.
252,00:15:39,00:15:44,(speaking Korean)
253,00:15:44,00:15:47,I've known Park's father his entire life.
254,00:15:47,00:15:51,"We came over from Korea together, but we went in different directions."
255,00:15:51,00:15:55,"But I still treat his family as my own, and if they want to use my computer, I let them."
256,00:15:55,00:15:56,There's nothing wrong with that.
257,00:15:57,00:15:58,"No, I'll tell you what's wrong."
258,00:15:58,00:16:00,"The young woman Kora is dead, and her son Park is missing."
259,00:16:00,00:16:04,"Now, this crime happened about a block from where you live."
260,00:16:04,00:16:06,I can't believe you haven't heard about this.
261,00:16:06,00:16:10,I had no idea. I was in Phoenix on business.
262,00:16:10,00:16:12,"Oh. Phoenix, huh? House is clear, sir."
263,00:16:12,00:16:14,"Thanks, Kwan."
264,00:16:14,00:16:16,Do you have any idea where Park might be?
265,00:16:16,00:16:19,No. No. I don't know. I... I'm truly sorry.
266,00:16:19,00:16:22,"Okay, look. Here's my card."
267,00:16:22,00:16:26,Call me if you hear or see anything that may be useful to me.
268,00:16:26,00:16:28,Thanks for your cooperation.
269,00:16:28,00:16:31,Sorry for the inconvenience.
270,00:16:36,00:16:43,Park Bang left Dempsey's Department Store at around 4:00 p.m. with a shopping bag full of stuff his uncle just bought him.
271,00:16:43,00:16:50,"The shooting occurred here about a half an hour later, and that's only a couple blocks away; the uncle doesn't have a car, so..."
272,00:16:50,00:16:55,"they probably walked, using one of these routes."
273,00:16:58,00:17:00,What's on that receipt again?
274,00:17:00,00:17:08,"Uh... T-shirt, novelty sunglasses, Crunchies, Double Fudge, Fruit Funzies and Nutty Cups. Nothing says ""I love you"" like processed sugar."
275,00:17:09,00:17:14,The only thing we found at the scene were the sunglasses.
276,00:17:14,00:17:16,Where's the rest of it?
277,00:17:20,00:17:22,"STOKES: Okay, we're digging through trash."
278,00:17:22,00:17:25,"More specifically, anything from Dempsey's Department Store."
279,00:17:25,00:17:27,"Clothing tags, assorted candy items."
280,00:17:27,00:17:32,"Okay? Check the cans, the Dumpsters, sewage drains, Port-a-Potties."
281,00:17:32,00:17:34,"Okay, be thorough."
282,00:17:34,00:17:35,"Yeah, let's do it."
283,00:17:37,00:17:42,"Remember to check along the fences, under cars."
284,00:17:42,00:17:45,These are places where evidence can hide.
285,00:17:45,00:17:47,Use your imagination.
286,00:17:47,00:17:52,"STOKES: I know this seems like a simple trash hunt, but it could make or break the case."
287,00:17:52,00:17:57,"The sooner we find the stuff, the sooner we're going to find this kid, so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty."
288,00:17:57,00:17:59,Hodges.
289,00:18:01,00:18:05,"Come on, man. I know you're not nuts about the field, but I didn't bring you all the way out here to just stand around."
290,00:18:05,00:18:06,You know what I mean?
291,00:18:06,00:18:08,Can I see you for a second?
292,00:18:11,00:18:14,What?
293,00:18:14,00:18:18,You can work hard or you can work smart.
294,00:18:23,00:18:25,Can I go now?
295,00:18:34,00:18:35,(knocking on door)
296,00:18:35,00:18:37,LVPD! Open up!
297,00:18:37,00:18:38,(door bursts open)
298,00:18:38,00:18:41,(people chattering in Korean on TV)
299,00:18:45,00:18:47,(yelling in Korean)
300,00:18:47,00:18:48,"Sorry to barge in on you, ma'am."
301,00:18:48,00:18:50,We're just looking for a missing little boy.
302,00:18:50,00:18:52,ADAMS: Gun!
303,00:18:52,00:18:53,She's got a gun!
304,00:18:53,00:18:55,"Nick, she's got a gun."
305,00:18:55,00:18:56,What are you doing? Put that thing down.
306,00:18:56,00:18:58,(yelling in Korean)
307,00:18:58,00:19:00,"Lady, put that gun down right now."
308,00:19:00,00:19:02,Put the gun down or we'll shoot.
309,00:19:02,00:19:03,"No, we won't. Relax."
310,00:19:03,00:19:07,"Ma'am, we're looking for a little boy who's in really big trouble."
311,00:19:07,00:19:09,His name is Park Bang.
312,00:19:09,00:19:10,(yelling in Korean)
313,00:19:10,00:19:11,She doesn't understand.
314,00:19:11,00:19:13,Where the hell is the translator?!
315,00:19:13,00:19:15,She understands just fine. Don't you?
316,00:19:15,00:19:16,Park Bang.
317,00:19:16,00:19:19,We just want to help him. She doesn't understand.
318,00:19:19,00:19:22,(yelling in Korean)
319,00:19:22,00:19:23,Drop the gun! Nick!
320,00:19:23,00:19:25,(speaking Korean)
321,00:19:27,00:19:31,(boy speaking Korean)
322,00:19:32,00:19:36,(boy speaking Korean)
323,00:19:36,00:19:39,(speaking Korean)
324,00:20:04,00:20:06,Riley. What's the deal?
325,00:20:07,00:20:09,(sighs) Kid's pretty weak.
326,00:20:09,00:20:13,"I asked him if he remembered anything about the shootings, but he wouldn't even open his mouth."
327,00:20:13,00:20:15,Where is his CPS investigator?
328,00:20:15,00:20:16,En route.
329,00:20:16,00:20:20,You interviewed a minor without an advocate present?
330,00:20:20,00:20:23,Not officially.
331,00:20:23,00:20:25,Those regulations are there to protect the welfare of the child.
332,00:20:25,00:20:26,Don't ever do that again.
333,00:20:26,00:20:28,"Look, I didn't do anything wrong."
334,00:20:28,00:20:30,I was just trying to help our case.
335,00:20:30,00:20:32,Maybe you should go back to the lab.
336,00:20:32,00:20:34,Happy to.
337,00:20:38,00:20:41,"Okay, let's get that shirt off."
338,00:20:41,00:20:43,Sit up a little bit. Okay.
339,00:20:50,00:20:52,Good job.
340,00:20:57,00:20:59,"GRISSOM: Excuse me, Doctor."
341,00:20:59,00:21:02,I'm with the Las Vegas Police Department.
342,00:21:02,00:21:05,Why does this boy have a gastric tube?
343,00:21:05,00:21:08,Might be an issue with feeding.
344,00:21:08,00:21:09,"Trouble swallowing, that sort of thing."
345,00:21:09,00:21:12,We'll do a chest X-ray to be sure.
346,00:21:12,00:21:14,What about this skin condition?
347,00:21:14,00:21:18,"Yeah, probably a side effect of his HIV meds."
348,00:21:18,00:21:20,CPS sent his records over.
349,00:21:20,00:21:23,He's on a pretty severe regimen.
350,00:21:23,00:21:29,Why is there dried blood around the feeding tube? He could have caught it on something-- tried to pull it out.
351,00:21:29,00:21:34,"Hey, kiddo, I'm going to take good care of you, don't worry."
352,00:21:34,00:21:36,(raspy breathing)
353,00:21:39,00:21:41,(three gunshots)
354,00:21:42,00:21:43,(woman speaking Korean)
355,00:21:43,00:21:48,OFFICER KWAN: She says that she was just watering her garden when she heard gunshots and people started running.
356,00:21:48,00:21:53,"(crowd screaming, shrieking)"
357,00:21:53,00:21:55,(speaking Korean)
358,00:22:00,00:22:06,She took the boy in and fed him and let him play with some old toys.
359,00:22:06,00:22:11,(speaking Korean)
360,00:22:11,00:22:15,And then the boy went to sleep like little boys should.
361,00:22:15,00:22:19,(speaking Korean)
362,00:22:19,00:22:22,She says she was just trying to protect the boy.
363,00:22:22,00:22:24,Why'd you pull a gun on the police?
364,00:22:24,00:22:27,(translating in Korean)
365,00:22:27,00:22:34,(replies in Korean)
366,00:22:34,00:22:38,"She says that where she comes from, people would take care of their neighbors."
367,00:22:38,00:22:41,You should've turned him over to us right away.
368,00:22:41,00:22:44,(Kwan translating)
369,00:22:44,00:22:50,(replies in Korean)
370,00:22:50,00:22:52,She asks why?
371,00:22:52,00:22:55,So you can cut another hole in his stomach?
372,00:22:58,00:23:00,"BRASS: Okay, then, how about these guys?"
373,00:23:00,00:23:03,"Any of these guys look familiar, huh?"
374,00:23:03,00:23:05,"Come on, Park, you can talk to me."
375,00:23:05,00:23:06,(Chin speaking Korean)
376,00:23:06,00:23:08,These people are here to help you.
377,00:23:08,00:23:15,"If you see one that hurt your mommy or uncle, all you have to do is point, okay, pal?"
378,00:23:15,00:23:17,Huh?
379,00:23:20,00:23:21,Don't want to do it now?
380,00:23:21,00:23:23,"Okay, I'll tell you what, we'll do it another time."
381,00:23:23,00:23:25,"Take care, buddy."
382,00:23:28,00:23:31,I'm going to put some police officers at the door.
383,00:23:31,00:23:35,"I don't think the KD will try anything here, but you never know."
384,00:23:35,00:23:36,Are you finished?
385,00:23:36,00:23:38,I still got to collect biologicals.
386,00:23:38,00:23:40,I'll see you later.
387,00:23:48,00:23:49,"He understands English, right?"
388,00:23:49,00:23:51,Mm-hmm.
389,00:23:51,00:23:53,"Hi, Park. My name is Gil."
390,00:23:53,00:23:57,"I'm not a doctor, I'm not a policeman."
391,00:23:57,00:23:59,I'm kind of a...
392,00:23:59,00:24:02,What am I? I don't know.
393,00:24:02,00:24:04,I mostly do a lot of thinking.
394,00:24:04,00:24:08,But I do need to look under your fingernails.
395,00:24:13,00:24:15,I'm not going to grab your hand.
396,00:24:16,00:24:19,"I'll just wait here until you want to give it to me, okay?"
397,00:24:19,00:24:22,But I promise you it won't hurt.
398,00:24:33,00:24:34,Thank you.
399,00:24:47,00:24:48,"Hello, Mrs. Chin."
400,00:24:48,00:24:50,I got here as fast as I could.
401,00:24:50,00:24:52,"Dr. Eisling, this is Mr. Grissom from the crime lab."
402,00:24:52,00:24:54,How do you do?
403,00:24:54,00:24:55,"Hey, Park."
404,00:24:56,00:24:59,"We're, uh... we're going to have to give him his medication here."
405,00:24:59,00:25:01,(whines in protest)
406,00:25:01,00:25:02,He doesn't seem to want it.
407,00:25:02,00:25:05,"Well, that's why we gave him a gastric tube."
408,00:25:05,00:25:06,"Okay, now come on..."
409,00:25:06,00:25:08,"No! (yelling in Korean) Okay, come on..."
410,00:25:08,00:25:10,"Can you hold him, please?"
411,00:25:10,00:25:14,"I know, I know... Okay, I know, I know. (yelling in Korean)"
412,00:25:14,00:25:16,Come hold him. Come hold him.
413,00:25:16,00:25:18,Just take his arm.
414,00:25:18,00:25:21,I know. I know.
415,00:25:21,00:25:23,(screaming)
416,00:25:23,00:25:24,"Stay still, Stay still."
417,00:25:25,00:25:27,(Park screaming)
418,00:25:27,00:25:29,EISLING: Okay. All right.
419,00:25:31,00:25:35,So Park was wearing the white T-shirt during the shooting.
420,00:25:35,00:25:37,He changed into the blue one at the old woman's house.
421,00:25:37,00:25:39,Threw the white one away.
422,00:25:39,00:25:42,Makes sense. Had his mother and his uncle's blood all over him.
423,00:25:42,00:25:45,"(two gunshots, blood splattering)"
424,00:25:47,00:25:49,Park Bang's tox report.
425,00:25:49,00:25:52,Most adult cancer patients don't have this many drugs in their systems.
426,00:25:52,00:25:54,But an eight-year-old...?
427,00:25:54,00:25:55,Never seen anything like it.
428,00:25:55,00:26:02,"Most of the drugs on that list are meant to stop cell development, stop bone marrow from producing blood, stop proteins from assembling."
429,00:26:02,00:26:09,"If he continues on this regimen, by the time he's 15, he won't even have the physical development of a ten-year-old."
430,00:26:09,00:26:10,Does he actually have AIDS?
431,00:26:11,00:26:12,"No, not yet."
432,00:26:12,00:26:13,He's HIV-positive.
433,00:26:13,00:26:16,"If you ask me, he's being badly overmedicated."
434,00:26:16,00:26:18,Zendrek has an FDA black box label.
435,00:26:18,00:26:20,That's the strongest warning there is.
436,00:26:20,00:26:22,Life-threatening side effects.
437,00:26:22,00:26:23,Some of the other drugs aren't even on the market.
438,00:26:23,00:26:26,They're only being used in clinical trials.
439,00:26:26,00:26:27,Maybe he's in one.
440,00:26:27,00:26:32,GRISSOM: How does a little kid with a junkie mother and gangster father get on a clinical trial?
441,00:27:19,00:27:21,"ADAMS: Well, so much for the upstanding businessman."
442,00:27:21,00:27:28,This guy's real name is Jin Ming and his mug shot was taken when he was 18 years old when he was caught stealing cars with a street racing gang.
443,00:27:28,00:27:31,Now he's 30 and he hasn't been busted since.
444,00:27:31,00:27:34,And Park had this guy's skin under his fingernails? Yeah.
445,00:27:34,00:27:35,So they must been fighting?
446,00:27:35,00:27:36,Possibly.
447,00:27:36,00:27:42,"The thing is, that skin that was under Park's nails-- it was gluteus maximus."
448,00:27:42,00:27:48,"It's very similar to the epidermal tissue on the rest of the body, but it's got far fewer hair follicles."
449,00:27:48,00:27:52,"So, in addition to everything else, this kid's been molested?"
450,00:27:52,00:27:54,"Well, maybe not."
451,00:27:54,00:27:57,Here.
452,00:27:57,00:27:59,Take a look at Jin's neck.
453,00:27:59,00:28:01,No tattoos.
454,00:28:01,00:28:03,He had a major makeover.
455,00:28:03,00:28:04,Yeah.
456,00:28:04,00:28:09,I went out a couple times with a casino executive who had some really unusual scars.
457,00:28:09,00:28:14,"And, long story short, he told me that he was very embarrassed by some old tattoos that he had."
458,00:28:14,00:28:17,So he had them covered with replicated skin.
459,00:28:17,00:28:18,From his butt?
460,00:28:18,00:28:20,I didn't ask.
461,00:28:20,00:28:26,"But, you know, if you're a street racer, then it might be kind of cool to flash a lot of ink."
462,00:28:27,00:28:29,But if you're a Kkangpae Dragon...
463,00:28:29,00:28:31,It pays to be invisible.
464,00:28:31,00:28:33,"(banging, wood cracking)"
465,00:28:35,00:28:37,I got left.
466,00:28:59,00:29:02,This basement's the only room with anything in it.
467,00:29:02,00:29:05,"The uni's were looking for the kid, first time through."
468,00:29:05,00:29:07,It's probably why they missed it.
469,00:29:07,00:29:10,This must be where Park and his mother lived.
470,00:29:11,00:29:16,Why would this guy Jin kill somebody he let live in his house?
471,00:29:16,00:29:18,He's in a gang. She's a druggie.
472,00:29:18,00:29:21,The possibilities are endless.
473,00:29:21,00:29:23,CAVALIERE: Yeah.
474,00:29:44,00:29:46,Look at this.
475,00:29:48,00:29:50,Scumbag's in the picture with them.
476,00:29:50,00:29:51,(ticking)
477,00:29:51,00:29:53,(beeping) Down!
478,00:29:53,00:29:54,(explosion)
479,00:29:54,00:29:56,"(glass shattering, debris clattering)"
480,00:29:58,00:29:59,Officer down!
481,00:30:00,00:30:02,Clear the house and call the paramedics!
482,00:30:05,00:30:07,SANDERS: Detective Cavaliere's going to be all right.
483,00:30:07,00:30:09,Minor injuries.
484,00:30:09,00:30:11,Bomb squad said the explosive was a trip wire booby trap.
485,00:30:11,00:30:16,"Yeah, if Jin and the K D. really wanted to hurt somebody, they would've sent a more powerful message."
486,00:30:16,00:30:20,"So, I found an ambulance chaser's card on Kora Sil's desk."
487,00:30:20,00:30:22,I just got off the phone with him.
488,00:30:22,00:30:25,He claims that Kora was suing Park's doctor.
489,00:30:25,00:30:26,For what? Money.
490,00:30:26,00:30:30,"According to the lawyer, the doctor paid Kora to put Park on the clinical trial."
491,00:30:31,00:30:32,She wanted more.
492,00:30:32,00:30:33,How much was she getting?
493,00:30:33,00:30:35,25 a week.
494,00:30:35,00:30:37,She wanted 50.
495,00:31:28,00:31:30,"Hello, Doctor. What are you doing here?"
496,00:31:31,00:31:32,I'm here to give Park his medication.
497,00:31:32,00:31:35,"Oh, yeah. He needs to get it every day, doesn't he?"
498,00:31:35,00:31:36,Yes.
499,00:31:36,00:31:37,Or else the data's useless.
500,00:31:37,00:31:39,I suppose so.
501,00:31:39,00:31:43,"GRISSOM: Well, then what good would it do to continue to dose him after he went missing for two days?"
502,00:31:43,00:31:46,These drugs are saving his life.
503,00:31:46,00:31:47,"No, they're not."
504,00:31:47,00:31:50,I don't need to be a medical doctor to see that.
505,00:31:50,00:31:52,"No, what you're seeing are side effects."
506,00:31:52,00:31:54,And there are side effects to every drug.
507,00:31:54,00:31:58,"Look, this is a legitimate clinical trial, Mr. Grissom, approved by a formal committee..."
508,00:31:59,00:32:04,Consisting of doctors who are shareholders in the pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.
509,00:32:04,00:32:06,"Without these trials, these kids get nothing."
510,00:32:06,00:32:08,And what do you get?
511,00:32:08,00:32:09,Kickbacks?
512,00:32:09,00:32:11,Your medical opinion is irrelevant.
513,00:32:11,00:32:14,What I'm doing is perfectly legal.
514,00:32:14,00:32:15,"So, we're done here. Excuse me."
515,00:32:16,00:32:20,"You touch that kid, and I will charge you with reckless endangerment."
516,00:32:21,00:32:24,Child Services will back him up on that.
517,00:32:24,00:32:26,So I think you're done here.
518,00:32:28,00:32:31,We'll see about that.
519,00:32:41,00:32:43,(button clicks)
520,00:32:44,00:32:46,Park...
521,00:32:46,00:32:50,I need to ask you a few questions.
522,00:32:50,00:32:54,"You don't have to answer them, if you don't want to, okay?"
523,00:33:01,00:33:04,Do you know this man?
524,00:33:06,00:33:10,That's Jin.
525,00:33:10,00:33:13,Did you and your mother live at his house?
526,00:33:18,00:33:20,Is that where Uncle Sung found you?
527,00:33:22,00:33:23,Yeah.
528,00:33:25,00:33:26,(Park squeals happily)
529,00:33:26,00:33:29,(speaking Korean)
530,00:33:29,00:33:30,(groans)
531,00:33:30,00:33:33,(speaking Korean)
532,00:33:36,00:33:38,(sighs)
533,00:33:40,00:33:42,(speaking Korean)
534,00:33:42,00:33:43,(breathes weakly)
535,00:33:45,00:33:48,Uncle Sung didn't like my tube.
536,00:33:48,00:33:49,(shouting in Korean)
537,00:33:49,00:33:52,PARK: He fought with Mama.
538,00:33:52,00:33:54,(screams)
539,00:33:57,00:33:59,Then Jin came down.
540,00:33:59,00:34:01,"(Park crying, Jin shouting)"
541,00:34:06,00:34:10,Uncle Sung saved me.
542,00:34:10,00:34:12,What happened after that?
543,00:34:16,00:34:21,I'm not gonna let Jin or Dr. Eisling hurt you.
544,00:34:21,00:34:27,But that's why I need to know what happened.
545,00:34:27,00:34:29,Jin and Mama found us.
546,00:34:49,00:34:51,(gunshot)
547,00:34:59,00:35:00,(shouting in Korean)
548,00:35:01,00:35:02,(two gunshots)
549,00:35:02,00:35:04,(shell casing clinks on ground)
550,00:35:04,00:35:06,Why would he want to hurt your mother?
551,00:35:06,00:35:10,I guess he was just sick of having us around.
552,00:35:10,00:35:12,(coughs)
553,00:35:12,00:35:14,(coughing)
554,00:35:16,00:35:18,I finally got a statement from the kid.
555,00:35:18,00:35:22,He says that Jin shot both his mother and his Uncle with two different guns.
556,00:35:23,00:35:24,"BRASS: Well, that's great."
557,00:35:24,00:35:26,"Uh, that should be enough to charge Jin when we find him."
558,00:35:26,00:35:29,I-I just got faxed Sun Bang's prison record.
559,00:35:30,00:35:33,And there's something weird on his personal release form.
560,00:35:33,00:35:36,Listen to this: the guy left prison with a nine millimeter.
561,00:35:36,00:35:38,They let him out of jail with a gun?
562,00:35:38,00:35:39,"Well, it's only a misdemeanor, you know."
563,00:35:39,00:35:41,It's like a hotel; you get back what you checked in.
564,00:35:41,00:35:43,So you can go out and commit a felony.
565,00:35:43,00:35:44,Apparently.
566,00:35:44,00:35:47,"Now, is there any chance that Sung fired back?"
567,00:35:47,00:35:49,"No, we would have found extra bullets or shells at the scene."
568,00:35:49,00:35:52,"Well, maybe there's a bullet lodged in Jin's body."
569,00:35:52,00:35:54,No sign of a third bleeder.
570,00:35:54,00:35:57,"And if I understand the kid, Sung never got a chance to shoot back."
571,00:35:57,00:35:59,"Okay, thanks. I'll work on this."
572,00:36:12,00:36:13,Yep.
573,00:36:13,00:36:15,He carried his gun in his waistband.
574,00:36:15,00:36:18,Still doesn't mean he used it.
575,00:36:18,00:36:20,And doesn't really change Park's story.
576,00:36:22,00:36:24,How do we know Kora wasn't packing?
577,00:36:26,00:36:28,The father of her son was a gangster.
578,00:36:28,00:36:29,She was living with a gangster.
579,00:36:29,00:36:30,I wouldn't put it past her.
580,00:36:31,00:36:33,"Well, let's see."
581,00:36:35,00:36:40,Most women's clothes don't have a place to hide a gun.
582,00:36:40,00:36:41,"That's, uh..."
583,00:36:43,00:36:44,That's what purses are for.
584,00:36:51,00:36:54,Maybe Kora didn't need Jin to get her son back.
585,00:36:54,00:36:56,Maybe she took care of it herself.
586,00:36:56,00:36:57,(panting)
587,00:37:10,00:37:13,(shouting in Korean)
588,00:37:13,00:37:15,"(gunshot, people screaming)"
589,00:37:15,00:37:16,(grunts)
590,00:37:29,00:37:30,(grunts)
591,00:37:30,00:37:31,(gunshot)
592,00:37:33,00:37:35,You think they shot each other.
593,00:37:35,00:37:36,Why not?
594,00:37:36,00:37:39,"There's motive, the evidence suggests it."
595,00:37:39,00:37:42,Where are their guns?
596,00:37:42,00:37:44,Dead man with a gun in the hood.
597,00:37:44,00:37:45,Gone in 60 seconds.
598,00:37:46,00:37:51,Jin skips town because this family dispute uncovers his once invisible gang.
599,00:37:51,00:37:54,He leaves the booby trap because he's angry about it.
600,00:37:54,00:37:56,It's possible.
601,00:37:56,00:37:59,It's also possible that Jin shot both vics.
602,00:37:59,00:38:00,Which is what the kid said.
603,00:38:00,00:38:02,And he was the closest witness.
604,00:38:02,00:38:07,"If your uncle and your mother shot each other, you would probably blame the gangbanger, too."
605,00:38:10,00:38:12,"Okay, pilgrim..."
606,00:38:12,00:38:14,we'll settle this on the street.
607,00:38:17,00:38:19,"If you need any water or anything, you just let me know."
608,00:38:19,00:38:21,Okay.
609,00:38:21,00:38:29,"Okay, Park, I know you already told me what-what happened, but now I need you to show me what happened, okay?"
610,00:38:29,00:38:35,"Now, we're gonna pretend that this is your mother, this is your uncle, and that's Jin."
611,00:38:35,00:38:40,Would you show me where your uncle was standing when the shooting began?
612,00:38:48,00:38:51,Where was your mother standing when the shooting began?
613,00:39:01,00:39:03,Would you show me where Jin was standing?
614,00:39:09,00:39:11,And where were you standing?
615,00:39:17,00:39:19,Did your uncle have a gun?
616,00:39:20,00:39:23,Did your mother have a gun?
617,00:39:25,00:39:29,Did your mother fall down before Jin shot her?
618,00:39:31,00:39:34,Did Jin fall down before he shot your mother?
619,00:39:37,00:39:38,He's lying.
620,00:39:38,00:39:43,"Well, the ferrotrace doesn't confirm that either of them had guns at the time of the shooting."
621,00:39:43,00:39:45,But the trajectory...
622,00:39:45,00:39:46,Neither Kora nor Jin fell.
623,00:39:46,00:39:50,How do you explain Kora's 20-degree entry?
624,00:39:54,00:40:00,"Park, could you show me how Jin shot your mother?"
625,00:40:14,00:40:16,"It was like this: Bang, bang!"
626,00:40:21,00:40:22,"Park, would you do that again?"
627,00:40:22,00:40:24,"But this time, keep your arm out."
628,00:40:24,00:40:26,"Bang, bang!"
629,00:40:45,00:40:47,(shouting in Korean)
630,00:40:49,00:40:51,(shouting)
631,00:40:52,00:40:54,(grunts)
632,00:41:06,00:41:08,(speaking Korean)
633,00:41:24,00:41:26,"(gunshot, blood splattering)"
634,00:41:26,00:41:27,(another gunshot)
635,00:41:27,00:41:29,(shell casing clinks on ground)
636,00:41:29,00:41:30,(crowd screaming)
637,00:41:32,00:41:35,The kid shot his mother for shooting his uncle.
638,00:41:35,00:41:38,So you think Jin had nothing to do with it?
639,00:41:38,00:41:40,Not the shooting.
640,00:41:40,00:41:41,"Well, it makes sense."
641,00:41:41,00:41:44,"I mean, his uncle was trying to protect him, and his mother was torturing him."
642,00:41:46,00:41:51,GRISSOM: Park never controlled anything in his life till he fired that gun.
643,00:42:04,00:42:07,BRASS: An HIV-positive eight-year-old.
644,00:42:07,00:42:10,No wonder no one wanted to talk.
645,00:42:10,00:42:13,Juvi may be the best thing for him.
646,00:42:14,00:42:16,He'll get the care he needs there.
647,00:42:16,00:42:18,Yeah.
648,00:42:20,00:42:22,I'm sorry we solved this.
649,00:42:27,00:42:28,I really am.
