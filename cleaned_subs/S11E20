0	00:00:09	00:00:11	You see an address?
1	00:00:11	00:00:12	Man, I don't even see any houses.
2	00:00:12	00:00:16	I didn't know they had this much farmland outside of Vegas.
3	00:00:16	00:00:17	Welcome to Nessus.
4	00:00:17	00:00:23	Half a dozen slot machines, one blackjack table and manure-- lots and lots of manure.
5	00:00:23	00:00:27	I can't see it, but I can sure smell it.
6	00:00:27	00:00:30	Nick, I'm telling you, we passed the crime scene.
7	00:00:30	00:00:31	No, no, just keep going.
8	00:00:31	00:00:33	I've had plenty of 419s out here.
9	00:00:33	00:00:37	What's up with this GPS? Whoa!
10	00:00:37	00:00:39	Holy cow!
11	00:00:41	00:00:45	You know, you kill one of those in India, you spend six months in jail.
12	00:00:45	00:00:47	Moo!
13	00:00:49	00:00:52	Control, this is Langston.
14	00:00:54	00:00:55	We're lost.
15	00:01:13	00:01:15	What took you guys so long?
16	00:01:15	00:01:16	You hit a cow or something?
17	00:01:16	00:01:19	Better not. They're 1,600 bucks apiece.
18	00:01:19	00:01:20	And they don't milk when they're riled.
19	00:01:22	00:01:25	(sighs) Where's the body?
20	00:01:25	00:01:27	I'll show you.
21	00:01:29	00:01:31	Watch your step there.
22	00:01:34	00:01:36	Farmer went camping at the Virgin River.
23	00:01:36	00:01:39	Came back tonight to feed the cows, and saw this.
24	00:01:39	00:01:42	Ah, manure with hint of decomp.
25	00:01:43	00:01:47	Well, it's definitely got legs, but no hands.
26	00:01:57	00:02:00	First generation, third instar larvae.
27	00:02:00	00:02:03	Been dead 96-plus hours.
28	00:02:03	00:02:06	White female adult.
29	00:02:06	00:02:09	That's not all we have.
30	00:02:09	00:02:13	Killers sometimes remove the head and hands to avoid identification.
31	00:02:13	00:02:15	Don't usually dump 'em with the body.
32	00:02:15	00:02:17	I don't think this is her hand.
33	00:02:17	00:02:18	It's too thick.
34	00:02:18	00:02:22	The ridges are wide. Tells me it was a male.
35	00:02:23	00:02:24	Yeah, so's this.
36	00:02:27	00:02:30	She-body, he-hands.
37	00:02:30	00:02:34	We're gonna have to go through this whole haystack, see if we can find the rest of them.
38	00:02:34	00:02:35	It's easier than looking for needles.
39	00:02:38	00:02:40	Langston.
40	00:02:41	00:02:43	What?!
41	00:02:43	00:02:44	Yeah, be right there.
42	00:02:44	00:02:46	Sorry, Nick, gotta go.
43	00:02:46	00:02:48	Hey, where you going?!
44	00:02:48	00:02:49	We're gonna have to search this whole farm!
45	00:02:49	00:02:51	Think you just lost your ride.
46	00:02:53	00:02:54	I'll handle it.
47	00:02:56	00:03:01	I know you're starting to question your commitment to your job, Ray.
48	00:03:01	00:03:04	And I don't think I'm the only one.
49	00:03:04	00:03:05	Your friend Haskell surfaced.
50	00:03:05	00:03:07	I thought I left you enough bread crumbs to follow.
51	00:03:07	00:03:10	Did I need to make a video, Ray?
52	00:03:10	00:03:15	I'm getting tired of doing all the work in the relationship.
53	00:03:15	00:03:20	And, you know, when I feel unwanted, bad things happen.
54	00:03:20	00:03:23	Maybe you're just afraid to catch me.
55	00:03:23	00:03:25	Maybe you don't like looking in the mirror, Ray.
56	00:03:25	00:03:29	Maybe you don't like what you see.
57	00:04:04	00:04:07	Maybe you don't like looking in the mirror, Ray.
58	00:04:07	00:04:09	Where did you get this?
59	00:04:09	00:04:10	Vivian Tinsdale's parents.
60	00:04:10	00:04:12	Vivian Tinsdale.
61	00:04:12	00:04:13	One of Haskell's brides.
62	00:04:13	00:04:16	Yeah. Yeah. You walked in at the end of the movie.
63	00:04:16	00:04:18	You need to see the opening.
64	00:04:18	00:04:23	Please, Daddy, I'm sorry, but you're the only one who can save me.
65	00:04:23	00:04:25	Daddy, he's done things to me!
66	00:04:25	00:04:29	And the things he says he's gonna do...!
67	00:04:31	00:04:36	Please, Daddy, whatever he wants, just pay him!
68	00:04:36	00:04:37	When did they get this?
69	00:04:37	00:04:38	Four days ago.
70	00:04:38	00:04:41	She's probably already dead.
71	00:04:43	00:04:49	Mr. Tinsdale, it took you four days to come forward with this video?
72	00:04:49	00:04:50	Who are you? Ray Langston.
73	00:04:50	00:04:53	I've been investigating Nate Haskell for two years.
74	00:04:53	00:04:54	Why didn't you come forward sooner?
75	00:04:54	00:04:57	Well, my computer marked Vivian's e-mails as spam.
76	00:04:57	00:04:59	I didn't see them until last night.
77	00:04:59	00:05:00	That's still 24 hours ago.
78	00:05:00	00:05:03	Officer, we haven't spoken to Vivian in years.
79	00:05:03	00:05:05	She's a stranger to us.
80	00:05:05	00:05:07	Now she's asking for our help.
81	00:05:07	00:05:09	So you're saying you don't care?
82	00:05:09	00:05:11	Listen, my daughter is mentally ill.
83	00:05:11	00:05:13	She's a sociopath and a pathological liar.
84	00:05:13	00:05:18	How do you explain the bruises on her face? Well, I assume they're self-inflicted. So you're saying the video's a scam?
85	00:05:18	00:05:24	I'm saying that the only time we ever hear from our daughter is when she's asking for money.
86	00:05:24	00:05:25	She's not getting another dime.
87	00:05:25	00:05:28	You have the video. My husband and I are going to go.
88	00:05:28	00:05:32	Look, that video and your daughter are our only link we have to an escaped serial killer.
89	00:05:32	00:05:35	If you're right and Vivian is only interested in money, you'll get a call from Haskell.
90	00:05:35	00:05:37	When that call comes, we need to be there.
91	00:05:39	00:05:41	we don't want Nate Haskell to kill your daughter.
92	00:05:41	00:05:43	Or anyone else.
93	00:05:43	00:05:46	Now please help us.
94	00:05:58	00:06:00	Hey, Nick. Hey.
95	00:06:00	00:06:02	Please, don't ask me if I need a hand.
96	00:06:02	00:06:05	Actually, I was gonna tell you you smell like a Porta Potti.
97	00:06:05	00:06:07	Thank you, sir.
98	00:06:07	00:06:09	Obvious sharp-force trauma.
99	00:06:09	00:06:12	Crushed and cut carpals.
100	00:06:12	00:06:18	Skin on the anterior aspect of the wrist looks like it's been pulled and snapped from the forearm.
101	00:06:18	00:06:21	My guess is the killer got a little happy with a hand ax.
102	00:06:22	00:06:28	So you think this guy was alive when his hands waved good-bye to the rest of his body?
103	00:06:28	00:06:30	Well, no contusions around the cut.
104	00:06:30	00:06:33	Postmortem hack job.
105	00:06:33	00:06:34	Go ahead and print.
106	00:06:34	00:06:37	No, these fingers are too dehydrated.
107	00:06:37	00:06:39	I'm gonna have to PVS them.
108	00:06:39	00:06:45	If you compare his hand to her wrist, there are similar crushing and cutting injuries to the radius and ulna.
109	00:06:45	00:06:47	Same tool, same killer.
110	00:06:47	00:06:50	Video camera's clock and GPS were turned off.
111	00:06:50	00:06:52	No metadata.
112	00:06:52	00:06:54	No way to tell when or where it was shot.
113	00:06:54	00:06:56	Mm, the video was e-mailed to the Tinsdales.
114	00:06:56	00:06:57	You should be able to trace that.
115	00:06:57	00:06:59	Working on it.
116	00:06:59	00:07:04	Haskell bounced it around the Web a half-dozen times.
117	00:07:06	00:07:10	Well! Deputy Chief Curtis.
118	00:07:10	00:07:11	The shield looks good on you.
119	00:07:11	00:07:12	Congrats on the promotion.
120	00:07:12	00:07:14	Thanks, Archie.
121	00:07:14	00:07:16	You must be Ray Langston.
122	00:07:16	00:07:18	Sofia Curtis.
123	00:07:18	00:07:19	Nice to meet you.
124	00:07:19	00:07:24	Just got the nod from the sheriff to head up the Haskell task force.
125	00:07:24	00:07:26	FYI, I'm calling in the feds.
126	00:07:26	00:07:28	That might not be the best move.
127	00:07:28	00:07:30	We've had sightings of Haskell from Bangor to San Diego.
128	00:07:30	00:07:33	We got reason to believe he's crossed state lines.
129	00:07:33	00:07:35	That makes it federal.
130	00:07:35	00:07:36	What about the video?
131	00:07:36	00:07:38	The Tinsdales live here in Vegas.
132	00:07:38	00:07:41	Why demand a ransom and then not stick around to collect it?
133	00:07:41	00:07:44	Haskell made no specific demand for money.
134	00:07:44	00:07:47	So, even if it's not about money, it's about the Tinsdales.
135	00:07:47	00:07:48	That connects him to Vegas.
136	00:07:48	00:07:51	We both know how this works.
137	00:07:51	00:07:53	The lab will still process the evidence.
138	00:07:53	00:07:54	You're not relinquishing control.
139	00:07:54	00:07:57	This video is the first solid lead we've had in months.
140	00:07:57	00:08:01	Unless you got proof that Haskell's still in state, I'm making the call.
141	00:08:01	00:08:03	Got it.
142	00:08:03	00:08:05	Haskell must be getting some I.T. support.
143	00:08:05	00:08:11	He uploaded the video from a open Wi-Fi hot spot near the Vegas Motor Speedway.
144	00:08:11	00:08:13	I know him. I knew I was right.
145	00:08:13	00:08:15	You got lucky today.
146	00:08:15	00:08:18	Police officers at the Tinsdale house just intercepted a call from Haskell.
147	00:08:18	00:08:21	I got him on the line now. Run a trace.
148	00:08:21	00:08:22	Yes, sir, running it now.
149	00:08:22	00:08:25	Avery, pencils ready?
150	00:08:25	00:08:26	Just give me a second.
151	00:08:26	00:08:29	Now, you really should be better prepared for this kind of thing, Avery.
152	00:08:29	00:08:33	I hope you're not stalling so my good friend Ray Langston can trace this.
153	00:08:33	00:08:34	Maybe I should hang up right now.
154	00:08:34	00:08:36	No, don't. I'm here.
155	00:08:36	00:08:42	Provenzi Park, 5 No cops. You hear that, Ray?
156	00:08:44	00:08:46	No user information.
157	00:08:46	00:08:47	Disposable phone.
158	00:08:47	00:08:48	He's probably disposed of it already.
159	00:08:48	00:08:51	Shout-out from Haskell.
160	00:08:51	00:08:52	The man does like sticking it to you.
161	00:08:52	00:08:55	30. That gives us two hours.
162	00:08:55	00:08:58	Hey.
163	00:08:58	00:09:00	Well, thank you for showering.
164	00:09:00	00:09:04	Well, I didn't necessarily do it for you, but you're welcome.
165	00:09:04	00:09:05	Got a C.O.D. yet?
166	00:09:05	00:09:07	No. I don't even have a head.
167	00:09:07	00:09:10	Torso's fairly fit, rules out most natural causes.
168	00:09:10	00:09:13	Can anything else help us get an I.D. on her?
169	00:09:13	00:09:14	Appendectomy scar.
170	00:09:14	00:09:22	Cervix shows no prior pregnancies, no tattoos, no implants, but small scar on the abdomen could be from liposuction.
171	00:09:22	00:09:25	Left femur has an old radial fracture.
172	00:09:25	00:09:27	Slight calcification.
173	00:09:27	00:09:29	early to mid-30s.
174	00:09:29	00:09:33	Woman in her 30's, appendectomy, lipo and a busted leg.
175	00:09:33	00:09:34	All you need now is a name.
176	00:09:35	00:09:37	I just got a hit off one of the hands.
177	00:09:37	00:09:40	Came back to a Graham Kole.
178	00:09:40	00:09:43	Greg DMV'd him, got an address. It's a doctor's office.
179	00:09:56	00:10:00	Plastic surgeon with his hands cut off, huh?
180	00:10:00	00:10:03	Maybe he messed up some psycho hooker's boob job.
181	00:10:03	00:10:07	Yeah, what kind of a surgeon works out of a strip mall next to a taco joint?
182	00:10:12	00:10:14	Well, we got a warrant.
183	00:10:14	00:10:16	We do, don't we? Mm-hmm.
184	00:10:28	00:10:31	There's the head, neck, arms and rest of Dr. Kole.
185	00:10:42	00:10:46	Two blood pools...
186	00:10:46	00:10:48	two victims.
187	00:10:48	00:10:50	Good chance this is our primary.
188	00:11:00	00:11:02	Mr. Tinsdale.
189	00:11:02	00:11:05	Mr. Tinsdale, if you can hear me, please cough.
190	00:11:06	00:11:07	Okay, we're good.
191	00:11:29	00:11:31	I don't think it's his cell phone.
192	00:11:31	00:11:33	Tell him to answer it.
193	00:11:33	00:11:36	Mr. Tinsdale, please find that phone and answer it.
194	00:11:36	00:11:41	Hold it up to your right ear so I can record the caller's voice in your earpiece.
195	00:11:41	00:11:42	Hello?
196	00:11:42	00:11:44	The other ear. The right ear. Tell him the right ear.
197	00:11:44	00:11:46	What's he doing?
198	00:11:46	00:11:47	Mr. Tinsdale, switch sides, please.
199	00:11:47	00:11:48	Your other ear.
200	00:11:48	00:11:50	Wait a minute. You're breaking up.
201	00:11:51	00:11:53	Yeah, there, I can hear you.
202	00:11:53	00:11:55	Too bad we can't.
203	00:11:55	00:11:57	That wasn't the deal.
204	00:11:57	00:11:59	I did what you asked.
205	00:11:59	00:12:02	Where's Vivian? I want to talk to her right now.
206	00:12:05	00:12:08	Yes, I see it.
207	00:12:08	00:12:10	It's the pink one?
208	00:12:20	00:12:23	Yes, I have it.
209	00:12:23	00:12:26	All right, I understand.
210	00:12:31	00:12:32	Well, happy big birthday, baby.
211	00:12:32	00:12:34	He better hope that's not a bomb.
212	00:12:34	00:12:37	He's being directed.
213	00:12:37	00:12:39	Scan the park.
214	00:12:39	00:12:42	Turn to the woman by the playground.
215	00:12:42	00:12:44	I thinks she's got eyes on Tinsdale.
216	00:12:44	00:12:47	Archie, give me a better look.
217	00:12:47	00:12:48	Damn! That's Tina Vincent!
218	00:12:48	00:12:50	It's a bride!
219	00:12:54	00:12:56	She spotted us.
220	00:12:56	00:12:58	Suspect now on foot, running southbound.
221	00:12:58	00:13:02	LVPD! Down on the ground! Now!
222	00:13:02	00:13:03	Whoa! She's gone!
223	00:13:04	00:13:06	Out of the way! (shrieking)
224	00:13:06	00:13:08	Where is he?! (chuckles)
225	00:13:08	00:13:11	Where's Nate?
226	00:13:12	00:13:13	Where is he?!
227	00:13:13	00:13:15	Ray! Hey, Ray!
228	00:13:15	00:13:16	Where is he?!
229	00:13:29	00:13:32	What were you doing in the park, Tina?
230	00:13:32	00:13:35	What do people do in parks?
231	00:13:35	00:13:37	Walk dogs.
232	00:13:37	00:13:39	Walk themselves.
233	00:13:39	00:13:42	I find it very...
234	00:13:42	00:13:43	soothing.
235	00:13:43	00:13:46	I find it very coincidental given your relationship with Nate Haskell.
236	00:13:46	00:13:48	Relationship? No.
237	00:13:48	00:13:50	I admire him.
238	00:13:50	00:13:59	I admire his courage because he's clearly a victim of the justice system that is bent on persecuting him for crimes he could not commit.
239	00:13:59	00:14:04	You were present at his recent trial along with Vivian Tinsdale-- what's your relationship with her?
240	00:14:04	00:14:06	She disgusts me.
241	00:14:06	00:14:09	And I think she's a bad influence on Nate.
242	00:14:09	00:14:11	It sounds like you've seen Vivian and Nate recently.
243	00:14:11	00:14:13	My client didn't say that.
244	00:14:13	00:14:14	Don't put words in her mouth.
245	00:14:14	00:14:16	I couldn't if I tried.
246	00:14:16	00:14:17	Where is Nate Haskell now?
247	00:14:17	00:14:21	Where's Vivian? Are you aware that she's been kidnapped? My client's told you what she knows.
248	00:14:21	00:14:26	Last I checked, a walk in the park is not a crime.
249	00:14:26	00:14:28	But a cop beating up on an innocent civilian is.
250	00:14:28	00:14:30	I'll be in touch.
251	00:14:37	00:14:41	Oh, your prisons couldn't hold Nate.
252	00:14:41	00:14:44	He willed himself to be free.
253	00:14:44	00:14:47	Tell Ray Langston he'll never catch him...
254	00:14:47	00:14:50	not until Nate wills it.
255	00:15:11	00:15:15	Where is Hodges?
256	00:15:15	00:15:17	Uh, he's moving out of his mother's place... finally.
257	00:15:17	00:15:19	I'm not sure who's more traumatized.
258	00:15:19	00:15:22	Is, uh, is that the package from the park?
259	00:15:22	00:15:23	I heard Haskell.
260	00:15:23	00:15:25	left you a present. It's evidence.
261	00:15:25	00:15:27	I assume it's been X-rayed?
262	00:15:27	00:15:28	Yes, the Bomb Squad scanned it.
263	00:15:28	00:15:31	I just checked it for trace.
264	00:15:31	00:15:33	I need to print it.
265	00:15:33	00:15:34	Where's Mandy?
266	00:15:34	00:15:36	Uh, Denver. Conference.
267	00:15:36	00:15:39	You're in luck. I've worked in every forensic discipline except QD.
268	00:15:39	00:15:41	Too many paper cuts.
269	00:15:41	00:15:42	Let me help you.
270	00:15:42	00:15:45	You do the box, I'll do the tape.
271	00:16:16	00:16:20	Ray, the size says probably male.
272	00:16:20	00:16:22	He left it dead center.
273	00:16:22	00:16:24	Exquisite ridge detail.
274	00:16:24	00:16:25	Sloppy, sloppy.
275	00:16:25	00:16:27	Not sloppy. Intentional.
276	00:16:27	00:16:29	It's Haskell's way of signing the package.
277	00:16:29	00:16:30	Run it anyway.
278	00:16:46	00:16:48	Do you recognize this man?
279	00:16:48	00:16:50	Yeah, I sure as hell do.
280	00:16:50	00:16:51	Where'd you get that?
281	00:16:51	00:16:52	Who is he?
282	00:16:52	00:16:54	That's Jack.
283	00:16:54	00:16:55	That's Jack York.
284	00:16:55	00:16:56	It was Vivian's first husband.
285	00:16:56	00:16:58	This was in the box you gave me.
286	00:16:58	00:17:01	You have any idea why Nate Haskell wanted you to give me this photograph?
287	00:17:01	00:17:02	No, I don't.
288	00:17:02	00:17:04	Tell us about Jack York.
289	00:17:04	00:17:09	Well, he was just one in a long line of men that took advantage of Vivian.
290	00:17:09	00:17:11	Except this one she married.
291	00:17:11	00:17:13	Only lasted a few months.
292	00:17:13	00:17:14	Where is he?
293	00:17:14	00:17:15	We'd like to talk to him.
294	00:17:15	00:17:16	Well, I can't help you. He took off.
295	00:17:16	00:17:19	I mean, Jack was bad news.
296	00:17:19	00:17:20	He didn't love Vivian, only her money.
297	00:17:20	00:17:23	That day in the park, what did you and Haskell talk about?
298	00:17:23	00:17:26	Well, I could only hear about half of what he was saying.
299	00:17:26	00:17:28	That wasn't the deal!
300	00:17:28	00:17:30	I did what you asked. Where's Vivian?
301	00:17:30	00:17:32	Sounds like you two had a conversation.
302	00:17:32	00:17:34	He was yelling at me, making demands.
303	00:17:34	00:17:36	Most of it was about you.
304	00:17:36	00:17:37	That wasn't the deal.
305	00:17:37	00:17:40	That sounds like it was about you, pal.
306	00:17:40	00:17:42	I told you what I know.
307	00:17:42	00:17:44	He made no demands for ransom?
308	00:17:44	00:17:45	He gave you no instructions?
309	00:17:46	00:17:51	We have a warrant for your computer, bank records, cell phone and credit cards.
310	00:17:51	00:17:55	We're going to take a very long look at everything in your life.
311	00:18:03	00:18:05	This blood's dry and flaky.
312	00:18:05	00:18:07	It's days old.
313	00:18:07	00:18:10	Matches the time line of the maggots I found on the bodies.
314	00:18:10	00:18:13	No bone chips, no bone fragments.
315	00:18:13	00:18:16	Not enough blood to suggest dismemberment.
316	00:18:16	00:18:20	They might have been killed here, but they were probably cut up somewhere else.
317	00:18:30	00:18:32	Small blood trace.
318	00:18:32	00:18:34	Looks like he just stripped these off.
319	00:18:34	00:18:41	You know, I think Dr. Kole might have been seeing a patient right before he became one of these blood pools.
320	00:18:45	00:18:47	Got a chart.
321	00:18:47	00:18:50	Medical sticker's been ripped off.
322	00:18:50	00:18:52	It's empty.
323	00:18:52	00:18:55	Maybe the patient had something to do with this.
324	00:18:55	00:18:59	Okay, so, the patient kills the doctor and the nurse?
325	00:18:59	00:19:05	If the doctor was working on someone with the nurse by his side, this second blood pool's probably hers.
326	00:19:05	00:19:13	And the spider trajectory points back to the doorway, and not to the patient.
327	00:19:13	00:19:14	Maybe the shooter.
328	00:19:14	00:19:15	A little groggy, huh?
329	00:19:15	00:19:17	You're looking good.
330	00:19:17	00:19:18	Hey, what are you doing here?
331	00:19:28	00:19:30	Bullet-- looks like a nine mill.
332	00:19:30	00:19:32	Hmm. I don't see any cartridge casings.
333	00:19:32	00:19:34	Well, one of the victims was definitely shot.
334	00:19:34	00:19:35	There's tissue on the bullet.
335	00:19:35	00:19:37	Through and through.
336	00:19:37	00:19:42	We need to get this back to the lab, see if the tissue on the bullet matches the hands or the torso.
337	00:20:40	00:20:45	Uh, Ms. Kole?
338	00:20:45	00:20:47	Hi. I'm CSI Stokes.
339	00:20:47	00:20:50	I'm very sorry for your loss.
340	00:20:50	00:20:53	Boy, is my life starting to look up.
341	00:20:54	00:20:56	I need to get your fingerprints.
342	00:20:56	00:20:59	If you can get past these, be my guest.
343	00:20:59	00:21:00	We'll see what we can do.
344	00:21:00	00:21:02	Why don't you have a seat for me?
345	00:21:02	00:21:07	By the way, I didn't kill my crappy husband.
346	00:21:07	00:21:11	Well, if you didn't kill your crappy husband, who do you think did?
347	00:21:11	00:21:14	Did you know that Vegas is the fugitive capital of the world?
348	00:21:14	00:21:16	I didn't know that. Yeah.
349	00:21:16	00:21:17	Right hand, please.
350	00:21:17	00:21:23	And, uh, Graham did a few, um, faces, if you know what I mean.
351	00:21:23	00:21:24	I get it. Do you?
352	00:21:24	00:21:26	Yeah. Please.
353	00:21:26	00:21:29	So, when was the last time that you saw Graham?
354	00:21:29	00:21:31	When he told me to turn my vibrator down.
355	00:21:31	00:21:33	He didn't speak to me for weeks.
356	00:21:33	00:21:36	It was a Monday, so it must have been about five days ago.
357	00:21:36	00:21:39	And when he didn't come home, how come you just didn't call the police?
358	00:21:39	00:21:41	Because I knew where he was.
359	00:21:41	00:21:43	He was either at the Wynn or the Encore.
360	00:21:43	00:21:47	Hmm. And why would he stay at a hotel if he's got a house here in town?
361	00:21:47	00:21:48	Because he doesn't have a vibrator.
362	00:21:48	00:21:50	And he would be bringing home the real thing.
363	00:21:50	00:21:56	And then I would be up all night long listening to nothing but, Oh! Oh, God.
364	00:21:56	00:21:59	Oh, Graham, you're the best.
365	00:21:59	00:22:03	Oh, gosh, there's nobody like you.
366	00:22:03	00:22:06	Guys like fake.
367	00:22:06	00:22:07	Some guys do.
368	00:22:07	00:22:12	Oh, okay. And do you have any idea who this affair might have been with?
369	00:22:12	00:22:13	Nursey Newtox.
370	00:22:13	00:22:15	You know what you need to do?
371	00:22:15	00:22:32	Tell me. You need to put up Wanted posters of a girl who looks just like me-- minus 20 years-- with a touch of silicon, a dash of collagen, rhino, Botox and lipo, and the perkiest double-D's you've seen this side of the Hoover Dam.
372	00:22:32	00:22:34	And this nurse, does she have a name?
373	00:22:34	00:22:35	Teagan. Teagan.
374	00:22:35	00:22:36	Teagan Murphy.
375	00:22:36	00:22:40	I mean, who has a name like Teagan? Mm.
376	00:22:40	00:22:42	Right? Give me a break.
377	00:22:47	00:22:50	I got a name on Kole's nurse.
378	00:22:50	00:22:52	I ran her through the DMV.
379	00:22:52	00:22:53	I'm heading over there right now.
380	00:22:53	00:22:57	Should be able to pull some exemplars for DNA.
381	00:22:57	00:22:58	You all right, bud?
382	00:22:59	00:23:06	The bullet that we found at Kole's office is a match to the gun used during Haskell's escape.
383	00:23:06	00:23:08	Whoa, wait a minute.
384	00:23:08	00:23:11	Now, that gun was fired by one of Haskell's brides.
385	00:23:11	00:23:15	And if the gun was at Kole's office, one of the brides was there.
386	00:23:15	00:23:19	And the brides go... where Haskell goes.
387	00:23:19	00:23:26	If Haskell was at that office, do you think there's a chance he had some plastic surgery, changed his face?
388	00:23:26	00:23:30	And killed the doctor and his nurse to cover his tracks.
389	00:23:30	00:23:34	If we're right about this, Haskell could be just another face in the crowd.
390	00:23:34	00:23:36	Which means we don't know who we're looking for anymore.
391	00:23:41	00:23:45	Here's what we have Haskell's out there, and he may have a new face.
392	00:23:45	00:23:47	Well, the new face is a game changer.
393	00:23:47	00:23:48	I'm sick of this guy.
394	00:23:48	00:23:50	He's like the Joker in Batman.
395	00:23:50	00:23:52	Except without the laughs.
396	00:23:52	00:23:56	We have no hard evidence that puts Haskell at the plastic surgeon's.
397	00:23:56	00:23:58	That may be wishful thinking.
398	00:23:58	00:24:03	Ballistics only puts a gun, used by one of Haskell's brides, at the scene.
399	00:24:03	00:24:08	After the trial, I saw all of Haskell's brides, including Tina, in the parking lot.
400	00:24:08	00:24:10	The only ones that weren't there were Robin and Vivian.
401	00:24:10	00:24:14	Well, we know it wasn't Robin that talked to Kole, because she was popped during the escape.
402	00:24:14	00:24:18	Most likely by Vivian after she shot the four prison guards.
403	00:24:18	00:24:23	If Vivian is Bonnie to Haskell's Clyde, why is Haskell holding her for ransom?
404	00:24:25	00:24:27	He's not.
405	00:24:27	00:24:29	The timeline's wrong.
406	00:24:29	00:24:35	While Daddy's getting a video of his little girl begging for her life, Vivian is off killing the doctor and the nurse.
407	00:24:35	00:24:37	So Haskell and Vivian are working together.
408	00:24:37	00:24:39	There was no kidnapping.
409	00:24:39	00:24:43	So why the dog-and-pony show at the park?
410	00:24:43	00:24:47	I don't know, but it must have something to do with Haskell sending me this photograph of Vivian's ex.
411	00:24:47	00:24:49	Well, Tinsdale knows, but he's not talking.
412	00:24:50	00:24:52	Hey, Archie.
413	00:24:52	00:24:54	Be right there.
414	00:24:54	00:24:56	We may not need Tinsdale.
415	00:24:56	00:24:58	What have you got, Archie?
416	00:24:58	00:25:03	Yeah, well, Tinsdale didn't help us out at the park, but his computer is helping us out plenty.
417	00:25:03	00:25:06	That video file he brought in wasn't the first message he got from Haskell.
418	00:25:06	00:25:08	You got to be kidding me. Nope.
419	00:25:08	00:25:10	I pulled this off of deep memory.
420	00:25:10	00:25:11	Must've thought he deleted it.
421	00:25:11	00:25:12	When did this video file come in?
422	00:25:12	00:25:14	One week before the one he showed us.
423	00:25:14	00:25:15	Put it up, put it up, put it up.
424	00:25:15	00:25:18	I'm sorry I can't get a better image quality here.
425	00:25:18	00:25:22	You have been so generous with me already, Avery, giving me your daughter.
426	00:25:22	00:25:25	She is such a fragile flower.
427	00:25:25	00:25:28	And we both know why.
428	00:25:28	00:25:29	She's told me some secrets.
429	00:25:29	00:25:32	Very naughty, Avery.
430	00:25:32	00:25:34	Yet the more I hear about you, the more I like you.
431	00:25:34	00:25:36	You're my kind of guy.
432	00:25:36	00:25:41	But not everyone is as open-minded as I am, Avery, so you're gonna have to open your wallet.
433	00:25:41	00:25:46	It's so tawdry to talk about amounts, but how about $2 million?
434	00:25:46	00:25:47	That's it.
435	00:25:47	00:25:53	Now we know why Haskell made no ransom demand and why Tinsdale showed no real interest in getting his daughter back.
436	00:25:53	00:25:55	This is all about blackmail.
437	00:25:55	00:25:57	Haskell had already been paid.
438	00:25:57	00:26:00	Secrets between father and daughter.
439	00:26:00	00:26:03	Clearly, Vivian's bad taste in men started early.
440	00:26:03	00:26:06	If Tinsdale wanted to hide his dirty little secret, why would he come forward?
441	00:26:06	00:26:08	Because Haskell forced him to.
442	00:26:08	00:26:11	I pulled Tinsdale's bank records.
443	00:26:11	00:26:14	He withdrew $2 million, in cash, five days ago.
444	00:26:14	00:26:18	Told the bank manager it was for some offshore investment deal.
445	00:26:18	00:26:20	(scoffs) He lied to us.
446	00:26:20	00:26:24	He just bought Haskell $2 million worth of freedom, the son of a bitch.
447	00:26:24	00:26:28	I know where you're going, Ray. Don't try to stop me, Catherine! Okay, then go ahead.
448	00:26:28	00:26:31	You'll be doing exactly what Haskell wants you to do.
449	00:26:31	00:26:34	Haskell sent you Jack York's photo for a reason.
450	00:26:35	00:26:39	York disappeared right after he married Vivian.
451	00:26:41	00:26:43	He came between father and daughter.
452	00:26:43	00:26:45	Maybe Tinsdale killed him.
453	00:26:45	00:26:48	Vivian knew about it.
454	00:26:48	00:26:49	She told Haskell.
455	00:26:49	00:26:50	This is a game.
456	00:26:50	00:26:53	This is a dance between you and Haskell.
457	00:26:53	00:26:55	Haskell isn't talking to Tinsdale on the video.
458	00:26:55	00:26:57	He's talking to you.
459	00:26:57	00:26:58	Catch me if you can.
460	00:26:58	00:27:00	Well, he wants to play...
461	00:27:00	00:27:02	Ray.
462	00:27:09	00:27:12	What do you want me to do, boss?
463	00:27:12	00:27:14	You don't do this alone.
464	00:27:14	00:27:17	We go after Haskell together.
465	00:27:34	00:27:37	Mrs. Tinsdale, are you all right?
466	00:27:37	00:27:39	What happened?
467	00:27:39	00:27:42	My husband's in the study.
468	00:27:56	00:27:57	He's dead.
469	00:27:57	00:27:59	.38 special.
470	00:27:59	00:28:02	So, you think it's suicide or an assist from the wife?
471	00:28:02	00:28:04	I'm checking both both for GSR.
472	00:28:04	00:28:05	Contact wound.
473	00:28:05	00:28:07	Single exit to the back of the head.
474	00:28:07	00:28:12	The pattern on the wall is consistent with an upward angle.
475	00:28:15	00:28:18	Bullet exited the head and entered the wall.
476	00:28:18	00:28:22	The blood on Mrs. Tinsdale is probably transfer from embracing him.
477	00:28:22	00:28:23	Well, why kill himself now?
478	00:28:23	00:28:26	He already paid Haskell $2 million for his silence.
479	00:28:26	00:28:28	Take a look around.
480	00:28:28	00:28:29	Maybe Haskell wanted more money.
481	00:28:29	00:28:31	Didn't we take his computer, Jim?
482	00:28:31	00:28:33	He bought himself a new one.
483	00:28:35	00:28:36	Looks like new video.
484	00:28:36	00:28:38	Avery, I know we had a deal.
485	00:28:38	00:28:40	I really appreciate the money.
486	00:28:40	00:28:45	Financial security in... in midlife is so important.
487	00:28:45	00:28:50	But, Avery, the... the home movies that Vivian has shown me-- not the...
488	00:28:50	00:28:52	family trip to Washington.
489	00:28:52	00:28:53	The other one.
490	00:28:53	00:28:55	You know, I'm not a...
491	00:28:55	00:29:00	fan of the police or the church, but what you did was a sin.
492	00:29:00	00:29:03	So I do have to file-share it with my friends in uniform.
493	00:29:03	00:29:04	I have no choice.
494	00:29:04	00:29:06	Oh, and, Ray...
495	00:29:06	00:29:09	there isa moral to this story.
496	00:29:18	00:29:21	It wasn't his fault.
497	00:29:21	00:29:23	He didn't want it.
498	00:29:23	00:29:24	Excuse me?
499	00:29:24	00:29:27	She came to him.
500	00:29:28	00:29:30	Vivian... was a child.
501	00:29:30	00:29:32	You were her mother.
502	00:29:32	00:29:34	It was your job to protect her.
503	00:29:34	00:29:39	Do you think it's strange that I gave birth to the true bride of my husband?
504	00:30:26	00:30:27	Hey.
505	00:30:27	00:30:30	Hey. Did you, uh, you got the DNA results?
506	00:30:30	00:30:33	Are you sure you got all the body parts that were out at that farm?
507	00:30:33	00:30:37	I'm sure I'm not gonna like what you're about to tell me.
508	00:30:37	00:30:43	Well, the major blood pool from Kole's office matches exemplars from Dr. Kole.
509	00:30:43	00:30:50	Okay. The secondary blood pool plus the tissue from the bullet you pulled out of the wall is a match to the nurse. Go on.
510	00:30:50	00:30:54	The DNA from the nurse is not a match to your torso.
511	00:30:54	00:30:57	But if that torso isn't the nurse, then who is it?
512	00:30:57	00:31:01	And what's it doing in a haystack with the doctor's hands?
513	00:31:01	00:31:02	Good question.
514	00:31:02	00:31:06	Okay, at least tell me the patient on the tape was Haskell.
515	00:31:06	00:31:07	Well...
516	00:31:07	00:31:09	Oh, come on, man, you're killing me.
517	00:31:09	00:31:12	The blood was definitely male, but not in the system.
518	00:31:12	00:31:13	And not Haskell.
519	00:31:13	00:31:16	So it's possible we're looking for another victim.
520	00:31:16	00:31:17	And more parts, too.
521	00:31:17	00:31:19	Let's get back out to that farm.
522	00:31:22	00:31:24	Looking for more body parts?
523	00:31:24	00:31:26	Thought you already did that.
524	00:31:26	00:31:31	No, actually, we'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind, Mr. Thorpe. Sure.
525	00:31:31	00:31:35	Do you recognize this man?
526	00:31:35	00:31:36	What about her?
527	00:31:36	00:31:37	Sorry, no.
528	00:31:37	00:31:40	Well, do you recognize any of these people?
529	00:31:40	00:31:41	Show him the rest of 'em.
530	00:31:41	00:31:43	Don't know this one.
531	00:31:43	00:31:49	But this other pretty girl, that's my cousin's daughter Tina.
532	00:31:50	00:31:52	You're related to Tina Vincent?
533	00:31:52	00:31:55	She's Irma's sister's fourth daughter.
534	00:31:55	00:31:57	Wild one.
535	00:31:57	00:31:59	Wild in the eye.
536	00:31:59	00:32:02	She's been staying out here for a bit.
537	00:32:02	00:32:05	What's this about? What about this man?
538	00:32:05	00:32:08	He's a friend of Tina's.
539	00:32:08	00:32:10	Can't say for sure.
540	00:32:10	00:32:16	But one day this fella showed up, kind of squirrelly, and they started shacking up.
541	00:32:16	00:32:20	The guy was in a car accident; face was bandaged.
542	00:32:20	00:32:22	Could be him.
543	00:32:22	00:32:25	And do you know where Tina and this squirrelly guy are shacking up?
544	00:32:26	00:32:29	The old house across the road.
545	00:32:48	00:32:50	(sighs) Tire tracks.
546	00:32:50	00:32:52	Wide tread.
547	00:32:55	00:32:57	Yellow paint over there says low clearance.
548	00:32:57	00:32:59	High-end sports car.
549	00:33:05	00:33:07	Driver left in a hurry.
550	00:33:23	00:33:26	Not using much juice.
551	00:33:27	00:33:29	No water flow.
552	00:33:37	00:33:40	Electronics gear.
553	00:33:40	00:33:44	Think we just found where those videos came from.
554	00:33:44	00:33:45	I can see you.
555	00:33:45	00:33:46	What do you mean?
556	00:33:46	00:33:49	Inside, on the monitor.
557	00:33:56	00:33:58	Found a minivan around back.
558	00:33:58	00:33:59	It's clean.
559	00:33:59	00:34:00	Backup's still ten minutes out.
560	00:34:00	00:34:02	What do you want to do?
561	00:34:02	00:34:05	Let's get it on.
562	00:34:08	00:34:10	Let me take it, Nick.
563	00:34:32	00:34:34	You hear that?
564	00:34:34	00:34:35	It's music.
565	00:35:08	00:35:10	Smell that?
566	00:35:10	00:35:11	It's decomp.
567	00:35:11	00:35:14	Snap, crackle, maggot.
568	00:35:30	00:35:34	That's Bach's cello solo in G.
569	00:35:34	00:35:36	I studied the cello; it's a beautiful piece.
570	00:35:36	00:35:38	Man, that's just not right.
571	00:35:58	00:36:01	Talk about not right.
572	00:36:04	00:36:06	Well, we hit the jackpot.
573	00:36:06	00:36:12	Found the rest of Dr. Kole, his nurse, what was left of Vivian Tinsdale, and a bonus body.
574	00:36:12	00:36:13	That the I.D.? Yeah.
575	00:36:13	00:36:16	Calvin Frost, white male, San Diego address.
576	00:36:16	00:36:20	He rented an exotic car on the Strip a week ago-- yellow Porsche.
577	00:36:20	00:36:21	Never returned it.
578	00:36:21	00:36:22	So where's the car now?
579	00:36:22	00:36:24	We're still looking for it.
580	00:36:24	00:36:27	But the blood on the gloves in the doctor's office came back as a match to Frost.
581	00:36:27	00:36:30	Which makes him Dr. Kole's last patient.
582	00:36:46	00:36:48	I found Calvin Frost's chart.
583	00:36:48	00:36:50	New patient.
584	00:36:50	00:36:53	First visit... day of the murders.
585	00:36:53	00:36:59	Says that he tripped and took a header in the men's room at the Orpheus, and Kole stitched him up.
586	00:36:59	00:37:04	So he had the bad luck of being on the table when Haskell and Vivian showed up, making him collateral damage.
587	00:37:04	00:37:10	We thought the chart that we found on the floor belonged to the guy on the table, so if I'm holding Frost's file, whose empty chart did we find?
588	00:37:10	00:37:12	Haskell's.
589	00:37:12	00:37:16	He killed the doctor and the nurse and probably took his records to cover his tracks.
590	00:37:16	00:37:19	Well, I'll print Frost's chart and see who put it back into the cabinet.
591	00:37:19	00:37:24	Well, if we find Haskell's fingerprints, that means he was still in Vegas four or five days ago.
592	00:37:24	00:37:30	Welcome to the chop shop-- body parts here, bodies across the hall.
593	00:37:30	00:37:32	David, I'd like to see Vivian's hands, please.
594	00:37:32	00:37:36	Well, I got two lefts and a right.
595	00:37:36	00:37:39	Now, Dr. Robbins used tool marks to determine which hands were Vivian's.
596	00:37:39	00:37:41	I used nail polish.
597	00:37:41	00:37:44	Vivian is wearing Fuchsia Flare.
598	00:37:48	00:37:49	Positive for lead.
599	00:37:51	00:37:54	Vivian fired a gun shortly before she was killed.
600	00:37:58	00:38:00	Doc.
601	00:38:00	00:38:03	I know you're anxious for answers.
602	00:38:03	00:38:06	Dr. Kole took a nine- mil in the chest.
603	00:38:06	00:38:08	Nurse had a nine-mil perforate her head.
604	00:38:08	00:38:11	There's your through and through. What about Calvin Frost here?
605	00:38:11	00:38:14	Like Vivian Tinsdale, he was shot in the head. T.O.D.?
606	00:38:14	00:38:18	All four victims were killed within hours of each other, four to five days ago.
607	00:38:18	00:38:19	You didn't feel a thing, did you?
608	00:38:19	00:38:20	Thank God.
609	00:38:22	00:38:24	Hey, what are you doing? Aah!
610	00:38:24	00:38:32	So, the evidence says that Vivian was our shooter, but we have no evidence that Calvin Frost was killed at the office.
611	00:38:32	00:38:35	If they're going to kill him anyway, why not shoot him there?
612	00:38:35	00:38:38	Maybe Haskell and Vivian needed someone to help them carry the bodies.
613	00:38:38	00:38:43	So they drove out to the house, shot Frost, and then commenced to choppin'?
614	00:38:43	00:38:48	Then someone used the same gun to shoot Vivian and then began chopping her up.
615	00:38:48	00:38:49	Haskell?
616	00:38:49	00:38:52	Chopping up bodies and leaving the job unfinished?
617	00:38:52	00:38:55	Leaving parts in a haystack and then the rest in a bathtub?
618	00:38:55	00:38:58	Whatever Haskell is, he's not disorganized.
619	00:38:58	00:38:59	That's not his M.O.
620	00:38:59	00:39:01	Hmm.
621	00:39:01	00:39:04	Tina... Tina.
622	00:39:04	00:39:08	She was his connection to the farm, she was his eyes at the park.
623	00:39:08	00:39:10	She's his new number one.
624	00:39:36	00:39:38	Hey, Catherine.
625	00:39:38	00:39:41	I traced the serial numbers from the electronics at the farmhouse.
626	00:39:41	00:39:47	All purchased by Tina Vincent, and here's the kicker-- I pulled the metadata off her video camera's SD card.
627	00:39:47	00:39:55	All those videos Haskell sent to Tinsdale-- all recorded on the same day eight weeks ago, specifically on the day after Haskell escaped.
628	00:39:55	00:39:58	He's been playing us this whole time.
629	00:39:58	00:39:59	I printed Frost's chart.
630	00:39:59	00:40:04	Tina Vincent was all over it, yet we didn't find a single Haskell print in that entire office.
631	00:40:04	00:40:07	Doesn't mean he wasn't there, just not lately.
632	00:40:07	00:40:10	Well, we do know that both Tina and Vivian were at the scene.
633	00:40:10	00:40:13	Vivian's dead and Tina Vincent's in the wind.
634	00:40:13	00:40:16	We won't find her or Haskell, not looking here.
635	00:40:16	00:40:19	They're not in Vegas.
636	00:40:19	00:40:27	The video, the ransom demand, the park, the murders at Dr. Kole's-- they were all intended to make us think that Haskell was still here in Vegas.
637	00:40:27	00:40:29	And now you think he isn't?
638	00:40:29	00:40:35	Eight weeks ago, Haskell escaped from custody with Vivian's help.
639	00:40:36	00:40:40	Then he went to Dr. Kole's for plastic surgery.
640	00:40:40	00:40:48	Then he and Tina started making movies of Vivian in the old house to send to Daddy.
641	00:40:48	00:40:50	Nate was careful to stay in the background.
642	00:40:50	00:40:54	He didn't want us to know that he'd changed his face.
643	00:40:54	00:40:59	Then he sent the two brides to kill the doctor and the nurse.
644	00:40:59	00:41:10	They removed his chart but not before they kidnapped the patient on the table, took his car, his clothes, and the two bodies, brought them back to the house where they murdered him.
645	00:41:17	00:41:19	And that's when bride turned on bride.
646	00:41:21	00:41:25	Then Tina murdered Vivian.
647	00:41:25	00:41:28	Now Tina starts to chop up the bodies.
648	00:41:28	00:41:35	She disperses the body parts sloppily, scattering them, not unlike her scattered mind.
649	00:41:38	00:41:44	Two days later, Tina shows up in a park to keep an eye on Mr. Tinsdale.
650	00:41:44	00:41:45	Then she disappears.
651	00:41:45	00:41:49	Haskell and Tina-- they're both fugitives.
652	00:41:49	00:41:51	Traveling as a couple draws less attention.
653	00:41:51	00:41:58	So Haskell's got a new face, $2 million, trades in his old bride for a younger one and gets a new car in the deal.
654	00:41:58	00:42:02	Plastic surgery, cash, bimbo, Porsche.
655	00:42:02	00:42:07	Well, if he's not in Vegas, I can think of another place he might fit in.
656	00:42:07	00:42:10	We need to call LAPD.
657	00:43:01	00:43:02	Thank you.
658	00:43:08	00:43:11	Isn't she just heavenly?
659	00:43:11	00:43:13	I think so.
660	00:43:13	00:43:15	She's my wife.
661	00:43:16	00:43:18	Really!
662	00:43:18	00:43:21	You're a very lucky man.
