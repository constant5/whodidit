0	00:00:04	00:00:06	You ever seen anything like that?
1	00:00:06	00:00:09	I don't even know what I'm looking at.
2	00:00:09	00:00:11	That's just wrong.
3	00:00:11	00:00:14	Lucky for you, I come prepared for this type of crisis.
4	00:00:18	00:00:19	Habanero Massacre?
5	00:00:19	00:00:21	Mmm!
6	00:00:21	00:00:24	It's a mercy killing on a burrito this bad.
7	00:00:25	00:00:27	Whoa, whoa, whoa, girl. You sure about that?
8	00:00:41	00:00:42	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
9	00:00:46	00:00:48	Control, this is CSI Brody.
10	00:00:48	00:00:52	We've got a single-car collision, Tropicana, block east of Nash, injuries.
11	00:00:52	00:00:53	Paramedics are on their way.
12	00:00:53	00:00:56	He's got a pulse, but he's lost a lot of blood.
13	00:00:56	00:00:57	He's got a really nasty head wound here.
14	00:00:57	00:00:59	We've gotta move.
15	00:00:59	00:01:00	Engine's going up.
16	00:01:00	00:01:02	All right, I'm gonna try to get him out of here.
17	00:01:02	00:01:03	Come on, boy, I got you.
18	00:01:03	00:01:05	I'll get his legs. Come on. Come on.
19	00:01:05	00:01:07	Come on.
20	00:01:07	00:01:08	Okay...
21	00:01:08	00:01:10	Get him far enough back now. I'm trying.
22	00:01:10	00:01:11	Ah, that's good, that's good.
23	00:01:16	00:01:17	Wes Clyborn.
24	00:01:17	00:01:18	Seven Hills address.
25	00:01:18	00:01:21	Wes, Wes, my name's Nick.
26	00:01:21	00:01:22	You hang in there now.
27	00:01:22	00:01:23	Help's on the way.
28	00:01:23	00:01:25	Damn. What?
29	00:01:25	00:01:27	He didn't hit his head. This is a gunshot wound.
30	00:01:27	00:01:30	I didn't hear a shot before the crash.
31	00:01:30	00:01:32	I definitely didn't hear two.
32	00:01:32	00:01:34	I think that's a second GSW to the abdomen.
33	00:01:34	00:01:36	Looks like the same caliber.
34	00:01:36	00:01:38	They're-they're-they're bleeding.
35	00:01:38	00:01:39	What are you trying to say, Wes?
36	00:01:42	00:01:43	They're dying.
37	00:01:43	00:01:44	Who's dying, Wes?
38	00:01:44	00:01:46	Wes, talk to me.
39	00:01:46	00:01:47	Who's dying?
40	00:02:23	00:02:24	Grab those doors for us? Hang in there, Wes.
41	00:02:24	00:02:25	You're in good hands now, bud.
42	00:02:25	00:02:27	They're gonna take care of you.
43	00:02:27	00:02:29	We've got a GSW to head and abdomen.
44	00:02:29	00:02:30	Okay. Get him on the monitor.
45	00:02:30	00:02:32	Full set of stat labs.
46	00:02:32	00:02:34	Type and cross for packed red cells for transfusion.
47	00:02:37	00:02:39	We have O-neg standing by.
48	00:02:39	00:02:41	16 or 18 gauge.
49	00:02:41	00:02:43	Excuse me, Nurse, I'm with the Crime Lab.
50	00:02:43	00:02:46	I'm gonna need to take the clothes he's wearing with me, okay?
51	00:02:46	00:02:48	I'll see what I can do.
52	00:02:48	00:02:49	Prep him for a central line.
53	00:02:49	00:02:50	(alarm beeping) Code blue.
54	00:02:50	00:02:51	He's in V-Tach.
55	00:02:51	00:02:52	Okay. Clear the room.
56	00:02:52	00:02:54	That includes you, Crime Lab.
57	00:02:54	00:02:56	Yes, sir.
58	00:02:56	00:02:59	Thank you. Charge to 200.
59	00:02:59	00:03:01	100 milligrams.
60	00:03:05	00:03:07	Hey. Oh, hey.
61	00:03:07	00:03:08	Morgan called.
62	00:03:08	00:03:10	Told me you'd followed the victim here.
63	00:03:10	00:03:12	Wow, look at you.
64	00:03:12	00:03:13	You all right? Uh, yeah.
65	00:03:13	00:03:15	I'm fine.
66	00:03:15	00:03:17	But, man, this guy's in really bad shape.
67	00:03:17	00:03:18	And here's the thing.
68	00:03:18	00:03:23	He said that there are others, and that they're dying or dead.
69	00:03:23	00:03:25	I'm not really sure what to make of it.
70	00:03:25	00:03:27	So you think there's another crime scene out there?
71	00:03:27	00:03:29	Maybe more victims, too, you know what I mean?
72	00:03:29	00:03:30	Okay.
73	00:03:30	00:03:32	Why don't you clean yourself up.
74	00:03:32	00:03:35	I took the liberty of bringing you a shirt from your locker.
75	00:03:35	00:03:39	Thanks. You hang here, if our guy pulls through, maybe he'll tell you something.
76	00:03:39	00:03:41	More than just thank you.
77	00:03:42	00:03:44	Hey, Nick...
78	00:03:44	00:03:46	way to go.
79	00:03:46	00:03:47	That took a lot of guts.
80	00:03:47	00:03:49	Thanks.
81	00:03:56	00:04:00	Registration belongs to Elena Perez, 35.
82	00:04:00	00:04:02	Vartann's checking out her address.
83	00:04:02	00:04:05	No known employer.
84	00:04:05	00:04:07	Looks like she's been living here.
85	00:04:07	00:04:12	Blood on the headrest is from transfer-- Wes Clyborn's head wound.
86	00:04:12	00:04:14	No high-velocity blood spatter.
87	00:04:14	00:04:16	No gunshot.
88	00:04:16	00:04:19	No HV on my side, either.
89	00:04:19	00:04:23	Significant blood pool on the driver's seat.
90	00:04:23	00:04:25	Probably from the shot to the abdomen.
91	00:04:25	00:04:28	That's a lot of blood. So...
92	00:04:28	00:04:29	not shot in the car.
93	00:04:29	00:04:31	Shot before he got in the car.
94	00:04:31	00:04:36	Losing blood, losing consciousness, he runs into the billboard truck.
95	00:04:36	00:04:39	You know, considering his condition, he couldn't have gotten more than a mile or two.
96	00:04:39	00:04:41	Couple of square miles...
97	00:04:41	00:04:44	and still a lot of ground to cover.
98	00:04:44	00:04:46	Our primary could be anywhere.
99	00:04:49	00:04:50	Crime Lab.
100	00:04:50	00:04:53	Hey. Well, I'm Nick. Stokes.
101	00:04:53	00:04:54	What's your name? I'm Lauren.
102	00:04:54	00:04:55	Lauren, nice to meet you.
103	00:04:55	00:04:56	Nice to meet you, too.
104	00:04:56	00:04:58	Yeah, thanks for your help. Sure.
105	00:04:58	00:05:00	I have the patient's clothing for you.
106	00:05:00	00:05:01	Okay. Good.
107	00:05:01	00:05:03	Sorry. Got a little scissory.
108	00:05:03	00:05:05	Oh, that's okay.
109	00:05:05	00:05:07	So... how's he doing?
110	00:05:07	00:05:09	He's good. Out of surgery.
111	00:05:09	00:05:11	Stable. Oh...
112	00:05:11	00:05:14	The doctor removed this from Mr. Clyborn's abdomen.
113	00:05:14	00:05:17	Fortunately, internal damage was minimal.
114	00:05:17	00:05:18	Only one bullet?
115	00:05:18	00:05:22	The one that penetrated his brain's gonna require more attention.
116	00:05:22	00:05:24	A neurosurgeon's flying in from L.A.
117	00:05:28	00:05:29	You've done this before.
118	00:05:29	00:05:32	Yeah, more times than any one person should have to.
119	00:05:34	00:05:37	The owner of the Grand Am, Elena Perez, was evicted from her place a month ago.
120	00:05:37	00:05:39	And no one has reported her missing.
121	00:05:39	00:05:41	So I'm working on a warrant for her cell phone records.
122	00:05:41	00:05:43	That might be the only way to track her down.
123	00:05:43	00:05:46	What about the cell phone that Nick recovered from the victim?
124	00:05:46	00:05:49	Yeah, Wes Clyborn. He's a popular guy.
125	00:05:49	00:05:51	I traced most of the calls to his friends.
126	00:05:51	00:05:54	And no one has ever heard of Elena Perez, and nobody knew where he was last night.
127	00:05:54	00:05:58	One thing, though-- the last few calls, they were all made to the same number.
128	00:05:58	00:06:00	Do we know who? There's no way to know.
129	00:06:00	00:06:01	It was a pay-as-you-go cell.
130	00:06:01	00:06:02	Oh, great.
131	00:06:02	00:06:04	So totally untraceable.
132	00:06:04	00:06:06	Bullet entered the left middle temporal lobe.
133	00:06:06	00:06:09	Houses the hippocampus and related structures.
134	00:06:09	00:06:11	Those are areas related to his memory, right?
135	00:06:11	00:06:12	Right.
136	00:06:12	00:06:15	Generally, retrograde amnesia exhibits a temporal gradient.
137	00:06:15	00:06:17	Last in, first out.
138	00:06:17	00:06:24	So things he learned in school, his mother's name, sense memories, there's a good chance they remain But the memory of who shot him last night...
139	00:06:24	00:06:25	May or may not be there. Okay.
140	00:06:25	00:06:28	So is he conscious? Fully.
141	00:06:28	00:06:32	Soon as the neurosurgeon arrives, we prep him for surgery, take him in.
142	00:06:32	00:06:33	What are his chances?
143	00:06:33	00:06:35	I don't think we'll know till we get in there.
144	00:06:35	00:06:38	So if you're going to talk to him, do it now.
145	00:06:38	00:06:39	Appreciate it. Yeah.
146	00:06:47	00:06:50	Hey.
147	00:06:50	00:06:51	Look at that.
148	00:06:51	00:06:52	He's conscious.
149	00:06:52	00:06:53	How you doing, man?
150	00:06:53	00:06:54	You look good.
151	00:06:54	00:06:55	Thank you.
152	00:06:55	00:06:57	Yeah. No.
153	00:06:57	00:06:59	Thank you.
154	00:07:00	00:07:03	The nurse said you saved me.
155	00:07:03	00:07:05	Yeah.
156	00:07:05	00:07:06	You don't remember any of that, huh?
157	00:07:07	00:07:09	No. I'm sorry.
158	00:07:09	00:07:11	Wait, you don't have to apologize to me, man.
159	00:07:11	00:07:12	You got a massive head wound.
160	00:07:12	00:07:14	It's gonna take some time.
161	00:07:14	00:07:17	So it's bad if the beeps stop, right?
162	00:07:17	00:07:19	It's not good, no.
163	00:07:19	00:07:20	But don't worry about that.
164	00:07:20	00:07:22	That's not gonna happen.
165	00:07:22	00:07:25	Do me a favor, Wes.
166	00:07:25	00:07:26	Let me see your hands.
167	00:07:26	00:07:30	If you were in a struggle with somebody, we might be able to find something that can help us out here.
168	00:07:30	00:07:31	Yeah, sure.
169	00:07:31	00:07:32	Whatever you need.
170	00:07:34	00:07:37	Ooh, looks like you put up a hell of a fight.
171	00:07:37	00:07:41	Why would anyone want to hurt our son? Did someone try and rob him?
172	00:07:41	00:07:42	We don't know that, sir.
173	00:07:42	00:07:44	That's what we're trying to find out.
174	00:07:44	00:07:46	You guys have any idea where he was last night?
175	00:07:46	00:07:48	No.
176	00:07:48	00:07:49	Well, do you know who he might've been with?
177	00:07:49	00:07:50	Wes has a lot of friends.
178	00:07:50	00:07:52	Okay.
179	00:07:52	00:07:53	But he still lives at home with you, right?
180	00:07:53	00:07:55	Yeah, since he graduated in May.
181	00:07:55	00:07:56	From 'SC.
182	00:07:56	00:07:58	He's still exploring his options.
183	00:07:58	00:08:00	We give Wes his space.
184	00:08:00	00:08:01	He comes and he goes.
185	00:08:01	00:08:03	Not much more we could tell you.
186	00:08:03	00:08:05	Except that he's a good boy.
187	00:08:05	00:08:06	Do you recognize this woman?
188	00:08:06	00:08:07	No.
189	00:08:07	00:08:09	Why?
190	00:08:09	00:08:10	Name's Elena Perez.
191	00:08:10	00:08:11	She's the owner of the car that Wes was driving.
192	00:08:11	00:08:13	I've never seen her before.
193	00:08:13	00:08:15	You're sure she's not a friend of his?
194	00:08:15	00:08:18	I've seen enough of Wes's friends to know this woman would definitely not fit in with any of them.
195	00:08:18	00:08:19	Now, if you'll excuse us...
196	00:08:19	00:08:21	we'd like to see our son.
197	00:08:27	00:08:30	Dad's not exactly Mr. Warmth, is he?
198	00:09:01	00:09:03	I think I found our other victims...
199	00:09:03	00:09:05	the ones the guy in the hospital was talking about.
200	00:09:05	00:09:07	What do you mean found them? Where? Here.
201	00:09:07	00:09:09	They're all over his shirt.
202	00:09:09	00:09:11	No surprise I found the victim's blood.
203	00:09:11	00:09:13	But I found three other contributors.
204	00:09:13	00:09:15	Three other people.
205	00:09:15	00:09:17	I know.
206	00:09:17	00:09:18	Is Elena Perez one of them?
207	00:09:18	00:09:20	Based on exemplars from her car, yes.
208	00:09:20	00:09:22	What about the other two?
209	00:09:22	00:09:24	One is male.
210	00:09:24	00:09:26	Familial match to Elena.
211	00:09:26	00:09:29	I ran it through CODIS and got a hit on her brother, Juan Perez.
212	00:09:29	00:09:32	Convictions for assault, armed robbery...
213	00:09:32	00:09:34	and, oh, yeah, carjacking.
214	00:09:34	00:09:36	Paroled six months ago.
215	00:09:36	00:09:37	What about the last contributor?
216	00:09:37	00:09:39	Unknown female.
217	00:09:39	00:09:40	Wow.
218	00:09:40	00:09:43	Look at all that carnage.
219	00:09:43	00:09:46	Wonder what the hell happened right before Wes Clyborn got in that car?
220	00:09:46	00:09:47	I don't know.
221	00:09:47	00:09:49	I can't get you any closer to the primary.
222	00:09:49	00:09:54	I don't have any answers about what might have happened or how.
223	00:09:54	00:09:55	Or why.
224	00:09:55	00:09:58	All I have is blood.
225	00:09:58	00:10:00	Sometimes blood is all you need.
226	00:10:02	00:10:04	Oh, boy.
227	00:10:04	00:10:05	Wish me luck.
228	00:10:05	00:10:06	Where are you going?
229	00:10:06	00:10:07	We need a blood whisperer.
230	00:10:21	00:10:23	No signs of forced entry.
231	00:10:23	00:10:26	Victim probably knew her assailant.
232	00:10:26	00:10:30	Could have been a hotel employee who had a key...
233	00:10:30	00:10:31	who had access.
234	00:10:33	00:10:35	M.E. estimates time of death around midnight.
235	00:10:35	00:10:40	C.O.D. is blunt force trauma, consistent with the claw hammer.
236	00:10:40	00:10:41	Yeah.
237	00:10:45	00:10:46	Oh! You're killing me.
238	00:10:46	00:10:48	Tell me something I don't know.
239	00:10:50	00:10:54	Guys, your bosses are paying me a lot of money for this seminar.
240	00:10:54	00:10:56	Come on!
241	00:10:56	00:10:58	Okay, I'll give you a hint.
242	00:10:58	00:11:01	Look at my body.
243	00:11:01	00:11:04	The position of my body.
244	00:11:04	00:11:06	Right, sorry, got it, um...
245	00:11:07	00:11:08	Your hand appears to be extending outward.
246	00:11:08	00:11:09	Good, good.
247	00:11:09	00:11:12	Why is that significant?
248	00:11:12	00:11:14	Look at the blood smear.
249	00:11:14	00:11:16	I've made a blood angel here. Why?
250	00:11:16	00:11:26	Well, at first blush, it looks like you're trying to reach your cell phone that fell under the lamp there, but the blood angel shows that your arm stopped, so you didn't get the phone.
251	00:11:26	00:11:28	You didn't call 911.
252	00:11:28	00:11:29	You got any ideas?
253	00:11:29	00:11:32	The assailant's still in the room.
254	00:11:32	00:11:34	She's afraid to call.
255	00:11:34	00:11:37	Jules, what do you say?
256	00:11:37	00:11:43	I say he's close, and there's only one person in the world who would dare to call me Jules.
257	00:11:47	00:11:50	(chuckles) Okay, guys, that's a 482.
258	00:11:50	00:11:52	We'll pick up after lunch.
259	00:11:57	00:11:59	I know what you're thinking.
260	00:11:59	00:12:01	Of all the mock crime scenes in all the world...
261	00:12:01	00:12:03	No, that is not what I'm thinking.
262	00:12:03	00:12:06	It's good to see you.
263	00:12:06	00:12:08	I like your scene. Are you on the registration list?
264	00:12:08	00:12:14	Uh, no. Because I know you don't like to make social calls unless, of course, you want to make your wife happy, and I don't see her around.
265	00:12:14	00:12:16	So what do you want, Mr. Russell?
266	00:12:16	00:12:18	Straight to the point, as usual.
267	00:12:18	00:12:22	Okay, uh... I need a little help.
268	00:12:22	00:12:29	Open case-- blood's all we got, but, oh, it's a good one.
269	00:12:29	00:12:30	We know how it ended last time.
270	00:12:30	00:12:35	Yes, yes, that's true, uh, but this is just one case.
271	00:12:35	00:12:38	I'm already working a crime scene.
272	00:12:38	00:12:40	You sure?
273	00:12:40	00:12:41	Yeah. Okay.
274	00:12:41	00:12:43	Well, worth a shot.
275	00:12:44	00:12:46	Oh, yeah, uh, before I go, I almost forgot.
276	00:12:46	00:12:57	The assailant was still in the room, uh, but your arm was reaching out but not to grab your cell phone but to motion to your daughter, tell her to stay hidden.
277	00:12:59	00:13:08	I know you... you think you hate me, but the whole, uh, lying on the floor, playing the victim thing kind of says you miss me.
278	00:13:11	00:13:12	Or not.
279	00:13:13	00:13:14	Okay.
280	00:13:39	00:13:40	Lauren.
281	00:13:40	00:13:41	Hey. Got your message.
282	00:13:41	00:13:42	What's going on?
283	00:13:42	00:13:44	It's Wes Clyborn.
284	00:13:44	00:13:45	Is he all right?
285	00:13:45	00:13:46	He's a little worked up.
286	00:13:46	00:13:48	What do you mean? Why?
287	00:13:48	00:13:49	I don't know, he won't talk to me.
288	00:13:49	00:13:50	Keeps asking for you.
289	00:13:50	00:13:52	All right, cool, I'll talk to him.
290	00:13:52	00:13:54	Okay. Thanks.
291	00:13:54	00:13:57	Hey, it's good to see your appetite.
292	00:13:57	00:13:58	But you didn't eat the Jell-O.
293	00:13:58	00:13:59	I remember something.
294	00:13:59	00:14:01	Okay.
295	00:14:01	00:14:04	Remember something from last night?
296	00:14:04	00:14:06	I was in a room.
297	00:14:06	00:14:07	A room.
298	00:14:07	00:14:09	What kind of room? Do you recognize it?
299	00:14:09	00:14:15	No, I'd never been there before, but th-there was a man.
300	00:14:15	00:14:16	And he had a gun.
301	00:14:16	00:14:19	Do you recognize him, know his name?
302	00:14:19	00:14:20	No.
303	00:14:25	00:14:28	Was it that dude?
304	00:14:32	00:14:34	I tried to fight this guy off.
305	00:14:34	00:14:36	Don't worry about it. He had a gun.
306	00:14:40	00:14:44	Next thing I remember, I was running.
307	00:14:44	00:14:48	I had car keys, but they weren't mine.
308	00:14:48	00:14:49	I-I took her car.
309	00:14:49	00:14:50	Her?
310	00:14:50	00:14:53	Do you mean Elena? Elena Perez?
311	00:14:54	00:14:56	I don't know. It's all right.
312	00:14:56	00:14:57	Is that her?
313	00:15:03	00:15:07	Yeah, yeah, sh-she was there, but...
314	00:15:07	00:15:10	th-th-there was somebody else, another girl.
315	00:15:10	00:15:11	Who?
316	00:15:11	00:15:13	I can see her, she...
317	00:15:14	00:15:16	She was beautiful.
318	00:15:16	00:15:19	You, uh, you had this pendant in your pocket.
319	00:15:19	00:15:20	You were carrying it around.
320	00:15:20	00:15:22	It must be important.
321	00:15:22	00:15:24	Think it was hers?
322	00:15:27	00:15:28	Vicky.
323	00:15:28	00:15:29	Vicky?
324	00:15:29	00:15:30	Her name's Vicky? Yeah.
325	00:15:30	00:15:32	All right, all right, that's good.
326	00:15:32	00:15:35	That's going to help us out.
327	00:15:35	00:15:37	Listen, Wes...
328	00:15:37	00:15:41	you and I are going to figure this out together.
329	00:15:41	00:15:45	We're gonna find Vicky and we're gonna find out who did this to you.
330	00:15:45	00:15:47	I promise.
331	00:16:20	00:16:23	Hey, ran ballistics on the bullet that was pulled out of Wes Clyborn's stomach.
332	00:16:23	00:16:28	It matches a round fired at a liquor store robbery four weeks ago.
333	00:16:28	00:16:30	Perp's still out there along with the gun.
334	00:16:30	00:16:33	Huh. Liquor store robbery would match Juan Perez's M.O.
335	00:16:33	00:16:39	And grabbing up two rich kids at gunpoint fits with what Nick has gotten from Wes Clyborn up to this point.
336	00:16:39	00:16:42	So does Henry's DNA report.
337	00:16:42	00:16:45	The bullet had Wes Clyborn's DNA.
338	00:16:45	00:16:49	Well, that makes sense. It also had tissue that belongs to our unknown female.
339	00:16:49	00:16:50	Well, that means...
340	00:16:53	00:16:56	...the bullet traveled through our unknown female...
341	00:16:58	00:17:00	...before landing in Wes Clyborn.
342	00:17:00	00:17:03	Clyborn says he remembers a girl named Vicky.
343	00:17:03	00:17:04	She was with him when he was shot.
344	00:17:04	00:17:05	Girlfriend maybe.
345	00:17:05	00:17:07	Through-and-through.
346	00:17:07	00:17:10	The tissue on the bullet says it wasn't a head shot.
347	00:17:10	00:17:11	She could still be alive.
348	00:17:11	00:17:12	She hasn't called for help.
349	00:17:12	00:17:14	Well, maybe she can't.
350	00:17:14	00:17:15	Maybe she's still being held.
351	00:17:15	00:17:17	Bleeding out on a floor somewhere.
352	00:17:18	00:17:19	Wes might have been the lucky one.
353	00:17:27	00:17:30	Think you're getting kind of forgetful.
354	00:17:30	00:17:33	Must be all of that Zen master living-in-the-moment stuff.
355	00:17:33	00:17:34	Yeah.
356	00:17:34	00:17:37	At least you remembered to put on socks.
357	00:17:37	00:17:39	Did you take a look at it?
358	00:17:39	00:17:41	Yes, I did.
359	00:17:41	00:17:43	It is a good one. Yeah.
360	00:17:43	00:17:46	So?
361	00:17:46	00:17:48	I want to have some ground rules.
362	00:17:48	00:17:53	Okay. All right, number one, you are not to call me Jules in front of other people.
363	00:17:53	00:17:55	It is Finn.
364	00:17:55	00:18:01	Finn. Number two, we are never going to talk about the past.
365	00:18:01	00:18:04	Sounds to me like you want to live in the moment.
366	00:18:04	00:18:08	And when that Zen crap starts, we need to have a safe word.
367	00:18:08	00:18:10	Pick one. Um...
368	00:18:10	00:18:11	Stop.
369	00:18:11	00:18:12	Would that work? You got it.
370	00:18:12	00:18:13	All right.
371	00:18:13	00:18:16	And what about you-- do you have any rules?
372	00:18:16	00:18:20	I'm gonna have to hire you on a temporary basis, uh, as a consultant.
373	00:18:20	00:18:22	I've already run that by HR.
374	00:18:22	00:18:24	Of course you have. And...
375	00:18:24	00:18:27	legally, we need to pay you a consulting fee.
376	00:18:33	00:18:38	Figured the case was so fascinating, you'd want to do it for nothing.
377	00:18:38	00:18:41	You know me so well.
378	00:18:41	00:18:44	And you know blood better than anybody I know.
379	00:18:46	00:18:50	All right, I want your best DNA person.
380	00:18:50	00:18:52	I don't want your best tech.
381	00:18:52	00:18:53	I want your best mind.
382	00:18:53	00:18:54	You got it.
383	00:18:54	00:18:56	You got me.
384	00:19:00	00:19:02	Wow.
385	00:19:02	00:19:04	The case file did not do this justice.
386	00:19:04	00:19:06	Sanders, right?
387	00:19:06	00:19:07	Uh, Greg.
388	00:19:07	00:19:09	Finn.
389	00:19:09	00:19:18	You know, I get the whole E.R. urgency over evidence thing, but did you cut out all these samples? No.
390	00:19:18	00:19:20	But if I were still working DNA, I would have.
391	00:19:20	00:19:21	No, no, no, it's not you.
392	00:19:21	00:19:29	I get it, DNA is king these days, but people don't understand that blood spatter can often tell you more than any test tube.
393	00:19:29	00:19:31	Russell says you're the man.
394	00:19:31	00:19:32	Oh, did he? Mm-hmm.
395	00:19:32	00:19:37	Hmm, I try my best.
396	00:19:37	00:19:42	God, I hope somebody got some pictures before the DNA moths got to this.
397	00:19:44	00:19:45	Great.
398	00:19:46	00:19:47	We're not totally screwed.
399	00:19:47	00:19:50	Yeah, we're pretty good about using cameras around here.
400	00:19:52	00:20:00	Okay, we're going to reconstruct all the blood events on these clothes and we're gonna map every inch by DNA contributor.
401	00:20:00	00:20:02	I have the DNA reports right here.
402	00:20:02	00:20:03	Oh, good.
403	00:20:03	00:20:05	Oh, do you have a dummy?
404	00:20:43	00:20:45	Wow, you truly are the Blood Whisperer.
405	00:20:45	00:20:47	Stop.
406	00:20:47	00:20:51	Okay, so we've got five blood events.
407	00:20:51	00:20:53	My logic suggests a certain order.
408	00:20:53	00:20:54	Okay, let it bleed.
409	00:20:54	00:21:01	All right, so your victim remembers a struggle with Juan Perez.
410	00:21:01	00:21:03	Here is Juan's blood on Wes's shirt.
411	00:21:03	00:21:08	Pattern indicates blunt force trauma, close quarters combat.
412	00:21:08	00:21:12	But I don't think that Juan was the only one in there fighting.
413	00:21:12	00:21:13	Elena Perez.
414	00:21:13	00:21:18	So... brother and sister were both mixing it up with Wes.
415	00:21:18	00:21:27	Both getting their blood on him, and then, according to Wes, Juan goes ballistic-- literally-- firing a bullet...
416	00:21:27	00:21:30	through our unknown female and into Wes.
417	00:21:30	00:21:32	Okay, so that could be girlfriend Vicky.
418	00:21:32	00:21:34	Could be.
419	00:21:34	00:21:36	Here's her HV spatter from the through-and-through.
420	00:21:36	00:21:41	Of course, nothing says fight over like a good shot to the head.
421	00:21:44	00:21:52	And so do the gravitational drops from Wes's head shot, leaving the final blood-soaked area from the abdominal gunshot wound.
422	00:21:54	00:21:55	Nice job.
423	00:21:55	00:21:56	Thank you.
424	00:21:56	00:21:57	So...
425	00:21:57	00:22:02	our kid wrestles with two assailants, gets shot twice.
426	00:22:02	00:22:05	But how the hell did he get out of there?
427	00:22:05	00:22:07	Maybe he was left for dead.
428	00:22:07	00:22:11	Well, that does not bode well for Vicky.
429	00:22:11	00:22:12	Hey, hey. Hey.
430	00:22:12	00:22:13	I talked to Juan Perez's PO.
431	00:22:13	00:22:15	He hasn't heard from Juan in a week.
432	00:22:15	00:22:17	No current address and no job on file. (growls)
433	00:22:17	00:22:19	On the bright side, I think I found Vicky.
434	00:22:19	00:22:21	Really?
435	00:22:21	00:22:22	How'd you do that so fast?
436	00:22:22	00:22:24	I just did a web search, man.
437	00:22:24	00:22:26	I punched in Vickys with a connection to Wes Clyborn.
438	00:22:26	00:22:28	Of course.
439	00:22:28	00:22:31	I think I got a lot more than I bargained for.
440	00:22:34	00:22:37	A newsletter from Jonah Clyborn's financial firm?
441	00:22:37	00:22:38	Take a look at the Christmas candids.
442	00:22:42	00:22:43	Vicky Sheldon?
443	00:22:43	00:22:46	Former assistant to Jonah Clyborn, filed for unemployment two months ago.
444	00:22:46	00:22:50	It looks like she's holding onto the boss pretty tight before he let her go.
445	00:22:50	00:22:52	Yeah, maybe because she found another Clyborn to hang onto.
446	00:22:52	00:22:55	What do you mean?
447	00:22:55	00:22:57	I went by Vicky Sheldon's place; she wasn't there.
448	00:22:57	00:23:03	Landlord said that he hasn't seen her the past 24 hours, but he has seen plenty of Wes Clyborn the last few months.
449	00:23:03	00:23:09	Well, maybe this Juan Perez dude graduated from carjacking to hit man.
450	00:23:09	00:23:12	And maybe my next search turns up a connection between him and the dad.
451	00:23:12	00:23:18	You really think the old man would put out a hit on his own son? Hey, over a woman?
452	00:23:18	00:23:22	Anything's possible, I guess. Look, you said it yourself, right?
453	00:23:22	00:23:24	This guy isn't exactly Mr. Warmth.
454	00:23:24	00:23:27	No.
455	00:23:27	00:23:29	No, he's not.
456	00:23:35	00:23:36	Mr. Clyborn?
457	00:23:36	00:23:39	Thank you for coming down.
458	00:23:39	00:23:45	I know you've already spoken to my colleagues at the hospital, but I just have a few more questions for you.
459	00:23:45	00:23:47	What about?
460	00:23:47	00:23:49	Vicky Sheldon.
461	00:23:49	00:23:54	She worked for you as your personal assistant for over a year.
462	00:23:54	00:23:56	That is, right up until...
463	00:23:56	00:23:58	two weeks ago, when she was fired.
464	00:23:58	00:24:00	Vicky was one of several personal assistants.
465	00:24:00	00:24:03	Yeah, but probably the only one who's dating your son.
466	00:24:03	00:24:04	Am I right?
467	00:24:04	00:24:05	News to me.
468	00:24:05	00:24:09	So, that wasn't the reason why she got her pink slip?
469	00:24:09	00:24:10	And...
470	00:24:10	00:24:12	how long have you known about the relationship?
471	00:24:12	00:24:15	Wes told me about it a month ago.
472	00:24:15	00:24:17	Do you approve?
473	00:24:17	00:24:18	Wes is an adult.
474	00:24:18	00:24:20	He makes his own decisions.
475	00:24:20	00:24:22	That wasn't a yes.
476	00:24:22	00:24:25	Honestly, I think she was using my son.
477	00:24:25	00:24:33	How's that? While Vicky was employed by my husband, I learned that Wes was supplementing her wages with checks drawn from Jonah's business account.
478	00:24:33	00:24:35	I told Jonah to fire her.
479	00:24:35	00:24:40	Mrs. Clyborn, are you sure that Wes was the one that was paying her bills?
480	00:24:40	00:24:42	What exactly are you suggesting?
481	00:24:42	00:24:43	Okay, let's see.
482	00:24:43	00:24:47	Three days ago, a car crashed into the wall outside of Vicky Sheldon's home.
483	00:24:47	00:24:49	Just barely missed going through her picture window.
484	00:24:49	00:24:50	So? So...
485	00:24:50	00:24:54	by the time the police arrived, both the car and the driver were gone.
486	00:24:54	00:24:58	And Vicky didn't want to talk about it, and nobody saw anything but the car.
487	00:24:58	00:25:03	Not many fender-busted Bentleys get sold for scrap around here.
488	00:25:03	00:25:07	Oh, yeah, and, um, car's registered in your name.
489	00:25:07	00:25:10	I wasn't driving it.
490	00:25:10	00:25:14	Wes told me he hit a fire hydrant.
491	00:25:14	00:25:15	Well, that's got to be a little infuriating.
492	00:25:15	00:25:17	More engine than he could handle.
493	00:25:17	00:25:20	No, I mean, kid lives at home, spends your money, wrecks your car.
494	00:25:20	00:25:24	Late at night, outside the home of your ex... assistant.
495	00:25:24	00:25:27	That's got to grind at you.
496	00:25:27	00:25:30	I know you aren't accusing me of something.
497	00:25:30	00:25:34	If Wes wanted to go slumming with the help, that was his prerogative.
498	00:25:34	00:25:37	Kid didn't deserve to get killed over it.
499	00:25:37	00:25:39	But that's on him.
500	00:25:39	00:25:41	Not me.
501	00:25:49	00:25:50	Ah.
502	00:25:50	00:25:52	New lab coats.
503	00:25:52	00:25:55	Although, I ordered periwinkle, not royal blue.
504	00:25:55	00:25:57	They're not for you.
505	00:25:57	00:26:00	This work smock is from the trunk of Elena Perez's car.
506	00:26:00	00:26:04	And this one, I just found searching Vicky Sheldon's apartment.
507	00:26:04	00:26:06	Vicky and Elena worked together?
508	00:26:06	00:26:08	Identical smocks.
509	00:26:08	00:26:09	And they definitely know each other.
510	00:26:09	00:26:12	I found Elena's number written on a note in Vicky's place.
511	00:26:12	00:26:14	Working with a lady who's living in her car.
512	00:26:14	00:26:17	That's a doozy of a drop from Vicky's previous job.
513	00:26:17	00:26:20	So maybe Vicky wanted to cushion the fall with some Clyborn money.
514	00:26:20	00:26:25	Got Juan and Elena to help her rob Wes, the rip-off went bad, and Wes escaped?
515	00:26:25	00:26:27	Laverne and Shirley go femme fatale.
516	00:26:27	00:26:30	Love it. And I would love to know where those smocks were employed.
517	00:26:30	00:26:32	Can you please check them for trace?
518	00:26:32	00:26:35	Any answer could help us find our primary.
519	00:26:41	00:26:43	Hey. Hey.
520	00:26:43	00:26:47	Finally got cell phone records for Wes, Juan and Elena last night.
521	00:26:47	00:26:50	Last calls were made at the same time in the same vicinity.
522	00:26:50	00:26:52	Got the cell phone towers.
523	00:26:52	00:26:54	Let's see where the coverage overlaps.
524	00:26:54	00:26:57	Overlap places all three callers...
525	00:26:57	00:26:58	(beeping) Here.
526	00:26:58	00:27:01	Arroyo Horizons Business Park.
527	00:27:01	00:27:03	Why would they all be there on a Saturday night?
528	00:27:07	00:27:08	LVPD.
529	00:27:15	00:27:19	Site manager said this was the only facility that wasn't locked down.
530	00:27:24	00:27:26	Got blood.
531	00:27:26	00:27:28	Shoe impression.
532	00:27:28	00:27:30	Yep.
533	00:27:30	00:27:32	Looks like it's coming from back there.
534	00:27:54	00:27:55	Vicky Sheldon.
535	00:27:58	00:27:59	Body's cold.
536	00:27:59	00:28:00	She's been here for a while.
537	00:28:00	00:28:02	Same story here.
538	00:28:07	00:28:08	Elena Perez?
539	00:28:08	00:28:12	It's hard to tell from what's left of her face.
540	00:28:20	00:28:23	What the hell happened in here?
541	00:28:23	00:28:26	Well, it's not like Wes Clyborn can really help us out right now.
542	00:28:26	00:28:27	No, but I know who can.
543	00:28:27	00:28:30	Yeah, the only guy we know who walked out of here.
544	00:28:30	00:28:31	Juan Perez.
545	00:28:31	00:28:32	He's got a lot to answer for.
546	00:28:39	00:28:42	Fabulous Las Vegas.
547	00:28:42	00:28:44	Not so fabulous for her.
548	00:28:44	00:28:47	Elena Perez's car said she was down on her luck.
549	00:28:47	00:28:50	Looks like her luck ran out.
550	00:28:50	00:28:52	Still in full rigor.
551	00:28:52	00:28:55	T.O.D. is approximately 18 to 24 hours ago.
552	00:28:55	00:28:58	Same time frame as this poor girl.
553	00:28:58	00:29:01	Vicky Sheldon, GSW through and through.
554	00:29:01	00:29:03	There's quite a blood pool here.
555	00:29:03	00:29:06	Bullet probably severed her left hepatic artery.
556	00:29:06	00:29:10	Well, if that's the case, she lost consciousness and then bled out rather quickly.
557	00:29:10	00:29:12	Got off easy compared to her friend.
558	00:29:12	00:29:14	Massive blunt force trauma.
559	00:29:14	00:29:17	Nearly every bone in her face is smashed.
560	00:29:17	00:29:18	Overkill.
561	00:29:18	00:29:19	Rage.
562	00:29:19	00:29:22	The wounds show a distinctive pattern.
563	00:29:22	00:29:24	Could be brass knuckles maybe. Maybe.
564	00:29:24	00:29:27	But how do you explain the punctures?
565	00:29:29	00:29:31	I might be able to answer that question.
566	00:29:31	00:29:35	Brass knuckles included.
567	00:29:35	00:29:37	Could have a partial palm print here.
568	00:29:37	00:29:41	Looks like what happened in Las Vegas kind of stayed on Las Vegas.
569	00:29:44	00:29:50	Well, I see your palm print, and I raise you a knee impression and a footprint.
570	00:29:50	00:29:52	What kind of shoes was Wes Clyborn wearing?
571	00:29:52	00:29:54	Uh, dress shoes.
572	00:29:54	00:29:55	Why? These aren't dress shoes.
573	00:29:55	00:29:57	They're work boots.
574	00:29:57	00:30:01	And they look like they are hauling ass out of here.
575	00:30:01	00:30:03	Right out the back door.
576	00:30:14	00:30:17	Work boots weren't the only thing hauling ass.
577	00:30:17	00:30:20	Mm-hmm.
578	00:30:20	00:30:23	Tire treads and boot prints.
579	00:30:23	00:30:25	Got some paint.
580	00:30:25	00:30:27	Could be transfer.
581	00:30:30	00:30:32	It looks like we've got some trace here.
582	00:30:38	00:30:40	White and crusty.
583	00:30:43	00:30:47	Not much different than what's in your fridge.
584	00:30:47	00:30:49	Sodium bicarbonate.
585	00:30:49	00:30:52	Trace from the boot print is baking soda?
586	00:30:52	00:30:55	Specifically, the chemical formulation used in industrial cleaning supplies.
587	00:30:55	00:30:57	Still pretty generic.
588	00:30:57	00:30:58	Doesn't get us any closer to tracking Juan.
589	00:30:58	00:31:04	Well, if you want unique, I've got just your color.
590	00:31:04	00:31:06	Royal crimson metallic.
591	00:31:06	00:31:09	Auto paint transfer from the loading bay at the crime scene.
592	00:31:09	00:31:14	Used exclusively on one vehicle model, Austin Healy B-100.
593	00:31:14	00:31:16	From 1955 to 1957.
594	00:31:16	00:31:18	That's a hell of a nice car.
595	00:31:18	00:31:20	I don't see Juan Perez owning it.
596	00:31:20	00:31:23	Maybe he was working on it.
597	00:31:23	00:31:25	Soda blasting.
598	00:31:25	00:31:28	Sodium bicarbonate applied through compressed air.
599	00:31:28	00:31:33	Used by auto-detailing places to prep a car that's about to be repainted.
600	00:31:33	00:31:34	Perhaps with royal crimson metallic.
601	00:31:34	00:31:37	Maybe Juan borrowed the car.
602	00:31:37	00:31:43	If you owned a classic ride like a '56 Austin Healy, I doubt you'd take it to the corner body shop. No.
603	00:31:43	00:31:47	I'd go to the best to pimp my ride.
604	00:31:54	00:31:55	That guy there.
605	00:31:58	00:32:00	Juan Perez?
606	00:32:02	00:32:03	LVPD.
607	00:32:03	00:32:07	Your parole officer's been looking for you.
608	00:32:07	00:32:08	So have we.
609	00:32:11	00:32:13	I guess you found me.
610	00:32:13	00:32:14	Hmm?
611	00:32:25	00:32:26	Oh.
612	00:32:26	00:32:28	Ooh. That had to hurt.
613	00:32:29	00:32:31	Maybe you can fix that dent before we take you downtown.
614	00:33:51	00:33:52	What took you so long?
615	00:33:52	00:33:54	I've been busy today.
616	00:33:54	00:33:56	We recovered Juan Perez's gun.
617	00:33:56	00:33:57	We're running it.
618	00:33:57	00:34:00	Well, I can tell you right now that Juan fired that gun.
619	00:34:00	00:34:03	All right.
620	00:34:03	00:34:07	Blood pools from Wes Clyborn's two gunshot wounds.
621	00:34:07	00:34:10	He was shot standing, falls.
622	00:34:10	00:34:13	Bleeds from the head and the gut.
623	00:34:13	00:34:16	And over here, HV spatter, another blood pool.
624	00:34:16	00:34:20	Which comes from Vicky Sheldon's GSW, the through-and-through, which ends up in Wes.
625	00:34:20	00:34:23	Okay, so, bang, bang.
626	00:34:23	00:34:25	Two gunshot victims.
627	00:34:25	00:34:27	Efficient, expedient.
628	00:34:27	00:34:31	Nothing in common... with this.
629	00:34:31	00:34:34	The beating of Elena Perez. Yeah.
630	00:34:34	00:34:36	Look at all of that blood.
631	00:34:36	00:34:38	Not efficient.
632	00:34:38	00:34:39	Not expedient.
633	00:34:39	00:34:45	No. I calculated roughly ten to 12 blows to the head with the murder weapon.
634	00:34:45	00:34:50	And then this knee impression. At first, I thought that it was the killer.
635	00:34:50	00:34:54	But the void from the castoff and spatter is actually on the other side of her.
636	00:34:54	00:34:59	So, the killer was on this side, which means that the knee impression was not from the killer.
637	00:34:59	00:35:02	It was from somebody who came after the beating.
638	00:35:02	00:35:04	Maybe somebody who wanted to help.
639	00:35:04	00:35:05	Somebody like a brother.
640	00:35:05	00:35:09	Where are you going with this?
641	00:35:09	00:35:12	Juan may have pulled the trigger, but I don't think he was the trigger.
642	00:35:12	00:35:14	It's a little Zen.
643	00:35:14	00:35:22	Okay, so, our current assumption is that Juan Perez held Wes Clyborn here at gunpoint, right?
644	00:35:22	00:35:23	Right. All right.
645	00:35:23	00:35:24	So, let me ask you a question.
646	00:35:24	00:35:29	You're an ex-con with a gun at my back.
647	00:35:29	00:35:34	Okay. And you are ready to use it.
648	00:35:34	00:35:36	Oh! (chuckles)
649	00:35:36	00:35:37	Where's my safe word?
650	00:35:37	00:35:38	You don't need one.
651	00:35:38	00:35:41	You have a gun... and I don't.
652	00:35:41	00:35:50	And all of this blood says that I managed to punch you in the face, not once, but over half a dozen times.
653	00:35:52	00:35:57	A rich kid takes down an ex-con with a gun?
654	00:35:57	00:35:58	How does that happen?
655	00:35:58	00:36:02	It doesn't.
656	00:36:02	00:36:05	You make a good case.
657	00:36:05	00:36:08	Juan Perez's blood makes the case.
658	00:36:09	00:36:16	He may have walked out with that gun, but I don't think he brought it.
659	00:36:16	00:36:20	Doesn't look good, Juan.
660	00:36:20	00:36:24	Career criminal running from the cops, gun with your prints found in your work locker.
661	00:36:24	00:36:25	So why all the talk?
662	00:36:25	00:36:29	I mean, you got me, and you got the gun.
663	00:36:29	00:36:34	And ballistics confirms that you used it against Wes Clyborn and Vicky Sheldon.
664	00:36:34	00:36:36	If you don't mind, I have one question.
665	00:36:36	00:36:40	Am I going to give it up, right?
666	00:36:40	00:36:46	Why else you think I'm sitting here without some half-asleep, court-appointed, public pretender sitting next to me?
667	00:36:46	00:36:48	That wasn't my question.
668	00:36:48	00:36:54	We have your sister Elena's cell phone records that shows that she called you the night of the murders.
669	00:36:54	00:36:56	My question is, why?
670	00:36:56	00:36:58	Why do you think?
671	00:36:58	00:37:09	I think she needed you because she was scared for herself and her friend Vicky, whose ex had been calling her all night long.
672	00:37:09	00:37:16	He tried to ram his car through her apartment a couple of days before that, but now he had a bigger head of steam going.
673	00:37:16	00:37:19	He wanted what was his...
674	00:37:19	00:37:21	and he came for it.
675	00:37:24	00:37:26	Vicky... It's over!
676	00:37:29	00:37:30	You got that part right.
677	00:37:30	00:37:32	Hey!
678	00:37:32	00:37:34	What's going on?
679	00:37:34	00:37:36	How am I doing so far?
680	00:37:36	00:37:38	You were just trying to protect your sister.
681	00:37:38	00:37:43	You just didn't count on the rich boy having brought a street gun to the party.
682	00:37:57	00:38:02	You came to, you saw Wes beating your sister, and you had to stop him.
683	00:38:02	00:38:04	You had to protect the family.
684	00:38:04	00:38:05	Get off her!
685	00:38:05	00:38:09	Juan, put the gun down, please!
686	00:38:16	00:38:17	You had no other choice.
687	00:38:21	00:38:23	Your sister was already dead.
688	00:38:23	00:38:27	You knew how things would look, so you ran.
689	00:38:39	00:38:42	This is your lucky day.
690	00:38:42	00:38:45	There's the pen, and there's the paper.
691	00:38:45	00:38:47	Write it down.
692	00:38:56	00:38:58	Yeah, I was always the troublemaker.
693	00:38:58	00:39:02	Life wasn't fair, so I made it fair.
694	00:39:06	00:39:10	But Elena never complained.
695	00:39:10	00:39:13	Elena worked hard.
696	00:39:13	00:39:14	Elena had faith.
697	00:39:14	00:39:23	And the one time that she needed me-- someone like me...
698	00:39:23	00:39:25	...I failed her.
699	00:39:34	00:39:36	How the hell do you know what went on in that room?
700	00:39:36	00:39:39	I have a very smart friend.
701	00:39:41	00:39:44	She's your friend, too.
702	00:39:58	00:40:01	Give us a minute, will you?
703	00:40:04	00:40:08	Tried to take my hallway walk.
704	00:40:08	00:40:10	Cops wouldn't let me leave.
705	00:40:13	00:40:16	I'm not going home...
706	00:40:16	00:40:17	am I?
707	00:40:17	00:40:19	No.
708	00:40:19	00:40:22	Did I hurt Vicky?
709	00:40:22	00:40:26	You hurt 'em all, Wes.
710	00:40:26	00:40:30	Two people are dead because of you.
711	00:40:30	00:40:32	I remembered something this morning.
712	00:40:34	00:40:36	I loved her.
713	00:40:37	00:40:39	I know I did.
714	00:40:39	00:40:43	The person you say did this...
715	00:40:46	00:40:48	...I don't even know him.
716	00:40:51	00:40:53	Neither do I, man.
717	00:41:08	00:41:10	That was very nicely done.
718	00:41:10	00:41:12	You did all the work.
719	00:41:12	00:41:14	I did, didn't I?
720	00:41:14	00:41:16	And here's your...
721	00:41:16	00:41:19	dollar back.
722	00:41:19	00:41:22	Like you said, I'm not really in it for the money.
723	00:41:22	00:41:25	Don't you ever miss it?
724	00:41:25	00:41:28	I mean, you've been out of the game now, how long?
725	00:41:28	00:41:29	You know how long.
726	00:41:29	00:41:31	You want back in?
727	00:41:31	00:41:33	You asking? Oh, come on.
728	00:41:33	00:41:35	Don't make me beg.
729	00:41:35	00:41:37	I like it when you beg.
730	00:41:37	00:41:40	I have my own envelope.
731	00:41:40	00:41:42	My expenses.
732	00:41:42	00:41:45	Party table rental, two smocks, some paints.
733	00:41:45	00:41:46	It's all in there.
734	00:41:46	00:41:48	Come on. What do you think?
735	00:41:48	00:41:50	(sighs) I don't know.
736	00:41:50	00:41:51	I really don't know.
737	00:41:51	00:41:53	Okay.
738	00:41:53	00:41:55	I will think about it.
739	00:42:01	00:42:03	I may call you.
740	00:42:03	00:42:05	I may answer.
741	00:42:08	00:42:09	Wait. Whoa.
742	00:42:09	00:42:11	Whoa-ho!
743	00:42:11	00:42:14	Nobody calls me Diebenkorn around here.
744	00:42:14	00:42:15	It's D.B.
