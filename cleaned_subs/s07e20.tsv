0	00:00:10	00:00:13	Fellas, another incident at Lolita's.
1	00:00:13	00:00:14	What now?
2	00:00:14	00:00:17	An erotic athlete claiming a 420-Z.
3	00:00:17	00:00:19	The paramedics have her on a stretcher.
4	00:00:19	00:00:22	What the hell's an erotic athlete?
5	00:00:22	00:00:24	Well, I hope it's a tight end in a G-string.
6	00:00:24	00:00:26	Nice. (laughs)
7	00:00:28	00:00:29	Greg? Yeah.
8	00:00:29	00:00:32	419 at Tagliferri's restaurant on 8th Avenue.
9	00:00:32	00:00:33	All right.
10	00:00:33	00:00:35	Thanks. I'm on it.
11	00:00:35	00:00:36	Cath? Huh?
12	00:00:36	00:00:38	415-B at the HaHaHa.
13	00:00:39	00:00:41	What's the weapon?
14	00:00:41	00:00:42	A Taser? Come on!
15	00:00:42	00:00:47	An angry clown got pissed at some heckler with clogged arteries, and it caused a heart attack.
16	00:00:47	00:00:52	So, Greg-O gets a hit at a mob restaurant, and I get a clown who can't take a joke?
17	00:00:52	00:00:54	Trust me, you don't want Greg's 419.
18	00:00:54	00:00:56	Hey. Hey.
19	00:00:56	00:00:57	Hey.
20	00:00:57	00:01:01	CDC needs someone out at the Omdi-Tech offices on Boulder Highway.
21	00:01:01	00:01:04	I'm sure it's not hazardous, or they wouldn't let us collect it.
22	00:01:04	00:01:06	Okay. You coming with?
23	00:01:06	00:01:09	No, I'm spending the night in autopsy with the Lake Mead floater.
24	00:01:09	00:01:10	Well, enjoy.
25	00:01:10	00:01:12	That guy was putrid.
26	00:01:12	00:01:13	Oh, by the way...
27	00:02:01	00:02:11	Four crime scene miniatures, four murder victims, and one diabolical killer with an obsessive streak who still remains at large.
28	00:02:14	00:02:20	I don't know if any of you have noticed how distracted Grissom's been lately, but it's these.
29	00:02:20	00:02:22	Keeping him up at night.
30	00:02:24	00:02:26	You know the combination?
31	00:02:26	00:02:27	Of course.
32	00:02:27	00:02:32	Grissom could use some fresh eyes on the case, and that's why I've asked you here.
33	00:02:32	00:02:39	Obviously, this could be perceived as insulting to the CSIs who formerly worked the case, so secrecy is of the utmost importance.
34	00:02:39	00:02:40	Double down low.
35	00:02:42	00:02:43	it's Moneypenny.
36	00:02:43	00:02:44	M needs you back at HQ.
37	00:02:45	00:02:46	Shoe phone was Get Smart, though.
38	00:02:46	00:02:47	Oh, that's right.
39	00:02:47	00:02:49	99 was so hot. Mm.
40	00:02:49	00:02:52	Four people are dead, the killer is still out there, and you're mocking?
41	00:02:52	00:02:54	We're mocking you.
42	00:02:54	00:02:56	Ah. You in or out?
43	00:02:56	00:02:58	I don't really know anything about these cases.
44	00:02:58	00:02:59	We'll review.
45	00:02:59	00:03:01	I don't know. I have a lot of work to do.
46	00:03:01	00:03:07	And by work, you mean IM'ing your Icelandic pen pal who thinks that you look like Warrick Brown because that's the picture you posted.
47	00:03:07	00:03:08	How...?
48	00:03:08	00:03:09	I just know.
49	00:03:09	00:03:12	Archie, in?
50	00:03:12	00:03:14	What the hell, but I got to leave early.
51	00:03:14	00:03:18	I got a surfing trip in Santa Barbara this weekend. Miss Mockery?
52	00:03:18	00:03:21	Well, we can't leave the lab, we can't talk to suspects.
53	00:03:21	00:03:25	What exactly does Grissom wants us to do? It's not always what you look at that matters, it's what you see.
54	00:03:25	00:03:27	That's Thoreau.
55	00:03:27	00:03:28	Oh, is it? Hmm.
56	00:03:28	00:03:30	Okay, Professor.
57	00:03:30	00:03:32	And your point would be?
58	00:03:33	00:03:36	The answers lie in these.
59	00:03:40	00:03:42	We're lab techs.
60	00:03:42	00:03:43	We think differently than field guys.
61	00:03:43	00:03:46	They deal with people, we deal with things.
62	00:03:46	00:03:52	Maybe we can't find the killer, but I think we can find the thing that links all four murders.
63	00:03:53	00:03:56	This is an opportunity.
64	00:03:56	00:03:59	We have one shift to show Grissom what we're made of.
65	00:03:59	00:04:01	Tonight, we could be heroes.
66	00:04:02	00:04:04	All right, all right.
67	00:04:04	00:04:05	I'm in.
68	00:04:10	00:04:12	It's time to think outside the box.
69	00:05:43	00:05:47	The first miniature was found at the crime scene seven months ago.
70	00:05:47	00:05:50	The victim is Izzy Delancy, washed-up rock star.
71	00:05:50	00:05:52	Blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
72	00:05:52	00:05:57	Bonked with a rolling pin, found in the drawer at the scene. Stalker maybe?
73	00:05:57	00:06:00	Izzy didn't have any known stalkers, and there was no forced entry.
74	00:06:00	00:06:06	Suspects include his first wife, his current wife, the nanny he was schtuping and his teenage son.
75	00:06:06	00:06:08	Motive thought to be sex?
76	00:06:08	00:06:09	And-or money.
77	00:06:09	00:06:11	Izzy's music library was for sale.
78	00:06:11	00:06:12	Mucho dinero to be gained.
79	00:06:12	00:06:13	So? So...
80	00:06:13	00:06:15	nothing.
81	00:06:15	00:06:17	Every suspect was exonerated.
82	00:06:17	00:06:20	All we were left with was this...
83	00:06:20	00:06:24	A perfect, half-inch scale model of the room.
84	00:06:24	00:06:27	And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature...
85	00:06:27	00:06:33	It would have taken weeks, maybe even months to create with this kind of detail.
86	00:06:33	00:06:36	It certainly qualifies as premeditation.
87	00:06:46	00:06:48	It's real blood.
88	00:06:48	00:06:52	The killer actually stuck around to match the blood pool at the scene.
89	00:06:52	00:06:54	Ah, ah, ah, ah!
90	00:06:54	00:06:56	What?
91	00:06:56	00:06:57	What are you doing?
92	00:06:57	00:06:58	Sitting.
93	00:06:58	00:07:00	No, no. You're tempting fate.
94	00:07:00	00:07:07	You know how you should never try on someone else's engagement ring, hold the Oscar, use the excuse that your grandmother died when she didn't...
95	00:07:07	00:07:10	I tried on Suzie Quinceworthy's diamond ring last year.
96	00:07:10	00:07:12	It looked really good on her, and looked terrible on me.
97	00:07:12	00:07:15	I don't think an emerald cut flatters my little ten-ies.
98	00:07:15	00:07:17	Will I never marry? I'll marry you.
99	00:07:17	00:07:19	Although, you know, my grandmother's still alive.
100	00:07:19	00:07:20	She lives down in Boca.
101	00:07:20	00:07:25	I don't know if you know this, but I am the shuffleboard champion of the Boca Surf and Sand. Mm.
102	00:07:25	00:07:27	Lady killer of the senior set.
103	00:07:27	00:07:29	Rock on. I can do an open marriage.
104	00:07:29	00:07:30	Why do you guys keep doing that?
105	00:07:30	00:07:31	Do what?
106	00:07:31	00:07:33	Hodges, relax, man.
107	00:07:33	00:07:35	I don't want to run the lab.
108	00:07:35	00:07:37	We are guests in the man's office.
109	00:07:37	00:07:41	If there was one person who was more respectful of space and boundaries, it's Grissom.
110	00:07:41	00:07:44	You could at least offer him the same courtesy.
111	00:07:47	00:07:48	Wait.
112	00:07:48	00:07:50	Is he okay with us being in here?
113	00:07:50	00:07:52	He said he'd be in Autopsy, won't be back for hours.
114	00:07:53	00:07:56	Anyway, they never solved Izzy Delancy's murder.
115	00:07:57	00:08:00	Two months later, Penny Garden was found dead in her house.
116	00:08:54	00:09:01	Suspects included her ex-junkie nephew who was living with her, and her drug-dealing neighbor, who was buying prescription meds from her.
117	00:09:01	00:09:03	Obvious motives-- drugs and money.
118	00:09:03	00:09:05	Did either of them have any connection to Izzy Delancy?
119	00:09:05	00:09:06	No.
120	00:09:06	00:09:11	CSIs didn't even realize this was a Miniature case until this was anonymously delivered to the scene the next day.
121	00:09:12	00:09:14	And why wasn't it left with the body like the other one?
122	00:09:14	00:09:16	Good question.
123	00:09:16	00:09:18	Grissom and I really noodled over that one.
124	00:09:18	00:09:24	Look carefully at the back of the doll, and at the pillow on the chair.
125	00:09:24	00:09:28	There appears to be remnants of glue on both.
126	00:09:28	00:09:33	So the doll was originally glued to the back of the chair.
127	00:09:36	00:09:41	I think the killer expected the victim to die in this chair.
128	00:09:56	00:10:02	Well, if that's the case, then how did the killer expect to... kill her?
129	00:10:08	00:10:14	The killer knew that Penny was always stinko on Cherry Herring by coupon-clipping time, so...
130	00:10:14	00:10:19	He laced her booze with liquid nicotine, which induced convulsions.
131	00:10:21	00:10:24	And when she went all twitchy and through the window...
132	00:10:26	00:10:30	The OCD killer had to match it with his mini, which is why it showed up late.
133	00:10:31	00:10:32	Red dog barks at midnight.
134	00:10:34	00:10:36	What are you guys doing in here?
135	00:10:36	00:10:39	Nothing. Yeah.
136	00:10:46	00:10:53	All right, freakboy, your phone has been ringing off the hook, so I finally answered it, and Warrick and Nick said they have a ton of trace, and they really need you to clear the decks.
137	00:10:53	00:10:55	No problem.
138	00:10:56	00:10:58	After you.
139	00:10:58	00:10:59	After you.
140	00:11:13	00:11:16	Hmm. Irides brown.
141	00:11:16	00:11:21	No apparent puncture wounds, abrasions or lacerations.
142	00:11:21	00:11:24	COD appears to be drowning.
143	00:11:24	00:11:27	We did pull him out of Lake Mead you know.
144	00:11:27	00:11:33	Right. Based on decomp, I'd put TOD around 48 hours ago.
145	00:11:37	00:11:38	Where's his head, David?
146	00:11:38	00:11:40	They haven't found it yet.
147	00:11:40	00:11:42	Day shift.
148	00:11:49	00:11:51	Uh-oh. He's got gas. Phew.
149	00:11:51	00:11:52	Yeah, he's going to be a stinker.
150	00:11:52	00:11:54	You want a mask? No, I'm all right.
151	00:12:01	00:12:04	What the hell?
152	00:12:10	00:12:12	Rat!
153	00:12:27	00:12:28	Nice work.
154	00:12:28	00:12:30	At least I tried to get him. Where were you?
155	00:12:30	00:12:31	I hate rats.
156	00:12:41	00:12:43	Wow. Don't bother being discerning.
157	00:12:43	00:12:45	Hey, what can I say?
158	00:12:45	00:12:48	Erotic athletes are kind of gratuitous with the hands.
159	00:12:48	00:12:52	And lube on latex leaves excellent ridge detail.
160	00:12:52	00:12:54	What's with the, uh, blast from the past?
161	00:12:54	00:12:56	You got new evidence on the miniatures?
162	00:12:56	00:12:57	Um, just refiling some stuff.
163	00:12:58	00:12:59	Uh, G-on-G action.
164	00:12:59	00:13:02	It's not really a big question as to who did it, is it?
165	00:13:02	00:13:04	One ring, six women.
166	00:13:04	00:13:09	Ursula Major claims Ursula Minor was responsible for the pile drive.
167	00:13:09	00:13:11	Only you, my dear, will know for sure.
168	00:13:11	00:13:14	Have fun.
169	00:13:19	00:13:21	Is that condensation?
170	00:13:22	00:13:25	Oh, no, it's-it's lube... I think.
171	00:13:25	00:13:29	Yeah, these bikinis are from the erotic athletes at Lolita's bar.
172	00:13:29	00:13:33	This woman, Lucy Pavorotti, broke her neck flipping around up there.
173	00:13:34	00:13:36	Well, now she's suing everybody.
174	00:13:37	00:13:38	Okay. I'm on it.
175	00:13:41	00:13:43	Nothing?
176	00:13:44	00:13:46	What?
177	00:13:46	00:13:47	Nothing at all?
178	00:13:48	00:13:52	I'm all ready for Luscious Lucy likey Lolita's lubey.
179	00:13:52	00:13:54	Or something.
180	00:13:55	00:13:56	Every man is not an end but a beginning.
181	00:13:56	00:13:59	Today I rise above and step up.
182	00:13:59	00:14:01	Have a nice day.
183	00:14:01	00:14:02	Good point.
184	00:14:03	00:14:06	Hey, I've been meaning to ask you about something you might be interested in. (cell phone buzzing)
185	00:14:06	00:14:09	The Forensic Academy has their conference in June.
186	00:14:09	00:14:10	and I'm going to be speaking on field work.
187	00:14:10	00:14:15	But the thing about it is, man, I'm just no good when it comes to IR trace technology.
188	00:14:15	00:14:18	But now you... you are. Oh.
189	00:14:18	00:14:22	So... what do you think?
190	00:14:22	00:14:24	It's in Iowa.
191	00:14:24	00:14:28	Which is... as fun as you want to make it, but...
192	00:14:28	00:14:35	So according to this, a month after Penny Garden's murder, Grissom investigated an electrocution at the Mannleigh chicken plant.
193	00:14:36	00:14:40	The victim was Raymundo Suarez, early 30s, a nighttime janitor.
194	00:14:42	00:14:51	It looked like a possible industrial accident, or maybe even a workplace homicide.
195	00:14:51	00:14:55	Right up until they found the perfect half-inch scale cast metal mini.
196	00:15:13	00:15:16	Suspects included the boss, Ike Mannleigh.
197	00:15:16	00:15:20	Raymundo was sleeping with his wife, Bubbles.
198	00:15:21	00:15:24	I can't even do it with my cat watching.
199	00:15:25	00:15:27	Wait. Sex, drugs, rock and roll.
200	00:15:27	00:15:28	Do you think it's a pattern?
201	00:15:28	00:15:32	No, 'cause according to this, sex may not have actually been the issue.
202	00:15:32	00:15:37	Yeah, Ike Mannleigh was exonerated, and another coworker, Ernie Dell, he looked good for all of the murders.
203	00:15:37	00:15:41	Yeah, that's right, he was caught on tape in an animal rights PSA made by Izzy Delancy.
204	00:15:41	00:15:43	Yes, he was.
205	00:15:44	00:15:47	Look at this.
206	00:15:49	00:15:50	Ew.
207	00:15:50	00:15:52	Yeah, tell me about it.
208	00:15:52	00:15:54	I had to scan this thing for hours.
209	00:15:54	00:15:55	Haven't been able to eat chicken since.
210	00:15:55	00:15:58	Anyway, Ernie Dell was really into model trains.
211	00:15:58	00:16:00	You know, the way a serial killer's really into pets.
212	00:16:24	00:16:31	So when CSIs went to his house, they found these molds for all these creepy little things.
213	00:16:31	00:16:35	Some of which matched pieces from the Izzy Delancy miniature.
214	00:16:52	00:16:58	Ernie was caught on some neighborhood watch surveillance video delivering the mini to Penny Garden's house.
215	00:16:58	00:16:59	This guy can't stay away from a camera.
216	00:16:59	00:17:00	You don't know how right you are.
217	00:17:00	00:17:03	He confessed on live video, e-mailed it directly to Grissom.
218	00:17:03	00:17:06	My name is Ernest Edward Dell.
219	00:17:06	00:17:11	I was born in 1946 in Ames, Iowa.
220	00:17:14	00:17:18	...spend any amount of time around people, you get your heart broke.
221	00:17:18	00:17:20	Treachery.
222	00:17:21	00:17:22	Hypocrisy.
223	00:17:22	00:17:24	The promise of love.
224	00:17:24	00:17:33	A man could kill from sunup to sunset and still his work would never be done.
225	00:17:35	00:17:37	(gunshot) Wendy?
226	00:17:38	00:17:40	Could I speak with you a moment?
227	00:17:40	00:17:41	Sure.
228	00:17:47	00:17:50	This is exactly why I didn't invite you to join us.
229	00:17:50	00:17:52	You take over everything. Uh...
230	00:17:52	00:17:55	Grissom asked me to gather some techs to review the Miniature cases.
231	00:17:55	00:17:56	Like a think tank.
232	00:17:56	00:17:57	Yeah, I know, they told me.
233	00:17:57	00:17:59	So, kudos to you.
234	00:17:59	00:18:02	I hand selected them with careful consideration to group dynamics.
235	00:18:02	00:18:03	Well, I can see that.
236	00:18:03	00:18:05	I mean, it's you and your back up singers.
237	00:18:05	00:18:06	You're Davy Hodges and the Lemmings.
238	00:18:06	00:18:07	You should take your act on the road.
239	00:18:08	00:18:10	We can hear you.
240	00:18:10	00:18:13	Look, the only reason that you don't like me is because I actually stand up to you.
241	00:18:14	00:18:15	Which, by the way, is exactly what you need.
242	00:18:15	00:18:18	You know I would be good at all this miniature stuff.
243	00:18:18	00:18:20	That's not the only reason.
244	00:18:20	00:18:23	Really? Okay, what is it?
245	00:18:23	00:18:25	You think you're too cool.
246	00:18:25	00:18:27	Oh, my God. What are we, 12?
247	00:18:27	00:18:30	I don't know, are we?
248	00:18:30	00:18:32	I don't know, are we?
249	00:18:37	00:18:39	It's just a rat, fellas.
250	00:18:39	00:18:41	Why are you wearing the HazMat gear?
251	00:18:41	00:18:42	He made me do it.
252	00:18:42	00:18:48	It's a wild animal covered with potentially biohazardous material with claws.
253	00:18:48	00:18:50	Rabies, scabies, AIDS, hepatitis.
254	00:18:50	00:18:53	I'm thinking of this suit as a giant rubber glove.
255	00:18:55	00:18:57	The vic's intestines?
256	00:18:57	00:18:59	What are you doing?
257	00:18:59	00:19:01	Rats are neophobic-- they fear the new.
258	00:19:01	00:19:07	We stand a better chance of catching him by giving him what he's used to.
259	00:19:19	00:19:23	Pestilence, alive and well.
260	00:19:32	00:19:36	I think he's onto us, Doc.
261	00:19:38	00:19:45	Miniature number four was another home, a unit in a high-rise condo, complete with a working fireplace...
262	00:19:46	00:19:50	...and a dead cat.
263	00:20:03	00:20:06	But the MO on this one was full of anomalies.
264	00:20:06	00:20:14	It was sent to the Crime Lab shortly after Ernie Dell's suicide, but before the murder had actually been committed.
265	00:20:14	00:20:20	And the really weird part was the package was addressed directly to Grissom.
266	00:20:21	00:20:23	But why, to taunt him?
267	00:20:23	00:20:24	Like suddenly it's personal?
268	00:20:24	00:20:27	The intended victim was Barbara Tallman.
269	00:20:28	00:20:29	A therapist.
270	00:20:29	00:20:30	But we got there first.
271	00:20:30	00:20:35	PD set up a sting which resulted in the death of an undercover officer, while a roomful of detectives watched.
272	00:20:35	00:20:37	Oy.
273	00:20:37	00:20:40	Again, the killer knew the habits of the victim.
274	00:20:40	00:20:43	This one always took an afternoon nap.
275	00:20:46	00:20:54	Based on her position on the couch, the CSIs thought that the intended cause of death might be suffocation or poisoning.
276	00:20:54	00:20:57	But they found something else instead.
277	00:21:05	00:21:09	Yeah, here, it looks like the killer put some kind of gizmo on the flue.
278	00:21:09	00:21:16	See, the timer went off, activated a motor which sealed the flap and dropped powdered charcoal onto the fire, producing carbon monoxide.
279	00:21:16	00:21:22	So the fumes had nowhere to go but out into the apartment and into the undercover officer.
280	00:21:25	00:21:26	Later, Betties.
281	00:21:26	00:21:28	Quitter. Glory whore.
282	00:21:30	00:21:31	Who were the suspects?
283	00:21:32	00:21:34	Somebody directly connected with Ernie.
284	00:21:34	00:21:36	Somebody worth killing himself for.
285	00:21:36	00:21:39	Maybe his son Lionel.
286	00:21:39	00:21:42	Looks like Lionel Dell knew Barbara Tallman.
287	00:21:42	00:21:45	Okay, so maybe I met her, so what?
288	00:21:45	00:21:46	So, she's dead.
289	00:21:46	00:21:50	That's four stiffs associated with you, Lionel.
290	00:21:52	00:21:55	Five, if you count Ernie.
291	00:21:55	00:21:56	I don't.
292	00:21:56	00:21:59	You know, you keep saying that you hated your dad, but I'm not buying it.
293	00:21:59	00:22:06	You go through your life alone, you're good with your hands, you have weird hobbies, you make little things.
294	00:22:06	00:22:07	And when that gets tricky...
295	00:22:09	00:22:10	...you call your father.
296	00:22:10	00:22:14	Let me tell you about Ernie.
297	00:22:14	00:22:18	What he cared about in his life was...
298	00:22:18	00:22:25	his wife, his trains, and his kids, in that order.
299	00:22:25	00:22:26	Kids?
300	00:22:26	00:22:27	You're an only child.
301	00:22:28	00:22:31	Again, if only.
302	00:22:31	00:22:36	If you're looking for a love connection, then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.
303	00:22:36	00:22:38	What are you talking about?
304	00:22:38	00:22:40	Fosters.
305	00:22:40	00:22:44	My parents had, like, dozens.
306	00:22:44	00:22:47	They'd come and go, some before I was born.
307	00:22:47	00:22:50	My mom loved kids.
308	00:22:50	00:22:52	Dad loved Mom.
309	00:22:53	00:22:57	I guess, as soon as I came around, the love ran out.
310	00:22:59	00:23:04	I had a friend who tried to reconnect with some of her old foster siblings.
311	00:23:04	00:23:05	And honestly, it's next to impossible.
312	00:23:05	00:23:10	The system protects minors, they change their names, and some of them just fall right off the map.
313	00:23:10	00:23:14	Well, the only link we have is a disposable cell phone number.
314	00:23:14	00:23:15	Calls made to all four victims?
315	00:23:15	00:23:16	Mm-hmm.
316	00:23:16	00:23:19	And additional minutes purchased on the phone with Ernie Dell's credit card after his death.
317	00:23:19	00:23:21	Yeah, online billing.
318	00:23:21	00:23:24	You can just keep spending and paying until the card expires.
319	00:23:24	00:23:25	So what happened when they called the number?
320	00:23:25	00:23:29	They did call the number, right?
321	00:23:31	00:23:33	I'm sure they did.
322	00:23:43	00:23:44	What are you doing?
323	00:23:44	00:23:46	Shh.
324	00:23:54	00:23:56	Leave a message after the tone.
325	00:24:02	00:24:03	Nice one, Simms.
326	00:24:05	00:24:07	Now they have my cell phone number.
327	00:24:13	00:24:17	Well, the victims don't have much in common, so I say we go metaphoric.
328	00:24:17	00:24:18	Hypocrisy.
329	00:24:18	00:24:20	Yeah, I get it.
330	00:24:20	00:24:28	There's Izzy the vegan eating bacon; Penny, the cigarette smoking cancer patient; Raymundo, the church-going adulterer; and Barbara, the overmedicated shrink.
331	00:24:29	00:24:31	This is the United States of America.
332	00:24:31	00:24:33	Hypocrisy is the new national anthem.
333	00:24:33	00:24:34	Forget it.
334	00:24:34	00:24:35	Stretching.
335	00:24:35	00:24:39	Grissom said they checked for commonalities between victims and got nowhere.
336	00:24:39	00:24:44	I was reading an article in the JFS about literary forensics.
337	00:24:44	00:24:51	They use a computer program to analyze documents to determine authorship.
338	00:24:51	00:25:03	For instance, when the book Primary Colors was first published anonymously, people knew it was one of Clinton's speech writers, so they compared word usage and phrasing with the writers on his staff and discovered who'd probably written it.
339	00:25:03	00:25:05	I say we look at the work to find the author.
340	00:25:05	00:25:10	Try to figure out who it is by what message they're trying to send.
341	00:25:13	00:25:15	What?
342	00:25:15	00:25:17	That was a very good idea.
343	00:25:17	00:25:18	Well, I have one occasionally.
344	00:25:22	00:25:24	Okay.
345	00:25:24	00:25:27	Look, clearly the killer is into signatures, right?
346	00:25:27	00:25:33	I mean, the miniatures themselves are signatures, and then within each miniature, they all have this doll thing.
347	00:25:33	00:25:34	That creepy little Sally.
348	00:25:34	00:25:38	Well, we're working under the assumption that the killer was a foster kid, right?
349	00:25:38	00:25:40	With probably an abusive childhood.
350	00:25:40	00:25:41	So a bloody baby doll?
351	00:25:41	00:25:44	I mean, it's really not that much of a stretch to say that the doll represents the killer.
352	00:25:45	00:25:47	Grissom had something on that.
353	00:25:47	00:25:54	Freud's Theory of the Uncanny raises the point that as children, we want the doll to come to life, but as adults, we are terrified by the idea.
354	00:25:55	00:25:59	Doll could represent the uncanny that is feared, the Sandman.
355	00:25:59	00:26:02	Right. Or exactly what I just said.
356	00:26:02	00:26:11	So, we're looking for an obsessive, meticulous, dark-ass misanthrope who seeks recognition for his efforts.
357	00:26:18	00:26:19	When would I find the time?
358	00:26:19	00:26:21	I'm always here.
359	00:26:22	00:26:24	Can I have a chip? No.
360	00:26:25	00:26:26	Here.
361	00:26:26	00:26:27	Thank you.
362	00:26:27	00:26:29	You're welcome.
363	00:26:31	00:26:33	All the miniatures have food.
364	00:26:33	00:26:35	Eggs...
365	00:26:36	00:26:38	booze...
366	00:26:40	00:26:43	Tea and cookies...
367	00:26:43	00:26:46	And a chicken?
368	00:26:46	00:26:49	But is it considered food if it's still alive and clucking?
369	00:26:49	00:26:52	You've never lived in Pennsylvania.
370	00:26:52	00:26:57	I think if the killer is trying to make some sort of anti-food statement, there are much better places in Vegas to do it.
371	00:26:57	00:26:58	Like blowing up a buffet.
372	00:26:58	00:27:00	Yeah. Gluttons eating crab legs.
373	00:27:00	00:27:01	That's exactly where I'd start.
374	00:27:06	00:27:08	Did you guys see Scream?
375	00:27:17	00:27:19	Hello?
376	00:27:21	00:27:24	Oh, hi, Catherine.
377	00:27:24	00:27:25	Have I seen Wendy?
378	00:27:25	00:27:26	Uh, no.
379	00:27:27	00:27:29	She hasn't been at her desk all day long. Give me...
380	00:27:29	00:27:30	Here, let me look for her.
381	00:27:30	00:27:31	Oh, oh, wait, here she is.
382	00:27:31	00:27:33	Loser.
383	00:27:33	00:27:34	Hey, Catherine, what's up?
384	00:27:34	00:27:37	Hey, you said you were gonna rush DNA off that Taser that I checked in.
385	00:27:37	00:27:38	Yeah, I did.
386	00:27:38	00:27:45	And the blood on the Taser tips did match your heart attack victim, but I also found a second male contributor who's probably your suspect.
387	00:27:45	00:27:51	Run the unknown against the semen that I found on the clown wig from my Peeping Tom case last month.
388	00:27:51	00:27:53	Um, sure. Why?
389	00:27:53	00:27:56	Let's just say I got a real good hunch about this one.
390	00:27:56	00:27:58	Who's the big clown now, huh?
391	00:28:05	00:28:07	What about music?
392	00:28:07	00:28:13	Izzy has gold records, Penny had a record player, Barbara had high-end stereo equipment.
393	00:28:14	00:28:15	Yeah, but what about the chicken plant?
394	00:28:15	00:28:17	The squeals of dying chickens?
395	00:28:17	00:28:19	No go, amigo.
396	00:28:19	00:28:20	What about flowers?
397	00:28:20	00:28:22	The flower delivery guy might have access to the space.
398	00:28:22	00:28:27	Well, I see flowers in Penny's and Barbara's, but not Izzy's.
399	00:28:30	00:28:31	Flour canister?
400	00:28:31	00:28:32	Stop that.
401	00:28:33	00:28:36	Besides, I don't think the slaughterhouse would be into the lobby bouquet.
402	00:28:37	00:28:38	What about mail?
403	00:28:38	00:28:39	A crazed postal worker.
404	00:28:39	00:28:40	Wouldn't be the first time.
405	00:28:41	00:28:45	There's mail on the counter, mail on the floors, mail on the desk...
406	00:28:45	00:28:47	No mail in the henhouse.
407	00:28:47	00:28:50	Maybe they have puns in common.
408	00:28:50	00:28:56	Look, if this is really about the killer trying to reveal something, is there anything that's gotten more in-your-face with each successive miniature?
409	00:28:56	00:29:01	Well, the way he kills has certainly gotten more complicated.
410	00:29:01	00:29:07	Blunt force trauma to poison to electrocution to a timed booby trap of carbon monoxide in the fireplace.
411	00:29:07	00:29:08	What about newspaper?
412	00:29:08	00:29:14	Starts out on the counter, then all over the floor, then with the doll, as the headline.
413	00:29:14	00:29:15	That's bolder and bolder.
414	00:29:15	00:29:19	See, again, there's no newspaper in the chicken plant, not even shredded in the cages.
415	00:29:19	00:29:20	Okay, buzz kill.
416	00:29:20	00:29:22	You come up with a theory.
417	00:29:22	00:29:24	Hey, it's not me, it's the Chicken plant.
418	00:29:24	00:29:26	That's the streak-breaker.
419	00:29:26	00:29:29	Well, then, maybe we should start with that one and work our way out.
420	00:29:41	00:29:42	Can you smell that?
421	00:29:42	00:29:43	Yes.
422	00:29:43	00:29:45	You shouldn't be able to smell that through your suit.
423	00:29:46	00:29:47	Good to know.
424	00:29:55	00:29:59	Did you know that rodents have skeletons with flexible joints?
425	00:29:59	00:30:01	No.
426	00:30:01	00:30:06	If they can get their head through something, the rest of their body can contort to fit.
427	00:30:06	00:30:10	They can crawl into spaces as small as a quarter.
428	00:30:11	00:30:13	Lousy varmints.
429	00:30:16	00:30:18	Bastard hit the main line.
430	00:30:23	00:30:25	That's not the only thing he's got in his mouth.
431	00:30:44	00:30:46	What do you think, Doc?
432	00:30:46	00:30:49	My guess would be black tar heroin.
433	00:30:49	00:30:51	Looks like the rat ate the mule.
434	00:31:10	00:31:11	Okay, look, we gave it a try.
435	00:31:11	00:31:13	There's nothing in this thing but machinery.
436	00:31:13	00:31:15	Let's just put it back.
437	00:31:15	00:31:16	Chill out.
438	00:31:25	00:31:26	What's this?
439	00:31:41	00:31:43	You freaking broke it!
440	00:31:43	00:31:44	That's destroying evidence.
441	00:31:45	00:31:46	I can fix it.
442	00:31:47	00:31:51	Have any of you guys seen Grissom?
443	00:31:53	00:31:55	Some garlic bread?
444	00:31:55	00:31:57	Nice Chianti, maybe?
445	00:31:57	00:31:58	Kiss my ass.
446	00:31:58	00:32:04	I'd like to see you crawl around in a Dumpster determining the difference between blood and marinara sauce with six mobster goons giving you the stink eye.
447	00:32:04	00:32:06	Wouldn't know anything about that.
448	00:32:06	00:32:07	We're holed up in a lab all day.
449	00:32:07	00:32:09	What are you guys doing?
450	00:32:11	00:32:12	You know, forget it.
451	00:32:13	00:32:14	I don't even care.
452	00:32:14	00:32:16	I need to go take a shower.
453	00:32:16	00:32:19	Would one of you please call janitorial and have them clean my Denali?
454	00:32:19	00:32:20	Sure.
455	00:32:20	00:32:24	Oh, and, uh, we think the killer might have threw up in the alley.
456	00:32:24	00:32:26	Full panel.
457	00:32:26	00:32:27	Enjoy.
458	00:32:28	00:32:31	Got to go.
459	00:32:31	00:32:31	Good luck.
460	00:32:40	00:32:42	NaOCl.
461	00:32:43	00:32:46	Bleach.
462	00:32:46	00:32:49	There was bleach at the Izzy Delancy scene.
463	00:32:52	00:32:55	And in the vase water at Barbara Tillman's condo.
464	00:32:55	00:32:58	Why?
465	00:32:58	00:33:02	Put a few drop in the water, helps kill bacteria keeps the flowers blooming a long time.
466	00:33:02	00:33:07	Put too much bleach, flowers die.
467	00:33:07	00:33:09	What about Penny?
468	00:33:11	00:33:12	Okay.
469	00:33:12	00:33:14	You stay here.
470	00:33:14	00:33:16	I'm going to switch this out for the Penny Garden.
471	00:33:16	00:33:18	No, you know what? No.
472	00:33:18	00:33:25	Look, this entire thing has turned into a three-ring circus, 'cause every time we get something, something else just comes along and proves us wrong.
473	00:33:25	00:33:28	And, honestly, I think you've lost your damn mind.
474	00:33:28	00:33:31	I mean, what makes you think if the CSIs can't solve this, that we can?
475	00:33:31	00:33:34	Seriously. I'm a little tired of your delusions of grandeur.
476	00:33:34	00:33:37	And I'm way behind in work, and I'm sick of sneaking around.
477	00:33:37	00:33:39	So that's it.
478	00:33:39	00:33:41	I'm out.
479	00:34:09	00:34:10	Hey.
480	00:34:10	00:34:12	Hey.
481	00:34:12	00:34:13	Here you go.
482	00:34:13	00:34:14	I checked under the keys.
483	00:34:15	00:34:17	Crusty white stains, pale blue under ALS.
484	00:34:17	00:34:19	Semen, huh?
485	00:34:19	00:34:21	What made you check under the keys?
486	00:34:21	00:34:23	A buttprint on the credenza.
487	00:34:24	00:34:26	Yeah, okay, that's gross.
488	00:34:26	00:34:32	CDC contacted us, because the whole office has a herpes simplex 1 outbreak, and nobody could figure out why.
489	00:34:32	00:34:35	I guess you never really know what's going on in your office.
490	00:34:37	00:34:38	Hey, Sara?
491	00:34:38	00:34:44	Is it true that the Miniature cases have been keeping Grissom up at night?
492	00:34:44	00:34:46	How would I know?
493	00:34:46	00:34:54	I just thought that maybe you guys all talk about this it, and... Hodges told me that Grissom confided in him and...
494	00:34:54	00:34:55	You know what? Never mind.
495	00:34:56	00:34:57	Just forget I even asked.
496	00:34:57	00:35:01	Well, listen, I-I don't know what Hodges has been telling you, but...
497	00:35:01	00:35:05	do you really think that Grissom would confide in him?
498	00:35:05	00:35:06	About anything?
499	00:35:07	00:35:08	No.
500	00:35:08	00:35:10	Of course not.
501	00:35:13	00:35:16	You are a liar and an ass.
502	00:35:16	00:35:20	I mean, if you want to go running around like Sir Galahad, just yanking swords willy-nilly, that is totally your business.
503	00:35:20	00:35:23	But you put all of us at risk here.
504	00:35:25	00:35:27	I think we might be onto something with the bleach.
505	00:35:27	00:35:28	Hey! Stop!
506	00:35:28	00:35:32	Archie and Henry gave up a full day's work thinking that they were doing something to help Grissom.
507	00:35:32	00:35:35	And Grissom never even asked you to do this in the first place.
508	00:35:35	00:35:38	Technically, all I said to them was that Grissom needed our help, which is true.
509	00:35:38	00:35:40	I only lied to you.
510	00:35:40	00:35:42	Aren't you worried about your own caseload?
511	00:35:42	00:35:47	I've trained them all to believe that the laser ablater and mass spec take twice as long as they actually do.
512	00:35:47	00:35:49	Oh, my God.
513	00:35:49	00:35:50	I cannot believe you.
514	00:35:50	00:35:54	I can't believe that, for half a second, I actually thought that I might...
515	00:35:54	00:35:55	You what?
516	00:35:55	00:35:56	Nothing.
517	00:35:56	00:35:59	What on God's green earth possessed you to do this?
518	00:36:01	00:36:02	It's my lucky day.
519	00:36:02	00:36:04	What?
520	00:36:05	00:36:08	It's my lucky day.
521	00:37:16	00:37:18	Yes.
522	00:37:25	00:37:26	Well, enjoy. That guy was putrid.
523	00:37:26	00:37:29	Oh, by the way, you left the miniatures unlocked.
524	00:37:29	00:37:33	Yeah, I've been looking at those a lot lately.
525	00:37:39	00:37:43	When you walked away, it was like the stars aligned.
526	00:37:43	00:37:45	It was my lucky day.
527	00:37:45	00:37:47	Lucky?
528	00:37:47	00:37:49	You're a scientist.
529	00:37:49	00:37:50	I was trying to help Grissom.
530	00:37:50	00:37:52	(chuckles) Come on.
531	00:37:52	00:37:55	If Gil Grissom were here, he'd slap your face.
532	00:38:02	00:38:03	Yeah, I recognize him.
533	00:38:03	00:38:06	His street name's Ralo Perez.
534	00:38:06	00:38:08	He's a drug runner for the Jamaican mob.
535	00:38:08	00:38:13	According to sources, he was skimming, swallowing a couple balloons for personal use.
536	00:38:13	00:38:15	He dropped out of sight a couple of weeks ago.
537	00:38:15	00:38:17	He dropped into Lake Mead.
538	00:38:17	00:38:19	Well, that's one off my desk.
539	00:38:19	00:38:23	Well, I'll get the drugs to Tox, and we'll wrap this up.
540	00:39:31	00:39:32	This better be good, Dave.
541	00:39:34	00:39:36	Bleach.
542	00:39:36	00:39:37	What?
543	00:39:38	00:39:41	I found a common element in all four miniatures...
544	00:39:41	00:39:43	bleach.
545	00:39:43	00:39:52	There's a bottle of it in the trash at Izzy's; there's a barrel of it at the chicken plant, There's, uh, bleach in the flower water at Barbara's condo, and now...
546	00:39:52	00:39:56	a bleach coupon in Penny's.
547	00:39:56	00:40:07	This-this may sound crazy, but if the killer is a housekeeper or a janitor, they would certainly know the ins and outs of each location, uh, what goes in what drawer, what book on what bookshelf.
548	00:40:07	00:40:09	Hours of operation, habits, schedules.
549	00:40:09	00:40:17	I've thought a lot about the killer's pathology, and there doesn't seem to be any regular interval between murders, which makes me think that they're triggered by something.
550	00:40:17	00:40:23	Maybe... maybe the killer is triggered by bleach.
551	00:40:28	00:40:30	The bellows.
552	00:40:31	00:40:32	I'm sorry?
553	00:40:32	00:40:34	James Tilly Matthews.
554	00:40:34	00:40:36	Early 19th century London.
555	00:40:36	00:40:39	Matthews was in Bedlam Hospital awaiting trial.
556	00:40:39	00:40:42	Doctors were trying to determine his sanity.
557	00:40:42	00:40:44	Several interviewed him.
558	00:40:44	00:40:47	Half thought he was sane, half insane.
559	00:40:47	00:40:49	Turns out he was perfectly normal...
560	00:40:49	00:40:53	except when someone mentioned politics.
561	00:40:53	00:41:04	At that point, he'd go into a rage about the little men who lived underground and used a bellows to push thoughts into his mind, as well as the minds of Parliament and the Queen.
562	00:41:04	00:41:12	A specific object or word that triggers the urge to kill.
563	00:41:12	00:41:14	That's a form of delusional psychosis.
564	00:41:14	00:41:17	Rare, but does exist.
565	00:41:17	00:41:24	If the killer is one of Ernie Dell's foster kids, maybe bleach played a role in some sort of childhood abuse.
566	00:41:25	00:41:27	He's getting back at the world for what they did to him.
567	00:41:27	00:41:31	Well, if having bleach in your home is the common element among victims...
568	00:41:33	00:41:35	...then anyone can be next.
569	00:41:35	00:41:38	Did the victims use a common cleaning service?
570	00:41:38	00:41:42	Not that we know of.
571	00:41:42	00:41:52	However, it's not unusual for people with these pathologies to become vocal toward the institutions that they feel propagate the trigger.
572	00:41:52	00:41:58	Maybe we could call bleach manufacturing companies and see if they've received any hate mail.
573	00:41:58	00:42:01	Cross reference correspondence with Vegas postmarks.
574	00:42:01	00:42:04	Might be able to narrow down neighborhoods.
575	00:42:07	00:42:08	Good job, Hodges.
576	00:42:09	00:42:11	Really.
577	00:42:14	00:42:15	Now...
578	00:42:15	00:42:17	Do you mind?
579	00:42:19	00:42:21	Absolutely...
580	00:42:27	00:42:31	I... I'm sorry if I crossed the line.
581	00:42:31	00:42:32	It won't happen again.
