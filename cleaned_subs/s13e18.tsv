0	00:00:06	00:00:07	Leave me alone!
1	00:00:10	00:00:12	Stay away!
2	00:00:46	00:00:52	Homeless couple was camped there with the group under the overpass, spotted the body and flagged down a patrol unit.
3	00:00:52	00:00:53	David.
4	00:00:53	00:00:56	Hey. Well, looks like somebody beat you to the burrito wrap here.
5	00:00:56	00:00:58	I would've done a better job, though.
6	00:01:00	00:01:01	Camouflage.
7	00:01:01	00:01:03	Says, maybe, military.
8	00:01:03	00:01:06	Yeah, or army surplus-- you know, camping stuff.
9	00:01:08	00:01:12	It reminds me of when I used to go hunting with my old man.
10	00:01:12	00:01:13	I never pegged you as a hunter.
11	00:01:13	00:01:15	Of course I was a hunter.
12	00:01:15	00:01:16	Just never got into the killing part.
13	00:01:19	00:01:23	Apparently, someone doesn't have the same reverence for life as you do.
14	00:01:23	00:01:25	Massive bruising on the face.
15	00:01:25	00:01:26	He took a real beating.
16	00:01:29	00:01:32	Yeah, and that looks like some kind of animal bite on his leg.
17	00:01:32	00:01:36	Vital response in the tissue means it happened while he was still alive.
18	00:01:37	00:01:39	A wolf or...
19	00:01:39	00:01:41	a coyote, some kind of dog.
20	00:01:41	00:01:43	But I think dogs were the least of this guy's worries.
21	00:01:43	00:01:45	Somebody took his hands.
22	00:01:45	00:01:47	Well, a dog didn't do that.
23	00:01:47	00:01:50	No wallet, no I.D.
24	00:01:50	00:01:51	No hands, no fingerprints.
25	00:01:51	00:01:56	Well, then again, if we're talking about hunting, maybe the killer took the hands as a trophy.
26	00:01:56	00:02:01	Either way, we have no I.D., and we have no idea where this guy came from.
27	00:02:01	00:02:04	We're stumped.
28	00:02:04	00:02:06	Sorry. I'm just saying, this is gonna be a tough one.
29	00:02:08	00:02:10	They always are, Super Dave.
30	00:02:10	00:02:12	They always are.
31	00:02:48	00:02:50	This a traffic camera?
32	00:02:50	00:02:51	On Sunrise Boulevard.
33	00:02:51	00:02:54	Got a detail of the drainage basin, blew it up.
34	00:02:54	00:02:56	Picked up an image of this guy dumping our victim.
35	00:02:56	00:02:58	Time code-- 36 a.m.
36	00:02:58	00:03:00	It's about five hours ago.
37	00:03:00	00:03:03	Well, maybe our killer will show his face.
38	00:03:03	00:03:04	Freeze that, right there.
39	00:03:04	00:03:07	I can enhance it.
40	00:03:10	00:03:12	Night vision goggles?
41	00:03:12	00:03:13	That's some serious hardware.
42	00:03:13	00:03:15	Nick thought that our guy was a hunter.
43	00:03:15	00:03:17	Who's hunting humans?
44	00:03:17	00:03:21	Man is the most dangerous game.
45	00:03:30	00:03:34	He has a knee brace. Must have had an old injury.
46	00:03:34	00:03:36	Vonner Sports Motocross.
47	00:03:36	00:03:37	You know, a lot of this gear is custom-made.
48	00:03:37	00:03:40	Might be able to get an I.D. from the manufacturer.
49	00:03:40	00:03:42	There's something in his little pocket.
50	00:03:42	00:03:44	Looks like a wad of paper.
51	00:03:46	00:03:48	Maybe it's something more.
52	00:03:50	00:03:51	Huh.
53	00:03:54	00:03:55	Paper crane.
54	00:03:55	00:03:57	You think our victim was into origami?
55	00:03:57	00:03:59	Or our killer was trying to leave us a clue.
56	00:03:59	00:04:04	How about you chase the crane, and I'll get our John Doe to Doc Robbins.
57	00:04:06	00:04:12	C.O.D.'s exsanguination due to bisection of the right wrist, rupturing the radial and ulnar arteries.
58	00:04:12	00:04:14	The right hand was severed peri-mortem?
59	00:04:14	00:04:16	That's correct.
60	00:04:16	00:04:21	Well, we assumed both hands were removed postmortem to prevent identification or possibly taken as trophies.
61	00:04:21	00:04:23	Well, that's the case with the left hand.
62	00:04:23	00:04:25	The injury here is definitely postmortem.
63	00:04:25	00:04:27	In both instances, the method was crude.
64	00:04:27	00:04:31	I can't tell you what tool was used, but I sent swabs from the wounds over to Hodges.
65	00:04:31	00:04:33	What about the animal bite on his leg?
66	00:04:33	00:04:34	It was no animal.
67	00:04:34	00:04:36	It was man-made. Come on over here.
68	00:04:39	00:04:43	Perfect symmetry of the punctures was the tell.
69	00:04:46	00:04:48	A bear trap?
70	00:04:48	00:04:51	Well, it's consistent with our theory that the killer may be a hunter.
71	00:04:51	00:04:54	I also found this in the postmortem wound.
72	00:04:54	00:04:57	Appears to be some kind of synthetic.
73	00:04:57	00:04:59	Could help us find our primary.
74	00:04:59	00:05:00	I'll get it to Hodges.
75	00:05:00	00:05:02	Thanks, Doc.
76	00:05:48	00:05:49	Mm.
77	00:05:50	00:05:51	Hey. (groans)
78	00:05:51	00:05:53	I see your artist remains anonymous.
79	00:05:53	00:05:54	Yeah.
80	00:05:54	00:05:56	I didn't fare much better myself.
81	00:05:56	00:06:01	The green sliver Doc found on the body is a polypropylene blend with green dye.
82	00:06:01	00:06:03	Artificial turf. Indeed.
83	00:06:03	00:06:06	And I didn't find any trace that put us closer to the primary.
84	00:06:06	00:06:09	(sighs) So we both struck out. Mm.
85	00:06:10	00:06:14	You know, I dated a Japanese girl in college.
86	00:06:14	00:06:17	Washi is the paper traditionally used by the masters.
87	00:06:17	00:06:25	Tougher than ordinary pulped paper, it's often made from the bark of the gampi tree, or sometimes from the mitsumata shrub... Hodges.
88	00:06:25	00:06:31	All I'm saying is in origami, sometimes the medium is the message.
89	00:06:31	00:06:34	As in, that is not proper origami paper.
90	00:06:34	00:06:37	Our crane may not be speaking to us, but the paper might.
91	00:06:39	00:06:42	Okay, thanks for the info.
92	00:06:42	00:06:43	Hey.
93	00:06:43	00:06:45	Hey. Get up there and lay down, boy.
94	00:06:45	00:06:46	Is it bring your dog to work day?
95	00:06:46	00:06:48	We were just coming home from the vet.
96	00:06:48	00:06:52	I thought I'd bring him up here to see some friends, maybe cheer him up a little bit.
97	00:06:52	00:06:54	(Sam whines) I bet you Sam's bored.
98	00:06:54	00:06:56	Are you kidding me? This dog's living the life.
99	00:06:56	00:07:00	Nick, he used to be a cop; now he's retired.
100	00:07:00	00:07:03	He probably misses the field.
101	00:07:03	00:07:05	Is she right, Sam?
102	00:07:05	00:07:07	You bored? You want to do some work? Travaillez?
103	00:07:09	00:07:10	Told you.
104	00:07:10	00:07:19	Speaking of getting to work, that custom knee brace that Greg found on our victim-- manufacturer said it was ordered by a Dylan Trigg.
105	00:07:19	00:07:20	Summerlin address.
106	00:07:20	00:07:22	Sounds like we just I.D.'d our John Doe.
107	00:07:22	00:07:26	I'm heading out there now with Crawford to give notification.
108	00:07:26	00:07:29	We don't envy you that, do we, Sam?
109	00:07:30	00:07:32	Mm.
110	00:07:43	00:07:45	Yeah, excuse me, sir.
111	00:07:45	00:07:47	I'm Detective Crawford, this is CSI Brody, LVPD.
112	00:07:47	00:07:49	My crazy neighbor call you guys again?
113	00:07:49	00:07:51	I'm sorry, I don't understand. My pickup.
114	00:07:51	00:07:53	Guy keeps complaining that I park it on the street.
115	00:07:53	00:07:57	So I park in front of his house-- what's the big deal? It's a public street.
116	00:07:57	00:07:59	Nobody called about your truck, sir.
117	00:07:59	00:08:01	Um, does a Dylan Trigg live here?
118	00:08:01	00:08:04	Yeah. Dylan's my son.
119	00:08:06	00:08:08	What's this about?
120	00:08:08	00:08:11	Mr. Trigg, when's the last time you saw your son?
121	00:08:11	00:08:13	Five minutes ago.
122	00:08:13	00:08:16	Hey, Dylan, can you come out here?
123	00:08:16	00:08:19	You say your friend's name is Carl Abrams?
124	00:08:19	00:08:22	Yeah, I loaned Carl some of my motocross gear a couple days ago.
125	00:08:22	00:08:27	Uh, this is us at the freestyle competition in Laughlin last year.
126	00:08:27	00:08:29	That's where he dinged his knee.
127	00:08:32	00:08:37	You said somebody... killed Carl.
128	00:08:37	00:08:40	(sighs) I mean, I-I don't understand. What happened?
129	00:08:40	00:08:42	That's what we're trying to figure out.
130	00:08:42	00:08:44	Did it go down up near Koval Ridge?
131	00:08:44	00:08:46	Why do you ask that?
132	00:08:46	00:08:49	We were supposed to go camping there this weekend.
133	00:08:49	00:08:51	But I bailed at the last minute.
134	00:08:51	00:08:53	And why didn't you go?
135	00:08:53	00:08:55	There's something about that place, man.
136	00:08:55	00:08:57	Creeps me out.
137	00:08:57	00:09:01	What about it? There's this whole Hunger Games, Road Warrior vibe up there.
138	00:09:01	00:09:04	All these people waiting for the world to end-- it's kind of scary.
139	00:09:04	00:09:06	Carl loved the place.
140	00:09:06	00:09:07	He camped there by himself.
141	00:09:07	00:09:09	Loved exploring around the old mines.
142	00:09:09	00:09:12	He told me he'd strike it rich one day.
143	00:09:12	00:09:15	Do you know any spots maybe your buddy liked to camp in?
144	00:09:15	00:09:20	If I was gonna go looking for him, I'd probably look in the areas around those old mines.
145	00:09:20	00:09:22	Sorry, I-I wish I knew more.
146	00:09:22	00:09:26	Maybe if... if I had been up there with him, this wouldn't have happened.
147	00:09:39	00:09:42	Hey, Crawford, you there?
148	00:09:42	00:09:43	Copy.
149	00:09:43	00:09:46	All right, listen, we're about a mile from Pielstick mine.
150	00:09:46	00:09:49	We're gonna start our search with the dog over here, okay?
151	00:09:49	00:09:51	Copy that. We're on the south side of the ridge.
152	00:09:51	00:09:53	Haven't found anything yet.
153	00:09:53	00:09:54	Venez. Let me know.
154	00:09:54	00:09:56	Roger that.
155	00:09:56	00:09:57	Yeah, let's go, troops.
156	00:09:57	00:09:59	Restez ici.
157	00:09:59	00:10:02	Tr√®s bien. All right, we're gonna find out where Carl Abrams came from.
158	00:10:02	00:10:05	This is a swatch from the victim's shirt.
159	00:10:05	00:10:06	Got it?
160	00:10:06	00:10:07	Trouvez.
161	00:10:38	00:10:40	There he is.
162	00:10:41	00:10:43	Hang on, I think he's got something.
163	00:10:43	00:10:45	Hang on.
164	00:10:45	00:10:46	What is it, boy? (barking)
165	00:10:46	00:10:48	(whimpering) Huh? Sam?
166	00:10:48	00:10:49	Arr√™tez.
167	00:10:49	00:10:51	Good boy.
168	00:10:58	00:11:00	It's got a handle.
169	00:11:00	00:11:01	What is this, Lost?
170	00:11:01	00:11:03	We got some blood right here.
171	00:11:04	00:11:07	Sam, allez l√†-bas. Restez l√†.
172	00:11:16	00:11:17	More blood inside.
173	00:11:17	00:11:19	Yeah, yeah, here we go.
174	00:11:19	00:11:24	All this blood-- tells me this could be our primary.
175	00:11:24	00:11:25	Ready?
176	00:11:26	00:11:28	Restez ici, Sam.
177	00:12:00	00:12:02	They're just empty suits.
178	00:12:03	00:12:05	Motion sensor lights.
179	00:12:10	00:12:13	Fatigues...
180	00:12:13	00:12:15	night vision goggles.
181	00:12:15	00:12:17	Well, I've seen this before.
182	00:12:17	00:12:18	I'm gonna call for backup.
183	00:12:18	00:12:20	Crawford, it's Morgan.
184	00:12:20	00:12:23	We've got something.
185	00:12:23	00:12:24	Crawford?
186	00:12:24	00:12:27	You might want to go topside; I don't think you're gonna get a signal down here.
187	00:12:27	00:12:28	I'll be back.
188	00:12:28	00:12:30	'Kay.
189	00:12:30	00:12:31	Crawford.
190	00:12:31	00:12:32	Come in. It's Morgan.
191	00:12:32	00:12:33	Crawford, do you copy?
192	00:13:22	00:13:23	Hey, Morgan?
193	00:13:25	00:13:27	How we doing on that backup?
194	00:13:36	00:13:38	You don't belong here.
195	00:13:44	00:13:46	I'm with the LVPD.
196	00:13:46	00:13:47	I don't care who the hell you are.
197	00:13:47	00:13:48	You're trespassing.
198	00:13:48	00:13:50	And you're making a big mistake.
199	00:13:50	00:13:51	There's a whole lot of cops up there.
200	00:13:51	00:13:53	Gonna be coming through that door any second.
201	00:13:53	00:13:54	You think I'm stupid, pal?
202	00:13:54	00:13:56	You think I was born yesterday?
203	00:13:56	00:13:57	Nope.
204	00:13:57	00:14:00	But I think you may die today if you don't put the gun down.
205	00:14:02	00:14:04	Why the hell are you people here? Why?!
206	00:14:04	00:14:06	Put that shotgun down, and we'll talk about it.
207	00:14:06	00:14:09	Otherwise, they're gonna be scraping us both up off the ground.
208	00:14:09	00:14:10	Is that what you want?
209	00:14:10	00:14:11	You're here to arrest me?
210	00:14:11	00:14:13	We want to talk to you.
211	00:14:24	00:14:27	Guess I should have had them scrape us up off the floor.
212	00:14:28	00:14:30	Better than sitting here like a common criminal.
213	00:14:30	00:14:33	Well, that part's still to be determined, actually.
214	00:14:33	00:14:34	Who are you?
215	00:14:34	00:14:35	I'm CSI Russell.
216	00:14:35	00:14:37	Care to tell us who you are?
217	00:14:39	00:14:44	A lot of people are living off the grid nowadays, but y-you've taken it to a whole new level.
218	00:14:44	00:14:46	You-you have no identification.
219	00:14:46	00:14:49	So far, we've found nothing in your little bunker.
220	00:14:49	00:14:53	No bank statement, no utility bills, nothing with your name on it.
221	00:14:53	00:14:56	It's almost like you worked very hard to disappear, haven't you?
222	00:14:56	00:14:57	Is that a crime?
223	00:14:57	00:14:58	Well, I'm just wondering why.
224	00:14:58	00:15:01	Why?
225	00:15:01	00:15:03	You had no right to drag me out of my home.
226	00:15:03	00:15:06	Without as much as a word as to why.
227	00:15:06	00:15:08	You know why.
228	00:15:08	00:15:11	I've seen the way you treat trespassers.
229	00:15:11	00:15:13	You're not very hospitable.
230	00:15:13	00:15:15	Is that what happened with Carl Abrams?
231	00:15:15	00:15:16	He trespass?
232	00:15:17	00:15:20	I don't know Carl Abrams.
233	00:15:20	00:15:22	Okay.
234	00:15:22	00:15:24	That's fine if you don't want to cooperate.
235	00:15:24	00:15:28	We'll let your little hole in the ground do the talking.
236	00:15:37	00:15:39	Who does this?
237	00:15:40	00:15:42	(sighs) Someone prepping for doomsday.
238	00:15:42	00:15:46	Re-creating a world they believe will disappear with the coming Armageddon.
239	00:15:46	00:15:48	Tried to make something disappear.
240	00:15:48	00:15:50	Blood.
241	00:15:50	00:15:52	Lots of it.
242	00:15:52	00:15:54	Astroturf is porous, just like carpet.
243	00:16:00	00:16:02	That's a significant blood pool.
244	00:16:02	00:16:04	The killer severed Carl Abrams' right hand.
245	00:16:04	00:16:05	He bled out.
246	00:16:05	00:16:08	Could've been right here.
247	00:16:12	00:16:14	Doc Robbins found something like this in the victim's wound track.
248	00:16:16	00:16:18	Positive for blood.
249	00:16:18	00:16:20	Carl Abrams died here.
250	00:16:24	00:16:27	Place is lacking a certain survivalist touch.
251	00:16:27	00:16:30	Yeah, it doesn't really fit our man with no name, does it?
252	00:16:30	00:16:33	How long do you think the guy's been living down here like this?
253	00:16:33	00:16:39	Well, he's got a well-stocked pantry, he's got water, electricity.
254	00:16:39	00:16:41	I'd say for a while.
255	00:16:41	00:16:43	You know, I'd say we're done in this room.
256	00:16:43	00:16:47	There's no blood, there's no sign of disturbance, there's nothing probative in here.
257	00:16:47	00:16:49	All right, let's check the rest of the house.
258	00:17:00	00:17:02	Hey, Fin?
259	00:17:02	00:17:05	I think I found the master's master bedroom.
260	00:17:11	00:17:13	This decor is more like it.
261	00:17:38	00:17:41	I found his toys.
262	00:17:41	00:17:43	Sara, you got to see this.
263	00:17:50	00:17:51	This is not good.
264	00:17:51	00:17:53	Mm-mm.
265	00:17:53	00:17:55	Man keeps a room for a little girl in his hunting cave.
266	00:17:55	00:17:57	Yeah, it gets worse.
267	00:17:57	00:17:59	I don't think he uses the room just for little girls.
268	00:18:02	00:18:04	Women's clothes.
269	00:18:04	00:18:05	Yeah, and different sizes.
270	00:18:05	00:18:07	Could mean a number of different women.
271	00:18:07	00:18:09	Some of these labels are old.
272	00:18:09	00:18:11	Sutters?
273	00:18:11	00:18:13	That department store's been out of business for years.
274	00:18:18	00:18:21	Origami paper crane.
275	00:18:27	00:18:30	Just like the one I pulled out of Carl Abrams' pocket.
276	00:18:32	00:18:34	Do you think he makes one for each victim?
277	00:18:36	00:18:38	You recognize that?
278	00:18:40	00:18:41	We have your prints all over it.
279	00:18:43	00:18:47	it's not one of the origami animals we just found in your house, but it looks just like it.
280	00:18:47	00:18:55	This was in Carl Abrams' pocket when we found his body and his blood in your bunker.
281	00:18:55	00:18:57	I told you, I don't know the guy.
282	00:18:57	00:18:59	You're setting me up. You need a suspect.
283	00:18:59	00:19:02	And for whatever reason, you've chosen me.
284	00:19:02	00:19:04	Yeah, actually, you know what? Y-You reached out to us.
285	00:19:04	00:19:06	Here, take a look at that video.
286	00:19:06	00:19:08	See, you made the first move, didn't you?
287	00:19:08	00:19:10	Look, I know how this works.
288	00:19:10	00:19:11	Yeah, I'll bet you do.
289	00:19:11	00:19:12	That's it.
290	00:19:12	00:19:13	I've had enough of this pervert.
291	00:19:16	00:19:22	Why don't you tell us about the little girl's room you have set up down there.
292	00:19:22	00:19:24	And all the clothes from all those women.
293	00:19:24	00:19:26	I mean, how many were there?
294	00:19:26	00:19:28	You want me to admit to something that I didn't do.
295	00:19:28	00:19:29	Something that I have no knowledge of.
296	00:19:29	00:19:31	Well, I'm not playing your game!
297	00:19:31	00:19:36	All I want is to be left in peace. Is that what you told Carl Abrams before you killed him?
298	00:19:36	00:19:37	I don't know Carl.
299	00:19:37	00:19:39	He was camping in your area.
300	00:19:39	00:19:40	What happened?
301	00:19:40	00:19:45	Did he stumble upon your little piece of hell down there?
302	00:19:54	00:19:56	Got signs of sexual activity.
303	00:19:56	00:19:58	Not that I'm surprised.
304	00:19:58	00:19:59	Well, I'm surprised.
305	00:19:59	00:20:02	There is no blood here.
306	00:20:02	00:20:05	Well, a sex room isn't the same as a kill room.
307	00:20:05	00:20:07	He takes them somewhere else.
308	00:20:18	00:20:19	Did you hear that?
309	00:20:19	00:20:20	Yeah.
310	00:20:20	00:20:23	Sounds like it's coming from behind the wall.
311	00:20:23	00:20:24	Looks like an air vent.
312	00:20:26	00:20:27	There's no air coming out.
313	00:20:29	00:20:32	Whatever it is, it's inside the walls.
314	00:20:32	00:20:33	It's moving.
315	00:20:33	00:20:35	It's headed towards the yard.
316	00:20:35	00:20:37	It's trying to get away.
317	00:20:39	00:20:40	Stop. Hold on.
318	00:20:40	00:20:41	Stop right there! Wait, wait!
319	00:20:43	00:20:44	Stop. It's okay.
320	00:20:44	00:20:45	Stop. We're the police.
321	00:20:45	00:20:47	No one's gonna hurt you.
322	00:20:47	00:20:48	We're here to help you, okay?
323	00:20:48	00:20:51	What's your name?
324	00:20:51	00:20:52	We're gonna get you out of here.
325	00:20:52	00:20:53	You're safe now.
326	00:20:53	00:20:55	You're okay.
327	00:20:55	00:20:58	You're safe.
328	00:21:46	00:21:50	We may not know your name, but we're starting to get a pretty good picture of your crimes.
329	00:21:50	00:21:51	We found the girl.
330	00:21:51	00:21:53	One you've been holding captive.
331	00:21:53	00:21:55	The one you kidnapped.
332	00:21:55	00:21:56	And raped.
333	00:21:56	00:22:00	And probably would've murdered, just like all the others.
334	00:22:00	00:22:02	Remember how we asked you how many women there were?
335	00:22:02	00:22:04	Well, we've already found one.
336	00:22:04	00:22:06	Rebecca Barnes.
337	00:22:06	00:22:08	Recognize her?
338	00:22:09	00:22:14	Or have there just been so many, you can't even remember at this point?
339	00:22:14	00:22:17	Found her dress in your bunker.
340	00:22:17	00:22:21	The DNA on it traces to an unsolved murder in Carson City 11 years ago.
341	00:22:23	00:22:25	Was she your first?
342	00:22:25	00:22:27	Is that why you kept the dress?
343	00:22:27	00:22:29	As a trophy?
344	00:22:29	00:22:31	You people have no idea what you're talking about.
345	00:22:31	00:22:33	Then you tell us!
346	00:22:33	00:22:39	What drives a man to kidnap, to rape, and to murder?
347	00:22:39	00:22:41	I wouldn't know.
348	00:22:41	00:22:47	This woman that you said that I murdered, Rebecca Barnes-- she was my wife.
349	00:22:47	00:22:52	And the girl that you found-- the one you accused me of...
350	00:22:54	00:22:57	Her name...
351	00:22:57	00:22:59	it's Miranda.
352	00:22:59	00:23:01	And that's my little girl.
353	00:23:03	00:23:05	She's all I have left in this world.
354	00:23:24	00:23:27	Just got the file on the Rebecca Barnes homicide from Carson City.
355	00:23:27	00:23:30	Bunker Boy's name is Tommy Barnes.
356	00:23:30	00:23:35	He was the husband and primary suspect in his wife's murder until Carson City cleared him.
357	00:23:35	00:23:36	That explains the attitude.
358	00:23:36	00:23:38	He thought the cops were coming after him again.
359	00:23:38	00:23:40	Says here they never caught the killer?
360	00:23:40	00:23:42	Yeah, still an open case.
361	00:23:42	00:23:44	Barnes's daughter Miranda was seven years old at the time.
362	00:23:44	00:23:48	After he was cleared, he told police he was taking his daughter and leaving town.
363	00:23:48	00:23:50	Then went underground, literally.
364	00:23:50	00:23:54	DNA confirms the only contributors on the women's clothes are his wife and his daughter.
365	00:23:54	00:23:56	Different sizes.
366	00:23:56	00:24:01	He kept his wife's dresses, then he bought his kid new clothes as she was growing up.
367	00:24:01	00:24:06	Sad story, but none of that clears him on the murder of Carl Abrams.
368	00:24:06	00:24:08	No. No, it doesn't.
369	00:24:11	00:24:13	Where's my daughter?
370	00:24:13	00:24:14	I want to see her.
371	00:24:14	00:24:16	She's fine.
372	00:24:16	00:24:19	She's in the hospital, getting checked out.
373	00:24:19	00:24:21	It's just a...
374	00:24:21	00:24:24	It's a formality.
375	00:24:24	00:24:28	I'm gonna, uh, take your cuffs off here.
376	00:24:33	00:24:34	Mr. Barnes...
377	00:24:36	00:24:39	...why don't you and I start over again.
378	00:24:39	00:24:41	With an apology.
379	00:24:42	00:24:46	I was just told about Carson City.
380	00:24:46	00:24:49	I can't even begin to know what that was like.
381	00:24:49	00:24:53	Losing your wife, having the police suspect you like that.
382	00:24:53	00:24:55	For months.
383	00:24:55	00:25:00	While that animal who killed Rebecca is still out there, free.
384	00:25:03	00:25:05	I, um...
385	00:25:05	00:25:07	read the case file.
386	00:25:09	00:25:15	Your daughter Miranda was there when-when your wife was abducted from the mall parking lot.
387	00:25:15	00:25:18	It could have been both of them taken away from me.
388	00:25:18	00:25:20	Mr. Barnes, I'm so sorry.
389	00:25:24	00:25:26	Thanks.
390	00:25:28	00:25:30	You know, Rebecca was my high school sweetheart.
391	00:25:33	00:25:35	We had a perfect life.
392	00:25:35	00:25:37	Nice house, good friends, part of a church.
393	00:25:37	00:25:46	You never expect to wake up one morning, leave your home, you go to work, the wife does some shopping-- just a normal day.
394	00:25:46	00:25:49	When you get back home...
395	00:25:49	00:25:51	it's all gone.
396	00:25:51	00:25:55	And-and that's when you-you went underground?
397	00:25:55	00:26:02	Well, in the '50s, before my grandfather donated the land to the state, he built a fallout shelter to protect his family.
398	00:26:02	00:26:05	And you decided that's how you were gonna protect your family, too.
399	00:26:05	00:26:08	What was left of it.
400	00:26:08	00:26:10	So I built a home in the bunker.
401	00:26:10	00:26:12	I'd take odd jobs in the area.
402	00:26:12	00:26:15	I provided Miranda with everything she needed.
403	00:26:15	00:26:17	Food, shelter.
404	00:26:17	00:26:19	I even homeschooled her.
405	00:26:19	00:26:23	Well, that's a great plan when she's seven.
406	00:26:23	00:26:26	What about now when she's 17?
407	00:26:26	00:26:28	Miranda has everything that she needs.
408	00:26:28	00:26:32	You and I both know that's not true.
409	00:26:32	00:26:37	We found evidence of sexual activity in your daughter's bed.
410	00:26:37	00:26:38	Two DNA contributions.
411	00:26:38	00:26:42	Two men-- one unknown, the other one, our victim, Carl Abrams.
412	00:26:42	00:26:44	You're lying. I know my daughter.
413	00:26:44	00:26:47	You just told me that you took odd jobs.
414	00:26:47	00:26:48	That gets you out of the house.
415	00:26:48	00:26:52	Your daughter-- she's lonely, she's curious, she ventures out.
416	00:26:52	00:26:55	No, she would never leave on her own, not without me.
417	00:26:55	00:27:01	Mr. Barnes, Carl Abrams' semen in your daughter's bed, his blood in your house.
418	00:27:01	00:27:02	Now, come on.
419	00:27:02	00:27:05	Look, I know you'd do anything to protect your daughter.
420	00:27:05	00:27:08	I just told you, I'm not a murderer.
421	00:27:08	00:27:09	Did he break in? Did he threaten Miranda?
422	00:27:09	00:27:11	You guys are all the same, aren't you?
423	00:27:11	00:27:13	Here, Carson City-- it's the same.
424	00:27:15	00:27:17	I'm done talking to you.
425	00:27:23	00:27:25	I need to ask you some questions.
426	00:27:25	00:27:27	Miranda.
427	00:27:27	00:27:29	Yes, I-I do know your name.
428	00:27:29	00:27:33	And I know how you and your dad ended up in that bunker.
429	00:27:33	00:27:40	But what I don't know is what happened to Carl Abrams two nights ago.
430	00:27:40	00:27:42	And I need you to tell me.
431	00:27:42	00:27:44	I can't help you.
432	00:27:44	00:27:46	Yes, you can.
433	00:27:46	00:27:52	This is a DNA report which tells me that there were two boys in your bed.
434	00:27:54	00:27:56	One of whom was Carl.
435	00:27:56	00:27:57	No, that's a lie.
436	00:27:57	00:27:59	I've never been with any boys.
437	00:27:59	00:28:01	What happened?
438	00:28:01	00:28:04	Was the other boy jealous of Carl?
439	00:28:04	00:28:06	Did they fight?
440	00:28:06	00:28:08	I know Carl was hurt.
441	00:28:08	00:28:11	He went down into the bunker to you for help.
442	00:28:11	00:28:13	Leave me alone.
443	00:28:13	00:28:18	Miranda, I remember being so scared of disappointing my dad.
444	00:28:18	00:28:23	And yet, I was so desperate for other people's attention, I would do anything.
445	00:28:25	00:28:31	You started sneaking out when your dad was away, and you met Carl.
446	00:28:31	00:28:33	And I'm sure the two of you had a really good time.
447	00:28:33	00:28:35	And then, you met another boy.
448	00:28:35	00:28:39	And he was a bad boy, and it was really exciting.
449	00:28:39	00:28:45	And you didn't realize just how dangerous that boy was until it was too late.
450	00:28:45	00:28:49	I know you know what happened to Carl.
451	00:28:49	00:28:55	And I know that you're scared, and you don't know who you're more scared of-- your-your dad or the other boy.
452	00:28:55	00:28:57	But you don't have to be.
453	00:28:57	00:28:59	You just have to tell me the truth.
454	00:29:03	00:29:05	(sighs) I had her.
455	00:29:05	00:29:11	She was this close to talking, and then I lost her; she just went right back into being that scared little girl.
456	00:29:11	00:29:12	Where's this leave us?
457	00:29:12	00:29:16	What about that other kid-- the one you think that killed Carl Abrams-- how do we find him?
458	00:29:16	00:29:18	I think Miranda's still the key.
459	00:29:18	00:29:22	She's a teenage girl who is sneaking out at night, and she's trying to hook up with boys.
460	00:29:22	00:29:25	So if we find out where she's sneaking off to, we find the kid. Exactly.
461	00:29:25	00:29:29	So we have to go back into the bunker, and we have to search it again.
462	00:29:29	00:29:32	We have to look for something, like a diary or-or some clue to her secret life.
463	00:29:33	00:29:35	Like the way you're thinking.
464	00:29:35	00:29:36	Thank you.
465	00:29:36	00:29:37	Oh, boy.
466	00:29:37	00:29:38	What?
467	00:29:38	00:29:41	I think Dad just grounded us.
468	00:29:43	00:29:46	CSI Russell, CSI Finlay, Jill McDermott.
469	00:29:46	00:29:48	Tommy Barnes' attorney. Pleasure.
470	00:29:48	00:29:52	Ms. McDermott is alleging that we violated her client's Fourth Amendment rights.
471	00:29:52	00:29:54	Illegal search and seizure?
472	00:29:54	00:29:56	You're saying we needed a warrant to get in the bunker?
473	00:29:56	00:29:58	Last time I read the Constitution.
474	00:29:58	00:30:01	I was explaining to counsel the exigent circumstances.
475	00:30:01	00:30:04	Your CSIs found blood at the entrance of the bunker.
476	00:30:04	00:30:07	Yes, not to mention that the bunker is on public land.
477	00:30:07	00:30:10	A little preview of how this is gonna play in court.
478	00:30:10	00:30:13	One, I don't buy exigent circumstances.
479	00:30:13	00:30:21	And two, while the Barnes estate generously donated much of its land to the Koval Ridge Reserve, the estate maintains all mineral rights.
480	00:30:21	00:30:25	So everything under the surface is still private property.
481	00:30:25	00:30:28	And any evidence you collected in Mr. Barnes' home gets thrown out.
482	00:30:28	00:30:30	Fruit of the poisonous tree.
483	00:30:30	00:30:38	I think a judge would be reluctant to let you go digging around those roots again. Of course, if you were to release my client now, I'd take that as a good faith gesture.
484	00:30:38	00:30:42	Might discourage me from filing any civil action against the department.
485	00:30:42	00:30:44	I'm sure you all have a lot to discuss.
486	00:30:44	00:30:45	Have a nice night.
487	00:30:47	00:30:48	I know you wanted to get back in that bunker.
488	00:30:48	00:30:52	Yeah. We need a lead to find out where Miranda goes when she meets the mystery kid.
489	00:30:52	00:30:54	Maybe we don't have to go back in there.
490	00:30:54	00:30:56	I'm gonna call Hodges.
491	00:31:10	00:31:13	Hey. That crane speaking to you yet?
492	00:31:13	00:31:17	Whispering. I ran the paper through the VSC, managed to get some detail.
493	00:31:17	00:31:20	Looks like an MRE packaging label.
494	00:31:20	00:31:23	Meals-Ready-to-Eat, as in military fare.
495	00:31:23	00:31:25	Consistent with the Barnes family lifestyle.
496	00:31:25	00:31:29	You know, along the bottom, that looks like a barcode.
497	00:31:29	00:31:31	You know, these days, they encode the shipping destination.
498	00:31:40	00:31:42	Koval Ridge Supply Store.
499	00:31:51	00:31:56	Well, it's not much, but if you live out here, it's your one and only stop shop.
500	00:31:56	00:31:59	And it's the only civilization a girl could find for miles.
501	00:31:59	00:32:02	Good a place as any to meet a guy.
502	00:32:02	00:32:03	What? I've done worse.
503	00:32:10	00:32:13	Whoa.
504	00:32:20	00:32:23	I'm getting a serious feeling of d√©j√† vu here.
505	00:32:23	00:32:25	Yup.
506	00:32:27	00:32:30	Guess now we know where Tommy Barnes got his gear.
507	00:32:30	00:32:33	Yeah, and maybe where our killer did, too.
508	00:32:44	00:32:46	Excuse me.
509	00:32:46	00:32:48	You work here?
510	00:32:48	00:32:51	No, stocking shelves is my hobby.
511	00:32:51	00:32:53	Well, we're, uh, we're with the crime lab.
512	00:32:53	00:32:55	We need to talk to you for a second. What's your name?
513	00:32:55	00:32:58	Luke.
514	00:32:58	00:32:59	Luke. Luke what?
515	00:32:59	00:33:01	Holland.
516	00:33:01	00:33:03	You ever seen that guy?
517	00:33:03	00:33:05	His friend says he comes in here.
518	00:33:05	00:33:08	No. A lot of people come in here.
519	00:33:08	00:33:10	Yeah. I can see that.
520	00:33:10	00:33:12	How about this little girl right here?
521	00:33:12	00:33:13	You ever seen her?
522	00:33:15	00:33:17	Nick.
523	00:33:19	00:33:22	Remember what you said about d√©j√† vu?
524	00:33:24	00:33:25	Is that your stuff, man?
525	00:33:27	00:33:28	Call for backup!
526	00:33:38	00:33:41	Going somewhere, Luke? I didn't do nothing.
527	00:33:41	00:33:43	Innocent people don't run from the police.
528	00:33:44	00:33:46	That's Carl Abrams' bike.
529	00:33:46	00:33:48	Yeah, and I think we just found his killer.
530	00:33:55	00:33:56	We got you, Luke.
531	00:33:56	00:34:00	The blood on the outside of the fatigues was a match to Carl Abrams.
532	00:34:00	00:34:04	And the DNA on the inside is gonna be a match to you.
533	00:34:04	00:34:07	You killed Carl, and you dumped the body.
534	00:34:07	00:34:09	You're wrong.
535	00:34:09	00:34:13	Yeah, I got rid of Carl's body, but I didn't kill him.
536	00:34:13	00:34:16	Then who did? Miranda? I don't know who did it.
537	00:34:16	00:34:19	You're gonna have to do a lot better than that, Luke.
538	00:34:19	00:34:20	Seriously, a lot better.
539	00:34:20	00:34:23	I'm telling you the truth. I swear.
540	00:34:23	00:34:26	I was with Miranda saying good night, and that's when we heard him.
541	00:34:26	00:34:27	Help me.
542	00:34:27	00:34:29	Carl was hurt. Real bad.
543	00:34:29	00:34:32	It was like out of a horror movie.
544	00:34:32	00:34:35	His hand was gone, he was bleeding.
545	00:34:35	00:34:38	There was nothing we could do; he died right there in front of us.
546	00:34:38	00:34:42	I told her I'd take care of it, so I cleaned up.
547	00:34:42	00:34:45	I cut off Carl's other hand, so no one could identify him.
548	00:34:45	00:34:49	I dumped his body on the edge of town and cleared away his campsite.
549	00:34:49	00:34:51	Well, that's a pretty good story, I guess.
550	00:34:51	00:34:54	But think I got a better one.
551	00:34:54	00:34:58	It's not really a... a horror movie.
552	00:34:58	00:35:02	It's... more of a tragic romance.
553	00:35:02	00:35:08	See, I think you killed Carl Abrams because the girl you loved started showering her attention on him, not you.
554	00:35:08	00:35:11	You think I killed Carl over Miranda?
555	00:35:11	00:35:12	Come on.
556	00:35:12	00:35:15	We know about the love triangle.
557	00:35:15	00:35:20	We got Carl's DNA in Miranda's bed and an unknown male.
558	00:35:20	00:35:24	We're not only gonna match the fatigues to you, we're gonna match the sheets.
559	00:35:24	00:35:26	I'm not the one on those sheets.
560	00:35:26	00:35:29	And there's no way...
561	00:35:29	00:35:31	Miranda was with Carl.
562	00:35:31	00:35:33	What are you saying? Miranda's not that kind of girl?
563	00:35:33	00:35:35	No, Carl's not that kind of guy.
564	00:35:35	00:35:37	The dude's got a boyfriend.
565	00:35:37	00:35:44	We all used to hang out together in the bunker when her dad was away. Guess now I know what those boys were up to when they ran off to her room.
566	00:35:44	00:35:47	You're looking at the wrong jealous boyfriend.
567	00:35:47	00:35:49	Carl Abrams' boyfriend got a name?
568	00:35:50	00:35:52	Dylan Trigg.
569	00:35:52	00:35:54	He and Carl were into motocross and camping.
570	00:35:54	00:35:58	That's how Miranda and I first met them-- camping up on Horizon Peak.
571	00:35:58	00:35:59	Yeah.
572	00:35:59	00:36:02	Carl was my boyfriend.
573	00:36:02	00:36:04	Why didn't you say anything about this before?
574	00:36:04	00:36:07	(sighs) I'm not exactly out.
575	00:36:07	00:36:11	Was he out? Carl didn't give a damn about what anybody thought.
576	00:36:11	00:36:12	That include you?
577	00:36:12	00:36:13	Pretty much.
578	00:36:13	00:36:14	Was that a problem?
579	00:36:14	00:36:16	Yeah, it was a problem.
580	00:36:16	00:36:18	Carl didn't get it.
581	00:36:18	00:36:19	It was so easy for him.
582	00:36:19	00:36:24	He said that... if I had any guts, I'd tell people the truth.
583	00:36:24	00:36:26	Is that what you two fought about that night?
584	00:36:28	00:36:29	Do I need a lawyer?
585	00:36:29	00:36:31	I don't know, Dylan.
586	00:36:31	00:36:32	Do you?
587	00:36:35	00:36:38	Hey, I found motorcycle tracks back up on the ridge.
588	00:36:38	00:36:40	They match the tires on Carl's bike.
589	00:36:40	00:36:43	So far, Luke Holland's story's holding up.
590	00:36:43	00:36:45	Let's hope it gets us to the crime scene.
591	00:36:45	00:36:47	I got two sets of shoe impressions.
592	00:36:47	00:36:53	One looks like work boots, and the other has a tread like the shoes we found on Carl Abrams.
593	00:36:53	00:36:55	It's long strides.
594	00:36:55	00:36:57	Carl was running.
595	00:36:57	00:36:59	Looks like...
596	00:36:59	00:37:05	he slowed down around here, stopped, backed up.
597	00:37:06	00:37:09	Right into a bear trap.
598	00:37:12	00:37:15	It's got blood on it, just like Doc Robbins suspected.
599	00:37:15	00:37:18	Mechanism's rusted.
600	00:37:18	00:37:20	Must've broken when it snapped on Carl's leg.
601	00:37:20	00:37:21	That's why he was able to get away.
602	00:37:21	00:37:24	He didn't get very far.
603	00:37:24	00:37:25	I just found Carl's right hand.
604	00:37:28	00:37:29	Buckshot in the wound.
605	00:37:29	00:37:32	Confirms it was a shotgun.
606	00:37:32	00:37:34	Still...
607	00:37:34	00:37:37	there's blood and tissue under his fingernails.
608	00:37:37	00:37:39	We lucked out. Carl got a piece of his killer.
609	00:37:39	00:37:40	You guys don't understand.
610	00:37:40	00:37:42	I loved Carl.
611	00:37:42	00:37:44	I would never hurt him.
612	00:37:44	00:37:46	I'm sure you didn't mean to.
613	00:37:46	00:37:48	You were the one who told us where Carl was camping.
614	00:37:48	00:37:50	You sent us to Koval Ridge.
615	00:37:50	00:37:53	Clearly, you wanted us to discover the truth.
616	00:37:53	00:37:55	I'm sure you feel terrible about what happened.
617	00:37:55	00:37:57	You know there's only one way to make this right.
618	00:38:02	00:38:04	What the hell is going on here?
619	00:38:10	00:38:13	I think I want that lawyer now.
620	00:38:13	00:38:16	Mr. Trigg, this is your son Dylan's confession.
621	00:38:16	00:38:24	He told us that you admitted to assaulting and hunting down Carl Abrams, shooting him and leaving him for dead.
622	00:38:24	00:38:27	My son is lying; I never told him any such thing.
623	00:38:27	00:38:30	Dylan's head is so filled with lies because that...
624	00:38:30	00:38:33	kid, Carl Abrams, messed with him.
625	00:38:33	00:38:37	Screwed him up so he doesn't know who he is or what the truth is anymore.
626	00:38:37	00:38:42	You're right, your son is confused-- because he's had to live a lie.
627	00:38:42	00:38:43	Thanks to you.
628	00:38:43	00:38:45	Think you just made my case in court.
629	00:38:45	00:38:48	This confession isn't worth the paper it's written on.
630	00:38:48	00:38:50	Well, that's why we depend on evidence.
631	00:38:50	00:38:55	This is a tire track found on an access road near the scene of the crime.
632	00:38:55	00:38:57	Matches your truck.
633	00:38:57	00:39:05	Lead trace found in Carl Abrams' wound and pellet size matches the shotgun and the ammunition we found in your home.
634	00:39:05	00:39:11	Don't tell me I'm the only one who uses that ammo. No, but you're the only one that was up on the ridge that night with Carl Abrams.
635	00:39:13	00:39:14	Maybe you recognize...
636	00:39:14	00:39:17	Carl's hand.
637	00:39:17	00:39:21	We found your DNA underneath his fingernails.
638	00:39:21	00:39:23	I guess he must have scratched you.
639	00:39:23	00:39:28	In death, Carl has given us more than enough to convict you.
640	00:39:28	00:39:31	My son is not what that kid tried to make him.
641	00:39:31	00:39:33	I had to protect Dylan.
642	00:39:33	00:39:35	By killing the boy?
643	00:39:35	00:39:37	I told him to stay away; he laughed in my face!
644	00:39:37	00:39:41	He said my son didn't belong to me anymore.
645	00:39:41	00:39:42	That he belonged to him.
646	00:39:42	00:39:44	That Dylan was born to...
647	00:39:46	00:39:48	...to love him.
648	00:39:50	00:39:53	My son was born to be a man.
649	00:39:53	00:39:55	He was.
650	00:39:55	00:39:58	And he proved that when he signed this confession.
651	00:40:09	00:40:10	Dad.
652	00:40:12	00:40:15	I'm so sorry, Dad.
653	00:40:15	00:40:18	It's all my fault.
654	00:40:18	00:40:19	No, no, no, no.
655	00:40:19	00:40:21	I'm just glad you're okay.
656	00:40:21	00:40:25	I knew that the first time I sneaked out.
657	00:40:25	00:40:30	I just-- I saw the campfires and I heard the other kids' voices in the night.
658	00:40:30	00:40:32	I just wanted to be a part of it. It's okay, honey.
659	00:40:32	00:40:36	Every kid wants to explore the world, okay?
660	00:40:36	00:40:40	But that's just it, Dad-- I had a world.
661	00:40:40	00:40:44	You loved me enough to make one for me, and I destroyed it.
662	00:40:44	00:40:46	I've let all the bad in.
663	00:40:46	00:40:50	Because you're right, Dad, that's all there is out there.
664	00:40:50	00:40:53	And when you open the door, that's all that comes in.
665	00:40:53	00:40:56	No, no, no, no, sweetheart, no.
666	00:40:57	00:41:00	I was wrong.
667	00:41:00	00:41:03	See, when I was your age...
668	00:41:03	00:41:05	nothing could hold me back.
669	00:41:05	00:41:08	Everything was possible.
670	00:41:08	00:41:11	And I robbed that from you.
671	00:41:11	00:41:16	When we lost Mom, I kept you from everything and everyone that you knew.
672	00:41:16	00:41:19	Well, the important thing now is where you go from here.
673	00:41:21	00:41:23	Not underground, that's for sure.
674	00:41:23	00:41:25	Dad, are you sure?
675	00:41:25	00:41:27	Yeah, I'm sure.
676	00:41:27	00:41:32	Remember when you asked me if I had any plans for Miranda when she turned 17?
677	00:41:32	00:41:34	Yeah.
678	00:41:34	00:41:37	Well, there's a town up in Oregon where your mom's from.
679	00:41:37	00:41:43	It's this perfect little place-- it's got this quaint little Main Street, everyone knows each other.
680	00:41:43	00:41:45	Sounds like a really, really good idea.
681	00:41:45	00:41:46	It is.
682	00:41:46	00:41:48	Honey, you got family there.
683	00:41:48	00:41:52	I think that's a pretty good place for you to start all over.
684	00:41:52	00:41:53	What do you say?
685	00:42:00	00:42:02	I love you, sweetheart.
686	00:42:02	00:42:05	(sighs) I love you, too, Dad.
