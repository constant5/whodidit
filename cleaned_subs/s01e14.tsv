0	00:00:19	00:00:20	Come on, Sky.
1	00:00:21	00:00:24	Sky, come on.
2	00:00:25	00:00:27	Go get it, Sky!
3	00:00:29	00:00:30	Come on, Sky.
4	00:00:30	00:00:32	Bring it back, Sky.
5	00:00:32	00:00:34	Bring it back, Sky.
6	00:00:34	00:00:36	Good girl.
7	00:00:36	00:00:38	That's not Sky's stick.
8	00:00:38	00:00:40	What do you have here, Sky?
9	00:00:40	00:00:42	Come here, girl.
10	00:00:42	00:00:43	What'd you get, here?
11	00:00:43	00:00:45	What is it, Dad?
12	00:00:45	00:00:53	Nothing... it's just... uh, just an old bone probably from a dead animal or something.
13	00:01:08	00:01:13	It's a tibia... or most of a tibia.
14	00:01:13	00:01:15	How long you think it's been out here?
15	00:01:15	00:01:17	Well, long enough for the animals to pick it clean.
16	00:01:17	00:01:20	And long enough for the elements to have washed away any evidence.
17	00:01:21	00:01:22	Evidence of what?
18	00:01:22	00:01:28	Well, it is a leg bone and my guess is that it didn't walk out here by itself.
19	00:01:28	00:01:30	Well, it could have been a hiker who got lost.
20	00:01:30	00:01:34	It's interesting to me how you always expect the worst.
21	00:01:34	00:01:35	You see, that way, I'm never disappointed.
22	00:01:36	00:01:37	And then sometimes I'm nicely surprised.
23	00:01:37	00:01:39	So, can we call it a crime scene?
24	00:01:39	00:01:40	Potential crime scene.
25	00:01:40	00:01:43	Did you know that there's 206 bones in the human body?
26	00:01:44	00:01:47	Yes, Professor, I, too, took Osteology.
27	00:01:47	00:01:50	Well, 205 more bones and we have a complete skeleton.
28	00:01:50	00:01:55	If we find the rest, then we can determine whether or not it was a murder.
29	00:01:55	00:01:59	Well, I feel it in every one of my 206 bones that this was a murder.
30	00:02:01	00:02:38	[Captioning sponsored by CBS and CBS PRODUCTIONS/ ALLIANCE ATLANTIS] Okay, Catherine and I are on the case from Mount Charleston.
31	00:02:38	00:02:40	Nick, we could use your help on that. Outstanding.
32	00:02:40	00:02:41	So I just talked with the academy.
33	00:02:41	00:02:43	We're getting an entire class of cadets meeting us there.
34	00:02:44	00:02:45	All you guys got to go on is a bone? Mm-hmm.
35	00:02:45	00:02:48	The tibia. Where there's one there's usually another.
36	00:02:48	00:02:52	So, we'll do a grid search and we really could use your friend, Teri Miller.
37	00:02:52	00:02:53	I don't think that's necessary.
38	00:02:53	00:02:54	Well, why not?
39	00:02:54	00:02:58	She's a forensic anthropologist specializes in bones and, hello...
40	00:02:58	00:02:59	all we've got is a bone.
41	00:02:59	00:03:02	I know what she specializes in.
42	00:03:02	00:03:04	If we hit a wall, I'll call her.
43	00:03:04	00:03:06	Okay.
44	00:03:06	00:03:10	Sara, Warrick-- dead body in the Lucky Seven Motel.
45	00:03:10	00:03:13	Is that the place with that weird pool?
46	00:03:13	00:03:18	Maid found dead male body in a hotel room.
47	00:03:18	00:03:20	Any chance it's old age?
48	00:03:20	00:03:23	Guy's 23. No.
49	00:03:23	00:03:26	Sounds like a live one.
50	00:03:26	00:03:27	Let's go.
51	00:03:41	00:03:41	Stop!
52	00:03:50	00:03:51	Looks like a piece of skull bone.
53	00:03:59	00:04:00	What are you doing?
54	00:04:00	00:04:02	Bones are porous.
55	00:04:02	00:04:05	They stick to the tongue.
56	00:04:05	00:04:07	This doesn't stick.
57	00:04:07	00:04:09	It's a piece of rock.
58	00:04:09	00:04:11	I-I hope you had your Hepatitis-B shot.
59	00:04:13	00:04:15	Did you?
60	00:04:29	00:04:32	It could be a piece of wrist bone.
61	00:04:32	00:04:34	Well, do you want to suck it?
62	00:04:34	00:04:36	To be sure?
63	00:04:36	00:04:39	Flag man!
64	00:04:53	00:04:56	Flag!
65	00:05:06	00:05:07	Flag!
66	00:05:32	00:05:36	So... you thinking what I'm thinking?
67	00:05:36	00:05:39	How amazing the universe is.
68	00:05:39	00:05:42	Everything made from the same carbon.
69	00:05:42	00:05:45	Stars to trees, trucks to human bones.
70	00:05:45	00:05:47	Mmm... no.
71	00:05:47	00:05:50	I-I was thinking that we have about 100 bone fragments.
72	00:05:50	00:05:52	We could I.D. this body before the end of the shift.
73	00:05:52	00:05:53	Hmm.
74	00:05:55	00:05:57	Stars and trucks?
75	00:06:16	00:06:18	Only in Vegas.
76	00:06:18	00:06:21	Looks like somebody had a par-tay.
77	00:06:21	00:06:22	Here's the wallet.
78	00:06:22	00:06:24	Couple 20s inside.
79	00:06:25	00:06:27	Darren Pyne.
80	00:06:27	00:06:28	Dead at 23.
81	00:06:28	00:06:30	Sign of struggle.
82	00:06:30	00:06:31	I'll dust for prints.
83	00:06:31	00:06:34	Looks like he was whacked over the head with this lamp.
84	00:06:34	00:06:35	Yeah.
85	00:06:35	00:06:37	One hit or there'd be blood.
86	00:06:37	00:06:41	Unless each hit was to a different part on his dome.
87	00:06:41	00:06:44	Who's the room registered to?
88	00:06:44	00:06:47	Well, you know, that would be Celine Dion.
89	00:06:47	00:06:55	But, uh, the bill was charged to the credit card of a Lynn Henry, Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
90	00:06:56	00:06:57	O'Riley, you think...
91	00:06:57	00:07:00	Right. Find out the last place she used her credit card.
92	00:07:18	00:07:19	I love those shoes.
93	00:07:19	00:07:20	You can wear them again.
94	00:07:20	00:07:22	And we have to get your veil.
95	00:07:22	00:07:23	We have to get your veil.
96	00:07:23	00:07:25	Lynn Henry?
97	00:07:26	00:07:27	You know my name.
98	00:07:27	00:07:29	What's yours?
99	00:07:29	00:07:30	I'm Warrick Brown, and this is Sara Sidle.
100	00:07:31	00:07:31	Hi.
101	00:07:32	00:07:33	We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
102	00:07:33	00:07:34	Crime lab?
103	00:07:34	00:07:36	About what?
104	00:07:36	00:07:39	Darren Pyne was found dead in your motel room at the Lucky Seven.
105	00:07:39	00:07:41	Did you know him?
106	00:07:42	00:07:44	Oh, my God.
107	00:07:44	00:07:45	Yes, I-I do know him.
108	00:07:46	00:07:47	Sort of.
109	00:07:47	00:07:49	Sort of?
110	00:07:49	00:07:52	Uh, we, we gave Meg a bachelorette party last night.
111	00:07:52	00:07:54	We hired a male dancer.
112	00:07:54	00:07:58	I didn't want my fiancÃÂ© to know because he's staying at this hotel.
113	00:07:58	00:08:00	So we rented a room in a sort of out-of-the-way place.
114	00:08:00	00:08:02	So, Darren was the dancer?
115	00:08:02	00:08:05	00?
116	00:08:09	00:08:11	Oh, my God!
117	00:08:12	00:08:13	Whoo!
118	00:08:13	00:08:14	If Steve could see me now.
119	00:08:14	00:08:17	No husbands tonight, ladies.
120	00:08:17	00:08:18	Or fiancÃÂ©s.
121	00:08:29	00:08:30	00, he was totally fine.
122	00:08:30	00:08:32	He was danced out, but definitely alive.
123	00:08:35	00:08:36	He didn't leave when you did?
124	00:08:36	00:08:42	No... uh, he asked if he could stay and the room was already paid for, so I didn't see a problem.
125	00:08:42	00:08:45	Lynn, how did you get those bruises on your wrists?
126	00:08:46	00:08:47	Oh, my God!
127	00:08:49	00:08:51	I-I don't know.
128	00:08:51	00:08:52	I-I was totally tipsy last night.
129	00:08:52	00:08:55	I mean, falling all over everything.
130	00:08:55	00:08:56	All right.
131	00:08:56	00:09:00	We'll probably have more questions after the coroner completes his autopsy.
132	00:09:00	00:09:03	If we need to talk to you can we reach you here?
133	00:09:03	00:09:04	Yes.
134	00:09:04	00:09:06	My wedding is tomorrow.
135	00:09:07	00:09:08	Whatever we can do to help.
136	00:09:08	00:09:10	Thanks.
137	00:09:10	00:09:11	Our card.
138	00:09:49	00:09:50	Ankle bone?
139	00:09:51	00:09:52	Medial malleolous?
140	00:09:52	00:09:55	Goes on the bottom of the tibia?
141	00:09:55	00:09:58	That is correct... according to this book.
142	00:09:58	00:10:01	I'll take toe bones for 200, Alex.
143	00:10:15	00:10:21	All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
144	00:10:21	00:10:22	Hmm.
145	00:10:22	00:10:24	Have we hit a wall yet?
146	00:10:24	00:10:25	No.
147	00:10:25	00:10:28	This was a man, judging by the pelvic bone.
148	00:10:47	00:10:48	Hey, Nicky?
149	00:10:48	00:10:50	Yeah.
150	00:10:50	00:10:53	Let's post this on the Dental Society database-- see if anyone responds.
151	00:11:02	00:11:07	Five times the length of the humerus means this guy was...
152	00:11:07	00:11:09	six feet tall.
153	00:11:09	00:11:13	But we don't know his race and we don't know whether he was right- or left-handed, yet.
154	00:11:13	00:11:17	Well, he was old-- there's some calcification on the rib cartilage.
155	00:11:19	00:11:20	60, 70 years old, maybe.
156	00:11:20	00:11:22	Hmm.
157	00:11:27	00:11:29	Are the bones whispering to you?
158	00:11:37	00:11:39	Look at these jagged marks on the bone.
159	00:11:42	00:11:44	Wait a minute.
160	00:11:46	00:11:48	This guy was chopped up.
161	00:11:48	00:11:49	That's murder.
162	00:11:50	00:11:52	Well, not necessarily.
163	00:11:52	00:11:54	Could have happened postmortem.
164	00:11:54	00:11:57	You know, one of those tractors up in the hills or a mulching machine, maybe.
165	00:11:57	00:11:58	A mulching machine?
166	00:11:58	00:12:01	How long do you plan on ignoring the obvious?
167	00:12:01	00:12:05	A 70-year-old man found in the mountains with clear evidence he was chopped to pieces.
168	00:12:05	00:12:07	That's a... homicide.
169	00:12:07	00:12:10	Well, you should check for hemorrhagic tissue at the bone's tool marks...
170	00:12:12	00:12:12	to be certain.
171	00:12:12	00:12:14	Teri.
172	00:12:14	00:12:15	Hi.
173	00:12:15	00:12:16	Thanks for coming, Teri.
174	00:12:18	00:12:19	I told you I was... calling Teri...
175	00:12:20	00:12:21	...didn't I?
176	00:12:21	00:12:25	Anyway, what were you saying about hemorrhagic tissue?
177	00:12:25	00:12:26	It's blood in the soft tissue.
178	00:12:26	00:12:29	If you find it, it means the guy was alive when he was cut up.
179	00:12:29	00:12:30	Hmm.
180	00:12:30	00:12:33	Well, maybe you two don't need me, after all.
181	00:12:33	00:12:36	I would never turn away a scientist of your talent.
182	00:12:38	00:12:42	Uh, could I have a word with you outside, please?
183	00:12:45	00:12:47	You bring in a specialist without my approval?
184	00:12:48	00:12:52	And you don't bring in one possibly compromise the case, because you two had a relationship?
185	00:12:52	00:12:53	Relationship?
186	00:12:53	00:12:54	I hardly know that woman.
187	00:12:54	00:12:59	Oh... so I guess that dopey look in your eye when she's around is just that.
188	00:12:59	00:13:02	Here's the deal-- we're using Cliff Notes to put that skeleton back together in there.
189	00:13:02	00:13:03	Teri is availing her services.
190	00:13:04	00:13:07	You said she's the best, but hey, if you want me to send her away...
191	00:13:07	00:13:08	Just...
192	00:13:08	00:13:11	check with me about stuff like this, will you?
193	00:13:13	00:13:15	Right.
194	00:13:21	00:13:22	Sorry.
195	00:13:25	00:13:26	So, how'd we do?
196	00:13:26	00:13:28	Not bad.
197	00:13:31	00:13:34	Scaphoid... cuneiform.
198	00:13:34	00:13:39	However, this is a wrist bone and this...
199	00:13:39	00:13:41	is a foot bone.
200	00:13:46	00:13:48	I'm glad you're here.
201	00:13:57	00:14:01	It looks like someone in the Dental Society database saw your posting.
202	00:14:01	00:14:02	Really?
203	00:14:02	00:14:03	Sid Tucker.
204	00:14:03	00:14:04	No way.
205	00:14:04	00:14:06	A local dentist?
206	00:14:06	00:14:08	He has records that go back 30 years.
207	00:14:08	00:14:10	Move over.
208	00:14:13	00:14:17	Hairline fissure of the mandibular canine.
209	00:14:17	00:14:19	Oh, God, why didn't I learn Latin?
210	00:14:19	00:14:25	It's lower level third from the middle.
211	00:14:25	00:14:26	Better memory than you.
212	00:14:27	00:14:29	And...
213	00:14:29	00:14:32	our first character match.
214	00:14:33	00:14:35	Overlapping left incisors.
215	00:14:35	00:14:37	That's the front teeth, right?
216	00:14:37	00:14:38	Two for two.
217	00:14:42	00:14:43	Gold fillings.
218	00:14:43	00:14:45	Well, I know that.
219	00:14:45	00:14:50	He's got gold fillings in adjoining right molars and interspersed in left molars.
220	00:14:50	00:14:53	Tell me this is all we need.
221	00:14:53	00:14:56	Nolan Ryan pitches another perfect game.
222	00:14:56	00:14:58	And the winner is...
223	00:15:00	00:15:01	Mel Bennett.
224	00:15:01	00:15:02	326 Franklin Street.
225	00:15:02	00:15:05	Date of birth September 6, 1931.
226	00:15:05	00:15:08	He was 70.
227	00:15:08	00:15:10	An electric saw? You sure?
228	00:15:10	00:15:13	Grooves from a handsaw would be straight, parallel.
229	00:15:13	00:15:17	Now look at the grooves along the medial condyle of the femur.
230	00:15:17	00:15:19	They're coarse. See?
231	00:15:20	00:15:23	A reciprocating electric saw was used on this person.
232	00:15:24	00:15:26	Excuse me, um, the person's name is Mel Bennett.
233	00:15:26	00:15:27	We just confirmed it.
234	00:15:27	00:15:30	We're going to meet Brass at the widow's house.
235	00:15:30	00:15:31	I got to go. Thank you.
236	00:15:31	00:15:34	Nick, would you stay here and work with Teri on this soft tissue stuff?
237	00:15:34	00:15:36	She'll explain it to you.
238	00:15:36	00:15:37	Sure.
239	00:15:37	00:15:38	Our male dancer.
240	00:15:38	00:15:40	Multiple blows to the head?
241	00:15:40	00:15:41	That's right.
242	00:15:41	00:15:44	And one of those blows did enough damage to cause cranial bleeding.
243	00:15:44	00:15:48	Any of your ladies mention having sex with this victim?
244	00:15:48	00:15:49	No.
245	00:15:49	00:15:51	Just lap dances, nothing more.
246	00:15:51	00:15:54	I think the dance might have been a bit more intimate.
247	00:15:54	00:15:57	Penile swab's back from the lab.
248	00:15:57	00:15:59	Vaginal cells.
249	00:15:59	00:16:01	Looks like fried eggs.
250	00:16:01	00:16:03	That's because the cells are fresh.
251	00:16:03	00:16:06	Darren had sex just before he died.
252	00:16:06	00:16:09	What's the estimated time of death?
253	00:16:09	00:16:11	Midnight.
254	00:16:11	00:16:12	What?!
255	00:16:12	00:16:15	00 a.m.
256	00:16:15	00:16:17	Someone's lying.
257	00:16:20	00:16:23	I don't mean to be snippy but we're already late for my rehearsal dinner.
258	00:16:23	00:16:25	Dinner's going to have to wait.
259	00:16:25	00:16:29	We have forensic proof that Darren Powell had sex with a woman just before he died.
260	00:16:29	00:16:32	And as far as we can tell you were the last three women with him.
261	00:16:32	00:16:34	So, who's lying?
262	00:16:48	00:16:51	I have two small children and a husband.
263	00:16:51	00:16:53	I can't be involved in this.
264	00:16:53	00:16:55	Joyce... shut up.
265	00:16:56	00:16:57	About what?
266	00:16:58	00:17:03	Lynn, does this have anything to do with the bruises on your wrists?
267	00:17:03	00:17:07	Hey, tell us or tell the D.A.
268	00:17:15	00:17:17	Okay.
269	00:17:17	00:17:20	After the bachelorette party, we left.
270	00:17:20	00:17:25	I forgot my purse, so I ran back in to get it.
271	00:17:31	00:17:32	Let go of me. Let go!
272	00:17:33	00:17:34	No!
273	00:17:34	00:17:35	Get off!
274	00:17:35	00:17:37	Oh, no.
275	00:17:37	00:17:41	I told him no, but he just wouldn't take no for an answer.
276	00:17:41	00:17:42	So he raped you.
277	00:17:43	00:17:44	That's how I got the bruises on my wrists.
278	00:17:45	00:17:49	I didn't even tell them until we got back to the hotel.
279	00:17:49	00:17:50	Was Darren alive when you left?
280	00:17:50	00:17:53	Very... unfortunately.
281	00:17:53	00:17:54	So...
282	00:17:55	00:17:56	can we go now?
283	00:17:56	00:17:59	My fiancee is already asking questions.
284	00:17:59	00:18:01	Yeah, you can go, but Lynn, uh...
285	00:18:01	00:18:05	a car's going to take you to the hospital for an exam.
286	00:18:05	00:18:08	An exam for what?
287	00:18:08	00:18:11	It's just standard procedure for sexual assault.
288	00:18:18	00:18:22	Yes? I'm Detective Jim Brass-- Las Vegas Police Department.
289	00:18:22	00:18:23	Are you Mrs. Bennett?
290	00:18:24	00:18:25	Oh, yes.
291	00:18:25	00:18:26	Is this about my car plates?
292	00:18:27	00:18:28	I have them.
293	00:18:28	00:18:30	I just haven't had time to put them on the car.
294	00:18:30	00:18:35	Actually, Mrs. Bennett we're here about your husband, Mel.
295	00:18:35	00:18:39	Oh, well, Mel isn't here right now.
296	00:18:39	00:18:41	Well, do you know where he is?
297	00:18:41	00:18:43	Yes, he's at the store.
298	00:18:45	00:18:46	Is there a problem?
299	00:18:53	00:18:57	Mrs. Bennett, we're going to ask you a few questions down at the station.
300	00:18:57	00:18:58	But I haven't done anything.
301	00:19:00	00:19:02	She looks... distraught.
302	00:19:02	00:19:05	Well, is that because she just found out he's dead or...
303	00:19:05	00:19:08	because she got caught?
304	00:19:10	00:19:15	Interesting how people catalog their lives.
305	00:19:15	00:19:16	50 years of marriage on the wall.
306	00:19:18	00:19:21	Yeah, that's a lot of years.
307	00:19:21	00:19:24	Maybe a few too many for the missus.
308	00:19:24	00:19:25	Oh, I don't know.
309	00:19:25	00:19:29	These two were good with each other.
310	00:19:32	00:19:35	It takes a bad marriage to recognize a good one.
311	00:19:46	00:19:50	Well, not even an aspirin.
312	00:19:54	00:19:55	Look at this.
313	00:19:55	00:19:58	This bathtub hasn't been used lately.
314	00:20:01	00:20:04	Well, maybe she only uses her other bathroom.
315	00:20:12	00:20:17	Tub's the most obvious place to cut up a body but I don't see anything down there.
316	00:20:17	00:20:18	Try phenolphthalein?
317	00:20:19	00:20:22	Give me a swab.
318	00:20:45	00:20:47	Hmm...
319	00:20:52	00:20:53	How'd you guys do?
320	00:20:53	00:20:55	We found blood in the drain.
321	00:20:55	00:20:57	You find anything?
322	00:20:57	00:20:58	Just the murder weapon.
323	00:21:01	00:21:04	Cleaned, in the widow's garage.
324	00:21:11	00:21:13	Bone of a pig.
325	00:21:13	00:21:15	They are the most like humans, as you know.
326	00:21:22	00:21:24	This saw matches the one Brass found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?
327	00:21:25	00:21:26	Exact model.
328	00:21:28	00:21:29	No doubt about it.
329	00:21:29	00:21:36	The marks on this bone are consistent with the marks on Mel Bennett's bones.
330	00:21:36	00:21:38	Exact same electric saw, same blade.
331	00:21:38	00:21:41	Can you tell us anything about the operator?
332	00:21:41	00:21:43	You mean, Mrs. Bennett?
333	00:21:44	00:21:45	Oh, right.
334	00:21:45	00:21:46	Reserve judgment.
335	00:21:46	00:21:51	How someone operates a saw is as telling as how someone operates a pen.
336	00:21:51	00:21:52	Now look at the femur.
337	00:21:53	00:21:58	The skipping marks of a saw over the bone tell us whoever used the saw was unfamiliar with its use.
338	00:22:01	00:22:04	An amateur, if you will.
339	00:22:04	00:22:07	Someone with a weakened nature, compromised musculature.
340	00:22:18	00:22:20	What do you mean, It doesn't add up?
341	00:22:20	00:22:23	Well, we're assuming that a couple of lamp hits to the head killed Darren, right?
342	00:22:23	00:22:24	For now, yeah.
343	00:22:25	00:22:26	You read the Coroner's final report.
344	00:22:26	00:22:29	There's no traces of that lamp on his head at points of impact.
345	00:22:29	00:22:32	Yeah, but maybe the materials didn't adhere.
346	00:22:32	00:22:35	Doesn't mean he wasn't hit in the head with the lamp.
347	00:22:37	00:22:39	What are you looking for?
348	00:22:39	00:22:40	I don't know yet.
349	00:22:40	00:22:42	I'll let you know when I find it.
350	00:22:42	00:22:45	Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
351	00:22:50	00:22:52	What is this?
352	00:22:54	00:22:56	What? What do you got?
353	00:22:56	00:22:58	Some something.
354	00:22:58	00:22:59	Where?
355	00:22:59	00:23:00	Right there.
356	00:23:00	00:23:02	Good job.
357	00:23:19	00:23:21	Tiniest diamond in the world.
358	00:23:21	00:23:23	Oh, you think so, huh?
359	00:23:37	00:23:39	No.
360	00:23:39	00:23:41	Diamonds cut glass.
361	00:23:41	00:23:44	This is some cheap-ass cubic zirconia.
362	00:23:44	00:23:46	The bride-to-be's ring, maybe?
363	00:23:46	00:23:48	She was here.
364	00:23:48	00:23:50	Let's go ask her.
365	00:23:50	00:23:53	Why do you keep asking me these kinds of questions?
366	00:23:54	00:23:56	Well, because someone killed your husband, Mrs. Bennett...
367	00:23:56	00:24:00	and was strong enough to wield an electric saw to do it.
368	00:24:00	00:24:03	But not so strong as to make clean cuts.
369	00:24:05	00:24:07	I didn't kill Mel.
370	00:24:07	00:24:09	I loved him.
371	00:24:09	00:24:11	Why didn't you report him missing?
372	00:24:11	00:24:15	I mean, were you used to him leaving or, did you fight much?
373	00:24:15	00:24:16	Never.
374	00:24:16	00:24:18	Never.
375	00:24:20	00:24:22	We had a perfect marriage.
376	00:24:22	00:24:25	Perfect.
377	00:24:25	00:24:29	And you failed to report him missing for seven months because...?
378	00:24:29	00:24:31	I don't like your tone, young man.
379	00:24:33	00:24:36	Detective, you said I could have an attorney at any time.
380	00:24:36	00:24:38	I think I'd like one now.
381	00:24:38	00:24:39	Oh, sure, Mrs. Bennett, sure.
382	00:24:42	00:24:43	Just sign this form, please.
383	00:24:53	00:24:57	Every time we go to find these girls they're somewhere else.
384	00:24:57	00:24:59	You sure you got that address?
385	00:24:59	00:25:01	The desk clerk was talking very quickly.
386	00:25:01	00:25:03	They talk faster at the sports book.
387	00:25:03	00:25:05	What? In the old days.
388	00:25:05	00:25:06	Oh.
389	00:25:06	00:25:08	You think we're dressed for a wedding?
390	00:25:08	00:25:09	Yeah, not my wedding.
391	00:25:11	00:25:12	What?
392	00:25:12	00:25:14	Lynn Henry's SART exam's in.
393	00:25:17	00:25:19	She lied to us.
394	00:25:19	00:25:22	At this point, I think all those girls are lying to us.
395	00:25:22	00:25:24	All right, let's call Homicide tell them to meet us there.
396	00:25:25	00:25:28	Let's put this to bed before the honeymoon.
397	00:25:48	00:25:51	Sorry, Elvis, the wedding party has to leave the building.
398	00:25:55	00:25:56	( whispers ) What? Oh, my God.
399	00:25:56	00:25:58	What's going on?
400	00:25:58	00:26:01	All three of you ladies are coming in for questioning in the murder of Darren Pyne.
401	00:26:01	00:26:02	Murder?
402	00:26:02	00:26:04	Is this a joke?
403	00:26:04	00:26:06	The clock's going to explain it all, believe me.
404	00:26:06	00:26:08	The, the clock?
405	00:26:08	00:26:11	What, what clock?
406	00:26:13	00:26:14	Hey!
407	00:26:14	00:26:15	Hi.
408	00:26:15	00:26:16	Where you going?
409	00:26:16	00:26:17	I'm leaving.
410	00:26:17	00:26:19	Town?
411	00:26:20	00:26:24	Don't worry, I was able to isolate some soft tissue from the preserved vertebrae.
412	00:26:24	00:26:27	Nick's working on it now.
413	00:26:27	00:26:29	Well, I'm going to go check that out.
414	00:26:29	00:26:30	Teri...
415	00:26:30	00:26:31	you rule.
416	00:26:31	00:26:34	Thanks, Catherine.
417	00:26:34	00:26:36	Well...
418	00:26:36	00:26:39	have a safe trip.
419	00:26:39	00:26:40	Yeah.
420	00:26:42	00:26:46	I-I need to apologize for not returning your call last month.
421	00:26:48	00:26:51	Teri, I admire your dedication to your work.
422	00:26:51	00:26:55	Um, dedication to my work didn't keep me from returning your call.
423	00:26:55	00:26:58	Oh.
424	00:26:59	00:27:01	It, it was nothing.
425	00:27:01	00:27:03	I-I-I just called to see how you were doing.
426	00:27:05	00:27:07	Um... well...
427	00:27:10	00:27:13	Are you still interested in how I'm doing?
428	00:27:15	00:27:17	Of course.
429	00:27:19	00:27:21	So...
430	00:27:21	00:27:24	what's next?
431	00:27:24	00:27:26	Mutilation in the Everglades.
432	00:27:26	00:27:28	Maybe it was just an alligator.
433	00:27:28	00:27:30	Yeah.
434	00:27:30	00:27:32	And if it's not, I'll be filing for a change of address again.
435	00:27:34	00:27:37	Anyway...
436	00:27:37	00:27:38	I got to go.
437	00:27:39	00:27:43	Do you have to go?
438	00:27:43	00:27:44	I mean...
439	00:27:44	00:27:46	couldn't you take a later flight?
440	00:27:46	00:27:48	More bones?
441	00:27:50	00:27:51	Have dinner with me later.
442	00:27:56	00:27:58	I think the bodies will keep.
443	00:28:01	00:28:03	See the tissue?
444	00:28:03	00:28:05	I do.
445	00:28:05	00:28:06	There's no evidence of blood.
446	00:28:07	00:28:08	Yeah.
447	00:28:08	00:28:11	Tells us blood was not pumping through Mel Bennett's veins when he was cut up.
448	00:28:11	00:28:13	Which means he was already dead.
449	00:28:13	00:28:14	Yeah.
450	00:28:14	00:28:16	So, what does that leave us?
451	00:28:16	00:28:18	A spectrum of possibilities.
452	00:28:20	00:28:21	The universe.
453	00:28:21	00:28:25	Leaves me with a Black Widow.
454	00:28:26	00:28:30	We want to thank the crime lab for discovering that Mrs. Bennett's husband was dead when she disassembled him.
455	00:28:30	00:28:32	Disassembled him?
456	00:28:32	00:28:35	So she admits to taking an electric saw to her husband?
457	00:28:35	00:28:37	After he was dead, yes.
458	00:28:37	00:28:40	As you know, in Nevada, there's no law against cutting up a dead body.
459	00:28:40	00:28:42	There's no law saying it's okay, either.
460	00:28:42	00:28:47	Does your client care to tell us how her husband came to be dead?
461	00:28:47	00:28:48	Well, she has no idea.
462	00:28:48	00:28:54	She came home from the grocer's went into the bathroom and there he was in the tub, deceased.
463	00:28:55	00:28:56	No.
464	00:28:56	00:28:59	I-I want to explain.
465	00:29:01	00:29:03	Briefly, Mrs. Bennett.
466	00:29:07	00:29:09	I couldn't afford the burial.
467	00:29:09	00:29:12	So I-I got the saw...
468	00:29:12	00:29:16	and I cut him into manageable pieces.
469	00:29:17	00:29:19	Manageable?
470	00:29:19	00:29:21	Mmm.
471	00:29:23	00:29:27	You made it easier to transport his body?
472	00:29:27	00:29:29	Yeah.
473	00:29:29	00:29:31	To Mount Charleston.
474	00:29:35	00:29:38	I called that whistle-blower's line at the local Treasury office.
475	00:29:38	00:29:40	You know, the one that handles social security fraud?
476	00:29:40	00:29:42	They were happy to help.
477	00:29:47	00:29:49	Well, Mrs. Bennett...
478	00:29:49	00:29:52	can you afford the burial now?
479	00:29:55	00:29:56	What are you talking about?
480	00:29:56	00:30:00	It's her husband's social security checks from the last two years.
481	00:30:00	00:30:03	The signature's the same till seven months ago.
482	00:30:03	00:30:04	Q.D. matched the lady's writing.
483	00:30:04	00:30:09	Mrs. Bennett, you've been cashing your dearly departed's checks, haven't you?
484	00:30:10	00:30:12	And that's fraud.
485	00:30:15	00:30:17	It's also a motive.
486	00:30:17	00:30:21	If you want to alert the Government about some forged social security checks, be my guest.
487	00:30:21	00:30:23	But there's no murder here.
488	00:30:25	00:30:27	We're done.
489	00:30:27	00:30:29	Excuse me.
490	00:30:43	00:30:50	Typical Vegas wife-- offs her old man for the money and there's nothing we can do about it.
491	00:30:50	00:30:51	We have to go back to the body.
492	00:30:51	00:30:52	Right.
493	00:30:53	00:30:56	There's always a clue except we don't have a body.
494	00:30:56	00:30:59	We have bones.
495	00:31:11	00:31:13	I'll take it to Greg.
496	00:31:13	00:31:16	Skeletal muscle of Mel Bennett.
497	00:31:16	00:31:17	It goes in...
498	00:31:24	00:31:25	Contents come out.
499	00:31:25	00:31:29	In 30 seconds-- Bioassay.
500	00:31:29	00:31:30	I like saying that word.
501	00:31:30	00:31:32	Bioassay.
502	00:31:32	00:31:33	Sounds Nubian.
503	00:31:33	00:31:34	So how are you?
504	00:31:34	00:31:36	Never better.
505	00:31:36	00:31:38	Yeah? Well, you look good.
506	00:31:38	00:31:39	I try.
507	00:31:39	00:31:41	Yeah. I heard Grissom's lady friend was in town.
508	00:31:41	00:31:43	Lady friend? Hmm. Wouldn't know anything about that.
509	00:31:43	00:31:45	Really? I thought you and Grissom were tight.
510	00:31:45	00:31:47	We are. ( machine noise )
511	00:31:47	00:31:49	Okay. Got it. Private.
512	00:31:54	00:31:56	Huh. Digoxin.
513	00:31:56	00:31:58	Digoxin?
514	00:31:58	00:32:03	It's supposed to treat heart failure but not if you're taking the amount found in Mel Bennett's bones.
515	00:32:03	00:32:05	She poisoned him.
516	00:32:07	00:32:09	Someone did.
517	00:32:15	00:32:17	We know your husband had an overdose in his system.
518	00:32:19	00:32:22	We found it in his bone tissue.
519	00:32:22	00:32:26	Did you kill him for his pension checks?
520	00:32:26	00:32:27	Don't answer that question.
521	00:32:27	00:32:28	It's okay.
522	00:32:28	00:32:31	Mel took those pills himself.
523	00:32:32	00:32:36	He asked me to leave the house so he could do it.
524	00:32:36	00:32:37	So, now it's suicide.
525	00:32:38	00:32:41	He was dying from the heart trouble.
526	00:32:41	00:32:43	He was in chronic pain.
527	00:32:43	00:32:45	He asked me to get it over with.
528	00:32:45	00:32:47	I couldn't.
529	00:32:47	00:32:50	I loved him.
530	00:32:52	00:32:54	This is the part that I'm having a hard time with.
531	00:32:54	00:33:00	You were able to cut him up when you realized you couldn't afford the burial.
532	00:33:00	00:33:04	I lied about why.
533	00:33:04	00:33:05	Mrs. Bennett, don't... No.
534	00:33:06	00:33:07	Let me talk.
535	00:33:07	00:33:15	Mel made me promise to hide his body so I wouldn't lose his social security benefits.
536	00:33:15	00:33:20	Because a wife's benefits are cut in half when the husband dies.
537	00:33:20	00:33:21	Yes.
538	00:33:21	00:33:30	Even if you've spent 50 years by his side-- packing his lunch pressing his work pants.
539	00:33:30	00:33:34	Mel was my whole life.
540	00:33:34	00:33:37	I didn't kill him.
541	00:33:37	00:33:42	I couldn't even put him out of his misery.
542	00:33:49	00:33:52	So what do you think, Jim?
543	00:33:52	00:33:53	I don't know. You're the lab guys.
544	00:33:53	00:33:54	What is the evidence telling you?
545	00:33:55	00:34:00	Forensically, we can't prove if Mel took the digoxin overdose or if she forced it on him.
546	00:34:00	00:34:02	So that leaves us with one choice.
547	00:34:02	00:34:05	Equivocal evidence.
548	00:34:05	00:34:06	Golden rule.
549	00:34:06	00:34:08	Ah.
550	00:34:08	00:34:14	Well, When faced with evidence that can equally exonerate or implicate a suspect, we must as objective interpreters of that evidence...
551	00:34:14	00:34:16	side with the defendant.
552	00:34:16	00:34:18	Tie goes to the brother.
553	00:34:18	00:34:20	Rose goes free.
554	00:34:20	00:34:22	We'll never prove who administered the fatal dose.
555	00:34:23	00:34:26	I don't think she did it.
556	00:34:26	00:34:28	Okay, then.
557	00:34:28	00:34:29	I guess I'm out of here.
558	00:34:29	00:34:31	I'll go start my paperwork.
559	00:34:31	00:34:34	See you.
560	00:34:34	00:34:36	Okay, so, I was wrong.
561	00:34:36	00:34:37	It wasn't murder.
562	00:34:37	00:34:39	It's not a contest.
563	00:34:39	00:34:41	You want to go in with me?
564	00:34:41	00:34:43	Give her the good news?
565	00:34:43	00:34:44	Could you do it?
566	00:34:44	00:34:47	I'm sort of late for a dinner.
567	00:34:47	00:34:49	Sure.
568	00:34:49	00:34:52	Thanks.
569	00:35:06	00:35:12	So, ladies of the wedding party, you get a free course in the forensics of sexual intercourse.
570	00:35:12	00:35:13	Secrets of our trade.
571	00:35:13	00:35:19	Lynn, when you had your exam for sexual assault a SART nurse makes a chart like this.
572	00:35:23	00:35:25	This is the vagina.
573	00:35:27	00:35:29	And it does tell a monologue.
574	00:35:29	00:35:33	Some bruising is normal when sex occurs.
575	00:35:33	00:35:35	Injuries at 11...
576	00:35:35	00:35:41	00, indicate consensual sex or what we would call avid.
577	00:35:41	00:35:43	Injuries around the dinner hour...
578	00:35:43	00:35:48	Five, six, or seven, indicate forced entry.
579	00:35:48	00:35:52	The woman hasn't done anything to help her partner thus sustaining serious bruising.
580	00:35:52	00:35:56	Sidle, I'm going to be just outside the door.
581	00:35:56	00:35:58	Okay, O'Riley.
582	00:36:00	00:36:02	Lynn...
583	00:36:02	00:36:07	Your exam showed no evidence of sex in the last 48 hours.
584	00:36:07	00:36:08	Actually, in months.
585	00:36:12	00:36:16	But the epithelials indicate that Darren had sex right before he died.
586	00:36:16	00:36:21	And the coroner puts time of death when you've all admitted to being present.
587	00:36:21	00:36:23	So...
588	00:36:23	00:36:25	Meg?
589	00:36:26	00:36:28	Joyce?
590	00:36:32	00:36:35	Look, we can run the clock exam on each of you.
591	00:36:35	00:36:38	And the clock is going to tell us what happened.
592	00:36:40	00:36:42	So who wants to go first?
593	00:36:45	00:36:49	I had sex with Darren.
594	00:36:51	00:36:54	And it wasn't rape.
595	00:36:54	00:37:05	Darren had been flirting with me all night and when it was time to leave I told the other girls to wait in the car.
596	00:37:05	00:37:10	I know it's crazy but I thought...
597	00:37:10	00:37:12	I'm in Vegas.
598	00:37:12	00:37:14	It doesn't really count.
599	00:37:25	00:37:26	And...
600	00:37:26	00:37:30	Then I don't know what happened.
601	00:37:30	00:37:33	I saw my engagement ring.
602	00:37:33	00:37:41	Then I-I thought about Luke and how he trusts me.
603	00:37:41	00:37:43	I don't think this is right.
604	00:37:43	00:37:44	Oh, you like it a little rough.
605	00:37:44	00:37:46	I tried to push Darren of me... Okay.
606	00:37:46	00:37:48	We can do that.
607	00:37:48	00:37:50	But I-I don't think it got through.
608	00:37:50	00:37:53	He wouldn't stop.
609	00:37:55	00:37:58	As soon as I hit him with the lamp, I knew.
610	00:37:58	00:38:01	So you only hit him once?
611	00:38:01	00:38:04	Mm-hmm.
612	00:38:08	00:38:12	I didn't mean to kill him.
613	00:38:12	00:38:15	Meg, your engagement ring...
614	00:38:15	00:38:18	Is that a cubic zirconia?
615	00:38:18	00:38:21	No, it's a real diamond.
616	00:38:21	00:38:25	My fiancÃÂ© wanted me to have the best.
617	00:38:27	00:38:29	Does your fiancÃÂ© have a zirconia ring?
618	00:38:29	00:38:32	Zirconia studded.
619	00:38:34	00:38:36	It's a promise ring.
620	00:38:36	00:38:41	He told me to save my money...
621	00:38:41	00:38:43	for our honeymoon.
622	00:38:47	00:38:48	Damaged?
623	00:38:48	00:38:50	No, my ring is fine.
624	00:38:50	00:38:51	May we see it?
625	00:39:03	00:39:05	You were in that motel room that night, weren't you, Luke?
626	00:39:05	00:39:07	I don't know what you're talking about.
627	00:39:07	00:39:09	What happened? You got wind of the party?
628	00:39:10	00:39:12	I don't know where she is.
629	00:39:12	00:39:13	Let her go!
630	00:39:13	00:39:14	Your husband told me you were here.
631	00:39:14	00:39:15	Now tell me where she is.
632	00:39:15	00:39:16	Let go of me.
633	00:39:17	00:39:18	Just give me the room number.
634	00:39:18	00:39:19	Tell me where she is.
635	00:39:19	00:39:22	Bruised up Lynn's wrists.
636	00:39:24	00:39:27	Meg, you did have sex with Darren the dancer.
637	00:39:27	00:39:30	Maybe you even tried to stop in the middle of it.
638	00:39:30	00:39:32	But something got your attention.
639	00:39:32	00:39:36	I don't think this is right.
640	00:39:36	00:39:38	Oh, my God!
641	00:39:38	00:39:39	Luke.
642	00:39:42	00:39:46	Luke, you threw the lamp-- probably on the floor.
643	00:39:46	00:39:48	Understandable rage.
644	00:39:49	00:39:52	You did what any guy in your position would do.
645	00:39:53	00:39:56	But you didn't stop with one hit.
646	00:40:01	00:40:05	And you didn't know that you had lost a piece of your ring.
647	00:40:07	00:40:08	Except we found it.
648	00:40:16	00:40:19	Honey, I'm sorry.
649	00:40:26	00:40:27	We just...
650	00:40:27	00:40:30	We just were hoping we could get married.
651	00:40:30	00:40:33	Put it all behind us.
652	00:40:39	00:40:43	Laws don't end when you come to Vegas.
653	00:41:05	00:41:08	I'm surprised.
654	00:41:08	00:41:10	I'm having a nice time.
655	00:41:10	00:41:12	Were you expecting a bad time?
656	00:41:12	00:41:18	No. I just thought we might be uncomfortable away from work.
657	00:41:18	00:41:21	Are you?
658	00:41:23	00:41:25	No.
659	00:41:26	00:41:28	Nor am I.
660	00:41:28	00:41:29	Good.
661	00:41:29	00:41:31	It's kind of like that old saying.
662	00:41:31	00:41:32	How a person does one thing is...
663	00:41:32	00:41:34	...how a person does everything.
664	00:41:34	00:41:35	Exactly.
665	00:41:41	00:41:43	Excuse me. Sure.
666	00:41:52	00:41:54	What's going on?
667	00:41:56	00:42:00	They found two bodies in a crack den at the end of the strip.
668	00:42:00	00:42:03	Evidently, they've been dead a while.
669	00:42:03	00:42:07	They need me to do an insect analysis ASAP.
670	00:42:07	00:42:09	Oh.
671	00:42:11	00:42:13	Well...
672	00:42:13	00:42:15	you are the bug guy.
673	00:42:15	00:42:18	Yeah.
674	00:42:20	00:42:23	But I asked you to postpone your flight.
675	00:42:23	00:42:26	It's okay.
676	00:42:26	00:42:28	It happens.
677	00:42:30	00:42:32	Maybe I can...
678	00:42:37	00:42:39	I'm sorry.
679	00:42:43	00:42:44	Yeah. Grissom.
680	00:42:44	00:42:47	All right, look...
681	00:42:47	00:42:55	make sure the paramedics don't leave and have the primary on the scene take photographs of the corpses at two minute intervals until I arrive.
682	00:42:55	00:42:57	All right?
