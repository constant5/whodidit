0	00:00:12	00:00:13	Ready 11.
1	00:00:13	00:00:15	25 seconds to air.
2	00:00:15	00:00:18	T.O.C., we should have Ella up on the strip.
3	00:00:18	00:00:19	Signal looks good. 20 seconds.
4	00:00:19	00:00:24	Tell Rainy that we're gonna stick with Theresa for the first segment, so no Storm Center till after the bump.
5	00:00:26	00:00:29	Ten seconds to air. Put Denny on standby to warm up her green screen lights.
6	00:00:29	00:00:30	Okay.
7	00:00:30	00:00:32	Five seconds. Why don't I see Theresa?
8	00:00:32	00:00:37	Because my boy Friday doesn't understand the difference between lipstick and lip liner.
9	00:00:37	00:00:41	Tonight, on KVKC News DIRECTOR with Theresa Shea...
10	00:00:41	00:00:42	Ready one. That's not fair.
11	00:00:42	00:00:44	You specifically said you wanted...
12	00:00:44	00:00:45	Chad, get Theresa some coffee.
13	00:00:45	00:00:47	(snaps fingers) Light cream.
14	00:00:47	00:00:48	Truvia, specifically.
15	00:00:48	00:00:51	Chad, now.
16	00:00:51	00:00:54	Move two to apple six.
17	00:00:54	00:00:55	...Las Vegas.
18	00:00:55	00:00:57	go one.
19	00:00:57	00:00:59	00.
20	00:00:59	00:01:01	I'm Theresa Shea.
21	00:01:01	00:01:03	Our top story is a torrential rain hitting the city.
22	00:01:03	00:01:04	Ready two.
23	00:01:04	00:01:05	Open up Ella, REM 17.
24	00:01:05	00:01:09	On the scene in the eye of the storm is our own fearless Ella St. James.
25	00:01:09	00:01:11	Go REM 17.
26	00:01:11	00:01:13	Ella, how's it look out there?
27	00:01:13	00:01:17	Uh, Theresa, I'm having trouble hearing you, so let me just report what I know.
28	00:01:17	00:01:20	The storm has picked up and is getting worse, Come on, come on.
29	00:01:20	00:01:23	with wind speeds increasing up to 80 miles per hour.
30	00:01:23	00:01:24	Ella?
31	00:01:24	00:01:25	Can't hear you, so if you...
32	00:01:25	00:01:27	Theresa, pull it back. Go three.
33	00:01:27	00:01:30	Thanks, Ella.
34	00:01:30	00:01:32	We'll try to get that sound sorted out.
35	00:01:32	00:01:36	We'd like to remind everyone that it's best to stay indoors for the next few hours.
36	00:01:39	00:01:41	It's like amateur hour tonight.
37	00:01:41	00:01:43	Theresa, just bear with us a second.
38	00:01:43	00:01:44	Can someone tell me what the hell is going on?
39	00:01:44	00:01:46	House lights are out, overheads as well.
40	00:01:46	00:01:49	No monitors, camera servers are down.
41	00:01:49	00:01:50	We're blacked out.
42	00:01:50	00:01:52	Denny, tell me you're on it, brother.
43	00:01:52	00:01:54	I am. Hopefully the generator out back will kick in soon.
44	00:01:55	00:01:59	Theresa, you still okay in there?
45	00:01:59	00:02:01	Theresa, you still there?
46	00:02:04	00:02:06	I think we're back.
47	00:02:06	00:02:07	Theresa, you okay?
48	00:02:12	00:02:14	Go to a commercial. Go to a commercial!
49	00:02:20	00:02:22	Looks a lot bigger on TV.
50	00:02:22	00:02:25	This your newscast of choice?
51	00:02:25	00:02:26	I like watching them all.
52	00:02:26	00:02:29	Like a little mini documentary on the city every night.
53	00:02:29	00:02:30	Hey.
54	00:02:30	00:02:33	Detective Vartann, what's our top story tonight?
55	00:02:33	00:02:35	Theresa Shea, the most trusted name in news.
56	00:02:35	00:02:37	Alive when the power went out.
57	00:02:37	00:02:41	20 seconds later, the lights come back on, and she falls dead onto the news desk.
58	00:02:41	00:02:43	Well, somebody in here must have seen something.
59	00:02:43	00:02:45	Sound person, camera guy?
60	00:02:45	00:02:46	Cameramen don't exist anymore.
61	00:02:46	00:02:49	Cameras are all robots, operated from the control rooms.
62	00:02:49	00:02:50	Sound and lighting, too.
63	00:02:50	00:02:52	Newsrooms have gone the way of gas stations.
64	00:02:52	00:02:56	Great, got a locked room mystery, with a million viewers.
65	00:02:56	00:02:59	Come on over here.
66	00:02:59	00:03:01	This is Denny Jones; he's the studio lighting tech.
67	00:03:01	00:03:03	I didn't know if you wanted the house lights up or not.
68	00:03:03	00:03:06	Denny, can you get the lights back to these exact settings?
69	00:03:06	00:03:07	Push of a button.
70	00:03:07	00:03:08	Turn up the sun.
71	00:03:08	00:03:10	Let's go.
72	00:03:10	00:03:12	What's the rest of the team doing tonight?
73	00:03:12	00:03:14	Finn is finishing a fire investigation.
74	00:03:14	00:03:16	Life coach or something like that.
75	00:03:16	00:03:18	Walking on coals gone horribly wrong?
76	00:03:18	00:03:19	Probably.
77	00:03:19	00:03:23	Greg and Morgan are pushing paper, and Nick's on a B and E.
78	00:03:31	00:03:35	Okay, call him and tell him to lock in chain of custody.
79	00:03:35	00:03:37	I want all hands on deck.
80	00:03:40	00:03:43	if it bleeds, it leads.
81	00:04:20	00:04:23	Looks like there's only the one injury.
82	00:04:23	00:04:25	Single puncture wound to the back of the neck.
83	00:04:25	00:04:27	The shape suggests a knife.
84	00:04:27	00:04:29	Killer was either lucky or good.
85	00:04:29	00:04:31	He hit the perfect spot to kill her.
86	00:04:31	00:04:38	When we dissected frogs in high school biology, you'd pith it by sticking a pin right here.
87	00:04:38	00:04:40	The frog would get all...
88	00:04:40	00:04:43	None of the girls in class wanted to do it, so they asked me to.
89	00:04:43	00:04:46	I became known as the designated pither.
90	00:04:46	00:04:48	I would have gone with relief pither.
91	00:04:48	00:04:50	That's better.
92	00:04:50	00:04:52	David, can you, um, sit her up for me one more time?
93	00:04:52	00:04:54	I want to get some context. Yeah.
94	00:05:01	00:05:06	Spatter suggests the killer came from the left.
95	00:05:06	00:05:08	Plunged the knife in the back of her neck.
96	00:05:10	00:05:15	Directional blood drops tell me he took off to the right in a hurry.
97	00:05:15	00:05:19	If this was a pithing, this was a drive-by pithing.
98	00:05:25	00:05:29	I know where I'm watching the next Seahawks game.
99	00:05:29	00:05:31	CSI Russell? Yeah?
100	00:05:31	00:05:33	Fred Paulsen, executive producer.
101	00:05:33	00:05:35	Hey. Hey, how are you?
102	00:05:35	00:05:38	22 years of covering crime, I never figured it would hit this close to home.
103	00:05:38	00:05:40	Can you give us a sense of what happened?
104	00:05:40	00:05:44	Um, we were cutting back from our field reporter, and the lights went out.
105	00:05:44	00:05:45	You mean the power.
106	00:05:45	00:05:47	No, the power here is compartmentalized.
107	00:05:47	00:05:49	There's battery backup for all the electronics.
108	00:05:49	00:05:51	The lights reroute through a generator out back.
109	00:05:51	00:05:54	And it took 20 seconds for the backup generator to kick in, right?
110	00:05:54	00:05:56	During which time, we were all in the dark.
111	00:05:56	00:05:58	No light means no eyewitnesses.
112	00:05:58	00:06:00	Makes a murder case a little tougher to crack.
113	00:06:00	00:06:02	Right, but every murder needs three things, right?
114	00:06:02	00:06:04	Means, motive, opportunity.
115	00:06:04	00:06:06	We have a low threshold on means.
116	00:06:06	00:06:07	Victim sustained a sharp-force injury.
117	00:06:07	00:06:09	Anyone can get their hands on something sharp.
118	00:06:09	00:06:11	Okay, let's talk about motive.
119	00:06:11	00:06:14	You have any idea who would want to see Theresa Shea dead?
120	00:06:14	00:06:16	Sure.
121	00:06:18	00:06:19	You could start right there.
122	00:06:19	00:06:20	What's this?
123	00:06:20	00:06:21	Our crew list.
124	00:06:21	00:06:24	Theresa was not the easiest person to work with.
125	00:06:24	00:06:26	Well, that leaves opportunity.
126	00:06:26	00:06:28	Which would narrow down this list.
127	00:06:28	00:06:32	So, lights were out for 20 seconds, right?
128	00:06:32	00:06:35	Who would have been close enough to kill her in that window of time?
129	00:06:35	00:06:39	Plausibly, three of my people would've been in that vicinity.
130	00:06:39	00:06:43	Okay, well, I've got three people.
131	00:06:43	00:06:46	Let's go with man-to-man coverage.
132	00:06:49	00:06:54	Paulsen told me they wouldn't need me until the next segment, so I stayed here, monitoring the Doppler.
133	00:06:54	00:06:55	For the monsoon?
134	00:06:55	00:06:57	Monsoons only happen between May and August.
135	00:06:57	00:06:59	Technically, this was a training.
136	00:06:59	00:07:00	A training?
137	00:07:00	00:07:06	Two storms hitting at the same time, upping the volume of precipitation, creating a flash flood.
138	00:07:06	00:07:07	That's very impressive.
139	00:07:07	00:07:13	Masters in meteorology and atmospheric sciences, and I've got the student loans to prove it.
140	00:07:13	00:07:14	Rainy, do they make you wear that?
141	00:07:14	00:07:19	I mean, wouldn't you want to dress a little bit more conservatively?
142	00:07:19	00:07:21	Well, if I did, I'd be at home watching the girl who didn't.
143	00:07:21	00:07:24	And my real name's not Rainy.
144	00:07:24	00:07:26	It's a cutthroat business.
145	00:07:26	00:07:30	Well, any idea who may have wanted to cut Theresa's throat?
146	00:07:30	00:07:31	Or neck?
147	00:07:31	00:07:33	Top of my list would be Ella.
148	00:07:33	00:07:34	Ella. Mm-hmm.
149	00:07:34	00:07:37	Is she the field reporter?
150	00:07:37	00:07:41	Well, Paulsen was grooming Ella to take over the anchor desk.
151	00:07:41	00:07:45	But the most trusted bitch in news was not going to go quietly into that night.
152	00:07:45	00:07:48	So Ella had the most to gain if Theresa was out of the way.
153	00:07:48	00:07:50	Where was she at the time of the murder?
154	00:07:50	00:07:52	Giving a report clear across town.
155	00:07:52	00:07:54	Well, that's a pretty good alibi.
156	00:07:54	00:07:57	But in all honesty, it could be anyone.
157	00:07:57	00:08:00	Theresa could be brutal.
158	00:08:01	00:08:03	So she's really dead?
159	00:08:03	00:08:04	Did you get her broomstick as proof?
160	00:08:04	00:08:07	You don't seem very broken up about it.
161	00:08:07	00:08:10	That woman made everyone's life a living hell, but my life was her favorite target.
162	00:08:10	00:08:13	So, Chad, where were you when the lights went out?
163	00:08:13	00:08:16	I was getting her her coffee, light cream, Truvia.
164	00:08:16	00:08:19	I was at the vending machine, right there.
165	00:08:19	00:08:21	How'd you pay for it?
166	00:08:21	00:08:22	Credit card.
167	00:08:22	00:08:23	Why?
168	00:08:23	00:08:25	Might have a time-date stamp.
169	00:08:25	00:08:27	I'll need the number to verify.
170	00:08:27	00:08:31	I'd also like to check out the sharp objects that you carry around for work.
171	00:08:34	00:08:36	Take your pick.
172	00:08:38	00:08:42	You've got a lot of sharp tools here, Denny.
173	00:08:42	00:08:45	My job involves a fair amount of cutting.
174	00:08:45	00:08:48	Wire, cable, carpet, tape.
175	00:08:48	00:08:50	Each requires a different blade.
176	00:08:50	00:08:53	I'm gonna need to take a swab of your hands.
177	00:08:53	00:08:54	What does a swab do?
178	00:08:54	00:08:57	We use it to find blood.
179	00:09:02	00:09:04	You think I might have stabbed Theresa.
180	00:09:07	00:09:09	You're on the list.
181	00:09:09	00:09:11	I guess that makes sense.
182	00:09:19	00:09:21	No blood.
183	00:09:23	00:09:25	So...
184	00:09:25	00:09:30	if you were to stab somebody, what would you use?
185	00:09:37	00:09:38	Nothing here.
186	00:09:38	00:09:41	Something with a heftier handle so that you can...
187	00:09:45	00:09:46	Sorry, I didn't mean to...
188	00:09:46	00:09:49	What do you do here, Denny?
189	00:09:49	00:09:54	Lighting, simple I.T. work, and, um...
190	00:09:54	00:09:56	Listen, you gonna need anything else from me?
191	00:09:56	00:09:58	No, I'm good.
192	00:10:01	00:10:04	Thank you.
193	00:10:04	00:10:05	Theresa.
194	00:10:05	00:10:10	Was she in pain when it happened, when... when the knife went in?
195	00:10:10	00:10:13	I don't know.
196	00:11:01	00:11:06	Hey, uh, I think some of the power's still out there, bud.
197	00:11:06	00:11:07	No, only in the main circuit.
198	00:11:07	00:11:11	Garage runs on a feed that's divorced from the rest of the station.
199	00:11:11	00:11:17	Say, you sure do seem to know a lot about the electrical workings of the building.
200	00:11:17	00:11:18	What's your name?
201	00:11:18	00:11:22	Robbie. It's kind of my job to.
202	00:11:22	00:11:23	Uh, who are you?
203	00:11:23	00:11:25	I'm Nick Stokes with the crime lab.
204	00:11:25	00:11:28	Hi. Um, is it true about Theresa?
205	00:11:28	00:11:29	Murder?
206	00:11:29	00:11:33	Yes, ma'am, it is. We drove back as soon as we heard what happened.
207	00:11:33	00:11:37	News vans from our competition are already gathered in front of the station. Vultures.
208	00:11:37	00:11:39	And how well did you two know Ms. Shea?
209	00:11:39	00:11:42	I'm not sure anyone really knew her.
210	00:11:42	00:11:44	She kept the world at arm's length.
211	00:11:44	00:11:45	Saw everyone as a threat.
212	00:11:45	00:11:51	Would you mind giving us a quick interview about this investigation? If you could do that yes, ma'am thing again, that would be great.
213	00:11:51	00:11:53	Robbie, could you get out the camera...
214	00:11:53	00:11:56	No. Actually, I would mind. Sorry.
215	00:11:56	00:12:00	I know it seems callous, but it is my job.
216	00:12:00	00:12:04	Well, it is my job to process the crime scene... ma'am.
217	00:12:04	00:12:08	But if we need anything else, we'll be sure to be in touch, okay?
218	00:12:08	00:12:11	Okay. Right.
219	00:12:34	00:12:36	Cheek implants?
220	00:12:36	00:12:42	This poor woman was fighting the war against aging one cosmetic procedure at a time.
221	00:12:42	00:12:45	Scarring and thread from multiple facelifts.
222	00:12:45	00:12:49	Forehead presents immobile musculature suggesting Botox.
223	00:12:49	00:12:51	Lip and wrinkle fillers, you name it.
224	00:12:51	00:12:54	When your looks are married to your career, it's job security, I suppose.
225	00:12:56	00:12:57	C.O.D.?
226	00:12:57	00:12:59	Severed brain stem.
227	00:12:59	00:13:04	Knife wound hit right between the occipital bone of the skull and atlas, C1.
228	00:13:04	00:13:13	Spinal cord was transected at the level of the medulla oblongata, effectively disconnecting the transmission of signals between the brain and the body.
229	00:13:13	00:13:15	So not just lucky, good.
230	00:13:15	00:13:17	Yeah.
231	00:13:17	00:13:18	Any idea of the murder weapon?
232	00:13:18	00:13:22	We did find bruising at the entrance of the wound.
233	00:13:22	00:13:27	You know, it kind of looks like one of those guards that you see on folding utility knives.
234	00:13:27	00:13:29	It's a single-edged blade and a sharp one at that.
235	00:13:29	00:13:32	Some sort of viscous green paste in the wound track?
236	00:13:32	00:13:33	Any idea what that is?
237	00:13:33	00:13:36	Well, it is not biological.
238	00:13:36	00:13:39	Looks like a job for David Hodges.
239	00:13:46	00:13:48	Hello, Russell.
240	00:13:48	00:13:56	Hey. I've been following the dedicated power line that goes between Nevada Flats Power and KVKC, trying to figure out why the power went out.
241	00:13:56	00:13:59	Oh. You finding anything interesting?
242	00:13:59	00:14:01	It's more about what I didn't find.
243	00:14:01	00:14:05	Transformer about a quarter mile from the station got blown to bits.
244	00:14:05	00:14:09	Well, those transformers can be volatile, particularly in wet weather.
245	00:14:09	00:14:10	Maybe it was some sort of a malfunction.
246	00:14:10	00:14:16	Yeah, well, that's what I thought at first, too, but then I found remains of explosive material in the debris.
247	00:14:16	00:14:18	Hold on a second, will ya?
248	00:14:29	00:14:31	Oh, yeah, I just found parts of a cell phone.
249	00:14:31	00:14:33	This is definitely not an accident.
250	00:14:33	00:14:35	So this murder wasn't a crime of opportunity.
251	00:14:35	00:14:36	No, no, no.
252	00:14:36	00:14:40	This was patient. This was planned.
253	00:14:50	00:14:52	What kind of device are we looking at?
254	00:14:52	00:14:56	Well, I got some nitroglycerine and some wax paper.
255	00:14:56	00:14:59	Figuring the former was wrapped in the latter.
256	00:14:59	00:15:02	You got to know an awful lot about explosives to mess with dynamite.
257	00:15:02	00:15:06	So we're looking for someone in construction, demolition, ex-military.
258	00:15:06	00:15:07	Cell phone.
259	00:15:07	00:15:11	Cheap-looking components. Could be a burner.
260	00:15:11	00:15:12	Remote detonator?
261	00:15:12	00:15:14	Welcome to the hurt locker.
262	00:15:14	00:15:19	As long as the phone has enough juice, the device can sit and wait.
263	00:15:19	00:15:21	Until it gets a call to action.
264	00:15:26	00:15:28	Well, why don't I take the phone.
265	00:15:28	00:15:31	Maybe I'll get lucky and be able to pull a print or two.
266	00:15:31	00:15:37	I'll see if I can salvage some date/shift code from the remnants of the dynamite paper.
267	00:16:14	00:16:18	Hey, Hodges, got anything on the coffee cup Nick found in the garage? I do.
268	00:16:18	00:16:23	Aside from a bold French roast, I found trace of water, salt and urea.
269	00:16:23	00:16:25	Someone peed in Theresa's cup?
270	00:16:25	00:16:28	Or they're test-marketing a horrible new nondairy sweetener.
271	00:16:28	00:16:30	I think I know who's behind this.
272	00:16:30	00:16:32	Theresa's assistant Chad.
273	00:16:32	00:16:38	I thought he might have hated her enough to kill her, but I guess he had a smaller-scale revenge plan in mind.
274	00:16:38	00:16:40	Still. Ew.
275	00:16:40	00:16:43	What about the green paste Sara found in the victim's wound?
276	00:16:43	00:16:44	Ah. Chromium oxide.
277	00:16:44	00:16:48	Used to sharpen knives and razors on pieces of leather.
278	00:16:48	00:16:51	The piece of leather is called a strop.
279	00:16:51	00:16:53	And the method of sharpening is called stropping.
280	00:16:53	00:16:58	You'd take a razor with an imperfect edge, and begin stropping.
281	00:17:00	00:17:10	The leather hugs the blade's edge as the grit from the chromium oxide tears away any imperfections and burrs, leaving our slasher of Seville with a sharper-than- sharp blade.
282	00:17:10	00:17:14	Something Theresa Shea knew all too well.
283	00:17:14	00:17:15	I'm sorry to bother you with this.
284	00:17:15	00:17:17	Oh, it's no bother.
285	00:17:17	00:17:19	You said that it might be important to our investigation.
286	00:17:19	00:17:22	And it might be nothing, but I wanted to make sure you saw it.
287	00:17:23	00:17:25	Should be good to go. Thank you.
288	00:17:27	00:17:30	This is tape of the newscast from right before the murder.
289	00:17:30	00:17:34	Ella was giving her remote report 00 p.m. Pacific.
290	00:17:34	00:17:37	And this is our Doppler radar from the same time.
291	00:17:37	00:17:39	Two storm fronts crashing into one another.
292	00:17:39	00:17:41	A training. Mm-hmm.
293	00:17:41	00:17:44	Our satellite shows two dense storms covering the sky comprehensively.
294	00:17:44	00:17:46	No light breaking through anywhere.
295	00:17:46	00:17:49	But if you look behind Ella in the shot...
296	00:17:49	00:17:50	You can see the moon.
297	00:17:50	00:17:56	Which wouldn't be possible if the clouds were as dense as your Doppler suggests at the time of broadcast.
298	00:17:56	00:17:57	Exactly.
299	00:17:57	00:18:00	I think this tape was made before the two fronts trained into one.
300	00:18:00	00:18:02	So you're saying Ella wasn't broadcasting live?
301	00:18:02	00:18:05	But she was having a conversation with Theresa.
302	00:18:05	00:18:06	No, she didn't, remember?
303	00:18:06	00:18:08	Rainy, can you play the tape? Mm-hmm.
304	00:18:08	00:18:13	Uh, Theresa, I'm having trouble hearing you, so let me just report what I know.
305	00:18:13	00:18:16	How long before the murder do you think this was recorded?
306	00:18:16	00:18:17	Ballpark?
307	00:18:17	00:18:19	Maybe a couple of hours.
308	00:18:19	00:18:21	Is there any way to confirm this?
309	00:18:21	00:18:22	I don't know of any.
310	00:18:22	00:18:25	I know who we can talk to.
311	00:18:31	00:18:33	Hi, Denny.
312	00:18:33	00:18:34	Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.
313	00:18:34	00:18:36	I have a technical question.
314	00:18:36	00:18:40	Well, you've come to the right place.
315	00:18:40	00:18:42	Okay.
316	00:18:42	00:18:51	So, is it possible to prerecord a report in one of your remote vans, and then send it to newsroom as if it were live?
317	00:18:51	00:18:52	I suppose so.
318	00:18:52	00:18:55	You'd have to fool the internal clocks on the van side.
319	00:18:55	00:18:57	And what about on this end?
320	00:18:57	00:19:02	Is there any way of telling if a van is not where a reporter might say it is?
321	00:19:02	00:19:03	Yes.
322	00:19:03	00:19:05	Yes, there is.
323	00:19:07	00:19:09	Here, ma'am.
324	00:19:18	00:19:21	This is from last night.
325	00:19:21	00:19:22	What am I looking at? Oh, T.O.C.
326	00:19:22	00:19:24	Transmission Operations Control.
327	00:19:24	00:19:27	It's like an air traffic controller for all our microwave signals.
328	00:19:27	00:19:29	And how many signals do you have?
329	00:19:29	00:19:33	Four remote vans times 11 towers all over Clark county.
330	00:19:33	00:19:35	A lot of signal permutations.
331	00:19:35	00:19:39	Wow, I had no idea how complex this all was.
332	00:19:39	00:19:41	FCC rules are a bitch.
333	00:19:41	00:19:52	The guy in the van finds the strongest signal path and beams the microwaves to the signal tower where it is amplified and rerouted back here to our broadcast center.
334	00:19:52	00:19:55	And when the signal comes back, it lets us know where it's been.
335	00:19:55	00:20:01	So when Theresa was killed, were Ella and her cameraman where they said they were?
336	00:20:01	00:20:03	Actually... no.
337	00:20:03	00:20:10	If the van was here, the tower they transmitted to is at an impossible angle.
338	00:20:10	00:20:11	There's a whole mountain in the way.
339	00:20:11	00:20:13	Why would they lie?
340	00:20:13	00:20:16	It's a good question.
341	00:20:20	00:20:21	Um, where's Robbie?
342	00:20:21	00:20:23	I thought you were talking to him, too.
343	00:20:23	00:20:25	My friend Nick is talking to him in the next room.
344	00:20:25	00:20:28	Just there behind the mirror.
345	00:20:30	00:20:33	Tonight, on KVKC News with Theresa Shea.
346	00:20:35	00:20:36	What's this?
347	00:20:36	00:20:39	That is the opening of your newscast two weeks ago.
348	00:20:39	00:20:43	Welcome to the KVKC Local News at 11 I'm Theresa Shea.
349	00:20:43	00:20:45	And I'm Ella St. James.
350	00:20:45	00:20:51	Our top story tonight, Bobby Reed, son of Dennis Reed, pleads guilty to drug charges and...
351	00:20:53	00:20:55	Congratulations. Co-anchor.
352	00:20:55	00:20:57	Don't congratulate me; it didn't last.
353	00:20:57	00:20:59	No, it didn't, did it?
354	00:20:59	00:21:04	Just last week, you were back out in the field and it was the Theresa show all over again.
355	00:21:04	00:21:05	What changed?
356	00:21:05	00:21:08	Honestly, I don't know.
357	00:21:08	00:21:11	It felt like Paulsen was grooming me to take over.
358	00:21:11	00:21:12	I know Theresa felt the same.
359	00:21:12	00:21:15	I still have the claw marks.
360	00:21:15	00:21:18	So he demoted you back into the field?
361	00:21:18	00:21:19	Mm.
362	00:21:19	00:21:21	I was actually fired once.
363	00:21:21	00:21:23	Really drove me crazy.
364	00:21:23	00:21:27	I think if I was demoted, I don't know what I would have done.
365	00:21:27	00:21:30	Don't worry about what's going on in there.
366	00:21:30	00:21:33	Worry about what's going on in here.
367	00:21:33	00:21:36	This is your T.O.C. report from the news station.
368	00:21:36	00:21:39	Okay.
369	00:21:39	00:21:43	It tells me you weren't where you said you were when you were broadcasting.
370	00:21:43	00:21:45	Do I need a lawyer?
371	00:21:45	00:21:46	It doesn't matter to me.
372	00:21:46	00:21:51	I'll just ask your boss if it's possible to prerecord a live news segment.
373	00:21:51	00:21:54	I think we both know what he's gonna say.
374	00:21:54	00:21:58	Of course I fantasized about killing Theresa.
375	00:21:59	00:22:01	But I wouldn't.
376	00:22:01	00:22:03	It's not who I am. Not why I got into news.
377	00:22:03	00:22:05	So, it was an ethical thing?
378	00:22:05	00:22:06	For starters.
379	00:22:06	00:22:09	And, uh, falsifying a news report?
380	00:22:09	00:22:10	It was a weather stand up.
381	00:22:10	00:22:12	Soaking-wet fluff-- they should've sent Rainy.
382	00:22:12	00:22:14	But they sent you.
383	00:22:14	00:22:15	Why?
384	00:22:15	00:22:18	Not they-- Theresa.
385	00:22:18	00:22:21	She felt threatened, so she alpha-femaled me.
386	00:22:21	00:22:23	It was a big screw you to Ella.
387	00:22:23	00:22:24	Nobody challenged Theresa.
388	00:22:24	00:22:25	Not even Paulsen.
389	00:22:25	00:22:30	So, you faked your news report, fabricated an alibi, snuck into the station...
390	00:22:30	00:22:31	No.
391	00:22:31	00:22:33	I mean, yes.
392	00:22:33	00:22:38	We were sneaking, but... for a very different reason.
393	00:22:38	00:22:43	Robby and I, we worked closely together.
394	00:22:43	00:22:44	We got closer.
395	00:22:44	00:22:47	Physical.
396	00:22:47	00:22:49	Don't get me wrong, I'm married...
397	00:22:49	00:22:50	And she loves her husband.
398	00:22:50	00:22:52	I get that.
399	00:22:52	00:22:54	But when we found the time, we would try to...
400	00:22:54	00:22:56	Step away, every once in a while.
401	00:22:56	00:23:00	So when the rain gig came up, we played hooky.
402	00:23:00	00:23:01	Went to our usual spot.
403	00:23:01	00:23:04	To the King's Bridge Motel...
404	00:23:04	00:23:05	on D Street.
405	00:23:05	00:23:07	That's fairly close to the tower you broadcast from.
406	00:23:07	00:23:12	Well, I'd ask you for a receipt, but, uh...
407	00:23:12	00:23:14	It's not exactly a receipt hotel.
408	00:23:14	00:23:20	So, Ella, if you didn't do it, maybe you could help us with who did.
409	00:23:20	00:23:22	I don't know who.
410	00:23:24	00:23:26	But maybe I know why.
411	00:23:27	00:23:29	Theresa was working on something.
412	00:23:29	00:23:30	A story, a big one, I think.
413	00:23:30	00:23:32	How do you know?
414	00:23:32	00:23:36	I started noticing that she would take her journal and her bag with her, even to the restroom.
415	00:23:36	00:23:38	Maybe she was just paranoid.
416	00:23:38	00:23:40	She was on a story.
417	00:23:40	00:23:45	Despite our differences, Theresa and I were birds of a feather.
418	00:23:45	00:23:49	And back in her day, she was a hell of an investigative reporter.
419	00:23:49	00:23:52	She was kind of my idol.
420	00:23:52	00:23:56	Well, I did look all through her work computer, and I really didn't find anything out of the ordinary.
421	00:23:56	00:23:59	If it were me, I'd keep it all at home.
422	00:24:16	00:24:18	Nice digs.
423	00:24:18	00:24:21	Boy, I'll say.
424	00:24:21	00:24:26	Guess it pays a lot better to report crime than it does to solve it. (laughs)
425	00:24:26	00:24:28	Well, you could say that about any job.
426	00:24:28	00:24:30	Except crime-- I heard it doesn't pay.
427	00:24:32	00:24:33	Warrant served.
428	00:24:33	00:24:35	Okay, so...
429	00:24:35	00:24:37	Theresa's working on some big secret story, right?
430	00:24:37	00:24:39	Where does she keep it?
431	00:24:39	00:24:41	Not in the living room, seems untouched.
432	00:24:41	00:24:44	Theresa Shea lived alone.
433	00:24:44	00:24:45	Right? Divorced, three times.
434	00:24:45	00:24:50	Well, I know when I take work home, sometimes it'll make its way into the bedroom.
435	00:24:50	00:24:52	Yeah, but you're not single, you're married.
436	00:24:52	00:24:55	Yeah, but, um...
437	00:24:55	00:24:59	my place often looks a lot like this.
438	00:25:16	00:25:18	Okay, maybe not exactly like this.
439	00:25:18	00:25:20	Russell?
440	00:25:20	00:25:24	I think I just found what we're looking for.
441	00:25:24	00:25:26	Oh, my.
442	00:25:26	00:25:28	Theresa was certainly into something.
443	00:25:28	00:25:30	Like she was obsessed.
444	00:25:30	00:25:32	Good chance this obsession is what got her killed.
445	00:25:43	00:25:47	Theresa Shea earned her stripes as an investigative reporter.
446	00:25:47	00:25:51	Looks like she's still got it. Or had it.
447	00:25:51	00:25:52	News clippings, Internet articles.
448	00:25:52	00:25:58	I got copies of police reports all marked up and lots of arson reports.
449	00:25:58	00:26:04	All these clippings are about a series of unsolved warehouse and store fires on the east side 17 years ago.
450	00:26:04	00:26:09	Why is a superficial nip-tuck diva digging into cold cases about a firebug?
451	00:26:09	00:26:11	She wasn't digging, she was excavating.
452	00:26:11	00:26:13	Yeah, but why was she so invested?
453	00:26:13	00:26:16	She didn't need the story to advance her career.
454	00:26:16	00:26:17	Right?
455	00:26:17	00:26:19	Yet, she spent all her time here.
456	00:26:21	00:26:22	She ate all her meals in here, too.
457	00:26:22	00:26:23	Hmm.
458	00:26:23	00:26:26	Living alone can drive you a little crazy.
459	00:26:26	00:26:30	Yeah, well, there's crazy and then there's Colonel Kurtz crazy.
460	00:26:30	00:26:32	Mm.
461	00:26:33	00:26:35	Maybe she wasn't always alone.
462	00:26:35	00:26:40	One of these wine glasses is wearing lipstick and the other isn't.
463	00:26:40	00:26:42	Wonder who our mystery date is.
464	00:26:42	00:26:44	I'll get them to Henry.
465	00:26:48	00:26:50	Reporter's notebook.
466	00:26:50	00:26:54	Maybe this can help us make sense out of all this organized chaos.
467	00:26:54	00:26:58	What is that writing, some kind of shorthand maybe?
468	00:26:58	00:26:59	Gregg style, to be specific.
469	00:26:59	00:27:02	Haven't seen that for years.
470	00:27:02	00:27:06	Our victim's very old school.
471	00:27:06	00:27:08	I suppose some of our answers might be here.
472	00:27:14	00:27:15	You must be running on fumes.
473	00:27:15	00:27:17	You should go home.
474	00:27:17	00:27:20	Home is where the coded notebook is.
475	00:27:29	00:27:32	Have you talked to him since the NTSB guy?
476	00:27:32	00:27:35	Nothing happened with NTSB.
477	00:27:35	00:27:37	How come you can't pick up the phone?
478	00:27:37	00:27:42	Because I feel like when I do, I'm gonna be very sad when I hang up.
479	00:27:42	00:27:44	How do you know?
480	00:27:44	00:27:47	'Cause he wants to talk.
481	00:27:48	00:27:50	Want some help?
482	00:27:50	00:27:53	Oh, that's... that's really nice.
483	00:27:53	00:27:55	You should go home, have some fun.
484	00:27:55	00:27:56	This is fun.
485	00:27:56	00:27:58	I'm really good at crosswords.
486	00:27:58	00:28:01	Yeah, okay.
487	00:28:01	00:28:05	Uh, so Gregg style shorthand is written phonetically.
488	00:28:05	00:28:08	Cat is k-a-t, knee is n-e.
489	00:28:08	00:28:13	Soft consonants like ch and sh are written horizontally.
490	00:28:13	00:28:16	And hard consonants like t and d are written downward.
491	00:28:16	00:28:19	Like this.
492	00:28:19	00:28:22	And vowel sounds are curves and circles.
493	00:28:22	00:28:25	Okay, let's crack the code.
494	00:28:25	00:28:27	All right.
495	00:28:59	00:29:05	17 years ago, a series of warehouse arsons in the furniture district baffled investigators.
496	00:29:05	00:29:08	Cases were unsolved and put on ice.
497	00:29:08	00:29:17	But Theresa dug up lab reports, which pointed to dynamite and wax paper, and that looks an awful lot like a 17-year-old version of what blew that power transformer.
498	00:29:17	00:29:20	Do we have a clue as to who would've made either device?
499	00:29:20	00:29:21	No, but Theresa did.
500	00:29:21	00:29:24	She referenced in her journal someone named G.H.
501	00:29:24	00:29:27	He was a demolitions expert, uh, storied career in the military.
502	00:29:27	00:29:29	He's now working as... A motivational speaker.
503	00:29:29	00:29:31	Didn't you just investigate a fire?
504	00:29:31	00:29:33	Yes, I did-- Garrett Howard.
505	00:29:33	00:29:36	He was a retired military munitions expert.
506	00:29:36	00:29:37	So, where's he now?
507	00:29:37	00:29:39	He's downstairs.
508	00:29:44	00:29:46	Anything of note with Mr. Howard?
509	00:29:46	00:29:50	Well, most people die in fires from smoke inhalation, not burns.
510	00:29:50	00:29:53	But take a look at this lung.
511	00:29:53	00:29:55	Very clean.
512	00:29:55	00:29:56	He didn't die from the fire.
513	00:29:56	00:29:58	Nope.
514	00:29:58	00:30:01	Did you, by chance, find anything on the back of his neck?
515	00:30:01	00:30:03	Your instincts are good as always.
516	00:30:03	00:30:05	Come on around here.
517	00:30:10	00:30:12	There, we got it.
518	00:30:12	00:30:17	Knife wound right between the occipital bone of the skull and atlas, C1.
519	00:30:17	00:30:19	Consistent with the murder of Theresa Shea.
520	00:30:19	00:30:23	Yeah, right down to the green paste. Mm-hmm.
521	00:30:23	00:30:28	In related news, there has been a rash of vandalism across Las Vegas landmarks.
522	00:30:28	00:30:32	With the latest hijinks taking place at the Palermo fountain...
523	00:30:32	00:30:33	Yesterday's news?
524	00:30:33	00:30:37	And the day before and the day before that.
525	00:30:37	00:30:42	Trying to make sense out of this whole dysfunctional family of a news team.
526	00:30:42	00:30:44	Theresa sucked up a lot of oxygen.
527	00:30:44	00:30:47	I just want to see if any of her siblings look a little short of breath.
528	00:30:47	00:30:49	Any luck? No.
529	00:30:49	00:30:51	You? A little bit.
530	00:30:51	00:30:53	Theresa was investigating a cold case.
531	00:30:53	00:30:55	It was serial arson.
532	00:30:55	00:31:01	Those famous fires in the furniture district were started by an explosive device that lead us to a current case.
533	00:31:01	00:31:02	Which one's that?
534	00:31:02	00:31:04	Finlay's dead motivational speaker.
535	00:31:04	00:31:06	Turns out, he was a demolitions expert.
536	00:31:06	00:31:12	And he specialized in the type of devices that were all found at those old arson sites-- dynamite with a remote trigger.
537	00:31:12	00:31:13	Rings a bell.
538	00:31:13	00:31:15	And...
539	00:31:15	00:31:20	best that I can tell, the device was a precursor to the explosive device that you found at the transformer.
540	00:31:20	00:31:27	Okay, so the guy 17 years ago builds incendiary devices to start fires, then nothing.
541	00:31:27	00:31:29	Then he blows up a transformer.
542	00:31:29	00:31:30	Why'd he start up again now?
543	00:31:30	00:31:33	The similarities don't end there.
544	00:31:35	00:31:40	Guy's wound track has the same green paste as we found in Theresa's pithing.
545	00:31:40	00:31:45	So we're looking at a locked-room mystery, tucked into an enigma, wrapped in dynamite paper.
546	00:31:45	00:31:47	You can say that again. (laughs)
547	00:31:51	00:31:52	Hey, Sara.
548	00:31:52	00:31:54	Let me ask you something.
549	00:31:54	00:31:56	How you doing? You all right?
550	00:31:56	00:31:57	I'm fine.
551	00:31:57	00:32:02	Well, you just seemed a little bit down when we were at Theresa's place.
552	00:32:02	00:32:08	Um, I don't know, uh, woman married to her career without much to show for it.
553	00:32:08	00:32:11	It's a little depressing.
554	00:32:12	00:32:15	Yeah, uh...
555	00:32:15	00:32:16	I don't mean to pry, but...
556	00:32:16	00:32:17	Pause right there. I know, I know.
557	00:32:17	00:32:19	I'm supposed to be your boss.
558	00:32:19	00:32:20	Separation of church and state.
559	00:32:20	00:32:24	No, no, no, hit, uh, pause with the remote, and-and back it up a little bit.
560	00:32:24	00:32:25	Oh.
561	00:32:29	00:32:30	There, you see it?
562	00:32:30	00:32:33	Map's not only behind her, it's on her dress.
563	00:32:33	00:32:35	I see London, I see France.
564	00:32:35	00:32:39	There's only one reason that we'd be able to see that on her dress.
565	00:32:39	00:32:43	She's got a green stain on her.
566	00:32:45	00:32:47	Worse than that.
567	00:32:47	00:32:49	It's incriminating. What are you talking about?
568	00:32:49	00:32:53	We found a green paste on the body of Theresa and also on a second victim.
569	00:32:53	00:32:55	It's a compound used for sharpening knives.
570	00:32:55	00:32:56	It was used by our killer.
571	00:32:56	00:33:02	Wait a minute, you don't think... I mean, why would Rainy have a knife-sharpening paste on her dress?
572	00:33:02	00:33:04	Why don't we let Rainy answer that question.
573	00:33:04	00:33:08	Well, let's see. Um, clear skies, red dress, Wednesday.
574	00:33:08	00:33:15	The Doppler network was funky, so I spent most of my time looking over Denny's shoulder in his cage while he was trying to fix the connection.
575	00:33:15	00:33:17	(phone ringing) Excuse me.
576	00:33:17	00:33:19	Greg, what's going on?
577	00:33:19	00:33:21	Hey, you're not gonna believe this.
578	00:33:21	00:33:28	I was just sorting through the storied career of Garrett Howard Denny Jones.
579	00:33:28	00:33:31	In what context?
580	00:33:31	00:33:33	He was in the military, too, briefly.
581	00:33:33	00:33:36	He got in trouble for stealing supplies.
582	00:33:36	00:33:38	In and out of the stockade. Short fuse.
583	00:33:38	00:33:40	Was deemed unfit for duty.
584	00:33:40	00:33:42	Received a less-than-honorable discharge.
585	00:33:42	00:33:44	So, Denny and Garrett Howard...
586	00:33:44	00:33:46	Were brothers in arms.
587	00:33:46	00:33:48	Where's Morgan?
588	00:33:57	00:33:59	Denny?
589	00:34:01	00:34:02	Wait.
590	00:34:04	00:34:05	Denny!
591	00:34:14	00:34:15	We've just seen a man emerge.
592	00:34:15	00:34:18	We don't know if he works for the station.
593	00:34:18	00:34:20	Denny.
594	00:34:20	00:34:21	Denny, hey.
595	00:34:24	00:34:25	I didn't do anything wrong!
596	00:34:25	00:34:28	Okay, okay, nobody said you did.
597	00:34:28	00:34:29	Is that the murder weapon?
598	00:34:29	00:34:32	This is my knife, yes, but it didn't...
599	00:34:32	00:34:34	I didn't kill Theresa!
600	00:34:34	00:34:35	Hey, drop that knife! Stay away!
601	00:34:35	00:34:37	Everybody move back, move back, move back.
602	00:34:37	00:34:38	Move your camera. Move!
603	00:34:38	00:34:40	I didn't kill Theresa, because she loved me.
604	00:34:40	00:34:42	And I loved her, too! I loved her!
605	00:34:42	00:34:44	I... Get away!
606	00:34:44	00:34:45	Hey, get the cameras out of here! I'm serious!
607	00:34:45	00:34:48	I believe you. Let us talk about this.
608	00:34:48	00:34:49	No! I will not go back to jail!
609	00:34:49	00:34:50	I cannot go back to jail!
610	00:34:50	00:34:52	All we want to do is take you in.
611	00:34:52	00:34:54	Just gonna go have a conversation. Stop!
612	00:34:54	00:34:56	You drop that knife right now!
613	00:34:56	00:34:58	No, this is just, this is all just too much.
614	00:34:58	00:34:59	Denny, listen to me, calm down.
615	00:34:59	00:35:01	You don't want to do this.
616	00:35:01	00:35:02	Now come on. Denny...
617	00:35:05	00:35:06	Denny. Denny.
618	00:35:10	00:35:12	No!
619	00:35:13	00:35:16	Wait! Why'd you do that?!
620	00:35:16	00:35:18	Denny, okay... Can you see this?
621	00:35:20	00:35:23	Move back, will ya, please?
622	00:35:23	00:35:24	Look at me. I'm here.
623	00:35:24	00:35:26	I got you.
624	00:35:26	00:35:28	Move!
625	00:35:35	00:35:38	Denny. Denny.
626	00:35:47	00:35:49	Unlike lightning, tragedy tragedy strikes twice at KVKC.
627	00:35:49	00:36:01	I'm at the site of yet a second violent death in as many days, as the news station is rocked to its foundation by the suicide of a man suspected in the murder of Theresa Shea.
628	00:36:01	00:36:10	Embroiled in a mystery that keeps on unraveling, authorities have kept quiet thus far, but the man who killed himself has been identified as Denny Jones.
629	00:36:10	00:36:12	So what motivated these events?
630	00:36:12	00:36:14	Psychotic break? Crime of passion?
631	00:36:14	00:36:18	Until the facts come in, one can only speculate.
632	00:36:19	00:36:22	Stupid.
633	00:36:23	00:36:24	Okay, okay, okay.
634	00:36:26	00:36:28	Boss? Yeah?
635	00:36:28	00:36:31	I have an update on the wine glass we found at Theresa Shea's.
636	00:36:31	00:36:33	Thought you didn't find a match.
637	00:36:33	00:36:35	No, we didn't until the knife came in.
638	00:36:35	00:36:37	But sweat around the handle matched the DNA on the glass.
639	00:36:37	00:36:41	Denny was sharing wine with Theresa.
640	00:36:41	00:36:42	And sharing a bed.
641	00:36:42	00:36:46	I found evidence of sexual activity in her sheets.
642	00:36:46	00:36:47	Strange bedfellows.
643	00:36:47	00:36:49	Everybody needs somebody.
644	00:36:49	00:36:51	But if he was in love, why kill her?
645	00:36:51	00:36:54	I don't know.
646	00:36:54	00:36:56	Love makes you do all sorts of stupid things.
647	00:36:56	00:36:59	You don't think he did it, do you?
648	00:37:00	00:37:01	Sorry.
649	00:37:03	00:37:04	Okay, this is gonna be fun.
650	00:37:04	00:37:08	Now, when we came into this, we had three suspects and no evidence, right?
651	00:37:08	00:37:12	Now we got some evidence, I want to play a little game.
652	00:37:12	00:37:14	Capture the flag.
653	00:37:15	00:37:16	Bear with me.
654	00:37:16	00:37:20	Okay, this particular flag is gonna represent Theresa Shea's life.
655	00:37:20	00:37:22	We're gonna stick it right here.
656	00:37:22	00:37:24	Sara, you're gonna be playing Theresa.
657	00:37:24	00:37:28	Three of you are each gonna be playing one of our suspects.
658	00:37:28	00:37:31	Now you'll start from wherever our evidence placed them.
659	00:37:31	00:37:32	We'll turn off the lights.
660	00:37:32	00:37:40	Whoever can get in, take Theresa's life and get out in 20 seconds is our killer.
661	00:37:42	00:37:44	20 seconds to airtime. Are you good?
662	00:37:44	00:37:47	I'm gonna be playing Mr. Paulsen.
663	00:37:47	00:37:49	Sara, you're my anchor, right?
664	00:37:49	00:37:50	Alive and well.
665	00:37:50	00:37:52	Okay, Greg, where are you at?
666	00:37:52	00:37:57	All right, I am at the coffee machine, about to go to the garage and make a deposit.
667	00:37:57	00:37:58	I'm at my Doppler station.
668	00:37:58	00:38:00	I'm monitoring the storm as instructed.
669	00:38:00	00:38:03	Computer puts Rainy here until the lights go out.
670	00:38:03	00:38:04	Thank you, Rainy.
671	00:38:04	00:38:05	Denny?
672	00:38:05	00:38:07	I'm in my cage.
673	00:38:07	00:38:10	Internet activity locks me here until we lose power.
674	00:38:10	00:38:14	As soon as the lights go out, I want everyone to try to kill Sara.
675	00:38:14	00:38:18	Ready, set, go.
676	00:38:19	00:38:37	19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Lights up.
677	00:38:46	00:38:48	Well, Chad was too far away.
678	00:38:48	00:38:49	And Denny was, too.
679	00:38:49	00:38:51	Rainy couldn't get to Theresa.
680	00:38:51	00:38:53	None of us made it in time.
681	00:38:53	00:38:55	Yeah, but...
682	00:38:55	00:38:57	the flag is gone.
683	00:38:58	00:39:00	Well, who took it then?
684	00:39:06	00:39:11	You were all too far away, because you were sent too far away by me.
685	00:39:11	00:39:13	Detective, did you see me leave this room?
686	00:39:13	00:39:14	No, I did not.
687	00:39:14	00:39:18	And as far as everyone in here knew, Paulsen never left either.
688	00:39:18	00:39:20	Theresa, pull it back. Go three.
689	00:39:20	00:39:22	Thanks, Ella.
690	00:39:22	00:39:25	(phone beeps, dials) We'll try to get that sound sorted out.
691	00:39:25	00:39:33	Blew up the power, stepped outside, took care of Theresa, got back in the room before the generator kicked on.
692	00:39:33	00:39:35	Theresa, are you okay?
693	00:39:37	00:39:43	Do these... articles look familiar to you?
694	00:39:43	00:39:45	Yeah, let me give you a hint-- the A.P.
695	00:39:45	00:39:46	credits the photographs to a younger you.
696	00:39:46	00:39:48	Yeah.
697	00:39:48	00:39:51	I took pictures of the furniture district fires.
698	00:39:51	00:39:53	You know, they never caught that guy.
699	00:39:53	00:39:54	Never say never.
700	00:39:54	00:39:56	What's that supposed to mean?
701	00:39:56	00:39:59	You know what? Let's talk about your old pal, Garrett Howard.
702	00:39:59	00:40:01	The one who liked to play with dynamite.
703	00:40:01	00:40:02	I don't know a Garrett Howard.
704	00:40:02	00:40:04	Really?
705	00:40:04	00:40:08	And yet, you did a whole profile on him on one of your news shows.
706	00:40:08	00:40:09	What was it called? Uh...
707	00:40:09	00:40:13	Army demolition expert turns motivational speaker.
708	00:40:13	00:40:16	That's a hell of a favor to do for somebody you don't know.
709	00:40:16	00:40:17	And not the only favor.
710	00:40:17	00:40:20	You also hired his hapless army buddy, Denny Jones.
711	00:40:20	00:40:24	So he gave you the job as a favor to a friend?
712	00:40:24	00:40:26	How does that work?
713	00:40:26	00:40:28	Um, Garrett said Paulsen owes him his life.
714	00:40:28	00:40:30	Any idea why?
715	00:40:30	00:40:32	Denny and Theresa together. Wow.
716	00:40:32	00:40:34	I didn't see that coming.
717	00:40:34	00:40:35	Did you see that coming? No.
718	00:40:35	00:40:37	No, that must have come as a surprise to you, too.
719	00:40:37	00:40:39	And now...
720	00:40:39	00:40:40	Theresa knew that you had a secret.
721	00:40:40	00:40:47	She figured if she could uncover it, then she could keep her job. You wanted to have her replaced with a younger anchorwoman.
722	00:40:47	00:40:49	So she became a one-woman news team.
723	00:40:49	00:40:52	And she connected you to these fires 17 years ago.
724	00:40:52	00:40:56	First one on the scene because you lit the match.
725	00:40:56	00:40:58	That must've given Theresa a lot of leverage.
726	00:40:58	00:40:59	Leverage?
727	00:40:59	00:41:01	She was a washed-up talent.
728	00:41:01	00:41:03	Her best years were behind her.
729	00:41:03	00:41:05	Why'd you keep her on the anchor desk then?
730	00:41:05	00:41:07	See, to me, that sounds like a...
731	00:41:07	00:41:08	deal with the devil.
732	00:41:08	00:41:10	Yeah, one you couldn't live with.
733	00:41:10	00:41:12	So you made a plan to kill Theresa.
734	00:41:12	00:41:16	Asked Garrett Howard for another explosive device-- just one more job.
735	00:41:16	00:41:21	But then, like Theresa, he knew your secret.
736	00:41:21	00:41:23	So you had to dispose of him, too.
737	00:41:28	00:41:31	And that left poor Denny.
738	00:41:31	00:41:34	So you borrowed his knife, and you set him up.
739	00:41:34	00:41:37	I'm a reporter.
740	00:41:37	00:41:38	I'm not a murderer.
741	00:41:38	00:41:40	I wouldn't even know how to wield a knife.
742	00:41:40	00:41:42	Hate to fact-check you on that, pal, but...
743	00:41:42	00:41:43	You know, actually, I'm loving this.
744	00:41:43	00:41:52	We found an old news story that you ran years ago about a killer who stabbed his victim right in the sweet spot, right under the skull.
745	00:41:52	00:41:55	When you take notes, you really take notes.
746	00:41:55	00:42:05	You know, in my business, before making outrageous accusations, on or off the air, you need a little thing called evidence.
747	00:42:05	00:42:07	In our business, too.
748	00:42:11	00:42:15	This is a partial print from the transformer explosions.
749	00:42:15	00:42:17	It's also your left index finger.
750	00:42:19	00:42:21	Oops.
751	00:42:23	00:42:27	Welcome to the KVKC 00. I'm Jennifer Thomas.
752	00:42:27	00:42:36	Breaking news tonight-- which sadly hits close to home-- long-time news producer Fred Paulsen has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Theresa Shea.
753	00:42:53	00:42:54	Hello.
754	00:42:54	00:42:57	You've been hard to get a hold of.
755	00:42:57	00:43:01	Yeah. Um, I'm so sorry.
756	00:43:01	00:43:03	How are you?
757	00:43:03	00:43:06	I'm okay. Is now a good time?
