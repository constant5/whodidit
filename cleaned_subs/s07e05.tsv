0	00:00:15	00:00:17	Urine.
1	00:00:18	00:00:19	I don't smell it.
2	00:00:19	00:00:22	Ever since Father started leaving the church open at night.
3	00:00:22	00:00:24	The church has gotten a lot more use.
4	00:00:24	00:00:26	Yeah, as an orgy house and a toilet.
5	00:00:26	00:00:29	No. People come in at all hours of the night to pray.
6	00:00:29	00:00:35	Dear Jesus, please keep me from blowing all my laundry money on the nickel slots at the Gas 'N' Go.
7	00:00:40	00:00:43	Oh, somebody's done their business right here next to Jesus.
8	00:00:43	00:00:45	Oh, no, not again.
9	00:00:58	00:01:02	Right here on the eve of the apocalypse, a miracle.
10	00:01:22	00:01:24	Somebody went to a lot of trouble to get her up there.
11	00:01:24	00:01:26	Why? I wonder.
12	00:01:26	00:01:30	Somebody had a grudge against the church or somebody in the church.
13	00:01:30	00:01:34	Or maybe they were just mad at God.
14	00:01:37	00:01:39	Well, Jesus died for our sins.
15	00:01:39	00:01:42	What sin did she die for?
16	00:02:26	00:02:32	You know, if you think about it, this is one of the oldest ways to kill somebody.
17	00:02:32	00:02:35	Considering where we are, highly symbolic.
18	00:02:35	00:02:37	All right, what do you got?
19	00:02:37	00:02:38	How we gonna do this?
20	00:02:38	00:02:42	Well, the two-by-four is tied to the scaffold with a single loop.
21	00:02:42	00:02:45	There is an empty pulley up here.
22	00:02:46	00:02:47	We could lower her down with that.
23	00:02:47	00:02:50	That's probably how the killer got her up there in the first place.
24	00:02:50	00:02:52	Then he ditched the rope.
25	00:02:52	00:02:55	I wouldn't be surprised to find it around here someplace.
26	00:02:55	00:02:56	First things first.
27	00:02:56	00:03:02	We'll use our rope; I'll run it through this pulley, and then let you take the weight.
28	00:03:02	00:03:08	I'll mark the rope, cut the knot; down she goes.
29	00:03:16	00:03:17	Ready?
30	00:03:17	00:03:18	Yeah.
31	00:03:19	00:03:20	You take the weight. I'll cut it on three.
32	00:03:20	00:03:24	One, two, three.
33	00:03:24	00:03:26	Got it?
34	00:03:26	00:03:27	Yeah, ready.
35	00:03:28	00:03:30	Oh.
36	00:03:30	00:03:33	Whoever tied her up there had to be strong enough to deadlift her weight.
37	00:03:33	00:03:34	Yeah, either that or highly motivated.
38	00:03:34	00:03:38	You know how it is once somebody's adrenaline gets pumping.
39	00:03:38	00:03:40	Feel like they can do anything.
40	00:03:47	00:03:50	All right, that's it.
41	00:04:06	00:04:08	Look, shouldn't Father Frank be here by now?
42	00:04:08	00:04:10	Father Frank lives in manana land.
43	00:04:10	00:04:12	Well, I'm sure he's on his way.
44	00:04:12	00:04:14	Father Frank is a wonderful priest.
45	00:04:14	00:04:17	And since he's been here, church attendance has tripled.
46	00:04:17	00:04:19	Among our female congregants.
47	00:04:19	00:04:23	(sighs) And we have sponsors for our building fund.
48	00:04:23	00:04:24	One sponsor.
49	00:04:24	00:04:25	The Big Hombre?
50	00:04:26	00:04:28	The car dealership.
51	00:04:28	00:04:34	Time of death was sometime 00 and 4 Nasty head wound.
52	00:04:34	00:04:40	She was actively bleeding, so she had to have been alive when she was tied to the cross.
53	00:04:40	00:04:42	Good chance she died of suffocation.
54	00:04:42	00:04:44	Like Jesus.
55	00:04:44	00:04:46	Well, Jesus had a footrest.
56	00:04:46	00:04:49	He was able to lift himself up and take short breaths.
57	00:04:49	00:04:51	But this young lady was hanging.
58	00:04:51	00:04:57	Her pectoral muscles probably became paralyzed and the intercostal muscles were unable to function.
59	00:04:57	00:05:00	She was able to breathe out, but not breathe in.
60	00:05:00	00:05:04	In time, carbon dioxide built up in her lungs and bloodstream.
61	00:05:04	00:05:06	Edema built up in the chest cavity.
62	00:05:06	00:05:07	Heart went into fibrillation.
63	00:05:09	00:05:12	Gruesome torture in any century.
64	00:05:13	00:05:14	In 18 years, this is my first crucifixion.
65	00:05:14	00:05:19	In a Catholic church with no crucifixes.
66	00:05:19	00:05:24	I imagine the priest is a resurrection theologian, as opposed to a crucifixion theologian.
67	00:05:25	00:05:27	They believe in forgiveness rather than penance.
68	00:05:27	00:05:29	We could all use a little forgiveness.
69	00:05:29	00:05:33	She was bleeding from her head wounds, and the beating didn't take place up there.
70	00:05:34	00:05:36	Well, the blood pool is gravitational.
71	00:05:38	00:05:39	And the blood trail...
72	00:05:42	00:05:45	...the tips are pointing towards the statue.
73	00:05:45	00:05:48	She was bleeding on the way in.
74	00:05:48	00:05:52	I'll backtrack, see if I can find the point of origin.
75	00:05:52	00:05:54	Excuse me, huh?
76	00:05:56	00:05:58	I-I got to go, Father. I'll see you.
77	00:05:58	00:05:59	Okay.
78	00:05:59	00:06:01	I'm the pastor of the church.
79	00:06:01	00:06:02	Hey, Captain.
80	00:06:02	00:06:03	He'll take care of you.
81	00:06:03	00:06:05	Thank you.
82	00:06:05	00:06:07	Father Frank Berlin.
83	00:06:07	00:06:09	I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
84	00:06:09	00:06:11	You were supposed to be here 45 minutes ago. Where you been?
85	00:06:11	00:06:13	Been serving breakfast at the shelter.
86	00:06:13	00:06:14	I understand there's been a death in the church.
87	00:06:14	00:06:16	How soon before you're out of here?
88	00:06:16	00:06:18	Father, this is a murder investigation.
89	00:06:19	00:06:20	00.
90	00:06:20	00:06:21	Yeah, I understand.
91	00:06:21	00:06:24	Sorry, Father, but, uh, this is a crime scene.
92	00:06:24	00:06:26	You're not gonna get your church back for a while.
93	00:06:26	00:06:28	Is it all right if we set Mass in the community center?
94	00:06:28	00:06:30	Yeah, sure, I have no problem with that.
95	00:06:30	00:06:33	Sister, would you tell the choir we'll be singing In Paradisum.
96	00:06:33	00:06:35	I'll take care of it, Father.
97	00:06:35	00:06:38	We sing the hymn for the dead every time we have a death.
98	00:06:38	00:06:42	Sisters couldn't identify the victim, so we'll need you to take a look.
99	00:06:42	00:06:43	Sorry. I didn't mean to sound cavalier.
100	00:06:43	00:06:46	It's just we've had over half a dozen deaths this year.
101	00:06:46	00:06:48	We've never had to close the church.
102	00:06:48	00:06:54	That's because, in this neighborhood, those derelicts and drug addicts died of heatstroke, overdose and old age.
103	00:06:54	00:06:56	None of them were strung up in the rafters.
104	00:06:56	00:07:00	Father Frank Berlin, this is Gil Grissom from the crime lab.
105	00:07:05	00:07:06	Do you recognize her?
106	00:07:12	00:07:14	I'll take that as a no.
107	00:07:15	00:07:17	Excuse me, Father.
108	00:07:17	00:07:18	Is that blood on your jacket?
109	00:07:20	00:07:22	We had a fight in the shelter.
110	00:07:22	00:07:23	I had to break it up.
111	00:07:23	00:07:25	We're gonna need to take your clothes.
112	00:07:25	00:07:27	No, you can't have my clothes.
113	00:07:27	00:07:30	Then you have to come downtown to the police station.
114	00:07:30	00:07:35	If you're gonna say Mass later, you have to change anyway, right?
115	00:07:35	00:07:37	Greg, go with him, collect his clothing.
116	00:07:41	00:07:44	Is it a bigger sin to lie if you're a priest?
117	00:07:44	00:07:46	I hope so.
118	00:08:21	00:08:24	This one's for you, Sam.
119	00:08:35	00:08:37	When will I get those back?
120	00:08:37	00:08:39	I only have three sets of clothes.
121	00:08:39	00:08:43	Respectfully, Father, a woman's been murdered in your church and your clothes have blood on them.
122	00:08:43	00:08:45	You're lucky you're not under arrest.
123	00:10:14	00:10:17	Was there bougainvillea at the crime scene?
124	00:10:19	00:10:21	Two shrubs at the entrance of the church.
125	00:10:23	00:10:26	A row of four on the wall of the community center.
126	00:10:26	00:10:31	Three bushes behind the rectory adjacent to the statue of St. Jude.
127	00:10:31	00:10:36	Did you anticipate that question in order to impress me with your powers of observation?
128	00:10:36	00:10:37	Memory's a gift.
129	00:10:37	00:10:38	Mmm.
130	00:10:39	00:10:41	From whom?
131	00:10:41	00:10:44	Who do you think?
132	00:10:44	00:10:50	Well, I wouldn't necessarily call myself an atheist, but I am not sold on the notion of a higher power.
133	00:10:50	00:10:55	However, I used to love the stories of the saint.
134	00:10:56	00:10:58	This job certainly challenges your faith.
135	00:10:58	00:11:00	Yes, it does.
136	00:11:00	00:11:01	But I have science.
137	00:11:02	00:11:05	I believe we need a little of both.
138	00:11:07	00:11:14	Sometimes I think we made up God just to have someone to blame for our mistakes.
139	00:11:19	00:11:22	It's just a theory.
140	00:13:28	00:13:30	Hey.
141	00:13:30	00:13:32	Hey!
142	00:13:32	00:13:34	Hey, I found it.
143	00:13:34	00:13:38	Rope, nails, hammers, everything.
144	00:13:45	00:13:47	Oh, yeah.
145	00:14:05	00:14:07	Something I said?
146	00:14:07	00:14:09	No, dear.
147	00:14:10	00:14:12	I didn't offend you, did I?
148	00:14:12	00:14:15	Did I say something offensive to you as a Catholic?
149	00:14:15	00:14:18	I'm not really a Catholic anymore, you know.
150	00:14:18	00:14:32	I suppose I practice a kind of secular Catholicism that involves ritualizing certain aspects of everyday life and imbuing them with a spiritual intensity they might not otherwise possess, but I don't want to put too fine a point on it.
151	00:14:35	00:14:38	And the rosary beads are a part of that.
152	00:14:38	00:14:40	This belonged to my mother.
153	00:14:43	00:14:45	Take a look at this pattern.
154	00:15:01	00:15:07	Five series of ten beads each representing the Five Mysteries separated by five Our Father beads.
155	00:15:07	00:15:10	Who would strangle someone with a rosary?
156	00:15:11	00:15:14	Probably the same person who would crucify someone in a church.
157	00:15:33	00:15:35	St. Jude.
158	00:15:35	00:15:37	Patron saint of lost causes.
159	00:15:37	00:15:41	And that's why it's so difficult to keep the local kids from defacing this statue.
160	00:15:41	00:15:44	Did you run those tests on my clothes?
161	00:15:44	00:15:47	We did. The blood on your clothes is not a match to the blood on the victim.
162	00:15:47	00:15:49	So do I get my clothes back?
163	00:15:49	00:15:50	Not just yet.
164	00:15:51	00:15:53	I have a favor to ask.
165	00:15:53	00:15:56	You steal my clothes and then you want to ask for another favor?
166	00:15:56	00:15:59	We'd like permission to search your rectory and the nun's apartments.
167	00:15:59	00:16:03	Just because someone dies in our church doesn't mean we have anything to do with it.
168	00:16:03	00:16:06	Well, we want to eliminate you as suspects.
169	00:16:06	00:16:10	That's what you said when you fingerprinted us, and the truth is you don't have enough for a warrant.
170	00:16:10	00:16:12	You're right.
171	00:16:12	00:16:13	But you have nothing to hide.
172	00:16:15	00:16:21	You really think if I killed a woman, I'd leave her body in my own church? It's so obvious that it obviates suspicion.
173	00:16:22	00:16:24	Mmm, I'm not that smart.
174	00:16:24	00:16:25	Well, that's hardly the argument to make.
175	00:16:25	00:16:27	What is it you're looking for?
176	00:16:27	00:16:28	Rosaries.
177	00:16:28	00:16:32	Mr. Grissom, I didn't realize you were here.
178	00:16:32	00:16:33	That's all right, Sister.
179	00:16:33	00:16:35	We don't have to hide anything from Mr. Grissom.
180	00:16:35	00:16:38	Uh, he's here to confiscate our rosaries.
181	00:16:38	00:16:39	I don't know where mine are. Do you?
182	00:16:39	00:16:42	It's probably in the sacristy.
183	00:16:42	00:16:43	We'll need all the rosaries.
184	00:16:43	00:16:46	Uh, even Sister Elizabeth's?
185	00:16:46	00:16:49	She's not going to like that.
186	00:16:49	00:16:54	Happy day for Sister Elizabeth, for she delights in what she dislikes.
187	00:17:19	00:17:23	the rope, the 2x4s, and one of these hammers.
188	00:17:23	00:17:25	I just haven't found it yet.
189	00:17:25	00:17:27	But all this was in the same utility closet.
190	00:17:27	00:17:29	He didn't bring anything with him? Hmm-mm.
191	00:17:29	00:17:31	What does this feel like to you?
192	00:17:31	00:17:33	Inside job.
193	00:17:33	00:17:38	I mean maybe one of the construction workers wasn't a fan of the victim.
194	00:17:38	00:17:39	I'm going to call Brass.
195	00:17:46	00:17:47	What?
196	00:17:47	00:17:48	I've solved your case.
197	00:17:48	00:17:49	Bull. No, cow.
198	00:17:52	00:17:53	not human.
199	00:17:53	00:17:54	Bovine.
200	00:17:56	00:17:57	They have red cows?
201	00:17:57	00:18:00	You betcha, partner. Guernseys.
202	00:18:00	00:18:02	Maybe the scaffold was used somewhere else.
203	00:18:02	00:18:03	Like on a farm.
204	00:18:03	00:18:05	Or maybe it was secondary transfer.
205	00:18:05	00:18:07	Well, you can take care of that.
206	00:18:07	00:18:08	I've done all the heavy lifting.
207	00:18:09	00:18:10	As usual.
208	00:18:15	00:18:17	Oh, hi. Hi.
209	00:18:17	00:18:19	I saw you at the crime scene.
210	00:18:19	00:18:21	I thought you were on desk duty until the coroner's inquest.
211	00:18:21	00:18:27	Yeah, I was starting to get a serious case of trucker butt so I told Grissom that I wanted to, uh, get back out with the team.
212	00:18:27	00:18:30	Yeah, there's no therapy like work.
213	00:18:31	00:18:33	You doing okay?
214	00:18:33	00:18:35	Yeah.
215	00:18:35	00:18:37	Well, hang in there.
216	00:18:37	00:18:39	All right.
217	00:18:48	00:18:50	Mr. Bombay.
218	00:18:50	00:18:52	We found your keys at the scene of our murder.
219	00:18:52	00:18:55	We also found your car close by.
220	00:18:57	00:18:59	I don't know anything about a murder.
221	00:18:59	00:19:03	Well, we also found a wad of bloody tissues in the front seat of your vehicle.
222	00:19:03	00:19:04	What... what's going on?
223	00:19:04	00:19:06	You tell me.
224	00:19:06	00:19:09	I loaned my car to a woman I work with last night.
225	00:19:09	00:19:10	She sings at my club.
226	00:19:10	00:19:12	Charlotte Danville. Is she all right?
227	00:19:12	00:19:15	Was this your friend?
228	00:19:20	00:19:21	Yeah, that's her.
229	00:19:23	00:19:24	Who did... who did this to her?
230	00:19:25	00:19:26	Why did she borrow your car?
231	00:19:26	00:19:29	She had to... She had to do another set and needed to change her clothes.
232	00:19:29	00:19:31	Doesn't she have her own car?
233	00:19:31	00:19:32	She had a Lexus.
234	00:19:32	00:19:34	Totally tricked out.
235	00:19:34	00:19:35	So why did she borrow yours?
236	00:19:35	00:19:36	I don't know.
237	00:19:36	00:19:37	I didn't get the whole story.
238	00:19:37	00:19:39	She seemed upset.
239	00:19:39	00:19:41	She was talking to this guy.
240	00:19:41	00:19:46	I had to send a waitress over to remind her that she was getting paid to sing.
241	00:19:46	00:19:48	You ever see the guy move forward?
242	00:19:48	00:19:50	Yeah, it's that guy that sells cars on television.
243	00:19:50	00:19:53	Uh... Cody White.
244	00:19:53	00:19:54	The Big Hombre.
245	00:19:54	00:19:57	I mean, but a lot of guys came in to see Charlotte.
246	00:19:57	00:19:59	I mean, it's not like she slept around or anything.
247	00:19:59	00:20:01	I tried.
248	00:20:01	00:20:02	Can I go now?
249	00:20:02	00:20:05	Not without an alibi.
250	00:20:05	00:20:06	Where did you spend the night?
251	00:20:06	00:20:08	I allowed myself to succumb to the pleasures of Donna.
252	00:20:09	00:20:13	And she kept me up to the wee hours of the morning gratifying her abnormal lust.
253	00:20:18	00:20:20	She sleeps with her eyes open.
254	00:20:26	00:20:28	Yeah, this is it.
255	00:20:28	00:20:30	Well, this car's already been cleaned and detailed.
256	00:20:31	00:20:32	It's ready to be sold.
257	00:20:32	00:20:34	Well, I guess it's a change of plans. No.
258	00:20:34	00:20:36	No, there's not a change of planes.
259	00:20:36	00:20:38	This baby's staying right where she sits.
260	00:20:38	00:20:39	I'm not in the give-away-the-car-to-cops business.
261	00:20:39	00:20:41	I'm in the sell-the-car- to-willing-victims business.
262	00:20:41	00:20:47	Mr. White, we have a court order to examine this car for evidence related to the murder of Charlotte Danville.
263	00:20:47	00:20:48	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlotte?
264	00:20:48	00:20:50	She and I are friends.
265	00:20:50	00:20:51	I... I knew her.
266	00:20:52	00:20:55	Yeah, I know. We have a witness who places you arguing with her last night.
267	00:20:55	00:20:57	You may be one of the last people to see her alive.
268	00:20:57	00:20:59	Yeah.
269	00:20:59	00:21:00	I was with her.
270	00:21:00	00:21:02	I went to see Charlotte to give her the car.
271	00:21:03	00:21:06	Helped Charlotte through a rough patch, but lately she been ducking me.
272	00:21:06	00:21:07	What am I supposed to do now?
273	00:21:07	00:21:09	Walk home?
274	00:21:09	00:21:11	I'll give you money for a cab.
275	00:21:11	00:21:13	Tomorrow, we'll see about getting you a good used car.
276	00:21:13	00:21:15	Some junker.
277	00:21:15	00:21:16	Thanks a lot.
278	00:21:16	00:21:18	Some friend you are.
279	00:21:18	00:21:19	Take your damn car.
280	00:21:21	00:21:25	Guess that's what you get for helping a friend, you know.
281	00:21:25	00:21:29	Look, I feel awful about about Charlotte. I really do.
282	00:21:30	00:21:32	whatever happened happened after I got this car.
283	00:21:32	00:21:34	Well, I feel awful too, but the car is coming with me.
284	00:21:35	00:21:38	No sign of forced entry.
285	00:21:40	00:21:46	Does this look like the condo of a woman who sings weekends at the Gorilla Room?
286	00:21:46	00:21:49	Looks like the fight started here.
287	00:21:49	00:21:53	Got some blood, some here on the pillow.
288	00:21:53	00:21:55	But no blood trail.
289	00:21:55	00:21:58	The real beating took place in the bushes at the church.
290	00:21:58	00:22:00	This was just the opening act.
291	00:22:00	00:22:03	Explains the bloody tissue found in the backseat of Hugo's car.
292	00:22:03	00:22:11	I guess she got a bloody nose or a fat lip here, ran out and used Hugo's car to go to the church.
293	00:22:11	00:22:16	The killer must have followed her and caught up with her there.
294	00:22:19	00:22:21	She had quite the career.
295	00:22:27	00:22:28	Sofia.
296	00:22:30	00:22:31	You recognize that guy?
297	00:22:31	00:22:34	Father Frank.
298	00:22:34	00:22:37	I mean, a lot younger, obviously.
299	00:22:37	00:22:40	You know him?
300	00:22:40	00:22:41	No.
301	00:22:41	00:22:43	That's the Big Hombre.
302	00:22:43	00:22:45	He sells cars on TV.
303	00:22:45	00:22:47	She's known these guys forever.
304	00:22:57	00:22:58	Here's a rosary.
305	00:23:00	00:23:02	Looks like it's broken.
306	00:23:06	00:23:09	Hmm. Could be the one she was strangled with.
307	00:23:11	00:23:16	And here's her purse and cell phone.
308	00:23:16	00:23:18	You don't leave home without those unless you're in a hurry.
309	00:23:18	00:23:21	Or you're being chased.
310	00:23:21	00:23:24	TV's on pause.
311	00:23:27	00:23:30	Well, there they are again.
312	00:23:30	00:23:33	Someone was taking a trip down memory lane.
313	00:23:39	00:23:41	There was a man in her life.
314	00:23:49	00:23:51	Mr. Frisky.
315	00:23:51	00:23:58	Drain smells like whiskey, empty bottles in the trash, more liquor than you could use in a wild weekend.
316	00:23:58	00:24:01	She might have been going on the wagon.
317	00:24:04	00:24:07	Folic acid.
318	00:24:07	00:24:10	Fresh fruit, vegetables, plenty of milk.
319	00:24:14	00:24:17	You think she was pregnant?
320	00:24:17	00:24:19	We'll have Robbins run a pregnancy test.
321	00:25:07	00:25:09	Hey.
322	00:25:09	00:25:10	Got another rosary for your collection.
323	00:25:11	00:25:14	Where'd you get this?
324	00:25:14	00:25:15	Catherine found it in Charlotte's condo.
325	00:25:15	00:25:18	There is some evidence that the fight started there.
326	00:25:18	00:25:24	Charlotte's bag and cell phone were there, as if she left in a hurry.
327	00:25:24	00:25:27	Are those Father Frank's?
328	00:25:28	00:25:29	Yeah.
329	00:25:33	00:25:34	Where's Father Frank?
330	00:25:34	00:25:37	Father Frank is hearing confessions tonight.
331	00:25:37	00:25:40	It's St. Bart's all over again.
332	00:25:40	00:25:42	Only that time, he went in handcuffs.
333	00:25:42	00:25:43	That never happened.
334	00:25:43	00:25:45	It was just a rumor.
335	00:25:51	00:25:52	Hey!
336	00:25:54	00:25:58	Didn't your mother tell you you're not supposed to fight in church?
337	00:25:58	00:25:59	Cody White.
338	00:25:59	00:26:00	What's up, hombre?
339	00:26:00	00:26:03	Father Frank and I are actually old friends.
340	00:26:05	00:26:07	Just having a conversation about church finances.
341	00:26:07	00:26:09	But aren't you the one who's funding the renovation of the church?
342	00:26:09	00:26:10	Not anymore.
343	00:26:10	00:26:14	Well, there you go.
344	00:26:14	00:26:15	We done here?
345	00:26:15	00:26:17	Yeah.
346	00:26:19	00:26:23	So what sins did he commit to earn the punch-out penance?
347	00:26:23	00:26:25	Let's talk about it downtown.
348	00:26:39	00:26:42	These are unique rosaries, Father.
349	00:26:42	00:26:44	Handmade in Italy.
350	00:26:44	00:26:47	And they're sequentially numbered on the back.
351	00:26:49	00:26:51	So we know that they were purchased together.
352	00:26:51	00:26:54	One of them is yours; one we found at the victim's condo.
353	00:26:54	00:26:56	Did you give it to her?
354	00:26:56	00:26:58	Yes.
355	00:26:58	00:27:03	You know, Father, when we asked you if you knew her, you said you didn't.
356	00:27:03	00:27:09	After I saw Charlotte's body, I don't recall being asked any questions.
357	00:27:09	00:27:13	Um, uh, maybe I said no to what I was seeing.
358	00:27:13	00:27:15	I don't really remember much about yesterday.
359	00:27:15	00:27:17	What about the night before?
360	00:27:17	00:27:19	I was at the shelter.
361	00:27:19	00:27:23	You know, we can't find anyone who remembers seeing you there after midnight.
362	00:27:23	00:27:26	Because I wasn't there past midnight.
363	00:27:26	00:27:26	Where were you?
364	00:27:27	00:27:30	One of our regulars, Marty, came in high on crack.
365	00:27:30	00:27:33	He got into an argument, a fight with one of the other men, and I...
366	00:27:33	00:27:34	What time was that?
367	00:27:34	00:27:36	Uh, it was late.
368	00:27:36	00:27:39	I don't wear a watch. We had to call the paramedics; you can check with them.
369	00:27:39	00:27:41	00 a.m.
370	00:27:41	00:27:42	Where were you then?
371	00:27:42	00:27:46	I was out with Marty trying to walk off his high to keep him out of trouble.
372	00:27:46	00:27:48	Does Crackhead Marty have a last name?
373	00:27:49	00:27:50	I-I don't know.
374	00:27:50	00:27:57	You know, Father, listen, I'm telling you, these answers-- none of them work for me.
375	00:27:57	00:27:59	Well, then put me in jail.
376	00:27:59	00:28:03	I'll still be doing exactly the same work I'm doing out here with exactly the same results.
377	00:28:03	00:28:04	I don't want to do that.
378	00:28:07	00:28:08	Sister Bridget?
379	00:28:09	00:28:12	I think you should see this, Cap.
380	00:28:12	00:28:15	I'm sorry I didn't come forward sooner, Father.
381	00:28:15	00:28:17	We caught her trying to bring this into the building.
382	00:28:17	00:28:18	This is the hammer I used to build the cross.
383	00:28:18	00:28:19	No, no, she didn't.
384	00:28:19	00:28:23	She must've got that out of my office at the shelter.
385	00:28:23	00:28:24	I took it off Marty.
386	00:28:24	00:28:26	Father, sit down, please.
387	00:28:26	00:28:29	Sister, excuse me, but...
388	00:28:29	00:28:33	could you tell us how you managed to haul the victim's body to the top of the scaffolding?
389	00:28:33	00:28:37	I used the rope and the pulley, the one the workmen use.
390	00:28:37	00:28:38	But why did you kill her?
391	00:28:38	00:28:41	Because she had to be stopped.
392	00:28:41	00:28:45	She was coming for Father, and I couldn't let that happen.
393	00:28:45	00:28:47	Now...
394	00:28:47	00:28:49	do your job.
395	00:28:49	00:28:51	Arrest me.
396	00:28:51	00:28:54	Sister, how much do you weigh?
397	00:28:54	00:28:56	123 pounds.
398	00:28:56	00:28:59	It's a question of physics.
399	00:28:59	00:29:03	Charlotte weighed 140 pounds, plus the weight of the cross.
400	00:29:03	00:29:08	You don't weigh enough or have enough strength to have hoisted the body 17 feet into the air.
401	00:29:08	00:29:11	It was a miracle.
402	00:29:13	00:29:17	The only miracle is I'm not charging you with obstruction.
403	00:30:06	00:30:10	Father Frank.
404	00:30:10	00:30:17	The blood on the hammer is a match to the blood found on the Father's clothes, but none of it is from Charlotte.
405	00:30:17	00:30:22	Well, you know, he told me that he broke up a fight at the shelter.
406	00:30:22	00:30:27	I think Sister Bridget found the bloody hammer and confessed to the murder because she thought Father Frank was guilty.
407	00:30:28	00:30:30	If she thinks he did it, maybe he did it.
408	00:30:30	00:30:34	But why does she think that he did it?
409	00:30:37	00:30:44	You know, his move from St. Bart's to St. Jude's involved a female parishioner who committed suicide.
410	00:30:44	00:30:49	No charges were filed, but the parish board asked that he be removed.
411	00:30:49	00:30:51	I can do you one better.
412	00:30:51	00:30:55	Catherine found two sets of semen stains on Charlotte's bedding.
413	00:30:55	00:30:57	Unknown contributor on the bed skirt.
414	00:30:57	00:30:59	Probably doesn't get washed as often.
415	00:30:59	00:31:03	But the one on the sheet is a match to Father Frank.
416	00:31:03	00:31:04	It's probably more recent.
417	00:31:07	00:31:11	Uh, Doc Robbins says that Charlotte was about ten weeks pregnant.
418	00:31:11	00:31:14	Maybe he's the unwilling father of her unborn child.
419	00:31:14	00:31:18	Well, DNA will give us a profile.
420	00:31:18	00:31:21	One more thing that he did not tell us.
421	00:31:21	00:31:23	We didn't ask.
422	00:31:23	00:31:29	I don't know, I mean, most people give their friends, uh, subscriptions to Fruit of the Month club.
423	00:31:30	00:31:32	But you gave your friend Charlotte a condo and a car.
424	00:31:32	00:31:35	It's like I told you before, I was helping her out.
425	00:31:35	00:31:38	I was letting her live there and use the car till she got on her feet.
426	00:31:38	00:31:42	She came back to Vegas broke and strung out, and I was helping her.
427	00:31:42	00:31:44	So it was supposed to be a short-term thing?
428	00:31:44	00:31:46	It was supposed to be short-term, but it was endless.
429	00:31:46	00:31:47	Sort of like renovating St. Jude's.
430	00:31:47	00:31:49	So is that what the fight in the church was about?
431	00:31:49	00:31:51	No, that's not what the fight was about.
432	00:31:51	00:31:53	I went to talk to him about Charlotte.
433	00:31:54	00:31:57	I thought maybe taking the car back had something to do with her death.
434	00:31:57	00:31:59	I don't know. Then he said something; I said...
435	00:31:59	00:32:01	I don't even remember, to tell you the truth.
436	00:32:01	00:32:02	he lost it.
437	00:32:03	00:32:04	I've never seen Frank like that.
438	00:32:04	00:32:06	So do you always have personal conversations in the confessional?
439	00:32:07	00:32:10	Can't talk to him in his office with that Sister Bridget hovering around.
440	00:32:10	00:32:14	Besides, I'd never want his relationship with Charlotte to be open to misinterpretation.
441	00:32:14	00:32:16	Now, why would their relationship be open to misinterpretation?
442	00:32:16	00:32:19	They were more than friends.
443	00:32:21	00:32:29	Going by her scrapbook, this seems to have been a golden time in Charlotte's life-- high school.
444	00:32:29	00:32:37	There's a lot of pictures of the three of them together, but the only two-shots are of Frank and Charlotte except for this one.
445	00:32:38	00:32:41	Evidently, she went to her prom with Cody.
446	00:32:41	00:32:43	She looks thrilled. (sarcastic)
447	00:32:43	00:32:48	The next picture of Frank, he's in a seminary.
448	00:32:48	00:32:55	Maybe, uh, giving up Charlotte was the sacrifice he made to join the Church.
449	00:33:07	00:33:10	I need to ask you a few more questions.
450	00:33:10	00:33:14	Go ahead and ask the question you really want to know.
451	00:33:14	00:33:16	Who killed Charlotte Danville?
452	00:33:19	00:33:22	I did.
453	00:33:35	00:33:38	Single malt express is leaving the station as soon as I get home.
454	00:33:39	00:33:44	Look, I know it sounds nuts, but this is not the way a resurrection theologian would kill his pregnant mistress.
455	00:33:44	00:33:45	He confessed.
456	00:33:45	00:33:47	He's a Catholic. They're full of guilt.
457	00:33:47	00:33:48	He's a priest, for God's sakes.
458	00:33:49	00:33:50	That's the whole point of the priesthood.
459	00:33:50	00:33:52	No sleeping around.
460	00:33:52	00:33:55	More energy for good works and noble deeds.
461	00:33:55	00:33:59	Now you find me some evidence to exonerate the good Father, and we'll talk.
462	00:34:09	00:34:12	Hi. I heard Grissom wants us to keep digging.
463	00:34:12	00:34:14	This Charlotte's car?
464	00:34:14	00:34:15	Yeah.
465	00:34:15	00:34:19	I found blood smears, but they've been washed.
466	00:34:19	00:34:24	Cody said he repo'd the car at the club and drove it back to the lot.
467	00:34:24	00:34:27	There shouldn't be any blood in this car.
468	00:34:27	00:34:32	Well, unless Father Frank drove it that night, and we've got no reason to believe that he did.
469	00:34:32	00:34:33	Which brings us back to Cody.
470	00:34:33	00:34:35	Do you have a big enough sample for DNA?
471	00:34:35	00:34:37	No.
472	00:34:37	00:34:42	But I do know one spot the detailers never hit.
473	00:34:48	00:34:50	Bloody shoe impression on the brake pedal.
474	00:34:50	00:34:51	Well, I'll compare it to Father Frank's shoes.
475	00:34:52	00:34:54	If it's not a match, I'll get a warrant for Cody's shoes.
476	00:34:54	00:34:56	I'll get a sample of the blood to DNA.
477	00:34:58	00:35:02	I'm trying to shoot a commercial here, so I don't see why this can't wait.
478	00:35:02	00:35:06	I can't even read this, so why don't you tell me what it is that you want?
479	00:35:06	00:35:08	Your boots and a DNA sample.
480	00:35:08	00:35:09	Well, there's my wife.
481	00:35:09	00:35:11	Candy!
482	00:35:11	00:35:13	Get my damn lawyer on the phone now. What's wrong?
483	00:35:13	00:35:16	Would... would you just do it, please?
484	00:35:16	00:35:19	We found rust-colored fur on the scaffold at the crime scene.
485	00:35:19	00:35:24	Well, I'll call a judge and get him to amend the warrant to include the vest.
486	00:35:24	00:35:26	J-J-J-J-J-J... Hold on for a minute, all right?
487	00:35:26	00:35:28	Would you just hang on?
488	00:35:28	00:35:30	Hey, I found these in his office.
489	00:35:30	00:35:32	Positive for blood on the right sole.
490	00:35:32	00:35:34	Where's my wife?
491	00:35:34	00:35:35	Candy?!
492	00:35:35	00:35:39	Well, Big Hombre, it looks like you're going to the hoosegow.
493	00:35:42	00:35:47	So, you don't like crucifixes, but maybe you made an exception when you found out Charlotte was pregnant, hmm?
494	00:35:48	00:35:51	Father...
495	00:35:51	00:35:53	I want you to take a look at this.
496	00:36:01	00:36:03	I'm responsible for her murder.
497	00:36:04	00:36:06	I could never do that.
498	00:36:06	00:36:09	In my world, Father, you're either guilty or innocent.
499	00:36:09	00:36:12	Well, in my world, you can be both.
500	00:36:12	00:36:14	The blood on your boot is Charlotte's.
501	00:36:14	00:36:18	Your footprint was found on the brake pedal of her car in blood.
502	00:36:18	00:36:26	The lab also matched hair from your fur vest to hair found dried in the blood of the victim in the church.
503	00:36:29	00:36:33	Now matter how much evidence you have, I'm the Big Hombre.
504	00:36:33	00:36:37	I get whatever I want, including store-bought justice.
505	00:36:37	00:36:42	And yet, the one thing you couldn't get was Charlotte's love.
506	00:36:42	00:36:47	Yeah, like I said, I only saw her that last time to get the car.
507	00:37:05	00:37:07	Thanks for coming.
508	00:37:07	00:37:10	Come on. I'd come every night if you wanted me to.
509	00:37:10	00:37:12	You know that.
510	00:37:12	00:37:14	Here's the car back.
511	00:37:14	00:37:17	You really are a good friend.
512	00:37:17	00:37:20	No, you gave her the car.
513	00:37:20	00:37:23	You gave her everything.
514	00:37:23	00:37:26	And how did she pay you back?
515	00:37:26	00:37:28	She dumped you for your best friend.
516	00:37:28	00:37:32	(keys jangling) Here's the car back.
517	00:37:32	00:37:33	And I'm moving.
518	00:37:33	00:37:35	Why would you do that?
519	00:37:35	00:37:36	I can't do this anymore.
520	00:37:36	00:37:38	It's not right.
521	00:37:38	00:37:40	I'm in love with another man.
522	00:37:40	00:37:42	I'm sorry, Cody.
523	00:37:42	00:37:44	That's what you got for me?
524	00:37:44	00:37:45	You got, you're sorry?
525	00:37:46	00:37:47	I'm sorry, too.
526	00:37:48	00:37:54	We, uh, found a letter you wrote to the Bishop and pulled it off your computer.
527	00:37:54	00:37:58	The spirit has left my vocation.
528	00:37:58	00:38:04	I've crossed a line in my discipline and committed an act that has left me unfit for the priesthood.
529	00:38:06	00:38:08	What act is that?
530	00:38:08	00:38:12	Putting my love for Charlotte above my love for God.
531	00:38:12	00:38:14	So, you were leaving the priesthood?
532	00:38:14	00:38:20	I was leaving because I loved her, and I wanted to be with her in all ways.
533	00:38:20	00:38:22	Her dying doesn't change that.
534	00:38:22	00:38:23	I still love her.
535	00:38:23	00:38:25	I talked to the Monsignor.
536	00:38:25	00:38:27	It's a complicated process, but I told him I'm leaving.
537	00:38:28	00:38:29	Are you sure?
538	00:38:29	00:38:31	I prayed about it.
539	00:38:31	00:38:33	What came to me was that God is love.
540	00:38:33	00:38:36	Wherever there is true love, God is, as well.
541	00:38:36	00:38:39	I have to follow my heart.
542	00:38:39	00:38:48	And we only made love once, but in the wake of that, I found the husband in me, the father in me.
543	00:38:48	00:38:51	I wanted to be those men for her.
544	00:38:51	00:38:54	And I always loved her.
545	00:38:56	00:38:57	And what if the baby wasn't yours?
546	00:38:57	00:38:59	A child is always welcome.
547	00:38:59	00:39:02	Yeah, I decorated her condo, you know that?
548	00:39:02	00:39:05	I bought her that car.
549	00:39:05	00:39:08	Special-ordered the paint to match the color of her eyes.
550	00:39:08	00:39:11	She didn't care as long as she had a place to stay.
551	00:39:11	00:39:12	That's all she cared about.
552	00:39:12	00:39:15	She cared about Father Frank, didn't she?
553	00:39:15	00:39:18	Did you suspect that she was leaving you for him?
554	00:39:18	00:39:21	Should have, but I didn't.
555	00:39:24	00:39:25	What are you doing here?
556	00:39:26	00:39:28	Look, I'm sorry about the dress, all right?
557	00:39:28	00:39:30	I have to get back to the club.
558	00:39:30	00:39:31	Wait, wait, wait.
559	00:39:31	00:39:34	I want to know who you're leaving me for.
560	00:39:34	00:39:35	No. (slaps)
561	00:39:37	00:39:38	What is that?
562	00:39:41	00:39:42	It's Frank, isn't it?
563	00:39:42	00:39:43	Isn't it?
564	00:39:43	00:39:47	(groaning) It's always been Frank.
565	00:39:50	00:39:52	You know, he doesn't think you did it.
566	00:39:52	00:39:56	But I think that you know who killed Charlotte.
567	00:39:56	00:40:00	He came to the church that day to confess, didn't he?
568	00:40:00	00:40:05	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
569	00:40:05	00:40:07	My last confession was two weeks ago.
570	00:40:07	00:40:09	I lied to my wife seven times.
571	00:40:09	00:40:13	I cheated an old lady out of a classic car.
572	00:40:13	00:40:16	And I killed my best friend for cheating on me with you.
573	00:40:17	00:40:19	You know I can't discuss that.
574	00:40:21	00:40:30	You know, in Vegas, it's routine to hear the most heinous sins, and as a priest, you listen, and in Christ's name, you forgive.
575	00:40:31	00:40:33	I knew she'd go running to him.
576	00:40:33	00:40:37	She'd always run back to Frank, and I knew he wouldn't be there.
577	00:40:37	00:40:39	He was never there.
578	00:40:44	00:40:49	Is that when you thought of crucifying her in Frank's church?
579	00:40:54	00:40:56	I don't know how I came up with that.
580	00:40:59	00:41:03	You know, Frank always used to talk about the problem of human evil.
581	00:41:03	00:41:05	How...
582	00:41:06	00:41:10	you better watch out 'cause it'd come into you in times of despair.
583	00:41:15	00:41:18	Something terrible came into me that night.
584	00:41:48	00:41:52	I loved Charlotte more than anything.
585	00:41:52	00:41:56	The paternity test came back.
586	00:41:56	00:41:58	You were the father.
587	00:42:00	00:42:02	You killed your own baby.
588	00:42:34	00:42:36	You were my friend.
589	00:42:38	00:42:40	You should have come to me like a man.
590	00:42:48	00:42:51	Can you forgive him?
591	00:42:51	00:42:53	That's Christ's mandate.
592	00:42:53	00:42:55	You know what that means.
593	00:42:55	00:42:57	You have no choice.
