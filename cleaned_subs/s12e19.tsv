0	00:00:38	00:00:39	What?
1	00:00:39	00:00:41	Go on.
2	00:00:41	00:00:43	Hmm.
3	00:00:53	00:00:55	Oh!
4	00:00:55	00:00:56	Hey!
5	00:00:56	00:00:57	Hey!
6	00:00:57	00:00:59	Somebody! Hey!
7	00:00:59	00:01:01	Come on! Somebody!
8	00:01:01	00:01:03	No, I can't comment. No.
9	00:01:07	00:01:09	Casino's on lockdown.
10	00:01:09	00:01:11	Nothing goes out; nothing comes in.
11	00:01:11	00:01:14	So, the security here is all ex-cops.
12	00:01:14	00:01:20	30 seconds after the shooting, all the exits were sealed. You call this locked down? No, I know. Split hairs-- locked in.
13	00:01:20	00:01:26	A fire couldn't stop these people from gambling away their money. The shooter's still in the casino, am I right?
14	00:01:26	00:01:29	Somewhere on this floor. And Archie's already tapped into casino surveillance.
15	00:01:29	00:01:32	He pulled a still photo from the footage.
16	00:01:32	00:01:34	Brown hair, orange shirt.
17	00:01:34	00:01:37	Hey, guys, okay, I got facial recognition up and running.
18	00:01:37	00:01:39	Scanning the casino floor now.
19	00:01:39	00:01:42	Helps to know who you're looking for, yes?
20	00:01:43	00:01:44	Guys, got a hit.
21	00:01:44	00:01:46	97% match.
22	00:01:46	00:01:50	Looks like he's heading east towards the video arcade.
23	00:01:50	00:01:52	Okay, all units, we're heading towards the arcade.
24	00:01:52	00:01:54	Let's go. You can run, but you can't hide.
25	00:01:54	00:01:56	Out the way. Move, move, move.
26	00:01:56	00:01:58	Out of the way. Clear out of there, clear out of there.
27	00:02:08	00:02:09	Hey!
28	00:02:14	00:02:16	Oh!
29	00:02:16	00:02:19	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
30	00:02:19	00:02:22	Archie, are you sure that computer's working?
31	00:02:22	00:02:24	'Cause all I'm seeing is a woman in an orange shirt.
32	00:02:24	00:02:27	I don't get it. I swear, I just had him.
33	00:02:28	00:02:30	Hang on a second. I got a hit.
34	00:02:33	00:02:34	He's over by the nightclub.
35	00:02:34	00:02:36	How the hell did he get over there?
36	00:02:36	00:02:38	This is Sara. I'm in the club now.
37	00:02:38	00:02:40	I don't see anybody.
38	00:02:40	00:02:42	Sara, sit tight, wait for backup.
39	00:02:42	00:02:46	Copy that.
40	00:03:07	00:03:09	You see him? No.
41	00:03:15	00:03:16	I lost him again.
42	00:03:16	00:03:19	Come on, Archie, tell me something I don't know.
43	00:03:19	00:03:21	(beeping) Oh. Hang on a second. Oh, I got him.
44	00:03:21	00:03:23	Heading to the elevators. Are you sure about that?
45	00:03:23	00:03:24	Ninety-seven percent.
46	00:03:24	00:03:26	Come on. Yeah.
47	00:03:26	00:03:28	Clear out, clear out.
48	00:03:28	00:03:30	Did you see our suspect? Nothing.
49	00:03:30	00:03:31	Archie.
50	00:03:31	00:03:32	No, I lost visual.
51	00:03:32	00:03:34	He just disappeared. Disappeared!
52	00:03:34	00:03:36	How does a guy disappear in a locked-down casino?
53	00:03:36	00:03:39	What's behind there?
54	00:03:48	00:03:50	An unlocked lockdown. Beautiful.
55	00:03:50	00:03:53	Archie, you got eyes on the stairs? That would be a negative.
56	00:03:53	00:03:55	Great. He's in the tower with a gun.
57	00:03:55	00:03:57	We'll have to go room-to-room. No problem.
58	00:03:57	00:04:00	I got 65 cops and 40 security guards.
59	00:04:00	00:04:01	Yeah, and cameras everywhere.
60	00:04:01	00:04:03	So how the hell did he get away?
61	00:04:39	00:04:46	I know that this is the last place in America where you're still allowed to light up, but do you think it's a good idea with the oxygen...
62	00:04:46	00:04:48	You got a thing against smokers? Smoke.
63	00:04:48	00:04:50	You don't know what you're missing.
64	00:04:50	00:04:52	Okay, Gladys, tell me what happened.
65	00:04:52	00:04:55	First, I heard two shots.
66	00:04:55	00:04:58	Saw that poor man fall after the second shot.
67	00:04:58	00:05:00	Must've been a fight. Why do you say that?
68	00:05:00	00:05:02	I saw the gunman.
69	00:05:02	00:05:03	His nose was bleeding.
70	00:05:08	00:05:09	What happened after that?
71	00:05:09	00:05:13	The guy tosses the man's wallet and tears off into the crowd.
72	00:05:13	00:05:16	Pretty ballsy, trying to rob someone on a casino floor.
73	00:05:16	00:05:18	You're just asking to get caught. (laughs)
74	00:05:18	00:05:20	I mean...
75	00:05:20	00:05:22	you have caught him, right? We're working on it.
76	00:05:22	00:05:29	The detectives will have more questions, so please don't go anywhere. Don't worry about me, hon.
77	00:05:29	00:05:32	$4,436.
78	00:05:32	00:05:34	I ain't budgin' till I get my payout.
79	00:05:34	00:05:36	I wouldn't either.
80	00:05:36	00:05:37	Thank you.
81	00:05:43	00:05:46	Cash, credit cards are missing.
82	00:05:46	00:05:49	But they left a license; that was nice.
83	00:05:49	00:05:52	Dennis Kiel, 58 from Los Angeles.
84	00:05:52	00:05:54	Medical I.D.
85	00:05:54	00:05:56	He was a doctor.
86	00:05:56	00:06:02	And he has a family. I'll have Sara check with the hotel, see if they're registered.
87	00:06:02	00:06:06	Roll him? Yep.
88	00:06:06	00:06:08	Single GSW to the chest.
89	00:06:08	00:06:11	There was no exit wound, so the bullet's still inside him.
90	00:06:11	00:06:15	Black Lung Betty over there said that she heard two shots.
91	00:06:15	00:06:20	So there's another bullet still out there. Yeah. She also said the assailant had a bloody nose.
92	00:06:20	00:06:23	Maybe the victim got a lick in.
93	00:06:23	00:06:27	Ah, that would explain the blood right over there.
94	00:06:28	00:06:31	Yep, gravitational drops.
95	00:06:33	00:06:37	All right, it's too far away from our victim to be his. Yeah.
96	00:06:37	00:06:39	Okay, so...
97	00:06:39	00:06:43	our shooter pulls a gun on our victim.
98	00:06:43	00:06:45	Give me your money.
99	00:06:48	00:06:49	You punch me in the nose.
100	00:06:51	00:06:54	Head jerks back, my gun goes up...
101	00:06:54	00:06:57	Look at that.
102	00:06:57	00:07:02	One shot in the doctor, one shot in the slot machine.
103	00:07:02	00:07:04	Think I should wrap it up and take it back to the lab?
104	00:07:04	00:07:06	Took the words right out of my mouth, smart-ass.
105	00:07:06	00:07:08	I'll go clear it with the casino.
106	00:07:08	00:07:11	Unbelievable.
107	00:07:13	00:07:15	So, how many more rooms to go?
108	00:07:15	00:07:17	Oh, only 1,200.
109	00:07:21	00:07:24	LVPD?
110	00:07:24	00:07:26	Oh, that's hilarious.
111	00:07:26	00:07:28	It's about time you show... Oh!
112	00:07:28	00:07:30	Whoa.
113	00:07:30	00:07:33	How you doing? Fine.
114	00:07:33	00:07:35	(Brody clears throat loudly) Uh, y...
115	00:07:35	00:07:37	We're, uh, we're looking for a man.
116	00:07:37	00:07:40	Uh, me, too. This man.
117	00:07:40	00:07:42	That's him-- I've been waiting for him for hours.
118	00:07:42	00:07:46	Yeah? Well, you might be waiting a little bit longer than that.
119	00:07:46	00:07:48	He just shot a guy in the casino.
120	00:07:48	00:07:50	What?
121	00:07:50	00:07:52	I met him in the casino bar last night.
122	00:07:52	00:07:54	He was cute; perfect gentleman.
123	00:07:54	00:07:56	Until later.
124	00:07:56	00:07:59	Which is what you want, right?
125	00:08:01	00:08:03	Did he use protection?
126	00:08:03	00:08:05	Yeah. Why?
127	00:08:05	00:08:07	Means we got DNA.
128	00:08:07	00:08:08	And...
129	00:08:08	00:08:11	he left behind a wrapper.
130	00:08:11	00:08:13	Maybe a print.
131	00:08:13	00:08:15	Did this perfect gentleman have a name?
132	00:08:15	00:08:17	Kind of. Called himself X-Man.
133	00:08:17	00:08:22	(laughs) Pretty cool. Kind of 9âˆš Weeks, foreign identity.
134	00:08:22	00:08:24	Why are you taking my sheets?
135	00:08:24	00:08:25	Why do you think?
136	00:08:25	00:08:27	Oh.
137	00:08:27	00:08:29	I hope you don't think I'm a slut.
138	00:08:29	00:08:31	I mean, I am not a slut. No, no, of course not.
139	00:08:31	00:08:34	Did X-Man leave anything else behind we should know about?
140	00:08:34	00:08:36	Well, I...
141	00:08:36	00:08:39	I kind of made a video.
142	00:08:39	00:08:43	We're gonna... kind of need to watch that.
143	00:08:45	00:08:48	Mrs. Kiel, Las Vegas Police.
144	00:08:50	00:08:53	Well...
145	00:08:53	00:08:57	So, the front desk called up here to Kiel's room and nobody answered.
146	00:08:59	00:09:01	Somebody's here.
147	00:09:06	00:09:08	It's okay. What's your name, son?
148	00:09:08	00:09:10	Avery.
149	00:09:10	00:09:12	Avery Kiel. Is your mother here?
150	00:09:12	00:09:14	My mom...
151	00:09:14	00:09:16	she died last year.
152	00:09:17	00:09:19	Where's my dad?
153	00:09:22	00:09:24	What happened?
154	00:09:25	00:09:29	Somebody robbed your dad, Avery.
155	00:09:29	00:09:30	Where?
156	00:09:30	00:09:31	In the casino.
157	00:09:33	00:09:35	This is my fault.
158	00:09:35	00:09:38	I begged Dad to come out this weekend to see Kanye.
159	00:09:38	00:09:40	Last night...
160	00:09:40	00:09:43	after he won all that money, I told him to be careful.
161	00:09:43	00:09:44	What money, Avery?
162	00:09:44	00:09:46	At the slot machines.
163	00:09:46	00:09:49	He won, like, 800 bucks.
164	00:09:49	00:09:51	All these people were watching.
165	00:09:51	00:09:57	So, after your dad won all the money, did these people follow him anywhere?
166	00:09:57	00:09:58	No.
167	00:09:58	00:10:01	I mean... I-I don't know.
168	00:10:03	00:10:07	He bought those sneakers for me.
169	00:10:07	00:10:10	He was always buying me things.
170	00:10:10	00:10:12	Is that your dad's computer?
171	00:10:12	00:10:14	Yeah.
172	00:10:14	00:10:16	We're gonna need to take it with us, okay?
173	00:10:16	00:10:22	Avery, do you have any relatives who live nearby, you know, an aunt or an uncle, anybody?
174	00:10:22	00:10:24	I have cousins in Wisconsin.
175	00:10:24	00:10:27	I haven't seen them in, like, forever.
176	00:10:29	00:10:31	What's gonna happen to me?
177	00:10:31	00:10:33	You'll be okay.
178	00:10:33	00:10:35	We're gonna keep you safe.
179	00:10:35	00:10:38	This officer here is gonna stay with you, okay?
180	00:10:43	00:10:49	I'm gonna come back and check in on you in a little while, all right?
181	00:10:49	00:10:51	I promise.
182	00:10:54	00:10:57	Hey, Doc, what you got?
183	00:10:57	00:10:59	A bit of a puzzle.
184	00:10:59	00:11:02	Our victim sustained a single GSW to the center torso.
185	00:11:02	00:11:07	Bullet entered the abdomen, penetrated the liver.
186	00:11:07	00:11:10	Does that look like a penetrating wound to you?
187	00:11:10	00:11:13	Looks like chopped liver to me.
188	00:11:13	00:11:18	I found these lead fragments and this copper jacket.
189	00:11:18	00:11:19	Looks like a .38 hollow-point.
190	00:11:19	00:11:25	In most cases, when you find only the jacket, it means the core had separated.
191	00:11:25	00:11:27	I didn't find any core.
192	00:11:27	00:11:28	All I found was this.
193	00:11:32	00:11:34	That is weird.
194	00:11:34	00:11:35	Hourglass shape.
195	00:11:35	00:11:37	Never seen that before.
196	00:11:37	00:11:38	Interesting.
197	00:12:19	00:12:20	Slots R Us.
198	00:12:20	00:12:21	You shoot it, we trash it.
199	00:12:21	00:12:23	How can I help you?
200	00:12:23	00:12:24	How's it going? Having fun?
201	00:12:24	00:12:26	You know how I like to break things.
202	00:12:26	00:12:30	So far, I've only found the jacket of a hollow-point.
203	00:12:30	00:12:31	No core, right?
204	00:12:31	00:12:33	I hate it when you do that.
205	00:12:33	00:12:37	Did you find a little red thing, hourglass shape?
206	00:12:37	00:12:39	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
207	00:12:39	00:12:41	I found that.
208	00:12:41	00:12:42	I'm looking at it right now.
209	00:12:42	00:12:43	Well, go ahead and bindle it.
210	00:12:43	00:12:46	I got a feeling that's all you're going to find.
211	00:12:46	00:12:47	What is it?
212	00:12:47	00:12:48	No idea, Jules. That's your next job.
213	00:12:48	00:12:51	So annoying.
214	00:12:53	00:12:56	LVPD! Open up!
215	00:12:56	00:12:57	Can I help you?
216	00:12:57	00:12:59	Yeah, yeah.
217	00:12:59	00:13:01	We're with the Crime Lab, and we're looking for this guy.
218	00:13:01	00:13:02	You seen him around?
219	00:13:02	00:13:03	Um, no.
220	00:13:03	00:13:06	Never seen him before.
221	00:13:06	00:13:09	You mind if we come in and take a look around?
222	00:13:09	00:13:10	Yeah, I do mind.
223	00:13:10	00:13:13	That wasn't really a question.
224	00:13:13	00:13:16	This is hotel property; we have the authority.
225	00:13:16	00:13:17	Step aside.
226	00:13:30	00:13:33	Size 13s?
227	00:13:33	00:13:34	You look like you're no more than a ten, tops.
228	00:13:34	00:13:36	Who's your roommate?
229	00:13:36	00:13:39	He's a friend from back home.
230	00:13:39	00:13:42	You got some I.D. on you, bud?
231	00:13:49	00:13:51	Lee Jacobs. Hey.
232	00:13:52	00:13:54	Familiar?
233	00:13:56	00:13:58	What? I didn't do anything wrong.
234	00:13:58	00:14:00	Need a little backup in here, Paul.
235	00:14:00	00:14:03	Check him for weapons.
236	00:14:03	00:14:05	We're looking for your roomie, Jordan Brentson.
237	00:14:05	00:14:06	Yeah, well, he's not here.
238	00:14:06	00:14:08	He took off.
239	00:14:08	00:14:10	Without his shoes and his wallet?
240	00:14:17	00:14:19	You're coming downtown with us.
241	00:14:19	00:14:20	Why don't you grab a jacket.
242	00:14:20	00:14:22	Yeah, well, you know, I know my rights.
243	00:14:22	00:14:24	Anything in plain sight, you don't need a warrant.
244	00:14:24	00:14:26	If you that closet opened, then you should open it.
245	00:14:26	00:14:27	You a lawyer?
246	00:14:27	00:14:29	No.
247	00:14:29	00:14:31	Well, you're gonna need a good one, serving 15 to 20.
248	00:14:34	00:14:37	Okay. I'll get a jacket.
249	00:14:37	00:14:38	Wait, hang on a second.
250	00:14:42	00:14:44	Open it.
251	00:14:49	00:14:52	If this is about the bar fight in Ashtabula, dude hit me first.
252	00:14:52	00:14:54	Get your ass out of there.
253	00:14:54	00:14:56	Take a nice picture, Jordan.
254	00:14:56	00:14:59	That might look like me, but that's not me.
255	00:14:59	00:15:02	Look, the guy's got a gun.
256	00:15:02	00:15:04	I'm opposed to guns, the whole Second Amendment thing.
257	00:15:04	00:15:06	That's you, Jordan.
258	00:15:06	00:15:08	Your girlfriend Shelley-- she already gave you away, man.
259	00:15:08	00:15:10	Who's Shelley?
260	00:15:10	00:15:12	Really?
261	00:15:12	00:15:14	Let me show you something.
262	00:15:21	00:15:23	I want to get this on record.
263	00:15:23	00:15:26	Say, This is not a one-night stand.
264	00:15:28	00:15:31	This is not a one-night stand.
265	00:15:33	00:15:34	No, no, no!
266	00:15:34	00:15:40	Now say, I promise to take Shelley to dinner tomorrow night.
267	00:15:40	00:15:45	I promise to take this gorgeous piece of ass to any damn place she wants.
268	00:15:45	00:15:48	Ooh. (laughs)
269	00:15:48	00:15:50	As long as it's under two bills. Hey!
270	00:15:52	00:15:54	Chick's smokin', but that's not me.
271	00:15:54	00:15:56	You met her in the bar last night.
272	00:15:56	00:15:57	We found your DNA in her room.
273	00:15:57	00:15:59	And you robbed this guy.
274	00:15:59	00:16:01	We found your blood in the casino.
275	00:16:01	00:16:03	Now, why'd you shoot him? Because he resisted?
276	00:16:03	00:16:06	I didn't shoot anybody.
277	00:16:06	00:16:09	30 a.m. this morning?
278	00:16:09	00:16:10	I don't know. Out.
279	00:16:10	00:16:12	Having a good time.
280	00:16:12	00:16:14	I won a free trip to Vegas; I'm going to enjoy it.
281	00:16:14	00:16:17	Can anyone verify that?
282	00:16:17	00:16:18	No.
283	00:16:18	00:16:20	I was alone.
284	00:16:20	00:16:23	Just like you were alone last night... not with Shelley.
285	00:16:23	00:16:25	I'm telling you, I don't know her.
286	00:16:25	00:16:27	Last night, I was with my buddy Lee.
287	00:16:27	00:16:29	Where'd you guys go?
288	00:16:29	00:16:31	Ballgame. The 51's.
289	00:16:31	00:16:34	We didn't get back to the hotel till midnight.
290	00:16:34	00:16:38	Look, I'm telling you, that is not me.
291	00:16:46	00:16:47	Hey, Arch.
292	00:16:47	00:16:49	How's it going?
293	00:16:50	00:16:51	I'm going blind.
294	00:16:51	00:16:57	Yeah, well, you can give your eyes a rest just as soon as you make a liar out of Jordan and place him at the bar last night with Shelley.
295	00:16:57	00:16:58	Well, already did that.
296	00:16:59	00:17:01	Casino bar.
297	00:17:01	00:17:03	Just after midnight.
298	00:17:03	00:17:04	Just where he said he wasn't.
299	00:17:04	00:17:05	Gotcha.
300	00:17:05	00:17:08	Well, gotcha a problem.
301	00:17:10	00:17:11	Same time.
302	00:17:11	00:17:13	Same guy.
303	00:17:13	00:17:15	Coming into the hotel with his friend.
304	00:17:15	00:17:17	Just where he said he was.
305	00:17:17	00:17:19	How could a guy be in two places at the same time?
306	00:17:19	00:17:22	He can't.
307	00:17:26	00:17:28	I know, I know that.
308	00:17:28	00:17:31	Sweetheart, that's not what I'm saying.
309	00:17:31	00:17:33	I'm...
310	00:17:33	00:17:35	Well, tell them I'm sorry I missed the breakfast.
311	00:17:35	00:17:37	They'll understand that.
312	00:17:37	00:17:38	My in-laws are in town.
313	00:17:38	00:17:41	Hey, here's what we'll do, all right?
314	00:17:41	00:17:43	Let's take them out to dinner on their way to the airport.
315	00:17:43	00:17:45	They'd like that.
316	00:17:45	00:17:47	All right, I love you, too.
317	00:17:48	00:17:50	I love my wife's parents, but, oh, Lord.
318	00:17:50	00:17:53	Houseguests and fish-- after three days, they got to go.
319	00:17:53	00:17:55	All right, who's up?
320	00:17:55	00:17:56	Me.
321	00:17:56	00:18:03	Uh, DNA from Jordan Brentson was a match to the blood at the crime scene, as well as the semen in the condom in Shelley's room.
322	00:18:03	00:18:04	He's our shooter.
323	00:18:04	00:18:09	I hate to rain on your conviction there, Gilligan, but the fingerprint on the condom wrapper was not a match to Jordan.
324	00:18:09	00:18:11	Same DNA and different fingerprints...
325	00:18:11	00:18:13	Would you like to hear my theory?
326	00:18:13	00:18:14	Yes, please.
327	00:18:14	00:18:15	Identical crime twins.
328	00:18:15	00:18:18	(snickers) You should check Jordan's birth records.
329	00:18:18	00:18:20	Already did that.
330	00:18:20	00:18:24	According to Columbus General, Jordan Brentson was a single birth.
331	00:18:24	00:18:26	Guy's an only child.
332	00:18:26	00:18:28	Ouch. You got another theory?
333	00:18:28	00:18:29	Doppelganger.
334	00:18:29	00:18:30	Mm-hmm. In doppel polo shirts?
335	00:18:30	00:18:32	Well, that's how doppelgangers roll.
336	00:18:32	00:18:34	Doppelganger, identical twins separated birth.
337	00:18:34	00:18:38	Either way, I had Archie track Shelley and her date after they left the bar.
338	00:18:38	00:18:41	Our guy's getting cash from the casino ATM.
339	00:18:44	00:18:45	Xavier Marx.
340	00:18:45	00:18:48	Tucson address.
341	00:18:52	00:18:54	Xavier Marx checked into the hotel on Friday.
342	00:18:54	00:18:58	According to his room bill, the only thing he's been doing since then is watching porn.
343	00:18:58	00:19:00	Guess murder makes him horny.
344	00:19:03	00:19:04	Las Vegas Police!
345	00:19:04	00:19:06	Open up!
346	00:19:06	00:19:08	Can you come back in an hour?
347	00:19:08	00:19:09	Let me see that key.
348	00:19:14	00:19:16	Whoa. What the hell?
349	00:19:18	00:19:19	You married or something?
350	00:19:19	00:19:21	Talk about seeing double.
351	00:19:21	00:19:23	You Xavier Marx? Yeah, that's right.
352	00:19:23	00:19:25	Put some clothes on, man; you're coming with us.
353	00:19:25	00:19:27	You sure know how to wreck a party.
354	00:19:28	00:19:29	Or you can join in, handsome.
355	00:19:29	00:19:30	Uh...
356	00:19:30	00:19:31	You into twins, Mr. Marx?
357	00:19:31	00:19:34	Oh, come on, who isn't?
358	00:19:34	00:19:35	Right, Officer?
359	00:19:35	00:19:38	Just get dressed, dude.
360	00:19:38	00:19:40	I don't know a Jordan Brentson.
361	00:19:40	00:19:41	I don't have a brother.
362	00:19:41	00:19:43	I'm an only child.
363	00:19:43	00:19:45	You're telling me that you weren't born September 18, 1987?
364	00:19:45	00:19:46	A Virgo?
365	00:19:46	00:19:48	No. I'm a Gemini.
366	00:19:48	00:19:49	Of course you are.
367	00:19:49	00:19:51	May 22, 1989.
368	00:19:51	00:19:52	Hammond, Louisiana.
369	00:19:52	00:19:54	St. Joe's Hospital.
370	00:19:54	00:19:55	Look it up.
371	00:19:55	00:19:56	What are you doing in Vegas?
372	00:19:56	00:19:58	I won a free trip on the Internet.
373	00:19:58	00:20:00	All expenses paid.
374	00:20:00	00:20:02	You know him?
375	00:20:02	00:20:04	No.
376	00:20:04	00:20:05	Who is he?
377	00:20:05	00:20:06	He's the guy you shot this morning.
378	00:20:06	00:20:08	Excuse me?
379	00:20:08	00:20:10	I think you saw what I was doing this morning.
380	00:20:10	00:20:11	All morning?
381	00:20:11	00:20:13	Twins are very demanding.
382	00:20:13	00:20:15	I think I remember at one point, I had to step out.
383	00:20:15	00:20:17	For a smoke.
384	00:20:17	00:20:19	So when was that?
385	00:20:19	00:20:23	All I know is, it was after the strawberries and the caramel sauce were delivered.
386	00:20:23	00:20:27	You should check with room service.
387	00:20:27	00:20:30	I don't care what these guys say, they're identical twins.
388	00:20:30	00:20:32	How do you explain the birth records not matching up?
389	00:20:32	00:20:33	Well, they're probably fake.
390	00:20:33	00:20:35	Look, they both have criminal records...
391	00:20:35	00:20:36	Dressed the same.
392	00:20:36	00:20:38	Both in Vegas the same time.
393	00:20:38	00:20:40	Both claiming to have won free trips online.
394	00:20:40	00:20:41	I'm with Sara. It's a scam.
395	00:20:41	00:20:43	What about their alibis?
396	00:20:43	00:20:45	So far, we can't verify either one of them.
397	00:20:45	00:20:46	They have to know each other.
398	00:20:46	00:20:47	They have to have planned this.
399	00:20:47	00:20:49	It's the perfect crime.
400	00:20:49	00:20:51	Twins defense.
401	00:20:51	00:20:54	Identical DNA, no way to prove which one pulled the trigger.
402	00:20:54	00:20:56	There is one way.
403	00:20:56	00:21:00	Antibody profiling.
404	00:21:00	00:21:02	I didn't even know we had all this stuff.
405	00:21:02	00:21:03	Guess it doesn't get much use anymore.
406	00:21:03	00:21:05	So you haven't used antibody profiling in a while, huh?
407	00:21:05	00:21:10	I mean, I know it's a procedure that's not used that much, but I've read some journal abstracts.
408	00:21:10	00:21:12	It's kind of like DNA, right?
409	00:21:12	00:21:14	It's different, but in a lot of ways, it's better.
410	00:21:14	00:21:18	Right, because every person develops their own unique antibody profile in response to their environment.
411	00:21:18	00:21:23	Yeah, so even identical twins can have the same DNA, but different antibody profiles.
412	00:21:23	00:21:29	Okay, so when we are done, we are gonna know which one of these twins left their blood on the casino floor.
413	00:21:29	00:21:31	Which one is our killer. Mm.
414	00:22:34	00:22:37	You and Finn find us our twin?
415	00:22:37	00:22:41	Well, actually, we found a little more than we bargained for.
416	00:22:41	00:22:42	What do you mean?
417	00:22:46	00:22:50	Antibody profiling didn't match either suspect?
418	00:22:50	00:22:54	Jordan and Xavier are off the hook.
419	00:22:54	00:22:58	Well, someone with their DNA put a bullet into Dr. Kiel.
420	00:22:58	00:22:59	Yeah, agreed.
421	00:22:59	00:23:01	So, what are you saying?
422	00:23:01	00:23:03	We've got a third one now?
423	00:23:03	00:23:05	Look on the bright side.
424	00:23:05	00:23:07	At least we still know who we're looking for.
425	00:23:13	00:23:17	Okay, so, we're talking identical crime triplets?
426	00:23:17	00:23:25	Oh, not quite. If we go by the birth records, our twins, maybe even our mystery triplet, were born at different times and in different places.
427	00:23:25	00:23:28	So we're talking about in-vitro fertilization, right?
428	00:23:28	00:23:30	I mean, frozen embryos.
429	00:23:30	00:23:36	That's the only way you can get identical triplets from one set of parents born to three different families.
430	00:23:36	00:23:38	In different years and in different cities.
431	00:23:38	00:23:42	So, we're saying, one fertilized embryo split three ways.
432	00:23:42	00:23:43	Is that even possible?
433	00:23:43	00:23:45	Some might call it a miracle.
434	00:23:45	00:23:46	You know what this reminds me of?
435	00:23:46	00:23:48	What? That movie.
436	00:23:48	00:23:50	Um, Gregory Peck.
437	00:23:50	00:23:52	Uh, We're gonna build our own New World.
438	00:23:52	00:23:55	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um... Boys From Brazil.
439	00:23:55	00:23:56	Yup. Right here in Vegas.
440	00:23:56	00:23:59	That movie is about cloning. Hitler.
441	00:23:59	00:24:04	Right? Yeah, yeah, but it's also about a doctor who played God.
442	00:24:04	00:24:07	Yeah, but our victim, Dr. Kiel, was a pediatrician, not an IVF guy.
443	00:24:07	00:24:10	All right, but do we know if he was always a pediatrician, you know?
444	00:24:10	00:24:13	Where did he do his internship? What was his first job?
445	00:24:13	00:24:14	I want to know more about this guy.
446	00:24:14	00:24:16	I'm on it.
447	00:24:16	00:24:21	That movie is also about planning. In this case, these guys weren't planning the Fourth Reich, but they...
448	00:24:21	00:24:23	They were planning a murder. Yes.
449	00:24:23	00:24:24	And how to get away with it.
450	00:24:24	00:24:28	And they still think they've pulled off the perfect crime, right?
451	00:24:28	00:24:29	They can hide behind their DNA.
452	00:24:29	00:24:30	Which makes them overconfident.
453	00:24:30	00:24:33	That third guy is probably trying to wait us out.
454	00:24:33	00:24:34	And I bet I know where.
455	00:24:34	00:24:35	Diamond Dust Casino.
456	00:24:35	00:24:37	Yeah. All right. (phone chirps)
457	00:24:37	00:24:39	You better fire up his facial recognition, right?
458	00:24:39	00:24:42	Like Henry said, at least we know who we're looking for.
459	00:24:42	00:24:43	What?
460	00:24:45	00:24:48	Jordan Brentson's lawyer just walked into PD.
461	00:24:49	00:24:51	She's also his mother.
462	00:24:51	00:24:53	My son Jordan called me from jail.
463	00:24:53	00:24:56	It's not the first time.
464	00:24:56	00:24:57	He's had his...
465	00:24:57	00:24:59	troubles with the law.
466	00:24:59	00:25:01	But he's never been accused of murder.
467	00:25:01	00:25:02	Conspiracy, actually.
468	00:25:02	00:25:07	He had a partner. Well, partners.
469	00:25:07	00:25:08	Look at this.
470	00:25:08	00:25:11	Seeing double?
471	00:25:11	00:25:12	'Cause we are.
472	00:25:12	00:25:13	I don't understand.
473	00:25:13	00:25:19	Maybe this will help. Um, do you recognize this man?
474	00:25:19	00:25:21	I've never seen him before.
475	00:25:21	00:25:24	I get it. It's... It's been, what, 25 years?
476	00:25:25	00:25:27	It must be...
477	00:25:27	00:25:31	very hard wanting a child so much.
478	00:25:31	00:25:33	The struggle to conceive.
479	00:25:33	00:25:36	And then a miracle happens.
480	00:25:41	00:25:43	It was a miracle.
481	00:25:43	00:25:45	And then some.
482	00:25:45	00:25:46	A single embryo split three ways.
483	00:25:46	00:25:50	The doctors told me there were multiples.
484	00:25:54	00:25:58	But I told them that I...
485	00:25:58	00:26:00	I could only care for one child.
486	00:26:02	00:26:04	It was the hardest decision of my life.
487	00:26:04	00:26:08	So, you instructed the clinic to dispose of the other embryos?
488	00:26:08	00:26:11	That's right.
489	00:26:12	00:26:15	A mother knows her son.
490	00:26:15	00:26:17	It's way beyond biology.
491	00:26:19	00:26:24	I would know Jordan anywhere.
492	00:26:24	00:26:27	But this boy-- I don't him.
493	00:26:28	00:26:31	I want to see my son.
494	00:26:31	00:26:34	I looked into Dr. Kiel's work history.
495	00:26:34	00:26:35	Russell's hunch was right.
496	00:26:35	00:26:40	Before he was a pediatrician, he did an internship at an IVF clinic in Columbus, Ohio.
497	00:26:40	00:26:43	Vivian and Jordan Brentson's home town.
498	00:26:43	00:26:45	You think she's lying? You think she knew Kiel?
499	00:26:45	00:26:47	I think she's more than lying.
500	00:26:47	00:26:49	I think we're looking at a modern Ma Barker here.
501	00:26:49	00:26:51	You know, Ma Barker had four sons.
502	00:26:51	00:26:53	Herman, Lloyd, Arthur and Fred.
503	00:26:53	00:26:56	Masterminded her own Little Crime House on the Prairie.
504	00:26:56	00:26:59	Wow. You're like a World Book of Crime.
505	00:26:59	00:27:03	Well, I'm, like, not impressed with her story.
506	00:27:03	00:27:05	I don't know. I mean, she's a defense attorney.
507	00:27:05	00:27:06	She's not a criminal.
508	00:27:06	00:27:07	I don't see the distinction.
509	00:27:07	00:27:09	And I see plenty of motive.
510	00:27:09	00:27:11	She had a kid in a dish, wanted the extras tossed.
511	00:27:11	00:27:13	Somehow found out they weren't.
512	00:27:13	00:27:16	Blamed the doctor for playing God, and giving away what was hers.
513	00:27:16	00:27:19	Then Ma Barker rounds up her boys for payback.
514	00:27:19	00:27:22	Well, like you said, she's a defense attorney.
515	00:27:22	00:27:23	Pretty good plan.
516	00:27:23	00:27:26	Unless we catch the shooter.
517	00:27:40	00:27:42	Fire in the hole!
518	00:28:13	00:28:14	Lose something?
519	00:28:14	00:28:19	No. I think I found the answer to our ballistics mystery.
520	00:28:19	00:28:20	Oh, yeah?
521	00:28:20	00:28:22	Our little red hourglass.
522	00:28:22	00:28:24	Found only in No-Rico Shells.
523	00:28:24	00:28:26	As in, no ricochet.
524	00:28:26	00:28:29	It's the exact type of bullet our killer used.
525	00:28:29	00:28:31	They were originally developed for air marshals.
526	00:28:31	00:28:34	So that it doesn't go through-and-through and puncture the fuselage.
527	00:28:35	00:28:37	No-Rico shell breaks up on impact.
528	00:28:37	00:28:44	The hourglass tip is like a cork that pops and releases a lethal shotgun blast of pellets.
529	00:28:44	00:28:49	Okay, well, that would explain Dr. Kiel's macerated liver. Yeah.
530	00:28:49	00:28:52	What do you think? We're looking for an air marshal?
531	00:28:52	00:28:54	Or at least an air marshal's gun.
532	00:29:01	00:29:04	Hey, Arch, you still on the hunt for the third man? (sighs)
533	00:29:04	00:29:06	Yeah, going into hour 14.
534	00:29:06	00:29:08	Can't take a break till I find him.
535	00:29:08	00:29:10	Hey, I think I got something.
536	00:29:10	00:29:13	Those free trips to Vegas our suspects won...
537	00:29:13	00:29:15	At first, I thought it was just a line they were using.
538	00:29:15	00:29:21	Then I thought, if they've been so careful to create so many cover stories, maybe they created a free trip to cover their tracks.
539	00:29:21	00:29:22	Which they did?
540	00:29:22	00:29:24	Checked with the hotel.
541	00:29:24	00:29:26	Three trips were booked online via Sunview Travel.
542	00:29:26	00:29:32	Sent via e-mail to Jordan Brentson, Xavier Marx and again, a familiar face. Kevin Chance.
543	00:29:32	00:29:33	Minneapolis address.
544	00:29:33	00:29:35	Check out the birth date on the license.
545	00:29:35	00:29:37	July 30, 1989.
546	00:29:37	00:29:39	Makes him the youngest, and a criminal record.
547	00:29:39	00:29:40	Interesting employment history, too.
548	00:29:40	00:29:44	Before being dropped for drunk and disorderly, he was training to be an air marshal.
549	00:29:44	00:29:46	I think we got our shooter.
550	00:29:46	00:29:50	And according to the Diamond Dust Casino, he's still checked in-- room 2211.
551	00:29:50	00:29:52	LVPD! Show me your hands!
552	00:29:52	00:29:54	Hands!
553	00:29:54	00:29:56	Heard the man, Mr. Chance. Hands on your head.
554	00:30:11	00:30:13	Yeah, he's ice cold.
555	00:30:13	00:30:16	He's been dead for a while.
556	00:30:16	00:30:18	Looks like an overdose.
557	00:30:22	00:30:23	Credit cards.
558	00:30:23	00:30:25	Belong to Dr. Kiel.
559	00:30:29	00:30:32	Smith &amp; Wesson .38, just like the murder weapon.
560	00:30:32	00:30:34	No-Rico Shells.
561	00:30:34	00:30:37	Same as the shells we pulled out of that the slot machine and Dr. Kiel.
562	00:30:48	00:30:49	I killed Dr. Kiel.
563	00:30:49	00:30:51	He's to blame.
564	00:30:51	00:30:56	If it wasn't for him playing God, I wouldn't have existed.
565	00:30:56	00:30:58	Had the miserable life that I've had.
566	00:30:58	00:31:02	This whole thing was my idea.
567	00:31:02	00:31:07	I thought that killing Dr. Kiel was the answer.
568	00:31:07	00:31:09	But this...
569	00:31:10	00:31:13	This...
570	00:31:13	00:31:15	This is the answer.
571	00:31:30	00:31:32	Do you think this is our answer?
572	00:31:32	00:31:36	We've been chasing the wrong guy this whole time.
573	00:31:36	00:31:39	Why should we have the right one now?
574	00:31:45	00:31:49	Preliminary tox indicates Kevin Chance died from a massive overdose of alprazolam and alcohol.
575	00:31:49	00:31:51	Well, that fits with the suicide video.
576	00:31:51	00:31:55	Right? I'm not sure that video captured the whole story.
577	00:31:55	00:31:58	What do you mean? I found signs of blunt-force trauma.
578	00:31:58	00:32:01	Looks like a blow to the head.
579	00:32:01	00:32:05	And I also dissected the victim's neck.
580	00:32:05	00:32:06	See the abrasions on his trachea?
581	00:32:06	00:32:08	Look like circular patterns.
582	00:32:08	00:32:14	The diameter's consistent with the mouth of a bottle-- say a bottle of Scotch shoved down his throat.
583	00:32:14	00:32:19	As for pills, I found no solid remnants in his stomach.
584	00:32:19	00:32:23	Ah. Well, how-how did the drugs get into his system, then?
585	00:32:23	00:32:28	Henry tested the Scotch bottle and found toxic levels of alprazolam.
586	00:32:28	00:32:33	So, somebody ground up the pills, dissolved them, spiked the drink...
587	00:32:33	00:32:34	And faked the video.
588	00:32:34	00:32:36	What do you estimate time of death?
589	00:32:36	00:32:39	Approximately 12 hours ago.
590	00:32:39	00:32:44	About an hour after the shooting of Dr. Kiel, while we were still chasing our tails.
591	00:32:44	00:32:47	Yeah, I smell the twins at work here.
592	00:33:00	00:33:02	Did you get it?
593	00:33:02	00:33:08	Yeah, well, Kevin didn't shove that bottle down his own throat, and he didn't make the bogus suicide video.
594	00:33:08	00:33:11	Right, but whoever did, maybe they left behind some touch DNA.
595	00:33:11	00:33:14	And their antibodies. Yeah.
596	00:33:14	00:33:16	I'll get Henry on it.
597	00:33:17	00:33:19	Hey, Morgan, I got your text.
598	00:33:19	00:33:21	What's up? You and Sara were right.
599	00:33:21	00:33:23	Doc Robbins said the suicide was fake.
600	00:33:23	00:33:25	So much for brotherly love.
601	00:33:25	00:33:26	Well, I do have some love.
602	00:33:26	00:33:29	I figured out who bought those free trips to Vegas.
603	00:33:29	00:33:30	Yeah, who's that?
604	00:33:30	00:33:34	Dr. Kiel. Booked his own vacation with his son at the same time.
605	00:33:34	00:33:35	Take a look at this.
606	00:33:35	00:33:38	I got these files off of his computer.
607	00:33:38	00:33:41	For the past few months, Kiel's been keeping track of the triplets.
608	00:33:41	00:33:45	Got the contact information for the parents who received the embryos.
609	00:33:45	00:33:46	And he took it from there and tracked them down.
610	00:33:46	00:33:48	But for what?
611	00:33:48	00:33:50	Some kind of weird embryo doctor reunion?
612	00:33:50	00:33:51	I mean, why do it?
613	00:33:51	00:33:55	Jordan's mother said that the clinic was supposed to destroy the embryos.
614	00:33:55	00:33:57	But, obviously, Kiel didn't follow through.
615	00:33:57	00:34:01	Based on these criminal records, these triplets' lives didn't go so well.
616	00:34:01	00:34:05	And you think that Kiel felt guilty and was trying to make it right somehow?
617	00:34:05	00:34:06	Take a look at this.
618	00:34:06	00:34:09	Two days before he was murdered, Kiel withdrew 150 grand.
619	00:34:09	00:34:12	Compensation for pain and suffering. But maybe not enough.
620	00:34:12	00:34:14	He was a very successful pediatrician.
621	00:34:14	00:34:15	A rich man.
622	00:34:15	00:34:18	With one unethical chapter in his past.
623	00:34:18	00:34:21	He makes a great target for blackmail.
624	00:34:21	00:34:22	Blackmail gone bad.
625	00:34:27	00:34:28	I heard Russell put you back to work.
626	00:34:28	00:34:29	Yeah.
627	00:34:29	00:34:31	What'd you find?
628	00:34:31	00:34:34	This is good.
629	00:34:34	00:34:38	Profiling confirms it was Kevin Chance's blood on the casino floor. We have our shooter.
630	00:34:38	00:34:39	Look at page two.
631	00:34:39	00:34:43	Antibody results on the scotch bottle from the touch DNA.
632	00:34:43	00:34:45	You've got to be kidding me.
633	00:34:45	00:34:46	There's a fourth man?
634	00:34:46	00:34:50	Yep. Antibodies on the bottle excluded Kevin, Jordan, and Xavier.
635	00:34:50	00:34:52	You're telling me that we're looking for quadruplets?
636	00:34:52	00:34:55	Yeah. Number four is alive and well, and dressed to kill.
637	00:34:55	00:34:57	I'm guessing in an orange polo and blue jeans.
638	00:34:57	00:34:59	Do you think he's still at the hotel?
639	00:34:59	00:35:02	Well, Archie's got facial recognition watching all the exits, so he has to be.
640	00:35:02	00:35:04	Where are you going?
641	00:35:04	00:35:09	If Kiel arranged the reunion, it stands to reason that he met with those guys before they killed him.
642	00:35:09	00:35:10	Okay, so?
643	00:35:10	00:35:12	So maybe we have a witness.
644	00:35:17	00:35:19	Can I give you a hand?
645	00:35:19	00:35:22	Got it. Thanks.
646	00:35:23	00:35:25	The policeman said you found the man.
647	00:35:25	00:35:27	We did.
648	00:35:28	00:35:30	You know, you told me that, um...
649	00:35:30	00:35:34	your dad brought you here to see Kanye.
650	00:35:34	00:35:38	Did he have any other reason to be in Vegas? He did say there were some people he was gonna meet.
651	00:35:38	00:35:40	Did you meet them?
652	00:35:40	00:35:42	When they were coming over, he gave me money...
653	00:35:42	00:35:45	told me to go to the arcade.
654	00:35:45	00:35:46	So that's a no?
655	00:35:46	00:35:49	I did come back a little early.
656	00:35:49	00:35:51	Saw him talking to these two guys.
657	00:35:51	00:35:53	It was really weird.
658	00:35:53	00:35:56	They looked exactly alike, even dressed alike.
659	00:35:58	00:36:00	Did they look like this?
660	00:36:01	00:36:03	Yeah.
661	00:36:03	00:36:04	I asked my dad about them.
662	00:36:04	00:36:07	He told me they had two brothers-- they all looked alike.
663	00:36:07	00:36:09	My dad...
664	00:36:09	00:36:11	helped deliver them as babies.
665	00:36:12	00:36:15	Was it one of them?
666	00:36:15	00:36:16	Yeah...
667	00:36:16	00:36:19	it was.
668	00:36:19	00:36:21	Listen, um...
669	00:36:22	00:36:25	we were able to contact your family in Wisconsin.
670	00:36:25	00:36:27	And you're gonna be staying with them for a while.
671	00:36:27	00:36:29	I don't want to go to Wisconsin.
672	00:36:31	00:36:34	I'm sorry.
673	00:36:36	00:36:39	You know, um...
674	00:36:39	00:36:42	I could really...
675	00:36:42	00:36:46	go for an ice cream right now. There's, um, a great place downstairs.
676	00:36:46	00:36:48	Would you like some ice cream?
677	00:36:48	00:36:50	Sure.
678	00:36:54	00:37:00	Earning your money on this one, huh, Arch? Oh, man, I am so sick of looking for this face.
679	00:37:00	00:37:02	Well, look at the bright side.
680	00:37:02	00:37:04	Oh, we still know who we're looking for.
681	00:37:04	00:37:06	Ha, ha, ha.
682	00:37:06	00:37:10	Yeah, man, I am tired of that joke and I am getting really tired here.
683	00:37:10	00:37:12	Whoa.
684	00:37:12	00:37:14	Got a hit.
685	00:37:17	00:37:19	How is it? Good. Thanks.
686	00:37:19	00:37:21	Yours? Good.
687	00:37:21	00:37:23	(phone rings) Oh.
688	00:37:23	00:37:28	Excuse me for a second Hey, Nick. What's up?
689	00:37:28	00:37:29	We got a hit on our suspect.
690	00:37:29	00:37:31	Where is he?
691	00:37:31	00:37:33	Sitting right behind you, eating ice cream.
692	00:37:36	00:37:37	Are you sure?
693	00:37:37	00:37:42	Relative position of features, proportionality, by age ten, facial metrics are set.
694	00:37:42	00:37:44	Yeah, I'm sure. We're sure.
695	00:37:51	00:37:53	You all done?
696	00:37:53	00:37:55	Yeah.
697	00:37:55	00:37:57	I'll take that.
698	00:37:59	00:38:02	Can we go now?
699	00:38:02	00:38:04	Yeah.
700	00:38:09	00:38:11	So we ran your DNA, Avery.
701	00:38:11	00:38:14	Big surprise-- it matched your brothers.
702	00:38:14	00:38:16	I guess you could call them brothers, certainly brothers in crime.
703	00:38:16	00:38:19	We thought it was your dad that arranged those free trips.
704	00:38:19	00:38:28	Turns out it was you. Contacted the ISP, while you were booking flights and hotels, you were also doing a little shopping online-- skateboard, video games...
705	00:38:28	00:38:31	oh yeah, and a nice new pair of kicks.
706	00:38:31	00:38:33	So I guess you like spending your old man's money.
707	00:38:33	00:38:38	Uh, just like when we found you at the hotel running up the room service bill on cake and ice cream. This weekend's my birthday.
708	00:38:38	00:38:43	I told you my dad liked to buy me stuff. Well, forget cake and ice cream. Forget sneakers.
709	00:38:43	00:38:45	Your dad's a rich man.
710	00:38:45	00:38:47	You're the sole beneficiary in his will.
711	00:38:47	00:38:50	You have 25k a year until you're 18, six million bucks.
712	00:38:50	00:38:52	I don't know anything about that.
713	00:38:52	00:39:02	What about the $150,000 transferred from your dad's savings into a money market, with two payments scheduled for exactly 24 hours after he was murdered?
714	00:39:02	00:39:07	75K goes to your bro, Jordan Brentson and 75K to your other bro, Xavier Marx.
715	00:39:07	00:39:09	Poor Kevin got stiffed. And let me guess.
716	00:39:09	00:39:13	He wanted a bigger cut for being the trigger man, and that didn't sit well with the family.
717	00:39:13	00:39:15	I'm the one who took the risk.
718	00:39:15	00:39:17	I was the one who pulled the trigger.
719	00:39:17	00:39:18	It was my ass hanging out there.
720	00:39:18	00:39:20	Still is.
721	00:39:20	00:39:24	How do you guys feel about splitting 150K two ways?
722	00:39:29	00:39:31	Whose idea was it to make it look like a suicide?
723	00:39:31	00:39:32	Yours?
724	00:39:33	00:39:35	We all have the same DNA.
725	00:39:35	00:39:38	There's no way of knowing who was in that room.
726	00:39:38	00:39:39	That's the thing, Avery.
727	00:39:39	00:39:40	We do know.
728	00:39:40	00:39:42	You planned this very well.
729	00:39:42	00:39:45	You knew you could hide behind the DNA, but you missed something.
730	00:39:45	00:39:47	It's called antibody profiling.
731	00:39:47	00:39:52	And that puts that bottle of scotch that was jammed down Kevin Chance's throat in your hands.
732	00:40:03	00:40:07	There was some bad seed in that petri dish.
733	00:40:07	00:40:09	This couldn't have been just all about the money.
734	00:40:09	00:40:12	You wouldn't understand.
735	00:40:12	00:40:14	Try me.
736	00:40:16	00:40:18	When my mom died...
737	00:40:18	00:40:23	at the funeral, I heard my cousins talking about how sad it was that she couldn't get pregnant.
738	00:40:23	00:40:27	How she had to go and thaw out somebody else's kid to put in her.
739	00:40:28	00:40:30	I confronted my dad.
740	00:40:30	00:40:34	He told me about the four brothers, all from one embryo.
741	00:40:34	00:40:36	Identical, perfect.
742	00:40:36	00:40:39	He had taken the last one.
743	00:40:39	00:40:40	Given it life.
744	00:40:40	00:40:42	Me.
745	00:40:42	00:40:44	I was his final miracle.
746	00:40:44	00:40:46	What miracle?
747	00:40:46	00:40:48	It was all a lie.
748	00:40:48	00:40:51	Still doesn't explain what you did.
749	00:40:51	00:40:53	My dad...
750	00:40:53	00:40:56	was always so cold.
751	00:40:56	00:40:58	Now I know why.
752	00:40:58	00:41:00	My mom's the only one who really loved me.
753	00:41:00	00:41:03	And she wasn't even my mom.
754	00:41:03	00:41:07	And that day she was taken away from me again...
755	00:41:07	00:41:10	I blame him.
756	00:41:12	00:41:15	I'm 12 years old...
757	00:41:15	00:41:17	what jury's gonna put me away?
758	00:41:17	00:41:19	Don't be so sure.
759	00:41:19	00:41:24	Last year an 11-year-old boy was put away for murder, life without parole.
760	00:41:24	00:41:27	You can help yourself here, Avery.
761	00:41:27	00:41:29	You created the prefect crime.
762	00:41:29	00:41:31	Perfect.
763	00:41:31	00:41:33	Except that it was perfect for Jordan and Xavier.
764	00:41:33	00:41:38	The only physical evidence we have points to Kevin killing your dad...
765	00:41:38	00:41:40	And you killing Kevin.
766	00:41:40	00:41:42	Come on, kid. Save yourself.
767	00:41:42	00:41:44	Give up the twins.
768	00:41:45	00:41:47	No.
769	00:41:47	00:41:50	I'll take my chances.
770	00:41:51	00:41:53	Like you said...
771	00:41:53	00:41:55	they're my brothers.
772	00:41:56	00:41:59	They're my only real family.
