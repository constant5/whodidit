1,00:00:16,00:00:19,(phone ringing)
2,00:00:19,00:00:21,Hello.
3,00:00:21,00:00:23,SIDLE: I heard you cleared your scene. Nice work.
4,00:00:23,00:00:26,"Would you mind, um, picking me up a veggie burger from RJ's on your way back?"
5,00:00:26,00:00:27,I guess. They do have a drive-through.
6,00:00:27,00:00:29,"BRODY: Hey, it's Morgan."
7,00:00:29,00:00:33,"Uh, mind picking up me a veggie burger, too, and Finn a grilled cheese?"
8,00:00:33,00:00:34,"All right, but you ladies are gonna owe me."
9,00:00:34,00:00:36,MORGAN: Thanks.
10,00:00:36,00:00:43,WOMAN: The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for the city of Las Vegas and outlying areas.
11,00:00:43,00:00:46,Winds are expected to reach 50 miles per hour.
12,00:00:46,00:00:51,The Clark County Regional Flood Control Center is keeping a close watch on the storm basins...
13,00:00:51,00:00:54,(groans) It is nasty out there.
14,00:00:54,00:00:56,Can't argue with that.
15,00:00:56,00:00:58,Maybe we shouldn't have sent Greg to get our food.
16,00:00:58,00:01:00,"No, he's a... he's a great swimmer."
17,00:01:00,00:01:01,"ANDREWS: Wait, Greg's on a chow run?"
18,00:01:01,00:01:04,"I could really use some soup. Ooh, or chili."
19,00:01:04,00:01:07,"Yeah, actually you guys are gonna have to fend for yourself out of the refrigerator tonight."
20,00:01:07,00:01:09,"Uh, yeah. Wouldn't be the first time."
21,00:01:09,00:01:10,I knew that was you.
22,00:01:10,00:01:12,"All right, all right, listen up..."
23,00:01:13,00:01:15,Wow.
24,00:01:15,00:01:21,P.D. just pulled a man out of a flood channel with a suspicious head injury; we need to process him.
25,00:01:21,00:01:22,Treat it like a crime until we know otherwise.
26,00:01:22,00:01:24,Who's up next? That'd be me.
27,00:01:24,00:01:26,(clears throat) Sorry.
28,00:01:26,00:01:28,Thank you.
29,00:01:28,00:01:32,"Got a male, early 30s, severe hypothermia and head injuries."
30,00:01:32,00:01:33,"Okay, take him to room three."
31,00:01:33,00:01:35,This your guy from the flood channel?
32,00:01:35,00:01:37,"Yeah, he's lucky his bag got stuck on a tree limb."
33,00:01:37,00:01:39,Kept him from washing further downstream.
34,00:01:39,00:01:41,"Doctor, we need you in room three, stat!"
35,00:01:41,00:01:43,Agonal respirations on contact.
36,00:01:43,00:01:45,"Weak brachial pulse, unable to get a BP."
37,00:01:45,00:01:47,"On three. One, two, three."
38,00:01:47,00:01:49,NURSE: Glucose is 50 mg.
39,00:01:49,00:01:50,Any I.D. on him?
40,00:01:50,00:01:52,"If there is, it'll be in there."
41,00:01:52,00:01:53,DOCTOR: Breathing is shallow but regular.
42,00:01:53,00:01:55,Blood pressure is 85/50. I'll get him on the monitor.
43,00:01:55,00:01:57,EMT: There wasn't any obvious swelling to the head.
44,00:01:57,00:01:58,Laceration's deep.
45,00:01:58,00:01:59,DOCTOR: Make sure we get a core temperature.
46,00:01:59,00:02:01,Let's start by warming him.
47,00:02:01,00:02:02,Then we'll address the head wound.
48,00:02:03,00:02:05,G-Guys?
49,00:02:05,00:02:08,Back out of here slowly and take him with you.
50,00:02:08,00:02:09,What is it?
51,00:02:09,00:02:12,Bomb!
52,00:02:12,00:02:13,And it's armed.
53,00:02:13,00:02:14,It's a bomb.
54,00:03:10,00:03:12,"Control, EOD-one."
55,00:03:12,00:03:14,I have the target in sight.
56,00:03:14,00:03:17,"Can you, uh, confirm that the building is all cleared?"
57,00:03:17,00:03:19,"CONTROL (over radio): EOD-one, Control."
58,00:03:19,00:03:22,Building is clear except EOD personnel and target.
59,00:03:25,00:03:27,How you holding up?
60,00:03:27,00:03:31,Just willed myself not to sneeze.
61,00:03:31,00:03:32,Almost blew us both up.
62,00:03:32,00:03:34,Keep up the sense of humor.
63,00:03:34,00:03:35,I wasn't kidding.
64,00:03:37,00:03:40,Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do.
65,00:03:40,00:03:44,I'm gonna slide my hands underneath that satchel.
66,00:03:44,00:03:46,I'm taking the weight off your arms.
67,00:03:46,00:03:51,"Now, it's crucial that you don't do anything until I tell you, okay?"
68,00:03:51,00:03:54,I'm not about to make any sudden moves.
69,00:03:57,00:03:59,I'm Anthony.
70,00:04:00,00:04:02,Sara.
71,00:04:02,00:04:04,"You're doing great, Sara."
72,00:04:05,00:04:07,Okay.
73,00:04:07,00:04:10,I'm sliding my hands under the satchel.
74,00:04:14,00:04:16,Okay?
75,00:04:16,00:04:21,Now... slowly drop your arms six inches straight down.
76,00:04:21,00:04:22,(thunder cracks)
77,00:04:22,00:04:23,(gasps)
78,00:04:23,00:04:25,It's okay. It's okay.
79,00:04:25,00:04:26,Come back to me.
80,00:04:26,00:04:28,It's okay.
81,00:04:28,00:04:29,Now...
82,00:04:29,00:04:37,"with your arms in that position, slowly walk directly back until you're clear."
83,00:05:10,00:05:14,You sit tight while I take this thing outside.
84,00:05:14,00:05:16,"EOD-one, phase one complete."
85,00:05:16,00:05:19,"UXO's in the portable, in the big bucket in two."
86,00:05:19,00:05:21,I'm gonna need those bomb parts.
87,00:05:21,00:05:23,Copy that.
88,00:05:23,00:05:25,You'll get whatever's left.
89,00:05:35,00:05:37,"(electricity humming, computers beeping)"
90,00:05:41,00:05:44,(muffled explosion in distance)
91,00:05:44,00:05:45,ANTHONY: All clear!
92,00:05:45,00:05:46,(sighs)
93,00:05:46,00:05:48,(thunder rumbling)
94,00:06:07,00:06:08,You Greg Sanders?
95,00:06:08,00:06:10,Yeah.
96,00:06:13,00:06:14,You've been served.
97,00:06:14,00:06:17,Have a nice night.
98,00:06:23,00:06:26,Some guy just served me with papers.
99,00:06:26,00:06:30,"CSI Three Greg Sanders, meet Defense Criminalist Jennifer Rhodes."
100,00:06:30,00:06:36,"Ms. Rhodes is here to review the evidence on People v. Gus Ellis, 2006."
101,00:06:36,00:06:39,"Yeah, that, uh, doesn't ring a bell."
102,00:06:39,00:06:44,"Ms. Rhodes, wh-why don't you give us the Reader's Digest version."
103,00:06:44,00:06:51,Gus Ellis served seven years of a life sentence for the rape/murder of college student Claire Gibson.
104,00:06:51,00:06:56,"Since his case hinged on DNA, it fit the Innocence Project's protocol."
105,00:06:56,00:07:05,"We extracted touch DNA from her jeans and her underwear, which matched that of serial sex offender Clyde Maroni."
106,00:07:05,00:07:07,Testing wasn't sensitive enough for touch DNA back in 2006.
107,00:07:07,00:07:12,Maroni confessed and pled to a life sentence.
108,00:07:12,00:07:14,Now Gus Ellis is free and wants answers.
109,00:07:14,00:07:18,I've been hired by his civil attorney to see the case through.
110,00:07:18,00:07:25,"So, if science proved his innocence through new and improved technology, what's the basis for the lawsuit?"
111,00:07:25,00:07:34,"Well, a week before her murder, Claire Gibson called the police complaining that a man was looking at her through her bedroom window."
112,00:07:34,00:07:37,Gus Ellis was identified as the peeper.
113,00:07:37,00:07:43,I remember that. He was also the one who called 911 from the Gibson murder scene.
114,00:07:43,00:07:50,"He said that he looked through the victim's window, saw her lying there, and claimed she was already dead."
115,00:07:50,00:07:53,"He was arrested that same day, which we call..."
116,00:07:53,00:07:57,a rush to judgment.
117,00:07:57,00:08:02,He was the person of interest in an investigation started by the victim.
118,00:08:02,00:08:06,"A week later, he calls 911 from her murder scene."
119,00:08:06,00:08:10,"No prints, no semen, no evidence linked Mr. Ellis to the inside of that..."
120,00:08:10,00:08:14,I-I remember that there was a crowbar next to her with his blood on it.
121,00:08:14,00:08:19,Mr. Ellis stated that he never went inside that house and he never touched that crowbar.
122,00:08:19,00:08:24,RUSSELL: He claims only way his blood was on that crowbar is if it were planted.
123,00:08:24,00:08:26,What?!
124,00:08:26,00:08:28,He's saying that I planted his blood?
125,00:08:28,00:08:29,How?
126,00:08:29,00:08:34,"A reference blood sample was collected from Mr. Ellis, a blood sample that you received at the scene."
127,00:08:34,00:08:36,(knocking)
128,00:08:36,00:08:37,Come on in.
129,00:08:37,00:08:41,Finlay's gonna be working with Ms. Rhodes on the re-examination.
130,00:08:41,00:08:44,"Until they're finished, I need you on desk duty."
131,00:08:44,00:08:45,(thunder rumbling)
132,00:08:54,00:08:57,(monitor beeping steadily)
133,00:09:00,00:09:02,He's still out.
134,00:09:02,00:09:03,"How you doing, Sara?"
135,00:09:03,00:09:05,I'm a little shaky.
136,00:09:05,00:09:10,Nothing like staring into the abyss for 20 minutes to decide what's important in life.
137,00:09:10,00:09:12,It's sad how it takes something so...
138,00:09:12,00:09:16,"intense to make us stop and smell the coffee, huh?"
139,00:09:16,00:09:19,Bomb guys disrupted the device to render it safe.
140,00:09:19,00:09:21,I sent what was left to Hodges.
141,00:09:21,00:09:24,"Well, police officers are walking the flood channel."
142,00:09:24,00:09:26,It would be good to know how long he was in there.
143,00:09:26,00:09:30,"It only takes ten minutes in 50-degree water to get hypothermia, but he could've been in there longer than that."
144,00:09:30,00:09:32,He got hung up on a tree branch.
145,00:09:32,00:09:35,We need to quickly I.D. him and find out what he planned to do with that bomb.
146,00:09:35,00:09:37,(computer beeps) Oh. I have a match.
147,00:09:37,00:09:39,Uh...
148,00:09:39,00:09:43,"Yeah. Uh, name is Warren Hackett from Atlanta, Georgia."
149,00:09:43,00:09:45,It's not our guy. (groans)
150,00:09:45,00:09:48,473 Snowdrift Lane?
151,00:09:48,00:09:51,"Last time it snowed in Atlanta, I had a fake I.D."
152,00:09:51,00:09:53,Somebody wants to keep this guy's identity a secret.
153,00:09:53,00:09:56,Then we go old-school.
154,00:09:56,00:09:58,Police are asking the public's help in identifying this man.
155,00:09:58,00:10:02,He was pulled from a flood channel tonight in serious condition.
156,00:10:02,00:10:09,"If you have any information about his identity, please call the Las Vegas Police Department."
157,00:10:09,00:10:11,Hey.
158,00:10:11,00:10:14,"Oh, my God. I am so glad to see you in one piece."
159,00:10:14,00:10:15,(chuckles) You and me both.
160,00:10:15,00:10:17,I got you a veggie burger. It's in the fridge if you want.
161,00:10:17,00:10:20,"Thanks. Uh, as soon as I get my appetite back, I'm..."
162,00:10:20,00:10:22,"Right. Well, you can have it later, I guess."
163,00:10:22,00:10:30,"Um, so, I thought in order to find where our bomber went in, we could apply some logic, so I got us a map of all flood channels in Vegas."
164,00:10:30,00:10:33,I'm thinking he fell in the water somewhere near his target.
165,00:10:33,00:10:37,"Okay, if I was a bomber, I would look for someplace with a lot of people."
166,00:10:37,00:10:38,Probably looking at a casino.
167,00:10:38,00:10:41,Guy got pulled out of the water... here.
168,00:10:41,00:10:43,Backtrack upstream.
169,00:10:43,00:10:48,"Closest likely targets are the Tangiers, Queen Regent and Mediterranean. (phone chiming)"
170,00:10:50,00:10:51,Oh. Our John Doe's awake.
171,00:10:51,00:10:54,"I'm, uh, heading back to the hospital."
172,00:10:54,00:10:56,See you later.
173,00:10:59,00:11:01,(coughing)
174,00:11:01,00:11:03,This dust could be toxic!
175,00:11:03,00:11:05,Where's my particle mask? (coughs)
176,00:11:05,00:11:07,You got to die from something.
177,00:11:07,00:11:09,"(groans, coughs)"
178,00:11:09,00:11:14,"Man, Sara held certain death in her hands for 20 minutes and never moved."
179,00:11:14,00:11:17,Do you think it's true that your whole life flashes before your eyes in those situations?
180,00:11:17,00:11:19,Did for me.
181,00:11:19,00:11:21,I'm listening.
182,00:11:21,00:11:23,"I was 18, getting my wisdom teeth pulled."
183,00:11:23,00:11:25,When I got the anesthetic...
184,00:11:25,00:11:27,Malignant hyperthermia from anesthetic can be fatal.
185,00:11:27,00:11:29,They need a crash cart?
186,00:11:29,00:11:30,Not exactly.
187,00:11:30,00:11:32,It was my first experience with a mind-altering drug.
188,00:11:32,00:11:36,"I thought I was dying, began to hyperventilate, hallucinate."
189,00:11:36,00:11:38,And?
190,00:11:38,00:11:43,"In my addled state, I fell madly in love with the dental assistant."
191,00:11:43,00:11:47,"For some reason, I had to tell everyone, including her."
192,00:11:47,00:11:50,"Turns out, it was just an adverse reaction to the drugs."
193,00:11:50,00:11:51,(singsong): Awkward.
194,00:11:51,00:11:53,No. Humiliating.
195,00:11:53,00:11:54,I never went back.
196,00:11:54,00:11:55,I still have my wisdom teeth.
197,00:11:55,00:11:56,You?
198,00:11:56,00:11:59,Perhaps another time.
199,00:11:59,00:12:02,"Why don't you take what's left of the satchel, and I'll concentrate on the bomb frags."
200,00:12:07,00:12:09,MAN: Margarit t'agavorakan.
201,00:12:09,00:12:11,Margarit t'agavorakan.
202,00:12:11,00:12:12,BRASS: That's not English.
203,00:12:12,00:12:14,Sounds Slavic or Russian or something.
204,00:12:14,00:12:16,Keeps saying it the same way over and over again.
205,00:12:16,00:12:18,"Well, hold on, I have a translator app."
206,00:12:18,00:12:19,Maybe we can figure out what he's saying.
207,00:12:22,00:12:24,Margarit t'agavorakan.
208,00:12:24,00:12:26,(phone beeps)
209,00:12:26,00:12:27,Margarit t'agavorakan.
210,00:12:27,00:12:29,He's speaking Armenian.
211,00:12:29,00:12:33,"Margarit means ""pearl."" App doesn't recognize the rest."
212,00:12:33,00:12:39,"Guy with a bomb, speaking a foreign language, possibly in code, hacked into AFIS so we don't identify him."
213,00:12:39,00:12:41,That's a guy with a lot of expertise.
214,00:12:41,00:12:42,That's the profile for a terrorist.
215,00:12:42,00:12:46,One thing I know about terrorists: they never work alone.
216,00:12:52,00:12:54,"Hey, Finn, I'd really like to take a look at my case notes."
217,00:12:54,00:12:56,"Greg, I can't talk to you."
218,00:12:56,00:13:00,I have to remain completely objective while I work with the defense expert.
219,00:13:00,00:13:01,(sighs)
220,00:13:01,00:13:05,"FINLAY: Greg Sanders worked this case solo, so all of the photographs are his."
221,00:13:05,00:13:12,"The left screen shows the digital code-- shot sequence, date, time, any edits or deletions."
222,00:13:12,00:13:15,So we can tell if any of the photographs have been altered.
223,00:13:15,00:13:19,"Greg started by photographing the exterior of the crime scene first, which is protocol."
224,00:13:19,00:13:23,Shots were almost two minutes apart.
225,00:13:23,00:13:26,Looks like he finished the exteriors just after 0600.
226,00:13:26,00:13:29,"Now he's moved on, inside the house."
227,00:13:29,00:13:31,Starting with the body in the bedroom.
228,00:13:31,00:13:36,"When I was working crime scenes back in Detroit, I liked to save the victim's room for last."
229,00:13:36,00:13:38,"Hmm, I'm the opposite."
230,00:13:38,00:13:40,I like to work the toughest room first.
231,00:13:40,00:13:43,The first shot of the bedroom was an overall.
232,00:13:43,00:13:47,First shot with the crowbar was a perspective shot.
233,00:13:47,00:13:51,RHODES: Now Sanders is moving in for the close-ups.
234,00:13:51,00:13:54,"20 minutes later, he finishes photographing the bedroom."
235,00:13:54,00:13:57,Moving on to do the rest of the house.
236,00:13:57,00:14:00,Finishes photographing the rest of the house and returns to the bedroom.
237,00:14:00,00:14:03,What? He took over 50 photographs of the room.
238,00:14:03,00:14:04,Why go back?
239,00:14:04,00:14:06,Shouldn't he start collection?
240,00:14:06,00:14:09,Newer CSIs tend to take more photographs than they need.
241,00:14:09,00:14:14,"I was taught that film is cheap-- of course, that was back when we used film."
242,00:14:14,00:14:16,(chuckles)
243,00:14:18,00:14:20,Look at that.
244,00:14:23,00:14:26,"Crowbar's been moved, up and to the left."
245,00:14:27,00:14:35,"According to the Major Incident Log, Greg was alone in the crime scene until almost... 0730."
246,00:14:35,00:14:37,When did the reference blood arrive?
247,00:14:38,00:14:40,He signed for it at 0705.
248,00:14:40,00:14:49,"So Sanders was in the crime scene with the reference blood from Ellis and the crowbar, completely alone."
249,00:14:49,00:14:51,(thunder rumbling)
250,00:14:51,00:14:54,Margarit t'agavorakan.
251,00:14:54,00:14:57,Margarit t'agavorakan.
252,00:14:57,00:14:59,"Aren't you taking ""death imminent"" a little too far?"
253,00:14:59,00:15:02,Not the first time we've had a live one in here. Brass called.
254,00:15:02,00:15:05,Wanted to know if I could narrow down where the guy came from.
255,00:15:05,00:15:09,"Hospitals are running on generators, not doing any elective tests, so I brought him over."
256,00:15:09,00:15:10,What'd you find out?
257,00:15:10,00:15:13,"No surgeries, no birthmarks, scars or identifying features."
258,00:15:13,00:15:17,"His teeth are coated in fluoride, and he has a porcelain filling."
259,00:15:17,00:15:21,"So if he is from Armenia, he came to America when he was very young."
260,00:15:21,00:15:24,They don't do dental work like that over there.
261,00:15:24,00:15:26,Margarit t'agavorakan.
262,00:15:26,00:15:27,Sounds like chanting to me.
263,00:15:27,00:15:29,Word repetition.
264,00:15:29,00:15:35,"Reminds me of a case where a man fell into a frozen lake in Milwaukee, came out speaking Portuguese."
265,00:15:35,00:15:37,"David, fire up the fluoroscope, please."
266,00:15:37,00:15:39,Yeah. Margarit t'agavorakan.
267,00:15:41,00:15:43,Margarit t'agavorakan.
268,00:15:50,00:15:52,Bleeding at his temporal lobe.
269,00:15:52,00:15:56,Could be a case where head trauma causes a person to speak a foreign language.
270,00:15:56,00:16:00,It's a condition called TGA-- Transient Global Amnesia.
271,00:16:00,00:16:02,It only lasts about 24 hours.
272,00:16:02,00:16:06,"So, what he's saying is coming from his subconscious, something important to him."
273,00:16:06,00:16:10,Margarit t'agavorakan.
274,00:16:10,00:16:12,Mr. Sanders.
275,00:16:12,00:16:15,You took these photographs at the Claire Gibson crime scene.
276,00:16:15,00:16:17,34 minutes apart.
277,00:16:21,00:16:23,The crowbar's been moved.
278,00:16:24,00:16:26,Did you move it?
279,00:16:28,00:16:29,If...
280,00:16:29,00:16:34,"I saw that the crowbar had been moved, it would be in my notes."
281,00:16:34,00:16:36,It's not noted.
282,00:16:36,00:16:42,"During the time between these two photographs, you were the only person inside the crime scene."
283,00:16:42,00:16:45,"You know, I am so focused on my own work, I..."
284,00:16:45,00:16:49,barely notice what anybody else is doing at a scene.
285,00:16:49,00:16:57,"My former supervisor, Gil Grissom, trained me to follow a particular procedure so I didn't have to rely on my memory."
286,00:16:57,00:17:03,"Now, I was so afraid of making a mistake and being sent back to the lab that I followed that training exactly."
287,00:17:03,00:17:09,"FINLAY: And yet, this evidence was moved after it was documented and before it was collected."
288,00:17:09,00:17:12,RHODES: That's not protocol in any crime lab.
289,00:17:12,00:17:17,I would be more than happy to answer your specific questions if I could just review my notes.
290,00:17:17,00:17:19,That's all we need right now.
291,00:17:21,00:17:24,Should I be worried?
292,00:17:24,00:17:28,"Greg, a man served seven years for a crime he did not commit."
293,00:17:28,00:17:30,We all should be worried.
294,00:17:34,00:17:37,(thunder rumbling)
295,00:17:37,00:17:40,I just heard you're in the middle of a defense review.
296,00:17:40,00:17:42,Yeah. Kind of rough.
297,00:17:42,00:17:44,It's hell.
298,00:17:44,00:17:46,It's the worst part of the job.
299,00:17:46,00:17:51,"Only, I'm not being accused of making a mistake; I'm being accused of planting evidence."
300,00:17:52,00:17:53,Well...
301,00:17:53,00:17:56,"the evidence is gonna win out, Greg, I know it."
302,00:17:56,00:17:58,(phone ringing) Yeah.
303,00:17:58,00:18:01,"Oh, shoot, I got to go."
304,00:18:01,00:18:03,Brass found the bomber's hotel room.
305,00:18:03,00:18:05,"I'll call you later, okay?"
306,00:18:10,00:18:12,"(siren whoops, indistinct police radio chatter)"
307,00:18:12,00:18:15,"BRASS: So, the manager of the motel recognized our John Doe from the TV news."
308,00:18:15,00:18:17,Said he checked in yesterday.
309,00:18:17,00:18:22,"After she called the hotline, right, she checked his room, saw some guy tossing it."
310,00:18:22,00:18:24,She get a description?
311,00:18:24,00:18:26,"No, some guy-- white guy, blue shirt."
312,00:18:26,00:18:28,"You know, he saw her, he freaked out, he jumped off the balcony."
313,00:18:28,00:18:31,Here's the manager here; she has a heart condition.
314,00:18:31,00:18:32,She's on the oxygen and a cigarette.
315,00:18:32,00:18:34,Thanks for your help. I hope you feel better.
316,00:18:34,00:18:37,"Got to love Vegas, huh?"
317,00:18:43,00:18:45,SIDLE: Looks like our bomber's friends got here before we did.
318,00:18:45,00:18:47,Got scared off.
319,00:18:47,00:18:50,"Well, whatever they were after must have been important."
320,00:18:50,00:18:52,Something that would tell us who they are.
321,00:18:52,00:18:54,Or where their next target is.
322,00:19:00,00:19:02,His clothes are mostly in a pile by his suitcase.
323,00:19:02,00:19:04,I'm not sure he ever unpacked.
324,00:19:04,00:19:06,(indistinct police radio chatter)
325,00:19:10,00:19:13,Three pair of tightie-whities means three days of travel.
326,00:19:13,00:19:14,No suits.
327,00:19:14,00:19:16,All his clothes are casual.
328,00:19:16,00:19:18,Maybe a little too casual.
329,00:19:18,00:19:20,BRODY: I got two chargers.
330,00:19:23,00:19:25,No electronics.
331,00:19:25,00:19:27,No evidence the bomb was assembled here.
332,00:19:31,00:19:33,(thunder rumbling)
333,00:19:46,00:19:48,I got an American passport.
334,00:19:48,00:19:50,It's our bomber.
335,00:19:50,00:19:52,Name's Arman Agakian.
336,00:19:52,00:19:53,Armenian surname.
337,00:19:56,00:19:58,SIDLE: Huh.
338,00:20:00,00:20:03,I got a flash drive.
339,00:20:03,00:20:06,Guy hides a flash drive and a passport.
340,00:20:06,00:20:08,We might be looking at a pro.
341,00:20:19,00:20:20,"(beeps, buzzes)"
342,00:20:29,00:20:30,"Ah, Henry."
343,00:20:30,00:20:32,You're just in time for my demonstration.
344,00:20:32,00:20:35,"Wait, you seriously built a bomb?"
345,00:20:35,00:20:36,I'm going back to tox.
346,00:20:36,00:20:44,"I chemically tested the bomb frags, pieced together what I could, then used identical components to precisely duplicate Sara's bomb."
347,00:20:44,00:20:47,This is disturbing in so many ways.
348,00:20:47,00:20:52,"Why? It's just a magnetic switch, circuit board delay, military blasting cap, and a couple of pipes."
349,00:20:52,00:20:56,"'Kay, just to confirm, your bomb doesn't actually contain explosives?"
350,00:20:56,00:21:02,"No. It's identical to the original complex pipe bomb, except I substituted lightbulbs for explosives."
351,00:21:02,00:21:09,"Now, lifting this switch will duplicate the action that Sara took when she opened up the magnetized satchel flaps."
352,00:21:09,00:21:11,"If it's all wired correctly, then the lightbulb should go on."
353,00:21:11,00:21:14,"For the boom, you'll just have to use your imagination."
354,00:21:14,00:21:19,"Uh... if this does blow up, I will come back from the dead and haunt you."
355,00:21:19,00:21:21,This is perfectly safe.
356,00:21:23,00:21:24,(gasps)
357,00:21:24,00:21:26,"Well, that was fascinating."
358,00:21:26,00:21:29,I came by to give you DNA results.
359,00:21:29,00:21:30,"Uh, no DNA off the bomb parts."
360,00:21:30,00:21:33,Only John Doe's DNA on the straps of the satchel.
361,00:21:33,00:21:35,So it's back to the drawing board.
362,00:21:35,00:21:36,You want to help me?
363,00:21:36,00:21:38,"No, thanks."
364,00:21:38,00:21:40,I'm testing something for Finn.
365,00:21:41,00:21:43,(sighs)
366,00:21:47,00:21:54,"Ecklie wanted me to review the-the Gibson case as well, because the department and the D.A.'s office are named in the lawsuit."
367,00:21:54,00:21:55,Sit down for a second.
368,00:21:57,00:22:02,13 women reported seeing Ellis outside their homes over a two-month period.
369,00:22:02,00:22:06,He was caught on three separate security cameras.
370,00:22:06,00:22:08,"He had no criminal record, yet."
371,00:22:08,00:22:11,"Although, escalation's pretty common for voyeurs."
372,00:22:11,00:22:21,"At the trial, a coworker testified that Ellis threatened to get even with Claire Gibson because she had started the whole thing by calling the police."
373,00:22:21,00:22:25,So Ellis definitely had motive to kill Claire Gibson.
374,00:22:25,00:22:29,"I mean, if this happened today, Brass would be all over him like that."
375,00:22:29,00:22:36,"That all may be true, but we've just found uncontroverted evidence that the crowbar was moved at the scene."
376,00:22:36,00:22:39,Things get moved accidentally at crime scenes all the time.
377,00:22:39,00:22:42,Greg was the only person in the crime scene when it happened.
378,00:22:42,00:22:44,(sighs)
379,00:22:44,00:22:52,"All right, you know, leaving aside the fact that we know Greg, what possible reason would he have to frame Gus Ellis?"
380,00:22:52,00:22:54,It doesn't make any sense.
381,00:22:54,00:22:56,A new CSI trying to impress his boss.
382,00:22:56,00:22:58,"No, I'm not buying that."
383,00:22:58,00:23:07,"You know, I may be the newest CSI around here, but it's a pretty rotten job to have to comb through all of Greg's work."
384,00:23:09,00:23:14,"I didn't choose you because you're new, Jules, I chose you because you've been there."
385,00:23:14,00:23:16,You know how this has to go.
386,00:23:16,00:23:19,I hated you when you investigated me.
387,00:23:19,00:23:22,I don't want Greg to feel the same.
388,00:23:22,00:23:23,It's a search for the truth.
389,00:23:23,00:23:25,"He'll get over it, just like you did."
390,00:23:25,00:23:28,"Now, tell me about this crowbar."
391,00:23:28,00:23:31,Whose was it again?
392,00:23:31,00:23:37,"Joe Gibson, Claire's brother, came over to fix a broken gutter the morning of the murder."
393,00:23:37,00:23:39,"He left it outside, so it's his."
394,00:23:39,00:23:47,"D.A.'s theory was that Ellis used the crowbar to break into the house, broke a window, cut himself in the process."
395,00:23:47,00:23:52,There was only one small smear of blood found in the entire crime scene.
396,00:23:52,00:23:59,Ellis's attorney only has to show access and opportunity to implicate Greg.
397,00:23:59,00:24:00,I know.
398,00:24:00,00:24:04,Defense attorneys are gonna bring up this allegation every single time he testifies.
399,00:24:04,00:24:08,He is going to be a liability on every case he works.
400,00:24:08,00:24:11,His career will be over.
401,00:24:11,00:24:13,(phone chimes)
402,00:24:13,00:24:15,I got to go.
403,00:24:17,00:24:20,FINLAY: What'd you get?
404,00:24:20,00:24:22,Can I just say this?
405,00:24:22,00:24:26,"Greg is one of the most honest guys I know, and a great CSI."
406,00:24:26,00:24:28,He would never intentionally compromise a case.
407,00:24:34,00:24:41,Uh... one microliter per mil of EDTA was detected in the blood from the crowbar.
408,00:24:41,00:24:42,Blood preservative.
409,00:24:42,00:24:46,That would be consistent with blood collected in an EDTA tube.
410,00:24:46,00:24:47,"Thanks, Henry."
411,00:24:47,00:24:56,"But for your report, you should add that there are trace levels of EDTA in our blood from hundreds of everyday items-- soap, mayonnaise, salad dressing, beer, milk..."
412,00:24:56,00:24:57,I get it.
413,00:24:57,00:24:59,"...soda, ointments, detergents, breakfast..."
414,00:24:59,00:25:01,"Henry, I get it."
415,00:25:01,00:25:02,You know what? It's fine.
416,00:25:02,00:25:05,I'll just put it in my report.
417,00:25:06,00:25:08,"I will, too."
418,00:25:08,00:25:10,(thunder rumbling)
419,00:25:20,00:25:22,(sighs)
420,00:25:25,00:25:27,Sanders.
421,00:25:27,00:25:29,Right?
422,00:25:29,00:25:31,She looked at you like you were guilty of something.
423,00:25:31,00:25:34,"Excuse me? Terri Royce, the new chemist."
424,00:25:34,00:25:35,Oh.
425,00:25:35,00:25:37,What'd you do?
426,00:25:37,00:25:39,"Uh, nothing. I... it's..."
427,00:25:39,00:25:41,"Good heavens, spit it out."
428,00:25:41,00:25:44,I'm being sued for planting evidence.
429,00:25:44,00:25:46,(laughs) We've all been accused of that.
430,00:25:46,00:25:48,"You didn't do it, did you?"
431,00:25:48,00:25:50,No. Of course not.
432,00:25:50,00:25:53,Good. Come in here and help me with this Armenian bomber evidence.
433,00:25:56,00:26:03,GCMS identified polyunsaturated oil consistent with peanut oil from the suspect's pants in fragments of the satchel.
434,00:26:03,00:26:05,Take a look.
435,00:26:05,00:26:08,SANDERS: Looks like what ends up at the bottom of a deep fryer.
436,00:26:08,00:26:10,I worked at a fast-food joint in high school.
437,00:26:10,00:26:12,"Ha! Me, too."
438,00:26:12,00:26:13,I'm from New Orleans.
439,00:26:13,00:26:15,I didn't want to I.D. fried food on my first day.
440,00:26:15,00:26:17,What would y'all think?
441,00:26:17,00:26:24,"A couple of days ago, a barrel of frying oil intended for recycling got spilled outside the Mediterranean and caught fire."
442,00:26:24,00:26:26,Closed the loading dock for hours.
443,00:26:26,00:26:28,That would explain this.
444,00:26:34,00:26:36,SANDERS: Carbon ash?
445,00:26:36,00:26:38,From the fire.
446,00:26:38,00:26:41,Looks like the bomber was hanging at the loading dock of the Mediterranean.
447,00:26:41,00:26:43,Which has direct access to the flood channel.
448,00:26:43,00:26:46,I think you just found the bomber's target.
449,00:26:46,00:26:48,(laughs) All day long.
450,00:26:48,00:26:50,(sighs)
451,00:26:50,00:26:51,Thanks for saving me and coming out.
452,00:26:51,00:26:55,"Hey, any day I can be outside without my blast suit is a good day."
453,00:26:55,00:26:56,(chuckles)
454,00:26:56,00:26:59,I wanted to get a bomb expert's opinion on our guy's activities.
455,00:26:59,00:27:01,Glad I could help.
456,00:27:01,00:27:09,"So, Arman Agakian gets pulled out of this flood control channel about three miles downstream, holding a bomb."
457,00:27:11,00:27:13,We couldn't get past here.
458,00:27:28,00:27:30,This is how he got in.
459,00:27:30,00:27:32,"ANTHONY: Yeah, but where was he headed?"
460,00:27:37,00:27:43,SIDLE: Maybe he was trying to take a shortcut upstream to the other end of the Mediterranean.
461,00:27:43,00:27:47,"I mean, no terrorist would want to walk through the casino and be on a hundred cameras."
462,00:27:47,00:27:49,"It's way more stealth out here, but..."
463,00:27:49,00:27:51,he didn't make it.
464,00:27:51,00:27:54,"He slipped, fell in, and was swept downstream."
465,00:27:54,00:27:55,"Yeah, makes sense."
466,00:27:55,00:27:58,Trace evidence we found tells us that he was at this loading dock.
467,00:27:58,00:28:01,I was hoping you could help me narrow down a logical target.
468,00:28:01,00:28:02,Yeah. Let's go take a look.
469,00:28:02,00:28:04,Thanks.
470,00:28:04,00:28:06,(people chattering)
471,00:28:09,00:28:12,This is where that oil fire was.
472,00:28:12,00:28:16,"For a bomb that size, you'd need the perfect location."
473,00:28:16,00:28:19,"In Iraq, they'd put bombs in culverts under the road."
474,00:28:19,00:28:22,"You know, out of sight, maximum damage."
475,00:28:22,00:28:24,Kind of like a gas main under a casino.
476,00:28:28,00:28:30,Thanks.
477,00:28:35,00:28:37,A hell of a force multiplier.
478,00:28:37,00:28:40,Even a small charge would kill a lot of people.
479,00:28:40,00:28:43,SIDLE: There's a disturbance in the dirt under this meter.
480,00:28:43,00:28:45,Could be from a satchel.
481,00:28:46,00:28:48,And somebody left...
482,00:28:48,00:28:52,a little calling card on this sharp edge.
483,00:28:52,00:28:53,(thunder rumbling)
484,00:28:56,00:28:59,Perfect time for my new DNA instrument.
485,00:28:59,00:29:01,You have a mobile lab?
486,00:29:01,00:29:02,In the back of my car.
487,00:29:02,00:29:04,"No extractions, quick results."
488,00:29:04,00:29:05,You want to see it?
489,00:29:08,00:29:10,Wow.
490,00:29:18,00:29:19,(machine beeps)
491,00:29:21,00:29:22,(beeping)
492,00:29:24,00:29:25,(siren approaching)
493,00:29:25,00:29:27,Blood isn't Agakian's.
494,00:29:27,00:29:30,"So someone else placed the bomb, and Agakian removed it?"
495,00:29:30,00:29:31,(car door opens)
496,00:29:31,00:29:32,Sara?
497,00:29:32,00:29:34,Thought you'd want to know.
498,00:29:34,00:29:38,Agakian flatlined an hour ago at the hospital. What?
499,00:29:38,00:29:39,He did not have life-threatening injuries.
500,00:29:39,00:29:41,I just saw him with Doc Robbins.
501,00:29:41,00:29:42,David Phillips is picking him up.
502,00:29:42,00:29:44,(sighs)
503,00:29:44,00:29:45,Damn it!
504,00:29:51,00:29:52,"Uh, hi. Uh..."
505,00:29:52,00:29:54,Can I help you?
506,00:29:54,00:29:57,Yeah. I'm from the coroner's office.
507,00:29:57,00:30:00,I'm here to pick up a... Arman Agakian?
508,00:30:00,00:30:01,"No can do, pal."
509,00:30:01,00:30:02,I have my orders.
510,00:30:02,00:30:04,Federal orders trump yours.
511,00:30:04,00:30:07,He's FBI property now.
512,00:30:19,00:30:21,I went to Tovin's in Pahrump.
513,00:30:21,00:30:24,Best baklava in Nevada.
514,00:30:24,00:30:26,I brought you some pastry.
515,00:30:26,00:30:29,And I got Tovin to translate that mystery Armenian phrase.
516,00:30:29,00:30:33,"The guy is saying ""pearl royal."" Sounds like the name of a stripper."
517,00:30:33,00:30:35,"(laughs): Yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
518,00:30:35,00:30:37,How you holding up?
519,00:30:37,00:30:39,Just eager for this whole thing to be over with.
520,00:30:39,00:30:41,"It's crazy, right?"
521,00:30:41,00:30:48,"Everything we do every day is scrutinized, but it's different when it happens in front of you."
522,00:30:48,00:30:50,In your own lab.
523,00:30:50,00:30:52,I just wish that I could remember more details.
524,00:30:52,00:30:54,"Greg, you've worked hundreds of cases since then."
525,00:30:54,00:30:56,You can't expect to remember every detail.
526,00:30:56,00:31:00,"Yeah, but the details that they found don't look too good."
527,00:31:00,00:31:11,And if Finn and that expert can't exonerate me-- and I mean completely-- I'm through as a CSI.
528,00:31:13,00:31:17,EDTA in the blood from the crowbar is consistent with the hospital blood tube.
529,00:31:17,00:31:20,We need to nail down Sanders' timeline.
530,00:31:20,00:31:24,"Well, I tracked his movements through the crime scene based on the photo data code."
531,00:31:24,00:31:30,"0617 to 0637, Greg took 57 shots in the bedroom with the victim."
532,00:31:30,00:31:35,"Then he moved through the house, taking a total of 45 other shots encompassing 25 minutes."
533,00:31:35,00:31:44,"FINLAY: Exited the house to receive Ellis's reference blood at 0705, factoring in a couple of minutes to sign and initial the paperwork."
534,00:31:44,00:31:46,He then returned to the house.
535,00:31:46,00:31:50,"RHODES: Four minutes later, he took the photo showing the moved crowbar."
536,00:31:50,00:31:57,"If Sanders made a conscious decision to frame Ellis, four minutes is enough time to do it."
537,00:31:57,00:31:59,"All right, let's see."
538,00:31:59,00:32:10,"He'd have to carefully break the seal, open the tube, smear the blood on the crowbar, put the cap back on, reseal the package and take the photo."
539,00:32:10,00:32:13,All with no guarantee that he wouldn't be seen.
540,00:32:13,00:32:16,It's possible.
541,00:32:16,00:32:19,Who received Ellis's reference blood at the lab?
542,00:32:19,00:32:23,Did they note any discrepancies in the seal?
543,00:32:23,00:32:28,"FINLAY: Uh, Wendy Simms, the DNA analyst at the time, received the blood sealed and initialed."
544,00:32:28,00:32:30,It's in her notes.
545,00:32:30,00:32:38,"RHODES: And then Sanders took the final four shots in the bedroom, and then no more, until the exterior shots after the scene was broken down."
546,00:32:38,00:32:42,"To document the condition of the crime scene after the police had left, which is protocol."
547,00:32:43,00:32:45,Wait a second. You see that?
548,00:32:47,00:32:51,There's blood on the sidewalk outside the scene.
549,00:32:54,00:32:58,There was no blood outside the perimeter in any of Greg's initial shots.
550,00:32:58,00:33:02,That means someone bled outside the scene after the perimeter was set.
551,00:33:02,00:33:04,Gravitational drops.
552,00:33:04,00:33:06,Where did that blood come from?
553,00:33:06,00:33:12,Simms also tested a handkerchief that was in Ellis's pocket when he was booked.
554,00:33:12,00:33:14,Blood on both was Ellis's.
555,00:33:14,00:33:17,How did the blood get on the handkerchief?
556,00:33:17,00:33:21,Doctor at the hospital noted that Ellis had no injuries.
557,00:33:21,00:33:24,"Added what looks like ""Noble"" in all caps."
558,00:33:26,00:33:29,Does Ellis look like a handkerchief kind of guy to you?
559,00:33:34,00:33:36,FINLAY: Amido black reacts with the blood.
560,00:33:36,00:33:38,RHODES: Look at ridge detail.
561,00:33:38,00:33:42,It's surprising Simms didn't process the fingerprint in the first place.
562,00:33:42,00:33:43,"Well, there was no context for it."
563,00:33:43,00:33:47,The only useful evidence would have been to find Claire Gibson's blood on the handkerchief.
564,00:33:47,00:33:53,"Otherwise, it's just Ellis's blood on Ellis's handkerchief in Ellis's pants, so..."
565,00:33:53,00:33:55,wouldn't have been a big deal.
566,00:33:55,00:33:57,(beeping)
567,00:34:00,00:34:02,"""Yancey Langer."
568,00:34:02,00:34:05,"Restricted access."" State employee?"
569,00:34:05,00:34:08,His name is on the Major Incident Log.
570,00:34:11,00:34:14,Does this look familiar to you?
571,00:34:14,00:34:18,Looks like the handkerchiefs my mom always buys me for Christmas.
572,00:34:18,00:34:19,Why?
573,00:34:19,00:34:23,"Do you remember Claire Gibson's murder from March 21, 2006?"
574,00:34:23,00:34:24,Sure.
575,00:34:24,00:34:26,I remember everything. It was my first murder scene.
576,00:34:26,00:34:28,I was a Police Explorer back then.
577,00:34:28,00:34:31,Your handkerchief was found inside Gus Ellis's pocket.
578,00:34:31,00:34:34,He was the suspect at the time. Can you explain that?
579,00:34:34,00:34:39,Yeah. I was waiting on a radio car to take him to the hospital to get a blood sample or something.
580,00:34:39,00:34:42,"Guy was sitting on the curb, scared, got a nosebleed."
581,00:34:42,00:34:45,He was dripping blood everywhere.
582,00:34:45,00:34:49,"I tried to stop it, then gave him my handkerchief."
583,00:34:49,00:34:51,Nosebleed. N-O-B-L.
584,00:34:51,00:34:54,That was the abbreviation on the doctor's notes.
585,00:34:54,00:35:00,"RHODES: According to the Major Incident Log, you stayed outside the perimeter of the crime scene the whole time."
586,00:35:00,00:35:03,"That's not true, is it?"
587,00:35:03,00:35:07,"When the officers left with the suspect, I snuck into the scene."
588,00:35:07,00:35:10,I never saw a dead body before.
589,00:35:10,00:35:14,Did you touch anything while you were in there? No.
590,00:35:14,00:35:15,Are you sure?
591,00:35:17,00:35:19,I tripped.
592,00:35:25,00:35:29,"Kicked a crowbar on the floor, but I put it right back where it was."
593,00:35:29,00:35:35,Do you realize that you transferred Ellis's blood from your hand to that crowbar?
594,00:35:39,00:35:43,That blood was the physical evidence that convicted him.
595,00:35:43,00:35:53,RHODES: Gus Ellis spent seven years in prison because you went into a crime scene unauthorized to see a body and contaminated the evidence.
596,00:35:55,00:35:57,I never followed up on the case.
597,00:35:57,00:36:01,Didn't even know the guy was convicted.
598,00:36:01,00:36:04,I'm so sorry.
599,00:36:04,00:36:06,I...
600,00:36:06,00:36:08,I didn't know.
601,00:36:10,00:36:12,I'm gonna make some calls.
602,00:36:18,00:36:22,"ANDREWS: Is it safe in here, Crazy Harry?"
603,00:36:22,00:36:24,Still can't figure out how the bomb was activated.
604,00:36:24,00:36:30,I'm stumped. I've double-checked all the connections from the magnetic switch to the circuit boards to the blasting caps to the pipes.
605,00:36:30,00:36:32,Still doesn't work.
606,00:36:32,00:36:34,Then the circuit isn't the problem.
607,00:36:34,00:36:35,Let me see.
608,00:36:35,00:36:38,Blasting caps creep me out.
609,00:36:38,00:36:43,I remember a public service film in grammar school taught kids not to play with them.
610,00:36:43,00:36:44,Showed a kid who bit down on one.
611,00:36:44,00:36:46,Ugh! Yeah.
612,00:36:46,00:36:49,Made a big impression on him. And me.
613,00:36:49,00:36:50,Just... (imitates explosion)
614,00:36:54,00:36:57,That blasting cap completely fragmented.
615,00:36:57,00:36:58,Why is this one still intact?
616,00:36:58,00:37:00,There's white powder still inside.
617,00:37:00,00:37:02,"I mean, shouldn't the explosive be brown?"
618,00:37:02,00:37:05,RDX and PETN are both white.
619,00:37:05,00:37:08,But this should have been completely consumed in the controlled blast.
620,00:37:08,00:37:11,"Yeah, we should test it."
621,00:37:12,00:37:15,"By ""we,"" you mean me?"
622,00:37:15,00:37:18,Primary explosives are friction-sensitive and flammable; it's more up your alley.
623,00:37:18,00:37:21,I'm a body fluid guy. Not touching that.
624,00:37:31,00:37:34,Powder should burn when exposed to flame.
625,00:37:44,00:37:46,"ANDREWS: Well, there's the problem."
626,00:37:46,00:37:48,That white stuff isn't explosive.
627,00:37:48,00:37:50,That bomb was never intended to go off.
628,00:37:55,00:37:57,How's it going?
629,00:37:57,00:37:59,"God, I have tried everything I can think of."
630,00:37:59,00:38:05,"Anything that we found in the hotel room, anything that he was hiding, anything we know about Agakian-- none of it's working."
631,00:38:05,00:38:08,I just... I can't figure out the pass code to this flash drive.
632,00:38:08,00:38:11,Have you tried the info from that bogus AFIS hit?
633,00:38:11,00:38:13,Everything I can think of.
634,00:38:13,00:38:16,What about... the fake address?
635,00:38:17,00:38:19,What was it again?
636,00:38:19,00:38:22,473 Snowdrift Lane.
637,00:38:24,00:38:26,(computer trilling)
638,00:38:30,00:38:32,Look at the intersection that's highlighted.
639,00:38:35,00:38:37,We cracked the password on that flash drive.
640,00:38:37,00:38:41,But it looks like I'm a little late.
641,00:38:41,00:38:46,"CSI Sidle. Sara, this is Ben Parker, special agent, FBI."
642,00:38:46,00:38:47,We'll need to take that flash drive.
643,00:38:54,00:38:56,Cut your arm on a gas meter cage?
644,00:38:59,00:39:01,You're here about Arman Agakian.
645,00:39:01,00:39:03,"Although, I'm sure that's not his real name."
646,00:39:03,00:39:06,"He's probably not dead, either."
647,00:39:06,00:39:07,"Agakian's FBI, Sara."
648,00:39:07,00:39:13,He's been working undercover for the last couple years to infiltrate the Armenian mob.
649,00:39:13,00:39:15,They've been extorting money from The Mediterranean.
650,00:39:15,00:39:17,He posed as an explosives specialist.
651,00:39:17,00:39:18,Last night was his big drop.
652,00:39:18,00:39:25,You gave him two dud bombs that seemed very real to plant at The Mediterranean.
653,00:39:25,00:39:28,(thunder rumbling)
654,00:39:30,00:39:33,He planted the first one.
655,00:39:33,00:39:34,When he went to plant the second one...
656,00:39:38,00:39:41,...he slipped into the flood channel and got washed away.
657,00:39:47,00:39:49,"After that, we had to abort the op."
658,00:39:49,00:39:51,We picked up the bomb at the loading dock.
659,00:39:51,00:39:53,Scratching your agent's arm in the process.
660,00:39:53,00:39:56,How does planting dud bombs help your undercover op?
661,00:39:56,00:40:02,"We planned to discover the bombs very publicly first, then release to the media that they were very dangerous and expertly made."
662,00:40:02,00:40:07,Fooling the Armenians and establishing your agent as an explosives expert.
663,00:40:07,00:40:11,What about the intersection of Pearl Street and Royal Avenue in North Vegas?
664,00:40:11,00:40:13,What was that about?
665,00:40:13,00:40:16,That's where our undercover met his Armenian contact.
666,00:40:16,00:40:18,Probably why Pearl-Royal stuck in his mind.
667,00:40:18,00:40:21,And the extortion plot-- has that been aborted as well?
668,00:40:21,00:40:24,Our undercover was able to identify the individuals responsible.
669,00:40:24,00:40:25,We're arresting them right now.
670,00:40:25,00:40:27,Good.
671,00:40:27,00:40:30,Parker's men are gonna need to take custody of all the evidence.
672,00:40:30,00:40:32,Of course.
673,00:40:32,00:40:35,"If we're square here, I need to speak to Captain Jim Brass."
674,00:40:35,00:40:37,Sounds like a good idea.
675,00:40:40,00:40:47,"WOMAN: Federal agents descended on the Mediterranean Casino today, taking five Armenian nationals into custody."
676,00:40:47,00:40:53,The individuals arrested are suspected to be members of an Armenian organized crime ring.
677,00:40:53,00:40:57,Our lawyers scheduled a deposition with Langer for next week.
678,00:40:57,00:41:00,"Unsure how it's gonna turn out, but Sanders is off the hook."
679,00:41:00,00:41:02,I'm glad.
680,00:41:02,00:41:07,"Well, no offense, but I hope the next time I see you will be at an American Academy meeting."
681,00:41:07,00:41:09,(laughs)
682,00:41:11,00:41:12,See you later.
683,00:41:12,00:41:15,Thank you.
684,00:41:16,00:41:18,Hey. Hey.
685,00:41:18,00:41:19,Talked to Greg.
686,00:41:19,00:41:20,How's he doing?
687,00:41:20,00:41:27,"Look, I guess I get why you thought you had to treat him the way that you did, but it's tough to be on the receiving end of that."
688,00:41:27,00:41:29,"Yeah, I know."
689,00:41:29,00:41:34,"I had an I.A. investigation in Seattle, and Russell treated me the exact same way."
690,00:41:35,00:41:37,Still not over it.
691,00:41:39,00:41:41,Greg's in the locker room.
692,00:41:51,00:41:53,Hey. Congratulations.
693,00:41:53,00:41:56,Thanks.
694,00:41:56,00:41:58,I know I was really hard on you.
695,00:41:58,00:42:04,"I was trying to do my best for someone that I really do care about, but I couldn't act like it."
696,00:42:04,00:42:08,"I had to seem impartial, or it really would have hurt your case."
697,00:42:08,00:42:10,"Hey, I understand."
698,00:42:12,00:42:15,"Greg, I never thought you did anything wrong."
699,00:42:18,00:42:20,How about that grilled cheese at RJ's?
700,00:42:20,00:42:23,That sounds great.
701,00:42:23,00:42:24,My treat?
702,00:42:24,00:42:26,Okay.
