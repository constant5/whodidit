0,00:00:03,00:00:06,Come on!
1,00:00:39,00:00:41,So nice to see Black Sabbath again.
2,00:00:41,00:00:44,Saw them in '78 at the Spectrum in Philly.
3,00:00:46,00:00:50,Around the same time I saw the Dead at the Winterland Ballroom.
4,00:00:50,00:00:52,Little bit of a different vibe.
5,00:01:08,00:01:11,You sure this is where we're supposed to meet the guy?
6,00:01:11,00:01:13,"Backstage, man, after the show."
7,00:01:13,00:01:15,I still think it's a bad idea.
8,00:01:15,00:01:18,"Look, this reporter's just gonna follow you around for a few days."
9,00:01:18,00:01:19,He gets his story. We all go home.
10,00:01:19,00:01:20,"Mayor's happy, all right?"
11,00:01:20,00:01:22,A little positive PR wouldn't hurt.
12,00:01:22,00:01:23,What?
13,00:01:23,00:01:25,I said a little... (chuckles)
14,00:01:44,00:01:46,Come on!
15,00:01:46,00:01:49,(cheering)
16,00:01:51,00:01:52,(song ends)
17,00:01:58,00:02:01,"So, Ozzy, another incredible gig."
18,00:02:01,00:02:03,"The new album is entitled 13, am I right?"
19,00:02:03,00:02:05,That's-that's correct.
20,00:02:05,00:02:09,"The album's kind of like a... a modern sound, but there's no denying it's a Black Sabbath album."
21,00:02:09,00:02:11,"Still got the Black Sabbath vibe, you know?"
22,00:02:11,00:02:13,"Listen, I think we got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Nice one."
23,00:02:13,00:02:18,"I'm sure you don't remember this, but you were actually my first interview ever. I was?"
24,00:02:18,00:02:19,"The Ultimate Sin Tour, 1986."
25,00:02:19,00:02:22,Really? I-I don't remember.
26,00:02:22,00:02:23,The concert or me?
27,00:02:23,00:02:25,I don't remember 1986. (chuckles)
28,00:02:25,00:02:26,Really great to meet you.
29,00:02:26,00:02:28,Thanks for you time again. You're very welcome.
30,00:02:28,00:02:29,"Best of luck with of the tour. All right, thank you."
31,00:02:29,00:02:32,"Sheriff Ecklie, good to see you."
32,00:02:32,00:02:33,"John Merchiston, Savoir magazine."
33,00:02:33,00:02:35,"D.B. Russell, CSI."
34,00:02:35,00:02:36,It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
35,00:02:36,00:02:41,I was reading up about your exploits in Seattle catching the Gig Harbor Killer. Real thriller.
36,00:02:41,00:02:45,"I'm not sure that three days with us will, uh, reach that same level of thrills."
37,00:02:45,00:02:48,I sense a certain reluctance on your part.
38,00:02:48,00:02:50,"I just don't see the value, to be honest, you know."
39,00:02:50,00:02:53,"Another story about cops. Hardly cops, are you?"
40,00:02:53,00:02:55,"I mean, you're the, uh, nation's number one crime lab."
41,00:02:55,00:02:58,Sworn to uphold the law in the land of the lawless.
42,00:02:58,00:02:59,"I-I've got a working title, actually. (cell phone ringing)"
43,00:02:59,00:03:05,"It's, uh, ""Police as Paradox in Sin City."" There's your positive PR for you. Yes."
44,00:03:05,00:03:06,"Um, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go."
45,00:03:06,00:03:07,I got a 419.
46,00:03:07,00:03:09,Dead body.
47,00:03:09,00:03:11,Sounds like we're off to a good start.
48,00:03:11,00:03:13,"Okay, all right. Go get your stuff."
49,00:03:13,00:03:16,You just signed yourself up for the grave shift.
50,00:03:17,00:03:19,RUSSELL: What the hell is this place?
51,00:03:19,00:03:21,These are porn stages.
52,00:03:21,00:03:22,Used by a local production company.
53,00:03:22,00:03:24,They're currently out of town.
54,00:03:24,00:03:26,I assume you've met...
55,00:03:26,00:03:29,"Yes. Mr. Merchiston and I went over the ground rules, right?"
56,00:03:29,00:03:31,I brought my own latex.
57,00:03:31,00:03:32,"Yeah, now you don't touch anything. Clear?"
58,00:03:32,00:03:36,"You know, I did a piece on Scotland Yard, so I had to pass their forensic field training."
59,00:03:36,00:03:37,"Impressive, Sherlock."
60,00:03:37,00:03:40,Keep your hands in your pocket.
61,00:03:40,00:03:42,Welcome to the Love Motel.
62,00:03:44,00:03:46,"New partner, Jim?"
63,00:03:46,00:03:49,"Oh, uh, John Merchiston, this is, uh, CSI Julie Finlay."
64,00:03:49,00:03:53,"RUSSELL: Mr. Merchiston's a reporter, and he's embedded with us for a few days."
65,00:03:53,00:03:54,"All right, fill me in."
66,00:03:54,00:03:56,Jane Doe. Mummified body.
67,00:03:56,00:03:59,"So, she's been here at least a couple of months."
68,00:03:59,00:04:03,"You'd think so, but according to the owner of this fine establishment, not so."
69,00:04:03,00:04:04,What do you mean?
70,00:04:04,00:04:08,Production on Lambskin Linings Playbook ended Monday.
71,00:04:08,00:04:11,"The company, uh, picked up, went to an adult convention in Miami."
72,00:04:11,00:04:13,The place has been locked up for 48 hours.
73,00:04:13,00:04:15,At least until it was broken into this morning.
74,00:04:15,00:04:17,FINLAY: Skin under the neck is opened up.
75,00:04:17,00:04:18,You can see the hyoid bone.
76,00:04:18,00:04:21,It's broken. So she was strangled.
77,00:04:21,00:04:23,What is that? (sniffs)
78,00:04:23,00:04:26,"That sweet, flowery smell-- what is that?"
79,00:04:26,00:04:28,"Well, obviously, you guys don't hang out in strip clubs."
80,00:04:28,00:04:32,"Yeah, I-I thing it's called ""Honeysuckle,"" um..."
81,00:04:32,00:04:33,"""Honeysuckle"" something. What's it called?"
82,00:04:33,00:04:37,"Honeysuckle... ""Summer."" ""Honeysuckle Summer."" That's it."
83,00:04:37,00:04:38,Personal experience?
84,00:04:38,00:04:40,I never reveal a source.
85,00:04:40,00:04:44,"It's odd, though, isn't it, that there's this new stripper smell on an old stripper body?"
86,00:04:44,00:04:45,That's not all that's new.
87,00:04:45,00:04:48,Lingerie still has the price tag on it.
88,00:04:48,00:04:52,"Okay, all right, so maybe she was a stripper, maybe she wasn't."
89,00:04:52,00:04:59,"Either way, killer strangles her, mummifies the body, breaks in, stages her to look like a porn star."
90,00:04:59,00:05:02,"Yeah, trying to give us all a show."
91,00:05:36,00:05:38,"So, all this work, what do you think the message is?"
92,00:05:38,00:05:41,Could be a twisted vendetta against the porn company.
93,00:05:41,00:05:46,Brass is running down all the employees past and present.
94,00:05:46,00:05:49,"Attention to detail, all the way down to the Bible on the nightstand."
95,00:05:49,00:05:52,Could be our killer's obsessed with sin.
96,00:05:52,00:05:53,(chuckles)
97,00:06:01,00:06:04,What is that?
98,00:06:04,00:06:06,I don't know.
99,00:06:06,00:06:09,Bunch of zeroes carved on it.
100,00:06:09,00:06:11,It opens.
101,00:06:12,00:06:14,(gasps)
102,00:06:14,00:06:17,That is a black widow.
103,00:06:17,00:06:22,"That's the Steatoda grossa. That's the ""false black widow."" Harmless. Says you."
104,00:06:22,00:06:25,Beware of killers bearing gifts.
105,00:06:28,00:06:34,"If we can restore her prints or extract DNA, maybe we can get an I.D."
106,00:06:34,00:06:36,"Of course, there's no guarantee she'll be in the system."
107,00:06:36,00:06:39,Could be we'd have more luck if we restore her face.
108,00:06:39,00:06:42,"Oh, it's a little late for that, Doc."
109,00:06:42,00:06:43,Not necessarily.
110,00:06:43,00:06:45,You're thinking Dr. Stevens.
111,00:06:45,00:06:47,Who's Dr. Stevens?
112,00:06:47,00:06:52,He's developed rehydrating techniques to identify bodies found in desert environments.
113,00:06:52,00:06:58,"The process, it not only restores the skin, but it restores the vital organs, everything."
114,00:06:58,00:07:01,We can do a full autopsy.
115,00:07:01,00:07:02,There's just one problem.
116,00:07:02,00:07:04,And what's that?
117,00:07:04,00:07:07,There's always a risk the process could destroy additional evidence.
118,00:07:07,00:07:09,"Well, right now, getting an I.D."
119,00:07:09,00:07:11,is our best shot at catching this killer.
120,00:07:11,00:07:14,I agree. I'll run the bath.
121,00:07:45,00:07:48,ECKLIE: Doc really pulled off a miracle.
122,00:07:48,00:07:49,He gave us a face?
123,00:07:49,00:07:51,"Yeah, but we still don't have any I.D."
124,00:07:51,00:07:53,Facial recognition in Missing Persons came up empty.
125,00:07:53,00:07:55,What about her DNA?
126,00:07:55,00:07:58,Same story. Nothing in CODIS.
127,00:07:58,00:08:01,"Well, maybe if we go public with her photo, someone will recognize her. It's worth a shot."
128,00:08:01,00:08:04,"Hey, M. Hey. Look what Doc found during autopsy..."
129,00:08:04,00:08:06,inside her chest cavity.
130,00:08:06,00:08:10,Killer inserted it inside her mummified heart.
131,00:08:10,00:08:12,ECKLIE: Gold charm?
132,00:08:12,00:08:14,Hooker with a heart of gold.
133,00:08:14,00:08:15,Someone's got a sick sense of humor.
134,00:08:15,00:08:17,Get it to Hodges. Thank you.
135,00:08:17,00:08:18,Shall do.
136,00:08:18,00:08:21,"Bye, Dad. All right, see you."
137,00:08:21,00:08:24,"Oh, how goes it with Mr. Savoir Magazine?"
138,00:08:24,00:08:29,"He's a bit of an ass, but the longer he's with us, the more of that positive PR you'll get."
139,00:08:30,00:08:32,"What's your expert opinion on this, uh..."
140,00:08:32,00:08:37,on this little trinket that the killer left behind?
141,00:08:37,00:08:38,"I don't know, man."
142,00:08:38,00:08:40,"The, uh, numbers could mean something."
143,00:08:40,00:08:42,"They could be symbols, couldn't they?"
144,00:08:42,00:08:44,I just got back from Luxor.
145,00:08:45,00:08:47,The one in Egypt.
146,00:08:47,00:08:51,"I was doing an article on the tourist trade there, or the lack thereof."
147,00:08:51,00:08:53,I don't know. Hieroglyphics are just in my mind right now.
148,00:08:53,00:08:55,"Hieroglyphics, symbols, you know."
149,00:08:55,00:08:56,Right.
150,00:08:56,00:08:59,Do you mind if I touch this one?
151,00:08:59,00:09:00,"(chuckling): No, go ahead. Thanks."
152,00:09:02,00:09:06,"The spider's definitely a dramatic touch, wouldn't you say?"
153,00:09:06,00:09:08,That's the pill bug you're smelling.
154,00:09:08,00:09:11,It emits a chemical to deter predators.
155,00:09:11,00:09:16,"It's impressive, your, uh... your knowledge of entomology."
156,00:09:16,00:09:18,I had a good teacher.
157,00:09:20,00:09:25,"Going public with the photo of our victim really paid off. You remember ""Miss Kitty""?"
158,00:09:25,00:09:26,RUSSELL: She recognize the victim?
159,00:09:26,00:09:29,"She only wants to talk to you, so..."
160,00:09:29,00:09:30,Hey.
161,00:09:30,00:09:32,"Miss Kitty, nice to see you again."
162,00:09:32,00:09:34,"You, too."
163,00:09:34,00:09:36,"Oh, and it's not ""Miss Kitty"" anymore."
164,00:09:36,00:09:39,I don't use my street name. I use my real name now.
165,00:09:39,00:09:40,Angela Banner.
166,00:09:40,00:09:41,"Said you're out of the game now, right?"
167,00:09:41,00:09:43,"Yes, and that's why I know Megan."
168,00:09:43,00:09:44,She's the girl that was killed?
169,00:09:44,00:09:45,Megan Ramirez. She was a stripper.
170,00:09:45,00:09:47,Did porn on the side.
171,00:09:47,00:09:52,"Like me, she wanted out. And I was helping her through the Fellowship of Fallen Angels."
172,00:09:52,00:09:53,"Oh, the stripper church downtown?"
173,00:09:53,00:09:55,Brother Larson's ministry.
174,00:09:55,00:09:56,Brother Larson.
175,00:09:56,00:09:58,We're working to save girls like Megan.
176,00:09:58,00:10:00,"Now, when was the last time you saw her?"
177,00:10:00,00:10:03,Two months ago at a support meeting. And then she just...
178,00:10:03,00:10:05,disappeared.
179,00:10:05,00:10:06,But that's not all.
180,00:10:06,00:10:09,"Since then, all of these girls have disappeared."
181,00:10:09,00:10:15,"They haven't come to counseling, to meetings, to fellowship suppers. And you know they got to eat."
182,00:10:15,00:10:20,"In spite of your valiant efforts to save these girls, some of them may not want to be saved."
183,00:10:20,00:10:23,"If they had any doubt, they would've come to me or Brother Larson."
184,00:10:23,00:10:24,They wouldn't just up and leave.
185,00:10:24,00:10:27,Y'all have to do something so that these girls don't end up like Megan.
186,00:10:27,00:10:28,Excuse me.
187,00:10:32,00:10:34,"Look, Nancy, that's all I know right now."
188,00:10:34,00:10:37,"No, I mean, it's... I don't have any more information."
189,00:10:37,00:10:39,"No, you don't have to do that."
190,00:10:39,00:10:40,All right.
191,00:10:42,00:10:46,"I got to run. Okay, bye-bye. Bye."
192,00:10:46,00:10:50,Your daughter Ellie is one of the girls who may be missing. I'm so sorry.
193,00:10:50,00:10:53,"Well, you know, I had to call my ex-wife Nancy, tell her that, you know, Ellie's in Vegas."
194,00:10:53,00:10:56,Left out the real trouble that she might be in.
195,00:10:56,00:10:57,Nancy's flying out?
196,00:10:57,00:10:59,"Yeah, tonight."
197,00:10:59,00:11:02,"You know, ever since Ellie's been in Vegas, I've been trying to track her down."
198,00:11:02,00:11:04,"Just to reach out, connect, you know?"
199,00:11:04,00:11:08,"When I saw that picture, I mean, it was like a stab in my heart."
200,00:11:08,00:11:12,"Okay, look, you said yourself, we don't know for sure that something's happened to these girls."
201,00:11:12,00:11:14,But we know what happened to one of them.
202,00:11:14,00:11:16,"All right, look, we-we have this information."
203,00:11:16,00:11:18,We'll get it out to everybody.
204,00:11:18,00:11:23,"Now, if Angela's right and these girls are in danger, we'll find them."
205,00:11:23,00:11:28,WOMAN: I called as soon as the hospital received a missing persons photo from your office.
206,00:11:28,00:11:30,"So, you say her name is Teresa Hill?"
207,00:11:30,00:11:31,Mm-hmm.
208,00:11:31,00:11:32,It's nice to finally have her name.
209,00:11:32,00:11:34,"Oh, so she came in as a Jane Doe?"
210,00:11:34,00:11:36,Two weeks ago. Been here ever since.
211,00:11:36,00:11:41,"She was found in the alley behind the motel, strangled and left for dead."
212,00:11:41,00:11:45,"Well, I'm sure she's been processed, but I'm gonna need to examine her on my own."
213,00:11:45,00:11:46,I understand; do what you need to do.
214,00:11:46,00:11:47,"Okay, thanks. Mm-hmm."
215,00:11:51,00:11:53,(monitor beeping)
216,00:11:55,00:11:57,Hey. Hey.
217,00:11:58,00:12:00,That from the evidence locker?
218,00:12:00,00:12:02,Personal items.
219,00:12:02,00:12:04,Day shift collected them when they were processing her.
220,00:12:04,00:12:09,"According to Angela, Teresa advertised online."
221,00:12:09,00:12:14,"Her angle was that she claimed to be a virgin, auctioning off her virtue."
222,00:12:14,00:12:16,(shutter clicks)
223,00:12:16,00:12:18,Typical hooker stuff.
224,00:12:18,00:12:20,"Condoms, lipstick..."
225,00:12:23,00:12:25,(gasps)
226,00:12:25,00:12:27,What is it?
227,00:12:27,00:12:28,Charm bracelet...
228,00:12:28,00:12:33,"with a gold heart pendant, just like the one Doc took out of Megan Ramirez."
229,00:12:34,00:12:37,"There are no coincidences, right?"
230,00:12:37,00:12:39,(phone chirps)
231,00:12:41,00:12:45,"It's Nick; he's following up on one of our missing girls, Chloe Rudolph."
232,00:12:45,00:12:47,They find her? Yeah.
233,00:12:47,00:12:50,"Like you said, no coincidences."
234,00:12:58,00:13:01,"SANDERS: Whoa, you sure weren't kidding."
235,00:13:01,00:13:05,"How long do you think she's been like this? About 12 hours, I guess."
236,00:13:05,00:13:07,She seems to be in full rigor.
237,00:13:07,00:13:13,"You know, Angela Banner's file said that Chloe Rudolph here worked for a food fetish porn site."
238,00:13:13,00:13:16,People paid to watch her eat.
239,00:13:16,00:13:19,"The, uh, camera went live about an hour ago."
240,00:13:19,00:13:23,"That's when the calls started coming in, and the ISP traced it back to this address."
241,00:13:23,00:13:25,This her place?
242,00:13:25,00:13:26,"No, it's her boyfriend's."
243,00:13:26,00:13:30,"And where is he? He's in the freezer, chilling with the ice cream."
244,00:13:43,00:13:47,"(freezer closes) Well, boyfriend's C.O.D. is obvious."
245,00:13:47,00:13:49,What about hers?
246,00:13:49,00:13:57,"Well, petechial hemorrhaging suggests that she choked on dessert, but that's not your typical chocolate."
247,00:13:57,00:13:59,Schistocerca gregaria.
248,00:14:00,00:14:02,Chocolate-covered locust.
249,00:14:02,00:14:05,Just when you thought it couldn't get any sicker.
250,00:14:15,00:14:17,Wonder if there's a spider inside.
251,00:14:19,00:14:21,Not this time.
252,00:14:22,00:14:25,"Well, that's three bodies now, Greg."
253,00:14:25,00:14:27,And another one clinging to life in the hospital.
254,00:14:27,00:14:30,We got ourselves a serial.
255,00:14:34,00:14:37,I don't think we're looking at death by chocolate.
256,00:14:37,00:14:38,Hyoid bone's broken.
257,00:14:38,00:14:40,She was strangled.
258,00:14:40,00:14:43,M.O.'s with the female victims is consistent.
259,00:14:43,00:14:46,HODGES: As are other elements of the killer's signature.
260,00:14:46,00:14:50,I did notice this odd pattern of abrasions on her back.
261,00:14:53,00:14:55,(device whirring)
262,00:14:55,00:14:58,That's disturbing.
263,00:14:58,00:15:03,"""Thou shalt not bear false witness."" That's from the Ten Commandments, right?"
264,00:15:03,00:15:05,"Number nine, I think."
265,00:15:05,00:15:06,The lettering is so defined.
266,00:15:06,00:15:08,(beeps)
267,00:15:08,00:15:18,"To do something like this, you'd have to create the bruises under the skin right around the time of death, knowing that they'd only be visible during autopsy."
268,00:15:18,00:15:19,He wanted us to see this.
269,00:15:19,00:15:22,"Here, now."
270,00:15:22,00:15:23,Talk about a signature.
271,00:15:23,00:15:27,"RUSSELL: Religious references, Bibles, wooden..."
272,00:15:27,00:15:30,"whatever the hell these are, bugs, gold hearts..."
273,00:15:30,00:15:32,"Yeah, usually a killer has one signature."
274,00:15:32,00:15:34,This guy is all over the page.
275,00:15:34,00:15:36,"He doesn't seem to have a specific type, either."
276,00:15:36,00:15:37,"I mean, he's even killed a guy now, right?"
277,00:15:37,00:15:39,A pimp.
278,00:15:39,00:15:46,"All right, so based on what Angela told us, the seven girls who seem to have gone missing all disappeared around the same time."
279,00:15:46,00:15:48,Eight weeks ago.
280,00:15:48,00:15:51,Now the guy's dropping bodies on his own time table.
281,00:15:51,00:15:55,"FINLAY: Two weeks ago, Teresa Hill is found strangled, survives."
282,00:15:55,00:15:59,"Last night, Megan Ramirez is found dead on a porn stage."
283,00:15:59,00:16:03,"RUSSELL: This afternoon, Chloe Rudolph dead with her pimp in the kitchen."
284,00:16:03,00:16:04,In flagrante delicto.
285,00:16:05,00:16:07,Death by chocolate.
286,00:16:07,00:16:09,"Yeah, do you mind not sitting on that, please?"
287,00:16:12,00:16:13,Sorry.
288,00:16:13,00:16:16,You got any issues with the couch?
289,00:16:16,00:16:18,"No, no, knock yourself out."
290,00:16:18,00:16:25,"Does anybody else think it's odd that, um, the killer didn't actually kill the first girl?"
291,00:16:25,00:16:26,Maybe he was interrupted.
292,00:16:26,00:16:28,The alley crime scene was not staged.
293,00:16:28,00:16:29,RUSSELL: I don't think so.
294,00:16:29,00:16:31,I think the guy's methodical.
295,00:16:31,00:16:33,I think he wanted us to find her the way we did.
296,00:16:33,00:16:37,"I actually agree with you on that, based on my research of the Gig Harbor Killer."
297,00:16:37,00:16:40,You've got to admit there's all these similarities.
298,00:16:40,00:16:46,"The, uh, well, quasi-religious themes and the presenting of one gruesome tableaux after another."
299,00:16:46,00:16:47,This is not Gig Harbor.
300,00:16:47,00:16:49,"Yeah, I know that."
301,00:16:49,00:16:54,"But, you know, just-just like that case, we do need to start at the beginning."
302,00:16:54,00:16:59,"Yeah, Angela came to us, concerned about girls missing from the stripper church."
303,00:16:59,00:17:04,"Right, so if we want to retrace their steps, that's where we need to go."
304,00:17:04,00:17:07,MAN: I'm not here to preach damnation and hellfire.
305,00:17:07,00:17:09,I'm not gonna preach at all.
306,00:17:09,00:17:14,I'm just a messenger sent here to share my story.
307,00:17:14,00:17:17,The story...
308,00:17:17,00:17:31,"of a man who used women for his own gratification, for the urges of others in the almighty pursuit of money, power, a sweet set of wheels."
309,00:17:31,00:17:33,(inhales sharply)
310,00:17:33,00:17:36,How's it working out for you?
311,00:17:36,00:17:38,Shh.
312,00:17:38,00:17:40,Not so good.
313,00:17:40,00:17:46,"That voice, you can call it God, you can call it conscience."
314,00:17:46,00:17:49,It's what made me see a different path.
315,00:17:49,00:17:51,Proverbs.
316,00:17:51,00:17:54,"""Let not mercy and truth forsake thee."
317,00:17:54,00:17:55,"""Bind them about thy neck."
318,00:17:55,00:17:59,"Write them upon the table of thine heart."" Ooh."
319,00:17:59,00:18:03,"Lord Almighty, God..."
320,00:18:03,00:18:08,writes his name upon your heart because...
321,00:18:08,00:18:12,"when your heart breaks, his word falls in."
322,00:18:12,00:18:14,"Pray with me, brothers and sisters."
323,00:18:14,00:18:16,Excuse me. Pray with me.
324,00:18:16,00:18:17,"Can I help you? Yeah, we're with the police."
325,00:18:17,00:18:21,"Look, I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, a lot of us in here have had run-ins with the cops."
326,00:18:21,00:18:23,"We don't want to scare anybody away, so..."
327,00:18:23,00:18:24,if I can help you find who you're looking for...
328,00:18:24,00:18:26,"ANGELA: It's okay, Jake. I can handle this."
329,00:18:28,00:18:30,"Hi, Kitty. It's Angela now."
330,00:18:30,00:18:36,What can I do for you? SANDERS: We'd just like to ask you and Brother Larson some more questions about the girls.
331,00:18:36,00:18:41,LARSON: There's not a lot more I can share with you guys beside the information Angela's already given you.
332,00:18:41,00:18:44,"Well, you certainly have a lot of followers."
333,00:18:44,00:18:46,How do you suppose they found their way here?
334,00:18:46,00:18:52,"I don't have followers, and the people, they found their way here the same way I did; they hear the call."
335,00:18:52,00:19:01,"Brother Larson takes his ministry to the streets, to prisons, to shelters, and those he saves become congregants, and many of them are volunteers like me."
336,00:19:01,00:19:06,SANDERS: You happen to have a list of names of the congregants?
337,00:19:06,00:19:07,There are no names here.
338,00:19:07,00:19:17,"Uh, like that sign says, ""only fellowship."" (chuckles) Well, with all due respect, your fellowship is taking quite a hit."
339,00:19:17,00:19:21,"I mean, with two dead women, another one barely hanging on."
340,00:19:21,00:19:24,This place is a sanctuary.
341,00:19:24,00:19:27,It's outside these walls where the souls are hunted.
342,00:19:29,00:19:32,"Is this your Great Awakenings Bible, Brother?"
343,00:19:32,00:19:33,"Yes, it is."
344,00:19:35,00:19:40,So do you always make it a habit to carve your books out like that?
345,00:19:40,00:19:42,When the spirit moves me.
346,00:19:42,00:19:44,You mind if I borrow it?
347,00:19:45,00:19:47,"May it bring you comfort, brother."
348,00:19:48,00:19:51,"You know, I find it curious."
349,00:19:51,00:20:05,"Women go missing every single day, and the police don't lift a finger, and yet when one of their own daughters, like Ellie Brass, is lost, they will part the seas and tumble down the walls to find her."
350,00:20:07,00:20:11,"You question my mission, I question yours."
351,00:20:13,00:20:20,"WOMAN: You know, in the 16 years that we were married, I never saw the inside of your office at the Newark PD."
352,00:20:20,00:20:24,"Nancy, you know, you didn't really have to fly all the way out here."
353,00:20:24,00:20:28,You remember what happened the last time you tried to find her in Los Angeles by yourself?
354,00:20:28,00:20:33,"You know, I don't have the will to listen to a whole recitation of my past failures, okay?"
355,00:20:33,00:20:37,I-I can't beat myself up anymore about this.
356,00:20:38,00:20:39,Okay.
357,00:20:39,00:20:46,"I didn't tell you this on the phone, but Ellie had your engagement ring, and then she sold it to another girl."
358,00:20:51,00:20:55,"I guess, uh, she needed the money."
359,00:20:55,00:20:57,"So you saw her, then."
360,00:20:57,00:21:01,"Yeah, about a year ago, she stopped by my place in Jersey City with this guy."
361,00:21:01,00:21:03,He seemed nice.
362,00:21:03,00:21:10,"Really? Did he know about her problems or drug use, prostitution? She said she was gonna tell him."
363,00:21:13,00:21:15,"Well, you say Ellie's here."
364,00:21:15,00:21:17,"I'm here, Vegas."
365,00:21:17,00:21:19,What's going on?
366,00:21:19,00:21:21,"""What's going on""? I-I'm looking for her."
367,00:21:21,00:21:23,Don't you think I know when you're lying?
368,00:21:26,00:21:32,"You were a lousy husband, but you're a great cop."
369,00:21:32,00:21:34,Find her.
370,00:21:34,00:21:40,"MERCHISTON: I must say, running diagnostics on a computer seems incongruous for a man of action."
371,00:21:42,00:21:44,You just gonna stand there watching me like that?
372,00:21:47,00:21:49,I was thinking. Oh.
373,00:21:49,00:21:53,"Hey, I got DNA and prints off of Larson's Bible, and I got a hit in the system."
374,00:21:53,00:21:58,"Before he was Brother Larson, Daniel Larson was a street hustler working the Alphabets."
375,00:21:58,00:22:00,"Priors for pandering, pimping."
376,00:22:00,00:22:03,"At the time of his last arrest, he was found in possession of a firearm."
377,00:22:03,00:22:05,A .38.
378,00:22:05,00:22:07,It's the same caliber as the bullet we pulled out of the pimp in the freezer.
379,00:22:07,00:22:10,Maybe that's his weapon of choice.
380,00:22:10,00:22:11,"It sounds like you've got your man, doesn't it?"
381,00:22:11,00:22:14,"That might work for your editor, but it doesn't work in a court of law."
382,00:22:14,00:22:15,We need a weapon.
383,00:22:15,00:22:20,"Yeah, and besides, all of the Bibles and dowels at both crime scenes were wiped clean."
384,00:22:20,00:22:22,(beeping)
385,00:22:22,00:22:23,"Well, this is interesting."
386,00:22:23,00:22:29,It looks like the Webcam broadcast of the food fetish show was turned on remotely.
387,00:22:29,00:22:30,How?
388,00:22:30,00:22:33,By a computer at the Fellowship of the Fallen Angels.
389,00:22:35,00:22:37,(sirens wailing)
390,00:22:41,00:22:43,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going?"
391,00:22:43,00:22:44,"I'm going with you, aren't I?"
392,00:22:44,00:22:46,"When the smoke clears, I'll call you."
393,00:22:46,00:22:47,"Till then, just sit tight."
394,00:22:49,00:22:52,"SANDERS: Well, let's hope our man of God surrenders peacefully."
395,00:22:52,00:22:56,I'll be waiting by my phone.
396,00:23:02,00:23:03,Daniel Larson!
397,00:23:03,00:23:06,LVPD!
398,00:23:37,00:23:38,LARSON: I need you to pray with me now.
399,00:23:38,00:23:42,Pray on change. Pray on hope.
400,00:23:42,00:23:45,Pray on a life free from the bondage of sin.
401,00:23:45,00:23:48,"Because... oh, yes..."
402,00:23:48,00:23:50,(over speaker): the forces of darkness will tempt you.
403,00:23:50,00:23:53,They will beckon to you.
404,00:23:53,00:23:55,They will beckon to you on every corner.
405,00:23:55,00:23:56,(woman screams)
406,00:23:58,00:24:00,(woman screaming and sobbing)
407,00:24:03,00:24:05,Stay still! You need to stay still! Angela?
408,00:24:05,00:24:07,Get off of her! You don't understand.
409,00:24:07,00:24:08,Get off. Angela! Let go of me!
410,00:24:08,00:24:10,"STOKES: Right there. Don't move. All right, don't worry."
411,00:24:10,00:24:11,Do not move. We're here for you.
412,00:24:30,00:24:31,(grunts)
413,00:24:36,00:24:39,"BRASS: What kind of game are you and Larson playing, Angela?"
414,00:24:39,00:24:42,"You come to us with names and faces of missing girls, one of them my daughter."
415,00:24:42,00:24:46,Right? And Larson's taunting us with messages from the crime scene. You're wrong.
416,00:24:46,00:24:49,Brother Larson and I had nothing to do with this. We were trying to help.
417,00:24:49,00:24:51,"Mr. Russell, you know me."
418,00:24:51,00:24:52,What about the young woman we found you with?
419,00:24:52,00:24:54,The one strapped to the bed.
420,00:24:54,00:24:55,She's an addict.
421,00:24:55,00:24:57,Detoxing. She can't go to the hospital.
422,00:24:57,00:24:59,Where's Larson keeping the rest of the missing girls?
423,00:24:59,00:25:01,Where's my daughter? I don't know.
424,00:25:01,00:25:05,You're lying! You know what? You're the reason Ellie was on the street.
425,00:25:05,00:25:08,So don't accuse me of something you got only yourself to blame for.
426,00:25:10,00:25:12,I'm out of here.
427,00:25:15,00:25:17,Please say you believe me.
428,00:25:17,00:25:18,Where's Brother Larson right now?
429,00:25:18,00:25:20,I don't know.
430,00:25:20,00:25:25,"MERCHISTON: She says she doesn't know where Larson is, but I've got a pretty good idea of where he was."
431,00:25:25,00:25:27,And I've got a concussion to prove it.
432,00:25:27,00:25:29,You think she's telling the truth?
433,00:25:29,00:25:31,RUSSELL: That woman saved my life once.
434,00:25:31,00:25:36,"She may have unwittingly recruited converts for Larson, yes, but..."
435,00:25:36,00:25:38,I do believe that...
436,00:25:38,00:25:41,she was genuinely trying to help those women.
437,00:25:41,00:25:42,What about Brother Larson?
438,00:25:42,00:25:43,That's another story.
439,00:25:43,00:25:45,One I haven't figured out yet.
440,00:25:45,00:25:49,"Well, I have been giving some thought to the, uh..."
441,00:25:49,00:25:52,to the way in which the scenes were staged.
442,00:25:52,00:25:54,"Stage-managed, if you like."
443,00:25:54,00:25:55,Take a look at that bed.
444,00:25:55,00:25:57,And the table and the lamps.
445,00:25:57,00:26:04,"And then, if you look at the dessert scene, you can see the plates and the cakes, all ring shaped."
446,00:26:04,00:26:06,"Even in the alley way, which didn't appear staged."
447,00:26:06,00:26:12,"But if you look again, you've got a bicycle, a discarded mirror and a shattered clock."
448,00:26:16,00:26:17,Just like the wooden dowel.
449,00:26:17,00:26:19,We thought they were numbers.
450,00:26:19,00:26:20,Zeros.
451,00:26:20,00:26:23,He's playing games with you.
452,00:26:23,00:26:29,"Well, your killer's a man of many signatures, but the one thing that seems to be constant-- these rings."
453,00:26:30,00:26:33,"No, they're not rings."
454,00:26:33,00:26:35,They're circles.
455,00:27:45,00:27:48,We've been trying to figure out why this guy had multiple signatures.
456,00:27:48,00:27:51,"Actually, I think that he got all of his inspiration from one place."
457,00:27:51,00:27:53,Dante's Inferno.
458,00:27:53,00:27:55,The Nine Circles of Hell.
459,00:27:55,00:27:56,"First Circle, Limbo."
460,00:27:56,00:27:59,We were wondering why Teresa Hill survived.
461,00:27:59,00:28:01,It's because he wanted her to.
462,00:28:01,00:28:02,She's in a coma. She's in limbo.
463,00:28:02,00:28:03,FINLAY: Megan Ramirez.
464,00:28:03,00:28:07,Porn Star on a porn stage-- lust.
465,00:28:07,00:28:10,"Chloe Rudolph, at the dessert table-- gluttony."
466,00:28:10,00:28:13,RUSSELL: And her boyfriend who turned her out-- greed.
467,00:28:13,00:28:19,All staged to look exactly like engravings from a 16th century volume of the Divine Comedy.
468,00:28:19,00:28:22,You said he was giving us a show.
469,00:28:22,00:28:25,I'd say this looks more like a sermon.
470,00:28:25,00:28:26,"Yeah, I agree."
471,00:28:26,00:28:27,And he's not done.
472,00:28:27,00:28:29,There are other missing women.
473,00:28:29,00:28:31,This guy's gonna drop bodies until we stop him.
474,00:28:31,00:28:35,"MERCHISTON: Anger, heresy, violence, fraud, treachery."
475,00:28:35,00:28:38,"Yeah, I've seen this movie before."
476,00:28:38,00:28:40,So has Brother Larson.
477,00:28:40,00:28:41,FINLAY: Anger is obviously next.
478,00:28:41,00:28:43,But how does this really help us?
479,00:28:43,00:28:45,It gets us into his head.
480,00:28:45,00:28:47,"Beyond that, I don't really know."
481,00:28:47,00:28:53,"Well, to quote a famous man from Seattle, identifying the killer's signature is the first step in making the hunter become the hunted."
482,00:28:53,00:28:55,This is why I don't do interviews anymore.
483,00:28:55,00:29:00,"Well, considering we have so little evidence on this guy, (phone beeps) I'll give you a quote from me."
484,00:29:00,00:29:03,Sometimes we have to wait for a killer to make a mistake.
485,00:29:05,00:29:07,I think he just did.
486,00:29:11,00:29:14,Brother Larson. I'm CSI Russell.
487,00:29:14,00:29:15,And I'm confused.
488,00:29:15,00:29:18,I understand I'm being charged with a homicide.
489,00:29:18,00:29:21,"Three, actually."
490,00:29:21,00:29:23,One attempted.
491,00:29:23,00:29:30,"Teresa Hill, Megan Ramirez, Chloe Rudolph and her boyfriend, Greg Lee."
492,00:29:30,00:29:37,Ballistics on the gun found in your car when we picked you up matched the bullet taken from Greg Lee's head.
493,00:29:37,00:29:46,You also used the computer in your church to activate Chloe Rudolph's Webcam so that we would find her when you wanted us to.
494,00:29:46,00:29:51,It would seem I have enemies who seek to undo my good work.
495,00:29:51,00:29:54,Let's talk about that work. Mm-hmm.
496,00:29:54,00:29:57,"We went through your cell phone, and we found photos of women."
497,00:29:57,00:30:00,Including all of the dead girls.
498,00:30:01,00:30:05,A shepherd watches over his flock.
499,00:30:05,00:30:12,"I think that this shepherd chooses them very carefully for who they are, what they are."
500,00:30:12,00:30:14,Limbo. Lust. Gluttony.
501,00:30:14,00:30:20,"I think you obsess over them, and then I think you punish them for their sins."
502,00:30:20,00:30:23,"It's come to Jesus time, Brother."
503,00:30:23,00:30:27,You tell me where the rest of the girls are.
504,00:30:27,00:30:29,Where is Ellie Brass?
505,00:30:29,00:30:33,I am a sinner.
506,00:30:33,00:30:35,I am not a kidnapper.
507,00:30:35,00:30:39,And I am not... a murderer.
508,00:30:39,00:30:41,And I'm not a believer.
509,00:30:41,00:30:42,These are not my crimes.
510,00:30:42,00:30:48,"Look, man, these girls going missing, I got nothing to do with that."
511,00:30:48,00:30:54,My only crime-- my only crime-- is making a little money.
512,00:30:54,00:30:56,Selling a little tail.
513,00:30:56,00:30:58,Go on.
514,00:30:58,00:30:59,"I take these girls off the street, pal."
515,00:30:59,00:31:02,I give them a better life.
516,00:31:02,00:31:05,I introduce them to a better class of john.
517,00:31:05,00:31:06,"So, you're still a pimp, is what you're saying?"
518,00:31:06,00:31:08,And the pictures I sent online...
519,00:31:08,00:31:11,a client who reached out to my ministry.
520,00:31:11,00:31:12,Does that client have a name?
521,00:31:12,00:31:15,(chuckles)
522,00:31:15,00:31:17,Anonymous.
523,00:31:17,00:31:19,Arrangements are always the same.
524,00:31:19,00:31:21,"I send him pictures and bios, he picks a girl."
525,00:31:21,00:31:23,I drop her off at a corner.
526,00:31:23,00:31:24,A car comes.
527,00:31:24,00:31:29,"Up until now, my little lambs have always found their way home."
528,00:31:29,00:31:31,Why should I believe any of this?
529,00:31:31,00:31:32,"I confessed my sins already, pal."
530,00:31:32,00:31:34,I will not bear the sins of others.
531,00:31:34,00:31:36,And you prosecute me wrongly...
532,00:31:36,00:31:40,"another body will drop, and that'll be your cross to bear."
533,00:31:40,00:31:44,"Besides, if you catch this guy, you're gonna need me."
534,00:31:44,00:31:47,And I need an assurance of freedom.
535,00:31:47,00:31:48,Are you kidding me?
536,00:31:48,00:31:50,You don't have anything to bargain.
537,00:31:50,00:31:53,Ellie Brass?
538,00:31:53,00:31:54,She isn't missing.
539,00:31:55,00:31:57,I spoke to her this morning.
540,00:31:57,00:31:58,I know where she is.
541,00:31:59,00:32:02,Yeah. (chuckles)
542,00:32:02,00:32:05,I call my lawyer. We make a deal.
543,00:32:05,00:32:08,I then give you a miracle.
544,00:32:08,00:32:10,Prodigal daughter returned home.
545,00:32:13,00:32:17,ECKLIE: Think Brother Larson's playing us for fools?
546,00:32:17,00:32:19,RUSSELL: Greg processed his home computer.
547,00:32:19,00:32:22,"Found online messages from Anonymous, just like he said."
548,00:32:22,00:32:25,Guy even put in a request for another girl for tonight.
549,00:32:25,00:32:28,"Yeah, but that could just be a smoke screen, couldn't it?"
550,00:32:28,00:32:29,And elaborate alibi.
551,00:32:29,00:32:31,"ECKLIE: Yeah, it could be."
552,00:32:31,00:32:33,Greg run trace on the computer?
553,00:32:33,00:32:35,All the messages came through a file-sharing site.
554,00:32:35,00:32:40,"We could try for a warrant, but there's no law against posting pictures."
555,00:32:40,00:32:41,It's another dead end.
556,00:32:41,00:32:46,"So, if Larson is just a pimp and Anonymous is the guy doing all this, how are we ever gonna get to him?"
557,00:32:46,00:32:48,Morgan has a plan.
558,00:32:48,00:32:50,One that I think the DA will be very interested in.
559,00:32:50,00:32:52,Let's hear it.
560,00:32:52,00:32:56,"Anonymous is requesting another girl for tonight, to add to his collection."
561,00:32:56,00:32:58,So let's give him one.
562,00:32:58,00:33:00,Use Larson to do it.
563,00:33:00,00:33:04,"MERCHISTON: We know the guy posts pictures, the women get dropped off on the corner and taken up to his flat."
564,00:33:04,00:33:06,"Obviously, you have someone in mind."
565,00:33:06,00:33:08,"Yeah. I worked undercover in L.A., Dad."
566,00:33:08,00:33:10,I know what I'm doing.
567,00:33:10,00:33:13,"You never dealt with anything like this in L.A., Morgan."
568,00:33:13,00:33:15,"Right now, I'm not your daughter; I'm LVPD."
569,00:33:15,00:33:16,And now you're the sheriff.
570,00:33:16,00:33:18,You're gonna have to make tough decisions.
571,00:33:18,00:33:19,I really don't need you to tell me...
572,00:33:19,00:33:21,"All right, whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Come on. Come on."
573,00:33:21,00:33:23,Take a deep breath here.
574,00:33:23,00:33:27,"Obviously, Morgan is taking a huge risk by doing something like this."
575,00:33:27,00:33:32,"But without an undercover operation, we are all just sitting around waiting for another body to drop."
576,00:33:32,00:33:34,You got into the killer's mind.
577,00:33:34,00:33:36,Maybe I can get into his home.
578,00:33:36,00:33:38,Get him to reveal himself.
579,00:33:38,00:33:41,"Now, look, the crime scene suggests this man's a narcissist."
580,00:33:41,00:33:42,He's a showoff. He can't help himself.
581,00:33:42,00:33:47,"He likes to brag, so maybe he's going to brag to this young lady."
582,00:33:47,00:33:49,Morgan's plan is a good one.
583,00:33:49,00:33:54,And there are other daughters who are out there right now in danger and fathers who are worried about them.
584,00:33:54,00:33:56,We know one of them.
585,00:33:59,00:34:01,"I need to do this, Dad."
586,00:34:16,00:34:17,BRODY: How do I look?
587,00:34:17,00:34:18,Looking good.
588,00:34:18,00:34:20,"Unit one, you're in position?"
589,00:34:20,00:34:21,MAN (over radio): Roger that.
590,00:34:21,00:34:23,Unit two. Nick? Greg?
591,00:34:23,00:34:25,"Yeah, we got eyes on her."
592,00:34:26,00:34:28,(sighs)
593,00:34:37,00:34:39,Looks like it's on.
594,00:34:44,00:34:45,We're on the move.
595,00:34:45,00:34:47,ECKLIE: Copy.
596,00:35:21,00:35:22,(knocking)
597,00:35:25,00:35:27,"Well, well."
598,00:35:27,00:35:30,Pretty as a picture.
599,00:35:30,00:35:31,Please.
600,00:35:31,00:35:33,Come in.
601,00:35:44,00:35:46,Are you an art lover?
602,00:35:46,00:35:48,Not really.
603,00:35:48,00:35:50,You an art collector?
604,00:35:50,00:35:51,No.
605,00:35:51,00:35:55,I just like beautiful things.
606,00:35:55,00:36:03,"Even when they're about something hideous, like suffering..."
607,00:36:03,00:36:05,damnation...
608,00:36:05,00:36:06,hell.
609,00:36:06,00:36:08,Think we got our guy.
610,00:36:08,00:36:09,Got an I.D. on him yet?
611,00:36:09,00:36:10,"Yeah, I'm running his address right now."
612,00:36:10,00:36:12,Oliver Tate.
613,00:36:12,00:36:14,Doesn't have a criminal record.
614,00:36:14,00:36:15,"M.D., Ph.D."
615,00:36:15,00:36:18,Works for a biotech company.
616,00:36:18,00:36:23,"TATE: And, truth be told, I am man of science."
617,00:36:23,00:36:27,Guess that explains all this stuff.
618,00:36:27,00:36:29,This stuff...
619,00:36:29,00:36:33,are the tools that man has used to seek knowledge.
620,00:36:33,00:36:40,"To look deeper into the mysteries of the world, to educate the beast."
621,00:36:40,00:36:41,This is really cool.
622,00:36:41,00:36:42,What is it?
623,00:36:42,00:36:44,TATE: My prized possession.
624,00:36:44,00:36:46,It's kind of an abacus from the 16th century.
625,00:36:46,00:36:50,"They're called ""Balliol's Bones."" I don't like this."
626,00:36:50,00:36:52,She's in control. She's gaining his trust.
627,00:36:52,00:36:54,(cell phone beeps)
628,00:36:54,00:36:57,Be right back.
629,00:37:01,00:37:02,RUSSELL: When did this arrive?
630,00:37:02,00:37:05,"Around, uh, midnight. I couldn't sleep."
631,00:37:05,00:37:10,"I went down to the bar for a drink, and when I came back, it was outside my door."
632,00:37:10,00:37:12,Okay.
633,00:37:15,00:37:16,Is that blood?
634,00:37:16,00:37:17,What the hell is that inside?
635,00:37:17,00:37:19,Looks like a flash drive.
636,00:37:19,00:37:20,TATE: This...
637,00:37:20,00:37:22,is for you.
638,00:37:35,00:37:37,Anger.
639,00:37:37,00:37:39,"Well, you are the angry girl."
640,00:37:41,00:37:43,At least that's what Larson promised me.
641,00:37:43,00:37:46,You care to tell me why?
642,00:37:46,00:37:48,You first.
643,00:37:48,00:37:54,"Tell me why a good-looking, rich guy like you has to pay for company."
644,00:37:54,00:37:57,"Pleasure, of course."
645,00:37:57,00:37:59,"Pain, too?"
646,00:38:01,00:38:06,It's my experience that women like you who want to be bad...
647,00:38:06,00:38:09,who want to be punished...
648,00:38:09,00:38:14,have one thing in common: daddy issues.
649,00:38:15,00:38:17,BRODY: You know me too well.
650,00:38:17,00:38:21,Brother Larson told me you have certain...
651,00:38:21,00:38:22,tastes.
652,00:38:22,00:38:24,"Oh, don't worry, I don't bite."
653,00:38:24,00:38:26,Wouldn't matter if you did.
654,00:38:26,00:38:28,You're the one in control here.
655,00:38:28,00:38:31,You can do anything you want to me.
656,00:38:37,00:38:40,You want to hear a dirty little secret?
657,00:38:40,00:38:41,(Brody giggles)
658,00:38:44,00:38:50,It turns me on when men talk about their conquests.
659,00:38:50,00:38:52,Their...
660,00:38:52,00:38:54,previous adventures.
661,00:38:57,00:39:00,Don't you want to turn me on?
662,00:39:03,00:39:06,I know I am not the first girl to ever receive a present from you.
663,00:39:06,00:39:09,"So, come on."
664,00:39:09,00:39:11,We've got all night.
665,00:39:11,00:39:13,I'm not going anywhere.
666,00:39:13,00:39:15,Take off your clothes.
667,00:39:17,00:39:21,TATE: I like to see what I'm paying for.
668,00:39:35,00:39:36,I shouldn't be here.
669,00:39:36,00:39:38,"Unit one, what's your 20?"
670,00:39:38,00:39:40,MAN: We're in the lobby. I want you up on that floor-- I want you close.
671,00:39:40,00:39:42,I'm coming there now.
672,00:39:42,00:39:43,"Anything happens, you radio me."
673,00:39:43,00:39:45,I will.
674,00:39:51,00:39:54,Lovely.
675,00:39:54,00:39:58,I just hate unnecessary adornment.
676,00:39:58,00:39:59,"TATE: Oh, sorry."
677,00:39:59,00:40:01,Did I hurt you?
678,00:40:01,00:40:03,No.
679,00:40:03,00:40:05,(scoffs)
680,00:40:08,00:40:10,"Suddenly, I'm not in the mood."
681,00:40:10,00:40:13,(laughs)
682,00:40:13,00:40:16,Did I do something wrong?
683,00:40:19,00:40:21,Maybe another night.
684,00:40:23,00:40:25,But you said you liked what you saw.
685,00:40:27,00:40:29,"Oh, I do."
686,00:40:29,00:40:33,My driver will take you back.
687,00:40:44,00:40:46,RUSSELL: Fraud.
