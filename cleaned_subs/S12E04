0,00:00:21,00:00:23,PHOTOGRAPHER: Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
1,00:00:23,00:00:25,"PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Mr. Mayor, over here!"
2,00:00:28,00:00:36,"RUSSELL: The story of the Mob is the story of America: Ellis Island to Brooklyn, Chicago, Kansas City..."
3,00:00:36,00:00:39,"finally, Vegas-- ticket to the American Dream."
4,00:00:39,00:00:42,"Well, my great-grandfather came here from Wales."
5,00:00:42,00:00:43,He didn't become a gangster.
6,00:00:43,00:00:45,He drove a bread truck.
7,00:00:45,00:00:52,"Huh. ""Weapons and personal items on loan from the Las Vegas Police Department."" That's one way to empty your evidence vault."
8,00:00:52,00:00:53,"Yeah, don't get me started."
9,00:00:53,00:00:58,"Mr. Mayor, you've taken heat from Italian-American groups accusing you of stereotyping."
10,00:00:58,00:00:59,"Why not call it ""The Guido Museum""?"
11,00:00:59,00:01:00,Come on.
12,00:01:00,00:01:02,Mobsters come in all flavors.
13,00:01:02,00:01:06,"You got Meyer Lansky, you got Bugsy Siegel, you got Moe, you got Moe, you got Moe."
14,00:01:06,00:01:08,They're really equal opportunity employers.
15,00:01:13,00:01:14,Congratulations.
16,00:01:14,00:01:16,Hmm?
17,00:01:16,00:01:18,Oscar put your dad in the Spilotro exhibit.
18,00:01:18,00:01:21,Forgot how handsome he was.
19,00:01:21,00:01:26,"""Goodfella's daughter turns CSI."" That's an amazing story."
20,00:01:26,00:01:29,"No, Sam wasn't a goodfella."
21,00:01:29,00:01:31,"No, he was a playfella."
22,00:01:31,00:01:34,"When a goodfella wanted to party, Sam was the go-to guy."
23,00:01:34,00:01:38,"He provided the women, the supplies, the favors, the security."
24,00:01:38,00:01:41,And those same goodfellas hired Sam to run their casinos.
25,00:01:41,00:01:45,"He was connected, but no killer."
26,00:01:45,00:01:46,"Nice spin, Greg."
27,00:01:46,00:01:54,"Sam-- well, all these guys-- they were no angels, but family did come first, and they knew how to provide."
28,00:01:54,00:01:55,No kidding.
29,00:01:55,00:01:57,Sam gave her a casino.
30,00:01:57,00:02:00,I didn't even get the family wagon.
31,00:02:00,00:02:02,Are you here with your wife?
32,00:02:02,00:02:05,"Uh, yeah, yeah, uh... my work wife."
33,00:02:05,00:02:06,Ecklie's over there.
34,00:02:06,00:02:07,Mm.
35,00:02:07,00:02:10,"(hushed): Hey, guys, look-- right there."
36,00:02:10,00:02:12,Why are we whispering?
37,00:02:12,00:02:15,Out of respect for the pack of Mob widows.
38,00:02:15,00:02:21,"We got Mrs. Tony ""Revolvers"" Meli, Mrs. Vinnie ""Whack Job"" Sapphire and Mrs. Stu ""Greenbacks"" Greenberg..."
39,00:02:21,00:02:22,together.
40,00:02:22,00:02:24,Unbelievable.
41,00:02:24,00:02:25,Why's that unbelievable?
42,00:02:25,00:02:27,"Well, Whack Job was Lou Gedda's hitman."
43,00:02:27,00:02:32,He whacked Greenberg while he was at his own diamond anniversary and popped Meli while he was at the cardiologist.
44,00:02:32,00:02:34,And Whack Job?
45,00:02:34,00:02:35,Got arrested for all that whacking.
46,00:02:35,00:02:37,Jumped bail.
47,00:02:37,00:02:38,No one's seen him in 20 years.
48,00:02:38,00:02:41,"RUSSELL: Well, it's nice to see the wives have stayed in touch."
49,00:02:41,00:02:42,Yeah.
50,00:02:42,00:02:44,"(sound effect of machine guns firing, crowd screams)"
51,00:02:44,00:02:45,(laughs)
52,00:02:48,00:02:51,Not so comfortable being around all these Mobsters.
53,00:02:51,00:02:54,"Like it or not, they're the founding fathers of Vegas."
54,00:02:57,00:02:59,(music stops)
55,00:02:59,00:03:00,"Thank you, everybody, for coming here."
56,00:03:00,00:03:05,"I've been waiting for this for ten years, the opening of the Mob Museum."
57,00:03:05,00:03:09,"In particular, I want to thank our sheriff, Sheriff Liston. Thank you for your support."
58,00:03:09,00:03:14,"You know, when I was running for mayor, the advice I got was, ""Don't talk about your past."
59,00:03:14,00:03:16,Don't talk about the wiseguys that you defended.
60,00:03:16,00:03:21,"And I said, ""Bull, I'm gonna do it the way I want to do,"" and I got elected three times."
61,00:03:21,00:03:23,This museum's gonna be very special.
62,00:03:23,00:03:30,"This is gonna tell the real story, the real story of Las Vegas and organized crime, warts and all."
63,00:03:30,00:03:35,"So, with that, everybody raise your glass and we'll say, ""Salud""!"
64,00:03:35,00:03:37,"(machine gun sound effect, followed by loud gunshots)"
65,00:03:37,00:03:38,"(guests scream, shout)"
66,00:03:44,00:03:46,Get the medics and secure the building!
67,00:03:46,00:03:48,(indistinct police radio communication)
68,00:03:48,00:03:52,ECKLIE: Take these people into the lobby and get their statements.
69,00:03:52,00:03:54,(sirens approaching outside)
70,00:03:54,00:03:56,An attempt on the life of the ex-Mayor.
71,00:03:56,00:03:57,My ass is hanging out here.
72,00:03:57,00:03:58,You better solve this quick.
73,00:03:58,00:04:01,"Loud and clear, ma'am."
74,00:04:03,00:04:06,They just rolled the mayor into the ER.
75,00:04:06,00:04:07,Looks like he's gonna be okay.
76,00:04:07,00:04:09,Great. SANDERS: Hit in a Mob museum?
77,00:04:09,00:04:10,It has to be a publicity stunt.
78,00:04:10,00:04:15,"ECKLIE: Sanders, if the former mayor was gonna stage his own assassination, I would've known about it."
79,00:04:15,00:04:17,And I think I would've told him no.
80,00:04:17,00:04:19,So I guess he got lucky tonight.
81,00:04:19,00:04:20,"(phone ringing) Yeah, I'll say."
82,00:04:20,00:04:21,Ecklie.
83,00:04:21,00:04:23,(whispering): Come here.
84,00:04:23,00:04:25,"Well, how about the sheriff does the press conference this time?"
85,00:04:25,00:04:29,"Okay, I heard four shots fairly close by..."
86,00:04:29,00:04:31,to the east of here.
87,00:04:40,00:04:41,"Oh, there we go."
88,00:04:41,00:04:43,Do you have a...?
89,00:04:44,00:04:45,"Uh, never mind."
90,00:04:45,00:04:46,Thank you.
91,00:04:50,00:04:52,.38 Colt revolver.
92,00:04:54,00:04:56,Four rounds fired.
93,00:04:56,00:04:57,Just like the real mobsters.
94,00:04:57,00:05:00,"Dump your piece, then peace, out."
95,00:05:00,00:05:05,"As Oscar was going down, I heard more shots coming from that direction."
96,00:05:05,00:05:08,Why don't you and I take a little walk?
97,00:05:08,00:05:09,Thank you very much.
98,00:05:09,00:05:12,"Greg, uh, why don't you go get your kit?"
99,00:05:12,00:05:15,"Start processing from the podium out, all right?"
100,00:05:18,00:05:20,WILLOWS: Somebody shot Lou Gedda...
101,00:05:20,00:05:23,again.
102,00:05:23,00:05:26,Two bullets in him.
103,00:05:26,00:05:31,Glass broken on both sides.
104,00:05:35,00:05:38,I guess a shot or two could have gotten through.
105,00:05:40,00:05:42,Mayor was at the podium.
106,00:05:42,00:05:44,Not the best shot in the house.
107,00:05:44,00:05:45,But maybe the best cover.
108,00:05:46,00:05:48,Looks like a .38.
109,00:05:48,00:05:52,"Okay, shots come from two different places."
110,00:05:52,00:05:53,"Same caliber, same time."
111,00:05:53,00:05:55,Two shooters.
112,00:05:55,00:05:59,"If the shooters left through the front door, somebody would've seen them."
113,00:06:13,00:06:17,Uh-oh.
114,00:06:17,00:06:18,Body.
115,00:06:21,00:06:22,Security guard.
116,00:06:30,00:06:33,Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special.
117,00:06:36,00:06:38,Got two shots off before he snorted a bullet.
118,00:06:43,00:06:46,Got a tire impression in water.
119,00:06:46,00:06:50,Better snap it before it dries.
120,00:06:55,00:06:57,Hold still.
121,00:06:57,00:07:02,"What are you doing? Trust me, you're gonna want to remember the night they shot Oscar Goodman."
122,00:07:03,00:07:05,You look great.
123,00:07:42,00:07:45,"BRODY: The former mayor gets shot, and we're here."
124,00:07:45,00:07:47,What do you gotta do to pull the primo cases?
125,00:07:47,00:07:49,"Well, if you ask me, they're all primo."
126,00:07:49,00:07:52,"And hey, look at the bright side, you get to work with me."
127,00:07:52,00:07:53,That's the bright side?
128,00:07:53,00:07:54,Oh...
129,00:08:07,00:08:10,Somebody had a good time.
130,00:08:10,00:08:13,And somebody didn't.
131,00:08:13,00:08:15,It's Maria Garza.
132,00:08:15,00:08:16,She's the housekeeper for this suite.
133,00:08:16,00:08:20,"If she were a bartender, I'd say someone didn't like their martini."
134,00:08:23,00:08:25,"God, people are pigs."
135,00:08:25,00:08:27,"BRASS: So, Mrs. Garza works nights from midnight to 8:00 a.m."
136,00:08:27,00:08:31,The Head of Housekeeping found her when she didn't show up for her union break.
137,00:08:31,00:08:34,94.1.
138,00:08:34,00:08:36,Been dead roughly three hours.
139,00:08:36,00:08:39,"Puts T.O.D. around, what, 3:00 a.m.? Yeah."
140,00:08:39,00:08:40,Who's the suite registered to?
141,00:08:40,00:08:42,(phone ringing) Prince Jalal Najib.
142,00:08:42,00:08:43,Rapper?
143,00:08:43,00:08:45,East Coast or West Coast?
144,00:08:45,00:08:47,"More, uh... Middle East."
145,00:08:47,00:08:50,Yeah. Brass. Go ahead. Okay.
146,00:08:50,00:08:51,Be right there.
147,00:08:51,00:08:53,"Well, my prince awaits..."
148,00:08:53,00:08:55,"at the gaming table, of course."
149,00:08:55,00:08:57,So I'll practice my curtsey on the way to the elevator.
150,00:09:01,00:09:03,"I'm guessing this is a first, Dave?"
151,00:09:03,00:09:05,Definitely my first swizzle-stick.
152,00:09:05,00:09:07,Looks like the maid came in to clean up and got interrupted.
153,00:09:07,00:09:12,"Yeah, check out the table... and the glasses."
154,00:09:12,00:09:14,Can't tell if that's from the party or the struggle.
155,00:09:14,00:09:18,Her skirt's hiked up.
156,00:09:18,00:09:20,Possible sexual assault.
157,00:09:21,00:09:23,Maybe she got jumped.
158,00:09:23,00:09:24,Tried to get away.
159,00:09:24,00:09:26,(screams)
160,00:09:26,00:09:30,The last thing a prince needs is some hotel maid crying rape.
161,00:09:30,00:09:36,"She tried to take off, and he just grabs the nearest weapon, and bam."
162,00:09:39,00:09:43,"And then he just leaves her here, goes to the casino?"
163,00:09:43,00:09:47,"Maybe in his kingdom, he gets away with whatever he wants to, including murder."
164,00:10:01,00:10:02,Got a problem?
165,00:10:02,00:10:04,Yeah.
166,00:10:04,00:10:09,Found the bullet that shattered the mayor's martini glass.
167,00:10:09,00:10:11,But I haven't been able to find any other bullets.
168,00:10:11,00:10:14,"Probably find them in the mayor, right?"
169,00:10:14,00:10:16,"Well, yeah, but then where's the blood?"
170,00:10:16,00:10:18,"If you get shot, you bleed."
171,00:10:18,00:10:20,That's a good point.
172,00:10:24,00:10:27,"Okay, we know four shots came from my left."
173,00:10:27,00:10:31,First one takes out my martini.
174,00:10:31,00:10:34,Next three are direct hits.
175,00:10:34,00:10:35,"(imitates ""ping"" of bullet hits)"
176,00:10:42,00:10:45,You plan on staying down there for a while?
177,00:10:47,00:10:49,Can I see your flashlight for a sec?
178,00:10:55,00:10:57,"Oh, yeah."
179,00:10:57,00:10:58,I'm sorry. Glove?
180,00:11:01,00:11:03,Thank you.
181,00:11:10,00:11:11,Mushroomed bullet.
182,00:11:11,00:11:13,There was no damage to the podium.
183,00:11:13,00:11:15,What else could it have hit?
184,00:11:15,00:11:17,Another good point.
185,00:11:17,00:11:20,"Well, my obituary can wait."
186,00:11:20,00:11:21,I made the front page.
187,00:11:21,00:11:23,Both papers.
188,00:11:24,00:11:26,"Get this in a department store, did you?"
189,00:11:26,00:11:28,I wouldn't wear a store-made suit.
190,00:11:28,00:11:31,I got a tailor in Bogota. He's the greatest.
191,00:11:31,00:11:33,This is a bullet-proof suit.
192,00:11:33,00:11:35,Guess it comes with a lifetime guarantee?
193,00:11:35,00:11:38,"Yeah. You get shot, and they fix it for free."
194,00:11:43,00:11:45,Is that one of the bullets?
195,00:11:45,00:11:47,Yeah. Looks like it.
196,00:11:50,00:11:53,I've never seen one of these before.
197,00:11:53,00:11:56,So who are you afraid of? I'm not afraid.
198,00:11:56,00:11:57,I'm just prepared.
199,00:11:57,00:12:01,"Hell, I was the mayor for 12 years and you don't get everybody's vote."
200,00:12:01,00:12:04,"And in my old life, I represented wiseguys who had legal trouble and couldn't get all of them off."
201,00:12:04,00:12:06,"So you got a lot of enemies, do you?"
202,00:12:06,00:12:09,"Which is why I got to be bulletproof, baby."
203,00:12:09,00:12:10,And you got a lot of work to do.
204,00:12:14,00:12:17,"(woman crying, sniffling)"
205,00:12:25,00:12:26,Hi.
206,00:12:28,00:12:31,I'm CSI Brody.
207,00:12:31,00:12:32,"Are you okay, ma'am?"
208,00:12:32,00:12:36,No.
209,00:12:36,00:12:38,Maria was my friend.
210,00:12:38,00:12:41,We worked together for six years.
211,00:12:41,00:12:42,So you knew her well.
212,00:12:42,00:12:44,I'm sorry.
213,00:12:44,00:12:47,She was a good person.
214,00:12:47,00:12:49,A kind person.
215,00:12:49,00:12:52,Her husband lost his job.
216,00:12:52,00:12:56,She was supporting him and her four kids.
217,00:12:56,00:12:59,Were you working on this floor last night?
218,00:12:59,00:13:02,Yes. Here.
219,00:13:02,00:13:04,In this suite.
220,00:13:04,00:13:06,"So, did you hear anything?"
221,00:13:06,00:13:07,"A scream, a fight?"
222,00:13:07,00:13:11,No. It was too loud.
223,00:13:11,00:13:13,The party.
224,00:13:13,00:13:16,Did you see Maria go into the suite during the party?
225,00:13:19,00:13:20,"Hey, it's okay."
226,00:13:20,00:13:22,Don't be afraid.
227,00:13:22,00:13:25,I just want to help Maria's family.
228,00:13:25,00:13:28,He was very demanding.
229,00:13:28,00:13:29,The prince.
230,00:13:29,00:13:33,He was here a lot.
231,00:13:33,00:13:35,Same suite.
232,00:13:35,00:13:37,He would always ask for Maria.
233,00:13:37,00:13:42,"Some nights he would even call her ten, 20 times."
234,00:13:42,00:13:46,Did the prince ever make inappropriate demands of Maria?
235,00:13:46,00:13:48,She wouldn't say.
236,00:13:48,00:13:51,She never complained.
237,00:13:51,00:13:55,"Like me, she was just happy to have a job."
238,00:14:39,00:14:43,"Apparently, the prince was no prince when it came to demanding extra services from the maid."
239,00:14:43,00:14:45,You mean of a sexual variety?
240,00:14:45,00:14:47,Signs point that way.
241,00:14:47,00:14:49,So does this camera I just found.
242,00:14:49,00:14:51,It was pointed right at the bed.
243,00:14:51,00:14:53,Somebody's been taking home movies.
244,00:14:53,00:14:56,And it's rigged to transmit to a remote location.
245,00:14:56,00:14:59,I'll run the serial number.
246,00:14:59,00:15:01,See if I can get some prints off of it.
247,00:15:01,00:15:04,"In the meantime, why don't you print His Majesty."
248,00:15:04,00:15:06,Find out what his deal is.
249,00:15:12,00:15:16,I hear I almost had our mayor on my table.
250,00:15:16,00:15:17,"Sorry, Doc, not his time."
251,00:15:17,00:15:20,Don't be sorry; I voted for him three times.
252,00:15:20,00:15:22,"Four, if you count his wife."
253,00:15:22,00:15:24,He's done great things for our town.
254,00:15:24,00:15:27,"Oh, I agree. Mostly."
255,00:15:27,00:15:28,(chuckles)
256,00:15:28,00:15:31,So I can guess C.O.D.-- gunshot wound to the nose.
257,00:15:31,00:15:33,Anything else interesting?
258,00:15:33,00:15:34,Yes.
259,00:15:36,00:15:41,"Sooting, stippling, lead smoke around the entry point."
260,00:15:41,00:15:43,Shooter was less than a foot away.
261,00:15:43,00:15:44,So the guard almost caught him.
262,00:15:44,00:15:47,"Well, he definitely caught a bullet."
263,00:15:47,00:15:49,"A .38, I presume."
264,00:15:49,00:15:51,To match my growing collection.
265,00:15:54,00:15:55,Huh.
266,00:15:56,00:15:59,Your .38 put on some weight.
267,00:15:59,00:16:02,That looks like a .44.
268,00:16:04,00:16:06,Can't wait to tell Ecklie.
269,00:16:06,00:16:07,We've got three shooters.
270,00:16:13,00:16:15,"BRASS: So, Prince, do you know this woman?"
271,00:16:15,00:16:17,No.
272,00:16:17,00:16:21,She's a maid at your hotel-- Maria Garza.
273,00:16:21,00:16:23,"All those messes you made, she cleaned them up."
274,00:16:23,00:16:25,And?
275,00:16:25,00:16:26,And she's dead.
276,00:16:26,00:16:28,What's that got to do with me?
277,00:16:28,00:16:29,Her body was found in your suite.
278,00:16:29,00:16:31,Come on in.
279,00:16:31,00:16:33,You're talking about the hired help.
280,00:16:33,00:16:36,Hotel security told me about the little party you had last night.
281,00:16:36,00:16:40,It was so good they had to shut it down around 2:00 a.m.
282,00:16:40,00:16:42,So where did you go for the after party?
283,00:16:42,00:16:43,The spa.
284,00:16:43,00:16:45,"And from there, the casino."
285,00:16:45,00:16:47,"Which is where you found me. Ready, Captain."
286,00:16:47,00:16:49,This is CSI Brody.
287,00:16:49,00:16:52,I'm hired to take your prints and DNA.
288,00:16:52,00:16:55,Didn't I see you at the Marquee Day Club yesterday?
289,00:16:56,00:16:58,Yeah... topless.
290,00:16:58,00:17:01,Remove your watch and jewelry.
291,00:17:01,00:17:04,Do you have a male assistant?
292,00:17:05,00:17:10,"If it would make you feel more comfortable, I'll let you give me a thousand bucks when we're finished."
293,00:17:28,00:17:29,Open up.
294,00:17:31,00:17:33,I get paid by the hour.
295,00:17:42,00:17:44,Excuse me.
296,00:17:47,00:17:48,(knocks twice)
297,00:17:51,00:17:53,Word is you like stories.
298,00:17:53,00:17:55,I got a good one.
299,00:17:55,00:17:57,I'm on the edge of my seat.
300,00:17:57,00:18:01,.38 Colt dumped at the museum is definitely the gun that shot Oscar Goodman.
301,00:18:01,00:18:04,Ran the test fires through IBIS.
302,00:18:04,00:18:06,Gun's connected to seven prior shootings.
303,00:18:06,00:18:10,And here's your Mickey Spillane-- All seven date back to the '80s.
304,00:18:12,00:18:14,Wow.
305,00:18:14,00:18:16,Tough decade for Italian surnames.
306,00:18:16,00:18:18,Will you excuse me just a second?
307,00:18:18,00:18:19,Greg!
308,00:18:19,00:18:23,"Tell me one more time, how do you pronounce your name?"
309,00:18:23,00:18:24,Xiomara.
310,00:18:24,00:18:25,Xiomara.
311,00:18:25,00:18:27,What did I do?
312,00:18:27,00:18:29,Do you know any of these guys?
313,00:18:32,00:18:35,Know 'em? It's like a who's who of who's dead.
314,00:18:35,00:18:37,Joey Scarlatta sold Gedda his strip joint.
315,00:18:37,00:18:39,Capped the day the deal closed.
316,00:18:39,00:18:40,"Vinnie ""The Moose"" Moosetti."
317,00:18:40,00:18:42,Gedda's mechanic.
318,00:18:42,00:18:43,Until the brakes were put on him.
319,00:18:43,00:18:46,"Tommy ""Capicola"" Cappiletti. Butcher."
320,00:18:46,00:18:47,Gedda's ex-brother-in-law...
321,00:18:47,00:18:50,"Yeah, I get it, I get it-- he was ex'd."
322,00:18:50,00:18:52,Right?
323,00:18:52,00:18:54,All seven shootings went cold.
324,00:18:54,00:18:57,"Yeah, but that doesn't mean that everybody didn't know who did them."
325,00:18:57,00:19:00,It was Gedda's hit man Vinnie Sapphire.
326,00:19:00,00:19:02,"All right, ""Tru Crime"" you know so much."
327,00:19:02,00:19:04,What's his last known?
328,00:19:04,00:19:05,Unknown.
329,00:19:05,00:19:07,Sapphire's been missing for the last 20 years.
330,00:19:07,00:19:08,"Yeah, well, his wife's not."
331,00:19:11,00:19:13,I'll tell Brass. Bring her in.
332,00:19:13,00:19:14,Good work.
333,00:19:14,00:19:15,Now go away.
334,00:19:18,00:19:20,"So, Brassy, what's with the sit-down?"
335,00:19:20,00:19:21,You finally find Vinnie?
336,00:19:21,00:19:24,"No, but we found his gun."
337,00:19:24,00:19:28,"Oh. Well, he always liked 'em bright and shiny, just like his bimbos."
338,00:19:28,00:19:32,"Well, this bright and shiny shot Oscar Goodman last night."
339,00:19:32,00:19:37,"I'm thinking maybe Vinnie came home. Well, if he came home, he didn't come home to me."
340,00:19:37,00:19:42,"But if there's anything that would bring Vinnie back from the dead, it's Oscar Goodman's Mob museum."
341,00:19:42,00:19:46,"No induction for Vinnie, after all he did."
342,00:19:46,00:19:47,That is a crime.
343,00:19:47,00:19:50,And maybe motive to put a couple holes in the mayor.
344,00:19:50,00:19:52,But he had help.
345,00:19:52,00:19:55,"Well, don't look at me. I like Oscar."
346,00:19:55,00:19:56,(chuckling): Yeah.
347,00:19:56,00:19:58,I contributed to his campaigns.
348,00:19:58,00:20:01,"Now, Vinnie, he felt different."
349,00:20:01,00:20:03,And for good reason if you remember.
350,00:20:03,00:20:07,"Oscar refused to rep him, even when Vinnie was facing the needle."
351,00:20:07,00:20:12,Gave him some BS excuse about looking for the good in his clients and not seeing any in Vinnie.
352,00:20:12,00:20:14,"I mean, what kind of lawyer is that?"
353,00:20:14,00:20:15,You're right.
354,00:20:15,00:20:18,Good guys don't need lawyers.
355,00:20:18,00:20:20,What about you?
356,00:20:20,00:20:23,"Look, Vinnie bailed on me and our marriage after 20 years."
357,00:20:23,00:20:27,"If he walked in this room right now, I'd tell him the same thing I'd tell you: to stuff it."
358,00:20:30,00:20:31,I'll give you a tip.
359,00:20:31,00:20:43,"If that bastard needed help with anything like taking out the mayor, you should do what Vinnie always did-- look for a new piece of ass."
360,00:20:43,00:20:46,I just never understood how Vinnie could leave you.
361,00:20:46,00:20:47,"Well, that's because you're a gentleman."
362,00:20:49,00:20:51,"Look, I got to get back to my crap job."
363,00:20:54,00:21:01,"If you ever find yourself in the vicinity of Tom's Bar on Corvell, why don't you stop in?"
364,00:21:01,00:21:05,I'll refill that bottle of whiskey you keep in your drawer.
365,00:21:13,00:21:15,Hodges. Hey.
366,00:21:15,00:21:18,I have a 1979 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.
367,00:21:18,00:21:20,They used one of these in the movie Goodfellas.
368,00:21:20,00:21:24,This one starred in circling the museum for about an hour last night.
369,00:21:24,00:21:25,Sam used to have one just like it.
370,00:21:25,00:21:28,I took my driving test in it. Couldn't fail.
371,00:21:28,00:21:30,I failed.
372,00:21:30,00:21:31,Twice.
373,00:21:31,00:21:33,Still get nightmares about all those cones.
374,00:21:33,00:21:38,So what about the tire impressions in the alley?
375,00:21:38,00:21:41,"Well, here's where we enter the world of oddfellas."
376,00:21:41,00:21:43,"Or, more precisely, Detroit."
377,00:21:43,00:21:46,Tire impressions were made by bias plies.
378,00:21:46,00:21:50,Same specs as you would find in factory tires on a '79 Caddy.
379,00:21:50,00:21:53,Bet you can't guess what kind of car Vinnie drove?
380,00:21:53,00:21:56,A '79 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.
381,00:21:56,00:22:00,HODGES: I confirmed that with DMV.
382,00:22:00,00:22:01,And...
383,00:22:03,00:22:04,"Plate's a match, too."
384,00:22:06,00:22:09,"Vinnie's car, Vinnie's gun..."
385,00:22:09,00:22:10,HODGES: Vinnie's suit and hat.
386,00:22:10,00:22:12,Vinnie's back.
387,00:22:17,00:22:20,STOKES: Maria Garza's autopsy showed showed no signs of vaginal trauma.
388,00:22:20,00:22:21,SAE kit was negative for semen.
389,00:22:21,00:22:24,"Just because the prince couldn't close the deal, doesn't mean he didn't kill her."
390,00:22:24,00:22:25,That's true.
391,00:22:25,00:22:27,We're still processing his clothes.
392,00:22:27,00:22:29,"Okay, well, I ran the serial number on the lipstick cam."
393,00:22:29,00:22:30,Came back to a store in Henderson.
394,00:22:30,00:22:32,Buyer paid cash.
395,00:22:32,00:22:34,I was able to pull some partials off of that.
396,00:22:34,00:22:37,Andy's running it right now.
397,00:22:37,00:22:38,My money's on the prince.
398,00:22:38,00:22:45,"He gets one of his crew to install the camera, that way, whatever happens in Vegas doesn't have to stay in Vegas."
399,00:22:45,00:22:47,He can have movie night at the palace.
400,00:22:47,00:22:50,"He really did piss you off, didn't he?"
401,00:22:50,00:22:52,"You know, there is another way to look at this."
402,00:22:52,00:22:56,"That's a cheap consumer camera, access to the suite was easy."
403,00:22:56,00:22:58,You said Maria's husband was out of work.
404,00:22:58,00:23:00,She was supporting the family.
405,00:23:00,00:23:02,Maybe Maria saw an opportunity here.
406,00:23:02,00:23:05,Gives the prince even more motive.
407,00:23:05,00:23:06,It gives us more than that.
408,00:23:06,00:23:10,"If that camera recorded the murder, we need to get our hands on that video footage."
409,00:23:12,00:23:13,You're hovering again.
410,00:23:13,00:23:16,Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
411,00:23:16,00:23:17,We both wore purple today.
412,00:23:17,00:23:18,We're on the same page.
413,00:23:18,00:23:20,Sweet talk never works on me.
414,00:23:20,00:23:21,I'm not so sweet.
415,00:23:21,00:23:24,"Oh, I like you."
416,00:23:29,00:23:31,You may approach the AFIS.
417,00:23:31,00:23:32,Thank you.
418,00:23:34,00:23:36,"STOKES: Matthew Lapaz, 22."
419,00:23:36,00:23:38,Juvie record starts at 16.
420,00:23:38,00:23:40,Priors for drug possession.
421,00:23:40,00:23:41,Work card for the Eclipse.
422,00:23:41,00:23:43,BRODY: Stopped working there three weeks ago.
423,00:23:43,00:23:47,"Guy had access to the hotel, that means he probably had access to the suites."
424,00:23:47,00:23:50,And we did find drug residue in the prince's suite...
425,00:23:50,00:23:52,"Maybe Lapaz was there, hooking him up."
426,00:23:52,00:23:54,More than just drugs.
427,00:23:54,00:23:56,So let's hook him up.
428,00:23:56,00:23:57,"So, Mr. Lapaz..."
429,00:23:57,00:23:59,you selling drugs to royalty now?
430,00:23:59,00:24:01,I don't sell drugs no more.
431,00:24:01,00:24:02,"What, did you move up to electronics?"
432,00:24:02,00:24:07,We found your prints on a hidden camera that was installed in a suite at the Eclipse.
433,00:24:07,00:24:10,"It was, uh... it was his suite."
434,00:24:11,00:24:13,"So, what, he hire you to make some home movies?"
435,00:24:13,00:24:15,Some sex tapes?
436,00:24:15,00:24:18,Or maybe you were in the prince's suite helping the maid set him up.
437,00:24:20,00:24:22,"Well... either way, Maria Garza's dead."
438,00:24:22,00:24:25,I don't know nothin'... about nothin'.
439,00:24:25,00:24:34,"Okay, we got guys going through your place right now, and with all those remote recordings you made with that lipstick cam, one of 'em's going to show Maria Garza's murder."
440,00:24:36,00:24:39,"Hey, listen to me."
441,00:24:39,00:24:41,Look at me.
442,00:24:41,00:24:43,This is your last chance to help yourself.
443,00:24:43,00:24:45,I'm gonna let my lawyer help me.
444,00:24:48,00:24:49,Hey. Thanks.
445,00:24:51,00:24:53,Did you find the two missing rounds from the guard's gun yet?
446,00:24:53,00:24:55,Nope.
447,00:24:55,00:24:57,I'm beginning to think they're in the next county.
448,00:24:57,00:24:58,Or in Vinnie Sapphire.
449,00:25:00,00:25:01,All right. Okay.
450,00:25:01,00:25:07,"The only blood out here is from the guard, who was shot in the face with a .44."
451,00:25:07,00:25:09,Two shooters inside had .38s.
452,00:25:09,00:25:14,Maybe whoever was driving Vinnie's getaway car was packing the .44.
453,00:25:14,00:25:16,Guard shot the car twice.
454,00:25:16,00:25:18,Okay. That's interesting.
455,00:25:18,00:25:21,Yeah. Do me a favor-- shoot me in the face.
456,00:25:21,00:25:24,(scoffs) What?
457,00:25:24,00:25:25,"Shoot me in the face-- pretend gun, you know."
458,00:25:25,00:25:27,"About a foot away, and don't miss."
459,00:25:27,00:25:28,You're the boss.
460,00:25:30,00:25:31,"Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!"
461,00:25:31,00:25:33,I wasn't even ready! (laughs)
462,00:25:33,00:25:34,That's the point.
463,00:25:34,00:25:36,We're done here. You can wrap it up.
464,00:25:36,00:25:38,Bullets aren't out here.
465,00:25:38,00:25:41,"And they're not in the next county, and they're not in Vinnie Sapphire, either."
466,00:25:41,00:25:42,Or in his car.
467,00:25:42,00:25:43,"Hey, thank you."
468,00:25:43,00:25:45,That was fun.
469,00:25:45,00:25:46,(scoffs)
470,00:25:46,00:25:49,BRODY: What's up?
471,00:25:49,00:25:52,Hey. You won't believe how organized Lapaz was.
472,00:25:52,00:25:58,"All the tapes from the prince's room have time and date stamps, so I went right to 3:00 a.m. the night of the murder..."
473,00:25:58,00:26:00,I get this.
474,00:26:00,00:26:03,They the hell is the camera focused on the night stand?
475,00:26:03,00:26:04,So much for a sex tape.
476,00:26:04,00:26:05,"Yeah, right?"
477,00:26:05,00:26:07,Let's keep going.
478,00:26:10,00:26:13,"STOKES: It's a safe tape, not a sex tape."
479,00:26:26,00:26:29,"My first year in L.A., I worked fraud cases."
480,00:26:29,00:26:31,I learned the difference between real and fake.
481,00:26:31,00:26:33,A Rolez and a Rolex. Mm-hmm.
482,00:26:33,00:26:36,"When I printed the prince, I noticed he had on a counterfeit watch."
483,00:26:36,00:26:38,I just thought he was cheap.
484,00:26:38,00:26:42,"So this wasn't about sex tapes or extortion, he was being robbed."
485,00:26:42,00:26:44,More like scammed.
486,00:26:44,00:26:47,Lapaz and Garza worked at the hotel together before they became partners in crime.
487,00:26:47,00:26:53,"They installed the camera to get the code from the safe, and then they swapped the prince's bling with counterfeit."
488,00:26:53,00:26:55,Who knows how many guests they've been ripping off?
489,00:26:55,00:26:58,"Yeah, well, I think I know one who got even."
490,00:26:58,00:26:59,"(loud, angry grunt)"
491,00:27:00,00:27:02,That's evidence.
492,00:27:02,00:27:04,And that was a lot of anger.
493,00:27:04,00:27:07,"Until this moment, I had no idea anyone has stolen anything from me."
494,00:27:07,00:27:11,"Even if I did, you really think I'd kill a maid over a watch?"
495,00:27:11,00:27:12,"Yes, I do."
496,00:27:12,00:27:18,"You know, we checked your key card logs from the penthouse suite-- you came back from the spa at 2:52 a.m."
497,00:27:18,00:27:22,That is four minutes after Maria Garza the maid entered to clean it.
498,00:27:22,00:27:26,So I came back to change before going to the casino.
499,00:27:26,00:27:28,"I was there for a minute, at most."
500,00:27:28,00:27:31,"The maid was in the suite, maybe she was in another room."
501,00:27:31,00:27:33,I did not see her.
502,00:27:33,00:27:34,I think you did.
503,00:27:36,00:27:41,"And I think you saw her hand in the cookie jar, did something about it."
504,00:27:41,00:27:43,What do you think you're doing?
505,00:27:43,00:27:46,"Uh, I was just checking to see that everything was okay."
506,00:27:46,00:27:48,Just checking what... (screaming)
507,00:27:53,00:27:54,(Garza shrieks)
508,00:28:01,00:28:03,I know you think I'm a pig...
509,00:28:06,00:28:08,that I treat those that serve me like dirt...
510,00:28:11,00:28:13,...but I'd never take a life.
511,00:28:13,00:28:16,And I'd never leave anyone like this.
512,00:28:20,00:28:21,Oh. Hey.
513,00:28:21,00:28:23,"Oh. Hey, boss."
514,00:28:23,00:28:25,"Got your results, and another story."
515,00:28:25,00:28:27,Let me go first this time.
516,00:28:27,00:28:33,So a museum security guard fires two shots from a .38 during an attempt on a mayor.
517,00:28:33,00:28:36,"That guard's found later, shot with a .44, outside in the alley."
518,00:28:36,00:28:41,"Now, the assumption is that he engaged the bad guys, but CSIs don't find any bullets outside."
519,00:28:41,00:28:46,But they do find two unaccounted-for .38 bullets inside.
520,00:28:46,00:28:47,Accounted for now.
521,00:28:47,00:28:48,Exactly.
522,00:28:48,00:28:52,So the .38s in the Gedda exhibit came from the guard's gun.
523,00:28:52,00:28:53,Nicely done!
524,00:28:53,00:28:55,I got there through ballistics.
525,00:28:55,00:28:56,How'd you get there?
526,00:28:56,00:28:58,"Uh, I shot Greg."
527,00:28:58,00:28:59,I-I gotta go. Sorry.
528,00:28:59,00:29:00,Thank you. That was great.
529,00:29:00,00:29:01,"Hey, Catherine! Catherine!"
530,00:29:04,00:29:12,"RUSSELL: So our security guard walks right up to the bad guy and lets himself get shot in the face without returning fire, right?"
531,00:29:12,00:29:16,"Now that tells me that he knew the shooter, and it also tells me he was probably in on it with Vinnie."
532,00:29:16,00:29:25,"Okay, so, while Vinnie was shooting the mayor from over there, the security guard got off two shots from here, at an upward angle."
533,00:29:25,00:29:30,The only thing he had a prayer of hitting was Gedda or the ceiling.
534,00:29:30,00:29:32,What was he aiming at? It wasn't the mayor.
535,00:29:32,00:29:33,"Well, maybe he hit what he was aiming at."
536,00:29:33,00:29:35,Gedda?
537,00:29:35,00:29:37,No... uh...
538,00:29:37,00:29:40,two shots would dice up all the safety glass.
539,00:29:40,00:29:44,I'm thinking maybe this whole thing was a two-fer.
540,00:29:44,00:29:47,"You know, shoot he mayor and shoot out the exhibit."
541,00:29:47,00:29:52,Could be Vinnie or the guard wanted something inside here.
542,00:29:52,00:29:55,WILLOWS: But what?
543,00:29:55,00:29:57,"Well, whatever it was..."
544,00:29:57,00:29:59,it was worth a guard's life.
545,00:30:03,00:30:05,STOKES: The prince has a point.
546,00:30:05,00:30:07,Why would he just leave Garza laying on the floor like that?
547,00:30:07,00:30:08,Seems too smart.
548,00:30:08,00:30:09,"Well, if not him, then who? Lapaz?"
549,00:30:09,00:30:11,He and Maria were partners in crime.
550,00:30:11,00:30:12,Maybe they had a falling out.
551,00:30:12,00:30:14,There's no sign of him at the hotel.
552,00:30:14,00:30:15,He's not on surveillance or anything.
553,00:30:15,00:30:17,Maybe we should take another look.
554,00:30:17,00:30:20,"Maybe somebody stuck around after the party, went after Maria."
555,00:30:33,00:30:34,Can you believe this guy?
556,00:30:34,00:30:37,He had his list of special requests put in writing.
557,00:30:37,00:30:39,"""Trash cans must be emptied on the half-hour."
558,00:30:39,00:30:42,"""Dirty glasses must be immediately removed from the room."
559,00:30:42,00:30:49,"Dirty linens and towels must be immediately replaced with new ones."" He wanted brand-new towels? Or clean ones?"
560,00:30:49,00:30:50,What's the difference?
561,00:30:50,00:30:55,Well... all the towels on the cart here are brand-new.
562,00:30:57,00:30:59,Grab me the ALS. I want to show you something.
563,00:31:05,00:31:08,These are towels from the crime scene...
564,00:31:08,00:31:13,and hotels put laundry marks on all their new linens after their first wash.
565,00:31:14,00:31:15,Let me see that.
566,00:31:20,00:31:22,STOKES: There it is-- you see that?
567,00:31:22,00:31:24,Hm!
568,00:31:24,00:31:27,So... towels from the crime scene had been washed.
569,00:31:27,00:31:29,They weren't brand-new.
570,00:31:29,00:31:35,"So, if these towels weren't from Maria's cart, where did they come from?"
571,00:31:35,00:31:39,"Ms. Vasquez, we checked the inventory from your cart the night Maria was killed."
572,00:31:39,00:31:42,You reported that you were four towels short.
573,00:31:42,00:31:43,Is that right?
574,00:31:43,00:31:44,People steal.
575,00:31:44,00:31:46,"Boy, don't I know it."
576,00:31:46,00:31:54,"So, tell me... was the safe hard to open, or did you, uh... did you get it on the first try?"
577,00:31:56,00:31:57,I haven't committed any crime.
578,00:31:57,00:31:58,"Oh, I beg to differ."
579,00:31:58,00:32:00,Check the key card lock.
580,00:32:00,00:32:01,I never went into the prince's suite.
581,00:32:01,00:32:04,We don't need to check the key card lock.
582,00:32:08,00:32:09,We searched your house.
583,00:32:09,00:32:11,I don't think any of that stuff belongs to you.
584,00:32:11,00:32:17,"STOKES: Eventually, we're going to match it back to all the guests that you and Matthew Lapaz have been ripping off."
585,00:32:17,00:32:19,Still don't think you've committed any crimes?
586,00:32:19,00:32:21,"How about burglary, fraud and murder?"
587,00:32:21,00:32:23,So...
588,00:32:23,00:32:25,why'd you kill Maria?
589,00:32:27,00:32:29,"Paula, you're going to prison."
590,00:32:31,00:32:35,A little truth might shave off a few years from the sentence.
591,00:32:42,00:32:43,The door was open.
592,00:32:46,00:32:49,I waited till Maria went into the other bedroom.
593,00:32:51,00:32:53,Then I went into the safe.
594,00:32:56,00:32:58,(speaking Spanish)
595,00:32:58,00:33:00,VASQUEZ: I told Maria we'd cut her in.
596,00:33:00,00:33:02,But she said that she was no thief.
597,00:33:02,00:33:06,She said that she was going to speak to the Head of Housekeeping.
598,00:33:06,00:33:07,STOKES: Go on.
599,00:33:07,00:33:09,Don't stop now. Tell us what happened.
600,00:33:12,00:33:14,No! (screams)
601,00:33:14,00:33:15,Get off of me!
602,00:33:17,00:33:18,(Garza shrieks)
603,00:33:23,00:33:27,I clean after people every day.
604,00:33:27,00:33:30,The rich-- they don't see me.
605,00:33:30,00:33:32,They don't thank me.
606,00:33:32,00:33:35,They only leave nothing but their garbage.
607,00:33:35,00:33:41,"The prince, with all his money, all his lawyers-- he has people to take care of him."
608,00:33:41,00:33:45,I have no one to take care of me.
609,00:33:45,00:33:49,I have to take care of myself.
610,00:33:50,00:33:51,What about Maria?
611,00:33:51,00:33:57,"You said her husband was out of work, that she was supporting her four kids."
612,00:33:57,00:33:59,Who's going to take care of them?
613,00:34:06,00:34:08,ECKLIE: The guard got himself killed over this?
614,00:34:08,00:34:10,An old journal?
615,00:34:10,00:34:12,The journal's the only thing missing from the Gedda exhibit.
616,00:34:12,00:34:15,A mobster who journals-- that's great for law enforcement.
617,00:34:15,00:34:17,"Well, it's mostly blank, except for the last two pages."
618,00:34:17,00:34:19,"Which aren't exactly ""Dear Diary"" entries."
619,00:34:19,00:34:21,"ECKLIE: Yeah, what are they? A to-do list."
620,00:34:21,00:34:26,"""Do,"" as in ""whack."" I assume a check means ""done""?"
621,00:34:26,00:34:28,Dead or presumed dead. Yeah.
622,00:34:28,00:34:34,"All right, so Vinnie Sapphire comes back to town, shoots Oscar Goodman to settle a score, and then steals Gedda's hit list. Why?"
623,00:34:34,00:34:35,He was Gedda's hit man.
624,00:34:35,00:34:37,He knows all their names.
625,00:34:37,00:34:38,All except the last one here.
626,00:34:38,00:34:41,Cesare Mastrantonio.
627,00:34:41,00:34:43,Yeah. No birth certificate. Guy never existed.
628,00:34:43,00:34:45,What's he doing on a hit list?
629,00:34:45,00:34:47,(phone ringing)
630,00:34:47,00:34:49,Yeah. Now what?
631,00:34:49,00:34:51,Yeah.
632,00:34:51,00:34:52,"Good work, Jim."
633,00:34:52,00:34:57,Brass found Vinnie Sapphire's car at a motel off Boulder Highway.
634,00:35:01,00:35:03,"Okay, back up."
635,00:35:11,00:35:13,"Oh, man."
636,00:35:14,00:35:17,"Hat on the bed, always bad luck."
637,00:35:19,00:35:20,"All clear, Catherine."
638,00:35:20,00:35:23,"I got a female DB, and it ain't Vinnie."
639,00:35:27,00:35:29,.44.
640,00:35:30,00:35:32,Same caliber as the security guard.
641,00:35:34,00:35:37,Here's why no one heard a shot.
642,00:35:37,00:35:41,This looks like the suit that was circling the museum in the Caddie.
643,00:35:41,00:35:43,I got an I.D.
644,00:35:43,00:35:45,Monique Roberts.
645,00:35:45,00:35:47,Monique Roberts?
646,00:35:47,00:35:51,I knew her. She was a friend of Sam's.
647,00:35:51,00:35:53,Friend of a lot of his friends.
648,00:35:53,00:35:56,"Well, if she was with Vinnie, maybe she was on the lam with him."
649,00:35:56,00:35:59,"And if that's her .44, maybe she was the getaway driver."
650,00:36:00,00:36:02,"Got something for me, baby? Always."
651,00:36:02,00:36:03,I got to get back inside.
652,00:36:03,00:36:05,Thanks for the memoirs.
653,00:36:06,00:36:09,"Well, Vinnie obviously wanted us chasing the wrong Vinnie-- the girl Vinnie."
654,00:36:09,00:36:12,"If we caught her, we wouldn't catch him."
655,00:36:12,00:36:14,"Well, he caught her for us."
656,00:36:14,00:36:16,"Well, looks like Vinnie left in a hurry."
657,00:36:16,00:36:20,"Left his suits, his car and his girlfriend."
658,00:36:20,00:36:21,Yeah. I don't see Gedda's journal.
659,00:36:21,00:36:22,"No journal, no Vinnie."
660,00:36:22,00:36:26,"Yeah, I'm getting a little sick and tired of this clown being two steps ahead of us."
661,00:36:36,00:36:38,These belong to you.
662,00:36:38,00:36:43,Understand you caught the person responsible for the housekeeper's murder.
663,00:36:43,00:36:44,That's right.
664,00:36:44,00:36:46,This...
665,00:36:46,00:36:48,"woman, Maria Garza."
666,00:36:51,00:36:53,She lost her life for this.
667,00:36:58,00:37:00,Someone with nothing gave everything...
668,00:37:00,00:37:03,for me.
669,00:37:08,00:37:10,Please give this to her family.
670,00:37:37,00:37:39,Greg!
671,00:37:42,00:37:44,Yeah. Hi.
672,00:37:44,00:37:48,So Cesare Mastrantonio-- he's on a hit list.
673,00:37:48,00:37:50,But he's never existed-- no birth certificate.
674,00:37:50,00:37:52,Right.
675,00:37:52,00:37:54,"So he never lived, but he's dead."
676,00:37:54,00:37:57,Did you check for a death certificate?
677,00:37:57,00:37:59,No. Why would we?
678,00:37:59,00:38:05,"Well, I'm just thinking that if he has one, maybe we can find out where he's buried, and then pay our respects."
679,00:38:07,00:38:08,SANDERS: Really?
680,00:38:08,00:38:11,You had to stop at the crematory flower shop?
681,00:38:11,00:38:12,They're for my wife.
682,00:38:12,00:38:14,Shouldn't we call Brass?
683,00:38:14,00:38:17,No. We're just a couple of mourners out for a nice stroll.
684,00:38:17,00:38:19,(glass shattering)
685,00:38:19,00:38:22,(woman whimpering)
686,00:38:22,00:38:24,(yelling and grunting)
687,00:38:30,00:38:32,(screaming sobs)
688,00:38:38,00:38:40,"Uh, Mrs. Sapphire?"
689,00:38:40,00:38:43,"Vinnie, that son of a bitch!"
690,00:38:43,00:38:44,(wailing sob)
691,00:38:44,00:38:46,"Okay, all right. Come on. Calm down."
692,00:38:46,00:38:48,Come on. Take a... just take some deep breaths.
693,00:38:48,00:38:50,Take some deep... He was always such a disappointment.
694,00:38:50,00:38:52,Okay. All right. Hold still.
695,00:38:52,00:38:55,You have a feather here.
696,00:38:55,00:38:56,Feel all right? Huh?
697,00:38:56,00:38:58,Do you... do you want Greg...
698,00:38:58,00:39:00,Greg to get you a glass of water or something?
699,00:39:02,00:39:05,I need something stiffer than a glass of water.
700,00:39:05,00:39:07,Okay. All right.
701,00:39:07,00:39:08,JOANNA: Get my purse.
702,00:39:08,00:39:11,RUSSELL: Get her purse for her.
703,00:39:15,00:39:18,(sighs)
704,00:39:18,00:39:20,Found your fingerprints in the motel.
705,00:39:20,00:39:22,GSR on your hands.
706,00:39:24,00:39:26,And a feather in your hair.
707,00:39:29,00:39:31,"Why did you kill her, Joanna?"
708,00:39:31,00:39:33,(sniffles)
709,00:39:37,00:39:40,"When Vinnie got pinched, he said, ""Don't worry."
710,00:39:40,00:39:46,"Oscar will get me off."" Well, that didn't happen."
711,00:39:46,00:39:49,"So when he ran, he said, ""Don't worry."
712,00:39:49,00:39:53,"There's plenty of money."" Yeah, there was."
713,00:39:53,00:40:00,"In his suitcase, next to him, on the lap of that bimbo as his Coupe de Ville flew the coop."
714,00:40:00,00:40:02,So you got her back.
715,00:40:02,00:40:03,"Did you get Vinnie back, too?"
716,00:40:03,00:40:05,No.
717,00:40:07,00:40:08,God whacked Vinnie.
718,00:40:08,00:40:14,"About five months ago, I get a call from this bimbo, Monique."
719,00:40:14,00:40:21,"Hadn't talked to the bitch in 20 years, but she calls me, and she says that Vinnie just died of cancer."
720,00:40:22,00:40:27,She tossed his body into Lake Mead because she couldn't afford a funeral.
721,00:40:27,00:40:28,She was broke.
722,00:40:28,00:40:30,"She figured I'd be broke, too."
723,00:40:30,00:40:33,So that's when I got into bed with the bitch.
724,00:40:34,00:40:41,"So, on his deathbed, Vinnie tells Monique, the... the mistress, all about Lou Gedda's stash of cash-- his rainy-day fund."
725,00:40:41,00:40:43,And tells her how to find it?
726,00:40:43,00:40:45,"Yeah, the last name on the hit list, right?"
727,00:40:45,00:40:51,"But, of course, that list has been buried in the police evidence vault for, like, years."
728,00:40:51,00:40:53,Until Oscar got it out of evidence and put it in the museum.
729,00:40:53,00:40:56,And it goes from being behind bars to being behind glass.
730,00:40:56,00:41:02,"So Joanna starts fishing around for an invite to the museum, while Monique starts coming on to the guard."
731,00:41:02,00:41:06,"And that poor guy, he had no idea that they were thinking about killing the mayor."
732,00:41:06,00:41:07,He was just in it for the money.
733,00:41:07,00:41:09,The wife told you all this at the mausoleum?
734,00:41:09,00:41:13,She was in a... pretty vulnerable state.
735,00:41:13,00:41:14,Why make the move on Oscar?
736,00:41:14,00:41:17,'Cause he ruined my marriage.
737,00:41:17,00:41:19,"You know, Vinnie was a good earner."
738,00:41:19,00:41:26,"If Oscar had taken the case, he'd have got Vinnie off, and he wouldn't have run off with his goomar."
739,00:41:27,00:41:31,So Oscar got what he deserved.
740,00:41:31,00:41:32,Almost.
741,00:41:32,00:41:37,"GOODMAN: And with that, I want everyone to take their glass, raise it high, and we'll say, ""Salud""!"
742,00:41:37,00:41:41,"(gunfire, people screaming)"
743,00:41:43,00:41:45,Damn suit.
744,00:41:45,00:41:51,ECKLIE: Did she happen to explain why Monique was running around wearing Vinnie's clothes?
745,00:41:51,00:41:53,Same reason why they got his car and gun out of mothballs.
746,00:41:53,00:41:54,They were setting him up.
747,00:41:54,00:42:00,"To quote the wife, ""The perfect fall guy is a dead guy."" I mean, that's brilliant."
748,00:42:00,00:42:03,"Well, we sure as hell fell for it."
749,00:42:03,00:42:05,So what happened to Gedda's stash of cash?
750,00:42:05,00:42:12,"Kind of hard to say, but the previous manager of the mortuary retired about five years ago to a villa in St. Barts."
751,00:42:12,00:42:14,So I'm thinking...
752,00:42:14,00:42:15,Mr. Mayor.
753,00:42:15,00:42:17,Yes.
754,00:42:17,00:42:18,Can I help you? I'm going to see my client.
755,00:42:18,00:42:20,Your client? Who's... who's that?
756,00:42:20,00:42:21,Joanna.
757,00:42:23,00:42:25,"But, Your Honor, she tried to kill you."
758,00:42:25,00:42:26,I know.
759,00:42:26,00:42:28,"Sir, she tried to kill you."
760,00:42:28,00:42:31,"I know, but she's entitled to a defense, isn't she?"
761,00:42:31,00:42:32,This is America.
762,00:42:36,00:42:39,"If I ever get in trouble, I want that guy defending me."
763,00:42:39,00:42:42,"If I ever get in trouble, I want his suit."
