0	00:00:21	00:00:23	Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
1	00:00:23	00:00:25	Mr. Mayor, over here!
2	00:00:28	00:00:36	The story of the Mob is the story of America Ellis Island to Brooklyn, Chicago, Kansas City...
3	00:00:36	00:00:39	finally, Vegas-- ticket to the American Dream.
4	00:00:39	00:00:42	Well, my great-grandfather came here from Wales.
5	00:00:42	00:00:43	He didn't become a gangster.
6	00:00:43	00:00:45	He drove a bread truck.
7	00:00:45	00:00:50	Huh. Weapons and personal items on loan from the Las Vegas Police Department.
8	00:00:50	00:00:52	That's one way to empty your evidence vault.
9	00:00:52	00:00:53	Yeah, don't get me started.
10	00:00:53	00:00:58	Mr. Mayor, you've taken heat from Italian-American groups accusing you of stereotyping.
11	00:00:58	00:00:59	Why not call it The Guido Museum?
12	00:00:59	00:01:00	Come on.
13	00:01:00	00:01:02	Mobsters come in all flavors.
14	00:01:02	00:01:06	You got Meyer Lansky, you got Bugsy Siegel, you got Moe, you got Moe, you got Moe.
15	00:01:06	00:01:08	They're really equal opportunity employers.
16	00:01:13	00:01:14	Congratulations.
17	00:01:14	00:01:16	Hmm?
18	00:01:16	00:01:18	Oscar put your dad in the Spilotro exhibit.
19	00:01:18	00:01:21	Forgot how handsome he was.
20	00:01:21	00:01:24	Goodfella's daughter turns CSI.
21	00:01:24	00:01:26	That's an amazing story.
22	00:01:26	00:01:29	No, Sam wasn't a goodfella.
23	00:01:29	00:01:31	No, he was a playfella.
24	00:01:31	00:01:34	When a goodfella wanted to party, Sam was the go-to guy.
25	00:01:34	00:01:38	He provided the women, the supplies, the favors, the security.
26	00:01:38	00:01:41	And those same goodfellas hired Sam to run their casinos.
27	00:01:41	00:01:45	He was connected, but no killer.
28	00:01:45	00:01:46	Nice spin, Greg.
29	00:01:46	00:01:54	Sam-- well, all these guys-- they were no angels, but family did come first, and they knew how to provide.
30	00:01:54	00:01:55	No kidding.
31	00:01:55	00:01:57	Sam gave her a casino.
32	00:01:57	00:02:00	I didn't even get the family wagon.
33	00:02:00	00:02:02	Are you here with your wife?
34	00:02:02	00:02:05	Uh, yeah, yeah, uh... my work wife.
35	00:02:05	00:02:06	Ecklie's over there.
36	00:02:06	00:02:07	Mm.
37	00:02:07	00:02:10	Hey, guys, look-- right there.
38	00:02:10	00:02:12	Why are we whispering?
39	00:02:12	00:02:15	Out of respect for the pack of Mob widows.
40	00:02:15	00:02:21	We got Mrs. Tony Revolvers Meli, Mrs. Vinnie Whack Job Sapphire and Mrs. Stu Greenbacks Greenberg...
41	00:02:21	00:02:22	together.
42	00:02:22	00:02:24	Unbelievable.
43	00:02:24	00:02:25	Why's that unbelievable?
44	00:02:25	00:02:27	Well, Whack Job was Lou Gedda's hitman.
45	00:02:27	00:02:32	He whacked Greenberg while he was at his own diamond anniversary and popped Meli while he was at the cardiologist.
46	00:02:32	00:02:34	And Whack Job?
47	00:02:34	00:02:35	Got arrested for all that whacking.
48	00:02:35	00:02:37	Jumped bail.
49	00:02:37	00:02:38	No one's seen him in 20 years.
50	00:02:38	00:02:41	Well, it's nice to see the wives have stayed in touch.
51	00:02:41	00:02:42	Yeah.
52	00:02:48	00:02:51	Not so comfortable being around all these Mobsters.
53	00:02:51	00:02:54	Like it or not, they're the founding fathers of Vegas.
54	00:02:59	00:03:00	Thank you, everybody, for coming here.
55	00:03:00	00:03:05	I've been waiting for this for ten years, the opening of the Mob Museum.
56	00:03:05	00:03:09	In particular, I want to thank our sheriff, Sheriff Liston. Thank you for your support.
57	00:03:09	00:03:14	You know, when I was running for mayor, the advice I got was, Don't talk about your past.
58	00:03:14	00:03:16	Don't talk about the wiseguys that you defended.
59	00:03:16	00:03:21	And I said, Bull, I'm gonna do it the way I want to do, and I got elected three times.
60	00:03:21	00:03:23	This museum's gonna be very special.
61	00:03:23	00:03:30	This is gonna tell the real story, the real story of Las Vegas and organized crime, warts and all.
62	00:03:30	00:03:35	So, with that, everybody raise your glass and we'll say, Salud!
63	00:03:44	00:03:46	Get the medics and secure the building!
64	00:03:48	00:03:52	Take these people into the lobby and get their statements.
65	00:03:54	00:03:56	An attempt on the life of the ex-Mayor.
66	00:03:56	00:03:57	My ass is hanging out here.
67	00:03:57	00:03:58	You better solve this quick.
68	00:03:58	00:04:01	Loud and clear, ma'am.
69	00:04:03	00:04:06	They just rolled the mayor into the ER.
70	00:04:06	00:04:07	Looks like he's gonna be okay.
71	00:04:07	00:04:09	Hit in a Mob museum?
72	00:04:09	00:04:10	It has to be a publicity stunt.
73	00:04:10	00:04:15	Sanders, if the former mayor was gonna stage his own assassination, I would've known about it.
74	00:04:15	00:04:17	And I think I would've told him no.
75	00:04:17	00:04:19	So I guess he got lucky tonight.
76	00:04:19	00:04:20	(phone ringing) Yeah, I'll say.
77	00:04:20	00:04:21	Ecklie.
78	00:04:21	00:04:23	Come here.
79	00:04:23	00:04:25	Well, how about the sheriff does the press conference this time?
80	00:04:25	00:04:29	Okay, I heard four shots fairly close by...
81	00:04:29	00:04:31	to the east of here.
82	00:04:40	00:04:41	Oh, there we go.
83	00:04:41	00:04:43	Do you have a...?
84	00:04:44	00:04:45	Uh, never mind.
85	00:04:45	00:04:46	Thank you.
86	00:04:50	00:04:52	.38 Colt revolver.
87	00:04:54	00:04:56	Four rounds fired.
88	00:04:56	00:04:57	Just like the real mobsters.
89	00:04:57	00:05:00	Dump your piece, then peace, out.
90	00:05:00	00:05:05	As Oscar was going down, I heard more shots coming from that direction.
91	00:05:05	00:05:08	Why don't you and I take a little walk?
92	00:05:08	00:05:09	Thank you very much.
93	00:05:09	00:05:12	Greg, uh, why don't you go get your kit?
94	00:05:12	00:05:15	Start processing from the podium out, all right?
95	00:05:18	00:05:20	Somebody shot Lou Gedda...
96	00:05:20	00:05:23	again.
97	00:05:23	00:05:26	Two bullets in him.
98	00:05:26	00:05:31	Glass broken on both sides.
99	00:05:35	00:05:38	I guess a shot or two could have gotten through.
100	00:05:40	00:05:42	Mayor was at the podium.
101	00:05:42	00:05:44	Not the best shot in the house.
102	00:05:44	00:05:45	But maybe the best cover.
103	00:05:46	00:05:48	Looks like a .38.
104	00:05:48	00:05:52	Okay, shots come from two different places.
105	00:05:52	00:05:53	Same caliber, same time.
106	00:05:53	00:05:55	Two shooters.
107	00:05:55	00:05:59	If the shooters left through the front door, somebody would've seen them.
108	00:06:13	00:06:17	Uh-oh.
109	00:06:17	00:06:18	Body.
110	00:06:21	00:06:22	Security guard.
111	00:06:30	00:06:33	Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special.
112	00:06:36	00:06:38	Got two shots off before he snorted a bullet.
113	00:06:43	00:06:46	Got a tire impression in water.
114	00:06:46	00:06:50	Better snap it before it dries.
115	00:06:55	00:06:57	Hold still.
116	00:06:57	00:07:02	What are you doing? Trust me, you're gonna want to remember the night they shot Oscar Goodman.
117	00:07:03	00:07:05	You look great.
118	00:07:42	00:07:45	The former mayor gets shot, and we're here.
119	00:07:45	00:07:47	What do you gotta do to pull the primo cases?
120	00:07:47	00:07:49	Well, if you ask me, they're all primo.
121	00:07:49	00:07:52	And hey, look at the bright side, you get to work with me.
122	00:07:52	00:07:53	That's the bright side?
123	00:07:53	00:07:54	Oh...
124	00:08:07	00:08:10	Somebody had a good time.
125	00:08:10	00:08:13	And somebody didn't.
126	00:08:13	00:08:15	It's Maria Garza.
127	00:08:15	00:08:16	She's the housekeeper for this suite.
128	00:08:16	00:08:20	If she were a bartender, I'd say someone didn't like their martini.
129	00:08:23	00:08:25	God, people are pigs.
130	00:08:25	00:08:27	So, Mrs. Garza works nights 00 a.m.
131	00:08:27	00:08:31	The Head of Housekeeping found her when she didn't show up for her union break.
132	00:08:31	00:08:34	94.1.
133	00:08:34	00:08:36	Been dead roughly three hours.
134	00:08:36	00:08:39	00 a.m.? Yeah.
135	00:08:39	00:08:40	Who's the suite registered to?
136	00:08:40	00:08:42	(phone ringing) Prince Jalal Najib.
137	00:08:42	00:08:43	Rapper?
138	00:08:43	00:08:45	East Coast or West Coast?
139	00:08:45	00:08:47	More, uh... Middle East.
140	00:08:47	00:08:50	Yeah. Brass. Go ahead. Okay.
141	00:08:50	00:08:51	Be right there.
142	00:08:51	00:08:53	Well, my prince awaits...
143	00:08:53	00:08:55	at the gaming table, of course.
144	00:08:55	00:08:57	So I'll practice my curtsey on the way to the elevator.
145	00:09:01	00:09:03	I'm guessing this is a first, Dave?
146	00:09:03	00:09:05	Definitely my first swizzle-stick.
147	00:09:05	00:09:07	Looks like the maid came in to clean up and got interrupted.
148	00:09:07	00:09:12	Yeah, check out the table... and the glasses.
149	00:09:12	00:09:14	Can't tell if that's from the party or the struggle.
150	00:09:14	00:09:18	Her skirt's hiked up.
151	00:09:18	00:09:20	Possible sexual assault.
152	00:09:21	00:09:23	Maybe she got jumped.
153	00:09:23	00:09:24	Tried to get away.
154	00:09:26	00:09:30	The last thing a prince needs is some hotel maid crying rape.
155	00:09:30	00:09:36	She tried to take off, and he just grabs the nearest weapon, and bam.
156	00:09:39	00:09:43	And then he just leaves her here, goes to the casino?
157	00:09:43	00:09:47	Maybe in his kingdom, he gets away with whatever he wants to, including murder.
158	00:10:01	00:10:02	Got a problem?
159	00:10:02	00:10:04	Yeah.
160	00:10:04	00:10:09	Found the bullet that shattered the mayor's martini glass.
161	00:10:09	00:10:11	But I haven't been able to find any other bullets.
162	00:10:11	00:10:14	Probably find them in the mayor, right?
163	00:10:14	00:10:16	Well, yeah, but then where's the blood?
164	00:10:16	00:10:18	If you get shot, you bleed.
165	00:10:18	00:10:20	That's a good point.
166	00:10:24	00:10:27	Okay, we know four shots came from my left.
167	00:10:27	00:10:31	First one takes out my martini.
168	00:10:31	00:10:34	Next three are direct hits.
169	00:10:42	00:10:45	You plan on staying down there for a while?
170	00:10:47	00:10:49	Can I see your flashlight for a sec?
171	00:10:55	00:10:57	Oh, yeah.
172	00:10:57	00:10:58	I'm sorry. Glove?
173	00:11:01	00:11:03	Thank you.
174	00:11:10	00:11:11	Mushroomed bullet.
175	00:11:11	00:11:13	There was no damage to the podium.
176	00:11:13	00:11:15	What else could it have hit?
177	00:11:15	00:11:17	Another good point.
178	00:11:17	00:11:20	Well, my obituary can wait.
179	00:11:20	00:11:21	I made the front page.
180	00:11:21	00:11:23	Both papers.
181	00:11:24	00:11:26	Get this in a department store, did you?
182	00:11:26	00:11:28	I wouldn't wear a store-made suit.
183	00:11:28	00:11:31	I got a tailor in Bogota. He's the greatest.
184	00:11:31	00:11:33	This is a bullet-proof suit.
185	00:11:33	00:11:35	Guess it comes with a lifetime guarantee?
186	00:11:35	00:11:38	Yeah. You get shot, and they fix it for free.
187	00:11:43	00:11:45	Is that one of the bullets?
188	00:11:45	00:11:47	Yeah. Looks like it.
189	00:11:50	00:11:53	I've never seen one of these before.
190	00:11:53	00:11:56	So who are you afraid of? I'm not afraid.
191	00:11:56	00:11:57	I'm just prepared.
192	00:11:57	00:12:01	Hell, I was the mayor for 12 years and you don't get everybody's vote.
193	00:12:01	00:12:04	And in my old life, I represented wiseguys who had legal trouble and couldn't get all of them off.
194	00:12:04	00:12:06	So you got a lot of enemies, do you?
195	00:12:06	00:12:09	Which is why I got to be bulletproof, baby.
196	00:12:09	00:12:10	And you got a lot of work to do.
197	00:12:25	00:12:26	Hi.
198	00:12:28	00:12:31	I'm CSI Brody.
199	00:12:31	00:12:32	Are you okay, ma'am?
200	00:12:32	00:12:36	No.
201	00:12:36	00:12:38	Maria was my friend.
202	00:12:38	00:12:41	We worked together for six years.
203	00:12:41	00:12:42	So you knew her well.
204	00:12:42	00:12:44	I'm sorry.
205	00:12:44	00:12:47	She was a good person.
206	00:12:47	00:12:49	A kind person.
207	00:12:49	00:12:52	Her husband lost his job.
208	00:12:52	00:12:56	She was supporting him and her four kids.
209	00:12:56	00:12:59	Were you working on this floor last night?
210	00:12:59	00:13:02	Yes. Here.
211	00:13:02	00:13:04	In this suite.
212	00:13:04	00:13:06	So, did you hear anything?
213	00:13:06	00:13:07	A scream, a fight?
214	00:13:07	00:13:11	No. It was too loud.
215	00:13:11	00:13:13	The party.
216	00:13:13	00:13:16	Did you see Maria go into the suite during the party?
217	00:13:19	00:13:20	Hey, it's okay.
218	00:13:20	00:13:22	Don't be afraid.
219	00:13:22	00:13:25	I just want to help Maria's family.
220	00:13:25	00:13:28	He was very demanding.
221	00:13:28	00:13:29	The prince.
222	00:13:29	00:13:33	He was here a lot.
223	00:13:33	00:13:35	Same suite.
224	00:13:35	00:13:37	He would always ask for Maria.
225	00:13:37	00:13:42	Some nights he would even call her ten, 20 times.
226	00:13:42	00:13:46	Did the prince ever make inappropriate demands of Maria?
227	00:13:46	00:13:48	She wouldn't say.
228	00:13:48	00:13:51	She never complained.
229	00:13:51	00:13:55	Like me, she was just happy to have a job.
230	00:14:39	00:14:43	Apparently, the prince was no prince when it came to demanding extra services from the maid.
231	00:14:43	00:14:45	You mean of a sexual variety?
232	00:14:45	00:14:47	Signs point that way.
233	00:14:47	00:14:49	So does this camera I just found.
234	00:14:49	00:14:51	It was pointed right at the bed.
235	00:14:51	00:14:53	Somebody's been taking home movies.
236	00:14:53	00:14:56	And it's rigged to transmit to a remote location.
237	00:14:56	00:14:59	I'll run the serial number.
238	00:14:59	00:15:01	See if I can get some prints off of it.
239	00:15:01	00:15:04	In the meantime, why don't you print His Majesty.
240	00:15:04	00:15:06	Find out what his deal is.
241	00:15:12	00:15:16	I hear I almost had our mayor on my table.
242	00:15:16	00:15:17	Sorry, Doc, not his time.
243	00:15:17	00:15:20	Don't be sorry; I voted for him three times.
244	00:15:20	00:15:22	Four, if you count his wife.
245	00:15:22	00:15:24	He's done great things for our town.
246	00:15:24	00:15:27	Oh, I agree. Mostly.
247	00:15:28	00:15:31	So I can guess C.O.D.-- gunshot wound to the nose.
248	00:15:31	00:15:33	Anything else interesting?
249	00:15:33	00:15:34	Yes.
250	00:15:36	00:15:41	Sooting, stippling, lead smoke around the entry point.
251	00:15:41	00:15:43	Shooter was less than a foot away.
252	00:15:43	00:15:44	So the guard almost caught him.
253	00:15:44	00:15:47	Well, he definitely caught a bullet.
254	00:15:47	00:15:49	A .38, I presume.
255	00:15:49	00:15:51	To match my growing collection.
256	00:15:54	00:15:55	Huh.
257	00:15:56	00:15:59	Your .38 put on some weight.
258	00:15:59	00:16:02	That looks like a .44.
259	00:16:04	00:16:06	Can't wait to tell Ecklie.
260	00:16:06	00:16:07	We've got three shooters.
261	00:16:13	00:16:15	So, Prince, do you know this woman?
262	00:16:15	00:16:17	No.
263	00:16:17	00:16:21	She's a maid at your hotel-- Maria Garza.
264	00:16:21	00:16:23	All those messes you made, she cleaned them up.
265	00:16:23	00:16:25	And?
266	00:16:25	00:16:26	And she's dead.
267	00:16:26	00:16:28	What's that got to do with me?
268	00:16:28	00:16:29	Her body was found in your suite.
269	00:16:29	00:16:31	Come on in.
270	00:16:31	00:16:33	You're talking about the hired help.
271	00:16:33	00:16:36	Hotel security told me about the little party you had last night.
272	00:16:36	00:16:40	00 a.m.
273	00:16:40	00:16:42	So where did you go for the after party?
274	00:16:42	00:16:43	The spa.
275	00:16:43	00:16:45	And from there, the casino.
276	00:16:45	00:16:47	Which is where you found me. Ready, Captain.
277	00:16:47	00:16:49	This is CSI Brody.
278	00:16:49	00:16:52	I'm hired to take your prints and DNA.
279	00:16:52	00:16:55	Didn't I see you at the Marquee Day Club yesterday?
280	00:16:56	00:16:58	Yeah... topless.
281	00:16:58	00:17:01	Remove your watch and jewelry.
282	00:17:01	00:17:04	Do you have a male assistant?
283	00:17:05	00:17:10	If it would make you feel more comfortable, I'll let you give me a thousand bucks when we're finished.
284	00:17:28	00:17:29	Open up.
285	00:17:31	00:17:33	I get paid by the hour.
286	00:17:42	00:17:44	Excuse me.
287	00:17:51	00:17:53	Word is you like stories.
288	00:17:53	00:17:55	I got a good one.
289	00:17:55	00:17:57	I'm on the edge of my seat.
290	00:17:57	00:18:01	.38 Colt dumped at the museum is definitely the gun that shot Oscar Goodman.
291	00:18:01	00:18:04	Ran the test fires through IBIS.
292	00:18:04	00:18:06	Gun's connected to seven prior shootings.
293	00:18:06	00:18:10	And here's your Mickey Spillane-- All seven date back to the '80s.
294	00:18:12	00:18:14	Wow.
295	00:18:14	00:18:16	Tough decade for Italian surnames.
296	00:18:16	00:18:18	Will you excuse me just a second?
297	00:18:18	00:18:19	Greg!
298	00:18:19	00:18:23	Tell me one more time, how do you pronounce your name?
299	00:18:23	00:18:24	Xiomara.
300	00:18:24	00:18:25	Xiomara.
301	00:18:25	00:18:27	What did I do?
302	00:18:27	00:18:29	Do you know any of these guys?
303	00:18:32	00:18:35	Know 'em? It's like a who's who of who's dead.
304	00:18:35	00:18:37	Joey Scarlatta sold Gedda his strip joint.
305	00:18:37	00:18:39	Capped the day the deal closed.
306	00:18:39	00:18:40	Vinnie The Moose Moosetti.
307	00:18:40	00:18:42	Gedda's mechanic.
308	00:18:42	00:18:43	Until the brakes were put on him.
309	00:18:43	00:18:46	Tommy Capicola Cappiletti. Butcher.
310	00:18:46	00:18:47	Gedda's ex-brother-in-law...
311	00:18:47	00:18:50	Yeah, I get it, I get it-- he was ex'd.
312	00:18:50	00:18:52	Right?
313	00:18:52	00:18:54	All seven shootings went cold.
314	00:18:54	00:18:57	Yeah, but that doesn't mean that everybody didn't know who did them.
315	00:18:57	00:19:00	It was Gedda's hit man Vinnie Sapphire.
316	00:19:00	00:19:02	All right, Tru Crime you know so much.
317	00:19:02	00:19:04	What's his last known?
318	00:19:04	00:19:05	Unknown.
319	00:19:05	00:19:07	Sapphire's been missing for the last 20 years.
320	00:19:07	00:19:08	Yeah, well, his wife's not.
321	00:19:11	00:19:13	I'll tell Brass. Bring her in.
322	00:19:13	00:19:14	Good work.
323	00:19:14	00:19:15	Now go away.
324	00:19:18	00:19:20	So, Brassy, what's with the sit-down?
325	00:19:20	00:19:21	You finally find Vinnie?
326	00:19:21	00:19:24	No, but we found his gun.
327	00:19:24	00:19:28	Oh. Well, he always liked 'em bright and shiny, just like his bimbos.
328	00:19:28	00:19:32	Well, this bright and shiny shot Oscar Goodman last night.
329	00:19:32	00:19:37	I'm thinking maybe Vinnie came home. Well, if he came home, he didn't come home to me.
330	00:19:37	00:19:42	But if there's anything that would bring Vinnie back from the dead, it's Oscar Goodman's Mob museum.
331	00:19:42	00:19:46	No induction for Vinnie, after all he did.
332	00:19:46	00:19:47	That is a crime.
333	00:19:47	00:19:50	And maybe motive to put a couple holes in the mayor.
334	00:19:50	00:19:52	But he had help.
335	00:19:52	00:19:55	Well, don't look at me. I like Oscar.
336	00:19:55	00:19:56	Yeah.
337	00:19:56	00:19:58	I contributed to his campaigns.
338	00:19:58	00:20:01	Now, Vinnie, he felt different.
339	00:20:01	00:20:03	And for good reason if you remember.
340	00:20:03	00:20:07	Oscar refused to rep him, even when Vinnie was facing the needle.
341	00:20:07	00:20:12	Gave him some BS excuse about looking for the good in his clients and not seeing any in Vinnie.
342	00:20:12	00:20:14	I mean, what kind of lawyer is that?
343	00:20:14	00:20:15	You're right.
344	00:20:15	00:20:18	Good guys don't need lawyers.
345	00:20:18	00:20:20	What about you?
346	00:20:20	00:20:23	Look, Vinnie bailed on me and our marriage after 20 years.
347	00:20:23	00:20:27	If he walked in this room right now, to stuff it.
348	00:20:30	00:20:31	I'll give you a tip.
349	00:20:31	00:20:43	If that bastard needed help with anything like taking out the mayor, you should do what Vinnie always did-- look for a new piece of ass.
350	00:20:43	00:20:46	I just never understood how Vinnie could leave you.
351	00:20:46	00:20:47	Well, that's because you're a gentleman.
352	00:20:49	00:20:51	Look, I got to get back to my crap job.
353	00:20:54	00:21:01	If you ever find yourself in the vicinity of Tom's Bar on Corvell, why don't you stop in?
354	00:21:01	00:21:05	I'll refill that bottle of whiskey you keep in your drawer.
355	00:21:13	00:21:15	Hodges. Hey.
356	00:21:15	00:21:18	I have a 1979 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.
357	00:21:18	00:21:20	They used one of these in the movie Goodfellas.
358	00:21:20	00:21:24	This one starred in circling the museum for about an hour last night.
359	00:21:24	00:21:25	Sam used to have one just like it.
360	00:21:25	00:21:28	I took my driving test in it. Couldn't fail.
361	00:21:28	00:21:30	I failed.
362	00:21:30	00:21:31	Twice.
363	00:21:31	00:21:33	Still get nightmares about all those cones.
364	00:21:33	00:21:38	So what about the tire impressions in the alley?
365	00:21:38	00:21:41	Well, here's where we enter the world of oddfellas.
366	00:21:41	00:21:43	Or, more precisely, Detroit.
367	00:21:43	00:21:46	Tire impressions were made by bias plies.
368	00:21:46	00:21:50	Same specs as you would find in factory tires on a '79 Caddy.
369	00:21:50	00:21:53	Bet you can't guess what kind of car Vinnie drove?
370	00:21:53	00:21:56	A '79 Cadillac Coupe De Ville.
371	00:21:56	00:22:00	I confirmed that with DMV.
372	00:22:00	00:22:01	And...
373	00:22:03	00:22:04	Plate's a match, too.
374	00:22:06	00:22:09	Vinnie's car, Vinnie's gun...
375	00:22:09	00:22:10	Vinnie's suit and hat.
376	00:22:10	00:22:12	Vinnie's back.
377	00:22:17	00:22:20	Maria Garza's autopsy showed showed no signs of vaginal trauma.
378	00:22:20	00:22:21	SAE kit was negative for semen.
379	00:22:21	00:22:24	Just because the prince couldn't close the deal, doesn't mean he didn't kill her.
380	00:22:24	00:22:25	That's true.
381	00:22:25	00:22:27	We're still processing his clothes.
382	00:22:27	00:22:29	Okay, well, I ran the serial number on the lipstick cam.
383	00:22:29	00:22:30	Came back to a store in Henderson.
384	00:22:30	00:22:32	Buyer paid cash.
385	00:22:32	00:22:34	I was able to pull some partials off of that.
386	00:22:34	00:22:37	Andy's running it right now.
387	00:22:37	00:22:38	My money's on the prince.
388	00:22:38	00:22:45	He gets one of his crew to install the camera, that way, whatever happens in Vegas doesn't have to stay in Vegas.
389	00:22:45	00:22:47	He can have movie night at the palace.
390	00:22:47	00:22:50	He really did piss you off, didn't he?
391	00:22:50	00:22:52	You know, there is another way to look at this.
392	00:22:52	00:22:56	That's a cheap consumer camera, access to the suite was easy.
393	00:22:56	00:22:58	You said Maria's husband was out of work.
394	00:22:58	00:23:00	She was supporting the family.
395	00:23:00	00:23:02	Maybe Maria saw an opportunity here.
396	00:23:02	00:23:05	Gives the prince even more motive.
397	00:23:05	00:23:06	It gives us more than that.
398	00:23:06	00:23:10	If that camera recorded the murder, we need to get our hands on that video footage.
399	00:23:12	00:23:13	You're hovering again.
400	00:23:13	00:23:16	Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
401	00:23:16	00:23:17	We both wore purple today.
402	00:23:17	00:23:18	We're on the same page.
403	00:23:18	00:23:20	Sweet talk never works on me.
404	00:23:20	00:23:21	I'm not so sweet.
405	00:23:21	00:23:24	Oh, I like you.
406	00:23:29	00:23:31	You may approach the AFIS.
407	00:23:31	00:23:32	Thank you.
408	00:23:34	00:23:36	Matthew Lapaz, 22.
409	00:23:36	00:23:38	Juvie record starts at 16.
410	00:23:38	00:23:40	Priors for drug possession.
411	00:23:40	00:23:41	Work card for the Eclipse.
412	00:23:41	00:23:43	Stopped working there three weeks ago.
413	00:23:43	00:23:47	Guy had access to the hotel, that means he probably had access to the suites.
414	00:23:47	00:23:50	And we did find drug residue in the prince's suite...
415	00:23:50	00:23:52	Maybe Lapaz was there, hooking him up.
416	00:23:52	00:23:54	More than just drugs.
417	00:23:54	00:23:56	So let's hook him up.
418	00:23:56	00:23:57	So, Mr. Lapaz...
419	00:23:57	00:23:59	you selling drugs to royalty now?
420	00:23:59	00:24:01	I don't sell drugs no more.
421	00:24:01	00:24:02	What, did you move up to electronics?
422	00:24:02	00:24:07	We found your prints on a hidden camera that was installed in a suite at the Eclipse.
423	00:24:07	00:24:10	It was, uh... it was his suite.
424	00:24:11	00:24:13	So, what, he hire you to make some home movies?
425	00:24:13	00:24:15	Some sex tapes?
426	00:24:15	00:24:18	Or maybe you were in the prince's suite helping the maid set him up.
427	00:24:20	00:24:22	Well... either way, Maria Garza's dead.
428	00:24:22	00:24:25	I don't know nothin'... about nothin'.
429	00:24:25	00:24:34	Okay, we got guys going through your place right now, and with all those remote recordings you made with that lipstick cam, one of 'em's going to show Maria Garza's murder.
430	00:24:36	00:24:39	Hey, listen to me.
431	00:24:39	00:24:41	Look at me.
432	00:24:41	00:24:43	This is your last chance to help yourself.
433	00:24:43	00:24:45	I'm gonna let my lawyer help me.
434	00:24:48	00:24:49	Hey. Thanks.
435	00:24:51	00:24:53	Did you find the two missing rounds from the guard's gun yet?
436	00:24:53	00:24:55	Nope.
437	00:24:55	00:24:57	I'm beginning to think they're in the next county.
438	00:24:57	00:24:58	Or in Vinnie Sapphire.
439	00:25:00	00:25:01	All right. Okay.
440	00:25:01	00:25:07	The only blood out here is from the guard, who was shot in the face with a .44.
441	00:25:07	00:25:09	Two shooters inside had .38s.
442	00:25:09	00:25:14	Maybe whoever was driving Vinnie's getaway car was packing the .44.
443	00:25:14	00:25:16	Guard shot the car twice.
444	00:25:16	00:25:18	Okay. That's interesting.
445	00:25:18	00:25:21	Yeah. Do me a favor-- shoot me in the face.
446	00:25:21	00:25:24	(scoffs) What?
447	00:25:24	00:25:25	Shoot me in the face-- pretend gun, you know.
448	00:25:25	00:25:27	About a foot away, and don't miss.
449	00:25:27	00:25:28	You're the boss.
450	00:25:30	00:25:31	Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
451	00:25:31	00:25:33	I wasn't even ready! (laughs)
452	00:25:33	00:25:34	That's the point.
453	00:25:34	00:25:36	We're done here. You can wrap it up.
454	00:25:36	00:25:38	Bullets aren't out here.
455	00:25:38	00:25:41	And they're not in the next county, and they're not in Vinnie Sapphire, either.
456	00:25:41	00:25:42	Or in his car.
457	00:25:42	00:25:43	Hey, thank you.
458	00:25:43	00:25:45	That was fun.
459	00:25:46	00:25:49	What's up?
460	00:25:49	00:25:52	Hey. You won't believe how organized Lapaz was.
461	00:25:52	00:25:58	All the tapes from the prince's room have time and date stamps, 00 a.m. the night of the murder...
462	00:25:58	00:26:00	I get this.
463	00:26:00	00:26:03	They the hell is the camera focused on the night stand?
464	00:26:03	00:26:04	So much for a sex tape.
465	00:26:04	00:26:05	Yeah, right?
466	00:26:05	00:26:07	Let's keep going.
467	00:26:10	00:26:13	It's a safe tape, not a sex tape.
468	00:26:26	00:26:29	My first year in L.A., I worked fraud cases.
469	00:26:29	00:26:31	I learned the difference between real and fake.
470	00:26:31	00:26:33	A Rolez and a Rolex. Mm-hmm.
471	00:26:33	00:26:36	When I printed the prince, I noticed he had on a counterfeit watch.
472	00:26:36	00:26:38	I just thought he was cheap.
473	00:26:38	00:26:42	So this wasn't about sex tapes or extortion, he was being robbed.
474	00:26:42	00:26:44	More like scammed.
475	00:26:44	00:26:47	Lapaz and Garza worked at the hotel together before they became partners in crime.
476	00:26:47	00:26:53	They installed the camera to get the code from the safe, and then they swapped the prince's bling with counterfeit.
477	00:26:53	00:26:55	Who knows how many guests they've been ripping off?
478	00:26:55	00:26:58	Yeah, well, I think I know one who got even.
479	00:27:00	00:27:02	That's evidence.
480	00:27:02	00:27:04	And that was a lot of anger.
481	00:27:04	00:27:07	Until this moment, I had no idea anyone has stolen anything from me.
482	00:27:07	00:27:11	Even if I did, you really think I'd kill a maid over a watch?
483	00:27:11	00:27:12	Yes, I do.
484	00:27:12	00:27:18	You know, we checked your key card logs from the penthouse suite-- 52 a.m.
485	00:27:18	00:27:22	That is four minutes after Maria Garza the maid entered to clean it.
486	00:27:22	00:27:26	So I came back to change before going to the casino.
487	00:27:26	00:27:28	I was there for a minute, at most.
488	00:27:28	00:27:31	The maid was in the suite, maybe she was in another room.
489	00:27:31	00:27:33	I did not see her.
490	00:27:33	00:27:34	I think you did.
491	00:27:36	00:27:41	And I think you saw her hand in the cookie jar, did something about it.
492	00:27:41	00:27:43	What do you think you're doing?
493	00:27:43	00:27:46	Uh, I was just checking to see that everything was okay.
494	00:27:46	00:27:48	Just checking what... (screaming)
495	00:28:01	00:28:03	I know you think I'm a pig...
496	00:28:06	00:28:08	that I treat those that serve me like dirt...
497	00:28:11	00:28:13	...but I'd never take a life.
498	00:28:13	00:28:16	And I'd never leave anyone like this.
499	00:28:20	00:28:21	Oh. Hey.
500	00:28:21	00:28:23	Oh. Hey, boss.
501	00:28:23	00:28:25	Got your results, and another story.
502	00:28:25	00:28:27	Let me go first this time.
503	00:28:27	00:28:33	So a museum security guard fires two shots from a .38 during an attempt on a mayor.
504	00:28:33	00:28:36	That guard's found later, shot with a .44, outside in the alley.
505	00:28:36	00:28:41	Now, the assumption is that he engaged the bad guys, but CSIs don't find any bullets outside.
506	00:28:41	00:28:46	But they do find two unaccounted-for .38 bullets inside.
507	00:28:46	00:28:47	Accounted for now.
508	00:28:47	00:28:48	Exactly.
509	00:28:48	00:28:52	So the .38s in the Gedda exhibit came from the guard's gun.
510	00:28:52	00:28:53	Nicely done!
511	00:28:53	00:28:55	I got there through ballistics.
512	00:28:55	00:28:56	How'd you get there?
513	00:28:56	00:28:58	Uh, I shot Greg.
514	00:28:58	00:28:59	I-I gotta go. Sorry.
515	00:28:59	00:29:00	Thank you. That was great.
516	00:29:00	00:29:01	Hey, Catherine! Catherine!
517	00:29:04	00:29:12	So our security guard walks right up to the bad guy and lets himself get shot in the face without returning fire, right?
518	00:29:12	00:29:16	Now that tells me that he knew the shooter, and it also tells me he was probably in on it with Vinnie.
519	00:29:16	00:29:25	Okay, so, while Vinnie was shooting the mayor from over there, the security guard got off two shots from here, at an upward angle.
520	00:29:25	00:29:30	The only thing he had a prayer of hitting was Gedda or the ceiling.
521	00:29:30	00:29:32	What was he aiming at? It wasn't the mayor.
522	00:29:32	00:29:33	Well, maybe he hit what he was aiming at.
523	00:29:33	00:29:35	Gedda?
524	00:29:35	00:29:37	No... uh...
525	00:29:37	00:29:40	two shots would dice up all the safety glass.
526	00:29:40	00:29:44	I'm thinking maybe this whole thing was a two-fer.
527	00:29:44	00:29:47	You know, shoot he mayor and shoot out the exhibit.
528	00:29:47	00:29:52	Could be Vinnie or the guard wanted something inside here.
529	00:29:52	00:29:55	But what?
530	00:29:55	00:29:57	Well, whatever it was...
531	00:29:57	00:29:59	it was worth a guard's life.
532	00:30:03	00:30:05	The prince has a point.
533	00:30:05	00:30:07	Why would he just leave Garza laying on the floor like that?
534	00:30:07	00:30:08	Seems too smart.
535	00:30:08	00:30:09	Well, if not him, then who? Lapaz?
536	00:30:09	00:30:11	He and Maria were partners in crime.
537	00:30:11	00:30:12	Maybe they had a falling out.
538	00:30:12	00:30:14	There's no sign of him at the hotel.
539	00:30:14	00:30:15	He's not on surveillance or anything.
540	00:30:15	00:30:17	Maybe we should take another look.
541	00:30:17	00:30:20	Maybe somebody stuck around after the party, went after Maria.
542	00:30:33	00:30:34	Can you believe this guy?
543	00:30:34	00:30:37	He had his list of special requests put in writing.
544	00:30:37	00:30:39	Trash cans must be emptied on the half-hour.
545	00:30:39	00:30:42	Dirty glasses must be immediately removed from the room.
546	00:30:42	00:30:46	Dirty linens and towels must be immediately replaced with new ones.
547	00:30:46	00:30:49	He wanted brand-new towels? Or clean ones?
548	00:30:49	00:30:50	What's the difference?
549	00:30:50	00:30:55	Well... all the towels on the cart here are brand-new.
550	00:30:57	00:30:59	Grab me the ALS. I want to show you something.
551	00:31:05	00:31:08	These are towels from the crime scene...
552	00:31:08	00:31:13	and hotels put laundry marks on all their new linens after their first wash.
553	00:31:14	00:31:15	Let me see that.
554	00:31:20	00:31:22	There it is-- you see that?
555	00:31:22	00:31:24	Hm!
556	00:31:24	00:31:27	So... towels from the crime scene had been washed.
557	00:31:27	00:31:29	They weren't brand-new.
558	00:31:29	00:31:35	So, if these towels weren't from Maria's cart, where did they come from?
559	00:31:35	00:31:39	Ms. Vasquez, we checked the inventory from your cart the night Maria was killed.
560	00:31:39	00:31:42	You reported that you were four towels short.
561	00:31:42	00:31:43	Is that right?
562	00:31:43	00:31:44	People steal.
563	00:31:44	00:31:46	Boy, don't I know it.
564	00:31:46	00:31:54	So, tell me... was the safe hard to open, or did you, uh... did you get it on the first try?
565	00:31:56	00:31:57	I haven't committed any crime.
566	00:31:57	00:31:58	Oh, I beg to differ.
567	00:31:58	00:32:00	Check the key card lock.
568	00:32:00	00:32:01	I never went into the prince's suite.
569	00:32:01	00:32:04	We don't need to check the key card lock.
570	00:32:08	00:32:09	We searched your house.
571	00:32:09	00:32:11	I don't think any of that stuff belongs to you.
572	00:32:11	00:32:17	Eventually, we're going to match it back to all the guests that you and Matthew Lapaz have been ripping off.
573	00:32:17	00:32:19	Still don't think you've committed any crimes?
574	00:32:19	00:32:21	How about burglary, fraud and murder?
575	00:32:21	00:32:23	So...
576	00:32:23	00:32:25	why'd you kill Maria?
577	00:32:27	00:32:29	Paula, you're going to prison.
578	00:32:31	00:32:35	A little truth might shave off a few years from the sentence.
579	00:32:42	00:32:43	The door was open.
580	00:32:46	00:32:49	I waited till Maria went into the other bedroom.
581	00:32:51	00:32:53	Then I went into the safe.
582	00:32:58	00:33:00	I told Maria we'd cut her in.
583	00:33:00	00:33:02	But she said that she was no thief.
584	00:33:02	00:33:06	She said that she was going to speak to the Head of Housekeeping.
585	00:33:06	00:33:07	Go on.
586	00:33:07	00:33:09	Don't stop now. Tell us what happened.
587	00:33:12	00:33:14	No! (screams)
588	00:33:14	00:33:15	Get off of me!
589	00:33:23	00:33:27	I clean after people every day.
590	00:33:27	00:33:30	The rich-- they don't see me.
591	00:33:30	00:33:32	They don't thank me.
592	00:33:32	00:33:35	They only leave nothing but their garbage.
593	00:33:35	00:33:41	The prince, with all his money, all his lawyers-- he has people to take care of him.
594	00:33:41	00:33:45	I have no one to take care of me.
595	00:33:45	00:33:49	I have to take care of myself.
596	00:33:50	00:33:51	What about Maria?
597	00:33:51	00:33:57	You said her husband was out of work, that she was supporting her four kids.
598	00:33:57	00:33:59	Who's going to take care of them?
599	00:34:06	00:34:08	The guard got himself killed over this?
600	00:34:08	00:34:10	An old journal?
601	00:34:10	00:34:12	The journal's the only thing missing from the Gedda exhibit.
602	00:34:12	00:34:15	A mobster who journals-- that's great for law enforcement.
603	00:34:15	00:34:17	Well, it's mostly blank, except for the last two pages.
604	00:34:17	00:34:19	Which aren't exactly Dear Diary entries.
605	00:34:19	00:34:21	Yeah, what are they? A to-do list.
606	00:34:21	00:34:24	Do, as in whack.
607	00:34:24	00:34:26	I assume a check means done?
608	00:34:26	00:34:28	Dead or presumed dead. Yeah.
609	00:34:28	00:34:34	All right, so Vinnie Sapphire comes back to town, shoots Oscar Goodman to settle a score, and then steals Gedda's hit list. Why?
610	00:34:34	00:34:35	He was Gedda's hit man.
611	00:34:35	00:34:37	He knows all their names.
612	00:34:37	00:34:38	All except the last one here.
613	00:34:38	00:34:41	Cesare Mastrantonio.
614	00:34:41	00:34:43	Yeah. No birth certificate. Guy never existed.
615	00:34:43	00:34:45	What's he doing on a hit list?
616	00:34:47	00:34:49	Yeah. Now what?
617	00:34:49	00:34:51	Yeah.
618	00:34:51	00:34:52	Good work, Jim.
619	00:34:52	00:34:57	Brass found Vinnie Sapphire's car at a motel off Boulder Highway.
620	00:35:01	00:35:03	Okay, back up.
621	00:35:11	00:35:13	Oh, man.
622	00:35:14	00:35:17	Hat on the bed, always bad luck.
623	00:35:19	00:35:20	All clear, Catherine.
624	00:35:20	00:35:23	I got a female DB, and it ain't Vinnie.
625	00:35:27	00:35:29	.44.
626	00:35:30	00:35:32	Same caliber as the security guard.
627	00:35:34	00:35:37	Here's why no one heard a shot.
628	00:35:37	00:35:41	This looks like the suit that was circling the museum in the Caddie.
629	00:35:41	00:35:43	I got an I.D.
630	00:35:43	00:35:45	Monique Roberts.
631	00:35:45	00:35:47	Monique Roberts?
632	00:35:47	00:35:51	I knew her. She was a friend of Sam's.
633	00:35:51	00:35:53	Friend of a lot of his friends.
634	00:35:53	00:35:56	Well, if she was with Vinnie, maybe she was on the lam with him.
635	00:35:56	00:35:59	And if that's her .44, maybe she was the getaway driver.
636	00:36:00	00:36:02	Got something for me, baby? Always.
637	00:36:02	00:36:03	I got to get back inside.
638	00:36:03	00:36:05	Thanks for the memoirs.
639	00:36:06	00:36:09	Well, Vinnie obviously wanted us chasing the wrong Vinnie-- the girl Vinnie.
640	00:36:09	00:36:12	If we caught her, we wouldn't catch him.
641	00:36:12	00:36:14	Well, he caught her for us.
642	00:36:14	00:36:16	Well, looks like Vinnie left in a hurry.
643	00:36:16	00:36:20	Left his suits, his car and his girlfriend.
644	00:36:20	00:36:21	Yeah. I don't see Gedda's journal.
645	00:36:21	00:36:22	No journal, no Vinnie.
646	00:36:22	00:36:26	Yeah, I'm getting a little sick and tired of this clown being two steps ahead of us.
647	00:36:36	00:36:38	These belong to you.
648	00:36:38	00:36:43	Understand you caught the person responsible for the housekeeper's murder.
649	00:36:43	00:36:44	That's right.
650	00:36:44	00:36:46	This...
651	00:36:46	00:36:48	woman, Maria Garza.
652	00:36:51	00:36:53	She lost her life for this.
653	00:36:58	00:37:00	Someone with nothing gave everything...
654	00:37:00	00:37:03	for me.
655	00:37:08	00:37:10	Please give this to her family.
656	00:37:37	00:37:39	Greg!
657	00:37:42	00:37:44	Yeah. Hi.
658	00:37:44	00:37:48	So Cesare Mastrantonio-- he's on a hit list.
659	00:37:48	00:37:50	But he's never existed-- no birth certificate.
660	00:37:50	00:37:52	Right.
661	00:37:52	00:37:54	So he never lived, but he's dead.
662	00:37:54	00:37:57	Did you check for a death certificate?
663	00:37:57	00:37:59	No. Why would we?
664	00:37:59	00:38:05	Well, I'm just thinking that if he has one, maybe we can find out where he's buried, and then pay our respects.
665	00:38:07	00:38:08	Really?
666	00:38:08	00:38:11	You had to stop at the crematory flower shop?
667	00:38:11	00:38:12	They're for my wife.
668	00:38:12	00:38:14	Shouldn't we call Brass?
669	00:38:14	00:38:17	No. We're just a couple of mourners out for a nice stroll.
670	00:38:38	00:38:40	Uh, Mrs. Sapphire?
671	00:38:40	00:38:43	Vinnie, that son of a bitch!
672	00:38:44	00:38:46	Okay, all right. Come on. Calm down.
673	00:38:46	00:38:48	Come on. Take a... just take some deep breaths.
674	00:38:48	00:38:50	Take some deep... He was always such a disappointment.
675	00:38:50	00:38:52	Okay. All right. Hold still.
676	00:38:52	00:38:55	You have a feather here.
677	00:38:55	00:38:56	Feel all right? Huh?
678	00:38:56	00:38:58	Do you... do you want Greg...
679	00:38:58	00:39:00	Greg to get you a glass of water or something?
680	00:39:02	00:39:05	I need something stiffer than a glass of water.
681	00:39:05	00:39:07	Okay. All right.
682	00:39:07	00:39:08	Get my purse.
683	00:39:08	00:39:11	Get her purse for her.
684	00:39:18	00:39:20	Found your fingerprints in the motel.
685	00:39:20	00:39:22	GSR on your hands.
686	00:39:24	00:39:26	And a feather in your hair.
687	00:39:29	00:39:31	Why did you kill her, Joanna?
688	00:39:37	00:39:40	When Vinnie got pinched, he said, Don't worry.
689	00:39:40	00:39:43	Oscar will get me off.
690	00:39:43	00:39:46	Well, that didn't happen.
691	00:39:46	00:39:49	So when he ran, he said, Don't worry.
692	00:39:49	00:39:51	There's plenty of money.
693	00:39:51	00:39:53	Yeah, there was.
694	00:39:53	00:40:00	In his suitcase, next to him, on the lap of that bimbo as his Coupe de Ville flew the coop.
695	00:40:00	00:40:02	So you got her back.
696	00:40:02	00:40:03	Did you get Vinnie back, too?
697	00:40:03	00:40:05	No.
698	00:40:07	00:40:08	God whacked Vinnie.
699	00:40:08	00:40:14	About five months ago, I get a call from this bimbo, Monique.
700	00:40:14	00:40:21	Hadn't talked to the bitch in 20 years, but she calls me, and she says that Vinnie just died of cancer.
701	00:40:22	00:40:27	She tossed his body into Lake Mead because she couldn't afford a funeral.
702	00:40:27	00:40:28	She was broke.
703	00:40:28	00:40:30	She figured I'd be broke, too.
704	00:40:30	00:40:33	So that's when I got into bed with the bitch.
705	00:40:34	00:40:41	So, on his deathbed, Vinnie tells Monique, the... the mistress, all about Lou Gedda's stash of cash-- his rainy-day fund.
706	00:40:41	00:40:43	And tells her how to find it?
707	00:40:43	00:40:45	Yeah, the last name on the hit list, right?
708	00:40:45	00:40:51	But, of course, that list has been buried in the police evidence vault for, like, years.
709	00:40:51	00:40:53	Until Oscar got it out of evidence and put it in the museum.
710	00:40:53	00:40:56	And it goes from being behind bars to being behind glass.
711	00:40:56	00:41:02	So Joanna starts fishing around for an invite to the museum, while Monique starts coming on to the guard.
712	00:41:02	00:41:06	And that poor guy, he had no idea that they were thinking about killing the mayor.
713	00:41:06	00:41:07	He was just in it for the money.
714	00:41:07	00:41:09	The wife told you all this at the mausoleum?
715	00:41:09	00:41:13	She was in a... pretty vulnerable state.
716	00:41:13	00:41:14	Why make the move on Oscar?
717	00:41:14	00:41:17	'Cause he ruined my marriage.
718	00:41:17	00:41:19	You know, Vinnie was a good earner.
719	00:41:19	00:41:26	If Oscar had taken the case, he'd have got Vinnie off, and he wouldn't have run off with his goomar.
720	00:41:27	00:41:31	So Oscar got what he deserved.
721	00:41:31	00:41:32	Almost.
722	00:41:32	00:41:37	And with that, I want everyone to take their glass, raise it high, and we'll say, Salud!
723	00:41:43	00:41:45	Damn suit.
724	00:41:45	00:41:51	Did she happen to explain why Monique was running around wearing Vinnie's clothes?
725	00:41:51	00:41:53	Same reason why they got his car and gun out of mothballs.
726	00:41:53	00:41:54	They were setting him up.
727	00:41:54	00:41:58	To quote the wife, The perfect fall guy is a dead guy.
728	00:41:58	00:42:00	I mean, that's brilliant.
729	00:42:00	00:42:03	Well, we sure as hell fell for it.
730	00:42:03	00:42:05	So what happened to Gedda's stash of cash?
731	00:42:05	00:42:12	Kind of hard to say, but the previous manager of the mortuary retired about five years ago to a villa in St. Barts.
732	00:42:12	00:42:14	So I'm thinking...
733	00:42:14	00:42:15	Mr. Mayor.
734	00:42:15	00:42:17	Yes.
735	00:42:17	00:42:18	Can I help you? I'm going to see my client.
736	00:42:18	00:42:20	Your client? Who's... who's that?
737	00:42:20	00:42:21	Joanna.
738	00:42:23	00:42:25	But, Your Honor, she tried to kill you.
739	00:42:25	00:42:26	I know.
740	00:42:26	00:42:28	Sir, she tried to kill you.
741	00:42:28	00:42:31	I know, but she's entitled to a defense, isn't she?
742	00:42:31	00:42:32	This is America.
743	00:42:36	00:42:39	If I ever get in trouble, I want that guy defending me.
744	00:42:39	00:42:42	If I ever get in trouble, I want his suit.
