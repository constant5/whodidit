0	00:00:36	00:00:38	Hey. What are you doing here?
1	00:00:38	00:00:41	I work here... close to 20 years now.
2	00:00:41	00:00:43	You're two and a half hours early.
3	00:00:43	00:00:46	My house is too quiet, if that makes any sense.
4	00:00:46	00:00:48	Oh, no, it makes complete sense.
5	00:00:48	00:00:54	Yeah, our youngest has been out of the house now for three months, and we're still wrestling with empty nest.
6	00:00:54	00:00:55	Yeah.
7	00:00:55	00:00:57	So how is your daughter?
8	00:00:57	00:00:58	Lindsey.
9	00:00:58	00:00:59	Lindsey, yeah. Yeah.
10	00:00:59	00:01:01	Uh, she's doing... she's doing really good.
11	00:01:01	00:01:02	She's doing great, in fact.
12	00:01:02	00:01:04	She's... well, according to her e-mails.
13	00:01:04	00:01:08	Hey, do you do that thing where you call them, and then you get this three-word text back?
14	00:01:08	00:01:11	Doesn't it make you crazy?
15	00:01:11	00:01:12	Yes, but, um...
16	00:01:13	00:01:16	...this is her time to find herself, you know?
17	00:01:19	00:01:20	Okay.
18	00:01:20	00:01:21	You're on the clock now.
19	00:01:27	00:01:31	So, neighbor called in shots fired.
20	00:01:31	00:01:33	Police officers found the door ajar.
21	00:01:33	00:01:34	No sign of forced entry.
22	00:01:38	00:01:41	Place belongs to Michael Newbury.
23	00:01:41	00:01:43	Army Ranger, military lifer.
24	00:01:43	00:01:45	Retired out here 15 years ago.
25	00:01:45	00:01:47	Hmm. Married to the mission.
26	00:01:47	00:01:51	Not a woman's touch.
27	00:01:51	00:01:53	No photos, no family.
28	00:01:54	00:01:57	Yeah, talk about empty nest.
29	00:02:01	00:02:03	Okay. I give up.
30	00:02:03	00:02:05	Where's the body?
31	00:02:05	00:02:06	Well, there's none to speak of.
32	00:02:06	00:02:11	We found blood and evidence of those shots fired.
33	00:02:11	00:02:12	Lots of evidence.
34	00:02:14	00:02:16	Do you recognize this caliber?
35	00:02:16	00:02:19	Five-point-seven by 28?
36	00:02:19	00:02:21	Never seen it before. Yeah.
37	00:02:21	00:02:23	Neither have I.
38	00:02:26	00:02:28	Casings have rolled all over the floor.
39	00:02:28	00:02:33	Kind of hard to tell where the shooter was.
40	00:02:33	00:02:36	Easy to place the shots, though.
41	00:02:37	00:02:43	Okay, so, our guy was probably standing here, got shot, right?
42	00:02:43	00:02:46	Spatter starts to thin out.
43	00:02:46	00:02:49	Drops the beer bottle.
44	00:02:49	00:02:52	Collapses in this direction.
45	00:02:52	00:02:54	And then...
46	00:02:54	00:02:56	Nothing.
47	00:02:56	00:02:58	No body, no suspect, no murder weapon.
48	00:03:03	00:03:06	Furniture moving disks.
49	00:03:06	00:03:08	Check out the scuffing along the floor.
50	00:03:08	00:03:10	Repetitive.
51	00:03:10	00:03:12	Let's move it.
52	00:03:17	00:03:19	Okay.
53	00:03:25	00:03:27	You guys should check this out!
54	00:03:35	00:03:38	No body, no suspects.
55	00:03:38	00:03:40	But if you're in the market for a murder weapon...
56	00:03:42	00:03:43	...take your pick.
57	00:04:20	00:04:22	So, I just finished talking to all the neighbors over there.
58	00:04:22	00:04:23	They all said the same thing.
59	00:04:23	00:04:25	Kept to himself?
60	00:04:25	00:04:27	By all accounts, a hermit.
61	00:04:27	00:04:30	Anybody float any theories on why someone would want to hurt him?
62	00:04:30	00:04:34	No, and apparently, he had no friends and no enemies.
63	00:04:34	00:04:38	But one of the neighbors called him a, quote, a peaceful soul.
64	00:04:38	00:04:40	Yeah, I'm betting they hadn't seen that gun room.
65	00:04:41	00:04:43	Greg.
66	00:04:43	00:04:44	Let me show you something.
67	00:04:47	00:04:52	When the sun came up-- thank you-- the unis found a secondary scene.
68	00:04:52	00:04:54	Take a look at it, will you, and tell me what you see?
69	00:04:54	00:04:58	Well, I see lots of cartridge casings.
70	00:04:58	00:04:59	Where are the bullet holes?
71	00:04:59	00:05:04	In the ground, by way of a body, I'm thinking.
72	00:05:04	00:05:07	Take a look at that jelly that's kind of jammed in there.
73	00:05:07	00:05:09	Looks like human flesh, right?
74	00:05:09	00:05:11	Looks like it.
75	00:05:11	00:05:13	Bone fragments, intestinal tissue.
76	00:05:13	00:05:16	Take a look at the tissue a little closer.
77	00:05:18	00:05:20	Margins aren't inflamed.
78	00:05:20	00:05:22	Capillaries are withdrawn.
79	00:05:22	00:05:25	Tells me that this victim's heart stopped beating before all this damage was done.
80	00:05:25	00:05:29	But why would you shoot a dead man a hundred times?
81	00:05:30	00:05:32	I don't know...
82	00:05:32	00:05:35	but maybe this has something to do with it.
83	00:05:35	00:05:38	Looks like a grommet or something, right?
84	00:05:38	00:05:39	Shower curtain?
85	00:06:10	00:06:12	Which one of these is for OCD?
86	00:06:14	00:06:16	Hey, check this out.
87	00:06:19	00:06:21	Oh. Looks Arabic.
88	00:06:21	00:06:23	That's all I got.
89	00:06:23	00:06:24	Took Spanish in high school.
90	00:06:24	00:06:26	Moi, Francais.
91	00:06:26	00:06:30	But fortunately... there's an app for that.
92	00:06:30	00:06:31	Of course there is.
93	00:06:34	00:06:36	Farsi.
94	00:06:36	00:06:40	Ex-military, a loner, a room full of guns.
95	00:06:40	00:06:43	And medication from the Middle East.
96	00:06:43	00:06:44	Who the hell was this guy?
97	00:06:49	00:06:52	Whew.
98	00:06:52	00:06:55	Well, leave it up to you to find the books in a room full of guns.
99	00:06:55	00:06:57	Let me ask you something.
100	00:06:57	00:06:59	What do you have on your bookshelves at home?
101	00:06:59	00:07:08	Uh, Sports Illustrated, MoneyBall, bunch of forensics books-- But all in all, like, a good representation of who you are, right?
102	00:07:08	00:07:11	Man, fan, CSI.
103	00:07:11	00:07:13	So, what's on this guy's reading list?
104	00:07:13	00:07:15	Great American Manifestoes?
105	00:07:15	00:07:16	No, that's the interesting thing.
106	00:07:16	00:07:21	I mean, he's got Journal of Ballistics, Hatcher's Notebook, Firearms Assembly, Part Three.
107	00:07:21	00:07:25	He's even got a classical mechanics text.
108	00:07:25	00:07:27	So, he's a nerdy gun nut.
109	00:07:27	00:07:30	Yeah, I think he's more like a scientist, like us.
110	00:07:30	00:07:32	I mean, look at this workspace.
111	00:07:32	00:07:33	You could eat off this sucker.
112	00:07:33	00:07:35	Everything in its place.
113	00:07:35	00:07:37	Oh, come here. This is so cool.
114	00:07:37	00:07:41	All his guns are organized by theater of conflict, you know?
115	00:07:41	00:07:45	World War II Europe all the way to the surge in Afghanistan.
116	00:07:45	00:07:46	Cool, huh?
117	00:07:46	00:07:48	Yeah, the coolest, but we need info on a more current conflict.
118	00:07:48	00:07:56	The shooting up in the kitchen. Which is why I called in the big gun. Hey, Xiomara, welcome to Xanadu.
119	00:07:56	00:07:58	Wow.
120	00:07:58	00:08:01	This is so much like my dreams, it's scary.
121	00:08:01	00:08:04	Yeah, let me ask you something before I completely lose you here.
122	00:08:04	00:08:06	You recognize that caliber?
123	00:08:06	00:08:10	Five-point-seven by 28 mil. Rare.
124	00:08:10	00:08:12	Can't even buy these rounds in the States.
125	00:08:12	00:08:13	Oh, you can fire plenty.
126	00:08:13	00:08:16	Someone put seven in our victim.
127	00:08:16	00:08:20	So, you think any of these could be the culprit?
128	00:08:20	00:08:29	Hmm... Well, as much as I'd love to fire that Italian 38 Troopen Special, or even just touch that million dollar Luger...
129	00:08:29	00:08:30	Geez.
130	00:08:30	00:08:32	Get a room. Oh, I got one.
131	00:08:32	00:08:34	And it's perfect.
132	00:08:34	00:08:37	The only problem is, none of these guns in here use that caliber.
133	00:08:37	00:08:39	Oh, it's crazy.
134	00:08:39	00:08:41	All this firepower, and still no murder weapon.
135	00:08:44	00:08:46	Catherine, who do you want to be?
136	00:08:46	00:08:47	Victim or killer?
137	00:08:47	00:08:49	I'll be the killer.
138	00:08:49	00:08:57	I'll be the victim. I've got a beer in my hand, I'm standing in my own kitchen, I've got every kind of gun six meters that way.
139	00:08:57	00:09:00	I'm heading that way when I'm shot.
140	00:09:00	00:09:04	These laser trajectories are too low.
141	00:09:11	00:09:13	Thought the killer surprised him.
142	00:09:13	00:09:18	The lasers tell us that he was well inside before he fired.
143	00:09:21	00:09:24	Killer was sitting at the counter.
144	00:09:24	00:09:26	Newbury welcomed him into his home.
145	00:09:28	00:09:30	Maybe they both had a beer together.
146	00:09:43	00:09:44	So, he was killed by somebody he knew.
147	00:09:46	00:09:50	Well, our victim's paper trail is pretty straightforward.
148	00:09:50	00:09:51	Ex-Army.
149	00:09:51	00:09:54	Bought his little piece of heaven in 1997.
150	00:09:54	00:09:56	Lived there peacefully ever since.
151	00:09:56	00:10:01	Never married, never arrested, and never out of the country except for Gulf War I.
152	00:10:01	00:10:02	I think you're wrong on that.
153	00:10:02	00:10:04	I'm sorry?
154	00:10:04	00:10:05	Oh, don't be sorry. Just be wrong.
155	00:10:05	00:10:13	I ran your Farsi label. It's, uh, Hexadecylphosphocholine, which is the drug of choice for the Kala Azar parasite.
156	00:10:13	00:10:20	This particular little bugger resides exclusively in the Middle East. How do you get a Middle Eastern parasite in Mountain Springs?
157	00:10:20	00:10:22	You don't.
158	00:10:22	00:10:24	It seems our evidence trails contradict each other.
159	00:10:24	00:10:26	Which brings us back to you being wrong.
160	00:10:26	00:10:28	Hey, why am I the one who's wrong?
161	00:10:28	00:10:30	Because the other person is me.
162	00:10:30	00:10:33	Okay, well, tell you what.
163	00:10:33	00:10:36	Hair never lies, so, let's let it decide.
164	00:11:04	00:11:07	So the bullets in the kitchen and the bullets in the ground out by the barn...
165	00:11:07	00:11:09	Match each other. Same weapon.
166	00:11:09	00:11:11	Great. Did you get a hit on IBIS? No.
167	00:11:11	00:11:13	Caliber's never been used in a crime in the U.S.
168	00:11:13	00:11:21	But given the nature of the ammo, I called in a favor to a buddy, who ran it through the military ballistics database.
169	00:11:21	00:11:23	Nice to have friends with friends in high places.
170	00:11:23	00:11:27	The same weapon was used in a crime scene in Pakistan a month ago.
171	00:11:27	00:11:30	This gun gets around. What happened in Pakistan?
172	00:11:30	00:11:33	Military supplies were stolen; a warehouse guard was shot.
173	00:11:33	00:11:35	Wow, the plot thickens.
174	00:11:35	00:11:38	Yeah, and then it thins once you get to page two.
175	00:11:38	00:11:40	The report's been heavily redacted. (chuckles)
176	00:11:40	00:11:41	Yeah, I'll say.
177	00:11:41	00:11:42	The whole thing's blacked out.
178	00:11:43	00:11:45	The.
179	00:11:45	00:11:47	Hey, can I keep one of these? Sure.
180	00:11:47	00:11:49	We're looking for D.B. Russell.
181	00:11:49	00:11:51	That's me.
182	00:11:51	00:11:52	Who are you guys?
183	00:11:52	00:11:54	We ran a test on the victim's hair.
184	00:11:54	00:12:02	The oxygen isotopes that are found in the local water supplies leave markers in the hair, which indicate where Mr. Newbury has been in the last three months.
185	00:12:02	00:12:05	Each .44 millimeters of hair is a day in the life.
186	00:12:05	00:12:09	And, oh, the places he's been in those five centimeters.
187	00:12:11	00:12:17	Iraq, DC, Israel, Belgium, DC again, Pakistan.
188	00:12:17	00:12:21	Have guns, did travel. But there are no official records of him going to any of these places.
189	00:12:21	00:12:26	No airline tickets, immunization, State Department records-- nothing.
190	00:12:26	00:12:29	So his passport's never been stamped, but his body's been around the world?
191	00:12:29	00:12:32	Extended family meeting-- now, please.
192	00:12:32	00:12:34	What... did he mean by extended?
193	00:12:34	00:12:35	Hey, come on in, everybody.
194	00:12:35	00:12:37	I want to...
195	00:12:37	00:12:40	I want to introduce a couple of people to you.
196	00:12:40	00:12:42	This is Agent McQuaid, Special-Agent-in-Charge Pratt.
197	00:12:42	00:12:46	They're with the Las Vegas field office of the FBI.
198	00:12:46	00:12:48	We're here to help you with the Michael Newbury homicide.
199	00:12:48	00:12:51	You mean you're here to take over the case from us.
200	00:12:51	00:12:52	Not at all.
201	00:12:52	00:12:54	No, this case is still under Las Vegas PD jurisdiction.
202	00:12:54	00:12:57	We're just here to offer our assistance.
203	00:12:57	00:12:59	Assistance with what, exactly?
204	00:12:59	00:13:01	That, I'm afraid, is on a need-to-know basis.
205	00:13:01	00:13:03	And who decides who needs to know?
206	00:13:03	00:13:08	Anyway, we're really Oh, yeah, ditto.
207	00:13:08	00:13:09	Hey, hey. Come on.
208	00:13:09	00:13:10	Let's play nice.
209	00:13:19	00:13:21	Oh, boy, that's good.
210	00:13:21	00:13:24	Sure I can't get you any, uh, soy milk for that?
211	00:13:24	00:13:26	A little agave?
212	00:13:26	00:13:28	No. No, thank you. Black's great.
213	00:13:28	00:13:30	All right.
214	00:13:30	00:13:32	So, here we are. We said we'd brief you.
215	00:13:32	00:13:33	Who's she?
216	00:13:33	00:13:34	I'm sorry.
217	00:13:34	00:13:35	This is Catherine.
218	00:13:35	00:13:37	And Catherine was me before I was.
219	00:13:37	00:13:41	And I have assigned Catherine to be the lead on this case.
220	00:13:41	00:13:44	Okay? So...
221	00:13:44	00:13:45	what is going on here?
222	00:13:45	00:13:49	I mean, we got a room full of guns, we got missing bodies, and now the FBI?
223	00:13:49	00:13:50	Is this domestic terrorism?
224	00:13:50	00:13:55	We have no reason to believe that Mr. Newbury was... a threat.
225	00:13:55	00:13:56	No, he was a ballistics consultant, right?
226	00:13:56	00:13:59	Yours or the military's?
227	00:13:59	00:14:00	What makes you say that?
228	00:14:00	00:14:02	Oh, I didn't say it.
229	00:14:02	00:14:03	A strand of his hair did.
230	00:14:03	00:14:10	For three months, he's been jumping from DC to every artillery hot spot on the globe.
231	00:14:10	00:14:12	We can't really speak to that.
232	00:14:12	00:14:16	Can you speak to why you fellas are so interested in his death?
233	00:14:16	00:14:19	We're more interested in the weapon that we believe killed him.
234	00:14:19	00:14:25	This is the FN-P90, manufactured in Belgium, currently used by U.S. troops in urban sweeps of Afghanistan.
235	00:14:25	00:14:27	It's an entry weapon.
236	00:14:27	00:14:32	It's got a lot of power, a compact frame that allows you to go around corners and sweep stairwells-- it's a bit of a beast.
237	00:14:32	00:14:35	And how the hell did that thing get into Clark County?
238	00:14:35	00:14:36	I'm afraid that's classified.
239	00:14:36	00:14:38	Yes, of course it is.
240	00:14:38	00:14:43	Hey, out of curiosity, what year did you graduate from Brigham Young?
241	00:14:43	00:14:49	'03. How'd you know? FBI recruiters are all over that place like chickens on a June bug.
242	00:14:49	00:14:51	Am I right? If you're...
243	00:14:51	00:14:55	concerned with my age, I promise you, I've earned my stripes.
244	00:14:55	00:14:57	So have I.
245	00:14:57	00:15:00	Every suspicious cargo container in Seattle came with a pair of you guys.
246	00:15:00	00:15:04	Eight out of ten times, it was great.
247	00:15:04	00:15:07	Resources, manpower-- made my job a hell of a lot easier.
248	00:15:07	00:15:09	And... the other two?
249	00:15:09	00:15:17	Well, you guys would lose interest and chase off after the next shiny object, leaving us with a pretty shoddy chain of custody.
250	00:15:17	00:15:23	We have no intention of compromising your investigation. I have no intention of letting you. So, here's what we're gonna do.
251	00:15:23	00:15:25	We are going to pair up.
252	00:15:25	00:15:26	Mixed doubles, all right?
253	00:15:26	00:15:29	All right? Every CSI gets an FBI.
254	00:15:29	00:15:33	Catherine, why don't you take Agent McQuaid, go back out to the farm, re-scour the place.
255	00:15:33	00:15:35	Let's get a bead on that body.
256	00:15:35	00:15:36	Okay? I'll drive?
257	00:15:36	00:15:39	Hey, I got my own driver.
258	00:15:39	00:15:40	Score.
259	00:15:41	00:15:43	And what about me? You...
260	00:15:43	00:15:45	are my new best friend.
261	00:15:45	00:15:51	Somebody spilled ink all over my Pakistani crime report, and I'm just betting...
262	00:15:51	00:15:53	I mean, look at that.
263	00:15:53	00:15:57	I'm just betting that your copy's a little more legible than this one.
264	00:16:02	00:16:04	So, why are we back here?
265	00:16:04	00:16:06	Did you miss something the first time?
266	00:16:06	00:16:08	Yes. Context.
267	00:16:08	00:16:10	As your people were obscuring it.
268	00:16:10	00:16:14	We now know that someone brought a super-gun to an expert.
269	00:16:14	00:16:20	And that expert was then shot by the same weapon, in his kitchen, and he was wrapped in a shower curtain and he was brought here.
270	00:16:20	00:16:21	Where he was shot again.
271	00:16:21	00:16:23	And again.
272	00:16:23	00:16:24	Why the overkill?
273	00:16:24	00:16:26	Well, maybe it wasn't overkill.
274	00:16:26	00:16:30	I mean, based on the grouping and the volume, my guess is he zippered him.
275	00:16:30	00:16:32	Zippered? Is that what it sounds like?
276	00:16:32	00:16:36	If a weapon's cyclic rate is fast enough and the ammo's nasty enough...
277	00:16:36	00:16:39	you can actually rip right through a man.
278	00:16:43	00:16:45	Open him up...
279	00:16:45	00:16:47	like a zipper.
280	00:16:47	00:16:50	But why halve a man after the fact?
281	00:16:57	00:17:01	I'm thinking, ease of transport.
282	00:17:04	00:17:05	A whole body...
283	00:17:05	00:17:08	wouldn't fit inside one of these garbage bags.
284	00:17:08	00:17:10	They're too small.
285	00:17:10	00:17:12	Okay.
286	00:17:14	00:17:16	So the killer...
287	00:17:16	00:17:19	shreds the shower curtain, hauling the body out here...
288	00:17:19	00:17:21	and he still needs to move it.
289	00:17:21	00:17:32	Right. The tire treads that we cast in the driveway match to a Dodge pickup, so perhaps the killer zippers, stuffs, ties and throws two bags of carcass into his truck bed.
290	00:17:32	00:17:34	And gets away without a trace.
291	00:17:34	00:17:39	You know, I see idiots using garbage bags for body disposals all the time.
292	00:17:42	00:17:44	And they almost always leak.
293	00:17:54	00:17:56	Directional blood drop.
294	00:17:56	00:18:01	Its spine is telling me that he went that way.
295	00:18:07	00:18:10	Thank you. Un-redacted.
296	00:18:10	00:18:12	So much easier to read.
297	00:18:14	00:18:20	Why don't you walk me through this. Four weeks ago in Pakistan, a warehouse guard was killed trying to stop a raid on U.S. military supplies.
298	00:18:20	00:18:24	Using that same gun, the FN-P90?
299	00:18:24	00:18:27	According to the ballistics report.
300	00:18:27	00:18:31	So, when we ran that bullet through the military database, it raised a red flag on your end, right?
301	00:18:31	00:18:33	That's why you're here?
302	00:18:33	00:18:35	To be frank, it's the only flag that we've had.
303	00:18:35	00:18:38	I mean, we never recovered any supplies and didn't find the shooter.
304	00:18:38	00:18:40	Who did the work-up on this for you?
305	00:18:40	00:18:43	Are you familiar with the term battlefield forensics?
306	00:18:43	00:18:46	That's CSI on speed, right?
307	00:18:46	00:18:48	Except people are dropping bombs on you and shooting at you.
308	00:18:48	00:18:52	This scene in Pakistan was processed by operatives working for Ceressus Logistics.
309	00:18:52	00:18:55	It's a U.S. military contractor. Yeah.
310	00:18:55	00:18:58	They handle most of the law enforcement in our overseas operations, right?
311	00:18:58	00:19:04	Well, as well as police training, supplies, transportation, artillery, food service, you name it.
312	00:19:04	00:19:08	And you think that those people at Ceressus are the ones who stole your supplies?
313	00:19:08	00:19:11	I didn't say that. No, you didn't have to, though.
314	00:19:11	00:19:15	I mean, if that gun was taken by an insurgent, it wouldn't have ended up in Nevada.
315	00:19:15	00:19:18	But it did-- so you got to be thinking inside job, right?
316	00:19:18	00:19:21	I mean, there's no evidence to support that.
317	00:19:21	00:19:24	Forget about evidence, just for a second.
318	00:19:24	00:19:27	What's your gut tell you?
319	00:19:27	00:19:35	It tells me that someone at Ceressus could be behind this, but I can't accuse one of our law enforcement partners of theft without having any proof.
320	00:19:35	00:19:36	No, you can't.
321	00:19:36	00:19:38	But what the heck, we can talk to them, right?
322	00:19:38	00:19:43	I mean, there was a crime scene in Pakistan-- we'd be just doing our due diligence.
323	00:19:43	00:19:45	Don't you think?
324	00:19:45	00:19:49	Your boss is kind of young.
325	00:19:49	00:19:50	He's not my boss.
326	00:19:50	00:19:52	He's my replacement.
327	00:19:52	00:19:55	I'm training him till I de-camp the Las Vegas office.
328	00:19:55	00:19:57	On to bigger and better things?
329	00:19:57	00:20:00	Mm, I don't know about better.
330	00:20:00	00:20:02	More important, I suppose.
331	00:20:02	00:20:03	More dangerous.
332	00:20:03	00:20:06	More dangerous? Really? Where?
333	00:20:07	00:20:10	Your boss, he said you were him before he was.
334	00:20:10	00:20:12	What's that about?
335	00:20:12	00:20:14	The technical term is demotion.
336	00:20:14	00:20:18	Good girl does bad. So what, are you just biding your time till you can rise to that top spot again?
337	00:20:18	00:20:21	I'm not sure I want it anymore.
338	00:20:21	00:20:23	So what do you want?
339	00:20:23	00:20:25	Right now?
340	00:20:27	00:20:30	I want more blood drops.
341	00:20:30	00:20:33	Haven't seen any in the past couple hundred yards.
342	00:20:33	00:20:35	The trail's run dry. Maybe not.
343	00:20:37	00:20:39	This is McQuaid.
344	00:20:39	00:20:41	Let's get our cadets out here to walk the line ASAP.
345	00:20:41	00:20:46	I want a couple of FLIR helicopters up in the air, and mobilize half a dozen canine units, right now.
346	00:20:46	00:20:48	I'm impressed.
347	00:20:48	00:20:50	But you can call off your dogs.
348	00:20:50	00:20:52	I got vultures.
349	00:21:07	00:21:11	Mike Newbury, I presume?
350	00:21:11	00:21:14	Looks like our feathered friends found him a few hours before we did.
351	00:21:14	00:21:17	Good call on the zippering.
352	00:21:20	00:21:23	That's the beer bottle that made our ring.
353	00:21:23	00:21:25	Check this out.
354	00:21:25	00:21:28	Ink. I think.
355	00:21:29	00:21:32	It's a tattoo...
356	00:21:32	00:21:34	but sadly...
357	00:21:34	00:21:36	it's mangled beyond recognition.
358	00:21:36	00:21:38	On purpose, right?
359	00:21:38	00:21:41	Look at the vulture nips on the rest of the body.
360	00:21:41	00:21:43	The skin is pulled.
361	00:21:43	00:21:47	These cuts here are clean, like they came from a blade of sorts.
362	00:21:51	00:21:52	Or...
363	00:21:52	00:21:56	Huh. A shattered beer bottle.
364	00:21:56	00:21:58	Killer wanted to obscure this tattoo.
365	00:21:58	00:21:59	Mission accomplished.
366	00:21:59	00:22:01	We can't tell what it was now.
367	00:22:01	00:22:04	No, not in this current state.
368	00:22:04	00:22:06	But that's the thing about tattoos.
369	00:22:06	00:22:09	You better be sure, 'cause they're forever.
370	00:22:09	00:22:11	Doc, can I take this part to go?
371	00:22:11	00:22:13	No, not yet, but we deliver.
372	00:22:16	00:22:19	Isn't this the questioned documents area?
373	00:22:19	00:22:20	Why, yes, it is.
374	00:22:20	00:22:22	And this is the Video-Spectral Comparator.
375	00:22:22	00:22:28	We use it on worn or altered papers to isolate one part of the color spectrum at a time.
376	00:22:28	00:22:30	You're going to put this in there?
377	00:22:30	00:22:32	Uh-huh.
378	00:22:32	00:22:33	Okay.
379	00:22:33	00:22:35	A tattoo's ink goes down to the dermis, right?
380	00:22:35	00:22:37	Uh-huh.
381	00:22:37	00:22:42	So, if we adjust to look for different ink colors...
382	00:22:42	00:22:45	You can pull out the tattoo fragments one color at a time.
383	00:22:47	00:22:55	Mr. Gabriel, I have to say, that when we asked to speak to a representative of Ceressus, I didn't expect the CEO.
384	00:22:55	00:23:02	I take my job seriously, Captain, and my job, above all, is to serve my country, so, whatever you need, I want you to have it. Mm.
385	00:23:02	00:23:04	Very much appreciated, sir.
386	00:23:04	00:23:09	Uh, Mr. Gabriel, your Battlefield Forensics Team processed a crime scene in Pakistan, and a gun was implicated.
387	00:23:09	00:23:15	And then, the same gun showed up stateside, last night, in this mysterious homicide.
388	00:23:15	00:23:17	Any idea how that might have happened?
389	00:23:17	00:23:20	I can't speak to the scene here, but I read my guys' report on my plane.
390	00:23:20	00:23:23	Seems pretty straightforward. Insurgent raid, right?
391	00:23:23	00:23:24	What about your men over there?
392	00:23:24	00:23:26	You know them well?
393	00:23:26	00:23:28	You trust them? I run a tight ship.
394	00:23:28	00:23:31	I hire only the best, only after excessive background checks.
395	00:23:31	00:23:35	In fact, I've had to say no to police, even FBI agents.
396	00:23:35	00:23:40	Yeah, but it's like the wild west out there, right? I mean, a war zone.
397	00:23:40	00:23:42	Rules go flying out the window.
398	00:23:42	00:23:45	Any chance somebody did something they weren't supposed to?
399	00:23:45	00:23:47	What are you saying exactly?
400	00:23:47	00:23:49	It must be very tempting, that's all.
401	00:23:49	00:23:54	You know, your people have a certain window of time where they can do as they please.
402	00:23:54	00:23:55	You know, take anything they want.
403	00:23:55	00:24:03	Like those guns, for example, and they certainly have unlimited resources to cart them anywhere they want in the world.
404	00:24:03	00:24:11	My people do exactly what yours do, Mr. Russell, but without the luxury of time or security. Hmm.
405	00:24:11	00:24:13	Let me go back a second here.
406	00:24:13	00:24:17	Didn't you just say, I read it on my plane?
407	00:24:19	00:24:27	Kind of hard to get a, you know, a lecture on luxury from somebody who just used the words, I read it on my plane, you know.
408	00:24:27	00:24:28	Muddies things, that's all.
409	00:24:28	00:24:30	Then let me be clear.
410	00:24:30	00:24:31	Yeah. Please.
411	00:24:31	00:24:35	The sort of corruption you're implying is neither encouraged nor tolerated at Ceressus.
412	00:24:35	00:24:36	Clear?
413	00:24:40	00:24:43	Laura?
414	00:24:43	00:24:46	Catherine!
415	00:24:46	00:24:47	Oh, my God.
416	00:24:47	00:24:50	What are you doing here?
417	00:24:50	00:24:52	Laura and I were friends...
418	00:24:52	00:24:54	Way too many years ago to say aloud.
419	00:24:54	00:24:55	Do you work here?
420	00:24:55	00:24:57	Uh, the crime lab. Law enforcement.
421	00:24:57	00:24:58	Really? Yeah.
422	00:24:58	00:25:00	You? Yeah, well, it's a long story.
423	00:25:00	00:25:02	What are you doing here?
424	00:25:02	00:25:05	My husband is helping out on a case with the police and the FBI.
425	00:25:05	00:25:06	Your husband's Mark Gabriel?
426	00:25:06	00:25:08	I'm sorry. Who are you?
427	00:25:08	00:25:10	Agent McQuaid. FBI.
428	00:25:11	00:25:14	You look great.
429	00:25:14	00:25:16	It's been 20 years, and I can still tell when you're lying.
430	00:25:16	00:25:19	22, and you still can't take a compliment.
431	00:25:21	00:25:23	Laura.
432	00:25:23	00:25:25	(clears throat) I got to go.
433	00:25:25	00:25:29	(phone rings) Oh, hey, um, are you in town for a while?
434	00:25:29	00:25:31	A day or two. Do you have any free time?
435	00:25:31	00:25:33	Yes. Get ahold of me here.
436	00:25:33	00:25:34	Laura, today.
437	00:25:34	00:25:36	Hey, Nicky, what's up?
438	00:25:36	00:25:38	Well, I got good news, and I got bad news.
439	00:25:38	00:25:42	The good news is, I think I found our gun.
440	00:25:42	00:25:44	Great. And the bad news?
441	00:25:53	00:25:56	16-year-old kid comes in to rob the place.
442	00:25:56	00:26:01	And the clerk must have sneezed, and the kid's weapon spits out about 50 of your magic rounds.
443	00:26:01	00:26:05	Shooter said he found it behind a Dumpster at D Street and Barlow.
444	00:26:05	00:26:06	Anybody else hurt?
445	00:26:06	00:26:08	Hell, yeah. Clerk took half a dozen.
446	00:26:08	00:26:10	He's en route to the E.R. now.
447	00:26:10	00:26:14	And the rifleman over there literally shot himself in the foot.
448	00:26:14	00:26:16	I'm just glad he ran out of ammo.
449	00:26:17	00:26:19	Think it was a little bit too much gun for him.
450	00:26:19	00:26:20	Would be for me, too.
451	00:26:20	00:26:22	That thing's a monster.
452	00:26:22	00:26:24	Glad it's off the street.
453	00:26:24	00:26:26	Okay, see you later.
454	00:26:29	00:26:30	Okay.
455	00:26:30	00:26:32	What's the matter?
456	00:26:32	00:26:36	If that one weapon got out, there may be more to follow.
457	00:26:36	00:26:38	Those are the stolen supplies you were talking about?
458	00:26:38	00:26:40	That's the problem we're here to fix.
459	00:26:40	00:26:43	That gun? The cuts-people-in-half gun?
460	00:26:43	00:26:45	Well, how many we talking about? Give me a number.
461	00:26:45	00:26:47	144.
462	00:26:47	00:26:49	144 of these?!
463	00:26:50	00:26:52	That's not a problem.
464	00:26:52	00:26:54	That's a... that's a war zone.
465	00:27:00	00:27:01	You find anything?
466	00:27:01	00:27:03	Afraid not.
467	00:27:03	00:27:04	Okay. No, no, wait, wait.
468	00:27:04	00:27:06	I found a frayed knot.
469	00:27:06	00:27:08	A thread that's been tied into a knot.
470	00:27:08	00:27:09	It was snagged in the magazine well.
471	00:27:09	00:27:13	And it's... it's frayed.
472	00:27:13	00:27:16	The thread is wool, made from refined camel hair.
473	00:27:16	00:27:19	And the knot is not just any knot.
474	00:27:19	00:27:23	It's the asymmetrical Sennah knot, a Persian knot specifically used in finer rugs.
475	00:27:23	00:27:32	See, the thread is wrapped around only one warp, and then it's passed behind to the adjacent warp, which divides the two ends, right?
476	00:27:32	00:27:36	So, these types of rugs that are woven with this knot are generally...
477	00:27:36	00:27:38	You're welcome.
478	00:27:38	00:27:42	Took a little luck and a lot of computer enhancement, but this eagle has finally landed.
479	00:27:42	00:27:43	It's military.
480	00:27:43	00:27:45	Skeleton with a beret. That's definitely military.
481	00:27:45	00:27:46	The bird's Airborne.
482	00:27:46	00:27:48	532?
483	00:27:48	00:27:49	532nd Division.
484	00:27:49	00:27:52	Killer purposefully carved out this tattoo with the beer bottle.
485	00:27:52	00:27:53	Why?
486	00:27:53	00:27:55	Something to hide?
487	00:27:55	00:27:56	Maybe he had the same tattoo.
488	00:27:56	00:27:59	Same division. A brother in arms.
489	00:27:59	00:28:00	Someone you'd share a beer with.
490	00:28:00	00:28:03	Okay, Persian carpets, plus, Army tattoo.
491	00:28:03	00:28:05	How does that equal gun runner?
492	00:28:05	00:28:06	Hey, you know what?
493	00:28:06	00:28:10	Cross-reference the 532nd Airborne with locals.
494	00:28:10	00:28:15	You drop a gun off at D street and Barlow Ave, I'm thinking you know that neighborhood pretty well.
495	00:28:15	00:28:16	Maybe even lived there.
496	00:28:16	00:28:20	Yeah, that gives us 14 candidates that served while Newbury was active.
497	00:28:20	00:28:22	Any of them drive a Dodge pickup?
498	00:28:25	00:28:28	Bingo. Lenny Wesson.
499	00:28:28	00:28:30	I got him. Yeah, he grew up in the alphabets.
500	00:28:30	00:28:32	Dishonorably discharged.
501	00:28:32	00:28:34	Went the way of the rap sheet.
502	00:28:34	00:28:36	Catches work as an independent truck driver.
503	00:28:36	00:28:39	He drives a '97 Peterbilt semi.
504	00:28:39	00:28:41	But he doesn't work for Ceressus.
505	00:28:41	00:28:42	But he wouldn't. He's not smart enough.
506	00:28:42	00:28:44	Remember? Only the brightest and the best.
507	00:28:44	00:28:46	Background checks. Blah, blah, blah.
508	00:28:46	00:28:49	Now, you know, I think Lenny may be our weak link.
509	00:28:49	00:28:54	So someone from Ceressus boosts the guns in Pakistan, brings them into the country, and he's got to move them.
510	00:28:54	00:28:56	He calls an ex-foxhole buddy.
511	00:28:56	00:28:59	They ask Lenny the truck driver to haul some cargo.
512	00:28:59	00:29:00	Haul some Persian carpets maybe.
513	00:29:00	00:29:03	And maybe Lenny got a look at what he was really lugging.
514	00:29:03	00:29:07	He took 'em to an expert to see What he still has.
515	00:29:07	00:29:10	Until he unloads 'em, which could be right now.
516	00:29:10	00:29:11	We got to find Lenny and his truck.
517	00:29:11	00:29:14	Lucky for us, we have the weight of the FBI behind us.
518	00:29:14	00:29:15	Come on, B.Y.U.
519	00:29:15	00:29:18	If you want to throw some weight around, now's the time.
520	00:29:18	00:29:22	It's nice, all our kids playing so well together.
521	00:29:22	00:29:24	It's called a citizen broadcast.
522	00:29:24	00:29:26	We set it up with DHS after 9/11.
523	00:29:26	00:29:31	Pretty much puts us into contact with every private company on the road-- UPS, FedEx, trucking companies.
524	00:29:31	00:29:33	All eyes on the road become our eyes.
525	00:29:33	00:29:36	Like CB radio on steroids.
526	00:29:36	00:29:38	What's a CB radio?
527	00:29:38	00:29:39	I was joking.
528	00:29:39	00:29:40	Got something!
529	00:29:40	00:29:42	Driver spotted...
530	00:29:42	00:29:46	suspect Wesson going eastbound in a green Peterbilt semi on Route 164.
531	00:30:05	00:30:08	What are you doing?
532	00:30:08	00:30:14	Busted a dozen arms exchanges from Honduras to Somalia, and by definition, both sides are armed, which makes everyone paranoid.
533	00:30:14	00:30:16	Still not following why you turned off the road.
534	00:30:16	00:30:20	Because most of these things, in my experience, take place in public, hiding in plain sight.
535	00:30:20	00:30:24	Oh, and if you want to hide a truck in plain sight, there's one obvious place to do it.
536	00:30:33	00:30:35	Plate's a match.
537	00:30:40	00:30:45	Special Agent McQuaid, requesting backup-- truck stop at mile marker one-two-five.
538	00:30:45	00:30:46	Confirming mile marker one-two-five.
539	00:30:46	00:30:47	Sending backup.
540	00:31:07	00:31:09	Anybody in the market for a rug?
541	00:31:09	00:31:11	I was imagining something with a little more pop.
542	00:31:11	00:31:15	From the looks of it, somebody already took the guns.
543	00:31:22	00:31:23	Lenny Wesson? (muffled groans)
544	00:31:24	00:31:25	Hey!
545	00:31:27	00:31:28	Oh, crap!
546	00:31:29	00:31:30	Get down!
547	00:31:43	00:31:44	Grab him!
548	00:32:10	00:32:12	There's another one out there!
549	00:32:17	00:32:18	(sirens blaring) It's all good! It's all good!
550	00:32:18	00:32:21	You okay?
551	00:32:23	00:32:25	Yeah?
552	00:32:25	00:32:26	Yeah. I'm good.
553	00:32:32	00:32:34	Looks like we got the rest of the shipment.
554	00:32:50	00:32:52	I guess we should thank you.
555	00:32:52	00:32:57	You helped us flush out some gunrunners that we were looking for.
556	00:32:57	00:32:59	Course they wouldn't have guns to run, were it not for you.
557	00:32:59	00:33:01	Not to mention the murder of Michael Newbury.
558	00:33:01	00:33:03	Mike who?
559	00:33:03	00:33:04	I don't know what y'all are talking about.
560	00:33:04	00:33:07	I didn't even know there was any guns in that truck.
561	00:33:07	00:33:11	Your saliva and prints are all over that bottle.
562	00:33:11	00:33:14	You were smart enough to take it from the crime scene, but stupid enough to leave it with the body.
563	00:33:14	00:33:16	You served under Newbury, for a whole tour.
564	00:33:16	00:33:18	He invites you into his home and then you kill him.
565	00:33:18	00:33:19	Why?
566	00:33:21	00:33:23	W...
567	00:33:23	00:33:25	We were supposed to be brothers.
568	00:33:27	00:33:29	All of us.
569	00:33:29	00:33:33	And they go on... to contracting jobs and consultant gigs.
570	00:33:33	00:33:37	A bunch of them are working for Ceressus now, and they're living the good life.
571	00:33:37	00:33:40	But a rising tide didn't lift all boats.
572	00:33:40	00:33:42	You fell on harder times.
573	00:33:42	00:33:44	Yeah, I was always the idiot kid brother.
574	00:33:44	00:33:46	Okay?
575	00:33:46	00:33:48	Finally, I get a score.
576	00:33:48	00:33:51	I brought the guns to Newbury because I knew he knew guns.
577	00:33:51	00:33:53	It's great to see you, man.
578	00:33:53	00:33:55	And at first he was happy to help.
579	00:33:55	00:33:56	Hey, uh, you mind taking a look at something?
580	00:33:56	00:33:58	Sure, what do you got?
581	00:33:58	00:33:59	Nice, huh?
582	00:33:59	00:34:00	You want a beer?
583	00:34:00	00:34:02	All right.
584	00:34:02	00:34:05	But as soon as he got his hands on them guns, his whole mood changed.
585	00:34:05	00:34:06	Lenny...
586	00:34:06	00:34:08	these guns were stolen from the military.
587	00:34:08	00:34:11	This is serious trouble.
588	00:34:11	00:34:13	I'll tell you what.
589	00:34:13	00:34:15	I'll return them for you.
590	00:34:15	00:34:16	Anonymously.
591	00:34:18	00:34:19	Okay?
592	00:34:19	00:34:20	I had bills to pay.
593	00:34:20	00:34:22	Take this.
594	00:34:29	00:34:31	They all got their golden tickets.
595	00:34:31	00:34:33	Well, these guns were mine.
596	00:34:33	00:34:34	They weren't your guns, Lenny.
597	00:34:34	00:34:35	They were stolen.
598	00:34:35	00:34:37	We know you were just a middleman.
599	00:34:37	00:34:41	Who threw you the driving gig?
600	00:34:41	00:34:42	Was it another ex-Ranger?
601	00:34:42	00:34:44	Someone from Ceressus?
602	00:34:44	00:34:45	You think I'm a rat?
603	00:34:45	00:34:48	We know that Ceressus is implicated; we just want to know how far up the ladder it goes.
604	00:34:48	00:34:51	Yeah, well, you know so much...
605	00:34:51	00:34:53	what do you need me for?
606	00:34:53	00:34:55	We need someone to say it in court.
607	00:34:57	00:35:01	You cooperate, maybe we could shave a few years off your sentence.
608	00:35:01	00:35:03	Years?
609	00:35:03	00:35:05	Years?
610	00:35:07	00:35:10	If I tell you everything...
611	00:35:10	00:35:12	everyone involved...
612	00:35:12	00:35:13	I want immunity.
613	00:35:13	00:35:15	Immunity?
614	00:35:15	00:35:16	Protection from-from-from it all.
615	00:35:16	00:35:17	You killed a man, Lenny.
616	00:35:17	00:35:19	You put those guns out on the street.
617	00:35:19	00:35:20	Immunity?
618	00:35:20	00:35:22	Forget it. That's not going to happen.
619	00:35:22	00:35:24	Actually...
620	00:35:24	00:35:27	it is.
621	00:35:27	00:35:33	If you can give us the names of all of your contacts and it turns into something substantial.
622	00:35:33	00:35:35	Wh-What are you doing?
623	00:35:35	00:35:37	You can't decide... Yes, we can.
624	00:35:37	00:35:38	Good.
625	00:35:38	00:35:40	I'm sorry, I gotta pull rank here.
626	00:35:40	00:35:43	I'm going to need a lawyer to draw up the papers before I say a single word to y'all.
627	00:35:43	00:35:44	Okay.
628	00:35:44	00:35:45	Whatever you need.
629	00:35:52	00:35:54	Why the change in venue?
630	00:35:54	00:35:58	Well, this interview is a little less informal than our last.
631	00:35:58	00:36:01	Am I under suspicion for something?
632	00:36:01	00:36:03	No. I mean, not you specifically.
633	00:36:03	00:36:05	Yet.
634	00:36:05	00:36:08	This is the beginning of an official inquiry of Ceressus.
635	00:36:08	00:36:12	We just wanted to give you the courtesy of letting you know.
636	00:36:12	00:36:14	And the opportunity to get on the record sooner than later.
637	00:36:14	00:36:16	Courtesy?
638	00:36:16	00:36:17	Is that what this is?
639	00:36:17	00:36:25	Look, I know you have free rein on your global turf, but somebody in your outfit brought those guns into mine and I want some answers.
640	00:36:25	00:36:31	We're gonna need all of the names of the men involved in that gun theft and then we're going to want access to all of your personnel files.
641	00:36:31	00:36:33	I'm not giving you anything but politeness.
642	00:36:33	00:36:36	To be honest with you, I'm running out of that fast.
643	00:36:36	00:36:37	Yeah. Mr. Gabriel...
644	00:36:37	00:36:41	If you want to make demands of me, have your boss's boss call me.
645	00:36:41	00:36:44	Otherwise, I'm done here.
646	00:36:45	00:36:47	Actually, you know what?
647	00:36:47	00:36:48	There's one more thing.
648	00:36:48	00:36:50	What's that?
649	00:36:50	00:36:57	You see, all these guns that are now Stateside have to go back to the troops in Afghanistan.
650	00:36:57	00:37:00	You know, given your resources, and your patriotism...
651	00:37:00	00:37:03	That's going to cost me half a million dollars.
652	00:37:03	00:37:05	Oh, at least.
653	00:37:05	00:37:07	Thanks for your time.
654	00:37:15	00:37:17	Your daughter is beautiful.
655	00:37:17	00:37:20	She is, isn't she?
656	00:37:20	00:37:22	I'm jealous.
657	00:37:22	00:37:23	Jealous?
658	00:37:23	00:37:26	Laura, look at you.
659	00:37:26	00:37:28	The good life, the billionaire husband.
660	00:37:28	00:37:30	You got it all.
661	00:37:31	00:37:33	So how is your mom?
662	00:37:37	00:37:39	Laura...
663	00:37:40	00:37:42	...why are you here?
664	00:37:42	00:37:45	To catch up, just like we talked about.
665	00:37:45	00:37:48	Which has been great. Really.
666	00:37:48	00:37:50	But...
667	00:37:50	00:37:55	I just have this feeling that there's something you want to say.
668	00:37:55	00:37:57	Is it about Mark?
669	00:37:57	00:37:59	'Cause I saw the way he talked to you.
670	00:37:59	00:38:00	Does he hurt you?
671	00:38:00	00:38:02	No. No, he doesn't.
672	00:38:02	00:38:04	It's not...
673	00:38:06	00:38:08	I heard something.
674	00:38:08	00:38:09	By accident.
675	00:38:09	00:38:11	What was it?
676	00:38:14	00:38:18	Okay, this is just me being jet-lagged.
677	00:38:18	00:38:20	I'm sorry. I should go.
678	00:38:20	00:38:26	But listen, um, it's been so nice seeing you again.
679	00:38:26	00:38:28	Hey, hang on.
680	00:38:28	00:38:31	I just want to make sure you have all my numbers, okay?
681	00:38:33	00:38:34	Uh...
682	00:38:34	00:38:37	Okay.
683	00:38:37	00:38:38	All right.
684	00:38:38	00:38:40	So I want you to call me if you need anything.
685	00:38:40	00:38:42	And I mean anything.
686	00:38:42	00:38:45	Is there a reason you wrote this on the back of a lawyer's card?
687	00:38:45	00:38:47	Random coincidence.
688	00:38:47	00:38:49	Coincidentally, he's a good lawyer.
689	00:38:49	00:38:52	He's Sam's guy.
690	00:38:52	00:38:53	I think you might need that.
691	00:38:53	00:38:55	Okay. Thanks.
692	00:38:57	00:38:59	Okay. Thank you.
693	00:38:59	00:39:01	All right. Bye.
694	00:39:14	00:39:16	Oh.
695	00:39:16	00:39:18	Did you guys have a good conversation?
696	00:39:18	00:39:20	How long have you been standing outside my house?
697	00:39:20	00:39:21	Not important.
698	00:39:21	00:39:22	I...
699	00:39:22	00:39:23	The thing is...
700	00:39:25	00:39:30	...I'm here-- my foot in the door, my hat in hand, a bottle in the other.
701	00:39:30	00:39:32	It's beer. It's Belgian.
702	00:39:32	00:39:35	You know, guns aren't the only thing they, uh, they make.
703	00:39:35	00:39:38	I'd like to apologize.
704	00:39:38	00:39:40	About the whole Lenny of it all.
705	00:39:40	00:39:42	I blindsided you, and...
706	00:39:42	00:39:43	It sucked.
707	00:39:43	00:39:45	Yeah, it sucked.
708	00:39:45	00:39:47	But it's the job.
709	00:39:47	00:39:48	I have a job, too.
710	00:39:48	00:39:50	And you did it kind of perfectly.
711	00:39:50	00:39:55	You got the guns back, by way of vultures, and garbage bags and whatnot.
712	00:39:55	00:39:59	By whatnot you mean saving your ass?
713	00:40:00	00:40:01	I do.
714	00:40:07	00:40:10	But the thing is, I had to cut a deal with Wesson.
715	00:40:10	00:40:13	And I would do it again.
716	00:40:13	00:40:15	This isn't much of an apology.
717	00:40:15	00:40:18	But if I did it again, I would tell you beforehand.
718	00:40:18	00:40:20	You deserve that.
719	00:40:20	00:40:21	At least that.
720	00:40:22	00:40:25	Maybe more.
721	00:40:40	00:40:42	Willows.
722	00:40:42	00:40:44	McQuaid.
723	00:40:44	00:40:47	Lenny Wesson died en route to a federal holding facility.
724	00:40:47	00:40:49	How? Heart attack.
725	00:40:49	00:40:50	Heart attack? He was 37 years old.
726	00:40:50	00:40:51	How did he die of a heart attack?
727	00:40:51	00:40:53	We need to run a tox panel.
728	00:40:53	00:40:55	You won't find anything.
729	00:40:55	00:40:59	What, you think that Mark Gabriel is covering his tracks?
730	00:40:59	00:41:01	I do, and I think he's really good at it.
731	00:41:01	00:41:03	Okay, so that's it?
732	00:41:03	00:41:04	No, we gotta do something.
733	00:41:04	00:41:08	No, you guys did your job-- the guns are off the street.
734	00:41:08	00:41:09	I think this is our responsibility.
735	00:41:09	00:41:11	Agent McQuaid and myself are due back at Quantico.
736	00:41:11	00:41:13	It's back to square one.
737	00:41:13	00:41:15	It's been a real honor.
738	00:41:15	00:41:17	Great work. Thank you.
739	00:41:17	00:41:18	Wait, whoa, wait, hold it a second.
740	00:41:18	00:41:21	I got a little going away present for you.
741	00:41:21	00:41:23	Is that a mushroom?
742	00:41:23	00:41:24	Hericium erinaceus.
743	00:41:24	00:41:26	Lion's mane.
744	00:41:26	00:41:29	It improves cognitive function and promotes well-being.
745	00:41:29	00:41:32	I like just a little thin slice on my toast in the morning.
746	00:41:32	00:41:33	Thanks.
747	00:41:33	00:41:36	I think. (Russell chuckles)
748	00:41:37	00:41:39	Uh...
749	00:41:39	00:41:43	you sure you're not just trying to ruin my drug screening?
750	00:41:43	00:41:44	No, no.
751	00:41:44	00:41:46	You should be all right with that, I think.
752	00:41:46	00:41:48	Yeah, pretty sure.
753	00:41:48	00:41:52	CSI Willows, it has been, uh, a real pleasure working with you.
754	00:41:52	00:41:55	Likewise, Agent McQuaid.
755	00:41:57	00:41:59	Good luck with the new job and everything.
756	00:42:06	00:42:08	Stay away from badges.
757	00:42:08	00:42:12	I tell my daughter every morning, If he wears a badge, he's wrong for you.
758	00:42:12	00:42:14	Really?
759	00:42:14	00:42:17	And what if your wife's father had told her the same thing?
760	00:42:18	00:42:21	Actually, he did.
761	00:42:21	00:42:22	See you tomorrow.
762	00:42:22	00:42:24	Regular time.
