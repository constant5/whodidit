0	00:00:20	00:00:22	Come on!
1	00:00:22	00:00:24	Honey, just pass him.
2	00:00:27	00:00:29	Move it!
3	00:00:29	00:00:31	Calm down and just pass him.
4	00:00:47	00:00:48	Hey, Jim!
5	00:00:50	00:00:51	We got a call.
6	00:00:51	00:00:53	A possible 4-19.
7	00:00:53	00:00:55	Is there a dead body or not?
8	00:00:55	00:00:58	That arm crash-landed on the windshield of the car.
9	00:00:59	00:01:01	According to the driver, it shot out from under the bus.
10	00:01:03	00:01:07	Generally speaking, where there's an arm, there's a body.
11	00:01:07	00:01:09	What say we check out the bus?
12	00:01:09	00:01:11	Good call.
13	00:01:12	00:01:16	Now, the, uh, passengers were on their way to St. Matthew's Church in Pioche.
14	00:01:16	00:01:20	They were from a work release program at Nevada Correctional Institution.
15	00:01:20	00:01:22	Okay, well, I got some blood on the wheel well.
16	00:01:27	00:01:29	Oh, yeah, that's a definite on the 4-19.
17	00:01:30	00:01:35	Um, well... appears to be female.
18	00:01:35	00:01:36	Caucasian.
19	00:01:36	00:01:38	Tied to the undercarriage...
20	00:01:38	00:01:40	maybe.
21	00:01:40	00:01:42	Hitch a ride under a bus.
22	00:01:42	00:01:45	Well, that's one way to get out jail.
23	00:01:45	00:01:50	Yeah, and I bet this big boy spit out body parts all the way down the road.
24	00:01:50	00:01:54	So... the bus is traveling 65 miles per hour.
25	00:01:54	00:02:00	What's the distance from the tip of her nose to the tip of her toes?
26	00:02:05	00:02:09	and Volkswagen. On the road of life there are passengers and there are drivers.
27	00:02:39	00:02:43	Well, looks like she used strips from a white cotton sheet.
28	00:02:43	00:02:47	Yeah, use whatever's available when you're breaking out of prison, I guess.
29	00:02:51	00:02:53	Low thread count.
30	00:02:53	00:02:57	Average tensile strength wasn't strong enough to support her weight.
31	00:03:04	00:03:08	The torque of the spinning axle ripped her apart like the rubber off a bad retread.
32	00:03:08	00:03:12	Yep. If she'd used a nylon rope, she'd be on her way to Tijuana. Right.
33	00:03:12	00:03:15	I'll call Auto Detail, have the bus sent to the garage, yeah?
34	00:03:15	00:03:19	Oh, hey, after that, grab Sarah and go directly to jail.
35	00:03:19	00:03:23	I'm going to supervise this body part collection.
36	00:04:24	00:04:27	Okay, David, I think that's it.
37	00:04:27	00:04:30	I'll get these parts to Dr. Robbins.
38	00:04:30	00:04:33	He'll start putting her back together.
39	00:04:52	00:04:54	Helter-skelter.
40	00:04:54	00:04:56	Yeah...
41	00:04:56	00:05:00	except there's no blood spatter on the walls or the ceiling.
42	00:05:00	00:05:02	We have the murder weapon.
43	00:05:02	00:05:03	Stabbed in the chest.
44	00:05:09	00:05:10	There's two of them in that apartment.
45	00:05:10	00:05:12	The name's Adanto Adams.
46	00:05:12	00:05:15	He don't live in that apartment.
47	00:05:15	00:05:16	He's visiting from out of town.
48	00:05:16	00:05:18	That's Zero's little brother.
49	00:05:18	00:05:20	Zero?
50	00:05:20	00:05:22	Zero Adams. He's the one who lives there.
51	00:05:32	00:05:41	Well, unless he was bending over the sofa with his chest pushed against this cushion, this bloodstain is inconsistent with that wound.
52	00:05:42	00:05:45	Paul, would you turn him over for us?
53	00:05:53	00:05:55	Oh, yeah.
54	00:05:55	00:05:59	Stabbed in the chest and the back.
55	00:05:59	00:06:01	So, uh, where is this Zero now?
56	00:06:01	00:06:03	I don't know.
57	00:06:03	00:06:06	I'm not his mother. I'm his landlord.
58	00:06:06	00:06:09	Well, if you see him, give me a call.
59	00:06:09	00:06:11	Yeah, yeah, sure.
60	00:06:14	00:06:20	When I do a jigsaw puzzle, I like to start with a corner piece. When the puzzle's a body, the corner piece is the pelvis.
61	00:06:20	00:06:24	Oh, uh, Nick ID'd your vic.
62	00:06:24	00:06:26	She missed her last bed check.
63	00:06:26	00:06:28	Convict #6920.
64	00:06:28	00:06:31	Antoinette Stella.
65	00:06:31	00:06:34	Two-year sentence for identity theft.
66	00:06:34	00:06:36	She was due for release next month.
67	00:06:36	00:06:38	Guess she was in a hurry.
68	00:06:38	00:06:40	No, she wasn't trying to escape.
69	00:06:40	00:06:43	She was murdered.
70	00:06:43	00:06:46	I dissected her arm.
71	00:06:47	00:06:52	The blood in the brachial artery is clotted, which is indicative of a post-mortem laceration.
72	00:06:52	00:06:55	Have you determined the cause of death?
73	00:06:55	00:06:57	Yep.
74	00:06:57	00:06:59	Cranio-cerebral injury...
75	00:07:00	00:07:02	...due to blunt- force trauma.
76	00:07:02	00:07:06	Depressed skull fracture imbedded with tiny white fibers.
77	00:07:06	00:07:13	Given the depth and position of the, uh, fracture, I'd say she was hit on the head with something hard on the inside and white and fuzzy on the outside.
78	00:07:13	00:07:15	I'd like a clean look at that fracture.
79	00:07:15	00:07:17	Sure. I'll start her bath.
80	00:07:17	00:07:18	Anything else?
81	00:07:18	00:07:21	Well, you might want to check out her left forearm.
82	00:07:24	00:07:28	Birthmark? Rap sheet's referenced dermatological anomalies.
83	00:07:28	00:07:30	According to her, she didn't have any.
84	00:07:34	00:07:36	I'll take a slice down to Histology.
85	00:07:39	00:07:43	We locked down as soon as we got the call.
86	00:07:43	00:07:44	We do bed checks six times a day.
87	00:07:44	00:07:47	All inmates were accounted for at 1300 hours.
88	00:07:47	00:07:49	What time did the bus leave for church?
89	00:07:49	00:07:51	1330.
90	00:07:51	00:07:55	Hey, sexy, how 'bout you come back here on your day off? No gag reflex.
91	00:07:55	00:08:00	Watch it, Harris. Got a drawer full of C-9s with your name on 'em. What are you lookin' at?
92	00:08:04	00:08:06	What can you tell us about the vic?
93	00:08:06	00:08:09	Antoinette? She was popular with the other inmates.
94	00:08:09	00:08:11	No enemies to speak of.
95	00:08:11	00:08:12	This was Antoinette's cell.
96	00:08:12	00:08:14	Christine, you're going to step out.
97	00:08:14	00:08:16	Officer.
98	00:08:22	00:08:24	When's the last time you saw Baby Girl?
99	00:08:24	00:08:25	I'll need to check my calendar.
100	00:08:25	00:08:28	Don't get stupid on me, Christine.
101	00:08:28	00:08:29	Baby Girl-- was that a street name?
102	00:08:29	00:08:31	Yes. That's what everyone called her.
103	00:08:31	00:08:33	Christine?
104	00:08:33	00:08:36	I saw Baby Girl at lunch 'bout an hour before we got on the bus.
105	00:08:41	00:08:43	Hey, that's my locker.
106	00:08:43	00:08:45	I didn't take none of Baby's stuff.
107	00:08:45	00:08:46	Didn't say you did.
108	00:08:46	00:08:47	Look...
109	00:08:47	00:08:49	I didn't hardly know Baby Girl.
110	00:08:49	00:08:50	She only lived up in here eight days.
111	00:08:50	00:08:52	Eight days?
112	00:08:52	00:08:54	In this cell.
113	00:08:54	00:08:57	Few weeks ago, I found her smuggling contraband.
114	00:08:57	00:09:00	It was just a silver necklace.
115	00:09:00	00:09:02	Inmates aren't allowed jewelry.
116	00:09:02	00:09:04	It wasn't a major infraction, but I transferred her cell.
117	00:09:06	00:09:07	Makeup, deodorant, shampoo.
118	00:09:07	00:09:12	Inmates are allowed commissary visits once a month, unless they rack up two weeks in nights.
119	00:09:12	00:09:14	Do you keep track of purchases?
120	00:09:14	00:09:16	I can get you a list.
121	00:09:16	00:09:22	And just for the record, in the state of Nevada, there's never been a homicide in a female correctional facility. Until now.
122	00:09:28	00:09:29	What are you doing?
123	00:09:29	00:09:32	I'm ruling you out as a suspect, ma'am.
124	00:09:36	00:09:38	No evidence of blood.
125	00:09:38	00:09:40	I could've told you that.
126	00:09:40	00:09:45	Warden, could you show us where the bus was parked before it left the facility?
127	00:09:45	00:09:48	The bus was stationed right here.
128	00:09:48	00:09:49	Are you the only driver?
129	00:09:49	00:09:50	Only bus driver.
130	00:09:50	00:09:53	Got my CDLC last May.
131	00:09:53	00:09:56	Attention, inmates...
132	00:09:56	00:09:59	Officer, before you drove out of here, did you inspect the vehicle?
133	00:09:59	00:10:03	Miss... Sidle, I don't get time to scratch my ass.
134	00:10:03	00:10:06	I haven't had a junior officer in my department in two years.
135	00:10:06	00:10:10	Now, usually, I work the road, and when the warden asks, I take inmates on field trips.
136	00:10:10	00:10:14	Did you know the dead woman, Baby Girl, Antoinette Stella?
137	00:10:14	00:10:20	Start seeing 'em as real people, start carin' when they go back to their pimp dealer scumbag boyfriend?
138	00:10:20	00:10:21	That's enlightened.
139	00:10:21	00:10:22	That's reality.
140	00:10:22	00:10:25	No sign of a struggle, no evidence of a body drag.
141	00:10:25	00:10:30	If the attack didn't happen in her cell or in here, maybe it happened on the bus.
142	00:10:30	00:10:32	Who maintains your transpo fleet?
143	00:10:32	00:10:34	Fleet? We got three antique buses.
144	00:10:34	00:10:35	Inmates do all the work.
145	00:10:35	00:10:38	You allow inmates to service your prison vehicles?
146	00:10:38	00:10:39	You bet.
147	00:10:39	00:10:43	On Saturday, I even bring in my SUV.
148	00:10:43	00:10:44	Juanita washes it.
149	00:10:44	00:10:46	Ain't that right, Juana?
150	00:10:46	00:10:49	I've got to get something on top of my $11.65 an hour.
151	00:10:50	00:10:53	Look, we're in the middle of the desert.
152	00:10:53	00:10:56	We're a hundred miles from the pit of nowhere.
153	00:10:56	00:10:57	Is that gate always unlocked?
154	00:10:57	00:11:00	It's not like someone's going to hot-wire the bus and hightail it out of here.
155	00:11:00	00:11:06	Right, so essentially anyone in the prison population could have walked into the garage, onto the bus and no one would have said boo?
156	00:11:06	00:11:08	Boo.
157	00:12:28	00:12:33	I got a call at work and was told to get over here right away and he's not here.
158	00:12:33	00:12:35	Detective, I got your page.
159	00:12:35	00:12:38	Hey, we were canvassing the area when Mr. Samuels showed up.
160	00:12:38	00:12:39	He says he's the tenant's guardian.
161	00:12:40	00:12:40	He's got questions.
162	00:12:41	00:12:42	So do I.
163	00:12:42	00:12:44	Mr. Samuels, I'm Warrick Brown.
164	00:12:44	00:12:46	I'm from the Crime Lab.
165	00:12:46	00:12:47	What happened to Zero?
166	00:12:47	00:12:49	There's crime tape on his door.
167	00:12:49	00:12:51	These guys won't let me in.
168	00:12:51	00:12:52	His brother was murdered.
169	00:12:53	00:12:54	Adanto.
170	00:12:54	00:12:55	Did you know him?
171	00:12:55	00:12:57	Yeah, I've known them both since they were kids.
172	00:12:57	00:12:59	Frank...
173	00:12:59	00:13:01	Zero.
174	00:13:01	00:13:02	I'm so sorry.
175	00:13:05	00:13:07	I'm sorry.
176	00:13:27	00:13:29	Absorption.
177	00:13:31	00:13:33	Blood?
178	00:13:33	00:13:36	Yeah, and it's more than just a paper cut.
179	00:13:36	00:13:37	I'll swab it for DNA.
180	00:13:47	00:13:49	Florescence.
181	00:13:49	00:13:51	Bluish-white.
182	00:14:06	00:14:09	Acid phosphatase tests positive.
183	00:14:10	00:14:13	What is semen doing in the back of a female prison bus?
184	00:14:20	00:14:21	It's okay, Zero.
185	00:14:22	00:14:23	Just answer the questions.
186	00:14:26	00:14:30	I said I was sorry 'cause I'm not supposed to be out by myself.
187	00:14:30	00:14:32	So, why did you go out?
188	00:14:34	00:14:40	Well, I came home from special school, I found Adanto in the kitchen.
189	00:14:42	00:14:46	I love you, I love you Adanto.
190	00:14:48	00:14:51	When was the last time you talked to your brother?
191	00:14:55	00:14:57	Just before school.
192	00:14:57	00:15:00	What I'm about to tell you, you can't tell anybody.
193	00:15:00	00:15:02	No. No, I won't.
194	00:15:02	00:15:03	Scout's honor.
195	00:15:03	00:15:07	We're going to be rich like we always talked about.
196	00:15:12	00:15:13	I love you, kid.
197	00:15:13	00:15:15	I love you, too.
198	00:15:15	00:15:23	Said he was going to buy me a shiny new car and a driver to take me anywhere I wanted to go.
199	00:15:25	00:15:29	He said we were going to be rich.
200	00:15:33	00:15:35	Inmates, you have ten minutes till bed check.
201	00:15:35	00:15:37	Juanita's in charge of bus detail.
202	00:15:37	00:15:40	I'm sure she'll be happy to answer your questions.
203	00:15:41	00:15:42	Juanita?
204	00:15:42	00:15:47	Do you recall the last time that you washed out the interior of the bus?
205	00:15:47	00:15:50	Yesterday, a few hours before we left for work release.
206	00:15:50	00:15:52	If something's missing, it wasn't me.
207	00:15:52	00:15:54	You can check my locker.
208	00:15:54	00:15:58	Did you notice anything unusual in the back of the bus?
209	00:15:58	00:16:00	Like what?
210	00:16:00	00:16:03	Blood or... semen?
211	00:16:03	00:16:06	Didn't see any blood.
212	00:16:06	00:16:07	What about semen?
213	00:16:07	00:16:10	Don't they still do it in the backseat in the free world?
214	00:16:10	00:16:12	Yeah.
215	00:16:12	00:16:18	But I doubt if conjugal visits are permitted in a prison bus.
216	00:16:18	00:16:20	Conjugal visits aren't permitted anywhere.
217	00:16:20	00:16:22	The ACLU was going to bring a case that's...
218	00:16:29	00:16:33	The only men permitted in this correctional facility are the correctional officers.
219	00:16:33	00:16:39	It's a Class D felony for a CO to have sexual contact with an inmate.
220	00:16:39	00:16:42	Lots of things are felonies, but people still do them.
221	00:16:43	00:16:45	Otherwise, you and I'd be out of a job.
222	00:16:47	00:16:52	The white fibers from the head wound were straight out of any Wal-Market.
223	00:16:52	00:16:55	78% cotton, 14% polyester and seven percent nylon elastic.
224	00:16:55	00:16:59	Sounds like we're looking for a lethal pair of white underpants.
225	00:16:59	00:17:03	Yeah, or a bra, pair of socks.
226	00:17:03	00:17:06	The skin discoloration, that was a real challenge.
227	00:17:06	00:17:07	You know, uh, on her forearm.
228	00:17:08	00:17:09	Looked like a birthmark.
229	00:17:09	00:17:13	Yeah, that skin sample was supposed to be sent to Histology.
230	00:17:13	00:17:15	Yeah, well, they kicked it back to me.
231	00:17:15	00:17:18	Uh, the coloration was an adulterant.
232	00:17:18	00:17:20	Aluminum chelate of carminic acid.
233	00:17:20	00:17:21	Aluminum ch...?
234	00:17:22	00:17:23	I've never heard of this before.
235	00:17:23	00:17:24	It's a cochineal.
236	00:17:24	00:17:25	A what?
237	00:17:25	00:17:26	A cochineal.
238	00:17:26	00:17:27	They're scaled insects.
239	00:17:27	00:17:29	Carminic acid is found in their intestines.
240	00:17:29	00:17:32	It's bitter, so it discourages predators.
241	00:17:32	00:17:35	As a dye, it's been prized for centuries.
242	00:17:35	00:17:37	Since when did you become an insects expert?
243	00:17:37	00:17:39	Entomology textbook.
244	00:17:39	00:17:40	Grissom gave it to me last Christmas.
245	00:17:40	00:17:41	When I can't sleep, I read.
246	00:17:41	00:17:44	Funny, I didn't get a Christmas gift from Grissom.
247	00:17:44	00:17:45	Did you?
248	00:17:45	00:17:47	No.
249	00:17:47	00:17:52	Uh, so, assuming that she was tattooed in prison, how'd she get a hold of the bugs?
250	00:17:52	00:17:55	Well, um, cochineals feed on cactus plants.
251	00:17:55	00:17:58	They probably grow wild in the prison yard.
252	00:17:58	00:18:04	Baby Girl could've smashed up a few bugs, used the carminic acid to tattoo herself.
253	00:18:04	00:18:06	Do you have a photo of the tattoo?
254	00:18:06	00:18:08	Yeah.
255	00:18:13	00:18:16	Looks like a half moon.
256	00:18:16	00:18:18	Gang moniker, maybe.
257	00:18:18	00:18:20	Every woman knows what that is.
258	00:18:20	00:18:22	It's a heart.
259	00:18:22	00:18:24	Well, half a heart.
260	00:18:25	00:18:27	Oh.
261	00:18:27	00:18:29	Yeah.
262	00:18:29	00:18:31	Where's the other half?
263	00:18:35	00:18:40	Mr. Samuels, we found your prints on the knife used to kill Adanto Adams.
264	00:18:40	00:18:41	Now, wait a minute.
265	00:18:41	00:18:42	I didn't stab Adanto.
266	00:18:42	00:18:44	Oh, my God.
267	00:18:44	00:18:45	Zero?!
268	00:18:45	00:18:46	Zero?!
269	00:18:49	00:18:51	But you didn't call 911.
270	00:18:51	00:18:52	Or the police.
271	00:18:52	00:18:53	You just took off?
272	00:18:53	00:18:55	That's a felony.
273	00:18:55	00:18:57	Look, I was concerned about Zero.
274	00:18:57	00:19:00	He's a nine-year-old kid in a man's body.
275	00:19:00	00:19:02	I didn't know if he did it.
276	00:19:02	00:19:03	Zero's like a son to me.
277	00:19:03	00:19:05	I've been his guardian since he was 14.
278	00:19:06	00:19:07	Everybody used to make fun of him.
279	00:19:07	00:19:09	Called him Zero.
280	00:19:09	00:19:12	I told him only special people get nicknames.
281	00:19:12	00:19:14	Where's his parents now?
282	00:19:14	00:19:16	They passed away.
283	00:19:16	00:19:19	He left a small inheritance for his boys...
284	00:19:19	00:19:21	Zero doesn't spend much.
285	00:19:21	00:19:25	Okay, I'll ask again.
286	00:19:25	00:19:29	You found the body and then you went to work?
287	00:19:29	00:19:31	I just needed some time to think.
288	00:19:31	00:19:33	Well, you'll get plenty of that now.
289	00:19:33	00:19:35	24 hours in a holding cell.
290	00:19:35	00:19:36	Come on. Let's go.
291	00:19:36	00:19:38	It's very peculiar.
292	00:19:38	00:19:40	Take a look at his chest wound.
293	00:19:40	00:19:42	No right or left angulation.
294	00:19:42	00:19:43	No up or down.
295	00:19:43	00:19:45	Straight in, straight out.
296	00:19:45	00:19:52	Well, the crime scene suggests he was moving around his apartment while being stabbed so, straight in, straight out doesn't seem likely.
297	00:19:52	00:19:54	Well, one time is an anomaly.
298	00:19:54	00:19:55	Five times?
299	00:19:56	00:19:59	All four back wounds are clustered and parallel.
300	00:19:59	00:20:04	And the chest wound is at the same distance from the crown of his head as the other four.
301	00:20:04	00:20:06	What about defensive wounds?
302	00:20:06	00:20:07	There are none.
303	00:20:09	00:20:14	Okay, so, he's running around his apartment trying to get away from his attacker and he incurs no nicks or cuts?
304	00:20:14	00:20:15	Nope.
305	00:20:17	00:20:19	What else?
306	00:20:19	00:20:21	Well, I found this in his stomach.
307	00:20:21	00:20:23	Looks like a paper wad of some sort.
308	00:20:25	00:20:28	Maybe a treasure map.
309	00:20:28	00:20:34	Good thing this guy's not concerned with his cholesterol.
310	00:20:34	00:20:35	He ate fatty foods.
311	00:20:35	00:20:38	Paper's pretty well preserved.
312	00:20:38	00:20:42	Uh, most of the ink is washed off.
313	00:20:42	00:20:44	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
314	00:20:44	00:20:47	There's something there in the corner.
315	00:20:51	00:20:55	Help me put it in there, Warrick.
316	00:21:09	00:21:14	Uh... P-A... L...
317	00:21:14	00:21:17	Oh, The Palms.
318	00:21:17	00:21:19	I know what this is.
319	00:21:19	00:21:23	It's a receipt for a marker.
320	00:21:23	00:21:25	For ten grand.
321	00:21:28	00:21:29	Oh, yeah, that's him.
322	00:21:29	00:21:30	Adanto Adams.
323	00:21:30	00:21:32	Said he wanted to play BJ in the no-limit area.
324	00:21:32	00:21:34	So I had the cage check his credit.
325	00:21:34	00:21:36	Qualified for ten grand.
326	00:21:36	00:21:38	Thank you.
327	00:21:38	00:21:39	And I wrote him up.
328	00:21:39	00:21:40	Did he have some kind of a system?
329	00:21:40	00:21:42	They all got systems.
330	00:21:42	00:21:44	This one was a small-time double-up type thing.
331	00:21:44	00:21:45	Bet 100, lose; bet 200, lose.
332	00:21:45	00:21:46	Bet four, lose.
333	00:21:46	00:21:48	Double-up-till- you-win type thing.
334	00:21:55	00:21:57	Now, don't you get anything other than a 20?
335	00:21:57	00:21:58	Hmm?
336	00:22:00	00:22:05	The one thing about systems in this town-- if you got one, we want you here.
337	00:22:05	00:22:06	Can I get a copy of that footage?
338	00:22:06	00:22:08	Listen, you look familiar.
339	00:22:08	00:22:10	I seen you before?
340	00:22:10	00:22:11	You been in here?
341	00:22:11	00:22:13	Maybe just on a case.
342	00:22:13	00:22:15	How about that footage?
343	00:22:17	00:22:19	Hey, got your page. What's up?
344	00:22:19	00:22:23	Oh, the warden faxed over Baby Girl's commissary purchases.
345	00:22:23	00:22:30	She bought one 20-count box of tampons every month like clockwork, but check out the last few months.
346	00:22:30	00:22:31	What are you thinking?
347	00:22:32	00:22:35	She might not have needed any for, oh, nine months?
348	00:22:35	00:22:37	I think Baby Girl was having a baby.
349	00:22:41	00:22:44	Skull's not ready yet.
350	00:22:44	00:22:46	Enzymes are still eating away at the proteins.
351	00:22:47	00:22:51	Did you, by any chance, do a pregnancy test on Baby Girl?
352	00:22:51	00:22:55	I thought she'd been incarcerated for the last 23 months.
353	00:22:55	00:22:57	She had been.
354	00:23:06	00:23:10	Urine...
355	00:23:10	00:23:11	you're out.
356	00:23:12	00:23:14	Okay...
357	00:23:17	00:23:18	Home pregnancy test?
358	00:23:18	00:23:26	About ten times cheaper than the brand sold by our medical supply company, and just as accurate.
359	00:23:26	00:23:29	Eye on the bottom line.
360	00:23:29	00:23:30	I find that very...
361	00:23:30	00:23:32	Sexy?
362	00:23:32	00:23:33	Prudent.
363	00:23:33	00:23:35	But that was a good try.
364	00:23:35	00:23:39	Yeah, plus sign.
365	00:23:39	00:23:40	You know what that means.
366	00:23:40	00:23:43	Who's your daddy?
367	00:23:47	00:23:48	Archie?
368	00:23:48	00:23:49	Hey.
369	00:23:49	00:23:51	Got your surveillance tape of Zero's brother.
370	00:23:51	00:23:53	Roll it.
371	00:23:53	00:23:58	Now, according to the pit boss, the kid was playing a double-up system.
372	00:23:58	00:24:01	What I want to know is, how many hands did he back himself up?
373	00:24:01	00:24:02	Let's find out.
374	00:24:07	00:24:11	First hand, hundred. Loser.
375	00:24:11	00:24:15	Second hand, 200.
376	00:24:15	00:24:17	Lose.
377	00:24:17	00:24:20	Third hand, 400. Lose.
378	00:24:21	00:24:24	$800.
379	00:24:24	00:24:26	So he's doubling every bet.
380	00:24:26	00:24:29	Yeah, that's the classic double-up system.
381	00:24:33	00:24:35	Go back out wide.
382	00:24:37	00:24:40	Looks like he's all in.
383	00:24:40	00:24:44	Tenth bet, $51,200.
384	00:24:46	00:24:48	Adanto has 20.
385	00:24:48	00:24:49	He sticks.
386	00:24:49	00:24:50	She has two up.
387	00:24:51	00:24:54	Another two, and that's four.
388	00:24:54	00:24:55	Two, three, two.
389	00:24:55	00:24:56	That's 11.
390	00:24:56	00:25:00	Ace, ace, ace, ace.
391	00:25:00	00:25:02	Fifteen.
392	00:25:02	00:25:04	Six.
393	00:25:05	00:25:08	Ten-card 21.
394	00:25:08	00:25:10	What are the odds of that?
395	00:25:10	00:25:12	The record's an 11-card 21.
396	00:25:12	00:25:14	That was back in '78.
397	00:25:15	00:25:20	So he loses $102,300 in ten hands.
398	00:25:20	00:25:21	What's the $10,000 marker for?
399	00:25:25	00:25:27	Try to chase back the 102.
400	00:25:38	00:25:40	He lost it all.
401	00:25:47	00:25:50	He swallowed his loss.
402	00:25:51	00:25:54	All correctional officers report to reception.
403	00:25:54	00:25:56	All COs to reception.
404	00:25:58	00:25:59	Miss Willows.
405	00:26:00	00:26:02	My COs are Level 3 peace officers.
406	00:26:02	00:26:07	I will not subject them to a DNA lineup that is nothing more than a wild goose chase.
407	00:26:07	00:26:11	We have probable cause to believe that a correctional officer was involved with Baby Girl.
408	00:26:12	00:26:15	Involved in getting her pregnant, maybe, but that's a far cry from homicide.
409	00:26:15	00:26:21	Nevertheless, as you pointed out, sex with an inmate is a crime.
410	00:26:21	00:26:23	Which is the basis for my warrant.
411	00:26:28	00:26:31	Okay, everybody, can I have your attention, please?
412	00:26:32	00:26:34	Hey, I did some digging.
413	00:26:34	00:26:38	Withdrawal slip from Zero Adams' custodial account the day of the murder.
414	00:26:38	00:26:39	How much?
415	00:26:39	00:26:40	$102,000 even.
416	00:26:40	00:26:41	Who are the signatories?
417	00:26:41	00:26:44	Zero Adams and Frank Samuels.
418	00:26:44	00:26:46	Uh, this is not my signature.
419	00:26:46	00:26:48	This is Zero's account.
420	00:26:48	00:26:51	I'm the custodian, but, um, I didn't sign this.
421	00:26:51	00:26:53	Adanto.
422	00:26:53	00:26:54	That son of a...
423	00:26:54	00:26:55	What?
424	00:26:55	00:26:57	You knew about this?
425	00:26:57	00:26:58	Indirectly.
426	00:26:59	00:27:00	We had it out.
427	00:27:00	00:27:02	Tell you something, you degenerate.
428	00:27:02	00:27:07	All I've heard from you is how much money you blow day-trading, and now you want to touch your brother's life savings?
429	00:27:07	00:27:09	You can forget about it. Don't you see?
430	00:27:09	00:27:12	If I play perfect blackjack, there is no way we can lose...
431	00:27:12	00:27:13	There is no perfect blackjack.
432	00:27:13	00:27:17	I'm going to need, uh, a sample of...
433	00:27:17	00:27:19	of your handwriting.
434	00:27:19	00:27:21	Also need a sample from Zero.
435	00:27:22	00:27:24	Just copy this?
436	00:27:24	00:27:25	Yes.
437	00:27:43	00:27:47	London Letters is one of my favorite standard writing tests.
438	00:27:47	00:27:52	Uh, the paragraph has every capital letter in the alphabet, as well as numbers one through nine.
439	00:27:52	00:27:54	Just tell me who's lying.
440	00:27:54	00:27:56	Uh, okay. Uh, Zero's not.
441	00:27:56	00:27:58	Uh, his signature is authentic.
442	00:27:58	00:28:01	Proof is in the Z.
443	00:28:01	00:28:11	Okay, uh, look at the F in Frank Samuels from the withdrawal slip, and then look at the F from the London Letters.
444	00:28:11	00:28:12	Different.
445	00:28:13	00:28:19	As well as the S in Samuels, and the S in Switzerland.
446	00:28:21	00:28:23	Again, way off.
447	00:28:23	00:28:27	I hate to tell you, Warrick, but I think your guardian might be telling you the truth.
448	00:28:27	00:28:30	And from what I can see, Zero didn't forge it.
449	00:28:30	00:28:32	Well, then who did?
450	00:28:32	00:28:33	Adanto?
451	00:28:33	00:28:35	Without a sample, I can't tell you.
452	00:28:38	00:28:39	Start talking.
453	00:28:39	00:28:44	The blood Nick and Sara found in the back of the bus-- consistent with the victim.
454	00:28:44	00:28:45	Not a surprise.
455	00:28:45	00:28:49	Semen found in the back of the bus matches your bus driver's DNA.
456	00:28:49	00:28:51	Also, not a surprise.
457	00:28:51	00:28:52	Try this one.
458	00:28:52	00:28:57	Bus driver's DNA has 13 alleles in common with the victim's unborn fetus.
459	00:29:03	00:29:05	I don't believe you.
460	00:29:05	00:29:06	She was pregnant.
461	00:29:06	00:29:08	12 weeks.
462	00:29:08	00:29:10	And you're the father.
463	00:29:10	00:29:13	Your attorney has reviewed your case file.
464	00:29:13	00:29:15	It's in there.
465	00:29:17	00:29:24	When he said he expected something on top of his $11.65 an hour, I thought he was talking about free car washes.
466	00:29:24	00:29:27	There's no evidence of anti- or paramortem rape.
467	00:29:27	00:29:28	He'll claim it was consensual.
468	00:29:28	00:29:29	It's still rape.
469	00:29:29	00:29:32	Under color of authority.
470	00:29:32	00:29:34	She swore she couldn't have kids.
471	00:29:34	00:29:36	Too many turns at the coat hanger.
472	00:29:38	00:29:39	Her words.
473	00:29:40	00:29:41	Yeah.
474	00:29:41	00:29:46	I imagine that you were pissed off when she broke the news.
475	00:29:46	00:29:49	It kind of changes the power dynamics.
476	00:29:49	00:29:51	And she blabs to the warden.
477	00:29:51	00:29:54	He's demoted from officer to inmate.
478	00:29:54	00:29:56	That is motive.
479	00:29:56	00:29:58	I swear, I had no idea.
480	00:29:58	00:30:00	Doug, let me handle this.
481	00:30:00	00:30:04	If the DA had sufficient evidence to file murder charges, he would have.
482	00:30:04	00:30:06	Well, your client's already been charged with a felony.
483	00:30:07	00:30:08	DA has all the time in the world.
484	00:30:08	00:30:09	Look, I can't fight the evidence.
485	00:30:09	00:30:11	Doug, Doug, would you be quiet?
486	00:30:11	00:30:12	Look, I got her pregnant.
487	00:30:12	00:30:14	I admit it.
488	00:30:14	00:30:15	I'll do the time, okay?
489	00:30:15	00:30:18	But you can't prove that I killed her because I didn't.
490	00:30:25	00:30:27	How's the knife handle coming?
491	00:30:27	00:30:28	Handled.
492	00:30:28	00:30:33	The substance Grissom scraped off was interior latex house paint with titanium dioxide.
493	00:30:33	00:30:35	That would be glossy, right?
494	00:30:35	00:30:36	Mm-hmm.
495	00:30:36	00:30:38	What's house paint doing on a knife handle?
496	00:30:38	00:30:45	1984, William Bergstrom asked old man Binion if he could come into his casino and bet a million dollars on one roll of craps.
497	00:30:45	00:30:52	That November, he put a briefcase full of $1 million on the don't pass line, rolled a seven on the come-up.
498	00:30:52	00:30:53	Loser.
499	00:30:53	00:30:56	Soon after that, he killed himself.
500	00:30:56	00:30:57	So, what are you getting at?
501	00:30:57	00:31:03	If the wounds couldn't have been made by a handheld knife, maybe the knife wasn't handheld.
502	00:31:03	00:31:04	How else are you going to stab a guy?
503	00:31:04	00:31:07	Well, put the evidence aside for a second.
504	00:31:07	00:31:10	What was Adanto's state of mind?
505	00:31:10	00:31:11	You've had a few bad runs.
506	00:31:11	00:31:23	Guy comes into town, convinces his brother to invest in some two-bit double-up system, ends up losing his life savings in a ten-card 21.
507	00:31:23	00:31:25	desperate.
508	00:31:25	00:31:28	So put that into context with your evidence.
509	00:31:32	00:31:34	Greg.
510	00:31:34	00:31:39	Do you think skin cells can survive 50 miles of rough desert road?
511	00:31:39	00:31:40	That's what I asked you.
512	00:31:40	00:31:44	I analyzed every strip of fabric from the bus' chassis.
513	00:31:44	00:31:45	Zilch.
514	00:31:45	00:31:51	But I'm a guy who likes to tie up loose ends, so I asked Doc Robbins to send over the scraps that were tied to the body parts.
515	00:31:51	00:31:52	That's where I found them.
516	00:31:52	00:31:55	Fresh, abraded epithelials.
517	00:31:59	00:32:03	So, if the epithelial DNA matches the bus driver, this case is closed.
518	00:32:03	00:32:04	One problem.
519	00:32:04	00:32:06	Double X marks the spot.
520	00:32:07	00:32:08	It's female DNA?
521	00:32:08	00:32:11	Well, I guess we're looking at an inmate.
522	00:32:11	00:32:13	Or female staff.
523	00:32:13	00:32:14	Excuse me. Am I interrupting?
524	00:32:14	00:32:18	Oh, not if the vic's skull is in that bag.
525	00:32:18	00:32:21	Alas, poor Yorick.
526	00:32:21	00:32:22	I knew him, Horatio.
527	00:32:25	00:32:30	The occipital bone retained the shape of the murder weapon.
528	00:32:44	00:32:46	Desperation.
529	00:33:29	00:33:30	No way we can lose.
530	00:33:33	00:33:35	This is Vegas. Anything can happen.
531	00:33:52	00:33:55	I found a way to make us some money.
532	00:33:56	00:33:59	We're going to be rich like we always talked about.
533	00:33:59	00:34:01	I love you, kid.
534	00:34:01	00:34:03	I love you, too.
535	00:34:09	00:34:12	He killed himself?
536	00:34:14	00:34:16	I'm afraid so.
537	00:34:19	00:34:22	No. Why would he do that?
538	00:34:22	00:34:26	Your brother took out an insurance policy with an accidental death clause.
539	00:34:29	00:34:34	It means that if he was murdered, the beneficiary would be entitled to a million dollars.
540	00:34:34	00:34:35	You're the beneficiary.
541	00:34:36	00:34:41	Unfortunately, the coroner is going to rule the case a suicide...
542	00:34:41	00:34:46	and not a homicide, which makes that policy worthless.
543	00:34:46	00:34:49	I-I was just trying to help my brother.
544	00:34:51	00:34:54	Oh... I want Frank.
545	00:34:54	00:34:55	Listen to me.
546	00:34:55	00:34:57	Frank will be facing charges of obstructing justice.
547	00:34:57	00:34:58	Do you understand?
548	00:34:58	00:35:01	The court will appoint you another guardian.
549	00:35:01	00:35:02	No, I don't want another guardian.
550	00:35:02	00:35:04	I want Frank!
551	00:35:08	00:35:11	I'm sorry.
552	00:35:26	00:35:33	This program is scanning the topography of the skull and building a three-dimensional image based on the data.
553	00:35:33	00:35:40	It should be done in a second, but you can already see two concentric arcs.
554	00:35:40	00:35:44	Inner arc is impressed just a little bit deeper into the skull.
555	00:35:44	00:35:46	Check it out.
556	00:35:46	00:35:48	Like a crater in a crater. Yeah.
557	00:35:48	00:35:50	Can you enlarge to full screen?
558	00:35:55	00:35:57	There.
559	00:35:58	00:36:04	Small... evenly spaced indentations on the edge of the inner arc.
560	00:36:04	00:36:05	I know what that is.
561	00:36:13	00:36:16	Skinny-ass feather worth as much trouble dead as she was alive?
562	00:36:16	00:36:20	I didn't ask her to move in here. No one asked you.
563	00:36:25	00:36:29	So, Warden, Baby Girl was transferred to this cell about a week ago?
564	00:36:29	00:36:31	That's right.
565	00:36:31	00:36:33	Where was she last housed?
566	00:36:33	00:36:34	D block.
567	00:36:51	00:36:53	White fibers.
568	00:36:58	00:37:03	Warden, how often do the inmates have their laundry washed?
569	00:37:04	00:37:06	one day for colors, one day for whites.
570	00:37:07	00:37:08	Tomorrow's a white day.
571	00:37:12	00:37:16	You don't mind if I empty out your laundry bag, do you?
572	00:37:28	00:37:31	Juanita, would you remove your shoes, please?
573	00:37:33	00:37:35	Now.
574	00:37:45	00:37:46	The other.
575	00:38:11	00:38:15	A lock in a sock.
576	00:38:22	00:38:24	Juanita, I read your rap sheet.
577	00:38:24	00:38:28	Possession with intent to sell.
578	00:38:28	00:38:33	Your old man was using you as a drug meal, right?
579	00:38:35	00:38:38	He was supposed to protect me.
580	00:38:39	00:38:44	He said if I got caught, he'd take the fall.
581	00:38:44	00:38:48	After the raid, he disappeared.
582	00:38:49	00:38:51	Vanished.
583	00:38:51	00:38:54	I get locked up.
584	00:38:54	00:38:55	I should've known better.
585	00:38:58	00:39:00	Well...
586	00:39:00	00:39:03	my ex drained my bank account.
587	00:39:03	00:39:09	I was saving up for this nice little house for my daughter and me, and...
588	00:39:11	00:39:14	As soon as you let 'em in, huh?
589	00:39:25	00:39:27	Gets lonely in prison, doesn't it?
590	00:39:27	00:39:31	Was it the first time you had a relationship with a woman?
591	00:39:32	00:39:34	Tattoo.
592	00:39:34	00:39:37	Baby Girl had the other half.
593	00:39:37	00:39:40	I'm not... like that.
594	00:39:40	00:39:44	It wouldn't be the first time to cross gender lines in search of some...
595	00:39:44	00:39:46	affection.
596	00:39:46	00:39:50	It was the first time I felt that way about anyone.
597	00:39:50	00:39:52	And Baby Girl ended up pregnant.
598	00:39:52	00:39:55	It's not like she could hide that from you.
599	00:39:55	00:39:57	She said she had the flu.
600	00:39:57	00:39:59	Yeah, right.
601	00:39:59	00:40:04	( gagging ) That's what you get for lying to me, for sneaking around.
602	00:40:04	00:40:06	I was just playing him, Juana.
603	00:40:06	00:40:08	I was doing it for us.
604	00:40:08	00:40:09	You're a liar!
605	00:40:09	00:40:11	Want to know the truth, Juanita?
606	00:40:11	00:40:15	In one month, I am out of this hole...
607	00:40:15	00:40:17	and away from you.
608	00:40:17	00:40:24	And then, later that night, she said she was sorry, and we made up.
609	00:40:24	00:40:28	The next day, she got the warden to transfer her...
610	00:40:28	00:40:30	out of our cell.
611	00:40:30	00:40:33	She wasn't playing Doug.
612	00:40:33	00:40:35	She was playing me.
613	00:40:35	00:40:37	So you killed her?
614	00:40:37	00:40:40	She promised to end it with Doug.
615	00:41:13	00:41:23	You tied her body to the undercarriage of the bus and assumed we'd think that she died while attempting to escape... right?
616	00:41:24	00:41:27	If there's one thing I learned in prison...
617	00:41:27	00:41:30	it's to stick up for myself...
618	00:41:30	00:41:33	because nobody else will.
619	00:41:35	00:41:41	I think that you should know that Baby Girl was telling the truth about the transfer.
620	00:41:41	00:41:42	It wasn't her request.
621	00:41:42	00:41:46	It was Warden Hutton's decision.
622	00:41:46	00:41:53	She was caught trying to smuggle in this necklace and was reprimanded.
623	00:41:53	00:41:57	I'm guessing it was for you.
