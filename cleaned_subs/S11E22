0	00:00:06	00:00:07	Cops found a body.
1	00:00:07	00:00:09	Where? L.A.
2	00:00:09	00:00:10	Ray, we'll find Gloria.
3	00:00:10	00:00:12	It's been 72 hours.
4	00:00:12	00:00:14	That means she's already gone.
5	00:00:14	00:00:17	She's still alive! Gloria's still alive, Ray!
6	00:00:17	00:00:18	I don't think that you should be here.
7	00:00:18	00:00:20	You're going back to Vegas.
8	00:00:20	00:00:22	This sick bastard's leaving us a bread crumb trail.
9	00:00:22	00:00:23	Request immediate backup.
10	00:00:23	00:00:26	My location-- the old Thorpe farm.
11	00:00:36	00:00:38	Welcome home, Ray.
12	00:00:38	00:00:40	Glad you could make the family reunion.
13	00:00:40	00:00:42	I assume you met Dad.
14	00:00:42	00:00:45	He knew you were here the whole time. He was protecting you?
15	00:00:45	00:00:48	He's never protected me in my life, Ray.
16	00:00:48	00:00:50	Never knew me, never knew my genius.
17	00:00:50	00:00:54	Had no idea of my extraordinary, uh, uh, accomplishments.
18	00:00:54	00:00:57	So when he came home, I gave him a little show-and-tell.
19	00:00:57	00:00:58	Now I'm wearing the pants.
20	00:00:58	00:01:02	You don't become a real man until you take that first swing at dad.
21	00:01:02	00:01:04	Oh, you know me so well, Ray.
22	00:01:04	00:01:07	Except with me, it's many swings, many dads.
23	00:01:07	00:01:10	Many, many-- Ray!
24	00:01:10	00:01:14	Careful. I've gotten very good with this.
25	00:01:14	00:01:16	I don't think you want to shoot me, Warner.
26	00:01:16	00:01:18	I think you need me too much.
27	00:01:18	00:01:21	These last few kills-- the thrill is gone.
28	00:01:21	00:01:23	And I blame you. No.
29	00:01:23	00:01:25	You never forget your first, right?
30	00:01:27	00:01:29	Tell me, who is Nate Haskell?
31	00:01:29	00:01:30	You're digging, Ray.
32	00:01:30	00:01:37	You're digging, and you're gonna keep digging for a long time, because the ghosts in this house have finally stopped talking.
33	00:01:37	00:01:38	Right, Dad?
34	00:01:42	00:01:44	Hey, come on, Ray. Huh?
35	00:01:47	00:01:49	Come on, Ray!
36	00:01:54	00:01:56	What's the matter, Ray?
37	00:01:56	00:01:57	We're just getting started.
38	00:01:57	00:02:00	No. We're done.
39	00:02:13	00:02:14	You're all right, Gloria.
40	00:02:14	00:02:16	You're gonna be fine.
41	00:02:21	00:02:23	I'm disappointed in you, Ray.
42	00:02:23	00:02:29	I told you, we share something very special.
43	00:02:29	00:02:31	I told you, we're nothing alike.
44	00:02:31	00:02:35	Aren't you curious, Ray?
45	00:02:35	00:02:37	Don't you wonder why she's still alive?
46	00:02:37	00:02:40	Ask her what I did to her.
47	00:02:55	00:02:57	Yeah.
48	00:02:57	00:03:00	Ask.
49	00:03:21	00:03:30	Captain? Cover the back.
50	00:04:41	00:04:43	The suspect's on the first floor.
51	00:04:43	00:04:46	He's down. Proceed with caution.
52	00:04:46	00:04:47	You guys secure down here.
53	00:04:47	00:04:48	I'm gonna head up and join Brass.
54	00:04:48	00:04:49	Got it. Copy that.
55	00:04:49	00:04:50	Gloria... Mm?
56	00:04:50	00:04:52	It's over.
57	00:04:52	00:04:55	I'm not going to leave you.
58	00:04:55	00:04:57	Just gonna get you to the hospital now.
59	00:04:59	00:05:02	Everything's going to be fine.
60	00:05:02	00:05:04	Ray, listen to me.
61	00:05:04	00:05:06	You don't say anything...
62	00:05:06	00:05:08	to anyone, get it?
63	00:05:08	00:05:11	Nothing, nobody.
64	00:05:19	00:05:21	Mitch, Akers-- meet me out front?
65	00:05:21	00:05:24	Copy. I have the car standing by.
66	00:05:29	00:05:30	Put him in the car.
67	00:05:30	00:05:32	Nobody talks to him. That's an order.
68	00:05:32	00:05:34	Yep. Got it, Captain.
69	00:05:52	00:05:56	This is Metro holding Code Three to Desert Palm Hospital.
70	00:05:56	00:05:57	Ray!
71	00:06:07	00:06:11	We chased Haskell from Vegas to L.A. and back and end up finding him here.
72	00:06:11	00:06:13	Home?!
73	00:06:13	00:06:17	This house is owned by Arvin Thorpe, the farmer from across the street.
74	00:06:17	00:06:22	Langston discovered that Haskell's real name is Warner Thorpe.
75	00:06:22	00:06:24	That makes Haskell the farmer's son?
76	00:06:24	00:06:25	The farmer must have been lying to us.
77	00:06:25	00:06:27	Well, he's still lying...
78	00:06:27	00:06:29	upstairs with a bullet in him.
79	00:06:31	00:06:33	Face up.
80	00:06:33	00:06:36	Came through the banister and landed here.
81	00:06:36	00:06:37	Backwards.
82	00:06:37	00:06:39	Took a beating beforehand.
83	00:06:39	00:06:42	Blunt force trauma, nose is broken.
84	00:06:42	00:06:44	Thank God Ray's okay.
85	00:06:44	00:06:46	They duked it out; Ray won.
86	00:06:46	00:06:48	It's a classic case of self-defense.
87	00:06:48	00:06:51	We all know the history of this.
88	00:06:51	00:06:53	Internal Affairs is going to be all over it.
89	00:06:53	00:06:55	We need to give Ray all the help we can.
90	00:06:55	00:06:56	I'll be outside.
91	00:07:04	00:07:06	You never forget your first.
92	00:07:06	00:07:10	Haskell left the same message for Langston in Tina Vincent's room in L.A.
93	00:07:10	00:07:13	Trail leads upstairs.
94	00:07:13	00:07:15	Tickets to the fight.
95	00:07:15	00:07:17	Ray was lured here.
96	00:07:17	00:07:20	Haskell's house. Home field advantage.
97	00:07:20	00:07:22	I guess Ray had more to fight for.
98	00:07:23	00:07:25	Trauma's prepped and ready, Doctor.
99	00:07:25	00:07:28	You're going to be okay, Gloria.
100	00:07:28	00:07:30	You hear me?
101	00:07:30	00:07:31	You're gonna be just fine.
102	00:07:31	00:07:33	You hear me?
103	00:07:34	00:07:36	You're gonna be all right.
104	00:07:36	00:07:38	Dr. Langston, you have to let her go.
105	00:07:38	00:07:41	I promise, we're going to take good care of her.
106	00:07:41	00:07:42	Ray...
107	00:07:42	00:07:45	thank God you're all right.
108	00:07:45	00:07:50	You know, I'd give you a hug right now, but unfortunately, you're evidence, if you know what I mean.
109	00:07:50	00:07:51	I understand. I understand.
110	00:07:52	00:07:55	I need to be in there with Gloria.
111	00:07:55	00:07:57	Ray, we've got to do this by the book.
112	00:07:58	00:08:02	I'll process Gloria, and Nick will take your clothes.
113	00:08:25	00:08:26	You saved her life, Ray.
114	00:08:27	00:08:29	That's all that matters.
115	00:08:36	00:08:39	What is this?
116	00:08:43	00:08:46	I don't know.
117	00:08:50	00:08:53	All right.
118	00:08:53	00:08:55	I'm going to need your clothes there, too, bud.
119	00:08:55	00:08:58	All right.
120	00:09:04	00:09:06	Jim?
121	00:09:06	00:09:07	I.A.'s already here.
122	00:09:07	00:09:09	No, in your office.
123	00:09:09	00:09:11	You still out at the Thorpe house?
124	00:09:11	00:09:13	Okay. No, no, no, I'll handle it.
125	00:09:13	00:09:14	I.A. works for me.
126	00:09:14	00:09:18	Being boss should be good for something. Yeah.
127	00:09:18	00:09:23	Detective Schulz, Brass is, uh, still out at the scene.
128	00:09:23	00:09:24	Figure we could start without him.
129	00:09:24	00:09:25	Probably finish, too.
130	00:09:25	00:09:27	This is all going to be pretty straightforward.
131	00:09:27	00:09:29	Always tricky to estimate that, isn't it?
132	00:09:29	00:09:34	Simpler these officer-involved cases look, the more surprises seem to pop up.
133	00:09:34	00:09:39	I've seen plenty of claims of self-defense turn out to be cold-blooded murder and a life sentence in Ely.
134	00:09:39	00:09:41	When do I talk to CSI Langston?
135	00:09:41	00:09:43	Well, let's give the guy a couple days.
136	00:09:43	00:09:45	He's been through the wringer in two cities...
137	00:09:45	00:09:47	You saying you want to delay?
138	00:09:47	00:09:50	We all want to put this to bed, Detective, Langston included.
139	00:09:50	00:09:52	Who wouldn't, in his situation?
140	00:09:52	00:09:53	You'll get your interview.
141	00:09:53	00:09:56	Thanks for coming in.
142	00:09:57	00:10:00	Got it.
143	00:10:04	00:10:07	So, Haskell traveled approximately 132 inches.
144	00:10:07	00:10:09	Let her rip, Dave.
145	00:10:09	00:10:10	Yeah.
146	00:10:13	00:10:15	This wood is thick.
147	00:10:15	00:10:17	Took a lot of force.
148	00:10:35	00:10:37	Contusion on the back.
149	00:10:37	00:10:40	Looks about the same width as the railing.
150	00:10:40	00:10:42	Guys like Haskell don't go down easy.
151	00:10:47	00:10:50	Single penetrating GSW to Dad's head.
152	00:10:50	00:10:51	Multiple lacerations.
153	00:10:51	00:10:54	Scabbed over.
154	00:10:54	00:10:57	Dad took a beating at least an hour before he died.
155	00:10:57	00:11:01	Got a baker's dozen of stab wounds to the abdomen.
156	00:11:03	00:11:07	A lot of this blood could be explained by Dad's injuries.
157	00:11:07	00:11:10	Contributions could be from Gloria and Langston, too.
158	00:11:10	00:11:12	Some of it's got to be from Haskell.
159	00:11:12	00:11:15	More than some, given the condition of his face.
160	00:11:17	00:11:19	Shoot, sample, sort.
161	00:13:51	00:13:53	Oh, God.
162	00:14:00	00:14:05	You're going to make it through this, Gloria.
163	00:14:05	00:14:07	You survived.
164	00:14:07	00:14:11	He's dead and you're not.
165	00:14:11	00:14:14	You beat him.
166	00:14:20	00:14:22	Nine-mil.
167	00:14:24	00:14:26	Gun Haskell used to shoot Dad?
168	00:14:26	00:14:28	And Tina Vincent in L.A., I bet.
169	00:14:28	00:14:30	It's empty.
170	00:14:30	00:14:31	Only one round in Dad.
171	00:14:31	00:14:34	Other shots fired at Langston and Gloria?
172	00:14:34	00:14:43	We can't talk to them until after they talk to I.A., but we can let the walls talk, look for bullet holes, cartridge casings.
173	00:14:51	00:14:54	This wallpaper is covering something.
174	00:14:56	00:14:57	Old blood.
175	00:15:00	00:15:01	It's kids' wallpaper.
176	00:15:01	00:15:05	I think this was Haskell's boyhood room.
177	00:15:07	00:15:11	Yeah, there is a lot of blood.
178	00:15:11	00:15:13	Medium velocity, heavier drops from castoff.
179	00:15:13	00:15:20	Nate Haskell might have died in this house, but I think a serial killer was born in this room.
180	00:15:35	00:15:38	So this is where the S.O.B. grew up?
181	00:15:40	00:15:43	First sample's not human.
182	00:15:43	00:15:45	He did say his first kill was a cat.
183	00:15:45	00:15:50	Serials love to start with animals, move on to human victims.
184	00:15:50	00:15:53	You know, kids don't wallpaper their own rooms.
185	00:15:53	00:15:57	At the very least, Dad knew what his son was up to in here.
186	00:15:57	00:15:59	Maybe he was up to it with him.
187	00:15:59	00:16:00	He never called the cops.
188	00:16:00	00:16:02	Maybe they shared hobbies.
189	00:16:02	00:16:06	Langston might have been up against more than one killer.
190	00:16:06	00:16:09	Greg's checking out the master bedroom now.
191	00:16:17	00:16:20	The Thorpes didn't even paper over the carnage in this room.
192	00:16:20	00:16:25	They didn't even repaint it, just washed all the blood away.
193	00:16:27	00:16:29	Or so they thought.
194	00:16:29	00:16:31	What the hell went on in this house?
195	00:16:31	00:16:37	Whatever it was, Arvin Thorpe didn't want anyone poking around here.
196	00:16:37	00:16:45	He bought this house in 1958, listed it as his primary residence until '76, when he bought the house across the road and moved in there.
197	00:16:45	00:16:49	Then lived there till his last lying day.
198	00:16:49	00:16:53	Yeah, but he never rented this place out, never sold it.
199	00:16:53	00:16:55	Guy like Arvin-- this property was keeping all his secrets.
200	00:16:55	00:17:03	All this old blood, father and son killers-- the more bodies we find around here, the better it is for Ray.
201	00:17:05	00:17:08	Why don't you and Sara keep working the current case analysis?
202	00:17:08	00:17:10	I'll have Catherine send me over some help.
203	00:17:10	00:17:14	Floors, walls, basement, yard-- I'm gonna rip this hellhole apart.
204	00:17:15	00:17:22	Gloria is clearly suffering acute traumatic stress-- alert but not making eye contact, not communicating.
205	00:17:22	00:17:23	No, no, no, no, no. I'm monitoring for tachycardia.
206	00:17:23	00:17:25	You do not talk to him.
207	00:17:25	00:17:29	He is not her husband.
208	00:17:29	00:17:33	You do not talk to him about my daughter.
209	00:17:33	00:17:35	What did he tell you, that he's a doctor, too?
210	00:17:35	00:17:36	Well, he's not.
211	00:17:36	00:17:41	He is nothing to my daughter but the one responsible for all of this.
212	00:17:41	00:17:47	Mrs. Parkes, why don't we take this somewhere...? Get security and get him out of here.
213	00:17:47	00:17:49	He's the one that did this to her.
214	00:17:49	00:17:52	He's the one that brought this monster into her life.
215	00:17:52	00:17:55	You did this to her.
216	00:17:55	00:17:57	Nora... Go!
217	00:17:57	00:17:59	Get out of my sight.
218	00:18:08	00:18:12	I am taking my daughter back to Baltimore with me.
219	00:18:12	00:18:15	I have already arranged the transportation.
220	00:18:15	00:18:16	Let's talk about the best timetable...
221	00:18:16	00:18:20	I am taking my daughter home!
222	00:18:21	00:18:27	Got the DNA reports from all the blood we sampled in the hallway.
223	00:18:27	00:18:31	I figure we color-code each of the blood donors.
224	00:18:33	00:18:38	Blue for Langston, green for Gloria, orange for Arvin Thorpe.
225	00:18:38	00:18:40	And Haskell's yellow-- perfect.
226	00:19:12	00:19:14	It's almost all Haskell's blood.
227	00:19:14	00:19:19	You collected a chunk of Haskell's scalp with a hair from right here.
228	00:19:19	00:19:22	Blood spatter from Haskell on the adjacent section of wall.
229	00:19:22	00:19:24	Langston had Haskell on his back.
230	00:19:24	00:19:27	Ground or pounded his head into the floor.
231	00:19:27	00:19:29	So Ray got a few good blows in.
232	00:19:32	00:19:36	Just because Langston had Haskell on the floor doesn't mean that he had him under control.
233	00:19:37	00:19:44	Langston's shoe prints in Haskell's blood heading to the spot where Haskell went through the banister?
234	00:19:44	00:19:46	Stomping through blood that was already on the floor.
235	00:19:46	00:19:48	Yeah, but it was only Langston's shoe prints.
236	00:19:48	00:19:55	Tangled up with Haskell, battling him back towards the banister, Haskell would have stepped into the same blood.
237	00:19:55	00:19:57	Langston had him off his feet.
238	00:19:57	00:19:59	He drove him towards the banister.
239	00:20:02	00:20:06	Maybe Haskell still had the gun and jumped Langston.
240	00:20:06	00:20:08	Langston did what he had to do.
241	00:20:08	00:20:09	He was fighting for his life.
242	00:20:09	00:20:13	Greg, if, if we were talking about two anonymous people locked in a fight...
243	00:20:13	00:20:14	I'd still say it was a fight.
244	00:20:14	00:20:21	Fights are unpredictable, anything can happen. Yeah, but one person can utterly dominate the other, have full control over them and throw them to their death.
245	00:20:21	00:20:28	I-I'm not saying that that's what happened-- and we both know that Haskell was a monster-- but we're looking for the truth here...
246	00:20:28	00:20:30	right?
247	00:20:37	00:20:39	Any bodies yet?
248	00:20:39	00:20:40	Hey.
249	00:20:40	00:20:48	So far, just a few family pets who lost the owner lottery-- two cats and a dog, no collars, no way to date 'em-- and these graves progress in size.
250	00:20:48	00:20:51	I got a bad feeling about a couple of those.
251	00:20:51	00:20:53	I got something.
252	00:20:54	00:20:56	Neither Rex nor Fluffy.
253	00:20:59	00:21:02	It's human.
254	00:21:04	00:21:06	You guys are going to need a hand here.
255	00:21:06	00:21:09	I've still got my kit in my car; let me grab it.
256	00:21:11	00:21:13	That's the spirit.
257	00:21:15	00:21:17	CSI Willows.
258	00:21:17	00:21:19	Detective, what are you doing here?
259	00:21:19	00:21:21	Paying my respects; surprised I was the first one.
260	00:21:21	00:21:24	Is that your unofficial way of asking for my team's report?
261	00:21:24	00:21:26	I can make it official.
262	00:21:26	00:21:29	You will get it when we're done processing all the evidence.
263	00:21:29	00:21:31	We've been down this road before-- Warrick Brown, now Ray Langston.
264	00:21:31	00:21:32	I talked to LAPD.
265	00:21:32	00:21:33	Your guy bought a gun.
266	00:21:33	00:21:36	For all I know, he slapped around Tina Vincent.
267	00:21:36	00:21:38	I don't think he'd hesitate to kill Nate Haskell.
268	00:21:38	00:21:40	I think you're getting ahead of the evidence.
269	00:21:40	00:21:41	Well, I'm ahead of you.
270	00:21:41	00:21:43	See for yourself.
271	00:21:48	00:21:51	Your friend Schulz was just here.
272	00:21:51	00:21:53	Yeah, I had the pleasure.
273	00:21:53	00:21:55	So what do we have?
274	00:21:55	00:22:00	Well, Dad here was maybe Haskell's one justifiable murder.
275	00:22:00	00:22:07	Haskell had long- healed bone traumas-- ribs, fibula, tibia, spiral breaks-- indicative of childhood abuse.
276	00:22:07	00:22:09	But his father didn't put him on this table.
277	00:22:09	00:22:10	Langston did.
278	00:22:10	00:22:14	Catherine, if it were my wife tied up in that room, I'll tell you...
279	00:22:14	00:22:15	Doc, I get it.
280	00:22:15	00:22:17	But is that how you think Schulz is going to look at this?
281	00:22:17	00:22:19	Ray killed someone.
282	00:22:19	00:22:22	I need to know it was the only way, the right way.
283	00:22:22	00:22:26	Tell me there's something on this body that's going to make this case.
284	00:22:26	00:22:35	Okay. Nate Haskell died as a result of atlanto-occipital disarticulation, consistent with his position of impact on the stairs.
285	00:22:35	00:22:42	Prior to death, he endured multiple blunt force traumas to his face and body as you would see in a serious fist fight.
286	00:22:42	00:22:45	Well, Haskell fell backwards through the railing, and landed on his back.
287	00:22:45	00:22:47	How did he shatter his knee?
288	00:22:47	00:22:50	Could be from the fall, could be from the fight.
289	00:22:52	00:22:54	And the kidney is severely damaged.
290	00:22:54	00:22:56	Is that from the fall, too?
291	00:22:56	00:22:58	Or the fight?
292	00:22:58	00:23:00	Either way, I'd call it karma, wouldn't you?
293	00:23:00	00:23:04	Doc, my opinion is not what we should be worried about right now.
294	00:23:06	00:23:10	I found a couple of marks on his wrists that I can't explain.
295	00:23:10	00:23:11	Is this from the handcuffs?
296	00:23:11	00:23:15	Not consistent with Brass's two-rail metal cuffs that were on the body when I received it.
297	00:23:15	00:23:20	Okay, so, Haskell was cuffed or bound by something else.
298	00:23:20	00:23:22	By someone else.
299	00:23:22	00:23:24	Did Schulz see this?
300	00:23:24	00:23:26	I'll tell what I told Schulz.
301	00:23:26	00:23:32	These marks, the knee, the kidney damage-- none of it affects the conclusions of my C.O.D.
302	00:23:32	00:23:34	I'm going to go get some air.
303	00:23:57	00:24:00	Gloria's SAE report came in.
304	00:24:02	00:24:05	It's on the table, but you don't want to look at that, Ray.
305	00:24:11	00:24:13	I need to, Catherine.
306	00:25:08	00:25:11	Small mandible, wide pelvis.
307	00:25:11	00:25:12	Adult female.
308	00:25:12	00:25:14	Color matches the surrounding dirt.
309	00:25:14	00:25:16	She's been here at least a decade.
310	00:25:17	00:25:19	Skull's crushed in.
311	00:25:19	00:25:21	That's not really Haskell's style.
312	00:25:21	00:25:22	Killer's style develops.
313	00:25:22	00:25:25	This may be an early rough draft.
314	00:25:25	00:25:27	What do you got, David?
315	00:25:29	00:25:31	Adult male.
316	00:25:33	00:25:34	Polyester?
317	00:25:34	00:25:36	'70s, maybe?
318	00:25:36	00:25:38	Pockets are empty.
319	00:25:39	00:25:41	Supra Lux. What's that?
320	00:25:41	00:25:44	My grandma had a pink oven with that logo on it.
321	00:25:44	00:25:46	Wait a sec.
322	00:25:46	00:25:56	Long before point-and-click shopping, even before washed-up celebs hawked skin cream on late-night TV, sales was a ground war, and the foot soldiers were traveling salesmen.
323	00:25:56	00:26:03	Sometimes, to show you just how cool their product was, salesmen would come knocking at your door armed with a salesman's sample.
324	00:26:03	00:26:05	A little, semi-working model of the product.
325	00:26:07	00:26:08	Supra-Lux.
326	00:26:08	00:26:11	I noticed it when we were in here earlier.
327	00:26:11	00:26:21	So, you think some time in the late '70s, a salesman knocks on this door, and Nate Haskell, or Warner Thorpe, kills him, and then takes this little toy fridge as his first souvenir?
328	00:26:21	00:26:23	Yeah, only he didn't just take his model.
329	00:26:26	00:26:28	He took his name.
330	00:26:47	00:26:48	Hey, Doc. Hey.
331	00:26:48	00:26:57	So... this is Douglas Nathan Haskell, reported missing in 1976, by his wife Elaine.
332	00:26:57	00:27:00	He was on a Supra-Lux sales swing through Southern Nevada.
333	00:27:00	00:27:05	DNA is a match to some of the old blood we found in Nate's childhood bedroom.
334	00:27:05	00:27:09	We were also able to recover DNA off of our female skeleton's molar.
335	00:27:09	00:27:11	And as you can see there, we ran that.
336	00:27:11	00:27:14	Hey.
337	00:27:14	00:27:15	Hey.
338	00:27:17	00:27:20	So, all of these were found in his backyard.
339	00:27:20	00:27:23	Whoa. All right, who are they?
340	00:27:23	00:27:25	This one gave him his name.
341	00:27:26	00:27:28	This one gave him life.
342	00:27:28	00:27:29	Mother. Yeah.
343	00:27:29	00:27:33	That's Lois Thorpe. She worked as an aid in an elementary school.
344	00:27:33	00:27:36	One day in 1968, she just didn't show up for work.
345	00:27:36	00:27:38	So, the principal called the police, filed a report.
346	00:27:38	00:27:40	Arvin said she ran off.
347	00:27:40	00:27:43	Multiple fractures to her skull.
348	00:27:43	00:27:45	Healed sternal fractures.
349	00:27:45	00:27:47	Posterior rib fractures.
350	00:27:47	00:27:50	Beaten to death after a long prelude of abuse.
351	00:27:50	00:27:54	She's a DNA match to blood we found in the Thorpe master bedroom.
352	00:27:54	00:27:58	Now, if she died in 1968, the boy would have only been eight years old?
353	00:27:58	00:28:01	And incapable of beating his mother to death.
354	00:28:01	00:28:03	So, Father killed Mother.
355	00:28:03	00:28:14	The wall spattered with themom's blood was right on the other side of the little boy's room, so he had to have heard those beatings over and over again.
356	00:28:18	00:28:28	These animal skeletons exhibit a mix of violent method. Some of the skeletons complete, unharmed, possibly suffocation deaths.
357	00:28:28	00:28:32	The others-- their bones crushed into tiny pieces.
358	00:28:32	00:28:34	Standard serial killer evolution.
359	00:28:34	00:28:37	In 1976, he graduated to humans.
360	00:28:37	00:28:42	At 16 years old, Warner Thorpe meets Douglas Nathan Haskell, a traveling appliance salesman.
361	00:28:47	00:28:48	Hello.
362	00:28:54	00:28:58	Soon after, Warner Thorpe just stopped showing up for school.
363	00:29:06	00:29:09	And Nate Haskell is unleashed on the world.
364	00:29:09	00:29:11	I.A. is on our ass.
365	00:29:11	00:29:12	They want the report.
366	00:29:12	00:29:14	Do we know what happened between Langston and Haskell?
367	00:29:14	00:29:16	Well...
368	00:29:16	00:29:19	um...
369	00:29:19	00:29:22	the blood evidence says that Langston dominated in the fight.
370	00:29:22	00:29:24	He had Haskell on his back.
371	00:29:24	00:29:26	He even had him off his feet at one point.
372	00:29:26	00:29:28	He carried him to the banister.
373	00:29:28	00:29:33	So, reasonably, Langston should have been able to subdue him, to restrain him, to cuff him.
374	00:29:35	00:29:38	There were marks on Haskell's wrists.
375	00:29:38	00:29:42	I compared the abrasions to the department-issued flex-cuffs.
376	00:29:44	00:29:50	Are you suggesting that Langston cuffed Haskell, shoved him through the railing, and then cut the restraints off?
377	00:29:50	00:29:54	Greg and I didn't find any flex-cuffs at the scene.
378	00:29:54	00:30:01	Well, the banister left a continuous and unbroken contusion across Haskell's back, so his arms weren't behind his back.
379	00:30:01	00:30:06	There was nothing between that banister and his back when he hit it.
380	00:30:06	00:30:08	Suggests he wasn't cuffed.
381	00:30:08	00:30:10	There is another possibility.
382	00:30:10	00:30:15	Langston could have cut the cuffs off Haskell before throwing him through the railing.
383	00:30:15	00:30:17	There were no cuffs found at the scene.
384	00:30:17	00:30:24	And if we let the evidence speak, it's telling us, no cuffs present, no cuffs used.
385	00:30:35	00:30:37	Mrs. Parkes?
386	00:30:37	00:30:40	I'm Catherine Willows with the Crime Lab.
387	00:30:40	00:30:41	You work with Ray.
388	00:30:41	00:30:43	Yes.
389	00:30:43	00:30:44	What are you doing here?
390	00:30:44	00:30:50	I'm the one that processed your daughter when she arrived here.
391	00:30:50	00:30:52	I just wanted to check on how she's doing.
392	00:30:52	00:30:55	You want to ask her questions, you want her to relive it.
393	00:30:55	00:30:57	That's what you people do.
394	00:30:57	00:31:01	Well, she's not talking, so please, just go.
395	00:31:01	00:31:10	Mrs. Parkes, my job is not to make anyone relive their nightmares, but sometimes I'm left with a few questions.
396	00:31:10	00:31:14	I just need a minute with Gloria.
397	00:31:14	00:31:17	Eight years old.
398	00:31:18	00:31:22	She made a list of all the big places she was going to play music.
399	00:31:22	00:31:25	And she made it all come true.
400	00:31:26	00:31:28	She could have done anything she wanted.
401	00:31:34	00:31:36	Do you know why their marriage ended?
402	00:31:36	00:31:41	Because Ray was afraid to have a baby with her.
403	00:31:41	00:31:43	Not just nerves.
404	00:31:43	00:31:50	Fear that something bad inside him would be passed on.
405	00:31:50	00:31:53	That man has always scared me.
406	00:31:55	00:31:57	Doesn't he scare you?
407	00:32:13	00:32:16	Gloria? Mm.
408	00:32:16	00:32:18	I just wanted to ask...
409	00:32:20	00:32:23	...if you were doing okay.
410	00:32:24	00:32:27	I'm tired.
411	00:32:29	00:32:31	I'm tired.
412	00:32:31	00:32:33	I understand.
413	00:32:33	00:32:35	I'll let you rest. Mm.
414	00:32:40	00:32:42	Thank you.
415	00:32:54	00:32:56	What are you doing?
416	00:32:58	00:32:59	Isn't that Langston's kit?
417	00:32:59	00:33:01	There were marks on Haskell's wrists.
418	00:33:01	00:33:03	They look like flex-cuffs.
419	00:33:03	00:33:09	So now you're checking to see if his kit is still stocked with three department-issue cuffs?
420	00:33:09	00:33:10	Yep.
421	00:33:14	00:33:16	What if it was me?
422	00:33:17	00:33:18	My kit?
423	00:33:18	00:33:20	I'd open it.
424	00:33:22	00:33:31	We have all had our moment in the dark where we had to fight our way out, and when we did, it was up to the rest of the team to shine a light onto that darkness to see what happened.
425	00:33:31	00:33:32	That's our job.
426	00:33:34	00:33:41	I just need to know what I'm dealing with and then I will deal with it.
427	00:33:57	00:33:59	Three cuffs.
428	00:34:00	00:34:01	Satisfied?
429	00:34:06	00:34:08	That the report for I.A.?
430	00:34:10	00:34:12	That took longer than I expected.
431	00:34:12	00:34:16	There was a question about whether Langston might have used flex- cuffs on Haskell.
432	00:34:16	00:34:18	And?
433	00:34:18	00:34:24	Greg and Sara didn't find any at the scene, but you were the first responder.
434	00:34:25	00:34:27	Is that a question?
435	00:34:27	00:34:31	I didn't see any mention of flex-cuffs in your report.
436	00:34:31	00:34:33	No, you didn't.
437	00:34:33	00:34:36	I presume Ray had all three pairs in his kit.
438	00:34:36	00:34:39	All three, yeah, you've got quite a memory there.
439	00:34:39	00:34:41	Know how to stock a kit.
440	00:34:45	00:34:50	You have a problem, you have about five seconds to spit it out.
441	00:34:50	00:34:52	I look out for my team.
442	00:34:52	00:34:53	How about you?
443	00:34:53	00:34:54	Now, are you going to sign that or what?
444	00:34:54	00:34:56	I already did.
445	00:34:56	00:34:57	We all did.
446	00:34:58	00:35:00	I made you a copy.
447	00:35:00	00:35:02	Save you time.
448	00:35:02	00:35:05	The evidence supports CSI Langston acting in self-defense.
449	00:35:36	00:35:38	If you care about her, don't go in there.
450	00:35:41	00:35:48	The doctor says Gloria is okay to fly back to Baltimore with me, and we're leaving in the morning.
451	00:35:48	00:35:49	She doesn't want to talk about this.
452	00:35:49	00:35:51	She wants to forget, and the sight of you would just...
453	00:35:51	00:35:55	I understand, Nora.
454	00:35:55	00:35:57	I know I'm responsible for what's happened to her.
455	00:35:57	00:36:01	I'd like to try and find a way to atone for it, if I can.
456	00:36:04	00:36:07	I know that we have never liked each other.
457	00:36:07	00:36:11	I've never understood what Gloria saw in you, but...
458	00:36:11	00:36:14	(sighs) ...what I said to you earlier...
459	00:36:15	00:36:20	It's not for me to blame or judge you.
460	00:36:22	00:36:24	That's okay, she'll do that.
461	00:36:24	00:36:35	Well, she can't speak for herself yet, so if that's the answer you're looking for, you're going to have to wait.
462	00:36:35	00:36:38	She needs to go home to heal.
463	00:36:42	00:36:45	I hope you find peace, Ray.
464	00:37:41	00:37:43	What are you doing here?
465	00:37:45	00:37:49	You know, it's weird, I... I just got off the phone with the police officer in the black-and-white across the street.
466	00:37:49	00:37:51	He's looking out for trespassers.
467	00:37:51	00:37:54	He's wrangling these crime geeks who want to spend a night in the House of Haskell.
468	00:37:54	00:37:57	Now, that wouldn't be you, would it?
469	00:38:02	00:38:04	You killed a murderer in self-defense.
470	00:38:04	00:38:06	You get that, right?
471	00:38:09	00:38:14	I get that, uh, I did everything I could do for Gloria.
472	00:38:20	00:38:24	Look, Jim, I knew what I was walking into.
473	00:38:28	00:38:31	Nice to see you leading this dance finally, Ray.
474	00:38:31	00:38:35	I can feel your pulse, Nate.
475	00:38:35	00:38:36	Feel your heart beating.
476	00:38:36	00:38:38	Can you...?
477	00:38:39	00:38:46	If I'd hit you a moment earlier, just the upstroke of your heartbeat's T-wave, I could have induced commotio cordis, or instant death.
478	00:38:46	00:38:47	But you didn't, Ray.
479	00:38:47	00:38:49	This is a slow dance.
480	00:38:49	00:38:51	You made sure of that.
481	00:38:51	00:38:54	You spent a lifetime trying to make me suffer...
482	00:38:54	00:38:56	like you made a lot of other people.
483	00:38:58	00:39:00	Scarred me for life!
484	00:39:00	00:39:01	Took my kidney.
485	00:39:01	00:39:03	Well, I'm gonna help myself to one of yours.
486	00:39:04	00:39:06	Let it go.
487	00:39:06	00:39:08	Let it out, Ray, let it out!
488	00:39:08	00:39:10	Let it out.
489	00:39:10	00:39:13	There's still more in you, Ray, still more of me in there.
490	00:39:13	00:39:17	There's a little bit of me in her, too, Ray.
491	00:39:19	00:39:23	I think I know where you want to take me, Nate.
492	00:39:23	00:39:24	But you know something?
493	00:39:24	00:39:27	I'm already there.
494	00:39:31	00:39:32	It's all right, Nate.
495	00:39:32	00:39:34	It's all right, It's all right.
496	00:39:34	00:39:35	I'll take you the rest of the way.
497	00:39:43	00:39:55	Look... we are the only two people in the world who know what really happened here, and this stays between you and me 'cause if I.A. gets ahold of it, Internal Affairs is going to kick this up to a criminal case.
498	00:39:55	00:40:03	They'll try you for murder, Ray, they'll lock you up, and it won't just be you you'll be crucifying.
499	00:40:20	00:40:22	What?
500	00:40:22	00:40:27	I had white chalk on my hands-- transfer from Gloria.
501	00:40:39	00:40:40	Music notes.
502	00:41:16	00:41:19	The Swan by Saint-Saens.
503	00:41:19	00:41:22	It's not really the story for a first date...
504	00:41:24	00:41:27	...but, um...
505	00:41:27	00:41:31	that piece of music...
506	00:41:31	00:41:33	saved my life.
507	00:41:33	00:41:36	Saved her life.
508	00:41:36	00:41:38	She knew you'd come back for her.
509	00:41:40	00:41:42	You did the right thing, brother.
510	00:41:57	00:42:03	After everything that's happened between the two of you, it's natural that you'd need some reflection.
511	00:42:03	00:42:06	Reflection.
512	00:42:06	00:42:09	That's what he saw when he looked at me.
513	00:42:09	00:42:12	That's what he wanted you to believe.
514	00:42:12	00:42:15	He wanted to bring you into that house with him.
515	00:42:15	00:42:24	He wanted to make you a helpless child, just like him, huddled against that bedroom wall with nothing but terror on the other side.
516	00:42:24	00:42:28	My daddy was on the other side of that wall in my house.
517	00:42:28	00:42:36	The difference between me and Nate Haskell is that I decided to train myself to be good, like other people.
518	00:42:36	00:42:37	Be good, Ray.
519	00:42:37	00:42:43	Even scratched it into my desk when I was little-- be good.
520	00:42:43	00:42:45	Be good.
521	00:42:46	00:42:50	You aregood.
522	00:42:54	00:42:59	This is the formal interview of CSI Raymond Langston...
523	00:43:01	00:43:07	...with regard to the incident resulting in the death of Warner Thorpe, aka Nate Haskell.
524	00:43:09	00:43:15	CSI Langston has been informed of his administrative rights and understands the nature of this investigation.
525	00:43:17	00:43:20	We will commence with CSI Langston's account of the facts in this case...
526	00:43:20	00:43:24	The fact is... that I killed a man.
527	00:43:25	00:43:28	That's why you're here.
528	00:43:28	00:43:30	how did you kill him?
529	00:43:31	00:43:34	Was it self-defense...
530	00:43:34	00:43:36	or murder?
