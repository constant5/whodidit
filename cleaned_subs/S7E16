0	00:01:02	00:01:05	Catherine, layout room, right away!
1	00:01:20	00:01:23	Gil, where's the fire?
2	00:01:36	00:01:38	It's been sitting in my office for the last four weeks.
3	00:01:39	00:01:40	But...
4	00:01:40	00:01:43	We caught the Miniature serial killer; he confessed.
5	00:01:43	00:01:45	Yeah, I watched him blow his brains out.
6	00:01:45	00:01:49	But I think the package was postmarked after he killed himself.
7	00:01:49	00:01:53	So maybe he arranged to have it sent postmortem.
8	00:01:53	00:01:58	The three other murders, the miniature was left at the scene.
9	00:01:58	00:01:59	This one was addressed to me.
10	00:02:01	00:02:03	So, now it's personal?
11	00:02:03	00:02:11	The victim appears to be a Caucasian female with lots of books.
12	00:02:11	00:02:13	It could be an office, somebody's living room...
13	00:02:13	00:02:16	or a modern hotel lobby.
14	00:02:16	00:02:18	When I was gone, did anybody work a scene like this?
15	00:02:18	00:02:20	No... at least not on our shift.
16	00:02:22	00:02:26	I'll check with days and swing, and see if anybody caught a case that matches.
17	00:02:26	00:02:28	Never mind.
18	00:02:28	00:02:28	Why not?
19	00:02:29	00:02:30	Take a look at the early edition.
20	00:02:40	00:02:42	It's dated the day after tomorrow.
21	00:02:42	00:02:46	This murder hasn't happened yet.
22	00:03:29	00:03:32	My name is Ernest Edward Dell.
23	00:03:32	00:03:38	I was born in 1946 in Ames, Iowa.
24	00:03:38	00:03:43	My life's been hard, but I don't complain.
25	00:03:43	00:03:45	I never expected better.
26	00:03:47	00:03:49	I'm good with my hands.
27	00:03:49	00:03:51	I make things. I fix things.
28	00:03:51	00:03:53	I'm a handyman.
29	00:03:53	00:03:54	That's what I am.
30	00:03:55	00:03:58	I'm not the sociable type. I-I know that.
31	00:03:58	00:04:07	You spend any amount of time around people, you get your heart broke-- treachery, hypocrisy...
32	00:04:07	00:04:09	the promise of love.
33	00:04:09	00:04:14	A man has a right to an honest day's pay.
34	00:04:14	00:04:19	Me, I service the machinery of death so that people can eat.
35	00:04:21	00:04:23	If that makes me evil, then so be it.
36	00:04:23	00:04:28	The Miniature Killer murdered three people over a period of roughly six months.
37	00:04:28	00:04:31	Ernie Dell was either directly or indirectly related to all of them.
38	00:04:31	00:04:34	What's with the bloody dolls?
39	00:04:34	00:04:35	We're not sure.
40	00:04:35	00:04:40	There's a different perspective of that same image in all of the miniatures.
41	00:04:40	00:04:44	We're thinking it could be some kind of signature.
42	00:04:44	00:04:52	Look into the mouth of a person and you'll find lies wriggling there like maggots waiting to grow wings.
43	00:04:52	00:04:55	The world has... has gone mad.
44	00:04:55	00:05:05	A man could kill from sunup to sunset, and still his work would never be done.
45	00:05:14	00:05:15	Remember the Blue Paint killers?
46	00:05:15	00:05:18	Maybe Ernie Dell had a partner.
47	00:05:18	00:05:20	Like an apprentice, an accomplice, something like that.
48	00:05:20	00:05:21	Or a disciple.
49	00:05:21	00:05:23	You guys make models when you were kids?
50	00:05:23	00:05:25	Tanks and airplanes.
51	00:05:25	00:05:26	Classic cars.
52	00:05:26	00:05:31	These miniatures are obsessively precise, half-inch scale models of the crime scenes.
53	00:05:31	00:05:36	They probably took weeks of focused effort to create.
54	00:05:36	00:05:38	I don't think the killer's into team sports.
55	00:05:38	00:05:40	Izzy Delancy...
56	00:05:43	00:05:44	he was a rock star.
57	00:05:44	00:05:46	You know, famous brings out the nut jobs.
58	00:05:46	00:05:48	Maybe we're just looking at a copycat.
59	00:05:48	00:05:50	The miniatures were never released to the press.
60	00:05:50	00:05:52	No photos, nothing.
61	00:05:52	00:05:54	You can't copy what you can't see.
62	00:05:54	00:05:56	Other people had access to those files.
63	00:05:56	00:05:58	Maybe it was a cop.
64	00:05:58	00:06:00	Or somebody in the lab.
65	00:06:00	00:06:02	It's been known to happen.
66	00:06:04	00:06:08	Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes the rap for three murders, and then eats a .38. Why?
67	00:06:10	00:06:16	I think he was trying to protect someone-- someone that he cared a lot about.
68	00:06:32	00:06:36	Prints and DNA are going over the package and wrapping paper.
69	00:06:36	00:06:38	They won't find anything.
70	00:06:39	00:06:41	Return address was an empty lot.
71	00:06:44	00:06:45	Any clue as to who the victim is?
72	00:06:46	00:06:49	No, I even went through her little purse.
73	00:06:53	00:06:54	Well, she's not wearing a wedding ring.
74	00:06:54	00:06:57	She's probably single.
75	00:06:59	00:07:01	Her eyes appear to be bloodshot.
76	00:07:03	00:07:05	Petechial hemorrhaging?
77	00:07:07	00:07:09	Look at this.
78	00:07:12	00:07:15	Blue smudges on the pillow.
79	00:07:15	00:07:18	Blue mascara on the victim.
80	00:07:24	00:07:29	Our vic gets comfortable, grabs a little shut-eye...
81	00:07:34	00:07:37	...and never wakes up.
82	00:07:39	00:07:41	She's going to be smothered.
83	00:07:41	00:07:43	It would seem so.
84	00:07:46	00:07:52	If you interpret this headline literally, the doll is the victim.
85	00:07:52	00:07:53	That's different than the others.
86	00:07:53	00:07:55	Methods change.
87	00:07:55	00:07:57	Killers evolve.
88	00:08:01	00:08:02	What?
89	00:08:02	00:08:04	Keppler said something like that once.
90	00:08:08	00:08:10	He did come down on the right side.
91	00:08:13	00:08:23	These books are all arranged by subject matter art, religion, science...
92	00:08:23	00:08:27	The victim is apparently well-educated.
93	00:08:37	00:08:39	That's from the Izzy Delancy miniature.
94	00:08:39	00:08:40	What's it doing here?
95	00:08:40	00:08:42	I don't know.
96	00:08:52	00:08:56	There's something on the surface.
97	00:08:56	00:08:57	Looks like brush strokes.
98	00:09:47	00:09:49	Hey, Sara, I heard we got another miniature.
99	00:09:49	00:09:50	Is that true?
100	00:09:50	00:09:54	Yeah, it's like Ernie Dell was covering for someone.
101	00:09:55	00:09:57	No kidding?
102	00:09:57	00:10:00	Hey, you were the one who checked for next of kin after his suicide, right?
103	00:10:00	00:10:06	SOP.Snail mail, email, bank accounts, police records, Google.
104	00:10:06	00:10:08	All I got was he's a widower.
105	00:10:08	00:10:10	Received his wife's Social Security benefits.
106	00:10:10	00:10:12	He had to be connected to somebody.
107	00:10:15	00:10:17	It's kind of early for court.
108	00:10:17	00:10:21	Finally rescheduled my deposition for the civil suit.
109	00:10:21	00:10:28	You know, Demitrius James' family is suing the city for 3.5 million.
110	00:10:28	00:10:30	That's going to be a long deposition.
111	00:10:41	00:10:43	Home movies.
112	00:11:29	00:11:31	Hey, boss. We're ordering out for breakfast.
113	00:11:32	00:11:33	You have a cat, don't you, Hodges?
114	00:11:33	00:11:34	Mr. K.
115	00:11:34	00:11:36	Kobayashi-Mare.
116	00:11:36	00:11:38	It's in reference to... Do you ever take him out of the house?
117	00:11:38	00:11:41	My little Kobe? No way.
118	00:11:41	00:11:43	Vegas is coyote country.
119	00:11:43	00:11:47	So if this is a house cat, then this must be somebody's home.
120	00:11:47	00:11:49	Tsk, tsk.
121	00:11:49	00:11:51	Looks like he's been in the milk.
122	00:11:51	00:11:53	Yeah.
123	00:11:53	00:11:56	Maybe the victim has as well.
124	00:11:57	00:12:01	The previous murders have all involved the victim's habits and routines.
125	00:12:01	00:12:06	So maybe this time, it's a little something extra in her afternoon tea.
126	00:12:10	00:12:12	So they're going to be poisoned.
127	00:12:16	00:12:23	She lays down for her usual nap, the cat sneaks a sip, and neither one ever wakes up again.
128	00:12:23	00:12:28	It doesn't matter how she dies if we can't figure out who she is or where she is.
129	00:12:29	00:12:31	Well, you can't figure that out on an empty stomach.
130	00:12:31	00:12:36	If you don't like this restaurant, there's plenty of others to choose from.
131	00:12:46	00:12:48	I choose these two.
132	00:13:24	00:13:30	We're looking for a building whose exterior looks exactly like this.
133	00:13:34	00:13:35	So what are we looking at, Rick?
134	00:13:35	00:13:41	We've got a modernist structure with cement beams steel rails, frosted glass.
135	00:13:41	00:13:43	Something like that.
136	00:13:43	00:13:46	Probably, but whatever it is, it should match exactly.
137	00:13:46	00:13:47	The killer's hyper-specific.
138	00:13:47	00:13:49	Well, maybe that'll work in our favor.
139	00:13:52	00:13:55	Even if we find a match, we could already be too late.
140	00:14:04	00:14:06	Let's check it out.
141	00:14:07	00:14:09	Nick Stokes, LVPD.
142	00:14:09	00:14:10	We're looking for a woman that lives in this building.
143	00:14:10	00:14:12	She looks like this.
144	00:14:12	00:14:13	Have you ever seen her?
145	00:14:13	00:14:16	That looks like a doll.
146	00:14:16	00:14:18	Yeah, well, it's actually a death threat.
147	00:14:18	00:14:20	Time is of the essence here.
148	00:14:20	00:14:23	Can you help us out? Anyone in the building look like this? No.
149	00:14:23	00:14:25	She's got a cat. Well, that narrows it down to about a hundred tenants.
150	00:14:27	00:14:28	That's her home.
151	00:14:28	00:14:30	1106. That's Ms. Tallman's place.
152	00:14:46	00:14:48	Ms. Tallman? Las Vegas Police.
153	00:14:48	00:14:50	You need to open your door, please.
154	00:14:56	00:14:58	Ms. Tallman?
155	00:14:59	00:15:00	Open and stand clear.
156	00:15:44	00:15:45	(music continues blasting) Please, ma'am, calm down.
157	00:15:45	00:15:46	We're with the Crime Lab.
158	00:15:46	00:15:48	This isn't a lab. This is my home.
159	00:15:49	00:15:50	You must be confused.
160	00:15:50	00:15:53	No, we're not confused. We're here for your protection.
161	00:15:56	00:15:57	Ms. Tallman...
162	00:15:57	00:16:00	Dr. Tallman.
163	00:16:00	00:16:02	Dr. Tallman...
164	00:16:02	00:16:04	I need you to take a look at this.
165	00:16:06	00:16:08	Did you make this for me?
166	00:16:08	00:16:10	That's very sweet.
167	00:16:10	00:16:11	It's a death threat.
168	00:16:11	00:16:13	Who would want to kill me?
169	00:16:13	00:16:20	Doctor, do you normally take a nap around the same time every day covering your face and eyes with the pillow?
170	00:16:21	00:16:22	00 p.m.
171	00:16:22	00:16:28	I... I have tea and cookies every day when I wake up.
172	00:16:28	00:16:30	Have you been watching me?
173	00:16:30	00:16:33	No, Miss, no, but we think someone else has.
174	00:16:33	00:16:35	Doctor, your life is in danger.
175	00:16:35	00:16:36	We need you to get dressed and come with us, please.
176	00:16:38	00:16:40	Am I in trouble?
177	00:16:40	00:16:41	No, ma'am.
178	00:16:41	00:16:43	No, not anymore.
179	00:16:43	00:16:46	This officer will help you get your things, okay?
180	00:16:46	00:16:48	No, no, no.
181	00:16:48	00:16:51	I'll go get my things.
182	00:16:51	00:16:56	I want you to know that you young men are refreshingly polite.
183	00:16:57	00:16:58	Thank you.
184	00:17:02	00:17:04	Is she on something?
185	00:17:04	00:17:06	She may have already been poisoned.
186	00:17:06	00:17:07	We'll get her to the hospital.
187	00:17:08	00:17:09	We should collect blood for tox.
188	00:17:09	00:17:11	And any open food or drink.
189	00:17:12	00:17:14	Hey, go on, shoo!
190	00:17:14	00:17:17	The killer did plan every detail.
191	00:17:17	00:17:19	Except for us showing up.
192	00:17:36	00:17:38	That's got to be Ernie Dell's wife.
193	00:17:38	00:17:40	Quite the bash.
194	00:17:43	00:17:44	They must love kids.
195	00:17:48	00:17:50	Is that Ernie's son?
196	00:17:50	00:17:53	There's no record of a son, but it sure looks like it.
197	00:17:53	00:17:58	One, two, three, four, five birthday candles in 1988 would make him around 24 now.
198	00:18:05	00:18:09	Hmm. Don't look like a very happy birthday.
199	00:18:10	00:18:11	Did you get the boy's name?
200	00:18:12	00:18:14	Cake never made it on camera.
201	00:18:14	00:18:15	How about audio?
202	00:18:15	00:18:22	It sucks. '80s video cam with built-in, non-directional mic, pulls in nothing but wind and train noise.
203	00:18:22	00:18:23	So let's process it.
204	00:18:23	00:18:25	This is processed.
205	00:18:30	00:18:34	We ran tox on Ms. Tallman's blood as well as her milk and cookies.
206	00:18:34	00:18:40	She was negative on everything from pharmaceuticals and illicits, to herbicides, pesticides and heavy metals.
207	00:18:40	00:18:41	You sure she was going to be poisoned?
208	00:18:41	00:18:44	No, but I'm pretty sure she was scheduled to die today.
209	00:18:44	00:18:47	In each of the previous cases, the killer was at the scene to commit the murder.
210	00:18:47	00:18:51	So maybe he was planning to show up at the condo.
211	00:18:51	00:18:54	Well, it'd be kind of rude not to greet him, don't you think?
212	00:19:10	00:19:13	I'm ready for my close-up.
213	00:19:17	00:19:19	Definitely beats walking the beat.
214	00:19:22	00:19:24	Feed's good.
215	00:19:24	00:19:26	Officer Kamen, how's your read?
216	00:19:29	00:19:31	Time to go to sleep.
217	00:19:36	00:19:39	All units, this is Brass.
218	00:19:39	00:19:41	Maintain a low profile.
219	00:19:41	00:19:44	That means I don't want to see a uniform within three blocks of this place, okay?
220	00:20:02	00:20:04	Where you headed? 11.
221	00:20:08	00:20:11	Oh, sorry. Ten.
222	00:20:13	00:20:15	Go on up.
223	00:20:28	00:20:30	Hold the elevator.
224	00:20:31	00:20:33	What floor?
225	00:20:34	00:20:36	11.
226	00:20:40	00:20:41	Someone's coming up.
227	00:20:41	00:20:43	White male with a suitcase.
228	00:20:59	00:21:01	We got a possible.
229	00:21:03	00:21:05	LVPD. Up against the wall.
230	00:21:05	00:21:07	What? She said hands against the wall.
231	00:21:09	00:21:11	What's your business here, sir? Nothing.
232	00:21:11	00:21:13	I mean, this is my sister's place.
233	00:21:13	00:21:15	I'm Peyton Tallman.
234	00:21:15	00:21:17	Where's Barbara? Did something happen to her?
235	00:21:20	00:21:24	This officer will explain everything to your satisfaction. Get him out of here.
236	00:21:24	00:21:26	What?
237	00:21:27	00:21:29	Peyton Tallman's ID checks out.
238	00:21:29	00:21:33	And I kind of doubt the killer's going to make a miniature crime scene of his own sister's house.
239	00:21:33	00:21:36	And we have nothing to link him to the other three murders?
240	00:21:36	00:21:38	He wants to see his sister.
241	00:21:38	00:21:39	I'll let you know how that goes down.
242	00:21:39	00:21:41	Okay. Thanks.
243	00:22:07	00:22:08	Okay, that's it.
244	00:22:09	00:22:10	Killer's not gonna show.
245	00:22:12	00:22:14	Let's call it a night.
246	00:22:31	00:22:37	All right, I know you must be exhausted after your brutal day in the field, but it's time to go.
247	00:22:39	00:22:41	Officer Kamen?
248	00:22:54	00:22:57	She's pale.
249	00:22:57	00:22:59	No sign of trauma.
250	00:22:59	00:23:00	COD'll have to wait till autopsy.
251	00:23:00	00:23:02	Sorry.
252	00:23:02	00:23:04	Not as sorry as I am.
253	00:23:46	00:23:51	Look, I know we've all had a tough day, but the sooner we get done here, the sooner we can all go home.
254	00:23:51	00:23:54	(sniffles) Why? So my little Tripper can run out to greet me?
255	00:23:54	00:23:55	Barbara.
256	00:23:55	00:23:57	I'm sorry about your cat, ma'am. We lost an officer.
257	00:23:57	00:23:59	How much did you love her? Barbara, please.
258	00:23:59	00:24:04	When my guys went to your house, they said you were a little out of it, but you're thinking clearly now, right?
259	00:24:05	00:24:07	Well, having your home invaded can be a little bracing.
260	00:24:07	00:24:09	Captain, how can we help?
261	00:24:09	00:24:12	Can you tell me why anyone would want to kill you?
262	00:24:12	00:24:13	No.
263	00:24:13	00:24:15	But you can.
264	00:24:15	00:24:17	Well, Barbara was a highly regarded psychotherapist.
265	00:24:17	00:24:19	Is.
266	00:24:19	00:24:20	That hasn't changed.
267	00:24:20	00:24:21	Is or was?
268	00:24:21	00:24:23	I'm retired.
269	00:24:23	00:24:24	You seem a little young to be retired.
270	00:24:24	00:24:26	I got tired of it.
271	00:24:26	00:24:29	Can you tell me why one of her patients would want to kill her?
272	00:24:29	00:24:30	No.
273	00:24:30	00:24:31	Well, no, it's-it's possible.
274	00:24:31	00:24:37	She, um... she counseled a lot of at-risk adults, um, halfway house kids, pro bono.
275	00:24:37	00:24:41	I also treated suburban sexual dysfunction for $300 an hour.
276	00:24:41	00:24:42	She helped a lot of people.
277	00:24:43	00:24:44	Did you work out of your home?
278	00:24:44	00:24:46	For the last few years.
279	00:24:46	00:24:48	Treat any sociopaths?
280	00:24:48	00:24:51	(laughs) That's not a term for which there's any diagnostic criteria.
281	00:24:51	00:24:53	You're not looking for one of my patients.
282	00:24:53	00:24:54	Well, maybe I am.
283	00:24:54	00:24:57	Maybe I'm looking for a 20-something-year-old male, last name of Dell.
284	00:24:57	00:24:58	Won't say.
285	00:24:58	00:24:59	She can't say.
286	00:25:00	00:25:01	It's doctor-patient confidentiality.
287	00:25:01	00:25:02	But you're retired.
288	00:25:02	00:25:03	Well, you know where I live. Are you done yet?
289	00:25:03	00:25:06	No, we're not done yet. At least, I'm not done yet.
290	00:25:06	00:25:09	All right, look, let's start again, all right?
291	00:25:09	00:25:10	Let's...
292	00:25:10	00:25:13	Maybe we started off on the wrong foot, all right?
293	00:25:13	00:25:19	Look, I'm asking you as a professional, as a psychotherapist, please... help me out here.
294	00:25:22	00:25:26	Okay? Tell me... what am I looking for?
295	00:25:33	00:25:35	Repetition...
296	00:25:35	00:25:40	attention to detail indicates obsessive-compulsive disorder.
297	00:25:40	00:25:43	Obvious antisocial personality.
298	00:25:43	00:25:47	Uh, yeah, four bodies-- I'd call that antisocial.
299	00:25:48	00:25:54	Most murderers lack impulse control, inability to plan ahead, but...
300	00:25:54	00:25:56	this one's different.
301	00:25:57	00:25:59	Different how?
302	00:26:02	00:26:04	He conceives murder...
303	00:26:04	00:26:06	visualizes it.
304	00:26:08	00:26:10	Then he takes all that horror that he's imagined.
305	00:26:10	00:26:12	He compresses it into these little rooms.
306	00:26:12	00:26:17	These models literally indicate repressed rage.
307	00:26:19	00:26:25	And when you start taking that apart, all that rage comes flying out...
308	00:26:26	00:26:31	...and you will have let the monster out of the box.
309	00:26:41	00:26:43	Stop hovering, Hodges.
310	00:26:43	00:26:44	You're in or you're out.
311	00:26:44	00:26:45	In.
312	00:26:49	00:26:51	So, she wasn't poisoned, huh?
313	00:26:51	00:26:52	No.
314	00:26:52	00:26:54	Hand me a scalpel.
315	00:27:07	00:27:09	Tweezers.
316	00:27:21	00:27:24	Nice lungs.
317	00:27:52	00:27:54	Grissom.
318	00:27:54	00:28:00	Yeah, Gil, uh, got a good idea on COD for your asphyxiated officer.
319	00:28:00	00:28:05	Internal organ color nailed it on both the autopsy and necropsy as...
320	00:28:05	00:28:07	Carbon monoxide poisoning.
321	00:28:07	00:28:10	You know, nobody likes when you do that.
322	00:28:10	00:28:13	So, how did CO get into the room?
323	00:28:13	00:28:15	That I don't know.
324	00:29:03	00:29:13	The timer goes off, activating the motor, which closes the flue and drops powdered charcoal onto the flames, producing carbon monoxide.
325	00:29:13	00:29:19	Fumes have nowhere to go but out into the apartment, into Officer Kamen.
326	00:29:19	00:29:21	And the cat.
327	00:29:21	00:29:24	You know, this timer was geared to run for weeks.
328	00:29:24	00:29:28	It could have easily been put in place a month ago.
329	00:29:28	00:29:31	That's why the killer felt safe enough to send me the miniature.
330	00:29:31	00:29:33	He never intended to be at the scene.
331	00:29:33	00:29:35	There was no danger of being caught.
332	00:29:37	00:29:40	Hey, Sara, check this out.
333	00:29:40	00:29:42	I was digging through Mannleigh Chicken's employee health insurance records...
334	00:29:43	00:29:47	45 million Americans without health coverage, and a chicken slaughterhouse provides medical benefits?
335	00:29:47	00:29:52	Izzy Delancy's animal rights PSA forced the company to clean up its act in all departments.
336	00:29:55	00:29:56	a son.
337	00:29:56	00:29:57	Lionel Dell.
338	00:29:57	00:29:58	Unbelievable.
339	00:29:58	00:30:00	Yeah, the man loved his trains.
340	00:30:00	00:30:04	Lionel changed his name to Mitchell Douglas after he turned 18, and get this.
341	00:30:04	00:30:07	He did time in a halfway house after getting busted for fentanyl.
342	00:30:07	00:30:11	Which connects him to the fentanyl-dealing sexagenarian, Penny Garden.
343	00:30:11	00:30:13	Where's young Dell now?
344	00:30:17	00:30:19	Lionel Dell?
345	00:30:22	00:30:24	My name is Mitch Douglas.
346	00:30:24	00:30:27	I'm Sara Sidle. I'm with the Crime Lab.
347	00:30:27	00:30:29	I was wondering if you knew this woman.
348	00:30:29	00:30:32	She used to sell fentanyl.
349	00:30:32	00:30:35	Want me to pee in a cup?
350	00:30:36	00:30:38	What about this guy? He's dead, too.
351	00:30:39	00:30:43	He was found face down in a chicken stun bath in a place your dad used to work.
352	00:30:43	00:30:46	He worked a lot of places.
353	00:30:47	00:30:49	I met a lot of people.
354	00:30:51	00:30:54	Did you know Izzy Delancy?
355	00:30:54	00:30:57	Yeah.
356	00:30:57	00:30:59	His music sucks.
357	00:31:01	00:31:03	What do all these stiffs got to do with me?
358	00:31:03	00:31:06	What was your relationship like with your father?
359	00:31:06	00:31:09	Before or after he blew his brains out?
360	00:31:09	00:31:11	Let's start with... before.
361	00:31:11	00:31:17	You ever step in a pile of crap, but you're wearing boots, so you can't just scrape it off.
362	00:31:18	00:31:25	You got to dig it out with a stick, but even that doesn't work, so you just end up tossing the boots in the trash?
363	00:31:25	00:31:27	It was kind of like that.
364	00:31:27	00:31:29	And after?
365	00:31:29	00:31:31	Much better.
366	00:31:33	00:31:34	You gonna arrest me?
367	00:31:35	00:31:37	We're just talking.
368	00:31:37	00:31:39	I'm not.
369	00:32:07	00:32:09	Did you know Officer Kamen?
370	00:32:09	00:32:11	No.
371	00:32:11	00:32:13	Me, neither.
372	00:32:16	00:32:20	I was watching her die, and I didn't even realize it.
373	00:32:22	00:32:28	Look, Sofia, there weren't any carbon monoxide sensors in the apartment, so no one could have known.
374	00:32:28	00:32:29	Yeah.
375	00:32:29	00:32:35	And in fact, if I hadn't have gone away, we'd have had another month to work with; you'd have never been in that position.
376	00:32:37	00:32:41	It doesn't make you feel any better either, does it?
377	00:32:46	00:32:48	You know, the scene's been released.
378	00:32:48	00:32:51	Ms. Tallman was pretty insistent.
379	00:32:51	00:32:55	We offered to leave a uniform with her, but she wasn't having it.
380	00:32:57	00:33:01	So, what are you looking for?
381	00:33:01	00:33:03	The miniature's complete.
382	00:33:03	00:33:05	It's not perfect, though.
383	00:33:05	00:33:09	Officer Kamen was not the intended victim.
384	00:33:09	00:33:11	Well, she was dressed like her.
385	00:33:11	00:33:13	She died in the right position.
386	00:33:14	00:33:15	So did the cat.
387	00:33:15	00:33:18	I'm still not sure it's perfect enough.
388	00:33:22	00:33:23	Grissom.
389	00:33:23	00:33:25	Yeah.
390	00:33:27	00:33:30	Okay.
391	00:33:34	00:33:36	Now, it's perfect.
392	00:34:08	00:34:10	It's déjà vu all over again.
393	00:34:10	00:34:13	Not entirely.
394	00:34:13	00:34:15	There's some kind of liquid.
395	00:34:15	00:34:17	It looks like it fell and splashes on the floor...
396	00:34:18	00:34:19	on the body...
397	00:34:19	00:34:21	and it looks like...
398	00:34:21	00:34:23	the ear.
399	00:34:29	00:34:31	This could be the source.
400	00:34:31	00:34:34	Killer returns to...
401	00:34:34	00:34:36	complete the miniature the old-fashioned way.
402	00:34:36	00:34:37	And things get a little messy.
403	00:34:37	00:34:39	But in the end...
404	00:34:39	00:34:42	he puts everything right back where it belongs.
405	00:34:42	00:34:48	What happened to my sister was not just some isolated tragedy.
406	00:34:48	00:34:57	There have been four other murders, four deaths which could have been prevented had the public been warned by the people sworn to protect us.
407	00:34:57	00:35:01	Barbara Tallman was the latest victim of a serial killer...
408	00:35:01	00:35:04	the LVPD has known about for months.
409	00:35:04	00:35:05	What do they call him?
410	00:35:05	00:35:14	They call him The Miniature Killer, because he makes little models of his victims posed in the places where they die.
411	00:35:14	00:35:17	I feel for the guy, but he just made our job a lot harder.
412	00:35:17	00:35:19	It was inevitable.
413	00:35:19	00:35:23	With each murder, the amount of information that could leak rose exponentially.
414	00:35:23	00:35:29	I'm a private person, but if this prevents just one tragedy, then it's worth it.
415	00:35:31	00:35:34	Trace report on the second crime scene or...
416	00:35:35	00:35:36	or should I say second murder?
417	00:35:36	00:35:38	Crime scene is the same.
418	00:35:38	00:35:44	Haven't finished processing all the samples, but the water from the vase is consistent with the water found on the victim's clothing.
419	00:35:44	00:35:46	There's chlorine bleach in the samples.
420	00:35:46	00:35:48	Why put bleach in vase water?
421	00:35:48	00:35:50	I knew you'd ask that.
422	00:35:50	00:35:53	Well, I had this girlfriend who was a florist...
423	00:35:53	00:35:55	The one with the water retention problem.
424	00:35:55	00:35:57	You remembered.
425	00:35:57	00:35:59	Anyway...
426	00:35:59	00:36:05	she said that if you add a few drops of bleach to your water, it kills bacteria, and gives your flowers a nice long life, but add too much...
427	00:36:05	00:36:07	the flowers die.
428	00:36:09	00:36:12	Grissom, we may have caught a break on Barbara Tallman.
429	00:36:12	00:36:14	She did pro bono work at Lionel Dell's halfway house.
430	00:36:17	00:36:19	Okay, so maybe I met her. So what?
431	00:36:19	00:36:21	So, she's dead.
432	00:36:21	00:36:25	That's four stiffs associated with you, Lionel.
433	00:36:27	00:36:29	Five, if you count Ernie.
434	00:36:29	00:36:31	I don't.
435	00:36:31	00:36:34	You know, you keep saying that you hated your dad, but I'm not buying it.
436	00:36:34	00:36:36	You go through your life alone.
437	00:36:36	00:36:38	You're good with your hands. You have weird hobbies.
438	00:36:38	00:36:40	You make little things.
439	00:36:40	00:36:42	And when that gets tricky...
440	00:36:43	00:36:45	you call your father.
441	00:36:45	00:36:49	Maybe Ernie didn't know you were a killer.
442	00:36:49	00:36:53	Police start poking around, asking questions, showing him pictures.
443	00:36:53	00:36:55	And when Ernie sees these...
444	00:36:55	00:36:59	he knows exactly what his little boy's become.
445	00:36:59	00:37:02	To the rest of the world, a monster, but to him...
446	00:37:02	00:37:06	just a little boy knocking over his birthday cake.
447	00:37:08	00:37:11	So he confesses to crimes you committed, shoots himself in the head; It's a dead end for us.
448	00:37:11	00:37:13	New start for you.
449	00:37:17	00:37:20	If only.
450	00:37:20	00:37:23	Let me tell you about Ernie.
451	00:37:23	00:37:27	What he cared about in this life was...
452	00:37:28	00:37:33	his wife, his trains, and his kids.
453	00:37:33	00:37:35	In that order.
454	00:37:35	00:37:38	Kids? You're an only child.
455	00:37:38	00:37:41	Again, if only.
456	00:37:41	00:37:44	If you're looking for a love connection, then...
457	00:37:45	00:37:47	then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.
458	00:37:47	00:37:48	What are you talking about?
459	00:37:48	00:37:51	Fosters.
460	00:37:51	00:37:54	My parents had, like... dozens.
461	00:37:54	00:37:58	They'd come and go, some before I was born.
462	00:37:58	00:38:00	My mom loved kids.
463	00:38:00	00:38:03	Dad loved Mom.
464	00:38:03	00:38:06	I guess as soon as I came around...
465	00:38:06	00:38:08	the love ran out.
466	00:38:09	00:38:12	And then Mom dies...
467	00:38:12	00:38:14	the kids leave...
468	00:38:14	00:38:16	and Ernie's left with me.
469	00:38:22	00:38:25	Ernie didn't take a bullet for me.
470	00:38:28	00:38:30	But it's a beautiful thought.
471	00:38:33	00:38:36	I pulled these fibers out of her nasal passages.
472	00:38:37	00:38:41	Well,they appear to be consistent with the sofa pillow cushion at the scene.
473	00:38:41	00:38:43	COD was asphyxiation.
474	00:38:43	00:38:44	Now...
475	00:38:44	00:38:48	what is wrong with this brain?
476	00:38:48	00:38:50	Other than the fact that it's out of its skull?
477	00:38:50	00:38:52	Pigmentation's unusual.
478	00:38:53	00:38:55	Bingo... or keno or whatever you prefer.
479	00:38:55	00:39:00	Pronounced lack of pigmentation near the midbrain, along with...
480	00:39:00	00:39:03	clearly diminished substantia nigra.
481	00:39:03	00:39:04	She had Parkinson's.
482	00:39:06	00:39:09	Nick and Warrick did say that she was a little...
483	00:39:09	00:39:12	spacey when they met her, but they didn't mention any shaking.
484	00:39:12	00:39:14	Her disease was advanced.
485	00:39:14	00:39:16	She was on some pretty heavy meds.
486	00:39:16	00:39:18	Would they have shown up on a poison tox panel?
487	00:39:18	00:39:23	No, but those kinds of medications can cause abnormal thinking and behavior.
488	00:39:23	00:39:27	Takes somebody with a very strong will to keep it hidden.
489	00:39:29	00:39:32	Hey!
490	00:39:32	00:39:34	How'd it go with the Sheriff?
491	00:39:35	00:39:36	Media's all over him.
492	00:39:37	00:39:44	Which means he's all over the Undersheriff, who's all over Ecklie, who's blaming me for not going public with the Izzy Delancy Miniature like he told me to.
493	00:39:45	00:39:51	Well, I got the final trace report on the bleach water that spilled at the scene, but...
494	00:39:51	00:39:54	the fluid in the ear was biological.
495	00:39:54	00:39:55	Water and proteins.
496	00:39:56	00:39:59	Lipocalin, lactoferrin, lysozyme.
497	00:39:59	00:40:01	Tears.
498	00:40:01	00:40:02	Mm-hmm.
499	00:40:02	00:40:04	The victim was crying?
500	00:40:04	00:40:07	The smudges are from the pillow. There were no tear tracks.
501	00:40:07	00:40:09	I don't think the victim was crying.
502	00:40:09	00:40:11	I think the killer was.
503	00:40:18	00:40:24	When you cry, your tears sometimes can pick up skin cells from your cheek.
504	00:40:29	00:40:34	The DNA in your tears that were found on your sister's body prove that you were there.
505	00:40:36	00:40:39	I imagine it was the hardest thing you've ever done.
506	00:40:39	00:40:42	But you did it.
507	00:40:43	00:40:46	You should've seen Barbara when she was young.
508	00:40:50	00:40:52	She was fierce.
509	00:40:52	00:40:55	And fearless.
510	00:40:55	00:40:58	She protected me.
511	00:41:00	00:41:06	She was the smartest, the funniest, best friend I could ask for in life.
512	00:41:10	00:41:13	The Parkinson's just robbed her of everything.
513	00:41:13	00:41:15	She'd take medication; she'd go away.
514	00:41:15	00:41:16	She'd get off medication.
515	00:41:16	00:41:20	She'd become lucid again, only in agony.
516	00:41:22	00:41:26	She wanted to die in her own home.
517	00:41:26	00:41:32	There's no... assisted suicide protection in Nevada.
518	00:41:32	00:41:35	She said this was the perfect opportunity.
519	00:41:35	00:41:37	She could get what she wanted, and...
520	00:41:37	00:41:40	everyone would blame the Miniature Killer.
521	00:41:40	00:41:42	I understand.
522	00:41:44	00:41:47	You're under arrest.
523	00:41:58	00:42:02	We reran the footage several times to get a head count.
524	00:42:02	00:42:07	Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's 13 of them.
525	00:42:07	00:42:11	At this birthday party? Yeah.
526	00:42:11	00:42:15	Lionel only remembered the first names, and only a few of those.
527	00:42:15	00:42:17	Getting the DHS records is going to be tough.
528	00:42:17	00:42:21	Judges hate giving them out unless we can demonstrate a pressing need...
529	00:42:21	00:42:23	and even then, they're spotty.
530	00:42:23	00:42:27	And a lot of a foster kids change their names when they age out.
531	00:42:27	00:42:32	Ernie Dell confessed and killed himself to protect someone that he loved.
532	00:42:32	00:42:34	And that someone has murdered five people.
533	00:42:34	00:42:38	Eenie, meeny, miney, mo.
534	00:42:38	00:42:41	Catch a monster by the toe.
