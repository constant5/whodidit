0,00:00:11,00:00:13,(meowing)
1,00:00:21,00:00:24,(paper shuffling and tearing)
2,00:01:02,00:01:05,"Catherine, layout room, right away!"
3,00:01:20,00:01:23,"WILLOWS: Gil, where's the fire?"
4,00:01:36,00:01:38,It's been sitting in my office for the last four weeks.
5,00:01:39,00:01:40,But...
6,00:01:40,00:01:43,We caught the Miniature serial killer; he confessed.
7,00:01:43,00:01:45,"Yeah, I watched him blow his brains out."
8,00:01:45,00:01:49,But I think the package was postmarkedafter he killed himself.
9,00:01:49,00:01:53,So maybe he arranged to have it sent postmortem.
10,00:01:53,00:01:58,"The three other murders, the miniature was left at the scene."
11,00:01:58,00:01:59,This one was addressed to me.
12,00:02:01,00:02:03,"So, now it's personal?"
13,00:02:03,00:02:11,GRISSOM: The victim appears to be a Caucasian female with lots of books.
14,00:02:11,00:02:13,"It could be an office, somebody's living room..."
15,00:02:13,00:02:16,or a modern hotel lobby.
16,00:02:16,00:02:18,"When I was gone, did anybody work a scene like this?"
17,00:02:18,00:02:20,No... at least not on our shift.
18,00:02:22,00:02:26,"I'll check with days and swing, and see if anybody caught a case that matches."
19,00:02:26,00:02:28,Never mind.
20,00:02:28,00:02:28,Why not?
21,00:02:29,00:02:30,Take a look at the early edition.
22,00:02:40,00:02:42,It's dated the day after tomorrow.
23,00:02:42,00:02:46,This murder hasn't happened yet.
24,00:03:21,00:03:22,(camera shutter clicking)
25,00:03:29,00:03:32,My name is Ernest Edward Dell.
26,00:03:32,00:03:38,"I was born in 1946 in Ames, Iowa."
27,00:03:38,00:03:43,"My life's been hard, but I don't complain."
28,00:03:43,00:03:45,I never expected better.
29,00:03:47,00:03:49,I'm good with my hands.
30,00:03:49,00:03:51,I make things. I fix things.
31,00:03:51,00:03:53,I'm a handyman.
32,00:03:53,00:03:54,That's what I am.
33,00:03:55,00:03:58,I'm not the sociable type. I-I know that.
34,00:03:58,00:04:07,"You spend any amount of time around people, you get your heart broke-- treachery, hypocrisy..."
35,00:04:07,00:04:09,the promise of love.
36,00:04:09,00:04:14,A man has a right to an honest day's pay.
37,00:04:14,00:04:19,"Me, I service the machinery of death so that people can eat."
38,00:04:21,00:04:23,"If that makes me evil, then so be it."
39,00:04:23,00:04:28,The Miniature Killer murdered three people over a period of roughly six months.
40,00:04:28,00:04:31,Ernie Dell was either directly or indirectly related to all of them.
41,00:04:31,00:04:34,What's with the bloody dolls?
42,00:04:34,00:04:35,We're not sure.
43,00:04:35,00:04:40,There's a different perspective of that same image in all of the miniatures.
44,00:04:40,00:04:44,We're thinking it could be some kind of signature.
45,00:04:44,00:04:52,Look into the mouth of a person and you'll find lies wriggling there like maggots waiting to grow wings.
46,00:04:52,00:04:55,The world has... has gone mad.
47,00:04:55,00:05:05,"A man could kill from sunup to sunset, and still his work would never be done."
48,00:05:07,00:05:08,(gunshot)
49,00:05:14,00:05:15,Remember the Blue Paint killers?
50,00:05:15,00:05:18,Maybe Ernie Dell had a partner.
51,00:05:18,00:05:20,"Like an apprentice, an accomplice, something like that."
52,00:05:20,00:05:21,Or a disciple.
53,00:05:21,00:05:23,You guys make models when you were kids?
54,00:05:23,00:05:25,Tanks and airplanes.
55,00:05:25,00:05:26,Classic cars.
56,00:05:26,00:05:31,"These miniatures are obsessively precise, half-inch scale models of the crime scenes."
57,00:05:31,00:05:36,They probably took weeks of focused effort to create.
58,00:05:36,00:05:38,I don't think the killer's into team sports.
59,00:05:38,00:05:40,Izzy Delancy...
60,00:05:43,00:05:44,he was a rock star.
61,00:05:44,00:05:46,"You know, famous brings out the nut jobs."
62,00:05:46,00:05:48,Maybe we're just looking at a copycat.
63,00:05:48,00:05:50,The miniatures were never released to the press.
64,00:05:50,00:05:52,"No photos, nothing."
65,00:05:52,00:05:54,You can't copy what you can't see.
66,00:05:54,00:05:56,Other people had access to those files.
67,00:05:56,00:05:58,Maybe it was a cop.
68,00:05:58,00:06:00,Or somebody in the lab.
69,00:06:00,00:06:02,It's been known to happen.
70,00:06:04,00:06:08,"Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes the rap for three murders, and then eats a .38. Why?"
71,00:06:10,00:06:16,I think he was trying to protect someone-- someone that he cared alotabout.
72,00:06:32,00:06:36,Prints and DNA are going over the package and wrapping paper.
73,00:06:36,00:06:38,They won't find anything.
74,00:06:39,00:06:41,Return address was an empty lot.
75,00:06:44,00:06:45,Any clue as to who the victim is?
76,00:06:46,00:06:49,"No, I even went through her little purse."
77,00:06:53,00:06:54,"Well, she's not wearing a wedding ring."
78,00:06:54,00:06:57,She's probably single.
79,00:06:59,00:07:01,Her eyes appear to be bloodshot.
80,00:07:03,00:07:05,Petechial hemorrhaging?
81,00:07:07,00:07:09,GRISSOM: Look at this.
82,00:07:12,00:07:15,Blue smudges on the pillow.
83,00:07:15,00:07:18,Blue mascara on the victim.
84,00:07:24,00:07:29,"Our vic gets comfortable, grabs a little shut-eye..."
85,00:07:34,00:07:37,...and never wakes up.
86,00:07:39,00:07:41,She's going to be smothered.
87,00:07:41,00:07:43,It would seem so.
88,00:07:46,00:07:52,"WILLOWS: If you interpret this headline literally, the doll is the victim."
89,00:07:52,00:07:53,That's different than the others.
90,00:07:53,00:07:55,Methods change.
91,00:07:55,00:07:57,Killers evolve.
92,00:08:01,00:08:02,What?
93,00:08:02,00:08:04,Keppler said something like that once.
94,00:08:08,00:08:10,He did come down on the right side.
95,00:08:13,00:08:23,"GRISSOM: These books are all arranged by subject matter: art, religion, science..."
96,00:08:23,00:08:27,The victim is apparently well-educated.
97,00:08:37,00:08:39,That's from the Izzy Delancy miniature.
98,00:08:39,00:08:40,What's it doing here?
99,00:08:40,00:08:42,I don't know.
100,00:08:52,00:08:56,GRISSOM: There's something on the surface.
101,00:08:56,00:08:57,Looks like brush strokes.
102,00:09:30,00:09:33,(cart rattling)
103,00:09:47,00:09:49,"Hey, Sara, I heard we got another miniature."
104,00:09:49,00:09:50,Is that true?
105,00:09:50,00:09:54,"Yeah, it's like Ernie Dell was covering for someone."
106,00:09:55,00:09:57,No kidding?
107,00:09:57,00:10:00,"Hey, you were the one who checked for next of kin after his suicide, right?"
108,00:10:00,00:10:06,"SOP.Snail mail, email, bank accounts, police records, Google."
109,00:10:06,00:10:08,All I got was he's a widower.
110,00:10:08,00:10:10,Received his wife's Social Security benefits.
111,00:10:10,00:10:12,He had to be connected to somebody.
112,00:10:15,00:10:17,It's kind of early for court.
113,00:10:17,00:10:21,Finally rescheduled my deposition for the civil suit.
114,00:10:21,00:10:28,"You know, Demitrius James' family is suing the city for 3.5 million."
115,00:10:28,00:10:30,That's going to be a long deposition.
116,00:10:41,00:10:43,Home movies.
117,00:11:28,00:11:29,(knocking)
118,00:11:29,00:11:31,"Hey, boss. We're ordering out for breakfast."
119,00:11:32,00:11:33,"You have a cat, don't you, Hodges?"
120,00:11:33,00:11:34,Mr. K.
121,00:11:34,00:11:36,Kobayashi-Mare.
122,00:11:36,00:11:38,It's in reference to... Do you ever take him out of the house?
123,00:11:38,00:11:41,My little Kobe? No way.
124,00:11:41,00:11:43,Vegas is coyote country.
125,00:11:43,00:11:47,"So if this is a house cat, then this must be somebody's home."
126,00:11:47,00:11:49,"HODGES: Tsk, tsk."
127,00:11:49,00:11:51,Looks like he's been in the milk.
128,00:11:51,00:11:53,Yeah.
129,00:11:53,00:11:56,Maybe the victim has as well.
130,00:11:57,00:12:01,The previous murders have all involved the victim's habits and routines.
131,00:12:01,00:12:06,"So maybe this time, it's a little something extra in her afternoon tea."
132,00:12:10,00:12:12,So they're going to be poisoned.
133,00:12:16,00:12:23,"GRISSOM: She lays down for her usual nap, the cat sneaks a sip, and neither one ever wakes up again."
134,00:12:23,00:12:28,It doesn't matter how she dies if we can't figure out who she is or where she is.
135,00:12:29,00:12:31,"Well, you can't figure that out on an empty stomach."
136,00:12:31,00:12:36,"If you don't like this restaurant, there's plenty of others to choose from."
137,00:12:46,00:12:48,I choose these two.
138,00:13:24,00:13:30,BRASS: We're looking for a building whose exterior looks exactly like this.
139,00:13:34,00:13:35,"So what are we looking at, Rick?"
140,00:13:35,00:13:41,"We've got a modernist structure with cement beams steel rails, frosted glass."
141,00:13:41,00:13:43,Something like that.
142,00:13:43,00:13:46,"Probably, but whatever it is, it should match exactly."
143,00:13:46,00:13:47,The killer's hyper-specific.
144,00:13:47,00:13:49,"Well, maybe that'll work in our favor."
145,00:13:52,00:13:55,"Even if we find a match, we could already be too late."
146,00:14:04,00:14:06,Let's check it out.
147,00:14:07,00:14:09,"Nick Stokes, LVPD."
148,00:14:09,00:14:10,We're looking for a woman that lives in this building.
149,00:14:10,00:14:12,She looks like this.
150,00:14:12,00:14:13,Have you ever seen her?
151,00:14:13,00:14:16,That looks like a doll.
152,00:14:16,00:14:18,"Yeah, well, it's actually a death threat."
153,00:14:18,00:14:20,Time is of the essence here.
154,00:14:20,00:14:23,Can you help us out? Anyone in the building look like this? No.
155,00:14:23,00:14:25,"She's got a cat. Well, that narrows it down to about a hundred tenants."
156,00:14:27,00:14:28,That's her home.
157,00:14:28,00:14:30,1106. That's Ms. Tallman's place.
158,00:14:33,00:14:35,(muffled music plays)
159,00:14:40,00:14:42,(music grows louder)
160,00:14:44,00:14:46,(knocking)
161,00:14:46,00:14:48,Ms. Tallman? Las Vegas Police.
162,00:14:48,00:14:50,"You need to open your door, please."
163,00:14:56,00:14:58,Ms. Tallman?
164,00:14:59,00:15:00,Open and stand clear.
165,00:15:04,00:15:06,(loud music blasting)
166,00:15:27,00:15:29,(door opens)
167,00:15:33,00:15:35,(singing along)
168,00:15:41,00:15:42,(screaming)
169,00:15:44,00:15:45,"(music continues blasting) Please, ma'am, calm down."
170,00:15:45,00:15:46,We're with the Crime Lab.
171,00:15:46,00:15:48,This isn't a lab. This is my home.
172,00:15:49,00:15:50,You must be confused.
173,00:15:50,00:15:53,"No, we're not confused. We're here for your protection."
174,00:15:53,00:15:54,(clicks music off)
175,00:15:56,00:15:57,Ms. Tallman...
176,00:15:57,00:16:00,Dr. Tallman.
177,00:16:00,00:16:02,Dr. Tallman...
178,00:16:02,00:16:04,I need you to take a look at this.
179,00:16:06,00:16:08,Did you make this for me?
180,00:16:08,00:16:10,That's very sweet.
181,00:16:10,00:16:11,It's a death threat.
182,00:16:11,00:16:13,Who would want to kill me?
183,00:16:13,00:16:20,"Doctor, do you normally take a nap around the same time every day covering your face and eyes with the pillow?"
184,00:16:21,00:16:22,"Yes, at 4:00 p.m."
185,00:16:22,00:16:28,I... I have tea and cookies every day when I wake up.
186,00:16:28,00:16:30,Have you been watching me?
187,00:16:30,00:16:33,"No, Miss, no, but we think someone else has."
188,00:16:33,00:16:35,"Doctor, your life is in danger."
189,00:16:35,00:16:36,"We need you to get dressed and come with us, please."
190,00:16:38,00:16:40,Am I in trouble?
191,00:16:40,00:16:41,"STOKES: No, ma'am."
192,00:16:41,00:16:43,"No, not anymore."
193,00:16:43,00:16:46,"This officer will help you get your things, okay?"
194,00:16:46,00:16:48,"No, no, no."
195,00:16:48,00:16:51,I'll go get my things.
196,00:16:51,00:16:56,I want you to know that you young men are refreshingly polite.
197,00:16:57,00:16:58,Thank you.
198,00:17:02,00:17:04,Is she on something?
199,00:17:04,00:17:06,She may have already been poisoned.
200,00:17:06,00:17:07,We'll get her to the hospital.
201,00:17:08,00:17:09,We should collect blood for tox.
202,00:17:09,00:17:11,And any open food or drink.
203,00:17:12,00:17:14,"Hey, go on, shoo!"
204,00:17:14,00:17:17,The killer did plan every detail.
205,00:17:17,00:17:19,Except for us showing up.
206,00:17:23,00:17:26,"(static, bell dinging, kids laughing)"
207,00:17:36,00:17:38,That's got to be Ernie Dell's wife.
208,00:17:38,00:17:40,Quite the bash.
209,00:17:40,00:17:43,"(train whistle blows, kids laughing)"
210,00:17:43,00:17:44,They must love kids.
211,00:17:46,00:17:48,"(singing ""Happy Birthday To You"")"
212,00:17:48,00:17:50,Is that Ernie's son?
213,00:17:50,00:17:53,"There's no record of a son, but it sure looks like it."
214,00:17:53,00:17:58,"SIDLE: One, two, three, four, five birthday candles in 1988 would make him around 24 now."
215,00:17:58,00:18:00,(all laughing)
216,00:18:05,00:18:09,JOHNSON: Hmm. Don't look like a very happy birthday.
217,00:18:10,00:18:11,Did you get the boy's name?
218,00:18:12,00:18:14,Cake never made it on camera.
219,00:18:14,00:18:15,How about audio?
220,00:18:15,00:18:22,"It sucks. '80s video cam with built-in, non-directional mic, pulls in nothing but wind and train noise."
221,00:18:22,00:18:23,So let's process it.
222,00:18:23,00:18:25,This is processed.
223,00:18:30,00:18:34,We ran tox on Ms. Tallman's blood as well as her milk and cookies.
224,00:18:34,00:18:40,"She was negative on everything from pharmaceuticals and illicits, to herbicides, pesticides and heavy metals."
225,00:18:40,00:18:41,You sure she was going to be poisoned?
226,00:18:41,00:18:44,"No, but I'm pretty sure she was scheduled to die today."
227,00:18:44,00:18:47,"In each of the previous cases, the killer was at the scene to commit the murder."
228,00:18:47,00:18:51,So maybe he was planning to show up at the condo.
229,00:18:51,00:18:54,"Well, it'd be kind of rude not to greet him, don't you think?"
230,00:19:10,00:19:13,I'm ready for my close-up.
231,00:19:17,00:19:19,Definitely beats walking the beat.
232,00:19:22,00:19:24,Feed's good.
233,00:19:24,00:19:26,"Officer Kamen, how's your read?"
234,00:19:29,00:19:31,Time to go to sleep.
235,00:19:36,00:19:39,"All units, this is Brass."
236,00:19:39,00:19:41,Maintain a low profile.
237,00:19:41,00:19:44,"That means I don't want to see a uniform within three blocks of this place, okay?"
238,00:20:02,00:20:04,Where you headed? 11.
239,00:20:08,00:20:11,"Oh, sorry. Ten."
240,00:20:13,00:20:15,Go on up.
241,00:20:20,00:20:21,(elevator bell dings)
242,00:20:28,00:20:30,MAN: Hold the elevator.
243,00:20:31,00:20:33,What floor?
244,00:20:34,00:20:36,11.
245,00:20:40,00:20:41,Someone's coming up.
246,00:20:41,00:20:43,White male with a suitcase.
247,00:20:59,00:21:01,We got a possible.
248,00:21:03,00:21:05,LVPD. Up against the wall.
249,00:21:05,00:21:07,What? She said hands against the wall.
250,00:21:09,00:21:11,"What's your business here, sir? Nothing."
251,00:21:11,00:21:13,"I mean, this is my sister's place."
252,00:21:13,00:21:15,I'm Peyton Tallman.
253,00:21:15,00:21:17,Where's Barbara? Did something happen to her?
254,00:21:20,00:21:24,This officer will explain everything to your satisfaction. Get him out of here.
255,00:21:24,00:21:26,What?
256,00:21:27,00:21:29,BRASS (on phone): Peyton Tallman's ID checks out.
257,00:21:29,00:21:33,And I kind of doubt the killer's going to make a miniature crime scene of his own sister's house.
258,00:21:33,00:21:36,And we have nothing to link him to the other three murders?
259,00:21:36,00:21:38,He wants to see his sister.
260,00:21:38,00:21:39,I'll let you know how that goes down.
261,00:21:39,00:21:41,Okay. Thanks.
262,00:21:42,00:21:44,(phone beeps off)
263,00:22:07,00:22:08,"Okay, that's it."
264,00:22:09,00:22:10,Killer's not gonna show.
265,00:22:12,00:22:14,Let's call it a night.
266,00:22:31,00:22:37,"All right, I know you must be exhausted after your brutal day in the field, but it's time to go."
267,00:22:39,00:22:41,Officer Kamen?
268,00:22:49,00:22:52,"(camera shutter clicking, garbled radio transmission)"
269,00:22:54,00:22:57,She's pale.
270,00:22:57,00:22:59,No sign of trauma.
271,00:22:59,00:23:00,COD'll have to wait till autopsy.
272,00:23:00,00:23:02,Sorry.
273,00:23:02,00:23:04,Not as sorry as I am.
274,00:23:04,00:23:06,(garbled radio transmission)
275,00:23:46,00:23:51,"Look, I know we've all had a tough day, but the sooner we get done here, the sooner we can all go home."
276,00:23:51,00:23:54,(sniffles) Why? So my little Tripper can run out to greet me?
277,00:23:54,00:23:55,Barbara.
278,00:23:55,00:23:57,"I'm sorry about your cat, ma'am. We lost an officer."
279,00:23:57,00:23:59,"How much did you love her? Barbara, please."
280,00:23:59,00:24:04,"When my guys went to your house, they said you were a little out of it, but you're thinking clearly now, right?"
281,00:24:04,00:24:05,(scoffs)
282,00:24:05,00:24:07,"Well, having your home invaded can be a little bracing."
283,00:24:07,00:24:09,"Captain, how can we help?"
284,00:24:09,00:24:12,Can you tell me why anyone would want to kill you?
285,00:24:12,00:24:13,No.
286,00:24:13,00:24:15,But you can.
287,00:24:15,00:24:17,"Well, Barbara was a highly regarded psychotherapist."
288,00:24:17,00:24:19,Is.
289,00:24:19,00:24:20,That hasn't changed.
290,00:24:20,00:24:21,Is or was?
291,00:24:21,00:24:23,I'm retired.
292,00:24:23,00:24:24,You seem a little young to be retired.
293,00:24:24,00:24:26,I got tired of it.
294,00:24:26,00:24:29,Can you tell me why one of her patients would want to kill her?
295,00:24:29,00:24:30,No.
296,00:24:30,00:24:31,"Well, no, it's-it's possible."
297,00:24:31,00:24:37,"She, um... she counseled a lot of at-risk adults, um, halfway house kids, pro bono."
298,00:24:37,00:24:41,I also treated suburban sexual dysfunction for $300 an hour.
299,00:24:41,00:24:42,PEYTON: She helped a lot of people.
300,00:24:43,00:24:44,Did you work out of your home?
301,00:24:44,00:24:46,For the last few years.
302,00:24:46,00:24:48,Treat any sociopaths?
303,00:24:48,00:24:51,(laughs) That's not a term for which there's any diagnostic criteria.
304,00:24:51,00:24:53,You're not looking for one of my patients.
305,00:24:53,00:24:54,"Well, maybe I am."
306,00:24:54,00:24:57,"Maybe I'm looking for a 20-something-year-old male, last name of Dell."
307,00:24:57,00:24:58,Won't say.
308,00:24:58,00:24:59,She can't say.
309,00:25:00,00:25:01,It's doctor-patient confidentiality.
310,00:25:01,00:25:02,But you're retired.
311,00:25:02,00:25:03,"Well, you know where I live. Are you done yet?"
312,00:25:03,00:25:06,"No, we're not done yet. At least, I'm not done yet."
313,00:25:06,00:25:09,"All right, look, let's start again, all right?"
314,00:25:09,00:25:10,Let's...
315,00:25:10,00:25:13,"Maybe we started off on the wrong foot, all right?"
316,00:25:13,00:25:19,"Look, I'm asking you as a professional, as a psychotherapist, please... help me out here."
317,00:25:22,00:25:26,Okay? Tell me... what am I looking for?
318,00:25:33,00:25:35,Repetition...
319,00:25:35,00:25:40,attention to detail indicates obsessive-compulsive disorder.
320,00:25:40,00:25:43,Obvious antisocial personality.
321,00:25:43,00:25:47,"Uh, yeah, four bodies-- I'd call that antisocial."
322,00:25:48,00:25:54,"Most murderers lack impulse control, inability to plan ahead, but..."
323,00:25:54,00:25:56,this one's different.
324,00:25:57,00:25:59,Different how?
325,00:26:02,00:26:04,He conceives murder...
326,00:26:04,00:26:06,visualizes it.
327,00:26:08,00:26:10,Then he takes all that horror that he's imagined.
328,00:26:10,00:26:12,He compresses it into these little rooms.
329,00:26:12,00:26:17,These models literally indicate repressed rage.
330,00:26:19,00:26:25,"And when you start taking that apart, all that rage comes flying out..."
331,00:26:26,00:26:31,...and you will have let the monster out of the box.
332,00:26:41,00:26:43,"Stop hovering, Hodges."
333,00:26:43,00:26:44,You're in or you're out.
334,00:26:44,00:26:45,In.
335,00:26:49,00:26:51,"So, she wasn't poisoned, huh?"
336,00:26:51,00:26:52,No.
337,00:26:52,00:26:54,Hand me a scalpel.
338,00:27:07,00:27:09,Tweezers.
339,00:27:21,00:27:24,Nice lungs.
340,00:27:46,00:27:48,(computer beeps)
341,00:27:48,00:27:50,"(phone ringing, beep)"
342,00:27:52,00:27:54,Grissom.
343,00:27:54,00:28:00,"ROBBINS: Yeah, Gil, uh, got a good idea on COD for your asphyxiated officer."
344,00:28:00,00:28:05,Internal organ color nailed it on both the autopsy and necropsy as...
345,00:28:05,00:28:07,Carbon monoxide poisoning.
346,00:28:07,00:28:10,"You know, nobody likes when you do that."
347,00:28:10,00:28:13,"So, how did CO get into the room?"
348,00:28:13,00:28:15,That I don't know.
349,00:28:15,00:28:17,(phone beeps off)
350,00:28:17,00:28:19,(beeping)
351,00:28:21,00:28:25,(beeps)
352,00:28:25,00:28:28,(trilling and beeps)
353,00:28:29,00:28:31,(beep)
354,00:29:03,00:29:13,"STOKES: The timer goes off, activating the motor, which closes the flue and drops powdered charcoal onto the flames, producing carbon monoxide."
355,00:29:13,00:29:19,"Fumes have nowhere to go but out into the apartment, into Officer Kamen."
356,00:29:19,00:29:21,And the cat.
357,00:29:21,00:29:24,"You know, this timer was geared to run for weeks."
358,00:29:24,00:29:28,It could have easily been put in place a month ago.
359,00:29:28,00:29:31,That's why the killer felt safe enough to send me the miniature.
360,00:29:31,00:29:33,He never intended to be at the scene.
361,00:29:33,00:29:35,There was no danger of being caught.
362,00:29:37,00:29:40,"Hey, Sara, check this out."
363,00:29:40,00:29:42,I was digging through Mannleigh Chicken's employee health insurance records...
364,00:29:43,00:29:47,"45 million Americans without health coverage, and a chicken slaughterhouse provides medical benefits?"
365,00:29:47,00:29:52,Izzy Delancy's animal rights PSA forced the company to clean up its act in all departments.
366,00:29:52,00:29:56,"Anyway, Ernie Dell had one dependent listed: a son."
367,00:29:56,00:29:58,"""Lionel Dell."" Unbelievable."
368,00:29:58,00:30:00,"Yeah, the man loved his trains."
369,00:30:00,00:30:04,"Lionel changed his name to Mitchell Douglas after he turned 18, and get this."
370,00:30:04,00:30:07,He did time in a halfway house after getting busted for fentanyl.
371,00:30:07,00:30:11,"Which connects him to the fentanyl-dealing sexagenarian, Penny Garden."
372,00:30:11,00:30:13,Where's young Dell now?
373,00:30:17,00:30:19,Lionel Dell?
374,00:30:22,00:30:24,My name is Mitch Douglas.
375,00:30:24,00:30:27,I'm Sara Sidle. I'm with the Crime Lab.
376,00:30:27,00:30:29,I was wondering if you knew this woman.
377,00:30:29,00:30:32,She used to sell fentanyl.
378,00:30:32,00:30:35,Want me to pee in a cup?
379,00:30:36,00:30:38,"What about this guy? He's dead, too."
380,00:30:39,00:30:43,He was found face down in a chicken stun bath in a place your dad used to work.
381,00:30:43,00:30:46,He worked a lot of places.
382,00:30:47,00:30:49,I met a lot of people.
383,00:30:51,00:30:54,Did you know Izzy Delancy?
384,00:30:54,00:30:57,Yeah.
385,00:30:57,00:30:59,His music sucks.
386,00:31:01,00:31:03,What do all these stiffs got to do with me?
387,00:31:03,00:31:06,What was your relationship like with your father?
388,00:31:06,00:31:09,Before or after he blew his brains out?
389,00:31:09,00:31:11,Let's start with... before.
390,00:31:11,00:31:17,"You ever step in a pile of crap, but you're wearing boots, so you can't just scrape it off."
391,00:31:18,00:31:25,"You got to dig it out with a stick, but even that doesn't work, so you just end up tossing the boots in the trash?"
392,00:31:25,00:31:27,It was kind of like that.
393,00:31:27,00:31:29,And after?
394,00:31:29,00:31:31,Much better.
395,00:31:33,00:31:34,You gonna arrest me?
396,00:31:35,00:31:37,We're just talking.
397,00:31:37,00:31:39,I'm not.
398,00:32:03,00:32:05,(knocking)
399,00:32:07,00:32:09,Did you know Officer Kamen?
400,00:32:09,00:32:11,No.
401,00:32:11,00:32:13,"Me, neither."
402,00:32:16,00:32:20,"I was watching her die, and I didn't even realize it."
403,00:32:22,00:32:28,"Look, Sofia, there weren't any carbon monoxide sensors in the apartment, so no one could have known."
404,00:32:28,00:32:29,Yeah.
405,00:32:29,00:32:35,"And in fact, if I hadn't have gone away, we'd have had another month to work with; you'd have never been in that position."
406,00:32:37,00:32:41,"It doesn't make you feel any better either, does it?"
407,00:32:46,00:32:48,"You know, the scene's been released."
408,00:32:48,00:32:51,Ms. Tallman was pretty insistent.
409,00:32:51,00:32:55,"We offered to leave a uniform with her, but she wasn't having it."
410,00:32:57,00:33:01,"So, what are you looking for?"
411,00:33:01,00:33:03,The miniature's complete.
412,00:33:03,00:33:05,"It's not perfect, though."
413,00:33:05,00:33:09,Officer Kamen was not the intended victim.
414,00:33:09,00:33:11,"Well, she was dressed like her."
415,00:33:11,00:33:13,She died in the right position.
416,00:33:14,00:33:15,So did the cat.
417,00:33:15,00:33:18,I'm still not sure it's perfect enough.
418,00:33:18,00:33:20,(phone rings)
419,00:33:22,00:33:23,Grissom.
420,00:33:23,00:33:25,Yeah.
421,00:33:27,00:33:30,Okay.
422,00:33:34,00:33:36,"Now, it's perfect."
423,00:33:41,00:33:43,(camera shutter clicking)
424,00:33:43,00:33:45,(garbled radio transmission)
425,00:33:45,00:33:48,(camera shutter clicking)
426,00:33:59,00:34:00,(camera shutter clicking)
427,00:34:08,00:34:10,It's déjà vu all over again.
428,00:34:10,00:34:13,Not entirely.
429,00:34:13,00:34:15,There's some kind of liquid.
430,00:34:15,00:34:17,It looks like it fell and splashes on the floor...
431,00:34:18,00:34:19,on the body...
432,00:34:19,00:34:21,and it looks like...
433,00:34:21,00:34:23,the ear.
434,00:34:29,00:34:31,This could be the source.
435,00:34:31,00:34:34,WILLOWS: Killer returns to...
436,00:34:34,00:34:36,complete the miniature the old-fashioned way.
437,00:34:36,00:34:37,And things get a little messy.
438,00:34:37,00:34:39,But in the end...
439,00:34:39,00:34:42,he puts everything right back where it belongs.
440,00:34:42,00:34:48,TALLMAN: What happened to my sister was not just some isolated tragedy.
441,00:34:48,00:34:57,"There have been four other murders, four deaths which could have been prevented had the public been warned by the people sworn to protect us."
442,00:34:57,00:35:01,Barbara Tallman was the latest victim of a serial killer...
443,00:35:01,00:35:04,the LVPD has known about for months.
444,00:35:04,00:35:05,What do they call him?
445,00:35:05,00:35:14,"They call him ""The Miniature Killer,"" because he makes little models of his victims posed in the places where they die."
446,00:35:14,00:35:17,"I feel for the guy, but he just made our job a lot harder."
447,00:35:17,00:35:19,It was inevitable.
448,00:35:19,00:35:23,"With each murder, the amount of information that could leak rose exponentially."
449,00:35:23,00:35:29,"TALLMAN: I'm a private person, but if this prevents just one tragedy, then it's worth it."
450,00:35:31,00:35:34,Trace report on the second crime scene or...
451,00:35:35,00:35:36,or should I say second murder?
452,00:35:36,00:35:38,Crime scene is the same.
453,00:35:38,00:35:44,"Haven't finished processing all the samples, but the water from the vase is consistent with the water found on the victim's clothing."
454,00:35:44,00:35:46,There's chlorine bleach in the samples.
455,00:35:46,00:35:48,Why put bleach in vase water?
456,00:35:48,00:35:50,I knew you'd ask that.
457,00:35:50,00:35:53,"Well, I had this girlfriend who was a florist..."
458,00:35:53,00:35:55,The one with the water retention problem.
459,00:35:55,00:35:57,You remembered.
460,00:35:57,00:35:59,Anyway...
461,00:35:59,00:36:05,"she said that if you add a few drops of bleach to your water, it kills bacteria, and gives your flowers a nice long life, but add too much..."
462,00:36:05,00:36:07,the flowers die.
463,00:36:09,00:36:12,"Grissom, we may have caught a break on Barbara Tallman."
464,00:36:12,00:36:14,She did pro bono work at Lionel Dell's halfway house.
465,00:36:17,00:36:19,"Okay, so maybe I met her. So what?"
466,00:36:19,00:36:21,"CURTIS: So, she's dead."
467,00:36:21,00:36:25,"That's four stiffs associated with you, Lionel."
468,00:36:27,00:36:29,"Five, if you count Ernie."
469,00:36:29,00:36:31,I don't.
470,00:36:31,00:36:34,"You know, you keep saying that you hated your dad, but I'm not buying it."
471,00:36:34,00:36:36,You go through your life alone.
472,00:36:36,00:36:38,You're good with your hands. You have weird hobbies.
473,00:36:38,00:36:40,You make little things.
474,00:36:40,00:36:42,And when that gets tricky...
475,00:36:43,00:36:45,you call your father.
476,00:36:45,00:36:49,CURTIS: Maybe Ernie didn't know you were a killer.
477,00:36:49,00:36:53,"Police start poking around, asking questions, showing him pictures."
478,00:36:53,00:36:55,And when Ernie sees these...
479,00:36:55,00:36:59,he knows exactly what his little boy's become.
480,00:36:59,00:37:02,"SIDLE: To the rest of the world, a monster, but to him..."
481,00:37:02,00:37:06,just a little boy knocking over his birthday cake.
482,00:37:08,00:37:11,"So he confesses to crimes you committed, shoots himself in the head; It's a dead end for us."
483,00:37:11,00:37:13,New start for you.
484,00:37:17,00:37:20,If only.
485,00:37:20,00:37:23,Let me tell you about Ernie.
486,00:37:23,00:37:27,What he cared about in this life was...
487,00:37:28,00:37:33,"his wife, his trains, and his kids."
488,00:37:33,00:37:35,In that order.
489,00:37:35,00:37:38,Kids? You're an only child.
490,00:37:38,00:37:41,"Again, if only."
491,00:37:41,00:37:44,"If you're looking for a love connection, then..."
492,00:37:45,00:37:47,then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.
493,00:37:47,00:37:48,What are you talking about?
494,00:37:48,00:37:51,Fosters.
495,00:37:51,00:37:54,"My parents had, like... dozens."
496,00:37:54,00:37:58,"They'd come and go, some before I was born."
497,00:37:58,00:38:00,My mom loved kids.
498,00:38:00,00:38:03,Dad loved Mom.
499,00:38:03,00:38:06,I guess as soon as I came around...
500,00:38:06,00:38:08,the love ran out.
501,00:38:09,00:38:12,And then Mom dies...
502,00:38:12,00:38:14,the kids leave...
503,00:38:14,00:38:16,and Ernie's left with me.
504,00:38:22,00:38:25,Ernie didn't take a bullet for me.
505,00:38:28,00:38:30,But it's a beautiful thought.
506,00:38:33,00:38:36,I pulled these fibers out of her nasal passages.
507,00:38:37,00:38:41,"Well,they appear to be consistent with the sofa pillow cushion at the scene."
508,00:38:41,00:38:43,COD was asphyxiation.
509,00:38:43,00:38:44,Now...
510,00:38:44,00:38:48,what is wrong with this brain?
511,00:38:48,00:38:50,Other than the fact that it's out of its skull?
512,00:38:50,00:38:52,Pigmentation's unusual.
513,00:38:53,00:38:55,Bingo... or keno or whatever you prefer.
514,00:38:55,00:39:00,"Pronounced lack of pigmentation near the midbrain, along with..."
515,00:39:00,00:39:03,clearly diminished substantia nigra.
516,00:39:03,00:39:04,She had Parkinson's.
517,00:39:06,00:39:09,Nick and Warrick did say that she was a little...
518,00:39:09,00:39:12,"spacey when they met her, but they didn't mention any shaking."
519,00:39:12,00:39:14,Her disease was advanced.
520,00:39:14,00:39:16,She was on some pretty heavy meds.
521,00:39:16,00:39:18,Would they have shown up on a poison tox panel?
522,00:39:18,00:39:23,"No, but those kinds of medications can cause abnormal thinking and behavior."
523,00:39:23,00:39:27,Takes somebody with a very strong will to keep it hidden.
524,00:39:29,00:39:32,WILLOWS: Hey!
525,00:39:32,00:39:34,How'd it go with the Sheriff?
526,00:39:35,00:39:36,Media's all over him.
527,00:39:37,00:39:44,"Which means he's all over the Undersheriff, who's all over Ecklie, who's blaming me for not going public with the Izzy Delancy Miniature like he told me to."
528,00:39:45,00:39:51,"Well, I got the final trace report on the bleach water that spilled at the scene, but..."
529,00:39:51,00:39:54,the fluid in the ear was biological.
530,00:39:54,00:39:55,Water and proteins.
531,00:39:56,00:39:59,"Lipocalin, lactoferrin, lysozyme."
532,00:39:59,00:40:01,Tears.
533,00:40:01,00:40:02,Mm-hmm.
534,00:40:02,00:40:04,The victim was crying?
535,00:40:04,00:40:07,The smudges are from the pillow. There were no tear tracks.
536,00:40:07,00:40:09,I don't think the victim was crying.
537,00:40:09,00:40:11,I think the killer was.
538,00:40:18,00:40:24,"WILLOWS: When you cry, your tears sometimes can pick up skin cells from your cheek."
539,00:40:29,00:40:34,The DNA in your tears that were found on your sister's body prove that you were there.
540,00:40:36,00:40:39,I imagine it was the hardest thing you've ever done.
541,00:40:39,00:40:42,But you did it.
542,00:40:43,00:40:46,You should've seen Barbara when she was young.
543,00:40:50,00:40:52,She was fierce.
544,00:40:52,00:40:55,And fearless.
545,00:40:55,00:40:58,She protected me.
546,00:41:00,00:41:06,"She was the smartest, the funniest, best friend I could ask for in life."
547,00:41:10,00:41:13,The Parkinson's just robbed her of everything.
548,00:41:13,00:41:15,She'd take medication; she'd go away.
549,00:41:15,00:41:16,She'd get off medication.
550,00:41:16,00:41:20,"She'd become lucid again, only in agony."
551,00:41:22,00:41:26,She wanted to die in her own home.
552,00:41:26,00:41:32,There's no... assisted suicide protection in Nevada.
553,00:41:32,00:41:35,She said this was the perfect opportunity.
554,00:41:35,00:41:37,"She could get what she wanted, and..."
555,00:41:37,00:41:40,everyone would blame the Miniature Killer.
556,00:41:40,00:41:42,I understand.
557,00:41:44,00:41:47,You're under arrest.
558,00:41:58,00:42:02,We reran the footage several times to get a head count.
559,00:42:02,00:42:07,"Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's 13 of them."
560,00:42:07,00:42:11,At this birthday party? Yeah.
561,00:42:11,00:42:15,"Lionel only remembered the first names, and only a few of those."
562,00:42:15,00:42:17,Getting the DHS records is going to be tough.
563,00:42:17,00:42:21,Judges hate giving them out unless we can demonstrate a pressing need...
564,00:42:21,00:42:23,"and even then, they're spotty."
565,00:42:23,00:42:27,And a lot of a foster kids change their names when they age out.
566,00:42:27,00:42:32,Ernie Dell confessed and killed himself to protect someone that he loved.
567,00:42:32,00:42:34,And that someone has murdered five people.
568,00:42:34,00:42:38,"Eenie, meeny, miney, mo."
569,00:42:38,00:42:41,Catch a monster by the toe.
