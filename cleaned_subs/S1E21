3,00:00:43,00:00:45,"Ah, Jeez."
4,00:00:47,00:00:48,"All right, guy?"
5,00:00:50,00:00:52,I guess he won't be eating dinner tonight.
6,00:01:00,00:01:06,I think Running Man was attacked up there and then dragged or slid down here.
7,00:01:10,00:01:12,Look at those wounds.
8,00:01:12,00:01:15,STOKES: He picked the wrong time of day to be running alone.
9,00:01:15,00:01:17,Dusk is when the animals come out.
10,00:01:17,00:01:21,"BROWN: Yeah, from what I hear they carved out a piece of this valley when they made the park."
11,00:01:21,00:01:25,Some mountain lion probably didn't like getting relocated.
12,00:01:25,00:01:27,Mountain lions are brutal.
13,00:01:27,00:01:28,And smart.
14,00:01:28,00:01:32,This one evidently knows how to use a scalpel.

16,00:02:17,00:02:18,What are you doing?
17,00:02:18,00:02:20,The carnival case.
18,00:02:20,00:02:21,I'm taking it.
19,00:02:22,00:02:22,The carnival case?
20,00:02:22,00:02:27,A six-year-old girl died on a ride at the carnival over on Washington.
21,00:02:27,00:02:28,The paperwork's on your desk.
22,00:02:28,00:02:31,Did you straighten up my office while you were in there?
23,00:02:31,00:02:33,You think I overstepped?
24,00:02:33,00:02:36,These people come to town they commit crimes and they leave.
25,00:02:36,00:02:39,I just want to get there before the carnival moves on.
26,00:02:39,00:02:42,Okay. Take Sara with you.
27,00:02:42,00:02:45,She's meeting me there.
28,00:02:45,00:02:49,"BROWN: So, Doc how big of a cat are we actually dealing with here?"
29,00:02:49,00:02:50,We're not.
30,00:02:50,00:02:52,We're not?
31,00:02:52,00:02:53,You ever owned a kitten?
32,00:02:53,00:02:56,"When you play with them, they don't just bite, they scratch."
33,00:02:56,00:02:58,Doesn't matter whether they're tabbies or tigers.
34,00:02:58,00:03:00,And there's no signs of claw wounds on the victim.
35,00:03:03,00:03:04,So what are we dealing with?
36,00:03:04,00:03:05,Forget Whiskers.
37,00:03:05,00:03:06,Think Spot.
38,00:03:06,00:03:08,Teeth marks look canine.
39,00:03:10,00:03:12,I was wrong about the species.
40,00:03:12,00:03:15,I'll make a mold of the bite.
41,00:03:15,00:03:19,If we're lucky we can narrow it down to breed.
42,00:03:21,00:03:22,What?
43,00:03:22,00:03:24,Most people don't admit when they're wrong.
44,00:03:24,00:03:26,I'm wrong all the time.
45,00:03:26,00:03:28,That's how I eventually get to right.
46,00:03:28,00:03:30,ROBBINS: You weren't wrong about the scalpel.
47,00:03:30,00:03:33,Whoever removed this guys organs knew how to handle one.
48,00:03:33,00:03:37,STOKES: So a dog killed him then someone came along and cut him up.
49,00:03:37,00:03:40,GRISSOM: Someone with two legs and a medical degree.
50,00:03:57,00:03:59,Stop.
51,00:03:59,00:04:00,What are you doing?
52,00:04:00,00:04:01,That bag's been used 100 times.
53,00:04:01,00:04:02,Get her a new one.
54,00:04:02,00:04:04,"They get washed every time, right?"
55,00:04:04,00:04:05,"Yeah, with disinfectant."
56,00:04:05,00:04:08,What if it was your kid?
57,00:04:10,00:04:12,She gets this one.
58,00:04:12,00:04:14,"Yes, ma'am."
59,00:04:19,00:04:21,She looks scared.
60,00:04:21,00:04:24,No six-year-old should have to go through that.
61,00:04:25,00:04:26,You okay?
62,00:04:30,00:04:33,Why don't you go find the mother and talk to her.
63,00:04:33,00:04:34,I'll take the crime scene.
64,00:04:34,00:04:36,Okay.
65,00:04:40,00:04:43,I don't know what happened.
66,00:04:43,00:04:50,"One minute Sandy was laughing, holding my hand, and the next..."
67,00:04:50,00:04:53,"The next, sh..."
68,00:04:55,00:04:57,"Oh, my God."
69,00:05:03,00:05:04,Mommy!
70,00:05:07,00:05:08,Sandy!
71,00:05:08,00:05:11,"Sandy, where are you?"
72,00:05:11,00:05:12,I...
73,00:05:12,00:05:17,I got out of the car...
74,00:05:18,00:05:21,but I couldn't find her.
75,00:05:21,00:05:26,By the time I got the operator to stop the ride...
76,00:05:27,00:05:29,she was dead.
77,00:05:29,00:05:32,MAN: How can this happen?
78,00:05:32,00:05:34,At a carnival.
79,00:05:36,00:05:38,"""Go back to the crime scene."
80,00:05:38,00:05:44,"Collect the dog's scat."" I didn't realize how many dogs take their walks up here when I said that."
81,00:05:44,00:05:47,"BROWN: Yeah, but I bet Grissom did."
82,00:05:47,00:05:49,This sucks.
83,00:05:51,00:05:52,"But it's evidence, right?"
84,00:05:52,00:05:54,"No, hair and fiber is evidence, Warrick."
85,00:05:54,00:05:55,This is combat duty.
86,00:05:55,00:05:57,"Yeah, it's somebody's doody."
87,00:05:57,00:05:59,STOKES: Don't even waste your time.
88,00:05:59,00:06:01,That's cougar.
89,00:06:01,00:06:02,How do you figure that?
90,00:06:04,00:06:06,See the rabbit hair in the feces?
91,00:06:06,00:06:08,Don't you remember the seminar?
92,00:06:08,00:06:10,Seminar?
93,00:06:10,00:06:11,Julie.
94,00:06:11,00:06:15,"Julie, oh..."
95,00:06:15,00:06:17,A CSI should not be that fine.
96,00:06:17,00:06:18,(chuckles)
97,00:06:22,00:06:23,What is that?
98,00:06:27,00:06:30,STOKES: Looks like dirty ice.
99,00:06:30,00:06:32,"Yeah, well, I'm taking it into evidence."
100,00:06:32,00:06:35,"It's evidence of a picnic, Warrick."
101,00:06:37,00:06:40,"Yeah, well..."
102,00:06:40,00:06:41,we'll see.
103,00:06:42,00:06:44,We've never had a problem with this ride.
104,00:06:44,00:06:46,This is the safest ride we got.
105,00:06:46,00:06:49,Not anymore.
106,00:06:49,00:06:53,"So you didn't know that anything was wrong until this car came out of the tunnel, right?"
107,00:06:53,00:06:55,As soon as the Mom started screaming I stopped the ride.
108,00:07:02,00:07:03,Seat belt's loose.
109,00:07:04,00:07:05,I check those every morning.
110,00:07:05,00:07:07,Did you check this one?
111,00:07:07,00:07:12,"Yeah. So do you strap the riders in, or do they do it themselves?"
112,00:07:12,00:07:14,"Lady, it's the Tunnel of Love, not Colossus."
113,00:07:14,00:07:17,People like to get up close and personal on this ride.
114,00:07:17,00:07:20,So you keep the belts loose on purpose.
115,00:07:20,00:07:25,Loose enough for adults to get close or six-year-old kids to slide through?
116,00:08:45,00:08:47,"Officer, give us a minute."
117,00:08:51,00:08:53,You tampered with the evidence.
118,00:08:53,00:08:55,"Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about."
119,00:08:55,00:08:57,"Oh, spare me theHee Hawroutine."
120,00:08:57,00:08:59,You run this nightmare on wheels.
121,00:08:59,00:09:00,I found this in there.
122,00:09:00,00:09:06,You send one of your employees into that tunnel to fix the track where that little girl was killed to cover your ass?
123,00:09:06,00:09:10,"Glad you found that, 'cause Puppy's been missing since I rolled into Vegas."
124,00:09:11,00:09:18,"Look, I, uh... I'm sorry as the next jim-jim about what happened, ma'am but... I ain't got nothing to do with it."
125,00:09:18,00:09:20,Field test for drugs.
126,00:09:20,00:09:21,I'm sure you've done this before.
127,00:09:22,00:09:23,You can't make me take a drug test.
128,00:09:23,00:09:26,"Oh, before you came to Nevada you should've looked up the law."
129,00:09:26,00:09:30,Mandatory drug testing wherever there's been an accident.
130,00:09:30,00:09:32,"Pee now, and don't tell me you're shy."
131,00:09:42,00:09:43,Stay on him.
132,00:09:49,00:09:51,Mandatory drug testing?
133,00:09:51,00:09:52,There should be.
134,00:09:52,00:09:55,And I don't have to wait for results to know that guy's coked out of his brain.
135,00:09:55,00:09:57,Cocaine bugs?
136,00:09:57,00:09:58,Oh...
137,00:09:58,00:10:01,Crawling all under his skin.
138,00:10:01,00:10:10,"GRISSOM: Like David Crosby said, big fella: ""If I'd known I was going to live this long I'd have taken better care of my teeth."" Right you are, Mister Crime Scene Investigator."
139,00:10:10,00:10:17,"You know, most dogs have 42 teeth but, as you've discovered, your Cujo only has 41."
140,00:10:17,00:10:18,Woof-woof.
141,00:10:18,00:10:21,"Did you ever hear a dog say woof-woof, Greg?"
142,00:10:22,00:10:24,"I mean, what is the origin of that?"
143,00:10:24,00:10:26,"And what do we sound like to them, I wonder?"
144,00:10:26,00:10:27,I don't know.
145,00:10:27,00:10:29,"Probably blah, blah, blah."
146,00:10:30,00:10:33,"Did you come here with some particular blah, blah, blah for me?"
147,00:10:33,00:10:34,Yes.
148,00:10:34,00:10:37,Two words. Paw prints.
149,00:10:37,00:10:40,Your dentally-challenged killer left them all over the vic's clothes.
150,00:10:40,00:10:44,"Greg, you know that paw prints are not the same as fingerprints."
151,00:10:44,00:10:48,"True, and even if they were, we don't have the database."
152,00:10:48,00:10:51,But they can tell you the size of the dog.
153,00:10:51,00:10:52,And?
154,00:10:52,00:10:56,"And according to my sagacious calculations, this is a big dog."
155,00:10:56,00:10:58,At least 100 pounds.
156,00:10:58,00:11:02,Now if we can just figure out where he went to medical school we'll be home free.
157,00:11:02,00:11:09,"Huh? The, uh big dog is a Great Dane-Mastiff mix."
158,00:11:09,00:11:12,So my paw prints didn't even help.
159,00:11:12,00:11:14,"No, odontology did."
160,00:11:14,00:11:15,Dr. Robbins' dental mold.
161,00:11:15,00:11:19,"But, uh it's always nice to have a visit with you, Greg."
162,00:11:19,00:11:20,Thank you.
163,00:11:20,00:11:22,So now you think you're going to find this dog?
164,00:11:22,00:11:28,The array of the bite the squarish impression of the jaw are unique to a Dane or Dane mix.
165,00:11:28,00:11:32,And there are only 40 registered in the greater Las Vegas area.
166,00:11:32,00:11:37,So if one of them is owed a visit by the Tooth Fairy...
167,00:11:37,00:11:40,yes... I think I can.
168,00:11:40,00:11:41,Corn.
169,00:11:41,00:11:42,Hamburger.
170,00:11:42,00:11:43,Rawhide.
171,00:11:43,00:11:46,But no human cellular tissue in this sample.
172,00:11:46,00:11:49,Only 30 more jars to go.
173,00:11:49,00:11:50,"This is rough, man."
174,00:11:50,00:11:52,We should be pulling better cases by now.
175,00:11:52,00:11:54,"Millionaire murders, casino heists."
176,00:11:54,00:12:00,It's interesting how we categorize evidence in terms of what it means to us as opposed to what it might mean to the case.
177,00:12:00,00:12:03,"Uh, we're supposed to like scat patrol?"
178,00:12:03,00:12:08,"Sometimes we deal with bugs, worms, waste or worse."
179,00:12:08,00:12:15,But as scientists we look beyond the possibly offensive qualities of these things to what they might tell us about the puzzle we're trying to solve.
180,00:12:17,00:12:18,Yeah.
181,00:12:18,00:12:20,"Man, do you turn it on like this at your seminars?"
182,00:12:20,00:12:23,"People actually pay to go to my seminars, Nick."
183,00:12:25,00:12:26,We've I.D.'d the dog.
184,00:12:26,00:12:29,"Well, if he's got bits of jogger hanging out of his mouth, cuff him."
185,00:12:29,00:12:31,I pulled those rap sheets.
186,00:12:31,00:12:32,Called around.
187,00:12:32,00:12:33,And?
188,00:12:33,00:12:35,The one with the missing tooth is no angel.
189,00:12:35,00:12:37,He attacked a gas man checking a meter.
190,00:12:37,00:12:41,Took a chunk of thigh and severed a testicle.
191,00:12:44,00:12:45,(doorbell chimes)
192,00:12:45,00:12:47,(dog barks)
193,00:12:48,00:12:50,Can I help you?
194,00:12:50,00:12:51,Are you Susan Hillridge?
195,00:12:51,00:12:53,"Yes, Dr. Hillridge."
196,00:12:58,00:13:00,Is this your dog Doctor?
197,00:13:01,00:13:01,"Yes, Simba."
198,00:13:01,00:13:04,"Well, you have a problem."
199,00:13:04,00:13:05,"Oh, no. Not again."
200,00:13:12,00:13:14,What makes you think Simba was involved?
201,00:13:15,00:13:17,There have been complaints about your dog in the past.
202,00:13:18,00:13:19,Your meter reader's singing soprano.
203,00:13:20,00:13:21,"Oh, I get it now."
204,00:13:21,00:13:23,"You're talking about my old dog, Dickie."
205,00:13:23,00:13:24,He was aggressive.
206,00:13:24,00:13:26,That's why I put him down.
207,00:13:26,00:13:27,Simba just gets out of the yard a lot.
208,00:13:28,00:13:31,The dog we're looking for is missing a tooth.
209,00:13:31,00:13:36,I noticed that Simba is also missing a tooth.
210,00:13:36,00:13:38,"Okay, he is missing a tooth."
211,00:13:38,00:13:41,But he just gets out and wrestles with neighbors' garbage cans.
212,00:13:41,00:13:42,He's not a violent dog.
213,00:13:42,00:13:44,That may be.
214,00:13:44,00:13:49,We still have to take him into custody until we can determine whether or not he had any involvement in this homicide.
215,00:13:49,00:13:51,"Officers, go ahead. He's all yours."
216,00:13:51,00:13:54,You're making a mistake.
217,00:13:54,00:13:57,GRISSOM: You said that you were a doctor.
218,00:13:57,00:13:59,May I ask your specialty?
219,00:13:59,00:14:00,Nutrition.
220,00:14:00,00:14:02,My patients are mostly professional athletes.
221,00:14:02,00:14:06,Do you ever consult with amateur athletes?
222,00:14:06,00:14:07,Like marathoners?
223,00:14:07,00:14:09,You mean like that jogger? What was his name?
224,00:14:09,00:14:10,Terry Manning.
225,00:14:10,00:14:11,Doesn't ring a bell.
226,00:14:12,00:14:13,"And I'm very good with names, Mr. Grissom."
227,00:14:13,00:14:15,You'll let me know when I can pick up Simba.
228,00:14:15,00:14:17,You're assuming a lot.
229,00:14:17,00:14:18,So are you.
230,00:14:20,00:14:23,So you did the tox screen on my carnie?
231,00:14:23,00:14:25,Roger that.
232,00:14:25,00:14:29,"You know, I have seen guys drink, like, five gallons of water to try and dilute their urine."
233,00:14:29,00:14:31,It's the old straight flush.
234,00:14:31,00:14:34,But all Bad Boy Sanders has to do is just test the specific gravity and blammo.
235,00:14:34,00:14:36,I can still catch their toxic butts.
236,00:14:36,00:14:37,Mm-hmm.
237,00:14:37,00:14:38,So?
238,00:14:38,00:14:41,So your guy didn't do that.
239,00:14:41,00:14:42,Great.
240,00:14:43,00:14:44,What'd he do? Try and mask it?
241,00:14:44,00:14:45,No.
242,00:14:45,00:14:48,"Oh, come on, that creep tested clean?"
243,00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
244,00:14:49,00:14:51,For someone who's on the pill.
245,00:14:51,00:14:52,What?
246,00:14:52,00:14:56,He's got synthetic estrogen in his urine sample.
247,00:14:56,00:14:58,Should modulate his mood swings.
248,00:14:58,00:14:59,Oldest trick in the book.
249,00:14:59,00:15:01,Somebody else's urine.
250,00:15:01,00:15:03,Probably keeps a stash in his trailer.
251,00:15:03,00:15:06,And that Uniform was too green to look for it.
252,00:15:06,00:15:09,Isn't that in the Constitution somewhere?
253,00:15:09,00:15:11,A man's inalienable right to pee in private?
254,00:15:11,00:15:14,"Hey, I just got off the phone with OSHA."
255,00:15:14,00:15:18,Our carnival has violations in eight states.
256,00:15:18,00:15:19,What a surprise.
257,00:15:19,00:15:20,But that's not all.
258,00:15:20,00:15:22,More than half these guys have records.
259,00:15:22,00:15:24,"And Pickens, the boss?"
260,00:15:24,00:15:26,His real name is Roger Peet.
261,00:15:26,00:15:28,He's a convicted sex offender on parole.
262,00:15:28,00:15:30,Let's go.
263,00:15:32,00:15:35,How was I supposed to know she's 16 and a half?
264,00:15:35,00:15:38,From the neck down she was all grown up.
265,00:15:38,00:15:41,You know what I mean?
266,00:15:41,00:15:43,I have a teenage daughter.
267,00:15:43,00:15:46,"So, no, I don't know what you mean."
268,00:15:49,00:15:50,"Jerry Lee Lewis, man."
269,00:15:51,00:15:53,Same thing happened to him.
270,00:15:53,00:15:56,"What's all this got to do with the little dead girl, anyway?"
271,00:15:56,00:15:57,You tell us.
272,00:15:57,00:16:05,I was walking down the midway and I seen this woman come whishing out of the tunnel screaming for her daughter.
273,00:16:05,00:16:08,My baby! My baby!
274,00:16:08,00:16:09,My baby!
275,00:16:09,00:16:15,"Me and Joey, he's the Operator we hit the kill switch, stop the ride ran in the tunnel and look for the kid."
276,00:16:15,00:16:19,And I seen her laying facedown in the pool of water.
277,00:16:19,00:16:20,What did you do?
278,00:16:20,00:16:21,I didn't do nothing.
279,00:16:21,00:16:24,She was dead.
280,00:16:24,00:16:26,I didn't come within two feet of her.
281,00:16:26,00:16:28,I'm sorry about what happened.
282,00:16:28,00:16:32,But that's all that I know.
283,00:16:33,00:16:36,If you so much as breathed on this child the evidence will tell me.
284,00:16:36,00:16:45,"You can dope your urine change your name compare yourself to Elvis himself but if you harmed Sandy Dantini, I'm going to get you."
285,00:16:54,00:16:56,You worried you tipped your hand in there?
286,00:16:56,00:16:57,No.
287,00:16:57,00:17:01,"Look, don't bite my head off, but any chance you're going after this guy because you're a mother?"
288,00:17:01,00:17:05,Pickens is a drug addict and sex offender operating a two-ton kid magnet.
289,00:17:05,00:17:08,Did you take a look around that carnival?
290,00:17:08,00:17:09,Yeah.
291,00:17:09,00:17:11,Did you notice anything about those other rides?
292,00:17:11,00:17:12,Maybe.
293,00:17:12,00:17:13,Ferris wheel-- single cars in the open.
294,00:17:13,00:17:15,Zipper-- single cars in the open.
295,00:17:15,00:17:18,Himalaya-- group cars in the open.
296,00:17:18,00:17:21,How come Pickens was hanging around the only ride that takes kids into the dark?
297,00:17:24,00:17:26,What if he pulled that little girl out of the car?
298,00:17:26,00:17:29,You have anything to support that?
299,00:17:31,00:17:33,Hey.
300,00:17:33,00:17:35,We aren't going to lunch are we?
301,00:17:35,00:17:41,"Simba's mold's still damp, but you can see it's a perfect match to the bite mark on the jogger."
302,00:17:41,00:17:43,Does this mean Simba's going to the big dog pound in the sky?
303,00:17:44,00:17:46,"No, we need to build some more evidence."
304,00:17:46,00:17:48,Find some jogger in Simba's stool.
305,00:17:48,00:17:51,"Well, I can tell you we found a unique sample at the crime scene."
306,00:17:51,00:17:55,Great Dane-sized scat containing bits of premium pet store kibble.
307,00:17:55,00:17:57,How premium?
308,00:17:57,00:17:59,"Sirloin, rice, nothing artificial."
309,00:17:59,00:18:02,We need to find out what Dr. Hillridge feeds her dog.
310,00:18:03,00:18:05,Just coming to see you.
311,00:18:05,00:18:08,You remember that ice we found at the crime scene?
312,00:18:08,00:18:10,There's nothing in here.
313,00:18:10,00:18:11,It didn't melt. It evaporated.
314,00:18:11,00:18:12,Dry ice.
315,00:18:13,00:18:16,"Frozen CO2 sublimates into invisible gas, not water."
316,00:18:16,00:18:19,The jogger was missing some organs.
317,00:18:19,00:18:22,Surgical teams use dry ice to pack organs shipped for transplant.
318,00:18:22,00:18:25,It just so happens the dog's owner is a doctor.
319,00:18:25,00:18:26,Surgeon?
320,00:18:26,00:18:27,Nutritionist.
321,00:18:27,00:18:30,But all medical residents have surgical rotations.
322,00:18:30,00:18:32,"Fellas, we have a doctor's appointment."
323,00:19:35,00:19:39,Would you mind if I looked in your freezer?
324,00:19:39,00:19:45,"I have a patient coming in exactly 20 minutes so if you want to rifle around until then, fine but I will not leave my place of business."
325,00:19:45,00:19:46,No one's asked you to.
326,00:20:09,00:20:12,"You're very organized, Dr. Hillridge."
327,00:20:12,00:20:16,I imagine you're upset about your dog-- having to put him down.
328,00:20:16,00:20:18,I don't hold onto things.
329,00:20:18,00:20:21,I accept the evolution of change.
330,00:20:21,00:20:24,"We live, we die, we replenish the earth."
331,00:20:24,00:20:26,Man's best friend...
332,00:20:26,00:20:28,"but not yours, huh?"
333,00:20:28,00:20:30,None of us gets out alive.
334,00:20:30,00:20:33,I would think in your job you'd know that.
335,00:20:33,00:20:39,But if we treat our bodies like a temple we can cheat time.
336,00:20:39,00:20:41,Your eyes...
337,00:20:41,00:20:43,What?
338,00:20:43,00:20:44,The lower rims are pale.
339,00:20:44,00:20:46,You're deficient in folic acid.
340,00:20:46,00:20:48,You're not eating your beets.
341,00:20:48,00:20:50,Two beets have 541/////2% percent of the RDA.
342,00:21:01,00:21:04,May I ask you what medical school you attended?
343,00:21:04,00:21:06,Will that help with your investigation?
344,00:21:07,00:21:08,I just thought the way you handled that knife...
345,00:21:09,00:21:10,"Oh, the knife. No."
346,00:21:10,00:21:11,I was in the CIA.
347,00:21:12,00:21:16,Culinary Institute of America.
348,00:21:16,00:21:20,(blender whirring)
349,00:21:20,00:21:27,"Tell me, Mr. Grissom how does a man choose death as his profession?"
350,00:21:27,00:21:29,"It chose me, actually."
351,00:21:29,00:21:32,I guess one man's corpse is another man's candy.
352,00:21:32,00:21:33,Care for a sip?
353,00:21:33,00:21:34,It's full of folacin.
354,00:21:34,00:21:36,"No, thanks."
355,00:21:37,00:21:40,"Griss, can I show you something?"
356,00:21:42,00:21:43,Excuse me.
357,00:21:48,00:21:51,Surgery equipment.
358,00:21:51,00:22:00,"""Emory Medical Supplies, Boston, Mass, 1875."" Antiques."
359,00:22:01,00:22:03,"Boy, these are well maintained."
360,00:22:03,00:22:05,Exactly.
361,00:22:05,00:22:09,"What I find interesting is that she keeps them near the door, not in the office."
362,00:22:10,00:22:12,In case she needs to break out and go do some work.
363,00:22:13,00:22:16,Maybe she makes house calls.
364,00:22:18,00:22:19,May we help you?
365,00:22:19,00:22:21,"Yes, is Dr. Hillridge around?"
366,00:22:21,00:22:22,I'm here for a 4:00.
367,00:22:25,00:22:26,Edwin.
368,00:22:26,00:22:28,You look great today.
369,00:22:28,00:22:29,How'd the race go?
370,00:22:29,00:22:31,I finished in three hours and ten minutes.
371,00:22:31,00:22:33,You can do better.
372,00:22:44,00:22:45,She gives me the willies.
373,00:22:45,00:22:47,We can't arrest her for that.
374,00:22:47,00:22:50,"Yeah, well, maybe we can link these to the crime."
375,00:22:50,00:22:54,Her dog may have eaten that jogger but he can't harvest the organs.
376,00:22:54,00:22:58,"No question about it, the cause of death is drowning."
377,00:22:58,00:22:59,How tall was the victim?
378,00:23:00,00:23:02,"Three feet, give or take an inch."
379,00:23:02,00:23:05,The water was a foot and a half deep.
380,00:23:05,00:23:09,"She could've easily climbed out, unless she was unconscious."
381,00:23:09,00:23:11,"Maybe she had a minor concussion, or was stunned."
382,00:23:11,00:23:13,That could explain why she couldn't get out.
383,00:23:13,00:23:15,"I checked, believe me. She didn't."
384,00:23:15,00:23:19,The only injury I could find on this little girl was a fractured forearm.
385,00:23:20,00:23:21,Spiral or straight?
386,00:23:21,00:23:22,X-rays just came back.
387,00:23:22,00:23:23,Let's see.
388,00:23:32,00:23:33,Spiral.
389,00:23:33,00:23:35,That's not from a fall.
390,00:23:35,00:23:39,Somebody twisted that little girl's arm hard enough to break it.
391,00:23:40,00:23:41,Perimortem?
392,00:23:42,00:23:45,Swelling takes at least two to four minutes of active circulation.
393,00:23:45,00:23:49,"There's no swelling, so it had to happen moments before she died."
394,00:23:49,00:23:52,So someone did yank her out of that car in the dark.
395,00:23:52,00:23:54,Mommy!
396,00:23:54,00:23:57,Sandy!
397,00:23:57,00:23:59,Wait.
398,00:23:59,00:24:02,Pickens yanks her out just so he can drown her?
399,00:24:02,00:24:03,He's a sex offender.
400,00:24:03,00:24:05,He was going to take her someplace.
401,00:24:05,00:24:06,Not without someone seeing him.
402,00:24:06,00:24:08,You read the OSHA report.
403,00:24:08,00:24:10,How many emergency doors were operational?
404,00:24:10,00:24:12,None.
405,00:24:12,00:24:16,He was trapped like a rat.
406,00:24:18,00:24:23,He did the only thing he could-- he hid the evidence.
407,00:24:25,00:24:27,Drowned the little girl.
408,00:24:29,00:24:31,I'm going to go call Brass.
409,00:24:32,00:24:35,"You're going to enter this as a homicide, right?"
410,00:24:35,00:24:39,"Technically, it's somewhere between accidental and undetermined."
411,00:24:39,00:24:40,It's a homicide.
412,00:24:40,00:24:41,I'm going to get your proof.
413,00:24:41,00:24:43,So write down that accidental in pencil.
414,00:24:54,00:24:55,Can you help me?
415,00:24:55,00:24:58,I need to find out when my daughter's going to be released.
416,00:24:59,00:25:00,I'm not a coroner. What's your daughter's name?
417,00:25:00,00:25:02,Sandy Dantini.
418,00:25:02,00:25:05,"Oh, Mrs. Dantini."
419,00:25:05,00:25:07,I'm Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
420,00:25:07,00:25:10,"You've spoken with my colleague, Sara Sidle."
421,00:25:10,00:25:12,I'm so sorry.
422,00:25:14,00:25:19,Um... did you find out what happened at the carnival to my baby?
423,00:25:19,00:25:22,"Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions."
424,00:25:22,00:25:29,Is it possible that someone reached into your car and pulled out your daughter?
425,00:25:30,00:25:34,I... thought it was an accident.
426,00:25:34,00:25:38,You read all the time about how dangerous amusement parks can be.
427,00:25:38,00:25:40,You think it can never happen to you.
428,00:25:40,00:25:44,You think you can protect your kids.
429,00:25:46,00:25:52,"Well, when you went in the water to try to save Sandy did you hear anything?"
430,00:25:52,00:25:56,Did you... sense that anyone was there... in the dark?
431,00:25:59,00:26:00,I-I-I don't know.
432,00:26:00,00:26:04,"I mean, well, you know, it all happened so fast."
433,00:26:04,00:26:06,I was... focused on finding Sandy.
434,00:26:08,00:26:09,Do you...
435,00:26:09,00:26:12,do you think someone else was there?
436,00:26:14,00:26:18,I'm not ruling anything out.
437,00:26:32,00:26:33,"Look, I didn't do anything wrong."
438,00:26:33,00:26:37,"I may have recycled a few caskets but you're talking about a whole different ball game, here."
439,00:26:37,00:26:39,"Mr. Gesek, I'm not accusing you of anything."
440,00:26:39,00:26:41,I'm not even here officially.
441,00:26:41,00:26:44,Think of yourself as a consultant to the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
442,00:26:44,00:26:46,Do I get paid?
443,00:26:48,00:26:50,What do you know about organ theft?
444,00:26:50,00:26:53,"Oh, if I was in that business I wouldn't worry about getting paid."
445,00:26:53,00:26:57,You know there are places overseas that'll pay 50 grand for one lung?
446,00:26:58,00:26:59,60 for a heart?
447,00:26:59,00:27:01,And you know this because...?
448,00:27:01,00:27:02,Not firsthand.
449,00:27:02,00:27:03,Not even secondhand.
450,00:27:03,00:27:06,At the last funeral directors' convention...
451,00:27:06,00:27:07,you'd be amazed what you hear.
452,00:27:07,00:27:11,"But, you know, it takes a lot to keep a business afloat."
453,00:27:11,00:27:14,Tell me about the local market for organs.
454,00:27:15,00:27:17,"Well, we're talking about life and death."
455,00:27:17,00:27:18,It's probably pretty good.
456,00:27:18,00:27:23,If someone was disemboweled and their liver taken what would that go for?
457,00:27:23,00:27:24,"Menu, everything a la carte."
458,00:27:25,00:27:26,"Corneas, $5,000."
459,00:27:26,00:27:27,"Kidney, $20,000."
460,00:27:27,00:27:28,"Liver, 40."
461,00:27:28,00:27:29,"Bowel, 30."
462,00:27:29,00:27:30,"Pancreas, 18."
463,00:27:33,00:27:36,It's amazing what you can learn at a convention.
464,00:27:37,00:27:38,Warrick.
465,00:27:38,00:27:39,I got a match.
466,00:27:39,00:27:40,Cool. Yeah.
467,00:27:40,00:27:42,You want to hand me those filter papers right there?
468,00:27:42,00:27:47,"The scat I found at the crime scene and the scat from the doctor's house were the same, except for one difference."
469,00:27:47,00:27:51,The stuff from the backyard-- full of human cellular tissue.
470,00:27:51,00:27:53,Jogger DNA.
471,00:27:53,00:27:54,So we got the right dog.
472,00:27:56,00:28:00,"Well, let's see if the owner cut the vic up."
473,00:28:01,00:28:02,Reactive agents.
474,00:28:03,00:28:05,One part leuko-malachite.
475,00:28:05,00:28:08,One part hydrogen peroxide-- used by blondes everywhere.
476,00:28:15,00:28:16,Blue.
477,00:28:16,00:28:17,"Weird, isn't it?"
478,00:28:17,00:28:18,What's that?
479,00:28:18,00:28:21,To prove the presence of heme the stuff that makes blood red...
480,00:28:21,00:28:22,Turns the swab blue.
481,00:28:22,00:28:24,Yeah.
482,00:28:24,00:28:27,I own this attraction and it's going with me to the next town.
483,00:28:27,00:28:29,It's evidence.
484,00:28:29,00:28:30,It's not going anywhere. Nothing is.
485,00:28:31,00:28:32,"What, says you two string beans?"
486,00:28:32,00:28:36,It's going to take a lot more than vegetable insults to get us to move.
487,00:28:36,00:28:37,"Lady, you don't know who you're messing with."
488,00:28:37,00:28:41,"Oh, I know exactly who you are, Mr. Pickens."
489,00:28:41,00:28:48,"And if you so much as look at me in the wrong way, I will personally lock you in a cell with someone who's going to do the same thing to you that you've been doing to those little girls."
490,00:28:48,00:28:49,"BRASS: Whoa, whoa, whoa."
491,00:28:49,00:28:51,"What, you start the party without me?"
492,00:28:51,00:28:53,That could get dangerous.
493,00:28:55,00:28:56,Thomas Pickens?
494,00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
495,00:28:58,00:28:58,I got a court order.
496,00:28:59,00:29:01,This ride stays in Vegas and you're coming with me.
497,00:29:01,00:29:03,You pullin' my pud?
498,00:29:03,00:29:05,"You know, the thought never crossed my mind."
499,00:29:05,00:29:06,Come on.
500,00:29:11,00:29:12,What?
501,00:29:13,00:29:15,Nothing.
502,00:29:15,00:29:17,This is fun.
503,00:29:17,00:29:18,As compared to what?
504,00:29:19,00:29:21,As compared to a more scientific approach.
505,00:29:23,00:29:24,"I'm sorry, guys."
506,00:29:24,00:29:26,If she cut up that jogger she didn't use that scalpel.
507,00:29:26,00:29:29,But we found evidence of blood on it.
508,00:29:29,00:29:32,I had Sanders run a degradation on that same sample.
509,00:29:32,00:29:34,The blood is 50 to 200 years old.
510,00:29:34,00:29:39,"Antique, like the scalpel ruling out the possibility it was used in the murder of our jogger."
511,00:29:39,00:29:41,(phone ringing)
512,00:29:41,00:29:42,Yeah.
513,00:29:44,00:29:45,I'll be right out.
514,00:29:48,00:29:49,I have a visitor.
515,00:30:00,00:30:01,Hi.
516,00:30:01,00:30:02,I have folic acid.
517,00:30:02,00:30:04,I was worried about your eyes.
518,00:30:04,00:30:09,"I assume my surgical instruments came back clean, or relatively clean."
519,00:30:10,00:30:15,Are you here for a nutritional consultation or to eavesdrop on my investigation?
520,00:30:15,00:30:20,"Actually, my house felt a little crowded-- all those men you sent."
521,00:30:22,00:30:25,"The, uh, police sent them."
522,00:30:25,00:30:26,But you dictated the scope of the warrant.
523,00:30:26,00:30:28,They're taking everything from my kitchen and office.
524,00:30:29,00:30:33,You have three prior complaints in three separate states for owning vicious dogs.
525,00:30:33,00:30:35,And?
526,00:30:35,00:30:37,What else do you know about me?
527,00:30:37,00:30:40,Each complaint is from a mountain state.
528,00:30:40,00:30:42,Is it a crime to like the mountains?
529,00:30:42,00:30:43,No.
530,00:30:43,00:30:47,Only if we find other joggers have turned up dead.
531,00:30:49,00:30:51,"What's a liver go for these days, Doc?"
532,00:30:51,00:30:53,What?
533,00:30:53,00:30:57,Terry Manning was missing several key organs-- healthy organs.
534,00:30:57,00:30:58,You disappoint me.
535,00:30:58,00:31:01,I thought you were smarter than that.
536,00:31:01,00:31:05,Coenzyme Q-10 could help with mental acuity.
537,00:31:11,00:31:16,"""The last act is bloody however fine the rest of the play."" Pascal."
538,00:31:16,00:31:19,Very impressive.
539,00:31:19,00:31:22,"I prefer Buddha, though."
540,00:31:22,00:31:28,"""Even death is not to be feared by those who lived wisely."" One request."
541,00:31:28,00:31:30,Ask them not to leave my house a mess.
542,00:31:30,00:31:32,You know how I like order.
543,00:31:50,00:31:52,"What, are you guys working in bulk now?"
544,00:31:52,00:31:54,"Hey, you're the one who said that lady doc keeps skipping town."
545,00:31:54,00:31:58,"If the jogger's blood is in any of this stuff, we need to find it now."
546,00:31:58,00:32:02,This is only part of the kitchen-- the rest is in those bags and boxes.
547,00:32:02,00:32:03,"I'm ready, Nick."
548,00:32:03,00:32:04,You want to hit the lights?
549,00:32:32,00:32:38,She made a protein shake in this yesterday right in front of me.
550,00:32:38,00:32:41,Why would she do that?
551,00:32:41,00:32:45,Get this to DNA-- see if this is the jogger's blood.
552,00:32:45,00:32:48,I'd place a bet on it.
553,00:32:51,00:32:52,"Whoa, whoa."
554,00:32:52,00:32:57,So she's not selling the organs on the black market... she's eating them?
555,00:32:59,00:33:01,Possibly drinking them.
556,00:33:18,00:33:20,I want four techs in there placed four feet apart.
557,00:33:20,00:33:23,Let's try to pull the girl out from every conceivable angle.
558,00:33:23,00:33:30,"Okay, based on our theory a loose seat belt enabled Pickens to yank the little girl out of her seat."
559,00:33:33,00:33:35,Mom was on the left.
560,00:33:37,00:33:39,42 pounds?
561,00:33:41,00:33:43,Just like little Sandy.
562,00:33:44,00:33:46,"And, just like..."
563,00:33:46,00:33:50,the loose seat belt.
564,00:34:28,00:34:31,The belt wasn't loose enough to yank the girl out.
565,00:34:33,00:34:35,Forget Pickens.
566,00:34:35,00:34:40,"The only person who could've done it, then is the person that was in the car with her-- the mother."
567,00:34:40,00:34:43,Her eyes were pointing in the wrong direction.
568,00:34:43,00:34:45,"I'm sorry, what?"
569,00:34:46,00:34:50,Carla Dantini was looking left when she told me about the accident.
570,00:34:53,00:34:59,"When a person is remembering, they look right and when they're creating, they look left."
571,00:34:59,00:35:02,"And by creating, you mean fabricating."
572,00:35:02,00:35:06,Neurolinguistics programming human behavioral science.
573,00:35:07,00:35:10,Call Brass and tell him to meet us at the mother's house.
574,00:35:20,00:35:21,Mr. Grissom.
575,00:35:21,00:35:24,You're looking grim.
576,00:35:24,00:35:26,I'm afraid I don't have a supplement for that.
577,00:35:26,00:35:30,We found blood in your kitchen blender.
578,00:35:30,00:35:33,The lab has matched it to the dead jogger.
579,00:35:34,00:35:37,It had to happen eventually.
580,00:35:37,00:35:38,Why?
581,00:35:38,00:35:39,You're the scientist.
582,00:35:39,00:35:42,I should have thought you'd figured that out.
583,00:35:42,00:35:45,I haven't.
584,00:35:45,00:35:47,"Think of the bugs, Grissom."
585,00:35:47,00:35:49,Cycle of life?
586,00:35:49,00:35:51,Angels versus insects?
587,00:35:51,00:35:58,When we die the fable we tell ourselves is we go toward a white light and angels.
588,00:35:58,00:36:05,But you and I both know the hard reality is that insects arrive immediately and begin turning us back to earth.
589,00:36:05,00:36:07,Yes.
590,00:36:07,00:36:09,But the insects haven't killed anyone.
591,00:36:09,00:36:11,No.
592,00:36:11,00:36:15,But they'd die if they didn't have bodies to feed off of.
593,00:36:15,00:36:16,And so will I.
594,00:36:18,00:36:20,Porphyria.
595,00:36:20,00:36:24,The madness of King George.
596,00:36:24,00:36:26,Or the legend of the vampire.
597,00:36:26,00:36:29,Which makes it a real hard disease to have.
598,00:36:31,00:36:32,But it's real for me.
599,00:36:32,00:36:34,It's genetic.
600,00:36:34,00:36:37,The only thing my father ever gave me.
601,00:36:40,00:36:45,The first time it presented was after a minor sunburn.
602,00:36:45,00:36:48,"My lips receded, so did my gums."
603,00:36:48,00:36:51,I increased my glucose intake and I was fine...
604,00:36:52,00:36:53,for a while.
605,00:36:53,00:36:56,I began a drug regimen.
606,00:36:56,00:36:58,But they only treated the symptoms.
607,00:36:58,00:37:01,I had my spleen removed because it absorbed my blood.
608,00:37:02,00:37:04,But nothing helped.
609,00:37:04,00:37:07,Lesions started forming on my face.
610,00:37:07,00:37:10,That's when I bought my first dog.
611,00:37:10,00:37:13,Bullets and poison leave residue in the blood.
612,00:37:13,00:37:16,Dogs kill clean.
613,00:37:16,00:37:19,Imagine what I'd look like by now without them.
614,00:37:27,00:37:30,You could've tried intravenous hematin.
615,00:37:30,00:37:33,Human blood is the richest source of heme.
616,00:37:33,00:37:38,"And so you extracted the organs with the most blood-- the liver, the spleen, the heart."
617,00:37:38,00:37:42,"If you lock me up, I'll go mad."
618,00:37:42,00:37:45,"Unfortunately, a symptom of your condition."
619,00:37:45,00:37:47,"But you've been killing people, Doctor."
620,00:37:47,00:37:49,I'll die in prison.
621,00:37:49,00:37:53,"Yes, but the people you'd be feeding off of will still be alive."
622,00:37:55,00:37:56,Cycle of life.
623,00:37:58,00:38:00,Sergeant.
624,00:38:06,00:38:10,You're under arrest for the murder of Terry Manning.
625,00:38:14,00:38:16,You have one more question.
626,00:38:16,00:38:19,How could I consume raw organs?
627,00:38:19,00:38:22,"Not morally, aesthetically."
628,00:38:24,00:38:27,I dried them and ground them into powder.
629,00:38:30,00:38:31,Protein powder.
630,00:38:31,00:38:37,You want an empirical experience?
631,00:38:37,00:38:39,There's a fresh shake in my fridge.
632,00:38:39,00:38:42,Let's go.
633,00:38:49,00:38:50,Officer.
634,00:38:54,00:38:56,"She is nuts, right?"
635,00:38:59,00:39:02,She's a cold-blooded killer.
636,00:39:04,00:39:05,"You got the warrant, right?"
637,00:39:05,00:39:07,"Yeah, but it's limited in scope."
638,00:39:07,00:39:11,The boyfriend's an attorney so we can't toss the place.
639,00:39:11,00:39:12,Mrs. Dantini.
640,00:39:12,00:39:15,You have news about Sandy?
641,00:39:15,00:39:17,We may have a lead.
642,00:39:17,00:39:20,We need to see the clothes that you wore the day that your daughter died.
643,00:39:21,00:39:21,Why?
644,00:39:22,00:39:22,"It's okay, honey."
645,00:39:23,00:39:24,"I'm Hugh Young, Mrs. Dantini's attorney."
646,00:39:24,00:39:25,Carla's grieving. We both are.
647,00:39:25,00:39:27,Can't this wait till after the funeral?
648,00:39:27,00:39:29,"No, it can't."
649,00:39:31,00:39:32,Where's your bedroom?
650,00:39:34,00:39:37,WILLOWS: So this is everything that you wore at the carnival last night?
651,00:39:37,00:39:39,Yes.
652,00:39:42,00:39:43,Your watch is waterlogged.
653,00:39:48,00:39:52,Yes. I went into the water after my daughter.
654,00:39:52,00:39:53,"So, you jumped in the water."
655,00:39:53,00:39:55,Yes.
656,00:39:59,00:40:02,How come your shoes are dry?
657,00:40:02,00:40:04,Well... it was yesterday.
658,00:40:04,00:40:06,Of course they're dry.
659,00:40:06,00:40:09,The lining's blue.
660,00:40:09,00:40:14,If they'd gotten wet the indigo dye would have bled onto your white socks.
661,00:40:14,00:40:16,You never went in the water.
662,00:40:16,00:40:19,WILLOWS: If you didn't go into the water how did your watch get wet?
663,00:40:19,00:40:23,Like I told her reaching for my daughter.
664,00:40:23,00:40:26,You reached for her all right.
665,00:40:35,00:40:36,My baby!
666,00:40:40,00:40:45,And when she managed to grab onto you you broke her arm.
667,00:40:46,00:40:51,And you held her under while you sat in that car until you drowned her.
668,00:40:51,00:40:56,YOUNG: Carla is any of this true?
669,00:40:59,00:41:00,I want you to leave.
670,00:41:03,00:41:06,You took your daughter to the carnival 'cause kids get hurt there all the time.
671,00:41:06,00:41:08,You thought the blame would leave town with the ride.
672,00:41:08,00:41:10,"Well, you should have planned better."
673,00:41:10,00:41:11,What did you actually think?
674,00:41:11,00:41:14,That you and your boyfriend would run off like newlyweds?
675,00:41:14,00:41:16,"No kid, no cares?"
676,00:41:16,00:41:17,I never thought anything like that.
677,00:41:18,00:41:19,She did.
678,00:41:19,00:41:21,Didn't you?
679,00:41:27,00:41:29,I'm going to need a new lawyer.
680,00:41:36,00:41:38,"Bag the evidence. Arrest her, Jim."
681,00:41:40,00:41:43,Hey...
682,00:41:43,00:41:45,you all right?
683,00:41:45,00:41:47,Yeah.
684,00:41:47,00:41:50,Since we skipped lunch you want to get something to eat?
685,00:41:50,00:41:51,Walk it off?
686,00:41:51,00:41:54,I got to go home.
687,00:41:55,00:41:57,Thanks. Rain check?
688,00:41:57,00:41:58,Mm-hmm.
689,00:42:19,00:42:21,(sighs)
690,00:42:37,00:42:39,You got my call.
691,00:42:39,00:42:43,It couldn't have come at a better time.
