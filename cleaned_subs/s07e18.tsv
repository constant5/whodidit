0	00:00:10	00:00:12	I was channeling my nerves in a positive way.
1	00:00:12	00:00:14	Somebody's got to hold it together.
2	00:00:16	00:00:19	I swear, Janice can't dance a straight line.
3	00:00:19	00:00:20	Pigeon-toed.
4	00:00:20	00:00:22	Should have stayed on the bluebell line. B.G.
5	00:00:22	00:00:25	Well, you know how she scored that principal role, right?
6	00:00:25	00:00:29	Bad on her feet, good on her back.
7	00:00:29	00:00:31	Oh, Libby, can you believe this?
8	00:00:31	00:00:32	I am so sick of this pigsty.
9	00:00:33	00:00:36	Been like this ever since Lauren got her creepy new boyfriend.
10	00:00:36	00:00:40	He's a musician. My mom dated a musician-- total freeloaders.
11	00:00:40	00:00:43	If I get bumped to principal this week, I am so out of here.
12	00:00:43	00:00:46	Take me with you.
13	00:00:46	00:00:47	Becca fell off the wagon again.
14	00:00:47	00:00:49	The nicotine dancer diet.
15	00:01:27	00:01:29	Hey! You've reached Showgirl Heaven.
16	00:01:29	00:01:31	Please leave a message at the tone. Thanks. Bye.
17	00:01:31	00:01:34	Cammie, great audition today.
18	00:01:34	00:01:36	You made it, girl.
19	00:01:36	00:01:38	You're principal. Call me for the details.
20	00:01:38	00:01:40	Congrats! (machine beeps, disconnects)
21	00:01:58	00:02:00	Everyone's in my room. Follow the music.
22	00:02:00	00:02:02	Be right there.
23	00:02:02	00:02:04	Hey, guys.
24	00:02:07	00:02:08	Libby?
25	00:02:11	00:02:12	Libby!
26	00:02:21	00:02:23	Hell of a way to spend your night off.
27	00:02:23	00:02:25	How many bodies do you have in there?
28	00:02:25	00:02:27	Three.
29	00:02:27	00:02:31	Grissom's down the hall, first door on your right. Just follow the blood.
30	00:02:51	00:02:53	My date got canceled.
31	00:02:53	00:02:55	I'm sure he had a good excuse.
32	00:03:02	00:03:04	Looks like sexual assault.
33	00:03:04	00:03:06	Bound, pants pulled down.
34	00:03:06	00:03:07	Yeah.
35	00:03:07	00:03:08	Where do you want me?
36	00:03:08	00:03:11	Next bedroom. There's another body in there.
37	00:03:11	00:03:13	Well, that makes five.
38	00:03:13	00:03:15	The dispatch said there were six.
39	00:03:15	00:03:19	According to Brass, the boyfriend of one of the victims found the bodies.
40	00:03:19	00:03:22	Said there were six roommates, all showgirls.
41	00:03:22	00:03:24	Evidently, one didn't come home.
42	00:03:24	00:03:26	She picked the right night.
43	00:04:01	00:04:03	Hot scene! Suspect under the bed!
44	00:04:03	00:04:05	Sara!
45	00:04:05	00:04:08	Please... please help me.
46	00:04:08	00:04:09	Please.
47	00:04:09	00:04:10	Hold on.
48	00:04:10	00:04:13	Victim down! Call an ambulance!
49	00:04:13	00:04:16	Dispatch, this is CSI Grissom... You're safe now, okay?
50	00:04:16	00:04:18	You're safe now. It's going to be okay.
51	00:04:18	00:04:21	Help me. Help me.
52	00:05:02	00:05:07	Up until a few hours ago, this was considered one of the safest neighborhoods in Las Vegas.
53	00:05:07	00:05:11	But with the discovery of six young women brutally slain in their beds...
54	00:05:11	00:05:13	45.
55	00:05:13	00:05:15	I've been dating Becca about a month.
56	00:05:15	00:05:20	When I saw all that blood on the stairs, I just... I just knew.
57	00:05:20	00:05:22	Jonathan, do you have a key to the house?
58	00:05:22	00:05:23	Becca gave it to me.
59	00:05:23	00:05:32	I usually try to come over and say good night, but I was... I was late. Had a couple clients in town.
60	00:05:32	00:05:34	But I didn't need the key.
61	00:05:34	00:05:36	Front door was open.
62	00:05:36	00:05:41	If we brought you some photos, would you be able to ID the girls for us?
63	00:05:53	00:05:57	Look, I know this is tough, but did she give you anything?
64	00:05:57	00:06:00	She told me her name.
65	00:06:00	00:06:04	When I went into the room, she thought that I was him.
66	00:06:04	00:06:06	Anything else?
67	00:06:06	00:06:10	It didn't make any sense.
68	00:06:10	00:06:12	Can you tell me your name?
69	00:06:12	00:06:15	Ca... Cam... Cammie.
70	00:06:15	00:06:18	Cammie, I'm Sara.
71	00:06:18	00:06:20	Who did this to you, Cammie?
72	00:06:20	00:06:23	Mm-an.... mm-an.
73	00:06:23	00:06:25	The man, what did he look like?
74	00:06:25	00:06:26	Poor w...
75	00:06:26	00:06:28	Poor wine...
76	00:06:28	00:06:31	Breast...
77	00:06:31	00:06:33	Breast... knife...
78	00:06:33	00:06:35	He-he stabbed you in the chest? (grunts)
79	00:06:35	00:06:37	No.
80	00:06:37	00:06:38	I need some help here!
81	00:06:38	00:06:42	Bye... Fin... (gasps)
82	00:06:42	00:06:43	No, no. No.
83	00:06:51	00:06:54	Looks like he was about a size 11.
84	00:06:55	00:06:58	You been up there yet?
85	00:07:06	00:07:09	I've been through all the bedrooms. She's the last.
86	00:07:09	00:07:13	Rebecca Mayford. Boyfriend ID'd her.
87	00:07:13	00:07:15	Neck's clean.
88	00:07:15	00:07:17	The other five victims' throats were transected.
89	00:07:17	00:07:23	There are at least a dozen stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.
90	00:07:23	00:07:26	Yeah. He took his time with her.
91	00:07:26	00:07:29	The others were killed efficiently.
92	00:07:29	00:07:31	Liver temp is 95.6.
93	00:07:31	00:07:36	Been dead at least two hours, which is consistent with four of the five other victims.
94	00:07:37	00:07:40	David, don't move any of the bodies just yet, okay?
95	00:07:40	00:07:42	You got it.
96	00:07:43	00:07:46	Hey.
97	00:07:47	00:07:49	What did you find?
98	00:07:49	00:07:50	Partial footprint.
99	00:07:50	00:07:56	Whoever kicked in this window was barefoot.
100	00:07:58	00:08:00	She's wearing socks.
101	00:08:00	00:08:02	Yeah, but some of the others weren't.
102	00:08:02	00:08:04	Means one of them must have been in here at some point.
103	00:08:05	00:08:08	I don't think this was her room.
104	00:08:10	00:08:12	What else?
105	00:08:13	00:08:16	Looks like the bindings were cut from the sheets.
106	00:08:17	00:08:21	It takes at least a few minutes to cut up a sheet.
107	00:08:21	00:08:24	I think when he came to this house, he was unprepared.
108	00:08:24	00:08:27	He had to use things that were already here.
109	00:08:28	00:08:34	They say a disorganized killer is apt to obtain his victims by chance.
110	00:08:34	00:08:37	Luck of the draw.
111	00:08:47	00:08:50	Busy night.
112	00:09:00	00:09:02	She looks so familiar.
113	00:09:02	00:09:07	When I first started doing this, everybody I worked on reminded me of someone.
114	00:09:10	00:09:12	Somehow, we all get past it.
115	00:09:12	00:09:15	I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
116	00:09:16	00:09:19	I'll start with the bathroom.
117	00:10:12	00:10:16	The girl in this picture is the victim from my room.
118	00:10:16	00:10:20	Becca, I'm so crazy about you.
119	00:10:20	00:10:23	I just wanted to tell you happy three-week anniversary!
120	00:10:24	00:10:26	You're awesome! And I love you bear-y much.
121	00:10:27	00:10:30	Sounds like Becca was still a kid.
122	00:10:32	00:10:37	Yeah. Well, not when she was onstage.
123	00:10:37	00:10:43	So, Grissom, I found beige carpet fibers on all three victims.
124	00:10:43	00:10:44	It's consistent with the hallway carpet.
125	00:10:45	00:10:47	I've also found rug burns on their knees.
126	00:11:02	00:11:10	Killer herded them all into here, he used the sheets from that bed to tie them up, then dragged them all down the hallway to the other two bedrooms to kill them.
127	00:11:17	00:11:19	What about Becca?
128	00:11:19	00:11:22	Why wasn't she dragged somewhere else?
129	00:11:22	00:11:23	Maybe he wanted to get her alone.
130	00:11:23	00:11:24	Maybe she excited him...
131	00:11:24	00:11:26	or pissed him off.
132	00:11:26	00:11:27	Either way, he was brutal with her.
133	00:11:28	00:11:29	She was the messiest kill.
134	00:11:29	00:11:31	He had a gun.
135	00:11:31	00:11:34	I found grip and slide impressions in some powder on the bathroom counter.
136	00:11:34	00:11:36	Well, a gun is one good way for crowd control.
137	00:11:36	00:11:38	Why didn't he just shoot them?
138	00:11:38	00:11:40	Noise factor?
139	00:11:40	00:11:42	You can't scream once your throat's been slit.
140	00:11:42	00:11:44	Yeah.
141	00:11:44	00:11:48	He had all the time he needed 'cause the neighbors couldn't hear a thing.
142	00:13:07	00:13:10	He used a chair to jam this door.
143	00:13:10	00:13:11	I heard about what happened.
144	00:13:11	00:13:12	You okay?
145	00:13:12	00:13:14	I'm fine.
146	00:13:15	00:13:19	There's a custom-made label on a wine bottle over there.
147	00:13:27	00:13:30	Love, Lewis.
148	00:13:30	00:13:32	Who did this to you, Cammie?
149	00:13:32	00:13:35	Mm-an.... mm-an.
150	00:13:35	00:13:37	The man, what did he look like?
151	00:13:39	00:13:40	Poor w...
152	00:13:40	00:13:42	Poor wine.
153	00:13:42	00:13:45	Cammie said something.
154	00:13:45	00:13:48	Poor wine.
155	00:13:48	00:13:50	Maybe it had something to do with this bottle.
156	00:13:53	00:13:54	Poor wine.
157	00:13:55	00:13:56	Maybe he forced wine down her throat.
158	00:13:56	00:13:57	Tox will tell us.
159	00:14:02	00:14:06	It was good that you were there for her, Sara.
160	00:14:07	00:14:09	She didn't have to die alone.
161	00:14:09	00:14:12	We usually show up too late to meet the victim.
162	00:14:18	00:14:23	Police have confirmed there are a total of six victims in the Green Valley showgirl murders.
163	00:14:23	00:14:29	The names have not yet been released pending individual identification and notification of their families.
164	00:14:29	00:14:32	According to police sources, there are no suspects at this time.
165	00:14:32	00:14:42	LVPD has asked anyone with any information 702-555-0132.
166	00:14:42	00:14:44	Again, that number...
167	00:16:17	00:16:21	All six victims had ligature marks on their ankles and wrists.
168	00:16:21	00:16:24	Jenn Smith was the only one with rib fractures.
169	00:16:24	00:16:25	She took some abuse.
170	00:16:25	00:16:32	Except for Becca Mayford, COD was exsanguination through incised wounds to the neck with a sharp-edged instrument.
171	00:16:32	00:16:34	How did Cammie Brookston survive until we got there?
172	00:16:34	00:16:38	Well, in her case, there was only a partial transection of the jugular.
173	00:16:38	00:16:41	Shallower cut, slower bleed.
174	00:16:41	00:16:45	I found her at least two hours after the attacks.
175	00:16:45	00:16:47	She must've applied pressure to her wound.
176	00:16:47	00:16:49	That would've bought her some time.
177	00:16:49	00:16:52	So if we'd have found her sooner, she would still be alive.
178	00:16:52	00:16:56	Sara, there's nothing you could've done.
179	00:16:56	00:16:59	Well, she has a C-section uterine scar.
180	00:16:59	00:17:00	Hairline, almost invisible.
181	00:17:00	00:17:03	She has a child.
182	00:17:03	00:17:05	Well, she gave birth some time ago.
183	00:17:05	00:17:07	Any signs of sexual assault?
184	00:17:07	00:17:09	Not with Cammie.
185	00:17:09	00:17:14	I found semen in the vaginas of Emily Wilson and Lauren Walderson.
186	00:17:14	00:17:17	Both had mild reddening and some superficial abrasion at the vaginal introitus.
187	00:17:17	00:17:22	They could have had consensual sex in the hours prior to the attack.
188	00:17:22	00:17:24	This young lady was raped.
189	00:17:24	00:17:29	00.
190	00:17:29	00:17:35	00 to 8 Any semen? No.
191	00:17:35	00:17:37	But, uh, look at these puncture wounds.
192	00:17:37	00:17:41	Stab wounds have a large cutting component to the margins.
193	00:17:41	00:17:48	Several of these stabs have additional tracks through the organ suggesting a partial withdrawal and re-thrust of the blade.
194	00:17:48	00:17:51	Is that everything then?
195	00:17:51	00:17:55	Not quite. He left something behind.
196	00:17:55	00:17:57	The tip of the knife.
197	00:18:02	00:18:07	Yes, sir, I understand that, but, uh, we're still analyzing the evidence.
198	00:18:07	00:18:11	As soon as we have something to report, we'll report it.
199	00:18:11	00:18:14	Okay.
200	00:18:14	00:18:17	I may have something for you to feed to the monster.
201	00:18:17	00:18:20	An attack order based on the blood evidence.
202	00:18:20	00:18:23	In the bathroom trash, I found six bloody paper towels.
203	00:18:24	00:18:25	Wendy ran the DNA.
204	00:18:25	00:18:28	Each towel has blood from only one victim.
205	00:18:28	00:18:31	Bottom of the pile-- first victim, top of the pile-- last.
206	00:18:31	00:18:35	And the pattern on each is consistent with the knife being wiped off.
207	00:18:35	00:18:40	I think that the killer cleaned off the knife after each kill.
208	00:18:40	00:18:43	First was Emily...
209	00:18:43	00:18:46	then Lauren...
210	00:18:46	00:18:50	Both found in Warrick's bedroom.
211	00:18:50	00:18:52	Libby was next.
212	00:18:52	00:18:55	She was found dead in Sara's bedroom.
213	00:18:55	00:18:58	Then Cammie was attacked, followed by Jennifer.
214	00:18:59	00:19:01	She was found on the floor in Warrick's bedroom.
215	00:19:01	00:19:04	There's no logic to any of this.
216	00:19:04	00:19:06	But you were right, Becca was attacked last.
217	00:19:06	00:19:10	It was all of her blood that was tracked throughout the house.
218	00:19:10	00:19:17	He stepped in her blood, walks into the bathroom to clean off the knife, back out into the hallway down the stairs.
219	00:19:17	00:19:21	But why would he clean off the knife between victims?
220	00:19:21	00:19:23	To maintain control.
221	00:19:23	00:19:26	I see a clean knife, I think that the others are still alive and...
222	00:19:26	00:19:29	I'm more compliant.
223	00:19:29	00:19:31	This is Sara Sidle.
224	00:19:31	00:19:32	Leave a message after the tone. (beeps)
225	00:19:32	00:19:39	Sara, the knife tip Doc Robbins extracted from Becca Mayford isn't metal, it's ceramic...
226	00:19:39	00:19:41	and extremely sharp.
227	00:19:41	00:19:43	I accept your thank you in advance and you're welcome.
228	00:20:11	00:20:13	Hello?
229	00:20:14	00:20:17	Uh, no, ma'am, Libby's not here.
230	00:20:17	00:20:19	My name is David Hodges.
231	00:20:19	00:20:24	I work for the Las Vegas crime lab.
232	00:20:24	00:20:25	Well, ma'am, uh...
233	00:20:25	00:20:28	I can't really say...
234	00:20:28	00:20:31	but I can give you the number of someone who can.
235	00:20:35	00:20:39	Did your daughter Libby wear a heart-shaped necklace?
236	00:20:46	00:20:49	Y-Y-Yes, yeah, I-I'm still here.
237	00:20:49	00:20:51	Uh, ma'am...
238	00:20:51	00:20:55	I don't know quite how to say this, but, um...
239	00:20:55	00:20:59	I'm afraid I have some bad news.
240	00:20:59	00:21:04	I matched Jenn Smith's footprints with a partial Grissom lifted from that broken window.
241	00:21:04	00:21:08	According to Catherine's attack order, Cammie was stabbed first and then Jenn.
242	00:21:08	00:21:10	He didn't get sloppy with Cammie, he got distracted.
243	00:21:10	00:21:13	So he was with Cammie when Jenn tried to escape.
244	00:21:25	00:21:27	Which explains Jenn's fractures.
245	00:21:27	00:21:29	He kicked the crap out of her.
246	00:21:29	00:21:33	He must have gone to the bathroom, cleaned off the knife, then dragged Jenn down the hallway to kill her.
247	00:21:34	00:21:35	He never went back to check on Cammie.
248	00:21:35	00:21:38	Six girls, one lock.
249	00:21:38	00:21:40	I ran the names of all the victims.
250	00:21:41	00:21:42	This article's the only common link.
251	00:21:42	00:21:46	They pooled their money and lived the dream in style.
252	00:21:46	00:21:48	This could definitely bait a killer.
253	00:21:48	00:21:50	The only thing missing from this is their address.
254	00:21:50	00:21:52	It says Green Valley, it's got a photo of the house.
255	00:21:52	00:21:54	If you looked hard enough, you could find it.
256	00:21:54	00:21:57	Lewis Greyburg wrote the article.
257	00:21:57	00:22:02	Lewis is the name on a custom wine label that we found at the crime scene.
258	00:22:02	00:22:03	Do me a favor.
259	00:22:03	00:22:05	Could you zoom in on that photo?
260	00:22:08	00:22:11	Oh, my God.
261	00:22:12	00:22:14	I knew I recognized her.
262	00:22:14	00:22:16	Emily Wilson.
263	00:22:18	00:22:20	Figures you'd know a showgirl.
264	00:22:20	00:22:22	Take it you've seen her dance, then, huh?
265	00:22:22	00:22:26	No, last time I saw her, she was still wearing braces.
266	00:22:50	00:22:52	Warrick Brown.
267	00:22:52	00:23:02	I remember you standing on my steps with those guilty green eyes, afraid to come in because you knew your grandma would size you up no matter what kind of trouble you got into.
268	00:23:02	00:23:04	I don't remember any trouble.
269	00:23:04	00:23:09	Like when you were 13 years old and you took her new Buick out for a spin.
270	00:23:09	00:23:11	Oh, and I banged the bumper trying to parallel park.
271	00:23:11	00:23:12	I forgot about that one.
272	00:23:12	00:23:13	Mm-hmm.
273	00:23:13	00:23:17	I haven't seen you since your grandma passed.
274	00:23:17	00:23:20	Yeah, the old neighborhood reminds me how much I miss her.
275	00:23:20	00:23:21	So why you here?
276	00:23:21	00:23:22	I came to see you.
277	00:23:22	00:23:24	Oh.
278	00:23:24	00:23:27	Let me take that for you.
279	00:23:27	00:23:29	New family painted right over my history.
280	00:23:29	00:23:31	That's 'cause they're making their own history.
281	00:23:35	00:23:40	You know, my daughter Chelsea died last August.
282	00:23:40	00:23:41	Oh, God.
283	00:23:41	00:23:43	Mm-hmm. Lung cancer.
284	00:23:43	00:23:47	She never smoked a day in her life, but her sorry husband did.
285	00:23:47	00:23:50	He's healthy as an ox.
286	00:23:50	00:23:51	Mrs. Wilson...
287	00:23:51	00:23:53	You were always interrupting your grandma.
288	00:23:53	00:23:55	but-but she liked that.
289	00:23:55	00:23:58	That's because you were thinking, she said.
290	00:23:58	00:23:59	Oh, she was proud of you.
291	00:23:59	00:24:02	You remember my little granddaughter, Emily.
292	00:24:02	00:24:08	The next time you drive up the Strip, you, you going to see her little buns in lights 'cause she's a dancer now.
293	00:24:08	00:24:11	Uh-huh.
294	00:24:11	00:24:12	Um...
295	00:24:12	00:24:14	What, what, what, what?
296	00:24:14	00:24:16	I'm working this case.
297	00:24:18	00:24:20	Those six showgirls...
298	00:24:20	00:24:22	The ones in the news?
299	00:24:22	00:24:26	Emily listed you as the next of kin.
300	00:24:28	00:24:29	No.
301	00:24:29	00:24:32	No.
302	00:24:32	00:24:35	Oh, oh, please, God...
303	00:24:35	00:24:37	No!
304	00:24:39	00:24:41	I'm so sorry.
305	00:24:41	00:24:43	I'm sorry.
306	00:24:43	00:24:45	Oh...
307	00:24:45	00:24:50	We're pursuing a number of leads based on evidence gathered at the scene.
308	00:24:50	00:24:56	Now, we believe that our suspect targeted one individual in particular and that's where the investigation is focused.
309	00:24:56	00:25:00	Look, look, we have every available police officer out looking for him.
310	00:25:00	00:25:02	He can run, but he can't hide.
311	00:25:05	00:25:08	So, Mr. Greyburg, you don't want a lawyer?
312	00:25:08	00:25:10	Why would I need a lawyer?
313	00:25:10	00:25:16	I sent the wine over to express my gratitude for their cooperation on the article.
314	00:25:16	00:25:18	How did you get to know them?
315	00:25:18	00:25:22	I followed them around for a week as part of my research.
316	00:25:22	00:25:24	They were nice kids.
317	00:25:24	00:25:27	Uh, with big hearts.
318	00:25:27	00:25:29	It's an airhead piece.
319	00:25:29	00:25:31	My editor gave me an angle, I ran with it.
320	00:25:31	00:25:38	But those girls raised $12,000 for a fellow showgirl with breast cancer.
321	00:25:38	00:25:39	They organized their own walk-a-thon.
322	00:25:39	00:25:42	They gave out swag bags, kitchen stuff.
323	00:25:42	00:25:43	What kind of kitchen stuff?
324	00:25:43	00:25:44	Uh...
325	00:25:44	00:25:48	cutting board, juicer, kitchen knife.
326	00:25:48	00:25:50	Breast...
327	00:25:50	00:25:51	breast...
328	00:25:52	00:25:54	He stabbed you in the chest?
329	00:25:54	00:25:56	No!
330	00:25:58	00:25:59	Sara.
331	00:25:59	00:26:01	What did the knife look like?
332	00:26:01	00:26:08	It had a purple handle embossed with the name of their friend and the date.
333	00:26:08	00:26:10	It was ceramic.
334	00:26:10	00:26:13	Killer shoes.
335	00:26:16	00:26:22	There were multiple shoe impressions in blood at the house, looked just like those.
336	00:26:22	00:26:24	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
337	00:26:24	00:26:27	Look, I didn't kill those girls.
338	00:26:27	00:26:30	Where were you last night, Mr. Greyburg?
339	00:26:30	00:26:34	I was at home alone working on my novel.
340	00:26:34	00:26:35	Prove it.
341	00:26:35	00:26:39	We'll take your little ceramic knife, give us your shoes, and we'll take a sample of your DNA.
342	00:26:39	00:26:41	You can have whatever you want.
343	00:26:41	00:26:44	Just stop looking at me that way.
344	00:27:26	00:27:29	Wendy swabbed the ligatures cut from the sheet for epithelials.
345	00:27:29	00:27:34	Each knot had one DNA source on it; female, but not from the victim who was tied up.
346	00:27:34	00:27:36	So he forced them to tie each other up.
347	00:27:38	00:27:39	Tighter!
348	00:27:39	00:27:43	Please don't make me do this.
349	00:27:43	00:27:44	Thanks.
350	00:27:44	00:27:46	It was all Wendy.
351	00:27:46	00:27:47	Hey, Greg.
352	00:27:47	00:27:56	The, uh, civil suit that was filed by the Demitrius James family, DA decided not to go to trial.
353	00:27:56	00:28:00	So the city's agreed to a payout; $2.5 million.
354	00:28:00	00:28:01	$2.5 million?
355	00:28:03	00:28:05	That's like saying I'm the guilty one.
356	00:28:05	00:28:08	It's just political pragmatism.
357	00:28:08	00:28:10	City wants to cut their losses.
358	00:28:10	00:28:12	So they did throw me under the bus.
359	00:28:13	00:28:15	Comes with the job.
360	00:28:21	00:28:24	Ran a laser ablation on the knife tip from Becca's spine.
361	00:28:24	00:28:28	Zirconium oxide, otherwise known as ceramic.
362	00:28:28	00:28:30	Basically, ceramic is glass.
363	00:28:30	00:28:36	Both the exemplar that you got from the reporter and the murder weapon have the same composition, color, texture and thickness.
364	00:28:36	00:28:39	The killer could have gotten the knife from a swag bag at the walk-a-thon.
365	00:28:39	00:28:43	Either that or he could have gotten it from the house.
366	00:28:43	00:28:48	You find me the broken knife, and I'll match the tip.
367	00:28:49	00:28:52	What's wrong with you?
368	00:28:52	00:28:54	Nothing.
369	00:28:58	00:29:03	You ever do the right thing and still feel guilty about it?
370	00:29:03	00:29:05	Yeah.
371	00:29:05	00:29:07	Sucks, doesn't it?
372	00:29:07	00:29:09	Yeah.
373	00:29:17	00:29:20	So I lifted two sets of prints from the wine bottle, but there's no match to any of the victims.
374	00:29:20	00:29:22	Any hits?
375	00:29:22	00:29:24	One set was smudges.
376	00:29:24	00:29:26	I'm guessing whoever they belonged to works with their hands.
377	00:29:26	00:29:27	You know, calloused, cut.
378	00:29:28	00:29:30	The other set came back to a Chris Mullins.
379	00:29:32	00:29:34	His work card's in the system.
380	00:29:34	00:29:38	He's a musician at the Legs show where all the girls danced.
381	00:29:38	00:29:39	Well, there's a cold brewski on the table.
382	00:29:39	00:29:40	We must have just missed him.
383	00:29:40	00:29:41	Captain? Yeah, what?
384	00:29:41	00:29:43	Neighbor gave this guy up.
385	00:29:43	00:29:44	Mullins hangs out at a bar right down the street.
386	00:29:44	00:29:45	All right, we'll check it out.
387	00:29:45	00:29:47	But first we're going to lose the radio cars.
388	00:29:47	00:29:48	Post an unmarked.
389	00:29:48	00:29:49	I'm going to put a broadcast out on his vehicle.
390	00:29:50	00:29:51	He's gotta come home sometime.
391	00:29:51	00:29:54	Control, this is 2-0-3 Charlie, Captain Brass.
392	00:29:54	00:29:57	Go ahead, Captain. (sirens wailing)
393	00:29:57	00:29:59	Whoo!
394	00:29:59	00:30:00	Did you call for backup?
395	00:30:00	00:30:04	Look, uh, two squad cars just passed rolling Code Three.
396	00:30:04	00:30:06	I'm at 562 Herrick Drive.
397	00:30:06	00:30:08	Where are they en route to?
398	00:30:08	00:30:12	Units are responding to a 415 Baker in progress outside the Trip Wire Bar.
399	00:30:12	00:30:14	Person down, suspect possibly still in location.
400	00:30:14	00:30:15	All right, copy that.
401	00:30:15	00:30:17	I'm headed to the 415B location.
402	00:30:17	00:30:18	Assault with a deadly weapon?
403	00:30:18	00:30:20	Feeling lucky?
404	00:30:23	00:30:25	Sir, could you move your hand, please?
405	00:30:25	00:30:26	Please?
406	00:30:26	00:30:28	Thank you.
407	00:30:28	00:30:31	Hey, what do you got?
408	00:30:31	00:30:32	Marlon Frost, out of state.
409	00:30:32	00:30:33	Bar patron found him.
410	00:30:33	00:30:35	Anyone see the suspect?
411	00:30:35	00:30:36	Mm-mm, no witnesses.
412	00:30:37	00:30:38	Okay, I'm going inside. Chris Mullins hangs out here.
413	00:30:38	00:30:40	Somebody's got to know something.
414	00:30:40	00:30:43	Incise wound to the neck? Yeah.
415	00:30:43	00:30:44	Seems to be flavor of the week.
416	00:30:44	00:30:46	Did he say anything?
417	00:30:46	00:30:48	I don't think he can.
418	00:30:54	00:30:55	Hey, Sara?
419	00:30:55	00:30:59	Got a knife over here.
420	00:30:59	00:31:00	Tip's broken off.
421	00:31:00	00:31:02	That's probably going to be the murder weapon right there.
422	00:31:07	00:31:12	And it matches the one from the swag bag.
423	00:31:12	00:31:15	Crime scene's only a couple blocks from here.
424	00:31:15	00:31:16	I'm going to go with the vic.
425	00:31:16	00:31:18	I'm going to collect his clothes.
426	00:31:18	00:31:22	You sure that's really such a good idea?
427	00:31:22	00:31:24	Hold up! I'm coming with you.
428	00:31:32	00:31:34	My name is Sara.
429	00:31:34	00:31:37	Just hold on. You're going to be fine.
430	00:31:44	00:31:47	Do you know who did this to you?
431	00:31:53	00:31:55	Seen this guy?
432	00:31:55	00:31:56	Marlon Frost?
433	00:31:56	00:31:57	He was just stabbed in the parking lot.
434	00:31:57	00:31:59	Yeah, I seen him around last couple of days.
435	00:32:00	00:32:01	Friendly enough.
436	00:32:01	00:32:03	What, did he get into an argument or something here?
437	00:32:03	00:32:04	It's not that type of place.
438	00:32:04	00:32:05	Yeah, right.
439	00:32:05	00:32:07	Uh, how about this guy?
440	00:32:07	00:32:08	You see him? Chris Mullins?
441	00:32:08	00:32:10	Yeah, he's a regular of mine.
442	00:32:10	00:32:11	A-lister with the ladies, you know.
443	00:32:12	00:32:13	Has he been in lately?
444	00:32:13	00:32:15	Why don't you check in the back?
445	00:32:16	00:32:17	Great.
446	00:32:19	00:32:22	Chris Mullins?
447	00:32:22	00:32:23	Yeah?
448	00:32:23	00:32:25	I hope you washed your hands.
449	00:32:25	00:32:29	I didn't stab that guy, I didn't kill those girls.
450	00:32:29	00:32:31	I will cop to drinking their wine.
451	00:32:31	00:32:33	So you're in the house the night of the murders.
452	00:32:33	00:32:36	I'd been messing around with Lauren since last weekend.
453	00:32:36	00:32:38	You know, you don't seem too upset that she's dead.
454	00:32:40	00:32:44	How come your fingerprints are in every single room of the house?
455	00:32:44	00:32:45	It's kind of an inside joke.
456	00:32:45	00:32:49	We did it in all her roommates' beds just to see if they noticed.
457	00:32:49	00:32:51	But you're only having sex with Lauren, right?
458	00:32:51	00:32:55	She was a good place to put it till something better came along.
459	00:32:55	00:32:58	I guess that's funny to somebody.
460	00:32:58	00:33:04	But when we get a warrant for your DNA and match it to the semen we found in Lauren and Emily, the joke is going to be on you, pal.
461	00:33:06	00:33:09	I was supposed to meet Lauren after her last show.
462	00:33:10	00:33:12	She was late.
463	00:33:12	00:33:13	Emily was home.
464	00:33:13	00:33:15	And you couldn't help yourself, right, stud?
465	00:33:15	00:33:17	Girl politics.
466	00:33:17	00:33:19	One wants what the other has.
467	00:33:19	00:33:20	Why not give it?
468	00:33:20	00:33:23	So I guess when Lauren came home, you gave it to her, too.
469	00:33:24	00:33:26	Is that right, Santa?
470	00:33:26	00:33:28	And what about Becca?
471	00:33:28	00:33:29	Was she blonde?
472	00:33:29	00:33:31	I didn't meet all the roommates.
473	00:33:31	00:33:34	Boy, you have an answer for everything, huh?
474	00:33:34	00:33:37	What about the guy in the bar?
475	00:33:37	00:33:41	What about him, what did he do, look at you the wrong way, bum a smoke?
476	00:33:41	00:33:44	Or did he want you to give it to him, too?
477	00:33:44	00:33:45	You know what?
478	00:33:45	00:33:47	Lawyer. Now.
479	00:33:47	00:33:51	Well, DNA confirmed that Mullins had sex with Emily and Lauren.
480	00:33:51	00:33:55	Assuming he's the killer, why didn't we find any semen in Becca?
481	00:33:55	00:33:58	Maybe by the time he got to her, he was unable to ejaculate.
482	00:33:58	00:34:03	I was able to make a physical match between the broken tip in Becca and the knife recovered from outside the bar.
483	00:34:03	00:34:05	Was the same knife used to stab Marlon Frost?
484	00:34:05	00:34:07	We don't know yet.
485	00:34:07	00:34:12	Sara's at the hospital now-- she's bringing back a DNA sample to compare. Whoever...
486	00:34:13	00:34:14	shanked Frost killed those girls.
487	00:34:14	00:34:17	Did you get any prints on that knife? Yeah. No ridge detail.
488	00:34:17	00:34:20	Same smudges were found on the wine bottles and in the bedrooms.
489	00:34:20	00:34:24	Smudges won't put the knife in Mullins' hands, though. I don't get it.
490	00:34:24	00:34:26	He stabs the guy and walks back in the bar.
491	00:34:26	00:34:31	All the evidence at the house suggests that the killer was unfamiliar with the layout.
492	00:34:31	00:34:35	And by his own admission, Mullins had been in that house at least a couple of nights.
493	00:34:35	00:34:39	Well, that's also how he could've made the connection to Becca.
494	00:34:43	00:34:46	Mr. Frost, I'll be out of your way soon.
495	00:34:48	00:34:50	I'm sure you want to get some sleep.
496	00:34:50	00:34:53	I just need to get your fingerprints.
497	00:34:53	00:34:54	It's routine.
498	00:34:54	00:34:56	I promise it won't hurt.
499	00:35:46	00:35:49	Get off me!
500	00:35:49	00:35:51	Get off me!
501	00:36:01	00:36:05	Port... port wine... port wine.
502	00:36:05	00:36:09	He has a vascular birthmark, a port wine stain, on his upper chest-- that's what Cammie was trying to tell me.
503	00:36:09	00:36:14	We can get DNA off his bloody clothes, but we have no blood or semen at the scene to compare it to.
504	00:36:14	00:36:15	His prints are useless-- they're all calluses.
505	00:36:15	00:36:18	They only leave smudges, like the kind we found on the broken knife.
506	00:36:18	00:36:21	I think the bastard tried to kill himself. Sara, slow down.
507	00:36:21	00:36:29	Frost isn't going anywhere. I am going to nail this son of a bitch, and I don't want him to think for a single second that he is going to get away with this. Okay, one step at a time.
508	00:36:29	00:36:32	Frost smelled like alcohol when they took him into the E.R, so they ran a tox.
509	00:36:32	00:36:36	His BAC came back .34-- only a chronic alcoholic can function at those levels.
510	00:36:36	00:36:40	You know what I think? I think he polished off the wine at the scene straight from the bottle.
511	00:36:40	00:36:45	So his DNA should be on it.
512	00:36:45	00:36:48	The suspect's name is David Marlon. M-A-R-L-O-N.
513	00:36:48	00:36:51	Also known as Marlon Frost.
514	00:36:51	00:36:56	Released from California state penitentiary where he served time for sexual assault.
515	00:36:56	00:37:03	Mr. Marlon is also wanted in the questioning of the assault of an elderly woman in north Lake Tahoe one week ago.
516	00:37:03	00:37:07	We believe he stole her vehicle and then fled to Las Vegas.
517	00:37:07	00:37:09	Where'd Brass find it?
518	00:37:09	00:37:11	A block away from the bar.
519	00:37:11	00:37:13	Guy didn't even bother to switch plates.
520	00:37:13	00:37:15	Smart.
521	00:37:21	00:37:23	Whoa.
522	00:37:23	00:37:26	One, two...
523	00:37:26	00:37:29	three, four, five, six...
524	00:37:29	00:37:31	ladies' handbags.
525	00:37:36	00:37:37	Rebecca Mayford.
526	00:37:38	00:37:40	Becca.
527	00:37:40	00:37:46	Mm. Looks like she was trying to quit smoking.
528	00:37:46	00:37:47	And failing.
529	00:37:47	00:37:49	Miserably.
530	00:37:51	00:37:52	There is only one missing.
531	00:37:57	00:37:59	Here we go.
532	00:37:59	00:38:04	Bought at the Trip Wire Bar 48 a.m. same night as the murders.
533	00:38:04	00:38:07	That's where Marlon and Becca crossed paths.
534	00:38:07	00:38:08	There you go.
535	00:38:12	00:38:15	Appreciate it. Bye.
536	00:38:29	00:38:31	I got a gun.
537	00:38:35	00:38:37	It's plastic.
538	00:38:39	00:38:41	It's a toy.
539	00:38:41	00:38:42	Looks real to me.
540	00:38:43	00:38:44	Imagine if you're petrified.
541	00:38:52	00:38:54	How'd you find me?
542	00:38:54	00:38:56	Cammie had these in her wallet.
543	00:38:56	00:38:59	We tracked you from the birth certificate.
544	00:38:59	00:39:00	She's a cutie.
545	00:39:01	00:39:03	What's her name?
546	00:39:03	00:39:04	Fin.
547	00:39:04	00:39:06	After Cammie's grandmother.
548	00:39:06	00:39:11	But her adoptive parents call her Annabelle.
549	00:39:11	00:39:13	She kept in touch with them?
550	00:39:13	00:39:14	They're pretty cool.
551	00:39:14	00:39:17	We didn't have contact, but...
552	00:39:17	00:39:20	they would send Cammie a photo every year on Fin's birthday.
553	00:39:20	00:39:27	And every year, Cammie and I would get together, have a beer, look at it.
554	00:39:28	00:39:35	Biggest regret of my life is not marrying Cammie and raising Fin together.
555	00:39:35	00:39:37	I wanted to, but...
556	00:39:37	00:39:40	she said we were too young.
557	00:39:40	00:39:41	Maybe if we had...
558	00:39:41	00:39:43	Corey...
559	00:39:43	00:39:45	you can't blame yourself.
560	00:39:45	00:39:49	Were you with her when she died?
561	00:39:52	00:39:56	At least Cammie died knowing kindness.
562	00:39:56	00:39:58	Stay with me, Cammie.
563	00:39:58	00:40:02	Bye... Fin...
564	00:40:05	00:40:07	I watched the life go out of their eyes.
565	00:40:07	00:40:09	Um, life drains.
566	00:40:09	00:40:12	That's... that's how you can tell they're dead.
567	00:40:12	00:40:15	They have, uh, empty eyes.
568	00:40:17	00:40:19	That's not what I asked you.
569	00:40:19	00:40:23	What I asked you was, why did you kill them?
570	00:40:23	00:40:26	I saw this girl I liked at the bar.
571	00:40:27	00:40:29	I followed her home.
572	00:40:31	00:40:33	I knew she wanted to party.
573	00:40:35	00:40:37	I chose her.
574	00:40:39	00:40:45	Girls act... sometimes like they don't want what they want...
575	00:40:45	00:40:48	because they want you to take it.
576	00:40:48	00:40:50	They like that.
577	00:40:51	00:40:53	But this girl...
578	00:40:53	00:40:56	she was flirting with me.
579	00:40:58	00:41:03	And I... I just gave her the party of her life.
580	00:41:03	00:41:07	You know, there's something I don't understand, Marlon.
581	00:41:09	00:41:11	Why are you smiling?
582	00:41:11	00:41:14	You feel good about this?
583	00:41:14	00:41:17	I don't feel anything.
584	00:41:18	00:41:20	Nothing.
585	00:41:20	00:41:26	Las Vegas PD has confirmed that David Marlon confessed earlier today to the murders of the six Green Valley showgirls.
586	00:41:26	00:41:32	He was found within a block of the crime scene in an apparent suicide attempt.
587	00:41:32	00:41:34	I've just been informed...
588	00:41:34	00:41:35	I held his hand.
589	00:41:36	00:41:38	...has confirmed the names of the six victims.
590	00:41:38	00:41:40	They are Cammie...
591	00:41:40	00:41:42	Just like I held hers.
592	00:41:42	00:41:45	Libby Cooperson 22, Becca Mayfield, 20...
593	00:41:45	00:41:48	I lost perspective.
594	00:41:48	00:41:52	...Lauren Walderson 21 and Emily Wilson, 19.
595	00:41:52	00:41:58	Their families have organized a candlelight vigil that will begin here tonight.
