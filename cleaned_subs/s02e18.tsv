0	00:00:11	00:00:13	So what do you think? I mean come on.
1	00:00:13	00:00:16	I earned this vacation. You ever been married?
2	00:00:17	00:00:19	When it's good, it's great.
3	00:00:19	00:00:22	When it's over, it's even better, hmm?
4	00:00:25	00:00:28	I'm telling you, the seven comes up every six rolls.
5	00:00:28	00:00:29	I've got a system.
6	00:00:29	00:00:31	You know what the casinos say about guys with systems?
7	00:00:31	00:00:32	What?
8	00:00:32	00:00:34	Welcome.
9	00:00:35	00:00:36	He doesn't know what he's talking about.
10	00:00:36	00:00:39	Everything you need to know about craps is right in this book.
11	00:00:40	00:00:43	I was talking to Shirley-- she said the only way to make money in that town is slots.
12	00:00:51	00:00:52	I'm up 1,500.
13	00:00:52	00:00:54	That's nice, dear.
14	00:00:54	00:00:56	Oh, I found it's pictures. Now look at this.
15	00:00:57	00:00:58	Oh, look at him.
16	00:00:58	00:01:00	He's just learning how to walk.
17	00:01:00	00:01:03	Here's another one with his sister.
18	00:01:03	00:01:04	Oh, there it is.
19	00:01:05	00:01:07	You have a beautiful family.
20	00:01:07	00:01:08	We've been blessed.
21	00:01:08	00:01:11	Yes, we sure have been blessed.
22	00:01:14	00:01:17	Well, folks, we just hit Mountain Pass.
23	00:01:17	00:01:20	Means we're about 40 miles outside of Vegas.
24	00:01:20	00:01:23	Some of you are going to be driving back with me.
25	00:01:23	00:01:27	Some of you are going to be flying back with all the money you're going to win.
26	00:01:28	00:01:33	In any case you just sit back, relax we'll see if we can't get you there ahead of schedule.
27	00:01:41	00:01:42	Hey.
28	00:01:42	00:01:44	Want a nip?
29	00:01:47	00:01:49	No, I know my limits.
30	00:02:44	00:02:45	Everybody stand by.
31	00:02:45	00:02:48	We do not touch this car until every victim is off the bus.
32	00:03:03	00:03:05	I feel so useless.
33	00:03:06	00:03:09	It's still a rescue operation.
34	00:03:11	00:03:14	We're not running the show.
35	00:03:14	00:03:15	Not yet.
36	00:03:22	00:03:26	They do their job and then we do ours.
37	00:04:04	00:04:06	Mine are lined up right over there.
38	00:04:11	00:04:14	Walt?
39	00:04:14	00:04:15	Where's my husband?
40	00:04:16	00:04:18	Walter?
41	00:04:18	00:04:20	Walter...
42	00:04:22	00:04:25	All right, I want everybody thinking worst case scenario.
43	00:04:25	00:04:26	The highway's finally ours.
44	00:04:26	00:04:32	Cones and pictures, skid marks ice patches, loose asphalt anything and everything.
45	00:04:32	00:04:32	All right.
46	00:04:32	00:04:33	It's a pretty wide area up there.
47	00:04:33	00:04:35	Are we clear to call in for help?
48	00:04:35	00:04:37	Every Las Vegas CSI is on their way here.
49	00:04:37	00:04:38	Cadets?
50	00:04:38	00:04:40	Call them.
51	00:04:56	00:05:00	...1-25 Roger...
52	00:05:02	00:05:04	You the only trauma doc?
53	00:05:04	00:05:05	That's right.
54	00:05:05	00:05:07	Lucky me.
55	00:05:07	00:05:08	I personally black-tagged six.
56	00:05:08	00:05:09	Excuse me.
57	00:05:10	00:05:12	My line of work, that's a bad night.
58	00:05:12	00:05:13	Yeah, mine, too.
59	00:05:13	00:05:15	That the bus driver over there?
60	00:05:15	00:05:18	Big surprise. Only person on the bus wearing a seat-belt.
61	00:05:18	00:05:20	Only one on a tour bus required to wear one.
62	00:05:20	00:05:22	Thank you.
63	00:05:22	00:05:24	Hey. Got here as soon as I could.
64	00:05:24	00:05:26	Whoa, what are you doing here, Greg? All hands on deck.
65	00:05:26	00:05:28	That was the call, right? Crims on the scene.
66	00:05:28	00:05:30	Crims with field training.
67	00:05:30	00:05:31	Come on.
68	00:05:31	00:05:32	I'm capable.
69	00:05:32	00:05:34	He does no collection.
70	00:05:36	00:05:38	You're taking my notes.
71	00:05:38	00:05:40	You didn't bring a warmer jacket?
72	00:05:40	00:05:41	No.
73	00:05:46	00:05:48	Listen, I'll, uh...
74	00:05:48	00:05:49	I'll do anything that I can.
75	00:05:49	00:05:51	I just want to help. Please.
76	00:05:51	00:05:54	No, sir, just, uh, uh, stick around.
77	00:05:54	00:05:56	I'll be right here.
78	00:05:56	00:05:57	Thank you.
79	00:06:02	00:06:05	Hey. Uh, Larry Maddox.
80	00:06:05	00:06:06	Owns the bus company.
81	00:06:06	00:06:09	Got here quick. That should tell you something.
82	00:06:09	00:06:13	Yeah, he coughed up the passenger manifest including the driver, Martin Draper.
83	00:06:13	00:06:16	24 passengers, one PAL.
84	00:06:16	00:06:17	Parolee-at-large.
85	00:06:17	00:06:19	Calvin McBride.
86	00:06:19	00:06:20	Seat One-C.
87	00:06:20	00:06:22	California State Pen, two years, aggravated assault.
88	00:06:23	00:06:24	He was paroled last week.
89	00:06:24	00:06:25	And already over state lines.
90	00:06:25	00:06:27	It was news to his parole officer.
91	00:06:27	00:06:28	I'm sure it was.
92	00:06:28	00:06:32	You know, my guys are matching names to faces both here and at the hospital.
93	00:06:32	00:06:35	McBride tops the list. I'm going to talk to Maddox.
94	00:06:39	00:06:41	Let's roll.
95	00:07:00	00:07:03	Fire Department says the driver of the Camaro's dead.
96	00:07:03	00:07:07	Yeah, I heard, but I think I know why the bus pulled to the right.
97	00:07:07	00:07:10	Now that is a serious blowout.
98	00:07:10	00:07:14	And the front left tire's still intact.
99	00:07:15	00:07:18	For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
100	00:07:19	00:07:20	Tire to rim.
101	00:07:20	00:07:21	Rim to axle.
102	00:07:22	00:07:23	Axle to suspension.
103	00:07:23	00:07:25	Suspension to frame.
104	00:07:25	00:07:28	And the lower radius rod arm...
105	00:07:28	00:07:31	which connects the axle to the frame.
106	00:07:31	00:07:33	Not anymore.
107	00:07:36	00:07:39	So, if the rod arm broke while he was driving...
108	00:07:41	00:07:43	Driver tried to maintain control.
109	00:07:43	00:07:45	Veered to the left.
110	00:07:45	00:07:48	But turning the wheel was probably going to make things worse.
111	00:07:48	00:07:51	Putting pressure on the right front tire causing it to blow.
112	00:07:51	00:07:54	The... the bus then veers to the right.
113	00:07:54	00:07:56	Goes off the road.
114	00:07:56	00:07:57	And we're back to Newton.
115	00:07:58	00:08:01	The theory's correct if the rod arm was the first action.
116	00:08:01	00:08:06	I'm gonna see what's going on with that Camaro.
117	00:08:24	00:08:26	...1-41 north...
118	00:08:38	00:08:39	Rescue!
119	00:08:40	00:08:42	Can you tell me your name?
120	00:08:48	00:08:50	Miss, you need to let him go.
121	00:08:52	00:08:55	Let's go on three. One, two, three, in.
122	00:09:02	00:09:05	This never happened to me before.
123	00:09:05	00:09:08	The wheel just sh-shook right out of my hands.
124	00:09:09	00:09:11	How long after your scheduled stop in Barstow?
125	00:09:11	00:09:15	We, uh, we-we always stop in Barstow.
126	00:09:15	00:09:19	Uh, McDonald's the, uh, the train station one.
127	00:09:19	00:09:25	I understand that, Mr. Draper, but how long after that did the wheel start to shake on you?
128	00:09:25	00:09:28	Uh...
129	00:09:28	00:09:31	I don't, uh...
130	00:09:31	00:09:32	I don't...
131	00:09:32	00:09:34	Sir, are you okay?
132	00:09:34	00:09:35	No.
133	00:09:35	00:09:37	We're behind schedule.
134	00:09:37	00:09:38	I got to get back to the bus.
135	00:09:38	00:09:39	Hold on, hold on.
136	00:09:39	00:09:41	Wait a second.
137	00:09:41	00:09:44	Mr. Draper...
138	00:09:46	00:09:49	Mr. Draper, have you had anything to drink at all?
139	00:09:51	00:09:54	I'm going to do a preliminary field breath test.
140	00:09:54	00:09:56	Keep an eye on Mr. Draper, will you, Greg?
141	00:09:56	00:09:57	Sure, right.
142	00:09:57	00:09:59	I, uh, I got to go.
143	00:09:59	00:10:01	Won't take a minute. I understand.
144	00:10:01	00:10:02	I understand. Hang tight.
145	00:10:02	00:10:04	See, uh, there's people...
146	00:10:04	00:10:05	I understand.
147	00:10:05	00:10:09	I want you to take a deep breath, and I want you to blow into the end of this for me, okay?
148	00:10:15	00:10:17	I need a doctor over here.
149	00:10:17	00:10:18	Greg, get some help.
150	00:10:18	00:10:20	Greg!
151	00:10:20	00:10:21	Greg!
152	00:10:21	00:10:23	Get some help!
153	00:10:25	00:10:27	It's all right, man.
154	00:10:27	00:10:28	Stop apologizing.
155	00:10:28	00:10:29	Oh, I feel bad.
156	00:10:29	00:10:31	I just froze up.
157	00:10:31	00:10:34	That's why we have fielding training, Greg.
158	00:10:34	00:10:37	No disrespect, but you're not qualified to be out here.
159	00:10:37	00:10:41	I guess I just wasn't expecting blood to look like that.
160	00:10:41	00:10:43	Pre-collection, so different.
161	00:10:43	00:10:44	Yup.
162	00:10:45	00:10:46	I remember my first time in the field.
163	00:10:47	00:10:48	CSI One.
164	00:10:48	00:10:49	Green as could be.
165	00:10:49	00:10:51	Initial call was a robbery.
166	00:10:51	00:10:53	I get there, triple homicide.
167	00:10:53	00:10:56	Blood all over the place, mother and two kids.
168	00:10:56	00:10:58	How do you deal?
169	00:10:58	00:11:00	You just do.
170	00:11:04	00:11:06	Okay, what's next?
171	00:11:06	00:11:08	Well, we're missing a passenger.
172	00:11:08	00:11:12	The only one unaccounted for is an ex-con named Calvin McBride.
173	00:11:12	00:11:16	According to Brass, he wasn't admitted to the hospital and he's not in any of the body bags.
174	00:11:16	00:11:18	What about the rest stop in Barstow?
175	00:11:18	00:11:20	CHP and the Barstow PD are looking.
176	00:11:21	00:11:24	Anybody check the bus?
177	00:11:29	00:11:31	I'll find out.
178	00:12:03	00:12:06	Firefighters only look in the obvious spots.
179	00:12:08	00:12:12	Just out of curiosity, what are the unobvious spots?
180	00:12:12	00:12:14	For bodies?
181	00:12:14	00:12:21	Walls, hot water heaters stuffed in the box spring of a hotel room bed.
182	00:12:21	00:12:23	I found a head in a bucket of paint once.
183	00:12:24	00:12:26	I get the picture.
184	00:12:34	00:12:36	What do you see?
185	00:12:36	00:12:39	Well...
186	00:12:39	00:12:41	McBride's not on the bus.
187	00:13:03	00:13:06	Grissom.
188	00:13:06	00:13:11	Cheap whiskey broken bottle, brown paper bag.
189	00:13:11	00:13:15	You know, I never gave the bus driver a breath test.
190	00:13:19	00:13:24	Greg bag this, take it to the lab swab the rim for DNA.
191	00:13:28	00:13:30	You should be wearing gloves.
192	00:13:31	00:13:33	Sorry.
193	00:13:37	00:13:39	This guy was in 1C.
194	00:13:47	00:13:52	Seat 1C was the only seat with an unobstructed path through the windshield.
195	00:14:02	00:14:04	Where's the other half of this windshield?
196	00:14:23	00:14:26	Laminated safety glass, pops in, pops out.
197	00:14:40	00:14:43	Hello, Mr. McBride.
198	00:14:45	00:14:48	I'm afraid our ex-con just got the death penalty.
199	00:14:51	00:14:54	He's one of the victims in the bus crash.
200	00:14:54	00:14:56	He was in the Camaro.
201	00:14:56	00:14:57	He was driving the Camaro.
202	00:14:57	00:14:58	Excuse me.
203	00:14:58	00:15:00	Ma'am, not now.
204	00:15:00	00:15:02	Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
205	00:15:02	00:15:03	This will just take a second.
206	00:15:03	00:15:04	Can you tell me your name?
207	00:15:04	00:15:05	Eric. Eric?
208	00:15:05	00:15:09	I just wanted to surprise her. That's all.
209	00:15:09	00:15:12	If I don't make it please tell her I'm sorry.
210	00:15:12	00:15:13	Ma'am, this is the operating room.
211	00:15:13	00:15:14	You need to leave.
212	00:15:18	00:15:22	I need the two front wheels, axle, suspension, all of it.
213	00:15:23	00:15:25	The whole front undercarriage.
214	00:15:35	00:15:37	Excuse me, Miss.
215	00:15:37	00:15:38	This is a crime scene.
216	00:15:38	00:15:39	It's off limits.
217	00:15:40	00:15:41	I know.
218	00:15:41	00:15:43	I was, uh, I was on the bus.
219	00:15:48	00:15:49	Why are you here?
220	00:15:51	00:15:53	I don't...
221	00:15:53	00:15:55	I don't know.
222	00:16:00	00:16:01	I'm sorry.
223	00:16:22	00:16:24	Shreds of rubber everywhere.
224	00:16:24	00:16:28	Between the crash, and all the other interstate traffic it might as well be the Indy 500.
225	00:16:28	00:16:30	This stuff could be from any vehicle.
226	00:16:30	00:16:34	There's no doubt that this bus body-checked this K-Rail.
227	00:17:19	00:17:21	You've got that Sara look.
228	00:17:21	00:17:24	You mean that Grissom look?
229	00:17:24	00:17:27	Second set of skid marks.
230	00:17:27	00:17:28	Camaro.
231	00:17:28	00:17:30	I got a theory.
232	00:17:31	00:17:34	Grissom said the suspension gave on the bus, right?
233	00:17:34	00:17:37	Broken rod arm.
234	00:17:37	00:17:42	Well, I'm thinking when that rod arm hit the pavement it made this great first impression here.
235	00:17:48	00:17:50	If this is the bus...
236	00:17:50	00:17:52	the bus begins to slide right.
237	00:17:52	00:17:53	Driver overcorrects.
238	00:17:55	00:17:59	Crosses the highway slams into the K-Rail.
239	00:18:01	00:18:06	Meanwhile the Camaro's holding steady in the right lane heading straight for us.
240	00:18:06	00:18:08	Bus bounces off this K-Rail...
241	00:18:09	00:18:11	heads back towards us.
242	00:18:11	00:18:13	Taking out anything in its path.
243	00:18:16	00:18:20	Bus crosses four lanes of traffic and only takes out the car behind it?
244	00:18:20	00:18:24	Someone upstairs was looking out big-time.
245	00:18:29	00:18:30	Hey, boss.
246	00:18:32	00:18:34	I had a feeling you were coming.
247	00:18:34	00:18:36	I ran the DNA on that whiskey bottle.
248	00:18:36	00:18:37	You'll never guess.
249	00:18:37	00:18:40	It's not the bus driver but I do have an answer behind door number two.
250	00:18:40	00:18:42	Seat number 1C.
251	00:18:42	00:18:44	Calvin McBride.
252	00:18:44	00:18:45	He's an ex-con. Found his DNA in CODIS.
253	00:18:45	00:18:47	Good, Greg.
254	00:18:49	00:18:51	Did you enjoy being in the field?
255	00:18:51	00:18:53	You heard about it, too?
256	00:18:53	00:18:55	What?
257	00:18:55	00:18:56	That I...
258	00:18:57	00:18:58	messed up.
259	00:18:59	00:19:00	No.
260	00:19:02	00:19:03	Well, then I enjoyed it fine.
261	00:19:08	00:19:10	You're telling me this guy wasn't intoxicated.
262	00:19:10	00:19:14	Not a drop of ethanol in his system not even from cough syrup.
263	00:19:14	00:19:16	He could barely put a sentence together.
264	00:19:16	00:19:18	If he wasn't drunk, then what was he?
265	00:19:18	00:19:19	My guess, hungry.
266	00:19:19	00:19:22	Driver's medical eval taken just last month.
267	00:19:22	00:19:25	Martin Draper, 40.
268	00:19:25	00:19:26	Overweight.
269	00:19:26	00:19:30	One of 15 million people in this country suffering from Type II diabetes.
270	00:19:30	00:19:31	On any medication?
271	00:19:31	00:19:35	Primary course of treatment would have been exercise and weight loss to lower blood sugar.
272	00:19:36	00:19:37	Doesn't look like he was hitting the gym.
273	00:19:38	00:19:39	But he was dieting.
274	00:19:39	00:19:40	Crash dieting.
275	00:19:40	00:19:42	Didn't find any food in his stomach.
276	00:19:42	00:19:45	Means he hadn't eaten anything in at least six hours.
277	00:19:45	00:19:47	An empty stomach invites hypoglycemia.
278	00:19:48	00:19:50	Symptoms of which can mirror intoxication.
279	00:19:50	00:19:52	And in extreme cases?
280	00:19:52	00:19:56	Loss of consciousness and seizure.
281	00:19:56	00:19:57	Do I pass?
282	00:19:57	00:19:58	Cum laude.
283	00:19:58	00:19:59	Cause of death?
284	00:19:59	00:20:00	Just what you'd expect.
285	00:20:00	00:20:02	Massive injuries, internal bleeding.
286	00:20:02	00:20:04	So, if we're not looking at the driver...
287	00:20:04	00:20:06	We're looking at the bus.
288	00:20:32	00:20:33	Check this out.
289	00:20:37	00:20:38	A bolt?
290	00:20:38	00:20:39	Nice.
291	00:20:39	00:20:41	I got 20 of them.
292	00:20:41	00:20:43	Well, this one's sheared.
293	00:20:44	00:20:46	It is, isn't it?
294	00:21:15	00:21:18	Bus company just faxed over a maintenance report.
295	00:21:18	00:21:20	Bus was in perfect working order.
296	00:21:20	00:21:21	Serviced last week.
297	00:21:23	00:21:25	Does this look like it's in perfect working order?
298	00:21:25	00:21:28	Uh... no.
299	00:21:28	00:21:30	What'd you get?
300	00:21:30	00:21:31	Three-quarter inch bolt.
301	00:21:31	00:21:34	It matches the bolt on the specs for this suspension system.
302	00:21:34	00:21:36	The hex head says it's a grade eight.
303	00:21:40	00:21:41	Snapped in half?
304	00:21:41	00:21:44	Bolts are graded according to their hardness.
305	00:21:44	00:21:46	The higher the grade, the stronger the steel.
306	00:21:46	00:21:48	A grade eight bolt shouldn't snap like a toothpick.
307	00:21:48	00:21:50	Did you do a Rockwell Hardness test?
308	00:21:50	00:21:51	Yeah, I hit it with the Tru-Blue.
309	00:21:51	00:21:53	It's not a grade eight. It's a grade five.
310	00:22:02	00:22:04	Often when there's one...
311	00:22:07	00:22:08	there's another one.
312	00:22:11	00:22:13	Bus company was using bogus bolts.
313	00:22:14	00:22:18	Inferior bolts would cause the suspension to give the bus veers off the road.
314	00:22:18	00:22:21	If the sheared bolts were the first action.
315	00:22:21	00:22:26	No, the bolts snapped midway through the skid after the bus hit the K-Rail.
316	00:22:26	00:22:27	Proof?
317	00:22:28	00:22:29	The gouge in the road.
318	00:22:32	00:22:35	Broken rod arm, maybe?
319	00:22:35	00:22:36	Okay.
320	00:22:36	00:22:38	Driver hits the brakes, initiates the skid.
321	00:22:40	00:22:41	Why'd he hit the brakes?
322	00:22:41	00:22:42	Another vehicle.
323	00:22:42	00:22:45	Nope, only two sets of fresh skid marks on that stretch of highway.
324	00:22:46	00:22:49	And the Camaro's skid marks place it behind the bus.
325	00:22:49	00:22:52	So I ask again-- why'd he hit the brakes?
326	00:22:53	00:22:55	Man, there could be a million reasons.
327	00:22:55	00:22:58	Well, fortunately, we're just looking for one.
328	00:23:09	00:23:11	The kid in the Camaro didn't make it.
329	00:23:12	00:23:14	Eric Kevlin, 32.
330	00:23:14	00:23:16	He was a resident at the UCLA Med Center.
331	00:23:16	00:23:19	He was on his way to Vegas to surprise his girlfriend.
332	00:23:19	00:23:22	Only to end up pinned under a bus.
333	00:23:22	00:23:24	But he's rescued.
334	00:23:24	00:23:27	Given a second chance on life.
335	00:23:27	00:23:30	And, uh... he signs this.
336	00:23:33	00:23:34	It's a pre-op DNR.
337	00:23:34	00:23:36	Do not resuscitate?
338	00:23:36	00:23:39	It doesn't make sense for a young person.
339	00:23:39	00:23:41	Why refuse CPR?
340	00:23:43	00:23:45	Our company has an excellent safety record.
341	00:23:45	00:23:46	Until last night.
342	00:23:46	00:23:50	Look, you own an airline or a bus company-- any transport business-- accidents are inevitable.
343	00:23:50	00:23:52	Criminal acts, however, are another matter.
344	00:23:52	00:23:53	Wait a minute.
345	00:23:53	00:23:53	I've got a family.
346	00:23:53	00:23:55	Sometimes they ride my buses.
347	00:23:55	00:23:57	I don't take a chance with their lives or anybody else's.
348	00:23:57	00:23:58	I screen all my drivers.
349	00:23:58	00:24:00	Zero tolerance for drugs or alcohol.
350	00:24:00	00:24:02	I keep strict maintenance records.
351	00:24:02	00:24:05	Vehicle inspection every 45 days as required by law.
352	00:24:05	00:24:07	You're not going to find anything criminal here.
353	00:24:08	00:24:10	I believe this belongs to you.
354	00:24:12	00:24:14	Bolt, grade eight.
355	00:24:14	00:24:16	Sheared.
356	00:24:16	00:24:17	It doesn't happen.
357	00:24:17	00:24:19	The front suspension was riddled with these.
358	00:24:21	00:24:23	We have more questions about the accident but one thing we know.
359	00:24:24	00:24:25	The suspension didn't hold.
360	00:24:25	00:24:28	I buy all my spare parts from reputable companies.
361	00:24:28	00:24:29	We only care about the bolts.
362	00:24:29	00:24:31	Brillway Bolt Company.
363	00:24:31	00:24:33	I just switched; they were low bid.
364	00:24:35	00:24:37	The consequences of saving a buck.
365	00:24:38	00:24:40	I think maybe it's time for another inspection.
366	00:24:42	00:24:44	I'll ground the fleet.
367	00:25:33	00:25:35	I get it.
368	00:25:35	00:25:36	It's busy here in Barstow.
369	00:25:36	00:25:38	But you do remember the bus?
370	00:25:38	00:25:40	Yeah, I knew the driver. Marty.
371	00:25:40	00:25:42	Always fill him up on the return trip.
372	00:25:42	00:25:45	I remember this one guy kept checking me out.
373	00:25:45	00:25:46	Bought a lot of turkey jerky.
374	00:25:46	00:25:49	Oh, and this one couple was having a fight.
375	00:25:49	00:25:51	Did, uh, did they come off the bus?
376	00:25:51	00:25:53	I don't know.
377	00:25:53	00:25:54	But you do remember the bus?
378	00:25:54	00:25:56	Of course.
379	00:25:56	00:25:57	Mojave Express.
380	00:25:57	00:25:58	Always on time.
381	00:25:58	00:26:00	Ten-minute rest stop, right back on the road.
382	00:26:00	00:26:02	Did you see a couple arguing?
383	00:26:02	00:26:04	No. But it was really busy.
384	00:26:43	00:26:44	Hey, Nick.
385	00:26:46	00:26:48	We making any progress?
386	00:26:48	00:26:50	Just this jacket so far.
387	00:26:50	00:26:52	Passenger seat. And you?
388	00:26:52	00:26:55	We checked Kevlin's property at the hospital.
389	00:26:55	00:26:56	There's no wallet.
390	00:26:56	00:27:01	Guy drives from L.A. four and a half hours-- I got an idea.
391	00:27:03	00:27:06	Hand me that, uh, crowbar there, please.
392	00:27:09	00:27:11	Thank you.
393	00:27:17	00:27:19	Ha.
394	00:27:19	00:27:20	Bingo.
395	00:27:23	00:27:25	I always take mine out.
396	00:27:25	00:27:26	Pain in the ass.
397	00:27:27	00:27:29	Literally.
398	00:27:29	00:27:31	Yeah, that's him.
399	00:27:31	00:27:34	Yeah.
400	00:27:35	00:27:38	Nice-looking girl.
401	00:27:38	00:27:40	Wait.
402	00:27:42	00:27:43	I've seen her.
403	00:27:45	00:27:49	Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her.
404	00:27:49	00:27:51	She was in the accident.
405	00:27:51	00:27:54	He said he wanted to surprise you.
406	00:27:56	00:27:58	He did.
407	00:27:58	00:28:00	In Barstow at the rest stop.
408	00:28:00	00:28:04	It was supposed to be a girls' weekend.
409	00:28:05	00:28:07	No! This is my weekend.
410	00:28:07	00:28:10	If this is going to work, I need my space.
411	00:28:10	00:28:12	I don't want to lose you.
412	00:28:12	00:28:13	Then go back home.
413	00:28:13	00:28:16	I saw him pull out.
414	00:28:16	00:28:18	Drive off.
415	00:28:18	00:28:21	Well, he didn't drive back to L.A.
416	00:28:21	00:28:24	I wish I hadn't yelled at him.
417	00:28:27	00:28:32	Is there any reason why Eric, in a medical crisis would refuse resuscitation?
418	00:28:32	00:28:34	What are you talking about?
419	00:28:34	00:28:38	He consented to lifesaving surgery, but...
420	00:28:38	00:28:40	signed a DNR.
421	00:28:41	00:28:43	Oh, God.
422	00:28:46	00:28:49	It's because he was a doctor.
423	00:28:49	00:28:51	He saw it every day.
424	00:28:51	00:28:55	People hooked up to machines waiting to die.
425	00:28:55	00:28:59	He swore he wouldn't let anyone he loved go through that.
426	00:28:59	00:29:05	And if his life was at stake he wanted to make the hard decision so no one else would have to.
427	00:29:40	00:29:44	I thought I told you I'd page you with the results.
428	00:29:44	00:29:46	I know. I want to wait.
429	00:29:52	00:29:54	Greg?
430	00:29:54	00:29:57	You're really good at what you do.
431	00:30:08	00:30:09	Sabotage.
432	00:30:22	00:30:24	Grissom.
433	00:30:24	00:30:26	I finally know the first action.
434	00:30:26	00:30:27	What initiated the skid.
435	00:30:27	00:30:30	The right front tire started to come apart.
436	00:30:30	00:30:33	When it blew, it left an indentation in the pavement.
437	00:30:35	00:30:36	I didn't see it.
438	00:30:36	00:30:38	You and me both.
439	00:30:38	00:30:40	Treads from the right rear tire obscured it.
440	00:30:44	00:30:49	So, the driver overcorrects but since there's no more tire all that force is displaced on the suspension system.
441	00:30:50	00:30:54	The bolt snaps, the rod arm breaks and the bus broadsides the Camaro.
442	00:30:56	00:31:01	But why did the tire come apart in the first place?
443	00:31:03	00:31:04	I don't know.
444	00:31:04	00:31:05	I do.
445	00:31:05	00:31:09	Chloroform. Inside the tire.
446	00:31:17	00:31:20	Newton's Third... with a twist.
447	00:31:21	00:31:23	Yeah, the front right tire was compromised.
448	00:31:23	00:31:26	I found chloroform in the interior fragments of the rubber.
449	00:31:26	00:31:28	Oh, that's original. What happened to slashing tires?
450	00:31:28	00:31:29	It wasn't vandalism.
451	00:31:29	00:31:31	It was an act of premeditation.
452	00:31:31	00:31:32	Why chloroform?
453	00:31:32	00:31:34	Chloroform destroys the elasticity of the rubber.
454	00:31:34	00:31:36	Sooner or later, the air pressure inside the tire causes it to explode.
455	00:31:36	00:31:37	How much later?
456	00:31:37	00:31:39	Well, that's what we're going to find out.
457	00:31:39	00:31:41	We need a treadmill-- a big one.
458	00:31:41	00:31:42	All right, to do what?
459	00:31:42	00:31:43	Exercise a bus.
460	00:31:43	00:31:47	Warrick, tell Larry Maddox it's in his best interest to lend us one of his.
461	00:31:47	00:31:50	Set it up in the empty police warehouse next door. Sara?
462	00:31:50	00:31:54	Yeah, I'll be at Trace. They're going to love this.
463	00:31:56	00:31:59	Chloroform in the tire?
464	00:31:59	00:32:03	Yeah. Weird, huh? So, where are we?
465	00:32:03	00:32:05	Body count jumped to nine dead.
466	00:32:05	00:32:08	Sabrina Wright law student, 7-B.
467	00:32:08	00:32:09	Pronounced an hour ago.
468	00:32:09	00:32:12	23 passengers, plus the driver.
469	00:32:12	00:32:16	Whoever tampered with that tire was playing Russian roulette with people's lives.
470	00:32:16	00:32:19	Or maybe one of them was a target.
471	00:32:19	00:32:22	Hmm.... Gwen Murray, 1-B...
472	00:32:22	00:32:26	was unemployed, but was clearing a bundle in alimony.
473	00:32:26	00:32:28	Also got the Porsche and the vacation home.
474	00:32:28	00:32:33	Michael Goodman, 10-C was picked up a couple times by vice for making fake IDs.
475	00:32:33	00:32:40	Ryan Hyde, a money manager in 4-C, filed bankruptcy last year but carried a hefty life insurance policy.
476	00:32:40	00:32:41	I mean, I could go on.
477	00:32:41	00:32:42	Right.
478	00:32:42	00:32:45	You look hard enough everybody's got a skeleton.
479	00:32:48	00:32:50	What was her skeleton?
480	00:32:50	00:32:52	Tracey Logan?
481	00:32:52	00:32:54	Seat 8-B?
482	00:32:54	00:32:57	Her boyfriend was Eric Kevlin the Camaro driver.
483	00:32:57	00:32:58	He was a doctor.
484	00:32:58	00:33:00	He followed her from L.A.
485	00:33:00	00:33:01	They had an argument in Barstow.
486	00:33:01	00:33:03	He didn't want her in Vegas.
487	00:33:03	00:33:06	First step to stopping her is stopping the bus.
488	00:33:06	00:33:08	And he has access to chloroform.
489	00:33:08	00:33:11	Chloroform can be picked up at any chemical supply store.
490	00:33:11	00:33:12	Wait a minute.
491	00:33:12	00:33:15	Eric Kevlin was a nervous boyfriend.
492	00:33:15	00:33:16	He wasn't a criminal.
493	00:33:16	00:33:21	Still possible. Motive, access, opportunity.
494	00:33:21	00:33:23	His car should be towed in by now.
495	00:33:23	00:33:27	I'll check for residue.
496	00:33:30	00:33:31	So, who do you like?
497	00:33:31	00:33:32	The bus company.
498	00:33:32	00:33:40	Larry Maddox-- he talks a good game but, uh, he cheaped out on his supplies and he's been way too helpful.
499	00:33:48	00:33:49	You busy?
500	00:33:49	00:33:52	I got three minutes and, uh, five seconds.
501	00:33:52	00:33:54	Then I have a question for you.
502	00:33:54	00:33:55	Bus case?
503	00:33:55	00:33:56	Uh-huh.
504	00:33:56	00:33:59	I heard Sanders broke out of here, fared poorly and disgraced us all.
505	00:34:00	00:34:02	No, he didn't.
506	00:34:03	00:34:10	Listen, I-I found chloroform on the inside of a steel-belted radial and I need to know how it got there.
507	00:34:10	00:34:13	You ever hear the expression pissing up a rope?
508	00:34:13	00:34:16	Not in a scientific context, no.
509	00:34:16	00:34:23	Well, I don't know if you can urinate up a rope but you can urinate against a rope and the urine will dribble down.
510	00:34:23	00:34:24	Answer your question?
511	00:34:24	00:34:27	Yes.
512	00:34:27	00:34:31	You know we need to document this for The Journal of Forensic Science, right?
513	00:34:33	00:34:34	Is this the twin?
514	00:34:34	00:34:37	Yeah, this is the rear trailing tire of the crash bus.
515	00:34:37	00:34:40	It has the same maintenance record as the tire that blew.
516	00:34:40	00:34:45	Chloroform, glass rod valve core remover....
517	00:34:45	00:34:49	According to Vincent and Trace it's like pissing down a rope.
518	00:34:49	00:34:51	Gravity, huh?
519	00:35:08	00:35:10	Reattach the valve...
520	00:35:15	00:35:17	reinflate the tire...
521	00:35:28	00:35:31	...and you're done.
522	00:35:31	00:35:35	Minute, minute and a half tops.
523	00:35:35	00:35:37	Did you see that?
524	00:35:37	00:35:39	Yeah.
525	00:35:39	00:35:41	You used your left hand to prop yourself up.
526	00:35:41	00:35:45	The perp may have done the same.
527	00:35:45	00:35:47	Yeah, I'm going to go dust that right rim.
528	00:35:47	00:35:48	I'll see you guys.
529	00:35:50	00:35:55	Okay. Drive, he said. Just the speed limit.
530	00:36:57	00:36:58	Warrick.
531	00:36:58	00:36:59	Okay.
532	00:36:59	00:37:02	Yeah, okay.
533	00:37:02	00:37:03	I'll be there.
534	00:37:05	00:37:08	Sara. She's at the print lab.
535	00:37:08	00:37:10	She needs me.
536	00:37:15	00:37:17	Checkmate.
537	00:37:29	00:37:33	Print off the rim matched a work card on file-- a Sean Nolan.
538	00:37:33	00:37:36	So, why are you paging me?
539	00:37:36	00:37:38	I pulled up his DMV records looking for an address.
540	00:37:38	00:37:40	I found one, not recent, but...
541	00:37:40	00:37:42	he's got a Class B license with passenger endorsement.
542	00:37:42	00:37:47	Oh... so he can drive a vehicle with over ten passengers.
543	00:37:47	00:37:50	I cross-checked his name with the employee roster from Mojave Express. Mm-hmm?
544	00:37:50	00:37:51	He's a driver.
545	00:37:53	00:37:59	Well, I guess I'll grab a uniform and pay Mr. Maddox another visit.
546	00:38:02	00:38:05	03 p.m.
547	00:38:05	00:38:07	target would be two hours later.
548	00:38:07	00:38:10	No, if the tire was tampered with in Barstow it should blow any minute.
549	00:38:10	00:38:12	If not, it was sabotaged in L.A.
550	00:38:13	00:38:14	and we've got another two hours and 13 minutes.
551	00:38:17	00:38:20	Hello.
552	00:38:33	00:38:35	Cool.
553	00:38:35	00:38:37	Well, I guess it's Barstow.
554	00:38:37	00:38:43	Listen I scanned Eric Kevlin's car and clothing with an ion detector.
555	00:38:43	00:38:45	There was no chloroform. He was clean.
556	00:38:45	00:38:49	And I got a hit off that print-- a Sean Nolan, employed by Mojave Express.
557	00:38:49	00:38:51	Any chance he was in Barstow yesterday?
558	00:38:52	00:38:57	Uh, his route is... Vegas/Grand Canyon but I'll call Warrick.
559	00:38:57	00:38:59	He's on his way to the bus company right now.
560	00:38:59	00:39:03	You know, if this guy Nolan worked for the bus company his print on the wheel could be legit.
561	00:39:04	00:39:10	Well, I wish we had a who but at least we have a where.
562	00:39:10	00:39:11	I have a zero tolerance policy.
563	00:39:11	00:39:14	I found marijuana in Mr. Nolan's locker.
564	00:39:14	00:39:16	He was out of here that afternoon.
565	00:39:16	00:39:18	Well, we're still going to need those maintenance records.
566	00:39:24	00:39:27	Everything from fill-ups to tune-ups the last six months.
567	00:39:27	00:39:29	Thank you.
568	00:39:32	00:39:36	There were security cameras behind the counter but none of them were pointed out here.
569	00:39:36	00:39:39	Five buses have pulled in in the last ten minutes.
570	00:39:39	00:39:43	Not to mention all the private vehicles truckers-- nothing's changed since I was here yesterday.
571	00:39:43	00:39:46	Forget about getting a usable print off that airhose.
572	00:39:46	00:39:50	Yeah, a guy putting air in a tire at a rest stop does not draw attention.
573	00:39:50	00:39:52	( cell phone rings) Grissom.
574	00:39:52	00:39:54	Sean Nolan was fired two months ago.
575	00:39:54	00:40:00	Maddox says he's working in Barstow and since then three of Maddox's buses had blowouts.
576	00:40:00	00:40:02	They all went through Barstow.
577	00:40:02	00:40:04	Did you check their maintenance records?
578	00:40:04	00:40:08	Yeah, only last night's bus had been serviced since Maddox changed suppliers.
579	00:40:08	00:40:10	Way to go, Warrick. I owe you.
580	00:40:10	00:40:11	Yeah, you do.
581	00:40:11	00:40:12	See you.
582	00:40:12	00:40:15	We got a suspect.
583	00:40:15	00:40:17	Sean Nolan.
584	00:40:26	00:40:29	Sean Nolan?
585	00:40:29	00:40:30	Can I help you?
586	00:40:30	00:40:33	Yeah, there was a bus crash up the road.
587	00:40:33	00:40:35	About nine people died.
588	00:40:35	00:40:37	Yeah, it's all over the news.
589	00:40:37	00:40:38	I already talked to him.
590	00:40:38	00:40:39	I forgot what you told me.
591	00:40:40	00:40:41	Wasn't much to tell.
592	00:40:41	00:40:43	Your prints were on the bus.
593	00:40:43	00:40:45	Not following.
594	00:40:45	00:40:47	Front right wheel hub.
595	00:40:47	00:40:48	I work here.
596	00:40:49	00:40:51	Julius Caesar, murdered in 44 B.C.
597	00:40:51	00:40:55	Legend has it that the molecules from his last breath spread all over the world.
598	00:40:55	00:40:58	Probably like your fingerprints, right?
599	00:40:58	00:40:59	They're everywhere.
600	00:40:59	00:41:00	Uh...
601	00:41:00	00:41:02	Mr. Nolan, have you handled any chloroform lately?
602	00:41:03	00:41:05	No.
603	00:41:05	00:41:07	You mind?
604	00:41:09	00:41:11	What are you doing?
605	00:41:11	00:41:12	Would you turn around, please?
606	00:41:18	00:41:19	Whoa.
607	00:41:20	00:41:22	Is that a pickle in your pocket or are you just happy to see us?
608	00:41:36	00:41:40	Just wanted to stick it to him. Give him a few problems.
609	00:41:40	00:41:42	Maddox?
610	00:41:42	00:41:45	Yeah.
611	00:41:47	00:41:50	I smoke one joint on the weekend... my time.
612	00:41:50	00:41:51	Now I got a jacket as a junkie.
613	00:41:53	00:41:56	Can't get a job driving a bus to save my life.
614	00:41:56	00:42:00	So, you figured, I'll just blow a couple of his tires.
615	00:42:00	00:42:04	Even if a tire blows the suspension system should keep the bus on the road.
616	00:42:04	00:42:07	I been driving buses for ten years.
617	00:42:07	00:42:09	I've never seen a flat take out a bus.
618	00:42:09	00:42:12	There's always a first time.
619	00:42:12	00:42:14	You're under arrest.
620	00:42:21	00:42:24	I didn't mean to hurt anyone, okay?
621	00:42:27	00:42:30	Well, I'd hate to be a juror on a case like this.
622	00:42:30	00:42:31	Second-degree murder.
623	00:42:31	00:42:37	Reckless disregard for safety and human life mitigated by bad bolts.
624	00:42:37	00:42:40	Yeah, which was mitigated by greed.
625	00:42:42	00:42:45	Folks, we're going to take a quick 15-minute pit stop.
626	00:42:45	00:42:47	We're about 45 minutes outside of Las Vegas.
