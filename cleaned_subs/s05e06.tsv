1	00:00:20	00:00:21	Omega Zeta Pi!
2	00:00:23	00:00:24	Say it loud and say it proud!
3	00:00:24	00:00:26	Omega Zeta Pi!
4	00:00:33	00:00:33	Dude...
5	00:00:34	00:00:36	what's crawling on my face?
6	00:00:36	00:00:39	It's Fraternity Hell Week.
7	00:00:39	00:00:42	A pledge slipped and fell in this pile of maggots.
8	00:00:42	00:00:48	School of Agriculture is in charge of campus landscaping, so Security called me.
9	00:00:48	00:00:50	You were the first person I thought of.
10	00:00:50	00:00:52	Well, thank you, Eva. I'm honored.
11	00:00:52	00:00:54	You make your own mulch?
12	00:00:54	00:00:56	The university is self-sustaining.
13	00:00:56	00:00:58	A city within a city.
14	00:00:58	00:01:01	State institutions are encouraged to practice Xeriscaping.
15	00:01:02	00:01:03	Xeri meaning dry?
16	00:01:03	00:01:06	Landscaping using drought-tolerant plant life.
17	00:01:06	00:01:07	Conserves water.
18	00:01:07	00:01:10	There's no reason for these maggots to be here.
19	00:01:10	00:01:13	Dr. Grissom, your tea. Hold the tea bag?
20	00:01:13	00:01:15	Thank you, Brian.
21	00:01:20	00:01:21	Do, uh...
22	00:01:21	00:01:25	do you use scraps from the dining halls for your compost?
23	00:01:25	00:01:26	No. Why?
24	00:01:27	00:01:35	Well, if the devil requires a pound of flesh, this many maggots would require over a hundred.
25	00:01:35	00:01:37	Pounds of flesh?
26	00:01:54	00:01:58	Were you aware that the average college student weighs 135 pounds?
27	00:02:37	00:02:39	How long is this going to take?
28	00:02:39	00:02:41	If something happened to one of our students, don't you want to know?
29	00:02:41	00:02:42	Sure.
30	00:02:43	00:02:49	But on a campus this size, there's a thin line between satisfying curiosity and creating panic.
31	00:02:49	00:02:53	This stopped being about my curiosity the minute we found a human tooth.
32	00:02:54	00:02:58	We're now investigating a possible homicide.
33	00:03:01	00:03:04	Hey, Grissom, why is it hot?
34	00:03:04	00:03:07	Maggot digestion can generate heat up to 125 degrees.
35	00:03:07	00:03:13	Heat increases the rate of putrefaction, which speeds up the digestive process.
36	00:03:14	00:03:15	I don't see any tissue.
37	00:03:15	00:03:18	How long would it take for them to pick a body clean?
38	00:03:18	00:03:20	Assuming it's just one body?
39	00:03:20	00:03:21	A few days.
40	00:03:21	00:03:22	Yeah, and that's another thing.
41	00:03:22	00:03:26	I have a hard time believing that if a corpse was here, no one saw it.
42	00:03:26	00:03:27	And these bones?
43	00:03:27	00:03:30	They're uniform.
44	00:03:30	00:03:32	Same shape and size.
45	00:03:32	00:03:35	Yeah.
46	00:03:37	00:03:39	Same size as these wood chips.
47	00:04:05	00:04:06	This thing always this loud?
48	00:04:07	00:04:09	Yeah, but we're, we're kind of off the beaten path.
49	00:04:10	00:04:11	You use it every day?
50	00:04:11	00:04:13	Pretty much.
51	00:04:17	00:04:19	You think a human body could fit through there?
52	00:04:20	00:04:21	You planning something?
53	00:04:21	00:04:23	Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
54	00:04:23	00:04:25	Walter Beerly, Master of the Universe.
55	00:04:25	00:04:27	Six cylinders.
56	00:04:27	00:04:29	200 horse power.
57	00:04:29	00:04:33	Thing's got an engine that would give most SUVs a run for their money.
58	00:04:33	00:04:34	And it's got one job.
59	00:04:34	00:04:36	Chopping crap up.
60	00:04:37	00:04:38	So the answer's yes.
61	00:04:42	00:04:44	Would take about 15 seconds.
62	00:04:44	00:04:45	May I?
63	00:04:45	00:04:47	You want to stick your head in there, be my guest.
64	00:04:51	00:04:52	What are you looking for?
65	00:04:52	00:04:54	Blood.
66	00:04:54	00:05:02	Oh, you're pretty much out of luck, 'cause I've been chipping all morning, and if there was any in there, it's probably gone.
67	00:05:02	00:05:05	See, wood absorbs moisture.
68	00:05:05	00:05:08	One of the reasons they use it for mulch.
69	00:05:17	00:05:18	Pregnant?
70	00:05:20	00:05:21	It's human.
71	00:05:34	00:05:36	Remember, you're on the clock, man.
72	00:05:36	00:05:42	About, uh, 24 hours... all of these maggots turn into flies.
73	00:06:05	00:06:07	What are you doing?
74	00:06:07	00:06:11	Day shift told me you didn't get any results off the tooth.
75	00:06:11	00:06:14	Yeah, it was a porcelain crown.
76	00:06:14	00:06:16	Root canal. No viable pulp.
77	00:06:16	00:06:18	I still need a DNA profile on our victim.
78	00:06:18	00:06:21	And since bone marrow extraction can be difficult...
79	00:06:21	00:06:24	I figured I'd go straight to the source.
80	00:06:24	00:06:27	Well, maggots are eating machines.
81	00:06:27	00:06:30	They'll have DNA from the flesh.
82	00:06:30	00:06:32	It's genius.
83	00:06:32	00:06:33	There you go.
84	00:06:33	00:06:36	One maggot colada, coming up.
85	00:06:46	00:06:48	What's with the tape?
86	00:06:48	00:06:51	The evidence wasn't cooperating, so I stuck it to them.
87	00:06:52	00:06:53	Cute.
88	00:06:55	00:06:57	Anything of interest?
89	00:06:57	00:06:59	Well, I haven't had much time for analysis.
90	00:06:59	00:07:06	So far the only inorganics are these black plastic shreds, from a garbage bag, I think, and...
91	00:07:06	00:07:07	this.
92	00:07:16	00:07:19	Well, blue trace is tacky.
93	00:07:22	00:07:25	It's a fingernail.
94	00:07:26	00:07:27	Uh, sorry, Sara.
95	00:07:27	00:07:28	I need the microscope. Priority.
96	00:07:28	00:07:30	I got three more samples to run.
97	00:07:30	00:07:31	When I'm done, it'll be your turn.
98	00:07:31	00:07:32	This can't wait.
99	00:07:32	00:07:33	It can't?
100	00:07:34	00:07:35	Or you can't?
101	00:07:35	00:07:36	Both.
102	00:07:36	00:07:38	Go have a cup of coffee on me.
103	00:07:42	00:07:43	The coffee's free.
104	00:07:43	00:07:45	Thank you.
105	00:08:21	00:08:25	Oil-based blue paint mixed with motor oil...
106	00:08:25	00:08:26	on a fingernail.
107	00:08:28	00:08:31	He's back.
108	00:08:31	00:08:35	Starting in 1987, a series of murders occurred on the WLVU campus.
109	00:08:36	00:08:38	Janet Kent...
110	00:08:38	00:08:40	Marcia Reese...
111	00:08:40	00:08:41	and Charlene Roth.
112	00:08:42	00:08:47	Now, Charlene Roth's murder provided us with enough evidence to investigate a suspect...
113	00:08:48	00:08:51	John Mathers, WLVU security guard.
114	00:08:51	00:08:54	He was arrested, tried and convicted.
115	00:08:54	00:08:57	Two years ago, this week, he was executed.
116	00:08:57	00:09:00	The night of his execution, Debby Reston was murdered.
117	00:09:00	00:09:01	Copycat, right?
118	00:09:01	00:09:02	No.
119	00:09:02	00:09:07	We believe that Mathers was the copycat, responsible only for Charlene Roth's death.
120	00:09:07	00:09:09	Which means the serial killer is still at large.
121	00:09:09	00:09:11	And we have reason to believe that he has killed again.
122	00:09:12	00:09:14	Our suspect's M.O.
123	00:09:14	00:09:21	is to apply blue paint to a campus railing that he has infused with motor oil to retard the drying process.
124	00:09:21	00:09:26	He then lays in wait for a female victim to touch the railing.
125	00:09:26	00:09:28	It's always near a water fountain.
126	00:09:28	00:09:33	He then grabs them from behind as they're washing the paint from their hands.
127	00:09:33	00:09:36	Our suspect's prior victims were all sexually assaulted.
128	00:09:37	00:09:38	No semen was found.
129	00:09:38	00:09:40	strangulation.
130	00:09:40	00:09:46	He stuffed them in black plastic trash bags and dumps the bodies in plain sight.
131	00:09:46	00:09:53	Given that he has been killing for around 20 years, we approximate his age to be at least 35.
132	00:09:53	00:09:54	He may wear glasses.
133	00:09:54	00:09:56	He may drive a Chevy with black interior.
134	00:09:56	00:09:58	The latest victim was put in a wood chipper.
135	00:09:59	00:10:00	Why the change in M.O.?
136	00:10:00	00:10:04	Serials have been known to change their signatures because they have to.
137	00:10:04	00:10:06	Fear of being caught...
138	00:10:06	00:10:10	interruption... or it could just be an act of escalation.
139	00:10:10	00:10:14	So we're looking for a sadistic, ritualistic, organized sociopath.
140	00:10:15	00:10:16	We'll be on 12 and 12s.
141	00:10:16	00:10:19	No holidays, no vacations until this is solved.
142	00:10:23	00:10:26	Ms. Willows, can you confirm that the Blue Paint Killer has claimed another victim?
143	00:10:27	00:10:28	I haven't been cleared for comment.
144	00:10:28	00:10:31	Ms. Willows, was John Mathers wrongfully convicted?
145	00:10:31	00:10:34	Did the State execute an innocent man?
146	00:10:34	00:10:39	John Mathers killed Charlene Roth and was punished for it.
147	00:10:39	00:10:41	Well, how can you be so sure of that?
148	00:10:41	00:10:43	I double-checked the results.
149	00:10:43	00:10:44	The DNA from the maggots is male.
150	00:10:44	00:10:46	Any possible cross-contamination?
151	00:10:46	00:10:49	No, the samples were pure.
152	00:10:49	00:10:51	Griss, this place is crawling with press.
153	00:10:51	00:10:52	They want a statement.
154	00:10:52	00:10:55	Not now. Well, if you don't say anything, they're just going to fill in the blanks...
155	00:10:55	00:11:01	Screw the press, 'cause for all I know, the dead body is an auto mechanic who just painted his house blue.
156	00:11:19	00:11:22	What's this key used for?
157	00:11:22	00:11:25	Um, pledging. Plebes are asked to swallow it on the first night of Hell Week.
158	00:11:25	00:11:27	Then retrieve it and return it by the end of the week, right?
159	00:11:27	00:11:28	You got it.
160	00:11:29	00:11:30	You know that hazing is illegal.
161	00:11:30	00:11:31	You could lose your charter.
162	00:11:31	00:11:35	Well, it's not hazing. It's a voluntary loyalty ritual.
163	00:11:35	00:11:37	Political science major?
164	00:11:37	00:11:38	Pre-law. ! Good.
165	00:11:38	00:11:42	Maybe you can explain why the pledge who swallowed this key ended up dead.
166	00:11:42	00:11:45	Wha-What're you talking about?
167	00:11:45	00:11:49	Has anyone from Omega Zeta Pi dropped out or gone missing?
168	00:11:55	00:11:57	Uh...
169	00:12:00	00:12:03	Yeah, Jo-Jonathan Avery Haywood III.
170	00:12:03	00:12:06	Johnny. Oh, kid was a shoe-in.
171	00:12:06	00:12:07	Dad was a member. Granddad was a member.
172	00:12:07	00:12:10	But we haven't seen Johnny since Pledge Week.
173	00:12:10	00:12:14	So, he's been missing for days, yet you didn't bother to call anyone?
174	00:12:14	00:12:16	For all I knew he was getting laid.
175	00:12:16	00:12:19	Look, I'm the fraternity president, not his mother.
176	00:12:19	00:12:21	We're gonna need his toothbrush and his hairbrush.
177	00:12:21	00:12:23	Get off of me! Button!
178	00:12:23	00:12:25	I'm a loser. I'm a loser. I'm a loser.
179	00:12:32	00:12:35	Why didn't Nick find this before?
180	00:12:35	00:12:39	'Cause he was working from a schematic the campus security gave him.
181	00:12:39	00:12:41	The railing's not on it.
182	00:12:52	00:12:54	This cement is fresh.
183	00:12:57	00:13:01	So, now he's not just painting railings; he's installing them.
184	00:13:01	00:13:05	We're going to need to dig this up, cement and all.
185	00:13:19	00:13:22	Get Brass. We have another body.
186	00:13:47	00:13:51	So, he knew we would find this.
187	00:13:52	00:13:55	And now he's taunting us.
188	00:15:17	00:15:25	Two years ago, DNA confirmed a hair found on Debby Reston belonged to the serial's first victim, Janet Kent.
189	00:15:27	00:15:29	Planted hairs.
190	00:15:29	00:15:32	It's part of his signature.
191	00:16:03	00:16:08	Well, DNA confirmed that the hair found in the doll's mouth belonged to Debby Reston.
192	00:16:08	00:16:13	I tested the note with ESDA, because I saw some indentations in the paper.
193	00:16:13	00:16:17	He must've written I have her on the underlying page.
194	00:16:17	00:16:23	Prior evidence indicated that the suspect was an artist or had some connection to the university's Art Department.
195	00:16:23	00:16:26	Serials typically photograph their crime scenes.
196	00:16:26	00:16:27	If we're dealing with an artist here...
197	00:16:28	00:16:30	maybe he drew his victims instead.
198	00:16:30	00:16:32	Looks like she's in a small room.
199	00:16:32	00:16:34	What is that in the foreground?
200	00:16:34	00:16:36	Chair? Sofa?
201	00:16:36	00:16:38	What about behind her?
202	00:16:38	00:16:39	Windows, maybe.
203	00:16:40	00:16:41	Can we blow that up?
204	00:16:45	00:16:47	Some kind of signage?
205	00:16:47	00:16:50	And the lettering's backwards.
206	00:16:50	00:16:52	Cramped space.
207	00:16:52	00:16:54	Chairs in the foreground, but no other furniture.
208	00:16:54	00:16:56	No shutters or curtains on the windows.
209	00:16:59	00:17:02	Maybe it's not a room. Maybe it's a... vehicle.
210	00:17:02	00:17:06	He was in the front seat, and he was looking at her through the rearview mirror.
211	00:17:12	00:17:21	So, he can attack her, abduct her, rape her and strangle her, but he can't look directly at her?
212	00:17:21	00:17:27	Guys, those black trilobal fibers that we found on Debby Reston's body were from a Chevy.
213	00:17:27	00:17:34	And the size and shape of those windows are consistent with a Chevy van.
214	00:17:42	00:17:44	I recognize the signage.
215	00:17:44	00:17:47	The Erotica Boutique on Tropicana.
216	00:17:50	00:17:53	It's distinctive...
217	00:17:53	00:17:55	The font...
218	00:18:10	00:18:12	Okay, break it open.
219	00:18:31	00:18:33	So, this is where he brought them.
220	00:18:38	00:18:41	The pump was probably for the doll.
221	00:18:41	00:18:43	Beer bottles...
222	00:18:43	00:18:48	Tell Mia to check them for saliva, as well as other bodily fluids.
223	00:18:48	00:18:52	You're thinking she was raped with a foreign object...
224	00:18:52	00:18:54	may be why we never found semen.
225	00:18:55	00:18:58	The police presence on the campus probably interrupted his plans for her disposal.
226	00:18:58	00:19:00	I'll take the girl.
227	00:19:00	00:19:01	I'll take the van.
228	00:19:29	00:19:30	Huh.
229	00:19:30	00:19:32	I would've picked you for a leather guy.
230	00:19:34	00:19:40	Has anyone, uh, bought one of these Coed Cheerleader Dolls in the last few days?
231	00:19:40	00:19:44	Most popular models are the latex love-'em-or-leave-'em cheapies for bachelor parties.
232	00:19:44	00:19:47	But in the midrange, Chrissy's not a bad choice.
233	00:19:47	00:19:52	Well, I'm more interested in the clientele than the merchandise.
234	00:19:52	00:19:53	Oh.
235	00:19:54	00:19:56	I'd like to take a look at your credit card receipts.
236	00:20:00	00:20:03	Surveillance?
237	00:20:03	00:20:04	Bad for business.
238	00:20:21	00:20:23	You know this artist?
239	00:20:23	00:20:26	Yeah, that is Zippy Tee.
240	00:20:26	00:20:27	You have an address for him?
241	00:20:27	00:20:28	Dude, I don't know where he lives.
242	00:20:28	00:20:29	How do you pay him?
243	00:20:29	00:20:31	It's not the Louvre.
244	00:20:31	00:20:33	It's the Love Boutique.
245	00:20:33	00:20:35	Local guys get store credit.
246	00:20:35	00:20:38	Has he ever traded for... a doll?
247	00:20:38	00:20:40	Yeah.
248	00:20:40	00:20:42	Can you describe him for me?
249	00:20:42	00:20:44	White guy. Brown hair.
250	00:20:44	00:20:48	Little shorter than you. 40, maybe 45...
251	00:20:48	00:20:50	Average looking. Average looking.
252	00:20:54	00:20:57	This all looks eerily familiar.
253	00:20:57	00:20:59	Blue paint on the hand.
254	00:20:59	00:21:02	Physical signs of sexual assault.
255	00:21:02	00:21:05	Ligature marks around the neck.
256	00:21:05	00:21:08	Prints turn up anything?
257	00:21:08	00:21:09	She's still a Jane Doe.
258	00:21:09	00:21:10	Height and weight?
259	00:21:10	00:21:11	Five-eight.
260	00:21:12	00:21:13	131 pounds.
261	00:21:13	00:21:15	Can you take down her hair?
262	00:21:15	00:21:16	Sure.
263	00:21:21	00:21:23	Pretty.
264	00:21:39	00:21:41	Pretty boy.
265	00:21:42	00:21:44	Definite similarity.
266	00:21:44	00:21:45	None of the other victims looked alike.
267	00:21:45	00:21:47	So, why these two?
268	00:21:47	00:21:48	Maybe he was a mistake.
269	00:21:48	00:21:50	Mistaken for a girl?
270	00:21:50	00:21:54	But not just any girl.
271	00:21:54	00:21:56	This girl.
272	00:21:59	00:22:02	We thought he selected his victims at random.
273	00:22:03	00:22:04	He didn't.
274	00:22:04	00:22:07	He chose her.
275	00:22:07	00:22:08	He hunted her.
276	00:22:08	00:22:10	And trapped her.
277	00:22:12	00:22:15	The TV said you were looking for information on Kaitlin Rackish.
278	00:22:15	00:22:18	When was the last time you saw Kaitlin?
279	00:22:18	00:22:25	Monday, but I've been pledging, so I haven't slept in the dorm the last couple nights.
280	00:22:25	00:22:30	I just thought I kept missing her.
281	00:22:30	00:22:32	Can you tell me what the two of you did on Monday?
282	00:22:32	00:22:33	All the details.
283	00:22:34	00:22:40	We went to the gym. Showered.
284	00:22:40	00:22:42	Went to the dining hall.
285	00:22:42	00:22:44	Monday's mac-n-cheese day.
286	00:22:44	00:22:46	It's Katy's favorite.
287	00:22:46	00:22:53	We picked up our orders at the Campus Copy Union-- term papers.
288	00:22:53	00:22:58	We bought sodas at the bookstore.
289	00:22:58	00:23:02	We went to the library to study.
290	00:23:02	00:23:10	A couple guys from Zeta Beta Theta were at the same table, so we didn't get that much done.
291	00:23:10	00:23:13	00 class.
292	00:23:13	00:23:15	What class is that?
293	00:23:18	00:23:20	Monday's, um...
294	00:23:20	00:23:24	Introduction to the Female Form with Professor Lewis.
295	00:23:24	00:23:28	Cody Lewis?
296	00:23:28	00:23:32	He got me interested in art.
297	00:23:32	00:23:35	Introduction to the Female Form?
298	00:23:35	00:23:40	Well, that's deep. That's really deep.
299	00:23:40	00:23:43	I bet that brings in all the 17-year-old pre-feminists.
300	00:23:43	00:23:45	This isn't mine.
301	00:23:45	00:23:47	Technique isn't bad, but it's raw.
302	00:23:47	00:23:49	This person hasn't had any formal training at all.
303	00:23:49	00:23:51	Well, maybe it's your alter ego.
304	00:23:51	00:23:53	You know, your bad-boy side; the Mr. Hyde thing.
305	00:23:53	00:23:56	You know, I came in voluntarily. You see, I want to help you.
306	00:23:56	00:23:58	But this is borderlining on harassment.
307	00:23:58	00:24:02	Look, I'm trying to tie together some loose ends, so help me out, all right? I appreciate your help. I do.
308	00:24:02	00:24:04	You got rid of your Chevy van.
309	00:24:04	00:24:05	You got yourself a wife.
310	00:24:05	00:24:07	Does she know you dated the first victim?
311	00:24:07	00:24:11	Your return to the campus coincided with the murder of the fourth victim?
312	00:24:11	00:24:14	And Kaitlin Rackish was in your evening classes?
313	00:24:14	00:24:15	You see what I got?
314	00:24:15	00:24:16	No, I don't.
315	00:24:16	00:24:19	Your buddy Mathers didn't talk much, either, and look what happened to him.
316	00:24:19	00:24:21	He's at the wrong end of a cold needle.
317	00:24:21	00:24:26	You know what it's like to be told you lead the life and fit the profile of a serial killer?
318	00:24:26	00:24:27	No. I wouldn't have a clue.
319	00:24:27	00:24:31	You see, you make all these assumptions, and you're not asking questions here.
320	00:24:31	00:24:34	You're attacking me to see how I react to what you say.
321	00:24:34	00:24:36	Nothing I say is going to make a difference with you.
322	00:24:36	00:24:37	So what's the point?
323	00:24:37	00:24:40	Why don't you just confess?
324	00:24:42	00:24:44	That's my point.
325	00:24:44	00:24:47	I didn't do it.
326	00:24:55	00:24:57	WLVU parking pass.
327	00:24:57	00:25:01	Connection to the campus. 1986.
328	00:25:02	00:25:03	This guy's been doing this a long time.
329	00:25:03	00:25:07	Two years ago, Debby Reston broke her killer's glasses.
330	00:25:09	00:25:10	They were 20/80.
331	00:25:10	00:25:12	I'll run 'em. See if they're the same.
332	00:25:14	00:25:17	VIN's been obliterated.
333	00:25:17	00:25:19	You better go ahead and run that parking pass.
334	00:25:21	00:25:23	Plate's expired.
335	00:25:23	00:25:25	Registration sticker's a phoney.
336	00:25:25	00:25:26	How do you know?
337	00:25:26	00:25:29	Check out the serial number.
338	00:25:29	00:25:34	0-0-0-0... Yeah, got it. Homemade.
339	00:25:55	00:25:58	Hey, did you spill print powder in the back of the van? No.
340	00:25:58	00:26:00	No, I superglued. Why?
341	00:26:00	00:26:03	May have found something.
342	00:26:03	00:26:06	Anything from the prints off the van?
343	00:26:06	00:26:15	Prints from the dash and the rearview mirror were a match to the partial that we got off the trash bag Debby Reston was found in two years ago.
344	00:26:15	00:26:17	Same guy, but still no hits from AFIS.
345	00:26:20	00:26:22	Are the X-rated comic books ready?
346	00:26:22	00:26:25	Nothing comical about them. Look at this.
347	00:26:25	00:26:30	Double-D cups, tiny waists, bondage.
348	00:26:30	00:26:31	Dehumanization.
349	00:26:31	00:26:39	I'm all for visual stimulation, but these images are about domination, not sex.
350	00:26:39	00:26:43	This artist gets off on dominating women.
351	00:26:43	00:26:45	This is his sex.
352	00:26:48	00:26:52	Janet and Marcia both lived in Dakin Hall.
353	00:26:52	00:26:55	Charlene and Debby took Econ 101.
354	00:26:55	00:26:59	Marcia and Charlene took English Lit.
355	00:26:59	00:27:04	Janet, Debby and Kaitlin all ate at Macgraw Dining Hall.
356	00:27:04	00:27:05	Janet dated Cody Lewis.
357	00:27:05	00:27:08	Kaitlin took his art class.
358	00:27:08	00:27:12	All right, so, uh, There's not one single thing that all five women have in common.
359	00:27:12	00:27:14	Right.
360	00:27:48	00:27:49	Please, help.
361	00:28:22	00:28:25	Dead plates.
362	00:28:25	00:28:28	Tampered VIN. Registration stickers are counterfeit.
363	00:28:28	00:28:29	Killer did a good job, though.
364	00:28:30	00:28:33	He used the right color, changed them every year, but no serial numbers.
365	00:28:33	00:28:35	So, we still don't know who owns the van.
366	00:28:35	00:28:38	Well, Greg did find this in the glove box.
367	00:28:38	00:28:39	It's from 1986.
368	00:28:39	00:28:41	So I called School Administration.
369	00:28:41	00:28:43	It's parking spot 324.
370	00:28:43	00:28:48	Not a student, but an employee executed two years ago.
371	00:28:48	00:28:49	John Mathers?
372	00:28:49	00:28:51	Yep. Ran Mathers through the DMV.
373	00:28:51	00:28:54	The partial VIN number on our van's a match.
374	00:28:54	00:28:57	So, our killer was driving around in Mathers' old van.
375	00:28:57	00:29:01	I don't think these two guys are an original and a copycat.
376	00:29:03	00:29:05	They were partners.
377	00:29:09	00:29:11	I don't deserve to die.
378	00:29:13	00:29:15	You think killing me will solve anything?
379	00:29:15	00:29:20	I've prepared myself, but I'm not ready.
380	00:29:20	00:29:22	This the John Mathers interview?
381	00:29:22	00:29:23	Week before he was executed.
382	00:29:23	00:29:29	Charlene Roth's mother testified at the Allocution that your death would mean her closure.
383	00:29:29	00:29:30	Not if you kill the wrong man.
384	00:29:31	00:29:34	Forensic evidence testified to at your trial says that you're guilty.
385	00:29:34	00:29:35	Forensic evidence changes all the time.
386	00:29:35	00:29:37	One day I'm innocent, the next day I'm not.
387	00:29:37	00:29:39	Is there anything in his prison file?
388	00:29:39	00:29:43	All those years on death row he only had one visitor, his lawyer.
389	00:29:43	00:29:46	Although he did receive a far amount of letters from random women...
390	00:29:47	00:29:51	if he was in communication with his partner, nothing in the file shows it.
391	00:29:51	00:29:53	You've been in prison for 15 years.
392	00:29:53	00:29:56	During that time the murders stopped.
393	00:29:56	00:29:59	What does that prove?
394	00:30:00	00:30:01	The real killer's smart.
395	00:30:01	00:30:04	Watches the news, he reads the papers just like you.
396	00:30:05	00:30:08	I'm... Man, I'm the perfect patsy.
397	00:30:08	00:30:09	So you maintain your innocence?
398	00:30:09	00:30:10	Absolutely.
399	00:30:10	00:30:12	I worked Campus Security.
400	00:30:12	00:30:17	I'm not the smartest or the richest guy, but do I look like I had problems with women?
401	00:30:19	00:30:20	I'm not the killer.
402	00:30:23	00:30:26	Remember that when I'm gone.
403	00:30:27	00:30:36	Well, the prints on the comb bindings from the comic books are a match to the prints recovered from the van and the garbage bag that Debby Reston was in.
404	00:30:36	00:30:38	Did you analyze the comics?
405	00:30:38	00:30:42	Yeah, and the drawings indicate a dominant, disassociative sexual sadist.
406	00:30:42	00:30:47	Prison shrink diagnosed Mathers as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder.
407	00:30:47	00:30:51	Which means he was pre-disposed to violent crimes but he might have needed some encouragement.
408	00:30:51	00:30:56	Well, to invite someone to join you for torture and murder would require a great deal of trust.
409	00:30:56	00:31:00	You would only do it if you knew you could completely control your partner.
410	00:31:00	00:31:02	Mathers was the submissive.
411	00:31:02	00:31:05	His partner is the alpha male.
412	00:31:05	00:31:08	Sexual sadism can go hand in hand with sexual dysfunction.
413	00:31:08	00:31:15	Mathers said that he wasn't the killer, but we confirmed that he had sex with Charlene Roth, based on the fact that we found his pubic hairs on her body.
414	00:31:15	00:31:21	Mia was looking for saliva on the beer bottles from the van and found a vaginal contribution on the neck of one of them.
415	00:31:21	00:31:24	Maybe Mathers was this guy's surrogate penis.
416	00:31:24	00:31:34	Okay, the partner kills on the eve of Mathers' execution, and again this week, on the second anniversary.
417	00:31:34	00:31:36	Why the no-show last year?
418	00:31:36	00:31:38	Maybe life got in the way.
419	00:31:38	00:31:41	Nick, that black powder from the back of the van is ink.
420	00:31:41	00:31:44	A toner made exclusively for commercial copy machines.
421	00:31:44	00:31:45	OCE 3600.
422	00:31:46	00:31:47	Okay. Thanks, Hodges.
423	00:31:50	00:31:58	The most recent victim went to the Campus Copy Union with her roommate on the day she disappeared.
424	00:31:58	00:31:59	Janet Kent's...
425	00:32:03	00:32:08	pocket contents-- a receipt from WLVU Copy Union.
426	00:32:08	00:32:12	On Debby Reston's backseat...
427	00:32:14	00:32:16	catalogs with comb bindings.
428	00:32:19	00:32:20	Who'd you find?
429	00:32:21	00:32:23	Kevin Greer. Works at the Copy Union.
430	00:32:23	00:32:26	Only employee who's been there over ten years; since 1983.
431	00:32:26	00:32:28	Fits our profile.
432	00:32:28	00:32:29	Where's Kevin Greer?
433	00:32:29	00:32:30	00.
434	00:32:31	00:32:32	Time for evening classes to let out.
435	00:32:32	00:32:33	What's going on?
436	00:32:33	00:32:35	Look, we'd like to talk to Kevin Greer.
437	00:32:35	00:32:36	You have any idea where he is?
438	00:32:36	00:32:37	No. We don't hang out.
439	00:32:37	00:32:38	How many people work here?
440	00:32:38	00:32:39	Just me.
441	00:32:39	00:32:40	Okay, we need to look around.
442	00:32:41	00:32:42	Okay.
443	00:32:52	00:32:54	Black plastic trash bags with toner powder.
444	00:32:54	00:32:56	Excuse me.
445	00:32:56	00:32:59	Does Kevin Greer use this machine for any of his personal projects?
446	00:32:59	00:33:01	Yeah. He binds his comic books.
447	00:33:13	00:33:16	Kevin Greer, Las Vegas Police.
448	00:33:16	00:33:17	Hit it.
449	00:33:28	00:33:29	Clear.
450	00:33:33	00:33:34	Check its noice.
451	00:33:34	00:33:36	Clear.
452	00:33:59	00:34:00	A paint mixer.
453	00:34:00	00:34:03	WLVU Blue.
454	00:34:03	00:34:08	So he mixed his own paint so we couldn't trace the origin of his purchase.
455	00:34:12	00:34:14	Las Vegas's finest.
456	00:34:14	00:34:16	Nice job.
457	00:34:16	00:34:17	Impressive turnout.
458	00:34:17	00:34:19	Have a look around.
459	00:34:19	00:34:24	I'll be here at the station waiting for you.
460	00:34:29	00:34:32	Gil, Jim.
461	00:34:37	00:34:40	If you made it to my house, you deserved to meet me.
462	00:34:43	00:34:47	I mean, how much time did you guys spend picturing the size of my hands?
463	00:34:50	00:34:53	Not very big.
464	00:34:53	00:34:56	You don't need big hands, though, not the way I do it.
465	00:34:56	00:35:01	Just... just a little at a time.
466	00:35:04	00:35:07	Take life, give it back.
467	00:35:07	00:35:09	God-like.
468	00:35:09	00:35:11	God-like?
469	00:35:13	00:35:14	No.
470	00:35:17	00:35:29	But there must be something angelic in the way I look, because even on their last breath, they didn't think I'd actually do it.
471	00:35:30	00:35:33	Am I disappointing you guys?
472	00:35:33	00:35:37	I mean, are you looking at me, wishing I was...
473	00:35:37	00:35:39	scarier?
474	00:35:39	00:35:42	No.
475	00:35:42	00:35:47	I was, uh, wondering what happened to your glasses.
476	00:35:50	00:35:53	Stupid Lasik.
477	00:35:53	00:35:54	It's what got me caught.
478	00:35:55	00:35:57	Is it?
479	00:35:57	00:35:59	When that Debby bitch busted my glasses...
480	00:36:00	00:36:03	I decided they were a liability.
481	00:36:05	00:36:07	But the procedure didn't take.
482	00:36:07	00:36:11	Is that why you missed last year's anniversary?
483	00:36:11	00:36:14	And my night vision still sucks.
484	00:36:17	00:36:19	Johnny?
485	00:36:25	00:36:27	I don't want to talk about him.
486	00:36:27	00:36:32	Well, you, uh, kept him for several days before you chopped him up.
487	00:36:32	00:36:34	Were you having a good time?
488	00:36:39	00:36:42	I'm not into boys.
489	00:36:44	00:36:46	Kid was in my freezer.
490	00:37:00	00:37:02	Wait a minute.
491	00:37:05	00:37:07	There are six here.
492	00:37:07	00:37:09	We only know of five.
493	00:37:16	00:37:19	Tell us about Charlene Roth.
494	00:37:20	00:37:22	You had to bring her up.
495	00:37:22	00:37:27	You know, I tried to talk him out of it, but, uh, J.M wouldn't...
496	00:37:27	00:37:29	John Mathers.
497	00:37:31	00:37:34	He had something to prove.
498	00:37:34	00:37:39	See, he didn't understand that we were better together than we would ever be apart.
499	00:37:42	00:37:44	He needed me.
500	00:37:44	00:37:46	Soul mates.
501	00:37:46	00:37:50	Contrary to popular belief, even people like us have souls.
502	00:37:53	00:38:04	I spent 15 years looking for a solid replacement, but you only get that lucky once in a lifetime.
503	00:38:04	00:38:05	You miss him.
504	00:38:05	00:38:07	I created him.
505	00:38:07	00:38:09	But you let him take the fall.
506	00:38:09	00:38:10	He got caught.
507	00:38:10	00:38:13	That's the price you pay for incompetence.
508	00:38:13	00:38:14	Death.
509	00:38:14	00:38:17	That's what you deserve when you make a mistake.
510	00:38:27	00:38:29	There's a sixth victim.
511	00:38:29	00:38:30	A Brit or Brittany Mosscoe.
512	00:38:30	00:38:32	Her name was on a Ziploc bag in Greer's freezer.
513	00:38:32	00:38:33	It contained a lock of hair.
514	00:38:33	00:38:35	Sara's looking into Missing Persons.
515	00:38:35	00:38:38	And Mia's running it through DNA.
516	00:38:38	00:38:40	Thanks.
517	00:38:49	00:38:51	Where is, uh...
518	00:38:53	00:38:55	Brit Mosscoe?
519	00:39:01	00:39:04	There's a lot of fight in her.
520	00:39:06	00:39:09	Is she old or new?
521	00:39:14	00:39:17	I'll take you to her.
522	00:39:19	00:39:23	Oh, we'll need a full tank of gas.
523	00:39:35	00:39:36	Hello.
524	00:39:36	00:39:45	Yeah, I'm trying to confirm that you have no record of a Brit Mosscoe attending WLVU in the last 18 years.
525	00:39:45	00:39:49	What about a night student?
526	00:39:49	00:39:51	Okay, thanks.
527	00:40:24	00:40:30	Hey, uh, can I go to the bathroom before we go?
528	00:40:30	00:40:33	Yeah, okay.
529	00:40:37	00:40:40	Bobbie, pat him down.
530	00:41:18	00:41:19	Slow down.
531	00:41:21	00:41:22	Okay...
532	00:41:24	00:41:25	Okay.
533	00:41:26	00:41:27	I got it.
534	00:41:29	00:41:30	The sixth victim is a ruse.
535	00:41:31	00:41:32	He drew her off a calendar.
536	00:41:32	00:41:36	Brit Mosscoe is an anagram for Miss October.
537	00:41:38	00:41:40	So where's he taking us?
538	00:41:40	00:41:42	Mr. Greer, let's go. Come on.
539	00:41:42	00:41:43	Mr. Greer?
540	00:41:44	00:41:45	Where is he, in there?
541	00:41:45	00:41:48	Come on, Mr. Greer, let's go!
542	00:41:49	00:41:50	Damn it!
543	00:41:58	00:41:59	Get a paramedic!
