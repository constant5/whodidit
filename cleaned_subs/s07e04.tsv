0	00:00:24	00:00:26	Hola, Cariño.
1	00:00:27	00:00:29	¿Todo bien?
2	00:00:29	00:00:33	Estan mis bebes durmiendo como bebes?
3	00:00:33	00:00:35	Sí, ya se, ya se.
4	00:00:35	00:00:38	No me reganes mas.
5	00:00:38	00:00:41	Sí, sí. Comida para el bebe.
6	00:00:41	00:00:43	Sí, pan, leche.
7	00:00:43	00:00:46	Mira, Cariño, ahorita vengo.
8	00:00:46	00:00:47	Te quiero.
9	00:01:46	00:01:48	The vic had nothing on him but his casino I.D.
10	00:01:48	00:01:49	Name is Vasco Ruiz.
11	00:01:49	00:01:53	He's a dishwasher here at the Golden Sapphire.
12	00:01:54	00:01:58	Yeah, I guess he got off his shift, went to his car, got whacked.
13	00:01:59	00:02:00	By what?
14	00:02:00	00:02:01	A blender?
15	00:02:04	00:02:05	Surveillance?
16	00:02:05	00:02:07	Not in the employee structure.
17	00:02:07	00:02:08	Witnesses?
18	00:02:09	00:02:13	Well, we found a Wayne Newton impersonator, but all I could get him to do was sing a few bars of Danke Sheon.
19	00:02:13	00:02:19	But no wallet no cash, no cell phone, no car keys.
20	00:02:19	00:02:20	Smells like a robbery.
21	00:02:20	00:02:22	Maybe it was his payday.
22	00:02:22	00:02:26	Even if this guy was walking out of here with a million dollars...
23	00:02:26	00:02:27	this is way more than excessive.
24	00:02:27	00:02:28	Personal.
25	00:02:28	00:02:31	Yeah, I'm gonna go get personal with his boss.
26	00:02:31	00:02:33	See what he knows.
27	00:05:07	00:05:09	You got a name?
28	00:05:09	00:05:10	She's not talking.
29	00:05:10	00:05:11	What about ID?
30	00:05:11	00:05:13	He must've taken her wallet.
31	00:05:13	00:05:14	Cell phone?
32	00:05:14	00:05:15	It's not here, they took it.
33	00:05:15	00:05:18	Somebody had to see something.
34	00:05:18	00:05:19	Hey. Hi.
35	00:05:19	00:05:24	Well, we got a souvenir cup that screams tourist.
36	00:05:24	00:05:26	Yep.
37	00:05:26	00:05:28	I don't see a bar anywhere around here.
38	00:05:28	00:05:30	She must've been either going to or coming from the Strip.
39	00:05:30	00:05:34	But she shouldn't have been walking around here, Warrick.
40	00:05:34	00:05:36	Couldn't pick a shadier part of town, man.
41	00:05:36	00:05:42	You know these tourists don't know what they're getting when they book a trip to Vegas online.
42	00:05:42	00:05:44	They think I got a room on the Strip for 75 bucks.
43	00:05:44	00:05:46	Whoo, what a deal.
44	00:05:46	00:05:49	Then they mosey through the naked city with their thousand dollar cameras.
45	00:05:49	00:05:53	Next thing you know, we're taking their picture.
46	00:05:53	00:05:57	You know what, Grissom's crime scene is just five blocks from here.
47	00:05:57	00:06:00	Both victims had their wallets and their cell phones stolen.
48	00:06:00	00:06:03	And they were both beaten down in the same way.
49	00:06:03	00:06:06	Looks like someone's on a little crime spree.
50	00:06:15	00:06:17	Uh, David, hang on.
51	00:06:24	00:06:26	Looks like a woman's toenail.
52	00:06:27	00:06:30	Well, it's not necessarily a woman's.
53	00:07:00	00:07:02	Jessica...
54	00:07:02	00:07:07	this might hurt a little bit, but it's going to help us get the people who did this to you.
55	00:07:09	00:07:11	I'm sorry.
56	00:07:11	00:07:13	Thank you.
57	00:07:19	00:07:21	Do you have any other injuries?
58	00:07:21	00:07:24	Yeah. On my left side.
59	00:07:24	00:07:25	Ow.
60	00:07:29	00:07:33	Could you lift your left arm for me, please?
61	00:07:41	00:07:43	Thank you.
62	00:07:46	00:07:49	I just got out of a ten-year relationship.
63	00:07:49	00:07:52	So I decided to take a solo trip to Vegas.
64	00:07:52	00:07:57	You know, try the whole what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
65	00:07:57	00:07:59	Been there.
66	00:07:59	00:08:02	Yeah, well, I get to take this face back with me.
67	00:08:06	00:08:09	Well, did anybody else get hurt?
68	00:08:10	00:08:11	Why do you ask?
69	00:08:11	00:08:15	I heard them say that I was number two.
70	00:08:15	00:08:18	Was there a number one?
71	00:08:18	00:08:19	There was.
72	00:08:19	00:08:21	How are they doing?
73	00:08:23	00:08:24	He died.
74	00:08:58	00:09:01	All right, slick.
75	00:09:01	00:09:03	Now what's with the suit?
76	00:09:03	00:09:04	Today was my first jury trial.
77	00:09:04	00:09:09	Today ended an hour and a half ago.
78	00:09:09	00:09:12	Well, maybe I just don't want the day to end.
79	00:09:12	00:09:17	Well, if that's the case, why don't you help my day end quicker and help me isolate some shoe treads.
80	00:09:17	00:09:19	Take the pants.
81	00:09:21	00:09:22	So...?
82	00:09:22	00:09:25	How'd you do on the stand?
83	00:09:25	00:09:27	So good the prosecutor took me to dinner.
84	00:09:27	00:09:29	Female?
85	00:09:29	00:09:30	Yeah, she was icing.
86	00:09:30	00:09:34	I was just happy to finally see a case from the crime scene to the courtroom.
87	00:09:34	00:09:36	We freakin' buried the guy.
88	00:09:36	00:09:39	It was bad ass.
89	00:09:39	00:09:42	I dropped the hammer...
90	00:09:42	00:09:44	he was squirming in his chair.
91	00:09:44	00:09:47	How many different patterns you have there?
92	00:09:49	00:09:52	Five different patterns.
93	00:09:52	00:09:56	Well, I've got three different ones on the T-shirt.
94	00:09:56	00:09:59	I mean, this one that looks like an athletic shoe sure got around.
95	00:10:00	00:10:03	As did this pointed toe high-heeled one.
96	00:10:03	00:10:05	Check out the heel mark.
97	00:10:05	00:10:07	So did this work boot.
98	00:10:07	00:10:09	What do you know about work boots?
99	00:10:09	00:10:12	I'm guessing you haven't worked a day of hard labor in your life.
100	00:10:12	00:10:14	I wore Doc Martens in high school.
101	00:10:14	00:10:15	It was the style.
102	00:10:15	00:10:16	Yeah, for skinheads.
103	00:10:17	00:10:19	Yeah, they kind of ruined it for everyone.
104	00:10:21	00:10:25	You know, one of the victims was Hispanic, the other was Jewish.
105	00:10:25	00:10:27	Maybe this was a hate crime.
106	00:10:30	00:10:33	Sure looks like hate to me.
107	00:10:33	00:10:34	Vasco Ruiz was someone's punching bag.
108	00:10:34	00:10:39	He suffered multiple abrasions, lacerations, contusions.
109	00:10:39	00:10:43	I found no particular patterns, sharp edges or tool marks from any weapons.
110	00:10:44	00:10:45	Do fists and feet count?
111	00:10:45	00:10:50	He had too many bruises to count, one on top of another.
112	00:10:51	00:10:54	And under the skin, things get even worse.
113	00:10:54	00:11:00	Long bone fractures of the fingers, radius, ulna, humerus.
114	00:11:00	00:11:03	Rib fractures, flail chest.
115	00:11:03	00:11:05	Fractures of the vault and base of skull.
116	00:11:05	00:11:08	Almost every bone in his face.
117	00:11:08	00:11:13	Somewhere along the way, he took a shot to the head that resulted in a subdural hematoma.
118	00:11:13	00:11:16	COD is multiple blunt force trauma.
119	00:11:16	00:11:18	Could one person have done this?
120	00:11:18	00:11:21	Not even Mike Tyson.
121	00:11:22	00:11:26	Okay, okay, okay, they took my good vodkas, my single-malt whiskies, they took vermouth, cognac, VSOP cognac.
122	00:11:26	00:11:28	Am I going to get any of the stuff back?
123	00:11:28	00:11:30	What are you guys going to do about this?
124	00:11:30	00:11:32	Okay, slow down. You're talking too fast.
125	00:11:32	00:11:34	All right, you know what? Just let me know when you're ready.
126	00:11:34	00:11:37	I'm ready, sir, I just, I just need you to talk slower.
127	00:11:37	00:11:39	Okay, I can do that.
128	00:11:39	00:11:43	These creeps come flying in here, they take a lot of my good stuff.
129	00:11:43	00:11:47	And I chased one of them and I snatched the sweater right off his back.
130	00:11:47	00:11:49	How many did you see?
131	00:11:49	00:11:51	I don't know. There was a bunch.
132	00:11:51	00:11:54	A bunch. Two, five, ten?
133	00:11:55	00:11:56	Closer to the ten.
134	00:11:56	00:11:58	Any descriptions?
135	00:11:58	00:12:00	They had hoods on.
136	00:12:00	00:12:02	They were hooded.
137	00:12:03	00:12:07	You took the sweater off one of them and you didn't get to see what he looked like?
138	00:12:07	00:12:09	He was on his way out the door.
139	00:12:09	00:12:12	What I did see was really weird.
140	00:12:12	00:12:13	Anyway.
141	00:12:13	00:12:14	What does weird look like?
142	00:12:14	00:12:15	I don't know.
143	00:12:15	00:12:20	His face. His nose was all deformed.
144	00:12:20	00:12:21	The whole thing creeped me out.
145	00:12:26	00:12:29	Thank you.
146	00:12:29	00:12:31	Greg...
147	00:12:31	00:12:34	lose the monkey suit, you got a scene; liquor store robbery.
148	00:12:34	00:12:35	Here's the address.
149	00:12:35	00:12:37	Related to the earlier 415s?
150	00:12:38	00:12:39	Could be-- Sofia's got one of the suspect's sweaters.
151	00:12:39	00:12:42	I need you to seal it, bring it back here and anything else you can find.
152	00:12:42	00:12:44	All right. Who's my wingman?
153	00:12:44	00:12:45	You're a big boy, Greg.
154	00:12:46	00:12:47	You don't need a wingman for this.
155	00:12:47	00:12:51	Primary. Nice.
156	00:13:15	00:13:17	Whoa!
157	00:13:17	00:13:19	Pick on somebody you're own size.
158	00:13:20	00:13:23	Are you volunteering?
159	00:13:24	00:13:25	No.
160	00:13:25	00:13:28	The two scenes are related.
161	00:13:28	00:13:34	I found two common treads on both vics; an athletic shoe and a boot.
162	00:13:34	00:13:37	I ran them through the Solemate database.
163	00:13:38	00:13:40	The athletic shoe...
164	00:13:40	00:13:45	is a Converse Chuck Taylor and the boot is a Doc Martin.
165	00:13:47	00:13:49	Could this be a woman's shoe?
166	00:13:49	00:13:52	Yeah, I ran that through the Solemate database, too.
167	00:13:52	00:13:54	That is a Steve Madden Dynasti stiletto.
168	00:13:54	00:13:55	Open-toe shoe.
169	00:13:55	00:13:59	'Cause Catherine found a broken female toenail in the vic's mouth.
170	00:14:01	00:14:06	Most of the treads are on the sides and back of the victim's clothing.
171	00:14:07	00:14:11	Which suggests that they were on the ground for most of the beating.
172	00:14:11	00:14:14	Kicked to death.
173	00:14:19	00:14:22	How am I going to feed my boys?!
174	00:14:22	00:14:28	Pay the rent, gas, car? God...
175	00:14:28	00:14:32	Mrs. Ruiz, I'll do the best I can.
176	00:14:32	00:14:37	I'll put you in touch with State services that'll help you deal with these issues, okay?
177	00:14:37	00:14:40	But right now I need your help to do my job.
178	00:14:40	00:14:42	I need some information, okay?
179	00:14:42	00:14:44	Whatever you need.
180	00:14:44	00:14:46	All right. When was the last time you talked to Vasco?
181	00:14:46	00:14:49	Midnight.
182	00:14:49	00:14:51	He calls me every night after work.
183	00:14:51	00:14:53	Did he have any enemies that you know of?
184	00:14:53	00:14:54	No.
185	00:14:54	00:14:57	He was a good man with a good heart.
186	00:14:57	00:14:59	No one disliked him.
187	00:14:59	00:15:02	Okay. Did he carry a wallet or a cell phone?
188	00:15:02	00:15:04	He had both.
189	00:15:04	00:15:07	I want you to write down his cell phone number on this piece of paper, okay?
190	00:15:07	00:15:09	I need to access his records.
191	00:15:16	00:15:22	Hey, guys, this officer's going to take you and your mom home, make sure you all get home safe, okay?
192	00:15:24	00:15:26	Thank you.
193	00:15:30	00:15:35	I'm standing across from the Holiday Motel where a brutal beating just occurred a few hours ago.
194	00:15:35	00:15:41	We have the footage which was recorded by an anonymous bystander's cell phone.
195	00:15:41	00:15:47	Although the quality is poor, you can see several images assaulting the lone female victim.
196	00:15:48	00:15:52	Anyone living near the strip is being told to stay at home until the assailant is caught.
197	00:15:52	00:15:59	For anyone who has any information, please call 555-0155.
198	00:15:59	00:16:01	Get this reporter on the phone.
199	00:16:35	00:16:37	Control, Control, this is CSI Sanders.
200	00:16:37	00:16:38	I need some help.
201	00:16:38	00:16:41	Control, go with your information.
202	00:16:41	00:16:49	Okay, I got an assault in progress one alley south of Casino Central Drive, cross street Shane.
203	00:16:49	00:16:50	How many suspects involved? Multiple suspects.
204	00:16:50	00:16:52	Could be the guys who've been doing it all night.
205	00:16:53	00:16:54	The closest unit has a five-minute ETA.
206	00:16:54	00:16:56	Rolling Code Three. Are they armed?
207	00:16:56	00:16:58	I don't know. I don't know.
208	00:16:58	00:16:59	Ma'am, please, listen.
209	00:16:59	00:17:01	You got to get here quicker than this.
210	00:17:01	00:17:03	Copy that. We'll roll two additional units ASAP.
211	00:17:03	00:17:05	Wait for backup.
212	00:17:22	00:17:23	Move!
213	00:17:32	00:17:33	Get out of here!
214	00:19:34	00:19:35	Please, let me see Demetrius.
215	00:19:35	00:19:36	I just want to talk to him.
216	00:19:36	00:19:37	I'm sorry. It's a crime scene.
217	00:19:38	00:19:39	I can't let you pass. I'm sorry.
218	00:19:39	00:19:40	He's not dead, is he?
219	00:19:40	00:19:43	He's been badly injured, but he's being attended to, I promise you.
220	00:19:43	00:19:45	Hey. Hey.
221	00:19:47	00:19:49	Why isn't there a medic on Greg?
222	00:19:49	00:19:50	He's been stabilized.
223	00:19:51	00:19:52	Sara, he's going to be okay.
224	00:20:07	00:20:08	Sara...
225	00:20:08	00:20:11	I didn't think you could see me.
226	00:20:11	00:20:14	I can't...
227	00:20:15	00:20:17	but I know that Sidle scent.
228	00:20:17	00:20:20	I'm going to take that as a compliment.
229	00:20:24	00:20:29	I scratched one of them.
230	00:20:29	00:20:31	And you should check my vest.
231	00:20:31	00:20:34	I think the same guy spit on me.
232	00:20:37	00:20:40	And one of their cars crashed into the Denali.
233	00:20:40	00:20:45	I guarantee there's transfer on it.
234	00:20:47	00:20:51	You should process the scene now.
235	00:20:51	00:20:52	Me later.
236	00:20:52	00:20:56	I came here for you, Greg.
237	00:21:07	00:21:10	So how long you been in town, Mr. Tanner?
238	00:21:10	00:21:13	About 20 hours, man.
239	00:21:13	00:21:15	You on vacation?
240	00:21:15	00:21:19	Straight from Union City, Tennessee.
241	00:21:19	00:21:21	Okay, tell me what happened.
242	00:21:21	00:21:29	Well, I was cutting through that alley trying to find a taxi off one of them side streets.
243	00:21:29	00:21:37	Next thing I know I'm on the ground just getting pounded all to hell.
244	00:21:37	00:21:38	I thought I was gonna die.
245	00:21:38	00:21:43	Even give it up to the Man.
246	00:21:43	00:21:48	Then I heard that horn honking and engine revving toward me.
247	00:21:49	00:21:51	Can you give me any descriptions?
248	00:21:54	00:21:55	Okay.
249	00:21:55	00:21:57	All right. You take it easy.
250	00:21:57	00:22:00	Could you do me a favor?
251	00:22:00	00:22:02	Sure, I'll do my best.
252	00:22:02	00:22:08	The man that saved my life, I'd like to meet him, give him a thank you.
253	00:22:08	00:22:10	His name is Greg Sanders.
254	00:22:10	00:22:13	And I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
255	00:22:13	00:22:14	I'll tell him.
256	00:22:21	00:22:24	I think I just found a piece of Sanders' hair.
257	00:22:24	00:22:27	So what, did somebody else get a beat down?
258	00:22:29	00:22:31	You bitches haven't caught them cats yet?
259	00:22:32	00:22:33	Excuse me?
260	00:22:33	00:22:35	You fellas want to keep it moving?
261	00:22:35	00:22:37	We're trying to work here.
262	00:22:37	00:22:42	You call that working? Why is there an ass-whupping on every other block? There's about to be an ass-whupping on this block.
263	00:22:42	00:22:44	Is that right? That's right.
264	00:22:44	00:22:45	Hey, Nick...
265	00:22:45	00:22:48	Man, you're weak, weak, weak, weak. Come on, man.
266	00:22:48	00:22:52	I'm sorry, I'll say what I want. you're not weak.
267	00:22:52	00:22:53	Nick.
268	00:22:53	00:22:56	Nick...
269	00:22:56	00:22:58	You're a joke.
270	00:22:58	00:22:59	Nick.
271	00:23:06	00:23:08	Come on!
272	00:23:08	00:23:10	Anybody get that on video?
273	00:23:10	00:23:12	Man, I'll take a picture myself.
274	00:23:12	00:23:15	That's a nice phone you got there, man.
275	00:23:16	00:23:17	Real nice phone.
276	00:23:17	00:23:22	Wonder how many drug dealers' numbers you got on this phone here.
277	00:23:23	00:23:26	Feel like going to jail tonight?
278	00:23:26	00:23:31	Listen, I'm sorry about the little spill you had earlier, but that's why we got the crime tape up, so you could see it.
279	00:23:31	00:23:34	Watch where you're going next time.
280	00:23:34	00:23:35	Get you home safely.
281	00:23:39	00:23:41	What are you doing?
282	00:23:41	00:23:42	We beating people up now?
283	00:23:42	00:23:44	I'm sick of these punks, man.
284	00:23:44	00:23:46	I'm serious, I'm sick of it.
285	00:23:46	00:23:48	Then you're in the wrong town.
286	00:23:48	00:23:50	Maybe.
287	00:24:10	00:24:12	Greg?
288	00:24:16	00:24:18	Grissom.
289	00:24:19	00:24:22	Just another day at the office, huh?
290	00:24:23	00:24:26	Well, at least I can see now.
291	00:24:31	00:24:33	The guy they beat up...
292	00:24:33	00:24:35	how is he?
293	00:24:36	00:24:38	He's gonna be fine.
294	00:24:41	00:24:43	What about the other guy?
295	00:24:43	00:24:46	The guy I hit.
296	00:24:46	00:24:48	His name is Demitrius James.
297	00:24:48	00:24:50	He's in surgery.
298	00:24:51	00:24:55	Is he, like, a gangbanger or something?
299	00:24:55	00:24:58	Actually...
300	00:24:58	00:25:00	he's a student at the university.
301	00:25:01	00:25:04	He gonna be okay?
302	00:25:04	00:25:07	I don't know.
303	00:25:12	00:25:14	Has someone called your parents?
304	00:25:16	00:25:18	We should let them know.
305	00:25:18	00:25:20	Mm.
306	00:25:20	00:25:21	What's the matter?
307	00:25:21	00:25:25	They still think I'm in the lab.
308	00:25:27	00:25:29	Why do they think that?
309	00:25:29	00:25:33	When I was in high school...
310	00:25:33	00:25:36	I never played any sports.
311	00:25:36	00:25:41	No football, no basketball.
312	00:25:41	00:25:43	Definitely no hockey.
313	00:25:43	00:25:45	I never would've guessed.
314	00:25:46	00:25:48	Well, it wasn't by choice.
315	00:25:49	00:25:52	My mom wanted four kids.
316	00:25:52	00:25:55	Ended up with only one.
317	00:25:55	00:26:00	She always made sure I stayed close.
318	00:26:02	00:26:07	If I got a nosebleed, she'd take me to the E.R.
319	00:26:09	00:26:12	Well...
320	00:26:12	00:26:15	now would be the time to come clean.
321	00:26:16	00:26:20	My mom's gonna freak.
322	00:26:21	00:26:27	You tell her that you risked your life to save someone else's...
323	00:26:27	00:26:30	and I think she'll be very proud of you.
324	00:26:35	00:26:37	Hey.
325	00:26:39	00:26:43	Doctor found these on Demitrius James.
326	00:26:45	00:26:47	Contact lenses. Special kind.
327	00:26:47	00:26:50	They're called Halloween lenses.
328	00:26:50	00:26:52	They're wearing costumes.
329	00:26:53	00:26:55	Great.
330	00:26:55	00:26:57	Just a game to them.
331	00:27:13	00:27:15	Is that your number, Cha Cha?
332	00:27:15	00:27:18	Yeah, that's my number.
333	00:27:18	00:27:21	So tell me...
334	00:27:21	00:27:23	what does a dead guy sound like?
335	00:27:26	00:27:27	Oh, is that funny?
336	00:27:27	00:27:30	Oh, man, I mean, isn't it supposed to be?
337	00:27:32	00:27:35	Someone called you from his phone-- who was it?
338	00:27:35	00:27:37	When'd they call again?
339	00:27:37	00:27:43	33 a.m., last night. Man, you know how many people blow me up at that time?
340	00:27:43	00:27:45	Shoot, that's like prime time.
341	00:27:45	00:27:46	Finding-the-right-party time.
342	00:27:46	00:27:49	Half my calls go to voice mail my line's so busy.
343	00:27:55	00:27:56	Who's this guy? (sighs)
344	00:27:57	00:27:59	M-Maybe I seen him before, I don't know.
345	00:28:06	00:28:08	Farami, huh?
346	00:28:14	00:28:15	Yeah.
347	00:28:15	00:28:17	You like?
348	00:28:17	00:28:19	If it was real, I might.
349	00:28:19	00:28:21	Whatever.
350	00:28:21	00:28:23	Can I go now? Damn.
351	00:28:24	00:28:31	When I swab that knockoff Farami buckle and I find this tourist's DNA on it, you're going down for murder.
352	00:28:31	00:28:33	She didn't die.
353	00:28:33	00:28:35	No, but Mr. Ruiz did.
354	00:28:35	00:28:37	And you were the last person that he called.
355	00:28:37	00:28:39	That connects you to both crimes.
356	00:28:40	00:28:42	Tara, okay?
357	00:28:42	00:28:43	Tara called me.
358	00:28:43	00:28:49	It's funny, 'cause the only reason I picked up my phone is 'cause I didn't know the number.
359	00:28:49	00:28:51	Thought it was this hot boy.
360	00:28:51	00:28:53	And what did Tara want?
361	00:28:54	00:28:57	Her boyfriend Pig invited her to a party at a motel.
362	00:28:57	00:29:00	She invited me, so I rolled.
363	00:29:06	00:29:08	Go get a piece. It's fun.
364	00:29:12	00:29:15	Is that your idea of a party?
365	00:29:15	00:29:17	Man, everyone loves a good fannysmackin' session.
366	00:29:17	00:29:19	A what?
367	00:29:19	00:29:21	Beating up fannypackers.
368	00:29:21	00:29:23	You know, tourists.
369	00:29:23	00:29:25	Why would you want to do that?
370	00:29:25	00:29:28	Nothing else to do.
371	00:29:28	00:29:31	And you do this all the time?
372	00:29:31	00:29:34	Yeah, but this was the first time I ever heard of anyone dying.
373	00:29:35	00:29:37	What is Pig's name?
374	00:29:37	00:29:39	I just know Pig.
375	00:29:39	00:29:45	So if... fannysmackin' is all about tourists, why'd you go after a dishwasher at the Golden Sapphire?
376	00:29:45	00:29:47	I don't know.
377	00:29:47	00:29:50	Maybe he was just practice.
378	00:29:53	00:29:56	So, you think we're out of the woods yet?
379	00:29:56	00:30:01	Well, beatings were occurring every hour, and it's been three hours since the last one, so maybe.
380	00:30:01	00:30:03	Do I look like I want to sign in?
381	00:30:03	00:30:06	I want to talk to cop, okay? Somebody get me a cop!
382	00:30:06	00:30:08	I want to talk to a cop now!
383	00:30:08	00:30:11	He's a cop. She's a cop.
384	00:30:11	00:30:13	Hey, my friend, he got beat up and robbed.
385	00:30:13	00:30:14	I can see that. Where?
386	00:30:14	00:30:17	On the corner of Decatur and Jones.
387	00:30:17	00:30:22	They-they took the ten G's that I had on me, they took my watch, they took my cell phone. And look at his face.
388	00:30:23	00:30:24	They beat him up, too.
389	00:30:24	00:30:25	Did you get a good look at 'em?
390	00:30:25	00:30:26	Not really-- they were wearing hoodies.
391	00:31:30	00:31:33	Processed the sweater found at the liquor store.
392	00:31:33	00:31:34	Found blood.
393	00:31:34	00:31:36	Sent it to DNA.
394	00:31:36	00:31:39	Wendy found two types, matched both to your vics.
395	00:31:39	00:31:42	She also ran saliva on Greg's jacket.
396	00:31:42	00:31:43	Came back unknown male.
397	00:31:43	00:31:46	Same unknown male that Greg scratched.
398	00:31:51	00:31:53	Nice map.
399	00:31:53	00:31:55	What do you see?
400	00:31:55	00:31:57	My old neighborhood.
401	00:31:57	00:31:58	What do you see?
402	00:31:59	00:32:00	Inconsistency.
403	00:32:00	00:32:02	In what?
404	00:32:02	00:32:07	The dishwasher, both tourists and Greg were attacked near the Strip.
405	00:32:07	00:32:11	Dean Harden claims that he was attacked all the way over here in Southwest Las Vegas.
406	00:32:11	00:32:13	Swarms don't backtrack.
407	00:32:13	00:32:16	We're talking about humans here, not bugs.
408	00:32:17	00:32:20	Humans have always adapted strategies from insects.
409	00:32:20	00:32:22	Swarming is an ancient military tactic.
410	00:32:22	00:32:26	You surround your enemies, then attack from all directions simultaneously.
411	00:32:26	00:32:30	Alexander the Great pioneered the maneuver 2,000 years ago.
412	00:32:30	00:32:44	Although swarms consist of several individuals, they must be treated as a single entity, which lives, thinks and moves as one, built with an internal logic to continue forward, gain momentum and never backtrack.
413	00:32:44	00:32:50	So this guy Dean probably was not a victim of this swarm, or he's lying.
414	00:32:50	00:32:52	Take a look at these clothes.
415	00:32:52	00:32:59	In contrast to the other beatings, I found only one type of shoe tread on Dean's clothing.
416	00:33:01	00:33:06	The print matches a size 12 Nike Air.
417	00:33:06	00:33:09	And this shoe is...
418	00:33:09	00:33:11	his own.
419	00:33:11	00:33:14	He swarmed himself?
420	00:33:18	00:33:19	I owe my Uncle Lenny ten G's.
421	00:33:19	00:33:21	and I don't got it, all right?
422	00:33:21	00:33:24	Am I supposed to know who Uncle Lenny is?
423	00:33:24	00:33:26	Uncle Lenny? Lenny G.
424	00:33:26	00:33:28	The famous sports handicapper.
425	00:33:28	00:33:29	Yeah, it's not ringing any bells.
426	00:33:30	00:33:31	He's blackbooked from the casinos.
427	00:33:31	00:33:32	But he still likes to bet.
428	00:33:32	00:33:35	And you bet for him.
429	00:33:35	00:33:38	Yeah, he gave me five dimes to bet the Eagles this past Sunday.
430	00:33:38	00:33:41	You see, me and Ant, we're hurting for cash right now.
431	00:33:41	00:33:45	We didn't think the Eagles had a chance, so we thought we would just pocket the cash.
432	00:33:45	00:33:48	But they won and now you owe Uncle Lenny G. ten G's.
433	00:33:48	00:33:52	Yeah. And when we saw these beatings on TV and...
434	00:33:52	00:33:55	just thought it was a great idea.
435	00:33:55	00:33:56	Don't go near the package.
436	00:33:56	00:33:58	Why am I going to go near your package?
437	00:33:58	00:34:00	All right. All right.
438	00:34:00	00:34:01	It'll be like Pesci did it to DeNiro in Raging Bull.
439	00:34:01	00:34:03	Remember that? Yeah, all right, just do it, man, come on.
440	00:34:03	00:34:04	Okay. All right, just do it, man!
441	00:34:04	00:34:05	I'm doing it!
442	00:34:08	00:34:09	What, are you crying?
443	00:34:09	00:34:11	Shut up, man! It's not funny, all right?!
444	00:34:11	00:34:16	I figured if Dean said we got beat up and robbed, we wouldn't have to pay up.
445	00:34:16	00:34:18	Yeah, well, now you're eleven G's in the hole.
446	00:34:18	00:34:24	The ten thousand you owe Uncle Lenny for the bet, and the thousand you owe us for filing a false police report.
447	00:34:55	00:34:57	Hey, Catherine. I think I'm on to something.
448	00:34:57	00:34:59	Check this out.
449	00:35:02	00:35:05	Oh... the King Swine.
450	00:35:05	00:35:07	Now, y'all is plural.
451	00:35:07	00:35:12	Believe me, I used the word a lot, so I have a feeling he sent that to more than one person.
452	00:35:12	00:35:14	Could be a mass text.
453	00:35:14	00:35:19	Lindsey once sent everyone in her phonebook the same message at the same time.
454	00:35:19	00:35:20	I got stuck with a $300 bill.
455	00:35:20	00:35:23	Hmm, we got this punk's phone number.
456	00:35:23	00:35:25	All we have to do is subpoena his phone records.
457	00:35:25	00:35:28	We'll get every one he sent the message to.
458	00:35:28	00:35:31	We'll text him, we'll tell him to meet us somewhere.
459	00:35:31	00:35:33	From Tara's phone? They'll know it's us.
460	00:35:33	00:35:34	No, from Pig's phone.
461	00:35:35	00:35:36	We don't have Pig's phone.
462	00:35:36	00:35:37	Don't need it.
463	00:35:37	00:35:42	When you text from a computer, you put in the number that you're calling from.
464	00:35:42	00:35:44	We'll just use Miss Piggy's.
465	00:35:44	00:35:47	Okay, but how do we get the Pig?
466	00:35:49	00:35:52	Look, I'm not going to play you, Tara.
467	00:35:52	00:35:54	So let's not waste each other's time.
468	00:35:54	00:35:58	I have enough evidence to try you for first degree murder.
469	00:35:58	00:35:59	But I'm greedy.
470	00:35:59	00:36:02	I want the rest of the Mickey Mouse Club.
471	00:36:02	00:36:04	So you have a choice.
472	00:36:04	00:36:11	You can either spend a very, very long time in jail or you can help me out.
473	00:36:18	00:36:19	I'm not saying nothing.
474	00:36:19	00:36:21	You don't have to sayanything.
475	00:36:29	00:36:31	Write a text message.
476	00:36:31	00:36:36	Something Pig would send to his buddies to gather them all up for another fannysmackin' party.
477	00:36:36	00:36:42	Look, Tara, I don't think that beating these people up was your idea, so why should you and Cha Cha take the fall?
478	00:36:42	00:36:43	These guys don't care about you.
479	00:36:44	00:36:46	I mean, let's face it.
480	00:36:46	00:36:48	You're just a piece of tail to them.
481	00:36:49	00:36:51	Right?
482	00:36:51	00:36:53	So what's it going to be?
483	00:36:53	00:37:00	Are you going to let a guy with the colorful but unfortunate name of Pig run free while you go to jail?
484	00:37:00	00:37:02	You know, it's funky in there.
485	00:37:02	00:37:04	No Posh Spice.
486	00:37:04	00:37:10	No parties, no purses or pedicures or pasta primavera.
487	00:37:10	00:37:13	So you decide.
488	00:37:13	00:37:15	Decide.
489	00:37:28	00:37:30	Pig text you?
490	00:37:30	00:37:32	Yeah.
491	00:37:50	00:37:53	Hey, Pig, thanks for that text.
492	00:37:53	00:37:55	I'm ready for some smackin'. I didn't text you.
493	00:37:55	00:37:58	You didn't? Nah. Did you text me.
494	00:37:58	00:37:59	I didn't text you.
495	00:38:14	00:38:16	Everybody out of the car, now.
496	00:38:16	00:38:19	Get out of the car. Let's see those hands.
497	00:38:20	00:38:23	Put them on the top of the car.
498	00:38:43	00:38:45	Turn off the truck. Get out.
499	00:38:45	00:38:48	And put your hands above your head.
500	00:38:49	00:38:53	Get out of the car.
501	00:39:02	00:39:03	You're going to jail.
502	00:39:04	00:39:06	Free shower, free food, free sleep.
503	00:39:09	00:39:10	Let me in there.
504	00:39:17	00:39:23	This little piggy went, Wee, wee, wee, all the way home.
505	00:39:44	00:39:46	I think this is the room, sir.
506	00:39:46	00:39:48	There he is.
507	00:39:48	00:39:50	Mr. Sanders?
508	00:39:50	00:39:53	Hey. How you doing?
509	00:39:53	00:39:54	Better than dead.
510	00:39:54	00:39:57	Get me over here, Lizzy, where I can shake this man's hand.
511	00:40:01	00:40:02	You're a brave man.
512	00:40:02	00:40:03	Thank you.
513	00:40:04	00:40:05	You're welcome.
514	00:40:05	00:40:08	Home, Elizabeth.
515	00:40:10	00:40:14	I cook some mean barbeque, If you ever get yourself to Union City, Tennessee.
516	00:40:14	00:40:15	I'll look you up.
517	00:40:15	00:40:17	You do that.
518	00:40:58	00:41:02	I am going to pick up some Roberto's, take it over to Greg.
519	00:41:02	00:41:05	I'm sure he's sick of that hospital food-- anybody want to come?
520	00:41:06	00:41:10	I'll take a ride with you, but I'm going to pass 00 in the morning.
521	00:41:11	00:41:14	No, I'd like to see Greg. I'm definitely in, yeah.
522	00:41:14	00:41:19	Pig and the piglets are in the pig pen.
523	00:41:19	00:41:22	It's about time. Finally, some good news.
524	00:41:22	00:41:25	Did you know that Pig, aka Cole Trit, was the only adult.
525	00:41:25	00:41:27	The rest of them were under 18.
526	00:41:27	00:41:30	One was 14. Are you kidding?
527	00:41:30	00:41:32	Who raises these kids?
528	00:41:32	00:41:34	I mean, they weren't all delinquents.
529	00:41:34	00:41:36	Demitrius James was a college student.
530	00:41:36	00:41:38	Hanging out with the wrong crowd in the wrong town.
531	00:41:39	00:41:44	I'm telling you, a fake ID in Las Vegas is like having a free ticket on the hell train.
532	00:41:44	00:41:49	Sex, drugs, gambling, no adult supervision, 24/7.
533	00:41:49	00:41:52	By the time they're 21, they've done and seen it all.
534	00:41:52	00:41:53	Make me slit my wrists, why don't you?
535	00:41:53	00:41:55	I'm raising a teenager here.
536	00:41:55	00:41:59	Oh, you're doing a great job. Lindsey's gonna turn out to be a beautiful young woman.
537	00:41:59	00:42:02	Besides, I grew up in Vegas, I didn't turn out so bad, did I?
538	00:42:02	00:42:08	Yeah, that was pre-Mirage, back when you were a little squirt going to the casino playing the arcade games.
539	00:42:10	00:42:12	No, Vegas is a different animal now.
540	00:42:12	00:42:16	Yeah, these kids need to beat people on the street to be entertained.
541	00:42:16	00:42:17	They just need some good discipline.
542	00:42:17	00:42:22	They need their grandmother whupping their ass like, like I had.
543	00:42:22	00:42:24	Yeah, a good slap.
544	00:42:24	00:42:28	You know, it kind of sounds like your guys are blaming everybody but these kids.
545	00:42:28	00:42:32	I mean, you don't get a bye just 'cause you grew up here or your parents are on drugs.
546	00:42:32	00:42:38	Those kids are perfectly capable of telling the difference between a wild night out and...
547	00:42:38	00:42:40	beating somebody to death.
548	00:42:40	00:42:43	The truth is...
549	00:42:43	00:42:46	a moral compass can only point you in the right direction, can't make you go there.
550	00:42:48	00:42:52	Our culture preaches that, uh, you shouldn't be ashamed of anything you do anymore.
551	00:42:52	00:42:57	And unfortunately, this city was built on the principle that there's no such thing as guilt.
552	00:42:57	00:42:59	Do whatever you want, we won't tell.
553	00:42:59	00:43:03	So without a conscience, there's nothing to stop you from killing someone.
554	00:43:03	00:43:07	And evidently, you don't even have to feel bad about it.
