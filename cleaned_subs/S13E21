0,00:00:01,00:00:03,"All right, we are in the processing room."
1,00:00:03,00:00:05,This is the center of the slaughterhouse.
2,00:00:05,00:00:10,This is where Walter Simms was finally killed in a shootout with the police.
3,00:00:10,00:00:14,And this is where we are going to try to contact his ghost.
4,00:00:14,00:00:17,(clattering)
5,00:00:21,00:00:24,I definitely sense a presence in here.
6,00:00:24,00:00:26,A very strong presence.
7,00:00:26,00:00:28,"Yeah, my whole body feels strange."
8,00:00:28,00:00:30,Hair on my arm's standing up.
9,00:00:30,00:00:34,"I'm gonna roll my EVP recorder, see what we get."
10,00:00:43,00:00:46,"Walter Simms, are you here?"
11,00:00:47,00:00:48,"Come on, Walter."
12,00:00:48,00:00:50,Talk to us.
13,00:00:50,00:00:52,You still lingering?
14,00:00:52,00:00:56,Relishing the seven sadistic murders you committed?
15,00:00:57,00:01:00,I'll tell you what I'm sensing.
16,00:01:00,00:01:02,It's the boys.
17,00:01:02,00:01:04,Their pain.
18,00:01:04,00:01:06,"God, do you feel that?"
19,00:01:06,00:01:11,"I know the terrible things you went through, but it's okay."
20,00:01:11,00:01:13,No one can hurt you now.
21,00:01:18,00:01:22,"Guys, uh, I'm gonna go in the room where the boys were held."
22,00:01:22,00:01:24,Maybe it'll be easier to make contact in there.
23,00:01:24,00:01:25,Okay.
24,00:01:28,00:01:30,I'm gonna set up for some EMF measurements. Doug.
25,00:01:31,00:01:33,You want to go check out the hanging room?
26,00:01:34,00:01:37,All right.
27,00:01:37,00:01:38,(device beeping)
28,00:01:43,00:01:48,"It's been 20 years, and still, the feeling in this place, it's..."
29,00:01:48,00:01:51,it's hard to describe other than to say it feels...
30,00:01:52,00:01:54,...heavy.
31,00:02:05,00:02:08,This is where Walter Simms did his dirty work.
32,00:02:10,00:02:15,"I want you to show yourself, Walter."
33,00:02:15,00:02:17,Make yourself known.
34,00:02:19,00:02:21,Maybe this will entice him.
35,00:02:28,00:02:30,"Yeah, that's right."
36,00:02:30,00:02:34,Just like the one you used to butcher those boys.
37,00:02:34,00:02:37,Why don't you come and get it?
38,00:02:37,00:02:39,It's right there.
39,00:02:39,00:02:43,Or are you too afraid because I'm not some defenseless little child?
40,00:02:43,00:02:45,(metallic jingling)
41,00:02:48,00:02:49,The hooks are moving.
42,00:02:49,00:02:50,(jingling)
43,00:02:50,00:02:53,He's here.
44,00:02:53,00:02:55,(jingling continues)
45,00:02:55,00:02:58,(screaming)
46,00:03:00,00:03:03,(screaming continues)
47,00:03:03,00:03:05,Owen! Owen! Owen!
48,00:03:05,00:03:06,It came from this way.
49,00:03:06,00:03:08,Where's Doug? Where is Doug?
50,00:03:08,00:03:10,(screaming continues)
51,00:03:10,00:03:11,(screaming stops)
52,00:03:11,00:03:15,(woman whimpering)
53,00:03:15,00:03:17,WOMAN: Are you okay? Owen?
54,00:03:17,00:03:18,(panting)
55,00:03:18,00:03:19,(whispering): What is that?
56,00:03:22,00:03:24,"(Carrie screams, Owen yells)"
57,00:03:24,00:03:25,(screaming continues)
58,00:03:25,00:03:27,(siren wailing)
59,00:03:35,00:03:37,Really cheery place.
60,00:03:37,00:03:39,"Yeah, yeah, tell me about it."
61,00:03:39,00:03:42,I spent a lot of time here working on the original case.
62,00:03:42,00:03:44,"What do you mean, original case?"
63,00:03:44,00:03:50,"Oh, uh, 20 years ago, the security guard, Walter Simms-- he lived in a trailer on-site."
64,00:03:50,00:03:57,"This guy, Simms, abducted seven boys over a nine-month period, brought them here and killed them."
65,00:03:57,00:04:01,Mmm. And I mean really grisly stuff.
66,00:04:05,00:04:08,So he ended up dying here himself.
67,00:04:08,00:04:11,"After escaping his sentencing hearing, he shot it out with the PD."
68,00:04:11,00:04:15,So you're saying that this homicide is related to the original case.
69,00:04:15,00:04:18,"Yeah, the victim tonight is rigged up just like the boys were."
70,00:04:24,00:04:28,"The hook, the evisceration-- exactly what Simms did 20 years ago."
71,00:04:32,00:04:38,"You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that old Walter was back from the dead."
72,00:05:22,00:05:25,PHILLIPS: I remember I was in sixth grade when all this was going on.
73,00:05:25,00:05:29,"Walter Simms-- called him ""The Butcher."" Of course, we didn't know it was Simms at the time."
74,00:05:29,00:05:32,We just knew that kids were disappearing.
75,00:05:32,00:05:35,Kids... my age.
76,00:05:35,00:05:39,"And even after Simms was killed, his legend lived on."
77,00:05:39,00:05:46,"They say that if you say his name three times, he'll come back to life and gut you."
78,00:05:46,00:05:48,Maybe that's what happened to our victim.
79,00:05:48,00:05:49,Let's try it.
80,00:05:49,00:05:50,I'll conjure him up.
81,00:05:50,00:05:51,You slap the cuffs on him.
82,00:05:51,00:05:53,Walter Simms.
83,00:05:53,00:05:55,Walter Simms.
84,00:05:55,00:05:56,Walter...
85,00:05:56,00:06:00,"Don't! If you want to do that sort of stuff, you could do it when I'm gone."
86,00:06:00,00:06:01,Let's go.
87,00:06:07,00:06:10,"Oh, you can really see why this place spawned so many ghost stories, huh?"
88,00:06:10,00:06:13,"Oh, yeah. This place creeps me out in all kinds of ways."
89,00:06:13,00:06:14,Slaughterhouse...
90,00:06:14,00:06:16,This is why I stopped eating meat.
91,00:06:16,00:06:17,"Yeah, really."
92,00:06:17,00:06:19,"So, no murder weapon?"
93,00:06:19,00:06:22,No. Smear is from one of the victim's partners.
94,00:06:22,00:06:23,They're the ones that found him.
95,00:06:23,00:06:27,The male slipped and fell in the blood trying to get the victim down.
96,00:06:29,00:06:31,Did our people touch this?
97,00:06:31,00:06:33,No. You think it's been moved?
98,00:06:33,00:06:37,"Well, there's blood on the bottom, but it wasn't in the blood pool."
99,00:06:39,00:06:41,There's no memory card.
100,00:06:41,00:06:42,Somebody must have taken it.
101,00:06:44,00:06:46,Hold up your arms.
102,00:06:46,00:06:47,Okay.
103,00:06:47,00:06:50,"I mean, man, this is just crazy, you know?"
104,00:06:50,00:06:55,"I'm gonna need you to give me your clothes at some point, since you fell in the blood."
105,00:06:55,00:06:57,"Yeah, sure. I got others in the car."
106,00:06:57,00:07:00,"I mean, God, I just can't believe this."
107,00:07:00,00:07:03,"I mean, seriously, Carrie, can you?"
108,00:07:04,00:07:09,"So, uh, how long have you been doing this... ghost hunting?"
109,00:07:09,00:07:10,I don't know.
110,00:07:10,00:07:16,"I've always been sensitive, you know, to... things from the other side."
111,00:07:16,00:07:19,But working with Doug and Owen-- that's new.
112,00:07:19,00:07:20,"A few months, maybe?"
113,00:07:20,00:07:24,And you were filming for some TV show or something?
114,00:07:24,00:07:27,"No, it's, uh, for the Internet, mostly."
115,00:07:27,00:07:29,A lot of people do this. They upload videos.
116,00:07:29,00:07:30,It's... it's really nothing.
117,00:07:30,00:07:32,"Well, it's not nothing anymore."
118,00:07:32,00:07:40,"I mean, holy crap, if we have definitive proof of the spirit world crossing over like this-- I mean, are you kidding me?"
119,00:07:40,00:07:41,"Owen, just stop!"
120,00:07:41,00:07:43,Doug's dead.
121,00:07:43,00:07:44,(sighs)
122,00:07:44,00:07:48,"You don't really think your friend was killed by a ghost, do you?"
123,00:07:49,00:07:51,"You haven't been inside, have you?"
124,00:07:51,00:07:58,"I've been in a lot of haunted places, and I've never felt anything as strong as what I felt in there."
125,00:07:58,00:08:00,That's why I wear this.
126,00:08:00,00:08:04,It's always protected me.
127,00:08:04,00:08:05,(footsteps approaching)
128,00:08:05,00:08:07,I'm gonna ask you one question.
129,00:08:07,00:08:10,Then I'm gonna give you one chance to answer it.
130,00:08:10,00:08:12,Where's the memory card that was in your friend's camera?
131,00:08:12,00:08:14,I don't know what you mean.
132,00:08:14,00:08:16,"He was filming, right, with the camera?"
133,00:08:16,00:08:18,So where's the memory card that was in it?
134,00:08:18,00:08:22,I... (scoffs) Okay. I'm gonna have to confiscate all of your shooting equipment.
135,00:08:22,00:08:27,"No, wait. Okay, okay, uh, I-I took it, okay, but I-I need it."
136,00:08:27,00:08:30,"I mean, what if Doug actually filmed his killer?"
137,00:08:30,00:08:33,Yeah. What if?
138,00:08:33,00:08:36,"I'm Captain Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
139,00:08:36,00:08:38,You the property manager?
140,00:08:38,00:08:39,Thomas Pope.
141,00:08:39,00:08:41,My firm is developing the property.
142,00:08:41,00:08:43,So you've been told what happened?
143,00:08:43,00:08:45,Just that somebody was killed.
144,00:08:45,00:08:46,One of the ghost hunters.
145,00:08:46,00:08:48,"Oh, so you knew they were here?"
146,00:08:48,00:08:50,"Yeah, yeah, they had permission."
147,00:08:50,00:08:52,My boss approved it. I handled the paperwork.
148,00:08:52,00:08:54,They signed about a million liability releases.
149,00:08:54,00:08:56,"Thank God, right?"
150,00:08:56,00:08:58,I guess.
151,00:08:58,00:09:01,"Look, I... I didn't mean it to sound like that. I..."
152,00:09:01,00:09:04,Can I ask what happened exactly?
153,00:09:04,00:09:05,We don't know yet.
154,00:09:07,00:09:10,"You know, I warned my boss that something bad was gonna happen."
155,00:09:10,00:09:12,I knew it.
156,00:09:12,00:09:14,"What do you mean, you knew it?"
157,00:09:14,00:09:16,I spent some time inside here.
158,00:09:16,00:09:18,There's a feeling.
159,00:09:18,00:09:21,A feeling?
160,00:09:21,00:09:22,So you people take all the time you need.
161,00:09:22,00:09:28,"The minute you're done, I'm knocking the whole place down-- the building and all the ghosts inside."
162,00:09:32,00:09:33,"Hey, Doc."
163,00:09:33,00:09:35,"A little shorthanded, are you, today?"
164,00:09:35,00:09:39,"Normally, you don't call me in until you're done with all the scary stuff."
165,00:09:39,00:09:43,"Normally, but I wanted you to see something on the victim David brought in from the slaughterhouse."
166,00:09:43,00:09:46,Heard the murder was reminiscent of a previous crime.
167,00:09:46,00:09:48,"Well, that's why you're here."
168,00:09:48,00:09:51,The killing wasn't just reminiscent.
169,00:09:51,00:09:54,It was an exact duplication of the original crimes.
170,00:09:54,00:09:57,"So, killer did his homework, right?"
171,00:09:57,00:09:58,I don't see how.
172,00:09:58,00:10:00,The original victims were all juveniles.
173,00:10:00,00:10:03,Their autopsy reports were very closely guarded.
174,00:10:03,00:10:05,They were never made public.
175,00:10:05,00:10:08,And the M.O. unique enough that it couldn't just be by chance?
176,00:10:08,00:10:09,I would say not.
177,00:10:11,00:10:17,The incision the killer made-- it isn't a straight cut like a butcher or a hunter would make when dressing an animal.
178,00:10:17,00:10:22,"It waivers to the left, to the right, and then back again."
179,00:10:22,00:10:27,"It's almost as if he was carving an ""S."" ""S"" for Simms."
180,00:10:34,00:10:40,Seems like every town has a place like this that all the teenagers know about.
181,00:10:40,00:10:42,"Yeah, their parents don't."
182,00:10:42,00:10:45,"Obviously, it's not impossible to get in here."
183,00:10:45,00:10:48,Which means our ghost hunters may not have been alone last night.
184,00:11:07,00:11:09,Morgan. Come look at this.
185,00:11:15,00:11:18,It's a shrine.
186,00:11:18,00:11:21,To the seven boys who were murdered here.
187,00:11:22,00:11:25,Some of this stuff looks like it's been here forever.
188,00:11:25,00:11:27,"Yeah, and some of this stuff looks like it's..."
189,00:11:27,00:11:28,pretty new.
190,00:11:28,00:11:31,Someone's been coming here and making offerings to these kids.
191,00:11:31,00:11:33,Or to their ghosts.
192,00:11:37,00:11:39,What?
193,00:11:39,00:11:40,Did you hear something?
194,00:11:40,00:11:42,No.
195,00:11:42,00:11:44,"No, it's nothing."
196,00:11:46,00:11:48,BRODY: Hey.
197,00:11:49,00:11:51,Did you notice...
198,00:11:51,00:11:56,if our female ghost hunter from earlier was missing an earring?
199,00:11:57,00:11:59,SANDERS: No.
200,00:11:59,00:12:00,That's not hers.
201,00:12:00,00:12:03,"Makes me wonder whose, then."
202,00:12:03,00:12:05,"So, let's say you're the victim."
203,00:12:05,00:12:07,It's dark.
204,00:12:07,00:12:09,Your back is turned. You're filming.
205,00:12:09,00:12:13,I swing this hook hard enough to bury it in your back.
206,00:12:13,00:12:18,"Well, that would be more than enough to incapacitate me so you could hoist me up into the air."
207,00:12:18,00:12:20,And then it's just a single slash with the blade.
208,00:12:20,00:12:24,Yeah. So there's no reason it couldn't have been one person working alone.
209,00:12:26,00:12:30,"All right, let's Luminol everything, make sure we didn't miss any blood. (phone ringing)"
210,00:12:30,00:12:32,It's for you.
211,00:12:32,00:12:33,Do you want it? SFPD.
212,00:12:33,00:12:35,I'll call them back.
213,00:12:44,00:12:45,I'm gonna hit the lights. Okay.
214,00:12:48,00:12:49,Whoa.
215,00:12:49,00:12:51,"Oh, my God."
216,00:12:51,00:12:53,There's blood everywhere.
217,00:12:53,00:12:55,Must be animal blood.
218,00:12:55,00:12:57,This is the kill room.
219,00:12:57,00:13:01,Floor must be porous enough that the blood is still present.
220,00:13:01,00:13:04,I'm going to go do the hallway.
221,00:13:12,00:13:14,Finn? Yeah.
222,00:13:14,00:13:17,Come here and look at this.
223,00:13:18,00:13:23,"Wow. Everybody's going in and out, tracking the old animal blood without even knowing it."
224,00:13:23,00:13:24,There's the wheel marks from David's gurney.
225,00:13:24,00:13:27,Mm-hmm.
226,00:13:27,00:13:28,And look over there.
227,00:13:28,00:13:30,There's one set of prints going the other way.
228,00:13:35,00:13:37,The hall dead-ends.
229,00:13:37,00:13:39,Where would they be going?
230,00:13:39,00:13:42,Looks like they walk right through the wall.
231,00:13:42,00:13:46,Or right up to it. There's got to be some reason whoever left these came down here.
232,00:13:56,00:13:58,There's something in here.
233,00:14:05,00:14:08,"Yes, there is."
234,00:14:08,00:14:11,Hey. I think Hodges caught us a break.
235,00:14:11,00:14:12,Check this out.
236,00:14:12,00:14:14,What am I looking at?
237,00:14:14,00:14:17,You're looking at footage from one of the ghost hunter's cameras.
238,00:14:17,00:14:19,"The surviving male, Owen Webber."
239,00:14:21,00:14:25,"Now, according to his statement, he was alone in the processing room during the murder."
240,00:14:25,00:14:26,"Which it looks like he is, right?"
241,00:14:26,00:14:28,"Well, keep watching there."
242,00:14:30,00:14:33,You see that? You mean that little glitch in the picture?
243,00:14:33,00:14:35,That's more than just a glitch.
244,00:14:35,00:14:38,His camera shut off for 98 seconds.
245,00:14:38,00:14:40,That might be enough time to commit the murder.
246,00:14:40,00:14:41,That's more than enough time. (knocking)
247,00:14:41,00:14:43,RUSSELL: Oh!
248,00:14:43,00:14:45,Look at you. You got yourself a murder weapon.
249,00:14:45,00:14:47,It was stashed just outside the murder room.
250,00:14:47,00:14:50,Killer probably planned to go back and get it later.
251,00:14:50,00:14:53,"What makes you say that? Well, because he didn't bother to wipe off his fingerprints."
252,00:14:53,00:14:54,You got prints?
253,00:14:54,00:14:57,Victim's partner. Owen Webber.
254,00:15:05,00:15:07,"Well, it's about time."
255,00:15:07,00:15:08,When am I gonna get my gear back?
256,00:15:08,00:15:09,You're not gonna get your gear back.
257,00:15:09,00:15:12,"What? Well, your gear is what we now call evidence, Owen."
258,00:15:12,00:15:14,"Well, I know that it's evidence."
259,00:15:14,00:15:15,That's why I need it.
260,00:15:15,00:15:19,The online paranormal groups are going nuts over what happened to Doug. I need the proof.
261,00:15:19,00:15:21,I need to show them that it was Simms.
262,00:15:21,00:15:22,Sit down.
263,00:15:22,00:15:26,And let's talk about what you did to Doug.
264,00:15:28,00:15:30,"STOKES: You recognize that, Owen?"
265,00:15:30,00:15:31,It's mine.
266,00:15:31,00:15:34,I brought it along to the slaughterhouse.
267,00:15:34,00:15:36,"Sounds like premeditation. Uh, no."
268,00:15:36,00:15:39,I-I... I brought it to excite the spirits.
269,00:15:39,00:15:45,"We use objects, something emotionally significant to the dead to provoke them."
270,00:15:45,00:15:49,"I mean, come on, man, that's Ghost Chasing 101."
271,00:15:49,00:15:50,That's Murder 101.
272,00:15:50,00:15:54,What?! Why else did you turn off the camera right before Doug was killed?
273,00:15:54,00:15:57,I didn't turn off the camera. My battery pack went dead.
274,00:15:57,00:15:59,Don't you check your batteries before you start?
275,00:15:59,00:16:00,"Yeah, of course I did."
276,00:16:00,00:16:01,And they were both full.
277,00:16:01,00:16:04,But spirits can siphon the power away.
278,00:16:04,00:16:06,That's how they get the energy to materialize.
279,00:16:06,00:16:10,"Come on, Shaggy. My BS meter is redlining with all this ghost science of yours."
280,00:16:10,00:16:11,What BS?
281,00:16:11,00:16:14,The knife provoked Walter Simms.
282,00:16:14,00:16:18,The battery provided the energy he needed.
283,00:16:18,00:16:22,The very fact that Doug is dead is proof positive of what I'm telling you!
284,00:16:26,00:16:28,"Owen didn't kill Doug, I'm telling you."
285,00:16:28,00:16:29,Because you believe a...
286,00:16:29,00:16:31,ghost killed Doug?
287,00:16:31,00:16:33,Because I know Owen.
288,00:16:33,00:16:35,He would never.
289,00:16:35,00:16:38,"Well, right now, the evidence says otherwise."
290,00:16:39,00:16:42,"You went into the slaughterhouse, didn't you?"
291,00:16:42,00:16:43,(sighs)
292,00:16:43,00:16:47,"You know now what I was talking about, those little boys..."
293,00:16:47,00:16:48,The only thing I felt in there...
294,00:16:48,00:16:50,was cold.
295,00:16:50,00:16:51,If you'll excuse me.
296,00:16:54,00:16:55,Why are you denying your gift?
297,00:16:55,00:16:58,"Your grandmother is still with you, you know."
298,00:16:58,00:17:01,"Even though you try to push her away, she's still there."
299,00:17:06,00:17:10,What do you know about my grandmother?
300,00:17:10,00:17:13,She had a funny name.
301,00:17:13,00:17:16,"(chuckles) Olaf, was it?"
302,00:17:16,00:17:18,And she was a psychic.
303,00:17:18,00:17:20,"Seems to think you are, too."
304,00:17:20,00:17:23,You share her gift.
305,00:17:24,00:17:27,What do you want from me?
306,00:17:27,00:17:28,Your help.
307,00:17:29,00:17:31,You heard those boys.
308,00:17:31,00:17:34,I know they were trying to say something.
309,00:17:34,00:17:35,I-I just don't know what it is.
310,00:17:38,00:17:41,"I'm sorry, but I can't help you."
311,00:17:44,00:17:46,"Thanks, but..."
312,00:17:46,00:17:47,I don't want that.
313,00:17:49,00:17:51,You need it.
314,00:17:57,00:17:59,ANDREWS: What are all these?
315,00:17:59,00:18:02,Tools of the trade for the modern ghost hunter.
316,00:18:02,00:18:07,"E.M. pump, motion sensors, thermal imager, EMF detectors."
317,00:18:07,00:18:09,Ghost Meter Pro? Really?
318,00:18:09,00:18:10,Someone actually makes these?
319,00:18:10,00:18:12,That's not a toy.
320,00:18:12,00:18:13,I just spoke with Nick.
321,00:18:13,00:18:15,Apparently the interrogation was less than fruitful.
322,00:18:15,00:18:20,He's hoping that we can find a way to pinpoint the exact location of the suspect during the time of the murder.
323,00:18:20,00:18:22,"But both his cameras were off, right?"
324,00:18:22,00:18:25,"His cameras were off, but his EVP recorder was still on."
325,00:18:25,00:18:26,EVP?
326,00:18:26,00:18:28,Electronic Voice Phenomenon.
327,00:18:28,00:18:32,Ghost voices we might otherwise miss.
328,00:18:32,00:18:35,"The point is, even though we don't have picture, we have sound."
329,00:18:35,00:18:38,Ah. And you think you can use the sound to figure out where the suspect was.
330,00:18:38,00:18:40,"That is the idea, yes."
331,00:18:40,00:18:42,"So, why do you need me?"
332,00:18:42,00:18:45,"You mean, aside from the fact that I greatly admire your mind and abilities?"
333,00:18:48,00:18:53,"The job requires going back to the slaughterhouse, and that is something that I don't relish doing alone."
334,00:18:55,00:18:57,"Hey, Jules?"
335,00:18:57,00:18:58,Do you got a moment?
336,00:18:58,00:18:59,Sure.
337,00:18:59,00:19:01,Want you to introduce you to Scott Tunnicliff.
338,00:19:01,00:19:03,CSI Finlay.
339,00:19:03,00:19:04,Nice to meet you.
340,00:19:04,00:19:07,Scott's kind of an expert on Walter Simms and the slaughterhouse murders.
341,00:19:07,00:19:09,Wrote a book back in the day.
342,00:19:09,00:19:11,Ah. You working on a sequel?
343,00:19:11,00:19:13,"No, actually, I brought him in."
344,00:19:13,00:19:16,He had considerable access to the investigation at the time. My uncle was...
345,00:19:16,00:19:20,"undersheriff, so admittedly, I got... special treatment."
346,00:19:20,00:19:24,But I brought along all my old raw research material if it'll help.
347,00:19:24,00:19:26,"Tell her your theory, Scott."
348,00:19:26,00:19:29,"I've always felt, uh, Simms had an accomplice."
349,00:19:29,00:19:32,"Uh, someone to help lure the boys into the car."
350,00:19:32,00:19:35,"RUSSELL: Yeah, look at this. This is a photo of Simms. That's a real boogeyman."
351,00:19:35,00:19:37,"Yeah, not really a face that kids would flock to."
352,00:19:37,00:19:41,There were witnesses to three of the abductions. The statements were the same.
353,00:19:41,00:19:44,"The boys approached Simms' car, climbed in on their own accord."
354,00:19:44,00:19:47,"So, might be Simms had help."
355,00:19:47,00:19:48,FINLAY: Who's this woman?
356,00:19:48,00:19:50,She's in every trial photo.
357,00:19:50,00:19:52,She was a trial groupie.
358,00:19:52,00:19:54,"Showed up every day, never took her eyes off Simms."
359,00:19:54,00:19:55,Was obsessed with him.
360,00:19:55,00:19:56,RUSSELL: Why?
361,00:19:56,00:19:58,What do you see?
362,00:19:58,00:19:59,Her earring.
363,00:19:59,00:20:02,It looks exactly like the earring Morgan found at the slaughterhouse.
364,00:20:02,00:20:04,"If it is, she was there."
365,00:20:05,00:20:07,"So, where is she now?"
366,00:20:07,00:20:09,(shouting)
367,00:20:09,00:20:11,How was that?
368,00:20:11,00:20:12,"HODGES: All right, do it again."
369,00:20:12,00:20:16,"This time, a little higher like on the recording."
370,00:20:16,00:20:19,(higher-pitched shouting)
371,00:20:21,00:20:24,"All right, I think you nailed it on that last one."
372,00:20:24,00:20:26,Pretty sure we can pinpoint where Owen was now.
373,00:20:26,00:20:28,Yeah.
374,00:20:28,00:20:30,No way he was the killer.
375,00:20:30,00:20:33,He was in this room when the murders happened.
376,00:20:33,00:20:38,"Of course, that means that our killer is still on the loose, right? (chuckles)"
377,00:20:44,00:20:45,(gasps)
378,00:20:45,00:20:46,(sighs)
379,00:20:46,00:20:48,How'd we do?
380,00:20:48,00:20:50,I hope you got what you needed.
381,00:20:50,00:20:52,My throat is killing me.
382,00:20:52,00:20:53,"Well, we cleared Owen as the killer."
383,00:20:54,00:20:57,Did you see all this low-end activity running through the center?
384,00:20:57,00:20:59,"Yeah, it's some sort of low-frequency wave."
385,00:20:59,00:21:01,Seems to be present everywhere in this place.
386,00:21:01,00:21:02,But we can't hear it because it's...
387,00:21:02,00:21:04,Because it's below the human range of hearing.
388,00:21:04,00:21:06,It's infrasound.
389,00:21:06,00:21:10,"Can you, uh, pitch it up? Raise the frequency until we can hear it? Mmm."
390,00:21:10,00:21:12,"(low, rumbling tone)"
391,00:21:14,00:21:21,"Yeah. You know, there are studies that actually suggest that infrasound could be the scientific cause of hauntings."
392,00:21:21,00:21:25,The vibrations create sensory phenomena suggestive of a ghost.
393,00:21:25,00:21:27,Fascinating. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
394,00:21:27,00:21:28,You'll have to show me those articles some time.
395,00:21:28,00:21:33,"We could test the theory now, by finding the source of the low-frequency waves and eliminating it."
396,00:21:33,00:21:35,Science!
397,00:21:40,00:21:42,Wow. Who's the crazy?
398,00:21:42,00:21:44,"Ah, you can tell right away, right?"
399,00:21:44,00:21:47,This woman was obsessed with Walter Simms.
400,00:21:47,00:21:50,Mmm. She was at his trial every single day.
401,00:21:50,00:21:52,"Yeah, we've dealt with a few women like this."
402,00:21:52,00:21:53,I'll never understand it.
403,00:21:53,00:21:56,"So, I think she could be our killer."
404,00:21:56,00:21:58,But there is no record of her name.
405,00:21:58,00:22:03,"I did a facial recognition search against our database, and I got nothing."
406,00:22:03,00:22:06,Why not try running one just against Internet images?
407,00:22:06,00:22:08,She didn't hide from the camera before.
408,00:22:08,00:22:09,Why should she be any different now?
409,00:22:10,00:22:12,"All right, let's run it."
410,00:22:14,00:22:15,Who knows?
411,00:22:15,00:22:17,"You know, maybe she's..."
412,00:22:17,00:22:18,turned her life around by now.
413,00:22:20,00:22:22,That one.
414,00:22:22,00:22:24,Monica Downs.
415,00:22:24,00:22:25,"Wow, she even has a Friend Agenda page."
416,00:22:29,00:22:31,Hmm.
417,00:22:31,00:22:34,20 years has done nothing to cure the crazy.
418,00:22:34,00:22:39,"The basic theory behind infrasound is that, even though we can't hear it, it still has a physiological effect on us."
419,00:22:39,00:22:43,The low frequency waves cause vibrations in different parts of our bodies.
420,00:22:43,00:22:44,(beeping)
421,00:22:44,00:22:47,Getting stronger.
422,00:22:47,00:22:49,"I hear some other noises, as well."
423,00:22:51,00:22:52,"Here, this way. Okay."
424,00:22:52,00:22:59,"So, as a result, people experience butterflies in the stomach, chills, hairs standing on end..."
425,00:22:59,00:23:01,"Check, check and check."
426,00:23:01,00:23:05,"Not realizing there's a physical cause, people attribute all these sensations to..."
427,00:23:06,00:23:08,...a haunting.
428,00:23:14,00:23:17,Feeling's getting stronger here.
429,00:23:17,00:23:18,Definitely oppressive. Yeah.
430,00:23:18,00:23:21,This is it. This is what's generating the infrasound.
431,00:23:21,00:23:25,"Oh, well, here's an idea: Let's turn it off."
432,00:23:29,00:23:30,Uh...
433,00:23:30,00:23:32,Uh...
434,00:23:36,00:23:38,(fan whines)
435,00:23:40,00:23:41,(chuckles)
436,00:23:41,00:23:42,That's amazing.
437,00:23:42,00:23:43,The oppressive feeling's gone.
438,00:23:43,00:23:45,"The chills, the stomach..."
439,00:23:45,00:23:47,"It's gone, right? Yeah."
440,00:23:47,00:23:51,"All these years, the sensation everyone's had that this place is haunted..."
441,00:23:51,00:23:53,It's perfectly benign.
442,00:23:53,00:23:54,There's nothing bad here at all.
443,00:23:54,00:23:57,(woman screams) Aah!
444,00:23:57,00:23:58,WOMAN: No! No! (metal clanging)
445,00:23:58,00:23:59,"Okay, what is that?"
446,00:24:01,00:24:03,"Oh, no, nothing bad can happen here."
447,00:24:03,00:24:04,There's no haunting.
448,00:24:04,00:24:05,It's just sound waves! Shh.
449,00:24:05,00:24:06,This way.
450,00:24:06,00:24:08,We got blood.
451,00:24:12,00:24:14,"ANDREWS: Oh, God, it's one of the ghost hunters."
452,00:24:14,00:24:16,Your infrasound can't explain that.
453,00:24:16,00:24:17,"Yeah, it's Hodges."
454,00:24:17,00:24:19,We need help.
455,00:24:34,00:24:36,So...
456,00:24:36,00:24:40,"it looks like she was sitting there, in front of the shrine."
457,00:24:40,00:24:43,"Killer surprised her, maybe."
458,00:24:43,00:24:46,Hit her as she turned around.
459,00:24:46,00:24:48,The bat was here already.
460,00:24:48,00:24:49,You remember?
461,00:24:49,00:24:51,It was part of the toy collection.
462,00:24:51,00:24:54,What I can't figure out is why she came back here in the first place.
463,00:24:54,00:24:56,She came because of the boys.
464,00:24:57,00:25:01,She told me she was still hearing their voices.
465,00:25:01,00:25:02,She wanted...
466,00:25:02,00:25:04,to talk to them.
467,00:25:04,00:25:07,"Well, she's talking to them now."
468,00:25:07,00:25:11,"We need to find out who else has been coming here, bringing all these toys."
469,00:25:11,00:25:14,Better bag them up and get them to Henry.
470,00:25:24,00:25:25,What? What is it?
471,00:25:27,00:25:29,Her EVP Recorder.
472,00:25:29,00:25:31,Must have fallen when she was struck.
473,00:25:35,00:25:39,CARRIE (over recorder): I'm sorry for all the horrible things that were done to you.
474,00:25:39,00:25:41,What can I do to bring you peace?
475,00:25:41,00:25:44,"Please, I know you're here. I can feel you."
476,00:25:44,00:25:46,Don't be afraid. Just reach out.
477,00:25:46,00:25:49,Talk to me. Give me a sign.
478,00:25:52,00:25:55,"Funny, kind of looks like you're..."
479,00:25:55,00:25:57,waiting to hear an answer.
480,00:26:00,00:26:04,"You don't know this about me, but, uh..."
481,00:26:04,00:26:08,"when I was younger, I used to be..."
482,00:26:08,00:26:10,kind of psychic.
483,00:26:11,00:26:12,I know.
484,00:26:12,00:26:15,"But my grandmother, she had it."
485,00:26:17,00:26:20,And I guess I inherited it.
486,00:26:22,00:26:25,(chuckles) Why have I never heard about this?
487,00:26:25,00:26:34,"When I became a CSI, I felt like I had to choose: science or..."
488,00:26:34,00:26:36,the other.
489,00:26:36,00:26:37,I chose science.
490,00:26:37,00:26:41,"So, now you've reconsidered?"
491,00:26:41,00:26:42,Yeah.
492,00:26:42,00:26:45,"I mean, 'cause of Carrie..."
493,00:26:45,00:26:47,and what I feel in this place.
494,00:26:47,00:26:53,"But I-I thought the feelings came from the infrasound, the vibrations from the ventilation fan."
495,00:26:53,00:26:55,"Henry turned it off, and since then, I-I don't feel a thing anymore."
496,00:26:55,00:26:56,That's just it.
497,00:26:56,00:26:59,I still do.
498,00:27:01,00:27:03,CARRIE: I only want to help you.
499,00:27:03,00:27:06,"That's all I want, is for you to have peace."
500,00:27:06,00:27:08,"Where did you... God, no..."
501,00:27:08,00:27:11,"(metal thuds, clangs)"
502,00:27:11,00:27:12,(gasps)
503,00:27:12,00:27:15,(children laughing)
504,00:27:15,00:27:16,Did you hear that? Yeah.
505,00:27:16,00:27:17,Sounded like laughter.
506,00:27:17,00:27:19,"Like kids. No, play it again."
507,00:27:19,00:27:20,(Carrie screams)
508,00:27:20,00:27:21,(metal clangs)
509,00:27:21,00:27:23,(children laughing)
510,00:27:26,00:27:27,Ow. Ow.
511,00:27:27,00:27:31,You can't possibly know what I know.
512,00:27:31,00:27:38,"Blinded by the confines of corporeal reality, you're both woefully ignorant of what waits on the other side..."
513,00:27:38,00:27:39,"Got your trial groupie. Ma'am, that's enough."
514,00:27:39,00:27:41,That was quite a ride.
515,00:27:41,00:27:43,For you.
516,00:27:43,00:27:45,Good luck.
517,00:27:45,00:27:46,She's a nutcase.
518,00:27:46,00:27:49,"Yeah, a nutcase with blood on her shoes."
519,00:27:49,00:27:54,Your shoes and this shoe print that we found at the murder scene...
520,00:27:54,00:27:55,they match.
521,00:27:55,00:27:56,"Match, match, three on a match."
522,00:27:56,00:27:59,"And that's bad luck, you know."
523,00:27:59,00:28:00,Want to talk about bad luck?
524,00:28:00,00:28:02,You stepped in a dead woman's blood.
525,00:28:06,00:28:07,(chuckles)
526,00:28:07,00:28:10,I remember you.
527,00:28:10,00:28:11,You do?
528,00:28:11,00:28:13,From Walter's trial.
529,00:28:13,00:28:14,I do.
530,00:28:14,00:28:16,How wonderful.
531,00:28:16,00:28:19,"Now, do you remember being at the slaughterhouse earlier?"
532,00:28:19,00:28:22,I do.
533,00:28:22,00:28:25,I went to talk to Walter and my boys.
534,00:28:25,00:28:27,Your boys?
535,00:28:27,00:28:28,"Yes, that's what I said-- my boys."
536,00:28:28,00:28:31,My family.
537,00:28:31,00:28:36,The family that Walter created for... us.
538,00:28:36,00:28:40,"BRASS: So, when when you talked to Walter, did he tell you to kill Carrie?"
539,00:28:43,00:28:45,How about Doug?
540,00:28:47,00:28:48,(giggles) BRASS: Huh?
541,00:28:48,00:28:50,I didn't do that.
542,00:28:50,00:28:53,But I... I know who did.
543,00:28:53,00:28:54,You do?
544,00:28:54,00:28:57,He didn't know that I was there watching.
545,00:28:57,00:28:59,"Ticktock, like a watch."
546,00:28:59,00:29:02,BRASS: Tell us who you saw do this.
547,00:29:04,00:29:06,It was one of my boys.
548,00:29:06,00:29:08,Mine and Walter's.
549,00:29:08,00:29:10,"Kids, you know?"
550,00:29:10,00:29:12,I should probably have a talk with him...
551,00:29:12,00:29:14,if you'd like.
552,00:29:16,00:29:18,(children laughing)
553,00:29:20,00:29:22,Morgan said it was eerie.
554,00:29:22,00:29:23,She wasn't lying.
555,00:29:23,00:29:26,Yeah. That came just after the killing?
556,00:29:26,00:29:27,Yeah.
557,00:29:27,00:29:28,But listen.
558,00:29:28,00:29:30,"(hiss, children laughing)"
559,00:29:30,00:29:33,"Now, I'm pretty sure the laughter's real."
560,00:29:33,00:29:34,But it's prerecorded.
561,00:29:34,00:29:36,How do you know that?
562,00:29:36,00:29:39,"Watch the screen as I play it, and I'll freeze the wave form."
563,00:29:39,00:29:40,(metal clangs)
564,00:29:40,00:29:43,"(hiss, children laughing)"
565,00:29:43,00:29:50,"Now, right there, just before the laughter, there's a high-frequency hiss, almost, and then it dies out immediately after."
566,00:29:50,00:29:53,"(children laughing, hissing)"
567,00:29:53,00:29:55,What is it?
568,00:29:55,00:29:58,"Well, it's got to be the speaker on whatever device is playing."
569,00:29:58,00:30:03,It powers up just a fraction of a second before the sound comes out.
570,00:30:03,00:30:06,So the killer played a recording of children laughing just after the murder?
571,00:30:08,00:30:10,That might be even sicker.
572,00:30:55,00:30:57,"(machine beeps, whirs)"
573,00:31:01,00:31:04,"Hey, just finished DNA analysis on the toys."
574,00:31:04,00:31:05,And?
575,00:31:05,00:31:08,I found DNA from a single source on every single one of them.
576,00:31:08,00:31:10,What about the murder weapon?
577,00:31:10,00:31:11,"Same DNA, same as the rest of the toys."
578,00:31:11,00:31:14,Let me guess.
579,00:31:14,00:31:16,"It belongs to the psycho groupie, Monica Downs."
580,00:31:16,00:31:17,"Actually, no."
581,00:31:17,00:31:19,The source was an unknown male.
582,00:31:19,00:31:21,Suggests that Monica Downs is not the killer.
583,00:31:21,00:31:23,ANDREWS: It gets stranger.
584,00:31:23,00:31:26,Finlay gave me DNA from the original investigation of the Simms murders.
585,00:31:26,00:31:30,Cops collected one sample from Simms' car that was never identified.
586,00:31:30,00:31:33,Matched the DNA on the toys and the baseball bat.
587,00:31:33,00:31:36,So we're saying the killer was in Simms' car 20 years ago.
588,00:31:36,00:31:38,In the front seat of Simms' car.
589,00:31:38,00:31:41,All the DNA from the boys who were killed came from the back of the car.
590,00:31:41,00:31:45,"Well, it sounds to me like we're back to looking for an accomplice."
591,00:31:45,00:31:47,Certainly does.
592,00:31:49,00:31:54,"A male, obsessed with the crime, enough knowledge of the details to be able to re-create them perfectly."
593,00:31:56,00:31:57,What do you think?
594,00:32:03,00:32:06,Yeah.
595,00:32:06,00:32:09,(chuckles) Then come back here and rub our faces in it.
596,00:32:18,00:32:20,"Well, his alibi checks out."
597,00:32:20,00:32:23,"He said he was at a book signing, he was at a book signing."
598,00:32:23,00:32:28,"What about the DNA? Sent it to Henry, but I'm afraid it's only gonna confirm that..."
599,00:32:28,00:32:29,he's not our guy.
600,00:32:29,00:32:32,"Oh, hell."
601,00:32:32,00:32:33,Well...
602,00:32:33,00:32:35,(both sigh)
603,00:32:35,00:32:37,I still like our theory.
604,00:32:37,00:32:39,Looking for the old accomplice in the current murders?
605,00:32:39,00:32:41,"I mean, we know he's a male."
606,00:32:41,00:32:43,We know he was in Simms's car 20 years ago.
607,00:32:43,00:32:46,What we don't know is where he is now.
608,00:32:46,00:32:48,Exactly.
609,00:32:48,00:32:50,"All right, just-just play with me for a second."
610,00:32:50,00:32:54,"Monica Downs said that she saw Carrie's killer, right?"
611,00:32:54,00:32:55,That it was one of the boys.
612,00:32:55,00:32:56,Monica Downs is crazy.
613,00:32:56,00:32:58,The boys are dead.
614,00:32:58,00:33:00,"All right, all right, but what if they're not?"
615,00:33:00,00:33:03,"Russell, the cops found all seven bodies."
616,00:33:03,00:33:05,What if there was an eighth? (sighs)
617,00:33:05,00:33:11,What-what if... what if Simms abducted an eighth boy and forced him to be his accomplice?
618,00:33:11,00:33:15,"Cops finally catch up with Simms and put him in jail, boy runs away."
619,00:33:15,00:33:17,Which means he might still be out there.
620,00:33:23,00:33:25,(clears throat) What are those?
621,00:33:25,00:33:27,Missing persons reports from 20 years ago.
622,00:33:27,00:33:29,When Simms was snatching up kids. Yeah.
623,00:33:29,00:33:33,I found three other boys that disappeared within that timeframe who were never accounted for.
624,00:33:33,00:33:35,"Well, only one of them has a photo."
625,00:33:35,00:33:39,"Yeah, as far as the other two go-- uh, Brian Oden grew up on the streets."
626,00:33:39,00:33:41,There were quite a few homeless that reported him missing.
627,00:33:41,00:33:43,And Jonathan Harris grew up in foster care.
628,00:33:43,00:33:50,"Everybody just thought he ran away, including PD. FINLAY: So, any one of these could be Simms' eighth victim, our so-called accomplice."
629,00:33:50,00:33:52,How do we I.D. him and find him?
630,00:33:52,00:33:54,FINLAY: This kid was in Simms' car.
631,00:33:54,00:33:56,"Okay, his DNA is in there."
632,00:33:56,00:33:57,He must have left prints.
633,00:33:57,00:33:59,But PD ran the prints 20 years ago.
634,00:33:59,00:34:02,"Yeah, but he was a juvenile, so he wasn't in the system."
635,00:34:02,00:34:04,You're right. Got to be over 30 by now.
636,00:34:04,00:34:05,Maybe that's changed.
637,00:34:08,00:34:10,Hey.
638,00:34:12,00:34:13,Where are you going?
639,00:34:13,00:34:17,"If anybody's looking for me, just tell them I had to step out a little while."
640,00:34:17,00:34:19,You going to the slaughterhouse?
641,00:34:19,00:34:20,I thought we wrapped all that up.
642,00:34:20,00:34:22,The place is about to get torn down.
643,00:34:22,00:34:26,"If I don't do this now, I'll never get the chance."
644,00:34:26,00:34:28,"Greg, what do you really expect to find there?"
645,00:34:28,00:34:30,I don't know. Maybe nothing.
646,00:34:30,00:34:34,"Or maybe I'll be able to reach out to Carrie, and with her help, maybe to the boys."
647,00:34:34,00:34:36,"You know how that sounds, right?"
648,00:34:36,00:34:38,Yeah. Crazy.
649,00:34:38,00:34:41,But it doesn't matter.
650,00:34:41,00:34:43,I have to do this.
651,00:35:25,00:35:27,Here we go.
652,00:35:27,00:35:31,Got a hit on the set of prints from the glove box in Simms' car.
653,00:35:31,00:35:32,What's the date of birth?
654,00:35:32,00:35:35,"June 8, '81."
655,00:35:35,00:35:37,Means he was 11 at the time.
656,00:35:37,00:35:39,"Okay, so this has got to be our eighth kid, right?"
657,00:35:39,00:35:40,SARA: Scroll down.
658,00:35:40,00:35:42,Wait a minute. I saw him.
659,00:35:42,00:35:45,"Where? At the slaughterhouse that first morning, talking to Brass."
660,00:35:45,00:35:46,"Well, who is he?"
661,00:35:46,00:35:48,He manages the property.
662,00:35:48,00:35:52,Thanks again for coming down to let me in.
663,00:35:52,00:35:54,I really appreciate it.
664,00:35:54,00:35:55,No problem.
665,00:35:59,00:36:01,(door creaking)
666,00:36:03,00:36:05,After you.
667,00:36:18,00:36:22,"You know, in a couple of days, this whole place will be gone."
668,00:36:22,00:36:25,Bulldozed to the ground.
669,00:36:25,00:36:28,"The building, everything inside."
670,00:36:28,00:36:31,What were you hoping to find?
671,00:36:31,00:36:33,(sighs)
672,00:36:33,00:36:36,I don't really know.
673,00:36:45,00:36:48,"Well, but you're here."
674,00:36:49,00:36:51,Right?
675,00:36:51,00:36:53,You must have some idea.
676,00:37:16,00:37:19,"You want to talk to them, don't you?"
677,00:37:19,00:37:22,(children laughing)
678,00:37:22,00:37:25,"Sorry. It's, uh, my kids' ringtone."
679,00:37:25,00:37:28,It's my wife calling.
680,00:37:32,00:37:34,Don't.
681,00:37:36,00:37:38,Just drop it!
682,00:37:40,00:37:42,Haven't enough people died here?
683,00:37:50,00:37:59,"BRASS: Thomas Pope-- family man, wife and kids, good job, an education, but that's only half of who you really are."
684,00:37:59,00:38:00,"See, Thomas Pope is an invention."
685,00:38:00,00:38:01,You made it up.
686,00:38:01,00:38:04,He doesn't exist before about 12 years ago.
687,00:38:04,00:38:06,"Your real name is Jonathan Harris, isn't it?"
688,00:38:06,00:38:16,"When you grew up, you were passed from one foster home to another until one day your luck really went bad and you were abducted by Walter Simms."
689,00:38:16,00:38:18,"No, you're wrong. You're mistaken."
690,00:38:18,00:38:21,"Well, we found your DNA in Walter Simms' car, along with your fingerprints."
691,00:38:21,00:38:24,"We're not wrong, Jonathan. We know who you are."
692,00:38:25,00:38:27,I am not Jonathan.
693,00:38:27,00:38:31,"I am not that damaged little boy, not anymore."
694,00:38:34,00:38:39,"I know you feel responsible for those other boys, the ones who were killed."
695,00:38:39,00:38:43,Isn't that why you still bring them toys?
696,00:38:43,00:38:46,You were 11 years old.
697,00:38:46,00:38:48,You were a little boy yourself.
698,00:38:48,00:38:50,It wasn't your fault.
699,00:38:50,00:38:53,But they won't let me forget.
700,00:38:53,00:38:55,They blame me.
701,00:38:55,00:38:57,They torment me.
702,00:38:57,00:38:59,And I can't make the voices go away.
703,00:38:59,00:39:01,You were there.
704,00:39:01,00:39:02,You had to have felt them.
705,00:39:04,00:39:07,"Tell us about the ghost hunters, Doug and Carrie."
706,00:39:10,00:39:12,I didn't want them inside.
707,00:39:12,00:39:15,I tried to tell my boss that it was a bad idea.
708,00:39:15,00:39:17,Why was it a bad idea?
709,00:39:17,00:39:18,Because I knew what would happen.
710,00:39:18,00:39:21,I knew that they would learn my secret.
711,00:39:21,00:39:28,I have worked very hard to get past everything that has happened and build a new life.
712,00:39:28,00:39:38,"If they found out, I would lose everything, everything that I have built as Thomas Pope."
713,00:39:38,00:39:40,"But I-I mean, how are they gonna find out?"
714,00:39:40,00:39:41,Who's gonna tell them?
715,00:39:41,00:39:43,From talking to the boys.
716,00:39:43,00:39:46,The ghosts of the boys?
717,00:39:46,00:39:49,I couldn't let them talk to the boys.
718,00:39:54,00:39:55,Hey.
719,00:39:55,00:39:57,Hey.
720,00:39:57,00:39:58,Do you have a minute?
721,00:39:58,00:39:59,I do.
722,00:40:01,00:40:06,"Uh... back before I came to Vegas, I worked up in San Francisco."
723,00:40:06,00:40:09,I helped put away this guy-- true sociopath.
724,00:40:09,00:40:14,"He posed as a cop, pull women over at night, sadistically assault them."
725,00:40:14,00:40:16,We found 17 victims.
726,00:40:16,00:40:17,I suspect there were more.
727,00:40:17,00:40:19,"You're talking about Lyle Brinks, right?"
728,00:40:19,00:40:22,Yeah. I had no idea you were a part of that.
729,00:40:24,00:40:25,He's up for parole.
730,00:40:25,00:40:31,The cop that I worked with-- she's worried that he actually stands a chance of release.
731,00:40:31,00:40:33,Okay. What can I do?
732,00:40:33,00:40:34,I need a few days.
733,00:40:34,00:40:36,I-I... I want to be there.
734,00:40:36,00:40:39,"I want to testify, make sure that doesn't happen."
735,00:40:39,00:40:45,"I understand. You got it... but, you know, while you're up there, do me a favor."
736,00:40:45,00:40:46,"You know, take some time off."
737,00:40:46,00:40:48,It's been a rough couple of months.
738,00:40:48,00:40:50,You deserve it.
739,00:40:50,00:40:53,(laughs)
740,00:40:53,00:40:55,Okay.
741,00:40:55,00:40:57,Hey.
742,00:40:57,00:40:59,Great job today.
743,00:40:59,00:41:02,That must have been really scary.
744,00:41:02,00:41:07,"I'll tell you, when I heard that laughing, I sure as hell wasn't laughing."
745,00:41:07,00:41:09,(laughs)
746,00:41:09,00:41:15,"You know, I... I think I owe you an apology from earlier, implying that you were crazy."
747,00:41:15,00:41:23,"You know, as much as this is our universe, surrounded by science every day, I still like to think there's room for a spiritual side."
748,00:41:23,00:41:28,"Well, no apology necessary, but it's accepted."
749,00:41:28,00:41:31,"Thank you. But who knows? I mean, maybe you're right."
750,00:41:31,00:41:32,Maybe this whole thing is crazy.
751,00:41:32,00:41:34,What? Why you saying that now?
752,00:41:34,00:41:53,"Well, when I was at the slaughterhouse with Pope, I was doing everything I could to hear or feel anything from Carrie or the boys, and I mean, there I was with the killer standing right behind me, and none of them bothered to send up a signal, or a-a single ghostly warning sign?"
753,00:41:53,00:41:54,(laughing): Yeah.
754,00:41:54,00:41:56,"Yeah, you would think, right?"
755,00:41:59,00:42:02,But I think...
756,00:42:02,00:42:05,someone was looking out for you.
757,00:42:05,00:42:08,You made it out of there okay.
758,00:42:08,00:42:10,(sighs)
759,00:42:10,00:42:12,Let me buy you breakfast.
760,00:42:12,00:42:15,Deal.
761,00:42:15,00:42:17,But I'm driving.
762,00:42:17,00:42:19,Of course you are.
763,00:42:29,00:42:31,Let's go.
764,00:42:31,00:42:32,(locker door creaking)
