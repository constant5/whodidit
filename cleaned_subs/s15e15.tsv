0	00:00:25	00:00:26	Hey, old man.
1	00:00:26	00:00:28	What the hell are you doing in my alley?
2	00:00:28	00:00:31	This... this isn't your alley.
3	00:00:31	00:00:33	What, you trying to tell me that it's yours?
4	00:00:33	00:00:34	Why are you doing this?
5	00:00:34	00:00:35	I'm just trying to have some fun.
6	00:00:35	00:00:37	Ain't you having fun?
7	00:00:41	00:00:44	Please, just let me be, please.
8	00:00:44	00:00:45	Is that the best you got?
9	00:00:52	00:00:54	Leave him alone!
10	00:00:55	00:00:56	Who's there?
11	00:00:56	00:00:58	Get that damn light out of my eyes.
12	00:00:58	00:00:59	You want to pick on someone?
13	00:00:59	00:01:03	Why don't you pick on someone who can fight back?
14	00:01:03	00:01:04	I said, turn off that damn light.
15	00:01:04	00:01:06	Forget it, man.
16	00:01:08	00:01:09	Who the hell are you?
17	00:01:09	00:01:11	I'm a guy who's sick of you trashing this neighborhood.
18	00:01:11	00:01:15	Well, if you're gonna do something about it, why don't you hurry up and do it?
19	00:01:18	00:01:19	Let's go.
20	00:01:24	00:01:26	Morning.
21	00:01:26	00:01:27	What's going on, Mitch?
22	00:01:27	00:01:31	One of the owners who backs on the alley was taking out trash this morning.
23	00:01:31	00:01:33	He made the find.
24	00:01:36	00:01:38	Oof.
25	00:01:43	00:01:45	Somebody worked him over pretty good.
26	00:01:45	00:01:50	Judging by his knuckles, I'd say he got a few shots in.
27	00:01:51	00:01:53	Eh.
28	00:01:53	00:01:59	Ground is sticky over here, probably thanks to this Dumpster.
29	00:01:59	00:02:01	But it's given us a lot of shoe impressions.
30	00:02:01	00:02:04	Looking at the number, I'd say more than one assailant.
31	00:02:04	00:02:09	Well, Mitch did say there was a gang terrorizing the neighborhood lately.
32	00:02:09	00:02:13	Mostly vandalism and burglaries, but maybe they stepped up their game to murder.
33	00:02:18	00:02:19	Nice get-up.
34	00:02:19	00:02:21	Is that a cape?
35	00:02:21	00:02:23	That's a costume of some sort.
36	00:02:23	00:02:29	And, of course, no costume would be complete without a mask.
37	00:02:29	00:02:32	Maybe he was one of those sidewalk characters over on the Strip.
38	00:02:32	00:02:34	They dress up like superheroes and panhandle for money.
39	00:02:34	00:02:37	Yeah, and was walking home and just got jumped?
40	00:02:37	00:02:38	Mmm?
41	00:02:38	00:02:41	One of my guys found this in a doorway up the street.
42	00:02:41	00:02:43	No ID.
43	00:02:43	00:02:44	Looks like it's been rifled through.
44	00:02:44	00:02:46	Got some street clothes...
45	00:02:46	00:02:47	and a sketch pad.
46	00:02:52	00:02:53	Uh...
47	00:02:53	00:02:55	Yeah.
48	00:02:55	00:02:57	Take a look at these.
49	00:02:59	00:03:02	Comic drawings of a superhero.
50	00:03:03	00:03:05	That's this superhero.
51	00:03:07	00:03:09	Battling a gang.
52	00:03:09	00:03:11	It's a little weirdly prophetic, isn't it?
53	00:03:11	00:03:14	Like he knew he was gonna come up against these guys.
54	00:03:14	00:03:16	Like he knew the future.
55	00:03:16	00:03:20	Too bad for him, the hero only wins in comic books.
56	00:03:59	00:04:02	Hey, uh, quite a collection of lifts.
57	00:04:02	00:04:05	Yeah, looks like at least five or six different individuals, plus the victim.
58	00:04:05	00:04:10	And a bare foot? What's with that? I don't know, but he was definitely part of the mix somehow.
59	00:04:10	00:04:11	What do you got?
60	00:04:11	00:04:14	I think these are the victim's superpowers.
61	00:04:14	00:04:18	One stun gun, spent, no charge left, and a pepper spray...
62	00:04:19	00:04:21	...also empty.
63	00:04:21	00:04:23	Hey, Nick. Got a minute?
64	00:04:24	00:04:25	What's up, Super Dave?
65	00:04:25	00:04:29	Well, I'm gonna say time of death 00 a.m.
66	00:04:29	00:04:31	Multiple bruises and contusions.
67	00:04:31	00:04:33	Several lacerations.
68	00:04:33	00:04:36	I can't hazard a guess to say which ultimately killed him, though.
69	00:04:36	00:04:37	Find any ID?
70	00:04:37	00:04:39	No. Nothing.
71	00:04:39	00:04:42	Leave it to a superhero to keep his identity a mystery.
72	00:04:42	00:04:43	Can I get my cart, please?
73	00:04:45	00:04:47	Can I get my cart?
74	00:04:47	00:04:50	I said, be patient, okay?
75	00:04:50	00:04:52	Please.
76	00:04:55	00:04:58	Mmm. Mmm.
77	00:04:58	00:05:02	Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
78	00:05:02	00:05:04	How's your sandwich, Roger?
79	00:05:04	00:05:05	Oh...
80	00:05:05	00:05:07	Good, yes. Thanks.
81	00:05:07	00:05:09	You said size 11.
82	00:05:09	00:05:11	They're not entirely new.
83	00:05:11	00:05:13	They're from our lost-and-found, but they're something.
84	00:05:13	00:05:14	Thank you. You're welcome.
85	00:05:17	00:05:21	They're, uh... not entirely free, though, either.
86	00:05:21	00:05:24	I need to know what happened in the alley last night.
87	00:05:24	00:05:27	You were there, weren't you?
88	00:05:27	00:05:29	Some guy...
89	00:05:29	00:05:32	who looked like Batman...
90	00:05:34	00:05:36	...he saved me.
91	00:05:36	00:05:37	How did he save you, exactly?
92	00:05:37	00:05:41	I was, uh, rummaging.
93	00:05:41	00:05:46	All of a sudden, I'm surrounded by these, um... villains.
94	00:05:46	00:05:49	And they start shoving and hitting me.
95	00:05:49	00:05:51	What did these villains look like?
96	00:05:51	00:05:52	Never saw them.
97	00:05:52	00:05:54	They-they covered their faces.
98	00:05:54	00:05:59	But they wanted to hurt me.
99	00:05:59	00:06:01	Badly.
100	00:06:03	00:06:09	That's when the guy in the mask appeared, in a ball of light.
101	00:06:09	00:06:10	I see.
102	00:06:10	00:06:12	What happened next?
103	00:06:12	00:06:13	I don't... I don't know.
104	00:06:13	00:06:15	I left. I took off.
105	00:06:15	00:06:17	You didn't see their faces.
106	00:06:17	00:06:19	You didn't see what happened.
107	00:06:19	00:06:23	Did you see anything at all that-that might help us?
108	00:06:23	00:06:25	Find the villains, I mean.
109	00:06:25	00:06:27	A truck.
110	00:06:29	00:06:31	A red pickup.
111	00:06:31	00:06:32	Um, parked in the alley.
112	00:06:36	00:06:38	How's it going?
113	00:06:38	00:06:40	Any luck?
114	00:06:40	00:06:41	Some.
115	00:06:41	00:06:44	I was able to identify two of the boots that made these impressions.
116	00:06:44	00:06:50	Unfortunately, they're all common work boots, sold at dozens of retailers and online.
117	00:06:50	00:06:52	But we may have some luck in a different way.
118	00:06:52	00:06:54	Take a close look.
119	00:06:54	00:06:57	There are granules stuck in the gel.
120	00:06:57	00:06:59	Almost like... coffee grounds.
121	00:06:59	00:07:04	Sara said that the ground around the crime scene was... was sticky.
122	00:07:04	00:07:07	Maybe the tackiness pulled whatever this is off of this guy's shoes.
123	00:07:07	00:07:08	Not just his.
124	00:07:08	00:07:11	Almost all of these have the exact same trace on them.
125	00:07:11	00:07:14	I already pulled a sample and gave it to Hodges for analysis.
126	00:07:14	00:07:16	Hey, Russell, you should, uh, see this.
127	00:07:16	00:07:19	It's, uh, security footage from a pawnshop on Wallace.
128	00:07:19	00:07:21	Just a few blocks from the murder.
129	00:07:30	00:07:33	Wow, they don't waste any time.
130	00:07:33	00:07:34	00.
131	00:07:34	00:07:36	Only an hour or so before the murder.
132	00:07:36	00:07:40	Looks like this gang had a busy night.
133	00:07:44	00:07:46	The owner already started cleaning up inside.
134	00:07:46	00:07:49	So I told him not to touch anything until we're finished.
135	00:07:49	00:07:53	Well, according to Akers, this is the second time these guys have hit this place.
136	00:07:53	00:07:58	They did the same thing to a beauty supply store a block down, a couple nights ago.
137	00:07:58	00:07:59	So they're targeting the same area.
138	00:07:59	00:08:01	Gotta be local.
139	00:08:01	00:08:04	Maybe a gang of neighborhood kids out wilding?
140	00:08:04	00:08:06	Wilding... now killing.
141	00:08:06	00:08:07	Got any shoe impressions?
142	00:08:09	00:08:10	Working on it.
143	00:08:10	00:08:11	What is that powder?
144	00:08:11	00:08:15	Oh, the, uh, display has fluorescent lights.
145	00:08:15	00:08:18	And the inside of the tubes is coated with this phosphor powder.
146	00:08:18	00:08:20	When the tube breaks, the powder gets everywhere.
147	00:08:20	00:08:21	Any point in, uh...
148	00:08:21	00:08:23	dusting for prints? Not sure.
149	00:08:23	00:08:26	Video was pretty grainy, but it looked like they were wearing gloves.
150	00:08:26	00:08:29	Besides, they took almost everything they touched.
151	00:08:33	00:08:34	Maybe we don't need any prints.
152	00:08:42	00:08:44	I got blood.
153	00:08:50	00:08:52	I wear a mask.
154	00:08:52	00:08:57	And that mask, it's not to hide who I am, but to create what I am.
155	00:08:57	00:08:58	I give up.
156	00:08:58	00:09:00	Are-are you quoting Sun Tzu?
157	00:09:00	00:09:02	Uh, no, no, no. A different warrior.
158	00:09:02	00:09:04	Batman. Volume one.
159	00:09:04	00:09:07	Number 624.
160	00:09:07	00:09:08	What're you doing?
161	00:09:08	00:09:10	Oh, I'm just trying to see your feet.
162	00:09:10	00:09:13	The last Batman fan I met was shoeless and lives in an alley.
163	00:09:13	00:09:20	You know, I never pegged you for a comic book nerd. My early teens, every dime I had went to comic books.
164	00:09:20	00:09:21	I guess I just don't get it. You know?
165	00:09:21	00:09:24	My childhood, fantasy was never my escape.
166	00:09:24	00:09:26	I lost myself in science and numbers.
167	00:09:26	00:09:28	That's all I needed, I guess.
168	00:09:28	00:09:31	Well, you liked things that were clear and proven.
169	00:09:31	00:09:32	Right or wrong.
170	00:09:32	00:09:34	Black or white. Maybe.
171	00:09:34	00:09:38	This is the closest that I've come to the comic book world, and it's ample enough.
172	00:09:38	00:09:42	Do you realize how long walnuts have been around as a food source?
173	00:09:42	00:09:49	Archeologists in Southern France found evidence of roasted walnut shells dating back to the Neolithic period.
174	00:09:49	00:09:51	That's 8,000 years ago.
175	00:09:51	00:09:53	(shell cracks) Wow.
176	00:09:53	00:09:54	I did not know that.
177	00:09:54	00:09:55	Thank you very much.
178	00:09:55	00:09:58	And you're telling us this because...?
179	00:09:58	00:10:03	Well, because the trace evidence collected at the scene, the granules on the suspects' shoes...
180	00:10:03	00:10:06	it's ground walnut shell.
181	00:10:06	00:10:08	Now, it's not as exotic as it sounds.
182	00:10:08	00:10:11	It's commonly used as reptile bedding, if you raise reptiles.
183	00:10:11	00:10:15	They're also used as exfoliants in soaps and scrubs.
184	00:10:15	00:10:16	So it's common stuff.
185	00:10:16	00:10:18	Not gonna help us very much now, right?
186	00:10:18	00:10:19	Not necessarily.
187	00:10:19	00:10:23	Our samples are unique in that they are unusually charred.
188	00:10:23	00:10:26	They also contain a trace of calcium hypochlorite.
189	00:10:26	00:10:28	I'm still working to determine why.
190	00:10:28	00:10:29	Good, good.
191	00:10:29	00:10:30	Go.
192	00:10:30	00:10:31	Work.
193	00:10:34	00:10:35	Hey. (both grunting)
194	00:10:35	00:10:36	Oh, lord.
195	00:10:36	00:10:38	I need a revolving door around here.
196	00:10:38	00:10:40	Results from the blood Finlay found at the pawnshop.
197	00:10:40	00:10:42	Uh, DNA was male.
198	00:10:42	00:10:44	No direct match in CODIS.
199	00:10:44	00:10:47	But there was a familial match to this guy.
200	00:10:47	00:10:49	Martin Preach.
201	00:10:49	00:10:53	Three-striker currently residing at Ely State Prison.
202	00:10:53	00:10:54	I did some checking.
203	00:10:54	00:10:55	Mr. Preach has at least one kid.
204	00:10:55	00:10:58	A 19-year-old son named Trey.
205	00:10:58	00:11:01	A couple of petty offenses of his own.
206	00:11:01	00:11:02	Could be the blood donor.
207	00:11:02	00:11:05	Was one of his petty offenses his hair?
208	00:11:05	00:11:08	Wait a second.
209	00:11:08	00:11:09	Uh, look at the victim's comic book drawings.
210	00:11:09	00:11:12	The gang that the superhero is fighting.
211	00:11:12	00:11:15	One of them has a purple mohawk.
212	00:11:18	00:11:20	Pow!
213	00:11:24	00:11:27	Like father, like son, I guess. Right, Trey?
214	00:11:27	00:11:29	It's not much of a surprise.
215	00:11:29	00:11:32	Your dad wasn't exactly around during your formative years, was he?
216	00:11:33	00:11:35	I got a family I can count on.
217	00:11:35	00:11:37	That's all that matters.
218	00:11:37	00:11:39	Yeah, you got your boys, right? Your-your gang?
219	00:11:39	00:11:42	It's one for all, you know?
220	00:11:42	00:11:47	Well, I hate to break up the little party here, Trey, but you guys are in it pretty deep this time.
221	00:11:47	00:11:50	You left DNA on the window at the pawnshop last night.
222	00:11:50	00:11:55	As we're sitting here, our guy is outside matching it to the sample that you gave in the hall.
223	00:11:55	00:11:58	You ain't a juvie no more, man, and this is far from your first offense.
224	00:11:58	00:12:01	So... I suggest you smarten up.
225	00:12:01	00:12:03	The D.A.'s gonna want your whole crew.
226	00:12:03	00:12:04	All of them, all right?
227	00:12:04	00:12:10	You give us the names and a serious statement, and this murder does not have to be all on you.
228	00:12:10	00:12:12	Hold on. What murder?
229	00:12:12	00:12:15	The guy you beat to death in the alley off Grant last night.
230	00:12:15	00:12:16	That murder.
231	00:12:16	00:12:18	I don't know nothing about that.
232	00:12:18	00:12:22	You don't know nothing about this?
233	00:12:22	00:12:24	Wait a minute.
234	00:12:24	00:12:25	This dude?
235	00:12:25	00:12:27	He's the one that's dead?
236	00:12:27	00:12:30	I've seen this freak around.
237	00:12:30	00:12:32	He wears a mask or something, right?
238	00:12:32	00:12:36	Uh-huh. Yeah, I see him sometimes when I cruise at night.
239	00:12:36	00:12:38	Sad damn freak.
240	00:12:39	00:12:42	But I didn't kill him though.
241	00:12:44	00:12:45	I didn't touch him.
242	00:12:50	00:12:52	Just heard from Nick.
243	00:12:52	00:12:55	Trey Preach and his purple hair deny any involvement with the murder.
244	00:12:55	00:12:57	No shocker, I guess.
245	00:12:57	00:12:58	No, shocker would've been if he didn't deny it.
246	00:12:58	00:13:00	Well...
247	00:13:00	00:13:01	no problem holding him.
248	00:13:01	00:13:04	The guy's a lock for the smash and grab at the pawnshop.
249	00:13:04	00:13:08	The problem is that may be the only thing that he's a lock for.
250	00:13:08	00:13:10	What do you mean?
251	00:13:10	00:13:15	So, the shoe prints from the pawnshop don't match the shoe prints from the alley.
252	00:13:15	00:13:17	You sure about that?
253	00:13:17	00:13:22	Unless these guys went home and changed shoes in between crimes, we're looking at different gangs.
254	00:13:22	00:13:25	Two gangs working the same neighborhood?
255	00:13:25	00:13:28	And what about the comic book drawings?
256	00:13:28	00:13:32	No, no, no. There-there can't be that many guys out there with purple mohawks.
257	00:13:33	00:13:36	Don't we know somebody that-that saw the gang in the alley?
258	00:13:36	00:13:38	The homeless guy, Roger.
259	00:13:38	00:13:40	But he said he didn't remember seeing any faces.
260	00:13:40	00:13:42	That's what he said, but let-let's find him.
261	00:13:42	00:13:44	Show him a picture of Trey and his purple hair.
262	00:13:44	00:13:46	Maybe he saw more than he realized.
263	00:13:52	00:13:59	Maybe he decided it was too high crime an area, and picked up and moved out You know what? I'm gonna go back to the other side, have one more look.
264	00:13:59	00:14:01	Then we should check the alley north of Grant.
265	00:14:01	00:14:03	Okay.
266	00:14:22	00:14:24	Roger?
267	00:14:24	00:14:27	We just want to talk to you. Hey!
268	00:14:27	00:14:30	Hey, who's there?! (movement nearby)
269	00:14:32	00:14:35	Hey! Hey!
270	00:14:36	00:14:38	What the hell?
271	00:14:39	00:14:40	Who are you?
272	00:14:40	00:14:41	Hey! Okay!
273	00:14:41	00:14:43	I'm with the LVPD Crime Lab.
274	00:14:43	00:14:44	I need you to step back.
275	00:14:44	00:14:45	Just stay back!
276	00:14:48	00:14:52	Unless you're faster than a speeding bullet, you better do what she said.
277	00:14:59	00:15:02	Why were you in the alley? We got every right to be there.
278	00:15:02	00:15:03	We haven't done anything wrong.
279	00:15:03	00:15:07	All right, for starters, how about you take off your masks?
280	00:15:07	00:15:09	Unless you have something to hide.
281	00:15:09	00:15:12	We're not hiding anything. We're just protecting ourselves.
282	00:15:12	00:15:15	Anonymity is vital to our work.
283	00:15:15	00:15:16	To what we do.
284	00:15:17	00:15:19	Which is what exactly?
285	00:15:19	00:15:20	We fight crime.
286	00:15:20	00:15:22	We patrol the streets at night.
287	00:15:22	00:15:28	We do whatever we got to do to make it tougher on the pimps and the drug dealers and whatever other criminals we find.
288	00:15:28	00:15:30	Okay, we're on the same side here.
289	00:15:30	00:15:32	The guy who was beaten in this alley last night?
290	00:15:32	00:15:36	Judging from his costume, I'm guessing he was a friend of yours?
291	00:15:37	00:15:39	Dominion was beaten? By who?
292	00:15:39	00:15:40	Where is he?
293	00:15:40	00:15:42	He's dead.
294	00:15:42	00:15:45	You didn't know?
295	00:15:51	00:15:52	How did it happen?
296	00:15:52	00:15:54	Well, we're working to figure it out.
297	00:15:54	00:15:58	And it would help if you could tell us when was the last time you saw him?
298	00:15:58	00:16:05	Dominion didn't show up for patrol last night, so when he didn't show up again tonight, we decided to go looking for him and that's when we saw you two entering the alley.
299	00:16:05	00:16:07	What was Dominion's real name?
300	00:16:08	00:16:11	Your friend is lying in a morgue.
301	00:16:11	00:16:14	An unclaimed John Doe with a toe tag.
302	00:16:14	00:16:16	Tell us his name so we can at least notify his family.
303	00:16:19	00:16:21	Brad Jeffries.
304	00:16:25	00:16:27	All Brad ever wanted to do was help people.
305	00:16:27	00:16:29	I know it sounds trite, but...
306	00:16:29	00:16:36	ever since he was ten, right after his father died, he became obsessed with...
307	00:16:36	00:16:38	fairness.
308	00:16:38	00:16:41	He insisted that everything had be fair.
309	00:16:41	00:16:46	That's when he got lost in the comic book world and this online role-playing.
310	00:16:46	00:16:48	How long had he been doing this?
311	00:16:48	00:16:51	Dressing up and going on, uh, patrol with his friends?
312	00:16:51	00:16:53	The real-life superhero movement?
313	00:16:53	00:16:55	That's what they call it.
314	00:16:55	00:16:58	Uh, they've been doing it for probably ten months now.
315	00:16:58	00:17:03	Did he ever mention any problems or run-ins they might've had?
316	00:17:03	00:17:08	Any enemies they could've made? He would've knew better than to talk to us about it.
317	00:17:08	00:17:11	It would only worry me that much more.
318	00:17:11	00:17:13	And it only aggravated Seth.
319	00:17:13	00:17:15	You weren't a fan of what he was doing?
320	00:17:15	00:17:18	I was afraid of exactly this.
321	00:17:18	00:17:23	I mean, I war... I warned him I don't know how many times that they were playing a dangerous game.
322	00:17:23	00:17:26	It's not comic book land out there.
323	00:17:26	00:17:30	It's the real world. People have guns and knives.
324	00:17:30	00:17:32	He said it was his calling.
325	00:17:32	00:17:35	That it gave meaning to his life.
326	00:17:35	00:17:36	How can you argue with that?
327	00:17:36	00:17:39	No, I understand. Um...
328	00:17:39	00:17:43	his two partners-- Tina and Scott?
329	00:17:43	00:17:44	How-how well do you know them?
330	00:17:44	00:17:46	Well.
331	00:17:46	00:17:48	They're here all the time.
332	00:17:48	00:17:50	They hang out in the basement.
333	00:17:50	00:17:52	They were his best friends.
334	00:17:52	00:17:57	They would never have anything to do with his death if that's what you're thinking.
335	00:17:58	00:18:04	So, Brad's mom doesn't have a problem with you guys setting up in her basement?
336	00:18:04	00:18:07	I mean, Brad was the one who brought the three of us together.
337	00:18:07	00:18:09	You know? Like, inspired us.
338	00:18:09	00:18:13	He got me believing I could actually make a difference.
339	00:18:13	00:18:14	And change the world, you know?
340	00:18:14	00:18:16	But why like this?
341	00:18:16	00:18:19	The masks, costumes?
342	00:18:19	00:18:21	Well, we have our reasons.
343	00:18:21	00:18:22	For me?
344	00:18:22	00:18:25	I was a victim once.
345	00:18:25	00:18:29	Just a 17-year-old girl, riding the bus late at night.
346	00:18:29	00:18:30	Yeah, I was never a victim.
347	00:18:30	00:18:33	But I was into some pretty dark stuff in the past.
348	00:18:33	00:18:35	Hurt people.
349	00:18:35	00:18:37	What I do now, it's my way to pay it back.
350	00:18:38	00:18:38	It's my redemption.
351	00:18:38	00:18:41	But you're not police officers.
352	00:18:41	00:18:43	You don't have police training.
353	00:18:43	00:18:46	You don't have the power to even arrest anybody.
354	00:18:46	00:18:48	What you're doing is borderline unlawful.
355	00:18:48	00:18:48	You know that, right?
356	00:18:48	00:18:49	So, what do we do?
357	00:18:49	00:18:50	We-we leave it up to the cops?
358	00:18:50	00:18:51	Is that it?
359	00:18:51	00:18:52	Well, there's an idea, yeah.
360	00:18:52	00:18:54	Cops go where the money is.
361	00:18:54	00:18:56	The casinos, the tourists.
362	00:18:56	00:18:58	We aren't exactly a priority.
363	00:18:58	00:19:00	So, that's why we do what we do.
364	00:19:00	00:19:01	Come here and take a look at this.
365	00:19:03	00:19:05	Tell me about the gang this superhero's fighting.
366	00:19:05	00:19:08	Yeah, we call them The Disciples.
367	00:19:08	00:19:10	They've been running wild around this area for about a month now.
368	00:19:10	00:19:12	They're sort of our nemesis.
369	00:19:12	00:19:16	The drawing was Brad's version of what would happen if he found them.
370	00:19:16	00:19:18	These are the rest of Brad's drawings over here?
371	00:19:18	00:19:20	Yeah.
372	00:19:30	00:19:34	What's this one about?
373	00:19:34	00:19:38	Just some guy we ran into one night. Why?
374	00:19:38	00:19:42	Witnesses saw a red pickup truck last night around the time Brad was murdered.
375	00:19:42	00:19:44	What can you tell me about it?
376	00:19:44	00:19:46	Guy was arguing with a hooker.
377	00:19:46	00:19:47	Shoved her down.
378	00:19:47	00:19:53	So we intervened. When he tried to bail, Brad smashed the fender of his truck.
379	00:19:53	00:19:54	Know anything about the driver?
380	00:19:56	00:19:57	Have you seen him before or since then?
381	00:19:57	00:20:00	No. Just that night.
382	00:20:00	00:20:01	Okay. That's it?
383	00:20:01	00:20:03	Yeah, that's it.
384	00:20:05	00:20:07	Hey. Hey!
385	00:20:07	00:20:12	You know, I had no idea this was actually a thing-- this whole, real-life superhero movement.
386	00:20:12	00:20:14	More than just our trio, you mean?
387	00:20:14	00:20:23	Way more. I have found hundreds of people across the country, who like to dress in superhero costumes and go out in their neighborhoods, mostly it seems with altruistic motives.
388	00:20:23	00:20:28	I'm all for making a difference, but the whole dress up part just seems so...
389	00:20:28	00:20:29	What's the word I'm looking for?
390	00:20:29	00:20:30	Hello, ladies.
391	00:20:30	00:20:34	I bring news on our walnut shells.
392	00:20:34	00:20:37	Now, you remember that I said they were unique?
393	00:20:37	00:20:38	You said they were charred, right?
394	00:20:38	00:20:40	And also that they'd been exposed to calcium hypochlorite.
395	00:20:40	00:20:43	And all that just might equal...
396	00:20:43	00:20:44	Sundip Pool Supply.
397	00:20:44	00:20:46	Might equal, how?
398	00:20:46	00:20:50	Turns out, ground walnut shell is also used by sandblasters to clean pool tile.
399	00:20:50	00:20:55	They spray it instead of sand because the shells don't scratch the tile.
400	00:20:55	00:20:56	And how does that get us to this Sundip place?
401	00:20:56	00:20:58	The charring and the chemical trace.
402	00:20:58	00:21:01	Sundip Pool Supply had a huge fire about three weeks ago.
403	00:21:01	00:21:06	It's the only logical source I can think of that matches our specific samples.
404	00:21:06	00:21:08	Thanks, Hodges, I'll check it out.
405	00:21:16	00:21:17	Hey, Doc.
406	00:21:17	00:21:19	Long day for you.
407	00:21:19	00:21:24	Long and busy with some very interesting findings, particularly in the case of your victim.
408	00:21:24	00:21:26	Really? What have you got?
409	00:21:26	00:21:31	Well, as you can see in his injuries here, there's a lot of bruising and swelling as well as areas of bleeding.
410	00:21:31	00:21:34	All of this is consistent with a non-lethal beating.
411	00:21:34	00:21:36	Non-lethal?
412	00:21:36	00:21:36	And yet he's dead.
413	00:21:36	00:21:41	Thanks to a single blow that landed just here at the base of the skull.
414	00:21:41	00:21:48	The victim was struck once with significant force, effectively transecting the brain stem in the area of the medulla oblongata.
415	00:21:48	00:21:57	Okay, so maybe during the beating, one of the suspects gets carried away, hits the victim in the base of the skull, and kills him.
416	00:21:57	00:21:59	But herein lies the conundrum.
417	00:21:59	00:22:01	All this bruising and swelling you see took time.
418	00:22:01	00:22:06	At least 60 minutes for the body to respond to injuries of this degree.
419	00:22:06	00:22:09	The brain stem injury, however, was instantly fatal.
420	00:22:09	00:22:11	Instantly?
421	00:22:11	00:22:13	Like switching off a light.
422	00:22:13	00:22:18	So the blow that killed him was delivered 60 minutes after the beating.
423	00:22:18	00:22:24	That means that Brad Jeffries was beaten up and left in the alley for at least an hour.
424	00:22:24	00:22:26	According to Doc, probably unconscious.
425	00:22:26	00:22:34	So somebody had to come back, maybe a gang member or someone entirely different, hit him in the back of the head, and killed him.
426	00:22:34	00:22:36	Does Doc have any thoughts about the murder weapon?
427	00:22:36	00:22:41	Said it could be something like a baseball bat or a club.
428	00:22:41	00:22:44	But here you can see these bands on his neck.
429	00:22:46	00:22:48	Wait a second.
430	00:22:48	00:22:54	Nick just came back with some more comic book drawings from our superheroes.
431	00:22:54	00:22:57	Check out the weapon in that hero's hands.
432	00:22:57	00:22:59	It's a club with metal bands.
433	00:22:59	00:23:03	Right, so maybe our victim was killed with his own weapon.
434	00:23:03	00:23:07	Well, there was nothing like this recovered at the crime scene, so the killer must have taken it.
435	00:23:07	00:23:10	All right, so he either still has it, or he ditched it.
436	00:23:10	00:23:12	There are a lot of Dumpsters in those alleys.
437	00:23:12	00:23:15	Let's get LVPD to check the area completely, okay?
438	00:23:17	00:23:20	Hey, looks like that ground walnut shell trace might have paid off.
439	00:23:20	00:23:24	Thanks to Hodges, I went and checked out this place called Sundip Pool Supply.
440	00:23:24	00:23:28	Their place is all fenced and boarded up, but I got a security guard to let me in.
441	00:23:28	00:23:31	There was charred walnut shell, just like ours, all over the place.
442	00:23:31	00:23:34	So our gang must've been there at some point before they went to the alley.
443	00:23:34	00:23:40	Guard said that the only people working there right now are the demolition crew, Company name is Agrerro Demo and Hauling.
444	00:23:40	00:23:48	They are in there every day, and this is the kicker, the crew's foreman, Tony Agrerro, he drives a red pickup truck.
445	00:23:58	00:23:59	Okay, boys.
446	00:23:59	00:24:04	This is the guy we're looking for right here, Tony Agrerro.
447	00:24:04	00:24:07	You're sure he's here? Well, he better be, that's his red pickup truck right there.
448	00:24:07	00:24:09	Let's go.
449	00:24:15	00:24:16	Yeah.
450	00:24:16	00:24:18	There's the dent right there.
451	00:24:23	00:24:24	Hey, Nick.
452	00:24:24	00:24:26	Ground walnut shells.
453	00:24:26	00:24:29	Same as on the boots from the alley.
454	00:24:31	00:24:32	Do you hear that?
455	00:24:45	00:24:47	It's still warm.
456	00:24:47	00:24:48	He's got to be around here.
457	00:24:52	00:24:54	Keys are still in the ignition.
458	00:24:55	00:24:57	Oh, Nick.
459	00:24:58	00:24:59	Lot of blood.
460	00:25:01	00:25:02	Whoa.
461	00:25:03	00:25:05	Mitchell, over here!
462	00:25:10	00:25:11	Well, we found him.
463	00:25:13	00:25:14	Looks like somebody had an accident.
464	00:25:16	00:25:18	If this was an accident, I'm Superman.
465	00:25:30	00:25:31	Hey, Nick.
466	00:25:31	00:25:32	Yeah?
467	00:25:32	00:25:34	There are tool marks on one of these pulleys.
468	00:25:34	00:25:38	Looks like somebody intentionally jammed the winch cable.
469	00:25:38	00:25:41	Yeah, they probably knew the victim would crawl into the gap to fix it.
470	00:25:41	00:25:45	Yeah, and then once he was in there, pulled the lever, and squish.
471	00:25:45	00:25:48	Victim has a couple nasty bruises on his face.
472	00:25:48	00:25:49	Yeah, yeah, I saw those.
473	00:25:49	00:25:51	Looks like he got into a fistfight.
474	00:25:51	00:25:53	How old do you think those bruises are, David?
475	00:25:53	00:25:54	Recent.
476	00:25:54	00:25:56	I don't know-- 24, 48 hours maybe?
477	00:25:56	00:26:02	That times out perfectly for the brawl in the alley, so maybe our dead superhero really did get some licks in before they took him down.
478	00:26:02	00:26:10	All right, so we've got a red pickup truck, walnut shells, we have bruises now, so Tony Agrerro here was definitely a part of the gang that beat up Brad Jeffries.
479	00:26:10	00:26:13	Yeah, I think so, and then used his coworkers as the rest of the crew.
480	00:26:13	00:26:18	Well, that'll give us the alley gang, but it's not gonna tell us who actually went back to commit the murder.
481	00:26:18	00:26:22	Guys, there are some interesting scratches on this truck.
482	00:26:24	00:26:25	(camera shutter clicking Are they fresh?
483	00:26:25	00:26:27	They didn't have time to rust.
484	00:26:27	00:26:29	Weren't the other two superheroes...
485	00:26:29	00:26:32	were they wearing spiked armbands?
486	00:26:32	00:26:34	Who, Scott and Tina? Yeah.
487	00:26:34	00:26:35	Yeah, they were.
488	00:26:35	00:26:38	So, uh, maybe they did this.
489	00:26:38	00:26:39	Case of revenge.
490	00:26:40	00:26:41	Time of death, David?
491	00:26:41	00:26:45	I'm gonna put T.O.D. at around midnight last night, more or less.
492	00:26:45	00:26:47	Midnight.
493	00:26:47	00:26:51	You know, that's not too long after I talked to those two knuckleheads about that red pickup truck.
494	00:26:57	00:26:59	You lied, Tina.
495	00:26:59	00:27:00	You and Scott.
496	00:27:00	00:27:02	Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?
497	00:27:02	00:27:07	Last night when CSI Stokes was here, he told you about a red pickup that had been spotted near where Brad was killed.
498	00:27:07	00:27:22	Yeah. So what? So when he asked you about the driver, you said that you didn't know anything, but you did know. You knew the driver was Tony Agrerro-- his name's right on the side of the truck. Okay, so maybe we didn't tell CSI-- what, Stokes?-- everything, but, you know, obviously, you found your way to Tony Agrerro.
499	00:27:22	00:27:24	Not before you got to him first.
500	00:27:24	00:27:26	Wait, got to him first? What do you mean?
501	00:27:26	00:27:32	Tony Agrerro is dead, Tina, and we found evidence that at least one of you was there. What?
502	00:27:32	00:27:33	W-Wait. No.
503	00:27:33	00:27:35	That's not what we're about.
504	00:27:35	00:27:38	Okay? Th-The real-life superhero movement is about...
505	00:27:38	00:27:40	asserting a positive influence.
506	00:27:40	00:27:42	It's about...
507	00:27:42	00:27:44	improving the neighborhood.
508	00:27:44	00:27:45	You want to improve your neighborhood?
509	00:27:45	00:27:47	Go help in a shelter.
510	00:27:47	00:27:49	Get involved with at-risk kids.
511	00:27:49	00:27:54	The game that you are playing is dangerous, and now two people are dead because of it.
512	00:27:54	00:27:56	Where were you last night around midnight?
513	00:27:56	00:27:59	I was here, with Brad's mom.
514	00:27:59	00:28:01	We stayed up all night talking.
515	00:28:01	00:28:03	I mean, Brad meant everything to her.
516	00:28:03	00:28:05	All right, she's devastated.
517	00:28:05	00:28:07	I couldn't just leave her.
518	00:28:07	00:28:09	What about Scott?
519	00:28:10	00:28:11	Was he with you?
520	00:28:13	00:28:14	No. Uh... I have...
521	00:28:14	00:28:16	I have no idea where Scott was.
522	00:28:25	00:28:28	You need to tell me where to find Scott, Tina.
523	00:28:28	00:28:29	No games this time.
524	00:28:34	00:28:36	What am I looking at here?
525	00:28:36	00:28:38	Tony Agrerro's trash-hauling crew.
526	00:28:40	00:28:42	they're also his gang from the alley.
527	00:28:42	00:28:43	LVPD rounded them up.
528	00:28:43	00:28:46	Morgan and I offered a deal to the first one to talk.
529	00:28:46	00:28:47	We got four takers.
530	00:28:47	00:28:50	Their stories line up? All of them told the same tale.
531	00:28:50	00:28:52	Agreed to beating up Brad Jeffries in the alley.
532	00:28:52	00:28:55	Anybody say why?
533	00:28:55	00:28:58	Because their boss told them to.
534	00:28:58	00:29:05	Right. Agrerro had that score to settle with the superheroes over the hooker and the damage to his truck.
535	00:29:05	00:29:08	Somehow they knew Jeffries would be walking home from work.
536	00:29:08	00:29:14	They also knew that he couldn't resist playing hero. So the tussle with the homeless guy was just a lure to get Jeffries into the alley.
537	00:29:14	00:29:16	And Jeffries took the bait.
538	00:29:16	00:29:19	But... they left him alive after the beating.
539	00:29:19	00:29:21	They were all big on pressing that point.
540	00:29:21	00:29:23	Right. Well, we knew that.
541	00:29:23	00:29:28	I mean, he was alive for at least an hour later, until one or maybe more of them came back and killed him.
542	00:29:28	00:29:31	Question is, who and why?
543	00:29:31	00:29:32	Well, here's a thought.
544	00:29:32	00:29:36	According to all of them, Agrerro's mask came off during the fight...
545	00:29:36	00:29:38	(grunting) Come on!
546	00:29:39	00:29:41	How does it feel to be a hero?
547	00:29:41	00:29:44	...and Jeffries recognized him.
548	00:29:44	00:29:46	Well, there's a motive for you.
549	00:29:46	00:29:52	After the beating, everybody leaves, Tony starts thinking, Tony starts worrying. Exactly.
550	00:29:52	00:29:56	He knows that if the victim I.D.'s him, he could face serious prison time on the assault.
551	00:29:56	00:29:59	So an hour later, everybody's gone.
552	00:29:59	00:30:01	Agrerro goes back to the alley and kills Jeffries.
553	00:30:02	00:30:04	And then Agrerro is killed by the...
554	00:30:04	00:30:06	the superhero out of revenge.
555	00:30:06	00:30:08	Only problem is...
556	00:30:08	00:30:11	(sighs) Tony Agrerro never went back to the alley.
557	00:30:12	00:30:14	You sure about that?
558	00:30:14	00:30:18	After beating up Jeffries, they all went to nurse their wounds at a local dive bar.
559	00:30:18	00:30:19	I talked to the bartender.
560	00:30:19	00:30:23	Swears all five of them stayed there until close.
561	00:30:23	00:30:25	Agrerro ran a tab and he never left.
562	00:30:25	00:30:30	Well, if that's true, then none of them could have killed Brad Jeffries.
563	00:30:31	00:30:33	Scott...
564	00:30:33	00:30:35	I've been checking on you.
565	00:30:35	00:30:37	You have quite a rap sheet. Congratulations.
566	00:30:37	00:30:43	Almost every charge in here involves you beating the crap out of somebody.
567	00:30:43	00:30:45	That's before I had a cause.
568	00:30:45	00:30:46	You know?
569	00:30:46	00:30:48	Something to believe in.
570	00:30:48	00:30:50	This superhero thing?
571	00:30:50	00:30:53	Yeah. You want to know what I think about that?
572	00:30:53	00:30:57	I think the mask and the cape are just an excuse for you to go out and pound heads.
573	00:30:57	00:31:00	You've always been a thug, only now you do it in a cape.
574	00:31:00	00:31:03	And you tell yourself it's okay because your victims are bad guys.
575	00:31:03	00:31:04	No, man.
576	00:31:04	00:31:06	You got me all wrong, I'm telling you.
577	00:31:06	00:31:10	Tony Agrerro deserved to die, am I right?
578	00:31:10	00:31:17	He killed your best friend, so you did what any noble superhero would do-- you avenged your best friend's death.
579	00:31:17	00:31:19	Only this time, Scott...
580	00:31:19	00:31:24	that's not being a hero right there, man, that's being a vigilante.
581	00:31:24	00:31:27	I... I don't know what you're talking about, man.
582	00:31:27	00:31:28	I didn't have anything to do with that.
583	00:31:28	00:31:30	You weren't there last night?
584	00:31:30	00:31:33	You weren't at the yard? No. Nowhere near it.
585	00:31:33	00:31:41	Then explain how scratches ended up on a truck that perfectly match those bad-ass superhero bracelets of yours.
586	00:31:41	00:31:48	And then maybe you can explain to me how Tony Agrerro's blood ended up on your boot.
587	00:31:52	00:31:54	All right, I... I was there.
588	00:31:55	00:31:57	But he was dead when I found him.
589	00:31:57	00:32:00	I didn't have anything to do with this, I swear.
590	00:32:00	00:32:02	So you were lying before, but you're telling me the truth now?
591	00:32:02	00:32:05	I went looking for him.
592	00:32:05	00:32:07	All right? The place was dark.
593	00:32:07	00:32:08	I heard a truck engine running.
594	00:32:08	00:32:10	I went to go check it out.
595	00:32:10	00:32:12	When I got there, he was laying there, dead.
596	00:32:12	00:32:14	I reached in to check his pulse.
597	00:32:14	00:32:18	That's probably how my arm band scratched the truck. Scott, if you're gonna lie to me, at least get your facts straight.
598	00:32:18	00:32:21	Okay? The keys were in the truck, the engine wasn't running.
599	00:32:24	00:32:26	You want to try again?
600	00:32:26	00:32:27	No.
601	00:32:27	00:32:30	What I want is a lawyer.
602	00:32:30	00:32:32	Now.
603	00:32:32	00:32:34	Hey. How's it going in there?
604	00:32:34	00:32:36	It's not. He lawyered up.
605	00:32:36	00:32:37	Wow, that was fast.
606	00:32:37	00:32:40	Nick got him to admit to being at the scene at the time of the murder.
607	00:32:40	00:32:44	It seemed like he was on the brink of confessing and then he just got smart.
608	00:32:44	00:32:49	You know, the stupid thing is, if this was about avenging the death of his friend, he killed the wrong guy.
609	00:32:49	00:32:50	What do you mean?
610	00:32:50	00:32:54	Tony Agrerro and his crew alibied out for the murder in the alley.
611	00:32:54	00:32:56	Morgan put them in a neighborhood bar at the time.
612	00:32:56	00:32:57	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
613	00:32:57	00:32:59	Then who killed our dead superhero?
614	00:32:59	00:33:00	That is still the question.
615	00:33:00	00:33:03	Hey. One of our officers just brought this in.
616	00:33:03	00:33:07	Matches the description of the weapon you're looking for.
617	00:33:08	00:33:12	Where'd he find it? The guy was threatening some tourist with it, outside the Palermo.
618	00:33:12	00:33:15	I guess they wouldn't acknowledge him as the one, true Batman.
619	00:33:38	00:33:40	Hi, Roger.
620	00:33:42	00:33:44	Do you remember me?
621	00:33:46	00:33:48	You gave me my shoes.
622	00:33:48	00:33:51	I need you to tell me about that club that you were carrying.
623	00:33:52	00:33:54	The club is the source.
624	00:33:54	00:33:55	The club gives me power.
625	00:33:55	00:33:59	I am invincible with the club!
626	00:34:01	00:34:02	Where did you get the club?
627	00:34:02	00:34:06	I... found it.
628	00:34:06	00:34:07	You found it where? In the alley?
629	00:34:07	00:34:10	The one that we were in the other night? No.
630	00:34:10	00:34:11	A different place.
631	00:34:11	00:34:12	Uh, in a Dumpster.
632	00:34:12	00:34:16	Roger, that club belonged to someone.
633	00:34:16	00:34:18	The man that saved you.
634	00:34:18	00:34:19	You said he looked like Batman.
635	00:34:19	00:34:20	You remember?
636	00:34:20	00:34:26	I think that you were there, in the alley, after the fight, after the man with the cape and the mask was hurt.
637	00:34:26	00:34:30	That's where you found the club, isn't it?
638	00:34:30	00:34:31	No. I told you.
639	00:34:31	00:34:32	The club is mine.
640	00:34:32	00:34:34	What happened, Roger?
641	00:34:34	00:34:37	Did he wake up?
642	00:34:37	00:34:39	Did he startle you, scare you?
643	00:34:39	00:34:43	Is that why you hit him?
644	00:34:43	00:34:46	Roger, I need to know exactly what happened.
645	00:34:46	00:34:47	The truth.
646	00:34:47	00:34:50	The club's not his.
647	00:34:50	00:34:51	The club is mine!
648	00:34:56	00:34:59	I found it.
649	00:34:59	00:35:00	In a Dumpster.
650	00:35:00	00:35:02	I don't know which one.
651	00:35:02	00:35:03	There are so many.
652	00:35:03	00:35:05	Give me something then.
653	00:35:05	00:35:07	So I can check your story.
654	00:35:07	00:35:10	A golden star.
655	00:35:10	00:35:12	What do you mean, a golden star?
656	00:35:13	00:35:15	That's it.
657	00:35:15	00:35:17	A golden star.
658	00:35:20	00:35:22	Russell. Yeah.
659	00:35:22	00:35:25	I think we just went from one unsolved murder back to two.
660	00:35:25	00:35:28	I just read Doc Robbins' autopsy report on Tony Agrerro.
661	00:35:28	00:35:32	Now, the cause of death, that's not a surprise-- that dude was crushed.
662	00:35:32	00:35:34	It's the time of death that's a little off.
663	00:35:34	00:35:36	What do you mean, a little off?
664	00:35:36	00:35:41	According to Dave, it was around midnight, but according to Doc, it was much earlier.
665	00:35:41	00:35:43	Maybe as much as 18 hours earlier.
666	00:35:43	00:35:49	Whoa. Which means our other superhero, Scott Hunt, he doesn't work as the killer. He alibis out.
667	00:35:49	00:35:54	So he was telling the truth when he said he got to the yard and Agrerro was already dead.
668	00:35:54	00:35:57	How could David have been so far off with his estimate?
669	00:35:57	00:35:59	I don't think it was his fault.
670	00:35:59	00:36:00	It was that truck engine.
671	00:36:00	00:36:02	It really was running.
672	00:36:02	00:36:05	Killer must've left it that way after the murder.
673	00:36:05	00:36:07	But that engine would've kept that dead body warm though.
674	00:36:07	00:36:10	Throwing off David's calculations when he did the liver stick.
675	00:36:10	00:36:13	Okay, so new time of death.
676	00:36:13	00:36:22	That would put Agrerro's murder just a little bit after Brad Jeffries was killed in the alley, right? Probably first thing in the morning.
677	00:36:22	00:36:23	So what do you think?
678	00:36:23	00:36:26	Maybe we have two bodies but just one killer.
679	00:36:26	00:36:32	And zero idea who it is. I have good news on our murder weapon, particularly if you're a fan of Ethiopian cuisine.
680	00:36:32	00:36:40	There was butter on the club, fenugreek, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg.
681	00:36:40	00:36:45	A concoction more simply known as tesmi, common in Ethiopian cooking.
682	00:36:45	00:36:51	I did a quick check and found an Ethiopian restaurant just five blocks from the alley where the victim was found.
683	00:37:01	00:37:04	Well, there's our golden star.
684	00:37:04	00:37:08	So maybe old Roger was telling the truth about the club. Yeah.
685	00:37:09	00:37:12	It's empty.
686	00:37:12	00:37:20	Well, if the killer dumped the club in there, he figured he'd never see it again, 'cause it'd be hauled away with the trash, along with any piece of evidence that might've been along with it.
687	00:37:20	00:37:22	Oh, Nick.
688	00:37:23	00:37:25	Look at that.
689	00:37:30	00:37:32	Say cheese.
690	00:37:32	00:37:40	Clearly, this is you, Seth, ditching the murder weapon only minutes after Brad was killed.
691	00:37:40	00:37:43	We also have your phone records, yours and Agrerro's.
692	00:37:43	00:37:50	Looks like you and he spoke several times, before and right after Brad was beaten in the alley.
693	00:37:50	00:37:52	Seth, you need to talk to us, man.
694	00:37:52	00:37:57	Y-You know what the jury's gonna think when they see this? They're gonna think you're a monster.
695	00:37:57	00:38:00	You're not a monster.
696	00:38:03	00:38:07	I was just trying to teach him a lesson.
697	00:38:07	00:38:13	23 years old, living at home, dressing up in a costume.
698	00:38:13	00:38:16	I-I thought I could scare him, make him stop.
699	00:38:16	00:38:20	By having Tony Agrerro and his guys beat him up?
700	00:38:20	00:38:22	Y-You had warned him that...
701	00:38:22	00:38:24	it was dangerous out there, and this was gonna make your point.
702	00:38:24	00:38:27	It wasn't even that planned. Oh.
703	00:38:27	00:38:30	I-I met Agrerro by chance at a neighborhood bar.
704	00:38:30	00:38:34	I was bitching to the bartender about Brad and his friends, the-the whole superhero thing.
705	00:38:34	00:38:36	And Agrerro overheard me.
706	00:38:36	00:38:39	He came over, pissed off.
707	00:38:39	00:38:41	Because Brad dented his truck.
708	00:38:41	00:38:43	And-and now he expected me to pay the repairs.
709	00:38:43	00:38:46	Said I owed him 700 bucks.
710	00:38:46	00:38:50	I-I joked that I'd give him $1,000 if he and his guys would...
711	00:38:50	00:38:52	rough Brad up.
712	00:38:52	00:38:54	So it was a joke. I mean, at first.
713	00:38:54	00:38:57	After a few drinks, it started to sound like a good idea.
714	00:38:57	00:39:00	Let's talk about how we got here, okay?
715	00:39:00	00:39:06	H-How did this night happen? Tony called and said that he had done like we talked about, that they-they beat him up.
716	00:39:06	00:39:12	And I waited for Brad to come home, e-expecting him to call it quits.
717	00:39:12	00:39:16	But an hour passed, he didn't show up. So I went out looking for him.
718	00:39:16	00:39:19	I found him in that alley, knocked out.
719	00:39:19	00:39:21	He was just coming to.
720	00:39:21	00:39:22	Brad.
721	00:39:22	00:39:23	Seth.
722	00:39:23	00:39:25	What are you doing here?
723	00:39:25	00:39:28	Your mom's worried. I came looking for you.
724	00:39:28	00:39:32	This is exactly what I warned you about. Come on, Brad.
725	00:39:32	00:39:33	Let's go home.
726	00:39:33	00:39:36	But to be honest, I felt bad for him.
727	00:39:36	00:39:39	I mean, not my kid but-but I still cared.
728	00:39:41	00:39:47	But I messed up. I gu... I guess I said something about him being jumped by a gang.
729	00:39:47	00:39:49	How did you know that it was a gang that beat me up?
730	00:39:49	00:39:53	I didn't... I didn't say anything about a gang. Brad, come on.
731	00:39:53	00:39:55	You've been talking about a gang for weeks now.
732	00:39:55	00:39:57	You've never come looking for me.
733	00:39:57	00:40:00	And now you know exactly where to find me?
734	00:40:00	00:40:02	You son of a bitch.
735	00:40:02	00:40:03	You did this, didn't you?
736	00:40:03	00:40:06	You set me up. Okay, come on, Brad. Calm down...
737	00:40:06	00:40:08	No, don't touch me!
738	00:40:08	00:40:11	I will get home on my own.
739	00:40:11	00:40:16	And when I do, I'm telling her what you did, and your ass is gonna be out of our house for good.
740	00:40:16	00:40:18	No, no. You can't do that.
741	00:40:18	00:40:19	Screw you, Seth.
742	00:40:20	00:40:23	She's better off without you.
743	00:40:24	00:40:25	No!
744	00:40:25	00:40:29	It was just an impulse, a stupid mistake.
745	00:40:29	00:40:32	The club was in my hand... Seth, we get it.
746	00:40:32	00:40:34	You're not a killer.
747	00:40:34	00:40:35	No, I'm really not.
748	00:40:35	00:40:37	Yeah, but...
749	00:40:37	00:40:41	wh-why don't you tell me about Tony.
750	00:40:41	00:40:44	Tell me how that happened, Seth.
751	00:40:48	00:40:51	I went to pay Tony the next morning.
752	00:40:51	00:40:54	He must've heard about Brad being dead.
753	00:40:54	00:40:57	He thought that he could blackmail me.
754	00:40:57	00:41:00	So when he was on a call, I...
755	00:41:00	00:41:02	jammed the winch cable on his truck.
756	00:41:02	00:41:07	I knew he'd have to crawl in there to fix it.
757	00:41:07	00:41:10	It was just a matter of throwing a lever.
758	00:41:10	00:41:12	Okay.
759	00:41:12	00:41:16	So... the first killing was an impulse.
760	00:41:16	00:41:19	The second killing was about money.
761	00:41:21	00:41:25	Why don't you tell us again how you're not a killer, Seth.
762	00:41:34	00:41:36	There you are.
763	00:41:36	00:41:38	Good work on this one, by the way.
764	00:41:38	00:41:41	Thanks. It was, uh, good work all around.
765	00:41:41	00:41:45	Got a little, uh... a little something for you here.
766	00:41:45	00:41:48	What's this? Take a look.
767	00:41:48	00:41:51	Oh. (chuckles)
768	00:41:51	00:41:54	Comic books. Yep.
769	00:41:54	00:42:02	I went through my collection. I put together a little greatest hits bag for you. I also plain-wrapped it so I wouldn't blow your cover around here.
770	00:42:02	00:42:08	My cover? Yeah. You know, as the hard science and numbers person who has no time for fantasy.
771	00:42:08	00:42:14	I actually don't have time for fantasy. See, that's wrong. Everybody needs a little fantasy.
772	00:42:15	00:42:18	It's a lot of pressure, you know?
773	00:42:18	00:42:20	What if I don't like them?
774	00:42:20	00:42:23	Don't tell me.
775	00:42:25	00:42:28	Hey, Russell.
776	00:42:28	00:42:31	Thank you.
777	00:42:31	00:42:33	Yeah. You're welcome.
