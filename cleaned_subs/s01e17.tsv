0	00:00:24	00:00:25	Oh...
1	00:00:25	00:00:28	Honey here, take this.
2	00:00:36	00:00:38	Not again.
3	00:00:38	00:00:39	We are buying that alarm system.
4	00:00:39	00:00:41	No argument from me. I'm serious.
5	00:00:46	00:00:48	They got the cash.
6	00:00:48	00:00:49	Why did they have to make such a mess?
7	00:00:50	00:00:51	Oh, my God...
8	00:00:51	00:00:52	What? What's wrong?
9	00:00:52	00:00:54	Call 911.
10	00:01:36	00:01:37	Introductions?
11	00:01:37	00:01:41	Joseph Felton, 44 not an employee; no reason to be here.
12	00:01:41	00:01:43	Mind if he and I have a moment?
13	00:01:43	00:01:44	No.
14	00:02:19	00:02:20	Burn marks?
15	00:02:20	00:02:23	Unusual way to penetrate a safe.
16	00:02:23	00:02:24	Hmm...
17	00:02:24	00:02:25	How much was taken?
18	00:02:25	00:02:27	Three hundred and something, small bills.
19	00:02:27	00:02:30	Multiple contusions to the back of the skull.
20	00:02:30	00:02:32	Might've been taken by surprise.
21	00:02:32	00:02:34	Robbery interruptus?
22	00:02:34	00:02:37	Yeah, I think our robbery suspect is a homicide victim.
23	00:02:37	00:02:39	One way to beat the rap.
24	00:02:39	00:03:15	[Captioning sponsored by CBS and CBS PRODUCTIONS/ ALLIANCE ATLANTIS] This is an easy one.
25	00:03:15	00:03:16	Three hits to the head.
26	00:03:16	00:03:18	Trauma to the brain stem was fatal.
27	00:03:18	00:03:20	Death was instantaneous.
28	00:03:20	00:03:22	Can you tell us about the murder weapon?
29	00:03:23	00:03:27	Nothing definitive but I swabbed the points of impact.
30	00:03:27	00:03:29	Slide's under the microscope.
31	00:03:33	00:03:38	Yellow looks like transfer from the murder weapon but what's with the glitter?
32	00:03:38	00:03:39	Unidentified mineral.
33	00:03:39	00:03:42	I sent a sample to Trace for analysis.
34	00:03:42	00:03:44	Hey, Doc, you have a comb?
35	00:03:46	00:03:48	Your hair looks great, Cath.
36	00:03:48	00:03:49	Gee, thanks, Nick.
37	00:03:49	00:03:51	Guy's still dirty.
38	00:03:51	00:03:53	They don't get a bath till evidence is collected.
39	00:03:53	00:03:56	That's what I'm doing although I don't think this is dirt.
40	00:04:02	00:04:04	He's covered in spores.
41	00:04:09	00:04:11	I think these are from a fern.
42	00:04:11	00:04:14	Well, the back entrance was overgrown with them.
43	00:04:21	00:04:25	A fern plant deposits billions of spores in its lifetime.
44	00:04:25	00:04:27	Most are just dust in the wind.
45	00:04:27	00:04:29	In our case they're evidence.
46	00:04:29	00:04:35	As good as fingerprints or fibers in placing a suspect at a crime scene.
47	00:04:37	00:04:40	Hey, you forget about the coroner?
48	00:04:40	00:04:42	Melissa Marlowe.
49	00:04:42	00:04:44	Excuse me?
50	00:04:44	00:04:46	You lifted 38 prints from the pottery store.
51	00:04:46	00:04:48	I scanned them through AFIS.
52	00:04:48	00:04:49	One came back.
53	00:04:50	00:04:51	Melissa Marlowe.
54	00:04:51	00:04:53	Why do I know that name?
55	00:04:53	00:04:58	Kidnapping Arizona, 21 years ago...
56	00:04:58	00:05:00	the little girl.
57	00:05:00	00:05:03	Oh, that Melissa Marlowe.
58	00:05:03	00:05:05	Wasn't she presumed dead?
59	00:05:05	00:05:07	Well, not anymore.
60	00:05:07	00:05:12	On the left is Melissa Marlowe's print, age four-- preschool fingerprinting initiative.
61	00:05:12	00:05:14	On the right is a print that you lifted.
62	00:05:14	00:05:16	I don't see a match.
63	00:05:16	00:05:22	Neither did I but since fingerprints are set for life during the fourth month of fetal development I looked beyond the size differential.
64	00:05:22	00:05:26	Now, both prints are ulnar loops.
65	00:05:26	00:05:31	Bifurcation, recurve and ridge endings are identical.
66	00:05:32	00:05:34	I've aligned the prints along the delta.
67	00:05:38	00:05:41	You've got a perfect match.
68	00:05:41	00:05:46	Wait... is she a suspect in the homicide?
69	00:05:46	00:05:48	No, her print wasn't fresh.
70	00:05:48	00:05:49	There was dust on it.
71	00:05:49	00:05:51	Has to be a few weeks old.
72	00:05:51	00:05:53	I think we have two separate cases.
73	00:05:53	00:05:57	So I'm going to take the new lead in the old kidnapping case.
74	00:05:57	00:05:59	Nick and I will cover the homicide.
75	00:06:07	00:06:12	Nadine Winston falls asleep in that chair and incinerates.
76	00:06:12	00:06:13	We could make history.
77	00:06:13	00:06:15	Come on, now. Don't tell me you believe in that BS.
78	00:06:15	00:06:17	No, of course not.
79	00:06:18	00:06:21	I'm a scientist. I just...
80	00:06:21	00:06:23	She has been reduced to ashes.
81	00:06:27	00:06:30	Spontaneous human combustion is science fiction.
82	00:06:30	00:06:31	I know.
83	00:06:31	00:06:33	There's no such thing as a human torch.
84	00:06:35	00:06:38	What if it is real and we've uncovered it?
85	00:06:38	00:06:39	Sara, this is a crime scene.
86	00:06:39	00:06:41	Stay with me here, okay?
87	00:06:41	00:06:43	Don't lose it.
88	00:06:43	00:06:45	I'm not.
89	00:06:45	00:06:48	I'm just open to all theories.
90	00:06:49	00:06:50	What's that?
91	00:06:52	00:06:57	Looks like cotton fiber... possibly from a nightgown.
92	00:06:57	00:07:00	It's barely scorched.
93	00:07:00	00:07:02	Weird.
94	00:07:02	00:07:05	It's like the body burned, but...
95	00:07:06	00:07:09	the clothing was fire retardant.
96	00:07:13	00:07:15	Wow.
97	00:07:15	00:07:16	Check that out.
98	00:07:20	00:07:25	Fire practically burned a hole in the roof but it's isolated in one spot.
99	00:07:25	00:07:28	It's like the fire created a chimney for itself.
100	00:07:28	00:07:30	The victim she live alone?
101	00:07:30	00:07:32	Husband's already at the station.
102	00:07:32	00:07:37	Look, I am telling you, I have no idea what happened to my wife.
103	00:07:37	00:07:39	Were you having marital problems?
104	00:07:39	00:07:41	No.
105	00:07:41	00:07:45	We were like newlyweds.
106	00:07:45	00:07:49	If I understand you correctly you went to bed.
107	00:07:49	00:07:53	Nadine fell asleep in the easy chair.
108	00:07:53	00:07:58	Ten hours later you woke up, walked into the living room and she was a pile of ash.
109	00:07:58	00:08:00	A human torch.
110	00:08:00	00:08:01	Yeah, right.
111	00:08:01	00:08:04	You say you were like newlyweds?
112	00:08:04	00:08:05	Yeah.
113	00:08:06	00:08:08	But the two of you weren't sleeping in the same bed.
114	00:08:08	00:08:09	Good question.
115	00:08:12	00:08:13	She snored.
116	00:08:13	00:08:14	It was a problem.
117	00:08:17	00:08:19	A small one.
118	00:08:19	00:08:23	Mr. Winston...
119	00:08:23	00:08:25	do you know how to use a blowtorch?
120	00:08:25	00:08:27	Another good question.
121	00:08:27	00:08:29	Look, I came down to this station on my own.
122	00:08:29	00:08:32	If I can be helpful, let me know!
123	00:08:37	00:08:40	So you still think it's spontaneous combustion?
124	00:08:40	00:08:43	Theories give way to conclusions once all the evidence is in.
125	00:08:43	00:08:46	I am merely thinking about the next piece of evidence.
126	00:08:46	00:08:48	Yeah.
127	00:08:48	00:08:51	Hey, Nicky, you paged me?
128	00:08:51	00:08:53	Yeah. Yeah, Jim, hi.
129	00:08:53	00:08:56	I took these photos at the crime scene.
130	00:08:56	00:08:59	Safe was cracked with a plasma lance.
131	00:08:59	00:09:01	Okay, I'll bite.
132	00:09:01	00:09:03	It's a high-powered electric blaster.
133	00:09:03	00:09:06	It could cut through that hard plate with extreme precision.
134	00:09:06	00:09:08	It's not common, but effective.
135	00:09:08	00:09:10	Crime scene photo from a robbery case in '99.
136	00:09:10	00:09:23	Joseph Felton our dead guy, was arrested but granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against his partner, Darin Hanson who used a plasma lance to crack that safe.
137	00:09:23	00:09:28	Darin Hanson was released from prison last month.
138	00:09:28	00:09:33	Last known address, Vegas I see where you're going.
139	00:09:33	00:09:36	So Hanson gets out of jail, hooks up with our dead guy.
140	00:09:36	00:09:37	Yeah, they hook it up...
141	00:09:37	00:09:44	break through the rear entrance of the pottery store Hanson lances the safe...
142	00:09:46	00:09:50	Once the safe is cracked, Hanson steps back allowing Felton to collect the cash.
143	00:09:50	00:09:54	With Felton's attention diverted Hanson seizes the moment...
144	00:09:56	00:09:57	And kills him.
145	00:09:57	00:10:00	Revenge for testifying against him and putting him in prison.
146	00:10:01	00:10:02	That's not bad.
147	00:10:03	00:10:05	Any chance you found the murder weapon?
148	00:10:05	00:10:08	No, no... but I think we know who to ask.
149	00:10:08	00:10:11	I haven't seen Joseph Felton since the trial two years ago.
150	00:10:12	00:10:15	So it's a coincidence he was killed shortly after you were released from prison.
151	00:10:15	00:10:16	Yeah. Guy put me in jail.
152	00:10:16	00:10:18	I had no reason to see him again.
153	00:10:18	00:10:20	He put you in the Gray Bar?
154	00:10:20	00:10:21	Sounds like motive to me.
155	00:10:21	00:10:24	Darin you and Felton, you go back, huh?
156	00:10:25	00:10:26	Mm-hmm.
157	00:10:26	00:10:28	Knew the guy 15 years.
158	00:10:28	00:10:30	My folks lived across the street from him.
159	00:10:31	00:10:32	We'd barbecue with his wife and daughter.
160	00:10:32	00:10:35	Then it must've really pissed you off when he turned on you.
161	00:10:35	00:10:43	The transcript from your trial says that you used a plasma lance in that '99 burglary, and there it is again, Darin.
162	00:10:43	00:10:44	Joe was the lance guy.
163	00:10:44	00:10:47	He taught me how to break into safes.
164	00:10:47	00:10:48	That's why the MO's the same.
165	00:10:48	00:10:52	Where were you this morning early a.m.?
166	00:10:52	00:10:55	I was in Barstow all week.
167	00:10:55	00:10:57	Just got back this afternoon.
168	00:10:57	00:10:59	Okay...
169	00:10:59	00:11:01	here you go...
170	00:11:01	00:11:03	receipts from the trip.
171	00:11:03	00:11:04	Go ahead.
172	00:11:08	00:11:10	Looks authentic.
173	00:11:10	00:11:14	Cactus Pine Cafe, Barstow, noon today.
174	00:11:19	00:11:21	We can't hold him.
175	00:11:24	00:11:29	21 years ago, the chief of police sat in our living room and told us our daughter was dead.
176	00:11:29	00:11:30	After all this time, She's in Vegas?
177	00:11:30	00:11:32	That's a hundred miles from our home.
178	00:11:32	00:11:34	Well, we still don't know where she is.
179	00:11:34	00:11:41	Her prints in the pottery store tell us that she was here possibly a few weeks ago, but Vegas is a tourist town.
180	00:11:41	00:11:43	But you know she's alive.
181	00:11:43	00:11:45	I'm still not sure we can find her.
182	00:11:45	00:11:47	She's our only child.
183	00:11:47	00:11:49	We never gave up hope.
184	00:11:49	00:11:50	We're not giving up now.
185	00:11:50	00:11:51	Excuse me.
186	00:11:51	00:11:53	Teri...
187	00:11:53	00:11:54	come in.
188	00:11:54	00:11:55	Hi.
189	00:11:56	00:11:57	Teri Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe.
190	00:11:57	00:11:58	Hello.
191	00:11:58	00:11:59	Hi.
192	00:11:59	00:12:01	Teri is a forensic artist.
193	00:12:01	00:12:02	I called her to help us.
194	00:12:02	00:12:04	Did you bring the photographs of Melissa?
195	00:12:04	00:12:07	Yes, but I don't see how they can help.
196	00:12:07	00:12:09	In some of those, she's just an infant.
197	00:12:09	00:12:10	It doesn't matter.
198	00:12:10	00:12:11	Do you remember her eyes?
199	00:12:12	00:12:14	I could never forget.
200	00:12:14	00:12:15	As we age, our eyes don't change.
201	00:12:15	00:12:16	That's where we'll start.
202	00:12:16	00:12:24	Using computer software Teri can age Melissa's picture so that we can determine what she looks like today at age 25.
203	00:12:24	00:12:27	Then we send it off to every law enforcement agency in the state.
204	00:12:27	00:12:28	It's been so long.
205	00:12:28	00:12:30	Tell us the truth.
206	00:12:30	00:12:31	What are our chances?
207	00:12:31	00:12:36	Well, 21 years ago, they told you that your daughter was dead.
208	00:12:36	00:12:39	Now we're moving in the right direction.
209	00:12:50	00:12:53	Where did you find him?
210	00:12:53	00:12:58	At a pottery store on Stansberry Street.
211	00:12:59	00:13:01	Tammy, we've already ID'd your father.
212	00:13:01	00:13:03	If you don't want to see him, I'd understand.
213	00:13:03	00:13:06	No, I want to say good-bye.
214	00:13:06	00:13:10	Well, don't be surprised by some swelling and discoloration.
215	00:13:31	00:13:33	You have any other family?
216	00:13:33	00:13:34	No.
217	00:13:38	00:13:42	I can put you in touch with a counselor if you need to talk.
218	00:13:42	00:13:44	No, thank you.
219	00:13:50	00:13:51	If there's anything you need...
220	00:14:11	00:14:13	Tammy...
221	00:14:13	00:14:16	were you at the pottery store with your father?
222	00:14:18	00:14:19	What are you talking about?
223	00:14:22	00:14:24	There's some plant spores on your sweater.
224	00:14:26	00:14:31	We found them on your father, too and matched them to some ferns behind the pottery store.
225	00:14:31	00:14:33	I don't understand.
226	00:14:34	00:14:37	What are you doing?
227	00:14:37	00:14:38	I'm taking these spores into evidence.
228	00:14:38	00:14:43	They place you at the crime scene.
229	00:14:45	00:14:47	Is there anything you want to tell me?
230	00:14:51	00:14:54	Okay, I was there.
231	00:14:55	00:14:56	Dad!
232	00:14:57	00:14:58	Dad, don't do this.
233	00:14:58	00:14:59	I'll get a job.
234	00:14:59	00:15:01	We don't need the money.
235	00:15:01	00:15:03	Tammy, go home.
236	00:15:07	00:15:09	And I don't know what happened after that.
237	00:15:09	00:15:12	Why didn't you just tell me that?
238	00:15:12	00:15:19	I wanted to preserve the good memories not remember my dad as a thief.
239	00:15:19	00:15:22	I didn't kill him; I loved him.
240	00:15:24	00:15:28	I need a release from your office...
241	00:15:28	00:15:30	so I can bury my father.
242	00:15:36	00:15:38	Tell me everything you can about this foot.
243	00:15:39	00:15:40	Where's the rest of the body?
244	00:15:40	00:15:41	Incinerated.
245	00:15:41	00:15:43	Lab results from the ashes came back.
246	00:15:43	00:15:44	Negative for accelerant.
247	00:15:44	00:15:46	Nothing flammable but sebaceous glutamate.
248	00:15:46	00:15:48	Human fat.
249	00:15:48	00:15:49	Well...
250	00:15:49	00:15:53	I can tell you that the malleolus-- the ankle bone-- is completely hollowed out.
251	00:15:53	00:15:56	Bone marrow was reduced to ash.
252	00:15:56	00:15:59	Which means that the foot was burned off the body, not severed.
253	00:16:00	00:16:03	That's consistent with your theory of spontaneous combustion.
254	00:16:03	00:16:04	How do you know about Sara's theory?
255	00:16:04	00:16:06	Word gets around.
256	00:16:06	00:16:08	You're siding with Sara 'cause you got a crush on her.
257	00:16:08	00:16:10	No, that's why I wore a clean coat.
258	00:16:10	00:16:12	I'm just reporting my observations.
259	00:16:12	00:16:15	If the foot had been severed, the marrow would still be intact.
260	00:16:15	00:16:19	So your official observation is spontaneous combustion?
261	00:16:19	00:16:20	Not yet.
262	00:16:20	00:16:23	I want to send a scraping down to toxicology.
263	00:16:24	00:16:26	Excuse me.
264	00:16:26	00:16:31	I want to check for any flammable compounds in the blood but don't expect much.
265	00:16:31	00:16:36	The quality of the sample may have been compromised by the heat.
266	00:16:37	00:16:39	I'm going to go talk to Grissom see what he thinks.
267	00:16:39	00:16:41	No, no, we're a team.
268	00:16:41	00:16:44	The only place we're going is back down to that crime scene.
269	00:16:44	00:16:46	Okay, software's loaded.
270	00:16:47	00:16:49	It's preprogrammed with developmental averages?
271	00:16:49	00:16:50	Exactly.
272	00:16:51	00:16:54	Aging is about predictable craniofacial growth.
273	00:16:54	00:16:55	Faces grow down and out.
274	00:16:55	00:16:58	So the first step is to stretch the bottom half of the face.
275	00:17:01	00:17:02	You try.
276	00:17:02	00:17:04	Go ahead.
277	00:17:10	00:17:11	Well!
278	00:17:13	00:17:14	Maybe you should drive.
279	00:17:14	00:17:15	Good idea.
280	00:17:16	00:17:18	Here we go.
281	00:17:18	00:17:26	So at age four, the bridge of the nose is taking shape and the interorbital distance is established and baby teeth are visible.
282	00:17:26	00:17:28	I have a question.
283	00:17:28	00:17:29	Okay.
284	00:17:29	00:17:34	Since I screwed up our last date will we ever have dinner again?
285	00:17:34	00:17:35	Oh, we'll have dinner...
286	00:17:35	00:17:38	just not together.
287	00:17:38	00:17:42	So the ears are low and large in proportion to the head.
288	00:17:42	00:17:44	You know, I did apologize.
289	00:17:44	00:17:47	And you're forgiven.
290	00:17:47	00:17:58	So over the next ten years, the face elongates the skin thickens, the hair pattern is set and the small deciduous teeth are replaced by the secondary dentition.
291	00:17:58	00:18:04	Once the face is aged I look to the mother to fill in the blanks.
292	00:18:06	00:18:07	Is that Mrs. Marlowe?
293	00:18:07	00:18:08	Uh-huh.
294	00:18:08	00:18:13	Most daughters at age 25 age quite similar to their mothers.
295	00:18:17	00:18:22	A network of grids allows me to fine-tune the tiniest facial characteristics one section at a time.
296	00:18:22	00:18:28	I'm just softening a few edges, growing the hair...
297	00:18:29	00:18:32	and we're done.
298	00:18:32	00:18:34	Well...
299	00:18:34	00:18:35	hello, Melissa.
300	00:18:35	00:18:37	Am I interrupting?
301	00:18:37	00:18:38	Not at all.
302	00:18:38	00:18:39	You're just in time.
303	00:18:40	00:18:43	Catherine, say hello to Melissa Marlowe.
304	00:18:46	00:18:48	Oh, my God.
305	00:18:48	00:18:50	What?
306	00:18:50	00:18:55	That's Tammy Felton and we've already met.
307	00:18:58	00:19:01	Tammy Felton's our murder suspect?
308	00:19:01	00:19:08	She was kidnapped 21 year ago and may have killed the man who raised her-- possibly the same man who kidnapped her.
309	00:19:08	00:19:12	Whoa, wait. I thought her prints from the crime scene-- they weren't fresh.
310	00:19:12	00:19:17	Yeah, well, she could've cased the place weeks ago and then remembered to wear gloves on the big night.
311	00:19:17	00:19:19	So what's the word on the murder weapon?
312	00:19:19	00:19:21	Well, the swab from the head wound's at Trace.
313	00:19:21	00:19:22	And?
314	00:19:22	00:19:23	I'm on it.
315	00:19:23	00:19:27	You and I have an appointment with our shrink.
316	00:19:27	00:19:29	Here-- you twirl, I'll talk.
317	00:19:29	00:19:31	My son has Little League in an hour.
318	00:19:31	00:19:34	He's scared of the ball.
319	00:19:34	00:19:36	You think this new bat's going to do the trick?
320	00:19:37	00:19:39	Why don't you just talk with him?
321	00:19:43	00:19:45	Dr. Kane, this girl was kidnapped at age four.
322	00:19:46	00:19:48	Would she have any recollection of her prior life?
323	00:19:48	00:20:01	The theory of infantile amnesia suggests that we have no cognitive memory before the age of three but since Tammy-- or Melissa-- was taken from her biological parents at age four she may remember something of her former life.
324	00:20:01	00:20:05	But these memories would be... tenuous?
325	00:20:05	00:20:11	A sound or a smell might awaken some latent image or feeling but she'd have difficulty contextualizing these sensations.
326	00:20:11	00:20:14	That's got to be frustrating.
327	00:20:14	00:20:21	And it's precisely that frustration which dominates this woman's present state of mind.
328	00:20:21	00:20:27	Kidnapped children at that age tend to exhibit some degree of sociopathy as adults.
329	00:20:27	00:20:28	Such as?
330	00:20:28	00:20:32	Inability to feel guilt, compassion or love, right?
331	00:20:32	00:20:36	Correct, but the most defining characteristic is their instinct for survival.
332	00:20:36	00:20:39	There's nothing that they won't do.
333	00:20:39	00:20:41	Tammy Felton needs help.
334	00:20:41	00:20:45	She may be a suspect, but she's also a victim.
335	00:20:45	00:20:46	Cath, meet with her again.
336	00:20:46	00:20:48	Ask open questions.
337	00:20:50	00:20:52	Thanks for your insights, Philip.
338	00:20:52	00:20:54	I'll let you know how this unfolds.
339	00:20:54	00:20:57	Gil... be careful.
340	00:20:57	00:21:04	Sociopaths are dangerous because they don't function by the same... moral code as the rest of us.
341	00:21:04	00:21:08	Welcome to my world.
342	00:21:08	00:21:09	I checked with Homicide again.
343	00:21:09	00:21:11	They found no evidence of foul play.
344	00:21:11	00:21:13	What about the husband-- is he still a suspect?
345	00:21:13	00:21:14	No motive.
346	00:21:14	00:21:16	O'Riley spoke with friends and relatives.
347	00:21:16	00:21:17	They were a loving couple.
348	00:21:17	00:21:21	What about, uh... life insurance policies?
349	00:21:21	00:21:23	No, and you're reaching.
350	00:21:23	00:21:24	I'm not the one who's reaching here.
351	00:21:24	00:21:26	We're scientists, right?
352	00:21:26	00:21:29	We want answers, the satisfaction of certainty.
353	00:21:29	00:21:32	I'm not ignoring scientific method.
354	00:21:32	00:21:34	I'm just keeping an open mind.
355	00:21:34	00:21:39	If we eliminate all the alternatives we're left with spontaneous combustion.
356	00:21:39	00:21:41	That's exciting!
357	00:21:41	00:21:45	That would be cool, but you've been jumping to that conclusion from minute one.
358	00:21:45	00:21:46	She's a pile of ash.
359	00:21:46	00:21:48	Well, I brought the ion detector.
360	00:21:48	00:21:52	This will pick up even the smallest traces of hydrocarbon fumes.
361	00:21:52	00:21:54	I don't care what the lab says.
362	00:21:54	00:22:00	This puppy will reveal exactly what accelerant was used to start the fire.
363	00:22:12	00:22:13	Well?
364	00:22:16	00:22:17	Nothing.
365	00:22:19	00:22:21	You know I love you.
366	00:22:21	00:22:25	Yes... no, I love you more.
367	00:22:25	00:22:26	No, I love you more.
368	00:22:31	00:22:33	Bye, baby.
369	00:22:33	00:22:36	Do you have the results on the swab yet?
370	00:22:36	00:22:37	Uh...
371	00:22:38	00:22:40	Uh... from the dead guy at the pottery store?
372	00:22:40	00:22:41	The coroner sent over a sample.
373	00:22:41	00:22:45	You were supposed to analyze the mineral content.
374	00:22:45	00:22:46	Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
375	00:22:46	00:22:49	Grissom has just been running me around like a lapdog.
376	00:22:49	00:22:51	I haven't had a chance.
377	00:22:51	00:22:53	Grissom's on a missing persons-- he hasn't sent you anything.
378	00:22:53	00:22:56	Did I say Grissom?
379	00:22:56	00:22:57	No, I meant Catherine.
380	00:22:57	00:22:59	Oh, yeah. Catherine's working with me.
381	00:22:59	00:23:01	Oh.
382	00:23:01	00:23:03	Well, what do you say we check out that swab then, huh?
383	00:23:03	00:23:05	Great.
384	00:23:08	00:23:10	Don't you ever goof off, huh?
385	00:23:11	00:23:13	Do you ever get a little lost in life?
386	00:23:13	00:23:15	No.
387	00:23:15	00:23:17	Well, you should.
388	00:23:23	00:23:26	Do you see the sparkling bits?
389	00:23:26	00:23:28	Fluorescent minerals.
390	00:23:28	00:23:29	Interesting.
391	00:23:29	00:23:32	Here, do me a favor, will you?
392	00:23:32	00:23:34	Put your nose down the scope.
393	00:23:34	00:23:38	When you see the sparkling bits glow give a shout.
394	00:23:50	00:23:52	Okay, ready?
395	00:23:52	00:23:54	Yeah, ready.
396	00:23:59	00:24:00	Lead.
397	00:24:00	00:24:03	Zinc.
398	00:24:06	00:24:08	Lithium.
399	00:24:08	00:24:09	Anything?
400	00:24:09	00:24:10	Nothing yet.
401	00:24:11	00:24:14	Manganese.
402	00:24:17	00:24:19	Petroleum.
403	00:24:22	00:24:23	Whoa, whoa, whoa...
404	00:24:23	00:24:24	Stop.
405	00:24:26	00:24:28	It's uranium.
406	00:24:28	00:24:29	Are you serious?
407	00:24:29	00:24:32	Simple quantum mechanics.
408	00:24:32	00:24:40	When the molecule is bombarded with energy at a specific level the electrons excite, causing the mineral to glow and at this wavelength, it's definitely uranium.
409	00:24:40	00:24:41	Which is radioactive.
410	00:24:42	00:24:44	Do we need to evacuate the building or anything?
411	00:24:44	00:24:47	The amount is trace.
412	00:24:47	00:24:48	We should be fine.
413	00:24:48	00:24:49	Are you sure?
414	00:24:49	00:24:50	No.
415	00:24:52	00:24:58	But I can tell you one thing for sure-- there is definitely uranium on your murder weapon.
416	00:25:00	00:25:06	I hear that, uh Greg found uranium on the swab from Felton's skull.
417	00:25:06	00:25:09	Yeah. He says I'm okay, but you know Greg.
418	00:25:09	00:25:12	Tell me, am I radiating a green glow?
419	00:25:13	00:25:15	You'll be fine, Silkwood.
420	00:25:15	00:25:17	What's uranium doing on a murder weapon, anyway?
421	00:25:17	00:25:26	Well, before Peter Parker was bit by that radioactive spider and became Spider-Man back in the '50s oxidized uranium flecks were used as color enhancers.
422	00:25:26	00:25:27	Color enhancers?
423	00:25:27	00:25:29	Like paint?
424	00:25:29	00:25:31	Paints, dyes, glazes...
425	00:25:31	00:25:35	Since our guy was killed in a pottery store...
426	00:25:35	00:25:37	Say no more.
427	00:26:17	00:26:20	You got to be kidding me.
428	00:26:21	00:26:22	You found Melissa?
429	00:26:22	00:26:23	Yes.
430	00:26:23	00:26:25	When can we see her?
431	00:26:25	00:26:28	It's not quite that simple.
432	00:26:28	00:26:29	What do you mean?
433	00:26:29	00:26:31	Well, I don't want to be evasive.
434	00:26:31	00:26:33	It's just that, uh...
435	00:26:33	00:26:36	we suspect she might've committed a crime.
436	00:26:36	00:26:38	What kind of crime?
437	00:26:38	00:26:41	A homicide.
438	00:26:41	00:26:42	This can't be happening.
439	00:26:42	00:26:45	Mr. Grissom, we want to see our daughter-- now.
440	00:26:48	00:26:50	Tell me about your mother.
441	00:26:50	00:26:53	What's she got to do with this?
442	00:26:53	00:27:03	Tammy, if you've got nothing to hide and you want me to find out who killed your father why don't you just answer my questions?
443	00:27:03	00:27:05	Mara, my mother...
444	00:27:05	00:27:07	died a few years ago.
445	00:27:07	00:27:14	I can let you see her, but I can't allow you to talk to her not right now and not under these circumstances.
446	00:27:21	00:27:24	Do you have any siblings?
447	00:27:24	00:27:27	Only child.
448	00:27:27	00:27:29	How was your childhood?
449	00:27:29	00:27:31	Were you a happy child?
450	00:27:31	00:27:33	Did you have any friends?
451	00:27:33	00:27:36	Look, I don't see how these questions are going to help you.
452	00:27:36	00:27:38	May I go?
453	00:27:38	00:27:41	Sure.
454	00:27:51	00:27:53	Melissa!
455	00:27:53	00:27:55	Melissa...
456	00:27:55	00:27:56	Excuse me?
457	00:27:56	00:27:57	It's mom...
458	00:27:57	00:27:59	Baby...
459	00:27:59	00:28:01	Lady...
460	00:28:02	00:28:04	I'm not your daughter.
461	00:28:09	00:28:12	Who is she?
462	00:28:12	00:28:14	Her name? Who is she now?
463	00:28:15	00:28:17	Tammy-- Tammy Felton.
464	00:28:17	00:28:19	Oh, my God.
465	00:28:19	00:28:20	What?
466	00:28:20	00:28:22	Mara Felton was our baby-sitter.
467	00:28:22	00:28:26	The police questioned Mara when Melissa disappeared.
468	00:28:26	00:28:29	Tammy referred to her mother as Mara, now deceased.
469	00:28:29	00:28:31	I am her mother.
470	00:28:31	00:28:33	Of course. I didn't mean...
471	00:28:33	00:28:35	We need a lawyer.
472	00:28:35	00:28:36	Why would you need a lawyer?
473	00:28:37	00:28:39	Not for us; for our daughter.
474	00:28:46	00:28:47	What were you thinking?
475	00:28:47	00:28:49	I don't know.
476	00:28:49	00:28:53	I wanted to observe them, I guess.
477	00:28:53	00:28:56	That woman hasn't seen her daughter in 21 years.
478	00:28:56	00:28:59	You actually thought a glass wall would keep them apart?
479	00:28:59	00:29:01	I never thought about that.
480	00:29:01	00:29:02	I know.
481	00:29:02	00:29:05	You're not good with people.
482	00:29:05	00:29:06	Yeah.
483	00:29:08	00:29:11	Interesting voice mail you left me.
484	00:29:11	00:29:13	What's that?
485	00:29:13	00:29:16	Meet me behind CSI and bring a cotton nightgown.
486	00:29:16	00:29:19	I'd wear it for you but, uh, I prefer pajamas.
487	00:29:19	00:29:23	Really? It was actually for my girlfriend here-- Miss Piggy.
488	00:29:23	00:29:25	We're experimenting on a pig again?
489	00:29:25	00:29:26	Yeah.
490	00:29:26	00:29:32	You know, I-I-I haven't eaten meat since Grissom used one to estimate postmortem insect growth.
491	00:29:32	00:29:35	Well, I tried for human volunteers, but no takers.
492	00:29:35	00:29:36	What are you going to do, exactly?
493	00:29:36	00:29:37	What are we going to do?
494	00:29:37	00:29:42	We're disproving the existence of spontaneous human combustion.
495	00:29:42	00:29:43	You do not give up.
496	00:29:43	00:29:46	Well, we're recreating the death of Nadine Winston, right?
497	00:29:46	00:29:52	She was wearing a cotton nightgown-- thank you-- and she had a half a pack of smokes on her end table which means she was probably smoking.
498	00:29:52	00:29:57	If she burned herself with a cigarette she would've woken up, not burned up.
499	00:29:57	00:29:59	toxicology sample came back.
500	00:29:59	00:30:02	Nadine had a high concentration of Seconal in her blood.
501	00:30:02	00:30:04	Sleeping pills.
502	00:30:04	00:30:06	Enough to knock out a horse.
503	00:30:07	00:30:10	All right.
504	00:30:15	00:30:17	Care for a light?
505	00:30:28	00:30:30	Now what?
506	00:30:30	00:30:33	We wait.
507	00:30:35	00:30:38	Hi, Tammy.
508	00:30:38	00:30:40	We just, uh, want to look around.
509	00:30:40	00:30:41	We have a warrant.
510	00:30:41	00:30:43	A warrant for what?
511	00:30:43	00:30:46	Any evidence linking you to the murder of your father.
512	00:30:46	00:30:48	Tammy, could you step outside?
513	00:30:48	00:30:49	This officer will keep you company.
514	00:31:08	00:31:09	What?
515	00:31:09	00:31:11	I should get a finder's fee.
516	00:31:16	00:31:18	Here. One for each of you.
517	00:31:21	00:31:23	Yellow paint.
518	00:31:23	00:31:25	Shall we test for uranium?
519	00:31:26	00:31:29	I need a darkroom.
520	00:31:40	00:31:45	Now, if uranium is present the photons should react with the film.
521	00:32:11	00:32:13	Well, that's affirmative for uranium.
522	00:32:13	00:32:15	Nicely done, Nick.
523	00:32:15	00:32:17	Thanks.
524	00:32:29	00:32:30	Miss, have you ever worn these gloves?
525	00:32:30	00:32:33	No. They belonged to my mother.
526	00:32:35	00:32:37	Really? Well, we'll see.
527	00:32:41	00:32:45	Tammy, I need your right index finger.
528	00:33:31	00:33:34	It's a perfect match.
529	00:33:35	00:33:38	Joe lanced the safe.
530	00:33:38	00:33:46	Once the safe was cracked you seized the moment and bashed his head in-- three blows.
531	00:33:49	00:33:51	Nick, call Brass.
532	00:33:51	00:33:54	Tell him it's time to make an arrest.
533	00:33:54	00:33:56	Done.
534	00:33:56	00:33:58	You're making a mistake.
535	00:33:58	00:34:00	I didn't kill my father.
536	00:34:01	00:34:04	We weren't alone.
537	00:34:04	00:34:09	I'm sorry, but there's no evidence to indicate that there was a third person present at the crime scene.
538	00:34:09	00:34:11	Who else was there?
539	00:34:11	00:34:15	I tried to stop her, I swear.
540	00:34:15	00:34:17	Tammy...
541	00:34:19	00:34:20	Who was with you?
542	00:34:22	00:34:24	Melissa Marlowe.
543	00:34:27	00:34:31	But that bitch wouldn't listen.
544	00:34:31	00:34:33	So we're looking at a split personality?
545	00:34:33	00:34:34	Quite possible.
546	00:34:34	00:34:37	Two personalities in one.
547	00:34:37	00:34:40	Is there any scientific evidence that supports this disorder?
548	00:34:40	00:34:46	Brain scans have documented changes in the hippocampus of individuals shifting from one personality to another.
549	00:34:46	00:34:49	But would these two personalities be aware of each other?
550	00:34:49	00:34:53	Well, usually the dominant personality is aware of everything.
551	00:34:54	00:34:57	The subjugated personality is only aware of itself.
552	00:34:57	00:34:58	Tammy's the dominant personality.
553	00:34:58	00:35:03	But Melissa killed Joseph Felton-- Tammy's father.
554	00:35:03	00:35:07	Who was also Melissa's kidnapper.
555	00:35:07	00:35:11	But revenge for a kidnapping 21 years after the fact?
556	00:35:11	00:35:12	Well, it is possible.
557	00:35:12	00:35:16	It may have taken that long for the subjugated personality to break free.
558	00:35:17	00:35:22	Maybe, uh, Miss Mirror Has Two Faces is playing us for fools.
559	00:35:22	00:35:28	We corner her with the evidence, she goes nuts sets the groundwork for an insanity plea.
560	00:35:28	00:35:30	Forensic Psychology is a science.
561	00:35:30	00:35:32	We have to stay open to all the possibilities.
562	00:35:34	00:35:36	Captain? Yeah?
563	00:35:36	00:35:38	The girl's parents are here with her attorney.
564	00:35:38	00:35:40	Well, this ought to be interesting.
565	00:35:48	00:35:50	Melissa...
566	00:35:50	00:35:55	Lady, I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are.
567	00:35:55	00:36:01	I'm not Melissa; I'm Tammy-- Tammy Felton.
568	00:36:01	00:36:04	Tammy, my name is Randy Painter. I'm a defense attorney.
569	00:36:04	00:36:06	The Marlowes have hired me to defend you.
570	00:36:06	00:36:08	I didn't kill my father.
571	00:36:09	00:36:15	Melissa, I don't know what you've been told but you're our daughter.
572	00:36:15	00:36:17	You were taken from us.
573	00:36:17	00:36:19	We've spent the last 21 years looking for you.
574	00:36:19	00:36:25	My father was Joseph, my mother was Mara and they're both dead.
575	00:36:25	00:36:26	Bail's been set at half a million dollars.
576	00:36:37	00:36:40	Are you looking at my necklace?
577	00:36:43	00:36:48	Your father bought this for me when you were born and you used to play with it.
578	00:36:55	00:36:58	And we're not going to let you go to jai.
579	00:36:59	00:37:00	Right, Hank?
580	00:37:00	00:37:03	Raising even ten percent won't be easy.
581	00:37:04	00:37:07	Hank, she's not spending another night away from us.
582	00:37:07	00:37:08	Whatever it takes.
583	00:37:08	00:37:09	When are we due in court?
584	00:37:09	00:37:11	00 a.m.
585	00:37:11	00:37:13	Then I'd better hurry with bail.
586	00:37:30	00:37:32	I just got back to the lab, saw the smoke. What's up?
587	00:37:32	00:37:34	We're just working the case.
588	00:37:34	00:37:37	Yeah, we're disproving spontaneous human combustion.
589	00:37:37	00:37:40	We dressed a pig up in a cotton dress and torched it with a cigarette.
590	00:37:40	00:37:42	And what happened?
591	00:37:42	00:37:44	The pig's been reduced to ash.
592	00:37:44	00:37:47	The fat acted like candle wax; burned hot, slow and intense.
593	00:37:47	00:37:50	Nothing spontaneous about it.
594	00:37:50	00:37:55	You both knew there would be a scientific explanation for the human torch, though, right?
595	00:37:55	00:37:56	Of course.
596	00:37:59	00:38:00	Did you find the wick?
597	00:38:00	00:38:01	The wick?
598	00:38:01	00:38:03	The what?
599	00:38:03	00:38:08	A piece of fabric that's scorched but not completely burned...
600	00:38:08	00:38:10	like possibly from the nightgown.
601	00:38:12	00:38:14	We found the same thing at the crime scene.
602	00:38:14	00:38:15	It's called the wick effect.
603	00:38:15	00:38:17	It's like an inside-out candle.
604	00:38:17	00:38:23	The fabric acts like a wick, and the body burns inward explaining the high temperatures which destroy the bone.
605	00:38:23	00:38:27	The fabric ends up scorched, but not completely burned.
606	00:38:27	00:38:28	You knew about the ashes?
607	00:38:28	00:38:30	Why didn't you say something when you gave us the case?
608	00:38:30	00:38:34	Well, in science we learn through experimentation, right?
609	00:38:34	00:38:36	Sometimes we need to see it to believe it.
610	00:38:36	00:38:39	You guys did a nice job.
611	00:38:39	00:38:42	Now you have to clean it up.
612	00:38:45	00:38:48	Well, I would've looked like an idiot.
613	00:38:50	00:38:51	Thanks for covering.
614	00:38:51	00:38:54	Well, you can show your appreciation by, uh, cleaning up.
615	00:38:55	00:38:57	Done.
616	00:38:58	00:38:59	Thank you.
617	00:39:04	00:39:06	I got a call that Melissa wanted to see me.
618	00:39:06	00:39:09	Thanks for coming.
619	00:39:09	00:39:12	Am I speaking to Melissa... or Tammy?
620	00:39:12	00:39:13	Melissa.
621	00:39:13	00:39:15	I know who I am now...
622	00:39:15	00:39:20	after spending time with my real parents.
623	00:39:20	00:39:21	I'm not an attorney.
624	00:39:21	00:39:23	There are no privileges here.
625	00:39:23	00:39:24	Whatever you say...
626	00:39:24	00:39:26	What are my chances... in court?
627	00:39:26	00:39:30	The evidence is damaging.
628	00:39:30	00:39:33	If I plead insanity...?
629	00:39:33	00:39:36	You have a lawyer. Why are you asking me?
630	00:39:36	00:39:38	You wanted to help me.
631	00:39:38	00:39:42	When I ID'd Joe, you were kind.
632	00:39:44	00:39:48	I need you to testify that I was not sane at the time that I killed Joe.
633	00:39:49	00:39:53	My lawyer says that would go a really long way with a jury.
634	00:39:54	00:39:56	I'm not an expert.
635	00:39:56	00:39:57	But it doesn't matter.
636	00:39:57	00:39:58	You spent time with me.
637	00:39:58	00:40:00	You could answer questions the right way.
638	00:40:04	00:40:14	I can't explain what happened in that room today but it's like... the only memories I have are of being a little kid.
639	00:40:15	00:40:21	The last 21 years are a blank-- like they never happened.
640	00:40:26	00:40:29	Then you shouldn't have any memories of me...
641	00:40:29	00:40:31	Tammy.
642	00:40:34	00:40:37	There is no Melissa, is there?
643	00:40:37	00:40:42	Get the hell out of here.
644	00:40:44	00:40:45	I'm gone.
645	00:40:47	00:40:49	Don't go!
646	00:40:53	00:40:56	Don't leave me here with her.
647	00:40:58	00:41:01	Just practicing for court.
648	00:41:01	00:41:02	Not bad, huh?
649	00:41:04	00:41:05	Guard.
650	00:41:26	00:41:29	Hey, come on, we're going to be late for the prelim.
651	00:41:29	00:41:32	Tammy Felton's prelim's been postponed indefinitely.
652	00:41:32	00:41:34	What? Why?
653	00:41:34	00:41:36	She left town. Skipped bail.
654	00:41:36	00:41:40	How much did the parents lose?
655	00:41:40	00:41:42	Their house and their life savings.
656	00:41:44	00:41:47	It's over.
657	00:41:47	00:41:48	Case closed.
658	00:41:48	00:41:51	We move on.
659	00:41:51	00:41:53	Right.
660	00:41:57	00:41:58	Brass, it's Catherine.
661	00:41:59	00:42:02	I need a credit card purchase report on the Marlowes.
662	00:42:02	00:42:03	The last 24 hours.
663	00:42:03	00:42:04	Based on what?
664	00:42:04	00:42:09	Based on the fact that the Marlowes are blind when it comes to their daughter and would do anything for her.
665	00:42:09	00:42:11	We have no idea where she is.
666	00:42:11	00:42:16	Look, you're here, she's not and we know that you helped her flee the jurisdiction.
667	00:42:16	00:42:17	What?
668	00:42:17	00:42:20	22 bus tickets bought with your credit card to 22 different states?
669	00:42:21	00:42:23	You made sure that we couldn't track her.
670	00:42:24	00:42:26	Now, that's aiding and abetting the flight of a suspected felon.
671	00:42:26	00:42:33	Wherever you think she is-- wherever you're planning on meeting her-- she's not there.
672	00:42:33	00:42:34	She played you.
673	00:42:34	00:42:40	Now, if you'll just tell us where she is, we won't file charges, right?
674	00:42:40	00:42:42	Well, if she's apprehended, yes.
675	00:42:43	00:42:45	Otherwise it's a felony.
676	00:42:45	00:42:47	You're going to jail.
677	00:42:47	00:42:51	Arrest us.
678	00:42:51	00:42:55	Think about what you're doing.
679	00:42:55	00:42:57	We know exactly what we're doing.
680	00:42:57	00:42:58	Melissa's free.
681	00:42:58	00:43:00	That's all that matters.
682	00:43:04	00:43:06	Frankie?
683	00:43:08	00:43:09	You have the right to remain silent.
684	00:43:10	00:43:13	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
685	00:44:01	00:44:03	Am I late?
686	00:44:03	00:44:05	Oh, you're worth waiting for.
687	00:44:07	00:44:09	You owe me one, Darin.
688	00:44:09	00:44:10	Owe you?
689	00:44:10	00:44:12	I'm the one that told you the truth about your father.
690	00:44:13	00:44:15	And you knew exactly what I'd do about it.
691	00:44:24	00:44:26	Where to?
692	00:44:26	00:44:28	Does it matter?
