1,00:02:29,00:02:31,(music continues)
2,00:02:31,00:02:33,What the hell kind of music is that?
3,00:02:34,00:02:36,Inspiration.
4,00:02:36,00:02:39,Sedative.
5,00:02:39,00:02:40,Okay. (changes radio station)
6,00:02:41,00:02:42,(country music playing)
7,00:02:43,00:02:44,How's this?
8,00:02:45,00:02:49,How about something that doesn't twang?
9,00:02:49,00:02:51,(changes radio station)
10,00:02:53,00:02:55,Better.
11,00:02:55,00:02:57,(rock music playing)
12,00:03:12,00:03:13,Grissom!
13,00:03:16,00:03:18,Grissom!
14,00:03:19,00:03:22,(panting): Grissom.
15,00:03:22,00:03:24,"What, are you taking a leak?"
16,00:03:25,00:03:28,The follow car is supposed to stay with the runner.
17,00:03:28,00:03:31,"We've been training for months, man."
18,00:03:32,00:03:33,20 CSIs.
19,00:03:33,00:03:36,120 miles.
20,00:03:36,00:03:39,Don't blame me. Blame him.
21,00:03:39,00:03:42,I saw his flasher from the road.
22,00:03:42,00:03:43,Good call.
23,00:03:43,00:03:44,Got a cut on his forehead.
24,00:03:44,00:03:45,Looks fresh.
25,00:03:46,00:03:49,But usually takes a couple of days for the corneas to cloud over.
26,00:03:49,00:03:52,The race just started.
27,00:03:52,00:03:53,L.A. County PD.
28,00:03:53,00:03:56,Special Enforcement Squad.
29,00:03:56,00:03:58,Badass.
30,00:03:59,00:04:00,Hardcore badass.
31,00:04:01,00:04:02,Give me some more light here.
32,00:04:02,00:04:05,That looks like a recent injury.
33,00:04:05,00:04:06,There's no scab.
34,00:04:06,00:04:07,Fight?
35,00:04:07,00:04:08,Maybe.
36,00:04:08,00:04:09,Would you give me your phone?
37,00:04:10,00:04:12,(phone beeps)
38,00:04:13,00:04:15,Uh...
39,00:04:15,00:04:17,"Uh, this is CSI Willows."
40,00:04:17,00:04:22,"I'm at Highway 160, halfway through Leg 16 of the Desert Relay."
41,00:04:23,00:04:26,"We got a 419, officer down."
42,00:04:26,00:04:28,Notify Captain Brass.
43,00:04:28,00:04:29,"Barehanded, huh?"
44,00:04:29,00:04:31,"Well, collect it or lose it."
45,00:04:31,00:04:35,Ten years ago nobody would've known the difference.
46,00:04:35,00:04:38,Ten years ago we wouldn't have been able to get DNA off that fiber.
47,00:04:38,00:04:40,I'll find something in the car to bindle it.
48,00:04:40,00:04:42,Time of discovery: 4:32.
49,00:04:42,00:04:45,I'll put it in the report.
50,00:04:45,00:04:47,(exhales)
51,00:04:47,00:04:49,So much for the race.
52,00:04:49,00:04:55,"Well, at least we didn't come in last."
53,00:05:54,00:05:56,So much for that shoe print.
54,00:05:58,00:06:00,This could be blood on this rock.
55,00:06:02,00:06:04,How many cops are in town this weekend?
56,00:06:04,00:06:05,"20,000."
57,00:06:05,00:06:08,And the road is closed to civilians.
58,00:06:08,00:06:10,Spring break with a badge.
59,00:06:11,00:06:13,"Well, this ought to be fun."
60,00:06:13,00:06:16,Every suspect's in law enforcement.
61,00:06:18,00:06:20,"So, how was your run?"
62,00:06:20,00:06:22,I'm still alive.
63,00:06:23,00:06:26,That's everything.
64,00:06:29,00:06:31,ATM receipt.
65,00:06:31,00:06:33,"No card, no cash?"
66,00:06:33,00:06:35,"Well, he was in a race."
67,00:06:35,00:06:37,Maybe someone took his wallet.
68,00:06:37,00:06:39,"So, Lieutenant Mendez, tell me about your teammate."
69,00:06:39,00:06:41,Tim Coleman.
70,00:06:41,00:06:42,Newest boot. Two months in.
71,00:06:42,00:06:44,Came right out of patrol.
72,00:06:44,00:06:46,Best cop at Carson Station.
73,00:06:46,00:06:48,"Well, I mean, he's got to be in shape."
74,00:06:48,00:06:49,I heard your training's as tough as SWAT.
75,00:06:49,00:06:50,SWAT's LAPD.
76,00:06:51,00:06:52,We're SES. We're better.
77,00:06:52,00:06:56,"Better conditioned, better prepared."
78,00:06:56,00:06:58,Those the best you got?
79,00:06:58,00:06:59,Yeah. Yeah. You got lucky.
80,00:06:59,00:07:01,"If they're not, I'll fly mine in."
81,00:07:01,00:07:02,(Brass chuckles)
82,00:07:02,00:07:07,"Let me put it to you this way, I'd want them investigating my murder."
83,00:07:07,00:07:14,"ROBBINS: Other than the fact that he's deceased, this guy is in excellent physical condition."
84,00:07:14,00:07:16,Except for that head wound.
85,00:07:16,00:07:18,"Eh, superficial."
86,00:07:18,00:07:20,Could be from a fall.
87,00:07:20,00:07:25,Your bloody rock may be incidental.
88,00:07:25,00:07:27,What about the bloody knuckles?
89,00:07:27,00:07:29,Injury on the back of his hand.
90,00:07:29,00:07:31,Maybe an altercation of some sort.
91,00:07:31,00:07:32,So cause of death?
92,00:07:32,00:07:34,No cerebral issues.
93,00:07:34,00:07:36,No primary indicators.
94,00:07:38,00:07:39,We go to the fallback position.
95,00:07:40,00:07:41,Cardiac arrest.
96,00:07:41,00:07:42,This guy was 25 years old.
97,00:07:42,00:07:44,Didn't say I was finished.
98,00:07:44,00:07:46,Clouded corneas tipped me off.
99,00:07:46,00:07:47,Look at the liver.
100,00:07:47,00:07:52,His serosal surfaces are unusually dry.
101,00:07:52,00:07:54,His urine was minimal and dark brown.
102,00:07:54,00:07:56,Dehydration.
103,00:07:56,00:07:59,"Well, the race isn't the only reason these guys come to town."
104,00:07:59,00:08:00,It's a good party.
105,00:08:00,00:08:02,"Too much running, too much partying?"
106,00:08:02,00:08:03,L.A. SES.
107,00:08:03,00:08:05,They go all out.
108,00:08:05,00:08:12,"Work hard, play hard, die young, leave a good-looking corpse."
109,00:08:12,00:08:14,WILLOWS: Grissom.
110,00:08:14,00:08:16,Tox came in.
111,00:08:16,00:08:21,Tim Coleman had 75 mics per mil of furosemide in his system.
112,00:08:21,00:08:23,Blood pressure medication?
113,00:08:23,00:08:26,There's no history of that in his medical records.
114,00:08:26,00:08:31,"And it's was a high dose, but not a lethal one."
115,00:08:31,00:08:32,But it is a diuretic.
116,00:08:32,00:08:35,Could explain the dehydration.
117,00:08:35,00:08:41,"And the drug can also cause muscle cramps, dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, restlessness."
118,00:08:41,00:08:44,That could explain how Tim Coleman ended up where he did.
119,00:08:44,00:08:47,How'd the furosemide get in his system in the first place?
120,00:08:49,00:08:51,"ANNOUNCER (over P.A.): Listen up, people."
121,00:08:51,00:08:55,...are one hour away and the party's raging here at the finish line.
122,00:08:55,00:08:58,Too bad you guys bet on the wrong horse.
123,00:08:59,00:09:01,Maybe you forgot.
124,00:09:01,00:09:04,One of our own died out there in the dirt.
125,00:09:04,00:09:07,"Yeah, I'll drink to his memory."
126,00:09:07,00:09:09,You want to make the toast?
127,00:09:09,00:09:11,Am I interrupting something?
128,00:09:11,00:09:12,No.
129,00:09:12,00:09:14,"Later, pogue."
130,00:09:17,00:09:20,"Um, are those bags brought in from the race?"
131,00:09:20,00:09:21,Yeah.
132,00:09:21,00:09:24,I'm going to need Tim Coleman's.
133,00:09:24,00:09:26,Sure.
134,00:09:28,00:09:33,"On the job, we come across a scene like this, we call them a bunch of degenerates."
135,00:09:33,00:09:35,We'd be rounding half these guys up.
136,00:09:35,00:09:37,I am not going to miss this.
137,00:09:37,00:09:38,You're not going to miss the competition?
138,00:09:38,00:09:40,I just made lieutenant.
139,00:09:40,00:09:42,I got nothing to prove anymore.
140,00:09:42,00:09:44,A man with nothing to prove.
141,00:09:44,00:09:46,Now that would be a first.
142,00:09:46,00:09:47,Got a second?
143,00:09:47,00:09:48,"Sure, what's up?"
144,00:09:48,00:09:50,"On a hunch, I ran a bank trace on Tim Coleman."
145,00:09:50,00:09:53,I got a hit.
146,00:09:53,00:09:56,"$300 withdrawal on his ATM card, 4:06 a.m. today."
147,00:09:57,00:09:59,That's about nine hours after he died.
148,00:09:59,00:10:00,"Good hunch, Grego."
149,00:10:00,00:10:01,Thanks.
150,00:10:02,00:10:04,I also got surveillance video from the bank.
151,00:10:04,00:10:08,This ATM's on the corner of Holyfield and Maryland Parkway.
152,00:10:08,00:10:13,"Since that's definitely not Tim Coleman, maybe it's our killer."
153,00:10:13,00:10:15,Or at least a thief.
154,00:10:15,00:10:17,"Well, all we got to do now is match a name with the face."
155,00:10:17,00:10:21,"Write up a description, send it off to Dispatch for broadcast."
156,00:10:25,00:10:28,There might be an easier way.
157,00:10:28,00:10:30,Huh?
158,00:10:35,00:10:39,HODGES: This is the thread you pulled off the runner's body.
159,00:10:39,00:10:41,GRISSOM: Natural fiber?
160,00:10:41,00:10:43,Mercerized cotton.
161,00:10:43,00:10:44,Extremely strong.
162,00:10:44,00:10:52,"Fibers are placed in a caustic solution, splitting the fibers apart and providing an increased surface area to absorb the dye."
163,00:10:52,00:10:55,"Once it dries, it's exponentially stronger."
164,00:10:55,00:10:58,This kind of thread is used in machine quilting and embroidery.
165,00:10:58,00:11:01,Like on a sports uniforms.
166,00:11:01,00:11:03,(cheering)
167,00:11:03,00:11:07,ANNOUNCER (over P.A.): 120 miles through Baker and SWAT and SES neck-and-neck.
168,00:11:07,00:11:09,(cheering)
169,00:11:13,00:11:15,SWAT and SES!
170,00:11:18,00:11:19,SWAT and SES!
171,00:11:19,00:11:22,LAPD SWAT wins the first time in eight years.
172,00:11:22,00:11:25,"Coming in at 13 hours, 24 minutes."
173,00:11:45,00:11:48,"For the last six years, I ran the toughest leg of the relay..."
174,00:11:48,00:11:50,against the same guy from SES.
175,00:11:50,00:11:51,"But this year, there was a new guy."
176,00:11:51,00:11:53,"Yeah, this cocky kid shows up."
177,00:11:53,00:11:54,You're my competition?
178,00:11:54,00:11:56,I thought this was supposed to be the hardest leg.
179,00:11:56,00:11:58,"Typical SES, all mouth."
180,00:11:58,00:11:58,What'd you do?
181,00:11:59,00:11:59,Ignored him.
182,00:11:59,00:12:01,Looks like you got in a fight?
183,00:12:01,00:12:02,"Hey, I was here to race."
184,00:12:02,00:12:04,He cold-cocked me. I never threw a punch.
185,00:12:04,00:12:07,We found red fibers on him that may match your jacket.
186,00:12:07,00:12:08,I'm SWAT. I subdued him.
187,00:12:08,00:12:11,(grunting)
188,00:12:12,00:12:14,Mind if we take your jacket to confirm?
189,00:12:14,00:12:15,Knock yourself out.
190,00:12:16,00:12:17,Not going to find any blood on it.
191,00:12:29,00:12:32,"Had a real good talk with your manager, Clyde."
192,00:12:32,00:12:34,How's Fast 'N Fresh treating you?
193,00:12:34,00:12:36,I'm up to $8.75 an hour.
194,00:12:37,00:12:40,"I guess this kind of beats saving up, huh?"
195,00:12:42,00:12:45,Look... is my wife here?
196,00:12:47,00:12:49,Is she behind the glass or something?
197,00:12:49,00:12:52,I'll be talking to her soon enough.
198,00:12:52,00:12:54,"Oh, come on, now. Is that really necessary?"
199,00:12:54,00:12:56,"I mean, I'm just a regular guy..."
200,00:12:56,00:12:59,"Hey, regular guys don't steal $300 with a dead cop's ATM card, man!"
201,00:12:59,00:13:01,Dead cop?! What are you talking about?
202,00:13:01,00:13:03,Those three bills-- that's-that's my money.
203,00:13:04,00:13:08,"All right, technically, it's my wife's, but..."
204,00:13:10,00:13:13,I sell this tight little Asian chick a $3 Tasty Meal.
205,00:13:13,00:13:17,"She says for $300, I can get a very tasty meal."
206,00:13:18,00:13:21,I was about to go on my break anyway.
207,00:13:23,00:13:26,"My wife's not behind that glass, right?"
208,00:13:26,00:13:30,VARTANN: Hotel security came up on a noise complaint.
209,00:13:30,00:13:33,Found two DBs.
210,00:13:33,00:13:36,"Room's registered to a uniform officer, Manny Senteno."
211,00:13:36,00:13:37,One of ours?
212,00:13:37,00:13:42,"Laughlin PD, but he carries tin, so that makes him family."
213,00:13:49,00:13:52,Female vic's Patricia Fielding.
214,00:13:52,00:13:56,Also PD. Bakersfield.
215,00:14:05,00:14:07,He check in alone?
216,00:14:07,00:14:09,"VARTANN: Yeah, day before yesterday."
217,00:14:09,00:14:12,"Issued one key, but his itemized bill shows lots of room service for two."
218,00:14:12,00:14:17,SIDLE: A wife or girlfriend would probably be on the register.
219,00:14:29,00:14:31,Looks like it's all his stuff.
220,00:14:31,00:14:33,I don't see a purse around here.
221,00:14:33,00:14:38,"Guy's away from home, unwinds with some opportunity sex..."
222,00:14:39,00:14:41,Looks like he came before he went.
223,00:14:44,00:14:47,"Glock 19, standard police issue."
224,00:14:49,00:14:52,There's something on the slide.
225,00:15:05,00:15:06,14 rounds left.
226,00:15:06,00:15:08,15-round magazine.
227,00:15:08,00:15:10,Any good cop keeps one racked in the chamber.
228,00:15:10,00:15:12,"Two bullets, two bodies."
229,00:15:12,00:15:13,Put it down!
230,00:15:13,00:15:14,You dare me?!
231,00:15:14,00:15:15,Put it down!
232,00:15:18,00:15:21,I'm thinking straight-up murder/suicide.
233,00:15:26,00:15:28,Tim Coleman's gym bag.
234,00:15:28,00:15:32,"Gym clothes, towel, vitamins, pocket knife."
235,00:15:34,00:15:38,"Protein bar wrapper, empty water bottle, banana peel."
236,00:15:38,00:15:39,Why the trash?
237,00:15:39,00:15:42,"Well, you know, there's a five-minute penalty if you litter the race course."
238,00:15:42,00:15:43,Oh.
239,00:15:43,00:15:46,What's the best way to get chemicals into your system?
240,00:15:46,00:15:48,Injection.
241,00:15:48,00:15:50,But there was no evidence of that. Second best?
242,00:15:50,00:15:51,Ingestion.
243,00:17:03,00:17:07,Trace amounts of furosemide in his water bottle.
244,00:17:07,00:17:09,Someone spiked his drink.
245,00:17:53,00:17:56,"Will Marshall, this is Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab. Hi."
246,00:17:56,00:18:01,There is something very wrong in the world if a woman like you is only handling test tubes.
247,00:18:01,00:18:04,"Well, if you think that's all I handle, you're not as smart as you think."
248,00:18:04,00:18:08,"So, you're the L.A. County team medic, right?"
249,00:18:08,00:18:12,That means you're responsible for making sure that all your teammates are well hydrated.
250,00:18:12,00:18:15,Yeah. Including Tim Coleman.
251,00:18:16,00:18:18,"Yeah. Hell of a thing, that."
252,00:18:18,00:18:21,You're currently #1 on the SES's transfer list.
253,00:18:21,00:18:26,"Same spot you were two months ago when they bypassed you to transfer in Tim Coleman, right?"
254,00:18:26,00:18:28,Six months I'm on the top of the list.
255,00:18:28,00:18:32,"January 31 comes, and they reach over me and take Coleman."
256,00:18:32,00:18:34,That's the cutoff date to run in the race.
257,00:18:34,00:18:36,Coleman was a ringer.
258,00:18:36,00:18:37,Ding-ding.
259,00:18:37,00:18:39,"SES transferred him in for speed, not skill."
260,00:18:39,00:18:41,Might not be another opening for years.
261,00:18:41,00:18:43,I'm not getting any younger.
262,00:18:43,00:18:47,"And after all of that, Coleman doesn't even run."
263,00:18:47,00:18:49,He had a good excuse.
264,00:18:49,00:18:51,Did you give it to him?
265,00:18:51,00:18:55,"If I'm going to kill a guy, I'm not going to do it with 20,000 cops around."
266,00:18:56,00:18:57,Well...
267,00:18:57,00:19:00,sounds like you've been giving it some serious thought.
268,00:19:00,00:19:01,"Well, every cop does."
269,00:19:01,00:19:03,My way?
270,00:19:03,00:19:06,A sniper shot... 200 meters out.
271,00:19:06,00:19:37,"Coleman'd never even hear the ""am"" in ""blam."" Okay?"
272,00:19:46,00:19:50,"Mrs. Senteno, is this your husband?"
273,00:19:50,00:19:53,He doesn't wear his hair like that.
274,00:19:55,00:19:59,"There's some forms for you to sign, then we can talk in the lounge."
275,00:19:59,00:20:01,What happened?
276,00:20:01,00:20:06,"Mrs. Senteno, we haven't finished our investigation yet, but your husband died from a gunshot wound."
277,00:20:06,00:20:07,Who shot him?
278,00:20:07,00:20:09,We don't know.
279,00:20:09,00:20:11,Where was he found?
280,00:20:12,00:20:14,In his hotel room.
281,00:20:21,00:20:24,"He wasn't alone, was he?"
282,00:20:25,00:20:27,No.
283,00:20:27,00:20:29,I married a cop.
284,00:20:29,00:20:33,With that comes alcohol and women to take the edge off.
285,00:20:33,00:20:38,First time... he said it meant nothing.
286,00:20:38,00:20:41,He promised never to do it again.
287,00:20:41,00:20:46,By the third time... I told him to stop confessing.
288,00:20:46,00:20:49,I wasn't going anywhere.
289,00:20:50,00:20:52,"Don't ask, don't tell."
290,00:20:52,00:20:57,I wasn't willing to trade my family for the flavor of the month.
291,00:20:57,00:21:00,That doesn't make me pathetic.
292,00:21:07,00:21:09,What happened?
293,00:21:09,00:21:10,Break the bad news to the wife?
294,00:21:10,00:21:11,"Oh, I didn't have to."
295,00:21:11,00:21:13,"(sighs): Women always know, huh?"
296,00:21:13,00:21:15,Not always. I think so.
297,00:21:16,00:21:17,Women always know when the man is straying.
298,00:21:17,00:21:19,"What are you, the voice of experience?"
299,00:21:19,00:21:21,(laughs): No. I'm a really nice guy.
300,00:21:21,00:21:23,"Oh, I believe you."
301,00:21:23,00:21:24,"Well, you need to believe this."
302,00:21:24,00:21:26,There was one bullet in each of the bodies.
303,00:21:26,00:21:28,They both came from the Glock.
304,00:21:28,00:21:34,"And the prints on the Glock are from a female, so it's still looking like a murder/suicide."
305,00:21:34,00:21:36,All right.
306,00:21:36,00:21:38,Hey. You anywhere on my fibers?
307,00:21:38,00:21:41,I'm dealing with a lot of things today.
308,00:21:41,00:21:45,My phone has been ringing off the hook.
309,00:21:45,00:21:49,CSI is taking a ton of crap because we didn't finish the race. There was a dead cop in the desert.
310,00:21:49,00:22:01,"That's what I kept telling them, and they tell me, ""Good excuse."" The white fibers found on the gun slide is tissue: the common nose-picking variety with gun oil residue."
311,00:22:02,00:22:05,Are you saying that the gun was wiped down and the prints were planted?
312,00:22:08,00:22:10,"No, you're saying that."
313,00:22:10,00:22:11,I don't get to say that.
314,00:22:11,00:22:15,But somebody else could've pulled the trigger.
315,00:22:19,00:22:25,"FRANCO: Manny Sentero's prints are all over the room, including the champagne bottle and one of the glasses."
316,00:22:25,00:22:26,What about Patricia Fielding's?
317,00:22:26,00:22:28,"Hotel room door, inside knob."
318,00:22:28,00:22:29,And the murder weapon.
319,00:22:29,00:22:31,That's it?
320,00:22:32,00:22:33,Are you sure?
321,00:22:34,00:22:35,I-I'm sorry.
322,00:22:35,00:22:37,It just doesn't make any sense.
323,00:22:37,00:22:39,"The sex kits came back negative, and now this."
324,00:22:39,00:22:40,"I mean, that room reeked of musk."
325,00:22:40,00:22:43,"Well, maybe he swapped fluids with someone else."
326,00:22:43,00:22:45,There was a third set of prints.
327,00:22:45,00:22:46,I ran it through AFIS.
328,00:22:46,00:22:49,Got a hit on a cop.
329,00:22:49,00:22:50,Another one.
330,00:22:50,00:22:52,"SIDLE: Lydia Lopez, Bakersfield PD."
331,00:22:52,00:22:55,That's the same division as Patricia Fielding's.
332,00:22:55,00:23:02,"Well, according to Histology, Tim Coleman's muscle cells were hyper-hydrated, yet his body was dehydrated."
333,00:23:02,00:23:05,"Well, that condition's normally associated with drug abuse."
334,00:23:05,00:23:09,"Right. But apart from the furosemide, his tox was negative."
335,00:23:09,00:23:12,"So, I took another look at the guy."
336,00:23:13,00:23:15,"Buff, cut, aggressive."
337,00:23:16,00:23:18,Made me think steroids.
338,00:23:18,00:23:21,"Kind of risky for a cop, considering they're subject to random drug tests."
339,00:23:21,00:23:23,"Well, steroids are controlled, but creatine isn't."
340,00:23:24,00:23:27,It's a legal way to bulk up.
341,00:23:28,00:23:31,Tim Coleman was using it.
342,00:23:31,00:23:35,Creatine pulls the potassium from the blood and moves it into the muscles.
343,00:23:38,00:23:40,Dehydrating the body in the process.
344,00:23:40,00:23:46,"Exactly. And you add furosemide to it, and you get a severe electrolyte imbalance."
345,00:23:46,00:23:49,"Leading to arrhythmia, and consequently cardiac arrest."
346,00:23:55,00:23:58,"So, what's our problem?"
347,00:23:58,00:23:59,The dose.
348,00:23:59,00:24:04,There wasn't enough furosemide in the water to make that happen.
349,00:24:12,00:24:14,Lydia Lopez-- the girl next door.
350,00:24:15,00:24:16,(knocking)
351,00:24:16,00:24:18,CSI. Hello.
352,00:24:18,00:24:23,Her division captain wants every professional courtesy extended to her.
353,00:24:35,00:24:37,Interesting.
354,00:24:37,00:24:38,Yeah.
355,00:24:42,00:24:44,Her clothes are still here.
356,00:24:44,00:24:49,"But I guess if you offed two people, you're not going to stick around to pack."
357,00:24:53,00:24:54,Adjoining door's open.
358,00:24:54,00:24:56,Maybe they wanted it that way.
359,00:24:56,00:24:58,"So, Manny and Lydia were boning."
360,00:24:59,00:25:01,How does Patricia Fielding fit in?
361,00:25:01,00:25:02,I don't know.
362,00:25:02,00:25:04,Isn't the prevailing male fantasy two on one?
363,00:25:06,00:25:09,"So, let's say three of them were going at it."
364,00:25:09,00:25:12,How did two out of three end up dead?
365,00:25:12,00:25:17,"Well, if Lydia said no, and Manny went for it anyway..."
366,00:25:22,00:25:26,"Well, someone was pissed."
367,00:25:26,00:25:30,"This is, like, a two, $300 La Perla nightie, ripped to shreds."
368,00:25:30,00:25:31,"Oh, looks comfortable."
369,00:25:31,00:25:34,It's not designed to stay on that long.
370,00:25:42,00:25:44,This is a man's wedding ring.
371,00:25:45,00:25:46,(phone ringing)
372,00:25:48,00:25:49,Yeah.
373,00:25:49,00:25:54,Manny was wearing a ring.
374,00:25:54,00:25:55,Was Lydia Lopez married?
375,00:25:55,00:25:57,I'll ask her.
376,00:25:57,00:25:59,She walked into LVPD ten minutes ago.
377,00:26:00,00:26:05,"My CO calls and tells me that Patty Fielding's been murdered, and you're about to broadcast a citywide for my 20."
378,00:26:05,00:26:07,What the hell's going on in this town?
379,00:26:07,00:26:09,That's what we'd like to know.
380,00:26:09,00:26:11,I hope you've got your story straight.
381,00:26:11,00:26:13,Didn't know I needed one.
382,00:26:13,00:26:18,Patricia Fielding was killed in the room adjoining yours.
383,00:26:19,00:26:22,Manny's room?
384,00:26:22,00:26:23,Where's Manny?
385,00:26:23,00:26:26,Manny's on a slab next to Patricia.
386,00:26:35,00:26:38,"Look, we know that you and Manny were together."
387,00:26:38,00:26:41,Once a year for seven years running.
388,00:26:41,00:26:43,Desert Relay is our time together.
389,00:26:44,00:26:46,Then we go back to our lives.
390,00:26:46,00:26:47,That's sweet.
391,00:26:47,00:26:50,What was Sergeant Fielding doing in your lover's room?
392,00:26:50,00:26:51,I don't know.
393,00:26:51,00:26:52,You don't know.
394,00:26:52,00:26:55,"You know, I heard that Manny Senteno was a real player."
395,00:26:55,00:26:57,"Maybe he moved on, and you didn't like that."
396,00:26:57,00:26:58,Who told you that?
397,00:26:58,00:27:00,Manny doesn't mess around.
398,00:27:00,00:27:01,Except with you.
399,00:27:01,00:27:03,Yes.
400,00:27:03,00:27:05,How could you know that if the only part you know is his body?
401,00:27:05,00:27:07,"Pedestal's a little high, don't you think?"
402,00:27:07,00:27:10,"Your best friend, your lover are dead."
403,00:27:10,00:27:12,What do you expect me to think?
404,00:27:12,00:27:13,I don't know what happened.
405,00:27:13,00:27:17,I do know that Manny loves his wife just like I love my husband.
406,00:27:17,00:27:19,It's just an itch we scratched every 12 months.
407,00:27:19,00:27:20,It doesn't mean anything.
408,00:27:20,00:27:22,It meant enough to someone to trash your room.
409,00:27:22,00:27:24,Archie.
410,00:27:24,00:27:26,Archie-- your husband.
411,00:27:26,00:27:27,Mm-hmm.
412,00:27:27,00:27:28,Did he catch the two of you together?
413,00:27:28,00:27:32,No. He wasn't even supposed to be in Vegas.
414,00:27:32,00:27:33,This is my time.
415,00:27:33,00:27:34,I heard he was looking for me.
416,00:27:34,00:27:36,He must've got a key from the front desk.
417,00:27:36,00:27:39,Probably took one look at the room and went ballistic.
418,00:27:39,00:27:41,Did you see what he did to my teddy?
419,00:27:42,00:27:44,That was Archie's gift to me.
420,00:27:44,00:27:51,"Hey, most husbands who buy lingerie expect that they're the ones who're going to be enjoying it."
421,00:27:51,00:27:53,I look good in it.
422,00:27:54,00:27:56,Archie didn't do this.
423,00:27:57,00:27:58,He couldn't.
424,00:28:02,00:28:07,The manager says Clyde Grimes took a break around 3:00.
425,00:28:07,00:28:10,That's consistent with bank records.
426,00:28:10,00:28:15,$300 withdraw to Clyde's account registered at 3:06.
427,00:28:15,00:28:20,But the video shows him using Tim Coleman's card at 4:06.
428,00:28:21,00:28:22,"Yeah, one hour later."
429,00:28:22,00:28:28,"Well, maybe I'm not the only one who gets screwed up by Daylight Savings Time."
430,00:28:28,00:28:31,What if the ATM and the camera were out of synch?
431,00:28:31,00:28:34,How? The camera's part of the ATM.
432,00:28:34,00:28:36,Video is controlled by the branch office.
433,00:28:36,00:28:38,ATM connects to the national network.
434,00:28:38,00:28:39,Separate systems.
435,00:28:39,00:28:41,If the clocks weren't synchronized...
436,00:28:41,00:28:46,Then the guy who used Tim Coleman's card should be on video one hour later.
437,00:28:57,00:29:01,"He's, uh, emptying the ATM."
438,00:31:31,00:31:33,"Hey, is everybody all right?"
439,00:31:33,00:31:35,"Hey, you stupid jackass!"
440,00:31:35,00:31:36,I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.
441,00:31:36,00:31:37,"Yo, yo, where's the fire, my man?"
442,00:31:37,00:31:40,(grunting)
443,00:31:48,00:31:50,Ha!
444,00:31:52,00:31:53,No wonder you were in a hurry.
445,00:31:56,00:32:02,"STOKES: Well, Mr. Drake, I suppose this is one way to make eight years in an injection molding factory pay off."
446,00:32:02,00:32:04,You're certainly good with plastics.
447,00:32:11,00:32:13,STOKES: It was a good scam.
448,00:32:13,00:32:18,"Your reader transmits the card number to you, and the camera records the sucker's PIN number."
449,00:32:20,00:32:21,I should have used better transmitters.
450,00:32:22,00:32:23,I wouldn't have had to stick so close.
451,00:32:23,00:32:28,"You raked in over $13,000 off 62 skimmed accounts."
452,00:32:28,00:32:29,That was just the first two days.
453,00:32:30,00:32:31,And I checked the bank records.
454,00:32:31,00:32:34,All of the cards you stole belonged to cops.
455,00:32:34,00:32:37,I know.
456,00:32:37,00:32:39,"You know, I'm facing multiple felony counts here."
457,00:32:39,00:32:42,"Comprehensive theft, card fraud."
458,00:32:42,00:32:44,I'm going away for years.
459,00:32:44,00:32:46,Everyone here knows that.
460,00:32:46,00:32:51,"But when I got booked, they wrote me up for two moving violations."
461,00:32:52,00:32:54,I hate cops.
462,00:32:56,00:32:58,I picked up Lydia Lopez's husband at Cheetah's.
463,00:32:58,00:32:59,He was groping the strippers.
464,00:32:59,00:33:01,Classic drunk-and-disorderly.
465,00:33:01,00:33:04,"When I got there, the bouncer was just about to tune him up."
466,00:33:04,00:33:05,For what?
467,00:33:05,00:33:07,Yakking on his suit. (laughs)
468,00:33:11,00:33:12,(man coughing)
469,00:33:12,00:33:14,VARTANN: Archie Lopez.
470,00:33:18,00:33:19,So what?
471,00:33:19,00:33:24,"BROWN: Your prints were found in your wife's hotel room, including the doorknob to the adjoining room."
472,00:33:24,00:33:26,Yeah.
473,00:33:26,00:33:28,Patricia Fielding was killed in that room.
474,00:33:28,00:33:30,So was Manny Senteno.
475,00:33:30,00:33:32,Hmm. My heart bleeds.
476,00:33:32,00:33:33,Are you still drunk?
477,00:33:33,00:33:34,(laughs)
478,00:33:34,00:33:38,"Yeah, I'm probably still drunk, yeah."
479,00:33:38,00:33:39,Must have been the tequila.
480,00:33:39,00:33:40,I don't drink that much.
481,00:33:40,00:33:42,"Well, it takes a lot of drinking to forget a murder."
482,00:33:42,00:33:45,(man coughing)
483,00:33:45,00:33:47,I didn't kill anyone.
484,00:33:47,00:33:50,I wanted to surprise Lydia.
485,00:33:50,00:33:54,Manager gave me a key.
486,00:34:02,00:34:04,And then I left.
487,00:34:04,00:34:05,Where did you go?
488,00:34:05,00:34:07,I went to the hotel bar.
489,00:34:10,00:34:14,That's where I saw Patty.
490,00:34:14,00:34:16,That woman's been to my house.
491,00:34:16,00:34:18,She's eaten my food.
492,00:34:18,00:34:21,"She smiled in my face, all the time..."
493,00:34:21,00:34:23,All the time knowing that Lydia was banging someone else.
494,00:34:23,00:34:25,(laughs)
495,00:34:25,00:34:27,"So, where did you go then?"
496,00:34:29,00:34:31,I went somewhere else.
497,00:34:31,00:34:32,I drank some more.
498,00:34:32,00:34:33,I drank...
499,00:34:33,00:34:34,"A lot, I guess. I don't..."
500,00:34:34,00:34:36,I don't remember anything.
501,00:34:36,00:34:39,We're going to need your clothes.
502,00:34:46,00:34:48,Tim Coleman drank from this bottle.
503,00:34:48,00:34:50,What does this look like to you?
504,00:35:04,00:35:06,Backwash.
505,00:36:00,00:36:04,"MENDEZ: You know, I don't appreciate being kept in the dark this long."
506,00:36:04,00:36:08,We don't release details of our investigation until we're sure of our facts.
507,00:36:08,00:36:10,Now we're sure.
508,00:36:10,00:36:14,Tim Coleman died of a drug-induced cardiac arrest.
509,00:36:14,00:36:17,"If I'd known he was on drugs, he'd never have gotten into SES."
510,00:36:17,00:36:19,"Actually, he was only on one drug."
511,00:36:19,00:36:20,Creatine.
512,00:36:20,00:36:22,Youmade it plural.
513,00:36:22,00:36:27,You gave him a protein bar that was laced with furosemide.
514,00:36:28,00:36:31,"Hey, you got to keep up your strength."
515,00:36:31,00:36:33,Don't make us look bad.
516,00:36:35,00:36:37,The combination of the two drugs is what killed him.
517,00:36:38,00:36:40,I want my union rep.
518,00:36:40,00:36:42,That's your right.
519,00:36:42,00:36:44,We're going to need to see your pocketknife.
520,00:36:44,00:36:45,"On the table, please."
521,00:37:04,00:37:06,I said I want my union rep.
522,00:37:06,00:37:08,We're done here.
523,00:37:37,00:37:38,(computer beeping lightly)
524,00:37:59,00:38:03,SIDLE: Archie Lopez's clothes are negative for GSR and blood.
525,00:38:03,00:38:05,Ditto on his personal effects.
526,00:38:05,00:38:10,But I know Archie was in Manny's room because he has Manny's luggage tag.
527,00:38:10,00:38:12,Guy wants to find out who was sticking it to his wife.
528,00:38:13,00:38:16,Is there an address and phone number on that?
529,00:38:16,00:38:20,"Yeah. What do guys do when they're drunk, and they have a number burning a hole in their pocket?"
530,00:38:29,00:38:32,He called this number six times.
531,00:38:36,00:38:38,The last call was 12 minutes.
532,00:38:38,00:38:42,Maybe Archie found someone who can share his pain.
533,00:38:47,00:38:52,SIDLE: It must be very hard to hear that your husband's been cheating on you.
534,00:38:53,00:38:56,We've been through this.
535,00:38:56,00:38:59,I didn't care about Manny's indiscretions.
536,00:38:59,00:39:02,Even when you hear about it from the other woman's husband?
537,00:39:03,00:39:04,Archie Lopez called you.
538,00:39:04,00:39:06,So I talked to him on the phone.
539,00:39:06,00:39:07,He was drunk.
540,00:39:07,00:39:09,He was raving.
541,00:39:09,00:39:11,I didn't understand half of what he said.
542,00:39:11,00:39:13,I think you heard him loud and clear.
543,00:39:13,00:39:15,"You got in your car, and you tore ass to Vegas."
544,00:39:15,00:39:17,I was in Laughlin with my son.
545,00:39:17,00:39:21,Highway Patrol caught you speeding on Interstate 15.
546,00:39:21,00:39:22,Southbound.
547,00:39:24,00:39:27,Most cops won't issue tickets to fellow cops or their families.
548,00:39:27,00:39:28,Professional courtesy.
549,00:39:28,00:39:30,But your tag still gets logged.
550,00:39:30,00:39:35,You were leaving Las Vegas before you even found out that your husband was dead.
551,00:39:37,00:39:39,I don't understand what you're talking about.
552,00:39:41,00:39:43,"Yeah, you do."
553,00:39:46,00:39:48,"Oh, you bastard."
554,00:39:54,00:39:56,You can't prove that.
555,00:39:58,00:40:01,"Well, that's why we got a warrant to search your house."
556,00:40:01,00:40:06,And we found Patricia Fielding's blood in the lining of your purse.
557,00:40:06,00:40:10,From the tissue that you used to wipe the gun.
558,00:40:20,00:40:22,She was nothing.
559,00:40:25,00:40:29,He jeopardized our family for that?
560,00:40:30,00:40:32,Not for her.
561,00:40:34,00:40:37,Patricia wasn't the one having the affair with your husband.
562,00:40:37,00:40:38,Oh.
563,00:40:38,00:40:39,(sniffles)
564,00:40:39,00:40:41,I caught her with him.
565,00:40:43,00:40:46,She answered the door like she belonged there.
566,00:40:47,00:40:50,"Mrs. Senteno, you killed the wrong woman."
567,00:40:51,00:40:53,"MANNY: Wendy, it's not what you think."
568,00:40:53,00:40:55,(gunshot)
569,00:41:13,00:41:15,Where's your kit?
570,00:41:15,00:41:17,"Actually, we have all the evidence we need."
571,00:41:20,00:41:23,Then what the hell are you doing here?
572,00:41:23,00:41:25,I have a question.
573,00:41:25,00:41:28,Off the record.
574,00:41:31,00:41:34,I wasn't trying to kill him.
575,00:41:34,00:41:36,Then why did you do this?
576,00:41:39,00:41:41,Leg 16 was mine.
577,00:41:41,00:41:45,I ran it eight years in a row.
578,00:41:45,00:41:47,I won every time.
579,00:41:48,00:41:53,"Then the bosses transfer in that kid, kick me upstairs, and give him my race."
580,00:41:55,00:41:57,No way I was going to let him do better than me.
581,00:42:00,00:42:04,"Sooner or later, everybody gets replaced."
582,00:42:04,00:42:08,Talk to me when it happens to you.
