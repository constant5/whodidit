0	00:02:31	00:02:33	What the hell kind of music is that?
1	00:02:34	00:02:36	Inspiration.
2	00:02:36	00:02:39	Sedative.
3	00:02:39	00:02:40	Okay. ( changes radio station )
4	00:02:43	00:02:44	How's this?
5	00:02:45	00:02:49	How about something that doesn't twang?
6	00:02:53	00:02:55	Better.
7	00:03:12	00:03:13	Grissom!
8	00:03:16	00:03:18	Grissom!
9	00:03:19	00:03:22	Grissom.
10	00:03:22	00:03:24	What, are you taking a leak?
11	00:03:25	00:03:28	The follow car is supposed to stay with the runner.
12	00:03:28	00:03:31	We've been training for months, man.
13	00:03:32	00:03:33	20 CSIs.
14	00:03:33	00:03:36	120 miles.
15	00:03:36	00:03:39	Don't blame me. Blame him.
16	00:03:39	00:03:42	I saw his flasher from the road.
17	00:03:42	00:03:43	Good call.
18	00:03:43	00:03:44	Got a cut on his forehead.
19	00:03:44	00:03:45	Looks fresh.
20	00:03:46	00:03:49	But usually takes a couple of days for the corneas to cloud over.
21	00:03:49	00:03:52	The race just started.
22	00:03:52	00:03:53	L.A. County PD.
23	00:03:53	00:03:56	Special Enforcement Squad.
24	00:03:56	00:03:58	Badass.
25	00:03:59	00:04:00	Hardcore badass.
26	00:04:01	00:04:02	Give me some more light here.
27	00:04:02	00:04:05	That looks like a recent injury.
28	00:04:05	00:04:06	There's no scab.
29	00:04:06	00:04:07	Fight?
30	00:04:07	00:04:08	Maybe.
31	00:04:08	00:04:09	Would you give me your phone?
32	00:04:13	00:04:15	Uh...
33	00:04:15	00:04:17	Uh, this is CSI Willows.
34	00:04:17	00:04:22	I'm at Highway 160, halfway through Leg 16 of the Desert Relay.
35	00:04:23	00:04:26	We got a 419, officer down.
36	00:04:26	00:04:28	Notify Captain Brass.
37	00:04:28	00:04:29	Barehanded, huh?
38	00:04:29	00:04:31	Well, collect it or lose it.
39	00:04:31	00:04:35	Ten years ago nobody would've known the difference.
40	00:04:35	00:04:38	Ten years ago we wouldn't have been able to get DNA off that fiber.
41	00:04:38	00:04:40	I'll find something in the car to bindle it.
42	00:04:40	00:04:45	4 I'll put it in the report.
43	00:04:47	00:04:49	So much for the race.
44	00:04:49	00:04:55	Well, at least we didn't come in last.
45	00:05:54	00:05:56	So much for that shoe print.
46	00:05:58	00:06:00	This could be blood on this rock.
47	00:06:02	00:06:04	How many cops are in town this weekend?
48	00:06:04	00:06:05	20,000.
49	00:06:05	00:06:08	And the road is closed to civilians.
50	00:06:08	00:06:10	Spring break with a badge.
51	00:06:11	00:06:13	Well, this ought to be fun.
52	00:06:13	00:06:16	Every suspect's in law enforcement.
53	00:06:18	00:06:20	So, how was your run?
54	00:06:20	00:06:22	I'm still alive.
55	00:06:23	00:06:26	That's everything.
56	00:06:29	00:06:31	ATM receipt.
57	00:06:31	00:06:33	No card, no cash?
58	00:06:33	00:06:35	Well, he was in a race.
59	00:06:35	00:06:37	Maybe someone took his wallet.
60	00:06:37	00:06:39	So, Lieutenant Mendez, tell me about your teammate.
61	00:06:39	00:06:41	Tim Coleman.
62	00:06:41	00:06:42	Newest boot. Two months in.
63	00:06:42	00:06:44	Came right out of patrol.
64	00:06:44	00:06:46	Best cop at Carson Station.
65	00:06:46	00:06:48	Well, I mean, he's got to be in shape.
66	00:06:48	00:06:49	I heard your training's as tough as SWAT.
67	00:06:49	00:06:50	SWAT's LAPD.
68	00:06:51	00:06:52	We're SES. We're better.
69	00:06:52	00:06:56	Better conditioned, better prepared.
70	00:06:56	00:06:58	Those the best you got?
71	00:06:58	00:06:59	Yeah. Yeah. You got lucky.
72	00:06:59	00:07:01	If they're not, I'll fly mine in.
73	00:07:02	00:07:07	Let me put it to you this way, I'd want them investigating my murder.
74	00:07:07	00:07:14	Other than the fact that he's deceased, this guy is in excellent physical condition.
75	00:07:14	00:07:16	Except for that head wound.
76	00:07:16	00:07:18	Eh, superficial.
77	00:07:18	00:07:20	Could be from a fall.
78	00:07:20	00:07:25	Your bloody rock may be incidental.
79	00:07:25	00:07:27	What about the bloody knuckles?
80	00:07:27	00:07:29	Injury on the back of his hand.
81	00:07:29	00:07:31	Maybe an altercation of some sort.
82	00:07:31	00:07:32	So cause of death?
83	00:07:32	00:07:34	No cerebral issues.
84	00:07:34	00:07:36	No primary indicators.
85	00:07:38	00:07:39	We go to the fallback position.
86	00:07:40	00:07:41	Cardiac arrest.
87	00:07:41	00:07:42	This guy was 25 years old.
88	00:07:42	00:07:44	Didn't say I was finished.
89	00:07:44	00:07:46	Clouded corneas tipped me off.
90	00:07:46	00:07:47	Look at the liver.
91	00:07:47	00:07:52	His serosal surfaces are unusually dry.
92	00:07:52	00:07:54	His urine was minimal and dark brown.
93	00:07:54	00:07:56	Dehydration.
94	00:07:56	00:07:59	Well, the race isn't the only reason these guys come to town.
95	00:07:59	00:08:00	It's a good party.
96	00:08:00	00:08:02	Too much running, too much partying?
97	00:08:02	00:08:03	L.A. SES.
98	00:08:03	00:08:05	They go all out.
99	00:08:05	00:08:12	Work hard, play hard, die young, leave a good-looking corpse.
100	00:08:12	00:08:14	Grissom.
101	00:08:14	00:08:16	Tox came in.
102	00:08:16	00:08:21	Tim Coleman had 75 mics per mil of furosemide in his system.
103	00:08:21	00:08:23	Blood pressure medication?
104	00:08:23	00:08:26	There's no history of that in his medical records.
105	00:08:26	00:08:31	And it's was a high dose, but not a lethal one.
106	00:08:31	00:08:32	But it is a diuretic.
107	00:08:32	00:08:35	Could explain the dehydration.
108	00:08:35	00:08:41	And the drug can also cause muscle cramps, dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, restlessness.
109	00:08:41	00:08:44	That could explain how Tim Coleman ended up where he did.
110	00:08:44	00:08:47	How'd the furosemide get in his system in the first place?
111	00:08:49	00:08:51	Listen up, people.
112	00:08:51	00:08:55	...are one hour away and the party's raging here at the finish line.
113	00:08:55	00:08:58	Too bad you guys bet on the wrong horse.
114	00:08:59	00:09:01	Maybe you forgot.
115	00:09:01	00:09:04	One of our own died out there in the dirt.
116	00:09:04	00:09:07	Yeah, I'll drink to his memory.
117	00:09:07	00:09:09	You want to make the toast?
118	00:09:09	00:09:11	Am I interrupting something?
119	00:09:11	00:09:12	No.
120	00:09:12	00:09:14	Later, pogue.
121	00:09:17	00:09:20	Um, are those bags brought in from the race?
122	00:09:20	00:09:21	Yeah.
123	00:09:21	00:09:24	I'm going to need Tim Coleman's.
124	00:09:24	00:09:26	Sure.
125	00:09:28	00:09:33	On the job, we come across a scene like this, we call them a bunch of degenerates.
126	00:09:33	00:09:35	We'd be rounding half these guys up.
127	00:09:35	00:09:37	I am not going to miss this.
128	00:09:37	00:09:38	You're not going to miss the competition?
129	00:09:38	00:09:40	I just made lieutenant.
130	00:09:40	00:09:42	I got nothing to prove anymore.
131	00:09:42	00:09:44	A man with nothing to prove.
132	00:09:44	00:09:46	Now that would be a first.
133	00:09:46	00:09:47	Got a second?
134	00:09:47	00:09:48	Sure, what's up?
135	00:09:48	00:09:50	On a hunch, I ran a bank trace on Tim Coleman.
136	00:09:50	00:09:53	I got a hit.
137	00:09:53	00:09:56	$300 withdrawal on his ATM card, 06 a.m. today.
138	00:09:57	00:09:59	That's about nine hours after he died.
139	00:09:59	00:10:00	Good hunch, Grego.
140	00:10:00	00:10:01	Thanks.
141	00:10:02	00:10:04	I also got surveillance video from the bank.
142	00:10:04	00:10:08	This ATM's on the corner of Holyfield and Maryland Parkway.
143	00:10:08	00:10:13	Since that's definitely not Tim Coleman, maybe it's our killer.
144	00:10:13	00:10:15	Or at least a thief.
145	00:10:15	00:10:17	Well, all we got to do now is match a name with the face.
146	00:10:17	00:10:21	Write up a description, send it off to Dispatch for broadcast.
147	00:10:25	00:10:28	There might be an easier way.
148	00:10:28	00:10:30	Huh?
149	00:10:35	00:10:39	This is the thread you pulled off the runner's body.
150	00:10:39	00:10:41	Natural fiber?
151	00:10:41	00:10:43	Mercerized cotton.
152	00:10:43	00:10:44	Extremely strong.
153	00:10:44	00:10:52	Fibers are placed in a caustic solution, splitting the fibers apart and providing an increased surface area to absorb the dye.
154	00:10:52	00:10:55	Once it dries, it's exponentially stronger.
155	00:10:55	00:10:58	This kind of thread is used in machine quilting and embroidery.
156	00:10:58	00:11:01	Like on a sports uniforms.
157	00:11:03	00:11:07	120 miles through Baker and SWAT and SES neck-and-neck.
158	00:11:13	00:11:15	SWAT and SES!
159	00:11:18	00:11:19	SWAT and SES!
160	00:11:19	00:11:22	LAPD SWAT wins the first time in eight years.
161	00:11:22	00:11:25	Coming in at 13 hours, 24 minutes.
162	00:11:45	00:11:48	For the last six years, I ran the toughest leg of the relay...
163	00:11:48	00:11:50	against the same guy from SES.
164	00:11:50	00:11:51	But this year, there was a new guy.
165	00:11:51	00:11:53	Yeah, this cocky kid shows up.
166	00:11:53	00:11:54	You're my competition?
167	00:11:54	00:11:56	I thought this was supposed to be the hardest leg.
168	00:11:56	00:11:58	Typical SES, all mouth.
169	00:11:58	00:11:58	What'd you do?
170	00:11:59	00:11:59	Ignored him.
171	00:11:59	00:12:01	Looks like you got in a fight?
172	00:12:01	00:12:02	Hey, I was here to race.
173	00:12:02	00:12:04	He cold-cocked me. I never threw a punch.
174	00:12:04	00:12:07	We found red fibers on him that may match your jacket.
175	00:12:07	00:12:08	I'm SWAT. I subdued him.
176	00:12:12	00:12:14	Mind if we take your jacket to confirm?
177	00:12:14	00:12:15	Knock yourself out.
178	00:12:16	00:12:17	Not going to find any blood on it.
179	00:12:29	00:12:32	Had a real good talk with your manager, Clyde.
180	00:12:32	00:12:34	How's Fast 'N Fresh treating you?
181	00:12:34	00:12:36	I'm up to $8.75 an hour.
182	00:12:37	00:12:40	I guess this kind of beats saving up, huh?
183	00:12:42	00:12:45	Look... is my wife here?
184	00:12:47	00:12:49	Is she behind the glass or something?
185	00:12:49	00:12:52	I'll be talking to her soon enough.
186	00:12:52	00:12:54	Oh, come on, now. Is that really necessary?
187	00:12:54	00:12:56	I mean, I'm just a regular guy...
188	00:12:56	00:12:59	Hey, regular guys don't steal $300 with a dead cop's ATM card, man!
189	00:12:59	00:13:01	Dead cop?! What are you talking about?
190	00:13:01	00:13:03	Those three bills-- that's-that's my money.
191	00:13:04	00:13:08	All right, technically, it's my wife's, but...
192	00:13:10	00:13:13	I sell this tight little Asian chick a $3 Tasty Meal.
193	00:13:13	00:13:17	She says for $300, I can get a very tasty meal.
194	00:13:18	00:13:21	I was about to go on my break anyway.
195	00:13:23	00:13:26	My wife's not behind that glass, right?
196	00:13:26	00:13:30	Hotel security came up on a noise complaint.
197	00:13:30	00:13:33	Found two DBs.
198	00:13:33	00:13:36	Room's registered to a uniform officer, Manny Senteno.
199	00:13:36	00:13:37	One of ours?
200	00:13:37	00:13:42	Laughlin PD, but he carries tin, so that makes him family.
201	00:13:49	00:13:52	Female vic's Patricia Fielding.
202	00:13:52	00:13:56	Also PD. Bakersfield.
203	00:14:05	00:14:07	He check in alone?
204	00:14:07	00:14:09	Yeah, day before yesterday.
205	00:14:09	00:14:12	Issued one key, but his itemized bill shows lots of room service for two.
206	00:14:12	00:14:17	A wife or girlfriend would probably be on the register.
207	00:14:29	00:14:31	Looks like it's all his stuff.
208	00:14:31	00:14:33	I don't see a purse around here.
209	00:14:33	00:14:38	Guy's away from home, unwinds with some opportunity sex...
210	00:14:39	00:14:41	Looks like he came before he went.
211	00:14:44	00:14:47	Glock 19, standard police issue.
212	00:14:49	00:14:52	There's something on the slide.
213	00:15:05	00:15:06	14 rounds left.
214	00:15:06	00:15:08	15-round magazine.
215	00:15:08	00:15:10	Any good cop keeps one racked in the chamber.
216	00:15:10	00:15:12	Two bullets, two bodies.
217	00:15:12	00:15:13	Put it down!
218	00:15:13	00:15:14	You dare me?!
219	00:15:14	00:15:15	Put it down!
220	00:15:18	00:15:21	I'm thinking straight-up murder/suicide.
221	00:15:26	00:15:28	Tim Coleman's gym bag.
222	00:15:28	00:15:32	Gym clothes, towel, vitamins, pocket knife.
223	00:15:34	00:15:38	Protein bar wrapper, empty water bottle, banana peel.
224	00:15:38	00:15:39	Why the trash?
225	00:15:39	00:15:42	Well, you know, there's a five-minute penalty if you litter the race course.
226	00:15:42	00:15:43	Oh.
227	00:15:43	00:15:46	What's the best way to get chemicals into your system?
228	00:15:46	00:15:48	Injection.
229	00:15:48	00:15:50	But there was no evidence of that. Second best?
230	00:15:50	00:15:51	Ingestion.
231	00:17:03	00:17:07	Trace amounts of furosemide in his water bottle.
232	00:17:07	00:17:09	Someone spiked his drink.
233	00:17:53	00:17:56	Will Marshall, this is Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab. Hi.
234	00:17:56	00:18:01	There is something very wrong in the world if a woman like you is only handling test tubes.
235	00:18:01	00:18:04	Well, if you think that's all I handle, you're not as smart as you think.
236	00:18:04	00:18:08	So, you're the L.A. County team medic, right?
237	00:18:08	00:18:12	That means you're responsible for making sure that all your teammates are well hydrated.
238	00:18:12	00:18:15	Yeah. Including Tim Coleman.
239	00:18:16	00:18:18	Yeah. Hell of a thing, that.
240	00:18:18	00:18:21	You're currently #1 on the SES's transfer list.
241	00:18:21	00:18:26	Same spot you were two months ago when they bypassed you to transfer in Tim Coleman, right?
242	00:18:26	00:18:28	Six months I'm on the top of the list.
243	00:18:28	00:18:32	January 31 comes, and they reach over me and take Coleman.
244	00:18:32	00:18:34	That's the cutoff date to run in the race.
245	00:18:34	00:18:36	Coleman was a ringer.
246	00:18:36	00:18:37	Ding-ding.
247	00:18:37	00:18:39	SES transferred him in for speed, not skill.
248	00:18:39	00:18:41	Might not be another opening for years.
249	00:18:41	00:18:43	I'm not getting any younger.
250	00:18:43	00:18:47	And after all of that, Coleman doesn't even run.
251	00:18:47	00:18:49	He had a good excuse.
252	00:18:49	00:18:51	Did you give it to him?
253	00:18:51	00:18:55	If I'm going to kill a guy, I'm not going to do it with 20,000 cops around.
254	00:18:56	00:18:57	Well...
255	00:18:57	00:19:00	sounds like you've been giving it some serious thought.
256	00:19:00	00:19:01	Well, every cop does.
257	00:19:01	00:19:03	My way?
258	00:19:03	00:19:06	A sniper shot... 200 meters out.
259	00:19:06	00:19:09	Coleman'd never even hear the am in blam.
260	00:19:35	00:19:37	Okay?
261	00:19:46	00:19:50	Mrs. Senteno, is this your husband?
262	00:19:50	00:19:53	He doesn't wear his hair like that.
263	00:19:55	00:19:59	There's some forms for you to sign, then we can talk in the lounge.
264	00:19:59	00:20:01	What happened?
265	00:20:01	00:20:06	Mrs. Senteno, we haven't finished our investigation yet, but your husband died from a gunshot wound.
266	00:20:06	00:20:07	Who shot him?
267	00:20:07	00:20:09	We don't know.
268	00:20:09	00:20:11	Where was he found?
269	00:20:12	00:20:14	In his hotel room.
270	00:20:21	00:20:24	He wasn't alone, was he?
271	00:20:25	00:20:27	No.
272	00:20:27	00:20:29	I married a cop.
273	00:20:29	00:20:33	With that comes alcohol and women to take the edge off.
274	00:20:33	00:20:38	First time... he said it meant nothing.
275	00:20:38	00:20:41	He promised never to do it again.
276	00:20:41	00:20:46	By the third time... I told him to stop confessing.
277	00:20:46	00:20:49	I wasn't going anywhere.
278	00:20:50	00:20:52	Don't ask, don't tell.
279	00:20:52	00:20:57	I wasn't willing to trade my family for the flavor of the month.
280	00:20:57	00:21:00	That doesn't make me pathetic.
281	00:21:07	00:21:09	What happened?
282	00:21:09	00:21:10	Break the bad news to the wife?
283	00:21:10	00:21:11	Oh, I didn't have to.
284	00:21:11	00:21:13	Women always know, huh?
285	00:21:13	00:21:15	Not always. I think so.
286	00:21:16	00:21:17	Women always know when the man is straying.
287	00:21:17	00:21:19	What are you, the voice of experience?
288	00:21:19	00:21:21	No. I'm a really nice guy.
289	00:21:21	00:21:23	Oh, I believe you.
290	00:21:23	00:21:24	Well, you need to believe this.
291	00:21:24	00:21:26	There was one bullet in each of the bodies.
292	00:21:26	00:21:28	They both came from the Glock.
293	00:21:28	00:21:34	And the prints on the Glock are from a female, so it's still looking like a murder/suicide.
294	00:21:34	00:21:36	All right.
295	00:21:36	00:21:38	Hey. You anywhere on my fibers?
296	00:21:38	00:21:41	I'm dealing with a lot of things today.
297	00:21:41	00:21:45	My phone has been ringing off the hook.
298	00:21:45	00:21:49	CSI is taking a ton of crap because we didn't finish the race. There was a dead cop in the desert.
299	00:21:49	00:21:52	That's what I kept telling them, and they tell me, Good excuse.
300	00:21:54	00:22:01	The white fibers found on the gun slide the common nose-picking variety with gun oil residue.
301	00:22:02	00:22:05	Are you saying that the gun was wiped down and the prints were planted?
302	00:22:08	00:22:10	No, you're saying that.
303	00:22:10	00:22:11	I don't get to say that.
304	00:22:11	00:22:15	But somebody else could've pulled the trigger.
305	00:22:19	00:22:25	Manny Sentero's prints are all over the room, including the champagne bottle and one of the glasses.
306	00:22:25	00:22:26	What about Patricia Fielding's?
307	00:22:26	00:22:28	Hotel room door, inside knob.
308	00:22:28	00:22:29	And the murder weapon.
309	00:22:29	00:22:31	That's it?
310	00:22:32	00:22:33	Are you sure?
311	00:22:34	00:22:35	I-I'm sorry.
312	00:22:35	00:22:37	It just doesn't make any sense.
313	00:22:37	00:22:39	The sex kits came back negative, and now this.
314	00:22:39	00:22:40	I mean, that room reeked of musk.
315	00:22:40	00:22:43	Well, maybe he swapped fluids with someone else.
316	00:22:43	00:22:45	There was a third set of prints.
317	00:22:45	00:22:46	I ran it through AFIS.
318	00:22:46	00:22:49	Got a hit on a cop.
319	00:22:49	00:22:50	Another one.
320	00:22:50	00:22:52	Lydia Lopez, Bakersfield PD.
321	00:22:52	00:22:55	That's the same division as Patricia Fielding's.
322	00:22:55	00:23:02	Well, according to Histology, Tim Coleman's muscle cells were hyper-hydrated, yet his body was dehydrated.
323	00:23:02	00:23:05	Well, that condition's normally associated with drug abuse.
324	00:23:05	00:23:09	Right. But apart from the furosemide, his tox was negative.
325	00:23:09	00:23:12	So, I took another look at the guy.
326	00:23:13	00:23:15	Buff, cut, aggressive.
327	00:23:16	00:23:18	Made me think steroids.
328	00:23:18	00:23:21	Kind of risky for a cop, considering they're subject to random drug tests.
329	00:23:21	00:23:23	Well, steroids are controlled, but creatine isn't.
330	00:23:24	00:23:27	It's a legal way to bulk up.
331	00:23:28	00:23:31	Tim Coleman was using it.
332	00:23:31	00:23:35	Creatine pulls the potassium from the blood and moves it into the muscles.
333	00:23:38	00:23:40	Dehydrating the body in the process.
334	00:23:40	00:23:46	Exactly. And you add furosemide to it, and you get a severe electrolyte imbalance.
335	00:23:46	00:23:49	Leading to arrhythmia, and consequently cardiac arrest.
336	00:23:55	00:23:58	So, what's our problem?
337	00:23:58	00:23:59	The dose.
338	00:23:59	00:24:04	There wasn't enough furosemide in the water to make that happen.
339	00:24:12	00:24:14	Lydia Lopez-- the girl next door.
340	00:24:16	00:24:18	CSI. Hello.
341	00:24:18	00:24:23	Her division captain wants every professional courtesy extended to her.
342	00:24:35	00:24:37	Interesting.
343	00:24:37	00:24:38	Yeah.
344	00:24:42	00:24:44	Her clothes are still here.
345	00:24:44	00:24:49	But I guess if you offed two people, you're not going to stick around to pack.
346	00:24:53	00:24:54	Adjoining door's open.
347	00:24:54	00:24:56	Maybe they wanted it that way.
348	00:24:56	00:24:58	So, Manny and Lydia were boning.
349	00:24:59	00:25:01	How does Patricia Fielding fit in?
350	00:25:01	00:25:02	I don't know.
351	00:25:02	00:25:04	Isn't the prevailing male fantasy two on one?
352	00:25:06	00:25:09	So, let's say three of them were going at it.
353	00:25:09	00:25:12	How did two out of three end up dead?
354	00:25:12	00:25:17	Well, if Lydia said no, and Manny went for it anyway...
355	00:25:22	00:25:26	Well, someone was pissed.
356	00:25:26	00:25:30	This is, like, a two, $300 La Perla nightie, ripped to shreds.
357	00:25:30	00:25:31	Oh, looks comfortable.
358	00:25:31	00:25:34	It's not designed to stay on that long.
359	00:25:42	00:25:44	This is a man's wedding ring.
360	00:25:48	00:25:49	Yeah.
361	00:25:49	00:25:54	Manny was wearing a ring.
362	00:25:54	00:25:55	Was Lydia Lopez married?
363	00:25:55	00:25:57	I'll ask her.
364	00:25:57	00:25:59	She walked into LVPD ten minutes ago.
365	00:26:00	00:26:05	My CO calls and tells me that Patty Fielding's been murdered, and you're about to broadcast a citywide for my 20.
366	00:26:05	00:26:07	What the hell's going on in this town?
367	00:26:07	00:26:09	That's what we'd like to know.
368	00:26:09	00:26:11	I hope you've got your story straight.
369	00:26:11	00:26:13	Didn't know I needed one.
370	00:26:13	00:26:18	Patricia Fielding was killed in the room adjoining yours.
371	00:26:19	00:26:22	Manny's room?
372	00:26:22	00:26:23	Where's Manny?
373	00:26:23	00:26:26	Manny's on a slab next to Patricia.
374	00:26:35	00:26:38	Look, we know that you and Manny were together.
375	00:26:38	00:26:41	Once a year for seven years running.
376	00:26:41	00:26:43	Desert Relay is our time together.
377	00:26:44	00:26:46	Then we go back to our lives.
378	00:26:46	00:26:47	That's sweet.
379	00:26:47	00:26:50	What was Sergeant Fielding doing in your lover's room?
380	00:26:50	00:26:51	I don't know.
381	00:26:51	00:26:52	You don't know.
382	00:26:52	00:26:55	You know, I heard that Manny Senteno was a real player.
383	00:26:55	00:26:57	Maybe he moved on, and you didn't like that.
384	00:26:57	00:26:58	Who told you that?
385	00:26:58	00:27:00	Manny doesn't mess around.
386	00:27:00	00:27:01	Except with you.
387	00:27:01	00:27:03	Yes.
388	00:27:03	00:27:05	How could you know that if the only part you know is his body?
389	00:27:05	00:27:07	Pedestal's a little high, don't you think?
390	00:27:07	00:27:10	Your best friend, your lover are dead.
391	00:27:10	00:27:12	What do you expect me to think?
392	00:27:12	00:27:13	I don't know what happened.
393	00:27:13	00:27:17	I do know that Manny loves his wife just like I love my husband.
394	00:27:17	00:27:19	It's just an itch we scratched every 12 months.
395	00:27:19	00:27:20	It doesn't mean anything.
396	00:27:20	00:27:22	It meant enough to someone to trash your room.
397	00:27:22	00:27:24	Archie.
398	00:27:24	00:27:26	Archie-- your husband.
399	00:27:26	00:27:27	Mm-hmm.
400	00:27:27	00:27:28	Did he catch the two of you together?
401	00:27:28	00:27:32	No. He wasn't even supposed to be in Vegas.
402	00:27:32	00:27:33	This is my time.
403	00:27:33	00:27:34	I heard he was looking for me.
404	00:27:34	00:27:36	He must've got a key from the front desk.
405	00:27:36	00:27:39	Probably took one look at the room and went ballistic.
406	00:27:39	00:27:41	Did you see what he did to my teddy?
407	00:27:42	00:27:44	That was Archie's gift to me.
408	00:27:44	00:27:51	Hey, most husbands who buy lingerie expect that they're the ones who're going to be enjoying it.
409	00:27:51	00:27:53	I look good in it.
410	00:27:54	00:27:56	Archie didn't do this.
411	00:27:57	00:27:58	He couldn't.
412	00:28:02	00:28:07	The manager says Clyde Grimes 00.
413	00:28:07	00:28:10	That's consistent with bank records.
414	00:28:10	00:28:15	$300 withdraw to Clyde's account 06.
415	00:28:15	00:28:20	But the video shows him 06.
416	00:28:21	00:28:22	Yeah, one hour later.
417	00:28:22	00:28:28	Well, maybe I'm not the only one who gets screwed up by Daylight Savings Time.
418	00:28:28	00:28:31	What if the ATM and the camera were out of synch?
419	00:28:31	00:28:34	How? The camera's part of the ATM.
420	00:28:34	00:28:36	Video is controlled by the branch office.
421	00:28:36	00:28:38	ATM connects to the national network.
422	00:28:38	00:28:39	Separate systems.
423	00:28:39	00:28:41	If the clocks weren't synchronized...
424	00:28:41	00:28:46	Then the guy who used Tim Coleman's card should be on video one hour later.
425	00:28:57	00:29:01	He's, uh, emptying the ATM.
426	00:31:31	00:31:33	Hey, is everybody all right?
427	00:31:33	00:31:35	Hey, you stupid jackass!
428	00:31:35	00:31:36	I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.
429	00:31:36	00:31:37	Yo, yo, where's the fire, my man?
430	00:31:48	00:31:50	Ha!
431	00:31:52	00:31:53	No wonder you were in a hurry.
432	00:31:56	00:32:02	Well, Mr. Drake, I suppose this is one way to make eight years in an injection molding factory pay off.
433	00:32:02	00:32:04	You're certainly good with plastics.
434	00:32:11	00:32:13	It was a good scam.
435	00:32:13	00:32:18	Your reader transmits the card number to you, and the camera records the sucker's PIN number.
436	00:32:20	00:32:21	I should have used better transmitters.
437	00:32:22	00:32:23	I wouldn't have had to stick so close.
438	00:32:23	00:32:28	You raked in over $13,000 off 62 skimmed accounts.
439	00:32:28	00:32:29	That was just the first two days.
440	00:32:30	00:32:31	And I checked the bank records.
441	00:32:31	00:32:34	All of the cards you stole belonged to cops.
442	00:32:34	00:32:37	I know.
443	00:32:37	00:32:39	You know, I'm facing multiple felony counts here.
444	00:32:39	00:32:42	Comprehensive theft, card fraud.
445	00:32:42	00:32:44	I'm going away for years.
446	00:32:44	00:32:46	Everyone here knows that.
447	00:32:46	00:32:51	But when I got booked, they wrote me up for two moving violations.
448	00:32:52	00:32:54	I hate cops.
449	00:32:56	00:32:58	I picked up Lydia Lopez's husband at Cheetah's.
450	00:32:58	00:32:59	He was groping the strippers.
451	00:32:59	00:33:01	Classic drunk-and-disorderly.
452	00:33:01	00:33:04	When I got there, the bouncer was just about to tune him up.
453	00:33:04	00:33:05	For what?
454	00:33:05	00:33:07	Yakking on his suit. ( laughs )
455	00:33:12	00:33:14	Archie Lopez.
456	00:33:18	00:33:19	So what?
457	00:33:19	00:33:24	Your prints were found in your wife's hotel room, including the doorknob to the adjoining room.
458	00:33:24	00:33:26	Yeah.
459	00:33:26	00:33:28	Patricia Fielding was killed in that room.
460	00:33:28	00:33:30	So was Manny Senteno.
461	00:33:30	00:33:32	Hmm. My heart bleeds.
462	00:33:32	00:33:33	Are you still drunk?
463	00:33:34	00:33:38	Yeah, I'm probably still drunk, yeah.
464	00:33:38	00:33:39	Must have been the tequila.
465	00:33:39	00:33:40	I don't drink that much.
466	00:33:40	00:33:42	Well, it takes a lot of drinking to forget a murder.
467	00:33:45	00:33:47	I didn't kill anyone.
468	00:33:47	00:33:50	I wanted to surprise Lydia.
469	00:33:50	00:33:54	Manager gave me a key.
470	00:34:02	00:34:04	And then I left.
471	00:34:04	00:34:05	Where did you go?
472	00:34:05	00:34:07	I went to the hotel bar.
473	00:34:10	00:34:14	That's where I saw Patty.
474	00:34:14	00:34:16	That woman's been to my house.
475	00:34:16	00:34:18	She's eaten my food.
476	00:34:18	00:34:21	She smiled in my face, all the time...
477	00:34:21	00:34:23	All the time knowing that Lydia was banging someone else.
478	00:34:25	00:34:27	So, where did you go then?
479	00:34:29	00:34:31	I went somewhere else.
480	00:34:31	00:34:32	I drank some more.
481	00:34:32	00:34:33	I drank...
482	00:34:33	00:34:34	A lot, I guess. I don't...
483	00:34:34	00:34:36	I don't remember anything.
484	00:34:36	00:34:39	We're going to need your clothes.
485	00:34:46	00:34:48	Tim Coleman drank from this bottle.
486	00:34:48	00:34:50	What does this look like to you?
487	00:35:04	00:35:06	Backwash.
488	00:36:00	00:36:04	You know, I don't appreciate being kept in the dark this long.
489	00:36:04	00:36:08	We don't release details of our investigation until we're sure of our facts.
490	00:36:08	00:36:10	Now we're sure.
491	00:36:10	00:36:14	Tim Coleman died of a drug-induced cardiac arrest.
492	00:36:14	00:36:17	If I'd known he was on drugs, he'd never have gotten into SES.
493	00:36:17	00:36:19	Actually, he was only on one drug.
494	00:36:19	00:36:20	Creatine.
495	00:36:20	00:36:22	You made it plural.
496	00:36:22	00:36:27	You gave him a protein bar that was laced with furosemide.
497	00:36:28	00:36:31	Hey, you got to keep up your strength.
498	00:36:31	00:36:33	Don't make us look bad.
499	00:36:35	00:36:37	The combination of the two drugs is what killed him.
500	00:36:38	00:36:40	I want my union rep.
501	00:36:40	00:36:42	That's your right.
502	00:36:42	00:36:44	We're going to need to see your pocketknife.
503	00:36:44	00:36:45	On the table, please.
504	00:37:04	00:37:06	I said I want my union rep.
505	00:37:06	00:37:08	We're done here.
506	00:37:59	00:38:03	Archie Lopez's clothes are negative for GSR and blood.
507	00:38:03	00:38:05	Ditto on his personal effects.
508	00:38:05	00:38:10	But I know Archie was in Manny's room because he has Manny's luggage tag.
509	00:38:10	00:38:12	Guy wants to find out who was sticking it to his wife.
510	00:38:13	00:38:16	Is there an address and phone number on that?
511	00:38:16	00:38:20	Yeah. What do guys do when they're drunk, and they have a number burning a hole in their pocket?
512	00:38:29	00:38:32	He called this number six times.
513	00:38:36	00:38:38	The last call was 12 minutes.
514	00:38:38	00:38:42	Maybe Archie found someone who can share his pain.
515	00:38:47	00:38:52	It must be very hard to hear that your husband's been cheating on you.
516	00:38:53	00:38:56	We've been through this.
517	00:38:56	00:38:59	I didn't care about Manny's indiscretions.
518	00:38:59	00:39:02	Even when you hear about it from the other woman's husband?
519	00:39:03	00:39:04	Archie Lopez called you.
520	00:39:04	00:39:06	So I talked to him on the phone.
521	00:39:06	00:39:07	He was drunk.
522	00:39:07	00:39:09	He was raving.
523	00:39:09	00:39:11	I didn't understand half of what he said.
524	00:39:11	00:39:13	I think you heard him loud and clear.
525	00:39:13	00:39:15	You got in your car, and you tore ass to Vegas.
526	00:39:15	00:39:17	I was in Laughlin with my son.
527	00:39:17	00:39:21	Highway Patrol caught you speeding on Interstate 15.
528	00:39:21	00:39:22	Southbound.
529	00:39:24	00:39:27	Most cops won't issue tickets to fellow cops or their families.
530	00:39:27	00:39:28	Professional courtesy.
531	00:39:28	00:39:30	But your tag still gets logged.
532	00:39:30	00:39:35	You were leaving Las Vegas before you even found out that your husband was dead.
533	00:39:37	00:39:39	I don't understand what you're talking about.
534	00:39:41	00:39:43	Yeah, you do.
535	00:39:46	00:39:48	Oh, you bastard.
536	00:39:54	00:39:56	You can't prove that.
537	00:39:58	00:40:01	Well, that's why we got a warrant to search your house.
538	00:40:01	00:40:06	And we found Patricia Fielding's blood in the lining of your purse.
539	00:40:06	00:40:10	From the tissue that you used to wipe the gun.
540	00:40:20	00:40:22	She was nothing.
541	00:40:25	00:40:29	He jeopardized our family for that?
542	00:40:30	00:40:32	Not for her.
543	00:40:34	00:40:37	Patricia wasn't the one having the affair with your husband.
544	00:40:37	00:40:38	Oh.
545	00:40:39	00:40:41	I caught her with him.
546	00:40:43	00:40:46	She answered the door like she belonged there.
547	00:40:47	00:40:50	Mrs. Senteno, you killed the wrong woman.
548	00:40:51	00:40:53	Wendy, it's not what you think.
549	00:41:13	00:41:15	Where's your kit?
550	00:41:15	00:41:17	Actually, we have all the evidence we need.
551	00:41:20	00:41:23	Then what the hell are you doing here?
552	00:41:23	00:41:25	I have a question.
553	00:41:25	00:41:28	Off the record.
554	00:41:31	00:41:34	I wasn't trying to kill him.
555	00:41:34	00:41:36	Then why did you do this?
556	00:41:39	00:41:41	Leg 16 was mine.
557	00:41:41	00:41:45	I ran it eight years in a row.
558	00:41:45	00:41:47	I won every time.
559	00:41:48	00:41:53	Then the bosses transfer in that kid, kick me upstairs, and give him my race.
560	00:41:55	00:41:57	No way I was going to let him do better than me.
561	00:42:00	00:42:04	Sooner or later, everybody gets replaced.
562	00:42:04	00:42:08	Talk to me when it happens to you.
