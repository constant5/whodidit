0,00:00:24,00:00:25,Oh...
1,00:00:25,00:00:28,"Honey here, take this."
2,00:00:36,00:00:38,Not again.
3,00:00:38,00:00:39,We are buying that alarm system.
4,00:00:39,00:00:41,No argument from me. I'm serious.
5,00:00:46,00:00:48,They got the cash.
6,00:00:48,00:00:49,Why did they have to make such a mess?
7,00:00:50,00:00:51,"Oh, my God..."
8,00:00:51,00:00:52,What? What's wrong?
9,00:00:52,00:00:54,Call 911.
10,00:01:36,00:01:37,Introductions?
11,00:01:37,00:01:41,"Joseph Felton, 44 not an employee; no reason to be here."
12,00:01:41,00:01:43,Mind if he and I have a moment?
13,00:01:43,00:01:44,No.
14,00:02:19,00:02:20,Burn marks?
15,00:02:20,00:02:23,Unusual way to penetrate a safe.
16,00:02:23,00:02:24,Hmm...
17,00:02:24,00:02:25,How much was taken?
18,00:02:25,00:02:27,"Three hundred and something, small bills."
19,00:02:27,00:02:30,GRISSOM: Multiple contusions to the back of the skull.
20,00:02:30,00:02:32,Might've been taken by surprise.
21,00:02:32,00:02:34,Robbery interruptus?
22,00:02:34,00:02:37,"Yeah, I think our robbery suspect is a homicide victim."
23,00:02:37,00:02:39,One way to beat the rap.
24,00:02:39,00:03:15,[Captioning sponsored by CBS and CBS PRODUCTIONS/ ALLIANCE ATLANTIS] DR. ROBBINS: This is an easy one.
25,00:03:15,00:03:16,Three hits to the head.
26,00:03:16,00:03:18,Trauma to the brain stem was fatal.
27,00:03:18,00:03:20,Death was instantaneous.
28,00:03:20,00:03:22,Can you tell us about the murder weapon?
29,00:03:23,00:03:27,Nothing definitive but I swabbed the points of impact.
30,00:03:27,00:03:29,Slide's under the microscope.
31,00:03:33,00:03:38,STOKES: Yellow looks like transfer from the murder weapon but what's with the glitter?
32,00:03:38,00:03:39,ROBBINS: Unidentified mineral.
33,00:03:39,00:03:42,I sent a sample to Trace for analysis.
34,00:03:42,00:03:44,"Hey, Doc, you have a comb?"
35,00:03:46,00:03:48,"Your hair looks great, Cath."
36,00:03:48,00:03:49,"Gee, thanks, Nick."
37,00:03:49,00:03:51,Guy's still dirty.
38,00:03:51,00:03:53,They don't get a bath till evidence is collected.
39,00:03:53,00:03:56,That's what I'm doing although I don't think this is dirt.
40,00:04:02,00:04:04,He's covered in spores.
41,00:04:09,00:04:11,I think these are from a fern.
42,00:04:11,00:04:14,"Well, the back entrance was overgrown with them."
43,00:04:21,00:04:25,A fern plant deposits billions of spores in its lifetime.
44,00:04:25,00:04:27,Most are just dust in the wind.
45,00:04:27,00:04:29,In our case they're evidence.
46,00:04:29,00:04:35,As good as fingerprints or fibers in placing a suspect at a crime scene.
47,00:04:37,00:04:40,"Hey, you forget about the coroner?"
48,00:04:40,00:04:42,Melissa Marlowe.
49,00:04:42,00:04:44,Excuse me?
50,00:04:44,00:04:46,You lifted 38 prints from the pottery store.
51,00:04:46,00:04:48,I scanned them through AFIS.
52,00:04:48,00:04:49,One came back.
53,00:04:50,00:04:51,Melissa Marlowe.
54,00:04:51,00:04:53,Why do I know that name?
55,00:04:53,00:04:58,"Kidnapping Arizona, 21 years ago..."
56,00:04:58,00:05:00,the little girl.
57,00:05:00,00:05:03,"Oh, that Melissa Marlowe."
58,00:05:03,00:05:05,Wasn't she presumed dead?
59,00:05:05,00:05:07,"Well, not anymore."
60,00:05:07,00:05:12,"On the left is Melissa Marlowe's print, age four-- preschool fingerprinting initiative."
61,00:05:12,00:05:14,On the right is a print that you lifted.
62,00:05:14,00:05:16,I don't see a match.
63,00:05:16,00:05:22,Neither did I but since fingerprints are set for life during the fourth month of fetal development I looked beyond the size differential.
64,00:05:22,00:05:26,"Now, both prints are ulnar loops."
65,00:05:26,00:05:31,"Bifurcation, recurve and ridge endings are identical."
66,00:05:32,00:05:34,I've aligned the prints along the delta.
67,00:05:38,00:05:41,WILLOWS: You've got a perfect match.
68,00:05:41,00:05:46,Wait... is she a suspect in the homicide?
69,00:05:46,00:05:48,"No, her print wasn't fresh."
70,00:05:48,00:05:49,There was dust on it.
71,00:05:49,00:05:51,Has to be a few weeks old.
72,00:05:51,00:05:53,I think we have two separate cases.
73,00:05:53,00:05:57,So I'm going to take the new lead in the old kidnapping case.
74,00:05:57,00:05:59,Nick and I will cover the homicide.
75,00:06:07,00:06:12,SIDLE: Nadine Winston falls asleep in that chair and incinerates.
76,00:06:12,00:06:13,We could make history.
77,00:06:13,00:06:15,"Come on, now. Don't tell me you believe in that BS."
78,00:06:15,00:06:17,"No, of course not."
79,00:06:18,00:06:21,I'm a scientist. I just...
80,00:06:21,00:06:23,She has been reduced to ashes.
81,00:06:27,00:06:30,Spontaneous human combustion is science fiction.
82,00:06:30,00:06:31,I know.
83,00:06:31,00:06:33,There's no such thing as a human torch.
84,00:06:35,00:06:38,What if it is real and we've uncovered it?
85,00:06:38,00:06:39,"Sara, this is a crime scene."
86,00:06:39,00:06:41,"Stay with me here, okay?"
87,00:06:41,00:06:43,Don't lose it.
88,00:06:43,00:06:45,I'm not.
89,00:06:45,00:06:48,I'm just open to all theories.
90,00:06:49,00:06:50,What's that?
91,00:06:52,00:06:57,Looks like cotton fiber... possibly from a nightgown.
92,00:06:57,00:07:00,It's barely scorched.
93,00:07:00,00:07:02,Weird.
94,00:07:02,00:07:05,"It's like the body burned, but..."
95,00:07:06,00:07:09,the clothing was fire retardant.
96,00:07:13,00:07:15,BROWN: Wow.
97,00:07:15,00:07:16,Check that out.
98,00:07:20,00:07:25,Fire practically burned a hole in the roof but it's isolated in one spot.
99,00:07:25,00:07:28,It's like the fire created a chimney for itself.
100,00:07:28,00:07:30,The victim she live alone?
101,00:07:30,00:07:32,Husband's already at the station.
102,00:07:32,00:07:37,"Look, I am telling you, I have no idea what happened to my wife."
103,00:07:37,00:07:39,Were you having marital problems?
104,00:07:39,00:07:41,No.
105,00:07:41,00:07:45,We were like newlyweds.
106,00:07:45,00:07:49,INVESTIGATOR: If I understand you correctly you went to bed.
107,00:07:49,00:07:53,Nadine fell asleep in the easy chair.
108,00:07:53,00:07:58,"Ten hours later you woke up, walked into the living room and she was a pile of ash."
109,00:07:58,00:08:00,A human torch.
110,00:08:00,00:08:01,"Yeah, right."
111,00:08:01,00:08:04,You say you were like newlyweds?
112,00:08:04,00:08:05,Yeah.
113,00:08:06,00:08:08,But the two of you weren't sleeping in the same bed.
114,00:08:08,00:08:09,Good question.
115,00:08:12,00:08:13,She snored.
116,00:08:13,00:08:14,It was a problem.
117,00:08:17,00:08:19,A small one.
118,00:08:19,00:08:23,Mr. Winston...
119,00:08:23,00:08:25,do you know how to use a blowtorch?
120,00:08:25,00:08:27,Another good question.
121,00:08:27,00:08:29,"Look, I came down to this station on my own."
122,00:08:29,00:08:32,"If I can be helpful, let me know!"
123,00:08:35,00:08:37,(door slamming)
124,00:08:37,00:08:40,So you still think it's spontaneous combustion?
125,00:08:40,00:08:43,Theories give way to conclusions once all the evidence is in.
126,00:08:43,00:08:46,I am merely thinking about the next piece of evidence.
127,00:08:46,00:08:48,Yeah.
128,00:08:48,00:08:51,"Hey, Nicky, you paged me?"
129,00:08:51,00:08:53,"Yeah. Yeah, Jim, hi."
130,00:08:53,00:08:56,I took these photos at the crime scene.
131,00:08:56,00:08:59,Safe was cracked with a plasma lance.
132,00:08:59,00:09:01,"Okay, I'll bite."
133,00:09:01,00:09:03,It's a high-powered electric blaster.
134,00:09:03,00:09:06,It could cut through that hard plate with extreme precision.
135,00:09:06,00:09:08,"It's not common, but effective."
136,00:09:08,00:09:10,Crime scene photo from a robbery case in '99.
137,00:09:10,00:09:23,"Joseph Felton our dead guy, was arrested but granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against his partner, Darin Hanson who used a plasma lance to crack that safe."
138,00:09:23,00:09:28,Darin Hanson was released from prison last month.
139,00:09:28,00:09:33,"Last known address, Vegas I see where you're going."
140,00:09:33,00:09:36,"So Hanson gets out of jail, hooks up with our dead guy."
141,00:09:36,00:09:37,"Yeah, they hook it up..."
142,00:09:37,00:09:44,break through the rear entrance of the pottery store Hanson lances the safe...
143,00:09:46,00:09:50,"Once the safe is cracked, Hanson steps back allowing Felton to collect the cash."
144,00:09:50,00:09:54,With Felton's attention diverted Hanson seizes the moment...
145,00:09:56,00:09:57,And kills him.
146,00:09:57,00:10:00,Revenge for testifying against him and putting him in prison.
147,00:10:01,00:10:02,That's not bad.
148,00:10:03,00:10:05,Any chance you found the murder weapon?
149,00:10:05,00:10:08,"No, no... but I think we know who to ask."
150,00:10:08,00:10:11,I haven't seen Joseph Felton since the trial two years ago.
151,00:10:12,00:10:15,So it's a coincidence he was killed shortly after you were released from prison.
152,00:10:15,00:10:16,Yeah. Guy put me in jail.
153,00:10:16,00:10:18,I had no reason to see him again.
154,00:10:18,00:10:20,"He put you in the ""Gray Bar""?"
155,00:10:20,00:10:21,Sounds like motive to me.
156,00:10:21,00:10:24,"BRASS: Darin you and Felton, you go back, huh?"
157,00:10:25,00:10:26,Mm-hmm.
158,00:10:26,00:10:28,Knew the guy 15 years.
159,00:10:28,00:10:30,My folks lived across the street from him.
160,00:10:31,00:10:32,We'd barbecue with his wife and daughter.
161,00:10:32,00:10:35,Then it must've really pissed you off when he turned on you.
162,00:10:35,00:10:43,"STOKES: The transcript from your trial says that you used a plasma lance in that '99 burglary, and there it is again, Darin."
163,00:10:43,00:10:44,Joe was the lance guy.
164,00:10:44,00:10:47,He taught me how to break into safes.
165,00:10:47,00:10:48,That's why the MO's the same.
166,00:10:48,00:10:52,BRASS: Where were you this morning early a.m.?
167,00:10:52,00:10:55,I was in Barstow all week.
168,00:10:55,00:10:57,Just got back this afternoon.
169,00:10:57,00:10:59,Okay...
170,00:10:59,00:11:01,here you go...
171,00:11:01,00:11:03,receipts from the trip.
172,00:11:03,00:11:04,Go ahead.
173,00:11:08,00:11:10,WILLOWS: Looks authentic.
174,00:11:10,00:11:14,"Cactus Pine Cafe, Barstow, noon today."
175,00:11:19,00:11:21,We can't hold him.
176,00:11:24,00:11:29,"WOMAN: 21 years ago, the chief of police sat in our living room and told us our daughter was dead."
177,00:11:29,00:11:30,"After all this time, She's in Vegas?"
178,00:11:30,00:11:32,That's a hundred miles from our home.
179,00:11:32,00:11:34,"Well, we still don't know where she is."
180,00:11:34,00:11:41,"Her prints in the pottery store tell us that shewashere possibly a few weeks ago, but Vegas is a tourist town."
181,00:11:41,00:11:43,But you know she's alive.
182,00:11:43,00:11:45,I'm still not sure we can find her.
183,00:11:45,00:11:47,She's our only child.
184,00:11:47,00:11:49,We never gave up hope.
185,00:11:49,00:11:50,We're not giving up now.
186,00:11:50,00:11:51,MILLER: Excuse me.
187,00:11:51,00:11:53,Teri...
188,00:11:53,00:11:54,come in.
189,00:11:54,00:11:55,Hi.
190,00:11:56,00:11:57,"Teri Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe."
191,00:11:57,00:11:58,Hello.
192,00:11:58,00:11:59,Hi.
193,00:11:59,00:12:01,GRISSOM: Teri is a forensic artist.
194,00:12:01,00:12:02,I called her to help us.
195,00:12:02,00:12:04,Did you bring the photographs of Melissa?
196,00:12:04,00:12:07,"Yes, but I don't see how they can help."
197,00:12:07,00:12:09,"In some of those, she's just an infant."
198,00:12:09,00:12:10,It doesn't matter.
199,00:12:10,00:12:11,Do you remember her eyes?
200,00:12:12,00:12:14,I could never forget.
201,00:12:14,00:12:15,"As we age, our eyes don't change."
202,00:12:15,00:12:16,That's where we'll start.
203,00:12:16,00:12:24,Using computer software Teri can age Melissa's picture so that we can determine what she looks like today at age 25.
204,00:12:24,00:12:27,Then we send it off to every law enforcement agency in the state.
205,00:12:27,00:12:28,It's been so long.
206,00:12:28,00:12:30,Tell us the truth.
207,00:12:30,00:12:31,What are our chances?
208,00:12:31,00:12:36,"Well, 21 years ago, they told you that your daughter was dead."
209,00:12:36,00:12:39,Now we're moving in the right direction.
210,00:12:50,00:12:53,Where did you find him?
211,00:12:53,00:12:58,At a pottery store on Stansberry Street.
212,00:12:59,00:13:01,"Tammy, we've already ID'd your father."
213,00:13:01,00:13:03,"If you don't want to see him, I'd understand."
214,00:13:03,00:13:06,"No, I want to say good-bye."
215,00:13:06,00:13:10,"Well, don't be surprised by some swelling and discoloration."
216,00:13:31,00:13:33,You have any other family?
217,00:13:33,00:13:34,No.
218,00:13:38,00:13:42,I can put you in touch with a counselor if you need to talk.
219,00:13:42,00:13:44,"No, thank you."
220,00:13:50,00:13:51,If there's anything you need...
221,00:14:11,00:14:13,Tammy...
222,00:14:13,00:14:16,were you at the pottery store with your father?
223,00:14:18,00:14:19,What are you talking about?
224,00:14:22,00:14:24,WILLOWS: There's some plant spores on your sweater.
225,00:14:26,00:14:31,"We found them on your father, too and matched them to some ferns behind the pottery store."
226,00:14:31,00:14:33,I don't understand.
227,00:14:34,00:14:37,What are you doing?
228,00:14:37,00:14:38,I'm taking these spores into evidence.
229,00:14:38,00:14:43,They place you at the crime scene.
230,00:14:45,00:14:47,Is there anything you want to tell me?
231,00:14:51,00:14:54,"Okay, I was there."
232,00:14:55,00:14:56,Dad!
233,00:14:57,00:14:58,"Dad, don't do this."
234,00:14:58,00:14:59,I'll get a job.
235,00:14:59,00:15:01,We don't need the money.
236,00:15:01,00:15:03,"Tammy, go home."
237,00:15:07,00:15:09,And I don't know what happened after that.
238,00:15:09,00:15:12,Why didn't you just tell me that?
239,00:15:12,00:15:19,I wanted to preserve the good memories not remember my dad as a thief.
240,00:15:19,00:15:22,I didn't kill him; I loved him.
241,00:15:24,00:15:28,I need a release from your office...
242,00:15:28,00:15:30,so I can bury my father.
243,00:15:36,00:15:38,Tell me everything you can about this foot.
244,00:15:39,00:15:40,Where's the rest of the body?
245,00:15:40,00:15:41,Incinerated.
246,00:15:41,00:15:43,Lab results from the ashes came back.
247,00:15:43,00:15:44,Negative for accelerant.
248,00:15:44,00:15:46,Nothing flammable but sebaceous glutamate.
249,00:15:46,00:15:48,Human fat.
250,00:15:48,00:15:49,Well...
251,00:15:49,00:15:53,I can tell you that the malleolus-- the ankle bone-- is completely hollowed out.
252,00:15:53,00:15:56,Bone marrow was reduced to ash.
253,00:15:56,00:15:59,"Which means that the foot was burned off the body, not severed."
254,00:16:00,00:16:03,That's consistent with your theory of spontaneous combustion.
255,00:16:03,00:16:04,How do you know about Sara's theory?
256,00:16:04,00:16:06,Word gets around.
257,00:16:06,00:16:08,You're siding with Sara 'cause you got a crush on her.
258,00:16:08,00:16:10,"No, that's why I wore a clean coat."
259,00:16:10,00:16:12,I'm just reporting my observations.
260,00:16:12,00:16:15,"If the foot had been severed, the marrow would still be intact."
261,00:16:15,00:16:19,"So your official ""observation"" is spontaneous combustion?"
262,00:16:19,00:16:20,Not yet.
263,00:16:20,00:16:23,I want to send a scraping down to toxicology.
264,00:16:24,00:16:26,Excuse me.
265,00:16:26,00:16:31,I want to check for any flammable compounds in the blood but don't expect much.
266,00:16:31,00:16:36,The quality of the sample may have been compromised by the heat.
267,00:16:37,00:16:39,I'm going to go talk to Grissom see what he thinks.
268,00:16:39,00:16:41,"No, no, we're a team."
269,00:16:41,00:16:44,The only place we're going is back down to that crime scene.
270,00:16:44,00:16:46,"Okay, software's loaded."
271,00:16:47,00:16:49,It's preprogrammed with developmental averages?
272,00:16:49,00:16:50,Exactly.
273,00:16:51,00:16:54,Aging is about predictable craniofacial growth.
274,00:16:54,00:16:55,Faces grow down and out.
275,00:16:55,00:16:58,So the first step is to stretch the bottom half of the face.
276,00:17:01,00:17:02,You try.
277,00:17:02,00:17:04,Go ahead.
278,00:17:10,00:17:11,Well!
279,00:17:13,00:17:14,Maybe you should drive.
280,00:17:14,00:17:15,Good idea.
281,00:17:16,00:17:18,Here we go.
282,00:17:18,00:17:26,"So at age four, the bridge of the nose is taking shape and the interorbital distance is established and baby teeth are visible."
283,00:17:26,00:17:28,I have a question.
284,00:17:28,00:17:29,Okay.
285,00:17:29,00:17:34,Since I screwed up our last date will we ever have dinner again?
286,00:17:34,00:17:35,"Oh, we'll have dinner..."
287,00:17:35,00:17:38,just not together.
288,00:17:38,00:17:42,So the ears are low and large in proportion to the head.
289,00:17:42,00:17:44,"You know, I did apologize."
290,00:17:44,00:17:47,And you're forgiven.
291,00:17:47,00:17:58,"So over the next ten years, the face elongates the skin thickens, the hair pattern is set and the small deciduous teeth are replaced by the secondary dentition."
292,00:17:58,00:18:04,Once the face is aged I look to the mother to fill in the blanks.
293,00:18:06,00:18:07,Is that Mrs. Marlowe?
294,00:18:07,00:18:08,Uh-huh.
295,00:18:08,00:18:13,Most daughters at age 25 age quite similar to their mothers.
296,00:18:17,00:18:22,A network of grids allows me to fine-tune the tiniest facial characteristics one section at a time.
297,00:18:22,00:18:28,"I'm just softening a few edges, growing the hair..."
298,00:18:29,00:18:32,and we're done.
299,00:18:32,00:18:34,Well...
300,00:18:34,00:18:35,"hello, Melissa."
301,00:18:35,00:18:37,Am I interrupting?
302,00:18:37,00:18:38,Not at all.
303,00:18:38,00:18:39,You're just in time.
304,00:18:40,00:18:43,"GRISSOM: Catherine, say hello to Melissa Marlowe."
305,00:18:46,00:18:48,"Oh, my God."
306,00:18:48,00:18:50,What?
307,00:18:50,00:18:55,That's Tammy Felton and we've already met.
308,00:18:58,00:19:01,Tammy Felton's our murder suspect?
309,00:19:01,00:19:08,She was kidnapped 21 year ago and may have killed the man who raised her-- possibly the same man who kidnapped her.
310,00:19:08,00:19:12,"Whoa, wait. I thought her prints from the crime scene-- they weren't fresh."
311,00:19:12,00:19:17,"Yeah, well, she could've cased the place weeks ago and then remembered to wear gloves on the big night."
312,00:19:17,00:19:19,So what's the word on the murder weapon?
313,00:19:19,00:19:21,"Well, the swab from the head wound's at Trace."
314,00:19:21,00:19:22,And?
315,00:19:22,00:19:23,I'm on it.
316,00:19:23,00:19:27,You and I have an appointment with our shrink.
317,00:19:27,00:19:29,"Here-- you twirl, I'll talk."
318,00:19:29,00:19:31,My son has Little League in an hour.
319,00:19:31,00:19:34,He's scared of the ball.
320,00:19:34,00:19:36,You think this new bat's going to do the trick?
321,00:19:36,00:19:37,(chuckling)
322,00:19:37,00:19:39,Why don't you just talk with him?
323,00:19:43,00:19:45,"Dr. Kane, this girl was kidnapped at age four."
324,00:19:46,00:19:48,Would she have any recollection of her prior life?
325,00:19:48,00:20:01,The theory of infantile amnesia suggests that we have no cognitive memory before the age of three but since Tammy-- or Melissa-- was taken from her biological parents at age four she may remember something of her former life.
326,00:20:01,00:20:05,But these memories would be... tenuous?
327,00:20:05,00:20:11,A sound or a smell might awaken some latent image or feeling but she'd have difficulty contextualizing these sensations.
328,00:20:11,00:20:14,That's got to be frustrating.
329,00:20:14,00:20:21,And it's precisely that frustration which dominates this woman's present state of mind.
330,00:20:21,00:20:27,Kidnapped children at that age tend to exhibit some degree of sociopathy as adults.
331,00:20:27,00:20:28,Such as?
332,00:20:28,00:20:32,"Inability to feel guilt, compassion or love, right?"
333,00:20:32,00:20:36,"Correct, but the most defining characteristic is their instinct for survival."
334,00:20:36,00:20:39,There's nothing that they won't do.
335,00:20:39,00:20:41,Tammy Felton needs help.
336,00:20:41,00:20:45,"She may be a suspect, but she's also a victim."
337,00:20:45,00:20:46,"Cath, meet with her again."
338,00:20:46,00:20:48,Ask open questions.
339,00:20:50,00:20:52,"Thanks for your insights, Philip."
340,00:20:52,00:20:54,I'll let you know how this unfolds.
341,00:20:54,00:20:57,Gil... be careful.
342,00:20:57,00:21:04,Sociopaths are dangerous because they don't function by the same... moral code as the rest of us.
343,00:21:04,00:21:08,Welcome tomyworld.
344,00:21:08,00:21:09,I checked with Homicide again.
345,00:21:09,00:21:11,They found no evidence of foul play.
346,00:21:11,00:21:13,What about the husband-- is he still a suspect?
347,00:21:13,00:21:14,No motive.
348,00:21:14,00:21:16,O'Riley spoke with friends and relatives.
349,00:21:16,00:21:17,They were a loving couple.
350,00:21:17,00:21:21,"What about, uh... life insurance policies?"
351,00:21:21,00:21:23,"No, and you're reaching."
352,00:21:23,00:21:24,I'm not the one who's reaching here.
353,00:21:24,00:21:26,"We're scientists, right?"
354,00:21:26,00:21:29,"We want answers, the satisfaction of certainty."
355,00:21:29,00:21:32,I'm not ignoring scientific method.
356,00:21:32,00:21:34,I'm just keeping an open mind.
357,00:21:34,00:21:39,If we eliminate all the alternatives we're left with spontaneous combustion.
358,00:21:39,00:21:41,That's exciting!
359,00:21:41,00:21:45,"That would be cool, but you've been jumping to that conclusion from minute one."
360,00:21:45,00:21:46,She's a pile of ash.
361,00:21:46,00:21:48,"Well, I brought the ion detector."
362,00:21:48,00:21:52,This will pick up even the smallest traces of hydrocarbon fumes.
363,00:21:52,00:21:54,I don't care what the lab says.
364,00:21:54,00:22:00,This puppy will reveal exactly what accelerant was used to start the fire.
365,00:22:00,00:22:02,(clicking)
366,00:22:10,00:22:12,(clicking continues)
367,00:22:12,00:22:13,Well?
368,00:22:14,00:22:16,(clicking stops)
369,00:22:16,00:22:17,Nothing.
370,00:22:19,00:22:21,You know I love you.
371,00:22:21,00:22:25,"Yes... no, I loveyoumore."
372,00:22:25,00:22:26,"No, I love you more."
373,00:22:26,00:22:28,(clears throat)
374,00:22:31,00:22:33,"Bye, baby."
375,00:22:33,00:22:36,Do you have the results on the swab yet?
376,00:22:36,00:22:37,Uh...
377,00:22:38,00:22:40,Uh... from the dead guy at the pottery store?
378,00:22:40,00:22:41,The coroner sent over a sample.
379,00:22:41,00:22:45,You were supposed to analyze the mineral content.
380,00:22:45,00:22:46,"Oh, yeah, I'm sorry."
381,00:22:46,00:22:49,Grissom has just been running me around like a lapdog.
382,00:22:49,00:22:51,I haven't had a chance.
383,00:22:51,00:22:53,Grissom's on a missing persons-- he hasn't sent you anything.
384,00:22:53,00:22:56,Did I say Grissom?
385,00:22:56,00:22:57,"No, I meant Catherine."
386,00:22:57,00:22:59,"Oh, yeah. Catherine's working with me."
387,00:22:59,00:23:01,Oh.
388,00:23:01,00:23:03,"Well, what do you say we check out that swab then, huh?"
389,00:23:03,00:23:05,Great.
390,00:23:05,00:23:08,(laughing)
391,00:23:08,00:23:10,"Don't you ever goof off, huh?"
392,00:23:11,00:23:13,Do you ever get a little lost in life?
393,00:23:13,00:23:15,No.
394,00:23:15,00:23:17,"Well, you should."
395,00:23:23,00:23:26,STOKES: Do you see the sparkling bits?
396,00:23:26,00:23:28,Fluorescent minerals.
397,00:23:28,00:23:29,Interesting.
398,00:23:29,00:23:32,"Here, do me a favor, will you?"
399,00:23:32,00:23:34,Put your nose down the scope.
400,00:23:34,00:23:38,When you see the sparkling bits glow give a shout.
401,00:23:50,00:23:52,"Okay, ready?"
402,00:23:52,00:23:54,"Yeah, ready."
403,00:23:59,00:24:00,Lead.
404,00:24:00,00:24:03,Zinc.
405,00:24:06,00:24:08,Lithium.
406,00:24:08,00:24:09,Anything?
407,00:24:09,00:24:10,Nothing yet.
408,00:24:11,00:24:14,Manganese.
409,00:24:17,00:24:19,Petroleum.
410,00:24:22,00:24:23,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
411,00:24:23,00:24:24,Stop.
412,00:24:26,00:24:28,It's uranium.
413,00:24:28,00:24:29,Are you serious?
414,00:24:29,00:24:32,Simple quantum mechanics.
415,00:24:32,00:24:40,"When the molecule is bombarded with energy at a specific level the electrons excite, causing the mineral to glow and at this wavelength, it's definitely uranium."
416,00:24:40,00:24:41,Which is radioactive.
417,00:24:42,00:24:44,Do we need to evacuate the building or anything?
418,00:24:44,00:24:47,The amount is trace.
419,00:24:47,00:24:48,We should be fine.
420,00:24:48,00:24:49,Are you sure?
421,00:24:49,00:24:50,No.
422,00:24:52,00:24:58,But I can tell you one thing for sure-- there is definitely uranium on your murder weapon.
423,00:25:00,00:25:06,"I hear that, uh Greg found uranium on the swab from Felton's skull."
424,00:25:06,00:25:09,"Yeah. He says I'm okay, but you know Greg."
425,00:25:09,00:25:12,"Tell me, am I radiating a green glow?"
426,00:25:13,00:25:15,"You'll be fine, Silkwood."
427,00:25:15,00:25:17,"What's uranium doing on a murder weapon, anyway?"
428,00:25:17,00:25:26,"Well, before Peter Parker was bit by that radioactive spider and became Spider-Man back in the '50s oxidized uranium flecks were used as color enhancers."
429,00:25:26,00:25:27,Color enhancers?
430,00:25:27,00:25:29,Like paint?
431,00:25:29,00:25:31,"Paints, dyes, glazes..."
432,00:25:31,00:25:35,Since our guy was killed in a pottery store...
433,00:25:35,00:25:37,Say no more.
434,00:25:59,00:26:01,(clicking)
435,00:26:17,00:26:20,You got to be kidding me.
436,00:26:21,00:26:22,You found Melissa?
437,00:26:22,00:26:23,Yes.
438,00:26:23,00:26:25,When can we see her?
439,00:26:25,00:26:28,It's not quite that simple.
440,00:26:28,00:26:29,What do you mean?
441,00:26:29,00:26:31,"Well, I don't want to be evasive."
442,00:26:31,00:26:33,"It's just that, uh..."
443,00:26:33,00:26:36,we suspect she might've committed a crime.
444,00:26:36,00:26:38,What kind of crime?
445,00:26:38,00:26:41,A homicide.
446,00:26:41,00:26:42,This can't be happening.
447,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Mr. Grissom, we want to see our daughter-- now."
448,00:26:48,00:26:50,Tell me about your mother.
449,00:26:50,00:26:53,What's she got to do with this?
450,00:26:53,00:27:03,"Tammy, if you've got nothing to hide and you want me to find out who killed your father why don't you just answer my questions?"
451,00:27:03,00:27:05,"Mara, my mother..."
452,00:27:05,00:27:07,died a few years ago.
453,00:27:07,00:27:14,"I can let you see her, but I can't allow you to talk to her not right now and not under these circumstances."
454,00:27:21,00:27:24,WILLOWS: Do you have any siblings?
455,00:27:24,00:27:27,Only child.
456,00:27:27,00:27:29,How was your childhood?
457,00:27:29,00:27:31,Were you a happy child?
458,00:27:31,00:27:33,Did you have any friends?
459,00:27:33,00:27:36,"Look, I don't see how these questions are going to help you."
460,00:27:36,00:27:38,May I go?
461,00:27:38,00:27:41,Sure.
462,00:27:48,00:27:49,(door slams)
463,00:27:51,00:27:53,Melissa!
464,00:27:53,00:27:55,Melissa...
465,00:27:55,00:27:56,Excuse me?
466,00:27:56,00:27:57,It's mom...
467,00:27:57,00:27:59,Baby...
468,00:27:59,00:28:01,Lady...
469,00:28:02,00:28:04,I'm not your daughter.
470,00:28:09,00:28:12,Who is she?
471,00:28:12,00:28:14,Her name? Who is she now?
472,00:28:15,00:28:17,Tammy-- Tammy Felton.
473,00:28:17,00:28:19,"Oh, my God."
474,00:28:19,00:28:20,What?
475,00:28:20,00:28:22,Mara Felton was our baby-sitter.
476,00:28:22,00:28:26,The police questioned Mara when Melissa disappeared.
477,00:28:26,00:28:29,"Tammy referred to her mother as Mara, now deceased."
478,00:28:29,00:28:31,I am her mother.
479,00:28:31,00:28:33,Of course. I didn't mean...
480,00:28:33,00:28:35,We need a lawyer.
481,00:28:35,00:28:36,Why would you need a lawyer?
482,00:28:37,00:28:39,Not for us; for our daughter.
483,00:28:46,00:28:47,What were you thinking?
484,00:28:47,00:28:49,I don't know.
485,00:28:49,00:28:53,"I wanted to observe them, I guess."
486,00:28:53,00:28:56,That woman hasn't seen her daughter in 21 years.
487,00:28:56,00:28:59,You actually thought a glass wall would keep them apart?
488,00:28:59,00:29:01,I never thought about that.
489,00:29:01,00:29:02,I know.
490,00:29:02,00:29:05,You're not good with people.
491,00:29:05,00:29:06,Yeah.
492,00:29:08,00:29:11,Interesting voice mail you left me.
493,00:29:11,00:29:13,What's that?
494,00:29:13,00:29:19,"""Meet me behind CSI and bring a cotton nightgown."" I'd wear it for you but, uh, I prefer pajamas."
495,00:29:19,00:29:23,Really? It was actually for my girlfriend here-- Miss Piggy.
496,00:29:23,00:29:25,We're experimenting on a pig again?
497,00:29:25,00:29:26,Yeah.
498,00:29:26,00:29:32,"You know, I-I-I haven't eaten meat since Grissom used one to estimate postmortem insect growth."
499,00:29:32,00:29:35,"Well, I tried for human volunteers, but no takers."
500,00:29:35,00:29:36,"What are you going to do, exactly?"
501,00:29:36,00:29:37,What arewegoing to do?
502,00:29:37,00:29:42,We're disproving the existence of spontaneous human combustion.
503,00:29:42,00:29:43,You do not give up.
504,00:29:43,00:29:46,"Well, we're recreating the death of Nadine Winston, right?"
505,00:29:46,00:29:52,She was wearing a cotton nightgown-- thank you-- and she had a half a pack of smokes on her end table which means she was probably smoking.
506,00:29:52,00:29:57,"If she burned herself with a cigarette she would've woken up, not burned up."
507,00:29:57,00:29:59,Best part: toxicology sample came back.
508,00:29:59,00:30:02,Nadine had a high concentration of Seconal in her blood.
509,00:30:02,00:30:04,Sleeping pills.
510,00:30:04,00:30:06,Enough to knock out a horse.
511,00:30:07,00:30:10,All right.
512,00:30:15,00:30:17,Care for a light?
513,00:30:28,00:30:30,Now what?
514,00:30:30,00:30:33,We wait.
515,00:30:35,00:30:38,"WILLOWS: Hi, Tammy."
516,00:30:38,00:30:40,"We just, uh, want to look around."
517,00:30:40,00:30:41,We have a warrant.
518,00:30:41,00:30:43,A warrant for what?
519,00:30:43,00:30:46,Any evidence linking you to the murder of your father.
520,00:30:46,00:30:48,"Tammy, could you step outside?"
521,00:30:48,00:30:49,This officer will keep you company.
522,00:31:05,00:31:06,(clears throat)
523,00:31:08,00:31:09,What?
524,00:31:09,00:31:11,I should get a finder's fee.
525,00:31:16,00:31:18,Here. One for each of you.
526,00:31:21,00:31:23,Yellow paint.
527,00:31:23,00:31:25,Shall we test for uranium?
528,00:31:26,00:31:29,I need a darkroom.
529,00:31:40,00:31:45,"Now, if uranium is present the photons should react with the film."
530,00:32:11,00:32:13,"Well, that's affirmative for uranium."
531,00:32:13,00:32:15,"Nicely done, Nick."
532,00:32:15,00:32:17,Thanks.
533,00:32:29,00:32:30,"Miss, have you ever worn these gloves?"
534,00:32:30,00:32:33,No. They belonged to my mother.
535,00:32:35,00:32:37,"Really? Well, we'll see."
536,00:32:41,00:32:45,"Tammy, I need your right index finger."
537,00:33:31,00:33:34,It's a perfect match.
538,00:33:35,00:33:38,Joe lanced the safe.
539,00:33:38,00:33:46,Once the safe was cracked you seized the moment and bashed his head in-- three blows.
540,00:33:49,00:33:51,"Nick, call Brass."
541,00:33:51,00:33:54,Tell him it's time to make an arrest.
542,00:33:54,00:33:56,Done.
543,00:33:56,00:33:58,You're making a mistake.
544,00:33:58,00:34:00,I didn't kill my father.
545,00:34:01,00:34:04,We weren't alone.
546,00:34:04,00:34:09,"I'm sorry, but there's no evidence to indicate that there was a third person present at the crime scene."
547,00:34:09,00:34:11,Who else was there?
548,00:34:11,00:34:15,"I tried to stop her, I swear."
549,00:34:15,00:34:17,Tammy...
550,00:34:19,00:34:20,Who was with you?
551,00:34:22,00:34:24,Melissa Marlowe.
552,00:34:27,00:34:31,But that bitch wouldn't listen.
553,00:34:31,00:34:33,So we're looking at a split personality?
554,00:34:33,00:34:34,Quite possible.
555,00:34:34,00:34:37,Two personalities in one.
556,00:34:37,00:34:40,Is there any scientific evidence that supports this disorder?
557,00:34:40,00:34:46,Brain scans have documented changes in the hippocampus of individuals shifting from one personality to another.
558,00:34:46,00:34:49,But would these two personalities be aware of each other?
559,00:34:49,00:34:53,"Well, usually the dominant personality is aware of everything."
560,00:34:54,00:34:57,The subjugated personality is only aware of itself.
561,00:34:57,00:34:58,Tammy's the dominant personality.
562,00:34:58,00:35:03,WILLOWS: But Melissa killed Joseph Felton-- Tammy's father.
563,00:35:03,00:35:07,Who was also Melissa's kidnapper.
564,00:35:07,00:35:11,BRASS: But revenge for a kidnapping 21 years after the fact?
565,00:35:11,00:35:12,"Well, itispossible."
566,00:35:12,00:35:16,It may have taken that long for the subjugated personality to break free.
567,00:35:17,00:35:22,"BRASS: Maybe, uh, Miss Mirror Has Two Faces is playing us for fools."
568,00:35:22,00:35:28,"We corner her with the evidence, she goes nuts sets the groundwork for an insanity plea."
569,00:35:28,00:35:30,Forensic Psychology is a science.
570,00:35:30,00:35:32,We have to stay open to all the possibilities.
571,00:35:33,00:35:34,(knocking)
572,00:35:34,00:35:36,Captain? Yeah?
573,00:35:36,00:35:38,The girl's parents are here with her attorney.
574,00:35:38,00:35:40,"Well, this ought to be interesting."
575,00:35:48,00:35:50,Melissa...
576,00:35:50,00:35:55,"Lady, I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are."
577,00:35:55,00:36:01,I'm not Melissa; I'm Tammy-- Tammy Felton.
578,00:36:01,00:36:04,"Tammy, my name is Randy Painter. I'm a defense attorney."
579,00:36:04,00:36:06,The Marlowes have hired me to defend you.
580,00:36:06,00:36:08,I didn't kill my father.
581,00:36:09,00:36:15,"Melissa, I don't know what you've been told but you're our daughter."
582,00:36:15,00:36:17,You were taken from us.
583,00:36:17,00:36:19,We've spent the last 21 years looking for you.
584,00:36:19,00:36:25,"My father was Joseph, my mother was Mara and they're both dead."
585,00:36:25,00:36:26,Bail's been set at half a million dollars.
586,00:36:37,00:36:40,Are you looking at my necklace?
587,00:36:43,00:36:48,Your father bought this for me when you were born and you used to play with it.
588,00:36:55,00:36:58,And we're not going to let you go to jai.
589,00:36:59,00:37:00,"Right, Hank?"
590,00:37:00,00:37:03,Raising even ten percent won't be easy.
591,00:37:03,00:37:04,(sobbing)
592,00:37:04,00:37:07,"Hank, she's not spending another night away from us."
593,00:37:07,00:37:08,Whatever it takes.
594,00:37:08,00:37:09,When are we due in court?
595,00:37:09,00:37:11,"The prelim's tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m."
596,00:37:11,00:37:13,Then I'd better hurry with bail.
597,00:37:30,00:37:32,"I just got back to the lab, saw the smoke. What's up?"
598,00:37:32,00:37:34,We're just working the case.
599,00:37:34,00:37:37,"Yeah, we're disproving spontaneous human combustion."
600,00:37:37,00:37:40,We dressed a pig up in a cotton dress and torched it with a cigarette.
601,00:37:40,00:37:42,And what happened?
602,00:37:42,00:37:44,The pig's been reduced to ash.
603,00:37:44,00:37:47,"The fat acted like candle wax; burned hot, slow and intense."
604,00:37:47,00:37:50,Nothing spontaneous about it.
605,00:37:50,00:37:55,"You both knew there would be a scientific explanation for the human torch, though, right?"
606,00:37:55,00:37:56,Of course.
607,00:37:59,00:38:00,Did you find the wick?
608,00:38:00,00:38:01,The wick?
609,00:38:01,00:38:03,The what?
610,00:38:03,00:38:08,A piece of fabric that's scorched but not completely burned...
611,00:38:08,00:38:10,like possibly from the nightgown.
612,00:38:12,00:38:14,We found the same thing at the crime scene.
613,00:38:14,00:38:15,It's called the wick effect.
614,00:38:15,00:38:17,It's like an inside-out candle.
615,00:38:17,00:38:23,"The fabric acts like a wick, and the body burns inward explaining the high temperatures which destroy the bone."
616,00:38:23,00:38:27,"The fabric ends up scorched, but not completely burned."
617,00:38:27,00:38:28,You knew about the ashes?
618,00:38:28,00:38:30,Why didn't you say something when you gave us the case?
619,00:38:30,00:38:34,"Well, in science we learn through experimentation, right?"
620,00:38:34,00:38:36,Sometimes we need to see it to believe it.
621,00:38:36,00:38:39,You guys did a nice job.
622,00:38:39,00:38:42,Now you have to clean it up.
623,00:38:45,00:38:48,"Well, I would've looked like an idiot."
624,00:38:50,00:38:51,Thanks for covering.
625,00:38:51,00:38:54,"Well, you can show your appreciation by, uh, cleaning up."
626,00:38:55,00:38:57,Done.
627,00:38:58,00:38:59,Thank you.
628,00:39:04,00:39:06,I got a call that Melissa wanted to see me.
629,00:39:06,00:39:09,Thanks for coming.
630,00:39:09,00:39:12,Am I speaking to Melissa... or Tammy?
631,00:39:12,00:39:13,Melissa.
632,00:39:13,00:39:15,I know who I am now...
633,00:39:15,00:39:20,after spending time with my real parents.
634,00:39:20,00:39:21,I'm not an attorney.
635,00:39:21,00:39:23,There are no privileges here.
636,00:39:23,00:39:24,Whatever you say...
637,00:39:24,00:39:26,What are my chances... in court?
638,00:39:26,00:39:30,The evidence is damaging.
639,00:39:30,00:39:33,If I plead insanity...?
640,00:39:33,00:39:36,You have a lawyer. Why are you asking me?
641,00:39:36,00:39:38,You wanted to help me.
642,00:39:38,00:39:42,"When I ID'd Joe, you were kind."
643,00:39:44,00:39:48,I need you to testify that I was not sane at the time that I killed Joe.
644,00:39:49,00:39:53,My lawyer says that would go a really long way with a jury.
645,00:39:54,00:39:56,I'm not an expert.
646,00:39:56,00:39:57,But it doesn't matter.
647,00:39:57,00:39:58,You spent time with me.
648,00:39:58,00:40:00,You could answer questions the right way.
649,00:40:04,00:40:14,I can't explain what happened in that room today but it's like... the only memories I have are of being a little kid.
650,00:40:15,00:40:21,The last 21 years are a blank-- like they never happened.
651,00:40:26,00:40:29,Then you shouldn't have any memories of me...
652,00:40:29,00:40:31,Tammy.
653,00:40:34,00:40:37,"There is no Melissa, is there?"
654,00:40:37,00:40:42,Get the hell out of here.
655,00:40:44,00:40:45,I'm gone.
656,00:40:47,00:40:49,(little girl voice): Don't go!
657,00:40:53,00:40:56,Don't leave me here with her.
658,00:40:58,00:41:01,(normal voice): Just practicing for court.
659,00:41:01,00:41:02,"Not bad, huh?"
660,00:41:04,00:41:05,Guard.
661,00:41:26,00:41:29,"Hey, come on, we're going to be late for the prelim."
662,00:41:29,00:41:32,Tammy Felton's prelim's been postponed indefinitely.
663,00:41:32,00:41:34,What? Why?
664,00:41:34,00:41:36,She left town. Skipped bail.
665,00:41:36,00:41:40,How much did the parents lose?
666,00:41:40,00:41:42,Their house and their life savings.
667,00:41:44,00:41:47,It's over.
668,00:41:47,00:41:48,Case closed.
669,00:41:48,00:41:51,We move on.
670,00:41:51,00:41:53,Right.
671,00:41:57,00:41:58,"Brass, it's Catherine."
672,00:41:59,00:42:02,I need a credit card purchase report on the Marlowes.
673,00:42:02,00:42:03,The last 24 hours.
674,00:42:03,00:42:04,Based on what?
675,00:42:04,00:42:09,Based on the fact that the Marlowes are blind when it comes to their daughter and would do anything for her.
676,00:42:09,00:42:11,We have no idea where she is.
677,00:42:11,00:42:16,"Look, you're here, she's not and we know that you helped her flee the jurisdiction."
678,00:42:16,00:42:17,What?
679,00:42:17,00:42:20,22 bus tickets bought with your credit card to 22 different states?
680,00:42:21,00:42:23,You made sure that we couldn't track her.
681,00:42:24,00:42:26,"Now, that's aiding and abetting the flight of a suspected felon."
682,00:42:26,00:42:33,Wherever you think she is-- wherever you're planning on meeting her-- she's not there.
683,00:42:33,00:42:34,She played you.
684,00:42:34,00:42:40,"Now, if you'll just tell us where she is, we won't file charges, right?"
685,00:42:40,00:42:42,"Well, if she's apprehended, yes."
686,00:42:43,00:42:45,Otherwise it's a felony.
687,00:42:45,00:42:47,You're going to jail.
688,00:42:47,00:42:51,Arrest us.
689,00:42:51,00:42:55,Think about what you're doing.
690,00:42:55,00:42:57,We know exactly what we're doing.
691,00:42:57,00:42:58,Melissa's free.
692,00:42:58,00:43:00,That's all that matters.
693,00:43:04,00:43:06,Frankie?
694,00:43:08,00:43:09,BRASS: You have the right to remain silent.
695,00:43:10,00:43:13,Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
696,00:44:01,00:44:03,Am I late?
697,00:44:03,00:44:05,"Oh, you're worth waiting for."
698,00:44:07,00:44:09,"You owe me one, Darin."
699,00:44:09,00:44:10,Owe you?
700,00:44:10,00:44:12,I'm the one that told you the truth about your father.
701,00:44:13,00:44:15,And you knew exactly what I'd do about it.
702,00:44:24,00:44:26,Where to?
703,00:44:26,00:44:28,Does it matter?
