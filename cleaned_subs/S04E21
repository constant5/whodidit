1,00:00:19,00:00:22,I don't wanna go!
2,00:00:22,00:00:24,Whoa! Ooh!
3,00:00:24,00:00:26,"Oh, Mommy."
4,00:00:27,00:00:29,We're all going to die.
5,00:00:30,00:00:32,"Joey, put your seat belt on. NOW."
6,00:00:36,00:00:37,"Hold on tight, here we go!"
7,00:00:37,00:00:40,(screaming)
8,00:01:02,00:01:04,"Okay, guys, come on."
9,00:01:04,00:01:06,That was so fun.
10,00:01:06,00:01:10,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pharaoh's Fever."
11,00:01:10,00:01:12,Buckle up. Get ready to scream.
12,00:01:14,00:01:17,That was so awesome.
13,00:01:17,00:01:20,"Um, we'll ride it in a minute."
14,00:01:20,00:01:25,"Um, four King Tut burgers, uh, two Nile River ice teas and two milks."
15,00:01:25,00:01:28,Milk is nasty. Yeah.
16,00:01:28,00:01:31,(screaming)
17,00:01:41,00:01:44,(sirens blaring)
18,00:01:58,00:02:02,"So, Dr. Thrillseeker, you ever been on this roller coaster?"
19,00:02:02,00:02:04,"GRISSOM: Pharaoh's Fever, yeah..."
20,00:02:05,00:02:08,but my ride ended at the platform.
21,00:02:10,00:02:11,What do you know?
22,00:02:12,00:02:14,BRASS: Six dead.
23,00:02:14,00:02:20,Park full of eyewitnesses saw the train fly off the tracks. 401B.
24,00:02:20,00:02:21,Accident with injury.
25,00:02:21,00:02:22,BRASS: Uh-huh.
26,00:02:22,00:02:24,GRISSOM: It's also a 418B.
27,00:02:24,00:02:27,A runaway?
28,00:02:28,00:02:30,A runaway train.
29,00:03:08,00:03:09,Hey.
30,00:03:09,00:03:10,Sorry we're late.
31,00:03:10,00:03:13,There was a news van blocking the entrance.
32,00:03:13,00:03:16,This is the first time a roller coaster has derailed in Clark County.
33,00:03:16,00:03:20,"Huge criminal and civil liabilities issues, so keep it quiet."
34,00:03:20,00:03:22,Photograph the scene.
35,00:03:22,00:03:24,Bag and tag all the detritus.
36,00:03:25,00:03:26,Forklift anything bigger than Greg.
37,00:03:26,00:03:32,We're going to put up a tent on the other side of the parking lot for accident reconstruction. Questions?
38,00:03:32,00:03:37,Yeah. What's that guy doing so far away from the others?
39,00:03:38,00:03:41,"Curious, isn't it?"
40,00:03:41,00:03:46,"So, when he asks if anybody has any questions, he's not really asking?"
41,00:03:46,00:03:54,"Well, I don't know much about roller coaster accidents, but in auto collisions, the victims found furthest away from the car usually weren't wearing a seat belt."
42,00:03:54,00:03:56,That'd be my bet.
43,00:03:56,00:03:58,(screaming)
44,00:04:01,00:04:04,"STOKES: Okay, let's go to work."
45,00:04:04,00:04:05,What should I do?
46,00:04:05,00:04:10,"Photo-evidence log-- just record everything we collect, okay?"
47,00:04:25,00:04:28,Couple of mountain bikers called in the body.
48,00:04:28,00:04:30,Coroner just arrived.
49,00:04:32,00:04:34,"WILLOWS: Hi, David."
50,00:04:34,00:04:36,Hey.
51,00:04:37,00:04:38,Tessa Press.
52,00:04:38,00:04:41,School I.D. was in her pocket.
53,00:04:41,00:04:42,She's 13.
54,00:04:42,00:04:45,I hate these cases.
55,00:04:45,00:04:50,Now... the body position is inconsistent with her lividity.
56,00:04:51,00:04:54,"After she died, blood settled to her anterior and lividity fixed."
57,00:04:54,00:04:56,So she had been facedown.
58,00:04:56,00:04:57,Yeah.
59,00:04:58,00:05:00,And someone dumped her face up.
60,00:05:00,00:05:02,How long has she been here?
61,00:05:02,00:05:06,I'll defer that question to the insects.
62,00:05:12,00:05:13,WILLOWS: Instar maggots.
63,00:05:14,00:05:20,"Given the ambient temperature and last night's rain, I'd estimate she's been out here 24 hours."
64,00:05:20,00:05:24,Takes that long for blowfly eggs to hatch.
65,00:05:24,00:05:30,"I guess the rain would've washed away any trace evidence: tire prints, shoe impressions."
66,00:05:30,00:05:32,Let's just hope there's some evidence on her body.
67,00:05:32,00:05:37,"If you're going to drive all the way out here to dump a body, why not take another ten minutes and bury her?"
68,00:05:37,00:05:41,Guess it wasn't worth the killer's time.
69,00:06:19,00:06:21,(metal screeching)
70,00:06:34,00:06:36,"So, how long you been operating the roller coaster?"
71,00:06:36,00:06:38,Couple of months. I got a promotion.
72,00:06:38,00:06:39,I used to work the merry-go-round.
73,00:06:40,00:06:41,"That's a promotion, huh?"
74,00:06:41,00:06:44,Yeah. Only little kids go on the merry-go-round.
75,00:06:44,00:06:48,"Oh, I see. So you get to meet girls your own age on Pharaoh's Fever."
76,00:06:48,00:06:50,"Yeah, something like that."
77,00:06:50,00:06:53,What kind of training do you get to be an operator?
78,00:06:53,00:06:55,Training? I release the brake.
79,00:06:55,00:06:57,I press a button.
80,00:06:57,00:06:58,"It's green and marked ""start""."
81,00:06:58,00:07:00,I get the picture.
82,00:07:00,00:07:01,"All right, look, there are six victims."
83,00:07:01,00:07:04,It'd be helpful to know where each of them was sitting.
84,00:07:04,00:07:06,Um...
85,00:07:06,00:07:08,front bench was a girl.
86,00:07:08,00:07:09,She was blond.
87,00:07:09,00:07:11,Yeah? Cute.
88,00:07:14,00:07:18,"Uh, followed by a punk, old folks and some other dude."
89,00:07:20,00:07:21,That's only five.
90,00:07:21,00:07:24,That's all I remember.
91,00:07:26,00:07:28,"BRASS: ""See yourself scream""?"
92,00:07:28,00:07:30,What's this about? We got a digital camera.
93,00:07:30,00:07:31,It's mounted right over there.
94,00:07:32,00:07:34,BRASS: How does that work?
95,00:07:34,00:07:35,Camera's on a trigger.
96,00:07:35,00:07:40,"Train passes by, automatically snaps a picture and stores it in the computer's hard drive."
97,00:07:40,00:07:41,The train was airborne.
98,00:07:41,00:07:44,Never even got close to the camera.
99,00:07:44,00:07:47,I'm still going to want to take that computer.
100,00:07:53,00:07:56,I'm the park's chief engineer.
101,00:07:56,00:08:00,Been working on coasters since before I was tall enough to ride 'em.
102,00:08:00,00:08:03,GRISSOM: You responsible for maintaining this roller coaster?
103,00:08:03,00:08:04,I keep all the rides up to code.
104,00:08:04,00:08:08,You have any idea what would cause this train to go off the track?
105,00:08:08,00:08:10,"Well, in theory, I didn't think it was possible."
106,00:08:10,00:08:12,There's never been an accident like this anywhere.
107,00:08:13,00:08:15,"So, you're an expert?"
108,00:08:15,00:08:17,On roller coasters? Hell yeah.
109,00:08:17,00:08:21,Ten years of service on Six Flags' American Eagle before moving to Vegas.
110,00:08:21,00:08:23,Do you know what that is?
111,00:08:23,00:08:27,"That's a nut. It, uh... secures the wheel to the screw."
112,00:08:27,00:08:29,"Well, one loose screw..."
113,00:08:29,00:08:33,"couldn't cause a train to derail, could it?"
114,00:08:33,00:08:36,"No, no, there's, uh... eight wheels per train."
115,00:08:36,00:08:38,"They-they'd all have to be loose, and, uh..."
116,00:08:38,00:08:40,that just doesn't happen.
117,00:08:52,00:08:55,"""There are three things in human life ""that are important."
118,00:08:55,00:09:05,"""The first is to be kind; ""the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind."" Henry James."
119,00:09:05,00:09:10,Very good. Author of one of the greatest horror stories ever written: Turn of the Screw.
120,00:09:10,00:09:11,And I'm looking for one.
121,00:09:12,00:09:13,SIDLE: A screw? Yes.
122,00:09:13,00:09:15,"Oh, well..."
123,00:09:15,00:09:18,"technically, these are eccentric shafts, not screws."
124,00:09:18,00:09:22,"Well, as long as you can screw a nut on it, it's a screw."
125,00:09:23,00:09:24,Turn of the Screw isn't really a horror story.
126,00:09:25,00:09:26,It's more of a mystery.
127,00:09:26,00:09:28,"Did the governess kill the little boy, or did the ghost do it?"
128,00:09:28,00:09:31,"Well, it's only a mystery if you believe in ghosts."
129,00:09:33,00:09:36,End threads are stripped.
130,00:09:36,00:09:37,Means the nuts were loose.
131,00:09:37,00:09:40,Excessive play on the screws would've worn down the threads.
132,00:09:40,00:09:42,And the nuts would've popped off.
133,00:09:47,00:09:50,Nuts don't just pop off by themselves.
134,00:09:53,00:09:55,GRISSOM: We got tool marks.
135,00:09:55,00:09:59,"Vertical striations, evenly spaced."
136,00:09:59,00:10:01,Could've been a pipe wrench.
137,00:10:01,00:10:05,Maybe whoever maintains the roller coaster uses a pipe wrench to tighten the nuts.
138,00:10:05,00:10:09,Or whoever loosened the nuts screwed up.
139,00:10:19,00:10:23,It's Tessa.
140,00:10:23,00:10:26,I don't understand.
141,00:10:28,00:10:29,How could this...?
142,00:10:34,00:10:36,My baby.
143,00:10:39,00:10:42,I'm very sorry.
144,00:10:43,00:10:46,"She's beautiful, isn't she?"
145,00:10:48,00:10:54,"Ma'am, the coroner believes that Tessa died over 24 hours ago."
146,00:10:54,00:10:56,Had you reported her missing?
147,00:10:58,00:11:02,"Couple nights a week, she'd sleep at her friend Carrie's."
148,00:11:02,00:11:06,There's just the two of us.
149,00:11:06,00:11:09,I'm a waitress. Work nights.
150,00:11:09,00:11:11,That way I can...
151,00:11:11,00:11:16,make her breakfast and be there when she gets home from school.
152,00:11:17,00:11:20,When was the last time that you saw her?
153,00:11:20,00:11:22,Yesterday morning.
154,00:11:22,00:11:26,I got home around 6:00.
155,00:11:26,00:11:29,We made pancakes.
156,00:11:30,00:11:33,I packed her lunch and kissed her good-bye.
157,00:11:37,00:11:42,"When she didn't come home from school, I just figured she was at Carrie's."
158,00:11:45,00:11:51,"I should have called, but I didn't want to be a nag."
159,00:11:54,00:11:56,I want to see her.
160,00:11:58,00:12:04,"Officer, could you please escort Ms. Press... to the morgue."
161,00:12:20,00:12:24,When's the last time you went 24 hours without talking to Lindsey?
162,00:12:24,00:12:26,"A single mother, working nights."
163,00:12:26,00:12:30,"I'm just saying, she didn't check on her own kid, you know?"
164,00:12:30,00:12:34,"Ah, you do the best you can."
165,00:12:34,00:12:36,Introductions.
166,00:12:38,00:12:39,"Shelly Hoffman, 25."
167,00:12:39,00:12:42,Cause of death-- lacerated ventricle.
168,00:12:42,00:12:43,"Noah Nuland, 15."
169,00:12:44,00:12:46,C.O.D.-- head contusion.
170,00:12:46,00:12:49,The swelling of the brain killed him within minutes.
171,00:12:49,00:12:53,"Now, Gary Clodfelter died of shock."
172,00:12:53,00:12:55,"His wife, May, exsanguinated."
173,00:12:55,00:13:00,"And their son, Cameron-- another head contusion."
174,00:13:00,00:13:03,What about this guy?
175,00:13:03,00:13:04,"Jim Nevins, 20."
176,00:13:04,00:13:06,Park employee.
177,00:13:06,00:13:09,Died from a temporal herniation.
178,00:13:09,00:13:14,"Impact to the head caused the brain to swell, which, in turn, put pressure on the brain stem."
179,00:13:14,00:13:19,"According to the ride operator, there were only five passengers on the roller coaster, and no employees."
180,00:13:19,00:13:22,Right. So...
181,00:13:22,00:13:25,maybe Nevins was just an unfortunate bystander.
182,00:13:25,00:13:28,Hit in the head by a falling roller coaster.
183,00:13:28,00:13:30,The Chicken Little theory?
184,00:13:30,00:13:31,But here's the hitch.
185,00:13:32,00:13:34,The others died roughly ten hours ago.
186,00:13:34,00:13:37,Mr. Nevins' rigor mortis is fixed.
187,00:13:37,00:13:43,Body temp puts the time of his death approximately 16 hours before the others-- right around 1:00 A.M.
188,00:13:43,00:13:46,(sighing)
189,00:13:46,00:13:51,Albert... dead men don't ride roller coasters.
190,00:13:56,00:13:59,We're going to need to see the underside of the loading platform.
191,00:13:59,00:14:00,"Oh, follow me."
192,00:14:00,00:14:04,Rumor has it the park's going to shut down Pharaoh's Fever for good.
193,00:14:04,00:14:05,You know anything about that?
194,00:14:05,00:14:07,GRISSOM: No.
195,00:14:07,00:14:11,"Newspaper called it ""a death trap."" An accident waiting to happen."
196,00:14:11,00:14:12,You disagree with that?
197,00:14:12,00:14:16,"Well, she's old and wrinkled, but I took good care of her."
198,00:14:20,00:14:21,"Uh, Woody?"
199,00:14:22,00:14:23,We'd like to be alone.
200,00:14:25,00:14:26,Holler if you need anything.
201,00:14:48,00:14:51,"Well, easy access."
202,00:14:51,00:14:54,Wheels are in reach.
203,00:14:54,00:14:57,Anyone could have loosened the nuts from down here.
204,00:14:57,00:15:00,Check this out.
205,00:15:00,00:15:02,"Is that lubricant, maybe?"
206,00:15:02,00:15:03,It's a funny place for lubricant.
207,00:15:03,00:15:04,It's not even on the track.
208,00:15:04,00:15:06,I'll swab it.
209,00:15:07,00:15:10,(flapping)
210,00:15:12,00:15:15,"Hey, look at that."
211,00:15:17,00:15:19,That's worse than just a wrinkle.
212,00:15:19,00:15:21,It's got a support beam under it.
213,00:15:21,00:15:22,It's just a cosmetic problem.
214,00:15:22,00:15:24,"Sir, you need to step away."
215,00:15:24,00:15:26,We need some time.
216,00:15:26,00:15:29,This is an active investigation.
217,00:15:29,00:15:33,Were you aware that that support beam was detached?
218,00:15:33,00:15:34,"Well, hell, yeah."
219,00:15:34,00:15:36,Fixed it a half dozen times this year.
220,00:15:36,00:15:37,It's in my maintenance log.
221,00:15:37,00:15:41,"But like I said, that cross bar is supported by the metal beam."
222,00:15:41,00:15:47,"But since my hours were cut back last November, I've had to prioritize my ""fix-ums."" Hmm."
223,00:15:47,00:15:51,"Woody, we'd like to requisition your pipe wrench."
224,00:15:51,00:15:53,"It's, uh, not technically mine."
225,00:15:53,00:15:55,Are you the only one that uses it?
226,00:15:55,00:15:58,"Yeah, but it's the property of the park."
227,00:15:58,00:16:00,"Well, I promise we'll get it back to you."
228,00:16:03,00:16:04,(phone ringing)
229,00:16:04,00:16:06,Thank you.
230,00:16:07,00:16:09,Yeah?
231,00:16:09,00:16:12,I'm processing the dead park employee's clothing.
232,00:16:12,00:16:15,The shirt and the pants are covered in red fibers.
233,00:16:15,00:16:17,GRISSOM: Anything distinctive?
234,00:16:17,00:16:21,"Well, they're trilobal."
235,00:16:21,00:16:22,Very good.
236,00:16:22,00:16:23,"Thanks, Nick."
237,00:16:23,00:16:29,"Well, we need to find a car with a red interior."
238,00:16:29,00:16:31,SARA: Hi.
239,00:16:33,00:16:35,The roller coaster broke into 106 parts.
240,00:16:35,00:16:37,I just logged the final piece.
241,00:16:37,00:16:39,Good work.
242,00:16:39,00:16:42,"I found something a little unusual, for a roller coaster."
243,00:16:47,00:16:50,"Not a sailor, but a..."
244,00:16:50,00:16:52,Semen?
245,00:16:52,00:16:53,Sex on the roller coaster?
246,00:16:54,00:16:56,Or some kid shaking hands with Shorty.
247,00:16:58,00:17:05,The release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a roller coaster can produce a stimulatory effect.
248,00:17:05,00:17:07,It enhances ejaculation.
249,00:17:07,00:17:10,Right. But is it probative to our investigation?
250,00:17:10,00:17:15,"Well, um, why don't you swab a sample, and you can tell us."
251,00:17:15,00:17:18,"Greg, do we know who the R.O. of this T-Bird is?"
252,00:17:18,00:17:19,Uh...
253,00:17:19,00:17:21,Jim Nevins.
254,00:17:21,00:17:23,The dead employee.
255,00:17:23,00:17:26,I didn't realize the cars were relevant to our investigation.
256,00:17:26,00:17:30,"Everything's relevant Greg, until it's not."
257,00:17:36,00:17:38,Grissom.
258,00:17:43,00:17:45,Take a look at this.
259,00:17:45,00:17:47,A pipe wrench.
260,00:17:50,00:17:52,Blood.
261,00:17:52,00:17:54,"Greg, may I?"
262,00:18:01,00:18:04,Blood pool.
263,00:18:04,00:18:07,Camouflaged by the red carpet.
264,00:18:07,00:18:10,That explains the autopsy findings.
265,00:18:10,00:18:13,Nevins may have never been in the roller coaster.
266,00:18:13,00:18:17,Possibly killed by that wrench and stuffed in his own trunk.
267,00:18:17,00:18:18,"And, uh, then what?"
268,00:18:18,00:18:24,"A renegade roller coaster comes along 16 hours later, and propels Nevin's body from the trunk to the blacktop?"
269,00:18:24,00:18:25,I'm just following the evidence.
270,00:18:26,00:18:31,"I'll call Brass, see if he can find an eyewitness that can place the car in the parking lot at the time of Nevin's death."
271,00:18:35,00:18:38,"Uh, so, Woody said that I might be able to help you with your investigation."
272,00:18:38,00:18:41,"Zack, you close up shop at the Sphinx at night."
273,00:18:41,00:18:42,"Yeah, Monday to Friday."
274,00:18:42,00:18:43,"Uh, class till 3:00."
275,00:18:44,00:18:47,"Tutor kids in math till 5:00, and then I head over to the park."
276,00:18:47,00:18:48,We close at 10:00.
277,00:18:48,00:18:54,Did you notice any cars in the parking lot after closing on Thursday night?
278,00:18:54,00:18:57,Jimmy Nevins. His red T-Bird was out there.
279,00:18:57,00:18:58,"Oh, you know Jimmy?"
280,00:18:58,00:19:00,"Yeah, sure; pretty cool guy."
281,00:19:00,00:19:01,Worked the bumper cars.
282,00:19:01,00:19:05,"I still can't believe what happened, you know?"
283,00:19:05,00:19:09,"I mean, I must have rode that coaster, like, 100 times, maybe more."
284,00:19:09,00:19:12,"Anyway, sometimes Jimmy stayed after closing."
285,00:19:12,00:19:14,Why?
286,00:19:14,00:19:21,"Look, I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble, but occasionally, Jimmy would take his... dates for rides on The Fever, you know?"
287,00:19:21,00:19:23,Everybody knew about it. It was really no big deal.
288,00:19:23,00:19:26,Do you happen to know the name of his date on Thursday night?
289,00:19:26,00:19:28,"No, sorry."
290,00:19:28,00:19:30,How did Jimmy get access to the park?
291,00:19:30,00:19:33,"I mean, all the power is shut down at night."
292,00:19:33,00:19:37,The same key that opens up the men's room door opens up all the power boxes at the park.
293,00:19:37,00:19:38,No kidding.
294,00:19:38,00:19:40,It's just hanging outside Woody's office.
295,00:19:40,00:19:42,What about security?
296,00:19:42,00:19:45,Nope. Night guy got laid off.
297,00:19:45,00:19:46,Budget cuts last winter.
298,00:19:46,00:19:50,"It's not like anybody's going break into an amusement park and steal a coaster, you know?"
299,00:19:51,00:19:53,DAVID PHILLIPS: X-rayed Tessa's neck.
300,00:19:53,00:19:59,"Blade appears to have perforated her fifth cervical intervertebral disc, lacerating the spinal cord."
301,00:20:01,00:20:06,Type of trauma suggests we're looking at asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis.
302,00:20:09,00:20:13,It looks like there's soil inside of her wound.
303,00:20:13,00:20:15,"Well, we did find her outside."
304,00:20:15,00:20:18,Right.
305,00:20:18,00:20:21,Should be soil around the wound.
306,00:20:21,00:20:25,"And on the wound, but not inside of it."
307,00:21:37,00:21:39,"Oh, I am the man."
308,00:21:39,00:21:41,Are you?
309,00:21:41,00:21:45,I microsilled the pipe wrenches you and Sara turned into evidence.
310,00:21:45,00:21:48,I excluded Woody's wrench.
311,00:21:48,00:21:51,Take a look at the tool marks from the wrench found in the T-bird.
312,00:21:51,00:21:52,"On the left, the sabotaged nut."
313,00:21:52,00:21:55,"On the right, the test marks."
314,00:21:55,00:21:57,Perfect match.
315,00:21:57,00:21:58,I have a theory.
316,00:21:58,00:22:01,Maybe Jim Nevins sabotaged the roller coaster.
317,00:22:06,00:22:11,"When he left the park, someone attacked him, grabbed his wrench and hit him over the head with it."
318,00:22:18,00:22:19,Did you any prints off the wrench?
319,00:22:19,00:22:20,I got a partial.
320,00:22:21,00:22:22,And I had a tech print the T-Bird.
321,00:22:22,00:22:25,Found two sets of prints on the trunk's lid.
322,00:22:25,00:22:30,"One belonged to the vic, the other unknown, but it did match the partial."
323,00:22:32,00:22:38,That semen from the coaster's cab was just processed in my lab.
324,00:22:38,00:22:40,"All I can say is, Nevins was a cad."
325,00:22:41,00:22:43,Semen match the dead guy's?
326,00:22:43,00:22:48,"Yup. And Sara spoke to Brass, who says Nevins was known for taking girls on private rides."
327,00:22:48,00:22:50,Pharaoh's Fever was his Spanish fly.
328,00:22:50,00:22:53,"Well, there goes my theory."
329,00:22:53,00:22:56,No one tampers with their sex machine.
330,00:22:58,00:23:01,"(typing, computer beeping)"
331,00:23:01,00:23:03,Multitrack digital camera snaps photos of all the passengers.
332,00:23:03,00:23:07,"The park finally sent over their computer, so I'm scanning through the day of the accident."
333,00:23:08,00:23:10,"Can you go back in time, to the night before?"
334,00:23:10,00:23:12,Yeah. Why?
335,00:23:12,00:23:14,Jim Nevins may have been on that coaster.
336,00:23:14,00:23:16,I want to see if anyone was with him.
337,00:23:16,00:23:17,(typing)
338,00:23:17,00:23:18,(computer beeps)
339,00:23:23,00:23:25,Oh. So much for safe sex.
340,00:23:25,00:23:27,Who's the girl?
341,00:23:27,00:23:28,Reverse one more pic.
342,00:23:28,00:23:30,(typing)
343,00:23:32,00:23:35,"Now, that picture's worth five bucks."
344,00:23:35,00:23:39,Last time stamp of the night was 12:45 a.m.
345,00:23:39,00:23:41,Coroner placed Nevins' T.O.D at 1:00 a.m.
346,00:23:41,00:23:43,We need to find that girl.
347,00:23:47,00:23:49,WILLOWS: Hey.
348,00:23:49,00:23:50,BROWN: Hey.
349,00:23:50,00:23:52,Got your page. What's up?
350,00:23:52,00:23:55,"Tessa Press took the bus to and from school, not far from here. Mm-hmm."
351,00:23:56,00:23:57,I showed her picture to the mini-mart manager.
352,00:23:58,00:24:00,She remembers seeing her the day that she was killed.
353,00:24:00,00:24:02,Wow.
354,00:24:02,00:24:04,This place is crawling with kids.
355,00:24:04,00:24:05,She remembers her?
356,00:24:05,00:24:09,She says she came in every afternoon and bought a Little Debbie and a soda.
357,00:24:09,00:24:11,"Have we tracked down her friend, Carrie?"
358,00:24:11,00:24:18,"Officer Ray did speak with Carrie and her parents, and they confirmed that Tessa spent at least two nights a week over their place."
359,00:24:18,00:24:20,And was she supposed to sleep over the day that she was killed?
360,00:24:20,00:24:21,I don't think they had any kind of a schedule.
361,00:24:22,00:24:25,"She would just show up, and when she didn't, they'd assumed that she was at home."
362,00:24:26,00:24:27,Warrick.
363,00:24:27,00:24:29,I've already secured the footage.
364,00:24:43,00:24:46,"Oh, roller coaster wacko at 12:00."
365,00:24:47,00:24:49,I heard you were looking for someone.
366,00:24:49,00:24:51,"Sir, do you recognize this young woman?"
367,00:24:53,00:24:55,"Oh, sure, it's Cleopatra."
368,00:24:56,00:24:57,She works in food services.
369,00:24:57,00:24:59,Second pyramid on the left.
370,00:24:59,00:25:01,"Thank you, Woody."
371,00:25:10,00:25:11,"MAN: Hey, can I help you?"
372,00:25:11,00:25:13,"Actually, we're looking for Cleopatra."
373,00:25:13,00:25:14,She's on break.
374,00:25:14,00:25:16,But can I get you anything?
375,00:25:17,00:25:19,"No, thanks."
376,00:25:24,00:25:26,Quadratic equations?
377,00:25:26,00:25:29,That's not easy.
378,00:25:29,00:25:31,Glad you think so.
379,00:25:31,00:25:32,"I have a ""D"" average."
380,00:25:32,00:25:35,"If I fail the final, my family's going to Hawaii without me."
381,00:25:35,00:25:36,We're with the crime lab.
382,00:25:40,00:25:42,We have some questions.
383,00:25:45,00:25:49,I had no idea those cameras worked at night.
384,00:25:49,00:25:51,Is your name really Cleopatra?
385,00:25:51,00:25:53,Lisa. Lisa Hunt.
386,00:25:53,00:25:57,"Lisa, you know your friend in this photograph is dead, right?"
387,00:25:57,00:26:00,Right.
388,00:26:00,00:26:02,You don't seem too upset about that.
389,00:26:02,00:26:09,"D.L. on Jimmy Nevins: Four years ago, when I was a frosh and he was a senior, he was my Jordan Catalano."
390,00:26:09,00:26:11,Know what I mean?
391,00:26:11,00:26:13,But he didn't know my name.
392,00:26:13,00:26:26,"So four years later, when I started working here, he's still working here-- total loser, but still really hot-- so when he asked me out, there was only one answer: ""When and where?"" After hours at the roller coaster."
393,00:26:26,00:26:30,"I know, I thought the same thing-- Cheez Whiz."
394,00:26:30,00:26:32,"But, I mean, what the hell?"
395,00:26:32,00:26:34,I'd never done it on a roller coaster.
396,00:26:35,00:26:36,It was your first date.
397,00:26:37,00:26:39,You sound like my mother.
398,00:26:39,00:26:42,"Oh, God, you're not going to tell her, are you?"
399,00:26:42,00:26:43,I just turned 18.
400,00:26:43,00:26:45,"There is nothing statutory about it, I swear."
401,00:26:45,00:26:50,"Lisa, we need to know what the two of you did when you got off the ride."
402,00:26:50,00:26:51,We talked.
403,00:26:51,00:26:54,"I mean, not that he had much to say."
404,00:26:55,00:27:01,"He offered to drive me home, but I only live a few blocks from here, so I told him I'd huff it."
405,00:27:01,00:27:04,"Mm, we kissed-- way too much slobber."
406,00:27:04,00:27:06,And that was it.
407,00:27:06,00:27:08,Was there anyone else around?
408,00:27:08,00:27:11,"I-I didn't see anybody, but I wasn't really looking."
409,00:27:19,00:27:22,I found Tessa.
410,00:27:22,00:27:24,"WILLOW: Yeah, you're not the only one."
411,00:27:24,00:27:25,Yeah.
412,00:27:25,00:27:27,Can you enlarge it?
413,00:27:27,00:27:29,(typing)
414,00:27:29,00:27:31,(machine whirring)
415,00:27:37,00:27:39,"Yeah, that's me."
416,00:27:39,00:27:40,And who's that with you?
417,00:27:40,00:27:41,Tessa Press.
418,00:27:41,00:27:43,You two were friends?
419,00:27:43,00:27:45,We sat next to each other on the bus.
420,00:27:45,00:27:47,She was 13.
421,00:27:47,00:27:48,How old are you?
422,00:27:48,00:27:49,What's that supposed to mean?
423,00:27:49,00:27:52,"No, Mom, it's okay."
424,00:27:52,00:27:54,I-I'm 15.
425,00:27:54,00:27:56,I felt sorry for her.
426,00:27:56,00:27:57,The girls picked on her.
427,00:27:57,00:27:59,"Made fun of her frizzy hair, her old clothes."
428,00:27:59,00:28:00,Stuff like that.
429,00:28:01,00:28:05,"She'd sit next to me, and they'd leave her alone."
430,00:28:05,00:28:07,"In the photo, you're grabbing her arm."
431,00:28:07,00:28:08,It wasn't like that.
432,00:28:08,00:28:10,I just got my learner's permit.
433,00:28:10,00:28:12,My mom was waiting in the car.
434,00:28:12,00:28:14,We were just going to get slushies.
435,00:28:14,00:28:16,I saw Tessa in the parking lot.
436,00:28:16,00:28:17,"Hey, Tessa. Hey."
437,00:28:17,00:28:18,Henry.
438,00:28:18,00:28:20,"You want a ride, just door to door?"
439,00:28:20,00:28:22,"No, that's okay."
440,00:28:22,00:28:24,"Oh, come on. You're not scared to drive with me, are you?"
441,00:28:24,00:28:27,"No, it's okay. I got it."
442,00:28:27,00:28:29,She said she was getting a ride from someone else.
443,00:28:29,00:28:31,Did she say who?
444,00:28:32,00:28:33,No.
445,00:28:33,00:28:37,"But when we pulled away, I saw her getting into a truck."
446,00:28:37,00:28:39,I didn't see the driver.
447,00:28:44,00:28:46,I've got a question for you.
448,00:28:46,00:28:58,"What substance contains the following ingredients: Sorbitol, cetyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, glyceryl, stearate, PEG-100 stearate, petrolatum, benzylalcohol, titanium dioxide and purified water?"
449,00:28:58,00:29:03,"Okay, I assume that you've identified the substance we found on the roller coaster track?"
450,00:29:03,00:29:04,Correct.
451,00:29:05,00:29:07,It's doxepin ointment.
452,00:29:07,00:29:09,"(chuckles): Sounds Klingon, huh?"
453,00:29:11,00:29:19,"Anyway, uh, it's prescribed by doctors to treat dermatological inflammations caused by contact with certain types of plants."
454,00:29:19,00:29:23,Maybe whoever messed with the tracks transferred the ointment when they loosened the wheels.
455,00:29:25,00:29:26,(metallic clanking)
456,00:29:26,00:29:28,Your killer has a rash.
457,00:29:28,00:29:31,And we need to catch it.
458,00:29:35,00:29:37,I've been looking for you.
459,00:29:37,00:29:38,What's up?
460,00:29:38,00:29:41,Hodges analyzed the trace from inside Tessa's wound.
461,00:29:41,00:29:43,It seems it was ZooDoo.
462,00:29:43,00:29:44,Come again.
463,00:29:44,00:29:45,Hoof stock.
464,00:29:46,00:29:48,"It's a combination of feces from rhinos, zebras, and bison."
465,00:29:48,00:29:50,You're kidding?
466,00:29:50,00:29:53,They say that the smell of wild animal crap keeps the deer away.
467,00:29:53,00:29:55,Who knew?
468,00:29:55,00:29:57,"Uh, so can we track the source of...?"
469,00:29:58,00:30:01,There is a zoo in Auckland that exports it.
470,00:30:01,00:30:05,And there's only one landscaping company in Clark County that imports it-- ADL.
471,00:30:05,00:30:07,"I contacted ADL, and guess what they told me?"
472,00:30:07,00:30:12,"Couple of months back, they were hired by the victim's mother."
473,00:30:20,00:30:21,BROWN: Hmm.
474,00:30:21,00:30:22,ADL Landscaping.
475,00:30:22,00:30:23,(camera shutter clicks)
476,00:30:24,00:30:29,Must've been a big job-- she hired them months ago.
477,00:30:31,00:30:33,ZooDoo.
478,00:30:34,00:30:35,(camera shutter clicking)
479,00:30:41,00:30:43,Hello.
480,00:30:43,00:30:44,Hi.
481,00:30:45,00:30:46,I just left you a message.
482,00:30:46,00:30:48,Any news?
483,00:30:50,00:30:53,"Honey, these guys are from the crime lab."
484,00:30:53,00:30:54,"Justin Mack, my boyfriend."
485,00:30:55,00:30:57,How you doing?
486,00:30:57,00:30:58,BROWN: Hey.
487,00:30:58,00:31:00,Could I have a word with you outside for a moment?
488,00:31:00,00:31:01,Why?
489,00:31:01,00:31:02,Why not?
490,00:31:10,00:31:13,May I?
491,00:31:13,00:31:17,How can you be sure it was Justin's truck?
492,00:31:17,00:31:20,"At this point, we're just following a lead."
493,00:31:20,00:31:24,How long have you known Justin?
494,00:31:24,00:31:28,Uh... few months.
495,00:31:29,00:31:31,Hired him to lay sod.
496,00:31:31,00:31:34,Now we're in the midst of an outdoor overhaul.
497,00:31:34,00:31:37,And where's Tessa's father?
498,00:31:37,00:31:38,"L.A., maybe. I don't know."
499,00:31:39,00:31:41,I haven't heard from him since the divorce.
500,00:31:42,00:31:44,He'll find a way to blame me for this.
501,00:31:45,00:31:48,"You see, Raina said it was important for Tessa to take the bus to school."
502,00:31:48,00:31:50,Said it helps build independence.
503,00:31:50,00:31:56,"But sometimes I'd pick her up at the bus stop, buy her an ice-cream cone, and drop her off here."
504,00:31:56,00:31:58,Did you pick her up that afternoon?
505,00:31:58,00:32:03,"Look, I know there are a lot of whack-jobs in the world, and you're just doing your job, but watch it."
506,00:32:04,00:32:06,You mind if I take a look in the back of your truck?
507,00:32:07,00:32:10,Don't you need a warrant?
508,00:32:10,00:32:12,Only if you deny me access.
509,00:32:12,00:32:13,Go ahead.
510,00:32:13,00:32:15,Thanks.
511,00:32:15,00:32:18,Have you ever left Tessa alone with Justin?
512,00:32:18,00:32:19,Sure.
513,00:32:19,00:32:20,He's over here all the time.
514,00:32:21,00:32:24,He's a good man.
515,00:32:24,00:32:28,"He wouldn't hurt anybody, especially not Tessa."
516,00:32:30,00:32:35,"(voice cracks): Damn, I keep expecting her to walk through that door."
517,00:33:09,00:33:14,"In 1988, your client was arrested for a drunk and disorderly."
518,00:33:14,00:33:17,Your fingerprints were then entered into our database.
519,00:33:17,00:33:20,They match the fingerprints that we found on this shovel.
520,00:33:22,00:33:29,WILLOWS: The blood on the blade matches your daughter's DNA.
521,00:33:29,00:33:32,My client is landscaping her backyard with her boyfriend.
522,00:33:33,00:33:35,Explains her prints on his shovel.
523,00:33:35,00:33:38,They were the only prints on the shovel.
524,00:33:38,00:33:40,Justin wears work gloves.
525,00:33:40,00:33:43,Which explains the absence of his prints.
526,00:33:43,00:33:45,That's possible.
527,00:33:45,00:33:49,But your client's fingerprints provided a sufficient basis for a warrant to search her vehicle.
528,00:34:00,00:34:10,The choice of weapon and the manner of disposal suggest that this was not a premeditated murder.
529,00:34:14,00:34:16,You can help yourself here.
530,00:34:16,00:34:20,You can avoid Murder One by telling us what set you off.
531,00:34:22,00:34:24,You wouldn't understand.
532,00:34:24,00:34:26,Try me.
533,00:34:26,00:34:36,"I bought Tessa a bus pass, and that little slut still gets my guy to pick her up after school."
534,00:34:36,00:34:38,Raina... Shut up!
535,00:34:40,00:34:41,We all know why.
536,00:34:41,00:34:43,Why don't you tell us?
537,00:34:43,00:34:46,She was trying to steal him from me.
538,00:34:52,00:34:55,"Bye, thanks Justin."
539,00:34:57,00:35:00,What the hell were you doing with him?
540,00:35:00,00:35:02,"Mom, he just gave me a ride home."
541,00:35:02,00:35:04,You think you got him wrapped around your little finger?
542,00:35:04,00:35:05,"He's just being nice, okay?"
543,00:35:05,00:35:07,Were you nice back?
544,00:35:07,00:35:09,"Don't do this again, please!"
545,00:35:09,00:35:11,"You don't talk to me like that, you little bitch."
546,00:35:11,00:35:13,"Mom, you're being ridiculous."
547,00:35:13,00:35:19,Where the hell do you think you're going? I've given you everything.
548,00:35:23,00:35:26,Justin was the best thing in my life.
549,00:35:27,00:35:29,No.
550,00:35:29,00:35:35,Your daughter was the best thing in your life.
551,00:35:37,00:35:39,You didn't know her.
552,00:35:39,00:35:42,(scoffs)
553,00:35:42,00:35:44,I know she was 13 years old.
554,00:35:44,00:35:47,A child.
555,00:35:50,00:35:52,(sighs)
556,00:35:52,00:35:55,SIDLE: I just got the court order from the pharmaceutical database.
557,00:35:55,00:35:57,"Fortunately, Dioxipin isn't widely prescribed."
558,00:35:57,00:36:02,"FDA only approved it two years ago, and most dermatologists don't even know what it is."
559,00:36:02,00:36:04,How many names on the list?
560,00:36:04,00:36:07,"Well, in Clark County, twelve prescriptions were filled."
561,00:36:07,00:36:11,"I cross-referenced them with the employees from the Park, and I got a hit."
562,00:36:11,00:36:12,You want a clue?
563,00:36:12,00:36:18,"Her death ended the Ptolemy dynasty's reign in Ancient Egypt, hence making her the last Pharaoh."
564,00:36:18,00:36:21,"Ah, the lovely Cleopatra."
565,00:36:21,00:36:22,I had a rash.
566,00:36:22,00:36:24,So what?
567,00:36:24,00:36:25,That's not a crime.
568,00:36:25,00:36:26,I read the court order.
569,00:36:26,00:36:30,"Uh, you found trace amounts of some ointment on the roller coaster tracks?"
570,00:36:30,00:36:32,Is that the only reason for this conversation?
571,00:36:32,00:36:35,Your client had a prescription for doxepin.
572,00:36:38,00:36:40,"May we see your arms, please?"
573,00:36:40,00:36:41,Rash was on my legs.
574,00:36:41,00:36:43,Went away days ago.
575,00:36:43,00:36:44,You want to see?
576,00:36:45,00:36:46,"Uh, that's okay."
577,00:36:46,00:36:51,"Unless you want to argue that my client stood on her head and held a wrench in her toes, we're done here."
578,00:36:51,00:36:53,"Do you know how you contracted the rash, Lisa?"
579,00:36:53,00:36:57,"Best guess, I was getting some help with my homework."
580,00:36:57,00:36:59,We were studying outside on the grass.
581,00:36:59,00:37:01,"Took a break, went for a walk."
582,00:37:01,00:37:03,I think I brushed up against something.
583,00:37:03,00:37:05,Who's we?
584,00:37:05,00:37:06,My math tutor.
585,00:37:06,00:37:08,And what's his name?
586,00:37:08,00:37:10,Zack Lawrence.
587,00:37:14,00:37:16,"Do you know if he contracted the rash, as well?"
588,00:37:16,00:37:19,"Yeah. Actually, I gave him some of my ointment."
589,00:37:23,00:37:25,"BRASS: Hey, Zack."
590,00:37:25,00:37:28,"Oh, hey, guys."
591,00:37:28,00:37:29,We spoke with Lisa.
592,00:37:29,00:37:33,She said she gave you some ointment for some nasty rash you have.
593,00:37:33,00:37:36,"Yeah, yeah. SIDLE: You know, it's illegal to use someone else's prescription medications."
594,00:37:36,00:37:38,Is that why you guys are here?
595,00:37:38,00:37:40,Not exactly.
596,00:37:42,00:37:44,"Um, you guys mind if we talk about this somewhere else?"
597,00:37:45,00:37:45,"Hey, good idea."
598,00:37:46,00:37:47,Why don't we go downtown?
599,00:37:47,00:37:48,We can talk there.
600,00:37:48,00:37:50,Come on. Come on.
601,00:37:50,00:37:52,All right.
602,00:37:52,00:37:54,You coming?
603,00:37:54,00:37:57,"You know, I'm going to catch up."
604,00:37:57,00:37:58,Okay.
605,00:38:24,00:38:27,"Yeah, it's, uh, just a little bit of a rash."
606,00:38:27,00:38:29,It's really no big deal.
607,00:38:29,00:38:31,"Zack, what do you have against roller coasters?"
608,00:38:31,00:38:32,What do...?
609,00:38:32,00:38:34,I-I don't understand.
610,00:38:34,00:38:36,This a fingerprint analysis.
611,00:38:36,00:38:40,"Zack, I lifted some fingerprints off your broom back at the Park."
612,00:38:40,00:38:45,"Turns out, they're a match to prints that we lifted off of Jim Nevins' T-Bird and the wrench that was used to kill him."
613,00:38:45,00:38:47,Circumstantial evidence at best.
614,00:38:47,00:38:49,I also talked to your school principal.
615,00:38:49,00:38:51,"You're a straight ""A"" student, Mathalete."
616,00:38:51,00:38:52,Science Team.
617,00:38:52,00:38:54,You had a full ride to Stanford next year.
618,00:38:54,00:38:59,You don't sound like the kind of kid that would mess with a roller coaster just for kicks.
619,00:39:01,00:39:02,"GRISSOM: You're a smart guy, Zack."
620,00:39:02,00:39:04,"So, uh..."
621,00:39:04,00:39:08,"let's talk this out, logically."
622,00:39:08,00:39:17,"According to your previous statement, when you locked up on Thursday night, Jim Nevins' car was the only one in the parking lot, right?"
623,00:39:17,00:39:19,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
624,00:39:19,00:39:22,And you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster.
625,00:39:22,00:39:25,I don't care about Jim Nevins.
626,00:39:25,00:39:28,What about Lisa Hunt?
627,00:39:28,00:39:31,"You tutor her, right?"
628,00:39:31,00:39:33,Did Lisa tell you that she had a date with Jim?
629,00:39:33,00:39:35,"No, she didn't say anything."
630,00:39:35,00:39:37,It was all over the park.
631,00:39:37,00:39:41,Jim was going to take Lisa on one of his coaster dates.
632,00:39:42,00:39:43,I asked her about it.
633,00:39:44,00:39:45,She said it was a rumor.
634,00:39:45,00:39:49,It seems to matter to you that she had a date with Jim.
635,00:39:49,00:39:53,"Lady, I make $20 an hour tutoring."
636,00:39:53,00:39:56,Why do you think I'd take minimum wage at The Sphinx?
637,00:39:56,00:40:00,"I'm thinking, you want Lisa to see you away from the textbooks."
638,00:40:01,00:40:03,We started hanging out at breaks.
639,00:40:03,00:40:05,Having dinner.
640,00:40:07,00:40:10,"And then last week, after tutoring, we went for a walk."
641,00:40:10,00:40:13,And she grabbed my hand.
642,00:40:13,00:40:16,Did you think that meant something?
643,00:40:16,00:40:18,Of course.
644,00:40:18,00:40:20,But...
645,00:40:20,00:40:23,you didn't trust her.
646,00:40:24,00:40:26,No. I wanted to.
647,00:40:39,00:40:41,You tampered with the screws.
648,00:40:41,00:40:44,"If she wasn't lying, she wouldn't be on the roller coaster."
649,00:40:44,00:40:45,"No harm, no foul."
650,00:40:45,00:40:48,"Oh, but you see, she was lying."
651,00:40:48,00:40:49,Uh-huh.
652,00:40:51,00:40:53,"But you didn't loosen the wheels enough, did you?"
653,00:40:53,00:40:55,Don't answer that.
654,00:40:55,00:41:02,"So when the roller coaster didn't derail, you took things into your own hands."
655,00:41:12,00:41:14,Lisa walked home.
656,00:41:14,00:41:16,Jim walked over to his car.
657,00:41:22,00:41:26,What I don't understand is why you didn't go back and fix the roller coaster.
658,00:41:28,00:41:30,Guess I just didn't think about it.
659,00:41:30,00:41:32,SIDLE: You'll be thinking about it now.
660,00:41:33,00:41:35,And for the rest of your life.
661,00:41:37,00:41:40,(crowd chatter)
662,00:41:41,00:41:44,I should have caught those loose screws.
663,00:41:44,00:41:48,"Used to check 'em every morning, but since management cut back on my hours..."
664,00:41:48,00:41:50,"You're not to blame for this, Woody."
665,00:41:50,00:41:53,"Oh, I just hope they don't blame the coaster."
666,00:41:53,00:41:58,"It may not be the Manhattan Express at New York, New York or the Desperado in Primm, but it-it..."
667,00:41:58,00:42:00,It still makes grown men scream.
668,00:42:00,00:42:03,"My first week in Vegas, I road the Desperado."
669,00:42:03,00:42:05,My first coaster marathon.
670,00:42:05,00:42:07,I rode that monster for a week straight.
671,00:42:07,00:42:08,Hmm.
672,00:42:08,00:42:12,"The Steel Phantom, Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania-- I actually hold the marathon record there."
673,00:42:12,00:42:14,"Uh, uh."
674,00:42:14,00:42:17,"My-My favorite's still the, um, King's Island."
675,00:42:17,00:42:18,The Beast.
676,00:42:18,00:42:19,Mm.
677,00:42:19,00:42:24,I presented a paper at an Entomology convention in Cincinnati just so I could ride Son of Beast.
678,00:42:24,00:42:26,Head over heels on a wooden track.
679,00:42:26,00:42:29,"Ah. So, you prefer wood over steel?"
680,00:42:29,00:42:32,No. Not really.
681,00:42:32,00:42:34,"For me, it's not about the track."
682,00:42:34,00:42:37,It's about the thrill.
