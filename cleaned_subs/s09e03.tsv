0	00:01:11	00:01:12	(screams) Hey!
1	00:01:12	00:01:14	He's got my purse! Hey!
2	00:01:20	00:01:21	Call the cops, call 911.
3	00:01:21	00:01:23	My phone was in the purse.
4	00:01:25	00:01:28	Ma'am, excuse me, I need to use your phone.
5	00:01:28	00:01:32	Lady...
6	00:01:33	00:01:34	Lady?
7	00:01:44	00:01:45	I got here as fast as I could.
8	00:01:45	00:01:50	My DFO in Anthem took longer to clear than I expected, but that's what happens when you don't have enough bodies to cover the bodies.
9	00:01:58	00:02:00	Oh...
10	00:02:00	00:02:03	Uh...
11	00:02:03	00:02:04	she forget to fall down?
12	00:02:05	00:02:06	Lividity's fixed in her ankles and feet.
13	00:02:06	00:02:09	Suggests she died in this position.
14	00:02:14	00:02:18	I don't know if you saw the weather report last night, but there was dry lighting in this area.
15	00:02:20	00:02:22	A low voltage strike...
16	00:02:23	00:02:27	...could have caused her arm muscles to contract around the pole.
17	00:02:29	00:02:30	And then what?
18	00:02:30	00:02:38	Cadaveric spasms in her shoulder and hand keeps the body in position until rigor sets in?
19	00:02:39	00:02:42	It's just a theory. I'll tell Robbins to look for signs of electrocution.
20	00:02:42	00:02:44	Hi, guys.
21	00:02:44	00:02:46	The callout was a 419.
22	00:02:46	00:02:47	Where's the body?
23	00:02:48	00:02:50	Ask her.
24	00:02:51	00:02:54	Excuse me, ma'am.
25	00:02:55	00:02:56	Ma'am?
26	00:02:56	00:02:57	Hey...!
27	00:03:37	00:03:39	Nick can't help us.
28	00:03:39	00:03:42	He just got a call out at the Monte Carlo.
29	00:03:42	00:03:43	In other words, we're pulling another double.
30	00:03:44	00:03:45	Why should today be any different?
31	00:03:49	00:03:53	There's no burn marks on the arm or hand where she was touching the pole.
32	00:03:53	00:03:57	Well, there's no scoring or blackening on the dome, either.
33	00:03:57	00:03:59	No indication of a lightning strike.
34	00:04:01	00:04:04	The bulb's burned out.
35	00:04:04	00:04:05	Maybe there's a short in the wiring.
36	00:04:05	00:04:08	Liver temp's 98, but ambient's pushing a hundred.
37	00:04:08	00:04:11	So the body could have warmed up after death?
38	00:04:11	00:04:12	No T.O.D.
39	00:04:12	00:04:14	Sorry.
40	00:04:18	00:04:20	Rigor's starting to break.
41	00:04:20	00:04:22	I'll take her prints.
42	00:04:22	00:04:24	Her phone looks new.
43	00:04:24	00:04:26	Hasn't even been personalized yet.
44	00:04:26	00:04:28	Who was she talking to?
45	00:04:31	00:04:33	MovieFone.
46	00:04:33	00:04:36	She carrying I.D.?
47	00:04:38	00:04:40	She's not carrying anything.
48	00:04:40	00:04:44	Well, if someone was going to rob her, why not take the whole purse?
49	00:04:44	00:04:47	Why waste time emptying the contents?
50	00:04:47	00:04:52	So, lucky us-- the lamppost lady's fingerprints are in the system.
51	00:04:52	00:04:53	She has a record?
52	00:04:53	00:04:54	It's not that system.
53	00:04:54	00:04:57	It's the health care providers database.
54	00:04:57	00:04:58	Name's Carla Peretti.
55	00:04:58	00:05:00	She's an LPN at Desert Palm.
56	00:05:00	00:05:01	Captain Brass is running background.
57	00:05:01	00:05:02	Good.
58	00:05:02	00:05:03	Where is everyone?
59	00:05:03	00:05:04	They're in the break room waiting.
60	00:05:04	00:05:06	Waiting for what?
61	00:05:06	00:05:08	For you.
62	00:05:08	00:05:11	I know you got the memo; I put it on your desk.
63	00:05:13	00:05:14	My name's Patricia Alwick.
64	00:05:14	00:05:18	I'm a peer counselor for the Police Employees Assistance Program.
65	00:05:18	00:05:23	I deal primarily with law enforcement, which means I know that none of you wants to listen to me, so I'll keep it short.
66	00:05:23	00:05:28	With the death of Warrick Brown, you've lost a colleague and a friend.
67	00:05:28	00:05:30	I'm here to help you through it.
68	00:05:30	00:05:33	Our conversations will be informal and confidential.
69	00:05:34	00:05:36	Are the sessions mandatory? No.
70	00:05:36	00:05:39	No, they're not, but keep this in mind.
71	00:05:39	00:05:47	Right now, you might feel okay and that you can handle things fine on your own, but sometimes, if you're not looking, grief can sneak up and bite you.
72	00:05:47	00:05:48	I've been doing this a long time.
73	00:05:48	00:05:49	I know what I'm talking about.
74	00:05:49	00:05:52	Ms. Alwick will be up in room 4-E.
75	00:05:52	00:05:57	If you'd like to make an appointment, call her at extension 2922.
76	00:05:57	00:05:59	All right, guys, we're done.
77	00:05:59	00:06:01	Thanks for coming.
78	00:06:05	00:06:07	What, no gun?
79	00:06:07	00:06:09	Sorry.
80	00:06:10	00:06:12	Well, maybe later, then.
81	00:06:12	00:06:14	Thanks.
82	00:06:45	00:06:47	Hello.
83	00:06:47	00:06:50	Hi.
84	00:06:51	00:06:52	Would you like to make an appointment?
85	00:06:53	00:06:55	No.
86	00:06:55	00:06:57	I'm new here.
87	00:06:57	00:06:59	Hence the new guy manuals.
88	00:06:59	00:07:01	Excuse me.
89	00:07:05	00:07:12	You know, joining an established team, particularly under these circumstances-- it's not going to be easy for you.
90	00:07:12	00:07:15	Do you think I should quit?
91	00:07:15	00:07:18	It may not be easy on your colleagues, either.
92	00:07:18	00:07:19	Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
93	00:07:19	00:07:20	Of course there is.
94	00:07:20	00:07:22	I'm happy to discuss...
95	00:07:22	00:07:24	Look, I'm-- this is day one.
96	00:07:24	00:07:27	I don't know these people, they don't know me.
97	00:07:27	00:07:30	It's going to work out however it works out.
98	00:07:30	00:07:31	Uh-huh.
99	00:07:31	00:07:33	You seem a bit defensive.
100	00:07:35	00:07:36	Don't do that, okay?
101	00:07:36	00:07:38	Do what? You seem a bit defensive.
102	00:07:38	00:07:39	Both my parents are shrinks.
103	00:07:39	00:07:41	I don't do the talk.
104	00:07:41	00:07:44	Both your parents are psychiatrists.
105	00:07:44	00:07:46	Interesting. Interesting.
106	00:07:47	00:07:48	Are you Riley Adams?
107	00:07:48	00:07:50	Yeah, that's me.
108	00:07:50	00:07:51	I'm Gil Grissom, your supervisor.
109	00:07:51	00:07:52	We're very busy.
110	00:07:52	00:07:53	Would you come with me, please?
111	00:07:53	00:07:56	Yeah.
112	00:07:56	00:07:57	Good luck.
113	00:08:20	00:08:22	Another transit patron called it in.
114	00:08:22	00:08:30	He was pissed the guy was taking up the whole bench, so he tried to shove him over, which didn't work too well, him being dead at the time.
115	00:08:30	00:08:32	Hey, everybody.
116	00:08:32	00:08:33	Oh, hi, I'm David.
117	00:08:33	00:08:35	Riley.
118	00:08:35	00:08:38	He's all yours.
119	00:08:41	00:08:43	No wallet.
120	00:08:43	00:08:45	No cash or keys either.
121	00:08:47	00:08:48	Body's in full rigor.
122	00:08:48	00:08:49	Roll him.
123	00:08:56	00:08:59	I saw that...
124	00:08:59	00:09:01	and I'm not ever going to forget it.
125	00:09:10	00:09:12	What does lividity tell you?
126	00:09:12	00:09:15	That he was lying here when he died.
127	00:09:15	00:09:17	How do you know that? 'Cause I'm a CSI level two.
128	00:09:17	00:09:21	And this is part of your proficiency evaluation.
129	00:09:21	00:09:23	Yeah, but it's pass-fail.
130	00:09:25	00:09:28	Lividity's fixed along the posterior aspect.
131	00:09:28	00:09:31	Pressure marks are consistent with the bench slats.
132	00:09:31	00:09:33	Do we know how long he's been here?
133	00:09:33	00:09:38	Bus driver's certain the guy wasn't here an hour and a half ago when he made his previous stop.
134	00:09:38	00:09:40	You see any problem with that?
135	00:09:40	00:09:43	Yeah, full rigor takes 12 to 24 hours to set.
136	00:09:44	00:09:49	And if he's been here less than 90 minutes, how does he end up in full rigor?
137	00:09:49	00:09:51	Well, he looks like he was on a run.
138	00:09:51	00:09:54	Maybe he had a heart attack and went into spontaneous rigor.
139	00:09:55	00:10:01	Intense physical activity rapidly depletes muscle fibers of ATP, which gives them the energy they need to contract.
140	00:10:01	00:10:06	If there's not enough ATP at the time of death, the muscles can lock up and immediately go into rigor.
141	00:10:08	00:10:10	What's bugging you?
142	00:10:10	00:10:15	This is the second case of rapid-onset rigor mortis we've had in the last 24 hours.
143	00:10:15	00:10:16	That's pretty weird.
144	00:10:16	00:10:18	Even for Vegas.
145	00:10:18	00:10:20	Brass checked Carla Peretti's apartment.
146	00:10:20	00:10:22	No forced entry or any signs of disturbance.
147	00:10:22	00:10:26	She was last seen alive leaving Desert Palm Hospital at the end of her shift.
148	00:10:26	00:10:27	Anybody know where she was going?
149	00:10:27	00:10:29	Well, apparently, it could have been a lot of places.
150	00:10:29	00:10:34	She was working a bunch of jobs on the side-- model, club dancer, convention booth babe.
151	00:10:34	00:10:36	You know, typical Vegas pretty girl stuff.
152	00:10:37	00:10:38	Mm-hmm.
153	00:10:38	00:10:39	Autopsy report.
154	00:10:40	00:10:41	cardiac arrest.
155	00:10:41	00:10:45	That's coroner speak for I can't explain what killed her. Yeah.
156	00:10:45	00:10:50	No signs of conductivity burns, no evidence of nuclear streaming in the tissue.
157	00:10:51	00:10:53	There's no indications of electrocution whatsoever.
158	00:10:53	00:10:55	There's other ways for the muscles to seize up.
159	00:10:55	00:10:56	You know, maybe she was epileptic.
160	00:10:56	00:11:00	Mm, sorry, no epilepsy drugs in her system.
161	00:11:00	00:11:02	People go off their meds all the time.
162	00:11:02	00:11:03	That's how they get seizures.
163	00:11:03	00:11:05	Uh, she had no medical history of epilepsy.
164	00:11:05	00:11:08	But the disease doesn't leave any physical record in the body.
165	00:11:08	00:11:10	The tox panel ruled out poisons and O.D.'s.
166	00:11:10	00:11:15	She had a small amount of zolpidem in her system, but that stuff's in most over-the-counter sleep aids these days.
167	00:11:15	00:11:16	It's nothing that would kill her.
168	00:11:16	00:11:19	No organ damage.
169	00:11:19	00:11:21	No disease, no trauma.
170	00:11:21	00:11:25	This was a perfectly healthy young woman.
171	00:11:25	00:11:28	Yeah, till she dropped dead... without dropping.
172	00:11:39	00:11:44	Well, I always thought it was cool that teeth fluoresced, but veneers didn't.
173	00:11:44	00:11:45	How'd you get them?
174	00:11:45	00:11:50	Somebody bet me that I couldn't jump into a lake with a rope swing in my mouth.
175	00:11:50	00:11:51	And that pulled the teeth out?
176	00:11:51	00:11:52	No.
177	00:11:53	00:11:55	But it sure did hurt my neck.
178	00:11:55	00:11:57	On the way home, I hit a fire hydrant.
179	00:11:57	00:11:59	And you bumped the steering wheel with your mouth.
180	00:11:59	00:12:02	No, I was on my bike at the time.
181	00:12:02	00:12:06	I flew over the hydrant and smashed into the crossbar of a chain link fence.
182	00:12:06	00:12:06	With your mouth.
183	00:12:07	00:12:08	My shoulder.
184	00:12:08	00:12:09	Broke my clavicle.
185	00:12:09	00:12:11	Okay, then how'd you lose the teeth?
186	00:12:11	00:12:14	This one was a root canal.
187	00:12:14	00:12:16	This one, a post and a crown.
188	00:12:17	00:12:19	And this one-- I, uh...
189	00:12:19	00:12:20	I was in college.
190	00:12:20	00:12:22	I woke up one morning, and it was gone.
191	00:12:22	00:12:23	I don't know what happened to it.
192	00:12:23	00:12:25	Al Robbins.
193	00:12:25	00:12:26	Riley Adams.
194	00:12:26	00:12:28	Pardon the latex.
195	00:12:28	00:12:30	Okay.
196	00:12:30	00:12:31	What do we got?
197	00:12:32	00:12:34	Uh, somebody who liked to party.
198	00:12:34	00:12:39	Prelim tox showed traces of meth, E and heroin in his system.
199	00:12:39	00:12:41	Doesn't sound like someone who would go for a run at midnight.
200	00:12:41	00:12:45	I doubt this guy could've run a hundred feet without stopping to rest.
201	00:12:45	00:12:46	He had pulmonary edema.
202	00:12:46	00:12:48	Fluid's backed up in the lungs.
203	00:12:48	00:12:50	Sometimes suggests drug abuse.
204	00:12:50	00:12:51	Is that C.O.D.?
205	00:12:51	00:12:54	I doubt it. The edema wasn't acute.
206	00:12:54	00:12:56	Far as I can tell, C.O.D. is cardiac arrest.
207	00:12:56	00:12:58	Same as the lady in the park.
208	00:12:58	00:13:01	Yeah, which brings us to something interesting.
209	00:13:02	00:13:03	The victim's liver.
210	00:13:03	00:13:07	Note the slight reddish and pinkish coloration.
211	00:13:07	00:13:10	Very similar to Carla Peretti.
212	00:13:10	00:13:16	Assuming the cases are connected, the condition of the victims' livers might suggest an alternate C.O.D.
213	00:13:17	00:13:18	Gaseous asphyxiation.
214	00:13:18	00:13:22	I'll have Hodges do a blood gas assay.
215	00:13:48	00:13:52	We walked the photo of the jogger around the local methadone clinic and got lucky.
216	00:13:52	00:13:54	Name's Harley Soon.
217	00:13:54	00:13:55	He has a sheet.
218	00:13:55	00:13:58	Drug abuse, solicitation, some other petty stuff.
219	00:13:58	00:14:00	Juvie record, too, but that's sealed.
220	00:14:00	00:14:02	Thank you, Detective.
221	00:14:02	00:14:03	No problem.
222	00:14:12	00:14:14	You doing a headspace assay?
223	00:14:14	00:14:17	Yes, which is, I believe, your job.
224	00:14:17	00:14:19	Where have you been?
225	00:14:19	00:14:21	I was just, uh... nowhere.
226	00:14:21	00:14:24	You want me to finish up?
227	00:14:24	00:14:26	I'm almost done.
228	00:14:33	00:14:35	Um...
229	00:14:35	00:14:37	hold on a second.
230	00:14:37	00:14:39	What?
231	00:14:39	00:14:41	You added the liberating agent.
232	00:14:41	00:14:43	Yes.
233	00:14:43	00:14:45	You added the sulfuric.
234	00:14:45	00:14:48	You skipped over the sodium dithionite?
235	00:14:48	00:14:51	Yes, I think I did.
236	00:14:54	00:14:58	I think I must have done it with all of these.
237	00:14:58	00:15:00	It's probably better to redo the whole assay.
238	00:15:00	00:15:03	Um, listen, I can get it.
239	00:15:03	00:15:05	Should have been doing it to begin with.
240	00:15:06	00:15:08	Don't worry about it.
241	00:15:08	00:15:10	I know it's been a long day.
242	00:15:10	00:15:11	Every day's a long day.
243	00:15:19	00:15:20	(snaps phone shut) I have to go.
244	00:15:21	00:15:23	Thank you.
245	00:15:28	00:15:32	5 if you know what I'm saying.
246	00:15:32	00:15:34	I don't care how nicely dressed they are.
247	00:15:34	00:15:36	Hey, hey, hey, that's illegal.
248	00:15:36	00:15:42	Yeah, which is why I stopped and told him to hop in, but he just stood there like that, stock still.
249	00:15:42	00:15:44	Creeped me out, I don't mind telling you.
250	00:15:44	00:15:46	You're gonna love this.
251	00:15:46	00:15:47	Uh...
252	00:15:59	00:16:05	I've heard of dying with your boots on, but, uh, this is ridiculous.
253	00:16:18	00:16:20	Businessman with an empty briefcase.
254	00:16:20	00:16:22	No wallet or I.D.
255	00:16:22	00:16:23	Consistent with the other vics.
256	00:16:23	00:16:28	We got a serial killer, Greg, and he's working at a pace of one body per day.
257	00:16:28	00:16:31	Great. Something to look forward to tomorrow.
258	00:16:33	00:16:35	Damn! This thing is heavy.
259	00:16:39	00:16:42	He's got lead in the sole of his shoe.
260	00:16:42	00:16:45	Must be what was keeping him on his feet.
261	00:16:49	00:16:51	There's a coating of dust on here.
262	00:16:52	00:16:57	His fingernails have been recently trimmed, but they're filthy at the beds.
263	00:16:57	00:16:59	And he's got dirt in his ears.
264	00:16:59	00:17:05	His feet and ankles are all scabbed and crusty and his toenails are growing back into his toes.
265	00:17:05	00:17:08	This guy's been cleaned up, but I'll bet you he lived on the street.
266	00:17:17	00:17:19	Yep. Head lice.
267	00:17:19	00:17:22	They're all dead.
268	00:17:22	00:17:25	Good. I hate those little bastards.
269	00:17:26	00:17:28	So we've got three victims, all stripped of their identities.
270	00:17:29	00:17:35	A homeless guy dressed like a businessman, a hustler druggie dressed like a runner, and a nurse...
271	00:17:35	00:17:37	dressed like herself.
272	00:17:37	00:17:39	What do they have in common?
273	00:17:41	00:17:43	Tox found traces of zolpidem in all three.
274	00:17:43	00:17:50	Other than that, we're comparing all the trace evidence from the victims' clothing and personal effects, but so far, nothing probative.
275	00:17:50	00:17:57	PD is circulating photos of the businessman around shelters and soup kitchens in the area, but there's no I.D. yet.
276	00:17:57	00:17:59	This girl's an LPN.
277	00:17:59	00:18:01	Maybe her hospital's the connection.
278	00:18:01	00:18:06	According to Harley Soon's medical records, he was never treated at Desert Palm.
279	00:18:06	00:18:09	Well, Carla Peretti is the one victim who had a mainstream life.
280	00:18:09	00:18:10	That means e-mails, phone calls, documents.
281	00:18:10	00:18:15	If there's anything that connects these people, the way to find it is through her.
282	00:18:27	00:18:30	Looks like she was an art student.
283	00:18:41	00:18:44	Ah...
284	00:18:44	00:18:46	The naughty drawer.
285	00:18:46	00:18:47	What?
286	00:18:50	00:18:56	Hydroponic, medical grade, put-you-on-your-ass, send-you-to-dreamyland weed.
287	00:18:56	00:18:58	Nurses always get the good stuff.
288	00:18:58	00:18:59	Uh...
289	00:18:59	00:19:03	take it you're aware of the lab's random drug testing policy?
290	00:19:04	00:19:05	Oh, yeah.
291	00:19:05	00:19:09	I've got a bottle of clean urine in my locker, just in case.
292	00:19:09	00:19:11	I'm kidding.
293	00:19:13	00:19:15	Good one.
294	00:19:15	00:19:18	Here, I'll bag it.
295	00:19:26	00:19:28	Check this out.
296	00:19:28	00:19:30	An original of Carla.
297	00:19:30	00:19:33	Bizarre. She looks kind of...
298	00:19:33	00:19:34	Dead?
299	00:19:34	00:19:35	Yeah, a little.
300	00:19:35	00:19:37	What's that say?
301	00:19:37	00:19:40	J... Skaggs?
302	00:19:40	00:19:42	Never heard of him. Me, neither.
303	00:19:42	00:19:45	I bet somebody has.
304	00:19:51	00:19:54	What do you know.
305	00:19:54	00:19:56	He's a local.
306	00:20:10	00:20:12	Hey!
307	00:20:12	00:20:14	Jerzey Skaggs?
308	00:20:14	00:20:16	Jerzey? Skaggs?
309	00:20:16	00:20:19	Hey! Jerzey Skaggs?
310	00:20:19	00:20:21	Who are you?
311	00:20:21	00:20:23	Homicide.
312	00:20:23	00:20:26	This might look good in my living room.
313	00:20:26	00:20:28	You can't afford it.
314	00:20:28	00:20:30	Your arm down, and wake up.
315	00:20:30	00:20:31	Wake up!
316	00:20:35	00:20:36	What do you want?
317	00:20:36	00:20:37	Do you know Carla Peretti?
318	00:20:38	00:20:39	Who?
319	00:20:39	00:20:40	Carla Peretti.
320	00:20:40	00:20:44	Oh, yeah... yeah, she was one of my models.
321	00:20:44	00:20:46	She's a lovely girl.
322	00:20:46	00:20:47	It's a cheap imitation of my work.
323	00:20:47	00:20:52	Well, you'll have to take it up with the coroner, because she's dead for real.
324	00:20:53	00:20:55	I'm sorry to hear that.
325	00:20:55	00:20:57	You paint these guys?
326	00:20:57	00:21:00	No. Never saw those guys before in my life.
327	00:21:06	00:21:11	You know, Harley Soon used to crash at a buddy's apartment in the neighborhood.
328	00:21:11	00:21:13	Relax.
329	00:21:15	00:21:17	And he seems to be kind of your type.
330	00:21:17	00:21:23	Huh? So maybe you, uh... maybe you bumped into him at the grocery store or something.
331	00:21:24	00:21:25	I don't go out.
332	00:21:25	00:21:26	I don't shop.
333	00:21:26	00:21:28	I don't bump.
334	00:21:29	00:21:30	But you do paint dead people.
335	00:21:30	00:21:35	I paint people who look dead, and you would weep if you knew how much I make doing that.
336	00:21:35	00:21:40	If you haven't noticed, our culture seems to be obsessed with sex and death.
337	00:21:40	00:21:41	I've noticed.
338	00:21:41	00:21:45	Let me save you some time, 'cause I know what's on your mind.
339	00:21:45	00:21:46	I don't kill my models.
340	00:21:46	00:21:48	I don't even bang them much anymore.
341	00:21:48	00:21:50	Occasionally, of course, but...
342	00:21:50	00:21:56	oh, I find not with the same gusto and verve as in days gone by.
343	00:21:56	00:21:57	You bang Carla Peretti?
344	00:21:58	00:22:00	I'm not doing women.
345	00:22:00	00:22:03	Mind if I look around?
346	00:22:03	00:22:07	I'd like to paint you nude.
347	00:22:07	00:22:09	I don't do nude.
348	00:22:09	00:22:11	Where would I pin the badge?
349	00:22:11	00:22:13	Exactly.
350	00:22:29	00:22:31	Ms. Alwick.
351	00:22:31	00:22:32	Dr. Grissom.
352	00:22:32	00:22:33	Were you looking for me?
353	00:22:33	00:22:36	No, just getting some more tea.
354	00:22:36	00:22:38	I was hoping we might get a chance to chat.
355	00:22:38	00:22:40	I'm right in the middle of a case.
356	00:22:40	00:22:45	I know, I understand that you're dealing with a lot, but, um, if you do find the time...
357	00:22:45	00:22:48	Thank you, I appreciate that.
358	00:22:51	00:22:56	This, uh, may be outside your field of expertise, but...
359	00:22:56	00:22:59	lately, I've been having some problems with Hank.
360	00:22:59	00:23:01	Grissom.
361	00:23:01	00:23:02	Oh, hi, Patricia.
362	00:23:02	00:23:04	Nice to see you again, David.
363	00:23:05	00:23:12	The headspace assay came back and showed levels of carbon monoxide in all the vics, as well as the dead lice on the businessman's head.
364	00:23:12	00:23:14	Excuse me.
365	00:23:16	00:23:20	Mostly simple hydrocarbons and sulfur dioxide, along with the carbon monoxide.
366	00:23:21	00:23:22	That's consistent with gasoline engine exhaust.
367	00:23:22	00:23:31	Yeah, and since the lice on the homeless guy died, it suggests that he was completely surrounded by exhaust fumes, not suffocated with a mask or a tube.
368	00:23:31	00:23:35	Or locked in a sealed car, for that matter-- there wouldn't have been enough room to pose them.
369	00:23:35	00:23:41	Lividity says the victims died in the positions in which they were discovered.
370	00:23:42	00:23:44	So, what does that mean, that the killer is using some sort of gas chamber?
371	00:23:44	00:23:46	I think so.
372	00:23:46	00:23:56	He lures someone back to his place, slips them a sedative, then redresses and positions the bodies inside a sealed container.
373	00:23:56	00:23:59	Waits for the carbon monoxide to go to work.
374	00:23:59	00:24:05	Once the bodies are in full rigor, he's got about ten hours to place them and have them discovered.
375	00:24:06	00:24:08	Now that we know the recipe, let's find the cook.
376	00:24:23	00:24:24	Hey...
377	00:24:24	00:24:30	I believe I just sighted Aeronautes saxatalis.
378	00:24:30	00:24:35	Aeronautes saxatalis, the white-throated swift.
379	00:24:35	00:24:37	They hardly ever range this far south this time of year.
380	00:24:43	00:24:45	The elderly couple was suffering from Alzheimer's.
381	00:24:46	00:24:50	They were on a little field trip from their assisted care facility day before yesterday.
382	00:24:50	00:24:53	Staff didn't even realize they were missing till bed check.
383	00:24:53	00:24:56	What, no surveillance cameras on the bird-watching path?
384	00:24:56	00:25:04	No, but the unis did turn up a crackhead who said he saw an average-height white male in a white panel van near the trail, about an hour before dawn.
385	00:25:04	00:25:17	Caught in their quotidian routines, these haunting figures, frozen in time, seem to mock the mundane blandness that screams silently beneath the sizzle of Sin City.
386	00:25:17	00:25:19	What is this?
387	00:25:19	00:25:20	Local art blog.
388	00:25:20	00:25:22	Our psycho is the hot topic.
389	00:25:22	00:25:24	They call him the Mannekiller.
390	00:25:24	00:25:32	...perhaps, finally, by using the flesh of human beings to replicate the flesh of human beings...
391	00:25:32	00:25:39	this madman who moves silently among us has crossed art's final frontier.
392	00:25:39	00:25:43	This is Langston Weller, signing off from mindscanvas.com.
393	00:25:43	00:25:44	This site's been getting hammered.
394	00:25:45	00:25:46	Check out the comments.
395	00:25:46	00:25:49	You're a one-man argument against free speech.
396	00:25:49	00:25:54	This is murder, pure and simple, and you're a moron.
397	00:25:54	00:25:56	Hitler was right-- kill the artists first.
398	00:25:56	00:25:59	At least nobody's buying this crap.
399	00:25:59	00:26:04	Vibrant images of life culled from the raw stuff of death.
400	00:26:04	00:26:07	These are works of art.
401	00:26:09	00:26:11	Apparently, there are some who share this aesthetic.
402	00:26:14	00:26:19	The dust found inside the businessman's shoes was actually undyed jute fibers.
403	00:26:19	00:26:22	The same fibers were also found on tape lifts from the other vic's clothes.
404	00:26:23	00:26:30	Killer's probably covering his vics in woven jute-- i.e., burlap-- at some point during the process.
405	00:26:30	00:26:31	Thanks, Greg.
406	00:26:31	00:26:33	You bet.
407	00:26:35	00:26:38	Dr. Grissom, may I have a word with you?
408	00:26:38	00:26:40	Yes, of course.
409	00:26:40	00:26:41	Come in.
410	00:26:41	00:26:45	I wonder why it is that you hold what I do in such obvious contempt.
411	00:26:46	00:26:48	Excuse me?
412	00:26:48	00:26:51	The last time we spoke, you mentioned that you were having problems with Hank.
413	00:26:51	00:26:56	Now, out of concern for you and because I take my job very seriously, I started asking around.
414	00:26:56	00:27:07	Oh... And was met by a mixture of bafflement and smirks by most of your staff, until David Hodges took pity on me and informed me that Hank was your dog.
415	00:27:07	00:27:08	I apologize.
416	00:27:08	00:27:10	It was a serious question.
417	00:27:10	00:27:11	Oh, really?
418	00:27:11	00:27:16	For the last few weeks, my dog's been listless.
419	00:27:16	00:27:19	Barely eats.
420	00:27:19	00:27:27	And I just, uh, wondered if you thought it was possible that pets could take on the emotions of their owners.
421	00:27:29	00:27:32	Well...
422	00:27:32	00:27:36	companion animals were bred to respond to human beings.
423	00:27:36	00:27:44	At some level, I do believe that they resonate with what their owners are feeling.
424	00:27:44	00:27:47	So, what are you feeling?
425	00:27:50	00:27:56	I've just been... a little distracted lately.
426	00:27:56	00:28:00	Uh, having a hard time focusing on the details.
427	00:28:00	00:28:01	That's normal.
428	00:28:01	00:28:03	Not for me.
429	00:28:09	00:28:14	I wondered, uh, if you knew, typically, how long this lasts.
430	00:28:14	00:28:16	There's no typical.
431	00:28:16	00:28:19	Days, weeks, sometimes years.
432	00:28:19	00:28:22	The important thing is to acknowledge it.
433	00:28:22	00:28:25	But you do have to talk about it.
434	00:28:26	00:28:29	And if not with me, then with somebody else.
435	00:28:29	00:28:32	And soon.
436	00:28:37	00:28:39	Jim, got something?
437	00:28:39	00:28:41	Yeah, Harley Soon's juvie record.
438	00:28:41	00:28:43	I got the court administrator to unseal it.
439	00:28:43	00:28:49	He was arrested five years ago in a drug raid on a party at the art studio of Jerzy Skaggs.
440	00:28:50	00:28:53	So, how do you like my studio?
441	00:28:53	00:28:54	This is ridiculous.
442	00:28:55	00:28:58	No, what's ridiculous is you denying that you knew Harley Soon.
443	00:28:59	00:29:00	What?
444	00:29:00	00:29:01	Party was five years ago.
445	00:29:01	00:29:03	The kid was 16 at the time.
446	00:29:03	00:29:04	You should have been busted for that, too.
447	00:29:04	00:29:09	Listen to me-- everybody who was anybody came to my parties.
448	00:29:09	00:29:13	And many like yourself, who are nobody at all.
449	00:29:13	00:29:14	You know, I just...
450	00:29:15	00:29:18	I can't remember everybody who came to my parties.
451	00:29:18	00:29:22	All right, so you reconnected with Harley Soon...
452	00:29:22	00:29:24	and you're connected with Carla Peretti.
453	00:29:24	00:29:27	A lot of people you know are turning up dead.
454	00:29:27	00:29:30	You're telling me these are actual dead people?
455	00:29:30	00:29:32	Come on, it's been all over the news.
456	00:29:32	00:29:35	I don't... I don't watch TV.
457	00:29:35	00:29:38	And I only use the Internet to make money.
458	00:29:38	00:29:40	Man, that is wild.
459	00:29:40	00:29:43	Death just mocking life.
460	00:29:48	00:29:49	Are you done?
461	00:29:49	00:29:51	You know, these look familiar.
462	00:29:51	00:29:53	Yeah, I bet they do.
463	00:29:53	00:29:55	No, no, no, no, not the...
464	00:29:55	00:29:56	not the people, the poses.
465	00:29:56	00:30:02	Somebody... somebody showed me drawings like these, months ago.
466	00:30:04	00:30:07	These people remind me of those wretched sketches.
467	00:30:08	00:30:10	Excuse me, Mr. Skaggs.
468	00:30:10	00:30:14	If I could have a moment, would you mind taking a quick look at these?
469	00:30:19	00:30:22	Uh-uh... uh-uh.
470	00:30:22	00:30:25	I can't stand looking at inferior art.
471	00:30:25	00:30:26	It just...
472	00:30:26	00:30:30	it sears into my consciousness like bad Mexican food.
473	00:30:30	00:30:32	Who was he?
474	00:30:32	00:30:39	No, I don't remember, but he was, you know, babbling about some insipid municipal sculpture...
475	00:30:39	00:30:41	competition he was hoping to win.
476	00:30:41	00:30:44	Open... to the public.
477	00:30:44	00:30:45	Oh, okay, so he was an artist.
478	00:30:45	00:30:51	No, he was some kind of contractor, subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, sub-sub-subcontractor.
479	00:30:51	00:30:54	I think my... my studio was, uh, being renovated, and it was...
480	00:30:55	00:30:56	you know, it was a big job.
481	00:30:56	00:30:57	There was lots of... lots of manual...
482	00:30:57	00:30:59	labor involved.
483	00:30:59	00:31:00	I need a name.
484	00:31:00	00:31:02	He was a laborer-- why would I know his name?
485	00:31:02	00:31:03	Because you hired him.
486	00:31:03	00:31:05	I didn't hire him.
487	00:31:05	00:31:08	One of those contractors hired him.
488	00:31:08	00:31:10	And no, I don't remember his name.
489	00:31:10	00:31:12	I... I barely remember your name.
490	00:31:12	00:31:14	What is your name?
491	00:31:15	00:31:21	Eight months ago, the city sponsored a competition to create a series of bronze lifelike statues for its parks and public spaces.
492	00:31:21	00:31:24	for the rest of your life.
493	00:31:24	00:31:26	Yeah, and all the applications were submitted digitally.
494	00:31:26	00:31:28	This is what the Parks Department sent over.
495	00:31:28	00:31:30	Hey, take a look at this one.
496	00:31:30	00:31:33	It's a submission from an Arthur Blisterman.
497	00:31:33	00:31:34	Look at this.
498	00:31:34	00:31:36	Jackpot, huh?
499	00:31:37	00:31:38	The rules stated that...
500	00:31:38	00:31:44	the sculpture should recreate the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity that make the city so vibrant and alive.
501	00:31:44	00:31:46	This guy was following them to the letter.
502	00:31:47	00:31:50	Yeah, except that he was substituting bronze with human flesh.
503	00:31:50	00:31:52	Guys, there's a, uh, sculpture number six here.
504	00:31:53	00:31:54	We only found five bodies.
505	00:31:54	00:31:56	Oh, God.
506	00:31:56	00:31:58	He's not done.
507	00:32:00	00:32:02	So, we got Blisterman's house staked out.
508	00:32:02	00:32:04	The neighbors haven't seen him for weeks.
509	00:32:04	00:32:06	Now, the guy's unmarried, got no criminal record.
510	00:32:06	00:32:09	He's an independent plumbing contractor, so he makes his own schedule, and he's not answering his phone.
511	00:32:09	00:32:11	No, he has a white panel van.
512	00:32:11	00:32:12	We got a broadcast out.
513	00:32:12	00:32:16	He's got to have some kind of work space or studio, somewhere he can come and go unnoticed.
514	00:32:16	00:32:18	Look, there's nothing on record.
515	00:32:18	00:32:22	We've released a picture, we've notified the schools and Child Services to be on alert.
516	00:32:22	00:32:24	Right now, that's all we can do.
517	00:32:25	00:32:29	Why do you think people make art?
518	00:32:29	00:32:31	Self-expression.
519	00:32:31	00:32:34	Yeah, but I think also to...
520	00:32:34	00:32:37	provoke or elicit a reaction.
521	00:32:38	00:32:41	Maybe the killer's into the controversy of it.
522	00:32:41	00:32:43	I think one of these blog posters might be our guy.
523	00:32:43	00:32:45	Maybe.
524	00:32:46	00:32:47	Click on that photo link.
525	00:32:52	00:32:53	What?
526	00:32:53	00:32:55	There's no yellow tape.
527	00:32:55	00:32:57	No bystanders. No crime scene.
528	00:32:57	00:32:59	Let me the check the metadata.
529	00:33:01	00:33:05	49 a.m.
530	00:33:05	00:33:07	00.
531	00:33:07	00:33:11	I guess our artist couldn't resist a snapshot of his first installation.
532	00:33:11	00:33:13	Anonymous is Blisterman.
533	00:33:13	00:33:15	How much trouble am I in?
534	00:33:15	00:33:16	Well, that remains to be seen.
535	00:33:16	00:33:20	But the way I see it, you encouraged a serial killer to kill on your blog.
536	00:33:20	00:33:22	I did no such thing.
537	00:33:22	00:33:23	Did I?
538	00:33:23	00:33:25	We'll leave that up to a jury of your peers.
539	00:33:25	00:33:27	I swear to God, I didn't want to hurt anybody.
540	00:33:27	00:33:29	I didn't do anything. Except shooting your mouth off.
541	00:33:29	00:33:33	Sometimes that's all it takes. Look, right now, you're going to do exactly what I tell you to.
542	00:33:33	00:33:34	Of course.
543	00:33:34	00:33:35	What do you want me to do?
544	00:33:35	00:33:38	The killer's been posting to your blog from different IP addresses around town.
545	00:33:39	00:33:43	So, you're gonna go on this computer, get on your blog, and post another reply to Mr. Anonymous.
546	00:33:43	00:33:51	You're going to get him to respond and when he does, you're going to keep him talking until our people can run an IP trace route and find out where he is now-- you understand?
547	00:33:51	00:33:52	No.
548	00:33:52	00:33:54	Just start typing.
549	00:33:54	00:33:55	Right.
550	00:33:55	00:33:57	What do you want me to say?
551	00:33:57	00:33:58	Just tell him he's a genius, all right?
552	00:33:58	00:34:01	Tell him that, uh, Michelangelo's got nothing on him.
553	00:34:01	00:34:02	Whatever, just think of something.
554	00:34:02	00:34:03	Come on.
555	00:34:03	00:34:05	Come on! Right.
556	00:34:10	00:34:11	I'll be right back. Keep typing.
557	00:34:19	00:34:20	Ma'am? (gasps)
558	00:34:20	00:34:21	My boy, my Charlie. Okay...
559	00:34:21	00:34:22	He's only nine years old.
560	00:34:23	00:34:24	He didn't come home from school today.
561	00:34:24	00:34:31	We had a fight this morning and I thought that he was at his dad's house-- we're divorced-- and then the school told me about some kind of alert that was happening.
562	00:34:31	00:34:33	Right. Do you have any idea where he might be going?
563	00:34:33	00:34:34	No, no. Okay...
564	00:34:34	00:34:36	Detective Vartann, I got him.
565	00:34:36	00:34:37	I got him talking.
566	00:34:52	00:34:54	LVPD! Please remain calm.
567	00:34:54	00:34:56	I'd like everybody to stay right where they are.
568	00:35:12	00:35:14	Where's the kid? What kid?
569	00:35:14	00:35:16	Get up! Get up. No...
570	00:35:16	00:35:18	Get him out of here. What-what kid?
571	00:35:18	00:35:19	Hey, hey! Hey!
572	00:35:19	00:35:21	I didn't do anything. Come on!
573	00:35:25	00:35:29	There was tan dust on the guy's hands like the other vics. Burlap fibers.
574	00:35:29	00:35:31	Does it help?
575	00:35:31	00:35:32	I don't know.
576	00:35:32	00:35:35	Blisterman didn't put himself in a burlap sack.
577	00:35:35	00:35:38	You know, maybe these fibers are environmental.
578	00:35:38	00:35:42	Like they're present in whatever space he's keeping his victims in.
579	00:35:42	00:35:46	You know, there's a lot of converted warehouses and industrial properties near this library.
580	00:35:46	00:35:49	If Blisterman already has the kid, he'd probably stay close to home.
581	00:35:49	00:35:52	We've got city plans for the area around the library.
582	00:35:52	00:35:54	Maps, building usage permits...
583	00:35:54	00:35:57	Okay, check every structure, every single one.
584	00:36:01	00:36:04	He's willing to talk, but only to someone who understands his work.
585	00:36:04	00:36:05	I'm ready to slap him around.
586	00:36:06	00:36:07	I figured you could show some restraint.
587	00:36:07	00:36:09	I'll try. Okay.
588	00:36:17	00:36:18	Mr. Blisterman.
589	00:36:18	00:36:24	Can you please turn the monitor so I can see it?
590	00:36:32	00:36:34	Could you tighten up the frame up a little?
591	00:36:36	00:36:38	The composition is...
592	00:36:39	00:36:40	It's a bit weak.
593	00:36:45	00:36:47	Yeah. Thank you.
594	00:36:47	00:36:49	Look...
595	00:36:49	00:36:51	I'm here to talk about the child.
596	00:36:51	00:36:53	I'm happy to talk.
597	00:36:53	00:36:59	I like to talk, but I want my words to be heard the way I speak them.
598	00:36:59	00:37:09	I want the world to see the words coming from my lips, so there can be no misinterpretation.
599	00:37:09	00:37:11	Nobody's going to misinterpret anything you say.
600	00:37:11	00:37:13	But if you don't start cooperating...
601	00:37:14	00:37:18	Don't, don't... rush me.
602	00:37:18	00:37:25	I want to talk about what I want to talk about, and I don't want... to be rushed, please.
603	00:37:27	00:37:32	That's the trouble with modern life, it's too much urgency.
604	00:37:32	00:37:35	It's too much speed.
605	00:37:36	00:37:39	Now I'm sweaty.
606	00:37:39	00:37:41	Do you have a handkerchief?
607	00:37:47	00:37:49	Thank you.
608	00:38:05	00:38:10	Aesthetics have always been very important to me.
609	00:38:12	00:38:18	Life wouldn't be worth living without beauty.
610	00:38:18	00:38:21	It's what makes us human.
611	00:38:21	00:38:23	What about the people you've murdered?
612	00:38:24	00:38:25	They were human.
613	00:38:25	00:38:29	Yeah, but...
614	00:38:29	00:38:34	they were nothing until I made them extraordinary.
615	00:38:34	00:38:37	How about the child?
616	00:38:37	00:38:41	Has he become extraordinary?
617	00:38:45	00:38:48	I have been alone my entire life.
618	00:38:48	00:38:57	I have tried and tried to achieve some recognition for my work, and I have been repeatedly and cruelly ignored.
619	00:38:58	00:39:04	And this has made me feel very... bad...
620	00:39:04	00:39:08	about myself.
621	00:39:08	00:39:09	Arthur.
622	00:39:09	00:39:15	You're going to be put to death if you don't help us.
623	00:39:15	00:39:17	I'm not scared of dying.
624	00:39:19	00:39:22	I just don't want to be forgotten.
625	00:39:33	00:39:35	I think I found it.
626	00:39:37	00:39:38	487 Franklyn Street.
627	00:39:39	00:39:45	It's a warehouse, formerly deeded to a company that manufactured natural fiber bags and shipping materials-- go.
628	00:39:45	00:39:46	I'll call it in.
629	00:39:49	00:40:00	I want something of who I was left behind so people will speak my name, and know who I was, after I'm gone.
630	00:40:00	00:40:03	Believe me.
631	00:40:03	00:40:05	No one will ever forget you.
632	00:40:08	00:40:10	You've made it.
633	00:40:10	00:40:12	You're a legend.
634	00:40:16	00:40:22	If I tell you where the boy is, you're going to turn the camera off, and then...
635	00:40:22	00:40:25	I'll be sad.
636	00:40:25	00:40:27	I won't turn the camera off.
637	00:40:29	00:40:31	I'm sorry.
638	00:40:33	00:40:35	Without the boy, the piece is incomplete.
639	00:40:48	00:40:51	487...
640	00:40:51	00:40:53	Franklyn Street.
641	00:40:55	00:40:58	You're far too late to save him.
642	00:41:00	00:41:02	Anyway...
643	00:41:02	00:41:05	I got what I wanted.
644	00:41:07	00:41:09	You'll remember me.
645	00:41:09	00:41:11	Won't you?
646	00:41:20	00:41:21	What the hell is that?
647	00:41:21	00:41:22	Sounds like a motor.
648	00:41:23	00:41:25	Take that hall.
649	00:42:18	00:42:20	All right, yeah, I got him.
650	00:42:31	00:42:34	Patrol, this is CSI Sanders.
651	00:42:35	00:42:36	We need paramedics.
652	00:42:39	00:42:41	Come on.
653	00:42:41	00:42:43	Come on.
654	00:42:46	00:42:48	Damn it, breathe! Breathe!
655	00:42:52	00:42:54	Come on.
656	00:42:54	00:42:55	Come on.
657	00:42:56	00:42:57	Breathe.
658	00:42:57	00:42:58	Come on.
659	00:43:08	00:43:10	Hey, it's okay.
660	00:43:10	00:43:14	Shh. It's okay.
661	00:43:14	00:43:16	You're all right now.
662	00:43:21	00:43:25	It's okay. It's okay.
