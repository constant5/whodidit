0	00:00:17	00:00:20	Does anybody have eyes on our mystery guy?
1	00:00:20	00:00:23	Unit one, negative. I'm on the main casino floor.
2	00:00:23	00:00:25	I'm heading over to BJ pit three.
3	00:00:26	00:00:28	Copy that, unit one.
4	00:00:28	00:00:30	We'll be watching.
5	00:00:35	00:00:36	Just get out of my way.
6	00:00:36	00:00:40	Hey, just a second. Go ahead, tough guy, huh! Break it up. Break up!
7	00:00:40	00:00:41	Hey, aren't you...!
8	00:00:44	00:00:46	Shots fired. Main floor. BJ pit three.
9	00:00:46	00:00:48	Dispatch, shooter is on the run.
10	00:00:48	00:00:50	All available security to BJ pit three.
11	00:00:50	00:00:52	Boatwright's down. Get an ambulance.
12	00:00:52	00:00:54	Find the shooter. I don't see him, I don't see him.
13	00:00:55	00:00:57	I got him.
14	00:00:57	00:00:58	Shooter's headed for the slot carousel.
15	00:00:59	00:01:00	There he goes.
16	00:01:00	00:01:03	He's headed for the guest elevators.
17	00:01:03	00:01:04	He's got a hostage. Bring up the elevator cams.
18	00:01:04	00:01:06	Give me the whole tower. Three across the board.
19	00:01:10	00:01:11	Get the police.
20	00:01:11	00:01:13	We need SWAT, now!
21	00:01:19	00:01:21	We got the suspect holed up on three.
22	00:01:21	00:01:23	Floors above and below evacuated.
23	00:01:23	00:01:25	Where's the negotiator? En route.
24	00:01:25	00:01:26	At least an hour away.
25	00:01:26	00:01:29	Well, I'm here now.
26	00:01:36	00:01:37	Everybody out of here.
27	00:01:37	00:01:38	Get everybody out of here.
28	00:01:40	00:01:41	Clear.
29	00:01:42	00:01:44	( cocks gun ) Clear.
30	00:01:46	00:01:48	Las Vegas Police. Open the door.
31	00:01:56	00:01:58	Well, I guess this is the place.
32	00:01:58	00:02:02	Homicide at residence. Viking Circle and Pico.
33	00:02:02	00:02:04	Just another domestic violence case.
34	00:02:04	00:02:06	I wish I had a nickel.
35	00:02:07	00:02:09	Janice Cutler. Shot in the mouth.
36	00:02:12	00:02:13	Single boy's the only smart one.
37	00:02:13	00:02:21	Judy and I deal with our marital problems a little differently-- counseling, separate vacations once a year.
38	00:02:21	00:02:23	She's never pulled a gun on me yet.
39	00:02:23	00:02:26	I got a shell casing.
40	00:02:26	00:02:27	Nine millimeter.
41	00:02:27	00:02:29	That accounts for the high-velocity spatter.
42	00:02:29	00:02:31	Where's the husband?
43	00:02:31	00:02:33	There was no car in the garage.
44	00:02:33	00:02:34	We can broadcast out for him.
45	00:02:34	00:02:37	There's no other signs of disturbance in here.
46	00:02:37	00:02:38	What about the rest of the house?
47	00:02:38	00:02:40	Nothing obvious.
48	00:02:40	00:02:43	How many domestics have you seen where someone got shot in the face and nothing else was disturbed?
49	00:02:44	00:02:46	What are you thinking?
50	00:02:46	00:02:49	That you married people take things too personally.
51	00:03:23	00:03:25	She's only been dead a few hours.
52	00:03:26	00:03:28	Signs of sex prior to death.
53	00:03:28	00:03:32	No vaginal trauma to suggest it wasn't amicable.
54	00:03:32	00:03:40	Assuming the husband had sex with her and then murdered her, he went from amorous to murderous in near record time. Well, maybe you were right.
55	00:03:40	00:03:41	It wasn't the husband.
56	00:03:41	00:03:44	But no semen, so I'd only be speculating.
57	00:03:44	00:03:45	What about the bullet?
58	00:03:45	00:03:47	Single gunshot wound.
59	00:03:47	00:03:52	Based on powder burns and stipling, muzzle was placed inside the mouth...
60	00:03:53	00:03:56	bullet then fragmented in her head.
61	00:03:56	00:03:58	Explains why Warrick couldn't find it at the scene.
62	00:03:58	00:04:00	Yeah, shooter wanted to make sure he didn't miss.
63	00:04:00	00:04:03	This was somebody who was emotionally close to her.
64	00:04:03	00:04:06	Gil...
65	00:04:06	00:04:09	Have you ever even been close to getting married?
66	00:04:10	00:04:11	Once.
67	00:04:11	00:04:13	When I was younger.
68	00:04:13	00:04:16	Her name was Nicole Daley.
69	00:04:16	00:04:19	I asked her to marry me.
70	00:04:19	00:04:20	We were classmates.
71	00:04:20	00:04:22	She liked bugs, too.
72	00:04:22	00:04:26	I gave her my grandmother's ring, but my mother made me get it back.
73	00:04:26	00:04:31	Second grade.
74	00:04:31	00:04:34	Was it the happiest day of your life?
75	00:04:34	00:04:35	Me and Tina?
76	00:04:36	00:04:37	Happened so fast.
77	00:04:37	00:04:39	Time will tell.
78	00:04:39	00:04:43	Why don't you take a look at this phone here and tell me what you think.
79	00:04:45	00:04:47	Blood on the keypad, away from the spatter.
80	00:04:47	00:04:48	A neighbor called it in.
81	00:04:49	00:04:51	If someone was in the house, they'd have dialed 911.
82	00:04:51	00:04:53	Dispatch never got a call.
83	00:04:53	00:04:56	Maybe the husband started to dial...
84	00:04:56	00:04:57	changed his mind and took off.
85	00:04:57	00:05:02	Maybe. I just wish it was a print and not a smudge.
86	00:05:02	00:05:04	Okay. Bedroom.
87	00:05:04	00:05:05	All right.
88	00:06:05	00:06:06	Hey.
89	00:06:06	00:06:07	I found these in his jacket.
90	00:06:07	00:06:10	Looks like the husband was planning a little vacation.
91	00:06:10	00:06:12	A little recreation on the side.
92	00:06:12	00:06:14	I found this under the bed.
93	00:06:14	00:06:21	And grass-- not the kind you smoke-- on the floor and in the closet, but all the shoes in the closet were clean.
94	00:06:21	00:06:23	So someone was walking around here with grass on their shoes?
95	00:06:23	00:06:27	Maybe it was the missing husband, or a desperate gardener.
96	00:06:27	00:06:30	Who was mowing more than the lawn?
97	00:06:33	00:06:35	Good call on the grass stains.
98	00:06:35	00:06:37	Police officers brought in your guy.
99	00:06:37	00:06:39	He was mowing a lawn down the street.
100	00:06:39	00:06:43	Well, he must be a great gardener, because Mrs. Cutler was paying him way too much.
101	00:06:43	00:06:44	Well... ( chuckles )
102	00:06:44	00:06:47	Wait till you see him.
103	00:06:47	00:06:48	Mr. Johnson?
104	00:06:48	00:06:51	It's Timmy, right?
105	00:06:51	00:06:53	This is Sara Sidle from the crime lab.
106	00:06:53	00:06:56	I didn't kill Mrs. Cutler, if that's what you're thinking.
107	00:06:56	00:06:57	How well do you know her?
108	00:06:57	00:06:59	We live across the street from the Cutlers.
109	00:06:59	00:07:01	We? My family.
110	00:07:01	00:07:03	Mother, father, and brothers.
111	00:07:03	00:07:06	So you still live at home? Until I graduate next month.
112	00:07:06	00:07:08	So mowing lawns is just your sideline?
113	00:07:08	00:07:09	I don't play sports.
114	00:07:09	00:07:11	Helps with the tuition.
115	00:07:11	00:07:14	Did Mr. or Mrs. Cutler ever invite you in their house?
116	00:07:14	00:07:15	On a cold day, yeah.
117	00:07:16	00:07:18	Sometimes she'd made me coffee.
118	00:07:18	00:07:20	But she writes you a check every month, like yesterday.
119	00:07:20	00:07:22	Yeah.
120	00:07:22	00:07:24	Did she hand you the check in her closet?
121	00:07:25	00:07:27	Or in her bedroom?
122	00:07:27	00:07:30	You forgot your sock.
123	00:07:32	00:07:34	Okay.
124	00:07:35	00:07:37	Yeah, I was there.
125	00:07:37	00:07:39	I was hittin' the wife.
126	00:07:39	00:07:40	You had sex with her?
127	00:07:40	00:07:42	Yeah.
128	00:07:42	00:07:43	But it wasn't my idea, all right?
129	00:07:44	00:07:45	She was...
130	00:07:45	00:07:48	She was really unhappy in her marriage.
131	00:07:49	00:07:52	Me and Mrs. Cutler were in the middle of it when...
132	00:07:52	00:07:54	when Mr. Cutler came home early.
133	00:07:55	00:07:58	He was supposed to be at work all night.
134	00:07:58	00:08:00	Hide! Yeah.
135	00:08:01	00:08:04	I guess that's when I lost my sock.
136	00:08:09	00:08:11	How was she, you little son of a bitch?
137	00:08:11	00:08:12	Now get out of here.
138	00:08:12	00:08:15	Mr. Cutler was... was so pissed, I...
139	00:08:15	00:08:17	I barely even recognized him.
140	00:08:17	00:08:18	You hear a gunshot?
141	00:08:18	00:08:20	No.
142	00:08:20	00:08:22	So Mrs. Cutler was still alive when you left the house?
143	00:08:22	00:08:24	I don't know.
144	00:08:24	00:08:26	I think so.
145	00:08:28	00:08:31	I didn't see anything else.
146	00:09:08	00:09:12	So, I hear your marriage is on the rocks, and you're shopping for hookers?
147	00:09:14	00:09:17	No, but I think I found one that Mr. Cutler likes.
148	00:09:17	00:09:19	Thumbprint on the front.
149	00:09:19	00:09:21	Four fingerprints on the back.
150	00:09:21	00:09:23	Sally. Sweet apple pie.
151	00:09:23	00:09:28	Hmm. Do you really think it's a good idea to sleep with a girl who advertises in a flyer?
152	00:09:28	00:09:32	Well, I don't really think there's any sleeping involved.
153	00:09:32	00:09:35	Hmm. Don't be shy, though.
154	00:09:35	00:09:36	Give her a call.
155	00:09:37	00:09:40	All right, for your enjoyment.
156	00:09:46	00:09:48	This is Sally. Who's this?
157	00:09:48	00:09:51	Hi. This is, uh... Dirk... Diggler.
158	00:09:51	00:09:52	I'm looking for a date.
159	00:09:53	00:09:54	What kind of date?
160	00:09:54	00:09:56	I'm taking a trip around the world.
161	00:09:56	00:09:57	Want to go?
162	00:09:57	00:09:59	Yeah, I'll come with you.
163	00:09:59	00:10:01	You sure you can afford the airfare, darlin'?
164	00:10:01	00:10:02	Is two G's enough?
165	00:10:02	00:10:03	Where you at?
166	00:10:03	00:10:06	3057 Westfall.
167	00:10:06	00:10:08	It's right off of Charleston.
168	00:10:08	00:10:10	It's a single level building, all the way in the back.
169	00:10:11	00:10:12	What do you look like?
170	00:10:12	00:10:14	Um...
171	00:10:14	00:10:16	I have a little Tom Cruise thing going.
172	00:10:16	00:10:19	All right, half an hour, and I'll be there.
173	00:10:19	00:10:20	All right.
174	00:10:21	00:10:22	Yeah, right.
175	00:10:22	00:10:23	Ah, sweet apple pie!
176	00:10:23	00:10:25	The Cruiser.
177	00:10:28	00:10:30	Calling me to a crime lab is cute.
178	00:10:30	00:10:32	It's still entrapment.
179	00:10:33	00:10:35	Well, you're not here about prostitution, sweetie.
180	00:10:35	00:10:36	Really?
181	00:10:36	00:10:38	No. I need your help with a homicide.
182	00:10:38	00:10:41	Why don't you go ahead and have a seat?
183	00:10:41	00:10:43	Thanks.
184	00:10:47	00:10:51	This man's wife was murdered last night.
185	00:10:51	00:10:53	His name's Willie Cutler.
186	00:10:53	00:10:54	Was he ever a client?
187	00:10:54	00:10:56	We dated.
188	00:10:56	00:10:57	Yeah.
189	00:10:57	00:11:03	He was trying to play the, you know, I'm a big baller role.
190	00:11:04	00:11:05	Do you got a present for me, baby?
191	00:11:05	00:11:10	He must have won some big jackpot or something-- I can tell when money's new.
192	00:11:10	00:11:14	He pulled this big wad out of his Wal-Mart pants.
193	00:11:17	00:11:18	But he seemed harmless.
194	00:11:22	00:11:24	Kind of sweet, actually.
195	00:11:24	00:11:26	He offered me a deal on a vacation.
196	00:11:26	00:11:29	Deal? What, like a travel agent?
197	00:11:29	00:11:31	I don't know. I guess.
198	00:11:31	00:11:33	He offered me this.
199	00:11:35	00:11:37	I've never been to Hawaii.
200	00:11:38	00:11:40	No...
201	00:11:40	00:11:42	No, me either.
202	00:11:47	00:11:49	I'd let you take me to Hawaii.
203	00:11:50	00:11:53	Yeah, I'm working.
204	00:11:53	00:11:54	So am I.
205	00:12:02	00:12:05	Tour historic Las Vegas.
206	00:12:05	00:12:07	History in Vegas gets imploded.
207	00:12:07	00:12:10	It's probably just a drive past the Flamingo where Bugsy Siegel took his leak.
208	00:12:11	00:12:13	Closed? Now wait a minute.
209	00:12:13	00:12:14	It should be open.
210	00:12:15	00:12:17	Well, it looks like it is.
211	00:12:17	00:12:18	Oh.
212	00:12:20	00:12:23	Hello?
213	00:12:24	00:12:26	Anybody here?
214	00:12:26	00:12:28	Las Vegas Police.
215	00:12:28	00:12:31	Hello? Catherine.
216	00:12:40	00:12:42	Control, this is CSI Willows.
217	00:12:44	00:12:50	We have a 419 at 4172 Hamilton.
218	00:12:50	00:12:53	Neon City Excursions.
219	00:12:53	00:12:55	Suspect may still be on the premises.
220	00:13:34	00:13:36	Please! Please don't!
221	00:13:36	00:13:38	Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
222	00:13:38	00:13:39	Don't kill me. Please, don't kill me.
223	00:13:39	00:13:41	It's all right, sir.
224	00:13:41	00:13:43	We're not going to hurt you; we're the police.
225	00:13:55	00:13:57	Thanks. I'll take that.
226	00:13:58	00:13:59	All right, bullet wound.
227	00:13:59	00:14:01	Let's see what the paramedics left me.
228	00:14:05	00:14:07	Irregular laceration, subcutaneous tissue only.
229	00:14:07	00:14:11	A few millimeters deeper, it would have nicked the intercostal artery.
230	00:14:11	00:14:14	That sounds bad. Yeah. Would've been a real mess.
231	00:14:14	00:14:15	You're a lucky man.
232	00:14:15	00:14:22	Flush out the wound, dress it with 4 x 4 gauze, start an IV, hang cefazolin and get some blood work done.
233	00:14:22	00:14:25	Oh, and get him a tetanus shot.
234	00:14:25	00:14:29	Ah, the warm fuzzy feeling of modern medicine.
235	00:14:29	00:14:31	Can I get something to wear?
236	00:14:31	00:14:32	Uh, yes, in a few minutes.
237	00:14:32	00:14:34	I need to document your wound.
238	00:14:34	00:14:37	Do you think you could lift your arms for me like this?
239	00:14:38	00:14:39	Thank you. That's perfect.
240	00:14:41	00:14:43	Why don't you tell us what happened.
241	00:14:43	00:14:45	Um. Not much to tell, really.
242	00:14:45	00:14:50	Uh... Cowboy Dan had the office working round the clock for the last week.
243	00:14:50	00:14:56	We were putting together a campaign for a new tour.
244	00:14:56	00:14:58	I just got back from breakfast.
245	00:14:58	00:15:01	I heard a shot, shouting.
246	00:15:07	00:15:09	I guess the guy didn't even know I was there.
247	00:15:15	00:15:18	I was so scared, I couldn't move.
248	00:15:18	00:15:20	So I just played dead.
249	00:15:23	00:15:25	Ow.
250	00:15:25	00:15:29	I don't even know how long I was there.
251	00:15:29	00:15:32	And then you guys came in and found me.
252	00:15:32	00:15:37	Do you think that you could indicate on this diagram where you were standing when you were shot?
253	00:15:38	00:15:40	Um...
254	00:15:40	00:15:44	I guess I was standing somewhere around here.
255	00:15:44	00:15:45	Thank you.
256	00:15:45	00:15:47	Look, I really need to call my wife.
257	00:15:47	00:15:50	I should have been home by now, and she's probably worried.
258	00:15:50	00:15:53	Um.... Mr. Cutler, when was the last time you were home?
259	00:15:54	00:15:56	Um...
260	00:15:56	00:15:59	I guess it was, uh...
261	00:15:59	00:16:01	probably yesterday morning.
262	00:16:01	00:16:02	Why?
263	00:16:04	00:16:05	Mr. Cutler.
264	00:16:05	00:16:09	I am very sorry, but... your wife is dead.
265	00:16:09	00:16:13	She was found shot last night in your home.
266	00:16:15	00:16:17	Wh...?
267	00:16:37	00:16:39	Single GSW to the forehead.
268	00:16:42	00:16:44	Stipling makes it close range.
269	00:16:46	00:16:48	At least he died with his boots on.
270	00:16:51	00:16:52	Cowboy Dan gets it first.
271	00:16:52	00:16:55	The shooter finds his next target.
272	00:16:56	00:16:58	Shoots him in the back.
273	00:17:04	00:17:05	That's the vic's desk.
274	00:17:05	00:17:07	He was getting a promotion.
275	00:17:07	00:17:10	Well, at least his day started out on a good note.
276	00:17:10	00:17:12	Looks like the gun's been wiped clean.
277	00:17:12	00:17:16	Doubt we'll get any prints. So what do you got, five nine-mil shell casings?
278	00:17:16	00:17:20	Two went back with the body, three... still in the walls.
279	00:17:20	00:17:22	So they're all accounted for.
280	00:17:33	00:17:38	So Willie Cutler must have been standing along this line when he was grazed by the bullet.
281	00:17:38	00:17:39	Looks about right.
282	00:17:39	00:17:41	It's consistent with his statement.
283	00:17:46	00:17:50	And if the shooter never saw him, he got under the desk really quickly.
284	00:17:51	00:17:53	I sure would have.
285	00:17:54	00:17:55	So what do you think, Greg?
286	00:17:55	00:17:59	Is Willie Cutler the luckiest guy in the world or the unluckiest?
287	00:17:59	00:18:01	I wouldn't want his luck either way.
288	00:18:03	00:18:12	Geez, you lose your wife, your boss, your co-worker, all in 24 hours; that's rough.
289	00:18:12	00:18:15	My heart goes out to you, pal.
290	00:18:15	00:18:16	Really.
291	00:18:16	00:18:17	Thank you.
292	00:18:17	00:18:21	Looks like someone's out to get you.
293	00:18:21	00:18:22	What do you mean?
294	00:18:22	00:18:29	Well, the way I see it, somebody's out to kill you and a lot of innocent people are getting in the way.
295	00:18:29	00:18:31	Yeah.
296	00:18:31	00:18:32	That's got to be it.
297	00:18:32	00:18:33	Yeah.
298	00:18:35	00:18:36	Who'd want to kill you?
299	00:18:36	00:18:39	I don't know.
300	00:18:39	00:18:41	Maybe it's just some nutcase.
301	00:18:41	00:18:45	A guy sees me on the street, and I remind him of somebody he hates.
302	00:18:45	00:18:47	Yeah, that's... that's a pretty good theory.
303	00:18:48	00:18:51	Want to hear another one?
304	00:18:51	00:18:52	Sure.
305	00:18:54	00:18:56	Well, this one starts with your wife banging the lawn boy.
306	00:18:56	00:18:58	Hmm?
307	00:18:58	00:18:59	Timmy?
308	00:18:59	00:19:00	Timmy.
309	00:19:02	00:19:03	What, you didn't know?
310	00:19:03	00:19:05	No. Really?
311	00:19:05	00:19:09	'Cause according to Timmy, you found him in the bedroom and you dragged him out of the closet.
312	00:19:09	00:19:11	Well, he's lying.
313	00:19:11	00:19:12	'Cause I wasn't home.
314	00:19:12	00:19:15	Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right.
315	00:19:15	00:19:17	You were on the love boat with Sally the hooker.
316	00:19:21	00:19:23	Look, my wife and I had some problems.
317	00:19:24	00:19:25	You know, all married couples do.
318	00:19:25	00:19:26	Hey.
319	00:19:28	00:19:32	I was getting a promotion at work.
320	00:19:32	00:19:35	At least I thought I was.
321	00:19:35	00:19:37	So I threw myself a little celebration.
322	00:19:37	00:19:39	I guess that makes you a premature celebrator.
323	00:19:40	00:19:43	Tell me about that work-promotion thing.
324	00:19:43	00:19:45	Why were you passed up?
325	00:19:46	00:19:49	Cowboy Dan just couldn't bring himself to promote a felon.
326	00:19:49	00:19:51	Yeah, no, I've-I've read your record.
327	00:19:51	00:19:52	I mean, it's minor league.
328	00:19:52	00:19:56	I mean, like, joyriding at 19.
329	00:19:56	00:20:00	Stupid kid stuff. You know, it follows you around the rest of your life.
330	00:20:00	00:20:02	Oh, believe me, I know.
331	00:20:02	00:20:04	Look, here's what we got here.
332	00:20:04	00:20:05	Cowboy Dan is dead.
333	00:20:05	00:20:08	The guy who got your promotion is dead.
334	00:20:08	00:20:15	It seems to me, that the one with the most motive to kill in this sad tale... is you.
335	00:20:17	00:20:19	I got shot, too.
336	00:20:19	00:20:21	Well... you know...
337	00:20:21	00:20:22	kinda.
338	00:20:22	00:20:23	Look.
339	00:20:25	00:20:29	Last night you wired 50-K from your home equity account to a marker at the Lucky Dragon.
340	00:20:29	00:20:30	So?
341	00:20:30	00:20:33	So, I mean, it wasn't for Chinese food.
342	00:20:33	00:20:37	So maybe you hired a professional killer to hit your wife, your boss, your coworker.
343	00:20:37	00:20:38	That's not true!
344	00:20:38	00:20:43	Told them to take a little, you know, love bite out of you to, you know, make you look nice and innocent, you know?
345	00:20:44	00:20:45	I didn't kill my wife!
346	00:20:46	00:20:47	I lost this money at the tables.
347	00:20:50	00:20:52	You know...
348	00:20:52	00:20:57	This has been the worst day of my life, and I still haven't had a chance to see my wife's body-- I want to leave.
349	00:20:57	00:20:59	But we're not done here, Willie. We're done!
350	00:20:59	00:21:03	You can't prove that I killed anybody because I didn't kill anybody.
351	00:21:03	00:21:06	And if you're not going to charge me, I'm going to leave.
352	00:21:06	00:21:09	I want to see my wife's body now!
353	00:21:09	00:21:14	Well, I pushed the guy as hard as I could, but there's a lot of media heat on this one.
354	00:21:14	00:21:15	I had to cut him loose.
355	00:21:16	00:21:18	Well, he's got a bullet wound and a dead wife.
356	00:21:18	00:21:20	For now, the evidence says he's a victim.
357	00:21:20	00:21:23	Well, that's what I told the unit who's shadowing him.
358	00:22:01	00:22:04	Sunstar Cabs.
359	00:22:04	00:22:12	Yeah, we had several pickups from that office park this morning, but, uh, look, those drivers are all off right now, and they take one look at my caller I.D., they ain't pickin' up.
360	00:22:12	00:22:14	All right, well, what about drop-offs?
361	00:22:14	00:22:16	Oh, definitely got something for you there.
362	00:22:16	00:22:17	Hey, Nicco. Yeah?
363	00:22:17	00:22:18	You'll love this.
364	00:22:18	00:22:21	Nicco, tell these guys about that guy, huh?
365	00:22:21	00:22:22	The drive-around- all-night guy?
366	00:22:22	00:22:24	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
367	00:22:24	00:22:28	Pick him up near Viking 45 a.m.
368	00:22:28	00:22:30	That's right around the time Janice Cutler was killed.
369	00:22:30	00:22:31	It's right near her house.
370	00:22:31	00:22:33	Is this your cab?
371	00:22:33	00:22:34	Yeah.
372	00:22:34	00:22:36	Mind if I take a look? Okay.
373	00:22:36	00:22:38	So?
374	00:22:38	00:22:43	He didn't know where he wanted to go, but he said I should drive anyway, so I drive.
375	00:22:43	00:22:45	He sees a store, he says stop. Buys a beer.
376	00:22:45	00:22:48	Then he says, drive, stop, cigarettes, and drive some more.
377	00:22:48	00:22:49	I'm all around town.
378	00:22:49	00:22:51	Five, six hours.
379	00:22:51	00:22:52	Did you get his name?
380	00:22:52	00:22:54	Uh... I think it was Sammy.
381	00:22:54	00:22:56	Yeah. Yeah, that's what he said.
382	00:22:56	00:23:01	He asked me to wait for him by this office place, but by then it was at the end of my shift.
383	00:23:01	00:23:04	I told him, I got to get home to my wife.
384	00:23:04	00:23:09	And he asked me, do I love my wife, and I told him, hey, she loves me.
385	00:23:09	00:23:12	And he said, I was a lucky man, which I am.
386	00:23:12	00:23:13	And he left.
387	00:23:14	00:23:15	He gave me a big tip.
388	00:23:16	00:23:17	You need to check this out.
389	00:23:17	00:23:19	Is that the guy who called himself Sammy?
390	00:23:19	00:23:21	Looks a lot like Willie.
391	00:23:21	00:23:23	Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy.
392	00:23:24	00:23:25	Yup.
393	00:23:27	00:23:29	That's the gun.
394	00:23:50	00:23:54	So, Willie Cutler had an older brother, Sammy.
395	00:23:54	00:23:56	Sammy did time in Chino for grand theft auto.
396	00:23:56	00:24:00	Willie had a vehicle-related felony on his record, too.
397	00:24:00	00:24:01	Yeah, the same incident.
398	00:24:01	00:24:04	See, Willie was a first-time offender, so he pled out.
399	00:24:04	00:24:07	But Sammy had a record, so the judge gave him a hard time.
400	00:24:07	00:24:09	So he got in trouble on the inside.
401	00:24:09	00:24:10	He did an extended sentence.
402	00:24:10	00:24:12	He got out six months ago.
403	00:24:12	00:24:15	I got a fax from the cab company I want to show you.
404	00:24:15	00:24:17	Check it out.
405	00:24:17	00:24:21	They get called out to that office park where the shooting took place.
406	00:24:21	00:24:23	Driver said the fare was a no-show.
407	00:24:23	00:24:26	Requested destination-- Lucky Dragon Casino. Hmm.
408	00:24:26	00:24:28	I sent a unit out to look for Sammy.
409	00:24:28	00:24:31	You know, this could be a revenge story.
410	00:24:31	00:24:33	Willie gets a life, Sammy goes to prison.
411	00:24:33	00:24:35	Sammy gets out, tries to get even.
412	00:24:35	00:24:38	Well, if Sammy was trying to get even, why did Willie keep quiet about it?
413	00:24:38	00:24:40	He's his brother's keeper.
414	00:24:40	00:24:42	It's in the Bible.
415	00:24:45	00:24:47	This is the man that we're looking for.
416	00:24:47	00:24:49	Please keep your eyes peeled.
417	00:24:49	00:24:51	He may have been here last night.
418	00:24:51	00:24:54	I want you to cover every square inch of this place.
419	00:24:54	00:24:56	Let's spread out; let's move it.
420	00:25:00	00:25:02	So, this is Sammy Cutler.
421	00:25:04	00:25:05	This is his mug shot.
422	00:25:05	00:25:10	It's a few years old, and this is what he looks like now.
423	00:25:13	00:25:16	Hey, Sara, you're working the office shooting, right?
424	00:25:16	00:25:18	Yeah, and the dead wife.
425	00:25:18	00:25:20	Autopsy reports on the two D.B.'s.
426	00:25:20	00:25:23	Grissom wanted them ASAP, and I was in the neighborhood.
427	00:25:23	00:25:25	Thanks. I'll pass them along.
428	00:25:27	00:25:29	Somebody at the office get knifed?
429	00:25:29	00:25:31	No.
430	00:25:31	00:25:33	Kind of looks like a knife wound.
431	00:25:33	00:25:34	Victim survived the shooting.
432	00:25:34	00:25:37	He said he was grazed by a stray bullet.
433	00:25:37	00:25:39	Really?
434	00:25:40	00:25:44	This is an irregular laceration with no defining features.
435	00:25:44	00:25:49	A grazing GSW is usually accompanied by some marginal abrasion.
436	00:25:49	00:25:50	There's none here.
437	00:25:50	00:25:52	Any idea what might have caused a wound like this?
438	00:25:52	00:25:54	Yeah, lots of things.
439	00:25:54	00:25:55	Something sharp.
440	00:25:57	00:25:59	Hmm.
441	00:25:59	00:26:02	What's this blue discoloration?
442	00:26:03	00:26:06	Kind of looks like ink.
443	00:26:06	00:26:08	Doesn't it?
444	00:26:08	00:26:09	Mm-hmm.
445	00:26:14	00:26:17	Catherine found this under Willie Cutler's desk.
446	00:26:17	00:26:19	Thought the blood was incidental.
447	00:26:30	00:26:33	Sodium rhodizonate is negative.
448	00:26:33	00:26:35	No lead in the tear.
449	00:26:35	00:26:37	No bullet.
450	00:26:37	00:26:40	So, Willie tried to make it look like he was shot.
451	00:26:40	00:26:43	Grabs a ball point pin.
452	00:26:45	00:26:47	Drags it across his ribs.
453	00:26:54	00:26:55	Did I miss something?
454	00:26:56	00:26:57	Don't know.
455	00:26:58	00:27:00	We'll find out.
456	00:27:02	00:27:05	We've been running a major poker tournament here all week.
457	00:27:05	00:27:06	You know what the loser gets?
458	00:27:07	00:27:08	Baseball caps.
459	00:27:08	00:27:11	There's about 400 of them down there right now.
460	00:27:11	00:27:13	Keep looking.
461	00:27:33	00:27:35	Hey, baby.
462	00:27:35	00:27:36	What's up?
463	00:27:37	00:27:37	Nothin' much.
464	00:27:38	00:27:38	Where you at?
465	00:27:39	00:27:40	I'm at the Venetian.
466	00:27:40	00:27:43	Canyon Ranch, getting a... manicure.
467	00:27:45	00:27:47	Hope you're in for a good back scratching session tonight.
468	00:27:47	00:27:48	Who you talking about?
469	00:27:48	00:27:50	What?
470	00:27:50	00:27:51	Me or the guy standing next to you?
471	00:27:52	00:27:55	Look up. You see that little dome above your head?
472	00:27:55	00:27:56	Give it a wave.
473	00:27:56	00:27:59	That's me in the surveillance room, watching you lie to me.
474	00:27:59	00:28:01	Warrick...
475	00:28:01	00:28:04	Man, and I didn't even have to call that show Cheaters.
476	00:28:04	00:28:05	You think you know what you're talking about?
477	00:28:05	00:28:07	Don't even bother coming home tonight.
478	00:28:07	00:28:10	I'll just text you the storage space your stuff'll be in.
479	00:28:10	00:28:12	You want to know what's up, huh? What's really up?
480	00:28:12	00:28:13	I can see what's up.
481	00:28:13	00:28:15	You can't see a damn thing.
482	00:28:16	00:28:19	He's a V.I.P. host helping me plan your birthday party.
483	00:28:19	00:28:23	I hope you enjoy spending it alone.
484	00:28:46	00:28:47	Well, hey.
485	00:28:47	00:28:49	What are you doing?
486	00:28:49	00:28:50	Serology.
487	00:28:50	00:28:53	Serology? Now, I read about that in my History of Forensic Science classes.
488	00:28:53	00:28:58	So, what exactly is it you're trying to do?
489	00:28:58	00:29:01	Lattes Crust method for determining blood type.
490	00:29:01	00:29:04	You know, for you, I clear the decks.
491	00:29:04	00:29:07	I mean, I can just rush your samples through DNA.
492	00:29:07	00:29:09	I need it faster than DNA.
493	00:29:09	00:29:13	And I don't need a full profile anyway, just ABO type.
494	00:29:14	00:29:16	You mind if I stick around and watch?
495	00:29:16	00:29:17	Don't you have something better to do?
496	00:29:17	00:29:21	Yeah, I do, but some guy's using my lab.
497	00:29:23	00:29:26	Okay, now as I recall, the reagents have to be fresh.
498	00:29:26	00:29:29	Right? So, where did you get those?
499	00:29:29	00:29:31	I keep some in my Fridge for emergencies.
500	00:29:31	00:29:33	You got anything else in there?
501	00:29:33	00:29:34	Bottle of tequila, perhaps?
502	00:29:34	00:29:36	Severed head?
503	00:29:38	00:29:40	I don't keep tequila.
504	00:30:26	00:30:29	Jim, you have to bring in Willie Cutler.
505	00:30:29	00:30:31	Willie got loose. He slipped our surveillance.
506	00:30:31	00:30:33	What's up?
507	00:30:33	00:30:37	We found high velocity spatter consistent with the wife on his shirt.
508	00:30:38	00:30:40	He was in the room when she was shot.
509	00:30:40	00:30:41	He could have been holding the gun.
510	00:30:41	00:30:43	Maybe they were working together.
511	00:30:43	00:30:46	That would explain what Sammy was doing at the Lucky Dragon.
512	00:30:46	00:30:48	Willie lost a lot of money there.
513	00:30:48	00:30:51	So either he did it, or he's covering for his brother.
514	00:30:51	00:30:52	Yeah.
515	00:30:52	00:30:53	Maybe he's got unfinished business there.
516	00:30:54	00:30:55	Yeah.
517	00:31:08	00:31:11	Ow! Man, what the hell is your problem?
518	00:31:11	00:31:12	Just get out of my way. Oh, you're a tough guy?
519	00:31:12	00:31:14	Go ahead and go through me then if you...
520	00:31:14	00:31:15	Huh? You think you want some of this, huh?
521	00:31:16	00:31:17	Tough guy, huh?
522	00:31:17	00:31:19	Hey, break it up, break it up!
523	00:31:19	00:31:21	Hey, aren't you...?
524	00:31:25	00:31:26	Shots fired. Main floor.
525	00:31:26	00:31:27	BJ pit three...
526	00:31:37	00:31:38	Get out of my way!
527	00:31:42	00:31:44	Hey! Hey! Get off of me!
528	00:31:44	00:31:46	What are you doing? Help!
529	00:31:46	00:31:47	Shut up, or I'll kill you.
530	00:31:47	00:31:49	Help! Help me!
531	00:32:06	00:32:08	This is a radio check. Do you read me?
532	00:32:09	00:32:10	Copy that?
533	00:32:12	00:32:13	Kill word is Jim.
534	00:32:20	00:32:21	Hello?
535	00:32:21	00:32:22	Hey, Willie.
536	00:32:22	00:32:24	It's me, uh, Jim Brass.
537	00:32:24	00:32:25	Remember me?
538	00:32:25	00:32:27	Guess what? I'm right outside your door.
539	00:32:27	00:32:29	I will blow her head off.
540	00:32:29	00:32:30	I'll blow both our heads straight off.
541	00:32:31	00:32:32	You understand me?!
542	00:32:32	00:32:33	Look, I understand.
543	00:32:33	00:32:34	I understand, Willie, I do.
544	00:32:35	00:32:37	Look, I just... I just want this to end peacefully.
545	00:32:37	00:32:39	For everybody.
546	00:32:39	00:32:40	I'm not coming out.
547	00:32:40	00:32:42	Oh, I don't want you to come out, Willie.
548	00:32:42	00:32:43	I want you to let me in.
549	00:32:43	00:32:49	Look, I'm not armed.
550	00:32:49	00:32:50	Look through the peep hole.
551	00:32:50	00:32:51	Why do you want to come in here?
552	00:32:51	00:32:53	Just to talk to you, Willie.
553	00:32:53	00:32:57	I mean, you're a smart guy, I think maybe you and I, we can figure a way out of this.
554	00:32:57	00:32:58	Come on, check me out.
555	00:32:58	00:33:02	Okay, look, I'm going to put the phone down now, so you can see me, okay?
556	00:33:11	00:33:14	Look... no gun.
557	00:33:25	00:33:26	Hey, Willie.
558	00:33:26	00:33:28	It's me.
559	00:33:28	00:33:29	I'm alone, and I'm unarmed.
560	00:33:29	00:33:31	Close that door.
561	00:33:36	00:33:38	Either I walk out here right now, or she dies.
562	00:33:38	00:33:41	Look... nobody's going to die, Willie.
563	00:33:41	00:33:45	Not you, not her, not me, not Sammy, not anyone.
564	00:33:46	00:33:48	You sure about that?
565	00:33:48	00:33:50	Oh, yeah, I'm sure about that.
566	00:33:50	00:33:52	Then I want to talk to my brother.
567	00:33:52	00:33:53	Okay, I can arrange that.
568	00:33:53	00:33:54	We have him in custody downstairs.
569	00:33:54	00:33:55	You're lying!
570	00:33:55	00:33:56	Hey, you got the gun.
571	00:33:57	00:33:58	I'm not... I wouldn't lie to you.
572	00:33:58	00:34:01	But I need you to do something for me.
573	00:34:02	00:34:07	I need you to let this woman go, and I'll dial up your brother downstairs.
574	00:34:08	00:34:09	Where is he?
575	00:34:09	00:34:13	He's in the holding room, which is in the basement of the casino.
576	00:34:13	00:34:15	He was just trying to help me.
577	00:34:15	00:34:16	Look, I'm just trying to help you too, Willie.
578	00:34:17	00:34:21	Point the gun at me, not at her, and let this nice young woman go, come on. No way.
579	00:34:21	00:34:22	Point the gun at me, Willie.
580	00:34:22	00:34:23	You really have my brother?
581	00:34:24	00:34:25	Yeah, I'm gonna call... Hold on.
582	00:34:25	00:34:26	I want to talk to him.
583	00:34:26	00:34:28	Hold on.
584	00:34:32	00:34:33	Brown.
585	00:34:33	00:34:35	This is Brass.
586	00:34:35	00:34:38	Look, I need you to get Samuel Cutler on the phone.
587	00:34:38	00:34:40	I'm here with his brother, Willie, and he'd like to talk to him.
588	00:34:40	00:34:45	So, could you go down to the holding room and get Samuel Cutler on the line and call me back?
589	00:34:45	00:34:46	Are you with Willie right now?
590	00:34:46	00:34:49	Yes, I'm with him, and he'd like to speak with his brother.
591	00:34:49	00:34:51	We're still looking for him in surveillance.
592	00:34:51	00:34:52	It could take some time.
593	00:34:52	00:34:53	How much time?
594	00:34:53	00:34:55	I don't see his face, she dies!
595	00:34:55	00:34:57	Okay, okay, okay. Look, look.
596	00:34:57	00:35:00	I need you to get Samuel Cutler up here as soon as possible.
597	00:35:01	00:35:02	Okay, Brass, we're doing the best we can.
598	00:35:02	00:35:04	I want you to hang in there, take care of yourself.
599	00:35:04	00:35:07	If he's in this casino, we're going to find him.
600	00:35:07	00:35:08	Thank you.
601	00:35:08	00:35:10	He'll be here.
602	00:35:10	00:35:13	Okay? Now, I just want you to point the gun at me.
603	00:35:13	00:35:15	That's good. Not at her.
604	00:35:15	00:35:17	That's it-- cause it's just you and me now, all right?
605	00:35:17	00:35:19	I'm the hostage, all right?
606	00:35:22	00:35:23	What's your name?
607	00:35:23	00:35:24	Jackie.
608	00:35:24	00:35:26	Jackie. It's going to be okay, Jackie.
609	00:35:26	00:35:28	It's going to be okay, Willie.
610	00:35:29	00:35:30	It's just you and me now.
611	00:35:30	00:35:32	This is all going to be over soon.
612	00:35:42	00:35:49	Oh, yesterday, I spent $5,000 on a hooker because I thought I was getting a $15,000 promotion.
613	00:35:49	00:35:55	When I went to work, I got the news that I'd been passed over.
614	00:35:55	00:35:58	So now you're five large in the hole, hmm?
615	00:35:58	00:36:00	Well, way I saw it, I was 15 in the hole.
616	00:36:01	00:36:05	So I went to a cash machine and I wired myself 50-K.
617	00:36:05	00:36:06	Every cent I own.
618	00:36:08	00:36:10	For a second I was up, I was killin' em.
619	00:36:10	00:36:14	They were serving me cocktails, and calling me sir.
620	00:36:15	00:36:18	And then the pit boss got involved and I hit a bad streak.
621	00:36:18	00:36:20	So I called Sammy.
622	00:36:24	00:36:26	Bust, bust, bust, bust!
623	00:36:26	00:36:28	Damn it! God!
624	00:36:28	00:36:29	Ah, God!
625	00:36:31	00:36:33	What? What?
626	00:36:33	00:36:34	Willie? What?
627	00:36:34	00:36:36	Let me get you out of here.
628	00:36:38	00:36:40	What happened when you got home?
629	00:36:42	00:36:43	Things got worse.
630	00:36:43	00:36:45	I lost everything.
631	00:36:45	00:36:47	Our entire savings.
632	00:36:47	00:36:49	I'm sorry.
633	00:36:49	00:36:50	You stupid lowlife.
634	00:36:50	00:36:52	That was my money, too!
635	00:36:52	00:36:54	You are such a loser.
636	00:36:54	00:36:55	Just like your degenerate brother.
637	00:37:01	00:37:08	Sammy told me to stay put, and he said I should clean up the mess.
638	00:37:08	00:37:10	He said he was going to take care of me.
639	00:37:10	00:37:13	Why didn't you call the cops? I can't turn him in.
640	00:37:13	00:37:15	And I knew I'd get blamed.
641	00:37:22	00:37:28	Willie Cutler's marker was signed by a blackjack pit boss, This is last night's surveillance.
642	00:37:37	00:37:40	So the pit boss gives Willie the heave-ho, with chips still on the table.
643	00:37:40	00:37:44	Yeah, that's about a $10,000 marker.
644	00:37:44	00:37:46	Casino owed him money, that's why Willie went back.
645	00:37:46	00:37:48	And what about Sammy?
646	00:37:49	00:37:51	I haven't seen him.
647	00:37:52	00:37:55	I tried to find him myself.
648	00:37:55	00:37:58	I figured I could get him to Mexico or something.
649	00:37:58	00:38:01	I drove around for hours.
650	00:38:01	00:38:02	Nothing.
651	00:38:04	00:38:10	So I went back to my office, and that's when I saw Cowboy Dan and Roger.
652	00:38:12	00:38:17	And I knew what Sammy meant when he said he was going to take care of me.
653	00:38:17	00:38:19	He was going to give me a clean slate.
654	00:38:19	00:38:21	He was going to kill everyone that wronged me.
655	00:38:21	00:38:23	But she hasn't wronged you.
656	00:38:23	00:38:26	Jackie hasn't done anything to hurt you.
657	00:38:26	00:38:28	So why would you want to hurt her?
658	00:38:28	00:38:30	Let's cut her loose.
659	00:38:30	00:38:32	I don't want to hurt anybody.
660	00:38:32	00:38:34	That's right, Willie.
661	00:38:35	00:38:36	You don't want to hurt anybody.
662	00:38:36	00:38:42	You kill somebody, even by accident, you can never take it back.
663	00:38:42	00:38:45	People never look at you the same way again.
664	00:38:45	00:38:47	And you know what?
665	00:38:47	00:38:49	You can't look at yourself the same way again, either.
666	00:38:51	00:38:52	Griss?
667	00:38:52	00:38:53	You got to see this.
668	00:38:54	00:38:55	I found it on the Internet.
669	00:39:06	00:39:08	Me and Sammy?
670	00:39:09	00:39:11	We used to be so tight.
671	00:39:11	00:39:12	Mm.
672	00:39:12	00:39:15	And that stupid car.
673	00:39:15	00:39:19	He always felt so guilty about dragging me into that, but it wasn't his fault.
674	00:39:19	00:39:20	He wasn't to blame.
675	00:39:20	00:39:21	Well...
676	00:39:22	00:39:24	Just the phone. Just the phone.
677	00:39:24	00:39:27	( cell phone rings ) Take it easy.
678	00:39:32	00:39:33	Yeah.
679	00:39:33	00:39:36	Jim? Sammy Cutler's dead.
680	00:39:36	00:39:40	He died in a car crash in Mexico two months ago.
681	00:39:40	00:39:42	Willie had to know.
682	00:39:42	00:39:43	He's been playing us.
683	00:39:43	00:39:44	I got it, yeah. Thanks.
684	00:39:51	00:39:53	Hey, Willie.
685	00:39:54	00:39:55	Sammy's not coming up.
686	00:39:57	00:39:59	But I guess we both know that, right?
687	00:40:00	00:40:01	Yeah.
688	00:40:04	00:40:06	It's a good thing I have the gun.
689	00:40:13	00:40:14	Jim.
