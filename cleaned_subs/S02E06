1,00:00:52,00:00:56,No! No!
2,00:00:56,00:00:59,(police siren blaring)
3,00:00:59,00:01:02,(garbled radio transmissions in background)
4,00:01:03,00:01:05,Call said one dead body.
5,00:01:05,00:01:06,O'RILEY: Caught him red-handed.
6,00:01:06,00:01:08,Ben Jennings.
7,00:01:12,00:01:14,"Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab."
8,00:01:14,00:01:16,You want to tell us what's going on?
9,00:01:16,00:01:18,What happened here?
10,00:01:20,00:01:22,You have anything to say?
11,00:01:24,00:01:27,You don't have to talk to us.
12,00:01:28,00:01:30,He'll talk to us.
13,00:02:06,00:02:07,(background radio transmissions)
14,00:02:07,00:02:09,See that lividity?
15,00:02:09,00:02:12,Blood settled at the time of death.
16,00:02:12,00:02:15,Body's been moved from the murder scene.
17,00:02:15,00:02:16,Impound his car.
18,00:02:16,00:02:19,"Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork."
19,00:02:19,00:02:21,"My bad, Sara."
20,00:02:21,00:02:26,Let's process this guy shall we?
21,00:02:26,00:02:29,"Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!"
22,00:02:37,00:02:39,"Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner."
23,00:02:41,00:02:42,"Arms out, away from your body."
24,00:02:42,00:02:45,That's it. Stay just like that.
25,00:02:52,00:02:53,Give me your right foot.
26,00:02:53,00:02:55,Other right.
27,00:02:56,00:02:56,Put it down.
28,00:02:57,00:02:58,Lift it up.
29,00:02:59,00:03:01,GRISSOM: Hold still.
30,00:03:03,00:03:07,Possible secondary transfer.
31,00:03:09,00:03:11,Got some red fibers.
32,00:03:14,00:03:15,Other foot.
33,00:03:15,00:03:16,Lift it up.
34,00:03:16,00:03:17,Put it down.
35,00:03:22,00:03:23,GRISSOM: No defensive wounds.
36,00:03:23,00:03:26,No hematomas.
37,00:03:26,00:03:28,Victim didn't fight back.
38,00:03:28,00:03:29,Probably didn't see it coming.
39,00:03:32,00:03:33,Matthew...
40,00:03:34,00:03:36,"tag that body for special processing, VIP room."
41,00:03:36,00:03:40,"Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails."
42,00:03:50,00:03:58,"""D.B., Mediterranean Casino, Women's Spa."" Body is Shelley Danvers."
43,00:03:58,00:04:01,DOB: 10/10/81.
44,00:04:01,00:04:03,Employee walked in to get towels...
45,00:04:06,00:04:08,found her here.
46,00:04:15,00:04:21,"A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFOs?"
47,00:04:23,00:04:24,Done fell out.
48,00:04:24,00:04:26,That's what the night manager says.
49,00:04:29,00:04:30,BROWN: Miss?
50,00:04:34,00:04:36,We're from the Crime Lab.
51,00:04:36,00:04:39,You found the deceased?
52,00:04:39,00:04:42,"Yes, I was, um..."
53,00:04:42,00:04:45,just getting some towels and I walked in and she was there.
54,00:04:45,00:04:47,"WILLOWS: Hey, Brass..."
55,00:04:47,00:04:48,you touch this body?
56,00:04:48,00:04:50,"Yeah, I was born yesterday."
57,00:04:50,00:04:55,"Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else."
58,00:04:55,00:04:57,Miss...
59,00:04:57,00:05:00,you know anything about redressing the body?
60,00:05:00,00:05:01,"Well, she was naked."
61,00:05:01,00:05:03,I-I-I thought she should be covered.
62,00:05:03,00:05:06,"Did you move the body here, too?"
63,00:05:06,00:05:08,Guests were looking in.
64,00:05:08,00:05:09,I put a robe on her.
65,00:05:09,00:05:12,It's not like it's a crime or anything.
66,00:05:12,00:05:14,"Actually, it is."
67,00:05:14,00:05:17,Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.
68,00:05:22,00:05:23,"Flour, maybe?"
69,00:05:23,00:05:25,But what kind?
70,00:05:25,00:05:27,All-purpose?
71,00:05:27,00:05:29,Self-rising?
72,00:05:29,00:05:30,Pastry?
73,00:05:30,00:05:33,Trace will probably have a better idea.
74,00:05:35,00:05:39,I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.
75,00:05:39,00:05:40,What about the neck?
76,00:05:40,00:05:42,Any fibers in the wound?
77,00:05:42,00:05:43,You told me to wait for you.
78,00:05:43,00:05:45,"Well, that hasn't stopped you yet."
79,00:05:45,00:05:47,I did observe some fibers in the wound.
80,00:05:47,00:05:49,"I didn't collect them, though."
81,00:05:49,00:05:51,Be my guest.
82,00:05:56,00:05:58,Yellow.
83,00:05:58,00:06:01,"Not cotton; satin, maybe."
84,00:06:06,00:06:08,Dress shirt...
85,00:06:08,00:06:09,but no tie.
86,00:06:10,00:06:12,Strangled with his own tie?
87,00:06:14,00:06:16,Find me on the flour.
88,00:06:18,00:06:21,"BROWN: ""Shelley Danvers""-- appointment 8:00."
89,00:06:21,00:06:26,"Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the Jacuzzi facilities this evening?"
90,00:06:26,00:06:27,"Not that I remember, no."
91,00:06:27,00:06:29,(gurney clanging)
92,00:06:29,00:06:30,What? You don't believe me?
93,00:06:31,00:06:33,"Well, you lied to us before."
94,00:06:33,00:06:36,"It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a Jacuzzi."
95,00:06:36,00:06:38,Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under.
96,00:06:39,00:06:40,The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.
97,00:06:40,00:06:42,"Well, that didn't happen here."
98,00:06:42,00:06:44,She did not drown on these premises.
99,00:06:44,00:06:50,"Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you."
100,00:06:50,00:06:54,"Oliver Dunne; corporate lawyer, father of two."
101,00:06:54,00:06:57,You get all that from his dentals?
102,00:06:57,00:06:58,His wife-- widow.
103,00:06:58,00:07:00,She came down to I.D. his property.
104,00:07:00,00:07:01,.380s?
105,00:07:01,00:07:08,"Last one I recovered entered through his abdominals pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique."
106,00:07:08,00:07:11,"That's not what killed him, is it?"
107,00:07:11,00:07:13,We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound.
108,00:07:14,00:07:15,I think it's from his tie.
109,00:07:15,00:07:17,You might be right.
110,00:07:17,00:07:19,He died of asphyxiation.
111,00:07:19,00:07:22,Tie probably closed the windpipe.
112,00:07:22,00:07:26,"Without oxygen, the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up."
113,00:07:26,00:07:29,Whole pulmonary system shut down.
114,00:07:29,00:07:34,What you may have here is the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.
115,00:07:34,00:07:39,Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?
116,00:07:39,00:07:43,SIDLE: I cannot tell you why but I might be able to tell you where.
117,00:07:43,00:07:44,A pizza shop.
118,00:07:44,00:07:50,"The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content-- seven percent protein-- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing."
119,00:07:51,00:07:53,"So, why did you rule out bakeries?"
120,00:07:53,00:07:55,"Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype; double zero."
121,00:07:55,00:07:58,It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens.
122,00:07:58,00:08:01,"Oh, and Trace picked up some oregano in the sample."
123,00:08:01,00:08:04,When are you set to interview Ben?
124,00:08:04,00:08:07,You're the registered owner of a Lorcin .380.
125,00:08:07,00:08:10,Takes the same caliber bullet as the slugs we took out of the victim.
126,00:08:11,00:08:15,"So, I'm going to ask you one more time where's your gun?"
127,00:08:15,00:08:16,I lost it.
128,00:08:16,00:08:18,Do you think we believe that?
129,00:08:18,00:08:19,Do you think...
130,00:08:19,00:08:20,"Are you employed, Ben?"
131,00:08:20,00:08:22,"Yeah... yeah, um..."
132,00:08:22,00:08:27,it's a place called Dante's Pizzeria.
133,00:08:27,00:08:28,It's behind the Strato'.
134,00:08:28,00:08:30,You make pizzas?
135,00:08:30,00:08:32,"Well, I deliver the pizzas."
136,00:08:32,00:08:35,It's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff.
137,00:08:36,00:08:38,"Do you, uh..."
138,00:08:38,00:08:42,ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?
139,00:08:42,00:08:46,Mostly pizza boxes.
140,00:08:46,00:08:48,Why?
141,00:08:48,00:08:55,"Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza."
142,00:08:55,00:08:57,Can you explain that?
143,00:08:57,00:08:59,No.
144,00:08:59,00:09:06,"Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?"
145,00:09:06,00:09:08,"Well, I don't have to talk."
146,00:09:08,00:09:13,No... but we're going to figure it out.
147,00:09:13,00:09:16,"Look, if you know so much about these murders what do you need me for?"
148,00:09:16,00:09:18,Murders?
149,00:09:20,00:09:22,There are more bodies?
150,00:09:24,00:09:27,(background radio transmissions)
151,00:09:29,00:09:31,I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.
152,00:09:31,00:09:33,What is that? A beer can?
153,00:09:33,00:09:35,Soda can?
154,00:09:35,00:09:37,Zilch.
155,00:09:39,00:09:41,Zilch.
156,00:09:41,00:09:43,"Don't tell me, more zilch?"
157,00:09:43,00:09:45,SIDLE: Whoa... Whoa.
158,00:09:45,00:09:48,Point of disturbance.
159,00:09:48,00:09:49,Hold up.
160,00:09:52,00:09:54,STOKES: Isolate it.
161,00:10:18,00:10:21,Any more bodies you want to tell me about?
162,00:10:23,00:10:26,No.
163,00:10:26,00:10:29,We're going to radar this whole hillside.
164,00:10:33,00:10:50,Sometimes... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body I sit in my car and it hits me-- how close I was...
165,00:10:50,00:10:55,how heavy the body is...
166,00:10:55,00:10:58,the texture of the body...
167,00:10:58,00:11:01,how it feels... you know?
168,00:11:09,00:11:11,Mr. Grissom...
169,00:11:14,00:11:17,I'm not a bad person.
170,00:11:17,00:11:19,You're not a bad person?
171,00:11:21,00:11:22,"Then, what are you?"
172,00:11:32,00:11:36,"Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa."
173,00:11:36,00:11:37,"Yep, she's next."
174,00:11:37,00:11:38,"Well, it's about time."
175,00:11:38,00:11:40,"You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?"
176,00:11:40,00:11:43,I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.
177,00:11:43,00:11:46,"Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't."
178,00:11:46,00:11:48,"I'll take it from here, David."
179,00:11:48,00:11:50,Good morning.
180,00:11:50,00:11:52,Catherine.
181,00:11:52,00:11:56,No serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose.
182,00:11:56,00:11:57,She didn't drown?
183,00:11:57,00:12:00,Rules out your Jacuzzi theory.
184,00:12:00,00:12:02,Anything probative?
185,00:12:02,00:12:05,Bright red lividity extending down the body.
186,00:12:05,00:12:06,From?
187,00:12:06,00:12:08,"Well, heatstroke possibly."
188,00:12:08,00:12:12,Stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if I'm right...
189,00:12:12,00:12:14,Cover-up.
190,00:12:14,00:12:17,"Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine?"
191,00:12:17,00:12:21,"Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa-- a warrant, if we need it."
192,00:12:22,00:12:23,"Yep, that's right."
193,00:12:23,00:12:25,Bye.
194,00:12:25,00:12:26,"Oh, it's on."
195,00:12:26,00:12:29,Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?
196,00:12:29,00:12:31,"Uh, yeah."
197,00:12:31,00:12:33,Tina... Tina Kolas.
198,00:12:33,00:12:35,"Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana."
199,00:12:35,00:12:36,Flew here in a package. Why?
200,00:12:36,00:12:39,We need someone to give us the truth about last night.
201,00:12:49,00:12:51,Gil Grissom?
202,00:12:51,00:12:53,Father?
203,00:12:53,00:12:55,Benjamin's a member of my parish.
204,00:12:55,00:12:56,The officer won't let me talk to him.
205,00:12:56,00:12:58,He said you were in charge.
206,00:12:58,00:13:00,Of this crime scene.
207,00:13:00,00:13:02,He needs spiritual guidance.
208,00:13:08,00:13:10,"Yeah, I imagine he does."
209,00:13:10,00:13:14,Ah... then you'd have no problem with my talking to him.
210,00:13:14,00:13:15,It's the 11th hour.
211,00:13:15,00:13:17,I wouldn't expect anything less. 11th hour?
212,00:13:17,00:13:21,When the reality of their actions set in they usually turn to religion.
213,00:13:21,00:13:23,Can you think of a better time?
214,00:13:31,00:13:33,"Okay, hold it."
215,00:13:33,00:13:34,That's enough.
216,00:13:34,00:13:35,Let's dust him.
217,00:13:52,00:13:54,No ligature marks.
218,00:13:54,00:13:56,SIDLE: Different from the first guy.
219,00:13:56,00:14:01,See if this laceration on this guy's forehead is consistent with the kid's shovel.
220,00:14:03,00:14:05,Hey...
221,00:14:05,00:14:06,I feel a wallet here.
222,00:14:12,00:14:15,Ramirez Kenny.
223,00:14:15,00:14:18,A 25-year-old Latino and a 42-year-old white guy?
224,00:14:18,00:14:20,SIDLE: Strangers.
225,00:14:20,00:14:22,Doesn't make sense. There's no connection.
226,00:14:22,00:14:25,"Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery."
227,00:14:25,00:14:27,"STOKES: Hey, O'Riley."
228,00:14:27,00:14:29,"What's the matter, man-- A.C. not working?"
229,00:14:29,00:14:30,I was on with Dispatch.
230,00:14:30,00:14:36,Oliver Dunne's car was just found by the Highway Patrol abandoned at an AvCon station off 215.
231,00:14:36,00:14:41,"They didn't happen to find another car there, did they?"
232,00:14:41,00:14:43,Yeah.
233,00:14:43,00:14:49,"Registered to a ""Ramirez."" Yeah... gas station."
234,00:14:58,00:15:05,WILLOWS: And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night she was going to use the dry sauna?
235,00:15:05,00:15:07,We'd been drinking apple martinis for three days straight.
236,00:15:07,00:15:10,"Shelley said the sauna would detox her you know, clean her out."
237,00:15:14,00:15:15,Cath.
238,00:15:17,00:15:18,Whose shirt is this?
239,00:15:18,00:15:21,Mine. Shelley and I got in a fight over it.
240,00:15:21,00:15:22,When?
241,00:15:22,00:15:23,Yesterday.
242,00:15:23,00:15:31,"I caught her trying it on and I said ""Give it back,"" and then we started fighting over it, you know, tug of war and the whole thing ripped right in two."
243,00:15:31,00:15:32,We fell back laughing.
244,00:15:32,00:15:34,(laughing and squealing)
245,00:15:35,00:15:37,I'd give anything to have her back.
246,00:15:37,00:15:41,"We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind."
247,00:15:41,00:15:43,"No, go ahead, if it'll help."
248,00:15:43,00:15:46,You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.
249,00:15:46,00:15:48,She called down from this phone.
250,00:15:48,00:15:50,Do they tape phone calls here?
251,00:15:50,00:15:52,WILLOWS: Hotel surveillance would love that.
252,00:15:52,00:15:55,You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?
253,00:15:55,00:15:56,Yeah.
254,00:16:00,00:16:02,We're going to take this as well.
255,00:16:02,00:16:05,Okay... but it doesn't have anything on it.
256,00:16:05,00:16:07,"Well, that's okay."
257,00:16:07,00:16:08,We do magic.
258,00:16:10,00:16:13,Two men were shot and killed and you didn't see anything?
259,00:16:13,00:16:14,Sorry.
260,00:16:14,00:16:17,You don't just miss something like that. What was going on?
261,00:16:17,00:16:19,A friend of mine came with his new car.
262,00:16:19,00:16:21,We took it for a drive.
263,00:16:21,00:16:22,I'm afraid my boss will find out.
264,00:16:22,00:16:23,I was only gone five minutes.
265,00:16:24,00:16:25,"Okay, all right."
266,00:16:25,00:16:26,Just walk us through it.
267,00:16:26,00:16:28,When did you know there'd been a crime committed?
268,00:16:29,00:16:33,"Well, my buddy dropped me back here and I noticed these two cars."
269,00:16:33,00:16:35,I went to check them out.
270,00:16:43,00:16:45,"Oh, my God."
271,00:16:49,00:16:50,I don't see any blood.
272,00:16:50,00:16:51,"Yeah, I hosed it down."
273,00:16:51,00:16:52,You what?
274,00:16:52,00:16:53,It was freakin' me out.
275,00:17:04,00:17:06,H-Hello?
276,00:17:06,00:17:07,Mr. Grissom?
277,00:17:07,00:17:09,Uh...
278,00:17:11,00:17:14,They told me out front I'd find you here.
279,00:17:18,00:17:20,"I don't see your, uh... visitor's badge."
280,00:17:21,00:17:22,Priest's collar.
281,00:17:22,00:17:24,People trust it.
282,00:17:25,00:17:27,Most people.
283,00:17:27,00:17:29,Even lapsed Catholics.
284,00:17:29,00:17:34,"What makes you think, uh... I was ever a Catholic?"
285,00:17:34,00:17:37,"First time we met, you called me ""Father."" Only Romans do that."
286,00:17:38,00:17:45,"Everybody else, it's ""Reverend"" or ""Minister."" I wanted to know how your investigation against Ben is going."
287,00:17:45,00:17:46,This is his car.
288,00:17:47,00:17:49,"You know, you really shouldn't be here."
289,00:17:49,00:17:52,I didn't come here to tamper with your evidence.
290,00:18:03,00:18:06,"He was a good kid, all through school."
291,00:18:06,00:18:11,Still comes to Mass every Sunday.
292,00:18:11,00:18:14,If he has a problem...
293,00:18:14,00:18:15,it's trying to please people.
294,00:18:17,00:18:19,Is that a problem?
295,00:18:19,00:18:20,It can be.
296,00:18:31,00:18:34,This Luminol reveals any dried blood spots.
297,00:18:56,00:18:58,He wouldn't do this.
298,00:18:59,00:19:01,I believe the car.
299,00:19:04,00:19:15,"""To whom much is given, much will be expected."" I leave you to your work."
300,00:19:22,00:19:26,I told you we have no record Shelley Danvers specifically used the dry sauna.
301,00:19:26,00:19:28,"WILLOWS: That's okay, 'cause we do."
302,00:19:28,00:19:33,ESDA can read this blank paper see what's written on it.
303,00:19:33,00:19:34,Up to 14 layers.
304,00:19:34,00:19:37,BROWN: Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.
305,00:19:39,00:19:41,That's Miss Danvers' handwriting.
306,00:19:41,00:19:42,We confirm that.
307,00:19:42,00:19:43,So she took a dry sauna.
308,00:19:43,00:19:44,What does that prove?
309,00:19:44,00:19:48,She died of a heat stroke.
310,00:19:48,00:19:52,The Coroner just called in with the results of his final post.
311,00:19:52,00:19:56,Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke-- 182 °F.
312,00:19:58,00:20:01,That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.
313,00:20:01,00:20:03,Especially if no one checks up on them.
314,00:20:03,00:20:07,A hotel employee is supposed to check on the various saunas every 15 minutes.
315,00:20:07,00:20:09,"Hotel regulations, right?"
316,00:20:10,00:20:16,"We, uh, we got a copy of the check-up sheet."
317,00:20:17,00:20:23,No hotel employee checked in on the sauna after 7:30 p.m.
318,00:20:23,00:20:25,"So, Shelley was in here from 8:00 until..."
319,00:20:25,00:20:27,what time did you call 9-1-1?
320,00:20:31,00:20:32,"I, um..."
321,00:20:32,00:20:33,I came in at closing.
322,00:20:33,00:20:34,10:00.
323,00:20:34,00:20:37,Miss?
324,00:20:37,00:20:38,Miss?
325,00:20:38,00:20:39,"Oh, my God."
326,00:20:39,00:20:41,You moved her into the locker room?
327,00:20:42,00:20:43,Put the robe on her?
328,00:20:43,00:20:46,I was just trying to protect the hotel.
329,00:20:46,00:20:48,From negligent homicide.
330,00:20:48,00:20:53,They drill into us that the reputation of this hotel is everything.
331,00:20:53,00:20:55,Murder scene was compromised.
332,00:20:55,00:21:02,Pump jockey wasn't very helpful but bullets pulled from Victim One and Victim Two.
333,00:21:02,00:21:03,Identical striations.
334,00:21:03,00:21:06,Bullets in both victims were fired by the exact same weapon.
335,00:21:06,00:21:07,A Lorcin .380.
336,00:21:07,00:21:11,The same pistol registered to a Benjamin Jennings.
337,00:21:11,00:21:16,SIDLE: P.D. can prove through credit cards that Ben frequents the AvCon gas stations where both vics were killed.
338,00:21:16,00:21:20,STOKES: And we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found.
339,00:21:20,00:21:21,And fibers.
340,00:21:23,00:21:27,I recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of Victim One.
341,00:21:27,00:21:29,Found the same fiber on the sock of Victim Two.
342,00:21:29,00:21:33,We ID'd the fibers using the FTIR.
343,00:21:33,00:21:35,It's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting.
344,00:21:35,00:21:37,So we went back to Ben's car.
345,00:21:40,00:21:42,STOKES: They're identical.
346,00:21:42,00:21:44,We got the Master Standards from the car manufacturer.
347,00:21:44,00:21:53,"The assigned name for the material is ""12-ounce Merlot Trialon."" Bottom line... he killed them."
348,00:21:53,00:21:56,"Good work, you guys."
349,00:21:56,00:22:00,Very good.
350,00:22:00,00:22:02,But you haven't proved murder.
351,00:22:02,00:22:03,You've proved burial.
352,00:22:03,00:22:05,Excuse me?
353,00:22:05,00:22:07,Victim blood on his clothes...
354,00:22:08,00:22:09,under his nails.
355,00:22:09,00:22:11,From burying them.
356,00:22:11,00:22:14,Victim blood in his car?
357,00:22:14,00:22:16,He transported them.
358,00:22:17,00:22:20,Show me the gun with Ben's prints on it.
359,00:22:20,00:22:23,"Gun shot residue, the ligature, the..."
360,00:22:23,00:22:26,"The holes in Christ's hands, Doubting Thomas?"
361,00:22:26,00:22:28,Yes. Empirical evidence.
362,00:22:28,00:22:31,St. Thomas was ahead of us all.
363,00:22:31,00:22:36,Does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here?
364,00:22:36,00:22:37,No.
365,00:22:37,00:22:40,It has to do with the evidence.
366,00:22:40,00:22:43,It's our job to present the D.A. with the best evidence possible.
367,00:22:43,00:22:44,Let a jury decide.
368,00:22:44,00:22:47,"Anything else, we're playing judge."
369,00:22:47,00:22:51,The evidence doesn't get any better than this.
370,00:23:00,00:23:01,Okay. Ship it.
371,00:23:01,00:23:02,Show it to the D.A.
372,00:23:03,00:23:06,Right.
373,00:23:12,00:23:13,Anyone up for breakfast?
374,00:23:13,00:23:16,I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.
375,00:23:16,00:23:19,Football-- wide-screen.
376,00:23:19,00:23:21,"Well, I guess I'll go see Tina alone."
377,00:23:22,00:23:25,Hotel tells me she's down playing quarter slots.
378,00:23:27,00:23:29,I thought we solved this case.
379,00:23:29,00:23:30,What'd you get?
380,00:23:30,00:23:37,"Well, my guy in the hotel lounge tells me that Tina and Shelley were having a catfight over some dude named Jeremy the day she died."
381,00:23:37,00:23:41,That's probably how the shirt really got ripped.
382,00:23:41,00:23:44,Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.
383,00:23:44,00:23:46,Misunderstood the priest?
384,00:23:46,00:23:48,How?
385,00:23:48,00:23:50,I looked deeper into the evidence.
386,00:23:50,00:23:52,I should have looked deeper into Ben's character.
387,00:23:52,00:23:56,"STOKES: ""Benjamin Corey Jennings."" Nonviolent crimes."
388,00:23:58,00:24:01,"""Roger Jennings... armed robbery."
389,00:24:01,00:24:07,"""Past convictions, breaking and entering ""assault with great bodily harm."
390,00:24:07,00:24:12,"Paroled 9/27/2000."" This guy is hard-core."
391,00:24:12,00:24:14,He's looking at his third strike here.
392,00:24:17,00:24:19,What's going on?
393,00:24:23,00:24:25,You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?
394,00:24:25,00:24:26,Yeah.
395,00:24:26,00:24:29,We might have been wrong.
396,00:24:29,00:24:31,Tell me about your brother.
397,00:24:36,00:24:38,We know that you only buried the bodies.
398,00:24:38,00:24:41,"So, what happened?"
399,00:24:43,00:24:45,Did he threaten you?
400,00:24:49,00:24:51,Ben?
401,00:25:11,00:25:13,"Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison, Roger?"
402,00:25:16,00:25:19,Who the hell are you guys?
403,00:25:19,00:25:21,Get out of my kitchen.
404,00:25:21,00:25:28,"""Roger Jennings-- armed robbery, breaking and entering."" You sound like the kind of guy it wouldn't be a big jump to murder."
405,00:25:29,00:25:30,What is this?
406,00:25:32,00:25:34,Your first stop the AvCon gas station.
407,00:25:34,00:25:35,See these two guys?
408,00:25:35,00:25:37,Nope.
409,00:25:37,00:25:40,Don't know what you're talking about.
410,00:25:40,00:25:42,My little brother got me this job.
411,00:25:42,00:25:43,I'm staying clean.
412,00:25:43,00:25:46,Suppose I told you your brother said you did these guys.
413,00:25:49,00:25:51,He wouldn't do that.
414,00:25:51,00:26:00,You did it directly after work using a .380 pistol and then you strangled one of the victims with his own tie.
415,00:26:12,00:26:14,Ben did it.
416,00:26:15,00:26:16,Did you witness this?
417,00:26:16,00:26:19,He told me about it.
418,00:26:19,00:26:21,Look what I did-- I just lost my head.
419,00:26:22,00:26:23,What am I supposed to do now?
420,00:26:23,00:26:26,"I'm on a short line, all right?"
421,00:26:26,00:26:27,"You're on your own, Ben."
422,00:26:28,00:26:29,"Roger, you've got to help me."
423,00:26:29,00:26:30,You know I can't.
424,00:26:30,00:26:31,What am I going to do?
425,00:26:31,00:26:32,Huh?
426,00:26:32,00:26:33,It's your mess.
427,00:26:33,00:26:34,You got to deal with it.
428,00:26:34,00:26:37,What started the beef with the victims?
429,00:26:37,00:26:38,I don't know.
430,00:26:38,00:26:40,"Tempers, I guess."
431,00:26:42,00:26:43,Hey!
432,00:26:43,00:26:45,"Hey, man! I was here first."
433,00:26:45,00:26:46,You want to wait your turn?
434,00:26:46,00:26:48,"What are you going to do, huh?"
435,00:26:51,00:26:53,Bystander gets a little too nosy...
436,00:26:57,00:26:59,"and he gets it, too."
437,00:27:01,00:27:04,The perpetrator's hands left flour on the victim's face.
438,00:27:04,00:27:06,This was not from a gunshot.
439,00:27:06,00:27:09,This was something a little more intimate.
440,00:27:20,00:27:30,When a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one of two reasons-- entertainment... or necessity.
441,00:27:30,00:27:32,Which was it for you?
442,00:27:32,00:27:33,Neither.
443,00:27:33,00:27:36,"I told you, Ben strangled that guy."
444,00:27:36,00:27:38,The flour said you did.
445,00:27:40,00:27:42,I don't know what you're talking about.
446,00:27:43,00:27:46,Anything on the list besides the tie?
447,00:27:46,00:27:48,Nope.
448,00:27:50,00:27:52,"Hey, guys."
449,00:27:52,00:27:53,You can go ahead and take off.
450,00:27:53,00:27:54,I think we got it.
451,00:27:54,00:27:55,Thanks.
452,00:28:02,00:28:03,Whoa.
453,00:28:18,00:28:19,Hey.
454,00:28:19,00:28:21,Dry cleaning.
455,00:28:21,00:28:22,The trailer's low-rent.
456,00:28:22,00:28:24,Dry cleaning's expensive.
457,00:28:36,00:28:38,Sara?
458,00:28:38,00:28:40,This man's not as smart as he thinks.
459,00:28:40,00:28:42,Dry cleaning bakes in blood stains.
460,00:28:44,00:28:45,Could be red sauce.
461,00:28:45,00:28:46,"Oh, now you're cautious."
462,00:28:46,00:28:49,I'm just trying to put our mistake to good use.
463,00:28:49,00:28:52,Okay. You wanna...
464,00:28:52,00:28:56,check the perimeter and I'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce.
465,00:28:56,00:28:57,Okay.
466,00:30:10,00:30:11,Hemoglobin.
467,00:30:11,00:30:13,Take a look at this.
468,00:30:19,00:30:20,Nick?
469,00:30:22,00:30:24,"Hey, Nick."
470,00:30:59,00:31:00,(gunshot)
471,00:31:01,00:31:03,(gunshots)
472,00:31:07,00:31:09,"jammed, huh?"
473,00:31:09,00:31:11,Get anything instructive?
474,00:31:11,00:31:12,Possibly.
475,00:31:13,00:31:14,Blood from Jennings's denim shirt.
476,00:31:19,00:31:20,Is the printer out of ink?
477,00:31:20,00:31:28,"""ND, ND, ND."" It means ""None Detected."" The dry cleaning baked in the blood and it also degraded it to a degree that I can't get a result."
478,00:31:28,00:31:31,Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.
479,00:31:31,00:31:32,I have tried.
480,00:31:32,00:31:33,"It's chemically impossible, Sara."
481,00:31:33,00:31:35,Nothing from nothing is nothing.
482,00:31:42,00:31:45,The striations are different. See?
483,00:31:47,00:31:52,There's no way I can say that the bullets taken from the victims were fired by Jennings's gun.
484,00:31:54,00:31:56,"So, he altered the barrel somehow."
485,00:31:56,00:32:03,"Yeah. Changed how the bullet relates to the barrel so when the bullet emerges, its fine stria are altered."
486,00:32:03,00:32:05,Any idea what he used?
487,00:32:07,00:32:09,Whatever it was...
488,00:32:09,00:32:10,did the job.
489,00:32:10,00:32:11,My evidence is no better.
490,00:32:11,00:32:13,Total wash.
491,00:32:16,00:32:18,We present this to the D.A.
492,00:32:18,00:32:22,"Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before."
493,00:32:22,00:32:23,The guilty brother's going to walk.
494,00:32:56,00:32:59,He's never been in any real trouble before.
495,00:33:00,00:33:01,They'll go easy on him.
496,00:33:06,00:33:08,"The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?"
497,00:33:18,00:33:21,"So, itwasnecessity."
498,00:33:33,00:33:36,"Wait, are you saying Shelley didn't die in the sauna?"
499,00:33:36,00:33:37,She died of heat stroke.
500,00:33:37,00:33:41,But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.
501,00:33:41,00:33:42,Like what?
502,00:33:42,00:33:43,Shell was always healthy.
503,00:33:44,00:33:45,She went into anaphylactic shock.
504,00:33:45,00:33:52,"Coroner says some of the indicators are the same as a stroke: renal failure, cerebral edema."
505,00:33:52,00:33:57,We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.
506,00:33:57,00:33:59,I don't understand.
507,00:33:59,00:34:03,"Well, maybe this will help-- the travel agency contract you and Shelley signed."
508,00:34:03,00:34:07,"Under ""allergic reactions to foods"" for Shelley Danvers-- shellfish."
509,00:34:07,00:34:09,"As her best friend, you would know that."
510,00:34:09,00:34:27,"BRASS: And then we have this from the hotel computer for your room 7:01 p.m., on the day: ""A Taste from the Sea ""a lovely tureen of mild bisque with pureed bits of Maine lobster."" Pureed, two bowls."
511,00:34:27,00:34:31,"She didn't know what she was eating when it arrived, did she?"
512,00:34:33,00:34:36,Because she didn't order it; you did.
513,00:34:39,00:34:46,We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints.
514,00:34:46,00:34:48,"Well, the machine isolated this."
515,00:34:49,00:34:53,"""Jeremy, drinks, 10:00."" Shelley made that date."
516,00:34:53,00:34:54,That's her handwriting.
517,00:34:55,00:34:58,Were you in the room when Jeremy called?
518,00:34:58,00:35:00,I answered the phone.
519,00:35:00,00:35:02,He asked for her.
520,00:35:02,00:35:05,You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?
521,00:35:05,00:35:07,I didn't mean to kill her.
522,00:35:07,00:35:14,"I thought that she would just have an allergic reaction and she wouldn't be able to make her date that night like, get hives or something."
523,00:35:14,00:35:25,"Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions-- trachea... larynx... tongue swelled."
524,00:35:25,00:35:30,Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs.
525,00:35:30,00:35:32,They shut down.
526,00:35:37,00:35:39,I didn't even like the guy.
527,00:35:39,00:35:44,I just... I didn't want to be left out.
528,00:35:48,00:35:52,"BRASS: Miss Kolas, you're under arrest."
529,00:35:52,00:35:55,Hey.
530,00:35:55,00:35:56,D.A.'s looking for you.
531,00:35:56,00:35:59,"About? What, you think I read your messages?"
532,00:36:00,00:36:03,"""Top secret and urgent""?"
533,00:36:03,00:36:04,"It's a gift, reading upside down."
534,00:36:04,00:36:06,The Las Vegas District Attorney is reportedly...
535,00:36:06,00:36:08,preparing to file homicide charges...
536,00:36:08,00:36:13,against Benjamin Corey Jennings in the so-called Burial Murders case.
537,00:36:13,00:36:16,Jennings has been in police custody for the last...
538,00:36:16,00:36:18,Guess we know what she was calling about.
539,00:36:18,00:36:23,"...since he was caught burying the first victim, Oliver Dunne in the National Forest."
540,00:36:23,00:36:28,Don't you have enough cases over at CSI now you're going to start telling me which ones I should take to court?
541,00:36:28,00:36:32,There isn't one piece of evidence that says that kid was even present at the murders.
542,00:36:32,00:36:34,As a matter of fact this is why I was hunting you.
543,00:36:34,00:36:37,Jennings brought it in about an hour ago.
544,00:36:37,00:36:39,Chain of custody; I can't touch it.
545,00:36:40,00:36:42,"The first victim was ligatured, right?"
546,00:36:51,00:36:54,Jennings says his little brother asked him to hide the tie.
547,00:36:54,00:36:55,"Well, how convenient."
548,00:36:55,00:37:01,The older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over the murder weapon.
549,00:37:01,00:37:04,"A jury doesn't understand epi-whatevers, okay?"
550,00:37:04,00:37:09,They understand a twisty tie and blood all over Ben's car seat.
551,00:37:09,00:37:10,He set up his brother.
552,00:37:10,00:37:14,"Oh, come on, Grissom, they're both part of it and if I can get one of them, I will."
553,00:37:14,00:37:15,"He's a good kid, Robin."
554,00:37:15,00:37:18,"He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid."
555,00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah?
556,00:37:19,00:37:22,Then his epithelials shouldn't be on that tie.
557,00:37:24,00:37:31,Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim.
558,00:37:31,00:37:32,I don't know.
559,00:37:32,00:37:36,Your brother brought this in to the District Attorney.
560,00:37:40,00:37:42,What?
561,00:37:42,00:37:43,He's framing you.
562,00:37:43,00:37:49,GRISSOM: Unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie.
563,00:37:49,00:37:52,I don't know.
564,00:37:52,00:37:54,I swear I don't know.
565,00:37:54,00:37:57,I... he... I just picked up the bodies at his place.
566,00:37:59,00:38:00,"Grab that guy's tie, little bro."
567,00:38:00,00:38:02,I like that thing.
568,00:38:08,00:38:10,"Bury them deep, all right?"
569,00:38:10,00:38:14,"You get into any trouble you don't have to say anything, all right?"
570,00:38:14,00:38:15,I'm counting on you.
571,00:38:15,00:38:18,"Yeah, yeah, man, I'm there all the way."
572,00:38:18,00:38:21,"Go, get out of here."
573,00:38:21,00:38:23,Go on.
574,00:38:24,00:38:26,I got to ask...
575,00:38:26,00:38:30,how does somebody bury two bodies as a favor?
576,00:38:30,00:38:32,'Cause he's my brother.
577,00:38:33,00:38:37,He told... He told me that if I didn't talk...
578,00:38:37,00:38:41,"to you guys and if he didn't talk, then this would all just blow over; it'd all just go away."
579,00:38:41,00:38:45,You're looking at two counts of Murder Special Circumstances.
580,00:38:45,00:38:50,The best you can hope for is life without parole.
581,00:38:50,00:38:53,I don't... I don't think I can do that kind of time.
582,00:38:55,00:39:00,Do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders?
583,00:39:00,00:39:01,Anything?
584,00:39:57,00:40:00,I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.
585,00:40:07,00:40:09,He came to see you as soon as Ben was in custody.
586,00:40:12,00:40:16,I tried to help without breaking my vows.
587,00:40:20,00:40:24,We both have jobs that begin after the crime.
588,00:40:24,00:40:27,After the sin.
589,00:40:27,00:40:31,Some people would call that a career in futility.
590,00:40:31,00:40:34,Some call it a vocation.
591,00:40:37,00:40:42,100 years ago we didn't have the technology for fingerprints.
592,00:40:42,00:40:44,"15 years ago, we didn't have DNA."
593,00:40:44,00:40:52,"Hopefully one day, we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail in this case."
594,00:40:52,00:40:55,"Someday, we won't need jails."
595,00:40:58,00:41:02,"I celebrate mass every Thursday night, 7:00."
596,00:41:04,00:41:07,Thank you...
597,00:41:07,00:41:10,but...
598,00:41:10,00:41:12,no.
599,00:41:12,00:41:15,You don't believe?
600,00:41:15,00:41:18,In religion?
601,00:41:18,00:41:21,"I believe in God, in science..."
602,00:41:21,00:41:23,in Sunday supper.
603,00:41:23,00:41:27,I don't believe in rules that tell me how I should live.
604,00:41:27,00:41:30,Even if they're handed down by God?
605,00:41:30,00:41:32,How many crusades were fought in the name of God?
606,00:41:32,00:41:36,How many people died because of someone's religion?
607,00:41:36,00:41:39,Fanaticism; not religion.
608,00:41:39,00:41:41,Semantics.
609,00:41:41,00:41:43,They're still dead.
610,00:41:44,00:41:47,"I'm sorry about Ben, Father."
611,00:41:50,00:41:53,You still suffer like a Catholic.
612,00:41:56,00:42:00,"Light bulb goes out other people fix it, get a new one."
613,00:42:00,00:42:12,"Light bulb goes out for the Catholic he stands in the dark says, ""What did I do wrong?"" That guilt's not in me anymore."
614,00:42:28,00:42:29,Hey.
615,00:42:29,00:42:30,Oh.
616,00:42:31,00:42:35,You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.
617,00:42:35,00:42:38,Spa safety?
618,00:42:38,00:42:42,We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean.
619,00:42:42,00:42:46,Some foul play; some negligence.
620,00:42:46,00:42:48,So what am I supposed to say?
621,00:42:48,00:42:50,That it was an isolated incident...
622,00:42:50,00:42:55,that in no way should it be a mark against the Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.
623,00:42:55,00:42:58,CSI supports Las Vegas.
624,00:42:58,00:42:59,Bottom line.
625,00:43:07,00:43:09,Need some help in here!
626,00:43:15,00:43:16,Hold his head! Hold his head!
627,00:43:16,00:43:18,I can't stop the bleeding.
628,00:43:18,00:43:20,"Oh, no, no, no."
629,00:43:20,00:43:21,How did this happen?!
630,00:43:21,00:43:23,Incisor. He used his teeth.
631,00:43:23,00:43:24,Clamp down.
632,00:43:26,00:43:27,Keep him with us.
633,00:43:27,00:43:28,Get out of the way!
634,00:43:28,00:43:30,"Out of the way! Sir, step back."
635,00:43:30,00:43:32,Sir. He's bleeding out.
636,00:43:32,00:43:33,He's bleeding out here.
637,00:43:33,00:43:35,We need to stop this.
638,00:43:35,00:43:37,Compression. Keep him with us.
639,00:43:37,00:43:38,Get the head up.
640,00:43:38,00:43:41,"We're losing him, we're losing him."
641,00:43:46,00:43:49,I'm going to pronounce. 22:04.
