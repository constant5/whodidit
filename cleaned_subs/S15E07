0	00:01:32	00:01:33	All right, fellas.
1	00:01:37	00:01:41	Well, looks like somebody went for a little skinny-dip, and things didn't go so well last night, huh? Thanks, boys.
2	00:01:41	00:01:44	House has been on the market for a couple months.
3	00:01:44	00:01:45	Just been sitting here vacant.
4	00:01:45	00:01:50	Neighbors say they see kids hop the fence, use the pool, all the time.
5	00:01:50	00:01:52	But nobody saw anything last night?
6	00:01:52	00:01:54	Right.
7	00:01:54	00:01:57	Hey, Akers, do we even know who she is, yet?
8	00:01:57	00:01:58	No, not yet. There's no I.D.
9	00:01:58	00:02:00	There's no car out front. We knocked on doors.
10	00:02:00	00:02:02	She's not from the neighborhood.
11	00:02:02	00:02:04	She got here somehow.
12	00:02:04	00:02:06	Maybe she came with a friend, and that friend took off.
13	00:02:06	00:02:09	I don't know if friend, is the word I'd use.
14	00:02:09	00:02:13	There are bruises, looks like finger marks, on her neck.
15	00:02:13	00:02:15	Take a look at this.
16	00:02:15	00:02:18	Got skin underneath her fingernails.
17	00:02:18	00:02:19	She struggled.
18	00:02:19	00:02:21	Possibly while being held under water.
19	00:02:23	00:02:26	Yeah, hang-hang on a second.
20	00:02:26	00:02:29	Greg, let me borrow your mini-UV for a second.
21	00:02:31	00:02:32	Hold up that wrist for me. Yeah, yeah.
22	00:02:35	00:02:36	There we go, Greg, look at that.
23	00:02:38	00:02:40	Club bracelets and hand stamps.
24	00:02:40	00:02:43	Well, party didn't start here.
25	00:02:43	00:02:45	Looks like she made the rounds last night.
26	00:02:45	00:02:47	Partied like there was no tomorrow.
27	00:02:47	00:02:50	Unfortunately for her, she was right.
28	00:03:32	00:03:35	So, this is our party girl.
29	00:03:35	00:03:37	Wow, she's so young.
30	00:03:37	00:03:38	What a waste.
31	00:03:38	00:03:41	Did you collect a sexual assault kit?
32	00:03:41	00:03:45	Yes, evidence of recent sexual activity.
33	00:03:45	00:03:48	Can't say for certain that it was forced, but it was certainly aggressive.
34	00:03:48	00:03:51	No semen, though. Doesn't rule out rape.
35	00:03:51	00:03:54	Just means that her attacker was smart enough to use a condom.
36	00:03:54	00:03:56	Any clue who she might be, yet?
37	00:03:56	00:03:58	Still a Jane Doe.
38	00:03:58	00:04:01	But... trashy clothes, lots of costume jewelry.
39	00:04:01	00:04:03	May have been a sex worker.
40	00:04:03	00:04:05	You don't know much about women's clothes, huh?
41	00:04:05	00:04:09	These trashy shoes go for about, uh, 1,200 bucks.
42	00:04:09	00:04:10	What?
43	00:04:10	00:04:12	Yep.
44	00:04:12	00:04:13	And this... yeah.
45	00:04:13	00:04:15	I saw that upstairs at the Mediterranean.
46	00:04:15	00:04:17	Two grand, on sale.
47	00:04:17	00:04:18	For that little thing?
48	00:04:18	00:04:19	Yeah, this girl had a lot of money.
49	00:04:20	00:04:22	Yeah, or somebody willing to spend it on her.
50	00:04:23	00:04:24	Well, uh, if that's the case...
51	00:04:26	00:04:27	...this thing might actually be real.
52	00:04:28	00:04:29	Wow.
53	00:04:29	00:04:32	That is a very big rock.
54	00:04:32	00:04:36	It's probably insured, which means it might have a serial number etched on it.
55	00:04:36	00:04:38	It's real, all right.
56	00:04:38	00:04:39	Nearly flawless.
57	00:04:39	00:04:41	Yeah?
58	00:04:41	00:04:42	How big is it?
59	00:04:42	00:04:44	Well, now, I thought size doesn't matter.
60	00:04:44	00:04:45	Well, you thought wrong.
61	00:04:45	00:04:46	Come on, how big?
62	00:04:46	00:04:47	It's nearly four karats.
63	00:04:47	00:04:48	Wow.
64	00:04:48	00:04:50	I don't see any etching, though.
65	00:04:50	00:04:52	No serial number or I.D. markings.
66	00:04:52	00:04:54	So, it's not gonna help us I.D. our victim.
67	00:04:54	00:04:58	You know, there are other ways to identify a diamond these days.
68	00:05:00	00:05:02	There, see that?
69	00:05:02	00:05:04	You mean the refraction pattern?
70	00:05:04	00:05:05	Yeah.
71	00:05:05	00:05:07	That pattern is unique to that stone.
72	00:05:08	00:05:10	Like a fingerprint.
73	00:05:10	00:05:11	And it can be registered with an insurance database.
74	00:05:11	00:05:15	We just have to see if this particular pattern is in the system.
75	00:05:27	00:05:31	Diamond is registered to Martin Fox, St. George, Utah.
76	00:05:38	00:05:40	That's my wife.
77	00:05:40	00:05:44	You know, the whole drive down here, I was hoping it was just a mistake.
78	00:05:45	00:05:48	Who did this to her, Mr. Russell?
79	00:05:48	00:05:52	At this point in the investigation, we're not ready to name any suspects.
80	00:05:52	00:05:55	Can you at least tell me how it happened?
81	00:05:55	00:06:00	Mr. Fox, we need more time to study the evidence before we can actually...
82	00:06:00	00:06:01	She was wasted, though, wasn't she?
83	00:06:02	00:06:04	That much you know.
84	00:06:04	00:06:09	Your wife's blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit.
85	00:06:09	00:06:13	And there's evidence of several controlled substances in her system.
86	00:06:15	00:06:17	Was there a man involved?
87	00:06:18	00:06:20	Wouldn't be the first time.
88	00:06:20	00:06:22	Daycia didn't like to party alone.
89	00:06:23	00:06:28	Mr. Fox, I'm very sorry for your loss, but I-I'm not gonna give you any details here.
90	00:06:29	00:06:33	$8,000 a week.
91	00:06:33	00:06:34	She was supposed to be safe.
92	00:06:34	00:06:36	Hell, she was supposed to be getting better.
93	00:06:36	00:06:38	What-what was $8,000 a week?
94	00:06:38	00:06:41	Rehab.
95	00:06:41	00:06:44	Daycia was in rehab, here in Vegas.
96	00:06:44	00:06:45	Three weeks already.
97	00:07:02	00:07:03	This is rehab?
98	00:07:03	00:07:04	Seriously?
99	00:07:04	00:07:07	I'd be worried about getting addicted to living in a place like this.
100	00:07:07	00:07:09	Well, maybe that's the idea.
101	00:07:09	00:07:13	You spend so much to stay here, you don't have any money left to support your habit.
102	00:07:13	00:07:15	You know, I checked out their Web site.
103	00:07:15	00:07:19	They claim to have one of the highest success rates in the state.
104	00:07:19	00:07:19	Really?
105	00:07:19	00:07:25	Yeah, they're all about pampering you in a setting of luxury, harmony and serenity.
106	00:07:26	00:07:27	They seem to have that covered.
107	00:07:30	00:07:32	Don't tell me I don't care about my children, Zach.
108	00:07:32	00:07:34	They're the most important thing in my life.
109	00:07:34	00:07:34	Are they?
110	00:07:35	00:07:38	'Cause it sounds to me like you choose the pills over your kids every time.
111	00:07:38	00:07:40	Do I really have to sit here and listen to this?
112	00:07:40	00:07:44	From him? I know it's hard to hear what Zach has to say, Karen. But isn't that the heart of the problem?
113	00:07:44	00:07:47	The addiction takes over your whole life.
114	00:07:47	00:07:49	Pushes everything else out.
115	00:07:50	00:07:52	Or you could keep denying it. That's what I did.
116	00:07:52	00:07:57	Until divorce papers and the threat of losing my children opened my eyes.
117	00:08:00	00:08:01	I got it.
118	00:08:04	00:08:05	Hi there.
119	00:08:05	00:08:07	I'm CSI Stokes. This is Finlay.
120	00:08:07	00:08:09	We're with the police department.
121	00:08:09	00:08:12	We'd like to ask you a few questions if, uh, that's all right.
122	00:08:12	00:08:14	Oh, God, this is about Daycia, isn't it?
123	00:08:14	00:08:16	I'm sorry, who are you?
124	00:08:16	00:08:19	Adam King. I run Desert Peace.
125	00:08:19	00:08:21	Daycia disappeared, she never came home last night.
126	00:08:21	00:08:23	How bad is it?
127	00:08:23	00:08:25	It's as bad as it gets.
128	00:08:25	00:08:26	She's dead.
129	00:08:28	00:08:31	We're gonna have to take a break.
130	00:08:35	00:08:37	This was Daycia's room.
131	00:08:38	00:08:41	So...
132	00:08:41	00:08:44	this is what eight grand a week looks like.
133	00:08:44	00:08:53	Well, there's no reason that recovery should be a punitive process. We try to pamper our patients, make 'em feel as comfortable as possible.
134	00:08:53	00:08:55	And, hey, the longer they stay, the better, am I right?
135	00:08:55	00:08:58	In a clinical sense, yes.
136	00:08:58	00:09:01	But I get a feeling that's not what you're implying.
137	00:09:13	00:09:16	When was the last time you saw Daycia?
138	00:09:16	00:09:17	00 last night.
139	00:09:17	00:09:19	She was in the kitchen getting something to eat.
140	00:09:19	00:09:21	Must've ducked out sometime after that.
141	00:09:21	00:09:23	What do you mean, ducked out?
142	00:09:23	00:09:25	Is that typical of the care around here?
143	00:09:25	00:09:28	There's no such thing as typical care here at Desert Peace.
144	00:09:28	00:09:31	Each patient receives a personalized treatment plan.
145	00:09:31	00:09:36	And did Daycia have a personalized treatment plan that allowed her to go out and get wasted?
146	00:09:36	00:09:38	What would you have me do, Mr. Stokes?
147	00:09:38	00:09:42	Keep an eye on her, for one. They're not locked up-- patients are here by choice.
148	00:09:42	00:09:44	I can't force people to stay here.
149	00:09:44	00:09:46	Especially someone like Daycia.
150	00:09:46	00:09:48	What is that supposed to mean?
151	00:09:48	00:09:50	She was already skittish about getting clean.
152	00:09:50	00:09:58	If I'd have clamped down on her-- if I would have imposed restrictions-- she would've just checked herself out of here, and I would have had no chance at trying to help her.
153	00:09:58	00:10:00	And no chance at getting that eight grand.
154	00:10:00	00:10:05	So did anybody else duck out last night? Any of the other patients?
155	00:10:05	00:10:06	No.
156	00:10:06	00:10:09	Zach, Len and Karen were all here.
157	00:10:09	00:10:11	You know, they're committed to getting sober.
158	00:10:11	00:10:12	So you're saying that Daycia wasn't?
159	00:10:12	00:10:14	Daycia was here 'cause her husband put her here.
160	00:10:14	00:10:16	Not because she wanted to get better.
161	00:10:16	00:10:21	And I'm not saying that as a knock. I flunked out of six rehabs myself before I took getting sober seriously.
162	00:10:21	00:10:26	As a straight numbers game, most addicts end up like Daycia.
163	00:10:28	00:10:30	It's a hand stamp of a crown.
164	00:10:30	00:10:34	Can't you just tell me if you guys used a crown stamp last night?
165	00:10:35	00:10:38	How is that a proprietary secret?
166	00:10:38	00:10:39	(chuckles) Do you even know what proprietary means?
167	00:10:41	00:10:42	Hello?
168	00:10:42	00:10:45	That maybe didn't go as well as I might have liked.
169	00:10:45	00:10:48	Trying to figure out which clubs our victim was at last night?
170	00:10:48	00:10:50	So far, I have it narrowed down to four.
171	00:10:50	00:10:54	Beautiful young girl out by herself getting more and more impaired?
172	00:10:54	00:10:59	Truth is, the killer could have spotted her anywhere along the way and decided to follow her.
173	00:10:59	00:11:04	And the problem is, she went to so many places, who knows how many hundreds of people she met?
174	00:11:07	00:11:08	Hey. You got something for us?
175	00:11:08	00:11:12	I've been working on extracting the DNA from the tissue found under the victim's fingernails.
176	00:11:12	00:11:14	Please tell me you found a match.
177	00:11:14	00:11:20	I wish I could, but no-- the DNA in the sample was degraded, probably from soaking in the pool.
178	00:11:20	00:11:22	I was only able to type four loci.
179	00:11:22	00:11:23	It's not enough to enter into CODIS.
180	00:11:23	00:11:25	No CODIS match.
181	00:11:25	00:11:27	You've got your work cut out for you.
182	00:11:27	00:11:29	(chuckles) Yes, I do.
183	00:11:30	00:11:31	I started without you.
184	00:11:31	00:11:32	I hope you don't mind.
185	00:11:32	00:11:34	No problem.
186	00:11:34	00:11:37	Only reason I called down was to see if you'd found anything yet.
187	00:11:37	00:11:39	Well, so far, no surprises.
188	00:11:39	00:11:43	All indications are she was a longtime drinker and drug user.
189	00:11:43	00:11:48	As good as she looks on the outside, her insides paint a different picture.
190	00:11:48	00:11:51	Get a chance to look at the finger marks on the back of her neck? I did.
191	00:11:51	00:11:53	Definitely perimortem.
192	00:11:53	00:11:55	Consistent with someone holding her underwater.
193	00:11:55	00:11:58	Lungs tell the same story.
194	00:11:58	00:12:00	They're heavy.
195	00:12:01	00:12:03	They're filled with water.
196	00:12:03	00:12:05	Telltale sign she drowned.
197	00:12:08	00:12:12	Greg, the pool you found her in-- chlorine or saline?
198	00:12:12	00:12:14	Uh, it was chlorine. Why?
199	00:12:22	00:12:26	If you get any closer, you can literally be breathing down my neck.
200	00:12:26	00:12:27	You wish.
201	00:12:27	00:12:30	So, what is going on with the pool water from our victim's lungs?
202	00:12:30	00:12:32	Greg said that there was some sort of an issue.
203	00:12:32	00:12:34	I don't think that it is pool water.
204	00:12:34	00:12:38	Certainly doesn't match any of the samples that Nick brought in.
205	00:12:38	00:12:41	pH is about the same, but the chlorine level is far too low.
206	00:12:41	00:12:43	More in line with regular tap water.
207	00:12:43	00:12:45	What did the GCMS find?
208	00:12:45	00:12:46	Oh, perfect timing. (printer whirring)
209	00:12:46	00:12:47	Let's take a look.
210	00:12:51	00:12:56	Traces of sodium myreth sulfate, panthenol, methyl glycinate.
211	00:12:56	00:12:57	All ingredients in soap.
212	00:12:57	00:12:59	What is the organic oil?
213	00:12:59	00:13:02	Extract of Lavandula augustifolia.
214	00:13:03	00:13:04	Lavender.
215	00:13:05	00:13:08	The fluid in the victim's lungs was bathwater.
216	00:13:12	00:13:13	Yep.
217	00:13:13	00:13:17	The ingredients are an exact match to what was in the water in her lungs.
218	00:13:17	00:13:19	You guys can't just come barging in here.
219	00:13:19	00:13:21	Yeah, that warrant in your hand says we can.
220	00:13:21	00:13:22	We have every right in the world to search the crime scene.
221	00:13:22	00:13:23	Crime scene?
222	00:13:23	00:13:25	What are you talking about?
223	00:13:25	00:13:27	Daycia did not drown in any pool.
224	00:13:27	00:13:29	She was killed right here.
225	00:13:41	00:13:43	Hi.
226	00:13:43	00:13:44	So, I've been calling cab companies.
227	00:13:44	00:13:49	Talked to a dispatcher who's got a driver who dropped off a fare last night at this address.
228	00:13:49	00:13:51	00 a.m.
229	00:13:51	00:13:53	A couple-- man and a woman.
230	00:13:53	00:13:55	So Daycia brought her killer home.
231	00:13:55	00:13:58	00 a.m.
232	00:13:58	00:14:01	Daycia, as we know, is messed up on pills.
233	00:14:01	00:14:03	And then they ended up in the tub.
234	00:14:03	00:14:05	You know, maybe she...
235	00:14:05	00:14:09	maybe she refused his sexual advances, or... the sex got out of control?
236	00:14:09	00:14:10	Either way...
237	00:14:11	00:14:13	...he ends up drowning her.
238	00:14:15	00:14:17	Yeah, but look around.
239	00:14:17	00:14:20	The tub, the towels-- everything's clean and dry.
240	00:14:20	00:14:21	It's like nothing ever happened.
241	00:14:21	00:14:24	So, after Daycia was dead, he cleaned up.
242	00:14:26	00:14:30	Took her body out of the tub, and then erased any sign that they had ever been here at all.
243	00:14:30	00:14:37	If they came here in a cab, how did the killer get Daycia's body all the way to the pool, which is over a mile away?
244	00:14:37	00:14:38	That's a good question.
245	00:14:38	00:14:44	In the meantime, the cab company is trying to locate the driver, and we got to figure out where the evidence from this room ended up.
246	00:14:44	00:14:47	All right, I'm gonna go talk to the other people living here.
247	00:14:47	00:14:50	This is rehab-- nobody sleeps-- so I'm sure somebody saw something.
248	00:14:50	00:14:52	Let's hope.
249	00:14:52	00:15:03	I was up the whole night, crawling between hot showers to stop the chills and hugging the toilet and puking my guts out.
250	00:15:03	00:15:05	I didn't hear anything.
251	00:15:05	00:15:07	I wish I would have, you know, heard something.
252	00:15:07	00:15:11	Maybe I could have tried to help her.
253	00:15:11	00:15:14	I was watching a movie on my laptop, and I had my headphones in.
254	00:15:14	00:15:16	So many addicts.
255	00:15:16	00:15:21	They can be really nice people, but when they're using, they make some very poor choices.
256	00:15:21	00:15:25	Daycia was young and immature and...
257	00:15:25	00:15:27	let her addiction cloud her judgment.
258	00:15:27	00:15:32	Look, to me, Daycia was never gonna get clean, 'cause she didn't have to.
259	00:15:32	00:15:35	No matter what, she had a rich husband waiting for her at home.
260	00:15:35	00:15:39	You know, you... you're just never gonna hit rock bottom if you got a safety net like that.
261	00:15:39	00:15:42	This is really messing with my head.
262	00:15:43	00:15:46	I came here to get healthy.
263	00:15:46	00:15:47	This is not what I needed.
264	00:15:47	00:15:50	You know, last night wasn't the first night that she went out drinking and partying.
265	00:15:50	00:15:53	She pretty much went partying and shopping any time she felt like it.
266	00:15:54	00:15:58	I was against giving her so much latitude, but...
267	00:15:58	00:15:58	Adam's the boss.
268	00:15:59	00:16:01	I have to get sober this time.
269	00:16:01	00:16:02	I don't have a choice.
270	00:16:02	00:16:04	The stakes...
271	00:16:04	00:16:06	the stakes are just too high.
272	00:16:06	00:16:09	If I fail...
273	00:16:09	00:16:12	I lose my kids.
274	00:16:12	00:16:16	My biggest concern was Daycia's effect on the other patients.
275	00:16:16	00:16:18	She was toxic in that way.
276	00:16:18	00:16:19	This sucks.
277	00:16:19	00:16:22	I can't believe she did this.
278	00:16:22	00:16:25	Frankly, if it'd been up to me, she never would have been in here.
279	00:16:28	00:16:29	Hey.
280	00:16:29	00:16:33	So, this is the cab that brought our victim home this morning. Okay.
281	00:16:33	00:16:39	Now, if it was the killer that rode with her, then hopefully he left us some kind of trace.
282	00:16:39	00:16:41	Yeah, hopefully, 'cause I just got done talking with the driver.
283	00:16:41	00:16:43	Give you a description? No, not really.
284	00:16:43	00:16:46	The only thing he could remember is that the guy was a white male.
285	00:16:46	00:16:49	Probably couldn't take his eye off the pretty girl the whole time.
286	00:16:49	00:16:56	Yeah, probably. Did say she was in pretty rough shape, but he didn't think she was in any real danger.
287	00:16:56	00:16:58	I'm sure she didn't think so, either.
288	00:16:58	00:16:59	Till the last second.
289	00:16:59	00:17:01	Give me a call if you find something.
290	00:17:01	00:17:01	Okay.
291	00:17:13	00:17:17	I've seen, uh, plenty of people Dumpster-dive before, but they never made it look so good.
292	00:17:17	00:17:19	Why don't you let me get that for you?
293	00:17:19	00:17:20	It's Zach, right?
294	00:17:20	00:17:22	It'd be better if you didn't touch anything.
295	00:17:22	00:17:23	Ah, yes.
296	00:17:23	00:17:24	Evidence.
297	00:17:24	00:17:25	Uh, I just wanted to help.
298	00:17:25	00:17:27	You want to help?
299	00:17:27	00:17:29	You could tell me about Daycia.
300	00:17:29	00:17:31	We think she may have brought a guy home last night.
301	00:17:31	00:17:32	Sounds like she's quite the party girl.
302	00:17:32	00:17:33	May have not been the first time.
303	00:17:33	00:17:34	You ever see her with anybody?
304	00:17:34	00:17:37	Ah, here at the house, no.
305	00:17:37	00:17:40	But somewhere else, with someone?
306	00:17:40	00:17:44	Well, don't tell Twyla, but, uh...
307	00:17:44	00:17:46	I let Daycia talk me into going out one night.
308	00:17:46	00:17:52	See, one of the things you got to know about me is, pretty women, they're like my kryptonite, you know?
309	00:17:52	00:17:54	Maybe my deadliest of addictions.
310	00:17:54	00:17:58	So you went clubbing and you saw her hook up with somebody.
311	00:17:58	00:18:03	There was this guy at one of the clubs, this cowboy who was watching her.
312	00:18:03	00:18:04	Older guy.
313	00:18:04	00:18:08	I didn't think much of it, because with Daycia, all the guys watched her, you know?
314	00:18:08	00:18:16	Little while later, I went to the bar to get a drink, and when I came back, I saw Daycia heading out the door with this guy, the cowboy.
315	00:18:16	00:18:18	So she just picked up and left, just like that?
316	00:18:18	00:18:19	She was in group the next morning.
317	00:18:19	00:18:22	She didn't mention it. I didn't, either.
318	00:18:22	00:18:23	Never came up again.
319	00:18:23	00:18:24	Well...
320	00:18:24	00:18:26	I'm gonna get this run in.
321	00:18:26	00:18:27	Got to clear my head.
322	00:18:27	00:18:31	All this talk of bars and women-- start tugging me in the wrong direction, you know?
323	00:18:31	00:18:34	Well, I may need to talk to you again later.
324	00:18:34	00:18:36	Just, uh, take it easy on me.
325	00:18:36	00:18:38	Remember what I said about kryptonite.
326	00:18:38	00:18:40	How could I forget?
327	00:18:40	00:18:42	Wow.
328	00:19:04	00:19:06	Huh.
329	00:19:06	00:19:08	Bingo.
330	00:20:30	00:20:32	Hey.
331	00:20:32	00:20:34	I've got slightly better news than last time.
332	00:20:34	00:20:36	I was able to pull DNA from your bath towels.
333	00:20:36	00:20:37	Two contributors.
334	00:20:37	00:20:39	One the, uh, victim, I assume.
335	00:20:39	00:20:40	What about the other?
336	00:20:40	00:20:43	An unknown male, not in CODIS, but this is interesting.
337	00:20:43	00:20:49	The DNA from the towel has the same four core loci as the DNA under the victim's nails.
338	00:20:49	00:20:52	Same unknown male-- our killer.
339	00:20:53	00:20:56	Still no way to put an I.D. to him.
340	00:20:56	00:20:57	What are you working on here?
341	00:20:57	00:21:01	These pieces of wax were found in the bag with the rest of the evidence.
342	00:21:01	00:21:04	I think it came from this candle.
343	00:21:04	00:21:06	Spilled while the wax was still hot.
344	00:21:06	00:21:09	The bottom's smooth, like the rim of a bathtub.
345	00:21:09	00:21:13	I'm thinking the wax was knocked over during the murder.
346	00:21:13	00:21:19	After the wax hardened, the killer used this lovely nail file to chip it up and clean up the mess.
347	00:21:19	00:21:21	Looks like there's some kind of impression there.
348	00:21:21	00:21:25	Mm-hmm. I'm thinking it's the killer's hand or arm.
349	00:21:25	00:21:28	If I can get this whole thing put together, I might be able to... Hey, have you seen Nick?
350	00:21:28	00:21:30	No, not recently.
351	00:21:30	00:21:33	Well, I got AFIS results on the lifts from the cab. Yours, too.
352	00:21:33	00:21:36	They match a felony DUI arrest from 2007.
353	00:21:36	00:21:38	The guy's prints were everywhere.
354	00:21:38	00:21:40	Well, whose prints?
355	00:21:40	00:21:51	Adam and I were just talking about how we should proceed in light of Daycia's death. And we both agree that it would be detrimental to your treatment if we were to shut down, even for a little while.
356	00:21:51	00:21:53	It's not gonna be easy, but we need to...
357	00:21:53	00:21:55	reestablish a sense of normalcy...
358	00:21:55	00:21:57	Hey, everybody.
359	00:21:58	00:21:59	Knock, knock.
360	00:21:59	00:22:03	And before you start spouting off again, the answer's yes, we have a warrant.
361	00:22:03	00:22:05	Only this time it's an arrest warrant.
362	00:22:05	00:22:07	Oh, my God, I don't believe this.
363	00:22:07	00:22:08	What are you talking about? Arrest?
364	00:22:08	00:22:13	Hook him up, Akers. Adam King, you're under arrest for the murder of Daycia Fox. Put your hands behind your back.
365	00:22:13	00:22:15	Adam, what-what is this? What's happening?
366	00:22:15	00:22:17	I don't know. It's a mistake.
367	00:22:17	00:22:18	Hey, I didn't kill Daycia.
368	00:22:18	00:22:20	You know that.
369	00:22:20	00:22:22	Let's go. You guys know that.
370	00:22:25	00:22:27	This is ridiculous. I didn't kill her.
371	00:22:27	00:22:29	She was my patient. I was helping her.
372	00:22:29	00:22:35	Hey, do you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I hear you. And you'll have plenty of time to plead your case in court. But right now... Mr. Fox?
373	00:22:37	00:22:39	Down on your knees!
374	00:22:39	00:22:41	Get down on the ground!
375	00:22:43	00:22:45	(groaning) Adam?
376	00:22:45	00:22:46	Adam.
377	00:22:46	00:22:48	Call the paramedics, Akers. Call them.
378	00:22:48	00:22:50	This is Officer Akers. Roll paramedics to my location.
379	00:22:57	00:23:03	Mr. Fox, I had you pegged as someone with just a little more sense.
380	00:23:03	00:23:05	Did you put any thought into how this was gonna turn out?
381	00:23:05	00:23:08	I trusted him.
382	00:23:10	00:23:16	I took the thing most precious in my life, and I put it in Adam King's hands.
383	00:23:16	00:23:18	He betrayed that trust. So you...
384	00:23:18	00:23:20	you just go and you shoot him?
385	00:23:20	00:23:22	You know, you're lucky you weren't shot yourself.
386	00:23:22	00:23:24	And you're damn lucky you didn't hit one of my officers.
387	00:23:28	00:23:38	You didn't know Daycia, Mr. Russell. I know you know about her, okay, her-her drinking and partying and her-her struggles.
388	00:23:38	00:23:41	You didn't know the...
389	00:23:41	00:23:46	the person that she was before this...
390	00:23:46	00:23:49	this-this sickness took hold of her.
391	00:23:51	00:23:53	Destroyed her.
392	00:23:54	00:23:56	Destroyed everything.
393	00:23:59	00:24:02	God's honest truth, I don't much care what happens now.
394	00:24:08	00:24:10	Uh, he shouldn't have those.
395	00:24:10	00:24:12	He's a former drug addict.
396	00:24:12	00:24:14	Painkillers probably aren't a good idea, right, Adam?
397	00:24:14	00:24:17	Guess you're just gonna have to tough it out.
398	00:24:17	00:24:19	Thank you.
399	00:24:23	00:24:29	I know you think that I'm some sort of monster, that I killed Daycia, but you're wrong.
400	00:24:29	00:24:35	This was taken from a traffic cam about five blocks away from the house where Daycia's body was found.
401	00:24:35	00:24:38	This is you, about to dump Daycia's body.
402	00:24:38	00:24:41	You want to tell me again how you didn't kill her?
403	00:24:41	00:24:44	I didn't.
404	00:24:44	00:24:48	I only moved the body.
405	00:24:48	00:24:50	From rehab to the swimming pool. But she was dead already.
406	00:24:50	00:24:53	I swear. That is not even a good attempt at a lie.
407	00:24:53	00:24:57	We found your fingerprints all over the taxicab.
408	00:24:57	00:24:59	And, uh, you did clean up the crime scene in the bathroom.
409	00:24:59	00:25:01	Yeah, I know all that.
410	00:25:01	00:25:05	Damn it, when Daycia didn't come home that night, I went out looking for her, all right?
411	00:25:05	00:25:07	Not the first time I had to hunt her down.
412	00:25:07	00:25:11	After searching a couple of clubs, I found her.
413	00:25:11	00:25:14	And I brought her home in the cab.
414	00:25:14	00:25:15	I put her to bed.
415	00:25:15	00:25:17	That still does not get us to here, Adam.
416	00:25:17	00:25:21	After a couple hours, I went in to go check on her, to see if she was okay.
417	00:25:21	00:25:23	She wasn't in her bed.
418	00:25:23	00:25:25	I found her in the tub.
419	00:25:25	00:25:27	Daycia. Daycia.
420	00:25:27	00:25:29	No. No. No, no, no.
421	00:25:32	00:25:33	She was dead.
422	00:25:33	00:25:38	Look, I figured she had just passed out, slipped under the water, you know?
423	00:25:38	00:25:41	That it was an accident. You still should've called 911. I should've.
424	00:25:41	00:25:43	But I panicked.
425	00:25:46	00:25:48	Daycia's wasn't the first death at Desert Peace.
426	00:25:48	00:25:52	We had an overdose eight months ago.
427	00:25:52	00:25:54	The backlash on the clinic was a nightmare.
428	00:25:54	00:25:58	Oh, so that's why you moved her body because you were afraid of the backlash?
429	00:25:58	00:26:06	Look, I had three other patients that I had to think about, who are fighting for their lives, who count on me. So...
430	00:26:06	00:26:09	I cleaned everything up and moved the body.
431	00:26:09	00:26:12	Made it look like she was never home.
432	00:26:12	00:26:17	He was telling the truth about one thing. Eight months ago, Desert Peace did have a fatality.
433	00:26:17	00:26:32	A female patient OD'd on sleeping pills. So Adam, covering up Daycia's death, was trying to avoid bad PR and maybe a hike in his insurance premiums, right? The question is, do we believe him when he says he did not kill her?
434	00:26:32	00:26:34	Well, personally, I would not trust a word.
435	00:26:34	00:26:41	But I did swab him, and his DNA did not match what we have on the bath towel or underneath the fingernails of the victim.
436	00:26:41	00:26:43	Which suggests he's not our guy. So...
437	00:26:43	00:26:45	what are we looking at?
438	00:26:45	00:26:52	At some point between the cab ride home and when Adam went to check on her, someone else went into Daycia's bathroom and killed her.
439	00:27:17	00:27:19	Hey, Nick, it's a ring.
440	00:27:19	00:27:23	The impression in the wax, it's two fingers and a ring.
441	00:27:23	00:27:26	Daycia was wearing a diamond ring when we found her. No, no.
442	00:27:26	00:27:29	It's not Daycia's ring. It's something different.
443	00:27:29	00:27:31	I think it's the killer's.
444	00:27:31	00:27:32	You're right.
445	00:27:32	00:27:34	That is a man's ring.
446	00:27:34	00:27:36	Yeah, and it's got an inscription on it, or at least a tiny part of one.
447	00:27:36	00:27:38	21, 12.
448	00:27:38	00:27:39	Like a class ring.
449	00:27:39	00:27:40	Or at least that's what I was thinking.
450	00:27:40	00:27:44	But then that's, like, a hundred years in the future, so there's no way it could be a class ring.
451	00:27:44	00:27:45	Well, what if it's not the year?
452	00:27:45	00:27:47	What if it's a... score?
453	00:27:47	00:27:48	You know? From a game.
454	00:27:48	00:27:49	21-12.
455	00:27:49	00:27:51	Why would someone put a score on a ring?
456	00:27:51	00:27:54	If it's a championship ring, a lot of times they'll put the score on there.
457	00:27:54	00:27:56	Zach.
458	00:27:56	00:27:59	Hmm? Zach Alton, he's one of the patients at the rehab center.
459	00:27:59	00:28:01	He-he used to be a jock at WLVU.
460	00:28:01	00:28:03	Football, I think.
461	00:28:03	00:28:03	Let's see.
462	00:28:05	00:28:06	Right here.
463	00:28:06	00:28:09	2007. WLVU Mustangs won their conference championship.
464	00:28:09	00:28:11	21-12?
465	00:28:11	00:28:12	21-12.
466	00:28:36	00:28:38	I, uh... (clears throat)
467	00:28:38	00:28:41	I'm afraid I don't have any good news for you.
468	00:28:41	00:28:46	Your DNA was a match to the DNA we found on the towels in Daycia's bathroom.
469	00:28:46	00:28:52	It was also a match to the DNA we found under her fingernails, which is no surprise, considering the scratches on your chest.
470	00:28:52	00:29:04	As far as your blood goes, we found traces of diazepam and oxycodone, the same drugs that were in Daycia's system and the same drugs that we found in her bathroom.
471	00:29:04	00:29:08	So, as you can see, the evidence pretty much tells the story here.
472	00:29:08	00:29:12	Unless there's something you'd like to add.
473	00:29:12	00:29:14	I mean...
474	00:29:14	00:29:16	wh-why would I kill her?
475	00:29:16	00:29:18	Why would I do anything?
476	00:29:18	00:29:20	It doesn't even make sense.
477	00:29:20	00:29:22	Are you trying to tell me you can't remember anything?
478	00:29:23	00:29:25	I only remember parts.
479	00:29:25	00:29:28	I remember I was in bed, asleep.
480	00:29:28	00:29:30	I don't know what time it was.
481	00:29:30	00:29:32	And, uh...
482	00:29:32	00:29:35	Daycia comes in the room wearing next to nothing.
483	00:29:35	00:29:37	Zach.
484	00:29:38	00:29:40	I'm gonna take a bath.
485	00:29:40	00:29:44	And it is an awfully big tub.
486	00:29:44	00:29:46	You want to join?
487	00:29:46	00:29:48	You know this is a bad idea.
488	00:29:48	00:29:52	Ooh. Then I guess this is a bad idea, too, huh?
489	00:29:54	00:29:55	Pretty women.
490	00:29:55	00:29:56	They're my...
491	00:29:56	00:29:59	Kryptonite. Yeah, I heard. We get it.
492	00:30:00	00:30:02	So you ended up in the tub...
493	00:30:10	00:30:15	One drink leads to another, she brings out the pills and...
494	00:30:15	00:30:18	I don't know, I guess at that point I figured, might as well go all in.
495	00:30:22	00:30:26	But the rest...
496	00:30:26	00:30:30	I cannot for the life of me remember.
497	00:30:30	00:30:32	It's... a blackout.
498	00:30:32	00:30:39	I woke up the next morning by myself in my bed, and Daycia was nowhere around, so...
499	00:30:39	00:30:42	So you just went about your day?
500	00:30:42	00:30:45	I had no idea I killed her.
501	00:30:45	00:30:49	Unfortunately, that doesn't make it any less of a crime.
502	00:30:55	00:30:57	Got your text, Doc. Why the 911?
503	00:30:57	00:31:01	Just examining a tissue section from your drowning victim's organs.
504	00:31:01	00:31:02	Have a gander.
505	00:31:05	00:31:09	What am I looking at? Lung tissue, specifically alveoli.
506	00:31:09	00:31:12	They're the little sacs where oxygen and CO2 are exchanged.
507	00:31:12	00:31:15	They're blown, all popped like tiny balloons. Well, why?
508	00:31:15	00:31:20	What would cause that? Well, normally I would say barotrauma. You know, the bends.
509	00:31:20	00:31:25	A diver ascends too fast, causing excess air pressure in the lungs.
510	00:31:25	00:31:28	Only the damage here was caused by excess water pressure.
511	00:31:28	00:31:31	From the drowning, right? No, that's the problem.
512	00:31:31	00:31:33	With drowning, you don't generate pressure.
513	00:31:33	00:31:36	Certainly not enough pressure to pop the alveoli.
514	00:31:36	00:31:44	This young girl's lungs filled with a rush of water with enough force to cause the alveoli to expand beyond their capacity.
515	00:31:44	00:31:46	So what are you saying happened?
516	00:31:46	00:31:53	The only scenario I can think of is that someone pumped water into her lungs forcibly, intentionally.
517	00:31:53	00:31:55	Like someone put a tube down her throat.
518	00:31:55	00:31:59	And then pumped water into her, I'd have to say, after she was already dead.
519	00:31:59	00:32:00	So, she didn't drown.
520	00:32:00	00:32:03	The killer only wanted to make it look like she drowned.
521	00:32:03	00:32:10	The more likely cause of death was suffocation, which ultimately yields the same results as drowning-- asphyxiation of the brain.
522	00:32:10	00:32:17	There was foreign matter in the lungs-- organic flecks, I couldn't identify-- and I sent those to Hodges for analysis.
523	00:32:17	00:32:21	But the bottom line is, we've been working with the wrong cause of death.
524	00:32:21	00:32:25	And with the wrong cause of death, you most likely have the wrong killer.
525	00:32:29	00:32:38	At the time of Daycia's death, the football star, Zach, had been drinking, and he had two different prescription meds in him, so, he was pretty seriously impaired.
526	00:32:38	00:32:41	He's not denying he killed Daycia.
527	00:32:41	00:32:43	He pretty much confessed.
528	00:32:43	00:32:44	He says he blacked out.
529	00:32:44	00:32:47	So, you're thinking that Zach's not responsible for the murder?
530	00:32:47	00:32:50	According to the doc, the drowning was staged by pumping her body full of water.
531	00:32:50	00:32:56	Now, if that's the case, that means the killer had to feed a tube down her trachea, into her lungs. That's not an easy thing to do.
532	00:32:56	00:32:57	Basically had to intubate her.
533	00:32:57	00:33:00	I've seen ER docs struggle to do this.
534	00:33:00	00:33:03	It takes dexterity, at the very least.
535	00:33:03	00:33:06	Zach was drunk and full of meds, so, no way he could have pulled that off.
536	00:33:06	00:33:09	If Zach is not the killer, where are we?
537	00:33:09	00:33:14	We know that Adam brought Daycia home in the cab 00 a.m., and says that he put her to bed.
538	00:33:14	00:33:17	Come on, Adam! I'm not tired!
539	00:33:17	00:33:18	Everybody's trying to sleep, okay?
540	00:33:18	00:33:21	Yeah, well, I'm not gonna be able to go to sleep.
541	00:33:21	00:33:23	Okay, well, let's just try to get you in bed.
542	00:33:23	00:33:30	And we know that Daycia wasn't ready to call it a night, so she goes and convinces Zach that it's a good time to take a bath.
543	00:33:30	00:33:33	You don't see anything that you want?
544	00:33:33	00:33:35	Come on, Zach.
545	00:33:35	00:33:44	In they go into the tub, they have sex, leaving the marks on Daycia's neck, and the scratches on Zach, but, also, leaving Daycia alive and well.
546	00:33:44	00:33:48	Tub takes 45 minutes, at the most, an hour.
547	00:33:48	00:33:51	That gives the killer plenty of time to take care of business.
548	00:33:51	00:34:00	So, not counting Zach and Adam, there were three other people in the house that we know of. There were two patients-- Karen and Len-- and a staffer named Twyla.
549	00:34:00	00:34:04	At this point, any one of the three is a candidate.
550	00:34:11	00:34:13	Morgan? Hey.
551	00:34:13	00:34:14	Hodges, what's going on?
552	00:34:14	00:34:17	I could use a little help as to context.
553	00:34:17	00:34:21	Doc Robbins found a foreign substance in your victim's lungs, sent me a sample for analysis.
554	00:34:21	00:34:23	Okay, what did he find?
555	00:34:23	00:34:24	It's all organic.
556	00:34:24	00:34:28	Primarily a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and carbon.
557	00:34:28	00:34:31	Some of the nitrogen had converted into ammonia.
558	00:34:31	00:34:33	How can I help?
559	00:34:33	00:34:39	Well, it's just that what's suggested by the chemicals and their particular proportions is waste.
560	00:34:39	00:34:41	Specifically, fish or bird waste.
561	00:34:41	00:34:43	Now, I don't know how that could have gotten into your victim's lungs.
562	00:34:43	00:34:45	Fish waste.
563	00:34:45	00:34:46	But that doesn't make any sense.
564	00:34:46	00:34:49	Actually, Hodges, it makes perfect sense.
565	00:34:59	00:35:01	Ah. Look at this.
566	00:35:04	00:35:04	Tubing.
567	00:35:04	00:35:08	Looks like it would be the right size to put down someone's throat.
568	00:35:08	00:35:10	Yeah. Now, all you would need is a...
569	00:35:10	00:35:12	pump... (pump whistles)
570	00:35:12	00:35:14	to pump with.
571	00:35:20	00:35:22	The same set of prints shows up on everything.
572	00:35:22	00:35:26	They come back to the house therapist, Twyla Owens.
573	00:35:27	00:35:31	Oh, you said that she took care of the fish tank, so it makes sense that her prints would be everywhere.
574	00:35:31	00:35:34	Well, everywhere except for the plastic tubing.
575	00:35:34	00:35:36	There were no prints there. It's been wiped clean. And what about the pump?
576	00:35:36	00:35:40	Has tons of her prints on it, and nobody else's.
577	00:35:40	00:35:42	Why would the killer clean one and not the other?
578	00:35:42	00:35:44	Oh.
579	00:35:48	00:35:50	Because the killer didn't use the pump.
580	00:35:50	00:35:52	There's a crack in the housing.
581	00:35:54	00:35:57	Yeah, and it's bone dry.
582	00:35:57	00:35:59	There's no way this was part of the murder weapon.
583	00:35:59	00:36:02	Yeah, but the killer had to use something to force the water into Daycia's lungs.
584	00:36:02	00:36:06	I mean, Doc said her alveoli were popped like balloons.
585	00:36:08	00:36:14	Well, then, maybe the killer pumped the water the same way that you'd blow up a balloon.
586	00:36:15	00:36:17	Maybe he used his mouth.
587	00:36:21	00:36:26	If that's the case, maybe our killer left us just what we need.
588	00:36:30	00:36:32	Come on, this is insane.
589	00:36:32	00:36:34	This is absolutely insane.
590	00:36:34	00:36:36	I'm two days away from completing the program.
591	00:36:36	00:36:38	Two days away from...
592	00:36:38	00:36:40	holding my kids in my arms again.
593	00:36:40	00:36:43	Is this some kind of sick joke?
594	00:36:43	00:36:47	Look, Daycia's death had absolutely nothing to do with me.
595	00:36:47	00:36:50	Says here that you worked as an EMT in college.
596	00:36:50	00:36:51	Is that right? Yeah.
597	00:36:51	00:36:54	Taught you how to intubate a patient, didn't they?
598	00:36:55	00:37:04	Yeah. Yeah. So what? Too bad they didn't teach you about DNA, because you left yours all over the tube there when you blew in it.
599	00:37:04	00:37:09	We also found the pillow that you used to suffocate Daycia.
600	00:37:10	00:37:13	Look, we have everything we need.
601	00:37:13	00:37:15	We know you did it.
602	00:37:17	00:37:21	Of all the people in that house, you were the one with the most to lose.
603	00:37:21	00:37:22	Why would you do something...?
604	00:37:22	00:37:26	Because I had the most to lose, because...
605	00:37:26	00:37:28	because of my children.
606	00:37:30	00:37:32	You know what Daycia was?
607	00:37:33	00:37:36	Day-Daycia was that, um...
608	00:37:36	00:37:39	She was that little devil.
609	00:37:39	00:37:43	And the little devil sits on your shoulder, tempts you to do bad things.
610	00:37:43	00:37:45	So, wait. What are you... what are you saying?
611	00:37:45	00:37:48	Wh... Daycia tempted you in some way? What?
612	00:37:48	00:37:49	With alcohol?
613	00:37:49	00:37:53	I woke up... to go the bathroom in the middle of the night.
614	00:37:53	00:37:56	00.
615	00:37:56	00:37:59	I got back to my room.
616	00:37:59	00:38:02	There was a bottle sitting on my nightstand.
617	00:38:02	00:38:08	A bottle of bourbon, my brand, with a damn ribbon on it.
618	00:38:08	00:38:11	And-and you think that Daycia put it there. I know Daycia put it there.
619	00:38:11	00:38:14	Like I just told you, she was that little devil.
620	00:38:14	00:38:17	So, I got up, and I went, and I confronted her.
621	00:38:17	00:38:19	What the hell is this, Daycia?
622	00:38:19	00:38:20	Why did you put this in my room?
623	00:38:20	00:38:23	Geez, Len, lighten up. It's a gift.
624	00:38:23	00:38:27	You know how important the program is to me, that I stay clean so I don't lose my kids.
625	00:38:27	00:38:29	You know you want some. Stop it.
626	00:38:29	00:38:31	Don't make me drink all by myself.
627	00:38:31	00:38:32	Mmm.
628	00:38:32	00:38:35	She wouldn't stop.
629	00:38:35	00:38:37	She wouldn't back off.
630	00:38:37	00:38:38	She just kept at it.
631	00:38:38	00:38:41	She kept trying to get me to drink.
632	00:38:41	00:38:45	Look, all I wanted to do was shut her up.
633	00:38:45	00:38:47	with the pillow, I mean.
634	00:38:47	00:38:50	I mean, come on, it was a pillow.
635	00:38:50	00:38:55	I put it over her face just to get her to stop talking.
636	00:38:55	00:38:57	Stop it! Stop it! No, stop! (muffled scream)
637	00:38:57	00:39:00	I've worked too hard. I'm not gonna throw my life away.
638	00:39:10	00:39:13	I'm... sorry.
639	00:39:16	00:39:21	The bathtub in Daycia's room was already full, so I thought, why not...
640	00:39:21	00:39:23	why not just make it look like an accident?
641	00:39:23	00:39:27	Make it look like she just... slipped away.
642	00:39:27	00:39:30	I put her in the water.
643	00:39:30	00:39:36	I got the piece of tubing from the fish tank, and I made it look like she drowned.
644	00:39:38	00:39:43	Insane part of this whole thing is, I made it, you know that?
645	00:39:45	00:39:48	I didn't drink.
646	00:39:48	00:39:49	Even after she was dead...
647	00:39:51	00:39:54	...and it was quiet in that room.
648	00:39:54	00:39:57	I took that bottle, and I poured it in the toil... toilet.
649	00:40:02	00:40:04	I didn't touch it.
650	00:40:06	00:40:08	I didn't take a sip.
651	00:40:08	00:40:10	I needed to do that.
652	00:40:20	00:40:23	For them.
653	00:40:29	00:40:32	So, we are just about cleared out, and I'm officially releasing the rooms.
654	00:40:32	00:40:33	Good.
655	00:40:33	00:40:35	We got two new patients coming in.
656	00:40:35	00:40:38	Wow. You don't waste any time, do you? We can't afford to.
657	00:40:38	00:40:39	A lot of people need help.
658	00:40:43	00:40:48	You know, I-I was really harsh the other day when I talked to you about Daycia, and I shouldn't have been.
659	00:40:48	00:40:50	She didn't understand her addiction.
660	00:40:50	00:40:52	Didn't realize that she was battling a disease.
661	00:40:52	00:40:54	Most people don't.
662	00:40:54	00:40:57	Patients come in here thinking all they have to do is put in the time.
663	00:40:57	00:41:00	Beating addiction is work.
664	00:41:00	00:41:02	Really hard work.
665	00:41:02	00:41:05	And sadly, not everyone's up for the challenge.
666	00:41:05	00:41:07	Well, I don't know how you do what you do.
667	00:41:07	00:41:09	I was gonna say the same thing to you.
668	00:41:09	00:41:12	Guess we just keep doing it, though.
669	00:41:12	00:41:17	If we don't, who will? Hmm. Good luck.
