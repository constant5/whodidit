0	00:00:16	00:00:20	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
1	00:01:12	00:01:15	This came for you, Mr. Grissom.
2	00:01:17	00:01:19	What's this?
3	00:01:19	00:01:21	An anonymous package from county lockup?
4	00:01:21	00:01:23	Yeah, well, hey, just a second.
5	00:01:23	00:01:26	Wait a minute. Give an innocent bystander a chance to clear out.
6	00:01:26	00:01:28	What are you worried about?
7	00:01:28	00:01:29	One minute I'm eating tomato salad.
8	00:01:29	00:01:32	The next-- I'm gazpacho.
9	00:01:37	00:01:40	With any luck it'll be the next episode of G-String Divas.
10	00:01:49	00:01:52	My name is Frank Damon...
11	00:01:52	00:01:56	and I'm awaiting trial for the murder of...
12	00:01:56	00:01:58	my wife and son.
13	00:01:58	00:02:00	That's an arson case a few months ago.
14	00:02:00	00:02:02	The D.A. is asking for the death penalty.
15	00:02:04	00:02:08	I didn't kill my family...
16	00:02:08	00:02:11	but my lawyer says the evidence is against me.
17	00:02:11	00:02:14	I was a good father.
18	00:02:14	00:02:16	I loved him.
19	00:02:16	00:02:20	I would have given my life for Toby and Jeannie.
20	00:02:20	00:02:21	They were my world.
21	00:02:21	00:02:25	Mr. Grissom, you are my last hope.
22	00:02:25	00:02:27	Please...
23	00:02:29	00:02:30	help me.
24	00:02:30	00:02:33	An innocent man.
25	00:02:34	00:02:35	Jail's full of them.
26	00:02:35	00:02:39	It only takes one.
27	00:03:22	00:03:23	Am I disturbing you?
28	00:03:23	00:03:24	Yeah.
29	00:03:24	00:03:26	Good.
30	00:03:26	00:03:29	Oh. Great. Sorry.
31	00:03:29	00:03:33	Uh, I was supposed to pass out some supervisor evaluation forms.
32	00:03:33	00:03:34	Where are they?
33	00:03:34	00:03:36	Here they are.
34	00:03:36	00:03:38	Mm. Get to rate the boss. I dig this.
35	00:03:38	00:03:40	Give him a perfect ten or your ass is out of here.
36	00:03:40	00:03:42	No, it's not.
37	00:03:43	00:03:45	parking lot of the sportsbook at The Monaco.
38	00:03:45	00:03:48	Caucasian male found dead in the front seat of his car.
39	00:03:48	00:03:49	Two days before the Super Bowl.
40	00:03:49	00:03:51	I'll take a piece of that.
41	00:03:51	00:03:53	No. Uh, Nick and Catherine.
42	00:03:53	00:03:56	You and Warrick are working with me.
43	00:03:56	00:03:57	Prisoner plea.
44	00:03:57	00:03:58	Brass told me about the video.
45	00:03:58	00:04:00	If we take the case, we have very little time.
46	00:04:00	00:04:01	The trial starts in three days.
47	00:04:02	00:04:03	How did he find you?
48	00:04:03	00:04:04	1-800-GRISSOM...?
49	00:04:04	00:04:05	Wait a minute.
50	00:04:05	00:04:09	Ecklie was the CSI on that arson.
51	00:04:09	00:04:12	I see a bad moon rising.
52	00:04:12	00:04:14	Can a CSI take over another CSI's case?
53	00:04:14	00:04:16	Only if they're of equal rank and looking for trouble.
54	00:04:16	00:04:18	No trouble.
55	00:04:18	00:04:20	We're both colleagues searching for the truth.
56	00:04:20	00:04:21	Okay, that's it. Look onward.
57	00:04:22	00:04:24	You have to start by looking at this.
58	00:04:24	00:04:26	Hey, what happened to that, uh, meeting the other day?
59	00:04:26	00:04:28	Meeting?
60	00:04:28	00:04:31	Yeah, the department heads were voting on an extra vacation day or something?
61	00:04:31	00:04:32	Yeah.
62	00:04:36	00:04:40	Hmm. Organization... minus one.
63	00:04:44	00:04:46	Yo, cousin.
64	00:04:47	00:04:48	I'm going to save you some gas here.
65	00:04:48	00:04:50	I did some checking on your pal, Damon.
66	00:04:50	00:04:52	I don't remember asking you to.
67	00:04:52	00:04:54	Eyewitness saw him running from his burning house.
68	00:04:54	00:04:55	Inside was his wife and kid.
69	00:04:55	00:04:56	Now, wife's a big spender.
70	00:04:57	00:04:58	Maxed out on the credit cards.
71	00:04:58	00:05:01	They just bought the place and already he's late on the payments.
72	00:05:01	00:05:03	Couple's always arguing about money. No surprise.
73	00:05:04	00:05:07	Well, how does killing his family solve his money problems?
74	00:05:07	00:05:08	Maybe he didn't mean to.
75	00:05:08	00:05:11	Maybe he needed the insurance dough and things got out of hand.
76	00:05:11	00:05:13	Too many maybes.
77	00:05:13	00:05:15	I think we should go with the evidence.
78	00:05:15	00:05:17	Well, I got something for you on that, too.
79	00:05:17	00:05:19	Gasoline found in the master bedroom closet.
80	00:05:19	00:05:21	Yeah. Hydrocarbon. I read Ecklie's brief.
81	00:05:21	00:05:24	Did you skip the page that had Damon's credit card receipts?
82	00:05:25	00:05:28	'Cause he bought a gallon of gas a week before the fire.
83	00:05:28	00:05:32	Do I seem like the kind of guy who skips stuff?
84	00:05:32	00:05:33	Read my lips.
85	00:05:33	00:05:37	There is no compelling evidence to suggest Damon was wrongfully charged.
86	00:05:37	00:05:40	Well, then, it'll be a short interview, won't it?
87	00:05:48	00:05:53	Whew! Two days before the Super Bowl and they're already killing each other.
88	00:05:54	00:05:56	Hey, O'Riley, anyone put their meat hooks on this vehicle?
89	00:05:57	00:05:58	How long have we worked together?
90	00:05:58	00:06:00	Still got to ask.
91	00:06:00	00:06:01	Sergeant.
92	00:06:01	00:06:02	What's up?
93	00:06:03	00:06:04	Oh...
94	00:06:04	00:06:07	Gunshot wound to the head, point-blank range.
95	00:06:07	00:06:11	Just a baby.
96	00:06:25	00:06:27	Tap city.
97	00:06:27	00:06:29	Empty.
98	00:06:29	00:06:33	Killer was probably in the back seat waiting for him.
99	00:06:35	00:06:38	Kid never stood a chance.
100	00:06:42	00:06:44	Check this out.
101	00:06:44	00:06:45	Hearing aid?
102	00:06:45	00:06:47	Maybe he was deaf.
103	00:06:47	00:06:49	Possibly.
104	00:06:57	00:07:01	Got some condensation on the window.
105	00:07:01	00:07:03	You should get a shot of this.
106	00:07:07	00:07:10	You hungry, Nick?
107	00:07:10	00:07:11	Got a burger.
108	00:07:11	00:07:14	Extra lettuce.
109	00:07:14	00:07:17	$2,500 an inch.
110	00:07:18	00:07:20	There's got to be...
111	00:07:20	00:07:21	$15,000 there?
112	00:07:21	00:07:25	Rams negative nine.
113	00:07:30	00:07:32	Oh, Rams minus nine.
114	00:07:32	00:07:34	It's a Super Bowl ticket.
115	00:07:34	00:07:36	Straight bet-- $30,000.
116	00:07:36	00:07:40	What does a kid doing walking around with a wad like that betting 30 grand on a football game?
117	00:07:40	00:07:43	Who wrote the ticket?
118	00:07:43	00:07:45	Teller 12.
119	00:07:45	00:07:47	Yeah, I wrote the ticket. So what?
120	00:07:47	00:07:50	So, it was found with the kid killed in your parking lot.
121	00:07:50	00:07:52	Yeah. 30 dimes. It was 517's.
122	00:07:52	00:07:53	517?
123	00:07:53	00:07:55	What's that? That's his number.
124	00:07:55	00:07:55	He was a runner.
125	00:07:55	00:07:57	A runner?
126	00:07:57	00:08:00	Yeah, a go-fer-- runs from book to book places bets with other people's money.
127	00:08:00	00:08:02	Kid wasn't a day over 16. Isn't that illegal?
128	00:08:02	00:08:04	Lady, he's not buying a pack of cigarettes.
129	00:08:04	00:08:05	He's betting $30,000.
130	00:08:05	00:08:06	Vig for the house is three grand.
131	00:08:07	00:08:07	We look the other way.
132	00:08:08	00:08:11	Well, I'd be willing to bet there's a mother out there that wishes you hadn't.
133	00:08:11	00:08:12	Hey, what do I care?
134	00:08:12	00:08:14	I'm out of this job by the end of the week.
135	00:08:14	00:08:16	Tired of looking at scumbags.
136	00:08:16	00:08:17	Well, does 517 have a name?
137	00:08:17	00:08:19	I only know them by their numbers.
138	00:08:19	00:08:21	Well, you've been very helpful.
139	00:08:21	00:08:22	Thank you.
140	00:08:30	00:08:31	Thanks.
141	00:08:31	00:08:33	Yo, Grissom!
142	00:08:34	00:08:37	Yo, man, this guy's the reason I'm in here.
143	00:08:37	00:08:38	Shoe print.
144	00:08:38	00:08:40	Yo, man, next time I'll go barefoot!
145	00:08:40	00:08:42	Even better.
146	00:08:42	00:08:44	Footprints.
147	00:09:02	00:09:05	So, you're the Grissom they wrote about in the newspaper?
148	00:09:05	00:09:09	I thought you'd be older.
149	00:09:09	00:09:11	Why did you contact me, Mr. Damon?
150	00:09:11	00:09:14	Arson specialist gave me your name.
151	00:09:14	00:09:17	Well, six of them, actually.
152	00:09:17	00:09:20	They all turned my case down.
153	00:09:20	00:09:23	Will you help me?
154	00:09:23	00:09:26	Fires are very complicated.
155	00:09:26	00:09:29	It wasn't too complicated for the guy who put me in here.
156	00:09:34	00:09:40	You think if you stare at me long enough, you can tell if I'm innocent?
157	00:09:40	00:09:42	I don't mean to stare...
158	00:09:42	00:09:45	but yes, I can learn some things.
159	00:09:45	00:09:48	For instance the back of your hands are smooth.
160	00:09:48	00:09:49	You read a lot.
161	00:09:50	00:09:54	You have indentation marks on your nose from reading glasses.
162	00:09:54	00:09:58	Your speech tells me that you're well-educated.
163	00:09:58	00:10:05	Your occupation's not listed in the file but I think that you had a white-collar job.
164	00:10:05	00:10:08	Paper-pusher for the phone company.
165	00:10:08	00:10:14	I don't know yet whether you're left- or right-handed, though.
166	00:10:16	00:10:20	Now, you want to tell me what happened?
167	00:10:22	00:10:24	It was about midnight.
168	00:10:24	00:10:25	Okay, baby.
169	00:10:25	00:10:28	My wife, Jeannie-- she was hungry.
170	00:10:28	00:10:30	She had a food craving.
171	00:10:30	00:10:33	She sent me out to the store to get her some ice cream.
172	00:10:33	00:10:36	My son, Toby, he was in the bed with us.
173	00:10:36	00:10:37	He couldn't sleep.
174	00:10:37	00:10:40	I was going to take him camping the next day.
175	00:10:43	00:10:46	Toby was eight.
176	00:10:46	00:10:50	Why don't you tell me about the fire.
177	00:10:53	00:10:57	I got back from the store in under 20 minutes.
178	00:10:57	00:11:01	I saw smoke coming out the back of the house.
179	00:11:01	00:11:02	I could hear the alarm.
180	00:11:02	00:11:03	Jeannie!
181	00:11:03	00:11:05	The house was filled with smoke.
182	00:11:06	00:11:07	Jeannie!
183	00:11:07	00:11:08	I checked the door for heat.
184	00:11:08	00:11:10	I knew not to open it.
185	00:11:11	00:11:12	Why? Flashover.
186	00:11:12	00:11:15	Flashover?
187	00:11:15	00:11:16	That's right.
188	00:11:16	00:11:23	When the fire reaches about 932 degrees Fahrenheit you add oxygen and the smoke will burst into flame.
189	00:11:23	00:11:30	I know how fire behaves, Mr. Grissom because I'm a volunteer fireman.
190	00:11:30	00:11:34	I was hoping to make the department this spring.
191	00:11:34	00:11:36	So I couldn't open the door.
192	00:11:36	00:11:39	I ran outside to my car to call a rig.
193	00:11:39	00:11:46	Well, if you're a volunteer fireman then you must be familiar with the use of accelerants.
194	00:11:46	00:11:47	Yes.
195	00:11:47	00:11:53	According to the report there were traces of gasoline found on the floor of your bedroom closet.
196	00:11:53	00:11:59	That's right, and I don't know how it got there.
197	00:11:59	00:12:01	I didn't keep anything like that in the house.
198	00:12:01	00:12:09	Our homicide department has a credit card receipt for gasoline-- your receipt and there's no other suspects.
199	00:12:09	00:12:15	I didn't burn down my house, Mr. Grissom.
200	00:12:15	00:12:23	I bought the gasoline for the lawnmower and kept it in the garage.
201	00:12:23	00:12:29	Now, if there was gasoline in our closet someone else put it there.
202	00:12:29	00:12:30	Find them.
203	00:12:31	00:12:32	I don't chase criminals, Mr. Damon.
204	00:12:33	00:12:34	I just evaluate evidence.
205	00:12:34	00:12:41	I need someone to believe me-- to figure this out.
206	00:12:42	00:12:45	How'd you burn your hand, Mr. Damon?
207	00:12:48	00:12:50	I don't remember.
208	00:12:50	00:12:56	People with third-degree burns don't forget how they got them.
209	00:13:00	00:13:03	You're not going to help me?
210	00:13:03	00:13:08	I'll take your case.
211	00:13:08	00:13:12	I don't know whether I'll help you or not.
212	00:14:02	00:14:04	Nothing harder to investigate than arson.
213	00:14:04	00:14:07	If the fire hasn't ruined your crime scene...
214	00:14:07	00:14:08	The firemen have?
215	00:14:08	00:14:09	Mmm.
216	00:14:09	00:14:10	Funny place for a mattress.
217	00:14:10	00:14:12	Overhaul.
218	00:14:12	00:14:16	Post-blaze, firemen removed charred items to neutralize the hot spots.
219	00:14:16	00:14:18	It prevents flare-ups.
220	00:14:39	00:14:41	Looks like the kid was going camping.
221	00:14:50	00:14:52	Waterproof matches.
222	00:14:52	00:14:54	Bag those.
223	00:14:54	00:14:55	What do you think?
224	00:14:56	00:14:57	The kid might have started it?
225	00:14:59	00:15:01	We don't rule anything out.
226	00:15:01	00:15:03	Yeah.
227	00:15:16	00:15:19	Master bedroom.
228	00:15:19	00:15:23	The fire was contained inside this room...
229	00:15:25	00:15:31	but the outside doorframe is severely charred.
230	00:15:31	00:15:33	Well, fires take the path of least resistance.
231	00:15:34	00:15:36	I mean, they feed off of oxygen and combustibles.
232	00:15:36	00:15:39	We're going to take a piece of this back to the lab.
233	00:15:39	00:15:43	It's a weird place for such a thorough burn especially since the door isn't scorched.
234	00:15:43	00:15:45	Huh.
235	00:15:47	00:15:48	Look at this.
236	00:15:48	00:15:50	Rubber?
237	00:15:55	00:15:57	Firemen wear rubber gloves.
238	00:16:03	00:16:11	According to Ecklie's report, which was filed in record time the point of origin for the fire was the closet.
239	00:16:11	00:16:13	Of course, there's nothing left here.
240	00:16:15	00:16:17	More than you think.
241	00:16:17	00:16:21	V pattern on the outside wall.
242	00:16:21	00:16:24	Fires like to go up and out.
243	00:16:24	00:16:26	That's why you can always count on seeing a pattern.
244	00:16:26	00:16:27	This one's narrow.
245	00:16:28	00:16:31	This was very intense, rapidly moving fire.
246	00:16:31	00:16:35	Well, that confirms Ecklie's findings about the use of an accelerant.
247	00:16:35	00:16:40	The apex of the V usually indicates the point of origin.
248	00:16:40	00:16:42	You want to call it?
249	00:16:42	00:16:47	Damon doused the closet floor with gasoline, lit it and got the hell out of Dodge.
250	00:16:50	00:16:52	Shards of glass.
251	00:16:52	00:16:53	Bag a sample.
252	00:16:54	00:16:55	I'll put it through the lab.
253	00:16:55	00:16:56	Can't.
254	00:16:56	00:16:59	It's melted into the concrete.
255	00:17:03	00:17:04	So, that's why the concrete's discolored?
256	00:17:04	00:17:05	From the heat?
257	00:17:05	00:17:06	It's called spalling.
258	00:17:06	00:17:08	It confirms the presence of an accelerant.
259	00:17:08	00:17:12	Why would there be glass in the middle of the hot spot?
260	00:17:12	00:17:14	Who cares?
261	00:17:14	00:17:15	The guy torched his wife and kid.
262	00:17:15	00:17:18	Really?
263	00:17:18	00:17:20	Where's the trailing?
264	00:17:20	00:17:24	An arsonist would spread the gasoline around to maximize the burn area.
265	00:17:26	00:17:29	He still did the job.
266	00:17:29	00:17:31	Listen, you guys.
267	00:17:31	00:17:32	You're like Dodger fans.
268	00:17:32	00:17:36	The ball game's only in the seventh inning you're already out of your seats.
269	00:17:57	00:17:59	Mrs. Hillman?
270	00:18:02	00:18:05	Is this your son?
271	00:18:40	00:18:43	Mrs. Hillman?
272	00:18:43	00:18:45	Was your son hearing-impaired?
273	00:18:45	00:18:47	Joey was wearing a hearing aid.
274	00:18:49	00:18:50	No.
275	00:18:50	00:18:53	No, Joey's hearing was fine.
276	00:18:54	00:18:56	Why would he have that?
277	00:18:56	00:18:58	I don't know.
278	00:19:01	00:19:03	Wait a minute.
279	00:19:08	00:19:13	Danny... swore to me he'd keep Joey out of that racket.
280	00:19:15	00:19:17	Danny?
281	00:19:17	00:19:19	My older son.
282	00:19:19	00:19:20	He's a runner, too.
283	00:19:20	00:19:23	They wear remote earpieces.
284	00:19:23	00:19:26	That's how they talk to the guy they worked for.
285	00:19:26	00:19:33	We've had full-scale wars about him doing that carrying around that kind of money but does he stop?
286	00:19:33	00:19:34	No.
287	00:19:34	00:19:37	He gets Joey involved.
288	00:19:37	00:19:41	Well, the police will want to talk to your son, Danny.
289	00:19:41	00:19:43	I haven't seen him in a week.
290	00:19:43	00:19:46	And he hasn't returned my calls.
291	00:19:48	00:19:50	Do you think something's happened to him, too?
292	00:19:57	00:19:59	Grissom.
293	00:19:59	00:20:01	I'll see you guys in the evidence lab.
294	00:20:01	00:20:03	Night shift so slow you've got to pick over my cases?
295	00:20:03	00:20:06	I'm just making sure that we've answered all the questions.
296	00:20:06	00:20:07	Was it arson? Yes.
297	00:20:07	00:20:09	No doubt about it. What accelerant was used?
298	00:20:09	00:20:12	Let's see, hydrocarbon residue, and a credit card receipt.
299	00:20:12	00:20:13	Got to be gasoline. Yeah.
300	00:20:13	00:20:15	Why was there no trailing?
301	00:20:15	00:20:18	And why no evidence of an incendiary device anywhere in the bedroom?
302	00:20:18	00:20:20	He's a volunteer fireman, Gil.
303	00:20:20	00:20:22	He knows how to start a fire and hide the evidence.
304	00:20:22	00:20:27	Don't you think if this guy was remotely innocent his attorney would be involved in your little investigation?
305	00:20:27	00:20:29	What are you so afraid of, Conrad?
306	00:20:29	00:20:30	We're just a couple of science geeks.
307	00:20:31	00:20:32	Why can't we work together?
308	00:20:32	00:20:33	No, we are public servants.
309	00:20:33	00:20:36	We investigate cases as efficiently as we can and then we move on.
310	00:20:36	00:20:41	We're not a clearinghouse for defendants on the eve of trial who don't like what we've turned up.
311	00:20:41	00:20:44	Yes, we are if it's our mistake that put them there.
312	00:20:44	00:20:46	Fine, spin your wheels.
313	00:20:46	00:20:48	Hey, Eck?
314	00:20:49	00:20:52	What is the new policy on vacation days?
315	00:20:56	00:20:57	Runners, huh?
316	00:20:57	00:20:59	I know a little something about that world.
317	00:20:59	00:21:01	Yeah, we thought you might.
318	00:21:01	00:21:02	So?
319	00:21:02	00:21:03	It breaks down like this.
320	00:21:03	00:21:05	There's about a half a dozen runners in town.
321	00:21:05	00:21:08	They're mostly kids and they make about two G's a week.
322	00:21:08	00:21:10	And they all work for the same guy.
323	00:21:10	00:21:12	Well, that's more than a little something.
324	00:21:12	00:21:14	I used to be a runner in college.
325	00:21:14	00:21:16	It paid the bills.
326	00:21:16	00:21:18	I had Route Five.
327	00:21:18	00:21:21	Worked Boulder, Sunset, Vacation, and The Bay-- all of that.
328	00:21:21	00:21:23	So, who was your boss then?
329	00:21:23	00:21:24	The Voice.
330	00:21:24	00:21:26	He didn't have a name?
331	00:21:26	00:21:31	Runners go from bet to bet, they jot down their orders and they call them into The Voice.
332	00:21:31	00:21:33	Guy runs the entire operation underground.
333	00:21:33	00:21:37	I mean, he takes orders from back East and lays them off in Vegas.
334	00:21:37	00:21:39	Pockets his vig, his commission.
335	00:21:39	00:21:42	He's like the trader on the stock exchange.
336	00:21:44	00:21:46	I knew it. That's Grissom.
337	00:21:47	00:21:48	I've got to bail.
338	00:21:49	00:21:53	So... how do we find this, uh... Voice?
339	00:21:53	00:21:54	You don't.
340	00:21:54	00:21:56	He's not who you're looking for anyway.
341	00:21:56	00:21:59	If you want to know who capped this kid then you should talk to another runner.
342	00:21:59	00:22:02	I mean, they'll kill each other for a good route.
343	00:22:08	00:22:13	Uh... you might want to take three giant steps backward.
344	00:22:13	00:22:15	What's going on? Danger, Will Robinson.
345	00:22:15	00:22:23	Three drops of gasoline, limited oxygen supply heat to ignition temperature of 932 degrees Fahrenheit.
346	00:22:23	00:22:25	Same conditions in Damon's bedroom the night of the fire.
347	00:22:29	00:22:31	Smoke to fire.
348	00:22:31	00:22:32	Flashover.
349	00:22:32	00:22:34	So, that confirms the first part of Damon's story.
350	00:22:34	00:22:37	Tell me you're here to confirm part two.
351	00:22:37	00:22:40	As a matter of fact, here is your doorframe.
352	00:22:43	00:22:45	I had Collins analyze the burn depth.
353	00:22:45	00:22:47	You see these rolling blisters?
354	00:22:47	00:22:48	It's called alligatoring.
355	00:22:48	00:22:49	See the way the wood's cracked?
356	00:22:49	00:22:51	It looks like the skin of an alligator.
357	00:22:51	00:22:53	Based on the depth of the allir... allo...
358	00:22:53	00:22:55	Alligatoring.
359	00:22:55	00:22:58	This wood burned very hot and very fast.
360	00:22:58	00:23:00	Use of accelerant? Negative.
361	00:23:00	00:23:04	But that piece was a doorframe outside of the bedroom-- which was a contained site.
362	00:23:04	00:23:07	So, the only way this could've happened was...
363	00:23:07	00:23:08	O2.
364	00:23:18	00:23:19	Damon opened the door.
365	00:23:21	00:23:22	He lied.
366	00:23:25	00:23:26	So, what happens now?
367	00:23:26	00:23:28	We chase the lie...
368	00:23:28	00:23:30	till it leads to the truth.
369	00:23:45	00:23:47	All right. You take care.
370	00:23:47	00:23:48	And don't-don't worry.
371	00:23:48	00:23:50	Everything's going to be fine.
372	00:23:59	00:24:00	That's my sister.
373	00:24:00	00:24:04	She's the only one who stood by me in all of this.
374	00:24:06	00:24:08	Anything else you want to tell me?
375	00:24:08	00:24:11	What, about my sister?
376	00:24:12	00:24:15	About the fire.
377	00:24:15	00:24:17	I...
378	00:24:17	00:24:19	I told you everything.
379	00:24:19	00:24:22	Your bedroom doorframe disagrees.
380	00:24:22	00:24:25	If no one opened the door...
381	00:24:25	00:24:28	the outside frame would not have burned.
382	00:24:28	00:24:32	As a firefighter you know that.
383	00:24:34	00:24:36	May I see your hand, please?
384	00:24:36	00:24:38	Palm up.
385	00:24:46	00:24:50	This is the same type of doorknob that you have on your bedroom door.
386	00:25:02	00:25:04	Mr. Damon...
387	00:25:06	00:25:09	Please...
388	00:25:09	00:25:12	I don't want anyone to know.
389	00:25:12	00:25:14	Why?
390	00:25:14	00:25:16	This places you outside of the fire.
391	00:25:16	00:25:20	You're facing the death penalty.
392	00:25:20	00:25:22	Why are you lying?
393	00:25:24	00:25:27	I'm a firefighter.
394	00:25:27	00:25:33	And when my wife and my son needed me...
395	00:25:36	00:25:40	I forgot everything.
396	00:25:40	00:25:41	I didn't check for heat.
397	00:25:41	00:25:42	Jeannie!
398	00:25:42	00:25:43	I didn't look for smoke.
399	00:25:43	00:25:47	All I could think about was getting them out.
400	00:25:47	00:25:49	So I opened the door...
401	00:25:49	00:25:51	and I let the monster out.
402	00:25:51	00:25:53	I could just about make them out through the flame.
403	00:25:53	00:25:55	Jeannie! Jeannie!
404	00:25:55	00:25:57	But I... I couldn't get to them!
405	00:25:57	00:25:58	Oh!
406	00:26:01	00:26:03	What else?
407	00:26:03	00:26:05	I had to close the door.
408	00:26:05	00:26:09	The whole house would've gone up and the firemen would have never reached them.
409	00:26:11	00:26:15	I killed my family.
410	00:26:16	00:26:21	Carbon monoxide killed them long before the fire got to them.
411	00:26:21	00:26:22	You know about CO2 poisoning.
412	00:26:22	00:26:24	It doesn't matter what I know.
413	00:26:24	00:26:27	My family died because I wasn't there to protect them.
414	00:26:29	00:26:35	You tried to save your family but that doesn't mean that you didn't start the fire.
415	00:26:35	00:26:41	Are you lying about that, too?
416	00:26:41	00:26:44	You tell me.
417	00:26:46	00:26:50	I will.
418	00:26:50	00:26:53	Hey, you didn't hear this from me, all right? But, um...
419	00:26:54	00:26:59	you see the guy over there-- blue sweatshirt with the orange hood?
420	00:26:59	00:27:00	702.
421	00:27:00	00:27:02	He's a runner.
422	00:27:02	00:27:05	He used to hang with 517-- the kid who was killed.
423	00:27:05	00:27:07	He's not talking to himself, is he?
424	00:27:07	00:27:09	Talking to his boss on a wire.
425	00:27:09	00:27:12	It's illegal to use two-way communication in the sportsbook.
426	00:27:12	00:27:14	As long as you don't get caught.
427	00:27:14	00:27:16	I've got to get back to work.
428	00:27:19	00:27:21	Lakers are minus 11.
429	00:27:21	00:27:22	The total is 189.
430	00:27:23	00:27:24	Yeah. Bulls pick.
431	00:27:24	00:27:27	Kings are down to nine from eleven.
432	00:27:32	00:27:34	Done.
433	00:27:35	00:27:36	Lakers.
434	00:27:36	00:27:37	$50,000.
435	00:27:37	00:27:39	Give me as much at 11 as you can.
436	00:27:39	00:27:41	You like the Lakers today?
437	00:27:44	00:27:46	So do I.
438	00:27:46	00:27:49	Yeah, Joey Hillman, 517.
439	00:27:49	00:27:51	Yeah, he was a good kid.
440	00:27:51	00:27:53	It's too bad about him getting shot.
441	00:27:53	00:27:56	Yeah, I guess all the runners heard about it by now, huh?
442	00:27:56	00:27:58	I guess.
443	00:27:58	00:27:59	So, who got Joey's route?
444	00:27:59	00:28:00	I don't know.
445	00:28:00	00:28:02	The only thing I know is my own route.
446	00:28:02	00:28:04	What was Joey's route, exactly?
447	00:28:04	00:28:07	You guys are asking a lot questions here for not being cops, huh?
448	00:28:07	00:28:11	Are you interested in helping us better understand Joey's crime scene, or...
449	00:28:11	00:28:12	...not?
450	00:28:12	00:28:15	I only know what I see on the news.
451	00:28:17	00:28:19	Later.
452	00:28:43	00:28:44	You got me.
453	00:28:45	00:28:46	Sorry.
454	00:28:46	00:28:47	What are you doing here?
455	00:28:47	00:28:49	Sifting through this debris.
456	00:28:49	00:28:51	You mind?
457	00:28:51	00:28:53	No.
458	00:28:53	00:28:55	Give me a hand with this mattress.
459	00:29:12	00:29:14	Space heater.
460	00:29:15	00:29:18	Janko Electric, Model...
461	00:29:18	00:29:19	...220.
462	00:29:19	00:29:20	Or it was.
463	00:29:20	00:29:25	I figure it must have burned up in the bedroom and the firemen threw it out here with the rest of this overhaul.
464	00:29:25	00:29:28	This is heavy-duty, high voltage.
465	00:29:28	00:29:31	This thing could heat our whole lab.
466	00:29:31	00:29:33	Or overload a house.
467	00:29:35	00:29:37	Breaker box.
468	00:29:39	00:29:41	Circuit overload.
469	00:29:41	00:29:42	The master bedroom.
470	00:29:42	00:29:45	You know what to do next?
471	00:29:45	00:29:48	Yeah.
472	00:29:56	00:29:59	The condensation inside Joey's back seat window is nasal mucus.
473	00:29:59	00:30:00	From a sneeze. Most likely.
474	00:30:00	00:30:01	You're thinking...
475	00:30:01	00:30:03	the shooter was in the back seat?
476	00:30:03	00:30:04	Mm-hmm, with the sniffles.
477	00:30:04	00:30:05	Mm-hmm.
478	00:30:05	00:30:07	So what is the DNA like in mucus these days?
479	00:30:07	00:30:09	It's pretty good.
480	00:30:09	00:30:10	I'll start a DNA profile.
481	00:30:10	00:30:11	Thanks.
482	00:30:11	00:30:13	Catherine?
483	00:30:13	00:30:14	Oh, hi, David.
484	00:30:14	00:30:15	What's up?
485	00:30:15	00:30:17	There's someone waiting for you in reception.
486	00:30:21	00:30:22	Detective?
487	00:30:24	00:30:26	She came in with her son.
488	00:30:26	00:30:29	Thought you'd like a conversation before we sat down with him.
489	00:30:29	00:30:32	Yeah, thanks.
490	00:30:32	00:30:33	Did you call Nick?
491	00:30:33	00:30:34	Yeah.
492	00:30:34	00:30:37	Uh... come on.
493	00:30:37	00:30:39	This is my son, Danny.
494	00:30:39	00:30:41	He heard about Joey and came home.
495	00:30:43	00:30:47	So, I took some of my runner money and I hit the blackjack tables.
496	00:30:47	00:30:50	I lost...
497	00:30:50	00:30:52	so I doubled up.
498	00:30:52	00:30:55	I ended up losing 30 grand in eight minutes.
499	00:30:55	00:30:56	Well, I can see why you ran.
500	00:30:57	00:30:58	I was scared.
501	00:30:58	00:31:01	You know, it wasn't my money.
502	00:31:01	00:31:04	Did you think to get back to your boss?
503	00:31:04	00:31:05	Try to make amends?
504	00:31:07	00:31:09	You guys don't even know who your boss is, do you?
505	00:31:09	00:31:14	Did you tell Joey to get out of town, that someone might try to harm him?
506	00:31:14	00:31:15	On behalf of your boss?
507	00:31:15	00:31:17	I should have.
508	00:31:17	00:31:18	But, no...
509	00:31:18	00:31:21	I only worried about my butt.
510	00:31:21	00:31:24	They killed Joey to send a message to me.
511	00:31:26	00:31:28	Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
512	00:31:31	00:31:33	Danny...
513	00:31:33	00:31:37	...do you have any idea who shot your brother?
514	00:31:37	00:31:39	One of the runners.
515	00:31:40	00:31:41	Probably a guy...
516	00:31:41	00:31:42	No!
517	00:31:42	00:31:44	No. No names.
518	00:31:45	00:31:48	One of them killed Joey.
519	00:31:48	00:31:50	You know, they'll do anything for money.
520	00:31:50	00:31:52	It's like a-a disease.
521	00:31:52	00:31:54	And if you talk, they'll come after you.
522	00:31:54	00:31:55	No.
523	00:31:55	00:31:58	No, I'm not losing another child.
524	00:31:58	00:32:00	Joey died because of me.
525	00:32:00	00:32:02	Either they find his shooter, or I do.
526	00:32:02	00:32:04	Whoa, whoa!
527	00:32:04	00:32:05	Hold on, now.
528	00:32:05	00:32:07	Nobody's going after anybody.
529	00:32:07	00:32:10	Okay, he doesn't have to give us a name, Ms. Hillman, all right?
530	00:32:11	00:32:14	Danny, you wear an earpiece, right?
531	00:32:14	00:32:17	Just give us the frequency your runners operate on.
532	00:32:30	00:32:32	What the hell are you doing?
533	00:32:32	00:32:34	Something you probably should have done.
534	00:32:34	00:32:37	You're checking for faulty wiring?
535	00:32:37	00:32:38	Waste of time, Gil.
536	00:32:39	00:32:42	The fire started on the floor in the closet not in the wires in the wall.
537	00:32:42	00:32:43	Yeah, that was your report.
538	00:32:44	00:32:48	This is an electrical socket from the closet where a space heater was plugged in.
539	00:32:48	00:32:49	A heater?
540	00:32:49	00:32:51	There was no heater there.
541	00:32:51	00:32:53	I found it in the living room, melted.
542	00:32:53	00:32:57	And I suppose you happen to know which outlet it was plugged into?
543	00:32:57	00:32:58	It was a cold night.
544	00:32:58	00:33:01	The outlet in the closet was closest to her bed.
545	00:33:01	00:33:04	That's a little far-fetched, don't you think?
546	00:33:04	00:33:05	Look...
547	00:33:05	00:33:12	if this wire burned from the inside out then the fire started in the wall not on the closet floor.
548	00:33:16	00:33:19	Discoloration throughout the conductor.
549	00:33:19	00:33:21	It burned from the inside out.
550	00:33:21	00:33:25	The cause of this fire was an electrical overload in the wall.
551	00:33:25	00:33:26	All right, you say wall, I say floor.
552	00:33:27	00:33:28	We differ on points of origin.
553	00:33:30	00:33:31	gasoline.
554	00:33:31	00:33:32	Speaking of which...
555	00:33:32	00:33:33	where's your accelerant analysis work?
556	00:33:33	00:33:40	I personally swabbed the closet floor found traces of hydrocarbon chains confirming gasoline.
557	00:33:40	00:33:43	Leave it alone, Gil.
558	00:33:43	00:33:44	The D.A. agrees with me on this.
559	00:33:44	00:33:46	Too many unanswered questions, Conrad.
560	00:33:46	00:33:49	This case should not be going to trial yet.
561	00:33:49	00:33:50	No, there's only one unanswered question.
562	00:33:51	00:33:53	Why was there accelerant in the closet?
563	00:33:53	00:33:55	Only one person knows.
564	00:33:55	00:33:58	And that's why he's looking at the death penalty.
565	00:34:01	00:34:03	Look, I told you...
566	00:34:03	00:34:05	I don't know why it was there.
567	00:34:05	00:34:06	You've got to do better than that.
568	00:34:07	00:34:07	I can't!
569	00:34:08	00:34:10	It doesn't prove you didn't start it.
570	00:34:10	00:34:15	Until we can explain why there was gasoline in the bedroom closet the charges stand.
571	00:34:18	00:34:19	Then I guess I'm a dead man.
572	00:34:28	00:34:30	Hey, this is bull.
573	00:34:30	00:34:32	I thought I was showing up to win a trip.
574	00:34:32	00:34:33	Oh...
575	00:34:33	00:34:35	one of you's going to win a trip, all right.
576	00:34:35	00:34:37	Everybody clear, this is voluntary?
577	00:34:37	00:34:40	Yeah, sure, then she just calls the cops to come and arrest us.
578	00:34:40	00:34:43	So everyone is clear.
579	00:34:43	00:34:44	Yeah.
580	00:34:44	00:34:45	Yeah.
581	00:34:45	00:34:47	Okay...
582	00:34:47	00:34:49	here's what we're going to do.
583	00:34:50	00:34:52	Open your nostrils.
584	00:34:52	00:34:56	You know, look, I got a hundred bucks that says none of us are the shooter.
585	00:34:56	00:35:00	Well, if you're that confident it's not one of your guys you must know who it is.
586	00:35:00	00:35:03	Even if I did, you think I would tell you?
587	00:35:03	00:35:07	You're on Cool Breeze. A hundred bucks.
588	00:35:07	00:35:09	Okay.
589	00:35:12	00:35:14	Head back.
590	00:35:44	00:35:47	Okay. You're all free to go.
591	00:35:47	00:35:49	This way, gents.
592	00:35:49	00:35:51	You owe me a C-note, baby.
593	00:35:51	00:35:52	I don't have it on me.
594	00:35:52	00:35:54	I'll have to bring it to you.
595	00:35:54	00:35:56	Okay, I'll be holding my breath.
596	00:35:56	00:35:58	Mm-hmm.
597	00:35:59	00:36:02	Ugh!
598	00:36:06	00:36:08	Counting matches?
599	00:36:09	00:36:11	Yeah.
600	00:36:11	00:36:14	From the kid's room.
601	00:36:14	00:36:16	I counted them yesterday.
602	00:36:16	00:36:18	And I counted them this morning.
603	00:36:18	00:36:19	Twenty.
604	00:36:19	00:36:20	They're all there.
605	00:36:25	00:36:28	I really don't know what I'm doing anymore.
606	00:36:28	00:36:30	I got a theory.
607	00:36:30	00:36:32	You want to hear it?
608	00:36:32	00:36:33	Sure.
609	00:36:33	00:36:36	You know the melted shards of glass we found on the closet floor?
610	00:36:36	00:36:40	They prove that the fire burned at over 1,000 degrees, right?
611	00:36:40	00:36:46	But that temp, combined with the water used to douse the flames would have destroyed most of the accelerant.
612	00:36:46	00:36:48	That's what happens.
613	00:36:48	00:36:52	So, Ecklie's conclusion of gasoline wasn't based on any physical evidence.
614	00:36:52	00:36:55	It was based on Damon's credit card receipts.
615	00:36:55	00:36:56	I can't fault him for that.
616	00:36:56	00:36:58	The burn pattern is consistent with a gasoline accelerant.
617	00:36:58	00:36:59	But...
618	00:37:00	00:37:03	oils...
619	00:37:03	00:37:09	kerosene, polyethylene- based compounds like laxatives, even the foam used in push-up bras.
620	00:37:09	00:37:14	Yeah, under the right conditions any hydro-carb can be an accelerant.
621	00:37:14	00:37:15	Thank you.
622	00:37:15	00:37:17	Warrick, you're driving.
623	00:37:19	00:37:21	You ever worry about professional suicide?
624	00:37:21	00:37:24	Not while I'm committing it, no.
625	00:37:39	00:37:40	Crime scene cleanup.
626	00:37:41	00:37:44	Let's go.
627	00:37:47	00:37:49	You son of a bitch.
628	00:37:49	00:37:50	You swept my crime scene.
629	00:37:50	00:37:51	You sent cleanup!
630	00:37:51	00:37:54	I didn't send anyone.
631	00:37:54	00:37:56	It's been on the books for months.
632	00:37:56	00:37:58	You knew, and did nothing about it even with a man's life on the line?
633	00:37:58	00:38:03	If you'd checked the docket like everybody else you would've known what was happening.
634	00:38:03	00:38:04	Coffee?
635	00:38:07	00:38:09	Guess you don't want cream with that.
636	00:38:29	00:38:32	Thanks, Ecklie.
637	00:38:36	00:38:38	Hi.
638	00:38:38	00:38:39	Hi.
639	00:38:39	00:38:41	Excuse me.
640	00:38:41	00:38:42	My name's Gil Grissom.
641	00:38:42	00:38:45	I know. You're helping Frank. Thank you.
642	00:38:45	00:38:46	May I ask you a question?
643	00:38:46	00:38:49	Sure. Anything to help Frank.
644	00:38:49	00:38:52	You're his family.
645	00:38:52	00:38:54	What was his relationship like with his wife and son?
646	00:38:55	00:38:59	Frank was a wonderful father.
647	00:38:59	00:39:01	Toby adored him.
648	00:39:01	00:39:03	Uh, I'm sorry.
649	00:39:03	00:39:07	I, um... I have to get back to work.
650	00:39:07	00:39:09	But thank you.
651	00:39:16	00:39:18	I broke a coffee pot today.
652	00:39:19	00:39:20	Lost my temper.
653	00:39:21	00:39:23	Anything like that ever happen to you?
654	00:39:25	00:39:30	We found shards of melted glass on the floor of your closet.
655	00:39:30	00:39:32	You want to tell me about it?
656	00:39:34	00:39:36	Okay, you can explain it in court.
657	00:39:36	00:39:39	It's all part of the report now.
658	00:39:51	00:39:56	I didn't leave that night to buy ice cream.
659	00:39:58	00:39:59	I was leaving Jeannie.
660	00:39:59	00:40:00	I warned you.
661	00:40:00	00:40:01	It's just a few things.
662	00:40:01	00:40:03	It is half the damn state!
663	00:40:03	00:40:04	I told you this was the last time.
664	00:40:04	00:40:05	Going to leave us now?
665	00:40:05	00:40:07	I'm leaving. You can be broke by yourself!
666	00:40:07	00:40:10	You want to leave? Fine, okay?
667	00:40:10	00:40:12	Get out! What the hell are you doing?
668	00:40:12	00:40:14	So I just got the hell out of there.
669	00:40:14	00:40:20	Drove for about 20 minutes and then thought, how could I end ten years of our life like that?
670	00:40:20	00:40:22	I mean, we had a son, so I turned around.
671	00:40:22	00:40:24	Wait a minute. Go back.
672	00:40:24	00:40:27	What did she throw at you?
673	00:40:27	00:40:28	Be specific.
674	00:40:28	00:40:29	Man, I just ducked and covered.
675	00:40:30	00:40:31	I don't remember.
676	00:40:31	00:40:32	Think.
677	00:40:32	00:40:36	Uh... a-a phone.
678	00:40:36	00:40:38	A-A bag.
679	00:40:39	00:40:40	Uh, a vase maybe.
680	00:40:40	00:40:41	What kind of a vase?
681	00:40:41	00:40:43	A flower vase?
682	00:40:43	00:40:44	I don't remember any flowers.
683	00:40:44	00:40:46	Was it even a vase?
684	00:40:46	00:40:47	Look, I don't know.
685	00:40:47	00:40:48	I can't remember.
686	00:40:49	00:40:50	Was it glass?
687	00:40:50	00:40:52	Could it have been glass?
688	00:40:52	00:40:54	Yes.
689	00:40:54	00:40:55	It was glass.
690	00:40:56	00:40:59	It was a glass lamp, because it had a wick.
691	00:40:59	00:41:01	Get out! What the hell are you doing?
692	00:41:01	00:41:01	Get out!
693	00:41:02	00:41:02	I'm leaving!
694	00:41:02	00:41:04	Just get out!
695	00:41:04	00:41:06	Like a kerosene lamp?
696	00:41:06	00:41:08	Yeah, she bought a lamp like that.
697	00:41:08	00:41:10	I found kerosene on the floor of your closet.
698	00:41:11	00:41:16	I think the space heater overloaded the circuit causing a spark to ignite the kerosene.
699	00:41:16	00:41:19	Can you prove it?
700	00:41:19	00:41:20	In court?
701	00:41:20	00:41:23	The evidence can.
702	00:41:33	00:41:35	Hey, how you doing?
703	00:41:35	00:41:36	Hey.
704	00:41:36	00:41:37	Who do you want?
705	00:41:37	00:41:40	The runner... um, 702.
706	00:41:41	00:41:42	I owe him a little cash.
707	00:41:42	00:41:46	Uh, this isn't the only place he hangs out but if you want me to give it to him...
708	00:41:46	00:41:47	Um...
709	00:41:47	00:41:49	you have an envelope I could use?
710	00:41:49	00:41:50	Yeah.
711	00:41:54	00:41:55	Nice watch.
712	00:41:55	00:41:57	Thanks.
713	00:41:57	00:41:59	Thought you were getting out of this business.
714	00:41:59	00:42:01	Yeah, uh... it's my last day.
715	00:42:01	00:42:03	Got a new job.
716	00:42:03	00:42:05	Later.
717	00:42:05	00:42:06	Yeah.
718	00:42:23	00:42:26	You're out of business, Joey.
719	00:42:31	00:42:33	New job, huh?
720	00:42:33	00:42:36	Joey's old route?
721	00:42:38	00:42:44	Did you get so scared when you shot him that you forgot the money?
722	00:42:44	00:42:46	I want a lawyer.
723	00:42:46	00:42:50	Well, you better get one that knows forensics...
724	00:42:52	00:42:53	'cause we got you.
725	00:42:53	00:42:56	Dispatch, Victor 19.
726	00:42:56	00:42:59	Code 462 on the 4-20 suspect Monaco.
727	00:43:08	00:43:10	Thought you might need a ride.
728	00:43:10	00:43:13	No. Thanks.
729	00:43:13	00:43:15	I'm okay.
730	00:43:15	00:43:19	Your sister.
