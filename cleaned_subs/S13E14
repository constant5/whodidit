8,00:00:56,00:00:58,(light applause)
9,00:00:58,00:01:00,"Bravo, Silvana, save some of that for opening night."
10,00:01:00,00:01:02,Silvana's on fire.
11,00:01:02,00:01:03,"We're gonna make some money, bro."
12,00:01:03,00:01:06,Good for you... and for your club.
13,00:01:06,00:01:08,"Well, good for all of us, right?"
14,00:01:08,00:01:10,"This is not about the money for me, bro."
15,00:01:10,00:01:13,It's about the soul of Cuba.
16,00:01:13,00:01:14,The music.
17,00:01:14,00:01:15,(Silvana speaking Spanish)
18,00:01:15,00:01:17,Venga.
19,00:01:17,00:01:20,"Cuidado, Vegas, Silvana has arrived."
20,00:01:20,00:01:22,Vegas is just the beginning.
21,00:01:22,00:01:23,"Sure, sure, sure."
22,00:01:23,00:01:24,Necesitamos hablar press.
23,00:01:24,00:01:28,"We do the local news, and after the first show, CNN, Fox, MSNBC."
24,00:01:28,00:01:30,The sky's the limit. Come on.
25,00:01:32,00:01:34,(conversing in Spanish)
26,00:01:34,00:01:36,Marta!
27,00:01:38,00:01:39,(sobbing): Marta...!
28,00:01:39,00:01:41,No!
29,00:01:41,00:01:43,"Oh, Marta...!"
30,00:01:43,00:01:44,(camera clicking)
31,00:01:44,00:01:46,"(indistinct radio communication, sirens wailing in distance)"
32,00:01:46,00:01:47,Thank you.
33,00:01:47,00:01:53,"Hey, fellas, what do we got? Marta Cuerto, 32, Cuban national."
34,00:01:53,00:01:57,"Sister to Silvana Cuerto, Cuban pop star."
35,00:01:57,00:01:58,Who found the body?
36,00:01:58,00:02:00,Silvana and her manager.
37,00:02:00,00:02:03,"So, no signs of a disturbance."
38,00:02:03,00:02:07,"No blood, no cleanup, which means this isn't the primary."
39,00:02:07,00:02:16,"The body was staged, just like that, and one of Silvana's costumes was taken off the rack and put on the victim's body."
40,00:02:16,00:02:19,That explains the lack of blood on the dress.
41,00:02:19,00:02:20,"What do we got going here, bud?"
42,00:02:20,00:02:24,Blunt force trauma-- the face and most of her upper torso.
43,00:02:24,00:02:28,Semicircular impressions all over the body.
44,00:02:28,00:02:31,(thermometer beeps) Liver temp is 90.4.
45,00:02:31,00:02:33,She died about six hours ago.
46,00:02:34,00:02:36,I'll get the gurney.
47,00:02:36,00:02:40,"So our killer brings her here, stages the body..."
48,00:02:40,00:02:42,nobody even notices?
49,00:02:42,00:02:45,She was rehearsing for a couple of hours onstage.
50,00:02:45,00:02:47,"The music's loud, people are distracted."
51,00:02:47,00:02:49,How many ways in and out of here? Only two.
52,00:02:49,00:02:54,"Door from the stage, and there's a back door down that hallway leading to the alley."
53,00:02:54,00:02:56,"Well, that's the how; I'd like to know the why."
54,00:02:56,00:02:57,Silvana's sister...
55,00:02:59,00:03:03,"...in her dress, sitting at her vanity..."
56,00:03:04,00:03:06,...staring into her mirror.
57,00:03:11,00:03:13,You got something?
58,00:03:13,00:03:14,Yeah.
59,00:03:34,00:03:36,"""Silvana, eres la proxima""?"
60,00:03:38,00:04:18,"""Silvana, you're next."" (protesters chanting in Spanish)"
61,00:04:21,00:04:24,SANDERS: Silvana Cuerto is the hottest ticket in Vegas.
62,00:04:24,00:04:26,Next to...
63,00:04:26,00:04:29,"rum and cigars, Silvana is Cuba's biggest export."
64,00:04:29,00:04:31,"So, how come I've never heard of her, then?"
65,00:04:31,00:04:35,"I don't know, I mean, she's been touring Europe, now she's finally coming to the States."
66,00:04:35,00:04:38,Didn't know you were such a big Cuban music fan.
67,00:04:38,00:04:44,"You know, Sex Pistols, Sinatra, Silvana-- I'm equal opportunity like that."
68,00:04:44,00:04:48,"If she's so popular, why are all these people here protesting?"
69,00:04:51,00:04:54,"I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Cuerto."
70,00:04:54,00:04:57,It's like... part of me is dead.
71,00:04:57,00:04:59,I do have to ask you some questions.
72,00:04:59,00:05:01,I'm sorry. I understand.
73,00:05:01,00:05:04,I know that you and your manager found your sister Marta.
74,00:05:04,00:05:05,Right?
75,00:05:05,00:05:09,"Was there anyone else backstage, anyone who didn't belong? No, just us."
76,00:05:09,00:05:11,When was the last time you saw Marta?
77,00:05:11,00:05:12,Yesterday.
78,00:05:12,00:05:15,"We had lunch, then she went shopping."
79,00:05:15,00:05:16,Shopping?
80,00:05:16,00:05:18,Marta does wardrobe for the show.
81,00:05:18,00:05:21,She made all of my costumes.
82,00:05:23,00:05:25,"My whole life, she's taken care of me."
83,00:05:25,00:05:28,"And coming here, I was so scared."
84,00:05:30,00:05:33,But Marta gave me the strength.
85,00:05:33,00:05:39,"She was so happy for me, like it was her up in that stage..."
86,00:05:39,00:05:42,and I felt her with me.
87,00:05:44,00:05:46,Did your sister mention receiving threats?
88,00:05:46,00:05:49,Everyone loved Marta.
89,00:05:49,00:05:50,"Okay, how about you?"
90,00:05:50,00:05:52,Have you received any threats?
91,00:05:52,00:05:57,"MANAGER: Silvana received threats every day, ever since we arrive in this country."
92,00:05:57,00:06:06,"Threats from whom, Mr. Ficha? Los Gusanos-- the so-called Cuban exiles who want Silvana to go home or die."
93,00:06:06,00:06:07,You're talking about the people outside.
94,00:06:07,00:06:09,That's right.
95,00:06:09,00:06:11,It's a long way from carrying a sign to killing someone.
96,00:06:11,00:06:13,I don't expect you to understand.
97,00:06:13,00:06:17,Politics in your country is entertainment.
98,00:06:17,00:06:21,"In Cuba, it's passion; it's blood."
99,00:06:21,00:06:25,These threats against Silvana-- were they anonymous?
100,00:06:25,00:06:30,"The threats, yes... the source... no."
101,00:06:30,00:06:31,What do you mean by that?
102,00:06:31,00:06:41,"The leader of the exile community-- Eddie Santos-- he's been following us ever since we landed-- outside the hotel, outside the restaurant where we eat, outside this club. Why didn't you report him?"
103,00:06:41,00:06:44,I did-- to your State Department.
104,00:06:44,00:06:48,"Obviously, your government is deaf to the concerns of the loyal Cuban citizens."
105,00:06:48,00:06:50,Some more loyal than others.
106,00:06:50,00:07:03,"Hmm. Couldn't help but notice on your passport there's an entry-- ""Gobierno Cubano."" My Spanish is a little rusty, but I'm pretty sure that means ""Cuban government."" You're not just Silvana's manager, are you?"
107,00:07:03,00:07:08,"I was assigned to accompany Silvana on her tour-- Marta, too."
108,00:07:08,00:07:10,You're a handler.
109,00:07:10,00:07:11,"Yeah, that makes sense."
110,00:07:11,00:07:17,"I mean, a talent like Silvana-- you're the guy assigned to make sure that she, uh... finds her way back home."
111,00:07:17,00:07:22,Perhaps if I had been more vigilant...
112,00:07:22,00:07:24,Marta would still be alive.
113,00:07:24,00:07:28,Got black streaks on the floor here.
114,00:07:34,00:07:36,Looks like some kind of oil residue.
115,00:07:37,00:07:39,I've got a fiber here.
116,00:07:39,00:07:41,Could help us find our primary.
117,00:07:43,00:07:47,More fibers at the base of the chair.
118,00:07:51,00:07:53,There's a trail heading right out of the room.
119,00:07:55,00:07:59,And down the hallway to the door to the alley.
120,00:07:59,00:08:01,You thinking what I'm thinking?
121,00:08:01,00:08:06,"When fibers get snagged on the floor like that, it means material was dragged."
122,00:08:06,00:08:10,SANDERS: Weighed down like a body in some kind of sack.
123,00:08:11,00:08:13,Body dump.
124,00:08:14,00:08:17,But where did the killer stash the sack?
125,00:08:24,00:08:25,What are the odds?
126,00:08:35,00:08:38,(sighs)
127,00:08:38,00:08:41,"SIDLE: So much for security at your club, Mr. Mejia."
128,00:08:41,00:08:48,"In fact, the only functioning camera in this entire club that's working is aimed at the cash register behind the bar."
129,00:08:48,00:08:50,"Kind of sums up your priorities, don't you think?"
130,00:08:50,00:08:51,You're out of line.
131,00:08:51,00:08:52,I don't think so.
132,00:08:52,00:08:55,"Given what I saw outside, you have no excuse for not providing adequate security."
133,00:08:55,00:08:57,I tried.
134,00:08:57,00:08:59,I installed these cameras this month.
135,00:08:59,00:09:05,"I've had to fix 'em four times already. Ever since I announced that Silvana was performing at the club, I've had acts of vandalism every night."
136,00:09:05,00:09:07,You're pointing a finger at the exiles?
137,00:09:07,00:09:13,"All I'm saying is, I don't get how people who are otherwise calm and law-abiding can go crazy over ancient history, wounds that are over 50 years old."
138,00:09:13,00:09:15,Aren't you Cuban?
139,00:09:15,00:09:17,Cuban-American.
140,00:09:17,00:09:19,"My parents and I came here 20 years ago, when I was 11."
141,00:09:19,00:09:21,"This is my country, not Cuba."
142,00:09:21,00:09:23,My generation-- here.
143,00:09:23,00:09:25,Marta's and Silvana's-- over there.
144,00:09:25,00:09:28,"We just want to be free to live our lives, follow our dreams."
145,00:09:28,00:09:36,"Yeah, well, somebody ended that for Marta Cuerto, and Silvana may be next, so, if this show must go on, then you have to fix these cameras."
146,00:09:36,00:09:39,"(mellow, upbeat Cuban music playing)"
147,00:09:41,00:09:42,"Beautiful music, Doc."
148,00:09:42,00:09:45,"(player beeps off) Oh, brings back memories."
149,00:09:45,00:09:46,Have you been to Cuba?
150,00:09:46,00:09:47,15 years ago.
151,00:09:47,00:09:51,I was invited to a symposium on forensic pathology in Havana.
152,00:09:51,00:09:53,"Hmm, you must have some good stories."
153,00:09:53,00:09:55,"Actually, that's why I called you here."
154,00:09:55,00:09:56,But this story is far from good.
155,00:09:56,00:10:00,This pattern of injuries is quite specific and not new to me.
156,00:10:00,00:10:02,What do you mean?
157,00:10:02,00:10:05,Injuries on the wrists indicate the victim was forcibly restrained.
158,00:10:05,00:10:06,Ligature marks.
159,00:10:06,00:10:09,Width suggests rope.
160,00:10:09,00:10:11,Same ligature marks on her ankles.
161,00:10:11,00:10:16,Slight bruising on her shoulders from a hyperextension of the muscles.
162,00:10:16,00:10:23,And this bruising on her abdomen says the victim was subjected to an extended period of intense pressure.
163,00:10:23,00:10:25,Which all adds up to what?
164,00:10:25,00:10:27,She was hog-tied.
165,00:10:27,00:10:30,"(moaning, screaming)"
166,00:10:30,00:10:36,So you're saying systematic torture? I met a journalist in Cuba who claimed to have been arrested by the authorities.
167,00:10:36,00:10:45,"He described an account of torture referred to as ""la silla."" Which means ""the chair."" According to him, it was a technique commonly employed by the Cuban police."
168,00:10:45,00:10:52,"After a few hours, they lifted him off the floor, tied him to a chair, and beat him into submission with a pipe."
169,00:10:52,00:10:56,The pipe would be consistent with the semicircular gashes all over her body.
170,00:10:56,00:10:57,Do you have anything else?
171,00:10:57,00:10:59,"Well, no obvious signs of sexual assault."
172,00:10:59,00:11:01,I sent the SAE kit to DNA.
173,00:11:01,00:11:03,But I did find this...
174,00:11:03,00:11:08,partially embedded in the skin of her left heel.
175,00:11:08,00:11:10,FINLAY: Hmm.
176,00:11:10,00:11:11,Looks like some kind of metal.
177,00:11:16,00:11:18,Whoa. Lurk much?
178,00:11:18,00:11:22,"You know, if you weren't my boss and dating my mother, I'd say I hate that."
179,00:11:22,00:11:24,"Well, I'm not too happy myself, Depardieu."
180,00:11:24,00:11:26,"Or I guess you're really Andie MacDowell, aren't you?"
181,00:11:26,00:11:28,What are you talking about?
182,00:11:28,00:11:30,"Green Card, the movie."
183,00:11:30,00:11:32,Saw it with Morgan's mother.
184,00:11:32,00:11:35,"At least the first 15 minutes, before I got paged to an even worse crime."
185,00:11:35,00:11:38,Right. This is about the immigration investigation?
186,00:11:38,00:11:40,"Yes, it is."
187,00:11:40,00:11:41,What the hell were you thinking?
188,00:11:41,00:11:45,"What do you mean? You meet a woman in Italy and a week later, you're engaged?"
189,00:11:45,00:11:46,You don't even speak the same damn language.
190,00:11:46,00:11:48,Which has its advantages.
191,00:11:48,00:11:50,"All right, you think this is funny?"
192,00:11:50,00:11:54,This is Morgan's deposition... supporting your story.
193,00:11:54,00:11:56,I know; I didn't ask her to do that.
194,00:11:56,00:11:58,"I'm your supervisor, David; we're family here."
195,00:11:58,00:12:00,You should've told me.
196,00:12:00,00:12:03,And you sure as hell should've told your mother-- she's beside herself.
197,00:12:03,00:12:06,Default position.
198,00:12:06,00:12:08,That's not funny.
199,00:12:08,00:12:10,My daughter went to bat for you here.
200,00:12:10,00:12:12,You better not be making her a liar.
201,00:12:16,00:12:18,(sighs)
202,00:12:32,00:12:36,You have good news for me; I can always tell.
203,00:12:36,00:12:38,"Well, at least someone still has faith in me."
204,00:12:38,00:12:39,"Oh, Lord."
205,00:12:39,00:12:40,Family?
206,00:12:40,00:12:42,"Yes. Um, never mind."
207,00:12:42,00:12:47,Good news item number one: the residue Morgan and Greg found in Silvana's dressing room...
208,00:12:47,00:12:49,Was motor oil. Mm-hmm.
209,00:12:49,00:12:55,"Which was also found on the burlap sack used to transport the body, along with flecks of dried blood matching our victim."
210,00:12:55,00:12:57,What else you got?
211,00:12:57,00:13:02,"Item number two: the chip found embedded in our victim's heel is not just one metal, but four."
212,00:13:02,00:13:04,"A metallic layer cake, if you will."
213,00:13:04,00:13:14,"""Trivalent chromium, nickel, copper, flat carbon steel."" Steel for the body, copper for the surface, nickel for the shine, and tri-chromium for the polish."
214,00:13:14,00:13:15,Auto body shop.
215,00:13:15,00:13:18,"Actually, it's a chrome-plating facility."
216,00:13:18,00:13:23,"There's only three in Vegas, one of which is only two blocks from the club."
217,00:13:23,00:13:26,Check out the name of the owner.
218,00:13:28,00:13:33,Eddie Santos-- face of the Cuban exiles.
219,00:13:33,00:13:35,Good work. I'll call Brass.
220,00:13:37,00:13:38,(tires screech)
221,00:13:43,00:13:45,Doesn't look like they're open for business.
222,00:13:45,00:13:47,"Well, it looks like somebody's home."
223,00:14:06,00:14:09,"Hey, Jim... (whispers): Yeah?"
224,00:14:09,00:14:12,STOKES: Metal chips look just like the trace Doc pulled out of the victim.
225,00:14:12,00:14:14,Yeah.
226,00:14:18,00:14:20,(whispers): Nick.
227,00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah?
228,00:14:21,00:14:24,BRASS: I got blood.
229,00:14:35,00:14:37,Looks like we found our primary.
230,00:14:39,00:14:41,(vehicle approaching)
231,00:14:41,00:14:43,(tires screech)
232,00:14:43,00:14:45,(turns off engine)
233,00:14:47,00:14:49,"BRASS: Eddie Santos, LVPD."
234,00:14:55,00:14:56,"You going somewhere, Eddie?"
235,00:15:01,00:15:05,"STOKES: We found all that stuff in your shop, Eddie, but it was matched to Marta Cuerto."
236,00:15:05,00:15:09,"BRASS: So let me guess, uh, you were headed back there to clean up when we arrested you, right?"
237,00:15:09,00:15:15,I had nothing to do with that or killing anyone-- I was going to my office to get paperwork. Paperwork?
238,00:15:15,00:15:16,Mm.
239,00:15:16,00:15:27,"Your last customer picked up his car at 11:30 yesterday morning, right before you closed up the shop at noon, right? And we know that Marta Cuerto was killed between 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m."
240,00:15:27,00:15:31,"and then delivered to her sister's dressing room, which is a block away from your shop."
241,00:15:31,00:15:32,Guilty until proven innocent!
242,00:15:32,00:15:34,I feel I'm back in Cuba!
243,00:15:34,00:15:36,Is that were you got those scars? In Cuba?
244,00:15:39,00:15:43,"30 years ago, I was in a room like this, with police like you."
245,00:15:43,00:15:46,They beat me and threw me in la gaveta.
246,00:15:46,00:15:48,La gaveta. They threw you in a drawer?
247,00:15:48,00:15:53,"Ten guys in a six-by-eight prison cell filled with rats, roaches, feces, (speaking Spanish)"
248,00:15:53,00:15:57,"Eddie, save the history lesson."
249,00:15:57,00:15:59,"This isn't Havana, Cuba."
250,00:15:59,00:16:06,"This is Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, and here we go on evidence, and we found a lot of it in your shop."
251,00:16:06,00:16:09,I have no reason to kill anyone.
252,00:16:09,00:16:17,"STOKES: We checked you out, Eddie-- the way you were following around Silvana, Marta, her manager-- everywhere they went, there you were. (speaks Spanish) It's a free country."
253,00:16:17,00:16:25,"BRASS: Right, where Silvana Cuerto can cash in. ""Bringing the Benjamins back to her repressive government."" Those are your words."
254,00:16:25,00:16:29,(speaking Spanish)
255,00:16:29,00:16:32,"Last I checked, I have the right to speak my mind."
256,00:16:32,00:16:34,"Yeah, but you don't have the right to commit murder..."
257,00:16:34,00:16:38,to exact revenge on traitors who aren't loyal to your cause.
258,00:16:38,00:16:43,And you damn sure don't have the right to torture people the way that you were tortured.
259,00:16:43,00:16:46,I didn't kill anyone!
260,00:16:46,00:16:48,"Oh, right-- you're one of those romantic revolutionaries."
261,00:16:48,00:16:50,We ran a rape kid on Marta.
262,00:16:50,00:16:51,We found semen.
263,00:16:51,00:16:56,We found contributions on a sofa in your shop!
264,00:16:56,00:17:02,"If you want us to compel your DNA and match it to the DNA we found, we're happy to do that."
265,00:17:02,00:17:04,You want evidence?
266,00:17:04,00:17:06,You don't need to compel anything.
267,00:17:06,00:17:09,"Go ahead, take my DNA."
268,00:17:17,00:17:18,(whirring)
269,00:17:40,00:17:43,RUSSELL: You sure DNA's not a match?
270,00:17:43,00:17:44,"I ran it twice, then called Greg."
271,00:17:44,00:17:48,Which is when I noticed that the result wasn't a total bust.
272,00:17:48,00:17:54,Eddie Santos's DNA profile showed a second-order relative match to the profile of our suspect.
273,00:17:54,00:17:56,"Second-order, as in a half sibling?"
274,00:17:56,00:17:58,"Or a grandson, maybe a nephew."
275,00:17:58,00:18:02,"ANDREWS: Either way, our suspect is definitely a member of Eddie Santos's family."
276,00:18:02,00:18:05,"Well, sounds like you need to shake the Santos family tree, right?"
277,00:18:05,00:18:08,"Or, you know, we could call our friend Donna Hoppe."
278,00:18:08,00:18:14,"Well, at this point, I may not be a genealogy Jedi, but Padewan, at least, I am."
279,00:18:15,00:18:16,I got this one.
280,00:18:19,00:18:21,"Hey, Doc. You said you had some news?"
281,00:18:21,00:18:25,An unexpected detour on the road to determining cause of death.
282,00:18:25,00:18:27,Take a look at these internal organs.
283,00:18:27,00:18:31,FINLAY: Wow. The heart and brain look really swollen.
284,00:18:31,00:18:32,30% more than normal.
285,00:18:32,00:18:36,Lungs are lined with this cherry red mucosa.
286,00:18:36,00:18:38,So Marta was poisoned.
287,00:18:38,00:18:40,What about the beating?
288,00:18:40,00:18:47,"While poisoning appears to be the ultimate C.O.D., vital response in the wounds suggests they were simultaneous events."
289,00:18:47,00:18:49,So the killer poisoned her and beat her.
290,00:18:49,00:18:53,You were talking about Cuban police torture.
291,00:18:53,00:18:55,Did you ever come across anything like this?
292,00:18:55,00:18:57,Never.
293,00:18:57,00:19:01,"FINLAY: And the cherry red color is indicative of cyanide, isn't it? Well, the short answer's yes."
294,00:19:01,00:19:04,I can't tell you how it would have gotten into her system.
295,00:19:04,00:19:09,"Didn't find any injection marks, no inhaled residue in her nasal passages."
296,00:19:09,00:19:11,What about her stomach contents?
297,00:19:11,00:19:13,Already sent that off to Hodges.
298,00:19:13,00:19:20,"Silvana's manager, Antonio, provided everybody in the band with prepaid cell phones; I pulled up every call that Marta made the day that she died."
299,00:19:20,00:19:26,"Made calls to her sister, Antonio, couple of calls to the Rumbason Club, also some fabric stores and fashion outlets."
300,00:19:26,00:19:28,"RUSSELL: Well, that makes sense."
301,00:19:28,00:19:31,Silvana said that Marta went shopping for wardrobe for the show.
302,00:19:31,00:19:33,Rehearsal wasn't until 8:00.
303,00:19:33,00:19:38,SIDLE: Here are the last calls she ever made-- three in a row right around 2:30 p.m.
304,00:19:38,00:19:40,Couple hours before she died.
305,00:19:40,00:19:42,No caller I.D.'s.
306,00:19:42,00:19:43,702 number's another prepaid cell.
307,00:19:43,00:19:45,RUSSELL: 202.
308,00:19:45,00:19:47,"Well, that's Washington, DC. Yeah."
309,00:19:47,00:19:49,Let's do a reverse directory search on that.
310,00:19:49,00:19:51,Read my mind.
311,00:19:51,00:19:54,(blipping)
312,00:19:54,00:19:55,SIDLE: Access denied.
313,00:19:55,00:19:58,"Put that together with Cuba and Washington, DC."
314,00:19:58,00:20:03,"The plot thickens. You know, I don't want to go to that CIA place, but..."
315,00:20:03,00:20:05,I'm kind of going to that CIA place.
316,00:20:10,00:20:13,(Sam whining)
317,00:20:14,00:20:16,Want a bite?
318,00:20:16,00:20:18,"Here you go, bud."
319,00:20:18,00:20:20,"Easy, easy."
320,00:20:20,00:20:21,Dog walker on vacation?
321,00:20:22,00:20:24,"Yeah, stomach flu."
322,00:20:24,00:20:28,"Huh. Speaking of, is that the report on Marta Cuerto's stomach contents?"
323,00:20:28,00:20:29,"This? Uh, no."
324,00:20:29,00:20:31,This is personal.
325,00:20:31,00:20:33,Okay. No problem.
326,00:20:33,00:20:38,"If you must know, uh, it's Morgan's character reference to Immigration in support of my engagement to Elisabetta."
327,00:20:38,00:20:45,"Wow. Well, you know, I would've been happy to write you a character reference-- I mean, I would've left out the part about your criminal record but..."
328,00:20:45,00:20:47,"Well, clearly, I should've talked to you first."
329,00:20:47,00:20:49,"Congratulations, buddy."
330,00:20:49,00:20:50,I look forward to meeting her sometime.
331,00:20:50,00:20:53,An oversight I plan to correct.
332,00:20:53,00:20:54,"Hear that, Sam?"
333,00:20:54,00:20:55,He's getting married. (barks)
334,00:20:55,00:20:56,(laughs)
335,00:20:56,00:20:58,"So, stomach contents."
336,00:20:58,00:21:00,"Yeah, in my office. All right."
337,00:21:00,00:21:02,"Sammy, I got some work to do now, boy."
338,00:21:02,00:21:05,"Stay here, I'll be right back."
339,00:21:05,00:21:11,"Based on my analysis of Marta Cuerto's stomach contents, I know how the cyanide got into her system."
340,00:21:11,00:21:15,"GCMS picked up linamarin, lotaustralin..."
341,00:21:15,00:21:18,cyanogenic glucosides.
342,00:21:18,00:21:20,"Well, how the hell did they get in there?"
343,00:21:20,00:21:23,Page two. Lovely illustration.
344,00:21:23,00:21:29,"Behold the cassava leaf, which has been known to produce medicinal properties, only if processed carefully."
345,00:21:29,00:21:30,And if not?
346,00:21:30,00:21:32,"Uh, nasty business."
347,00:21:32,00:21:42,"Especially in the hands of our killer, who, it seems, force-fed them to Marta, knowing that the glucosides from the unprocessed leaves would react with stomach enzymes to produce hydrogen cyanide."
348,00:21:42,00:21:45,Which is then absorbed through the stomach lining into the bloodstream.
349,00:21:45,00:21:50,"Once in the blood, cyanide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen, preventing the oxygen from getting to the cells."
350,00:21:50,00:21:53,The result-- asphyxiation.
351,00:21:53,00:21:54,Suffocation.
352,00:21:54,00:21:56,And death.
353,00:21:56,00:21:59,Heard our suspect's DNA shows he's related to Eddie Santos.
354,00:21:59,00:22:02,Russell said you were doing a little genealogy? Yeah.
355,00:22:02,00:22:05,And this family tree has some seriously poisoned roots back in Cuba.
356,00:22:05,00:22:09,I accessed the Clark County Museum of Hispanic Heritage database.
357,00:22:09,00:22:11,I found this.
358,00:22:11,00:22:17,BRODY: 1973 Cuban Army photo. Guy on the left-- Colonel Carlos Cuerto.
359,00:22:17,00:22:19,Cuerto? Related to the Cuerto sisters?
360,00:22:19,00:22:25,"Grandfather, and the guy next to him-- 25-year-old Sergeant Eduardo Santos."
361,00:22:25,00:22:26,Young Eddie Santos.
362,00:22:26,00:22:33,"A year after this, Eddie and two comrades made a crack about Colonel Cuerto's ties to the black market."
363,00:22:33,00:22:35,They were arrested and thrown in jail.
364,00:22:35,00:22:37,Where they were tortured.
365,00:22:37,00:22:40,For six years at the hands of Colonel Cuerto himself.
366,00:22:40,00:22:42,This may have nothing to do with politics at all.
367,00:22:42,00:22:45,It's a feud between the Cuerto and Santos family.
368,00:22:45,00:22:47,"Yeah, simmering for 40 years."
369,00:22:47,00:22:50,And I think I know which family member exacted revenge.
370,00:22:50,00:22:58,"Hilda Santos, sister of Eddie Santos, emigrated from Cuba in '92, married Oscar Mejia."
371,00:22:58,00:22:59,They had one son together.
372,00:23:01,00:23:03,"Estefan Mejia, owner of the Rumbason."
373,00:23:03,00:23:06,Also...
374,00:23:06,00:23:08,Eddie Santos' nephew.
375,00:23:10,00:23:12,(Silvana singing in Spanish)
376,00:23:26,00:23:27,What do you guys want?
377,00:23:27,00:23:31,"We just want to talk to you about your uncle, Eddie Santos."
378,00:23:31,00:23:34,MORGAN: And the vendetta your family has against the Cuertos family.
379,00:23:34,00:23:35,Vendetta? I have no part in any vendetta.
380,00:23:35,00:23:37,SANDERS: Really?
381,00:23:37,00:23:43,Then why don't you explain to us how we found your DNA on Marta Cuerto's body in your uncle's auto shop?
382,00:23:43,00:23:46,The DNA you left behind when you raped and killed her.
383,00:23:46,00:23:48,"(Silvana gasping, mic feedback whining)"
384,00:23:48,00:23:50,(muttering)
385,00:23:53,00:23:56,"Mitch, call an ambulance!"
386,00:24:03,00:24:05,"(distant, echoing singing in Spanish)"
387,00:24:05,00:24:08,(indistinct chatter)
388,00:24:11,00:24:16,"I'm going with her. Sir, I'm sorry. I can't let you in there right now. Get your hands off me. I demand to be inside with Silvana."
389,00:24:16,00:24:18,"Mitch, I've got this."
390,00:24:18,00:24:19,"Mr. Ficha, I'm so sorry."
391,00:24:19,00:24:22,Let me talk to you just for a second.
392,00:24:22,00:24:28,"Silvana's exhibiting the same signs of poisoning as Marta-- cyanide-- now, I've told the doctors, so they know what to do."
393,00:24:28,00:24:31,You saw the message scrawled in Silvana's dressing room.
394,00:24:31,00:24:33,Those animals said she was next.
395,00:24:33,00:24:35,Where were you?
396,00:24:35,00:24:37,"We do have a suspect in custody, sir."
397,00:24:37,00:24:39,"A little late, don't you think?"
398,00:24:42,00:24:44,Why won't you tell me what's happening with Silvana?
399,00:24:44,00:24:47,Why? You trying to figure out if you're on the hook for one murder or two?
400,00:24:47,00:24:49,What?!
401,00:24:49,00:24:50,"Your club is getting a bad rep, Estefan."
402,00:24:50,00:24:52,First Marta.
403,00:24:52,00:24:55,"Now your star attraction, Silvana, collapses on stage."
404,00:24:55,00:25:03,"STOKES: Yeah, at first we thought you just had lousy security, given the angry crowd outside, but now we know that the real threat was coming from inside."
405,00:25:03,00:25:05,Coming from you.
406,00:25:05,00:25:08,"I told you, I don't share the same beliefs as the exile community."
407,00:25:08,00:25:09,"Maybe not them, but what about your uncle?"
408,00:25:09,00:25:11,That's a different story.
409,00:25:11,00:25:12,"Blood is thicker than politics, right?"
410,00:25:12,00:25:14,I don't know what you're talking about.
411,00:25:14,00:25:16,STOKES: You know exactly what we're talking about.
412,00:25:16,00:25:19,Let me show you something.
413,00:25:19,00:25:28,"I think you referred to this as ""ancient history."" Let me show you a little recent history."
414,00:25:28,00:25:30,"I think you recognize that, don't you?"
415,00:25:30,00:25:33,Look familiar?
416,00:25:33,00:25:35,CRAWFORD: How'd it go down?
417,00:25:35,00:25:38,Did your uncle watch while you raped her?
418,00:25:38,00:25:43,"And then, you two guys, what, you tied her up, then you beat her."
419,00:25:43,00:25:48,STOKES: And then forced cassava leaves down her throat and watched her suffocate.
420,00:25:48,00:25:49,No.
421,00:25:49,00:25:51,"DNA doesn't lie, man! We know it was you!"
422,00:25:51,00:25:53,I didn't. I couldn't hurt her.
423,00:25:53,00:25:55,So? It was your uncle then.
424,00:25:55,00:25:57,"No! I mean, I don't know."
425,00:25:57,00:26:00,"You don't know? No, I wasn't there..."
426,00:26:00,00:26:01,when this happened.
427,00:26:01,00:26:06,"Look, my uncle tried to turn me against the Cuertos, but Silvana, Marta and I were friends."
428,00:26:06,00:26:08,I lived with them when I was a kid.
429,00:26:08,00:26:10,"Even when I came to this country, we stayed in touch."
430,00:26:10,00:26:14,"When Silvana's career took off, I saw it as a chance to bring them here."
431,00:26:14,00:26:21,"STOKES: No, you saw it as an opportunity to lure the Cuerto sisters and settle an old score."
432,00:26:21,00:26:23,My uncle's fight is not my fight!
433,00:26:23,00:26:25,I couldn't hurt her!
434,00:26:25,00:26:26,I couldn't hurt Marta!
435,00:26:26,00:26:28,Her and I were in love.
436,00:26:28,00:26:31,Is that why you took her to your uncle's body shop?
437,00:26:31,00:26:33,That's not my idea of romance.
438,00:26:33,00:26:37,It was the only place near the Rumbason where we could meet... in secret.
439,00:26:38,00:26:42,"Marta called me, and I went to her."
440,00:26:42,00:26:43,(moaning) We made love.
441,00:26:43,00:26:46,I got to go. I'll see you tonight.
442,00:26:48,00:26:50,Marta was still alive when I left.
443,00:26:50,00:26:52,I swear.
444,00:26:52,00:26:53,What about your uncle? Where was he at?
445,00:26:55,00:26:57,I can't tell you.
446,00:26:59,00:27:02,You can't... or you won't?
447,00:27:04,00:27:06,"HODGES: Si, si, si."
448,00:27:06,00:27:08,Sono contento.
449,00:27:08,00:27:10,"No, Elisabetta, I'm-I'm very happy."
450,00:27:10,00:27:13,It-It's just that it's-it's hard.
451,00:27:13,00:27:18,"Um... difficile, uh, for me to express it... in Italian."
452,00:27:18,00:27:20,"It's, uh... it's the language barrier and..."
453,00:27:20,00:27:22,Elisabetta. Hello?
454,00:27:22,00:27:24,Hello?
455,00:27:24,00:27:25,(sighs)
456,00:27:25,00:27:28,(phone beeps off) Sorry to interrupt.
457,00:27:28,00:27:30,Hi. (laughs)
458,00:27:30,00:27:34,I brought you Silvana Cuerto's stomach contents for analysis.
459,00:27:34,00:27:36,"Aw, you shouldn't have. (laughs)"
460,00:27:38,00:27:41,"So, everything okay with Elisabetta?"
461,00:27:41,00:27:42,"Yeah, uh, great."
462,00:27:42,00:27:45,"Yeah, in-in fact, uh, she just heard from Immigration."
463,00:27:45,00:27:51,"Uh, they processed our application, and, uh, because of your help, uh, we've been approved."
464,00:27:51,00:27:53,Wow. (laughs)
465,00:27:53,00:27:56,"Yeah. So, what... what does that mean?"
466,00:27:56,00:28:02,"Well, uh, it means that we have 90 days to get married, or she gets put back on a plane home."
467,00:28:02,00:28:05,"Well, it's a good thing you live in Vegas."
468,00:28:05,00:28:07,You can just get hitched at a drive-thru.
469,00:28:07,00:28:09,(laughs)
470,00:28:09,00:28:11,"Well, don't take your foot off the gas."
471,00:28:11,00:28:13,(laughs) Thanks.
472,00:28:25,00:28:27,Look who's back.
473,00:28:27,00:28:30,"CSI... Russell, right?"
474,00:28:30,00:28:31,"Yeah, that's right."
475,00:28:31,00:28:33,How are you feeling?
476,00:28:33,00:28:35,I don't know.
477,00:28:35,00:28:37,What happened?
478,00:28:37,00:28:39,"Well, we're gonna find that out."
479,00:28:39,00:28:42,Seems somebody tried to poison you.
480,00:28:42,00:28:44,Like they did to Marta?
481,00:28:45,00:28:47,Antonio told me.
482,00:28:47,00:28:53,"Well, the person who poisoned your sister forced her to ingest cassava leaves."
483,00:28:53,00:29:02,"Now, clearly, that was not the case with you, but do you remember if anyone offered you any food, or something to drink before your rehearsal?"
484,00:29:02,00:29:03,No.
485,00:29:03,00:29:05,But I-I can't remember much.
486,00:29:05,00:29:07,Okay.
487,00:29:07,00:29:11,"What I do remember, I wish I could forget."
488,00:29:11,00:29:16,I was so happy to come here.
489,00:29:16,00:29:18,To be a star...
490,00:29:18,00:29:20,in this country.
491,00:29:22,00:29:24,"Now, Marta..."
492,00:29:24,00:29:26,Marta's dead.
493,00:29:28,00:29:30,(voice breaking): I should never have...
494,00:29:33,00:29:36,Please...
495,00:29:36,00:29:38,find who did this.
496,00:29:41,00:29:43,Please tell me that you have something.
497,00:29:43,00:29:46,You know we had to let Eddie Santos go.
498,00:29:46,00:29:48,"Well, we just sprung his nephew Estefan, as well."
499,00:29:48,00:29:53,So I am hoping that we can tie at least one of them to Silvana's poisoning.
500,00:29:53,00:29:55,"Well, I can tell you this much."
501,00:29:55,00:29:59,Silvana Cuerto was poisoned with cyanide by way of unprocessed cassava leaves.
502,00:29:59,00:30:01,So at least our killer is consistent.
503,00:30:01,00:30:04,"Not entirely, because in Silvana's case, he changed the method of delivery."
504,00:30:04,00:30:09,"In addition to the cassava leaves, I found gelatin and plant polysaccharides."
505,00:30:09,00:30:11,Which is from soluble capsules?
506,00:30:11,00:30:13,Yes.
507,00:30:13,00:30:16,"So, Silvana ingested pills filled with poison."
508,00:30:16,00:30:19,"Yes, again, but I don't think she knew that they were filled with poison."
509,00:30:19,00:30:25,"I suspect that she thought they were filled with justicia pectoralis, which I also found in the mix."
510,00:30:25,00:30:27,"It's an herbal remedy, primarily used for relaxation."
511,00:30:27,00:30:29,Cubans call it tilo.
512,00:30:29,00:30:31,Tilo. You know it?
513,00:30:31,00:30:33,"Yeah, I just saw it on the evidence list."
514,00:30:33,00:30:37,Greg found a bottle of it in Silvana's dressing room.
515,00:30:37,00:30:43,"Maybe somebody who had access-- perhaps Estefan-- spiked Silvana's calm pills, tried to kill her buzz."
516,00:30:43,00:30:45,I'll get Greg to run the tilo.
517,00:30:45,00:30:48,Thank you. Pleasure.
518,00:31:13,00:31:16,"(trilling, beeping)"
519,00:31:42,00:31:48,"RUSSELL: So, Hodges confirmed that the tilo capsules we found in Silvana's dressing room contained ground-up cassava leaves."
520,00:31:48,00:31:50,Source of the cyanide.
521,00:31:50,00:31:55,"Right. Lucky for Silvana, that when you put the poison in a capsule, it reduces the-the potency. All right."
522,00:31:55,00:31:58,And we know the print Greg assembled came back to Antonio Ficha.
523,00:31:58,00:32:00,So much for him being her handler.
524,00:32:00,00:32:03,"Looks like he's our killer, but I-I don't... I don't get it."
525,00:32:03,00:32:05,"Well, I may have something for you."
526,00:32:05,00:32:10,Just got off the phone with the State Department-- Cuerto sisters were seeking asylum.
527,00:32:10,00:32:14,That explains the phone call to... to DC.
528,00:32:14,00:32:16,"Sisters defecting, bad news for Antonio. All right."
529,00:32:16,00:32:18,So what are we thinking? That he killed Marta and then...
530,00:32:18,00:32:21,"left the warning for Silvana, ""You're next""?"
531,00:32:21,00:32:22,"Obviously, she didn't get the message."
532,00:32:22,00:32:25,Right. I'm on my way.
533,00:32:25,00:32:29,"You got something? Yeah, Antonio Ficha checked Silvana out of the hospital about a half hour ago."
534,00:32:29,00:32:31,Where were they going?
535,00:32:31,00:32:33,Patrol spotted them returning to their hotel.
536,00:32:33,00:32:34,(phone ringing) I'm meeting Brass over at the Palermo.
537,00:32:34,00:32:36,"Crawford. Okay, I'm on my way."
538,00:32:36,00:32:40,CRAWFORD: Guy at the front desk says Antonio and Silvana arrived about 20 minutes ago.
539,00:32:40,00:32:41,Went straight up to the room.
540,00:32:41,00:32:42,Were they alone? They were.
541,00:32:42,00:32:44,"What do you mean ""they were""?"
542,00:32:44,00:32:45,"A few minutes after that, another guy showed up."
543,00:32:45,00:32:48,His description matches Estefan Mejia.
544,00:32:48,00:32:49,"What the hell is he doing here? (shouting, clattering)"
545,00:32:49,00:32:52,Uh-oh... MAN: No! (gunshot)
546,00:32:52,00:32:53,BRASS: LVPD!
547,00:32:53,00:32:55,"Drop the gun! Drop the gun, Antonio!"
548,00:32:55,00:32:56,CRAWFORD: Drop the gun!
549,00:32:56,00:32:58,Show me your hands!
550,00:32:58,00:33:00,Against the wall! Come on!
551,00:33:02,00:33:04,It's Estefan. He's dead.
552,00:33:04,00:33:06,Silvana?
553,00:33:06,00:33:08,(woman crying)
554,00:33:09,00:33:11,It's okay.
555,00:33:11,00:33:13,Everything's okay. Antonio's crazy.
556,00:33:13,00:33:16,He was going to kill me. It's all right. It's all right.
557,00:33:16,00:33:18,You're safe now. You're safe.
558,00:33:18,00:33:19,It's all over.
559,00:33:24,00:33:27,"All right, what do you got for me, David?"
560,00:33:27,00:33:29,"Broken nose, bruises."
561,00:33:29,00:33:34,Took a few shots to the face before a single GSW to the forehead.
562,00:33:34,00:33:36,And there's no exit wound.
563,00:33:36,00:33:40,"It's a large caliber, consistent with a .45."
564,00:33:40,00:33:41,Check this out.
565,00:33:44,00:33:47,(groans) It's a compound fracture of the right index finger.
566,00:33:47,00:33:48,That's the trigger finger.
567,00:33:48,00:33:51,Antonio must've wrenched the gun out of his hand.
568,00:33:56,00:33:58,"Hey, Morgan..."
569,00:33:59,00:34:00,...take a look at this.
570,00:34:05,00:34:07,Seen that before.
571,00:34:07,00:34:08,In Silvana's dressing room.
572,00:34:08,00:34:13,Yeah. Killer used the burlap sack to transport Marta's body with.
573,00:34:13,00:34:15,But what's it doing here?
574,00:34:15,00:34:16,"(ventilation whirrs, whooshes)"
575,00:34:26,00:34:28,"Hey, guys, look what I found."
576,00:34:31,00:34:32,BRODY: Antonio's bag.
577,00:34:32,00:34:34,Yeah.
578,00:34:34,00:34:35,With blood on it.
579,00:34:41,00:34:44,It's like a regular murder kit.
580,00:34:44,00:34:46,What do we have here?
581,00:34:49,00:34:52,I'm guessing those are cassava leaves.
582,00:34:52,00:34:53,It happened so fast.
583,00:34:53,00:34:55,Estefan pushed his way into the room.
584,00:34:55,00:34:56,Then he and Antonio started to argue.
585,00:34:56,00:34:58,What were they arguing about?
586,00:34:58,00:35:04,"He said Antonio had murdered Marta, tried to poison me and that he wouldn't let Antonio hurt me again."
587,00:35:04,00:35:08,What made Estefan think that Antonio was the one behind it all?
588,00:35:08,00:35:09,He said his uncle told him.
589,00:35:09,00:35:13,"When Estefan pulled out a gun, I ran into the bathroom to hide."
590,00:35:13,00:35:16,Then I heard a shot.
591,00:35:16,00:35:18,And I was sure he'd killed Antonio.
592,00:35:18,00:35:23,"Then the police arrived, and I saw Estefan lying on the floor."
593,00:35:23,00:35:26,He was just trying to protect me.
594,00:35:26,00:35:28,You're gonna be all right.
595,00:35:28,00:35:30,"I think we should get you to the hospital, just to make sure."
596,00:35:30,00:35:31,"No, I don't want to go to the hospital."
597,00:35:33,00:35:36,I just want to go home.
598,00:35:36,00:35:37,Silvana's returning to Cuba.
599,00:35:37,00:35:38,And so am I.
600,00:35:38,00:35:40,You have no right to hold me here.
601,00:35:40,00:35:41,I've done nothing wrong.
602,00:35:41,00:35:46,"Antonio, we walked in on you standing over Estefan Mejia with a gun in your hand."
603,00:35:46,00:35:47,"Yeah, man, I think the gun was still smoking."
604,00:35:47,00:35:49,That was in self-defense.
605,00:35:49,00:35:50,Mm.
606,00:35:50,00:35:52,Silvana and I were packing our bags when...
607,00:35:52,00:35:54,Estefan showed up.
608,00:35:54,00:35:56,"I tried to reason with him, but his head was filled with..."
609,00:35:56,00:35:58,lies.
610,00:35:58,00:36:00,"You son of a bitch! I know what you've done! Oye, tranquilo!"
611,00:36:00,00:36:01,Tranquilo! Cálmate!
612,00:36:01,00:36:03,You killed Marta! You poisoned Silvana!
613,00:36:03,00:36:05,What are you talking about?! That was your crazy uncle.
614,00:36:05,00:36:08,"Not me! I am the one protecting Silvana, and I'm taking her home."
615,00:36:08,00:36:09,"No, you're not going anywhere!"
616,00:36:09,00:36:10,"No, no, no! Ooh!"
617,00:36:10,00:36:12,(speaks Spanish)
618,00:36:12,00:36:15,(grunting)
619,00:36:15,00:36:18,"(shouts, grunts)"
620,00:36:19,00:36:22,Now you get the hell out of here.
621,00:36:22,00:36:22,No!
622,00:36:25,00:36:27,Estefan gave me no choice.
623,00:36:27,00:36:29,STOKES: Let's say I buy self-defense.
624,00:36:29,00:36:34,We still found your fingerprints on Silvana's tilo capsules.
625,00:36:34,00:36:36,They were filled with cyanide.
626,00:36:37,00:36:40,So you think I poisoned Silvana?
627,00:36:40,00:36:43,Why would I do such a thing?
628,00:36:43,00:36:45,She's Cuba's gift to the world.
629,00:36:45,00:36:46,"Gift to the U.S., you mean."
630,00:36:46,00:36:49,She and Marta wanted to defect.
631,00:36:49,00:36:51,But you weren't gonna let that happen.
632,00:36:53,00:36:55,(over speaker): I don't know what you're talking about.
633,00:36:55,00:36:56,He's lying.
634,00:36:56,00:36:58,Maybe.
635,00:36:58,00:37:01,(over speaker): And I don't know anything about any poisoned pills.
636,00:37:01,00:37:03,I gave Silvana my tilo to calm her down after Marta's death.
637,00:37:03,00:37:05,I guess you don't know anything about this bag.
638,00:37:05,00:37:07,Same one with your name on it.
639,00:37:07,00:37:09,CRAWFORD: It also has Marta's blood on it.
640,00:37:09,00:37:20,And that's the same kind of rope you used to tie her up with. STOKES: And the fiber is a match to the same burlap sack used to transport her to the Rumbason from Eddie Santos's auto body shop.
641,00:37:20,00:37:23,CRAWFORD: You've been trying to frame Eddie Santos from day one.
642,00:37:23,00:37:25,No. I am the one being framed here.
643,00:37:25,00:37:26,Don't you see?
644,00:37:29,00:37:32,I thought justice in your country wasn't about what you believe.
645,00:37:32,00:37:34,It's about what you can prove.
646,00:37:34,00:37:36,No?
647,00:37:36,00:37:38,What can we prove?
648,00:37:38,00:37:40,We're running everything right now.
649,00:37:40,00:37:41,State Department's all over this.
650,00:37:41,00:37:42,We can't afford any mistakes.
651,00:37:44,00:37:45,"Well, neither can he."
652,00:37:49,00:37:50,"HODGES: Hey, boss."
653,00:37:50,00:37:52,I've got confirmation of our preliminary results.
654,00:37:52,00:37:56,Blood on Antonio Ficha's duffel bag matches Marta Cuerto.
655,00:37:56,00:38:04,That's good. And the fibers that we found from the burlap sack match the burlap sack that the killer used to move the body. Also good.
656,00:38:04,00:38:08,"The rope, the cassava leaves are all consistent. But?"
657,00:38:08,00:38:12,But Henry couldn't recover any DNA from the gloves.
658,00:38:12,00:38:15,And I found this little mystery in the duffel.
659,00:38:15,00:38:17,What's this?
660,00:38:17,00:38:18,Mouton.
661,00:38:18,00:38:25,Lambskin. With a particular acrylic dye recipe commonly used in the restoration of classic American cars.
662,00:38:25,00:38:27,Which you're thinking the killer used to transport the body.
663,00:38:27,00:38:33,"HODGES: Yes. And according to the fiber, we should be looking in the trunk of a 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air."
664,00:38:33,00:38:36,"Oh. Now, that's the same car that Eddie Santos drives."
665,00:38:36,00:38:38,"I went there, too. There's just one problem."
666,00:38:38,00:38:44,"I processed Eddie's Chevy while he was in custody, and his car hasn't seen a carpet upgrade since 1956."
667,00:38:44,00:38:46,"Oh. Well, that's not good."
668,00:38:46,00:38:49,"HODGES: Of course, Eddie has a stable of classic cars."
669,00:38:49,00:38:49,Could be one of them.
670,00:38:54,00:38:59,"Or the car, like our killer, could've been staring us in the face the whole time."
671,00:38:59,00:39:02,I checked with Sunstar Auto Rental.
672,00:39:02,00:39:10,They said they wrote a two-day contract on this '56 Chevy for Antonio for-for your photo shoot.
673,00:39:10,00:39:18,"But the kid behind the desk said that he was such a big fan, that when you came back to rent it for an extra day, he gave it to you for free."
674,00:39:18,00:39:19,Off the books.
675,00:39:19,00:39:21,I guess...
676,00:39:21,00:39:28,"like me, he was won over by your-your beautiful voice, your warm heart, your... trusting face."
677,00:39:28,00:39:30,Anyway...
678,00:39:30,00:39:32,he said something else that was very interesting.
679,00:39:32,00:39:37,He said that he wasn't used to having people return vehicles cleaner than when they drove them off the lot.
680,00:39:39,00:39:41,Silvana...
681,00:39:41,00:39:44,I know you did it.
682,00:39:44,00:39:45,I know you killed your sister.
683,00:39:45,00:39:48,I loved my sister. I don't doubt that.
684,00:39:48,00:39:54,"Because, in my experience, a brutal murder like Marta's can only come from deep emotions."
685,00:39:54,00:39:57,Love turned to hate through betrayal.
686,00:39:57,00:39:59,You don't even know what you're talking about.
687,00:39:59,00:40:01,"Actually, I do."
688,00:40:01,00:40:03,Let me back up a second.
689,00:40:03,00:40:09,"Estefan brought you and your sister here, but it was Marta who contacted the State Department."
690,00:40:09,00:40:13,So that you could have a career in this country.
691,00:40:13,00:40:17,"But more importantly, so she could be near Estefan."
692,00:40:17,00:40:20,"But you wanted Estefan for yourself, didn't you?"
693,00:40:20,00:40:23,You loved him. Ever since you were kids.
694,00:40:23,00:40:26,"And the more you loved him, the more you hated your sister."
695,00:40:26,00:40:29,You're forgetting I'm the victim of Antonio's betrayal.
696,00:40:29,00:40:30,"Well, it does look like that."
697,00:40:30,00:40:32,Because you made it look like that.
698,00:40:32,00:40:35,"Antonio's bag, incriminating."
699,00:40:35,00:40:41,"Antonio's tilo pills, poisoned just enough to make you sick but not enough to kill you. These are lies."
700,00:40:41,00:40:43,These are all lies!
701,00:40:43,00:40:47,"Why can't you see the truth? You know, actually, I-I heard the truth, Silvana."
702,00:40:47,00:40:53,"Because you've already given us your confession, haven't you?"
703,00:40:53,00:40:55,(Silvana's melancholy love ballad plays)
704,00:41:00,00:41:04,"All this time, listening to these lyrics but not really hearing them."
705,00:41:04,00:41:11,"These words of-of love, loss, revenge..."
706,00:41:11,00:41:12,redemption.
707,00:41:15,00:41:20,"No matter what she's done, she still believes that her lover will forgive her."
708,00:41:20,00:41:22,Come to rescue her.
709,00:41:22,00:41:27,"Just like you believed when you called Estefan, and begged him to come to the hotel to rescue you."
710,00:41:27,00:41:29,But Antonio was trying to kill me.
711,00:41:29,00:41:34,"No, you murdered your sister, and you told Estefan that Antonio did it."
712,00:41:34,00:41:38,"You do realize, don't you, that your lies got Estefan killed?"
713,00:41:40,00:41:43,Marta knew how much I loved Estefan.
714,00:41:44,00:41:46,Since we were children.
715,00:41:46,00:41:49,Every song I wrote was about him.
716,00:41:49,00:41:52,She should have never come between us!
717,00:41:52,00:41:55,Forced me to punish her for what she took from me.
718,00:41:55,00:41:59,I beat her. I killed her!
719,00:41:59,00:42:02,And I would do it again if that would bring Estefan back!
720,00:42:04,00:42:08,You tried to tell me that you should never have come to this country.
721,00:42:10,00:42:12,You're right.
722,00:42:12,00:42:18,"Unlike your song, Silvana, you'll find no redemption here."
