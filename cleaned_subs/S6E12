1,00:00:23,00:00:26,(music ends)
2,00:00:43,00:00:46,(moans quietly)
3,00:00:46,00:00:47,"Hey, lady."
4,00:00:47,00:00:49,Hey.
5,00:00:49,00:00:53,I can't sleep.
6,00:00:53,00:00:55,You want to try to eat something?
7,00:00:55,00:00:57,Yeah.
8,00:01:02,00:01:03,All right.
9,00:01:03,00:01:05,I'll go get him.
10,00:01:05,00:01:06,You get dressed.
11,00:01:08,00:01:10,Ahren?
12,00:01:13,00:01:14,Ahren?
13,00:01:17,00:01:18,Ahren?
14,00:01:22,00:01:23,Ahren...
15,00:01:23,00:01:24,(gasps)
16,00:01:26,00:01:28,(whispering): Ahren...
17,00:01:30,00:01:32,Ahren...
18,00:01:33,00:01:39,"BRASS: Okay, Ahren Green, 29 years old, lives here with Bianca Desmond, that's the brunette."
19,00:01:40,00:01:42,The blonde is Chelsea Wannamaker.
20,00:01:42,00:01:44,She was just spending the night.
21,00:01:44,00:01:46,"One was asleep, one was in the bathroom."
22,00:01:46,00:01:48,They said Ahren was probably working on his bike.
23,00:01:48,00:01:51,(camera shutter clicking)
24,00:01:51,00:01:52,PHILLIPS: His pupils are dilated.
25,00:01:52,00:01:54,Lividity is consistent with body position.
26,00:01:54,00:01:59,Looks like he bled out from a stab wound to his upper leg or pelvic area.
27,00:01:59,00:02:03,"Well, in my experience, I found that most threesomes end up being one too many."
28,00:02:03,00:02:06,"So, David, uh..."
29,00:02:06,00:02:09,check and make sure that they didn't pull a Lorena Bobbitt.
30,00:02:10,00:02:11,Take a look.
31,00:02:19,00:02:20,"No, we're good."
32,00:02:20,00:02:21,My man's all there.
33,00:02:21,00:02:23,We're...good.
34,00:02:23,00:02:24,Something must be wrong his gear.
35,00:02:24,00:02:29,"He could be partying with two hot chicks inside, but he's out here working on his bike at 4:00 in the morning?"
36,00:02:29,00:02:31,Maybe he wasn't invited.
37,00:03:06,00:03:09,"SIDLE: Hold out your hands, please."
38,00:03:10,00:03:13,And the other side.
39,00:03:17,00:03:20,What were you doing right before Ahren was killed?
40,00:03:20,00:03:23,Cleaning.
41,00:03:23,00:03:24,With what?
42,00:03:24,00:03:26,Bleach.
43,00:03:26,00:03:28,It's the only thing that works.
44,00:03:28,00:03:29,Okay.
45,00:03:29,00:03:32,"You know, you could put some clothes on if you want, if you're cold."
46,00:03:32,00:03:34,She won't let me back in my room.
47,00:03:35,00:03:37,(camera clicking)
48,00:04:08,00:04:10,"Man, I give this guy an ""A"" for organization."
49,00:04:10,00:04:13,He's got a spot for everything.
50,00:04:13,00:04:14,Why is that helmet over there?
51,00:04:15,00:04:18,"GRISSOM: Maybe he threw it, defending himself."
52,00:04:24,00:04:26,(screaming)
53,00:04:26,00:04:28,"Yeah, but he looked like he was in pretty good shape."
54,00:04:28,00:04:31,It'd be kind of hard for one of those women to wrestle him down.
55,00:04:31,00:04:34,Not if she walks softly and carried a big knife.
56,00:04:34,00:04:36,How long have you known Ahren?
57,00:04:36,00:04:38,Six months.
58,00:04:39,00:04:42,"Did, uh, did he have any enemies that you know of?"
59,00:04:42,00:04:46,"No, I mean... I don't know."
60,00:04:46,00:04:47,You don't know...
61,00:04:47,00:04:48,"I mean, you two lived together right?"
62,00:04:48,00:04:51,"Yeah, but we were still getting to know each other."
63,00:04:52,00:04:52,I see.
64,00:04:53,00:04:54,We met one night at Light.
65,00:04:54,00:04:58,He was in town for a motocross race.
66,00:04:58,00:05:00,It was love at first sight.
67,00:05:00,00:05:06,"I asked him to come back here, and he never left."
68,00:05:06,00:05:11,We actually just decided tonight to move to Colorado together.
69,00:05:11,00:05:12,"What, just pick up and leave all this?"
70,00:05:12,00:05:16,My father has a cabin where we could stay.
71,00:05:16,00:05:17,Did Ahren have a job?
72,00:05:17,00:05:19,Yeah. Motocross racing. Right.
73,00:05:20,00:05:21,You said that.
74,00:05:21,00:05:22,He's a professional athlete.
75,00:05:22,00:05:24,"And you, what about you? What do you do?"
76,00:05:24,00:05:25,I'm in fashion.
77,00:05:25,00:05:27,Mm-hm.
78,00:05:29,00:05:30,What's the matter?
79,00:05:33,00:05:35,I have the worst luck with men.
80,00:05:35,00:05:38,What do you mean?
81,00:05:38,00:05:44,"They're either jerks or they leave me, or they get killed."
82,00:05:47,00:05:49,What's wrong with me?
83,00:05:53,00:05:55,What do you got?
84,00:05:55,00:05:59,"Well, I wasn't sure if I should call it in as a 419 or a 401A."
85,00:05:59,00:06:01,Hit and run?
86,00:06:01,00:06:03,You tell me.
87,00:06:03,00:06:06,"STOKES: Mm, I don't know."
88,00:06:06,00:06:08,"When you run, you usually take the car."
89,00:06:09,00:06:10,The vic's Sylvia Mullins.
90,00:06:10,00:06:12,Works in one of the offices upstairs.
91,00:06:12,00:06:15,The security guard found her.
92,00:06:15,00:06:17,Did you run the plates?
93,00:06:17,00:06:18,That's why I went with the 419.
94,00:06:19,00:06:20,R.O.'s the vic.
95,00:06:27,00:06:31,Hit with her own car in her own spot.
96,00:06:31,00:06:34,Ms. Mullins must have been working all night.
97,00:06:34,00:06:35,"You know, tax season."
98,00:06:35,00:06:36,She's an accountant?
99,00:06:36,00:06:39,Has her own firm up on 11.
100,00:06:40,00:06:43,Did you see anything on your monitors?
101,00:06:45,00:06:47,"Uh, no."
102,00:06:47,00:06:48,But I heard the crash.
103,00:06:48,00:06:50,I sort of fell asleep.
104,00:06:50,00:06:53,We're going to need to see your tapes.
105,00:06:53,00:06:58,"WILLOWS: Cell phone, a shoe and a briefcase."
106,00:06:58,00:07:00,Probably lost them all on impact.
107,00:07:00,00:07:02,STOKES: Looks like she saw the car coming.
108,00:07:02,00:07:05,Impact's pretty evenly distributed.
109,00:07:05,00:07:07,The car hit her straight on.
110,00:07:07,00:07:11,Most cars have to be going at least 14 miles an hour to trigger the airbag.
111,00:07:15,00:07:19,"Well, I can't be sure, but it looks like somebody popped the ignition."
112,00:07:21,00:07:22,Carjacking gone bad?
113,00:07:25,00:07:28,"Vic gets off the elevator, walks to her spot..."
114,00:07:30,00:07:34,"...on the phone, distracted, catches the guy stealing her ride..."
115,00:07:47,00:07:50,He runs her over and splits.
116,00:07:50,00:07:52,Pedal to the metal.
117,00:07:59,00:08:01,Hey.
118,00:08:01,00:08:03,ALS is lighting up everywhere.
119,00:08:03,00:08:05,Evidently she bleaches everything.
120,00:08:05,00:08:07,So there could be some false positives.
121,00:08:07,00:08:11,"Yeah, including her teeth."
122,00:08:11,00:08:12,Check out the cabinet.
123,00:08:15,00:08:19,SIDLE: Lots of teeth whitener and acne cream.
124,00:08:19,00:08:21,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
125,00:08:21,00:08:22,Speed freak.
126,00:08:22,00:08:23,Definitely.
127,00:08:24,00:08:29,Maybe she killed Ahren in the garage then came up here to take a Silkwood shower.
128,00:08:35,00:08:41,"Okay, but she's claiming she loved him."
129,00:08:41,00:08:42,What's her motive?
130,00:08:42,00:08:56,"Uh, we started out at Light and then we went to Road Runner, and from there we were at Double Down, and then Copper K, and then we ended up at Drai's."
131,00:08:56,00:08:58,"Drai's, that's a good place to end."
132,00:08:58,00:09:00,So what are you on besides meth?
133,00:09:02,00:09:04,Not meth.
134,00:09:04,00:09:05,Glass.
135,00:09:05,00:09:07,Uh-huh.
136,00:09:08,00:09:11,"We did some coke at the club, had a couple of drinks."
137,00:09:11,00:09:17,"There was this guy that gave us these, uh, these blue pills, but I had to come home and lie down."
138,00:09:17,00:09:18,Ecstasy.
139,00:09:18,00:09:20,"We only do this when we're, when we're clubbing."
140,00:09:20,00:09:24,"I mean, it's just a hobby, it's not a habit."
141,00:09:24,00:09:26,We have it under control.
142,00:09:26,00:09:30,"Well, the dead guy from the garage might beg to differ."
143,00:09:35,00:09:37,"Eww, busy."
144,00:09:37,00:09:44,"If Bianca killed him, and then came up here to take a shower, wouldn't she have left a trail?"
145,00:09:44,00:09:46,Maybe.
146,00:10:05,00:10:07,It appears she missed a spot.
147,00:10:39,00:10:42,(gunshot)
148,00:10:45,00:10:48,(soft rattling)
149,00:11:00,00:11:02,(phone ringing)
150,00:11:08,00:11:10,Las Vegas Coroner's Office.
151,00:11:10,00:11:11,"David, it's Warrick. Have you washed the body yet?"
152,00:11:11,00:11:14,"I just got started, but I can be done by the time you get here."
153,00:11:14,00:11:15,"No, stop."
154,00:11:15,00:11:18,"I uh, just found a bullet."
155,00:11:18,00:11:19,I have no idea who fired it.
156,00:11:19,00:11:25,Do me a favor: test his hands for GSR and run it through the flouroscope.
157,00:11:25,00:11:26,No problem.
158,00:11:26,00:11:29,"Thanks, David."
159,00:11:29,00:11:32,Who brings a gun to a knife fight?
160,00:11:34,00:11:36,The winner?
161,00:11:38,00:11:39,The killer knew how to steal a car.
162,00:11:39,00:11:40,No prints? No.
163,00:11:40,00:11:43,"No, it's wiped clean."
164,00:11:43,00:11:44,"Hey, Arch."
165,00:11:44,00:11:46,You get anything off the parking garage camera?
166,00:11:47,00:11:49,"Um, sort of."
167,00:11:52,00:11:53,STOKES: What's up with the focus?
168,00:11:53,00:11:54,"That's what I was wondering, too."
169,00:11:55,00:11:58,Check out what happened about an hour earlier.
170,00:12:01,00:12:03,It's an old security cam.
171,00:12:03,00:12:04,Adjustable focus ring.
172,00:12:04,00:12:06,Killer was camera shy.
173,00:12:06,00:12:07,For good reason.
174,00:12:07,00:12:09,This wasn't a carjacking gone bad.
175,00:12:09,00:12:10,It was premeditated.
176,00:12:10,00:12:14,"If he touched the camera, maybe I can get some prints off it."
177,00:12:14,00:12:15,"Keep working the video, Arch."
178,00:12:15,00:12:17,See if you can get us a face. Yeah.
179,00:12:17,00:12:20,ROBBINS: Fluoroscope detected no bullets.
180,00:12:20,00:12:25,"But there are peri-mortem bruises on his wrists and forearms, look like defensive wounds."
181,00:12:25,00:12:26,C.O.D.?
182,00:12:26,00:12:29,The weapon went pretty deep. Punctured the femoral artery.
183,00:12:29,00:12:35,"I'd say he bled out in a matter of minutes, if his dilated pupils are an indication of amphetamines in his system."
184,00:12:36,00:12:37,"The faster the heart rate, the faster the blood pumps."
185,00:12:38,00:12:39,"Here, take a look."
186,00:12:40,00:12:42,The fatal blow.
187,00:12:42,00:12:45,Weapon appears to have a triangular shape.
188,00:12:45,00:12:47,Angle of entry was upwards.
189,00:12:47,00:12:50,Like a cornada. I'm sorry.
190,00:12:50,00:12:54,A cornada-- occupational hazard for matadors during a bullfight.
191,00:12:55,00:12:56,The bull rears up and gores them.
192,00:12:56,00:13:00,"So just find a bull with a bloody horn, and you've got your killer."
193,00:13:02,00:13:06,"So your ""soda-can killer"" was a copper-washed .22."
194,00:13:06,00:13:13,"Now I could only get general rifling characteristics-- six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist, um, but..."
195,00:13:13,00:13:16,But not enough individual characteristics to run it through IBIS.
196,00:13:16,00:13:17,"Exactly. Sorry, man."
197,00:13:17,00:13:19,That's all right.
198,00:13:19,00:13:22,Hodges.
199,00:13:22,00:13:25,Your victim did not have GSR on his hands.
200,00:13:25,00:13:29,"Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?"
201,00:13:29,00:13:36,"Thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree."
202,00:13:36,00:13:40,So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?
203,00:13:40,00:13:42,But I will.
204,00:13:42,00:13:45,That's the beauty of me.
205,00:14:16,00:14:21,"MULLINS: Well, Mr. Miller, what I would recommend is adding some tax-deferred investments to your portfolio."
206,00:14:21,00:14:23,Like a ROTH IRA. That's be perfect for you.
207,00:14:23,00:14:25,MILLER: I never got what that ROTH stood for.

210,00:14:56,00:14:58,"MULLINS: Hey, Kelly. Have a seat."
211,00:14:58,00:14:59,GORDON: Thanks for seeing me.
212,00:14:59,00:15:02,I know you said we didn't have to do this in person.
213,00:15:02,00:15:03,"No, I'm really glad you came."
214,00:15:03,00:15:05,"Kelly, your father loved you very much."
215,00:15:05,00:15:07,A little too much.
216,00:15:07,00:15:09,I just wanted to talk about his estate.
217,00:15:09,00:15:11,Is what he did going to affect it?
218,00:15:11,00:15:12,"Well, it's kind of complicated."

222,00:15:25,00:15:27,"WOMAN: District Four, Parole and Probation."
223,00:15:27,00:15:29,"Yeah, this is Nick Stokes with the Las Vegas Crime Lab."
224,00:15:30,00:15:32,We're trying to reach Kelly Gordon's parole officer.
225,00:15:32,00:15:34,That's me.
226,00:15:34,00:15:37,Great. I need Kelly's contact information.
227,00:15:37,00:15:40,"Sure, but I gave her permission to go out of town."
228,00:15:40,00:15:42,Her bus left a couple hours ago.
229,00:15:45,00:15:47,"Oh, hey, I'm glad you're here."
230,00:15:47,00:15:49,I got the results back from the blood on Bianca's bedroom floor.
231,00:15:49,00:15:51,"The dead guy? Uh, no."
232,00:15:51,00:15:54,"It's a male, but it's not a match to Ahren Green."
233,00:15:54,00:15:58,Then I ran it through CODIS and I actually got a hit.
234,00:15:58,00:16:00,Justin Cole.
235,00:16:00,00:16:04,He's in the system for statutory rape a couple years back.
236,00:16:04,00:16:05,Among other things.
237,00:16:09,00:16:11,"So, why am I here?"
238,00:16:11,00:16:16,"What, you getting homesick for the train tracks behind Union Plaza already?"
239,00:16:18,00:16:20,Bianca Desmond.
240,00:16:20,00:16:23,Girl's like an oven in there.
241,00:16:23,00:16:26,Used to love it in there.
242,00:16:27,00:16:29,How long ago was that?
243,00:16:29,00:16:32,A few months.
244,00:16:32,00:16:36,Did you stop by recently to check out the competition?
245,00:16:36,00:16:39,No. We lost touch.
246,00:16:39,00:16:43,"So it wouldn't bother you to know Bianca's moved on, and she's living with another guy."
247,00:16:43,00:16:45,It was good while it lasted.
248,00:16:45,00:16:47,We found your blood in her bedroom.
249,00:16:48,00:16:49,And her dead boyfriend in the garage.
250,00:16:49,00:16:52,(chuckles)
251,00:16:57,00:16:59,That's funny?
252,00:17:00,00:17:02,Nah.
253,00:17:02,00:17:06,Just... Bianca's all fun and games until someone shoots you in the leg.
254,00:17:06,00:17:07,When was that?
255,00:17:07,00:17:10,Six months ago.
256,00:17:12,00:17:15,"BIANCA: Hey, sweetie, I went shopping with my mom."
257,00:17:15,00:17:17,I'll be home late.
258,00:17:17,00:17:19,There's some candy for you on the table.
259,00:17:19,00:17:20,See you then. Love you.
260,00:17:20,00:17:22,(gunshot)
261,00:17:22,00:17:23,(yelling)
262,00:17:26,00:17:29,MAN: Stay away from Bianca.
263,00:17:29,00:17:32,So I packed my stuff and left.
264,00:17:32,00:17:33,Did you report it?
265,00:17:34,00:17:37,"Nah. Still on probation for that ""she-looked-18"" incident."
266,00:17:37,00:17:39,This the guy who shot you?
267,00:17:40,00:17:43,Didn't really get a good look.
268,00:17:43,00:17:44,I was too busy bleeding.
269,00:17:45,00:17:46,You go to the hospital?
270,00:17:46,00:17:49,Sort of had my own anesthesia thing going on.
271,00:17:49,00:17:51,So whatever happened to the bullet?
272,00:18:09,00:18:14,"Yeah, see, human tissue sticks pretty darn good."
273,00:18:14,00:18:18,"And I can't scalpel it off, because I might damage the bullet's characteristics."
274,00:18:18,00:18:21,"So, uh... so I guess we wait."
275,00:18:21,00:18:26,WARRICK: Half of these tools don't match the size and the shape of the wound.
276,00:18:26,00:18:29,"And the ones that do, don't have blood on them."
277,00:18:29,00:18:31,The killer could have wiped it off.
278,00:18:31,00:18:34,"I don't see why the killer would have used a tool anyway, when he had a gun."
279,00:18:34,00:18:38,Maybe Ahern disarmed him and he grabbed whatever was handy.
280,00:18:45,00:18:47,Take a look at this.
281,00:18:47,00:18:49,This guy was tweaker organized.
282,00:18:49,00:18:50,There's a place for everything.
283,00:18:50,00:18:53,Except for this.
284,00:18:53,00:18:57,It's got no space in the pegboard and it doesn't match any of the sets.
285,00:18:57,00:19:00,How about that? Got anything else?
286,00:19:00,00:19:01,Nope.
287,00:19:01,00:19:02,Print it.
288,00:20:00,00:20:02,"Hey, Tom Harper?"
289,00:20:02,00:20:05,"Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
290,00:20:05,00:20:06,May I ask you a couple questions?
291,00:20:06,00:20:07,Do you know a Bianca Desmond?
292,00:20:07,00:20:08,Sounds familiar.
293,00:20:08,00:20:12,You know she's at 1330 Wildflower Lane.
294,00:20:12,00:20:14,"Oh, yeah, right. Her."
295,00:20:14,00:20:17,I installed some DSL lines there a few days ago.
296,00:20:17,00:20:19,She answered the door in her panties.
297,00:20:19,00:20:22,"So you've got that hard hat, tool belt thing working for you, huh?"
298,00:20:22,00:20:24,I wish.
299,00:20:24,00:20:28,"Kind of girl that makes you happy to be a man, know what I'm saying? Yeah, I kind of remember."
300,00:20:28,00:20:32,"Anyway, we found a tool with your prints on it in a garage, next to a dead guy."
301,00:20:32,00:20:34,Whoa.
302,00:20:34,00:20:36,I-I lost an awl at a job recently.
303,00:20:36,00:20:37,It must have been there.
304,00:20:37,00:20:39,"Well, we're going to need to confirm that."
305,00:20:39,00:20:42,Could you get me a work order?
306,00:20:42,00:20:43,"Yeah, sure."
307,00:20:43,00:20:45,"Um, I'll pull one from the office."
308,00:20:45,00:20:47,I'll run it right over.
309,00:20:50,00:20:54,"Kelly, where you going in such a hurry?"
310,00:20:54,00:20:56,I have relatives in Provo.
311,00:20:56,00:20:59,I was going to visit them.
312,00:20:59,00:21:03,I cleared it with my P.O.
313,00:21:03,00:21:10,You gonna tell me why a state trooper pulled over my bus and yanked me off?
314,00:21:10,00:21:13,You know a lady named Sylvia Mullins?
315,00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
316,00:21:14,00:21:17,Did you have a meeting with her yesterday?
317,00:21:17,00:21:19,Yeah. So?
318,00:21:19,00:21:22,So why did you have a meeting with her?
319,00:21:22,00:21:27,Sylvia's handling my dad's estate. Hmm.
320,00:21:27,00:21:28,She's the trustee.
321,00:21:29,00:21:31,What's going on here?
322,00:21:31,00:21:34,Ms. Mullins was found in her parking garage...
323,00:21:35,00:21:37,crushed by her own car.
324,00:21:37,00:21:41,And you think I have something to do with it.
325,00:21:41,00:21:47,"When you worked in the prison garage, did you just learn how to fix cars or did you learn how to steal them?"
326,00:21:47,00:21:48,Are you kidding me?
327,00:21:48,00:21:50,Does it look like I'm kidding you?
328,00:21:50,00:21:57,You waited for her to get out of work so you could let her know how you felt about her.
329,00:22:01,00:22:02,(engine starts)
330,00:22:05,00:22:08,Sylvia was my dad's friend.
331,00:22:08,00:22:11,She was helping me get back on my feet.
332,00:22:11,00:22:16,How I felt was grateful.
333,00:22:16,00:22:21,CSI puts me in jail for something I didn't do.
334,00:22:21,00:22:24,Do you really think I'm going to kill somebody the minute I get out?
335,00:22:26,00:22:28,Hold out your hands.
336,00:22:30,00:22:31,Hold out your hands.
337,00:22:31,00:22:35,Ms. Mullins' air bag deployed on impact.
338,00:22:35,00:22:37,Air bag dust gets everywhere.
339,00:22:40,00:22:42,It's really hard to get rid of.
340,00:22:42,00:22:45,Not if it isn't there.
341,00:22:53,00:22:56,So the soda can bullet and the leg bullet are from the same gun?
342,00:22:56,00:23:00,"Yeah. Bobby was able to pull more stria off the leg bullet, but still no IBIS hits."
343,00:23:00,00:23:02,"So what about the phone guy, huh?"
344,00:23:02,00:23:03,The utility man's always a shade-ball.
345,00:23:04,00:23:07,"As much as I love your generalizations, actually, this time you're wrong."
346,00:23:07,00:23:11,The metallic scrapes on the garage floor were titanium.
347,00:23:11,00:23:16,The phone guy's tool was carbon steel. Remember we thought that they might be dealing meth?
348,00:23:16,00:23:19,Brass went ahead and subpoenaed the phone and bank records.
349,00:23:19,00:23:22,Guess who's paying Bianca's mortgage?
350,00:23:23,00:23:24,A Mr. Harry Desmond.
351,00:23:24,00:23:25,Happy Harry?
352,00:23:25,00:23:26,Gas n' Sip Harry Desmond?
353,00:23:26,00:23:28,Who's your daddy?
354,00:23:28,00:23:29,No wonder she didn't work.
355,00:23:29,00:23:31,He owns 50 Gas n' Sips in Vegas.
356,00:23:31,00:23:36,"Well, Harry was nice enough to leave us a voice message that was listened to and saved the night of the murder."
357,00:23:38,00:23:39,"Bianca, honey, it's Daddy."
358,00:23:39,00:23:42,I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.
359,00:23:42,00:23:44,"You can borrow the cabin, but we need to talk about this move."
360,00:23:45,00:23:46,"Call me, Princess. I love you."
361,00:23:46,00:23:50,And this is the Desmond cabin in Telluride.
362,00:23:50,00:23:53,"Oh, maybe Mr. Desmond is trying to protect the family fortune."
363,00:23:53,00:23:55,Or the family jewels.
364,00:23:56,00:23:59,I got the results back from all those sex stains on the sheets.
365,00:23:59,00:24:03,"Three donors: Ahren, Bianca and Chelsea."
366,00:24:03,00:24:06,I guess theywerehaving a little threesome.
367,00:24:06,00:24:11,"Yeah, I just really hope he was only doing one woman at a time."
368,00:24:11,00:24:13,Chelsea is Bianca's mother.
369,00:24:19,00:24:24,"Look, I know what it's like to want to kill your daughter's boyfriend."
370,00:24:24,00:24:27,I don't pick fights that I can't win.
371,00:24:27,00:24:30,"I kill this one, I got five more dipsticks waiting to take his place."
372,00:24:30,00:24:32,I'd just be pushing the rock up the hill.
373,00:24:32,00:24:35,"Besides, I was in New York yesterday."
374,00:24:35,00:24:38,"Yeah, but you didn't want them to move away together."
375,00:24:38,00:24:40,I wanted Bianca to get a job.
376,00:24:40,00:24:41,My biggest mistake in life?
377,00:24:41,00:24:44,Giving my baby everything she ever wanted.
378,00:24:44,00:24:46,Your wife doesn't seem to mind your lifestyle.
379,00:24:46,00:24:53,"When Bianca was a teenager, they fought like cats in a sack."
380,00:24:53,00:24:56,It's good they've been spending time together.
381,00:24:58,00:24:59,Do you know what they're doing?
382,00:25:00,00:25:04,"Well... they're shopping, dancing..."
383,00:25:04,00:25:05,"You know, girl stuff."
384,00:25:05,00:25:09,They're sleeping with the same man.
385,00:25:20,00:25:24,Look...
386,00:25:24,00:25:28,there was no good reason for Chelsea to marry me back in the day.
387,00:25:28,00:25:30,I had a little money.
388,00:25:30,00:25:32,Nothing like what we have now.
389,00:25:32,00:25:38,She was half my age and ten times better looking.
390,00:25:38,00:25:47,I thought if I kept her on a long leash...
391,00:25:47,00:25:50,maybe she'd never stray that far.
392,00:25:50,00:25:53,You the kind of guy that likes to keep guns in the house?
393,00:25:53,00:25:55,"Yeah, of course."
394,00:25:55,00:25:58,I'm going to need to see them.
395,00:26:00,00:26:05,"Hey, Catherine, I just got back trace on Kelly Gordon's fingernails."
396,00:26:05,00:26:10,"I was looking for air bag dust, but all Hodges found was air."
397,00:26:10,00:26:11,"Well, join the club."
398,00:26:11,00:26:15,No usable prints on the parking garage camera either.
399,00:26:15,00:26:18,"Okay, I'll have Sofia release her from holding."
400,00:26:18,00:26:20,Those the vic's phone records?
401,00:26:20,00:26:21,Yeah.
402,00:26:21,00:26:22,From her office.
403,00:26:22,00:26:24,Lots of international calls.
404,00:26:26,00:26:28,A lot of 345s. Mm-hmm.
405,00:26:28,00:26:29,Where's that?
406,00:26:29,00:26:30,Cayman Islands.
407,00:26:30,00:26:32,Popular with scuba divers and money launderers.
408,00:26:32,00:26:35,I called a few of the numbers; all banks.
409,00:26:35,00:26:36,Suggests offshore accounts.
410,00:26:37,00:26:39,"It's not illegal, but it is very anonymous."
411,00:26:39,00:26:41,It's also a good way to siphon money away from your clients.
412,00:26:41,00:26:43,That's a leap.
413,00:26:43,00:26:47,"Hey, somebody wanted this woman dead."
414,00:27:12,00:27:14,"GORDON: Hi, CSI guy."
415,00:27:14,00:27:17,You wondering why you're here?
416,00:27:17,00:27:20,Because you followed the evidence.
417,00:27:20,00:27:24,Because that's what CSIs do.
418,00:27:24,00:27:32,"So breathe quick, breathe slow, put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger."
419,00:27:32,00:27:37,"Any way you like, you're going to die here."
420,00:27:37,00:27:40,Okay. Perfect.
421,00:27:46,00:27:50,You're going to die here.
422,00:27:50,00:27:53,Okay. Perfect.
423,00:27:56,00:27:58,"Hey, Archie."
424,00:27:58,00:28:04,"Hey, I did my best to enhance the parking garage footage, but I just can't get an image on the killer's face."
425,00:28:04,00:28:06,"If you got a couple of minutes, I need a voice comparison."
426,00:28:06,00:28:08,"Yeah, what do you got?"
427,00:28:08,00:28:10,Kelly Gordon's voice on tape.
428,00:28:12,00:28:15,I want to see if it's the other voice on the Walter Gordon audio file.
429,00:28:15,00:28:17,Grissom told you.
430,00:28:17,00:28:19,"No, but he obviously told you."
431,00:28:21,00:28:22,"Nick, uh..."
432,00:28:22,00:28:24,You know what? Forget about it.
433,00:28:24,00:28:27,"If this girl's involved, that means she's capable of murder."
434,00:28:27,00:28:28,It's all cued up for you.
435,00:28:28,00:28:30,Her voice is first.
436,00:28:31,00:28:33,"Grissom, it's Warrick."
437,00:28:33,00:28:47,"None of the guns Bobby test-fired were a match to the bullets, but Chelsea Wannamaker purchased a .22 in her name that was not picked up with the warrant for Harry's guns."
438,00:28:47,00:28:49,Okay. I'm on it.
439,00:28:54,00:28:57,Mrs. Wannamaker.
440,00:29:00,00:29:03,"Wow, that's a hell of a rock."
441,00:29:03,00:29:05,I'm surprised I didn't see that the other night.
442,00:29:06,00:29:07,"Well, I don't feel safe wearing this to a club."
443,00:29:07,00:29:09,Is that why you own a gun?
444,00:29:09,00:29:11,"Well, I used to."
445,00:29:11,00:29:15,"But my gun was stolen out of my purse, one night when we went out."
446,00:29:16,00:29:19,Is there something you want to say to me?
447,00:29:19,00:29:23,"You trying to buy back some time there, Mrs. Wannamaker?"
448,00:29:23,00:29:27,"Life's short, but it doesn't end at 40."
449,00:29:27,00:29:29,"Oh, I agree with you."
450,00:29:29,00:29:34,But it must be tough for Bianca to have the kind of mother that'd sleep with her boyfriend.
451,00:29:37,00:29:41,The thing with Ahren the other night shouldn't have happened.
452,00:29:41,00:29:44,We were on Ecstasy...
453,00:29:44,00:29:49,and a line got crossed.
454,00:29:50,00:29:51,"Oh, yeah."
455,00:29:51,00:29:54,Lay down. Okay.
456,00:29:54,00:29:55,I'll come back.
457,00:29:55,00:29:57,"All right, you come right back."
458,00:30:10,00:30:12,(sighs)
459,00:30:15,00:30:19,"Oh, Chelsea, I'm... I'm sorry."
460,00:30:19,00:30:20,I totally thought you were Bianca.
461,00:30:20,00:30:24,That felt so good.
462,00:30:34,00:30:41,Bianca came in and found us.
463,00:30:41,00:30:44,I wish it never would have happened.
464,00:30:44,00:30:48,"What's that, getting busy with her boyfriend or getting caught?"
465,00:30:48,00:30:53,I want into the living room and I let the two of them talk it out.
466,00:30:53,00:31:00,"Next thing I know, she announced that they were moving to Colorado, so it seemed to me like they worked it out."
467,00:31:04,00:31:06,SIDLE: Freud would have a field day with this family.
468,00:31:07,00:31:10,"Dad loves his daughter, but Mom only sees the daughter as competition."
469,00:31:10,00:31:13,And everyone wonders why Bianca can't meet a nice boy.
470,00:31:13,00:31:15,Bianca eats nice boys for brunch.
471,00:31:25,00:31:27,Las Vegas Crime Lab.
472,00:31:41,00:31:43,Oh. Sara.
473,00:31:44,00:31:47,"Bianca, can you hear me?"
474,00:31:47,00:31:49,We need an ambulance.
475,00:31:49,00:31:52,"Dispatch, this is CSI Brown."
476,00:31:52,00:31:54,We have a woman down. We need a paramedic.
477,00:32:03,00:32:04,"Hey, Bianca."
478,00:32:05,00:32:06,How you feeling?
479,00:32:08,00:32:10,Mr. and Mrs. Desmond...
480,00:32:10,00:32:12,It's Wannamaker.
481,00:32:12,00:32:13,She's never changed her name.
482,00:32:13,00:32:18,"Ms. Wannamaker, I'm going to need a few moments alone with Bianca."
483,00:32:29,00:32:32,You never should've told him.
484,00:32:32,00:32:37,My father's an optimist. How do you think they stayed married for 20 years?
485,00:32:37,00:32:44,"Bianca, I'm going to assume that whoever did this to you also killed Ahren."
486,00:32:44,00:32:49,And I'm also going to assume that you know who that is.
487,00:32:52,00:32:56,I think you need to stop protecting everyone from themselves.
488,00:32:56,00:32:58,I can't.
489,00:33:02,00:33:04,Excuse me.
490,00:33:04,00:33:06,I just need to check the swelling.
491,00:33:08,00:33:09,How's the tenderness?
492,00:33:09,00:33:11,It's fine.
493,00:33:15,00:33:16,I hope you feel better.
494,00:33:20,00:33:23,Nurse... Nurse?
495,00:33:23,00:33:25,Can I get that glove you were just using?
496,00:33:25,00:33:28,"I'm Sara Sidle, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab."
497,00:33:29,00:33:31,Here you go.
498,00:33:31,00:33:35,"Thanks. Uh, I'm also going to wait around for the SAE kit."
499,00:33:35,00:33:36,She refused.
500,00:33:42,00:33:44,"Hey, Grissom..."
501,00:33:44,00:33:45,You want to talk to me?
502,00:33:45,00:33:48,"Yeah, sit down."
503,00:33:52,00:33:57,I heard that Kelly Gordon may be a suspect in your murder case.
504,00:33:57,00:33:58,Yeah.
505,00:33:58,00:34:00,Is that a problem?
506,00:34:00,00:34:02,No.
507,00:34:02,00:34:04,"No, it's not a problem."
508,00:34:04,00:34:07,"And by the way, I heard the tape."
509,00:34:07,00:34:09,I did a voice comparison.
510,00:34:10,00:34:13,"SYLVIA MULLINS: ROTH IRA, that'd be perfect for you."
511,00:34:13,00:34:16,Sylvia Mullins is the other voice on the tape.
512,00:34:16,00:34:19,"She's Walter Gordon's ex-business manager, so..."
513,00:34:20,00:34:24,I'm pretty sure she had something to do with my kidnapping.
514,00:34:26,00:34:27,But now she's dead.
515,00:34:27,00:34:30,Yeah.
516,00:34:31,00:34:34,So... it's over.
517,00:34:37,00:34:39,Yep.
518,00:34:39,00:34:40,Good.
519,00:34:41,00:34:43,Good.
520,00:34:52,00:34:56,I think Bianca is covering for her father.
521,00:34:56,00:35:06,"Well, we figured out the sticky stuff on Bianca's neck was creosote. It's a timber preservative found on fences, telephone poles and railroad ties."
522,00:35:06,00:35:08,Justin lives on the train tracks.
523,00:35:08,00:35:10,And he's pretty tweaked out.
524,00:35:10,00:35:12,"Yeah, but he didn't shoot himself."
525,00:35:12,00:35:18,"And I think that if he had done it, Bianca would've told us."
526,00:35:18,00:35:20,What is it?
527,00:35:20,00:35:23,Telephone poles.
528,00:35:23,00:35:29,Tom Harper's work order for Bianca's DSL line was dated December 18.
529,00:35:30,00:35:32,December 18...
530,00:35:33,00:35:36,fell on a Sunday.
531,00:35:36,00:35:38,How many workers you know work on a Sunday?
532,00:35:38,00:35:40,Is this the original document?
533,00:35:40,00:35:42,Yeah.
534,00:35:42,00:35:44,I'm on it.
535,00:35:44,00:35:46,Always the utility guy.
536,00:36:29,00:36:37,"SIDLE: There were two different inks on the work order, which means the date on the work order was compromised."
537,00:36:37,00:36:43,"Tom Harper made a service call to Bianca's house not in December, but ten months earlier, in February."
538,00:36:43,00:36:44,Why would the guy lie?
539,00:36:44,00:36:48,It appears that he was a lot more to her than just the phone guy.
540,00:36:48,00:36:51,Our bachelorette was a very busy girl.
541,00:36:51,00:37:00,"Phone calls from Bianca to Tom are in yellow, from Bianca to Justin are in blue, and from Bianca to Ahren are in pink."
542,00:37:00,00:37:01,There was always overlap.
543,00:37:01,00:37:07,"Bachelor number one: Tom, phone guy-- strong showing from February 18 until June-ish."
544,00:37:07,00:37:09,"She called him two, three times a day."
545,00:37:09,00:37:15,"And then around June 5, bachelor number two enters the picture-- Justin."
546,00:37:15,00:37:19,Ten days of overlap and then all the calls to Tom stopped until...
547,00:37:19,00:37:21,The week Justin was shot and moved out.
548,00:37:21,00:37:22,Exactly.
549,00:37:23,00:37:28,Ahren entered the picture about five days later in mid-September.
550,00:37:28,00:37:33,"At that point, all the phone calls to the other guys stopped until just about a week ago."
551,00:37:33,00:37:35,When she started calling Tom again.
552,00:37:35,00:37:38,"Every time this chick calls Tom, somebody gets shot."
553,00:37:38,00:37:39,It's like thermite.
554,00:37:39,00:37:41,Thermite?
555,00:37:41,00:37:48,"When you combine two seemingly harmless elements-- aluminum and rust-- press them together, add heat..."
556,00:37:48,00:37:51,it creates an explosion so hot it'll burn through steel.
557,00:37:51,00:37:53,Powerful but uncontrollable.
558,00:37:53,00:37:59,"It burns and burns until it burns itself out, finally consuming both elements."
559,00:37:59,00:38:01,I guess some people just shouldn't be together.
560,00:38:13,00:38:16,Tom Harper! Come on down!
561,00:38:20,00:38:22,"You made me find you twice, Tom, that's a drag."
562,00:38:23,00:38:24,What's the problem?
563,00:38:24,00:38:28,"You know, I think you saw Bianca in her panties more than once."
564,00:38:28,00:38:30,SIDLE: Now those could change a man.
565,00:38:32,00:38:35,And it looks like they did.
566,00:38:37,00:38:39,"BRASS: You know, it's fill in the blank."
567,00:38:39,00:38:41,"If it walks like a stalker, talks like a stalker..."
568,00:38:41,00:38:43,I'm not a stalker.
569,00:38:43,00:38:44,Then what's this?
570,00:38:44,00:38:46,Excellent service?
571,00:38:46,00:38:49,Here's the top of the telephone pole near Bianca's house.
572,00:38:49,00:38:54,"Ahren was tapping your girl, so you started tapping her phone."
573,00:38:56,00:38:58,I only listened when I thought she was in trouble.
574,00:38:58,00:39:02,"Look, her father called her at 7:00 a.m. New York time, that's 4:00 in the morning in Vegas."
575,00:39:02,00:39:06,You had to be on the pole to hear it because we were on the scene an hour later.
576,00:39:06,00:39:09,"HARRY DESMOND: Biana, honey, it's Daddy."
577,00:39:09,00:39:12,I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.
578,00:39:13,00:39:15,Stay away from Bianca.
579,00:39:15,00:39:16,Who are you?
580,00:39:16,00:39:18,You're not taking her to Colorado.
581,00:39:18,00:39:20,The hell I'm not.
582,00:39:22,00:39:23,(gunshot)
583,00:39:45,00:39:48,I just wanted her to be happy.
584,00:39:48,00:39:50,With you and no one else. No.
585,00:39:50,00:39:52,Those other guys were jerks.
586,00:39:52,00:39:54,I only wanted to scare him off.
587,00:39:54,00:39:56,"Oh, like you did with Justin? That worked."
588,00:39:56,00:40:00,"Yeah, but Bianca didn't come running back to you, so I guess you had to scare her, too."
589,00:40:00,00:40:02,What are you doing here?
590,00:40:02,00:40:03,I came to see you.
591,00:40:03,00:40:04,I think you should leave.
592,00:40:04,00:40:06,Your mom wants us to be together.
593,00:40:06,00:40:07,My mom?!
594,00:40:07,00:40:09,Let go!
595,00:40:11,00:40:16,Her mother and I weren't always going to be around to clean up her messes.
596,00:40:16,00:40:18,Wait a minute.
597,00:40:18,00:40:22,Are you telling me that Chelsea asked you to hurt these guys?
598,00:40:24,00:40:32,So you have some lunatic stalker telephone repairman claiming that I told him to kill my daughter's boyfriends?
599,00:40:32,00:40:34,Give me a break.
600,00:40:35,00:40:38,We have multiple calls to him from Bianca's house and it was not her.
601,00:40:38,00:40:42,We also have on the record that you called him from your cell.
602,00:40:42,00:40:45,"Coincidentally, right around the time Justin was shot and Ahren was killed."
603,00:40:46,00:40:49,We call that solicitation for murder.
604,00:40:49,00:40:51,"But you'd probably call it, what, good mother?"
605,00:40:51,00:40:52,I love my daughter.
606,00:40:52,00:40:55,"Yeah, apparently, a lot of her boyfriends, too."
607,00:40:55,00:40:58,I called Tom.
608,00:40:58,00:41:02,I asked him to scare Justin away.
609,00:41:02,00:41:03,He was after Bianca for her money.
610,00:41:03,00:41:05,"I mean, we have to protect ourselves."
611,00:41:05,00:41:09,"Yeah, but Ahren didn't love her for her money."
612,00:41:09,00:41:12,What was wrong with him?
613,00:41:12,00:41:18,"So he was good enough for you, but too good for your daughter, was that it?"
614,00:41:18,00:41:23,"I mean, finding a soul mate is hard enough, but competing with your mother, that shouldn't be an issue."
615,00:41:23,00:41:27,"That goes against... I don't know, nature."
616,00:41:27,00:41:31,I was attracted to Ahren...
617,00:41:31,00:41:36,and I was just trying to keep him away from Bianca and me.
618,00:41:36,00:41:41,"Lady, you unleashed an unstable man that you knew was in love with your daughter."
619,00:41:42,00:41:45,You had to know that that was not going to end well.
620,00:41:48,00:41:50,"WILLOWS: Oh, hey, Nick."
621,00:41:50,00:41:53,Nick. Yeah?
622,00:41:53,00:41:55,We caught a break.
623,00:41:55,00:41:57,The security guard confessed.
624,00:41:57,00:41:59,No.
625,00:41:59,00:42:04,Archie isolated a frame of the killer turning the focus ring.
626,00:42:13,00:42:15,She did it.
627,00:42:23,00:42:25,Las Vegas Police! Open up!
628,00:42:31,00:42:34,"Kelly Gordon, you're under arrest for the murder of Sylvia Mullins."
629,00:42:34,00:42:36,Stand up.
630,00:42:36,00:42:38,Stand up!
631,00:42:43,00:42:44,Care why I did it?
632,00:42:44,00:42:47,Doesn't really matter now.
633,00:42:47,00:42:50,She told me my dad didn't leave me anything.
634,00:42:50,00:42:52,He never would've done that.
635,00:42:52,00:42:55,He loved me.
636,00:42:55,00:42:57,So you killed her?
637,00:42:57,00:42:59,The ransom was her idea.
638,00:42:59,00:43:01,She didn't get the money.
639,00:43:01,00:43:02,She took it from me.
640,00:43:07,00:43:08,She's ODing. She's ODing right now.
641,00:43:08,00:43:09,Call a paramedic.
642,00:43:09,00:43:11,"Vicodine, INH, methadone."
643,00:43:11,00:43:14,Kelly! Kelly!
644,00:43:14,00:43:15,Kelly!
