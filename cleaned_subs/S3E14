0,00:00:19,00:00:20,(soft clattering)
1,00:00:28,00:00:29,(soft squeak)
2,00:01:13,00:01:14,(woman screaming)
3,00:01:18,00:01:19,(screaming)
4,00:01:27,00:01:29,Dispatch said breaking and entering and sexual assault?
5,00:01:29,00:01:31,"Well, he never touched the first girl."
6,00:01:31,00:01:32,The bedroom door was blocked.
7,00:01:33,00:01:34,"What do you mean, ""blocked""?"
8,00:01:34,00:01:35,With a treadmill.
9,00:01:35,00:01:38,We've got two apartments here; 1213 and 1214.
10,00:01:38,00:01:41,We think the girl in 1214 has physical findings.
11,00:01:41,00:01:42,You think?
12,00:01:42,00:01:46,"Well, she locked herself in her bedroom, won't let anyone with a Y chromosome within 50 feet of her."
13,00:01:46,00:01:48,Okay.
14,00:01:49,00:01:51,That's the lucky one.
15,00:01:53,00:01:54,"Hey, guys."
16,00:01:54,00:01:57,Catherine Willows from CSI.
17,00:01:57,00:01:59,"Could you all clear the residence, please?"
18,00:01:59,00:02:01,"I'm first officer, ma'am."
19,00:02:01,00:02:04,I can't leave a crime scene unless I get orders from my CO.
20,00:02:06,00:02:09,The victim's well-being takes precedence over everything.
21,00:02:09,00:02:12,"Right now, this is Joanne Crooks' apartment, not our crime scene."
22,00:02:12,00:02:15,So... there's the door.
23,00:02:15,00:02:17,"All right, come on."
24,00:02:20,00:02:22,Thanks. Thank you.
25,00:02:24,00:02:26,Appreciate it.
26,00:02:31,00:02:33,Doreen Bainbridge locks her doors every night.
27,00:02:33,00:02:35,Says the girl next does the same.
28,00:02:35,00:02:37,It's a twist lock.
29,00:02:37,00:02:40,It allows for five inches of night air.
30,00:02:40,00:02:42,It's very secure...
31,00:02:42,00:02:44,unless you reach in...
32,00:02:47,00:02:49,Three seconds.
33,00:02:51,00:02:54,"Crime of opportunity, huh?"
34,00:02:54,00:02:55,Yeah...
35,00:03:02,00:03:05,...except somebody was watching this girl.
36,00:03:39,00:03:40,WILLOWS: Joanne...
37,00:03:40,00:03:41,all the guys have left.
38,00:03:41,00:03:43,It's just me.
39,00:03:43,00:03:45,I'd like to ask...
40,00:03:45,00:03:48,"I told you guys, I don't know what he looked like, okay?"
41,00:03:48,00:03:49,It was pitch black.
42,00:03:49,00:03:52,"Well, I'm not a cop; I'm with the crime lab."
43,00:03:52,00:03:56,"I'd, uh, I'd like to process the bed sheets..."
44,00:03:56,00:03:57,I don't think so.
45,00:03:57,00:04:00,"Well, would you allow me to take samples from you?"
46,00:04:00,00:04:01,Sorry.
47,00:04:03,00:04:06,"Look, I know this is really horrible."
48,00:04:06,00:04:08,"I want to get the bastard off of me, okay?"
49,00:04:08,00:04:09,Off of my things.
50,00:04:09,00:04:10,Don't you get that?
51,00:04:10,00:04:15,Washing away evidence hurts any chance of finding out who raped you.
52,00:04:15,00:04:19,"He didn't rape me, okay?"
53,00:04:19,00:04:22,I woke up and he was on my chest.
54,00:04:24,00:04:26,Look at this.
55,00:04:26,00:04:29,It's not hair gel.
56,00:04:31,00:04:35,"If you let me recover that evidence, we can stop him from doing this to somebody else."
57,00:04:36,00:04:36,Maybe I'm selfish.
58,00:04:37,00:04:39,I don't know; I don't really care about anybody else right now.
59,00:04:39,00:04:42,"Well, then let's get him for what he did to you."
60,00:04:53,00:04:55,(camera shutter clicks)
61,00:05:36,00:05:38,"STOKES: Hey, Grissom."
62,00:05:38,00:05:40,Got what looks like a semen stain.
63,00:05:40,00:05:42,"It's crusted, it's not fresh."
64,00:05:42,00:05:47,"Still, it confirms your theory that he's been watching her for awhile."
65,00:05:48,00:05:50,Hey...
66,00:06:02,00:06:06,He's been watching a lot of people.
67,00:06:06,00:06:12,"Well, there are hedges outside of every one of these apartment windows-- that's built-in concealment."
68,00:06:12,00:06:17,"Yeah, this guy was having his own little private peep show."
69,00:06:17,00:06:19,I...
70,00:06:21,00:06:24,"WOMAN: Last, I would like to thank you for working late into the night."
71,00:06:24,00:06:30,"During this trial, you have heard people portray the defendant in glowing terms."
72,00:06:31,00:06:34,He may be all of these things.
73,00:06:34,00:06:36,He certainly seems likable.
74,00:06:36,00:06:47,"That doesn't change the fact that he got behind the wheel of his car legally drunk, and drove through an intersection, killing Shelley Daniels, a 12-year-old child."
75,00:06:47,00:06:57,"When you go into that jury room, I ask that you seek justice and return with a verdict of guilty."
76,00:06:57,00:07:02,"Not for me, not for His Honor, not even for Shelly Daniels."
77,00:07:02,00:07:06,I ask because justice itself demands it.
78,00:07:06,00:07:09,Justice is greater than our personal feelings.
79,00:07:09,00:07:12,"Than... revenge, than... than pity."
80,00:07:12,00:07:17,"Do not shrink, do not disappoint, but rather..."
81,00:07:17,00:07:20,embrace it.
82,00:07:22,00:07:24,Thank you.
83,00:07:24,00:07:27,JUDGE: The jury may retire to the jury room.
84,00:07:27,00:07:30,I'll advise counsel when the jury has reached a verdict.
85,00:07:33,00:07:34,Where do I sign up?
86,00:07:34,00:07:37,I wish you could.
87,00:07:37,00:07:39,I'm sorry. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
88,00:07:39,00:07:41,Your message said it was important.
89,00:07:41,00:07:43,"Yes,People v. Archer."
90,00:07:43,00:07:44,Trial's on deck this Thursday.
91,00:07:44,00:07:45,I prepped all weekend.
92,00:07:45,00:07:46,It should be a slam dunk.
93,00:07:46,00:07:48,Great.
94,00:07:48,00:07:51,"I've handed the case over to another D.A., Greg Rubio."
95,00:07:51,00:07:52,What?
96,00:07:52,00:07:55,"He's quick on forensics, he's great on game day."
97,00:07:55,00:07:58,"Melissa, we've been building this case together for six months."
98,00:07:58,00:07:59,What's going on?
99,00:08:01,00:08:03,I'll be dead.
100,00:08:05,00:08:09,"I never felt comfortable asking you about your, uh..."
101,00:08:09,00:08:10,My wheels?
102,00:08:10,00:08:14,"I mean, I know somebody broke into your house shot you and your husband."
103,00:08:14,00:08:17,"Made me a widow, left me a souvenir."
104,00:08:20,00:08:25,"At the time, the doctors said if they removed it, I'd die."
105,00:08:25,00:08:30,"But in the last few years, the bullet has meandered."
106,00:08:30,00:08:32,"Last week, my voice gives out during a cross."
107,00:08:32,00:08:34,I have trouble swallowing.
108,00:08:34,00:08:36,Hand starts to shake.
109,00:08:36,00:08:43,"My neuro calls it ""traumatic basilar artery aneurysm."" Um, he has to ""clip"" the artery."
110,00:08:43,00:08:46,"Well, if they're fixing the artery, that's good."
111,00:08:46,00:08:48,The operation's delicate.
112,00:08:48,00:08:51,"The odds are, well... low."
113,00:08:51,00:08:54,"I've really enjoyed working with you, Sara."
114,00:09:06,00:09:07,Greg...
115,00:09:07,00:09:10,get anywhere with the semen I recovered from Joanne Crooks' hair?
116,00:09:11,00:09:12,I sent it back with an officer.
117,00:09:12,00:09:14,"Uh, low volume, no sperm."
118,00:09:14,00:09:15,That's impossible.
119,00:09:16,00:09:18,"Yeah, I knew you'd say that."
120,00:09:20,00:09:24,"Oh, the trailer before the movie."
121,00:09:24,00:09:25,Sorry.
122,00:09:26,00:09:28,"Hey, Grissom, thanks for the lift."
123,00:09:29,00:09:31,"Grissom, uh..."
124,00:09:32,00:09:33,Grissom?
125,00:09:35,00:09:37,"(soft, distorted): That must be some good evidence."
126,00:09:37,00:09:39,You have evidence?
127,00:09:39,00:09:42,(distortion continues): No.
128,00:09:42,00:09:52,"It turns out the semen in the vic's hair was pre-ejaculate, which, of course, (louder and clearer): carries no sperm, therefore, no DNA."
129,00:09:52,00:09:56,"(normal voice): So, I got this poor woman's hopes up for nothing."
130,00:09:56,00:09:57,How about you?
131,00:09:58,00:10:00,I went back to the crime stats...
132,00:10:00,00:10:06,pulled up all the reported Peeping Toms in a two-block radius over the last year.
133,00:10:08,00:10:10,Unsolved...
134,00:10:10,00:10:12,Any of these women get a description?
135,00:10:12,00:10:16,"He had ""raccoon eyes."" And that's about it."
136,00:10:16,00:10:19,"Plus, nobody called in any follow-up reports."
137,00:10:19,00:10:29,"Well, I guess half the problem's the name-- ""Peeping Tom."" It just sounds so innocuous when, in fact, peeping is the first step in the evolution of a sexual predator."
138,00:10:29,00:10:32,And I'm afraid our Tom is on an escalated pace.
139,00:10:32,00:10:42,Tonight was his first breaking and entering with an immediate second B&amp;amp;E plus what appears to be his first sexual assault.
140,00:10:42,00:10:44,"Well, we know what road this guy's on."
141,00:10:44,00:10:47,It's just a matter of time before he rapes and murders.
142,00:10:47,00:10:51,Yeah... we better find him.
143,00:10:57,00:11:03,"Victims' profile: Both women are single, under 30, live right next door to each other in a large apartment complex."
144,00:11:03,00:11:06,Have we had any luck on cross-referencing any of the guys in their lives?
145,00:11:06,00:11:08,"Uh, no crossover so far."
146,00:11:08,00:11:15,"Doreen Bainbridge works in the corporate field and Joanne Crooks is a dancer, so feels like completely different social circles."
147,00:11:15,00:11:20,"But they're in the predator's comfort zone which means he probably lives in the area, too."
148,00:11:20,00:11:21,What else?
149,00:11:21,00:11:24,We're still working on some shoe prints but the plaster's still wet.
150,00:11:24,00:11:25,Blow dry it.
151,00:11:25,00:11:28,It'll give us approximate height and shoe size.
152,00:11:28,00:11:31,"Yeah, and the semen sample I recovered is still being processed in DNA. Not anymore."
153,00:11:31,00:11:33,I'm done.
154,00:11:33,00:11:36,And no jokes about me being fast in this department.
155,00:11:36,00:11:41,The ejaculate outside the first girl's window-- Spank high? Good news: it does have DNA.
156,00:11:41,00:11:43,Whose? I don't know.
157,00:11:43,00:11:45,"Ran it through CODIS, nothing kicked out."
158,00:11:45,00:11:48,"Well, it's possible this guy's so new he doesn't even have a record."
159,00:11:48,00:11:51,"Well, I can tell you this about him: really low sperm count."
160,00:11:51,00:11:53,Sample hardly had any swimmers.
161,00:11:53,00:11:55,That's probably from excessive masturbation.
162,00:11:56,00:11:59,Guy's been outpacing his ability to produce sperm.
163,00:11:59,00:12:01,"Yeah, you'd know it, Spanky."
164,00:12:01,00:12:02,It's just a hunch.
165,00:12:02,00:12:04,"Hey, that can happen to any guy."
166,00:12:04,00:12:07,"WARRICK: Yeah, not outside some poor woman's bedroom window."
167,00:12:07,00:12:09,"All right, let's keep after it."
168,00:12:09,00:12:11,This guy won't stop till he's caught.
169,00:12:19,00:12:20,"Hey, Doc."
170,00:12:20,00:12:21,You got a minute?
171,00:12:21,00:12:22,"Sure, just finishing."
172,00:12:22,00:12:27,Some people actually do die of natural causes in Vegas you know. So I hear.
173,00:12:27,00:12:28,So what's on your mind?
174,00:12:28,00:12:32,Um... a friend of mine's going in for surgery.
175,00:12:32,00:12:34,Traumatic basilar artery aneurysm.
176,00:12:34,00:12:37,"You, uh, mind walking me through it?"
177,00:12:37,00:12:39,It's a rough procedure.
178,00:12:39,00:12:42,The basilar is the chief blood supplier to the brain stem.
179,00:12:42,00:12:43,"Here, I'll show you."
180,00:12:43,00:12:51,"They put the patient under hypothermic arrest, meaning the heart will be stopped and blood artificially circulated."
181,00:12:51,00:12:56,The objective is to decrease blood pressure so the aneurysm can be clipped.
182,00:12:56,00:12:59,Imagine taking a knife to a balloon.
183,00:12:59,00:13:02,(beeping)
184,00:13:03,00:13:06,The neurosurgeon has just under an hour.
185,00:13:06,00:13:11,"One slip, the artery ruptures causing a catastrophic brain hemorrhage."
186,00:13:11,00:13:13,She said she was going to die.
187,00:13:13,00:13:17,"Nine out of ten times, Sara."
188,00:13:17,00:13:19,I'm sure her doctor told her.
189,00:13:19,00:13:21,Thanks.
190,00:13:23,00:13:26,"Excuse me, do you know where I can find Dr. Stewart?"
191,00:13:26,00:13:27,Thanks.
192,00:13:28,00:13:30,Dr. Stewart. Sara Sidle.
193,00:13:30,00:13:32,I'm a friend of Melissa Winters.
194,00:13:32,00:13:34,She pulled through. No change to mobility She did?
195,00:13:34,00:13:36,"but cognitively, she'll be sharp as ever."
196,00:13:36,00:13:39,Not quite ready to entertain visitors but you can drop by tomorrow.
197,00:13:39,00:13:42,Thanks. Thank you. Okay.
198,00:13:42,00:13:43,"Hey, Doc."
199,00:13:43,00:13:47,"Yeah? When you were in there did you, by any chance, remove the bullet?"
200,00:13:47,00:13:51,"Yeah, after I repaired the artery I figured it couldn't do any more damage than it already has."
201,00:13:51,00:13:52,You think I could have it?
202,00:13:53,00:13:54,"I'm, uh..."
203,00:13:54,00:13:55,I'm with the Crime Lab.
204,00:13:55,00:13:57,It's the only evidence in a cold case.
205,00:13:57,00:13:59,Yeah. Wait here and I'll have it sent out.
206,00:14:02,00:14:04,(whirring)
207,00:14:29,00:14:31,"Hey, how's it coming?"
208,00:14:31,00:14:32,Good.
209,00:14:32,00:14:34,Looks like I got a size eight.
210,00:14:34,00:14:36,"Check back with me, I should have more in a bit."
211,00:14:36,00:14:37,All right.
212,00:14:39,00:14:40,"Hey, Jacqui."
213,00:14:41,00:14:42,Grissom's print any good?
214,00:14:42,00:14:44,The deposition pressure's heavy.
215,00:14:44,00:14:46,The guy was really pressing hard on that window.
216,00:14:46,00:14:47,"With one hand, anyway."
217,00:14:49,00:14:52,"Okay, well, that's a lot of distortion. Yeah."
218,00:14:52,00:14:56,Platform ridges of the latent print were affected by the shift of the core away from the triradius.
219,00:14:56,00:14:59,So can you enhance the ridges equal to the amount of the slippage?
220,00:14:59,00:15:01,Mm-hmm. With the help of this software.
221,00:15:09,00:15:11,Now let's hope this guy's in one of our databases.
222,00:15:11,00:15:12,"Well, I'd run APIS last."
223,00:15:12,00:15:14,I doubt if he's in there; he wasn't in CODIS.
224,00:15:15,00:15:16,No criminal record?
225,00:15:16,00:15:18,"We're dealing with a newbie, a teenager."
226,00:15:18,00:15:19,It's kind of looking like that.
227,00:15:30,00:15:32,"Justin Lamond, 18."
228,00:15:32,00:15:35,Non-gaming card.
229,00:15:35,00:15:36,He's a pool boy at the Tangiers.
230,00:15:37,00:15:39,"Oh, and look at that."
231,00:15:39,00:15:42,He lives one block from the crime scene.
232,00:15:42,00:15:43,"Thanks, Jacqui."
233,00:15:45,00:15:46,Hey.
234,00:15:46,00:15:47,Hey.
235,00:15:47,00:15:52,So the owner of the pool company says he spends his lunch hour here every day.
236,00:15:52,00:15:54,"Well, that's what he looks like."
237,00:16:00,00:16:01,I'll be this way.
238,00:16:30,00:16:32,Jim.
239,00:16:34,00:16:35,"There, that's him."
240,00:16:37,00:16:41,"Yeah, how can you miss him? Kid's pitching a tent."
241,00:16:47,00:16:48,Justin Lamond?
242,00:16:49,00:16:50,"Yeah? Come with me, Justin."
243,00:16:50,00:16:52,Hey...
244,00:16:52,00:16:53,nice fanny pack.
245,00:16:53,00:16:55,"I mean, I'm a wallet guy myself, but I can change."
246,00:16:55,00:16:57,Mind if I take a look at yours?
247,00:16:57,00:16:58,I'm not doing anything.
248,00:16:58,00:16:59,Pack's a camouflage.
249,00:16:59,00:17:02,And check out the tip of his right shoe.
250,00:17:11,00:17:13,It's a spy camera.
251,00:17:13,00:17:18,"What, you can't peep in apartments during the day so you come to the mall to sneak some thrills?"
252,00:17:18,00:17:20,I don't know what you're talking about. I'm late for work.
253,00:17:20,00:17:22,"No, your lunch hour just got very long."
254,00:17:22,00:17:23,Put him in the car.
255,00:17:23,00:17:25,Heck of a lot of tissue attached.
256,00:17:25,00:17:28,Let me guess-- this has been in your victim for a while.
257,00:17:28,00:17:29,Three years.
258,00:17:29,00:17:33,"Prosecutor friend of mine walked in to find a guy shooting her husband, then he turned the gun on her."
259,00:17:33,00:17:35,She just had it surgically removed.
260,00:17:35,00:17:37,The human body's amazing. Three years.
261,00:17:37,00:17:41,Tissue forms around the projectile protecting the body from the leaching of the lead.
262,00:17:41,00:17:43,Hang on a second.
263,00:17:43,00:17:45,You get approval from Grissom?
264,00:17:45,00:17:46,I don't want him walking in on me.
265,00:17:46,00:17:47,Yeah.
266,00:17:47,00:17:49,Sara Sidle...?
267,00:17:49,00:17:50,"Yeah, I did."
268,00:17:50,00:17:52,"All right, just checking."
269,00:17:52,00:17:54,Let's go.
270,00:17:57,00:18:01,Enzymatic detergent ought to clean this baby up.
271,00:18:11,00:18:14,Still stained.
272,00:18:14,00:18:17,All righty...
273,00:18:17,00:18:18,time to get serious.
274,00:18:25,00:18:28,(low buzzing)
275,00:18:28,00:18:31,"Hey, hey, careful with that bullet, it's my only evidence."
276,00:18:31,00:18:33,"I thought you said the husband got shot, too."
277,00:18:33,00:18:34,It was a through and through.
278,00:18:34,00:18:36,The bullet decimated upon impact with the couch...
279,00:18:36,00:18:38,with the couch frame.
280,00:18:47,00:18:51,"Hey, clean as a whistle."
281,00:18:51,00:18:53,We're good to go.
282,00:18:53,00:18:54,I'll run it through IBIS.
283,00:18:54,00:18:55,Thank you.
284,00:18:55,00:18:56,Page me?
285,00:18:57,00:18:58,"Yeah, sure thing."
286,00:18:58,00:19:00,(door closes)
287,00:19:00,00:19:05,How long you been doing this-- videotaping women without their knowledge?
288,00:19:05,00:19:07,It's only breaking the law if you record their voices.
289,00:19:07,00:19:09,"He's a smart kid, huh?"
290,00:19:09,00:19:11,"Oh, come on..."
291,00:19:11,00:19:13,look at the girls out there.
292,00:19:13,00:19:16,"They wear see-through tops, short skirts bellies all on show."
293,00:19:16,00:19:17,They so much want it.
294,00:19:17,00:19:19,So I catch some money shots.
295,00:19:19,00:19:22,"Well, let's look at the young Kubrick's money shot, shall we?"
296,00:19:41,00:19:44,You guys are looking at me like I'm some scab.
297,00:19:44,00:19:47,"I don't do toilets, fat chicks, blue vein, crush stuff."
298,00:19:47,00:19:49,Just low-tech voyeur.
299,00:19:49,00:19:50,That's reassuring.
300,00:19:51,00:19:52,Do you know Doreen Bainbridge?
301,00:19:52,00:19:54,No.
302,00:19:54,00:19:56,We found your fingerprints on her window.
303,00:19:56,00:19:59,And also a little love graffiti on the wall outside.
304,00:19:59,00:20:03,"I spy, I don't engage."
305,00:20:03,00:20:05,"Well, remind me to give you a medal."
306,00:20:10,00:20:12,Stand up.
307,00:20:15,00:20:17,Step down.
308,00:20:17,00:20:19,Both feet.
309,00:20:39,00:20:40,It's not a match.
310,00:20:41,00:20:42,You got to be kidding me.
311,00:20:42,00:20:43,Three-size differential.
312,00:20:43,00:20:47,"He was obviously outside Doreen's apartment, but he's not our guy."
313,00:20:47,00:20:48,He's my guy.
314,00:20:48,00:20:49,Justin Lamond...
315,00:20:49,00:20:54,"sexually motivated offense, indecent exposure, gross lewdness. Let's go to booking."
316,00:20:54,00:20:55,Try to keep it on ice.
317,00:20:55,00:20:58,What's up?
318,00:20:58,00:21:03,"Hey, this cast that poured into the shoe print that I found outside that victim's bedroom window..."
319,00:21:04,00:21:06,Yeah.
320,00:21:06,00:21:08,Pulled off some trace materials from it.
321,00:21:08,00:21:10,It's like a yellow substance. It may be paint.
322,00:21:10,00:21:12,Take a look and tell me what you think.
323,00:21:12,00:21:13,Check it out.
324,00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
325,00:21:14,00:21:16,With glass.
326,00:21:16,00:21:17,Reflective glass.
327,00:21:17,00:21:21,"Yeah, I'm thinking maybe road paint..."
328,00:21:21,00:21:24,crosswalk... lane markings maybe.
329,00:21:24,00:21:27,So our suspect stepped in wet maintenance paint.
330,00:21:27,00:21:29,That stuff dries pretty fast.
331,00:21:29,00:21:32,So he must've stepped in it on his way to the scene.
332,00:21:34,00:21:37,Which could tell us what direction he's coming from.
333,00:21:37,00:21:39,Let me call my guy in the Department of Transpo.
334,00:21:44,00:21:46,Still charting recent Toms?
335,00:21:47,00:21:48,Architecture.
336,00:21:48,00:21:50,He has a type.
337,00:21:50,00:21:53,All these buildings that recently reported Peeping Toms?
338,00:21:53,00:21:56,Got floor plans from the management company.
339,00:21:56,00:21:58,"A-- second story, three bedroom."
340,00:21:58,00:22:02,"B-- ground floor, two bedrooms, center lots."
341,00:22:02,00:22:05,C... C-plans are all one bedroom on the end.
342,00:22:05,00:22:09,"Cheapest rent, highest foot traffic easiest to break in."
343,00:22:09,00:22:10,He's a C-level man.
344,00:22:10,00:22:11,Yeah.
345,00:22:12,00:22:14,And every apartment has sliding doors and windows.
346,00:22:15,00:22:17,"Not one sash, not one French."
347,00:22:17,00:22:20,"And he gets there on foot, from east of Avon."
348,00:22:20,00:22:21,You found his epicenter?
349,00:22:21,00:22:22,Closing in on it.
350,00:22:22,00:22:26,The city painted double yellows down Taylor Road last night.
351,00:22:26,00:22:28,Started at 10:00 at Avon Avenue.
352,00:22:28,00:22:31,The paint crew goes three miles an hour.
353,00:22:31,00:22:37,"That puts them at Taylor and Cedar-- the victims' apartments-- at approximately 20 after 10:00, just before the attacks."
354,00:22:37,00:22:42,Predators usually widen their comfort zone in a spiral pattern outward.
355,00:22:48,00:22:51,"My God, look at all the C-level apartments."
356,00:22:51,00:22:53,P.D.'s going to have to triple their presence.
357,00:22:53,00:22:55,Quadruple it.
358,00:22:55,00:22:57,GRISSOM: He hit two apartments in one night.
359,00:22:58,00:23:00,He's become compulsive.
360,00:23:00,00:23:03,WILLOWS: Predators get smarter with every attack.
361,00:23:04,00:23:05,It's been in the news.
362,00:23:05,00:23:07,He may be wearing gloves this time.
363,00:23:07,00:23:09,"GRISSOM: Yeah, he's evolving..."
364,00:23:10,00:23:11,perfecting.
365,00:23:15,00:23:16,(telephone ringing)
366,00:23:17,00:23:19,AV Lab. Grissom.
367,00:23:19,00:23:20,Your sexual assailant moved up to rape.
368,00:23:21,00:23:22,"Would you be exact, please?"
369,00:23:22,00:23:23,490 Kildare Road.
370,00:23:23,00:23:25,Get here as soon as you can.
371,00:23:25,00:23:26,Thank you.
372,00:23:36,00:23:37,Aren't you coming?
373,00:23:37,00:23:40,You can handle it.
374,00:23:40,00:23:44,"High-profile case, technicalities..."
375,00:23:44,00:23:47,"That can't be why you do this, why you hang back and hide out."
376,00:23:47,00:23:50,You look better on-camera.
377,00:23:50,00:23:51,Right.
378,00:23:51,00:23:53,I didn't think so.
379,00:23:58,00:23:59,BRASS: So where's Grissom?
380,00:23:59,00:24:01,Supervising.
381,00:24:01,00:24:05,So I'm listening to news radio on the way over here and they're calling him the sliding-door rapist.
382,00:24:05,00:24:07,"Well, we got Susie Spiegel."
383,00:24:07,00:24:09,She was unable to ID her assailant.
384,00:24:09,00:24:11,There was penetration this time.
385,00:24:11,00:24:12,She said he was polite.
386,00:24:13,00:24:14,He wore a condom.
387,00:24:14,00:24:15,Polite?
388,00:24:15,00:24:16,He's just more savvy.
389,00:24:16,00:24:19,There's less evidence for us to work with.
390,00:24:19,00:24:20,"I know, exactly."
391,00:24:20,00:24:22,WOMAN: Hey! Over here! Police!
392,00:24:22,00:24:24,"Come on, you pervert! Hey! Hey!"
393,00:24:24,00:24:26,"Oh, well, you're not such a hotshot once a real woman gets a hold of you."
394,00:24:27,00:24:27,"Slow it down, Xena."
395,00:24:28,00:24:28,It's all right. Okay.
396,00:24:29,00:24:30,"Look, I saw him in the bushes."
397,00:24:30,00:24:31,I scared him.
398,00:24:31,00:24:32,"I know, I know. I understand."
399,00:24:32,00:24:34,"Okay, get some ID on these people, all right?"
400,00:24:34,00:24:35,"Let's all go downtown, all right?"
401,00:24:35,00:24:36,I got him.
402,00:24:36,00:24:38,You're not gonna-- you're dead.
403,00:24:38,00:24:39,"Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine."
404,00:24:49,00:24:51,Victor?
405,00:24:52,00:24:54,Victor!
406,00:25:05,00:25:07,"Hey, Sara."
407,00:25:07,00:25:09,Heard you reopened the Winters case.
408,00:25:09,00:25:12,"Did you know the lead CSI on this case, Terry Flannery?"
409,00:25:12,00:25:14,"Flannery. Yeah, yeah."
410,00:25:14,00:25:16,He retired and moved back to L.A.
411,00:25:17,00:25:19,These are exit wounds from the husband's back.
412,00:25:19,00:25:20,What do you see?
413,00:25:22,00:25:24,It's shored.
414,00:25:25,00:25:26,There's a definite abrasion ring.
415,00:25:26,00:25:31,"The only way you get marks like these is when the vic's back is pressed against something-- a floor, a wall."
416,00:25:31,00:25:33,How did Flannery miss this?
417,00:25:33,00:25:39,"There are two CSIs you never want investigating your murder-- the one on his first week, and the one on his last."
418,00:25:43,00:25:45,"Hey, does Melissa know you're doing this?"
419,00:25:45,00:25:48,I don't want to get her hopes up.
420,00:25:48,00:25:49,She's been through a lot.
421,00:25:49,00:25:50,You know how some victims are.
422,00:25:50,00:25:52,They don't really want to know what happened.
423,00:25:52,00:25:54,You know?
424,00:25:58,00:26:00,(pager beeping)
425,00:26:00,00:26:01,You got something?
426,00:26:01,00:26:03,"Well, why else would I be paging you?"
427,00:26:03,00:26:09,A bullet shot from the same gun that was recovered from a liquor store robbery in Henderson six months ago.
428,00:26:09,00:26:11,Check it out.
429,00:26:11,00:26:14,They line up perfectly.
430,00:26:15,00:26:16,Cops recover the gun?
431,00:26:16,00:26:17,Do you one better?
432,00:26:19,00:26:20,They got the shooter.
433,00:26:20,00:26:21,Roger Wilder.
434,00:26:21,00:26:24,I'm liking you already.
435,00:26:25,00:26:28,I don't know any Melissa Winters.
436,00:26:28,00:26:29,"Oh, bad memory?"
437,00:26:29,00:26:30,Let me jog it for you.
438,00:26:30,00:26:33,She was the Assistant DA who prosecuted you for assault five years ago.
439,00:26:33,00:26:35,She got you sentenced to four years.
440,00:26:35,00:26:36,"Yeah, I was out in one."
441,00:26:37,00:26:38,What about her?
442,00:26:38,00:26:44,"Well, the trial transcript says at the sentencing you yelled at her, ""What goes around, comes around.""?"
443,00:26:44,00:26:45,It was a chump charge.
444,00:26:45,00:26:47,She did a number on me.
445,00:26:47,00:26:53,"So was it just a coincidence that three weeks after you got out of jail, Mrs. Winters and her husband were shot in her own home?"
446,00:26:55,00:26:57,We recently recovered a bullet from Melissa's head.
447,00:26:58,00:27:02,It happens to match a bullet fired from the gun that you used in your latest felony.
448,00:27:02,00:27:03,You know what we call that?
449,00:27:04,00:27:05,Corroborating evidence.
450,00:27:07,00:27:10,"I guess I'd keep my mouth shut, too."
451,00:27:10,00:27:11,Three years have passed.
452,00:27:11,00:27:15,"You don't have to say anything, but I have to tell you that evidence persists."
453,00:27:15,00:27:19,"A fingerprint, a fiber, a hair."
454,00:27:19,00:27:29,"If I find one shred of physical evidence that places you in the Winters' house, there is not a jury in Clark County that will not give you the death penalty."
455,00:27:32,00:27:33,I went to her house.
456,00:27:33,00:27:35,Not to kill her.
457,00:27:35,00:27:39,I wanted to see the look on her smug-ass face when she saw I knew where she lived.
458,00:27:39,00:27:41,"She wasn't there, all right?"
459,00:27:41,00:27:43,Did you knock or did you use the doorbell?
460,00:27:43,00:27:45,No one was there.
461,00:27:45,00:27:48,"I busted in, thought I'd mess the place up and give her a nice welcome home."
462,00:28:02,00:28:04,A gun just fell from a table.
463,00:28:04,00:28:06,Yep.
464,00:28:08,00:28:10,At least I got something out of her.
465,00:28:14,00:28:18,"Everybody tells you to get more involved in the community, but once you do..."
466,00:28:18,00:28:20,"Hey, hey, hey, you busted a man's lip."
467,00:28:20,00:28:22,"You broke a tooth, you sprained his finger."
468,00:28:22,00:28:23,"Jujitsu, Shotokan."
469,00:28:24,00:28:26,They act on their own.
470,00:28:26,00:28:27,I am just a vessel.
471,00:28:28,00:28:30,Shouldn't I go to the hospital?
472,00:28:30,00:28:31,I was bleeding.
473,00:28:31,00:28:32,I just have a few questions.
474,00:28:32,00:28:34,"First off, what were you doing at those apartments?"
475,00:28:34,00:28:39,I was on my way home from spin class on my bike and then I saw him.
476,00:28:39,00:28:44,He was in those bushes around Jennifer's place and I guess I thought the guy'd be scary.
477,00:28:44,00:28:48,"You know, Night Stalker scary, but he was like a wet French fry."
478,00:28:48,00:28:49,IknewI could take him.
479,00:28:50,00:28:52,She was insane. She didn't even let me explain.
480,00:28:52,00:28:53,Tryme.
481,00:28:53,00:28:55,I was looking for an apartment.
482,00:28:55,00:28:57,I just got a raise and I need more space.
483,00:28:57,00:29:02,So you decide to start your search in the dead of night when there's a rapist on the loose.
484,00:29:02,00:29:03,I work days.
485,00:29:03,00:29:06,It was in the classifieds.
486,00:29:07,00:29:08,Oh.
487,00:29:08,00:29:10,"Besides, what, what's he going to do tome?"
488,00:29:10,00:29:12,"Well, Wendy did okay."
489,00:29:12,00:29:23,"Um, the problem I'm having is that those apartments there's always an availability so, um, kind of gives you a plausible excuse anytime, anywhere, doesn't it?"
490,00:29:23,00:29:24,"Oh, I like those shoes."
491,00:29:24,00:29:26,What size are you?
492,00:29:26,00:29:27,Eight and a half.
493,00:29:27,00:29:28,"Eight and a half, huh?"
494,00:29:28,00:29:30,Do you mind if I look at the soles?
495,00:29:40,00:29:41,You seem disappointed.
496,00:29:43,00:29:46,"Hey, how would you feel about allowing me to look at all your shoes from home?"
497,00:29:47,00:29:48,"I mean, it'd be strictly voluntary."
498,00:29:48,00:29:51,I don't know if I'd be comfortable with that.
499,00:29:51,00:29:56,"A young, white male living in a targeted neighborhood-- I'd think you might want to, you know, help rule yourself out."
500,00:29:56,00:29:58,I value my privacy.
501,00:29:58,00:30:00,Of course you do.
502,00:30:00,00:30:01,Am I free to go?
503,00:30:01,00:30:02,Yeah.
504,00:30:06,00:30:07,"Oh. Uh, Mr. Reed."
505,00:30:09,00:30:13,"If Wendy attacked you and you're innocent, I'd think you might want to file charges against her."
506,00:30:13,00:30:14,How come you didn't?
507,00:30:15,00:30:20,"Uh, no. I do. Want to. File charges, yeah."
508,00:30:20,00:30:22,You sure? I wouldn't want you to do anything you didn't believe.
509,00:30:22,00:30:24,"No, she assaulted me. I want to file."
510,00:30:25,00:30:26,We'll take a report.
511,00:30:30,00:30:35,"I want you to know once you sign that complaint, it becomes a binding legal document, all right?"
512,00:30:45,00:30:48,He's filing charges on me?
513,00:30:48,00:30:49,This is ridiculous.
514,00:30:49,00:30:50,Agreed.
515,00:30:50,00:30:52,May I please take that swab?
516,00:30:52,00:30:55,Thank you.
517,00:30:55,00:30:57,"I'm going to need that jacket, too."
518,00:30:57,00:30:59,"That's great, you know?"
519,00:30:59,00:31:03,The guy's out there raping women and I end up getting strip-searched by the police.
520,00:31:03,00:31:13,"Wendy, I can't discuss an ongoing case but what I can tell you is if we're going to get this guy, it'll be because of what you're giving us right now."
521,00:31:13,00:31:14,Really?
522,00:31:14,00:31:16,Really.
523,00:31:16,00:31:18,Okay.
524,00:32:02,00:32:05,Roger Wilder said he was inside Melissa's house which is true.
525,00:32:05,00:32:07,He described the exact layout of the room.
526,00:32:07,00:32:12,But he said he found the gun when he destroyed the coffee table and I have no evidence to disprove that.
527,00:32:13,00:32:14,"Well, go for logic."
528,00:32:14,00:32:18,Some guy breaks into the Winters' house shoots 'em both and leaves his gun behind?
529,00:32:18,00:32:20,Why?
530,00:32:20,00:32:22,I don't know.
531,00:32:22,00:32:26,"Well, if it was really there, how come CSI didn't find it?"
532,00:32:26,00:32:28,That's a very good question.
533,00:32:28,00:32:30,I knew something was off when we saw that shored wound.
534,00:32:31,00:32:32,It didn't match up with Melissa's account.
535,00:32:32,00:32:38,If her husband was standing up like Melissa said when he was shot blood would have dripped down from the entry wound to the belt buckle.
536,00:32:39,00:32:40,Yeah. Gravity only runs one way.
537,00:32:40,00:32:42,(gunshot)
538,00:32:47,00:32:50,This blood trail...
539,00:32:50,00:32:51,The only way it's going south...
540,00:32:54,00:32:57,He was laying down.
541,00:33:04,00:33:05,She lied.
542,00:33:08,00:33:09,Heya!
543,00:33:09,00:33:12,About the blood on kung fu lady's clothes.
544,00:33:12,00:33:14,"Greg, I don't want any other cases jumping mine."
545,00:33:14,00:33:15,This is priority.
546,00:33:15,00:33:16,If I had a dime...
547,00:33:16,00:33:19,"Anticipating that, I skipped dinner and ran the DNA through CODIS."
548,00:33:19,00:33:20,Mm.
549,00:33:20,00:33:25,"Turns out that your apartment hunter, that girly man, left his double helix behind at another crime scene."
550,00:33:28,00:33:33,"Unknown subject, five months ago breaking and entering, burglary."
551,00:33:33,00:33:36,They had nothing to compare it to at the time.
552,00:33:36,00:33:38,But we do now.
553,00:33:38,00:33:39,Mm-hmm.
554,00:33:47,00:33:49,(knocks)
555,00:33:52,00:33:54,"(hoarsely): Sara, hey."
556,00:33:54,00:33:55,Hey.
557,00:33:55,00:33:56,You did it.
558,00:33:56,00:34:00,Yeah. I beat the odds.
559,00:34:00,00:34:01,I got lucky.
560,00:34:01,00:34:02,Lucky and smart.
561,00:34:06,00:34:08,I reopened your case.
562,00:34:08,00:34:11,"Yeah, my doctor mentioned it."
563,00:34:11,00:34:13,He said that he gave you the bullet.
564,00:34:13,00:34:16,"I know what you did, Melissa."
565,00:34:16,00:34:21,I examined the evidence.
566,00:34:21,00:34:26,Your husband wasn't free-standing in front of the couch struggling with some stranger.
567,00:34:30,00:34:32,TV SPORTS ANNOUNCER: ...and the Wildcats hang on...
568,00:34:35,00:34:37,There was no stranger.
569,00:34:37,00:34:42,"He was, uh, asleep, wasn't he? On the couch?"
570,00:34:42,00:34:46,You're the one with the evidence.
571,00:34:46,00:34:56,You had a CSI who was about to retire who was predisposed to believe the testimony of an honest prosecutor like you.
572,00:34:58,00:35:01,"Especially since you got shot, too?"
573,00:35:09,00:35:11,(sobbing)
574,00:35:11,00:35:16,"See, he leaned up from a prone position."
575,00:35:18,00:35:19,(sobbing)
576,00:35:27,00:35:29,(hammer cocks)
577,00:35:30,00:35:32,(gun drops)
578,00:35:34,00:35:37,The directionality of the blood tells the story.
579,00:35:40,00:35:43,I didn't understand why I couldn't move my legs.
580,00:35:45,00:35:48,And you couldn't let anyone find that gun.
581,00:35:48,00:35:51,They would have tested your hands for GSR.
582,00:35:57,00:35:59,(gasping)
583,00:36:12,00:36:16,I thought I could go back.
584,00:36:16,00:36:17,That I could get rid of it.
585,00:36:17,00:36:19,Somebody else did that for you.
586,00:36:19,00:36:22,I almost had him arrested for a murder you committed.
587,00:36:22,00:36:38,"You would think that an attorney could come up with a great case against an abusive husband, but I was ashamed."
588,00:36:38,00:36:42,I didn't want people to know what he did to me.
589,00:36:42,00:36:48,"All your closing arguments, all your big talk about justice."
590,00:36:49,00:36:51,I fell for all of it.
591,00:36:51,00:36:55,I've always believed in justice.
592,00:36:55,00:36:57,I still do.
593,00:37:01,00:37:03,"You never expected to live, did you?"
594,00:37:03,00:37:06,No.
595,00:37:08,00:37:13,"Out of all the CSIs, I knew I could depend on you."
596,00:37:20,00:37:23,I guess I'll be seeing you in court.
597,00:37:27,00:37:29,"Good-bye, Melissa."
598,00:37:58,00:38:00,How's your chart of escalation?
599,00:38:00,00:38:01,Deescalating.
600,00:38:01,00:38:08,"I had figured Taylor Reed was branching out, widening his circle, but after last night, I think he's pulling in, going back to his original comfort zone."
601,00:38:08,00:38:13,Was one of your original burglaries located at 13200 Appian Way?
602,00:38:21,00:38:23,Five months ago.
603,00:38:23,00:38:25,"First floor, broke in through a sliding door."
604,00:38:25,00:38:30,Where our guy Taylor Reed cut himself on the glass.
605,00:38:30,00:38:34,"So, we've narrowed the epicenter down to a single block-- Appian Way."
606,00:38:34,00:38:41,I'm thinking if we find something overlooked at those early crime scenes on Appian we can tie it to our sexual assaults.
607,00:38:41,00:38:42,Deescalation.
608,00:38:42,00:38:45,"If we can't get to where he's going, we'll go where he's been."
609,00:38:45,00:38:48,"Hi. Hi, I'm Nick Stokes."
610,00:38:48,00:38:49,I'm with the Vegas crime lab.
611,00:38:50,00:38:53,There's a situation in your apartment complex you should be aware of.
612,00:38:53,00:38:55,"You mind if I come in, ask you a few questions?"
613,00:38:55,00:38:57,Hello.
614,00:38:57,00:38:58,I'm Warrick Brown.
615,00:38:58,00:38:59,I'm from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
616,00:38:59,00:39:02,We're investigating a disturbance a couple doors down.
617,00:39:02,00:39:04,I wanted to ask you a few questions if I could.
618,00:39:04,00:39:05,So help me out.
619,00:39:05,00:39:08,What's a delicate way to say this?
620,00:39:08,00:39:13,"I'd like to barge in, tear your apartment upside down look for five-month-old evidence?"
621,00:39:13,00:39:14,You're the poet.
622,00:39:14,00:39:16,I'm glad you noticed.
623,00:39:16,00:39:18,Looks like somebody is still awake.
624,00:39:18,00:39:20,(knocking)
625,00:39:23,00:39:24,Las Vegas Police...
626,00:39:25,00:39:28,Detective. Ma'am.
627,00:39:28,00:39:29,What are you doing here?
628,00:39:29,00:39:31,I live here.
629,00:39:31,00:39:34,This is not the address on your driver's license.
630,00:39:34,00:39:36,People move.
631,00:39:36,00:39:37,Right.
632,00:39:37,00:39:38,We'd like to come in.
633,00:39:38,00:39:39,Sure.
634,00:39:41,00:39:43,Pardon the mess.
635,00:39:54,00:39:56,I'm going to take a guess here.
636,00:39:56,00:40:01,This apartment came on the market five months ago.
637,00:40:01,00:40:06,"The old tenant was bothered by the breaking and entering, the bloodstain that you left behind."
638,00:40:08,00:40:12,"You moved into the apartment you committed your first crime in, didn't you?"
639,00:40:13,00:40:14,"Now you're ready to move again, huh?"
640,00:40:15,00:40:17,You weren't looking for another apartment.
641,00:40:17,00:40:20,You were looking for...
642,00:40:23,00:40:25,another victim.
643,00:40:27,00:40:30,"You got something to hide, Reed?"
644,00:40:32,00:40:33,Jim?
645,00:40:33,00:40:34,"Yeah, okay."
646,00:40:58,00:41:00,"Jim, we need an ambulance!"
647,00:41:04,00:41:05,"Miss, are you all right?"
648,00:41:05,00:41:07,It's over. It's over. It's okay.
649,00:41:24,00:41:29,The cop read Melissa her rights right there in the hospital room.
650,00:41:29,00:41:31,You think you know somebody.
651,00:41:33,00:41:35,I never think that.
652,00:41:35,00:41:37,Ever?
653,00:41:41,00:41:49,When I was a kid I was playing hide- and-seek one day and I found this plastic bag under my big brother's bed.
654,00:41:49,00:41:52,I thought it was a bag of dirt so I took it to my mom.
655,00:41:52,00:41:55,Turned out it was his bag of weed.
656,00:41:55,00:41:58,He was grounded for a year.
657,00:41:58,00:42:02,The best intentions are fraught with disappointment.
658,00:42:02,00:42:05,Emerson?
659,00:42:06,00:42:08,Grissom.
