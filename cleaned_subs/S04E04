0	00:00:41	00:00:42	Help!
1	00:00:42	00:00:44	I need help! Ma'am, you all right?
2	00:00:44	00:00:45	There's a baby inside the car!
3	00:00:45	00:00:48	Where are your keys? It's not my car.
4	00:00:48	00:00:49	Help!
5	00:00:49	00:00:50	Somebody help us! Get back!
6	00:00:50	00:00:51	Get back! Help!
7	00:01:12	00:01:14	Registration's not here.
8	00:01:14	00:01:17	Shopping plaza.
9	00:01:17	00:01:20	Mother can't be too far.
10	00:01:23	00:01:27	When are parents going to learn a car is not a baby-sitter?
11	00:01:28	00:01:31	108 degrees outside.
12	00:01:31	00:01:35	You want to document the inside temperature?
13	00:01:39	00:01:42	How many of these have we had this year?
14	00:01:42	00:01:45	I lost count after ten.
15	00:01:45	00:01:46	This one makes 12.
16	00:01:47	00:01:48	Hey, that's my car.
17	00:01:48	00:01:50	Look, what the hell is going on?
18	00:01:50	00:01:52	Hey, that's my car.
19	00:01:52	00:01:53	What are they doing?
20	00:01:53	00:01:56	Did somebody break in to my car?
21	00:01:56	00:01:58	I'm Detective Brass, Las Vegas Police.
22	00:01:58	00:01:59	Sir, do you have a son?
23	00:02:00	00:02:03	Oh, God! Joshua!
24	00:02:07	00:02:12	145 degrees inside the car.
25	00:02:55	00:02:57	There's a heat advisory in effect.
26	00:02:57	00:02:59	Young ones and old ones, say INSIDE.
27	00:03:00	00:03:03	Make sure you wear a hat, and drink plenty of liquids...
28	00:03:04	00:03:08	If it's not babies in cars, it's babies in swimming pools.
29	00:03:09	00:03:11	That time of year.
30	00:03:11	00:03:20	Body's fully rigid-- normally I'd say infant's been dead a couple of hours, but in this weather, it's possible the infant died no more than an hour ago.
31	00:03:22	00:03:23	I'm off for air, Catherine.
32	00:03:25	00:03:27	I brought a sheet.
33	00:03:27	00:03:32	All these lookie-loos, I think we'd better treat this like the baby's still alive.
34	00:03:51	00:03:52	Thanks.
35	00:04:23	00:04:27	I spotted her from my boat during a routine patrol.
36	00:04:27	00:04:29	Boot prints and drag marks.
37	00:04:29	00:04:31	Did you move her? Had to.
38	00:04:31	00:04:33	Didn't want her floating away.
39	00:04:37	00:04:40	Board shorts, aqua sock shoes.
40	00:04:40	00:04:41	Dressed for sport.
41	00:04:41	00:04:43	No sign of bloating.
42	00:04:43	00:04:45	Chances are she's been dead less than 24 hours.
43	00:04:45	00:04:51	Neck looks broken, her head's split, but there's no cone of foam.
44	00:04:51	00:04:53	No what?
45	00:04:53	00:04:57	Uh, we have air in our lungs-- add water, you get foam.
46	00:04:57	00:04:58	It means she didn't drown.
47	00:04:58	00:05:01	Well, apparently, it's not the only way to die out here.
48	00:05:08	00:05:13	I was supposed to drop Joshua off at daycare.
49	00:05:14	00:05:17	My wife usually brings him on her way to work.
50	00:05:21	00:05:23	It was a hectic morning.
51	00:05:23	00:05:26	My cell phone was going off.
52	00:05:26	00:05:28	Problems at the office.
53	00:05:28	00:05:31	Look, I don't care how much pressure we get from the financier.
54	00:05:31	00:05:33	Look... Oh, can you hold on a second?
55	00:05:33	00:05:34	I have anoth...
56	00:05:34	00:05:36	I'm sorry, I can't do this right now.
57	00:05:36	00:05:39	I'm driving. Look, hold all the calls, call my wife, tell her I'll be...
58	00:05:39	00:05:40	I'll be home late.
59	00:05:40	00:05:42	I forgot he was in the back seat.
60	00:05:42	00:05:44	How could you forget?
61	00:05:44	00:05:45	I'm not the one who drives him.
62	00:05:45	00:05:47	Vickie does that.
63	00:05:49	00:05:51	I was distracted.
64	00:05:51	00:05:53	My-my job consumes so much of my mind...
65	00:05:53	00:05:55	So, what kind of job you have that's so distracting?
66	00:05:55	00:05:59	I'm an agent for the gaming commission.
67	00:05:59	00:06:02	It's a 25-hour-a-day job, eight days a week.
68	00:06:02	00:06:03	Your wife work?
69	00:06:04	00:06:06	She works as much as me.
70	00:06:10	00:06:12	Joshua made it all worthwhile.
71	00:06:12	00:06:14	Where's your wife now?
72	00:06:14	00:06:17	She's in L.A. on business.
73	00:06:20	00:06:22	What am I going to tell her?
74	00:06:38	00:06:41	We need something.
75	00:06:46	00:06:50	No birthmark, no scars, no tattoos.
76	00:07:01	00:07:03	It's a locker key.
77	00:07:04	00:07:06	You put in for the promotion, huh?
78	00:07:06	00:07:08	Yeah. Yeah, last week.
79	00:07:08	00:07:09	I still haven't heard anything about it.
80	00:07:10	00:07:11	Yeah, neither have I.
81	00:07:11	00:07:13	Hey, you ready for me?
82	00:07:13	00:07:15	She's all yours.
83	00:07:15	00:07:18	Heard you had a rough morning.
84	00:07:18	00:07:20	I've had better.
85	00:07:38	00:07:41	Sara, take a look at this.
86	00:07:41	00:07:44	What is that?
87	00:07:45	00:07:46	I don't know.
88	00:07:50	00:07:53	You were right about your dead swimmer.
89	00:07:53	00:07:54	She didn't drown.
90	00:07:54	00:07:59	Cause of death was a palpable fracture of the neck From the blow to the head.
91	00:07:59	00:08:00	Probably.
92	00:08:00	00:08:02	Cerebral contusion's beneath the skull fracture.
93	00:08:02	00:08:03	Savage hit.
94	00:08:04	00:08:05	Greg processed the sexual assault kit.
95	00:08:06	00:08:07	Positive for semen.
96	00:08:07	00:08:09	There were no physical findings for rape.
97	00:08:09	00:08:10	Not a lot to go on here.
98	00:08:10	00:08:16	Gastric lumen contained dark, pasty material-- maybe slightly digested meat, stringy vegetable matter.
99	00:08:16	00:08:17	Does it give us a timeline?
100	00:08:17	00:08:23	Emptying rates vary from person to person, but I'd estimate she ate two to four hours before death.
101	00:08:23	00:08:24	All right, good.
102	00:08:24	00:08:27	Ranger Stone came through-- found our locker.
103	00:08:29	00:08:31	Ms. Willows, uh, Chief Deputy D.A.
104	00:08:31	00:08:33	Jeffrey Sinclair. Mm-hmm.
105	00:08:33	00:08:35	Personal visit-- must be important. It is.
106	00:08:35	00:08:38	Joshua Winston, the dead infant? We're working on it.
107	00:08:38	00:08:40	How long was the baby left inside the car?
108	00:08:40	00:08:44	Based on the time of death, we estimate roughly an hour.
109	00:08:44	00:08:46	30 in the morning.
110	00:08:46	00:08:51	Okay, and what time does Paul Winston start work?
111	00:08:51	00:08:53	00 a.m.
112	00:08:53	00:08:55	Hour and a half.
113	00:08:55	00:09:03	Come on, look, I've got a three-year-old at home, and I've left him inside a covered garage with groceries for two minutes, tops, but two hours, in this heat?
114	00:09:03	00:09:04	I know. It's a tragedy.
115	00:09:05	00:09:08	You know, cases like these almost never see the inside of a courtroom.
116	00:09:08	00:09:10	This one will.
117	00:09:10	00:09:12	Is there any worse punishment than losing your child?
118	00:09:12	00:09:14	Yeah. Jail time.
119	00:09:15	00:09:21	I want him behind bars, so the next time a parent steps away from their vehicle in triple-degree heat, they check the back seat before they lock the door.
120	00:09:21	00:09:24	Doesn't change my job.
121	00:09:24	00:09:29	Look... I-I need you guys to thoroughly document this case.
122	00:09:29	00:09:36	I don't want any more surprises in court, so from the car to the kid, just try to cross your T's and dot your I's, okay?
123	00:09:36	00:09:40	I always do.
124	00:09:41	00:09:43	Car seat's fastened correctly.
125	00:09:43	00:09:45	Most aren't.
126	00:09:53	00:09:55	Hey, Gil.
127	00:09:55	00:09:58	Look at this. What do you see?
128	00:09:58	00:09:59	Um...
129	00:10:01	00:10:02	Nothing.
130	00:10:02	00:10:03	Exactly.
131	00:10:03	00:10:05	There's no indentations in the leather.
132	00:10:05	00:10:08	Well, maybe this wasn't the primary vehicle for transporting the baby.
133	00:10:09	00:10:09	Yeah.
134	00:10:10	00:10:11	Same thing the father said.
135	00:10:11	00:10:13	What is that?
136	00:10:14	00:10:16	Oh.
137	00:10:30	00:10:33	Negative for blood.
138	00:10:35	00:10:37	What are you thinking?
139	00:10:37	00:10:41	I don't get people.
140	00:10:46	00:10:48	...reporting a record number of heat-stroke victims.
141	00:10:48	00:10:50	Please be advised to drink plenty of fluids...
142	00:10:54	00:10:56	You with me?
143	00:10:56	00:10:58	I am now.
144	00:10:58	00:11:01	Catherine's doing the baby case.
145	00:11:02	00:11:04	It's hot in here.
146	00:11:04	00:11:05	Hell, yeah.
147	00:11:08	00:11:10	Super came in to the check the A.C.
148	00:11:10	00:11:11	and he found him like this.
149	00:11:11	00:11:14	Wesley Jones. 33.
150	00:11:14	00:11:15	In his massage chair.
151	00:11:15	00:11:19	No signs of forced entry.
152	00:11:19	00:11:22	It doesn't appear that robbery was a motive.
153	00:11:25	00:11:31	A small bruise on his fingertip, but no outward signs of trauma.
154	00:11:31	00:11:34	I had a case once where a soda can was the murder weapon.
155	00:11:34	00:11:38	Suspect used it to bash in the victim's head.
156	00:11:45	00:11:49	Diet shake, fitness magazine, cookie crumbs on the baking sheet.
157	00:11:49	00:11:53	This guy trying to start a diet or falling off of one.
158	00:11:53	00:11:54	He's got a workout schedule.
159	00:11:54	00:11:56	And today...
160	00:11:57	00:11:58	a three-mile run.
161	00:11:58	00:11:59	Whew.
162	00:12:02	00:12:06	Fat metabolizers, containing ephedra.
163	00:12:06	00:12:10	Scorching heat and ephedra-- that's not good.
164	00:12:25	00:12:26	Sounds like a heat stroke to me.
165	00:12:27	00:12:29	Yeah. Feel the burn.
166	00:12:32	00:12:34	Hey, Greg. Hey.
167	00:12:34	00:12:35	How we doing on that swab?
168	00:12:35	00:12:37	It should be ready any minute.
169	00:12:37	00:12:38	Another baby.
170	00:12:38	00:12:41	Hear the D.A.'s really gunning for the father.
171	00:12:41	00:12:43	What do you think they're going to charge him with? Murder?
172	00:12:43	00:12:48	Not likely. Child endangerment, child... neglect, child abuse.
173	00:12:48	00:12:50	Sounds like a slap on the wrist to me.
174	00:12:50	00:12:53	You and the D.A. can shake hands.
175	00:12:54	00:12:57	Your printout's ready.
176	00:13:00	00:13:02	The red stain in the car...
177	00:13:02	00:13:04	Brompheniramine maleates.
178	00:13:04	00:13:05	USP-one.
179	00:13:05	00:13:08	Cough syrup.
180	00:13:19	00:13:20	Dollar slots?
181	00:13:21	00:13:25	Is there truly no place left in Las Vegas without slot machines?
182	00:13:29	00:13:32	University student I.D. Sophia Renatta.
183	00:13:32	00:13:34	20 years old.
184	00:13:34	00:13:36	A guy's wallet?
185	00:13:36	00:13:40	No credit card. No driver's license.
186	00:13:41	00:13:43	Well, this is too big for Sophia.
187	00:13:43	00:13:44	It's a double extra large.
188	00:13:44	00:13:46	Well, that's definitely a guy's.
189	00:13:46	00:13:48	Cold be a boyfriend or beach buddy.
190	00:13:48	00:13:50	Suspect?
191	00:13:50	00:13:51	Yeah. I remember her...
192	00:13:51	00:13:54	and her punk in shinning armor.
193	00:13:54	00:13:55	He wasn't a cool guy?
194	00:13:55	00:13:57	The dude stiffed me, twice, bro.
195	00:13:57	00:14:00	Rents my Waverunner, doesn't bring it back.
196	00:14:00	00:14:03	And his cheap-ass plastic's got a 2-K limit.
197	00:14:03	00:14:05	Ouch.
198	00:14:05	00:14:06	Did they look like a couple to you?
199	00:14:06	00:14:08	She was a pretty girl with a problem.
200	00:14:08	00:14:10	He knew an in when he saw one.
201	00:14:10	00:14:11	You got a credit card?
202	00:14:11	00:14:13	No, this is all I have.
203	00:14:13	00:14:14	No, why don't you ask dad. We got a line here.
204	00:14:14	00:14:15	Why don't you step aside.
205	00:14:15	00:14:17	Maybe, maybe I can help.
206	00:14:21	00:14:23	So you think they just met?
207	00:14:23	00:14:24	It's a hot day...
208	00:14:24	00:14:25	something must've been in the air.
209	00:14:25	00:14:27	We'll need to look at your rental log if you don't mind.
210	00:14:27	00:14:29	Go crazy. Thanks.
211	00:14:29	00:14:31	Thanks.
212	00:14:33	00:14:34	Here it is. Mark Young.
213	00:14:35	00:14:37	45.
214	00:14:37	00:14:40	15.
215	00:14:40	00:14:44	Well, if he did just meet her, he's a pretty smooth operator.
216	00:14:44	00:14:48	Bailed her out, bought her lunch, and still had some coins left over to play the slots.
217	00:14:48	00:14:50	Classic lake date.
218	00:14:54	00:14:56	Boy meets girl...
219	00:14:56	00:14:57	girl ends up dead.
220	00:15:02	00:15:04	Mrs. Winston?
221	00:15:04	00:15:06	I asked my husband to do one thing.
222	00:15:07	00:15:09	One thing.
223	00:15:09	00:15:11	I got up early.
224	00:15:11	00:15:14	I fed Joshua.
225	00:15:14	00:15:18	I got him changed, dressed.
226	00:15:18	00:15:23	All he had to do was drop him off.
227	00:15:23	00:15:27	You flew to Los Angeles, Mrs. Winston?
228	00:15:29	00:15:33	I had, uh, business in Anaheim.
229	00:15:33	00:15:34	I'm in horticulture.
230	00:15:34	00:15:38	My company is designing a garden for a new hotel.
231	00:15:38	00:15:40	How'd you get to the airport?
232	00:15:40	00:15:43	I drove my car.
233	00:15:43	00:15:45	I'm assuming you have a baby seat in your vehicle.
234	00:15:45	00:15:48	Of course.
235	00:15:48	00:15:49	It's the law.
236	00:15:49	00:15:50	I...
237	00:15:50	00:15:53	I put it in Paul's car before I left.
238	00:15:57	00:16:00	Mrs. Winston, did...
239	00:16:00	00:16:02	Joshua have a cold?
240	00:16:02	00:16:05	He had a slight cough.
241	00:16:05	00:16:09	There was a bug going around daycare.
242	00:16:09	00:16:11	Did you give him anything for it?
243	00:16:11	00:16:13	Cough syrup.
244	00:16:13	00:16:14	Last night.
245	00:16:14	00:16:16	How about this morning?
246	00:16:20	00:16:24	There's a rule in our house that only one parent medicates the child.
247	00:16:24	00:16:30	But I told Paul to go ahead and give it to Joshua if he was still coughing.
248	00:16:32	00:16:34	Why?
249	00:16:35	00:16:37	Thanks for coming in. We're all done.
250	00:16:37	00:16:39	Thank you.
251	00:16:54	00:16:56	Vicky... What is wrong with you?!
252	00:16:56	00:16:58	How could you leave him in the car?!
253	00:16:58	00:17:00	What is wrong with you?!
254	00:17:12	00:17:15	Mr. Young, your son was last seen with a young girl.
255	00:17:15	00:17:16	We know that he rented a Waverunner.
256	00:17:16	00:17:20	Now that young girl is in our morgue and we don't know where your son is.
257	00:17:20	00:17:22	I can't believe this is happening.
258	00:17:22	00:17:24	Mark has a job.
259	00:17:24	00:17:28	There's no reason for him to be on the lake during a work day.
260	00:17:28	00:17:30	We contacted Mark's manager at work.
261	00:17:30	00:17:31	He called in sick.
262	00:17:31	00:17:32	What are you saying?
263	00:17:32	00:17:34	That he killed this girl? What is this?!
264	00:17:34	00:17:36	No, no. No one's saying that.
265	00:17:37	00:17:37	We're just...
266	00:17:38	00:17:41	Mr. Young, when is the last time that you saw Mark?
267	00:17:41	00:17:42	Yesterday morning.
268	00:17:42	00:17:44	He came by, got something to eat and he left.
269	00:17:44	00:17:46	I mean, at this age, I can't keep track of him.
270	00:17:46	00:17:49	Hey, believe me, I understand.
271	00:17:49	00:17:50	I've been there.
272	00:17:50	00:17:54	Mr. Stokes, my son is not a criminal.
273	00:17:54	00:17:56	We're not saying he's a criminal.
274	00:17:56	00:18:00	All we're saying is your son had contact with the victim and now he's missing.
275	00:18:00	00:18:04	What we'd like to do is get a warrant to search your house.
276	00:18:04	00:18:05	A warrant?
277	00:18:05	00:18:06	But maybe we don't need one.
278	00:18:06	00:18:14	If we could just come by there and collect some of Mark's things, uh, we could get a DNA sample, exclude him as a suspect.
279	00:18:14	00:18:17	You can take whatever you want.
280	00:18:17	00:18:20	Mark didn't hurt that girl.
281	00:18:27	00:18:29	Go ahead, pinch him.
282	00:18:34	00:18:34	There's no tenting.
283	00:18:35	00:18:36	So he wasn't dehydrated.
284	00:18:36	00:18:37	No, heat stroke.
285	00:18:37	00:18:40	Vitreous urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal.
286	00:18:40	00:18:41	Same for sodium.
287	00:18:41	00:18:42	What about drugs?
288	00:18:42	00:18:44	Tox was negative.
289	00:18:44	00:18:46	Heart attack?
290	00:18:46	00:18:48	Organ was normal, under 400 grams.
291	00:18:48	00:18:50	Left ventricle less than 1.5 centimeters.
292	00:18:50	00:18:52	I've run out of questions.
293	00:18:52	00:18:55	Well, I would've missed this one if it weren't for you.
294	00:18:56	00:18:59	Oh, you sectioned off that fingertip bruise.
295	00:18:59	00:19:01	Look at the scope.
296	00:19:04	00:19:06	The skin cells look stressed out.
297	00:19:06	00:19:07	It's called nuclear streaming.
298	00:19:07	00:19:10	It occurs when an electric current passes through tissue.
299	00:19:10	00:19:12	He was electrocuted.
300	00:19:12	00:19:14	But how come there's no burn marks?
301	00:19:14	00:19:15	Low-power shock.
302	00:19:15	00:19:17	Uh, current crossed the heart.
303	00:19:17	00:19:20	No damage to the muscle, but havoc on the rhythm.
304	00:19:20	00:19:23	Ventricular fibrillation.
305	00:19:23	00:19:26	A precision clock becomes a bag of worms.
306	00:19:29	00:19:31	All it takes is a little current.
307	00:19:32	00:19:33	And a point of contact.
308	00:19:34	00:19:37	The substance on her hips is suntan lotion.
309	00:19:37	00:19:40	Waterproof, zinc oxide, high SPF.
310	00:19:40	00:19:42	Well, that's odd.
311	00:19:42	00:19:44	The victim had a deep, even tan.
312	00:19:44	00:19:46	We collected low SPF oil from the locker.
313	00:19:46	00:19:49	It's a simple transfer-- him to her.
314	00:19:51	00:19:54	What about the green substance in the head wound?
315	00:19:54	00:19:55	Mm.
316	00:19:57	00:20:00	Navicula, Hannaea, Achnanthes, Cymbella.
317	00:20:01	00:20:02	Algae.
318	00:20:02	00:20:04	Yeah, not the free-swimming kind.
319	00:20:04	00:20:05	These are epilithic diatoms.
320	00:20:06	00:20:07	Attached to rocks.
321	00:20:07	00:20:08	Girl's out at the lake.
322	00:20:08	00:20:11	She meets some random guy she knows nothing about and she goes off with him.
323	00:20:11	00:20:12	She places herself in a bad situation.
324	00:20:13	00:20:14	And bad things happen.
325	00:20:18	00:20:22	Sophia takes a header off the Waverunner.
326	00:20:22	00:20:26	This algae grows everywhere.
327	00:20:26	00:20:28	A Waverunner... point and throttle.
328	00:20:30	00:20:31	We have no idea where they went.
329	00:20:31	00:20:35	Heard you guys narrowed your search area to 44 square miles.
330	00:20:35	00:20:37	That could take like months.
331	00:20:39	00:20:42	And I'm sure you're here to shed some light on the situation.
332	00:20:43	00:20:46	Your case is a boy-girl thing, right?
333	00:20:46	00:20:48	Right. Mm-hmm.
334	00:20:48	00:20:51	Body was washed up near Windmill Cove?
335	00:20:51	00:20:56	These two coves to the north-- Cotton Wood Island, Tequila-- huge make-out spots.
336	00:20:56	00:20:58	But nearly impossible to get to by land.
337	00:20:58	00:21:01	And how would you know that, Greg?
338	00:21:01	00:21:03	A gentleman never tells.
339	00:21:03	00:21:05	Anyway, I thought that would be a good place to start.
340	00:21:05	00:21:08	If you guys need an extra set of hands...
341	00:21:08	00:21:10	Uh, no. No. I think we got it, boss.
342	00:22:18	00:22:20	Howard Aston Winston.
343	00:22:28	00:22:30	Reporting the record number of...
344	00:22:30	00:22:32	still advises all citizens to stay hydrated and...
345	00:22:32	00:22:37	I got the state medical records for Howard Ashton Winston-- born August 12, 2000.
346	00:22:37	00:22:38	Would've been three years old.
347	00:22:38	00:22:39	When did he die?
348	00:22:40	00:22:42	Last year-- Tay-Sachs Disease.
349	00:22:42	00:22:43	Oh, that's incurable.
350	00:22:43	00:22:45	Like MS, right?
351	00:22:45	00:22:48	Yeah, I worked with a cop in New Jersey whose son died from it.
352	00:22:48	00:22:50	Aw, the poor kid went blind, couldn't swallow.
353	00:22:50	00:22:53	In the end, he couldn't even lift his head up.
354	00:22:53	00:22:56	The Winstons never mentioned they had another child.
355	00:22:56	00:22:58	Losing one kid is tough, but two?
356	00:22:58	00:23:00	I know it.
357	00:23:02	00:23:05	These wires are all insulated.
358	00:23:05	00:23:07	No burn marks.
359	00:23:07	00:23:10	Current didn't pass through this chair.
360	00:23:10	00:23:11	Whoa-ho!
361	00:23:11	00:23:13	What you got?
362	00:23:13	00:23:15	Ultimate power.
363	00:23:15	00:23:18	I could program this bad boy to make me a cup of coffee.
364	00:23:18	00:23:21	Is there any sign of electrical surging?
365	00:23:21	00:23:25	Well... this remote control's got plenty of juice, but...
366	00:23:25	00:23:26	the board's clean, no scoring.
367	00:23:27	00:23:32	You know, if I had my choice about how I was going to go out, it would not be electrocution.
368	00:23:32	00:23:37	I think an aneurysm in my sleep-- quick and painless.
369	00:23:37	00:23:39	I like surprises.
370	00:23:44	00:23:45	Bingo.
371	00:23:45	00:23:46	Look at that.
372	00:23:47	00:23:51	Current went through the phone.
373	00:23:51	00:23:53	From what? Heat lightning.
374	00:23:53	00:23:57	Storm rolls through the desert, sometimes it strikes in town.
375	00:24:12	00:24:14	Electrocution through the phone line?
376	00:24:14	00:24:16	I thought that was a myth.
377	00:24:16	00:24:17	This look like a myth to you?
378	00:24:26	00:24:28	Nice call, Greg.
379	00:24:28	00:24:30	There's our Waverunner.
380	00:24:41	00:24:43	Signs of sex; no sign of blood.
381	00:24:43	00:24:45	Half a tank of gas.
382	00:24:45	00:24:48	Why didn't he just take this to get out of Dodge?
383	00:24:48	00:24:54	Well, if he leaves the dock with Sophia, comes back alone... somebody might notice.
384	00:24:54	00:24:56	So...
385	00:24:56	00:24:58	he just hoofs it out of here?
386	00:24:58	00:24:59	How?
387	00:24:59	00:25:03	There's an access route about two miles east, but in this heat, no way.
388	00:25:07	00:25:09	Well, if you kill somebody...
389	00:25:09	00:25:11	you find a way.
390	00:25:11	00:25:13	Check it out.
391	00:25:23	00:25:26	Strike map from the National Lightning Detection Network.
392	00:25:27	00:25:30	This is Vegas in yellow.
393	00:25:36	00:25:39	Hasn't had a lightning strike in three days.
394	00:25:39	00:25:41	You got another theory?
395	00:25:41	00:25:45	All I got is a fried phone.
396	00:25:45	00:25:52	One point on the electrical path to ground.
397	00:25:52	00:25:57	If the phone wasn't the way in, maybe it was the way out.
398	00:25:57	00:25:59	You good on your end?
399	00:25:59	00:26:00	Yeah, fine.
400	00:26:00	00:26:02	All right. That's good.
401	00:26:02	00:26:04	Good. This about it?
402	00:26:04	00:26:06	Yeah.
403	00:26:06	00:26:10	Okay... now, electricity is fickle, right?
404	00:26:10	00:26:11	Yeah.
405	00:26:11	00:26:16	One centimeter can mean the difference between a little zap and dead.
406	00:26:16	00:26:21	So, let's assume that the current went out through his right index finger and the phone.
407	00:26:21	00:26:24	For it to cross his heart, it must've come from the left side of his body, right?
408	00:26:24	00:26:26	We've ruled out the fan and the chair.
409	00:26:26	00:26:29	Can was in his left hand, so...
410	00:26:29	00:26:33	the point of entry must've been somewhere else on his body.
411	00:26:41	00:26:44	His bare foot touched the floor.
412	00:27:01	00:27:03	Path of least resistance.
413	00:27:19	00:27:22	That's got to be a 50-foot drop.
414	00:27:22	00:27:25	Yeah, but when you're young, it just looks like a whole lot of fun.
415	00:27:25	00:27:26	Not for Sophia.
416	00:27:27	00:27:29	Come on, go for it.
417	00:27:29	00:27:30	No, I don't... It'll be a rush.
418	00:27:30	00:27:31	I don't know. ( screams )
419	00:27:36	00:27:38	Well, if that's where she died...
420	00:27:38	00:27:43	the evidence isn't up here.
421	00:27:43	00:27:46	It's down there.
422	00:28:05	00:28:07	Catherine...
423	00:28:07	00:28:08	Hey, I got your results.
424	00:28:08	00:28:14	Found a therapeutic level of cough syrup in the baby's system, no more than the recommended dosage.
425	00:28:14	00:28:23	So, between the cough syrup and the heat, Joshua probably fell asleep and the father forgot that he was there.
426	00:28:23	00:28:24	Maybe.
427	00:28:24	00:28:30	I also found organophosphates, more specifically Disulfoton.
428	00:28:34	00:28:36	Pesticides.
429	00:28:40	00:28:43	What the hell's he doing with pesticides in his system?
430	00:28:56	00:29:00	Mrs. Winston, we have a warrant to search the premises.
431	00:29:00	00:29:03	Where do you keep your gardening supplies?
432	00:29:20	00:29:21	Spiral search pattern.
433	00:29:21	00:29:23	The anchor chain is your center point.
434	00:29:23	00:29:24	Do a 360, then drop your depth.
435	00:29:24	00:29:27	Now, you're not done till you hit the bottom, okay?
436	00:29:27	00:29:30	You're looking for anything she might've hit her head on, probably something covered with algae.
437	00:29:30	00:29:32	Good luck.
438	00:30:06	00:30:09	What do you got?
439	00:30:09	00:30:11	That's got to be Mark Young.
440	00:30:14	00:30:16	Yeah.
441	00:30:22	00:30:26	Mr. and Mrs. Winston, why don't we get out of this heat?
442	00:30:34	00:30:37	Why didn't you tell us you had another child who also died?
443	00:30:37	00:30:41	How dare you bring up Howard.
444	00:30:41	00:30:42	I'm a mother in mourning.
445	00:30:42	00:30:44	I've already buried one child.
446	00:30:44	00:30:46	I have to bury another.
447	00:30:46	00:30:50	One was in God's hands, the other in the incapablehands of my husband.
448	00:30:50	00:30:51	Show some compassion.
449	00:30:52	00:30:53	I'm not the guilty one here!
450	00:30:53	00:30:55	I'm guilty.
451	00:30:55	00:30:58	I'm not a bad parent; I was negligent.
452	00:30:58	00:31:03	I take full responsibility for what I did, but leave Howard out of it.
453	00:31:03	00:31:07	We found pesticides in Joshua's bloodstream.
454	00:31:07	00:31:10	I'm going to have to get a court order and exhume the body of your first child.
455	00:31:12	00:31:17	Vicky and I went through hell watching Howard deteriorate.
456	00:31:17	00:31:20	Can't you let my boy rest in peace?
457	00:31:20	00:31:23	I'm afraid not.
458	00:31:28	00:31:33	With exhumations, you always hope for a good embalmer, and I think we've got one.
459	00:31:33	00:31:36	Body's well-preserved.
460	00:31:36	00:31:38	Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder.
461	00:31:38	00:31:41	You see the retarded musculature?
462	00:31:41	00:31:43	Classic symptom.
463	00:31:43	00:31:46	Night and day, compared to Joshua.
464	00:32:09	00:32:11	Quite a lot of Vitreous Fluid left.
465	00:32:11	00:32:14	I stand corrected-- great embalmer.
466	00:32:18	00:32:19	Run this?
467	00:33:23	00:33:26	No cough syrup. No pesticides.
468	00:33:26	00:33:28	Traces of monocycline.
469	00:33:28	00:33:30	Anti-inflammatory.
470	00:33:30	00:33:34	Sometimes prescribed for Tay-Sachs.
471	00:33:34	00:33:41	Well, it's the same principle of giving marijuana to glaucoma patients-- doesn't really cure the vision problems; it just buys you time.
472	00:33:41	00:33:42	Band-Aid.
473	00:33:42	00:33:43	Yeah.
474	00:33:43	00:33:46	Maybe the Winstons didn't want Howard to suffer.
475	00:33:46	00:33:49	So, they don't kill their first child, who's dying.
476	00:33:49	00:33:52	Why kill the second child, who's healthy?
477	00:33:58	00:34:02	So both Howard and Joshua Winston were patients of yours?
478	00:34:02	00:34:05	Yes. I was with them when Howard died.
479	00:34:05	00:34:07	That was a dark time for them.
480	00:34:07	00:34:10	And, I must say, it took a lot of courage for them to try again.
481	00:34:10	00:34:16	And since both parents carry the Tay-Sachs allele, there was a 25% that the second child would be born with it.
482	00:34:16	00:34:20	But Joshua dodged the bullet.
483	00:34:20	00:34:24	We tested Vicki early in the second trimester; the results came back negative.
484	00:34:26	00:34:28	Had you seen Joshua recently?
485	00:34:28	00:34:30	A couple days before he died.
486	00:34:30	00:34:32	It was a regular checkup, or...?
487	00:34:32	00:34:36	No. Vicki called in a panic, said something was wrong.
488	00:34:36	00:34:38	I told her to bring him right in.
489	00:34:38	00:34:43	And despite the fetal test, Joshua seemed to be exhibiting all the classic signs of early Tay-Sachs.
490	00:34:43	00:34:47	Floppiness, poor head control, unable to turn over, decreased muscle tone.
491	00:34:47	00:34:50	When they brought him in it was Howard all over again.
492	00:34:50	00:34:53	The only conclusion was that the fetal test was a false negative.
493	00:34:54	00:34:56	What are the odds?
494	00:34:56	00:34:57	Under one percent.
495	00:34:57	00:35:01	When I saw Joshua's retinas there were red spots-- classic Tay-Sachs.
496	00:35:01	00:35:03	I sent out an enzyme test to confirm it.
497	00:35:03	00:35:05	And did you confirm it?
498	00:35:05	00:35:07	Results haven't come back yet.
499	00:35:09	00:35:11	Mark Young.
500	00:35:11	00:35:15	Cause of death is asphyxia due to fresh water drowning.
501	00:35:15	00:35:17	No bruises or other injuries.
502	00:35:17	00:35:21	Except for a ruptured tympanic membrane.
503	00:35:21	00:35:22	Hmm.
504	00:35:25	00:35:27	Hmm.
505	00:35:29	00:35:30	Tear's red.
506	00:35:30	00:35:31	It's ragged.
507	00:35:32	00:35:33	Ante-mortem injury.
508	00:35:33	00:35:36	In water, burst eardrums typically result from rapid decent.
509	00:35:36	00:35:39	Sudden changes in pressure without equalizing.
510	00:35:39	00:35:41	She went in first.
511	00:35:47	00:35:49	Whoo-hoo!
512	00:35:51	00:35:54	And he jumped in after her.
513	00:36:28	00:36:30	This was an accident, Sara.
514	00:36:31	00:36:33	He was trying to save her.
515	00:36:33	00:36:34	That's a great theory.
516	00:36:34	00:36:35	But we can't prove that.
517	00:36:35	00:36:37	26 feet under with a busted eardrum?
518	00:36:37	00:36:39	If not to save her, why dive that deep?
519	00:36:39	00:36:40	I don't know.
520	00:36:42	00:36:44	Case is over.
521	00:36:45	00:36:46	Almost over.
522	00:36:46	00:36:55	Found this mineral residue that led all the way from the massage chair to this burnt-out power strip across the room... water stain.
523	00:36:55	00:36:57	Well, there's your conductor.
524	00:36:57	00:37:02	I also found them on the cookie sheet and this water-damaged magazine right here.
525	00:37:02	00:37:07	And I found this plastic bag in the kitchen garbage.
526	00:37:09	00:37:11	Ice Block.
527	00:37:12	00:37:15	Add that with the fan, you got yourself a homemade swamp cooler.
528	00:37:41	00:37:43	Inventive.
529	00:37:43	00:37:45	Guy was just trying to stay cool.
530	00:37:52	00:37:53	Thanks.
531	00:37:53	00:37:56	No, it's my pleasure.
532	00:38:00	00:38:01	Hey, Nick.
533	00:38:01	00:38:02	Hey.
534	00:38:02	00:38:03	What are you doing?
535	00:38:03	00:38:05	What do you mean?
536	00:38:05	00:38:07	What did you tell him?
537	00:38:07	00:38:08	His son died a hero?
538	00:38:08	00:38:11	Look, I'm just trying to give the guy a little peace, you know?
539	00:38:11	00:38:14	Oh, well, who are you trying to help feel better, him or you?
540	00:38:16	00:38:20	you're Mr. Young, would you rather know this much or nothing at all?
541	00:38:20	00:38:25	You know, if the evidence doesn't support the answer, a CSI shouldn't be asking that question.
542	00:38:26	00:38:27	Well, okay, if that works for you.
543	00:38:27	00:38:29	Be careful.
544	00:38:50	00:38:52	I was in the garden this weekend.
545	00:38:52	00:38:55	Why are you so interested in everything we do?
546	00:38:55	00:38:58	I mean, when did our lives become an open book?
547	00:38:58	00:39:02	When your second son ended up dead.
548	00:39:02	00:39:05	When you were in the garden, was Joshua with you?
549	00:39:05	00:39:06	No.
550	00:39:06	00:39:08	Yes, he was.
551	00:39:08	00:39:09	We had a fight...
552	00:39:09	00:39:11	Vicky, it's your turn.
553	00:39:11	00:39:12	I've had him for the past four hours.
554	00:39:13	00:39:14	What, are you counting hours now?
555	00:39:14	00:39:16	He's your son.
556	00:39:16	00:39:18	Look, if you're not gardening here, then it's at work.
557	00:39:18	00:39:20	I've had him all day. It's your turn.
558	00:39:20	00:39:22	Here. Thank you.
559	00:39:22	00:39:24	See the pretty flowers, Joshua?
560	00:39:27	00:39:29	I guess he was.
561	00:39:29	00:39:32	But the moment he passed Joshua off to me I went inside.
562	00:39:32	00:39:34	Did you wash your hands?
563	00:39:34	00:39:37	Honestly, I don't remember.
564	00:39:37	00:39:39	I'm in the garden a lot, so I'm sure I washed my hands.
565	00:39:40	00:39:43	Well, I met with your pediatrician, Dr. Garner.
566	00:39:43	00:39:51	When you brought Joshua in on that emergency call, it was because you feared that he, too, had Tay-Sachs.
567	00:39:51	00:39:53	We had the test before he was born.
568	00:39:53	00:39:55	Dr. Garner said we were fine.
569	00:39:56	00:39:58	I can imagine for both of you it must have been like reliving the nightmare.
570	00:39:59	00:40:01	One child, now two.
571	00:40:02	00:40:12	Did you know that repeated exposure to certain pesticides, even in small amounts, can have an adverse effect in infants?
572	00:40:12	00:40:14	Even mimic the signs of Tay-Sachs?
573	00:40:14	00:40:16	The symptoms are similar.
574	00:40:16	00:40:19	Floppiness of the head, arching of the back.
575	00:40:19	00:40:20	Blindness...
576	00:40:20	00:40:23	inability to swallow. You know, like that.
577	00:40:23	00:40:27	You work with pesticides, Mrs. Winston, on your job and in your garden.
578	00:40:27	00:40:34	And you handled Joshua-- we suspect that that's how the traces got into his system.
579	00:40:34	00:40:42	I'm just speculating here, No, Paul. I went through hell with Howard, I can't go through that with Joshua.
580	00:40:43	00:40:44	We'll wait for the enzyme tests.
581	00:40:44	00:40:47	No. No more tests. No more drugs.
582	00:40:47	00:40:49	No more kids.
583	00:40:49	00:40:50	No more!
584	00:40:50	00:40:54	I can't live through that again, and neither can you.
585	00:40:58	00:41:03	You gave Joshua cough syrup, Mr. Winston.
586	00:41:03	00:41:05	Why did you medicate him?
587	00:41:05	00:41:10	'Cause, maybe, you just didn't want him to suffer?
588	00:41:39	00:41:46	You have no idea what it's like to watch your child die.
589	00:41:47	00:41:49	We couldn't go through that again.
590	00:41:51	00:41:55	The shame of it is you didn't have to.
591	00:41:57	00:42:01	The enzyme test that Dr. Garner ran came back negative.
592	00:42:03	00:42:06	Joshua didn't have Tay-Sachs.
593	00:42:09	00:42:12	You killed a perfectly healthy baby.
