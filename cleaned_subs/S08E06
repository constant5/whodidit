0	00:00:13	00:00:15	She-bang!
1	00:00:15	00:00:18	That's pretty cool, right?
2	00:00:18	00:00:19	Mm-hmm.
3	00:00:19	00:00:22	That doesn't happen very often, you know.
4	00:00:22	00:00:24	I know.
5	00:00:26	00:00:28	You won.
6	00:00:29	00:00:30	You beat me!
7	00:00:30	00:00:31	Uh-huh.
8	00:00:33	00:00:35	You want to play again?
9	00:00:39	00:00:41	Fine.
10	00:00:41	00:00:44	Whatever.
11	00:00:44	00:00:46	Knock yourself out.
12	00:01:28	00:01:30	Evan?
13	00:02:47	00:02:49	How long have you been here?
14	00:02:49	00:02:51	About six hours.
15	00:03:06	00:03:09	Why haven't these bodies been released?
16	00:03:09	00:03:11	Good question.
17	00:03:11	00:03:19	David was in Henderson on another call, so, when Greg and I got here, we just started processing the house.
18	00:03:19	00:03:20	Found the victim in the bathroom, covered with a towel.
19	00:03:21	00:03:23	We got a plastic print on the bathroom door.
20	00:03:23	00:03:33	It's the strongest piece of evidence-- I photographed it and transmitted the image back to the lab; Mandy got a hit to an unknown palm; case info was in ViCAP.
21	00:03:33	00:03:40	And then, Dispatch called, telling me to stop processing immediately, by order of the FBI.
22	00:03:40	00:03:42	The FBI field office is right next to the Strip.
23	00:03:42	00:03:44	What's taking them so long?
24	00:03:44	00:03:45	Oh, beats the hell out of me.
25	00:04:13	00:04:14	Jack Malone, FBI.
26	00:04:14	00:04:15	Jim Brass.
27	00:04:16	00:04:19	I'm based in New York, but I was testifying in a case in San Francisco.
28	00:04:19	00:04:23	When I heard about the ViCAP hit, I got here as fast as I could.
29	00:04:23	00:04:25	Chopper from the Strip? That's nice.
30	00:04:25	00:04:27	That's my tax dollars at work?
31	00:04:27	00:04:30	You get a positive ID on the boy?
32	00:04:30	00:04:33	No, but we have an ID on the female-- name is Carmen Davis.
33	00:04:33	00:04:34	According to neighbors, she lives alone.
34	00:04:34	00:04:35	Apparently no kids of her own.
35	00:04:35	00:04:39	But if I find anything out, I'll let you know. Thank you. You're up.
36	00:04:43	00:04:44	You-- you get enough photos?
37	00:04:44	00:04:46	Definitely.
38	00:04:46	00:04:48	Roll the body over.
39	00:05:01	00:05:03	What's going on?
40	00:05:05	00:05:07	Jack Malone, FBI, New York City.
41	00:05:09	00:05:13	This boy was kidnapped from his babysitter's apartment six years ago.
42	00:05:13	00:05:15	Babysitter was killed.
43	00:05:15	00:05:18	The only evidence at the crime scene was a bloody palm print.
44	00:05:18	00:05:21	Well, there may be a resemblance, but kids change a lot in six years.
45	00:05:21	00:05:23	Mm-hmm.
46	00:05:23	00:05:26	DNA will tell us if this is your kid.
47	00:05:26	00:05:29	But it does look like your killer came to Vegas.
48	00:05:34	00:05:37	and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
49	00:06:02	00:06:06	Based on lividity and rigor, TOD-- roughly 24 hours ago.
50	00:06:06	00:06:09	And he's got perimortem bruising on the back of the neck.
51	00:06:09	00:06:11	And a single sharp-force injury to the forehead.
52	00:06:17	00:06:19	Looks like he hit his head on the table.
53	00:06:19	00:06:21	Or somebody slammed it against the table.
54	00:06:21	00:06:22	Well, we don't know that yet.
55	00:06:25	00:06:29	Agent Malone, why don't I fill you in on what else we do know.
56	00:06:29	00:06:32	There are no signs anywhere that the boy actually lived here.
57	00:06:32	00:06:35	The sleeping bag on the couch indicates that he was probably a house guest.
58	00:06:35	00:06:38	Why don't you follow me into the kitchen.
59	00:06:39	00:06:41	Let me know when you're ready to transport the body.
60	00:06:41	00:06:43	Yes, sir.
61	00:07:02	00:07:04	Bring us up to speed, Greg.
62	00:07:04	00:07:06	Okay, sure. Um...
63	00:07:06	00:07:11	Carmen Davis's keys were still in her purse; the car's outside.
64	00:07:11	00:07:17	No cash in the wallet, and the credit cards have been removed and neatly stacked on the table; it appears as though they've been wiped clean.
65	00:07:17	00:07:21	The killer was smart enough not to take anything that could be traced.
66	00:07:21	00:07:23	Which suggests that he was an experienced criminal.
67	00:07:23	00:07:26	What do you know about this guy?
68	00:07:26	00:07:28	Including everything you just told me?
69	00:07:28	00:07:30	Everything you just told me.
70	00:07:30	00:07:34	Six years ago, the killer took the murder weapon with him.
71	00:07:34	00:07:38	It was a baseball bat that he found in the apartment.
72	00:07:38	00:07:40	Well, this time, we think it's a hammer.
73	00:07:42	00:07:47	The round indentation wounds are consistent with hammer blows.
74	00:07:47	00:07:51	Do you see any similarities between this victim and the babysitter who was killed six years ago?
75	00:07:51	00:07:53	Just that they were both bludgeoned to death.
76	00:07:53	00:07:56	The babysitter was a lot older, and she wasn't covered.
77	00:07:56	00:08:00	Covering a body usually indicates remorse on the part of the killer.
78	00:08:00	00:08:04	So you think he felt remorseful about this victim and not the one from six years ago?
79	00:08:04	00:08:06	Maybe he knew Carmen Davis.
80	00:08:06	00:08:11	There's three toothbrushes, two of them in travel cases.
81	00:08:13	00:08:15	the killer was staying here with the little boy.
82	00:08:15	00:08:18	There was no sign of forced entry.
83	00:08:18	00:08:19	Agent Malone?
84	00:08:19	00:08:21	We're ready to take the boy out.
85	00:08:21	00:08:22	Okay.
86	00:08:22	00:08:27	So, I assume we'll be sending over the case evidence to Quantico?
87	00:08:28	00:08:30	We can't process the evidence from every case we're involved in.
88	00:08:30	00:08:32	We have a massive overload already.
89	00:08:33	00:08:34	This will be joint jurisdiction.
90	00:08:34	00:08:38	You do your thing, I'll do mine.
91	00:08:46	00:08:49	COD is multiple blunt-force trauma.
92	00:08:49	00:09:00	Based on the development of the contusions, it appears the blow to the back of the skull was the first impact, but the ones on the face came about half-hour later.
93	00:09:00	00:09:01	Half an hour? Yeah.
94	00:09:01	00:09:02	Was she raped?
95	00:09:02	00:09:03	Yeah.
96	00:09:03	00:09:10	I, uh, did a wet mount, found semen in the vaginal vault, and I collected an SAE kit.
97	00:09:10	00:09:13	This guy is some piece of work.
98	00:09:13	00:09:16	I'll get it to DNA.
99	00:09:35	00:09:37	No birthmarks.
100	00:09:37	00:09:40	Our missing boy didn't have any, either.
101	00:09:40	00:09:42	So the only way to confirm the identity...
102	00:09:42	00:09:45	I've had the original DNA report electronically sent to your lab.
103	00:09:45	00:09:49	Well, then you'll just have to wait for your answer.
104	00:09:51	00:09:55	You know, maybe now would be a good time for you to brief us on the original case.
105	00:09:58	00:09:59	His name was Jason Taylor.
106	00:09:59	00:10:01	(glass breaking) He was at his babysitter's apartment.
107	00:10:01	00:10:03	He'd been home sick from school.
108	00:10:03	00:10:06	That's when it happened.
109	00:10:16	00:10:23	An unidentified male entered, most likely through an open window on the fire escape, murdered the babysitter and took Jason with him.
110	00:10:28	00:10:32	We never got a decent description of the perp.
111	00:10:32	00:10:33	Nothing was stolen?
112	00:10:33	00:10:37	Cash was still in the babysitter's purse; the only thing missing was a baseball bat.
113	00:10:37	00:10:41	Which, based on her wounds, you figure that was the murder weapon? Mm-hmm.
114	00:10:41	00:10:44	Baseball bat there, hammer here-- weapons of convenience.
115	00:10:44	00:10:46	Guy seems to grab whatever's handy.
116	00:10:46	00:10:47	And takes it with him.
117	00:10:47	00:10:49	Was the babysitter raped?
118	00:10:49	00:10:51	No.
119	00:10:51	00:10:55	Why kidnap a kid, wait six years, then kill him?
120	00:10:55	00:10:59	Most four year olds will do what you tell them.
121	00:10:59	00:11:02	Most ten year olds will do what they want.
122	00:11:02	00:11:05	Kid starts asking the wrong questions, talking to the wrong people...
123	00:11:05	00:11:07	Tons of possibilities.
124	00:11:07	00:11:09	Yes. Way too many.
125	00:11:09	00:11:12	According to this, the kid was adopted.
126	00:11:12	00:11:14	Did you take a look at the biological parents?
127	00:11:14	00:11:16	Jason was adopted as an infant.
128	00:11:16	00:11:18	There was no way we could track his records.
129	00:11:19	00:11:22	Adoptive parents had no contact with the kidnappers?
130	00:11:22	00:11:24	They were not given any ransom demands?
131	00:11:24	00:11:25	There was no motive.
132	00:11:26	00:11:28	I couldn't even give the parents a reason.
133	00:11:28	00:11:30	Maybe there isn't one.
134	00:11:30	00:11:34	Most children are abducted by somebody who's associated with the family.
135	00:11:34	00:11:38	Random kidnappings are extraordinarily rare.
136	00:11:38	00:11:42	Except in the U.S. last year, there were almost a hundred.
137	00:11:45	00:11:48	Some things are just random.
138	00:11:48	00:11:51	Have you ever tried telling that to the parents of a child who's been kidnapped?
139	00:11:51	00:11:54	Yes, actually, I have.
140	00:11:54	00:11:56	And how'd that work out for you?
141	00:12:13	00:12:15	Hey, guys.
142	00:12:15	00:12:18	Found an empty jewelry box in the bedroom.
143	00:12:18	00:12:22	Maybe the killer swiped the jewelry in addition to the cash.
144	00:12:22	00:12:24	Easy to fence in this neighborhood.
145	00:12:24	00:12:28	Was the dead girl wearing any jewelry when you found her?
146	00:12:28	00:12:34	Nope. Then that's a good call, man, 'cause she's wearing some in just about every one of these pictures.
147	00:12:34	00:12:36	I wouldn't doubt if she kept a lot of it in that box.
148	00:12:36	00:12:39	I'll check with the local pawn shops, see if anything's been hocked.
149	00:12:46	00:12:51	Hey, Greg, you see any books on the shelf over there on gambling or poker?
150	00:12:51	00:12:56	No, just a lot of romance novels, mysteries and women's health.
151	00:12:56	00:13:03	'Cause I got poker player stats, and multiple websites on online gambling.
152	00:13:03	00:13:06	Seems kind of out of place to be the victim's.
153	00:13:08	00:13:13	I think we got a mystery houseguest who is a card shark.
154	00:13:26	00:13:29	Welcome to our annual poker tournament.
155	00:13:29	00:13:37	The first of the elimination rounds are over and we're down to our last 100 players.
156	00:13:37	00:13:40	Good luck, everyone.
157	00:14:52	00:14:53	Got him!
158	00:15:20	00:15:21	You know what this is?
159	00:15:21	00:15:23	Huh?
160	00:15:23	00:15:25	This is police brutality.
161	00:15:25	00:15:26	Yeah, whatever.
162	00:15:29	00:15:31	We're not done yet.
163	00:15:31	00:15:35	Well, he doesn't look like much, but then again, they never do.
164	00:15:35	00:15:37	If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to him first.
165	00:15:37	00:15:39	You don't have to be polite, Jack.
166	00:15:39	00:15:42	This is a federal case, you don't need my permission.
167	00:15:46	00:15:49	How you going to go at him?
168	00:15:49	00:15:52	I don't know.
169	00:15:52	00:15:56	I usually just make it up as I go along.
170	00:16:02	00:16:04	All done here.
171	00:16:04	00:16:05	Thank you.
172	00:16:05	00:16:07	You can leave, too.
173	00:16:12	00:16:14	Mr. Michaels.
174	00:16:14	00:16:19	Jack Malone. FBI.
175	00:16:19	00:16:21	Huh.
176	00:16:21	00:16:23	FBI.
177	00:16:23	00:16:25	Mm-hmm.
178	00:16:26	00:16:28	Why'd you run back there?
179	00:16:28	00:16:30	Oh, I don't know. I was scared, I guess.
180	00:16:30	00:16:31	Of what?
181	00:16:32	00:16:34	Um... of getting caught.
182	00:16:34	00:16:36	Being embarrassed.
183	00:16:37	00:16:38	Right.
184	00:16:38	00:16:41	So it's probably a good idea not to do anything that would embarrass you.
185	00:16:42	00:16:43	Yeah, I know.
186	00:16:43	00:16:46	But you never really think you're going to get caught, do you?
187	00:16:46	00:16:49	Yeah, but you did.
188	00:16:49	00:16:52	You want to talk about it?
189	00:16:52	00:16:56	I got nowhere I have to be.
190	00:16:56	00:16:59	And you got nowhere to go.
191	00:17:06	00:17:09	I don't know what the big deal is.
192	00:17:09	00:17:11	I mean...
193	00:17:11	00:17:13	we've all thought about it, right?
194	00:17:13	00:17:17	Sure. It's natural.
195	00:17:17	00:17:18	Right.
196	00:17:18	00:17:20	I had a plan.
197	00:17:20	00:17:21	It was simple.
198	00:17:21	00:17:23	I take it...
199	00:17:24	00:17:26	I play with it for a little while...
200	00:17:26	00:17:28	It?
201	00:17:28	00:17:30	Like it's property?
202	00:17:30	00:17:32	Yeah, yeah, it's nothing personal.
203	00:17:32	00:17:35	I didn't even think Brother Willard would even miss it.
204	00:17:35	00:17:37	Brother Willard?
205	00:17:37	00:17:41	You want to talk to me about Brother Willard?
206	00:17:45	00:17:47	Brother Willard is my spiritual advisor.
207	00:17:47	00:17:50	He's supposed to talk me out of doing things like this.
208	00:17:50	00:17:52	But you know what? Sometimes I just...
209	00:17:52	00:17:55	I just feel like listening to that little voice inside my head.
210	00:17:55	00:17:58	Hmm.
211	00:17:58	00:18:02	Right.
212	00:18:06	00:18:11	And what is that little voice inside your head telling you right now?
213	00:18:11	00:18:15	Just take it.
214	00:18:18	00:18:20	Just take it.
215	00:18:20	00:18:24	This is not the first time that you've taken something that doesn't belong to you, is it?
216	00:18:24	00:18:26	What do you mean?
217	00:18:26	00:18:28	Six years ago, in New York City.
218	00:18:28	00:18:30	I don't know anything about New York.
219	00:18:30	00:18:33	Six years ago, in New York City, you took something that didn't belong to you.
220	00:18:33	00:18:34	I don't know anything about New York.
221	00:18:34	00:18:36	Look, I told you-- I was going to give it back.
222	00:18:36	00:18:37	Really, I just had some bad luck.
223	00:18:37	00:18:39	Is that what you call it?!
224	00:18:39	00:18:42	You abducted and murdered a four-year-old boy!
225	00:18:42	00:18:44	I don't know what you're talking about!
226	00:18:44	00:18:45	Just bad luck?!
227	00:18:45	00:18:46	Let him go.
228	00:18:46	00:18:51	Look, you want to rendition him to Gitmo, be my guest, but in this house, we play by the rules.
229	00:18:51	00:18:53	Now get your hand off the suspect.
230	00:19:02	00:19:03	What's that?
231	00:19:06	00:19:09	That's...
232	00:19:09	00:19:14	That's Evan. That's...
233	00:19:15	00:19:18	This is my son.
234	00:19:18	00:19:20	This is Evan.
235	00:19:52	00:19:55	Guy's not the murderer. I know.
236	00:19:55	00:19:57	We ran his palm print. Doesn't match.
237	00:19:57	00:20:00	He's a Mormon from Utah.
238	00:20:00	00:20:03	Stole $10,000 from the church, entry money into a poker game.
239	00:20:04	00:20:06	Figured he'd win the money, replaced it before they noticed.
240	00:20:06	00:20:08	And decided he'd bring his kid with him?
241	00:20:08	00:20:09	Single parent.
242	00:20:09	00:20:12	Carmen Davis is an ex-girlfriend.
243	00:20:12	00:20:14	Dropped the kid off with her.
244	00:20:14	00:20:17	And while he's playing cards, they both get murdered.
245	00:20:17	00:20:19	I got your DNA results.
246	00:20:19	00:20:22	The dead boy was confirmed as Tom Michael's son.
247	00:20:22	00:20:25	So he's definitely not your kidnap victim from New York.
248	00:20:25	00:20:30	However, the results of the SAE kit on the female victim showed two semen donors.
249	00:20:30	00:20:35	One was Tom and the other unknown, but that unknown was connected to two unsolved rape murders in CODIS.
250	00:20:35	00:20:36	Excuse me.
251	00:20:40	00:20:44	Two years ago in Wyoming, 11 months ago in Idaho.
252	00:20:44	00:20:47	Okay, one victim was 23, the other one 54.
253	00:20:47	00:20:48	One blonde, one brunette.
254	00:20:48	00:20:50	Both female.
255	00:20:50	00:20:51	Both with their faces covered.
256	00:20:51	00:20:54	Both single, with no kids.
257	00:20:54	00:20:56	Breaks the pattern.
258	00:20:56	00:20:57	If there is a pattern.
259	00:20:57	00:21:01	There's a big gap between Vegas and New York.
260	00:21:01	00:21:06	Now, this guy has been involved in four murders in the last two years.
261	00:21:06	00:21:08	There's got to be more.
262	00:21:08	00:21:12	Well, if there are, then there may not be any associated DNA in the system.
263	00:21:12	00:21:15	Small towns usually can't afford to run it if they don't have a suspect.
264	00:21:15	00:21:16	Doesn't mean there's not a pattern.
265	00:21:16	00:21:19	Just means we haven't found it yet.
266	00:21:30	00:21:31	Special Agent Malone.
267	00:21:31	00:21:33	David Hodges.
268	00:21:33	00:21:41	The granular powder that you found on the dead boy's neck and shirt was largely ammonium nitrates and sulfates-- commercial grade fertilizer.
269	00:21:42	00:21:45	Great, so the killer could be from any farm in the United States.
270	00:21:46	00:21:48	Yeah, or any backyard.
271	00:21:48	00:21:49	Thank you.
272	00:21:49	00:21:52	So, I was curious about opportunities at the federal level.
273	00:21:52	00:21:55	Pay scale, working conditions...
274	00:21:55	00:21:57	You want my honest opinion?
275	00:21:57	00:21:59	Absolutely.
276	00:21:59	00:22:02	There's a lot less competition in Vegas for a guy like you.
277	00:22:02	00:22:05	The FBI has enough ass-kissers already.
278	00:22:14	00:22:15	I'm looking for Tom Michaels.
279	00:22:15	00:22:17	Yeah, he's in there.
280	00:22:17	00:22:19	You might want to give him a minute, though.
281	00:22:19	00:22:21	He's, uh, saying good-bye.
282	00:22:21	00:22:23	Do you have any kids?
283	00:22:25	00:22:28	Yes. I have two daughters.
284	00:22:56	00:22:59	Um, Mr. Michaels...
285	00:23:02	00:23:04	I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.
286	00:23:05	00:23:07	You're afraid I'm going to sue?
287	00:23:13	00:23:20	The same man who murdered your son kidnapped another boy six years ago.
288	00:23:20	00:23:22	He's here in Vegas, right now.
289	00:23:22	00:23:24	And this is closest that I've ever been to him.
290	00:23:24	00:23:26	You thought it was me.
291	00:23:27	00:23:30	I promise you...
292	00:23:30	00:23:33	that I will do everything in my power to catch this man.
293	00:23:33	00:23:36	Is that what you told the other boy's parents?
294	00:23:44	00:23:46	Those the items?
295	00:23:47	00:23:48	Yep.
296	00:23:48	00:23:50	Damn. This always happens to me.
297	00:23:50	00:23:52	Is that the surveillance?
298	00:23:52	00:23:55	Yeah.
299	00:23:55	00:23:56	That's the guy.
300	00:23:56	00:23:58	Okay.
301	00:23:58	00:24:01	I almost didn't call you guys, you know.
302	00:24:01	00:24:03	What about me? I'm out 350 bucks.
303	00:24:03	00:24:04	You'll live.
304	00:24:04	00:24:08	The woman these items belonged to is dead, along with a kid.
305	00:24:08	00:24:11	Oh.
306	00:24:11	00:24:12	Is there a reward?
307	00:24:12	00:24:15	Shut up. You saw him the night before last.
308	00:24:15	00:24:17	You talk to him? He say anything to you?
309	00:24:17	00:24:22	Not much. He showed me the jewels. I gave him his $350.
310	00:24:22	00:24:25	Uh, he asked me for directions to the Tangiers.
311	00:24:25	00:24:27	Hmm. I showed him how to get there.
312	00:24:27	00:24:28	Recommended that Let It Ride game.
313	00:24:28	00:24:30	It's been pretty lucky for me. (phone dialing)
314	00:24:30	00:24:32	Good for you.
315	00:24:32	00:24:34	Tangiers Hotel.
316	00:24:34	00:24:37	This is Captain Jim Brass, LVPD.
317	00:24:37	00:24:40	Would you connect me to the surveillance room, please?
318	00:24:42	00:24:46	That's definitely not a guy you want to go home with.
319	00:24:46	00:24:49	That cocktail waitress doesn't know how lucky she is.
320	00:24:49	00:24:51	We need a shot of his face.
321	00:24:54	00:24:55	Well, I think he knows that.
322	00:24:55	00:24:57	Just... hold on.
323	00:24:57	00:24:59	Zoom in on the ball cap.
324	00:24:59	00:25:03	There's a logo.
325	00:25:08	00:25:09	Hargreen Harvest.
326	00:25:09	00:25:14	He had commercial fertilizer on his hands when he killed Evan Michaels.
327	00:25:14	00:25:16	He's a migrant worker, perhaps.
328	00:25:16	00:25:19	Well, Tangiers sent over more than 12 hours on this guy.
329	00:25:19	00:25:23	It's gonna take some time, but of course I'll let you know the minute I find anything.
330	00:25:23	00:25:25	Okay, great.
331	00:25:27	00:25:35	I'll call in some additional AV Techs, help Archie get through the footage, but you know, I've learned that sometimes you can go faster by going slow.
332	00:25:35	00:25:38	Yeah, well, I like to go faster by going fast.
333	00:25:38	00:25:40	Waiting around is not exactly my best thing.
334	00:25:40	00:25:41	I gathered that from your interrogation technique.
335	00:25:42	00:25:45	You know, maybe you should go back to your hotel, take a nap.
336	00:25:45	00:25:49	Is this your office? Really? By choice?
337	00:25:49	00:25:53	It's not some kind of, uh, surplus overflow issue?
338	00:25:53	00:25:55	What's wrong with my office?
339	00:25:55	00:25:57	Oh, I don't know.
340	00:25:57	00:26:00	Uh... why don't you tell me?
341	00:26:00	00:26:02	That's an irradiated fetal pig.
342	00:26:02	00:26:05	I used it to determine the effects of radiation on tissue.
343	00:26:05	00:26:06	For what?
344	00:26:06	00:26:07	For fun.
345	00:26:08	00:26:10	Hey, Gil, I, uh...
346	00:26:10	00:26:12	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
347	00:26:12	00:26:14	No, no, it's fine. Jack Malone, FBI. Sara Sidle, CSI.
348	00:26:14	00:26:16	Hi.
349	00:26:16	00:26:20	Hello. I hear your abduction case is now a serial murder.
350	00:26:20	00:26:23	Uh... yeah.
351	00:26:26	00:26:32	Well, uh, I got called into work early, but I did pick up Hank, and I took him to the sitter.
352	00:26:32	00:26:34	Thank you. I'll see you when I see you.
353	00:26:35	00:26:37	Pleasure. Hmm.
354	00:26:37	00:26:39	Is Hank your kid?
355	00:26:39	00:26:42	Hank's my dog. She walks him for me sometimes.
356	00:26:42	00:26:45	Oh, yeah, that's how it starts.
357	00:26:45	00:26:49	Oh, I have some experience dating in the workplace.
358	00:26:49	00:26:53	Really? And, uh...
359	00:26:53	00:26:55	how'd it work out for you?
360	00:26:55	00:26:57	Undetermined.
361	00:27:22	00:27:24	Please, help me, help me...
362	00:27:28	00:27:31	Kid who found the old man says he lives here with his wife.
363	00:27:31	00:27:33	She doesn't answer.
364	00:27:33	00:27:35	You think the suspect's still in here?
365	00:27:35	00:27:39	We'll know in a minute.
366	00:27:39	00:27:42	You better wait here.
367	00:28:18	00:28:20	Sara...
368	00:28:36	00:28:40	Does the victim have circular indentations on her head?
369	00:28:40	00:28:43	Yeah. You want to do the autopsy, too? Just let me know.
370	00:28:43	00:28:47	My guess is, this is the hammer we didn't find at the Davis house.
371	00:28:47	00:28:55	Why take the murder weapon from one scene, walk around with it for more than a day, use it to kill again, but this time leave it behind?
372	00:28:55	00:28:58	Maybe he found something better...
373	00:28:58	00:29:02	Colt .45 auto.
374	00:29:02	00:29:03	Case is empty.
375	00:29:08	00:29:10	Huh.
376	00:29:12	00:29:16	He lost the proceeds from the Vegas murders at the Tangiers.
377	00:29:16	00:29:19	So, he probably needed more cash.
378	00:29:19	00:29:21	Double murder ATM.
379	00:29:21	00:29:24	Driver's license is on top, like before.
380	00:29:24	00:29:26	He likes to know their names.
381	00:29:26	00:29:29	I heard the husband died at the hospital.
382	00:29:29	00:29:32	But the killer was definitely here awhile.
383	00:29:32	00:29:36	According to liver temp, she died a couple hours before the husband.
384	00:29:36	00:29:42	So the husband was here and alive while his wife was being raped and killed?
385	00:29:42	00:29:44	It looks that way.
386	00:29:56	00:29:58	Sara?
387	00:29:58	00:30:00	You okay?
388	00:30:00	00:30:03	I don't know.
389	00:30:03	00:30:06	Do you have any idea how he selects his victims?
390	00:30:06	00:30:08	No.
391	00:30:08	00:30:12	He picks houses with no security systems, or dogs.
392	00:30:12	00:30:16	Enters at night when most people are asleep, through open doors or windows.
393	00:30:16	00:30:18	Easy targets.
394	00:30:18	00:30:21	So, basically at random.
395	00:30:23	00:30:28	They were spending a night on the sofa, watching a movie.
396	00:30:29	00:30:32	It's just, uh...
397	00:30:34	00:30:36	It's just wrong.
398	00:31:01	00:31:02	Grissom.
399	00:31:02	00:31:07	You at the Boulder City house? No, I'm at a railroad spur about a quarter of a mile from the house.
400	00:31:07	00:31:08	You taking a trip?
401	00:31:08	00:31:11	Carmen Davis's house was next to the tracks, too.
402	00:31:11	00:31:12	So?
403	00:31:12	00:31:15	Freight trains carry bulk fertilizer.
404	00:31:15	00:31:19	I think your killer is riding the rails.
405	00:31:19	00:31:24	All the previous murders were committed within about a mile of an active railroad spur.
406	00:31:24	00:31:30	Right, so he gets off the train, finds his victim, kills them, rapes them if he feels like it, then just takes off.
407	00:31:30	00:31:36	So, I cross-referenced similar-patterned unsolveds in ViCAP by proximity to rail spurs.
408	00:31:36	00:31:38	There's at least a dozen cases.
409	00:31:38	00:31:42	You know, you have the authority to stop all the trains coming in and out of Nevada.
410	00:31:42	00:31:45	Well, I'm not gonna do that unless I got a face.
411	00:31:45	00:31:49	If these are the work of your guy, he's piled up one hell of a body count.
412	00:31:53	00:31:56	Guy kept his head down the entire time.
413	00:31:56	00:31:57	Mm-hmm.
414	00:31:57	00:32:02	Oh, check out what happens when he runs out of money.
415	00:32:02	00:32:06	He starts hitting on the waitress, been doing it to every one of them that walked by.
416	00:32:06	00:32:07	And this...
417	00:32:07	00:32:10	is the last good image of him before he leaves the casino.
418	00:32:10	00:32:14	He stops to look at this poster and quickly makes a phone call.
419	00:32:16	00:32:18	Three numbers?
420	00:32:18	00:32:22	I don't know too many serial killers that dial 911.
421	00:32:22	00:32:24	He's calling Information.
422	00:32:27	00:32:30	Uh, yes, this is CSI Nick Stokes with the Vegas PD.
423	00:32:30	00:32:35	I need to get the telephone number of one of your pay phones on the casino floor.
424	00:32:35	00:32:37	Near the, uh, Let It Ride tables.
425	00:32:37	00:32:39	Yes, ma'am.
426	00:32:39	00:32:42	So, why was he so interested in this poster?
427	00:32:42	00:32:44	Oh, great. Okay.
428	00:32:46	00:32:48	Mm-hmm.
429	00:32:48	00:32:51	Very good. Thank you.
430	00:32:51	00:32:52	Look at this. What is it?
431	00:32:52	00:32:55	South Point Casino, just outside Boulder City.
432	00:32:55	00:32:57	Might be a reason he went there.
433	00:33:02	00:33:07	Hey, it's Nick. Uh, I need to get an AG waiver to get ahold of some phone numbers.
434	00:33:07	00:33:09	Yeah, exigent circs.
435	00:33:09	00:33:12	Mm-hmm.
436	00:33:12	00:33:16	702-555-0177.
437	00:33:17	00:33:18	At, uh...
438	00:33:18	00:33:19	17-41-33.
439	00:33:19	00:33:21	17-41-33.
440	00:33:22	00:33:24	Yes, ma'am, day before yesterday.
441	00:33:24	00:33:30	Well, we know this guy likes waitresses, so maybe that's what he's looking at.
442	00:33:30	00:33:31	Is that a D?
443	00:33:31	00:33:35	No. G, G-I-R... N?
444	00:33:35	00:33:37	Okay, thanks.
445	00:33:37	00:33:38	Gina.
446	00:33:38	00:33:39	Gina Farentino.
447	00:33:39	00:33:42	He called Information to get her number in Boulder City, but it's unlisted.
448	00:33:44	00:33:46	Maybe that's what pissed him off.
449	00:33:46	00:33:49	He knows where she works.
450	00:33:54	00:33:56	Yeah, Gina works here; she's off today, though.
451	00:33:56	00:33:57	Probably at home.
452	00:33:57	00:33:59	We checked her house; she's not there.
453	00:33:59	00:34:01	When was the last time you saw her?
454	00:34:01	00:34:02	Not since yesterday.
455	00:34:04	00:34:06	What about this guy, seen him?
456	00:34:08	00:34:11	This is the best picture you got? What do you think?
457	00:34:14	00:34:15	There was a guy...
458	00:34:15	00:34:17	I don't know if it's him.
459	00:34:17	00:34:19	He was was on those slots when Gina came on her shift.
460	00:34:22	00:34:24	Guess it was his lucky day.
461	00:34:25	00:34:27	Must've thought the jackpot gave him a shot at her.
462	00:34:27	00:34:29	He started chatting her up.
463	00:34:29	00:34:30	Oh...
464	00:34:30	00:34:31	Where are you going? No, no, no, no.
465	00:34:31	00:34:33	Hey, come here, come here. What time do you get off?
466	00:34:33	00:34:35	She blew him off and left.
467	00:34:35	00:34:36	Said she wasn't feeling well.
468	00:34:36	00:34:38	And when did he leave?

478	00:35:00	00:35:01	The whole thing has got to be bogus.
479	00:35:02	00:35:08	Yeah, the cashiers don't really seem to care, no offense, as long as you have a picture ID.
480	00:35:08	00:35:12	And even when that's fake...

531	00:41:02	00:41:04	Maybe, uh...
532	00:41:04	00:41:08	he came here to kill his ex-wife.

537	00:41:21	00:41:26	Gina Farentino was supposed to pick up her son, only she didn't show up.

545	00:41:54	00:41:56	I don't think that trooper was waving at Gina.

548	00:42:09	00:42:14	You said the kid who was kidnapped was six years old when he was adopted, birth parents unknown.
549	00:42:14	00:42:16	That's right.
550	00:42:16	00:42:20	Terry Wicker was looking for his ex-wife...
