5,00:01:38,00:01:40,"Oh, my God, you're killing me."
6,00:01:47,00:01:49,"Don't worry, Roc, we're still in good shape."
7,00:01:50,00:01:51,"We're only two back (quietly): Ah, man."
8,00:01:51,00:01:53,"of Waldorf now, and that Nagano kid's totally in the tank."
9,00:01:53,00:01:54,We can still do this.
10,00:01:57,00:01:57,Ho.
11,00:01:58,00:01:59,"I mean,youcan still do it, Roc."
12,00:01:59,00:02:00,That's what I meant.
13,00:02:00,00:02:04,"Pards, if that's our ball, we're definitely going to need a ruling."
14,00:02:04,00:02:08,"Gary, Rocco's dead in here, but I got to tell you, I don't think he's the only one."
15,00:02:09,00:02:10,(camera shutter clicking)
16,00:02:10,00:02:14,"ROBBINS: So, the guy says it was an accident."
17,00:02:14,00:02:16,That he didn't mean to kill his wife.
18,00:02:16,00:02:18,The golf ball just hit her in the head.
19,00:02:18,00:02:27,"So the detective says, ""Well, the coroner also found a golf ball lodged up against her rectum."" And the guy says..."
20,00:02:27,00:02:31,"""Yeah, that was my mulligan."" You've heard it before."
21,00:02:31,00:02:32,It's an old one.
22,00:02:32,00:02:33,"Well, this is new."
23,00:02:33,00:02:35,Dead man in a golf cart.
24,00:02:36,00:02:39,Medium caliber bullet hole right side of the throat.
25,00:02:40,00:02:43,Maybe a nine millimeter or a .38.
26,00:02:43,00:02:45,And no exit wound.
27,00:02:45,00:02:47,The blood's reddish brown.
28,00:02:47,00:02:49,Deoxygenated. That's right.
29,00:02:50,00:02:51,Bullet hit his jugular.
30,00:02:51,00:02:53,He's in full rigor.
31,00:02:53,00:02:55,T.O.D.'s ten to 12 hours ago.
32,00:02:55,00:02:58,"Excuse me, excuse me."
33,00:02:58,00:02:59,Uh...
34,00:02:59,00:03:02,"he was dead before my ball got there, wasn't he?"
35,00:03:02,00:03:05,"Well, so far, it seems that way."
36,00:03:05,00:03:07,But don't leave town.
37,00:03:10,00:03:12,"OFFICER: Sir, you have to stay behind the tape."
38,00:03:12,00:03:13,"ROBBINS: Sorry, Cath, no I.D."
39,00:03:14,00:03:16,"Oh, the club official told me that his name is Russell Huntley."
40,00:03:16,00:03:19,"He's a member, so he's out here often."
41,00:03:19,00:03:21,Apparently he used to be a pro.
42,00:03:21,00:03:24,This is his own personal cart.
43,00:03:25,00:03:28,This club head cover's saturated in blood.
44,00:03:28,00:03:33,"The victim probably grabbed whatever was within his reach, and tried to staunch the bleeding."
45,00:03:33,00:03:39,"But this soft, porous fabric probably acted more like a sponge."
46,00:03:39,00:03:42,"So we've got a club head cover, but no clubs."
47,00:03:42,00:03:44,A little overdressed for night putting.
48,00:04:00,00:04:03,(camera shutter clicking)
49,00:04:14,00:04:15,(phone rings)
50,00:04:16,00:04:17,"What have you got, Catherine?"
51,00:04:17,00:04:18,It's a dead end.
52,00:04:18,00:04:23,"The golf cart tracks end on the main path, which means it could have come from practically anywhere on the course."
53,00:04:23,00:04:25,Which also means we don't know the primary crime scene.
54,00:04:25,00:04:27,That's right.
55,00:04:27,00:04:30,I guess we'll just have to play it where it lies.
56,00:04:30,00:04:31,Yeah.
57,00:05:07,00:05:09,"MAN 1: Yesterday this kid comes out of nowhere, fires a 61."
58,00:05:10,00:05:16,"MAN 2: Well, Gary, after a disastrous opening nine-- 41-- Nagano in trouble again here at the 11th."
59,00:05:16,00:05:19,GARY: I don't think that break in the action helped him at all.
60,00:05:19,00:05:20,"I mean, not that it would."
61,00:05:21,00:05:24,He's been all over the place... Mrs. Huntley?
62,00:05:24,00:05:26,Not since we divorced.
63,00:05:26,00:05:28,Michelle Nagano.
64,00:05:28,00:05:29,How do you do?
65,00:05:29,00:05:31,"I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas police."
66,00:05:32,00:05:35,I have to ask you a few questions.
67,00:05:35,00:05:37,I'm sorry for your loss.
68,00:05:39,00:05:41,No one mentioned that you were Russell's ex-wife.
69,00:05:41,00:05:45,"Our family's been coming to this club for so long, people just assume."
70,00:05:45,00:05:46,It doesn't matter. I see.
71,00:05:46,00:05:48,MAN 2: Nagano in trouble again here at the 11th.
72,00:05:48,00:05:52,"After hitting it all over this hole, he's got a four and a half footer downhill for bogey."
73,00:05:52,00:05:56,But this is the only part of his game that's been any good today.
74,00:05:57,00:05:58,(gallery groaning)
75,00:05:58,00:06:00,"(over TV): Oh... oh, boy."
76,00:06:00,00:06:02,This is not for the faint of heart.
77,00:06:02,00:06:06,So that's your son in the tournament?
78,00:06:06,00:06:08,I'm his stepmother.
79,00:06:08,00:06:09,He's Russell's son.
80,00:06:09,00:06:13,But with your last name. That's curious.
81,00:06:13,00:06:14,It was his decision.
82,00:06:14,00:06:16,I raised him. Oh.
83,00:06:16,00:06:19,"So, when was the last time you saw Russell?"
84,00:06:19,00:06:22,"Last night, after the first round."
85,00:06:22,00:06:24,"MAN (tapping glass): Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please."
86,00:06:24,00:06:25,Maestro.
87,00:06:26,00:06:27,Duffy would like to say a few words.
88,00:06:27,00:06:29,"Thanks, Gary."
89,00:06:29,00:06:32,"Here's to Danny Nagano, the new course record holder."
90,00:06:32,00:06:36,"Enjoy the night, kid, because tomorrow I'm gonna be gunning for you."
91,00:06:36,00:06:39,"Are you going to stand for that, Danny?"
92,00:06:39,00:06:40,Danny?
93,00:06:40,00:06:41,It's one round.
94,00:06:41,00:06:42,You didn't win the tournament.
95,00:06:42,00:06:44,"No, you shot one round. What's the matter?"
96,00:06:45,00:06:47,"Can't you stand the fact that your son beat your old record, huh?"
97,00:06:47,00:06:49,Don't take that tone with me. No. You go home.
98,00:06:50,00:06:51,You are drunk.
99,00:06:51,00:06:53,Go home before you embarrass yourself any more than you have.
100,00:06:53,00:06:56,"Hey, try to remember what this game is really about. Go."
101,00:06:56,00:06:58,Don't worry. Shake it off.
102,00:07:01,00:07:04,"If you'll excuse me, I have funeral arrangements to make."
103,00:07:04,00:07:08,I understand. Thank you.
104,00:07:34,00:07:39,"PHILLIPS: I couldn't find the bullet, and with no exit wound, I don't think he was shot."
105,00:07:39,00:07:42,Take a look.
106,00:07:42,00:07:47,"Well, if that's the case, this wound might indicate sharp-force trauma."
107,00:07:53,00:07:56,There's a fragment of something.
108,00:07:58,00:08:00,Black plastic maybe?
109,00:08:00,00:08:04,With something else embedded in it?
110,00:08:07,00:08:09,Huh.
111,00:08:13,00:08:15,Got a sportsbook ticket from the Eclipse.
112,00:08:15,00:08:17,Thank you.
113,00:08:17,00:08:20,"If he picked a winner, is the casino obligated to pay his next of kin?"
114,00:08:21,00:08:22,Yes. I'll Q.D. that.
115,00:08:22,00:08:24,And you can I.D. this.
116,00:08:24,00:08:27,"So, find out what's on his shoes."
117,00:08:27,00:08:28,"Oh, is that all?"
118,00:08:28,00:08:30,We don't have a primary crime scene.
119,00:08:30,00:08:32,We need to know where he was.
120,00:08:32,00:08:35,(imitates Johnny Carson): I'm thinking a golf course.
121,00:08:35,00:08:36,(imitating Ed McMahon): Hi-oh!
122,00:08:36,00:08:38,WILLOWS: David!
123,00:08:41,00:08:43,(camera shutter clicking)
124,00:08:43,00:08:45,"Well, this ought to keep Hodges busy for a while."
125,00:08:45,00:08:48,"So, uh, Dr. Ray? Yes?"
126,00:08:48,00:08:50,What's your handicap?
127,00:08:50,00:08:52,I don't golf.
128,00:08:52,00:08:54,I thought all doctors played golf.
129,00:08:54,00:08:55,Maybe only the rich ones.
130,00:08:55,00:08:57,"Oh, come on now."
131,00:08:57,00:08:58,That's not true.
132,00:08:58,00:08:59,Anybody can play golf.
133,00:08:59,00:09:01,There's plenty of public golf courses.
134,00:09:02,00:09:03,SIDLE: Sure there are.
135,00:09:03,00:09:09,"LANGSTON: Mark Twain referred to golf as ""A good walk spoiled."" (chuckles)"
136,00:09:09,00:09:12,"Well, it can be, if you don't stay in bounds, believe me."
137,00:09:18,00:09:23,This medium-velocity spatter I've got on the roof here looks like it could be cast-off.
138,00:09:26,00:09:27,(grunting)
139,00:09:27,00:09:31,Was there any evidence of a passenger at the crash site?
140,00:09:31,00:09:32,"LANGSTON: No, but these things aren't exactly race cars."
141,00:09:32,00:09:36,It wouldn't be hard to jump out of one while it was moving.
142,00:09:36,00:09:38,"Which puts up back to, where is the primary? Right."
143,00:09:38,00:09:44,"Hey, the balls in this shag bag are Jupiter PTXs, but the ones in the front rack are Fuschidas."
144,00:09:44,00:09:46,That's fascinating.
145,00:09:46,00:09:49,Different balls are designed with different playing characteristics.
146,00:09:49,00:09:53,Some hit the green and stop dead; others have a harder core for the long game.
147,00:09:53,00:09:56,"You know, each one is unique, Sara."
148,00:09:56,00:09:58,"Oh, just like snowflakes."
149,00:09:58,00:10:03,Exactly. I think Nick's point is two different types of balls suggest two different players?
150,00:10:03,00:10:06,Possibly.
151,00:10:06,00:10:07,(cheering)
152,00:10:12,00:10:14,"Hang in there, Danny."
153,00:10:14,00:10:16,"If there's anything I can do, you let me know, yeah?"
154,00:10:16,00:10:18,"Thanks, Jonathan. Take care, man."
155,00:10:18,00:10:19,"BRASS: Mr. Nagano, can I talk to you?"
156,00:10:20,00:10:22,"I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas police."
157,00:10:22,00:10:24,I need to ask you a few questions.
158,00:10:24,00:10:26,"Do we have to do this now, Detective? I'm afraid so."
159,00:10:26,00:10:27,"Yeah, today's been kind of rough."
160,00:10:27,00:10:29,"Well, been really rough for his dad."
161,00:10:29,00:10:31,"He'll meet you in the clubhouse, okay?"
162,00:10:31,00:10:33,"Don't forget to sign your card, kiddo."
163,00:10:33,00:10:35,Thanks a lot.
164,00:10:35,00:10:38,"Sorry about this, but I got to ask you, when was the last time you saw your father?"
165,00:10:39,00:10:40,Last night.
166,00:10:40,00:10:42,There was a party in the clubhouse.
167,00:10:42,00:10:44,Your stepmother mentioned that.
168,00:10:44,00:10:45,You broke his course record.
169,00:10:45,00:10:47,"Well, that must have been tricky."
170,00:10:47,00:10:48,"I mean, he was a competitive guy, right?"
171,00:10:48,00:10:50,How did he feel about that?
172,00:10:50,00:10:52,"We just happened to be in the room with the bar, so..."
173,00:10:52,00:10:55,"Here's to Danny Nagano, the new course record holder."
174,00:10:55,00:10:57,"Enjoy the night, kid."
175,00:10:57,00:11:00,So you think this puts you in the same league as your old man?
176,00:11:00,00:11:02,"Ah, I wouldn't set my sights that low. Why you little piece..."
177,00:11:02,00:11:05,"Russell, please, not on a night like tonight."
178,00:11:05,00:11:07,"Please, don't do this. Hey, Mom, it's okay."
179,00:11:07,00:11:09,He's just ranting and probably drunk.
180,00:11:09,00:11:11,"Don't take that tone with me. No, go home, Dad."
181,00:11:11,00:11:14,Go home before you embarrass yourself more than you already have.
182,00:11:14,00:11:19,Why don't you try to remember what this game is really about.
183,00:11:19,00:11:20,"Good night. Just ignore him, okay?"
184,00:11:20,00:11:23,"Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. It's your night."
185,00:11:23,00:11:25,And that was the last thing he ever said to me. Hmm.
186,00:11:28,00:11:30,"I gotta go turn in my scorecard. No, I understand."
187,00:11:30,00:11:31,Thanks for the help.
188,00:11:31,00:11:32,Thank you very much.
189,00:11:34,00:11:35,"WOMAN: Copper Glen, manager's office."
190,00:11:35,00:11:37,"Yes, this is Captain Brass."
191,00:11:37,00:11:38,"How can I help you, sir?"
192,00:11:38,00:11:42,"Look, I need to know who was on duty at the clubhouse bar last night."
193,00:11:42,00:11:44,Preferably somebody with a good memory.
194,00:12:07,00:12:09,(electronic chirp)
195,00:12:39,00:12:41,(rapid trilling)
196,00:12:42,00:12:44,(beeping)
197,00:12:44,00:12:46,Russell Huntley's prints are on the Jupiters.
198,00:12:46,00:12:47,That's not surprising.
199,00:12:47,00:12:49,Let's see what we've got on the Fuschidas.
200,00:12:49,00:12:57,WILLOWS: The fragment we recovered from the victim's neck wound is carbon fiber reinforced polymer and thermosetting epoxide polymer.
201,00:12:57,00:12:59,Graphite and epoxy.
202,00:12:59,00:13:00,He got shafted.
203,00:13:00,00:13:03,"Yeah, the murder weapon is most likely the composite shaft of a golf club."
204,00:13:03,00:13:05,How appropriate. WILLOWS: Mm-hmm.
205,00:13:07,00:13:12,STOKES: Here's some prints on a Fuschida belonging to a guy named John Dudek.
206,00:13:12,00:13:14,LANGSTON: I believe he's the son's caddy.
207,00:13:16,00:13:19,STOKES: And another print on a Fuschida.
208,00:13:19,00:13:22,Belonging to Erin Nagano.
209,00:13:22,00:13:23,WLVU student.
210,00:13:23,00:13:25,"Ooh, quite a record."
211,00:13:25,00:13:30,"I'd say. ""DUI, disorderly conduct, open or gross lewdness."" On a golf course?"
212,00:13:33,00:13:35,She's Michelle's sister.
213,00:13:35,00:13:40,With her prints all over her sister's ex's balls.
214,00:13:57,00:13:58,Erin Nagano?
215,00:13:58,00:14:00,That's me.
216,00:14:00,00:14:03,My name's Nick... Goggle up and tell me who you are.
217,00:14:03,00:14:05,Oh.
218,00:14:05,00:14:08,"Okay, sure."
219,00:14:08,00:14:11,I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.
220,00:14:12,00:14:13,Interferometer?
221,00:14:13,00:14:15,No.
222,00:14:15,00:14:17,Optical heterodyne detector.
223,00:14:17,00:14:19,Yeah. Yeah. Nice.
224,00:14:19,00:14:21,"All right, am I getting busted?"
225,00:14:21,00:14:23,"Now, why would I want to go and do something like that?"
226,00:14:23,00:14:27,No reason. It's just happened before.
227,00:14:27,00:14:29,"Yeah, that I do know about you."
228,00:14:29,00:14:34,Your prints were found on a golf ball in a cart Russell Huntley's body was found dead in.
229,00:14:35,00:14:36,Really?
230,00:14:36,00:14:38,P.D. passed your picture around in the clubhouse.
231,00:14:38,00:14:41,Bartender said he saw you with Russell the night that he died.
232,00:14:41,00:14:44,Said it looked like you two were in a fight.
233,00:14:44,00:14:45,...leave Danny alone!
234,00:14:45,00:14:47,"I was at the party, yeah."
235,00:14:47,00:14:49,But for Danny.
236,00:14:49,00:14:52,I blew off my Physics 101 section so I could watch his round.
237,00:14:52,00:14:54,And I saw every single amazing shot.
238,00:14:54,00:14:56,What was going on with you and Russell?
239,00:14:56,00:14:57,"Oh, damn."
240,00:14:58,00:15:00,"I mean, you make it sound like we're just knocking it out."
241,00:15:00,00:15:03,Were you?
242,00:15:03,00:15:08,"Oh, believe me, even if Russ hadn't been married to my sister, I'm not into old retired pros."
243,00:15:08,00:15:16,"But if Michelle had been married to a pro looper, then yeah, sure, she might have had some competition."
244,00:15:16,00:15:17,A looper? You're into caddies?
245,00:15:18,00:15:19,What can I say?
246,00:15:19,00:15:21,I just like a man who hauls a big bag.
247,00:15:23,00:15:24,(chuckles)
248,00:15:24,00:15:25,Maybe Russell was drinking.
249,00:15:25,00:15:27,I know I was.
250,00:15:27,00:15:34,"He had a lot to be angry about, because he was a douche, to my sister and to Danny."
251,00:15:34,00:15:36,I had as little to do with him as possible.
252,00:15:36,00:15:38,Still doesn't explain how the golf ball got in the cart.
253,00:15:38,00:15:40,I don't know how those got there.
254,00:15:40,00:15:44,"I mean, sometimes I buy balls for Danny."
255,00:15:44,00:15:46,But I've never given anything to Russell.
256,00:15:46,00:15:48,You buy Fuschida golf balls for Danny.
257,00:15:49,00:15:51,He gets all that stuff for free.
258,00:15:51,00:15:58,"All right, look, a couple of years ago, before Danny started making noise on the tour, I bought him a box of Fuschidas before the Las Vegas Open."
259,00:15:58,00:15:59,As a gift.
260,00:15:59,00:16:02,"You know, 'cause he is my step-nephew."
261,00:16:02,00:16:06,"Anyways, Danny ends up winning and, ta-da, a new tradition's born."
262,00:16:07,00:16:14,"Golfers are hardcore superstitious, so every time Danny tees it up in competition, I have to fork over the dough and buy him a brand-new box of those pills."
263,00:16:14,00:16:16,"And trust me, they are not cheap."
264,00:16:16,00:16:18,And I'm still in school.
265,00:17:42,00:17:43,So...
266,00:17:43,00:17:46,you got a primary crime scene?
267,00:17:46,00:17:58,"Well, the soil on your vic's shoes had a pH range of 5.0 to 7.1, with traces of potassium, hydrogen, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper."
268,00:17:58,00:18:02,"And I I.D.'d all the grasses as bent, Bermuda and rye."
269,00:18:02,00:18:04,Which means?
270,00:18:04,00:18:05,He was on a golf course.
271,00:18:05,00:18:11,Soil and grass with all of those properties can be found at numerous places on both courses of Copper Glen.
272,00:18:11,00:18:13,"In other words, you got nothing."
273,00:18:13,00:18:17,"When you put it that way, it makes me sound ineffectual."
274,00:18:17,00:18:19,That's the secret to good leadership.
275,00:18:21,00:18:23,(sighs)
276,00:18:23,00:18:28,"According to laser girl, the Fuschida golf balls in Russell's cart belong to Danny."
277,00:18:28,00:18:32,Danny's prints weren't on the balls or anywhere on the cart; just his caddy's.
278,00:18:32,00:18:34,At least we know who to talk to next.
279,00:18:34,00:18:36,"Hey, guys, you gotta see this."
280,00:18:36,00:18:42,"Before John Dudek became a caddy, he was a professional golfer."
281,00:18:42,00:18:44,He toured in Europe and North America.
282,00:18:44,00:18:46,He went from pro to caddy?
283,00:18:46,00:18:48,Usually it's the other way around.
284,00:18:48,00:18:50,"Well, it wasn't by choice."
285,00:18:50,00:18:53,He was suspended for the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs.
286,00:18:53,00:18:55,Specifically propranolol.
287,00:18:55,00:18:56,That's a beta-blocker.
288,00:19:00,00:19:05,"They're designed to lower heart rate, reduce tremors."
289,00:19:08,00:19:11,They don't really enhance performance so much as they ease anxiety.
290,00:19:11,00:19:16,"But they're still banned in all professional sports, including golf."
291,00:19:16,00:19:18,Want to know how Dudek got caught?
292,00:19:18,00:19:19,"Yeah, lay it on me."
293,00:19:19,00:19:21,Russell Huntley dimed him out.
294,00:19:22,00:19:31,"MAN: ...but, for the most part, golf has been spared scandals involving performance-enhancing drugs, which is why the suspension of John Dudek in 1987 was so notable."
295,00:19:31,00:19:32,It was a disgrace.
296,00:19:33,00:19:34,You had a very personal stake in it.
297,00:19:34,00:19:38,"When he was on tour, you often referred to John Dudek as a brother."
298,00:19:38,00:19:40,That's the way I felt about him.
299,00:19:40,00:19:49,"There's an old saying: ""If you're not cheating, you're not really trying."" That kind of attitude doesn't have a place in golf."
300,00:19:49,00:19:54,The only person you're really playing out there is yourself.
301,00:19:54,00:20:05,"At the end of day, when you put your name on that scorecard, you're swearing, ""This is what I did, this is who I am."" John tried to put himself above the honor of the game."
302,00:20:05,00:20:06,I couldn't let him.
303,00:20:06,00:20:07,Nobody gets to do that.
304,00:20:14,00:20:31,"WOMAN: Golf Laboratories state-of-the art computer-controlled robot offers today's professional complete mastery over all variables of the game-- from club and shaft dynamics to overall ball performance, our robot is indispensable to teaching and the advancement of golf technology in the 21st century."
305,00:20:35,00:20:37,Excuse me.
306,00:20:37,00:20:39,"Come on, man, no autographs right now. I'm working here."
307,00:20:39,00:20:42,"That was a very nice finish, but you've been laying it off at the top a little bit lately."
308,00:20:42,00:20:44,You might want to watch that.
309,00:20:44,00:20:45,My name's Ray Langston.
310,00:20:45,00:20:49,"I'm with the Crime Lab, and I need to speak to Mr. Dudek, if you don't mind."
311,00:20:49,00:20:50,"Catch you later, Johnny. I hope."
312,00:20:53,00:20:55,How can I help you?
313,00:20:56,00:21:02,"Well, you can tell me why we found your fingerprints on a golf ball that we found near Russell Huntley's body."
314,00:21:02,00:21:04,Russell Huntley-- you remember him.
315,00:21:04,00:21:08,He's the man that turned you into a caddy after he ratted you off the tour.
316,00:21:08,00:21:10,That was over 25 years ago.
317,00:21:10,00:21:11,It was another lifetime.
318,00:21:12,00:21:18,"What do you want me to say, I killed Russell 'cause he ruined my life? You can say whatever you like, Mr. Dudek."
319,00:21:18,00:21:22,"Look, I didn't become Tiger Woods, but you want to know something?"
320,00:21:22,00:21:23,Being Steve Williams isn't half bad.
321,00:21:25,00:21:26,Steve Williams is Tiger Woods' caddy.
322,00:21:26,00:21:28,I'm aware of who Steve Williams is.
323,00:21:28,00:21:31,I just don't care.
324,00:21:31,00:21:32,What about your prints?
325,00:21:33,00:21:35,I don't know.
326,00:21:35,00:21:37,Maybe Russell borrowed some of Danny's balls.
327,00:21:37,00:21:41,I didn't get the impression that they were that friendly.
328,00:21:41,00:21:43,How'd you wind up on Danny's bag?
329,00:21:43,00:21:47,I was at the hospital with Russell the night that Danny was born.
330,00:21:47,00:21:50,And on the green the day he picked up his first clubs.
331,00:21:51,00:21:54,"Years after Russell blew up my career, Danny called me, asked me if I would carry for him."
332,00:21:54,00:21:55,Gave me a way back.
333,00:21:56,00:21:57,He's a good kid.
334,00:21:57,00:22:05,"So the other day, you and Danny set fire to the course, you partied at the clubhouse, and then what?"
335,00:22:05,00:22:08,Same as every night-- pizza and porn.
336,00:22:23,00:22:24,(beep)
337,00:22:35,00:22:44,"SIDLE: So, Russell corners laser girl, argues with his son and his ex-wife, and then leaves the party around 7:15 p.m."
338,00:22:44,00:22:48,His body was found the next morning on the golf course at...
339,00:22:48,00:22:52,"9:45 a.m., which gives us a gap of 14 and a half hours."
340,00:22:52,00:22:54,And we still don't have a primary crime scene.
341,00:22:56,00:23:03,"Russell Huntley placed a $5,000 over/under bet on Danny's first round score."
342,00:23:03,00:23:04,Cash in on his son's success.
343,00:23:04,00:23:07,"No, actually he bet against his son."
344,00:23:07,00:23:09,"Man, he bet the ball on Danny?"
345,00:23:09,00:23:11,Bet the ball? WILLOWS: He bet the over.
346,00:23:11,00:23:16,"He bet that his son, a professional golfer, wouldn't even break par. That's cold."
347,00:23:16,00:23:17,LANGSTON: Danny shot 61.
348,00:23:17,00:23:20,Russell lost the bet-- big time.
349,00:23:20,00:23:22,Sounds like a better theory for father killing son.
350,00:23:22,00:23:26,"STOKES: You know, Danny's round was pretty incredible."
351,00:23:26,00:23:28,"I mean, a 61's no joke."
352,00:23:28,00:23:35,There's nothing in his recent tournament history to suggest he was on the verge of blowing up.
353,00:23:35,00:23:38,What if Danny was cheating?
354,00:23:38,00:23:40,And his father found out about it.
355,00:23:40,00:23:44,"Danny's caddy, John Dudek, has a history of cheating."
356,00:23:44,00:23:48,"""Honor the game above all else."" That was Russell's credo."
357,00:23:49,00:23:53,"WILLOWS: Well, if you think that cheating is a viable motive, see if you can prove it."
358,00:23:58,00:24:04,"Every amateur golfer, at one time or another, has used the old foot-wedge to improve his lie, but it's a big no-no in tournament play."
359,00:24:04,00:24:09,I once played a podiatrist who used to apply lip balm to his driver to reduce his side spin.
360,00:24:09,00:24:11,He still couldn't break a hundred.
361,00:24:11,00:24:12,I thought you said you didn't play.
362,00:24:12,00:24:16,"I did, once upon a time, but not anymore."
363,00:24:16,00:24:21,So how does a professional golfer cheat with the cameras and the eyes of the gallery on him?
364,00:24:21,00:24:23,Think the answer is in these pages?
365,00:24:23,00:24:26,The list of conforming balls is 35 pages long.
366,00:24:26,00:24:28,So is the list of non-conforming balls.
367,00:24:28,00:24:32,"Right. Conforming drivers, non-conforming drivers."
368,00:24:32,00:24:36,Standards designed to balance human skill against technological advantage.
369,00:24:36,00:24:43,To prevent things like drivers from adding distance with a trampoline effect.
370,00:24:43,00:24:48,STOKES:Or that the ball's dimple pattern doesn't greatly reduce the drag or spin rate.
371,00:24:48,00:24:49,But it's still just a game.
372,00:24:49,00:24:52,"It's a golfer, a club and a ball."
373,00:24:52,00:24:57,"Yeah. Yeah, if Danny was cheating, he was either messing with the ball, his club or his body."
374,00:24:57,00:24:59,Or all three. Mm-hmm.
375,00:24:59,00:25:01,DANNY: I just don't understand why they need my clubs.
376,00:25:01,00:25:02,It's all in the warrant.
377,00:25:03,00:25:05,Come on in here. I want to show you something.
378,00:25:05,00:25:07,Sit here.
379,00:25:07,00:25:08,Watch this. Check it out.
380,00:25:08,00:25:12,HUNTLEY: Golf is not a game of perfect.
381,00:25:12,00:25:16,"No matter how good you are, you'll want to get better at it, and you'll never master it."
382,00:25:16,00:25:28,"But that, like any great love affair, is the pain and the passion of golf, whether you're playing against the greatest players in the world or just knocking around on a late afternoon with your son."
383,00:25:28,00:25:31,Why are you showing me this?
384,00:25:31,00:25:32,"You know, jog your memory a little bit."
385,00:25:32,00:25:38,"I mean, for someone whose father just got killed, you seem a little... detached."
386,00:25:38,00:25:41,Hmm? Why is that?
387,00:25:42,00:25:45,You know what I remember most about that day?
388,00:25:45,00:25:46,What?
389,00:25:47,00:25:49,My dad's driver.
390,00:25:50,00:25:52,It was a gift from Byron Nelson.
391,00:25:52,00:25:57,Hmm. A '55 five-screw MacGregor MT Eye-O-Matic.
392,00:25:57,00:25:58,He loved that club.
393,00:26:02,00:26:04,My father started coaching me when I was five.
394,00:26:04,00:26:05,Dropped me when I was 19.
395,00:26:05,00:26:07,Too many false starts.
396,00:26:07,00:26:09,"Too many choked-out finishes, he said."
397,00:26:09,00:26:11,Didn't have what it takes.
398,00:26:11,00:26:13,"So is that why you brought Dudek back, huh?"
399,00:26:13,00:26:14,To stick it to the old man?
400,00:26:14,00:26:16,Give yourself a different kind of edge?
401,00:26:16,00:26:19,You think I'm cheating?
402,00:26:19,00:26:20,"Sir, I'm gonna take your blood."
403,00:26:20,00:26:22,You're not taking anything from me. Is that what you think?
404,00:26:23,00:26:25,"I can come back later... No, do it now."
405,00:26:25,00:26:27,We're gonna take your blood. It's in the warrant.
406,00:27:17,00:27:19,(beeping)
407,00:27:31,00:27:32,Nice.
408,00:27:32,00:27:35,Thanks.
409,00:27:35,00:27:37,LANGSTON: There is nothing unusual about any of his clubs.
410,00:27:37,00:27:39,And all of his golf balls check out.
411,00:27:39,00:27:43,"Dimple pattern, weight, diameter, they're all up to spec."
412,00:27:43,00:27:47,"So I got expanded tox on Danny Nagano's blood, and I got nothing."
413,00:27:47,00:27:51,No traces of propranolol or any other beta-blockers in his system.
414,00:27:51,00:27:53,Maybe we were wrong.
415,00:27:53,00:27:55,Maybe Danny has game after all.
416,00:27:56,00:27:59,Sorry; I'm sorry. I'll clean that up.
417,00:27:59,00:28:01,"That's all right... Wait, wait, wait, wait."
418,00:28:01,00:28:03,"(golf ball bouncing, clacking)"
419,00:28:12,00:28:14,What is it?
420,00:28:14,00:28:17,A not-so-inelastic collision.
421,00:28:22,00:28:23,"HODGES: Hey, guys."
422,00:28:23,00:28:25,"LANGSTON: Hodges, you want to know what we're doing?"
423,00:28:26,00:28:28,I guess that means you found the primary crime scene.
424,00:28:36,00:28:42,The center mass of the ball from Russell's cart is almost 20% harder than it should be.
425,00:28:42,00:28:44,Danny was definitely cheating.
426,00:28:44,00:28:51,"There was no evidence of any tampering on the shell, so how do you harden a polybutadiene core without leaving a mark?"
427,00:28:54,00:28:56,Frickin' laser beams.
428,00:28:58,00:29:01,"Isn't this, like, a matter for, like, the USGA?"
429,00:29:01,00:29:06,"Murder during the course of a felony, such as fraud, is a matter for us."
430,00:29:06,00:29:07,Whoa.
431,00:29:07,00:29:09,Murder?
432,00:29:09,00:29:10,That's right.
433,00:29:10,00:29:12,"You know, I..."
434,00:29:12,00:29:14,"I read a lot, Erin."
435,00:29:14,00:29:22,And I remember a write-up a few years back about some Japanese scientists who exposed golf balls to focused X-ray sources.
436,00:29:24,00:29:31,"They found that the radiation altered the composition of the cores, making them harder, which increased the distance per drive."
437,00:29:31,00:29:33,"I mean, it's not a hard experiment to duplicate."
438,00:29:33,00:29:36,"Especially not for a bright, young laser jockey like yourself."
439,00:29:36,00:29:38,"All right, so I juiced the balls."
440,00:29:39,00:29:40,But that's all.
441,00:29:40,00:29:43,"Giving them to Danny, that was Dudek's idea."
442,00:29:43,00:29:48,"I heard Erin bragging in the clubhouse, a few weeks ago, about what she could do with her lasers and balls."
443,00:29:48,00:29:49,So I asked her if she could make me some.
444,00:29:49,00:29:51,Did you tell her what for? She didn't care.
445,00:29:51,00:29:56,She just wanted one thing in exchange-- Sex.
446,00:29:56,00:29:59,"Bad kitty, I know."
447,00:29:59,00:30:04,"I'm only consoled, though, by some recent studies suggesting a link between IQ and sex drive."
448,00:30:05,00:30:06,In women.
449,00:30:06,00:30:07,Hmm.
450,00:30:07,00:30:09,Danny just needed a edge.
451,00:30:09,00:30:14,Making a living on ten percent doesn't work unless your man's into the serious money.
452,00:30:15,00:30:16,Right?
453,00:30:16,00:30:17,All right.
454,00:30:17,00:30:18,I needed an edge.
455,00:30:18,00:30:20,Danny had nothing to do with it.
456,00:30:20,00:30:22,Why do I find that so hard to believe?
457,00:30:22,00:30:25,The kid has never cheated a day in his life.
458,00:30:25,00:30:27,He had no idea.
459,00:30:27,00:30:28,He-He was just having a great round.
460,00:30:31,00:30:33,Try this.
461,00:30:33,00:30:35,A nine iron? I can't get there with that.
462,00:30:35,00:30:37,"You can today, kiddo. Believe."
463,00:30:49,00:30:51,(cheering)
464,00:30:51,00:30:53,"But Russell... he figured it out, didn't he?"
465,00:30:53,00:30:54,He knew better.
466,00:30:54,00:30:56,Yeah.
467,00:30:56,00:30:59,Danny didn't have enough talent to play the way he did today.
468,00:30:59,00:31:01,"You gave him some of those damn laser balls, didn't you?"
469,00:31:01,00:31:04,"Look, I don't know what you're talking about, sunshine."
470,00:31:04,00:31:05,Is this Dudek's idea?
471,00:31:05,00:31:06,Is Dudek helping Danny cheat?
472,00:31:06,00:31:07,Is that it?
473,00:31:07,00:31:09,Why don't you just leave Danny alone?
474,00:31:09,00:31:11,Just let him enjoy the moment.
475,00:31:11,00:31:13,"MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please."
476,00:31:13,00:31:15,Duffy would like to say a few words.
477,00:31:15,00:31:18,And that was the last time that I saw him alive; I swear.
478,00:31:18,00:31:20,"Why should I believe you now, Erin?"
479,00:31:22,00:31:24,Can I borrow your phone?
480,00:31:25,00:31:26,I'm not calling a lawyer.
481,00:31:28,00:31:30,"Yeah. Yeah, sure."
482,00:31:32,00:31:34,I can show you my alibi.
483,00:31:37,00:31:40,I put a Webcam in my lab.
484,00:31:40,00:31:42,To document research.
485,00:31:42,00:31:46,"You see, um, I couldn't have killed Russell."
486,00:31:48,00:31:50,I was kind of busy.
487,00:31:50,00:31:52,"Yeah, yeah, kind of."
488,00:31:56,00:32:00,"Like I said, pizza and porn."
489,00:32:16,00:32:20,Rhizoctonia solani.
490,00:32:20,00:32:24,"It's a fungus that causes ""large patch disease"" in zoysia grass and Bermuda grass."
491,00:32:24,00:32:26,A fungus on a golf course is bad.
492,00:32:27,00:32:28,"Yes, but for us, it's very, very good."
493,00:32:29,00:32:34,"You see, the greenskeepers at Copper Glen are doing a magnificent job keeping the Rhizoc at bay."
494,00:32:34,00:32:36,Only two areas are currently affected.
495,00:32:36,00:32:40,This one near the clubhouse is being used during the tournament by the media.
496,00:32:40,00:32:44,But this one is a private teaching range behind course number two.
497,00:32:44,00:32:47,"Technically, it's closed."
498,00:32:47,00:32:50,You see what you can accomplish when your pride's on the line?
499,00:32:50,00:32:53,Every day of my life.
500,00:33:03,00:33:05,(beeping)
501,00:33:24,00:33:31,"Okay, so we have Russell's bag, his jacket and an open box of Fuschidas."
502,00:33:34,00:33:37,"Weird, there's no driver in here."
503,00:33:42,00:33:44,SIDLE: Here's Hodge's fungus.
504,00:33:44,00:33:49,"You know, golf always struck me as the kind of sport that might appeal to Grissom."
505,00:33:49,00:33:50,(laughing) I don't know.
506,00:33:50,00:33:52,It's never come up.
507,00:33:52,00:33:56,Sometimes I wonder if you two are really married.
508,00:33:56,00:33:58,"Well, now that you mention it..."
509,00:34:00,00:34:01,Just kidding.
510,00:34:01,00:34:04,"6,000 miles, huh?"
511,00:34:05,00:34:07,"So far, so good."
512,00:34:07,00:34:08,All right.
513,00:34:12,00:34:15,Looks like some paint transfer here.
514,00:34:17,00:34:19,"It's red, like the driver head."
515,00:34:27,00:34:31,Busted graphite shaft.
516,00:34:31,00:34:32,Grip end.
517,00:34:35,00:34:36,No sign of the head.
518,00:34:36,00:34:38,I got some blowflies over here.
519,00:34:40,00:34:43,(camera shutter clicking)
520,00:34:57,00:35:00,"Now, this looks like murder to me."
521,00:35:01,00:35:07,"WILLOWS: We found black and red enamel paint traces in the concrete near the practice tee, consistent with a Fuschida driver head."
522,00:35:08,00:35:13,"We believe that the club broke in the course of a struggle, and that it was used as a weapon to kill Russell Huntley."
523,00:35:13,00:35:14,Hmm.
524,00:35:14,00:35:16,"Well, I didn't do anything to Russell."
525,00:35:16,00:35:19,"Well, you were there."
526,00:35:21,00:35:22,And so was Michelle.
527,00:35:22,00:35:23,She didn't have a thing to do with this.
528,00:35:23,00:35:24,"Well, then tell me what happened."
529,00:35:31,00:35:34,Russell had accused me of cheating.
530,00:35:34,00:35:36,"I break your course record, so I must be cheating, is that it?"
531,00:35:36,00:35:38,You are a jealous old man.
532,00:35:38,00:35:44,"And you're a fraud. And if you got the guts, you meet me at the teaching range in an hour and I'll prove it to you."
533,00:35:47,00:35:51,Try to remember what this game is really about.
534,00:35:51,00:35:54,DANNY: And what it's about is honor.
535,00:35:55,00:35:56,And that's why I had to go.
536,00:35:58,00:35:59,HUNTLEY: That's the best I got.
537,00:36:01,00:36:02,"Not bad, huh?"
538,00:36:02,00:36:04,"All right, that was a new ball."
539,00:36:04,00:36:06,Now I'm gonna do it again with this one.
540,00:36:06,00:36:08,Took this out of your bag in the clubhouse.
541,00:36:08,00:36:12,"This is what you, uh, shot your big 61 with."
542,00:36:18,00:36:20,He said the balls were juiced.
543,00:36:20,00:36:22,"Yeah, they were."
544,00:36:22,00:36:24,Whether you knew it or not.
545,00:36:24,00:36:28,"You know, I switched to new balls the next day, so..."
546,00:36:28,00:36:29,"I don't know, maybe I did know."
547,00:36:29,00:36:32,"On my best day, I was never able to hit it that good."
548,00:36:34,00:36:35,Okay.
549,00:36:35,00:36:36,So then what happened?
550,00:36:36,00:36:38,I left.
551,00:36:38,00:36:41,"You gotta man up and come clean, Danny."
552,00:36:41,00:36:42,"This is insane, all right?"
553,00:36:42,00:36:43,I don't know what you're talking about.
554,00:36:43,00:36:48,"You gotta go to those officials, confess and take the consequences, you hear me?"
555,00:36:48,00:36:50,It's better to lose than to be a cheater.
556,00:36:50,00:36:51,"Go to hell, Dad!"
557,00:36:51,00:36:53,I said I don't know what you're talking about!
558,00:36:53,00:36:55,You gotta tell them!
559,00:36:55,00:36:57,"You hear me, son, you've gotta tell them!"
560,00:36:57,00:36:58,You gotta tell them or I will!
561,00:36:58,00:37:00,You gotta tell them what you did!
562,00:37:00,00:37:03,"You tell them or I will, you hear me?!"
563,00:37:03,00:37:05,So you're saying that he was alive when you left?
564,00:37:05,00:37:07,There wasn't a struggle?
565,00:37:07,00:37:08,I never touched him.
566,00:37:08,00:37:10,"Well, did your stepmother witness anything?"
567,00:37:10,00:37:13,I just saw Michelle driving up as I was leaving.
568,00:37:17,00:37:20,Danny? Danny!
569,00:37:21,00:37:23,(sighing)
570,00:37:23,00:37:26,She would never hurt anyone.
571,00:37:29,00:37:31,"Yes, I did see Danny on his way out of the teaching range."
572,00:37:31,00:37:33,What were you doing up there?
573,00:37:33,00:37:37,"I was just going to hit a few, blow off some steam."
574,00:37:37,00:37:39,It's nice and quiet up there.
575,00:37:39,00:37:43,"But when I saw Danny leaving, I turned around and followed him back to the clubhouse."
576,00:37:43,00:37:45,So you never went to the practice tee?
577,00:37:46,00:37:51,"Listen, uh, I know you want to protect Danny, I understand that."
578,00:37:51,00:37:55,But the best way to protect him is to tell me the truth.
579,00:37:55,00:37:56,I told you before.
580,00:37:56,00:37:59,I don't know what happened to Russell.
581,00:37:59,00:38:01,"Well, I think I do."
582,00:38:01,00:38:08,"I think you went up to the practice tee, and you saw what your stepson had done to his father."
583,00:38:08,00:38:10,Danny?
584,00:38:10,00:38:12,Danny!
585,00:38:16,00:38:19,And you left.
586,00:38:19,00:38:21,You walked away.
587,00:38:21,00:38:25,And you didn't even bother to make an anonymous phone call for help.
588,00:38:26,00:38:29,That never happened.
589,00:38:35,00:38:37,I figure she sees him and leaves.
590,00:38:37,00:38:39,He gets into the cart to try to get help and doesn't make it.
591,00:38:39,00:38:43,"Agreed, but we still have no way to determine who's telling the truth."
592,00:38:43,00:38:45,Either Danny's protecting Michelle or Michelle's protecting Danny.
593,00:38:45,00:38:47,Or the two of them are in on it together.
594,00:38:47,00:38:50,They certainly both had their reasons to want Russell dead.
595,00:38:50,00:38:52,What we need is the murder weapon.
596,00:38:52,00:39:01,"All right, assuming that Russell was stabbed with the broken club head at the teaching range, then the cast-off on the golf cart's roof probably came from when he pulled it out of his neck. Yes."
597,00:39:01,00:39:03,LANGSTON:Since we know where he crashed...
598,00:39:03,00:39:05,WILLOWS: We know where to look.
599,00:39:32,00:39:34,SIDLE:I've got bad news and worse news.
600,00:39:34,00:39:36,Let's hear it.
601,00:39:36,00:39:40,Bad news is the only prints that I recovered from the murder weapon are a match to the victim.
602,00:39:40,00:39:45,So we can't put the murder weapon in the hands of either one of our suspects?
603,00:39:45,00:39:48,It exonerates the both of them.
604,00:39:48,00:39:50,"Yeah, that's the, uh, worse news part."
605,00:39:50,00:39:53,"So, both Danny and Michelle just walk?"
606,00:39:57,00:40:02,"Sara, can you blow up the prints on the grip there, please? Sure."
607,00:40:09,00:40:12,That's a partial palm print.
608,00:40:12,00:40:15,"Nick, you familiar with any of the urban legends about golf?"
609,00:40:15,00:40:17,Vaguely.
610,00:40:17,00:40:19,Look at the orientation of the prints.
611,00:40:21,00:40:23,I think I know what you're getting at.
612,00:40:25,00:40:31,"LANGSTON: When I told the company rep what we were doing, he was more than happy to lend us the robot."
613,00:40:37,00:40:40,"All right, why don't we let the big dog eat?"
614,00:40:42,00:40:47,"You know, Ray, for somebody who doesn't like golf, you certainly seem to know an awful lot about it."
615,00:40:47,00:40:48,It's not that I don't like golf.
616,00:40:49,00:41:01,"It's just that you have to focus your mind, practically every fiber of your being on a small white ball that you want to hit just the right way, and then when you hit it..."
617,00:41:01,00:41:02,the feeling is exhilarating.
618,00:41:03,00:41:09,"And so you chase the small, white ball all day... Mm-hmm."
619,00:41:09,00:41:11,so that you can hit it exactly the same way.
620,00:41:11,00:41:13,You chase that feeling.
621,00:41:13,00:41:14,It's kind of like cocaine.
622,00:41:14,00:41:19,Not exactly the best hobby for an obsessive personality.
623,00:41:19,00:41:24,"Yeah, people like that are better suited for a job in criminalistics, huh?"
624,00:41:26,00:41:28,"Wow, you guys weren't kidding about this thing."
625,00:41:28,00:41:30,That's a lot of technology for smacking golf balls.
626,00:41:30,00:41:32,It can be a serious game.
627,00:41:32,00:41:34,"Okay, so what's your theory?"
628,00:41:34,00:41:39,"What caught our eye were Russell's partial palm prints on the shaft, just below the grip."
629,00:41:39,00:41:45,"Yeah, and when Danny left his dad, he said he was just pounding his club against the ground."
630,00:41:45,00:41:48,LANGSTON: He was mad as hell and he wasn't gonna take it anymore.
631,00:41:57,00:41:58,STOKES: Fore!
632,00:42:00,00:42:01,Oh!
633,00:42:11,00:42:13,"(gasping, gagging)"
634,00:42:13,00:42:16,That's gotta be about a one-in-a-million shot.
635,00:42:16,00:42:17,STOKES: It is.
636,00:42:17,00:42:20,"And believe it or not, it's not just an urban legend."
637,00:42:20,00:42:28,"There are at least four reported cases, worldwide, of golfers who accidentally killed themselves by breaking their clubs."
638,00:42:28,00:42:29,"Well, there's a lesson in that."
639,00:42:29,00:42:30,What?
640,00:42:31,00:42:33,Don't drive angry. Don't drive angry.
