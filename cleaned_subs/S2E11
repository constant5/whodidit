0,00:00:14,00:00:16,You’re going to like my room.
1,00:00:16,00:00:19,You can see the entire Strip from my balcony...
2,00:00:19,00:00:22,and the bed.
3,00:00:22,00:00:24,I usually don’t do this.
4,00:00:24,00:00:27,"I-I mean, especially with somebody that I just met."
5,00:00:27,00:00:29,Yeah?
6,00:00:29,00:00:31,"Well, I could tell that just by looking at you."
7,00:00:31,00:00:32,( elevator bell dings )
8,00:00:32,00:00:35,Uh...
9,00:00:35,00:00:37,"Come on, don’t worry, all right?"
10,00:00:37,00:00:40,You can trust me.
11,00:00:40,00:00:41,Okay?
12,00:00:41,00:00:43,Promise?
13,00:00:43,00:00:45,I never lie.
14,00:00:48,00:00:50,You... are so bad.
15,00:00:50,00:00:51,( laughing )
16,00:00:51,00:00:54,"Yeah, I am."
17,00:00:54,00:00:55,( gasps )
18,00:01:04,00:01:05,( gasps )
19,00:01:07,00:01:08,Hey.
20,00:01:08,00:01:11,Dispatch said suspicious circs.
21,00:01:11,00:01:12,Yeah.
22,00:01:12,00:01:16,We got an anonymous call to 911 at the same time the couple found him.
23,00:01:16,00:01:22,"A male voice said: ""A man has collapsed at the Devon. Hurry."" Where’s the man?"
24,00:01:22,00:01:27,"Well, he was unconscious but breathing so paramedics took him to Desert Palm Hospital."
25,00:01:27,00:01:30,"There was no bullet wounds, no knife... nothing."
26,00:01:30,00:01:31,You got a name?
27,00:01:31,00:01:32,Bob Fairmont.
28,00:01:32,00:01:33,Upscale home developer.
29,00:01:33,00:01:35,"""A Fairmont home, you’ll never roam""?"
30,00:01:35,00:01:36,His billboards are everywhere.
31,00:01:36,00:01:39,They took these pictures before they moved him.
32,00:01:44,00:01:46,"Well, this is as phony as a Chappaquiddick neck brace."
33,00:01:46,00:01:48,The clothes are all bunched.
34,00:01:48,00:01:52,SIDLE: Collar’s off to the side leg fabric’s gathered.
35,00:01:52,00:01:56,It’s impossible to redress an unconscious person to make it look like they dressed themselves.
36,00:01:56,00:01:59,You notice anything about the suit coat?
37,00:02:01,00:02:06,"Well, unless he’s going to court or church there’s no way he buttons all three buttons."
38,00:02:06,00:02:08,"Very good, Jim."
39,00:02:08,00:02:10,Why do they think they can fool us?
40,00:02:45,00:02:47,I’m going to go to the hospital to talk to Fairmont’s wife.
41,00:02:47,00:02:49,( camera shutter clicking )
42,00:02:49,00:02:50,Call me if you learn anything.
43,00:02:50,00:02:52,"Hey, guys."
44,00:02:52,00:02:55,I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant.
45,00:02:55,00:02:58,Bob Fairmont was staying in room 2927.
46,00:02:58,00:03:00,Catherine’s parking the car.
47,00:03:00,00:03:01,Let’s go up.
48,00:03:01,00:03:03,We’ll meet you there.
49,00:03:03,00:03:05,Okay.
50,00:03:12,00:03:15,Mr. Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.
51,00:03:15,00:03:16,Mmm.
52,00:03:16,00:03:17,Murder Central?
53,00:03:17,00:03:18,You never heard that phrase?
54,00:03:18,00:03:21,"Well, if I did, would I have asked the question?"
55,00:03:21,00:03:22,"Sara, you’re with me in here."
56,00:03:22,00:03:24,You guys get the elevator.
57,00:03:25,00:03:26,"All yours, girl."
58,00:03:26,00:03:28,Thanks.
59,00:03:31,00:03:35,Sara doesn’t know what Murder Central means any more than I do.
60,00:03:35,00:03:36,"Oh, Nick, give it up."
61,00:03:36,00:03:39,We got a Death Imminent to worry about.
62,00:03:40,00:03:41,My husband’s in surgery.
63,00:03:41,00:03:43,Can’t this wait?
64,00:03:43,00:03:45,"I’m sorry, no."
65,00:03:45,00:03:47,He was found under suspicious circumstances.
66,00:03:47,00:03:50,Do you have any idea who may have redressed him or moved him?
67,00:03:50,00:03:53,He usually goes with women who look a lot like me...
68,00:03:53,00:03:55,only younger.
69,00:03:56,00:04:00,"And I’m embarrassed to say that I’ve been flattered by that, at times."
70,00:04:00,00:04:03,Do you have a name?
71,00:04:03,00:04:06,I was very much on the outside of that part of his life.
72,00:04:08,00:04:10,I see.
73,00:04:19,00:04:21,I know. The room’s talking to us.
74,00:04:21,00:04:24,They had champagne.
75,00:04:24,00:04:27,They were celebrating something.
76,00:04:32,00:04:34,No lipstick on either glass.
77,00:04:34,00:04:38,911 did say it was a man’s voice that placed the call.
78,00:04:40,00:04:42,Smell the musk?
79,00:04:42,00:04:44,Hint of bleach?
80,00:04:48,00:04:50,Sexual intercourse.
81,00:04:53,00:04:54,They kept the drapes open.
82,00:04:54,00:04:57,A married man who’s not worried about...
83,00:04:57,00:05:00,"photographs, long lenses..."
84,00:05:00,00:05:05,"Well, he’s either careless or arrogant, maybe."
85,00:05:05,00:05:06,Or he has a death wish.
86,00:05:15,00:05:18,34 C?
87,00:05:18,00:05:23,If he was with a woman who was the guy on the 911 call?
88,00:05:25,00:05:27,Hand me that magnifier.
89,00:05:27,00:05:30,Thank you.
90,00:05:30,00:05:32,What do you got?
91,00:05:32,00:05:34,See those white specks?
92,00:05:37,00:05:39,"What do you think, cocaine?"
93,00:05:39,00:05:42,"No, I don’t think so."
94,00:05:42,00:05:44,How can you tell just by looking?
95,00:05:46,00:05:48,Never you mind.
96,00:05:55,00:05:58,Let’s just get this to Trace.
97,00:06:02,00:06:04,"Okay, we’re done in the elevator."
98,00:06:04,00:06:06,You guys need a hand?
99,00:06:06,00:06:09,"Yeah, you want to dust the champagne bottle?"
100,00:06:09,00:06:14,The average American hotel room is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.
101,00:06:14,00:06:16,"Yeah, but they’re not all biological."
102,00:06:16,00:06:20,"Some are soda stains, food stains, whiskey stains, you know."
103,00:06:20,00:06:26,No matter how clean or expensive the room seems that why I always travel with Nonoxinol Nine.
104,00:06:26,00:06:29,You sound like you’re making a commercial.
105,00:06:29,00:06:31,"Nick, hit the lights, will you?"
106,00:06:33,00:06:36,"Okay, we’re looking for the freshest stains."
107,00:06:38,00:06:40,"Soda, maybe..."
108,00:06:40,00:06:41,Maybe champagne...
109,00:06:41,00:06:43,Oh! Someone’s little soldiers...
110,00:06:43,00:06:47,"not fresh, dry."
111,00:06:47,00:06:50,More champagne.
112,00:06:57,00:06:59,GRISSOM: Hmm...
113,00:06:59,00:07:08,"""Starlight, star bright, First star I see tonight."" Okay, I’ll let you guys do the collection."
114,00:07:09,00:07:10,Thanks a lot.
115,00:07:10,00:07:12,"Oh, and Sara?"
116,00:07:12,00:07:13,Hmm.
117,00:07:13,00:07:21,"Last hotel room nearest the stairwell-- easy entry and egress for an intruder and if the victim fights back, 50% less chance of being heard."
118,00:07:23,00:07:26,Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.
119,00:07:31,00:07:33,( door closes )
120,00:07:33,00:07:35,You are so busted.
121,00:07:49,00:07:50,I gave this to Trace.
122,00:07:50,00:07:52,Why do you have it?
123,00:07:52,00:07:54,"SANDERS: Well, because I deal in DNA."
124,00:07:54,00:07:57,The smallest sliver of epidermal tissue.
125,00:07:57,00:07:58,This is skin.
126,00:07:58,00:08:01,Scalp skin.
127,00:08:01,00:08:02,Itchy.
128,00:08:02,00:08:07,Can be embarrassing in social situations especially if one is wearing a dark shirt.
129,00:08:07,00:08:08,Dandruff.
130,00:08:10,00:08:13,Good chance whoever moved the guy into the elevator...
131,00:08:13,00:08:15,Had a bad case of seborrhea.
132,00:08:17,00:08:19,Thanks.
133,00:08:19,00:08:21,"Hey, Catherine."
134,00:08:21,00:08:24,Do you think Sara would ever go out with me?
135,00:08:24,00:08:26,Sure.
136,00:08:26,00:08:29,As long as you don’t tell her it’s a date.
137,00:08:29,00:08:30,"BROWN: Hey, Cath..."
138,00:08:30,00:08:33,are you on this Fairmont case?
139,00:08:33,00:08:35,House mogul caught with his pants on?
140,00:08:35,00:08:38,"Yeah, I’m just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?"
141,00:08:38,00:08:41,You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?
142,00:08:41,00:08:43,You serious? For what?
143,00:08:43,00:08:44,Shots fired.
144,00:08:44,00:08:47,He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.
145,00:08:47,00:08:48,Wow!
146,00:08:48,00:08:52,Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I’m wondering if that’s what really happened.
147,00:08:52,00:08:54,I’m going to pull his file and check it out.
148,00:08:54,00:08:56,Let me know.
149,00:08:56,00:08:57,I will.
150,00:08:57,00:08:59,STOKES: Nice shot.
151,00:08:59,00:09:02,Reservoir’s still wet.
152,00:09:02,00:09:03,Why did he throw it?
153,00:09:03,00:09:06,Mmm. I’m only impressed if he aimed.
154,00:09:06,00:09:09,I wonder if the woman has any idea she left her DNA behind?
155,00:09:09,00:09:12,"Not rocket science. Man’s inside, woman’s out."
156,00:09:14,00:09:15,Wife says the guy’s a player.
157,00:09:15,00:09:16,She doesn’t know the women.
158,00:09:16,00:09:18,You tell her about the 911 tape?
159,00:09:18,00:09:20,The male voice?
160,00:09:20,00:09:21,"Oh, I just got back from Central Dispatch."
161,00:09:21,00:09:23,The tape’s lost. New computer system.
162,00:09:23,00:09:25,Any ear-witnesses?
163,00:09:25,00:09:27,The dispatcher says it could’ve been a woman whispering.
164,00:09:27,00:09:32,"Or a very old person, gender indeterminate."
165,00:09:32,00:09:34,That’s about as good as an eyewitness.
166,00:09:34,00:09:36,( phone ringing )
167,00:09:38,00:09:39,Grissom.
168,00:09:39,00:09:41,What?
169,00:09:41,00:09:43,I’ll be right there.
170,00:09:44,00:09:47,No lunch.
171,00:09:47,00:09:48,GRISSOM: We got a time?
172,00:09:48,00:09:52,"Well, all indications are he was brain-dead from the time he collapsed at the hotel."
173,00:09:52,00:09:53,From?
174,00:09:53,00:09:57,An artery out-pouches blood floods the subarachnoid space.
175,00:09:57,00:10:00,"Heart still beats, but the brain’s dead."
176,00:10:00,00:10:02,And it doesn’t regenerate.
177,00:10:02,00:10:05,Aneurysm from trauma... infection...?
178,00:10:05,00:10:07,Genetic predisposition. Both parents went that way.
179,00:10:07,00:10:11,It increases a person’s chance of stroke ten-fold.
180,00:10:11,00:10:13,He looks like an athlete.
181,00:10:13,00:10:15,"Brain dead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong."
182,00:10:17,00:10:18,Is this a Frankenstein?
183,00:10:18,00:10:21,I was wondering when you’d ask.
184,00:10:21,00:10:24,Prime donor candidate.
185,00:10:24,00:10:25,Next of kin signed off.
186,00:10:25,00:10:26,How many organs they take?
187,00:10:26,00:10:28,Eight in under two hours.
188,00:10:28,00:10:30,"Man, those harvest doctors move, don’t they?"
189,00:10:30,00:10:32,"Stat! Go, go, go!"
190,00:10:32,00:10:34,"Here comes the liver. Ready with a basin, please."
191,00:10:34,00:10:35,Right now.
192,00:10:35,00:10:37,And here we go.
193,00:10:37,00:10:38,( steady tone )
194,00:10:38,00:10:40,"Clamp it. Get it back, get it back."
195,00:10:40,00:10:42,Ready and got it. Here we go.
196,00:10:42,00:10:45,"All right, I’ll notify the PD about the organs."
197,00:10:50,00:10:53,So I was thinking...
198,00:10:53,00:10:58,maybe we could take our break at the same time.
199,00:10:58,00:11:00,Later this shift.
200,00:11:00,00:11:02,Together.
201,00:11:02,00:11:03,Sure.
202,00:11:03,00:11:05,Really.
203,00:11:10,00:11:12,Semen. No surprise there.
204,00:11:12,00:11:18,"Well, without the DNA sample from the hotel guy this test is pretty useless."
205,00:11:18,00:11:21,I’m more interested...
206,00:11:21,00:11:23,in who the woman is.
207,00:11:23,00:11:29,"Well, just like the bra, I’m going to need a reference of her DNA in order to do anything, and that’s not going to happen until-- What the heck?"
208,00:11:29,00:11:31,What?
209,00:11:31,00:11:32,Stripes.
210,00:11:35,00:11:37,Stripes.
211,00:11:37,00:11:41,Transverse white bands that appear six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.
212,00:11:41,00:11:43,You got a closer view?
213,00:11:43,00:11:45,Uh...
214,00:11:50,00:11:53,They look like Mees lines to me.
215,00:11:53,00:11:54,Could be livor mortis.
216,00:11:54,00:11:57,"Or white striae, indicative of heavy metal poisoning."
217,00:11:57,00:12:00,We can’t count on a photo to draw that kind of conclusion.
218,00:12:00,00:12:01,We need the body.
219,00:12:03,00:12:05,"Don’t take this wrong, Dr. Robbins, but..."
220,00:12:05,00:12:09,how do you release a body that’s been redressed and dumped in an elevator?
221,00:12:09,00:12:18,"I deal with cause of death, which was an aneurysm and therefore, a Natural, and based on that his body is released to a mortuary."
222,00:12:18,00:12:21,The whole transplant thing didn’t raise a flag?
223,00:12:21,00:12:26,I thought I’d raised a flag with the good doctor when I told him I was going to notify the police department.
224,00:12:26,00:12:29,"But evidently, I miscommunicated again."
225,00:12:29,00:12:31,Great.
226,00:12:31,00:12:33,( typing )
227,00:12:33,00:12:35,( beeping )
228,00:12:35,00:12:37,All may not be lost. Here...
229,00:12:37,00:12:44,Body of Robert Fairmont released at 0400 hours to the Desert Haven Mortuary.
230,00:12:44,00:12:45,I know that place.
231,00:12:45,00:12:49,"Well, if they haven’t embalmed him we can still get a blood sample, test for heavy metal poisoning."
232,00:12:49,00:12:51,Good. I’ll drive.
233,00:12:53,00:12:55,You’re not coming?
234,00:12:55,00:12:57,"You found it, you run with it."
235,00:12:58,00:13:01,You can do it. Take Nick.
236,00:13:01,00:13:03,Okay.
237,00:13:07,00:13:09,How long’s he been in here?
238,00:13:09,00:13:12,"92 minutes at 1,600 degrees."
239,00:13:12,00:13:14,What exactly was it that you wanted to see?
240,00:13:14,00:13:15,His fingernails.
241,00:13:15,00:13:16,I’m very sorry.
242,00:13:16,00:13:18,Who approved this cremation?
243,00:13:18,00:13:20,( sighing )
244,00:13:20,00:13:22,"His wife, Julia Fairmont."
245,00:13:22,00:13:25,Same person who approved the organ transplants.
246,00:13:31,00:13:33,( flames crackling )
247,00:13:47,00:13:50,BRASS: You told me your husband was in surgery.
248,00:13:50,00:13:52,He was.
249,00:13:52,00:13:56,Surgery to take his organs not to save his life.
250,00:13:56,00:13:59,He was technically... dead.
251,00:13:59,00:14:01,He wanted to donate his organs.
252,00:14:01,00:14:04,I was following his wishes.
253,00:14:04,00:14:07,Why are you being so hostile?
254,00:14:07,00:14:10,Someone was poisoning your husband.
255,00:14:10,00:14:11,What?
256,00:14:12,00:14:18,We don’t know the dose or the duration but we do know the type of poison.
257,00:14:18,00:14:21,We processed your husband’s remains.
258,00:14:21,00:14:26,Most poisons would be completely burned off by cremation but heavy metals are very resistant to heat.
259,00:14:29,00:14:32,This heavy metal is called selenium.
260,00:14:32,00:14:36,Did you notice that your husband’s breath might have been garlicky?
261,00:14:36,00:14:38,Garlicky?
262,00:14:38,00:14:42,The body will excrete demethyl selenide-- smells just like garlic.
263,00:14:42,00:14:46,Uh... no.
264,00:14:46,00:14:49,The white stripes on his fingernails-- did you notice those?
265,00:14:49,00:14:51,Um...
266,00:14:51,00:14:54,We didn’t see each other a lot.
267,00:14:54,00:14:56,Bob was busy building his company.
268,00:14:56,00:14:59,"That bother you, him never being home?"
269,00:15:02,00:15:05,I think it would bother any woman.
270,00:15:07,00:15:11,Did you know that the most common choice of premeditated murder among women is poison?
271,00:15:11,00:15:13,They cite its passivity.
272,00:15:15,00:15:18,I did not poison my husband.
273,00:15:18,00:15:20,You cremated his body.
274,00:15:20,00:15:23,He wanted to be cremated. I cremated him.
275,00:15:23,00:15:25,"He wanted to donate his organs. I did that, too."
276,00:15:25,00:15:29,"Now, if there’s nothing else, I will be at home preparing for my husband’s memorial service."
277,00:15:29,00:15:31,Excuse me.
278,00:15:31,00:15:35,Do you want us to notify you?
279,00:15:35,00:15:37,Of what?
280,00:15:37,00:15:43,When we find out the exact amount of selenium given to your husband and over what period of time?
281,00:15:43,00:15:46,I thought you couldn’t tell.
282,00:15:46,00:15:49,"Your husband’s gone, but his organs are still out there."
283,00:15:49,00:15:51,"Well, good."
284,00:15:51,00:15:55,"Yes, I would like to be notified."
285,00:16:01,00:16:03,"Straight up, am I going to die?"
286,00:16:03,00:16:07,You have only a small fraction of the poison that was in your donor’s body-- one organ.
287,00:16:07,00:16:10,With nothing new coming in it should work its way out.
288,00:16:10,00:16:13,I must’ve had 100 tests.
289,00:16:13,00:16:15,How’d you doctors miss this?
290,00:16:15,00:16:19,A heavy metal like selenium presents so rarely that it’s not part of our screening protocol.
291,00:16:21,00:16:24,You don’t look like a doctor.
292,00:16:24,00:16:25,"No, sir, no, I’m not."
293,00:16:25,00:16:27,I’m Nick Stokes.
294,00:16:27,00:16:28,I’m with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
295,00:16:28,00:16:30,I’ll be right outside.
296,00:16:30,00:16:32,"Thank you, Doctor."
297,00:16:34,00:16:38,I was hoping I might be able to get a sample of that new kidney of yours.
298,00:16:38,00:16:40,A sample?
299,00:16:40,00:16:41,Biopsy. A sliver.
300,00:16:41,00:16:43,You mean open me up again?
301,00:16:43,00:16:47,Maybe an invasive scope.
302,00:16:47,00:16:52,The only way I can get an accurate barometer of the poison in Mr. Fairmont’s system is through one of his organs.
303,00:16:52,00:16:57,"I’m sorry, young man, but this is my kidney now."
304,00:16:57,00:16:59,I waited four years.
305,00:16:59,00:17:02,I can’t have anyone cut into me for it.
306,00:17:02,00:17:03,I just can’t.
307,00:17:03,00:17:07,"No, hey, I understand."
308,00:17:07,00:17:09,Thank you for your time.
309,00:17:11,00:17:13,"I like your watch, man, that’s cool."
310,00:17:13,00:17:18,It broke while I was down in surgery-- stuck on 11:00.
311,00:17:18,00:17:20,Think the Lord’s trying to tell me something?
312,00:17:20,00:17:22,( chuckles )
313,00:17:22,00:17:24,"Yeah, get it to a watch repair shop."
314,00:17:27,00:17:31,"I hope you get to feeling better, Mr. Mercer."
315,00:17:42,00:17:43,Nick struck out on the kidney.
316,00:17:43,00:17:45,I got four no’s over the phone.
317,00:17:45,00:17:48,One yes from a recipient in Illinois--heart.
318,00:17:48,00:17:51,Useless--heart has no memory for poison.
319,00:17:51,00:17:55,Why can’t we cut the middle man and just check the wife’s house for selenium?
320,00:17:55,00:17:58,"All right, I know, something about Constitutional law."
321,00:17:58,00:18:00,"Get probable cause, then get a search warrant..."
322,00:18:00,00:18:03,Sara! I was just looking for you.
323,00:18:03,00:18:05,Still up for break?
324,00:18:05,00:18:07,"Sorry, Greggo. Hot case."
325,00:18:07,00:18:09,I’m going to go look at Nick’s champagne bottle.
326,00:18:09,00:18:11,How you doing with our DNA?
327,00:18:11,00:18:17,Uh... inside-outside we’re still looking for a reference for comparison but the epidermals are looking promising.
328,00:18:17,00:18:19,Nice.
329,00:18:19,00:18:21,You want to clue me in?
330,00:18:21,00:18:24,Sara and I were just going out for dinner.
331,00:18:24,00:18:26,"On the case, Greggo."
332,00:18:26,00:18:29,Oh. Right.
333,00:18:34,00:18:35,Excuse me...
334,00:18:35,00:18:38,"I’m Claudia Gideon, Bob Fairmont’s secretary."
335,00:18:38,00:18:39,I came to pick up his property.
336,00:18:39,00:18:42,"NURSE: Oh, I’m sorry, but Ms. Willows already asked for them."
337,00:18:42,00:18:45,His property is part of our investigation.
338,00:18:45,00:18:47,I’m afraid I have to take it.
339,00:18:47,00:18:48,"Oh, fine. I was just doing my job."
340,00:18:48,00:18:50,"Yeah, me, too."
341,00:18:50,00:18:54,"Did you work for the Fairmonts three years ago, when Mr. Fairmont was shot?"
342,00:18:54,00:18:56,I was out sick that day.
343,00:18:56,00:18:58,Interesting.
344,00:18:59,00:19:02,You have dandruff.
345,00:19:02,00:19:06,Is that really proper etiquette?
346,00:19:06,00:19:08,It is when I’m on a case.
347,00:19:08,00:19:10,You mind?
348,00:19:14,00:19:16,Where did you say you worked?
349,00:19:18,00:19:23,BRASS: I’m going to ask you again-- were you in that hotel room with Bob Fairmont?
350,00:19:23,00:19:25,"I was not, no."
351,00:19:25,00:19:28,But you did redress him and place him in the elevator.
352,00:19:28,00:19:30,You don’t know what you’re talking about.
353,00:19:30,00:19:33,"Well, that’s dangerous to say to a scientist."
354,00:19:34,00:19:38,Dandruff is nothing more than sloughed-off skin.
355,00:19:38,00:19:43,It has a nucleus just like a cell on your arm or your big toe.
356,00:19:43,00:19:52,These 13 DNA markers from this dandruff cell are a match to the dandruff that I recovered from your sweater.
357,00:19:52,00:19:54,You were there.
358,00:19:54,00:19:56,At the hotel.
359,00:20:01,00:20:03,Okay.
360,00:20:03,00:20:10,"Mr. Fairmont told me earlier that day to meet him in his hotel room at 9:00 to pick up some papers, okay?"
361,00:20:10,00:20:14,"When I got there, he was in bed-- naked, unconscious."
362,00:20:14,00:20:19,He always told me reputation before health-- no scandals.
363,00:20:19,00:20:21,I dragged him to the elevator.
364,00:20:28,00:20:32,Let me guess-- you snuck out down the stairwell.
365,00:20:33,00:20:35,Who was Fairmont partying with in that room?
366,00:20:35,00:20:37,I don’t know.
367,00:20:37,00:20:44,"Well, we won’t mind if we compare your DNA to the vaginal contribution of a condom that we recovered from Mr. Fairmont’s room?"
368,00:20:44,00:20:46,"Sure, go ahead. Good."
369,00:20:46,00:20:54,We’d like to show you something else-- about that accidental shooting three years ago at your boss’ house.
370,00:20:54,00:20:59,WARRICK: In this reenactment Fairmont shot himself while cleaning his gun.
371,00:21:01,00:21:02,The story just doesn’t add up.
372,00:21:02,00:21:10,I think I fell for it because I was new and I wasn’t too eager to talk to another guy about him almost shooting off his manhood.
373,00:21:12,00:21:17,This is the room as it was then based off of my crime scene photos.
374,00:21:17,00:21:21,"This is crime scene reconstruction, new school."
375,00:21:21,00:21:23,"Works backward, reverse time."
376,00:21:23,00:21:25,The bullet hit here.
377,00:21:27,00:21:35,"The only logical place for that bullet to have been shot from is four meters away, one meter high."
378,00:21:35,00:21:39,He didn’t accidentally shoot himself.
379,00:21:39,00:21:40,Someone shot him.
380,00:21:40,00:21:41,We’re thinking it was you.
381,00:21:43,00:21:46,"The admission form from the ER, 9/6/98."
382,00:21:46,00:21:50,The person who brought Fairmont in on the accidental shooting...
383,00:21:50,00:21:53,was you.
384,00:21:53,00:21:56,I didn’t shoot him.
385,00:21:56,00:21:57,"You didn’t poison him, either."
386,00:21:57,00:21:59,All these bad things just happen to you.
387,00:21:59,00:22:02,"I’m on call 24 hours a day, okay?"
388,00:22:02,00:22:04,Mr. Fairmont beeped me.
389,00:22:04,00:22:06,"I drove out to the house, and I took him in."
390,00:22:06,00:22:08,Where was his wife?
391,00:22:11,00:22:14,You’d have to ask her.
392,00:22:14,00:22:15,"Yes, I shot him."
393,00:22:15,00:22:20,He was supposed to go riding with me and he didn’t show up until 2:00 in the morning.
394,00:22:20,00:22:22,"No calls, nothing."
395,00:22:22,00:22:25,I was... hurt.
396,00:22:25,00:22:31,"So, you just sat there in the dark and aimed south of his belt."
397,00:22:31,00:22:33,I just wanted to scare him.
398,00:22:33,00:22:35,It was a business meeting.
399,00:22:35,00:22:36,I swear.
400,00:22:36,00:22:38,I-It wasn’t like before.
401,00:22:38,00:22:41,I was thinking about you the whole time.
402,00:22:41,00:22:43,"So, why didn’t you tell the truth then?"
403,00:22:43,00:22:46,"I wanted to, but Bob wouldn’t let me."
404,00:22:46,00:22:49,He said that it would ruin his career-- Fairmont Family Estates.
405,00:22:49,00:22:54,"WARRICK: I’m presenting this case to the D.A., even if it is three years old."
406,00:22:54,00:22:55,My husband’s dead.
407,00:22:55,00:22:59,We had our problems but I loved him.
408,00:22:59,00:23:02,I don’t... I don’t much care what you do now.
409,00:23:02,00:23:04,"Well, there’s only two reasons a woman shoots a man."
410,00:23:04,00:23:06,She either loves him or hates him.
411,00:23:06,00:23:07,Or both.
412,00:23:11,00:23:17,And that’s the sample Catherine pulled off of the secretary’s blouse and the hotel man’s clothes-- same source.
413,00:23:17,00:23:18,Secretary moved the body.
414,00:23:18,00:23:20,We just interviewed her.
415,00:23:20,00:23:21,She copped to moving him.
416,00:23:21,00:23:23,We’re looking hard at the wife on the poisoning.
417,00:23:23,00:23:26,The secretary has dandruff.
418,00:23:26,00:23:27,We know.
419,00:23:27,00:23:30,Dermatomycoses seborrhea-- we got it.
420,00:23:30,00:23:33,Topical eczemas like that require prescription medication.
421,00:23:33,00:23:38,The primary ingredient of those medications-- selenium sulfide.
422,00:23:38,00:23:41,JULIA: I don’t really feel right about doing this.
423,00:23:41,00:23:43,"Oh, this is your residence."
424,00:23:43,00:23:45,Everything in Claudia’s office is your property.
425,00:23:45,00:23:47,She could be back from dinner at any moment.
426,00:23:47,00:23:49,This shouldn’t take long.
427,00:23:49,00:23:51,( door closes )
428,00:24:26,00:24:27,( door opens )
429,00:24:27,00:24:29,That’s mine.
430,00:24:29,00:24:34,BRASS: Could you tell us why you keep your shampoo in your office?
431,00:24:34,00:24:38,WILLOWS: Shampoo full of the same poison found in Bob Fairmont’s remains?
432,00:24:38,00:24:39,I don’t know.
433,00:24:39,00:24:41,"Aw, you have to do better than that."
434,00:24:41,00:24:45,CLAUDIA: Maybe I picked it up at the pharmacy on lunch and put it there.
435,00:24:45,00:24:46,I don’t know.
436,00:24:56,00:24:59,Cream cheese.
437,00:24:59,00:25:01,( Claudia scoffs )
438,00:25:01,00:25:02,Garlic cream cheese.
439,00:25:02,00:25:04,Hides the bitter aftertaste.
440,00:25:11,00:25:15,It explains away his bad breath.
441,00:25:15,00:25:17,( laughing )
442,00:25:17,00:25:18,I did not poison him.
443,00:25:18,00:25:20,( cabinet door closes )
444,00:25:20,00:25:21,We’ll see.
445,00:25:23,00:25:25,Aren’t you going to arrest her?
446,00:25:25,00:25:26,( scoffs )
447,00:25:26,00:25:27,I haven’t done anything.
448,00:25:27,00:25:29,Other than poison Bob.
449,00:25:29,00:25:30,Poison?
450,00:25:30,00:25:32,I’m the one who looked out for him.
451,00:25:32,00:25:33,You? I ran his home.
452,00:25:33,00:25:35,I entertained his clients.
453,00:25:35,00:25:37,"Who made all of his dental appointments, huh?"
454,00:25:37,00:25:40,His haircuts? Who got his taxes in on time?
455,00:25:40,00:25:41,Covered for his mistresses.
456,00:25:41,00:25:45,Oh... why did he need mistresses?
457,00:25:45,00:25:46,BRASS: Ladies...
458,00:25:46,00:25:47,don’t go there.
459,00:25:50,00:25:51,This is yours...
460,00:25:51,00:25:52,and these are yours.
461,00:25:52,00:25:54,There’s the door.
462,00:25:54,00:25:57,We build a case before we make any arrests.
463,00:25:57,00:25:59,( monitor beeping rhythmically )
464,00:26:01,00:26:02,"Hey, Mr. Mercer."
465,00:26:02,00:26:04,I got your message.
466,00:26:04,00:26:06,You wanted to talk to me?
467,00:26:06,00:26:09,Did you find out who poisoned Mr. Fairmont?
468,00:26:09,00:26:10,No.
469,00:26:10,00:26:16,"No, sir. I have found selenium in his office but... without actually knowing how much was in his system..."
470,00:26:16,00:26:19,What if I could tell you?
471,00:26:19,00:26:21,My body’s rejecting the organ.
472,00:26:21,00:26:23,Doctor says it’s got nothing to do with poison.
473,00:26:23,00:26:24,It’s antibodies.
474,00:26:24,00:26:27,( sniffles )
475,00:26:27,00:26:28,I’m sorry.
476,00:26:28,00:26:33,I told you this watch stopped while I was down in surgery?
477,00:26:33,00:26:35,It’s funny...
478,00:26:35,00:26:39,it’s like it knew all along the kidney wasn’t going to take.
479,00:26:39,00:26:46,Anyway... there’s one last good thing I can do before I leave this earth.
480,00:26:46,00:26:49,So... how do we do this?
481,00:26:54,00:26:59,I can’t even talk Warrick into splitting a sandwich with me and this guy’s willing to give us his kidney?
482,00:26:59,00:27:00,You asked for it.
483,00:27:00,00:27:01,"Yeah, that’s my point."
484,00:27:01,00:27:07,Carl Mercer risks dying sooner to help our investigation but who protects his rights?
485,00:27:07,00:27:10,He has free will.
486,00:27:10,00:27:11,"Well, so do I."
487,00:27:11,00:27:13,I want to retract our request.
488,00:27:13,00:27:16,I don’t think any investigation for the dead is worth hurting the living.
489,00:27:20,00:27:22,What?
490,00:27:22,00:27:23,SIDLE: Guys?
491,00:27:23,00:27:25,You’re not going to believe this.
492,00:27:25,00:27:26,Funny.
493,00:27:26,00:27:29,Sometimes it is the simplest things that seem so difficult.
494,00:27:29,00:27:32,I’ve been trying to match the partial from the champagne bottle to these known prints.
495,00:27:32,00:27:34,It was upside down.
496,00:27:36,00:27:37,( computer beeps )
497,00:27:41,00:27:47,Must’ve grabbed the bottle... upside-down to pour.
498,00:27:51,00:27:52,( beeps )
499,00:27:52,00:27:54,( keyboard clacking )
500,00:27:56,00:27:58,( computer beeps twice )
501,00:27:58,00:28:00,So...
502,00:28:00,00:28:01,who was he with?
503,00:28:01,00:28:03,Mrs. Fairmont.
504,00:28:03,00:28:07,What? Player was in the hotel cheating with his own wife?
505,00:28:07,00:28:11,I was trying to... rekindle our marriage.
506,00:28:11,00:28:15,I... got the room... brought the champagne.
507,00:28:15,00:28:17,"Oh, yes."
508,00:28:17,00:28:18,Yes.
509,00:28:18,00:28:21,He squeezed me in between business meetings at the hotel.
510,00:28:21,00:28:25,And you didn’t think to tell me that when we first talked?
511,00:28:25,00:28:29,"No, because you asked me about him being redressed in an elevator..."
512,00:28:29,00:28:35,"and, besides, when I left him, he was... alive watching the news."
513,00:28:35,00:28:37,( television news playing )
514,00:28:42,00:28:45,"Oh, so, he had a stroke alone, after you left."
515,00:28:45,00:28:48,( groaning )
516,00:28:49,00:28:50,I’m not a doctor.
517,00:28:50,00:28:52,I don’t know when he had it.
518,00:28:52,00:28:55,"BRASS: Well, CSI is testing that champagne bottle for selenium."
519,00:28:55,00:28:58,I didn’t think poison caused strokes.
520,00:28:58,00:29:02,You seem to know a lot about poison for not being a doctor.
521,00:29:04,00:29:09,I know a lot of things about a lot of things but that doesn’t mean that I killed my husband.
522,00:29:12,00:29:16,Yeah... but what never lies?
523,00:29:18,00:29:20,Fairmont had three gold crowns.
524,00:29:20,00:29:23,They should’ve survived the cremation.
525,00:29:23,00:29:27,"At least partially. Heavy metal, after all."
526,00:29:27,00:29:30,SIDLE: His wife...
527,00:29:30,00:29:32,had them removed at the mortuary.
528,00:29:32,00:29:37,"That adds new meaning to the phrase ""gold digger."" Actually, that’s how the phrase got started."
529,00:29:37,00:29:40,People used to dig up the bodies to extract the gold.
530,00:29:40,00:29:41,Now they just marry them.
531,00:29:41,00:29:46,"In some countries, this would be enough to have her arrested for murdering her husband."
532,00:29:46,00:29:50,What’s the most important component in a poisoning?
533,00:29:50,00:29:53,Poison.
534,00:29:53,00:29:54,Patience.
535,00:29:57,00:29:59,( moaning softly )
536,00:30:03,00:30:05,Ms. Fairmont...
537,00:30:05,00:30:06,"Ms. Fairmont, you feeling okay?"
538,00:30:06,00:30:07,"Yeah, I’m, I’m..."
539,00:30:07,00:30:09,( groaning )
540,00:30:09,00:30:10,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
541,00:30:10,00:30:12,Hey... Maybe I just need to sit down... for a minute.
542,00:30:12,00:30:15,"Yeah, yeah, let’s sit down here in the car for a sec."
543,00:30:17,00:30:20,"There you go. Relax, relax, relax."
544,00:30:20,00:30:23,( beeping )
545,00:30:23,00:30:24,"Yeah, I need an ambulance."
546,00:30:24,00:30:26,"Uh, Vegas PD, west parking lot."
547,00:30:51,00:30:52,( keyboard clacking )
548,00:30:52,00:30:54,"Hey, what’s going on?"
549,00:30:54,00:30:55,We called the hospital.
550,00:30:55,00:30:57,She’s been released.
551,00:30:57,00:30:59,ER doc gave her a shot of Hydropazeen...
552,00:30:59,00:31:00,sent her on her way.
553,00:31:00,00:31:01,Hydropazeen?
554,00:31:01,00:31:06,That’s an antiemetic used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.
555,00:31:06,00:31:10,Which means... somebody’s been poisoning our suspect.
556,00:31:10,00:31:13,I don’t know how it happened.
557,00:31:13,00:31:15,Maybe she poisoned herself.
558,00:31:15,00:31:17,Why would she do that?
559,00:31:17,00:31:20,Why would she hide my shampoo in my office?
560,00:31:20,00:31:21,"What, you know she did that?"
561,00:31:21,00:31:22,"Well, it wasn’t her husband."
562,00:31:22,00:31:24,He was already dead.
563,00:31:24,00:31:26,She’s trying to frame me for killing him.
564,00:31:26,00:31:29,"I mean, do you have anything beyond your suspicions that she did kill him?"
565,00:31:29,00:31:31,She had his gold fillings removed.
566,00:31:31,00:31:34,Doesn’t that tell you something about her?
567,00:31:35,00:31:38,"I had his watch and ring removed, too."
568,00:31:38,00:31:40,Do you want to see them?
569,00:31:40,00:31:41,They’re in a box at home.
570,00:31:41,00:31:44,You realize that doesn’t look good?
571,00:31:44,00:31:45,It can look however it wants.
572,00:31:45,00:31:47,I have nothing to hide.
573,00:31:47,00:31:49,You mean since you yourself have been poisoned?
574,00:31:49,00:31:51,"Yeah, why aren’t you asking Claudia Richards about that?"
575,00:31:51,00:31:53,"First my husband, then me?"
576,00:31:53,00:31:55,Why would she want to kill either one of you?
577,00:31:55,00:31:57,I don’t know.
578,00:31:59,00:32:02,Maybe because he refused...
579,00:32:02,00:32:05,to leave me for her.
580,00:32:05,00:32:08,I had to wash his grungy coffee mug every night.
581,00:32:08,00:32:11,I had to clean his toenail clippings off of his desktop.
582,00:32:11,00:32:14,Why would I ever ask Bob Fairmont to leave anyone for me?
583,00:32:14,00:32:17,"So, you think it was all in Mrs. Fairmont’s head?"
584,00:32:17,00:32:20,He always said she was crazy.
585,00:32:20,00:32:22,"Okay, that’s it. All right..."
586,00:32:22,00:32:25,"Look, we’re not leaving here till we get to the bottom of this."
587,00:32:25,00:32:28,Then I hope she talks soon.
588,00:32:35,00:32:37,( printer whirring )
589,00:32:39,00:32:40,Greg?
590,00:32:40,00:32:42,Hey.
591,00:32:42,00:32:46,I was just printing something out for you on your hot case.
592,00:32:46,00:32:48,From the Internet?
593,00:32:48,00:32:50,"SANDERS: Yeah, I..."
594,00:32:50,00:32:52,"I was... on break, had some time..."
595,00:32:52,00:32:54,"thought, hey..."
596,00:32:56,00:32:59,"Sorry, I drew a blank on the wife."
597,00:32:59,00:33:04,"I could really, really just kiss you right now."
598,00:33:13,00:33:15,"GRISSOM: So, this is Claudia."
599,00:33:15,00:33:20,"SIDLE: Ten years ago, her husband, John Gideon."
600,00:33:24,00:33:27,Claudia’s rich husband also died young-- 35.
601,00:33:27,00:33:32,She donated his organs and cremated his body.
602,00:33:32,00:33:33,We don’t have to chase down these organs.
603,00:33:33,00:33:38,Ralph Parks rejected the organ that he got from Claudia’s husband.
604,00:33:38,00:33:39,"An organ with a memory, maybe?"
605,00:33:39,00:33:41,The most. Liver.
606,00:33:41,00:33:45,He died two months after receiving it back in ’93.
607,00:33:45,00:33:48,Lived one state over in Arizona.
608,00:33:48,00:33:50,I have the cemetery address.
609,00:33:50,00:33:52,"Hey, Sara, got the warrant."
610,00:33:52,00:33:53,Awesome.
611,00:33:53,00:33:55,We’ll keep you posted.
612,00:34:17,00:34:21,Embalming certainly retards the decomposition process.
613,00:34:21,00:34:23,"Yeah, well, it doesn’t stop the smell."
614,00:34:23,00:34:27,The liver’s degraded but any metal should still be there.
615,00:34:29,00:34:31,We’ll find out.
616,00:35:15,00:35:17,"Nick, did you get anything?"
617,00:35:17,00:35:18,"Hey, Sara. Yeah."
618,00:35:18,00:35:21,Sodium selenite--selenium.
619,00:35:21,00:35:25,280 milligrams for a 180-pound man...
620,00:35:25,00:35:26,That’s murder.
621,00:35:26,00:35:29,"Yeah, well, it would have been murder for a 300-pound man."
622,00:35:29,00:35:31,This is different than the shampoo compound.
623,00:35:31,00:35:35,"Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E."
624,00:35:35,00:35:38,That combination’s found in selenium supplements injected in animals.
625,00:35:38,00:35:41,"Animals? Like cats, dogs?"
626,00:35:41,00:35:44,"Mostly livestock, grazers."
627,00:35:44,00:35:47,To make up for the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil.
628,00:35:47,00:35:50,How did Claudia get access to this stuff?
629,00:35:50,00:35:53,A dairy farm.
630,00:35:53,00:35:59,"""Gideon Dairy and Cheese."" Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact."
631,00:36:01,00:36:05,Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce type about Claudia’s husband.
632,00:36:05,00:36:08,You want to know who his secretary was?
633,00:36:08,00:36:10,Yeah.
634,00:36:10,00:36:11,Yeah.
635,00:36:11,00:36:13,( Sara chuckles )
636,00:36:13,00:36:14,Our Julia Fairmont.
637,00:36:20,00:36:27,"Ten years ago, you played secretary and you played wife to John Gideon."
638,00:36:27,00:36:32,We have never represented we didn’t know each other previously.
639,00:36:32,00:36:34,JULIA: And I wasn’t playing.
640,00:36:34,00:36:37,I was a hard-working secretary.
641,00:36:37,00:36:41,And you loved your husband right up to the day he died...
642,00:36:41,00:36:44,of 240 milligrams of selenium.
643,00:36:44,00:36:47,"Animal selenium, the kind used for cattle."
644,00:36:47,00:36:49,"Well, we did live in grazing country."
645,00:36:49,00:36:53,"Although, I have to say, Julia knew more about livestock than I did."
646,00:36:53,00:36:54,She rode horses.
647,00:36:54,00:36:59,I took the job because Mr. G let me board my horse at the family stables.
648,00:36:59,00:37:01,"CLAUDIA: Oh, I hated the stables."
649,00:37:01,00:37:03,The smell. Never stepped foot in them.
650,00:37:03,00:37:07,"Implicating you, the secretary."
651,00:37:08,00:37:10,I don’t believe this.
652,00:37:10,00:37:12,WILLOWS: Bravo. ladies.
653,00:37:12,00:37:15,You have got this down to a science.
654,00:37:16,00:37:20,Why did it happen the first time?
655,00:37:20,00:37:29,Hubby ignored you or abused you or you got sick of him fooling around so you started slipping the cow stuff into his chocolate milk?
656,00:37:36,00:37:38,So the two of you struck a deal.
657,00:37:38,00:37:39,"I’m, uh..."
658,00:37:39,00:37:41,I’m coming into a lot of money.
659,00:37:51,00:37:53,"No, we are."
660,00:37:56,00:37:58,SIDLE: And then what?
661,00:37:58,00:38:02,The two of you realized how quickly you could run through a couple million?
662,00:38:02,00:38:05,So you went looking for another mark here in Nevada?
663,00:38:05,00:38:10,But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont.
664,00:38:12,00:38:22,"You shot him because he was cheating but that didn’t get in the way of your long-term goals, did it?"
665,00:38:22,00:38:23,( tapping on glass )
666,00:38:34,00:38:35,I just came from the D.A.
667,00:38:35,00:38:38,Their attorneys were there as well.
668,00:38:38,00:38:42,Based on everything we have the D.A. is not going to move forward.
669,00:38:42,00:38:43,He says it’s a reject.
670,00:38:43,00:38:45,Brass doesn’t have anything?
671,00:38:45,00:38:47,Brass is still in the field.
672,00:38:47,00:38:50,You’re free to go.
673,00:38:57,00:38:59,Where’s the ladies’ room?
674,00:38:59,00:39:03,It’s down the hall to your right.
675,00:39:03,00:39:04,Thanks.
676,00:39:06,00:39:08,Pardon me.
677,00:39:08,00:39:11,"WILLOWS: Well, no big surprise."
678,00:39:11,00:39:15,We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.
679,00:39:15,00:39:18,I like either one of them for the murder-- so will a jury.
680,00:39:18,00:39:21,She-said/she-said defense? It’s never going to fly.
681,00:39:21,00:39:24,They’ll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.
682,00:39:24,00:39:26,That’s what the D.A. said verbatim.
683,00:39:26,00:39:28,See you back at CSI.
684,00:39:28,00:39:29,Wait. What?
685,00:39:29,00:39:33,"So, what, and just let them move on to another state, another husband?"
686,00:39:33,00:39:35,It’s not always up to us.
687,00:39:45,00:39:49,( distant siren wailing )
688,00:39:49,00:39:52,Sara...
689,00:39:52,00:39:53,look...
690,00:39:53,00:39:59,I know this isn’t news to you but sometimes science isn’t enough.
691,00:39:59,00:40:02,What are we doing?
692,00:40:02,00:40:09,"Digging up graves, chasing prints-- if it’s no good in court..."
693,00:40:09,00:40:11,if the killers win...
694,00:40:11,00:40:13,It isn’t a competition.
695,00:40:13,00:40:14,We don’t win.
696,00:40:14,00:40:17,The courts are like dice.
697,00:40:17,00:40:18,They have no memory.
698,00:40:18,00:40:20,What works one week doesn’t work the next.
699,00:40:20,00:40:22,I know that. I do.
700,00:40:22,00:40:25,I know that.
701,00:40:25,00:40:26,That’s why I’m mad.
702,00:40:26,00:40:30,"But, see, if you get mad, then they do win."
703,00:40:30,00:40:31,You just said...
704,00:40:35,00:40:38,"This is one of your riddles, isn’t it?"
705,00:40:38,00:40:41,One of life’s riddles...
706,00:40:43,00:40:44,"but, hey..."
707,00:40:44,00:40:49,the good news-- there’s no statute of limitation on murder.
