0	00:00:04	00:00:08	Oh my god that one guy kept coming up behind me and smelling my hair.
1	00:00:08	00:00:10	What was with all the short guys?
2	00:00:10	00:00:13	He was like, five feet tall.
3	00:00:13	00:00:17	I know, he came up to... there.
4	00:00:17	00:00:19	Aw! There's not a decent guy in there.
5	00:00:19	00:00:23	The one who kept grabbing my ass-- total reject from the Jersey Shore.
6	00:00:23	00:00:26	At least he wasn't dragging around an oxygen tank.
7	00:00:26	00:00:28	Oh, ew.
8	00:00:28	00:00:29	Oh...
9	00:00:29	00:00:33	See the way he's looking at her?
10	00:00:33	00:00:35	It's like she's the only girl in the world.
11	00:00:35	00:00:36	I want that.
12	00:00:38	00:00:40	Where are all the good men?
13	00:00:55	00:00:57	Step back, please. Step back.
14	00:01:06	00:01:08	Smell that?
15	00:01:08	00:01:10	Alcohol.
16	00:01:10	00:01:12	Maybe this guy had a few too many and fell off his balcony.
17	00:01:12	00:01:16	Well, the back of his skull is completely obliterated.
18	00:01:16	00:01:20	Unfortunately, that won't help us determine how far he fell.
19	00:01:23	00:01:27	These injuries could have occurred if he fell five stories or 20.
20	00:01:28	00:01:30	It all happened so fast.
21	00:01:30	00:01:34	It's like the guy just fell out of the sky.
22	00:01:35	00:01:36	What are you looking at?
23	00:01:36	00:01:39	Oh, I'm sorry. You got something in your, uh...
24	00:01:39	00:01:40	I do?
25	00:01:40	00:01:41	Yeah, it's okay.
26	00:01:41	00:01:43	Don't move.
27	00:01:46	00:01:48	What is it?
28	00:01:48	00:01:50	Just a little piece of brains.
29	00:01:50	00:01:53	You always said you were looking for a guy with brains.
30	00:01:53	00:01:57	I'm sorry. I make jokes when I'm nervous.
31	00:01:57	00:01:58	That's all right. Just a couple more questions.
32	00:01:58	00:02:00	Did you girls hear anything before he hit the ground?
33	00:02:00	00:02:04	Any yelling? Screaming?
34	00:02:04	00:02:07	I was just looking for a nice guy.
35	00:02:07	00:02:09	One with a pulse.
36	00:02:09	00:02:11	Maybe a badge?
37	00:02:12	00:02:15	Sorry... I flirt when I'm nervous, too.
38	00:02:18	00:02:20	Thank you.
39	00:02:24	00:02:28	Victim is Brad Malone; guest at the hotel.
40	00:02:28	00:02:29	Bad couple of days.
41	00:02:29	00:02:31	He was down over 100 grand.
42	00:02:31	00:02:33	Another $50,000 in unpaid markers.
43	00:02:33	00:02:35	You got all of that for a hug?
44	00:02:35	00:02:37	Jerry? He used to work for my father.
45	00:02:37	00:02:41	So he just handed over the casino's financials?
46	00:02:41	00:02:43	Come on. How well do you know this guy?
47	00:02:43	00:02:45	It's really not what you're thinking.
48	00:02:45	00:02:48	When Sam died, he... left me a little piece of the Eclipse.
49	00:02:48	00:02:51	How little?
50	00:02:52	00:02:53	It's really no big deal.
51	00:02:53	00:02:55	Then why haven't you said anything?
52	00:02:55	00:02:56	I don't want everyone to know.
53	00:02:56	00:02:57	So now I'm everyone?
54	00:02:58	00:03:00	Let's just... talk about this some other time.
55	00:03:03	00:03:07	Victim is Brad Malone. He was in suite 730.
56	00:03:07	00:03:09	Lost his shirt at the casino.
57	00:03:09	00:03:10	And apparently his pants.
58	00:03:10	00:03:12	It could be a jumper.
59	00:03:12	00:03:14	Vegas is the suicide capital of America.
60	00:03:14	00:03:17	Come to gamble, see a show, kiss your life goodbye.
61	00:04:01	00:04:06	Jumper's name's Brad Malone. Checked in four days ago.
62	00:04:06	00:04:09	Divorced twice. No kids.
63	00:04:09	00:04:11	And he was about to file for bankruptcy.
64	00:04:11	00:04:12	Not a lot to live for.
65	00:04:12	00:04:13	Hmm-mm.
66	00:04:20	00:04:21	Clothes neatly folded.
67	00:04:24	00:04:27	Phone and wallet on the nightstand.
68	00:04:27	00:04:30	Everything in its place.
69	00:04:30	00:04:31	Consistent with suicide.
70	00:04:31	00:04:33	You get your life in order before you end it.
71	00:04:33	00:04:35	There's no suicide note.
72	00:04:35	00:04:38	Nah. They don't typically leave one.
73	00:04:42	00:04:45	Got a few recent e-mails.
74	00:04:45	00:04:46	Past due notices.
75	00:04:51	00:04:52	Offerings of joy?
76	00:04:52	00:04:57	No. No signs of sexual activity.
77	00:04:57	00:04:59	Looks like he spent his last night alone.
78	00:05:03	00:05:04	Door's locked.
79	00:05:08	00:05:10	Latching mechanism only operates from the inside.
80	00:05:10	00:05:13	If he jumped off his balcony, how'd he lock the door behind him?
81	00:05:13	00:05:17	Well, maybe he didn't jump, maybe he was pushed.
82	00:05:17	00:05:21	Which means... he wasn't alone.
83	00:05:21	00:05:23	I'll check it for prints. Yeah.
84	00:05:31	00:05:34	We got a print.
85	00:05:39	00:05:42	Okay, we have a double homicide.
86	00:05:42	00:05:46	Landlord I.D.'d the bodies as Lance and Denise Irwin.
87	00:05:46	00:05:51	Their home was foreclosed on four months ago, so they had to move here.
88	00:05:51	00:05:53	Talk about a step down. Yeah.
89	00:05:53	00:05:55	Who called it in? She did.
90	00:05:55	00:06:00	The 911 operator said all she could get out was, Help me, help me, and then there was no response.
91	00:06:03	00:06:05	Huh. No blood on the phone.
92	00:06:05	00:06:06	Lots of cast-off, though.
93	00:06:06	00:06:09	On the couch, the lamp, the ceiling...
94	00:06:13	00:06:14	Did you see what happened?
95	00:06:16	00:06:18	If you tell us, I'll give you a cracker.
96	00:06:20	00:06:23	Well, if he did see anything, he's not talking.
97	00:06:23	00:06:27	So we contacted Animal Control for the parrot.
98	00:06:27	00:06:28	You know, it's a first floor unit.
99	00:06:28	00:06:32	The window was open, the screen was ripped, so that's probably how the killer got in.
100	00:06:32	00:06:33	Where's the husband?
101	00:06:33	00:06:36	The husband is in the bathroom.
102	00:06:36	00:06:37	What's going on? They dead?
103	00:06:37	00:06:39	Can somebody get this guy out of here? Take his information?
104	00:06:39	00:06:40	We'll be with you in a minute, sir.
105	00:06:40	00:06:41	Let's go.
106	00:06:41	00:06:43	Don't push! I'm goin', okay?
107	00:06:46	00:06:48	Whew.
108	00:06:49	00:06:50	Slight discoloration of his extremities.
109	00:06:50	00:06:53	Lividity is just setting in.
110	00:06:54	00:06:57	The Irwins were killed less than an hour ago.
111	00:06:57	00:06:59	Can't tell if he was stabbed, too.
112	00:07:01	00:07:03	Nasty head wound, though.
113	00:07:03	00:07:05	Possible broken nose, too.
114	00:07:07	00:07:09	So, Mr. Irwin was probably getting ready to go to work.
115	00:07:09	00:07:11	00 a.m. shift at the gas station at the corner.
116	00:07:11	00:07:14	Looks like Mrs. Irwin was making him breakfast.
117	00:07:14	00:07:16	An omelette. Maybe a frittata.
118	00:07:16	00:07:18	Oh, how Continental. Lucky guy.
119	00:07:18	00:07:21	Check out the family photo.
120	00:07:21	00:07:23	Matching outfits.
121	00:07:23	00:07:25	There is something very wrong with that.
122	00:07:25	00:07:27	What? That is a nice family photo.
123	00:07:27	00:07:29	Still wrong.
124	00:07:29	00:07:30	I don't see the cat.
125	00:07:30	00:07:33	Probably took off.
126	00:07:33	00:07:38	Okay, so the killer came through the window and surprised Mrs. Irwin, right?
127	00:07:47	00:07:51	Killer hears the husband getting out of the shower.
128	00:07:51	00:07:52	Goes to take care of him.
129	00:08:00	00:08:01	Hey, uh, guys?
130	00:08:01	00:08:04	Cash and credit cards are still here.
131	00:08:04	00:08:08	You know, come to think of it, parrots like these are worth thousands of dollars.
132	00:08:08	00:08:10	More, if they can talk.
133	00:08:10	00:08:12	I don't think this is a robbery.
134	00:08:12	00:08:13	Well, maybe they were targeted.
135	00:08:13	00:08:15	I'll go talk to the landlord.
136	00:08:15	00:08:18	See if anybody had a problem with the Irwins.
137	00:08:18	00:08:20	Hey, David. Hey.
138	00:08:20	00:08:23	I am so sorry I'm late. It's been one of those days.
139	00:08:23	00:08:25	They're not going anywhere.
140	00:08:29	00:08:32	What is the deal with glass tables today?
141	00:09:07	00:09:08	The print on the balcony door belongs to Malone.
142	00:09:10	00:09:12	There's only one set of shoe prints out here.
143	00:09:12	00:09:15	Size 10, same size as Mr. Malone.
144	00:09:15	00:09:20	If he was pushed from this balcony, there'd be evidence of his attacker out here and there doesn't appear to be any.
145	00:09:20	00:09:23	Maybe he was pushed from somewhere else?
146	00:09:33	00:09:35	Look where the body landed.
147	00:09:35	00:09:37	The body's not directly below this balcony.
148	00:09:37	00:09:39	It's under the one next door.
149	00:09:42	00:09:46	Suite next door is registered to a Stacy Cano and a Dana Carlston, from Ohio.
150	00:09:46	00:09:48	No connection to the victim that we know of.
151	00:09:54	00:09:56	Drop of blood.
152	00:10:00	00:10:01	LVPD! Open up!
153	00:10:14	00:10:16	Got a blood trail.
154	00:10:22	00:10:23	Hey...
155	00:11:05	00:11:09	Here you go. Drink this.
156	00:11:09	00:11:10	Thank you.
157	00:11:10	00:11:13	You've got some minor bruising, but no open wounds.
158	00:11:13	00:11:19	And it appears that the blood that you were both covered in doesn't belong to either of you.
159	00:11:19	00:11:21	Who does it belong to then?
160	00:11:21	00:11:24	We were hoping you could tell us.
161	00:11:24	00:11:26	Do you recognize this man?
162	00:11:29	00:11:32	No, I don't think so.
163	00:11:32	00:11:35	We think he might have been in your hotel room last night.
164	00:11:37	00:11:38	You don't remember?
165	00:11:38	00:11:41	We had a lot to drink.
166	00:11:41	00:11:44	Everything's a little hazy.
167	00:11:44	00:11:46	Do you think that this is his blood?
168	00:11:49	00:11:50	What happened to him?
169	00:11:50	00:11:52	He's dead.
170	00:11:52	00:11:54	Oh, my God.
171	00:11:54	00:11:57	I'm gonna be sick again.
172	00:11:59	00:12:03	An officer's going to come by and take you both to the hospital, get you checked out.
173	00:12:03	00:12:06	But we're still going to need to ask you some more questions.
174	00:12:06	00:12:07	Okay?
175	00:12:07	00:12:10	Okay.
176	00:12:13	00:12:17	The victim suffered a fractured skull and intercranial bleed.
177	00:12:17	00:12:19	Rendered him unconscious.
178	00:12:19	00:12:22	So the killer attacked him in the shower and smashed his head against the wall.
179	00:12:22	00:12:23	And he drowned.
180	00:12:23	00:12:24	Drowned?!
181	00:12:24	00:12:27	We didn't find any water in the tub.
182	00:12:27	00:12:31	You know, it's possible to drown in an inch of water.
183	00:12:31	00:12:33	Victim was unconscious. Couldn't lift his head up.
184	00:12:33	00:12:36	Drain was clogged. Water built up.
185	00:12:36	00:12:38	By the time you arrived, the water was gone.
186	00:12:39	00:12:41	But I found something else.
187	00:12:41	00:12:44	Healed scars on his upper body.
188	00:12:44	00:12:46	Could be from some past altercation.
189	00:12:46	00:12:49	Guess Mr. Irwin had some enemies.
190	00:12:49	00:12:51	You are dead, you hear me?!
191	00:12:51	00:12:55	You're dead! You left that message on the Irwin's voice mail a couple days ago, Dwayne.
192	00:12:55	00:12:56	How do you know it was me?
193	00:12:56	00:12:58	How do I know it was you?
194	00:12:58	00:13:00	You called from your home phone.
195	00:13:00	00:13:02	Yeah, that doesn't prove I made the call.
196	00:13:02	00:13:03	Dude, it's your voice.
197	00:13:03	00:13:07	All right, look, Dwayne, you live next door to the Irwins.
198	00:13:07	00:13:09	Your landlord says you threatened him several times.
199	00:13:09	00:13:11	You tried to get him evicted, right?
200	00:13:11	00:13:14	Yeah, I hated him all right, but I didn't kill him.
201	00:13:14	00:13:17	I thought about killing that bird, though.
202	00:13:17	00:13:19	It never shut up. squawking all day and night.
203	00:13:19	00:13:20	Hold on a minute.
204	00:13:20	00:13:23	You mean you threatened to kill your neighbors because the bird was making too much noise?
205	00:13:23	00:13:24	Wasn't just the bird.
206	00:13:24	00:13:26	The Irwins were arguing all the time.
207	00:13:26	00:13:28	Screaming, throwing things.
208	00:13:28	00:13:30	It was like Fight Club over there.
209	00:13:30	00:13:31	You call the cops?
210	00:13:31	00:13:33	No, they wanted to kill each other. Why not let 'em.
211	00:13:33	00:13:36	00 this morning?
212	00:13:36	00:13:37	In my apartment.
213	00:13:37	00:13:39	Your apartment? Alone?
214	00:13:39	00:13:41	Not exactly.
215	00:13:41	00:13:43	Not exactly? What does that mean?
216	00:13:43	00:13:47	I was having some pretty hot phone sex with Betsy.
217	00:13:47	00:13:49	Okay, I'm going to have to verify that.
218	00:13:49	00:13:51	How do I get ahold of Betsy?
219	00:13:51	00:13:52	You got a credit card?
220	00:13:52	00:13:56	Only cost you $4.99 a minute.
221	00:15:09	00:15:12	You ladies had quite a party last night.
222	00:15:12	00:15:14	We were celebrating.
223	00:15:14	00:15:19	My divorce was finalized a week ago.
224	00:15:19	00:15:20	How long were you married?
225	00:15:20	00:15:21	Seven years.
226	00:15:21	00:15:25	Worked two jobs to send that son of a bitch to medical school.
227	00:15:25	00:15:30	And it turned out he was examining the anatomy of every girl in the class.
228	00:15:30	00:15:32	Hmm. I was married to one of those.
229	00:15:32	00:15:34	Then you know.
230	00:15:34	00:15:37	It's been the worst year of my life.
231	00:15:37	00:15:43	Oh, I just wanted to cut loose and have some fun.
232	00:15:43	00:15:48	Stacy, we found Brad Malone's fingerprints on your balcony.
233	00:15:48	00:15:50	He was staying in the room next to yours.
234	00:15:50	00:15:51	Good-looking guy.
235	00:15:51	00:15:56	I mean, is it possible that you and Dana met him in the hall, invited him in for drinks?
236	00:15:56	00:16:00	I honestly-- I wish I could remember.
237	00:16:00	00:16:02	We were pretty hammered.
238	00:16:02	00:16:05	Were your drinks ever out of your sight?
239	00:16:06	00:16:09	Maybe.
240	00:16:09	00:16:11	Um, when I was dancing.
241	00:16:11	00:16:16	Wh-What's the last thing you remember about last night?
242	00:16:16	00:16:19	Um, we were at a club...
243	00:16:26	00:16:27	Which one?
244	00:16:27	00:16:28	I have no idea.
245	00:16:30	00:16:41	We made our way from one end of the Strip to the other, and then it's just like I'm looking down a long tube.
246	00:16:50	00:16:55	I haven't had that much to drink since college.
247	00:16:55	00:16:59	My weekends are usually full of soccer and birthday parties.
248	00:16:59	00:17:01	Not a lot of adult time.
249	00:17:05	00:17:11	Do you recall meeting Brad Malone in one of the clubs you went to?
250	00:17:11	00:17:13	I told you I don't remember.
251	00:17:13	00:17:16	I'm just trying to understand how he ended up in your suite.
252	00:17:16	00:17:19	I'd like to know that, too.
253	00:17:23	00:17:32	Um, well, Dana, your physical exams indicate that both you and Stacy engaged in sexual activity last night.
254	00:17:32	00:17:35	Oh, my God.
255	00:17:35	00:17:37	You're going to be okay.
256	00:17:37	00:17:39	I'm going to try to help you figure this out.
257	00:17:39	00:17:44	My husband and I, we fell in love when we were 16.
258	00:17:44	00:17:47	He's the only man I've ever been with.
259	00:17:48	00:17:52	Alcohol affects the frontal lobe of the brain, which controls judgment.
260	00:17:52	00:17:54	Makes people do things they wouldn't ordinarily do.
261	00:17:54	00:17:56	Don't I know it.
262	00:17:56	00:18:02	One night in college, I drank so much, that I woke up the next morning on my front lawn with a box of corn flakes stuck to my head.
263	00:18:02	00:18:04	Had no idea how it got there.
264	00:18:04	00:18:05	Why am I not surprised.
265	00:18:05	00:18:07	Eh. College.
266	00:18:07	00:18:11	The frontal lobe of the brain also controls memory, which is why Dana and Stacy can't remember anything.
267	00:18:11	00:18:17	It's kind of hard to remember a complete stranger from a three-way in the middle of the night.
268	00:18:21	00:18:23	Hm. That's an odd place for an iron.
269	00:18:27	00:18:29	Somebody got steamed.
270	00:18:41	00:18:42	Positive for blood.
271	00:18:42	00:18:45	We smelled alcohol on our victim.
272	00:18:45	00:18:47	Which means he had been drinking.
273	00:18:47	00:18:48	We know the girls had been drinking.
274	00:18:48	00:18:51	We know they were in this room having sex.
275	00:18:51	00:18:54	So somewhere during the evening, the party took a darker turn.
276	00:18:54	00:18:58	That's the problem with a menage a trois, is somebody always gets left out.
277	00:18:58	00:19:00	Yes, someone always gets jealous.
278	00:19:00	00:19:05	The question is, did one of those girls get so angry that she picked up that iron and used it as a weapon?
279	00:19:05	00:19:07	Stacy had just come off a bitter divorce.
280	00:19:07	00:19:10	Maybe our victim said something, did something, that reminded her of her ex.
281	00:19:10	00:19:11	She snapped.
282	00:19:15	00:19:21	She picked up the iron, struck him in the head, killed him and then Dana helped her get rid of the evidence.
283	00:19:21	00:19:22	And what's that old saying?
284	00:19:22	00:19:24	A good friend will help you move.
285	00:19:24	00:19:27	A really good friend will help you move a body.
286	00:19:31	00:19:33	Hey. Brass said the neighbor's alibi checked out.
287	00:19:33	00:19:38	The sex line confirmed that Dwayne's hands were full when the Irwins were killed.
288	00:19:38	00:19:41	Well, he was also right about the Irwins' marital discord.
289	00:19:41	00:19:44	Police were called out to their house at least once a month.
290	00:19:44	00:19:46	Here are some of the 911 tapes.
291	00:19:46	00:19:53	911. What is your emergency? WOMAN He's gonna kill me!
292	00:19:53	00:19:55	You call the cops, you stupid bitch?
293	00:19:57	00:19:59	Thin line between love and hate.
294	00:19:59	00:20:02	Did you run the prints from the apartment?
295	00:20:02	00:20:04	Yeah. They all came back to the Irwins.
296	00:20:04	00:20:06	I spoke with the landlord about the window.
297	00:20:06	00:20:08	Turns out the screen's been broken for weeks.
298	00:20:08	00:20:13	Apparently Mr. Irwin put his fist through it.
299	00:20:13	00:20:15	So maybe... there was no intruder.
300	00:20:15	00:20:17	I'm sick of you!
301	00:20:17	00:20:19	Every single day, all you do is watch your stupid football...
302	00:20:19	00:20:22	They get into another fight.
303	00:20:22	00:20:25	This time, Mr. Irwin pulls a knife on her.
304	00:20:28	00:20:29	He kills her.
305	00:20:29	00:20:32	Got her blood all over him, so he takes a shower.
306	00:20:32	00:20:34	Slips in her blood and drowns.
307	00:20:34	00:20:36	Karma's a bitch.
308	00:20:36	00:20:41	If we're right, his prints will be on the knife, and her blood will be in the tub.
309	00:20:41	00:20:47	Considering the damage to Brad Malone's skull, I can't tell you whether he was struck by an iron.
310	00:20:47	00:20:49	These cuts are from the glass table.
311	00:20:49	00:20:54	On the plus side, take a look at the abrasions on his buttocks and thighs.
312	00:20:54	00:20:57	That's linear clotting.
313	00:20:57	00:21:00	It means his blood was flowing when he hit the pavement.
314	00:21:00	00:21:02	These look like drag marks.
315	00:21:02	00:21:04	I pulled glass and some interesting trace from them.
316	00:21:06	00:21:09	These look like paint chips.
317	00:21:09	00:21:11	They're the same color as the railing at The Eclipse.
318	00:21:11	00:21:13	That's consistent with being pushed over backwards.
319	00:21:13	00:21:16	Mr. Malone's last night wasn't all bad.
320	00:21:16	00:21:19	I did a penile swab and found vaginal secretions.
321	00:21:19	00:21:21	He had sex close to time of death.
322	00:21:21	00:21:22	That's odd.
323	00:21:22	00:21:25	We found a used condom in the women's hotel room.
324	00:21:25	00:21:29	Parallel linear scrapes with parabolic edges.
325	00:21:29	00:21:32	Fingernail marks.
326	00:21:32	00:21:36	Well, maybe Mr. Malone got a little too aggressive with the second woman.
327	00:21:36	00:21:37	Didn't want to use a condom.
328	00:21:37	00:21:39	She struck him in the back of the head with the iron.
329	00:21:39	00:21:41	That didn't stop him.
330	00:21:41	00:21:44	So maybe one of them or both of them pushed him off the balcony.
331	00:21:44	00:21:48	In my fantasies, a three-way never ends in death.
332	00:21:50	00:21:52	This sheet...
333	00:21:52	00:21:56	Brad Malone's pants and the iron.
334	00:21:56	00:21:59	All this blood came from the same person.
335	00:21:59	00:22:00	Brad Malone.
336	00:22:00	00:22:02	Nope. Unknown male.
337	00:22:03	00:22:06	You're saying there was a second man in the room?
338	00:22:06	00:22:09	I'm saying that three-way was a four-way.
339	00:22:11	00:22:12	Oh.
340	00:22:18	00:22:19	What is he still doing here?
341	00:22:19	00:22:21	What happened to Animal Control?
342	00:22:21	00:22:23	They must have forgotten about him.
343	00:22:23	00:22:25	We should bring him back to the lab, hmm?
344	00:22:26	00:22:28	You hungry, buddy?
345	00:22:29	00:22:32	What's the point of having a parrot if he doesn't talk?
346	00:22:32	00:22:34	Well, he might be traumatized.
347	00:22:34	00:22:36	He was living in an abusive household.
348	00:22:36	00:22:38	He witnessed Dad kill Mom.
349	00:22:38	00:22:39	Now if we could only prove it.
350	00:22:39	00:22:41	None of her blood was in the bathroom.
351	00:22:41	00:22:44	Doc Robbins said the tub might have had a clogged drain.
352	00:22:44	00:22:48	Hopefully, some of her blood got stuck in the trap when Mr. Irwin took a shower.
353	00:22:48	00:22:50	Yeah, I'm on it.
354	00:22:50	00:22:54	You know, this would be a lot easier if you just told us what happened.
355	00:23:23	00:23:26	I found hair and a bunch of feathers in the trap.
356	00:23:26	00:23:30	Feathers? Yeah. Guess they didn't just dress him up, but they gave him showers, too.
357	00:23:30	00:23:32	Looks like blood on the feathers.
358	00:23:32	00:23:35	Hopefully, it belongs to Mrs. Irwin.
359	00:23:35	00:23:37	What are you doing?
360	00:23:37	00:23:38	Well, these blood drops weren't here before.
361	00:23:38	00:23:41	Our crime scene's been contaminated. What?
362	00:23:41	00:23:42	The door was sealed.
363	00:23:44	00:23:47	They're paw prints.
364	00:23:47	00:23:49	Guess the Cat in the Hat came back.
365	00:23:49	00:23:52	Or he's been hiding here this whole time.
366	00:23:58	00:24:00	I found him.
367	00:24:00	00:24:01	Well, you're evidence now, buddy.
368	00:24:01	00:24:03	You're coming back to the lab, too.
369	00:24:03	00:24:05	Come here. Come here, kitty.
370	00:24:05	00:24:06	Come on, buddy.
371	00:24:07	00:24:11	You're telling me those ladies from Ohio had two men in their room?
372	00:24:11	00:24:12	Yeah. Wow.
373	00:24:12	00:24:16	One guy ends up dead, and the other one's blood is all over the bedroom.
374	00:24:16	00:24:17	That must have been some orgy.
375	00:24:17	00:24:19	Actually, it was more of a one-on-one thing.
376	00:24:19	00:24:20	She never swapped partners.
377	00:24:20	00:24:26	We found a condom that contained DNA profiles of the newly divorced Stacy and the mystery man.
378	00:24:26	00:24:33	And Dana's SAE kit indicated that she had unprotected sex with Brad Malone.
379	00:24:33	00:24:35	And the women claim that they don't remember any of this?
380	00:24:35	00:24:37	Come on. Give me a break.
381	00:24:37	00:24:38	Give mea break.
382	00:24:38	00:24:43	Do you know what it's like to wake up naked in a motel room with no memory of how you got there?
383	00:24:43	00:24:45	Your head is throbbing.
384	00:24:45	00:24:46	You're bruised, you're sore.
385	00:24:46	00:24:50	You've got no idea of what you did or what was done to you.
386	00:24:50	00:24:52	But you do?
387	00:24:55	00:24:57	Well, yeah.
388	00:25:06	00:25:09	A couple of years ago, I...
389	00:25:09	00:25:17	went with a friend to a John Mayer concert, and someone roofied my drink.
390	00:25:20	00:25:22	What? You were... you were raped?
391	00:25:22	00:25:24	No, thank God.
392	00:25:24	00:25:27	I wasn't. I... I thought I was.
393	00:25:27	00:25:31	But... I mean, even worse than that, was just having no memory of it.
394	00:25:31	00:25:33	There was just hours of my life gone.
395	00:25:33	00:25:38	How come you... you never told me any of this?
396	00:25:39	00:25:41	Not something I like to talk about.
397	00:25:42	00:25:44	Yeah, I'm getting used to that.
398	00:25:47	00:25:48	Hey.
399	00:25:48	00:25:50	Hey.
400	00:25:50	00:25:51	Sorry to interrupt.
401	00:25:51	00:25:54	We just got back Dana and Stacy's tox report.
402	00:25:54	00:25:56	Stacy's alcohol level was .32.
403	00:25:56	00:25:59	That's the equivalent of 13 drinks.
404	00:25:59	00:26:01	We also found GHB in their systems.
405	00:26:01	00:26:03	So they were drugged.
406	00:26:03	00:26:05	Yeah, it was in their yard-longs.
407	00:26:05	00:26:11	Dana had trace amounts of GHB, but her blood alcohol level was only .07.
408	00:26:11	00:26:13	That's not even legally drunk.
409	00:26:13	00:26:17	Look, I'm telling you, your soccer mom Dana remembers a lot more about last night than she's letting on.
410	00:26:17	00:26:19	Someone drugged us?
411	00:26:21	00:26:22	Is that why we don't remember anything?
412	00:26:22	00:26:27	Well, that's why Stacy doesn't remember, but you were only slightly intoxicated.
413	00:26:27	00:26:28	Not enough to cause memory loss.
414	00:26:28	00:26:31	Dana, you need to tell us the truth.
415	00:26:31	00:26:34	We know that Brad Malone wasn't the only man in your room last night.
416	00:26:34	00:26:36	Who else was there?
417	00:26:38	00:26:40	I think his name was Kyle.
418	00:26:42	00:26:43	We never got his last name.
419	00:26:43	00:26:45	And where did you meet this Kyle?
420	00:26:45	00:26:46	At a bar.
421	00:26:46	00:26:48	I don't remember which one.
422	00:26:48	00:26:49	And how did he end up in your room?
423	00:26:49	00:26:52	Stacy invited him.
424	00:26:52	00:26:55	We emptied the minibar.
425	00:26:55	00:26:59	Then Stacy wanted to dance, so...
426	00:26:59	00:27:01	we blasted the stereo.
427	00:27:01	00:27:03	Is that when Brad joined the party?
428	00:27:03	00:27:06	He knocked on our door. He told us to keep it down.
429	00:27:06	00:27:09	And Stacy invited him in for a drink.
430	00:27:09	00:27:13	And then... she and Kyle went into the bedroom.
431	00:27:15	00:27:16	Leaving you alone with Brad.
432	00:27:19	00:27:24	Well, we found your vaginal fluid and Brad's semen on the sofa, as well as the coffee table.
433	00:27:24	00:27:26	It seems like things got pretty crazy.
434	00:27:26	00:27:28	It... it wasn't like that.
435	00:27:28	00:27:31	He raped me!
436	00:27:34	00:27:35	I slept with one man my whole life.
437	00:27:35	00:27:38	You think I'm going to have unprotected sex with a total stranger?
438	00:27:38	00:27:41	I begged him to stop.
439	00:27:41	00:27:43	And because he raped you, you pushed him off the balcony?
440	00:27:45	00:27:46	I didn't push him.
441	00:27:46	00:27:48	Then who did?
442	00:27:49	00:27:54	After Brad raped me... I went into the bedroom.
443	00:27:56	00:28:00	And Kyle grabbed me, and he... he pulled me down.
444	00:28:00	00:28:03	He said it was his turn.
445	00:28:05	00:28:07	All of a sudden, Brad was there.
446	00:28:07	00:28:09	Kyle flipped out.
447	00:28:09	00:28:11	He... he ran at Brad.
448	00:28:11	00:28:13	Shoved him into the other room.
449	00:28:13	00:28:17	He-he-he just kept shoving him and shoving him and shoving him.
450	00:28:21	00:28:25	So Dana was raped, witnessed a murder, and then she goes to bed as if nothing had happened?
451	00:28:25	00:28:27	Kyle said, if she told anyone, he'd come back and kill her.
452	00:28:27	00:28:29	She was scared.
453	00:28:29	00:28:32	Well, was there any evidence of rape in her physical exam?
454	00:28:32	00:28:34	There was bruising, but it was inconclusive.
455	00:28:34	00:28:37	Well, whatever happened in that hotel room, we know our mystery man Kyle was involved.
456	00:28:37	00:28:39	We need to find him.
457	00:28:39	00:28:42	David, you said you had something you wanted to show me.
458	00:28:42	00:28:44	Yes. This is from the bedding in the women's motel room.
459	00:28:44	00:28:47	Take a look.
460	00:28:48	00:28:49	A feather?
461	00:28:49	00:28:50	Not just any feather.
462	00:28:50	00:28:54	It's premium quality, hand-harvested Hungarian goose down.
463	00:28:54	00:28:57	Now, take a look at this feather that Nick found on the floor.
464	00:28:59	00:29:01	It's synthetic.
465	00:29:01	00:29:04	Made from a very specific blend of polyester fibers. Mmm.
466	00:29:04	00:29:07	I managed to trace it to a manufacturer in China.
467	00:29:07	00:29:13	They supply low-end pillows to several motels in Vegas, but their biggest buyer is a bar called the Pillow Club.
468	00:29:13	00:29:17	Stacy and Dana said they went to a lot of clubs, a lot of bars last night.
469	00:29:17	00:29:26	Now, I happen to know from personal experience that this particular club does sell the yard-long drinks, much like the ones that you found in the their suite.
470	00:29:26	00:29:28	Maybe that's where they met Kyle.
471	00:29:28	00:29:31	But what does a club need with pillows?
472	00:29:47	00:29:50	So, half-naked people hitting each other with pillows.
473	00:29:50	00:29:52	An adult slumber party.
474	00:29:52	00:29:53	That's kinky.
475	00:29:53	00:29:55	Well, you're already dressed for bed.
476	00:29:55	00:29:57	It sends a pretty clear message.
477	00:29:57	00:29:59	Yeah, add alcohol to the mix.
478	00:29:59	00:30:01	Gives you permission to act out your aggressions.
479	00:30:01	00:30:03	No limits, no taboos.
480	00:30:04	00:30:06	Excuse me.
481	00:30:06	00:30:07	What can I get you?
482	00:30:07	00:30:08	Yeah, we're from the crime lab.
483	00:30:08	00:30:12	We have reason to believe that these two women were in here drinking last night.
484	00:30:12	00:30:14	Drinking a lot.
485	00:30:14	00:30:15	You know who might have served them?
486	00:30:15	00:30:18	It was my night off, but check at the bar.
487	00:30:20	00:30:24	Our bartender, Kyle, he was working.
488	00:30:24	00:30:25	Thanks.
489	00:30:31	00:30:33	Hey.
490	00:30:33	00:30:35	Are you Kyle?
491	00:30:35	00:30:37	Yeah.
492	00:30:37	00:30:39	What happened to your head?
493	00:30:39	00:30:41	Oh, I hit it on the edge of the bar.
494	00:30:41	00:30:43	Say what?
495	00:30:43	00:30:45	I said I hit it on the edge of the...
496	00:30:45	00:30:47	Aah! Damn!
497	00:30:47	00:30:48	What the hell, man?
498	00:30:50	00:30:51	Looks like you ran into an iron.
499	00:30:59	00:31:00	Man, girl's lying.
500	00:31:00	00:31:02	About which part?
501	00:31:02	00:31:04	The attempted rape or the murder?
502	00:31:04	00:31:07	Both. We know you had sex with Stacy Cano.
503	00:31:07	00:31:09	We also found GHB in her system.
504	00:31:09	00:31:10	You're a bartender.
505	00:31:10	00:31:12	Man, you had easy access.
506	00:31:12	00:31:15	Yeah, I gave her the drugs, but she asked for them.
507	00:31:15	00:31:17	Said she wanted to party, lose control.
508	00:31:24	00:31:25	Come on, Dana!
509	00:31:25	00:31:26	You said that we were going to have fun.
510	00:31:26	00:31:27	Drink it!
511	00:31:27	00:31:30	Whoo!
512	00:31:30	00:31:32	So Stacy thought we'd bring the party back to her room.
513	00:31:32	00:31:35	Then, after you had sex with her, you thought you'd just have sex with Dana?
514	00:31:35	00:31:39	Hey, I offered to do her, but the bitch hit me in the head with an iron.
515	00:31:39	00:31:40	Don't be like that, girl.
516	00:31:40	00:31:42	Damn! Come on!
517	00:31:43	00:31:45	Wait a minute, now.
518	00:31:46	00:31:50	Dana is the one who hit you in the head with the iron.
519	00:31:50	00:31:52	Yeah. She went mental.
520	00:31:52	00:31:54	Chased me out in the hallway, screaming.
521	00:31:54	00:31:55	Where was Brad Malone during all this?
522	00:31:55	00:31:57	You mean the hero boy next door?
523	00:31:57	00:31:59	He came out his room to see what the hell was going on.
524	00:31:59	00:32:00	Get out!
525	00:32:00	00:32:02	Are you okay, miss?
526	00:32:02	00:32:03	None of your damn business!
527	00:32:03	00:32:05	Get the hell out of here!
528	00:32:06	00:32:11	So, you and Mr. Malone were never in the ladies' hotel room at the same time?
529	00:32:11	00:32:14	I got to the elevator to see Captain America taking Dana back to her room.
530	00:32:14	00:32:16	Where'd you go after that?
531	00:32:16	00:32:17	E.R.
532	00:32:17	00:32:19	Took me four hours to get stitched back up.
533	00:32:19	00:32:21	You don't believe me, call Desert Palm.
534	00:32:21	00:32:23	I'll do that.
535	00:32:23	00:32:25	C.O.D. is exsanguination due to sharp force injury.
536	00:32:25	00:32:27	Stabbed once.
537	00:32:27	00:32:28	Only one stab wound?
538	00:32:28	00:32:29	You're kidding me, right?
539	00:32:29	00:32:30	There was castoff on the walls.
540	00:32:30	00:32:32	I mean, her blood was everywhere.
541	00:32:32	00:32:35	None of the physical evidence in this case makes any sense.
542	00:32:35	00:32:36	Only the Irwins' prints in their apartment.
543	00:32:36	00:32:38	Only Mrs. Irwin's prints were on the knife.
544	00:32:38	00:32:41	Only Mr. Irwin's blood was in the bathroom.
545	00:32:41	00:32:42	May-may-may I interject?
546	00:32:42	00:32:43	Please.
547	00:32:43	00:32:49	I don't think Mr. Irwin killed his wife, though she was the victim of foul play.
548	00:32:49	00:32:50	See these scalp lacerations?
549	00:32:50	00:32:52	Yeah.
550	00:32:52	00:32:54	These are talon marks.
551	00:32:54	00:32:56	I heard the Irwins had a parrot.
552	00:32:56	00:33:01	If you are suggesting that the bird is a suspect, he was in his cage with the door closed when we arrived.
553	00:33:01	00:33:03	Parrots are extremely smart.
554	00:33:03	00:33:07	You can teach them to do almost anything, even let themselves in and out of their cages.
555	00:33:07	00:33:09	Well, yeah, it's true, but...
556	00:33:09	00:33:13	there's no way that that bird picked up a knife and stabbed Mrs. Irwin.
557	00:33:15	00:33:17	Right?
558	00:33:29	00:33:31	Wh-What is with this family?
559	00:33:31	00:33:33	Even the animals hate each other.
560	00:33:33	00:33:36	Why didn't you just separate them, Hodges?
561	00:33:38	00:33:46	Even though I project an aura of raw courage and unwavering self-confidence, I suffer from... ornithophobia.
562	00:33:47	00:33:49	You're afraid of birds.
563	00:33:49	00:33:54	Let's just say that I was terrorized by a flock of Canadian geese while visiting my uncle in Saskatchewan.
564	00:33:54	00:33:55	Really?
565	00:33:55	00:33:57	They were Canadian.
566	00:33:57	00:33:58	I thought they were friendly.
567	00:33:58	00:34:03	All right, well, according to Doc Robbins, the parrot attacked Mrs. Irwin.
568	00:34:03	00:34:08	We already know that the cat ran through the crime scene, so we're gonna have to process both of them.
569	00:34:08	00:34:10	I'll take the cat.
570	00:34:40	00:34:41	What is that?
571	00:34:50	00:34:52	What happened to you?
572	00:34:52	00:34:53	The castoff on the walls wasn't from the knife.
573	00:34:53	00:34:54	It was was from the parrot.
574	00:34:54	00:34:56	He attacked Mrs. Irwin.
575	00:34:56	00:35:00	We found her DNA under his talons, and we found her blood under his feathers.
576	00:35:00	00:35:03	When he flapped his wings, it spattered blood on things.
577	00:35:03	00:35:07	The parrot killed Mrs. Irwin?
578	00:35:07	00:35:09	Uh, well, he had an accomplice, the cat.
579	00:35:09	00:35:11	Technically, he's responsible for Mr. Irwin's death.
580	00:35:13	00:35:16	So Sylvester and Tweety whacked their owners.
581	00:35:16	00:35:19	Think of it as a series of unfortunate events.
582	00:35:19	00:35:20	What do you mean, don't think of it as a cartoon?
583	00:35:20	00:35:25	Well, Hodges found traces of soap on the bird, and I found feathers in the bathtub.
584	00:35:25	00:35:28	Mr. Irwin was giving the parrot a shower when the cat attacked.
585	00:35:28	00:35:30	Okay.
586	00:35:30	00:35:34	Hodges also found plastic from the shower curtain under the cat's claws.
587	00:35:34	00:35:37	In his defense, you know, I think the cat was probably going after the bird.
588	00:35:37	00:35:38	The really hate each other.
589	00:35:42	00:35:46	The bathroom door was open, and the cat saw its opportunity.
590	00:36:00	00:36:03	Now, Mrs. Irwin was in the kitchen making breakfast.
591	00:36:03	00:36:05	She must have heard the commotion.
592	00:36:05	00:36:07	So, she went to check it out.
593	00:36:07	00:36:11	There were chopped vegetables on the counter so the knife was already in her hand.
594	00:36:11	00:36:13	And you know what they say about running with scissors.
595	00:36:13	00:36:16	The parrot was trying to get away from the cat.
596	00:36:18	00:36:24	And in his frenzied state, he turned his aggression on Mrs. Irwin.
597	00:36:25	00:36:31	The evidence strongly suggests that Mrs. Irwin, in then trying to get away from the bird, fell onto the coffee table.
598	00:36:39	00:36:41	She stabbed herself? Yeah.
599	00:36:41	00:36:48	And then the cat went into hiding and the bird went back into its cage and shut the door.
600	00:36:48	00:36:52	Remarkably, it all makes perfect sense.
601	00:36:52	00:36:54	There is one thing that we can't explain.
602	00:36:54	00:36:56	Mrs. Irwin had blood all over her hands.
603	00:36:56	00:36:59	How did she call 911 and not get any blood on the phone?
604	00:37:04	00:37:05	Bartender's story checks out.
605	00:37:05	00:37:09	He was in the E.R. when Malone hit the pavement, so he didn't do it.
606	00:37:09	00:37:10	Which means Dana lied.
607	00:37:10	00:37:13	Yeah, makes you wonder what else she's lying about.
608	00:37:13	00:37:15	Like being raped.
609	00:37:15	00:37:19	Well, if she wasn't attacked, why did she push Brad Malone off the balcony?
610	00:37:19	00:37:21	We know that she scratched him.
611	00:37:21	00:37:22	His epithelials were under her nails.
612	00:37:22	00:37:24	Yeah, he's a big guy.
613	00:37:24	00:37:25	Dana's about your size.
614	00:37:25	00:37:28	Is it even possible for her to push him off that balcony?
615	00:37:31	00:37:32	It's possible.
616	00:37:33	00:37:35	Check out my ass.
617	00:37:35	00:37:37	Ray, your ass is a work of art.
618	00:37:37	00:37:40	But there's no paint on the backs of your thighs.
619	00:37:40	00:37:41	Doesn't match Malone's injuries.
620	00:37:41	00:37:45	Well, that would mean his thighs would have to have more contact with the rail when he went over.
621	00:37:45	00:37:50	The only way to replicate those kind of injuries is if he was sitting on the railing when he went over.
622	00:37:52	00:37:53	Fresh coat of paint?
623	00:37:53	00:38:00	Well, rape is all about power, but sitting on a balcony is not a position of power, so...
624	00:38:00	00:38:03	maybe Brad Malone wasn't the aggressor.
625	00:38:03	00:38:06	We know he and Dana had sex right before he died.
626	00:38:06	00:38:09	Did that sex move out to the balcony?
627	00:38:09	00:38:12	Well, we found a lot of partials on the railing.
628	00:38:12	00:38:13	We assume they were fingerprints.
629	00:38:13	00:38:15	Maybe they were toe prints.
630	00:38:15	00:38:19	If they were toe prints, she would have been sitting in his lap.
631	00:38:19	00:38:23	Have a seat, boss.
632	00:38:23	00:38:25	Well, I'm not getting up there.
633	00:38:25	00:38:27	Come on, Catherine.
634	00:38:27	00:38:29	Toes are under the bottom railing there.
635	00:38:29	00:38:31	Got it? Okay. Yo, Ray, you're good.
636	00:38:31	00:38:34	Ecklie's not in the building, right?
637	00:38:34	00:38:36	Seven stories up? Really?
638	00:38:36	00:38:38	Isn't this a little Cirque de Soleil? Oh...
639	00:38:38	00:38:41	Danger just adds to the excitement, Nicky.
640	00:38:41	00:38:42	Suspended Congress.
641	00:38:42	00:38:44	What?
642	00:38:44	00:38:50	This position is called Suspended Congress in the Kama Sutra.
643	00:38:50	00:38:52	What? I'm a doctor.
644	00:38:52	00:38:53	This is my first three-way.
645	00:38:53	00:38:54	Really?
646	00:38:54	00:38:55	Yeah, I'm very excited.
647	00:38:55	00:38:56	Okay.
648	00:38:56	00:38:58	Okay, so things are heating up. Mm-hmm.
649	00:38:58	00:38:59	They're really going at it. Mm-hmm.
650	00:38:59	00:39:02	It wouldn't take much for him to fall over now. No.
651	00:39:12	00:39:14	Yup.
652	00:39:14	00:39:16	Paint right down the back of your thighs.
653	00:39:16	00:39:17	That's match to Brad Malone's injuries.
654	00:39:17	00:39:20	Brad's death was an accident.
655	00:39:20	00:39:23	He fell off the balcony while you were having consensual sex.
656	00:39:23	00:39:28	You did try to save him, which is why he had the scratches on his arm.
657	00:39:30	00:39:34	I have three amazing kids.
658	00:39:34	00:39:37	My husband is the love of my life.
659	00:39:37	00:39:42	Not once in 15 years have I even looked at another man.
660	00:39:42	00:39:43	Until Brad?
661	00:39:43	00:39:47	We had this immediate... connection.
662	00:39:49	00:39:52	I couldn't stop myself.
663	00:39:52	00:39:55	I lost control, and I'm not that person.
664	00:39:56	00:40:02	You have to understand, my husband and I only have sex twice a month.
665	00:40:02	00:40:05	Lights out, under the covers.
666	00:40:05	00:40:07	Well, you're not the first woman to have sex with a stranger...
667	00:40:07	00:40:10	to have cheated on her husband.
668	00:40:10	00:40:13	A man died while I was having sex with him.
669	00:40:15	00:40:19	Incredible...
670	00:40:19	00:40:22	mind-blowing sex.
671	00:40:22	00:40:24	Dana, you're not being charged.
672	00:40:24	00:40:28	You do have some explaining to do to your husband.
673	00:40:30	00:40:34	The part about the mind-blowing sex...
674	00:40:36	00:40:39	I'd leave that part out.
675	00:40:56	00:40:57	Hey.
676	00:40:57	00:40:59	Case closed?
677	00:40:59	00:41:01	Yeah.
678	00:41:07	00:41:09	(sighs) I know you're upset.
679	00:41:09	00:41:14	You think I'm not being honest with you, but...
680	00:41:14	00:41:18	I just don't think couples need to tell each other everything.
681	00:41:18	00:41:21	So, who gets to draw that line?
682	00:41:22	00:41:24	You own a piece of a casino.
683	00:41:24	00:41:25	That's a big thing to keep from me.
684	00:41:25	00:41:28	But, Lou, that's business.
685	00:41:28	00:41:30	That has nothing to do with us.
686	00:41:30	00:41:32	Well, that says a lot.
687	00:41:33	00:41:37	I-I-I've had all the complicated relationships I could handle.
688	00:41:37	00:41:38	This is who I am.
689	00:41:38	00:41:40	Please don't try to change me.
690	00:41:40	00:41:42	I promise I won't try to change you. So, what?
691	00:41:42	00:41:45	Take it or leave it?
692	00:41:48	00:41:50	Call me when you decide.
693	00:42:04	00:42:06	We found you a good home with a nice family.
694	00:42:06	00:42:09	No cats, and they have another bird.
695	00:42:09	00:42:11	This is your last chance.
696	00:42:11	00:42:14	You attack anyone else and your goose is cooked.
697	00:42:17	00:42:19	Ahh! Ow. Damn it.
698	00:42:20	00:42:21	You okay?
699	00:42:21	00:42:22	Yeah.
700	00:42:38	00:42:39	911. What is your emergency?
701	00:42:39	00:42:42	Help me! Help me!
702	00:42:42	00:42:44	No blood on the phone.
703	00:42:44	00:42:47	You've been holding out on us.
