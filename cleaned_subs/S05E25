0,00:00:12,00:00:14,Lab's only got one case tonight.
1,00:00:14,00:00:16,Why'd you bag that? I didn't.
2,00:00:16,00:00:17,That's not Nick's evidence.
3,00:00:17,00:00:19,Maybe it's a message.
4,00:00:19,00:00:21,Nick could be anywhere from Green Valley to Seven Hills to Arizona.
5,00:00:21,00:00:23,Guy comes in here with a package with no return address.
6,00:00:24,00:00:25,It's about Nick.
7,00:00:25,00:00:26,"MAN (on recorder): Hi, CSI guy."
8,00:00:26,00:00:28,You wondering why you're here?
9,00:00:28,00:00:30,Because you followed the evidence.
10,00:00:30,00:00:33,(screaming)
11,00:00:33,00:00:34,WILLOWS: I don't think he knows we can see him.
12,00:00:34,00:00:39,"If they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours, it must mean that he's going to have additional air supply."
13,00:00:39,00:00:42,"GRISSOM: The feed stays active for two minutes every time you press the ""Watch"" button."
14,00:00:42,00:00:43,BROWN: I say we keep the light on.
15,00:00:43,00:00:45,I got called out to a pickup on Viking Circle.
16,00:00:45,00:00:48,I just found an abandoned package with some cash taped to it.
17,00:00:48,00:00:49,"Yeah, the address was a waste of time."
18,00:00:49,00:00:52,The guy probably picked the house at random 'cause he knew we'd chase it.
19,00:00:52,00:00:53,Has Nick's family been informed?
20,00:00:53,00:00:54,That would be my job.
21,00:00:54,00:00:56,GRISSOM: We're not sure who has your son.
22,00:00:56,00:00:58,What the hell do you know?
23,00:00:58,00:00:59,"Aw, Poncho."
24,00:00:59,00:01:01,What the hell you got yourself into?
25,00:01:01,00:01:04,The City of Las Vegas is not going to finance a ransom.
26,00:01:04,00:01:06,I need a million dollars and I need it now.
27,00:01:06,00:01:11,"If you're coming to me like a cop with a tin cup in your hand, the answer is no."
28,00:01:11,00:01:15,"If the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab."
29,00:01:15,00:01:16,"You got a better plan, I'm all ears!"
30,00:01:16,00:01:18,MAN: What does Nick Stokes mean to you?
31,00:01:18,00:01:21,Does your soul die every time you push that button?
32,00:01:21,00:01:23,Welcome to my world.
33,00:01:35,00:01:38,(indistinct police radio transmissions)
34,00:01:42,00:01:43,Pupils are even.
35,00:01:43,00:01:45,He blew himself up and left us with nothing.
36,00:01:45,00:01:48,"Sir, are you experiencing any ringing in your ears?"
37,00:01:49,00:01:50,We got the kidnapper's truck.
38,00:01:50,00:01:52,Nevada tags: 374-Robert-Charlie-David.
39,00:01:52,00:01:54,Run the plate.
40,00:01:54,00:01:55,"That's the wrong box, Greg."
41,00:01:56,00:01:57,"Well, pick one. There's three."
42,00:01:57,00:01:59,That one right there.
43,00:01:59,00:02:00,Give me a break.
44,00:02:00,00:02:01,I haven't done this before.
45,00:02:01,00:02:03,"All right, let's go over it again."
46,00:02:03,00:02:08,"The diagnostic unit gets attached to that black box, which gives us the mileage of his last trip."
47,00:02:08,00:02:09,Like an airplane.
48,00:02:09,00:02:11,That gives us the radius for the search area.
49,00:02:11,00:02:13,Right. Got it.
50,00:02:13,00:02:15,23 miles...
51,00:02:15,00:02:18,and we know he was heading east on the 215.
52,00:02:18,00:02:20,I'll get a map.
53,00:02:26,00:02:28,"Somebody bag this money, please?"
54,00:02:28,00:02:30,"Don't get any funny ideas, either."
55,00:02:32,00:02:33,(sighs)
56,00:02:33,00:02:35,What I had to do to get this money and for what.
57,00:02:36,00:02:39,There's no I.D. on him.
58,00:02:42,00:02:44,(indistinct radio transmission)
59,00:03:03,00:03:06,I got a thumb.
60,00:03:41,00:03:43,How's he doing?
61,00:03:45,00:03:46,Hard to say.
62,00:03:46,00:03:49,"About the same, I guess."
63,00:03:49,00:03:51,I'm gonna get some coffee.
64,00:03:51,00:03:53,Yeah.
65,00:04:05,00:04:08,(air fan goes on)
66,00:04:09,00:04:10,(beep)
67,00:04:10,00:04:12,(sighs)
68,00:04:12,00:04:14,Enough with the...
69,00:04:14,00:04:16,Enough with the damn light!
70,00:04:16,00:04:19,(panting)
71,00:04:21,00:04:23,(sighs)
72,00:04:32,00:04:35,(low whirring)
73,00:04:39,00:04:41,(sighs)
74,00:04:46,00:04:47,(low humming)
75,00:04:47,00:04:48,No.
76,00:04:52,00:04:54,The fan's connected...
77,00:04:54,00:04:57,The fan's connected to the light.
78,00:04:57,00:04:58,(sighs)
79,00:06:11,00:06:13,(sighs)
80,00:06:21,00:06:22,(air fan stops)
81,00:06:22,00:06:24,No.
82,00:06:26,00:06:28,(panting)
83,00:06:39,00:06:41,(groans softly)
84,00:06:52,00:06:54,(panting)
85,00:07:03,00:07:05,(groans)
86,00:07:05,00:07:07,(panting)
87,00:07:32,00:07:34,"What are you doing, Nicky?"
88,00:07:35,00:07:38,(groans)
89,00:07:46,00:07:49,"What are you doing, Nicky?"
90,00:07:54,00:07:56,"Don't do it, Nicky!"
91,00:08:09,00:08:09,"(gunshots, groan)"
92,00:08:12,00:08:14,You son of a bitch!
93,00:08:17,00:08:18,(Nick laughing)
94,00:08:18,00:08:20,(panting)
95,00:08:20,00:08:21,(laughing)
96,00:08:22,00:08:26,"(sighs, panting)"
97,00:08:30,00:08:32,(laughing)
98,00:08:34,00:08:35,Oh.
99,00:08:37,00:08:40,You're still alive.
100,00:09:05,00:09:08,JOHNSON: The light and the fan must have been running off the same battery.
101,00:09:09,00:09:10,"Well, at least Nicky's keeping it together."
102,00:09:10,00:09:12,That's good.
103,00:09:12,00:09:14,What about the Web cam trace?
104,00:09:14,00:09:16,Signal's running through an anonymizer.
105,00:09:16,00:09:18,Different ISP each time we click the button.
106,00:09:18,00:09:21,I think I've got a handle on the pattern. Getting closer.
107,00:09:23,00:09:25,(water splashing)
108,00:09:27,00:09:29,Sara?
109,00:09:29,00:09:31,I got something off your thumb.
110,00:09:36,00:09:42,"So when you struck out on prints, I ran DNA through CODIS, hoping maybe the guy was in the system off an open case or a prior felony."
111,00:09:42,00:09:44,"I got no straight-up match, but..."
112,00:09:44,00:09:47,But you got a moderate stringency match for a Kelly Gordon.
113,00:09:47,00:09:51,"Yeah, seven alleles in common, and based on the age, I'd say it was his daughter."
114,00:09:51,00:09:53,"Good work, Mia."
115,00:09:53,00:10:01,SIDLE: Kelly Gordon is currently in state prison serving year three of a five-year sentence for accessory to murder.
116,00:10:10,00:10:13,The address of her crime scene is 625 Viking Circle.
117,00:10:13,00:10:16,That's the same place where the messenger picked up the package.
118,00:10:16,00:10:18,It wasn't random.
119,00:10:29,00:10:31,"Hey, baby, let's go."
120,00:10:40,00:10:41,Hi. How ya doin'?
121,00:10:44,00:10:47,(two gunshots)
122,00:10:47,00:10:50,Neither was the Styrofoam cup.
123,00:10:50,00:10:55,"So at trial, you testified that you went with your boyfriend to visit a buddy of his."
124,00:10:55,00:11:00,"And when you went in the house, your boyfriend blew the guy away."
125,00:11:00,00:11:01,He wasn't my boyfriend.
126,00:11:01,00:11:04,I knew the guy two weeks.
127,00:11:04,00:11:06,Why am I here?
128,00:11:06,00:11:11,SIDLE: A Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it was found in that house.
129,00:11:11,00:11:14,You claimed you dropped it running for your life.
130,00:11:20,00:11:28,"My word against a cup, and the next five years, I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cell mate."
131,00:11:30,00:11:33,You're not reopening my case.
132,00:11:35,00:11:37,What do you want?
133,00:11:37,00:11:38,Your father took it pretty hard.
134,00:11:38,00:11:41,"He was an aerospace engineer, right?"
135,00:11:41,00:11:44,Good with explosives?
136,00:11:44,00:11:47,"So, this is about my dad?"
137,00:11:47,00:11:48,(sighs)
138,00:11:48,00:11:50,"You know, we got your visitors log."
139,00:11:52,00:11:56,Your father stopped coming to see you six weeks into your sentence.
140,00:11:56,00:11:59,Seeing your daughter turned into some...
141,00:12:01,00:12:04,...hood rat's lesbian sex slave can be rather emotional.
142,00:12:06,00:12:08,Why did he come see you last week?
143,00:12:09,00:12:11,Did you know what he was planning to do?
144,00:12:11,00:12:13,I don't know.
145,00:12:13,00:12:14,What did he do?
146,00:12:14,00:12:16,He kidnapped a friend of mine.
147,00:12:16,00:12:18,A CSI.
148,00:12:18,00:12:20,And then he blew himself up.
149,00:12:20,00:12:22,Tried to take some cops with him.
150,00:12:29,00:12:31,How many did he get?
151,00:12:32,00:12:33,"Hey, we're all still here."
152,00:12:33,00:12:34,Nick is still missing.
153,00:12:34,00:12:35,Who's Nick?
154,00:12:35,00:12:38,The CSI is still missing.
155,00:12:38,00:12:40,Do you know where he is?
156,00:12:42,00:12:45,That's pretty funny-- you guys not being able to find something.
157,00:12:45,00:12:50,"BRASS: Yeah, look, if you cooperate, we can get your sentence reduced."
158,00:12:53,00:12:55,You know what I used to do before this?
159,00:12:56,00:12:59,Back when I was alive?
160,00:12:59,00:13:02,I used to grow things.
161,00:13:02,00:13:04,Outside.
162,00:13:05,00:13:07,I was studying horticulture.
163,00:13:07,00:13:10,Flowers.
164,00:13:11,00:13:15,"My cell mate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's day."
165,00:13:18,00:13:19,Want to smell it?
166,00:13:22,00:13:25,I hope your friend dies.
167,00:14:07,00:14:10,(indistinct police radio transmissions)
168,00:14:51,00:14:54,"Hey, I found a trigger wire."
169,00:14:54,00:14:58,"Maybe... once we reassemble all the components, we'll be able to tell where the bomb came from. Maybe..."
170,00:14:58,00:15:00,"Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe."
171,00:15:00,00:15:04,"Maybe if we count up all the damn ""maybes,"" maybe Nick will be alive!"
172,00:15:04,00:15:07,You know what I'm saying?!
173,00:15:07,00:15:08,Was that necessary?
174,00:15:08,00:15:09,Never mind my clothes.
175,00:15:09,00:15:11,Look at the evidence.
176,00:15:11,00:15:12,Damn it.
177,00:15:14,00:15:17,"Sorry, Greg. I'll go talk to him."
178,00:15:19,00:15:23,"Hey, Warrick, hey."
179,00:15:23,00:15:25,"Hey, how you holding up?"
180,00:15:25,00:15:27,I'm not.
181,00:15:27,00:15:29,I know.
182,00:15:29,00:15:33,"I just can't help but thinking that could have been me in that box, you know?"
183,00:15:33,00:15:35,We flipped a coin for that trash run.
184,00:15:35,00:15:38,"Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin."
185,00:15:38,00:15:41,"If that was me, I would have..."
186,00:15:41,00:15:42,"Hey, you know what?"
187,00:15:42,00:15:43,I know you.
188,00:15:44,00:15:45,I don't believe that.
189,00:15:45,00:15:47,Okay?
190,00:15:47,00:15:49,No. You're wrong.
191,00:15:49,00:15:52,I wouldn't have lasted this far.
192,00:15:52,00:15:56,"Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece..."
193,00:15:56,00:15:59,"SANDERS: Hey, guys, come here."
194,00:15:59,00:16:01,I found something.
195,00:16:04,00:16:05,Look at this.
196,00:16:13,00:16:15,There's something underneath there.
197,00:16:23,00:16:24,"Oh, it's got an edge right here."
198,00:16:24,00:16:26,All right.
199,00:16:26,00:16:27,Another one over here.
200,00:16:27,00:16:29,"WILLOWS: Greg, get some crowbars."
201,00:16:33,00:16:36,SANDERS: Do you think Nick could be under here?
202,00:16:36,00:16:37,"I don't know, man."
203,00:16:37,00:16:40,It would have to be at least six feet long.
204,00:16:40,00:16:43,(grunting)
205,00:16:48,00:16:54,"Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise-- and who's to say he didn't-- he could be."
206,00:17:07,00:17:09,"(scraping, gravel falling)"
207,00:17:25,00:17:26,Hey!
208,00:17:31,00:17:32,I'm in here!
209,00:17:32,00:17:34,(creaking)
210,00:17:34,00:17:35,Hey!
211,00:17:40,00:17:41,(gravel falling)
212,00:17:49,00:17:50,I hit something.
213,00:17:50,00:17:52,(thumping with shovel)
214,00:18:09,00:18:11,I'm here.
215,00:18:11,00:18:13,It's Plexiglas.
216,00:18:13,00:18:15,Nick! Nick?
217,00:18:15,00:18:17,"Hey, I'm right here!"
218,00:18:17,00:18:19,"WARRICK: Nick, hold on there, buddy!"
219,00:18:20,00:18:23,Nick?
220,00:18:30,00:18:31,WILLOWS: It's a dog.
221,00:18:34,00:18:36,It's a dog.
222,00:18:40,00:18:43,(panting)
223,00:18:44,00:18:46,(Plexiglas cracking)
224,00:18:46,00:18:50,(cracking continues)
225,00:18:50,00:18:53,(panting)
226,00:18:53,00:18:55,"(softly): Stop, stop..."
227,00:18:55,00:18:58,(cracking continues)
228,00:18:58,00:18:59,"(quietly): Oh, my God."
229,00:19:00,00:19:03,(owl hooting)
230,00:20:20,00:20:23,"(cracking, dirt slowly pouring)"
231,00:20:36,00:20:40,(clicks recorder button)
232,00:20:41,00:20:44,My name is Nick Stokes.
233,00:20:44,00:20:50,"If anyone... finds this tape, turn it in to the Las Vegas... PD."
234,00:20:51,00:20:53,There should be a reward.
235,00:21:03,00:21:08,"Mom, (voice cracking): Sisko..."
236,00:21:10,00:21:14,"...well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye, but it's all I got."
237,00:21:19,00:21:21,I love you.
238,00:21:21,00:21:25,You raised me right...
239,00:21:25,00:21:29,and I'm going to miss you.
240,00:21:33,00:21:39,"As for the rest of you guys, I know you did the best you could to find me."
241,00:21:47,00:21:50,Grissom...
242,00:21:59,00:22:03,"No, you never did, Nick."
243,00:22:18,00:22:20,He's going into convulsions.
244,00:22:20,00:22:22,He's losing it.
245,00:22:26,00:22:28,What's going on?
246,00:22:28,00:22:30,Wha...?
247,00:22:33,00:22:36,Wait a minute.
248,00:22:43,00:22:45,Ants.
249,00:22:47,00:22:49,"My God, he's being eaten alive."
250,00:22:49,00:22:53,(agonized screaming)
251,00:22:58,00:23:01,(ants chittering)
252,00:23:08,00:23:10,(groaning)
253,00:23:15,00:23:17,(groaning)
254,00:23:31,00:23:33,(cloth tearing)
255,00:23:50,00:23:53,"That's it, Nicky."
256,00:23:53,00:23:55,Stay still.
257,00:23:55,00:23:58,They won't bite.
258,00:23:58,00:24:00,As much.
259,00:24:00,00:24:02,This has got to be a prototype.
260,00:24:02,00:24:08,It was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.
261,00:24:18,00:24:20,"Now, what are those?"
262,00:24:20,00:24:22,I don't know.
263,00:24:27,00:24:40,"All right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did, I figure Nick's got another 90 minutes left in there."
264,00:24:45,00:24:46,(beeps)
265,00:24:46,00:24:48,"GRISSOM: Oh, come on, pal."
266,00:24:48,00:24:49,Yeah.
267,00:24:49,00:24:52,That's it.
268,00:24:52,00:24:54,Come on.
269,00:24:58,00:25:01,Little more.
270,00:25:03,00:25:05,Keep coming.
271,00:25:07,00:25:10,Show me what you're made of.
272,00:25:10,00:25:13,"Come on, buddy."
273,00:25:14,00:25:15,Gotcha.
274,00:25:41,00:25:44,Solenopsis invicta.
275,00:25:44,00:25:46,"They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada."
276,00:25:46,00:25:47,They don't like our soil.
277,00:25:47,00:25:51,The only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.
278,00:25:51,00:25:53,There's 11 nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.
279,00:25:53,00:25:57,"Okay, I've got the Web cam trace down to here."
280,00:25:57,00:26:03,And the data from the black box in Walter Gordon's truck gave us a 23-mile travel radius.
281,00:26:03,00:26:07,"Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area."
282,00:26:07,00:26:10,Here and here.
283,00:26:10,00:26:11,"SIDLE: Wait, wait. wait, wait."
284,00:26:11,00:26:15,"Kelly Gordon, the daughter, worked with plants."
285,00:26:15,00:26:17,Hold on. Hold on.
286,00:26:37,00:26:40,"You guys, Nick is here."
287,00:26:46,00:26:50,(sirens blaring)
288,00:27:37,00:27:40,You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound.
289,00:27:40,00:27:41,Where is it?
290,00:27:41,00:27:44,People usually prefer to stay away from it.
291,00:27:52,00:27:54,"All right, look. Fan out."
292,00:27:54,00:27:55,Look for loose soil.
293,00:27:55,00:27:57,Anything that might've been dug up recently.
294,00:27:57,00:27:59,That's the whole place.
295,00:27:59,00:28:01,(indistinct shouting)
296,00:28:07,00:28:11,(electronic humming)
297,00:28:13,00:28:16,(all talking)
298,00:28:24,00:28:26,"(loud, squeaky static)"
299,00:28:26,00:28:27,Hey!
300,00:28:27,00:28:31,I'm picking up the Web cam transmitter.
301,00:28:31,00:28:34,MAN: She's got something! Move! Move!
302,00:28:37,00:28:39,(beeping)
303,00:28:52,00:28:54,(thump)
304,00:29:01,00:29:05,(rapid beeping)
305,00:29:14,00:29:17,This is it! I found it!
306,00:29:17,00:29:19,It's here.
307,00:29:19,00:29:22,I found it! This is it!
308,00:29:24,00:29:26,Nick!
309,00:29:26,00:29:28,"Nick, we're here. Hang on!"
310,00:29:28,00:29:31,(echoing): Nicky!
311,00:29:31,00:29:33,(groaning)
312,00:29:42,00:29:45,(heart beating)
313,00:29:52,00:29:54,It's a damn shame they didn't get to him sooner.
314,00:29:55,00:29:57,PHILLIPS: I sure will miss him.
315,00:29:57,00:30:03,"You know, David, I've seen fire ant bites in my time, but never anything like this."
316,00:30:03,00:30:08,Do you think he suffered?
317,00:30:08,00:30:11,Do I think he suffered?
318,00:30:11,00:30:13,Yes. Definitely.
319,00:30:13,00:30:17,(laughing)
320,00:30:17,00:30:20,All right. (clears throat) On three.
321,00:30:20,00:30:21,Uno...
322,00:30:21,00:30:22,Dos...
323,00:30:22,00:30:24,Tres! Tres!
324,00:30:27,00:30:31,"All right. Would you care to do the ""Y"" incision?"
325,00:30:31,00:30:35,"Well, ""Y"" not?"
326,00:30:44,00:30:46,ROBBINS: Mind your hands and feet.
327,00:30:46,00:30:49,(saw whirring)
328,00:31:00,00:31:02,Yes...
329,00:31:05,00:31:06,(grunts)
330,00:31:09,00:31:12,He won't be needing this anymore.
331,00:31:12,00:31:14,(song continues)
332,00:31:14,00:31:15,Nice.
333,00:31:15,00:31:17,A lung.
334,00:31:17,00:31:18,"JUDGE STOKES: So, Doc."
335,00:31:18,00:31:20,How did my son die?
336,00:31:20,00:31:22,Anaphylactic shock?
337,00:31:22,00:31:24,"No, no, he didn't live long enough for that."
338,00:31:24,00:31:27,COD was asphyxiation. Oh.
339,00:31:27,00:31:33,"When the blood oxygen drops to less than 16% and the CO2 builds up, there's a rapid loss of consciousness."
340,00:31:33,00:31:35,Death within minutes.
341,00:31:35,00:31:37,With no disfiguring physical findings.
342,00:31:37,00:31:40,"He'll look great at the funeral. Oh, yes."
343,00:31:40,00:31:43,His mother will appreciate that. Good.
344,00:31:47,00:31:48,(heart beating)
345,00:31:48,00:31:51,Your son had a good heart.
346,00:32:20,00:32:23,(beeping)
347,00:32:27,00:32:29,(grunts)
348,00:32:29,00:32:31,(sobbing)
349,00:32:37,00:32:41,(screams weakly)
350,00:32:48,00:32:50,(grunting)
351,00:32:52,00:32:54,I hit something.
352,00:32:55,00:32:56,"WILLOWS: We got you, Nicky."
353,00:32:56,00:32:58,(grunts)
354,00:33:00,00:33:03,(screams weakly)
355,00:33:05,00:33:07,(whimpering)
356,00:33:18,00:33:20,BROWN: Hey!
357,00:33:20,00:33:21,Hey!
358,00:33:21,00:33:23,"We got you, man."
359,00:33:23,00:33:24,"Hey, Nicky!"
360,00:33:24,00:33:26,"Nicky! Yeah. Hey, hold on there."
361,00:33:26,00:33:28,"Hey, put that down."
362,00:33:28,00:33:29,Put that down.
363,00:33:29,00:33:30,Put that down. We got you.
364,00:33:30,00:33:32,We're gonna get you out of here.
365,00:33:32,00:33:33,Hang in there.
366,00:33:35,00:33:36,"Oh, my God."
367,00:33:37,00:33:38,We need that fire extinguisher!
368,00:33:39,00:33:40,Give me that fire extinguisher.
369,00:33:41,00:33:42,"These ants are getting at him, man."
370,00:33:43,00:33:46,(indistinct voices)
371,00:33:53,00:33:54,Oh.
372,00:33:54,00:33:55,"GRISSOM: Short bursts, Greg."
373,00:33:55,00:33:57,Don't suffocate him!
374,00:34:03,00:34:06,"Hang on, buddy."
375,00:34:06,00:34:08,Hang on. Almost out of there.
376,00:34:08,00:34:10,Get the paramedics!
377,00:34:11,00:34:13,BROWN: Hang on. Hang on.
378,00:34:13,00:34:15,We're gonna kill those ants.
379,00:34:15,00:34:16,Okay? (mumbles indistinctly)
380,00:34:18,00:34:20,Yeah. (phone rings)
381,00:34:20,00:34:22,Willows.
382,00:34:22,00:34:24,"Yeah. Hey, boss... We found him."
383,00:34:24,00:34:25,We're getting him out now.
384,00:34:25,00:34:26,That's great. Wai-Wait.
385,00:34:26,00:34:28,Don't-Don't hang up. Just-just listen.
386,00:34:28,00:34:29,What? What?
387,00:34:29,00:34:34,Those dimples on the bottom of the prototype; GCMS found traces of SEMTEX on each one.
388,00:34:34,00:34:35,You got to be kidding me.
389,00:34:35,00:34:37,"BROWN: One, two, three."
390,00:34:37,00:34:39,WILLOWS: Everyone out of the hole.
391,00:34:39,00:34:41,That box is ready to explode!
392,00:34:41,00:34:42,Are you kidding?
393,00:34:42,00:34:43,WILLOWS: Get out of there now!
394,00:34:44,00:34:45,I'm not leaving without Nick.
395,00:34:45,00:34:47,WILLOWS: There are charges under the box!
396,00:34:48,00:34:50,BROWN: I'm not leaving here without him.
397,00:34:50,00:34:52,"GRISSOM: Warrick, Catherine's right."
398,00:34:52,00:34:53,Get out of the hole now.
399,00:34:53,00:34:55,I know what we're gonna do.
400,00:34:55,00:34:56,Just trust me.
401,00:35:00,00:35:01,(screaming)
402,00:35:01,00:35:02,Help!
403,00:35:02,00:35:06,"We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it."
404,00:35:08,00:35:10,(muffled screaming)
405,00:35:12,00:35:13,(muffled screaming)
406,00:35:13,00:35:14,Nick!
407,00:35:14,00:35:16,Can you hear me?
408,00:35:16,00:35:21,"It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay?"
409,00:35:21,00:35:23,Nick!
410,00:35:24,00:35:26,Poncho!
411,00:35:26,00:35:28,Listen to me.
412,00:35:30,00:35:32,Put your hand on my hand.
413,00:35:35,00:35:37,Good.
414,00:35:37,00:35:39,Now listen.
415,00:35:39,00:35:42,There may be explosives under the box.
416,00:35:42,00:35:46,They're probably set on pressure switches.
417,00:35:51,00:35:56,"We need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?"
418,00:35:56,00:36:01,"Poncho, nod your head if you understand me."
419,00:36:05,00:36:09,"Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight."
420,00:36:09,00:36:12,I need a rope and a caribiner.
421,00:36:12,00:36:13,MAN: You got it.
422,00:36:13,00:36:19,"All right, Poncho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down."
423,00:36:19,00:36:21,Okay?
424,00:36:21,00:36:22,Or else you'll blow us all up.
425,00:36:23,00:36:24,Do you understand that?
426,00:36:24,00:36:26,"STOKES: Yeah, yeah."
427,00:36:26,00:36:28,Do you promise?
428,00:36:31,00:36:35,"Poncho, say, ""I promise."" I promise."
429,00:36:35,00:36:37,Bring it over.
430,00:36:37,00:36:39,This way.
431,00:36:39,00:36:40,Don't move.
432,00:36:44,00:36:47,(sobbing)
433,00:36:47,00:36:54,"I got you, I got you, I got you... I got you..."
434,00:36:54,00:36:56,Stay still.
435,00:36:56,00:36:59,Stay still.
436,00:36:59,00:37:02,"(panting): Okay, okay, okay."
437,00:37:02,00:37:05,"All right, bring that over."
438,00:37:16,00:37:22,"Okay, Poncho, I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath."
439,00:37:22,00:37:24,Now!
440,00:37:26,00:37:28,Ready?
441,00:37:28,00:37:28,Go!
442,00:37:30,00:37:32,(explosion)
443,00:38:26,00:38:29,(indistinct voices) over dispatch)
444,00:38:32,00:38:34,(sighs)
445,00:38:36,00:38:38,I want my guys back.
446,00:39:29,00:39:31,You the one?
447,00:39:31,00:39:33,Yeah.
448,00:39:33,00:39:34,(clears throat)
449,00:39:35,00:39:37,"Yeah, back at you."
450,00:39:38,00:39:40,What do you want me to say?
451,00:39:40,00:39:42,I'm sorry?
452,00:39:42,00:39:45,"No, you didn't do anything to me."
453,00:39:46,00:39:49,"And what your dad did, I..."
454,00:39:49,00:39:51,I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.
455,00:39:51,00:39:52,"Hey, Kelly."
456,00:39:53,00:39:55,Kelly.
457,00:39:57,00:39:59,Pick it up.
458,00:40:06,00:40:08,In a few years...
459,00:40:09,00:40:11,when you get out of here...
460,00:40:13,00:40:15,don't take it with you.
461,00:40:21,00:40:23,That's it?
462,00:40:23,00:40:25,Yeah.
463,00:40:25,00:40:27,"Yeah, that's it."
464,00:40:27,00:40:30,We're done.
465,00:40:30,00:40:32,(sighs)
466,00:40:34,00:40:35,(chuckles softly)
