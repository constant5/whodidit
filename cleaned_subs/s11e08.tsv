0	00:00:03	00:00:05	We should go skinny-dipping.
1	00:00:05	00:00:06	Oh, that's fantastic.
2	00:00:06	00:00:06	Come on! Come on!
3	00:00:06	00:00:08	What are you guys talking about?
4	00:00:08	00:00:09	Hey, no. We were just...
5	00:00:09	00:00:11	You know, we were gonna have a little blast.
6	00:00:11	00:00:12	Grab this. Take a swing of this.
7	00:00:12	00:00:13	Grab that right there. What is this?
8	00:00:16	00:00:17	Oh...!
9	00:00:20	00:00:21	Make me one. Make me one.
10	00:00:21	00:00:23	Thank you. Thank you.
11	00:00:23	00:00:24	You're welcome.
12	00:00:24	00:00:26	Lexie.
13	00:00:26	00:00:28	Come on. Lexie, come on.
14	00:00:28	00:00:29	Here. Hey, hey, come on, Lexie.
15	00:00:29	00:00:31	I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! Cannonball. Cannonball.
16	00:00:31	00:00:33	Okay, okay. Is it cold? I don't want to get cold.
17	00:00:33	00:00:35	Lexie, come on! Oh.
18	00:00:35	00:00:38	Got to get in here. It's like a Jacuzzi.
19	00:00:38	00:00:39	Oh, yeah, right.
20	00:00:40	00:00:42	(indistinct, overlapping chatter)Uh-oh.
21	00:00:42	00:00:43	Down, boys. (wolf whistles)
22	00:00:45	00:00:46	Hello. I see you.
23	00:00:49	00:00:51	Oh, it smells like rotten eggs.
24	00:00:51	00:00:53	It's just sulfur. It's good for the zits.
25	00:00:53	00:00:55	Good for you. You've been trying to see me naked for a year.
26	00:00:55	00:00:56	We won't look.
27	00:00:56	00:00:58	Okay, fine.
28	00:00:58	00:00:59	Close your eyes.
29	00:00:59	00:01:01	Hey, huh?
30	00:01:01	00:01:02	Huh?
31	00:01:03	00:01:06	Ooh...
32	00:01:06	00:01:07	(laughs) Oh! Hey!
33	00:01:07	00:01:08	Hey!
34	00:01:09	00:01:12	Hey, what what the hell was that for?
35	00:01:12	00:01:13	You got a look. You don't need to grab my ass.
36	00:01:13	00:01:15	I didn't touch you. Right. Come on.
37	00:01:16	00:01:18	(gasps) What the hell! Hey...
38	00:01:18	00:01:19	Hey! Come on! Whoa. Hey! It wasn't me.
39	00:01:19	00:01:21	Don't look at me. Oh, yeah.
40	00:01:30	00:01:36	So, when I was a teenager, we used to go skinny-dipping in a quarry in New Jersey.
41	00:01:36	00:01:38	Ran into a few bodies.
42	00:01:38	00:01:41	Most of them were wearing cement shoes.
43	00:01:41	00:01:43	And all of them were named Anthony.
44	00:01:43	00:01:46	Back in the good old days, when the Mob really knew how to take care of business? Ah, yeah.
45	00:01:47	00:01:50	Actually, it's kind of nice in here.
46	00:01:50	00:01:51	Yeah, maybe if you hold your nose.
47	00:01:51	00:01:55	Sulfur spring. You know, if you bathe in this water every day, you can have a really beautiful complexion.
48	00:01:55	00:01:57	Oh, yeah?
49	00:01:57	00:01:58	I got you. Okay.
50	00:02:04	00:02:05	Yeah, his complexion's definitely improved.
51	00:02:05	00:02:09	Oh.
52	00:02:09	00:02:11	Blood exuding from the right nares.
53	00:02:11	00:02:15	Probable internal head trauma on that side.
54	00:02:15	00:02:17	Interesting pattern to this wound.
55	00:02:17	00:02:19	Maybe he hit his head on the rocks?
56	00:02:19	00:02:21	Well, it's an L-shaped wound, so, not a rock.
57	00:02:21	00:02:23	Probably a pistol butt.
58	00:02:33	00:02:35	No pruning on the volar pads.
59	00:02:35	00:02:39	That means he was dead before he hit the water or very soon after.
60	00:02:39	00:02:41	Well, maybe there was a struggle at the edge of the water.
61	00:02:41	00:02:42	Or a body dump.
62	00:02:44	00:02:46	Shirt's torn.
63	00:02:46	00:02:52	Ambient temp's 97, water's 107, and the liver temp is 106.5.
64	00:02:52	00:02:56	So, calculated PMI is four to seven hours.
65	00:02:56	00:02:59	Well, air unit didn't see any other cars, except the kids' Jeep.
66	00:02:59	00:03:03	Guy's out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night...
67	00:03:03	00:03:04	How'd he get out here?
68	00:03:04	00:03:08	And who was he with?
69	00:04:02	00:04:05	Hey, it's hot out here. Stay hydrated.
70	00:04:05	00:04:06	Yeah.
71	00:04:06	00:04:07	Thanks. Let me show you something.
72	00:04:07	00:04:09	Okay, what haveyou got?
73	00:04:09	00:04:13	Now, this soil's pretty hard packed, so even if there was another vehicle out here, we probably wouldn't know it.
74	00:04:13	00:04:14	Mm-hmm.
75	00:04:14	00:04:16	But I did find something interesting here.
76	00:04:16	00:04:18	This is a fresh motor oil deposit.
77	00:04:19	00:04:22	The color of it tells me it's been in the engine for a while.
78	00:04:22	00:04:26	Someone had a leak. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it's not from the kid's Jeep, or one of ours.
79	00:04:26	00:04:29	Could be how the John Doe got out here.
80	00:04:35	00:04:37	Mrs. Robbins has a birthday.
81	00:04:37	00:04:39	The big one.
82	00:04:39	00:04:41	She doesn't want to make much of it, which means I have to.
83	00:04:41	00:04:42	You got any ideas?
84	00:04:42	00:04:45	Can't go wrong with diamonds.
85	00:04:45	00:04:47	Girl's BFF.
86	00:04:47	00:04:48	Man's worst enemy.
87	00:04:48	00:04:51	What about a nice pair of yellow-metal earrings?
88	00:04:51	00:04:53	Oh, come on, Doc.
89	00:04:53	00:04:55	You can say the word.
90	00:04:55	00:04:57	Gold for her 50th?
91	00:04:57	00:04:59	I mean, it's okay.
92	00:04:59	00:05:01	Just add a few carats.
93	00:05:01	00:05:03	You'll thank me for it later.
94	00:05:05	00:05:06	Any thoughts on C.O.D.?
95	00:05:07	00:05:15	We can rule out the L-shaped laceration and associated blunt force trauma to the head, because there was no damage to the skull.
96	00:05:15	00:05:18	I can't say the same for the rest of him.
97	00:05:18	00:05:20	He was a smorgasbord of disease.
98	00:05:20	00:05:22	Liver's enlarged and necrotic.
99	00:05:22	00:05:26	The brain and the kidneys are peppered with precancerous lesions.
100	00:05:26	00:05:31	The gastrointestinal tract looks like it's been scrubbed with steel wool.
101	00:05:31	00:05:34	Plus there was nerve tissue degeneration.
102	00:05:34	00:05:35	How old was he?
103	00:05:35	00:05:37	Not old enough for all of this.
104	00:05:38	00:05:42	He was a very sick man with a seriously-shortened life expectancy.
105	00:05:42	00:05:44	So, what did--kill him?
106	00:05:44	00:05:47	I was just getting to that.
107	00:05:54	00:05:56	He drowned.
108	00:05:58	00:06:08	When the water passed through his larynx, it caused a reflexive spasm, and that sealed the airway, making it impossible for him to breathe.
109	00:06:08	00:06:16	Not so good for him, but good for us, because it locked a sample of the water that killed him into his vocal folds.
110	00:06:16	00:06:24	Well, if he did drown in that hot spring, the water sample that Ray collected should match what you've got in that syringe.
111	00:06:27	00:06:29	Looks like two different sources to me.
112	00:06:29	00:06:35	Trace will have to confirm, but I would say that our friend here did not drown in that spring.
113	00:07:16	00:07:20	Floater's prints came back to a Walter Burns.
114	00:07:20	00:07:22	In the system for assault, 25 years ago.
115	00:07:22	00:07:25	He got into a bar fight over a girl, but no record since then.
116	00:07:25	00:07:27	Not exactly a hardened criminal.
117	00:07:27	00:07:28	No.
118	00:07:28	00:07:32	You check DMV? Burns lived on a ranch in Cable Springs.
119	00:07:32	00:07:36	Not far from where we found him. He owed a pickup, so, Brass put a broadcast out on the plates.
120	00:07:36	00:07:38	Sent a couple of unis over to the ranch.
121	00:07:38	00:07:40	No truck. Not much of anything, really.
122	00:07:40	00:07:42	The place had pretty much gone to seed.
123	00:07:42	00:07:43	Next of kin?
124	00:07:43	00:07:46	Had a wife, but she died last year.
125	00:07:46	00:07:48	I checked Walter Burns' phone records.
126	00:07:48	00:07:51	Apparently, he didn't have many friends, except maybe one.
127	00:07:51	00:07:55	More than a dozen calls made back and forth in the last week.
128	00:07:55	00:07:56	Rosalind Johnson?
129	00:07:56	00:07:58	She is the editor of the Cable Springs Courier.
130	00:07:58	00:08:03	Editor, publisher, lead reporter, advertising rep.
131	00:08:03	00:08:05	And I sweep the place out every night.
132	00:08:05	00:08:08	So, what capacity were you calling Walter Burns three times a day?
133	00:08:09	00:08:11	Walter is a source for a story I'm working on. What story?
134	00:08:11	00:08:16	Not at liberty to say, but you'll be reading about it soon enough.
135	00:08:16	00:08:18	Drop the Woodward and Bernstein act, okay?
136	00:08:18	00:08:22	Your source, Walter Burns, was found dead last night.
137	00:08:23	00:08:25	Oh...
138	00:08:26	00:08:30	Your phone records indicate you were the last person to speak with him.
139	00:08:30	00:08:32	So?
140	00:08:33	00:08:36	What happened?
141	00:08:36	00:08:37	I'm not at liberty to say.
142	00:08:38	00:08:41	Fair enough.
143	00:08:42	00:08:44	How about a little give and take?
144	00:08:44	00:08:45	I help you, you help me.
145	00:08:45	00:08:47	Starting with how Walter died.
146	00:08:47	00:08:50	No. Let's start with what you and Walter talked about last night.
147	00:08:50	00:08:52	We talked about Cable Springs.
148	00:08:52	00:08:54	About his ranch, his health.
149	00:08:54	00:08:56	Your turn.
150	00:08:59	00:09:01	Walter was a very sick man.
151	00:09:01	00:09:03	You do an autopsy?
152	00:09:03	00:09:05	Yes.
153	00:09:05	00:09:08	He was riddled with systemic lesions, amongst other things.
154	00:09:08	00:09:10	Can I see the report?
155	00:09:10	00:09:11	Can I see your story?
156	00:09:11	00:09:14	Do I need to remind you of my First Amendment rights?
157	00:09:14	00:09:18	Ms. Johnson, we can get a court order and subpoena your notes and sources.
158	00:09:18	00:09:20	And I'll go to jail before I give them up.
159	00:09:23	00:09:24	Am I free to go?
160	00:09:24	00:09:25	Just don't go far.
161	00:09:30	00:09:32	Oh, um, Walter's wife was sick, too.
162	00:09:32	00:09:34	You might want to look into that.
163	00:09:36	00:09:38	That's on the house.
164	00:09:39	00:09:41	Reporters.
165	00:09:44	00:09:46	Hey, Archie.
166	00:09:46	00:09:47	Hey.
167	00:09:48	00:09:50	I got your text. What's going on?
168	00:09:50	00:09:52	This vehicle.
169	00:09:52	00:09:54	Found in an empty lot near Fremont.
170	00:09:54	00:09:55	No driver.
171	00:09:55	00:09:57	It looks like blood on the outside here.
172	00:09:58	00:09:59	Yeah, that's never good.
173	00:09:59	00:10:00	We can't get to it right now, man.
174	00:10:00	00:10:01	We're working the Walter Burns case.
175	00:10:02	00:10:04	This is--the Walter Burns case.
176	00:10:04	00:10:06	He drove a pickup. I know.
177	00:10:06	00:10:07	Check this out.
178	00:10:07	00:10:10	This Escalade is equipped with an aftermarket navigation system.
179	00:10:10	00:10:13	It's full of goodies.
180	00:10:13	00:10:16	Okay, what are you looking at right now?
181	00:10:16	00:10:20	1901 Old Ranch Road, Cable Springs.
182	00:10:20	00:10:22	That's Walter Burns' property.
183	00:10:22	00:10:23	Who's the registered owner?
184	00:10:24	00:10:26	Richard Adams.
185	00:10:26	00:10:27	Also from Cable Springs.
186	00:10:27	00:10:30	Been to Walter Burns' property half a dozen times.
187	00:10:30	00:10:32	Really?
188	00:10:32	00:10:34	What about the hot springs, last night?
189	00:10:34	00:10:35	No.
190	00:10:36	00:10:45	According to the system, the last trip started in Cable Springs around Main Street, and ended just around Fremont and Nordling where the cops found it.
191	00:10:45	00:10:47	Positive for blood.
192	00:10:54	00:10:57	Expended nine millimeter cartridge casing.
193	00:10:57	00:11:03	Ejector and extractor marks are consistent with a Beretta, or a Taurus semi-auto.
194	00:11:03	00:11:10	So the gun is fired inside the car, but instead of the blood being on the inside, it's on the outside.
195	00:11:15	00:11:16	Amylase bubbles.
196	00:11:17	00:11:18	Amylase indicates saliva.
197	00:11:19	00:11:21	That's consistent with a gunshot wound to the chest.
198	00:11:21	00:11:27	You know, I'm thinking, the shooter sat right here in this seat, told the driver to get out.
199	00:11:27	00:11:30	Please... don't...
200	00:11:30	00:11:33	don't do this. I... I have a family.
201	00:11:35	00:11:46	During expiration, blood is forced into the throat, which induces violent coughing, breaking the blood up into tiny droplets that mix with amylase, aka saliva.
202	00:11:46	00:11:50	Assuming Richard Adams is the victim, what happened to him?
203	00:11:51	00:11:52	Cops searched the area around the lot.
204	00:11:52	00:11:53	They didn't find anything.
205	00:11:54	00:11:56	No... body, no blood pool.
206	00:11:56	00:11:57	So where did all this happen?
207	00:11:57	00:12:00	I'm betting the answer's in here.
208	00:12:06	00:12:12	Nothing throws cold water on a guy's libido like a couple of cops out for a midnight stroll.
209	00:12:12	00:12:14	Hey, Sheila, roll up the sidewalk.
210	00:12:15	00:12:16	We're gonna be a while.
211	00:12:16	00:12:19	You, hey, different story; zero tolerance.
212	00:12:19	00:12:23	I see you again, I'm gonna give you a ride home to your wife.
213	00:12:23	00:12:25	That's good PR.
214	00:12:25	00:12:28	I try.
215	00:12:28	00:12:29	I spoke with Richard Adams' wife.
216	00:12:30	00:12:33	00 from the office.
217	00:12:33	00:12:37	The guy's an engineer with a local gas company-- Conservo Solutions.
218	00:12:37	00:12:39	He said he was on his way home.
219	00:12:39	00:12:41	Where's his office?
220	00:12:41	00:12:42	Cable Springs.
221	00:12:42	00:12:44	Yeah? On Main Street?
222	00:12:44	00:12:46	What, do you do tarot readings on the side?
223	00:12:46	00:12:48	Ha-ha.
224	00:12:48	00:12:50	Adams lives and works in Cable Springs.
225	00:12:50	00:12:52	This ain't Cable Springs.
226	00:12:52	00:12:54	No, it is not.
227	00:12:54	00:12:57	Hey! Uh, excuse me.
228	00:12:57	00:12:58	Carry on.
229	00:12:58	00:13:03	Well, the navigation system in his car said he stopped around here for a couple minutes.
230	00:13:03	00:13:05	To remove the blood spatter from the car.
231	00:13:05	00:13:08	I figure him for a $50 recreational detour.
232	00:13:08	00:13:10	Mm. Maybe that's what the killer wanted us to think.
233	00:13:11	00:13:15	So they abduct him from his office, and they drive him to Vegas, to Hooker Alley?
234	00:13:15	00:13:17	That's premeditation.
235	00:13:17	00:13:19	Here we go.
236	00:13:22	00:13:24	Looks like we got some blood here.
237	00:13:41	00:13:44	Divot in the pavement, some dry blood...
238	00:13:44	00:13:48	Looks like a piece of bone-- I think it's skull fragment.
239	00:13:48	00:13:53	You know, Adams was probably already down when he was shot the second time.
240	00:14:00	00:14:02	Spent casing.
241	00:14:03	00:14:05	Head stamp nine mil.
242	00:14:05	00:14:09	Yeah, it's the same brand as the nine mil I found in Adams' car.
243	00:14:09	00:14:12	So the guy has been shot at least twice.
244	00:14:12	00:14:14	Body couldn't be far.
245	00:14:14	00:14:15	Uh-huh.
246	00:14:17	00:14:19	Drag marks.
247	00:14:35	00:14:36	Well, there he is.
248	00:14:36	00:14:37	Hello, Richard.
249	00:14:49	00:14:50	Pretty wife.
250	00:14:50	00:14:53	Wonder if he called anybody else last night.
251	00:14:54	00:14:56	Bingo.
252	00:14:58	00:15:00	What, you just gonna call it right now?
253	00:15:00	00:15:01	(line ringing) All right.
254	00:15:02	00:15:06	You've reached Rosalind Johnson at the Cable Springs Courier.
255	00:15:06	00:15:10	I can't take your call right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you.
256	00:15:10	00:15:14	So, Richard Adams, our dead engineer here, knew Walter Burns, our dead rancher.
257	00:15:14	00:15:19	Adams was killed less than a day after Burns, and they both made one final call to Rosalind Johnson?
258	00:15:19	00:15:21	She sure has a knack for interviewing dead guys.
259	00:15:22	00:15:25	Two dead bodies in 24 hours.
260	00:15:25	00:15:29	That must be one hell of a story she's writing.
261	00:15:41	00:15:45	Richard had been on edge for weeks.
262	00:15:45	00:15:47	Even my sister noticed it.
263	00:15:47	00:15:51	He would check the locks at night, and then he would check them again.
264	00:15:51	00:15:56	(sighs) He was convinced that someone was following him, but he wouldn't tell me who.
265	00:15:56	00:15:59	Your husband was an engineer at Conservo Solutions.
266	00:15:59	00:16:01	What exactly did he do there?
267	00:16:01	00:16:03	He was a safety inspector.
268	00:16:03	00:16:13	Conservo Solution's drilling for natural gas in... the neighborhood, and so he would go around to the ranches, and he would... just make sure there were no problems.
269	00:16:13	00:16:17	He went to visit a rancher named Walter Burns several times.
270	00:16:17	00:16:20	He visited a lot of ranchers.
271	00:16:20	00:16:22	Anyone who complained.
272	00:16:22	00:16:23	What did they complain about?
273	00:16:25	00:16:27	(sighs) You have to ask the company.
274	00:16:29	00:16:33	What can you tell me about a woman named Rosalind Johnson?
275	00:16:33	00:16:34	You mean that reporter?
276	00:16:34	00:16:37	She was in close contact with your husband.
277	00:16:37	00:16:39	She called him the night he died.
278	00:16:39	00:16:41	She called him all the time.
279	00:16:41	00:16:43	She was working on some story.
280	00:16:43	00:16:45	And are you certain that was the extent of their relationship?
281	00:16:45	00:16:49	Are you suggesting he was having an affair with her?
282	00:16:49	00:16:50	No. No way.
283	00:16:50	00:16:53	Richard didn't even want to talk to her, but she was so pushy.
284	00:16:53	00:16:55	And do you know what they talked about?
285	00:16:55	00:16:57	The woman had a bug up her ass about the drilling.
286	00:16:57	00:16:59	She was convinced that it wasn't...
287	00:16:59	00:17:00	That it wasn't what?
288	00:17:03	00:17:06	I can't talk to you about company business.
289	00:17:06	00:17:08	Ms. Adams...
290	00:17:08	00:17:12	Conservo Solution employees and their families all sign nondisclosure agreements.
291	00:17:12	00:17:15	If I violate it, I will lose all of Richard's benefits.
292	00:17:15	00:17:18	I can't afford that; I have a son in college.
293	00:17:18	00:17:22	Ms. Adams... someone has murdered your husband.
294	00:17:22	00:17:25	Now, if you know something, you gotta tell me.
295	00:17:28	00:17:31	What, did somebody threaten you?
296	00:17:31	00:17:32	Hmm?
297	00:17:32	00:17:34	Someone from that company?
298	00:17:37	00:17:39	Not from the company.
299	00:17:48	00:17:50	Goat's head?!
300	00:17:50	00:17:54	Someone left this on your front porch?
301	00:17:54	00:17:56	When?
302	00:17:56	00:17:58	The day before yesterday.
303	00:17:58	00:18:00	The day before your husband died?
304	00:18:02	00:18:04	Okay.
305	00:18:04	00:18:08	Was it in this bag when you found it? No, it was in that box.
306	00:18:18	00:18:23	Bug spray should keep the creepy crawlies contained.
307	00:18:23	00:18:25	Second instar maggots.
308	00:18:25	00:18:28	Been dead at least 24 hours.
309	00:18:28	00:18:30	This looks like a hatchet job.
310	00:18:30	00:18:32	Tissue's necrotic.
311	00:18:32	00:18:35	No contusions on the wounds caused by the hatchet.
312	00:18:35	00:18:39	Yeah, this animal was dead before someone separated it from its head.
313	00:18:44	00:18:47	Oh, dear. Ooh.
314	00:18:47	00:18:51	Dozens of lesions, just like our floater Walter Burns.
315	00:18:51	00:18:53	Could they have had the same disease?
316	00:18:53	00:18:56	Well, maybe it's our goat's C.O.D.
317	00:18:56	00:18:59	Why would you leave an infected goat's head on someone's doorstep?
318	00:18:59	00:19:01	I'll take that one.
319	00:19:01	00:19:04	I've seen The Godfather--11 times-- this was a message.
320	00:19:04	00:19:08	Ah. It's not a horse head, but, uh, hey, times are tough.
321	00:19:08	00:19:11	So we have...
322	00:19:11	00:19:20	a rancher and a goat showing similar gross pathology, both with connections to Cable Springs and...
323	00:19:20	00:19:21	the Conservo engineer.
324	00:19:22	00:19:25	So we'll let this culture grow overnight.
325	00:19:25	00:19:30	I already popped some lesion pus from a rancher, and I'll pull his tissue slides for comparison.
326	00:19:30	00:19:33	And maybe we'll get an answer to this medical mystery.
327	00:20:03	00:20:04	How's it going?
328	00:20:04	00:20:07	Found a bloody print on the inside of the box.
329	00:20:07	00:20:09	Blood's not human.
330	00:20:09	00:20:10	It's all goat's blood?
331	00:20:10	00:20:15	Well, as soon as they develop a presumptive test for goat's blood, I'll let you know.
332	00:20:15	00:20:17	But in the meantime, the print's pretty good.
333	00:20:17	00:20:21	It's got a right-slant loop, a core and a delta.
334	00:20:21	00:20:26	I've been downloading all the images from Richard Adams' cell phone.
335	00:20:26	00:20:28	You got to see this.
336	00:20:32	00:20:34	That's my goat. You sure?
337	00:20:34	00:20:37	Yeah, the left horn is damaged, just like the one I found.
338	00:20:40	00:20:41	See there?
339	00:20:41	00:20:44	Hey, did you get latitude and longitude within the metadata?
340	00:20:44	00:20:47	Sorry. Haven't gotten that far yet.
341	00:20:47	00:20:49	I was getting a little excited.
342	00:20:49	00:20:53	There we go-- 1903 Old Ranch Road.
343	00:20:53	00:20:56	That's right down the road from Walter Burns' property.
344	00:20:56	00:20:58	Well, maybe his neighbor's got the rest of your billy goat.
345	00:20:58	00:21:00	And the nine millimeter and the truck with an oil leak.
346	00:21:00	00:21:04	You think he killed Walter Burns and--Richard Adams?
347	00:21:04	00:21:06	I'll ask him when I get there.
348	00:21:06	00:21:08	I'll run the print. All right.
349	00:21:33	00:21:35	Gas company's drilling right in his lap.
350	00:21:35	00:21:38	I checked out the owner of this place, Bill Gibson.
351	00:21:38	00:21:40	No priors. He's been here for 40 years.
352	00:21:40	00:21:45	His work card's on file. Well, if his prints are on that box, Greg should be able to get a match.
353	00:21:45	00:21:47	It's not exactly a thriving enterprise.
354	00:21:47	00:21:50	I didn't see any livestock.
355	00:21:50	00:21:51	What do you got, Nick?
356	00:21:51	00:21:53	No oil leak.
357	00:21:53	00:21:55	But he could've fixed it by now.
358	00:21:55	00:21:57	Let's see if Mr. Gibson's here.
359	00:22:01	00:22:04	I got point-- don't shoot me in the ass.
360	00:22:07	00:22:09	Mr. Gibson, LVPD!
361	00:22:16	00:22:19	What the hell you people doing on my property?
362	00:22:19	00:22:22	Sir, put the animal down; show me your hands.
363	00:22:30	00:22:32	You want to tell me what this is about?
364	00:22:32	00:22:34	Why don't you tell us why you shot that goat?
365	00:22:34	00:22:38	'Cause he was sick, and I'm putting him out of his misery.
366	00:22:38	00:22:40	You gonna cut that one's head off, too?
367	00:22:40	00:22:41	Throw it on somebody's porch?
368	00:22:41	00:22:44	Is that why you're here, you think I killed that engineer?
369	00:22:44	00:22:45	Did you? No!
370	00:22:45	00:22:48	What about your neighbor, Walter Burns?
371	00:22:48	00:22:51	Walter was a friend, so was his wife.
372	00:22:51	00:22:54	In a way, he was lucky.
373	00:22:54	00:22:56	He got put out of his misery, too.
374	00:22:56	00:22:59	Sir, we're gonna need you to come to Vegas and answer some questions.
375	00:22:59	00:23:03	This place may not look like much, but there's only one way I'm leaving.
376	00:23:03	00:23:05	I don't want to shoot you, sir.
377	00:23:05	00:23:08	We don't want any trouble, now, Mr. Gibson.
378	00:23:08	00:23:12	Mr. Gibson, you haven't been feeling well lately, have you?
379	00:23:12	00:23:15	What do you care?
380	00:23:15	00:23:20	You know, 40 years, I get good, sweet water from my well.
381	00:23:20	00:23:21	40 years!
382	00:23:21	00:23:26	You want to know how much the gas company paid me for my mineral rights?
383	00:23:26	00:23:28	$50,000.
384	00:23:28	00:23:33	Only covered one round of my wife's chemo.
385	00:23:33	00:23:34	Your wife had cancer?
386	00:23:34	00:23:38	Just like Walter's wife, like a whole lot of other people around here.
387	00:23:38	00:23:44	You know, I called... the Water District, the mayor, the EPA, but nobody cared.
388	00:23:44	00:23:46	We care, Mr. Gibson.
389	00:23:46	00:23:51	Now, Walter was gonna get proof that Conservo Solutions was poisoning us!
390	00:23:51	00:23:53	Then he turns up dead!
391	00:23:53	00:23:55	Sir, I'm not gonna ask you again.
392	00:23:55	00:23:57	You won't have to.
393	00:23:59	00:24:01	I buried my wife.
394	00:24:04	00:24:06	Now I'm burying my last animal.
395	00:24:06	00:24:08	I ain't got nothin' left.
396	00:24:08	00:24:15	Oh, and now you folks from the county finally come down here, accuse me of murder.
397	00:24:15	00:24:18	We only want to understand what's going on.
398	00:24:18	00:24:19	You want to understand?
399	00:24:22	00:24:24	Let me show you.
400	00:24:46	00:24:50	I don't see any evidence of any kind of explosive device in there.
401	00:24:50	00:24:54	I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but water's not supposed to blow up like that.
402	00:24:54	00:25:01	Wasn't there a river in Ohio a long time ago that was so polluted that it caught on fire?
403	00:25:01	00:25:03	The Cuyahoga, just outside of Cleveland.
404	00:25:03	00:25:06	You know, I had a cousin who lived there.
405	00:25:06	00:25:08	He said the water didn't flow, it oozed.
406	00:25:08	00:25:13	Said if you got in that river water, you'd probably dissolve before you'd drown.
407	00:25:13	00:25:15	It's what started the Clean Water Act.
408	00:25:15	00:25:17	Maybe we got the same thing here.
409	00:25:17	00:25:18	Maybe.
410	00:25:19	00:25:21	What are you thinking?
411	00:25:21	00:25:23	Well...
412	00:25:25	00:25:30	I don't mean to insult your--intelligence, Nick, but...
413	00:25:30	00:25:34	water's not supposed to bubble like that unless it's Perrier.
414	00:25:35	00:25:37	Smell that.
415	00:25:37	00:25:38	Serious chemical odor.
416	00:25:38	00:25:43	Yeah, I smell it-- but the main component of natural gas is methane, and it's odorless.
417	00:25:43	00:25:45	Odorless... but highly flammable.
418	00:25:46	00:25:48	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
419	00:25:48	00:25:51	What are you doing? Just a little science. Relax.
420	00:25:52	00:25:54	You're a smart guy.
421	00:25:59	00:26:00	So...
422	00:26:00	00:26:05	Mr. Gibson's water contains methane.
423	00:26:05	00:26:12	Yeah, and who knows what else? Well, I'd bet that it's that what else that's got all these people around here and their animals sick.
424	00:26:22	00:26:25	Ms. Johnson, would you come inside, please?
425	00:26:27	00:26:29	I heard Bill Gibson is dead.
426	00:26:29	00:26:32	I'm not authorized to make public statements about an active investigation.
427	00:26:32	00:26:34	What the hell happened?
428	00:26:34	00:26:35	You have to talk to the PIO.
429	00:26:35	00:26:38	Thanks for your time.
430	00:26:38	00:26:39	I can--talk off the record.
431	00:26:42	00:26:43	Please.
432	00:26:54	00:26:55	So, talk.
433	00:26:55	00:26:58	There's a problem with Bill Gibson's well water.
434	00:26:58	00:27:03	We suspect there's a similar problem with the well water in the surrounding ranches.
435	00:27:03	00:27:07	Tell me something that everybody in Cable Springs doesn't already know. All right.
436	00:27:07	00:27:10	Richard Adams was the engineer who ran the safety inspections.
437	00:27:10	00:27:16	The GPS on his Escalade showed that he visited ranches in the surrounding area.
438	00:27:16	00:27:18	He knew there was a problem with the water.
439	00:27:18	00:27:21	Which means Conservo knew as well.
440	00:27:21	00:27:23	I could have told you that.
441	00:27:23	00:27:30	Ms. Johnson, can you tell me why you think Bill Gibson, Walter Burns and Richard Adams are all dead?
442	00:27:33	00:27:35	Because...
443	00:27:35	00:27:38	they figured out a year ago what you're just figuring out now.
444	00:27:38	00:27:43	Conservo was taking shortcuts, ignoring safety protocols.
445	00:27:43	00:27:45	Gibson and Burns tried to do something about it.
446	00:27:45	00:27:47	Did you know they were both sick?
447	00:27:47	00:27:51	Lots of sick people in Cable Springs.
448	00:27:52	00:27:54	Have you seen your doctor recently?
449	00:27:57	00:27:59	Yeah.
450	00:27:59	00:28:02	You can read about it in my article.
451	00:28:02	00:28:04	Which is coming out when?
452	00:28:04	00:28:08	Unfortunately, all my sources keep dying on me.
453	00:28:08	00:28:12	And I'm still missing one crucial piece of the puzzle.
454	00:28:12	00:28:15	Have you ever heard of fracking?
455	00:28:15	00:28:17	Sounds like a sci-fi expletive.
456	00:28:17	00:28:19	Look it up.
457	00:28:19	00:28:21	And then give me a call.
458	00:28:23	00:28:24	Very well.
459	00:28:36	00:28:38	I'm not gonna touch anything.
460	00:28:38	00:28:40	Good.
461	00:28:40	00:28:44	Those the results from the water samples? Yeah.
462	00:28:44	00:28:46	Hand 'em over.
463	00:28:46	00:28:51	I analyzed the sample we collected from Mr. Gibson's well.
464	00:28:51	00:28:56	Methane, fumaric acid, barite, ammonium silicate...
465	00:28:58	00:29:00	Glutaraldehyde?! Benzene?!
466	00:29:00	00:29:01	Huge carcinogen.
467	00:29:01	00:29:05	5-Chloro-2-methyl-4- isothiazolin-3-one.
468	00:29:05	00:29:16	All of these chemicals are implicated in cardiovascular and respiratory disorder, endocrine disruption, gastroenterological failure, nerve and urinary system destruction...
469	00:29:16	00:29:23	Yeah, uh, bad for you-- I get it. I've been examining the bacterial culture for Mr. Burns' brain lesions.
470	00:29:23	00:29:25	Come on over here.
471	00:29:25	00:29:26	Come on.
472	00:29:27	00:29:28	This way.
473	00:29:30	00:29:32	Take a look.
474	00:29:33	00:29:35	I don't need a mask, do I?
475	00:29:35	00:29:37	No.
476	00:29:42	00:29:43	Ooh.
477	00:29:43	00:29:44	Nasty.
478	00:29:44	00:29:47	I'd hate to have those floating around my colon.
479	00:29:47	00:29:48	Or anywhere else.
480	00:29:48	00:29:49	They like necrotic tissue.
481	00:29:49	00:29:51	But the real story is in the histo.
482	00:29:51	00:29:56	The slides confirm Walter Burns was suffering from metastatic carcinoma.
483	00:29:56	00:30:04	I pulled the clinical autopsy reports on Gibson's wife and Mrs. Burns-- they both died from metastatic carcinomas.
484	00:30:04	00:30:08	Because maybe... they were drinking bad water.
485	00:30:08	00:30:14	This is the analysis from the water found in the vocal folds of your hot springs floater.
486	00:30:14	00:30:18	You see, it's the same toxins, but much higher concentrations.
487	00:30:18	00:30:24	So Walter Burns may have drowned in the source--of the contamination.
488	00:30:24	00:30:29	If these chemicals are in the water supply in Cable Springs, we have a major public health emergency.
489	00:30:29	00:30:30	We need to warn people.
490	00:30:30	00:30:32	And tell them what?
491	00:30:32	00:30:36	A water sample from one well is hardly proof of widespread contamination.
492	00:30:36	00:30:38	I found it.What?
493	00:30:39	00:30:41	What Rosalind Johnson was talking about-- fracking.
494	00:30:41	00:30:43	It's short for hydraulic fracturing.
495	00:30:43	00:30:48	It's a process used to obtain natural gas from shale rock.
496	00:30:49	00:30:52	Conservo Solutions pioneered the process in Nevada.
497	00:30:52	00:30:55	They drill until they hit gas-bearing shale.
498	00:30:55	00:31:00	Then they pump millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into the hole.
499	00:31:00	00:31:04	This creates miniature earthquakes breaking up the rock, releasing the gas.
500	00:31:04	00:31:10	So they're drilling right through the aquifer in Cable Springs, where everyone gets their drinking water.
501	00:31:10	00:31:18	What happens to all the chemicals they put down the hole? It says here that half the fracking fluid comes up with the gas, gets pumped into an evaporation pool.
502	00:31:20	00:31:22	And the rest remains underground?
503	00:31:22	00:31:28	If industry safety protocols aren't followed, methane in the fracking fluid enters the groundwater.
504	00:31:28	00:31:37	Which means that if a farmer or a rancher is pumping water from his well, gas comes up with it, it mixes with the air-- it creates an extremely combustible mixture.
505	00:31:46	00:31:51	Well, Conservo Solutions had to file an environmental impact study before they started drilling.
506	00:31:51	00:31:53	There was no study.
507	00:31:53	00:32:01	Since 2005, gas companies haven't been bound by the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or the National Environmental Policy Act.
508	00:32:01	00:32:06	So I'll do my civic duty and I'll call the Health Department, while you guys are solving crimes.
509	00:32:06	00:32:07	The water's the crime.
510	00:32:07	00:32:09	Seriously, it's not Chinatown,--Ray.
511	00:32:12	00:32:14	Okay. Be more specific.
512	00:32:15	00:32:22	Now, this is a trace report on the oil that Nick found at the hot springs-- it contained soot, which tells us it came from a diesel engine.
513	00:32:22	00:32:25	It also contained titanium at 114 ppm.
514	00:32:25	00:32:27	That's an additive used in commercial fleets.
515	00:32:27	00:32:29	Which tells us it came from a commercial-grade vehicle.
516	00:32:29	00:32:34	The only commercial fleet in Cable Springs belongs to Conservo Solutions.
517	00:32:34	00:32:37	Richard Adams was their employee.
518	00:32:37	00:32:41	Walter Burns and Bill Gibson both leased their mineral rights to the company.
519	00:32:41	00:32:43	Well, I'm not sure that's enough for a warrant.
520	00:32:43	00:32:47	Whoever drowned Walter Burns was driving a commercial diesel truck.
521	00:32:47	00:32:49	The same person probably killed Richard Adams.
522	00:32:49	00:32:53	Get us the warrant, Conrad.
523	00:33:28	00:33:30	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
524	00:33:30	00:33:32	Can I help you, Officers?
525	00:33:32	00:33:33	You sure can, big man.
526	00:33:34	00:33:36	I gotta take a look at your trucks.
527	00:33:36	00:33:37	Why?
528	00:33:37	00:33:40	'Cause that piece of paper says so.
529	00:33:44	00:33:46	Excuse me.
530	00:33:46	00:33:48	Do you guys have a gym on site, as well?
531	00:33:48	00:33:50	What are you talking about?
532	00:33:50	00:33:52	Well, I see you have a nice little lap pool here.
533	00:33:52	00:33:54	No, no, no. That's for the bunny huggers.
534	00:33:54	00:33:56	Environmental regs. It's an evaporation pool.
535	00:33:56	00:33:58	For what?
536	00:33:58	00:34:00	Stuff we use for drilling, mostly water.
537	00:34:01	00:34:03	We pump it back out and store it there.
538	00:34:03	00:34:05	Fascinating!
539	00:34:41	00:34:43	Hey, partner, you mind if I use your truck?
540	00:35:08	00:35:09	Ray!
541	00:35:09	00:35:11	Yeah?
542	00:35:11	00:35:14	Got what looks like a piece of a shirt here.
543	00:35:14	00:35:19	It's the same pattern as the one that farmer was wearing that we pulled out of the lake.
544	00:35:19	00:35:20	Walter Burns?
545	00:35:20	00:35:24	Yeah, man. I think he was here.
546	00:35:25	00:35:30	Gibson said that Burns was going to get proof that Conservo Solutions was poisoning the water.
547	00:35:30	00:35:33	The proof is in that evaporation pool.
548	00:35:33	00:35:38	There's a higher concentration of chemicals there, and I bet we can get a match to the water we found in his vocal folds.
549	00:35:38	00:35:42	Yeah. Guy rips his shirt jumping the fence 'cause he wants to get a sample out of that pool.
550	00:35:42	00:35:44	Somebody spots him, hits him in the head with the butt of a gun.
551	00:35:44	00:35:46	He falls in the pool. He drowns.
552	00:35:46	00:35:49	Then they take the body out to the hot springs and dump it there.
553	00:35:49	00:35:51	Yeah, I buy that for a dollar.
554	00:35:51	00:35:52	Hey!
555	00:35:52	00:35:53	Yeah? These all the trucks you have?
556	00:35:53	00:35:56	We got a few more out on the road.
557	00:35:56	00:35:58	We need license plates and drivers' names.
558	00:35:58	00:36:00	I gotta call my boss.
559	00:36:00	00:36:02	That's gonna take some time.
560	00:36:02	00:36:04	Oh, you take all the time you need, Hoss.
561	00:36:04	00:36:06	Nothing moves till you do.
562	00:36:07	00:36:08	All right.
563	00:36:08	00:36:10	Langston.
564	00:36:10	00:36:11	Hey, Ray.
565	00:36:11	00:36:13	Found your leaky truck.
566	00:36:13	00:36:15	And then some.
567	00:36:15	00:36:17	Blood inside the cab.
568	00:36:17	00:36:21	Got a Beretta nine mil by the driver's seat.
569	00:36:21	00:36:23	You hang on to that driver. We're gonna need to talk to him.
570	00:36:23	00:36:26	Yeah? Well, he's not going anywhere.
571	00:36:26	00:36:28	He's not talking, either.
572	00:36:28	00:36:32	401A. Hit and run, fatality.
573	00:36:52	00:36:56	I have been up and down this entire godforsaken road and nobody has seen nothing.
574	00:36:56	00:36:57	No accidents, no vehicles, nothing.
575	00:36:57	00:37:00	They're all suffering from retinitis pigmentosa.
576	00:37:00	00:37:02	Well, have a look at this.
577	00:37:02	00:37:06	The valve's loose, about a quarter turn.
578	00:37:06	00:37:07	Almost never happens without human intervention.
579	00:37:07	00:37:12	I think somebody set up our trucker Cody Trimble to get a flat.
580	00:37:12	00:37:14	Slow leak. Tire goes down.
581	00:37:15	00:37:20	Trimble gets out to fix his tire, becomes the proverbial sitting duck.
582	00:37:22	00:37:25	And that takes care of Conservo's only loose end.
583	00:37:27	00:37:28	This wasn't an accident.
584	00:37:29	00:37:31	Firing one.
585	00:37:51	00:37:55	The back spatter on this pistol is consistent with the dead trucker's gun.
586	00:37:55	00:37:56	Right.
587	00:37:56	00:38:00	If DNA's a match for Richard Adams, then we've got the murder weapon and his killer.
588	00:38:00	00:38:08	The bullets and the cartridge casings from Adams' Escalade and the alley are both a match.
589	00:38:08	00:38:09	This guy Trimble made our job easy.
590	00:38:10	00:38:13	Too easy.
591	00:38:13	00:38:15	That's some blood on the lanyard ring.
592	00:38:17	00:38:19	And what looks like some hair.
593	00:38:19	00:38:22	It's the same color as Walter Burns' hair.
594	00:38:30	00:38:33	I think we know what made Walter Burns' head wound.
595	00:38:33	00:38:39	So Burns hopped the fence at Conservo Solutions, hoping to get a water sample from the evaporation pool.
596	00:38:46	00:38:49	But what he got was a Beretta to the head.
597	00:38:49	00:38:55	He drowned in that pool, which explains why he had high concentrations of fracking fluid in his vocal folds.
598	00:38:55	00:38:59	Cody Trimble drove Walter's body out to the hot springs.
599	00:38:59	00:39:01	Which we confirmed by the blood we found in Cody's truck.
600	00:39:02	00:39:03	Right. So...
601	00:39:03	00:39:06	a Conservo Solutions trucker with no priors goes on a murder spree.
602	00:39:06	00:39:09	He kills two Conservo whistle-blowers.
603	00:39:09	00:39:11	He then takes a hit for the home team?
604	00:39:13	00:39:15	That's some serious company loyalty.
605	00:39:15	00:39:17	Thank you, gentlemen.
606	00:39:24	00:39:26	That's it. Case closed.
607	00:39:26	00:39:28	What? Seriously?
608	00:39:28	00:39:31	You're going to let some corporate lawyers tell us when our investigation is over?
609	00:39:31	00:39:33	No. They're not telling you. I'm telling you.
610	00:39:33	00:39:35	You got your evidence. You got the bad guy.
611	00:39:35	00:39:36	Justice has been served.
612	00:39:36	00:39:39	Well, we still need a water sample from Conservo's evaporation pool.
613	00:39:39	00:39:41	For what?
614	00:39:41	00:39:44	Because Walter Burns drowned in fracking fluid, and the only place it can be found is in that pool.
615	00:39:45	00:39:47	You don't need a sample, because there's not going to be a trial.
616	00:39:47	00:39:48	Killer's dead.
617	00:39:48	00:39:50	Oh, like the engineer and Walter Burns?
618	00:39:50	00:39:54	Another happy accident for Conservo?
619	00:39:54	00:39:56	Et tu, Brass?
620	00:39:56	00:40:03	No one can accuse me of being a bleeding heart, but I know that someone with deep pockets hired that trucker to do their dirty work and then disposed of him.
621	00:40:03	00:40:04	Don't you want to nail those bastards?
622	00:40:04	00:40:06	Yeah. Of course I do.
623	00:40:06	00:40:08	But do you have any evidence to prove that?
624	00:40:08	00:40:14	Bill Gibson blew himself up because Conservo Solutions took everything away from him.
625	00:40:14	00:40:16	They took his ranch.
626	00:40:16	00:40:18	They took his health. They took his wife.
627	00:40:18	00:40:20	And there's hundreds of Bill Gibsons out there.
628	00:40:20	00:40:24	Catherine, you're a crime scene investigator, not Erin Brockovich.
629	00:40:26	00:40:30	What about the hit and run?
630	00:40:30	00:40:34	Keep the case open, and let me know if anything else turns up.
631	00:40:42	00:40:50	Fracking is industry slang for hydraulic fracturing. It's the method that Conservo's uses to drill for natural gas.
632	00:40:50	00:40:52	You get a gold star.
633	00:40:52	00:40:53	Thank you.
634	00:40:53	00:40:58	Walter Burns busted into Conservo's well site to steal a sample from the evaporation pool.
635	00:40:58	00:41:01	That was the missing piece of your puzzle.
636	00:41:01	00:41:03	I tried to talk Walter out of it.
637	00:41:03	00:41:09	I told him I had a better way-- an insider who was going to give me corporate documents.
638	00:41:09	00:41:13	Proof that Conservo knew they were polluting the water and they chose to cover it up.
639	00:41:13	00:41:15	And Walter didn't listen.
640	00:41:15	00:41:19	Richard Adams got himself killed before he could deliver.
641	00:41:19	00:41:21	I worked Richard for months.
642	00:41:21	00:41:24	He was the one going to those ranches.
643	00:41:24	00:41:26	He was the first to see people were dying.
644	00:41:31	00:41:34	Short, controlled breaths.
645	00:41:35	00:41:37	That's it. That's it.
646	00:41:46	00:41:50	I thought I could expose Conservo before it was too late.
647	00:41:53	00:41:58	I believed that stuff about one person can change the world.
648	00:42:02	00:42:04	Maybe I was wrong.
649	00:42:06	00:42:09	I'm not going to quit.
650	00:42:09	00:42:10	So what can you do now?
651	00:42:11	00:42:12	Publish what I have.
652	00:42:12	00:42:16	Rosalind, all you have are anecdotal accounts.
653	00:42:16	00:42:20	If you publish without the hard evidence to back it up, Conservo will bury you.
654	00:42:20	00:42:22	They will shut your newspaper down.
655	00:42:22	00:42:24	They will try.
656	00:42:24	00:42:26	That's how they win.
657	00:42:27	00:42:29	By threatening people.
658	00:42:29	00:42:31	Or buying their silence.
659	00:42:33	00:42:36	Fear is their biggest weapon.
660	00:42:36	00:42:42	But... (laughs) funny thing is, I'm not afraid anymore.
661	00:42:46	00:42:48	Guess it's 'cause I don't have much to lose.
662	00:42:51	00:42:55	I have a friend who may be able to help you.
663	00:42:55	00:42:58	She's starting a clinical trial.
664	00:42:58	00:43:01	Holding a slot open for you.
665	00:43:09	00:43:11	Least I could do.
