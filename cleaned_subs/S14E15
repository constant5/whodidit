0,00:00:01,00:00:03,(wind blowing)
1,00:00:33,00:00:36,(dog barks in distance)
2,00:00:49,00:00:51,(buzzes)
3,00:01:07,00:01:09,(siren approaching)
4,00:01:19,00:01:22,"STOKES: Man, do you know how close I was to being off the clock when you called?"
5,00:01:22,00:01:29,"Yeah, I thought about waiting ten minutes, dumping it on the day shift, but for the victim's sake I thought we'd go with the ""A"" team."
6,00:01:29,00:01:31,"Oh, boy, she looks really young."
7,00:01:31,00:01:33,CRAWFORD: 16. Just got her license.
8,00:01:33,00:01:35,Name's Debbie Logan.
9,00:01:36,00:01:38,Nevada plates. Is she local?
10,00:01:38,00:01:40,"CRAWFORD: Let's see, the address is in Rowan."
11,00:01:40,00:01:42,"That's, what, another 30 miles out?"
12,00:01:42,00:01:45,"Yeah. Car's registered to her parents, same address."
13,00:01:45,00:01:48,"No money, no phone..."
14,00:01:48,00:01:50,Could've started as a robbery.
15,00:01:50,00:01:54,"Yeah, someone whacked her in the head real good."
16,00:01:54,00:01:56,But I don't think it happened in the car.
17,00:01:56,00:01:57,There's just not enough blood.
18,00:01:57,00:02:01,She was definitely on the ground at some point.
19,00:02:01,00:02:02,Her clothes are dirty.
20,00:02:02,00:02:05,She's got what looks like blue tinsel in her hair.
21,00:02:05,00:02:06,Put a call in to her parents.
22,00:02:06,00:02:08,Didn't even know she had left the house.
23,00:02:08,00:02:09,"Thought she was still in her bed, asleep."
24,00:02:09,00:02:11,Hmm.
25,00:02:11,00:02:14,"Algebra books, Bible study books..."
26,00:02:16,00:02:18,I don't think she was a runaway.
27,00:02:18,00:02:22,"Makes you wonder where she snuck off to last night, doesn't it?"
28,00:02:22,00:02:26,"Yeah, but what I really want to know is how the hell she ended up way out here."
29,00:03:09,00:03:11,(sighs)
30,00:03:11,00:03:14,It always takes a little out of me when I see them this young.
31,00:03:19,00:03:21,ROBBINS: I know what you mean.
32,00:03:21,00:03:22,And I'm afraid the story only gets worse.
33,00:03:22,00:03:24,PHILLIPS: Found skin under her fingernails.
34,00:03:24,00:03:26,I went ahead and ordered an SAE kit.
35,00:03:26,00:03:27,And...?
36,00:03:27,00:03:29,Wet mount revealed the presence of semen.
37,00:03:29,00:03:33,"ROBBINS: That, along with vaginal bruising and the abrasions she sustained..."
38,00:03:33,00:03:36,I'd have to say she was sexually assaulted.
39,00:03:42,00:03:45,Is this wound the cause of death?
40,00:03:45,00:03:48,Blunt force trauma and the attenuating brain injuries.
41,00:03:48,00:03:51,"Time of death, somewhere between midnight and 3:00 a.m."
42,00:03:51,00:03:52,Any thoughts on a weapon?
43,00:03:52,00:03:56,"The margins are irregular and jagged, so nothing with a blade or sharp edge."
44,00:03:58,00:03:59,And this cut on her knee?
45,00:03:59,00:04:01,Pre-mortem or post?
46,00:04:01,00:04:02,"Well, let's have a look."
47,00:04:05,00:04:08,There's some sort of paper fiber stuck to it.
48,00:04:08,00:04:09,Probably bathroom tissue.
49,00:04:09,00:04:12,Maybe somebody dabbed at it to stop the bleeding.
50,00:04:12,00:04:17,"In which case, the cut was certainly prior to the fatal blow."
51,00:04:17,00:04:18,Hold on.
52,00:04:18,00:04:19,There's something else.
53,00:04:19,00:04:20,It's embedded much deeper.
54,00:04:24,00:04:25,Huh.
55,00:04:25,00:04:26,Looks like a piece of glass.
56,00:04:26,00:04:28,It is.
57,00:04:28,00:04:29,I'll get this off to Hodges.
58,00:04:41,00:04:43,ROBBINS: You-you all right?
59,00:04:43,00:04:44,Finn? You all right?
60,00:04:44,00:04:46,"Yeah. Yeah, just..."
61,00:04:46,00:04:47,Just a...
62,00:04:47,00:04:52,16-year-old girl having to face the horror of being raped and killed...
63,00:04:53,00:04:55,Just never understand it.
64,00:04:58,00:04:59,LOGAN: We didn't even know she was out.
65,00:04:59,00:05:01,We thought she was still asleep.
66,00:05:01,00:05:04,And then the detective called.
67,00:05:04,00:05:07,Was it like your daughter to sneak out of the house? No.
68,00:05:07,00:05:09,Not at all.
69,00:05:09,00:05:13,Did she say anything last night before she went to bed?
70,00:05:13,00:05:16,"I... I-I don't know, I wasn't there."
71,00:05:16,00:05:18,I was ministering to some parishioners.
72,00:05:18,00:05:20,"No, she didn't say anything."
73,00:05:20,00:05:22,It was just a normal night.
74,00:05:22,00:05:24,She did her homework and she went upstairs.
75,00:05:24,00:05:26,I don't understand.
76,00:05:26,00:05:28,Why would she have left the house?
77,00:05:28,00:05:29,Where would she go?
78,00:05:29,00:05:30,Did she have a boyfriend?
79,00:05:30,00:05:33,LOGAN: No. She never even talked about boys. That wasn't her thing.
80,00:05:34,00:05:37,"Well, uh... what was her thing?"
81,00:05:41,00:05:45,"I don't know. The usual for a 16-year-old, I guess."
82,00:05:45,00:05:47,"She hung out with her friends, she went to school..."
83,00:05:47,00:05:49,"She didn't call to say she was in any kind of trouble, did she?"
84,00:05:49,00:05:52,Actually... we have her phone.
85,00:05:52,00:05:53,We took it from her.
86,00:05:53,00:05:55,And not because she was bad.
87,00:05:55,00:05:56,Her grades had slipped.
88,00:05:56,00:05:58,She was supposed to earn her phone back.
89,00:05:58,00:06:01,"Uh, look, Mr. Russell, I know what you're thinking."
90,00:06:01,00:06:04,I minister to families all the time whose kids are out of control.
91,00:06:04,00:06:07,And that is...
92,00:06:07,00:06:09,That wasn't Debbie.
93,00:06:09,00:06:14,"She worked hard in school, she helped out around my church, she taught Bible study to the preschoolers."
94,00:06:14,00:06:16,She really was an angel.
95,00:06:37,00:06:39,Seatback to pedal is 44 inches.
96,00:06:39,00:06:42,Way too far back for our victim's height.
97,00:06:42,00:06:45,Whoever dumped the body probably adjusted the seat.
98,00:06:45,00:06:46,Someone tall.
99,00:06:46,00:06:48,"Judging from the distance, around six feet."
100,00:06:48,00:06:51,You manage to pull any prints off the button that controls the seat?
101,00:06:51,00:06:54,"No, so far everything's been smeared."
102,00:06:54,00:06:58,"I'm guessing either the killer was wearing gloves, or he wiped everything down before he bailed."
103,00:07:03,00:07:04,"It rained yesterday, right?"
104,00:07:04,00:07:06,SANDERS: Yeah. For a while.
105,00:07:06,00:07:08,This flyer isn't weathered or faded.
106,00:07:08,00:07:11,Might have been put on the car last night.
107,00:07:11,00:07:12,"""3.99 breakfast special."
108,00:07:12,00:07:14,"Patty's Diner."" Here we go."
109,00:07:16,00:07:17,Finally.
110,00:07:17,00:07:18,You got a print?
111,00:07:18,00:07:19,"Yeah, big and juicy."
112,00:07:22,00:07:24,Could be from the last person who touched the car.
113,00:07:25,00:07:27,The killer.
114,00:07:27,00:07:29,(machine humming)
115,00:07:29,00:07:31,FINLAY: Hey.
116,00:07:31,00:07:32,I know what you're going to say.
117,00:07:32,00:07:35,"""I want to be dazzled."" Oh, let's not set the bar that high."
118,00:07:35,00:07:38,What do you know about the glass fragment?
119,00:07:38,00:07:39,"Well, for starters, it's old."
120,00:07:39,00:07:41,"Oh, how old?"
121,00:07:41,00:07:42,HODGES: At least 100 years.
122,00:07:42,00:07:45,X-ray fluorescence revealed revealed a significant amount of manganese.
123,00:07:45,00:07:50,And manganese was eliminated from the glass-making process prior to the start of the First World War.
124,00:07:50,00:07:56,"Interesting fact: manganese glass is actually clear when it's produced, but then over time, sunlight turns it purple."
125,00:07:56,00:07:58,What else?
126,00:07:58,00:08:00,"Well, the glass fragment is curved."
127,00:08:00,00:08:08,"And extrapolating from the curve, I have determined that your piece came from a bottle with a base radius of a little over an inch..."
128,00:08:08,00:08:11,something like one of these apothecary bottles.
129,00:08:11,00:08:14,"Not bad, Hodges. Hey, guys."
130,00:08:14,00:08:16,I processed the semen from the sexual assault kit.
131,00:08:16,00:08:20,Semen DNA matches DNA from the tissue found under the victim's fingernails.
132,00:08:20,00:08:24,"So she fought off her attacker. Yeah, but the DNA profile isn't in the system."
133,00:08:24,00:08:25,Sorry.
134,00:08:25,00:08:27,"Oh... me, too."
135,00:08:27,00:08:30,SANDERS: Were the parents any help figuring out where their daughter was?
136,00:08:30,00:08:32,"They weren't, actually. It's kind of strange."
137,00:08:32,00:08:34,I never got any sense of connection from them.
138,00:08:34,00:08:38,"I mean, the father's out on church business all the time, but-but the mother..."
139,00:08:38,00:08:41,She didn't seem to have a clue about who her daughter really was.
140,00:08:41,00:08:43,"Well, we may have something..."
141,00:08:43,00:08:47,I found a print on the passenger-side door handle of the victim's car.
142,00:08:47,00:08:49,It matches a set of prints on this flyer.
143,00:08:49,00:08:50,What are you thinking?
144,00:08:50,00:08:54,"Well, someone might've tried to break into the victim's car last night."
145,00:08:54,00:08:56,"You know, guy goes around putting flyers on windshields."
146,00:08:56,00:09:00,Gives him the perfect opportunity to check inside for valuables.
147,00:09:00,00:09:04,"Well, I'm thinking that he saw something inside the victim's car, because he tried the handle."
148,00:09:04,00:09:05,DEBBIE: Hey! What're you doing?
149,00:09:05,00:09:07,Get away from my car!
150,00:09:07,00:09:09,(grunts)
151,00:09:09,00:09:11,(Debbie screams)
152,00:09:13,00:09:14,SANDERS: Ernesto Pe√±a.
153,00:09:14,00:09:15,Talked to your boss at the diner.
154,00:09:15,00:09:20,She said that she pays you an extra $50 bucks a week to distribute flyers after work each night.
155,00:09:20,00:09:23,"CRAWFORD: That's not a bad way to make a little extra scratch, huh?"
156,00:09:23,00:09:24,"Every little bit helps, you know?"
157,00:09:24,00:09:28,"But you also found another way to make some extra scratch, didn't you?"
158,00:09:28,00:09:29,"You lost me, man."
159,00:09:29,00:09:32,I don't know what you mean.
160,00:09:32,00:09:34,CRAWFORD: All of these were in the trunk of your car.
161,00:09:34,00:09:38,"And my guess is, when we search your apartment, we're gonna find a whole lot more."
162,00:09:38,00:09:43,"SANDERS: It's a big step though, going from breaking into cars to rape and murder."
163,00:09:43,00:09:44,"What are you talking about, man?"
164,00:09:44,00:09:47,I never hurt anybody.
165,00:09:47,00:09:50,"You did more than just hurt her, Ernesto."
166,00:09:50,00:09:51,"Hell no, man!"
167,00:09:51,00:09:52,You got the wrong guy.
168,00:09:52,00:09:54,I didn't do that.
169,00:09:54,00:09:57,SANDERS: You left your fingerprint on her car door handle and the flyer.
170,00:09:57,00:09:58,That's how we found you.
171,00:09:58,00:10:02,And when your DNA comes back a match to what we found on that girl...
172,00:10:05,00:10:06,Fine.
173,00:10:06,00:10:08,"Fine, you want to test me?"
174,00:10:08,00:10:09,Test me!
175,00:10:09,00:10:10,"You'll see, you're wrong."
176,00:10:12,00:10:13,I did not do that.
177,00:10:13,00:10:15,I didn't even break into any cars last night.
178,00:10:15,00:10:18,Then why did we find your fingerprint on her car door?
179,00:10:21,00:10:25,"I might've stopped at, like, one place on the way home."
180,00:10:25,00:10:27,All right?
181,00:10:27,00:10:34,"There were maybe a dozen cars, but nothing in there worth stealing, so I tossed the flyers in a trash can and went home, man."
182,00:10:34,00:10:36,"Please, man, I'm telling you the truth."
183,00:10:39,00:10:40,"Okay, where is this place?"
184,00:10:40,00:10:41,Where was the girl's car?
185,00:10:41,00:10:44,"Some building, man, off the highway, man, way out in Brime County."
186,00:10:44,00:10:47,How about you tell us exactly where?
187,00:11:12,00:11:14,What is this place?
188,00:11:14,00:11:16,I don't know.
189,00:11:16,00:11:18,I don't see any signs.
190,00:11:18,00:11:22,"STOKES: Yeah, and I don't see any restaurant flyers on any of these cars, either."
191,00:11:22,00:11:27,"Well, Ernesto said he left most of the in the trash."
192,00:11:32,00:11:34,"No, empty."
193,00:11:34,00:11:36,"You know, maybe this guy is just jerking us around."
194,00:11:40,00:11:44,"Then again, maybe he's not."
195,00:11:47,00:11:50,"Well, what do you think?"
196,00:11:50,00:11:51,Should we check it out?
197,00:11:56,00:11:58,All right.
198,00:11:58,00:11:59,(doorbell buzzes)
199,00:12:05,00:12:07,You must be the Harris brothers?
200,00:12:08,00:12:10,You're a little early.
201,00:12:10,00:12:12,"Yeah, well, there was no traffic, so..."
202,00:12:25,00:12:26,I'll take you guys in.
203,00:12:26,00:12:30,"Suzanne will probably be a couple of minutes, but you can get started on your selections."
204,00:12:35,00:12:39,There was a piece of this in the victim's hair.
205,00:12:39,00:12:40,She was here.
206,00:12:40,00:12:44,(music playing softly)
207,00:12:44,00:12:46,"Now, I can take your drink order whenever you like."
208,00:12:46,00:12:48,"Just let me know, but in the meantime..."
209,00:12:48,00:12:50,(bell dings)
210,00:12:50,00:12:52,...why don't you have a look at your choices?
211,00:12:55,00:12:56,(indistinct chatter)
212,00:13:04,00:13:07,"STOKES: Well, so much for our wholesome little girl."
213,00:13:09,00:13:12,Teenage Bible Studies teacher spent her last night alive in a brothel.
214,00:13:20,00:13:22,"(giggling, indistinct chatter)"
215,00:13:24,00:13:25,"Hi, handsome."
216,00:13:25,00:13:29,"Sorry, ladies, but, uh, we're here on business."
217,00:13:29,00:13:32,"You know, we have a law enforcement discount every day until 10:00."
218,00:13:32,00:13:35,"That's good to know, but, uh, not today."
219,00:13:35,00:13:37,"Oh, come on."
220,00:13:37,00:13:38,You must see something here that you're interested in.
221,00:13:38,00:13:40,(door closes)
222,00:13:40,00:13:42,"We don't want to waste your time, ladies."
223,00:13:42,00:13:43,This isn't gonna happen.
224,00:13:45,00:13:46,(sighs) I'm serious.
225,00:13:46,00:13:48,"WOMAN: You heard him, girls."
226,00:13:48,00:13:50,(indistinct chatter)
227,00:13:52,00:13:54,Gentlemen.
228,00:13:54,00:13:56,"Clearly, you're not the Harris brothers."
229,00:13:56,00:13:58,We're CSIs; we're from Las Vegas.
230,00:13:58,00:14:02,We have reason to believe that there was a young girl here last night named Debbie.
231,00:14:02,00:14:04,16 years old.
232,00:14:04,00:14:06,"This is a legal, licensed brothel."
233,00:14:06,00:14:09,Having a minor on the premises would be against the law.
234,00:14:09,00:14:11,I would never allow that.
235,00:14:11,00:14:13,Would you mind taking a look at her photo?
236,00:14:13,00:14:14,Sure.
237,00:14:16,00:14:17,She wasn't here.
238,00:14:17,00:14:20,"Don't suppose there are any, uh, security cameras around here?"
239,00:14:20,00:14:23,Footage from last night that might back up your story?
240,00:14:23,00:14:25,Cameras are bad for business.
241,00:14:25,00:14:29,My customers aren't breaking any laws.
242,00:14:29,00:14:31,"Doesn't mean they're not breaking any vows, if you know what I mean."
243,00:14:31,00:14:33,(chuckles)
244,00:14:33,00:14:34,"So, we'll just have a look around?"
245,00:14:34,00:14:35,Absolutely.
246,00:14:38,00:14:41,But under one condition.
247,00:14:41,00:14:44,If you see anything that excites you...
248,00:14:46,00:14:47,...you let me know?
249,00:14:47,00:14:48,"Yes, ma'am."
250,00:14:54,00:14:56,He's right there. Oh.
251,00:15:01,00:15:03,It's hard to imagine our victim in this place.
252,00:15:03,00:15:05,She seemed so innocent.
253,00:15:05,00:15:10,"Well, I guarantee you, every one of the girls that we just met has a father at home who'd tell you the same thing."
254,00:15:10,00:15:12,(laughter)
255,00:15:15,00:15:18,"Oh, we'll wait on that one."
256,00:15:18,00:15:20,Okay.
257,00:15:20,00:15:25,"We got, uh, the schoolroom, the red room..."
258,00:15:25,00:15:27,...Western room...
259,00:15:27,00:15:29,"...and, uh..."
260,00:15:30,00:15:31,...jungle room.
261,00:15:31,00:15:33,Which do you prefer?
262,00:15:43,00:15:45,(door creaking)
263,00:16:07,00:16:09,"Hey, Nick, come in here."
264,00:16:12,00:16:15,"So, the victim had antique glass in her knee."
265,00:16:15,00:16:16,Dust void here.
266,00:16:16,00:16:17,Bottle's missing.
267,00:16:17,00:16:19,Mm-hmm.
268,00:16:30,00:16:33,There's no broken glass in the trash can.
269,00:16:39,00:16:41,(glass shattering distantly)
270,00:16:44,00:16:47,"Well, I got some here, and it's purple."
271,00:16:52,00:16:53,(sniffs)
272,00:17:00,00:17:02,"Hey, I've got blood."
273,00:17:05,00:17:07,(indistinct conversations) MAN: Everybody out!
274,00:17:07,00:17:08,(shutter clicking)
275,00:17:08,00:17:10,MADAM SUZANNE: This is ridiculous.
276,00:17:10,00:17:12,"I told you, this is a legal brothel."
277,00:17:12,00:17:14,All of my girls are certified and licensed.
278,00:17:14,00:17:16,"Except for the 16-year-olds, right?"
279,00:17:16,00:17:19,"(scoffs) Watch your accusations, Detective."
280,00:17:19,00:17:20,"I have friends in high places. Oh, good."
281,00:17:20,00:17:23,"After we're done, you might want to give one of them a call."
282,00:17:23,00:17:25,"I won't have to wait that long. Roger, please!"
283,00:17:25,00:17:26,Do something!
284,00:17:26,00:17:28,This way.
285,00:17:28,00:17:29,Officer...
286,00:17:29,00:17:32,"No, no, Rog, Rog, that's gonna be okay."
287,00:17:32,00:17:33,"Uh, we're not gonna need your help right now."
288,00:17:33,00:17:35,I'm Roger Ridley.
289,00:17:35,00:17:37,I'm Brine County Supervisor.
290,00:17:37,00:17:42,"And I know, Suzanne can come off a little rough sometimes, but I'm here to tell you, this place is 100% above board."
291,00:17:42,00:17:45,"And is that your official position, Mr. Ridley?"
292,00:17:45,00:17:47,Or are you speaking as a satisfied customer?
293,00:17:47,00:17:49,(chuckles) Both.
294,00:17:49,00:17:51,"I mean, I've known Suzanne a long time."
295,00:17:51,00:17:53,I helped her get this place licensed.
296,00:17:53,00:17:57,So I'm just asking that you set aside some of these prejudices against prostitution.
297,00:17:57,00:18:00,"It's just a business, like any other business."
298,00:18:00,00:18:02,I'm not here because I have a problem with prostitution.
299,00:18:02,00:18:05,I'm here because I have a problem with 16-year-old girls being murdered.
300,00:18:09,00:18:12,DEBBIE: Look what I made with the Helping Homes Project.
301,00:18:13,00:18:15,"Not bad, right?"
302,00:18:15,00:18:19,"You didn't think I could do it, but this is, like, the third one of these houses I've built."
303,00:18:19,00:18:21,It's a lot of fun being a Helping Homes volunteer.
304,00:18:21,00:18:25,"I guess if I flunk out of school, I could always become a construction worker."
305,00:18:25,00:18:26,"(laughs, computer beeps)"
306,00:18:29,00:18:30,What're you doing?
307,00:18:30,00:18:31,I'm torturing myself.
308,00:18:31,00:18:37,"I'm going through the victim's computer, looking at her e-mails and her Friend Agenda page."
309,00:18:37,00:18:44,I'm just trying to figure out how does a girl like her end up in a brothel and then dead in a car on the side of the road?
310,00:18:44,00:18:48,Everything about her is so positive and wholesome.
311,00:18:52,00:18:55,"You know, Detective Crawford is about to bring the brothel owner in."
312,00:18:55,00:18:57,Maybe you want to be there.
313,00:18:57,00:18:58,Okay.
314,00:19:01,00:19:04,(door opens)
315,00:19:04,00:19:07,"Mm, brought a woman with you, huh, Detective?"
316,00:19:07,00:19:11,Is that so us gals can... relate?
317,00:19:11,00:19:13,"Oh, I doubt we have much in common."
318,00:19:13,00:19:15,Sex business make you uncomfortable?
319,00:19:15,00:19:19,"No, trafficking in young girls does do something bad to my stomach."
320,00:19:19,00:19:21,(chuckles)
321,00:19:21,00:19:23,What kind of person do you think I am?
322,00:19:23,00:19:26,CRAWFORD: We have DNA proof that Debbie Logan was in your brothel.
323,00:19:26,00:19:29,"Then she turns up dead, having been sexually assaulted."
324,00:19:29,00:19:31,You want us to believe there's no connection?
325,00:19:31,00:19:33,I run a legal business.
326,00:19:33,00:19:35,"Yes, you do run a business."
327,00:19:35,00:19:36,"You like to make money, right?"
328,00:19:37,00:19:48,"So let's say a client comes in and offers you a whole lot of money, but he likes them young, and you're someone who always delivers, so you deliver Debbie Logan."
329,00:19:48,00:19:51,CRAWFORD: We already have enough to shut you down.
330,00:19:51,00:19:55,"If you know who killed that girl, it's a good time to talk."
331,00:19:55,00:19:58,Unless you want us to hang a murder charge on you as well.
332,00:20:01,00:20:04,I don't know who killed her.
333,00:20:04,00:20:08,She was dead the first time I laid eyes on her.
334,00:20:08,00:20:10,"My bartender, Rex, he found her."
335,00:20:10,00:20:12,"Suzanne, there's a girl outside."
336,00:20:12,00:20:14,I think she's dead. What? Where?
337,00:20:14,00:20:18,She was outside in the parking lot.
338,00:20:20,00:20:23,I don't know anything about her being inside the brothel.
339,00:20:23,00:20:26,That is the one and only time I saw her.
340,00:20:33,00:20:36,"So, um, this is the spot."
341,00:20:36,00:20:37,She was right here next to her car.
342,00:20:37,00:20:42,I-I didn't see her until after I threw the trash in the Dumpster and was headed back inside.
343,00:20:42,00:20:45,"Why didn't you call it in, man?"
344,00:20:45,00:20:46,What the hell is wrong with you?
345,00:20:46,00:20:48,I went and told Madam Suzanne.
346,00:20:48,00:20:50,I thought she'd call it in. But she didn't.
347,00:20:50,00:20:54,"No, she told me to get rid of the body, just get it anywhere away from here."
348,00:20:54,00:20:57,So that's what I did.
349,00:20:57,00:21:00,I found her keys in her purse and I put her in the car.
350,00:21:00,00:21:10,"I did what I could to cover up the blood, so no one would know, and then I got her the hell out of here, away from the brothel."
351,00:21:10,00:21:14,"I drove her up the highway, parked the car and... and hitched back."
352,00:21:20,00:21:22,You're an idiot.
353,00:21:22,00:21:23,You know that?
354,00:21:23,00:21:25,"Come on, I..."
355,00:21:25,00:21:26,I didn't try to hide her.
356,00:21:26,00:21:29,I... I put her where I knew she'd be found.
357,00:21:31,00:21:34,(sirens wailing)
358,00:21:50,00:21:53,"HODGES: Blood, yours."
359,00:21:53,00:21:54,"Cigarette butt, mine."
360,00:21:56,00:21:57,Oh.
361,00:21:59,00:22:02,A 1926 penny.
362,00:22:02,00:22:04,That's got to be worth something by now.
363,00:22:04,00:22:07,I'm sure it's probably doubled or even tripled in value since then.
364,00:22:09,00:22:14,"Hey, you know, there's a rumor going around the office that you visited a brothel once."
365,00:22:14,00:22:15,Is that true?
366,00:22:15,00:22:17,"Many, many years ago."
367,00:22:17,00:22:20,"It's a long story, and not one with a happy ending."
368,00:22:22,00:22:24,No pun intended.
369,00:22:24,00:22:25,Aha.
370,00:22:25,00:22:32,"I will see your two cigarette butts, rusty pull tab and penny, and raise you one piece of turquoise."
371,00:22:32,00:22:34,Don't say I never gave you anything.
372,00:22:36,00:22:38,So I talked to the girls.
373,00:22:38,00:22:46,"Several of them said that the bartender was only outside for a minute-- long enough to dump out the trash-- then he came running back in, looking for Madam Suzanne."
374,00:22:46,00:22:48,"So if we believe the girls, Rex isn't the killer."
375,00:22:49,00:22:52,"Well, we still need to find the murder weapon."
376,00:23:01,00:23:02,"STOKES: Hey, check this out."
377,00:23:04,00:23:05,Shoe impression.
378,00:23:05,00:23:06,Looks fairly fresh.
379,00:23:06,00:23:09,"Pointed, like the toe of a boot."
380,00:23:09,00:23:11,Or a high-heel. Plenty of those in there.
381,00:23:14,00:23:15,Ah.
382,00:23:17,00:23:19,Or...
383,00:23:19,00:23:22,the killer left it behind when they were getting rid of this.
384,00:23:22,00:23:24,Consistent with the victim's head wound.
385,00:23:48,00:23:53,Only thing harder than getting blood from a stone is getting fingerprints.
386,00:23:53,00:23:54,Nothing there?
387,00:23:54,00:23:55,Nothing usable.
388,00:23:55,00:23:56,Too smudged.
389,00:23:56,00:23:59,Killer probably was wearing gloves.
390,00:23:59,00:24:02,You still running the prints from the brothel?
391,00:24:02,00:24:05,Yep. I already processed about a hundred lifts.
392,00:24:05,00:24:08,Probably have at least that many still to go.
393,00:24:08,00:24:10,Brothel turns out to be quite the popular place.
394,00:24:10,00:24:11,What a surprise.
395,00:24:11,00:24:12,"Interesting clientele, too."
396,00:24:12,00:24:18,"I've already had two city councilmen, a former child actor and an over-the-hill rock star."
397,00:24:18,00:24:20,(computer beeping)
398,00:24:20,00:24:29,"That's interesting. One of the prints from the brothel, the Western Room-- it's a match to one of the exemplar prints we collected before processing the victim's car."
399,00:24:29,00:24:30,You got a name?
400,00:24:30,00:24:32,Let's see.
401,00:24:36,00:24:37,That's the girl's father.
402,00:24:37,00:24:40,His prints are all over the brothel.
403,00:24:40,00:24:41,He was there.
404,00:24:44,00:24:51,RUSSELL: It's almost a clich√© at this point-- a revered man of the cloth indulging in carnal escapades.
405,00:24:51,00:24:52,"I checked with your secretary, Mr. Logan."
406,00:24:52,00:24:56,"You clear your schedule for ""personal reasons"" every Tuesday night."
407,00:24:56,00:25:01,"Right about the same time, your bank records show you withdrawing $500 cash-- week in and week out."
408,00:25:01,00:25:03,"Kind of brothel regular, aren't you?"
409,00:25:03,00:25:05,There's nothing illegal about my going there.
410,00:25:05,00:25:07,"A bit hypocritical though, don't you think?"
411,00:25:07,00:25:08,What happens there is between me and God.
412,00:25:11,00:25:13,"You're missing the point, Mr. Logan."
413,00:25:13,00:25:16,We don't really care what goes on between you and God.
414,00:25:16,00:25:19,"Or you and your favorite hooker, for that matter."
415,00:25:19,00:25:25,Our problem is: you frequent the very same brothel where your daughter was killed two nights ago.
416,00:25:25,00:25:27,That's our problem.
417,00:25:27,00:25:29,Wait a minute.
418,00:25:29,00:25:31,Debbie was at the brothel?
419,00:25:31,00:25:32,CRAWFORD: Don't act surprised.
420,00:25:32,00:25:33,We don't buy it.
421,00:25:33,00:25:36,You can't think I had something to do with Debbie's death?
422,00:25:36,00:25:37,"No, I'll tell you what I think."
423,00:25:37,00:25:41,I think Debbie figured out what your Tuesday nights are all about.
424,00:25:41,00:25:44,She caught you in the act.
425,00:25:44,00:25:45,"Daddy, how could you?"
426,00:25:45,00:25:47,We have to talk.
427,00:25:47,00:25:49,You are a hypocrite! Listen to me!
428,00:25:49,00:25:50,Everything you are is a lie!
429,00:25:50,00:25:52,This has to only be our secret!
430,00:25:52,00:25:53,"No, no, listen to me!"
431,00:25:53,00:25:56,(grunts)
432,00:25:56,00:25:58,Fight started in the Western Room.
433,00:25:58,00:25:59,That's where Debbie cut her knee.
434,00:25:59,00:26:01,"At some point, she ran outside."
435,00:26:01,00:26:03,I'm guessing you followed her out there 'cause you knew you had to stop her.
436,00:26:05,00:26:08,"Debbie, if you tell, I'll lose the church."
437,00:26:08,00:26:09,I'll lose everything.
438,00:26:09,00:26:12,And your mother-- you really want to hurt her like that?!
439,00:26:12,00:26:14,Don't even talk to me! You should've thought of that.
440,00:26:14,00:26:16,Don't you walk away from me!
441,00:26:20,00:26:24,I don't know what sick twisted world you live in.
442,00:26:24,00:26:27,"But I could never, ever, lay a hand on my daughter."
443,00:26:30,00:26:31,You don't have to take my word for it.
444,00:26:31,00:26:33,I wasn't at the brothel Tuesday night.
445,00:26:33,00:26:35,There was an emergency.
446,00:26:35,00:26:40,"One of my parishioners died, and I was ministering to that family all night."
447,00:26:40,00:26:41,This is their number.
448,00:26:41,00:26:43,You call and check if you don't believe me.
449,00:26:51,00:26:55,"Okay, so we're only testing shoes and boots with pointed toes."
450,00:26:55,00:26:58,"Okay, so sneakers, anything with a round toe, we don't need."
451,00:26:58,00:27:00,This is such a waste of time.
452,00:27:00,00:27:03,Can't Prince Charming here just test the shoes on his own?
453,00:27:03,00:27:04,Why do we have to be here?
454,00:27:04,00:27:09,Because the impression will be different with the weight of your foot inside of the shoe pressing down.
455,00:27:09,00:27:11,Okay.
456,00:27:13,00:27:15,Uh...
457,00:27:16,00:27:19,"Actually, I only need the right one."
458,00:27:23,00:27:24,You can have a seat.
459,00:27:30,00:27:31,"Okay, stand up."
460,00:27:32,00:27:34,Try to stand still.
461,00:27:34,00:27:36,"All right, now lift up."
462,00:27:36,00:27:39,Great. Take your shoes off and just leave them right there.
463,00:28:01,00:28:02,"Hey, Finn."
464,00:28:02,00:28:04,Yeah?
465,00:28:04,00:28:06,Take a look at this.
466,00:28:06,00:28:08,There's glass stuck in the sole.
467,00:28:08,00:28:11,That looks a lot like the glass we found in the victim's knee.
468,00:28:11,00:28:17,"You know, when I interviewed the girls earlier, Kirsten said that she had never been in the Western Room."
469,00:28:20,00:28:22,You lied to me.
470,00:28:22,00:28:25,You told me that you had never been in the Western Room.
471,00:28:25,00:28:26,"That's not true, is it?"
472,00:28:26,00:28:28,"Wow, a hooker who can't be trusted."
473,00:28:28,00:28:30,"Shocking, right?"
474,00:28:30,00:28:31,I don't think this is something to joke about.
475,00:28:31,00:28:33,Who's joking?
476,00:28:33,00:28:35,I know about your two drug busts.
477,00:28:35,00:28:40,It'd be really easy for me to make a call right now and have your prostitution license revoked.
478,00:28:40,00:28:42,Unless you have some other job skills that I don't know about...
479,00:28:42,00:28:43,"Fine, all right?"
480,00:28:43,00:28:46,I saw her.
481,00:28:46,00:28:48,"She showed up at the back door, and I let her in."
482,00:28:48,00:28:51,I put her in the Western Room so that Madam Suzanne wouldn't see her.
483,00:28:51,00:28:54,She'd blow a boob if she saw a kid in this place.
484,00:28:54,00:28:55,Why was she here?
485,00:28:55,00:28:57,I don't know.
486,00:28:57,00:28:58,We get girls like her sometimes.
487,00:28:58,00:29:00,Runaways usually.
488,00:29:00,00:29:04,They think the glamorous life of prostitution is gonna be the answer.
489,00:29:04,00:29:05,"Well, she wasn't a runaway."
490,00:29:05,00:29:07,Whatever.
491,00:29:07,00:29:09,Told her she didn't belong here.
492,00:29:09,00:29:13,"And when she broke that bottle, I showed her to the door."
493,00:29:13,00:29:15,That was the last time I saw her.
494,00:29:15,00:29:17,"Wow, that's the lamest lie I've ever heard."
495,00:29:20,00:29:23,Do you know that girl was only 16 years old?
496,00:29:26,00:29:32,"Someone raped and assaulted her, and then beat her over the head with a rock."
497,00:29:32,00:29:37,"So, I don't know what your life was like or what was done to you, but nobody deserves to have that happen to them."
498,00:29:37,00:29:39,(door opens)
499,00:29:39,00:29:42,LOGAN: Kirsten!
500,00:29:42,00:29:44,Don't say another word.
501,00:29:44,00:29:45,FINLAY: What are you doing here?
502,00:29:45,00:29:46,I called an attorney.
503,00:29:46,00:29:47,She doesn't have to talk to you.
504,00:29:54,00:29:55,I guess we're done here.
505,00:29:58,00:29:59,Kirsten.
506,00:30:03,00:30:04,Saved her from a confession.
507,00:30:04,00:30:09,"Not even a ""thank you."" You ever wonder why you even bother?"
508,00:30:09,00:30:11,"I mean, are you gonna pay for her attorney, too?"
509,00:30:11,00:30:13,If I have to.
510,00:30:13,00:30:15,Why would you do that?
511,00:30:15,00:30:17,"Well, because he's in love with her."
512,00:30:17,00:30:19,"She's Miss Tuesday Night, isn't she?"
513,00:30:22,00:30:24,She's my daughter.
514,00:30:26,00:30:29,But we thought that Debbie was an only child.
515,00:30:29,00:30:31,No. She had a sister.
516,00:30:31,00:30:33,Kirsten was 17 when she ran away.
517,00:30:33,00:30:35,We've been estranged ever since.
518,00:30:35,00:30:38,So you coming here every Tuesday night...
519,00:30:38,00:30:40,It's the only chance I get to talk to her.
520,00:30:40,00:30:42,"I have to pay for her time, just like anyone else."
521,00:30:42,00:30:44,At $500 a week?
522,00:30:44,00:30:49,$500 is nothing for the chance to sit down and talk to my daughter.
523,00:30:49,00:30:53,I have never given up on her.
524,00:30:53,00:30:56,And I'm never gonna give up on her.
525,00:30:56,00:31:03,"Mr. Logan, we have reason to believe that Kirsten may have been involved with Debbie's murder."
526,00:31:03,00:31:05,Then you better get the evidence.
527,00:31:05,00:31:09,'Cause I'm gonna make sure she has the best defense available.
528,00:31:12,00:31:14,"So our preacher has two daughters, right?"
529,00:31:14,00:31:18,"One a hooker, the other, as far as we can tell, practically an angel."
530,00:31:18,00:31:19,Okay? All right?
531,00:31:19,00:31:22,So let's say that Kirsten is our killer.
532,00:31:22,00:31:23,What's her motive?
533,00:31:23,00:31:24,"Jealously, right?"
534,00:31:24,00:31:26,Yeah.
535,00:31:26,00:31:33,"Kirsten's stuck being a hooker, paying the bills on her back, while her little sister is at home being treated like a princess."
536,00:31:33,00:31:35,Mom has written her off completely.
537,00:31:35,00:31:41,"Dad still pays a weekly visit, but he probably just preaches at her, tells her she should be more like her little sister, right?"
538,00:31:41,00:31:43,"Yeah, that could make her snap. Right."
539,00:31:43,00:31:45,Cracks a rock over Debbie's head.
540,00:31:45,00:31:47,"ANDREWS: Hey, D.B.?"
541,00:31:47,00:31:49,"Well, I've been working on an I.D."
542,00:31:49,00:31:51,for the guy who sexually assaulted our victim.
543,00:31:51,00:31:56,"I don't have a name yet, but I was processing DNA samples brought in from the brothel, and I found a match."
544,00:31:56,00:31:59,"Specifically, to DNA on bedsheets that came from the Asian Room."
545,00:31:59,00:32:02,So the last customer in the Asian Room...
546,00:32:02,00:32:03,Same person who raped Debbie Logan.
547,00:32:09,00:32:14,So I met this bozo at the brothel; he's a friend of the madam's.
548,00:32:14,00:32:15,(people chattering urgently)
549,00:32:15,00:32:17,MAN: Close the door! Close the door!
550,00:32:17,00:32:19,Run! Call the cops!
551,00:32:19,00:32:21,WOMAN: Help!
552,00:32:21,00:32:22,Somebody call 911! He's got a gun!
553,00:32:22,00:32:23,Who's got a gun? Ridley?
554,00:32:23,00:32:24,"No, no. The reverend."
555,00:32:24,00:32:26,He's gonna kill him!
556,00:32:26,00:32:27,MAN: Move! Let's go! Everybody clear out!
557,00:32:27,00:32:28,"Hurry up! Come on, you guys!"
558,00:32:28,00:32:29,LOGAN: Bastard.
559,00:32:29,00:32:32,How could you do that to a little girl?
560,00:32:33,00:32:35,To my baby?!
561,00:32:35,00:32:37,"Mr. Logan, drop the gun."
562,00:32:37,00:32:38,He has to die.
563,00:32:41,00:32:44,I have to kill him for what he did to Debbie!
564,00:32:51,00:32:53,"Come on, now, Jim. You can't do this."
565,00:32:53,00:32:57,He raped and killed my little girl.
566,00:32:57,00:32:58,"For God's sake, I did nothing of the sort."
567,00:32:58,00:32:59,Stop lying!
568,00:32:59,00:33:01,"Look, there's the proof."
569,00:33:01,00:33:02,"She fought for her life. STOKES: Whoa, whoa, whoa."
570,00:33:02,00:33:04,"Listen to me, now."
571,00:33:04,00:33:06,"Now, you know this is wrong. How is this wrong?"
572,00:33:06,00:33:09,"He deserves it! CRAWFORD: No doubt he does, but let us deal with it, okay?"
573,00:33:09,00:33:11,Not you.
574,00:33:11,00:33:13,No... (cocks gun)
575,00:33:13,00:33:14,I have to do this.
576,00:33:14,00:33:17,Hey! Hey! Listen...
577,00:33:17,00:33:19,"Now, I can't quote any scripture..."
578,00:33:19,00:33:23,"yeah, I don't have any godly words for you..."
579,00:33:23,00:33:30,"but I do know this: If you shoot him, Detective Crawford, right behind you, is gonna pop you right in the back of the head."
580,00:33:30,00:33:33,"Man, nobody wants that."
581,00:33:33,00:33:34,So how about...
582,00:33:38,00:33:41,...I reach up and I take that gun from you...
583,00:33:42,00:33:43,(shudders)
584,00:33:46,00:33:47,All right?
585,00:33:51,00:33:52,Nice and easy.
586,00:33:58,00:34:00,Good man.
587,00:34:02,00:34:05,"For God's sake, you should've shot him."
588,00:34:05,00:34:06,"Shut up, fool."
589,00:34:06,00:34:09,(siren approaching)
590,00:34:09,00:34:11,Don't you even move.
591,00:34:12,00:34:15,He did those things I said.
592,00:34:15,00:34:16,He's the one responsible.
593,00:34:16,00:34:17,We know.
594,00:34:17,00:34:18,But how'd you find out?
595,00:34:18,00:34:19,Kirsten told me.
596,00:34:19,00:34:21,Debbie explained everything to her the other night.
597,00:34:21,00:34:23,Is that why Debbie went to the brothel?
598,00:34:23,00:34:24,She was looking for her sister?
599,00:34:24,00:34:26,"No, no, no, she was there to see me."
600,00:34:26,00:34:28,She thought I was there with Kirsten.
601,00:34:28,00:34:30,She was upset and she wanted to...
602,00:34:30,00:34:33,tell me what that piece of crap had done-- how he raped her.
603,00:34:35,00:34:37,"OFFICER: Excuse me. Out of the way, please."
604,00:34:37,00:34:38,You can put those away.
605,00:34:38,00:34:40,We're all Code Four here.
606,00:34:40,00:34:41,"It's okay, Jim."
607,00:34:41,00:34:45,"Give this man a set of bracelets, and walk him out to the car for me."
608,00:34:45,00:34:46,"But sit on him for a few minutes, okay?"
609,00:34:46,00:34:48,He's gonna be riding back with me.
610,00:34:52,00:34:55,"Boy, I hope you guys are smart enough to realize he's delusional."
611,00:34:55,00:34:58,"It must be, uh, just the grief or something."
612,00:34:58,00:35:00,I tell you what: we'll take a look at the evidence.
613,00:35:00,00:35:01,We'll draw our own conclusions.
614,00:35:01,00:35:04,"Eh, that's the ladies at the brothel-- they don't hold back."
615,00:35:04,00:35:06,Yeah. You know what I mean.
616,00:35:06,00:35:07,Sure.
617,00:35:07,00:35:09,Open up.
618,00:35:09,00:35:10,Pardon me?
619,00:35:10,00:35:12,Your mouth. Open it.
620,00:35:12,00:35:15,"(scoffs) CRAWFORD: You know what this is gonna reveal, right?"
621,00:35:15,00:35:17,That you raped a 16 year old.
622,00:35:17,00:35:18,Rape?!
623,00:35:18,00:35:19,There wasn't any rape!
624,00:35:19,00:35:23,"If anything happened, it was consensual."
625,00:35:23,00:35:24,"And, for the record, I thought she was 18."
626,00:35:24,00:35:27,You knew she wasn't.
627,00:35:27,00:35:28,That's why you killed her; to keep her quiet.
628,00:35:28,00:35:31,Come on! You guys are way off base here.
629,00:35:31,00:35:34,"For starters, let's not paint this girl like some kind of angel."
630,00:35:34,00:35:35,She wasn't no virgin.
631,00:35:35,00:35:37,You know that's a lie.
632,00:35:37,00:35:38,She got paid for it.
633,00:35:38,00:35:41,"If you don't believe me, why don't you go ask the woman who pimped her out?"
634,00:35:41,00:35:43,CRAWFORD: What are you talking about?
635,00:35:43,00:35:44,This Madam Suzanne?
636,00:35:44,00:35:47,Not Suzanne; I told you-- Suzanne's on the up and up.
637,00:35:47,00:35:49,"Okay, then who the hell are you talking about?"
638,00:35:53,00:35:56,Can somebody please tell me what I am doing here?
639,00:35:56,00:35:59,I'm supposed to be at a memorial service for my daughter right now.
640,00:35:59,00:36:01,This is... unconscionable.
641,00:36:01,00:36:04,"Mrs. Logan, we've been talking with a..."
642,00:36:04,00:36:08,an acquaintance of yours-- Brime County Supervisor Roger Ridley.
643,00:36:08,00:36:11,"He's downstairs in a holding cell, as a matter of fact."
644,00:36:11,00:36:21,"FINLAY: He signed a sworn statement saying that he paid you $1,200 and, in return, you arranged for him to have sex with your daughter Debbie."
645,00:36:21,00:36:23,That's disgusting.
646,00:36:23,00:36:25,That is a horrible thing to say!
647,00:36:25,00:36:26,"Why do you think he said it, then?"
648,00:36:26,00:36:28,I have no idea.
649,00:36:28,00:36:31,I... I-I don't know.
650,00:36:31,00:36:36,I... my husband and I were pretty vocal opposing Mr. Ridley's election last year.
651,00:36:36,00:36:39,I-I-I can only think that he's trying to get back at us somehow?
652,00:36:43,00:36:45,"I mean, you're not gonna take the word of a..."
653,00:36:45,00:36:47,"of a dirty, horny pedophile over..."
654,00:36:48,00:36:51,"...mine, a preacher's wife."
655,00:36:51,00:36:53,"Well, you weren't always a preacher's wife, were you?"
656,00:36:53,00:37:00,"These are LVPD arrest reports, one from 1989 and two from 1990."
657,00:37:00,00:37:04,Solicitation for prostitution.
658,00:37:08,00:37:10,Okay.
659,00:37:10,00:37:11,So what?
660,00:37:13,00:37:14,I was a prostitute.
661,00:37:14,00:37:15,It was a long time ago.
662,00:37:15,00:37:17,RUSSELL: You were young.
663,00:37:17,00:37:19,You were really young.
664,00:37:19,00:37:23,But then your husband came along and rescued you.
665,00:37:23,00:37:24,(mocking laughter)
666,00:37:24,00:37:28,"""Rescued me."" That's funny, actually."
667,00:37:28,00:37:32,You ever know one of those people-- someone who rescues lots of animals?
668,00:37:32,00:37:36,"Then you see them with their pets, later, and you realize they don't give a damn about the animals."
669,00:37:36,00:37:38,They just want the whole world to think they're someone special.
670,00:37:41,00:37:42,That's Jim.
671,00:37:42,00:37:48,"All his charity, all of his missionary work, the hours and hours he spends helping out his parishioners..."
672,00:37:48,00:37:51,So you don't think that was genuine.
673,00:37:51,00:37:52,He just wants everyone to think he's a great guy.
674,00:37:52,00:37:54,Gets off on the pats on his back.
675,00:37:54,00:37:57,"Well, he obviously helped you turn your life around."
676,00:37:59,00:38:01,You sound just like all the rest of them.
677,00:38:01,00:38:05,I should be so lucky to have him.
678,00:38:05,00:38:07,My life before Jim was just fine.
679,00:38:07,00:38:09,"Being a prostitute, you mean."
680,00:38:09,00:38:12,"Good enough for you, good enough for your daughters, right?"
681,00:38:12,00:38:17,FINLAY: How old was Kirsten when you first started pimping her out?
682,00:38:17,00:38:18,Fifteen?
683,00:38:18,00:38:19,"Yeah, how old was she?"
684,00:38:19,00:38:23,"When I was 15, I was working."
685,00:38:23,00:38:26,Mm-hmm. I guess Kirsten was too scared to run to her dad.
686,00:38:26,00:38:27,Kept her mouth shut.
687,00:38:27,00:38:29,Too bad Debbie couldn't do the same.
688,00:38:29,00:38:38,"After she was raped by Supervisor Ridley, she ran to the brothel to tell her father what had happened, and tell him what you had been doing."
689,00:38:38,00:38:40,"RUSSELL: Yeah, lucky for you, he wasn't there."
690,00:38:40,00:38:41,But you were.
691,00:38:41,00:38:43,You were waiting outside...
692,00:38:43,00:38:44,"Mom...? Oh, you bitch!"
693,00:38:44,00:38:45,You think you're better than Kirsten!
694,00:38:45,00:38:47,You think you're better than me!
695,00:38:53,00:38:55,This is all a lie.
696,00:38:55,00:38:56,You can't prove any of this.
697,00:38:56,00:38:58,"FINLAY: Oh, yes, we can."
698,00:38:58,00:39:08,"We have a pair of shoes that we found in the trash behind your house, with blood on them, and I am sure that, when we test them, they are going to match the shoe impression that you left at the murder scene."
699,00:39:08,00:39:12,"RUSSELL: Also found a turquoise stone, in the gravel, outside the brothel."
700,00:39:12,00:39:16,"Matches perfectly to a bracelet that you had in your dresser drawer, so..."
701,00:39:16,00:39:20,"yeah, yeah, we can prove this, Mrs. Logan."
702,00:39:28,00:39:30,They're not my girls; you know that.
703,00:39:33,00:39:36,They were adopted.
704,00:39:36,00:39:37,Jim's idea.
705,00:39:37,00:39:38,Two more rescues.
706,00:39:38,00:39:39,I never wanted 'em.
707,00:39:50,00:39:52,Mr. Logan...
708,00:39:52,00:39:54,your wife will remain in custody.
709,00:39:54,00:39:56,She's gonna be charged with murder.
710,00:39:56,00:39:57,I'm sorry.
711,00:39:57,00:39:59,So it's true?
712,00:39:59,00:40:01,She killed Debbie?
713,00:40:01,00:40:02,"Yes, sir."
714,00:40:02,00:40:05,And then...
715,00:40:05,00:40:06,"what Ridley said, too? She was selling the girls?"
716,00:40:09,00:40:13,"Kirsten, for years, until she ran away, yeah."
717,00:40:13,00:40:14,And she was just starting with Debbie.
718,00:40:14,00:40:18,"All this time, Kirsten... never told me."
719,00:40:18,00:40:19,Or maybe she tried and I didn't see it.
720,00:40:19,00:40:22,I don't know how I could've been so blind.
721,00:40:23,00:40:25,"It's, you know, it's..."
722,00:40:25,00:40:27,been overwhelming.
723,00:40:27,00:40:31,All these people in my parish are in need and-and...
724,00:40:34,00:40:36,...and I neglected the ones who needed me the most.
725,00:40:38,00:40:39,And now I've lost them.
726,00:40:44,00:40:46,Well... maybe not all of them.
727,00:40:48,00:40:50,You could still save your daughter.
728,00:41:04,00:41:07,I think she'll be saving me.
