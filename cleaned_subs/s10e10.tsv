0	00:00:20	00:00:21	Hey!
1	00:00:24	00:00:25	Mom, get down!
2	00:00:27	00:00:29	I got you covered!
3	00:00:44	00:00:47	Ow! You son of a bitch!
4	00:00:56	00:00:58	Looks like he took a John Wayne shot.
5	00:00:58	00:01:00	John Wayne shot?
6	00:01:00	00:01:07	Yeah, the Duke would take one to the shoulder in all his movies, then he'd just shake it off like it was a mosquito bite.
7	00:01:07	00:01:11	Well, this was more like a spaghetti Western.
8	00:01:11	00:01:14	Involving Italians, lots of blood.
9	00:01:14	00:01:16	By the way, the guy they wheeled out of here?
10	00:01:16	00:01:17	That's Hank Rinaldi.
11	00:01:17	00:01:19	He and his mother run the place.
12	00:01:19	00:01:21	A lot of cops like to hang out here.
13	00:01:21	00:01:24	Camera's up there. We'll get tape.
14	00:01:24	00:01:26	And this must be where Hank went down?
15	00:01:26	00:01:28	That's where we found him, curled around his Glock.
16	00:01:30	00:01:33	Guessing this is Mom?
17	00:01:34	00:01:36	Yeah, that's Dolores Rinaldi.
18	00:01:36	00:01:38	One tough mother.
19	00:01:39	00:01:40	Go ahead.
20	00:01:40	00:01:43	Multiple gun shot wounds.
21	00:01:43	00:01:45	.45 still gripped.
22	00:01:45	00:01:47	(camera shutter clicking) She went down fighting.
23	00:01:47	00:01:50	Shooting at him, I'm assuming.
24	00:01:52	00:01:56	Three gunshot wounds to the torso, one to the head.
25	00:02:02	00:02:05	Edward Smith, 40.
26	00:02:05	00:02:07	Local address.
27	00:02:10	00:02:13	He's got a fat wad of hundreds in here.
28	00:02:13	00:02:16	Must be at least five grand.
29	00:02:19	00:02:21	Drawer's stocked with cash.
30	00:02:21	00:02:23	There's lots of antiques here.
31	00:02:24	00:02:29	Lugers, Tokarevs, Old Colts.
32	00:02:29	00:02:31	Some good stuff here.
33	00:02:31	00:02:32	Doesn't look like robbery.
34	00:02:32	00:02:36	Maybe he was a customer, in here to make a big purchase.
35	00:02:39	00:02:42	I might've found part of his shopping list.
36	00:02:43	00:02:45	101 SW. Smith &amp; Wesson?
37	00:02:48	00:02:51	What about these rogue footprints?
38	00:02:51	00:02:52	With the blood here?
39	00:02:54	00:02:56	There must have been someone else here.
40	00:03:03	00:03:06	Look like a small men's size.
41	00:03:06	00:03:08	Nine? Sneakers.
42	00:03:11	00:03:18	If he walked through the blood pool, he had to have been standing right here.
43	00:03:18	00:03:22	Guy stands in the middle of a three-way shootout and strolls out alive?
44	00:03:31	00:03:33	Was he just lucky?
45	00:03:33	00:03:36	Or bulletproof?
46	00:04:25	00:04:26	Hey.
47	00:04:26	00:04:27	Hey. Catherine.
48	00:04:27	00:04:29	Thanks.
49	00:04:29	00:04:30	You're welcome.
50	00:04:32	00:04:34	Body's over here.
51	00:04:36	00:04:40	A couple of teenagers were cutting through the park and spotted her.
52	00:04:40	00:04:42	Thought she was sleeping.
53	00:04:42	00:04:44	Snug as a bug in a rug.
54	00:04:46	00:04:50	Well, there's a path of displaced gravel coming down the embankment.
55	00:04:50	00:04:52	High-speed body dump?
56	00:04:53	00:04:54	Well, if it is, then this quilt is awfully clean.
57	00:04:54	00:04:56	So, how'd it get here?
58	00:04:56	00:04:58	Covered up after the fact?
59	00:05:02	00:05:05	There's road rash under the blanket.
60	00:05:11	00:05:13	Suspect made no attempt to hide her.
61	00:05:13	00:05:16	Yet he made an effort to tuck her in.
62	00:05:16	00:05:18	It's oddly tender, huh?
63	00:05:18	00:05:21	For a body dump.
64	00:05:21	00:05:22	Act of remorse?
65	00:05:23	00:05:24	Maybe our killer has a conscience.
66	00:05:24	00:05:27	I was in the back room.
67	00:05:27	00:05:31	I heard them arguing, Ma and this guy.
68	00:05:31	00:05:33	It's the guy in the baseball cap, right?
69	00:05:33	00:05:35	No, no. Not him.
70	00:05:35	00:05:37	The other one.
71	00:05:37	00:05:40	The one in the red shirt.
72	00:05:48	00:05:50	I didn't get a good look at him.
73	00:05:50	00:05:53	I just started shooting.
74	00:05:53	00:05:55	No! Had to defend my mother.
75	00:05:55	00:05:57	Not that she's ever been a sissy.
76	00:05:57	00:06:01	And this customer, he starts unloading at the crazy guy, too.
77	00:06:02	00:06:08	So, this guy in a red shirt he takes out you, your mother and a customer?
78	00:06:08	00:06:10	One against three?
79	00:06:10	00:06:12	Sir, there were a lot of bullets flying.
80	00:06:12	00:06:15	I don't know who hit who.
81	00:07:19	00:07:21	Okay. Here go the lights.
82	00:07:23	00:07:26	The red lasers are customer Ed's shots.
83	00:07:27	00:07:30	These are Delores's shots.
84	00:07:31	00:07:33	And these are Hank's shots.
85	00:07:34	00:07:39	And according to Hank, the man in the red shirt was everyone's target.
86	00:07:39	00:07:43	Which is consistent with everyone's trajectories, assuming he was a moving target.
87	00:07:43	00:07:47	But where are Red Shirt's bullets?
88	00:07:47	00:07:50	Well, all of these shots are misses.
89	00:07:51	00:07:52	Maybe he fired and didn't miss.
90	00:07:56	00:07:59	Langston's out of Autopsy.
91	00:07:59	00:08:00	Ed's ammo killed Dolores.
92	00:08:00	00:08:04	A combination of Dolores' and Hank's ammo killed Ed.
93	00:08:04	00:08:09	And the surgeon pulled one of Ed's nine mils out of Hank's shoulder.
94	00:08:09	00:08:11	Well, that answers that question.
95	00:08:11	00:08:14	The man in the red shirt never fired.
96	00:08:14	00:08:17	So, all three shooters missed him and only hit each other?
97	00:08:17	00:08:22	Warrick and I worked a case once where two guys were shooting at each other in an elevator.
98	00:08:22	00:08:24	Zero out of 25 were hits.
99	00:08:24	00:08:27	But the math is off.
100	00:08:27	00:08:33	Customer Ed put four of his nine mils into Dolores, one into Hank, and ten into the back wall here.
101	00:08:33	00:08:34	That's 15 shots.
102	00:08:34	00:08:38	And we collected 16 nine mil cases.
103	00:08:39	00:08:40	So, we're missing a bullet.
104	00:08:40	00:08:43	All of Ed's shots missed in this direction.
105	00:08:43	00:08:48	And unless it's in Red Shirt, it's got to be in this back wall.
106	00:08:55	00:09:00	Got it. Straight through the wall and into the stock room.
107	00:09:12	00:09:15	Huh. Ed's nine mil.
108	00:09:16	00:09:21	All projectiles now accounted for, which means Red Shirt wasn't hit.
109	00:09:21	00:09:24	It's hard to believe.
110	00:09:25	00:09:28	Doesn't sound like gun oil.
111	00:09:28	00:09:30	This can top's been doctored.
112	00:09:37	00:09:39	At least ten grand here.
113	00:09:39	00:09:42	It's probably the Rinaldis' 401AK.
114	00:09:45	00:09:48	Full-auto sears.
115	00:09:48	00:09:54	You insert these into the lower receiver of a semi-auto rifle, and you've got yourself a fully automatic machine gun.
116	00:09:56	00:10:00	Which is why they're illegal, and fetch a mint on the black market.
117	00:10:00	00:10:03	Two excellent reasons for hiding them.
118	00:10:06	00:10:07	Ran her prints.
119	00:10:07	00:10:09	Still a Jane Doe.
120	00:10:09	00:10:11	Suffered multiple traumatic events before she died.
121	00:10:12	00:10:14	C.O.D. is no surprise.
122	00:10:14	00:10:17	Disarticulation of the atlantooccipital junction.
123	00:10:17	00:10:19	Consistent with her impact into the rock.
124	00:10:20	00:10:23	This, however, is the result of a separate incident.
125	00:10:23	00:10:25	Superficial bullet wound.
126	00:10:25	00:10:27	She was shot?
127	00:10:27	00:10:29	Sodium rhodizonate test was positive for lead.
128	00:10:29	00:10:33	The extent of the blood clotting indicates it was antemortem.
129	00:10:33	00:10:35	Shot at least an hour prior to death.
130	00:10:35	00:10:38	So, he shoots her but doesn't kill her.
131	00:10:38	00:10:41	Then dumps her out of a car an hour later, which does kill her.
132	00:10:41	00:10:44	Why didn't he just shoot her again?
133	00:10:44	00:10:47	Well, I saw the crime scene photos.
134	00:10:47	00:10:49	It's only luck of the draw that she hit that rock.
135	00:10:49	00:10:52	Not much logic to it.
136	00:10:52	00:10:59	Gun shop's camera was out of focus, only took intermittent still shots and was on an oscillating pattern.
137	00:10:59	00:11:02	It's hard to choreograph a less useful record of events.
138	00:11:02	00:11:08	However, there were two helpful frames before the camera was knocked out by a stray shot.
139	00:11:08	00:11:13	This one shows Ed Smith and Red Shirt walking into the store together.
140	00:11:13	00:11:15	You can't see Red Shirt's face.
141	00:11:16	00:11:18	But it does look like they're together.
142	00:11:18	00:11:20	All right. Now check this out.
143	00:11:21	00:11:24	Hank blasting away at Ed.
144	00:11:24	00:11:25	Red Shirt is in front of Mom.
145	00:11:25	00:11:27	Not even in Hank's line of fire.
146	00:11:27	00:11:30	He told Brass he was shooting at Red Shirt.
147	00:11:31	00:11:34	Red Shirt is clearly not Hank's target.
148	00:11:34	00:11:35	Which isn't the only thing Hank lied about.
149	00:11:36	00:11:39	He told Brass that Ed was just a random, well-armed customer.
150	00:11:39	00:11:41	Ed was another customer all right.
151	00:11:41	00:11:44	His prints were all over the cash with the full-auto sears.
152	00:11:44	00:11:47	Which explains the five grand we found in his wallet.
153	00:11:47	00:11:49	He was there to purchase more sears.
154	00:11:49	00:11:50	From Hank.
155	00:11:50	00:11:54	Whose prints were on both the cash and the sears.
156	00:11:54	00:11:55	So, Hank's about to make another big sale.
157	00:11:55	00:11:58	Why shoot such a good customer?
158	00:12:00	00:12:06	Get too greedy for the green stuff, you can get yourself hurt.
159	00:12:06	00:12:11	We know about your little side business there, Hank, selling the full-auto sears.
160	00:12:11	00:12:13	Which is a federal offense in itself.
161	00:12:13	00:12:17	You pile on the fact that you lied to the cops about killing Ed Smith...
162	00:12:17	00:12:19	He was robbing us!
163	00:12:19	00:12:24	I was... I was afraid if I told you, you'd take a closer look at him, find out about the sears.
164	00:12:26	00:12:28	Honestly, I was just defending our store.
165	00:12:28	00:12:34	I come out of the back, and Ed's got my ma at gunpoint.
166	00:12:34	00:12:35	And not just him. He brought some partner with him.
167	00:12:35	00:12:38	So I did what my mother taught me. Hey! (fires gun)
168	00:12:38	00:12:43	Guy kills your mom, you're okay saying he died trying to defend her?
169	00:12:43	00:12:45	Make him out to be a hero?
170	00:12:45	00:12:48	The truth wasn't going to bring her back.
171	00:12:49	00:12:51	And I didn't want to go to jail.
172	00:12:53	00:12:55	So, you caught him, right?
173	00:12:55	00:12:58	Ed's wing man, the guy in the red shirt.
174	00:12:58	00:12:59	You caught him, right?
175	00:12:59	00:13:00	That's how you learned all this?
176	00:13:00	00:13:02	Well, actually...
177	00:13:02	00:13:04	But we're getting close.
178	00:13:04	00:13:05	Oh, God.
179	00:13:05	00:13:07	What?
180	00:13:07	00:13:09	He's still out there?
181	00:13:09	00:13:14	You got to find him.
182	00:13:14	00:13:18	That guy, the way he was just standing there with those bullets flying all around?
183	00:13:18	00:13:20	He was not human.
184	00:13:25	00:13:27	He was like the Terminator.
185	00:13:28	00:13:30	A machine.
186	00:13:30	00:13:33	I've seen my share of crazies.
187	00:13:33	00:13:35	But this guy?
188	00:13:37	00:13:41	Wasn't his first time at the death dance.
189	00:13:41	00:13:46	As long as he's out there, I'm staying right here.
190	00:14:08	00:14:10	Hey.
191	00:14:11	00:14:13	Car was parked in a loading zone off Industrial.
192	00:14:13	00:14:16	The ticketing officer saw the blood and towed it in.
193	00:14:16	00:14:19	I'm hoping it's related to our body dump.
194	00:14:21	00:14:26	R.O. is a Carrie Warren of Noelle Lane, Las Vegas.
195	00:14:26	00:14:29	Is that an I.D. badge?
196	00:14:32	00:14:35	It's our Jane Doe from the ditch.
197	00:14:35	00:14:38	She was dumped from her own car.
198	00:14:38	00:14:42	Clearly, she wasn't driving.
199	00:14:44	00:14:45	So, uh...
200	00:14:45	00:14:47	what's going on with you and Vartann?
201	00:14:49	00:14:51	I am a trained observer, you know.
202	00:14:55	00:14:58	Okay. I see it's still in its, uh, early investigative stages.
203	00:14:58	00:15:00	No comment.
204	00:15:03	00:15:05	Huh.
205	00:15:05	00:15:08	Same pattern as the quilt she was wrapped in.
206	00:15:10	00:15:12	Key's still in the ignition.
207	00:15:15	00:15:16	Out of gas.
208	00:15:16	00:15:20	Explains why the killer left the murder mobile in plain sight.
209	00:15:23	00:15:25	Looks like we have her house keys.
210	00:15:35	00:15:37	LVPD!
211	00:15:37	00:15:39	Anybody home?
212	00:15:41	00:15:42	How's it look?
213	00:15:44	00:15:47	No sign of forced entry.
214	00:15:47	00:15:49	All Carrie Warren.
215	00:15:51	00:15:53	Looks like she lived alone.
216	00:15:53	00:15:55	I got a blood trail.
217	00:15:55	00:15:58	It's all clear.
218	00:15:58	00:16:00	You're not going to like what you find in the bedroom.
219	00:16:01	00:16:03	I'm going to check the perimeter.
220	00:16:07	00:16:09	Blood spatter on the wall.
221	00:16:09	00:16:11	This is where she was shot.
222	00:16:12	00:16:15	Sheets match the quilt she was wrapped in.
223	00:16:22	00:16:26	There's no photos of any humans.
224	00:16:26	00:16:28	But she sure had some love for this German Shepard.
225	00:16:28	00:16:30	Yeah. Roscoe.
226	00:16:30	00:16:32	Oh, my God.
227	00:16:32	00:16:35	It's Roscoe.
228	00:16:46	00:16:48	He was shot.
229	00:16:48	00:16:51	Blood trail ends in the garage.
230	00:16:51	00:16:53	So, killer's in the bedroom.
231	00:16:55	00:16:56	Shoots the dog.
232	00:16:57	00:16:59	Shoots Carrie.
233	00:17:01	00:17:06	Takes Carrie and the quilt, and takes her car.
234	00:17:06	00:17:10	Control, this is 802 Charlie, Detective Vartann.
235	00:17:10	00:17:13	I need Animal Control to transport a dead dog.
236	00:17:13	00:17:14	Carrie's tidy.
237	00:17:14	00:17:19	Strange that she'd leave food trash in the bedroom.
238	00:17:19	00:17:21	Maybe the killer likes milk.
239	00:17:21	00:17:23	Stain on the bed skirt.
240	00:17:23	00:17:26	Milky vomit.
241	00:17:26	00:17:27	I'll get it to DNA.
242	00:17:27	00:17:29	Maybe we'll get lucky on some epithelials.
243	00:17:29	00:17:39	There's no pictures of any boyfriends, yet she's got a drawer full of tokens of someone's affections.
244	00:17:39	00:17:44	Hmm. She doesn't want to look at them anymore, but she can't bring herself to throw them away.
245	00:17:44	00:17:47	Maybe Roscoe wasn't the only man in her life.
246	00:17:51	00:17:53	Backed over by a car.
247	00:17:53	00:17:55	Fell down a well.
248	00:17:55	00:17:57	Attacked by coyotes.
249	00:17:57	00:17:59	Poisoned by a spider.
250	00:17:59	00:18:03	Lost in a cave.
251	00:18:03	00:18:07	Traded for a Mike Schmidt rookie baseball card.
252	00:18:07	00:18:10	And my favorite, given to a farm.
253	00:18:10	00:18:12	Allegedly.
254	00:18:12	00:18:15	The tragic fates of the Phillips family dogs.
255	00:18:15	00:18:17	Oh. Mm-hmm.
256	00:18:17	00:18:18	Okay.
257	00:18:18	00:18:20	I'm sorry.
258	00:18:20	00:18:23	I-I extracted a bullet from his dorsal lumbar.
259	00:18:23	00:18:25	Shallow penetration.
260	00:18:25	00:18:28	Lack of vital response in the surrounding tissue indicates he was shot postmortem.
261	00:18:28	00:18:31	Oh, accounts for the lack of blood at the scene.
262	00:18:31	00:18:33	No blood pressure, no bleeding.
263	00:18:33	00:18:34	C.O.D.?
264	00:18:34	00:18:35	Undetermined at this point.
265	00:18:35	00:18:38	Huh.
266	00:18:38	00:18:41	Medium caliber bullet flattened on two sides.
267	00:18:41	00:18:44	Double ricochet explains the shallow penetration.
268	00:18:44	00:18:49	And the fact that we have two wounds but just one bullet.
269	00:18:49	00:18:53	I bought my first Ruger 1022 from Rinaldi's.
270	00:18:53	00:18:55	Oh, sweet.
271	00:18:55	00:18:59	Colt Single Action Army. Beautiful.
272	00:18:59	00:19:01	Aw, this baby's a shooter, not a collector.
273	00:19:01	00:19:02	Dang it.
274	00:19:02	00:19:04	Hey, guys. I know you're slammed.
275	00:19:04	00:19:08	This is the round that we pulled from our female victim's German Shepherd.
276	00:19:08	00:19:10	You're looking for the Truth About Gats and Dogs?
277	00:19:12	00:19:14	A little bit of ballistics humor there for you.
278	00:19:14	00:19:18	See, 7.62 by 25 mil.
279	00:19:18	00:19:21	Only a few rare old makes of gun use this ammo.
280	00:19:21	00:19:24	Mauser, Tokarev, Norinco.
281	00:19:24	00:19:29	Hold on. We collected a Tokarev from the gun shop.
282	00:19:29	00:19:31	Here it is.
283	00:19:32	00:19:33	Whoa. Whoa.
284	00:19:33	00:19:36	The case was stuck in the chamber.
285	00:19:36	00:19:38	You were supposed to clear that at the scene, Greg.
286	00:19:38	00:19:41	I know, but I got it out of a shattered merchandise case.
287	00:19:41	00:19:44	Guns for sale are supposed to be unloaded by law.
288	00:19:48	00:19:50	It's clear.
289	00:19:50	00:19:53	Hey, y'all, there's a piece of somebody in here.
290	00:19:53	00:19:54	Must've blocked the slide with their hand.
291	00:19:57	00:20:03	Now, there is no way Rinaldi's would sell a gun with an expended case in the chamber and a hunk of skin in the slide.
292	00:20:03	00:20:05	Maybe it wasn't for sale.
293	00:20:05	00:20:06	Wait a sec.
294	00:20:06	00:20:15	If your vic was shot with that gun earlier today, and it wasn't for sale at Rinaldi's, then it stands to reason that your killer brought it there.
295	00:20:15	00:20:20	There were four players in the shootout, and only three known guns.
296	00:20:20	00:20:24	Maybe the Tokarev belongs to the Man In The Red Shirt.
297	00:20:24	00:20:26	Who's the Man In The Red Shirt?
298	00:20:26	00:20:27	Some guy on a crime spree.
299	00:20:27	00:20:29	Bobby, can you run the serial number?
300	00:20:29	00:20:31	Then we need to compare my bullet with your gun.
301	00:20:42	00:20:45	R.O. is a John Rakow.
302	00:20:45	00:20:46	Guy lives...
303	00:20:46	00:20:49	Right behind Carrie Warren.
304	00:21:04	00:21:08	Mr. Rakow, I see from your file you served in the military.
305	00:21:08	00:21:11	And you have a Tokarev automatic registered to you?
306	00:21:11	00:21:14	Yeah. I brought that back from 'Nam.
307	00:21:14	00:21:16	That gun saved my ass more than once.
308	00:21:16	00:21:18	Thank you for your service, Mr. Rakow.
309	00:21:18	00:21:19	You're welcome.
310	00:21:19	00:21:21	Where is the Tokarev now?
311	00:21:21	00:21:23	I gave it to a friend.
312	00:21:23	00:21:25	What's the friend's name?
313	00:21:25	00:21:27	It's a neighbor. Why?
314	00:21:27	00:21:28	Carrie Warren?
315	00:21:28	00:21:29	Yeah.
316	00:21:30	00:21:31	You guys get along?
317	00:21:31	00:21:36	Well, I ain't particularly crazy about that yappy mutt of hers, but we worked that out.
318	00:21:36	00:21:42	Mr. Rakow, do you make it a point to arm your entire neighborhood, or just the pretty girls?
319	00:21:42	00:21:45	I had a daughter once.
320	00:21:47	00:21:48	She was about the age of Carrie.
321	00:21:48	00:21:50	She moved to New York.
322	00:21:50	00:21:55	Young girl all alone in the big city.
323	00:21:55	00:22:00	I wish somebody had looked out after her.
324	00:22:00	00:22:03	So I look out after Carrie; I protect her.
325	00:22:03	00:22:05	Protect her from what?
326	00:22:05	00:22:08	This armpit of a city.
327	00:22:08	00:22:15	You know, when seconds count, you-- you cops are minutes away.
328	00:22:15	00:22:19	So you've got a crazy-ass boyfriend, got some screws loose.
329	00:22:19	00:22:22	She's always breaking up with him, and he's always begging to come back.
330	00:22:22	00:22:24	So how do you fit into all this?
331	00:22:24	00:22:31	I chased him off a couple times, but I couldn't watch her for 24-7, so I gave her the Tokarev and taught her how to use it.
332	00:22:33	00:22:36	Something happen to Carrie?
333	00:22:36	00:22:38	She's dead.
334	00:22:45	00:22:48	Someone shot her and her yappy mutt with your gun.
335	00:22:51	00:22:53	I'm done talking.
336	00:22:53	00:22:55	Okay, let's talk about something else, then.
337	00:22:55	00:22:57	What about the boyfriend?
338	00:22:57	00:22:58	Has he got a name?
339	00:22:58	00:23:00	Dirtbag.
340	00:23:00	00:23:05	And I can't recall his last name.
341	00:23:21	00:23:25	The man is wearing boots as big as all of Texas.
342	00:23:25	00:23:31	There's no way he could cram those dogs into size-nine sneakers.
343	00:23:31	00:23:34	Plus, I observed his hands; there's no slide bite.
344	00:23:34	00:23:35	He didn't shoot Carrie.
345	00:23:35	00:23:37	He wasn't in the gun shop.
346	00:23:37	00:23:39	He's not the man in the red shirt.
347	00:23:40	00:23:43	I got Roscoe's tox panel.
348	00:23:43	00:23:45	Your German Shepherd was poisoned.
349	00:23:45	00:23:49	High concentrations of lorazepam and diazepam in his blood.
350	00:23:49	00:23:53	Found the same anti-anxiety drugs in the milk you collected from the bedroom.
351	00:23:53	00:23:57	So, based on his stomach contents, Carrie's dog drank the poison milk.
352	00:23:57	00:23:58	What about Carrie's tox?
353	00:23:58	00:24:00	She was clean. Stomach was empty.
354	00:24:00	00:24:03	No milk. We didn't find any prescriptions at Carrie's house.
355	00:24:03	00:24:05	Red Shirt had to have brought the drugs with him.
356	00:24:05	00:24:09	So he dissolved them in milk and feeds them to the dog?
357	00:24:13	00:24:19	The dog apparently regurgitated some of the mixture onto the bedskirt, but not enough to save his life.
358	00:24:19	00:24:22	The killer premeditates the dog's murder, but not Carrie's?
359	00:24:22	00:24:24	Not necessarily.
360	00:24:24	00:24:26	He poisons the dog to shut it up.
361	00:24:26	00:24:29	Waits for her to come home, then shoots her with her own gun.
362	00:24:29	00:24:32	Well, if that's true, he knew her. He knew her dog.
363	00:24:32	00:24:34	He knew where she kept the gun.
364	00:24:34	00:24:36	No signs of forced entry.
365	00:24:36	00:24:38	He had to have a key.
366	00:24:38	00:24:41	Obvious question-- she have a boyfriend?
367	00:24:41	00:24:42	Oh, yeah.
368	00:24:42	00:24:45	And I'm betting he has a red shirt.
369	00:24:46	00:24:50	I mean, is this what women really want?
370	00:24:50	00:24:54	It's what men think women want.
371	00:24:54	00:24:56	Like candy.
372	00:24:56	00:25:01	It's sweet and hard to resist, but sooner or later, we just want some meat and potatoes.
373	00:25:01	00:25:04	All the women I take out just order a salad.
374	00:25:04	00:25:08	(laughs) God, I used to have drawers full of this crap from guys.
375	00:25:09	00:25:15	Now I just want a man I can count on.
376	00:25:15	00:25:20	My eternal love is yours in life and in death. Forever, Sam.
377	00:25:20	00:25:23	That sure sounds like a boyfriend.
378	00:25:23	00:25:27	Although I never wrote a love poem to a girl that included the word death.
379	00:25:29	00:25:30	There's something under that label.
380	00:25:41	00:25:46	Sam gift-lifted this book from a public library and gave it to his beloved.
381	00:25:46	00:25:48	Classy.
382	00:25:48	00:25:51	Call the library and find out who the last borrower was.
383	00:26:48	00:26:51	Las Vegas Police. Anybody home?
384	00:26:54	00:26:55	Go, go, go, go, go. Hold.
385	00:26:55	00:26:56	Who are you?
386	00:26:57	00:26:59	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
387	00:26:59	00:27:00	We're looking for Sam Trent. Who are you?
388	00:27:00	00:27:03	I'm Paul Trent, his father. He's not home.
389	00:27:04	00:27:06	What happened here, Mr. Trent?
390	00:27:06	00:27:09	It was an accident.
391	00:27:09	00:27:11	Any idea where Sam is?
392	00:27:11	00:27:14	My son's 27. I don't interfere with his personal life.
393	00:27:14	00:27:16	Well, we do. We have a warrant to search your house.
394	00:27:16	00:27:17	What's this about?
395	00:27:18	00:27:19	An overdue library book.
396	00:27:21	00:27:23	Mr. Trent, I need you to come with me.
397	00:27:29	00:27:32	Another accident. Mm-hmm.
398	00:27:42	00:27:44	Styron, Plath, Sexton.
399	00:27:44	00:27:46	Looks like a reading list from Morbid 101.
400	00:27:48	00:27:51	Taste in cinema appears to be much lighter.
401	00:27:51	00:27:54	These are all romantic comedies.
402	00:27:54	00:27:58	With the kind of guy who never gives up until he wins the heart of his dream girl?
403	00:27:58	00:28:01	Of course, Sam's dream girl is dead.
404	00:28:08	00:28:11	A photograph of Sam and Carrie.
405	00:28:11	00:28:13	Proves they were together. Mm-hmm.
406	00:28:13	00:28:17	Does this look like it was taken from the top of the Stratosphere to you?
407	00:28:17	00:28:20	No, it's not high enough.
408	00:28:20	00:28:22	It's got to be the Ivory Tower Skydeck.
409	00:28:23	00:28:27	It's kind of a dumpy old tourist trap with a nice view of the methadone clinic across the street.
410	00:28:27	00:28:29	I'll take you there sometime.
411	00:28:29	00:28:32	Gee, thanks.
412	00:28:33	00:28:35	I have...
413	00:28:35	00:28:43	at least a dozen ticket stubs to the Skydeck.
414	00:28:43	00:28:46	Maybe it was Sam and Carrie's favorite place.
415	00:28:46	00:28:48	Eight bucks a pop.
416	00:28:48	00:28:50	What do you have?
417	00:28:50	00:28:53	Letters.
418	00:28:53	00:28:58	Sam, meeting you up there, the city sprawling below us, changed my life.
419	00:28:58	00:29:00	This is five days later.
420	00:29:01	00:29:04	Sam, I'm sorry, but I can't be with you anymore.
421	00:29:04	00:29:06	And then a few days after that.
422	00:29:06	00:29:08	I can't stop thinking about you.
423	00:29:08	00:29:10	I need you.
424	00:29:10	00:29:12	You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
425	00:29:12	00:29:14	Sam, I hope we can always be friends.
426	00:29:14	00:29:17	Light-switch romance.
427	00:29:17	00:29:19	On and off.
428	00:29:19	00:29:21	Well, this is from last week.
429	00:29:21	00:29:23	You need to respect my boundaries, Sam.
430	00:29:23	00:29:27	It's over. Leave me alone, or my neighbor will kick your ass.
431	00:29:27	00:29:29	Good neighbor John Rakow?
432	00:29:35	00:29:38	Diazepam.
433	00:29:38	00:29:40	Lorazepam.
434	00:29:40	00:29:43	Both scripts written last week.
435	00:29:43	00:29:45	Both empty.
436	00:29:45	00:29:46	That's what killed Carrie's dog.
437	00:29:46	00:29:48	Mm.
438	00:29:49	00:29:54	Some other... letters here.
439	00:29:54	00:29:58	This one...
440	00:29:58	00:30:00	written two days ago.
441	00:30:00	00:30:01	From Sam to Carrie.
442	00:30:01	00:30:03	Looks like an early draft.
443	00:30:03	00:30:05	Carrie, we have talked about this.
444	00:30:05	00:30:09	I know talking is easier than going through with it.
445	00:30:09	00:30:12	But after the darkness comes the light.
446	00:30:12	00:30:18	In a painless moment we can be together forever.
447	00:30:18	00:30:23	That sounds like an invitation to a suicide pact.
448	00:30:23	00:30:26	She's dead.
449	00:30:26	00:30:29	Did he change his mind?
450	00:30:37	00:30:40	You have the results from the Carrie Warren scene? I do.
451	00:30:40	00:30:43	There was DNA on the lip of the tainted milk bottle.
452	00:30:43	00:30:47	And I just matched it to Sam Trent's toothbrush that was sent over from his house.
453	00:30:47	00:30:49	Sam drank the poisoned milk? Yeah.
454	00:30:49	00:30:53	Which is why I then ran the vomit, and it turns out it wasn't actually the dog's.
455	00:30:53	00:30:55	The mucosal cells were a match to Sam.
456	00:30:55	00:30:59	Sam tried to commit suicide in Carrie's bedroom but failed? Mm-hmm.
457	00:30:59	00:31:01	(sighs) What about the tissue from the gun?
458	00:31:01	00:31:04	(machine beeps) Just came up.
459	00:31:12	00:31:14	It's Carrie Warren.
460	00:31:14	00:31:16	You're joking.
461	00:31:17	00:31:20	She shot herself?
462	00:31:46	00:31:51	The physical evidence now supports the suicide pact theory.
463	00:31:51	00:31:55	Only Sam didn't die from the poison, and Carrie didn't die from the gunshot.
464	00:31:55	00:31:57	Okay, check this out.
465	00:31:57	00:31:59	This is Carrie's house.
466	00:31:59	00:32:01	This is where we found the body.
467	00:32:01	00:32:05	This is where you found her car.
468	00:32:05	00:32:06	And this is Rinaldi's Gun &amp; Ammo.
469	00:32:06	00:32:12	I think that Sam took the gun and Carrie, got in her car, and I think he was headed for the gun shop.
470	00:32:12	00:32:13	The gun was jammed.
471	00:32:13	00:32:18	It wasn't his gun, so maybe he thought it ran out of ammo.
472	00:32:18	00:32:21	He needed more bullets, so he could finish them both off.
473	00:32:21	00:32:25	Okay, so why did he dump her on the side of the road on the way to the gun shop?
474	00:32:25	00:32:31	Well, Carrie was dumped at the apex of a hairpin turn.
475	00:32:31	00:32:38	And a piece of the quilt was in the passenger door latch, which could have prevented the door from fully closing.
476	00:32:43	00:32:47	I mean, an accident would explain why he wrapped her in a quilt.
477	00:33:12	00:33:14	Nothing was going according to plan.
478	00:33:14	00:33:16	She's dead, he's not.
479	00:33:16	00:33:19	He's probably feeling left behind.
480	00:33:19	00:33:22	Yeah, and now he really needs to get to that gun shop.
481	00:33:22	00:33:25	So when the car runs out of gas, he just walks the rest of the way.
482	00:33:25	00:33:31	Suicidal guy enters a gun shop, desperate for another bullet to pop into his Tokarev.
483	00:33:31	00:33:35	If they're not going to give one to him, maybe they'll shoot one at him.
484	00:33:35	00:33:39	Mm. So somehow, Sam triggered the gunfight.
485	00:33:39	00:33:43	Just his luck, he's the only one that walks out of there unscathed.
486	00:33:54	00:33:56	Sara...
487	00:33:56	00:33:58	the closet door's been kicked in.
488	00:33:58	00:34:01	I don't think Sam did this.
489	00:34:01	00:34:05	Does that look like a cowboy boot to you?
490	00:34:05	00:34:07	Texas-sized.
491	00:34:07	00:34:14	Mr. Trent, if you want to try to help us save your son's life, you've got to tell me what happened in your house.
492	00:34:19	00:34:22	There was a knock at the door.
493	00:34:22	00:34:25	I barely heard it over the TV.
494	00:34:25	00:34:27	When I went to answer it...
495	00:34:33	00:34:36	Sam Trent, where is he? Where is he?! (gun cocks)
496	00:34:40	00:34:42	Sam, you son of a bitch!
497	00:34:44	00:34:47	When he didn't find Sam, he trashed the place and stormed out.
498	00:34:47	00:34:50	A couple minutes later, Sammy came home.
499	00:34:53	00:34:57	Sammy... Sammy, what happened?
500	00:34:57	00:34:59	Are you in trouble?
501	00:34:59	00:35:01	There was a man here.
502	00:35:01	00:35:02	I... I almost called the police.
503	00:35:02	00:35:04	No police, Dad.
504	00:35:04	00:35:06	Everything's gonna be fine.
505	00:35:06	00:35:09	Take my car. The guy had a gun.
506	00:35:09	00:35:12	Go on, t-take my keys, grab-grab my wallet.
507	00:35:12	00:35:14	Take what you need.
508	00:35:15	00:35:16	Thanks, Dad.
509	00:35:22	00:35:25	Sam only wanted eight dollars from his father?
510	00:35:25	00:35:28	The price of an Ivory Tower Skydeck ticket.
511	00:35:37	00:35:39	Hey, you-you can't park here.
512	00:35:46	00:35:48	I just received Carrie Warren's medical records.
513	00:35:48	00:35:58	She had a history of bipolar disorder for which she was recently was being treated at St. Anthony's Hospital, 101 Southwest Harmony Avenue.
514	00:35:58	00:36:00	101 S.W.
515	00:36:00	00:36:03	The shopping list from the gun shop. Yeah.
516	00:36:03	00:36:04	It was an address.
517	00:36:05	00:36:09	Uh-huh. We just assumed that he was driving Carrie to the gun shop.
518	00:36:09	00:36:11	This is her house...
519	00:36:11	00:36:13	body, car.
520	00:36:13	00:36:15	There's the gun shop.
521	00:36:15	00:36:17	And just to the west of it...
522	00:36:17	00:36:20	St. Anthony's.
523	00:36:20	00:36:23	He was headed for the hospital.
524	00:36:23	00:36:25	Sam was trying to save her life.
525	00:37:31	00:37:36	Control, officers are moving into position (cell phone rings) at the Ivory Tower.
526	00:37:36	00:37:39	I need a full rescue- team response.
527	00:37:39	00:37:40	Detective Vartann and a police officer are already up there.
528	00:37:41	00:37:42	You're free to go up.
529	00:37:42	00:37:44	I don't want any heroes up there.
530	00:37:44	00:37:46	Can you hear me, Catherine?
531	00:37:55	00:37:56	You son of a bitch!
532	00:37:56	00:37:58	You're a dead man, Sam Trent! (grunts)
533	00:37:58	00:38:01	One would think.
534	00:38:02	00:38:04	Police, drop the weapon! Drop it!
535	00:38:04	00:38:06	John, Sam didn't shoot Carrie.
536	00:38:06	00:38:11	You're lying! We found her skin in the Tokarev slide. John, you know what that means? I know you do.
537	00:38:11	00:38:12	Carrie shot herself. No, you're lying.
538	00:38:12	00:38:13	She wouldn't do that.
539	00:38:13	00:38:15	John, Carrie was bipolar.
540	00:38:15	00:38:17	She'd attempted suicide before.
541	00:38:17	00:38:21	You told me that Carrie needed protection, but it wasn't from Sam, it was from herself.
542	00:38:21	00:38:23	That's not true, John. I killed her.
543	00:38:23	00:38:24	You shut up!
544	00:38:24	00:38:26	I put the gun to her head.
545	00:38:26	00:38:28	Sam stop.
546	00:38:28	00:38:30	I brushed away her hair, I looked into her eyes...
547	00:38:30	00:38:31	and I just...
548	00:38:31	00:38:35	John, after Carrie shot herself, Sam took her to the hospital.
549	00:38:35	00:38:37	No, that's not true! I killed her, John.
550	00:38:37	00:38:41	We found a note with the address to St. Anthony's on it.
551	00:38:41	00:38:44	Sam, you loved Carrie.
552	00:38:44	00:38:47	You tried to save her.
553	00:38:55	00:38:56	Sam!
554	00:38:56	00:38:58	You don't have to die today!
555	00:38:58	00:39:00	This is meant to be.
556	00:39:00	00:39:01	You don't have to die today.
557	00:39:01	00:39:05	The last two people who tried to stop me ended up dead.
558	00:39:05	00:39:07	Just give me one bullet, okay?
559	00:39:07	00:39:09	Just one bullet. Whatever this takes!
560	00:39:10	00:39:12	Just give me one bullet! No...
561	00:39:12	00:39:14	(gunshots) Hey!
562	00:39:14	00:39:18	This is where Carrie and I met.
563	00:39:18	00:39:21	And this is where it's destined to end.
564	00:39:21	00:39:22	It doesn't have to end here.
565	00:39:22	00:39:24	We know about the pact.
566	00:39:25	00:39:27	We know you tried to save her.
567	00:39:27	00:39:31	And Carrie, she would want us to save you.
568	00:39:34	00:39:36	Okay, but I have one question.
569	00:39:36	00:39:39	Was it me or the dog?
570	00:39:39	00:39:42	What do you mean?
571	00:39:42	00:39:47	It wasn't, I mean, it wasn't technically a pact.
572	00:39:50	00:39:53	I wanted her to come home and find me.
573	00:39:53	00:39:58	My whole being rendered solemn valentine.
574	00:40:13	00:40:15	There was milk all over its snout.
575	00:40:26	00:40:28	Carrie loved that dog.
576	00:40:28	00:40:37	And when she came home and found him, was it the sight of me or the dog that made her pull the trigger?
577	00:40:37	00:40:39	It was you, Sam.
578	00:40:39	00:40:41	I'm sure it was you.
579	00:40:41	00:40:44	So nice of you to say that.
580	00:40:45	00:40:47	Sam!
581	00:41:21	00:41:23	Situation is Code Four.
582	00:41:23	00:41:24	One in custody.
