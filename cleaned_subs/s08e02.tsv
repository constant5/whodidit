0	00:00:29	00:00:31	Have a seat.
1	00:00:31	00:00:33	This is Grissom. How's the arm?
2	00:00:33	00:00:35	Please leave a detailed message after the tone. Fractured in two places.
3	00:00:35	00:00:37	(machine beeps) Gil, Conrad again.
4	00:00:37	00:00:39	Um... message number three.
5	00:00:39	00:00:41	Call me back please.
6	00:00:42	00:00:43	It's feeling better?
7	00:00:43	00:00:45	Yeah. Good.
8	00:00:45	00:00:47	(drums fingers on desk) So, you must know where he is.
9	00:00:48	00:00:49	Actually, I don't.
10	00:00:49	00:00:50	Really?
11	00:00:50	00:00:52	Okay, um...
12	00:00:52	00:00:54	Look, I don't want to play any games here.
13	00:00:54	00:00:58	This is as difficult for me as it is for you.
14	00:01:00	00:01:04	So let's just, uh, get this over with, shall we?
15	00:01:08	00:01:12	Okay then, uh, this is an administrative inquiry.
16	00:01:12	00:01:16	You and your supervisor were in direct violation of lab policy...
17	00:01:16	00:01:18	Are.
18	00:01:18	00:01:26	Are in direct violation of Lab policy which states that members of the same forensic team may not engage in a romantic relationship.
19	00:01:26	00:01:31	So when did you and Supervisor Grissom begin your relationship?
20	00:01:32	00:01:35	We've always had a relationship.
21	00:01:38	00:01:41	I mean when did you become intimate?
22	00:01:44	00:01:47	Two years ago.
23	00:01:47	00:01:50	I think it was a Sunday.
24	00:03:00	00:03:03	Sagebrush Valley High School.
25	00:03:03	00:03:05	The Cobras.
26	00:03:05	00:03:07	He looks like he could still be in high school.
27	00:03:07	00:03:12	Boy, football's gotten a lot more brutal since my playing days.
28	00:03:12	00:03:15	Yeah, where's the rest of him, still on the field?
29	00:03:15	00:03:19	There's no high school football fields around here anyway.
30	00:03:19	00:03:21	What do you think, Grissom?
31	00:03:22	00:03:27	Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.
32	00:04:16	00:04:19	Blood pool tells me the helmet must've been here for a while.
33	00:04:21	00:04:24	Vehicle tire rolled through it.
34	00:04:24	00:04:28	Helmet has black abrasions on it consistent with being hit by a tire.
35	00:04:28	00:04:30	Probably got pinballed down the road.
36	00:04:30	00:04:31	I checked with Traffic.
37	00:04:31	00:04:34	No reports of any traffic accidents near here.
38	00:04:34	00:04:38	Uh, Holstein's getting an absentee list from the high school.
39	00:04:39	00:04:42	Head's over there.
40	00:04:42	00:04:45	Blood trail leads up from here.
41	00:04:45	00:04:47	We follow the blood.
42	00:04:52	00:04:55	He say anything about what's happening with Sara?
43	00:04:56	00:04:58	No.
44	00:05:25	00:05:30	Hey, did Sara ever say anything to you about her and Grissom?
45	00:05:30	00:05:32	Not in so many words.
46	00:05:32	00:05:33	So you knew about the two of them?
47	00:05:33	00:05:36	Yeah.
48	00:06:07	00:06:09	Hey!
49	00:06:15	00:06:17	Where's the uniform?
50	00:06:19	00:06:21	If he's not a player, what's with the helmet?
51	00:06:21	00:06:23	Maybe he's a rabid fan.
52	00:06:23	00:06:26	There were all kinds of high school games last night.
53	00:06:26	00:06:27	Where's his hand?
54	00:06:27	00:06:29	Got to be around here somewhere.
55	00:06:38	00:06:41	The hand-- where did you find it?
56	00:06:41	00:06:44	20 yards away, two hours later.
57	00:06:46	00:06:48	David, he doesn't look prepped.
58	00:06:49	00:06:50	What's taking so long?
59	00:06:50	00:06:52	I can't get the helmet off.
60	00:06:52	00:06:56	I better get this ten-card to Mandy right away.
61	00:06:57	00:06:59	You hold the helmet.
62	00:06:59	00:07:00	Hold it.
63	00:07:04	00:07:07	His face looks like hamburger.
64	00:07:22	00:07:24	I found the same black powder on his clothes.
65	00:07:26	00:07:28	Hey, Mandy.
66	00:07:28	00:07:30	I got a ten-card on our John Doe.
67	00:07:30	00:07:34	Well, let's see if it matches the safe-kit that Holstein brought in.
68	00:07:34	00:07:38	Only have one more kid unaccounted for at that high school.
69	00:07:40	00:07:44	Hey, if you had a kid, would you collect a safe-kit on them?
70	00:07:45	00:07:47	Why not? It's better to be prepared.
71	00:07:47	00:07:50	Think of it as a cheap insurance policy.
72	00:07:50	00:07:53	It's just a print card, a cheek swab and a photo.
73	00:07:53	00:07:56	Then go to bed every night hoping you don't have to use it.
74	00:07:56	00:08:00	Mm... well, there's a match.
75	00:08:00	00:08:03	Your John Doe is Vincent Bartley.
76	00:08:03	00:08:04	Yeah?
77	00:08:04	00:08:06	Yeah.
78	00:08:06	00:08:08	Okay, good. Thanks.
79	00:08:08	00:08:10	You're welcome.
80	00:08:12	00:08:15	Well, nothing. I mean, it was dark.
81	00:08:15	00:08:16	It was really dark.
82	00:08:16	00:08:19	One minute we're married, and the next...
83	00:08:19	00:08:20	You know what? Good for you.
84	00:08:20	00:08:24	Divorces should be like Band-Aids, one quick yank and done.
85	00:08:25	00:08:26	You think?
86	00:08:26	00:08:29	Oh, what do I know?
87	00:08:29	00:08:32	Eddie and I stayed together way too long.
88	00:08:33	00:08:34	Every decision was an act of Congress.
89	00:08:44	00:08:47	It's the end of an era, ladies and gentlemen.
90	00:08:47	00:08:55	Hampton Huxley, publisher of Hux magazine-- where boys became men, and men became more manly-- has died.
91	00:08:55	00:08:58	That magazine got me through Vietnam.
92	00:08:58	00:09:00	Oh, that would explains the lookers out front.
93	00:09:00	00:09:02	They were Kitties.
94	00:09:02	00:09:04	Yes, Kitties, indeed.
95	00:09:04	00:09:06	He was dining with a couple of them when he bought the farm.
96	00:09:06	00:09:07	Miss Summer and Miss Winter, I believe.
97	00:09:07	00:09:14	Every male in the Phillips family gets a lifetime subscription to Hux for his Bar Mitzvah.
98	00:09:16	00:09:19	I guess my sons will have to settle for a Cross pen.
99	00:09:19	00:09:21	I'm sure the magazine will go on without him, Dave.
100	00:09:21	00:09:24	What are we looking at?
101	00:09:24	00:09:25	Puncture wound.
102	00:09:25	00:09:27	Um... no abrasion ring.
103	00:09:28	00:09:30	But I can reapproximate the skin.
104	00:09:30	00:09:32	So it's probably not a gunshot. Stabbing?
105	00:09:32	00:09:34	Maybe. Right through the temple, into the brain.
106	00:09:34	00:09:36	Be lights out in seconds.
107	00:09:36	00:09:37	It's a crowded restaurant.
108	00:09:37	00:09:39	Somebody must have seen something.
109	00:09:39	00:09:41	Not exactly.
110	00:09:41	00:09:42	Welcome to the latest fad.
111	00:09:42	00:09:44	Dining in the dark.
112	00:09:46	00:09:48	Waiters are blind.
113	00:09:48	00:09:50	No one sees anything.
114	00:09:50	00:09:53	Piece of cake, huh?
115	00:09:55	00:09:57	Did he just leave?
116	00:09:57	00:09:59	I think so.
117	00:09:59	00:10:01	Guys?
118	00:10:01	00:10:04	I have a dead body here.
119	00:10:13	00:10:19	Dining should be an experience, like opera or art.
120	00:10:21	00:10:24	It should feed the soul as well as the belly.
121	00:10:24	00:10:28	You should smell it, touch it and let it rest on your tongue.
122	00:10:30	00:10:33	I'm selling sensuality here.
123	00:10:33	00:10:35	I encourage eating with your hands.
124	00:10:37	00:10:40	Texture is crucial.
125	00:10:40	00:10:45	The salty, meaty flesh of lobster drenched in creamy, clarified French butter.
126	00:10:48	00:10:55	The pulpy seeded flesh and firm skin of a fresh fig dipped in honey.
127	00:11:00	00:11:16	The tongue understands four major taste groups-- salty, sweet, sour, bitter-- and has over 10,000 taste buds, each with a direct connection to the pleasure center of the brain, triggering endorphins.
128	00:11:16	00:11:22	The anticipation and the release of eating good food is chemically quite similar to getting high on drugs.
129	00:11:22	00:11:25	And apparently just as dangerous.
130	00:11:25	00:11:27	So tell me what happened.
131	00:11:28	00:11:29	I don't know.
132	00:11:29	00:11:32	Each one of the waiters has one of those clickers.
133	00:11:32	00:11:36	If there's an emergency, the houselights come up and a red light goes off in the kitchen.
134	00:11:36	00:11:38	Somebody help! (alarm buzzing)
135	00:11:38	00:11:41	(screaming) Help! Help him!
136	00:11:41	00:11:43	Hux!
137	00:11:43	00:11:44	Call 9-1-1.
138	00:11:44	00:11:46	Oh, so you didn't see anything?
139	00:11:46	00:11:48	I'm in the kitchen.
140	00:11:48	00:11:54	00 and 10 average 25 heads, ten courses per.
141	00:11:54	00:11:56	I have no time to pee.
142	00:11:56	00:11:59	April was here...
143	00:11:59	00:12:03	and Huxley was here.
144	00:12:09	00:12:12	Okay.
145	00:12:12	00:12:14	Got blood on the chair.
146	00:12:19	00:12:21	Blood on the tablecloth.
147	00:12:25	00:12:30	Blood drops on the floor, leading away from Hux's chair.
148	00:12:30	00:12:33	Stab him. Extract the weapon.
149	00:12:33	00:12:34	Drip, drip, drip.
150	00:12:34	00:12:37	And they end here.
151	00:12:37	00:12:40	Near Ms. Shasta.
152	00:12:40	00:12:45	Shasta McCloud-- big M, little c, big C, plus loud.
153	00:12:45	00:12:47	McCloud. (chuckles)
154	00:12:47	00:12:49	On TV, they never show anyone bleeding from a heart attack.
155	00:12:49	00:12:51	Is that what you think happened?
156	00:12:51	00:12:53	Well, yeah. I mean, all that Prevalis and diet soda.
157	00:12:53	00:12:54	I just figured...
158	00:12:54	00:12:56	April, shh!
159	00:12:56	00:12:59	He was an animal until the day he died, sir.
160	00:12:59	00:13:00	Uh-huh.
161	00:13:00	00:13:02	Wait a minute. What did happen?
162	00:13:02	00:13:04	Well-Well, you're the one with blood on you.
163	00:13:04	00:13:05	Maybe you can tell me.
164	00:13:05	00:13:08	I thought he just fell asleep like he always does at the end of meals.
165	00:13:08	00:13:11	Come on! Wake up, Huxey.
166	00:13:11	00:13:13	Wake up, Huxey.
167	00:13:13	00:13:15	Wake up, Huxey-Hux.
168	00:13:15	00:13:16	Come on, it's time to go.
169	00:13:17	00:13:18	Meow, meow!
170	00:13:18	00:13:19	Meow, meow!
171	00:13:27	00:13:28	Waiter!
172	00:13:28	00:13:30	Emergency! April? April, what's wrong?!
173	00:13:30	00:13:32	Call 9-1-1! Help! April! April!
174	00:13:32	00:13:33	Michael here.
175	00:13:33	00:13:34	Code red!
176	00:13:34	00:13:38	(screaming) Help! Help us!
177	00:13:38	00:13:42	Okay. Um, look, I'm going to need to take your sweater.
178	00:13:42	00:13:44	Yeah, like I haven't heard that one before.
179	00:13:44	00:13:47	(giggles) No. No, I don't mean right now.
180	00:13:48	00:13:50	No, I mean, I... I'll need to take it before I go.
181	00:13:50	00:13:53	You know, later, when I, when I leave, I have to take your sweater then.
182	00:14:01	00:14:02	Mr. Bartley?
183	00:14:05	00:14:08	Matt. I'm Vincent's brother.
184	00:14:08	00:14:10	I'm... Nick.
185	00:14:10	00:14:11	Stokes.
186	00:14:12	00:14:14	Uh...
187	00:14:14	00:14:16	You don't need to say it.
188	00:14:16	00:14:20	I knew when the detective asked me for that safe-kit that it was going to be Vinnie.
189	00:14:20	00:14:23	Shouldn't I be talking to your parents?
190	00:14:23	00:14:25	Don't have any parents.
191	00:14:25	00:14:30	Mom skipped out when we were little, and Dad died a couple years ago.
192	00:14:30	00:14:32	It's just the two of us.
193	00:14:33	00:14:35	Matt...
194	00:14:35	00:14:41	your brother wasn't on the football team, but when we found him, he was wearing a football helmet.
195	00:14:41	00:14:42	Why is that?
196	00:14:42	00:14:44	It was my old helmet.
197	00:14:44	00:14:46	Is that how you got injured?
198	00:14:46	00:14:48	No.
199	00:14:48	00:14:51	It was the last day of spring break, and...
200	00:14:51	00:14:53	I was wasted.
201	00:14:53	00:14:57	Like a dumb-ass, I dove into the Tangiers wave pool headfirst.
202	00:14:59	00:15:01	Fractured my T-1 vertebra.
203	00:15:01	00:15:03	So why the helmet?
204	00:15:03	00:15:06	Well, I was a pretty good football player.
205	00:15:08	00:15:11	He was proud of that.
206	00:15:11	00:15:14	That and my dad's dragon belt.
207	00:15:14	00:15:18	He got it when he was in the service.
208	00:15:18	00:15:20	Vinnie wears it every day.
209	00:15:20	00:15:24	It's just something that he has to hold onto...
210	00:15:24	00:15:25	(voice breaks) ...to deal with.
211	00:15:25	00:15:27	Yeah.
212	00:15:27	00:15:31	You know, one of these could've been the murder weapon.
213	00:15:31	00:15:32	It's approximate in size and shape.
214	00:15:32	00:15:35	And everybody had one.
215	00:15:45	00:15:48	Well, something dripped over here that is not blood.
216	00:15:48	00:15:51	Well, could've been whatever food was on the skewers.
217	00:15:51	00:15:55	ALS will pick up anything that's fatty or dairy-based.
218	00:16:11	00:16:14	Could you turn off the lights for a second?
219	00:16:22	00:16:27	I'm sorry, but this is a stupid idea for a restaurant.
220	00:16:27	00:16:29	I need to see what I'm eating.
221	00:16:32	00:16:35	I can see just fine.
222	00:16:35	00:16:36	Where are you?
223	00:16:36	00:16:38	Right here.
224	00:16:38	00:16:40	Oh.
225	00:16:44	00:16:46	Hi. Hello.
226	00:16:48	00:16:49	Night vision goggles?
227	00:16:49	00:16:52	Yeah, someone left these behind.
228	00:16:52	00:16:56	Kind of defeats the purpose of dining in the dark.
229	00:16:56	00:16:59	Unless you don't come here for the food.
230	00:17:01	00:17:03	Mr. Nivens.
231	00:17:03	00:17:07	Are these yours?
232	00:17:11	00:17:13	I'll take that as a yes.
233	00:17:16	00:17:18	Wait, wait... I didn't kill anyone.
234	00:17:18	00:17:22	Then why would your bring military-grade, night vision goggles to the restaurant?
235	00:17:22	00:17:23	A hunch.
236	00:17:27	00:17:29	Yeah.
237	00:17:29	00:17:34	Oh, that's so good. Tastes so good Sweetheart, you want to try some of my steak?
238	00:17:36	00:17:37	No, thanks.
239	00:17:37	00:17:40	I'm all good.
240	00:17:40	00:17:43	Yeah... (giggles)
241	00:17:45	00:17:47	Mmm...
242	00:17:51	00:17:55	Always be suspicious when your wife wants to dine in the dark with another couple.
243	00:17:58	00:18:01	You brought night vision goggles to spy on me during dinner?
244	00:18:01	00:18:03	Damn right.
245	00:18:09	00:18:12	Millions of tires wear out ever year.
246	00:18:12	00:18:14	You ever wonder where all that rubber dust goes?
247	00:18:14	00:18:16	No, I don't.
248	00:18:16	00:18:21	The black powder trace you found in your victim's clothing was tire rubber.
249	00:18:21	00:18:23	It's not surprising.
250	00:18:23	00:18:24	we found the body on the side of the highway.
251	00:18:24	00:18:26	Of course you would expect that.
252	00:18:26	00:18:29	However, I did find some very interesting type of rubber.
253	00:18:29	00:18:31	Okay, Hodges, dazzle me.
254	00:18:31	00:18:35	Truck tires have 27% isoprene and 14% neoprene.
255	00:18:35	00:18:36	That's what makes them so hard.
256	00:18:37	00:18:42	Passenger tires have a lower isoprene-to-neoprene ratio, but they also have silica for fuel economy and wet traction.
257	00:18:43	00:18:51	Go-cart tires, or slicks, to those in the know, have much higher levels of carbon black and oil, resulting in extremely high traction.
258	00:18:51	00:18:53	Guess I better get my go-cart on.
259	00:18:53	00:18:57	You know, just so you know, I'm a bit of go-cart enthusiast myself.
260	00:18:57	00:18:59	Oh, uh... that's awesome.
261	00:19:06	00:19:09	Have you seen this guy before?
262	00:19:09	00:19:11	Day before yesterday.
263	00:19:11	00:19:13	Day before that, and the day before that.
264	00:19:13	00:19:15	Oh, man, did he get in trouble?
265	00:19:15	00:19:17	Are these the race stats?
266	00:19:17	00:19:18	Uh-huh.
267	00:19:18	00:19:19	You keep record of them?
268	00:19:19	00:19:21	Yeah, all in here.
269	00:19:21	00:19:24	People ask for them every day like they're some sort of trophy.
270	00:19:24	00:19:28	Could you print out Vincent Bartley's trophy from the last time he was here?
271	00:19:28	00:19:31	Yeah. But I'm not getting him in trouble, am I?
272	00:19:31	00:19:33	No. No, not really.
273	00:19:33	00:19:38	You know, when I was a kid, we used to make these things out of lunch trays and old lawn mower engines.
274	00:19:38	00:19:42	When I was kid, I used to make bombs, and origami.
275	00:19:42	00:19:44	Oh.
276	00:19:44	00:19:46	Vinnie Vroom. Won all three of his races.
277	00:19:46	00:19:49	Beat out a guy named Hot Rod.
278	00:19:49	00:19:52	Vinnie ran circles around him.
279	00:20:14	00:20:15	Yes.
280	00:20:15	00:20:18	Yes. Yes, is that all you got?
281	00:20:18	00:20:19	Is that all you got?
282	00:20:19	00:20:20	Is that all you got? Is that all you got?
283	00:20:20	00:20:22	Is that all you got? Is that all you got?
284	00:20:22	00:20:26	Rodney went from being A-Rod to being No-Rod.
285	00:20:26	00:20:29	Hey, there he is, right there.
286	00:20:31	00:20:34	Aw, come on. Hey, if you guys want to race, then you guys have to wear dresses, huh?
287	00:20:34	00:20:35	Get your skill up, all right.
288	00:20:35	00:20:38	I need some competition here. Hot Rod!
289	00:21:02	00:21:03	Get out of the truck!
290	00:21:03	00:21:05	Get out of the truck now!
291	00:21:05	00:21:09	Get out of the truck now!
292	00:21:09	00:21:13	Nothing says I'm guilty like running from the cops, dumb-ass.
293	00:21:13	00:21:15	Give me his wallet.
294	00:21:18	00:21:20	Rodney Banks.
295	00:21:20	00:21:22	We're with the Vegas Crime Lab, Mr. Banks.
296	00:21:22	00:21:24	Hey, I didn't do nothing.
297	00:21:24	00:21:25	You got quite a mess here, Rod.
298	00:21:25	00:21:28	Mind if I take a look?
299	00:21:34	00:21:35	Where'd you get that belt?
300	00:21:35	00:21:36	I don't know.
301	00:21:36	00:21:38	Where? I don't know.
302	00:21:40	00:21:42	Blood.
303	00:21:42	00:21:45	Looks like things just got a lot hotter for you, Rod.
304	00:22:00	00:22:04	All skewers accounted for, none of them bloody.
305	00:22:04	00:22:13	We've got a high-profile dead guy in a locked-room situation, with 16 diners and three blind waiters.
306	00:22:13	00:22:15	Give me something.
307	00:22:15	00:22:18	How about a Band-Aid with petals?
308	00:22:27	00:22:30	It's not a Band-Aid.
309	00:22:30	00:22:32	It's a nipple flower.
310	00:22:32	00:22:34	What's it doing at a table with four guys?
311	00:22:34	00:22:36	Can I go to the bathroom?
312	00:22:36	00:22:38	Please, please, please?!
313	00:22:38	00:22:39	Again? Yes, sir.
314	00:22:39	00:22:40	Yeah, okay.
315	00:22:43	00:22:45	Okay.
316	00:22:45	00:22:46	What's so funny?
317	00:22:46	00:22:51	We slipped a laxative in his beer in the dark.
318	00:22:51	00:22:53	It's his sixth trip to the can.
319	00:22:53	00:22:55	It's freakin' hilarious.
320	00:22:55	00:22:57	What are you guys, like 12 years old?
321	00:22:57	00:22:59	Oh, hey, hey, Curly.
322	00:22:59	00:23:00	How come you're so pretty in pink?
323	00:23:00	00:23:02	Huh?
324	00:23:03	00:23:05	Breast exam.
325	00:23:06	00:23:11	You know, doctors without boundaries, if you know what I mean.
326	00:23:15	00:23:16	You guys, come here.
327	00:23:16	00:23:17	It's total darkness.
328	00:23:18	00:23:19	There's two Kitties.
329	00:23:19	00:23:21	That's four...
330	00:23:21	00:23:23	They're all up for grabs!
331	00:23:23	00:23:27	I'm going on a mission of mercy.
332	00:23:38	00:23:40	Who is that?
333	00:23:41	00:23:42	Hux?
334	00:23:42	00:23:44	Stop it.
335	00:23:44	00:23:45	Save it for later.
336	00:23:46	00:23:47	What are you talking about?
337	00:23:47	00:23:48	That's not you, Hux?
338	00:23:48	00:23:50	Somebody's touching me!
339	00:23:50	00:23:51	Sweet mother.
340	00:23:51	00:23:53	Guys, they're real-- both of them!
341	00:23:53	00:23:54	Waiter?
342	00:23:54	00:23:56	Waiter, we have a problem over here.
343	00:23:56	00:23:58	(laughing) Yeah, I lead Mr. Manducci back to his seat.
344	00:23:59	00:24:03	He and his brothers had had quite a bit to drink.
345	00:24:03	00:24:06	So it was the blind leading the drunk, huh?
346	00:24:06	00:24:08	I could do it with my eyes closed.
347	00:24:08	00:24:10	Well, did you, did you hear anything unusual?
348	00:24:10	00:24:13	No. Everyone seemed to be having a good time.
349	00:24:13	00:24:15	Until the woman in the fuzzy dress shrieked.
350	00:24:15	00:24:18	I found Mr. Huxley slumped forward.
351	00:24:18	00:24:22	Checked for a pulse, and he didn't have one, so I turned on the emergency lights.
352	00:24:22	00:24:25	Then she really screamed.
353	00:24:25	00:24:27	Is she pretty?
354	00:24:27	00:24:30	She had a pretty girl scream.
355	00:24:30	00:24:32	Oh, man.
356	00:24:32	00:24:33	She's a Huxley Kitty.
357	00:24:33	00:24:36	She's gorgeous.
358	00:24:38	00:24:42	Hey, uh...
359	00:24:43	00:24:44	Let me ask you something.
360	00:24:44	00:24:47	Did you wash your hands?
361	00:24:47	00:24:50	Force of habit; I'm sorry.
362	00:24:50	00:24:51	Waiter.
363	00:24:51	00:24:54	Okay, we're going to have to take your prints, okay?
364	00:24:54	00:24:55	Sure.
365	00:24:55	00:24:58	We're going to walk, straight ahead.
366	00:25:01	00:25:04	Looks like there was some kind of struggle.
367	00:25:05	00:25:08	Sticky.
368	00:25:11	00:25:14	What do you think it is?
369	00:25:17	00:25:19	Honey?
370	00:25:19	00:25:21	The detective needs to ask us some questions.
371	00:25:21	00:25:23	Hi, Nanci Katz.
372	00:25:23	00:25:24	Soon to be Ellis.
373	00:25:25	00:25:26	(giggles) I'm Jim Brass.
374	00:25:26	00:25:28	Yes. So, what happened, Nanci?
375	00:25:28	00:25:31	Oh, um... ask him.
376	00:25:31	00:25:34	Oh, uh, well, I-I thought it would be romantic...
377	00:25:34	00:25:36	Mmm.
378	00:25:36	00:25:39	I have not ever tasted a fig this juicy.
379	00:25:39	00:25:41	Oh, they're so good. Mmm.
380	00:25:41	00:25:43	It's like they're, it's like, it's better than the newtons.
381	00:25:43	00:25:45	Mmm. It's so much better.
382	00:25:45	00:25:47	Oh, God!
383	00:25:47	00:25:48	Baby, are you okay?
384	00:25:48	00:25:50	Yeah, um... What happened?
385	00:25:50	00:25:53	Yeah. Uh... a thing...
386	00:25:53	00:25:54	I'm, uh, okay. It's Michael here.
387	00:25:54	00:25:57	Is... is everyone all right?
388	00:25:57	00:25:59	Oh, uh, yeah.
389	00:25:59	00:26:00	Michael, I'm just...
390	00:26:00	00:26:02	I'm trying to get something going here.
391	00:26:02	00:26:03	Oh, no problem, sir.
392	00:26:03	00:26:05	I'll leave you two alone. Okay.
393	00:26:05	00:26:07	Uh, baby, where's your...
394	00:26:07	00:26:08	Yeah? Where's your hand?
395	00:26:09	00:26:13	Ever since I met you, I've known I wanted to ask you this question. Yeah.
396	00:26:13	00:26:14	One, two, three.
397	00:26:14	00:26:16	Would you be my wife?
398	00:26:16	00:26:17	Will you marry me?
399	00:26:17	00:26:20	Yes. Yes.
400	00:26:20	00:26:21	Oh, my gosh.
401	00:26:21	00:26:23	I can't even see it, but it feels big.
402	00:26:23	00:26:25	The ring, I mean. Sure, yeah.
403	00:26:25	00:26:26	Yes! Yes!
404	00:26:26	00:26:29	Oh.
405	00:26:30	00:26:31	Congratulations.
406	00:26:31	00:26:32	So how'd you bump your noggin?
407	00:26:35	00:26:37	It was dark; nobody, could see.
408	00:26:37	00:26:39	I wanted to say yes.
409	00:26:40	00:26:41	Loud and clear.
410	00:26:42	00:26:45	There's a lot of metal under those tables.
411	00:26:45	00:26:46	There really is, yeah.
412	00:26:46	00:26:48	Way too much. It's not safe.
413	00:26:48	00:26:49	I bet.
414	00:26:49	00:26:52	Losing the race was just the beginning.
415	00:26:57	00:27:01	Then, you killed him, cut his body up.
416	00:27:01	00:27:03	and dumped it on the side of the road.
417	00:27:03	00:27:04	Whoa, man.
418	00:27:04	00:27:07	I swear I didn't kill anybody.
419	00:27:08	00:27:10	Or I didn't cut anybody up or dump 'em.
420	00:27:11	00:27:14	All I did was ask him for a rematch...
421	00:27:14	00:27:17	off the track, where it really counts.
422	00:27:43	00:27:46	Yeah!
423	00:27:53	00:27:58	So your statement is he just spontaneously lost his head?
424	00:27:58	00:28:00	Yeah.
425	00:28:00	00:28:03	You know, one minute, he's staring at me.
426	00:28:03	00:28:06	The next, I look back, and the Headless Horseman is driving his cart.
427	00:28:06	00:28:08	And then what happened?
428	00:28:23	00:28:26	So why you just didn't ditch the carts?
429	00:28:27	00:28:33	Christin, that... that girl at the track, she let us sneak out with them.
430	00:28:34	00:28:39	You know, my life was turning into a horror movie-- I didn't want to bring her in on it.
431	00:28:47	00:28:49	You've been dodging me; it's time to talk.
432	00:28:49	00:28:57	Gil, nobody wants to hear about your love life less than I do, but since you didn't handle this right, I have to take a formal statement.
433	00:29:01	00:29:03	Should've been a conversation between friends.
434	00:29:03	00:29:05	I mean, we could've found some way around this.
435	00:29:05	00:29:08	Catherine could have done Sara's evaluations.
436	00:29:08	00:29:09	Why didn't you just tell me?
437	00:29:10	00:29:13	We didn't want you to know.
438	00:29:13	00:29:16	Don't most women like the world to know they're dating someone?
439	00:29:17	00:29:21	Where do you get your information about women, Conrad?
440	00:29:24	00:29:28	Okay, so, when did you two, you know?
441	00:29:32	00:29:34	Nine years ago.
442	00:29:35	00:29:37	You know what?
443	00:29:37	00:29:40	You two need to get your stories straight.
444	00:30:02	00:30:04	There's road gravel embedded in all these tires.
445	00:30:04	00:30:07	Yeah, but no visible blood on that one.
446	00:30:07	00:30:10	Got a worn area on this front bumper.
447	00:30:10	00:30:12	Some brown trace.
448	00:30:12	00:30:14	Same goes for the rear of that one.
449	00:30:18	00:30:27	Well, if it turns out to be leather, it would confirm Hot Rod's story that he towed the second cart back using Vinnie's belt. Got what looks like...
450	00:30:27	00:30:28	blood on this wheel well.
451	00:30:38	00:30:40	This is the victim's cart.
452	00:30:40	00:30:43	Must have been movin' when his head popped off.
453	00:30:45	00:30:49	Well, another one for the scrapbook.
454	00:30:49	00:30:50	Boy, he looks different without hair.
455	00:30:50	00:30:52	Never knew he wore a toupee.
456	00:30:52	00:30:57	Oh, uh, it had something sticky on it, so I bagged it for Trace.
457	00:30:57	00:30:59	But if you want, we could put it back on for the photo op.
458	00:30:59	00:31:01	No, that's okay; let's get to cutting.
459	00:31:18	00:31:29	Embedded horizontally in the parenchyma of the right temporal lobe is a linear, silver-toned, metal tube that tapers to a point.
460	00:31:29	00:31:34	And in this case, David, the pen may be mightier than the sword.
461	00:31:42	00:31:43	Okay.
462	00:31:44	00:31:45	Okay, that pen's not mine.
463	00:31:45	00:31:48	Yeah. Nice try, sweetheart.
464	00:31:50	00:31:52	Excuse me.
465	00:31:52	00:31:53	Can I be Lucy Logic for a bit?
466	00:31:53	00:31:55	First of all, that purse is designer.
467	00:31:56	00:31:57	There's no way I'm ruining it with ink.
468	00:31:57	00:32:01	Second of all, I know where my bread is buttered.
469	00:32:01	00:32:03	Hux was my meal ticket-- kill him, go hungry.
470	00:32:03	00:32:04	Unless you're in the will.
471	00:32:07	00:32:09	Kitties don't get in the will.
472	00:32:10	00:32:13	Besides, if I had touched that thing, wouldn't I have ink on my hands?
473	00:32:13	00:32:15	Hmm.
474	00:32:15	00:32:16	Whoever did it ditched the pen in my bag.
475	00:32:16	00:32:18	It was on the back of my chair the whole time.
476	00:32:18	00:32:19	It could have been anyone.
477	00:32:20	00:32:21	What about the guy who assaulted me?
478	00:32:21	00:32:26	Look, if you really want a suspect, you need to check out little miss chef lady.
479	00:32:26	00:32:28	Little miss chef lady?
480	00:32:28	00:32:29	Why is that? Hello.
481	00:32:29	00:32:32	Duh, she's... Winter Issue?
482	00:32:32	00:32:33	1995.
483	00:32:33	00:32:39	You certainly weren't hiding anything back then.
484	00:32:39	00:32:41	Hmm?
485	00:32:41	00:32:49	Ms. Sanchez, according to your fellow Kitties, you and Huxley had a falling out.
486	00:32:49	00:32:51	It's curious that you didn't mention that.
487	00:32:51	00:32:56	I didn't mention it, because it's ancient history.
488	00:32:56	00:33:00	12 years ago, a misogynist told me I should eat less.
489	00:33:00	00:33:06	And today, I now have a hot restaurant on the Strip and two contracts for spots in L.A. and Chicago.
490	00:33:06	00:33:10	Food Seduction is a best-seller.
491	00:33:10	00:33:12	I think I won that battle already.
492	00:33:13	00:33:16	So, did you and Huxley speak to each other last night?
493	00:33:16	00:33:19	His reservation was booked under a pseudonym.
494	00:33:19	00:33:21	I didn't even know he was there.
495	00:33:24	00:33:28	Mr. Brass, do you know why I started my restaurant?
496	00:33:28	00:33:30	No. Tell me.
497	00:33:30	00:33:34	Because I fell in love with a blind man.
498	00:33:35	00:33:39	He would turn off the lights and feed me.
499	00:33:39	00:33:43	When you deprive one sense, other senses are heightened.
500	00:33:43	00:33:46	My only focus was on my tongue.
501	00:33:46	00:33:48	It was brilliant.
502	00:33:48	00:33:51	And then he died.
503	00:33:51	00:33:54	And this restaurant is an homage to him.
504	00:33:54	00:33:56	To our love affair.
505	00:33:58	00:34:01	How nice for you.
506	00:34:01	00:34:10	I don't mean to be crude, but a murder is, quite frankly, bad for business.
507	00:35:20	00:35:21	Hey. Hey.
508	00:35:22	00:35:26	So, Huxley had honey on his hairpiece, ink in his brain and blood all over.
509	00:35:29	00:35:31	the frisky couple and Michael.
510	00:35:33	00:35:34	April and Michael.
511	00:35:36	00:35:38	two Manducci brothers and all three waiters.
512	00:35:38	00:35:40	Now, that's a lot of lists for Michael to turn up on.
513	00:35:40	00:35:43	He does work there, so there's reason for it, but...
514	00:35:43	00:35:45	Well, there's no reason for this.
515	00:35:46	00:35:48	Michael's print in ink, on a napkin.
516	00:35:48	00:35:51	What would he have against Huxley?
517	00:35:51	00:35:53	His prints hit back to an old work card.
518	00:35:53	00:35:55	The guy used to be a chef.
519	00:35:55	00:35:56	A blind chef?
520	00:35:56	00:35:58	He lost his sight a few years back.
521	00:35:58	00:36:01	But before that, guess who was his sous-chef?
522	00:36:03	00:36:07	The man knew his way around a kitchen, and his way into my heart.
523	00:36:07	00:36:14	Michael would spend hours teaching me, feeding me... loving me.
524	00:36:14	00:36:16	So, you're the dead guy?
525	00:36:16	00:36:23	She seduces me, steals my recipes, my ideas, my investors.
526	00:36:23	00:36:25	And then she hires me as a freaking waiter.
527	00:36:25	00:36:34	Night after night, I listen to her tell stories of the tragic love affair, of the poor, dead blind guy.
528	00:36:34	00:36:37	Last night, I finally confronted her.
529	00:36:38	00:36:40	I deserve a piece of the action.
530	00:36:40	00:36:44	At $200 a head, you're clearing at least $1,000 in tips at night.
531	00:36:44	00:36:46	That's a lot of action for a blind man.
532	00:36:46	00:36:48	I made you.
533	00:36:48	00:36:49	You're fired.
534	00:36:49	00:36:51	We're done.
535	00:36:53	00:36:55	But why kill Huxley?
536	00:36:55	00:36:56	Why not just her?
537	00:36:56	00:37:00	I'm blind. She's not.
538	00:37:00	00:37:03	But in that dining room, everybody else is blind, too.
539	00:37:03	00:37:09	And when Huxley walked in with his Kitties, it was like a sign from the gods.
540	00:37:09	00:37:13	I knew I could destroy her and the restaurant.
541	00:37:15	00:37:17	I waited till the oyster course.
542	00:37:17	00:37:26	The shells clanging, and slurping, the oohing, the aahing, I knew it would cover any noise I was going to make.
543	00:37:33	00:37:39	I wanted her rotting in jail, eating bologna sandwiches.
544	00:37:42	00:37:47	If you wanted to frame Pippa, why did you plant the pen in Shasta's purse?
545	00:37:47	00:37:53	I tell everyone to put their purses and jackets on the back of the chairs, so I knew exactly where her purse was.
546	00:38:04	00:38:08	Old cat frames young Kitty.
547	00:38:08	00:38:12	Kind of perfect.
548	00:38:13	00:38:21	We found high velocity blood spatter inside the rear wheel well of the victim's cart, which means he lost his head at high speed.
549	00:38:21	00:38:25	So how did Hot Rod decapitate Vinnie while racing down a highway at 60 miles an hour?
550	00:38:25	00:38:27	Maybe he didn't.
551	00:38:28	00:38:31	Well, people's heads just don't fly off for no reason.
552	00:38:31	00:38:36	Maybe we should check the scene for some wires or branches, or something he could've run into.
553	00:38:36	00:38:39	If it would've happened that way, we would've found trace from whatever did it.
554	00:38:39	00:38:44	The only trace in the neck and arm wounds was rubber from truck tires.
555	00:38:44	00:38:48	Which was present on both sides of his wounds but not on his clothing.
556	00:38:48	00:38:50	There were blown out tire fragments all over the road.
557	00:38:50	00:38:52	But we found his body off the road.
558	00:38:52	00:38:55	There shouldn't be any transfer from truck tires.
559	00:38:57	00:38:59	Unless...
560	00:39:13	00:39:15	What's going on here?
561	00:39:15	00:39:22	We're trying to determine whether a steel-belted truck tire can decapitate a kid driving a go-cart.
562	00:39:22	00:39:24	I thought that was an urban myth.
563	00:39:24	00:39:29	Myths, legends, tall tales-- they all come from something real.
564	00:39:29	00:39:36	If that go-cart was going 60 miles an hour drafting a truck going the same speed, and that truck blows a tire sending a two-pound projectile into the driver's neck...
565	00:39:36	00:39:40	The combined speed of impact would be 120 miles an hour.
566	00:39:40	00:39:43	Which is about... 962 foot-pounds of energy.
567	00:39:43	00:39:45	All right, let's go, fellas.
568	00:39:50	00:39:53	Come on, Conrad. There's always room for Jell-O.
569	00:39:53	00:39:54	It's expensive Jell-o.
570	00:39:58	00:40:01	I love this.
571	00:40:25	00:40:28	Well, it worked.
572	00:40:29	00:40:31	See if we can't reuse some of that.
573	00:40:38	00:40:41	When did you tell Ecklie we got involved?
574	00:40:42	00:40:45	Two years ago.
575	00:40:45	00:40:47	Why? What did you tell him?
576	00:40:47	00:40:50	Nine years ago.
577	00:40:53	00:40:56	The Forensic Academy Conference?
578	00:40:56	00:40:58	Yeah.
579	00:40:59	00:41:04	You, uh, had too many questions about anthropology for some reason.
580	00:41:04	00:41:05	Well, I was stalling.
581	00:41:05	00:41:08	I was trying to get the nerve to ask you to dinner.
582	00:41:11	00:41:12	You had a ponytail.
583	00:41:19	00:41:22	I'm going to move to Swing.
584	00:41:22	00:41:24	We talked about this.
585	00:41:24	00:41:28	I know that you said that you would do it, but I don't want to do that to the team.
586	00:41:28	00:41:31	Besides...
587	00:41:31	00:41:36	I am sure that I could use more daylight in my life.
588	00:41:44	00:41:48	We should go.
589	00:41:48	00:41:50	Yeah.
590	00:42:13	00:42:14	Whoo!
591	00:42:15	00:42:16	You, uh, you want a ride?
592	00:42:16	00:42:18	Wish I could.
593	00:42:18	00:42:19	What about you, Ricky Bobby?
594	00:42:19	00:42:21	No, thanks, I like to watch.
595	00:42:21	00:42:23	Okay.
596	00:42:24	00:42:26	You should go.
597	00:42:26	00:42:30	Yeah? Yeah, you should go.
