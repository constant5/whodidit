0	00:00:04	00:00:07	You got a husband-and-wife serial team killing couples.
1	00:00:07	00:00:11	Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
2	00:00:11	00:00:14	They were never going to let him go.
3	00:00:14	00:00:16	It's just so sick.
4	00:00:16	00:00:21	We are this close to busting a pair of serial killers, and the judge won't issue a warrant?
5	00:00:21	00:00:22	Hey, I'm just the messenger.
6	00:00:22	00:00:24	The affidavit is standing.
7	00:00:24	00:00:25	You've signed warrants for less.
8	00:00:25	00:00:26	Love is not love.
9	00:00:26	00:00:27	Love is conditional.
10	00:00:27	00:00:29	For most people.
11	00:00:29	00:00:29	But not for you.
12	00:00:29	00:00:31	Then she stuck her tongue in this jerk.
13	00:00:31	00:00:35	Rifkin's ear-- chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.
14	00:00:35	00:00:36	Should get a warrant.
15	00:00:36	00:00:37	Las Vegas Police.
16	00:00:38	00:00:40	We got a problem.
17	00:00:40	00:00:43	Somebody got to our serials before we did.
18	00:00:56	00:00:57	Are you carrying?
19	00:00:57	00:01:00	No.
20	00:01:00	00:01:02	Then get the hell out of here while I secure the room.
21	00:01:30	00:01:33	This is Brass. Yeah.
22	00:01:33	00:01:38	I'm at 11546 Blackbird Lane.
23	00:01:38	00:01:40	Got two gunshot victims.
24	00:01:40	00:01:42	Send rescue.
25	00:01:42	00:01:43	There's no rush.
26	00:01:48	00:01:50	Are those your guys?
27	00:01:52	00:01:54	Yeah, they're UC.
28	00:01:54	00:01:56	How long they been sitting on the house?
29	00:01:56	00:02:02	Oh, about the time that Judge Slater didn't sign the first warrant.
30	00:02:02	00:02:03	Two undercover guys outside.
31	00:02:03	00:02:06	Two dead bodies inside.
32	00:02:06	00:02:08	Makes you feel a little paranoid right now.
33	00:02:08	00:02:10	Not paranoid enough.
34	00:02:58	00:03:00	Alright, Captain. What do you wanna know?
35	00:03:00	00:03:02	So, you guys been here the whole time?
36	00:03:02	00:03:03	Almost.
37	00:03:03	00:03:04	What happened?
38	00:03:05	00:03:06	Tell him.
39	00:03:06	00:03:09	00, there was a 444 call...
40	00:03:09	00:03:11	Citizen reports officer down.
41	00:03:11	00:03:14	2529 Harmon Hill.
42	00:03:14	00:03:16	All units in the vicinity respond.
43	00:03:16	00:03:17	We met up with a couple black-and-whites.
44	00:03:17	00:03:19	UTL.
45	00:03:19	00:03:22	W... What is that?
46	00:03:24	00:03:25	Unable to locate.
47	00:03:25	00:03:27	False alarm. We came right back.
48	00:03:27	00:03:30	Observed no activity in the house until you guys got here.
49	00:03:30	00:03:32	You know we're going to need to see your guns.
50	00:03:32	00:03:35	Why would we off two scumbags when we know you're coming back with a warrant?
51	00:03:36	00:03:37	It wasn't a question.
52	00:03:37	00:03:38	And you're not my supervisor.
53	00:03:40	00:03:41	I am. I want your gun.
54	00:03:42	00:03:44	Give me your gun.
55	00:03:55	00:03:56	Hey, help me out here.
56	00:03:59	00:04:01	And your backups, too.
57	00:04:01	00:04:02	Come on.
58	00:04:14	00:04:16	Satisfied?
59	00:04:16	00:04:17	Just doing my job.
60	00:04:17	00:04:19	Here you go. Fellas, check out the back.
61	00:04:19	00:04:21	Okay? Let's go.
62	00:04:38	00:04:41	These our serials?
63	00:04:42	00:04:43	So it seems.
64	00:04:45	00:04:48	Yesterday's suspects. Today's victims.
65	00:04:48	00:04:49	We had 'em...
66	00:04:55	00:04:57	Take the inside.
67	00:05:05	00:05:06	No sign of forced entry...
68	00:05:07	00:05:09	on this door, at least.
69	00:05:15	00:05:17	Print the handle.
70	00:05:39	00:05:41	What do you think?
71	00:05:46	00:05:48	I don't know what that is.
72	00:05:48	00:05:50	Make sure you get all of it, though.
73	00:05:51	00:05:54	You see any cartridge casings?
74	00:05:54	00:05:55	Not yet.
75	00:06:12	00:06:15	85.5.
76	00:06:17	00:06:21	So TOD 00 p.m.
77	00:06:32	00:06:34	Grissom, I've got blood, but...
78	00:06:36	00:06:38	a lot of pheno-negative stains as well.
79	00:06:38	00:06:40	We're going to bring everything back.
80	00:07:10	00:07:12	What do you got, Warrick?
81	00:07:14	00:07:18	If the killer went out the back door, this may be his print.
82	00:07:22	00:07:24	Good thing Brass had cops watching the house.
83	00:07:24	00:07:30	Linens and towels from the Sphere on top of the washing machine, and what I believe to be sheets from the motel inside the dryer.
84	00:07:30	00:07:31	Both positive presumptive for blood.
85	00:07:31	00:07:35	Think they were being smart taking the sheets, or did they just get off sleeping on 'em?
86	00:07:35	00:07:37	Either way, they were sick and dangerous.
87	00:07:37	00:07:40	What does that say about whoever killed them?
88	00:07:40	00:07:42	Wh-What's the big deal? There's no humans involved.
89	00:07:42	00:07:44	I mean, look, Captain.
90	00:07:44	00:07:47	Come on. The way I see it, somebody did us a favor.
91	00:07:47	00:07:49	Yeah. They're dead. Case is closed.
92	00:07:49	00:07:50	Hey, this isn't a favor, Bill.
93	00:07:50	00:07:52	This is a screwup.
94	00:07:52	00:07:53	Would've been a lot bigger screwup if...
95	00:07:53	00:07:57	if we didn't break surveillance and had an officer down four blocks away.
96	00:07:57	00:07:59	All right, what else did you see?
97	00:07:59	00:08:00	Kid in that house made us.
98	00:08:02	00:08:03	Thought we were bad news.
99	00:08:03	00:08:05	You are bad news.
100	00:08:07	00:08:11	I can't believe Grissom pulled us off that serial murder case.
101	00:08:11	00:08:14	Yeah, well, let me tell you how it ends.
102	00:08:14	00:08:16	They die.
103	00:08:16	00:08:19	Whoa, this isn't half bad for college kids.
104	00:08:19	00:08:23	Yeah. Why live in a one-room flea bag when you can pool your resources and live like this.
105	00:08:23	00:08:26	you, me, Warrick, Nick, Grissom...
106	00:08:26	00:08:29	Oh, can't. Not Grissom.
107	00:08:34	00:08:37	What the hell is this?
108	00:08:37	00:08:39	Ma'am, you may want to take one of these.
109	00:08:39	00:08:41	Thank you. Thanks.
110	00:08:41	00:08:42	Where's the body?
111	00:08:42	00:08:43	Upstairs.
112	00:08:43	00:08:45	Upstairs?
113	00:08:50	00:08:53	It's raining man juice.
114	00:08:53	00:08:55	Hallelujah.
115	00:08:55	00:08:57	You might want to wear those.
116	00:08:57	00:08:58	Thank you.
117	00:08:58	00:09:00	Well, weather's clearing.
118	00:09:00	00:09:02	Yeah, if only the smell would.
119	00:09:06	00:09:08	It's like a sewer in here.
120	00:09:23	00:09:25	Oh, my goodness.
121	00:09:25	00:09:27	Oh, God.
122	00:09:28	00:09:31	Soup's on.
123	00:09:33	00:09:36	How long has he been in here?
124	00:09:36	00:09:38	Roommates last saw him Thursday night.
125	00:09:38	00:09:40	Took off for the weekend.
126	00:09:40	00:09:41	Came home to this.
127	00:09:41	00:09:45	Guy goes to take a shower and DFOs.
128	00:09:45	00:09:46	He never got to the cold water, did he?
129	00:09:47	00:09:49	Roommate said only the hot water faucet was on.
130	00:09:49	00:09:51	Must've been a steam bath in here.
131	00:09:51	00:09:52	Still is.
132	00:09:52	00:09:56	Well, any evidence on the floor's been washed away.
133	00:09:56	00:09:57	There, uh...
134	00:09:57	00:09:59	could be something in the tub.
135	00:09:59	00:10:02	We got to take that body and get it through that door.
136	00:10:02	00:10:04	There's another option.
137	00:10:09	00:10:12	I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th, just east of the intersection.
138	00:10:12	00:10:13	There's been a shooting.
139	00:10:13	00:10:15	I think a cop got shot.
140	00:10:15	00:10:16	John, oh...
141	00:10:16	00:10:17	Just occurred.
142	00:10:17	00:10:18	I heard the shots.
143	00:10:18	00:10:21	I received the call and issued the 444.
144	00:10:21	00:10:25	Uniforms called back a few minutes later, said they checked the area, said it was a UTL.
145	00:10:25	00:10:26	You want to hear that?
146	00:10:26	00:10:30	I'll hear it when you give me a dub of the original caller's voice...
147	00:10:30	00:10:31	and his phone number.
148	00:10:31	00:10:33	I can get that for you right now.
149	00:10:33	00:10:35	Good.
150	00:10:59	00:11:00	Are we done?
151	00:11:01	00:11:03	If I'm not done, you're not done.
152	00:11:03	00:11:08	We already gave you our footprints, and our fingerprints are on file, so what else do you need?
153	00:11:08	00:11:10	Which way is Harmon Hill?
154	00:12:31	00:12:35	So, Bradley, you saw our police officer at that door?
155	00:12:35	00:12:36	Yeah...
156	00:12:36	00:12:38	and I was watching these guys all night.
157	00:12:38	00:12:43	See, the two bad guys drove away in the van, and then the policeman showed up, knocked on the door.
158	00:12:43	00:12:45	Mr. Klinefeld let him in...
159	00:12:45	00:12:46	but he never came back out.
160	00:12:46	00:12:47	Did you see a police car?
161	00:12:47	00:12:49	Must've walked here.
162	00:12:49	00:12:51	Did you hear any gunshots?
163	00:12:51	00:12:52	Nope.
164	00:12:52	00:12:54	Okay, thanks, Bradley. Good job.
165	00:12:54	00:12:56	No problem.
166	00:13:00	00:13:04	Ever see a beat cop anywhere but the Strip?
167	00:13:05	00:13:07	And how'd he beat us to the killer?
168	00:13:14	00:13:15	Trace evidence.
169	00:13:15	00:13:18	Definitely doesn't belong in the wound track.
170	00:13:18	00:13:20	Did your guy get shot through a window?
171	00:13:20	00:13:22	No.
172	00:13:22	00:13:25	We found a lot of this material at the crime scene.
173	00:13:26	00:13:27	Absence of gunshot residue.
174	00:13:28	00:13:32	Maybe he was shot through some sort of object.
175	00:13:32	00:13:38	Well, Mr. Klinefeld was shot once in the front and Mrs. Klinefeld once in the back.
176	00:13:41	00:13:47	Dare I say the couple that slays together, lays together?
177	00:14:30	00:14:33	This drain hasn't been tampered with.
178	00:14:33	00:14:35	It's just clogged.
179	00:14:35	00:14:36	I think this is an accidental.
180	00:14:36	00:14:39	There's nothing but young people stuff.
181	00:14:39	00:14:41	No meds, except some aspirin.
182	00:14:41	00:14:44	No prescriptions.
183	00:14:44	00:14:46	Well, I don't think that means much.
184	00:14:46	00:14:49	Chances are he's not getting his drugs from a medicine cabinet.
185	00:14:49	00:14:50	There's no sign of struggle.
186	00:14:50	00:14:53	Any prints would have been washed away.
187	00:14:54	00:14:56	Where does that leave us?
188	00:14:56	00:15:01	Same place we were when we walked through the door-- with a bloated floater.
189	00:15:04	00:15:07	Hey, you know that cell phone Grissom found at the crime scene?
190	00:15:07	00:15:08	Yeah.
191	00:15:08	00:15:11	Traced it back to a public defender.
192	00:15:11	00:15:13	Said she lost it.
193	00:15:13	00:15:15	Made life hell for her while she was in DC.
194	00:15:15	00:15:17	Mm...
195	00:15:17	00:15:21	Have you run a sample of this through the GCMS?
196	00:15:21	00:15:22	Mm-hmm. Polyethylene.
197	00:15:22	00:15:25	Polyethylene.
198	00:15:25	00:15:28	I got the results back from Grissom's ant puddle.
199	00:15:28	00:15:29	( beep ) Mm-hmm.
200	00:15:29	00:15:33	Corn syrup, glucose, caramel and water.
201	00:15:33	00:15:35	Hang on a second.
202	00:15:38	00:15:40	Where do you keep the sodium rhodizinate?
203	00:15:40	00:15:42	On top of the file cabinet.
204	00:15:42	00:15:43	So, what's up?
205	00:15:43	00:15:45	You and Bobby switched or what?
206	00:15:45	00:15:47	Hey, Rich, whatever happened with those bullets?
207	00:15:47	00:15:49	Six right nine-millimeter.
208	00:15:49	00:15:50	Beretta, amongst others.
209	00:15:50	00:15:52	Consistent with an officer's duty weapon.
210	00:15:52	00:15:55	Consistent with Officer Commons and Officer Nowlin's weapons?
211	00:15:55	00:15:57	No match. That includes backups.
212	00:15:59	00:16:01	Well, thanks.
213	00:16:02	00:16:03	Hey, Warrick.
214	00:16:03	00:16:05	Yeah?
215	00:16:05	00:16:09	Polyethylene plus corn syrup plus GSR gives you what?
216	00:16:09	00:16:13	Polyethylene and corn syrup is... cola in a bottle.
217	00:16:13	00:16:17	GSR on the inside of a plastic bottle means...
218	00:16:17	00:16:19	Soda silencer.
219	00:16:22	00:16:24	Poor man's silencer.
220	00:16:24	00:16:27	Only good for a couple shots.
221	00:16:27	00:16:30	So, that shooter was sitting on the house and the surveillance team.
222	00:16:30	00:16:32	Empties out his bottle of soda...
223	00:16:32	00:16:36	calls in an officer down...
224	00:16:39	00:16:43	...drops the phone and takes a walk.
225	00:16:45	00:16:47	What do you think?
226	00:16:50	00:16:54	Who do we have around here that could find us a somewhat used soda bottle?
227	00:19:54	00:19:55	Hey.
228	00:19:55	00:19:57	Floater's shirt.
229	00:19:57	00:19:59	Took it off his bed.
230	00:19:59	00:20:02	What does this look like to you?
231	00:20:04	00:20:05	A backwards seven.
232	00:20:05	00:20:08	Yeah, that's what I got.
233	00:20:09	00:20:10	What's it doing on a DB's shirt?
234	00:20:11	00:20:13	I don't know.
235	00:20:22	00:20:24	Some kind of greasepaint or makeup.
236	00:20:24	00:20:26	How do you get paint on the inside of your clothes?
237	00:20:27	00:20:29	Rubs off your chest.
238	00:20:29	00:20:32	Oh, what kind of guy paints his chest?
239	00:20:32	00:20:34	Performance artist?
240	00:20:34	00:20:35	A clown maybe?
241	00:20:35	00:20:38	Sports freak.
242	00:20:40	00:20:42	Well, it's not like you to have a one-track mind.
243	00:20:42	00:20:44	If the evidence points to cops, we chase cops.
244	00:20:44	00:20:47	Jesse Commons and Bill Nowlin were doing what I asked them to do.
245	00:20:47	00:20:48	They were sitting on the house.
246	00:20:48	00:20:51	Until you can get enough physical evidence to support a warrant.
247	00:20:51	00:20:53	Somebody knew we were looking at the Klinefelds.
248	00:20:53	00:20:54	They knew where they lived.
249	00:20:54	00:20:55	That's somebody inside.
250	00:20:55	00:20:57	Cops don't take the law into their own hands.
251	00:20:57	00:20:58	Ha! In what city?
252	00:20:58	00:21:00	Oh, you want to hit below the belt?
253	00:21:00	00:21:04	You know, a lot of people had access to the Klinefelds.
254	00:21:04	00:21:08	Who knows, maybe CSI III Nicky Stokes opened up his mouth to another parking lot attendant.
255	00:21:10	00:21:13	There was an eyewitness who saw a uniform at the front door.
256	00:21:13	00:21:18	Oh, come on, a ten-year-old insomniac kid, hyped up on sugar, going blind on X-Box.
257	00:21:18	00:21:20	Who knows what he saw?
258	00:21:20	00:21:21	So, now you're discrediting your own witness?
259	00:21:21	00:21:23	All right, let's break it down.
260	00:21:23	00:21:26	You got a public defender's cell phone, no prints.
261	00:21:26	00:21:29	You got officers' weapons taken from the scene, not fired.
262	00:21:29	00:21:32	You got officers' shoe prints, not matching the evidence print.
263	00:21:32	00:21:36	You got three black-and-whites confirming that Commons and Nowlin responded to a 444.
264	00:21:36	00:21:38	Give these guys a break.
265	00:21:38	00:21:40	Just because they weren't the shooters doesn't mean they weren't involved.
266	00:21:40	00:21:42	Oh, what, so it's a conspiracy? Oh, please!
267	00:21:42	00:21:44	You got a bogus 444 call two blocks away.
268	00:21:44	00:21:45	Oh, come on, you know the deal.
269	00:21:45	00:21:46	You know better than that.
270	00:21:46	00:21:48	There's bogus calls come in every day.
271	00:21:48	00:21:51	Well, maybe you don't, because you're the kind of guy who goes to serve a warrant without a gun.
272	00:21:51	00:21:53	I'm not a cop.
273	00:21:53	00:21:56	Well, that's a distinction that could be lost when the suspect's still inside the house.
274	00:21:56	00:21:58	Look, I had your back.
275	00:21:58	00:22:00	Now I expect you to have mine.
276	00:22:00	00:22:01	That's not the way it works.
277	00:22:01	00:22:02	In what city?
278	00:22:03	00:22:06	Hey, guys? I found something.
279	00:22:06	00:22:07	Not now.
280	00:22:07	00:22:08	No. You need to see this.
281	00:22:10	00:22:11	Both of you. Now!
282	00:22:13	00:22:15	Please.
283	00:22:33	00:22:35	Sorry I didn't find the soda bottle.
284	00:22:38	00:22:40	This'll do.
285	00:22:48	00:22:49	Star-1 Uniforms.
286	00:22:49	00:22:51	It's the biggest uniform shop in town.
287	00:22:52	00:22:55	From casino dealers to cops.
288	00:22:55	00:22:56	Shirt's wet.
289	00:22:56	00:22:58	I found it in a storm drain.
290	00:22:58	00:22:59	Where exactly?
291	00:22:59	00:23:00	Two blocks west of the house.
292	00:23:00	00:23:02	Opposite direction from the 444.
293	00:23:06	00:23:07	Buttons.
294	00:23:08	00:23:10	Meaning?
295	00:23:10	00:23:12	All the new uniforms have zippers.
296	00:23:17	00:23:18	This collar's dry.
297	00:23:18	00:23:22	It's hot out-- at least a buck twenty-five.
298	00:23:22	00:23:24	Let's hope whoever was wearing that shirt sweats.
299	00:23:29	00:23:30	The badge looks legit.
300	00:23:30	00:23:33	I'll run the number.
301	00:23:38	00:23:48	Roommates were unable to make a positive ID due to the accelerated decomposition, but dental records confirmed Daniel O'Hannissey.
302	00:23:48	00:23:53	Laceration on the forehead-- macerated, but not significant.
303	00:23:54	00:23:55	Contusion with a small laceration...
304	00:23:55	00:23:57	here, below the ear.
305	00:23:57	00:23:59	That did some damage.
306	00:23:59	00:24:04	There's an obvious hematoma in the subdural space consistent with a subdural bleed.
307	00:24:04	00:24:07	Herniation of the Uncinate Process on the same side.
308	00:24:07	00:24:09	Doc, uh, why is his brain green?
309	00:24:10	00:24:11	He was steamed.
310	00:24:11	00:24:13	Turns the brain into lime gelatin.
311	00:24:13	00:24:15	Cause of death?
312	00:24:15	00:24:16	Ruled out drowning.
313	00:24:16	00:24:17	There was no water in the lungs.
314	00:24:17	00:24:20	He was dead before he hit the water.
315	00:24:20	00:24:24	So, you are looking at it-- a blow to the back of the head.
316	00:24:24	00:24:26	Resulted in a subdural hematoma.
317	00:24:26	00:24:29	Sort of like a slow leak in a tire.
318	00:24:30	00:24:31	A slow leak in a tire?
319	00:24:31	00:24:34	Odds are Danny had no idea he was bleeding in his brain.
320	00:24:34	00:24:35	He probably felt fine.
321	00:24:35	00:24:37	Maybe a little woozy.
322	00:24:37	00:24:39	Then out of nowhere, he drops.
323	00:24:39	00:24:41	How long do you think he lived after the blow?
324	00:24:41	00:24:42	12 to 24 hours.
325	00:24:44	00:24:48	Well, he had to have been in the water for a couple of days to look like this.
326	00:24:48	00:24:49	Roommates last saw him Thursday.
327	00:24:50	00:24:52	So I guess we start there and we work backwards.
328	00:24:53	00:24:54	Thanks.
329	00:24:54	00:24:55	Yeah.
330	00:24:57	00:24:58	I lost my badge years ago.
331	00:24:58	00:25:01	Filed a report. Got issued a new one.
332	00:25:01	00:25:04	Yeah, I'm aware of officers losing their badges.
333	00:25:04	00:25:06	Then we don't have a problem, do we?
334	00:25:06	00:25:09	No, we got a problem 'cause your badge was found in the proximity of a crime scene.
335	00:25:09	00:25:12	How'd you manage to lose your badge?
336	00:25:12	00:25:15	Such is life.
337	00:25:15	00:25:17	That's not the answer I was hoping for.
338	00:25:17	00:25:19	I've been looking at your jacket.
339	00:25:19	00:25:20	Reads like a novel.
340	00:25:20	00:25:22	You got a lot of entries in here.
341	00:25:22	00:25:24	You got, uh... beat-and-release.
342	00:25:24	00:25:26	You got some stick therapy. What's up with this?
343	00:25:26	00:25:30	Show me a cop without a few entries in his jacket, I'll show you a pogue.
344	00:25:31	00:25:33	You referring to me?
345	00:25:34	00:25:38	Guys like you get to sit on your ass behind a desk because guys like me are out there doing the real work.
346	00:25:38	00:25:41	Okay, tough guy, tell me what you know.
347	00:25:41	00:25:44	I lost my badge. End of story.
348	00:25:44	00:25:47	If I ever find the guy who stole it, believe...
349	00:25:47	00:25:48	I want my union rep.
350	00:25:48	00:25:49	I'm it.
351	00:25:49	00:25:51	I want somebody impartial.
352	00:25:51	00:25:52	Well, I was impartial.
353	00:25:52	00:25:53	Now open up.
354	00:25:58	00:26:00	You went for a bottle and found a shirt?
355	00:26:00	00:26:02	This swab is your new priority.
356	00:26:02	00:26:03	I was just filling Nick in...
357	00:26:03	00:26:04	Fill me in first.
358	00:26:04	00:26:05	The sweat stain?
359	00:26:05	00:26:07	Uh, I was just getting started.
360	00:26:07	00:26:08	I can do them both together.
361	00:26:08	00:26:09	The shoe print?
362	00:26:09	00:26:11	Running it through Limbic.
363	00:26:11	00:26:14	How can you be doing that when you're standing here?
364	00:26:14	00:26:15	I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th.
365	00:26:15	00:26:16	Just east of the intersection.
366	00:26:16	00:26:17	There's been a shooting.
367	00:26:17	00:26:19	I think a cop got shot.
368	00:26:19	00:26:21	John, oh... Just occurred.
369	00:26:21	00:26:22	I heard shots.
370	00:26:22	00:26:23	Where are we?
371	00:26:23	00:26:25	Check it out.
372	00:26:25	00:26:27	I think a cop got shot.
373	00:26:27	00:26:29	John, oh... Just occurred.
374	00:26:29	00:26:30	I heard shots.
375	00:26:30	00:26:32	I have never heard a citizen that calm.
376	00:26:33	00:26:35	This 911 caller knew the drill.
377	00:26:35	00:26:37	He's using officers code.
378	00:26:37	00:26:38	'J' becomes john.
379	00:26:38	00:26:40	'O' becomes ocean.
380	00:26:40	00:26:42	J.O.-- just occurred.
381	00:26:42	00:26:43	Old habits die hard.
382	00:26:44	00:26:44	I'm only halfway home.
383	00:26:45	00:26:46	I need a voice exemplar.
384	00:26:46	00:26:47	Did you get a name off that badge?
385	00:26:47	00:26:48	Yeah.
386	00:26:48	00:26:51	You know, Daniel was from Green Bay.
387	00:26:51	00:26:53	Big-time diehard football fan.
388	00:26:53	00:26:55	He tried to walk-on here, but, uh...
389	00:26:55	00:26:57	didn't make the team.
390	00:26:57	00:27:02	But, hey, come game night, he was always at the stadium.
391	00:27:02	00:27:03	What about the away games?
392	00:27:03	00:27:06	He watched one game at home and lost all of his chill privileges.
393	00:27:06	00:27:08	It was ugly.
394	00:27:09	00:27:10	Define ugly.
395	00:27:10	00:27:12	Busted the couch, jumping on it.
396	00:27:12	00:27:15	Neighbors called the cops 'cause he was so loud.
397	00:27:15	00:27:16	He was a real Bluto.
398	00:27:16	00:27:18	Where else did he 'Bluto'?
399	00:27:22	00:27:23	Everybody knew Dan-o.
400	00:27:23	00:27:26	He's the kind of guy that keeps a place like this in business.
401	00:27:27	00:27:28	I'm going to miss him.
402	00:27:28	00:27:30	When was the last time you saw him?
403	00:27:30	00:27:32	When was the last Rebel game?
404	00:27:32	00:27:34	Thursday.
405	00:27:34	00:27:35	Did you notice anything?
406	00:27:35	00:27:36	Did he...
407	00:27:36	00:27:36	feel okay?
408	00:27:36	00:27:37	Better than okay.
409	00:27:37	00:27:38	He was pumped.
410	00:27:38	00:27:42	He was so pumped that him and some of his buddies got into it with some other guys.
411	00:27:42	00:27:44	Wh-What do you mean? He started a fight?
412	00:27:44	00:27:46	No, Shirley Temple started the fight.
413	00:27:46	00:27:50	Right there! Right there!
414	00:27:51	00:27:53	Drinks for the guys down there.
415	00:27:55	00:27:58	Shirley Temples-- extra cherries.
416	00:27:58	00:28:00	Shirley Temples all around.
417	00:28:02	00:28:03	Hey, Wayne, those are for you, buddy.
418	00:28:03	00:28:05	Those are for you and your boys.
419	00:28:05	00:28:07	How did Shirley take it?
420	00:28:07	00:28:09	Not so good.
421	00:28:09	00:28:11	Come here, tough guy.
422	00:28:14	00:28:16	Yeah!
423	00:28:16	00:28:17	You know how guys are.
424	00:28:17	00:28:19	They scrap until someone gets a touchdown.
425	00:28:19	00:28:22	Yeah. Yeah, right.
426	00:28:22	00:28:25	Do you see any of those guys in here now?
427	00:28:29	00:28:31	There's a couple of Shirleys over there by the big screen.
428	00:28:33	00:28:37	Jen, I need a sample of Fromansky's voice.
429	00:28:37	00:28:39	What's it worth to you?
430	00:28:41	00:28:42	Drinks?
431	00:28:42	00:28:45	I don't think you understand.
432	00:28:45	00:28:47	Officer in pursuit of late-model Honda Civic.
433	00:28:47	00:28:48	Possibly stolen.
434	00:28:48	00:28:50	Heading northbound on Koval Lane.
435	00:28:50	00:28:52	( clicks off tape ) Hold on.
436	00:28:52	00:28:55	Now, I've got three full minutes of Officer Fromansky here.
437	00:28:55	00:29:00	I was thinking of maybe taking it to the Dispatch Convention.
438	00:29:00	00:29:02	Oh, no, no. Okay, okay.
439	00:29:03	00:29:06	Drinks at my place.
440	00:29:06	00:29:08	I can make that dub for you.
441	00:29:08	00:29:09	What time?
442	00:29:30	00:29:31	Got a second?
443	00:29:31	00:29:34	You're a suspect in an ongoing investigation.
444	00:29:34	00:29:36	We're not allowed to have a conversation.
445	00:29:37	00:29:39	Let me tell you something, you arrogant clod.
446	00:29:40	00:29:41	I didn't shoot your suspects.
447	00:29:41	00:29:43	Wouldn't waste my life on them.
448	00:29:43	00:29:47	Well, if that's true, then your DNA sample will rule you out.
449	00:29:47	00:29:51	Someday, you're going to need me or my buddies at a scene...
450	00:29:52	00:29:55	and wouldn't you know it-- we all hit traffic on the way.
451	00:29:57	00:29:59	Is that how you do your job, Officer?
452	00:30:01	00:30:02	Have a safe night.
453	00:30:12	00:30:14	Officer in pursuit of late-model Honda Civic...
454	00:30:14	00:30:15	Just occurred...
455	00:30:15	00:30:16	I heard shots.
456	00:30:16	00:30:17	Heading northbound...
457	00:30:17	00:30:19	Just east of the intersection.
458	00:30:19	00:30:20	There's been a...
459	00:30:23	00:30:26	Pitch, speed, volume-- they're all different.
460	00:30:26	00:30:28	It's not even close.
461	00:30:28	00:30:30	Maybe he disguised his voice.
462	00:30:30	00:30:32	There's no distortion.
463	00:30:32	00:30:34	Fromansky didn't make that call, Gris.
464	00:30:36	00:30:40	The, uh, sweat from the uniform not a match to Officer Fromansky.
465	00:30:54	00:30:57	You're a hard guy to find.
466	00:30:58	00:31:00	I messed up, Jim.
467	00:31:00	00:31:03	I got ahead of the evidence.
468	00:31:03	00:31:05	I made it personal, and I don't know why.
469	00:31:08	00:31:10	We both got a little stubborn.
470	00:31:10	00:31:14	Did a little head-butting.
471	00:31:14	00:31:15	I kind of liked it.
472	00:31:15	00:31:18	You were like your old self there.
473	00:31:18	00:31:19	Anyway...
474	00:31:21	00:31:23	Fromansky was my idea, too.
475	00:31:23	00:31:25	I still think it's somebody inside.
476	00:31:25	00:31:29	Pull off a murder like this, it takes some practice.
477	00:31:29	00:31:32	So... one thing I remembered.
478	00:31:32	00:31:36	About six or seven months ago, we arrested a couple of gang-bangers.
479	00:31:36	00:31:41	They were popping blackjack dealers on their way home from work, taking their toke envelopes.
480	00:31:41	00:31:47	Because of some technicality, Judge Slater let them walk right out of the courtroom.
481	00:31:49	00:31:52	I mean, they were talking about this in the precinct for weeks.
482	00:31:52	00:31:57	Now this morality play has a very quick and unhappy ending.
483	00:31:57	00:31:58	Somebody shot them.
484	00:31:58	00:32:00	Vigilantes?
485	00:32:00	00:32:02	Maybe.
486	00:32:02	00:32:06	But still, I don't like a cop for this.
487	00:32:07	00:32:10	So take the cops out.
488	00:32:10	00:32:12	Who's left?
489	00:32:53	00:32:56	All for Our Country.
490	00:32:56	00:32:59	That's what he probably told himself.
491	00:33:10	00:33:14	Like I told you before, if you're here for a warrant, you better have evidence to back it up.
492	00:33:14	00:33:16	We're not here to get a warrant, Judge.
493	00:33:16	00:33:19	We're here to serve one.
494	00:33:19	00:33:22	Wayne, you want to tell us about the game Friday night?
495	00:33:22	00:33:24	You mean like strategy? Chalk talk?
496	00:33:24	00:33:27	Start with the Shirley Temples and go from there.
497	00:33:28	00:33:30	You're talking about those idiots from UNLV.
498	00:33:30	00:33:33	We have a witness that said you guys had a beef.
499	00:33:33	00:33:35	Specifically, you and Number Seven.
500	00:33:35	00:33:37	Dude, I don't even know those guys, okay?
501	00:33:37	00:33:41	They came in, they tried to be funny, and we set them straight.
502	00:33:41	00:33:42	How?
503	00:33:42	00:33:44	Gave them a little talking to.
504	00:33:44	00:33:46	Any blows exchanged? Physical contact?
505	00:33:46	00:33:49	Did that punk bitch rat us out?
506	00:33:49	00:33:51	It was harmless.
507	00:33:51	00:33:52	It was nothing.
508	00:33:52	00:33:54	Punk bitch?
509	00:33:54	00:33:55	A kid is dead.
510	00:33:56	00:33:57	What?
511	00:33:58	00:34:00	Dan O'Hannissey is dead.
512	00:34:01	00:34:04	I didn't do anything.
513	00:34:04	00:34:07	Hey, that guy left before we did, and he was fine.
514	00:34:07	00:34:08	He was still running his mouth.
515	00:34:08	00:34:10	I suppose your buddies will testify to that?
516	00:34:10	00:34:11	Yeah, they'll testify to that.
517	00:34:11	00:34:13	Look, you can ask anybody who was in there.
518	00:34:15	00:34:17	Interesting ring you've got on.
519	00:34:20	00:34:21	The SMU Sharks.
520	00:34:21	00:34:24	That's a college ring.
521	00:34:25	00:34:26	Mind if I borrow it?
522	00:34:26	00:34:27	You want to borrow my ring?
523	00:34:27	00:34:29	Yeah.
524	00:34:29	00:34:31	Okay.
525	00:34:32	00:34:34	Take it.
526	00:34:35	00:34:36	I didn't do anything.
527	00:34:36	00:34:40	You're not under arrest. You're free to go.
528	00:34:42	00:34:45	You have a lot of nerve walking in my chambers accusing me of murder.
529	00:34:45	00:34:46	I'm not accusing you of murder.
530	00:34:46	00:34:49	I just want to see your shoes.
531	00:34:49	00:34:51	You've a warrant to search my closet? We need to see all your shoes.
532	00:34:51	00:34:53	That goes for your bailiff and your clerk as well.
533	00:34:53	00:34:55	Gentlemen, please remove your shoes.
534	00:34:55	00:34:59	I'm sure you'd want to set an example for all court employees.
535	00:34:59	00:35:01	The warrant is limited to me, my clerk and the bailiff?
536	00:35:02	00:35:09	The Klinefeld warrant was generated from this office, and only you three had access to their personal information, so... yeah.
537	00:35:09	00:35:13	I look forward to the day you return to my courtroom, Detective.
538	00:35:15	00:35:17	Who issued the warrant?
539	00:35:17	00:35:19	Judge Correll.
540	00:35:19	00:35:20	Good judge.
541	00:35:20	00:35:22	Always count on him for paper.
542	00:35:24	00:35:27	Not this pair.
543	00:35:35	00:35:36	Not those.
544	00:35:38	00:35:40	You a smoker?
545	00:35:40	00:35:42	Is that a crime?
546	00:35:42	00:35:44	It's not good for you.
547	00:36:04	00:36:05	What tipped you to the ring?
548	00:36:05	00:36:06	Jaws.
549	00:36:07	00:36:08	Peter Benchley's Jaws?
550	00:36:09	00:36:12	No, it was in Steven Spielberg's Jaws.
551	00:36:12	00:36:15	They had this mechanical shark named Bruce.
552	00:36:15	00:36:17	And he kept swimming round and round in circles.
553	00:36:17	00:36:19	How come?
554	00:36:19	00:36:21	His dorsal fin was bent.
555	00:36:24	00:36:27	How did Bruce's fin get bent?
556	00:36:27	00:36:29	Same way the kid's ring did.
557	00:36:30	00:36:32	It hit something.
558	00:36:33	00:36:36	Don't be pushing, buddy!
559	00:36:36	00:36:38	Come on!
560	00:36:47	00:36:48	Come on. Come on!
561	00:36:48	00:36:50	Come on!
562	00:36:50	00:36:53	Forget it, man.
563	00:36:55	00:36:56	You got to be kidding me.
564	00:36:56	00:36:58	You threw a punch.
565	00:36:58	00:37:00	Probably a sucker punch.
566	00:37:00	00:37:03	Look, I told you, that guy walked away.
567	00:37:03	00:37:04	But he was already dying.
568	00:37:04	00:37:06	And you're responsible.
569	00:37:07	00:37:10	Now who's the punk... bitch?
570	00:37:18	00:37:21	This is Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police Department.
571	00:37:21	00:37:22	Interview Room A.
572	00:37:22	00:37:26	I'm with Stuart Gardner, County Court Clerk.
573	00:37:26	00:37:31	Please, um, state your name.
574	00:37:31	00:37:34	Stuart Gardner. G-a-r-d-n-e-r.
575	00:37:34	00:37:37	And spell it for the record.
576	00:37:37	00:37:38	That's right. You used to be a cop.
577	00:37:38	00:37:41	Once a cop, always a cop.
578	00:37:41	00:37:42	You and I are brothers.
579	00:37:46	00:37:49	I'm not your brother.
580	00:37:57	00:37:58	You're a murderer.
581	00:37:58	00:38:01	I have a warrant to search these premises.
582	00:38:01	00:38:03	This is crap. You can't arrest me.
583	00:38:06	00:38:08	I'm not here to arrest you.
584	00:38:08	00:38:11	What, wait a second...
585	00:38:21	00:38:27	We also found your old uniform shirt, with your DNA on the collar.
586	00:38:29	00:38:31	What are you going to retire on?
587	00:38:31	00:38:34	Psych? Medical? What?
588	00:38:34	00:38:36	Weren't you close to retirement?
589	00:38:37	00:38:39	After you shot that bystander?
590	00:38:39	00:38:41	Ah, you want to talk about me, huh?
591	00:38:45	00:38:48	You're a clerk. Get your facts straight.
592	00:38:48	00:38:49	He wasn't a bystander.
593	00:38:49	00:38:51	He was a passenger in a felony pursuit.
594	00:38:52	00:38:55	So how'd you get promoted to Captain after that?
595	00:38:55	00:38:58	Must be my good looks. You agreed to drive a desk...
596	00:38:58	00:39:02	at CSI... with all the sleazy civilians.
597	00:39:02	00:39:04	Don't knock the CSI, Stuart.
598	00:39:04	00:39:05	They put a lot of bad guys away.
599	00:39:05	00:39:10	You know, I'm going to give you a little therapy for free.
600	00:39:10	00:39:18	You know, if you had only shown a little restraint, they would have processed the DNA after Klinefelds'.
601	00:39:18	00:39:19	Slam-dunk case.
602	00:39:19	00:39:22	Lots of guys get off on slam-dunk cases.
603	00:39:22	00:39:27	Yeah, I bet you saw a lot of that working for Judge Slater, most liberal judge in the state.
604	00:39:27	00:39:34	Bet you saw a lot of good cases go south, while you just processed those release forms, huh?
605	00:39:34	00:39:37	Let me ask you something.
606	00:39:44	00:39:51	Doesn't it piss you off to put all your hard work in the hands of 12 people too stupid to get off jury duty?
607	00:39:55	00:39:58	Stuart, sit down.
608	00:40:03	00:40:07	This guy's a nut job vigilante.
609	00:40:07	00:40:10	He's making the whole department look bad.
610	00:40:10	00:40:14	I guess he'd just figured he'd take a shortcut.
611	00:40:16	00:40:18	You've thought about it.
612	00:40:18	00:40:21	Yeah... lots of times.
613	00:40:23	00:40:25	What about you?
