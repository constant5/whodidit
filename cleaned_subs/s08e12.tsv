0	00:00:03	00:00:04	Nobody knew he was coming.
1	00:00:05	00:00:07	Nobody knew his name.
2	00:00:07	00:00:10	Well, if you'd stop talking for a minute, you'd understand.
3	00:00:10	00:00:12	The investigation's been compromised.
4	00:00:12	00:00:14	Lives are at risk.
5	00:00:14	00:00:18	How many people do the right thing anymore?
6	00:00:18	00:00:19	Have a conscience?
7	00:00:19	00:00:22	Don Cook didn't even know what he saw.
8	00:00:22	00:00:27	El Matocho doesn't kill for the thrill or because he was abused as a child.
9	00:00:27	00:00:30	He kills because it's his answer to everything.
10	00:00:30	00:00:31	I had him eyewitnessed.
11	00:00:31	00:00:33	It was enough for an indictment.
12	00:00:34	00:00:35	No indictment, no trial.
13	00:00:35	00:00:37	He goes free and La Tijera gets stronger.
14	00:00:38	00:00:41	So don't patronize me by saying this might be an accident.
15	00:00:41	00:00:46	I don't care who's on call, Conrad, or about your stupid protocol.
16	00:00:46	00:00:47	I want Grissom.
17	00:00:47	00:00:51	1000 Chestnut and 918...
18	00:00:51	00:00:53	Maybe the reception sucks out here.
19	00:00:53	00:00:56	I said I want Grissom.
20	00:00:56	00:00:58	Say I asked for him personally.
21	00:01:01	00:01:03	I don't want anyone touching anything.
22	00:01:04	00:01:07	Thanks for all your help, guys.
23	00:01:07	00:01:09	Case is reassigned to Grissom.
24	00:01:09	00:01:11	He's home sick, Maddy.
25	00:01:11	00:01:14	Yeah, I heard all about it from Ecklie. Blah, blah, blah.
26	00:01:14	00:01:23	The point that he and you seem to be missing is that I have 18 grand jurists sifting through evidence, trying to help me indict one of the deadliest gangs this city has ever...
27	00:01:23	00:01:24	Who's in charge of the scene?!
28	00:01:26	00:01:27	I am.
29	00:01:27	00:01:29	For God's sake.
30	00:01:33	00:01:35	Madeleine Klein, Deputy DA.
31	00:01:35	00:01:38	Albert Robbins, Clark County Coroner.
32	00:01:40	00:01:43	Talk to me, David.
33	00:01:43	00:01:45	Confirms it's Don Cook.
34	00:01:45	00:01:47	This is on us.
35	00:01:47	00:01:49	What do you got, Doc?
36	00:01:49	00:01:55	Other than the obvious burns over the better part of his body, there's this.
37	00:01:55	00:01:57	He was shot.
38	00:03:07	00:03:09	Let me run it down for you.
39	00:03:09	00:03:16	Isolated stretch of Route 2, burned car on the shoulder, burned male victim out of the car 20 feet away.
40	00:03:16	00:03:19	Single gunshot wound to the lower back.
41	00:03:19	00:03:20	Passing motorist called it in.
42	00:03:20	00:03:23	Fire department arrived within 12 minutes.
43	00:03:23	00:03:28	Fire burned so hot, they had to use foam to put it out, which, of course, is never good for us.
44	00:03:28	00:03:30	Where is he?
45	00:03:33	00:03:35	I've been waiting over an hour for you.
46	00:03:35	00:03:38	What, are you walking here?
47	00:03:38	00:03:43	How many times have I gotten out of bed in the middle of the night for you, Gil?
48	00:03:43	00:03:47	Yeah. Yeah, well, I'd like to phone it in, too.
49	00:03:47	00:03:49	I left an AA meeting for this.
50	00:03:49	00:03:51	Trumps walking pneumonia.
51	00:03:51	00:03:54	Here you go, Eyes-and-Ears.
52	00:03:54	00:03:55	We'll keep in touch.
53	00:03:56	00:04:00	So the Deputy DA got out of bed for you?
54	00:04:00	00:04:01	Whose bed?
55	00:04:01	00:04:02	Talk to me about the road.
56	00:04:02	00:04:04	All right.
57	00:04:04	00:04:12	The debris path starts approximately 100 yards from where the vehicle came to rest.
58	00:04:13	00:04:14	Show me what you see.
59	00:04:32	00:04:34	What are you doing, a catalog shoot?
60	00:04:34	00:04:36	Where's your matching hat with your pom-pom?
61	00:04:36	00:04:39	Leave me alone. I have a cold.
62	00:04:39	00:04:44	So, based on the debris pattern, the victim was driving the car when the blaze started.
63	00:04:44	00:04:47	Swerving all over the road.
64	00:04:47	00:04:49	Probably because he was on fire.
65	00:04:59	00:05:01	What do you think?
66	00:05:01	00:05:03	Sounds about right.
67	00:05:14	00:05:15	Gesundheit.
68	00:05:15	00:05:16	Thanks.
69	00:05:16	00:05:18	Boy, I hope I'm not getting sick.
70	00:05:18	00:05:21	I'm not finding any pour patterns on the exterior.
71	00:05:21	00:05:26	The hood and the front quarter panels are down to the primer and the front tires are burnt down to the rim.
72	00:05:26	00:05:29	Think the fire probably started in the engine compartment.
73	00:05:29	00:05:33	New car engines don't catch fire, not by accident.
74	00:05:33	00:05:35	Now we'll have to get it back to the lab for a closer look.
75	00:05:35	00:05:38	And guys on fire don't stop to close doors.
76	00:05:39	00:05:41	No, no, I talked to the battalion chief about that.
77	00:05:41	00:05:47	He said the driver's side was open when his boys showed up, and that the pressure from the hose probably closed it.
78	00:05:47	00:05:49	Probably?
79	00:05:49	00:05:51	Hosers.
80	00:05:53	00:05:55	Nick, come here.
81	00:06:01	00:06:02	Clear that off, would you?
82	00:06:09	00:06:12	L-A-T. That's La Tijera's tag.
83	00:06:16	00:06:18	Boy, you look like hell.
84	00:06:18	00:06:20	I need sugar. You got a soda?
85	00:06:20	00:06:22	Nice to see you, too, Maddy.
86	00:06:22	00:06:29	Six months' worth of investigation; two months working with the grand jury; five low-level indictments against the LATs.
87	00:06:30	00:06:33	Why you? 'Cause you're the only one who won't screw it up.
88	00:06:33	00:06:36	My team won't screw it up.
89	00:06:36	00:06:37	Oh, right.
90	00:06:37	00:06:39	Your team.
91	00:06:39	00:06:43	Warrick Brown got mixed up with a crooked judge.
92	00:06:43	00:06:46	Sanders ran down a civilian while on duty.
93	00:06:46	00:06:51	Ms. Willows lied about being at a crime scene, among other things.
94	00:06:51	00:06:55	And who can forget Stokes, your straight arrow?
95	00:06:55	00:06:57	Suspected of killing his hooker girlfriend.
96	00:06:57	00:06:59	How does the song go?
97	00:06:59	00:07:01	You call me up, I get 'em out of it?
98	00:07:01	00:07:04	If it weren't for me, you'd have no team.
99	00:07:04	00:07:05	Are you done?
100	00:07:06	00:07:10	Sorry. You have a...?
101	00:07:15	00:07:18	This was recorded two weeks ago.
102	00:07:18	00:07:24	This guy had no idea that what he saw was the key to bringing down La Tijera and their leader El Matocho.
103	00:07:27	00:07:33	Okay, I know this is my third violation, but I was not speeding.
104	00:07:33	00:07:35	I-I blew past that light because I had a fight with my wife.
105	00:07:35	00:07:40	Listen, you're not here for a traffic violation, okay?
106	00:07:40	00:07:46	Now, after you ran the red light, the street camera didn't pick you up at the next intersection. Where'd you go?
107	00:07:46	00:07:51	Okay, look, I, I cannot have my license suspended.
108	00:07:51	00:07:53	I have a vending machine business.
109	00:07:53	00:07:54	You're not here for a traffic violation.
110	00:07:54	00:07:56	Let's get that straight.
111	00:07:56	00:07:57	Now, did you see anyone in particular?
112	00:07:58	00:07:59	You remember that night?
113	00:07:59	00:08:03	Yeah, yeah, no. Um, yeah, there was, there was a guy who walked past my car.
114	00:08:03	00:08:05	Okay.
115	00:08:05	00:08:07	I thought I was gonna get robbed on top of everything else.
116	00:08:07	00:08:10	Can you identify him, hmm?
117	00:08:10	00:08:11	Sure, yeah.
118	00:08:11	00:08:13	He walked under a streetlight. I saw him. I saw him real clear.
119	00:08:13	00:08:15	He, um...
120	00:08:15	00:08:20	He was Hispanic, uh, I don't know, bald, scary-looking.
121	00:08:20	00:08:28	LAT carved into the cheek of the victim is the signature of El Matocho, La Tijera's number one.
122	00:08:28	00:08:33	He killed this guy-- Little Gordo, but he was a ghost; no face, no name.
123	00:08:33	00:08:42	Until Don Cook ID'd Emilio Alvarado coming out of Little Gordo's house around the time of the murder.
124	00:08:42	00:08:47	Turns out Alvarado was caught up in a gang sweep day after the murder. Parole violation.
125	00:08:47	00:08:48	He got 30 days.
126	00:08:48	00:08:50	PD thought he was just another lowlife.
127	00:08:50	00:08:54	Due to be released in 52 hours.
128	00:08:54	00:08:57	Can't indict Alvarado with a dead witness.
129	00:08:57	00:08:59	We need to prove conspiracy.
130	00:08:59	00:09:02	You need to prove that Alvarado ordered a hit on your witness.
131	00:09:03	00:09:07	How long do you think it'll take you to bone up on these and put a suit on?
132	00:09:09	00:09:10	Can I smoke in here?
133	00:09:10	00:09:12	Uh, no.
134	00:09:12	00:09:14	It's a... it's a government building.
135	00:09:17	00:09:20	I'm very sorry for your loss.
136	00:09:20	00:09:22	So when was the last time you saw Don?
137	00:09:22	00:09:25	Last night.
138	00:09:25	00:09:30	We go to my folks' house every Sunday.
139	00:09:30	00:09:34	Mrs. Cook, did you know that your husband was going to testify before a grand jury?
140	00:09:34	00:09:36	We talked about it.
141	00:09:36	00:09:38	I told him I didn't want him to do it.
142	00:09:38	00:09:44	But he found out about this girl, what the gang did to her.
143	00:09:44	00:09:48	Did he confide in anyone else?
144	00:09:48	00:09:50	He said it was a secret.
145	00:09:50	00:09:52	Did you tell anyone?
146	00:09:52	00:09:54	No.
147	00:09:54	00:09:56	Well... sort of.
148	00:09:56	00:09:59	I told my mom and dad and my best friend Jenny.
149	00:09:59	00:10:02	She's my hairdresser. I tell her everything.
150	00:10:02	00:10:05	I'm gonna need their phone numbers.
151	00:10:05	00:10:08	Did I do something wrong?
152	00:10:15	00:10:20	Oh, hey, Dave, nice haircut. What gives?
153	00:10:20	00:10:23	Oh, Mrs. Phillips. An extreme makeover.
154	00:10:23	00:10:27	Mm. Oh, make sure you get those photos to Grissom.
155	00:10:27	00:10:28	I'm all over it.
156	00:10:28	00:10:30	Sign of a good marriage.
157	00:10:30	00:10:32	Wife still wants to change him.
158	00:10:32	00:10:39	So your vic's burns are concentrated on the face, hands, knees and feet.
159	00:10:39	00:10:41	It's consistent with an engine fire.
160	00:10:50	00:10:51	Jacketed hollowpoint.
161	00:10:51	00:10:53	One cannelure. Looks like a .38.
162	00:10:53	00:10:54	Yeah.
163	00:10:54	00:10:56	Entered through the right renal artery.
164	00:10:56	00:10:58	That's COD.
165	00:11:10	00:11:13	Wow. I bet it reeks in here.
166	00:11:14	00:11:16	I wouldn't know.
167	00:11:16	00:11:17	Thank God for stuffy noses.
168	00:11:17	00:11:19	Yeah.
169	00:11:19	00:11:31	DA Klein asked Grissom, who asked Catherine, who told me to tell you that we need to figure out if the victim was shot before he got in the car, while he was in the car or after he got out.
170	00:11:31	00:11:35	Okay, uh, there was no blood trail at the scene.
171	00:11:35	00:11:36	Fire pretty much took care of that.
172	00:11:36	00:11:40	And I doubt you're gonna find any trace of blood in that burnt-up driver seat.
173	00:11:40	00:11:42	Wow, I've got to give her more than that.
174	00:11:42	00:11:43	Be my guest.
175	00:12:05	00:12:08	Skin on a seat belt buckle.
176	00:12:08	00:12:14	You know, if I got shot and I'm trying to get away, I'm not gonna take the time to put my seat belt on.
177	00:12:14	00:12:17	Eliminates the first scenario.
178	00:12:17	00:12:21	So either the shooter kidnaps him and shot him while he was driving... I don't know.
179	00:12:21	00:12:24	Greg, I think we would have found evidence of somebody else inside the vehicle.
180	00:12:24	00:12:27	Which leaves us with the last scenario.
181	00:12:31	00:12:36	I think I just found my reason for getting out of bed this morning.
182	00:12:39	00:12:41	Check it out.
183	00:12:43	00:12:47	The same guy that tampered with the car could have followed.
184	00:12:47	00:12:49	Made sure the job was done.
185	00:12:49	00:12:53	Who killed him? Do you have evidence that the witness was murdered? How did they kill him?
186	00:12:53	00:12:54	One at a time, Miss Leahy.
187	00:12:54	00:12:56	Do you know who killed him?
188	00:12:56	00:12:57	We don't know yet.
189	00:12:58	00:13:00	Our investigation is still ongoing.
190	00:13:01	00:13:03	What was the guy gonna tell us?
191	00:13:03	00:13:09	Until Dr. Grissom can corroborate Mr. Cook's testimony, I can't tell you the content. Mr. O'Shea.
192	00:13:09	00:13:13	We've been locked up in here ten hours a day, two months, all cloak-and-dagger.
193	00:13:13	00:13:19	La Tijera doesn't know we're investigating them, so they couldn't know about the witness.
194	00:13:19	00:13:22	Well, we found their signature at the crime scene.
195	00:13:23	00:13:26	So it's possible they do know.
196	00:13:26	00:13:28	If they got to this witness, could they get to us?
197	00:13:28	00:13:30	I have a family.
198	00:13:30	00:13:31	So do I.
199	00:13:31	00:13:34	I want to know how the gang found out about Don Cook.
200	00:13:34	00:13:35	Me, too.
201	00:13:35	00:13:37	Or else I want off this jury.
202	00:13:43	00:13:46	Hey, I, uh, brought some more files on the case.
203	00:13:49	00:13:51	Got any coffee?
204	00:13:52	00:13:54	I got lots of tea.
205	00:13:54	00:13:55	Good.
206	00:13:57	00:14:02	You know, when we first asked Cook to testify he said no, and, uh, but...
207	00:14:02	00:14:04	you know, I couldn't let it go.
208	00:14:06	00:14:14	So I called him up about a week later and, uh, took him to lunch and I showed him a picture of, uh... of a girl that they had killed, you know.
209	00:14:14	00:14:18	She was 16, innocent, beautiful.
210	00:14:18	00:14:24	She was raped, shot, and urinated on.
211	00:14:24	00:14:29	And when that didn't kill her, they slit her throat.
212	00:14:29	00:14:31	So I had him on the hook.
213	00:14:32	00:14:39	When I told him that, uh, you know, if he testified, I'd protect him and his family if the case ever came to trial.
214	00:14:41	00:14:46	On Friday, he called Maddy, said he changed his mind, he'd testify.
215	00:14:50	00:14:53	And on Sunday...
216	00:14:56	00:14:57	he was dead.
217	00:15:02	00:15:04	I couldn't protect him.
218	00:15:08	00:15:10	Thanks.
219	00:15:31	00:15:32	Hey, buddy.
220	00:15:32	00:15:34	Hey.
221	00:15:34	00:15:35	Oh, man, you look beat up.
222	00:15:35	00:15:37	I feel beat up.
223	00:15:37	00:15:39	Why don't you, uh, take a break. I got this.
224	00:15:39	00:15:42	No, no, I'm cool. I can push through it.
225	00:15:42	00:15:43	Yeah.
226	00:15:45	00:15:50	You're, uh, breaking the Lab's budget for rubber gloves here, dawg.
227	00:15:51	00:15:54	Listen, get some rest, man.
228	00:15:54	00:15:56	You'd do the same for me.
229	00:15:56	00:15:58	Yeah, okay.
230	00:15:58	00:16:00	I processed the driver's side.
231	00:16:00	00:16:02	I was about to get to the passenger's side glove box.
232	00:16:02	00:16:04	I owe you one, man.
233	00:16:04	00:16:05	Yeah, you do.
234	00:16:05	00:16:07	(sneezes) Ooh.
235	00:17:34	00:17:36	Mr. O'Malley? Detective Jim Brass.
236	00:17:36	00:17:39	Can I talk to you? Sure.
237	00:17:39	00:17:42	Ballistics has confirmed that your son-in-law was killed with your gun.
238	00:17:42	00:17:44	Wait a minute.
239	00:17:44	00:17:46	You told me this morning he died in a car fire.
240	00:17:46	00:17:49	I know what I told you, but why didn't you tell me about the gun?
241	00:17:49	00:17:52	How did it end up in his car?
242	00:17:52	00:17:54	Go inside.
243	00:17:57	00:17:59	I gave it to him. Why?
244	00:17:59	00:18:01	Because he asked me for it.
245	00:18:01	00:18:03	All right, look, it's got five rounds in it.
246	00:18:03	00:18:05	There's no safety on it.
247	00:18:05	00:18:08	So all I got to do is just point it and shoot it?
248	00:18:08	00:18:11	Yeah. Now look, if you think you're being followed, don't be a hero. Call the police.
249	00:18:11	00:18:14	Hey, look, I begged Donnie not to testify.
250	00:18:14	00:18:16	He and Cody had everything to lose.
251	00:18:16	00:18:18	They were doing great with their vending machines.
252	00:18:18	00:18:24	No grandkids yet, but that's probably 'cause their marriage was shaky already.
253	00:18:24	00:18:26	Cody has her mother's temper.
254	00:18:26	00:18:28	She loved him though.
255	00:18:28	00:18:30	We all did.
256	00:18:30	00:18:33	Look, as long as I'm out here, do you mind if I look around?
257	00:18:33	00:18:34	My wife and daughter are pretty upset.
258	00:18:34	00:18:38	I don't want you guys in here bothering them anymore.
259	00:19:24	00:19:31	CSI Sanders confirmed that the trajectory of the gun lined up with the victim's body as he tried to exit the vehicle.
260	00:19:31	00:19:35	The engine fire would have reached approximately 800 degrees within two minutes.
261	00:19:35	00:19:40	Enough heat was transmitted to the glove box to cause the gun inside to discharge.
262	00:19:40	00:19:42	Witness was killed by his own gun.
263	00:19:43	00:19:45	Do you know who set the fire?
264	00:19:45	00:19:47	No, Your Honor, not yet.
265	00:19:47	00:19:50	CSI found La Tijera's tag painted on the car's rear bumper.
266	00:19:50	00:19:53	You can't charge the entire gang, counsel.
267	00:19:53	00:19:57	Alvarado's set to be released in just over 24 hours. If he gets out...
268	00:19:57	00:19:58	we lose him forever.
269	00:19:58	00:20:00	We need a warrant to search his apartment.
270	00:20:00	00:20:04	I can't give you a warrant just because she doesn't want him to get out of jail.
271	00:20:04	00:20:05	Where's your probable cause?
272	00:20:05	00:20:07	You saw the video.
273	00:20:07	00:20:10	Cook placed Alvarado at the house at the time of the murder.
274	00:20:10	00:20:12	Mere presence.
275	00:20:12	00:20:14	Counsel, I got to get back to my trial.
276	00:20:14	00:20:18	Your Honor, Alvarado is an admitted member of La Tijera.
277	00:20:19	00:20:26	Their initials were carved into the cheek of the murder victim in the house that Alvarado was seen exiting.
278	00:20:26	00:20:28	We need the clothes that Alvarado was wearing that night.
279	00:20:28	00:20:31	Hopefully, he didn't have time to do his laundry.
280	00:20:31	00:20:33	The grand jurors are on board with this?
281	00:20:33	00:20:35	They will be, Your Honor.
282	00:21:03	00:21:04	Hey, Griss.
283	00:21:04	00:21:05	Restocked your case.
284	00:21:06	00:21:07	You were low on batteries and pheno.
285	00:21:07	00:21:08	Thank you.
286	00:21:08	00:21:09	You're welcome.
287	00:21:10	00:21:12	Apartment 5967.
288	00:21:12	00:21:14	Alvarado's crib.
289	00:21:14	00:21:16	Hey, Grissom, I got tickets to the Rebels tomorrow night.
290	00:21:16	00:21:18	If you're feeling any better and you want to check it out.
291	00:21:18	00:21:19	I'll be in bed.
292	00:21:40	00:21:42	You feeling okay?
293	00:21:42	00:21:46	Yeah. My ears are still ringing, though.
294	00:21:46	00:21:48	This place reeks of sulfur.
295	00:21:50	00:21:54	I found about ten of these butane cans so far.
296	00:21:54	00:21:56	Any evidence that's here is gone.
297	00:21:58	00:22:02	Yeah, well, there's burn patterns all over these walls.
298	00:22:02	00:22:05	They must have splashed butane all over everything.
299	00:22:09	00:22:11	And butane dissipates quick.
300	00:22:11	00:22:13	The other guy was probably watching us the whole time.
301	00:22:20	00:22:22	There's nails all over the place.
302	00:22:22	00:22:26	Grissom, I think I found the point of origin.
303	00:22:34	00:22:36	Green plastic.
304	00:22:36	00:22:38	Sugar, butane, and nails.
305	00:22:38	00:22:41	Add some egg whites in a soda bottle.
306	00:22:41	00:22:43	You got a MacGyver bomb.
307	00:22:43	00:22:44	Crude, but it works.
308	00:22:44	00:22:48	I think they were looking to do more than just destroy evidence.
309	00:22:49	00:22:51	You running for warrants, Mitch?
310	00:22:51	00:22:52	Yeah.
311	00:22:52	00:22:54	Impound their cars. You got it.
312	00:23:16	00:23:18	Mitch, I want to see this guy's hands.
313	00:23:21	00:23:23	You ain't a cop, fool.
314	00:23:23	00:23:25	He's bigger than a cop. Show him your hands, princess.
315	00:23:25	00:23:26	They're clean.
316	00:23:26	00:23:28	Want to lick 'em and find out?
317	00:23:28	00:23:30	You think this is a game?
318	00:23:30	00:23:31	Huh?
319	00:23:32	00:23:34	This one's clean.
320	00:23:34	00:23:36	What about this one?
321	00:23:36	00:23:38	Clean.
322	00:23:38	00:23:40	Turn his pockets.
323	00:23:46	00:23:49	Sugar.
324	00:23:49	00:23:50	What's this?
325	00:23:50	00:23:52	You been baking cookies?
326	00:23:52	00:23:55	So, who gave you the order to torch that apartment?
327	00:23:55	00:23:58	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
328	00:23:58	00:24:00	And why that apartment?
329	00:24:00	00:24:02	Who do you know lives there?
330	00:24:02	00:24:04	Nobody.
331	00:24:04	00:24:06	I got a mental illness.
332	00:24:06	00:24:07	I'm a firebug.
333	00:24:07	00:24:08	I'm loco.
334	00:24:08	00:24:11	You're loco? Who knows?
335	00:24:11	00:24:14	Maybe I'll set the lawyer lady's house on fire.
336	00:24:14	00:24:16	Hey, little man with the big mouth.
337	00:24:16	00:24:21	It doesn't matter what you say, 'cause all your boys are going to hear is that you rolled on Alvarado.
338	00:24:23	00:24:25	Just bought yourself another ten years.
339	00:24:25	00:24:27	I'm going to hand-pick your cell mate.
340	00:24:28	00:24:30	Well, that didn't help.
341	00:24:30	00:24:33	That kid wouldn't roll if I gave him a night with Jessica Alba.
342	00:24:33	00:24:35	You're pretty good at making enemies, Maddy.
343	00:24:36	00:24:38	That's why I'm unlisted, divorced and carry a gun.
344	00:24:38	00:24:41	Did you take Cook back to Little Gordo's house?
345	00:24:41	00:24:43	You know, maybe to verify his story?
346	00:24:43	00:24:46	Yeah, I always take my secret witnesses on a bus tour of the hood.
347	00:24:46	00:24:52	You know, when Don Cook first refused to testify that he saw Alvarado come out of Little Gordo's house, you know what I did?
348	00:24:52	00:24:54	I took him to an out-of-town diner and bought him a cup of coffee.
349	00:24:54	00:24:57	What'd you do?
350	00:24:57	00:25:00	I went to Little Gordo's.
351	00:25:02	00:25:05	Damn it.
352	00:25:05	00:25:07	Good job, Maddy.
353	00:25:07	00:25:09	They saw me.
354	00:25:10	00:25:13	I can't even blame it on the booze.
355	00:25:13	00:25:19	All they had to do was trail me back to the courthouse and watch me go into the security entrance with 18 escorted jurors.
356	00:25:19	00:25:20	That's how they knew grand jury.
357	00:25:20	00:25:21	Damn it!
358	00:25:27	00:25:31	This is where you're supposed to say, It's okay. It could happen to anyone.
359	00:25:31	00:25:35	It's not your fault Don Cook is dead.
360	00:25:35	00:25:37	Like hell it isn't.
361	00:25:42	00:25:44	Hey, Nick!
362	00:25:44	00:25:46	You've got an artful tagger.
363	00:25:46	00:25:48	What?
364	00:25:48	00:25:50	Don Cook's car bumper.
365	00:25:50	00:25:52	Gangbanger blended his green with another color.
366	00:25:52	00:25:54	Not visible to the human eye.
367	00:25:54	00:25:55	Of course, I caught it.
368	00:25:55	00:25:57	You mean the GCMS caught it?
369	00:25:57	00:25:59	Well, if that's a hair you want to split.
370	00:25:59	00:26:02	Suspect used green paint with a hint of cerulean blue.
371	00:26:02	00:26:03	Probably for impact.
372	00:26:07	00:26:09	You know, in China people wear masks when they're sick.
373	00:26:09	00:26:12	It's considered impolite to infect your coworkers.
374	00:26:12	00:26:14	Maybe you should go work in China.
375	00:26:14	00:26:17	Maybe you should wear a mask.
376	00:26:19	00:26:24	Now, this is everything Alvarado had and was wearing when they arrested him?
377	00:26:24	00:26:26	Thank you.
378	00:26:51	00:26:54	He's been in isolation for two weeks.
379	00:26:54	00:26:56	I could tell you everything he's got in his cell.
380	00:26:56	00:26:58	They assigned me special.
381	00:26:58	00:27:00	Does he get any yard time? Nope.
382	00:27:00	00:27:01	I take him for hall walks.
383	00:27:01	00:27:04	Not allowed any contact with anybody but me.
384	00:27:04	00:27:05	Why do you need to see him?
385	00:27:05	00:27:07	Just want to rattle his cage a bit.
386	00:27:07	00:27:09	That cool with you? Good luck.
387	00:27:10	00:27:13	Hey, Alvarado, get up.
388	00:27:13	00:27:14	Cell check.
389	00:27:58	00:28:02	So, you always clean your boots with bleach, El Matocho?
390	00:28:04	00:28:06	Something funny?
391	00:28:06	00:28:09	Matocho.
392	00:28:09	00:28:11	Nonsense word.
393	00:28:11	00:28:14	You know where this name comes from?
394	00:28:14	00:28:16	There's a legend in Central America.
395	00:28:16	00:28:19	This man, he woke up in a bad mood.
396	00:28:19	00:28:25	Killed eight members of his family with a machete and then went and had breakfast.
397	00:28:27	00:28:29	Matar.
398	00:28:29	00:28:31	To kill.
399	00:28:31	00:28:33	Ocho. Eight.
400	00:28:35	00:28:38	To kill eight.
401	00:28:38	00:28:41	El Matocho.
402	00:28:45	00:28:47	That's great.
403	00:28:47	00:28:51	The way I see it, you're going to have lots of time to tell all kinds of great stories.
404	00:28:53	00:28:54	Tick-tock.
405	00:28:55	00:28:56	Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
406	00:28:57	00:28:58	Tick-tock.
407	00:29:00	00:29:03	Alvarado is a suspect in three cases.
408	00:29:03	00:29:09	First, he allegedly kills Little Gordo. Then, the only witness who could identify him is killed.
409	00:29:09	00:29:18	And last, but certainly not least, he allegedly orders Raphael Gomez to blow up his apartment. La Tijera is responsible for all three crimes.
410	00:29:18	00:29:22	Tags at both scenes, and Gomez is an admitted member of the gang.
411	00:29:22	00:29:26	According to Hodges, the tagger didn't use spray paint.
412	00:29:26	00:29:29	He used an oil-based specialty paint.
413	00:29:29	00:29:31	Well, that doesn't make any sense.
414	00:29:31	00:29:33	You got photos?
415	00:29:42	00:29:43	Here you go.
416	00:29:53	00:29:56	This L looks like it was stenciled.
417	00:29:59	00:30:03	Then, it looks like the tagger painted over it a second time, to make it look freehand.
418	00:30:03	00:30:04	What?
419	00:30:06	00:30:09	Yeah, those, uh...
420	00:30:09	00:30:11	those do look like brush strokes.
421	00:30:11	00:30:13	Well, gangs don't use paintbrushes.
422	00:30:13	00:30:16	I assumed the tags were authentic.
423	00:30:16	00:30:19	We've been moving in the wrong direction.
424	00:30:19	00:30:21	Cody, come on out here.
425	00:30:21	00:30:25	So, you think this gang messed with Don's car while we were having dinner?
426	00:30:25	00:30:27	That's what we're here to find out.
427	00:30:27	00:30:29	Cody, Mr. Brass wants to talk to you.
428	00:30:29	00:30:31	Hi, Cody.
429	00:30:31	00:30:33	Where was your son-in-law's car parked that night?
430	00:30:33	00:30:35	Right over there.
431	00:30:40	00:30:42	Those are nice. Did you make those?
432	00:30:42	00:30:45	Yeah, a hobby of mine after I lost my job.
433	00:30:45	00:30:46	Forced retirement.
434	00:30:46	00:30:48	You know how it goes. Mmm.
435	00:30:48	00:30:50	Want to buy one? (chuckles)
436	00:30:50	00:30:53	You keep the garage door closed when you're not working?
437	00:30:53	00:30:55	Well, it's not like we have any neighbors.
438	00:30:56	00:31:00	Anything ever gone missing?
439	00:31:00	00:31:04	Sure, Cody's taking stuff all the time.
440	00:31:04	00:31:07	She'd rather spend her money on clothes.
441	00:31:07	00:31:09	Kids.
442	00:31:09	00:31:11	Mind if I take this crate?
443	00:31:11	00:31:13	What for?
444	00:31:13	00:31:15	Fingerprints.
445	00:31:17	00:31:18	Well, you're going to find mine all over.
446	00:31:19	00:31:20	That's why I'm going to get yours, too, sir.
447	00:31:20	00:31:22	So I can exclude you.
448	00:31:22	00:31:23	Follow me.
449	00:31:23	00:31:24	So, let me get this straight.
450	00:31:24	00:31:27	You come to your parents' house for dinner and Don's the only one that leaves.
451	00:31:27	00:31:29	I already told you why I wasn't in that car.
452	00:31:29	00:31:31	My husband and I were arguing.
453	00:31:31	00:31:32	He was yelling at me.
454	00:31:32	00:31:35	Okay, I'm having a hard time keeping it straight.
455	00:31:35	00:31:37	You do like my dress? You don't like my dress?
456	00:31:37	00:31:39	Can we please just not talk about this now?
457	00:31:39	00:31:40	When should we talk about it?
458	00:31:40	00:31:41	Cody, get in the car.
459	00:31:41	00:31:43	No, I'm not going to get in the car.
460	00:31:43	00:31:47	Listen. I loved the dress till I found out it cost 300 bucks.
461	00:31:47	00:31:48	You have a closet full of dresses...
462	00:31:48	00:31:50	Get in the car.
463	00:31:50	00:31:52	No. Not until you apologize.
464	00:31:52	00:31:53	Apologize to my parents!
465	00:31:53	00:31:54	I'm not apologizing.
466	00:31:54	00:31:57	I told him not to call me until the court thing was over.
467	00:31:57	00:31:59	I needed to cool off.
468	00:31:59	00:32:00	My dad says I was lucky.
469	00:32:00	00:32:04	Ma'am, I'm going to need to get your fingerprints, too.
470	00:32:05	00:32:07	I don't like where this is going.
471	00:32:08	00:32:10	It's going downtown.
472	00:32:35	00:32:36	So you killed him.
473	00:32:37	00:32:38	And made it look like a gang did it.
474	00:32:39	00:32:41	And then you could buy all the expensive dresses you want.
475	00:32:41	00:32:43	I loved my husband.
476	00:32:43	00:32:45	I didn't kill him, okay?
477	00:32:45	00:32:46	You don't know me.
478	00:32:46	00:32:48	You don't know my life.
479	00:33:08	00:33:11	I found your fingerprints on a stencil.
480	00:33:11	00:33:16	It was the one with green paint all over it.
481	00:33:16	00:33:22	And the paint from one of your paintbrushes is a match to the car.
482	00:33:24	00:33:29	Your daughter said you disappeared into the garage right after dinner.
483	00:33:29	00:33:34	That's when you stuck the rag in the engine between the catalytic converter and the heat shield.
484	00:33:38	00:33:41	I think we all know what that did. Hmm?
485	00:33:43	00:33:46	Hey, you don't want to say anything, fine.
486	00:33:46	00:33:48	Write him up.
487	00:33:48	00:33:51	Process him.
488	00:33:53	00:33:56	You think the daughter had anything to do with it?
489	00:33:56	00:33:58	How could you?!
490	00:33:58	00:33:59	Cook was her meal ticket.
491	00:33:59	00:34:01	You son of a bitch!
492	00:34:01	00:34:03	You were gonna kill your own daughter?!
493	00:34:03	00:34:05	Over money so you could get our business?!
494	00:34:05	00:34:06	I would never let you get in that car!
495	00:34:06	00:34:10	Well, you didn't try to stop me! You just stood there!
496	00:34:10	00:34:14	How many Sundays did you come over and bitch to your mother about that selfish, ungrateful bastard?!
497	00:34:14	00:34:16	Don wanted to give you the money; I said no!
498	00:34:16	00:34:20	And all those nights Mom and I stayed up talking-- it was about you!
499	00:34:20	00:34:22	You owed me! I hate you!
500	00:34:22	00:34:25	I did you a favor!
501	00:34:31	00:34:35	Never thought I'd be disappointed that we solved a case.
502	00:34:35	00:34:38	Hmm.
503	00:34:38	00:34:40	Court personnel files?
504	00:34:40	00:34:43	Reading upside down is a talent.
505	00:34:43	00:34:46	What are you looking for?
506	00:34:46	00:34:47	The leak.
507	00:34:47	00:34:51	90 minutes after the warrant was issued, Alvarado's apartment went up.
508	00:34:52	00:34:58	So you're looking at the judge, his staff, the clerk that issued the warrant, court reporter, any cops who knew...
509	00:34:58	00:35:02	Yeah, but according to this, everybody cleared.
510	00:35:03	00:35:06	The only ones left are the grand jurors...
511	00:35:07	00:35:09	and Maddy Klein.
512	00:35:14	00:35:15	Thanks for coming in, Arch. I appreciate it.
513	00:35:15	00:35:17	All right. No worries. Wasn't sleeping anyway.
514	00:35:17	00:35:20	Big surf movie marathon on cable right now.
515	00:35:20	00:35:23	Ah. Yeah, Big Wednesday, Endless Summer, Local Boys.
516	00:35:23	00:35:25	Dude. Yeah.
517	00:35:25	00:35:27	So we need to review some phone records, and fast.
518	00:35:28	00:35:30	Okay. It's going to be tough to go fast with that many names.
519	00:35:31	00:35:32	Oh, no. I can narrow it down.
520	00:35:32	00:35:38	It's a 90-minute window, yesterday, 00 noon to 1 Just cell phone calls. Okay.
521	00:35:40	00:35:42	Give me a name and a number.
522	00:35:42	00:35:45	Timothy O'Shea. 702...
523	00:35:49	00:35:51	He called two numbers.
524	00:35:51	00:35:53	Do a reverse lookup.
525	00:35:53	00:35:57	Looks like he called his wife and his home line.
526	00:35:57	00:35:58	Next.
527	00:35:58	00:35:59	Cole Zampas...
528	00:35:59	00:36:01	702-555-014...
529	00:36:01	00:36:03	Jessica Varge...
530	00:36:03	00:36:06	Darby Vance, 555-013...
531	00:36:06	00:36:09	Marie Leahy.
532	00:36:09	00:36:11	Okay.
533	00:36:14	00:36:16	Huh. No user information.
534	00:36:16	00:36:18	It usually means disposable cell phone.
535	00:36:18	00:36:21	Has she called the number before, within the last two weeks?
536	00:36:21	00:36:28	Monday through Friday, both weeks, she called a different disposable cell phone.
537	00:36:28	00:36:29	That's weird.
538	00:36:29	00:36:31	Okay. Try the text messages.
539	00:36:31	00:36:32	Yeah.
540	00:36:37	00:36:39	See the pattern?
541	00:36:39	00:36:47	00 p.m., someone texts her a number, which she then calls the next day.
542	00:36:47	00:36:49	How did they contact you, Miss Leahy?
543	00:36:49	00:36:55	Uh... a few weeks ago, at a gas station near my house, this, uh...
544	00:36:55	00:36:58	this woman comes up to me and, uh...
545	00:36:58	00:37:02	she knows everything about Peter.
546	00:37:02	00:37:05	That's my little brother in Chicago.
547	00:37:06	00:37:08	He's only 19.
548	00:37:08	00:37:11	Got ten years for something he didn't do.
549	00:37:11	00:37:13	And she said they'd get him out.
550	00:37:13	00:37:16	And they did.
551	00:37:17	00:37:21	Guy just confessed and my brother's set to go free.
552	00:37:25	00:37:29	Did that witness die because of me?
553	00:37:31	00:37:34	Can you give us a description of the woman?
554	00:37:35	00:37:42	She was white, uh, short brown hair...
555	00:37:45	00:37:47	I'm sorry.
556	00:37:47	00:37:50	I only seen her once.
557	00:37:52	00:37:55	Alvarado gets out in the morning.
558	00:37:55	00:37:58	It is the morning.
559	00:37:58	00:37:59	Exactly. (slams table)
560	00:38:01	00:38:08	You know, none of these people make a move without a direct order from Alvarado, especially not torching his own place.
561	00:38:08	00:38:09	What are you saying?
562	00:38:09	00:38:10	Well, think about it.
563	00:38:10	00:38:14	When Marie leaked the warrant information, it had to have gone in and out through him somehow.
564	00:38:14	00:38:16	He's the boss.
565	00:38:16	00:38:18	I don't see how; the guy's in complete isolation.
566	00:38:18	00:38:21	They even assigned him a special hand-picked guard.
567	00:38:22	00:38:23	Look.
568	00:38:23	00:38:25	There's no privileges in isolation.
569	00:38:28	00:38:30	laundry, food.
570	00:38:30	00:38:32	The only thing I saw from the outside was a book.
571	00:38:33	00:38:34	They say he's a big reader.
572	00:38:34	00:38:38	But I looked it over; there's nothing.
573	00:38:38	00:38:40	What about all the other books he's been reading?
574	00:38:43	00:38:45	How does Alvarado get his books?
575	00:38:45	00:38:47	It's like a regular library.
576	00:38:47	00:38:53	When a book's checked out, a trustee writes down the inmate's name, booking number and date.
577	00:38:53	00:38:56	Gets checked back in the same way.
578	00:38:56	00:39:00	I need to see every book that Alvarado checked out.
579	00:39:03	00:39:09	What Is the What? The Infinite Plan, and Herzog.
580	00:39:09	00:39:11	Oh... and The Inferno.
581	00:39:11	00:39:13	Alphabetical by author?
582	00:39:14	00:39:15	Mm-hmm.
583	00:39:21	00:39:23	David Eggers.
584	00:39:33	00:39:37	There's pages missing.
585	00:39:39	00:39:43	Allende.
586	00:39:52	00:39:54	How many books has he read in the last 48 hours?
587	00:39:54	00:39:56	Two.
588	00:39:58	00:40:03	He said he didn't like this one; returned it yesterday afternoon.
589	00:40:10	00:40:14	Where's The Inferno?
590	00:40:20	00:40:22	Hold up a minute.
591	00:40:23	00:40:24	Orders to process him out.
592	00:40:24	00:40:26	Just hold him.
593	00:40:38	00:40:41	This is a good book, Mr. Alvarado.
594	00:40:41	00:40:45	Which Circle of Hell would you be in?
595	00:40:45	00:40:47	The Seventh, the outer one.
596	00:40:47	00:40:52	Those who commit violence against others.
597	00:40:54	00:40:57	Souls plunge into a river of boiling blood.
598	00:41:07	00:41:09	Officer, do you have a lighter?
599	00:41:12	00:41:15	No pen, no paper...
600	00:41:15	00:41:18	so you used what you had, huh?
601	00:41:19	00:41:24	A book for paper, and for ink, urine.
602	00:41:24	00:41:30	Once the urine dries, the writing becomes invisible....
603	00:41:31	00:41:36	until it's heated, making the acid in the urine turn brown.
604	00:41:39	00:41:49	Then you, uh, put the book back in the library, another prisoner checks it out, tears out the page, gives it to a visitor, and you get your message out.
605	00:41:50	00:41:51	Yes?
606	00:41:52	00:41:55	Put him back in his house.
607	00:41:56	00:41:59	Mira, usted se va a morir.
608	00:42:25	00:42:27	he was leaving Vegas.
609	00:42:27	00:42:30	Otherwise, he would have killed me himself.
610	00:42:30	00:42:32	You okay?
611	00:42:35	00:42:37	Yeah.
612	00:42:37	00:42:39	Guess now, I owe you one, huh?
613	00:42:39	00:42:42	I don't keep score, Madeleine.
614	00:42:42	00:42:46	You know what, Gilbert?
615	00:42:46	00:42:50	You're the only man I know who's never let me down.
616	00:42:50	00:42:56	Which means that you're either a classic enabler or my soul mate.
617	00:43:34	00:43:36	Hi.
