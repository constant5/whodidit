0,00:00:30,00:00:31,This dress is sick.
1,00:00:31,00:00:33,You'd totally rock it.
2,00:00:33,00:00:34,It looks a little short.
3,00:00:34,00:00:38,"Trust me, guys like when you show a little bit of skin."
4,00:00:39,00:00:41,"I don't know, it's not really me."
5,00:00:41,00:00:45,"Cara, you can't wear baggy jeans and skater shoes your whole life."
6,00:00:45,00:00:47,It's $400!
7,00:00:47,00:00:50,Relax. I swiped Dad's credit card.
8,00:00:50,00:00:52,Lexi... Come on.
9,00:00:52,00:00:53,I'm giving you a makeover.
10,00:01:26,00:01:27,(wolf whistle nearby)
11,00:01:34,00:01:35,People are staring at me.
12,00:01:35,00:01:36,You're hot.
13,00:01:36,00:01:38,Own it.
14,00:01:43,00:01:45,"What's up, Lex? Hey."
15,00:01:54,00:01:56,Your sister?
16,00:01:56,00:01:58,"Yeah, that's Cara."
17,00:01:58,00:02:00,My buddy Pete.
18,00:02:00,00:02:01,Hey.
19,00:02:02,00:02:06,"LEXI: Um, so, Axel and I are gonna split for a while, so you just stay with Pete?"
20,00:02:07,00:02:10,Can't we all just hang out together?
21,00:02:10,00:02:12,"Don't worry, I'll be back in an hour."
22,00:02:20,00:02:21,So...
23,00:02:21,00:02:23,Do you want to go somewhere?
24,00:02:23,00:02:26,I should probably wait here. It's kind of crowded.
25,00:02:27,00:02:30,"I know a place we can hang, just the two of us."
26,00:02:33,00:02:34,Come on.
27,00:02:35,00:02:36,Let's go.
28,00:02:46,00:02:47,(camera shutter clicking)
29,00:02:47,00:02:49,PHILLIPS: Nobody should have to die like this.
30,00:02:49,00:02:55,"Lot of blood drops on the floor over here, so I don't think he puked himself to death."
31,00:02:55,00:02:57,Pretty big gash.
32,00:02:57,00:03:03,I-It looks like somebody cut his throat and just left him to bleed out in the toilet there.
33,00:03:04,00:03:06,The body is still warm.
34,00:03:06,00:03:07,The rigor hasn't even started.
35,00:03:07,00:03:09,He's been dead less than an hour.
36,00:03:09,00:03:10,Hang on a second.
37,00:03:14,00:03:15,You see something?
38,00:03:15,00:03:18,Looks like some type of bug carcass.
39,00:03:18,00:03:19,Could have fallen off the killer.
40,00:03:19,00:03:22,"I'll scoop it up, get it back to the lab."
41,00:03:22,00:03:24,"Yeah, now."
42,00:03:25,00:03:26,There's no wallet.
43,00:03:26,00:03:28,But we got...
44,00:03:28,00:03:29,a cell phone.
45,00:03:29,00:03:32,Maybe we could get an I.D.
46,00:03:32,00:03:33,Locked.
47,00:03:33,00:03:35,Use his thumb.
48,00:03:39,00:03:41,(beeps) Got to love technology.
49,00:03:45,00:03:49,"According to the phone's I.D., the victim's name is Pete Corday."
50,00:03:49,00:03:50,His camera app was open.
51,00:03:50,00:03:54,Some of these pictures were time-stamped right before he was murdered.
52,00:03:54,00:03:57,Maybe he got a shot of the killer.
53,00:03:57,00:03:59,It's him and a girl.
54,00:03:59,00:04:01,PHILLIPS: Looks like he's having a pretty good time.
55,00:04:01,00:04:04,Mm. Right up until someone ended it.
56,00:04:40,00:04:42,Talked to the janitor who found the body.
57,00:04:42,00:04:49,"He said he got suspicious when he saw the ""Closed for Cleaning"" sign on the restroom door. STOKES: Killer was trying to buy more time till the body was found."
58,00:04:49,00:04:51,Got blood in the sink-- he must've cleaned up in here.
59,00:04:51,00:04:55,So the victim's throat was slashed over the toilet to catch the blood.
60,00:04:59,00:05:03,"Then the knife was washed off in the sink, put the sign on the door."
61,00:05:03,00:05:07,"Smart. You know, he was with this girl right before he was murdered."
62,00:05:08,00:05:11,"I figure either she was involved, or at the very least she's a witness."
63,00:05:14,00:05:15,Any idea who she is?
64,00:05:15,00:05:17,No. Finlay's pulling surveillance now.
65,00:05:17,00:05:19,Seeing if we can track her movements.
66,00:05:19,00:05:20,"I mean, maybe somebody knows her."
67,00:05:20,00:05:22,"Well, that's a Dempsey's bag."
68,00:05:22,00:05:24,"Judging by the size, I would say jewelry or makeup."
69,00:05:24,00:05:26,We could show her photo to the store clerks.
70,00:05:26,00:05:29,"If she paid with a credit card, we might be able to get a name."
71,00:05:29,00:05:30,BRODY: Russell.
72,00:05:30,00:05:33,Yeah? Got a lead on our mystery girl.
73,00:05:33,00:05:37,The credit card that she used earlier today belongs to a guy named John Nolan.
74,00:05:37,00:05:41,Nolan. Why do I know that name? He's the director of the crime lab in San Diego.
75,00:05:41,00:05:44,Right. She used his credit card here in Vegas?
76,00:05:44,00:05:46,Did he report it stolen?
77,00:05:46,00:05:50,"Not yet, but according to Nolan's assistant, he's here in town for a family wedding."
78,00:05:50,00:05:52,Nick's talking to him now; says he knows him.
79,00:05:52,00:05:54,Nolan offered him a job a few years ago.
80,00:05:56,00:05:59,"Hey, John... (clears throat softly)"
81,00:06:00,00:06:02,sorry to drag you down here.
82,00:06:02,00:06:04,I thought you were investigating the murder of a young man.
83,00:06:04,00:06:09,"We are, and a person of interest has been using your credit card."
84,00:06:09,00:06:11,Do you recognize that girl?
85,00:06:12,00:06:14,"Oh, my God."
86,00:06:14,00:06:15,It's Cara. Cara?
87,00:06:15,00:06:17,She's my 13-year-old daughter.
88,00:06:19,00:06:20,"Do you, uh..."
89,00:06:20,00:06:23,"do you know the victim, Pete Corday?"
90,00:06:23,00:06:25,"No, I've never seen him before. Who is he?"
91,00:06:25,00:06:28,23-year-old from Phoenix.
92,00:06:28,00:06:31,He's got a couple of misdemeanors for drug possession.
93,00:06:31,00:06:34,Why would she be hanging out with a guy like that?
94,00:06:34,00:06:36,"Where is she, Nick?"
95,00:06:36,00:06:37,Can I see her?
96,00:06:39,00:06:40,(sighs)
97,00:06:40,00:06:42,We don't know where she is.
98,00:06:42,00:06:43,What?
99,00:06:43,00:06:45,When's the last time you saw her?
100,00:06:45,00:06:48,Uh... at 10:00 this morning.
101,00:06:48,00:06:50,She wanted to go to the mall with Lexi.
102,00:06:50,00:06:51,Lexi?
103,00:06:51,00:06:52,"Yeah, my oldest daughter. She's 17."
104,00:06:52,00:06:54,They don't get to see each other very often.
105,00:06:54,00:06:55,Why is that?
106,00:06:55,00:07:00,"Well, after the divorce, Lexi wanted to live with her mother here in Vegas. I was dead set against it."
107,00:07:00,00:07:03,"Tori, my ex. She'd rather be a friend than a parent."
108,00:07:03,00:07:06,Have you talked to either one of them since this morning?
109,00:07:06,00:07:09,"No, I was at a lunch with out-of-town guests."
110,00:07:09,00:07:11,They didn't show up. I texted them-- they never answered.
111,00:07:11,00:07:13,"Okay, what about the ex-wife?"
112,00:07:13,00:07:15,Or family members?
113,00:07:15,00:07:17,No one's heard from them.
114,00:07:17,00:07:18,Give me their phone numbers.
115,00:07:18,00:07:21,"We'll ping their cells, we'll track them down."
116,00:07:21,00:07:22,Of course.
117,00:07:22,00:07:25,And I need a current picture of Lexi.
118,00:07:28,00:07:30,(wry chuckle)
119,00:07:30,00:07:34,It's a picture that was taken at the rehearsal dinner yesterday.
120,00:07:37,00:07:39,I'm gonna find your girls.
121,00:07:39,00:07:41,"If anyone can, it's you."
122,00:07:43,00:07:45,"Hey, boss. Yeah?"
123,00:07:45,00:07:47,"What do you got for me, David?"
124,00:07:48,00:07:50,Hadrurus Arizonensis.
125,00:07:50,00:07:54,Otherwise known as the giant desert hairy scorpion.
126,00:07:54,00:07:58,Nick found a piece of the molted exoskeleton next to Pete Corday's body in the restroom.
127,00:07:58,00:08:00,You were able to trace it? Unfortunately no.
128,00:08:00,00:08:04,The giant desert hairy scorpion is quite common in Nevada.
129,00:08:04,00:08:09,"You know, last spring my cousin Karen went to go put on her running shoes for her daily jog."
130,00:08:09,00:08:11,Didn't know one was hiding in there; it stung her big toe.
131,00:08:11,00:08:12,Was she okay?
132,00:08:12,00:08:16,"Oh, yeah. But the venom is no more harmful than a bee sting."
133,00:08:16,00:08:17,Ah.
134,00:08:17,00:08:20,"Hey, Doc. Hey. I just finished Pete Corday's autopsy."
135,00:08:20,00:08:26,He died from exsanguination due to massive sharp-force trauma. Can you tell us anything about our killer from the wound?
136,00:08:26,00:08:33,"Depth and angle indicate a right-handed individual with considerable strength, in all likelihood male."
137,00:08:33,00:08:35,That rules out the Nolan sisters.
138,00:08:35,00:08:37,Okay. So what do we know?
139,00:08:37,00:08:41,Cara Nolan was with Pete Corday right before he was killed.
140,00:08:41,00:08:43,And now both she and her sister are missing.
141,00:08:43,00:08:46,You think Corday's killer has the girls?
142,00:08:46,00:08:50,"If they saw his face, maybe he took them to keep them quiet."
143,00:08:50,00:08:53,"And if that's the case, we need to find them, fast."
144,00:08:53,00:08:55,Hey. Hey.
145,00:08:55,00:08:58,Were you able to pull up the footage from outside the bathroom?
146,00:08:58,00:08:59,"Uh, that camera was not working."
147,00:08:59,00:09:00,Figures. Yeah.
148,00:09:00,00:09:02,So I retraced the girls' steps.
149,00:09:02,00:09:05,We know that they bought makeup at Dempsey's at 12:53.
150,00:09:05,00:09:09,'Cause that camera was working. And look what I found.
151,00:09:09,00:09:12,"SIDLE: Oh, that's our victim, Pete Corday."
152,00:09:12,00:09:13,Who's the other guy?
153,00:09:13,00:09:15,"Obviously, a close personal friend of Lexi's."
154,00:09:15,00:09:18,I'm putting him through facial recognition right now.
155,00:09:21,00:09:22,(beeping)
156,00:09:26,00:09:29,"SIDLE: He has a rap sheet. Axel Vargas, age 25."
157,00:09:29,00:09:30,"FINLAY: Drug possession, burglary..."
158,00:09:30,00:09:32,pandering? He's a pimp?
159,00:09:32,00:09:33,"No, worse. Look at that."
160,00:09:33,00:09:37,Federal charge-- tried to take an underage girl into Mexico.
161,00:09:37,00:09:39,That sounds like sex trafficking.
162,00:09:39,00:09:42,Maybe that's what he's got planned for Lexi and Cara.
163,00:09:42,00:09:45,What's that tattoo on his neck?
164,00:09:45,00:09:46,Let me zoom in.
165,00:09:49,00:09:50,A scorpion.
166,00:09:56,00:09:58,Nice tattoo on your neck.
167,00:09:58,00:10:00,You like scorpions?
168,00:10:01,00:10:03,They're cool. Keep any as pets?
169,00:10:03,00:10:05,No. Why?
170,00:10:05,00:10:09,We found a piece of a scorpion exoskeleton on the body of a murder victim.
171,00:10:09,00:10:11,"Your buddy, actually."
172,00:10:11,00:10:13,Pete Corday.
173,00:10:13,00:10:17,"We know you were with him, Lexi and Cara Nolan at the mall this afternoon."
174,00:10:17,00:10:19,Now he's dead and they're missing.
175,00:10:21,00:10:23,It's got nothing to do with me.
176,00:10:23,00:10:25,You have a history of forcing young girls into prostitution.
177,00:10:25,00:10:28,"You'd get top dollar for Lexi and Cara, so what happened?"
178,00:10:28,00:10:31,Did Pete decide he wanted to keep the girls for himself?
179,00:10:31,00:10:33,Or maybe he decided he wanted a cut.
180,00:10:33,00:10:35,I didn't kill Pete. Where are the girls?
181,00:10:35,00:10:38,"I'm telling you, I don't know."
182,00:10:38,00:10:40,I met Lexi a week ago at a bar.
183,00:10:40,00:10:43,"She wanted me to meet her at the mall today, so I went."
184,00:10:43,00:10:45,"We hooked up in a dressing room, and I split."
185,00:10:45,00:10:47,Where'd you go? Work.
186,00:10:47,00:10:48,I'm a bartender at McCarthy's.
187,00:10:48,00:10:51,"Cops picked me up in the middle of a shift, too, and I missed a whole day's pay."
188,00:10:51,00:10:54,I'm gonna need to talk to your boss and verify when you showed up.
189,00:10:56,00:11:00,"Nick said Nolan's putting on a brave face, but, obviously, he's upset."
190,00:11:00,00:11:02,"Well, we've both been there."
191,00:11:02,00:11:03,Father's worst nightmare.
192,00:11:03,00:11:06,"Our girls made it. Hopefully, his will, too."
193,00:11:06,00:11:13,"Listen, I want the department to do everything in its power-- resources, personnel, I don't care-- whatever it takes to bring those girls back and close this case."
194,00:11:13,00:11:15,"Absolutely. Oh, and do me a favor."
195,00:11:15,00:11:16,John's a good guy.
196,00:11:16,00:11:19,"As a professional courtesy, let's give him access, keep him up to date."
197,00:11:19,00:11:21,"Yeah, I'll make sure everybody knows."
198,00:11:21,00:11:22,Thanks.
199,00:11:23,00:11:26,Any luck tracking down Lexi and Cara's cell phones?
200,00:11:26,00:11:29,"Thankfully, they're still transmitting."
201,00:11:29,00:11:31,I've triangulated their location to somewhere in North Las Vegas.
202,00:11:31,00:11:33,All right. Can you get any closer?
203,00:11:33,00:11:34,I'm trying.
204,00:11:34,00:11:37,(computer trilling and beeping)
205,00:11:39,00:11:41,(beeping)
206,00:11:41,00:11:45,There they are-- off the 215 near Sahara.
207,00:11:45,00:11:46,Signals aren't moving.
208,00:11:46,00:11:47,Could be where the girls are being held.
209,00:11:47,00:11:50,(sighs) Or where their bodies were dumped.
210,00:11:51,00:11:53,I'll call for backup.
211,00:11:53,00:11:55,(sirens blaring)
212,00:12:10,00:12:11,(sighs)
213,00:12:12,00:12:13,Big search area.
214,00:12:15,00:12:17,"Yeah, but their phones are still transmitting."
215,00:12:17,00:12:19,They should be right around here.
216,00:12:29,00:12:31,I got one.
217,00:12:33,00:12:34,Screen's broken.
218,00:12:37,00:12:38,Here.
219,00:12:42,00:12:44,Their phones were tossed.
220,00:12:45,00:12:47,"(sighs) Yeah, but I don't see any bodies."
221,00:12:47,00:12:48,It means the girls could still be alive.
222,00:12:48,00:12:50,(phone chirps)
223,00:12:50,00:12:53,It opened up to a video.
224,00:12:53,00:12:55,Looks like it was taken inside a vehicle.
225,00:12:55,00:12:58,(beep)
226,00:12:58,00:12:59,LEXI (crying): Where are you taking us?
227,00:13:01,00:13:03,"Please, just let us go."
228,00:13:04,00:13:06,Shut up.
229,00:13:07,00:13:09,My sister's only 13. She's just a kid.
230,00:13:09,00:13:12,"You don't need both of us. Just please, let her go!"
231,00:13:12,00:13:14,(tires screeching) You stupid bitch!
232,00:13:14,00:13:16,(whimpering) Ooh.
233,00:13:16,00:13:19,"Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat."
234,00:13:19,00:13:21,Lexi! (crying): No!
235,00:13:22,00:13:24,Lexi got her captor on camera.
236,00:13:24,00:13:27,"Couldn't see much of his face, but no scorpion tattoo."
237,00:13:27,00:13:29,That wasn't Axel Vargas.
238,00:13:29,00:13:32,"Then who was it, and what does he want with these girls?"
239,00:13:43,00:13:44,Nick!
240,00:13:44,00:13:46,Nick? Just heard the suspect was released.
241,00:13:46,00:13:48,What the hell's going on?
242,00:13:48,00:13:50,"Yeah, his alibi checked out."
243,00:13:50,00:13:53,But he was with Lexi and Cara right before they disappeared.
244,00:13:53,00:13:54,He has to be on the top of the suspect list.
245,00:13:54,00:13:58,"Yeah, I just saw the video that Lexi shot in the abductor's vehicle."
246,00:13:58,00:14:01,It's not Axel Vargas behind the wheel.
247,00:14:02,00:14:05,Do-do you have any idea who the guy was?
248,00:14:05,00:14:08,"Actually, I was hoping you could help us out there, John."
249,00:14:08,00:14:11,You've been running that San Diego office for a long time now.
250,00:14:11,00:14:14,You must have made some enemies along the way?
251,00:14:14,00:14:15,Can you think of anyone who...
252,00:14:15,00:14:19,who might want to snatch up your girls to hurt you in some way?
253,00:14:19,00:14:21,"God, I don't know. I..."
254,00:14:21,00:14:23,A family member of someone you recently put away.
255,00:14:23,00:14:25,Or someone who was recently released from prison?
256,00:14:25,00:14:27,Something like that?
257,00:14:27,00:14:31,We-we just brought down a biker gang that killed a city supervisor. That's good.
258,00:14:31,00:14:34,"Have your lab send that file over right away, and we'll look into it."
259,00:14:34,00:14:36,"In the meantime, I want to take a look at that video."
260,00:14:36,00:14:41,"(sighs) If this is about me, maybe I'll recognize the guy."
261,00:14:45,00:14:47,LEXI (crying): Where are you taking us?
262,00:14:47,00:14:49,Please just let us go.
263,00:14:49,00:14:52,My sister's only 13. She's just a kid.
264,00:14:52,00:14:54,"You don't need both of us. Just please, let her go!"
265,00:14:54,00:14:56,(tires screeching) MAN: You stupid bitch!
266,00:14:56,00:15:00,"Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat."
267,00:15:00,00:15:02,Lexi! LEXI: No!
268,00:15:06,00:15:08,"STOKES: I'm sorry you had to see that, John."
269,00:15:08,00:15:11,Do you recognize him?
270,00:15:11,00:15:13,No.
271,00:15:15,00:15:17,What if they're dead already?
272,00:15:19,00:15:22,"I mean, he had a knife. He's already killed one person today, right?"
273,00:15:22,00:15:25,You shouldn't even be thinking like that.
274,00:15:25,00:15:27,Not when there's a chance they're still alive.
275,00:15:27,00:15:29,We'll work it till we find 'em.
276,00:15:29,00:15:34,"BRODY: It looks like Lexi was trying to send this clip to somebody. She entered this phone number, but it didn't go through."
277,00:15:34,00:15:35,"STOKES: Well, it's a silent call for help."
278,00:15:35,00:15:37,Whose number is that?
279,00:15:37,00:15:38,It's mine.
280,00:15:39,00:15:41,She was trying to send it to me.
281,00:15:41,00:15:44,You weren't in her contact list?
282,00:15:44,00:15:46,I guess not.
283,00:15:46,00:15:52,Lexi and I haven't had much of a relationship since she moved here to live with her mother.
284,00:15:52,00:15:57,"Well, you were the first person she thought of to reach out to when she was in trouble."
285,00:15:57,00:16:00,That's got to mean something.
286,00:16:04,00:16:06,"Okay, all right, where are we?"
287,00:16:06,00:16:10,Did you find out anything about the motorcycle gang that Nolan helped take down?
288,00:16:10,00:16:12,Yeah. Most of them are in prison.
289,00:16:12,00:16:15,San Diego P.D. verified the whereabouts of the others.
290,00:16:15,00:16:18,Is there anyone else who might have had a grudge against Nolan?
291,00:16:18,00:16:24,"Well, Nolan's lab just cracked a series of Mexican cartel murders along the border, but he hasn't received any threats lately."
292,00:16:24,00:16:29,"No, I think if somebody wanted to get back at him, why would they come all the way here to Vegas?"
293,00:16:29,00:16:33,"Right. All right, all right, look, maybe this has absolutely nothing to do with him."
294,00:16:33,00:16:39,"The guy's got two beautiful daughters, right? They're young, they're attractive, they're in the mall."
295,00:16:39,00:16:41,The mall is like a hunting ground for sexual predators.
296,00:16:41,00:16:44,Maybe this was a... a crime of opportunity.
297,00:16:44,00:16:47,"Well, I looked at all the surveillance video from the mall."
298,00:16:47,00:16:54,"Cara and Lexi left through the west doors, but they were alone. Okay, but that doesn't mean that the kidnapper wasn't already following them, right?"
299,00:16:54,00:16:57,"I mean, he could have been laying in wait outside, and then forced them into a car."
300,00:16:57,00:16:58,Hey.
301,00:16:58,00:17:03,"I was looking through Lexi's text messages, and I found something interesting."
302,00:17:03,00:17:08,Seems she has an admirer who likes to send her pictures of his... genitals.
303,00:17:09,00:17:11,I'll take your word for it.
304,00:17:11,00:17:13,"Well, she told the guy to stop, the images kept coming."
305,00:17:13,00:17:23,"When she threatened to share the pics with the cops, the perv wrote back, ""You bitch, you're just like your mother."" FINLAY: He knows Tori Nolan."
306,00:17:23,00:17:24,Did you run the number?
307,00:17:24,00:17:27,Yeah. Came back to a used car salesman named Dennis Hayes.
308,00:17:27,00:17:29,Let's bring him in. Police are trying to track him down.
309,00:17:29,00:17:32,"In the meantime, Sara's gonna talk with Tori Nolan."
310,00:17:34,00:17:36,"Please, let her go! You stupid bitch!"
311,00:17:36,00:17:39,"MAN: Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat."
312,00:17:39,00:17:40,CARA: Lexi!
313,00:17:40,00:17:42,LEXI (crying): No!
314,00:17:42,00:17:43,Is that Dennis Hayes?
315,00:17:43,00:17:45,I'm not sure.
316,00:17:45,00:17:47,I-I've only met him a couple of times.
317,00:17:47,00:17:49,How do you know him?
318,00:17:49,00:17:52,He was a friend of my ex-boyfriend.
319,00:17:52,00:17:54,"Oh, my God. Do you think he did this?"
320,00:17:54,00:17:55,Do you think he took my girls?
321,00:17:55,00:17:56,That's what we're trying to figure out.
322,00:17:56,00:18:04,"Mrs. Nolan, we found some pretty graphic photos and texts that Dennis sent to Lexi."
323,00:18:04,00:18:06,What was the nature of their relationship?
324,00:18:06,00:18:08,She barely knew him.
325,00:18:08,00:18:10,He came to our house for a party once.
326,00:18:14,00:18:18,"Lexi wasn't feeling well, and she went up to bed."
327,00:18:18,00:18:25,"I decided to go check on her about a half an hour later, and she was passed out on the bed."
328,00:18:27,00:18:31,And Dennis was on top of her trying to take her clothes off.
329,00:18:31,00:18:35,"What did you do? Well, I pulled him off of her, and I told him to get the hell out of my house."
330,00:18:35,00:18:36,You called the police.
331,00:18:39,00:18:41,"No, I didn't."
332,00:18:41,00:18:42,Why not?
333,00:18:44,00:18:46,Because we had been drinking.
334,00:18:49,00:18:50,And taking E.
335,00:18:54,00:18:57,"Lexi wanted to try it, and..."
336,00:18:57,00:18:58,I let her.
337,00:18:58,00:19:00,(chuckles)
338,00:19:00,00:19:03,I didn't want the cops to find out.
339,00:19:03,00:19:05,I didn't want them to take her away from me.
340,00:19:05,00:19:11,"You didn't report Dennis Hayes, and now, he may have abducted both of your daughters."
341,00:19:12,00:19:16,Do you have any idea where he could have taken them?
342,00:19:17,00:19:19,I wish I did.
343,00:19:24,00:19:26,What the hell kind of mother are you?
344,00:19:26,00:19:27,Mr. Nolan...
345,00:19:27,00:19:29,You brought that monster into our daughter's life.
346,00:19:29,00:19:31,And now he's taken her and Cara!
347,00:19:31,00:19:34,I didn't know. I should never have let you have custody of Lexi.
348,00:19:34,00:19:35,She didn't want to live with you.
349,00:19:35,00:19:41,"Hey, your daughters are missing, and this is not gonna help us find them. Let's just focus on bringing Lexi and Cara home."
350,00:19:41,00:19:43,Please.
351,00:19:48,00:19:49,All right.
352,00:19:55,00:19:56,(keyboard keys clicking)
353,00:20:00,00:20:02,We still haven't found Hayes.
354,00:20:02,00:20:03,"Please, tell me you got something."
355,00:20:03,00:20:05,"As a matter of fact, I do."
356,00:20:05,00:20:14,"I've been analyzing the video that Lexi took, and from the dashboard, I can tell that the vehicle they were abducted in was a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban."
357,00:20:14,00:20:16,Does Dennis Hayes drive one of those?
358,00:20:16,00:20:18,"No, but I mean, he's a used car salesman."
359,00:20:18,00:20:20,He has access to all kinds of vehicles.
360,00:20:20,00:20:25,"(phone chimes) All right, I'll call the dealership and, uh, I'll see if they have a '86 Suburban in inventory."
361,00:20:25,00:20:26,(phone beeps on)
362,00:20:28,00:20:29,What is it?
363,00:20:38,00:20:40,"(horn honks, siren toots)"
364,00:20:44,00:20:45,Where is she?
365,00:20:45,00:20:47,In the Dumpster.
366,00:20:48,00:20:55,"One of the construction guys accidentally threw out some lighting fixtures, so foreman came back to retrieve 'em, found the body."
367,00:20:57,00:21:00,"(dog barking, siren toots)"
368,00:21:16,00:21:18,She one of the girls?
369,00:21:23,00:21:26,"Yeah, that's Lexi, the older sister."
370,00:21:26,00:21:29,Not the way we were hoping to find her.
371,00:21:29,00:21:30,"No, it's not."
372,00:21:32,00:21:34,Ecchymosis.
373,00:21:34,00:21:37,Means she suffered blunt force trauma to the head.
374,00:21:39,00:21:42,Fresh cuts on the bottoms of her feet.
375,00:21:42,00:21:44,Looks like she tried to run away.
376,00:21:44,00:21:46,Any sign of Cara?
377,00:21:46,00:21:48,She's not in here.
378,00:21:51,00:21:53,Then there's a chance she might still be alive.
379,00:22:27,00:22:29,"Hey, I thought Nick was working this one."
380,00:22:29,00:22:31,He's at the morgue.
381,00:22:31,00:22:34,He wanted to be the one to process Lexi's body.
382,00:22:34,00:22:37,I found a necklace.
383,00:22:37,00:22:39,There's not much blood in the dumpster.
384,00:22:39,00:22:41,She was killed somewhere else and dumped here.
385,00:22:41,00:22:43,They said they searched the house under renovation.
386,00:22:43,00:22:44,No sign of Cara.
387,00:22:44,00:22:47,No evidence the girls were ever held there.
388,00:22:47,00:22:49,What about the other houses in the neighborhood?
389,00:22:49,00:22:51,Unis are still canvassing.
390,00:22:51,00:22:56,One neighbor did report hearing a metallic squeaking sound around 10:30.
391,00:22:56,00:22:58,"Hinges on the doors of the dumpster, maybe?"
392,00:22:58,00:23:02,"By the time she looked out the window, all she could see were taillights speeding away."
393,00:23:02,00:23:03,Some type of SUV.
394,00:23:03,00:23:07,"But if the killer opened these doors, he would've had to have touched the latch."
395,00:23:07,00:23:09,I'll dust for prints.
396,00:23:38,00:23:39,I don't think you should be in here.
397,00:23:41,00:23:43,I had to see her.
398,00:23:45,00:23:47,I'm really sorry.
399,00:23:50,00:23:52,JOHN: Her fingernails are broken.
400,00:23:52,00:23:54,She put up a fight.
401,00:23:55,00:23:57,That's Lexi.
402,00:23:57,00:24:00,Strong. Fearless.
403,00:24:00,00:24:03,"Yeah, just like her old man."
404,00:24:05,00:24:09,That's probably why we butted heads so much.
405,00:24:09,00:24:14,"You know, when she was 12, she wanted to camp out all night for concert tickets and I wouldn't let her."
406,00:24:14,00:24:20,She snuck out of the house and I found her at 2:00 in the morning at the venue with her friends.
407,00:24:20,00:24:22,I dragged her home.
408,00:24:24,00:24:26,She didn't talk to me for a week.
409,00:24:30,00:24:31,This is my fault.
410,00:24:31,00:24:37,"No. No, it isn't. I should've fought harder to keep her after the divorce."
411,00:24:37,00:24:43,"But she was so unhappy. She was acting out, skipping school. I didn't..."
412,00:24:43,00:24:47,"I didn't know what else to do. Don't put yourself through this, man."
413,00:24:50,00:24:52,What happened to Lexi is not your fault.
414,00:24:55,00:24:57,It's not your fault.
415,00:24:58,00:25:01,You're right. I shouldn't be here.
416,00:25:40,00:25:41,(door opens)
417,00:25:41,00:25:43,"Hey, Nick. Just finishing up here."
418,00:25:52,00:25:54,Damn shame.
419,00:25:55,00:26:01,"Nick, sometimes, despite our best efforts, we don't get the result we want."
420,00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
421,00:26:03,00:26:05,You have any news on her sister? No.
422,00:26:05,00:26:08,We're still trying to track down Dennis Hayes.
423,00:26:09,00:26:10,What's her cause of death?
424,00:26:10,00:26:14,She had a significant longitudinal fracture on the back of the head.
425,00:26:14,00:26:17,Crushing blows causing massive cerebral hemorrhaging.
426,00:26:17,00:26:20,And does the injury indicate what type of weapon was used?
427,00:26:20,00:26:23,"Her head was smashed into a very hard, flat surface."
428,00:26:23,00:26:27,Okay. I found traces of stone in the wound.
429,00:26:29,00:26:35,And the fingernail scratches around the ligature marks indicates that she tried to get away.
430,00:26:36,00:26:38,Any evidence of sexual assault?
431,00:26:38,00:26:42,No physical findings. She had consensual sex earlier in the day.
432,00:26:42,00:26:45,DNA can sort out any multiple donors.
433,00:26:45,00:26:47,And what is that bite on her shoulder?
434,00:26:47,00:26:49,"Is that a sting, some type of insect?"
435,00:26:49,00:26:54,"Based on the redness and the inflammation, I think you're right."
436,00:26:54,00:26:57,"Hey, do you think it could be a scorpion sting?"
437,00:26:57,00:27:03,I don't know. Why? I found a piece of exoskeleton on the dead body in the restroom.
438,00:27:03,00:27:05,Same guy Cara Nolan was with.
439,00:27:05,00:27:10,Will you extract some tissue from around the sting and have it analyzed right away? You got it.
440,00:27:12,00:27:13,SIDLE: How's Nolan?
441,00:27:13,00:27:15,He's holding it together as best he can.
442,00:27:15,00:27:20,"This is a guy who sees dead bodies in autopsy every day, but when it's your own kid laying there..."
443,00:27:20,00:27:23,Oof. I can't even imagine.
444,00:27:24,00:27:26,John's a good guy.
445,00:27:26,00:27:28,He doesn't deserve this.
446,00:27:28,00:27:33,Didn't he send you an autographed Chargers jersey a few years ago?
447,00:27:33,00:27:34,"Yeah, Dan Fouts."
448,00:27:34,00:27:40,One of the best passing quarterbacks in the NFL. It was his attempt to lure me to that San Diego office.
449,00:27:40,00:27:44,You ever regret that? Not taking the job out there?
450,00:27:44,00:27:45,No.
451,00:27:45,00:27:48,"I mean, it wasn't a promotion or anything like that."
452,00:27:48,00:27:49,"Yeah, but the money had to be better than here."
453,00:27:49,00:27:51,"Uh, not really."
454,00:27:51,00:27:54,"I mean, San Diego's an expensive town to live in."
455,00:27:54,00:27:58,"Besides, this is my home. I got all my friends here."
456,00:27:58,00:28:01,This is where my family is.
457,00:28:02,00:28:06,"And look, the Chargers got a good football team, but they're no Dallas Cowboys."
458,00:28:06,00:28:07,Those are my boys.
459,00:28:07,00:28:09,Go Cowboys.
460,00:28:10,00:28:12,"Hey, Russell. Mm."
461,00:28:12,00:28:19,Doc confirmed that the sting on Lexi Nolan's shoulder was from a scorpion. Same type as the exoskeleton that Nick found? No.
462,00:28:19,00:28:21,This wasn't a giant hairy scorpion.
463,00:28:21,00:28:29,"The histopath report identified chlorotoxin and maurotoxin, consistent with a deathstalker scorpion."
464,00:28:30,00:28:32,They common to Nevada?
465,00:28:32,00:28:34,Indigenous to Israel.
466,00:28:34,00:28:36,Well then how is she stung by one of these?
467,00:28:36,00:28:38,It had to be intentional.
468,00:28:38,00:28:42,"Some people keep them as pets, which is crazy-- deathstalkers are highly aggressive."
469,00:28:43,00:28:53,"When they sting their victims, the venom rushes into the bloodstream, causing increased heartbeat, blood pressure, and, if enough venom is released, convulsions and death."
470,00:28:53,00:29:01,"Well, now, Doc said that Lexi Nolan died from blunt force trauma, right? Yes, but I think the scorpion sting may have contributed to her death."
471,00:29:01,00:29:08,"See, Lexi had cuts on the bottom of her feet. If she tried to run, with that venom in her system, she wouldn't have gotten very far."
472,00:29:08,00:29:10,Allowing her killer to catch up.
473,00:29:11,00:29:14,So do we know if Dennis Hayes has a thing for scorpions?
474,00:29:14,00:29:16,He's not our guy.
475,00:29:16,00:29:19,Police tracked him down to a motel in Nebraska.
476,00:29:19,00:29:20,He's been there three days.
477,00:29:20,00:29:26,So we know that whoever killed Lexi Nolan had access to a deathstalker scorpion.
478,00:29:26,00:29:30,"And if they're not native to Nevada, then where'd the guy get one?"
479,00:29:31,00:29:36,"Hey, turns out there are seven places in Nevada that sell deathstalker scorpions."
480,00:29:36,00:29:38,"Seven places too many, if you ask me."
481,00:29:38,00:29:41,I guess some people get a kick out of owning something that can kill you.
482,00:29:41,00:29:49,"Deathstalkers only live two to six years, so I got a list of everyone who purchased one from 2008 to now."
483,00:29:50,00:29:56,"BRODY: We cross-reference this with everyone who drives a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban, and we might get our guy."
484,00:29:56,00:29:59,Great minds think alike.
485,00:30:04,00:30:09,Here-- Kieran Clark. 528 Cactus Ridge Lane.
486,00:30:31,00:30:32,LVPD.
487,00:30:33,00:30:35,"OFFICER: Kieran Clark, LVPD."
488,00:30:36,00:30:38,Clear inside.
489,00:30:41,00:30:43,All clear.
490,00:30:43,00:30:44,Nobody's here.
491,00:30:45,00:30:48,That means no Cara.
492,00:30:53,00:30:57,"This is Clark's address, but it doesn't look like he lives here."
493,00:30:59,00:31:02,Terrariums.
494,00:31:02,00:31:04,A lot of them.
495,00:31:16,00:31:18,"Oh! Oh, God."
496,00:31:21,00:31:24,Guess he's not just into scorpions.
497,00:31:30,00:31:32,"Hey, Morgan."
498,00:31:33,00:31:34,Check this out.
499,00:31:34,00:31:36,Stalker photos.
500,00:31:36,00:31:38,Cara Nolan was only in town for the past few days.
501,00:31:38,00:31:41,"What, has he been stalking her the whole time?"
502,00:31:47,00:31:48,Wait a minute.
503,00:31:48,00:31:50,That's somebody else.
504,00:31:50,00:31:52,That's not Cara Nolan.
505,00:31:52,00:31:53,"Who is it, then?"
506,00:31:53,00:31:55,Another victim? I don't know.
507,00:31:55,00:31:58,But whoever she is...
508,00:31:58,00:32:00,she's a dead ringer for Cara.
509,00:32:26,00:32:28,I already heard.
510,00:32:29,00:32:31,You didn't find Cara.
511,00:32:31,00:32:32,No. Not yet.
512,00:32:32,00:32:36,But we know who took her and we know why.
513,00:32:36,00:32:37,A guy named Kieran Clark.
514,00:32:37,00:32:40,There was a-a shrine in that barn.
515,00:32:40,00:32:43,It seems as though the suspect has an obsession with a young woman.
516,00:32:43,00:32:47,"We haven't identified her yet, but she looks just like Cara."
517,00:32:47,00:32:52,He took my two girls because Cara reminded him of someone?
518,00:32:52,00:32:54,"That's what it looks like, yeah."
519,00:32:54,00:32:56,But... only a matter of time...
520,00:32:56,00:32:57,Before we get Cara back.
521,00:32:57,00:32:59,Is that what you're gonna try and sell me?
522,00:32:59,00:33:04,"John, I'm not trying to sell you on-on anything here, but I'm sure as hell not ready to quit."
523,00:33:04,00:33:06,We're gonna find her.
524,00:33:06,00:33:09,No doubt we will.
525,00:33:10,00:33:12,Just like we found...
526,00:33:12,00:33:13,Lexi.
527,00:33:17,00:33:21,I'm sorry about Lexi.
528,00:33:21,00:33:25,"But hey, you can't just fold and throw in now. Come on."
529,00:33:25,00:33:28,"I'm no tourist, Nick."
530,00:33:28,00:33:30,I've run a crime lab for 17 years.
531,00:33:30,00:33:36,"Cara's been missing for 24 hours, and that lunatic already killed Lexi."
532,00:33:38,00:33:42,You and I both know how this thing's probably gonna end.
533,00:33:43,00:33:45,I'm not about to quit.
534,00:33:45,00:33:47,"And you're not, either."
535,00:33:47,00:33:50,(sighs) You hear me?
536,00:33:50,00:33:52,"Hey, look at me."
537,00:33:53,00:33:57,I will find her.
538,00:33:57,00:33:59,"Okay, what do we know about Kieran Clark?"
539,00:33:59,00:34:01,He's known as the Bug Guy.
540,00:34:01,00:34:06,"He goes around to schools and kids' birthday parties, educating them about insects and reptiles."
541,00:34:06,00:34:08,It's terrifying that he works around children.
542,00:34:08,00:34:12,"And the young woman in these photos, the one he's obviously obsessed with?"
543,00:34:12,00:34:15,"SIDLE: According to the police report, her name is Jennifer DeMarcus."
544,00:34:15,00:34:16,She used to work at a pet shop in Henderson.
545,00:34:16,00:34:17,That's where they met.
546,00:34:17,00:34:22,"She had one date with Clark before she realized he was a head case, and then she told him that she wasn't interested."
547,00:34:22,00:34:24,Let me guess-- he wouldn't take no for an answer.
548,00:34:24,00:34:29,"SIDLE: He kept coming around the pet shop, and then he started parking his car in front of Jennifer's apartment at night."
549,00:34:29,00:34:31,She called the police on him several times.
550,00:34:31,00:34:33,Did she get a restraining order?
551,00:34:33,00:34:35,Left town. Moved back to Georgia.
552,00:34:35,00:34:37,Put as much distance between her and Clark as she could.
553,00:34:37,00:34:39,"Clearly, he's still obsessed with her."
554,00:34:39,00:34:41,"So, what do you think?"
555,00:34:41,00:34:47,"Kieran goes to the mall, sees Cara looking very much like Jennifer, and he decides to grab her."
556,00:34:47,00:34:51,"Except Cara was with Pete Corday, so Clark had to get rid of him first."
557,00:34:58,00:35:04,"And by the time he was done with Pete, Cara was with Lexi, so he had to take them both. Right."
558,00:35:04,00:35:08,The stone particles that Nick found in Lexi Nolan's head wound were coated.
559,00:35:08,00:35:14,"I identified a mixture of ethanol, alkylalkoxysilane and isopropyl acetate."
560,00:35:14,00:35:15,Oxysilane?
561,00:35:15,00:35:18,That sounds like a sealant of some kind.
562,00:35:18,00:35:25,"Actually, it's an impregnating sealant, used to protect concrete from water and staining-- uh, primarily walkways, driveways."
563,00:35:25,00:35:32,"There was no evidence of sealant in the Dumpster where Lexi's body was found, which means it had to come from where she was actually murdered."
564,00:35:33,00:35:35,Lexi tried to escape.
565,00:35:35,00:35:39,She was still feeling distress from the scorpion sting.
566,00:35:39,00:35:45,Maybe she was near a driveway when Kieran Clark caught up to her and smashed her head into it.
567,00:35:49,00:35:56,"The sealant in Lexi's wound wasn't entirely cured, meaning that it was probably applied within the last couple of days."
568,00:35:56,00:35:57,Okay. All right.
569,00:35:57,00:36:01,Let's do a search within a five-mile radius of where Lexi's body was found.
570,00:36:01,00:36:05,We're looking for somebody who recently had their concrete driveway sealed.
571,00:36:10,00:36:11,STOKES: Hey. Hey.
572,00:36:11,00:36:12,I heard you got something.
573,00:36:12,00:36:14,Yeah. Lexi's body was found right here.
574,00:36:16,00:36:21,"Two miles away, on Harvard Drive, this house had their driveway sealed on Wednesday."
575,00:36:21,00:36:26,"Now, we know that when Lexi ran she didn't get very far, so Clark's got to be holding Cara somewhere nearby."
576,00:36:26,00:36:28,I should get out there.
577,00:36:28,00:36:29,Wait for backup.
578,00:36:29,00:36:31,I will.
579,00:37:10,00:37:11,LVPD!
580,00:37:11,00:37:12,KIERAN: Get over here.
581,00:37:12,00:37:14,Kieran Clark!
582,00:37:14,00:37:16,CARA: No! Let me go!
583,00:37:18,00:37:19,Drop the knife.
584,00:37:19,00:37:21,Don't come any closer.
585,00:37:22,00:37:23,Put the knife down.
586,00:37:25,00:37:27,I'll slit her throat.
587,00:37:27,00:37:30,"Hey, me and you, we can work this out."
588,00:37:30,00:37:32,But you don't need to hurt her.
589,00:37:32,00:37:35,What I need is for you to leave.
590,00:37:35,00:37:37,"Now, we both know that's not going to happen."
591,00:37:37,00:37:39,Go!
592,00:37:40,00:37:41,I will kill her.
593,00:37:45,00:37:47,I know about the girl from the pet store.
594,00:37:47,00:37:48,"Jennifer-- I mean, isn't that the girl you liked?"
595,00:37:48,00:37:50,I love her. Okay.
596,00:37:50,00:37:52,All right.
597,00:37:52,00:37:54,But she's not her.
598,00:37:54,00:37:57,Her name is Cara Nolan. She's 13 years old.
599,00:37:57,00:37:58,She's never done anything to hurt you.
600,00:37:58,00:38:01,I know...
601,00:38:01,00:38:03,"when you saw her at the mall, you thought..."
602,00:38:03,00:38:06,"""That's Jennifer."" (gasping)"
603,00:38:06,00:38:08,But take a closer look.
604,00:38:09,00:38:10,It's not her.
605,00:38:10,00:38:12,"She's a child, and she..."
606,00:38:12,00:38:13,she needs to go home.
607,00:38:16,00:38:18,You're wrong.
608,00:38:18,00:38:19,She's mine.
609,00:38:21,00:38:24,Let her go. I can't let you take her.
610,00:38:32,00:38:34,It's okay.
611,00:38:34,00:38:36,It's all right. I'm a friend of your dad's.
612,00:38:36,00:38:38,CARA: Thank you.
613,00:38:42,00:38:44,It's gonna be all right.
614,00:38:56,00:38:57,(knock at door)
615,00:39:12,00:39:14,How's she doing?
616,00:39:14,00:39:16,"Physically, she's okay."
617,00:39:16,00:39:18,"She's been through a hell of an ordeal, but..."
618,00:39:19,00:39:21,...she's alive because of you.
619,00:39:21,00:39:23,You never gave up.
620,00:39:24,00:39:27,Thank you for bringing her back to me.
621,00:39:27,00:39:28,You're welcome.
622,00:39:30,00:39:32,"You know, Nick..."
623,00:39:32,00:39:36,I've been thinking about the choices I've made.
624,00:39:36,00:39:38,Working weekends and evenings.
625,00:39:38,00:39:41,"Missing school plays, soccer games."
626,00:39:41,00:39:43,Sometimes going days without seeing my girls.
627,00:39:43,00:39:46,"For years, I've been putting other people's families ahead of my own."
628,00:39:46,00:39:47,I don't want to do that anymore.
629,00:39:49,00:39:50,"So, what are you saying? You're gonna hang it up?"
630,00:39:50,00:39:53,"Well, Cara needs me."
631,00:39:53,00:39:55,Now more than ever.
632,00:39:55,00:39:57,It would be a big loss for your crime lab.
633,00:39:58,00:40:00,Not with you there.
634,00:40:00,00:40:03,"John, we've talked about this. I've already got a job."
635,00:40:03,00:40:05,I'm not asking you to just join the team.
636,00:40:05,00:40:07,I'm asking you to run it.
637,00:40:09,00:40:12,You want me to take over the crime lab in San Diego?
638,00:40:12,00:40:15,I know it would be in good hands with you at the helm.
639,00:40:18,00:40:20,(sighs)
640,00:40:20,00:40:21,(stammering): That's a big job.
641,00:40:21,00:40:25,You don't have to answer me right now.
642,00:40:25,00:40:27,Just promise me... you'll think about it.
643,00:40:33,00:40:34,"Thank you, Nick."
