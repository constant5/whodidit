0	00:00:30	00:00:31	This dress is sick.
1	00:00:31	00:00:33	You'd totally rock it.
2	00:00:33	00:00:34	It looks a little short.
3	00:00:34	00:00:38	Trust me, guys like when you show a little bit of skin.
4	00:00:39	00:00:41	I don't know, it's not really me.
5	00:00:41	00:00:45	Cara, you can't wear baggy jeans and skater shoes your whole life.
6	00:00:45	00:00:47	It's $400!
7	00:00:47	00:00:50	Relax. I swiped Dad's credit card.
8	00:00:50	00:00:52	Lexi... Come on.
9	00:00:52	00:00:53	I'm giving you a makeover.
10	00:01:34	00:01:35	People are staring at me.
11	00:01:35	00:01:36	You're hot.
12	00:01:36	00:01:38	Own it.
13	00:01:43	00:01:45	What's up, Lex? Hey.
14	00:01:54	00:01:56	Your sister?
15	00:01:56	00:01:58	Yeah, that's Cara.
16	00:01:58	00:02:00	My buddy Pete.
17	00:02:00	00:02:01	Hey.
18	00:02:02	00:02:06	Um, so, Axel and I are gonna split for a while, so you just stay with Pete?
19	00:02:07	00:02:10	Can't we all just hang out together?
20	00:02:10	00:02:12	Don't worry, I'll be back in an hour.
21	00:02:20	00:02:21	So...
22	00:02:21	00:02:23	Do you want to go somewhere?
23	00:02:23	00:02:26	I should probably wait here. It's kind of crowded.
24	00:02:27	00:02:30	I know a place we can hang, just the two of us.
25	00:02:33	00:02:34	Come on.
26	00:02:35	00:02:36	Let's go.
27	00:02:47	00:02:49	Nobody should have to die like this.
28	00:02:49	00:02:55	Lot of blood drops on the floor over here, so I don't think he puked himself to death.
29	00:02:55	00:02:57	Pretty big gash.
30	00:02:57	00:03:03	I-It looks like somebody cut his throat and just left him to bleed out in the toilet there.
31	00:03:04	00:03:06	The body is still warm.
32	00:03:06	00:03:07	The rigor hasn't even started.
33	00:03:07	00:03:09	He's been dead less than an hour.
34	00:03:09	00:03:10	Hang on a second.
35	00:03:14	00:03:15	You see something?
36	00:03:15	00:03:18	Looks like some type of bug carcass.
37	00:03:18	00:03:19	Could have fallen off the killer.
38	00:03:19	00:03:22	I'll scoop it up, get it back to the lab.
39	00:03:22	00:03:24	Yeah, now.
40	00:03:25	00:03:26	There's no wallet.
41	00:03:26	00:03:28	But we got...
42	00:03:28	00:03:29	a cell phone.
43	00:03:29	00:03:32	Maybe we could get an I.D.
44	00:03:32	00:03:33	Locked.
45	00:03:33	00:03:35	Use his thumb.
46	00:03:39	00:03:41	(beeps) Got to love technology.
47	00:03:45	00:03:49	According to the phone's I.D., the victim's name is Pete Corday.
48	00:03:49	00:03:50	His camera app was open.
49	00:03:50	00:03:54	Some of these pictures were time-stamped right before he was murdered.
50	00:03:54	00:03:57	Maybe he got a shot of the killer.
51	00:03:57	00:03:59	It's him and a girl.
52	00:03:59	00:04:01	Looks like he's having a pretty good time.
53	00:04:01	00:04:04	Mm. Right up until someone ended it.
54	00:04:40	00:04:42	Talked to the janitor who found the body.
55	00:04:42	00:04:49	He said he got suspicious when he saw the Closed for Cleaning sign Killer was trying to buy more time till the body was found.
56	00:04:49	00:04:51	Got blood in the sink-- he must've cleaned up in here.
57	00:04:51	00:04:55	So the victim's throat was slashed over the toilet to catch the blood.
58	00:04:59	00:05:03	Then the knife was washed off in the sink, put the sign on the door.
59	00:05:03	00:05:07	Smart. You know, he was with this girl right before he was murdered.
60	00:05:08	00:05:11	I figure either she was involved, or at the very least she's a witness.
61	00:05:14	00:05:15	Any idea who she is?
62	00:05:15	00:05:17	No. Finlay's pulling surveillance now.
63	00:05:17	00:05:19	Seeing if we can track her movements.
64	00:05:19	00:05:20	I mean, maybe somebody knows her.
65	00:05:20	00:05:22	Well, that's a Dempsey's bag.
66	00:05:22	00:05:24	Judging by the size, I would say jewelry or makeup.
67	00:05:24	00:05:26	We could show her photo to the store clerks.
68	00:05:26	00:05:29	If she paid with a credit card, we might be able to get a name.
69	00:05:29	00:05:30	Russell.
70	00:05:30	00:05:33	Yeah? Got a lead on our mystery girl.
71	00:05:33	00:05:37	The credit card that she used earlier today belongs to a guy named John Nolan.
72	00:05:37	00:05:41	Nolan. Why do I know that name? He's the director of the crime lab in San Diego.
73	00:05:41	00:05:44	Right. She used his credit card here in Vegas?
74	00:05:44	00:05:46	Did he report it stolen?
75	00:05:46	00:05:50	Not yet, but according to Nolan's assistant, he's here in town for a family wedding.
76	00:05:50	00:05:52	Nick's talking to him now; says he knows him.
77	00:05:52	00:05:54	Nolan offered him a job a few years ago.
78	00:05:56	00:05:59	Hey, John... (clears throat softly)
79	00:06:00	00:06:02	sorry to drag you down here.
80	00:06:02	00:06:04	I thought you were investigating the murder of a young man.
81	00:06:04	00:06:09	We are, and a person of interest has been using your credit card.
82	00:06:09	00:06:11	Do you recognize that girl?
83	00:06:12	00:06:14	Oh, my God.
84	00:06:14	00:06:15	It's Cara. Cara?
85	00:06:15	00:06:17	She's my 13-year-old daughter.
86	00:06:19	00:06:20	Do you, uh...
87	00:06:20	00:06:23	do you know the victim, Pete Corday?
88	00:06:23	00:06:25	No, I've never seen him before. Who is he?
89	00:06:25	00:06:28	23-year-old from Phoenix.
90	00:06:28	00:06:31	He's got a couple of misdemeanors for drug possession.
91	00:06:31	00:06:34	Why would she be hanging out with a guy like that?
92	00:06:34	00:06:36	Where is she, Nick?
93	00:06:36	00:06:37	Can I see her?
94	00:06:40	00:06:42	We don't know where she is.
95	00:06:42	00:06:43	What?
96	00:06:43	00:06:45	When's the last time you saw her?
97	00:06:45	00:06:48	00 this morning.
98	00:06:48	00:06:50	She wanted to go to the mall with Lexi.
99	00:06:50	00:06:51	Lexi?
100	00:06:51	00:06:52	Yeah, my oldest daughter. She's 17.
101	00:06:52	00:06:54	They don't get to see each other very often.
102	00:06:54	00:06:55	Why is that?
103	00:06:55	00:07:00	Well, after the divorce, Lexi wanted to live with her mother here in Vegas. I was dead set against it.
104	00:07:00	00:07:03	Tori, my ex. She'd rather be a friend than a parent.
105	00:07:03	00:07:06	Have you talked to either one of them since this morning?
106	00:07:06	00:07:09	No, I was at a lunch with out-of-town guests.
107	00:07:09	00:07:11	They didn't show up. I texted them-- they never answered.
108	00:07:11	00:07:13	Okay, what about the ex-wife?
109	00:07:13	00:07:15	Or family members?
110	00:07:15	00:07:17	No one's heard from them.
111	00:07:17	00:07:18	Give me their phone numbers.
112	00:07:18	00:07:21	We'll ping their cells, we'll track them down.
113	00:07:21	00:07:22	Of course.
114	00:07:22	00:07:25	And I need a current picture of Lexi.
115	00:07:30	00:07:34	It's a picture that was taken at the rehearsal dinner yesterday.
116	00:07:37	00:07:39	I'm gonna find your girls.
117	00:07:39	00:07:41	If anyone can, it's you.
118	00:07:43	00:07:45	Hey, boss. Yeah?
119	00:07:45	00:07:47	What do you got for me, David?
120	00:07:48	00:07:50	Hadrurus Arizonensis.
121	00:07:50	00:07:54	Otherwise known as the giant desert hairy scorpion.
122	00:07:54	00:07:58	Nick found a piece of the molted exoskeleton next to Pete Corday's body in the restroom.
123	00:07:58	00:08:00	You were able to trace it? Unfortunately no.
124	00:08:00	00:08:04	The giant desert hairy scorpion is quite common in Nevada.
125	00:08:04	00:08:09	You know, last spring my cousin Karen went to go put on her running shoes for her daily jog.
126	00:08:09	00:08:11	Didn't know one was hiding in there; it stung her big toe.
127	00:08:11	00:08:12	Was she okay?
128	00:08:12	00:08:16	Oh, yeah. But the venom is no more harmful than a bee sting.
129	00:08:16	00:08:17	Ah.
130	00:08:17	00:08:20	Hey, Doc. Hey. I just finished Pete Corday's autopsy.
131	00:08:20	00:08:26	He died from exsanguination due to massive sharp-force trauma. Can you tell us anything about our killer from the wound?
132	00:08:26	00:08:33	Depth and angle indicate a right-handed individual with considerable strength, in all likelihood male.
133	00:08:33	00:08:35	That rules out the Nolan sisters.
134	00:08:35	00:08:37	Okay. So what do we know?
135	00:08:37	00:08:41	Cara Nolan was with Pete Corday right before he was killed.
136	00:08:41	00:08:43	And now both she and her sister are missing.
137	00:08:43	00:08:46	You think Corday's killer has the girls?
138	00:08:46	00:08:50	If they saw his face, maybe he took them to keep them quiet.
139	00:08:50	00:08:53	And if that's the case, we need to find them, fast.
140	00:08:53	00:08:55	Hey. Hey.
141	00:08:55	00:08:58	Were you able to pull up the footage from outside the bathroom?
142	00:08:58	00:08:59	Uh, that camera was not working.
143	00:08:59	00:09:00	Figures. Yeah.
144	00:09:00	00:09:02	So I retraced the girls' steps.
145	00:09:02	00:09:05	53.
146	00:09:05	00:09:09	'Cause that camera was working. And look what I found.
147	00:09:09	00:09:12	Oh, that's our victim, Pete Corday.
148	00:09:12	00:09:13	Who's the other guy?
149	00:09:13	00:09:15	Obviously, a close personal friend of Lexi's.
150	00:09:15	00:09:18	I'm putting him through facial recognition right now.
151	00:09:26	00:09:29	He has a rap sheet. Axel Vargas, age 25.
152	00:09:29	00:09:30	Drug possession, burglary...
153	00:09:30	00:09:32	pandering? He's a pimp?
154	00:09:32	00:09:33	No, worse. Look at that.
155	00:09:33	00:09:37	Federal charge-- tried to take an underage girl into Mexico.
156	00:09:37	00:09:39	That sounds like sex trafficking.
157	00:09:39	00:09:42	Maybe that's what he's got planned for Lexi and Cara.
158	00:09:42	00:09:45	What's that tattoo on his neck?
159	00:09:45	00:09:46	Let me zoom in.
160	00:09:49	00:09:50	A scorpion.
161	00:09:56	00:09:58	Nice tattoo on your neck.
162	00:09:58	00:10:00	You like scorpions?
163	00:10:01	00:10:03	They're cool. Keep any as pets?
164	00:10:03	00:10:05	No. Why?
165	00:10:05	00:10:09	We found a piece of a scorpion exoskeleton on the body of a murder victim.
166	00:10:09	00:10:11	Your buddy, actually.
167	00:10:11	00:10:13	Pete Corday.
168	00:10:13	00:10:17	We know you were with him, Lexi and Cara Nolan at the mall this afternoon.
169	00:10:17	00:10:19	Now he's dead and they're missing.
170	00:10:21	00:10:23	It's got nothing to do with me.
171	00:10:23	00:10:25	You have a history of forcing young girls into prostitution.
172	00:10:25	00:10:28	You'd get top dollar for Lexi and Cara, so what happened?
173	00:10:28	00:10:31	Did Pete decide he wanted to keep the girls for himself?
174	00:10:31	00:10:33	Or maybe he decided he wanted a cut.
175	00:10:33	00:10:35	I didn't kill Pete. Where are the girls?
176	00:10:35	00:10:38	I'm telling you, I don't know.
177	00:10:38	00:10:40	I met Lexi a week ago at a bar.
178	00:10:40	00:10:43	She wanted me to meet her at the mall today, so I went.
179	00:10:43	00:10:45	We hooked up in a dressing room, and I split.
180	00:10:45	00:10:47	Where'd you go? Work.
181	00:10:47	00:10:48	I'm a bartender at McCarthy's.
182	00:10:48	00:10:51	Cops picked me up in the middle of a shift, too, and I missed a whole day's pay.
183	00:10:51	00:10:54	I'm gonna need to talk to your boss and verify when you showed up.
184	00:10:56	00:11:00	Nick said Nolan's putting on a brave face, but, obviously, he's upset.
185	00:11:00	00:11:02	Well, we've both been there.
186	00:11:02	00:11:03	Father's worst nightmare.
187	00:11:03	00:11:06	Our girls made it. Hopefully, his will, too.
188	00:11:06	00:11:13	Listen, I want the department to do everything in its power-- resources, personnel, I don't care-- whatever it takes to bring those girls back and close this case.
189	00:11:13	00:11:15	Absolutely. Oh, and do me a favor.
190	00:11:15	00:11:16	John's a good guy.
191	00:11:16	00:11:19	As a professional courtesy, let's give him access, keep him up to date.
192	00:11:19	00:11:21	Yeah, I'll make sure everybody knows.
193	00:11:21	00:11:22	Thanks.
194	00:11:23	00:11:26	Any luck tracking down Lexi and Cara's cell phones?
195	00:11:26	00:11:29	Thankfully, they're still transmitting.
196	00:11:29	00:11:31	I've triangulated their location to somewhere in North Las Vegas.
197	00:11:31	00:11:33	All right. Can you get any closer?
198	00:11:33	00:11:34	I'm trying.
199	00:11:41	00:11:45	There they are-- off the 215 near Sahara.
200	00:11:45	00:11:46	Signals aren't moving.
201	00:11:46	00:11:47	Could be where the girls are being held.
202	00:11:47	00:11:50	(sighs) Or where their bodies were dumped.
203	00:11:51	00:11:53	I'll call for backup.
204	00:12:12	00:12:13	Big search area.
205	00:12:15	00:12:17	Yeah, but their phones are still transmitting.
206	00:12:17	00:12:19	They should be right around here.
207	00:12:29	00:12:31	I got one.
208	00:12:33	00:12:34	Screen's broken.
209	00:12:37	00:12:38	Here.
210	00:12:42	00:12:44	Their phones were tossed.
211	00:12:45	00:12:47	(sighs) Yeah, but I don't see any bodies.
212	00:12:47	00:12:48	It means the girls could still be alive.
213	00:12:50	00:12:53	It opened up to a video.
214	00:12:53	00:12:55	Looks like it was taken inside a vehicle.
215	00:12:58	00:12:59	Where are you taking us?
216	00:13:01	00:13:03	Please, just let us go.
217	00:13:04	00:13:06	Shut up.
218	00:13:07	00:13:09	My sister's only 13. She's just a kid.
219	00:13:09	00:13:12	You don't need both of us. Just please, let her go!
220	00:13:12	00:13:14	(tires screeching) You stupid bitch!
221	00:13:14	00:13:16	(whimpering) Ooh.
222	00:13:16	00:13:19	Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat.
223	00:13:19	00:13:21	No!
224	00:13:22	00:13:24	Lexi got her captor on camera.
225	00:13:24	00:13:27	Couldn't see much of his face, but no scorpion tattoo.
226	00:13:27	00:13:29	That wasn't Axel Vargas.
227	00:13:29	00:13:32	Then who was it, and what does he want with these girls?
228	00:13:43	00:13:44	Nick!
229	00:13:44	00:13:46	Nick? Just heard the suspect was released.
230	00:13:46	00:13:48	What the hell's going on?
231	00:13:48	00:13:50	Yeah, his alibi checked out.
232	00:13:50	00:13:53	But he was with Lexi and Cara right before they disappeared.
233	00:13:53	00:13:54	He has to be on the top of the suspect list.
234	00:13:54	00:13:58	Yeah, I just saw the video that Lexi shot in the abductor's vehicle.
235	00:13:58	00:14:01	It's not Axel Vargas behind the wheel.
236	00:14:02	00:14:05	Do-do you have any idea who the guy was?
237	00:14:05	00:14:08	Actually, I was hoping you could help us out there, John.
238	00:14:08	00:14:11	You've been running that San Diego office for a long time now.
239	00:14:11	00:14:14	You must have made some enemies along the way?
240	00:14:14	00:14:15	Can you think of anyone who...
241	00:14:15	00:14:19	who might want to snatch up your girls to hurt you in some way?
242	00:14:19	00:14:21	God, I don't know. I...
243	00:14:21	00:14:23	A family member of someone you recently put away.
244	00:14:23	00:14:25	Or someone who was recently released from prison?
245	00:14:25	00:14:27	Something like that?
246	00:14:27	00:14:31	We-we just brought down a biker gang that killed a city supervisor. That's good.
247	00:14:31	00:14:34	Have your lab send that file over right away, and we'll look into it.
248	00:14:34	00:14:36	In the meantime, I want to take a look at that video.
249	00:14:36	00:14:41	(sighs) If this is about me, maybe I'll recognize the guy.
250	00:14:45	00:14:47	Where are you taking us?
251	00:14:47	00:14:49	Please just let us go.
252	00:14:49	00:14:52	My sister's only 13. She's just a kid.
253	00:14:52	00:14:54	You don't need both of us. Just please, let her go!
254	00:14:54	00:14:56	You stupid bitch!
255	00:14:56	00:15:00	Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat.
256	00:15:00	00:15:02	No!
257	00:15:06	00:15:08	I'm sorry you had to see that, John.
258	00:15:08	00:15:11	Do you recognize him?
259	00:15:11	00:15:13	No.
260	00:15:15	00:15:17	What if they're dead already?
261	00:15:19	00:15:22	I mean, he had a knife. He's already killed one person today, right?
262	00:15:22	00:15:25	You shouldn't even be thinking like that.
263	00:15:25	00:15:27	Not when there's a chance they're still alive.
264	00:15:27	00:15:29	We'll work it till we find 'em.
265	00:15:29	00:15:34	It looks like Lexi was trying to send this clip to somebody. She entered this phone number, but it didn't go through.
266	00:15:34	00:15:35	Well, it's a silent call for help.
267	00:15:35	00:15:37	Whose number is that?
268	00:15:37	00:15:38	It's mine.
269	00:15:39	00:15:41	She was trying to send it to me.
270	00:15:41	00:15:44	You weren't in her contact list?
271	00:15:44	00:15:46	I guess not.
272	00:15:46	00:15:52	Lexi and I haven't had much of a relationship since she moved here to live with her mother.
273	00:15:52	00:15:57	Well, you were the first person she thought of to reach out to when she was in trouble.
274	00:15:57	00:16:00	That's got to mean something.
275	00:16:04	00:16:06	Okay, all right, where are we?
276	00:16:06	00:16:10	Did you find out anything about the motorcycle gang that Nolan helped take down?
277	00:16:10	00:16:12	Yeah. Most of them are in prison.
278	00:16:12	00:16:15	San Diego P.D. verified the whereabouts of the others.
279	00:16:15	00:16:18	Is there anyone else who might have had a grudge against Nolan?
280	00:16:18	00:16:24	Well, Nolan's lab just cracked a series of Mexican cartel murders along the border, but he hasn't received any threats lately.
281	00:16:24	00:16:29	No, I think if somebody wanted to get back at him, why would they come all the way here to Vegas?
282	00:16:29	00:16:33	Right. All right, all right, look, maybe this has absolutely nothing to do with him.
283	00:16:33	00:16:39	The guy's got two beautiful daughters, right? They're young, they're attractive, they're in the mall.
284	00:16:39	00:16:41	The mall is like a hunting ground for sexual predators.
285	00:16:41	00:16:44	Maybe this was a... a crime of opportunity.
286	00:16:44	00:16:47	Well, I looked at all the surveillance video from the mall.
287	00:16:47	00:16:54	Cara and Lexi left through the west doors, but they were alone. Okay, but that doesn't mean that the kidnapper wasn't already following them, right?
288	00:16:54	00:16:57	I mean, he could have been laying in wait outside, and then forced them into a car.
289	00:16:57	00:16:58	Hey.
290	00:16:58	00:17:03	I was looking through Lexi's text messages, and I found something interesting.
291	00:17:03	00:17:08	Seems she has an admirer who likes to send her pictures of his... genitals.
292	00:17:09	00:17:11	I'll take your word for it.
293	00:17:11	00:17:13	Well, she told the guy to stop, the images kept coming.
294	00:17:13	00:17:21	When she threatened to share the pics with the cops, the perv wrote back, You bitch, you're just like your mother.
295	00:17:21	00:17:23	He knows Tori Nolan.
296	00:17:23	00:17:24	Did you run the number?
297	00:17:24	00:17:27	Yeah. Came back to a used car salesman named Dennis Hayes.
298	00:17:27	00:17:29	Let's bring him in. Police are trying to track him down.
299	00:17:29	00:17:32	In the meantime, Sara's gonna talk with Tori Nolan.
300	00:17:34	00:17:36	Please, let her go! You stupid bitch!
301	00:17:36	00:17:39	Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat.
302	00:17:39	00:17:40	Lexi!
303	00:17:40	00:17:42	No!
304	00:17:42	00:17:43	Is that Dennis Hayes?
305	00:17:43	00:17:45	I'm not sure.
306	00:17:45	00:17:47	I-I've only met him a couple of times.
307	00:17:47	00:17:49	How do you know him?
308	00:17:49	00:17:52	He was a friend of my ex-boyfriend.
309	00:17:52	00:17:54	Oh, my God. Do you think he did this?
310	00:17:54	00:17:55	Do you think he took my girls?
311	00:17:55	00:17:56	That's what we're trying to figure out.
312	00:17:56	00:18:04	Mrs. Nolan, we found some pretty graphic photos and texts that Dennis sent to Lexi.
313	00:18:04	00:18:06	What was the nature of their relationship?
314	00:18:06	00:18:08	She barely knew him.
315	00:18:08	00:18:10	He came to our house for a party once.
316	00:18:14	00:18:18	Lexi wasn't feeling well, and she went up to bed.
317	00:18:18	00:18:25	I decided to go check on her about a half an hour later, and she was passed out on the bed.
318	00:18:27	00:18:31	And Dennis was on top of her trying to take her clothes off.
319	00:18:31	00:18:35	What did you do? Well, I pulled him off of her, and I told him to get the hell out of my house.
320	00:18:35	00:18:36	You called the police.
321	00:18:39	00:18:41	No, I didn't.
322	00:18:41	00:18:42	Why not?
323	00:18:44	00:18:46	Because we had been drinking.
324	00:18:49	00:18:50	And taking E.
325	00:18:54	00:18:57	Lexi wanted to try it, and...
326	00:18:57	00:18:58	I let her.
327	00:19:00	00:19:03	I didn't want the cops to find out.
328	00:19:03	00:19:05	I didn't want them to take her away from me.
329	00:19:05	00:19:11	You didn't report Dennis Hayes, and now, he may have abducted both of your daughters.
330	00:19:12	00:19:16	Do you have any idea where he could have taken them?
331	00:19:17	00:19:19	I wish I did.
332	00:19:24	00:19:26	What the hell kind of mother are you?
333	00:19:26	00:19:27	Mr. Nolan...
334	00:19:27	00:19:29	You brought that monster into our daughter's life.
335	00:19:29	00:19:31	And now he's taken her and Cara!
336	00:19:31	00:19:34	I didn't know. I should never have let you have custody of Lexi.
337	00:19:34	00:19:35	She didn't want to live with you.
338	00:19:35	00:19:41	Hey, your daughters are missing, and this is not gonna help us find them. Let's just focus on bringing Lexi and Cara home.
339	00:19:41	00:19:43	Please.
340	00:19:48	00:19:49	All right.
341	00:20:00	00:20:02	We still haven't found Hayes.
342	00:20:02	00:20:03	Please, tell me you got something.
343	00:20:03	00:20:05	As a matter of fact, I do.
344	00:20:05	00:20:14	I've been analyzing the video that Lexi took, and from the dashboard, I can tell that the vehicle they were abducted in was a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban.
345	00:20:14	00:20:16	Does Dennis Hayes drive one of those?
346	00:20:16	00:20:18	No, but I mean, he's a used car salesman.
347	00:20:18	00:20:20	He has access to all kinds of vehicles.
348	00:20:20	00:20:25	(phone chimes) All right, I'll call the dealership and, uh, I'll see if they have a '86 Suburban in inventory.
349	00:20:28	00:20:29	What is it?
350	00:20:44	00:20:45	Where is she?
351	00:20:45	00:20:47	In the Dumpster.
352	00:20:48	00:20:55	One of the construction guys accidentally threw out some lighting fixtures, so foreman came back to retrieve 'em, found the body.
353	00:21:16	00:21:18	She one of the girls?
354	00:21:23	00:21:26	Yeah, that's Lexi, the older sister.
355	00:21:26	00:21:29	Not the way we were hoping to find her.
356	00:21:29	00:21:30	No, it's not.
357	00:21:32	00:21:34	Ecchymosis.
358	00:21:34	00:21:37	Means she suffered blunt force trauma to the head.
359	00:21:39	00:21:42	Fresh cuts on the bottoms of her feet.
360	00:21:42	00:21:44	Looks like she tried to run away.
361	00:21:44	00:21:46	Any sign of Cara?
362	00:21:46	00:21:48	She's not in here.
363	00:21:51	00:21:53	Then there's a chance she might still be alive.
364	00:22:27	00:22:29	Hey, I thought Nick was working this one.
365	00:22:29	00:22:31	He's at the morgue.
366	00:22:31	00:22:34	He wanted to be the one to process Lexi's body.
367	00:22:34	00:22:37	I found a necklace.
368	00:22:37	00:22:39	There's not much blood in the dumpster.
369	00:22:39	00:22:41	She was killed somewhere else and dumped here.
370	00:22:41	00:22:43	They said they searched the house under renovation.
371	00:22:43	00:22:44	No sign of Cara.
372	00:22:44	00:22:47	No evidence the girls were ever held there.
373	00:22:47	00:22:49	What about the other houses in the neighborhood?
374	00:22:49	00:22:51	Unis are still canvassing.
375	00:22:51	00:22:56	One neighbor did report hearing a metallic squeaking sound 30.
376	00:22:56	00:22:58	Hinges on the doors of the dumpster, maybe?
377	00:22:58	00:23:02	By the time she looked out the window, all she could see were taillights speeding away.
378	00:23:02	00:23:03	Some type of SUV.
379	00:23:03	00:23:07	But if the killer opened these doors, he would've had to have touched the latch.
380	00:23:07	00:23:09	I'll dust for prints.
381	00:23:38	00:23:39	I don't think you should be in here.
382	00:23:41	00:23:43	I had to see her.
383	00:23:45	00:23:47	I'm really sorry.
384	00:23:50	00:23:52	Her fingernails are broken.
385	00:23:52	00:23:54	She put up a fight.
386	00:23:55	00:23:57	That's Lexi.
387	00:23:57	00:24:00	Strong. Fearless.
388	00:24:00	00:24:03	Yeah, just like her old man.
389	00:24:05	00:24:09	That's probably why we butted heads so much.
390	00:24:09	00:24:14	You know, when she was 12, she wanted to camp out all night for concert tickets and I wouldn't let her.
391	00:24:14	00:24:20	00 in the morning at the venue with her friends.
392	00:24:20	00:24:22	I dragged her home.
393	00:24:24	00:24:26	She didn't talk to me for a week.
394	00:24:30	00:24:31	This is my fault.
395	00:24:31	00:24:37	No. No, it isn't. I should've fought harder to keep her after the divorce.
396	00:24:37	00:24:43	But she was so unhappy. She was acting out, skipping school. I didn't...
397	00:24:43	00:24:47	I didn't know what else to do. Don't put yourself through this, man.
398	00:24:50	00:24:52	What happened to Lexi is not your fault.
399	00:24:55	00:24:57	It's not your fault.
400	00:24:58	00:25:01	You're right. I shouldn't be here.
401	00:25:41	00:25:43	Hey, Nick. Just finishing up here.
402	00:25:52	00:25:54	Damn shame.
403	00:25:55	00:26:01	Nick, sometimes, despite our best efforts, we don't get the result we want.
404	00:26:01	00:26:02	Yeah.
405	00:26:03	00:26:05	You have any news on her sister? No.
406	00:26:05	00:26:08	We're still trying to track down Dennis Hayes.
407	00:26:09	00:26:10	What's her cause of death?
408	00:26:10	00:26:14	She had a significant longitudinal fracture on the back of the head.
409	00:26:14	00:26:17	Crushing blows causing massive cerebral hemorrhaging.
410	00:26:17	00:26:20	And does the injury indicate what type of weapon was used?
411	00:26:20	00:26:23	Her head was smashed into a very hard, flat surface.
412	00:26:23	00:26:27	Okay. I found traces of stone in the wound.
413	00:26:29	00:26:35	And the fingernail scratches around the ligature marks indicates that she tried to get away.
414	00:26:36	00:26:38	Any evidence of sexual assault?
415	00:26:38	00:26:42	No physical findings. She had consensual sex earlier in the day.
416	00:26:42	00:26:45	DNA can sort out any multiple donors.
417	00:26:45	00:26:47	And what is that bite on her shoulder?
418	00:26:47	00:26:49	Is that a sting, some type of insect?
419	00:26:49	00:26:54	Based on the redness and the inflammation, I think you're right.
420	00:26:54	00:26:57	Hey, do you think it could be a scorpion sting?
421	00:26:57	00:27:03	I don't know. Why? I found a piece of exoskeleton on the dead body in the restroom.
422	00:27:03	00:27:05	Same guy Cara Nolan was with.
423	00:27:05	00:27:10	Will you extract some tissue from around the sting and have it analyzed right away? You got it.
424	00:27:12	00:27:13	How's Nolan?
425	00:27:13	00:27:15	He's holding it together as best he can.
426	00:27:15	00:27:20	This is a guy who sees dead bodies in autopsy every day, but when it's your own kid laying there...
427	00:27:20	00:27:23	Oof. I can't even imagine.
428	00:27:24	00:27:26	John's a good guy.
429	00:27:26	00:27:28	He doesn't deserve this.
430	00:27:28	00:27:33	Didn't he send you an autographed Chargers jersey a few years ago?
431	00:27:33	00:27:34	Yeah, Dan Fouts.
432	00:27:34	00:27:40	One of the best passing quarterbacks in the NFL. It was his attempt to lure me to that San Diego office.
433	00:27:40	00:27:44	You ever regret that? Not taking the job out there?
434	00:27:44	00:27:45	No.
435	00:27:45	00:27:48	I mean, it wasn't a promotion or anything like that.
436	00:27:48	00:27:49	Yeah, but the money had to be better than here.
437	00:27:49	00:27:51	Uh, not really.
438	00:27:51	00:27:54	I mean, San Diego's an expensive town to live in.
439	00:27:54	00:27:58	Besides, this is my home. I got all my friends here.
440	00:27:58	00:28:01	This is where my family is.
441	00:28:02	00:28:06	And look, the Chargers got a good football team, but they're no Dallas Cowboys.
442	00:28:06	00:28:07	Those are my boys.
443	00:28:07	00:28:09	Go Cowboys.
444	00:28:10	00:28:12	Hey, Russell. Mm.
445	00:28:12	00:28:19	Doc confirmed that the sting on Lexi Nolan's shoulder was from a scorpion. Same type as the exoskeleton that Nick found? No.
446	00:28:19	00:28:21	This wasn't a giant hairy scorpion.
447	00:28:21	00:28:29	The histopath report identified chlorotoxin and maurotoxin, consistent with a deathstalker scorpion.
448	00:28:30	00:28:32	They common to Nevada?
449	00:28:32	00:28:34	Indigenous to Israel.
450	00:28:34	00:28:36	Well then how is she stung by one of these?
451	00:28:36	00:28:38	It had to be intentional.
452	00:28:38	00:28:42	Some people keep them as pets, which is crazy-- deathstalkers are highly aggressive.
453	00:28:43	00:28:53	When they sting their victims, the venom rushes into the bloodstream, causing increased heartbeat, blood pressure, and, if enough venom is released, convulsions and death.
454	00:28:53	00:29:01	Well, now, Doc said that Lexi Nolan died from blunt force trauma, right? Yes, but I think the scorpion sting may have contributed to her death.
455	00:29:01	00:29:08	See, Lexi had cuts on the bottom of her feet. If she tried to run, with that venom in her system, she wouldn't have gotten very far.
456	00:29:08	00:29:10	Allowing her killer to catch up.
457	00:29:11	00:29:14	So do we know if Dennis Hayes has a thing for scorpions?
458	00:29:14	00:29:16	He's not our guy.
459	00:29:16	00:29:19	Police tracked him down to a motel in Nebraska.
460	00:29:19	00:29:20	He's been there three days.
461	00:29:20	00:29:26	So we know that whoever killed Lexi Nolan had access to a deathstalker scorpion.
462	00:29:26	00:29:30	And if they're not native to Nevada, then where'd the guy get one?
463	00:29:31	00:29:36	Hey, turns out there are seven places in Nevada that sell deathstalker scorpions.
464	00:29:36	00:29:38	Seven places too many, if you ask me.
465	00:29:38	00:29:41	I guess some people get a kick out of owning something that can kill you.
466	00:29:41	00:29:49	Deathstalkers only live two to six years, so I got a list of everyone who purchased one from 2008 to now.
467	00:29:50	00:29:56	We cross-reference this with everyone who drives a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban, and we might get our guy.
468	00:29:56	00:29:59	Great minds think alike.
469	00:30:04	00:30:09	Here-- Kieran Clark. 528 Cactus Ridge Lane.
470	00:30:31	00:30:32	LVPD.
471	00:30:33	00:30:35	Kieran Clark, LVPD.
472	00:30:36	00:30:38	Clear inside.
473	00:30:41	00:30:43	All clear.
474	00:30:43	00:30:44	Nobody's here.
475	00:30:45	00:30:48	That means no Cara.
476	00:30:53	00:30:57	This is Clark's address, but it doesn't look like he lives here.
477	00:30:59	00:31:02	Terrariums.
478	00:31:02	00:31:04	A lot of them.
479	00:31:16	00:31:18	Oh! Oh, God.
480	00:31:21	00:31:24	Guess he's not just into scorpions.
481	00:31:30	00:31:32	Hey, Morgan.
482	00:31:33	00:31:34	Check this out.
483	00:31:34	00:31:36	Stalker photos.
484	00:31:36	00:31:38	Cara Nolan was only in town for the past few days.
485	00:31:38	00:31:41	What, has he been stalking her the whole time?
486	00:31:47	00:31:48	Wait a minute.
487	00:31:48	00:31:50	That's somebody else.
488	00:31:50	00:31:52	That's not Cara Nolan.
489	00:31:52	00:31:53	Who is it, then?
490	00:31:53	00:31:55	Another victim? I don't know.
491	00:31:55	00:31:58	But whoever she is...
492	00:31:58	00:32:00	she's a dead ringer for Cara.
493	00:32:26	00:32:28	I already heard.
494	00:32:29	00:32:31	You didn't find Cara.
495	00:32:31	00:32:32	No. Not yet.
496	00:32:32	00:32:36	But we know who took her and we know why.
497	00:32:36	00:32:37	A guy named Kieran Clark.
498	00:32:37	00:32:40	There was a-a shrine in that barn.
499	00:32:40	00:32:43	It seems as though the suspect has an obsession with a young woman.
500	00:32:43	00:32:47	We haven't identified her yet, but she looks just like Cara.
501	00:32:47	00:32:52	He took my two girls because Cara reminded him of someone?
502	00:32:52	00:32:54	That's what it looks like, yeah.
503	00:32:54	00:32:56	But... only a matter of time...
504	00:32:56	00:32:57	Before we get Cara back.
505	00:32:57	00:32:59	Is that what you're gonna try and sell me?
506	00:32:59	00:33:04	John, I'm not trying to sell you on-on anything here, but I'm sure as hell not ready to quit.
507	00:33:04	00:33:06	We're gonna find her.
508	00:33:06	00:33:09	No doubt we will.
509	00:33:10	00:33:12	Just like we found...
510	00:33:12	00:33:13	Lexi.
511	00:33:17	00:33:21	I'm sorry about Lexi.
512	00:33:21	00:33:25	But hey, you can't just fold and throw in now. Come on.
513	00:33:25	00:33:28	I'm no tourist, Nick.
514	00:33:28	00:33:30	I've run a crime lab for 17 years.
515	00:33:30	00:33:36	Cara's been missing for 24 hours, and that lunatic already killed Lexi.
516	00:33:38	00:33:42	You and I both know how this thing's probably gonna end.
517	00:33:43	00:33:45	I'm not about to quit.
518	00:33:45	00:33:47	And you're not, either.
519	00:33:47	00:33:50	(sighs) You hear me?
520	00:33:50	00:33:52	Hey, look at me.
521	00:33:53	00:33:57	I will find her.
522	00:33:57	00:33:59	Okay, what do we know about Kieran Clark?
523	00:33:59	00:34:01	He's known as the Bug Guy.
524	00:34:01	00:34:06	He goes around to schools and kids' birthday parties, educating them about insects and reptiles.
525	00:34:06	00:34:08	It's terrifying that he works around children.
526	00:34:08	00:34:12	And the young woman in these photos, the one he's obviously obsessed with?
527	00:34:12	00:34:15	According to the police report, her name is Jennifer DeMarcus.
528	00:34:15	00:34:16	She used to work at a pet shop in Henderson.
529	00:34:16	00:34:17	That's where they met.
530	00:34:17	00:34:22	She had one date with Clark before she realized he was a head case, and then she told him that she wasn't interested.
531	00:34:22	00:34:24	Let me guess-- he wouldn't take no for an answer.
532	00:34:24	00:34:29	He kept coming around the pet shop, and then he started parking his car in front of Jennifer's apartment at night.
533	00:34:29	00:34:31	She called the police on him several times.
534	00:34:31	00:34:33	Did she get a restraining order?
535	00:34:33	00:34:35	Left town. Moved back to Georgia.
536	00:34:35	00:34:37	Put as much distance between her and Clark as she could.
537	00:34:37	00:34:39	Clearly, he's still obsessed with her.
538	00:34:39	00:34:41	So, what do you think?
539	00:34:41	00:34:47	Kieran goes to the mall, sees Cara looking very much like Jennifer, and he decides to grab her.
540	00:34:47	00:34:51	Except Cara was with Pete Corday, so Clark had to get rid of him first.
541	00:34:58	00:35:04	And by the time he was done with Pete, Cara was with Lexi, so he had to take them both. Right.
542	00:35:04	00:35:08	The stone particles that Nick found in Lexi Nolan's head wound were coated.
543	00:35:08	00:35:14	I identified a mixture of ethanol, alkylalkoxysilane and isopropyl acetate.
544	00:35:14	00:35:15	Oxysilane?
545	00:35:15	00:35:18	That sounds like a sealant of some kind.
546	00:35:18	00:35:25	Actually, it's an impregnating sealant, used to protect concrete from water and staining-- uh, primarily walkways, driveways.
547	00:35:25	00:35:32	There was no evidence of sealant in the Dumpster where Lexi's body was found, which means it had to come from where she was actually murdered.
548	00:35:33	00:35:35	Lexi tried to escape.
549	00:35:35	00:35:39	She was still feeling distress from the scorpion sting.
550	00:35:39	00:35:45	Maybe she was near a driveway when Kieran Clark caught up to her and smashed her head into it.
551	00:35:49	00:35:56	The sealant in Lexi's wound wasn't entirely cured, meaning that it was probably applied within the last couple of days.
552	00:35:56	00:35:57	Okay. All right.
553	00:35:57	00:36:01	Let's do a search within a five-mile radius of where Lexi's body was found.
554	00:36:01	00:36:05	We're looking for somebody who recently had their concrete driveway sealed.
555	00:36:10	00:36:11	Hey. Hey.
556	00:36:11	00:36:12	I heard you got something.
557	00:36:12	00:36:14	Yeah. Lexi's body was found right here.
558	00:36:16	00:36:21	Two miles away, on Harvard Drive, this house had their driveway sealed on Wednesday.
559	00:36:21	00:36:26	Now, we know that when Lexi ran she didn't get very far, so Clark's got to be holding Cara somewhere nearby.
560	00:36:26	00:36:28	I should get out there.
561	00:36:28	00:36:29	Wait for backup.
562	00:36:29	00:36:31	I will.
563	00:37:10	00:37:11	LVPD!
564	00:37:11	00:37:12	Get over here.
565	00:37:12	00:37:14	Kieran Clark!
566	00:37:14	00:37:16	No! Let me go!
567	00:37:18	00:37:19	Drop the knife.
568	00:37:19	00:37:21	Don't come any closer.
569	00:37:22	00:37:23	Put the knife down.
570	00:37:25	00:37:27	I'll slit her throat.
571	00:37:27	00:37:30	Hey, me and you, we can work this out.
572	00:37:30	00:37:32	But you don't need to hurt her.
573	00:37:32	00:37:35	What I need is for you to leave.
574	00:37:35	00:37:37	Now, we both know that's not going to happen.
575	00:37:37	00:37:39	Go!
576	00:37:40	00:37:41	I will kill her.
577	00:37:45	00:37:47	I know about the girl from the pet store.
578	00:37:47	00:37:48	Jennifer-- I mean, isn't that the girl you liked?
579	00:37:48	00:37:50	I love her. Okay.
580	00:37:50	00:37:52	All right.
581	00:37:52	00:37:54	But she's not her.
582	00:37:54	00:37:57	Her name is Cara Nolan. She's 13 years old.
583	00:37:57	00:37:58	She's never done anything to hurt you.
584	00:37:58	00:38:01	I know...
585	00:38:01	00:38:03	when you saw her at the mall, you thought...
586	00:38:03	00:38:04	That's Jennifer.
587	00:38:06	00:38:08	But take a closer look.
588	00:38:09	00:38:10	It's not her.
589	00:38:10	00:38:12	She's a child, and she...
590	00:38:12	00:38:13	she needs to go home.
591	00:38:16	00:38:18	You're wrong.
592	00:38:18	00:38:19	She's mine.
593	00:38:21	00:38:24	Let her go. I can't let you take her.
594	00:38:32	00:38:34	It's okay.
595	00:38:34	00:38:36	It's all right. I'm a friend of your dad's.
596	00:38:36	00:38:38	Thank you.
597	00:38:42	00:38:44	It's gonna be all right.
598	00:39:12	00:39:14	How's she doing?
599	00:39:14	00:39:16	Physically, she's okay.
600	00:39:16	00:39:18	She's been through a hell of an ordeal, but...
601	00:39:19	00:39:21	...she's alive because of you.
602	00:39:21	00:39:23	You never gave up.
603	00:39:24	00:39:27	Thank you for bringing her back to me.
604	00:39:27	00:39:28	You're welcome.
605	00:39:30	00:39:32	You know, Nick...
606	00:39:32	00:39:36	I've been thinking about the choices I've made.
607	00:39:36	00:39:38	Working weekends and evenings.
608	00:39:38	00:39:41	Missing school plays, soccer games.
609	00:39:41	00:39:43	Sometimes going days without seeing my girls.
610	00:39:43	00:39:46	For years, I've been putting other people's families ahead of my own.
611	00:39:46	00:39:47	I don't want to do that anymore.
612	00:39:49	00:39:50	So, what are you saying? You're gonna hang it up?
613	00:39:50	00:39:53	Well, Cara needs me.
614	00:39:53	00:39:55	Now more than ever.
615	00:39:55	00:39:57	It would be a big loss for your crime lab.
616	00:39:58	00:40:00	Not with you there.
617	00:40:00	00:40:03	John, we've talked about this. I've already got a job.
618	00:40:03	00:40:05	I'm not asking you to just join the team.
619	00:40:05	00:40:07	I'm asking you to run it.
620	00:40:09	00:40:12	You want me to take over the crime lab in San Diego?
621	00:40:12	00:40:15	I know it would be in good hands with you at the helm.
622	00:40:20	00:40:21	That's a big job.
623	00:40:21	00:40:25	You don't have to answer me right now.
624	00:40:25	00:40:27	Just promise me... you'll think about it.
625	00:40:33	00:40:34	Thank you, Nick.
