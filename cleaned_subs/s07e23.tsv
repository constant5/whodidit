0	00:00:35	00:00:36	You're late.
1	00:00:46	00:00:47	Now say it.
2	00:00:51	00:00:55	I said... say it.
3	00:00:55	00:00:57	You have to say it.
4	00:00:57	00:00:59	Say it.
5	00:01:04	00:01:06	Is she going to be okay?
6	00:01:06	00:01:08	Yes, ma'am, she's stable.
7	00:01:08	00:01:09	Severe trauma to the neck.
8	00:01:09	00:01:11	Heather, I'm Catherine Willows.
9	00:01:11	00:01:12	I don't know if you remember me.
10	00:01:14	00:01:15	It's going to be all right.
11	00:01:21	00:01:23	Like a bad penny, some people just keep showing up.
12	00:01:23	00:01:25	Did you call Grissom?
13	00:01:29	00:01:30	Who found her?
14	00:01:30	00:01:32	Guy over there in the ten gallon-- Vernon Porter.
15	00:01:32	00:01:34	He's a night watchman.
16	00:01:34	00:01:37	All the employees are required to wear that cowboy getup.
17	00:01:37	00:01:41	That's the job that cops get after they retire.
18	00:01:41	00:01:43	You've got something to look forward to, Jim.
19	00:01:43	00:01:47	(piano playing jaunty tune) Yes, ma'am.
20	00:01:47	00:01:50	Chewing tobacco. Looks fresh.
21	00:02:03	00:02:06	Lady Heather has a house for this.
22	00:02:06	00:02:09	Why take her show on the road?
23	00:02:09	00:02:12	Do you think you know how to...? Yeah.
24	00:02:16	00:02:19	Oh, you're a genius.
25	00:02:19	00:02:21	Well, this is where we found her.
26	00:02:21	00:02:22	Did she have ligature marks?
27	00:02:22	00:02:24	On her neck, yeah.
28	00:02:24	00:02:26	Well, that doesn't make any sense.
29	00:02:26	00:02:27	She was a dominatrix.
30	00:02:27	00:02:30	Not a submissive.
31	00:02:30	00:02:32	Maybe the party just got out of control.
32	00:02:32	00:02:36	Or somebody didn't know the rules.
33	00:03:08	00:03:10	How you doing?
34	00:03:10	00:03:12	These files are out of control.
35	00:03:13	00:03:18	Typos, white-outs, names missing, whole sections missing. 20 years ago, the county was still using typewriters.
36	00:03:18	00:03:19	Did you find anything?
37	00:03:19	00:03:21	Ernie Dell's foster child.
38	00:03:21	00:03:22	Donna Catalani.
39	00:03:22	00:03:25	Lived with the Dells for a year.
40	00:03:25	00:03:27	Her CASA report came with a supplemental.
41	00:03:27	00:03:28	They forgot to black out her social security number.
42	00:03:28	00:03:32	We can use that to track her down, unless the adoptives changed it.
43	00:03:33	00:03:34	Good. I'll run it.
44	00:03:34	00:03:35	I have to pull you off of this.
45	00:03:35	00:03:37	Days is down to four CSIs.
46	00:03:37	00:03:38	You're on loan-out.
47	00:03:38	00:03:40	Why can't Days keep anybody?
48	00:03:40	00:03:42	Money, stress, Ecklie, maybe.
49	00:03:43	00:03:45	Just help them with their backlog.
50	00:03:48	00:03:50	So you're sure that the gate was locked?
51	00:03:50	00:03:52	00 when Oakley's closes.
52	00:03:52	00:03:55	The first thing I do is lock the gate.
53	00:03:55	00:03:58	Make my rounds every two hours.
54	00:03:58	00:04:03	00, 10 everything was Code 4.
55	00:04:03	00:04:04	When did things go Code 3?
56	00:04:05	00:04:08	Found the main gate unlocked at 0214.
57	00:04:08	00:04:10	Went to check out the street, heard that music.
58	00:04:10	00:04:14	Found her on the floor, called it in.
59	00:04:14	00:04:17	This is a family theme park.
60	00:04:17	00:04:20	I'm assuming they don't actually serve alcohol here.
61	00:04:20	00:04:23	Must have brought their own.
62	00:04:23	00:04:26	Single malt, 30 years old.
63	00:04:26	00:04:27	S &amp; M is a rich man's sport.
64	00:04:27	00:04:30	Kind of like hockey-- a lot of equipment.
65	00:04:30	00:04:32	How much do you think a night like this would cost?
66	00:04:32	00:04:37	Heather told me, five years ago, she was clearing 20 grand a week.
67	00:04:37	00:04:40	And that was before ladyheather.com.
68	00:04:42	00:04:44	What is she like?
69	00:04:44	00:04:47	Beautiful...
70	00:04:47	00:04:49	smart, intense...
71	00:04:49	00:04:52	charming.
72	00:04:52	00:04:54	The only woman I've ever seen rattle Grissom.
73	00:04:54	00:05:00	I mean, he kind of liked that forensic anthropologist, Terry Miller.
74	00:05:00	00:05:01	Remember her?
75	00:05:01	00:05:03	Yeah.
76	00:05:03	00:05:07	But she wasn't enough of a challenge for him.
77	00:05:07	00:05:10	Heather, on the other hand...
78	00:05:10	00:05:15	uninhibited and can beat him at mental chess.
79	00:05:17	00:05:19	They had chemistry.
80	00:05:19	00:05:21	And he is a scientist.
81	00:05:21	00:05:27	I have no proof and I know he'd never tell me, but I'm certain they spent the night together.
82	00:05:27	00:05:30	Wonder which one wore the chaps.
83	00:05:30	00:05:32	Lots of... (clears throat) ...coins and toothpicks.
84	00:05:32	00:05:34	They don't sweep under here.
85	00:05:34	00:05:41	I mean, more power to him, really, to find somebody outside of work 'cause you start fishing from the company pier, and...
86	00:05:41	00:05:43	asking for trouble.
87	00:05:43	00:05:46	I got a shot glass.
88	00:05:46	00:05:49	Looks like there's some lipstick around the rim.
89	00:05:49	00:05:52	My fantasy does not include costumes, or pain...
90	00:05:52	00:05:55	and certainly not sawdust.
91	00:05:57	00:05:59	You?
92	00:06:01	00:06:03	Patrol found her.
93	00:06:03	00:06:05	Any witnesses?
94	00:06:05	00:06:09	No. No businesses open, no cars on the side streets.
95	00:06:09	00:06:11	So how'd she get here?
96	00:06:11	00:06:15	Well, in this neighborhood, unless she's a hooker, I doubt she walked.
97	00:06:15	00:06:20	I'm going to go make some calls, see if any of these places have any security cameras.
98	00:06:20	00:06:22	Thanks.
99	00:06:22	00:06:25	That's a pretty nasty head wound.
100	00:06:25	00:06:26	Where's Super Dave?
101	00:06:27	00:06:29	He's probably at the 420 on Flamingo.
102	00:06:29	00:06:31	They left their purse.
103	00:06:32	00:06:34	Oh!
104	00:06:34	00:06:35	The thing is heavier than my kid.
105	00:06:35	00:06:37	Ever get hit in the head with one of these?
106	00:06:38	00:06:41	No. Gentlemen don't get hit in the head with those.
107	00:06:41	00:06:42	Gentlemen...
108	00:06:46	00:06:48	Keysha Sayrun?
109	00:06:49	00:06:50	Well, that's not her.
110	00:06:50	00:06:52	Maybe it's not her purse.
111	00:06:52	00:06:54	There's a whole bunch of wallets in here.
112	00:06:54	00:06:57	Driver's permit.
113	00:06:57	00:07:00	Kid's only 15-- has got a credit card?
114	00:07:00	00:07:02	She's got to be a pickpocket.
115	00:07:02	00:07:04	Aw, man, that's a shame.
116	00:07:04	00:07:05	Look at her.
117	00:07:05	00:07:07	She could be anything she wanted to be.
118	00:07:07	00:07:09	Makes you wonder what happens to people.
119	00:07:09	00:07:11	I got her.
120	00:07:11	00:07:12	Faith Maroney.
121	00:07:13	00:07:15	Twenty-five...
122	00:07:15	00:07:17	from Southern Highlands.
123	00:07:17	00:07:22	Sometimes I miss the days when I didn't take this job so personally, Warrick.
124	00:07:22	00:07:26	Yeah? Well, I miss the days when we only had five homicides a week.
125	00:07:42	00:07:43	Grissom.
126	00:07:44	00:07:46	Catherine.
127	00:07:46	00:07:48	I'm on my way.
128	00:07:51	00:07:54	I was planning an Old West party.
129	00:07:54	00:07:57	I was checking out the facilities.
130	00:07:57	00:07:59	So why couldn't you check them out during normal business hours?
131	00:07:59	00:08:00	It was my normal business hours.
132	00:08:00	00:08:02	You know, we spoke to the night watchman.
133	00:08:02	00:08:05	He said the gate was locked. How did you get in?
134	00:08:05	00:08:06	I know the owner.
135	00:08:06	00:08:08	Do you know him the way you know Judge Fincher?
136	00:08:08	00:08:10	Because I know that's how you got out of jail last time.
137	00:08:11	00:08:12	I need a name.
138	00:08:12	00:08:13	Mr. Oakley.
139	00:08:13	00:08:15	I have his number, but not on me.
140	00:08:15	00:08:17	You'll have to look it up. (knocking)
141	00:08:17	00:08:19	Hi.
142	00:08:19	00:08:20	I'm with the crime lab.
143	00:08:20	00:08:21	Sara Sidle.
144	00:08:22	00:08:26	I'm here to collect your clothes and trace evidence from your body.
145	00:08:26	00:08:28	Can I say no?
146	00:08:28	00:08:30	Why would you want to?
147	00:08:30	00:08:33	Did the nurse forget to collect an SAE kit?
148	00:08:33	00:08:35	Not necessary.
149	00:08:35	00:08:37	You don't want help, that's okay by me.
150	00:08:37	00:08:39	Just don't waste my time.
151	00:08:39	00:08:41	I've got a lot of cases on my desk that need my attention.
152	00:08:42	00:08:45	So when you come out of your haze, give me a call.
153	00:08:52	00:08:57	I don't respond well to men who judge me based solely on my profession.
154	00:08:57	00:08:59	I get that a lot, too.
155	00:08:59	00:09:00	Law enforcement.
156	00:09:05	00:09:07	May I move your hair?
157	00:09:22	00:09:24	These look like rope marks on your neck.
158	00:09:26	00:09:28	Grissom.
159	00:09:33	00:09:35	I'll be done in a minute.
160	00:09:41	00:09:43	What's the matter, Doc, you been hitting it a little too hard?
161	00:09:43	00:09:45	No, canine-induced insomnia.
162	00:09:46	00:09:48	We're fostering some puppies-- Jack Russells.
163	00:09:48	00:09:49	Had me up all night.
164	00:09:50	00:09:51	How about a puppy to keep you company?
165	00:09:51	00:09:54	No, if I stay up all night, it's not going to be because of a puppy.
166	00:09:54	00:09:56	C.O.D.?
167	00:09:56	00:10:01	Okay, blunt force trauma to the left temporal region of the skull.
168	00:10:01	00:10:03	The skull's fractured.
169	00:10:03	00:10:05	Any idea what kind of weapon might have been used?
170	00:10:05	00:10:08	No, but I found these imbedded in the skull.
171	00:10:12	00:10:13	Paint chips?
172	00:10:13	00:10:16	Could she have been hit by a car? Well, it's possible.
173	00:10:16	00:10:21	But if she was standing when she was hit, I'd expect to find pedestrian fractures on her legs.
174	00:10:21	00:10:24	And there are no run-over marks, so she wasn't in a prone position.
175	00:10:24	00:10:27	So if she wasn't standing or lying down...
176	00:10:27	00:10:30	She was somewhere in-between.
177	00:10:31	00:10:33	Stokes, you ready for a cup of coffee?
178	00:10:33	00:10:38	No, thanks. I'm only going to be about another ten minutes here, okay?
179	00:10:38	00:10:39	Your call.
180	00:10:51	00:10:54	Hey.
181	00:10:54	00:10:56	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
182	00:10:56	00:10:58	You all right, man?
183	00:10:58	00:11:00	You all right?
184	00:11:08	00:11:12	Are you here in a professional capacity?
185	00:11:12	00:11:15	Does it make a difference?
186	00:11:15	00:11:17	Maybe not to you.
187	00:11:17	00:11:19	I feel exposed.
188	00:11:19	00:11:21	The last time you saw me...
189	00:11:21	00:11:23	You had just lost your daughter.
190	00:11:23	00:11:26	That's not all I lost that night.
191	00:11:29	00:11:31	Heather!
192	00:11:31	00:11:39	If a client did this, and left you to die, why are you protecting him?
193	00:11:39	00:11:40	I'm not.
194	00:11:40	00:11:42	Tell me the truth.
195	00:11:46	00:11:48	Did they check your glucose level when you came in?
196	00:11:48	00:11:52	Heather?
197	00:11:53	00:11:56	She's diabetic. I think she's going into shock.
198	00:11:56	00:11:58	The patient never told us.
199	00:12:01	00:12:06	Captain, I'll need a copy of the police report for my insurance.
200	00:12:06	00:12:08	Oh, sure, sure, sure. We'll get to that.
201	00:12:08	00:12:17	But, first, I need to straighten out a few things. Mr. Oakley, did you give Heather Kessler permission to enter the park after hours?
202	00:12:17	00:12:19	No, I didn't. I did.
203	00:12:19	00:12:22	She called the office. Wanted to know about renting out Oakley's Saloon for a private party.
204	00:12:22	00:12:24	Well, you know what she does for a living, right?
205	00:12:25	00:12:27	Money's money-- doesn't matter who's handing it to you, right, Dad?
206	00:12:27	00:12:29	As long as you're not breaking the law.
207	00:12:29	00:12:33	So you have no problem with a dominatrix doing business at a family theme park?
208	00:12:33	00:12:37	Captain, sometimes, my son, he... he doesn't think things all the way through.
209	00:12:37	00:12:39	But I'm learning.
210	00:12:39	00:12:41	So how did she get in?
211	00:12:41	00:12:43	I swung by. Wanted to meet her.
212	00:12:43	00:12:45	After midnight? Yeah.
213	00:12:45	00:12:47	Told her to lock up when she was done.
214	00:12:47	00:12:48	You should have stayed, Ben.
215	00:12:48	00:12:49	You got liability to think about.
216	00:12:50	00:12:52	Right, Dad. 'Cause you always do.
217	00:12:55	00:12:58	Captain, is this about it?
218	00:12:58	00:13:00	Well, I'd like to talk to Benny a little more.
219	00:13:00	00:13:02	We need to confirm his statement.
220	00:13:59	00:14:06	There were no security cameras at the crime scene, but Ms. Maroney had multiple arrests for petty theft and shoplifting.
221	00:14:06	00:14:11	She had just been released on court-ordered rehab for kleptomania.
222	00:14:11	00:14:16	She got noodles, hairpins, dish towels, a can of tuna.
223	00:14:16	00:14:18	She didn't care what she took.
224	00:14:18	00:14:19	She just had to take it.
225	00:14:20	00:14:21	You know, I was thinking.
226	00:14:21	00:14:25	If she pinched my wallet, and I whacked her for it, I'd probably get back my wallet before I split.
227	00:14:25	00:14:28	Which means the theft victims are probably not the suspects.
228	00:14:29	00:14:30	Got anything else?
229	00:14:30	00:14:41	A couple of loose receipts, all from last night, all paid in cash. A pack of gum from the Bargain Bin, a soda from Carlisa's, and a Bloody Mary from Diane's Steakhouse.
230	00:14:41	00:14:44	Which is less than quarter of a mile from the crime scene.
231	00:14:44	00:14:47	52 p.m.
232	00:14:47	00:14:48	00.
233	00:14:49	00:14:50	I'll start at the steakhouse and backtrack.
234	00:15:17	00:15:19	Hey. Hey.
235	00:15:19	00:15:21	What? Have you been shaving with a broken beer bottle?
236	00:15:21	00:15:26	No, no. Some drunk driver ran into a radio car at my crime scene. Friggin' idiot.
237	00:15:26	00:15:30	Yeah. I heard you pulled the friggin' idiot's friend out of a burning car.
238	00:15:30	00:15:31	Nothing was on fire.
239	00:15:31	00:15:32	I didn't pull anybody from anywhere.
240	00:15:32	00:15:34	Oh, so humble.
241	00:15:34	00:15:36	You know, some people are just destined for greatness.
242	00:15:36	00:15:41	Run these against the paint chips from the body, please.
243	00:15:41	00:15:47	Sure. You mean the engine black over canary yellow paint chips from a Ford automobile? Yeah.
244	00:15:47	00:15:49	If I had a yellow car, I'd paint over it, too.
245	00:15:49	00:15:52	So the victim was hit by a car.
246	00:15:55	00:15:57	Steakhouse called Faith Maroney a cab.
247	00:15:58	00:16:00	They have a direct line to this place.
248	00:16:00	00:16:02	Well, the car that hit her was yellow and black.
249	00:16:02	00:16:06	Paint color's not going to help us narrow it down any, is it? No.
250	00:16:06	00:16:07	You guys from Strip-O-Gram?
251	00:16:07	00:16:09	Excuse me?
252	00:16:09	00:16:18	'Cause last year, for my birthday, a cop showed up with a phony badge, started tearing his clothes off and trying to rub up on me.
253	00:16:18	00:16:20	I'm an excellent tipper.
254	00:16:20	00:16:23	Well, I'm sure you are, but, uh, no, ma'am, we're not dancers.
255	00:16:23	00:16:24	We're here about the warrant.
256	00:16:24	00:16:27	Okay, then.
257	00:16:27	00:16:30	So we dispatched 20 cabs to Diane's Steakhouse last night.
258	00:16:30	00:16:31	00?
259	00:16:31	00:16:33	01.
260	00:16:33	00:16:35	Dispatched number 29.
261	00:16:35	00:16:36	Chandru Kambhatla.
262	00:16:37	00:16:38	00.
263	00:16:38	00:16:41	Well, we're going to need to see that cab and your trip sheet.
264	00:16:41	00:16:43	Number 29's right there.
265	00:16:43	00:16:45	Keys are inside.
266	00:16:45	00:16:50	No joy riding, and don't leave the doors off like you did last time.
267	00:16:50	00:16:52	Hey, we just take them apart.
268	00:16:52	00:16:53	We don't put them back together, now.
269	00:16:53	00:16:56	That's why nobody likes to deal with your asses!
270	00:17:02	00:17:04	Hey, Nick, there's a camera in here.
271	00:17:05	00:17:08	Maybe that'll be able to tell us if Princess Pickpocket was one of his fares.
272	00:17:13	00:17:16	Front bumper screens positive for blood.
273	00:17:16	00:17:18	Hey.
274	00:17:18	00:17:22	I got robbed last week, filed a report.
275	00:17:22	00:17:24	How come you're helping Chandru and not me?
276	00:17:24	00:17:26	This isn't a robbery, sir.
277	00:17:26	00:17:27	Then, what is it?
278	00:17:27	00:17:28	Do you know the guy that drives this cab?
279	00:17:29	00:17:30	Sure.
280	00:17:30	00:17:31	You see him last night? I had to cut out early.
281	00:17:32	00:17:33	My wife's sick.
282	00:17:33	00:17:34	But, uh, Dru's solid.
283	00:17:34	00:17:37	Got to respect a guy who comes here and wants to be legit.
284	00:17:37	00:17:41	Goes to work, pays his taxes, studying to be a citizen.
285	00:17:41	00:17:43	If you want to know about state capitals, you just ask Dru.
286	00:17:43	00:17:47	Did you know that Vegas is not the capital of Nevada?
287	00:17:47	00:17:49	Thanks for the info, fellas.
288	00:17:49	00:17:51	Go get 'em.
289	00:18:04	00:18:07	The substance that I found under the saloon window was chewing tobacco.
290	00:18:08	00:18:08	The night watchman chews.
291	00:18:09	00:18:10	Yeah, Vernon Porter.
292	00:18:10	00:18:12	He was fired from the force back in Chicago.
293	00:18:12	00:18:13	Yeah, I know, I checked him out. Oh.
294	00:18:13	00:18:15	He got in an off-duty incident.
295	00:18:15	00:18:19	He was in a fight in a bar and a woman was hospitalized.
296	00:18:19	00:18:20	I'm thinking he had a front row seat.
297	00:18:20	00:18:23	Well, you know, it fits his profile.
298	00:18:23	00:18:26	He could have waited till Heather's client left-- there's always a client... Yeah.
299	00:18:26	00:18:28	...and then attacked her.
300	00:18:28	00:18:31	You know, I should have checked to see if he was wearing underwear.
301	00:18:31	00:18:33	There's no way that he could afford her.
302	00:18:33	00:18:35	So why would Heather cover for him?
303	00:18:35	00:18:37	Unless he's just a witness.
304	00:18:37	00:18:41	Well, you want to see a man about a horse?
305	00:18:44	00:18:46	Any results on Heather Kessler?
306	00:18:46	00:18:48	So far, all the prints come back to her.
307	00:18:48	00:18:51	Player piano, whiskey bottle, shot glass.
308	00:18:51	00:18:54	There was some lipstick around the rim.
309	00:18:54	00:18:56	I haven't had a chance to test it.
310	00:18:56	00:18:58	You think it's her shade?
311	00:18:58	00:19:06	Heather's not supposed to drink because of her diabetes, which could explain the hypoglycemia and shock.
312	00:19:06	00:19:10	Catherine found a pair of men's underwear in the toilet.
313	00:19:10	00:19:18	Any evidence on them would have been washed away, but she also found seminal fluid in a tissue on the floor nearby.
314	00:19:18	00:19:19	She was sexually assaulted?
315	00:19:20	00:19:22	She refused an SAE kit, so we'll never know.
316	00:19:22	00:19:27	There were no defensive wounds, no skin or rope fibers under her nails.
317	00:19:27	00:19:33	At first blush, I figured he might have ambushed her, except that I noted three separate strangulation attempts on her neck.
318	00:19:36	00:19:38	She had time to fight back.
319	00:19:38	00:19:40	This makes no sense.
320	00:19:40	00:19:41	She's very strong.
321	00:19:41	00:19:44	And tough as nails.
322	00:19:44	00:19:46	Why didn't she fight?
323	00:19:47	00:19:49	Gate's unlocked again.
324	00:19:49	00:19:51	Well, it's ten after.
325	00:19:51	00:19:53	Probably unlocked 'cause he's doing his rounds.
326	00:19:53	00:19:54	Maybe.
327	00:19:54	00:19:55	Ah, the Wild West, partner.
328	00:19:55	00:19:57	Okay, come on, Jim, give it up.
329	00:19:57	00:20:00	I know you know something about Grissom and Lady Heather.
330	00:20:00	00:20:03	I know something a lot juicier than Grissom and Lady He...
331	00:20:14	00:20:16	Oh, yeah, he's dead.
332	00:20:16	00:20:18	He took one in the back.
333	00:20:18	00:20:21	Who shot the sheriff?
334	00:20:26	00:20:29	Bullet entered through his back.
335	00:20:31	00:20:33	No exit wound.
336	00:20:34	00:20:36	There's some swelling under his lip.
337	00:20:37	00:20:39	Ugh, disgusting.
338	00:20:39	00:20:41	You get mouth cancer from this.
339	00:20:41	00:20:42	David, hand me his cell phone.
340	00:20:43	00:20:45	Sure.
341	00:20:45	00:20:47	Ruger Single Six.
342	00:20:49	00:20:52	Gun hasn't been fired.
343	00:20:52	00:20:53	Guess who he called yesterday?
344	00:20:53	00:20:55	Lady Heather.
345	00:20:55	00:20:59	Might have threatened her. And we both know how she likes to settle her own scores.
346	00:20:59	00:21:06	I'm going to get a warrant, but it may take me some time because I have to find a judge who isn't a client of hers.
347	00:21:08	00:21:11	You sure you've never seen her before?
348	00:21:11	00:21:12	You don't remember her?
349	00:21:12	00:21:15	No, sir. That picture was taken by the camera inside your cab.
350	00:21:15	00:21:16	Why don't you take another look?
351	00:21:19	00:21:20	Recognize her now?
352	00:21:20	00:21:23	You know, a lot of people get in my cab.
353	00:21:23	00:21:25	There's always a big convention in town.
354	00:21:25	00:21:29	Hey. Dru. I was born at night, but not last night, okay?
355	00:21:29	00:21:33	You picked her up at the steakhouse.
356	00:21:33	00:21:35	I know the last time she was seen alive, was in your yellow cab.
357	00:21:35	00:21:38	I know she was killed by a yellow car.
358	00:21:38	00:21:40	I found blood on your front bumper.
359	00:21:40	00:21:43	Okay, I, uh, I remember her now.
360	00:21:43	00:21:46	She wanted to go to MGM.
361	00:21:46	00:21:50	There is bad traffic, so she tells me to let her out.
362	00:21:50	00:21:51	She wants to walk.
363	00:21:52	00:21:53	Where'd you let her out?
364	00:21:54	00:21:56	Near the Monte Carlo.
365	00:21:56	00:22:03	Mr. Kambhatla, if I match the paint from your cab to the paint we found in her skull, do you realize how much trouble you're in?
366	00:22:04	00:22:06	'Cause I'm not sure you really do.
367	00:22:08	00:22:09	Scotty.
368	00:22:17	00:22:19	The older types of cameras only take stills.
369	00:22:19	00:22:23	They take them sequentially for 20 seconds any time a passenger door is opened.
370	00:22:23	00:22:24	Can you clarify the background?
371	00:22:24	00:22:25	Yeah.
372	00:22:28	00:22:30	I recognize the graphitti on that bench.
373	00:22:30	00:22:33	That's the street we found her on, right there.
374	00:22:33	00:22:35	So Mr. Kambhatla was lying.
375	00:22:35	00:22:37	That's nowhere near the Monte Carlo.
376	00:22:42	00:22:43	Go back to number two.
377	00:22:44	00:22:47	The wallet in her hand is... black.
378	00:22:49	00:22:51	And her wallet was white.
379	00:22:53	00:22:55	Go back, show me the last three photos, Archie.
380	00:22:55	00:22:56	Yeah.
381	00:22:56	00:22:58	Okay, so he's looking at her.
382	00:22:59	00:23:00	Looks down.
383	00:23:00	00:23:01	He's looking for something.
384	00:23:01	00:23:02	He looks up.
385	00:23:02	00:23:03	Well, he's pissed.
386	00:23:03	00:23:05	So she did snatch his wallet after all.
387	00:23:05	00:23:08	And he ran her down and took it back.
388	00:23:08	00:23:10	Well, we have him in custody.
389	00:23:10	00:23:12	We have his wallet.
390	00:23:12	00:23:15	Let's, uh, go see if her prints are on it.
391	00:23:15	00:23:16	Yeah. Thanks, Arch.
392	00:23:17	00:23:18	Yeah.
393	00:23:24	00:23:26	This window wasn't broken yesterday.
394	00:23:26	00:23:29	And I got a bullet in a poker player.
395	00:23:29	00:23:33	Well, the one that killed Porter's still inside him.
396	00:23:33	00:23:34	Porter was shot in the back.
397	00:23:34	00:23:37	He was facing away from the saloon.
398	00:23:40	00:23:44	To get to the window, this bullet had to be fired from the opposite direction.
399	00:23:47	00:23:49	There were two shooters.
400	00:23:55	00:23:58	Lead bullet. Cannelure.
401	00:23:58	00:23:59	We're looking for a revolver.
402	00:24:15	00:24:16	Oh, wow.
403	00:24:17	00:24:20	These look authentic.
404	00:24:20	00:24:22	All revolvers.
405	00:24:22	00:24:24	Case is unlocked.
406	00:24:26	00:24:28	I'll get the guns to ballistics.
407	00:24:28	00:24:30	I'll process the ammo boxes.
408	00:24:30	00:24:35	Sofia, Faith Maroney's prints were found on the cab driver's wallet so there's your motive.
409	00:24:35	00:24:36	No problem.
410	00:24:46	00:24:49	The paint from the dead girl's skull matched the paint on Chandru's cab.
411	00:24:49	00:24:51	Page two.
412	00:24:53	00:24:57	The paint chips from the street are not a match to the paint chips from her skull.
413	00:24:57	00:24:58	Are you sure about this?
414	00:24:58	00:25:02	I just finished a diabolical soduku in six minutes flat.
415	00:25:02	00:25:03	I'm positive.
416	00:25:03	00:25:05	Then what color were the other paint chips?
417	00:25:05	00:25:07	What did you have for lunch?
418	00:25:07	00:25:08	I had a ham sandwich.
419	00:25:08	00:25:09	Hmm?
420	00:25:09	00:25:11	It's a clue.
421	00:25:11	00:25:12	Your sandwich.
422	00:25:13	00:25:14	Oh.
423	00:25:14	00:25:20	The paint chips you collected are from two different cars, stuck together as a result of impact.
424	00:25:20	00:25:22	Yellow paint, black paint, clear coat.
425	00:25:22	00:25:26	The other half-- clear coat, black paint, yellow paint, clear coat, white.
426	00:25:26	00:25:30	That's a lot of canary yellow and engine black.
427	00:25:30	00:25:31	Cab-on-cab hate?
428	00:25:31	00:25:34	One half of the sandwich is from Dru's 29.
429	00:25:34	00:25:35	What about the other half?
430	00:25:35	00:25:38	You're looking for a white Ford that's been repainted yellow and black.
431	00:25:38	00:25:41	Sweet.
432	00:25:41	00:25:43	I'm glad I figured that out.
433	00:25:43	00:25:47	C.O.D.'s a single gunshot wound to the lower lumbar region.
434	00:25:47	00:25:50	Bullet entered here and then traveled slightly upward.
435	00:25:50	00:25:52	Where is the bullet?
436	00:25:52	00:25:53	Well, that's the fun part.
437	00:25:53	00:25:55	He didn't die from the initial wound.
438	00:25:55	00:26:00	It entered through his back and then penetrated the inferior vena cava.
439	00:26:02	00:26:06	It traveled through that vessel into his right lung.
440	00:26:06	00:26:08	It's called a bullet embolus.
441	00:26:08	00:26:09	and it's hard to find.
442	00:26:09	00:26:12	Most medical examiners would have missed it.
443	00:26:15	00:26:18	Full metal jacket, nine millimeter.
444	00:26:18	00:26:21	The bullet that I found at the saloon was from a revolver.
445	00:26:21	00:26:22	Colt single-action Army.
446	00:26:22	00:26:24	The gun that won the west.
447	00:26:24	00:26:28	That bullet is from a 20th century, high-capacity, semi-automatic pistol.
448	00:26:28	00:26:30	I... see a lot of bullets.
449	00:26:41	00:26:47	Well, it looks like Friendly bought a small fleet of white cabs from another company last year that went belly-up.
450	00:26:47	00:26:49	How small are we talking?
451	00:26:51	00:26:53	Seventy-five.
452	00:26:53	00:26:56	Paint samples from 75 cabs?
453	00:26:56	00:26:59	Well, we'll be back in the lab by next week.
454	00:27:35	00:27:36	Hey, Warrick.
455	00:27:36	00:27:39	I got what looks like fresh damage over here.
456	00:27:44	00:27:45	Do we know that guy?
457	00:27:48	00:27:50	Gus's cab is equipped with a new camera.
458	00:27:50	00:27:52	Video, not stills.
459	00:27:52	00:27:53	Motion-activated.
460	00:27:53	00:27:55	So the impact turns it on, huh?
461	00:27:55	00:27:57	Freeze that and grab a number off that cab.
462	00:28:00	00:28:03	7029-- that's Dru's cab.
463	00:28:04	00:28:07	If Dru was dispatched, then what was Gus doing at that steakhouse?
464	00:28:07	00:28:11	Well, he had to be staging, trying to steal Dru's fare.
465	00:28:11	00:28:13	Looks like Gus took the fight to the streets.
466	00:28:13	00:28:14	He hit him again right there.
467	00:28:16	00:28:18	Whoa.
468	00:28:18	00:28:19	Well, that's the corner.
469	00:28:20	00:28:25	And we know from the paint chips we found on the ground that Gus's cab collided with Dru's on that street.
470	00:28:25	00:28:29	Well, the airbags didn't deploy, so he must have been going under 15 miles an hour.
471	00:28:29	00:28:33	I can't see Dru's cab, so Gus must have rear-ended him when he was stopped.
472	00:28:33	00:28:34	It's physics.
473	00:28:35	00:28:42	Gus's cab transferred most of its energy into Dru's-- more than enough to launch him into the girl.
474	00:28:42	00:28:49	and car bumpers are designed to absorb the impact from another vehicle, but the bumper hitting her?
475	00:28:49	00:28:50	Would have been like a...
476	00:28:50	00:28:52	elephant hitting a flea.
477	00:28:53	00:28:55	You were in the wrong.
478	00:28:55	00:28:56	You were the one who was staging.
479	00:28:56	00:28:59	So why road rage Mr. Kambhatla?
480	00:28:59	00:29:02	Because he was gonna report it and get me fired.
481	00:29:02	00:29:04	I'm two months from retirement.
482	00:29:04	00:29:05	My wife's got MS.
483	00:29:05	00:29:07	I need my health benefits.
484	00:29:07	00:29:10	But I didn't hit that girl.
485	00:29:10	00:29:12	He did.
486	00:29:12	00:29:14	It's a bad neighborhood.
487	00:29:14	00:29:15	Nothing's open out there.
488	00:29:16	00:29:17	So why'd you drop her off?
489	00:29:17	00:29:20	She was screaming at me, Screw you, pull over.
490	00:29:22	00:29:23	Sorry.
491	00:29:23	00:29:25	You guys are crazy. I want out of this cab right now.
492	00:29:27	00:29:29	$6.25, please.
493	00:29:29	00:29:31	No way. I'm not paying for this ride.
494	00:29:32	00:29:33	Hey, wait!
495	00:29:34	00:29:35	You're a tease!
496	00:29:35	00:29:36	Give me back my wallet!
497	00:29:40	00:29:41	He tries to steal my fare.
498	00:29:41	00:29:44	She tries to steal my wallet, and I am arrested.
499	00:29:44	00:29:46	So why didn't you just report the accident?
500	00:29:46	00:29:48	You hit a pedestrian, it is always your fault.
501	00:29:48	00:29:54	Hey, you were stopped and Gus hit you, pushing your cab into her.
502	00:29:54	00:29:56	Now, that's not your fault.
503	00:29:56	00:29:57	Okay?
504	00:29:57	00:29:59	Gus said it was.
505	00:29:59	00:30:02	And he has been driving for 30 years.
506	00:30:02	00:30:05	My cab hit her, so I am guilty.
507	00:30:05	00:30:07	Yeah, well, Gus doesn't know the law, but I do.
508	00:30:07	00:30:11	What else did he say to you?
509	00:30:11	00:30:16	Mr. Kambhatla, this may be the last chance you have to tell me the truth, now.
510	00:30:20	00:30:22	We made a deal.
511	00:30:22	00:30:24	Okay. Okay. What kind of deal?
512	00:30:24	00:30:35	He said if I don't report him for staging, and hitting me, then he would keep quiet about me hitting the girl.
513	00:30:38	00:30:41	And I can stay in this country...
514	00:30:41	00:30:43	with my mother and sisters.
515	00:30:43	00:30:47	I need to be here to make money for them.
516	00:30:47	00:30:50	I'm telling the truth now.
517	00:30:50	00:30:52	Is going to be okay, right?
518	00:30:52	00:30:55	No, sir, unfortunately, that's not the way it works.
519	00:30:55	00:31:01	I've got you for obstruction, for fleeing the scene, and now you're an accessory.
520	00:31:01	00:31:03	I'm sorry, man.
521	00:31:03	00:31:06	I know you're confused, but...
522	00:31:06	00:31:08	you just made a deal with the wrong guy.
523	00:31:23	00:31:24	This isn't a good time.
524	00:31:24	00:31:26	We have a warrant to search your house.
525	00:31:26	00:31:29	And you'd better put some sunblock on because we're going downtown.
526	00:31:29	00:31:32	My memory isn't any better than it was yesterday.
527	00:31:32	00:31:35	I'm not up to it.
528	00:31:35	00:31:36	Well, we'll swing by the hospital.
529	00:31:36	00:31:41	And you can explain to them why you checked yourself out early, against doctor's orders.
530	00:31:41	00:31:43	We're investigating a homicide.
531	00:31:43	00:31:45	I don't understand.
532	00:31:45	00:31:46	Where were you last night?
533	00:31:46	00:31:48	You may come in.
534	00:31:51	00:31:53	I was here.
535	00:31:54	00:31:56	Can anyone verify that?
536	00:31:56	00:31:59	Preferably someone not on the payroll.
537	00:32:01	00:32:03	Captain Brass would like to know where I was last night.
538	00:32:07	00:32:09	She was here.
539	00:32:10	00:32:12	With me.
540	00:32:25	00:32:27	You were there all night.
541	00:32:27	00:32:30	Want to explain why?
542	00:32:30	00:32:39	Look, I know that you don't go home and cuddle your insects every single night, but why would you go there knowing that we're in the middle of an investigation?
543	00:32:39	00:32:41	And now she's a prime suspect with you as her alibi.
544	00:32:41	00:32:45	It was a social call, that's all.
545	00:32:46	00:32:51	So, when your personal life gets tangled up in a case, that's off limits?
546	00:32:51	00:32:52	Yes.
547	00:32:52	00:32:54	Isn't that a little hypocritical?
548	00:32:54	00:32:56	Apparently so.
549	00:32:56	00:32:59	You know I'd slap you, but I think you'd enjoy it too much.
550	00:33:01	00:33:04	Look, I went to Heather's on a hunch.
551	00:33:04	00:33:09	There's something not right with her.
552	00:33:13	00:33:14	Your timing sucked.
553	00:33:17	00:33:19	What's this?
554	00:33:20	00:33:23	So now you're building your own?
555	00:33:23	00:33:24	Yeah.
556	00:33:24	00:33:26	Keeps my hands busy.
557	00:33:26	00:33:32	You think I paid someone to kill Porter and then used Grissom as my alibi?
558	00:33:32	00:33:34	And with your history, yes.
559	00:33:34	00:33:35	How do you know Vernon Porter?
560	00:33:35	00:33:37	He did some work for me.
561	00:33:37	00:33:38	I helped him get the job at Oakley's.
562	00:33:38	00:33:42	You know what? That's the first thing you said to me that doesn't sound like a lie.
563	00:33:42	00:33:43	What kind of work?
564	00:33:43	00:33:45	I needed to locate someone.
565	00:33:45	00:33:47	So an ex-cop does some legwork for you.
566	00:33:47	00:33:50	So what happened-- did you have a falling out or he threaten you?
567	00:33:51	00:33:53	First skipped message.
568	00:33:53	00:33:55	02 p.m.
569	00:33:55	00:33:57	Hey, Heather, Vernon.
570	00:33:57	00:33:59	Looks like you got yourself into something.
571	00:33:59	00:34:00	If you need anything, call me.
572	00:34:01	00:34:04	Call me anyway. Let me know you're okay.
573	00:34:04	00:34:07	Does that sound like a man who wants to hurt me, Captain Brass?
574	00:34:07	00:34:08	Oh, I don't know, Heather. I don't know.
575	00:34:08	00:34:14	I mean, you get assaulted at Old West Town where he works, he calls it in, then he ends up dead.
576	00:34:14	00:34:16	What is it, just one big coincidence?
577	00:34:16	00:34:18	I already told you I was there on business.
578	00:34:18	00:34:20	Mr. Porter had nothing to do with it.
579	00:34:20	00:34:21	Yeah, but it was your business that got him killed.
580	00:34:22	00:34:25	Come on, come on, we both know that you weren't there for some Western hoedown.
581	00:34:25	00:34:26	So what were you doing there?
582	00:34:29	00:34:33	The semen on the tissue in the bathroom did not come from Vernon Porter.
583	00:34:33	00:34:38	Well, the underwear that I pulled from the toilet was a 38-inch waist.
584	00:34:38	00:34:39	Porter was a 34.
585	00:34:39	00:34:40	He didn't attack Heather.
586	00:34:40	00:34:42	But we know he was there.
587	00:34:42	00:34:49	One of Heather's clients pays for a kinky Wild West fantasy only to discover he had an audience?
588	00:34:49	00:34:52	Well, I don't want to derail this, but why kill Porter and not go after Heather?
589	00:34:52	00:34:53	'Cause she's not talking.
590	00:34:53	00:34:55	Her business is based on discretion.
591	00:34:55	00:34:57	Couldn't count on Porter's discretion.
592	00:34:58	00:35:02	So this client goes back to Oakley's the next night and shoots Porter.
593	00:35:03	00:35:07	Oh, Mandy got a hit off the revolver and the ammo box.
594	00:35:07	00:35:09	Benjamin Oakley.
595	00:35:09	00:35:10	His family owns the place.
596	00:35:11	00:35:12	He had access.
597	00:35:12	00:35:14	Yeah, I'm calling Brass.
598	00:35:14	00:35:16	Sara will fill you in.
599	00:35:16	00:35:18	Jim...
600	00:35:19	00:35:20	We may have a suspect.
601	00:35:26	00:35:29	I'm the only one Heather trusts.
602	00:35:29	00:35:31	I get it.
603	00:35:33	00:35:34	Sara...
604	00:35:36	00:35:37	Yeah?
605	00:35:39	00:35:41	It's fine.
606	00:35:41	00:35:43	Do what you need to do.
607	00:35:54	00:36:01	When the submissive accepts they're in control, that's when they embrace their true power.
608	00:36:01	00:36:02	They can say stop.
609	00:36:02	00:36:06	They can choose to either end the pain or continue enduring it.
610	00:36:06	00:36:07	But...
611	00:36:07	00:36:11	higher consciousness doesn't negate our animal instinct to survive.
612	00:36:12	00:36:15	Dr. Grissom, you requested a custody file from the court.
613	00:36:15	00:36:17	Thank you, Judy.
614	00:36:17	00:36:21	I'm assuming it's for your investigation into the Miniature Killer.
615	00:36:21	00:36:25	Everybody in the lab believes you're gonna get him.
616	00:37:02	00:37:05	She's all I have left of Zoe.
617	00:37:05	00:37:08	Can you tell if she's ever given birth?
618	00:37:08	00:37:15	There was some scarring on her pelvic bones, but given the condition of the body, it's hard to say for sure.
619	00:37:15	00:37:17	This is your granddaughter.
620	00:37:17	00:37:19	Did you take this picture?
621	00:37:19	00:37:21	I hired someone to find her.
622	00:37:23	00:37:28	I can't give her love, but I can give her the freedom to be who she wants to be.
623	00:37:33	00:37:36	Is this official police business?
624	00:37:36	00:37:37	No.
625	00:37:37	00:37:39	Did Heather send you?
626	00:37:39	00:37:41	No, I'm just a friend of hers.
627	00:37:41	00:37:44	Did she tell you about me?
628	00:37:44	00:37:46	Not really.
629	00:37:46	00:37:47	We were married very young.
630	00:37:47	00:37:49	Didn't last long.
631	00:37:49	00:37:53	Heather left without telling me she was pregnant.
632	00:37:53	00:37:58	I wasn't aware I had a child until after Zoe was already dead.
633	00:38:00	00:38:03	That's Zoe's daughter, Heather's granddaughter.
634	00:38:03	00:38:06	Her name is Alison.
635	00:38:06	00:38:09	So why are you here?
636	00:38:09	00:38:11	I'm just trying to understand what's happening to her.
637	00:38:14	00:38:21	I'm aware that the court has denied her visitation rights.
638	00:38:21	00:38:23	Wouldn't you?
639	00:38:23	00:38:25	I'm not sure.
640	00:38:27	00:38:30	Has Heather tried to give you any money for Alison?
641	00:38:30	00:38:33	Yes, the day before yesterday I got a call from the bank.
642	00:38:33	00:38:39	Heather had set up a very generous trust fund for her, no strings attached.
643	00:38:39	00:38:41	I assumed she sold her house.
644	00:38:41	00:38:43	Can you tell me how much?
645	00:38:43	00:38:46	$843,508.
646	00:38:46	00:38:54	I know Heather had closed her business a few months ago trying to convince the judge she'd be a fit guardian, so it had to be from the sale.
647	00:38:55	00:39:05	I wonder if she calculated the exact amount it would cost to raise a child and put her through college, especially at Harvard.
648	00:39:05	00:39:10	That's where she sent Zoe.
649	00:39:13	00:39:16	But it wasn't her house that she sold.
650	00:39:21	00:39:23	You took a shot at Porter.
651	00:39:23	00:39:25	That's attempted murder.
652	00:39:25	00:39:29	Your dad's not going to like that, Benny.
653	00:39:29	00:39:31	This is a warrant for your DNA.
654	00:39:31	00:39:33	Why do you need my DNA?
655	00:39:33	00:39:36	To prove that you also attacked Heather Kessler.
656	00:39:36	00:39:37	And that makes two attempted murders.
657	00:39:37	00:39:40	And that adds up to a lot of jail time, bud.
658	00:39:41	00:39:42	Open up.
659	00:39:42	00:39:44	I didn't touch her, okay?
660	00:39:44	00:39:46	I didn't kill Porter.
661	00:39:46	00:39:47	What do you want, a gold star for being a bad shot?
662	00:39:50	00:39:51	Porter knew I lied.
663	00:39:51	00:39:53	He wanted 50 grand to keep his mouth shut.
664	00:39:53	00:39:55	And I was gonna pay him.
665	00:39:55	00:39:59	I went to the bank to get the money, but somebody drained the account.
666	00:39:59	00:40:01	There was a million dollars in that account last week.
667	00:40:01	00:40:02	Who authorized the transfer?
668	00:40:02	00:40:04	Jack Oakley.
669	00:40:04	00:40:07	I went there to kill my father.
670	00:40:07	00:40:12	I knew he was going to meet Heather, but for some reason, she didn't show.
671	00:40:12	00:40:15	And Porter got up the courage to ask my dad for the money.
672	00:40:15	00:40:18	He'd seen my father with Heather.
673	00:40:18	00:40:19	You sick bastard!
674	00:40:19	00:40:21	You got 24 hours, then I turn you in!
675	00:40:33	00:40:35	The Marquis de Sade's got nothing on my old man.
676	00:40:35	00:40:38	Inflicting pain is his idea of foreplay.
677	00:40:38	00:40:41	You're your mother's son, not mine.
678	00:40:43	00:40:47	Do you know how much money he spent abusing women?
679	00:40:47	00:40:53	He didn't leave anything for my mother and me except for more abuse.
680	00:40:54	00:40:57	It had to stop.
681	00:40:57	00:40:59	Where is he?
682	00:40:59	00:41:01	His phone's off; every time his phone's off, he's with her.
683	00:41:01	00:41:02	Is he at the saloon?
684	00:41:02	00:41:04	No, he wouldn't do that, not after Porter.
685	00:41:04	00:41:07	He's got to be at Heather's.
686	00:41:11	00:41:15	So your sick fantasy was to kill her.
687	00:41:15	00:41:17	I didn't do anything.
688	00:41:17	00:41:19	She solicited me.
689	00:41:19	00:41:20	Strictly a business deal.
690	00:41:21	00:41:23	She needed the money.
691	00:41:23	00:41:27	I paid her close to $1 million for this, you know that?
692	00:41:27	00:41:29	That's about all I'm gonna say.
693	00:41:29	00:41:32	I'll be talking with my lawyer.
694	00:41:35	00:41:37	Too bad you spent the million.
695	00:41:37	00:41:39	You could use it on your defense.
696	00:41:42	00:41:46	Look, Heather, for what it's worth, I think you're in the clear.
697	00:41:46	00:41:48	The D.A.'s not gonna press charges.
698	00:41:49	00:41:54	Attempted murder, assisted suicide, the lines are kind of blurred.
699	00:41:54	00:41:56	But do yourself a favor.
700	00:41:56	00:41:58	Get some help.
701	00:42:23	00:42:25	Leave me alone.
