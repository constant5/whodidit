0	00:02:14	00:02:17	Grissom... a stay.
1	00:02:17	00:02:20	hair analysis.
2	00:02:21	00:02:27	I already overnighted the six pubic hairs found on the victim to Norfolk-- Department of Criminal Justice-- for mitochondrial DNA analysis.
3	00:02:36	00:02:39	Defense thinks DNA's a magic pill for exoneration.
4	00:02:39	00:02:41	I doubt if it's going to change the outcome.
5	00:02:43	00:02:45	You don't know what I'm talking about.
6	00:02:45	00:02:47	Not really.
7	00:02:47	00:02:49	People v. John Mathers.
8	00:02:49	00:02:51	Serial. Western LVU. I was a rookie...
9	00:02:51	00:02:53	Three dead coeds?
10	00:02:53	00:02:56	All sexually assaulted, but no semen was found.
11	00:02:56	00:02:57	Suspected he wore a condom.
12	00:02:57	00:02:58	Dumped in garbage bags.
13	00:02:59	00:03:03	Case with the strongest evidence Charlene Roth.
14	00:03:03	00:03:06	Mathers, a campus security guard got murder one for that.
15	00:03:06	00:03:08	When are you going to get the test back?
16	00:03:08	00:03:10	I put a rush on it.
17	00:03:12	00:03:14	Is this your first one?
18	00:03:14	00:03:18	First to exhaust all of his appeals and get an execution date.
19	00:03:20	00:03:21	How many have you had?
20	00:03:21	00:03:23	Two.
21	00:03:25	00:03:27	So, how do you feel about it?
22	00:03:28	00:03:32	Mathers was convicted and sent to death row by a jury of his peers.
23	00:03:32	00:03:33	I played a small part.
24	00:03:33	00:03:35	I presented my findings...
25	00:03:35	00:03:36	Non-responsive.
26	00:03:38	00:03:40	Okay.
27	00:03:40	00:03:42	I haven't figured out how I feel yet.
28	00:03:42	00:03:44	It's just about evidence.
29	00:03:44	00:03:47	It's not up to you whether he lives or dies.
30	00:03:48	00:03:50	Case has no face.
31	00:04:35	00:04:38	Cops did a welfare check on this residence.
32	00:04:38	00:04:46	A girl, 17, didn't show up for work and they found Dad passed out on the sofa in a blood-soaked T-shirt.
33	00:04:46	00:04:49	Did he have anything to say about his daughter?
34	00:04:49	00:04:52	Mr. Reston, uh, can't remember what day it is.
35	00:04:52	00:04:53	Claims he was in a bar fight.
36	00:04:53	00:04:55	Pass test?
37	00:04:55	00:04:57	His blood alcohol level is .37.
38	00:04:57	00:05:00	Ooh... alcoholic.
39	00:05:00	00:05:02	Yeah.
40	00:05:02	00:05:04	Lucky me.
41	00:05:04	00:05:08	Hey, buddy, this is Sara Sidle of the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
42	00:05:08	00:05:10	She's going to ask you some questions.
43	00:05:10	00:05:14	Sir, I need your shirt and I need to see your hands.
44	00:05:14	00:05:16	Shirt and hands!
45	00:05:27	00:05:28	Hey.
46	00:05:28	00:05:30	Hey.
47	00:05:31	00:05:33	People are pigs.
48	00:05:33	00:05:35	Don't insult the pigs, Nick.
49	00:05:35	00:05:37	They're actually very clean.
50	00:05:42	00:05:44	Must be the girl's room.
51	00:05:45	00:05:48	Doesn't seem like the same house.
52	00:05:53	00:05:55	Dead bolts on her bedroom door.
53	00:05:55	00:05:57	Trying to keep something out.
54	00:05:57	00:05:58	Hmm.
55	00:06:06	00:06:08	A bedroom refrigerator?
56	00:06:11	00:06:16	There's milk, fruit... a toaster?
57	00:06:16	00:06:19	Guess they weren't much on family dinners.
58	00:06:26	00:06:28	Nick?
59	00:06:30	00:06:32	A gi and a black belt.
60	00:06:33	00:06:36	Trained in the art of self-defense.
61	00:07:02	00:07:04	I'll bag it.
62	00:07:35	00:07:38	I heard Mathers had that I.V. in his arm and everything, when that call came in.
63	00:07:40	00:07:44	Never had a death penalty case get that far.
64	00:07:44	00:07:45	Just working it all out?
65	00:07:45	00:07:48	Yeah. Old case, new eyes, new technology.
66	00:07:48	00:07:50	This evidence was processed, what, 15 years ago?
67	00:07:51	00:07:52	That was before DNA.
68	00:07:52	00:07:55	Now that the case has been reopened I can re-evaluate all three murders.
69	00:07:55	00:08:04	We always thought Mathers was good for the other two but if they overturn Charlene Roth with the new DNA we can go back and try Mathers with the other two murders with the new evidence.
70	00:08:04	00:08:06	Keep Mathers in prison.
71	00:08:10	00:08:12	You pro or con?
72	00:08:12	00:08:14	Pro, if he did it.
73	00:08:14	00:08:15	The applications sucks, though.
74	00:08:15	00:08:17	There's a lot of brown skin on that row.
75	00:08:17	00:08:18	Yeah.
76	00:08:18	00:08:20	What about you?
77	00:08:20	00:08:22	I try not to give it much thought.
78	00:08:22	00:08:24	I stick to the work. Really?
79	00:08:24	00:08:29	Campus police found the victim Charlene Roth in this trash bag.
80	00:08:29	00:08:30	The trash bag, yeah.
81	00:08:30	00:08:31	I was looking at that.
82	00:08:31	00:08:33	Processed with superglue, rhodamine, laser.
83	00:08:34	00:08:36	No prints found though.
84	00:08:36	00:08:38	Who's working the print lab tonight?
85	00:08:38	00:08:40	Franco. Just off of days.
86	00:08:43	00:08:47	Hey, I hear you're cheating on me with an out-of-state DNA analyst.
87	00:08:47	00:08:49	Apples and oranges, Greg.
88	00:08:49	00:08:52	15-year-old hair samples no roots, room- temperature storage.
89	00:08:53	00:08:54	Room temp?
90	00:08:54	00:08:56	Yeah, that's how we stored hair evidence back then.
91	00:08:56	00:08:57	Microscopy was king.
92	00:08:57	00:08:59	Really? I thought Elvis was king.
93	00:08:59	00:09:00	And you are how old?
94	00:09:00	00:09:02	Age is irrelevant in our relationship.
95	00:09:02	00:09:05	Maybe so, but face it, Greg you just don't have the equipment.
96	00:09:05	00:09:10	The government results won't give you an individual profile and you can't put them through CODIS.
97	00:09:10	00:09:13	Well, maternal lineage is good enough on this one.
98	00:09:13	00:09:16	No one else on Mathers' mother's side is a suspect.
99	00:09:16	00:09:19	So, if it's a match, the stay is lifted he's back in the chamber.
100	00:09:19	00:09:21	If not, we're back in court.
101	00:09:30	00:09:31	Jacqui...
102	00:09:31	00:09:33	I'm so glad you're back on nights.
103	00:09:33	00:09:34	Got a good one for you.
104	00:09:37	00:09:39	Trash bag? Yeah, love it.
105	00:09:39	00:09:41	Give it some vacuum metal deposition.
106	00:09:41	00:09:42	Hottest thing going for plastic.
107	00:09:42	00:09:45	If there's anything to be found, my machine'll find it.
108	00:09:45	00:09:46	And, um, super-rush.
109	00:09:46	00:09:48	You're in a race with the federal lab.
110	00:09:48	00:09:53	Make my night; love to compete with the Feds. You and me need to catch up. How's Lindsey?
111	00:09:53	00:09:56	Second grade, tons of homework.
112	00:09:56	00:09:58	Lucky for her she got your smarts, not Eddie's.
113	00:09:58	00:10:00	Now I know why I missed you so much.
114	00:10:00	00:10:01	So, page me as soon as you're done.
115	00:10:01	00:10:02	Mm-hmm.
116	00:10:02	00:10:03	Putting you up first.
117	00:10:04	00:10:05	You owe me a beer.
118	00:10:05	00:10:06	Yep.
119	00:10:20	00:10:22	Looks like somebody's been doing some digging.
120	00:10:54	00:10:56	Glock.
121	00:10:56	00:10:58	Laser sight.
122	00:10:58	00:11:00	Slide's missing.
123	00:11:00	00:11:03	Mr. Reston was a bit of a garage tinkerer.
124	00:11:03	00:11:05	Great. Drunks with guns.
125	00:11:11	00:11:12	Hey. Hey.
126	00:11:12	00:11:15	M11-9.
127	00:11:15	00:11:16	Empty box.
128	00:11:16	00:11:18	He didn't have any kind of weapon.
129	00:11:18	00:11:19	Okay, we're into it.
130	00:11:19	00:11:22	I'm going to take Reston's shirt back to Greg.
131	00:11:22	00:11:23	Mm-hm. Do me a favor.
132	00:11:23	00:11:24	Yeah?
133	00:11:24	00:11:27	Inside, bloody towel, bagged and tagged.
134	00:11:27	00:11:28	You got it. Thanks.
135	00:11:28	00:11:32	Woo. After this place, I need a shower.
136	00:11:51	00:11:53	There's our M11.
137	00:11:59	00:12:02	16-round magazine.
138	00:12:02	00:12:04	Two remaining.
139	00:12:06	00:12:08	One in the chamber.
140	00:12:10	00:12:12	Modified to fully automatic.
141	00:12:12	00:12:15	Up to 14 rounds expended and unaccounted for.
142	00:12:15	00:12:17	Missing girl's old man's got blood all over him.
143	00:12:18	00:12:19	Blood in her room...
144	00:12:19	00:12:22	I think it's time for dear old dad to go to detox.
145	00:12:22	00:12:28	I would like a vanilla ice soy blended latte, please.
146	00:12:28	00:12:29	Ms. Willows.
147	00:12:29	00:12:30	Yes?
148	00:12:30	00:12:31	Sally Roth.
149	00:12:31	00:12:32	My husband Tom.
150	00:12:35	00:12:36	I'm sorry. Do I know you?
151	00:12:37	00:12:40	We're Charlene Roth's parents.
152	00:12:42	00:12:45	Mr. and Mrs. Roth.
153	00:12:45	00:12:47	I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.
154	00:12:47	00:12:50	We were just wondering if you had any news.
155	00:12:50	00:12:53	You know...
156	00:12:53	00:12:56	any news has to go through the Attorney General's office.
157	00:12:56	00:12:59	I can't divulge any information on an open case.
158	00:12:59	00:13:01	He was convicted.
159	00:13:01	00:13:03	It is not an open case to us.
160	00:13:03	00:13:05	I was confident at trial.
161	00:13:05	00:13:06	I'm still confident.
162	00:13:06	00:13:08	The evidence is solid.
163	00:13:08	00:13:10	If the court overturns the conv...
164	00:13:10	00:13:12	We just can't go through another trial.
165	00:13:13	00:13:17	Uh, well, you will have an answer very soon.
166	00:13:17	00:13:18	I'm sure of it.
167	00:13:18	00:13:21	Excuse me. I need to go.
168	00:13:24	00:13:26	What's going on? I'm not on call.
169	00:13:26	00:13:29	I know. I called you because your name's on the memo.
170	00:13:29	00:13:30	Which memo?
171	00:13:30	00:13:33	Young female, bound, trash bag.
172	00:13:33	00:13:36	Copycats come out of the woodwork every time there's an execution.
173	00:13:36	00:13:39	Mather's attorney is going to have a field day.
174	00:13:39	00:13:46	Everybody liked Mathers for the Kent and Reese cases but the DA wouldn't file because he already had a slam dunk with Charlene Roth.
175	00:13:46	00:13:49	How many times can you fry a guy?
176	00:13:49	00:13:50	Right.
177	00:13:50	00:13:53	Maintenance guy thought it was trash.
178	00:13:53	00:13:54	Picked it up, ripped open.
179	00:13:55	00:13:56	Body dump.
180	00:13:56	00:13:58	Just like 15 years ago.
181	00:14:45	00:14:47	You ready for me?
182	00:14:47	00:14:48	Not yet.
183	00:14:48	00:14:50	May I?
184	00:14:50	00:14:52	Sure.
185	00:14:56	00:14:58	What do you think this is?
186	00:14:58	00:14:59	That's Grissom's bailiwick, not mine.
187	00:14:59	00:15:02	That's what I was thinking-- bug.
188	00:15:02	00:15:03	What you got?
189	00:15:03	00:15:04	Two-fer.
190	00:15:04	00:15:08	Looks like some kind of a bug casing and black fibers.
191	00:15:08	00:15:11	She's all yours, David.
192	00:15:17	00:15:20	How come I get you?
193	00:15:20	00:15:24	Grissom says it's precautionary in case Mathers gets overturned and you get swamped.
194	00:15:25	00:15:27	I'm glad to have the help.
195	00:15:27	00:15:29	This looks familiar.
196	00:15:29	00:15:33	A little too familiar.
197	00:15:33	00:15:35	Let's figure out how she got here.
198	00:16:10	00:16:11	Hey, Griss...
199	00:16:12	00:16:15	found a density change.
200	00:16:15	00:16:16	The screen's showing something.
201	00:16:18	00:16:21	What's your depth estimate?
202	00:16:21	00:16:22	Two and a half feet.
203	00:16:22	00:16:25	Oh, dear.
204	00:16:25	00:16:28	Shovels and screens, chutes and ladders.
205	00:16:28	00:16:30	Yeah.
206	00:16:44	00:16:46	A little more.
207	00:16:46	00:16:47	There we go.
208	00:16:54	00:16:55	She's in rigor.
209	00:16:55	00:16:56	At least 12 hours.
210	00:17:02	00:17:05	Get out your ten card and print her.
211	00:17:05	00:17:07	But look out for this blue paint.
212	00:17:07	00:17:09	Catherine's going to need to see it.
213	00:17:17	00:17:19	Illegal burial of a domestic animal.
214	00:17:19	00:17:20	Weak.
215	00:17:20	00:17:21	I'll cover him back up.
216	00:17:21	00:17:27	So Debbie Reston never showed up at work and she's not buried in the backyard.
217	00:17:27	00:17:28	Where did Debbie go?
218	00:17:28	00:17:30	I don't know her schedule.
219	00:17:30	00:17:33	She works, goes to school.
220	00:17:33	00:17:35	I hardly ever see her.
221	00:17:35	00:17:38	She's 17. She lives in your house.
222	00:17:38	00:17:42	You're going to have to do better than that.
223	00:17:42	00:17:46	Stuck-up bitch is ashamed of me.
224	00:17:46	00:17:50	Can't wait to graduate high school and move out.
225	00:17:52	00:17:54	coffee shop.
226	00:17:54	00:17:56	Got a car.
227	00:17:56	00:17:57	What kind of car?
228	00:17:57	00:18:01	VW convertible, blue.
229	00:18:01	00:18:07	And as a concerned parent, you're going to ask me to put out a broadcast, aren't you?
230	00:18:07	00:18:09	Whatever.
231	00:18:09	00:18:11	Is the car in her name or yours?
232	00:18:11	00:18:15	I'm going to need the license plate number.
233	00:18:15	00:18:17	You listening to me?
234	00:18:17	00:18:19	I just left Greg in DNA.
235	00:18:19	00:18:21	Blood on Reston's shirt is his own.
236	00:18:21	00:18:22	Blood on the towel?
237	00:18:23	00:18:24	Eight markers match. Family member.
238	00:18:24	00:18:26	There's only two people in the house.
239	00:18:26	00:18:29	It's probably Debbie's but there isn't that much blood on the towel.
240	00:18:29	00:18:32	So what? Innocuous injury?
241	00:18:32	00:18:34	That's what I'm thinking.
242	00:18:34	00:18:37	You got kids?
243	00:18:37	00:18:40	They think it's all about them.
244	00:18:40	00:18:42	Like I owe her.
245	00:18:42	00:18:45	You owe your daughter more than being a drunk.
246	00:18:48	00:18:51	You know, I think that maybe jail might be the best thing for you right now.
247	00:18:51	00:18:55	I think she just took off...
248	00:18:55	00:18:56	like her mother.
249	00:18:56	00:18:58	Can you believe this guy?
250	00:18:58	00:19:02	I wouldn't blame his kid if she just took off.
251	00:19:04	00:19:08	Hey. Catherine and I got a case at the university-- dead female.
252	00:19:08	00:19:09	Prints just came back.
253	00:19:09	00:19:13	Matches your missing girl, Debbie Reston.
254	00:19:13	00:19:16	Brass just put a broadcast out on her car.
255	00:19:16	00:19:18	Then my guys will find it.
256	00:19:18	00:19:20	They're posting her now.
257	00:19:23	00:19:26	Crazy world out there.
258	00:19:28	00:19:30	Sorry I'm late.
259	00:19:30	00:19:31	So, where are we?
260	00:19:31	00:19:33	Debbie Reston, 17.
261	00:19:33	00:19:36	She was taking a night class at Western LVU.
262	00:19:36	00:19:38	Prereq for early admission.
263	00:19:38	00:19:41	So technically she was a Western LVU student.
264	00:19:41	00:19:43	Yep. Just like Mathers' other victims.
265	00:19:43	00:19:45	Thought Mathers was on Death Row.
266	00:19:45	00:19:47	Mm-hmm.
267	00:19:47	00:19:48	Doc, you were here back then.
268	00:19:48	00:19:50	Tell me why this one's different.
269	00:19:50	00:19:55	Suspect must be intimately familiar with the minutiae of the prior cases.
270	00:19:57	00:19:59	cause of death-- strangulation.
271	00:19:59	00:20:05	Bruising on her wrists plastic zip tie, navy-blue paint.
272	00:20:05	00:20:10	defensive wounds on the hands.
273	00:20:10	00:20:16	Whatever she grabbed onto shattered and caused these lacerations.
274	00:20:16	00:20:19	Is that before or after she got the paint on her hands?
275	00:20:19	00:20:24	After. One of these cuts sliced right through the paint.
276	00:20:24	00:20:26	The paint was there first.
277	00:20:36	00:20:38	It's still wet.
278	00:20:38	00:20:40	So she's been dead at least 12 hours, right?
279	00:20:40	00:20:41	Right.
280	00:20:41	00:20:47	What kind of paint doesn't dry in 12 hours, I wonder.
281	00:21:23	00:21:25	Ms. Willows.
282	00:21:26	00:21:29	I heard you're investigating the murder at Western LVU.
283	00:21:29	00:21:32	Female, young, bound dumped in a trash bag.
284	00:21:34	00:21:41	You know that I can't confirm or deny any information regarding an active investigation.
285	00:21:41	00:21:42	Excuse me.
286	00:21:42	00:21:44	Ms. Willows, my client's life is on the line here.
287	00:21:44	00:21:46	We've always maintained John Mathers' innocence.
288	00:21:46	00:21:49	Ms. Campbell, I have no personal opinion about your client.
289	00:21:49	00:21:53	I tested the evidence in his case and that evidence failed to exonerate him.
290	00:21:53	00:21:54	15 years ago. Before DNA.
291	00:21:54	00:21:56	Before the real killer struck again.
292	00:21:56	00:22:00	You are going to test the pubic hair sent to the federal lab against the new suspect...
293	00:22:00	00:22:02	What suspect?
294	00:22:02	00:22:03	I can't help you.
295	00:22:03	00:22:06	You CSIs are biased for the prosecution.
296	00:22:06	00:22:10	You decide ahead of time how you want the evidence to come out.
297	00:22:10	00:22:12	Ms. Campbell, I am only an interpreter of the evidence.
298	00:22:12	00:22:14	I know how to make the evidence speak to me.
299	00:22:14	00:22:15	I don't care about the outcome.
300	00:22:15	00:22:18	How about guilt or innocence?
301	00:22:18	00:22:20	John was 15 seconds from execution.
302	00:22:20	00:22:22	Sure you're not biased?
303	00:22:22	00:22:24	I hear the same evidence speaking.
304	00:22:24	00:22:25	You know what it's telling me.
305	00:22:25	00:22:29	The killer's still out there.
306	00:22:44	00:22:46	It's Debbie Reston's car.
307	00:22:47	00:22:50	Looks like you and I are officially running with the same case.
308	00:22:50	00:22:51	Yeah?
309	00:22:51	00:22:54	It's got to be the cleanest tape lift I've ever seen.
310	00:22:54	00:22:56	There's no stains of any kind in this car.
311	00:22:56	00:22:59	Whatever happened to her happened after she left her car.
312	00:22:59	00:23:01	Debbie Reston was taking Economics 101.
313	00:23:01	00:23:05	00 to 8 Never missed a class before last night.
314	00:23:05	00:23:06	Well, this is my alma mater.
315	00:23:06	00:23:08	Econ 101-- that's Sabian Hall.
316	00:23:08	00:23:10	It's a long walk from here but I know the way.
317	00:23:12	00:23:14	I'll have to catch up with you.
318	00:23:21	00:23:23	Damn.
319	00:23:25	00:23:27	It's still wet.
320	00:23:34	00:23:36	What's the first thing you'd do if you got paint on your hands?
321	00:23:38	00:23:39	Wash it off.
322	00:23:43	00:23:47	We found glass in the lacerations on her right hand.
323	00:23:55	00:23:58	I'll see if I can get a match from this.
324	00:23:58	00:24:01	He painted the railing and just waited by the water fountain.
325	00:24:01	00:24:03	Victim was like a fly in a spiderweb.
326	00:24:13	00:24:16	We just learned something we didn't know about the prior murders.
327	00:24:16	00:24:19	Yes, what the paint was all about.
328	00:24:19	00:24:24	And if we just learned about it now how did the copycat killer know?
329	00:24:27	00:24:30	Looks like Debbie isn't the only one who got paint on her hands.
330	00:24:30	00:24:34	Well, maybe he was waiting till he saw the girl he wanted.
331	00:24:35	00:24:36	That's creepy.
332	00:24:41	00:24:45	I'll call the Fire Department, get a circular saw.
333	00:24:45	00:24:47	Take this back to the lab.
334	00:24:52	00:24:55	I've got a backpack.
335	00:24:55	00:24:57	Wallet...
336	00:24:59	00:25:01	Debbie Reston.
337	00:25:01	00:25:02	Credit cards...
338	00:25:02	00:25:04	money, keys.
339	00:25:06	00:25:09	Not what he was looking for.
340	00:25:12	00:25:13	What are you doing?
341	00:25:13	00:25:16	I found pieces of this in the victim's hair.
342	00:25:16	00:25:18	What's it look like to you?
343	00:25:18	00:25:20	Hmm, what does it sound like?
344	00:25:23	00:25:27	With the exception of the termite queen the cicada is the longest-living insect.
345	00:25:27	00:25:34	Spends 17 years dormant underground and then the cicada nymph emerges and sheds its skin.
346	00:25:51	00:25:57	As adults they flit around for about five weeks of activity in the hot sun and then they die.
347	00:25:57	00:26:00	They spend their whole lives waiting for the end.
348	00:26:00	00:26:02	Not unlike death row.
349	00:26:38	00:26:40	This is the spot.
350	00:26:40	00:26:43	You can see the path and the rail.
351	00:26:43	00:26:49	Well, and if she was trying to clean off her right hand in this fountain she would have had to be in this position.
352	00:26:49	00:26:51	And he waited till her back was turned...
353	00:26:51	00:26:53	and came up behind her.
354	00:26:53	00:26:54	I found some more glass.
355	00:26:57	00:26:59	Looks polarized.
356	00:27:00	00:27:03	Well, lightbulb glass isn't polarized.
357	00:27:03	00:27:05	Eyeglasses are. Yeah.
358	00:27:05	00:27:07	You know, she was a black belt.
359	00:27:07	00:27:08	Maybe she fought back.
360	00:27:08	00:27:12	That would explain why she had defensive wounds and none of the other victims did.
361	00:27:21	00:27:23	Sorry about the no print results on the Mathers' case.
362	00:27:23	00:27:25	Make it up to me.
363	00:27:25	00:27:27	I got a new case. New bag.
364	00:28:10	00:28:13	It's only partial but I've got a hit off less.
365	00:28:13	00:28:15	Great.
366	00:28:18	00:28:21	Hey, you know that black fiber that Catherine pulled from Debbie Reston's hair?
367	00:28:22	00:28:22	Yeah.
368	00:28:23	00:28:23	It's trilobal.
369	00:28:24	00:28:26	Vehicle upholstery.
370	00:28:26	00:28:28	It's not from her car. Her upholstery is red.
371	00:28:28	00:28:29	That's good for us.
372	00:28:29	00:28:32	She was killed at the water fountain but the body was dumped at the library.
373	00:28:32	00:28:35	You can't carry a body in plain sight on campus even in at night.
374	00:28:35	00:28:40	Odds are decent we're looking at a fiber from the killer's vehicle.
375	00:28:43	00:28:45	Generic Chevy.
376	00:28:45	00:28:48	Well, that kind of narrows it down.
377	00:28:48	00:28:52	The glass on the left is not polarized.
378	00:28:52	00:28:54	There's not color change.
379	00:28:54	00:28:56	What, from the busted security light?
380	00:28:56	00:28:58	Yeah, the one found in the path.
381	00:28:58	00:28:59	Not the one found in her hand.
382	00:28:59	00:29:02	Okay, the guy broke the bulb on purpose.
383	00:29:02	00:29:04	Gives him an advantage-- cover of darkness.
384	00:29:04	00:29:08	I'll buy that, but the glass on the right was the one extracted from the cuts on her hand.
385	00:29:08	00:29:11	And it matches the glass that Catherine found near the water fountain.
386	00:29:11	00:29:13	Confirms that Debbie fought with her attacker.
387	00:29:13	00:29:17	Suspect's minus one point two five.
388	00:29:18	00:29:20	What is that, 20/80?
389	00:29:20	00:29:21	That's like half of mine.
390	00:29:21	00:29:23	It's not much of a correction.
391	00:29:23	00:29:28	Great. We're looking for a guy with a 20/80 prescription who drives a Chevy with black interior.
392	00:29:34	00:29:35	Hey.
393	00:29:35	00:29:37	Got your report from the feds.
394	00:29:38	00:29:39	Why did it come to you?
395	00:29:39	00:29:41	Because they returned the DNA evidence to me.
396	00:29:41	00:29:44	I took a look at the results.
397	00:29:44	00:29:45	Didn't think you'd mind.
398	00:29:45	00:29:48	I do.
399	00:29:48	00:29:51	All six hairs are a match to Mathers.
400	00:30:01	00:30:05	He raped and murdered Charlene Roth.
401	00:30:05	00:30:08	Dead bang. Airtight. Good night, John.
402	00:30:08	00:30:11	How are you coming with that twist tie, Greg?
403	00:30:11	00:30:12	The new case? Yeah.
404	00:30:12	00:30:13	Working on it.
405	00:30:13	00:30:15	Good. Keep working on it.
406	00:30:19	00:30:21	Slam dunk on Mathers.
407	00:30:22	00:30:23	Good.
408	00:30:23	00:30:26	The paint on Debbie Reston's hands...
409	00:30:26	00:30:28	Yeah?
410	00:30:28	00:30:31	...oil-based blue.
411	00:30:31	00:30:32	Oil-based?
412	00:30:33	00:30:35	That's for canvases, not railings.
413	00:30:35	00:30:38	Not only that, it was mixed with 30-weight motor oil.
414	00:30:39	00:30:42	Which isn't a component of any commercial paint.
415	00:30:42	00:30:44	As an additive however...
416	00:30:44	00:30:46	keeps paint from drying.
417	00:30:48	00:30:52	Okay... he knew what he was doing.
418	00:30:52	00:30:56	Expanding his window of opportunity.
419	00:30:57	00:30:59	Hello?
420	00:30:59	00:31:01	Hairs.
421	00:31:01	00:31:03	Hopefully from his paintbrush.
422	00:31:03	00:31:06	And the paint matches Western LVU shade of blue.
423	00:31:06	00:31:08	He knows a lot about paint.
424	00:31:08	00:31:10	He knows a lot about that campus.
425	00:31:10	00:31:12	I don't know what I can tell you.
426	00:31:12	00:31:14	I've only been here since '95.
427	00:31:14	00:31:19	Well, is there anyone in the art department who was here when the first murders took place?
428	00:31:19	00:31:21	A couple of the guys predate me.
429	00:31:21	00:31:23	I'll ask around.
430	00:31:23	00:31:26	Are any of these brushes made with badger hair?
431	00:31:26	00:31:28	We artists covet our brushes.
432	00:31:30	00:31:32	That's Russian blue squirrel...
433	00:31:32	00:31:35	Japanese synthetic... badger.
434	00:31:35	00:31:41	In the oil paint sample we collected we found both badger hair and nylon bristles.
435	00:31:41	00:31:48	Anyone who's studied art would never use nylon with oils unless they were using the paint for something else.
436	00:31:48	00:31:51	When brushes age, they shed hairs.
437	00:31:51	00:31:53	Then, if they used a nylon brush the next time...
438	00:31:53	00:31:56	Say I wanted a badger hair paintbrush-- where would I buy one?
439	00:31:57	00:31:59	Student Union sells them.
440	00:31:59	00:32:01	Most art stores.
441	00:32:01	00:32:03	You can get them cheaper on the Internet.
442	00:32:06	00:32:08	Sorry. I was admiring your frames.
443	00:32:08	00:32:10	Nice.
444	00:32:14	00:32:19	The results are back on the zip tie you removed from Debbie Reston's wrists.
445	00:32:20	00:32:25	No foreign epithelials but I did find an errant hair DNA tag still attached.
446	00:32:25	00:32:27	It's not Debbie Reston's.
447	00:32:27	00:32:30	Catherine asked me to cross-check everything with the old cases.
448	00:32:30	00:32:33	It actually belongs to Janet Kent.
449	00:32:33	00:32:34	Janet Kent-- the first victim?
450	00:32:34	00:32:35	I know.
451	00:32:35	00:32:45	So Janet Kent's killer saved some of her hair and planted it on Debbie Reston 15 years later on the night that John Mathers was set to be executed.
452	00:32:45	00:32:46	John Mathers is the copycat.
453	00:32:46	00:32:48	Yeah.
454	00:32:48	00:32:51	And the original killer's still out there playing a really twisted game.
455	00:34:03	00:34:04	Oh. Hey.
456	00:34:05	00:34:07	Mathers' execution's back on.
457	00:34:07	00:34:10	The Roths asked me to sit with them.
458	00:34:10	00:34:12	Is that a good idea?
459	00:34:12	00:34:14	I just need to do it.
460	00:34:14	00:34:16	Why?
461	00:34:16	00:34:18	It's like your first autopsy...
462	00:34:18	00:34:19	your first murdered child.
463	00:34:20	00:34:22	You can make it through that you can keep doing this work.
464	00:34:22	00:34:26	All the paints match all the victims except for Charlene Roth.
465	00:34:26	00:34:32	See, being capable of matching paint samples that are 15 years apart that's why I keep doing this work.
466	00:34:32	00:34:36	Well, that's the difference between you and me.
467	00:34:36	00:34:37	Hey. Hey.
468	00:34:37	00:34:39	Dean of the Art School came up with a name.
469	00:34:39	00:34:40	A Cody Lewis.
470	00:34:40	00:34:45	He was a grad student at WLVU in the late '80s same time the three girls were murdered.
471	00:34:45	00:34:48	He left just after the Roth case for a post-doc in Louisiana.
472	00:34:48	00:34:50	Where is he now?
473	00:34:50	00:34:51	WLVU since September.
474	00:34:51	00:34:53	He's an assistant professor there.
475	00:34:57	00:35:00	So you like to paint dead girls?
476	00:35:00	00:35:03	I paint what I feel.
477	00:35:03	00:35:05	Yeah, sure.
478	00:35:05	00:35:07	You know, you're an artist.
479	00:35:07	00:35:10	So back in '87 when you painted this girl what were you feeling?
480	00:35:10	00:35:13	That you wanted her to die?
481	00:35:15	00:35:19	What's the subject matter this week?
482	00:35:19	00:35:21	More dead girls?
483	00:35:21	00:35:23	I haven't been doing a lot of painting lately.
484	00:35:23	00:35:25	Uh-huh.
485	00:35:25	00:35:30	So it's just a coincidence that another coed gets murdered right after you show up in Vegas, right?
486	00:35:30	00:35:34	Listen, I painted that 15 years ago.
487	00:35:34	00:35:36	Right after that second girl was murdered...
488	00:35:36	00:35:38	Marjorie something.
489	00:35:39	00:35:40	Really affected me.
490	00:35:40	00:35:41	Affected everyone.
491	00:35:41	00:35:43	Yeah, but it affected you more.
492	00:35:43	00:35:45	Because you knew the first victim.
493	00:35:45	00:35:48	Janet Kent.
494	00:35:48	00:35:50	Yeah, I knew Janet.
495	00:35:50	00:35:52	Come on, Cody, man.
496	00:35:52	00:35:54	You two had a thing.
497	00:35:54	00:35:55	We had a date.
498	00:35:55	00:35:57	I took her to a Springsteen show.
499	00:35:57	00:36:01	We had drinks afterwards and that was it.
500	00:36:01	00:36:03	So what, did she reject you?
501	00:36:03	00:36:08	Did she give you the Cody, we can still be friends?
502	00:36:08	00:36:09	That speech?
503	00:36:09	00:36:11	No.
504	00:36:11	00:36:12	Never got that far.
505	00:36:12	00:36:19	I was just wondering because some guys can't take no for an answer.
506	00:36:19	00:36:21	But that's not you, right?
507	00:36:32	00:36:34	Okay, I'm getting this to Trace.
508	00:36:35	00:36:37	Hey, check out the vehicle's upholstery.
509	00:36:37	00:36:40	It's black and it's a Chevy...
510	00:36:40	00:36:41	We got nothing.
511	00:36:41	00:36:43	Nobody cleans a car this good.
512	00:36:43	00:36:46	There is no evidence that Debbie Reston was transported in this vehicle.
513	00:36:47	00:36:49	Still doesn't rule out Cody Lewis as a suspect.
514	00:36:49	00:36:53	You got to wonder when a guy gives it up this easily.
515	00:36:53	00:36:58	Prints, DNA, his car...
516	00:36:58	00:36:59	Yeah, well...
517	00:36:59	00:37:04	maybe he's thinks he's some kind of smart guy you know, covering all the bases.
518	00:37:04	00:37:06	Or maybe he didn't do it.
519	00:37:06	00:37:08	What's that?
520	00:37:08	00:37:12	His prints don't match the partial on the Debbie Reston trash bag.
521	00:37:15	00:37:17	Wonderful.
522	00:37:17	00:37:18	Thanks.
523	00:37:22	00:37:25	Ammonia... in case anyone starts to feel...
524	00:37:25	00:37:26	unsteady.
525	00:38:21	00:38:25	I keep racking my brain going over these unsolved murder cases.
526	00:38:25	00:38:29	And I keep coming back to the fact that they're 15 years apart.
527	00:38:29	00:38:33	That means he's either out of town or in the joint.
528	00:38:33	00:38:37	Why wouldn't he take his business to some other college if it was only about young girls?
529	00:38:37	00:38:38	It's got to be personal.
530	00:38:38	00:38:41	He wanted to kill those girls.
531	00:39:44	00:39:48	I mean, I don't know much about bugs but most animals hunt in their own backyard.
532	00:39:48	00:39:50	True of insects as well.
533	00:39:50	00:39:51	You know why?
534	00:39:51	00:39:53	It's where they feel most comfortable.
535	00:39:53	00:39:55	And where they can blend in the best.
536	00:39:55	00:39:59	This guy had ties to Western LVU.
537	00:39:59	00:40:03	He paints a railing on a campus walkway.
538	00:40:03	00:40:05	I tried it; took me about five minutes.
539	00:40:05	00:40:08	My guys were all over that school.
540	00:40:08	00:40:10	Nobody remembers seeing anything.
541	00:40:10	00:40:13	Probably because there wasn't much to see.
542	00:40:13	00:40:15	He must've looked as though he belonged.
543	00:40:15	00:40:18	Like the insects, he blended in.
544	00:40:19	00:40:21	Yeah.
545	00:40:23	00:40:25	You off the clock?
546	00:40:25	00:40:27	I guess.
547	00:40:38	00:40:41	He's going to kill again.
548	00:40:43	00:40:45	Yeah.
549	00:40:45	00:40:51	And all we've got is a partial fingerprint and an MO that may lead us in the right direction.
550	00:40:51	00:40:59	You know sometimes in this job I'd rather be lucky than good.
551	00:40:59	00:41:01	Maybe next time we'll get lucky.
552	00:41:01	00:41:03	I don't believe in luck.
553	00:41:03	00:41:12	My only real purpose is to be smarter than the bad guys to find the evidence that they didn't know they left behind and make sense of it all.
554	00:41:12	00:41:16	It makes me very uncomfortable to realize that this guy...
555	00:41:16	00:41:19	may be smarter than me.
