0,00:00:01,00:00:03,GRISSOM (echoing): The details.
1,00:00:03,00:00:05,WILLOWS (echoing): Terrifying... I think Malibu Barbie did it.
2,00:00:05,00:00:09,"GRISSOM: Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face."
3,00:00:09,00:00:13,'Cause this is a perfect half-inch-scale model of the room.
4,00:00:13,00:00:16,HODGES: Three different views of the same dead doll.
5,00:00:16,00:00:22,"WILLOWS: Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's 13 of them."
6,00:00:22,00:00:27,MAN: I found a common element in all four miniatures: bleach.
7,00:00:27,00:00:39,"NEWSWOMAN: ...stunned by the death of former top-ranked junior middleweight Lorenzo ""Happy"" Morales, whose body was found floating in a pool late last night at the Sugarcane Ranch Brothel in Bryant County."
8,00:00:39,00:00:47,"Morales, best known for his ability to take a punch, was reportedly attempting a comeback to boxing."
9,00:00:47,00:00:51,"LVPD is investigating the incident, which they are treating as a homicide."
10,00:00:51,00:00:53,(laughs)

12,00:00:58,00:01:01,(giggling)
13,00:01:02,00:01:05,(pop music playing over speakers)
14,00:01:15,00:01:19,(gasping)
15,00:01:22,00:01:25,(panicky panting)
16,00:01:25,00:01:27,(horn beeping)
17,00:01:28,00:01:30,(neon buzzing)
18,00:01:32,00:01:35,(techno music playing)
19,00:02:19,00:02:21,(knocking at door)
20,00:02:21,00:02:25,"Hey, boss, heard you got a lead on another one of the Dell fosters."
21,00:02:25,00:02:27,Just got an e-mail.
22,00:02:27,00:02:29,Raymond Dell.
23,00:02:30,00:02:34,Died two years ago in some bizarre back hoe incident in Rapid City.
24,00:02:34,00:02:36,Okay.
25,00:02:36,00:02:38,That's good.
26,00:02:38,00:02:39,One less suspect.
27,00:02:39,00:02:41,(phone ringing)
28,00:02:41,00:02:42,Grissom.
29,00:02:43,00:02:47,BRASS: Court order for another Dell kid in Old Henderson-- the 1621 Water Street-- it just came through.
30,00:02:47,00:02:49,Are you up for a house call?
31,00:02:49,00:02:51,I'll meet you there.
32,00:02:53,00:02:56,"BRASS: So, we've been trying to contact Mr. Dell for a couple of weeks."
33,00:02:56,00:02:58,Have you heard from him?
34,00:02:58,00:03:00,"No, but that's probably 'cause the rent's due."
35,00:03:00,00:03:04,"See, around here, we mostly have the kind of tenants who don't like to pay their bills much."
36,00:03:04,00:03:06,(clears throat) This is the one.
37,00:03:06,00:03:07,I wonder why.
38,00:03:07,00:03:08,"Trevor Dell, open up."
39,00:03:08,00:03:10,Las Vegas Police.
40,00:03:12,00:03:15,MAN: You got my authority to use deadly force.
41,00:03:15,00:03:17,"Hey, shut up and stand back."
42,00:03:17,00:03:19,(door thudding open)
43,00:03:19,00:03:21,BRASS: Anybody home?
44,00:03:21,00:03:22,This is the police.
45,00:03:22,00:03:25,Somebody likes it cold.
46,00:03:26,00:03:29,"Vegas in May, plus global warming."
47,00:03:36,00:03:39,"Hey, Gil, we got a body."
48,00:03:39,00:03:41,(phone beeps)
49,00:03:41,00:03:43,"Yeah, Control, this is Jim Brass."
50,00:03:43,00:03:48,"I got a 419 at 1621 Water Street, Apartment 2B."
51,00:03:50,00:03:52,"What, you lose your interest in dead bodies?"
52,00:03:52,00:03:53,No.
53,00:03:53,00:03:56,But I'm afraid the Miniature Killer was here first.
54,00:04:32,00:04:35,(indistinct background radio communication)
55,00:04:36,00:04:42,"Two distinct lacerations-- one on the forehead, one on the back of the skull."
56,00:04:42,00:04:46,Lividity is fixed.
57,00:04:46,00:04:48,Decomp is pretty well developed.
58,00:04:49,00:04:51,Air-conditioning would have slowed that and accelerated mummification.
59,00:04:51,00:04:53,Body's been sealed in the apartment.
60,00:04:53,00:04:55,There's no insect activity.
61,00:04:55,00:04:59,GRISSOM: So much for T.O.D. Could be a couple of days to a few weeks.
62,00:04:59,00:05:00,Miniature Killer?
63,00:05:02,00:05:03,(sighs)
64,00:05:03,00:05:05,It's hard to say.
65,00:05:05,00:05:07,Haven't found a miniature of the scene yet.
66,00:05:07,00:05:08,Just this.
67,00:05:08,00:05:10,Clothes match.
68,00:05:10,00:05:17,"The, uh, vic's a P.T. nurse, but there's no blood on the doll, and it's not posed like the body."
69,00:05:17,00:05:20,"Bleach at the scene, just like the others."
70,00:05:20,00:05:24,Maybe this one wasn't planned.
71,00:05:24,00:05:32,"Maybe the killer has to make the miniature after the fact, which is why it's so cold in here, to preserve the body."
72,00:05:32,00:05:34,GRISSOM: I don't think we can rule anything out.
73,00:05:34,00:05:36,"It's all yours, my dear."
74,00:05:44,00:05:46,(humming)
75,00:06:40,00:06:45,Comparing construction materials of the new doll to see if it's the same work as the others?
76,00:06:45,00:06:46,(beep) Yeah.
77,00:06:46,00:06:47,Is there any doubt?
78,00:06:47,00:06:49,I live by the Uncertainty Principle.
79,00:06:49,00:06:52,The mere act of observing a phenomenon changes its nature.
80,00:06:52,00:06:55,"So in trying to catch the killer, we've changed his behavior."
81,00:06:55,00:06:58,I'm certain we have.
82,00:07:04,00:07:06,(squeak)
83,00:07:08,00:07:09,What?
84,00:07:10,00:07:11,A fingerprint.
85,00:07:11,00:07:16,"Well, there was no physical trace on any of the other dolls or the miniatures."
86,00:07:16,00:07:18,Maybe he's finally gotten careless.
87,00:07:48,00:07:50,"WOMAN: Uh, Natalie?"
88,00:07:50,00:07:51,Davis? Natalie Davis?
89,00:07:52,00:07:52,"You're next, hon."
90,00:07:53,00:07:54,WOMAN: Ooh-ee.
91,00:07:54,00:07:55,Izzy Delancy.
92,00:07:56,00:07:57,"Hoity-toity, hmm?"
93,00:07:57,00:07:59,"It's a real shame what happened to him, huh?"
94,00:08:00,00:08:02,Were you there for all that nonsense?
95,00:08:03,00:08:05,"Too bad, huh?"
96,00:08:05,00:08:07,(laughing)
97,00:08:07,00:08:09,(sighs)
98,00:08:09,00:08:12,You're a little lawbreaker.
99,00:08:12,00:08:17,"Says here, you, uh, prefer to be paid in cash."
100,00:08:17,00:08:19,"You like working off the books, huh?"
101,00:08:19,00:08:22,"Good ol' Uncle Sam probably not too happy about that, huh?"
102,00:08:22,00:08:23,That's...
103,00:08:23,00:08:27,because... I-I...
104,00:08:27,00:08:30,"(tauntingly): Uh, uh, uh, ooh, uh, uh."
105,00:08:30,00:08:31,(guffawing)
106,00:08:31,00:08:34,"You speak English, you got all your papers."
107,00:08:34,00:08:36,"No, fine. It's fine."
108,00:08:36,00:08:40,"But in all seriousness, you wouldn't mind having your fingerprints done?"
109,00:08:40,00:08:45,"See, we were lucky enough to get a contract for the municipal buildings downtown."
110,00:08:45,00:08:48,"You know, mayor's office, police department."
111,00:08:48,00:08:49,Yeah.
112,00:08:49,00:08:55,"But, you know, they require a background check for anyone going to work in that building, even temps."
113,00:08:55,00:08:56,Sure.
114,00:08:56,00:08:58,That'd be okay.
115,00:08:58,00:09:01,Yeah...
116,00:09:03,00:09:14,"Listen, hon, you seem like a real nice girl, real nice, but we're called Platinum Maids for a reason."
117,00:09:14,00:09:15,I-I just don't see the sparkle.
118,00:09:15,00:09:17,No.
119,00:09:17,00:09:19,"No, I'm very good."
120,00:09:19,00:09:22,And I have exceptional attention to detail.
121,00:09:22,00:09:26,You clean in between the blinds?
122,00:09:26,00:09:27,No.
123,00:09:27,00:09:29,More like memory.
124,00:09:29,00:09:34,I can see a room one time and remember where everything is.
125,00:09:34,00:09:36,After just one time?
126,00:09:36,00:09:38,Uh-huh.
127,00:09:38,00:09:40,Okay.
128,00:09:40,00:09:45,Describe the reception area.
129,00:09:45,00:09:47,There's a lavender orchid on the reception desk.
130,00:09:47,00:09:49,It's top bloom is about to open.
131,00:09:49,00:09:52,A glass coffee cup with a chip on the edge.
132,00:09:52,00:09:55,A half inch of coffee still in the cup.
133,00:09:55,00:10:00,"Cut glass bowl full of chocolate Kisses-- two gold, one purple."
134,00:10:00,00:10:03,A glass vase with a rose etched in the glass.
135,00:10:03,00:10:06,Three leaves etched on its stalk.
136,00:10:08,00:10:10,You sit tight.
137,00:10:10,00:10:12,I got some choices for you.
138,00:10:14,00:10:17,"(water pouring, camera shutter beeping)"
139,00:10:26,00:10:31,"(camera beeping, clicking)"
140,00:10:34,00:10:36,(beeping and clicking)
141,00:10:36,00:10:37,(squeak)
142,00:11:03,00:11:08,BROWN: Victim's cell phone and I.M. logs show no activity for the past 12 days.
143,00:11:08,00:11:11,"So far, that's the best I can do for a time of death."
144,00:11:11,00:11:17,"According to the doc, C.O.D. was cerebral hemorrhage due to multiple blunt force trauma."
145,00:11:17,00:11:21,SIDLE: The head injuries are consistent with the blood stains on the sink and the wall behind it.
146,00:11:21,00:11:23,It does suggest a struggle.
147,00:11:23,00:11:24,(glass shattering)
148,00:11:26,00:11:29,It's... kind of up close and personal for this killer.
149,00:11:29,00:11:34,"Hodges ran fabric, paint, glue, and plastic samples of the Trevor doll."
150,00:11:34,00:11:36,The materials were consistent with the previous Minis.
151,00:11:36,00:11:38,No luck with that print?
152,00:11:38,00:11:40,"It was only a partial, not enough to put through AFIS."
153,00:11:40,00:11:42,But there were epithelials in the print.
154,00:11:42,00:11:43,Wendy's running DNA.
155,00:11:53,00:11:55,Hello there. Can I help you?
156,00:11:58,00:12:01,I need to order a special part.
157,00:12:01,00:12:04,"Well, why don't you just check out our spaceship isle."
158,00:12:04,00:12:05,Yeah.
159,00:12:05,00:12:08,I'll be right with you after I help this little fellow over here.
160,00:12:11,00:12:14,"Look, you really need to buy these polyhedral dice."
161,00:12:14,00:12:16,Just in case.
162,00:12:16,00:12:18,"You're always losing them, man."
163,00:12:27,00:12:29,I just come from the police.
164,00:12:29,00:12:32,They showed me your miniatures and they showed me some pictures of some dead people.
165,00:12:32,00:12:35,The cops know I helped you put some of that stuff together.
166,00:12:36,00:12:41,"They know I delivered that package to the old lady's house, like you asked me to."
167,00:12:41,00:12:42,"They think I killed, I killed all those people."
168,00:12:43,00:12:44,You didn't?
169,00:12:44,00:12:46,"Natalie, did you kill them?"
170,00:12:48,00:12:49,Did you kill those people?
171,00:12:50,00:12:52,Yes.
172,00:12:54,00:12:56,Why?
173,00:12:57,00:12:59,"They're going to put you in jail, honey."
174,00:13:00,00:13:02,(sighs)
175,00:13:06,00:13:08,Unless there's something else?
176,00:13:10,00:13:12,If you had a good reason...
177,00:13:12,00:13:14,they'll listen to that.
178,00:13:16,00:13:18,Raymundo...
179,00:13:19,00:13:22,...did he put his hands on you?
180,00:13:22,00:13:24,Yes...
181,00:13:24,00:13:27,that smell...
182,00:13:27,00:13:30,And the old lady?
183,00:13:30,00:13:33,And that pervert rock star?
184,00:13:33,00:13:36,If they done something to you just tell me what it was.
185,00:13:41,00:13:43,Honey...
186,00:13:43,00:13:46,I know there's some people out there that deserve killin'...
187,00:13:46,00:13:52,"and you... you had good reason to kill 'em, right?"
188,00:13:52,00:13:54,Yes.
189,00:13:54,00:13:56,All right.
190,00:14:02,00:14:04,I want you to listen to me.
191,00:14:04,00:14:07,What you've done is done.
192,00:14:07,00:14:09,I can't fix that.
193,00:14:09,00:14:12,But I can still take care of you.
194,00:14:12,00:14:15,I ain't going to let the police get you.
195,00:14:15,00:14:20,But you got to promise me you won't kill nobody else.
196,00:14:21,00:14:25,Promise me you'll be a good girl.
197,00:14:25,00:14:28,(child-like): Your special girl?
198,00:14:28,00:14:29,That's right.
199,00:14:29,00:14:31,My special girl.
200,00:14:31,00:14:34,I promise.
201,00:14:43,00:14:45,You were the one thing I thought I'd done right.
202,00:15:19,00:15:24,GRISSOM: I found a thriving miniature hobbyist community on line.
203,00:15:24,00:15:29,"Sites where people meet, chat, exchange building tips, list stores they shop in."
204,00:15:29,00:15:30,So that's why you built this thing?
205,00:15:30,00:15:32,I mean...
206,00:15:32,00:15:34,other than to creep us all out?
207,00:15:34,00:15:39,"Items like Trevor Dell's metal bracelet are difficult to make, even for skilled craftsmen."
208,00:15:39,00:15:43,I'm trying to find people who specialize in miniature metal work.
209,00:15:45,00:15:49,"SIMMS: Hey, I got DNA off the Trevor doll."
210,00:15:49,00:15:51,There were two contributors: the vic and an unknown.
211,00:15:51,00:15:53,"There was nothing in CODIS, but..."
212,00:15:53,00:15:55,the unknown was XX.
213,00:15:57,00:15:59,The Miniature Killer's a woman?
214,00:16:01,00:16:04,Female serial killers are rare enough.
215,00:16:04,00:16:06,Delusional psychosis in women...
216,00:16:06,00:16:07,rarer still.
217,00:16:07,00:16:11,"Well, ""female"" cuts the list down a little bit."
218,00:16:11,00:16:14,We could also narrow it down even further by cross-referencing the dates that Trevor lived with Ernie.
219,00:16:14,00:16:18,"I mean, that's got to be enough to get the foster records released, right?"
220,00:16:18,00:16:23,"Family court judge was explicit: ""No fishing expeditions."" We need to go in with a name."
221,00:16:23,00:16:26,(beeping)
222,00:16:28,00:16:31,Come on down to Schuster's Hobby Shop.
223,00:16:31,00:16:33,A whole world awaits you.
224,00:16:38,00:16:40,GRISSOM: I'll be back.
225,00:16:40,00:16:44,I have to go see the Shadowcaster of the Forgotten Realms.
226,00:16:52,00:16:56,"Unless the female killer was an Amazon, I kind of doubt a guy like this was just..."
227,00:16:56,00:16:57,beat around his own bathroom.
228,00:16:57,00:16:59,You have another theory?
229,00:16:59,00:17:02,"In the Penny Garden case, the victim was..."
230,00:17:02,00:17:07,"poisoned, then died falling out a window after going into convulsions."
231,00:17:07,00:17:09,Right.
232,00:17:09,00:17:18,"In the Barbara Tallman case, the method of murder was gassing but was disguised by potential poisoning and suffocation."
233,00:17:18,00:17:19,You think I overlooked something?
234,00:17:19,00:17:21,"You know, I asked for an expanded tox panel."
235,00:17:22,00:17:24,It came back clean as a whistle. Well...
236,00:17:24,00:17:26,take a look at this.
237,00:17:26,00:17:29,That little round spot...
238,00:17:29,00:17:31,is that discoloration consistent with decomp?
239,00:17:31,00:17:33,Maybe not.
240,00:17:33,00:17:34,And idea what it is? No.
241,00:17:34,00:17:36,But I can find out.
242,00:17:36,00:17:38,"GRISSOM: Hello, Art."
243,00:17:38,00:17:39,"Well, hey, Dr. Grissom."
244,00:17:39,00:17:40,"How's the, uh, miniature going?"
245,00:17:40,00:17:42,"Coming along, thank you."
246,00:17:42,00:17:44,We found another one.
247,00:17:44,00:17:45,"Oh, man."
248,00:17:45,00:17:46,He struck again?
249,00:17:46,00:17:48,I think so.
250,00:17:48,00:17:52,"By any chance, did you make this bracelet?"
251,00:17:54,00:17:56,"Oh, yeah, I made that."
252,00:17:56,00:17:57,"For a chick, man."
253,00:17:58,00:17:59,Uh...
254,00:17:59,00:18:01,let's see...
255,00:18:01,00:18:03,Natalie.
256,00:18:03,00:18:05,She have a last name?
257,00:18:05,00:18:06,"Uh, I-I didn't think to write it down."
258,00:18:06,00:18:08,"""Paid cash."
259,00:18:08,00:18:12,"Call cell phone when ready."" It's the same cell number we already have."
260,00:18:13,00:18:14,Do you remember what she looked like?
261,00:18:14,00:18:15,"Late 20s, early 30s..."
262,00:18:15,00:18:17,She's about yay high.
263,00:18:17,00:18:19,"Uh, brown hair."
264,00:18:19,00:18:21,"Uh, she's kind of a Skinny chick."
265,00:18:21,00:18:22,Weird.
266,00:18:22,00:18:27,Weird how? I got guys who come in here trying to recreate Civil War battles hoping for a different outcome.
267,00:18:27,00:18:31,I get the desperate housewives who are trying to build the perfect Thanksgiving dinner.
268,00:18:31,00:18:36,"Control freaks with social problems that's my bread and butter, but, uh, this chick, she had..."
269,00:18:36,00:18:37,"crazy eyes, you know."
270,00:18:37,00:18:39,Was that the last time you saw her?
271,00:18:39,00:18:41,You know what?
272,00:18:41,00:18:43,She came in a few days ago.
273,00:18:43,00:18:45,She... yeah!
274,00:18:45,00:18:46,She bought one of these.
275,00:18:48,00:18:50,Battery powered micro-motor?
276,00:18:50,00:18:52,You just attach that to anything you want to animate.
277,00:18:53,00:18:54,"Just like, uh..."
278,00:18:54,00:18:56,"like this, see."
279,00:18:59,00:19:01,No one ever wins.
280,00:20:16,00:20:21,ROBBINS: The nuclear streaming indicates that Trevor Dell was subjected to a significant electrical current.
281,00:20:22,00:20:26,"The shock must have sent him into convulsions, resulting in several impact injuries."
282,00:20:26,00:20:27,He was electrocuted?!
283,00:20:28,00:20:29,From what?
284,00:20:29,00:20:32,"If I could tell you that, you'd be out of a job."
285,00:20:34,00:20:36,All the outlets in the bathroom are dead.
286,00:20:38,00:20:40,Must be on a separate circuit than the lights.
287,00:20:42,00:20:43,I just reset the breaker.
288,00:20:43,00:20:45,That do the trick?
289,00:20:45,00:20:47,(beeping)
290,00:20:47,00:20:49,We're hot.
291,00:20:55,00:20:57,What you got?
292,00:20:57,00:20:59,Possible burn mark on the tile.
293,00:20:59,00:21:03,"If this is where Trevor's foot grounded out, he must've been at the sink when he got zapped."
294,00:21:06,00:21:08,The outlet doesn't look scorched.
295,00:21:13,00:21:14,Looks like some burned skin.
296,00:21:14,00:21:17,The sink is still damp.
297,00:21:17,00:21:19,"Hey, hit that crack."
298,00:21:21,00:21:23,(beeping)
299,00:21:25,00:21:29,I think we may have found the Mini Killer's booby trap.
300,00:21:30,00:21:32,"(electrical buzzing, Trevor moaning)"
301,00:21:38,00:21:41,Hot wire's touching one of the metal brackets that's holding up the sink.
302,00:21:41,00:21:46,"WILLOWS: Sink is cracked, water pours in, touches the bracket..."
303,00:21:46,00:21:48,Trevor touches the water...
304,00:21:48,00:21:49,zap.
305,00:21:49,00:21:51,You can see where it's been rigged.
306,00:21:51,00:21:59,Whoever tapped into this power line must've gained access from the apartment on the other side of this wall.
307,00:21:59,00:22:01,You're saying the killer's the next door neighbor?
308,00:22:14,00:22:15,(knocking)
309,00:22:17,00:22:19,LVPD! Open the door!
310,00:22:33,00:22:35,"Hey, here's another one for you."
311,00:22:35,00:22:39,"You sure, uh, get a lot of packages..."
312,00:23:08,00:23:09,Oh!
313,00:23:09,00:23:11,"Oh, God!"
314,00:23:16,00:23:18,The big guy's a wannabe composer.
315,00:23:18,00:23:20,Quit his day job to write the nextDreamgirls.
316,00:23:20,00:23:24,"Anyway, he didn't pay his bills and the power company shut off his lights."
317,00:23:24,00:23:27,So the genius steals power from his neighbor and ends up electrifying Trevor's sink.
318,00:23:28,00:23:30,"Yeah, another weird tragedy for the Dell family."
319,00:23:30,00:23:32,"Doesn't explain what that doll was doing there, though."
320,00:23:33,00:23:34,"Well, the guy liked action figures."
321,00:23:34,00:23:38,"Maybe his sister, the Miniature Killer, gave it to him as a gift."
322,00:23:46,00:23:47,GRISSOM (on phone): Grissom.
323,00:23:47,00:23:50,"Hey, Grissom, it's Sofia."
324,00:23:50,00:23:53,"""Female Dell foster child, first name Natalie"" was finally specific enough."
325,00:23:53,00:23:57,Family Court just ordered CPS to release her records.
326,00:23:59,00:24:02,"Sorry, did I totally flake on an appointment?"
327,00:24:02,00:24:04,We're not with Social Services.
328,00:24:04,00:24:08,We're here to ask you about a foster child you had a number of years ago.
329,00:24:08,00:24:09,"Oh, geez. You can try."
330,00:24:09,00:24:10,"We've had about 60. Yeah, honey?"
331,00:24:10,00:24:13,"You said we could watchDora, Mm-hmm. but Simon's watching soccer."
332,00:24:13,00:24:18,"Well, Simon has TV privileges until 4:00, so tell him (chuckles) that now it's your turn."
333,00:24:18,00:24:21,"Ha-ha! Nicely please, thank you."
334,00:24:21,00:24:23,Her birth name was Natalie Davis.
335,00:24:23,00:24:27,Mm-hmm. She would've been about seven when she came to you in 1982.
336,00:24:27,00:24:29,"Oh, '82. My God..."
337,00:24:29,00:24:31,Let's see.
338,00:24:31,00:24:32,Let's take a look.
339,00:24:32,00:24:33,What did you get?
340,00:24:34,00:24:36,Oh! Good for you.
341,00:24:36,00:24:37,Congratulations.
342,00:24:40,00:24:42,Do you take a photo of every child?
343,00:24:43,00:24:44,"Every single one, their first night here."
344,00:24:44,00:24:47,I just feel like it gives them a sense of belonging right away.
345,00:24:47,00:24:51,Most of them come to us so damaged they don't know what it's like to belong to anything.
346,00:24:51,00:24:53,Here we are.
347,00:24:53,00:24:56,"Oh, Natalie."
348,00:24:56,00:25:00,"Yeah, shy as anything until I tried to do her laundry and then she screamed her little head off."
349,00:25:00,00:25:01,"Do you use bleach, Mrs. Wetzel?"
350,00:25:01,00:25:04,Have you ever even seen a load of kids' laundry?
351,00:25:04,00:25:06,Of course I use bleach.
352,00:25:06,00:25:08,Excuse me a second.
353,00:25:09,00:25:13,"According to Child Services, she only stayed with you a week."
354,00:25:13,00:25:15,Do you remember why?
355,00:25:15,00:25:20,"Yeah, a couple of nights into her stay, she climbed up to the top bunk and pushed another little girl out."
356,00:25:20,00:25:25,"Of course we talked to her about it, but she did it again the very next night, almost broke her collarbone."
357,00:25:25,00:25:28,So you just sent her back?
358,00:25:30,00:25:35,"After a few dozen kids, you get real good at knowing the difference between damaged and broken."
359,00:25:35,00:25:38,And Natalie was broken.
360,00:25:52,00:25:54,(low whirring)
361,00:26:01,00:26:03,(sharp thudding)
362,00:26:26,00:26:32,"CATHERINE: ""Great Rainone and His Little Bisque Doll."" Oh, that looks like the doll images from the Miniatures."
363,00:26:32,00:26:34,What's a bisque?
364,00:26:34,00:26:36,Fired unglazed pottery.
365,00:26:36,00:26:39,"Her biological father was Christopher Davis, a ventriloquist."
366,00:26:39,00:26:43,A grown man who sticks his hand up the back of a doll and speaks like a girl.
367,00:26:43,00:26:45,Sounds healthy.
368,00:26:45,00:26:47,I Googled him.
369,00:26:51,00:26:54,Who's Chloe? Natalie's younger sister.
370,00:26:54,00:26:57,"1981, she fell out of a tree house and died."
371,00:26:57,00:26:59,But her father's still alive.
372,00:26:59,00:27:01,And still performing.
373,00:27:02,00:27:04,"So how do you feel today, Chloe?"
374,00:27:04,00:27:05,"(falsetto voice): I'm not doing so good, Daddy."
375,00:27:06,00:27:07,"Well there, what's the matter, doll face?"
376,00:27:07,00:27:10,"Well, I feel like a hobo."
377,00:27:10,00:27:11,A hobo?
378,00:27:11,00:27:14,Now you know what that stands for don't ya?
379,00:27:14,00:27:17,"That stands for ""homeward bound."" But, I ain't got no home, Daddy."
380,00:27:17,00:27:19,"Well now, that's silly."
381,00:27:19,00:27:21,"Chloe, everybody's got a home. Where do you live?"
382,00:27:21,00:27:23,I live in a box.
383,00:27:23,00:27:24,In a box?
384,00:27:24,00:27:27,A box that's giving me a pain in my sawdust.
385,00:27:27,00:27:30,(florid piano intro) A pain in your sawdust?
386,00:28:11,00:28:13,(scattered applause)
387,00:28:19,00:28:22,"Okay, we're in a David Lynch movie."
388,00:28:22,00:28:25,Where's the dwarf?
389,00:28:52,00:28:55,"Yeah, that was my other daughter."
390,00:28:57,00:29:03,"So, being a performer and a parent had to have been hard at times."
391,00:29:03,00:29:05,"Well, my folks were in vaudeville."
392,00:29:05,00:29:07,It wasn't hard until my wife passed away.
393,00:29:07,00:29:13,Natalie was six and Chloe was four.
394,00:29:14,00:29:17,"It was, um, pepper and salt."
395,00:29:17,00:29:19,Darkness and light.
396,00:29:19,00:29:22,"Within the year, my whole family was just..."
397,00:29:22,00:29:25,Poof. Gone.
398,00:29:25,00:29:27,What happened?
399,00:29:30,00:29:33,"Can I tell the story, Daddy?"
400,00:29:33,00:29:35,"Sure, sweetheart."
401,00:29:40,00:29:42,It was a sunny day in June.
402,00:29:42,00:29:50,And my sister who couldn't hold a tune was playing with me in our house in the tree...
403,00:29:50,00:29:51,"CHLOE: Hi, Daddy."
404,00:29:51,00:29:52,"RAINONE: Hey, Chloe."
405,00:29:59,00:30:03,(screams) CHLOE DOLL: I fell to the ground with an awful sound.
406,00:30:03,00:30:13,A puddle of blood as big as the sea was all that was left of dear old me.
407,00:30:23,00:30:25,CATHERINE: Had the girls been fighting?
408,00:30:25,00:30:26,Chloe would never fight.
409,00:30:26,00:30:30,How did Natalie deal with it?
410,00:30:30,00:30:32,I don't know.
411,00:30:32,00:30:34,It was hard on both of us.
412,00:30:50,00:30:55,"I tried for a while, but I just couldn't handle it."
413,00:30:57,00:31:00,I had to give her up.
414,00:32:24,00:32:28,The Great Rainone is in great denial.
415,00:32:28,00:32:31,"Of course, losing a child at the hands of another could do that to you."
416,00:32:32,00:32:36,"You do agree that Natalie killed Chloe, right?"
417,00:32:36,00:32:39,"Yeah, I was just wondering what it must've looked like to her."
418,00:33:02,00:33:05,(elevator bell dings)
419,00:33:51,00:33:53,(car alarm beeps off)
420,00:33:55,00:33:57,Sara?
421,00:34:20,00:34:21,(phone beeps)
422,00:34:21,00:34:23,"Control, this is Jim Brass."
423,00:34:23,00:34:27,"Yeah, we found Sara Sidle's car, but she's missing."
424,00:34:27,00:34:28,There's no sign of her.
425,00:34:32,00:34:34,Looks like an abduction.
426,00:34:35,00:34:38,(phone ringing)
427,00:34:40,00:34:42,"Come on, Sara, pick up."
428,00:34:42,00:34:44,Please pick up.
429,00:34:47,00:34:49,Who was in my office while I was gone?
430,00:34:49,00:34:52,No one. Just some girl from janitorial.
431,00:34:52,00:34:54,"She went in, vacuumed, emptied out the trash."
432,00:34:54,00:34:57,That's all.
433,00:34:58,00:35:01,SANDERS: The doll's still alive.
434,00:35:01,00:35:02,That means Sara's still alive.
435,00:35:02,00:35:04,Generic stretch of desert.
436,00:35:04,00:35:07,She could be anywhere in a four-state radius.
437,00:35:07,00:35:08,Let's just focus on the details.
438,00:35:08,00:35:10,There's always something to go on.
439,00:35:10,00:35:12,"She has to make these in advance, right?"
440,00:35:13,00:35:15,But how do you plan a car wreck?
441,00:35:15,00:35:18,There's no way to know how the car's going to land.
442,00:35:18,00:35:21,"Unless you wreck the car first, and then put her under it."
443,00:35:21,00:35:25,STOKES: I think I got a VIN number. SANDERS: Give me the first six.
444,00:35:25,00:35:27,STOKES: King-Sam-Victor-four-five-three.
445,00:35:29,00:35:34,"GRISSOM: Her name is Natalie Davis, and she works for our janitorial service."
446,00:35:34,00:35:35,What?
447,00:35:35,00:35:37,Here in the lab?
448,00:35:37,00:35:38,For over a month.
449,00:35:38,00:35:42,"She's never been arrested, so there's nothing to flag on a security check."
450,00:35:42,00:35:44,She used Ernie Dell's address on her work form.
451,00:35:44,00:35:47,She has no home phone and no driver's license.
452,00:35:47,00:35:48,"(beep) Okay, I got it."
453,00:35:48,00:35:54,A 2007 red Mustang totaled outside The Trip Wire Bar six weeks ago.
454,00:35:54,00:35:56,Driver fatality. DWI.
455,00:35:56,00:35:57,Car went to scrap.

460,00:36:15,00:36:17,"Oh, my God."
461,00:36:17,00:36:19,She was at the crime scene.
462,00:36:19,00:36:25,"So, she salvages the car, and somehow gets it out to the desert, and then grabs Sara, and puts her under it?"
463,00:36:25,00:36:28,BROWN: I don't get it. What does Sara have to do with bleach? WILLOWS: I don't know.
464,00:36:29,00:36:30,This just feels different.
465,00:36:30,00:36:32,It is different.
466,00:36:43,00:36:48,This girl holds me responsible for the death of Ernie Dell.
467,00:36:48,00:36:54,"I took away the only person she ever loved, so she's going to do the same thing to me."
468,00:36:57,00:37:04,"GRISSOM: It's not about a psychotic reaction to bleach, or some dead sister or the doll."

474,00:37:42,00:37:44,"MAN: Go, go, go!"
475,00:37:44,00:37:46,"Move, move!"
476,00:37:48,00:37:51,She went out the window!
477,00:37:51,00:37:53,She's headed for the alley.
478,00:39:09,00:39:13,BRASS: I don't want to waste time screwing around with this nutcase.
479,00:39:13,00:39:18,I'm going to get some bleach and drip it on her until she gives up the location.
480,00:39:18,00:39:21,And they can't accuse us of police brutality for that.
481,00:39:21,00:39:23,"I want to talk to her, Jim."
482,00:39:24,00:39:25,Alone.
483,00:39:26,00:39:29,"Hi, Natalie."
484,00:39:30,00:39:32,My name's Gil.
485,00:39:32,00:39:35,It's so nice to finally meet you.
486,00:39:37,00:39:39,"I, uh..."
487,00:39:39,00:39:44,"probably shouldn't say this, but... I'm a huge fan."
488,00:39:46,00:39:49,I've been a crime scene investigator for 22 years.
489,00:39:49,00:39:54,"I've worked over 2,000 homicides, and you are by far..."
490,00:39:54,00:39:58,the best I've ever seen.
491,00:39:58,00:40:00,I mean...
492,00:40:03,00:40:05,...you're such a great artist.
493,00:40:07,00:40:10,And to be so young and so talented and...
494,00:40:10,00:40:12,so pretty.
495,00:40:12,00:40:15,I've thought about you every night for the last nine months.
496,00:40:15,00:40:17,I even tried to do what you do.
497,00:40:17,00:40:22,I built my own miniature.
498,00:40:22,00:40:23,You saw it?
499,00:40:23,00:40:26,How'd I do?
500,00:40:28,00:40:30,Do you play chess?
501,00:40:30,00:40:34,I play as a hobby.
502,00:40:34,00:40:36,"It quiets my mind, you know?"
503,00:40:36,00:40:37,Soothes me.
504,00:40:37,00:40:46,"At one point, I became so consumed by it that whenever I closed my eyes, I could see the chess pieces moving all around the board."
505,00:40:46,00:40:50,I was obsessed with correcting all my bad moves.
506,00:40:50,00:40:56,I wondered if a game could ever be played without a mistake.
507,00:40:56,00:40:59,I'd love to play you sometime.
508,00:40:59,00:41:03,I'm so impressed by the way you embrace your passion.
509,00:41:03,00:41:06,You'd make a great CSI.
510,00:41:06,00:41:09,This last one was brilliant.
511,00:41:09,00:41:12,You studied our crime scene so well.
512,00:41:12,00:41:17,Tracking the car to the junkyard and then towing it all the way out to the desert where you knew we wouldn't find it.
513,00:41:19,00:41:21,And then...
514,00:41:21,00:41:23,the way you killed Sara.
515,00:41:23,00:41:25,(quiet gasp)
516,00:41:26,00:41:29,I didn't kill her.
517,00:41:30,00:41:32,You didn't?
518,00:41:41,00:41:44,This is about her.
519,00:41:45,00:41:48,"Her, her, her!"
520,00:41:48,00:41:50,It's always about her.
521,00:41:50,00:41:51,"No, it isn't, Natalie."
522,00:41:51,00:41:53,It's about you. It's always about her.
523,00:41:53,00:41:54,(Natalie panting)
524,00:41:54,00:41:56,(both grunt)
525,00:41:59,00:42:01,(gasping)
526,00:42:03,00:42:18,"""Oh, sad ""was the day for the little bisque doll, ""for they cut all her stitches away, ""and found the seat of the terrible ache; T'was a delicate task..."" Natalie, listen to me-- tell me where she is."
527,00:42:18,00:42:24,"""For none of the doctors had ever before Natalie... ...performed on a dolly's inside."" Please tell me where Sara is."
528,00:42:24,00:42:32,"""They tried to restuff her ""but didn't know how, and this was her wail as she died..."" Stop it! Just stop this!"
529,00:42:32,00:42:34,Tell me where Sara is!
530,00:42:34,00:42:38,"""I've got a pain in my sawdust."
531,00:42:38,00:42:41,"""That's what's the matter with me."
532,00:42:41,00:42:43,"""Something is wrong with my little inside."
533,00:42:43,00:42:48,"""I'm just as sick as can be."
534,00:42:48,00:42:50,"""Don't let me faint."
535,00:42:50,00:42:53,"""Someone get me a fan."
536,00:42:53,00:42:55,"""Someone please run for the medicine man."
537,00:42:55,00:43:08,"""Everyone hurry ""as fast as you can, 'cause I've got a pain in my sawdust."
