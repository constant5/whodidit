1	00:00:12	00:00:18	Make sure your seat belts are securely fastened, and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins.
2	00:00:22	00:00:23	You have a good flight?
3	00:00:23	00:00:25	You have any idea how gorgeous you are?
4	00:00:25	00:00:27	Not interested, but thanks.
5	00:00:27	00:00:28	You smell good, too.
6	00:00:28	00:00:30	You know, I dreamt about you the whole flight.
7	00:00:30	00:00:32	X-rated. Is that your best line?
8	00:00:32	00:00:35	I thought chicks flying to Vegas were ready to party.
9	00:00:35	00:00:37	Sir, I'm gonna need you to take your seat.
10	00:00:37	00:00:40	Yeah, I'm gonna need another one of those free drinks, though.
11	00:00:40	00:00:42	Sorry, sweetie. Bar's closed.
12	00:00:42	00:00:44	Oh, wow, it's really not my night.
13	00:00:45	00:00:47	Psst!
14	00:00:47	00:00:49	Maybe you're not coming on strong enough.
15	00:00:51	00:00:53	This is your captain speaking.
16	00:00:53	00:00:58	We've just been cleared to land in Las Vegas, 42 and the temperature is a pleasant 84 degrees.
17	00:00:58	00:01:01	Cabin crew, please take your seats for landing.
18	00:01:05	00:01:12	On behalf of Pan Transit and the entire flight crew, I'd like to thank you for joining us and we look forward to seeing you again in the future.
19	00:01:12	00:01:13	Have a great night. A little help?
20	00:01:13	00:01:14	And good luck! Which bag is yours?
21	00:01:14	00:01:18	The yellow one. Thank you.
22	00:01:19	00:01:22	Hey, look, I-I didn't mean to come off like a creep before.
23	00:01:22	00:01:23	I was just trying to have a good time.
24	00:01:23	00:01:24	Buy you a drink to apologize?
25	00:01:24	00:01:27	I don't think so. Bottle of champagne?
26	00:01:27	00:01:29	Cut me some slack, baby! Damn!
27	00:01:30	00:01:32	Hey, what the hell?
28	00:01:33	00:01:35	Hey, my watch-- where the hell's my watch?
29	00:01:35	00:01:36	It was in my bag.
30	00:01:36	00:01:38	Hey, hey! Hold on! Hold on, all right?
31	00:01:38	00:01:39	Ain't nobody leaving this plane.
32	00:01:39	00:01:41	I've been robbed. Stewardess!
33	00:01:41	00:01:42	Don't let anybody off this plane!
34	00:01:42	00:01:44	Hey, wait, hold on a second.
35	00:01:44	00:01:46	You-you probably left it in the bar at the, uh, airport...
36	00:01:46	00:01:48	Ain't nobody got no time for your jokes, man, okay?
37	00:01:48	00:01:49	I'm gonna need some help finding my watch.
38	00:01:49	00:01:51	Hey, hey, hey!
39	00:01:51	00:01:52	What? My wallet's gone, okay?
40	00:01:52	00:01:53	Somebody stole my wallet.
41	00:01:55	00:01:59	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Somebody definitely went through my bag! Who went through my bag?
42	00:01:59	00:02:00	They stealing on this plane! Hey!
43	00:02:00	00:02:02	Come on! (passengers clamoring)
44	00:02:02	00:02:03	I got to get off!
45	00:02:03	00:02:05	Come on, damn it! Hey, hey! Get back, man!
46	00:02:05	00:02:06	What the hell's wrong with you, man?
47	00:02:13	00:02:15	You know...
48	00:02:15	00:02:19	there's something about being at the airport, that makes me just want to jump on the next plane out of here.
49	00:02:19	00:02:20	Doesn't matter where.
50	00:02:20	00:02:22	Excitement of the unknown.
51	00:02:22	00:02:23	No, Sara, I got big plans.
52	00:02:23	00:02:26	Really? Yeah, Morocco.
53	00:02:26	00:02:28	You gonna open a bar in Casablanca, Nick?
54	00:02:28	00:02:30	Call me Rick. (laughs)
55	00:02:30	00:02:32	I think that was his name, wasn't it?
56	00:02:40	00:02:42	Caucasian female, early 30s.
57	00:02:46	00:02:48	Blunt force trauma to the head.
58	00:02:53	00:02:55	Well, looks like she started out on the road.
59	00:02:55	00:02:56	Skidded through the dirt and...
60	00:02:56	00:02:59	she came to rest right here.
61	00:02:59	00:03:00	Long way to roll.
62	00:03:00	00:03:02	She hit the road with significant velocity.
63	00:03:02	00:03:04	It would explain the road rash...
64	00:03:08	00:03:10	...and the broken neck.
65	00:03:14	00:03:15	She's dressed for a good time.
66	00:03:15	00:03:16	I don't think she found it.
67	00:03:18	00:03:20	Sara?
68	00:03:23	00:03:25	Janet Riggins, Pan Transit flight 111.
69	00:03:25	00:03:27	Originated in Newark.
70	00:03:27	00:03:28	Layover in Atlanta.
71	00:03:28	00:03:30	45 tonight.
72	00:03:30	00:03:33	Well, that's got to be some kind of record.
73	00:03:33	00:03:35	Dead in under an hour.
74	00:03:36	00:03:38	Welcome to Las Vegas.
75	00:04:16	00:04:18	Everyone, please, everyone, listen up.
76	00:04:18	00:04:19	Please, everyone.
77	00:04:19	00:04:21	Excuse me.
78	00:04:21	00:04:22	Look, my credit cards are in my wallet.
79	00:04:22	00:04:24	My driver's license.
80	00:04:24	00:04:26	How am I supposed to check into my hotel, huh?
81	00:04:26	00:04:28	That pendant was irreplaceable.
82	00:04:28	00:04:29	Irreplaceable!
83	00:04:29	00:04:31	My mother gave it to me.
84	00:04:31	00:04:32	My dead mother.
85	00:04:32	00:04:33	Now, we want to help you.
86	00:04:33	00:04:35	But we need your cooperation.
87	00:04:35	00:04:38	Okay? Police officers are gonna be taking your statements.
88	00:04:38	00:04:40	And after that, you're free to go.
89	00:04:40	00:04:42	It's a family heirloom. Do you understand that?
90	00:04:42	00:04:44	Where am I supposed to sleep tonight, huh? Yeah!
91	00:04:44	00:04:48	All right, look, the airlines, the airlines are gonna help those of you who have to make connections.
92	00:04:48	00:04:51	And when they can't, they're gonna offer you hotel vouchers.
93	00:04:51	00:04:53	At the cheapest hotel you can find.
94	00:04:53	00:04:58	But first, CSI Finlay and I need your help to do our job.
95	00:04:58	00:05:03	Do you remember a woman who was seated in row three, seat D.
96	00:05:03	00:05:07	3D. Ooh, let me conjure up the seating plan in my head, and do your job for you.
97	00:05:07	00:05:13	Anybody here sit in row two, three or four?
98	00:05:13	00:05:15	Okay, some of you men might've remembered her.
99	00:05:15	00:05:19	She had long blonde hair, a white dress, heels.
100	00:05:19	00:05:21	Yeah, yeah, the blonde with the ass in the tight, white dress.
101	00:05:21	00:05:23	Why? Did she steal my wallet, huh?
102	00:05:23	00:05:25	I was sitting right behind her.
103	00:05:25	00:05:27	She was acting very suspicious.
104	00:05:29	00:05:33	The woman that we are talking about was just found dead.
105	00:05:35	00:05:39	So that makes this a homicide investigation.
106	00:05:39	00:05:40	And you...
107	00:05:40	00:05:43	are the last people to see her alive.
108	00:05:43	00:05:44	Him!
109	00:05:44	00:05:45	He was harassing her.
110	00:05:45	00:05:46	She wanted nothing to do with him.
111	00:05:46	00:05:47	I was just talking to the lady.
112	00:05:47	00:05:49	Hater.
113	00:05:49	00:05:50	Excuse me, sir?
114	00:05:50	00:05:52	Could you tell me how you got the black eye?
115	00:05:52	00:05:53	Yeah, yeah.
116	00:05:53	00:05:55	He-he didn't have that on the plane, man.
117	00:05:55	00:05:57	Hey, you need to mind your damn business. Yeah, right.
118	00:05:57	00:06:00	My watch was in my carry-on in the overhead bin.
119	00:06:00	00:06:01	When I realized it had been stolen...
120	00:06:01	00:06:04	No one is leaving this plane! I want to get by here...
121	00:06:04	00:06:06	Relax, okay? Somebody stole my watch!
122	00:06:06	00:06:08	Let me get by!
123	00:06:08	00:06:10	I hit my head when I fell. Old guy, he fights dirty.
124	00:06:10	00:06:13	When I looked up, I saw the blonde pushing her way out.
125	00:06:13	00:06:16	And that was the last time I saw her.
126	00:06:16	00:06:18	Can anyone else confirm that story?
127	00:06:18	00:06:19	Yeah, the old guy had some fight left in him.
128	00:06:19	00:06:23	I don't know about all that, all I know is the blonde wanted off the plane.
129	00:06:23	00:06:24	Am I right? Right?
130	00:06:24	00:06:26	We all saw that.
131	00:06:31	00:06:35	The airline confirms Janet Riggins' flight landed on time.
132	00:06:35	00:06:36	Gate F24.
133	00:06:36	00:06:42	F Gate means she had to take the tram to baggage claim, pick up her checked bags.
134	00:06:42	00:06:43	Well, she ended up here.
135	00:06:43	00:06:45	She had to have left the airport.
136	00:06:45	00:06:46	Road leads directly there.
137	00:06:46	00:06:48	Yeah, but there's a big convention in town.
138	00:06:48	00:06:51	Long lines for taxis, rental cars, shuttle buses.
139	00:06:51	00:06:52	She'd still be waiting in line.
140	00:06:52	00:06:53	She could've walked.
141	00:06:53	00:06:55	Right, maybe in your shoes.
142	00:06:55	00:06:56	But not in those heels.
143	00:06:58	00:07:02	So... somebody picked her up and gave her one hell of a ride.
144	00:07:10	00:07:13	I think she left the vehicle at this swerve mark.
145	00:07:13	00:07:14	Right here.
146	00:07:14	00:07:19	Distance from there to where she came to rest is 75 feet, so...
147	00:07:19	00:07:25	30 is the constant, multiplied by 75 feet, times the coefficient of friction for sliding...
148	00:07:25	00:07:27	On this terrain, I'd give it a...
149	00:07:27	00:07:28	a one.
150	00:07:28	00:07:29	One? Lucky guess.
151	00:07:29	00:07:31	2,250 feet.
152	00:07:31	00:07:35	Square root of that.
153	00:07:35	00:07:38	Vehicle was traveling about 45 miles an hour.
154	00:07:38	00:07:39	You physics majors, you're...
155	00:07:39	00:07:41	you're show-offs.
156	00:07:43	00:07:45	So the driver never hit the brakes.
157	00:07:45	00:07:47	This was no accident.
158	00:07:47	00:07:49	And either she jumped out or was thrown out.
159	00:07:49	00:07:51	Her luggage could still be in the car.
160	00:07:51	00:07:54	If we're lucky, maybe the driver threw it out with her.
161	00:07:55	00:07:56	Nick, down!
162	00:07:57	00:08:00	Laser... pointed right at your chest.
163	00:08:00	00:08:02	You see anything?
164	00:08:05	00:08:06	There. Right there.
165	00:08:10	00:08:12	Hey! Las Vegas Police.
166	00:08:14	00:08:16	No, no, no!
167	00:08:16	00:08:19	No, no, no, no, no, no. I got him, I got him, get this other guy!
168	00:08:19	00:08:21	Stay down! Keep your hands where I can see them! Don't move!
169	00:08:23	00:08:25	What are you doing?
170	00:08:33	00:08:34	What the hell are you doing?!
171	00:08:34	00:08:36	Watching some planes, man.
172	00:08:36	00:08:37	Huh?
173	00:08:37	00:08:39	Don't point that thing at me!
174	00:08:39	00:08:41	Chill! All right?
175	00:08:41	00:08:42	We're just having a little fun.
176	00:08:42	00:08:44	Hey, I got the other one!
177	00:08:44	00:08:47	You know that flashing pilots with your little laser's a felony?
178	00:08:47	00:08:49	You're interfering with federal air operations.
179	00:08:52	00:08:54	There was a murder out here tonight.
180	00:08:56	00:08:57	Did you and your buddy see anything?
181	00:09:00	00:09:01	We'll find out.
182	00:09:30	00:09:34	I hear you and Nick collared a couple of would-be terrorists tonight. Yeah.
183	00:09:34	00:09:38	Yeah, Nick threatened to bring the FBI down on them unless they turn over their laser pointers.
184	00:09:38	00:09:39	And then he called their parents.
185	00:09:39	00:09:42	Who, I'm sure, were very proud.
186	00:09:42	00:09:44	So, where are we with our victim?
187	00:09:44	00:09:49	Well, Mr. Scare 'Em Straight and I found the victim's carry-on bag down the road from the crime scene.
188	00:09:49	00:09:52	There's not much to go on, but she is a local.
189	00:09:52	00:09:54	Found a Nevada license.
190	00:09:56	00:09:59	Janet Riggins.
191	00:09:59	00:10:01	1432 Desert Vista.
192	00:10:01	00:10:02	I'll have Brass look at this.
193	00:10:09	00:10:11	Can I see your license for a second?
194	00:10:13	00:10:15	Sure.
195	00:10:20	00:10:21	Look at your photo.
196	00:10:21	00:10:25	Uh-huh, when it's backlit, you can see the perforated outline of Nevada.
197	00:10:25	00:10:27	Right.
198	00:10:27	00:10:29	Janet's...
199	00:10:31	00:10:32	...not so much.
200	00:10:32	00:10:33	So...
201	00:10:33	00:10:36	why does Ms. Riggins need a fake I.D.?
202	00:10:38	00:10:41	Here's some video surveillance from outside the baggage claim.
203	00:10:41	00:10:43	That's the victim, right? Janet Riggins?
204	00:10:43	00:10:45	If that's even her real name, yeah.
205	00:10:45	00:10:47	Sure is looking over her shoulder a lot.
206	00:10:47	00:10:51	And what's she doing leaving baggage claim with no checked bags?
207	00:10:51	00:10:52	She didn't stick around to claim 'em.
208	00:10:52	00:10:55	And the reason she didn't stick around is...
209	00:10:57	00:10:58	...Kenny Greene.
210	00:10:58	00:10:59	He was a passenger on her flight.
211	00:10:59	00:11:00	He had his watch stolen.
212	00:11:00	00:11:03	He told me the last time he saw our victim was on the plane.
213	00:11:03	00:11:04	That's a lie.
214	00:11:04	00:11:08	Yeah, and not only that, when I met him, he had a fresh black eye.
215	00:11:08	00:11:13	He told me that he got it when a fellow passenger banged his head on an armrest.
216	00:11:13	00:11:15	Well, if he got it on the plane, then we should see it right here.
217	00:11:15	00:11:17	You think she gave it to him?
218	00:11:17	00:11:19	I like to keep things simple in the beginning.
219	00:11:19	00:11:22	He ended up with a shiner; she ended up dead.
220	00:11:29	00:11:30	My man!
221	00:11:30	00:11:32	Any luck with that watch?
222	00:11:32	00:11:34	Wow, the party never stops for you, does it?
223	00:11:36	00:11:38	Have you slept since the last time I talked to you?
224	00:11:38	00:11:39	You ever been to Combustion Junction?
225	00:11:39	00:11:41	(chuckles) My lap is still achin'.
226	00:11:41	00:11:42	It's open 24/7.
227	00:11:45	00:11:47	You want to tell me again about that black eye?
228	00:11:49	00:11:50	Okay. Busted.
229	00:11:50	00:11:52	I didn't get it on the plane.
230	00:11:52	00:11:53	No, you got it when you beat up Janet Riggins.
231	00:11:53	00:11:55	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
232	00:11:55	00:11:57	Then how'd she end up dead?
233	00:11:57	00:11:58	I ran into the blonde at baggage claim.
234	00:11:58	00:12:02	Look, I just figured it was the Vegas gods giving me another crack at it. I bet you're really tight with all the Vegas deities.
235	00:12:02	00:12:04	You know, me? I'm tight with Father Time.
236	00:12:04	00:12:06	You know, like time code.
237	00:12:06	00:12:10	See, the time this picture was taken and the time you showed up at the gate...
238	00:12:10	00:12:12	that was two hours of free time. She was hot, man!
239	00:12:12	00:12:13	I was looking to score.
240	00:12:13	00:12:15	You can't arrest a guy for trying.
241	00:12:15	00:12:17	But when she saw me, she ran.
242	00:12:17	00:12:19	And that's when I knew she stole my watch.
243	00:12:19	00:12:20	Only the guilty run.
244	00:12:22	00:12:24	Hey, babe? Yeah.
245	00:12:24	00:12:26	You got something that belongs to me.
246	00:12:26	00:12:28	You want your phone, give me back my watch.
247	00:12:29	00:12:31	Hey, that's assault!
248	00:12:31	00:12:33	Look, I didn't see that coming.
249	00:12:33	00:12:34	All right?
250	00:12:34	00:12:36	But that was the last time I saw her.
251	00:12:36	00:12:40	I spent the rest of my free time at the airport bar, waiting on you guys to show up.
252	00:12:40	00:12:42	Hey, if you don't believe me, just ask the bartender.
253	00:12:42	00:12:44	She gave me her number.
254	00:12:44	00:12:45	Let's say I believe you, okay?
255	00:12:45	00:12:47	Do you still have Janet Riggins' cell phone?
256	00:12:50	00:12:51	Oh...
257	00:12:51	00:12:53	You stole her phone?
258	00:12:53	00:12:54	Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
259	00:12:54	00:12:55	I was bargaining.
260	00:12:55	00:12:56	I'm bargaining, too.
261	00:12:56	00:13:00	So what do I get if I charge you with robbery and strong-arm assault?
262	00:13:02	00:13:04	I can't catch a break.
263	00:13:13	00:13:14	Hey.
264	00:13:14	00:13:17	Any luck I.D.'ing my victim?
265	00:13:17	00:13:18	Well, she's got a burner phone.
266	00:13:18	00:13:21	You can get one of those at any corner store or gas station. Yeah.
267	00:13:21	00:13:23	Burner phone, fake I.D....
268	00:13:23	00:13:25	She sure is going to a lot of trouble to stay anonymous.
269	00:13:25	00:13:29	Well, if I were to pull a mid-air caper, I'd fly under an alias, too.
270	00:13:29	00:13:32	She's got a Vegas number.
271	00:13:32	00:13:33	Chances are she bought it local.
272	00:13:36	00:13:42	Disregarding all the calls her drunken assailant made to various call girls and phone sex operators last night...
273	00:13:42	00:13:42	Nice.
274	00:13:44	00:13:47	...got one text, 48 p.m.
275	00:13:47	00:13:49	to a local number.
276	00:13:49	00:13:51	Landed.
277	00:13:55	00:13:56	No registered owner.
278	00:13:56	00:13:57	Another burner.
279	00:13:57	00:13:59	I'll get an AG Waiver for the detail records.
280	00:13:59	00:14:01	Maybe she texted her ride.
281	00:14:01	00:14:03	Or getaway driver. Mmm.
282	00:14:04	00:14:09	Also, she made one phone call, 01, to a different local number.
283	00:14:14	00:14:16	Nalley Janitorial Services.
284	00:14:16	00:14:18	North Las Vegas.
285	00:14:19	00:14:22	Maybe she needed someone to clean up her mess.
286	00:14:30	00:14:32	Jefferson Nalley?
287	00:14:32	00:14:34	Yeah, uh... you must be the guys that called.
288	00:14:35	00:14:36	Yeah, I'm Nick Stokes.
289	00:14:36	00:14:38	This is Sara Sidle.
290	00:14:38	00:14:39	We're with the crime scene unit.
291	00:14:39	00:14:41	Need you to take a look at a photo, if you don't mind.
292	00:14:41	00:14:42	That's all?
293	00:14:42	00:14:43	Yeah. Sure.
294	00:14:43	00:14:45	Know this woman?
295	00:14:45	00:14:50	No, no, never seen Then why'd she call you last night, right before she was murdered?
296	00:14:52	00:14:53	Want to take another look?
297	00:14:59	00:15:01	It kind of looks like Helen Morrison.
298	00:15:01	00:15:03	Helen Morrison? Yeah.
299	00:15:03	00:15:05	God, I haven't seen her since high school.
300	00:15:05	00:15:06	She went blonde.
301	00:15:06	00:15:07	What high school?
302	00:15:07	00:15:08	Uh, Hardison High.
303	00:15:08	00:15:09	Back in Hoboken.
304	00:15:09	00:15:12	Yeah, Helen and I grew up together.
305	00:15:12	00:15:15	Wait, did you just say that she was murdered?
306	00:15:15	00:15:16	You moved out here together?
307	00:15:16	00:15:18	No, no, I...
308	00:15:18	00:15:20	I-I came out here for college.
309	00:15:20	00:15:22	The last I heard from Helen, she was living in...
310	00:15:22	00:15:23	Saddle River.
311	00:15:23	00:15:25	So you have kept in touch?
312	00:15:25	00:15:26	Well, no.
313	00:15:26	00:15:27	I mean, not really.
314	00:15:27	00:15:31	We-we reconnected online about six months ago.
315	00:15:31	00:15:32	Did you know she was in Vegas?
316	00:15:32	00:15:36	I knew that she was planning a trip out west, and maybe swinging through Vegas...
317	00:15:36	00:15:38	And you two were gonna hook up, is that the deal?
318	00:15:41	00:15:43	Look, I can button up that van, tow it downtown, and we can talk down there.
319	00:15:43	00:15:45	I don't care.
320	00:15:45	00:15:51	After Helen found me online, okay, she-she never mentioned that she was married.
321	00:15:51	00:15:53	And then a couple months later, she let it slip.
322	00:15:53	00:15:55	Look, I don't mess around with married chicks anymore.
323	00:15:55	00:15:56	There's too many complications.
324	00:15:56	00:15:58	You know what I mean.
325	00:15:59	00:16:00	I cut it off.
326	00:16:00	00:16:02	Then why was she calling you?
327	00:16:02	00:16:04	I don't know.
328	00:16:04	00:16:08	Look, I-I'd love to help you guys out, but I've got my hands full right now.
329	00:16:08	00:16:10	Half my crew just quit on me, so...
330	00:16:12	00:16:14	You know what?
331	00:16:14	00:16:17	Las night, I sent her call through to voicemail.
332	00:16:17	00:16:18	So... I mean, knock yourself out.
333	00:16:18	00:16:22	Jeff, I know I'm not supposed to contact you, but I need help.
334	00:16:22	00:16:23	I don't know who else to ask.
335	00:16:23	00:16:25	Just call me back.
336	00:16:26	00:16:27	Some friend.
337	00:16:27	00:16:30	Like I said, I cut it off.
338	00:16:30	00:16:32	Well, it's not my problem.
339	00:16:34	00:16:36	You know what?
340	00:16:36	00:16:39	I bet you guys need some cleanup every once in a while.
341	00:16:39	00:16:40	I sure would love the opportunity.
342	00:16:43	00:16:45	Yeah, I'd love to help, but my hands are full.
343	00:18:23	00:18:28	According to the flight manifest, Helen Morrison was the last passenger to board Flight 111.
344	00:18:28	00:18:30	She sat here, in 3-D.
345	00:18:30	00:18:36	Flight attendant said that her carry-on did not fit underneath the seat in front of her, the overhead bin was full...
346	00:18:36	00:18:39	I'm going to have to take your bag, sweetie.
347	00:18:39	00:18:41	I'd really prefer to keep it down here. I got it, I got it.
348	00:18:41	00:18:43	I prefer to have it here. Thanks. I'll put it here.
349	00:18:43	00:18:46	She stowed it here, two rows back.
350	00:18:46	00:18:47	The open bins are the ones that were robbed?
351	00:18:47	00:18:51	Yes, there were 12 passengers who filed police reports.
352	00:18:51	00:18:54	These are the four targeted bins.
353	00:18:54	00:19:00	And in each one of these bins there was at least one bag that was at some distance from its owner.
354	00:19:00	00:19:07	Well, that makes sense, because it's pretty risky to be rifling through someone's bag when the owner is sitting right beneath it.
355	00:19:10	00:19:13	board the plane early.
356	00:19:13	00:19:15	Find a seat with a view.
357	00:19:15	00:19:16	And I don't mean a view outside.
358	00:19:16	00:19:24	Our crook, in order to get a view of the targeted bins, had to have sat aft of row eight.
359	00:19:24	00:19:27	And he didn't want to sit so far back in the plane that he was on the flight attendant's lap.
360	00:19:27	00:19:30	And we have to presume that our suspect boarded in the first wave.
361	00:19:30	00:19:34	So that definitely rules out Helen Morrison as our thief.
362	00:19:34	00:19:40	She boarded last, sat forward of the targeted bins, so she wouldn't have been able to have eyes on.
363	00:19:40	00:19:43	To get eyes on and good visibility, an aisle seat is the best seat.
364	00:19:43	00:19:45	So that leaves us with...
365	00:19:46	00:19:48	...eight suspects.
366	00:19:48	00:19:49	Who boarded early?
367	00:19:51	00:19:53	9-C.
368	00:19:53	00:19:55	Hank Kasserman boarded with the first group.
369	00:19:55	00:19:58	Families with children and those needing assistance.
370	00:19:58	00:20:01	You think a senior citizen would qualify for that?
371	00:20:01	00:20:03	Because I spoke with another passenger...
372	00:20:03	00:20:05	his name is Kenny Greene.
373	00:20:05	00:20:07	He had his watch stolen.
374	00:20:07	00:20:13	Now, he told me he had an altercation with, quote, an elderly gentleman who was in a real hurry to get off the plane.
375	00:20:15	00:20:20	Hank Kasserman, you've been upgraded to our number one suspect.
376	00:20:25	00:20:27	Hey, Hank, sit down, please.
377	00:20:32	00:20:39	Wow, you know, Hank, you know, you got almost enough frequent flyer miles for a free room at the Grey Bar Motel.
378	00:20:39	00:20:41	That's the minimum security prison in Indian Springs.
379	00:20:41	00:20:46	I was thinking of, um, saving my miles for a trip to Algeria.
380	00:20:46	00:20:48	That's good. There's no extradition.
381	00:20:48	00:20:52	You know, more than a few of your recent trips have coincided with in-flight thefts.
382	00:20:52	00:20:55	That's why I got a brand-new bag.
383	00:20:55	00:21:00	Tamper-proof zipper and an extra lock. You know, these days you can't trust anyone, right?
384	00:21:00	00:21:02	They're awful.
385	00:21:02	00:21:03	And, by the way, I like watches.
386	00:21:03	00:21:04	That's a nice watch you're wearing.
387	00:21:04	00:21:06	Oh. Well, you see, it's new.
388	00:21:06	00:21:11	Now, if I flipped it over, I wouldn't see an engraving, Cristal Kenny on the back, would I?
389	00:21:11	00:21:13	Oh, yeah. Kenny is my father.
390	00:21:14	00:21:16	Big drinker.
391	00:21:16	00:21:18	Yeah, you're very quick for an old guy, I gotta tell ya.
392	00:21:18	00:21:21	You're pretty slow for a young guy.
393	00:21:21	00:21:22	All right, let me show you something.
394	00:21:22	00:21:25	Here's a list of the things that were stolen from Flight 111.
395	00:21:25	00:21:30	And this is a list of the items that were recovered from your hotel suite.
396	00:21:30	00:21:31	Mm-hmm.
397	00:21:31	00:21:32	It's an exact match.
398	00:21:32	00:21:34	No!
399	00:21:34	00:21:36	I hear you had a big night at the casino last night.
400	00:21:36	00:21:40	I was up, then I was down, and I was up.
401	00:21:40	00:21:44	Yeah, well, now you're down again, Hank, 'cause you're with me; you're in the police station.
402	00:21:44	00:21:48	I've got you on 12 counts of grand larceny.
403	00:21:48	00:21:51	So how far are you gonna fall?
404	00:21:54	00:21:56	What do you want to know?
405	00:21:56	00:22:01	You walked in the Mediterranean casino last night with a very big wedge of cash-- tell me about it.
406	00:22:01	00:22:04	It's a score of a lifetime.
407	00:22:04	00:22:06	There was a woman on the plane.
408	00:22:06	00:22:08	Blonde and in 3-D.
409	00:22:10	00:22:12	Clocked her the moment she walked on the plane.
410	00:22:12	00:22:14	Very well-dressed.
411	00:22:14	00:22:18	And she was wearing expensive shoes, expensive clothes.
412	00:22:18	00:22:20	She had a designer carry-on.
413	00:22:20	00:22:24	She was very reluctant to let the flight attendant put it in the bin a few rows back.
414	00:22:24	00:22:25	Please... please, just this once, please...
415	00:22:25	00:22:27	Can you just...? Okay. Right there.
416	00:22:29	00:22:33	So she put it two rows back right over Cristal Kenny's seat.
417	00:22:33	00:22:36	He was three sheets to the wind. And I sent him the fourth.
418	00:22:36	00:22:41	I'd like to buy my friend in 5-D a drink.
419	00:22:41	00:22:42	I needed him passed out.
420	00:22:42	00:22:49	Passengers who are sleeping or, uh, reading or, uh, watching a movie, they're easy marks.
421	00:22:49	00:22:51	Oh, you're a real student of human nature, Hank.
422	00:22:51	00:22:55	When I'm working, I don't leave anything to chance.
423	00:22:55	00:22:57	When I'm playing...
424	00:22:57	00:22:58	I'm all on black.
425	00:22:58	00:23:01	What did you steal from the blonde?
426	00:23:01	00:23:06	Chick like that, I expected you know, diamonds, uh, jewelry.
427	00:23:06	00:23:09	But.. I hit the mother lode.
428	00:23:17	00:23:19	30 G's.
429	00:23:19	00:23:22	Is this the blonde?
430	00:23:23	00:23:25	Well, I had nothing to do with that.
431	00:23:25	00:23:29	Hank, it's time to go all in now.
432	00:23:29	00:23:31	All on the black.
433	00:23:33	00:23:34	Okay.
434	00:23:34	00:23:36	Let me tell you what I saw.
435	00:23:36	00:23:41	A woman of means traveling alone.
436	00:23:41	00:23:43	She knew how to handle that drunk.
437	00:23:43	00:23:47	Never closed her eyes. And kept, kept putting makeup on.
438	00:23:47	00:23:50	Especially over here.
439	00:23:50	00:23:54	She was trying to hide a, a bruise.
440	00:23:55	00:23:58	Now she's dead?
441	00:23:59	00:24:06	You should be looking for that guy that used her as a punching bag.
442	00:24:06	00:24:09	Not some senior citizen on a fixed income.
443	00:24:15	00:24:17	Hey, Doc.
444	00:24:17	00:24:19	Heard you got a C.O.D. I do.
445	00:24:20	00:24:26	Atlanto-occipital dislocation due to being thrown from a moving vehicle.
446	00:24:26	00:24:28	But that's the least troubling thing I found.
447	00:24:28	00:24:31	Ms. Morrison was married.
448	00:24:31	00:24:33	Yeah. Brass is tracking down her husband.
449	00:24:33	00:24:42	She has multiple perimortem fractures consistent with falling from a moving vehicle, but these bony calluses indicate healed fractures.
450	00:24:42	00:24:48	This ulna fracture here is typically the result of a direct blow while the arm's in self-defense.
451	00:24:48	00:24:50	No... No!
452	00:24:50	00:24:52	Ms. Morrison has also has several broken ribs.
453	00:24:52	00:24:55	Two ribs, two separate events.
454	00:24:55	00:24:59	Left number five, judging by the size of the callus, is about six months old.
455	00:24:59	00:25:04	Break to left number six, Callus is larger, but not fully formed.
456	00:25:04	00:25:06	That's a recent injury, only a few weeks.
457	00:25:06	00:25:09	It looks like he gave her a black eye, too.
458	00:25:09	00:25:11	Yeah, it was hidden under her makeup.
459	00:25:11	00:25:13	That's only a few days old.
460	00:25:13	00:25:15	Well, the old man on the plane was right.
461	00:25:15	00:25:17	She's been physically abused.
462	00:25:17	00:25:23	Yeah. Given the number of healed fractures, it's been going on for years.
463	00:25:34	00:25:38	Yeah, I heard the airline finally located Helen Morrison's checked luggage.
464	00:25:38	00:25:43	And not what you usually pack childhood photos, teddy bear...
465	00:25:45	00:25:46	her bronzed baby shoes.
466	00:25:46	00:25:49	No, that's what you pack when you're never going home again.
467	00:25:49	00:25:51	She was definitely leaving her husband.
468	00:25:51	00:25:53	New identity, new cell phone.
469	00:25:53	00:25:55	$30,000 in cash.
470	00:25:55	00:25:57	She had a plan.
471	00:25:57	00:25:58	Saddle River PD just called.
472	00:25:58	00:25:59	Helen Morrison's husband was not home.
473	00:25:59	00:26:03	Evidently, he caught a flight to Vegas.
474	00:26:03	00:26:07	So, the woman he's been using as a punching bag finally left him, and he followed her.
475	00:26:07	00:26:10	Do we know what time his flight got in?
476	00:26:10	00:26:11	Yeah. Morrison caught a nonstop.
477	00:26:11	00:26:13	Helen's flight had a layover.
478	00:26:13	00:26:15	So that put him in about 15 minutes before her.
479	00:26:15	00:26:17	Well, that give him motive and opportunity.
480	00:26:17	00:26:19	(phone ringing) Yep. Hold on a sec.
481	00:26:21	00:26:25	Doc Robbins says that out concerned husband is in Autopsy as we speak.
482	00:26:25	00:26:27	What the hell's he doing down there? No idea.
483	00:26:27	00:26:31	Look, Doctor, I know you've got your rules, but we're talking about my wife!
484	00:26:31	00:26:33	The cops just told me that she was dead.
485	00:26:33	00:26:35	I have a right to say good-bye.
486	00:26:35	00:26:37	Look, her body's already been identified.
487	00:26:37	00:26:39	There's no reason for you to be here.
488	00:26:39	00:26:42	No reason? A mortuary can provide the final viewing.
489	00:26:42	00:26:43	The final view...? Hey!
490	00:26:43	00:26:45	What are you talking about? I'm not your wife!
491	00:26:45	00:26:47	Hey, hey, hey! Mr. Morrison, what are you doing?
492	00:26:47	00:26:49	Sorry. I just got a little worked up.
493	00:26:49	00:26:51	All right, I'm Nick Stokes.
494	00:26:51	00:26:53	I'm the one handling your wife's murder, okay?
495	00:26:53	00:26:56	Did you catch the bastard who did it yet?
496	00:26:56	00:26:58	I will.
497	00:26:58	00:27:00	Well, what's that supposed to mean?
498	00:27:00	00:27:02	That the, that the husband is always the first suspect?
499	00:27:02	00:27:04	There's a good reason for that.
500	00:27:04	00:27:08	Listen, my wife and I had a very physical relationship.
501	00:27:08	00:27:09	Oh, we know. Bodies don't lie.
502	00:27:09	00:27:11	What's this say?!
503	00:27:12	00:27:14	She liked to test me.
504	00:27:14	00:27:17	She liked to make me feel jealous.
505	00:27:17	00:27:20	She would leave little bread crumbs all over the place.
506	00:27:20	00:27:26	Like a few months ago when she left her e-mail open so that I could read a little exchange between her and an old flame.
507	00:27:26	00:27:28	That's why you broke her arm.
508	00:27:28	00:27:29	Would you shut up?
509	00:27:29	00:27:32	There were pictures, explicit pictures.
510	00:27:32	00:27:35	So when I confronted her, she denied it.
511	00:27:35	00:27:37	Which is another game she likes to play.
512	00:27:37	00:27:40	But yesterday, Helen crossed the line.
513	00:27:40	00:27:47	I get a call from my bank which says that she withdrew all of our money.
514	00:27:47	00:27:49	All of my money.
515	00:27:49	00:27:52	So I go home, and she's gone.
516	00:27:52	00:27:54	And you took the next flight out.
517	00:27:54	00:27:55	So you'd be here when she landed.
518	00:27:55	00:27:57	Yes, that's right, Sherlock.
519	00:27:57	00:28:00	I figured she would run to her boyfriend.
520	00:28:00	00:28:01	But my plane was delayed.
521	00:28:01	00:28:03	A mechanical error.
522	00:28:03	00:28:06	And I didn't get in until after midnight.
523	00:28:08	00:28:10	Which is probably better.
524	00:28:10	00:28:12	Saved me a life sentence.
525	00:28:12	00:28:13	Oh, we'll check with the airlines.
526	00:28:13	00:28:16	Okay, fine, do that, Doctor! Check the airlines!
527	00:28:16	00:28:18	But I'm not leaving here until I see my wife's dead body.
528	00:28:18	00:28:20	And I want my money back.
529	00:28:20	00:28:21	Now, tell me about this boyfriend.
530	00:28:21	00:28:23	Does he have a name?
531	00:28:23	00:28:27	He has this little housecleaning business, the little schmuck.
532	00:28:27	00:28:29	His name is Jefferson.
533	00:28:33	00:28:44	When that psychotic husband of hers found out that we'd been chatting online, he put her in the hospital. If you're looking for who killed her, you should look at him.
534	00:28:44	00:28:45	That guy is dangerous.
535	00:28:45	00:28:47	He's a control freak.
536	00:28:47	00:28:51	He monitored all of her phone calls, all of her e-mails.
537	00:28:51	00:28:54	He kept track of every nickel that she spent.
538	00:28:54	00:28:57	Now, look, I-I know you think that I am a real S.O.B., but...
539	00:28:57	00:29:02	Maybe if you'd helped her, answered her call, she'd still be alive.
540	00:29:02	00:29:03	I did help her.
541	00:29:03	00:29:15	When I found out that Allen had been hitting her, how many times he put her in the hospital, I begged her to leave him.
542	00:29:15	00:29:18	I set her up with this guy.
543	00:29:18	00:29:20	I-I met him in a bar a while back.
544	00:29:20	00:29:26	And for a price, he could make anybody disappear.
545	00:29:26	00:29:27	This guy have a name?
546	00:29:27	00:29:29	He went by The Wolf.
547	00:29:29	00:29:30	The Wolf?
548	00:29:30	00:29:34	He was like a private witness relocation program.
549	00:29:34	00:29:37	And I, I arranged the-the introduction.
550	00:29:37	00:29:39	Did he pick her up at the airport?
551	00:29:39	00:29:41	See, that's just the thing. I don't know. I-I'm not sure.
552	00:29:41	00:29:45	See, he had these rules, nonnegotiable rules.
553	00:29:45	00:29:51	And Helen and I, we were to cut off all communication with each other for at least six months, maybe more.
554	00:29:51	00:29:57	And we weren't supposed to trust calls or e-mails from each other because they could've been a trap.
555	00:29:57	00:30:00	And we could have ended up hurt or... or dead.
556	00:30:00	00:30:05	Helen was beaten last night, and then she was pushed from a moving vehicle.
557	00:30:07	00:30:09	Do you think that The Wolf killed her?
558	00:30:09	00:30:10	How do I get a hold of him?
559	00:30:10	00:30:15	Well, I, uh... I have a cell phone number for him.
560	00:30:15	00:30:16	I-I don't know if it's still good.
561	00:30:20	00:30:23	It's the phone number that Helen texted when she landed.
562	00:30:23	00:30:26	According to the boyfriend, it was payment on arrival.
563	00:30:26	00:30:31	The Wolf had paid for her plane ticket, her fake I.D., her cell phone, and any other arrangements that he'd made for her future.
564	00:30:31	00:30:34	But after she was robbed, she had no money to pay him.
565	00:30:34	00:30:37	Probably why she ignored The Wolf's instructions and called the boyfriend.
566	00:30:37	00:30:38	But he didn't answer.
567	00:30:38	00:30:39	She really had no choice.
568	00:30:39	00:30:40	She had to stick to the plan.
569	00:30:40	00:30:43	Well, he left a trail, so...
570	00:30:43	00:30:45	let's track down this wolf.
571	00:31:27	00:31:33	Brass and I checked out the bar where the vic's boyfriend says he met The Wolf.
572	00:31:33	00:31:35	No one there knew him. Although the sun was still up.
573	00:31:35	00:31:38	So we'll go back later and talk to the night crowd.
574	00:31:38	00:31:41	But I did meet a guy named The Goat, who says he'll eat anything for a dollar.
575	00:31:41	00:31:43	Beard, pierced ear? Yeah.
576	00:31:43	00:31:45	I had to get evidence out of him once.
577	00:31:45	00:31:46	Gross.
578	00:31:46	00:31:49	Helen's cell was purchased at the Silver Wagon Convenience Store on Flamingo.
579	00:31:49	00:31:51	No functioning cameras.
580	00:31:51	00:31:53	Buyer paid all cash.
581	00:31:53	00:31:56	Her plane ticket was bought on Boulder Highway at Truxton Travel.
582	00:31:56	00:31:57	Let me guess-- cash, no cameras.
583	00:31:57	00:31:59	You got it. Thank you.
584	00:31:59	00:32:00	Any luck?
585	00:32:00	00:32:02	Uh, Wolf's phone has gone silent.
586	00:32:02	00:32:04	No activity since last night around midnight.
587	00:32:04	00:32:06	Time of the murder.
588	00:32:06	00:32:10	Yeah, and his call detail records have come in.
589	00:32:10	00:32:12	The phone was activated ten weeks ago.
590	00:32:12	00:32:14	Since then, it's been used around the Greater Vegas area.
591	00:32:14	00:32:21	90% of all the activity occurred 00 p.m. and 6 Sounds like our werewolf works nights.
592	00:32:21	00:32:23	And he definitely has a routine.
593	00:32:23	00:32:27	Every Monday night, his phone pings off of the tower in Henderson.
594	00:32:27	00:32:29	On Tuesdays he's in Spring Valley.
595	00:32:29	00:32:32	Helen's plane ticket was purchased in Henderson on a Monday.
596	00:32:32	00:32:34	And the phone in Spring Valley on a Tuesday.
597	00:32:34	00:32:37	Where was The Wolf last night?
598	00:32:37	00:32:41	On Wednesday he was just off the Strip near the airport.
599	00:32:42	00:32:47	When I was 15, I tried to make a fake I.D. using pencil, chalk and hair spray.
600	00:32:47	00:32:51	If I had had one that was this good, I could've gotten into any bar I wanted.
601	00:32:51	00:32:54	When you were 15, you probably looked more like you were 12.
602	00:32:54	00:32:57	And not even a letter from your dad would've gotten you in.
603	00:32:57	00:33:01	Well, Helen Morrison's fake license isn't even a license.
604	00:33:01	00:33:03	Official DMV licenses aren't chipped.
605	00:33:03	00:33:06	And I found an RFID chip in hers.
606	00:33:06	00:33:09	Common in security badges like ours.
607	00:33:09	00:33:10	So where do you get one of those?
608	00:33:10	00:33:12	The county prints ours.
609	00:33:12	00:33:13	For casinos and large companies, they make their own.
610	00:33:13	00:33:16	And there are a couple dozen businesses around town that print them.
611	00:33:16	00:33:19	So the Wolf had access to blank security cards and a printer.
612	00:33:19	00:33:21	Not just any printer.
613	00:33:21	00:33:24	This is a quality print job from a top-of-the-line digital printer.
614	00:33:24	00:33:27	Which narrows it down to only a dozen facilities.
615	00:33:30	00:33:34	Slots of Luck Industries, Varlos Boulevard.
616	00:33:34	00:33:37	We have his phone pinging off the tower in North Las Vegas.
617	00:33:37	00:33:40	North Las Vegas means he was there on Friday.
618	00:33:49	00:33:52	We were the first company in Vegas to get the Lazgan.
619	00:33:52	00:33:55	Better printer means I can charge more for jobs.
620	00:33:55	00:33:56	We don't print driver's licenses.
621	00:33:56	00:33:58	Yeah, but could you if you wanted to?
622	00:33:58	00:33:59	It's against the law.
623	00:33:59	00:34:01	It's not a trick question.
624	00:34:01	00:34:02	Is your machine capable of printing this?
625	00:34:02	00:34:04	Technically, yes.
626	00:34:04	00:34:06	I print all our employee I.D. badges.
627	00:34:06	00:34:12	So, to make a driver's license, it's just a matter of downloading the template and uploading a photo.
628	00:34:12	00:34:15	But it's against the law. But it's against the law.
629	00:34:15	00:34:18	We have reason to believe that someone printed this license on that machine.
630	00:34:18	00:34:21	If it was one of my employees, that's cause for termination.
631	00:34:21	00:34:23	How about outside normal business hours?
632	00:34:23	00:34:25	Only my security guard has access.
633	00:34:25	00:34:27	But George has been with us forever.
634	00:34:27	00:34:28	Does he work Friday nights?
635	00:34:28	00:34:30	Yes.
636	00:34:30	00:34:32	And the cleaning crew.
637	00:34:32	00:34:34	They're here every Friday.
638	00:34:36	00:34:38	Hey, Stokes.
639	00:34:38	00:34:40	Hooked you up with some rougher customers.
640	00:34:42	00:34:44	Oh, yeah.
641	00:34:48	00:34:52	Scoot over for me, will you, boys?
642	00:34:52	00:34:53	Thanks.
643	00:34:57	00:34:59	What's up?
644	00:34:59	00:35:00	I'm in a lot of trouble because of you.
645	00:35:00	00:35:02	Because of me?
646	00:35:02	00:35:06	I'm not the one that made you smoke dope, get all dumb and endanger planeloads of people.
647	00:35:06	00:35:09	My dad took my car away. Oh.
648	00:35:09	00:35:14	And that guy said that I'm looking at 4,000 hours of community service.
649	00:35:14	00:35:19	Could be staring at a felony. Or you could be sharing a cell with this fella right here.
650	00:35:19	00:35:20	You'd like that, wouldn't you?
651	00:35:20	00:35:23	See there? you're already making friends.
652	00:35:23	00:35:25	No... (clears throat)
653	00:35:25	00:35:32	Now, I can't really do anything about your old man, but I might be able to shave a few thousand hours of community service off.
654	00:35:32	00:35:39	What do I have to do? Last night, air traffic control reported 25.
655	00:35:39	00:35:45	That puts you at the end of the runway when my victim was thrown out of a moving car.
656	00:35:45	00:35:46	What'd you see?
657	00:35:46	00:35:48	(laughs) I don't know.
658	00:35:48	00:35:51	There was lots of planes.
659	00:35:51	00:35:53	Uh, a f... a few cars.
660	00:35:53	00:35:56	Then a-a lot of cops.
661	00:35:56	00:35:57	You...
662	00:35:57	00:36:00	were there.
663	00:36:02	00:36:03	4,000 hours of community service.
664	00:36:03	00:36:07	That's like being busy every weekend for the next ten years, so...
665	00:36:07	00:36:09	Come-come on, man, listen... (groans)
666	00:36:09	00:36:13	I was really stoned, man.
667	00:36:13	00:36:18	I mean, help me out, guys-- even when you're really stoned, you notice if a car's going too fast.
668	00:36:18	00:36:19	Or if it's swerving.
669	00:36:19	00:36:21	A woman's dead.
670	00:36:21	00:36:23	You realize that, right?
671	00:36:23	00:36:25	Yeah. Okay, so think.
672	00:36:25	00:36:27	If it wasn't a car, maybe it was something else.
673	00:36:27	00:36:29	Maybe it was something bigger.
674	00:36:29	00:36:31	Oh, there-there was this guy.
675	00:36:31	00:36:32	Um...
676	00:36:32	00:36:35	a farmer with a pitchfork.
677	00:36:35	00:36:37	Farmer with a pitchfork at the end of the tarmac?
678	00:36:37	00:36:40	Well, no, like, not... He wasn't a... Why?
679	00:36:40	00:36:42	You can have a seat right here. Well, I was...
680	00:36:42	00:36:43	Why don't you two guys get to know each other? Well...
681	00:36:43	00:36:47	He says there's a farmer with a pitchfork at the end of the tarmac?
682	00:36:47	00:36:49	No... (laughs)
683	00:36:49	00:36:52	Not a... He's not a real guy.
684	00:36:52	00:36:53	It was... He was a cartoon.
685	00:36:53	00:36:55	Okay. No!
686	00:36:55	00:36:58	No, it was on... it was on a side of a van!
687	00:36:58	00:37:00	It looked like a farmer with a pitchfork.
688	00:37:00	00:37:04	Only it was, uh, it was some moron with a mop.
689	00:37:07	00:37:09	Moron with a mop?
690	00:37:09	00:37:10	Yeah.
691	00:37:12	00:37:14	Was it that moron?
692	00:37:16	00:37:17	Yeah.
693	00:37:17	00:37:19	That's him.
694	00:37:20	00:37:24	So, a witness places your van at the crime scene at the time of Helen's murder.
695	00:37:24	00:37:26	And Truxton Travel I.D.'d you from a photo.
696	00:37:26	00:37:29	That's the travel agency where you bought a plane ticket for Helen.
697	00:37:29	00:37:35	And we know that you printed Helen's fake license at Slots of Luck where you used to work every Friday night.
698	00:37:35	00:37:37	Yeah, well, I-I was...
699	00:37:37	00:37:39	I was trying to help her.
700	00:37:39	00:37:41	I loved Helen.
701	00:37:41	00:37:44	So you made up some fake hero named The Wolf?
702	00:37:44	00:37:47	She was terrified that her husband was gonna kill us both.
703	00:37:47	00:37:49	So, she didn't want me involved.
704	00:37:49	00:37:50	But I wasn't gonna turn my back...
705	00:37:50	00:37:52	You weren't gonna turn your back on her money.
706	00:37:52	00:37:53	It wasn't her money.
707	00:37:53	00:37:54	It was Allen's money.
708	00:37:54	00:37:55	Yeah, $30,000, right?
709	00:37:55	00:37:59	Now, was that the amount that The Wolf told Helen it would cost to start her new life?
710	00:37:59	00:38:04	Or was 30K the number that Helen said that she could get her hands on?
711	00:38:04	00:38:08	It wasn't like that.
712	00:38:08	00:38:09	She was getting a fresh start.
713	00:38:09	00:38:10	And, yeah...
714	00:38:10	00:38:14	I was getting the money, but I was also getting my girl.
715	00:38:16	00:38:18	Hey!
716	00:38:18	00:38:20	What are you doing here?
717	00:38:20	00:38:23	How did you know I'd be here? I'm meeting The Wolf.
718	00:38:23	00:38:25	You can't be here! Change of plans. Get in.
719	00:38:25	00:38:27	No, you heard what he said. We can't be seen together.
720	00:38:27	00:38:28	It's all right. He called me. Come on.
721	00:38:28	00:38:30	Everything is going wrong.
722	00:38:30	00:38:32	No, Helen, everything's gonna be fine, all right?
723	00:38:32	00:38:33	Just get in.
724	00:38:33	00:38:35	I'm gonna take you to the motel.
725	00:38:35	00:38:38	And then I'm gonna bring The Wolf his money.
726	00:38:38	00:38:40	I don't have it.
727	00:38:41	00:38:43	Someone stole it. Stole it?
728	00:38:43	00:38:44	In my carry-on, on the plane.
729	00:38:44	00:38:46	Someone stole it!
730	00:38:46	00:38:47	No, you don't understand.
731	00:38:47	00:38:49	The Wolf needs his money.
732	00:38:49	00:38:51	He can't help you without the money.
733	00:38:51	00:38:52	Where is The Wolf? Where is The Wolf?
734	00:38:52	00:38:54	I need to talk to The Wolf.
735	00:38:54	00:38:56	So, there was no Wolf.
736	00:38:56	00:38:57	There was no happy ending.
737	00:38:57	00:38:59	It was all about the money.
738	00:38:59	00:39:00	You killed her.
739	00:39:01	00:39:02	You're as bad as her husband.
740	00:39:03	00:39:05	Look, you're right.
741	00:39:05	00:39:09	I-I-I-I was upset about the money, and I-I lost my cool.
742	00:39:09	00:39:11	But I loved Helen.
743	00:39:11	00:39:14	I-I was planning a life with her.
744	00:39:14	00:39:19	And when I told her that there was no Wolf, she freaked out.
745	00:39:19	00:39:21	I trusted you!
746	00:39:21	00:39:25	How could you do this to me?!
747	00:39:25	00:39:26	You just wanted the money. What?
748	00:39:26	00:39:28	You were never gonna help me.
749	00:39:28	00:39:30	No, Helen, that is not true.
750	00:39:30	00:39:32	You told me to leave my husband.
751	00:39:32	00:39:33	You told me I would be safe!
752	00:39:33	00:39:35	Allen's gonna kill me.
753	00:39:35	00:39:37	Allen's gonna find me and he's gonna kill me.
754	00:39:37	00:39:38	No, Helen...
755	00:39:38	00:39:39	Pull over, stop the car.
756	00:39:39	00:39:40	No, no! Stop the car!
757	00:39:40	00:39:41	No, oh, my God! Just stop the car!
758	00:39:41	00:39:42	God! Helen!
759	00:39:42	00:39:43	Helen!, no! Stop the car!
760	00:39:43	00:39:45	No! Oh, my God!
761	00:39:45	00:39:46	Stop the car and pull over! Aah!
762	00:39:46	00:39:47	No, no, stop it!
763	00:39:47	00:39:49	Get down! Stop the car!
764	00:39:49	00:39:50	My God, you're gonna kill us both!
765	00:39:50	00:39:52	Let me out! Just let me out!
766	00:39:52	00:39:53	I need to get out! Helen! Oh, my God, no!
767	00:39:53	00:39:54	I need to get... No!
768	00:39:54	00:39:55	Let go of me!
769	00:39:55	00:39:58	Stop it!
770	00:39:59	00:40:02	I am done with that.
771	00:40:05	00:40:06	No one hits me!
772	00:40:06	00:40:08	No! (screams)
773	00:40:08	00:40:09	No!
774	00:40:09	00:40:11	Sit down! (screaming)
775	00:40:11	00:40:12	Helen! (Helen screams)
776	00:40:15	00:40:16	I didn't mean to hurt her.
777	00:40:16	00:40:21	So you pushed her out of a van going 45 miles an hour.
778	00:40:21	00:40:24	And kept on driving.
779	00:40:24	00:40:25	I loved her.
780	00:40:25	00:40:26	No, you didn't.
781	00:40:26	00:40:32	If you did, Jefferson, you would've pulled over.
782	00:40:42	00:40:44	Call a cab?
783	00:40:44	00:40:46	Thanks for getting my money back.
784	00:40:46	00:40:48	Or what was left of it.
785	00:40:48	00:40:51	Either way it was the cheapest divorce I ever had.
786	00:40:52	00:40:57	You know, you can convince yourself all day long that you came down here chasing after that money.
787	00:40:57	00:40:59	But we both know the truth, don't we?
788	00:40:59	00:41:02	Look, the-the truth is...
789	00:41:02	00:41:04	is that Helen got what she deserved.
790	00:41:04	00:41:07	Really? Okay, um, you know what?
791	00:41:07	00:41:08	You can take off, bro.
792	00:41:08	00:41:10	Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's my cab.
793	00:41:10	00:41:11	No, no, that was your cab.
794	00:41:11	00:41:14	Hey, what the hell's going on here?
795	00:41:14	00:41:15	Get your hands off of me!
796	00:41:15	00:41:18	I am placing you under arrest for felony assault.
797	00:41:18	00:41:21	And in Nevada, that carries, what, three to 13?
798	00:41:21	00:41:23	I never touched her in Nevada.
799	00:41:23	00:41:24	No, no, I'm not talking about your ex-wife.
800	00:41:24	00:41:28	I'm talking about my medical examiner, Doc Robbins.
801	00:41:28	00:41:30	The guy on crutches that you pushed.
802	00:41:30	00:41:32	Oh, come on, man!
803	00:41:32	00:41:34	That's like hitting a cop. Are you joking?
804	00:41:34	00:41:35	The judge is gonna laugh you out of court.
805	00:41:35	00:41:39	Maybe he will, maybe he won't, but it's, like, 00 on a Friday afternoon.
806	00:41:39	00:41:41	Nothing's gonna happen till Monday morning.
807	00:41:45	00:41:46	Have a good weekend.
