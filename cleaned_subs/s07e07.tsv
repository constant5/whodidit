0	00:01:49	00:01:52	Her name is Penny Garden.
1	00:01:52	00:01:54	Age 65.
2	00:01:54	00:01:56	Retired cocktail waitress.
3	00:01:56	00:01:59	Been living here since the Rat Pack days.
4	00:01:59	00:02:01	She may have served them drinks.
5	00:02:01	00:02:05	Well, they must have tipped well because 20 years ago, this was a nice neighborhood.
6	00:02:05	00:02:07	Anyway, a guy next door heard a racket, called 911.
7	00:02:07	00:02:10	Down the hallway, there's a spare bedroom.
8	00:02:10	00:02:11	The bed's unmade.
9	00:02:11	00:02:16	So if the vic had a houseguest, they're nowhere to be found, so I'm going to dig around.
10	00:02:19	00:02:23	Unfortunately, these windows aren't tempered.
11	00:02:23	00:02:25	Very dangerous if broken.
12	00:02:27	00:02:29	And she went through face first.
13	00:02:29	00:02:33	The door's right here-- I doubt she missed it.
14	00:02:33	00:02:36	Maybe she had some help.
15	00:02:36	00:02:37	God.
16	00:02:38	00:02:44	Those coupons on the floor on top of the glass suggests they were scattered after the window broke.
17	00:02:45	00:02:46	Maybe they went through the room after they killed her.
18	00:02:47	00:02:50	There's nothing particularly valuable here.
19	00:02:52	00:02:54	There used to be.
20	00:03:28	00:03:33	Control, Control, this is CSI Sanders. I need some help.
21	00:03:33	00:03:34	Control, go with the information.
22	00:03:34	00:03:35	Assault in progress.
23	00:03:35	00:03:37	How many suspects? Are they armed?
24	00:03:37	00:03:39	Ma'am, please, they gotta get here quicker than this.
25	00:03:41	00:03:42	Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
26	00:03:42	00:03:47	My name is Pete Athens. I am the coroner of Clark County; I want to thank you all for being here.
27	00:03:47	00:03:52	Coroner inquests go back to medieval times during the reign of Richard I in England.
28	00:03:52	00:03:55	In fact, coroner comes from the word crown.
29	00:03:55	00:04:00	A public inquest was one of the crown's checks and balances on the powers of the sheriff.
30	00:04:00	00:04:10	And today, a thousand years later, it serves the same purpose in our county-- checks and balances on the sheriff and for those who work for him.
31	00:04:11	00:04:13	The Honorable Clayton Trueblood will be our hearing master.
32	00:04:13	00:04:17	He's not a judge, but he's going to be more like a, um...
33	00:04:17	00:04:22	a traffic cop, because an inquest isn't a trial.
34	00:04:22	00:04:25	We're going to examine the death of Demetrius James.
35	00:04:25	00:04:33	The assistant district attorney Valerie Nichols will present the facts in the case, introduce the witnesses and ask them questions.
36	00:04:33	00:04:38	Any member of the jury may also ask questions, either orally or in writing.
37	00:04:38	00:04:43	I understand that there are family members of the deceased present.
38	00:04:53	00:05:01	I'm very sorry for your loss, and I want you to know that as what the state calls interested parties, you may ask questions, too.
39	00:05:01	00:05:12	When all the facts have been presented, the jury will then rule the death in question as either justifiable, excusable or criminal.
40	00:05:13	00:05:15	Cut's pretty deep.
41	00:05:15	00:05:17	Let's try and keep her head on while we move her.
42	00:05:17	00:05:21	One, two, three.
43	00:05:34	00:05:35	Hi.
44	00:05:35	00:05:38	Grissom said you could use some help.
45	00:05:38	00:05:40	What haven't you done?
46	00:05:40	00:05:42	The rest of the house.
47	00:06:37	00:06:39	Hope I die before I get old.
48	00:06:41	00:06:45	Man, I was just lampin' in the crib with my boys when all of a sudden, psssh.
49	00:06:45	00:06:47	I thought someone was breaking in next door.
50	00:06:47	00:06:50	Took a look over the fence, old Penny was breaking out.
51	00:06:50	00:06:53	Did you hear anything? Any voices, yelling, screaming?
52	00:06:53	00:06:57	Mm-mm. I don't even think Mrs. Penny could scream.
53	00:06:57	00:06:59	She had, like, a real low, raspy voice.
54	00:06:59	00:07:02	Yeah. Well, you think that's sexy?
55	00:07:02	00:07:04	Is that the way you roll?
56	00:07:04	00:07:05	Huh?
57	00:07:05	00:07:08	All right, I'll take that for a no. You see anybody leave the house?
58	00:07:08	00:07:10	No, sir. Not last night.
59	00:07:10	00:07:12	Who's she got staying with her?
60	00:07:12	00:07:14	Don't know his name, but I seen him always going in and out of there.
61	00:07:14	00:07:16	Describe him.
62	00:07:16	00:07:17	White dude. Skinny.
63	00:07:17	00:07:20	Always wears jeans and white tees.
64	00:07:20	00:07:24	Man.
65	00:07:25	00:07:26	I liked that old lady.
66	00:07:26	00:07:30	She made some good victuals and always had an extra stogie if I was out.
67	00:07:30	00:07:31	This is my card.
68	00:07:31	00:07:35	If you see that white skinny guy, give me a call, will you? Yeah.
69	00:07:35	00:07:36	All right? Yeah.
70	00:07:41	00:07:45	You talk to that guy in that house?
71	00:07:45	00:07:47	Been there twice. Still nobody home.
72	00:07:47	00:07:50	Put someone on his doorstep until he shows.
73	00:07:50	00:07:52	He's got security cameras. I want the video.
74	00:07:52	00:08:00	The first attack that night occurred just after midnight, in the employee parking structure at the Golden Sapphire Hotel.
75	00:08:00	00:08:08	A group of youths ranging from teens to early 20s attacked Vasco Ruiz, a hotel dishwasher on his way to his car.
76	00:08:08	00:08:11	He was apparently selected at random.
77	00:08:17	00:08:20	Mr. Ruiz was found dead at the scene.
78	00:08:20	00:08:23	And what was the mob's next move?
79	00:08:23	00:08:32	Approximately 30 minutes after the first attack, not far away, at the Holiday Motel, they attacked their next victim, Jessica Hershbaum.
80	00:08:32	00:08:34	Stop it! Stop it!
81	00:08:36	00:08:38	Now, Miss Hershbaum survived.
82	00:08:38	00:08:40	She's alive.
83	00:08:40	00:08:48	But she has physical and emotional scars from the attack that she may never recover from.
84	00:08:48	00:08:53	So when Mr. Sanders was coming to your crime scene, would he have known about these first two swarming attacks?
85	00:08:53	00:08:54	Absolutely.
86	00:08:54	00:09:04	CSI was still processing those crime scenes, and then I heard on my radio about another attack-- the third that night-- and that a CSI was one of the victims.
87	00:09:05	00:09:07	Is this the location of the third swarming attack?
88	00:09:07	00:09:08	Yes.
89	00:09:08	00:09:10	I drove over there immediately.
90	00:09:10	00:09:11	And what did you find?
91	00:09:12	00:09:14	Three men, all seriously injured.
92	00:09:14	00:09:20	Stanley Tanner was unconscious, as was Demetrius James.
93	00:09:20	00:09:25	The mob had pulled CSI Sanders from his vehicle and beaten him.
94	00:09:27	00:09:29	But it was his intervention that saved Stanley Tanner's life.
95	00:09:40	00:09:45	While I appreciate your participation in the process here, I don't find this question relevant.
96	00:09:45	00:09:47	Excuse me, Your Honor.
97	00:09:47	00:09:48	The question's quite relevant.
98	00:09:48	00:09:54	Are we just going through the motions here, so it looks like someone actually asked whether or not it's okay to run over black kids in the street?
99	00:09:55	00:09:56	Do you have a question, sir?
100	00:09:56	00:09:57	Yeah.
101	00:09:57	00:10:00	Are you also going to be censoring verbal questions?
102	00:10:00	00:10:04	Relevance is at my discretion here.
103	00:10:04	00:10:06	Now, please, take your seat.
104	00:10:17	00:10:27	Multiple lacerations on face, neck shoulders-- if it weren't for the couple dozen glass fragments I tweezed out, I'd say somebody went to town on her with a straight razor.
105	00:10:27	00:10:36	C.O.D. is exsanguination due to sharp force injury to the jugular-carotid complex, but she was already on her way out.
106	00:10:36	00:10:39	Cannonballs of tumors on her lungs.
107	00:10:40	00:10:42	Man... her cancer had cancer.
108	00:10:42	00:10:44	I guess she liked smoking more than living, huh?
109	00:10:44	00:10:47	Or else she wanted to die with a cigarette in her mouth.
110	00:10:47	00:10:55	You know, Catherine found antidepressants, laxatives, acid-reflux meds in her house, but I don't think she found anything for pain.
111	00:10:55	00:10:57	I guarantee you, this lady was in pain.
112	00:10:57	00:10:59	She must have been taking something for it.
113	00:10:59	00:11:02	Maybe the killer took it with him.
114	00:11:02	00:11:05	Well, there's a big market for that stuff now.
115	00:11:05	00:11:07	I'll get her medical records.
116	00:11:28	00:11:31	Did you find something?
117	00:11:31	00:11:33	Bloody glass.
118	00:11:35	00:11:37	The killer on his way out?
119	00:12:23	00:12:25	You can't keep me out of there!
120	00:12:25	00:12:26	This is where I live, man!
121	00:12:26	00:12:27	Sorry, son. This is a crime scene.
122	00:12:28	00:12:29	You don't want to be in there.
123	00:12:29	00:12:32	Look, I just want to see my Auntie Penny. Where is she? Calm... calm down.
124	00:12:32	00:12:33	I don't want to calm down!
125	00:12:33	00:12:35	Do you live here?
126	00:12:35	00:12:36	Yeah, that's what I was just telling this guy.
127	00:12:36	00:12:38	What's going on? What's your name?
128	00:12:38	00:12:40	Henry. Henry Briney.
129	00:12:40	00:12:44	Henry, I'm going to need you to come down to the police station, give us a statement.
130	00:12:44	00:12:45	For what?
131	00:12:45	00:12:47	Um...
132	00:12:47	00:12:50	Sorry to tell you, but your aunt is dead.
133	00:12:52	00:12:57	Mr. Tanner, can you tell us what injuries you sustained as a result of the attack?
134	00:12:57	00:13:01	Cuts, some of them pretty bad, mostly on my face.
135	00:13:01	00:13:09	Broke left arm, crushed windpipe, one eye socket cracked, broke right ankle.
136	00:13:09	00:13:13	And I got this headache they tell me might be permanent.
137	00:13:13	00:13:18	Would it be correct to say that while you were being attacked, you felt like your life was in danger?
138	00:13:18	00:13:20	Hell, yeah.
139	00:13:20	00:13:21	I have a question.
140	00:13:21	00:13:22	Go ahead.
141	00:13:22	00:13:27	Did you actually see Demetrius James attacking you?
142	00:13:27	00:13:29	Oh, I couldn't tell who was who.
143	00:13:29	00:13:31	I mean, hell, my hands were on my face.
144	00:13:31	00:13:33	I was just trying to stay alive.
145	00:13:33	00:13:39	If Mr. Sanders hadn't shown up just then, I'd have been like that first guy-- dead.
146	00:13:39	00:13:44	There was a large laceration where Demetrius James' head hit the ground when he fell.
147	00:13:44	00:13:50	Underlying that wound was a fracture of the occipital bone, which crosses at the base of the skull.
148	00:13:50	00:14:00	The motion of the impact caused the brain to collide with the bony protrusions inside the skull, resulting in what we call contra-coup contusions.
149	00:14:00	00:14:06	There was also prominent cerebral edema-- or swelling-- as well as hemorrhages of the brain stem.
150	00:14:07	00:14:10	So your official cause of death was...?
151	00:14:10	00:14:14	Blunt force trauma to the head following a motor vehicle collision.
152	00:14:14	00:14:16	So this was a death at the hands of another?
153	00:14:16	00:14:18	Yes.
154	00:14:18	00:14:20	And what do you call that kind of death?
155	00:14:22	00:14:25	A homicide.
156	00:14:30	00:14:33	So where did you go last night?
157	00:14:33	00:14:35	Movies.
158	00:14:35	00:14:37	Oh, a ticket stub. That's good.
159	00:14:37	00:14:39	Who'd you go with? You went by yourself?
160	00:14:39	00:14:40	Who else would I go with?
161	00:14:41	00:14:42	I don't know. A friend?
162	00:14:42	00:14:44	No. I don't have friends.
163	00:14:44	00:14:47	Okay, so the movie ended.
164	00:14:47	00:14:48	You're all by yourself, then what?
165	00:14:49	00:14:52	I sat in the keno lounge all night, hit the grocery store, and then came home to cops.
166	00:14:53	00:14:55	Why are you staying at your Aunt Penny's?
167	00:14:55	00:14:58	Because my parents threw me out.
168	00:14:58	00:15:00	Why would they do that?
169	00:15:00	00:15:03	Because they don't like me.
170	00:15:03	00:15:05	Let me see your arms.
171	00:15:08	00:15:11	Are you booting that good doodgie?
172	00:15:11	00:15:13	You ever use intravenous drugs?
173	00:15:13	00:15:16	Not anymore, but I did for a while.
174	00:15:16	00:15:22	You know, your Aunt Penny had some scrips for some pain medication-- oxycontin, fentanyl, methadone.
175	00:15:22	00:15:24	When we searched her house, we didn't find any.
176	00:15:25	00:15:26	Did you take them?
177	00:15:26	00:15:27	No, I didn't take them.
178	00:15:27	00:15:29	She must have taken them.
179	00:15:29	00:15:30	I don't touch them.
180	00:15:30	00:15:32	I just got out of rehab.
181	00:15:32	00:15:37	Haven't touched a pill, line or needle in six months.
182	00:15:37	00:15:40	My parents threw me out, and she took me in.
183	00:15:40	00:15:43	I would not screw her over.
184	00:15:43	00:15:47	We're going to need to take your clothes and your shoes.
185	00:16:00	00:16:01	Any luck?
186	00:16:01	00:16:02	No.
187	00:16:02	00:16:04	No blood on the nephew's shoes or clothes.
188	00:16:04	00:16:07	Drug panel on his urine came back negative.
189	00:16:07	00:16:08	He's clean.
190	00:16:08	00:16:10	What about Auntie Penny?
191	00:16:10	00:16:12	No pain meds in her system either.
192	00:16:12	00:16:16	We've got a lot of serious drugs that are unaccounted for.
193	00:16:16	00:16:23	These glass fragments are from the mob breaking out the windows of CSI Sanders' Denali.
194	00:16:23	00:16:26	That's how they dragged him out.
195	00:16:27	00:16:34	This is a clump of his hair, torn from his scalp.
196	00:16:34	00:16:38	And that's the rock Demetrius James used as a weapon.
197	00:16:38	00:16:41	According to who?
198	00:16:41	00:16:44	This is the first we've even heard that Demetrius James had a weapon.
199	00:16:44	00:16:48	In his report, Mr. Sanders testified to that fact.
200	00:16:48	00:16:49	The rock was found at the scene.
201	00:16:49	00:16:51	How do we know the cops didn't plant it there?
202	00:16:51	00:16:54	Sir, I've warned you.
203	00:16:54	00:16:55	I'd like to answer that question.
204	00:16:55	00:17:03	Usually, when someone plants a weapon, whoever did it puts it right beside the body-- in this case, the rock was found near the front tire of the Denali.
205	00:17:03	00:17:05	Skid marks suggest it was dropped upon impact.
206	00:17:05	00:17:08	A rock against two tons of steel.
207	00:17:08	00:17:12	No. More like one man against an extremely violent, out of control mob.
208	00:17:12	00:17:16	What's department policy in a situation like that?
209	00:17:16	00:17:22	It has always been department policy not to harm innocent civilians.
210	00:17:22	00:17:27	You call for backup, you try to be a good witness, and you stay out of the way.
211	00:17:27	00:17:30	So what makes it okay to start running over people?
212	00:17:30	00:17:34	Well, when those people are wearing masks, running around beating people up.
213	00:17:34	00:17:36	Man, D.J. was going to a costume party.
214	00:17:36	00:17:38	One victim was dead.
215	00:17:38	00:17:40	Another was seriously injured.
216	00:17:41	00:17:42	Another fatality imminent.
217	00:17:42	00:17:48	I'd say the use of deadly force in this case was consistent with department policy, absolutely.
218	00:17:48	00:17:52	Demetrius James was going to finish off the victim with the rock.
219	00:17:52	00:17:55	You're a liar! My brother wasn't a killer!
220	00:17:55	00:17:56	Excuse me.
221	00:17:56	00:17:58	Demetrius was going to college Mrs. James.
222	00:17:58	00:18:00	He had a 3.6 GPA.
223	00:18:01	00:18:03	We are all very sorry for your loss, but you are not a witness here.
224	00:18:03	00:18:05	You didn't know him! (shouting)
225	00:18:05	00:18:06	I do! We knew him!
226	00:18:06	00:18:09	Judge, can we have some order here?
227	00:18:09	00:18:12	You didn't run over a mob, you ran over one boy!
228	00:18:12	00:18:14	My boy!
229	00:18:19	00:18:21	Judge?
230	00:18:21	00:18:25	Mrs. James' comments give context to the events of the night in question.
231	00:18:25	00:18:28	I'd like to hear what she has to say.
232	00:18:30	00:18:33	Why is Trueblood letting her do this?
233	00:18:33	00:18:35	It's probably good for his campaign.
234	00:18:35	00:18:37	He's running for Assembly.
235	00:18:37	00:18:40	Now you tell me.
236	00:18:40	00:18:42	Got your page.
237	00:18:42	00:18:46	Surveillance footage from the neighborhood watch guy across the street.
238	00:18:46	00:18:49	Yeah, he was paranoid, but lazy.
239	00:18:49	00:18:53	Had four security cameras on his house, three of them were cardboard boxes.
240	00:18:53	00:18:55	Homemade security is the worst.
241	00:18:55	00:18:59	Okay, so the nephew comes in and out of the house a couple times during the day.
242	00:18:59	00:19:02	It's a whole different story next door.
243	00:19:04	00:19:13	Okay, this guy comes out of the house and meets with a different car at least three times and hour.
244	00:19:13	00:19:15	He's slinging drugs.
245	00:19:15	00:19:18	The white one is carisoprodol.
246	00:19:18	00:19:19	It's a muscle relaxant.
247	00:19:19	00:19:22	Yeah, I strained my pecs bench pressing.
248	00:19:22	00:19:24	Oh, yeah.
249	00:19:24	00:19:25	And the blue one is Prevalis.
250	00:19:26	00:19:28	You look a little young to need that.
251	00:19:28	00:19:31	Well, I've had my share of women.
252	00:19:31	00:19:33	Mr. Johnson's gotten bored over the years, so?
253	00:19:33	00:19:35	Well, he's going to get really bored in prison.
254	00:19:35	00:19:36	You hope.
255	00:19:36	00:19:38	What, you gonna bust me for selling Prevalis?
256	00:19:38	00:19:41	Well, you think a guy in my job doesn't know what goes on in the clubs and in the street?
257	00:19:41	00:19:43	You ever hear of a Las Vegas Cocktail.
258	00:19:43	00:19:45	I don't drink.
259	00:19:45	00:19:51	It's a combination of carisoprodol, Prevalis and very strong painkiller called fentanyl.
260	00:19:51	00:19:52	Problem is, fentanyl's hard to get.
261	00:19:52	00:19:59	I mean, doctors don't just give it away, you got to be in really serious pain to get it, like dying of cancer.
262	00:19:59	00:20:02	On the street it's called perc-a-pop.
263	00:20:02	00:20:04	Now, Penny Garden was prescribed 40 a month.
264	00:20:04	00:20:06	Problem is, we couldn't find any in her house.
265	00:20:06	00:20:08	So what, you think I stole them?
266	00:20:08	00:20:09	Yeah, I do.
267	00:20:11	00:20:12	Where are the pops, old lady?
268	00:20:12	00:20:14	Get out of my house.
269	00:20:14	00:20:15	Where are they?
270	00:20:16	00:20:17	I'll call the police.
271	00:20:17	00:20:19	No you won't.
272	00:20:21	00:20:22	Never.
273	00:20:22	00:20:23	Never, never, never.
274	00:20:23	00:20:25	Look, I told you, I liked the lady.
275	00:20:25	00:20:27	She made me dinner. She lent me smokes, man.
276	00:20:27	00:20:29	You liked her 'cause she had what you needed.
277	00:20:29	00:20:31	No, man. No way.
278	00:20:31	00:20:34	Hey, I need a lawyer in here.
279	00:20:34	00:20:38	So we have a drug dealer and a former drug user, both of which would have motive to steal Penny's drugs.
280	00:20:38	00:20:41	Well, there wasn't any trace of fentanyl in the nephew's system.
281	00:20:41	00:20:45	He's broke, he's unemployed, maybe he's stealing them Penny so he can sell them to the neighbor.
282	00:20:45	00:20:47	If that's the case, it's motive for both.
283	00:20:47	00:20:48	Excuse me.
284	00:20:48	00:20:50	Hi, Henry.
285	00:20:50	00:20:51	What are you doing here?
286	00:20:52	00:20:57	Um... I just found this on my porch-- I opened it and thought I should bring it down to you guys.
287	00:20:57	00:21:00	It's... pretty creepy.
288	00:21:36	00:21:38	If one was horrifying...
289	00:21:40	00:21:42	...what is two?
290	00:21:42	00:21:45	Possible serial killer.
291	00:21:45	00:21:49	I'd say that it takes the nephew and the neighbor off the hook.
292	00:21:49	00:21:53	I doubt either one of them could afford a mini-contractor, anyway.
293	00:22:06	00:22:07	A bloody doll.
294	00:22:07	00:22:11	Similar to the one in the other miniature.
295	00:22:14	00:22:18	Look at the blood on the doll's forehead.
296	00:22:18	00:22:19	Same pattern on both.
297	00:22:19	00:22:23	Could be two different views of the same subject.
298	00:22:23	00:22:25	Maybe it's a signature.
299	00:22:25	00:22:26	Yeah, but we have no context.
300	00:22:26	00:22:28	It could mean or represent just about anything.
301	00:22:28	00:22:30	Okay...
302	00:22:30	00:22:40	again, the miniature suggests that the killer had an intimate familiarity with victim, home and habits.
303	00:22:40	00:22:43	So what do they have in common?
304	00:22:43	00:22:49	Izzy Delancy, 50-year-old white male, washed-up rock star.
305	00:22:49	00:22:53	Penny Garden, cancer-stricken retiree.
306	00:22:53	00:22:56	Different friends, different family, different social circles.
307	00:22:56	00:23:00	Why wasn't this one left at the crime scene like that one?
308	00:23:12	00:23:16	Marla and Aaron James are not sworn witnesses.
309	00:23:16	00:23:25	If they were, they couldn't be in the courtroom during testimony and that would effectively take away their rights as interested parties to question witnesses.
310	00:23:26	00:23:29	So please try to remember that their remarks are not evidence.
311	00:23:29	00:23:32	Go ahead.
312	00:23:35	00:23:39	My sons didn't grow up with a father.
313	00:23:39	00:23:41	Barely had a mother...
314	00:23:41	00:23:44	on account of me working all the time.
315	00:23:44	00:23:47	They got into trouble.
316	00:23:47	00:23:49	Mostly 'cause of where we live.
317	00:23:49	00:23:52	Aaron here, he got into a whole lot of trouble.
318	00:23:52	00:23:53	And I did my time, too.
319	00:23:53	00:23:57	I did my time, but that wasn't D.J.
320	00:23:57	00:23:59	He was helping me turn my life around.
321	00:23:59	00:24:03	Coached me on my GED.
322	00:24:03	00:24:07	Made me feel like there was a chance for me, you know.
323	00:24:09	00:24:12	Man, you have no idea what you killed when you killed my brother.
324	00:24:16	00:24:25	Everyone was moved by the compelling testimony... Today, in the courthouse, ...of the victim's mother... it wasn't the judge, the jury or the lawyer, instead it was the mother, of Demitrius James that had the courtroom asking did her her son behave...
325	00:24:25	00:24:27	Hey.
326	00:24:27	00:24:28	Nichols was right.
327	00:24:28	00:24:30	This isn't a trial, it's a circus.
328	00:24:30	00:24:33	Yeah, I heard. Starring the mother.
329	00:24:38	00:24:41	I feel like I should say something.
330	00:24:41	00:24:42	Like what?
331	00:24:42	00:24:44	I don't know. Sorry?
332	00:24:45	00:24:51	You going to apologize to the mother of a guy who beat one man to death and was trying to do the same to you?
333	00:24:51	00:24:55	That's as good as saying you're guilty and setting yourself up for one hell of a civil suit besides.
334	00:24:55	00:24:57	You did nothing wrong.
335	00:24:57	00:25:00	I just want to be able to sleep again.
336	00:25:00	00:25:06	We put ourselves in harm's way every single day and sometimes, we pay one hell of a price for surviving it.
337	00:25:06	00:25:09	Other people will never understand that.
338	00:25:11	00:25:13	No way D.J. was a violent person.
339	00:25:13	00:25:16	My son is not a killer.
340	00:25:16	00:25:18	He was trying to stop that killing.
341	00:26:32	00:26:35	Hey. Hey.
342	00:26:35	00:26:37	How'd it go in there?
343	00:26:37	00:26:39	I don't know.
344	00:26:39	00:26:41	Really? Yeah.
345	00:26:41	00:26:49	You know, I know it was a hardcore situation that Greg ran up on, but you think it ever would have occurred to him to just put it in reverse and get the hell out of there?
346	00:26:49	00:26:52	Well, that's not the question.
347	00:26:52	00:26:58	What a jury wants to know is did Greg do what any reasonable person would have done under the circumstances.
348	00:26:58	00:27:00	I know Greg must have been scared as hell, man.
349	00:27:01	00:27:03	What can we do to help him?
350	00:27:03	00:27:06	We'll put the jury behind the wheel of the car.
351	00:27:59	00:28:04	All right, the Denali's black box reports only five seconds before impact.
352	00:28:04	00:28:09	Now, Greg was idling with his foot on the brake.
353	00:28:09	00:28:12	And then he accelerated for no more than two seconds.
354	00:28:12	00:28:21	Yeah, according to the acceleration skid marks, the front end went from there to there with D.J. coming at him.
355	00:28:21	00:28:23	Want to give it a go?
356	00:28:23	00:28:25	Take it for a spin? Yeah.
357	00:28:37	00:28:39	You ready?
358	00:28:39	00:28:40	Ready.
359	00:28:40	00:28:41	Go.
360	00:28:43	00:28:45	Stop.
361	00:28:50	00:28:55	With this kid running at him the whole time, there's no way Greg could have avoided hitting him.
362	00:28:55	00:28:58	You think a jury will see it that way?
363	00:29:18	00:29:22	How tough you feel when you're not in your big SUV, huh?
364	00:29:24	00:29:27	I asked you a question, killer.
365	00:29:36	00:29:38	Excuse me.
366	00:29:50	00:29:57	In the cause now pending before this court, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
367	00:29:57	00:29:58	I do.
368	00:29:58	00:30:01	Be seated.
369	00:30:01	00:30:04	All right, let's take a look at the official transcript of your call for backup.
370	00:30:04	00:30:09	54 and 21 seconds, Dispatch Control answers.
371	00:30:09	00:30:12	Would you please read your response.
372	00:30:12	00:30:15	Control, Control, this is CSI Sanders.
373	00:30:15	00:30:16	I need some help.
374	00:30:16	00:30:19	You took a couple of seconds to look at the street signs.
375	00:30:19	00:30:26	There's a few more exchanges Closest unit has a five minute ETA.
376	00:30:26	00:30:28	Five minutes.
377	00:30:30	00:30:34	Control continues-- Rolling Code 3. Are they armed?
378	00:30:34	00:30:35	Please read your response.
379	00:30:35	00:30:36	I don't know, I don't know.
380	00:30:36	00:30:39	They gotta get here quicker than this.
381	00:30:39	00:30:40	Copy that.
382	00:30:43	00:30:45	What'd you do?
383	00:30:45	00:30:49	I thought I'd try to break up the mob.
384	00:30:49	00:30:54	I turned into the alley, hit the horn, yelled, anything.
385	00:30:54	00:30:56	Did that stop the beating?
386	00:30:56	00:30:57	Not entirely.
387	00:30:57	00:30:59	One guy decided not to run away.
388	00:30:59	00:31:03	Instead, he turned around, picked up a rock...
389	00:31:03	00:31:07	and moved like he was going to finish off the victim.
390	00:31:07	00:31:12	But he turned and started coming at me with it.
391	00:31:12	00:31:13	Oh, come on, that's just his word, man.
392	00:31:14	00:31:16	His word against my brother's word! Mr. James.
393	00:31:16	00:31:19	You know, we can't get his side, now can we? All right. Your Honor?
394	00:31:19	00:31:22	Ms. Nichols, the man has a right to speak.
395	00:31:23	00:31:25	Sit down. Come on.
396	00:31:29	00:31:32	At this point, did you fear for your life?
397	00:31:32	00:31:33	Yes.
398	00:31:33	00:31:35	Did you have a weapon, a gun?
399	00:31:35	00:31:36	No.
400	00:31:36	00:31:43	What were you thinking when D.J. left Stanley Tanner's unconscious body and ran at you with that rock?
401	00:31:43	00:31:46	I thought that he could make me his next target.
402	00:31:46	00:31:50	I thought he wanted to kill me.
403	00:31:50	00:31:53	No matter what, I knew that I had to incapacitate him.
404	00:31:55	00:31:59	Now it's taken us several minutes to go through the events of that night.
405	00:31:59	00:32:03	And I'm sure that you've all formed some kind of opinion about what happened.
406	00:32:03	00:32:09	But, right now, let's put ourselves in Mr. Sanders' position.
407	00:32:09	00:32:14	Let's see how much time Greg had to save a man's life.
408	00:32:29	00:32:30	Seconds.
409	00:32:31	00:32:34	Mere seconds.
410	00:32:34	00:32:36	What would you have done?
411	00:32:38	00:32:44	Mr. Sanders, was it your intention to kill Demitrius James?
412	00:32:44	00:32:46	No.
413	00:32:48	00:32:51	I wish he hadn't come at me.
414	00:32:51	00:32:54	I wish that he had just run away.
415	00:32:58	00:33:00	Mr. Sanders...
416	00:33:00	00:33:02	aren't you leaving something out?
417	00:33:02	00:33:04	I don't think so.
418	00:33:04	00:33:09	You testified at a criminal trial earlier that day, didn't you?
419	00:33:09	00:33:11	Yes.
420	00:33:11	00:33:15	A.D.A. Ulrich must've been pleased with your testimony.
421	00:33:15	00:33:19	She took you to dinner at the Tillerman.
422	00:33:19	00:33:22	I'm looking at a copy of her credit card receipt.
423	00:33:22	00:33:25	How was the sea bass?
424	00:33:25	00:33:31	And the bottle of Pinot Grigio Santa Margherita 2005, how was that?
425	00:33:31	00:33:32	Your Honor...
426	00:33:32	00:33:46	I... wasn't on shift, and I only had... Mr. Sanders, I'm sure the jury's wondering, if you hadn't been drinking before going to work, would Demitrius James still be alive?
427	00:33:50	00:33:52	Alcohol wasn't...
428	00:33:52	00:33:54	a factor.
429	00:33:54	00:33:59	A.D.A. Ulrich insisted on ordering the wine.
430	00:33:59	00:34:01	I drank half a glass.
431	00:34:01	00:34:02	About six ounces.
432	00:34:02	00:34:08	At my weight, 150, that would give me a blood-alcohol content of .02%.
433	00:34:08	00:34:16	Even without food, the alcohol burn-off rate would be .015% per hour...
434	00:34:16	00:34:29	meaning that there was no alcohol in my bloodstream after 90 minutes, well before I reported for my shift and about... seven hours before the incident.
435	00:34:35	00:34:41	This is where we found your aunt's fentanyl, so we know that you didn't take it.
436	00:34:41	00:34:44	Which means you've gone from a suspect...
437	00:34:44	00:34:45	To a witness.
438	00:34:45	00:34:49	Now it's up to you to help us find the real killer.
439	00:34:49	00:34:55	If you really cared about Penny, you'll tell us the truth about everything.
440	00:34:55	00:34:58	So this is off the record? Yeah.
441	00:34:58	00:35:01	So I ain't going to jail?
442	00:35:02	00:35:05	Yeah, what do you want to know?
443	00:35:05	00:35:08	Who was Penny hiding her drugs from?
444	00:35:08	00:35:09	I don't know.
445	00:35:09	00:35:11	Maybe it was me.
446	00:35:11	00:35:13	Although I never would've taken them.
447	00:35:13	00:35:15	Or maybe you should ask the guy next-door.
448	00:35:15	00:35:18	No, man, I'd never take those things from her.
449	00:35:18	00:35:20	I buy 'em, 50 bucks a pop.
450	00:35:27	00:35:30	Did you know your aunt was selling her drugs?
451	00:35:30	00:35:32	Yeah, I had an idea.
452	00:35:32	00:35:34	I figured it was how she was supporting her habit.
453	00:35:34	00:35:36	Which one?
454	00:35:36	00:35:38	I guess I should've said habits.
455	00:35:38	00:35:43	Um, she loved her liqueur, and she loved her cigarettes, but what she really loved was video poker.
456	00:35:43	00:35:47	She liked the sound the coins made when she hit a jackpot.
457	00:35:47	00:35:51	She offered me a couple of bucks a week to keep the house clean, and...
458	00:35:51	00:35:53	and she paid me in nickels and quarters.
459	00:35:53	00:35:55	Can you think...
460	00:35:55	00:36:00	of anyone else that might have known that those drugs were there?
461	00:36:00	00:36:05	No. I lived with her for a couple of months, and...
462	00:36:05	00:36:08	and she never had anyone over but me.
463	00:36:45	00:36:47	I know that look.
464	00:36:47	00:36:50	You just figured something out.
465	00:36:51	00:36:55	This is much better than dead rock star kitchen.
466	00:36:55	00:36:57	The whole al fresco thing?
467	00:36:57	00:36:59	Come on, share.
468	00:36:59	00:37:01	Please?
469	00:37:01	00:37:07	Look carefully at the back of the doll and at the pillow on the chair.
470	00:37:07	00:37:11	There appears to be remnants of glue on both.
471	00:37:11	00:37:17	So the doll was originally glued to the back of the chair.
472	00:37:18	00:37:24	I think the killer expected the victim to die in this chair.
473	00:37:38	00:37:42	Well, if that's the case, then how did the killer expect to...
474	00:37:42	00:37:44	kill her?
475	00:38:04	00:38:08	I understand the jury has reached a verdict?
476	00:38:08	00:38:10	We have, Your Honor.
477	00:38:11	00:38:16	We, the jury in this inquest, find the death of Demitrius James excusable.
478	00:38:23	00:38:26	Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, Judge Trueblood.
479	00:38:26	00:38:28	This inquest is concluded.
480	00:38:28	00:38:30	Excusa... No.
481	00:38:30	00:38:35	See, excusable is a lawful act with no intention to kill.
482	00:38:35	00:38:39	Justifiable means that the action was the only alternative.
483	00:38:39	00:38:41	That's what they should have found.
484	00:38:41	00:38:43	It's okay.
485	00:38:43	00:38:45	I think they may have it right.
486	00:38:45	00:38:51	Look, look, I got nothing against Mr. Sanders personally, but all these inquests ever really seem to do is protect the cops.
487	00:38:51	00:38:54	I'm just trying to speak for someone who can't speak for himself.
488	00:38:54	00:38:55	We should be in a criminal court...
489	00:38:55	00:38:59	...about any death at the hands of law enforcement.
490	00:38:59	00:39:00	The rights of the working people of...
491	00:39:00	00:39:02	Things have a way of working themselves out.
492	00:39:02	00:39:05	Mr. Sanders, Mr. Sanders, do you think the verdict was fair?
493	00:39:05	00:39:07	Was your killing Demitrius James excusable?
494	00:39:10	00:39:12	This kid saved my damn life.
495	00:39:12	00:39:16	He is a hero, a genuine hero.
496	00:40:37	00:40:39	Penny Garden was poisoned with nicotine.
497	00:40:39	00:40:43	Well, that's not exactly a surprise-- the woman smoked liked a chimney.
498	00:40:43	00:40:45	She didn't smoke it.
499	00:40:45	00:40:46	She drank it.
500	00:40:46	00:40:48	Liquid nicotine.
501	00:40:48	00:40:56	Truman Capote used it as a murder weapon in his story, Hand-Carved Coffins, and our killer put it in Aunt Penny's liqueur bottle.
502	00:41:02	00:41:06	A cigarette introduces approximately one milligram of nicotine into the body.
503	00:41:06	00:41:10	The liqueur contained  over 60.
504	00:41:10	00:41:15	A dose that massive can induce severe convulsions...
505	00:41:18	00:41:22	...and evidently, mess up a meticulously crafted murder.
506	00:41:22	00:41:24	That's why the miniature wasn't at the crime scene.
507	00:41:24	00:41:29	The killer was compelled to fix it, so that it would match what actually happened.
508	00:41:34	00:41:39	Liquid nicotine is in a lot of smoking cessation products.
509	00:41:39	00:41:43	Yeah. Commonly available to just about anyone.
510	00:41:43	00:41:45	Any luck with the vic's calls?
511	00:41:45	00:41:50	Kind of. I data-mined the home phone numbers of Izzy Delancy and Penny Garden.
512	00:41:50	00:41:52	They actually had ten numbers in common.
513	00:41:52	00:41:57	Information, couple of mail-order catalogs, power company, Moviefone.
514	00:41:57	00:42:04	There's one other number which turned out to be an untraceable disposable cell phone-- suggests someone who doesn't want to be found.
515	00:42:04	00:42:08	Hey, boss, unless you need me for something, I'm gonna take off.
516	00:42:08	00:42:11	Yeah. Take off that suit, too.
517	00:42:12	00:42:14	And Greg...
518	00:42:14	00:42:15	you did a good job.
519	00:42:16	00:42:19	I'm glad you think so.
520	00:42:44	00:42:46	You've been served.
521	00:43:01	00:43:03	What is it, Archie?
522	00:43:03	00:43:04	Oh, hey, Gris.
523	00:43:04	00:43:09	I was just looking at footage from the next-door neighbor's, the night the package was delivered.
524	00:43:11	00:43:13	Never underestimate the Neighborhood Watch.
525	00:43:16	00:43:19	I don't see a delivery truck.
526	00:43:19	00:43:23	Well, fortunately for us, this was a personal delivery...
527	00:43:23	00:43:26	right to our front door.
