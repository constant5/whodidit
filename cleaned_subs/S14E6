4,00:00:33,00:00:34,Money plays.
5,00:00:34,00:00:37,$100.
6,00:00:41,00:00:43,Eleven.
7,00:00:46,00:00:48,Doubling down.
8,00:00:48,00:00:50,21. Yes!
9,00:00:56,00:00:57,Two or 12.
10,00:00:59,00:01:00,Splitting aces.
11,00:01:03,00:01:05,21. Oh!
12,00:01:05,00:01:06,21. Yes!
13,00:01:11,00:01:12,Blackjack. Yes!
14,00:01:12,00:01:15,"(cheers, drums on table)"
15,00:01:15,00:01:16,Blackjack.
16,00:01:17,00:01:19,Eyes on BJ-13.
17,00:01:19,00:01:22,"MAN: I'm already on him, Bobby. I don't know what to tell you."
18,00:01:22,00:01:25,I can't figure out how he's doing it.
19,00:01:25,00:01:27,Blackjack. Yeah!
20,00:01:28,00:01:30,"Whoo! $100,000."
21,00:01:34,00:01:34,Twenty-one. Yeah!
22,00:01:36,00:01:37,21. Blackjack.
23,00:01:37,00:01:39,"$200,000."
24,00:01:39,00:01:40,Shuffle.
25,00:01:44,00:01:47,21. Yes!
26,00:01:47,00:01:49,"Okay, I think you're done."
27,00:01:49,00:01:50,Okay.
28,00:01:52,00:01:53,Good luck.
29,00:01:53,00:01:55,Thank you.
30,00:01:55,00:01:57,Thank you.
31,00:02:01,00:02:04,I think I'm done.
32,00:02:05,00:02:07,Cash me out.
33,00:02:07,00:02:10,"That's a hell of a run there, uh, Mr...."
34,00:02:12,00:02:15,"That's about $350,000."
35,00:02:15,00:02:16,Your lucky day.
36,00:02:16,00:02:17,I have a proposition for you.
37,00:02:17,00:02:18,Why don't you stick around?
38,00:02:18,00:02:21,We're gonna put you upstairs in a suite on us.
39,00:02:21,00:02:27,"You can eat up, clean up, and then come back down here in a few hours and take us for everything we got."
40,00:02:27,00:02:28,How does that sound?
41,00:02:28,00:02:32,"No, I'd like to cash out..."
42,00:02:32,00:02:34,now.
43,00:02:41,00:02:42,(indistinct radio transmission)
44,00:02:47,00:02:49,Excuse me.
45,00:02:53,00:02:54,Who are you?
46,00:02:54,00:02:56,Do you know what time it is?
47,00:02:56,00:03:01,"I'm sorry? It's 8:00 a.m., as in the graveyard shift ended two hours ago."
48,00:03:01,00:03:02,"You realize that, right?"
49,00:03:02,00:03:06,"This body is, is mine."
50,00:03:06,00:03:08,I'm not going to get into a turf war with you right now.
51,00:03:08,00:03:11,Because you'll lose.
52,00:03:11,00:03:14,"Look, don't make me call your supervisor."
53,00:03:14,00:03:15,"Oh, too late."
54,00:03:15,00:03:16,And you are...?
55,00:03:16,00:03:20,"Sean Yeager, day shift."
56,00:03:20,00:03:21,"RUSSELL: Oh, Yeager."
57,00:03:21,00:03:23,"Yeah, your supervisor speaks very highly of you."
58,00:03:23,00:03:25,"You're a CSI-2, right?"
59,00:03:25,00:03:28,"Yeah, one solve away from a promotion?"
60,00:03:28,00:03:33,"Yes, sir. You know, I-I never cared much for this day shift versus night shift crap."
61,00:03:33,00:03:36,"I mean, we're all one crime lab, right?"
62,00:03:36,00:03:38,"All for one, one for all."
63,00:03:38,00:03:42,"Okay, look, cards on the table here."
64,00:03:42,00:03:44,I really do need this solve to be a solo.
65,00:03:44,00:03:50,"I hate to break it to you, Yeager, but I don't think this is the game-changer that you're looking for."
66,00:03:50,00:03:53,Homeless guy assaulted in an alley. (phone chirping)
67,00:03:53,00:03:54,Looks like a trash run.
68,00:03:54,00:03:55,Yeah?
69,00:03:55,00:03:57,I'm not so sure about that.
70,00:03:57,00:03:58,"Yeah, I think I'm with you."
71,00:03:58,00:03:59,"Why, do you got something?"
72,00:03:59,00:04:04,"Uh, my wife Barbara is stranded at the airport, needs a lift."
73,00:04:04,00:04:05,So you should go pick her up.
74,00:04:05,00:04:07,We'll take care of this.
75,00:04:07,00:04:09,RUSSELL: The two of you work together?
76,00:04:09,00:04:11,I think that's a great idea.
77,00:04:13,00:04:14,Don't you think?
78,00:04:14,00:04:17,"Like you said, all for one and one for all."
79,00:04:18,00:04:20,(chuckles)
80,00:04:56,00:05:00,"Whew, this guy is ripe, and I don't think it's decomp."
81,00:05:00,00:05:03,I think he just may have really needed a shower.
82,00:05:03,00:05:06,"BRODY: He's got dirty clothes, got weathered skin."
83,00:05:06,00:05:08,"He's been living on the streets for quite a while, you can tell."
84,00:05:08,00:05:10,"You get a wallet, David?"
85,00:05:10,00:05:11,No wallet-- I checked.
86,00:05:11,00:05:14,"PHILLIPS: Yeager, come on, man, you know the protocol."
87,00:05:14,00:05:16,You can't touch my body without my authorization.
88,00:05:16,00:05:18,I didn't touch your body.
89,00:05:18,00:05:20,I saw a wear pattern on the back pocket with no lump.
90,00:05:20,00:05:22,"No lump, no wallet."
91,00:05:22,00:05:27,"I figure the guy gets mugged, the attacker rifles through the wallet and tosses it in the nearest trash receptacle."
92,00:05:27,00:05:28,"Hey, I'm not in here for my health."
93,00:05:28,00:05:29,You've been in there for a while.
94,00:05:29,00:05:31,You found a wallet yet?
95,00:05:31,00:05:32,I'm working on it.
96,00:05:32,00:05:38,"PHILLIPS: Hey, uh, liver temp was 91.1, which puts time of death at around 3:00 this morning."
97,00:05:38,00:05:43,I count 12 sharp-force injuries with a two-inch blade.
98,00:05:43,00:05:44,Stabbed in the back.
99,00:05:44,00:05:45,I know how he feels.
100,00:05:45,00:05:47,You know what?
101,00:05:47,00:05:48,"When we close this case, you can have the solve."
102,00:05:48,00:05:52,"Thanks, but I don't need your charity."
103,00:05:52,00:05:54,Case...
104,00:05:54,00:05:56,in point.
105,00:05:56,00:05:58,Blood says it's related.
106,00:05:59,00:06:01,Empty.
107,00:06:01,00:06:05,What is homeless guy doing with the Mission: Impossible briefcase?
108,00:06:06,00:06:08,So much for your trash run.
109,00:06:15,00:06:17,Got blood drops.
110,00:06:17,00:06:20,Looks like the assault started right here.
111,00:06:20,00:06:23,"Our victim is heading down the alley, he gets attacked from behind."
112,00:06:23,00:06:26,"The assailant grabs the briefcase, steals what's inside."
113,00:06:29,00:06:33,But these blood smears and drag marks say that it didn't end there.
114,00:06:33,00:06:41,"The killer sees his victim still alive, trying to crawl away, so he drags him out of sight, finishes him off."
115,00:06:41,00:06:46,"You know, you see that blood on his finger and under his hand?"
116,00:06:46,00:06:48,"Weird, right?"
117,00:06:48,00:06:49,D.E.
118,00:06:49,00:06:52,What do you suppose that means?
119,00:06:52,00:06:56,"Well, maybe it's a, a message, you know, last words to a loved one."
120,00:06:56,00:07:03,"Or, if it were me, my dying breath, I'd try to identify my killer."
121,00:07:03,00:07:05,I see you're not the sentimental type.
122,00:07:05,00:07:07,"Okay, I like that."
123,00:07:09,00:07:10,"RUSSELL: Oh, boy, honey, I'm so sorry."
124,00:07:10,00:07:13,Problem solved.
125,00:07:13,00:07:15,Conrad wanted me to reschedule a hearing.
126,00:07:15,00:07:18,"It's okay, I get it, I know you're a very busy person."
127,00:07:18,00:07:21,That's why I said I would take a taxi from the airport.
128,00:07:21,00:07:22,"No, no, I told you I wanted to take you home."
129,00:07:22,00:07:24,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna take you home."
130,00:07:24,00:07:26,Sit first. Have something to eat.
131,00:07:26,00:07:28,These pastries are good. Pastry?
132,00:07:28,00:07:32,"No, I-- ah, I'm sorry, I can't-- couldn't possibly..."
133,00:07:32,00:07:34,"I will-- let me have a hit of that coffee, though."
134,00:07:34,00:07:35,Thanks.
135,00:07:37,00:07:38,Hey.
136,00:07:38,00:07:41,"I'm sorry, really, I..."
137,00:07:41,00:07:42,How are you?
138,00:07:42,00:07:44,How was Seattle?
139,00:07:44,00:07:49,"Maya and Katie are both doing very well, and Ryan talked with his company and worked it out so he can stay home more."
140,00:07:49,00:07:51,That's good.
141,00:07:51,00:07:53,(phone beeps)
142,00:07:53,00:07:55,Have you talked to Charlie?
143,00:07:55,00:07:56,It's been crazy around here.
144,00:07:56,00:07:59,I-I know I got a couple of messages from him.
145,00:07:59,00:08:03,"Is there something I should know? Well, there's something he would like to tell you himself."
146,00:08:03,00:08:05,"Oh, come on, come on, that's not fair."
147,00:08:05,00:08:06,I promise I'll act surprised.
148,00:08:06,00:08:07,What? What?
149,00:08:07,00:08:13,"He's gotten an offer from Eastern Indiana-- full scholarship, starting point guard."
150,00:08:13,00:08:15,Is he gonna take it?
151,00:08:15,00:08:17,"Well, I think so."
152,00:08:17,00:08:22,"Well, that is news."
153,00:08:22,00:08:24,"It's great, it-it's just that, you know..."
154,00:08:24,00:08:32,"one of the reasons why we took this job was so we could be, you know, near Charlie, watch him play his games."
155,00:08:32,00:08:35,I think getting away could be good for him.
156,00:08:35,00:08:36,I know.
157,00:08:36,00:08:39,I know.
158,00:08:39,00:08:41,"I just didn't expect it, that's all."
159,00:08:41,00:08:44,"Things change, plans change."
160,00:08:46,00:08:49,That sounds like another discussion we need to have.
161,00:08:49,00:08:51,"Yeah, but at another time."
162,00:08:51,00:08:55,"I can tell you're busy, sweetheart, and I can take a taxi."
163,00:09:02,00:09:03,"Hey, Doc, got your message."
164,00:09:03,00:09:05,You have something for me?
165,00:09:05,00:09:10,"Yeah, still working on our alley John Doe, but I found this in one of the wound tracks."
166,00:09:10,00:09:12,Maybe a piece of the murder weapon.
167,00:09:12,00:09:15,Tip of the blade-- maybe it broke off.
168,00:09:15,00:09:16,I'll get it to Hodges.
169,00:09:16,00:09:19,Tell me something-- these wound patterns...
170,00:09:19,00:09:24,"I admit sometimes cases start to blur together, but I could swear I have seen this somewhere before."
171,00:09:24,00:09:29,"Well, the two wounds in the center, closest to the spine, appear deeper and wider."
172,00:09:29,00:09:31,Almost like the killer twisted the blade.
173,00:09:31,00:09:35,"Yeah, but the rest of the wounds are clean, sharp."
174,00:09:35,00:09:37,"That could be overkill, rage."
175,00:09:37,00:09:40,Or something else-- a signature.
176,00:09:40,00:09:42,"I'll pull some case files, see what I can find."
177,00:09:42,00:09:44,Thanks.
178,00:10:30,00:10:32,(bell chimes)
179,00:10:36,00:10:39,"WOMAN: Well, don't you look like a lovely couple."
180,00:10:39,00:10:40,Let me guess.
181,00:10:40,00:10:42,You're in the market for a ring?
182,00:10:42,00:10:49,"(chuckles) Uh, information, actually. I am CSI Brody, and this is CSI Yeager."
183,00:10:49,00:10:51,"I take it you're Ruby. Yes, but..."
184,00:10:51,00:10:55,"if this is police business, I must confess, I'm just the name on the door."
185,00:10:55,00:10:57,My boys run the store now.
186,00:10:57,00:10:59,I just come in occasionally to help out.
187,00:10:59,00:11:01,Keeps me out of trouble.
188,00:11:01,00:11:03,Kyle!
189,00:11:03,00:11:04,Zeke!
190,00:11:04,00:11:05,Little help up front.
191,00:11:05,00:11:07,"KYLE: Coming, Ma. What's up?"
192,00:11:07,00:11:11,"Well, these very nice, uh, police folks would like to talk to you about something."
193,00:11:11,00:11:13,I'll be in the back if you need me.
194,00:11:13,00:11:17,"Oh, and, honey, don't let him get away."
195,00:11:19,00:11:21,"Uh, okay. Um..."
196,00:11:21,00:11:24,we recovered this pawn ticket.
197,00:11:24,00:11:26,Looks like it's from one of your customers last night.
198,00:11:26,00:11:27,We just need a name.
199,00:11:29,00:11:30,"Hey, what's this about?"
200,00:11:30,00:11:32,"Well, that wasn't the question."
201,00:11:32,00:11:34,This is time-stamped 11:49.
202,00:11:34,00:11:36,Why don't you look that up?
203,00:11:36,00:11:40,"Uh, our computers are down right now, so... Mmm."
204,00:11:40,00:11:41,"Uh, 11:49?"
205,00:11:41,00:11:45,"Plaid shirt, T-shirt, jeans, smelled bad."
206,00:11:45,00:11:52,"Farami watch. 14 karat pinky ring with the inscription worn off at 90 days at 23%. $200, uh, cash on the barrel."
207,00:11:52,00:11:53,Wow.
208,00:11:53,00:11:54,You remembered all that?
209,00:11:56,00:11:58,Can you remember his name?
210,00:11:58,00:12:00,Jeremy Sikes.
211,00:12:00,00:12:03,"1139 Cornell Road, St. George, Utah, 84780."
212,00:12:03,00:12:05,"I made a copy of his driver's license, too."
213,00:12:05,00:12:08,200 bucks for a Farami watch and a gold ring?
214,00:12:08,00:12:12,"I can see you're, uh, real generous. It's a secured loan."
215,00:12:12,00:12:14,"Guy doesn't come back for it, that's on him."
216,00:12:14,00:12:16,You sure it's just on him?
217,00:12:16,00:12:17,Here you go.
218,00:12:17,00:12:19,Thank you.
219,00:12:19,00:12:21,You mind if I hold on to this?
220,00:12:21,00:12:23,"Uh, yeah, sure. I always make a duplicate."
221,00:12:23,00:12:25,"You never know. Oh, and the watch and the ring."
222,00:12:25,00:12:28,"You guys still have those, right?"
223,00:12:28,00:12:30,Yeah. We got 'em.
224,00:12:30,00:12:32,Great. We'll take those to go.
225,00:12:34,00:12:36,"RUSSELL: Wow, somebody had a good night."
226,00:12:36,00:12:42,"FINLAY Yep, that's Jeremy Sikes from last night from the eye-in-the-sky from Pike's Gambling Hall."
227,00:12:42,00:12:49,This was distributed to security at all the casinos in town with a warning to keep a lookout for this guy. RUSSELL: Why?
228,00:12:49,00:12:50,Was he causing trouble?
229,00:12:50,00:12:51,"Oh, the worst kind."
230,00:12:51,00:12:52,At least in Vegas.
231,00:12:52,00:13:01,"Our friend here took his $200 from Ruby's Pawn Shop, walked into Pike's and 37 hands, 45 minutes later, he had $350,000."
232,00:13:01,00:13:03,Wow.
233,00:13:03,00:13:06,"Well, at least we know why he had that briefcase."
234,00:13:06,00:13:11,"$200 turning into 350 grand-- come on, what are the odds of that?"
235,00:13:11,00:13:15,I'd say somewhere in the range of being eaten by a shark while being struck by lightning.
236,00:13:15,00:13:18,"(chuckles): Yeah... The casino, obviously, thought that he was cheating."
237,00:13:18,00:13:19,Card counting?
238,00:13:19,00:13:21,"No, the betting pattern was off."
239,00:13:21,00:13:27,"They suspected collusion with his dealer, Kristi Holt, who, by the way, did not show up for work this morning."
240,00:13:27,00:13:31,RUSSELL: You're thinking that Sikes and Holt were scamming the casino.
241,00:13:31,00:13:34,And then Holt stabbed Sikes in the back-- literally-- and ran off with the money.
242,00:13:34,00:13:36,"Interesting theory, but..."
243,00:13:36,00:13:38,(tapping keys)
244,00:13:38,00:13:43,"RUSSELL: Look at that-- Sikes drew quite the crowd. Any one of them could've followed him back into the alley, right?"
245,00:13:43,00:13:44,FINLAY: My money's still on the dealer.
246,00:13:44,00:13:46,That's because you're assuming that they were cheating.
247,00:13:46,00:13:47,Of course they cheated.
248,00:13:47,00:13:54,"No, and Sikes even tried to I.D. his killer in his own blood: ""D-E"" spells ""Dealer"" to me."
249,00:13:54,00:14:02,"Look, for all we know, this is just one of those great Vegas stories: Guy pawns his last possessions, nets it all and wins."
250,00:14:02,00:14:06,The two of them are total strangers and it's just a case of dumb luck.
251,00:14:06,00:14:07,I don't believe in luck.
252,00:14:07,00:14:08,"Me, neither."
253,00:14:08,00:14:11,Why? What do you got?
254,00:14:11,00:14:15,A connection... between Jeremy Sikes and our dealer Kristi Holt.
255,00:14:15,00:14:21,The watch that Sikes pawned for stake money turned out to belong to Kristi's husband.
256,00:14:21,00:14:24,And here's the kicker: Her husband was murdered two months ago.
257,00:14:26,00:14:29,"Dumb luck, huh?"
258,00:14:29,00:14:36,I'm thinking that maybe this casino heist isn't the first time that Kristi enlisted Sikes to engage in a little dirty work.
259,00:14:36,00:14:40,"Two months ago, she has him murder her husband."
260,00:14:40,00:14:45,"And, last night, after they both scammed the casino, Kristi kills Sikes."
261,00:14:45,00:14:51,"So it looks like we have this Kristi Holt dealing the death card-- not just once, but twice."
262,00:14:56,00:15:02,"Yeager and I pulled the cold case file on the murder of Simon Holt, our blackjack dealer's husband."
263,00:15:02,00:15:04,You and Yeager.
264,00:15:04,00:15:06,Nice to see you kids getting along.
265,00:15:06,00:15:08,"Yeah, well, let's just be clear: I'm Rizzoli and she's Isles."
266,00:15:08,00:15:10,(laughing): Yeah.
267,00:15:10,00:15:13,"Anyway, the case is still open."
268,00:15:13,00:15:16,And maybe open because day shift was investigating.
269,00:15:16,00:15:18,"Don't look at me, okay? I was on the swing shift then."
270,00:15:18,00:15:20,"The night of the murder, Kristi Holt was questioned."
271,00:15:20,00:15:26,She said she finished up her shift at Pike's then left the casino to meet up with her husband Simon.
272,00:15:26,00:15:28,"They met for dinner, then got home around midnight."
273,00:15:28,00:15:30,She was really tired.
274,00:15:30,00:15:33,"Immediately went upstairs to bed, and he went to the living room to watch the news."
275,00:15:33,00:15:35,YEAGER: And that's when she heard two shots ring out.
276,00:15:35,00:15:38,She ran downstairs and found her husband dead and the place was ransacked.
277,00:15:38,00:15:43,So Kristi Holt's story is that her husband walked in on some guy robbing the place.
278,00:15:43,00:15:45,"Now, in defense of day shift, it was a good story."
279,00:15:45,00:15:47,There was no reason to doubt it.
280,00:15:47,00:15:48,Until last night...
281,00:15:48,00:15:50,when Jeremy Sikes turned up dead.
282,00:15:50,00:15:57,"After pawning Kristi Holt's husband's watch, and going on one hell of a run at her blackjack table."
283,00:15:57,00:16:00,They say there are no coincidences.
284,00:16:00,00:16:03,"Yeah, but... sometimes there are."
285,00:16:03,00:16:04,Yeah. Right.
286,00:16:04,00:16:06,Dumb luck.
287,00:16:06,00:16:10,I thought we agreed that luck wasn't a player in this.
288,00:16:10,00:16:11,"All right, well, then, call it destiny."
289,00:16:11,00:16:16,Or fate. BRODY: Of all of the blackjack tables in all of the world-- is that where you're going with this?
290,00:16:16,00:16:20,"No, where I'm going with this is there's one person still alive who can answer these questions."
291,00:16:20,00:16:22,(phone chimes) BRODY: Mm.
292,00:16:22,00:16:23,"What, is that your wife again?"
293,00:16:23,00:16:25,"No, someone else's."
294,00:16:25,00:16:28,"A widow, as a matter of fact."
295,00:16:28,00:16:30,Brass just picked up Kristi Holt.
296,00:16:30,00:16:37,"If this is about what happened last night, I'll tell you what I told Bobby, my pit boss: It was a straight-up run."
297,00:16:37,00:16:39,There was no cheat.
298,00:16:39,00:16:43,"If we're just talking about cheating here, then this is your lucky night."
299,00:16:43,00:16:44,Now it's my turn to deal.
300,00:16:48,00:16:49,Your pal Jeremy Sikes.
301,00:16:49,00:16:51,"Oh, my God, wha... that's... the guy."
302,00:16:51,00:16:53,I... Is he...?
303,00:16:53,00:16:54,Dead? Yeah.
304,00:16:54,00:16:56,But I think you know that.
305,00:16:57,00:16:58,How about I hit you again?
306,00:16:58,00:17:01,Your husband Simon.
307,00:17:01,00:17:05,"This is the time in this gambling session, when you go bust."
308,00:17:05,00:17:08,Or you play your ace in the hole and tell me the truth.
309,00:17:08,00:17:10,The truth?
310,00:17:10,00:17:13,The truth is my husband was murdered when he walked in on a burglary.
311,00:17:13,00:17:15,You sure you want to stick with that story?
312,00:17:15,00:17:16,It's not a story.
313,00:17:16,00:17:28,"Yes, it is. And you really ought to hang out with a better class of co-conspirator-- or at least a smarter one-- because your pal Jeremy pawned your husband's watch for $200 and brought the money to the table-- that's what staked him in the game."
314,00:17:28,00:17:30,This guy... had Simon's watch?
315,00:17:30,00:17:32,Yes.
316,00:17:32,00:17:39,"If he had his watch, it must be because he stole it because he's the one who broke in our house."
317,00:17:39,00:17:44,Or there could be another explanation: You could've given it to him as a little thank-you gift for killing your husband.
318,00:17:44,00:17:46,That's sick!
319,00:17:46,00:17:47,I gave that watch to Simon for our anniversary!
320,00:17:47,00:17:49,Yeah. We checked with Farami.
321,00:17:49,00:17:51,It's a special order.
322,00:17:51,00:17:52,"Around $2,000."
323,00:17:52,00:18:02,"So I--I looked at the insurance records, the claims and the police statements, and... nowhere is there mention of a $2,000 watch."
324,00:18:02,00:18:04,"My husband was murdered, Detective."
325,00:18:04,00:18:06,I forgot about the damn watch!
326,00:18:06,00:18:07,You didn't forget about the insurance money.
327,00:18:07,00:18:09,Which went to pay off Simon's debts!
328,00:18:09,00:18:14,"Which is why you and Jeremy doubled down at Pike's Gambling Hall, to the tune of $350,000."
329,00:18:14,00:18:17,"Kristi, you know, you didn't show up for work."
330,00:18:17,00:18:19,"You end up at a motel, hiding under the bed..."
331,00:18:19,00:18:21,this doesn't look good.
332,00:18:21,00:18:26,"If you worked for old-school guys at an old-school casino like Pike's, and they thought you cheated them..."
333,00:18:26,00:18:28,"you'd be laying low in a motel, too."
334,00:18:28,00:18:36,"And if this is the guy who broke in my house and killed my husband, then he deserved to die."
335,00:18:36,00:18:46,"But I didn't kill him, and I didn't have anything to do with cheating the casino last night, and if you don't believe me, check the damn tape, the cards, the shuffler-- I didn't cheat!"
336,00:19:01,00:19:02,(cards fluttering)
337,00:19:12,00:19:14,(computer blipping)
338,00:19:30,00:19:31,"(tapping on glass) ANDREWS: Hey, hey."
339,00:19:31,00:19:33,What do you got?
340,00:19:33,00:19:35,It looks like our dealer didn't cheat.
341,00:19:35,00:19:36,Says you.
342,00:19:36,00:19:37,I'm still not convinced.
343,00:19:37,00:19:39,This guy went on an insane run.
344,00:19:39,00:19:43,"We saw the tape. He's hitting when he shouldn't, holding when he shouldn't-- the odds of that happening are..."
345,00:19:43,00:19:46,"183,120 to one."
346,00:19:47,00:19:48,I have an app.
347,00:19:48,00:19:50,Okay.
348,00:19:50,00:19:52,What about the evidence?
349,00:19:52,00:19:54,I did examine all 416 cards in play-- they weren't marked.
350,00:19:54,00:19:56,And the shoe checked out.
351,00:19:56,00:19:57,And I looked at the shuffler.
352,00:19:57,00:20:00,There's no sign that either one of them was tampered with.
353,00:20:00,00:20:02,And you didn't get anything on the eye in the sky?
354,00:20:02,00:20:06,"No. If she was palming cards or pulling some sleight of hand, she was doing it between the video frames."
355,00:20:06,00:20:08,"Okay, so she's a magician."
356,00:20:08,00:20:10,That doesn't mean she's not a killer.
357,00:20:10,00:20:12,I like what she said. (scoffs)
358,00:20:12,00:20:15,Looks like you're the only one.
359,00:20:15,00:20:20,FINLAY: So we weren't the first to toss Kristi Holt into the box.
360,00:20:20,00:20:28,"She was detained by casino security right after she left the blackjack table, and then was interrogated by her pit boss Bobby Esposito."
361,00:20:28,00:20:30,That's them in the holding room.
362,00:20:30,00:20:31,Check out the time code.
363,00:20:31,00:20:33,BRODY: 2:58 a.m.
364,00:20:33,00:20:35,Sikes' time of death was 3:00.
365,00:20:35,00:20:38,So Holt's inquisition lasted over four hours.
366,00:20:38,00:20:40,There is no way that she killed Sikes.
367,00:20:40,00:20:42,So who did?
368,00:20:42,00:20:45,"Well, I hate to admit it, but Russell may be right."
369,00:20:45,00:20:48,Sikes' run at the table did draw a crowd.
370,00:20:48,00:20:51,Meaning there are several people who could've followed him out that night.
371,00:20:51,00:20:54,Did you get a chance to look through the rest of the casino's floor footage?
372,00:20:54,00:20:58,Did you see anybody that looked like they were shadowing him at all?
373,00:20:58,00:21:01,"Well, I didn't see anybody who was obviously following him."
374,00:21:01,00:21:02,Wait a minute.
375,00:21:02,00:21:03,Freeze it for a second?
376,00:21:03,00:21:04,FINLAY: What do you see?
377,00:21:04,00:21:06,BRODY: Take it back just a little bit.
378,00:21:06,00:21:07,Right there.
379,00:21:07,00:21:09,"That guy, talking to the pit boss."
380,00:21:09,00:21:11,I've seen him before.
381,00:21:11,00:21:13,You've seen him before? Where?
382,00:21:13,00:21:15,BRODY: On someone else's security video.
383,00:21:15,00:21:18,(doorbell chimes)
384,00:21:18,00:21:20,Where's your friend? Busy.
385,00:21:20,00:21:21,Just get me this time.
386,00:21:21,00:21:25,"You know, cops keep showing up around here, people are gonna get the wrong idea about my establishment."
387,00:21:25,00:21:28,You gonna return that watch and ring you took or...?
388,00:21:28,00:21:29,"No, they're still in evidence."
389,00:21:29,00:21:31,"Actually, I am here to look at a few other items."
390,00:21:31,00:21:33,You gotta be kidding me.
391,00:21:33,00:21:39,Nope. The surveillance video that you gave us shows this guy coming into your establishment sometime after 3:00 a.m.
392,00:21:39,00:21:40,He works for Pike's Gambling Hall.
393,00:21:40,00:21:42,His name's Alonzo Pierce.
394,00:21:42,00:21:48,"Pierce: uh, 1453-- 1456 uh, Silver Ridge Road, Seven Hills, 89052."
395,00:21:48,00:21:50,"I got his phone number, if you need it."
396,00:21:50,00:21:52,Thanks.
397,00:21:52,00:21:54,"Actually, what I need is to look at the items that he pawned."
398,00:21:54,00:21:56,Looked like an old turntable and some speakers.
399,00:21:56,00:21:59,"Right, and I would love to help you out with that, it's just..."
400,00:21:59,00:22:01,"it's such a mess back there right now, it's kind of..."
401,00:22:01,00:22:02,I know where it is.
402,00:22:02,00:22:03,(chuckles)
403,00:22:03,00:22:05,"Of course you do, little bro."
404,00:22:05,00:22:08,"Yeah, Rain Man here will take care of you."
405,00:22:16,00:22:18,Oh.
406,00:22:19,00:22:23,"Okay, uh, turntable, not valuable."
407,00:22:23,00:22:25,Uh...
408,00:22:25,00:22:27,"The speakers, they're Cadillacs."
409,00:22:27,00:22:31,"Frequency response 30 kilohertz, impedance four ohms..."
410,00:22:31,00:22:33,"You tried them out, and they didn't work, right?"
411,00:22:33,00:22:34,"Yeah, the-the left one's out."
412,00:22:34,00:22:35,How'd you know that?
413,00:22:35,00:22:40,"Do you mind, uh, letting me borrow that little drill over there?"
414,00:22:40,00:22:41,Sure.
415,00:22:41,00:22:43,Thanks.
416,00:22:43,00:22:46,"(drill whirring) Uh, I'm pretty good with electronics."
417,00:22:46,00:22:48,I'm sure you are.
418,00:22:48,00:22:51,"These speakers, it's usually just a, like, a wiring issue."
419,00:22:51,00:22:54,"Well, in this case, I think it might be something just a little bit different."
420,00:22:54,00:22:55,(gasps)
421,00:22:57,00:23:00,"Whoa. Uh, okay, that's a lot of money."
422,00:23:00,00:23:03,"I'm guessing about $350,000."
423,00:23:03,00:23:04,I don't understand that.
424,00:23:04,00:23:06,"If I had that kind of money, I'd put it in, like, a bank."
425,00:23:06,00:23:07,Unless you couldn't.
426,00:23:07,00:23:12,"Place like this, people drop off an item, you keep it for 60 days, then they come back to collect."
427,00:23:12,00:23:16,Beats a bank if you're trying to beat a murder charge.
428,00:23:18,00:23:22,Pike's casino said Alonzo Pierce didn't show up for his shift today.
429,00:23:22,00:23:24,Getting to be a habit with their workforce.
430,00:23:24,00:23:26,"Yeah, a real brain drain at Pike's."
431,00:23:26,00:23:28,"We buzzed Alonzo's apartment, no answer."
432,00:23:28,00:23:30,His manager said he was going on a trip; he took a small bag.
433,00:23:30,00:23:32,When was this? A few minutes ago.
434,00:23:32,00:23:34,We got the exits covered; he's not going anywhere.
435,00:23:34,00:23:36,(whispering): That's him.
436,00:23:37,00:23:40,(gun clicking)
437,00:23:41,00:23:43,BRASS: Alonzo Pierce!
438,00:23:43,00:23:45,Las Vegas Police. You're under arrest.
439,00:23:45,00:23:46,Hey!
440,00:23:46,00:23:49,"Sorry, pal, but you're gonna be disappointed."
441,00:23:51,00:23:52,It's the pit boss.
442,00:23:52,00:23:54,Told you.
443,00:23:54,00:23:56,What the hell are you doing here?
444,00:23:56,00:23:59,Use your freaking imagination.
445,00:23:59,00:24:02,Get him out of here.
446,00:24:02,00:24:04,Pop the trunk.
447,00:24:08,00:24:10,Oh.
448,00:24:10,00:24:12,Alonzo Pierce.
449,00:24:12,00:24:14,That was a short trip.
450,00:24:14,00:24:17,"Yeah, well, nobody steals from Pike's Gambling Hall."
451,00:24:17,00:24:20,"Well, at least somebody at Pike's is dedicated to their job."
452,00:24:25,00:24:28,"Tell you something, Bobby, you make detective work look simple."
453,00:24:28,00:24:32,"I mean, there you are, standing there, gun in your hand, Alonzo's Pierce's body in the trunk."
454,00:24:32,00:24:34,"I mean, all I had to do was call a tow truck."
455,00:24:34,00:24:36,I'm gonna make it even easier for you.
456,00:24:36,00:24:40,"I'm gonna tell you exactly what that little bitch, Alonzo, did."
457,00:24:40,00:24:42,Tell me.
458,00:24:42,00:24:45,You know I seen a lot of cheats in my time.
459,00:24:45,00:24:48,"But last night, (sighs) that was different."
460,00:24:48,00:24:55,"I don't know exactly what this guy and my dealer had going on, but I knew the grift was on."
461,00:24:55,00:24:57,"It had to be, 'cause nobody's that lucky."
462,00:24:57,00:25:06,"See, in the old days, Vegas, when guys like Sam Braun used to run the town, we would've put this guy in a car, done a little carpentry on him."
463,00:25:06,00:25:08,He would've given it up.
464,00:25:08,00:25:10,Town's changed.
465,00:25:10,00:25:12,Not for the better.
466,00:25:12,00:25:13,"Right, more civilized now."
467,00:25:13,00:25:15,You whack guys in the alley.
468,00:25:15,00:25:17,I didn't tell him to whack the guy.
469,00:25:17,00:25:25,I just told him to get the cash back and put a little healthy fear of God in him before he put him on the Trailways bus.
470,00:25:25,00:25:28,So Alonzo killed Sikes on his own initiative?
471,00:25:28,00:25:29,And he stole the cash.
472,00:25:29,00:25:31,Believe that?
473,00:25:31,00:25:34,"I don't know what to believe anymore, Bobby."
474,00:25:34,00:25:44,"I mentored him, and he turns around, this little bitch, and he doesn't have the cojones to look me in the eye and tell me the truth?"
475,00:25:44,00:25:49,He has to make up some BS story about he didn't kill him.
476,00:25:49,00:25:54,"He just roughed him up, and he put the cash away for safekeeping."
477,00:25:54,00:26:02,"I'm not gonna lie to you, I-I would've whacked him anyway, Alonzo, but that's because he stole from the house."
478,00:26:04,00:26:06,That's a matter of honor.
479,00:26:06,00:26:09,Old Vegas.
480,00:26:09,00:26:11,Damn straight.
481,00:26:14,00:26:21,"See, you and me, we're on opposite sides of the table, but I know that right here, we're on the same page."
482,00:26:25,00:26:27,I'm gonna ask you a favor.
483,00:26:27,00:26:28,What's that?
484,00:26:28,00:26:31,Put in a good word for me at sentencing.
485,00:26:31,00:26:34,I'd like to get sent up to Carson City...
486,00:26:34,00:26:36,with the old boys.
487,00:26:38,00:26:41,Men of honor.
488,00:26:41,00:26:43,Done.
489,00:26:48,00:26:51,Heard you caught a case with day shift.
490,00:26:51,00:26:53,"(chuckles) Yeah, lucky me."
491,00:26:53,00:26:55,Seems to be case closed.
492,00:26:55,00:26:56,Right.
493,00:26:56,00:26:58,"Homicide, guy's luck ran out in the alley."
494,00:26:58,00:27:02,"Yeah, the casino pit boss sent one of his goons after the guy."
495,00:27:02,00:27:08,"The goon kills him, takes the money, and then he stashes it in a stereo speaker and then pawns it."
496,00:27:08,00:27:10,"Now, why am I doing this?"
497,00:27:10,00:27:15,"This day shift guy, Yeager, really wants this solve, he should be the one finishing up the paperwork."
498,00:27:15,00:27:17,"Your victim was stabbed multiple times, wasn't he?"
499,00:27:17,00:27:19,"Yeah, why?"
500,00:27:19,00:27:23,"I don't know, I'm just looking at the timestamps on these photos."
501,00:27:23,00:27:29,"So, the security goon gets his orders from the pit boss at 2:48 a.m.?"
502,00:27:29,00:27:33,"Yeah, and then the goon follows him to the alley and kills him around 3:00."
503,00:27:33,00:27:35,What are you seeing?
504,00:27:35,00:27:37,"You know, what about the clothes?"
505,00:27:37,00:27:41,"Doesn't this look like the same suit, same shirt, same tie?"
506,00:27:41,00:27:43,"Oh, my God, you're right."
507,00:27:43,00:27:47,"Guy stabs him 12 times, and he doesn't have a single drop of blood on his clothes."
508,00:27:47,00:27:51,Yeager still hasn't gotten his solve.
509,00:27:51,00:27:54,"SANDERS: Hey, Morgan, I've been looking for you."
510,00:27:54,00:27:57,So your security guard didn't kill Sikes.
511,00:27:57,00:27:58,"Yeah, I know."
512,00:27:58,00:28:00,"What, Hodges told you about the bullet?"
513,00:28:00,00:28:02,What bullet?
514,00:28:02,00:28:04,The metal fragment we found in Sikes' wound track.
515,00:28:04,00:28:07,"We thought it was the tip of the knife, but it turns out it's from a bullet."
516,00:28:07,00:28:08,I thought he was stabbed.
517,00:28:08,00:28:10,Now you're saying he was shot?
518,00:28:10,00:28:11,"Yeah, twice."
519,00:28:11,00:28:13,(two gunshots)
520,00:28:13,00:28:19,"And then the killer used the knife to dig out the bullets, and then proceeded to stab him ten more times."
521,00:28:19,00:28:20,To throw us off track.
522,00:28:20,00:28:22,"Well, that's where he made his mistake."
523,00:28:22,00:28:27,"Doc thought he recognized the wound pattern, so I did some checking, found an open case from two years ago, same pattern."
524,00:28:27,00:28:29,Drug informant was murdered.
525,00:28:29,00:28:31,Person of interest was a Luis Delgado.
526,00:28:31,00:28:33,Had ties to the Mala Noche drug cartel in Miami.
527,00:28:33,00:28:35,The letters in blood.
528,00:28:35,00:28:39,"""D.E."" He was trying to spell ""Delgado."" I-I just... I don't get it."
529,00:28:39,00:28:44,Why is a big-time gangster wasting time with a nobody like Jeremy Sikes?
530,00:28:44,00:28:45,I have an idea about that.
531,00:28:45,00:28:50,"Turns out, a month ago, Delgado walked in on a robbery at his house."
532,00:28:50,00:28:52,"He got shot, and his girlfriend called it in."
533,00:28:52,00:28:53,You think Sikes was the robber.
534,00:28:53,00:28:58,"I do, and the DEA has had Delgado under surveillance."
535,00:28:58,00:28:59,Check out this photo.
536,00:28:59,00:29:02,He's wearing the same ring that Sikes pawned at Ruby's.
537,00:29:02,00:29:03,Where is Delgado now?
538,00:29:03,00:29:06,Owns a strip club off of Flamingo.
539,00:29:25,00:29:27,Luis Delgado?
540,00:29:29,00:29:33,I hope these gentlemen are up to date with their carry permits.
541,00:29:33,00:29:34,"What do you want, Detective?"
542,00:29:34,00:29:36,I'm the bearer of good news.
543,00:29:36,00:29:38,You recognize him?
544,00:29:38,00:29:40,His name is Jeremy Sikes.
545,00:29:40,00:29:41,No. Should I?
546,00:29:41,00:29:43,The guy died two nights ago.
547,00:29:43,00:29:45,"Two shots in the back, bullets dug out."
548,00:29:45,00:29:48,Sound familiar? This is the guy who robbed your house.
549,00:29:48,00:29:50,I didn't file any police report.
550,00:29:50,00:29:54,"Yeah, well, we recovered this item, pawned by Sikes."
551,00:29:54,00:29:57,That's my ring.
552,00:29:57,00:30:00,"Yeah, well, no police report, I can't return it to you."
553,00:30:00,00:30:02,Even in prison.
554,00:30:02,00:30:04,"I think you have me mistaken for somebody else, Detective."
555,00:30:04,00:30:08,You say he was killed two nights ago?
556,00:30:08,00:30:10,"You see, my mother, she's very sick."
557,00:30:10,00:30:12,"Two nights ago, I was staying with her."
558,00:30:12,00:30:14,I can prove it.
559,00:30:14,00:30:17,"I mean, you can prove it."
560,00:30:17,00:30:20,So the jury's in; Luis Delgado is a beautiful son.
561,00:30:20,00:30:23,DEA surveillance just alibied him out.
562,00:30:23,00:30:27,"Okay, but that doesn't mean that he didn't get one of his own guys to do it for him."
563,00:30:27,00:30:30,"That's true, but the rep on Delgado is that he's very hands-on."
564,00:30:30,00:30:32,So where does this leave us?
565,00:30:32,00:30:35,"I think we have the right motive, but the wrong person."
566,00:30:35,00:30:42,"So, Kristi Holt and Luis Delgado both talked about Sikes breaking into their houses, and in both cases, they walked in on him."
567,00:30:42,00:30:44,What if they weren't the only ones?
568,00:30:44,00:30:55,"Maybe another homeowner walks in on Sikes, gets a good look at him when he's in their house, two nights ago sees him again in the alley, after he was rolled by Alonzo Pierce."
569,00:30:55,00:30:56,I think we have to pull more case files.
570,00:30:56,00:30:58,"Yeah, I agree."
571,00:30:58,00:30:59,Go back to the pawnshop.
572,00:30:59,00:31:02,See what else Jeremy Sikes pawned for cash.
573,00:31:34,00:31:37,"Okay, what do we got?"
574,00:31:37,00:31:48,"22 items from Ruby's Pawn Shop, all pawned by Jeremy Sikes in the last six months. And all of them can be traced forensically back to five B-and-Es, including the break-ins at Kristi Holt's and Luis Delgado's."
575,00:31:48,00:31:50,BRODY: These aren't your ordinary B-and-Es.
576,00:31:50,00:31:54,"In all five cases, the homeowners walked in on the robbery."
577,00:31:54,00:31:56,"According to this, walked into a bullet."
578,00:31:56,00:31:59,"Yeah, well, five B-and-Es, four murders and one attempted."
579,00:31:59,00:32:00,Only Delgado escaped death.
580,00:32:00,00:32:02,So what are we supposed to believe?
581,00:32:02,00:32:04,This Jeremy Sikes is just one unlucky burglar?
582,00:32:04,00:32:06,I thought we agreed that luck wasn't a player here.
583,00:32:06,00:32:11,"No, the shootings weren't an accident, and the robberies were cover stories."
584,00:32:11,00:32:16,Remember how Kristi Holt left her husband's watch off of the insurance claim?
585,00:32:16,00:32:18,"Well, the same goes for all of these homeowners."
586,00:32:18,00:32:22,"YEAGER: 22 items stolen, and not one of them reported by the victims' survivors?"
587,00:32:22,00:32:26,"I mean, personally, I... we think that it's payment for services rendered."
588,00:32:26,00:32:28,I agree.
589,00:32:28,00:32:31,We had a case like this up in Seattle.
590,00:32:31,00:32:33,Low-rent hit man for hire ring.
591,00:32:33,00:32:35,Advertised in the personals.
592,00:32:35,00:32:37,"Called themselves ""problem solvers."" They're pretty good, too."
593,00:32:37,00:32:40,Flew under the radar for a long time.
594,00:32:40,00:32:42,So how'd you bust them? Caught a break.
595,00:32:42,00:32:45,Turned out one of the hit men was a coke addict.
596,00:32:45,00:32:49,"Burned through his money, started shooting off his mouth, I guess he became a liability."
597,00:32:49,00:32:52,'Cause the head guy decided to hit the hit man.
598,00:32:52,00:32:54,So Jeremy Sikes became a liability.
599,00:32:54,00:32:56,"Only instead of blow, it was blackjack."
600,00:32:56,00:33:04,"BRODY: All this loot, he should've been flush, but instead, he was living on the streets with his last $200."
601,00:33:04,00:33:06,Sounds like a liability to me.
602,00:33:06,00:33:11,One that the broker decided to eliminate by framing Delgado.
603,00:33:11,00:33:14,The only question is: Who's the broker?
604,00:33:14,00:33:20,"Kristi, in addition to your husband's watch, we also recovered these other items that were stolen by Jeremy Sikes."
605,00:33:20,00:33:23,The... the man who broke into my house.
606,00:33:23,00:33:25,"And murdered your husband, Simon."
607,00:33:25,00:33:29,"RUSSELL: That's roughly, we figure, about $5,000 worth right there."
608,00:33:29,00:33:34,"That's an awful lot of valuable stuff to forget to report, don't you think?"
609,00:33:34,00:33:36,(sighs)
610,00:33:37,00:33:39,"Listen, we know that you..."
611,00:33:39,00:33:41,you bought this watch for Simon for your...
612,00:33:41,00:33:42,"your anniversary, right?"
613,00:33:42,00:33:44,But you did not buy this bracelet for him.
614,00:33:44,00:33:46,Someone else did.
615,00:33:46,00:33:47,Another woman.
616,00:33:47,00:33:49,BRODY: We traced the purchase back to a...
617,00:33:49,00:33:50,Tiana Lee.
618,00:33:53,00:33:55,"Oh, come on, Kristi, we understand."
619,00:33:55,00:33:56,I mean...
620,00:33:56,00:33:58,"you're working two jobs, right?"
621,00:33:58,00:34:02,And you're still in debt because Simon spends the money as fast as you can make it.
622,00:34:05,00:34:06,What happened?
623,00:34:06,00:34:10,"You came back from work one night, he wasn't there."
624,00:34:10,00:34:12,He was out again.
625,00:34:12,00:34:14,Then he shows up.
626,00:34:14,00:34:16,Maybe he's drunk.
627,00:34:16,00:34:18,"And you ask him, ""Where were you?"
628,00:34:18,00:34:21,"What were you doing?"" Maybe he hits you."
629,00:34:22,00:34:25,Maybe he does that a lot.
630,00:34:27,00:34:33,"And then, one day, someone, a friend, suggests a solution."
631,00:34:33,00:34:38,"And all you can think about is getting rid of that pain, all that sadness."
632,00:34:41,00:34:43,"Look, Kristi..."
633,00:34:45,00:34:49,"We know that, in your heart, you are not a killer."
634,00:34:50,00:34:54,And that you... you feel guilty about all of this.
635,00:34:54,00:34:59,But this is your chance to get rid of some of that guilt.
636,00:35:02,00:35:05,By telling us the truth right now.
637,00:35:09,00:35:10,KRISTI: But you're right.
638,00:35:12,00:35:14,About Simon.
639,00:35:14,00:35:16,About the friend.
640,00:35:16,00:35:20,That person gave me an e-mail address of a broker.
641,00:35:20,00:35:24,I was told to follow instructions.
642,00:35:24,00:35:31,"They were going to make it look like a robbery, and I was told to leave certain items off the report."
643,00:35:31,00:35:32,To pay the hit man.
644,00:35:32,00:35:37,I wasn't lying when I said that I never met the guy.
645,00:35:37,00:35:42,Him just... sitting at my table and going on that insane run was just...
646,00:35:42,00:35:44,Dumb luck?
647,00:35:44,00:35:45,What about the broker?
648,00:35:45,00:35:48,"I paid $5,000 up front, and they set up a meet."
649,00:35:48,00:35:49,You remember where?
650,00:35:49,00:35:50,At a pawnshop.
651,00:35:53,00:35:54,Oh.
652,00:35:54,00:35:56,Is this the guy that you paid?
653,00:35:56,00:35:58,No. I think he runs the place.
654,00:35:58,00:35:59,The broker's a woman.
655,00:35:59,00:36:01,Older.
656,00:36:01,00:36:02,She said she hangs out there.
657,00:36:02,00:36:05,(cell phone ringing)
658,00:36:05,00:36:06,Russell.
659,00:36:06,00:36:08,When?
660,00:36:08,00:36:09,What now?
661,00:36:09,00:36:12,"Somebody just went into Ruby's Pawn Shop, shot the place up."
662,00:36:17,00:36:18,"BRODY: Akers, what the hell happened?"
663,00:36:20,00:36:22,"According to Ms. Banks, two armed men entered."
664,00:36:22,00:36:24,They were looking for something.
665,00:36:24,00:36:25,She doesn't know what.
666,00:36:25,00:36:26,"They shot her son, Kyle."
667,00:36:27,00:36:29,"Took her other son, Zeke."
668,00:36:29,00:36:30,Okay. Thanks.
669,00:36:32,00:36:34,(crying)
670,00:36:34,00:36:36,Who would do something like this?
671,00:36:36,00:36:37,I don't know.
672,00:36:37,00:36:39,But I think you do.
673,00:36:39,00:36:40,Excuse me?
674,00:36:40,00:36:42,Kristi Holt gave you up.
675,00:36:42,00:36:46,"We know Jeremy Sikes worked for you as a hit man, and we have a pretty good idea how you terminated his employment."
676,00:36:46,00:36:48,What is wrong with you people?
677,00:36:48,00:36:53,"My son is lying there dead, and now they've got my other boy, Zeke."
678,00:36:53,00:36:55,"Ruby, it's over. I didn't kill Sikes."
679,00:36:55,00:36:57,But I know who did-- it was Delgado.
680,00:36:57,00:37:00,"I mean, the word on the street is it's his signature."
681,00:37:00,00:37:03,"Two shots to the back, bullets dug out."
682,00:37:03,00:37:04,Sikes even tried to write Delgado's name.
683,00:37:04,00:37:06,That is one hell of a story.
684,00:37:06,00:37:09,But word on my street is that you're a sociopath.
685,00:37:09,00:37:11,You're the one who killed Jeremy Sikes...
686,00:37:11,00:37:12,(two gunshots)
687,00:37:12,00:37:15,...and framed Delgado.
688,00:37:17,00:37:20,BRODY: And you know exactly who came here and why.
689,00:37:20,00:37:23,"If you don't come clean, you're going to lose another son."
690,00:37:23,00:37:25,"Come on, Ruby."
691,00:37:25,00:37:26,We know how much you love your boy.
692,00:37:26,00:37:27,"Okay, you're right."
693,00:37:27,00:37:29,"I killed Sikes, but..."
694,00:37:29,00:37:32,my boys didn't know anything about the side business.
695,00:37:32,00:37:43,"Sikes stole this cigar box from Delgado, and it wasn't even worth anything-- it was a few hundred bucks-- but what was inside was worth a lot more."
696,00:37:43,00:37:45,It was 100 grand in heroin.
697,00:37:45,00:37:46,Where are the drugs?
698,00:37:48,00:37:50,I sold them.
699,00:37:51,00:37:53,But Delgado's guys don't know this.
700,00:37:53,00:37:56,"Zeke, he wanted to protect me, so he lied to them."
701,00:37:56,00:38:00,He said he knew what they wanted and he would take them to it.
702,00:38:00,00:38:05,"When Delgado finds out that he lied, he's going to kill him."
703,00:38:07,00:38:09,(indistinct chatter)
704,00:38:12,00:38:13,Back again so soon?
705,00:38:13,00:38:14,"Where's the kid, Delgado?"
706,00:38:14,00:38:16,What kid?
707,00:38:16,00:38:19,"I know you got him in some basement, beating the hell out of him, but he doesn't know anything."
708,00:38:19,00:38:23,You're not going to get your drugs back because his mother has already sold them.
709,00:38:23,00:38:25,They're gone.
710,00:38:25,00:38:27,Are you going to make me ask you again?
711,00:38:27,00:38:28,Where is he?!
712,00:38:28,00:38:31,Hey. I think you need to start showing me a little more respect.
713,00:38:34,00:38:36,"This is my house. Yeah, right."
714,00:38:36,00:38:39,"Look, your lapdog is going to mess on the rug."
715,00:38:39,00:38:41,If he doesn't get his hand off his gun...
716,00:38:41,00:38:43,Or... what are you going to do about it?
717,00:38:46,00:38:47,(patrons screaming)
718,00:38:47,00:38:49,(man groaning)
719,00:38:49,00:38:52,Now that I have your attention...
720,00:38:52,00:38:55,"You tell me where the kid is, and we all go home."
721,00:38:56,00:38:59,Or we all got to die sometime.
722,00:39:01,00:39:03,"You're new in town, so here's your play."
723,00:39:03,00:39:10,"Here's what the guys in Vegas used to say-- in the old Vegas: It's your house, it's your rules."
724,00:39:13,00:39:15,You got that right.
725,00:39:37,00:39:39,I think you got yourself a fan.
726,00:39:39,00:39:43,"(chuckles) No, he just likes the way I handle power tools."
727,00:39:43,00:39:45,"No, I wasn't talking about him."
728,00:39:45,00:39:46,Oh.
729,00:39:46,00:39:48,"Well, congratulations."
730,00:39:48,00:39:50,You got your solve.
731,00:39:50,00:39:52,No. You take it.
732,00:39:52,00:39:55,"I mean, you earned it. I'll catch the next one."
733,00:39:55,00:39:56,Maybe I'll catch it with you.
734,00:39:59,00:40:01,I'll see you around.
735,00:40:01,00:40:03,Yeah.
736,00:40:09,00:40:11,This is nice.
737,00:40:11,00:40:12,I'm glad you could finally get a night off.
738,00:40:12,00:40:15,You should thank Finn. She's covering for me.
739,00:40:15,00:40:17,"You have a... a great group of people here, D.B."
740,00:40:17,00:40:20,"They work so well together, and they're like a family."
741,00:40:20,00:40:23,You should feel good about that.
742,00:40:23,00:40:24,I do.
743,00:40:27,00:40:30,Charlie-- has he made any decisions yet?
744,00:40:30,00:40:32,No. Not yet.
745,00:40:33,00:40:35,And what about you?
746,00:40:37,00:40:38,What's going on?
747,00:40:40,00:40:50,"This last trip to Seattle, I made a pilgrimage to that neighborhood that we used to love to drive through, with the house on the hill, with the view."
748,00:40:50,00:40:51,I remember.
749,00:40:51,00:40:58,"We used to fantasize walking up to the front door, knocking and asking if they would sell it to us."
750,00:40:58,00:41:00,I did that.
751,00:41:00,00:41:04,"And they're an older couple, and they're very open to the idea."
752,00:41:06,00:41:08,"Okay, don't look at me like that."
753,00:41:08,00:41:11,Well... you're serious?
754,00:41:13,00:41:16,We have a house-- here.
755,00:41:16,00:41:18,We've talked about this before.
756,00:41:18,00:41:20,You can't do this job forever.
757,00:41:20,00:41:24,And I don't want to wait forever for this house.
758,00:41:25,00:41:27,Where's this coming from?
759,00:41:27,00:41:29,I'm worried about you.
760,00:41:29,00:41:32,I think... I think this job is getting to you.
761,00:41:32,00:41:34,It's not. I'm fine.
762,00:41:35,00:41:37,I don't believe that.
763,00:41:37,00:41:38,"Well, I'm fine."
764,00:41:47,00:41:49,I'm sorry. Come here.
765,00:41:56,00:42:05,"My work here isn't done yet, but when it is, when that day comes, you and I will go back up to Seattle, and we'll..."
766,00:42:05,00:42:07,we'll both knock on that door together.
767,00:42:09,00:42:11,I promise.
768,00:42:14,00:42:16,I accept.
