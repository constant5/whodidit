0	00:01:10	00:01:11	Who found him?
1	00:01:11	00:01:17	The police were sweeping the area looking for vagrants, trying to keep 'em above water.
2	00:01:17	00:01:18	Take a look at his nose.
3	00:01:21	00:01:22	Same thing with his chin...
4	00:01:24	00:01:26	His elbows...
5	00:01:26	00:01:27	And his knees.
6	00:01:27	00:01:29	He lost all his points.
7	00:01:30	00:01:31	Like a rock in a tumbler.
8	00:01:31	00:01:33	I'm sorry I'm late.
9	00:01:33	00:01:35	Stopped to get my waders.
10	00:01:38	00:01:40	No wallet.
11	00:01:41	00:01:44	Hold on.
12	00:01:44	00:01:46	What do you think?
13	00:01:46	00:01:49	I'll get it to Narco.
14	00:01:49	00:01:51	Take a look.
15	00:01:52	00:01:54	Cause of death?
16	00:01:54	00:01:56	Water pressure could have done it.
17	00:01:56	00:01:57	Or a person.
18	00:02:00	00:02:01	Hey.
19	00:02:01	00:02:02	Whoo!
20	00:02:02	00:02:03	It's a mess.
21	00:02:03	00:02:06	I've talked to every resident in the area.
22	00:02:06	00:02:07	No one knows this guy.
23	00:02:08	00:02:09	No unaccounted‐for vehicles.
24	00:02:09	00:02:11	I don't know what to tell you.
25	00:02:11	00:02:14	Well, at least we know where he came from.
26	00:02:18	00:02:20	Aren't we at least gonna draw straws?
27	00:02:20	00:02:21	No.
28	00:02:46	00:02:49	We must be under the freeway by now.
29	00:02:50	00:02:52	Hey.
30	00:02:52	00:02:58	Did I ever tell you that the city paid me a dollar a square foot to rip out my lawn and replace it with rocks because we're in a drought?
31	00:02:58	00:02:59	Are you kidding me?
32	00:02:59	00:03:00	No.
33	00:03:00	00:03:02	This city was not made for rain.
34	00:03:37	00:03:38	Catherine.
35	00:03:46	00:03:48	Grissom.
36	00:03:48	00:03:49	We got another body.
37	00:03:51	00:03:54	I was taking a nap.
38	00:04:29	00:04:30	I'm real tired, okay?
39	00:04:30	00:04:32	I just want to get some sleep.
40	00:04:32	00:04:34	I understand, I understand.
41	00:04:34	00:04:36	Listen, I need to ask you a question.
42	00:04:36	00:04:38	Have you ever seen this guy right here?
43	00:04:38	00:04:40	No.
44	00:04:40	00:04:42	You don't know him?
45	00:04:42	00:04:48	No, someone comes down here that don't belong, I mean, bad stuff can happen, okay?
46	00:04:48	00:04:50	I‐I‐I just want to go home, okay?
47	00:04:50	00:04:54	A‐a‐and you can't make me leave my house.
48	00:04:54	00:04:56	Nobody's making you do anything, okay?
49	00:04:56	00:04:57	Now, you like coffee?
50	00:04:58	00:05:04	Well, yeah, as long as it's a decaf, one sugar, two cream, no skim, and hot‐‐ your lawsuit hot.
51	00:05:04	00:05:06	Okay, you go with that officer over there.
52	00:05:06	00:05:08	He'll get you a nice cup of coffee, all right?
53	00:05:27	00:05:29	Is that you, Warrick?
54	00:05:30	00:05:32	There you are.
55	00:05:32	00:05:33	Phew.
56	00:05:38	00:05:40	Is that a sneaker?
57	00:05:40	00:05:42	Looks like an Aquasock.
58	00:05:42	00:05:44	Yeah.
59	00:05:44	00:05:45	Here's its mate.
60	00:05:48	00:05:50	Kind of upscale for a tunnel rat.
61	00:05:50	00:05:52	So the vic was barefoot.
62	00:05:52	00:05:56	The tunnel's full of murder weapons.
63	00:05:56	00:06:00	Bum kills him, or finds the body and takes the socks?
64	00:06:00	00:06:03	What was the guy doing here in the first place?
65	00:06:03	00:06:07	Well, maybe the vic was some punk, uh... with an attitude.
66	00:06:07	00:06:08	Decided to take it out on some homeless guy.
67	00:06:08	00:06:09	You never know. It happens.
68	00:06:09	00:06:14	The way the body was ground down means that the water took him for a pretty long ride.
69	00:06:14	00:06:16	Well, we're already wet, so...
70	00:06:24	00:06:25	Yeah. Yeah.
71	00:06:25	00:06:27	Yeah.
72	00:06:27	00:06:29	Excuse me!
73	00:06:29	00:06:31	Down here!
74	00:06:32	00:06:33	Oh.
75	00:06:33	00:06:35	What's your problem, sweetie?
76	00:06:35	00:06:36	Uh, no problem, sir.
77	00:06:36	00:06:40	I'm just wanting to know what street I'm on. Under.
78	00:06:40	00:06:43	Oh, it's, uh, Industrial.
79	00:06:43	00:06:45	You're just south of Tropicana.
80	00:06:45	00:06:46	Thank you.
81	00:06:46	00:06:48	And I'm not holding the bus.
82	00:06:49	00:06:51	Don't bother.
83	00:06:51	00:06:55	All right, so we're about a mile south of where we started.
84	00:06:55	00:07:01	Well, there's 300 miles of storm drains in Clark County, so we only have 299 to go.
85	00:07:01	00:07:03	What, do we, uh, eenie‐meenie‐minie‐mo it?
86	00:07:03	00:07:05	Split up? What do we do?
87	00:07:05	00:07:07	No, that's a dead end.
88	00:07:11	00:07:13	Sunscreen on a lanyard.
89	00:07:13	00:07:17	Fits with the Aquasocks.
90	00:07:17	00:07:20	I say we keep going upstream.
91	00:07:20	00:07:22	I knew you were gonna say that.
92	00:07:23	00:07:24	Don't hit your head.
93	00:07:47	00:07:49	I'm gonna need the drain pan.
94	00:08:03	00:08:06	This town isn't built for rain, hmm?
95	00:08:27	00:08:29	Come on, don't be shy.
96	00:08:29	00:08:31	Take a good look.
97	00:08:37	00:08:39	In the end...
98	00:08:39	00:08:41	it's all we really are.
99	00:08:51	00:08:54	If you're gonna be sick, Greg, do it in the sink.
100	00:08:54	00:08:56	Not in the drain pan.
101	00:08:56	00:08:58	I don't feel sick.
102	00:09:04	00:09:05	Take a look at the trachea.
103	00:09:05	00:09:07	What do you see?
104	00:09:09	00:09:10	Foam.
105	00:09:10	00:09:12	Like the head of a beer.
106	00:09:13	00:09:14	Sorry.
107	00:09:15	00:09:17	No. It's a good analogy.
108	00:09:17	00:09:20	Pulmonary edema, fluids in the air passages.
109	00:09:20	00:09:22	So he drowned?
110	00:09:22	00:09:24	Well, doesn't prove it.
111	00:09:24	00:09:27	Same thing happens with, uh, heart failure or drug overdose.
112	00:09:27	00:09:38	But the fact that the heart of the victim was a normal size, and assuming tox doesn't show drug overdose, C.O.D. is most likely drowning, but I'm not gonna rule out blunt‐force trauma.
113	00:09:43	00:09:45	Daylight. Finally.
114	00:09:45	00:09:47	We gotta be into some golden time by now, right?
115	00:09:47	00:09:49	Oh, yeah. For real.
116	00:09:50	00:09:53	Ka‐ching, Ka‐ching.
117	00:09:53	00:09:55	What do we have here?
118	00:09:56	00:09:58	Brain bucket.
119	00:10:03	00:10:05	Hang on to that.
120	00:10:05	00:10:06	Hey, it's our dead guy.
121	00:10:06	00:10:07	No way.
122	00:10:08	00:10:10	Calvin Berkowitz.
123	00:10:10	00:10:11	Worked at the Tangiers.
124	00:10:11	00:10:12	Lifeguard.
125	00:10:13	00:10:16	So what's Calvin doing down here?
126	00:10:24	00:10:25	It's an inner tube.
127	00:10:25	00:10:26	Yeah?
128	00:10:26	00:10:29	Guy gets the day off and decides to go surfing...
129	00:10:29	00:10:31	Vegas style.
130	00:10:31	00:10:34	Oh, I heard about that.
131	00:10:34	00:10:35	He grabs an inner tube, a helmet, jumps into the channel.
132	00:10:36	00:10:38	Hits his head on something, drowns.
133	00:10:38	00:10:39	So it takes him down.
134	00:10:39	00:10:41	That would account for all that body trauma.
135	00:10:42	00:10:45	This isn't about drugs or beating up homeless dudes.
136	00:10:45	00:10:48	It's just plain stupidity.
137	00:10:49	00:10:52	Well, that's what happens when you don't have a decent beach in Vegas.
138	00:10:54	00:10:55	Hey, you know something?
139	00:10:55	00:10:57	This is, uh, right around where I found Lindsay.
140	00:10:57	00:10:58	Really?
141	00:10:58	00:11:02	Yeah, when Eddie's car went off the road.
142	00:11:02	00:11:03	Ugh... Let's just get out of here.
143	00:11:03	00:11:05	Can you take that?
144	00:11:06	00:11:08	Watch your step.
145	00:11:08	00:11:09	Hey.
146	00:11:09	00:11:10	Oh.
147	00:11:11	00:11:12	You all right?
148	00:11:12	00:11:13	Yeah, I think.
149	00:11:13	00:11:14	Whoa.
150	00:11:16	00:11:19	Hey!
151	00:11:19	00:11:20	You guys CSI?
152	00:11:22	00:11:23	Yeah.
153	00:11:24	00:11:28	Well, the city's been rehabbing manholes with fiberglass liners.
154	00:11:28	00:11:32	All the hydrogen sulfide down there really eats up the concrete.
155	00:11:32	00:11:37	Anyways, we, uh, pulled these out of the main.
156	00:11:37	00:11:41	We find a lot of small animal bones down there, squirrels, cats, rats, you know.
157	00:11:41	00:11:43	but that's really tiny stuff.
158	00:11:43	00:11:44	This looks more like people.
159	00:11:45	00:11:48	Fingers or toes, or fingers and toes.
160	00:11:48	00:11:50	Well, animal bones can fool you.
161	00:11:50	00:11:54	Pig's feet or sheep ribs are not much different from yours or mine.
162	00:11:54	00:11:56	Flaky texture.
163	00:11:56	00:11:58	Probably a couple years old.
164	00:12:03	00:12:06	Yep. We're gonna have to flush the line.
165	00:12:09	00:12:12	You guys get a lot of jokes about this thing?
166	00:12:12	00:12:15	What do you think?
167	00:12:31	00:12:33	Vactor's in place.
168	00:12:33	00:12:36	Ready when you are.
169	00:12:36	00:12:38	Rip it.
170	00:12:38	00:12:40	Let's go.
171	00:12:56	00:12:57	Warrick.
172	00:12:58	00:12:59	Yo.
173	00:12:59	00:13:01	I got some bones here.
174	00:13:01	00:13:05	Anything distinctive?
175	00:13:05	00:13:07	Yeah. I got part of a rib.
176	00:13:07	00:13:10	Uh‐huh. I can see the costal groove.
177	00:13:10	00:13:13	And it's too deep to be an animal's.
178	00:13:13	00:13:14	These bones are human.
179	00:13:18	00:13:20	This is the sewage vault where they found the bones.
180	00:13:20	00:13:23	How do we know the bones just didn't wash off the street?
181	00:13:23	00:13:26	Well, wastewater sewage is a closed system.
182	00:13:26	00:13:29	It's completely separate from the storm drains.
183	00:13:29	00:13:33	Someone must have flushed it down a toilet, a sink, a tub, or tossed them directly into a manhole.
184	00:13:33	00:13:39	And the bones look pretty old, so it could just be from a grave robber getting rid of his leftovers.
185	00:13:39	00:13:41	Or a serial killer with a lot of patience.
186	00:13:42	00:13:46	200,000 service connections, serving half a million residences.
187	00:13:46	00:13:51	1,600 miles of pipe, gravity fed.
188	00:13:51	00:13:54	If we're gonna find where the bones came from, we gotta work our way up.
189	00:14:28	00:14:30	Catherine.
190	00:14:30	00:14:31	Recovered more bones.
191	00:14:32	00:14:33	Oh.
192	00:14:33	00:14:35	Pelvis fragment and two humerus.
193	00:14:35	00:14:40	Well, large bones wouldn't travel down the line as far as the small ones, so at least we're getting closer to the source.
194	00:14:40	00:14:42	These plumbers must be working overtime.
195	00:14:42	00:14:44	Lots of backed up toilets.
196	00:14:44	00:14:47	I don't think the bones could have come from any one of these houses.
197	00:14:47	00:14:49	Residential sewer lines are only four‐inch pipes.
198	00:14:49	00:14:50	Okay.
199	00:14:50	00:14:53	And they make a 90‐degree turn before they connect to the main.
200	00:14:53	00:14:54	Look at the size of these bones.
201	00:14:54	00:14:55	Yeah.
202	00:14:55	00:14:57	They're too big to make a turn like that.
203	00:14:57	00:15:00	Right. So the blockage has gotta be from the main line.
204	00:15:01	00:15:03	One more vault down the street.
205	00:15:11	00:15:13	Jackpot.
206	00:15:15	00:15:16	Oh, man.
207	00:15:19	00:15:20	I'll go check it out.
208	00:15:32	00:15:34	It's like a waterline stain.
209	00:15:38	00:15:41	Hand me my florazene and my glasses, please.
210	00:15:41	00:15:42	Uh.
211	00:15:44	00:15:52	Florazene reacts to feces as well as blood, so I know that you're not looking for blood.
212	00:15:52	00:15:55	No. These vaults are built big for access.
213	00:15:56	00:15:58	They're not reservoirs.
214	00:15:58	00:16:01	Water's supposed to stay down in the pipes.
215	00:16:01	00:16:04	And the only way the water would rise is if there's something blocking the pipe.
216	00:16:04	00:16:05	Mm‐hmm.
217	00:16:05	00:16:08	And loose bones wouldn't do that.
218	00:16:08	00:16:10	But a whole body would.
219	00:16:12	00:16:15	Water rises, submerges the body.
220	00:16:15	00:16:22	Tissue decomposes until there's not enough body left to withstand the pressure.
221	00:16:28	00:16:32	I don't think we're looking for a grave robber.
222	00:16:32	00:16:35	We're looking for a murderer.
223	00:16:39	00:16:44	Femur measurements make your victim around five foot six.
224	00:16:44	00:16:50	Pubic arch, mm, sharply angled, less than 90‐degrees, indicates male.
225	00:16:50	00:16:51	I'll send it to Greg.
226	00:16:51	00:16:53	He might be able to pull DNA.
227	00:16:53	00:16:54	Look at this.
228	00:16:54	00:16:57	Incise defect on the left fifth rib.
229	00:16:57	00:16:58	Incise defect on the left third rib.
230	00:16:58	00:17:01	Well, the tool marks appear consistent with each other.
231	00:17:02	00:17:07	Probably made before decomposition, and not from hitting any obstruction in the sewer line.
232	00:17:07	00:17:08	Stab wounds.
233	00:17:08	00:17:14	Two separate strikes back to front would have punctured the lung.
234	00:17:14	00:17:16	What about age?
235	00:17:16	00:17:18	I'll let you know.
236	00:17:24	00:17:32	Okay, let's start with the houses within eyeshot of the manhole, and then we'll work our way out from there. Hmm? Okay.
237	00:17:34	00:17:37	You really, really ought to have the one with chocolate icing.
238	00:17:37	00:17:39	Hello, Officer.
239	00:17:39	00:17:40	Oh, dear.
240	00:17:40	00:17:41	Detective.
241	00:17:41	00:17:44	Detective. Sorry, I...
242	00:17:44	00:17:49	Uh, just a little something for you and your boys, uh, a token of appreciation for local law enforcement.
243	00:17:49	00:17:50	You mind standing behind the tape?
244	00:17:50	00:17:52	It's for your own safety.
245	00:17:52	00:17:53	There you go.
246	00:17:53	00:17:56	Go ahead.
247	00:17:56	00:17:58	Coffee's fresh.
248	00:17:58	00:17:59	Didn't even spit in it.
249	00:18:02	00:18:05	Not that I ever would. I, I love cops.
250	00:18:05	00:18:06	What's your name?
251	00:18:06	00:18:08	Marty, uh, Martin Kessler.
252	00:18:08	00:18:09	I live here...
253	00:18:09	00:18:12	there, right over there, number 2305.
254	00:18:12	00:18:16	So, uh, does this have anything to do with the missing cats?
255	00:18:17	00:18:20	People have lost a lot of pets in this neighborhood.
256	00:18:20	00:18:22	Too many, if you get my drift.
257	00:18:22	00:18:24	Well, you know, Marty, I'm really not at liberty to say.
258	00:18:24	00:18:27	But did you see anybody throw any stuff down that sewer?
259	00:18:27	00:18:32	Not personally, but, uh, I know kids around here throw fireworks...
260	00:18:32	00:18:34	illegal, down there.
261	00:18:34	00:18:36	Kaboom! Kaboom!
262	00:18:36	00:18:39	00 in the morning.
263	00:18:39	00:18:41	Kids have no respect for the law.
264	00:19:00	00:19:01	I heard you finally lost your virginity.
265	00:19:03	00:19:05	First autopsy. How was it?
266	00:19:05	00:19:07	It was fine.
267	00:19:07	00:19:08	How was your first time?
268	00:19:08	00:19:09	How did you react?
269	00:19:09	00:19:12	I puked.
270	00:19:13	00:19:14	I didn't puke.
271	00:19:14	00:19:16	Way to go, tough guy.
272	00:19:18	00:19:22	It was weird, seeing a body laying on a table like that.
273	00:19:22	00:19:28	Doc Robbins just pulling out his insides until it was all empty.
274	00:19:28	00:19:30	Were you expecting a ball of light?
275	00:19:31	00:19:33	Doc Robbins said, That's all we really are.
276	00:19:33	00:19:36	It's what you do with it that counts.
277	00:19:39	00:19:46	Victim had incomplete formation of the second molar root tips, and his wisdom teeth hadn't erupted.
278	00:19:46	00:19:47	Teenager.
279	00:19:47	00:19:49	Yeah, approximately 13 to 15.
280	00:19:49	00:19:53	Eye orbits rounded, almost oval.
281	00:19:53	00:19:56	Nasal aperture narrow and tall, jawline flat.
282	00:19:56	00:19:58	Likely Caucasian.
283	00:19:58	00:20:01	Uh, dental records are out to NCIC.
284	00:20:01	00:20:02	That's all I've got.
285	00:20:02	00:20:03	How'd Greg do?
286	00:20:03	00:20:04	Bones are too degraded.
287	00:20:04	00:20:06	No viable DNA, not even in the teeth.
288	00:20:06	00:20:08	Well, it's a bit of a long shot.
289	00:20:08	00:20:09	Sewer's a chemical stew.
290	00:20:09	00:20:13	Maybe Catherine will get lucky with Missing Persons.
291	00:20:13	00:20:17	Okay, I opened the age range to give us a better margin for error.
292	00:20:17	00:20:25	Currently 47 male Caucasians between the age of 12 and 16 missing from the Greater Las Vegas Metro district.
293	00:20:26	00:20:27	Okay. Geography first?
294	00:20:27	00:20:29	Mm‐hmm.
295	00:20:29	00:20:31	Body was found here.
296	00:20:31	00:20:36	These are the last‐known residences of the missing persons.
297	00:20:36	00:20:38	There's no one particularly close.
298	00:20:38	00:20:40	I'll narrow it down.
299	00:20:40	00:20:42	Two‐mile radius.
300	00:20:42	00:20:48	Missing five weeks, eleven weeks, eleven months.
301	00:20:48	00:20:49	That's not long enough.
302	00:20:49	00:20:53	The condition of the bones suggested the body's been decomposing for at least two years.
303	00:20:53	00:20:55	Okay, I'll go wider.
304	00:20:55	00:20:56	Five miles.
305	00:21:12	00:21:13	What are you doing?
306	00:21:13	00:21:15	Good. You're here.
307	00:21:15	00:21:17	Fill this up for me, will ya?
308	00:21:17	00:21:19	With what?
309	00:21:19	00:21:20	It's a urine specimen cup, Greg.
310	00:21:20	00:21:21	What do you think?
311	00:21:24	00:21:25	Okay.
312	00:21:49	00:21:51	That took a long time.
313	00:21:51	00:21:52	You may need a prostate exam.
314	00:21:52	00:21:54	My prostate is just fine.
315	00:21:54	00:21:56	I'm not a soda fountain.
316	00:21:56	00:21:59	Hopefully you are, 'cause I need a number two as quickly as possible.
317	00:22:02	00:22:04	What is this all about?
318	00:22:04	00:22:06	The victim's body was found in a sewer.
319	00:22:06	00:22:08	Ambient temperature 80 degrees.
320	00:22:08	00:22:12	The corrosive chemicals caused the body to decompose faster than normal.
321	00:22:12	00:22:14	I want to find out how much faster.
322	00:22:16	00:22:17	Today.
323	00:22:20	00:22:24	This is some kind of CSI hazing.
324	00:22:24	00:22:26	Make me appreciate blood and semen more.
325	00:22:26	00:22:30	I mean, since we don't have a solid time frame, it's kind of tough to jog memories.
326	00:22:31	00:22:34	But nobody saw anybody throw anything like a body down that manhole.
327	00:22:35	00:22:39	But several people suggested we talk to this high school kid, Owen Durbin.
328	00:22:39	00:22:40	Now, he's a neighborhood bully.
329	00:22:40	00:22:43	He likes to throw cherry bombs in there and hear 'em go boom.
330	00:22:43	00:22:45	Uh, guys, how are we supposed to get through the door?
331	00:22:45	00:22:48	There's no evidence linking this kid to the bones.
332	00:22:48	00:22:50	We're not looking for bones.
333	00:22:50	00:22:53	Illegal use of fireworks? This is crap.
334	00:22:53	00:22:55	We've had several complaints from your neighbors, sir.
335	00:22:55	00:22:56	No one's complained to me.
336	00:22:57	00:22:58	Well, ( chuckles )
337	00:22:58	00:23:00	this is gonna happen, so please step outside.
338	00:23:00	00:23:01	Ask your family to come with you.
339	00:23:01	00:23:03	Thank you.
340	00:23:04	00:23:06	Come on, guys.
341	00:23:06	00:23:08	Let's go.
342	00:23:11	00:23:15	Anything happens in here, it's your fault.
343	00:23:16	00:23:17	Okay.
344	00:23:33	00:23:34	Whoa.
345	00:23:35	00:23:39	Lot of ammo here, all different caliber.
346	00:23:39	00:23:42	Means multiple weapons are present... somewhere.
347	00:23:42	00:23:43	Yeah?
348	00:23:44	00:23:46	I got a shotgun under the couch.
349	00:23:50	00:23:52	Oh, yeah.
350	00:23:56	00:23:59	Loaded.
351	00:24:04	00:24:07	Sounds like we got some nasty dogs out back.
352	00:24:25	00:24:27	I think I got blood.
353	00:24:48	00:24:49	Confirmed.
354	00:24:49	00:24:53	Okay. I'm gonna get the warrant amended for blood evidence collection. Until then...
355	00:24:53	00:24:55	We stop searching.
356	00:24:55	00:24:56	Won't take long, so hang loose.
357	00:24:56	00:24:59	And I'll get the Animal Control to get these mutts out of here.
358	00:25:05	00:25:08	So, uh, no searching.
359	00:25:08	00:25:10	Yeah, right.
360	00:25:37	00:25:38	That closet's well stocked, huh?
361	00:25:53	00:25:55	Sara?
362	00:25:55	00:25:57	I'm not touching anything.
363	00:25:57	00:26:01	No. Put your stuff down and step away from the closet.
364	00:26:01	00:26:03	What?
365	00:26:03	00:26:07	Put down your stuff and step away from the closet.
366	00:26:19	00:26:20	Those are pipe bombs.
367	00:26:20	00:26:22	Yeah.
368	00:26:25	00:26:26	( walkie talkie beeps ) Dispatch...
369	00:26:26	00:26:27	this is CSI Brown.
370	00:26:27	00:26:29	We're at the Durbin residence.
371	00:26:29	00:26:31	We have explosives on the scene.
372	00:26:31	00:26:32	Roll out Bomb Squad immediately.
373	00:26:32	00:26:34	Roll out Bomb Squad.
374	00:26:35	00:26:36	What are you doing?
375	00:26:36	00:26:39	There's blood evidence on the door.
376	00:26:39	00:26:42	If the bomb squad detonates the place, it's gone. Sara.
377	00:26:42	00:26:45	It'll only take a second.
378	00:26:52	00:26:54	Here, try this.
379	00:27:01	00:27:02	Nice.
380	00:27:13	00:27:15	It's stuck.
381	00:27:15	00:27:17	I think we're gonna need a little push.
382	00:27:17	00:27:19	All right.
383	00:27:19	00:27:22	On three.
384	00:27:22	00:27:24	One...
385	00:27:24	00:27:26	two...
386	00:27:26	00:27:27	three.
387	00:27:31	00:27:34	Can we get the hell out of dodge now?
388	00:27:46	00:27:48	Let's go over again what you found on the scene.
389	00:27:48	00:27:49	Six pipe bombs.
390	00:27:49	00:27:51	Anything else?
391	00:27:51	00:27:53	Not that we know of.
392	00:27:53	00:27:57	Give me another 50 yards, okay!
393	00:27:57	00:27:58	That includes you.
394	00:27:59	00:28:00	You got it.
395	00:28:03	00:28:04	So tell me something...
396	00:28:04	00:28:10	what's a guy who sells life insurance doing with a half a dozen pipe bombs?
397	00:28:10	00:28:11	Huh?
398	00:28:11	00:28:13	I mean, you got a grudge against the government?
399	00:28:13	00:28:14	Is this a Timothy McVeigh thing?
400	00:28:15	00:28:18	Or... you just have a weird fascination with watching things go boom?
401	00:28:18	00:28:20	I've never been arrested for anything.
402	00:28:20	00:28:22	I've never hurt anybody.
403	00:28:22	00:28:23	You got a wife and a kid.
404	00:28:23	00:28:24	Aren't you afraid they might get hurt?
405	00:28:24	00:28:27	Well, I don't know about you, but in my house, there's rules.
406	00:28:27	00:28:29	Terry and Owen know what to do and what not to do.
407	00:28:30	00:28:31	Well, clearly you don't.
408	00:28:32	00:28:33	The bombs are a Class‐B felony.
409	00:28:33	00:28:37	The penalty is one to six years in prison for each device.
410	00:28:37	00:28:39	And murder is 25 to life.
411	00:28:39	00:28:42	Somebody gets blown up, it's nothing to do with me.
412	00:28:42	00:28:45	I told you not to go in my house.
413	00:28:45	00:28:46	We found blood in your house.
414	00:28:46	00:28:48	Then you must have put it there.
415	00:28:48	00:28:49	Oh, yeah? How about this?
416	00:28:49	00:28:53	We found a body in the sewer in front of your house.
417	00:28:53	00:28:57	Did we put that there?
418	00:28:57	00:28:59	I don't know anything about it.
419	00:28:59	00:29:02	So what were you trying to prove with this door?
420	00:29:02	00:29:05	I was just collecting evidence.
421	00:29:05	00:29:10	Well, Greg couldn't pull any DNA from the bones, so there's nothing to connect the victim to this anyway.
422	00:29:10	00:29:11	Not yet.
423	00:29:14	00:29:18	I don't have a death wish, and I'm not a drunk, in case you were worried.
424	00:29:18	00:29:22	I'm not worried.
425	00:29:22	00:29:24	I'm concerned.
426	00:29:30	00:29:33	Isn't that kind of the same thing?
427	00:29:39	00:29:40	Oh...
428	00:29:46	00:29:47	How are you doing with victim ID?
429	00:29:48	00:29:53	So far we've followed up on 11 missing persons who fit the profile, ruled out every one by case history.
430	00:29:53	00:29:54	What's the most recent case?
431	00:29:54	00:29:57	Well, we're only looking at people who've been missing more than a year.
432	00:29:57	00:29:58	The condition of the bones...
433	00:29:58	00:29:59	Was misleading.
434	00:29:59	00:30:02	Tissue in a sewer decomposes 20 times faster than normal.
435	00:30:02	00:30:05	The victim could be missing as little as five weeks.
436	00:30:35	00:30:37	Are we clear to get back in there?
437	00:30:37	00:30:38	We're not through.
438	00:30:38	00:30:39	We swept the house for booby traps.
439	00:30:39	00:30:42	It was clean, but we still haven't done a full search yet.
440	00:30:42	00:30:45	Well, why don't you clear an area and we'll process behind you.
441	00:30:45	00:30:47	Scene will still be under my authority.
442	00:30:47	00:30:50	I don't have a problem with authority.
443	00:30:50	00:30:51	Fire in the hole!
444	00:30:56	00:30:59	This is Travis's ninth grade picture.
445	00:30:59	00:31:03	His father, my son, was a punk.
446	00:31:03	00:31:06	He, uh, skipped out just after Travis was born.
447	00:31:07	00:31:11	His mother's in Salt Lake. She's a junkie.
448	00:31:11	00:31:16	The only time she ever called Travis was to use him to get money out of me.
449	00:31:16	00:31:19	I mean, she can barely take care of herself, let alone a kid.
450	00:31:19	00:31:21	You know how many times I told him that.
451	00:31:22	00:31:25	Well, most of the time kids believe what they want to believe, you know.
452	00:31:25	00:31:28	Did he run off to see his mom?
453	00:31:28	00:31:30	Mm. Yeah, it wasn't the first time.
454	00:31:30	00:31:35	He's, uh... About six weeks ago, I come home to a note.
455	00:31:35	00:31:37	So I called his mom, and...
456	00:31:37	00:31:39	He just never, he never showed up.
457	00:31:39	00:31:44	Ms. Giles, do you, uh, do you recognize this boy?
458	00:31:46	00:31:48	No.
459	00:31:48	00:31:49	No? Mm‐mm.
460	00:31:50	00:31:53	Do you have anything of Travis's he might have used on his body?
461	00:31:53	00:31:56	Like a toothbrush, hairbrush, anything like that?
462	00:31:57	00:31:58	No, he took all that kind of thing with him when he left.
463	00:31:58	00:31:59	Mmm.
464	00:31:59	00:32:00	Why?
465	00:32:00	00:32:04	Well, it would help if I could get a sample of Travis's DNA.
466	00:32:05	00:32:06	Look...
467	00:32:07	00:32:10	ma'am, I don't really know how to say this...
468	00:32:10	00:32:11	Don't bother.
469	00:32:11	00:32:13	I know he's dead.
470	00:32:16	00:32:18	Is this a classmate of yours, Owen?
471	00:32:18	00:32:20	No.
472	00:32:20	00:32:21	Okay, let's try that again.
473	00:32:21	00:32:24	You two went to the same middle school, right?
474	00:32:24	00:32:27	Maybe. I guess.
475	00:32:27	00:32:29	You guess. Were you friends?
476	00:32:29	00:32:31	I know my son's friends.
477	00:32:31	00:32:33	That's not one of them.
478	00:32:33	00:32:36	Mrs. Durbin, may I speak with you for a minute in private?
479	00:32:36	00:32:38	Excuse us, Owen.
480	00:32:43	00:32:47	You know, sometimes kids get self‐conscious around their parents.
481	00:32:47	00:32:50	Maybe it would be better if I spoke to Owen by myself.
482	00:32:51	00:32:55	He'll have an advocate present to make sure his rights are respected. Okay?
483	00:32:58	00:33:02	I'm not leaving my son alone with you.
484	00:33:02	00:33:04	My husband wouldn't like that.
485	00:33:24	00:33:26	Medium‐velocity spatter.
486	00:33:26	00:33:29	This looks like the point of origin.
487	00:33:45	00:33:48	Yeah, this is Catherine Willows for Captain Brass.
488	00:33:51	00:33:54	Tell me about the blood in your house.
489	00:33:54	00:33:57	Blood? Where?
490	00:33:57	00:34:00	Well, the top of the stairs for starters.
491	00:34:00	00:34:03	I don't know what you're talking about.
492	00:34:05	00:34:06	You do.
493	00:34:06	00:34:09	I don't.
494	00:34:09	00:34:10	Maybe it's the dogs'.
495	00:34:12	00:34:15	When they go upstairs sometimes, sometimes they fight.
496	00:34:15	00:34:16	They fight a lot.
497	00:34:18	00:34:23	Animal Control said the Durbins' pit bulls showed no signs of recent injury.
498	00:34:23	00:34:24	Dogs heal fast.
499	00:34:24	00:34:26	I guess I'll go back to the lab and get a hematrace.
500	00:34:26	00:34:27	Don't bother.
501	00:34:28	00:34:31	The lowest point of spatter is 46 inches above the ground with a downward angle.
502	00:34:31	00:34:35	Even if those dogs could walk upright, they couldn't have done this.
503	00:34:35	00:34:37	Kid's a liar.
504	00:34:58	00:35:00	I'm not done yet.
505	00:35:01	00:35:03	Take your time.
506	00:35:04	00:35:05	Got some det cord here.
507	00:35:05	00:35:07	Isn't that high explosive?
508	00:35:07	00:35:10	Stuff designed to be humped around by grunts.
509	00:35:10	00:35:12	You gotta want it go off.
510	00:35:12	00:35:15	Only one thing you need to worry about.
511	00:35:15	00:35:19	Ever see me running, make sure you keep up.
512	00:35:20	00:35:21	Got it.
513	00:36:49	00:36:53	Hey, Rick, watch your step.
514	00:36:54	00:36:57	This could be blood evidence on the floor.
515	00:36:59	00:37:04	Okay, Grissom, I located some burnt clothes in a barrel out in the back.
516	00:37:04	00:37:10	I'm thinking he was killed in the house, dragged out back and then dumped.
517	00:37:10	00:37:12	He might have been dragged in here.
518	00:37:12	00:37:13	Make sure you bag that stuff.
519	00:37:13	00:37:15	Yeah, I'm all over it.
520	00:37:48	00:37:50	Don't touch a thing.
521	00:37:50	00:37:51	Get out now.
522	00:37:51	00:37:54	Uh, I think I have some evidence back here.
523	00:37:54	00:37:56	Clear out now.
524	00:37:58	00:37:59	Hey!
525	00:37:59	00:38:01	The garage is packed with liquid explosives.
526	00:38:01	00:38:03	They're gonna detonate in place.
527	00:38:03	00:38:06	So grab what's important and get out now.
528	00:38:06	00:38:07	That means you, too, Sara.
529	00:38:07	00:38:09	Right now.
530	00:38:32	00:38:34	Fire in the hole!
531	00:38:34	00:38:36	Fire in the hole!
532	00:38:43	00:38:44	Sons of bitches!
533	00:38:44	00:38:47	I'm gonna sue your ass into the ground.
534	00:38:47	00:38:48	I hope you know that.
535	00:38:48	00:38:49	Yeah. I'm gonna own you.
536	00:38:50	00:38:51	I'm gonna own this whole place.
537	00:38:51	00:38:53	In fact, maybe that's where I'll live.
538	00:38:53	00:38:54	I'm just gonna move in here.
539	00:38:54	00:38:56	Let me guess. He lawyered up.
540	00:38:56	00:38:59	Yeah, he stopped talking after I told him we blew up his house.
541	00:38:59	00:39:01	And what about the wife and son?
542	00:39:02	00:39:03	They're still in play.
543	00:39:03	00:39:04	How much longer is anybody's guess.
544	00:39:04	00:39:06	But, uh, we need something more to go back at them with.
545	00:39:06	00:39:12	Well, I think at this point we can agree that the murder weapon was a knife.
546	00:39:12	00:39:17	These are pictures of a box of knives that I was unable to recover from the Durbin garage.
547	00:39:20	00:39:21	So how about the tool marks?
548	00:39:21	00:39:25	I cast the stab marks in the victim's ribs.
549	00:39:25	00:39:28	Bone deterioration removed all the individual characteristics.
550	00:39:28	00:39:31	The best we can do is rule out the serrated blade.
551	00:39:31	00:39:33	Hey, what about the kid's videos?
552	00:39:33	00:39:36	Uh, no tape of the murder or body he dumped so far.
553	00:39:36	00:39:38	I'm not holding my breath.
554	00:39:38	00:39:39	Videos cover several years.
555	00:39:39	00:39:41	Kid running around the house.
556	00:39:41	00:39:42	Backyard barbecue kind of stuff.
557	00:39:42	00:39:45	You know, home movies.
558	00:39:45	00:39:47	A teenage boy with a shoe box full of home movies under his bed?
559	00:39:48	00:39:49	It's weird, I know.
560	00:39:49	00:39:50	I'm still looking.
561	00:39:50	00:39:53	Well, we know Owen went to school with Travis Giles, right?
562	00:39:53	00:39:57	Well, that was a few years back, and we still can't place Travis at the house.
563	00:39:57	00:40:01	With all the fire damage, the clothes are the right size, but I couldn't get any blood evidence off of it.
564	00:40:01	00:40:04	Even if we had that, we still don't have a blood standard for Travis.
565	00:40:04	00:40:06	I mean, we can't even positively ID the victim.
566	00:40:14	00:40:16	Miss Giles? Hi.
567	00:40:16	00:40:18	What can I do for you?
568	00:40:18	00:40:25	I wasn't able to find a hairbrush or a toothbrush, but the only thing I have left of Travis's is...
569	00:40:25	00:40:27	this.
570	00:40:30	00:40:34	When he was little, I used to be his tooth fairy.
571	00:40:37	00:40:41	DNA from Travis Giles' tooth matched the blood that we found in your house.
572	00:40:41	00:40:44	And now you're gonna tell us how it got there.
573	00:40:45	00:40:47	I don't know.
574	00:40:47	00:40:48	Kids get hurt all the time.
575	00:40:48	00:40:51	They fall down, cut themselves...
576	00:40:51	00:40:53	get nosebleeds.
577	00:40:53	00:40:54	Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
578	00:40:55	00:40:56	Wait a minute.
579	00:40:56	00:41:03	What are you telling me, that a kid that you've never seen, a kid who's not even friends with your son, got a nosebleed in your house?
580	00:41:03	00:41:05	Huh?
581	00:41:05	00:41:06	You're lying.
582	00:41:06	00:41:09	You know, we can make this quick, 'cause I got enough to arrest you right now.
583	00:41:09	00:41:10	Look, it was an accident.
584	00:41:11	00:41:16	All right, Travis came over one night, said he wanted to buy a knife.
585	00:41:16	00:41:18	So I gave him a knife.
586	00:41:18	00:41:20	He said he couldn't pay.
587	00:41:20	00:41:21	He tried to run.
588	00:41:25	00:41:28	Wasn't moving, he was just lying there, knife stuck in him.
589	00:41:28	00:41:30	Now you're lying.
590	00:41:31	00:41:33	Don't you call my son a liar.
591	00:41:33	00:41:35	Travis was stabbed twice.
592	00:41:35	00:41:37	That's not possible if he just fell on the knife.
593	00:41:37	00:41:38	So what happened?
594	00:41:38	00:41:40	He piss you off?
595	00:41:40	00:41:41	Get in a fight?
596	00:41:41	00:41:43	Maybe called you a mama's boy?
597	00:41:43	00:41:46	Or did you just want to see what it felt like to stab somebody?
598	00:41:46	00:41:47	Like I told you, it was an accident.
599	00:41:47	00:41:49	Then why did you dump the body down a sewer in the middle of the night?
600	00:41:49	00:41:51	He didn't.
601	00:41:51	00:41:52	He didn't do it alone.
602	00:41:53	00:41:55	We found the victim's charred clothing folded.
603	00:41:55	00:41:57	Kids don't fold anything, mothers do.
604	00:41:57	00:41:59	You helped him clean up the mess.
605	00:41:59	00:42:03	Yeah, that's kind of funny, because, um, you're not much of a housekeeper.
606	00:42:06	00:42:10	If you talk to my mother like that again, I'll kill you.
607	00:42:12	00:42:13	Don't you say another word, baby.
608	00:42:13	00:42:15	I'll kill both of you.
609	00:42:17	00:42:19	I want a lawyer.
610	00:42:19	00:42:22	Well, we really don't need a confession.
611	00:42:22	00:42:31	Well, the kid gets murder, mom's an accessory, and Dad gets felony explosives.
612	00:42:31	00:42:33	It's a family‐value pack.
613	00:42:33	00:42:35	Well, it's appropriate.
614	00:42:35	00:42:37	One way or another, they each had a hand in it.
615	00:42:37	00:42:39	Come on, Roger. Do we have to?
616	00:42:39	00:42:42	Just keep the camera on it, will ya?
617	00:42:43	00:42:45	Watch.
618	00:42:48	00:42:52	Violent environment, oblivious mother, disturbed child.
619	00:42:52	00:42:54	Here, stir this.
620	00:42:54	00:42:56	What's it for?
621	00:42:56	00:42:57	Blowing stuff up.
622	00:42:58	00:43:06	But you know, no matter how bad your kid turns out, it never changes how you feel about him.
623	00:43:07	00:43:14	Unconditional love between parents and offspring is biological, perpetuates the species.
624	00:43:16	00:43:19	Go ahead. That's good.
625	00:43:19	00:43:23	That's good. Get it good.
