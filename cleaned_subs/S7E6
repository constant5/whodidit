0	00:00:22	00:00:26	There's an Amber Alert this evening in Clark County for two missing boys.
1	00:00:27	00:00:33	Okay, we have two missing criticals-- Jason Crowley, age ten-- black, male, four-foot-six.
2	00:00:33	00:00:43	Lucas Hanson-- age ten, Caucasian, male, five feet. Now, uh, 30 hours-- Jason Crowley's house.
3	00:00:43	00:00:44	Jason lives with his grandfather, Terrance Crowley.
4	00:00:44	00:00:46	The address is on your handouts.
5	00:00:46	00:00:49	Terrance Crowley assumed that they were staying at Lucas' house.
6	00:00:49	00:00:54	Dawn Hanson, Lucas's mother, 00 hours.
7	00:00:54	00:00:57	She assumed they were at Terrance Crowley's house.
8	00:00:57	00:00:59	00 hours.
9	00:00:59	00:01:02	Now, we searched the schools, playgrounds, basketball courts.
10	00:01:02	00:01:04	Found nothing.
11	00:01:04	00:01:05	Canine is on the scene.
12	00:01:05	00:01:07	Neither of the boys carried cell phones or pagers.
13	00:01:08	00:01:09	Now, any questions?
14	00:01:09	00:01:14	Boys ever run away before? No, and, uh, we interviewed the teachers at the school, and according to them, they're both good kids.
15	00:01:15	00:01:17	Any, uh, distinguishing features or marks?
16	00:01:17	00:01:21	Well, as you can see, Jason wears glasses, but that's it. Yeah?
17	00:01:21	00:01:24	Did Amber Alerts go out to any other states?
18	00:01:24	00:01:26	Amber Alerts have gone out to the states of Utah, California...
19	00:01:31	00:01:35	Okay, so what does your arson have to do with my missing kids?
20	00:01:35	00:01:40	Upon initial search of the premises, farmer located one adult male unconscious on the living room floor.
21	00:01:40	00:01:41	His name's Carl Fisher.
22	00:01:41	00:01:43	Paramedics have him on the bumper now.
23	00:01:43	00:01:49	Once he came around, he started claiming every time there's an Amber Alert, somebody tries to kill him.
24	00:01:49	00:01:51	Child molester.
25	00:01:51	00:01:54	Tier Two, by his own admission.
26	00:02:00	00:02:03	Excuse me, Mr. Fisher? My name's Gil Grissom.
27	00:02:03	00:02:06	I'm with the Crime Lab.
28	00:02:06	00:02:08	What happened to your shoes?
29	00:02:08	00:02:09	They're in the house.
30	00:02:09	00:02:11	I was asleep.
31	00:02:11	00:02:15	Are you familiar with the names Lucas Hanson or Jason Crowley?
32	00:02:15	00:02:17	The kids from the Amber Alert?
33	00:02:17	00:02:18	No, sir.
34	00:02:18	00:02:20	I'm a convicted pedophile.
35	00:02:20	00:02:23	That would be a violation of my parole.
36	00:02:25	00:02:27	Which is it-- boys or girls?
37	00:02:27	00:02:29	Boys.
38	00:02:29	00:02:31	Preteen.
39	00:02:32	00:02:34	I know what you're thinking.
40	00:02:34	00:02:37	No, you don't.
41	00:03:12	00:03:14	Don't know what woke me up, the smoke or the fire.
42	00:03:16	00:03:20	Next thing I remember, I was outside, looking up at the paramedics.
43	00:03:20	00:03:22	Hold out your hands, please.
44	00:03:23	00:03:25	Turn them over.
45	00:03:27	00:03:29	So, uh, can you account for your whereabouts the last 24 hours?
46	00:03:29	00:03:35	00 until 2 and then I went straight home.
47	00:03:35	00:03:37	Where do you work?
48	00:03:37	00:03:38	At the feed lot off Highway 111.
49	00:03:38	00:03:40	I've got a Masters in English Literature.
50	00:03:40	00:03:41	I used to teach high school.
51	00:03:41	00:03:44	Let me guess-- the kids loved you.
52	00:03:44	00:03:46	Someone set fire to my house. I almost died.
53	00:03:46	00:03:49	Why don't you ask me about that? Okay.
54	00:03:49	00:03:50	Who would want to barbecue you?
55	00:03:50	00:03:54	My neighbors make it clear every day how they feel about me.
56	00:03:54	00:03:55	I would start with Mr. Hamilton.
57	00:03:55	00:04:00	He threw a rock through my window a few months back when a little girl went missing.
58	00:04:00	00:04:02	Hamilton... he barely finished high school.
59	00:04:02	00:04:05	He has a lot of displaced anger.
60	00:04:05	00:04:06	Hmm.
61	00:04:06	00:04:08	You're not writing any of this down.
62	00:04:08	00:04:10	I have a good memory.
63	00:04:10	00:04:14	Listen, I've called you guys half a dozen times in the past two years.
64	00:04:14	00:04:20	I've had my house graffitied, my windows broken, my tires slashed. Well, you know, Carl, sometimes bad things happen to bad people.
65	00:04:20	00:04:22	But I'll tell you what-- (cell phone chimes)
66	00:04:22	00:04:26	I'll let you file a formal complaint down at the police station.
67	00:04:29	00:04:31	I got to go. You all right here?
68	00:04:31	00:04:33	I'm almost done.
69	00:04:35	00:04:39	I've been living right the past five years since I got out of prison.
70	00:04:39	00:04:41	I haven't gone near a child.
71	00:04:41	00:04:43	I go to a support group every week.
72	00:04:43	00:04:46	I've even lectured social workers on how to recognize sexual predators.
73	00:04:47	00:04:48	Ask my parole officer.
74	00:04:48	00:04:50	Doesn't that count for something?
75	00:04:52	00:04:54	I don't know.
76	00:04:54	00:04:57	But it doesn't change anything, does it?
77	00:04:57	00:05:03	Police have no new clues in the disappearance of ten-year-old Lucas Hanson and 11-year-old Jason Crowley.
78	00:05:03	00:05:06	Teachers and classmates are planning a six p.m. vigil at Rockwater Elementary...
79	00:05:07	00:05:09	Mrs. Hanson, I got your message. You said it was urgent.
80	00:05:09	00:05:11	You told me to go home and look around.
81	00:05:11	00:05:13	That's what I did. My ex took 'em.
82	00:05:13	00:05:17	I thought you told me that your ex-husband wasn't involved in Lucas' life.
83	00:05:17	00:05:19	He doesn't care about Lucas.
84	00:05:19	00:05:24	He barely uses his visitation, and then, six months ago, I don't know, he-he got into some kind of trouble.
85	00:05:24	00:05:27	He started coming around when Lucas was home alone.
86	00:05:27	00:05:31	He'd gone through my mail, my checkbook.
87	00:05:31	00:05:34	He-He stole our TVs.
88	00:05:34	00:05:35	Daddy, please.
89	00:05:35	00:05:37	Mama said she's gonna call the cops.
90	00:05:37	00:05:38	Put it back.
91	00:05:38	00:05:40	Your mom can do whatever she wants.
92	00:05:40	00:05:43	I paid for this. It's mine.
93	00:05:44	00:05:51	So I told Lucas that he couldn't be home alone anymore, and I took his key.
94	00:05:51	00:05:53	You locked your son out of his own house?
95	00:05:53	00:05:56	I made arrangements with Jason's grandpa.
96	00:05:56	00:05:59	The hide-a-key is for emergencies only.
97	00:05:59	00:06:01	So it's possible that Lucas took the key.
98	00:06:01	00:06:03	Lucas...
99	00:06:03	00:06:10	Lucas always drops his book bag in the hallway and turns on the TV.
100	00:06:10	00:06:13	I bought him a new one.
101	00:06:13	00:06:15	I'm positive he didn't came home.
102	00:06:16	00:06:17	Okay, all right, all right.
103	00:06:18	00:06:20	Give me an address for your ex-husband.
104	00:06:22	00:06:25	225-IHG.
105	00:06:25	00:06:26	That sounds like a license plate.
106	00:06:26	00:06:29	Yeah, well, he moves around a lot.
107	00:06:30	00:06:31	Practically lives out of his car.
108	00:06:31	00:06:35	He... He runs a stripper circuit on I-15.
109	00:06:36	00:06:39	Have you ever seen this man?
110	00:06:39	00:06:41	No. Why?
111	00:06:41	00:06:43	Uh, he's a person of interest.
112	00:06:43	00:06:45	Lucas knows better than that.
113	00:06:45	00:06:47	You don't talk to strangers.
114	00:06:47	00:06:49	Ah, it's okay. Uh, yeah.
115	00:06:49	00:06:51	Put out a broadcast on Perry Hanson.
116	00:06:51	00:06:56	Look, Jason and Lucas probably just ran away.
117	00:06:56	00:06:57	They're at that age.
118	00:06:57	00:06:59	You know what I'm saying?
119	00:06:59	00:07:03	Well, kids with no money and no place to go usually come home quickly.
120	00:07:03	00:07:05	Do you know how hard it would be to catch them?
121	00:07:05	00:07:07	Lucas is a big boy.
122	00:07:07	00:07:08	And Jason...
123	00:07:08	00:07:09	Jason is fast.
124	00:07:09	00:07:11	The red one is Jason's.
125	00:07:11	00:07:14	Your grandson's into sports, huh?
126	00:07:14	00:07:15	Yeah, you'd think.
127	00:07:15	00:07:17	Plays them damn video games.
128	00:07:17	00:07:18	That's all he wants to do.
129	00:07:18	00:07:21	I told him I don't allow that stuff in my house.
130	00:07:21	00:07:23	Boys need fresh air and sunshine.
131	00:07:23	00:07:26	Uh, we haven't been able to reach Jason's father.
132	00:07:26	00:07:28	Have you spoken to him?
133	00:07:28	00:07:32	You know, my son fell apart when his wife died.
134	00:07:32	00:07:34	Quit his job.
135	00:07:34	00:07:36	I was basically taking care of both of them.
136	00:07:36	00:07:39	And then he got a great opportunity in Houston.
137	00:07:39	00:07:43	Couldn't get Jason into a school until next semester, so I said I'd keep him until then.
138	00:07:46	00:07:48	How do those dogs find people?
139	00:07:49	00:07:52	Just like the movies, they sniff them out.
140	00:07:53	00:07:55	Bet it's expensive, huh?
141	00:07:55	00:07:56	You worried about the money?
142	00:07:56	00:07:58	Let me tell you something.
143	00:07:58	00:08:01	Boys are gonna walk right in here just like that runaway bride.
144	00:08:01	00:08:06	And you people are gonna be handing me a bill for all the looking, you watch.
145	00:08:14	00:08:16	Hey.
146	00:08:16	00:08:17	Hey.
147	00:08:17	00:08:18	I talked with the neighbors.
148	00:08:18	00:08:22	00 last night.
149	00:08:22	00:08:24	She saw Carl watering his outside plants.
150	00:08:24	00:08:25	He was alone.
151	00:08:25	00:08:29	She also said that after dark, everyone locks up their doors, and the kids stay inside.
152	00:08:30	00:08:31	And let me guess.
153	00:08:31	00:08:33	Nobody saw or heard anything, right?
154	00:08:33	00:08:35	Right. Right.
155	00:08:35	00:08:36	What do you got?
156	00:08:36	00:08:40	Based on the burn pattern, the origin of the fire was definitely here.
157	00:08:40	00:08:45	I detected an accelerant on the front of the car, and on the ground, both consistent with gasoline.
158	00:08:45	00:08:51	Now, the back seat's still intact, so I figure the fire jumped from the car to the house and fast.
159	00:08:57	00:08:59	Check this out.
160	00:09:02	00:09:05	Full shoe impression on the concrete.
161	00:09:05	00:09:08	Someone stepped in the accelerant before the car was lit.
162	00:09:15	00:09:18	Treads lead toward the street.
163	00:09:18	00:09:19	Could've been a neighbor.
164	00:09:19	00:09:20	Could've been anybody.
165	00:09:47	00:09:51	Well, so far, the only prints I found in the bedroom are Carl Fisher's.
166	00:09:51	00:09:52	No semen stains in the bed.
167	00:09:52	00:09:55	And nothing to indicate children.
168	00:09:55	00:09:57	Well, there's tons of these.
169	00:09:57	00:09:59	What's that?
170	00:09:59	00:10:03	Spencer's Last Straw, Wiz Kids, Mayhem and McCabe, Secret City.
171	00:10:03	00:10:05	Guy lives in a trailer.
172	00:10:05	00:10:06	He drives an old Mercury.
173	00:10:06	00:10:10	He has a ton of expensive DVDs and video games.
174	00:10:10	00:10:13	There's gummi bears and chips on the floor.
175	00:10:13	00:10:16	House might as well be made out of gingerbread.
176	00:10:20	00:10:22	Vehicle matched the description.
177	00:10:22	00:10:25	Went to pull him over, he tried to split on us.
178	00:10:26	00:10:27	Perry Hanson?
179	00:10:27	00:10:30	So, Mr. Hanson, where are the boys?
180	00:10:30	00:10:32	Which boys?
181	00:10:32	00:10:33	Lucas and Jason.
182	00:10:33	00:10:35	My kid, Lucas?
183	00:10:35	00:10:37	What, did he ditch school or something?
184	00:10:37	00:10:39	No, he's missing, and so is his best friend.
185	00:10:39	00:10:41	You mean, you didn't hear the Amber Alert, or check your messages?
186	00:10:41	00:10:43	You don't have to talk to him, okay, Perry?
187	00:10:43	00:10:44	See, I know the frickin' Constitution.
188	00:10:44	00:10:46	I bet you do.
189	00:10:46	00:10:48	Somebody get Ben Franklin out of here.
190	00:10:48	00:10:50	Don't...
191	00:10:50	00:10:52	You didn't have to cuff us, you know?
192	00:10:52	00:10:53	It's not like we're frickin' terrorists.
193	00:11:20	00:11:24	You want to tell me what Jason Crowley's baseball glove is doing in your car?
194	00:11:25	00:11:28	Lucas must've left it there.
195	00:11:28	00:11:32	I don't know, man, kids are always taking each other's crap. Yeah, well, I'm not taking any more of yours. You're under arrest.
196	00:11:38	00:11:40	Got something here.
197	00:11:41	00:11:44	Lucas was last seen wearing khaki-colored board shorts.
198	00:11:44	00:11:46	I've had calls here before.
199	00:11:46	00:11:47	A lot of these houses are vacant.
200	00:11:47	00:11:50	Perfect place for a little privacy.
201	00:11:51	00:11:52	Okay, let's get around this fence.
202	00:11:54	00:11:55	Okay, let's hear it.
203	00:11:55	00:11:57	You know my ex is crazy, right?
204	00:11:57	00:11:59	Always been a drama queen.
205	00:11:59	00:12:02	She probably told you that I stole the TV.
206	00:12:02	00:12:03	I don't care about the TV.
207	00:12:03	00:12:05	When was the last time you were in your house?
208	00:12:05	00:12:08	Day I left-- I've never been back.
209	00:12:09	00:12:11	I found this in your car.
210	00:12:11	00:12:14	Guess whose front door it opens?
211	00:12:16	00:12:18	Look...
212	00:12:18	00:12:20	my ex will hardly even let me see my kid.
213	00:12:20	00:12:24	You know, not until I pay up on the vaginamony that I owe.
214	00:12:24	00:12:26	And that's illegal. She doesn't care.
215	00:12:26	00:12:29	Yesterday, I-I just wanted to see my boy.
216	00:12:29	00:12:32	You know? So I went over there and he wasn't home.
217	00:12:32	00:12:34	I guess I forgot to leave the key.
218	00:12:34	00:12:36	Another sad, suffering single dad.
219	00:12:36	00:12:38	You better find my kid.
220	00:12:38	00:12:41	And if I were you, I'd start with Dawn's boyfriends.
221	00:12:41	00:12:42	Oh, if you were me.
222	00:12:42	00:12:44	She only dates scumbags and bottom-feeders.
223	00:12:44	00:12:47	At least I never been in prison. Well, that can change.
224	00:12:49	00:12:50	LVPD.
225	00:12:52	00:12:54	Kitchen's clear.
226	00:12:58	00:13:00	Clear!
227	00:13:13	00:13:16	Closet's clear.
228	00:13:16	00:13:17	Check the rest of the house.
229	00:13:29	00:13:31	It's the door itself, not what's inside.
230	00:13:34	00:13:36	There was a struggle here. I've got blood...
231	00:13:36	00:13:39	and short dark hairs caught in the wood.
232	00:13:39	00:13:40	Could be Jason's.
233	00:13:42	00:13:43	We've got tags.
234	00:13:47	00:13:49	Blood smear.
235	00:13:49	00:13:50	That's far enough away from the door.
236	00:13:50	00:13:53	It's possibly a separate event.
237	00:13:56	00:13:58	Toys and candy.
238	00:13:58	00:14:00	Somebody's kids were playing here.
239	00:14:05	00:14:07	Sofia...
240	00:14:07	00:14:11	A dental bridge.
241	00:14:11	00:14:13	Two premolars.
242	00:14:16	00:14:18	Grandpa lied through his teeth.
243	00:14:25	00:14:27	Recognize these?
244	00:14:27	00:14:31	You brought me way down here to show me a picture of my teeth?
245	00:14:31	00:14:33	Huh?
246	00:14:33	00:14:35	The least you could do is give 'em back.
247	00:14:35	00:14:37	Remember those dogs...
248	00:14:38	00:14:39	you were so interested in?
249	00:14:39	00:14:45	Well, they led us to an abandoned house, not far from where you live, and that's where we found your teeth.
250	00:14:45	00:14:54	We also found physical evidence-- blood evidence-- that tells us that your grandson and Lucas-- You think you're real smart, lady.
251	00:14:54	00:14:56	Don't you?
252	00:14:58	00:15:02	Before I start thinking you killed those boys, why don't you tell me what happened.
253	00:15:02	00:15:03	I was defending myself.
254	00:15:03	00:15:06	Against a pair of sixth graders?
255	00:15:06	00:15:07	You're damn right.
256	00:15:07	00:15:09	Two boys can cause a lot of damages.
257	00:15:09	00:15:11	Especially that Lucas.
258	00:15:12	00:15:13	Hey, hey, hey!
259	00:15:13	00:15:17	00, now it's cold-- let's go!
260	00:15:17	00:15:19	We don't want your food. We're going to eat at my house.
261	00:15:19	00:15:21	My dad said I could stay with Lucas and his mom.
262	00:15:21	00:15:22	I like it better there.
263	00:15:22	00:15:24	Don't you lie to me, boy.
264	00:15:24	00:15:25	I'm not lying.
265	00:15:26	00:15:28	I wish you weren't my grandpa.
266	00:15:28	00:15:31	Don't talk to me like that again.
267	00:15:35	00:15:37	They had it coming.
268	00:15:37	00:15:40	Those boys have no respect.
269	00:15:40	00:15:42	They're punks.
270	00:15:43	00:15:46	Now, I love my son, but he didn't do right by Jason.
271	00:15:46	00:15:48	So you thought you'd beat respect into him.
272	00:15:48	00:15:52	I don't need a lecture about how to discipline my grandson.
273	00:15:52	00:15:57	That's the trouble with parents today, they're afraid of their own kids.
274	00:15:57	00:15:58	Sounds like they were afraid of you.
275	00:15:58	00:16:00	That's the way it's supposed to be.
276	00:16:00	00:16:02	What happened after the altercation?
277	00:16:02	00:16:03	They ran off.
278	00:16:03	00:16:06	You don't want to eat, you go hungry.
279	00:16:06	00:16:08	That's how you learn.
280	00:16:08	00:16:09	Why didn't you tell us this before?
281	00:16:09	00:16:12	I told you what was important, lady.
282	00:16:14	00:16:16	Now those boys are going to be fine.
283	00:16:17	00:16:20	What they're trying to do, they're trying to punish me.
284	00:16:20	00:16:21	That's what they're trying to do.
285	00:16:21	00:16:23	And you'll see, they'll be back.
286	00:16:23	00:16:26	And then I will sit down and I will talk to Jason.
287	00:16:26	00:16:28	Now, what about my teeth?
288	00:16:28	00:16:29	They're evidence.
289	00:16:29	00:16:31	We'll give them back to you when we're done.
290	00:16:31	00:16:34	It was self-defense and you can't charge me.
291	00:16:35	00:16:37	Okay, I'll let you go.
292	00:16:37	00:16:39	Until we find the boys.
293	00:16:41	00:16:42	Well, how am I supposed to get home?
294	00:16:42	00:16:44	You took my car, too.
295	00:16:44	00:16:47	There's a bus stop down the street.
296	00:16:54	00:16:55	Where is he? What did you do?
297	00:16:55	00:16:57	You better watch your tone.
298	00:16:57	00:17:00	You swore you wouldn't lay a hand on him. You better get out of my face boy.
299	00:17:00	00:17:01	Are you Gerald Crowley?
300	00:17:02	00:17:03	Jason's dad? Yes, ma'am.
301	00:17:03	00:17:05	Did you know this man is a bully?
302	00:17:05	00:17:09	Big college football coach until he got caught abusing his own players.
303	00:17:09	00:17:12	Almost got thrown in jail.
304	00:17:12	00:17:14	You just had to take care of him for a few months.
305	00:17:14	00:17:17	What the hell is wrong with you? Okay, let's go talk some place.
306	00:17:17	00:17:20	I swear...
307	00:17:20	00:17:21	If you hurt Jason...
308	00:17:22	00:17:24	I will kill you.
309	00:18:31	00:18:33	It's a gas container. Yeah.
310	00:18:33	00:18:35	I found it melted to the floorboard.
311	00:18:42	00:18:43	People are so predictable.
312	00:18:44	00:18:46	Lucky for us.
313	00:18:46	00:18:54	You want me to go to the station, and repeat all the facts I already told you. If you want to file a formal complaint to make it official, yes.
314	00:18:54	00:18:56	Oh, is that a Red Cross voucher?
315	00:18:56	00:18:58	I'll call and make a hotel reservation for you.
316	00:18:59	00:19:00	I got to go to the bathroom.
317	00:19:00	00:19:02	You want me to leave the door open?
318	00:19:02	00:19:03	I'm too old for you.
319	00:19:04	00:19:06	Grissom.
320	00:19:06	00:19:07	Yeah, Gil, yeah.
321	00:19:07	00:19:09	He's agreed to come to the PD.
322	00:19:09	00:19:14	But I can't keep him there long, so let's ratchet it up a notch and get something to hold him on, all right?
323	00:19:24	00:19:27	Carl Fisher's on his way in to the station to sign off on his arson claim.
324	00:19:27	00:19:29	Brass needs something from us to hold him.
325	00:19:29	00:19:34	Yeah, if he's got those kids stashed somewhere, he could try to take them out of state. Or worse.
326	00:19:37	00:19:38	I wish I had more.
327	00:19:38	00:19:40	The burned shoe impression was a size 11.
328	00:19:40	00:19:42	Carl Fisher wears a size 11.
329	00:19:42	00:19:43	But none of the patterns match up.
330	00:19:43	00:19:47	And the shoes that Sara found near the sofa...
331	00:19:47	00:19:50	I can't even identify a brand.
332	00:19:50	00:19:52	Sorry.
333	00:20:02	00:20:04	Didn't we talk about this once before, Greg?
334	00:20:04	00:20:08	I'm the one who turned the music on.
335	00:20:12	00:20:13	What have you found?
336	00:20:13	00:20:15	A gas container.
337	00:20:15	00:20:20	As the heat melted the plastic, it formed pockets, trapping the gasoline inside.
338	00:20:22	00:20:29	And if Hodges can isolate any unique compounds from the gas, you know, like, gas DNA.
339	00:20:29	00:20:32	Gasoline comparisons are only credible if you have pure samples.
340	00:20:32	00:20:33	Otherwise, there's too many variables.
341	00:20:34	00:20:35	I know that, Grissom.
342	00:20:35	00:20:40	What I've extracted was never exposed directly to the fire.
343	00:20:40	00:20:51	So, if we can identify either a dye, or a unique compound, and match it to a particular station, then we might be able to prove whether Carl set the fire.
344	00:20:53	00:20:55	I'll get this to Hodges.
345	00:20:55	00:20:59	Greg's got the Coroner's Inquest coming up.
346	00:20:59	00:21:01	He's been under a lot of stress.
347	00:21:01	00:21:05	Maybe you could be a little nicer to him.
348	00:21:05	00:21:06	I just want to find these boys.
349	00:21:07	00:21:08	Okay.
350	00:21:08	00:21:11	Carl Fisher, apparently...
351	00:21:12	00:21:16	...eats and drinks in the backseat of his car.
352	00:21:16	00:21:18	I found it in a seat pocket.
353	00:21:18	00:21:19	Fruit punch?
354	00:21:19	00:21:20	Or a mixer.
355	00:21:22	00:21:26	Whiskey-- I did not find the bottle.
356	00:21:26	00:21:28	And... so?
357	00:21:30	00:21:34	Mushrooms, picked off a cheese pizza.
358	00:21:34	00:21:37	I found it stuffed between the cushions in the backseat of the car.
359	00:21:37	00:21:42	If you're an adult, and you don't like mushrooms, you don't order them.
360	00:21:44	00:21:48	Oh, did I tell you, you can't check into the hotel 00.
361	00:21:48	00:21:50	I'll find something to do.
362	00:21:50	00:21:53	Well, I'm wondering if you might hang out and volunteer your services here.
363	00:21:53	00:21:54	Isn't that what you do?
364	00:21:54	00:21:57	Talk to groups about sexual deviancy?
365	00:21:57	00:21:59	You want me to help you do your job?
366	00:21:59	00:22:01	Help you find those missing kids?
367	00:22:01	00:22:03	Yeah, that's what I want.
368	00:22:03	00:22:05	So you going to help us out or what?
369	00:22:05	00:22:09	I may be able to offer some insights.
370	00:22:10	00:22:13	But only if I can talk to the other guy.
371	00:22:14	00:22:17	I'm a victim of abuse.
372	00:22:17	00:22:18	My older brother.
373	00:22:18	00:22:22	I was eight.
374	00:22:22	00:22:24	He was much older-- 16.
375	00:22:24	00:22:26	He was jealous and angry.
376	00:22:26	00:22:27	He wanted to destroy me.
377	00:22:27	00:22:34	It's not offered as an excuse, but it might explain why I'm here with you right now.
378	00:22:41	00:22:47	These are known child molesters living within our search radius.
379	00:22:51	00:22:53	I met him in prison.
380	00:22:54	00:22:56	He's an environmental offender.
381	00:22:56	00:22:57	Situational.
382	00:22:57	00:23:00	Only molests members of his own family.
383	00:23:00	00:23:02	Small world-- he's in my support group.
384	00:23:03	00:23:05	Your boys are too ripe for him.
385	00:23:05	00:23:07	He likes toddlers.
386	00:23:10	00:23:14	A couple of these guys are mysopeds-- aggressive pedophiles.
387	00:23:15	00:23:17	Some of their pleasures derive from physical violence.
388	00:23:18	00:23:23	They like to molest, then beat, and sometimes kill their victims.
389	00:23:23	00:23:25	But these guys aren't killers.
390	00:23:26	00:23:28	Who said the boys were dead?
391	00:23:28	00:23:30	They've been gone a long time.
392	00:23:44	00:23:46	Bad news?
393	00:23:52	00:23:54	Sir, you're gonna have to stand back.
394	00:23:54	00:23:56	You're gonna have to stand back, ma'am.
395	00:24:27	00:24:30	There's a scrape on his left cheek.
396	00:24:30	00:24:34	Yeah, there's some minor bruising on the knuckles of his right hand.
397	00:24:34	00:24:37	Probably a defensive wound.
398	00:24:40	00:24:44	Catherine found some brown fabric on a fence nearby.
399	00:24:45	00:24:46	I bet it's from these shorts.
400	00:24:51	00:24:57	Hey, super, you didn't leave this shirt inside out when you took it off the body, did you? No.
401	00:24:57	00:24:58	Could be a redress.
402	00:24:59	00:25:02	Yeah. Yeah, it could.
403	00:25:02	00:25:03	Okay...
404	00:25:03	00:25:08	Well, SAE kit should tell us whether or not he was molested.
405	00:25:10	00:25:11	Sometimes this job gets to me.
406	00:25:11	00:25:12	Yeah, me, too, buddy.
407	00:25:14	00:25:16	Me, too.
408	00:25:18	00:25:19	Grandpa play golf?
409	00:25:19	00:25:21	I think golf's a little too rich for his blood.
410	00:25:21	00:25:24	Doesn't mean he didn't follow them here.
411	00:25:24	00:25:27	A killer wouldn't take time to bury him that way, it was too nice.
412	00:25:27	00:25:31	It suggests whoever killed him cared about him, knew him, you know?
413	00:25:31	00:25:33	Well, my money's still on the pedophile.
414	00:25:35	00:25:36	A ten-year old could fit in there, huh?
415	00:25:36	00:25:38	Jason's a skinny kid.
416	00:25:45	00:25:49	I didn't see this boy at the pizza place, but I remember the little guy.
417	00:25:49	00:25:50	He had a fat lip.
418	00:25:50	00:25:52	I asked him where he got it.
419	00:25:52	00:25:55	What did he tell you? He said his grandfather was a bully.
420	00:25:55	00:25:58	I started to walk out with him and I was worried.
421	00:25:58	00:26:00	But he swore he was safe.
422	00:26:00	00:26:03	With friends. Did you see who he was with?
423	00:26:03	00:26:05	Some white guy.
424	00:26:05	00:26:06	It was pretty dark.
425	00:26:06	00:26:08	And there was no one else with him?
426	00:26:08	00:26:09	Not that I saw.
427	00:26:09	00:26:14	But they ordered an extra-large with everything-- and that's 18 slices-- and a full liter of cherry soda.
428	00:26:15	00:26:18	If it matters, they sat in the parking lot for a while.
429	00:26:18	00:26:20	Is there anything you can remember about the car?
430	00:26:20	00:26:21	Make? Color?
431	00:26:21	00:26:22	It was a Mercury Marquis.
432	00:26:22	00:26:24	Are you positive? Yeah.
433	00:26:24	00:26:26	My boyfriend's a street...
434	00:26:26	00:26:28	uh, he's into cars, so...
435	00:26:28	00:26:30	I know cars.
436	00:26:31	00:26:33	No sand in his nasal passages or lungs.
437	00:26:33	00:26:35	He was dead before he was buried.
438	00:26:37	00:26:39	Are those palm prints on his sternum?
439	00:26:40	00:26:43	Consistent in position and pressure with CPR.
440	00:26:43	00:26:44	Also found air in his stomach.
441	00:26:44	00:26:47	If you don't tilt the head back, the trachea doesn't open.
442	00:26:47	00:26:51	It forces air into the stomach instead of the lungs and that's bad CPR.
443	00:26:51	00:26:55	Now, what kind of a killer performs CPR on their victim?
444	00:26:55	00:26:57	Well, maybe he didn't mean to kill him.
445	00:26:57	00:27:00	His pupils were dilated.
446	00:27:00	00:27:03	I found a subdural hematoma in the left frontal lobe.
447	00:27:03	00:27:05	That's your preliminary cause of death.
448	00:27:05	00:27:07	I sent samples to Tox, of course.
449	00:27:07	00:27:11	Catherine found blood smear on the floor where he was playing.
450	00:27:11	00:27:14	He has a laceration on his cheek.
451	00:27:14	00:27:23	And the grandpa admits he pushed Lucas down when he hit his head. Except that, by itself, the head injury wouldn't have been immediately fatal or necessarily incapacitating.
452	00:27:23	00:27:26	But, yeah, he would've had a headache.
453	00:27:29	00:27:32	Hey, got some gasoline samples for you.
454	00:27:32	00:27:34	Thanks, Greg. It's gonna take a little while to fill my tank.
455	00:27:34	00:27:35	Why don't I get you a funnel?
456	00:27:35	00:27:37	Kidding.
457	00:27:37	00:27:39	You think your arson case has something to do with these missing kids?
458	00:27:39	00:27:43	Well, Carl Fisher lives in the neighborhood, but, so far, his alibi checks out.
459	00:27:43	00:27:47	I don't know why pedophiles just don't kill themselves.
460	00:27:47	00:27:49	Who knows, he might have tried.
461	00:27:49	00:27:52	I collected these from service stations closest to his house.
462	00:27:52	00:27:53	Did you consider...
463	00:27:53	00:27:56	That he might have filled up on his way to work or anywhere else in Vegas?
464	00:27:56	00:28:02	Yes-- that's why I wanted to get you started on these before I hit the other stations on the list.
465	00:28:02	00:28:04	Good job, gas-hopper.
466	00:28:09	00:28:11	Okay, then...
467	00:28:12	00:28:18	...what would you do if you were going to take those boys?
468	00:28:18	00:28:20	I would be studying them.
469	00:28:20	00:28:23	Do they like sports? Comic books?
470	00:28:23	00:28:26	Do they skip school? Have any friends?
471	00:28:26	00:28:28	Good parents, or are they neglected?
472	00:28:28	00:28:29	Unhappy? Angry?
473	00:28:30	00:28:31	And then?
474	00:28:31	00:28:33	What do you do when you like a woman?
475	00:28:34	00:28:36	It's a game of seduction.
476	00:28:36	00:28:39	Once you know what they like, you make contact.
477	00:28:39	00:28:41	You start slowly, play it cool.
478	00:28:41	00:28:43	Especially with boys.
479	00:28:43	00:28:46	It's about building trust.
480	00:28:47	00:28:49	Like you're doing with me.
481	00:28:50	00:28:52	Do you like mushrooms, Carl?
482	00:28:52	00:28:54	I like all the nightshade vegetables.
483	00:28:54	00:28:56	Are you going to buy me dinner?
484	00:28:59	00:29:01	We found mushrooms in the backseat of your car.
485	00:29:01	00:29:03	Is this turning into an interrogation?
486	00:29:06	00:29:08	You're free to leave.
487	00:29:11	00:29:17	On the night the boys disappeared, witnesses said they saw them sitting in a car with a man, eating pizza.
488	00:29:17	00:29:21	You take a date out to a nice steak dinner.
489	00:29:21	00:29:24	Kids would rather have hamburgers or pizza.
490	00:29:24	00:29:27	Did you take the kids out for pizza?
491	00:29:27	00:29:30	No, I'm talking hypothetically.
492	00:29:30	00:29:33	You must be desperate for a suspect, or a scapegoat.
493	00:29:34	00:29:37	Do you need to give the press something to chew on?
494	00:29:37	00:29:39	We just found Lucas Hanson's dead body.
495	00:29:39	00:29:41	They're chewing on that.
496	00:29:44	00:29:46	What about the other boy?
497	00:29:46	00:29:48	He's still missing.
498	00:29:48	00:29:52	In my opinion, if someone killed one boy...
499	00:29:53	00:29:55	...he'd kill them both.
500	00:30:05	00:30:08	So, we're working on a couple of Jason sightings.
501	00:30:09	00:30:13	Camper in Red Rock spotted a kid that looks like Jason, so I sent Vega.
502	00:30:13	00:30:16	And Sofia is on her way to Bullhead City, Arizona.
503	00:30:16	00:30:18	A woman on a bus called the cops.
504	00:30:18	00:30:20	She swears that Jason's sitting next to her.
505	00:30:20	00:30:22	That's what I've got.
506	00:30:22	00:30:24	Any luck with Carl Fisher?
507	00:30:24	00:30:25	I don't know.
508	00:30:25	00:30:27	He wants something from me...
509	00:30:27	00:30:29	or he wouldn't still be here.
510	00:31:39	00:31:40	Sanders?
511	00:31:40	00:31:41	You can stop gassing up.
512	00:31:41	00:31:43	I've got a match.
513	00:31:43	00:31:46	AvCon on Buffalo Canyon. Pump six.
514	00:31:49	00:31:51	Where did he board?
515	00:31:51	00:31:52	Vegas depot.
516	00:31:52	00:31:54	Was he with anyone?
517	00:31:55	00:31:56	I'm not gonna report you.
518	00:31:56	00:31:58	You can tell me the truth.
519	00:31:58	00:32:02	Children aren't supposed to travel alone, but it was a full bus when I took off today.
520	00:32:02	00:32:03	I couldn't tell you.
521	00:32:03	00:32:05	He was definitely by himself.
522	00:32:05	00:32:07	I saw this, I knew it was him.
523	00:32:07	00:32:08	I radioed my dispatcher.
524	00:32:08	00:32:13	She told me to pullover at the next town, make sure he doesn't get off, and wait for you.
525	00:32:13	00:32:14	Thank you for your help.
526	00:32:14	00:32:17	Can you tell me where he's sitting? Back row.
527	00:32:32	00:32:34	Hey.
528	00:32:36	00:32:38	My name's Sofia. Are you Jason?
529	00:32:41	00:32:43	There's nothing to be afraid of, Jason.
530	00:32:43	00:32:46	You're not in trouble. I just want to help you.
531	00:32:46	00:32:49	You're on your way to Texas to see your dad, right?
532	00:32:51	00:32:53	It's just...
533	00:32:53	00:32:58	well, went you went missing, your dad flew to Las Vegas to find you.
534	00:32:58	00:33:00	He's waiting for you.
535	00:33:00	00:33:02	Can I take you to him?
536	00:33:09	00:33:11	Is that the tox report for Lucas Hanson?
537	00:33:11	00:33:13	His blood alcohol-- point one six.
538	00:33:13	00:33:16	Geez. It's a drunk kid.
539	00:33:16	00:33:18	And Sara found a whiskey cap in Carl Fisher's car.
540	00:33:19	00:33:23	Oh, perfect way to loosen up a little boy-- give him pizza and whiskey.
541	00:33:24	00:33:25	Yeah, well, listen to this.
542	00:33:25	00:33:33	According to the report, Lucas also had 98 micrograms per milliliter of salicylates in his system. Well, I guess he took the aspirin after he hit his head.
543	00:33:33	00:33:35	Wonder who gave him that.
544	00:33:35	00:33:39	Probably the same responsible adult that gave him the whiskey.
545	00:33:42	00:33:48	So, you think I got the boys drunk, and then killed them?
546	00:33:48	00:33:50	Not exactly.
547	00:33:50	00:33:53	We found Jason Crowley.
548	00:33:53	00:33:54	Alive.
549	00:33:54	00:33:57	On a bus headed for Houston.
550	00:33:57	00:34:00	One of the lucky ones.
551	00:34:10	00:34:13	It's okay, Jason.
552	00:34:13	00:34:15	Daddy's here, boy. Daddy's here.
553	00:34:20	00:34:23	That bus ticket costs $95 for a child under 12.
554	00:34:23	00:34:31	Jason's grandfather doesn't keep any cash in the house, and he doesn't give him an allowance, so where do you think Jason got the cash?
555	00:34:31	00:34:33	Maybe he stole it.
556	00:34:33	00:34:36	From whom? I don't know.
557	00:34:36	00:34:38	Why don't you ask him?
558	00:34:38	00:34:40	I will.
559	00:34:43	00:34:46	Do you get a lot of migraines, Gil?
560	00:34:49	00:34:52	You should ask your doctor for a prescription of sumatriptan.
561	00:34:52	00:34:54	Works for me.
562	00:34:58	00:35:01	Captain Brass wants to put you in a lineup.
563	00:35:01	00:35:05	If you'll agree to it, then I think this will all be over with.
564	00:35:05	00:35:08	Then let's do it.
565	00:35:10	00:35:13	Do you recognize anyone, Jason?
566	00:35:15	00:35:17	Which number?
567	00:35:23	00:35:25	Number two?
568	00:35:25	00:35:27	Yes.
569	00:35:27	00:35:30	Was he the man who kidnapped you and Lucas?
570	00:35:33	00:35:38	Jason, remember, you can see him, but he can't see you.
571	00:35:38	00:35:41	Did number two hurt Lucas?
572	00:35:41	00:35:44	I'll kill your dad if you tell...
573	00:35:44	00:35:46	No, ma'am.
574	00:36:00	00:36:03	The gas DNA panned out.
575	00:36:03	00:36:05	It did?
576	00:36:05	00:36:10	Yeah. Hodges and I traced the gas back to a service station near Fisher's house.
577	00:36:10	00:36:11	Station had security cameras.
578	00:36:11	00:36:15	Got him filling up the night of the fire, so I went through the electronic receipts.
579	00:36:15	00:36:16	All of them.
580	00:36:16	00:36:19	Carl Fisher purchased 16 gallons.
581	00:36:19	00:36:20	And?
582	00:36:20	00:36:26	His Mercury Marquis only holds 14, so, where did he put the extra two gallons?
583	00:36:26	00:36:28	In a plastic gas can?
584	00:36:28	00:36:31	All of which he paid for with his ATM.
585	00:36:31	00:36:32	Not the same as cash.
586	00:36:32	00:36:35	Thanks, Greg.
587	00:36:38	00:36:42	No one has told me why I'm being detained.
588	00:36:42	00:36:43	Arson is a felony.
589	00:36:43	00:36:45	You torched your own car.
590	00:36:45	00:36:53	We have video surveillance and electronic records that show you purchasing gas and a gas can.
591	00:36:53	00:36:55	I was trying to scam my insurance company.
592	00:36:55	00:36:56	I needed the money.
593	00:36:56	00:37:00	You were destroying evidence of Lucas Hanson and Jason Crowley in your car.
594	00:37:02	00:37:04	And I think you helped kill Lucas.
595	00:37:04	00:37:06	No, I didn't.
596	00:37:06	00:37:13	And you're not charging me for that, so I'm guessing Jason didn't pick me out of the lineup.
597	00:37:13	00:37:15	He told us he knew you.
598	00:37:15	00:37:19	Kill one, kill both, remember?
599	00:37:22	00:37:27	If I had killed Lucas, I would have killed Jason.
600	00:37:31	00:37:34	Lucas was looking for a father.
601	00:37:34	00:37:37	His real one was an accident of biology.
602	00:37:37	00:37:39	His mother was limited, always working.
603	00:37:39	00:37:42	He was lonely.
604	00:37:43	00:37:44	He found me.
605	00:37:44	00:37:48	I see you every day.
606	00:37:48	00:37:52	You play a lot, huh?
607	00:37:52	00:37:53	Maybe we can play sometime.
608	00:37:55	00:37:57	My best friend's always grounded.
609	00:37:57	00:37:58	How about tomorrow?
610	00:38:02	00:38:08	Did you know that most parents spend less than 20 minutes a day of quality time with their kids?
611	00:38:08	00:38:10	Lucas was starved for attention.
612	00:38:10	00:38:14	All his mother did was complain about his father and how he'd abandoned them.
613	00:38:15	00:38:17	Do you know what that does to a child?
614	00:38:17	00:38:19	It doesn't kill them.
615	00:38:21	00:38:25	Okay, Carl, just tell me what happened.
616	00:38:27	00:38:31	Lucas and Jason had gotten into it with Jason's grandfather.
617	00:38:31	00:38:33	He knocked the boys around.
618	00:38:33	00:38:38	They ran to Lucas' house, but couldn't get in, so they came to me.
619	00:38:44	00:38:46	I explained to them that hitting wasn't okay.
620	00:38:46	00:38:50	I said Jason needed to call his father and tell him what was going on.
621	00:38:50	00:38:52	Did you let them use your phone?
622	00:38:52	00:38:53	But they were too upset.
623	00:38:53	00:38:57	When the grandfather pushed Lucas, he hit his head.
624	00:38:57	00:38:59	I gave him a couple of aspirin.
625	00:38:59	00:39:02	Well, if he didn't want to call his mother, why didn't you call her?
626	00:39:02	00:39:03	I couldn't risk it.
627	00:39:03	00:39:05	She might have turned me in.
628	00:39:05	00:39:07	So, instead, you took them for pizza?
629	00:39:07	00:39:10	I didn't touch him.
630	00:39:10	00:39:12	I didn't want to hurt him.
631	00:39:12	00:39:13	You gave him liquor.
632	00:39:13	00:39:18	I stopped and bought some whiskey before we picked up the pizza-- I was nervous about them being in the car with me.
633	00:39:18	00:39:20	I didn't want to go back to prison.
634	00:39:20	00:39:21	And you wanted to get them drunk.
635	00:39:23	00:39:26	They... They just wanted to try it.
636	00:39:26	00:39:28	I gave them a taste.
637	00:39:29	00:39:32	It was more than a taste, Carl.
638	00:39:32	00:39:34	Lucas' blood alcohol level was point one six.
639	00:39:34	00:39:36	That's twice the legal limit for an adult.
640	00:39:38	00:39:40	Why didn't you take them home?
641	00:39:40	00:39:42	They didn't want to go home.
642	00:39:42	00:39:44	They wanted an adventure.
643	00:39:44	00:39:47	I promised them a dollar for every golf ball they brought back.
644	00:39:47	00:39:50	Lucas wasn't feeling well, so he stayed in the car with me.
645	00:39:50	00:39:58	And you knew that Jason wanted money, so he could go to Texas and see his dad, so you bribed him in order to be alone with Lucas.
646	00:39:59	00:40:00	I didn't molest him.
647	00:40:00	00:40:01	Who took his shirt off?
648	00:40:01	00:40:05	He was hot. What were you gonna do to him once his shirt was off?
649	00:40:05	00:40:06	It was innocent.
650	00:40:06	00:40:08	He wasn't feeling well.
651	00:40:08	00:40:12	He laid his head in my lap.
652	00:40:14	00:40:17	I touched his hair.
653	00:40:17	00:40:20	I didn't want to...
654	00:40:22	00:40:25	I loved him.
655	00:40:25	00:40:27	I loved Lucas, and he loved me.
656	00:40:27	00:40:29	Is that what you think?
657	00:40:29	00:40:33	Then why didn't you help him?
658	00:40:33	00:40:35	He told you he hit his head.
659	00:40:35	00:40:37	He was in pain.
660	00:40:37	00:40:38	He had a concussion, Carl.
661	00:40:38	00:40:40	You must have known that.
662	00:40:40	00:40:42	I'm sure he was dizzy, probably had no appetite.
663	00:40:42	00:40:49	Maybe he was even slurring his words, but you didn't care about that, because you wanted what you wanted.
664	00:40:51	00:40:53	Lucas?!
665	00:40:54	00:40:56	His brain was bleeding.
666	00:40:56	00:41:06	Now, most kids won't die from that, because someone who really loves them takes them to the hospital, but instead, you gave him alcohol and aspirin, a lethal combination for his head injury.
667	00:41:06	00:41:09	It prevented his blood from clotting.
668	00:41:10	00:41:13	You killed him, Carl.
669	00:41:13	00:41:23	And you would have killed Jason, too, except he ran away from you and crawled into a drain pipe.
670	00:41:29	00:41:31	Hey.
671	00:41:32	00:41:34	Hey, what are you doing in there?
672	00:41:34	00:41:36	You're not listening to me.
673	00:41:36	00:41:38	I didn't want to hurt anyone.
674	00:41:38	00:41:41	I need you to believe me.
675	00:41:41	00:41:43	I don't.
676	00:41:43	00:41:45	You had choices.
677	00:41:45	00:41:47	You made the wrong ones.
678	00:41:48	00:41:51	And now this little boy is gone.
679	00:41:58	00:42:03	So I talked Voris into violating parole, and we're adding the charges of negligent homicide.
680	00:42:03	00:42:05	You're not gonna see Carl for a long time.
681	00:42:05	00:42:11	Also, we, uh... we've arrested the grandpa, Terrance Crowley, for child abuse.
682	00:42:11	00:42:13	Everybody wins.
683	00:42:13	00:42:15	Except Lucas.
684	00:42:15	00:42:18	You're gonna fry.
685	00:42:18	00:42:20	You drove him right to it...!
686	00:42:20	00:42:21	You did this!
687	00:42:21	00:42:23	You did this! I'll kill you!
688	00:42:25	00:42:27	Where is Carl Fisher?
689	00:42:27	00:42:29	You can't take him to County...
690	00:42:29	00:42:31	Mr. Crowley's civil rights were violated.
691	00:42:32	00:42:33	This department is racist.
692	00:42:33	00:42:35	Excuse me! I was here first.
693	00:42:35	00:42:36	My client has been detained illegally.
694	00:42:36	00:42:39	You cannot charge Mister...
