0	00:00:03	00:00:06	How does an eagle fly?
1	00:00:06	00:00:08	With wings?
2	00:00:08	00:00:12	I don't know. Ask the chicken how that's working out.
3	00:00:12	00:00:16	An eagle flies because it is fearless.
4	00:00:16	00:00:22	Using its force of mind, the eagle is the lord of the sky.
5	00:00:24	00:00:32	My name is Alan Quinn and I believe that you are all eagles.
6	00:00:34	00:00:35	Thank you, friends.
7	00:00:35	00:00:39	Thank you for visiting this sacred paradise.
8	00:00:39	00:00:46	If you join my week-long Force Of Mind seminar, you... will... conquer... fire.
9	00:00:46	00:00:49	Your fears will vanish.
10	00:00:49	00:00:55	Your work, your relationship, everything in your life will be enriched.
11	00:00:56	00:00:58	Now who wants to come fly with me?
12	00:00:58	00:01:01	Come on! I don't see every hand up.
13	00:01:01	00:01:03	Who wants to come fly with me?!
14	00:01:04	00:01:06	Come on! Let's go, people!
15	00:01:06	00:01:08	Let's go! Come on in the back there!
16	00:01:10	00:01:12	Ciao, David.
17	00:01:12	00:01:13	Oh... (chuckles)
18	00:01:13	00:01:15	I wish you were here.
19	00:01:15	00:01:20	Ciao bella, Elisabetta, il mia amore. I wish I were there, too.
20	00:01:20	00:01:22	You do? You're not avoiding me?
21	00:01:22	00:01:24	Of course not. Work beckons.
22	00:01:24	00:01:26	(chuckles) It's so beautiful here.
23	00:01:26	00:01:28	So empowering.
24	00:01:28	00:01:29	Empowering?
25	00:01:29	00:01:32	Sounds like you've been sipping the Alan Quinn Kool-Aid.
26	00:01:32	00:01:35	I'm about to enter the sacred mud spring.
27	00:01:35	00:01:38	Ugh, if I can't see the bottom, I don't go in.
28	00:01:38	00:01:40	If you were with me, you'd see something else.
29	00:01:40	00:01:43	It's all natural here.
30	00:01:43	00:01:46	I assume that this is a private mud spring?
31	00:01:46	00:01:50	Just me and nature.
32	00:01:50	00:01:51	Ciao, David.
33	00:02:06	00:02:08	Ciao... (speaks Italian)
34	00:02:08	00:02:10	Is that your fiancé on the phone?
35	00:02:10	00:02:12	You're such a tease, huh?
36	00:02:12	00:02:14	Have you told him about me?
37	00:02:14	00:02:16	It's not the right time.
38	00:02:22	00:02:26	Santo? Non é buffo.
39	00:02:26	00:02:28	Not funny!
40	00:02:29	00:02:32	Mi hai fatto paura! You scare me!
41	00:02:35	00:02:36	Stop kicking!
42	00:02:36	00:02:37	I'm not kicking you!
43	00:02:37	00:02:39	You, stop rubbing me.
44	00:02:39	00:02:39	I'm not.
45	00:02:55	00:02:58	Welcome to your hot springs nightmare.
46	00:02:58	00:03:01	Floater in a natural mud bath.
47	00:03:01	00:03:04	Why does this place look so familiar?
48	00:03:04	00:03:07	Because Alan Quinn shoots his infomercials here.
49	00:03:07	00:03:08	This is his resort.
50	00:03:08	00:03:09	Right.
51	00:03:09	00:03:11	The Force of Mind guy.
52	00:03:11	00:03:13	All over late-night TV.
53	00:03:13	00:03:16	I don't think this'll make his next ad.
54	00:03:16	00:03:18	Watch your step.
55	00:03:22	00:03:25	What do we got?
56	00:03:25	00:03:27	It's a unknown male. There's no I.D.
57	00:03:27	00:03:30	Liver temp's ambient with the mud.
58	00:03:30	00:03:33	Body's bloated, but there's no sloughing of the skin.
59	00:03:33	00:03:38	I'd say he's been dead at least 24 hours, but probably no more than 36.
60	00:03:38	00:03:40	Heard a couple of bathers found him.
61	00:03:40	00:03:43	It floated up between them while they were messing around.
62	00:03:43	00:03:44	Yeah.
63	00:03:44	00:03:45	And we know one of the bathers.
64	00:03:45	00:03:47	That's Elisabetta.
65	00:03:47	00:03:49	Hodges' girlfriend?
66	00:03:49	00:03:52	Yep. She was taking a dip with Fabio over there.
67	00:03:52	00:03:54	They're sharing a room.
68	00:03:54	00:03:56	She and Hodges are still engaged, right?
69	00:03:56	00:03:58	Far as I know.
70	00:03:58	00:04:00	Hey, what is that right there?
71	00:04:00	00:04:03	Looks like bruising.
72	00:04:03	00:04:04	Maybe handprints?
73	00:04:04	00:04:06	Could be he was held down.
74	00:04:07	00:04:10	So, not an accidental drowning.
75	00:04:12	00:04:14	Murder in paradise.
76	00:04:50	00:04:52	You conquer fire...
77	00:04:55	00:04:57	...you can conquer anything.
78	00:04:58	00:05:00	It is all within you.
79	00:05:00	00:05:04	Here you go. Force of mind.
80	00:05:04	00:05:05	You got it-- yeah!
81	00:05:05	00:05:07	(laughs) There you go.
82	00:05:07	00:05:09	Feels good to be an eagle, doesn't it?
83	00:05:09	00:05:11	Doesn't it? Alan Quinn?
84	00:05:11	00:05:14	Captain Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
85	00:05:14	00:05:17	Excuse me, birdman, do me a favor-- fly back to your room.
86	00:05:17	00:05:20	I need to speak to your spirit guide.
87	00:05:20	00:05:26	Hey, what's going on, Alan? Aren't you concerned that a murder victim was found in your mud springs?
88	00:05:26	00:05:28	Of course I'm concerned.
89	00:05:28	00:05:29	It's a tragedy.
90	00:05:29	00:05:33	Mr. Quinn, we're kind of hoping you could help us identify the victim.
91	00:05:33	00:05:36	As far as I know, every employee, every guest has been accounted for.
92	00:05:36	00:05:38	And I handed over our registry to one of your guys.
93	00:05:38	00:05:39	Well, somebody got stuck in the mud.
94	00:05:39	00:05:43	All I can think is, uh, probably a hiker.
95	00:05:43	00:05:44	Sadly some people can't afford the entrance fee.
96	00:05:44	00:05:48	So what do you think, they sneak down from the hillside?
97	00:05:48	00:05:49	If they're not a bother, I look the other way.
98	00:05:49	00:05:52	In the end, these springs are for everyone, right?
99	00:05:52	00:05:55	That's a beautiful sentiment, Alan.
100	00:05:55	00:05:56	But let me tell you what's happening.
101	00:05:56	00:06:02	Right now, these springs and every inch of this ground belongs to us.
102	00:06:02	00:06:04	You got it?
103	00:06:08	00:06:11	You know, I kind of miss playing in the mud.
104	00:06:11	00:06:15	Sacred bubbly mud. Even better.
105	00:06:15	00:06:18	Heard you might need some extra on-site testing.
106	00:06:18	00:06:20	I'm here to help.
107	00:06:20	00:06:23	She's over by the reception area.
108	00:06:27	00:06:30	Elisabetta, Elisabetta, mi amore.
109	00:06:30	00:06:32	It was horrible, David.
110	00:06:32	00:06:34	Oh, it's okay, it's okay. I'm here.
111	00:06:34	00:06:37	Now, I heard you were with someone?
112	00:06:37	00:06:40	Si. Santo.
113	00:06:41	00:06:43	He's my brother, David.
114	00:06:43	00:06:45	He's visiting from Tuscany.
115	00:06:45	00:06:48	But I checked the hotel register, and he has a different last name.
116	00:06:48	00:06:50	And you two were staying in the same room.
117	00:06:50	00:06:52	You don't trust me, David?
118	00:06:52	00:06:57	I do, it's just I want to, but I don't understand.
119	00:06:57	00:07:02	Santo and I have different last name because...
120	00:07:02	00:07:04	I was married before.
121	00:07:04	00:07:06	I keep my husband last name.
122	00:07:06	00:07:09	David, I was very young.
123	00:07:09	00:07:10	Why didn't you tell me you were married before?
124	00:07:10	00:07:11	I tried.
125	00:07:11	00:07:13	You've been so busy.
126	00:07:13	00:07:14	You never have time for me.
127	00:07:14	00:07:19	How much time does it take for someone to just say, By the way, I'm divorced, Italian-style?
128	00:07:19	00:07:21	It was just one week.
129	00:07:21	00:07:22	Not helping.
130	00:07:22	00:07:23	I'll explain everything.
131	00:07:23	00:07:24	Era niente.
132	00:07:24	00:07:25	It was nothing.
133	00:07:25	00:07:28	Please.
134	00:07:37	00:07:39	Ready?
135	00:07:39	00:07:40	Let's get dirty.
136	00:08:07	00:08:10	This looks like the last of it.
137	00:08:13	00:08:16	Hold on-- there's something's wedged between the rocks right here.
138	00:08:23	00:08:24	Leather bracelet?
139	00:08:24	00:08:28	It looks clean. That means it wasn't in here for very long.
140	00:08:28	00:08:32	Maybe it belonged to someone who was in here with our vic.
141	00:08:32	00:08:35	Maybe even our killer.
142	00:08:38	00:08:42	Doc, what do we have?
143	00:08:42	00:08:44	Confirmation our victim drowned.
144	00:08:44	00:08:47	Stomach contents are muddy.
145	00:08:47	00:08:50	Also confirmation we're dealing with a homicide.
146	00:08:50	00:08:55	In addition to the apparent bruising to our victim's chest, I also found this abrasion on his forehead.
147	00:08:55	00:08:58	Think he was hit before he went in?
148	00:08:58	00:09:00	Possibly.
149	00:09:00	00:09:02	These were embedded inside the wound track.
150	00:09:02	00:09:05	Looks like wooden splinters.
151	00:09:05	00:09:06	Maybe from a weapon.
152	00:09:12	00:09:13	Beaten and then drowned?
153	00:09:13	00:09:16	I'll send this off to Hodges.
154	00:09:16	00:09:20	John Doe had a maxillary partial denture.
155	00:09:20	00:09:23	Four numbers are engraved on the metal framework.
156	00:09:23	00:09:27	Most dentists I.D. their patients using the last four digits of their Social.
157	00:09:27	00:09:30	Should give us a name.
158	00:09:35	00:09:37	Mrs. Wade.
159	00:09:37	00:09:39	Hi.
160	00:09:39	00:09:42	I'm, um, I'm sorry for your loss.
161	00:09:42	00:09:44	I thought Justin was still at the spa.
162	00:09:44	00:09:46	I can't believe this.
163	00:09:46	00:09:48	You weren't with him at the spa?
164	00:09:48	00:09:51	No, he was on a corporate retreat with his sales team.
165	00:09:51	00:09:54	Justin's a... a rep at Bixton.
166	00:09:54	00:09:56	Bixton-- the pharmaceutical company?
167	00:09:56	00:09:58	That's right.
168	00:09:58	00:10:02	The company uses Alan Quinn's team-building techniques.
169	00:10:02	00:10:08	Do you know, um, if Justin had problems with any of his co-workers?
170	00:10:08	00:10:10	No. He loved his job...
171	00:10:10	00:10:12	our life together...
172	00:10:12	00:10:16	We were just getting started.
173	00:10:16	00:10:17	When was the last time that you spoke with him?
174	00:10:17	00:10:21	Uh...
175	00:10:21	00:10:22	two days ago.
176	00:10:22	00:10:23	This is so stupid.
177	00:10:23	00:10:25	He didn't even want to go.
178	00:10:26	00:10:28	I convinced him.
179	00:10:28	00:10:31	Why didn't he want to go?
180	00:10:31	00:10:33	He thought it was New Agey and-and silly.
181	00:10:33	00:10:39	I had stayed at the spa before, so I thought it would be good for him.
182	00:10:43	00:10:46	Wow, look at that. What wasn't in this mud bath?
183	00:10:46	00:10:49	Yeah, it looks like the day after a frat party.
184	00:10:49	00:10:52	Complete with the muddy walk-of-shame evidence.
185	00:10:52	00:10:54	The condoms are swabbed for DNA.
186	00:10:54	00:10:55	Henry got no results.
187	00:10:55	00:10:57	As well as the bottles and cigarette butts.
188	00:10:57	00:10:59	And that pigeon feather is disgusting.
189	00:10:59	00:11:04	Really, all of this stuff looks like it's been down there a couple of weeks except for this thing right here.
190	00:11:04	00:11:06	Doesn't even have any mud on it.
191	00:11:08	00:11:09	Can I see that thing?
192	00:11:09	00:11:11	Mm-hmm.
193	00:11:16	00:11:17	What are you doing?
194	00:11:17	00:11:18	This is a...
195	00:11:18	00:11:20	eagle feather, maybe?
196	00:11:20	00:11:27	You know, you put this little tassel thing on the end of the feather, you got yourself a smudge feather.
197	00:11:27	00:11:30	A what? Smudge feather.
198	00:11:30	00:11:35	Native American Indians use it sometimes to waft incense around.
199	00:11:35	00:11:40	My mom used to use a smudge feather to cleanse the negativity from our house.
200	00:11:40	00:11:44	I thought you said your house was a van? Believe me, that van needed a lot of smudging. Wait a sec.
201	00:11:44	00:11:45	Smudge feather.
202	00:11:45	00:11:46	Where have I seen that?
203	00:11:46	00:11:50	Alan Quinn sent over a list of everyone on the retreat.
204	00:11:50	00:11:52	Opening day itinerary.
205	00:11:52	00:11:56	He divided everyone into teams of three.
206	00:11:56	00:11:59	Each team was named after a type of eagle.
207	00:11:59	00:12:02	So, this is a white-tailed eagle.
208	00:12:02	00:12:10	And the feather symbol that Alan Quinn gave to you and your Bixton team-- which consisted of you, Heather, and Jessica Lowell and Justin Weed.
209	00:12:10	00:12:18	First, let me say, as a citizen and as a representative of Bixton, I want to cooperate fully in this investigation.
210	00:12:18	00:12:20	I very much appreciate that.
211	00:12:20	00:12:24	So, Justin's feather was found in his room.
212	00:12:24	00:12:28	And this feather was found where he died.
213	00:12:28	00:12:30	So, whose feather is it?
214	00:12:30	00:12:32	Is it your feather or is it Jessica's feather?
215	00:12:36	00:12:40	You and Jessica need some time to get your story straight?
216	00:12:40	00:12:43	I have nothing to hide.
217	00:12:43	00:12:44	We were both with Justin.
218	00:12:44	00:12:47	Heather wanted a team strategy meeting.
219	00:12:47	00:12:49	Having it at Club Mud was my idea.
220	00:12:49	00:12:53	00.
221	00:12:53	00:12:54	And what was the mood in the mud?
222	00:12:54	00:12:56	Was everything cool with Justin?
223	00:12:56	00:13:00	Justin was over the whole Alan Quinn team-building- eagle-flying-thing.
224	00:13:00	00:13:02	He just wanted to go home. Sure.
225	00:13:02	00:13:04	And what about you and Heather?
226	00:13:04	00:13:05	Who doesn't like a free mud bath?
227	00:13:05	00:13:11	Heather, on the other hand, spent that last day looking like she was gonna pop a button on her pant suit.
228	00:13:11	00:13:12	Why's that?
229	00:13:12	00:13:14	She wasn't happy with the team.
230	00:13:14	00:13:20	I don't want to speak ill of the deceased, but Justin let the team down.
231	00:13:20	00:13:21	How so?
232	00:13:21	00:13:23	He wouldn't do the firewalk.
233	00:13:23	00:13:25	And why would that concern your team?
234	00:13:25	00:13:28	Alan Quinn sends an assessment report back to Bixton.
235	00:13:28	00:13:32	Your team fails mission objectives, you get a bad score.
236	00:13:32	00:13:34	So you were upset with Justin?
237	00:13:34	00:13:36	Maybe even got into a shoving match.
238	00:13:36	00:13:40	Not liking your insinuation here.
239	00:13:40	00:13:44	They were both alive and well when I left.
240	00:13:44	00:13:49	So, you're saying that Jessica and Justin stayed in the mud bath together.
241	00:13:49	00:13:50	Don't know what happened after that.
242	00:13:50	00:13:51	We just...
243	00:13:51	00:13:52	talked.
244	00:13:52	00:13:54	He was distracted.
245	00:13:54	00:13:57	I was half-naked and he didn't even blink.
246	00:13:57	00:13:59	All he could talk about was his wife.
247	00:13:59	00:14:02	Why are the good ones always so boring?
248	00:14:02	00:14:04	So, how'd the night end?
249	00:14:04	00:14:07	We got out at the same time. Now wait a minute...
250	00:14:07	00:14:10	(sighs) Justin got out of the mud bath? Yeah.
251	00:14:10	00:14:11	We walked back together.
252	00:14:11	00:14:13	I saw him go into his room.
253	00:14:13	00:14:15	00.
254	00:14:15	00:14:18	Okay.
255	00:14:18	00:14:19	Thank you, Jessica.
256	00:14:19	00:14:22	You can call me Jess.
257	00:14:22	00:14:24	Any time.
258	00:14:26	00:14:28	You text me?
259	00:14:28	00:14:30	Indeed, I did.
260	00:14:30	00:14:34	I understand our women in the mud bath claim that Justin Wade exited the mud?
261	00:14:34	00:14:37	Yeah, yeah, before he returned to it to drown.
262	00:14:37	00:14:41	I sense your frustration and I may have something to assuage it.
263	00:14:43	00:14:45	The bruising on the victim's chest, right? Mm-hmm.
264	00:14:45	00:14:50	Histology results of the tissue reveal fluid loss from damaged blood vessels.
265	00:14:50	00:14:53	Swelling and blistering that was obfuscated from the bloating.
266	00:14:53	00:14:58	Blistering. So you're saying that he was burned before he was drowned?
267	00:14:58	00:15:06	According to Doc Robbins, an inhaled substance caused urticaria and angioedema along the interior of the primary bronchi.
268	00:15:06	00:15:08	I think the cause-- smoke.
269	00:15:08	00:15:10	Okay.
270	00:15:10	00:15:13	And, you recall that Justin Wade had splinters in his forehead?
271	00:15:13	00:15:15	Yeah, he was hit by some kind of weapon, right?
272	00:15:15	00:15:17	I think not.
273	00:15:17	00:15:20	The splinters are wood from the Northwestern Red Cedar.
274	00:15:20	00:15:25	It's a tree that's sacred to Native Americans used in rituals and rites of passage.
275	00:15:25	00:15:28	Like Alan Quinn's firewalks.
276	00:15:28	00:15:30	Wood in his head, smoke in his lungs.
277	00:15:30	00:15:34	I think between dips in the mud, Justin Wade played with fire.
278	00:15:34	00:15:37	And, I can prove it.
279	00:15:37	00:15:39	If... you'll firewalk this way.
280	00:15:45	00:15:50	First of all, walking across hot coals doesn't take force of mind, it takes force of physics.
281	00:15:50	00:15:55	Coal's lightweight carbon structure is a poor conductor of heat.
282	00:15:55	00:15:58	The layer of ash further insulates the heat.
283	00:15:58	00:16:04	Firewalks are conducted at night so you see the red, burning coals, and not the layer of ash that coats them.
284	00:16:04	00:16:05	Phew, whoa!
285	00:16:05	00:16:06	You sure about this?
286	00:16:06	00:16:08	That's hot enough to cook meat.
287	00:16:08	00:16:10	But your feet only make contact for two-tenths of a second.
288	00:16:10	00:16:15	The key is to walk softly and steadily.
289	00:16:20	00:16:23	Ecco, amico mio.
290	00:16:23	00:16:25	I am an eagle!
291	00:16:25	00:16:26	All right, what about the victim?
292	00:16:26	00:16:28	He didn't receive his wings.
293	00:16:28	00:16:35	While we know that Justin Wade was a reluctant spiritual warrior, Heather, his teammate, was unhappy with his unwillingness to walk the fire.
294	00:16:35	00:16:44	So you think that after Heather berated him in the mud bath, he went back to his room, and he warriored up, and he gave it a shot.
295	00:16:44	00:16:46	Bad shot.
296	00:16:46	00:16:51	I think he panicked halfway across, tripped and fell.
297	00:16:51	00:16:53	Forehead hitting an unburned piece of cedar.
298	00:16:53	00:16:56	Discoloration on the chest that we thought was bruising...
299	00:16:56	00:16:58	was really burns.
300	00:16:58	00:17:02	You know, the firewalk was fenced off from the rest of the spa.
301	00:17:02	00:17:06	Even if Justin Wade warriored up, there's only one person who conducts the firewalk.
302	00:17:06	00:17:11	Alan Quinn. Bad for business if a client ends up with third-degree burns and in the hospital.
303	00:17:11	00:17:15	Better if he ends up accidentally drowned in the mud bath.
304	00:17:15	00:17:18	Letting the healing waters cover up all the sins.
305	00:17:28	00:17:32	Justin Wade... the floater in your mud.
306	00:17:32	00:17:35	He wasn't a hiker, he was your client.
307	00:17:35	00:17:39	We have evidence that ties Justin to the kind of cedar wood that you use in your firewalk.
308	00:17:39	00:17:42	He wanted to make a firewalk to help his team.
309	00:17:42	00:17:44	He needed your guidance, maybe?
310	00:17:44	00:17:47	Didn't turn out so good, huh?
311	00:17:47	00:17:48	Come on, Alan.
312	00:17:48	00:17:50	You lied to us.
313	00:17:50	00:17:52	You were with Justin that night.
314	00:17:52	00:17:54	Force of mind.
315	00:17:54	00:17:56	Be brave.
316	00:17:56	00:17:58	Tell us what happened.
317	00:17:58	00:18:02	I had no idea it was Justin.
318	00:18:02	00:18:05	Uh, he called me to his room, wanted to do a firewalk.
319	00:18:05	00:18:06	So, you took him up there? No.
320	00:18:06	00:18:09	Uh, I sensed he wasn't ready.
321	00:18:09	00:18:13	You know, I'd rather have someone not do the walk than try and fail.
322	00:18:13	00:18:15	Told him to go to bed.
323	00:18:15	00:18:16	What time was this?
324	00:18:16	00:18:17	30.
325	00:18:17	00:18:19	Went home after that.
326	00:18:19	00:18:21	Back to your room. No, home.
327	00:18:21	00:18:22	Santa Barbara.
328	00:18:22	00:18:24	Flew back Friday, midnight.
329	00:18:24	00:18:25	You fly like an eagle?
330	00:18:25	00:18:26	Or fly commercial?
331	00:18:26	00:18:29	Private jet.
332	00:18:29	00:18:30	Call my co-pilot, he'll confirm it.
333	00:18:34	00:18:35	Hey, Doc. Hey.
334	00:18:35	00:18:40	What do we got? I am looking at a sample from Justin Wade's bronchial tissue.
335	00:18:40	00:18:43	I don't think the smoke from the firewalk caused this inflammation.
336	00:18:43	00:18:45	Take a look.
337	00:18:47	00:18:54	He had an acute mast cell degranulation resulting in a massive release of histamines, tryptases and chymases.
338	00:18:54	00:18:57	The guy suffered anaphylactic shock.
339	00:18:57	00:18:59	Caused by what?
340	00:18:59	00:19:02	Unknown. I only see effect, not cause.
341	00:19:02	00:19:07	That's weird. We thought that Justin Wade fell in the fire because he had an anxiety attack.
342	00:19:07	00:19:10	No, what he really had was an allergy attack.
343	00:19:10	00:19:16	Okay, well, I'll send this tissue up to Hodges, have him run a Rast test and find out what caused it.
344	00:19:47	00:19:48	Ciao, Morgan. Hi.
345	00:19:48	00:19:50	Thanks for meeting me.
346	00:19:50	00:19:53	Yeah. I was actually surprised you wanted to meet up with me.
347	00:19:53	00:19:55	I don't have so many amici here.
348	00:19:55	00:19:58	Friends. So, I was thinking maybe we could talk.
349	00:19:58	00:20:02	David's speaking about you so much.
350	00:20:02	00:20:05	I think you two guys... are very close.
351	00:20:05	00:20:07	We're very good friends.
352	00:20:07	00:20:11	Friends? To a certain degree.
353	00:20:11	00:20:13	What are we talking?
354	00:20:13	00:20:17	I just feel that there is a weird distance between us.
355	00:20:17	00:20:19	I feel there is something wrong.
356	00:20:19	00:20:24	Trust me, honey, there is absolutely nobody else.
357	00:20:24	00:20:27	When I look at the two of you, you are so great together.
358	00:20:27	00:20:30	And-and he is smitten with you.
359	00:20:30	00:20:32	But why he seem so unhappy lately?
360	00:20:32	00:20:34	He doesn't speak about marriage anymore.
361	00:20:34	00:20:36	I think...
362	00:20:36	00:20:39	you need to talk to David.
363	00:20:39	00:20:41	You need to have this conversation...
364	00:20:41	00:20:44	with him.
365	00:20:48	00:20:50	I'm not gonna ask.
366	00:20:50	00:20:52	Really? How disappointing. Mm, I'm not doing it.
367	00:20:52	00:20:54	I wore it for you.
368	00:20:54	00:20:55	Fine. What?
369	00:20:55	00:21:06	swim cap, hot water bottle, balloons, cleaning gloves, bath mat, shower curtain-- they're all made of latex.
370	00:21:06	00:21:13	And, uh, thanks to my assiduous testing, I've determined are the cause of our victim's allergic reaction.
371	00:21:13	00:21:15	He had a reaction to latex?
372	00:21:15	00:21:19	Aren't you missing the obvious, the condom that we found in the mud bath...?
373	00:21:19	00:21:23	We're not talking about the pedestrian skin contact here.
374	00:21:23	00:21:26	Justin Wade's bronchial constriction says he inhaled the latex.
375	00:21:26	00:21:28	How's that happen?
376	00:21:28	00:21:31	Well, you know what they say where there's latex vapor there's fire.
377	00:21:38	00:21:41	So you're saying there was latex in the burning coals of the firewalk.
378	00:21:41	00:21:43	Greg's at the primary now, looking for the culprit.
379	00:21:43	00:21:45	Interesting theory.
380	00:21:45	00:21:48	You know, latex allergy's kind of a personal thing.
381	00:21:48	00:21:50	Yeah, something only a spouse might know of.
382	00:21:52	00:21:57	Justin Wade's wife, Mary, told me that she'd been to Alan Quinn's spa before.
383	00:21:57	00:21:59	So she knows all about the firewalk.
384	00:21:59	00:22:04	Man alone in the mud bath with two women, one of whom admits to hitting on him.
385	00:22:04	00:22:05	Workplace romance?
386	00:22:05	00:22:07	I wouldn't know anything about that.
387	00:22:07	00:22:09	Just sayin'.
388	00:22:09	00:22:11	Could be a cause for murder.
389	00:22:11	00:22:16	I'm assuming you're aware your husband had a latex allergy, Mrs. Wade?
390	00:22:16	00:22:17	Yes, why?
391	00:22:17	00:22:21	We discovered that he had an extreme allergic reaction before he died.
392	00:22:21	00:22:23	But he was always so careful.
393	00:22:23	00:22:25	You said it was all good between you two?
394	00:22:25	00:22:27	That's right.
395	00:22:27	00:22:29	Well, not according to his phone records.
396	00:22:29	00:22:33	About three weeks ago, Jessica Lowell started calling Justin.
397	00:22:33	00:22:35	A lot. Work calls, I'd imagine.
398	00:22:35	00:22:39	Most of the calls here are after work, after midnight, in fact.
399	00:22:39	00:22:41	What does this have to do...
400	00:22:41	00:22:42	with Justin's death?
401	00:22:42	00:22:44	Mary, you told me that you were home the night that Justin died.
402	00:22:44	00:22:46	But that isn't true, is it?
403	00:22:46	00:22:50	You got a speeding ticket ten miles from the spa at, uh, let's see...
404	00:22:50	00:22:53	30 p.m.
405	00:22:53	00:22:55	Okay, I...
406	00:22:55	00:22:57	realize how this must look.
407	00:22:57	00:22:58	Looks bad.
408	00:22:58	00:23:00	Okay, yes.
409	00:23:00	00:23:03	I was on my way to the spa.
410	00:23:04	00:23:07	I had a feeling about Jessica Lowell.
411	00:23:07	00:23:09	So you went to confront them. Yes.
412	00:23:09	00:23:11	But I didn't.
413	00:23:11	00:23:12	Okay, I filled up my car, and I...
414	00:23:12	00:23:14	and I turned around, and I went home.
415	00:23:14	00:23:16	Look, I told you...
416	00:23:16	00:23:19	I loved my husband.
417	00:23:19	00:23:21	And in the end...
418	00:23:21	00:23:23	that meant trusting him.
419	00:23:25	00:23:27	Just got back from Alan Quinn's fire walk.
420	00:23:27	00:23:29	Knee-deep in coal ash, found these.
421	00:23:29	00:23:30	Drug implant pellets.
422	00:23:30	00:23:32	Used for maintaining hormone levels.
423	00:23:35	00:23:36	What are they made of?
424	00:23:36	00:23:38	Latex.
425	00:23:39	00:23:41	Looks to me like one of them isn't fully burned.
426	00:23:41	00:23:43	Logo says...
427	00:23:43	00:23:46	Made by Bixton.
428	00:23:46	00:23:48	The same company Justin Wade worked for.
429	00:23:48	00:23:50	That can't be a coincidence.
430	00:23:50	00:23:52	Nope.
431	00:23:52	00:23:53	Here, maybe I can get a partial.
432	00:24:16	00:24:20	Jessica Lowell is not returning Brass's phone calls.
433	00:24:20	00:24:21	She's also a no-show at work.
434	00:24:21	00:24:23	Sounds like she's on the run.
435	00:24:23	00:24:25	Bixton sent over her employee file.
436	00:24:25	00:24:29	Three years ago, she was suspended from work for six months.
437	00:24:29	00:24:33	She and two other employees were under suspicion of selling company secrets.
438	00:24:35	00:24:36	But she wasn't fired. No.
439	00:24:36	00:24:37	They didn't have enough on her.
440	00:24:37	00:24:38	Okay, so what are we thinking?
441	00:24:38	00:24:42	That Jessica Lowell was up to her old tricks again, stealing from the company?
442	00:24:42	00:24:45	Justin Wade finds out, she kills him.
443	00:24:45	00:24:48	If that's the case, there's still one more member of Team White-Tailed Eagle.
444	00:24:48	00:24:53	Heather Conner. Right, and if she found out what Justin Wade found out, we need to find her now.
445	00:24:53	00:24:54	Thank you.
446	00:24:57	00:24:59	All right, Heather, thank you very much for coming in.
447	00:24:59	00:25:01	I don't know what happened to Justin.
448	00:25:01	00:25:03	I swear.
449	00:25:03	00:25:05	Can I please have some water?
450	00:25:05	00:25:07	It's right there in front of you.
451	00:25:07	00:25:11	Sorry, of course. Heather, you need to relax, okay?
452	00:25:11	00:25:13	You are not a suspect.
453	00:25:13	00:25:16	What we need right now is to find Jessica.
454	00:25:21	00:25:25	Jessica's not who she says she is.
455	00:25:25	00:25:27	Who is she?
456	00:25:27	00:25:29	A thief.
457	00:25:30	00:25:33	She steals company secrets.
458	00:25:33	00:25:36	And Justin found out.
459	00:25:36	00:25:37	Is that why he's dead? Yes.
460	00:25:37	00:25:44	I think Jessica kills anyone who gets in her way.
461	00:25:46	00:25:47	Oh, this water's terrible.
462	00:25:47	00:25:52	The Jessica Lowells are destroying Bixton.
463	00:25:52	00:25:53	Consider a new typical drug.
464	00:25:53	00:26:00	After an average development cost of 900 million, a successful launch depends on sales reps delivering complex information.
465	00:26:00	00:26:05	I put every fiber of my soul into this company.
466	00:26:05	00:26:07	Into America! Heather, slow down.
467	00:26:07	00:26:09	It's okay. I try...
468	00:26:09	00:26:10	to do the right thing.
469	00:26:10	00:26:15	I try... so hard to be good.
470	00:26:15	00:26:16	Are you okay?
471	00:26:16	00:26:19	(wheezing) I need a medic! Oh, my God.
472	00:26:19	00:26:22	...2-3, we need a medic in here. I need a medic now!
473	00:26:27	00:26:28	Finn... hey, listen to me, listen to me.
474	00:26:28	00:26:29	You did everything you could.
475	00:26:29	00:26:32	Now just-just get the body to Doc as soon as you can.
476	00:26:32	00:26:35	Whew! Finlay's at E.R.
477	00:26:35	00:26:38	Conner girl didn't make it. I mean, it's crazy.
478	00:26:38	00:26:40	A seemingly healthy woman just drops during an interrogation?
479	00:26:40	00:26:45	Kind of like Justin taking a header in the middle of his firewalk.
480	00:26:45	00:26:49	Doesn't make any sense. Well, the only common denominator is Jessica Lowell-- maybe she poisoned them both.
481	00:26:49	00:26:50	Do we know where she is yet?
482	00:26:50	00:26:52	Still in the wind.
483	00:26:52	00:26:59	Haven't had a chance to open up Heather Conner yet, to determine C.O.D.-- but, in the washroom, David found this.
484	00:26:59	00:27:02	White powder under her fingernails.
485	00:27:02	00:27:04	Hodges says it's magnesium sulfate.
486	00:27:04	00:27:06	Common dietary supplement.
487	00:27:06	00:27:08	Yeah, David found a receipt in her purse.
488	00:27:08	00:27:11	She'd been stocking up on all sorts of nutrients and powders.
489	00:27:11	00:27:15	Maybe Jessica Lowell spiked her vitamin shake.
490	00:27:15	00:27:16	Could explain her death.
491	00:27:16	00:27:18	Now for the unexplainable.
492	00:27:19	00:27:21	David also found...
493	00:27:21	00:27:24	strands of animal hair.
494	00:27:24	00:27:27	Hodges I.D.'d it as capra aegagrus hircus.
495	00:27:27	00:27:29	Goat? Yeah.
496	00:27:29	00:27:31	She had goat hair all over her.
497	00:27:31	00:27:32	I didn't say it made sense.
498	00:27:32	00:27:34	Mm, something better start making sense.
499	00:27:40	00:27:44	You here on business or to make another girl date with my fiancée?
500	00:27:44	00:27:45	She told you we met.
501	00:27:45	00:27:49	No, uh, she texted me by mistake.
502	00:27:49	00:27:52	Morgan, thank you for listening.
503	00:27:52	00:27:53	My new amica.
504	00:27:53	00:27:56	She just wanted to talk.
505	00:27:56	00:27:59	Look, I'm on your side, Hodges.
506	00:27:59	00:28:00	She's a great girl.
507	00:28:00	00:28:02	Who feels that I'm backing away.
508	00:28:02	00:28:04	Are you?
509	00:28:07	00:28:10	Ah, saved by the tox report.
510	00:28:12	00:28:13	Whoa.
511	00:28:13	00:28:17	Heather Conner was higher than Elvis at the Vegas Hilton.
512	00:28:17	00:28:19	So she wasn't poisoned.
513	00:28:19	00:28:20	She O.D.'d.
514	00:28:20	00:28:22	Makes sense.
515	00:28:22	00:28:24	You said you found magnesium sulfate underneath her fingernails, right?
516	00:28:24	00:28:27	Yeah, I thought that was from a vitamin drink.
517	00:28:27	00:28:29	But it's also used to manufacture meth.
518	00:28:29	00:28:33	Drug sales rep becomes drug cook, becomes drug addict.
519	00:28:33	00:28:35	Deadly career path.
520	00:28:35	00:28:37	So, she's tweaking on meth, she's called in by PD.
521	00:28:37	00:28:40	She's worried that we figured it all out-- the illegal drugs.
522	00:28:40	00:28:42	She takes some downers to calm down.
523	00:28:42	00:28:45	And she downs herself forever, right in front of us.
524	00:28:45	00:28:48	I hear you get very thirsty on meth.
525	00:28:48	00:28:50	Check out the stomach contents.
526	00:28:50	00:28:54	Lacteal secretions high in potassium, niacin and copper.
527	00:28:54	00:28:55	Milk.
528	00:28:55	00:28:56	Goat milk.
529	00:28:56	00:28:58	The udder milk.
530	00:28:59	00:29:00	Come on, it's too easy.
531	00:29:00	00:29:02	No, it's too much goat.
532	00:29:02	00:29:04	We found goat hair on Heather's clothes.
533	00:29:07	00:29:10	Text from Nick.
534	00:29:10	00:29:14	Our prime suspect, Jessica Lowell, just turned herself in.
535	00:29:14	00:29:16	Thought you were on the run.
536	00:29:16	00:29:17	Business trip.
537	00:29:17	00:29:19	I came back as soon as possible.
538	00:29:19	00:29:20	I want to cooperate.
539	00:29:20	00:29:21	Well, that's good.
540	00:29:21	00:29:24	You knew the murder victim Justin Wade.
541	00:29:24	00:29:25	The guy who was drowned in a mud bath?
542	00:29:25	00:29:30	We found your prints on the latex pellets that were tossed into the firewalk to knock Justin out.
543	00:29:30	00:29:32	Those pellets were samples.
544	00:29:32	00:29:35	We all had them at the retreat.
545	00:29:35	00:29:39	Captain Brass, I believe you know Colin Garrett with the FBI field office here.
546	00:29:39	00:29:42	Mm-hmm. We're working together.
547	00:29:42	00:29:43	I'm not a sales rep.
548	00:29:43	00:29:45	I handle corporate security at Bixton.
549	00:29:45	00:29:47	I'm teamed up with the FBI right now.
550	00:29:47	00:29:53	Justin Wade and Heather Conner were under investigation for stealing research and drugs to manufacture designer meth.
551	00:29:53	00:29:56	Just slip your mind to mention that to me before?
552	00:29:56	00:30:00	And the last time I checked, big pharmaceuticals don't sell street meth. No.
553	00:30:00	00:30:04	But we have all the chemicals at hand, and cutting-edge lab technology.
554	00:30:04	00:30:06	We believe they set up a lab somewhere.
555	00:30:06	00:30:08	Well, that still doesn't explain how Justin ended up dead.
556	00:30:08	00:30:11	Are you familiar with Rolan Zahl?
557	00:30:11	00:30:13	Drug distributor-- bad news.
558	00:30:13	00:30:15	Worse news for Justin.
559	00:30:15	00:30:16	Zahl was his street connect.
560	00:30:16	00:30:21	Feds think that once he finished with the lab, he became expendable.
561	00:30:21	00:30:24	So you're saying that Justin Wade's murder was a drug hit?
562	00:30:24	00:30:27	You have a better theory?
563	00:30:27	00:30:29	Did you follow up on the Rolan Zahl drug angle?
564	00:30:29	00:30:33	Yup, I tested some meth pulled off a Mad-10 dealer two days ago.
565	00:30:33	00:30:35	Same trace contaminants we found in Heather Conner?
566	00:30:35	00:30:37	To a tee.
567	00:30:37	00:30:44	Okay, well, I did a little follow-up of my own on the magnesium sulfate from, uh, Heather's fingernails. Uh-huh.
568	00:30:44	00:30:50	According to her credit cards, she bought about 200 pounds of the stuff last month, from a medical supply company.
569	00:30:50	00:30:53	And it was shipped to Greenlore Scientific.
570	00:30:53	00:30:56	AKA our secret meth lab. That's right.
571	00:30:56	00:31:00	Looks like it's time to pay a visit to 93644 Dagwood Street.
572	00:31:12	00:31:13	LVPD! Open up!
573	00:31:16	00:31:18	LVPD! Open up!
574	00:31:18	00:31:19	Go, Stokes.
575	00:31:26	00:31:28	LVPD! Open up!
576	00:31:28	00:31:29	Go.
577	00:31:44	00:31:46	What the...?
578	00:32:15	00:32:18	Looks like they cleared out.
579	00:32:18	00:32:20	Think we found our lab.
580	00:32:20	00:32:21	Yeah, what's left of it.
581	00:32:21	00:32:24	Hold on, Nick.
582	00:32:24	00:32:25	Check this out.
583	00:32:28	00:32:29	Well, somebody trashed the place.
584	00:32:35	00:32:39	This is too elaborate just to manufacture meth.
585	00:32:42	00:32:44	Industrial fridge.
586	00:32:44	00:32:46	Don't usually see that in a meth lab.
587	00:32:46	00:32:47	Nope.
588	00:32:51	00:32:53	Got milk?
589	00:32:53	00:32:56	Right-- goat's milk, I'm guessing.
590	00:32:56	00:33:01	Distillation condenser-- this is some very complex chemistry.
591	00:33:01	00:33:03	Microporous membranes?
592	00:33:03	00:33:10	You don't use that to make meth. I got to say a lot of the stuff in here just doesn't fit with making street drugs.
593	00:33:33	00:33:34	Mrs. Wade?!
594	00:33:34	00:33:36	Please don't hurt me.
595	00:33:44	00:33:49	Nick's still collecting evidence, but he sent over some trace from the farmhouse lab.
596	00:33:49	00:33:51	It's definitely meth.
597	00:33:51	00:33:52	So, what do you think?
598	00:33:52	00:33:54	Husband and wife cooking team?
599	00:33:54	00:33:56	Looks like it.
600	00:33:56	00:33:58	Looks like it?
601	00:33:58	00:34:00	The goat milk doesn't make sense.
602	00:34:00	00:34:04	Well, maybe it's some kind of cutting agent for the meth.
603	00:34:04	00:34:05	Ah, it's more than that.
604	00:34:05	00:34:06	There was...
605	00:34:06	00:34:11	a lot of sophisticated equipment in that lab; stuff you don't need to make meth.
606	00:34:17	00:34:20	Something else was cooking in that kitchen.
607	00:34:31	00:34:34	I know you think Justin, Heather and I are all meth dealers.
608	00:34:36	00:34:37	Yeah, I do.
609	00:34:38	00:34:40	you need the money because you're sick.
610	00:34:42	00:34:47	I... have a chronic deficiency of the antithrombin.
611	00:34:47	00:34:48	It's an anti-coagulant.
612	00:34:48	00:34:50	And without it, I'm...
613	00:34:50	00:34:53	in constant danger of blood clots.
614	00:34:53	00:34:54	Which can cause a pulmonary embolism.
615	00:34:57	00:35:00	So, Justin was using a Bixton drug formula to help you.
616	00:35:00	00:35:03	It uses goat milk to make the antithrombin protein.
617	00:35:03	00:35:07	It's why Justin took the job with Bixton in the first place.
618	00:35:07	00:35:08	To steal the recipe?
619	00:35:08	00:35:10	Yes.
620	00:35:10	00:35:13	The drug's called Btryn.
621	00:35:13	00:35:17	It was canceled during clinical trials three years ago.
622	00:35:17	00:35:19	Company deemed it too expensive.
623	00:35:19	00:35:25	My disease is extremely rare, so there wouldn't have been enough customers.
624	00:35:25	00:35:28	Yeah, those pharmaceutical giants have their bills to pay.
625	00:35:28	00:35:32	So, Justin started making the drug himself.
626	00:35:32	00:35:34	But he needed the money to do it.
627	00:35:34	00:35:37	That's where Heather came in.
628	00:35:37	00:35:41	It was her crazy idea to set up the lab.
629	00:35:41	00:35:43	Was the Btryn working?
630	00:35:43	00:35:45	I've been on it for about a month now.
631	00:35:45	00:35:46	Justin was right.
632	00:35:46	00:35:49	It's-it's actually helped stabilize me.
633	00:35:49	00:35:53	I never knew that he was making meth.
634	00:35:53	00:35:56	I only found out about it a couple days ago.
635	00:35:56	00:35:59	You know, I don't get why you destroyed the lab.
636	00:35:59	00:36:01	I mean, it was your one chance to get the medicine.
637	00:36:01	00:36:03	I... I didn't destroy it.
638	00:36:03	00:36:04	I went to get my last dose.
639	00:36:12	00:36:14	If Mary Wade's telling the truth...
640	00:36:14	00:36:19	and she isn't the one that trashed this place...
641	00:36:19	00:36:20	Then who did?
642	00:36:20	00:36:22	All this...
643	00:36:22	00:36:24	destruction, this rage.
644	00:36:24	00:36:26	This is personal.
645	00:36:26	00:36:27	Yeah, I think I got something here.
646	00:36:27	00:36:29	In the sink. Check it out.
647	00:36:32	00:36:37	Maybe in the middle of going Hulk, our suspect cut himself on some glass.
648	00:36:39	00:36:41	Rinsed it off in the sink.
649	00:36:41	00:36:43	And left behind some blood.
650	00:37:03	00:37:05	Russell?
651	00:37:05	00:37:08	I got DNA on the blood from the meth lab sink.
652	00:37:08	00:37:11	You are not gonna believe who broke into the place.
653	00:37:11	00:37:14	Come on, Sheila.
654	00:37:14	00:37:15	Exhale the weakness.
655	00:37:15	00:37:16	Release the toxins.
656	00:37:18	00:37:20	Feels strong, right?
657	00:37:20	00:37:23	Just have faith in me.
658	00:37:23	00:37:25	No fear.
659	00:37:25	00:37:29	Mary Wade have faith in you, Alan?
660	00:37:30	00:37:31	I'm sorry?
661	00:37:31	00:37:33	Can you give us a second?
662	00:37:33	00:37:38	I wanted to talk to Alan about the blood he left in the meth lab.
663	00:37:39	00:37:40	Because you did.
664	00:37:40	00:37:42	When you broke in.
665	00:37:42	00:37:45	Force of entry more than force of mind.
666	00:37:45	00:37:47	I have no idea what you're talking about.
667	00:37:47	00:37:50	Did you teach Mary your breathing exercises?
668	00:37:50	00:37:52	And... did you know she was sick?
669	00:37:52	00:37:55	I wouldn't-- Because we checked your credit cards.
670	00:37:55	00:38:02	You've been shipping her cases of that Spirit Force drink of yours. You do that for all your clients, Alan?
671	00:38:02	00:38:05	I'm trying to help Mary. Well, of course you are.
672	00:38:05	00:38:07	I mean, good heavens, you're in love with her, right?
673	00:38:09	00:38:12	Mary's a very special... very brave woman.
674	00:38:12	00:38:14	Yeah, she is. But you didn't answer my question.
675	00:38:17	00:38:18	You know, I came from nothing.
676	00:38:18	00:38:21	Built an empire.
677	00:38:21	00:38:24	Truth is, I never found anyone who interested me.
678	00:38:24	00:38:27	Until Mary.
679	00:38:27	00:38:32	When you find your other half, that...
680	00:38:32	00:38:35	is what it's really like to fly.
681	00:38:37	00:38:41	Have you found your other half?
682	00:38:41	00:38:43	Wow. That's so romantic.
683	00:38:43	00:38:45	The truth is, she didn't want to fly with you, did she?
684	00:38:45	00:38:47	I mean, she didn't want to have anything to do with you, Alan.
685	00:38:47	00:38:49	And you know why?
686	00:38:49	00:38:50	Because her husband already found a cure for her.
687	00:38:50	00:38:53	Something that actually worked.
688	00:38:53	00:38:54	Is that what happened?
689	00:38:54	00:38:55	Hmm?
690	00:38:55	00:38:58	You found out that his worked, yours didn't?
691	00:38:58	00:39:01	Is that why you destroyed his lab?
692	00:39:01	00:39:02	Well, come on, man.
693	00:39:02	00:39:05	Usually you have all the answers.
694	00:39:05	00:39:07	You know something?
695	00:39:07	00:39:09	I've seen people like you before.
696	00:39:09	00:39:11	And you make me sick.
697	00:39:11	00:39:15	You sell snake oil to the weak.
698	00:39:15	00:39:19	So you think Justin Wade was so good?
699	00:39:19	00:39:20	He was poisoning her.
700	00:39:20	00:39:22	I wasn't gonna watch her die.
701	00:39:26	00:39:29	Modern medicine?
702	00:39:29	00:39:31	That's the real snake oil here.
703	00:39:31	00:39:39	They spend millions conning people into buying chemicals and pills, so they can make billions.
704	00:39:39	00:39:41	(scoffs) The weak?
705	00:39:41	00:39:42	I...
706	00:39:42	00:39:46	I make people strong.
707	00:39:46	00:39:49	Justin Wade, he didn't understand that.
708	00:39:49	00:39:51	And he didn't understand Mary.
709	00:39:51	00:39:52	I do.
710	00:39:52	00:39:54	You killed him, didn't you?
711	00:39:59	00:40:01	You're damn right I did.
712	00:40:03	00:40:05	Whatever it took to save Mary's life.
713	00:40:09	00:40:12	To heal her; to make her fly.
714	00:40:12	00:40:14	And I'd do it again.
715	00:40:18	00:40:20	Thank you.
716	00:40:27	00:40:30	David, everything is okay?
717	00:40:30	00:40:33	Are you still upset because I didn't tell you about my past?
718	00:40:33	00:40:34	No, no, it has nothing to do with that.
719	00:40:34	00:40:38	I don't care that you were married for a week.
720	00:40:38	00:40:40	Because...
721	00:40:40	00:40:43	I want to marry you.
722	00:40:43	00:40:46	For...forever.
723	00:40:46	00:40:49	Then why are you running from me?
724	00:40:51	00:40:52	'Cause I'm an idiot.
725	00:40:52	00:40:55	And I'm afraid. Of what?
726	00:40:55	00:40:56	Me?
727	00:40:56	00:40:59	My family? No, no. Um...
728	00:40:59	00:41:02	Having a family.
729	00:41:03	00:41:05	My father...
730	00:41:05	00:41:10	wasn't around very much when I grew up and when he was around, he-he really wasn't.
731	00:41:10	00:41:11	He was a scientist.
732	00:41:11	00:41:13	He was always holed up in the basement.
733	00:41:13	00:41:15	You're afraid you will turn into him?
734	00:41:15	00:41:17	Terrified. David...
735	00:41:17	00:41:21	you fear things that have never happened.
736	00:41:21	00:41:22	Don't you think it's a waste of time?
737	00:41:22	00:41:26	Not if I'm wasting it with you.
738	00:41:31	00:41:33	Hey.
739	00:41:33	00:41:36	I, uh, have your husband's wedding ring.
740	00:41:36	00:41:37	Thanks.
741	00:41:37	00:41:39	Blood test confirmed your illness.
742	00:41:39	00:41:42	I hope someday there's a drug that will help you.
743	00:41:51	00:41:52	Have you ever...
744	00:41:52	00:41:56	flown in your dreams?
745	00:41:56	00:42:01	Ever since Justin died I'm so numb all day, but when I sleep...
746	00:42:03	00:42:06	I'm healthy, I'm free and...
747	00:42:08	00:42:10	...I fly.
748	00:42:11	00:42:14	And he's with me somehow.
749	00:42:16	00:42:22	And then I wake and... I'm alone but I'm... I'm not as sad.
750	00:42:22	00:42:26	Because I can still feel his presence.
751	00:42:26	00:42:28	You two must've loved each other very much.
752	00:42:28	00:42:30	I'm sorry.
753	00:42:30	00:42:32	Maybe someday, there'll be a drug that can save me.
754	00:42:32	00:42:34	Maybe not.
755	00:42:36	00:42:43	All I know is when I remember all the good that we had...
756	00:42:43	00:42:44	I'm fearless.
