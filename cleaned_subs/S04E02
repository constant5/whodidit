0,00:00:02,00:00:07,Previously onCSI: You got a husband-and-wife serial team killing couples.
1,00:00:07,00:00:11,Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
2,00:00:11,00:00:14,They were never going to let him go.
3,00:00:14,00:00:16,WILLOWS: It's just so sick.
4,00:00:16,00:00:21,"We are this close to busting a pair of serial killers, and the judge won't issue a warrant?"
5,00:00:21,00:00:22,"Hey, I'm just the messenger."
6,00:00:22,00:00:24,The affidavit is standing.
7,00:00:24,00:00:25,You've signed warrants for less.
8,00:00:25,00:00:26,Love is not love.
9,00:00:26,00:00:27,Love is conditional.
10,00:00:27,00:00:29,For most people.
11,00:00:29,00:00:29,But not for you.
12,00:00:29,00:00:31,Then she stuck her tongue in this jerk.
13,00:00:31,00:00:35,"Rifkin's ear-- chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too."
14,00:00:35,00:00:36,Should get a warrant.
15,00:00:36,00:00:37,BRASS: Las Vegas Police.
16,00:00:38,00:00:40,We got a problem.
17,00:00:40,00:00:43,Somebody got to our serials before we did.
18,00:00:56,00:00:57,Are you carrying?
19,00:00:57,00:01:00,No.
20,00:01:00,00:01:02,Then get the hell out of here while I secure the room.
21,00:01:30,00:01:33,This is Brass. Yeah.
22,00:01:33,00:01:38,I'm at 11546 Blackbird Lane.
23,00:01:38,00:01:40,Got two gunshot victims.
24,00:01:40,00:01:42,Send rescue.
25,00:01:42,00:01:43,There's no rush.
26,00:01:43,00:01:46,(sighs)
27,00:01:48,00:01:50,Are those your guys?
28,00:01:52,00:01:54,"Yeah, they're UC."
29,00:01:54,00:01:56,How long they been sitting on the house?
30,00:01:56,00:02:02,"Oh, about the time that Judge Slater didn't sign the first warrant."
31,00:02:02,00:02:03,Two undercover guys outside.
32,00:02:03,00:02:06,Two dead bodies inside.
33,00:02:06,00:02:08,Makes you feel a little paranoid right now.
34,00:02:08,00:02:10,Not paranoid enough.
35,00:02:58,00:03:00,"Alright, Captain. What do you wanna know?"
36,00:03:00,00:03:02,"So, you guys been here the whole time?"
37,00:03:02,00:03:03,Almost.
38,00:03:03,00:03:04,What happened?
39,00:03:05,00:03:06,Tell him.
40,00:03:06,00:03:09,"Around 7:00, there was a 444 call..."
41,00:03:09,00:03:11,Citizen reports officer down.
42,00:03:11,00:03:14,2529 Harmon Hill.
43,00:03:14,00:03:16,All units in the vicinity respond.
44,00:03:16,00:03:17,We met up with a couple black-and-whites.
45,00:03:17,00:03:19,UTL.
46,00:03:19,00:03:22,W... What is that?
47,00:03:24,00:03:25,Unable to locate.
48,00:03:25,00:03:27,False alarm. We came right back.
49,00:03:27,00:03:30,Observed no activity in the house until you guys got here.
50,00:03:30,00:03:32,You know we're going to need to see your guns.
51,00:03:32,00:03:35,Why would we off two scumbags when we know you're coming back with a warrant?
52,00:03:36,00:03:37,It wasn't a question.
53,00:03:37,00:03:38,And you're not my supervisor.
54,00:03:40,00:03:41,I am. I want your gun.
55,00:03:42,00:03:44,Give me your gun.
56,00:03:47,00:03:47,(sighs)
57,00:03:55,00:03:56,"Hey, help me out here."
58,00:03:59,00:04:01,"(sighs): And your backups, too."
59,00:04:01,00:04:02,Come on.
60,00:04:14,00:04:16,Satisfied?
61,00:04:16,00:04:17,Just doing my job.
62,00:04:17,00:04:19,"Here you go. Fellas, check out the back."
63,00:04:19,00:04:21,Okay? Let's go.
64,00:04:38,00:04:41,These our serials?
65,00:04:42,00:04:43,So it seems.
66,00:04:45,00:04:48,Yesterday's suspects. Today's victims.
67,00:04:48,00:04:49,We had 'em...
68,00:04:55,00:04:57,Take the inside.
69,00:05:05,00:05:06,No sign of forced entry...
70,00:05:07,00:05:09,"on this door, at least."
71,00:05:15,00:05:17,Print the handle.
72,00:05:39,00:05:41,What do you think?
73,00:05:46,00:05:48,I don't know what that is.
74,00:05:48,00:05:50,"Make sure you get all of it, though."
75,00:05:51,00:05:54,You see any cartridge casings?
76,00:05:54,00:05:55,Not yet.
77,00:06:12,00:06:15,85.5.
78,00:06:17,00:06:21,So TOD was about 11:00 p.m.
79,00:06:32,00:06:34,"Grissom, I've got blood, but..."
80,00:06:36,00:06:38,a lot of pheno-negative stains as well.
81,00:06:38,00:06:40,We're going to bring everything back.
82,00:07:10,00:07:12,"What do you got, Warrick?"
83,00:07:14,00:07:18,"If the killer went out the back door, this may be his print."
84,00:07:22,00:07:24,Good thing Brass had cops watching the house.
85,00:07:24,00:07:30,"Linens and towels from the Sphere on top of the washing machine, and what I believe to be sheets from the motel inside the dryer."
86,00:07:30,00:07:31,Both positive presumptive for blood.
87,00:07:31,00:07:35,"Think they were being smart taking the sheets, or did they just get off sleeping on 'em?"
88,00:07:35,00:07:37,"Either way, they were sick and dangerous."
89,00:07:37,00:07:40,What does that say about whoever killed them?
90,00:07:40,00:07:42,Wh-What's the big deal? There's no humans involved.
91,00:07:42,00:07:44,"I mean, look, Captain."
92,00:07:44,00:07:47,"Come on. The way I see it, somebody did us a favor."
93,00:07:47,00:07:49,Yeah. They're dead. Case is closed.
94,00:07:49,00:07:50,"Hey, this isn't a favor, Bill."
95,00:07:50,00:07:52,This is a screwup.
96,00:07:52,00:07:53,Would've been a lot bigger screwup if...
97,00:07:53,00:07:57,if we didn't break surveillance and had an officer down four blocks away.
98,00:07:57,00:07:59,"All right, what else did you see?"
99,00:07:59,00:08:00,Kid in that house made us.
100,00:08:02,00:08:03,Thought we were bad news.
101,00:08:03,00:08:05,You are bad news.
102,00:08:07,00:08:11,I can't believe Grissom pulled us off that serial murder case.
103,00:08:11,00:08:14,"Yeah, well, let me tell you how it ends."
104,00:08:14,00:08:16,They die.
105,00:08:16,00:08:19,"Whoa, this isn't half bad for college kids."
106,00:08:19,00:08:23,Yeah. Why live in a one-room flea bag when you can pool your resources and live like this.
107,00:08:23,00:08:26,"Hey, how 'bout it: you, me, Warrick, Nick, Grissom..."
108,00:08:26,00:08:29,"Oh, can't. Not Grissom."
109,00:08:34,00:08:37,What the hell is this?
110,00:08:37,00:08:39,"Ma'am, you may want to take one of these."
111,00:08:39,00:08:41,Thank you. Thanks.
112,00:08:41,00:08:42,Where's the body?
113,00:08:42,00:08:43,Upstairs.
114,00:08:43,00:08:45,Upstairs?
115,00:08:50,00:08:53,It's raining man juice.
116,00:08:53,00:08:55,Hallelujah.
117,00:08:55,00:08:57,You might want to wear those.
118,00:08:57,00:08:58,Thank you.
119,00:08:58,00:09:00,"Well, weather's clearing."
120,00:09:00,00:09:02,"Yeah, if only the smell would."
121,00:09:02,00:09:04,(groans)
122,00:09:06,00:09:08,It's like a sewer in here.
123,00:09:23,00:09:25,"Oh, my goodness."
124,00:09:25,00:09:27,"Oh, God."
125,00:09:28,00:09:31,Soup's on.
126,00:09:31,00:09:33,(clears throat)
127,00:09:33,00:09:36,How long has he been in here?
128,00:09:36,00:09:38,Roommates last saw him Thursday night.
129,00:09:38,00:09:40,Took off for the weekend.
130,00:09:40,00:09:41,Came home to this.
131,00:09:41,00:09:45,Guy goes to take a shower and DFOs.
132,00:09:45,00:09:46,"He never got to the cold water, did he?"
133,00:09:47,00:09:49,Roommate said only the hot water faucet was on.
134,00:09:49,00:09:51,Must've been a steam bath in here.
135,00:09:51,00:09:52,Still is.
136,00:09:52,00:09:56,"Well, any evidence on the floor's been washed away."
137,00:09:56,00:09:57,"There, uh..."
138,00:09:57,00:09:59,(clears throat): could be something in the tub.
139,00:09:59,00:10:02,We got to take that body and get it through that door.
140,00:10:02,00:10:04,SARA: There's another option.
141,00:10:09,00:10:12,"MAN: I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th, just east of the intersection."
142,00:10:12,00:10:13,There's been a shooting.
143,00:10:13,00:10:15,I think a cop got shot.
144,00:10:15,00:10:16,"John, oh..."
145,00:10:16,00:10:17,Just occurred.
146,00:10:17,00:10:18,I heard the shots.
147,00:10:18,00:10:21,I received the call and issued the 444.
148,00:10:21,00:10:25,"Uniforms called back a few minutes later, said they checked the area, said it was a UTL."
149,00:10:25,00:10:26,You want to hear that?
150,00:10:26,00:10:30,I'll hear it when you give me a dub of the original caller's voice...
151,00:10:30,00:10:31,and his phone number.
152,00:10:31,00:10:33,I can get that for you right now.
153,00:10:33,00:10:35,Good.
154,00:10:48,00:10:52,(phone dialing)
155,00:10:52,00:10:54,(line ringing)
156,00:10:59,00:11:00,Are we done?
157,00:11:01,00:11:03,"If I'm not done, you're not done."
158,00:11:03,00:11:08,"We already gave you our footprints, and our fingerprints are on file, so what else do you need?"
159,00:11:08,00:11:10,Which way is Harmon Hill?
160,00:11:22,00:11:24,(phone ringing in distance)
161,00:12:31,00:12:35,"BRASS: So, Bradley, you saw our police officer at that door?"
162,00:12:35,00:12:36,Yeah...
163,00:12:36,00:12:38,and I was watching these guys all night.
164,00:12:38,00:12:43,"See, the two bad guys drove away in the van, and then the policeman showed up, knocked on the door."
165,00:12:43,00:12:45,Mr. Klinefeld let him in...
166,00:12:45,00:12:46,but he never came back out.
167,00:12:46,00:12:47,Did you see a police car?
168,00:12:47,00:12:49,Must've walked here.
169,00:12:49,00:12:51,Did you hear any gunshots?
170,00:12:51,00:12:52,Nope.
171,00:12:52,00:12:54,"Okay, thanks, Bradley. Good job."
172,00:12:54,00:12:56,No problem.
173,00:13:00,00:13:04,Ever see a beat cop anywhere but the Strip?
174,00:13:05,00:13:07,And how'd he beat us to the killer?
175,00:13:14,00:13:15,Trace evidence.
176,00:13:15,00:13:18,Definitely doesn't belong in the wound track.
177,00:13:18,00:13:20,Did your guy get shot through a window?
178,00:13:20,00:13:22,No.
179,00:13:22,00:13:25,We found a lot of this material at the crime scene.
180,00:13:26,00:13:27,Absence of gunshot residue.
181,00:13:28,00:13:32,GRISSOM: Maybe he was shot through some sort of object.
182,00:13:32,00:13:38,"Well, Mr. Klinefeld was shot once in the front and Mrs. Klinefeld once in the back."
183,00:13:39,00:13:40,(yelling)
184,00:13:40,00:13:41,(gunshot)
185,00:13:41,00:13:47,"Dare I say the couple that slays together, lays together?"
186,00:14:30,00:14:33,This drain hasn't been tampered with.
187,00:14:33,00:14:35,It's just clogged.
188,00:14:35,00:14:36,I think this is an accidental.
189,00:14:36,00:14:39,There's nothing but young people stuff.
190,00:14:39,00:14:41,"No meds, except some aspirin."
191,00:14:41,00:14:44,No prescriptions.
192,00:14:44,00:14:46,"Well, I don't think that means much."
193,00:14:46,00:14:49,Chances are he's not getting his drugs from a medicine cabinet.
194,00:14:49,00:14:50,There's no sign of struggle.
195,00:14:50,00:14:53,Any prints would have been washed away.
196,00:14:53,00:14:54,(sighs)
197,00:14:54,00:14:56,Where does that leave us?
198,00:14:56,00:15:01,Same place we were when we walked through the door-- with a bloated floater.
199,00:15:04,00:15:07,"Hey, you know that cell phone Grissom found at the crime scene?"
200,00:15:07,00:15:08,Yeah.
201,00:15:08,00:15:11,Traced it back to a public defender.
202,00:15:11,00:15:13,Said she lost it.
203,00:15:13,00:15:15,Made life hell for her while she was in DC.
204,00:15:15,00:15:17,Mm...
205,00:15:17,00:15:21,Have you run a sample of this through the GCMS?
206,00:15:21,00:15:22,Mm-hmm. Polyethylene.
207,00:15:22,00:15:25,Polyethylene.
208,00:15:25,00:15:28,I got the results back from Grissom's ant puddle.
209,00:15:28,00:15:29,(beep) Mm-hmm.
210,00:15:29,00:15:33,"Corn syrup, glucose, caramel and water."
211,00:15:33,00:15:35,Hang on a second.
212,00:15:38,00:15:40,Where do you keep the sodium rhodizinate?
213,00:15:40,00:15:42,On top of the file cabinet.
214,00:15:42,00:15:43,"So, what's up?"
215,00:15:43,00:15:45,You and Bobby switched or what?
216,00:15:45,00:15:47,"Hey, Rich, whatever happened with those bullets?"
217,00:15:47,00:15:49,Six right nine-millimeter.
218,00:15:49,00:15:50,"Beretta, amongst others."
219,00:15:50,00:15:52,Consistent with an officer's duty weapon.
220,00:15:52,00:15:55,Consistent with Officer Commons and Officer Nowlin's weapons?
221,00:15:55,00:15:57,No match. That includes backups.
222,00:15:59,00:16:01,"Well, thanks."
223,00:16:02,00:16:03,"Hey, Warrick."
224,00:16:03,00:16:05,Yeah?
225,00:16:05,00:16:09,Polyethylene plus corn syrup plus GSR gives you what?
226,00:16:09,00:16:13,Polyethylene and corn syrup is... cola in a bottle.
227,00:16:13,00:16:17,GSR on the inside of a plastic bottle means...
228,00:16:17,00:16:19,Soda silencer.
229,00:16:22,00:16:24,Poor man's silencer.
230,00:16:24,00:16:27,Only good for a couple shots.
231,00:16:27,00:16:30,"So, that shooter was sitting on the house andthe surveillance team."
232,00:16:30,00:16:32,Empties out his bottle of soda...
233,00:16:32,00:16:36,"calls in an ""officer down""..."
234,00:16:39,00:16:43,...drops the phone and takes a walk.
235,00:16:45,00:16:47,What do you think?
236,00:16:50,00:16:54,Who do we have around here that could find us a somewhat used soda bottle?
237,00:19:54,00:19:55,Hey.
238,00:19:55,00:19:57,Floater's shirt.
239,00:19:57,00:19:59,Took it off his bed.
240,00:19:59,00:20:02,What does this look like to you?
241,00:20:04,00:20:05,A backwards seven.
242,00:20:05,00:20:08,"Yeah, that's what I got."
243,00:20:09,00:20:10,What's it doing on a DB's shirt?
244,00:20:11,00:20:13,I don't know.
245,00:20:22,00:20:24,Some kind of greasepaint or makeup.
246,00:20:24,00:20:26,How do you get paint on the inside of your clothes?
247,00:20:27,00:20:29,Rubs off your chest.
248,00:20:29,00:20:32,"Oh, what kind of guy paints his chest?"
249,00:20:32,00:20:34,Performance artist?
250,00:20:34,00:20:35,A clown maybe?
251,00:20:35,00:20:38,Sports freak.
252,00:20:40,00:20:42,"Well, it's not like you to have a one-track mind."
253,00:20:42,00:20:44,"If the evidence points to cops, we chase cops."
254,00:20:44,00:20:47,Jesse Commons and Bill Nowlin were doing what I asked them to do.
255,00:20:47,00:20:48,They were sitting on the house.
256,00:20:48,00:20:51,Until you can get enough physical evidence to support a warrant.
257,00:20:51,00:20:53,Somebody knew we were looking at the Klinefelds.
258,00:20:53,00:20:54,They knew where they lived.
259,00:20:54,00:20:55,That's somebody inside.
260,00:20:55,00:20:57,Cops don't take the law into their own hands.
261,00:20:57,00:20:58,Ha! In what city?
262,00:20:58,00:21:00,"Oh, you want to hit below the belt?"
263,00:21:00,00:21:04,"You know, a lot of people had access to the Klinefelds."
264,00:21:04,00:21:08,"Who knows, maybe CSI III Nicky Stokes opened up his mouth to another parking lot attendant."
265,00:21:10,00:21:13,There was an eyewitness who saw a uniform at the front door.
266,00:21:13,00:21:18,"Oh, come on, a ten-year-old insomniac kid, hyped up on sugar, going blind on X-Box."
267,00:21:18,00:21:20,Who knows what he saw?
268,00:21:20,00:21:21,"So, now you're discrediting your own witness?"
269,00:21:21,00:21:23,"All right, let's break it down."
270,00:21:23,00:21:26,"You got a public defender's cell phone, no prints."
271,00:21:26,00:21:29,"You got officers' weapons taken from the scene, not fired."
272,00:21:29,00:21:32,"You got officers' shoe prints, not matching the evidence print."
273,00:21:32,00:21:36,You got three black-and-whites confirming that Commons and Nowlin responded to a 444.
274,00:21:36,00:21:38,Give these guys a break.
275,00:21:38,00:21:40,Just because they weren't the shooters doesn't mean they weren't involved.
276,00:21:40,00:21:42,"Oh, what, so it's a conspiracy? Oh, please!"
277,00:21:42,00:21:44,You got a bogus 444 call two blocks away.
278,00:21:44,00:21:45,"Oh, come on, you know the deal."
279,00:21:45,00:21:46,You know better than that.
280,00:21:46,00:21:48,There's bogus calls come in every day.
281,00:21:48,00:21:51,"Well, maybe you don't, because you're the kind of guy who goes to serve a warrant without a gun."
282,00:21:51,00:21:53,I'm not a cop.
283,00:21:53,00:21:56,"Well, that's a distinction that could be lost when the suspect's still inside the house."
284,00:21:56,00:21:58,"Look, I had your back."
285,00:21:58,00:22:00,Now I expect you to have mine.
286,00:22:00,00:22:01,That's not the way it works.
287,00:22:01,00:22:02,In what city?
288,00:22:03,00:22:06,"Hey, guys? I found something."
289,00:22:06,00:22:07,Not now.
290,00:22:07,00:22:08,No. You need to see this.
291,00:22:10,00:22:11,Both of you. Now!
292,00:22:13,00:22:15,Please.
293,00:22:33,00:22:35,Sorry I didn't find the soda bottle.
294,00:22:38,00:22:40,This'll do.
295,00:22:48,00:22:49,Star-1 Uniforms.
296,00:22:49,00:22:51,It's the biggest uniform shop in town.
297,00:22:52,00:22:55,From casino dealers to cops.
298,00:22:55,00:22:56,Shirt's wet.
299,00:22:56,00:22:58,I found it in a storm drain.
300,00:22:58,00:22:59,Where exactly?
301,00:22:59,00:23:00,Two blocks west of the house.
302,00:23:00,00:23:02,Opposite direction from the 444.
303,00:23:06,00:23:07,Buttons.
304,00:23:08,00:23:10,Meaning?
305,00:23:10,00:23:12,All the new uniforms have zippers.
306,00:23:17,00:23:18,This collar's dry.
307,00:23:18,00:23:22,It's hot out-- at least a buck twenty-five.
308,00:23:22,00:23:24,Let's hope whoever was wearing that shirt sweats.
309,00:23:29,00:23:30,The badge looks legit.
310,00:23:30,00:23:33,I'll run the number.
311,00:23:38,00:23:48,"MAN: Roommates were unable to make a positive ID due to the accelerated decomposition, but dental records confirmed Daniel O'Hannissey."
312,00:23:48,00:23:53,"Laceration on the forehead-- macerated, but not significant."
313,00:23:54,00:23:55,Contusion with a small laceration...
314,00:23:55,00:23:57,"here, below the ear."
315,00:23:57,00:23:59,That did some damage.
316,00:23:59,00:24:04,There's an obvious hematoma in the subdural space consistent with a subdural bleed.
317,00:24:04,00:24:07,Herniation of the Uncinate Process on the same side.
318,00:24:07,00:24:09,"Doc, uh, why is his brain green?"
319,00:24:10,00:24:11,He was steamed.
320,00:24:11,00:24:13,Turns the brain into lime gelatin.
321,00:24:13,00:24:15,Cause of death?
322,00:24:15,00:24:16,Ruled out drowning.
323,00:24:16,00:24:17,There was no water in the lungs.
324,00:24:17,00:24:20,He was dead before he hit the water.
325,00:24:20,00:24:24,"So, you are looking at it-- a blow to the back of the head."
326,00:24:24,00:24:26,Resulted in a subdural hematoma.
327,00:24:26,00:24:29,Sort of like a slow leak in a tire.
328,00:24:30,00:24:31,A slow leak in a tire?
329,00:24:31,00:24:34,Odds are Danny had no idea he was bleeding in his brain.
330,00:24:34,00:24:35,He probably felt fine.
331,00:24:35,00:24:37,Maybe a little woozy.
332,00:24:37,00:24:39,"Then out of nowhere, he drops."
333,00:24:39,00:24:41,How long do you think he lived after the blow?
334,00:24:41,00:24:42,12 to 24 hours.
335,00:24:44,00:24:48,"Well, he had to have been in the water for a couple of days to look like this."
336,00:24:48,00:24:49,Roommates last saw him Thursday.
337,00:24:50,00:24:52,So I guess we start there and we work backwards.
338,00:24:53,00:24:54,Thanks.
339,00:24:54,00:24:55,Yeah.
340,00:24:57,00:24:58,I lost my badge years ago.
341,00:24:58,00:25:01,Filed a report. Got issued a new one.
342,00:25:01,00:25:04,"Yeah, I'm aware of officers ""losing"" their badges."
343,00:25:04,00:25:06,"Then we don't have a problem, do we?"
344,00:25:06,00:25:09,"No, we got a problem 'cause your badge was found in the proximity of a crime scene."
345,00:25:09,00:25:12,How'd you manage to lose your badge?
346,00:25:12,00:25:15,Such is life.
347,00:25:15,00:25:17,That's not the answer I was hoping for.
348,00:25:17,00:25:19,BRASS: I've been looking at your jacket.
349,00:25:19,00:25:20,Reads like a novel.
350,00:25:20,00:25:22,You got a lot of entries in here.
351,00:25:22,00:25:24,"You got, uh... beat-and-release."
352,00:25:24,00:25:26,You got some stick therapy. What's up with this?
353,00:25:26,00:25:30,"Show me a cop without a few entries in his jacket, I'll show you a pogue."
354,00:25:31,00:25:33,You referring to me?
355,00:25:34,00:25:38,Guys like you get to sit on your ass behind a desk because guys like me are out there doing the real work.
356,00:25:38,00:25:41,"BRASS: Okay, tough guy, tell me what you know."
357,00:25:41,00:25:44,I lost my badge. End of story.
358,00:25:44,00:25:47,"If I ever find the guy who stole it, believe..."
359,00:25:47,00:25:48,I want my union rep.
360,00:25:48,00:25:49,I'm it.
361,00:25:49,00:25:51,I want somebody impartial.
362,00:25:51,00:25:52,"Well, I was impartial."
363,00:25:52,00:25:53,Now open up.
364,00:25:58,00:26:00,You went for a bottle and found a shirt?
365,00:26:00,00:26:02,This swab is your new priority.
366,00:26:02,00:26:03,I was just filling Nick in...
367,00:26:03,00:26:04,Fill me in first.
368,00:26:04,00:26:05,The sweat stain?
369,00:26:05,00:26:07,"Uh, I was just getting started."
370,00:26:07,00:26:08,I can do them both together.
371,00:26:08,00:26:09,The shoe print?
372,00:26:09,00:26:11,Running it through Limbic.
373,00:26:11,00:26:14,How can you be doing that when you're standing here?
374,00:26:14,00:26:15,MAN (on tape): I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th.
375,00:26:15,00:26:16,Just east of the intersection.
376,00:26:16,00:26:17,There's been a shooting.
377,00:26:17,00:26:19,I think a cop got shot.
378,00:26:19,00:26:21,"John, oh... Just occurred."
379,00:26:21,00:26:22,I heard shots.
380,00:26:22,00:26:23,Where are we?
381,00:26:23,00:26:25,Check it out.
382,00:26:25,00:26:27,I think a cop got shot.
383,00:26:27,00:26:29,"John, oh... Just occurred."
384,00:26:29,00:26:30,I heard shots.
385,00:26:30,00:26:32,I have never heard a citizen that calm.
386,00:26:33,00:26:35,This 911 caller knew the drill.
387,00:26:35,00:26:37,He's using officers code.
388,00:26:37,00:26:38,'J' becomes john.
389,00:26:38,00:26:40,'O' becomes ocean.
390,00:26:40,00:26:42,J.O.-- just occurred.
391,00:26:42,00:26:43,Old habits die hard.
392,00:26:44,00:26:44,I'm only halfway home.
393,00:26:45,00:26:46,I need a voice exemplar.
394,00:26:46,00:26:47,Did you get a name off that badge?
395,00:26:47,00:26:48,Yeah.
396,00:26:48,00:26:51,"You know, Daniel was from Green Bay."
397,00:26:51,00:26:53,Big-time diehard football fan.
398,00:26:53,00:26:55,"He tried to walk-on here, but, uh..."
399,00:26:55,00:26:57,didn't make the team.
400,00:26:57,00:27:02,"But, hey, come game night, he was always at the stadium."
401,00:27:02,00:27:03,What about the away games?
402,00:27:03,00:27:06,He watched one game at home and lost all of his chill privileges.
403,00:27:06,00:27:08,It was ugly.
404,00:27:09,00:27:10,Define ugly.
405,00:27:10,00:27:12,"Busted the couch, jumping on it."
406,00:27:12,00:27:15,Neighbors called the cops 'cause he was so loud.
407,00:27:15,00:27:16,He was a real Bluto.
408,00:27:16,00:27:18,Where else did he 'Bluto'?
409,00:27:18,00:27:22,(loud rock music plays)
410,00:27:22,00:27:23,Everybody knew Dan-o.
411,00:27:23,00:27:26,He's the kind of guy that keeps a place like this in business.
412,00:27:27,00:27:28,I'm going to miss him.
413,00:27:28,00:27:30,When was the last time you saw him?
414,00:27:30,00:27:32,When was the last Rebel game?
415,00:27:32,00:27:34,Thursday.
416,00:27:34,00:27:35,Did you notice anything?
417,00:27:35,00:27:36,Did he...
418,00:27:36,00:27:36,feel okay?
419,00:27:36,00:27:37,Better than okay.
420,00:27:37,00:27:38,He was pumped.
421,00:27:38,00:27:42,He was so pumped that him and some of his buddies got into it with some other guys.
422,00:27:42,00:27:44,Wh-What do you mean? He started a fight?
423,00:27:44,00:27:46,"No, Shirley Temple started the fight."
424,00:27:46,00:27:50,Right there! Right there!
425,00:27:50,00:27:51,(hooting)
426,00:27:51,00:27:53,Drinks for the guys down there.
427,00:27:55,00:27:58,Shirley Temples-- extra cherries.
428,00:27:58,00:28:00,Shirley Temples all around.
429,00:28:02,00:28:03,"Hey, Wayne, those are for you, buddy."
430,00:28:03,00:28:05,Those are for you and your boys.
431,00:28:05,00:28:07,How did Shirley take it?
432,00:28:07,00:28:09,Not so good.
433,00:28:09,00:28:11,"Come here, tough guy."
434,00:28:13,00:28:14,(cheering and applause)
435,00:28:14,00:28:16,(yelling): Yeah!
436,00:28:16,00:28:17,You know how guys are.
437,00:28:17,00:28:19,They scrap until someone gets a touchdown.
438,00:28:19,00:28:22,"Yeah. Yeah, right."
439,00:28:22,00:28:25,Do you see any of those guys in here now?
440,00:28:29,00:28:31,There's a couple of Shirleys over there by the big screen.
441,00:28:33,00:28:37,"BROWN: Jen, I need a sample of Fromansky's voice."
442,00:28:37,00:28:39,What's it worth to you?
443,00:28:39,00:28:41,(chuckles)
444,00:28:41,00:28:42,Drinks?
445,00:28:42,00:28:45,I don't think you understand.
446,00:28:45,00:28:47,FROMANSKY (on tape): Officer in pursuit of late-model Honda Civic.
447,00:28:47,00:28:48,Possibly stolen.
448,00:28:48,00:28:50,Heading northbound on Koval Lane.
449,00:28:50,00:28:52,(clicks off tape) Hold on.
450,00:28:52,00:28:55,"Now, I've got three full minutes of Officer Fromansky here."
451,00:28:55,00:29:00,I was thinking of maybe taking it to the Dispatch Convention.
452,00:29:00,00:29:02,"Oh, no, no. Okay, okay."
453,00:29:03,00:29:06,Drinks at my place.
454,00:29:06,00:29:08,I can make that dub for you.
455,00:29:08,00:29:09,What time?
456,00:29:30,00:29:31,Got a second?
457,00:29:31,00:29:34,You're a suspect in an ongoing investigation.
458,00:29:34,00:29:36,We're not allowed to have a conversation.
459,00:29:37,00:29:39,"Let me tell you something, you arrogant clod."
460,00:29:40,00:29:41,I didn't shoot your suspects.
461,00:29:41,00:29:43,Wouldn't waste my life on them.
462,00:29:43,00:29:47,"Well, if that's true, then your DNA sample will rule you out."
463,00:29:47,00:29:51,"Someday, you're going to need me or my buddies at a scene..."
464,00:29:52,00:29:55,and wouldn't you know it-- we all hit traffic on the way.
465,00:29:57,00:29:59,"Is that how you do your job, Officer?"
466,00:30:01,00:30:02,Have a safe night.
467,00:30:07,00:30:12,(multiple voice prints running)
468,00:30:12,00:30:14,Officer in pursuit of late-model Honda Civic...
469,00:30:14,00:30:15,Just occurred...
470,00:30:15,00:30:16,I heard shots.
471,00:30:16,00:30:17,Heading northbound...
472,00:30:17,00:30:19,Just east of the intersection.
473,00:30:19,00:30:20,There's been a...
474,00:30:23,00:30:26,"Pitch, speed, volume-- they're all different."
475,00:30:26,00:30:28,It's not even close.
476,00:30:28,00:30:30,Maybe he disguised his voice.
477,00:30:30,00:30:32,There's no distortion.
478,00:30:32,00:30:34,"Fromansky didn't make that call, Gris."
479,00:30:36,00:30:40,"The, uh, sweat from the uniform not a match to Officer Fromansky."
480,00:30:54,00:30:57,You're a hard guy to find.
481,00:30:58,00:31:00,"I messed up, Jim."
482,00:31:00,00:31:03,I got ahead of the evidence.
483,00:31:03,00:31:05,"I made it personal, and I don't know why."
484,00:31:08,00:31:10,We both got a little stubborn.
485,00:31:10,00:31:14,Did a little head-butting.
486,00:31:14,00:31:15,I kind of liked it.
487,00:31:15,00:31:18,You were like your old self there.
488,00:31:18,00:31:19,Anyway...
489,00:31:21,00:31:23,"Fromansky was my idea, too."
490,00:31:23,00:31:25,I still think it's somebody inside.
491,00:31:25,00:31:29,"Pull off a murder like this, it takes some practice."
492,00:31:29,00:31:32,So... one thing I remembered.
493,00:31:32,00:31:36,"About six or seven months ago, we arrested a couple of gang-bangers."
494,00:31:36,00:31:41,"They were popping blackjack dealers on their way home from work, taking their toke envelopes."
495,00:31:41,00:31:47,"Because of some technicality, Judge Slater let them walk right out of the courtroom."
496,00:31:49,00:31:52,"I mean, they were talking about this in the precinct for weeks."
497,00:31:52,00:31:57,Now this morality play has a very quick and unhappy ending.
498,00:31:57,00:31:58,Somebody shot them.
499,00:31:58,00:32:00,Vigilantes?
500,00:32:00,00:32:02,Maybe.
501,00:32:02,00:32:06,"But still, I don't like a cop for this."
502,00:32:07,00:32:10,So take the cops out.
503,00:32:10,00:32:12,Who's left?
504,00:32:53,00:32:59,"""All for Our Country."" That's what he probably told himself."
505,00:33:10,00:33:14,"Like I told you before, if you're here for a warrant, you better have evidence to back it up."
506,00:33:14,00:33:16,"We're not here to get a warrant, Judge."
507,00:33:16,00:33:19,We're here to serve one.
508,00:33:19,00:33:22,"Wayne, you want to tell us about the game Friday night?"
509,00:33:22,00:33:24,You mean like strategy? Chalk talk?
510,00:33:24,00:33:27,Start with the Shirley Temples and go from there.
511,00:33:27,00:33:28,(laughs)
512,00:33:28,00:33:30,You're talking about those idiots from UNLV.
513,00:33:30,00:33:33,We have a witness that said you guys had a beef.
514,00:33:33,00:33:35,"Specifically, you and Number Seven."
515,00:33:35,00:33:37,"Dude, I don't even know those guys, okay?"
516,00:33:37,00:33:41,"They came in, they tried to be funny, and we set them straight."
517,00:33:41,00:33:42,How?
518,00:33:42,00:33:44,Gave them a little talking to.
519,00:33:44,00:33:46,Any blows exchanged? Physical contact?
520,00:33:46,00:33:49,Did that punk bitch rat us out?
521,00:33:49,00:33:51,It was harmless.
522,00:33:51,00:33:52,It was nothing.
523,00:33:52,00:33:54,Punk bitch?
524,00:33:54,00:33:55,A kid is dead.
525,00:33:56,00:33:57,What?
526,00:33:58,00:34:00,Dan O'Hannissey is dead.
527,00:34:01,00:34:04,I didn't do anything.
528,00:34:04,00:34:07,"Hey, that guy left before we did, and he was fine."
529,00:34:07,00:34:08,He was still running his mouth.
530,00:34:08,00:34:10,I suppose your buddies will testify to that?
531,00:34:10,00:34:11,"Yeah, they'll testify to that."
532,00:34:11,00:34:13,"Look, you can ask anybody who was in there."
533,00:34:15,00:34:17,Interesting ring you've got on.
534,00:34:20,00:34:21,The SMU Sharks.
535,00:34:21,00:34:24,That's a college ring.
536,00:34:25,00:34:26,Mind if I borrow it?
537,00:34:26,00:34:27,You want to borrow my ring?
538,00:34:27,00:34:29,Yeah.
539,00:34:29,00:34:31,Okay.
540,00:34:32,00:34:34,Take it.
541,00:34:35,00:34:36,I didn't do anything.
542,00:34:36,00:34:40,You're not under arrest. You're free to go.
543,00:34:42,00:34:45,You have a lot of nerve walking in my chambers accusing me of murder.
544,00:34:45,00:34:46,I'm not accusing you of murder.
545,00:34:46,00:34:49,I just want to see your shoes.
546,00:34:49,00:34:51,You've a warrant to search my closet? We need to see all your shoes.
547,00:34:51,00:34:53,That goes for your bailiff and your clerk as well.
548,00:34:53,00:34:55,"Gentlemen, please remove your shoes."
549,00:34:55,00:34:59,I'm sure you'd want to set an example for all court employees.
550,00:34:59,00:35:01,"The warrant is limited to me, my clerk and the bailiff?"
551,00:35:02,00:35:09,"The Klinefeld warrant was generated from this office, and only you three had access to their personal information, so... yeah."
552,00:35:09,00:35:13,"I look forward to the day you return to my courtroom, Detective."
553,00:35:15,00:35:17,Who issued the warrant?
554,00:35:17,00:35:19,Judge Correll.
555,00:35:19,00:35:20,Good judge.
556,00:35:20,00:35:22,Always count on him for paper.
557,00:35:24,00:35:27,Not this pair.
558,00:35:35,00:35:36,Not those.
559,00:35:38,00:35:40,You a smoker?
560,00:35:40,00:35:42,Is that a crime?
561,00:35:42,00:35:44,It's not good for you.
562,00:36:04,00:36:05,What tipped you to the ring?
563,00:36:05,00:36:06,Jaws.
564,00:36:07,00:36:08,Peter Benchley'sJaws?
565,00:36:09,00:36:12,"No, it was in Steven Spielberg'sJaws."
566,00:36:12,00:36:15,They had this mechanical shark named Bruce.
567,00:36:15,00:36:17,And he kept swimming round and round in circles.
568,00:36:17,00:36:19,How come?
569,00:36:19,00:36:21,His dorsal fin was bent.
570,00:36:24,00:36:27,How did Bruce's fin get bent?
571,00:36:27,00:36:29,Same way the kid's ring did.
572,00:36:30,00:36:32,It hit something.
573,00:36:33,00:36:36,"Don't be pushing, buddy!"
574,00:36:36,00:36:38,Come on!
575,00:36:38,00:36:42,(cheering)
576,00:36:47,00:36:48,Come on. Come on!
577,00:36:48,00:36:50,Come on!
578,00:36:50,00:36:53,"Forget it, man."
579,00:36:55,00:36:56,You got to be kidding me.
580,00:36:56,00:36:58,You threw a punch.
581,00:36:58,00:37:00,Probably a sucker punch.
582,00:37:00,00:37:03,"Look, I told you, that guy walked away."
583,00:37:03,00:37:04,But he was already dying.
584,00:37:04,00:37:06,And you're responsible.
585,00:37:07,00:37:10,Now who's the punk... bitch?
586,00:37:18,00:37:21,"This is Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police Department."
587,00:37:21,00:37:26,"Interview Room ""A."" I'm with Stuart Gardner, County Court Clerk."
588,00:37:26,00:37:31,"Please, um, state your name."
589,00:37:31,00:37:34,Stuart Gardner. G-a-r-d-n-e-r.
590,00:37:34,00:37:37,And spell it for the record.
591,00:37:37,00:37:38,That's right. You used to be a cop.
592,00:37:38,00:37:41,"Once a cop, always a cop."
593,00:37:41,00:37:42,You and I are brothers.
594,00:37:46,00:37:49,I'm not your brother.
595,00:37:57,00:37:58,You're a murderer.
596,00:37:58,00:38:01,I have a warrant to search these premises.
597,00:38:01,00:38:03,This is crap. You can't arrest me.
598,00:38:06,00:38:08,I'm not here to arrest you.
599,00:38:08,00:38:11,"What, wait a second..."
600,00:38:21,00:38:27,"We also found your old uniform shirt, with your DNA on the collar."
601,00:38:29,00:38:31,What are you going to retire on?
602,00:38:31,00:38:34,Psych? Medical? What?
603,00:38:34,00:38:36,Weren't you close to retirement?
604,00:38:37,00:38:39,After you shot that bystander?
605,00:38:39,00:38:41,"Ah, you want to talk about me, huh?"
606,00:38:45,00:38:48,You're a clerk. Get your facts straight.
607,00:38:48,00:38:49,He wasn't a bystander.
608,00:38:49,00:38:51,He was a passenger in a felony pursuit.
609,00:38:52,00:38:55,So how'd you get promoted to Captain after that?
610,00:38:55,00:38:58,Must be my good looks. You agreed to drive a desk...
611,00:38:58,00:39:02,at CSI... with all the sleazy civilians.
612,00:39:02,00:39:04,"Don't knock the CSI, Stuart."
613,00:39:04,00:39:05,They put a lot of bad guys away.
614,00:39:05,00:39:10,"You know, I'm going to give you a little therapy for free."
615,00:39:10,00:39:18,"You know, if you had only shown a little restraint, they would have processed the DNA after Klinefelds'."
616,00:39:18,00:39:19,Slam-dunk case.
617,00:39:19,00:39:22,Lots of guys get off on slam-dunk cases.
618,00:39:22,00:39:27,"Yeah, I bet you saw a lot of that working for Judge Slater, most liberal judge in the state."
619,00:39:27,00:39:34,"Bet you saw a lot of good cases go south, while you just processed those release forms, huh?"
620,00:39:34,00:39:37,Let me ask you something.
621,00:39:44,00:39:51,Doesn't it piss you off to put all your hard work in the hands of 12 people too stupid to get off jury duty?
622,00:39:55,00:39:58,"Stuart, sit down."
623,00:40:03,00:40:07,WARRICK: This guy's a nut job vigilante.
624,00:40:07,00:40:10,He's making the whole department look bad.
625,00:40:10,00:40:14,I guess he'd just figured he'd take a shortcut.
626,00:40:16,00:40:18,You've thought about it.
627,00:40:18,00:40:21,Yeah... lots of times.
628,00:40:23,00:40:25,What about you?
