0	0	00:00:06	00:00:09	Thank you. Have a good night.	N
1	1	00:00:09	00:00:12	Eagles covered, bruh.	N
2	2	00:00:12	00:00:13	Cough up the 20.	N
3	3	00:00:13	00:00:14	Man, backdoor touchdown.	N
4	4	00:00:14	00:00:15	Man, kills you every time.	N
5	5	00:00:15	00:00:17	Ha-ha!	N
6	6	00:00:17	00:00:19	Alright no more martini's for you.	N
7	7	00:00:28	00:00:29	Welcome to the Orpheus.	N
8	8	00:00:29	00:00:31	You checking in or just donating?	N
9	9	00:00:31	00:00:33	Checking in. Any bags, sir?	N
10	10	00:00:33	00:00:36	I got this one. Grab the one in the trunk.	N
11	11	00:01:09	00:01:09	Car bomb.	N
12	12	00:01:10	00:01:11	Driver and valet are dead.	N
13	13	00:01:11	00:01:13	Another valet is critical.	N
14	14	00:01:13	00:01:15	Got at least a dozen injured.	N
15	15	00:01:15	00:01:16	I was having dinner here.	N
16	16	00:01:16	00:01:17	Was on my way out.	N
17	17	00:01:17	00:01:20	It'd gone off a couple of seconds later, you'd be picking my badge up off the ground.	N
18	18	00:01:20	00:01:22	Thank God you're all right.	N
19	19	00:01:22	00:01:24	Sheriff, did they, uh, sweep the area for secondaries?	N
20	20	00:01:24	00:01:26	Bomb squad says it's all clear.	N
21	21	00:01:26	00:01:28	We'll photo-document the scene.	N
22	22	00:01:28	00:01:29	Overalls from all angles.	N
23	23	00:01:29	00:01:31	Aerials as well.	N
24	24	00:02:20	00:02:22	Guess it wasn't a sniper.	N
25	25	00:02:22	00:02:24	Fixed ammunition in the trunk.	N
26	26	00:02:24	00:02:28	The gunpowder must have heated up, and the, uh, rounds cooked off.	N
27	27	00:02:32	00:02:36	I'm going to start marking the evidence.	N
28	28	00:02:36	00:02:42	I believe the, uh, glass pressure traveled from the rear of the vehicle, through the front...	N
29	29	00:02:44	00:02:48	...and evidently separated the driver's body at the ankles.	N
30	30	00:02:49	00:02:52	David, we have body parts in the car.	N
31	31	00:02:52	00:02:54	I've been looking for the feet.	N
32	32	00:02:54	00:02:55	I found 'em.	N
33	33	00:02:55	00:02:57	We gotta ID the driver ASAP.	N
34	34	00:03:02	00:03:04	Well, the VIN number's still attached.	N
35	35	00:03:04	00:03:05	Write that down.	N
36	36	00:03:05	00:03:06	Call in the DMV.	N
37	37	00:03:06	00:03:08	Yes, sir.	N
38	38	00:03:35	00:03:37	Sorry, Catherine.	N
39	39	00:03:37	00:03:40	Traffic's backed up all the way to the Strip.	N
40	40	00:03:40	00:03:42	Got a SIG-Sauer.	N
41	41	00:03:42	00:03:44	Probably the driver's.	N
42	42	00:03:44	00:03:45	I'll start bagging.	N
43	43	00:03:45	00:03:48	Gather the detritus and separate out the bomb components.	N
44	44	00:03:48	00:03:51	Okay.	N
45	45	00:03:55	00:03:57	Here's press.	N
46	46	00:03:57	00:03:59	You're on.	N
47	47	00:03:59	00:04:02	Wish I could help, but, uh, I got a vehicle to process.	N
48	48	00:04:02	00:04:05	Come on, Grissom-- a bomb goes off these days, they're going to assume it's a hit.	N
49	49	00:04:05	00:04:07	What are you thinking?	N
50	50	00:04:07	00:04:09	I'm not thinking. I'm just looking.	N
51	51	00:04:09	00:04:11	That's good.	N
52	52	00:04:11	00:04:13	Can I use that?	N
53	53	00:04:20	00:04:24	Amelia Rueben. 25.	N
54	54	00:04:24	00:04:27	She a guest?	N
55	55	00:04:27	00:04:29	Or a guest of a guest?	N
56	56	00:04:29	00:04:30	Myles Rueben's wife.	N
57	57	00:04:30	00:04:32	Who found her?	N
58	58	00:04:32	00:04:35	About 40 minutes ago, a maid walked in for turn-down service.	N
59	59	00:04:35	00:04:37	Called hotel security.	N
60	60	00:04:37	00:04:39	Still on a timer.	N
61	61	00:04:41	00:04:45	Got a wine glass.	N
62	62	00:04:45	00:04:47	Does Myles know?	N
63	63	00:04:47	00:04:49	He's still onstage.	N
64	64	00:05:06	00:05:08	Got a wine bottle.	N
65	65	00:05:13	00:05:15	Almost empty.	N
66	66	00:05:22	00:05:23	Alcohol.	N
67	67	00:05:23	00:05:24	Hot tub.	N
68	68	00:05:24	00:05:26	A little bit too relaxed.	N
69	69	00:05:31	00:05:35	Temperature of the spa water makes liver temp irrelevant.	N
70	70	00:05:35	00:05:39	But given the redness of her eyes, I'd estimate she's been dead less than an hour.	N
71	71	00:06:00	00:06:03	It just dawned on me what's Rueben's biggest hit was.	N
72	72	00:06:04	00:06:05	What's that?	N
73	73	00:06:05	00:06:06	Amelia.	N
74	74	00:06:22	00:06:25	I'll handle this when Myles breaks for the encore.	N
75	75	00:06:25	00:06:27	Been the kid's manager since '97.	N
76	76	00:06:29	00:06:30	I should be the one to tell him.	N
77	77	00:06:44	00:06:45	How was that, Sam? Sound good?	N
78	78	00:06:45	00:06:47	Great, Myles. The best.	N
79	79	00:06:47	00:06:48	What? What's wrong?	N
80	80	00:06:48	00:06:49	I missed a high note, huh?	N
81	81	00:06:49	00:06:50	Man...	N
82	82	00:06:50	00:06:52	No, no, no. Everything sounded great.	N
83	83	00:06:52	00:06:56	Listen, Myles, these are crime scene investigators.	N
84	84	00:06:56	00:06:58	Myles, uh...	N
85	85	00:06:58	00:07:00	there's been an accident.	N
86	86	00:07:00	00:07:01	An accident?	N
87	87	00:07:01	00:07:02	What, is it my mother?	N
88	88	00:07:02	00:07:03	Did-did something happen back East?	N
89	89	00:07:03	00:07:05	No, no, no. Your mother's fine.	N
90	90	00:07:05	00:07:10	Look, Myles, it's, uh...	N
91	91	00:07:10	00:07:16	Mr. Rueben, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but your wife is dead.	N
92	92	00:07:22	00:07:24	Amelia! Amelia!	N
93	93	00:07:30	00:07:33	Turn the houselights up, Sam.	N
94	94	00:07:33	00:07:35	There's no encore tonight.	N
95	95	00:07:47	00:07:49	I heard about the bombing.	N
96	96	00:07:49	00:07:50	I'm here to help.	N
97	97	00:07:50	00:07:52	I located the seat of the explosion.	N
98	98	00:07:52	00:07:54	The bomb was attached to the fuel tank.	N
99	99	00:07:54	00:07:56	Gas-enhanced.	N
100	100	00:07:56	00:07:57	Bomber maximized his bang.	N
101	101	00:07:57	00:08:01	You really want to help, climb under here and find the initiation switch.	N
102	102	00:08:20	00:08:23	Got a stray wire.	N
103	103	00:08:25	00:08:31	Leading away from the gas tank, right into the center of the dash.	N
104	104	00:08:33	00:08:36	Nowhere near the loom.	N
105	105	00:08:41	00:08:44	The digital clock was the switch.	N
106	106	00:08:47	00:08:49	It was time-activated.	N
107	107	00:08:49	00:08:50	What's next?	N
108	108	00:08:51	00:08:53	Nick has to reconstruct the bomb.	N
109	109	00:10:06	00:10:07	It was a pipe bomb.	N
110	110	00:10:07	00:10:09	Initiated by a lightbulb filament.	N
111	111	00:10:10	00:10:11	Bomb was attached to the fuel tank.	N
112	112	00:10:11	00:10:16	There were still magnet and solder fragments attached to the pipe.	N
113	113	00:10:16	00:10:17	Did you find any kind of timing device?	N
114	114	00:10:18	00:10:20	Digital clock in the dash.	N
115	115	00:10:20	00:10:21	What about the type of explosive used?	N
116	116	00:10:22	00:10:23	Not yet.	N
117	117	00:10:23	00:10:26	I was about to analyze the chemical residue left on the bomb frags.	N
118	118	00:10:26	00:10:29	Be sure to do an organics and inorganics test.	N
119	119	00:10:29	00:10:31	Will do.	N
120	120	00:10:31	00:10:34	So...	N
121	121	00:10:34	00:10:35	what does it all mean?	N
122	122	00:10:38	00:10:39	What does what all mean?	N
123	123	00:10:39	00:10:41	Don't play dumb with me, Gil.	N
124	124	00:10:41	00:10:43	Explosions lead the news.	N
125	125	00:10:43	00:10:45	I need to know who, and I need to know why.	N
126	126	00:10:45	00:10:48	Well, the evidence is only teaching us about the bomb, not the bomber.	N
127	127	00:10:48	00:10:49	What about a signature?	N
128	128	00:10:49	00:10:52	Is there anything distinct, unusual about this particular bomb?	N
129	129	00:10:52	00:10:55	No.	N
130	130	00:10:55	00:10:57	Nothing.	N
131	131	00:11:03	00:11:05	Amelia Rueben didn't drown.	N
132	132	00:11:05	00:11:10	If she had, there'd be fluid in her nasal sinuses.	N
133	133	00:11:12	00:11:14	Clear as a bell.	N
134	134	00:11:15	00:11:17	What was the cause of death?	N
135	135	00:11:17	00:11:18	Cardiac arrest.	N
136	136	00:11:19	00:11:21	She was only 25.	N
137	137	00:11:22	00:11:23	Was there some kind of defect?	N
138	138	00:11:23	00:11:25	No, her heart was in perfect condition.	N
139	139	00:11:25	00:11:27	In fact, I have it over here.	N
140	140	00:11:29	00:11:31	See the myocardium?	N
141	141	00:11:31	00:11:34	There's no evidence of hemorrhage, infarct or scarring.	N
142	142	00:11:34	00:11:36	No coronary occlusions.	N
143	143	00:11:36	00:11:37	I can't explain it.	N
144	144	00:11:37	00:11:39	It's like a mystery of the heart.	N
145	145	00:11:42	00:11:46	So, that SIG-Sauer you found...	N
146	146	00:11:46	00:11:48	Yes. Relatively nondescript.	N
147	147	00:11:48	00:11:50	Uh, the blue stuff, sent a sample to Trace.	N
148	148	00:11:50	00:11:53	Pretty sure it's from some sort of bag that melted in the explosion.	N
149	149	00:11:53	00:11:56	Right. And the bullets from the Camaro's trunk?	N
150	150	00:11:56	00:11:57	A-ha.	N
151	151	00:11:57	00:11:58	Pre-fragmented ammo.	N
152	152	00:11:58	00:12:00	Now they're unique.	N
153	153	00:12:00	00:12:02	Exemplar's under the magnifier.	N
154	154	00:12:02	00:12:06	Copper jacket contains lead shot sealed with a clear epoxy plug.	N
155	155	00:12:06	00:12:08	I've never seen anything like that.	N
156	156	00:12:08	00:12:12	It's designed to enter a target, but not exit.	N
157	157	00:12:15	00:12:17	Penetration, not perforation.	N
158	158	00:12:17	00:12:19	Why?	N
159	159	00:12:19	00:12:21	Well, say you're on a commercial flight.	N
160	160	00:12:21	00:12:23	Plane gets hijacked.	N
161	161	00:12:23	00:12:26	US Air Marshal needs to take down the hijacker...	N
162	162	00:12:26	00:12:27	But not the plane.	N
163	163	00:12:27	00:12:31	Nowadays, MagSafes are sold commercially, but there's really not much of a market.	N
164	164	00:12:32	00:12:35	So chances are, your driver's a Federal Air Marshal.	N
165	165	00:12:38	00:12:40	It's a match.	N
166	166	00:12:40	00:12:43	Print on the hot tub dial was Sam Hopkins.	N
167	167	00:12:44	00:12:45	Rueben's manager?	N
168	168	00:12:45	00:12:47	Amelia was butt-naked in the hot tub.	N
169	169	00:12:47	00:12:49	What was he doing in her room tweaking dials?	N
170	170	00:12:49	00:12:50	While her husband's onstage?	N
171	171	00:12:51	00:12:53	Spectroscopy just got back.	N
172	172	00:12:53	00:12:56	Hydrofluoric acid in her system.	N
173	173	00:12:56	00:12:57	Isn't that an industrial solvent?	N
174	174	00:12:57	00:12:59	High-powered stuff.	N
175	175	00:12:59	00:13:05	Mainly used to remove rust, clean glass, brighten aluminum, dissolve silicas... and commit murder.	N
176	176	00:13:05	00:13:06	She was poisoned.	N
177	177	00:13:06	00:13:09	That would explain her heart attack.	N
178	178	00:13:09	00:13:10	You're killing me, Jimmy.	N
179	179	00:13:10	00:13:12	You're killing me.	N
180	180	00:13:12	00:13:13	All night the spotlight was off.	N
181	181	00:13:13	00:13:14	Way too hot on his face.	N
182	182	00:13:14	00:13:15	It's too hot on me right now.	N
183	183	00:13:16	00:13:17	They guy's not Wayne Newton, all right?	N
184	184	00:13:17	00:13:19	Can you see it on my face, Jim?	N
185	185	00:13:19	00:13:20	I need... Jimmy.	N
186	186	00:13:20	00:13:24	Thank... I need a cast shadow on him for all the love songs.	N
187	187	00:13:24	00:13:26	Mr. Hopkins, could you answer the question, please.	N
188	188	00:13:26	00:13:28	Sorry.	N
189	189	00:13:28	00:13:29	Yes, I was in Amelia's room.	N
190	190	00:13:29	00:13:30	I'm in there all the time.	N
191	191	00:13:30	00:13:31	We're like family.	N
192	192	00:13:31	00:13:32	We know you were close.	N
193	193	00:13:32	00:13:35	Do you always turn on the hot tub for her?	N
194	194	00:13:35	00:13:38	I represent one of the biggest headliners in town.	N
195	195	00:13:39	00:13:42	Manager, marriage counselor, confidante.	N
196	196	00:13:42	00:13:44	I kept Myles happy by keeping her happy.	N
197	197	00:13:44	00:13:48	Amelia, anything else I can get for you?	N
198	198	00:13:49	00:13:51	Look, sweetheart.	N
199	199	00:13:51	00:13:53	Here's how this works.	N
200	200	00:13:53	00:13:57	You give him his space, he sings his heart out.	N
201	201	00:13:57	00:13:59	Honey, we all prosper.	N
202	202	00:13:59	00:14:04	Let me set up a dinner for you two-- quiet, alone-- after the show.	N
203	203	00:14:04	00:14:05	No work.	N
204	204	00:14:05	00:14:07	Never happen.	N
205	205	00:14:07	00:14:09	Relax.	N
206	206	00:14:09	00:14:10	Give me an hour.	N
207	207	00:14:14	00:14:19	But you must admit, the boss' wife, naked in a hot tub, looks kind of funky.	N
208	208	00:14:19	00:14:20	Look at me.	N
209	209	00:14:20	00:14:22	Do I look like a threat?	N
210	210	00:14:22	00:14:25	The reason I've succeeded in this business, I don't squat where I eat, you know what I mean?	N
211	211	00:14:25	00:14:27	All right, let's talk about drinking.	N
212	212	00:14:27	00:14:28	There was a bottle of wine found near the tub.	N
213	213	00:14:28	00:14:30	Did you have a drink with her?	N
214	214	00:14:30	00:14:31	No. Never.	N
215	215	00:14:31	00:14:32	I don't touch it.	N
216	216	00:14:32	00:14:33	I'm on call 24/7.	N
217	217	00:14:33	00:14:36	Myles can pick up the phone, have me do anything, anytime.	N
218	218	00:14:36	00:14:38	Fly to L.A., pick someone up at the airport.	N
219	219	00:14:38	00:14:40	So, you'd do just about anything for him then?	N
220	220	00:14:40	00:14:41	When it comes to Myles, yeah.	N
221	221	00:14:41	00:14:43	What's this all about?	N
222	222	00:14:43	00:14:45	Mr. Hopkins, Amelia didn't drown.	N
223	223	00:14:45	00:14:46	She was poisoned.	N
224	224	00:14:46	00:14:48	Poisoned? By who?	N
225	225	00:14:48	00:14:50	That's what we're trying to find out.	N
226	226	00:14:50	00:14:54	According to the DMV, the Camaro was one of yours, is that right?	N
227	227	00:14:54	00:14:56	Yeah, it was rented to an Adam Watson.	N
228	228	00:14:56	00:14:57	Waived insurance.	N
229	229	00:14:58	00:14:59	Government discount.	N
230	230	00:14:59	00:15:03	Well, we have reason to believe Mr. Watson was a US Air Marshal.	N
231	231	00:15:03	00:15:05	Right. How could I forget him?	N
232	232	00:15:05	00:15:08	He threw it in my face when I told him we were out of compacts.	N
233	233	00:15:08	00:15:10	I'm a US Air Marshal, okay?	N
234	234	00:15:10	00:15:12	I travel for a living.	N
235	235	00:15:12	00:15:13	I don't need this crap.	N
236	236	00:15:13	00:15:15	But you found him a car.	N
237	237	00:15:15	00:15:19	I'll put you in a full-size and won't charge you for the difference.	N
238	238	00:15:19	00:15:20	No, forget it. I'll take the Camaro.	N
239	239	00:15:20	00:15:22	What time was that?	N
240	240	00:15:22	00:15:24	31 p.m.	N
241	241	00:15:24	00:15:27	Mr. Watson drove out nine minutes later.	N
242	242	00:15:27	00:15:29	Thanks a lot.	N
243	243	00:15:29	00:15:31	Guy worked for Homeland Security.	N
244	244	00:15:31	00:15:33	You think maybe some terrorist blew him up?	N
245	245	00:15:33	00:15:36	You'll be the first to know.	N
246	246	00:15:37	00:15:39	Well, it's been confirmed.	N
247	247	00:15:39	00:15:43	The driver, Adam Watson, was a Federal Air Marshal.	N
248	248	00:15:43	00:15:45	So, one of us needs to call the sheriff.	N
249	249	00:15:45	00:15:47	I'll flip you for it.	N
250	250	00:15:47	00:15:50	Well, before we make that call, what time did the Air Marshal drive off the lot?	N
251	251	00:15:51	00:15:53	40. Why?	N
252	252	00:15:53	00:15:56	Well, the bomb went off 30 minutes later.	N
253	253	00:15:56	00:15:58	It takes that long to get from here to the Orpheus.	N
254	254	00:15:58	00:16:01	So you're saying the bomb was already in the car when he drove out?	N
255	255	00:16:01	00:16:03	Well, that can't be.	N
256	256	00:16:03	00:16:08	According to the manager, the Camaro was only in the lot for, uh, nine minutes.	N
257	257	00:16:08	00:16:11	Well, it takes longer than that to hard-wire a bomb.	N
258	258	00:16:11	00:16:15	Which can only mean that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned.	N
259	259	00:16:15	00:16:18	So, who rented the car before him?	N
260	260	00:16:18	00:16:20	Roger Dunbar! Open up!	N
261	261	00:16:20	00:16:21	Las Vegas Police!	N
262	262	00:16:28	00:16:30	Clear.	N
263	263	00:16:30	00:16:31	Stand down.	N
264	264	00:16:31	00:16:33	Good job, guys.	N
265	265	00:16:34	00:16:36	Okay, well.	N
266	266	00:16:37	00:16:40	This guy was obviously on a week-to-week lease.	N
267	267	00:16:48	00:16:50	Left some clothes behind...	N
268	268	00:16:50	00:16:52	and a paper shredder.	N
269	269	00:16:58	00:17:00	No sign of any bomb-making material.	N
270	270	00:17:00	00:17:01	I'll go check the garage.	N
271	271	00:17:44	00:17:51	Dr. Amerian, 4 Oh, today.	N
272	272	00:17:51	00:17:53	I'll make an appointment.	N
273	273	00:17:56	00:17:59	You drag me out of my dentist's office.	N
274	274	00:17:59	00:18:01	You throw me in a squad car.	N
275	275	00:18:01	00:18:04	Now you're accusing me of planting a car bomb?	N
276	276	00:18:04	00:18:07	Mr. Dunbar, you rented a Camaro from Thrift Rite Rental.	N
277	277	00:18:07	00:18:10	30 p.m.	N
278	278	00:18:10	00:18:12	It blew up a half an hour later in front of the Orpheus.	N
279	279	00:18:12	00:18:14	It's all over the news.	N
280	280	00:18:14	00:18:16	That was my Camaro?	N
281	281	00:18:16	00:18:18	Yes.	N
282	282	00:18:18	00:18:19	But this is crazy.	N
283	283	00:18:19	00:18:21	So, what happened?	N
284	284	00:18:21	00:18:23	You have a beef with the rental car company?	N
285	285	00:18:23	00:18:26	No. I-I get double miles.	N
286	286	00:18:26	00:18:27	I'm a Premier Card member.	N
287	287	00:18:27	00:18:29	Oh, I'm sure you are.	N
288	288	00:18:29	00:18:33	You know what, I'm not saying another word without an attorney.	N
289	289	00:18:33	00:18:35	That's your right, Mr. Dunbar.	N
290	290	00:18:37	00:18:38	Warrant for your clothes.	N
291	291	00:18:40	00:18:42	Strip.	N
292	292	00:18:42	00:18:44	Everything in the bag.	N
293	293	00:19:33	00:19:35	ID'd the explosive.	N
294	294	00:19:36	00:19:37	Ammonium perchlorate.	N
295	295	00:19:37	00:19:38	Yeah, rocket fuel.	N
296	296	00:19:38	00:19:42	GCMS picked up the other half of the equation-- gasoline.	N
297	297	00:19:42	00:19:46	Combination of the two creates an unstable mass.	N
298	298	00:19:46	00:19:48	Both shock- and friction-sensitive.	N
299	299	00:19:48	00:19:52	Ammonium perchlorate's available at any chemical supply store.	N
300	300	00:19:52	00:19:54	You can gas up on every corner.	N
301	301	00:19:54	00:19:56	Anyone could've made this bomb.	N
302	302	00:19:58	00:20:01	Sheriff?	N
303	303	00:20:01	00:20:03	What can we do for you?	N
304	304	00:20:03	00:20:04	Need a little clarification.	N
305	305	00:20:04	00:20:07	I know Captain Brass has a suspect in custody.	N
306	306	00:20:07	00:20:12	Where it get a little hazy for me, is I'm not getting his connection to the Air Marshal.	N
307	307	00:20:12	00:20:16	Well, it's entirely possible that Mr. Watson was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.	N
308	308	00:20:16	00:20:20	Another thing, you said that the switch was a digital clock.	N
309	309	00:20:20	00:20:24	The bomb had been set to go off at a designated time, right?	N
310	310	00:20:24	00:20:26	How do we get a wrong time?	N
311	311	00:20:26	00:20:28	I can answer that, too.	N
312	312	00:20:28	00:20:29	Take a look.	N
313	313	00:20:36	00:20:38	Short in the wire.	N
314	314	00:20:38	00:20:41	Compromised the timing device.	N
315	315	00:20:41	00:20:42	Made the bomb unpredictable.	N
316	316	00:20:42	00:20:45	We may never know when that bomb was supposed to explode.	N
317	317	00:20:47	00:20:49	I got your page.	N
318	318	00:20:50	00:20:52	You'd be a good maitre d'.	N
319	319	00:20:52	00:20:54	Checking glassware for spots?	N
320	320	00:20:54	00:20:56	You know, a hot tub is just like a dishwasher.	N
321	321	00:20:56	00:20:58	Washes away all of the impurities.	N
322	322	00:20:58	00:21:00	Including hydrofluoric acid, huh?	N
323	323	00:21:02	00:21:03	'93 Pinot.	N
324	324	00:21:04	00:21:06	Either it was a bad year for wine or a bad year for Amelia.	N
325	325	00:21:07	00:21:10	I found trace amounts of hydrofluoric acid in the vino.	N
326	326	00:21:10	00:21:12	So, somebody did spike the wine.	N
327	327	00:21:12	00:21:14	Oui.	N
328	328	00:21:14	00:21:16	We just want to know what happened the other night.	N
329	329	00:21:16	00:21:17	Did you open the bottle for her?	N
330	330	00:21:17	00:21:18	Hey, Amelia requested me.	N
331	331	00:21:18	00:21:19	I was up there every night.	N
332	332	00:21:20	00:21:21	I hooked her up.	N
333	333	00:21:21	00:21:23	And she wasn't drinking no Italian rotgut either.	N
334	334	00:21:23	00:21:26	She was ordering '93 Pinot from Russian River Valley.	N
335	335	00:21:26	00:21:28	That's 350 a bottle, 20% delivery charge.	N
336	336	00:21:28	00:21:30	You do the math.	N
337	337	00:21:30	00:21:31	Was anyone there with her?	N
338	338	00:21:31	00:21:32	No.	N
339	339	00:21:32	00:21:33	What about Sam Hopkins?	N
340	340	00:21:34	00:21:35	No, that mutt wasn't there.	N
341	341	00:21:35	00:21:36	Mutt?	N
342	342	00:21:36	00:21:37	Yeah, that manager scumbag.	N
343	343	00:21:37	00:21:39	You bring a bottle of wine when he's there, forget about it.	N
344	344	00:21:39	00:21:41	He signs for the bill and stiff city.	N
345	345	00:21:41	00:21:44	Now, when the Prince of Soul is there, that's a different story.	N
346	346	00:21:44	00:21:45	He'd give you $500 just to get lost.	N
347	347	00:21:45	00:21:47	But you didn't see Myles the other night?	N
348	348	00:21:47	00:21:48	Yeah, I saw him for a sec.	N
349	349	00:21:48	00:21:49	He came in between shows.	N
350	350	00:21:49	00:21:50	He showed me the door.	N
351	351	00:21:55	00:21:55	Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man.	N
352	352	00:21:55	00:22:01	There's only one man who practices chivalry around here, and it ain't you, Ducky.	N
353	353	00:22:04	00:22:07	Hey, I could tell they were in love, you know?	N
354	354	00:22:07	00:22:08	But he was never around.	N
355	355	00:22:08	00:22:10	I mean, I felt bad for Amelia.	N
356	356	00:22:10	00:22:12	She'd have me up three, four times a night.	N
357	357	00:22:12	00:22:13	You forgot the fork.	N
358	358	00:22:14	00:22:15	Can you bring some salt? How about some ice?	N
359	359	00:22:15	00:22:20	If you ask me, I'd say she was lonely.	N
360	360	00:22:20	00:22:22	Did you ever see them fight?	N
361	361	00:22:22	00:22:23	No, but I heard 'em.	N
362	362	00:22:23	00:22:26	And I'm sure 2202 and 2206 heard 'em, too.	N
363	363	00:22:26	00:22:29	Hey, but I don't bite the hand that feeds me.	N
364	364	00:22:29	00:22:32	Thanks.	Y
365	365	00:22:45	00:22:47	There was rocket fuel in the bomb and rocket fuel on your T-shirt.	N
366	366	00:22:49	00:22:51	That you need to explain.	Y
367	367	00:22:51	00:22:58	Well, I'm not really sure, but my son, he's got this science project due.	Y
368	368	00:22:58	00:23:01	You're right, I'm not supposed to help, but, really, all the parents do.	Y
369	369	00:23:02	00:23:04	We made a volcano.	N
370	370	00:23:04	00:23:08	Spilled some of the chemicals.	N
371	371	00:23:13	00:23:15	We've been to your apartment.	Y
372	372	00:23:15	00:23:17	What volcano? What kid?	Y
373	373	00:23:17	00:23:18	Timmy. Third grade.	Y
374	374	00:23:18	00:23:19	Mesquite Elementary.	Y
375	375	00:23:19	00:23:20	You're divorced?	N
376	376	00:23:20	00:23:22	No.	Y
377	377	00:23:22	00:23:30	No, well, look, here's the situation is the family, they live in Mesquite, and I'm there on the weekends.	Y
378	378	00:23:30	00:23:31	And during the week?	Y
379	379	00:23:31	00:23:35	I-I'm in sales, so I travel all over the country.	Y
380	380	00:23:35	00:23:37	Which is why he rents a car when he's in town.	N
381	381	00:23:37	00:23:38	It's cheaper than leasing.	N
382	382	00:23:38	00:23:40	Cheaper.	N
383	383	00:23:40	00:23:43	All right, but it still doesn't explain the empty apartment.	N
384	384	00:23:43	00:23:46	Look, I... like being married.	N
385	385	00:23:47	00:23:56	I... love my wife, my kid, but... I need my space.	N
386	386	00:23:56	00:24:03	I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I just tell them that I'm out of town even when I'm not.	N
387	387	00:24:03	00:24:07	We're going to need your home address.	N
388	388	00:24:07	00:24:08	No, look...	N
389	389	00:24:08	00:24:10	I'm begging you.	N
390	390	00:24:10	00:24:13	Please don't blow things for me with the wife.	N
391	391	00:24:17	00:24:19	Mom, what's going on?	N
392	392	00:24:20	00:24:22	I don't understand.	N
393	393	00:24:22	00:24:25	Mrs. Dunbar, could you and your son wait outside, please?	N
394	394	00:24:25	00:24:26	Ma'am, come with me.	N
395	395	00:24:26	00:24:28	I'll fill you in.	N
396	396	00:24:55	00:24:58	Catherine, there is a volcano on the table.	Y
397	397	00:25:05	00:25:08	Aluminum powder.	Y
398	398	00:25:08	00:25:11	Polyvinylbutadiene.	N
399	399	00:25:15	00:25:17	Ammonium perchlorate.	N
400	400	00:25:17	00:25:21	The three ingredients to make lava flow.	Y
401	401	00:25:21	00:25:25	In fifth grade, I built one of these as my science fair project.	Y
402	402	00:25:25	00:25:26	It was awesome.	N
403	403	00:25:26	00:25:28	First place should've been mine.	N
404	404	00:25:28	00:25:34	But they ended up giving it to this kid with some lame red ant colony.	N
405	405	00:25:35	00:25:37	That was you.	Y
406	406	00:25:37	00:25:38	Yeah, only my ants were Black Argentinians.	Y
407	407	00:25:39	00:25:40	Uh-huh.	N
408	408	00:25:40	00:25:43	I learned at a very early age that the bugs always win.	N
409	409	00:25:43	00:25:45	Right.	N
410	410	00:25:47	00:25:50	Trust me, Roger didn't build a bomb.	Y
411	411	00:25:50	00:25:52	I love my husband, but he's inept.	N
412	412	00:25:52	00:25:55	Just last week, the hose bib cracked.	N
413	413	00:25:55	00:25:56	Front yard was a river.	N
414	414	00:25:57	00:25:59	Roger was helpless till I got home.	N
415	415	00:25:59	00:26:00	Well, what about that volcano?	N
416	416	00:26:00	00:26:04	Your husband said that he helped your son build it.	N
417	417	00:26:04	00:26:05	He watched.	N
418	418	00:26:05	00:26:07	I'm a teacher.	Y
419	419	00:26:07	00:26:09	Timmy knows which parent to go to for help.	N
420	420	00:26:09	00:26:13	Mrs. Dunbar, your husband told us that he was in sales.	N
421	421	00:26:15	00:26:16	He's with the State Department.	N
422	422	00:26:16	00:26:21	You know, all that sensitive government stuff.	N
423	423	00:26:21	00:26:23	Keeps him on the road.	N
424	424	00:26:23	00:26:24	He doesn't say much about it.	N
425	425	00:26:24	00:26:29	As far as you know, has he talked about his job with anyone else?	N
426	426	00:26:29	00:26:31	Any other family members? Friends?	N
427	427	00:26:31	00:26:32	His parents are dead.	N
428	428	00:26:32	00:26:33	Roger's an only child.	N
429	429	00:26:33	00:26:37	He doesn't have time for friends.	N
430	430	00:26:37	00:26:40	There was this one night, years ago.	N
431	431	00:26:40	00:26:43	We were both a little drunk and...	N
432	432	00:26:43	00:26:47	Roger confessed he was CIA.	N
433	433	00:26:54	00:26:57	Hey, I made one of those in third grade.	N
434	434	00:26:57	00:27:00	Science fair.	N
435	435	00:27:00	00:27:01	Should have won, too.	N
436	436	00:27:01	00:27:02	Got to let it go, Nick.	N
437	437	00:27:03	00:27:06	Bomb end-cap with tool marks.	N
438	438	00:27:06	00:27:11	Given the orientation and spread of the marks, consistent with pliers, vise-grips.	N
439	439	00:27:11	00:27:14	There were no vise-grips in the Dunbars' toolbox.	N
440	440	00:27:14	00:27:19	But given that the bomb and the volcano were similarly constructed...	N
441	441	00:27:19	00:27:22	We can compare the tool marks on both end-caps.	N
442	442	00:27:22	00:27:25	Doesn't matter what you make; it's what you make it with.	N
443	443	00:27:35	00:27:36	Not even close.	N
444	444	00:27:36	00:27:37	Mm-mm.	N
445	445	00:27:37	00:27:43	So, whatever tool made the volcano did not make the bomb.	N
446	446	00:27:43	00:27:48	Okay, I reconstructed the contents of the paper shredder.	N
447	447	00:27:48	00:27:49	Five bills.	N
448	448	00:27:49	00:27:50	All in Roger Dunbar's name.	N
449	449	00:27:50	00:27:53	Addressed to 2175 La Pressa.	N
450	450	00:27:53	00:27:56	Mm-hmm. His apartment.	N
451	451	00:27:56	00:27:58	Okay, top two are credit card bills.	N
452	452	00:27:58	00:27:59	Both VISA.	N
453	453	00:27:59	00:28:01	Separate accounts.	N
454	454	00:28:01	00:28:03	Roger A. Dunbar.	N
455	455	00:28:03	00:28:05	Roger B. Dunbar.	N
456	456	00:28:05	00:28:07	That's an easy way to separate out expenses.	N
457	457	00:28:07	00:28:09	Check out the gas bills.	N
458	458	00:28:09	00:28:10	Three different meters.	N
459	459	00:28:11	00:28:14	2175 La Pressa.	N
460	460	00:28:14	00:28:17	822 Devon, Mesquite.	N
461	461	00:28:17	00:28:20	1845 Galewood, Henderson.	N
462	462	00:28:20	00:28:25	Hey, got the DNA results back from that bloody Band-Aid that Grissom found at Dunbar's apartment.	N
463	463	00:28:25	00:28:27	Compared it to his DNA. Not a match.	N
464	464	00:28:27	00:28:29	But I did find seven alleles in common.	N
465	465	00:28:29	00:28:31	His son.	N
466	466	00:28:31	00:28:32	No. It's female.	N
467	467	00:28:32	00:28:34	Mother, sister, daughter.	N
468	468	00:28:34	00:28:38	Well, according to his wife, his mother's deceased.	N
469	469	00:28:39	00:28:41	He's an only child.	N
470	470	00:28:41	00:28:43	So, that leaves a daughter.	N
471	471	00:28:43	00:28:46	Well, there's no way there was a kid at that apartment.	N
472	472	00:28:46	00:28:48	Well, maybe she was living in Henderson.	N
473	473	00:28:48	00:28:51	Forget secret agent.	N
474	474	00:28:51	00:28:54	Roger Dunbar was living a secret life.	N
475	475	00:29:03	00:29:04	Can I help you?	N
476	476	00:29:07	00:29:09	Good evening.	N
477	477	00:29:09	00:29:11	We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
478	478	00:29:11	00:29:13	Oh, God.	N
479	479	00:29:13	00:29:16	Did something happen to my husband?	N
480	480	00:29:16	00:29:17	He was supposed to be home on Monday night.	N
481	481	00:29:17	00:29:19	I've been calling his cell. He's not at work.	N
482	482	00:29:20	00:29:22	Is this your husband?	N
483	483	00:29:22	00:29:23	Yes.	N
484	484	00:29:23	00:29:24	You're currently married to him?	N
485	485	00:29:25	00:29:26	Yes. What is going on?	N
486	486	00:29:28	00:29:31	Well, your husband is a suspect in a criminal investigation.	N
487	487	00:29:31	00:29:33	Currently, he's in police custody.	N
488	488	00:29:35	00:29:37	Mrs. Dunbar?	N
489	489	00:29:38	00:29:41	Do you have a daughter?	N
490	490	00:29:41	00:29:42	Amy.	N
491	491	00:29:42	00:29:46	Is she entered in the science fair?	N
492	492	00:29:47	00:29:49	You can't take it.	N
493	493	00:29:50	00:29:54	Amy, did you use this the tool to work on the inside of your volcano?	N
494	494	00:29:54	00:29:55	Yeah, my dad did.	N
495	495	00:29:55	00:29:57	He helped you build it?	N
496	496	00:29:57	00:29:59	Yeah.	N
497	497	00:29:59	00:30:00	I teach yoga.	N
498	498	00:30:00	00:30:02	I have no idea how this works.	N
499	499	00:30:02	00:30:04	It was all Roger.	N
500	500	00:30:04	00:30:06	When's your science fair?	N
501	501	00:30:06	00:30:07	Friday.	N
502	502	00:30:08	00:30:12	Well, we'll do our best to get this back to you by Friday, okay?	N
503	503	00:30:12	00:30:13	Okay.	N
504	504	00:30:15	00:30:17	Which side do you want?	N
505	505	00:30:17	00:30:19	I'll take the west wing.	N
506	506	00:30:19	00:30:22	It's a nice place.	N
507	507	00:30:22	00:30:23	Uh-huh.	N
508	508	00:30:30	00:30:35	You could record a whole album in this studio.	N
509	509	00:30:35	00:30:37	This guy's got it made.	N
510	510	00:30:38	00:30:41	The life of a celebrity.	N
511	511	00:30:55	00:30:58	I don't know, I think it sounds kind of isolating, living in a fishbowl.	N
512	512	00:30:58	00:30:59	Wouldn't be isolated.	N
513	513	00:30:59	00:31:03	You'd have a butler, a maid service, laundry service.	N
514	514	00:31:04	00:31:06	Sheet music.	N
515	515	00:31:06	00:31:08	Guy writes his own stuff.	N
516	516	00:31:13	00:31:15	Dishwashing gloves.	N
517	517	00:31:15	00:31:18	Dry erase markers.	N
518	518	00:31:18	00:31:21	Slate Industrial Glass Cleaner.	N
519	519	00:31:21	00:31:25	The ingredients-- distilled water and hydrofluoric acid.	N
520	520	00:31:27	00:31:29	Fatal if swallowed.	N
521	521	00:31:32	00:31:36	You're sure you want to waive your right to an attorney?	N
522	522	00:31:36	00:31:39	I got nothin' to hide.	N
523	523	00:31:39	00:31:41	Do you recognize this product?	N
524	524	00:31:43	00:31:45	Yeah.	N
525	525	00:31:45	00:31:46	I use it to clean my windows.	N
526	526	00:31:46	00:31:49	Don't you have a maid or someone to do that for you?	N
527	527	00:31:49	00:31:51	I write songs late at night.	N
528	528	00:31:51	00:31:53	Windows are my chalkboard.	N
529	529	00:32:00	00:32:01	Mr. Rueben...	N
530	530	00:32:02	00:32:03	your wife was poisoned.	N
531	531	00:32:04	00:32:06	We suspect window cleaner was slipped into her wine.	N
532	532	00:32:07	00:32:07	It can't be.	N
533	533	00:32:08	00:32:08	I was there.	N
534	534	00:32:09	00:32:10	I opened that wine.	N
535	535	00:32:10	00:32:12	Did you have a fight?	N
536	536	00:32:12	00:32:13	Not lately.	N
537	537	00:32:13	00:32:15	But you have had fights in the past.	N
538	538	00:32:16	00:32:17	Who doesn't?	N
539	539	00:32:17	00:32:23	I mean, fighting, loving, laughing... it all comes from the same place, man.	N
540	540	00:32:23	00:32:24	It's passion.	N
541	541	00:32:24	00:32:27	And we loved each other passionately.	N
542	542	00:32:31	00:32:34	When we met, it was fate.	N
543	543	00:32:34	00:32:36	But you know what I need right now?	N
544	544	00:32:36	00:32:37	I need a woman.	N
545	545	00:32:37	00:32:41	I need a woman to come up here and be my inspiration.	N
546	546	00:32:42	00:32:43	You, baby.	N
547	547	00:32:43	00:32:45	Second row. Come on up here.	N
548	548	00:33:02	00:33:04	I was looking for love.	N
549	549	00:33:04	00:33:07	She was looking for the same thing.	N
550	550	00:33:07	00:33:09	She loved my music.	N
551	551	00:33:11	00:33:13	I loved her smile.	Y
552	552	00:33:13	00:33:17	It's hard being on top, you know?	Y
553	553	00:33:18	00:33:20	I mean, everybody loves you.	Y
554	554	00:33:20	00:33:22	Wants their piece.	N
555	555	00:33:24	00:33:26	That's why we fought.	N
556	556	00:33:26	00:33:28	The time.	N
557	557	00:33:31	00:33:34	She knew she could never have me to herself.	N
558	558	00:33:36	00:33:39	Look, I got sound check for the late show in an hour.	N
559	559	00:33:39	00:33:40	Can I go?	N
560	560	00:33:40	00:33:41	Sure.	N
561	561	00:33:44	00:33:47	We might want to talk to you later.	N
562	562	00:33:51	00:33:54	Wife's been dead less than 48 hours.	N
563	563	00:33:54	00:33:57	Well, there's a man who definitely has his priorities straight.	N
564	564	00:33:57	00:34:01	Okay, three people have admitted to being with Amelia the night that she died.	Y
565	565	00:34:01	00:34:04	The room service waiter, Myles, and Myles's manager.	N
566	566	00:34:04	00:34:05	Room service guy's out.	N
567	567	00:34:05	00:34:07	He left before the cork was popped.	N
568	568	00:34:07	00:34:15	So, did Myles kill Amelia and the manager's covering for him or did the manager kill Amelia and Myles doesn't have a clue?	N
569	569	00:34:15	00:34:18	Bigamy is a Class D Felony.	N
570	570	00:34:18	00:34:23	If convicted, you could be sentenced from one to four years in prison, do you know that?	N
571	571	00:34:23	00:34:25	I'd just married Beth, when I met Debbie.	N
572	572	00:34:26	00:34:27	She was a student.	N
573	573	00:34:27	00:34:29	UNLV.	N
574	574	00:34:30	00:34:31	She got pregnant.	N
575	575	00:34:31	00:34:33	I did the right thing.	Y
576	576	00:34:33	00:34:41	Ever since, it's been Monday through Friday with Debbie and weekends with Beth.	Y
577	577	00:34:41	00:34:43	They both think I travel for a living.	Y
578	578	00:34:43	00:34:47	I know I keep coming back to this, but, uh... I mean, I got to ask you.	N
579	579	00:34:47	00:34:49	What's with the empty apartment?	N
580	580	00:34:49	00:34:52	Do you have a girlfriend on the side as well?	N
581	581	00:34:52	00:34:53	No.	N
582	582	00:34:56	00:34:57	Just tell them the truth.	N
583	583	00:35:01	00:35:05	My life is really a balancing act.	Y
584	584	00:35:05	00:35:09	Early on, I took Debbie to dinner and Beth saw it on a credit card statement.	N
585	585	00:35:09	00:35:17	So instead of a P.O. Box, I figured why not rent a cheap apartment, you know?	Y
586	586	00:35:17	00:35:20	Have a night to myself once in a while.	N
587	587	00:35:20	00:35:25	We found a Band-Aid with your daughter Amy's blood at your apartment.	N
588	588	00:35:25	00:35:29	So, you bring your daughter there, but not your wives?	Y
589	589	00:35:29	00:35:31	Oh, no. It's not like that.	Y
590	590	00:35:32	00:35:34	You know how kids are.	N
591	591	00:35:34	00:35:35	Dad, take this.	N
592	592	00:35:35	00:35:37	It keeps falling off.	Y
593	593	00:35:40	00:35:43	I emptied my pockets at the apartment.	N
594	594	00:35:43	00:35:49	Mr. Dunbar, we collected both of your children's volcanoes and supplies.	N
595	595	00:35:49	00:35:54	And we found a pair of pliers at your home in Henderson.	N
596	596	00:35:54	00:35:57	Those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes.	N
597	597	00:35:57	00:35:58	That's right.	N
598	598	00:35:58	00:36:03	I needed pliers in Henderson, so I borrowed Beth's pliers from Mesquite.	N
599	599	00:36:03	00:36:04	There's no crime in that.	N
600	600	00:36:04	00:36:07	I'm just really confused.	N
601	601	00:36:07	00:36:14	Um... your wife, Beth, told us that you couldn't build a volcano to save your soul.	N
602	602	00:36:14	00:36:19	Yet your wife, Debbie, claims that it was all you that made your daughter's volcano.	N
603	603	00:36:19	00:36:20	So, what is it?	N
604	604	00:36:20	00:36:24	Well, I watched Beth when she made Timmy's volcano.	N
605	605	00:36:24	00:36:28	So, then when Amy had a science project, I knew the drill.	N
606	606	00:36:28	00:36:36	Now, granted, it wasn't as symmetrical as Beth's and the lava flow was a little anemic, but... Amy liked it.	N
607	607	00:36:36	00:36:38	When did you borrow those pliers?	N
608	608	00:36:38	00:36:39	I don't know.	N
609	609	00:36:39	00:36:41	Couple weeks ago.	N
610	610	00:36:41	00:36:42	Why?	N
611	611	00:36:42	00:36:45	You never returned them to your wife, Beth?	N
612	612	00:36:47	00:36:50	I've been meaning to do that.	N
613	613	00:36:55	00:36:58	Same characteristics. We got a match.	N
614	614	00:37:00	00:37:01	Take her in.	N
615	615	00:37:28	00:37:30	I got prints.	N
616	616	00:37:30	00:37:32	I've got burns.	N
617	617	00:37:32	00:37:34	You first.	N
618	618	00:37:34	00:37:35	Sam or Myles?	N
619	619	00:37:35	00:37:37	Amelia's.	N
620	620	00:37:44	00:37:45	Well, you're just in time.	N
621	621	00:37:45	00:37:46	She gets shipped in an hour.	N
622	622	00:37:46	00:37:48	This should just take a second.	N
623	623	00:37:48	00:37:50	Could you give me her right hand, please?	N
624	624	00:37:57	00:37:58	Three acid burns.	N
625	625	00:37:58	00:38:01	This is not a murder.	N
626	626	00:38:01	00:38:02	It's a suicide.	N
627	627	00:38:32	00:38:35	I knew she wasn't happy.	Y
628	628	00:38:35	00:38:37	I guess I just didn't pay attention.	Y
629	629	00:38:37	00:38:39	You shouldn't blame yourself for this.	N
630	630	00:38:39	00:38:41	Shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I?	N
631	631	00:38:41	00:38:45	I spend most of my time making them happy.	Y
632	632	00:38:45	00:38:46	I never...	N
633	633	00:38:46	00:38:48	I never took the time to make her happy.	N
634	634	00:38:48	00:38:51	Amelia, Amelia!	N
635	635	00:38:53	00:38:54	What do you want to do, kid?	N
636	636	00:39:00	00:39:02	The show must go on, right?	N
637	637	00:39:02	00:39:04	It's your call.	Y
638	638	00:39:47	00:39:50	We found these pliers in your car's glove box.	Y
639	639	00:39:51	00:39:54	You used them to fix the faucet.	N
640	640	00:39:54	00:39:56	And to...	N
641	641	00:39:56	00:39:58	make a bomb.	N
642	642	00:40:00	00:40:01	Mrs. Dunbar...	N
643	643	00:40:01	00:40:05	how long have you known about Roger's double life?	N
644	644	00:40:06	00:40:10	His other wife's name is Debbie.	N
645	645	00:40:10	00:40:13	Once or twice a year he'd call me by that name.	N
646	646	00:40:13	00:40:14	I ignored it.	N
647	647	00:40:14	00:40:18	It's very difficult for two people to live a lie, let alone three.	N
648	648	00:40:18	00:40:21	Look, when Roger and I were together, he was a good husband.	N
649	649	00:40:21	00:40:22	Terrific father.	N
650	650	00:40:22	00:40:29	It was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon.	N
651	651	00:40:29	00:40:31	Really?	N
652	652	00:40:31	00:40:33	So what changed?	N
653	653	00:40:33	00:40:36	He asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car.	N
654	654	00:40:38	00:40:43	There was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano.	N
655	655	00:40:43	00:40:47	Including the stars I had hand-cut for my son.	N
656	656	00:40:50	00:40:56	I'd always suspected there was another woman, but never...	N
657	657	00:40:56	00:40:59	another family.	N
658	658	00:41:01	00:41:05	Two weeks ago Sunday, I followed him.	N
659	659	00:41:05	00:41:09	He, uh, dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building.	N
660	660	00:41:09	00:41:17	Then he changed his clothes, and got into a nicer car, and drove out to Henderson.	N
661	661	00:41:17	00:41:20	Why didn't you just leave him? Turn him in?	N
662	662	00:41:22	00:41:24	He made a fool out of me.	N
663	663	00:41:25	00:41:27	A mockery of our life.	N
664	664	00:41:27	00:41:30	Mrs. Dunbar, you killed three innocent people.	N
665	665	00:41:30	00:41:34	That was never my intention.	N
666	666	00:41:34	00:41:37	30.	N
667	667	00:41:37	00:41:39	On his way to the airport.	N
668	668	00:41:41	00:41:43	Why a bomb?	N
669	669	00:41:43	00:41:47	It, it's not much harder to make a bomb than a volcano.	N
