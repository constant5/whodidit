7	00:00:49	00:00:52	Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink...!
8	00:00:52	00:01:53	(woman moaning ecstatically Sorry, no ID.
9	00:01:53	00:01:57	It's okay. Brass has a line on the resident director.
10	00:01:57	00:01:59	Lanie!
11	00:01:59	00:02:01	Oh, my God, no!
12	00:02:01	00:02:04	My God, Lanie, I can't believe it. You really did it.
13	00:02:04	00:02:06	Hey! Let her on through.
14	00:02:08	00:02:09	Monica!
15	00:02:10	00:02:11	Lanie!
16	00:02:13	00:02:15	Don't you ever die on me! Promise!
17	00:02:15	00:02:18	I won't. I promise.
18	00:02:21	00:02:23	It's the third jumper on campus this year.
19	00:02:23	00:02:26	Maybe it's contagious.
20	00:02:28	00:02:44	I saw this documentary once on suicides off the Golden Gate Bridge, and they interviewed a survivor and he said the moment that he let go of the railing, he realized that all of his problems were fixable, except for having jumped.
21	00:02:48	00:02:49	Hey, Catherine.
22	00:02:50	00:02:52	Uh, yeah, Nicky, what you got?
23	00:02:52	00:02:53	Chains and padlocks.
24	00:02:53	00:02:55	There's no roof access from the dorm.
25	00:02:55	00:03:01	Well, the body landed close to the building, so if she didn't come from the roof, she must have come out of a room.
26	00:03:01	00:03:03	Okay, I'll work my way down.
27	00:03:03	00:03:05	Nick, you in the dorm?
28	00:03:05	00:03:07	That's affirmative.
29	00:03:07	00:03:08	I'm with the resident director.
30	00:03:08	00:03:10	He's ID'd the victim as Kira Dellinger.
31	00:03:10	00:03:12	She's in Room 807.
32	00:03:12	00:03:14	She's a freshman from McLean, Virginia.
33	00:03:14	00:03:17	I guess I'm going to go notify the parents.
34	00:03:17	00:03:19	Perks of the job.
35	00:03:19	00:03:21	Yeah.
36	00:04:18	00:04:23	Hey, Catherine, do you see any wounds on the body inconsistent with the fall?
37	00:04:23	00:04:25	Hang on.
38	00:04:25	00:04:26	I did find this.
39	00:04:26	00:04:31	Yeah, there's a long perimortem abrasion on the lower back.
40	00:04:31	00:04:33	I think I know how it got there.
41	00:04:35	00:04:37	No!
42	00:04:38	00:04:40	Drag 'n' drop.
43	00:05:39	00:05:40	Oh, ooh!
44	00:05:40	00:05:41	Oh... Ooh, where's the fire?
45	00:05:42	00:05:45	Oh, sorry.
46	00:05:46	00:05:48	Ah.
47	00:05:48	00:05:49	Zopidem?
48	00:05:49	00:05:51	That's good stuff.
49	00:05:51	00:05:52	Yeah, it's to help me sleep.
50	00:05:52	00:05:54	I've been having the hardest time lately.
51	00:05:54	00:05:56	Me, too.
52	00:05:56	00:06:00	Well, just coming off of grave after all these years, you know, takes a while to adjust.
53	00:06:01	00:06:03	You're a tough cookie. I'm not worried about you.
54	00:06:03	00:06:05	Take care of yourself, huh?
55	00:06:05	00:06:06	Thanks. Yeah.
56	00:06:08	00:06:09	Sweet dreams.
57	00:06:09	00:06:10	Thanks.
58	00:06:14	00:06:16	Oh...
59	00:06:19	00:06:20	Hey.
60	00:06:20	00:06:22	Sara, you done with your scene?
61	00:06:22	00:06:25	Yeah. Great, because we just caught another one.
62	00:06:25	00:06:26	425 off Craig Road.
63	00:06:26	00:06:29	Busy shift, but you know I like that.
64	00:06:30	00:06:32	I'll see you outside, okay? Okay.
65	00:06:49	00:06:54	Neighbors called in a domestic disturbance between Adam and Kim Jimenez.
66	00:06:54	00:07:01	I responded, knocked and didn't get any answer, so I looked through the window, and this is what I saw.
67	00:07:01	00:07:02	Nobody's home, so I called you guys.
68	00:07:26	00:07:29	Blood but no body.
69	00:07:29	00:07:31	No.
70	00:07:31	00:07:33	Nothing.
71	00:07:35	00:07:37	Lots of blood activity here.
72	00:07:41	00:07:43	Then someone ran out the door.
73	00:07:47	00:07:48	Stop right there.
74	00:07:48	00:07:50	Hands where I can see 'em.
75	00:07:52	00:07:54	This is my house.
76	00:07:54	00:07:55	Mrs. Jimenez?
77	00:07:57	00:07:58	Where have you been?
78	00:07:59	00:08:03	My husband and I had an argument.
79	00:08:03	00:08:05	I went on a walk.
80	00:08:05	00:08:07	Where's your husband now?
81	00:08:09	00:08:12	I, uh...
82	00:08:12	00:08:13	I don't know.
83	00:08:18	00:08:20	Mr. Jimenez, are you okay?
84	00:08:20	00:08:21	Bad back.
85	00:08:23	00:08:27	Sara, she's got a very bad back.
86	00:08:30	00:08:31	This is CSI Lake.
87	00:08:31	00:08:33	We need paramedics right away on location.
88	00:08:48	00:08:49	Hey.
89	00:08:49	00:08:50	Hey.
90	00:08:50	00:08:53	What do you think this might be?
91	00:08:54	00:08:58	Well, possibly a tooth fragment.
92	00:08:58	00:08:59	High fall?
93	00:08:59	00:09:00	Yeah.
94	00:09:00	00:09:02	We think she was pushed.
95	00:09:02	00:09:06	So, between her knuckles-- suggests a struggle.
96	00:09:06	00:09:07	No!
97	00:09:08	00:09:10	Ah!
98	00:09:12	00:09:18	Was she raped? There's no trauma, but the wet mount indicates that she definitely had sex.
99	00:09:18	00:09:21	Oh, no condom. Good for us.
100	00:09:21	00:09:22	Yeah.
101	00:09:24	00:09:27	Such a scary thing, sending your kid off to college.
102	00:09:27	00:09:29	Is Lindsey looking already?
103	00:09:29	00:09:30	Yeah.
104	00:09:30	00:09:34	In fact, we looked at WLVU last month.
105	00:09:34	00:09:37	Well, at least she'd be close to home.
106	00:09:37	00:09:42	She's free on campus, might as well be a thousand miles away.
107	00:09:54	00:09:55	Hey.
108	00:09:55	00:09:57	Hey.
109	00:09:57	00:09:59	Any luck with dorm security? Nope.
110	00:09:59	00:10:05	There's no cameras, only key cards, but according to the residence director, the door's propped open all the time anyway.
111	00:10:05	00:10:07	Okay.
112	00:10:08	00:10:13	Kind of hard to tell the difference between a struggle and a typical college dorm room.
113	00:10:13	00:10:15	Yeah. You should have seen mine.
114	00:10:15	00:10:17	It was really bad.
115	00:10:29	00:10:31	Hmm. X marks the girl.
116	00:10:33	00:10:35	Symbol for a straight edge lifestyle.
117	00:10:35	00:10:39	Abstinence from drugs, tobacco, alcohol...
118	00:10:42	00:10:44	...but not sex.
119	00:10:44	00:10:45	Sexual lubricant.
120	00:10:46	00:10:47	Give me that.
121	00:10:49	00:10:51	So, pretty brave for college.
122	00:10:51	00:10:55	Yeah, or just another way to get attention.
123	00:10:59	00:11:03	Looks like our vic was in a Goth band.
124	00:11:03	00:11:05	You know, I used to be Goth.
125	00:11:05	00:11:07	Mm-hmm.
126	00:11:07	00:11:09	Yeah, the Goth thing was just an act.
127	00:11:09	00:11:10	Chicks dug it.
128	00:11:10	00:11:12	How does that work?
129	00:11:12	00:11:15	You act depressed to get chicks, you get depressed chicks.
130	00:11:28	00:11:30	Baby, are you okay?
131	00:11:30	00:11:32	Are you all right?
132	00:11:32	00:11:33	You doing okay, huh?
133	00:11:33	00:11:35	You all right? You okay? Yeah?
134	00:11:36	00:11:37	Did you call these cops on me?
135	00:11:38	00:11:39	No... Did you call the cops on me?!
136	00:11:39	00:11:42	(shouting) I didn't call the cops!
137	00:12:06	00:12:08	It's okay now. Sara?
138	00:12:08	00:12:10	Why don't you finish up here?
139	00:12:10	00:12:11	Wait a minute.
140	00:12:11	00:12:13	How are we going to handle this?
141	00:12:13	00:12:14	Well, the guy's under arrest.
142	00:12:14	00:12:16	He'll be free by tomorrow.
143	00:12:16	00:12:20	Her husband is obviously abusing her.
144	00:12:21	00:12:23	There's got to be something we can do.
145	00:12:23	00:12:26	We'll be back for her body next month.
146	00:12:26	00:12:27	Or his. Or both.
147	00:12:29	00:12:32	There is nothing you can do about this, Ronnie.
148	00:12:32	00:12:33	Don't kid yourself.
149	00:13:19	00:13:22	Sara, I've got something really good on that defenestrated college kid.
150	00:13:22	00:13:24	Oh, that's Catherine's case.
151	00:13:24	00:13:25	Or, you know what, talk to Nick.
152	00:13:25	00:13:27	No, no, no, you're really going to love this.
153	00:13:27	00:13:29	A print on a lube tube matched a print on her windowsill.
154	00:13:29	00:13:31	AFIS got a hit.
155	00:13:34	00:13:36	Ever think you'd see that guy again?
156	00:13:41	00:13:46	Marlon West was on trial for the murder of Stacy Vollmer.
157	00:13:46	00:13:47	He confessed.
158	00:13:47	00:13:50	It was later thrown out on a technicality.
159	00:13:50	00:13:51	We really didn't need it.
160	00:13:51	00:13:53	The prosecution's case against Marlon was very strong.
161	00:13:53	00:13:57	Until Marlon's little sister Hannah got on the stand and confessed to the murder herself.
162	00:13:57	00:14:00	Marlon didn't kill Stacy.
163	00:14:00	00:14:02	I did.
164	00:14:02	00:14:05	And I was wearing this when I did it.
165	00:14:05	00:14:08	Oh, yes, I remember this case.
166	00:14:08	00:14:10	A high school senior at age 12.
167	00:14:10	00:14:11	She's a prodigy.
168	00:14:11	00:14:13	She's a pint-size Machiavelli.
169	00:14:13	00:14:18	She manipulated events, fabricated evidence, and in the end...
170	00:14:18	00:14:22	We, the jury, find the defendant, Marlon West not guilty.
171	00:14:22	00:14:24	...snowed the jury.
172	00:14:24	00:14:26	And me.
173	00:14:26	00:14:28	Hannah, you are smart.
174	00:14:28	00:14:33	But you have to be really smart to make people think things happened that never did.
175	00:14:33	00:14:37	What do you mean exactly?
176	00:14:39	00:14:42	I didn't kill Stacy.
177	00:14:42	00:14:45	Marlon did.
178	00:14:45	00:14:48	She claimed that she did it because she loved Marlon.
179	00:14:48	00:14:50	Some warped sense of justice...
180	00:14:50	00:14:55	She graduated later that summer, became legally emancipated from her parents and went off to Harvard.
181	00:14:55	00:14:56	Pre-med.
182	00:14:56	00:14:58	You keeping tabs on her?
183	00:14:58	00:15:00	Not recently.
184	00:15:00	00:15:03	Look, accident or no accident, Marlon killed before.
185	00:15:03	00:15:06	Hannah sunk this case; Marlon got a free pass; and now he's killed again.
186	00:15:06	00:15:08	Well, we don't know that just yet.
187	00:15:08	00:15:12	I mean, we don't have Marlon's DNA to compare with the semen that was found in the victim.
188	00:15:13	00:15:14	All the old evidence was expunged with the verdict.
189	00:15:14	00:15:16	I want this case.
190	00:15:16	00:15:18	The one that got away?
191	00:15:18	00:15:20	We're not supposed to let them get away, right?
192	00:15:20	00:15:23	Okay.
193	00:15:23	00:15:25	I'll see if I can clear it with Ecklie.
194	00:15:26	00:15:27	Catherine has to supervise, though.
195	00:15:27	00:15:28	You report to her.
196	00:15:45	00:15:46	Hello, Marlon.
197	00:15:46	00:15:48	What are you guys doing here?
198	00:15:48	00:15:50	We here to talk to you about Kira Dellinger.
199	00:15:50	00:15:53	Kira committed suicide.
200	00:15:53	00:15:55	Actually, she was murdered.
201	00:15:57	00:16:00	Somebody I know ends up dead and I'm automatically a suspect?
202	00:16:00	00:16:02	History has a way of repeating itself, Marlon.
203	00:16:02	00:16:04	You've killed before, you know?
204	00:16:04	00:16:05	That was an accident.
205	00:16:05	00:16:08	And I admitted I was responsible from day one.
206	00:16:08	00:16:10	Kira was forced out her dorm window.
207	00:16:11	00:16:12	Your prints were there.
208	00:16:12	00:16:15	My prints were there because I've been in there a million times.
209	00:16:15	00:16:17	Kira and I were in a band.
210	00:16:17	00:16:22	Your prints were also found on a tube of sexual lubricant. Were you having sex with her, Marlon?
211	00:16:22	00:16:24	Yeah, we were having sex. Last night?
212	00:16:24	00:16:26	No, we had a gig last night.
213	00:16:27	00:16:29	We... We got into a fight.
214	00:16:29	00:16:31	Did she give you that fat lip?
215	00:16:34	00:16:35	No, not exactly.
216	00:16:38	00:16:40	Kira! Kira!
217	00:16:41	00:16:42	Keep your hands off her!
218	00:16:50	00:16:51	I'm done!
219	00:16:51	00:16:54	From now on, you stay away from me, psycho!
220	00:16:56	00:16:59	I don't know who the guy was. I had never seen him before.
221	00:16:59	00:17:01	After that, I just...
222	00:17:01	00:17:04	wandered the campus most of the night by myself.
223	00:17:04	00:17:05	So you don't have an alibi.
224	00:17:05	00:17:07	I guess I don't.
225	00:17:07	00:17:08	Well, I'll tell you what.
226	00:17:08	00:17:11	We will give you the benefit of the doubt in exchange for this.
227	00:17:11	00:17:13	You remember this.
228	00:17:16	00:17:18	I assume you have a DNA warrant, Sara.
229	00:17:18	00:17:22	Because if you don't, you certainly don't have his consent.
230	00:17:22	00:17:23	Isn't that right, Marlon?
231	00:17:24	00:17:28	Hannah, I heard you were studying back east-- what are you doing here?
232	00:17:28	00:17:30	Graduate school.
233	00:17:30	00:17:33	Excuse me. Excuse me.
234	00:17:36	00:17:38	You are not going to muddy the waters this time.
235	00:17:38	00:17:40	Are you sure you'd know if I had?
236	00:17:42	00:17:43	You're welcome to stay.
237	00:17:43	00:17:46	You might learn something.
238	00:17:56	00:18:00	Please turn to page 187, the Clausius- Clapeyron equation.
239	00:18:01	00:18:04	Oh, by the way, Professor Costin said it'll be on the exam.
240	00:18:09	00:18:10	I don't know, Sara.
241	00:18:10	00:18:11	It's going to be tough to get a warrant.
242	00:18:12	00:18:12	I need Marlon West's DNA.
243	00:18:13	00:18:15	If his semen is in Kira Dellinger, it puts him at the murder.
244	00:18:15	00:18:18	Look, they had a known sexual relationship, so there's no evidence of rape.
245	00:18:18	00:18:22	And I don't know if you know this, but Marlon's mother and father were killed in a car accident last year.
246	00:18:22	00:18:24	Judge Bowman is going to be very sensitive to that.
247	00:18:24	00:18:25	It could look like harassment.
248	00:18:25	00:18:28	Jim, are you going to talk to the judge or not?
249	00:18:28	00:18:30	Wow, you really got it out for this kid.
250	00:18:30	00:18:32	What's the deal here, Sara?
251	00:18:32	00:18:34	Marlon West has killed before.
252	00:18:34	00:18:35	Not according to a jury of his peers.
253	00:18:35	00:18:38	Did you have fun talking to Kira Dellinger's parents?
254	00:18:38	00:18:40	Excuse me?
255	00:18:40	00:18:42	Must've been a lot of screaming and crying and despair.
256	00:18:42	00:18:44	Yeah, there usually is. What's your point, Sara?
257	00:18:44	00:18:52	My point is, if we had done our job right the first time, Marlon West would be in jail, and Kira Dellinger would still be alive.
258	00:18:53	00:18:55	Talk to the judge.
259	00:18:57	00:19:01	HPLC found high levels of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in Kira Dellinger's blood.
260	00:19:01	00:19:03	GHB does occur naturally in the body.
261	00:19:03	00:19:05	You sure she was drugged?
262	00:19:05	00:19:06	Pretty sure.
263	00:19:06	00:19:08	Started to metabolize in her blood and urine when she died.
264	00:19:08	00:19:10	That typically indicates dosing.
265	00:19:10	00:19:13	Okay, so then maybe she was roofied, raped, then murdered.
266	00:19:13	00:19:16	And no vaginal trauma because she was too numb to resist.
267	00:19:16	00:19:17	It's possible.
268	00:19:17	00:19:19	You know, some people take GHB recreationally.
269	00:19:19	00:19:23	I didn't find any drug paraphernalia in her room.
270	00:19:23	00:19:25	It was pretty consistent with a straight edge lifestyle.
271	00:19:25	00:19:29	You know, that just sounds like something a girl tells her parents in order to make them feel better.
272	00:19:29	00:19:31	I mean, we know she had sex.
273	00:19:31	00:19:33	There was GHB in her system...
274	00:19:33	00:19:38	I think you just need to test everything in her room Okay.
275	00:19:38	00:19:41	So this is her Twitter page.
276	00:19:41	00:19:44	Got e-mails, IMs, text messages.
277	00:19:45	00:19:48	A minute-by-minute diary of Kira Dellinger's life.
278	00:19:48	00:19:50	With the last post a couple hours before she died.
279	00:19:50	00:19:53	What made you think to check her Twitter page?
280	00:19:53	00:20:01	Well, most date rape victims know their assailants, and Kira was an active blogger, so I figured if she was having trouble with anyone, she'd probably talk about it online.
281	00:20:01	00:20:03	Some people just don't value privacy.
282	00:20:04	00:20:05	They don't expect privacy.
283	00:20:05	00:20:07	They value openness.
284	00:20:07	00:20:10	Whatever.
285	00:20:10	00:20:12	(typing) Hmm.
286	00:20:12	00:20:16	It shouldn't suck when two boys fight over you, but it does.
287	00:20:16	00:20:18	Drummerboy19 won't be a man.
288	00:20:18	00:20:21	And TorchX wants what he can't have.
289	00:20:21	00:20:24	They both bug.
290	00:20:24	00:20:27	Looks like a virtual love triangle to me.
291	00:20:27	00:20:30	My guess is DrummerBoy19 is Marlon.
292	00:20:30	00:20:33	Well, TorchX responded to that.
293	00:20:35	00:20:38	KiraEdge, you know I never give up.
294	00:20:38	00:20:40	That could be a threat.
295	00:20:40	00:20:43	Let's see if this TorchX has a real name.
296	00:20:46	00:20:47	Jordan Rockwell.
297	00:20:47	00:20:51	I guess he values openness, too.
298	00:20:57	00:20:59	Mr. Rockwell, do you know this girl?
299	00:20:59	00:21:01	Yeah, sure.
300	00:21:01	00:21:03	It's Kira Dellinger.
301	00:21:03	00:21:06	When was the last time you saw her?
302	00:21:06	00:21:08	Uh... last night.
303	00:21:08	00:21:09	Hmm. Where?
304	00:21:09	00:21:11	At her place.
305	00:21:11	00:21:14	We had sex.
306	00:21:14	00:21:15	Nice. How did that happen?
307	00:21:15	00:21:17	We used to date in high school.
308	00:21:17	00:21:20	Then we reconnected online, and, uh...
309	00:21:20	00:21:24	I came down to the campus to check out her band.
310	00:21:24	00:21:26	So she gave you a roll for old times' sake.
311	00:21:26	00:21:31	Well, I, uh... I kind of helped her out with a boyfriend problem.
312	00:21:31	00:21:34	Is this the problem?
313	00:21:34	00:21:35	Yeah.
314	00:21:35	00:21:38	Yeah, that's the guy.
315	00:21:38	00:21:39	He was, uh...
316	00:21:39	00:21:42	he was into her, you know, but she...
317	00:21:42	00:21:43	she was not into him.
318	00:21:43	00:21:48	And he started giving her static, so... I knocked the little douche's teeth out.
319	00:21:48	00:21:54	I guess she kind of liked it, because she took me back to her place after that.
320	00:21:54	00:21:55	Then what?
321	00:21:55	00:21:59	I want to know everything up until the time when you wrapped your car around that telephone pole.
322	00:21:59	00:22:01	She fell asleep...
323	00:22:02	00:22:08	and then I started feeling sick, so I, uh, got my car to drive home.
324	00:22:08	00:22:14	Then I got really dizzy and, uh... wham.
325	00:22:16	00:22:17	That's it.
326	00:22:17	00:22:20	So she was alive the last time you saw her.
327	00:22:20	00:22:24	Wh-What do you mean, she was alive?
328	00:22:24	00:22:27	She's dead.
329	00:22:30	00:22:37	According to Brass, officers at the crash scene suspected that Jordan Rockwell was under the influence, so the hospital ran a tox panel.
330	00:22:37	00:22:38	Positive for GHB.
331	00:22:38	00:22:39	Really?
332	00:22:39	00:22:42	So this guy roofies himself along with Kira?
333	00:22:42	00:22:44	Did they share a drink?
334	00:22:44	00:22:47	Well, if they did, it wasn't in anything we tested.
335	00:22:47	00:22:52	Hodges ran all the water bottles and soda cans we collected from the room-- no GHB in anything.
336	00:22:52	00:22:53	Wait a minute.
337	00:22:53	00:22:56	I think I know what they shared.
338	00:22:58	00:23:01	Kira and Jordan had unprotected sex, right?
339	00:23:01	00:23:02	Yes.
340	00:23:04	00:23:06	That means...
341	00:23:06	00:23:09	they both came in contact...
342	00:23:09	00:23:11	with this.
343	00:23:11	00:23:13	Kudos to you.
344	00:23:13	00:23:15	The lube was indeed laced with GHB.
345	00:23:15	00:23:18	Not hard to do if you know a little chemistry.
346	00:23:18	00:23:20	Marlon takes chemistry.
347	00:23:20	00:23:22	Hannah teaches it.
348	00:23:22	00:23:24	We know Marlon's fingerprints are on the lube tube.
349	00:23:24	00:23:26	We know he was jealous.
350	00:23:26	00:23:29	Maybe the GHB-lube was his way of getting back at her.
351	00:23:29	00:23:32	You know? Give a drug-free girl a bad trip.
352	00:23:32	00:23:34	Which became a really bad trip.
353	00:23:35	00:23:36	Yeah.
354	00:23:36	00:23:40	But still, that doesn't conclusively put anybody at the crime scene.
355	00:23:40	00:23:42	There's one thing we have that does.
356	00:23:42	00:23:46	We can get a warrant for this.
357	00:23:47	00:23:50	I'm telling you, I didn't kill Kira.
358	00:23:50	00:23:53	I've never lied to you. Not once.
359	00:23:53	00:23:55	You just never believe me.
360	00:23:55	00:23:58	When I'm guilty, you want me to be innocent.
361	00:23:58	00:24:00	When I'm innocent, you want me to be guilty.
362	00:24:00	00:24:02	Hey, you know what, Marlon?
363	00:24:03	00:24:08	You can save it. 'Cause unlike most people, you're not going to get me to underestimate you.
364	00:24:08	00:24:16	I already know you're every bit as smart as your sister, especially when it comes to creating confusion.
365	00:24:16	00:24:18	Open up.
366	00:24:20	00:24:22	Bite down.
367	00:24:23	00:24:25	Let it sit.
368	00:24:33	00:24:36	He didn't kill Kira. He cared about her.
369	00:24:36	00:24:41	Hannah, what makes you think that I would believe anything that you tell me?
370	00:24:41	00:24:43	I suppose I'm an optimist.
371	00:24:45	00:24:51	College has been a difficult adjustment for Marlon, especially after we lost our parents.
372	00:24:51	00:24:53	I'm sorry about that.
373	00:24:53	00:24:55	You're not really, though.
374	00:24:57	00:24:59	When will Marlon be able to leave?
375	00:24:59	00:25:03	Well, we're going to keep him here as long as we possibly can.
376	00:25:04	00:25:06	At least that's honest.
377	00:25:06	00:25:11	It also seems a little vindictive.
378	00:25:11	00:25:13	Given your brother's history, I think it's pretty sensible.
379	00:25:15	00:25:17	What's wrong, Sara?
380	00:25:18	00:25:20	You're different than you used to be.
381	00:25:21	00:25:23	You're angry.
382	00:25:23	00:25:26	And a little sad, too.
383	00:25:26	00:25:27	Why?
384	00:25:27	00:25:34	If you want to spend more time with your brother, I recommend you invest in a good lawyer, Hannah.
385	00:25:52	00:25:54	It's a physical match.
386	00:25:54	00:25:56	Puts Marlon at the scene.
387	00:25:56	00:25:58	That's probably not enough to put him in jail.
388	00:25:58	00:26:00	I think I might be able to help you out there.
389	00:26:00	00:26:06	I found a Friend Agenda page for Kira and Marlon's band, The Death Crusade.
390	00:26:06	00:26:08	Seems like a lot of pictures for a college band.
391	00:26:08	00:26:12	Well, TDC, as they're called, has quite a solid fan base on campus.
392	00:26:12	00:26:15	Hannah was there.
393	00:26:15	00:26:17	Yeah. Marlon must've been thrilled.
394	00:26:17	00:26:22	What guy would like having his little sister around to watch as he gets his ass kicked in front of his girlfriend?
395	00:26:23	00:26:25	From now on, just stay away from me, psycho!
396	00:26:27	00:26:29	Marlon, Marlon, it's okay.
397	00:26:29	00:26:32	Kira, don't do this to me!
398	00:26:32	00:26:36	So this new guy pops Marlon in the mouth, chips his tooth.
399	00:26:36	00:26:38	Marlon's humiliated, decides to take it out on Kira.
400	00:26:38	00:26:47	Kills her, then tries to make it look like a suicide, and in the midst of their struggle, his tooth fragment ends up in her fist?
401	00:26:50	00:26:52	What are you looking for now?
402	00:26:52	00:26:54	I'm not sure.
403	00:27:48	00:27:50	What are you doing?
404	00:27:51	00:27:54	I'm just, uh, taking a closer look at Marlon's chipped tooth.
405	00:27:54	00:27:57	Look at the orientation of the fragment in the mouth.
406	00:28:01	00:28:04	And now look at the way the tooth ended up in Kira's right fist.
407	00:28:11	00:28:13	Looks like it's backwards.
408	00:28:13	00:28:14	I don't think Kira punched Marlon.
409	00:28:14	00:28:19	I think Hannah picked up the tooth from a fight that Marlon had earlier in the evening.
410	00:28:19	00:28:22	And I think she planted it on Kira.
411	00:28:22	00:28:24	That's crazy.
412	00:28:24	00:28:26	It's possible.
413	00:28:26	00:28:29	This kid is spinning me in circles again.
414	00:28:31	00:28:37	You know, Sara, some cases, some suspects can get under your skin.
415	00:28:37	00:28:40	Like this tooth.
416	00:28:40	00:28:43	But you can't let it make you feel bad.
417	00:28:43	00:28:45	If you want, we can put Nick on this.
418	00:28:45	00:28:48	No. No, I, um...
419	00:28:48	00:28:51	I need to finish this case.
420	00:28:51	00:28:53	I'll be okay.
421	00:28:55	00:28:57	Okay.
422	00:29:00	00:29:04	What is that in your hand?
423	00:29:05	00:29:06	I think it was a gum wrapper.
424	00:29:07	00:29:07	It's wrong to litter.
425	00:29:08	00:29:10	It's a piece of a tooth.
426	00:29:10	00:29:14	The one that Kira Dellinger's new boy-toy knocked out of Marlon's head.
427	00:29:20	00:29:24	You had already spiked Kira's lube with GHB.
428	00:29:24	00:29:26	All you had to do was wait.
429	00:29:28	00:29:32	A piece of his tooth in her fist.
430	00:29:35	00:29:37	A little bit of leverage.
431	00:29:37	00:29:40	And your brother's a killer again.
432	00:29:46	00:29:50	That's a highly unlikely series of events.
433	00:29:50	00:29:53	You don't expect me to confess to something I didn't do?
434	00:29:53	00:29:56	I am just putting you on notice. You are not fooling me anymore.
435	00:29:56	00:30:00	I think I know why you're so angry, Sara.
436	00:30:00	00:30:02	I did some research.
437	00:30:02	00:30:06	I read about what that serial killer did to you out in the desert, under that car...
438	00:30:06	00:30:08	We're talking about you, Hannah.
439	00:30:08	00:30:12	It must've been so terrible being trapped like that all alone.
440	00:30:12	00:30:14	Did your life flash in front of your eyes?
441	00:30:14	00:30:20	That is none of your business. You must've been so sad knowing that you were gonna lose everyone who mattered to you. Stop it, Hannah.
442	00:30:20	00:30:21	Look, I know how it feels.
443	00:30:21	00:30:26	One moment my parents were alive, and the next they were gone. Answer the question!
444	00:30:26	00:30:29	My life changed in that moment. All that I have left is Marlon.
445	00:30:29	00:30:31	Why would I do anything to hurt him?
446	00:30:33	00:30:36	Stop playing games with me.
447	00:30:40	00:30:42	You're the one who's playing games.
448	00:30:45	00:30:46	Hey.
449	00:30:46	00:30:47	What are you doing here?
450	00:30:47	00:30:49	I was going to ask you the same question.
451	00:30:49	00:30:50	Listen, I'm worried about you.
452	00:30:51	00:30:52	That just makes this worse.
453	00:30:52	00:30:56	I-I can't talk about this right now. I can't.
454	00:31:11	00:31:14	Just stay in touch, okay?
455	00:31:15	00:31:18	What happened? Her husband attack her again?
456	00:31:18	00:31:20	No. She came in voluntarily.
457	00:31:20	00:31:23	It took some convincing, but she's agreed to go to a shelter.
458	00:31:23	00:31:24	She won't stay.
459	00:31:24	00:31:25	Maybe not.
460	00:31:25	00:31:28	But at least now she has a chance.
461	00:31:28	00:31:30	Look, I did it all on my own time, no OT.
462	00:31:30	00:31:34	I know it's not the way you do things, but I think it's part of the job.
463	00:31:34	00:31:37	At least, that's how I want it to be. For me.
464	00:31:45	00:31:47	Why would Hannah want to frame me?
465	00:31:47	00:31:49	I don't know, Marlon.
466	00:31:49	00:31:51	She's your sister.
467	00:31:51	00:31:53	Hannah's always been kinda weird.
468	00:31:53	00:31:57	But since the trial... and after our parents died, she's started getting really weird.
469	00:31:58	00:31:59	Like how?
470	00:31:59	00:32:01	Really clingy, I guess.
471	00:32:01	00:32:03	Always wanting to hang around with me.
472	00:32:03	00:32:05	And that changed when you met Kira?
473	00:32:05	00:32:07	Yeah.
474	00:32:07	00:32:09	But not for Hannah.
475	00:32:15	00:32:17	Get out of here, you little freak!
476	00:32:17	00:32:20	Aren't you gonna get her out of here?!
477	00:32:20	00:32:23	Oh, I hope you two are really happy together. Freaks!
478	00:32:23	00:32:25	After that, Kira said she was done with me.
479	00:32:26	00:32:30	Marlon... don't be sad.
480	00:32:30	00:32:33	She doesn't deserve you.
481	00:32:33	00:32:36	You're right. She doesn't.
482	00:32:37	00:32:39	You want to help me teach Kira a lesson?
483	00:32:41	00:32:48	I asked Hannah to teach me how to make GHB, and how to get it into Kira.
484	00:32:48	00:32:50	I just wanted to mess her up a bit.
485	00:32:50	00:32:54	I snuck it into Kira's room a few days ago; I still had a key.
486	00:32:54	00:32:56	Hannah must've made a copy.
487	00:32:56	00:32:58	I believe you, Marlon.
488	00:32:58	00:33:00	I really do.
489	00:33:00	00:33:06	But the only thing that a jury's going to see is your prints on the lube, your prints on the windowsill, and another dead girl.
490	00:33:06	00:33:08	Why is Hannah doing this to me?
491	00:33:08	00:33:10	I don't know.
492	00:33:10	00:33:11	All I know is...
493	00:33:11	00:33:15	you don't deserve to take the fall for this.
494	00:33:15	00:33:18	And the question is...
495	00:33:18	00:33:25	are you going to let your sister get away with this and spend the rest of your life in jail?
496	00:33:25	00:33:28	If Hannah wants me in jail, that's where I'm going to be.
497	00:33:28	00:33:31	There's nothing I can do about it.
498	00:33:32	00:33:34	There is one thing.
499	00:33:43	00:33:45	One foot away from the bars at all times.
500	00:33:45	00:33:47	And no contact, you understand?
501	00:33:47	00:33:50	Yeah, I understand.
502	00:33:54	00:33:56	Thanks for coming.
503	00:33:56	00:33:59	The police said you needed me.
504	00:33:59	00:34:00	Yeah, I do.
505	00:34:00	00:34:05	I need to know... what I did to deserve this.
506	00:34:08	00:34:09	You killed Kira.
507	00:34:10	00:34:12	We both know I didn't do that.
508	00:34:16	00:34:19	You look a little flushed, Marlon.
509	00:34:19	00:34:22	Are you feeling all right?
510	00:34:22	00:34:24	No, I'm not feeling all right.
511	00:34:26	00:34:28	Kira always brought out the worst in you.
512	00:34:32	00:34:35	Hannah, they're going to put me away for the rest of my life.
513	00:34:35	00:34:40	The evidence is against you, particularly given your history of violence.
514	00:34:40	00:34:42	Please...
515	00:34:42	00:34:51	after everything I've done for you, after everything we've done for each other, at least tell me why.
516	00:34:54	00:34:56	Because I love you.
517	00:35:00	00:35:02	And I love you, too.
518	00:35:02	00:35:05	No.
519	00:35:05	00:35:08	You don't.
520	00:35:10	00:35:11	But you will.
521	00:35:14	00:35:18	I promise, I'll visit you every week.
522	00:35:22	00:35:23	We're done.
523	00:35:33	00:35:37	Well, he gave it a shot, but she is way out of his league.
524	00:35:37	00:35:41	She's out of mine, too.
525	00:35:53	00:35:54	Hi.
526	00:35:54	00:35:57	Hi.
527	00:36:01	00:36:03	Okay, what's up?
528	00:36:03	00:36:05	I'm sorry.
529	00:36:07	00:36:10	I've been, uh... (cell phone ringing)
530	00:36:14	00:36:16	This is Sara.
531	00:36:22	00:36:24	I'll be right there.
532	00:36:36	00:36:38	Guard found him about an hour ago.
533	00:36:38	00:36:39	Said he didn't even make a sound.
534	00:37:10	00:37:12	You need to talk to me again?
535	00:37:12	00:37:14	I do.
536	00:37:14	00:37:18	I know that you killed Kira Dellinger.
537	00:37:18	00:37:20	I just can't prove it.
538	00:37:20	00:37:23	That must be frustrating for you.
539	00:37:23	00:37:26	Hannah, Marlon's dead.
540	00:37:26	00:37:29	Wow.
541	00:37:29	00:37:35	That's a really sad and desperate ploy, Sara.
542	00:37:35	00:37:37	It's beneath you.
543	00:37:42	00:37:44	He was doing well here, wasn't he?
544	00:37:44	00:37:47	Making friends, joining a band, falling in love.
545	00:37:47	00:37:49	But you're still a freak, just like high school.
546	00:37:49	00:37:52	You're lying. No. This is a lie.
547	00:37:52	00:37:58	His world got bigger, and yours stayed the same, and you killed Kira so you could keep him all to yourself, didn't you?
548	00:37:58	00:38:00	It's a lie!
549	00:38:00	00:38:02	No... it's a lie!
550	00:38:02	00:38:03	It's a lie!
551	00:38:03	00:38:05	This is a... lie!
552	00:38:05	00:38:07	Stop it!
553	00:38:15	00:38:17	Marlon...
554	00:38:17	00:38:21	he-he-he can't leave me all alone.
555	00:41:03	00:41:05	Judy, have you seen Sara?
556	00:41:05	00:41:09	She left a few minutes ago, sir, but she did leave something for you.
557	00:41:11	00:41:12	Thank you.
558	00:41:19	00:41:21	Gil...
559	00:41:21	00:41:23	You know I love you.
560	00:41:23	00:41:26	I feel I've loved you forever.
561	00:41:26	00:41:28	Lately...
562	00:41:28	00:41:30	I haven't been feeling very well.
563	00:41:30	00:41:32	Truth be told, I'm tired.
564	00:41:32	00:41:40	Out in the desert, under that car that night, I realized something, and I haven't been able to shake it.
565	00:41:40	00:41:45	Since my father died, I've spent almost my entire life with ghosts.
566	00:41:45	00:41:53	We've been like close friends, and out there in the desert, it occurred to me that it was  time for me to bury them.
567	00:41:53	00:41:55	I can't do that here.
568	00:41:55	00:41:58	I'm so sorry.
569	00:41:58	00:42:05	No matter how hard I try to fight it off, I'm left with the feeling that... I have to go.
570	00:42:05	00:42:10	I have no idea where I'm going, but I know I have to do this.
571	00:42:11	00:42:18	If I don't, I'm afraid I'll self-destruct, and worse, you'll be there to see it happen.
572	00:42:18	00:42:21	Be safe.
573	00:42:21	00:42:25	Know that I tried very hard to stay.
574	00:42:25	00:42:28	Know that you are my one and only.
575	00:42:28	00:42:30	I will miss you with every beat of my heart.
576	00:42:30	00:42:35	Our life together was the only home I've ever really had.
577	00:42:35	00:42:38	I wouldn't trade it for anything.
578	00:42:38	00:42:40	I love you.
579	00:42:40	00:42:41	I always will.
580	00:42:41	00:42:45	Good-bye.
