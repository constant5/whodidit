0	00:00:01	00:00:05	Welcome to Jefferson High, home of the Pelicans.
1	00:00:05	00:00:07	Pelican pride.
2	00:00:07	00:00:11	Pelicans are, by the way, a shore bird-- Pelecanus occidentalis.
3	00:00:11	00:00:13	A water bird mascot in the desert?
4	00:00:13	00:00:16	Ooh, here comes Principal Meadows.
5	00:00:16	00:00:19	(laughs) Hi. Did you have a good weekend, Mason? Mm-hmm.
6	00:00:19	00:00:21	Um, what about that football game?
7	00:00:21	00:00:23	Ah, Turk was fantastic.
8	00:00:23	00:00:25	Oh, go... Pelicans!
9	00:00:25	00:00:26	Wait!
10	00:00:28	00:00:30	Turk can't name the vice president.
11	00:00:30	00:00:31	No joke.
12	00:00:31	00:00:33	And he's one failed test away from flunking out.
13	00:00:33	00:00:35	Ooh, but don't take my word for it.
14	00:00:35	00:00:37	Hey, Turk.
15	00:00:37	00:00:39	70 yards passing, not bad!
16	00:00:39	00:00:40	Oh, Chugga-Brew. I want to talk to you.
17	00:00:40	00:00:42	Uh, I'm busy, Turk.
18	00:00:42	00:00:44	Come on, man. This vertex of the para-boola is driving me nuts.
19	00:00:44	00:00:46	You're the only one who can explain it to me.
20	00:00:46	00:00:47	Maybe next time.
21	00:00:47	00:00:50	I almost feel sorry for him.
22	00:00:50	00:00:52	What up, boy?
23	00:00:52	00:00:57	Aw, is Mason making a little selfie video for his mommy?
24	00:00:57	00:00:58	Hi, Mason.
25	00:00:58	00:01:00	Come on, Hannah, give it back.
26	00:01:00	00:01:05	Wow, this thing is, like, five generations old.
27	00:01:05	00:01:08	Pretty lame for a tech geek.
28	00:01:08	00:01:09	What do you want?
29	00:01:09	00:01:12	World peace, Mason. World peace.
30	00:01:14	00:01:15	Great talk.
31	00:01:15	00:01:18	You know, I still can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.
32	00:01:19	00:01:22	Right here, Mason...
33	00:01:22	00:01:23	Hannah's my next-door neighbor.
34	00:01:23	00:01:27	We used to play kick the can and hang out, but then she got her braces off.
35	00:01:27	00:01:29	Hey, sweetie.
36	00:01:29	00:01:32	Remember to take the car in after school-- oil change.
37	00:01:32	00:01:33	I know.
38	00:01:33	00:01:35	You told me a billion times.
39	00:01:35	00:01:36	(sighs) That's my mom.
40	00:01:36	00:01:38	She teaches earth science here.
41	00:01:38	00:01:41	Ah, famous Pelican cheerleaders.
42	00:01:41	00:01:43	Good news, bad news.
43	00:01:43	00:01:45	Bad news-- it's eighth period.
44	00:01:45	00:01:48	Good news-- it's eighth period. (booming)
45	00:01:51	00:01:53	Holy crap, he's...
46	00:01:53	00:01:55	My God, someone call 911!
47	00:01:55	00:01:57	Grab a blanket, get some water! Call 911!
48	00:01:57	00:02:00	I got you, Chet, I got you.
49	00:02:00	00:02:01	Call an ambulance! Now!
50	00:02:07	00:02:09	Ed...
51	00:02:09	00:02:10	is he...?
52	00:02:14	00:02:16	Everybody, report to your homerooms.
53	00:02:16	00:02:18	Everybody, go back to class, come on.
54	00:02:36	00:02:37	Hey, Dave.
55	00:02:37	00:02:38	Hey.
56	00:02:38	00:02:40	Any I.D. on our burning man?
57	00:02:40	00:02:42	Chet Messner.
58	00:02:42	00:02:44	Taught chemistry.
59	00:02:44	00:02:48	Sadly appropriate, given his extreme thermal and chemical burns.
60	00:02:48	00:02:50	Fourth degree charring.
61	00:02:50	00:02:51	No one's gonna survive that.
62	00:02:51	00:02:52	Nope.
63	00:02:52	00:02:53	Any luck retracing his steps?
64	00:02:53	00:02:55	Yeah.
65	00:02:55	00:02:58	Uh, looks like the vic was in the classroom when something went wrong.
66	00:02:58	00:03:00	That's an understatement.
67	00:03:00	00:03:02	Clearly there was an explosion.
68	00:03:02	00:03:04	It appears he was doing some prep work for an experiment.
69	00:03:04	00:03:07	So, we're looking at an accident.
70	00:03:07	00:03:09	Maybe not, actually.
71	00:03:09	00:03:11	Look, I, um, I found his cell phone.
72	00:03:11	00:03:13	He received an anonymous text this morning.
73	00:03:13	00:03:15	Epic fail, Messner.
74	00:03:15	00:03:18	Do the right thing, or suffer the consequences.
75	00:03:18	00:03:19	So much for an accident.
76	00:03:19	00:03:22	Well, looks like Messner did the wrong thing.
77	00:03:24	00:03:25	And got burned.
78	00:04:01	00:04:03	I still can't believe it.
79	00:04:03	00:04:05	I mean, my goodness, Chet's always been so careful.
80	00:04:05	00:04:08	Makes an explosion in his lab all the more puzzling.
81	00:04:08	00:04:10	So, I understand it was eighth period.
82	00:04:10	00:04:12	Wasn't he teaching a class?
83	00:04:12	00:04:16	Uh, no. He normally grades papers then, or makes his lesson plans.
84	00:04:16	00:04:18	Did you know Mr. Messner well?
85	00:04:18	00:04:20	Oh, yeah.
86	00:04:20	00:04:22	About five years now.
87	00:04:22	00:04:24	He'd always throw great barbecues on the Fourth.
88	00:04:24	00:04:26	The whole faculty would go.
89	00:04:26	00:04:27	And what about his students?
90	00:04:27	00:04:28	Did he get along with them?
91	00:04:28	00:04:31	You don't think someone deliberately hurt Chet?
92	00:04:31	00:04:32	We don't know yet.
93	00:04:32	00:04:35	But I am going to need a list of all of his students' names.
94	00:04:35	00:04:36	The students loved Chet.
95	00:04:36	00:04:38	He put in a lot of time here.
96	00:04:38	00:04:45	In fact, right now he would be setting up for tomorrow's Pelican rally if... he hadn't...
97	00:04:46	00:04:48	Well, I'm sorry for your loss, Ms. Meadows.
98	00:04:48	00:04:50	Thanks for your time. Yeah.
99	00:04:52	00:04:55	How was your meeting with the principal?
100	00:04:55	00:04:58	According to her, everyone just loved good old Mr. Messner.
101	00:04:58	00:05:00	Until someone didn't.
102	00:05:00	00:05:01	We need our, uh, bunny suits?
103	00:05:01	00:05:03	I did a sweep.
104	00:05:03	00:05:06	Air samples are clear of hazardous chemicals.
105	00:05:06	00:05:08	So you get to be bunny-free.
106	00:05:08	00:05:10	Well, I guess that means we're late for class.
107	00:05:10	00:05:12	Aren't you gonna carry my kit?
108	00:05:14	00:05:15	No.
109	00:05:21	00:05:23	First responders said the sprinklers put out the fire.
110	00:05:23	00:05:26	The gas was still on, so they shut it off.
111	00:05:26	00:05:30	And it didn't look like the gas line had been tampered with at all.
112	00:05:30	00:05:32	But take a look at this.
113	00:05:32	00:05:33	Bunsen burner...
114	00:05:33	00:05:36	says that Mr. Messner was working on one of his lesson plans.
115	00:05:36	00:05:41	The burn marks that are radiating outwards say that this may be the point of origin.
116	00:05:41	00:05:43	Question is-- what set it off?
117	00:05:43	00:05:45	Fire needs an accelerant.
118	00:05:45	00:05:47	So, what are you thinking?
119	00:05:48	00:05:50	The scorching marks...
120	00:05:50	00:05:52	are going this way.
121	00:05:57	00:06:00	I think I might have found our accelerant.
122	00:06:04	00:06:09	Whatever was in here must have shot across the table like a rocket.
123	00:06:09	00:06:12	Yep, singed and blackened.
124	00:06:12	00:06:14	How am I doing so far?
125	00:06:15	00:06:17	Ms. Brody?
126	00:06:19	00:06:20	Hey, you're not paying attention.
127	00:06:20	00:06:23	It's 'cause I'm forming my own theory, professor.
128	00:06:23	00:06:25	It's here-- gummy bears.
129	00:06:25	00:06:28	On his crazy-tidy shelf.
130	00:06:28	00:06:31	You know the saying that, uh, sugar gives you energy?
131	00:06:31	00:06:32	Yeah.
132	00:06:32	00:06:34	I think that Messner was gonna try to prove that.
133	00:06:34	00:06:36	It's on his whiteboard there.
134	00:06:36	00:06:37	Tomorrow's lesson plan.
135	00:06:37	00:06:39	That's what he was prepping.
136	00:06:39	00:06:43	Molten potassium chlorate combined with glucose.
137	00:06:43	00:06:47	Potassium chlorate-- that's an accelerant, used in fireworks.
138	00:06:47	00:06:48	Makes for quite a show.
139	00:06:50	00:06:57	In fact, it's such a powerful oxidizer, that when you add the gummy bear or the sugar, it reacts violently.
140	00:06:57	00:06:59	Makes a loud noise, causes lots of flames.
141	00:06:59	00:07:01	It's kind of like a Roman candle.
142	00:07:02	00:07:05	Well, like a Roman candle, there should be no explosion.
143	00:07:05	00:07:07	It was supposed to be a controlled experiment.
144	00:07:07	00:07:10	Until you add the X factor to the equation.
145	00:07:10	00:07:11	The killer.
146	00:07:20	00:07:22	Epic fail, Messner.
147	00:07:22	00:07:25	Do the right thing, or suffer the consequences.
148	00:07:27	00:07:32	We traced this text to your phone, Mason.
149	00:07:32	00:07:34	I-I'm sorry.
150	00:07:34	00:07:36	I was just... venting.
151	00:07:36	00:07:37	I didn't really mean it, I swear.
152	00:07:37	00:07:40	You sent a threatening text, Mason.
153	00:07:40	00:07:43	In this day and age, these things are taken very seriously.
154	00:07:43	00:07:45	Look, Mom, it was stupid. I know.
155	00:07:46	00:07:49	Mr. Russell, this is really unlike him.
156	00:07:49	00:07:52	I'm not just speaking as a mom, I'm speaking as a faculty member.
157	00:07:52	00:07:54	Mason's on the honor roll.
158	00:07:54	00:07:55	He is a good kid.
159	00:07:55	00:07:58	You good at chemistry, too, Mason?
160	00:07:58	00:08:00	I sent a text, all right?
161	00:08:00	00:08:03	But I did not inferno Mr. Messner.
162	00:08:04	00:08:06	I-I was mad.
163	00:08:06	00:08:08	He gave me a B+ for the semester.
164	00:08:08	00:08:10	I missed a few days here and there.
165	00:08:11	00:08:13	I was sick.
166	00:08:13	00:08:15	And he wouldn't give me a break.
167	00:08:15	00:08:16	Why didn't you talk to him?
168	00:08:16	00:08:18	I did.
169	00:08:18	00:08:22	Like a lot of people around here, he held me to a higher standard.
170	00:08:22	00:08:25	Chet could be very stubborn.
171	00:08:25	00:08:27	And that does not justify what you did.
172	00:08:27	00:08:31	The consequences you said that Mr. Messner would suffer, what'd you mean by that?
173	00:08:31	00:08:35	I heard those lines from a movie, it was... it was just a bluff.
174	00:08:35	00:08:37	I just wanted my A.
175	00:08:37	00:08:40	Because people expect big things from me.
176	00:08:42	00:08:45	And I didn't want to let you down.
177	00:08:45	00:08:49	And I know... I know how much all this means to you.
178	00:08:49	00:08:51	And... Mason.
179	00:08:51	00:08:53	You could never let me down.
180	00:08:56	00:08:58	Mr. Russell, does my son need a lawyer?
181	00:08:58	00:09:00	No, not at the moment.
182	00:09:08	00:09:11	Doc, can you explain this text I got from Hodges?
183	00:09:11	00:09:19	Okay, Nobody knows what the nose knows until the nose knows it. See Doc.
184	00:09:19	00:09:24	Our friend, Hodges, has the gene that allows him to smell the bitter almond odor of cyanide.
185	00:09:24	00:09:25	It's a gift.
186	00:09:25	00:09:26	Mmm, he has so many gifts.
187	00:09:26	00:09:27	Oh, yeah.
188	00:09:27	00:09:30	Note this pink lividity.
189	00:09:30	00:09:34	Indicative of cyanide poisoning.
190	00:09:34	00:09:36	Mr. Messner would have been a goner, fire or no fire.
191	00:09:36	00:09:40	So, Messner was poisoned before the explosion.
192	00:09:40	00:09:44	Killer did not push him into the flames, but he did dose him with cyanide.
193	00:09:44	00:09:48	In sufficient quantity to cause him to seize at a most inopportune time.
194	00:09:57	00:09:59	Well, that changes everything.
195	00:09:59	00:10:02	Killer didn't have to be in the classroom.
196	00:10:03	00:10:04	Do you know how he was dosed?
197	00:10:04	00:10:07	Normally cyanide presents in the stomach lining and nasal passages.
198	00:10:07	00:10:09	But I found no signs of this.
199	00:10:09	00:10:11	So he didn't eat it, and he didn't snort it.
200	00:10:11	00:10:13	What else do you know about him?
201	00:10:13	00:10:18	Uh, he was single, been in Vegas for about five years, no record. Why?
202	00:10:18	00:10:20	Well, he was wearing this.
203	00:10:20	00:10:22	It's called a life rune.
204	00:10:22	00:10:24	It's a gang symbol.
205	00:10:24	00:10:27	Two weeks ago, I saw the same symbol.
206	00:10:27	00:10:29	It was tattooed on a dead biker's ass.
207	00:10:29	00:10:31	Blended nicely with his swastikas.
208	00:10:31	00:10:35	So, our lovable teacher, Chet Messner, may have had a dark secret.
209	00:10:46	00:10:48	This a bad time, Russ?
210	00:10:48	00:10:49	I got something for you.
211	00:10:49	00:10:50	Come on in.
212	00:10:51	00:10:52	I ran Messner's credit cards.
213	00:10:52	00:10:54	Now, one thing really popped out.
214	00:10:54	00:10:57	He's been ordering monthly shipments of red phosphorus powder.
215	00:10:57	00:10:59	Man's a chemistry teacher, though, right?
216	00:10:59	00:11:02	He got it from some shady supplier online.
217	00:11:02	00:11:04	And he got it delivered to his house.
218	00:11:04	00:11:07	Some little place out on Sloan Canyon. What are you thinking?
219	00:11:07	00:11:09	We both know what red phosphorus powder is used for.
220	00:11:09	00:11:12	Chemistry teacher dealing meth.
221	00:11:12	00:11:13	Good show.
222	00:11:13	00:11:17	I'm just saying, Messner may have some enemies we haven't considered.
223	00:11:17	00:11:19	Maybe he stepped on the wrong dealer's turf.
224	00:11:19	00:11:23	Yeah, and then that dealer goes back to that school, and gives Messner a big old fat F in meth class.
225	00:11:23	00:11:25	Go get 'em.
226	00:11:29	00:11:31	Main house is clear.
227	00:11:31	00:11:33	Really?
228	00:11:33	00:11:35	All right, we'll check the shed.
229	00:11:55	00:11:57	There's a knife.
230	00:11:57	00:12:00	With what looks like blood on it right there.
231	00:12:00	00:12:03	This doesn't look like a meth lab to me.
232	00:12:03	00:12:06	Man, these are some creepy-ass tapestries.
233	00:12:08	00:12:11	I think it might be more than just that.
234	00:12:12	00:12:15	I've seen this stuff before.
235	00:12:15	00:12:17	Double in the Alphabets.
236	00:12:17	00:12:20	This, uh, this whack-job...
237	00:12:20	00:12:23	he killed a couple as a sacrifice.
238	00:12:23	00:12:25	To the moon god.
239	00:12:25	00:12:27	So, what is this, devil worship?
240	00:12:27	00:12:29	No, not exactly.
241	00:12:29	00:12:30	Stokes.
242	00:12:32	00:12:34	Book of Shadows. What's that?
243	00:12:34	00:12:35	It's like a book of spells.
244	00:12:35	00:12:37	This is a ceremonial altar and a cauldron.
245	00:12:37	00:12:40	The only thing that's missing is a broom.
246	00:12:41	00:12:43	Our chemistry teacher's a witch.
247	00:12:48	00:12:57	Air, fire, water, earth, elements of astral birth, I call on thee, and offer these gifts.
248	00:12:58	00:13:00	I call you now...
249	00:13:00	00:13:01	Attend to me.
250	00:13:01	00:13:02	This is my will.
251	00:13:02	00:13:05	So mote it be.
252	00:13:07	00:13:08	What happens next?
253	00:13:08	00:13:09	No, wait.
254	00:13:09	00:13:10	Don't tell me.
255	00:13:10	00:13:12	Let me guess.
256	00:13:12	00:13:13	Lightning strikes, right?
257	00:13:13	00:13:16	No, coven meeting starts.
258	00:13:16	00:13:18	Sounds like you've been to one.
259	00:13:18	00:13:22	Actually, my parents befriended a Wiccan couple back in the '60s.
260	00:13:22	00:13:24	So I know a little bit about it.
261	00:13:24	00:13:25	It's a pagan religion.
262	00:13:25	00:13:30	They use spells to harness the earth's energy to grant positive wishes.
263	00:13:32	00:13:35	That's the sign of the devil right there.
264	00:13:35	00:13:36	The five-pointed star?
265	00:13:36	00:13:40	No, that's a sign of balance and strength, actually.
266	00:13:40	00:13:42	It's a protective symbol.
267	00:13:42	00:13:44	I always thought it was a sign of the devil.
268	00:13:44	00:13:45	Well, you're wrong.
269	00:13:51	00:13:52	Yeah.
270	00:13:52	00:13:54	This is our red phosphorus right here.
271	00:13:54	00:13:58	I think Messner was making magic, not meth, in here.
272	00:13:58	00:14:01	Yes, the question is-- did magic lead to murder?
273	00:14:01	00:14:03	Well, they were in here mixing up potions.
274	00:14:03	00:14:04	Maybe one of them...
275	00:14:04	00:14:06	made a cyanide spell.
276	00:14:07	00:14:08	There's a singed hair in here.
277	00:14:08	00:14:11	Looks human.
278	00:14:11	00:14:13	A burnt human hair in a cauldron?
279	00:14:13	00:14:17	How does that work in the hocus-pocus business?
280	00:14:17	00:14:20	Well, that's a little disturbing, actually.
281	00:14:20	00:14:24	Why don't we turn this place upside down, see if they left more than a human hair behind.
282	00:14:48	00:14:50	And he's wearing a robe.
283	00:14:52	00:14:53	Helps me get into it.
284	00:14:53	00:14:55	Come on, this is Vegas.
285	00:14:55	00:14:56	Anything goes.
286	00:14:56	00:14:57	Where can't you find a relic Druid robe?
287	00:14:57	00:15:00	Well, did the robe help? It did.
288	00:15:00	00:15:04	I think I know what our witches were cooking in the Wiccan kitchen.
289	00:15:04	00:15:06	And if you'll step into my Wiccan kitchen, I'll be happy to explain.
290	00:15:09	00:15:12	Using a two-quart cast-iron cauldron...
291	00:15:12	00:15:20	you add human blood, a teaspoon of red phosphorus, then garnish with human hair. You heat it all up until there is a gloomy smoke, and then you have...
292	00:15:20	00:15:24	A group of sad lost people inhaling toxic fumes?
293	00:15:24	00:15:26	No.
294	00:15:26	00:15:28	A banishment spell.
295	00:15:28	00:15:31	Charge this by your powers.
296	00:15:31	00:15:33	Break this circle.
297	00:15:33	00:15:35	Banish the leper.
298	00:15:35	00:15:36	Let us be reborn.
299	00:15:36	00:15:38	Since when are you a Wicca expert?
300	00:15:38	00:15:40	Dated one in college.
301	00:15:40	00:15:41	Uh, she was intense.
302	00:15:41	00:15:42	Perhaps too natural?
303	00:15:42	00:15:47	Truth be told, uh, she didn't have a bathing spell in her Book of Shadows.
304	00:15:47	00:15:50	Okay, okay, let's just get back to this... spell.
305	00:15:50	00:15:53	Are you saying that Messner was being banished?
306	00:15:53	00:15:55	Thou art correct.
307	00:15:55	00:15:58	I found one drop of unburned blood on the lip of the cauldron.
308	00:15:58	00:16:00	Now, per the spell, it means that Messner was the target.
309	00:16:01	00:16:03	Suggests motive.
310	00:16:03	00:16:07	Maybe Messner wasn't willing to go quietly into that witchy night.
311	00:16:07	00:16:10	So, another witch concocts a deadly brew to silence him.
312	00:16:11	00:16:14	Toil and trouble, let the cyanide bubble.
313	00:16:14	00:16:17	Any luck with the hair in the cauldron?
314	00:16:17	00:16:19	Henry found DNA on the follicle.
315	00:16:19	00:16:21	Unknown female, no hits in CODIS.
316	00:16:21	00:16:25	But the prints on the candle... shed more light.
317	00:16:27	00:16:30	In fact, I.D.'s four of our witches.
318	00:16:30	00:16:33	Turns out that Wiccans come from all walks of life.
319	00:16:33	00:16:37	Our first witch is a postal worker, currently on vacation in Florida.
320	00:16:37	00:16:39	Okay, postal worker's out.
321	00:16:39	00:16:43	Witch number two is a pharmaceutical saleswoman with a DUI on her record.
322	00:16:43	00:16:45	She's on the road this week.
323	00:16:45	00:16:46	Alibis her.
324	00:16:46	00:16:49	But school was in session for two of our other witches.
325	00:16:49	00:16:52	Requiring that their fingerprints, too, were in the system.
326	00:16:54	00:16:56	Witch number three is our own Ms. Brewer.
327	00:16:56	00:16:58	Earth science teacher, spell caster.
328	00:16:58	00:17:00	Ms. Brewer?
329	00:17:00	00:17:02	Didn't see that coming.
330	00:17:02	00:17:04	How about the man who tried to save Chet Messner?
331	00:17:05	00:17:06	I call on thee...
332	00:17:06	00:17:08	The janitor's a witch?
333	00:17:08	00:17:14	Why didn't you tell us that you and Chet Messner were part of a secret society?
334	00:17:14	00:17:16	There you go.
335	00:17:16	00:17:17	It's a secret.
336	00:17:17	00:17:21	Yeah, but secret-time kind of goes away when it's a homicide.
337	00:17:21	00:17:24	Our religion had nothing to do with what happened to Chet.
338	00:17:24	00:17:25	Maybe it did.
339	00:17:25	00:17:31	Could be a nervous witch, you know, makes a cyanide potion to stop a fellow witch from outing your gang.
340	00:17:31	00:17:33	Isn't that what you guys are really about?
341	00:17:33	00:17:34	Curses and revenge?
342	00:17:34	00:17:37	You have a wrong idea about us.
343	00:17:37	00:17:39	Okay. Well, give me the right one.
344	00:17:39	00:17:41	Wicca saved me, Detective.
345	00:17:41	00:17:43	Saved you?
346	00:17:43	00:17:46	I came to Vegas to hustle cards.
347	00:17:46	00:17:47	It ate me up.
348	00:17:48	00:17:51	Left me a broke alcoholic.
349	00:17:51	00:17:54	I found serenity in the power of nature.
350	00:17:54	00:17:58	Fact is, peace is at the core of our belief.
351	00:17:58	00:17:59	That's what we're about.
352	00:17:59	00:18:03	If someone hurt Chet, it came from the outside.
353	00:18:03	00:18:05	The whole thing was a shock to me.
354	00:18:05	00:18:06	It was my second gathering.
355	00:18:06	00:18:08	Oh, so you're new to the craft.
356	00:18:08	00:18:10	Yes, Chet asked me to join.
357	00:18:10	00:18:12	And then he's banished.
358	00:18:12	00:18:15	I didn't think that it was fair, but I was new.
359	00:18:15	00:18:16	And who was I to question the coven?
360	00:18:16	00:18:18	They all wanted him gone.
361	00:18:18	00:18:21	Chet had been speaking publically about coven activities.
362	00:18:21	00:18:24	Shoot his mouth off to complete strangers.
363	00:18:24	00:18:28	He thought it was a way of getting out the message.
364	00:18:28	00:18:30	How'd that make you feel?
365	00:18:30	00:18:31	Not good.
366	00:18:33	00:18:35	But not bad enough to kill.
367	00:18:36	00:18:40	Talking out of school is why Chet was banished; it's not why he was murdered.
368	00:18:42	00:18:44	A Wiccan doesn't kill.
369	00:18:45	00:18:49	We have one unidentified female member of the coven, but I need some names.
370	00:18:49	00:18:51	I'm not allowed to divulge names.
371	00:18:51	00:18:52	I'm sorry.
372	00:18:52	00:18:54	Oh.
373	00:18:54	00:18:55	Well, I'm sorry, too.
374	00:18:55	00:19:03	Because talking to members of the coven, people who knew Chet well-- that's our best shot at figuring out who hurt your friend.
375	00:19:04	00:19:07	I have been lost...
376	00:19:07	00:19:09	since my husband passed.
377	00:19:09	00:19:15	And this might sound corny, but there is a holiness to the cosmos.
378	00:19:15	00:19:17	A harmony.
379	00:19:17	00:19:20	It helps me get through the bad days.
380	00:19:20	00:19:23	I owe it to them to protect their privacy.
381	00:19:25	00:19:27	I can't break a sacred oath.
382	00:19:27	00:19:28	What did you think?
383	00:19:28	00:19:31	You're asking me-- do I think they're protecting themselves or someone else?
384	00:19:31	00:19:33	Yeah.
385	00:19:33	00:19:35	(sighs) I'm not sure.
386	00:19:35	00:19:37	Well, they could be telling the truth, right?
387	00:19:37	00:19:40	I mean, I like to think that society's a little more tolerant nowadays.
388	00:19:40	00:19:46	Do we really think that a member of a coven would be willing to kill another member for fear of being exposed?
389	00:19:46	00:19:49	I don't know, a banishment spell for loose lips?
390	00:19:49	00:19:53	I mean, that tells me the first rule of witch club is, Don't talk about witch club.
391	00:19:54	00:19:55	Greg.
392	00:19:55	00:19:58	Hop off the broom, join me back on Planet Earth.
393	00:19:59	00:20:00	He's very funny today.
394	00:20:00	00:20:01	Hilarious.
395	00:20:03	00:20:05	Hey, what do you got?
396	00:20:05	00:20:10	Well, I think Messner was making more than just Roman candles in his classroom.
397	00:20:10	00:20:12	He was also making a synthetic brew.
398	00:20:12	00:20:16	I took a Dumpster dive behind the school-- you're welcome-- and I, uh, found this vial.
399	00:20:16	00:20:20	Now, it's got to be from Messner's lab because his prints are all over it.
400	00:20:20	00:20:24	Also found traces of androstenedione and clostebol in it.
401	00:20:24	00:20:26	So he was making drugs.
402	00:20:26	00:20:27	Just not meth.
403	00:20:27	00:20:28	Nope, steroids.
404	00:20:28	00:20:32	I also found this dosing schedule.
405	00:20:32	00:20:34	His own book of steroids.
406	00:20:34	00:20:38	He was supplying PEDs to a lot of Jefferson student-athletes.
407	00:20:38	00:20:40	He even used code names.
408	00:20:40	00:20:42	Note the, uh, most popular client.
409	00:20:42	00:20:43	QB?
410	00:20:43	00:20:45	Not very subtle.
411	00:20:45	00:20:47	No, apparently code names weren't his strong suit.
412	00:20:47	00:20:49	Quarterback is Rob Turkla.
413	00:20:49	00:20:55	Now this is Mason Brewer's selfie video of Messner's last seconds.
414	00:21:01	00:21:04	Now, check out the QB's locker.
415	00:21:06	00:21:08	What is that, a traveling medical kit?
416	00:21:08	00:21:11	Complete with syringes for your exotic destinations.
417	00:21:11	00:21:15	Yeah, I'm thinking that Turk doesn't travel much beyond the football field.
418	00:21:16	00:21:18	I, uh, pulled Messner's phone records.
419	00:21:18	00:21:20	Was he talking with Turk?
420	00:21:20	00:21:22	Every Friday.
421	00:21:22	00:21:27	So, we have a teacher and a student involved in a highly illicit scheme.
422	00:21:27	00:21:29	Could have been bad for either one of them if it had come out.
423	00:21:29	00:21:32	But Messner had other student clients, so why Turk?
424	00:21:32	00:21:34	Well, first off, Messner was broke.
425	00:21:34	00:21:37	He had big credit card problems, five cards he couldn't pay.
426	00:21:37	00:21:41	Teacher's salary-- selling drugs solves the problem, right.
427	00:21:41	00:21:47	Well, two days ago, Messner sent Turk an e-mail, threatening to expose him.
428	00:21:47	00:21:51	No cash, no college career for you if this comes out.
429	00:21:51	00:21:53	Be smart for once.
430	00:21:53	00:21:58	I think QB was stiffing Messner, and Messner wasn't having it.
431	00:21:58	00:21:59	So he called an audible.
432	00:21:59	00:22:01	Okay.
433	00:22:01	00:22:03	Nice work. I'll have Crawford pick Turk up.
434	00:22:13	00:22:15	Got your text.
435	00:22:15	00:22:17	I got your suspect.
436	00:22:17	00:22:19	I don't think he's gonna be talking much.
437	00:22:27	00:22:28	Hey, Dave...
438	00:22:28	00:22:30	how's his head look?
439	00:22:30	00:22:33	Well, I'm seeing blunt force trauma to the back of the skull.
440	00:22:33	00:22:36	I'd say about 15 pounds' worth.
441	00:22:36	00:22:37	Yeah.
442	00:22:37	00:22:38	That would do it.
443	00:22:40	00:22:41	Well, the weight room's just over there.
444	00:22:41	00:22:48	I'm thinking that the killer grabbed the murder weapon from there, followed Turk from the weight room, then clocked him here by the pool.
445	00:22:48	00:22:50	I think he was alive when he went in the pool.
446	00:22:50	00:22:53	There's a thin band of foam at his mouth.
447	00:22:53	00:22:54	Suggests drowning.
448	00:22:54	00:22:55	One-two punch.
449	00:22:55	00:22:59	Blunt force trauma knocked him down...
450	00:23:01	00:23:03	...pool finished him off.
451	00:23:03	00:23:06	00 a.m.
452	00:23:06	00:23:09	Are there any security cameras around here? No.
453	00:23:09	00:23:13	00, so nobody saw anything.
454	00:23:13	00:23:15	We have a suspect turned vic.
455	00:23:15	00:23:17	So what do you think?
456	00:23:17	00:23:20	Two murders, two days, one high school...
457	00:23:20	00:23:23	Maybe the QB knew something about the Messner murder.
458	00:23:23	00:23:25	And drowned men tell no tales.
459	00:23:27	00:23:32	This is one sheet of 92 that were exposed to the fire in Mr. Messner's classroom.
460	00:23:32	00:23:36	I processed every single one.
461	00:23:36	00:23:38	Okay. Why is this one special?
462	00:23:38	00:23:39	It's the murder weapon.
463	00:23:41	00:23:46	This is getting fun. The one thing we still haven't been able to deduce is how the cyanide got into Mr. Messner's body.
464	00:23:46	00:23:48	But I have an idea.
465	00:23:48	00:23:50	Contact... with the paper.
466	00:23:50	00:23:56	This paper is coated with a combination of cyanide and dimethyl sulfoxide.
467	00:23:56	00:23:57	DMSO.
468	00:23:57	00:23:59	A solvent.
469	00:23:59	00:24:01	One that can carry substances into the skin.
470	00:24:01	00:24:02	In this case, cyanide.
471	00:24:02	00:24:04	A massive dose.
472	00:24:04	00:24:06	Kind of like a chemical hypodermic needle.
473	00:24:06	00:24:09	I don't think Messner was the intended target.
474	00:24:09	00:24:11	This isn't just any piece of paper.
475	00:24:11	00:24:18	This is the answer key to Mr. Messner's Chem IV final, which was left in a drawer for his worst student, Rob Turkla.
476	00:24:18	00:24:19	Wait a minute.
477	00:24:19	00:24:20	How do you know that part?
478	00:24:20	00:24:26	I found a very suspicious VidTree image buried in Turk's deleted phone data.
479	00:24:26	00:24:30	Touchdown. Your A+ is in Messner's top drawer.
480	00:24:30	00:24:31	Sent the day he died.
481	00:24:31	00:24:33	Do we know by whom?
482	00:24:33	00:24:37	VidTree snapshots disappear after a couple seconds.
483	00:24:37	00:24:40	Kids use them, 'cause they think that they can send something without their parents ever finding out.
484	00:24:40	00:24:46	But in reality, all the data is still saved up in the cloud, where we can eventually find it.
485	00:24:46	00:24:49	I'm... doing a search on the sender as we speak.
486	00:24:49	00:24:54	So, if you're right, then this answer key was left in Messner's classroom for Turk to find.
487	00:24:54	00:24:56	And Messner found it first.
488	00:24:56	00:24:58	Messner was a neat freak.
489	00:24:58	00:25:00	If anything was out of place, he would've noticed.
490	00:25:00	00:25:05	With DMSO acting as a skin absorbent for the cyanide...
491	00:25:05	00:25:09	anybody who touched that answer key was doomed.
492	00:25:13	00:25:15	Always better to study, kids.
493	00:25:15	00:25:16	Oop.
494	00:25:16	00:25:18	Got a hit on the sender.
495	00:25:20	00:25:21	Oh, my gosh.
496	00:25:23	00:25:24	Nice résumé, Hannah.
497	00:25:24	00:25:26	National Honor Roll.
498	00:25:26	00:25:27	President of the French Club.
499	00:25:27	00:25:29	Literacy Volunteer of the Year.
500	00:25:29	00:25:31	Captain of the swim team.
501	00:25:31	00:25:32	Is that right?
502	00:25:32	00:25:34	That's right.
503	00:25:34	00:25:35	Your specialty is the butterfly?
504	00:25:35	00:25:37	Yeah, how'd you know?
505	00:25:37	00:25:39	This here is, um...
506	00:25:39	00:25:42	Mr. Messner's steroid dosing schedule.
507	00:25:42	00:25:43	See the code there?
508	00:25:44	00:25:45	B-fly?
509	00:25:47	00:25:50	Look, I swear, I only took the drugs once.
510	00:25:50	00:25:52	You'd do anything to win, right?
511	00:25:52	00:25:55	On the field, in the classroom...
512	00:25:55	00:25:57	I looked at your e-mail.
513	00:25:57	00:26:03	Looked like you and Turk and a few other kids were planning on stealing Mr. Messner's Chem IV final.
514	00:26:03	00:26:04	That-that was all talk.
515	00:26:04	00:26:05	Not for Turk.
516	00:26:05	00:26:06	And not for you.
517	00:26:06	00:26:08	In fact, you...
518	00:26:08	00:26:09	used it as a murder weapon.
519	00:26:09	00:26:11	What are you saying?
520	00:26:11	00:26:17	The message you sent to lure Turk to Mr. Messner's classroom, where you left an answer sheet laced with cyanide.
521	00:26:17	00:26:19	Bad luck for you, Messner touched it first.
522	00:26:19	00:26:22	So you scheduled a make-up with Turk.
523	00:26:22	00:26:24	At the pool.
524	00:26:24	00:26:26	I didn't kill Turk.
525	00:26:26	00:26:27	And I didn't kill Mr. Messner.
526	00:26:27	00:26:29	Look, I didn't... I didn't send this.
527	00:26:29	00:26:30	It's from your account.
528	00:26:30	00:26:32	Someone must've hacked me.
529	00:26:32	00:26:35	I mean, it's-it's not like it hasn't happened before.
530	00:26:35	00:26:36	Why would somebody do that to you?
531	00:26:40	00:26:43	Hannah, you have to talk to me.
532	00:26:47	00:26:50	You want to know why...
533	00:26:50	00:26:53	someone would hack my account, and kill Turk at the pool?
534	00:26:53	00:26:55	Because...
535	00:26:55	00:26:57	I am your best suspect.
536	00:27:00	00:27:02	I wanted him dead.
537	00:27:02	00:27:03	Why?
538	00:27:03	00:27:05	Because of what he...
539	00:27:06	00:27:08	Because of what he did to me.
540	00:27:10	00:27:12	He...
541	00:27:15	00:27:17	...a-attacked me.
542	00:27:23	00:27:24	Why didn't you report it?
543	00:27:24	00:27:25	To who?
544	00:27:25	00:27:27	The cops?
545	00:27:27	00:27:31	What, because they're gonna believe my word over Mr. Friday Night Football?
546	00:27:35	00:27:38	Turk was the best class I ever took.
547	00:27:38	00:27:41	Taught me what the world's really like.
548	00:27:41	00:27:44	You wouldn't understand.
549	00:27:44	00:27:49	Just so you know, I leave early on Thursday nights from practice.
550	00:27:49	00:27:52	Coach thinks I'm at tutoring.
551	00:27:54	00:27:56	But really I'm at a women's shelter...
552	00:27:58	00:28:00	...for counseling.
553	00:28:02	00:28:03	I'll look into that.
554	00:28:03	00:28:04	Go ahead.
555	00:28:04	00:28:06	They'll tell you I was there.
556	00:28:14	00:28:18	QB's lungs are overinflated, heavy with fluid.
557	00:28:18	00:28:20	Confirms drowning was C.O.D.
558	00:28:22	00:28:27	Jaundice and liver damage are consistent with chronic anabolic steroid use.
559	00:28:27	00:28:29	All to score a bunch of touchdowns.
560	00:28:29	00:28:33	Well, as expected, I found syringe marks on this QB's posterior.
561	00:28:33	00:28:36	Usual target for injecting PEDs.
562	00:28:36	00:28:39	Right. But I can't explain this target.
563	00:28:39	00:28:41	Another injection site. Why is that different?
564	00:28:41	00:28:43	Well, it's not his usual injection site.
565	00:28:43	00:28:46	Needle hit the median cubital vein.
566	00:28:46	00:28:49	Take a look here.
567	00:28:49	00:28:54	What's even more unusual is this two-inch section of vein leading away from the puncture site.
568	00:28:54	00:28:55	It's devoid of blood.
569	00:28:55	00:28:58	The killer withdrew blood from Turk after he died.
570	00:28:58	00:29:03	There was no blood pumping, otherwise the vein would have refilled.
571	00:29:05	00:29:06	That's crazy.
572	00:29:06	00:29:08	The median cubital vein tells no lies.
573	00:29:08	00:29:11	Can it tell us why somebody took the blood of a dead man?
574	00:29:11	00:29:13	Afraid not.
575	00:29:17	00:29:19	Hey.
576	00:29:19	00:29:23	So I, uh, I made some calls, and...
577	00:29:23	00:29:25	your story checks out.
578	00:29:25	00:29:26	About the counseling.
579	00:29:26	00:29:29	I'm so sorry for what Turk did to you.
580	00:29:29	00:29:31	You have every right to be angry.
581	00:29:31	00:29:34	I'm not angry.
582	00:29:34	00:29:35	Anymore.
583	00:29:36	00:29:38	My eyes are just open now.
584	00:29:38	00:29:40	For what it's worth...
585	00:29:40	00:29:46	there are far more good people out there than there are... Rob Turklas.
586	00:29:47	00:29:50	Don't close your eyes to that.
587	00:29:52	00:29:55	Did you hear about Turk's body?
588	00:29:55	00:29:55	Yeah.
589	00:29:55	00:29:57	I know these folks are your people, okay... (laughs)
590	00:29:57	00:30:01	...but this hocus-pocus stuff isn't sitting well with me.
591	00:30:01	00:30:02	Well, what are you thinking?
592	00:30:02	00:30:04	Well, it's not what I'm thinking, it's what I know.
593	00:30:04	00:30:06	I processed Turk's car in the garage.
594	00:30:06	00:30:08	Found a used condom in the backseat.
595	00:30:08	00:30:12	The DNA from the vaginal fluid was a match to the hair in the cauldron in Messner's shed.
596	00:30:12	00:30:14	Well, that-that's... that's great.
597	00:30:14	00:30:15	That's our unknown female.
598	00:30:15	00:30:18	I think so.
599	00:30:18	00:30:21	So our quarterback was boffing somebody in the coven.
600	00:30:21	00:30:24	Our mystery witch didn't just leave behind her DNA.
601	00:30:24	00:30:28	She, uh, also left her prints all over Turk's window.
602	00:30:28	00:30:30	Well, that begs the question...
603	00:30:30	00:30:31	which witch?
604	00:30:33	00:30:34	This is just dandy.
605	00:30:34	00:30:36	You actually think I hurt Turk?
606	00:30:36	00:30:37	Nonsense.
607	00:30:37	00:30:39	Really? Yeah.
608	00:30:39	00:30:44	You were sleeping with a student who's now dead.
609	00:30:44	00:30:45	Murdered in your school.
610	00:30:45	00:30:47	I was not sleeping with Turk.
611	00:30:47	00:30:55	My gosh. We have your fingerprints on the inside of his car windows and your DNA on his condom from the backseat.
612	00:30:55	00:30:57	Do-do I need to go on?
613	00:30:57	00:30:59	Turk was 18.
614	00:30:59	00:31:01	He was perfectly legal.
615	00:31:02	00:31:04	What we had was real.
616	00:31:04	00:31:05	Did your husband find it real?
617	00:31:05	00:31:07	Your marriage, your job...
618	00:31:07	00:31:08	you had a lot to lose.
619	00:31:08	00:31:10	Mr. Russell...
620	00:31:10	00:31:12	every day, I play pretend. Mm-hmm.
621	00:31:12	00:31:16	I pretend that Pelican sports matter.
622	00:31:16	00:31:19	I pretend not to resent the fact that I'm a failed interior decorator.
623	00:31:19	00:31:20	Mm-hmm.
624	00:31:20	00:31:25	But mostly, I pretend to not know that my husband's having a weekly tryst with a stripper named Tangerine.
625	00:31:25	00:31:26	Mm-hmm.
626	00:31:26	00:31:29	Now, I did not kill Turk.
627	00:31:29	00:31:31	But I can tell you this...
628	00:31:31	00:31:35	I would kill to bring him back.
629	00:31:35	00:31:39	Did you know that-that Turk's blood was removed from his body after he was murdered?
630	00:31:39	00:31:47	And that suggests a Wiccan ritual or a spell, and that suggests you.
631	00:31:48	00:31:50	Golly.
632	00:31:50	00:31:53	When you people secret-shovel, you sure dig deep.
633	00:31:53	00:31:55	The coven said that we'd be persecuted.
634	00:31:55	00:31:57	No, slow-slow down.
635	00:31:57	00:32:01	I don't care who or what you worship, I just care about the truth.
636	00:32:01	00:32:02	I didn't kill Turk.
637	00:32:04	00:32:06	You said that the killer took Turk's blood.
638	00:32:06	00:32:09	Yes, that's right.
639	00:32:09	00:32:13	Our high priest thought that my relationship with Turk was-was a threat to the coven.
640	00:32:13	00:32:15	Your-your high priest?
641	00:32:18	00:32:19	Ed.
642	00:32:19	00:32:21	Ed, Ed Lusk?
643	00:32:21	00:32:22	The janitor?
644	00:32:22	00:32:24	He doesn't have power in this life.
645	00:32:24	00:32:26	He's determined to find power within the coven.
646	00:32:26	00:32:28	Turk was a threat to that power.
647	00:32:28	00:32:31	By having sex with you, he could create a-a scandal.
648	00:32:31	00:32:33	Ed said I was a bit...
649	00:32:33	00:32:34	reckless.
650	00:32:34	00:32:40	He would do anything to protect the coven, but I'm afraid if he took Turk's blood, that this goes way beyond that.
651	00:32:40	00:32:41	How so?
652	00:32:41	00:32:46	There's an ancient power spell called the Kratos.
653	00:32:46	00:32:48	It uses the blood of a sacrificed youth.
654	00:32:48	00:32:49	It goes back to the Druids.
655	00:32:49	00:32:58	To perform this-this Kratos spell, Ed would have to take Turk's blood to an altar, if-if I'm right. Yes.
656	00:32:58	00:32:59	The timing is very important.
657	00:32:59	00:33:02	The quicker the offering, the more powerful the spell.
658	00:33:02	00:33:09	The two attempts on Turk's life came at the school, so maybe Ed had a-an altar at the school?
659	00:33:09	00:33:11	Mm-hmm.
660	00:33:11	00:33:12	Do you know where it is?
661	00:33:17	00:33:19	Ed Lusk hasn't been seen since lunch.
662	00:33:20	00:33:24	Well, his ride's here, so he's probably around here somewhere.
663	00:33:26	00:33:29	All we have is an altar to the cleaning gods.
664	00:33:29	00:33:31	Not a Wiccan candle in sight.
665	00:33:34	00:33:36	Looks like our janitor missed something.
666	00:33:36	00:33:38	Directional blood drop.
667	00:33:38	00:33:41	Maybe a drip from the needle he used to draw Turk's blood.
668	00:33:42	00:33:44	I got another one here.
669	00:33:44	00:33:46	And here.
670	00:34:00	00:34:01	You don't belong here!
671	00:34:02	00:34:04	LVPD. Put down the knife.
672	00:34:04	00:34:07	We need you to come with us, Ed.
673	00:34:07	00:34:10	Put the knife down and no one gets hurt.
674	00:34:10	00:34:11	We just want to talk to you.
675	00:34:13	00:34:18	May the blackest of darkness smite you down into the ground.
676	00:34:18	00:34:19	Try me.
677	00:34:31	00:34:33	So, Ed Lusk has lawyered up.
678	00:34:33	00:34:35	High priest is not talking, huh?
679	00:34:35	00:34:36	The blood drops in his closet are.
680	00:34:36	00:34:38	DNA matches Turk.
681	00:34:38	00:34:39	Hope he's got a good lawyer.
682	00:34:39	00:34:40	Yeah, really. (rattling)
683	00:34:42	00:34:44	Ah, my brethren.
684	00:34:44	00:34:48	I was about to use the foul modern text device to summon you. What are you doing?
685	00:34:50	00:34:53	I beseech you to enter my sacred domain.
686	00:34:57	00:35:00	I welcome you on the day of the Mabon Moon...
687	00:35:00	00:35:01	David... ...whence we...
688	00:35:01	00:35:02	I'm tired.
689	00:35:02	00:35:04	I'm spell-casting to prove a point. Please.
690	00:35:04	00:35:05	Please.
691	00:35:05	00:35:07	Fine.
692	00:35:07	00:35:11	I understand that our high priest is mum, but his cauldron isn't.
693	00:35:11	00:35:17	I ran the ingredients found in it, discovered trace amounts of cherry opal gemstone.
694	00:35:18	00:35:23	Wiccans believe the cherry opal amplifies vibrational energies within the bloodstream.
695	00:35:23	00:35:30	We have been assuming that this is a power spell, but the truth is this soup's a healing spell.
696	00:35:30	00:35:31	So, what are you saying?
697	00:35:31	00:35:33	That Ed Lusk is sick?
698	00:35:33	00:35:35	No, but someone else is.
699	00:35:35	00:35:40	Someone who borrowed Turk's blood and availed themselves to Lusk's altar.
700	00:35:40	00:35:45	As I expected, I found Turk's blood in the cauldron.
701	00:35:45	00:35:50	But unexpectedly, I found a second blood contributor.
702	00:35:50	00:35:56	Not Lusk, but someone whose blood contains traces of methotrexate.
703	00:35:56	00:35:59	That's a chemo drug used to treat blood cancers.
704	00:35:59	00:36:01	Thou art correct.
705	00:36:01	00:36:03	And Henry hath run said blood.
706	00:36:03	00:36:10	He found a male familial match to touch DNA from a candle recovered from Messner's altar.
707	00:36:10	00:36:14	The match was not to Ed Lusk, but to a different wicked witch.
708	00:36:21	00:36:22	Ms. Brewer?
709	00:36:22	00:36:26	Haven't you asked my son enough questions?
710	00:36:26	00:36:26	Enough is enough.
711	00:36:26	00:36:30	We asked you to bring Mason here because we're concerned.
712	00:36:30	00:36:34	Concerned? About what will happen to him.
713	00:36:35	00:36:36	I don't understand.
714	00:36:38	00:36:41	You need to come with me, Mrs. Brewer.
715	00:36:42	00:36:43	Now.
716	00:36:49	00:36:51	We know that your son, Mason, is sick, Rebecca.
717	00:36:51	00:36:55	That he has Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
718	00:36:55	00:36:58	The blood cancer that affects children.
719	00:36:58	00:37:01	He missed a lot of school last semester.
720	00:37:01	00:37:04	His grades started to falter.
721	00:37:04	00:37:10	We know that he was receiving treatment, but you were seeking help of a higher power.
722	00:37:10	00:37:13	I'm not following.
723	00:37:13	00:37:14	We found Ed Lusk's cauldron.
724	00:37:14	00:37:18	We know that you're the one who prepared the ritual with your son's blood.
725	00:37:18	00:37:19	And Turk's.
726	00:37:19	00:37:20	You needed it to save Mason.
727	00:37:20	00:37:24	You're the one who killed Turk and Messner.
728	00:37:24	00:37:25	Your original plan wasn't too bad.
729	00:37:25	00:37:30	I mean, you heard the rumblings around school that Turk was looking for the Chem IV test answers.
730	00:37:30	00:37:32	It's pretty easy, setting him up.
731	00:37:32	00:37:36	This is you 16.
732	00:37:36	00:37:39	That's the same day that Chet Messner was killed.
733	00:37:39	00:37:44	19, you logged on to a computer using Hannah Hunt's password.
734	00:37:44	00:37:49	You logged on to VidTree, and you sent a message to Rob Turkla.
735	00:37:49	00:37:53	Telling him where to find the cheat sheet, but Messner found it instead.
736	00:37:53	00:37:56	And so you had to try and kill Rob again.
737	00:37:56	00:37:58	You knew Turk's schedule.
738	00:37:58	00:38:00	You knew where to find him.
739	00:38:08	00:38:11	Why, Rebecca?
740	00:38:11	00:38:13	Was Mason getting worse?
741	00:38:13	00:38:15	Why?
742	00:38:15	00:38:17	The cancer spread to his bones.
743	00:38:17	00:38:21	The doctor found vertical lesions and gave him six months to live.
744	00:38:21	00:38:25	So you were running out of time.
745	00:38:25	00:38:27	We get it.
746	00:38:27	00:38:30	Why does a piece of crap like Turk get to live?
747	00:38:30	00:38:32	Why does a good boy...
748	00:38:32	00:38:34	Why does your Mason have to die?
749	00:38:34	00:38:35	Where's the harmony in that?
750	00:38:35	00:38:37	We searched your car.
751	00:38:37	00:38:39	We found your Book of Shadows.
752	00:38:39	00:38:43	Inside there was a healing spell dedicated to Mason.
753	00:38:44	00:38:50	The spell's materials were all the same items that we found in Ed Lusk's cauldron.
754	00:38:50	00:38:52	I can...
755	00:38:52	00:38:56	Please. Listen, I know that you love your son.
756	00:38:56	00:38:57	No doubt.
757	00:38:57	00:38:58	It's all right here.
758	00:39:01	00:39:10	If I could set my own soul free to save you, I would, but I'm earthbound, so I can call on thee, gods.
759	00:39:10	00:39:15	Let the rising sun sear the cold serpent of disease.
760	00:39:15	00:39:16	My child...
761	00:39:18	00:39:20	...let the wind carry your pain away.
762	00:39:22	00:39:27	Let the waxing moon alight the darkness within you.
763	00:39:27	00:39:31	And let this blood of the powerful allow you to heal.
764	00:39:31	00:39:33	My son, you shall be reborn.
765	00:39:33	00:39:34	You shall be reborn.
766	00:39:34	00:39:38	My son doesn't deserve to die.
767	00:39:38	00:39:41	(sniffles) I'm not an evil person.
768	00:39:41	00:39:43	Ed told us that they were healing spells.
769	00:39:43	00:39:48	And-and medicine hadn't worked, and I was desperate to try anything.
770	00:39:48	00:39:50	Two people died because of this.
771	00:39:50	00:39:52	The Book of Shadows is very, very clear.
772	00:39:52	00:40:00	It says that a spell will only work if the sacrificed dies so that the other one can live.
773	00:40:02	00:40:04	I had to save my boy.
774	00:40:05	00:40:08	And you ended up losing him anyway.
775	00:40:13	00:40:15	Mason?
776	00:40:15	00:40:16	I'm so sorry.
777	00:40:16	00:40:17	Yeah.
778	00:40:17	00:40:20	There anybody I can call?
779	00:40:21	00:40:22	Any family?
780	00:40:22	00:40:25	Ever since my dad died, it's just been me and Mom.
781	00:40:25	00:40:31	This is when I get dumped in an orphanage with Oliver Twist, right?
782	00:40:31	00:40:33	No, that's not gonna happen.
783	00:40:33	00:40:35	Sure.
784	00:40:35	00:40:37	You still getting your treatments?
785	00:40:37	00:40:39	(sighs) Yeah.
786	00:40:39	00:40:41	I start a new round of chemo next month.
787	00:40:41	00:40:44	Doctors said they're gonna be tweaking the protocols.
788	00:40:46	00:40:49	Think maybe things might turn around.
789	00:40:52	00:40:57	I'm homeless, but I'm not hopeless.
790	00:40:57	00:41:00	He can stay with my family.
791	00:41:02	00:41:04	My parents already said it was okay.
792	00:41:06	00:41:08	Hannah, what...
793	00:41:08	00:41:09	What are you doing here?
794	00:41:12	00:41:13	I heard about your mom.
795	00:41:17	00:41:18	I'm really sorry.
796	00:41:18	00:41:20	Yeah, me, too.
797	00:41:22	00:41:29	You've always been really sweet to me, even when I was so mean to you.
798	00:41:34	00:41:36	And I couldn't be more sorry.
799	00:41:38	00:41:39	So...
800	00:41:39	00:41:42	if you want to play kick the can or something...
801	00:41:45	00:41:47	We're not little kids anymore, Hannah.
802	00:41:47	00:41:51	I know that, but...
803	00:41:51	00:41:53	what do you say?
804	00:42:04	00:42:05	Come on, let's go.
805	00:42:13	00:42:14	Poor kid.
806	00:42:14	00:42:18	How could a mother's love get so twisted?
807	00:42:18	00:42:21	Well, at least Hannah stepped up.
808	00:42:22	00:42:24	Kind of gives you hope, right?
809	00:42:27	00:42:28	That'd be nice.
