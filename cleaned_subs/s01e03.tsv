0	00:00:03	00:00:04	Congratulations, Nicky, my boy.
1	00:00:04	00:00:06	You are now a CSI Level Three.
2	00:00:06	00:00:07	Whoo!
3	00:00:07	00:00:08	Mommy?
4	00:00:08	00:00:11	I couldn’t drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
5	00:00:11	00:00:12	I love you too.
6	00:00:12	00:00:13	Sara Sidle?
7	00:00:13	00:00:15	I know who I am.
8	00:00:15	00:00:16	I think you’re a little confused.
9	00:00:16	00:00:18	I just off the phone with the Sheriff.
10	00:00:18	00:00:20	He says he wants me to run the unit.
11	00:00:20	00:00:21	You’re the boss.
12	00:00:21	00:00:23	They say I got to let you go.
13	00:00:23	00:00:24	I know.
14	00:00:27	00:00:29	I don’t care what the book says.
15	00:00:29	00:00:30	I lost one good person today.
16	00:00:30	00:00:32	I don’t want to lose another. Here.
17	00:01:17	00:01:18	Oh...
18	00:01:25	00:01:31	Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours, or your wife dies.
19	00:01:31	00:01:33	Stop me from taking the money-- she still dies.
20	00:01:33	00:01:37	This guy thinks it’s some kind of joke using a voice like that.
21	00:01:37	00:01:39	He’s altering his voice, sir, electronically.
22	00:01:39	00:01:40	We don’t consider it a joke at all.
23	00:01:40	00:01:42	Bring $2 million in hundreds...
24	00:01:42	00:01:44	You guys have listened to that tape like, 20 times.
25	00:01:44	00:01:46	Will somebody please go out and find my wife?
26	00:01:46	00:01:51	Mr. Garris, please, sometimes if you listen closely, you can hear a lot.
27	00:01:57	00:01:59	I don’t hear anything.
28	00:01:59	00:02:00	Right.
29	00:02:00	00:02:02	Where do you hear nothing in Las Vegas?
30	00:02:04	00:02:06	The desert.
31	00:02:06	00:02:13	And judging by what sounds like a low frequency buzz in the background, possibly near power lines.
32	00:02:13	00:02:14	How’d you hear all that?
33	00:02:14	00:02:16	I listen.
34	00:02:16	00:02:18	Right, okay, all right, got it.
35	00:02:18	00:02:19	I just spoke with the FBI.
36	00:02:19	00:02:22	They’ll back us up if we need it, but we have the handle.
37	00:02:22	00:02:24	Uh, Detective, wait.
38	00:02:24	00:02:26	What are my chances here...
39	00:02:26	00:02:27	...of-of Laura...
40	00:02:27	00:02:31	f-for Laura?
41	00:02:31	00:02:32	It’s a three-hour window.
42	00:02:33	00:02:35	Will somebody just tell me the truth?
43	00:02:35	00:02:44	A ransom message with a short fuse means that the victim’s situation will cause her to expire by or before the deadline, regardless of what we do.
44	00:02:44	00:02:46	In a car trunk-- that kind of thing.
45	00:02:46	00:02:50	It’s a form of passive murder, if you want to be, uh...
46	00:02:50	00:02:51	honest about it.
47	00:02:51	00:02:53	Then you guys have got to move.
48	00:02:53	00:02:59	Mr. Garris, it’s my experience that in situations like this, if you want to go fast, go slow.
49	00:03:34	00:03:36	Get a picture of the security pad.
50	00:03:36	00:03:40	Someone touches it before it’s dusted, I break their fingers.
51	00:03:40	00:03:43	Shoot the mirror-- point of disturbance.
52	00:03:43	00:03:46	The lamp--point of disturbance...
53	00:04:03	00:04:05	You’re standing in my crime scene.
54	00:04:05	00:04:07	No, you’re in mine.
55	00:04:07	00:04:09	You’re doing audio? I wanted that.
56	00:04:09	00:04:10	I outrank you.
57	00:04:10	00:04:12	Technicality-- who’d Grissom hand-pick to work here?
58	00:04:14	00:04:15	Keep telling yourself that.
59	00:04:18	00:04:20	Get the lights, will you?
60	00:04:20	00:04:21	Got it.
61	00:04:33	00:04:34	Shady friends?
62	00:04:34	00:04:39	No. Laura surrounds herself with quality people, people of real substance.
63	00:04:39	00:04:42	Has her behavior changed recently-- drug use, alcohol, things like that?
64	00:04:42	00:04:43	No, no, no, nothing like that.
65	00:04:43	00:04:45	She’s a health nut-- we both are.
66	00:04:45	00:04:46	Uh-huh.
67	00:04:50	00:04:51	Look, I’m a rich man.
68	00:04:51	00:04:55	How do we let this guy know I’ll pay?
69	00:04:55	00:04:56	We don’t want to go there yet.
70	00:05:00	00:05:05	Nick, tell lab to do a reverse algorithm on that tape and then get it into enhancement.
71	00:05:05	00:05:07	Yeah, I know what to tell the audio guy.
72	00:05:07	00:05:09	You’ve been a Level Three for what, two weeks?
73	00:05:09	00:05:12	I got it under control.
74	00:05:12	00:05:13	Swear.
75	00:05:14	00:05:16	Later.
76	00:05:24	00:05:28	Cursory call-- looks like a professional job.
77	00:05:28	00:05:36	Our guy bypasses the security system, surprises the wife in the back hall, drags her in here.
78	00:05:36	00:05:38	She grabs onto the doorway-- sign of struggle.
79	00:05:38	00:05:40	No sign of sexual assault.
80	00:05:40	00:05:43	He’s in, they’re out.
81	00:05:43	00:05:46	Probably...egress through those doors.
82	00:05:48	00:05:51	Excuse me, is my evaluation interrupting you?
83	00:05:51	00:05:53	No, no, no.
84	00:05:53	00:05:54	I barely heard you.
85	00:05:54	00:05:56	Glad I have a healthy ego.
86	00:05:56	00:05:59	You find something interesting there?
87	00:05:59	00:06:00	Dirt.
88	00:06:00	00:06:05	You’re so technical, I can hardly keep up, but...
89	00:06:05	00:06:07	Oh, sorry, but, uh...
90	00:06:07	00:06:11	out of context, it’s...just dirt.
91	00:06:22	00:06:25	Did you just slap on bad cologne?
92	00:06:25	00:06:28	I never wear it. It interferes with the job.
93	00:06:28	00:06:29	It’s almost sweet.
94	00:06:31	00:06:33	Hmm.
95	00:06:47	00:06:49	Can’t be chloroform.
96	00:06:49	00:06:50	Halothane, maybe.
97	00:06:50	00:06:53	We’ll confirm it in GC mass spec.
98	00:06:53	00:06:57	Looks like a professional job, I think you said.
99	00:06:57	00:06:59	Care to amend your evaluation?
100	00:06:59	00:07:02	I mean, if the guy forgets the rag he used to knock her out, he can’t be much of a pro.
101	00:07:02	00:07:05	I keep trying to be your star pupil.
102	00:07:05	00:07:07	Sara, that was a seminar.
103	00:07:07	00:07:09	This is real.
104	00:07:11	00:07:16	Pebbles, tile-- the front is all concrete.
105	00:07:16	00:07:18	No dirt.
106	00:07:18	00:07:20	Context--there is dirt on the carpeting inside.
107	00:07:20	00:07:22	In an otherwise spotless house.
108	00:07:22	00:07:25	You’re saying kidnapper tracked the dirt in.
109	00:07:25	00:07:26	Possible.
110	00:07:26	00:07:28	As of now, that’s about all we have, so...
111	00:07:29	00:07:31	I guess we follow the dirt.
112	00:07:43	00:07:45	How many hit-and-runs we had this year?
113	00:07:45	00:07:47	Too many.
114	00:07:47	00:07:50	One thing I can’t stand is a punk coward.
115	00:07:52	00:07:54	My daughter wants one of these scooters.
116	00:07:54	00:07:57	Says she’s the only kid in the world who doesn’t have one.
117	00:08:02	00:08:06	You want me to take this case alone?
118	00:08:06	00:08:07	You feeling all right, Warrick?
119	00:08:07	00:08:09	Oh, I’m fine.
120	00:08:09	00:08:12	I’m...I’m looking after you.
121	00:08:16	00:08:18	It’s that thing with Holly Gribbs.
122	00:08:18	00:08:22	It’s made me think of who I am to my partners, you know?
123	00:08:22	00:08:24	So this is what, your new leaf?
124	00:08:24	00:08:26	You keep on busting on me, you won’t see any kind of leaf.
125	00:08:26	00:08:29	Hey, relax, I’ll play nice.
126	00:08:29	00:08:30	Thank you for the offer.
127	00:08:30	00:08:34	I’m okay. I can handle this one.
128	00:08:34	00:08:38	It’d be nice if this paint transfer had just one special property.
129	00:08:41	00:08:42	You want to call it?
130	00:08:45	00:08:47	Vehicle’s humming down Rochester.
131	00:08:47	00:08:52	The vic was on her scooter, heading eastbound.
132	00:08:52	00:08:59	Car brakes here, impact here, the vic was thrown-- what, 20 meters?
133	00:09:02	00:09:06	And all we’ve got is some paint that’s gonna match up to about 20 million other vehicles.
134	00:09:06	00:09:09	Yeah.
135	00:09:09	00:09:10	Bastard.
136	00:09:10	00:09:13	Are you ordering me not to pay the ransom?
137	00:09:13	00:09:15	It’s a very strong suggestion, yes.
138	00:09:15	00:09:18	After you told me she could already be dead?
139	00:09:18	00:09:19	I don’t believe you guys.
140	00:09:19	00:09:21	This is my wife.
141	00:09:21	00:09:22	I’m paying the ransom.
142	00:09:22	00:09:26	Look, if you give up the cash, the kidnapper has no reason to communicate with us.
143	00:09:26	00:09:28	Does anyone on your team know where Laura is right now?
144	00:09:28	00:09:31	We have an entire forensics lab working on this.
145	00:09:31	00:09:34	Yeah? Something tells me I’ll see her before you do.
146	00:09:34	00:09:37	Well, your job just got harder.
147	00:09:37	00:09:38	Yeah.
148	00:09:38	00:09:39	I’ll stay close to the money.
149	00:09:43	00:09:45	This dirt has interesting properties.
150	00:09:45	00:09:48	The gold flecks-- that’s easy, it’s gold.
151	00:09:48	00:09:51	The little gray squiggles?
152	00:09:51	00:09:52	Cyanide.
153	00:09:52	00:09:54	Cyanide? He poisoned her.
154	00:09:54	00:09:55	No.
155	00:09:55	00:09:58	Did you know that Nevada produces 80% of the country’s gold?
156	00:09:58	00:10:03	Miners drop cyanide powder into the dirt and it draws the gold to the surface.
157	00:10:03	00:10:05	And how does a bug specialist know so much about dirt?
158	00:10:05	00:10:07	I had a case five years ago.
159	00:10:07	00:10:09	We found a skeleton in an abandoned gold mine.
160	00:10:09	00:10:10	I thought it was a murder.
161	00:10:10	00:10:17	Turned out the guy passed out drunk and the cyanide leached into his system.
162	00:10:17	00:10:18	Gruesome, Grissom.
163	00:10:20	00:10:23	You know, it’s funny, but every case teaches me something about the next.
164	00:10:23	00:10:25	So when you said, follow the dirt...?
165	00:10:25	00:10:28	Gold mine--it’s possible that’s where he’s got her.
166	00:10:28	00:10:30	Great, there’s got to be 100 gold mines in Nevada.
167	00:10:30	00:10:35	True, but how many are near power lines within range of the drop zone?
168	00:10:35	00:10:37	Three.
169	00:10:37	00:10:40	One, two, three.
170	00:10:43	00:10:45	This is your hit-and-run victim.
171	00:10:45	00:10:49	Bad thing about this job is, you stop asking yourself why.
172	00:10:51	00:10:53	Here’s the bruise I was telling you about.
173	00:10:56	00:10:57	You see it?
174	00:11:06	00:11:08	Oh, my God.
175	00:11:08	00:11:10	Plate numbers.
176	00:11:10	00:11:13	From the license plate when it impacted her skin.
177	00:11:13	00:11:17	Looks like a four and a J.
178	00:11:17	00:11:18	Yeah.
179	00:11:18	00:11:20	Not like he left us any evidence.
180	00:11:20	00:11:22	Call DMV.
181	00:11:22	00:11:27	I’ll get them to cross-check this partial within a five-mile radius, see how many ideas they come up with.
182	00:11:27	00:11:30	You’ll have those pictures for me? Yep.
183	00:11:30	00:11:31	I’ll meet you out front.
184	00:11:31	00:11:33	All right.
185	00:11:39	00:11:40	Freaky.
186	00:11:40	00:11:42	Is that what I think it is?
187	00:11:42	00:11:44	It’s a pack of coyotes.
188	00:11:44	00:11:48	The sensor picks up any form of body heat, two-legged or four-legged.
189	00:12:16	00:12:19	Captain Brass. Hey.
190	00:12:19	00:12:20	Geez, you scared me.
191	00:12:20	00:12:22	Sorry. Sorry.
192	00:12:22	00:12:23	Grissom told me to hook up with you.
193	00:12:23	00:12:25	He says the drop place will be a crime scene.
194	00:12:25	00:12:27	We hope.
195	00:12:32	00:12:35	Come on, give us something two-legged.
196	00:12:38	00:12:41	Last mine, we’ve circled it twice.
197	00:12:41	00:12:43	Yeah, well, we’ll circle it again.
198	00:12:51	00:12:54	Why don’t they move in on the guy?
199	00:12:54	00:12:57	Why? ’Cause he’s probably just walking his dog.
200	00:12:57	00:13:00	Well, he’s been there five minutes.
201	00:13:01	00:13:02	Dogs take their time.
202	00:13:02	00:13:05	What, do you want to be rushed?
203	00:13:05	00:13:15	Male in a ball cap, 10 Here, kitty, kitty...
204	00:13:15	00:13:16	Nobody moves, you got that?
205	00:13:16	00:13:18	Rock solid till my order.
206	00:13:18	00:13:19	Copy.
207	00:13:32	00:13:33	What was that?
208	00:13:33	00:13:37	Go back. Where?
209	00:13:37	00:13:38	There. Swing around!
210	00:13:44	00:13:46	My God, she’s below the surface.
211	00:13:46	00:13:47	Okay, let’s land!
212	00:13:47	00:13:49	Take her down! Down!
213	00:13:52	00:13:54	Ground team is right behind us.
214	00:13:54	00:13:55	I’ll guide them in.
215	00:13:58	00:13:59	She’s got to be right up here.
216	00:13:59	00:14:01	Mrs. Garris! Mrs. Garris!
217	00:14:01	00:14:03	Can you hear us?
218	00:14:03	00:14:04	Mrs. Garris!
219	00:14:04	00:14:08	We’re with the Las Vegas Police Department!
220	00:14:11	00:14:12	Here!
221	00:14:12	00:14:13	She’s here!
222	00:14:22	00:14:24	Got something here.
223	00:14:33	00:14:35	Come on! Get that end!
224	00:14:35	00:14:37	Yeah, come over!
225	00:14:40	00:14:41	Got to get her air!
226	00:14:41	00:14:43	Give me a pick, an ax.
227	00:14:48	00:14:49	Pull it!
228	00:14:55	00:14:57	Oh, my God.
229	00:14:58	00:15:00	Somebody get up behind her.
230	00:15:03	00:15:05	Okay, we’re gonna pull her up.
231	00:15:07	00:15:09	Sara, get me something to cut this tape.
232	00:15:09	00:15:11	Are you okay?
233	00:15:13	00:15:15	You’re gonna be okay now.
234	00:15:15	00:15:16	Get this off.
235	00:15:19	00:15:21	Okay.
236	00:15:29	00:15:31	You okay?
237	00:15:31	00:15:35	Never ceases to amaze me what people do to each other.
238	00:15:35	00:15:38	Transport the box to the lab for latents.
239	00:15:38	00:15:39	Hair fibers, get soil...
240	00:15:39	00:15:40	Victor-18.
241	00:15:40	00:15:43	Brass, do you hear me?
242	00:15:43	00:15:45	Copy.
243	00:15:45	00:15:47	We got the package and she’s still alive.
244	00:15:47	00:15:49	Brass, are you reading me? Over.
245	00:15:49	00:15:51	Victor-9, affirmative. Way to go.
246	00:15:51	00:15:53	Major player is in our sight.
247	00:15:53	00:15:55	Will update. Out.
248	00:15:55	00:15:57	You think that’s him?
249	00:15:57	00:16:00	You think that’s our guy right there?
250	00:16:08	00:16:09	Move on ball cap! Move, move, move!
251	00:16:13	00:16:15	Police officers, freeze!
252	00:16:15	00:16:17	Hey, no, I wasn’t stealing the bag, all right?
253	00:16:17	00:16:19	Hands on your head. Down on your knees!
254	00:16:19	00:16:21	Hold still.
255	00:16:21	00:16:23	Hey, look at the bag.
256	00:16:23	00:16:24	It’s not even leather.
257	00:16:24	00:16:26	Why would I want it?
258	00:16:26	00:16:29	I can think of about two million reasons, Tiger.
259	00:16:53	00:16:55	Hello.
260	00:16:55	00:16:57	Can I help you folks?
261	00:16:57	00:16:58	Mr. Charles Moore?
262	00:16:58	00:17:01	We’re with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
263	00:17:01	00:17:05	We’d like to talk to you about your car.
264	00:17:05	00:17:08	We believe it may have been involved in a traffic collision earlier this evening.
265	00:17:08	00:17:13	I told the police when they called, my car was stolen.
266	00:17:13	00:17:16	That’s why we have a search warrant, sir...
267	00:17:18	00:17:20	So that we can look in your garage.
268	00:17:35	00:17:38	It--it was an accident.
269	00:17:38	00:17:44	I saw the girl and I tried to break, but I accelerated by mistake.
270	00:17:44	00:17:46	I get confused.
271	00:17:47	00:17:48	I--I shouldn’t have left.
272	00:17:48	00:17:50	I was wrong.
273	00:17:51	00:17:53	Is she okay?
274	00:17:53	00:17:55	She died at the scene.
275	00:17:55	00:17:58	Oh, my God.
276	00:17:58	00:18:02	You’re going to be charged with manslaughter, Mr. Moore.
277	00:18:03	00:18:06	A felony hit-and-run.
278	00:18:06	00:18:10	Do you have a lawyer?
279	00:18:13	00:18:16	Catherine, I just got off the phone with the traffic guys.
280	00:18:16	00:18:17	They’ve impounded Moore’s car.
281	00:18:17	00:18:19	Should be here any minute.
282	00:18:19	00:18:22	Is it me, or did he give it up too easy?
283	00:18:22	00:18:24	Old guy was scared.
284	00:18:24	00:18:28	You have to see the birthday present I got for your daughter.
285	00:18:28	00:18:31	What’s the rule? How long do I have to be here before I start kicking in for gifts?
286	00:18:31	00:18:32	When the spirit moves you, Sara.
287	00:18:32	00:18:35	So, in your case, I guess, never.
288	00:18:35	00:18:37	I got one of these chem labs when I was six.
289	00:18:37	00:18:39	I almost blew up the whole house.
290	00:18:39	00:18:42	I hope you can return it, ’cause, uh, Lindsey doesn’t want a party.
291	00:18:42	00:18:43	Yeah, what kid doesn’t want a party?
292	00:18:43	00:18:47	Hey, Catherine what time’s your little girl coming by?
293	00:18:47	00:18:48	She isn’t.
294	00:18:48	00:18:50	Yeah, but I got her a chem set.
295	00:18:51	00:18:52	You keep that; might learn something.
296	00:18:52	00:18:55	Stop flirting with me. Cath, really, when’s the party?
297	00:18:55	00:18:57	What do I have to do--put it on the bulletin board?
298	00:18:57	00:18:58	There is no party.
299	00:18:58	00:18:59	My daughter doesn’t want a party.
300	00:18:59	00:19:02	Is everybody clear on that?
301	00:19:04	00:19:05	Our car’s here.
302	00:19:05	00:19:07	The burial box is in.
303	00:19:07	00:19:09	The victim’s ready at Desert Palm.
304	00:19:10	00:19:12	We’ll play with these later.
305	00:19:20	00:19:21	Thanks, guys.
306	00:19:21	00:19:22	No problem.
307	00:19:24	00:19:26	Garris Winery.
308	00:19:28	00:19:31	And you never saw the person, huh?
309	00:19:31	00:19:35	He...grabbed me from behind.
310	00:19:37	00:19:41	There was something clamped over my mouth.
311	00:19:41	00:19:44	That’s the last thing that I remember.
312	00:19:44	00:19:47	You know how you got the bruising around your eye?
313	00:19:47	00:19:50	I have no idea.
314	00:19:50	00:19:52	I’m sorry.
315	00:19:52	00:19:54	I was knocked out.
316	00:19:56	00:19:58	I just don’t think I can help you.
317	00:19:58	00:20:00	She’s been through enough; can we cut this short?
318	00:20:00	00:20:02	Sure.
319	00:20:02	00:20:05	I’d like to get a blood sample from you, though, if I could.
320	00:20:05	00:20:07	What for?
321	00:20:07	00:20:09	You’ve got scratches on your arm.
322	00:20:09	00:20:16	If we can find traces of your blood in Rundle’s truck, we can match the DNA, make our case against him that much stronger.
323	00:20:16	00:20:19	Come on, Grissom, you have the guy. Isn’t that enough?
324	00:20:19	00:20:22	Yeah, well, we didn’t get any prints off the duct tape.
325	00:20:22	00:20:24	Our audio guys are working on stuff.
326	00:20:24	00:20:29	Right now, we need something more concrete if we want to prove that he did it.
327	00:20:29	00:20:30	I want to help, Jack.
328	00:20:30	00:20:32	Okay, all right.
329	00:20:35	00:20:42	Whatever it takes to put this guy behind bars, I’ll do.
330	00:21:21	00:21:24	So you want to talk to us, no lawyer?
331	00:21:24	00:21:25	Why would I need a lawyer?
332	00:21:25	00:21:30	Look, I told you, I didn’t know there was any money in that bag.
333	00:21:30	00:21:31	Hit balls at that park twice a week.
334	00:21:31	00:21:32	Ask around.
335	00:21:32	00:21:35	And the fact that you’re Jack Garris’s trainer?
336	00:21:35	00:21:37	How does that mean I kidnapped his wife?
337	00:21:37	00:21:38	I know the dude.
338	00:21:38	00:21:40	Yeah.
339	00:21:42	00:21:44	And the layout of the guy’s house.
340	00:21:44	00:21:46	He pays extra for me to come to him.
341	00:21:46	00:21:50	You want to explain why we found your fingerprints all over the crate Laura Garris was buried in?
342	00:21:50	00:21:55	I... look, unless it was from Jack’s vineyard, I don’t know.
343	00:21:55	00:21:59	Helped him move some crates a couple weeks ago up to his garage.
344	00:21:59	00:22:01	I can’t believe...
345	00:22:01	00:22:03	Y-y-you got nothing to hold me on.
346	00:22:03	00:22:04	Going once, going twice...
347	00:22:04	00:22:08	sold...to the man walking out the front door.
348	00:22:09	00:22:11	Don’t go too far, pal.
349	00:22:11	00:22:12	My lawyer’s number.
350	00:22:12	00:22:15	In case you’d like to communicate with me again.
351	00:22:17	00:22:18	Hey, didn’t I see you on the news tonight?
352	00:22:18	00:22:22	The chopper, you were digging up Jack’s wife?
353	00:22:22	00:22:23	It’s amazing.
354	00:22:23	00:22:25	Hope you catch the guy.
355	00:22:25	00:22:26	Me too.
356	00:22:28	00:22:30	So?
357	00:22:30	00:22:32	Ah, kid didn’t give up a thing...
358	00:22:32	00:22:34	except the tape that’ll break the case open.
359	00:22:34	00:22:36	Did you let him know you were recording him?
360	00:22:36	00:22:40	Yeah, the guy has no idea what you science types can do with a little audio tape.
361	00:22:40	00:22:42	Thank you.
362	00:22:47	00:22:49	How tall you do you think Mr. Moore is?
363	00:22:50	00:22:52	Six feet, I’d say.
364	00:22:52	00:22:57	Well, old people must love hugging that steering wheel ’cause this seat is pushed all the way forward.
365	00:22:59	00:23:01	Oh!
366	00:23:01	00:23:02	Oh...
367	00:23:04	00:23:07	Well, I’m six feet, and this mirror isn’t helping me at all.
368	00:23:09	00:23:11	Start the car.
369	00:23:11	00:23:12	Why?
370	00:23:12	00:23:13	Just do it.
371	00:23:19	00:23:22	Mr. Moore was not the last person to drive this car.
372	00:23:25	00:23:28	Uh, turn the music off.
373	00:23:28	00:23:30	This? Yeah.
374	00:23:30	00:23:32	It’s good stuff.
375	00:23:32	00:23:36	Nobody over 19 was the last person to drive this car.
376	00:23:37	00:23:39	Yeah.
377	00:23:39	00:23:41	Hey, just in time.
378	00:23:41	00:23:43	We’re giving it a final run.
379	00:23:43	00:23:48	Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours or your wife dies.
380	00:23:48	00:23:51	Stop me from taking the money-- she still dies.
381	00:23:51	00:23:55	This is the end of the same tape after a reverse algorithmic.
382	00:23:55	00:23:59	Stop me from taking the money-- she still dies.
383	00:23:59	00:24:01	Sounds like our guy to me.
384	00:24:01	00:24:02	It is.
385	00:24:02	00:24:04	Now, ransom tape against your exemplar.
386	00:24:04	00:24:06	You got it loaded up, THD?
387	00:24:06	00:24:08	Right here.
388	00:24:08	00:24:11	Look, unless it was from Jack’s vineyard, I don’t know.
389	00:24:11	00:24:14	Helped him move some crates couple weeks ago up to his garage.
390	00:24:14	00:24:15	Survey says...
391	00:24:15	00:24:18	perfect match to the naked ear.
392	00:24:18	00:24:24	Now, where’s my spectrograph, so the defense attorneys can’t claim that our alterations were altered?
393	00:24:24	00:24:26	Right here.
394	00:24:26	00:24:30	Uh, yellow lines with the ransom message-- blue’s the interview.
395	00:24:33	00:24:35	There’s something wrong.
396	00:24:35	00:24:36	There’s just a green line.
397	00:24:36	00:24:40	That’s ’cause the blue line is directly on top of the yellow line, which makes it green.
398	00:24:40	00:24:42	It’s a perfect match.
399	00:24:42	00:24:43	We got our kidnapper.
400	00:24:43	00:24:45	What do you do now, Nick?
401	00:24:45	00:24:50	I’ll call Brass, tell him to go pick the guy up. But you tell Brass to drag his heels, ’cause you still got work to do.
402	00:24:50	00:24:52	Grissom, can you look at something out back?
403	00:24:52	00:24:53	Could be big.
404	00:24:53	00:24:54	Yeah.
405	00:24:54	00:24:56	Come see me after you raise Brass.
406	00:24:59	00:25:01	What’d I do wrong?
407	00:25:01	00:25:02	I’m not gonna spoil Grissom’s fun.
408	00:25:02	00:25:05	This is how he teaches all you guys.
409	00:25:05	00:25:09	Does anybody else drive your car, Mr. Moore?
410	00:25:09	00:25:10	I was driving yesterday.
411	00:25:10	00:25:13	Sir, that doesn’t answer our question.
412	00:25:15	00:25:16	Pops...
413	00:25:16	00:25:19	Hey, you okay?
414	00:25:19	00:25:21	What’s he doing here?
415	00:25:21	00:25:24	Your grandson is an approved driver on your insurance.
416	00:25:24	00:25:26	We had him pulled out of school.
417	00:25:27	00:25:30	So, James, you like Mos Def?
418	00:25:35	00:25:37	Did you hit that girl with your grandfather’s car?
419	00:25:41	00:25:44	Pops, let me explain to them. No.
420	00:25:44	00:25:45	They should hear what happened.
421	00:25:45	00:25:47	They’re going to... from me.
422	00:25:52	00:25:54	I asked James to drive with me.
423	00:25:54	00:25:58	I don’t do so good, night driving.
424	00:25:58	00:26:05	When I hit that girl, I got knocked woozy, and James switched seats and took over the wheel...
425	00:26:05	00:26:07	got me home.
426	00:26:07	00:26:11	He was worried about me, not the girl.
427	00:26:11	00:26:15	One more moving violation, and they take away my keys.
428	00:26:16	00:26:23	I’m not saying good judgment was used, but that’s what happened.
429	00:26:23	00:26:26	James, you want to add anything to that?
430	00:26:28	00:26:30	No.
431	00:26:30	00:26:32	That’s how it was.
432	00:26:37	00:26:40	Will you please escort Mr. Moore back to his cell?
433	00:26:42	00:26:43	Sir.
434	00:26:45	00:26:48	I’ll come see you with a lawyer.
435	00:26:48	00:26:50	Just not during school hours.
436	00:26:50	00:26:52	I won’t.
437	00:27:05	00:27:06	James.
438	00:27:06	00:27:08	You have family, someone you can call?
439	00:27:08	00:27:10	It’s just the two of us.
440	00:27:10	00:27:12	We can give you a lift home.
441	00:27:12	00:27:15	Thanks--no.
442	00:27:15	00:27:16	I’ll take the bus.
443	00:27:22	00:27:24	You know that James was riding solo that night.
444	00:27:27	00:27:30	Like I know my middle name.
445	00:27:30	00:27:32	Well, let’s go back to the car and find the proof.
446	00:27:36	00:27:38	What?
447	00:27:38	00:27:41	It’s just that we’ve got so much power in this job, which we use to get the bad guys.
448	00:27:41	00:27:47	Once in a while, I’d like to use it to help the good guys, like Mr. Moore and his grandson.
449	00:27:47	00:27:50	And what, forget about little Renda Harris?
450	00:27:50	00:27:52	No...
451	00:27:54	00:27:56	What I’m saying is that...
452	00:27:56	00:27:59	putting James away isn’t gonna bring her back.
453	00:27:59	00:28:02	Mr. Moore is willing to do the time.
454	00:28:02	00:28:05	And the victim’s family gets closure.
455	00:28:05	00:28:09	Hey, you don’t think I’m feeling this?
456	00:28:09	00:28:13	But we got to follow the evidence, even if we don’t like where it takes us.
457	00:28:16	00:28:17	It’s the job.
458	00:28:19	00:28:21	Yeah.
459	00:28:21	00:28:22	I know it.
460	00:28:23	00:28:29	Hey, we start making deals with the Devil and you don’t get to walk away.
461	00:28:29	00:28:30	You understand what I’m saying?
462	00:28:30	00:28:32	Yeah.
463	00:28:34	00:28:35	Momentary lapse.
464	00:28:39	00:28:42	I want you to find something new on that tape.
465	00:28:42	00:28:43	Like what?
466	00:28:43	00:28:44	We already matched the guy’s voice.
467	00:28:44	00:28:46	You know what the defense attorneys will do with that?
468	00:28:46	00:28:48	That’s who you’re up against in the end.
469	00:28:48	00:28:50	You think I don’t know that?
470	00:28:50	00:28:53	Ah, you been second- guessing me ever since I got on this case.
471	00:28:53	00:28:54	People leave us clues, Nick.
472	00:28:54	00:28:56	They speak to us in thousands of different ways.
473	00:28:56	00:28:59	It’s our job to make sure that we’ve heard everything they’ve said.
474	00:28:59	00:29:00	Anything less is reasonable doubt.
475	00:29:00	00:29:02	I’ll go back to the tape.
476	00:29:05	00:29:07	You any better?
477	00:29:07	00:29:08	What are you talking about?
478	00:29:08	00:29:14	Your little major-minor blow-up about Lindsey not wanting a party.
479	00:29:14	00:29:16	Oh, that.
480	00:29:16	00:29:18	Yeah.
481	00:29:19	00:29:23	I’m just afraid that I’m making her weird, you know?
482	00:29:23	00:29:25	No.
483	00:29:25	00:29:27	I work 24/7.
484	00:29:27	00:29:29	I have no time for my friends.
485	00:29:29	00:29:37	My daughter rarely sees me having any fun, and all of a sudden, she doesn’t want a party.
486	00:29:37	00:29:38	And that’s because of you?
487	00:29:38	00:29:40	Yes, I’m her mother.
488	00:29:40	00:29:42	She mimics me.
489	00:29:42	00:29:44	Well, then she’ll be fine.
490	00:29:44	00:29:46	I mean, look at you.
491	00:29:49	00:29:51	You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
492	00:29:51	00:29:54	Yeah.
493	00:29:54	00:29:55	Hey, Grissom...
494	00:29:55	00:29:56	could you come tape me up?
495	00:29:59	00:30:00	I love my work.
496	00:30:00	00:30:02	It shows.
497	00:30:10	00:30:13	So you found Laura’s hairs here...
498	00:30:13	00:30:15	passenger side, front seat?
499	00:30:15	00:30:17	Right, not in the back.
500	00:30:17	00:30:23	Which made me ask, what kind of a kidnapper puts a woman bound and unconscious in the front seat?
501	00:30:23	00:30:26	The back of my arm isn’t touching the sheepskin, see?
502	00:30:26	00:30:27	Yeah, so?
503	00:30:27	00:30:30	But there is sheepskin fiber on the back of Laura’s sleeve.
504	00:30:30	00:30:34	That tells us Laura sat back like a normal person would.
505	00:30:34	00:30:36	Cut me, Mick.
506	00:30:40	00:30:41	Like this.
507	00:30:41	00:30:43	So she wasn’t bound at all?
508	00:30:43	00:30:44	Correct.
509	00:30:44	00:30:51	But would a kidnapper risk putting an unconscious woman in the front seat of his car, even unbound?
510	00:30:51	00:30:54	Answer is usually in the question-- you taught me that.
511	00:30:54	00:30:56	So was she unconscious?
512	00:30:56	00:30:58	We found halothane on the patio.
513	00:30:58	00:31:01	Halothane knocks you out, if you take it.
514	00:31:01	00:31:04	So you’re saying she never inhaled the halothane?
515	00:31:04	00:31:05	Proof would be in her blood.
516	00:31:05	00:31:08	Halothane stays in the system up to 48 hours.
517	00:31:08	00:31:12	How pleased am I that I got a sample of her blood?
518	00:31:12	00:31:15	So you can go check at the lab, see how it turned out.
519	00:31:15	00:31:17	Damn it, I wanted to carry the ball over the line.
520	00:31:17	00:31:19	I know.
521	00:31:19	00:31:21	We just picked up our kidnapper, Chip.
522	00:31:21	00:31:23	What’s up?
523	00:31:23	00:31:25	His lawyer was at his house and wants to make a deal.
524	00:31:25	00:31:26	No deals.
525	00:31:26	00:31:27	We know what Chip has to offer.
526	00:31:27	00:31:29	Oh, yeah, Kreskin, what’s that?
527	00:31:29	00:31:31	Laura Garris.
528	00:31:31	00:31:32	The victim.
529	00:31:33	00:31:35	The accomplice.
530	00:31:42	00:31:44	Hey!
531	00:31:44	00:31:45	You got something that can’t wait, Nick?
532	00:31:45	00:31:49	Yeah, the ransom tape enhanced-- mega enhanced.
533	00:31:49	00:31:51	Good. I’ll listen to it right now.
534	00:31:51	00:31:52	All right.
535	00:31:52	00:31:54	Hey, I just...
536	00:31:54	00:31:56	I didn’t know there was more to look for, you know?
537	00:31:56	00:31:57	You did it.
538	00:31:57	00:32:01	It doesn’t matter how we got here.
539	00:32:01	00:32:02	Just remember this.
540	00:32:23	00:32:29	When you want evidence, you can’t find it, and when you don’t want it, it’s as big as Dallas.
541	00:32:29	00:32:32	What you got?
542	00:32:32	00:32:34	Can you tell what that is?
543	00:32:34	00:32:38	My Aunt Bertha could tell, and she’s legally blind.
544	00:32:39	00:32:42	You want to look at my teeth?
545	00:32:42	00:32:44	What kind of investigation is this?
546	00:32:44	00:32:46	A forensic investigation, sir.
547	00:32:46	00:32:47	Fine.
548	00:32:47	00:32:49	You look at my teeth.
549	00:32:53	00:32:54	Give them back when you’re done.
550	00:32:59	00:33:01	James...
551	00:33:01	00:33:06	We found a tooth chip embedded in the steering wheel of your grandfather’s car.
552	00:33:06	00:33:11	It doesn’t appear to be, uh, from your grandfather’s teeth.
553	00:33:15	00:33:16	James...
554	00:33:16	00:33:17	You have a chipped tooth?
555	00:33:20	00:33:23	Must be an incisor, or we would have noticed.
556	00:33:24	00:33:26	Pops, I’m sorry, but I got to.
557	00:33:29	00:33:32	He’s a good boy.
558	00:33:32	00:33:34	It was an accident.
559	00:33:36	00:33:38	I make him call...
560	00:33:38	00:33:44	let me know where he is, especially when he’s out after dark.
561	00:33:46	00:33:49	Hey, Pops, it’s me.
562	00:33:49	00:33:51	Tips were good.
563	00:33:51	00:33:54	Hey, I thought I’d go check out a movie over at the Plex.
564	00:33:56	00:33:57	Okay.
565	00:33:57	00:34:00	See you later.
566	00:34:13	00:34:18	He drove straight home and wanted me to go to the police station with him.
567	00:34:18	00:34:21	I didn’t know that little girl was dead.
568	00:34:21	00:34:23	I swear.
569	00:34:23	00:34:25	I didn’t know what to do.
570	00:34:28	00:34:29	I knew Pops would know.
571	00:34:29	00:34:32	I wouldn’t let him turn himself in.
572	00:34:32	00:34:33	That was my decision.
573	00:34:33	00:34:36	Boy’s going places, college...
574	00:34:36	00:34:37	He’s got a real future.
575	00:34:37	00:34:40	I’m very sorry, Mr. Moore.
576	00:34:40	00:34:44	James, I’m afraid you’re gonna have to be taken into custody.
577	00:34:44	00:34:46	Miss, please, now, I’m willing to serve his time.
578	00:34:46	00:34:48	I know you are, Mr. Moore.
579	00:34:48	00:34:49	We can’t let you do that.
580	00:34:49	00:34:51	I made him cover it up. That was my decision.
581	00:34:51	00:34:53	He can explain all that to court.
582	00:34:53	00:34:55	I’ll be a witness.
583	00:34:57	00:34:59	We both will.
584	00:35:13	00:35:16	Hey...why don’t you run on home?
585	00:35:16	00:35:18	I’ll handle this.
586	00:35:18	00:35:21	Is this more of your new leaf?
587	00:35:21	00:35:24	Your daughter gets out of school in a half hour, right?
588	00:35:24	00:35:26	On her birthday.
589	00:35:26	00:35:28	Why do you want to pick a fight with me now?
590	00:35:30	00:35:31	I owe you.
591	00:35:31	00:35:34	Don’t think I won’t collect.
592	00:35:37	00:35:40	Grateful Dead CD?
593	00:35:40	00:35:41	Who’s dead?
594	00:35:41	00:35:45	No halothane in Laura Garris’ blood, which proves she was never knocked out.
595	00:35:45	00:35:46	She went willingly.
596	00:35:46	00:35:50	She and Chip faked her kidnapping, which, of course, makes no sense at all.
597	00:35:50	00:35:53	Because she ended up under ground in a box.
598	00:35:53	00:35:55	With a black eye.
599	00:35:55	00:35:57	Any theories?
600	00:35:58	00:36:00	Greed.
601	00:36:00	00:36:02	That’s ridiculous.
602	00:36:02	00:36:05	I didn’t even know Chip Rundle except that he’s Jack’s trainer.
603	00:36:05	00:36:07	But you became pretty good friends, didn’t you?
604	00:36:07	00:36:09	No.
605	00:36:09	00:36:11	Jack...no.
606	00:36:11	00:36:13	I believe my wife.
607	00:36:13	00:36:16	Thing is, Jack, I tend not to believe people.
608	00:36:16	00:36:17	People lie.
609	00:36:17	00:36:19	The evidence doesn’t lie.
610	00:36:19	00:36:26	You and Chip made a plan to run away together with your hard-earned millions, Jack.
611	00:36:26	00:36:29	Divorce--just too long and messy.
612	00:36:29	00:36:34	Anyway, the plan was surprisingly well thought out.
613	00:36:34	00:36:36	Don’t move.
614	00:36:36	00:36:37	Ooh...
615	00:36:39	00:36:40	Go on, say it. No, no!
616	00:36:40	00:36:41	Say it!
617	00:36:41	00:36:43	What?
618	00:36:43	00:36:44	Say the words.
619	00:36:44	00:36:46	I love you.
620	00:36:50	00:36:53	Put this on.
621	00:36:53	00:36:54	A lot of it.
622	00:36:56	00:36:58	You were in, you were out.
623	00:36:58	00:37:03	Oh, and you dropped that halothane rag to make sure we’d find it and know you were unconscious-- a real victim.
624	00:37:03	00:37:07	Jack, all due respect, she’s anything but.
625	00:37:07	00:37:08	Oh, really?
626	00:37:08	00:37:11	Then how did I end up buried alive, scared to death?
627	00:37:11	00:37:13	We’re getting to that.
628	00:37:13	00:37:18	You and Chip drove out of town, she sat in the front seat, unbound, fully conscious.
629	00:37:18	00:37:20	They stopped at a roadside phone.
630	00:37:20	00:37:27	Chipper called in the ransom message and I think you were still in the truck then, right, Laura?
631	00:37:27	00:37:29	Whatever. This is your thing.
632	00:37:29	00:37:30	Pay attention.
633	00:37:30	00:37:32	It’s about to become yours.
634	00:37:32	00:37:34	Then you both drove east towards Sandfill Mine.
635	00:37:34	00:37:39	He probably told you about some little line shack or something where you could stay while he picked up the ransom money.
636	00:37:39	00:37:43	But then, all of a sudden, he pulled over, probably made some excuse.
637	00:37:46	00:37:48	Chip...what are we doing?
638	00:37:48	00:37:50	Switching cars, covering our tracks.
639	00:37:50	00:37:54	I got a Jeep up over this hill.
640	00:37:54	00:37:55	Where?
641	00:37:55	00:38:01	I bet right away in your gut you knew something was up, and then, just a few minutes later, you knew for sure.
642	00:38:09	00:38:12	That’s when I believe you got your black eye.
643	00:38:12	00:38:13	I, uh...
644	00:38:13	00:38:14	I don’t remember.
645	00:38:14	00:38:16	And then, finally, you were unconscious.
646	00:38:16	00:38:19	He duct-taped your hands and he buried you.
647	00:38:19	00:38:23	Guess he figured why split $2 million when he can dump you and have it all.
648	00:38:23	00:38:24	Laura?
649	00:38:24	00:38:27	Jack, it’s not true. I had no part in it.
650	00:38:27	00:38:31	Audio downloaded everything. Dubs are queued up.
651	00:38:31	00:38:33	Let’s listen to Chip’s message, okay?
652	00:38:33	00:38:37	Remember, Jack, when I told you you could hear a lot if you listened?
653	00:38:37	00:38:38	Yeah.
654	00:38:38	00:38:43	Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours \or your wife dies.
655	00:38:43	00:38:47	Stop me from taking the money, she still dies.
656	00:38:47	00:38:50	I’m sure you all recognize Chip’s voice unaltered.
657	00:38:50	00:38:54	Now, one more time with a slight variation.
658	00:38:54	00:38:58	It’s amazing what we can do with the new forensic audio programs.
659	00:38:58	00:39:00	Enhance sounds, isolate them.
660	00:39:00	00:39:03	Heck, we can lift entire speeches just to see what’s underneath.
661	00:39:07	00:39:10	A car went by when Chip was on the phone to you, Jack.
662	00:39:10	00:39:12	Scared you, didn’t it, Laura?
663	00:39:12	00:39:14	Thought it might be the police?
664	00:39:16	00:39:22	Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours or your wife dies.
665	00:39:24	00:39:26	Let’s hear it once more without that annoying car.
666	00:39:28	00:39:31	Chip, hurry up.
667	00:39:37	00:39:39	You’re my whole life.
668	00:39:39	00:39:40	Please, Jack.
669	00:39:40	00:39:42	Your work is your life.
670	00:39:42	00:39:46	How else do you think I started sleeping with Chip right under your nose?
671	00:39:48	00:39:49	All right, let’s go, Laura.
672	00:39:49	00:39:51	Officer has a car waiting out front.
673	00:39:51	00:39:53	Just wait, just wait a second.
674	00:39:53	00:39:54	Grissom, I can help you.
675	00:39:54	00:39:56	I can get you Chip not just on this.
676	00:39:56	00:40:00	He was into a lot of things-- steroids--he was into credit cards.
677	00:40:00	00:40:04	We already have you both for about 25 years, minimum.
678	00:40:20	00:40:23	There’s one thing you didn’t explain in there.
679	00:40:23	00:40:26	As soon as you dug Laura up, why didn’t she turn Chip in?
680	00:40:26	00:40:27	Self-preservation.
681	00:40:27	00:40:30	She rats on him, she rats on herself.
682	00:40:50	00:40:52	So did you have a good day at school?
683	00:40:52	00:40:55	Yeah. Three friends made be birthday cards.
684	00:40:55	00:40:56	They did?
685	00:40:56	00:40:59	Well, you have got some great friends.
686	00:40:59	00:41:04	So, Lindsey... how come you didn’t want to have a party with them?
687	00:41:04	00:41:06	I see my friends everyday at school.
688	00:41:06	00:41:09	I never get to be alone with you.
689	00:41:09	00:41:13	Oh... wow...
690	00:41:13	00:41:16	Well, I’m really glad to be alone with you too.
691	00:41:16	00:41:18	I like this more than you will ever know.
692	00:41:18	00:41:19	Come on, man.
693	00:41:21	00:41:22	I’m coming!
694	00:41:22	00:41:26	Are you going to get me one of those for my birthday?
695	00:41:26	00:41:30	Uh, maybe when you’re older.
696	00:41:30	00:41:31	Like, 40.
697	00:41:31	00:41:32	Mommy!
698	00:41:32	00:41:34	Whatee? That’s not fair.
699	00:41:34	00:41:36	I know it’s not fair.
700	00:41:36	00:41:37	Life isn’t fair.
701	00:41:50	00:41:52	Don’t worry, Pops.
702	00:41:52	00:41:54	I’ll be okay.
703	00:41:56	00:41:59	My grandson going to jail is never okay.
704	00:42:04	00:42:06	You stay alive in there.
705	00:42:06	00:42:08	You hear me?
706	00:42:11	00:42:13	You too.
707	00:42:13	00:42:16	Don’t be going downhill.
708	00:42:38	00:42:40	Hold on.
709	00:42:40	00:42:42	James...
710	00:42:43	00:42:47	The first couple days are going to be the toughest.
711	00:42:47	00:42:48	Here.
712	00:42:48	00:42:50	Here’s my cell number.
713	00:42:52	00:42:57	If you run into any problems, you call me.
714	00:42:58	00:43:00	I’ll be right there.
715	00:43:00	00:43:02	All right?
716	00:43:02	00:43:05	Keep your head up.
717	00:43:23	00:43:27	You didn’t have to do that-- give James your number.
718	00:43:29	00:43:32	I’ve seen other law enforcement people in my day...

722	00:43:39	00:43:42	She used to call me her work in progress.
723	00:43:42	00:43:48	Yeah. Well... she did something right.
724	00:43:51	00:43:52	Maybe.
