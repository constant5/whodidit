2,00:00:19,00:00:21,(cawing)
3,00:00:24,00:00:28,(cawing)
4,00:00:31,00:00:33,(cawing continues)
5,00:00:41,00:00:44,I don't think I can get a clear shot.
6,00:00:45,00:00:46,It's a peregrine falcon.
7,00:00:46,00:00:48,"No, it's not. It's a hawk."
8,00:00:48,00:00:50,You can't see anything this time of day.
9,00:00:50,00:00:52,We should come back at dawn.
10,00:00:52,00:00:53,But I'm so behind on my life list.
11,00:00:53,00:00:56,I still don't have a western wood-pewee or a solitary sandpiper.
12,00:00:56,00:00:58,"What, do you think they're going to kick you out of the club?"
13,00:00:58,00:01:00,John saw a dickcissel earlier today.
14,00:01:00,00:01:01,It could be gone tomorrow.
15,00:01:01,00:01:02,John's full of...
16,00:01:02,00:01:03,(cawing)
17,00:01:04,00:01:06,Corvus corax.
18,00:01:06,00:01:08,A common raven?
19,00:01:08,00:01:09,So what?
20,00:01:09,00:01:11,(cawing)
21,00:01:26,00:01:28,"GRISSOM: Well, someone's missing a contact lens."
22,00:01:28,00:01:31,WILLOWS: That's not all they're missing.
23,00:01:31,00:01:36,"You know, ravens, like eagles, have been known to travel 30 miles from roost to feeding ground."
24,00:01:37,00:01:40,30 miles in every direction.
25,00:01:40,00:01:42,pi-r-squared.
26,00:01:42,00:01:45,That means that we're looking at a...
27,00:01:45,00:01:47,"2,800 mile search area."
28,00:01:49,00:01:59,"""Once upon a midnight dreary ""While I pondered ""Weak and weary ""Over many a quaint and curious Volume of forgotten lore."" We're up a tree and you're quoting Poe."
29,00:01:59,00:02:00,Give me something.
30,00:02:01,00:02:05,"""Quoth the Raven, 'Only this..."
31,00:02:05,00:02:07,and nothing more.
32,00:03:00,00:03:02,(cawing)
33,00:03:52,00:03:56,You'll be pleased to know the eyeball was only slightly desiccated.
34,00:03:56,00:03:58,And what about the iris?
35,00:03:58,00:03:59,Still blue.
36,00:03:59,00:04:03,Color distinction means the body's been dead less than 48 hours.
37,00:04:03,00:04:06,"Yeah, I sent some vitreous fluid to tox."
38,00:04:06,00:04:07,The rest to DNA.
39,00:04:07,00:04:11,Can you get me an eye for an eye?
40,00:04:11,00:04:18,"Well, I've got foil a leaf, a feather and plastic."
41,00:04:21,00:04:23,Feathers.
42,00:04:23,00:04:24,For warmth.
43,00:04:25,00:04:26,Seagull feathers.
44,00:04:27,00:04:31,"Well, the only place we'd have seagulls around here would be Lake Mead."
45,00:04:31,00:04:33,But only when the fishing's good.
46,00:04:33,00:04:36,And we got some ground limestone.
47,00:04:37,00:04:39,Not found at Lake Mead.
48,00:04:41,00:04:44,"You know, ravens are incredibly intelligent."
49,00:04:44,00:04:47,They have a brain capacity comparable to dolphins.
50,00:04:47,00:04:50,Means they know where to shop.
51,00:04:50,00:04:51,We found the eye here.
52,00:04:51,00:04:57,I bet she shopped here where limestone is used as ground cover.
53,00:05:08,00:05:15,SIDLE: You know the average Nevadan generates more waste more than three times waste than the average American?
54,00:05:15,00:05:17,"Yeah, well, that's tourist trash."
55,00:05:17,00:05:19,13 million pounds per day.
56,00:05:19,00:05:22,I went to the recycling forum in March.
57,00:05:22,00:05:25,The landfill manager says this is the active cell.
58,00:05:25,00:05:28,Spotter says cell lift moves forward 20 feet a day.
59,00:05:28,00:05:30,That puts the active cell right...
60,00:05:30,00:05:32,pretty much in front of us.
61,00:05:32,00:05:36,Man! You find the best evidence in the nastiest places.
62,00:05:36,00:05:38,You are what you throw away.
63,00:05:38,00:05:43,It's like peeling an onion into peoples' lives.
64,00:05:43,00:05:47,"Well, this onion is our time line so peel back accordingly."
65,00:05:53,00:05:57,ROBBINS: The electrolyte and glucose levels in the eye were normal.
66,00:05:58,00:06:01,Means your victim wasn't dehydrated or diabetic.
67,00:06:01,00:06:02,Other than that...
68,00:06:02,00:06:04,We're flying blind.
69,00:06:06,00:06:07,David.
70,00:06:07,00:06:09,Grissom.
71,00:06:11,00:06:13,A 35-year-old male.
72,00:06:13,00:06:14,Car salesman.
73,00:06:14,00:06:16,Dropped dead at work.
74,00:06:16,00:06:17,Apparent heart attack.
75,00:06:17,00:06:19,Not under the care of a physician.
76,00:06:19,00:06:22,"Uh, no history of high blood pressure."
77,00:06:22,00:06:25,Just routine autopsy.
78,00:06:27,00:06:29,Go for it.
79,00:06:30,00:06:31,"Yeah, we're all set, Dr. Robbins."
80,00:06:32,00:06:34,"Okay, David."
81,00:06:34,00:06:37,Case 03-615.
82,00:06:37,00:06:39,Postmortem exam of an adult.
83,00:06:39,00:06:41,Caucasian. Male.
84,00:06:41,00:06:44,Identified as Fred Stearns.
85,00:06:44,00:06:46,Body received warm to the touch.
86,00:06:46,00:06:49,Rigor mortis not present.
87,00:06:49,00:06:54,"Skull nose, bones are intact by palpation."
88,00:06:54,00:06:57,Irides are brown.
89,00:06:57,00:06:59,Slightly congested.
90,00:06:59,00:07:01,Hmm.
91,00:07:01,00:07:07,Unidentified dry black substance on the front of the teeth. gingiva and lips.
92,00:07:07,00:07:11,"Okay. David, open him up."
93,00:07:26,00:07:28,Uh... D-Dr. Robbins?
94,00:07:28,00:07:30,"Sir, I-I have blood."
95,00:07:31,00:07:32,I have bleeding.
96,00:07:34,00:07:37,Get me my kit.
97,00:07:37,00:07:38,Come on.
98,00:07:40,00:07:40,Hold this.
99,00:08:01,00:08:02,Pulse is rising.
100,00:08:02,00:08:03,"David, string me a suture needle."
101,00:08:03,00:08:04,Go! Go!
102,00:08:53,00:08:55,Hey!
103,00:08:55,00:08:57,I think I may have something here!
104,00:09:01,00:09:02,Oh!
105,00:09:02,00:09:03,Whoa!
106,00:09:05,00:09:08,Got a leg.
107,00:09:08,00:09:09,STOKES: Obviously female.
108,00:09:09,00:09:12,Obviously.
109,00:09:12,00:09:14,Whew.
110,00:09:14,00:09:15,WILLOWS: Whoo!
111,00:09:15,00:09:16,STOKES: I'll bag it.
112,00:09:18,00:09:19,"All right. WILLOWS: Oh, yeah."
113,00:09:19,00:09:21,I got a torso and head.
114,00:09:21,00:09:22,Missing an eye.
115,00:09:22,00:09:24,(cawing)
116,00:09:24,00:09:28,"WILLOWS: Okay, so, uh how hot do you think it is, underneath all this trash?"
117,00:09:28,00:09:32,"STOKES: I don't know, what do you think-- ballpark at 120 degrees?"
118,00:09:32,00:09:34,So this is yesterday's trash.
119,00:09:34,00:09:35,Dead body.
120,00:09:35,00:09:36,Minimum 18 hours in this heat.
121,00:09:36,00:09:38,She should be totally bloated.
122,00:09:38,00:09:39,"Yeah, she's not."
123,00:09:39,00:09:41,"Yeah, she's really torn up."
124,00:09:44,00:09:46,Bulldozers are vicious.
125,00:09:48,00:09:51,"Yeah, I think they only finished the job."
126,00:09:51,00:09:52,How did she get here?
127,00:09:57,00:09:59,Heard you got to be superhero today.
128,00:09:59,00:10:03,I consider myself a superhero every day.
129,00:10:03,00:10:05,Got anything on Our Lady of the Dump?
130,00:10:05,00:10:07,COD is still indeterminate.
131,00:10:07,00:10:10,Blunt force trauma is a possibility.
132,00:10:10,00:10:13,She has some perimortem bruising around the left eye.
133,00:10:13,00:10:16,But limb removal is relatively clean.
134,00:10:16,00:10:17,Definitely postmortem.
135,00:10:17,00:10:20,"So we've got no arms, no prints."
136,00:10:20,00:10:23,What kind of identifying characteristics do we have?
137,00:10:23,00:10:24,Second degree midline episiotomy scar.
138,00:10:24,00:10:28,"Well, that narrows it down to more than half the women in this country who gave birth."
139,00:10:28,00:10:30,But there might be one other thing.
140,00:10:30,00:10:34,"At first I thought appendectomy, but check out her X ray."
141,00:10:34,00:10:35,She's had surgery.
142,00:10:36,00:10:39,Some kind of implant at the L4-L5 interspace.
143,00:10:39,00:10:41,I'll know more when I open her up.
144,00:10:42,00:10:44,"You're my hero, Al."
145,00:10:45,00:10:47,"All right, what do we know?"
146,00:10:47,00:10:50,That all of this trash was found around the victim.
147,00:10:50,00:10:54,And she was buried with some very expensive trash.
148,00:10:54,00:10:57,"Yeah, there's nothing wrong with this frying pan."
149,00:10:57,00:10:59,Could've gone to Goodwill or someplace.
150,00:10:59,00:11:01,Home pregnancy test.
151,00:11:01,00:11:03,Negative. Better luck next time.
152,00:11:03,00:11:07,Someone... does not like frozen peas.
153,00:11:07,00:11:09,They weren't shopping at Costco.
154,00:11:09,00:11:11,They paid way too much for ice cream.
155,00:11:11,00:11:15,There's a good chance our vic was wearing this shirt.
156,00:11:15,00:11:18,"Let's start trying to narrow this down to a neighborhood, huh?"
157,00:11:18,00:11:19,Excellent idea.
158,00:11:20,00:11:21,"Uh, marker or sort?"
159,00:11:22,00:11:22,Sort.
160,00:11:22,00:11:24,Please.
161,00:11:24,00:11:39,"First up: ""178 Spaulding Meadows."" Uh, ""174 Storm Cloud Lane."" A second 174 Storm Cloud Lane."
162,00:11:39,00:11:41,ROBBINS: Pulled it from the L4-L5 interspace.
163,00:11:41,00:11:48,Cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy with a titanium coating and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene component.
164,00:11:48,00:11:50,An artificial spinal disc.
165,00:11:50,00:11:54,If you can recreate a spine the possibilities are endless.
166,00:11:54,00:11:59,"I thought, uh, disc replacement surgery involved fusing bone to bone."
167,00:11:59,00:12:02,"Eh, typically, but it can limit mobility."
168,00:12:02,00:12:04,"With that little disc, your body doesn't know the difference."
169,00:12:05,00:12:10,"Matches range of motion, flexibility and an axial rotation of a normal spine."
170,00:12:10,00:12:12,Still in clinical trials.
171,00:12:12,00:12:16,Less than a thousand surgeries have been performed in this country.
172,00:12:16,00:12:18,"Oh, well, I like those odds."
173,00:12:18,00:12:20,You'll like this even better.
174,00:12:20,00:12:25,"Medium endplate, size 12, polyethylene component and a six-degree lordosis angle."
175,00:12:25,00:12:27,Narrowed it down to one.
176,00:12:27,00:12:28,Amy Ennis.
177,00:12:28,00:12:30,"Austin, Texas."
178,00:12:30,00:12:32,Tourist?
179,00:12:32,00:12:33,(chuckles)
180,00:12:33,00:12:36,That's for you to find out.
181,00:12:45,00:12:47,"Hey, is this all of them?"
182,00:12:47,00:12:50,"WILLOWS: Yeah, every last one on Storm Cloud Lane."
183,00:12:50,00:12:55,"SIDLE: Cans are on private property, it's not trash day, how did you get consent?"
184,00:12:55,00:12:57,I talked to the president of the owner's association.
185,00:12:57,00:12:58,What'd you threaten her with?
186,00:12:58,00:13:00,A return visit.
187,00:13:03,00:13:04,"Hey, guys?"
188,00:13:04,00:13:05,I got blood.
189,00:13:05,00:13:07,Yeah.
190,00:13:07,00:13:08,"Yeah me, too."
191,00:13:08,00:13:11,"WILLOWS: Well, that makes five."
192,00:13:11,00:13:13,Let's see if any of it's human.
193,00:13:34,00:13:36,These two are human.
194,00:13:43,00:13:48,If the vic was in here blood would have pooled to the bottom.
195,00:13:51,00:13:56,"Yeah, and blood dripped down the side of this one as the hydraulic arm dumped it."
196,00:13:56,00:13:58,(clanking)
197,00:14:00,00:14:01,This is our can.
198,00:14:03,00:14:05,And that's our house.
199,00:14:05,00:14:08,You found blood... inmytrash can?
200,00:14:08,00:14:10,Any idea how it got there?
201,00:14:10,00:14:13,No.
202,00:14:13,00:14:15,"Do you know an Amy Ennis from Austin, Texas?"
203,00:14:15,00:14:17,No.
204,00:14:17,00:14:20,"So, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about?"
205,00:14:22,00:14:25,Dad... you all right?
206,00:14:25,00:14:27,I'm fine.
207,00:14:27,00:14:28,What's going on?
208,00:14:28,00:14:30,I'm just asking your father a few questions.
209,00:14:30,00:14:31,Why don't you go inside and make some dinner?
210,00:14:32,00:14:33,What are you in the mood for?
211,00:14:33,00:14:35,Whatever you want.
212,00:14:38,00:14:39,"Charlie, homework."
213,00:14:39,00:14:41,Hey. Get the job?
214,00:14:41,00:14:43,Later.
215,00:14:43,00:14:44,Divorced?
216,00:14:44,00:14:45,Yeah.
217,00:14:46,00:14:47,Five years.
218,00:14:47,00:14:50,I hear David's resurrecting the dead now.
219,00:14:50,00:14:52,"(chuckles): Yeah, our little miracle worker."
220,00:14:52,00:14:54,I just came from the hospital.
221,00:14:54,00:14:56,That guy's in ICU with respiratory paralysis.
222,00:14:56,00:15:01,I did get a prelim on his blood work-- looks like some sort of an organic poison.
223,00:15:01,00:15:04,"Well, that would explain the discoloration Robbins found around his mouth."
224,00:15:04,00:15:06,"MAN: I'm telling you, this is great."
225,00:15:06,00:15:07,You're going to love this.
226,00:15:07,00:15:09,"30 miles to the gallon, very low maintenance."
227,00:15:09,00:15:11,Your people are going to love it.
228,00:15:11,00:15:14,You know what? I want you to tell them to throw away the manuals.
229,00:15:14,00:15:15,Call me for anything.
230,00:15:15,00:15:19,"Marty Gibson doesn't close a sale, he opens a relationship."
231,00:15:19,00:15:20,That guy's a charmer.
232,00:15:20,00:15:22,"Yeah, real Ricky Roma."
233,00:15:22,00:15:25,(dog yipping in distance)
234,00:15:29,00:15:30,"May I help you, gentlemen?"
235,00:15:30,00:15:31,"I'm Warrick Brown, this is Gil Grissom."
236,00:15:31,00:15:33,We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
237,00:15:33,00:15:34,Oh. Nanci Linden.
238,00:15:34,00:15:35,It's a pleasure to meet you.
239,00:15:35,00:15:38,We have a warrant to search your premises.
240,00:15:38,00:15:42,What for? For evidence concerning the attempted murder of Fred Stearns.
241,00:15:42,00:15:45,"Oh, he had a heart attack."
242,00:15:45,00:15:47,He's dead.
243,00:15:47,00:15:49,"No, he didn't..."
244,00:15:49,00:15:51,and he's not.
245,00:15:52,00:15:53,(dog barks)
246,00:15:53,00:15:54,"Gigi, shush."
247,00:15:54,00:15:55,Shh! (whimpers)
248,00:15:55,00:15:56,I'm sorry.
249,00:15:56,00:16:00,I'm not supposed to bring her in here.
250,00:16:00,00:16:02,(whispering)
251,00:16:06,00:16:08,"So, this was..."
252,00:16:08,00:16:09,isFred's desk.
253,00:16:09,00:16:12,Nobody's touched it since they took him away.
254,00:16:12,00:16:13,It's bad luck.
255,00:16:13,00:16:15,Middle desk is Marty Gibson.
256,00:16:15,00:16:17,The one on the end is Clyde Hinton.
257,00:16:17,00:16:19,Thank you.
258,00:16:23,00:16:27,Poison could've come from any of these sources here.
259,00:16:27,00:16:29,Oral fixation you think?
260,00:16:29,00:16:32,Constant need for gratification?
261,00:16:32,00:16:33,In every way.
262,00:16:33,00:16:35,This guy was like the monster closer.
263,00:16:37,00:16:39,"You ever buy a brand-new car, Griss?"
264,00:16:39,00:16:42,Depreciation doesn't make it a logical investment.
265,00:16:42,00:16:44,It's not about logic.
266,00:16:44,00:16:45,It's about thatsmell.
267,00:16:45,00:16:47,There's nothing like the smell of a brand-new car.
268,00:16:47,00:16:49,How right you are.
269,00:16:50,00:16:50,Marty Gibson.
270,00:16:52,00:16:54,"We're not buying, we're looking."
271,00:16:54,00:16:57,If we need any help we'll let you know.
272,00:16:57,00:17:01,"Sometimes it's not about what you need, sometimes it's about what youwant."
273,00:17:45,00:17:49,"GRISSOM: You always, uh, lock your drawers?"
274,00:17:51,00:17:52,Huh.
275,00:17:52,00:17:54,(snickers)
276,00:17:54,00:17:56,You're the one who super-glued Fred's phone.
277,00:17:56,00:18:03,"(chuckles) ""Chewing Gum: will turn any mouth black for days."" (laughs) (cell phone rings)"
278,00:18:03,00:18:04,Warrick Brown.
279,00:18:04,00:18:07,I get it. You're the funny guy.
280,00:18:07,00:18:09,"You know the definition of ""kismet,"" Mr. Grissom?"
281,00:18:09,00:18:13,"Do you know the definition of attempted murder, Mr. Hinton?"
282,00:18:13,00:18:14,Just go with me for a second.
283,00:18:14,00:18:16,Go with you where?
284,00:18:16,00:18:24,"Come on... ""kismet."" Fate, or destiny from the Arabic word meaning to distribute, or divide up."
285,00:18:24,00:18:26,Smart guy.
286,00:18:26,00:18:28,Destiny is what you make of it.
287,00:18:28,00:18:33,It's what gets distributed to me while the other guy's washing the stain off his lips.
288,00:18:33,00:18:35,"Well, boys, just closed another fatty."
289,00:18:35,00:18:38,Two hours of schmooze-- I can't lose.
290,00:18:38,00:18:39,Your lips.
291,00:18:40,00:18:41,Clyde!
292,00:18:41,00:18:42,"Don't worry, Freddy."
293,00:18:42,00:18:44,I'll handle the client.
294,00:18:44,00:18:45,(laughs)
295,00:18:45,00:18:49,"Look, everyone tries to get an edge in this business."
296,00:18:49,00:18:51,I use jokes.
297,00:18:51,00:18:53,Fred Stearns just passed away.
298,00:18:53,00:18:55,Again.
299,00:18:59,00:19:02,Dead guy. Not funny.
300,00:19:06,00:19:08,"Okay, David, take two."
301,00:19:13,00:19:15,No luck on Amy Ennis's next of kin.
302,00:19:15,00:19:17,The Austin PD is still working on it.
303,00:19:17,00:19:18,"Well, we know that she had a kid."
304,00:19:18,00:19:19,"Well, she gave birth."
305,00:19:19,00:19:21,That doesn't mean that she had a kid.
306,00:19:21,00:19:23,"So, what, we've got nothing?"
307,00:19:23,00:19:28,"We have a Mercury Sable, uh, Texas plates, found in the lot of the Tangiers hotel."
308,00:19:28,00:19:29,She's the registered owner.
309,00:19:29,00:19:30,They're bringing it in now.
310,00:19:45,00:19:50,If the poison was administered orally I may know how it got into the bloodstream.
311,00:19:51,00:19:54,Gastric ulcer.
312,00:19:54,00:20:02,"In a healthy, functioning stomach mucosa lines the walls and prevents the hydrochloric acid from burning the organ itself."
313,00:20:02,00:20:08,"But ifh. pylorigets in there, sends the whole system off-balance, stops the mucosa, and causes an ulcer."
314,00:20:08,00:20:13,Opens a direct channel from your digestive tract straight into your bloodstream.
315,00:20:14,00:20:16,I know a lot about stress-related ailments.
316,00:20:16,00:20:19,ROBBINS: Any word yet on a poison?
317,00:20:19,00:20:22,Tox screen ruled out the ink gum.
318,00:20:22,00:20:24,"It could've been a factor, though."
319,00:20:24,00:20:27,"Uh, gum churns up stomach acid-- instant inflammation."
320,00:20:27,00:20:29,"I don't care about his indigestion, Doc."
321,00:20:29,00:20:30,We need to know what killed him.
322,00:20:30,00:20:33,"Well, she wasn't in town on business."
323,00:20:33,00:20:34,What's that?
324,00:20:35,00:20:36,(clicking tongue)
325,00:20:36,00:20:37,Oh!
326,00:20:37,00:20:39,"Depends on what her business was, I guess."
327,00:20:39,00:20:41,(chuckles)
328,00:20:43,00:20:47,Nothing risquÃ© about the rest of her wardrobe.
329,00:20:47,00:20:49,"Maybe she got it here. She could've met somebody, you know."
330,00:20:52,00:20:54,"STOKES: Okay, I'm going to fume."
331,00:21:15,00:21:17,(beeping)
332,00:21:18,00:21:20,(two beeps)
333,00:21:20,00:21:21,(tapping key)
334,00:21:21,00:21:25,"According to Greg, the hairs and the DNA from the toothbrush are a match to the vic."
335,00:21:25,00:21:27,What about the prints from her car?
336,00:21:27,00:21:28,"I thought I messed it up, so I ran it twice."
337,00:21:28,00:21:32,"No errant prints, all a match to the same woman."
338,00:21:32,00:21:33,Amy Ennis.
339,00:21:33,00:21:35,"No ""Amy Ennis"" in the database."
340,00:21:35,00:21:37,"Well, Amy Ennis is our vic. It's her car."
341,00:21:37,00:21:39,Prints came back to somebody named Kelly Easton.
342,00:21:39,00:21:41,WILLOWS: Kelly Easton...
343,00:21:41,00:21:43,Easton...
344,00:21:43,00:21:44,174 Storm Cloud Lane?
345,00:21:44,00:21:47,What's the first thing you do when you don't want to be found?
346,00:21:47,00:21:49,Leave town. Yeah...
347,00:21:49,00:21:51,and change your name.
348,00:21:52,00:21:54,WILLOWS: ...want to Mulligan on your first story?
349,00:21:55,00:21:56,"""Divorced""?"
350,00:21:56,00:21:58,EASTON: What the hell was I supposed to say?
351,00:21:58,00:22:02,My wife went out to get her hair done and never came home.
352,00:22:02,00:22:06,"Well, maybe you gave her a reason to leave."
353,00:22:06,00:22:07,"Spousal abuse, cheating..."
354,00:22:08,00:22:09,"Aw, you people."
355,00:22:09,00:22:17,"You know, you were here five years ago with your grid searches, your dogs, your cadets-- you came up empty."
356,00:22:17,00:22:24,"You give me a good reason why my wife left me, I'd love to hear it, because I tried the truth."
357,00:22:24,00:22:25,I didn't know what happened.
358,00:22:25,00:22:28,You know what I got for it?
359,00:22:28,00:22:31,They all think I killed my wife.
360,00:22:31,00:22:34,Her parents sued me for custody.
361,00:22:34,00:22:36,"I lost my job, my friends."
362,00:22:36,00:22:40,Only thing I got left are those kids and this house.
363,00:22:40,00:22:42,"Okay, you didn't kill her."
364,00:22:42,00:22:44,At least back then.
365,00:23:28,00:23:31,I don't think these belong to Dad.
366,00:23:33,00:23:35,Could place Mrs. Easton at the house.
367,00:23:35,00:23:37,She came back about a month ago.
368,00:23:37,00:23:39,Doorbell rings...
369,00:23:42,00:23:43,"Huh, what do you say?"
370,00:23:44,00:23:45,Hi.
371,00:23:46,00:23:47,(chuckling)
372,00:23:47,00:23:49,SIDLE: You tell me.
373,00:23:49,00:23:51,"Whatever it is, it must've worked."
374,00:23:51,00:23:53,She was back in your bedroom.
375,00:23:53,00:23:56,"Well, they say time heals all wounds."
376,00:23:56,00:23:58,It's crap.
377,00:23:58,00:24:04,"I hate her for what she did to us, but I swear, it was the first time I felt anything in five years."
378,00:25:09,00:25:11,"CHARLIE: So, she's really dead?"
379,00:25:12,00:25:13,Yeah.
380,00:25:14,00:25:15,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
381,00:25:15,00:25:17,Figures.
382,00:25:17,00:25:17,How's that?
383,00:25:17,00:25:19,She left without telling us.
384,00:25:20,00:25:21,Figures she'd die the same way.
385,00:25:22,00:25:25,"I don't think your mom knew she was going to die, bud."
386,00:25:25,00:25:27,Whatever.
387,00:25:27,00:25:30,(muffled music playing)
388,00:25:30,00:25:34,"Last time I saw my mother, I was... in seventh grade."
389,00:25:34,00:25:39,"She handed me my lunch and said, ""See you after school."" Did you know that she was back?"
390,00:25:39,00:25:42,I thought that she was dead.
391,00:25:44,00:25:46,Can I sit down?
392,00:25:46,00:25:48,"Yeah, sure."
393,00:25:48,00:25:50,"Nora, I'm sorry."
394,00:25:50,00:25:55,I know this has got to be very hard on you and your brother.
395,00:25:56,00:25:58,And my dad.
396,00:26:04,00:26:06,Is your dad seeing anybody?
397,00:26:06,00:26:09,Does he have a girlfriend?
398,00:26:09,00:26:11,How could he?
399,00:27:45,00:27:50,"STOKES: This is where I found the hairs, in between the packages of frozen peas."
400,00:27:52,00:27:54,Mrs. Easton was a brunette.
401,00:27:54,00:27:58,And we found a warehouse worth of frozen peas at the landfill.
402,00:28:00,00:28:02,"Lack of swelling, clean fractures..."
403,00:28:06,00:28:07,She was frozen.
404,00:28:12,00:28:14,Skin and muscle would've lost elasticity.
405,00:28:14,00:28:17,Fracture planes would've passed through in a straight line.
406,00:28:17,00:28:21,"I'm thinking somebody in this family stuck her in here, waited 'til trash day."
407,00:28:26,00:28:29,"Well, the garbage tells us how she was killed."
408,00:28:29,00:28:31,Now I want to know who.
409,00:28:37,00:28:41,That unknown substance I collected from Marty Gibson's coat...
410,00:28:41,00:28:43,Possibly reptilian skin?
411,00:28:43,00:28:44,How'd you know?
412,00:28:44,00:28:45,Tox report.
413,00:28:46,00:28:49,The organic poison came back snake venom.
414,00:28:49,00:28:55,I think maybe it's time to open a relationship with Marty Gibson.
415,00:28:55,00:28:58,We found reptile skin on your jacket sleeve.
416,00:28:58,00:29:02,"So, unless you're shedding, we want to know how it got there."
417,00:29:02,00:29:03,"Whoa, gentlemen, slow down."
418,00:29:03,00:29:05,Can I get you a cup of coffee?
419,00:29:05,00:29:06,"Nanci...? No, thank you."
420,00:29:06,00:29:08,Doughnut? Everybody loves doughnuts. Nanci.
421,00:29:08,00:29:10,No doughnuts.
422,00:29:10,00:29:13,"Fred Stearns dropped a dime at Girls, Girls, Girls and wrote it off."
423,00:29:13,00:29:14,Kaido Computers.
424,00:29:14,00:29:16,"Software guys are nuts, into the kinky stuff."
425,00:29:16,00:29:19,"End of the day, they're driving Fred's cars."
426,00:29:19,00:29:21,"Neiman Marcus, jewelry department?"
427,00:29:21,00:29:23,Fred knew you got to spend money to make money.
428,00:29:24,00:29:25,"Well, here's a freaky one."
429,00:29:25,00:29:27,Since when are two dozen mice a business expense?
430,00:29:27,00:29:30,Since I got The Pet Place to buy a mini-van from me.
431,00:29:30,00:29:31,My cousin works there.
432,00:29:31,00:29:32,You got kids?
433,00:29:32,00:29:35,I could put you in a wagon way below sticker.
434,00:29:35,00:29:39,"Marty, what'd you do with the mice?"
435,00:29:39,00:29:41,What do you care?
436,00:29:41,00:29:44,You going to arrest me for blurring the lines?
437,00:29:44,00:29:45,No.
438,00:29:45,00:29:47,We were leaning towards murder.
439,00:29:52,00:29:55,You guys are completely overreacting.
440,00:29:55,00:29:57,It's just a hobby.
441,00:29:57,00:29:59,See?
442,00:29:59,00:30:01,Fuzzies. They're food.
443,00:30:01,00:30:04,You know it's illegal in the State of Nevada to have venomous snakes?
444,00:30:05,00:30:07,"If you handle them correctly, snakes are harmless."
445,00:30:07,00:30:08,I know what I'm doing.
446,00:30:08,00:30:10,"Yeah, that's what we're afraid of."
447,00:30:10,00:30:13,DANIEL: I didn't even know she was dead.
448,00:30:13,00:30:15,Thought she'd just left me again.
449,00:30:15,00:30:18,"BRASS: Well, it's a good thing you didn't tell the kids mom was back."
450,00:30:18,00:30:21,"My client agreed to talk to you, not be harassed by you."
451,00:30:21,00:30:22,You're right.
452,00:30:22,00:30:24,"Well, you were excited to see her."
453,00:30:24,00:30:25,Why wouldn't the kids be?
454,00:30:25,00:30:26,I'm an adult.
455,00:30:26,00:30:30,"That's right, you're an adult-- knowledgeable, experienced..."
456,00:30:30,00:30:36,"aware of Nevada Statutes, Chapter 156: Administration of Estates of Missing Persons."
457,00:30:36,00:30:37,It's a matter of public record.
458,00:30:38,00:30:40,We've been filling out those forms for five years.
459,00:30:40,00:30:41,You're jumping the gun.
460,00:30:41,00:30:43,"It's four years, 11 months, one week."
461,00:30:43,00:30:45,So what?
462,00:30:45,00:30:48,"Well, in three weeks, Mrs. Easton's estate can be distributed to her husband."
463,00:30:48,00:30:51,You had a half a million dollar life insurance policy on your wife.
464,00:30:51,00:30:52,And she had one on me.
465,00:30:52,00:30:53,We did that for the kids.
466,00:30:54,00:30:57,"But you're not dead, and she wasn't either, two days ago."
467,00:30:57,00:31:01,"You know, for an unemployed guy you're doing a lot of spending."
468,00:31:01,00:31:05,"I mean, Tiffany's, La Perla International Watch Company..."
469,00:31:05,00:31:07,Expecting a windfall?
470,00:31:07,00:31:08,Don't answer that.
471,00:31:09,00:31:11,You're fishing.
472,00:31:11,00:31:12,"No, I do that with a pole."
473,00:31:12,00:31:14,"No, I'm just thinking out loud."
474,00:31:14,00:31:15,Your wife disappears.
475,00:31:15,00:31:19,"Five years after the fact, you get the money."
476,00:31:19,00:31:21,"You've earned it, it's yours, but she screwed you up."
477,00:31:21,00:31:23,She showed up.
478,00:31:25,00:31:28,I did not kill my wife.
479,00:31:28,00:31:29,"What happened, Daniel?"
480,00:31:30,00:31:33,"The sex wasn't as good as you remembered it, or the money was better?"
481,00:31:34,00:31:35,What happened?
482,00:31:39,00:31:43,Scales found on your suspect's jacket are keeled.
483,00:31:43,00:31:46,Diamondback Rattlesnake.
484,00:31:46,00:31:49,"His others, smooth scales."
485,00:31:49,00:31:54,A snake fang is basically a hypodermic needle.
486,00:31:54,00:31:56,Oral glands hold in the venom...
487,00:31:57,00:31:58,like the barrel.
488,00:31:58,00:32:05,"When aggravated, the jaw muscles push on the toxin, like a plunger."
489,00:32:05,00:32:08,"Only, our victim didn't have any puncture wounds."
490,00:32:11,00:32:20,"Well, your guy's probably pretty comfortable with his collection-- otherwise, he'd be dead-- which means, he could've milked this one."
491,00:32:20,00:32:22,And brought the venom with him to the dealership.
492,00:32:23,00:32:26,"Well, the trace lab found venom proteins in his coffee cup."
493,00:32:26,00:32:28,Could that have killed him?
494,00:32:28,00:32:34,"Well, I know a lot of hot shots who drink the stuff-- manly, daredevil B.S.-- and they're still alive."
495,00:32:34,00:32:41,"Because typically, the stomach acids would kill the venom before it reached the bloodstream, but if you had an ulcer..."
496,00:32:41,00:32:44,"Hmm, then you're seriously screwed."
497,00:32:44,00:32:47,Was there an abnormal tissue death? Necrosis?
498,00:32:48,00:32:49,No.
499,00:32:49,00:32:50,That rules out his Diamondback Rattlesnake.
500,00:32:51,00:32:53,Rattler venom's hemotoxic.
501,00:32:53,00:32:57,It means it predigests the tissue before swallowing.
502,00:32:58,00:33:02,"Well, the ELISA test came back positive for alpha-neurotoxins."
503,00:33:02,00:33:06,"Well, your guy likes them mean."
504,00:33:06,00:33:09,"These other two could've done the job, both neurotoxic."
505,00:33:09,00:33:12,"Which would send the body into complete and total paralysis, right?"
506,00:33:12,00:33:17,Explaining why the victim ended up in the morgue the first time.
507,00:33:17,00:33:21,"Okay, blood from the bedroom chair and the kitchen belong to Mom."
508,00:33:21,00:33:22,That's what I figured.
509,00:33:22,00:33:27,"Hair from the freezer-- nicely preserved, by the way-- and hairs from the bedroom pillow, also the victim's."
510,00:33:27,00:33:33,"Okay, this is all great, but, uh, why the 9-1-1 page?"
511,00:33:33,00:33:36,The moral of my story-- share and share alleles.
512,00:33:36,00:33:40,"Pubic hairs in the bed, not Mom's."
513,00:33:41,00:33:45,The daughter.
514,00:33:45,00:33:48,Dad did have a new girlfriend.
515,00:33:51,00:33:53,The bracelet was a gift.
516,00:33:53,00:33:56,From your father.
517,00:33:56,00:34:01,"Diamonds and platinum, that's, uh, pretty fancy."
518,00:34:01,00:34:03,Guess he thought I deserved it.
519,00:34:03,00:34:06,Why?
520,00:34:06,00:34:09,For taking care of everything.
521,00:34:11,00:34:12,Everything?
522,00:34:12,00:34:19,"Laundry, groceries, carpool for Charlie..."
523,00:34:19,00:34:21,Is that it?
524,00:34:27,00:34:28,Nora...
525,00:34:29,00:34:35,"I'd really like to help you and your brother, but I can't unless you talk to me."
526,00:34:41,00:34:45,We found evidence of you in your father's bed.
527,00:34:51,00:34:53,My father loves me.
528,00:35:01,00:35:04,"Oh, my God."
529,00:35:07,00:35:09,Are you lactating?
530,00:35:12,00:35:14,You're pregnant.
531,00:35:23,00:35:26,You sick son of a bitch.
532,00:35:26,00:35:29,Did you think we weren't going to find out she was pregnant?
533,00:35:29,00:35:31,Who?
534,00:35:31,00:35:32,"Oh, stop it. Your daughter."
535,00:35:32,00:35:34,Nora is pregnant?
536,00:35:34,00:35:36,Cut the clueless routine.
537,00:35:36,00:35:37,What are you accusing me of?
538,00:35:40,00:35:41,Daniel!
539,00:35:43,00:35:46,Your wife came back and saw what you were doing.
540,00:35:46,00:35:51,"So, you killed her, and you tried to buy off your daughter with a diamond bracelet."
541,00:35:51,00:35:53,I bought that for my wife.
542,00:35:53,00:35:55,Your daughter's telling a different story.
543,00:35:55,00:35:57,Nora? How could she even know about...
544,00:35:57,00:35:59,I'm going to nail you for murder.
545,00:36:03,00:36:05,"What do you mean, ""None""?"
546,00:36:05,00:36:09,"Well, venom's like perfume-- highly specific recipe."
547,00:36:09,00:36:12,"Protein ratios vary from species to species, even snake to snake."
548,00:36:12,00:36:17,"The protein level of your three ""hoses"" doesn't match the sample taken from the vic's coffee cup."
549,00:36:17,00:36:19,"So, Marty was telling the truth?"
550,00:36:19,00:36:23,"It was just a coincidence that he owns poisonous snakes, and his co-worker was envenomated."
551,00:36:23,00:36:26,A coincidence is a scientific anomaly.
552,00:36:27,00:36:29,Maybe he just got rid of the snake.
553,00:36:36,00:36:38,Girl called all hysterical.
554,00:36:38,00:36:40,Said a snake ate her dog.
555,00:36:40,00:36:42,It's a monacled cobra-- it's not indigenous.
556,00:36:42,00:36:43,Comes from southeast Asia.
557,00:36:44,00:36:45,I asked her where she got it from.
558,00:36:45,00:36:48,She said her co-worker asked her to snake-sit.
559,00:36:48,00:36:50,Marty Gibson.
560,00:36:50,00:36:52,Mm-hmm.
561,00:36:55,00:36:58,You're that guy from the crime lab.
562,00:36:59,00:37:00,"Well, you're a little late."
563,00:37:00,00:37:10,"Bastard told me he had a sure-fire way to win the Cabo trip, and that he'd take me with him if I just watched his snake for a couple of days."
564,00:37:10,00:37:14,I can't believe what an idiot I am.
565,00:37:14,00:37:17,Never trust a car salesman.
566,00:37:17,00:37:19,What else did you do for Marty?
567,00:37:23,00:37:25,"Well, notthat."
568,00:37:25,00:37:27,Did you get him coffee?
569,00:37:27,00:37:30,"Oh, well, now I do."
570,00:37:30,00:37:31,Nowyou do?
571,00:37:31,00:37:40,"Yeah. It used to be Marty, the goodwill guy who got coffee for everybody else, but now, since Fred's dead, he's moved up a desk."
572,00:37:40,00:37:42,"""The goodwill guy?"" Yeah."
573,00:37:42,00:37:47,"The guy with no client list of his own, has to live off the hand-me-downs of the others."
574,00:37:47,00:37:50,"FRED: Hey, Marty, uh, sure could use another refill."
575,00:37:50,00:37:51,You want anything?
576,00:37:51,00:37:52,Easy on the sugar.
577,00:37:52,00:37:53,Coming right up.
578,00:37:55,00:37:58,"Well, sometimes access is all you need."
579,00:38:07,00:38:09,Nanci.
580,00:38:09,00:38:11,"Do you know what a syllogism is, Mr. Gibson?"
581,00:38:11,00:38:13,Sylla-what?
582,00:38:13,00:38:14,A syllogism.
583,00:38:14,00:38:15,Aristotelian logic.
584,00:38:15,00:38:17,Two premises equal one conclusion.
585,00:38:17,00:38:19,"BOTH: ""A"" plus ""B"" equals ""C."" Right."
586,00:38:19,00:38:20,"So, you're the snake guy."
587,00:38:20,00:38:22,You're also the goodwill guy who gets the coffee.
588,00:38:22,00:38:26,"So, when someone is poisoned with snake venom in their coffee, ""A"" plus ""B"" equals you."
589,00:38:26,00:38:30,"I busted my ass out on this floor to get a desk up there, and for what?"
590,00:38:30,00:38:31,So Fred can make me his bitch?
591,00:38:31,00:38:32,So you kill him?
592,00:38:32,00:38:33,Fred killed himself.
593,00:38:33,00:38:34,Guy was like a goldfish.
594,00:38:34,00:38:37,He would have eaten himself to death before he tossed me a client.
595,00:38:37,00:38:39,And one good client breeds seven more.
596,00:38:39,00:38:41,"Without the one, I keep slipping."
597,00:38:41,00:38:43,There's two directions in this business-- up and out.
598,00:38:43,00:38:44,It's a numbers game.
599,00:38:44,00:38:46,I'm 35 years old.
600,00:38:46,00:38:47,I got six guys ready to move me out.
601,00:38:47,00:38:49,"Opportunity knocks, you open the door."
602,00:38:49,00:38:51,I guess it's just too bad he had an ulcer.
603,00:38:54,00:38:55,Who doesn't?
604,00:38:59,00:39:03,"Okay, if I can just have you lay back."
605,00:39:03,00:39:06,"All right, Nora, I'm going to need you to relax."
606,00:39:09,00:39:12,"Okay, now take a deep breath."
607,00:39:14,00:39:16,Good.
608,00:39:16,00:39:20,"All right, another deep breath."
609,00:39:23,00:39:25,(no audio)
610,00:39:28,00:39:29,She's a virgin?
611,00:39:29,00:39:32,"What are we talking about, an immaculate conception?"
612,00:39:32,00:39:35,More like the immaculateperception.
613,00:39:35,00:39:38,Pseudocyesis-- imagined pregnancy.
614,00:39:38,00:39:41,It's all in her head?
615,00:39:41,00:39:47,"Well, that would explain what she was doing in Dad's bed."
616,00:39:47,00:39:49,Fantasizing.
617,00:39:49,00:39:51,Wow.
618,00:39:51,00:40:00,"""When the desire to become pregnant is so strong ""hormone levels can change, setting off all the biological signs of pregnancy."" It kind of makes sense."
619,00:40:00,00:40:03,Hormones travel the same channels as adrenaline.
620,00:40:03,00:40:13,"""Swollen abdomen, ""lack of menstruation, and sometimes bilateral galactorrhea."" Milk production in both breasts."
621,00:40:13,00:40:16,Leaking can be brought on by stress.
622,00:40:17,00:40:28,"""Emotional or physical stimuli ""cause prolactin to shoot through the endocrine system, ""ending in the mammary glands, and triggering the cells to lactate."" The father was clueless."
623,00:40:28,00:40:30,About all the women in his life.
624,00:40:30,00:40:32,"STOKES: Hey, hey."
625,00:40:32,00:40:34,Check out these photos.
626,00:40:34,00:40:41,"The two stains on the inside of the shirt we found at the dump tested positive for Nora, but the stains on the outside, bloodstains, are definitely Mom's."
627,00:40:41,00:40:43,WILLOWS: The bracelet was Mom's.
628,00:40:43,00:40:45,Greg checked the epithelials.
629,00:40:45,00:40:49,"Nora's in love with her father, in an Electra kind of way."
630,00:40:52,00:40:54,"WILLOWS: Nora, is this your shirt?"
631,00:40:54,00:40:56,Yes.
632,00:40:58,00:41:01,Can you explain to me how your mother's blood ended up on it?
633,00:41:05,00:41:07,No idea how it got there?
634,00:41:09,00:41:11,No.
635,00:41:14,00:41:18,"WILLOWS: Well, you told me that this bracelet was a gift from your father."
636,00:41:18,00:41:21,He claims that he bought it for your mother.
637,00:41:21,00:41:22,"Oh, no."
638,00:41:22,00:41:25,It's mine.
639,00:41:25,00:41:28,I think you feel the same way about your father.
640,00:41:57,00:41:59,Guess who's back?
641,00:42:12,00:42:17,And then you put your mother in the freezer and you waited until trash day.
642,00:42:20,00:42:22,That's a horrible story.
643,00:42:23,00:42:24,It's not a story.
644,00:42:24,00:42:27,It's what the evidence tells us really happened.
645,00:42:27,00:42:31,What kind of a mother would do that?
646,00:42:31,00:42:33,I'm helpful.
647,00:42:33,00:42:35,I do what needs to be done.
648,00:42:35,00:42:37,I know. You take care of things.
649,00:42:37,00:42:40,I never ask for anything!
650,00:42:40,00:42:43,And all you wanted was the one thing that you couldn't have.
651,00:42:43,00:42:45,It's not my fault.
652,00:42:45,00:42:46,I'm innocent.
653,00:42:48,00:42:50,"You were innocent, Nora."
654,00:42:50,00:42:52,You're not anymore.
655,00:42:57,00:42:58,What are you doing?
656,00:42:59,00:43:02,BRASS: You're under arrest for the murder of Kelly Easton.
657,00:43:02,00:43:04,"No, but I'm going to have a baby!"
658,00:43:05,00:43:07,(sighing)
659,00:43:07,00:43:09,"Well, she's going to retain an attorney."
660,00:43:10,00:43:12,He's going to advise her to plead insanity.
661,00:43:12,00:43:14,Good defense.
662,00:43:15,00:43:17,Yeah.
663,00:43:18,00:43:20,Have you ever seen anything like this before?
664,00:43:21,00:43:24,How it manifested? No.
665,00:43:24,00:43:28,But the cause?
666,00:43:28,00:43:31,People throw things away every day.
