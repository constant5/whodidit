1,00:00:25,00:00:26,"Hey, Danny."
2,00:00:31,00:00:32,Thanks.
3,00:00:43,00:00:44,(beeping)
4,00:00:44,00:00:46,(door bolt clanks)
5,00:00:51,00:00:53,(beeping)
6,00:00:53,00:00:54,(door bolt clanks)
7,00:01:06,00:01:09,(announcements over P.A.)
8,00:01:14,00:01:15,"Some night, huh?"
9,00:01:16,00:01:17,It's ugly out there.
10,00:01:47,00:01:49,(thunder rumbling)
11,00:02:00,00:02:01,(man grunting)
12,00:02:04,00:02:06,(device beeping)
13,00:02:08,00:02:15,"We have two types of patients here: the criminally insane and sexually violent predators, all with multiple convictions."
14,00:02:15,00:02:18,We get all the inmates the prisons can't handle.
15,00:02:18,00:02:22,Keep your kits closed and locked when not in use.
16,00:02:22,00:02:23,"Um, Ms. Sidle, best if you remove the vest."
17,00:02:23,00:02:27,New uniforms upset them.
18,00:02:32,00:02:38,We're mostly concerned with maintaining psychiatric remission.
19,00:02:38,00:02:45,We want to stabilize symptoms and reduce an individual's risk of violence to himself and to others.
20,00:02:45,00:02:50,"Oh, uh, could actually stop here and put your backs against the wall, please."
21,00:02:50,00:02:52,It's standard safety procedure.
22,00:02:59,00:03:01,(exhaling heavily)
23,00:03:01,00:03:04,"MAN: Put your tongue in your mouth, Jake."
24,00:03:04,00:03:05,We're moving them all to the Day Room.
25,00:03:12,00:03:13,This is Captain Brass.
26,00:03:14,00:03:18,Dr. Grissom and Ms. Sidle are from the Crime Lab.
27,00:03:18,00:03:19,"Lt. Reed Owens, Desert State Hospital Police."
28,00:03:19,00:03:25,We have our own internal police team and Lieutenant Owens was the first officer on the scene after the call came in.
29,00:03:25,00:03:28,The victim was found by Nurse Faber at approximately 12:10 a.m.
30,00:03:28,00:03:31,"Joanne was coming off shift, I was coming on."
31,00:03:31,00:03:34,"Doing bed checks, I found Robbie on the floor."
32,00:03:34,00:03:37,Kenny was in the corner covered in blood.
33,00:03:37,00:03:39,Are the patients locked in their rooms at night?
34,00:03:39,00:03:41,No. The doors are left unlocked.
35,00:03:41,00:03:44,BRASS: So they're free to roam around?
36,00:03:44,00:03:48,Locked rooms usually lead to patients trying to harm themselves.
37,00:03:48,00:03:49,BRASS: Where's Kenny now?
38,00:03:49,00:03:51,He's been taken to seclusion.
39,00:03:51,00:03:52,(screaming)
40,00:03:55,00:03:58,Shh-shh-shh.
41,00:03:58,00:04:02,"Leon, let's get a couple more milligrams of Lorazepam into him."
42,00:04:04,00:04:06,How did he get those wounds?
43,00:04:06,00:04:07,"Oh, Kenny's a self-mutilator."
44,00:04:07,00:04:10,He suffers from Renfield's Syndrome; gets off on blood.
45,00:04:10,00:04:11,Shh...
46,00:04:11,00:04:17,Couple of weeks ago I caught him gouging himself with a carpet staple.
47,00:04:17,00:04:20,He was wearing these clothes when you found him?
48,00:04:20,00:04:21,Yes.
49,00:04:27,00:04:30,There was blood spatter all over the victim's room.
50,00:04:31,00:04:33,Blood but no spatter on Kenny's clothes.
51,00:04:33,00:04:35,I'm not sure this is our guy.
52,00:04:35,00:04:38,Locked unit. Finite number of suspects.
53,00:04:41,00:04:45,Crazy or not... here we come.
54,00:05:31,00:05:34,Who's this guy knitting an imaginary sweater?
55,00:05:34,00:05:36,How's he know when it's finished?
56,00:05:36,00:05:38,His brain tells him that what he's doing is real.
57,00:05:38,00:05:40,He has no reason to doubt it.
58,00:05:40,00:05:42,Or any desire to.
59,00:05:42,00:05:46,GRISSOM: They asked John Nash how he could believe that extraterrestrials were sending him messages.
60,00:05:46,00:05:52,He said that the messages came to him in the same way that his mathematical ideas did.
61,00:05:52,00:05:54,So he had to take them seriously.
62,00:05:54,00:05:56,Hey. Valerie Dino.
63,00:05:56,00:05:57,I'm the on-call doctor.
64,00:05:58,00:05:59,Did you pronounce?
65,00:05:59,00:06:00,Yeah.
66,00:06:00,00:06:05,"The administration asked me to set up some rooms for your interviews, but, uh, personally, I don't see what you hope to accomplish."
67,00:06:05,00:06:08,These patients are criminals with severe mental disorders.
68,00:06:08,00:06:10,They're not going to give you a straight answer.
69,00:06:11,00:06:12,No one ever does.
70,00:06:26,00:06:28,(thunder rumbling)
71,00:06:43,00:06:45,(thunder rumbling)
72,00:07:13,00:07:15,I definitely heard something.
73,00:07:15,00:07:23,"He said, ""I'll get in!"" No, no, it was, ""I'm coming in."" I heard him say it."
74,00:07:23,00:07:24,And it's not like he isn't serious.
75,00:07:28,00:07:30,Who isn't serious?
76,00:07:30,00:07:32,"The, uh, perpetrator."
77,00:07:35,00:07:38,Can you tell me anything else about him?
78,00:07:38,00:07:40,"Oh, no, I couldn't."
79,00:07:40,00:07:42,Why not?
80,00:07:42,00:07:44,(whispers): He's here.
81,00:07:47,00:07:48,In this room?
82,00:07:50,00:07:53,Is his name Ronald?
83,00:07:53,00:07:55,No. My name is Ronald.
84,00:07:56,00:07:57,What's his name?
85,00:07:57,00:07:59,He doesn't have a name.
86,00:07:59,00:08:01,He's a cricket.
87,00:08:01,00:08:03,Here.
88,00:08:03,00:08:04,A cricket?
89,00:08:05,00:08:06,Yes.
90,00:08:06,00:08:09,Trying to burrow a hole in my head.
91,00:08:15,00:08:16,I don't sleep.
92,00:08:18,00:08:20,Never?
93,00:08:23,00:08:25,So what do you do at night?
94,00:08:25,00:08:28,"Day, night, it don't make no difference."
95,00:08:28,00:08:29,I think.
96,00:08:32,00:08:33,About what?
97,00:08:35,00:08:36,Bitches.
98,00:09:18,00:09:20,What's so amusing?
99,00:09:20,00:09:25,"So let's say you find out who did it, and maybe it's me."
100,00:09:27,00:09:30,What are you going to do?
101,00:09:30,00:09:33,Are you going to convict me of murder and put me in a bad place?
102,00:09:33,00:09:36,Is it you?
103,00:09:36,00:09:37,"Check the files, sir."
104,00:09:37,00:09:40,"I'm a rapist, not a murderer."
105,00:09:40,00:09:41,(thunder crashing)
106,00:09:44,00:09:47,Robert Garson?
107,00:09:48,00:09:49,Hmm?
108,00:09:54,00:09:57,GRISSOM: Do you know what happened to Robert Garson?
109,00:09:57,00:10:05,"Female pig relation hanged, it sped even, well, too."
110,00:10:06,00:10:07,What?
111,00:10:09,00:10:16,No. I ground it... blindly.
112,00:10:16,00:10:17,Wet and dirty.
113,00:10:17,00:10:19,Cut the blood oven.
114,00:10:19,00:10:23,"It spoke justly, repeatedly, calmly."
115,00:10:23,00:10:26,Some thin rod dared your wash.
116,00:10:26,00:10:32,"They foretold this into some ready child, which fell crossly."
117,00:10:32,00:10:36,They hag-rode me... again.
118,00:10:38,00:10:40,Why are you looking at me?
119,00:10:40,00:10:42,"You got Leon, he's a spic."
120,00:10:42,00:10:44,"Earl, the brother."
121,00:10:44,00:10:48,And the crazy frickin' jewboy with the bug in his head.
122,00:10:52,00:10:55,"You know, most of the doctors here are Jewish."
123,00:10:55,00:10:57,They're the ones with the access.
124,00:11:03,00:11:04,Yeah?
125,00:11:05,00:11:07,Dr. Dino.
126,00:11:07,00:11:08,Hi.
127,00:11:08,00:11:11,Paperwork.
128,00:11:11,00:11:13,This is a state-run facility.
129,00:11:13,00:11:14,What can I help you with?
130,00:11:14,00:11:17,Question about the victim.
131,00:11:17,00:11:24,"I have heard that in some cases of deviant sexual predisposition, you slow the sex drive..."
132,00:11:24,00:11:28,"If you're talking about chemical castration, the answer is, yes, Robbie was."
133,00:11:28,00:11:31,So he didn't masturbate.
134,00:11:31,00:11:32,"Masturbate, yes."
135,00:11:32,00:11:34,"Ejaculate, no."
136,00:11:34,00:11:37,So the semen that I found on his bed is someone else's?
137,00:11:37,00:11:39,Likely.
138,00:11:39,00:11:41,Thanks.
139,00:11:41,00:11:43,Sure.
140,00:11:43,00:11:48,"Hey, guys, I found semen in the victim's room and it's probably not his."
141,00:11:48,00:11:50,He was chemically castrated.
142,00:11:50,00:11:53,So you're thinking the donor could be the killer?
143,00:11:53,00:11:58,Sex is the foreplay. Violence is the climax.
144,00:11:59,00:12:01,Well... happy swabbing.
145,00:12:03,00:12:04,They've been prepped.
146,00:12:05,00:12:07,You're all set.
147,00:12:07,00:12:08,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
148,00:12:08,00:12:10,"Here you go, padre."
149,00:12:10,00:12:12,Wash your worries away.
150,00:12:12,00:12:14,Thank you.
151,00:12:16,00:12:18,"Well, you take that side."
152,00:12:21,00:12:22,I'll take Jiminy Cricket.
153,00:12:22,00:12:24,Excellent.
154,00:12:26,00:12:28,(indistinct P.A. announcement)
155,00:12:31,00:12:32,Say ah.
156,00:12:32,00:12:33,Ah.
157,00:12:35,00:12:36,Thank you.
158,00:12:36,00:12:38,(thunder rumbling)
159,00:12:40,00:12:42,Say ah.
160,00:12:46,00:12:47,"You, too, Leon."
161,00:12:47,00:12:48,I work here.
162,00:12:48,00:12:50,Exactly.
163,00:12:53,00:12:54,"Open your mouth, please."
164,00:12:56,00:12:57,"Would you open your mouth, sir?"
165,00:13:00,00:13:02,(muttering)
166,00:13:02,00:13:05,Grissom...
167,00:13:05,00:13:07,you take this one.
168,00:13:07,00:13:08,(muttering)
169,00:13:10,00:13:11,(car horn blares)
170,00:13:14,00:13:16,Let's start with the stomach contents.
171,00:13:16,00:13:18,They're fascinating.
172,00:13:18,00:13:22,It reminded me of that scene inJaws where Dreyfuss cuts open the shark's belly and all kinds of weird things come out.
173,00:13:22,00:13:25,You find a license plate?
174,00:13:25,00:13:27,Not quite.
175,00:13:27,00:13:32,"Highlights include Band-Aids, wood chips, hair and half a snapshot."
176,00:13:32,00:13:34,Pica?
177,00:13:34,00:13:35,Boo?
178,00:13:37,00:13:41,Pica is a compulsion to eat non-nutritive food items.
179,00:13:41,00:13:45,"It's from the Latin word for magpie, a bird with a large and indiscriminate appetite."
180,00:13:45,00:13:51,Trichotillomania would explain the pulling out and eating of hair.
181,00:13:51,00:13:53,Another OCD disorder.
182,00:13:53,00:13:56,I sent hair and blood samples to Tox.
183,00:13:56,00:13:58,Stellate lacerations.
184,00:13:58,00:14:01,Linear skull fracture extending into the calvarium.
185,00:14:01,00:14:04,And contre-coup contusions to the frontal and temporal lobes.
186,00:14:04,00:14:07,So C.O.D. was blunt force trauma?
187,00:14:07,00:14:08,No. Asphyxiation.
188,00:14:08,00:14:10,During the struggle?
189,00:14:10,00:14:17,"No. Coagulation of the blood tells me that the head trauma was post-mortem, at least two hours after he was suffocated."
190,00:14:17,00:14:20,So evidently dead wasn't dead enough.
191,00:14:20,00:14:26,I also found ligature marks on the wrists and ankles.
192,00:14:26,00:14:29,"They showed up during the Y, peri-mortem."
193,00:14:29,00:14:32,"So, what, tortured? Tied up?"
194,00:14:32,00:14:34,Restrained.
195,00:14:39,00:14:41,Nobody mentioned restraints.
196,00:14:45,00:14:47,HODGES: Would you ever bleach your hair?
197,00:14:47,00:14:48,I wouldn't.
198,00:14:48,00:14:50,It's so Greg Sanders.
199,00:14:50,00:14:55,"Most of the hair is the vic's, but I also found that bleached sample as well."
200,00:14:55,00:15:00,"In my continuing quest to further my standing, I took it upon myself to get you the tox report."
201,00:15:00,00:15:01,Thanks. You're welcome.
202,00:15:01,00:15:04,Blood came back with pretty hefty levels of Olanzapine.
203,00:15:04,00:15:06,That's a potent anti-psychotic.
204,00:15:06,00:15:07,Good for drooling.
205,00:15:07,00:15:12,"And also there's the, uh, not so potent smattering of Ibuprofen."
206,00:15:12,00:15:13,That's it? That's it.
207,00:15:14,00:15:19,"If I were institutionalized, I think I would hope for something better."
208,00:15:19,00:15:21,"Clonazepam, maybe."
209,00:15:21,00:15:24,"What, you, uh, think I'm crazy?"
210,00:15:24,00:15:26,Crazy is as crazy does.
211,00:15:26,00:15:30,His chart indicated at least four other anti-psychotics.
212,00:15:30,00:15:32,Why wasn't he getting those meds?
213,00:15:32,00:15:35,Do I look clairvoyant?
214,00:15:35,00:15:37,BRASS: News flash from the loony bin.
215,00:15:37,00:15:45,"Two reported deaths in the last three years from ""complications due to restraint procedures."" And how many have gone unreported?"
216,00:15:45,00:15:47,The hospital just got off probation.
217,00:15:47,00:15:49,One more death by restraint brings the Feds in.
218,00:15:49,00:15:51,Good incentive to keep it quiet.
219,00:15:51,00:15:53,Or make it look like someone else did it.
220,00:15:53,00:15:56,Yeah. Somebody who's crazy.
221,00:15:56,00:15:58,DUNBAR: We're legally required to tape all our sessions.
222,00:15:58,00:16:03,This is Robbie in the seclusion room the day he died.
223,00:16:11,00:16:12,(fast-forwarding tape)
224,00:16:13,00:16:17,"As you can see, the on-call doctor and Nurse Mckay checked in on him."
225,00:16:19,00:16:24,"Two hours later, he was escorted out, so I resent the accusation."
226,00:16:24,00:16:27,We've made a lot of changes.
227,00:16:27,00:16:30,"Policy, staff, surveillance have all been overhauled."
228,00:16:30,00:16:34,"Look, Robbie left the seclusion room alive."
229,00:16:34,00:16:35,"Okay, fine."
230,00:16:35,00:16:37,Who administers medication?
231,00:16:37,00:16:38,"Uh, the nurses, psych techs."
232,00:16:39,00:16:40,Why is this important?
233,00:16:40,00:16:44,"Well, according to his tox results, Robbie's system was short four anti-psychotics."
234,00:16:44,00:16:46,Maybe he was cheeking them.
235,00:16:56,00:16:57,Why would he do that?
236,00:16:57,00:16:59,They think they don't need 'em.
237,00:16:59,00:17:00,"They sell 'em, trade 'em or..."
238,00:17:00,00:17:02,"store them up, get high later."
239,00:17:02,00:17:05,We're gonna need to talk to his pharmacist.
240,00:17:06,00:17:08,"Who's next? Oh, come on, Earl."
241,00:17:08,00:17:09,There you go.
242,00:17:12,00:17:15,"Hey, you know I'm gonna bust your ass on the court, right?"
243,00:17:15,00:17:17,You better bring your 'A' game next time.
244,00:17:17,00:17:19,"Come on, Chuck, I got something for you."
245,00:17:28,00:17:30,"Love your hair, Leon."
246,00:17:30,00:17:31,Thanks.
247,00:17:31,00:17:33,What do you got here?
248,00:17:33,00:17:37,"Ibuprofen, laxative, aspirin."
249,00:17:37,00:17:41,"What are you treating exactly, schizophrenia or constipation?"
250,00:17:41,00:17:43,"Where are the real drugs, Leon?"
251,00:17:48,00:18:01,"Man... Xanax, Lanzopine, Zoloft, Suprazadone, Clozapine, Loranzapan, lithium, Valium, Wellbutrin, Haldol, Respiredone."
252,00:18:01,00:18:04,You took everything with street value.
253,00:18:04,00:18:06,"(chuckles): Look, dude..."
254,00:18:06,00:18:08,I get 22K a year.
255,00:18:08,00:18:09,That's nothing.
256,00:18:09,00:18:11,Diddly-squat.
257,00:18:11,00:18:13,I should get hazard pay.
258,00:18:13,00:18:15,"These people, I get..."
259,00:18:15,00:18:17,"I get spit on, puked on, peed on, bitten."
260,00:18:17,00:18:22,"I get my hair yanked out, I get my ass pinched, I get... I get death threats."
261,00:18:22,00:18:24,All for 22K.
262,00:18:24,00:18:26,So I supplement my income.
263,00:18:26,00:18:28,It don't hurt nobody.
264,00:18:28,00:18:30,Are you a doctor?
265,00:18:30,00:18:34,"Look, these places, they overmedicate all the time."
266,00:18:34,00:18:36,It controls the population.
267,00:18:36,00:18:39,"And I don't endanger the patients, okay?"
268,00:18:39,00:18:41,I-I'm all about the patients.
269,00:18:41,00:18:45,"Maybe Robbie caught you skimping on his meds, threatened to blow the whistle."
270,00:18:45,00:18:46,There goes that supplemental income.
271,00:18:49,00:18:51,I see what you're doing.
272,00:18:51,00:18:54,I'm reporting you. You're stealing.
273,00:18:54,00:18:55,"Robbie, hold on a second, will you?"
274,00:18:55,00:18:59,(screaming)
275,00:19:01,00:19:05,"All right, here you go, here you go, here you go."
276,00:19:05,00:19:08,(continues screaming)
277,00:19:13,00:19:15,"No. All right, no way, man."
278,00:19:15,00:19:17,That's a story.
279,00:19:17,00:19:19,'Kay? That's not why he went to seclusion.
280,00:19:19,00:19:21,Why did he go to seclusion?
281,00:19:21,00:19:22,He freaked out in group.
282,00:19:23,00:19:24,I wasn't even there.
283,00:19:24,00:19:26,Ask somebody who was.
284,00:19:27,00:19:29,Am I gonna lose my job?
285,00:19:29,00:19:32,'Cause these people...
286,00:19:32,00:19:34,need me.
287,00:19:34,00:19:39,"SIDLE: According to the video logs, the victim was brought into seclusion at 5:03 p.m."
288,00:19:39,00:19:41,and taken out of the room at 7:06 p.m.
289,00:19:41,00:19:47,Nurse Mckay noted that he was awake and in bed at the 9:30 p.m. bed-checks.
290,00:19:48,00:19:51,Body was found at 12:10.
291,00:19:51,00:19:54,"So sometime between 9:30 and midnight, he was suffocated."
292,00:19:54,00:19:56,Probably closer to 9:30.
293,00:19:56,00:20:00,The blood would've needed time to coagulate before his head was smashed in.
294,00:20:00,00:20:03,And not necessarily by the same person.
295,00:20:03,00:20:05,"Hey, how about some pillow talk?"
296,00:20:05,00:20:07,Robbie's pillow had saliva on it.
297,00:20:07,00:20:09,Lots of it; all his.
298,00:20:09,00:20:10,Could be from drooling.
299,00:20:11,00:20:13,Or it could be from dying.
300,00:20:13,00:20:17,"Well, look at this-- I found slits at both ends."
301,00:20:17,00:20:18,Left hand...
302,00:20:18,00:20:20,and right hand.
303,00:20:23,00:20:25,Looks like we have a murder weapon.
304,00:20:26,00:20:31,"WOMAN (over P.A.): All past-level-three patients, please return to your unit for a head count."
305,00:20:33,00:20:36,"All past-level-three patients, please return to your unit..."
306,00:20:36,00:20:38,"Thanks, Officer."
307,00:20:38,00:20:40,"Nurse Mckay, hi."
308,00:20:40,00:20:44,Dr. Dino said that you supervised group therapy yesterday.
309,00:20:45,00:20:49,"Uh, yeah. I heard there was an incident involving Robbie."
310,00:20:49,00:20:51,He had a personal item.
311,00:20:51,00:20:53,A personal item?
312,00:20:53,00:20:57,You can't bring anything in group except a beverage.
313,00:20:57,00:20:59,It distracts the other patients.
314,00:20:59,00:21:00,What did he bring?
315,00:21:00,00:21:02,A photograph.
316,00:21:02,00:21:04,Of what?
317,00:21:04,00:21:07,A little boy.
318,00:21:08,00:21:10,What did you do?
319,00:21:10,00:21:13,I followed protocol.
320,00:21:13,00:21:14,Anybody else have anything they want to talk about?
321,00:21:14,00:21:17,MAN: I wanna know why everybody's always staring at me-- especially him.
322,00:21:17,00:21:19,He's staring at me.
323,00:21:19,00:21:21,"I'm not staring at... Hang on, hang on."
324,00:21:21,00:21:22,Robbie?
325,00:21:23,00:21:26,What have you got there? Nothing.
326,00:21:26,00:21:27,Fag candy.
327,00:21:27,00:21:28,"Well, what's the rule?"
328,00:21:28,00:21:30,There's no personal items...
329,00:21:30,00:21:31,No!
330,00:21:31,00:21:32,Give me the... No!
331,00:21:32,00:21:33,No! Don't touch me!
332,00:21:33,00:21:35,(Robbie shouting)
333,00:21:36,00:21:39,"Boom, boom and boom: medication, seclusion, restraint."
334,00:21:39,00:21:43,Tough love. Call it what you want-- these aren't my children.
335,00:21:43,00:21:46,Why didn't you mention this information last night?
336,00:21:46,00:21:49,Because crap like that happens every day here.
337,00:21:50,00:21:53,I should get back to the unit. Sure.
338,00:21:53,00:21:56,(phone rings)
339,00:21:56,00:21:58,Sidle.
340,00:21:58,00:22:01,GRISSOM: We got the DNA results back on the semen on Robbie's sheets.
341,00:22:01,00:22:04,Patient Adam Trent-- the nail biter.
342,00:22:04,00:22:05,Okay.
343,00:22:13,00:22:15,This stuff is dark.
344,00:22:15,00:22:17,Yeah.
345,00:22:17,00:22:21,"'Course, I wouldn't expect Winnie the Pooh."
346,00:22:23,00:22:25,Adam's subconscious was working overtime.
347,00:22:25,00:22:29,SIDLE: I bet you aced your Rorschachs.
348,00:22:29,00:22:34,"When I was in fifth grade, I drew a picture of a harpooned whale."
349,00:22:34,00:22:36,Everyone thought I was gonzo'd.
350,00:22:36,00:22:38,But I had just read Moby Dick.
351,00:22:39,00:22:43,Sometimes a dying whale is just a dying whale.
352,00:23:23,00:23:25,These are all postdated over a year ago.
353,00:23:30,00:23:31,It's not just his subconscious.
354,00:23:31,00:23:33,This guy's got stuff buried everywhere.
355,00:23:37,00:23:40,"DR. DINO: ""Dearest Angel, I think of you wherever I go."
356,00:23:40,00:23:42,"""You are my prince. I miss you."
357,00:23:42,00:23:46,"Write to me. Your only love, Mother."" Another one."
358,00:23:46,00:23:48,"Uh... ""It rained today."
359,00:23:48,00:23:51,"""I thought of that time when you and I got caught ""in the storm at the lake."
360,00:23:51,00:23:54,"""The fire... I came home and made your favorite dinner."
361,00:23:54,00:23:57,"I even set a place for you..."" So on and so forth."
362,00:23:57,00:23:59,That does not sound maternal to me.
363,00:23:59,00:24:01,It's not.
364,00:24:01,00:24:02,Incest?
365,00:24:02,00:24:03,Fully consummated.
366,00:24:03,00:24:07,Mother-son incest is rare and deeply pathological.
367,00:24:07,00:24:09,Oedipal complex taken too far?
368,00:24:09,00:24:10,Oedipus...
369,00:24:10,00:24:11,implies son to mother.
370,00:24:11,00:24:15,"In this case, the mother was seeking the love and creating the codependence."
371,00:24:15,00:24:17,We call this a Jocasta complex.
372,00:24:17,00:24:19,Oedipus' mother.
373,00:24:19,00:24:22,When Adam was nine his father died.
374,00:24:22,00:24:24,His mother replaced her dead husband with her son.
375,00:24:25,00:24:26,That's got to mess you up.
376,00:24:26,00:24:32,"Yeah. Adam is schizo-affective, suicidal, and a pathological narcissist."
377,00:24:32,00:24:41,"When he was a teenager he was unable to retaliate against his mother and incapable of actual intimacy, so... he started raping woman."
378,00:24:41,00:24:43,GRISSOM: Always women?
379,00:24:43,00:24:46,Yes. Which is why I don't think he killed Robbie.
380,00:24:46,00:24:48,We found Adam's semen in Robbie's bed.
381,00:24:48,00:24:50,"You see, that surprises me."
382,00:24:50,00:24:54,"Like any good psychopath, he rarely veers from his pattern."
383,00:24:54,00:24:58,Adam is a single-celled organism who exists wholly for himself.
384,00:25:00,00:25:02,He must've been getting something tangible in return.
385,00:25:02,00:25:03,What?
386,00:25:03,00:25:06,Drugs? Cigarettes?
387,00:25:06,00:25:07,Drugs aren't his issue.
388,00:25:07,00:25:10,And as far as I know he doesn't smoke. Um...
389,00:25:10,00:25:12,"So, uh, what can we learn from his art work?"
390,00:25:12,00:25:22,"Uh... He starts with an innocuous object; a tree, a cat, an oboe-- all of which he morphs into something deadly. You can see..."
391,00:25:23,00:25:25,all of them.
392,00:25:25,00:25:29,So what should be safe turns into something unsafe.
393,00:25:29,00:25:31,Mother becomes lover.
394,00:25:31,00:25:32,What about the mother?
395,00:25:32,00:25:34,Do you have any idea where she is?
396,00:25:34,00:25:36,She lives near Reno.
397,00:25:36,00:25:39,"Based on the postmarks, it seems like she stopped writing him."
398,00:25:40,00:25:45,"Every time a letter came a manic episode followed, then a severe depression, including one suicide attempt."
399,00:25:45,00:25:51,So I started sending the letters back.
400,00:25:51,00:25:53,"Eventually, she stopped writing."
401,00:25:55,00:25:58,(thunder softly rumbles)
402,00:26:00,00:26:03,Did I kill him?
403,00:26:03,00:26:06,Yes.
404,00:26:06,00:26:07,Why?
405,00:26:07,00:26:10,He was queer.
406,00:26:10,00:26:12,But you had sex with him.
407,00:26:15,00:26:17,No.
408,00:26:17,00:26:19,He had sex with me.
409,00:26:19,00:26:21,He was the punk.
410,00:26:21,00:26:24,Was it consensual?
411,00:26:24,00:26:26,I don't know.
412,00:26:26,00:26:28,So why did you do it?
413,00:26:28,00:26:31,I don't know.
414,00:26:31,00:26:33,SIDLE: Okay.
415,00:26:34,00:26:36,So then what happened?
416,00:26:36,00:26:38,I took his head and I smashed it into the floor.
417,00:26:41,00:26:44,And that's how you killed him?
418,00:26:48,00:26:50,What? You don't believe me?
419,00:26:50,00:26:52,I'm just wondering if that's how you killed him.
420,00:26:52,00:26:54,Yes. I'm saying this and this is true.
421,00:26:54,00:26:59,"And if you don't believe me, just look in the bucket in the latrine."
422,00:26:59,00:27:00,Okay...
423,00:27:01,00:27:05,Do you really want to know why I killed him?
424,00:27:05,00:27:06,Yes.
425,00:27:13,00:27:16,It's because I'm crazy.
426,00:27:22,00:27:25,Not a word about suffocation.
427,00:27:25,00:27:28,"Well, his nails weren't long enough to leave those tears in the pillow."
428,00:27:28,00:27:30,And there would have been traces of blood from his cuticles.
429,00:27:30,00:27:32,Something is off.
430,00:27:53,00:27:56,Here's the blood splatter we've been looking for.
431,00:28:03,00:28:05,What is that on the crotch?
432,00:28:07,00:28:09,Lipstick.
433,00:28:15,00:28:18,(rain splashing)
434,00:28:20,00:28:21,Where is Nurse Mckay?
435,00:28:21,00:28:23,I need to talk to her.
436,00:28:23,00:28:25,She's on lunch duty.
437,00:28:25,00:28:32,"All right. I can either take this and the underwear back to the lab and confirm the match, which will only extend our presence here."
438,00:28:32,00:28:34,Or...
439,00:28:34,00:28:37,you can give me access to the nurse's station right now.
440,00:28:40,00:28:43,"WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Walsh, please call your service."
441,00:28:43,00:28:45,"Dr. Walsh, call your service, stat."
442,00:28:45,00:28:50,SIDLE: This must be the photo that Nurse Mckay confiscated from Robbie in group.
443,00:28:50,00:28:52,The missing half?
444,00:28:52,00:28:56,I found blue tape in Robbie's room.
445,00:28:56,00:28:58,Kind of looks like Adam.
446,00:28:58,00:29:00,Where would Robbie get a picture of Adam?
447,00:29:00,00:29:03,"Well, they were having sex."
448,00:29:12,00:29:14,I'm going to find someone who can open these drawers.
449,00:29:14,00:29:16,Okay.
450,00:29:16,00:29:20,"WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Stoon, please pick up the white telephone."
451,00:29:20,00:29:23,"Dr. Stoon, call on the white telephone."
452,00:29:38,00:29:40,Hey.
453,00:29:47,00:29:49,Are you a spiritual person?
454,00:29:49,00:29:52,Sometimes.
455,00:29:52,00:29:56,Do you believe that everything happens for a reason?
456,00:29:56,00:29:59,That bad things are there to teach us a karmic lesson?
457,00:29:59,00:30:04,"You know, maybe all our problems can be cured by tuning in to a higher frequency."
458,00:30:04,00:30:14,"There's this one guy I read, he believes that illness, anxiety and fear all occur when people are vibrating at 10,000 cycles a second."
459,00:30:15,00:30:17,(groaning)
460,00:30:23,00:30:32,"If they could just get up to 100,000 cycles per second they'd be in the realm of sound, light and spirit, and everything would be just fine. Right?"
461,00:30:32,00:30:33,Yeah.
462,00:30:33,00:30:34,ADAM: You know what I think?
463,00:30:34,00:30:38,I think I'm just vibrating at the wrong frequency.
464,00:30:38,00:30:39,SIDLE: It's okay.
465,00:30:39,00:30:42,ADAM: Do you think I'm smart?
466,00:30:42,00:30:43,Yeah. Yeah?
467,00:30:43,00:30:44,Uh-huh.
468,00:30:44,00:30:46,Do you think I'm right?
469,00:30:46,00:30:47,SIDLE: I do. Open the door.
470,00:30:47,00:30:49,I can't. I don't have my keys to open the door.
471,00:30:49,00:30:51,Don't you move.
472,00:30:51,00:30:52,Please open the door.
473,00:30:52,00:30:54,"You move a muscle I will grind you, bitch."
474,00:30:55,00:30:55,You hear me?
475,00:30:55,00:30:56,Do not look at them.
476,00:30:56,00:30:57,Keep your eyes on the floor.
477,00:30:58,00:31:01,"You! You, go away! You! You, go away!"
478,00:31:01,00:31:02,No!
479,00:31:04,00:31:05,"Adam, stop!"
480,00:31:06,00:31:08,Get a medic in here!
481,00:31:08,00:31:09,Hold still.
482,00:31:09,00:31:10,Apple pressure!
483,00:31:10,00:31:14,Where is he? Where is he?
484,00:31:14,00:31:15,(Adam crying)
485,00:31:15,00:31:17,We need some help in here!
486,00:31:29,00:31:34,"When my father died, my mother came to a place like this for awhile for evaluation."
487,00:31:36,00:31:40,"It looked the same, it smelled the same."
488,00:31:40,00:31:41,It smelled like lies.
489,00:31:43,00:31:45,You sure you're okay?
490,00:31:45,00:31:49,Crazy people do make me feel crazy.
491,00:31:50,00:31:54,"If you want, I can have somebody take your place."
492,00:31:54,00:31:57,I appreciate that.
493,00:31:57,00:32:00,"I do, I really do, but..."
494,00:32:02,00:32:07,I kind of made a decision to move beyond that and...
495,00:32:07,00:32:09,I really want to finish this case.
496,00:32:09,00:32:10,We have rules for a reason.
497,00:32:10,00:32:12,You people come in here disrupting things.
498,00:32:12,00:32:15,You're unsafe. This is your fault.
499,00:32:15,00:32:16,Really?
500,00:32:17,00:32:19,You seem to take your job rather personally.
501,00:32:19,00:32:20,What are you suggesting?
502,00:32:20,00:32:23,That you had an intimate relationship with Adam Trent.
503,00:32:23,00:32:25,That's ridiculous.
504,00:32:25,00:32:26,Your lipstick is on his underwear.
505,00:32:27,00:32:28,I gave Robbie my lipstick sometimes.
506,00:32:28,00:32:29,Maybe he was wearing it when...
507,00:32:29,00:32:31,We didn't find any on his lips.
508,00:32:31,00:32:36,"Well, that's your problem."
509,00:32:36,00:32:37,What are you waiting for?
510,00:32:37,00:32:40,"Get him to the medical unit, stat."
511,00:33:10,00:33:13,Excuse me.
512,00:33:14,00:33:16,Adam Trent was working on this piece?
513,00:33:17,00:33:18,Yes.
514,00:33:18,00:33:20,He made it on Monday.
515,00:33:20,00:33:23,But he never got a chance to fire it.
516,00:33:23,00:33:27,"Nurse Mckay came in, they had a conversation."
517,00:33:27,00:33:31,"Actually, it was more of an argument, very heated, very loud."
518,00:33:38,00:33:41,And then she yanked him out of class.
519,00:33:41,00:33:43,Was this on the wheel while they were arguing?
520,00:33:43,00:33:45,Yeah.
521,00:33:48,00:33:50,Adam's work is very provocative.
522,00:33:50,00:33:52,Yeah.
523,00:33:52,00:33:55,It speaks to me.
524,00:33:55,00:33:57,SIDLE: Acoustic Archeology?
525,00:33:57,00:34:01,"In the '60s, experiments were done on clay pots and painted canvas."
526,00:34:01,00:34:07,Scientists were able to ferret out sounds that were captured during the creative process in the clay and the paint.
527,00:34:07,00:34:08,Trippy.
528,00:34:08,00:34:11,It's actually not that out there.
529,00:34:11,00:34:19,"In the old days, the first gramophone recordings were made by taking the vibrations of sound and cutting them into wax cylinders while they were turning."
530,00:34:22,00:34:29,"Based on the frequency and intensity of the sound, the stylus cut into the wax, creating distinct variances of depth and width."
531,00:34:32,00:34:41,"For playback, a mechanical transducer vibrated along a groove, generating a current which, when amplified, turned into sound."
532,00:34:41,00:34:48,"When the art therapist told me that there'd been an argument while Adam was on the wheel, I thought well, maybe we can pull some sound off his pot."
533,00:34:48,00:34:50,SIDLE: Doppler laser.
534,00:34:50,00:34:51,Optical transducer.
535,00:34:51,00:34:53,We've come a long way.
536,00:34:53,00:34:54,Baby.
537,00:34:57,00:34:58,(beeps)
538,00:34:58,00:35:01,"Well, there's something there."
539,00:35:03,00:35:05,And it sounds like...
540,00:35:05,00:35:06,(beeps)
541,00:35:06,00:35:08,this.
542,00:35:08,00:35:10,(static)
543,00:35:10,00:35:11,It's lousy signal-to-noise.
544,00:35:11,00:35:14,It's going to need a lot of processing.
545,00:35:19,00:35:20,(warbling)
546,00:35:23,00:35:26,(warbling)
547,00:35:26,00:35:27,Speech elements skew to consonants.
548,00:35:28,00:35:30,I'll try and dig them out.
549,00:35:30,00:35:32,(computer beeps)
550,00:35:34,00:35:36,(warbling)
551,00:35:38,00:35:42,Rrr-bee... Rrr-bee...
552,00:35:42,00:35:43,Robbie?
553,00:35:44,00:35:45,Maybe.
554,00:35:45,00:35:48,Could you run that back a little bit?
555,00:35:48,00:35:49,Sure.
556,00:35:49,00:35:51,(warbles)
557,00:35:51,00:35:52,What is that?
558,00:35:52,00:35:55,(warble repeats)
559,00:35:55,00:35:56,Right there.
560,00:35:57,00:36:00,Nnn-gl. Nnn-gl...
561,00:36:00,00:36:02,Angle?
562,00:36:02,00:36:03,Angel.
563,00:36:03,00:36:05,...my angel.
564,00:36:05,00:36:07,My angel. My angel.
565,00:36:09,00:36:22,"In her letters, Adam's mother called him ""angel."" The hair from the brush in Adam's room was fresh enough to get a DNA profile."
566,00:36:22,00:36:23,It came back female.
567,00:36:24,00:36:26,We tested it against your cigarette butt.
568,00:36:26,00:36:28,It matched.
569,00:36:28,00:36:30,Adam liked it when I brushed his hair.
570,00:36:30,00:36:32,I bet he did.
571,00:36:32,00:36:36,You were lying about giving Robbie lipstick.
572,00:36:36,00:36:44,"You have seven out of 13 alleles in common with your patient, Adam Trent."
573,00:36:44,00:36:47,Your dearest angel.
574,00:36:47,00:36:49,Okay.
575,00:36:49,00:36:53,"Joanne Mckay, registered nurse, licensed by the Nevada Board of Nursing 1978."
576,00:36:53,00:36:56,Married Howard Trent 1980.
577,00:36:56,00:37:00,The board requires you to get a new certificate when you get married.
578,00:37:00,00:37:01,I guess you never complied.
579,00:37:01,00:37:03,I've always gone by my maiden name.
580,00:37:03,00:37:07,I guess that makes it less embarrassing to check into the motel with your son.
581,00:37:09,00:37:10,"Oh, I'm sorry."
582,00:37:10,00:37:12,You checked into a psycho ward instead.
583,00:37:12,00:37:13,My son needed me.
584,00:37:14,00:37:15,SIDLE: For what?
585,00:37:15,00:37:17,To destroy his ego?
586,00:37:17,00:37:19,To fill him with guilt?
587,00:37:19,00:37:24,To make him hate himself so much he would take his own life just to be free of you?
588,00:37:24,00:37:28,You have no idea what goes on between us.
589,00:37:28,00:37:30,"Let's cut the umbilical cord, okay?"
590,00:37:30,00:37:33,Six months ago your letters started to come back.
591,00:37:33,00:37:36,No more communication with little Lord Fauntleroy.
592,00:37:36,00:37:38,So you apply to Desert State.
593,00:37:38,00:37:41,"They were desperate for nursing staff, so you got a job."
594,00:37:41,00:37:44,"Gentlemen, this is our new nurse, Nurse Mckay."
595,00:37:44,00:37:49,Hello.
596,00:37:49,00:37:53,Bet it's tough to turn a folie á deux into a menage á trois.
597,00:37:53,00:37:55,N'est-ce pas?
598,00:38:00,00:38:04,Even tougher that your son was cheating on you...
599,00:38:04,00:38:07,with a man no less.
600,00:38:12,00:38:14,You need to stop this.
601,00:38:14,00:38:16,Stop what?
602,00:38:16,00:38:18,End it with Robbie.
603,00:38:18,00:38:20,Don't tell me what to do.
604,00:38:20,00:38:22,End it or I will.
605,00:38:23,00:38:25,"But he didn't end it, did he?"
606,00:38:25,00:38:28,Robbie was lover's leverage.
607,00:38:28,00:38:34,He was that thing that Adam kept in his back pocket and pull out whenever he needed to distance himself from you.
608,00:38:34,00:38:37,So you had no choice but to get rid of Robbie.
609,00:38:37,00:38:40,"And being a good nurse, you knew his trigger."
610,00:38:43,00:38:46,I want you to talk about this in group today.
611,00:38:46,00:38:47,B-But I thought that we...
612,00:38:47,00:38:48,It's okay. You can bring it.
613,00:38:50,00:38:52,Hey! Robbie.
614,00:38:53,00:38:54,What do you got there?
615,00:38:55,00:38:57,There's no personal items in group.
616,00:38:57,00:38:58,B-But y-you... you told me...
617,00:38:58,00:38:59,that I could bring this.
618,00:38:59,00:39:01,I didn't say anything. Give me that.
619,00:39:01,00:39:02,"What is that, a picture?"
620,00:39:02,00:39:04,You remember? Give me the picture.
621,00:39:04,00:39:05,"No, do you remember?"
622,00:39:05,00:39:06,You remember? No! Give me the picture.
623,00:39:06,00:39:07,"No, you don't tell me!"
624,00:39:07,00:39:08,You told me...!
625,00:39:08,00:39:10,(yelling) Hang on!
626,00:39:10,00:39:12,(screaming)
627,00:39:19,00:39:23,(muffled screams)
628,00:39:23,00:39:28,You manipulated the situation and took advantage of his weakness.
629,00:39:28,00:39:32,SIDLE: Exactly what you have been doing to Adam for the past 20 years.
630,00:39:32,00:39:37,"And being such a good mother, you made him cover it up."
631,00:39:37,00:39:39,Again.
632,00:39:58,00:40:01,Why would my son do that?
633,00:40:01,00:40:04,Because he loves you as much as he hates you.
634,00:40:07,00:40:09,You can't prove any of this.
635,00:40:09,00:40:12,"Just the incest, which is a Class B felony."
636,00:40:12,00:40:14,It carries a penalty of up to ten years.
637,00:40:14,00:40:17,That's ten years away from Adam.
638,00:40:17,00:40:21,Good luck getting him to testify.
639,00:40:25,00:40:27,Okay.
640,00:40:37,00:40:41,"Well, jail or no jail, I don't think she'll last six months."
641,00:40:41,00:40:45,She'll die without her son.
642,00:40:45,00:40:49,That would be better for both of them.
