0,00:00:02,00:00:04,(eerie tones playing)
1,00:00:19,00:00:21,SWAT LEADER (distorted): Get the paramedics.
2,00:00:21,00:00:23,"Hang in there, Jim, hang in there."
3,00:00:23,00:00:24,Right here. Right here.
4,00:00:24,00:00:27,Good job.
5,00:00:28,00:00:30,"Sir, sir, can you see me?"
6,00:00:30,00:00:32,"Sir, can you hear me?"
7,00:00:33,00:00:34,"Sir, stay with me. Sir?"
8,00:00:34,00:00:37,He's got a pulse of 120.
9,00:00:48,00:00:51,"(distorted, indistinct chatter)"
10,00:01:25,00:01:31,"PARAMEDIC: 55 year-old male, GSW left anterior chest, entering at the level of the deltoid and AC joint."
11,00:01:31,00:01:32,Minimally responsive.
12,00:01:32,00:01:33,He's a cop.
13,00:01:33,00:01:39,"Tachycardic in the 120s, BP's 86 over 40 and dropping, 02 stats in the 80s with assisted ventilation..."
14,00:01:40,00:01:42,"Okay, we're losing a lot of blood here."
15,00:01:42,00:01:44,We need two large-bore I.V.'s.
16,00:01:44,00:01:46,"Run the fluids wide, he's extremely hypotensive."
17,00:01:46,00:01:49,Absent breath sounds on the left.
18,00:01:49,00:01:50,Likely pneumothorax.
19,00:01:50,00:01:53,Let's put in a chest tube and pressors for that BP stat.
20,00:01:55,00:01:57,(machine beeps) He's in V-fib!
21,00:01:57,00:01:59,(undistorted): Paddles!
22,00:02:01,00:02:03,(high-pitched whine)
23,00:02:05,00:02:07,(heart monitor flatlines)
24,00:02:07,00:02:09,Three hundred!
25,00:02:09,00:02:11,Clear!
26,00:02:13,00:02:14,Come on. Come on!
27,00:02:14,00:02:15,Come on.
28,00:02:16,00:02:17,Three-sixty!
29,00:02:17,00:02:19,Clear!
30,00:02:25,00:02:32,"BRASS: I envy these parents who live in ignorant bliss because I know how my daughter, Ellie, lives."
31,00:02:32,00:02:35,I know the company she keeps and I know what she does to get by.
32,00:02:35,00:02:46,"And... anyway, I mean, I'm... I'm... a couple of nights ago I'm in LA and sitting in my car on Hollywood Boulevard watching her work a corner."
33,00:02:46,00:02:50,"And my eyes are playing tricks on me because I don't see what she's doing, I see what she was."
34,00:02:50,00:02:56,"I see a little six year-old girl with a ponytail, playing with crayons..."
35,00:02:59,00:03:02,...singing a little tune to herself.
36,00:03:02,00:03:05,"It's... I don't know, all I want to do is save her."
37,00:03:06,00:03:09,"But the thing is, you know, if something happened to me..."
38,00:03:09,00:03:13,"I don't think Ellie would, uh... care."
39,00:03:15,00:03:18,So I'm asking you to do me this favor.
40,00:03:18,00:03:23,"There's no one I trust more with my life, or my death... than you."
41,00:03:24,00:03:27,Captain Brass was shot twice.
42,00:03:27,00:03:29,First bullet lodged in his vest.
43,00:03:29,00:03:33,"Second entered through his axilla, hit an artery, and is lodged near his heart."
44,00:03:33,00:03:35,He's has internal hemorrhaging.
45,00:03:35,00:03:36,Any neural damage?
46,00:03:36,00:03:38,We won't know until we stop the bleeding.
47,00:03:38,00:03:40,If we stop it.
48,00:03:40,00:03:42,Have next-of-kin been notified?
49,00:03:42,00:03:46,"For medical purposes, I have his power of attorney."
50,00:03:46,00:03:50,You may have a decision to make.
51,00:03:50,00:03:51,I'll let you know.
52,00:03:54,00:03:56,(ringing)
53,00:03:57,00:03:59,Grissom.
54,00:03:59,00:04:01,Yeah.
55,00:04:01,00:04:04,Okay.
56,00:04:06,00:04:08,D.B. in Henderson on the train tracks.
57,00:04:10,00:04:12,I'll take the first watch.
58,00:04:12,00:04:13,You go work.
59,00:04:21,00:04:23,CURTIS: I just spoke with McKeen.
60,00:04:23,00:04:24,I heard it's bad.
61,00:04:24,00:04:26,GRISSOM: Pretty bad.
62,00:04:26,00:04:28,They're trying to stabilize him.
63,00:04:29,00:04:32,The last train passed through here an hour ago.
64,00:04:32,00:04:35,"The engineer thought he saw a body on the track, but couldn't stop on time."
65,00:04:35,00:04:39,"He radioed dispatcher, who called 911."
66,00:04:39,00:04:40,No I.D.
67,00:04:40,00:04:43,Probably decapitated by the train.
68,00:04:43,00:04:47,"Well, if scavengers nicked his clothes, they left a nice pair of riding boots."
69,00:04:47,00:04:51,They probably didn't have time to finish the job before other trains roared through here.
70,00:04:51,00:04:56,"Well, the engineer isn't saying anything else until his union rep gets here, which... could be a while."
71,00:04:56,00:04:58,I'll let you know.
72,00:04:58,00:05:00,Great.
73,00:05:01,00:05:06,"You know, there's not a lot of blood on the ground for a decapitation like this."
74,00:05:07,00:05:10,"Well, we don't know how far he was dragged."
75,00:05:10,00:05:11,Where's the head?
76,00:05:11,00:05:13,I'll find it.
77,00:05:25,00:05:26,"Hey, Nick."
78,00:05:26,00:05:28,Yeah?
79,00:05:28,00:05:30,I think I found a toupee.
80,00:05:30,00:05:32,Our vic may be bald.
81,00:05:32,00:05:38,"Thanks, that will help me distinguish it from the other severed heads I find out here."
82,00:05:46,00:05:47,Whoa.
83,00:05:51,00:05:53,What a waist.
84,00:06:30,00:06:35,"GRISSOM: David, are you getting the liver temp or performing acupuncture?"
85,00:06:35,00:06:38,"Well, his liver's not where it's supposed to be."
86,00:06:38,00:06:39,Do you think this is some kind of birth defect?
87,00:06:39,00:06:40,What do you think?
88,00:06:41,00:06:43,I think I feel fat.
89,00:06:43,00:06:44,Yes.
90,00:06:44,00:06:46,Got the liver.
91,00:06:46,00:06:49,Suicide?
92,00:06:49,00:06:53,"SIDLE: A guy loses his shirt at the tables, decides to take a permanent nap on the tracks."
93,00:06:53,00:06:55,(train whistle blows)
94,00:06:55,00:06:56,(man screams)
95,00:06:58,00:07:01,"Well, he died with his boots on."
96,00:07:04,00:07:05,SUPER: You don't have to go through the dude's mail.
97,00:07:05,00:07:07,Name's Manny Rupert.
98,00:07:07,00:07:08,He's a new tenant.
99,00:07:08,00:07:10,Paid first and last in cash.
100,00:07:10,00:07:12,We got a lot of party people around here.
101,00:07:12,00:07:16,"You know, so there's loud music every night, but this dude was pumping tunes at 7:00 in the morning."
102,00:07:17,00:07:20,"You know, I knock on the door, I go in, that's when I see the dude all laid out on the bed."
103,00:07:21,00:07:24,"Mm-hmm. Uh, figured I better step out, call in the big guns."
104,00:07:24,00:07:26,That's you.
105,00:07:26,00:07:28,"Um, listen..."
106,00:07:28,00:07:33,"if my good citizenship is not going to be appreciated here, maybe I just don't call the next one in, you know?"
107,00:07:33,00:07:34,Just stay here and shut up.
108,00:07:34,00:07:39,"I'll be back to take your prints, assuming they're not already in the system."
109,00:07:39,00:07:41,Um... okay.
110,00:07:56,00:07:59,(indistinct radio communication)
111,00:07:59,00:08:03,Which of the seven deadly sins are not represented here?
112,00:08:04,00:08:06,Petecchial hemorrhaging.
113,00:08:06,00:08:09,Could be from vomiting or asphyxiation.
114,00:08:10,00:08:12,This guy was rolling on all cylinders.
115,00:08:12,00:08:13,He was bound to throw a rod.
116,00:08:13,00:08:15,Or somebody threw it for him.
117,00:08:15,00:08:19,Pillow or a hand on the face certainly could've done the trick.
118,00:08:19,00:08:26,"ROBBINS: Well, based on the lack of rigor, T.O.D.'s three or four hours ago; tell you more after we clean him up and open him up."
119,00:08:29,00:08:31,Wallet's empty.
120,00:08:33,00:08:38,"WILLOWS: You know what they say, it's not a real party till somebody breaks something."
121,00:08:41,00:08:43,I got blood.
122,00:08:48,00:08:49,I got a noisemaker.
123,00:08:57,00:08:58,Bullet holes.
124,00:08:58,00:09:01,Somebody shot out the mirror.
125,00:09:01,00:09:03,No apparent gunshot wounds on the vic.
126,00:09:03,00:09:06,"Let's get busy, boys."
127,00:09:06,00:09:08,(train whistle blows)
128,00:09:33,00:09:35,(shutter clicks)
129,00:09:53,00:09:55,(stream flowing)
130,00:10:26,00:10:28,(shutter clicks)
131,00:11:35,00:11:37,This man's organs were displaced.
132,00:11:37,00:11:43,It's similar to the way a pregnant woman's internal organs get rearranged to compensate for her expanding uterus.
133,00:11:43,00:11:46,Some of these blisters are fresh.
134,00:11:46,00:11:50,But there's evidence of scarring and irritation going back years.
135,00:11:50,00:11:54,It all suggests a consistent long-term pressure on the waist.
136,00:12:00,00:12:03,"So what, torture or self-inflicted?"
137,00:12:03,00:12:04,I don't know.
138,00:12:04,00:12:06,"But either way, it must have been agonizing."
139,00:12:08,00:12:12,I'm beginning to sense that COD was not decapitation.
140,00:12:13,00:12:15,There's a bullet hole...
141,00:12:15,00:12:18,"COD, shot to the head with this."
142,00:12:20,00:12:22,It looks like lead.
143,00:12:22,00:12:24,.44 caliber is my guess.
144,00:12:24,00:12:26,That's a cannon.
145,00:12:28,00:12:32,"SURGEON: We managed to stop the bleeding, but his condition is critical."
146,00:12:32,00:12:34,What are the options?
147,00:12:35,00:12:37,We could try to remove the bullet.
148,00:12:37,00:12:39,What are the risks?
149,00:12:39,00:12:42,"If we go in, the vertebral artery could be impacted."
150,00:12:42,00:12:46,He could bleed out or stroke out.
151,00:12:46,00:12:49,Permanent incapacitation.
152,00:12:49,00:12:51,And without surgery?
153,00:12:51,00:12:55,"The bullet could migrate into the artery and, again, cause a stroke or kill him."
154,00:12:55,00:13:00,Or it could stay there for years and do nothing.
155,00:13:00,00:13:03,He might never wake up.
156,00:13:03,00:13:05,What are the odds?
157,00:13:05,00:13:08,"Mr. Grissom, this isn't a casino."
158,00:13:08,00:13:10,I don't give odds.
159,00:13:10,00:13:13,It's your call.
160,00:13:13,00:13:16,Do it.
161,00:13:28,00:13:31,(phone line ringing)
162,00:13:31,00:13:32,"ELLIE: Hi, it's Ellie."
163,00:13:32,00:13:33,You know the drill.
164,00:13:33,00:13:34,(beep)
165,00:13:34,00:13:38,"Ellie, this is Gil Grissom from the Las Vegas Crime Lab."
166,00:13:38,00:13:40,I'm a friend of your father's.
167,00:13:40,00:13:45,"I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but your dad's been shot."
168,00:13:45,00:13:48,And his condition is serious.
169,00:13:48,00:13:50,I think you should come and see him.
170,00:13:50,00:13:53,It would help him a lot.
171,00:13:53,00:13:57,Please call me at 702-555-0141.
172,00:14:04,00:14:09,"White residue on your vic's so-called waist was topical cortisone, prescription strength."
173,00:14:09,00:14:10,The guy had an itch.
174,00:14:10,00:14:12,He was doing more than scratching.
175,00:14:12,00:14:14,Topical doesn't get absorbed into the bloodstream.
176,00:14:14,00:14:18,But Henry says that the guy's blood was flooded with cortisone.
177,00:14:18,00:14:22,"That makes sense, as much orthopedic pain as the guy was in."
178,00:14:24,00:14:27,You checking out my waist?
179,00:14:27,00:14:29,I'm a 32-incher myself.
180,00:14:29,00:14:30,Same as in college. Oh.
181,00:14:30,00:14:32,Congratulations.
182,00:14:32,00:14:35,Women aren't the only ones who feel the pressure to look good.
183,00:14:35,00:14:39,"Time was, having a rotund belly was a sign of prosperity and success."
184,00:14:39,00:14:42,"Now it just means you're a lazy glutton, not getting any."
185,00:14:42,00:14:43,Fibers.
186,00:14:43,00:14:51,The fibers from the victim's long johns are consistent with the fibers found in the burned-up clothes.
187,00:14:51,00:14:53,STOKES: Means those were the clothes he was wearing.
188,00:14:53,00:14:55,"Raw wool, dyed grey."
189,00:14:55,00:14:56,Did you get a manufacturer?
190,00:14:56,00:14:57,No one from my database.
191,00:14:57,00:15:03,"But I did find pomegranate berry extract, used to turn wool dye in the 1800s."
192,00:15:03,00:15:05,STOKES: Insect activity all over these fibers.
193,00:15:06,00:15:07,Maybe moths or mites.
194,00:15:08,00:15:09,Check it out.
195,00:15:10,00:15:12,HODGES: Means that the fabric was old.
196,00:15:14,00:15:16,"Vintage clothing, maybe?"
197,00:15:16,00:15:18,Maybe.
198,00:15:18,00:15:19,Did you analyze the bone fragments?
199,00:15:20,00:15:21,I'm only one highly-gifted person.
200,00:15:21,00:15:22,(sighs)
201,00:15:22,00:15:23,I'll let you know.
202,00:15:23,00:15:25,You been to the hospital?
203,00:15:25,00:15:28,They're prepping him for surgery.
204,00:15:28,00:15:31,I'll keep good thoughts.
205,00:15:31,00:15:33,Mr. Party Till I Drop.
206,00:15:33,00:15:35,His blood alcohol level was .28.
207,00:15:35,00:15:36,Point two-eight?!
208,00:15:37,00:15:38,That's barely conscious for most people.
209,00:15:38,00:15:40,That's like falling-down drunk.
210,00:15:40,00:15:42,Drunk just gets you in the door.
211,00:15:42,00:15:47,"We're also talking cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamine, MDMA, THC."
212,00:15:47,00:15:51,Serum was milky white with triglycerides.
213,00:15:51,00:15:52,Wow.
214,00:15:52,00:15:55,"If it was illegal, fun or nasty, this guy was into it."
215,00:15:55,00:15:56,"Yeah, I'll say."
216,00:15:56,00:15:59,I just analyzed the secretion swabs you collected from his body.
217,00:15:59,00:16:01,Was there enough for DNA?
218,00:16:01,00:16:03,"Oh, yeah. The donor's female."
219,00:16:03,00:16:06,She's consistent with both the blood from the mirror and the pubic hair from the victim's mouth.
220,00:16:07,00:16:11,"And then I ran the profile through CODIS, and you got really lucky."
221,00:16:11,00:16:12,She's a local prostitute.
222,00:16:12,00:16:16,She's in the system for a trick roll.
223,00:16:16,00:16:20,"ROBBINS: There's evidence of sexual activity in every orifice, including his ears."
224,00:16:20,00:16:21,WILLOWS: You joking?
225,00:16:21,00:16:22,No.
226,00:16:22,00:16:26,"We've got pubic hairs, vaginal secretions."
227,00:16:26,00:16:28,Maybe he suffocated during oral sex.
228,00:16:28,00:16:30,Would you care to move on to stomach contents?
229,00:16:31,00:16:32,Guess we're done with the appetizers.
230,00:16:32,00:16:36,"Well, the main course was enough alcohol and cake to cater a wedding."
231,00:16:36,00:16:39,"Well, at least he went out in style, hmm?"
232,00:16:48,00:16:52,"ROBBINS: Alone, maybe none of it would've been fatal, but taken all together..."
233,00:16:52,00:16:54,Means he died with a smile on his face.
234,00:16:54,00:16:56,Among other things. (chuckles)
235,00:16:56,00:16:58,(door opens)
236,00:16:58,00:17:00,Hey.
237,00:17:00,00:17:01,Just came from the hospital.
238,00:17:04,00:17:06,Oh.
239,00:17:06,00:17:07,"No, no. Traffic fatality."
240,00:17:07,00:17:09,Sorry.
241,00:17:11,00:17:14,(woman speaking over intercom )
242,00:17:19,00:17:21,GRISSOM: Where's McKeen?
243,00:17:21,00:17:23,I sent him home.
244,00:17:24,00:17:26,Just kidding. He went to get something to eat.
245,00:17:28,00:17:30,Brass just went into surgery.
246,00:17:34,00:17:37,You two have known each other for a long time.
247,00:17:39,00:17:41,We've worked together ever since he came from New Jersey.
248,00:17:41,00:17:45,"Just between you and me, does he always wear a suit?"
249,00:17:45,00:17:50,"Like when you guys go to dinner, the movies or whatever it is you do when you hang out."
250,00:17:50,00:17:56,"'Cause I got to tell you, thought of him in a sweater kind of freaks me out."
251,00:17:58,00:18:01,"We don't ""hang out,"" Greg."
252,00:18:01,00:18:04,No kidding.
253,00:18:04,00:18:05,I just assumed...
254,00:18:05,00:18:07,ELLIE: What do you mean consent was given?
255,00:18:07,00:18:10,"Nobody has asked my consent to do anything, and I'm his daughter."
256,00:18:10,00:18:13,"NURSE: I understand you're upset, miss, but there's no need to take that tone."
257,00:18:13,00:18:15,"ELLIE: Look, I'm just here to see my father, okay?"
258,00:18:15,00:18:17,He's a cop.
259,00:18:17,00:18:18,He's in surgery.
260,00:18:18,00:18:22,The only thing you can do right now is take a seat and wait until he gets out.
261,00:18:22,00:18:24,"Excuse me, Ellie? What?"
262,00:18:24,00:18:25,I'm Gil Grissom.
263,00:18:25,00:18:26,Thanks for coming.
264,00:18:26,00:18:29,So I guess you're the one who's in charge.
265,00:18:31,00:18:32,How long is his surgery going to take?
266,00:18:33,00:18:34,Probably a few hours.
267,00:18:36,00:18:41,"Look, I just got off a bus, I would really like to take a shower and change and maybe get a little rest."
268,00:18:41,00:18:42,Do you have the keys to his house?
269,00:18:42,00:18:44,No.
270,00:18:44,00:18:47,"Well, you're a cop, right? How 'bout you just let me in?"
271,00:18:49,00:18:51,"You know, there's a motel just down the street."
272,00:18:51,00:18:52,I'll get you a room.
273,00:18:52,00:18:54,Do you want to check my arms?
274,00:18:54,00:18:56,Go ahead.
275,00:18:56,00:18:59,All right? It looks like Daddy already told you all about me.
276,00:18:59,00:19:01,I don't even know why I bothered to come.
277,00:19:11,00:19:12,How's it going?
278,00:19:12,00:19:13,You okay?
279,00:19:13,00:19:15,I'm okay.
280,00:19:17,00:19:19,That's a... man in a corset.
281,00:19:19,00:19:21,Corset-training.
282,00:19:21,00:19:23,A venerable practice.
283,00:19:23,00:19:25,Maybe for Scarlett O'Hara.
284,00:19:25,00:19:26,Since when was it equal opportunity?
285,00:19:26,00:19:30,"In Victorian times, it was considered a staple of masculine attire."
286,00:19:30,00:19:37,Students in British boarding schools were encouraged to lose an inch a year from the time they were 14 on.
287,00:19:37,00:19:42,I guess I should feel comforted that sadistic ideas of beauty aren't restricted to women.
288,00:19:42,00:19:44,Mm.
289,00:19:44,00:19:48,"It's called a wasp-waist, which is revealing."
290,00:19:48,00:19:52,A wasp is from the insect group hymenoptera.
291,00:19:52,00:19:55,The notion of hymen indicates virginity.
292,00:19:55,00:20:00,"In predacious wasps, the genitalia no longer functions as a reproductive organ."
293,00:20:00,00:20:01,It's used as a stinger.
294,00:20:01,00:20:04,Go in for sex and get stung.
295,00:20:04,00:20:06,Pretty much every man's fear.
296,00:20:06,00:20:08,Mm.
297,00:20:10,00:20:15,"The victim was shot, body dumped, clothes burned."
298,00:20:15,00:20:17,"The corset, too."
299,00:20:17,00:20:22,"The bone fragments that Nick found at the crime scene were whalebone, which is what they used to make corsets out of."
300,00:20:23,00:20:25,Where did you learn so much about corsets?
301,00:20:25,00:20:27,I have my sources.
302,00:20:35,00:20:38,"MAN: The embroidery is Chinese, silk."
303,00:20:38,00:20:42,The lace is made from hand-tatted linen thread.
304,00:20:42,00:20:44,Ribs are pure whalebone.
305,00:20:44,00:20:46,They don't make them like this anymore.
306,00:20:47,00:20:49,I'm sure the whales appreciate that.
307,00:20:49,00:20:52,"How many, if any, do you sell to men?"
308,00:20:52,00:20:53,More than you'd think.
309,00:20:53,00:21:02,Many men with back problems have remarked how much better a boned-tabbed Elizabethan corset feels than a steel back brace.
310,00:21:02,00:21:03,Oh.
311,00:21:03,00:21:06,Let's focus on your customers that don't have back problems.
312,00:21:06,00:21:09,"Ms. Sidle, people's private lives are their own business."
313,00:21:09,00:21:10,I don't want to...
314,00:21:11,00:21:14,"Mr. Phillipe, I have a dead man with a 19-inch waist and no way to identify him."
315,00:21:14,00:21:17,Any help at all would be appreciated.
316,00:21:17,00:21:18,Do you have a picture?
317,00:21:18,00:21:20,I have a head shot.
318,00:21:27,00:21:29,(hyperventilating)
319,00:21:29,00:21:32,"Oh, my God, that's, uh, that's Caleb Carson."
320,00:21:32,00:21:36,He comes in once a year for a re-stitch and reinforcement.
321,00:21:36,00:21:40,"Is he into pain, masochism?"
322,00:21:40,00:21:42,I don't know.
323,00:21:42,00:21:43,How about cross-dressing?
324,00:21:43,00:21:46,I seriously doubt that.
325,00:21:46,00:21:47,How come?
326,00:21:47,00:21:56,"Mr. Carson never spoke much, but he was the type of man who, when he came into the store, if I were sitting down, I'd immediately stand up."
327,00:21:56,00:21:58,He treated me like a servant.
328,00:21:58,00:22:02,"And, truth be told, he actually made me feel like one."
329,00:22:02,00:22:06,I'm going to need his address.
330,00:22:24,00:22:26,"Colonel Caleb ""C.C."" Carson."
331,00:22:26,00:22:28,1864.
332,00:22:31,00:22:32,SIDLE: Resembles the victim.
333,00:22:33,00:22:34,At least from the neck up.
334,00:22:35,00:22:38,These are Civil War-era photos.
335,00:22:38,00:22:42,CURTIS: They didn't smile much back then.
336,00:22:42,00:22:45,Subjects had to hold completely still for five minutes.
337,00:22:45,00:22:47,"Otherwise, the exposure would blur."
338,00:22:47,00:22:49,It hurt to hold a smile.
339,00:22:50,00:22:52,Bet these hurt more.
340,00:22:56,00:22:59,It's the same caliber killed the vic.
341,00:22:59,00:23:01,They don't make 'em like they used to.
342,00:23:07,00:23:09,"(""Dixie"" and gunfire play on recording )"
343,00:23:32,00:23:34,Warrick just called from the hospital.
344,00:23:34,00:23:36,They got the bullet.
345,00:23:36,00:23:39,How's he doing?
346,00:23:39,00:23:41,He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
347,00:23:44,00:23:47,This fellow seems to have lost his way.
348,00:23:47,00:23:51,Is this Gettysburg?
349,00:23:51,00:23:53,You into military history?
350,00:23:53,00:23:54,My dad was.
351,00:23:54,00:23:59,"Used to spend the summer touring Pennsylvania in an RV, so I could learn things."
352,00:23:59,00:24:01,You were a lucky girl.
353,00:24:03,00:24:06,"Pickett's Charge, I think."
354,00:24:06,00:24:10,The Confederates advanced from this position to Cemetery Ridge.
355,00:24:10,00:24:14,"They marched to their doom, but kept their honor."
356,00:24:14,00:24:18,Carson obviously was a Son of the South.
357,00:24:25,00:24:27,Looks comfortable.
358,00:24:27,00:24:32,"GRISSOM: Well, he was into discipline and self-denial."
359,00:24:32,00:24:34,"This corset ties from the back, which means Mr."
360,00:24:35,00:24:37,Carson couldn't have tied the laces by himself.
361,00:24:37,00:24:39,He had to have help.
362,00:24:53,00:24:56,Seems to run in the family.
363,00:25:03,00:25:04,"Oh, I don't really know. I..."
364,00:25:05,00:25:06,You know what?
365,00:25:06,00:25:07,Let me call you back.
366,00:25:07,00:25:08,Ellie?
367,00:25:09,00:25:12,Hey.
368,00:25:12,00:25:13,You know your father's out of surgery.
369,00:25:13,00:25:14,Yeah. How's he doing?
370,00:25:14,00:25:19,"It's a little too early to tell, but I know when he wakes up, he'll be happy to see you."
371,00:25:19,00:25:21,You think so?
372,00:25:21,00:25:23,I know so. You look good.
373,00:25:23,00:25:26,"Yeah, you mean, I don't look like a crack whore anymore?"
374,00:25:26,00:25:28,"That's not what I meant, but no."
375,00:25:30,00:25:33,Does he ever talk about me?
376,00:25:35,00:25:37,That's a no.
377,00:25:37,00:25:40,"Look, what do you want me to say, hmm?"
378,00:25:40,00:25:43,"It's not really about you right now, okay?"
379,00:25:43,00:25:46,But the fact that you're here is saying a lot.
380,00:25:48,00:25:51,"Yeah, well, thanks for clearing that up for me."
381,00:25:58,00:26:01,Remember that trick roll that you pled out last year?
382,00:26:01,00:26:03,I have no idea what you're talking about.
383,00:26:03,00:26:06,Your DNA in our database says that you do.
384,00:26:06,00:26:10,"We found your blood in Manny Rupert's apartment, with him lying there dead."
385,00:26:12,00:26:16,"If you Belushi'd the guy, maybe you didn't mean to."
386,00:26:17,00:26:19,Now would be the time to say it.
387,00:26:19,00:26:20,"Look, I'm the victim here."
388,00:26:21,00:26:22,"Funny, you don't look dead."
389,00:26:22,00:26:25,(heavy sigh)
390,00:26:25,00:26:27,"Look, the whole night started out normal, okay?"
391,00:26:27,00:26:29,"I mean, he paid for everything."
392,00:26:29,00:26:30,He was kind of fun.
393,00:26:30,00:26:33,(cork popping) And he was up for anything.
394,00:26:33,00:26:36,"I mean, there was champagne, E, coke, cake."
395,00:26:36,00:26:39,And he wasn't even bad-looking.
396,00:26:39,00:26:42,"So, how did it go so bad?"
397,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Well, usually, a guy is good for maybe one or two."
398,00:26:45,00:26:48,"This guy wanted more after six, if you know what I mean."
399,00:26:48,00:26:52,"No ""off"" switch? No, not even close."
400,00:26:52,00:26:55,"It's getting kind of late. No, look, you're not... you're not going anywhere!"
401,00:26:55,00:26:57,"Okay, honey, you need to get some rest."
402,00:26:57,00:26:59,No. I paid for the whole night!
403,00:26:59,00:27:00,"(gunshots, screaming)"
404,00:27:00,00:27:02,Son of a... Ow. Ouch. Ow.
405,00:27:02,00:27:05,"He was whacked out, but he was alive when I bolted."
406,00:27:05,00:27:11,"Well, that's a great story, but it doesn't sound like it was worth the ten G's that we found in your purse."
407,00:27:11,00:27:12,I earned that money.
408,00:27:13,00:27:17,"Don't take it personally, but you are not a $10,000-a-night girl."
409,00:27:19,00:27:23,Are you finished processing those prints from Manny Rupert's apartment?
410,00:27:23,00:27:24,Does it look like I have?
411,00:27:24,00:27:26,"So far, the decedent's prints are everywhere."
412,00:27:26,00:27:31,"Got them on liquor bottles, drug paraphernalia, the gun, the dishes."
413,00:27:31,00:27:33,Are you looking for something in particular?
414,00:27:33,00:27:36,We're looking for anything the hooker might have touched.
415,00:27:36,00:27:40,We're thinking she might have slipped him something that pushed him over the edge.
416,00:27:40,00:27:41,Uh...
417,00:27:41,00:27:44,"I got her prints off of the bedpost, the chair, and a soda can."
418,00:27:44,00:27:47,She didn't touch the booze or pills.
419,00:27:47,00:27:49,Maybe she's in AA.
420,00:27:49,00:27:50,Hmm.
421,00:27:50,00:27:53,Maybe she's not a killer.
422,00:27:53,00:27:56,I just can't believe it.
423,00:27:56,00:28:00,I've been with Mr. Carson for years.
424,00:28:00,00:28:02,How do you mean?
425,00:28:02,00:28:03,Nothing like that.
426,00:28:03,00:28:05,I was his driver.
427,00:28:05,00:28:08,I take it you got my fingerprints from my work card?
428,00:28:08,00:28:09,That's right.
429,00:28:10,00:28:12,They were on one of Mr. Carson's corsets.
430,00:28:12,00:28:15,I was also Mr. Carson's dresser.
431,00:28:15,00:28:16,What did that entail?
432,00:28:16,00:28:22,"In the 19th century, a dresser's job was to help gentleman soldiers with their equipment."
433,00:28:22,00:28:25,So you dressed him in Rebel drag.
434,00:28:25,00:28:30,"If you're asking, did I lace his corset, of course."
435,00:28:30,00:28:32,Every morning.
436,00:28:32,00:28:34,Did it hurt?
437,00:28:34,00:28:36,Absolutely.
438,00:28:36,00:28:38,But he controlled the pain.
439,00:28:38,00:28:42,When was the last time you saw him?
440,00:28:42,00:28:44,Yesterday morning.
441,00:28:44,00:28:45,At the house.
442,00:28:45,00:28:46,No.
443,00:28:46,00:28:49,At a duel.
444,00:28:49,00:28:51,A duel?
445,00:28:51,00:28:52,Where?
446,00:28:52,00:28:55,Gettysburg.
447,00:28:58,00:29:00,(gunfire)
448,00:29:00,00:29:02,(cannon fire)
449,00:29:02,00:29:04,(screaming)
450,00:29:04,00:29:05,(indistinct shouting)
451,00:29:09,00:29:12,(men shouting)
452,00:29:13,00:29:18,"If all you do is Civil War recreations, why were you and Caleb Carson having a duel?"
453,00:29:18,00:29:21,"Ugh! Apparently, I offended him."
454,00:29:21,00:29:24,"Honey, I'm right in the middle of Cemetery Ridge here."
455,00:29:24,00:29:26,I care what we have for dinner.
456,00:29:26,00:29:27,"Well, check the cupboards..."
457,00:29:27,00:29:28,Sir! (grunts)
458,00:29:28,00:29:30,You dishonor the dead.
459,00:29:30,00:29:33,"Damn it, Caleb, that was my wife I was talking to."
460,00:29:33,00:29:36,My great-great grandfather spilled blood on this hallowed ground.
461,00:29:36,00:29:37,"Oh, really?"
462,00:29:37,00:29:39,I didn't know Gettysburg was in Nevada.
463,00:29:39,00:29:41,I demand satisfaction.
464,00:29:42,00:29:45,"I challenge you to a duel, sir!"
465,00:29:45,00:29:47,(heavy sigh)
466,00:29:48,00:29:51,Okay. Fine.
467,00:29:51,00:29:52,Let's do it.
468,00:29:53,00:29:58,"I'd never reenacted a duel, so, uh, we agreed to meet on the field of honor with our pistols."
469,00:29:58,00:29:59,And real bullets?
470,00:29:59,00:30:00,"No, no, not in my gun."
471,00:30:00,00:30:05,"No, I figured we were just going to blast some powder and then go out for pancakes."
472,00:30:05,00:30:08,Caleb wanted a little more authenticity.
473,00:30:08,00:30:10,Guns at the ready and...
474,00:30:10,00:30:17,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
475,00:30:18,00:30:19,(screams)
476,00:30:19,00:30:20,(men shouting in distance)
477,00:30:20,00:30:22,"But this isn't a recreation, you know."
478,00:30:22,00:30:23,He really shot me.
479,00:30:24,00:30:25,Almost nicked the bone.
480,00:30:25,00:30:27,It's a good thing my second was there.
481,00:30:28,00:30:30,He's a male nurse.
482,00:30:31,00:30:36,"CURTIS: A man shoots you, and you don't call the police?"
483,00:30:37,00:30:39,He shot me 'cause I was taking a cell phone call.
484,00:30:39,00:30:42,What do you think he was going to do if went to the cops?
485,00:30:42,00:30:45,"When that bullet hit me, I ran for my life."
486,00:30:45,00:30:47,I jumped in my car and got the heck out of here.
487,00:30:47,00:30:49,What about him?
488,00:30:49,00:30:51,"Oh, we-we carpool."
489,00:30:53,00:30:55,Colt .44?
490,00:30:55,00:30:57,Yeah.
491,00:30:57,00:30:58,Is that your dueling pistol?
492,00:31:00,00:31:01,We're going to have to take that with us.
493,00:31:01,00:31:03,Why?
494,00:31:03,00:31:06,"I, too, demand satisfaction."
495,00:31:06,00:31:08,(men shouting)
496,00:31:12,00:31:13,Ready?
497,00:31:13,00:31:15,Ready.
498,00:31:15,00:31:24,"BOTH: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
499,00:31:24,00:31:28,(camera shutters clicking)
500,00:31:32,00:31:33,I got blood drops.
501,00:31:33,00:31:35,Heading way from Mr. Carson.
502,00:31:35,00:31:38,Consistent with the duelist's story.
503,00:31:38,00:31:39,(screams)
504,00:31:41,00:31:44,(camera shutter clicking)
505,00:31:44,00:31:46,"I got something here, too."
506,00:31:46,00:31:51,This could be the blood that we didn't find at the train tracks-- It's a lot of blood.
507,00:31:51,00:31:53,(camera shutter clicking)
508,00:31:53,00:31:54,Maybe Carson was killed here.
509,00:32:02,00:32:04,(muffled voices on intercom )
510,00:32:07,00:32:08,"Yeah, she's here."
511,00:32:08,00:32:12,Been drinking a ton of coffee and going outside for smokes; on her cell.
512,00:32:13,00:32:15,"Not real sociable, you know?"
513,00:32:15,00:32:17,You want me to keep an eye on her?
514,00:32:17,00:32:19,GRISSOM: It sounds like you already are.
515,00:32:19,00:32:21,Nah. I'm off the clock.
516,00:32:21,00:32:24,"I'll stick around for awhile, let you know if there's any change."
517,00:32:24,00:32:26,"Thank you, Nick."
518,00:32:26,00:32:29,Did you compare the bullet from the victim to this pistol?
519,00:32:29,00:32:33,"Uh, no, not yet, but, boss, I don't think that's your murder weapon."
520,00:32:33,00:32:35,And you know this how?
521,00:32:35,00:32:37,"Uh, here, I'll let Hawkeye show you."
522,00:32:45,00:32:46,What is that?
523,00:32:46,00:32:51,"DAWSON: Well, Hodges will have to confirm, but I'm pretty certain it's cream of wheat."
524,00:32:53,00:32:55,So he's a cereal killer.
525,00:32:55,00:32:57,"Snap, crackle and pop."
526,00:32:57,00:33:05,"Uh, the dried powdered wheat particles actually augments the smoke, and, uh, seals the gunpowder in the cylinder."
527,00:33:05,00:33:08,Which would be perfect for Civil War reenactments.
528,00:33:08,00:33:15,Yeah. I don't think that Colt's fired a real bullet in quite a while.
529,00:33:20,00:33:26,"BROWN: Miss Rupert, as far as we can tell, your brother died from diabetic shock."
530,00:33:26,00:33:28,What? How?
531,00:33:28,00:33:31,"Well, it seems that he went on a bender."
532,00:33:31,00:33:36,"He consumed a great deal of alcohol, sugar and narcotics."
533,00:33:36,00:33:38,Did he party like this a lot?
534,00:33:38,00:33:40,No. No.
535,00:33:40,00:33:43,He was just diagnosed as pre-diabetic.
536,00:33:43,00:33:46,So he was aware of his condition.
537,00:33:46,00:33:48,Yeah.
538,00:33:48,00:33:51,Do you like that this was self-induced?
539,00:33:51,00:33:53,(sighs)
540,00:33:53,00:33:56,"You know, our family has a history of heart disease and diabetes."
541,00:33:57,00:33:59,Both our parents died of heart attacks in their 40s.
542,00:34:00,00:34:01,"Two of our grandparents, too."
543,00:34:01,00:34:05,"Well, Manny turned 40 last week and he acted like it was a death sentence."
544,00:34:05,00:34:13,"You know, but he... he always said, ""You can't fight bad genes."" You know, he had a vasectomy when he was 22."
545,00:34:13,00:34:17,"Never got married, just didn't see the point."
546,00:34:17,00:34:19,So he just... gave up?
547,00:34:19,00:34:21,He quit?
548,00:34:21,00:34:26,You don't know what it's like to live with a death sentence hanging over your head.
549,00:34:26,00:34:30,"No. You're right, I don't."
550,00:34:31,00:34:32,No.
551,00:34:33,00:34:35,But I've seen what it's like to not have a choice.
552,00:34:35,00:34:37,And he did.
553,00:34:37,00:34:40,"He could have fought it, but he just chose not to."
554,00:34:40,00:34:44,"You know, I just lost my brother, and you're judging him?"
555,00:34:44,00:34:48,How dare you.
556,00:34:48,00:34:51,I'm-I'm so very sorry for your loss.
557,00:35:02,00:35:04,Am I interrupting?
558,00:35:04,00:35:06,No.
559,00:35:06,00:35:09,I just got a heads up from a friend in payroll at PERS.
560,00:35:10,00:35:13,Ellie Brass just called about Jim's pension.
561,00:35:13,00:35:17,She wanted to know how much there was and was she a beneficiary.
562,00:35:17,00:35:20,This girl is circling like a vulture.
563,00:35:20,00:35:24,Jim doesn't need this kind of energy around him now.
564,00:35:24,00:35:29,Now... Ellie's been in a lot of trouble with the law.
565,00:35:29,00:35:32,It wouldn't be difficult to chase her out of town.
566,00:35:32,00:35:39,"Well, I'm sure he'd appreciate the offer, but I don't think he'd want you to do that."
567,00:35:39,00:35:41,Excuse me.
568,00:35:41,00:35:52,"I got the DNA results for your decapitated Civil War corset victim, and the blood from the field is a match to Carson, but the epithelials on the toupee from the train tracks are not."
569,00:35:52,00:35:55,"So, were any of your suspects wearing a rug?"
570,00:35:57,00:35:59,I can think of one.
571,00:35:59,00:36:02,Please be careful.
572,00:36:02,00:36:03,That's a very expensive piece.
573,00:36:03,00:36:06,I don't understand why I'm here again.
574,00:36:06,00:36:08,It's not a crime to lose your hair.
575,00:36:08,00:36:11,Depends on where you lose it.
576,00:36:11,00:36:17,"SIDLE: If it's on the train tracks near a decapitated body with the victim's blood on it, it's usually a crime."
577,00:36:17,00:36:21,"Mr. Kimble, would you like to revise your prior statement?"
578,00:36:21,00:36:25,Or would you prefer to wait in a cell while we match toupees?
579,00:36:28,00:36:31,It was an accident.
580,00:36:31,00:36:33,Which part?
581,00:36:33,00:36:36,I suppose mostly the part when I shot him.
582,00:36:38,00:36:40,I could see the insanity in his eyes.
583,00:36:40,00:36:43,"(gunfire, yelling)"
584,00:36:43,00:36:45,"Mr. Carson, you shot him!"
585,00:36:45,00:36:47,You really shot him! And I intend to kill him.
586,00:36:47,00:36:49,Get out of my way!
587,00:36:49,00:36:50,KIMBLE: Please!
588,00:36:50,00:36:52,(gunshot)
589,00:36:54,00:36:58,He was really going to kill that man.
590,00:36:58,00:37:01,"If it was an accident, you should have called 911."
591,00:37:01,00:37:04,I couldn't let him be found like that.
592,00:37:05,00:37:07,His corseting was private.
593,00:37:07,00:37:12,"You're right, it's much better to have his body found stripped and dumped on some train tracks."
594,00:37:12,00:37:17,His great-great-great grandfather died trying to stop a Yankee train from entering Virginia.
595,00:37:17,00:37:22,Legend has it he stood square on the tracks firing at the engineer until the train ran him down.
596,00:37:22,00:37:26,Mr. Carson spoke of it frequently.
597,00:37:26,00:37:28,He said it was an honorable death.
598,00:37:30,00:37:35,I was just trying to give him the same.
599,00:37:35,00:37:38,"All right, look, are you guys arresting me or what?"
600,00:37:38,00:37:40,"Hey, don't get in my face."
601,00:37:40,00:37:42,All he told me was bring you here.
602,00:37:44,00:37:47,Hi. Come in.
603,00:37:54,00:37:56,This is your dad's office.
604,00:37:56,00:37:58,"Yeah, I can read."
605,00:37:58,00:38:01,Have a seat.
606,00:38:01,00:38:03,Why?
607,00:38:03,00:38:06,Why not?
608,00:38:28,00:38:31,(chuckles)
609,00:38:40,00:38:42,That's the reason we asked you to come in.
610,00:38:42,00:38:46,That's like loving a puppy. That's easy.
611,00:38:46,00:38:54,"You know, did you ever think that maybe he's better off just lying there and not waking up?"
612,00:38:54,00:38:56,A lot easier.
613,00:38:57,00:39:02,"DOCTOR: Every patient is different, but for now, no change is good news."
614,00:39:02,00:39:04,(cell phone ringing)
615,00:39:04,00:39:06,Excuse me.
616,00:39:06,00:39:08,"Hi, Lindsey."
617,00:39:08,00:39:13,"I know, I told you that I might be a little while."
618,00:39:13,00:39:16,"No, I said that we couldtryand see a movie."
619,00:39:16,00:39:17,"Hey, you know what?"
620,00:39:17,00:39:20,I've got a friend here who is fighting for his life.
621,00:39:20,00:39:22,I would appreciate a little understanding.
622,00:39:22,00:39:24,I will talk about this with you later. Good-bye.
623,00:39:25,00:39:27,How old?
624,00:39:27,00:39:28,Fourteen.
625,00:39:28,00:39:30,Supposedly.
626,00:39:30,00:39:32,I got one of those in high school myself.
627,00:39:32,00:39:35,World's pretty small at that age.
628,00:39:35,00:39:37,"It feels pretty small to me right now, too."
629,00:39:38,00:39:39,WOMAN (over P.A.): Code Blue alert.
630,00:39:41,00:39:45,(monitor beeping rapidly)
631,00:40:13,00:40:16,(beeping slows and stabilizes)
632,00:40:44,00:40:47,(monitor beeping steadily)
633,00:41:03,00:41:04,(weakly): Hey.
634,00:41:04,00:41:06,Hey.
635,00:41:06,00:41:08,Have some water.
636,00:41:15,00:41:18,Thanks for not pulling the plug.
637,00:41:18,00:41:21,"Your, uh, fan club is here."
638,00:41:39,00:41:41,(sighs)
639,00:41:47,00:41:49,I don't know.
640,00:41:49,00:41:52,"Most people want to die in their sleep, I suppose."
641,00:41:52,00:41:54,Never know that it's happening.
642,00:41:54,00:41:56,Like a crime scene.
643,00:41:57,00:41:59,"Surprise, you're dead."
644,00:41:59,00:42:04,I'd prefer to know in advance that I was going to die.
645,00:42:04,00:42:08,"I'd like to be diagnosed with cancer, actually."
646,00:42:09,00:42:11,Have some time to prepare.
647,00:42:11,00:42:13,(sighs)
648,00:42:13,00:42:17,Go back to the rain forest one more time.
649,00:42:17,00:42:18,RereadMoby Dick.
650,00:42:20,00:42:23,Possibly enter an international chess tournament.
651,00:42:24,00:42:28,At least have enough time to say good-bye to the people I love.
652,00:42:32,00:42:36,I'm not ready to say good-bye.
