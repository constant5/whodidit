10,00:01:55,00:01:56,(slurring): See this car over here?
11,00:01:56,00:01:58,This is m-my car.
12,00:01:58,00:02:01,And I-I thought... that was...

15,00:03:15,00:03:19,LANGSTON: Wealthy art dealer comes out for a late-night swim.
16,00:03:19,00:03:22,Somebody's there who shouldn't be.
17,00:03:22,00:03:23,(groans)
18,00:03:25,00:03:27,That is a whole lot of face smashing.
19,00:03:27,00:03:30,You think it was a crime of passion?
20,00:03:30,00:03:32,That is what it takes to make great art.
21,00:03:40,00:03:43,Can you think of anybody who wanted to hurt your fiancÃ©?
22,00:03:43,00:03:46,Carsten was an art dealer.
23,00:03:46,00:03:52,"He dedicated his life to bringing beauty into the world, inspiring people."
24,00:03:52,00:03:54,Everybody loved him.
25,00:03:54,00:03:59,"$5 million property, 50-cent lock."
26,00:03:59,00:04:02,Easy access for anyone who wanted to get in.
27,00:04:02,00:04:05,"Thank you for helping out today, Wendy."
28,00:04:05,00:04:06,"Oh, I'm happy to."
29,00:04:06,00:04:07,We had a lot of bodies today.
30,00:04:07,00:04:11,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not happy that we had a lot of bodies today."
31,00:04:15,00:04:16,There's a blood trail here.
32,00:04:18,00:04:21,I have absolutely no idea how I could have missed that.
33,00:04:23,00:04:26,SIMMS: Right here...
34,00:04:26,00:04:28,and here.
35,00:04:28,00:04:30,And here.
36,00:04:34,00:04:36,Aha! It was him!
37,00:04:36,00:04:39,I didn't think I missed it.
38,00:04:39,00:04:41,Hi.
39,00:04:41,00:04:48,"Hi... ""Gareth."" He must have snuck in while I was processing the pool."
40,00:04:48,00:04:51,"Well, it's actually his house."
41,00:04:51,00:04:53,When was the last time you saw Carsten?
42,00:04:53,00:04:57,"Um... after everybody left, he went outside to have a relaxing swim to calm down."
43,00:04:57,00:04:59,Why did he need to calm down?
44,00:04:59,00:05:01,I'm not really sure.
45,00:05:01,00:05:07,"Uh, but during the party, I saw him go into his office with a client I hadn't seen before."
46,00:05:07,00:05:09,The next thing I know...
47,00:05:09,00:05:12,"I want everybody out of here! Out, out, out!"
48,00:05:12,00:05:14,Party's over!
49,00:05:14,00:05:16,Carsten was so upset.
50,00:05:16,00:05:21,"But he wouldn't tell me what happened, so I went to bed alone."
51,00:05:21,00:05:28,"The next thing, it was morning and the pool guy was shouting to call the police."
52,00:05:28,00:05:30,LANGSTON: The office should be right up ahead.
53,00:05:30,00:05:33,Is Brass getting the surveillance?
54,00:05:33,00:05:39,"Yes, but there doesn't appear to be any camera with a clear view of the pool."
55,00:05:39,00:05:41,"Well, I doubt Hef has them in the grotto either."
56,00:05:41,00:05:44,(indistinct radio transmission)
57,00:05:46,00:05:48,LANGSTON: Obvious signs of a struggle.
58,00:05:48,00:05:51,I'll swab the usual places for touch DNA.
59,00:05:55,00:05:56,(camera shutter clicking)
60,00:06:10,00:06:16,These are Mesopotamian vases circa 700 B.C.E.
61,00:06:16,00:06:18,These should be in a museum.
62,00:06:18,00:06:20,"Yes, they're trophies."
63,00:06:20,00:06:24,Collecting's pathological whether you're a rich man or a serial killer.
64,00:06:26,00:06:28,"Oh, hey, no, Gareth!"
65,00:06:28,00:06:30,"No, no, no, no!"
66,00:06:30,00:06:31,Don't lick the evidence.
67,00:06:31,00:06:34,Shh-shh! Go! Go! Go!
68,00:06:34,00:06:36,And I thought dogs would eat anything.
69,00:06:36,00:06:41,LANGSTON: This is the video surveillance from Carsten Pennington's party.
70,00:06:41,00:06:46,This all seems consistent with what Carsten's fiancÃ©e told Brass.
71,00:06:46,00:06:48,Do we have any idea what prompted his outburst?
72,00:06:48,00:06:52,"I don't know what, but..."
73,00:06:52,00:06:53,"(typing, computer trilling)"
74,00:06:53,00:06:55,...maybe who.
75,00:06:55,00:07:02,"See, the vic was alone in his office with that guy for approximately seven minutes before buzzkill."
76,00:07:02,00:07:06,"So, now all we need to do is figure out who that guy is."
77,00:07:06,00:07:09,Yeah. Let me see what I can do.
78,00:07:09,00:07:10,(typing)
79,00:07:10,00:07:12,All right.
80,00:07:16,00:07:18,(clears throat)
81,00:07:19,00:07:21,Are you trying to do my job?
82,00:07:21,00:07:24,"Eh... yes, a little."
83,00:07:24,00:07:28,"Mandy had dusted everything for fingerprints, and unfortunately, she came up empty."
84,00:07:28,00:07:29,But look at this.
85,00:07:29,00:07:38,"I think that these fragments, the ones that Gareth found so delicious, I think that they used to be a vase that was actually stolen from the Iraqi National Museum."
86,00:07:38,00:07:47,"I think it was smuggled in, like drug-dealer style because basically, all you have to do is take an antique vase, and you wrap it up in a bunch of cellophane, right?"
87,00:07:47,00:07:58,"You fill it with some little plastic doodads and candy and slap a ""Made in China"" sticker on there, and that priceless piece of art can just sail though US Customs like a Tijuana piÃ±ata. (phone chirps)"
88,00:07:58,00:07:59,Excuse me.
89,00:07:59,00:08:01,(groans)
90,00:08:01,00:08:03,I hate actors.
91,00:08:03,00:08:08,"Okay, I have to go, but I would love to finish putting that back together when I'm done, if it's okay with you."
92,00:08:08,00:08:10,Mm-hmm. I love jigsaw puzzles.
93,00:08:43,00:08:45,(computer trilling)
94,00:08:56,00:08:58,"(computer trilling, beeping)"
95,00:09:09,00:09:11,BRASS: So when was the last time you saw Mr. Pennington?
96,00:09:11,00:09:12,"Uh, the other night at his party."
97,00:09:13,00:09:18,I've been acquiring Mesopotamian antiquities on behalf of the Marrakesh for an exhibit at our casino museum.
98,00:09:19,00:09:21,I purchased a piece from Mr. Pennington last month.
99,00:09:21,00:09:26,"He called me and said he had a new Babylonian piece for sale, so I went to go see it."
100,00:09:26,00:09:28,It wasn't what I was looking for.
101,00:09:28,00:09:30,"Why, because it was stolen?"
102,00:09:30,00:09:33,Like from the National Museum of Iraq?
103,00:09:33,00:09:34,Before...
104,00:09:34,00:09:37,after.
105,00:09:37,00:09:42,"Trafficking in stolen antiquities is illegal, and from what I hear, dangerous."
106,00:09:42,00:09:44,Which is why people get off on it.
107,00:09:44,00:09:46,Not me. Do you know who I work for?
108,00:09:46,00:09:47,"Yeah, Bruce Curtis, CEO of Marrakesh Corporation."
109,00:09:47,00:09:49,I've met him.
110,00:09:49,00:09:53,Then you know if he found out I compromised his reputation with something like this...
111,00:09:53,00:09:54,You'd be ancient history.
112,00:09:54,00:09:58,"Look, I don't know who killed Mr. Pennington, but it wasn't me."
113,00:09:58,00:10:03,"And if he was dealing with the black market, then maybe he got what was coming to him."
114,00:10:03,00:10:06,SIMMS: Stupid lousy jigsaw puzzle.
115,00:10:06,00:10:10,It's one stupid piece.
116,00:10:12,00:10:14,"You looking for this, Wendy?"
117,00:10:14,00:10:17,Yes.
118,00:10:17,00:10:19,Thank you.
119,00:10:27,00:10:29,Hmm.
120,00:10:29,00:10:31,It's done.
121,00:10:31,00:10:32,It's fake.
122,00:10:32,00:10:33,How do you know?
123,00:10:33,00:10:34,The cat told me.
124,00:10:36,00:10:40,"LANGSTON: You take a replica vase, you smear it with yogurt, you let it soak in."
125,00:10:40,00:10:44,Then you mix in minerals from the geographic area you're trying to fake.
126,00:10:44,00:10:47,"You let it sit in a hot, dry place."
127,00:10:47,00:10:50,You let theLactococcus lactis go to work...
128,00:10:50,00:10:59,"This process visibly ages the piece and creates a true mineral match, which, according to my research, can fool experts and spectrographic analysis alike."
129,00:10:59,00:11:01,But not a hungry cat?
130,00:11:01,00:11:06,I have a man in Dubai whose brother is a curator.
131,00:11:06,00:11:11,LANGSTON: The casino guy realized he'd been conned and was terrified his boss would find out.
132,00:11:14,00:11:15,What have you done?
133,00:11:15,00:11:17,"Nothing, compared to what I'm going to do to you."
134,00:11:17,00:11:19,I want my money back!
135,00:11:19,00:11:23,He was a lot more cooperative as a victim of art fraud than he is as a suspect.
136,00:11:23,00:11:25,Killing Carsten wouldn't get his boss's money back.
137,00:11:26,00:11:27,"No, so I checked Pennington's bank."
138,00:11:27,00:11:30,"He withdrew over $100,000 the day before he died."
139,00:11:30,00:11:32,Sounds like Carsten was about to skip town.
140,00:11:32,00:11:34,That's funny his fiancÃ©e didn't mention that.
141,00:11:34,00:11:36,"So, what's this about?"
142,00:11:36,00:11:40,"Ms. Farrell, were you aware that Mr. Pennington withdrew over $100,000 from his bank accounts yesterday?"
143,00:11:41,00:11:43,Um... why?
144,00:11:44,00:11:46,"Uh, no, I didn't know anything about that."
145,00:11:46,00:11:48,Then this'll be a short visit.
146,00:12:23,00:12:28,I found blood stains on Ms. Farrell's party dress. Oh.
147,00:12:28,00:12:29,It's been washed.
148,00:12:29,00:12:32,I look great in that dress.
149,00:12:32,00:12:36,"I wanted to wear it out tonight, so I had to clean it-- it was dirty."
150,00:12:36,00:12:39,Those incriminating DNA stains can be so hard to get out.
151,00:12:40,00:12:44,Which is why professional criminals prefer chlorine bleach.
152,00:12:44,00:12:47,You use a nonenzymatic detergent.
153,00:12:47,00:12:50,Good for the environment... and DNA retrieval.
154,00:12:50,00:12:53,I want an attorney.
155,00:12:53,00:12:54,"Sure, that's your right."
156,00:12:55,00:12:56,This is how I clean up the planet.
157,00:12:56,00:12:58,(handcuffs clicking)
158,00:13:03,00:13:06,So you think she just didn't know that her fiancÃ© was an art faker?
159,00:13:06,00:13:11,She was living in a swanky house having swell parties and holding court with fine friends.
160,00:13:12,00:13:13,I don't think she really cared.
161,00:13:13,00:13:15,"Nice work, Doctor."
162,00:13:15,00:13:17,"Nice work to you, too, Simms."
163,00:13:17,00:13:18,Thank you.
164,00:13:18,00:13:19,"Ray, excuse me."
165,00:13:19,00:13:21,Could you come in here for a minute?
166,00:13:21,00:13:22,You need to see this.
167,00:13:25,00:13:30,It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.
168,00:13:30,00:13:33,"That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington."
169,00:13:33,00:13:36,It is.
170,00:13:36,00:13:37,And it isn't.
171,00:14:03,00:14:05,Second stage instar.
172,00:14:05,00:14:09,"And since liver is fixed, she's been dead no more than 48 hours."
173,00:14:09,00:14:14,"SANDERS: So, Jena Makin from Hollywood might have died on her 31st birthday."
174,00:14:15,00:14:17,No cell phone.
175,00:14:17,00:14:20,"But if she has a number, we'll get the records from the carrier."
176,00:14:20,00:14:25,Bullets entered under the chin and exited the top of the skull.
177,00:14:25,00:14:29,WILLOWS: Blood spatter and two holes in the ceiling.
178,00:14:29,00:14:33,Suggests that she was sitting up when she was shot.
179,00:14:33,00:14:34,(sobbing): Please... (gun hammer cocks)
180,00:14:34,00:14:37,(two gunshots)
181,00:14:42,00:14:45,Bullets look like .38s.
182,00:14:45,00:14:47,Probably a revolver.
183,00:14:47,00:14:48,No casings.
184,00:14:54,00:14:57,And they're oxidized.
185,00:14:57,00:15:00,Our killer doesn't know how to store ammunition.
186,00:15:01,00:15:03,Though it looks like he knows how to cover his tracks.
187,00:15:03,00:15:09,"Got a couple possible wine glass stains here, but I don't remember seeing any wine or glasses in the room."
188,00:15:14,00:15:15,Strange-looking void.
189,00:15:23,00:15:24,(gasps)
190,00:15:24,00:15:25,(chuckles)
191,00:15:25,00:15:28,Hello.
192,00:15:28,00:15:29,What is it?
193,00:15:35,00:15:37,A witness.
194,00:15:46,00:15:48,"(groans softly): Oh, God."
195,00:15:52,00:15:55,COD's no mystery-- two GSWs to the head.
196,00:15:55,00:15:59,But I did find some abrasions in the vaginal vault.
197,00:15:59,00:16:00,Could indicate rape.
198,00:16:01,00:16:03,Or rough consensual sex.
199,00:16:03,00:16:06,"Either way, the, uh, wet mount was negative for semen."
200,00:16:06,00:16:08,How considerate.
201,00:16:08,00:16:09,He wore a condom.
202,00:16:11,00:16:13,Busy night.
203,00:16:18,00:16:22,"Well, the blood void means that the tortoise was there during the shooting."
204,00:16:22,00:16:26,And this print has got to belong to the killer.
205,00:16:29,00:16:30,"WILLOWS: Mandy, what are you thinking?"
206,00:16:30,00:16:32,The ASPCA is gonna shut us down.
207,00:16:32,00:16:35,Mandy?
208,00:16:35,00:16:37,The Amido black.
209,00:16:37,00:16:38,It's minimally toxic; it won't hurt him.
210,00:16:39,00:16:40,I'll be gentle.
211,00:16:41,00:16:44,HODGES: Wonder if he's a rare species.
212,00:16:44,00:16:47,"'Cause I read that African tortoises can be worth as much as $10,000."
213,00:16:47,00:16:48,"Just please hurry, okay?"
214,00:16:48,00:16:51,'Cause he's been traumatized enough already.
215,00:16:51,00:16:54,He's a material witness in a homicide investigation.
216,00:16:54,00:16:55,I meant traumatized by you.
217,00:16:58,00:17:01,So who brings a tortoise to a gunfight?
218,00:17:01,00:17:06,"If the killer was trying to take it with him after he killed the girl, then it stands to reason that the killer brought it in the first place."
219,00:17:06,00:17:09,"Or maybe it was hers, which is why he killed her."
220,00:17:09,00:17:10,You just said they're valuable.
221,00:17:10,00:17:12,I got a hit.
222,00:17:12,00:17:13,"Uh, Mickey Ross."
223,00:17:13,00:17:15,TheMickey Ross?
224,00:17:15,00:17:18,Who's Mickey Ross?
225,00:17:18,00:17:22,Mickey Ross is only the star of theCrimson Orchid film franchise.
226,00:17:22,00:17:26,"Ross plays Dr. Harley Copen, physician by day, vigilante by night."
227,00:17:26,00:17:30,"But he doesn't kill anyone; he shoots them in the street, and then he fixes them up in the E.R."
228,00:17:30,00:17:37,Rumor had it that Ross had actual intercourse with his co-star Ginger Snuff.
229,00:17:37,00:17:40,But a frame-by-frame analysis unfortunately disproved that.
230,00:17:40,00:17:41,WILLOWS: I'll call LAPD.
231,00:17:41,00:17:44,I wonder if actor man owns a .38.
232,00:17:46,00:17:49,"SIMMS: Okay, I just need you to open your..."
233,00:17:49,00:17:50,mouth.
234,00:17:51,00:17:53,(chuckles)
235,00:17:53,00:17:54,That tickles. (giggles)
236,00:17:54,00:17:56,"They searched his place in Hollywood, no gun."
237,00:17:56,00:17:57,But they found these.
238,00:17:57,00:17:59,They don't make that ammo anymore.
239,00:18:02,00:18:07,"It's the same caliber, same brand, same oxidation."
240,00:18:07,00:18:09,He's a triple threat.
241,00:18:09,00:18:13,You let me know what comes back from the...
242,00:18:13,00:18:15,electrophoresis gel.
243,00:18:15,00:18:17,It's how they blood-type DNA. Mm.
244,00:18:17,00:18:19,I played a medical examiner inKiller Instinct 3.
245,00:18:19,00:18:24,"Well, I'll catch that on the History Channel, 'cause we stopped blood-typing about 15 years ago."
246,00:18:24,00:18:26,Ah.
247,00:18:26,00:18:28,Is he hitting on you?
248,00:18:28,00:18:29,"SIMMS: Yeah, but not very well."
249,00:18:29,00:18:35,"(phone beeps) Mm, and luckily I have to go, 'cause somebody lost a contact lens."
250,00:18:40,00:18:43,"Look, this is just a big misunderstanding, Detective."
251,00:18:43,00:18:44,Mm-hmm.
252,00:18:44,00:18:46,I loved Jena; I would never hurt her.
253,00:18:46,00:18:48,Where were you two nights ago?
254,00:18:48,00:18:49,I was in LA.
255,00:18:49,00:18:50,Wrong.
256,00:18:50,00:18:52,You were with Jena in her motel room.
257,00:18:52,00:18:53,"No, I was in LA."
258,00:18:53,00:18:55,Save it.
259,00:18:55,00:18:56,"The tortoise gave you up, man."
260,00:18:56,00:18:58,We found your prints on his shell in Jena's blood.
261,00:18:59,00:19:01,"Wait a minute, you have Gareth?"
262,00:19:01,00:19:02,Is he okay? Can I see him?
263,00:19:02,00:19:05,"That puts you at the murder, jackass."
264,00:19:08,00:19:09,"All right, okay."
265,00:19:09,00:19:10,"Yeah, I-I was there."
266,00:19:10,00:19:11,Right.
267,00:19:11,00:19:13,But I didn't kill her.
268,00:19:13,00:19:16,Jena was going through some stuff.
269,00:19:16,00:19:19,"Okay? So she wanted to go to Vegas to, uh..."
270,00:19:19,00:19:21,"pick herself up, have a little fun."
271,00:19:21,00:19:22,You know?
272,00:19:22,00:19:25,"So I thought I'd just drop in on her, and I brought Gareth."
273,00:19:25,00:19:27,She loved that tortoise.
274,00:19:27,00:19:29,(sniffles)
275,00:19:29,00:19:38,"But when I got to the... room, I found her dead with a gun in her hand."
276,00:19:38,00:19:43,"And instead of calling the police, you cleaned up the scene, you took the gun and her cell phone, and you went back to LA."
277,00:19:43,00:19:46,"Yes, because I knew how bad it looked."
278,00:19:46,00:19:47,(sniffles)
279,00:19:47,00:19:48,Do you have any idea...
280,00:19:48,00:19:51,any idea at all how... this makes me feel?
281,00:19:51,00:19:54,To not know that my wife was suicidal...
282,00:19:54,00:19:56,my own wife!
283,00:19:56,00:20:01,But I was too self-absorbed to even recognize her pain.
284,00:20:01,00:20:07,Jena was the one real thing in my life.
285,00:20:07,00:20:09,MICKEY (on voice mail): Jena! Jena!
286,00:20:09,00:20:13,You think I'm just gonna let you play me like a bitch while you run off with that piece of crap?
287,00:20:13,00:20:16,"You know me better than that, you whore!"
288,00:20:18,00:20:22,"See, you can ditch a gun, you can toss a cell phone, but voice mails are forever."
289,00:20:22,00:20:26,"Even when you delete them off your own phone, huh?"
290,00:20:50,00:20:52,"VARTANN: She didn't kill herself, Mickey."
291,00:20:52,00:20:53,Give it up.
292,00:20:53,00:20:54,You're nailed.
293,00:20:55,00:20:56,This is all because of Tripp.
294,00:20:56,00:20:57,"No, this is all because of you."
295,00:20:57,00:21:00,Tripp Linson-- he's a producer I met four years ago.
296,00:21:00,00:21:03,"He was gonna produce my comeback feature,Enemy of the People."
297,00:21:03,00:21:05,"It was written up inVariety, maybe you saw it."
298,00:21:05,00:21:07,"Come on, Mickey!"
299,00:21:07,00:21:11,"This guy talks me out of 200 Gs to invest in his little movie, okay?"
300,00:21:11,00:21:14,And then he talks his way into my wife's pants.
301,00:21:14,00:21:16,They become a thing.
302,00:21:16,00:21:17,But I forgive her.
303,00:21:17,00:21:21,"Then a couple of days ago, I go to the house, and I get this little note."
304,00:21:21,00:21:27,"The note says, ""We're done."" She's gonna run off with Tripp."
305,00:21:27,00:21:29,"So I check the credit card company, find out where she is."
306,00:21:29,00:21:31,"I go to the motel, and I find her."
307,00:21:31,00:21:34,"She's in there, and she's just crying her eyes out."
308,00:21:34,00:21:37,"She found Tripp, but he..."
309,00:21:37,00:21:40,the bastard pretended he didn't even know who she was.
310,00:21:42,00:21:45,Gareth cheered her up. (sniffles)
311,00:21:45,00:21:48,And then we... we recommitted to each other.
312,00:21:48,00:21:49,You recommitted?
313,00:21:49,00:21:50,The ME called it rape-murder.
314,00:21:50,00:21:53,Rather than be with me...
315,00:21:56,00:21:59,...my wife killed herself.
316,00:21:59,00:22:02,(sniffles): This is our second chance.
317,00:22:02,00:22:04,"You and me, baby! Forever!"
318,00:22:05,00:22:07,(gunshot)
319,00:22:13,00:22:15,"VARTANN: That's a nice try, Mickey."
320,00:22:16,00:22:19,"But when people blow their brains out, they only pull the trigger once."
321,00:22:19,00:22:21,"Now, Jena..."
322,00:22:21,00:22:23,was shot twice.
323,00:22:23,00:22:25,"No, that's not possible."
324,00:22:25,00:22:27,I was there-- I only heard one shot.
325,00:22:31,00:22:33,One shot.
326,00:22:33,00:22:36,SANDERS: Sometimes the gunpowder in old ammunition doesn't burn completely.
327,00:22:36,00:22:41,"This results in shallow rifling marks on the bullet, which only gets partway down the barrel."
328,00:22:41,00:22:51,"If you don't realize what's happened and you try again, the second bullet impacts the first, leaving an indentation in the base and forcing both bullets out of the barrel."
329,00:22:51,00:22:54,And that... is how you get a twofer.
330,00:22:54,00:22:56,(shower running)
331,00:23:05,00:23:08,MICKEY: This is our second chance.
332,00:23:08,00:23:10,(hammer cocks)
333,00:23:10,00:23:12,"You and me, baby!"
334,00:23:12,00:23:14,Forever!
335,00:23:14,00:23:16,(gunshot)
336,00:23:16,00:23:18,What do you know.
337,00:23:18,00:23:21,Mickey Rosswas telling the truth.
338,00:23:23,00:23:24,"INTERVIEWER: Tripp, can you give us a second?"
339,00:23:25,00:23:29,"Look, you know what you get when you have... you have the perfect actor in the perfect part in the perfect script?"
340,00:23:30,00:23:32,"One word, dude: immortality."
341,00:23:32,00:23:36,I'm not gonna even have to ask Mickey to act-- this guy has lived this.
342,00:23:36,00:23:37,Tripp Linson is awesome.
343,00:23:37,00:23:39,"INTERVIEWER: Jena, what have you got there?"
344,00:23:39,00:23:41,"(chuckles): Not ""what."" Who."
345,00:23:41,00:23:43,"Say hello, Gareth."
346,00:23:43,00:23:44,(chuckles)
347,00:23:44,00:23:46,He's a gift.
348,00:23:46,00:23:47,For Mickey.
349,00:23:47,00:23:49,"Um, slow and steady wins the race, dude."
350,00:23:49,00:23:51,We start filming this summer.
351,00:23:51,00:23:53,Go see this movie. You're never going to regret it.
352,00:23:53,00:23:54,"Ray, excuse me."
353,00:23:54,00:23:56,Could you come in here for a minute?
354,00:23:56,00:23:58,You need to see this.
355,00:23:59,00:24:03,It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.
356,00:24:03,00:24:06,"That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington."
357,00:24:06,00:24:08,WILLOWS: It is.
358,00:24:08,00:24:09,And it isn't.
359,00:24:10,00:24:12,"Hey, do either one of you recognize this guy-- Ryan Morton?"
360,00:24:12,00:24:14,He kind of looks...
361,00:24:14,00:24:16,familiar.
362,00:24:37,00:24:39,(bones crack) (grunts): Oh...
363,00:24:39,00:24:42,I think I just threw out my back. Seriously?
364,00:24:42,00:24:44,Oh...
365,00:24:44,00:24:45,I'm good. (grunts) (bones crack)
366,00:24:45,00:24:47,"STOKES: No, no, come on out of there, Super Dave."
367,00:24:47,00:24:48,Take a break; we'll get him.
368,00:24:48,00:24:50,"Jimmy, get him out of there for me, will ya?"
369,00:24:50,00:24:52,You all right? Yeah.
370,00:24:52,00:24:54,(Phillips groans)
371,00:24:54,00:24:56,STOKES: Easy. There you go.
372,00:24:56,00:24:58,ADAMS: There's a body shoved under the steering column.
373,00:24:58,00:25:03,"So, I think it's safe to say somebody didn't want him to be found."
374,00:25:03,00:25:06,"No shell casings, no apparent blood."
375,00:25:06,00:25:08,Phone.
376,00:25:08,00:25:10,Did you get an ID on him?
377,00:25:10,00:25:12,Here you go.
378,00:25:13,00:25:15,His name's Shawn Hagan.
379,00:25:15,00:25:19,He's a PI from Tahoe.
380,00:25:19,00:25:21,(bone cracking) Wow. Rigor is fully developed.
381,00:25:21,00:25:24,Makes TOD at least six to 12 hours ago.
382,00:25:24,00:25:26,No petechial hemorrhaging.
383,00:25:26,00:25:29,And no bruising on the neck.
384,00:25:29,00:25:31,So maybe a heart attack?
385,00:25:31,00:25:33,ADAMS: Or an OD?
386,00:25:33,00:25:35,But I don't see any drug paraphernalia around here.
387,00:25:36,00:25:41,The rental agreement said he picked up the car four days ago in LA.
388,00:25:41,00:25:45,"Yeah, and it looks like he was expensing it at $160 a day to a client."
389,00:25:45,00:25:51,"Well, if he bills clients like that for heaps like these, we're gonna have a lot of suspects."
390,00:25:53,00:25:55,"Lucky you were visiting Vegas, Dr. Anton."
391,00:25:55,00:25:57,What's your business with Shawn Hagan?
392,00:25:57,00:25:58,It's a personal matter.
393,00:25:59,00:26:01,Why do you want to know?
394,00:26:01,00:26:04,Mr. Hagan's case files are on their way down from Tahoe.
395,00:26:04,00:26:07,So nothing's gonna remain personal very long.
396,00:26:07,00:26:11,Mr. Hagan is helping me find a former business associate.
397,00:26:11,00:26:12,That's personal?
398,00:26:12,00:26:14,It's a private matter.
399,00:26:14,00:26:16,Have a seat.
400,00:26:18,00:26:20,Shawn Hagan was murdered last night.
401,00:26:20,00:26:22,(sighs)
402,00:26:22,00:26:25,Where were you?
403,00:26:25,00:26:29,"In my hotel room, all night, watching movies."
404,00:26:29,00:26:33,"If Shawn Hagan is dead, Ryan Morton had something to do with it."
405,00:26:33,00:26:36,"Let me guess, that would be your business associate, right?"
406,00:26:36,00:26:38,You know where we might find him?
407,00:26:38,00:26:40,No.
408,00:26:40,00:26:44,That's what Mr. Hagan was supposed to find out.
409,00:26:44,00:26:46,Here.
410,00:26:46,00:26:48,That's as much as I know.
411,00:26:49,00:26:52,I doubt it'll do you any good.
412,00:26:55,00:26:57,(bone cracking)
413,00:26:57,00:27:00,This reminds me of David's back.
414,00:27:00,00:27:02,(bone cracking)
415,00:27:02,00:27:03,(loud thud)
416,00:27:07,00:27:08,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
417,00:27:10,00:27:12,Hang on a second.
418,00:27:17,00:27:19,Looks like a contact lens.
419,00:27:23,00:27:25,He's not wearing the other one.
420,00:27:25,00:27:27,(blow lands)
421,00:27:27,00:27:29,Could be from the killer.
422,00:27:29,00:27:33,"I'll get it to Wendy, have her run the clothes for touch DNA as well."
423,00:27:33,00:27:35,(bones cracking)
424,00:27:42,00:27:45,"Nick, this is a gunshot wound."
425,00:27:45,00:27:46,Palm-side entry.
426,00:27:46,00:27:49,Sooting says that it's a contact wound.
427,00:27:49,00:27:50,Through and through?
428,00:27:50,00:27:52,Yeah. Hmm.
429,00:27:52,00:27:54,Then why didn't we find the bullet anywhere?
430,00:27:54,00:27:57,Or blood.
431,00:28:02,00:28:04,(quietly): Whew.
432,00:28:04,00:28:07,ROBBINS:Hagan grabs the gun in the course of the struggle. (gunshot)
433,00:28:08,00:28:16,"The bullet tracks along the skin inside the sleeve, reenters the torso, and deflects off a rib into both lungs, then off another rib into the diaphragm..."
434,00:28:17,00:28:19,finally coming to rest in the spleen.
435,00:28:22,00:28:24,Ballistic pinball.
436,00:28:24,00:28:27,More or less.
437,00:28:27,00:28:28,Hmm.
438,00:28:34,00:28:36,Brass-washed .22.
439,00:28:37,00:28:39,High-penetration round.
440,00:28:39,00:28:44,Bullets sometimes take a long and winding road before they reach their ultimate destination.
441,00:28:45,00:28:46,"Some people, too."
442,00:28:52,00:28:54,(typing)
443,00:28:55,00:28:58,RYAN MORTON: Lake Tahoe-- the Golden West.
444,00:28:58,00:29:00,This is where fortunes are made.
445,00:29:00,00:29:03,"Hi. My name is Ryan Morton, and I want to make you rich."
446,00:29:03,00:29:12,This country was forged by wildcat entrepreneurs who struck out across an untamed continent to find mountains of timber and rivers of gold.
447,00:29:13,00:29:18,Those mother lodes are still out there waiting for those who dare to dream.
448,00:29:18,00:29:19,"(dog barks, Morton chuckles)"
449,00:29:20,00:29:22,"Looks like Gareth thinks so, too."
450,00:29:22,00:29:28,"Your investment in Royal Tahoe property can yield a 24% return, or even higher."
451,00:29:28,00:29:33,"For a taste of the frontier spirit that made America great, give me a call."
452,00:29:35,00:29:39,It's hard to believe people actually fall for this crap. I don't know.
453,00:29:39,00:29:42,Have you ever known anyone to hit a royal flush playing video poker?
454,00:29:42,00:29:43,"Oh, of course. So..."
455,00:29:43,00:29:44,"then it could happen to you, right?"
456,00:29:45,00:29:51,"(chuckles) You know, there's something about this guy that looks familiar."
457,00:29:51,00:29:53,Hey.
458,00:29:53,00:29:58,Look what Sanitation turned up in a Dumpster two blocks from Shawn Hagan's murder scene.
459,00:29:58,00:29:59,.22 caliber? Yeah.
460,00:29:59,00:30:01,Nice. Same as the bullet.
461,00:30:01,00:30:03,Did you run ballistics?
462,00:30:03,00:30:04,"Oh, I will."
463,00:30:04,00:30:06,But it's got a serial number.
464,00:30:06,00:30:07,Guess who it's registered to.
465,00:30:07,00:30:13,Ballistics confirmsyourgun fired the bullet that killed Shawn Hagan.
466,00:30:13,00:30:17,This gun hasn't been in my possession for years.
467,00:30:17,00:30:18,"So, what, you misplaced it?"
468,00:30:19,00:30:21,No. I gave it to Ryan Morton.
469,00:30:21,00:30:23,It was a gift.
470,00:30:23,00:30:25,Can you prove that?
471,00:30:25,00:30:27,No. Have you found him yet?
472,00:30:27,00:30:28,CAVALIERE: We got a broadcast out.
473,00:30:28,00:30:31,And he'll turn up. Hagan said he found him.
474,00:30:31,00:30:32,Here's what I think happened.
475,00:30:32,00:30:39,"I think Hagan told you he found Ryan in Las Vegas, but then he decided he wanted more money than you agreed upon for delivery."
476,00:30:39,00:30:43,"So you arranged to meet Hagan in his car, but you weren't gonna be jerked around anymore."
477,00:30:43,00:30:45,That's why you decided to bring your gun. No.
478,00:30:45,00:30:46,CAVALIERE: There's a struggle.
479,00:30:47,00:30:48,"He grabs the gun, and bam!"
480,00:30:48,00:30:51,"I had nothing to do with that! Hey, hey, hey, hey."
481,00:30:51,00:30:55,We understand that sometimes things just get out of control.
482,00:30:55,00:30:57,But you need to be truthful.
483,00:30:57,00:31:02,If you did not intend to shoot him... I did not shoot him!
484,00:31:03,00:31:05,Then you tell me what happened.
485,00:31:07,00:31:09,(sighs)
486,00:31:09,00:31:11,"Look, I met Ryan..."
487,00:31:11,00:31:14,at a tennis club in Tahoe.
488,00:31:14,00:31:19,"He grew up in Tonopah, not far from where I did."
489,00:31:20,00:31:24,He was developing a lot of real estate.
490,00:31:24,00:31:27,He was very ambitious.
491,00:31:27,00:31:36,"I lost my boy years ago in a divorce, and Ryan told me that his father had abandoned his family before he was born."
492,00:31:38,00:31:41,I gave him the gun for his birthday.
493,00:31:41,00:31:44,And then he got you to give him somerealmoney.
494,00:31:46,00:31:48,(chuckles)
495,00:31:48,00:31:53,He said he needed a completion loan for a house he was gonna flip.
496,00:31:53,00:31:56,"$175,000."
497,00:31:56,00:32:01,And I find out one day he left town.
498,00:32:01,00:32:04,Didn't even have a title to the house.
499,00:32:04,00:32:05,Why didn't you go to the police?
500,00:32:05,00:32:07,I'm a cardiac surgeon.
501,00:32:07,00:32:11,"My patients, my staff-- they have to have confidence in my judgment."
502,00:32:11,00:32:15,If they'd heard that I've been played like a rube...
503,00:32:15,00:32:16,Do you wear contact lenses?
504,00:32:16,00:32:17,Yes. Why?
505,00:32:18,00:32:19,DNA sample.
506,00:32:19,00:32:21,I'm gonna need one.
507,00:32:22,00:32:25,Take whatever you need.
508,00:32:27,00:32:29,"WILLOWS: Ray, excuse me."
509,00:32:29,00:32:31,Could you come in here for a minute?
510,00:32:31,00:32:33,You need to see this.
511,00:32:35,00:32:39,It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.
512,00:32:39,00:32:41,"LANGSTON: That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington."
513,00:32:41,00:32:43,WILLOWS: It is. And it isn't.
514,00:32:43,00:32:47,"STOKES: Hey, do either one of you recognize this guy-- Ryan Morton?"
515,00:32:47,00:32:49,(beeping)
516,00:32:49,00:32:51,"Hey, Nick. Yeah?"
517,00:32:51,00:32:58,"The DNA from the doctor didn't match the sample from the contact lens, and then CODIS drew a blank, so just to be thorough, I ran it against all the other case profiles."
518,00:32:58,00:33:00,And you got a match? I got a sibling match.
519,00:33:00,00:33:05,That contact lens DNA had seven alleles in common with Carsten Pennington.
520,00:33:05,00:33:07,AKA Tripp Linson.
521,00:33:07,00:33:08,AKA Ryan Morton.
522,00:33:08,00:33:10,He's got a brother.
523,00:33:10,00:33:12,Who just might be our killer.
524,00:33:14,00:33:16,WILLOWS: Gareth Morton? The brother's name is Gareth?
525,00:33:16,00:33:17,"Yes, like the cat."
526,00:33:17,00:33:18,And the tortoise.
527,00:33:18,00:33:20,And the dog.
528,00:33:20,00:33:21,(sighs)
529,00:33:21,00:33:22,Some people.
530,00:33:22,00:33:24,It's no surprise when they end up dead.
531,00:33:25,00:33:27,We checked the local records in Tonopah.
532,00:33:27,00:33:31,Ryan and Gareth Morton own a house that was left to them by their mother.
533,00:33:31,00:33:33,We tried to contact Gareth there.
534,00:33:33,00:33:35,No answer. Local PD couldn't find him.
535,00:33:35,00:33:42,I had Archie go back over the surveillance at Carsten's cocktail party and guess what?
536,00:33:42,00:33:45,We found Gareth.
537,00:33:51,00:33:55,That places Gareth in Las Vegas the night of Carsten's murder.
538,00:33:55,00:33:57,(sighs): Okay.
539,00:33:57,00:33:59,WILLOWS: Quick timeline...
540,00:33:59,00:34:04,Jena Makin sees her old flame Tripp in a Vegas magazine.
541,00:34:04,00:34:07,She makes a last-ditch attempt for love.
542,00:34:07,00:34:11,She finds Tripp and throws herself at him.
543,00:34:11,00:34:13,"LANGSTON: Unfortunately, he's not Tripp anymore."
544,00:34:13,00:34:18,"He's Carsten Pennington, art dealer, living in a rented mansion, so he claims he doesn't recognize her."
545,00:34:18,00:34:23,And Jena goes back to the motel and blows her brains out.
546,00:34:23,00:34:34,"STOKES: A day later, a PI tracking down real estate fraudster Ryan Morton meets his brother Gareth and probably by accident, Gareth kills the PI in his car."
547,00:34:34,00:34:43,"Then, later that night, Gareth shows up at Carsten's party-- uninvited, no doubt-- smashes his head in, dumps him in the pool."
548,00:34:43,00:34:45,And brother Gareth's in the wind.
549,00:34:45,00:34:48,His description's out on broadcast. (phone beeping)
550,00:34:48,00:34:53,"But right now, that's about all we can do. If he's smart, he's not in the country."
551,00:34:53,00:34:56,"Apparently, he's not that smart."
552,00:35:00,00:35:03,"Speeding, Gareth, is a crime."
553,00:35:03,00:35:11,"And when you have a bench warrant for a couple unpaid parking tickets, that gets you a couple of days lockup in Pahrump."
554,00:35:11,00:35:13,What do you think this gets you?
555,00:35:13,00:35:14,Check this out.
556,00:35:14,00:35:16,Look closely.
557,00:35:16,00:35:19,That's your contact lens.
558,00:35:19,00:35:23,That's your DNA on a dead guy.
559,00:35:23,00:35:26,Want to tell me how it got there?
560,00:35:26,00:35:31,"Hagan came to see me in Tonopah, four days ago."
561,00:35:33,00:35:34,He slapped me.
562,00:35:34,00:35:37,"Now, why would he go and do a mean thing like that?"
563,00:35:37,00:35:41,'Cause he wanted 175K that Ryan stole from his client.
564,00:35:41,00:35:46,I-I told Hagan I hadn't heard from Ryan in years.
565,00:35:46,00:35:48,That his debts weren't my problem.
566,00:35:48,00:35:50,Hmm.
567,00:35:50,00:35:56,"And he said, oh, well, they were now because Ma left him half of the house."
568,00:35:56,00:35:58,They put a lien on it.
569,00:35:58,00:36:10,"He told me that Ryan was living in Vegas under the name Carsten Pennington, and he was living in a mansion and rolling in dough."
570,00:36:10,00:36:16,"So, there you are, sitting up in a shack in Tonopah, in a house you don't even own free and clear because of your brother and Mr. Hagan."
571,00:36:16,00:36:18,"That must have chapped your ass, huh?"
572,00:36:18,00:36:21,"Yeah, that house should have been mine."
573,00:36:21,00:36:25,31 years I lived in that house with Ma.
574,00:36:25,00:36:33,"Hauled her to church, to the beauty parlor, even changed her diapers in the end."
575,00:36:36,00:36:38,And all she ever talked about was Ryan.
576,00:36:38,00:36:39,"Sure, okay."
577,00:36:39,00:36:44,"So you left for Vegas, you know, with the ""Mom always loved you best"" rage, right?"
578,00:36:44,00:36:46,Then what? You found Hagan and killed him?
579,00:36:46,00:36:48,I didn't kill Hagan.
580,00:36:48,00:36:51,"Look, I went to see Ryan."
581,00:36:51,00:36:59,"I hung outside his-his party until all the other guests had left, and then I asked him to quitclaim the house to me."
582,00:36:59,00:37:01,Why the hell should I?
583,00:37:01,00:37:02,Mom wanted me to have half.
584,00:37:02,00:37:04,I'm not gonna deny her dying wish.
585,00:37:04,00:37:06,You never gave a rat's ass about her.
586,00:37:06,00:37:12,"Every-every birthday, every Christmas she was waiting for a card or a phone call or something."
587,00:37:12,00:37:13,"And never, not one word from you."
588,00:37:13,00:37:16,"And still, you were all she was thinking about."
589,00:37:16,00:37:21,So I'm supposed to feel guilty because you decided to chain yourself to that sadistic bitch?
590,00:37:21,00:37:24,After all the things she did to us?
591,00:37:24,00:37:26,You want to know why I was her favorite?
592,00:37:26,00:37:29,Because I had the guts to get out.
593,00:37:29,00:37:31,To live my own life.
594,00:37:31,00:37:33,"Hell, I've lived five lives."
595,00:37:33,00:37:35,You didn't have the guts to live one.
596,00:37:35,00:37:37,Then what?
597,00:37:37,00:37:40,And then... I left.
598,00:37:40,00:37:43,You left? You just walked away?
599,00:37:43,00:37:44,Why?
600,00:37:44,00:37:46,Because he was right about me-- I'm weak.
601,00:37:46,00:37:48,What do you mean?
602,00:37:49,00:37:56,"When we were growing up, you know, all the kids in the neighborhood crowded around him, and..."
603,00:37:58,00:38:01,...I just faded into his shadow.
604,00:38:03,00:38:06,He had this charisma.
605,00:38:10,00:38:14,He was electric.
606,00:38:14,00:38:19,"And even after all this went down, I still... I still loved him."
607,00:38:23,00:38:28,I just didn't have the courage to tell him.
608,00:38:28,00:38:30,(camera shutter clicking)
609,00:38:30,00:38:31,Isn't this sweet?
610,00:38:31,00:38:34,He drives Mommy's old Cutlass to go commit murder.
611,00:38:35,00:38:41,"Okay, this is everything Gareth had on him or with him at the time he was arrested."
612,00:38:49,00:38:50,One contact lens missing.
613,00:38:50,00:38:53,That's bad news for Gareth.
614,00:39:10,00:39:13,What do we have here?
615,00:39:13,00:39:15,This is about a hundred grand.
616,00:39:15,00:39:18,Maybe he figures a car trunk is safer than a 401(k).
617,00:39:18,00:39:20,"These days, he's probably right."
618,00:39:41,00:39:43,These are Burberrys.
619,00:39:43,00:39:47,Everything else here is from Dempsey's bargain basement.
620,00:39:47,00:39:51,What's a half-broke kid from Tonopah doing in a $50 pair of underwear?
621,00:39:51,00:39:54,LANGSTON: I think I can answer that.
622,00:39:54,00:39:59,Because the body we fished out of Carsten Pennington's pool was wearing Dempsey's underwear.
623,00:39:59,00:40:02,BRASS: We found a hundred grand in your car.
624,00:40:02,00:40:04,Ryan gave it to me.
625,00:40:04,00:40:07,Why didn't you tell us about it?
626,00:40:07,00:40:09,Taxes.
627,00:40:09,00:40:11,I didn't want to pay taxes on it.
628,00:40:12,00:40:13,I'm sure Ryan didn't.
629,00:40:13,00:40:17,"Ryan wouldn't sign a quitclaim for the house, and he gives you $100,000 free and clear?"
630,00:40:17,00:40:21,That sounds a tad inconsistent.
631,00:40:21,00:40:23,"Look, I don't pretend to understand my brother."
632,00:40:24,00:40:25,All right?
633,00:40:25,00:40:28,But why-why would I kill him when he gave me that money?
634,00:40:28,00:40:29,"Look, all brothers fight."
635,00:40:29,00:40:31,I threw my brother through a screen door.
636,00:40:31,00:40:33,He broke a bowl of oatmeal on my head.
637,00:40:34,00:40:36,But I can't imagine killing him.
638,00:40:36,00:40:37,"So, help me understand."
639,00:40:37,00:40:42,"I think this thing started in the house in Tonopah, and ended in that swimming pool."
640,00:40:42,00:40:44,"He's going to go down for this, Darcy."
641,00:40:46,00:40:50,"The only question is, are you going to go down with him?"
642,00:40:50,00:40:55,"If I were you, I would take a hard look at that bimbo of his."
643,00:40:55,00:40:58,"What's her name, Darcy?"
644,00:40:58,00:41:01,"When Ryan gave me the cash, she freaked out."
645,00:41:01,00:41:05,"She was really pissed, and there was murder in her eyes."
646,00:41:05,00:41:08,You guys should check her out.
647,00:41:08,00:41:11,That's not Gareth.
648,00:41:11,00:41:12,It's Carsten.
649,00:41:12,00:41:17,"GARETH: Every Christmas and birthday she'd wait for a card or a phone call, something."
650,00:41:17,00:41:18,"Not one word, ever."
651,00:41:18,00:41:21,And still... you were all she thought about at the end.
652,00:41:21,00:41:22,I said shut up!
653,00:41:22,00:41:24,(loud thud)
654,00:41:30,00:41:32,Carsten?
655,00:41:33,00:41:35,(grunting)
656,00:41:35,00:41:39,DARCY: He said that Gareth threatened to kill us both.
657,00:41:39,00:41:42,That there was no other way out.
658,00:41:45,00:41:50,He took Gareth's identity and said he'd come back for me.
659,00:41:50,00:41:53,And I believed him.
660,00:42:02,00:42:06,It's not true what my brother says about me.
661,00:42:06,00:42:09,"I tried to make amends, but he wouldn't let me."
662,00:42:14,00:42:15,"Here, Ma."
663,00:42:15,00:42:18,I want you to have this.
664,00:42:18,00:42:20,"Ryan, I can't."
665,00:42:22,00:42:24,What the hell is that?
666,00:42:26,00:42:28,We don't need your help.
667,00:42:28,00:42:30,We're getting by just fine.
668,00:42:30,00:42:33,"What, on your-your lousy, uh, $450 a week?"
669,00:42:33,00:42:34,"You're lucky Mom's here, or I'd..."
670,00:42:34,00:42:37,"What? Boys, don't fight."
671,00:42:37,00:42:39,You haven't changed a bit.
672,00:42:40,00:42:41,Don't forget your money.
673,00:42:42,00:42:43,You need it more than us.
674,00:42:43,00:42:46,"It's the, uh... only thing you ever loved."
675,00:42:52,00:42:55,BRASS: Wow...
676,00:42:55,00:42:59,That is so... sad.
677,00:42:59,00:43:03,What old movie did you steal it from?
678,00:43:05,00:43:08,"Well, you're just one lie wrapped in another, huh?"
679,00:43:09,00:43:12,It's the truth.
680,00:43:16,00:43:18,Even if it never happened.
