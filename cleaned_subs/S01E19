0,00:00:26,00:00:29,(clock quietly ticking)
1,00:00:43,00:00:45,(creaking)
2,00:01:04,00:01:06,(gasping)
3,00:01:17,00:01:20,(screaming): NO!
4,00:01:30,00:01:32,(sirens blaring)
5,00:01:32,00:01:34,(indistinct radio transmission)
6,00:01:39,00:01:41,Excuse me.
7,00:01:41,00:01:42,My name's Gil Grissom.
8,00:01:42,00:01:44,I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
9,00:01:44,00:01:45,Please help us.
10,00:01:45,00:01:47,I'll certainly try.
11,00:01:50,00:01:52,Is that the ransom note?
12,00:01:52,00:01:56,Yeah. They don't even say how much money they want.
13,00:01:56,00:01:58,They just say that they'll call us in six hours.
14,00:01:58,00:02:01,Have you let anyone else touch this note?
15,00:02:01,00:02:03,"Police, a relative, anyone?"
16,00:02:03,00:02:04,"N-no, just us. Why?"
17,00:02:04,00:02:08,"Well, because the person who touched it before you has your son..."
18,00:02:08,00:02:11,and he's just left us the first piece of the puzzle.
19,00:02:48,00:02:50,"Jim, Dispatch said this is a kidnapping?"
20,00:02:50,00:02:51,Divorce situation?
21,00:02:51,00:02:53,No papers filed.College sweethearts.
22,00:02:53,00:02:55,Neighbors say they're the salt of the earth.
23,00:02:56,00:02:57,So this could have been legitimate?
24,00:02:57,00:02:59,They have a security system.
25,00:02:59,00:03:01,Never put it on.
26,00:03:01,00:03:02,They say how come?
27,00:03:02,00:03:04,They feel safe in the neighborhood.
28,00:03:04,00:03:06,Check the premises?
29,00:03:06,00:03:08,"Attic, wine cellar, crawl space."
30,00:03:08,00:03:09,No four-month-old baby.
31,00:03:12,00:03:13,Nice digs.
32,00:03:13,00:03:15,"Yeah, guy got rich off some dot-com outfit."
33,00:03:15,00:03:17,Moved here from Oregon two years ago.
34,00:03:17,00:03:19,Bet they wished they hadn't today.
35,00:03:19,00:03:21,Are you sure he won't hear a click or something?
36,00:03:21,00:03:23,He won't.
37,00:03:23,00:03:25,"And if he asks, you and your wife are alone."
38,00:03:25,00:03:26,Question him about your son.
39,00:03:26,00:03:28,Ask to hear him breathing.
40,00:03:28,00:03:29,Anything to keep the guy talking.
41,00:03:29,00:03:30,Understood?
42,00:03:30,00:03:31,I don't know.
43,00:03:31,00:03:33,"Yeah, yeah."
44,00:03:33,00:03:34,Okay.
45,00:03:34,00:03:36,Built my own business.
46,00:03:36,00:03:38,I can handle any kind of pressure.
47,00:03:42,00:03:43,GRISSOM: Was this yours?
48,00:03:43,00:03:46,Yeah.
49,00:03:46,00:03:48,May I ask when you opened it?
50,00:03:48,00:03:49,I don't know.
51,00:03:50,00:03:52,"Um, sometime after we called 9-1-1."
52,00:03:55,00:03:57,"You mind if I, uh...?"
53,00:03:57,00:03:59,"No, no, go ahead."
54,00:04:14,00:04:15,You have any more of these?
55,00:04:15,00:04:17,In the fridge.
56,00:04:17,00:04:19,Thanks.
57,00:04:19,00:04:21,WOMAN: Do my boys have to be here?
58,00:04:21,00:04:25,I think this is hard enough for them without having to hear the facts.
59,00:04:25,00:04:29,"BRASS: I understand, but it's best for our investigation if we keep the whole family together."
60,00:04:29,00:04:31,"It's okay, Mom."
61,00:04:31,00:04:33,"You were saying, Mrs. Anderson?"
62,00:04:33,00:04:34,Um...
63,00:04:34,00:04:39,"I got up at 4:30, like I usually do to feed Zack."
64,00:04:39,00:04:41,I'm still breast-feeding.
65,00:04:41,00:04:43,And I went down to Zacky's room.
66,00:04:43,00:04:45,I looked in his crib and he was gone.
67,00:04:45,00:04:47,He wasn't there.
68,00:04:47,00:04:52,And I felt around for him and that's when I found the letter saying that he had been taken and I...I don't know.
69,00:04:52,00:04:56,I-I think I screamed...
70,00:04:56,00:04:57,"You screamed, Mom."
71,00:04:57,00:05:04,"I jumped out of bed and I went to her, and that's when we called 9-1-1 from the upstairs hallway."
72,00:05:05,00:05:07,9-1-1-1-1-1.
73,00:05:07,00:05:09,"Give me the phone, Robbie."
74,00:05:09,00:05:11,We're going to need a piece of the baby's clothing.
75,00:05:11,00:05:14,"Something from his hamper, if possible."
76,00:05:14,00:05:16,We're going to use scent dogs throughout the neighborhood.
77,00:05:16,00:05:19,I'll go see what I can find.
78,00:05:19,00:05:20,"No, I know what he wears."
79,00:05:20,00:05:22,I'll go with you.
80,00:05:25,00:05:30,GRISSOM: I'd also like to get blood samples from each family member.
81,00:05:30,00:05:37,"Why? Well, the sooner we can eliminate the expected hairs and fibers from within the household we can begin looking for outsiders."
82,00:05:37,00:05:38,Is it going to hurt?
83,00:05:39,00:05:42,I hope not.
84,00:05:52,00:05:53,Sara?
85,00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah?
86,00:05:54,00:05:55,Take this ransom note to Q.D.
87,00:05:55,00:05:56,Typewritten ransom note?
88,00:05:56,00:05:57,Kidnapper was organized.
89,00:05:58,00:06:00,I think it's ink-jet not typewriter.
90,00:06:00,00:06:04,"I'll get it to Questioned Documents check for origination prints, the works."
91,00:06:04,00:06:07,Take every computer and printer from the Anderson house with you.
92,00:06:07,00:06:11,You think the suspect printed the ransom note from inside the house while they were sleeping?
93,00:06:11,00:06:13,I'm not thinking anything yet.
94,00:06:13,00:06:15,Nick?
95,00:06:15,00:06:16,Yo.
96,00:06:16,00:06:18,"No, thanks, I'm an iced tea man."
97,00:06:18,00:06:20,It's not a refreshment.
98,00:06:20,00:06:21,It's an experiment.
99,00:06:21,00:06:25,"Now take this to the lab in a controlled space, 72 degrees Fahrenheit and open it."
100,00:06:25,00:06:28,Keep this in the same room-temp space.
101,00:06:28,00:06:30,"Okay, then what?"
102,00:06:30,00:06:33,"Process, Nick, process."
103,00:06:35,00:06:38,Baby's bedroom window is open and the ladder's still out there.
104,00:06:38,00:06:40,So canvass the whole grounds from outside to in.
105,00:06:41,00:06:43,I'm all over it like a cheap suit.
106,00:07:32,00:07:33,You see this spiderweb?
107,00:07:33,00:07:34,"Damn, Warrick!"
108,00:07:34,00:07:36,I'm sorry.
109,00:07:36,00:07:37,Your ticker okay?
110,00:07:39,00:07:40,What spiderweb?
111,00:07:40,00:07:43,Right here.
112,00:07:43,00:07:49,"Kind of hard to get a baby out of a window climb onto a ladder without messing up this web, don't you think?"
113,00:07:49,00:07:51,"Well, it could have happened after the abduction."
114,00:07:51,00:07:55,Spiders can build one of these things in a few hours.
115,00:08:05,00:08:07,Warrick?
116,00:08:07,00:08:08,What are you doing?
117,00:08:08,00:08:11,Go around.
118,00:08:24,00:08:28,"Ooh, you're right on the golf course."
119,00:08:28,00:08:30,That must be nice.
120,00:08:30,00:08:31,Steve likes it.
121,00:08:31,00:08:32,I never cared for the game.
122,00:08:32,00:08:34,(sighs)
123,00:08:36,00:08:40,"That one's my favorite but Zacky, he, uh..."
124,00:08:40,00:08:43,he liked another one.
125,00:08:43,00:08:45,Here it is.
126,00:08:45,00:08:47,(chuckles)
127,00:08:47,00:08:51,There's a little spit-up on it.
128,00:08:51,00:08:54,He liked the way the fabric felt on his skin.
129,00:09:00,00:09:03,"Oh, God..."
130,00:09:03,00:09:08,It's okay. It used to happen to me with my daughter if I didn't get to her right on time.
131,00:09:08,00:09:11,I can't believe that this is happening to us.
132,00:09:13,00:09:16,I'll get this to our guys.
133,00:09:29,00:09:31,What you got?
134,00:09:31,00:09:34,"Two hair, separate and distinctive."
135,00:09:34,00:09:38,"Ah, the plot thickens."
136,00:09:46,00:09:50,You smell something?
137,00:09:50,00:09:53,I smell these dirty diapers over here.
138,00:09:57,00:09:58,It's like a household cleanser.
139,00:09:58,00:10:00,There's a pine smell.
140,00:10:00,00:10:02,Probably used to clean that diaper pail.
141,00:10:02,00:10:04,"No, it's stronger than that."
142,00:10:06,00:10:09,And it's emanating from this specific spot.
143,00:10:34,00:10:35,Whew.
144,00:10:37,00:10:40,Baby was killed before it even left the house.
145,00:10:40,00:10:42,Guy tried to cover his tracks.
146,00:10:42,00:10:46,SIDLE: What do you mean you haven't checked for prints?
147,00:10:46,00:10:47,It's a ransom letter.
148,00:10:47,00:10:50,MAN: Everything in the proper order.You know that.
149,00:10:50,00:10:53,I got five other tests I got to run on this paper before I try to isolate prints.
150,00:10:53,00:10:54,You got anything for me?
151,00:10:54,00:10:56,Yeah. The paper's expensive.
152,00:10:56,00:10:57,High rag count.
153,00:10:57,00:10:58,I could have told you that.
154,00:10:58,00:11:01,Can you explain these three small vertical dots?
155,00:11:01,00:11:02,What? Where?
156,00:11:02,00:11:07,It tells me that the printer that emitted this letter has a spot on the drum.
157,00:11:07,00:11:11,A drum goes around three times to print one page.
158,00:11:15,00:11:17,So if the Andersons' printer was used...
159,00:11:19,00:11:23,There'd be three small dots on any paper that comes out.
160,00:11:25,00:11:26,No vertical dots.
161,00:11:26,00:11:31,And different paper than the ransom letter F.Y.I.
162,00:11:31,00:11:36,"Yeah, this mold I made of that shoe print matches the gardener's boot that I found in the shed over there."
163,00:11:36,00:11:40,"Yeah, well, we need to look for what'soutof place."
164,00:11:40,00:11:43,And a gardener's boot in a garden is not out of place.
165,00:11:43,00:11:47,"Well, the Andersons did say the guy's been out of town on vacation for the last three days."
166,00:11:47,00:11:48,(cell phone rings)
167,00:11:49,00:11:50,Grissom.
168,00:11:50,00:11:53,Ransom note's not from the Anderson's printer or paper supply.
169,00:11:53,00:11:54,You're breaking up.
170,00:11:54,00:11:56,The Andersons are clear.
171,00:11:56,00:12:00,Whoever wrote the letter did it from a different location and brought it with them.
172,00:12:00,00:12:03,Are you standing next to the copy machine outside ballistics?
173,00:12:03,00:12:05,You want me to check ballistics?
174,00:12:05,00:12:08,"No, I want you to move away from that machine."
175,00:12:08,00:12:12,"Look, check all the printers at Steve Anderson's company."
176,00:12:12,00:12:13,(dogs barking)
177,00:12:13,00:12:15,Get Q.D. to help you with a warrant.
178,00:12:15,00:12:21,Target all immediate co-workers and disgruntled employees first.
179,00:12:21,00:12:22,Are those our dogs?
180,00:12:22,00:12:24,Grissom? Grissom!
181,00:12:24,00:12:27,(dogs barking frenetically)
182,00:12:40,00:12:41,Get those dogs back.
183,00:12:42,00:12:43,Get them back!
184,00:12:55,00:12:57,Stand back.
185,00:12:57,00:12:59,"Well, we got to have pictures."
186,00:12:59,00:13:00,The coroner will be all over us.
187,00:13:00,00:13:03,I'll get the pictures!
188,00:13:24,00:13:26,I'm going to take him.
189,00:13:39,00:13:41,"MRS. ANDERSON: Oh, God, my baby!"
190,00:13:41,00:13:43,"Oh, my God, my baby! No!"
191,00:13:43,00:13:45,(no audio)
192,00:13:53,00:13:55,(screaming): My baby!
193,00:13:55,00:13:58,My baby!
194,00:13:59,00:14:03,"Oh, my God!"
195,00:14:03,00:14:04,"Oh, my God!"
196,00:14:09,00:14:12,(wailing)
197,00:14:16,00:14:22,"ANCHORWOMAN: The Andersons, who own a profitable Internet company in Las Vegas, are said to be devastated by the death of little Zachary."
198,00:14:22,00:14:29,"As for leads, the police will only say they have widened the investigation to include employees of Steve Anderson's company."
199,00:14:29,00:14:32,Immediate coworkers are being asked to give DNA samples.
200,00:14:32,00:14:36,"By all accounts, the employees are complying voluntarily."
201,00:14:36,00:14:49,"One of them is quoted as saying ""Anything to help Mr. and Mrs. Anderson in their time of grief."" ROBBINS: I can't give you exact time of death, but I do know cause of death was asphyxiation."
202,00:14:49,00:14:51,He was smothered.
203,00:14:51,00:14:56,The retinal hemorrhages are the result of intercranial pressure from an edema.
204,00:14:56,00:15:00,The edema was caused by an acute lack of oxygen.
205,00:15:00,00:15:02,Smothered how?
206,00:15:02,00:15:05,Did you find hand marks trauma around the mouth or nose?
207,00:15:05,00:15:08,No.
208,00:15:09,00:15:11,He was in a blanket when I found him...
209,00:15:11,00:15:13,wrapped pretty tight.
210,00:15:13,00:15:15,Positional asphyxiation?
211,00:15:15,00:15:16,Maybe.
212,00:15:16,00:15:19,Abductor might have tried to protect him from the cold.
213,00:15:19,00:15:21,Suffocated him by mistake.
214,00:15:21,00:15:25,I'm going to run tests on a microscopic fiber I found in his throat.
215,00:15:27,00:15:30,"But I don't think his death was benign, Gil."
216,00:15:30,00:15:31,Or accidental.
217,00:15:31,00:15:33,Sternum was cracked.
218,00:15:33,00:15:35,X-rays say the fracture is fresh.
219,00:15:35,00:15:38,Manhandled andsuffocated.
220,00:15:38,00:15:41,This little guy didn't have a chance.
221,00:15:47,00:15:49,Are those from Anderson's company?
222,00:15:49,00:15:51,Yeah. There's like 200 of them in that place.
223,00:15:51,00:15:53,"I'm going to test them against the ransom note, one by one."
224,00:15:53,00:15:55,You got Homicide's list of disgruntled employees?
225,00:15:55,00:15:57,They're still working on it.
226,00:15:57,00:16:00,You call Homicide back and tell them to get us that list now.
227,00:16:01,00:16:03,Hey.
228,00:16:03,00:16:08,Hey.Where are we on those DNA samples? I got the hair samples from the baby's crib ready for comparison.
229,00:16:08,00:16:11,Yeah? So answer my question.
230,00:16:11,00:16:13,"Well, DNA's jammed."
231,00:16:13,00:16:16,Sanders says he'll get to the blood comparisons as soon as...
232,00:16:20,00:16:22,I hear you're backlogged.
233,00:16:23,00:16:26,"20 ""Unknowns"" from some drug shoot-out."
234,00:16:26,00:16:28,FBI special request.
235,00:16:28,00:16:31,Sheriff told me to clear it off my counter before I do anything else.
236,00:16:31,00:16:32,These?
237,00:16:32,00:16:35,"Yeah. You can almost smell Quantico, huh?"
238,00:16:44,00:16:45,There.
239,00:16:45,00:16:48,Now they're off your counter.
240,00:16:48,00:16:52,"Zachary Anderson, date of birth 01-23-01."
241,00:16:52,00:16:53,"Date of death, three hours ago."
242,00:16:53,00:16:56,Until we find out how and why...
243,00:17:00,00:17:01,this is the only case you work on.
244,00:17:01,00:17:02,"Yes, sir."
245,00:17:04,00:17:06,Never seen him like this before.
246,00:17:07,00:17:08,Grissom?
247,00:17:08,00:17:09,What?
248,00:17:09,00:17:14,You told me a few weeks ago that nothing is personal.
249,00:17:14,00:17:16,No victim should be special.
250,00:17:16,00:17:18,Everyone follows your lead.
251,00:17:18,00:17:21,Everyone didn't find that baby.
252,00:17:21,00:17:22,I did.
253,00:17:22,00:17:26,"And that little boy is dead because someone lost their temper or screwed up, or God knows what."
254,00:17:26,00:17:31,"So, excuse me, but this victimisspecial."
255,00:17:31,00:17:33,Mr. and Mrs. Anderson are calling.
256,00:17:33,00:17:36,They want to know why you refuse to release the body for burial.
257,00:17:36,00:17:38,They said that you gave the coroner strict instructions.
258,00:17:38,00:17:40,(sighs)
259,00:17:40,00:17:42,You better drive.
260,00:17:42,00:17:44,Sure.
261,00:17:46,00:17:50,"GRISSOM: I'm very sorry, but we have to preserve the evidence in a case like this."
262,00:17:50,00:17:54,"And as difficult as this sounds, Zachary is evidence."
263,00:17:54,00:17:57,We need to refer to him as the case unfolds.
264,00:17:57,00:17:59,"Well, do you have any leads?"
265,00:17:59,00:18:00,Any idea who did this?
266,00:18:00,00:18:08,"Your child was found 500 yards from your back door, in clean clothes wrapped in a white blanket, laid carefully under a statuary."
267,00:18:08,00:18:11,WILLOWS: A stranger wouldn't treat a victim like that.
268,00:18:11,00:18:14,You think we had something to do with this?
269,00:18:14,00:18:17,GRISSOM: The FBI tells us that you never received a call from the abductor.
270,00:18:18,00:18:21,What kind of a kidnapper forgets to call the family?
271,00:18:23,00:18:24,The wealthy family.
272,00:18:24,00:18:27,STEVE: My lawyer warned me that you were going to try this.
273,00:18:27,00:18:29,You don't have a suspect so now you're going to come after us.
274,00:18:29,00:18:30,But you have nothing to hide.
275,00:18:30,00:18:32,You're damn right we don't.
276,00:18:32,00:18:34,(knocking)
277,00:18:34,00:18:36,I thought I'd deliver this in person.
278,00:18:36,00:18:39,DNA came back on the entire family.
279,00:18:46,00:18:50,GRISSOM: The blood we found in the baby's room...belongs to your son Tyler.
280,00:18:55,00:18:59,I was playing ball in the backyard and I cracked Zacky's window.
281,00:18:59,00:19:02,Dad had told me not to hit the ball towards the house.
282,00:19:02,00:19:09,So I went up and replaced the window before anyone got home and I cut my finger on the glass.
283,00:19:09,00:19:14,And you wiped up the blood with some type of pine cleanser.
284,00:19:14,00:19:15,I thought I got it all.
285,00:19:15,00:19:18,"GRISSOM: Let's go back a second, Tyler."
286,00:19:18,00:19:23,You said that you baby-sat for Robbie and Zack last night right?
287,00:19:23,00:19:24,I told the police that this morning.
288,00:19:24,00:19:27,We had a Homeowner's Association Vote meeting.
289,00:19:27,00:19:29,It was just five doors up from our house.
290,00:19:29,00:19:33,"I had, uh...I had made dinner and then Steve and I walked up to the clubhouse."
291,00:19:33,00:19:36,"We were gone maybe 30 minutes, until 9:00."
292,00:19:36,00:19:38,We contacted the Association.
293,00:19:38,00:19:39,The story checks out.
294,00:19:39,00:19:42,I also did a background search.
295,00:19:42,00:19:44,"Tyler has quite a temper on him, don't you, Ty?"
296,00:19:44,00:19:45,What?
297,00:19:45,00:19:48,You were expelled from school twice last year for physical altercation.
298,00:19:48,00:19:51,That was school yard stuff.
299,00:19:51,00:19:54,CATHERINE: Beat up a 12-year-old in the school stairwell.
300,00:19:54,00:19:56,He made fun of my mother.
301,00:19:58,00:20:00,I wasn't going to let him get away with that.
302,00:20:00,00:20:03,"BRASS: Your brother Zack say something you weren't going to let him get away with, either?"
303,00:20:03,00:20:05,"Don't talk about my brother thatway, you bastard."
304,00:20:06,00:20:08,STEVE: Sit down.Now.
305,00:20:08,00:20:10,"GWEN: He's, uh...he's upset."
306,00:20:10,00:20:11,He is not usually like this.
307,00:20:15,00:20:17,People are calling us killers.
308,00:20:19,00:20:22,And I miss my little brother.
309,00:20:22,00:20:25,That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
310,00:20:37,00:20:40,So what are we looking for?
311,00:20:40,00:20:43,I don't know.
312,00:20:43,00:20:45,"Well, let's start up and work our way down."
313,00:22:17,00:22:19,Here's the father's bottle of cola.
314,00:22:19,00:22:20,Here's the Unknown.
315,00:22:20,00:22:29,I duplicated conditions and monitored the pressure that escaped from the father's bottle which he'd told you had been open two hours against one Iknow was open two hours.
316,00:22:29,00:22:31,Kept this log.
317,00:22:31,00:22:36,Pressure released every quarter hour.
318,00:22:38,00:22:39,"Good, Nick."
319,00:22:40,00:22:43,Did you find any ethanol on the lip of that bottle?
320,00:22:43,00:22:48,"Well, I've got Trace running tests now, but I did an unscientific whiff test."
321,00:22:48,00:22:50,Picked up a hint of some kind of booze.
322,00:22:52,00:22:54,Call me when you get the results.
323,00:22:54,00:22:59,See if they can find out what this green substance is on these nylons I found in Mr. Anderson's closet.
324,00:22:59,00:23:02,"I'll take a swatch, get it back to you ASAP."
325,00:23:05,00:23:06,GRISSOM: The mother's prints...
326,00:23:06,00:23:10,the father's prints...
327,00:23:10,00:23:12,and a set of Unknowns.
328,00:23:12,00:23:13,They're not unknown.
329,00:23:13,00:23:20,I ran them against the employees of Steve Anderson's computer company disgruntled and otherwise.
330,00:23:20,00:23:23,They belong to a Needra Fenway.
331,00:23:24,00:23:26,And who is Needra Fenway?
332,00:23:26,00:23:29,Steve Anderson's secretary.
333,00:23:31,00:23:33,"So, of course, I checked out herprinter."
334,00:23:33,00:23:39,"As I'm sure you know, all printers have their own unique signature."
335,00:23:45,00:23:46,These three...
336,00:23:46,00:23:53,tiny vertical dots from Needra's printer match the ransom note perfectly.
337,00:23:59,00:24:00,Thank you.
338,00:24:00,00:24:03,Thank you for coming in.
339,00:24:03,00:24:05,Anything I can do to help.
340,00:24:05,00:24:07,"You know, it's, it's just terrible what happened."
341,00:24:08,00:24:13,BRASS: Maybe you can explain why your printer was used to create the ransom note found in the Anderson home.
342,00:24:13,00:24:14,What?
343,00:24:14,00:24:17,We have evidence that this came from your printer.
344,00:24:17,00:24:20,There are 500 people who work in that office.
345,00:24:20,00:24:22,Anyone could have used my printer.
346,00:24:22,00:24:25,We also found a strand of hair.
347,00:24:25,00:24:28,Our lab has matched it to you.
348,00:24:28,00:24:29,From the Anderson home.
349,00:24:29,00:24:31,I'm Steven's secretary.I go there.
350,00:24:31,00:24:34,Do you go upstairs?
351,00:24:34,00:24:37,'Cause that's where we found this particular hair.
352,00:24:39,00:24:41,WILLOWS: You two were having an affair.
353,00:24:41,00:24:43,We ended it.
354,00:24:43,00:24:44,Because his wife got pregnant?
355,00:24:44,00:24:46,I'm not going down this road.
356,00:24:46,00:24:49,What? A new baby screw up the office romance?
357,00:24:49,00:24:50,"It was more than just an office romance, okay?"
358,00:24:51,00:24:52,Much more.
359,00:24:53,00:24:58,"WILLOWS: Well, a lot of women would understand if you went over there and... got rid of that baby."
360,00:24:58,00:25:01,Sure. Quickest way to end a guy's marriage.
361,00:25:01,00:25:03,"Okay, I need a lawyer.Is that it?"
362,00:25:03,00:25:05,Is that what you're saying here?
363,00:25:07,00:25:09,(sighing)
364,00:25:11,00:25:13,Are these your nylons?
365,00:25:13,00:25:16,I found these hidden in the back of Mr. Anderson's closet.
366,00:25:16,00:25:20,"So, did you come to him after you disposed of the baby and ask him to hide them for you?"
367,00:25:21,00:25:23,Talk to Steve.
368,00:25:26,00:25:29,Steve asked her to get out of an obligation of a newborn?
369,00:25:29,00:25:32,"Geez, haven't these people ever heard of divorce?"
370,00:25:35,00:25:38,Needra didn't kill Zack any more than I did.
371,00:25:38,00:25:41,How do you explain her hair in the baby's crib?
372,00:25:47,00:25:50,We broke up the day that I learned that Gwen was pregnant with Zack.
373,00:25:50,00:25:54,I loved Needra but I love my family more.
374,00:25:54,00:26:01,"Needra asked if she could see Zack, after he was born to help her kind of accept the reality."
375,00:26:01,00:26:06,"So, I had her in last Saturday to watch him sleep."
376,00:26:09,00:26:11,Gwen had the kids at skating.
377,00:26:11,00:26:15,Needra was out of the house in 15 minutes.
378,00:26:17,00:26:18,You don't believe me.
379,00:26:18,00:26:20,You've lied to me before.
380,00:26:20,00:26:24,About what? You told me that you opened that cola bottle the morning you reported Zack missing.
381,00:26:24,00:26:26,We had a test done.
382,00:26:26,00:26:33,You opened that bottle six hours before you said you did-- the night before-- somewhere around 11:00 P.M.
383,00:26:33,00:26:34,The lab is still testing it.
384,00:26:34,00:26:36,I also believe that you cut it with alcohol.
385,00:26:36,00:26:39,Rum and cola-- what does that prove?
386,00:26:39,00:26:41,Was Needra Fenway in your house that night?
387,00:26:41,00:26:43,Did you catch her suffocating your son?
388,00:26:43,00:26:45,(baby crying) What are you doing?
389,00:26:45,00:26:47,What have you done?
390,00:26:47,00:26:49,That's not how it happened.
391,00:26:49,00:26:52,"Well, why don't you tell me how it happened."
392,00:26:52,00:26:53,(glass shattering) (gasp)
393,00:26:53,00:26:55,"GWEN: Robbie, what did you do?"
394,00:26:55,00:26:56,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
395,00:26:56,00:26:57,"All right, I heard you."
396,00:26:57,00:27:01,Do we have to have this conversation right now?
397,00:27:01,00:27:02,Mr. Anderson?
398,00:27:02,00:27:04,What? Yeah.
399,00:27:04,00:27:05,I'm from theLas Vegas Post.
400,00:27:05,00:27:08,Comments about these pictures your secretary sold to theMidnight Informerthis afternoon?
401,00:27:12,00:27:13,Where did you get these?
402,00:27:13,00:27:14,The tabloid's web site.
403,00:27:14,00:27:17,Needra sold them to pay for her legal fees.
404,00:27:22,00:27:23,REPORTER: Mr. Anderson?
405,00:27:28,00:27:32,My only comment is that I love my wife very much.
406,00:27:38,00:27:40,REPORTER: Excuse me.
407,00:27:40,00:27:41,I'm from theLas Vegas Post.
408,00:27:41,00:27:43,May I ask you a few questions?
409,00:27:43,00:27:44,GWEN: No.
410,00:27:55,00:27:58,A wife kills her baby to get back at her husband over his affair.
411,00:27:58,00:27:59,Come on.
412,00:27:59,00:28:02,"Any woman would go after the husband, not the baby."
413,00:28:02,00:28:08,True. But in some instances women have been known to kill their children as a way to pay back a spouse.
414,00:28:08,00:28:14,Particularly if it's over an affair and particularly if the child was a male child.
415,00:28:14,00:28:16,"Well I don't buy it.I just don't buy it, Doctor."
416,00:28:16,00:28:18,She really loved that baby.
417,00:28:18,00:28:21,"Well, Catherine that's why she's in this much pain now."
418,00:28:21,00:28:24,"A guy cheats, but the wife commits murder."
419,00:28:24,00:28:28,How come moms always end up the bad guy with you Freud types?
420,00:28:28,00:28:31,That's because this mother is the bad guy.
421,00:28:31,00:28:35,CNN just dug up a 13-year-old charge against Gwen Anderson.I heard it on the car radio.
422,00:28:35,00:28:36,What kind of charge?
423,00:28:37,00:28:39,It's called shaken baby syndrome.
424,00:28:39,00:28:40,"The oldest boy, Tyler?"
425,00:28:40,00:28:44,When he was a newborn she shook him so hard they had to go to the hospital.
426,00:28:44,00:28:46,She shook the kid unconscious.
427,00:28:46,00:28:48,Is this authentic?
428,00:28:48,00:28:52,"Yeah, they were on the phone with the arresting officer from Oregon."
429,00:28:52,00:28:53,He faxed me this report.
430,00:28:53,00:28:55,Our grieving mother...her record for child abuse.
431,00:28:58,00:29:01,(crowd clamoring and camera shutters clicking)
432,00:29:01,00:29:03,MAN: Baby killer.
433,00:29:11,00:29:12,You should die.You call yourself a mother?
434,00:29:13,00:29:14,You're the worst.
435,00:29:14,00:29:16,MAN: Baby killer. Someone should take those other kids from you.
436,00:29:17,00:29:20,REPORTER: Did you kill Zachary over your husband's affair?
437,00:29:20,00:29:21,Did you act alone or did Tyler help?
438,00:29:21,00:29:23,WOMAN: Baby killer. Bitch.
439,00:29:23,00:29:24,You deserve to die.Gil Grissom.
440,00:29:24,00:29:26,You found the baby.
441,00:29:26,00:29:28,How hard is it for you to look at Gwen Anderson?
442,00:29:28,00:29:29,Let me tell you something.
443,00:29:29,00:29:30,People are presumed innocent...
444,00:29:30,00:29:34,innocent until a court of law can examine all the evidence and prove otherwise.
445,00:29:34,00:29:38,Until then everything else is...
446,00:29:39,00:29:40,gossip.
447,00:29:40,00:29:44,WOMAN: She deserves to be put in jail.Gil Grissom. Gil Grissom!
448,00:29:44,00:29:46,Ice.
449,00:29:46,00:29:47,I don't need this.
450,00:29:47,00:29:48,Just do it.
451,00:29:51,00:29:56,That was quite a speech you made out there but between you me and the water fountain...
452,00:29:56,00:29:58,you think that Gwen Anderson's innocent?
453,00:30:00,00:30:02,What? Are you changing teams now?
454,00:30:02,00:30:04,You've been her biggest supporter.
455,00:30:04,00:30:05,I still am.
456,00:30:05,00:30:09,I'm just... taking your temperature.
457,00:30:09,00:30:12,BRASS: Hey?
458,00:30:12,00:30:13,We're up.
459,00:30:15,00:30:16,You didn't answer my question.
460,00:30:17,00:30:19,You're right. I didn't.
461,00:30:19,00:30:21,(throws ice bag in trash can)
462,00:30:21,00:30:24,"I never meant to hurt Tyler, you have to understand."
463,00:30:24,00:30:25,You shook him unconscious.
464,00:30:25,00:30:27,He was choking.
465,00:30:27,00:30:28,All on his own?
466,00:30:28,00:30:31,ATTORNEY: Change your tone or I'll end this right now.
467,00:30:31,00:30:33,"Well, it's a legitimate question."
468,00:30:33,00:30:36,But I have to work on my tone.You're right.
469,00:30:36,00:30:37,Try again.
470,00:30:39,00:30:40,All on his own?
471,00:30:42,00:30:44,"Go ahead, Mrs. Anderson."
472,00:30:44,00:30:47,He had gotten food in his windpipe.
473,00:30:47,00:30:49,His face was... turning red.
474,00:30:49,00:30:50,Steve was at work.
475,00:30:50,00:31:00,"So, I, I patted him on his back and-and on...and on his stomach and finally, I turned him upside down and I started shaking him to get the food out..."
476,00:31:00,00:31:02,"to... to dislodge it, and I did."
477,00:31:03,00:31:05,"But I realized that I had hurt him, so I called 9-1-1."
478,00:31:05,00:31:08,She was a new mother 23 years old.
479,00:31:08,00:31:12,If she'd meant to harm her son why would she call 9-1-1?
480,00:31:12,00:31:16,Did the E.R. find proof that there was food lodged in Tyler's throat?
481,00:31:16,00:31:19,"No, that's why the police were called in."
482,00:31:19,00:31:25,And by the time my client went home and found the chewed food on the kitchen floor it was all too late.
483,00:31:25,00:31:26,She was branded.
484,00:31:26,00:31:29,It was a French fry he had grabbed from my plate.
485,00:31:29,00:31:36,LEWIS: As for the death of little Zachary my client categorically denies any involvement.
486,00:31:36,00:31:42,She's a victim of an intruder who entered her home and abducted and killed her child.
487,00:31:42,00:31:47,Thank you all for your continued efforts to find the real killer.
488,00:31:47,00:31:49,Did you know that your golf course paints its grass?
489,00:31:49,00:31:52,Excuse me?
490,00:31:52,00:31:54,It's actually a vegetable dye.
491,00:31:54,00:31:55,Biodegradable.
492,00:31:55,00:31:59,They've been using green dye on television tournaments for several years.
493,00:31:59,00:32:01,What's your point?
494,00:32:01,00:32:04,I found a pair of nylons in the back of your husband's closet.
495,00:32:04,00:32:10,"BRASS: We, uh we have a receipt that links them to your client."
496,00:32:10,00:32:16,GRISSOM: The exact same dye from the golf course where Zachary was laid to rest is on your nylons.
497,00:32:16,00:32:19,She belongs to the club.
498,00:32:19,00:32:21,Grass stains.
499,00:32:21,00:32:23,WILLOWS: But she doesn't play golf.
500,00:32:23,00:32:25,"Remember our conversation, Mrs. Anderson?"
501,00:32:26,00:32:27,It's not your game?
502,00:32:30,00:32:36,If you arrest her now...you have 48 hours to charge her.
503,00:32:36,00:32:39,You really want to show your hand at the arraignment?
504,00:32:42,00:32:45,We'll be in touch.
505,00:32:45,00:32:46,Look.
506,00:32:46,00:32:47,"Mommy, I want my Mommy.Hey."
507,00:32:47,00:32:50,"Can we just go, please? What's going on?"
508,00:32:50,00:32:52,Did you see that?
509,00:32:52,00:32:54,A mother repelled by her young.
510,00:32:54,00:32:57,She didn't seem like that type to me.
511,00:32:57,00:33:00,"All right, okay.Here, go to your brother."
512,00:33:00,00:33:01,I'll catch you later.
513,00:33:01,00:33:04,I want to hear that 9-1-1 tape.
514,00:33:04,00:33:05,Hi.Hey.
515,00:33:05,00:33:06,Grissom?
516,00:33:07,00:33:08,The Coroner's been trying to reach you.
517,00:33:08,00:33:10,Did he nail time of death?
518,00:33:10,00:33:12,"9:00 P.M., but, uh, there's something else."
519,00:33:12,00:33:15,He isolated the fiber found in Zachary Anderson's throat.
520,00:33:15,00:33:18,It's a flame-retardant material-- generic name's Metaramid.
521,00:33:18,00:33:23,From the baby's clothes? Fire-retardant infant's clothes are made out of vinyon.
522,00:33:23,00:33:26,The fiber found in Zack's throat is a stronger chemical treatment.
523,00:33:26,00:33:28,It's found in things that are made to be near fire and flames.
524,00:33:30,00:33:32,Hey?
525,00:33:32,00:33:35,"Hey, can I go with you?"
526,00:34:08,00:34:10,Same color as the fiber in Zack's throat.
527,00:34:17,00:34:21,"Okay, this is the 9-1-1 call from the Anderson house at 4:30 A.M."
528,00:34:21,00:34:22,STEVE: Our baby has been kidnapped.
529,00:34:22,00:34:23,493 Fairmark.
530,00:34:23,00:34:24,Please hurry.
531,00:34:24,00:34:26,Mrs. Anderson wasn't there?
532,00:34:27,00:34:32,You wouldn't think so but I went ahead and separated out any underlying voices.
533,00:34:32,00:34:34,GWEN: What are we going to do?!
534,00:34:34,00:34:36,"She was standing, like, two meters from the phone."
535,00:34:36,00:34:38,"Yeah, well, it's a legitimate comment."
536,00:34:38,00:34:40,Doesn't make her guilty of anything.
537,00:34:40,00:34:44,"I know, so I checked to see if she was, like, faking her concern."
538,00:34:44,00:34:48,This program measures the stress level of the speakers.
539,00:34:48,00:34:51,"GWEN: Oh, God, what are we going to do?!"
540,00:34:52,00:34:54,The stress is real.
541,00:34:54,00:34:56,Are you familiar with the JonBenet case?
542,00:34:56,00:34:59,A little.
543,00:34:59,00:35:06,"Well, the police went back, and they found an earlier call that was placed from the home to 9-1-1 and the audio tests separated out the son's voice."
544,00:35:06,00:35:09,"Now, I'm not saying that Tyler's our guy, but..."
545,00:35:09,00:35:11,we need to check into every avenue.
546,00:35:11,00:35:19,"Well, I did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the Anderson house-- from the land line, or from the cell phone."
547,00:35:19,00:35:23,"In the parents' name, but did you look under Tyler's?"
548,00:35:23,00:35:27,"I mean, a rich kid like that's probably got a cell phone."
549,00:35:27,00:35:29,"Yeah. All right, I'll get into it."
550,00:35:29,00:35:30,(phone ringing)
551,00:35:31,00:35:32,Hello.
552,00:35:32,00:35:34,"MAN: Anderson attorney, 7:00 A.M."
553,00:35:34,00:35:35,7:00 A.M.?
554,00:35:35,00:35:36,I'll be there.
555,00:35:36,00:35:37,All the evidence.
556,00:35:37,00:35:38,Yeah. I'll bring it all.
557,00:35:38,00:35:40,Thanks.
558,00:35:53,00:35:59,"LEWIS: My colleagues, Messrs. Landry and Frank are representing Steve and Tyler Anderson respectively."
559,00:35:59,00:36:07,Although we're not co-counsel in the strictest sense we've agreed the authorities should have no more than three questions to put to our clients each.
560,00:36:07,00:36:10,"After that, we'll accept written submissions only."
561,00:36:10,00:36:13,Nice... what money can buy.
562,00:36:13,00:36:17,"My family is done being railroaded by you people so just ask your questions, and let's go."
563,00:36:17,00:36:19,I don't have any questions.
564,00:36:19,00:36:23,We know what happened in your house the night Zachary died.
565,00:36:23,00:36:25,We've interpreted the evidence.
566,00:36:25,00:36:28,"WILLOWS: All right, let's work backwards starting with the cover-up."
567,00:36:28,00:36:36,Sometime around 11:00 P.M.the night of the kidnapping you and Mr. Anderson had a drink-- rum and cola...
568,00:36:40,00:36:45,and decided what to do with the body of Zachary.
569,00:36:47,00:36:52,We have yet to determine whether or not his death was accidental or intentional.
570,00:36:52,00:36:59,The Question Documents lab thinks that a parent wrote the ransom note because there's no money amount.
571,00:37:02,00:37:04,Too hard to put a price on your own son?
572,00:37:04,00:37:14,"Mrs. Anderson, while your husband was writing the ransom note, you wrapped Zachary's body in a blanket that you got from the upstairs linen closet."
573,00:37:18,00:37:22,You then laid his body to rest near a statue on the golf course.
574,00:37:26,00:37:30,(sobbing softly)
575,00:37:30,00:37:32,(crying)
576,00:37:33,00:37:37,That's how you got the grass stains on your nylons.
577,00:37:39,00:37:44,You put down a plastic bag from the pantry so that he'd remain dry.
578,00:37:44,00:37:47,Evidence of genuine care and concern.
579,00:37:47,00:37:51,And Mr. Anderson you put up a ladder outside the window.
580,00:37:51,00:37:58,The only shoe prints we found were yours and the gardener's and the gardener has been out of town.
581,00:37:58,00:38:10,You then drove over to your office and cranked off a ransom note on the first available printer possibly thinking that if you used a printer from outside your house we wouldn't be able to trace it.
582,00:38:10,00:38:11,But these three dots...
583,00:38:13,00:38:16,have given you away.
584,00:38:16,00:38:18,Thismayprove cover-up.
585,00:38:18,00:38:21,None of it proves they killed Zachary.
586,00:38:21,00:38:23,"You're right, Counselor."
587,00:38:23,00:38:26,Zachary's life was taken much earlier in the evening.
588,00:38:26,00:38:29,The coroner estimated time of death at 9:00 P.M.
589,00:38:30,00:38:31,LEWIS: Estimated.
590,00:38:31,00:38:34,It could be 8:30.
591,00:38:34,00:38:36,Yes.
592,00:38:36,00:38:40,While Robbie and Zachary were in Tyler's care.
593,00:38:43,00:38:44,You said we could ask three questions each.
594,00:38:45,00:38:48,Am I right? Stop.
595,00:38:48,00:38:49,Ty didn't do this.
596,00:38:49,00:38:50,LEWIS: Don't give them anything.
597,00:38:50,00:38:52,We're already ruined.
598,00:38:52,00:38:54,They're just...
599,00:38:54,00:38:56,They're just trying to protect me.
600,00:38:56,00:38:58,Please. And I can't go on.
601,00:38:58,00:39:00,Mrs. Anderson. I killed him.
602,00:39:00,00:39:01,I came home.
603,00:39:03,00:39:13,"Tyler h-h-hadn't put Zachary to bed because he he was crying, and I wanted to hush him up and, and I just, I went too far."
604,00:39:13,00:39:18,For the record my client made this statement against legal counsel.
605,00:39:18,00:39:23,Would you tell us...how you killed him.
606,00:39:23,00:39:27,I smothered him with a pot holder.
607,00:39:27,00:39:30,And that's when Steve and I came up with the kidnap story.
608,00:39:33,00:39:37,It was the longest night of our lives.
609,00:39:37,00:39:41,You had to wait till the morning to report him missing.
610,00:39:41,00:39:43,So that it wouldn't look suspicious.
611,00:39:45,00:39:48,"And you may not believe me, but I loved him."
612,00:39:48,00:39:50,"I loved him very, very much."
613,00:39:54,00:39:57,We're going to have to have them both arrested.
614,00:40:11,00:40:12,I'm just coming to meet you guys.
615,00:40:12,00:40:14,I thought you were at the Andersons.
616,00:40:14,00:40:15,She copped.
617,00:40:15,00:40:19,Guilty people do that when you corner them with evidence.
618,00:40:19,00:40:21,"Guys, the mother didn't do it."
619,00:40:21,00:40:23,What?
620,00:40:23,00:40:24,Listen.
621,00:40:29,00:40:33,"TYLER: What did you do, Robbie?!"
622,00:40:33,00:40:35,What did you do?!
623,00:40:36,00:40:39,I was watching the boys.
624,00:40:39,00:40:42,I had my eye on them; I did.
625,00:40:42,00:40:45,(baby cooing)
626,00:40:46,00:40:51,Yeah. But then you called your girlfriend.
627,00:40:51,00:40:53,And we got to talking.
628,00:40:55,00:40:59,And I was kind of ignoring Zack and Robbie.
629,00:41:00,00:41:03,They were being quiet.
630,00:41:03,00:41:05,They were behaving.
631,00:41:05,00:41:09,"I turned around, and I saw how still he was."
632,00:41:11,00:41:14,"I ran to him, and he was dead."
633,00:41:16,00:41:19,And that's when you called 9-1-1.
634,00:41:22,00:41:24,(beeping)
635,00:41:24,00:41:26,(audio indistinct)
636,00:41:26,00:41:31,But you must have dropped the phone to tend to Zack.
637,00:41:35,00:41:38,"TYLER: What did you do, Robbie?!"
638,00:41:38,00:41:39,What did you do?!
639,00:41:39,00:41:44,Then I guess somehow in the chaos you got disconnected.
640,00:41:46,00:41:49,"Soon after that, your parents arrived."
641,00:41:51,00:41:52,"GWEN: Oh, my God."
642,00:41:53,00:41:55,What happened?
643,00:41:55,00:41:59,One of you worked on him so hard that you cracked his sternum.
644,00:42:01,00:42:03,He was already blue.
645,00:42:06,00:42:08,I pushed.
646,00:42:08,00:42:13,"I tried to breathe air into him, but he was gone."
647,00:42:13,00:42:15,We did everything that we could.
648,00:42:15,00:42:18,Why didn't you just tell the truth?
649,00:42:18,00:42:20,We wanted to protect Robbie.
650,00:42:25,00:42:28,We didn't want him to grow up with the stigma of...
651,00:42:28,00:42:35,"""the boy who killed his brother."" He's three."
652,00:42:35,00:42:37,He's clinically unaware of his actions.
653,00:42:37,00:42:40,No court would hold him accountable for that.
654,00:42:40,00:42:43,But everybody else would know.
655,00:42:43,00:42:46,It would follow him the rest of his life.
656,00:42:46,00:42:56,And my wife...would rather go to prison than to have anybody know what Robbie did.
657,00:42:57,00:43:00,"Mr. Anderson, we won't let that happen."
658,00:43:24,00:43:31,Now I know why you didn't want to hold Robbie when your older son handed him to you outside the police department.
659,00:43:35,00:43:37,I'm very sorry.
660,00:43:37,00:43:39,(sniffling)
661,00:43:39,00:43:41,"I always, uh..."
662,00:43:41,00:43:48,"I always tell them, ""Gentle, gentle."" He didn't mean it."
663,00:43:48,00:43:49,I know he didn't mean it.
664,00:43:50,00:43:51,Of course he didn't.
665,00:44:04,00:44:07,You must think that we're awful people-- all the stuff that's come out.
666,00:44:08,00:44:14,You're an average family burdened with a tragedy that put you under a microscope.
667,00:44:14,00:44:17,"That close, nobody can look good."
668,00:44:26,00:44:29,Your family's waiting for you.
669,00:44:29,00:44:31,You ready?
