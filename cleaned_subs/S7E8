0	00:00:56	00:00:59	Mommy, up.
1	00:00:59	00:01:00	Up, Mommy, up.
2	00:01:00	00:01:02	Not now, baby, Mommy's busy.
3	00:01:02	00:01:03	Go find Daddy.
4	00:01:05	00:01:10	Aah...
5	00:01:10	00:01:13	Honey, I cannot find my navy suit.
6	00:01:13	00:01:14	Oh, I'm sorry, shoot.
7	00:01:14	00:01:20	I meant to get it this morning, but Henry was doing his ear-itchy thing, so I took him to Dr. Neilsen.
8	00:01:20	00:01:21	I'll get it first thing tomorrow.
9	00:01:21	00:01:23	Oh, I have an early meeting, sweetie.
10	00:01:23	00:01:24	So go get it.
11	00:01:24	00:01:27	Oh... all right.
12	00:01:27	00:01:30	Daddy, no leave. Daddy, no leave.
13	00:01:30	00:01:31	Aw... daddy no leave.
14	00:01:34	00:01:35	You give him a bath, I'll go.
15	00:01:37	00:01:41	Welcome to LVRP, Rat Pack Radio.
16	00:01:41	00:01:48	Here's an oldie but a goodie by two salty dogs of stage and screen, Bobby Darin and Johnny Mercer.
17	00:03:54	00:03:57	Bad day when you can't even run a simple errand.
18	00:03:57	00:03:59	Everybody's got dirty laundry.
19	00:03:59	00:04:01	Sometimes it gets you killed.
20	00:04:12	00:04:17	What would she have done if she didn't have a second story?
21	00:04:17	00:04:20	Every death has at least two stories.
22	00:05:06	00:05:09	Two GSWs to the chest.
23	00:05:09	00:05:10	Rigor hasn't set.
24	00:05:10	00:05:13	Probably been dead less than four hours. Thanks, David.
25	00:05:15	00:05:20	Mr. Chen works here alone with his wife, and English is not their first language.
26	00:05:21	00:05:30	I'm not even real sure that it's their second, but what I did gather is that the steam machines are very noisy, so neither one of them really heard anything.
27	00:05:30	00:05:34	Mr. Chen 00.
28	00:05:34	00:05:35	Said she's a regular customer.
29	00:05:35	00:05:40	Well, I got a phone and keys, but no purse.
30	00:05:40	00:05:41	Mugging?
31	00:05:41	00:05:43	Take the purse, leave the Lexus?
32	00:05:43	00:05:45	Yeah, that's not real savvy, is it? Hmm.
33	00:05:45	00:05:47	Car's been keyed.
34	00:05:57	00:06:00	Registered to a Dr. Gary Sinclair.
35	00:06:00	00:06:02	Yeah, that's gonna probably be the husband.
36	00:06:02	00:06:07	Gary Home has called her six times in the last hour.
37	00:06:09	00:06:12	Wife and mother.
38	00:06:12	00:06:15	I'll check the trash cans for the complex, see if I can find her purse.
39	00:06:15	00:06:18	Maybe they dumped what they couldn't liquidate.
40	00:06:18	00:06:21	Well, she obviously doesn't have any kids.
41	00:06:21	00:06:25	Place is like a museum.
42	00:06:25	00:06:28	This chick hung out with some big wigs.
43	00:06:28	00:06:30	She was a big wig.
44	00:06:30	00:06:33	Jill Case, Editor-in-Chief of the Las Vegas Globe.
45	00:06:33	00:06:36	She was a wunderkind.
46	00:06:36	00:06:38	One of the youngest women in history to run a newspaper.
47	00:06:38	00:06:40	Well, I've been all around the house, no sign of a forced entry.
48	00:06:40	00:06:42	Consistent with suicide.
49	00:06:42	00:06:44	So is this.
50	00:06:44	00:06:46	You can't even use a whole sheet of paper for your suicide note?
51	00:06:46	00:06:52	Well, I don't know, maybe if you feel like you don't deserve to take up space on the planet, you don't deserve a whole piece of paper.
52	00:06:52	00:06:53	She obviously ate at Joie de Vive.
53	00:06:54	00:06:56	It's the only place that still serves old school swan doggie bags.
54	00:06:56	00:06:59	Yeah, dressed in a fancy outfit, having a fancy meal.
55	00:06:59	00:07:04	If you're planning on killing yourself, why do you bring home a doggie bag?
56	00:07:04	00:07:06	It's human nature.
57	00:07:06	00:07:11	We continue to perform the routine motions of our life until the moment of our death.
58	00:08:48	00:08:52	DNA's been sent out, but this is one case where I don't need to wait for results.
59	00:08:57	00:08:58	Identical twins?
60	00:08:59	00:09:01	You got to be kidding me.
61	00:09:03	00:09:05	They're even wearing the same toenail polish.
62	00:09:05	00:09:06	And both...
63	00:09:06	00:09:10	wore the same watch, too.
64	00:09:10	00:09:12	Oh, it's just too much.
65	00:09:12	00:09:13	Well...
66	00:09:13	00:09:19	...eight year olds dressing alike I kind of get, but grown women? That's weird.
67	00:09:19	00:09:20	Some people like it.
68	00:09:21	00:09:22	I'm a twin.
69	00:09:22	00:09:24	Really? Well, I was.
70	00:09:24	00:09:25	My twin died in utero.
71	00:09:25	00:09:28	My mother didn't tell me about it until I was an adult.
72	00:09:28	00:09:32	When I decided to become a coroner, she blamed herself.
73	00:09:32	00:09:36	She said it was because I'd spent so many days living next to a dead body.
74	00:09:36	00:09:39	Well, speaking of dead bodies, uh... Right.
75	00:09:39	00:09:44	Right. Jill has petechia around the eyes, bruising around the neck, and a broken clavicle.
76	00:09:44	00:09:46	All consistent with a hanging.
77	00:09:46	00:09:50	And I extracted these from Amanda.
78	00:09:51	00:09:52	One went straight to the heart.
79	00:09:52	00:09:55	The other penetrated the right lung.
80	00:09:55	00:09:58	Sharp shooter or close range.
81	00:09:58	00:10:00	Don't tell me they died at the same moment. Not quite.
82	00:10:00	00:10:03	Amanda was a couple hours ahead of her sister.
83	00:10:31	00:10:32	Our two cases have become one.
84	00:10:32	00:10:34	Could still be two cases.
85	00:10:34	00:10:36	What happened to Mr. No-Such-Thing-As-Coincidence?
86	00:10:36	00:10:39	Simplest hypothesis is usually the correct one.
87	00:10:39	00:10:42	If you hear hooves, think horses not zebras.
88	00:10:42	00:10:44	What would the horses be in this case?
89	00:10:44	00:10:46	Murder/suicide.
90	00:10:48	00:10:51	Jill killed Amanda.
91	00:10:51	00:10:52	Felt guilty, then killed herself.
92	00:10:54	00:10:57	And, uh, what do you got to support that?
93	00:10:57	00:11:01	Did you notice any photos of Amanda or her family in Jill's house?
94	00:11:01	00:11:04	No. Right.
95	00:11:04	00:11:08	And I looked through Amanda's phone book, Jill was not even in it.
96	00:11:08	00:11:10	Well, maybe she had her number memorized.
97	00:11:10	00:11:13	Brass spoke with Jill's attorney for next of kin.
98	00:11:13	00:11:15	None existed.
99	00:11:15	00:11:18	She's leaving a small fortune to various charities.
100	00:11:18	00:11:20	It just sounds to me like estrangement.
101	00:11:20	00:11:26	Okay, even if that's not the exact way it went down, I'll bet you a dollar that the twins deaths are related.
102	00:11:26	00:11:31	Two women found dead on opposite sides of town.
103	00:11:31	00:11:36	If they didn't look alike, would you still link them?
104	00:11:36	00:11:37	If they're relatives, yes.
105	00:11:37	00:11:42	Sisters, husband and wife, father and son. Okay.
106	00:11:42	00:11:44	Okay, what?
107	00:11:44	00:11:46	I'll take the bet.
108	00:11:48	00:11:51	I must've called her ten times, then after about an hour I got so worried.
109	00:11:51	00:11:53	Did your wife have any enemies?
110	00:11:53	00:11:55	Anyone she was fighting with?
111	00:11:55	00:11:58	No, she was a good wife, great mother.
112	00:11:58	00:12:01	Home, Daddy, home. Okay, buddy. Can you-- hey, you know what?
113	00:12:02	00:12:06	Come over here. Can you come over here and draw your butterfly that you draw?
114	00:12:06	00:12:09	What was her relationship like with Jill?
115	00:12:10	00:12:12	Jill who?
116	00:12:12	00:12:15	Her twin sister, Jill Case.
117	00:12:15	00:12:17	Amanda didn't have a sister.
118	00:12:17	00:12:19	DNA tells us otherwise.
119	00:12:19	00:12:21	My wife was an only child.
120	00:12:23	00:12:25	Sh-she was adopted, but...
121	00:12:25	00:12:28	Is it possible that...
122	00:12:28	00:12:33	your wife knew she had a twin, but she hadn't told you? Well, I'd like to think no.
123	00:12:33	00:12:35	That we told each other everything.
124	00:12:35	00:12:37	But that's not... True?
125	00:12:38	00:12:40	A marriage.
126	00:12:41	00:12:42	Married, Detective?
127	00:12:42	00:12:44	No.
128	00:12:45	00:12:50	Something weird happens between two people who know each other for years, see each other every day.
129	00:12:51	00:12:56	Every night I drive home from the hospital and I think of 12 things I want to tell Amanda.
130	00:12:56	00:12:59	And then I get home and, uh... she's cooking.
131	00:13:00	00:13:03	And we read stories to Henry and then...
132	00:13:03	00:13:07	the phone rings, so I-- you know, you say, Oh, I'll just tell her tomorrow. Tomorrow.
133	00:13:09	00:13:10	I'd like to meet her.
134	00:13:10	00:13:13	Jill.
135	00:13:13	00:13:16	I'm sorry that's...
136	00:13:16	00:13:20	that's not possible. We found them both...
137	00:13:20	00:13:22	last night.
138	00:13:22	00:13:24	What happened?
139	00:13:24	00:13:28	Right now...
140	00:13:28	00:13:30	we don't know.
141	00:13:30	00:13:31	It's okay, Daddy.
142	00:13:31	00:13:33	Let's go home and see Mommy.
143	00:13:33	00:13:35	Okay.
144	00:14:22	00:14:25	Hey. I got your text.
145	00:14:25	00:14:26	What's up?
146	00:14:26	00:14:28	Sing it, dude. This is huge.
147	00:14:28	00:14:31	Oh...
148	00:14:53	00:14:58	Okay. I got a hit off of that envelope you found in Amanda's purse.
149	00:14:58	00:15:00	It's a Dora Pomerantz.
150	00:15:00	00:15:01	Oh, that would make sense.
151	00:15:01	00:15:03	The letter was signed Dora.
152	00:15:03	00:15:04	Do you wanna know why she's in the system?
153	00:15:09	00:15:12	Mrs. Pomerantz?
154	00:15:12	00:15:13	Who wants to know?
155	00:15:13	00:15:16	Detective Curtis and CSI Nick Stokes.
156	00:15:16	00:15:18	Hi. We just need to ask you a few questions.
157	00:15:19	00:15:20	About what?
158	00:15:20	00:15:22	Your twins.
159	00:15:25	00:15:27	That was a very long time ago.
160	00:15:28	00:15:33	We were just curious about the circumstances under which they were adopted.
161	00:15:33	00:15:37	I was 18 years old when I got pregnant.
162	00:15:38	00:15:40	Charlie said he'd stay with me.
163	00:15:40	00:15:42	Then he got drafted to Vietnam.
164	00:15:43	00:15:46	Came home six months later... in a box.
165	00:15:48	00:15:50	These two chirping birds.
166	00:15:50	00:15:52	Waa, waa, waa.
167	00:15:52	00:15:54	I couldn't get them to stop.
168	00:15:54	00:15:56	I couldn't take it.
169	00:15:56	00:15:58	So one day I just...
170	00:15:58	00:16:00	Boop... snapped.
171	00:16:02	00:16:05	That was it. No more babies.
172	00:16:05	00:16:08	I spent ten years in a state facility, you know?
173	00:16:08	00:16:11	We were aware.
174	00:16:11	00:16:13	How have you been since?
175	00:16:13	00:16:15	Oh... fine.
176	00:16:15	00:16:19	A smart doctor put me in touch with an equine assisted therapy program.
177	00:16:20	00:16:22	Saved my life.
178	00:16:22	00:16:25	Horses don't have judgments.
179	00:16:25	00:16:27	They have needs. Meet the needs, the horse is happy.
180	00:16:31	00:16:33	Helped retrain my brain.
181	00:16:33	00:16:35	Healthy enough to get back in touch with your daughters?
182	00:16:37	00:16:40	Oh, no. Uh...
183	00:16:40	00:16:42	not recommended.
184	00:16:42	00:16:44	Sometimes you just can't go back.
185	00:16:44	00:16:50	Is that why you wrote Amanda this letter saying, Please do not ever contact me again?
186	00:16:50	00:16:51	Who's Amanda?
187	00:16:52	00:16:54	One of your daughters.
188	00:16:54	00:16:56	We keep envelopes loose in a desk drawer.
189	00:16:56	00:16:58	I must've touched it before she sent it.
190	00:16:58	00:17:01	Who? The handwriting, it's Tiffany's.
191	00:17:01	00:17:04	I'm sorry. Who's Tiffany?
192	00:17:04	00:17:08	I had no idea my mom had given up a kid.
193	00:17:08	00:17:12	But I did know that there was no way she could handle dealing with it.
194	00:17:13	00:17:15	So... you always go through your mom's mail?
195	00:17:15	00:17:19	Yeah. My dad and I have a system.
196	00:17:19	00:17:21	We screen all her mail.
197	00:17:21	00:17:23	Why's that?
198	00:17:23	00:17:24	She's got this problem.
199	00:17:24	00:17:30	Any time a children's charity solicitation comes, she donates and not just a little.
200	00:17:30	00:17:34	Half my college fund was gone before we realized what was going on.
201	00:17:34	00:17:36	So you thought Amanda had her hand out?
202	00:17:36	00:17:38	Wasn't worth the risk.
203	00:17:41	00:17:46	The anti-depressants and the horses help, but my mom's barely hanging on.
204	00:17:46	00:17:49	And I only have a year left before I go to college.
205	00:17:49	00:17:52	I just need her to hang on one more year.
206	00:17:52	00:17:55	So, I sent the polite response and hoped it was over.
207	00:17:55	00:17:58	Did Jill ever try to contact your mom?
208	00:17:58	00:17:59	Who's Jill?
209	00:18:05	00:18:07	So I got bad news and weird news.
210	00:18:07	00:18:08	Which would you like to hear first?
211	00:18:10	00:18:13	I got nothing from the blue stocking that was found in the trash.
212	00:18:13	00:18:20	I tested the red lipstick on Gary Sinclair's collar and I got DNA, but it wasn't his wife's.
213	00:18:20	00:18:23	Well, based on the contents of her purse, she's more the lip balm type.
214	00:18:24	00:18:30	You know I like to be thorough, so... I ran it through CODIS Natal Peled.
215	00:18:30	00:18:32	She's in the system from a rape charge in L.A.
216	00:18:32	00:18:34	They don't put victim's DNA in the database.
217	00:18:34	00:18:35	No, they don't.
218	00:18:36	00:18:42	Yeah, I had to know, so I called a friend of mine at L.A. Sheriff's Department, and apparently, Natal was a nurse at a Hollywood hospital.
219	00:18:42	00:18:49	And she went to the annual Christmas party, she fed this doctor a bunch of cocktails, slipped him a Viagra, and then took him up to a hotel room.
220	00:18:49	00:18:54	And rumor has it, it was in order to have unprotected, you know... baby-making sex.
221	00:18:54	00:18:58	So he pressed charges, she was arrested, and then they settled out of court.
222	00:18:58	00:19:01	And now Natal's a nurse at our very own Dessert Palm.
223	00:19:01	00:19:06	With Amanda's husband, Dr. Gary Sinclair.
224	00:19:06	00:19:08	Doctors have a name for what Natal is.
225	00:19:08	00:19:09	What she is?
226	00:19:09	00:19:12	A woman who trolls hospitals looking to land themselves a doctor.
227	00:19:14	00:19:16	shiny, full of crap, and... best when dumped.
228	00:19:16	00:19:18	Of course we slept together.
229	00:19:19	00:19:21	Who wouldn't want to get with this?
230	00:19:22	00:19:25	Of course he's gonna deny it because of that little wife of his.
231	00:19:25	00:19:27	So you met his wife, Amanda?
232	00:19:27	00:19:30	Please. Yes, I've met her.
233	00:19:30	00:19:33	Always coming by the hospital, check up on him.
234	00:19:33	00:19:34	Talk about paranoid.
235	00:19:34	00:19:36	Hey, with you around...
236	00:19:36	00:19:38	sounds like she had pretty good reason.
237	00:19:38	00:19:40	Mr. Stokes...
238	00:19:41	00:19:47	men are like tigers-- if you can't tame them, you must let them roam free.
239	00:19:49	00:19:50	I go now, yeah?
240	00:20:00	00:20:05	Yes. It seems that the paint on the Sabra's key is consistent with Lexus factory issue.
241	00:20:05	00:20:08	Color's Galactic Grey Mica IE9.
242	00:20:08	00:20:09	Same as Amanda's.
243	00:20:10	00:20:14	So... crazy chick keys the wife's car.
244	00:20:14	00:20:20	Is it gateway violence that led to murder, or just another coincidence like everything else in this case?
245	00:20:20	00:20:22	I almost keyed a car once.
246	00:20:24	00:20:25	You what?
247	00:20:25	00:20:28	I know, but, in the end, I couldn't go through with it.
248	00:20:31	00:20:34	So I peed on the door handles instead.
249	00:20:35	00:20:37	So they'd freeze up and can't get them open?
250	00:20:38	00:20:41	No. It was San Diego.
251	00:20:41	00:20:43	Over a girl?
252	00:20:43	00:20:46	Over a B.
253	00:20:46	00:20:48	Professor gave me one on my term paper.
254	00:20:48	00:20:49	I felt I deserved an A.
255	00:20:54	00:20:58	So she definitely keyed the car, and may or may not have been doing the husband.
256	00:20:58	00:20:59	I'm going with yes.
257	00:20:59	00:21:02	Ballistics came back on the bullets that killed Amanda.
258	00:21:02	00:21:09	There's only one gun with a six right polygonal barrel A Baby Eagle-- Israeli military issue.
259	00:21:09	00:21:12	Israeli guns are really hard to find.
260	00:21:12	00:21:15	Unless you served in the Israeli army like Natal.
261	00:21:15	00:21:20	Okay. Okay, I certainly wouldn't put it past her, but what about the husband?
262	00:21:20	00:21:22	Classic he said, she said.
263	00:21:22	00:21:30	They're either acting in cahoots, trying to confuse us, or Natal is acting on her own, thinking that the wife is the obstacle standing between them.
264	00:21:30	00:21:35	Nothing quite says I love you like, I killed your wife so we can be together.
265	00:21:35	00:21:39	Sir, we have a warrant to search the premises, and we need you to come down to the station.
266	00:21:39	00:21:44	If you can't make arrangements for your child, we have a Child Services Advocate who can take him.
267	00:21:44	00:21:45	This is ridiculous.
268	00:21:45	00:21:46	I've been nothing but cooperative.
269	00:21:46	00:21:48	You harass me at my place of work.
270	00:21:48	00:21:50	You harass me at my home.
271	00:21:50	00:21:51	Now you want to take my kid away?
272	00:21:51	00:21:54	Sir, are you resisting?
273	00:21:54	00:21:56	I didn't kill my wife.
274	00:21:56	00:21:58	I was giving my son a bath.
275	00:21:58	00:21:59	I couldn't have done it.
276	00:22:02	00:22:06	Can I at least put my shoes on?
277	00:22:51	00:22:52	What have you got?
278	00:22:52	00:22:55	A smoking gun.
279	00:22:58	00:23:00	You're not going to like the answer.
280	00:23:00	00:23:03	The DNA on the cigarette butts doesn't match Natal.
281	00:23:03	00:23:05	Come on.
282	00:23:05	00:23:07	You can't tell me we're back to square one on this deal.
283	00:23:07	00:23:08	Well, we're not.
284	00:23:08	00:23:13	DNA was female, so I ran it against Amanda, thinking, I don't know, maybe she takes super-secret cigarette breaks.
285	00:23:13	00:23:17	And it wasn't a match, but they do have seven loci in common.
286	00:23:17	00:23:19	So, is there another sister maybe?
287	00:23:22	00:23:23	Tiffany.
288	00:23:23	00:23:26	I'm confused.
289	00:23:26	00:23:28	This is 'cause I was smoking?
290	00:23:28	00:23:34	Well, no, smoking is bad for you, but, no, this is really more about where you were smoking.
291	00:23:34	00:23:44	I'm an only child who lives on a horse farm in the middle of nowhere with a horse- whispering mother and a dad who works all the time to avoid her.
292	00:23:45	00:23:48	When Amanda's letter came...
293	00:23:48	00:23:54	I was so excited at the idea of having a sister.
294	00:23:54	00:23:56	I was jumping out of my skin.
295	00:23:56	00:24:00	So I told my mom I joined cheerleading.
296	00:24:00	00:24:03	And after school, I would...
297	00:24:03	00:24:05	You'd what?
298	00:24:05	00:24:08	It started where I would just drive by.
299	00:24:08	00:24:11	And then it escalated?
300	00:24:11	00:24:14	Well...
301	00:24:14	00:24:18	once, I saw her in the yard, playing with her little boy.
302	00:24:18	00:24:21	So I started parking out front.
303	00:24:24	00:24:25	Hoping to see her again.
304	00:24:25	00:24:31	Basically, I would just sit there, imagining her in my life.
305	00:24:31	00:24:32	She'd make me tea.
306	00:24:32	00:24:38	And we'd go over my college applications and talk about boys.
307	00:24:38	00:24:41	It was like a TV commercial.
308	00:24:41	00:24:42	And then what?
309	00:24:42	00:24:45	Did your...
310	00:24:45	00:24:47	curiosity...
311	00:24:47	00:24:49	become an obsession?
312	00:24:49	00:24:52	Oh, my God.
313	00:24:52	00:24:54	No.
314	00:24:54	00:24:58	I could barely get up the courage to introduce myself.
315	00:24:58	00:25:01	That's why I'd just sit there smoking.
316	00:25:02	00:25:05	And then my stomach would hurt, so I would just drive home.
317	00:25:08	00:25:09	And now, I'll never get the chance.
318	00:26:38	00:26:39	Hey, Grissom said you might need some help.
319	00:26:43	00:26:45	What?
320	00:26:45	00:26:47	I don't know, you don't look like you've been put through the ringer.
321	00:26:47	00:26:50	Well, I guess the inquest was the easy part.
322	00:26:50	00:26:52	Now the kid's family wants to sue me.
323	00:26:52	00:26:54	Know any good lawyers?
324	00:26:54	00:26:56	I hate lawyers.
325	00:26:56	00:26:57	Want to take the bathroom?
326	00:26:57	00:26:58	Sure.
327	00:27:07	00:27:09	I found her naughty drawer.
328	00:27:09	00:27:11	My favorite part of any bedroom search.
329	00:27:11	00:27:14	I don't believe these girls anymore.
330	00:27:19	00:27:22	Looks like someone's been elevated to drawer status.
331	00:27:22	00:27:26	Well, apparently, love can't cure all that ails.
332	00:27:26	00:27:32	Alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam and sertraline-- all in her medicine cabinet.
333	00:27:32	00:27:36	Well, I said dude had a drawer, I didn't say it was love.
334	00:27:36	00:27:43	She had OCD-related depression, which is very deceiving because the sufferers are high functioning.
335	00:27:43	00:27:47	It's not your usual, you know, lie on the couch and listen to the Beatles kind of depression.
336	00:27:47	00:27:49	Did she ever talk about family?
337	00:27:49	00:27:52	You know, when a patient dies, the doctor-patient confidentiality clause is void.
338	00:27:52	00:27:54	But I'm just sort of feeling a little uncomfortable.
339	00:27:54	00:27:56	Do I have to...
340	00:27:57	00:27:58	call a lawyer?
341	00:27:58	00:28:01	It's entirely your choice.
342	00:28:01	00:28:05	We can subpoena her records, or you and I can talk.
343	00:28:05	00:28:07	Okay.
344	00:28:07	00:28:13	All she would say was that she didn't get along with her parents, and that, um, you know, relationships in general were difficult.
345	00:28:13	00:28:18	I mean, her condition made her excel professionally but flop personally.
346	00:28:18	00:28:22	We, uh, checked her records.
347	00:28:22	00:28:24	She was adopted as an infant.
348	00:28:24	00:28:26	Her parents never told her.
349	00:28:27	00:28:28	Huh.
350	00:28:28	00:28:35	Well, that explains her abandonment-attachment issues, and why she always felt like a square peg in a round family.
351	00:28:35	00:28:37	Did you believe she was suicidal?
352	00:28:37	00:28:41	Off the record, no, I don't. I don't think she was suicidal, I thought, I actually thought she was getting better.
353	00:28:41	00:28:48	So then how does an attractive, successful 36-year-old woman hang herself from her own balcony?
354	00:28:48	00:28:49	'Cause the choice was there.
355	00:28:49	00:28:59	At the end of the day, when an obsessive brain is presented with a choice, it just, sometimes, it just can't shut off the clatter of the idea until it sees it through to conclusion.
356	00:28:59	00:29:01	The idea found its way in.
357	00:29:04	00:29:07	It wasn't suicide.
358	00:29:07	00:29:09	These bruises developed postmortem.
359	00:29:09	00:29:14	Two on the front, eight on the back.
360	00:29:14	00:29:16	Strangulation.
361	00:29:18	00:29:19	Murder.
362	00:29:41	00:29:44	No, she missed the morning news meeting, all the section editors are biting my head off.
363	00:29:44	00:29:46	Look, I don't have a straight answer for you.
364	00:29:46	00:29:47	No, I've called, I've e-mailed, I've texted.
365	00:29:47	00:29:50	She'd have to be lying dead in a ditch not to answer her phone.
366	00:29:50	00:29:52	I know. Bye.
367	00:29:52	00:29:53	Can I help you?
368	00:29:53	00:29:55	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
369	00:29:55	00:29:57	This is Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.
370	00:29:57	00:30:00	We have a warrant to search Jill Case's office.
371	00:30:00	00:30:02	Okay, is she in some kind of trouble?
372	00:30:02	00:30:04	Well, it wasn't a ditch.
373	00:30:04	00:30:07	Oh, my God.
374	00:30:07	00:30:08	I...
375	00:30:08	00:30:10	God.
376	00:30:10	00:30:11	What's going on?
377	00:30:11	00:30:13	Back off. Get away.
378	00:30:13	00:30:15	All of you, go! Go!
379	00:30:16	00:30:18	Look, you can't drop a hot one in a room full of vultures.
380	00:30:18	00:30:19	They smell blood.
381	00:30:20	00:30:22	Half of them were wanting to pry her ass out of that chair for months.
382	00:30:22	00:30:26	I'll need a list of all the employees who work for the paper-- can you provide that?
383	00:30:26	00:30:28	I don't have access to that kind of information.
384	00:30:28	00:30:29	You're gonna have to go down to Human Resources.
385	00:30:29	00:30:31	Human Resources. Okay.
386	00:30:31	00:30:33	You're on your own.
387	00:30:33	00:30:36	I'll be taking a look inside her office, okay?
388	00:30:46	00:30:48	Did Jill have a computer?
389	00:30:48	00:30:50	Yeah, her laptop, of course.
390	00:30:50	00:30:51	It was like an extra limb.
391	00:31:06	00:31:08	What's with the locked drawer?
392	00:31:08	00:31:09	That was a new thing.
393	00:31:09	00:31:16	She's always been neurotic, but lately she's been secretive, like sneaky-- rolling her own calls, making her own appointments, talking with editors from other newspapers.
394	00:31:16	00:31:19	Honestly, I just thought she was looking for another job.
395	00:31:39	00:31:41	Did you ever try to open this drawer?
396	00:31:42	00:31:42	Are you kidding?
397	00:31:43	00:31:46	She had the only key, and protecting her privacy was how I kept my job.
398	00:31:47	00:31:52	Because Amanda's murder is still unsolved, I cross-checked the twins' address books.
399	00:31:52	00:31:54	Now, they have no contacts in common, but...
400	00:31:55	00:31:57	there are a couple freaky things.
401	00:31:57	00:32:04	So Amanda was set to pick up dry cleaning in the morning, but it looks as though she had a sick child, so she went at night instead.
402	00:32:04	00:32:05	Right.
403	00:32:05	00:32:11	And if she'd gone earlier than she was supposed to, she might've run into Jill, who was scheduled to pick up 30 in the morning.
404	00:32:12	00:32:13	But it gets better.
405	00:32:13	00:32:29	Based on receipts from Amanda's planner and Quicken listings from Jill's Treo, they used the same dry cleaner, same car dealership, they both had a weakness for the same frozen yogurt and blended mochas, and in two weeks, Jill was scheduled to teach a university extension class in photography.
406	00:32:29	00:32:31	Guess who was signed up to take the class?
407	00:32:31	00:32:34	Amanda.
408	00:32:34	00:32:35	Huh.
409	00:32:35	00:32:36	They would've finally met.
410	00:32:37	00:32:42	So having the same toe nail polish and watch made sense when we thought they knew each other, but now?
411	00:32:42	00:32:47	I mean, they even have almost the same handwriting.
412	00:32:47	00:32:54	Well, people's first explanation with twins is always parapsychology, but the truth is, there's a lot of biological encoding at work.
413	00:32:54	00:33:02	I mean, if you have the same musculature and bone structure in your hand, the chance of writing the same is not out of the question.
414	00:33:02	00:33:09	If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you both see with the same eyes or taste with the same tongue...
415	00:33:09	00:33:13	Well, I don't know whose eyes she was using for this guy.
416	00:33:13	00:33:17	Jill was scheduled to have dinner at Joie de Vive on the night she died.
417	00:33:17	00:33:19	So Warrick called over and got the surveillance footage.
418	00:33:19	00:33:21	I don't have an ID yet.
419	00:33:21	00:33:23	I do.
420	00:33:23	00:33:27	Her relationship with me was the most intimate she's ever had.
421	00:33:27	00:33:29	I actually felt like we were making progress.
422	00:33:29	00:33:30	Until the murder.
423	00:33:30	00:33:31	What are you talking about?
424	00:33:31	00:33:33	She committed suicide.
425	00:33:33	00:33:37	Did I tell you that? What are-- What are you suggesting, that I murdered my own patient?
426	00:33:37	00:33:38	Let me run down the sequence of events.
427	00:33:38	00:33:40	So you took your girlfriend out to dinner.
428	00:33:40	00:33:44	Then you brought her home for a little tie me up, tie me down.
429	00:33:45	00:33:50	But things get wonky and in the throes of passion, you remembered, Wait a minute, she's a patient.
430	00:33:50	00:33:52	Uh-oh.
431	00:33:52	00:33:54	So she had a history of depression.
432	00:33:54	00:33:56	So you used that knowledge to cover it up.
433	00:33:56	00:33:59	Well, we did go to dinner that night, but afterwards I dropped her off.
434	00:33:59	00:34:00	Because she said she had to work to do.
435	00:34:00	00:34:05	I didn't even go inside, so I don't even understand your question. Are you saying the two of you never had rough sex?
436	00:34:05	00:34:06	Now, be careful here, doctor.
437	00:34:12	00:34:21	Yeah, It's true that, in the past, we engaged in some, you know, some, uh, role playing sex games to help get her comfortable, but...
438	00:34:21	00:34:22	But what?
439	00:34:22	00:34:26	She was the S. I was the M.
440	00:34:31	00:34:32	Hey, um...
441	00:34:33	00:34:37	you know, how we thought that the shrink was a slam dunk for Jill's strangulation-hanging-combo?
442	00:34:37	00:34:40	Yeah. Well, I ran his DNA against the epithelials we found on the leash.
443	00:34:40	00:34:43	And the epithelials are male, but they're not his.
444	00:34:45	00:34:46	Thanks.
445	00:34:49	00:34:52	News on our case... The shrink might not have done it?
446	00:34:52	00:34:53	How did you know?
447	00:34:53	00:34:55	Because Archie found us another strong suspect.
448	00:34:56	00:35:04	You know, that flash drive that I found in the locked drawer in Jill Case's office, I thought it was just a bunch of photos but it turns out there was a little bit more than meets the eye.
449	00:35:04	00:35:06	You mean the flash drive was a Transformer?
450	00:35:06	00:35:09	No. Well, the pictures kind of were.
451	00:35:09	00:35:11	Check it out.
452	00:35:11	00:35:16	Look familiar? This got bought by the A.P. It was on the front page of the Las Vegas Globe.
453	00:35:16	00:35:17	It won a Pulitzer.
454	00:35:17	00:35:19	It was everywhere. Okay. So what?
455	00:35:19	00:35:23	These are Jake Lenoir's photographs taken in Iraq last summer.
456	00:35:28	00:35:30	Watch this.
457	00:35:35	00:35:39	The front page news was actually a composite?
458	00:35:39	00:35:41	Well, it's a... essentially an art project.
459	00:35:41	00:35:43	And Jill printed it.
460	00:35:43	00:35:45	I assume she didn't realize it until it was too late.
461	00:35:45	00:35:48	And before she died, she was trying to figure out how to handle it.
462	00:35:48	00:35:54	The only thing standing between Jake and the rest of his career was the truth.
463	00:35:54	00:35:56	And Jill Case.
464	00:35:58	00:35:59	Well, must be fun to be you.
465	00:35:59	00:36:06	Got a job that takes you around the world, get to meet some great girls, even win some awards.
466	00:36:06	00:36:13	So why would an adrenaline junkie like you, waste his time with Photoshopping?
467	00:36:13	00:36:20	Let me tell you something that the, um... newspapers, TV stations don't want to hear.
468	00:36:20	00:36:23	There's nothing over there to photograph.
469	00:36:23	00:36:25	Insurgents?
470	00:36:25	00:36:28	They fire off their outdated weapons, then run the other way.
471	00:36:28	00:36:31	When we do midnight raids in the villages, you know what the people tell us?
472	00:36:31	00:36:33	AliBaba not here.
473	00:36:33	00:36:36	We are fighting a fictional character.
474	00:36:36	00:36:44	And you got thousands of soldiers over there, kids, 18 years old, pumped up on testosterone, full of nicotine, and caffeine, waiting for something to bloody well happen.
475	00:36:44	00:36:46	And you know what?
476	00:36:46	00:36:49	You pray for a roadside bomb because it feels like action.
477	00:36:49	00:36:52	But you can't photograph the taste of gasoline.
478	00:36:52	00:36:54	It just looks like smoke.
479	00:36:55	00:36:57	So one day, yeah, I'm screwing around on my computer.
480	00:36:58	00:37:00	Couple of soldiers come by, took a look at what I'm doing.
481	00:37:00	00:37:01	You know what they say?
482	00:37:01	00:37:04	They say, Yeah, yeah, that's our war.
483	00:37:04	00:37:07	That's what it's like waiting and bodyhauling.
484	00:37:07	00:37:11	So I had it. I had the image that said it all.
485	00:37:11	00:37:15	So yes, I used a lie to tell the truth.
486	00:37:15	00:37:17	Well, thanks for the insight.
487	00:37:17	00:37:20	But I'm looking for another kind of confession.
488	00:37:20	00:37:23	I'm here to bust you for the murder of Jill Case.
489	00:37:23	00:37:24	What?
490	00:37:24	00:37:28	Come on, she was hip to your, uh, you know cut and paste scheme and she was going to blow the whistle on you.
491	00:37:28	00:37:32	Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I heard she committed suicide and look-- Oh, is that what you heard? Yeah.
492	00:37:32	00:37:35	Me and her, we-we had a history, okay. We dated.
493	00:37:35	00:37:39	But if she felt like outing me for this all I had to do was accuse her of sexual harassment and we both go down.
494	00:37:39	00:37:43	Maybe ethical journalism was worth the price for her.
495	00:37:43	00:37:44	Doubtful.
496	00:37:44	00:37:45	Without her job, she had nothing.
497	00:37:45	00:37:47	Well, for a while, she had you.
498	00:37:47	00:37:48	Yeah, but not for long.
499	00:37:48	00:37:50	Bird was rigid in everything she did.
500	00:37:50	00:37:54	Having sex with her was like... eating glass.
501	00:37:54	00:37:57	The lab did a DNA test.
502	00:37:57	00:38:01	Your skin cells are all over the dog leash that was used to hang her.
503	00:38:02	00:38:04	Well, I was probably the last person to actually walk that dog.
504	00:38:04	00:38:07	God knows she never did.
505	00:38:12	00:38:16	Guess this is more like his crash pad between foreign assignments.
506	00:38:16	00:38:21	I'm sorry, I just don't see Miss Neat Knickers and this guy making it as a couple, you know.
507	00:38:33	00:38:35	Still no laptop.
508	00:38:37	00:38:39	Steal it, scrub it and lose it.
509	00:38:39	00:38:41	This guy's smart.
510	00:38:41	00:38:43	This is all just circumstantial.
511	00:38:47	00:38:51	Now we know how he got her to write the suicide note.
512	00:38:51	00:38:53	She wasn't sorry to be living.
513	00:38:54	00:38:56	She was sorry that Jake was such a liar.
514	00:38:56	00:38:58	Well, this is more like what we need.
515	00:39:07	00:39:08	Warrick.
516	00:39:09	00:39:12	Didn't Nick's case have a blue thigh high stocking?
517	00:39:13	00:39:16	Yeah.
518	00:39:28	00:39:34	Even if he was the one that strangled Jill, there was no blood at the crime scene.
519	00:39:34	00:39:39	Well, with two gunshots to the chest, Jill's twin sister was a bloody mess.
520	00:39:49	00:39:50	Checkmate?
521	00:39:51	00:39:54	So he killed them both.
522	00:39:55	00:39:58	You must have thought you were losing your mind?
523	00:39:58	00:40:00	Let me run it for you.
524	00:40:00	00:40:03	Jill always picked up her dry cleaning on Thursday nights.
525	00:40:03	00:40:12	So right place, right time, right car, looks like the right woman, You thought it was done.
526	00:40:12	00:40:19	So you go to the house, get the computer files and you think you're seeing your conscious walk through the door.
527	00:40:40	00:40:42	The first time you had a plan.
528	00:40:42	00:40:44	Make it look like a mugging.
529	00:40:44	00:40:48	The second time, you had to improvise.
530	00:40:53	00:40:55	So there were two of them.
531	00:40:58	00:41:00	I dated Jill.
532	00:41:00	00:41:04	She kept the most rigid schedule of anyone I've ever met, you know.
533	00:41:04	00:41:06	It was always Thursday night pick up the dry cleaning night.
534	00:41:06	00:41:11	And I mean, God forbid I wanted to see a movie or catch a show or something.
535	00:41:11	00:41:13	Leave it to Jill to be so thorough.
536	00:41:15	00:41:17	Makes me have to kill her twice.
537	00:41:31	00:41:32	We were both right.
538	00:41:34	00:41:37	That's a federal offense, you know.
539	00:41:51	00:41:53	I heard the guys solved a double murder.
540	00:41:53	00:41:54	Mm-hmm.
541	00:41:54	00:41:59	I spent the day sitting on a bench outside the courtroom, they never got to me.
542	00:41:59	00:42:01	That sucks.
543	00:42:01	00:42:03	Feeling transcendental?
544	00:42:04	00:42:05	Hmm?
545	00:42:05	00:42:08	Thoreau. I, uh, I haven't read him since college.
546	00:42:08	00:42:11	Me, neither. It holds up.
547	00:42:11	00:42:16	I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion.
548	00:42:18	00:42:22	Oh, look, you missed one.
549	00:42:22	00:42:24	Sixty-three down.
550	00:42:24	00:42:25	Misanthrope.
551	00:42:30	00:42:33	I won't wait up.
