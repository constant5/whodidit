13,00:00:39,00:00:40,What are you looking at?
14,00:00:40,00:00:42,The view. Oh.
15,00:00:42,00:00:44,Never seen the city from this perspective before.
16,00:00:44,00:00:45,It's beautiful.
17,00:00:45,00:00:47,Takes your breath away.
18,00:00:47,00:00:48,Yeah. It can take more than that.
19,00:00:48,00:00:52,We used to call this place the Missile Base.
20,00:00:52,00:00:53,The Missile Base. Uh-huh.
21,00:00:53,00:00:55,Care to share why?
22,00:00:55,00:00:57,Why did I bring that up? Oh!
23,00:00:57,00:00:59,"All right, I'll tell you what."
24,00:00:59,00:01:01,I'll make it easy for you-- I'll go first.
25,00:01:01,00:01:05,"I met my wife freshman year in college, and she was my first and only love."
26,00:01:05,00:01:07,Aw.
27,00:01:07,00:01:08,Seriously?
28,00:01:08,00:01:10,You lost your virginity to your wife?
29,00:01:10,00:01:12,Yep. Yep.
30,00:01:12,00:01:14,Life is simple sometimes.
31,00:01:14,00:01:17,"You meet the right person, and you know it's forever."
32,00:01:17,00:01:19,"And that was a boring story, so it's your turn."
33,00:01:19,00:01:20,Tony Anthopoulos. I was 16.
34,00:01:20,00:01:22,"Too many beers, too little romance."
35,00:01:22,00:01:24,Seemed like a good idea at the time.
36,00:01:24,00:01:25,"Ah, that's better."
37,00:01:25,00:01:28,Swept away by the passion of the moment.
38,00:01:28,00:01:29,Something like that.
39,00:01:29,00:01:30,Tony was a bad boy.
40,00:01:30,00:01:32,First of many.
41,00:01:32,00:01:35,I liked being wanted... till that got old.
42,00:01:35,00:01:37,"Well, you're a very smart woman."
43,00:01:37,00:01:39,You probably just wanted to be appreciated for that too.
44,00:01:39,00:01:41,Yeah.
45,00:01:41,00:01:42,"Hey, David."
46,00:01:42,00:01:44,"Oh, hey."
47,00:01:44,00:01:46,"So, what are we looking at here?"
48,00:01:46,00:01:48,I'm not sure yet. Just got here myself.
49,00:01:48,00:01:50,WILLOWS: The tarp's pretty clean.
50,00:01:50,00:01:52,Doesn't look like it's been dragged or rolled.
51,00:01:52,00:01:55,Looks more like it was carried and placed here.
52,00:01:55,00:01:57,WILLOWS: We'll get it to Trace.
53,00:01:57,00:02:00,Concrete and caliche.
54,00:02:00,00:02:03,Not going to get any foot impressions.
55,00:02:15,00:02:17,Oh.
56,00:02:17,00:02:20,RUSSELL: There's like a dozen needles here.
57,00:02:20,00:02:22,But there's no blood.
58,00:02:23,00:02:25,(camera shutter clicks)
59,00:02:25,00:02:27,You got your shots?
60,00:02:27,00:02:28,Yeah.
61,00:02:30,00:02:33,There's some expertise demonstrated here.
62,00:02:33,00:02:37,Those needles are thrust through and through-- see that?
63,00:02:37,00:02:41,Yeah. Right under the cornified layers of the epidermis.
64,00:02:41,00:02:45,"Minimize the hemorrhaging, maximize the pain."
65,00:02:45,00:02:49,"RUSSELL: Well, this was not about killing her."
66,00:02:49,00:02:51,It was about watching her suffer.
67,00:03:29,00:03:31,(camera shutter clicking)
68,00:03:34,00:03:36,(door opening)
69,00:03:39,00:03:40,Morgan.
70,00:03:40,00:03:43,I heard Russell cleared you to come back.
71,00:03:43,00:03:44,If you need more time...
72,00:03:44,00:03:45,"Oh, I'm good."
73,00:03:45,00:03:49,I might put off that helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon for a while.
74,00:03:49,00:03:51,"Yeah, that'd probably be smart."
75,00:03:51,00:03:54,"Well, since you're here, I could use a hand."
76,00:03:54,00:03:56,"Yeah, no problem."
77,00:04:09,00:04:11,These are 20-gauge hypos.
78,00:04:11,00:04:14,The kind used in bone marrow transplants.
79,00:04:14,00:04:17,Killer had access to medical supplies.
80,00:04:17,00:04:21,Needles are inserted approximately three inches apart.
81,00:04:21,00:04:25,"Perpendicular, in a line, wrist to wrist."
82,00:04:25,00:04:27,You think the pattern is significant?
83,00:04:27,00:04:29,Seems ritualistic.
84,00:04:29,00:04:31,But it's definitely sadistic. Yeah.
85,00:04:32,00:04:34,Hold on.
86,00:04:35,00:04:37,This isn't a hypo.
87,00:04:39,00:04:41,(scoffs)
88,00:04:41,00:04:42,Shish kabob skewer.
89,00:04:44,00:04:47,It's a black residue.
90,00:04:48,00:04:50,Looks like candle wax.
91,00:04:52,00:04:54,The scarring-- it's all over her body.
92,00:04:54,00:04:57,Consistent with the needles and the skewer.
93,00:04:57,00:05:02,"You'd think after all these years, I wouldn't be surprised by what people are capable of."
94,00:05:04,00:05:06,(light scratching in distance)
95,00:05:12,00:05:13,Hodges? (gasps)
96,00:05:13,00:05:14,What are you doing?
97,00:05:14,00:05:15,Scusi.
98,00:05:15,00:05:18,Did Lorenzo interrupt Michelangelo when he was creating?
99,00:05:18,00:05:20,He didn't wrap bodies in his canvas.
100,00:05:20,00:05:23,And I thought you said you didn't find any trace on this.
101,00:05:23,00:05:24,Not trace.
102,00:05:24,00:05:26,Something better.
103,00:05:26,00:05:28,Art.
104,00:05:28,00:05:29,Are you familiar with a pentimento?
105,00:05:29,00:05:32,What do you think?
106,00:05:32,00:05:34,It's an alteration in a painting.
107,00:05:34,00:05:40,"When an artist makes a mistake or they want to change something, they simply whitewash over the error, and then begin again."
108,00:05:40,00:05:45,"I don't want to get too excited, but we may have a lost treasure here."
109,00:05:45,00:05:47,Maybe even a Rembrandt.
110,00:05:47,00:05:49,Really? Uh...
111,00:05:49,00:05:50,scusi.
112,00:05:50,00:05:53,Hmm? Oh.
113,00:05:53,00:05:55,Prego.
114,00:06:02,00:06:04,Mm.
115,00:06:04,00:06:05,I am getting excited.
116,00:06:05,00:06:06,See?
117,00:06:06,00:06:08,What I see is more layers.
118,00:06:08,00:06:10,"More paint, Leonardo."
119,00:06:10,00:06:14,Maybe what's under here will give us a clue to our killer.
120,00:06:14,00:06:15,So stop your scratching.
121,00:06:15,00:06:18,Canvas is mine now.
122,00:06:18,00:06:20,Huh. (speaks Italian)
123,00:06:20,00:06:23,"Hey, you better hope I don't find out what that means."
124,00:06:23,00:06:25,I ran our Jane Doe information through Missing Persons.
125,00:06:25,00:06:27,Nothing. Run it again.
126,00:06:27,00:06:29,I did. I know.
127,00:06:29,00:06:30,It doesn't make sense.
128,00:06:30,00:06:34,"The injuries, the evidence all suggest that she was abducted weeks ago."
129,00:06:34,00:06:37,Somebody should have missed her by now.
130,00:06:37,00:06:38,Doctor.
131,00:06:38,00:06:40,Hey. Hey.
132,00:06:50,00:06:52,"So, C.O.D.?"
133,00:06:52,00:06:54,Don't know yet.
134,00:06:54,00:06:56,I sent samples off to Toxicology.
135,00:06:56,00:06:58,We'll see what Henry has to say.
136,00:06:58,00:07:04,"As you both observed, the external scarring indicates a prolonged period of abuse."
137,00:07:04,00:07:08,"However, I did find something unusual about the injuries."
138,00:07:08,00:07:10,Scar tissue in the wound tracts.
139,00:07:10,00:07:15,It's as if the needles and the skewer were inserted in the same areas repeatedly.
140,00:07:15,00:07:16,You mean like body piercing?
141,00:07:16,00:07:23,"Similar. In piercing, a needle's inserted through the skin, penetrating the various layers of the epidermis."
142,00:07:23,00:07:28,"As scar tissue develops, a permanent hole is created."
143,00:07:28,00:07:31,"Difference in this case is, we're not talking about piercings."
144,00:07:31,00:07:33,"RUSSELL: No. No, we're not."
145,00:07:33,00:07:40,We're talking about 20-gauge needles and a barbecue skewer driven repeatedly into this girl's flesh.
146,00:07:40,00:07:42,That's what we're talking about.
147,00:07:46,00:07:48,What is this? Is this a knee implant?
148,00:07:48,00:07:49,"Hers, I assume."
149,00:07:49,00:07:52,She had unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
150,00:07:52,00:07:59,"Likely due to injury, given the attenuation of her collateral ligaments. RUSSELL: Whatever the case, we have a lot number, which will give us an orthopedic surgeon."
151,00:07:59,00:08:02,And a name for our...
152,00:08:02,00:08:04,our Jane Doe.
153,00:08:09,00:08:16,"WOMAN: Renny was born with an angular limb deformity in both rear legs, which means that her back legs were growing faster than her front legs."
154,00:08:16,00:08:25,"A horse foal my daughter Sylvia is nursing has the same condition, so, in order to help the bones grow, we performed a brief surgical procedure called a peristeal stripping. Now..."
155,00:08:25,00:08:27,Dr. Grier? Yes?
156,00:08:27,00:08:29,I'm Catherine Willows with the Crime Lab.
157,00:08:29,00:08:31,I need to speak with you.
158,00:08:31,00:08:32,I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of a seminar.
159,00:08:32,00:08:34,It's about your sister Rachel.
160,00:08:37,00:08:40,"So, when was the last time that you saw your sister?"
161,00:08:40,00:08:42,I haven't seen Rachel in years.
162,00:08:42,00:08:43,She called me a few months ago.
163,00:08:43,00:08:46,"Um, she had some medical bills, needed money."
164,00:08:46,00:08:49,Fort Lauderdale. She had knee surgery.
165,00:08:49,00:08:52,I just wired her the money.
166,00:08:52,00:08:54,I stopped asking questions a long time ago.
167,00:08:54,00:08:55,What do you mean?
168,00:08:55,00:08:58,My little sister was a wild child.
169,00:08:58,00:09:01,She ran away after high school.
170,00:09:01,00:09:04,She broke my mother's heart.
171,00:09:04,00:09:07,(voice breaking): Rachel couldn't even be bothered to come to her funeral.
172,00:09:09,00:09:11,You say that she met with violence.
173,00:09:11,00:09:13,What does that mean? What happened?
174,00:09:13,00:09:15,I'm sorry; I can't discuss the specifics.
175,00:09:15,00:09:23,"What I can tell you is that we found her here in Vegas, and we suspect that she was taken against her will, probably several weeks ago."
176,00:09:23,00:09:26,That's impossible.
177,00:09:26,00:09:29,"I had lunch with Aunt Rachel on Monday, and she was totally fine."
178,00:09:29,00:09:30,You had lunch with Rachel?
179,00:09:30,00:09:32,I didn't even know she was in town...
180,00:09:32,00:09:35,"WILLOWS: Excuse me, Sylvia, you saw your aunt three days ago?"
181,00:09:35,00:09:40,"Yeah. I mean, she called, and she said that she was in town and needed to talk."
182,00:09:40,00:09:42,Made me promise not to say anything.
183,00:09:42,00:09:44,Why?
184,00:09:44,00:09:48,My mom and Aunt Rachel don't really talk.
185,00:09:48,00:09:52,But Aunt Rachel wanted things to change; she wanted to fix things.
186,00:09:52,00:09:54,She wanted to come home.
187,00:09:54,00:09:57,Where did you and your Aunt Rachel have lunch?
188,00:09:57,00:09:59,The Tangiers.
189,00:09:59,00:10:01,I don't know. Maybe she was staying there.
190,00:10:03,00:10:05,"SANDERS: Hey, Catherine."
191,00:10:05,00:10:09,"Tangiers was a bust-- Rachel Grier was never registered, and no one I.D.'d her photo."
192,00:10:09,00:10:11,"Yeah, I'm on it."
193,00:10:11,00:10:12,"Hey, Henry, got my tox report?"
194,00:10:12,00:10:14,"Yeah, right here."
195,00:10:14,00:10:15,Great.
196,00:10:15,00:10:16,"Mm, not so great."
197,00:10:16,00:10:18,What's the problem?
198,00:10:18,00:10:22,"You'll find the findings are both inconclusive and, well, confusing."
199,00:10:22,00:10:24,She had lidocaine in her system?
200,00:10:24,00:10:25,But it didn't kill her.
201,00:10:25,00:10:32,"""Injected at therapeutic levels directly into the tissue surrounding the hypodermic needles."" And the skewer."
202,00:10:32,00:10:36,What kind of sadist uses an anesthetic before torturing their victims?
203,00:11:14,00:11:17,"STOKES: I dug out these images, using optical microscopy."
204,00:11:17,00:11:19,So what are we feeling about this?
205,00:11:19,00:11:25,"Depressed. Yeah, I mean, it's no Rembrandt. RUSSELL: You know, maybe it's a Rachel Grier."
206,00:11:25,00:11:27,"I mean, look at that."
207,00:11:27,00:11:29,That's gotta be more than a coincidence.
208,00:11:31,00:11:34,"WILLOWS: Yeah, there's a similar pattern to the needles in her arms."
209,00:11:34,00:11:37,BRODY: And the flames-- we did find candle wax residue.
210,00:11:37,00:11:42,"HODGES: Now, is it me or does she look like a human candelabra?"
211,00:11:42,00:11:44,"RUSSELL: All right, let's think about this."
212,00:11:44,00:11:47,Maybe our victim was posed to look like this painting.
213,00:11:47,00:11:53,So you're saying you think that our killer was inspired by this image? Maybe.
214,00:11:53,00:11:56,Or maybe the killer got artistic as he was torturing her.
215,00:11:56,00:12:03,"Poses her, paints her, doesn't like his work, so he whitewashes over it, and then just wraps her up in his failure."
216,00:12:03,00:12:10,"Question is, which came first-- Rachel Grier or Rachel Grier?"
217,00:12:10,00:12:12,"BRODY: Hey, guys."
218,00:12:12,00:12:16,"I just did an image search for ""human candelabra."" Check it out."
219,00:12:16,00:12:20,Major Willie's Rambling Carnival and Curious Extravaganza.
220,00:12:20,00:12:21,HODGES: Which century you get this out of?
221,00:12:21,00:12:23,(Brody chuckles)
222,00:12:23,00:12:27,"This one, as in tonight, two shows, 7:00 and 10:00."
223,00:12:27,00:12:30,WILLOWS: Featuring the Human Candelabra.
224,00:12:30,00:12:38,"RUSSELL: ""The Magnificent Femmistopheles, Empress of Pain."" STOKES: Looks like it's time for a road trip."
225,00:12:38,00:12:40,(man speaking indistinctly over P.A.)
226,00:12:43,00:12:46,BARKER: You wish to try? Only ten bucks to try.
227,00:13:06,00:13:08,(groans quietly)
228,00:13:10,00:13:12,That's the oldest trick in the book.
229,00:13:12,00:13:14,About all they're good for nowadays.
230,00:13:20,00:13:22,BARKER: Come up and get your darts.
231,00:13:22,00:13:25,You buy the darts for ten of your Yankee dollars.
232,00:13:25,00:13:29,"Now, who will be next?"
233,00:13:29,00:13:32,"Pop the cherry, win a prize."
234,00:13:32,00:13:34,"Come on, you have to do better than that."
235,00:13:34,00:13:36,"Pop the cherry, win a prize."
236,00:13:36,00:13:37,This is entertainment?
237,00:13:37,00:13:38,(groans)
238,00:13:38,00:13:40,Hard to tell who's more entertained.
239,00:13:42,00:13:43,"(man groans, spectators applaud)"
240,00:13:43,00:13:46,"Well done, mate."
241,00:13:46,00:13:48,"Sorry, kitty's not a virgin."
242,00:13:50,00:13:52,Zodiac will be back in 15 minutes.
243,00:13:53,00:13:55,Be seeing you.
244,00:14:00,00:14:02,Oh... my... God.
245,00:14:05,00:14:08,"Oh, it looks like Femmistopheles is a no-show."
246,00:14:08,00:14:10,RUSSELL: I want to look inside.
247,00:14:11,00:14:12,Can I help you?
248,00:14:12,00:14:15,We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
249,00:14:15,00:14:18,"Sorry, no comping the constables here, I'm afraid."
250,00:14:18,00:14:21,So who's in charge of this freak show?
251,00:14:21,00:14:24,"Me-- you've seen the game, you know the name."
252,00:14:24,00:14:25,Major Willie at your service.
253,00:14:25,00:14:27,Good to know.
254,00:14:27,00:14:28,WILLOWS: Have you seen this woman?
255,00:14:28,00:14:30,Seen her?
256,00:14:30,00:14:32,I've seen all of her.
257,00:14:32,00:14:34,"Femmistopheles, Empress of Pain."
258,00:14:35,00:14:37,"So, what'd she do this time?"
259,00:14:37,00:14:38,She's dead.
260,00:14:38,00:14:42,That's... unfortunate.
261,00:14:42,00:14:44,You don't seem too broken up.
262,00:14:44,00:14:46,Or surprised.
263,00:14:46,00:14:48,WILLOWS: Maybe we know why.
264,00:14:55,00:14:58,WILLIE: Am I surprised Rachel's dead?
265,00:14:58,00:14:59,No. RUSSELL: And why is that?
266,00:14:59,00:15:01,"Well, take a look around you."
267,00:15:01,00:15:04,You've heard what your friend said-- we're freaks.
268,00:15:04,00:15:12,"You try cranking up this whoopee machine two shows a night, on the road 351 days a year, ending up in places you wouldn't want to be seen dead in."
269,00:15:13,00:15:16,"Sorry, poor choice."
270,00:15:16,00:15:20,"So what was it-- O.D., old ex?"
271,00:15:20,00:15:23,Rachel always did have the most appalling taste in men.
272,00:15:23,00:15:25,Does that include you?
273,00:15:25,00:15:28,I was the best thing that ever happened to her.
274,00:15:28,00:15:31,I saw qualities in Rachel she couldn't see in herself.
275,00:15:31,00:15:33,Lucky girl.
276,00:15:33,00:15:38,"Willie, we need to check out that tent, so you gonna step aside or do we need to go get a warrant?"
277,00:15:38,00:15:40,Boss.
278,00:15:40,00:15:42,Joey needs his intro.
279,00:15:42,00:15:45,"Zodiac, aidez les gendarmes."
280,00:15:46,00:15:47,It's all good.
281,00:15:47,00:15:49,I'm gonna keep my eye on Willie.
282,00:15:49,00:15:51,"Yeah, D.B., I'm gonna grab some equipment."
283,00:15:51,00:15:53,I'll be right back.
284,00:16:00,00:16:08,Life is full of terrible surprises and miserable fates.
285,00:16:08,00:16:27,"Consider that of a young woman, heavy with child, mauled by a ferocious pachyderm-- her son born hideously deformed, yet able to sow the seeds of future generations, all cursed to the same twisted destiny."
286,00:16:27,00:16:35,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the last heir of the House of Merrick-- Joseph the Elephant Man!"
287,00:16:35,00:16:37,"MAN: Aw, come on."
288,00:16:37,00:16:39,ANNOUNCER: Surprised?
289,00:16:39,00:16:42,Disgusted?
290,00:16:42,00:16:45,Not what you paid to see?
291,00:16:45,00:16:53,I want to draw your attention to the condition of this poor specimen.
292,00:16:53,00:17:00,"Note the aquiline jaw, the sharp, muscular definition."
293,00:17:00,00:17:04,This animal... is not one of us.
294,00:17:04,00:17:09,"He is not a freak, a freak like me."
295,00:17:09,00:17:11,(gasping and murmuring)
296,00:17:22,00:17:24,Watch as she continues to wrap these chains around me...
297,00:17:42,00:17:44,I got hypos and skewers.
298,00:17:44,00:17:46,I got blood.
299,00:17:50,00:17:55,"If she was tortured in this chair, the blood pattern's off."
300,00:17:55,00:17:56,There's no void.
301,00:18:02,00:18:04,Hey-- see these streaks?
302,00:18:04,00:18:06,This contraption could be our blood source.
303,00:18:06,00:18:08,"Where is, uh...?"
304,00:18:08,00:18:09,"Oh, yeah."
305,00:18:09,00:18:11,"What, what do I call you again?"
306,00:18:11,00:18:15,Zodiac. Can you tell us a little bit more about Femmistopheles' act?
307,00:18:15,00:18:17,Wasn't an act.
308,00:18:17,00:18:19,It was unlike anything you ever seen.
309,00:18:25,00:18:28,(gasps)
310,00:18:28,00:18:30,(screams)
311,00:18:34,00:18:36,"(crowd applauds, whoops)"
312,00:18:39,00:18:41,"(whistling, applause)"
313,00:18:41,00:18:44,ZODIAC: She didn't just give a performance.
314,00:18:44,00:18:46,She gave her own blood.
315,00:18:46,00:18:48,She rocked the house.
316,00:18:48,00:18:51,"And people-- what, they'd pay extra to see this?"
317,00:18:51,00:18:55,What's the point in torturing yourself if we ain't all going to have some fun?
318,00:18:55,00:18:58,"Okay, and what's back there?"
319,00:18:58,00:18:59,Femmie's dressing room.
320,00:18:59,00:19:01,She lived in it.
321,00:19:40,00:19:42,(clears throat)
322,00:19:42,00:19:43,Ah...
323,00:19:43,00:19:45,Empress of pain and pleasure.
324,00:19:48,00:19:50,You mind?
325,00:19:51,00:19:53,Thought you were a coffee snob.
326,00:19:53,00:19:55,Machine in my office is broken.
327,00:19:55,00:19:57,I'm waiting for parts.
328,00:19:59,00:20:02,(sniffs) Mm.
329,00:20:02,00:20:04,"A little light reading, I see."
330,00:20:04,00:20:07,Satisfying my curiosity.
331,00:20:07,00:20:14,"So Nick and I found a whole pharmacy in Rachel Grier's tent, including lidocaine."
332,00:20:14,00:20:15,Henry is sourcing the stuff for me.
333,00:20:15,00:20:18,Also running an expanded tox panel.
334,00:20:18,00:20:20,Maybe one of the other drugs killed her.
335,00:20:20,00:20:23,"Here, we thought some sick bastard tortured the girl."
336,00:20:23,00:20:24,Maybe she OD'd.
337,00:20:24,00:20:26,"Nah, you know, I don't think so, actually."
338,00:20:26,00:20:31,"I mean, she certainly wouldn't have wrapped up her own body and dumped it. No."
339,00:20:31,00:20:33,"You know, there's something about this Major Willie."
340,00:20:33,00:20:36,He reminds me of...
341,00:20:36,00:20:39,"I told you about my parents being singers, right?"
342,00:20:39,00:20:41,"Yeah. Performers, really."
343,00:20:41,00:20:45,"When I was a kid, they were part of this traveling show."
344,00:20:45,00:20:48,We went around the country in our van.
345,00:20:48,00:20:54,"Anyway, the leader of this group was a, a guy who called himself Durga Joe."
346,00:20:54,00:20:59,"He was a real charismatic, kind of like this Willie guy."
347,00:20:59,00:21:01,He could make people...
348,00:21:01,00:21:05,he could make people do pretty much anything he wanted.
349,00:21:05,00:21:13,"That was the problem, at least for my parents, so, one day they decided they wanted to leave and Durga Joe did not like that at all."
350,00:21:13,00:21:14,What happened?
351,00:21:14,00:21:18,"In the middle of the night, we got in our van and we just took off."
352,00:21:18,00:21:20,And never really... looked back.
353,00:21:20,00:21:26,"Anyway... the point is that this Rachel Grier, she wanted to leave, too, you know?"
354,00:21:26,00:21:28,She wanted to go home.
355,00:21:28,00:21:30,Maybe this is about control.
356,00:21:30,00:21:34,"Major Willie's Rambling Carnival-- one big, happy family."
357,00:21:34,00:21:36,Until somebody wants to leave.
358,00:21:36,00:21:38,Got your new and improved tox panel.
359,00:21:38,00:21:42,I know what killed Rachel Grier and maybe who.
360,00:21:44,00:21:48,"STOKES: Major Willie-- aka Steven Watt of Tampa, Florida."
361,00:21:48,00:21:53,"You know, without the Willy Wonka get-up, you could pass for just another freak."
362,00:21:53,00:22:00,"The word is ""geek,"" as in someone who can perform freakish acts without actually themselves being a freak of nature."
363,00:22:00,00:22:01,I'll take your word for it.
364,00:22:01,00:22:03,And I will take that.
365,00:22:03,00:22:05,"Oh, look."
366,00:22:05,00:22:07,What's he going to do?
367,00:22:15,00:22:17,"Yeah, and if you think that's freaky..."
368,00:22:26,00:22:31,"(splutters) Don't worry, I'll regurgitate it later."
369,00:22:31,00:22:34,Wow. We gotta learn how to do that.
370,00:22:35,00:22:37,"So, uh..."
371,00:22:37,00:22:40,we know what killed Rachel-- propofol.
372,00:22:40,00:22:48,"Which is used in anesthesia, but in high enough doses and without a ventilator, it paralyzes the diaphragm."
373,00:22:48,00:22:50,So basically...
374,00:22:50,00:22:53,Rachel... suffocated to death.
375,00:22:53,00:22:57,STOKES: You're licensed in Florida and New York to practice body piercings and modifications.
376,00:22:57,00:23:02,That's how you were able to obtain the pharmaceuticals we found in Rachel's tent.
377,00:23:02,00:23:04,You people just don't get it.
378,00:23:04,00:23:06,We don't get what?
379,00:23:06,00:23:08,Freaks versus geeks.
380,00:23:08,00:23:12,"A guy like Zodiac, he has congenital analgesia."
381,00:23:12,00:23:15,He was born not feeling pain-- a freak.
382,00:23:15,00:23:18,"Rachel and me, we need..."
383,00:23:18,00:23:20,needed help.
384,00:23:20,00:23:22,A little pharmacology.
385,00:23:22,00:23:27,"Stuff like lidocaine, to take the edge off the pain, to enhance performance."
386,00:23:32,00:23:36,"No drugs, no show, no dough."
387,00:23:36,00:23:41,I won't lie-- maybe at the end of the evening we all like to indulge in a little...
388,00:23:41,00:23:43,something something...
389,00:23:43,00:23:46,to ease an old carney's burden.
390,00:23:46,00:23:48,But straight up...
391,00:23:48,00:23:52,"I am a businessman; I look after my people, I take care of them."
392,00:23:52,00:23:55,"And Rachel, she was an earner."
393,00:23:55,00:23:59,"Who wanted to stop earning, I believe."
394,00:23:59,00:24:01,She would never have left me.
395,00:24:06,00:24:10,"You didn't find any propofol in Rachel's tent, did you?"
396,00:24:10,00:24:11,No.
397,00:24:11,00:24:13,Am I under arrest?
398,00:24:13,00:24:15,"Not yet, no."
399,00:24:15,00:24:18,"But this, uh, this is just our opening act."
400,00:24:18,00:24:20,Here. One for the road.
401,00:24:22,00:24:28,BRODY: Got the DNA results from Rachel Grier's tent-- the blood Russell found in the fridge is a match to Rachel.
402,00:24:28,00:24:30,"Also the torture chair. Well, it makes sense."
403,00:24:30,00:24:32,Rachel was storing her blood to use in her act.
404,00:24:32,00:24:37,"Yeah, well, the blood also tells us another story-- hormone levels suggest that Rachel was pregnant."
405,00:24:37,00:24:42,Labels on the pack say as recently as two weeks ago.
406,00:24:42,00:24:44,There was no evidence in autopsy.
407,00:24:44,00:24:46,Not just that.
408,00:24:46,00:24:51,Nick found traces of blood and semen in Rachel's bed.
409,00:24:51,00:24:53,Single donor.
410,00:24:53,00:24:54,No hits in CODIS.
411,00:24:54,00:25:05,"""Profile is a male Caucasian suffering from neurofibromatosis type-1 and Proteus Syndrome."" Rachel was sleeping with the Elephant Man?"
412,00:25:22,00:25:25,"So, last heir to the House of Merrick."
413,00:25:25,00:25:26,That's a good story.
414,00:25:26,00:25:29,"I saw the movie, too-- it was... I liked it."
415,00:25:29,00:25:33,"But truth is, there is... no house, right?"
416,00:25:33,00:25:36,Because the Elephant Man didn't have any children.
417,00:25:36,00:25:40,"So your name's not really Merrick, is it?"
418,00:25:40,00:25:42,No. My name is Joshua Helm.
419,00:25:42,00:25:45,"And, Joshua, you don't have any children, either, do you?"
420,00:25:45,00:25:48,No. Rachel Grier made sure of that.
421,00:25:48,00:25:50,She got rid of the baby.
422,00:25:50,00:25:53,Just like she wanted to get rid of you.
423,00:25:53,00:25:55,You don't know what you're saying.
424,00:25:55,00:25:57,Rachel and I were in love.
425,00:25:57,00:26:01,Is that why she was making plans to leave the show? Yes.
426,00:26:01,00:26:06,"I told her she was crazy, that we couldn't have a normal life on the outside."
427,00:26:06,00:26:10,Wait-wait-wait a minute. So you're saying that the two of you were planning on going away together?
428,00:26:10,00:26:12,That's what she wanted.
429,00:26:12,00:26:15,"You could survive on the outside, but I can't."
430,00:26:15,00:26:17,You can with me.
431,00:26:17,00:26:20,"I love you, Joshua-- that's all that matters."
432,00:26:20,00:26:24,"Rachel had lost the child, and she wanted to try again."
433,00:26:24,00:26:26,I said no.
434,00:26:26,00:26:30,"I told her she could leave if she wanted to, but that I wasn't going with her."
435,00:26:30,00:26:34,"Rachel was always naive, living in a fantasy land."
436,00:26:34,00:26:37,You do tell a good story.
437,00:26:44,00:26:47,Is that what you think this is?
438,00:26:47,00:26:51,"I've already seen the show, and I'm familiar with the story."
439,00:26:51,00:27:01,"Girl hates her life, is searching for something, thinks she finds it in a man, a man who needs her, and then..."
440,00:27:01,00:27:03,it all goes wrong.
441,00:27:03,00:27:07,You killed her because she wanted her life back.
442,00:27:07,00:27:14,"Look... I don't know what happened to Rachel, and if you're trying to provoke me, it's not working."
443,00:27:15,00:27:24,"You can't imagine how the love that we had for each other existed, because you've never known it."
444,00:27:24,00:27:26,And you never will.
445,00:27:29,00:27:33,"SANDERS: So, we turned Major Willie's Carnival upside down, didn't find any propofol."
446,00:27:33,00:27:35,We have any record of him buying the stuff?
447,00:27:35,00:27:41,"No, we have nothing to tie him to the drugs that killed Rachel, (phone rings) and Brass just cut him loose."
448,00:27:41,00:27:42,Stokes.
449,00:27:42,00:27:44,Yeah.
450,00:27:44,00:27:46,You kidding me?
451,00:27:46,00:27:49,"Greg'll be interested to hear that. Thanks, Jimbo."
452,00:27:49,00:27:53,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to cut Major Willie loose again."
453,00:28:00,00:28:01,Well...
454,00:28:01,00:28:03,rigor hasn't set in.
455,00:28:03,00:28:06,T.O.D.'s less than two hours ago.
456,00:28:06,00:28:08,STOKES: No vital response.
457,00:28:08,00:28:10,He was dead before he was hanged.
458,00:28:10,00:28:12,Staged.
459,00:28:12,00:28:13,"Yeah, poorly."
460,00:28:13,00:28:16,"Okay, cut him down, get him to Autopsy."
461,00:28:16,00:28:17,Let's find out what really killed him.
462,00:28:17,00:28:19,CSI Stokes?
463,00:28:19,00:28:22,Yeah. We've got a suspect in custody.
464,00:28:25,00:28:27,"OFFICER: You need to stay back, okay?"
465,00:28:27,00:28:29,Which one of the freaks is it?
466,00:28:29,00:28:31,There.
467,00:28:33,00:28:35,Suspect's name is Sylvia Grier.
468,00:28:35,00:28:38,STOKES: Rachel Grier's niece?
469,00:28:42,00:28:44,(blipping)
470,00:29:03,00:29:05,WOMAN: This is insane.
471,00:29:05,00:29:10,"Dr. Grier, your daughter was detained while fleeing the scene of an apparent homicide."
472,00:29:10,00:29:17,"I... I don't know what Sylvia was doing at that freak show, but... but I do know that she would never hurt anyone."
473,00:29:17,00:29:20,"Well, then neither you nor Sylvia has anything to be afraid of."
474,00:29:22,00:29:24,"What were you doing there, Sylvia?"
475,00:29:24,00:29:28,I went there because I needed to see for myself.
476,00:29:28,00:29:30,See what?
477,00:29:30,00:29:33,S--see who my aunt really was.
478,00:29:33,00:29:40,"I found the story online, ""Sideshow Performer Murdered,"" and it was Aunt Rachel."
479,00:29:40,00:29:45,"To my mom, Aunt Rachel was a ghost, but..."
480,00:29:45,00:29:48,"to me, she was like this..."
481,00:29:48,00:29:50,force of nature.
482,00:29:50,00:29:57,"You know? She did what she wanted to do and lived how she wanted to live, and I just felt this..."
483,00:29:57,00:29:59,connection.
484,00:30:01,00:30:04,"I mean, is that weird?"
485,00:30:04,00:30:08,"Look, I didn't kill that man."
486,00:30:08,00:30:10,Why don't you tell me what happened?
487,00:30:10,00:30:15,"I went looking for where Aunt Rachel had been living, and I got lost."
488,00:30:15,00:30:18,"And I wandered into that tent, and that's when I saw him."
489,00:30:21,00:30:24,I was so scared.
490,00:30:24,00:30:27,"And then, they were all staring at me."
491,00:30:27,00:30:30,"I mean, they thought I did it."
492,00:30:30,00:30:32,So I ran.
493,00:30:32,00:30:34,"And I hid, but the officers found me."
494,00:30:36,00:30:38,I didn't do anything.
495,00:30:40,00:30:42,RUSSELL: Do you believe her?
496,00:30:42,00:30:44,Sylvia? Yes.
497,00:30:44,00:30:46,"Well, I don't know what to believe anymore."
498,00:30:46,00:30:49,I think I made a mistake about Major Willie.
499,00:30:49,00:30:52,I think I let my past cloud my thinking.
500,00:30:52,00:30:53,"Well, we're all guilty of that."
501,00:30:53,00:30:55,"Whoa, what do you mean?"
502,00:30:55,00:30:58,"You're not having doubts about our Elephant Man, are you?"
503,00:30:58,00:31:00,No. No.
504,00:31:00,00:31:07,"I mean, I don't like being called out (laughs): about my lack of romance, but it's no argument for innocence."
505,00:31:07,00:31:11,You still think Elephant Man had motive to kill Rachel?
506,00:31:11,00:31:20,"Yes. Yes, and I think Sylvia was sincere about feeling a connection towards her aunt, which says to me that she wouldn't do her any harm."
507,00:31:20,00:31:26,Okay. But that doesn't mean that she wouldn't go after the man who she believed did.
508,00:31:26,00:31:27,Major Willie?
509,00:31:27,00:31:29,But why would she suspect that he killed Rachel?
510,00:31:29,00:31:32,We're not even convinced ourselves.
511,00:31:32,00:31:34,Maybe somebody whispered Willie's name in her ear.
512,00:31:34,00:31:36,Maybe our real killer.
513,00:31:42,00:31:44,Okay.
514,00:31:44,00:31:46,"What have we got here, boys?"
515,00:31:46,00:31:48,"Well, your carnival barker's C.O.D."
516,00:31:48,00:31:56,"was massive internal hemorrhaging due to an inch-and-a-half laceration and perforation of the stomach wall, severing the left gastro-omental artery."
517,00:31:56,00:31:58,Check it out.
518,00:31:58,00:32:01,Stomach wall's punctured from the inside out.
519,00:32:01,00:32:05,That's bigger than a paper clip.
520,00:32:05,00:32:08,I found no injuries to the pharynx or esophagus.
521,00:32:08,00:32:12,"So, it's not like somebody shoved something down his throat."
522,00:32:12,00:32:13,"No, no."
523,00:32:13,00:32:15,Guy swallowed a sword.
524,00:32:15,00:32:16,Check that out.
525,00:32:16,00:32:18,"SANDERS: Well, that would do it."
526,00:32:18,00:32:21,"Actually, our friend here swallowed lots of things."
527,00:32:21,00:32:23,"Bon appétit, gentlemen."
528,00:32:51,00:32:54,"Good thing for us, Major Willie bit off more than he could chew."
529,00:32:55,00:32:57,Gemini.
530,00:32:57,00:33:00,Sign of the Zodiac.
531,00:33:00,00:33:02,Take your shirt off.
532,00:33:02,00:33:06,"You want to play, you got to pay."
533,00:33:06,00:33:08,"Oh, I got my ticket right here, Muscles."
534,00:33:08,00:33:10,It's called a search warrant.
535,00:33:10,00:33:12,"Now, take it off."
536,00:33:25,00:33:28,"If you want a picture with me, your friend right there I'm sure will take it."
537,00:33:28,00:33:30,"No, that's all right. I'll pass."
538,00:33:30,00:33:32,We're done here.
539,00:33:32,00:33:35,Check him for warrants while you're at it.
540,00:33:38,00:33:40,"Catherine, it's Nick."
541,00:33:40,00:33:42,No go on Zodiac.
542,00:33:42,00:33:44,We're gonna need a pile of warrants.
543,00:33:44,00:33:46,We're gonna need to bring the whole freak show down here.
544,00:34:10,00:34:12,"I need to see your chest, too."
545,00:34:14,00:34:16,You want some help?
546,00:34:24,00:34:26,Remove the bandage.
547,00:34:26,00:34:28,(groans)
548,00:34:30,00:34:32,Dog bite.
549,00:34:32,00:34:35,I hope you had all your shots.
550,00:34:35,00:34:38,Sergio the Strong.
551,00:34:38,00:34:40,Where do you people come up with the stage names?
552,00:34:40,00:34:42,"I mean, I get it, I do."
553,00:34:42,00:34:46,"Because ""Seth the Strong"" doesn't look good on a poster."
554,00:34:46,00:34:50,"But ""Seth Soon-To-Be-Convicted""-- that has a ring to it."
555,00:34:50,00:34:53,We got back the DNA profile on your ounce of flesh.
556,00:34:53,00:34:57,Looks like you and the Elephant Man were fraternal twins.
557,00:34:57,00:35:00,"I got to admit, I didn't see that coming."
558,00:35:00,00:35:03,"And let me guess, mom always liked you best."
559,00:35:03,00:35:06,We know Rachel broke your brother's heart.
560,00:35:06,00:35:08,You made her pay for that.
561,00:35:08,00:35:11,"And then when Willie found out what you did, you shut him up, too. Is that about right?"
562,00:35:13,00:35:17,Our mom died during childbirth.
563,00:35:17,00:35:19,Dad dumped us before we could walk.
564,00:35:19,00:35:26,"And when Joshua started to... change, the relatives we were staying with got freaked out."
565,00:35:26,00:35:29,Said that Joshua and me were born of the devil.
566,00:35:29,00:35:32,"For my brother, there was only one path to salvation."
567,00:35:32,00:35:37,Major Willie's Rambling Carnival and Curious Extravaganza.
568,00:35:37,00:35:41,"Willie was no saint, but he was better than most."
569,00:35:41,00:35:44,He didn't treat my brother like a monster.
570,00:35:44,00:35:46,He was... he was good to him.
571,00:35:48,00:35:50,Until...
572,00:35:50,00:35:51,Until what?
573,00:35:55,00:35:57,What the hell happened?
574,00:35:57,00:35:59,I don't know.
575,00:35:59,00:36:01,I just found her like this.
576,00:36:01,00:36:03,Maybe she OD'd or something.
577,00:36:03,00:36:04,You call the cops?
578,00:36:04,00:36:06,You crazy?
579,00:36:06,00:36:07,They'll close us down.
580,00:36:07,00:36:08,"You got to help me, Seth."
581,00:36:08,00:36:10,We need to make this go away.
582,00:36:10,00:36:13,Think about your brother.
583,00:36:13,00:36:14,No show.
584,00:36:14,00:36:16,Where does that leave him?
585,00:36:19,00:36:21,SERGIO: So I did what he asked me.
586,00:36:33,00:36:35,I made it all go away.
587,00:36:35,00:36:37,But it didn't go away.
588,00:36:37,00:36:40,And we all know that Rachel didn't just OD.
589,00:36:40,00:36:44,You people found out what was going on between Joshua and Rachel.
590,00:36:44,00:36:47,"You hauled him in here, you questioned him."
591,00:36:47,00:36:48,But he didn't do it.
592,00:36:48,00:36:50,How do you know that?
593,00:36:50,00:36:51,'Cause I know who did.
594,00:36:51,00:36:53,Cops picked up Joshua.
595,00:36:53,00:36:55,Don't sweat it.
596,00:36:55,00:36:56,That's just what they do.
597,00:36:56,00:36:58,Josh will be fine.
598,00:36:58,00:37:01,Best thing you can do is to keep your mouth shut.
599,00:37:01,00:37:03,Trust me.
600,00:37:07,00:37:09,Not this time.
601,00:37:15,00:37:19,(grunting)
602,00:37:24,00:37:26,(both grunting)
603,00:37:29,00:37:31,(screams)
604,00:37:33,00:37:36,I didn't mean to kill him.
605,00:37:36,00:37:42,"I thought that if I made it look like he killed himself, that it all would really go away."
606,00:37:43,00:37:46,"You don't believe me, do you?"
607,00:37:46,00:37:49,We believe the evidence.
608,00:37:50,00:37:53,(grunting forcefully)
609,00:38:02,00:38:05,There's your evidence.
610,00:38:05,00:38:07,Willie killed Rachel.
611,00:38:18,00:38:21,Heard the suspect coughed up the smoking gun.
612,00:38:21,00:38:24,Yeah.
613,00:38:24,00:38:26,"What, did Nick leave you to do the dirty work?"
614,00:38:26,00:38:28,"No. Actually, I wanted to run this myself."
615,00:38:28,00:38:32,"So, Sergio found the propofol when he was cleaning up Rachel's tent?"
616,00:38:32,00:38:36,"Yeah, he had doubts about Willie, so he decided to hang on to this."
617,00:38:36,00:38:38,In his stomach?
618,00:38:38,00:38:40,"Better than a safety deposit box, I guess."
619,00:38:40,00:38:42,Little messier.
620,00:38:42,00:38:44,So the propofol belonged to Willie?
621,00:38:44,00:38:46,That's what Sergio thinks.
622,00:38:46,00:38:47,I'm not so sure.
623,00:38:47,00:38:49,Why not?
624,00:38:49,00:38:51,Willie was the resident Dr. Feel Good.
625,00:38:51,00:38:56,"Well, if we're to believe Sergio's story, Willie talked him into dumping a body for him."
626,00:38:56,00:38:58,"I mean, come on."
627,00:38:58,00:39:00,Guys like Willie are the consummate con artists.
628,00:39:00,00:39:02,"They're, like, the best salesmen in the world."
629,00:39:02,00:39:07,"So my question is: if he was worried about losing Rachel, why wouldn't he just talk her out of it?"
630,00:39:07,00:39:11,"If he could talk her out of it, there'd be no reason to kill her."
631,00:39:11,00:39:12,Right.
632,00:39:12,00:39:14,So back to the Elephant Man?
633,00:39:14,00:39:17,(computer beeping)
634,00:39:17,00:39:20,Nope.
635,00:39:20,00:39:25,WILLOWS: We traced the drug that killed your sister Rachel to the Clark County Zoo.
636,00:39:25,00:39:27,To you.
637,00:39:28,00:39:30,Why?
638,00:39:31,00:39:36,My daughter always worshipped Rachel.
639,00:39:36,00:39:40,Even though she was barely a part of our lives.
640,00:39:40,00:39:54,"To Sylvia, Rachel was this adventurer, this nonconformist, a free spirit-- everything I wasn't, everything I wasn't allowing Sylvia to be."
641,00:39:56,00:39:58,Rachel was just a fantasy.
642,00:40:00,00:40:02,Until she wasn't.
643,00:40:02,00:40:05,She wanted to come back into our lives.
644,00:40:05,00:40:12,To insert her twisted self into our home.
645,00:40:12,00:40:17,Sh--she was having sex with that... that thing.
646,00:40:17,00:40:21,What kind of a sick person would do that?
647,00:40:21,00:40:23,She was your sister.
648,00:40:23,00:40:27,No... she wasn't.
649,00:40:27,00:40:31,She was... she was a freak.
650,00:40:31,00:40:37,I told her there was no place in our home for her.
651,00:40:37,00:40:39,But she wouldn't listen.
652,00:40:39,00:40:42,She tried to go through Sylvia to get to me.
653,00:40:42,00:40:45,She used her.
654,00:40:45,00:40:47,My own daughter.
655,00:40:47,00:40:51,Who always loved my sister more than she loved me.
656,00:40:51,00:40:53,My sister left me no choice.
657,00:40:53,00:40:56,And you left her to suffocate.
658,00:40:56,00:40:59,I did what I had to do.
659,00:41:00,00:41:03,I protected my daughter.
660,00:41:07,00:41:09,You don't understand.
661,00:41:09,00:41:11,She's the only family I have.
662,00:41:14,00:41:18,I would've done anything... anything to protect her.
663,00:41:22,00:41:25,Sylvia's safe now.
664,00:41:25,00:41:29,She's safe from the monsters in this world.
665,00:41:29,00:41:33,"Yes, she is."
