0,00:00:26,00:00:28,Is that the expanded tox report?
1,00:00:28,00:00:30,"Yes, it is."
2,00:00:31,00:00:35,Searched 600 metabolites and nothing unusual.
3,00:00:35,00:00:38,Makes Mr. Kelly our third undetermined in three weeks.
4,00:00:38,00:00:40,ROBBINS: Chief coroner's gonna be on my butt.
5,00:00:40,00:00:43,"Conduct a review, cut the budget."
6,00:00:43,00:00:44,I was at the scene.
7,00:00:44,00:00:49,"Pretty standard: mother came home, found him convulsing, tried CPR."
8,00:00:49,00:00:54,"ROBBINS: No prior history of seizures, only trace amounts of meth in his system, not enough to kill him."
9,00:00:54,00:00:57,Put him in the meat locker next to the other two.
10,00:00:57,00:00:59,I'm gonna figure this out.
11,00:01:06,00:01:08,"I'm doing you a solid here, Doc."
12,00:01:08,00:01:14,"Technically, I can't investigate until you rule Mr. Kelly's death either a homicide or suspicious circs."
13,00:01:14,00:01:16,I'll give you my tickets toLove.
14,00:01:16,00:01:18,"I've seen it, twice."
15,00:01:18,00:01:20,All right. (phone ringing)
16,00:01:22,00:01:24,I've got a call-- I'll meet you up there.
17,00:01:24,00:01:27,All right!
18,00:01:27,00:01:30,(thunder rumbling)
19,00:01:41,00:01:43,Okay. Sure.
20,00:01:43,00:01:45,"Mrs. Kelly, this is Catherine Willows Yeah..."
21,00:01:45,00:01:46,from the Crime Lab!
22,00:01:46,00:01:48,We spoke earlier!
23,00:01:50,00:01:51,(knocks)
24,00:01:51,00:01:53,(door creaks)
25,00:01:53,00:01:54,Mrs. Kelly?
26,00:01:54,00:01:56,Yeah?
27,00:01:57,00:02:01,"Mrs. Kelly, I'm, uh, Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab."
28,00:02:02,00:02:03,I left you a message.
29,00:02:03,00:02:04,(groans)
30,00:02:10,00:02:13,(crazed grunting)
31,00:02:15,00:02:17,(both grunting)
32,00:02:29,00:02:30,Catherine!
33,00:02:33,00:02:34,(grunting)
34,00:02:35,00:02:38,Catherine!
35,00:02:38,00:02:39,(both grunting)
36,00:02:39,00:02:42,(screaming)
37,00:02:46,00:02:47,(sighs)
38,00:02:47,00:02:49,(panting)
39,00:02:49,00:02:50,ROBBINS: Catherine!
40,00:02:50,00:02:52,(pounding on door) Are you okay?!
41,00:02:55,00:02:57,Thank God.
42,00:02:57,00:02:59,She jumped me.
43,00:02:59,00:03:03,I pulled my gun and she just collapsed.
44,00:03:03,00:03:05,(sighs)
45,00:03:08,00:03:12,She's dead... and you're bleeding.
46,00:03:14,00:03:16,That's better than the other way around.
47,00:03:49,00:03:51,(siren whooping)
48,00:03:51,00:03:52,BRASS: So I talked to the neighbors.
49,00:03:53,00:03:55,Nobody had anything bad to say about Mrs. Kelly.
50,00:03:55,00:03:56,"In fact, they all called her a saint."
51,00:03:56,00:04:01,"She's a special ed teacher; she's a friend to kids, stray dogs, and anybody with a problem."
52,00:04:01,00:04:03,"Well, I must have met her evil clone."
53,00:04:03,00:04:04,"BRASS: You know, there's a reason there's a protocol."
54,00:04:04,00:04:06,You should have called me first.
55,00:04:06,00:04:08,I was doing this as a favor to Doc.
56,00:04:08,00:04:11,"Yeah, this thing could have escalated easily and got out of hand."
57,00:04:12,00:04:13,"Next time, you call me."
58,00:04:13,00:04:15,"Yes, you're right."
59,00:04:15,00:04:17,I'm glad you're okay.
60,00:04:17,00:04:19,(sighs) Thank you.
61,00:04:19,00:04:20,How is she?
62,00:04:20,00:04:24,"Vitals are stable, but the attacker bit her, and she's not sure when she had her last tetanus shot."
63,00:04:24,00:04:25,Let me see.
64,00:04:25,00:04:28,I just called you so that you could work the case 'cause I'm a witness.
65,00:04:28,00:04:29,Nick's already inside.
66,00:04:29,00:04:31,"Catherine, don't be a tough guy."
67,00:04:31,00:04:33,"Jeff, get her to the hospital."
68,00:04:33,00:04:34,"Yes, sir."
69,00:04:45,00:04:46,"Evening, Professor."
70,00:04:47,00:04:49,Nick.
71,00:05:03,00:05:10,"""Extending deep and heartfelt sympathies in the death of your son Brent."" Darla Kelly's son died six days ago."
72,00:05:10,00:05:13,Thinking that's probably what drove her over the edge.
73,00:05:27,00:05:29,"(camera clicking, whirring)"
74,00:06:10,00:06:12,"Hey, check it out."
75,00:06:12,00:06:17,Found a baggy of meth in Brent's dresser and an empty one in the trash can.
76,00:06:17,00:06:18,Hmm.
77,00:06:18,00:06:22,Looks like he was a tweaker living in Mama's trailer.
78,00:06:22,00:06:27,"Meth can make you stronger, meaner, angry, paranoid."
79,00:06:27,00:06:33,"Maybe she was using, too, which would explain her behavior."
80,00:06:36,00:06:39,"(indistinct conversation, birds twittering)"
81,00:06:39,00:06:40,Hey.
82,00:06:40,00:06:41,I found her alive but unconscious.
83,00:06:42,00:06:43,Possible sexual assault.
84,00:06:44,00:06:46,"Got an I.D.? No purse, no wallet."
85,00:06:46,00:06:48,My guys are still knocking on doors.
86,00:06:49,00:06:52,"Found her pants and shoes next to the body, and the paramedics took this off her."
87,00:06:52,00:06:55,Who called it in?
88,00:06:55,00:06:56,"Uh, Mr. Murphy."
89,00:06:56,00:07:00,Claims that he found her lying under his truck when he was leaving for work.
90,00:07:04,00:07:06,His wife corroborated his story.
91,00:07:06,00:07:08,We'll see if it holds up.
92,00:07:09,00:07:13,Got some abrasions on the back of the shirt.
93,00:07:13,00:07:15,Couple of buttons missing on the front.
94,00:07:22,00:07:25,White substance on the pants.
95,00:07:25,00:07:27,Could be semen.
96,00:07:27,00:07:29,Dried blood pool.
97,00:07:29,00:07:31,She was probably out here for a while.
98,00:07:31,00:07:37,"Some blood drops on the box-- mostly horizontal, more than eight inches off the ground."
99,00:07:37,00:07:39,Somebody hit her when she was already down.
100,00:07:43,00:07:46,Maybe she was kicked under the truck.
101,00:07:53,00:07:55,SANDERS: Got a drag trail.
102,00:07:55,00:07:57,See where it leads.
103,00:08:01,00:08:02,(cracking)
104,00:08:34,00:08:35,(crackling)
105,00:08:41,00:08:43,Mrs. Kelly was such a nice lady.
106,00:08:43,00:08:46,She lost her health insurance when she went part-time at Marshall Creek Elementary.
107,00:08:46,00:08:48,Poor thing was always getting sick.
108,00:08:49,00:08:50,The warrant includes her son.
109,00:08:50,00:08:51,Was he a patient here as well?
110,00:08:51,00:08:52,Brent? Mm-hmm.
111,00:08:52,00:08:55,"Yeah, he came in a few times, feigning a back injury."
112,00:08:55,00:08:57,"Why is that, you think?"
113,00:08:57,00:08:59,He was trying to score some oxycodone.
114,00:08:59,00:09:02,"Mm. A couple weeks ago, Dr. Shaw had to forcibly remove him."
115,00:09:02,00:09:03,Really?
116,00:09:03,00:09:04,"I have his file, too."
117,00:09:05,00:09:09,He was a terrible human being.
118,00:09:09,00:09:15,"I used to suspect that he was abusing his mother, but when I asked Mrs. Kelly about it, she clammed right up."
119,00:09:15,00:09:23,"It says here that Mrs. Kelly called the clinic three days ago complaining of flu-like symptoms, and someone told her to take an analgesic and get some rest."
120,00:09:24,00:09:25,Does that sound right?
121,00:09:25,00:09:27,Do you think that contributed to her death?
122,00:09:27,00:09:30,"I don't know yet, but I'm gonna find out."
123,00:09:30,00:09:32,"(""Dead Shrimp Blues"" by Robert Johnson playing)"
124,00:09:34,00:09:47,(Robbins singing along): ♪ And all my shrimp was dead ♪ (chuckles)
125,00:09:47,00:09:51,"""Dead Shrimp Blues""-- Robert Johnson."
126,00:09:51,00:09:55,"Recorded Friday, November 27, 1936, San Antonio, Texas."
127,00:09:55,00:09:57,"The Gunter Hotel, three blocks from the Alamo."
128,00:09:57,00:09:58,You're a blues man!
129,00:09:59,00:10:00,Is fat meat greasy?
130,00:10:00,00:10:05,(laughs) I got this record in Chicago at the M.E.s' convention.
131,00:10:05,00:10:07,Guy let it go for 50 bucks.
132,00:10:07,00:10:08,The man didn't know what he had.
133,00:10:08,00:10:09,(music stops)
134,00:10:09,00:10:10,Is that the tox report?
135,00:10:10,00:10:11,Yes.
136,00:10:12,00:10:13,No drugs in her system.
137,00:10:13,00:10:14,Henry ran the panel twice.
138,00:10:14,00:10:15,ROBBINS: I don't get it.
139,00:10:15,00:10:18,This is my fourth undetermined this month.
140,00:10:18,00:10:20,Mrs. Kelly lived with her son.
141,00:10:20,00:10:22,Maybe you're looking for some kind of pathogen.
142,00:10:22,00:10:27,"Something infectious-- a virus, bacteria, microorganism?"
143,00:10:27,00:10:38,"I've already ruled out gonorrhea, viral hepatitis, syphilis, staphylococcus, atypical pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, influenza, West Nile, and SARS."
144,00:10:38,00:10:39,Then it has to be an exotic.
145,00:10:39,00:10:41,Hmm.
146,00:10:41,00:10:43,Did you hold the rest of the bodies?
147,00:10:43,00:10:45,Walk this way.
148,00:10:47,00:10:53,"Brent Kelly, 22, died Friday night after an unexplained seizure."
149,00:10:53,00:11:03,"Leeland Jacobs, 33, ex-con, died alone in his apartment, two weeks ago. Says here he displayed aggressive behavior prior to his death."
150,00:11:03,00:11:05,"Found cocaine in his system, but he didn't OD."
151,00:11:05,00:11:11,"Depending upon your genetic disposition, cocaine can trigger schizophrenia and heart failure."
152,00:11:11,00:11:12,It wasn't a heart failure.
153,00:11:12,00:11:14,I can't tell you if he was schizo.
154,00:11:14,00:11:17,We couldn't find any medical records.
155,00:11:17,00:11:18,Scotty Belinsky.
156,00:11:18,00:11:21,27. Died three weeks ago.
157,00:11:21,00:11:23,Found in his bathroom.
158,00:11:23,00:11:24,Another ex-con.
159,00:11:24,00:11:27,I had Brass run backgrounds on Belinsky and Jacobs.
160,00:11:28,00:11:29,No apparent connections.
161,00:11:29,00:11:33,"Well, do we know if either of them was connected to Brent Kelly? No."
162,00:11:33,00:11:37,The only thing that brings these three men together is body modification.
163,00:11:37,00:11:39,I see Mr. Kelly had ear gauges.
164,00:11:39,00:11:40,But you ain't seen nothing yet.
165,00:11:40,00:11:43,Help me roll him.
166,00:11:47,00:11:49,That is some serious modification.
167,00:11:49,00:11:51,Transdermal implants.
168,00:11:51,00:12:04,"It's done via a process called ""dermal punching."" Technician makes an incision, separates subcutis and fascia using a dermal elevator, creating a pocket where an implant's inserted-- typically steel or silicone bead."
169,00:12:04,00:12:10,"The skin fuses around the bead, creating the design, kind of like a Braille tattoo."
170,00:12:10,00:12:12,"So, maybe..."
171,00:12:12,00:12:15,all three of these men visited the same tattoo parlor.
172,00:12:15,00:12:18,Can't be many of them that do this kind of work.
173,00:12:51,00:12:52,(camera shutter clicking)
174,00:13:00,00:13:02,(grunting)
175,00:13:02,00:13:06,"MAN: So, you want me to take care of that?"
176,00:13:06,00:13:09,"Hey, Lou, did you do a knock and talk at this house?"
177,00:13:09,00:13:11,I'm just on my way over there now.
178,00:13:11,00:13:13,"LVPD. Yeah, uh..."
179,00:13:13,00:13:19,"What's going on? Ladies, I'm Detective Vartann. This is Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab."
180,00:13:19,00:13:20,A woman was attacked on your street last night.
181,00:13:20,00:13:22,We believe the victim might have come from this house.
182,00:13:22,00:13:25,"Oh, my God. Kayla."
183,00:13:25,00:13:26,She was here last night.
184,00:13:26,00:13:28,"Is, uh, this Kayla?"
185,00:13:31,00:13:32,Is she okay?
186,00:13:32,00:13:33,She's in the hospital.
187,00:13:34,00:13:35,What is Kayla's last name?
188,00:13:35,00:13:37,Nootens.
189,00:13:37,00:13:38,When was the last time you saw her?
190,00:13:38,00:13:39,Around 10:00.
191,00:13:39,00:13:46,"We had our diet club meeting, me, Diana, and Kayla. You know, we all entered the GME bikini contest."
192,00:13:46,00:13:47,GME?
193,00:13:47,00:13:49,God Made 'Em.
194,00:13:49,00:13:51,No fake boobs.
195,00:13:51,00:13:55,First prize is a trip for two to Hawaii.
196,00:13:55,00:13:56,"Yeah. Well, we meet here twice a week."
197,00:13:56,00:13:59,"We do our weigh in, and then we have our support dinner."
198,00:13:59,00:14:00,"So, I lost another two pounds."
199,00:14:00,00:14:02,"I was craving ice cream, but I went for a run instead."
200,00:14:03,00:14:05,"And it worked. Rub it in, why don't you?"
201,00:14:05,00:14:06,I lost zero pounds this week.
202,00:14:06,00:14:08,I'm never going to fit into my bikini.
203,00:14:08,00:14:10,Don't say that. We can do this.
204,00:14:10,00:14:11,And I am going to go to Maui.
205,00:14:11,00:14:13,"DIANA: If you win, will you take me?"
206,00:14:16,00:14:18,You said that Kayla left here around 10:00?
207,00:14:18,00:14:20,Did either of you walk her to her car?
208,00:14:20,00:14:24,"I was going to drive her home, but then it stopped raining, so she decided to walk."
209,00:14:24,00:14:29,"They say if you walk after dinner, it burns more fat."
210,00:14:29,00:14:30,Yeah.
211,00:14:30,00:14:34,"Um, do you know anyone who might want to hurt her?"
212,00:14:34,00:14:35,Her ex...
213,00:14:35,00:14:38,"BF. Yeah, they fought all the time."
214,00:14:38,00:14:40,D-bag.
215,00:14:40,00:14:41,He dumped her 'cause she gained 15 pounds.
216,00:14:41,00:14:48,And then he said that he would take her back if she won the contest and took him to Hawaii. Do you know her ex-BF's name?
217,00:14:48,00:14:51,"Um, Elvis Rodriguez."
218,00:14:51,00:14:54,(monitor beeping slowly)
219,00:14:57,00:14:59,(Willows groans)
220,00:14:59,00:15:02,The tetanus shot hurt more than the crazy lady attacking me.
221,00:15:02,00:15:04,You going to turn into a vampire now?
222,00:15:05,00:15:08,"Well, I already work nights, so I don't think anybody's going to notice."
223,00:15:08,00:15:09,(chuckles)
224,00:15:09,00:15:12,"I can't work the other case, so fill me in here."
225,00:15:12,00:15:14,Doctor says death is imminent. Mmm.
226,00:15:14,00:15:16,Wet mount was positive for semen.
227,00:15:16,00:15:18,And they found signs of sexual trauma.
228,00:15:19,00:15:20,Do you want to help me roll her?
229,00:15:25,00:15:30,"She's got road rash on her back, shoulders, and buttocks."
230,00:15:31,00:15:36,"Based on the depth of the abrasions, it looks like she was dragged a long way."
231,00:15:36,00:15:38,That's consistent with what we found at the scene.
232,00:15:40,00:15:45,"Now, this neck injury looks like a stab wound."
233,00:15:45,00:15:47,You swab it?
234,00:15:47,00:15:49,Nurse did. Found some trace inside the wound track.
235,00:15:49,00:15:51,It's with the SAE kit.
236,00:15:51,00:15:53,(alarm beeping)
237,00:15:55,00:15:57,"(flatline tone, staffers clamoring)"
238,00:15:57,00:15:59,Excuse me!
239,00:16:16,00:16:17,(panting)
240,00:16:18,00:16:19,STOKES: He does know you can't undo that.
241,00:16:19,00:16:21,Mmm. Doesn't he?
242,00:16:21,00:16:23,Self-mutilation trips me out.
243,00:16:23,00:16:25,LANGSTON: It's a form of rebellion.
244,00:16:25,00:16:28,I've witnessed a couple of botched tongue forkings in my time.
245,00:16:28,00:16:31,"STOKES: Yeah, and even if you make it through, you wind up with a..."
246,00:16:31,00:16:33,(slurring): speech impediment.
247,00:16:34,00:16:34,"Hey, guys."
248,00:16:35,00:16:36,Walk-ins always welcome.
249,00:16:36,00:16:40,We're actually running a special right now on matching tattoo hearts.
250,00:16:40,00:16:42,Or are you guys more into rough trade?
251,00:16:42,00:16:44,"Dude, we're CSI."
252,00:16:44,00:16:46,We're here on police business.
253,00:16:47,00:16:48,Are you the owner?
254,00:16:49,00:16:50,I wish.
255,00:16:50,00:16:53,"It's Jack's Body Shop, and my name is Eric."
256,00:16:53,00:16:54,Eric Tobin.
257,00:16:54,00:16:57,I'm the manager slash receptionist.
258,00:16:57,00:16:59,The man-ceptionist.
259,00:17:01,00:17:03,We need to speak with Jack.
260,00:17:03,00:17:06,Jack is in the back making one of his magic potions.
261,00:17:06,00:17:08,"Thank you, my man."
262,00:17:12,00:17:14,(needle buzzing)
263,00:17:14,00:17:18,"Boy, this is all kinds of wrong."
264,00:17:23,00:17:24,(Stokes clears throat)
265,00:17:24,00:17:27,Bathroom's in the front.
266,00:17:27,00:17:29,Are you Jack?
267,00:17:29,00:17:31,Crime Lab boys.
268,00:17:31,00:17:34,"Dr. Jack Shaw. What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
269,00:17:34,00:17:37,Are you the same Dr. Shaw that works the free clinic on Janville?
270,00:17:38,00:17:39,Guilty.
271,00:17:40,00:17:42,I assume you also know I'm a retired coroner from Reno.
272,00:17:42,00:17:44,I do now.
273,00:17:44,00:17:48,"So, how'd you go from being a coroner to owning this place?"
274,00:17:48,00:17:50,"Natural transition, actually."
275,00:17:50,00:17:53,Used to spend all day cutting up dead bodies and sticking them with needles.
276,00:17:53,00:17:55,"Today when I cut 'em, they bleed."
277,00:17:56,00:18:02,"Tell me, Doctor, do you know if any of these men has been in your shop recently?"
278,00:18:02,00:18:06,"I don't recognize the faces, but I do know the work."
279,00:18:06,00:18:09,There's sunflower yellow and iris blue in these tats.
280,00:18:09,00:18:11,"That's ""Van Gogh."" He mixes his own ink."
281,00:18:11,00:18:13,And he's the only one that does dermal implants.
282,00:18:13,00:18:14,What's his real name?
283,00:18:14,00:18:16,Carl Van Goe. Spelled G-O-E.
284,00:18:16,00:18:18,I swear to God.
285,00:18:18,00:18:19,Had it legally changed.
286,00:18:19,00:18:21,I fired him two weeks ago.
287,00:18:21,00:18:22,How come?
288,00:18:22,00:18:23,Artistic differences.
289,00:18:23,00:18:26,Customer would want a certain design.
290,00:18:26,00:18:36,"Van Goe would give them what he thought was right for their ""canvas."" You guys going to tell me what's going on?"
291,00:18:36,00:18:39,These three men all died of an infectious disease.
292,00:18:39,00:18:43,Seems that this place-- your shop-- is the only common link.
293,00:18:43,00:18:44,"Hey, I run a clean shop."
294,00:18:44,00:18:48,I give an antibiotic shot to anybody that's had an invasive procedure.
295,00:18:48,00:18:51,But Van Goe brings his own tools and needles.
296,00:18:51,00:18:53,We'd like to check him out.
297,00:18:53,00:18:58,"In the meantime, we're going to need your tools, needles, inks, and, uh, the biohazard bin."
298,00:18:58,00:18:59,Supply cabinet's up front.
299,00:19:00,00:19:01,Biohazard's out back.
300,00:19:01,00:19:03,It's all in the warrant.
301,00:19:05,00:19:06,"Uh, what pathogen do you suspect?"
302,00:19:07,00:19:08,Did I say it was a pathogen?
303,00:19:08,00:19:09,Retired coroner.
304,00:19:10,00:19:11,I'm assuming.
305,00:19:14,00:19:16,"SANDERS: So, Elvis, how'd you get these injuries?"
306,00:19:16,00:19:17,I'm a landscaper.
307,00:19:17,00:19:20,Got a lot of cactus orders 'cause of the drought.
308,00:19:20,00:19:23,"Or maybe they're from when you raped your ex, Kayla Nootens."
309,00:19:24,00:19:25,I didn't rape Kay.
310,00:19:25,00:19:26,We had sex.
311,00:19:26,00:19:27,Open up.
312,00:19:27,00:19:31,"You had the kind of sex where she said ""no."" Hold up. This is crazy."
313,00:19:31,00:19:32,Me and Kay broke up. Yeah.
314,00:19:32,00:19:34,Because you thought she was fat.
315,00:19:34,00:19:35,You ever seen her?
316,00:19:35,00:19:37,She used to look like a little coke bottle.
317,00:19:37,00:19:38,Then she got all messy in the middle.
318,00:19:38,00:19:40,I couldn't have that on my arm.
319,00:19:40,00:19:42,"So, when Kayla dropped a few l.b.'s, you wanted her back?"
320,00:19:42,00:19:44,"No, remember, he wanted a free trip to Hawaii."
321,00:19:44,00:19:46,"Oh, right. That's why I had sex with her."
322,00:19:46,00:19:47,To seal the deal.
323,00:19:47,00:19:48,She was easy that way.
324,00:19:48,00:19:50,And I needed a vacay.
325,00:19:50,00:19:51,What time was this?
326,00:19:51,00:19:53,Around 6:00 maybe.
327,00:19:53,00:19:57,"Then she went to go see some friends, and I had to go pick up my new girlfriend's kid from day care."
328,00:19:57,00:19:58,(sighs)
329,00:19:58,00:20:00,VARTANN: Where did you go after?
330,00:20:00,00:20:02,"I dropped the kid off, but my girlfriend was tired."
331,00:20:02,00:20:03,So I went home.
332,00:20:03,00:20:05,"Well, that means you don't have an alibi."
333,00:20:05,00:20:07,Why do I need an alibi for?
334,00:20:07,00:20:10,Because I'm charging you with the rape and murder of Kayla Nootens.
335,00:20:10,00:20:12,Congratulations.
336,00:20:12,00:20:15,You may have just won a 20-year vacay.
337,00:20:20,00:20:26,"(beeps) Hello, this is-- Don't say ""hello."" (beeps)"
338,00:20:26,00:20:27,Okay.
339,00:20:27,00:20:33,This is the first solo autopsy of Assistant Medical Examiner David Gregory Phillips.
340,00:20:33,00:20:35,Me.
341,00:20:35,00:20:38,Decedent is a Caucasian female.
342,00:20:38,00:20:39,Kayla Nootens.
343,00:20:39,00:20:41,Early 20s.
344,00:20:41,00:20:42,63 inches.
345,00:20:42,00:20:44,144 pounds. (beep)
346,00:20:52,00:20:55,"I don't have C.O.D. yet, so please don't ask."
347,00:20:55,00:20:56,You want some help? No.
348,00:20:56,00:20:58,I have to do this myself.
349,00:20:58,00:20:59,It's my first solo.
350,00:21:01,00:21:02,Sorry.
351,00:21:03,00:21:04,Didn't mean to lose my temper.
352,00:21:04,00:21:06,That was you losing your temper?
353,00:21:06,00:21:13,"My wife calls me a ""snapping alligator."" Well, your bad temper is better than my good one."
354,00:21:13,00:21:14,Did you examine her neck wound?
355,00:21:14,00:21:16,Of course I did.
356,00:21:16,00:21:18,She was stabbed.
357,00:21:18,00:21:19,I excised that from the wound.
358,00:21:19,00:21:21,What is it? I have no idea.
359,00:21:21,00:21:23,Maybe you could ask Hodges.
360,00:21:23,00:21:25,(sighs)
361,00:21:27,00:21:28,(groans)
362,00:21:28,00:21:32,"So, Mr. Van Goe, how come you still have both your ears?"
363,00:21:32,00:21:34,Got the name 'cause I cut off someone's ear lobe.
364,00:21:34,00:21:35,Accident.
365,00:21:35,00:21:37,It was my first year on the job.
366,00:21:37,00:21:38,Of course.
367,00:21:38,00:21:41,"So, where do you keep all your tools?"
368,00:21:41,00:21:42,"No, hey, hey, hey."
369,00:21:42,00:21:43,Where do you think you're going?
370,00:21:43,00:21:44,Stuff's in there. (chuckling): No.
371,00:21:44,00:21:45,He'll go look.
372,00:21:45,00:21:49,I need you to stay here and paint me a picture.
373,00:21:51,00:21:54,Did you do any work on these guys at Jack's Body Shop?
374,00:21:54,00:21:57,VAN GOE: I don't know. Why don't you ask Jack? I quit.
375,00:21:57,00:22:00,"So, you telling me that Shaw didn't fire you?"
376,00:22:00,00:22:02,He's a jackal and a philistine.
377,00:22:02,00:22:05,I quit. I took my clients with me.
378,00:22:05,00:22:07,I'm going to need a list of your clients.
379,00:22:07,00:22:08,I don't write anything down.
380,00:22:09,00:22:10,"Excuse me, Mr. Van Goe."
381,00:22:10,00:22:12,You been working out of your shed these days?
382,00:22:13,00:22:16,"You do know that's against the law, don't you?"
383,00:22:16,00:22:17,"Okay, let's start again."
384,00:22:17,00:22:18,Did you work on any of these guys?
385,00:22:18,00:22:20,"Either here, there, or anywhere?"
386,00:22:20,00:22:23,"Maybe. No, this is not multiple choice."
387,00:22:23,00:22:24,It's either yes or no.
388,00:22:24,00:22:26,Or.
389,00:22:26,00:22:27,"BRASS: Okay, it's gonna be one of those days, I guess."
390,00:22:27,00:22:28,"All right, look, Scotty, wrap him up."
391,00:22:28,00:22:29,"Come on, let's go."
392,00:22:29,00:22:32,We'll do this some other place.
393,00:22:46,00:22:48,Damn it.
394,00:22:48,00:22:52,Virology results from the tattoo parlor.
395,00:22:52,00:22:55,"No detectable contaminants, poisons or pathogens."
396,00:22:55,00:22:57,Maybe something will turn up in the Van Goe shed.
397,00:22:57,00:22:59,Can we go over it one more time?
398,00:22:59,00:23:01,Yeah.
399,00:23:01,00:23:04,Starting with the most recent victim.
400,00:23:05,00:23:08,Darla Kelly gave her dying son CPR.
401,00:23:08,00:23:12,"Three days later she complains of a sore throat, fatigue and a low-grade fever."
402,00:23:12,00:23:15,"Three days after that, she attacks Catherine and drops dead."
403,00:23:15,00:23:20,"Right, her counts are normal, white blood cells unaffected, which tells us it's not bacterial."
404,00:23:20,00:23:22,"If it's not in the blood, it has to be the tissue."
405,00:23:22,00:23:25,Certain organisms have different rates of crossing the blood-brain barrier.
406,00:23:25,00:23:27,Histology was negative.
407,00:23:27,00:23:31,"Muscle, tissue, brain, organs."
408,00:23:31,00:23:33,But the lab only checked for common pathogens.
409,00:23:33,00:23:37,Let's take a look at Darla Kelly's brain tissue.
410,00:23:38,00:23:40,LANGSTON: Bottom right quadrant.
411,00:23:40,00:23:41,Is that a Negri body?
412,00:23:41,00:23:43,That's what I'm thinking.
413,00:23:43,00:23:45,I haven't seen one of those since medical school.
414,00:24:00,00:24:02,"I have another one here, Doctor."
415,00:24:02,00:24:05,There are Negri bodies in each victim's brain tissue.
416,00:24:08,00:24:09,It's rabies. Yes.
417,00:24:09,00:24:14,"No one's died of rabies in Nevada in over 90 years, and now we have four in a month."
418,00:24:14,00:24:18,Rabies would explain Darla Kelly's flu-like symptoms.
419,00:24:18,00:24:20,It was raining that night.
420,00:24:20,00:24:22,"Rabies can cause hydrophobia, intense fear of water."
421,00:24:22,00:24:25,Maybe it triggered her violent behavior.
422,00:24:25,00:24:26,And rabies is carried in the saliva.
423,00:24:26,00:24:28,Mrs. Kelly had a cold sore.
424,00:24:28,00:24:38,"ROBBINS: The virus travels through connective tissue into the muscle, goes up into the neuronal cells of the brain stem and into the limbic cortex."
425,00:24:38,00:24:47,"The most common form of rabies virus transmission is through the bite or the virus-containing saliva of an infected host, which is almost always a rabid animal."
426,00:24:47,00:24:52,"Now, none of the victims had bite marks, and no one reported being bitten."
427,00:24:53,00:24:55,Someone was bitten.
428,00:24:55,00:24:56,Catherine.
429,00:25:03,00:25:05,What's wrong?
430,00:25:05,00:25:08,"Uh, we have C.O.D. on Darla Kelly."
431,00:25:08,00:25:09,It's rabies.
432,00:25:12,00:25:15,"Okay, uh, so, what?"
433,00:25:15,00:25:17,I'll get a shot and be fine.
434,00:25:17,00:25:20,Human rabies cases are very rare.
435,00:25:20,00:25:25,"The treatment is extremely expensive, which is why the state doesn't have any available."
436,00:25:25,00:25:30,"Okay, so, you're telling me that there aren't any available shots in the entire state of Nevada?!"
437,00:25:31,00:25:36,"If the treatment is administered within the first 72 hours of transmission, you should be fine."
438,00:25:36,00:25:37,It's already been more than 24.
439,00:25:37,00:25:39,And we've located a supply; it's in Atlanta.
440,00:25:40,00:25:42,Atlanta?! Georgia.
441,00:25:42,00:25:44,You'll need a test to confirm whether you've got it.
442,00:25:44,00:25:47,And I'm taking you to the hospital right now.
443,00:25:47,00:25:50,I... I need to call Nick.
444,00:25:50,00:25:51,Let him know he's the acting supervisor.
445,00:25:51,00:25:52,Use your cell phone.
446,00:26:09,00:26:12,At least give me a hint. I wish I could.
447,00:26:12,00:26:15,But Dr. Robbins has to review and sign off on my work first.
448,00:26:15,00:26:16,"Okay, well, where is he?"
449,00:26:16,00:26:17,The hospital.
450,00:26:17,00:26:18,Visiting Catherine.
451,00:26:18,00:26:21,He must be feeling really guilty.
452,00:26:25,00:26:30,"Okay, the rape victim who was dragged. Uh, Kayla Nootens."
453,00:26:30,00:26:31,Go.
454,00:26:31,00:26:36,"Okay, uh, decedent sustained a half-inch deep stab wound to the right side of her neck."
455,00:26:36,00:26:38,It nicked her vertebral artery.
456,00:26:38,00:26:40,C.O.D. is exsanguination.
457,00:26:40,00:26:42,"This wound is minor, David."
458,00:26:42,00:26:43,She's a young woman.
459,00:26:44,00:26:45,Blood would have clotted within minutes.
460,00:26:45,00:26:51,"Yes, sir, however, I discovered that she was severely anemic and had excessive levels of caffeine in her system."
461,00:26:51,00:26:55,Both of which contributed to blood thinning and compromised her clotting factors.
462,00:26:55,00:26:57,Common indicators of anorexia.
463,00:26:57,00:26:59,Or extreme dieting.
464,00:26:59,00:27:02,Her and her friends were trying to win a bikini contest.
465,00:27:03,00:27:08,"So, my proposed C.O.D. is exsanguination with additional complicating factors preventing clotting."
466,00:27:10,00:27:11,Well described.
467,00:27:11,00:27:13,I concur.
468,00:27:17,00:27:20,Catherine just got her prophylaxis shots.
469,00:27:20,00:27:22,She's doing fine.
470,00:27:22,00:27:23,That's good to hear.
471,00:27:23,00:27:25,What have you got?
472,00:27:25,00:27:33,"Well, virology confirmed that all four victims died of a, uh, rabies virus variant associated with T. Brasiliensis."
473,00:27:33,00:27:35,The Mexican Free Tailed Bat.
474,00:27:35,00:27:38,We didn't find any evidence of bats at the mobile home park.
475,00:27:38,00:27:41,And two of the victims died in apartments off the strip.
476,00:27:41,00:27:45,"So, what's our theory?"
477,00:27:45,00:27:48,"I mean, did all these people go spelunking in Lehman Caves or what?"
478,00:27:48,00:27:50,They charge admission there.
479,00:27:50,00:27:53,"So, I checked their guest books and their receipts."
480,00:27:53,00:27:54,None of our victims were there.
481,00:27:54,00:27:58,"I called CDC, I asked for all their files on rabies transmissions."
482,00:27:58,00:28:02,"Most of it was, uh, straight-up ""hunter bitten by fox"" stuff."
483,00:28:02,00:28:04,But this one did stand out.
484,00:28:04,00:28:06,STOKES: That's redacted.
485,00:28:06,00:28:09,That usually means there was a lawsuit with a confidential settlement.
486,00:28:09,00:28:13,Doc Robbins says there hasn't been a rabies death in Nevada in nearly a century.
487,00:28:13,00:28:16,"But from what I can piece together, that may not be true."
488,00:28:16,00:28:21,A patient up in Reno tested positive for rabies after a liver transplant.
489,00:28:21,00:28:23,But doesn't say if she died or not.
490,00:28:23,00:28:25,"If her liver was infected, she's dead."
491,00:28:25,00:28:32,"If the donor was local, that means that the Reno Coroner had to clear the body before they could harvest the organs."
492,00:28:32,00:28:35,I guess he must've missed it.
493,00:28:35,00:28:38,Yeah.
494,00:28:38,00:28:39,What about Dr. Shaw?
495,00:28:39,00:28:40,He's a coroner.
496,00:28:40,00:28:43,I know this happened three years ago.
497,00:28:43,00:28:47,"I don't know how many they had working in Reno back then, but we do know him."
498,00:28:47,00:28:52,"Brent Kelly, Scott Belinsky and Leeland Jacobs all went to this guy's tattoo parlor."
499,00:28:52,00:28:56,And both the Kellys were treated by him at the Free Clinic.
500,00:28:56,00:28:57,Your victim was a messy eater.
501,00:28:57,00:28:59,Not too proficient with a fork.
502,00:28:59,00:29:03,The white substance on the clothes is not semen.
503,00:29:03,00:29:06,"It's potatoes, butter, milk and a pinch of garlic."
504,00:29:06,00:29:08,Mashed potatoes? Mm-hmm.
505,00:29:09,00:29:11,She was cheating on her diet.
506,00:29:11,00:29:12,More like a food orgy.
507,00:29:13,00:29:17,"The trace on the neck wound showed apple, cinnamon and grease."
508,00:29:17,00:29:19,What about the fragment David extracted?
509,00:29:19,00:29:21,"Well, that would be the main course."
510,00:29:21,00:29:22,It was animal bone.
511,00:29:23,00:29:27,"Although it was too small for me to identify the species, I think we know it's pretty obvious."
512,00:29:29,00:29:31,Babe.
513,00:29:31,00:29:32,Wilbur?
514,00:29:33,00:29:35,Pork.
515,00:29:35,00:29:36,"Yes, the other white meat."
516,00:29:36,00:29:39,That's the only type of flesh that you would season that way.
517,00:29:40,00:29:42,"Suddenly, I'm very hungry."
518,00:29:42,00:29:43,Break time.
519,00:29:44,00:29:46,"Hold on there, spuds."
520,00:29:46,00:29:48,How much do you weigh?
521,00:29:48,00:29:49,"Uh, excuse you."
522,00:29:50,00:29:50,That's not public information.
523,00:29:51,00:29:54,I'd say a buck 45.
524,00:29:54,00:29:56,Same as our victim.
525,00:29:56,00:30:01,We know Kayla Nootens was dragged face-up because her back was abraded.
526,00:30:01,00:30:06,"So, if the killer (grunting with effort): dragged her like this..."
527,00:30:06,00:30:07,Her back wouldn't be abraded.
528,00:30:08,00:30:12,"Right. Okay, what if the killer dragged her like this?"
529,00:30:12,00:30:13,"Ow, hey!"
530,00:30:14,00:30:16,"Easy, killer."
531,00:30:16,00:30:18,Hodges' calves are touching the floor.
532,00:30:18,00:30:20,Vic had no abrasions from the knees down.
533,00:30:20,00:30:23,There must've been two of them.
534,00:30:28,00:30:30,Yep.
535,00:30:30,00:30:32,Elvis had a friend.
536,00:30:32,00:30:36,Um... if I may...
537,00:30:36,00:30:43,"Wouldn't two men, one of whom being a cactus-hauling desert landscaper, just be able to pick me up and carry me?"
538,00:30:43,00:30:44,Or... her?
539,00:30:45,00:30:48,First rule of diet club...
540,00:30:48,00:30:50,Don't talk about diet club.
541,00:30:50,00:30:51,The whole thing was Rhonda's fault.
542,00:30:51,00:30:54,She was sabotaging Kayla's diet because she'd lost the most weight.
543,00:30:54,00:30:56,That is so not true!
544,00:30:56,00:30:58,Kayla was fatter than me.
545,00:30:58,00:31:00,"So, of course she lost more weight."
546,00:31:00,00:31:03,"Anyway, Kayla is the one that started it."
547,00:31:03,00:31:05,These mashed potatoes are amazing.
548,00:31:05,00:31:06,What kind of butter substitute did you use?
549,00:31:07,00:31:08,Mine suck.
550,00:31:09,00:31:10,(Rhonda clearing throat)
551,00:31:14,00:31:15,Hers are watery.
552,00:31:15,00:31:17,"Oh, my God."
553,00:31:17,00:31:18,You bitch.
554,00:31:21,00:31:24,You are the bitch!
555,00:31:24,00:31:28,You were going to ditch me for your ugly ex-BF and take him to Hawaii!
556,00:31:28,00:31:30,You're both bitches!
557,00:31:30,00:31:31,(women screaming)
558,00:31:31,00:31:35,Kayla would still be alive if Rhonda hadn't whipped that pork chop at her.
559,00:31:36,00:31:39,(girls screaming)
560,00:31:44,00:31:46,(gasping)
561,00:31:47,00:31:49,You are going to jail!
562,00:31:49,00:31:53,And you will always have a fat ass!
563,00:31:53,00:31:56,"Rhonda lost it, chased her down."
564,00:31:58,00:31:59,She dropped dead right there.
565,00:31:59,00:32:03,I didn't know that you could kill somebody with a pork chop.
566,00:32:03,00:32:08,But it was Diana's idea to drag the body under the truck and then pin the whole thing on Elvis.
567,00:32:22,00:32:27,Kayla wasn't dead when you were kicking her under the truck.
568,00:32:27,00:32:31,She bled to death because you left her there.
569,00:32:38,00:32:40,"I'm telling you, I didn't kill anybody."
570,00:32:40,00:32:41,"Okay, we got it, Doc, let's go."
571,00:32:41,00:32:42,"Want me to call your girlfriend? Hey, hey, hey!"
572,00:32:42,00:32:43,"Back off, back off."
573,00:32:43,00:32:45,"Hey, I got your back, I believe you!"
574,00:32:45,00:32:47,Stay strong.
575,00:32:47,00:32:49,"Hey, take it easy. (groans)"
576,00:32:50,00:32:51,Call 911.
577,00:32:53,00:32:54,"Hey, bud."
578,00:32:54,00:32:55,"Huh? Hey, bud."
579,00:32:55,00:32:56,Did I just pass out again?
580,00:32:57,00:32:58,"Stay, stay back."
581,00:32:59,00:33:00,How you feeling?
582,00:33:00,00:33:01,I'm fine.
583,00:33:01,00:33:04,I just... I haven't been feeling too good since I got my nipples pierced.
584,00:33:05,00:33:09,"Dr. Shaw gave me a shot of antibiotics, but I probably just got an infection anyway."
585,00:33:09,00:33:10,When did you get the shot?
586,00:33:10,00:33:12,A couple days ago.
587,00:33:22,00:33:24,I don't know-- it's a setup.
588,00:33:24,00:33:25,I'm being framed. BRASS: Who framed you?
589,00:33:25,00:33:27,Roger Rabbit? Maybe Van Goe.
590,00:33:27,00:33:28,He's a crazy bastard.
591,00:33:28,00:33:30,He threatened me when I fired him.
592,00:33:30,00:33:31,"So, how does this frame-up play out?"
593,00:33:31,00:33:36,Van Goe breaks into your shop wearing a Dr. Shaw mask and pokes Tobin with a rabid needle?
594,00:33:36,00:33:38,I'm not denying I gave Eric an antibiotic shot.
595,00:33:38,00:33:41,He had a piercing-- that's SOP at my shop.
596,00:33:41,00:33:43,"You know, somebody's lying in this room."
597,00:33:43,00:33:46,"And it's not me, and it's not him, 'cause he just got here."
598,00:33:50,00:33:57,"Three years ago, in Reno, a transplant recipient died from a donor liver that tested positive for rabies."
599,00:33:57,00:33:59,SHAW: I was the M.E.
600,00:33:59,00:34:00,on the donor's autopsy.
601,00:34:00,00:34:01,I ruled it a natural.
602,00:34:01,00:34:02,There was an investigation.
603,00:34:02,00:34:03,I was cleared.
604,00:34:03,00:34:06,Rabies detection is not part of the organ review.
605,00:34:06,00:34:09,"So, this isn't your first dance around the rabies game."
606,00:34:09,00:34:11,"Did you give the donor an antibiotic shot, too?"
607,00:34:11,00:34:17,The victim's family later admitted that he had been bitten by a raccoon six weeks before he died.
608,00:34:17,00:34:20,"Well, maybe Rocky Raccoon framed you."
609,00:34:20,00:34:23,I'd like to end this interview and call a lawyer.
610,00:34:25,00:34:27,"(White Stripes' ""Baby Brother"" playing)"
611,00:35:00,00:35:02,STOKES: Miss Schiff?
612,00:35:02,00:35:03,Hi. Hi.
613,00:35:03,00:35:04,Can I help you with something?
614,00:35:04,00:35:06,"Uh, no, but I think I can help you."
615,00:35:06,00:35:08,I found this in the trash at Dr. Shaw's house.
616,00:35:08,00:35:11,What were you doing at his house?
617,00:35:11,00:35:12,"Mr. Stokes, I'm..."
618,00:35:12,00:35:15,"embarrassed to admit it, but we were dating."
619,00:35:15,00:35:17,I-I didn't see it.
620,00:35:17,00:35:20,I had no idea that he's this monster.
621,00:35:20,00:35:21,I saw him take it out of his briefcase.
622,00:35:21,00:35:23,These are the same bags we use at the clinic.
623,00:35:23,00:35:25,I don't think it belongs to a patient.
624,00:35:25,00:35:26,Did you ask him about it?
625,00:35:26,00:35:29,He gets angry if I ask him any questions.
626,00:35:29,00:35:32,Just please don't tell him that I gave it to you.
627,00:35:32,00:35:34,All right.
628,00:35:34,00:35:36,Thanks.
629,00:35:38,00:35:39,(clears throat) Hi.
630,00:35:40,00:35:43,"I need to know what this is, and then get the bag to Prints right away."
631,00:35:43,00:35:46,"Well, it looks like it's some kind of tissue."
632,00:35:46,00:35:48,"Yeah, you might want to double-glove."
633,00:35:48,00:35:53,"I think Dr. Shaw's been cutting up rabid animals, making some sort of a rabies potion."
634,00:35:55,00:35:58,I will sample DNA and run a species determination.
635,00:35:58,00:36:02,"Also, I found Eric Tobin's needle, and virology confirmed that it tested positive for rabies."
636,00:36:02,00:36:04,Any DNA on the syringe? Yeah.
637,00:36:04,00:36:08,I just don't know if it's a match to Shaw yet 'cause Langston just dropped off the exemplar on his way out of town.
638,00:36:09,00:36:11,Out of town?
639,00:36:14,00:36:16,(blues music playing over stereo)
640,00:36:16,00:36:18,Did you tell Nick what we're doing?
641,00:36:18,00:36:22,"I did not tell Nick what we were doing, just in case things don't go according to plan."
642,00:36:22,00:36:23,Gives him plausible deniability.
643,00:36:23,00:36:25,Correct.
644,00:36:25,00:36:28,"You know, we're kind of screwed if the hospital doesn't have hard copies of the documents."
645,00:36:28,00:36:29,Mm-hmm.
646,00:36:30,00:36:34,Good thing being a doctor has more advantages than just getting hot chicks.
647,00:36:34,00:36:36,(chuckling)
648,00:36:38,00:36:40,Is that Mississippi John Hurt?
649,00:36:40,00:36:41,No.
650,00:36:43,00:36:46,"Recorded January, 1932."
651,00:36:46,00:36:47,"Grafton, Wisconsin."
652,00:36:47,00:36:49,Shoot me a title.
653,00:36:49,00:36:53,"My dear doctor, we are traveling to Reno on the Gone Dead Train."
654,00:36:54,00:36:56,King Solomon Hill. Ah.
655,00:36:56,00:36:57,Born...
656,00:36:58,00:37:00,Joe Holmes. Thank you.
657,00:37:00,00:37:02,(both laughing)
658,00:37:07,00:37:08,Hello. Hello.
659,00:37:08,00:37:10,"Uh, Frank, how are you today?"
660,00:37:10,00:37:12,Never seen you guys before.
661,00:37:12,00:37:14,Are you attendings or surgeons?
662,00:37:14,00:37:17,"We're researchers. ROBBINS: Yeah, we're from, uh, Saint Ann's."
663,00:37:17,00:37:20,"Uh, we're doing research for the, uh..."
664,00:37:20,00:37:22,for the cardinal.
665,00:37:22,00:37:23,"Not the, uh, team in Arizona."
666,00:37:23,00:37:26,"The, uh, guy who wears the pointy red hat, cardinal."
667,00:37:26,00:37:28,"Medical I.D.'s, please."
668,00:37:30,00:37:39,"You're not allowed to remove any files from this room, photocopy any files without permission, mutilate or destroy any files."
669,00:37:39,00:37:40,Got it...
670,00:37:41,00:37:42,Ebony and Ivory?
671,00:37:43,00:37:45,"ROBBINS: Yeah, we..."
672,00:37:45,00:37:47,"we got it, Frank."
673,00:37:50,00:37:51,"Next time, you don't talk."
674,00:37:51,00:37:53,I don't talk? I don't thinkyoushould talk.
675,00:37:53,00:37:56,"So, we have a liver transplant."
676,00:37:56,00:37:58,Recipient was Sandra Williams.
677,00:37:58,00:38:01,This patient did well immediately after transplantation.
678,00:38:01,00:38:05,Discharged on postoperative day five.
679,00:38:05,00:38:11,"21 days after transplant, she was readmitted with tremors, lethargy and anorexia."
680,00:38:12,00:38:16,"During the next 48 hours, her mental status deteriorated."
681,00:38:16,00:38:17,She subsequently died.
682,00:38:17,00:38:19,Initial diagnosis was encephalitis. Hmm.
683,00:38:19,00:38:29,"Well, it says here that the recipient's husband, Eric Tobin, filed a lawsuit against the hospital and its medical personnel."
684,00:38:29,00:38:30,Not surprising.
685,00:38:30,00:38:32,Did you sayEricTobin?
686,00:38:32,00:38:33,Mm-hmm.
687,00:38:33,00:38:38,"ERIC: It's, uh, Jack's Body Shop, and my name is Eric-- Eric Tobin."
688,00:38:38,00:38:43,"What, you don't think he's some sort of mastermind that framed Dr. Shaw, do you?"
689,00:38:43,00:38:44,"I mean, come on, Ray, you met him."
690,00:38:44,00:38:46,He's not even the master of his own mind.
691,00:38:46,00:38:47,"He has motive, Nick."
692,00:38:47,00:38:49,He blames Shaw for his wife's death.
693,00:38:49,00:38:51,Tobin won a malpractice suit.
694,00:38:51,00:38:52,That's big bucks.
695,00:38:52,00:38:55,The only reason he'd work at the shop is for revenge.
696,00:38:55,00:38:59,"Well, gentlemen, all of the physical evidence points to Dr. Shaw."
697,00:38:59,00:39:02,Wendy found his touch DNA on the syringe that infected Tobin.
698,00:39:02,00:39:12,"And while you two were out playing Smokey and the Bandit, his girlfriend, who's also a nurse at the clinic, brought me something he was trying to get rid of: a salivary gland from a rabid bat."
699,00:39:12,00:39:15,I think that's what he used to make the virus.
700,00:39:15,00:39:22,"Rabid bats are easy to spot because they stay within reach, even when a human enters their cave."
701,00:39:22,00:39:28,All he had to do was extract the saliva and add a preservative to keep the rabies virus viable.
702,00:39:28,00:39:33,"Look, I don't know how Tobin plays into all this, but Shaw is still our best suspect."
703,00:39:33,00:39:39,"Besides, it takes technical skill and knowledge to extract the rabies virus like that."
704,00:39:39,00:39:42,Then Tobin isn't working alone.
705,00:39:42,00:39:43,He's partnered with a mastermind.
706,00:39:44,00:39:47,"You said Shaw's girlfriend is a nurse, and she brought you that evidence."
707,00:39:47,00:39:49,I'm suspicious of anybody who brings me anything.
708,00:39:49,00:39:52,I ran Susan Schiff through the system.
709,00:39:52,00:39:53,There was no criminal record.
710,00:39:53,00:39:55,She could still be lying.
711,00:39:55,00:39:56,Maybe there's another connection.
712,00:39:56,00:39:59,Did Susan Schiff live in Reno?
713,00:39:59,00:40:00,Run her Social.
714,00:40:13,00:40:14,(computer beeping)
715,00:40:19,00:40:21,Susan Schiff...
716,00:40:21,00:40:23,also known as Susan Williams.
717,00:40:23,00:40:25,The woman who died in Reno...
718,00:40:25,00:40:28,her name was Sandra Williams.
719,00:40:28,00:40:31,My daughter was on the transplant list for a year.
720,00:40:31,00:40:34,Sandy was so excited when her name finally came up.
721,00:40:34,00:40:36,She and Eric started planning for their future.
722,00:40:36,00:40:39,She wanted to have a baby.
723,00:40:39,00:40:44,"But because of Dr. Shaw and his negligence, what she got was 21 days of hell."
724,00:40:44,00:40:45,You ever seen somebody die of rabies?
725,00:40:45,00:40:48,I've seen people die all kinds of ways.
726,00:40:48,00:40:55,I understand he made a fatal mistake-- I really do-- but that doesn't give you the right to kill four innocent people.
727,00:40:55,00:40:57,Those men weren't innocent.
728,00:40:57,00:40:59,They were a different kind of virus.
729,00:40:59,00:41:04,"I told you when we met, Brent Kelly was a low-life drug dealer who beat up his own mother."
730,00:41:04,00:41:06,"And the other two, Eric chose."
731,00:41:06,00:41:12,Those guys would come into the shop and brag about selling drugs to kids and having sex with minors.
732,00:41:12,00:41:15,Where were you guys?
733,00:41:15,00:41:16,"You know, I'm a little confused, Batman."
734,00:41:16,00:41:20,Was your mission to avenge your wife's death or rid Gotham of scumbags?
735,00:41:20,00:41:21,STOKES: What about Darla Kelly?
736,00:41:21,00:41:24,She was innocent.
737,00:41:24,00:41:25,I thought you liked her.
738,00:41:26,00:41:27,That one's on Brent.
739,00:41:27,00:41:29,I always knew he'd kill her someday.
740,00:41:29,00:41:31,What about your son-in-law?
741,00:41:31,00:41:32,I volunteered.
742,00:41:32,00:41:33,You hadn't arrested Shaw yet.
743,00:41:34,00:41:35,Plus...
744,00:41:35,00:41:38,Sue wasn't going to let me die.
745,00:41:38,00:41:39,I'm not stupid.
746,00:41:39,00:41:40,Not anymore.
747,00:41:40,00:41:41,How did you pull it off?
748,00:41:41,00:41:43,I got a piercing.
749,00:41:45,00:41:48,I knew that Dr. Shaw would give me a shot of antibiotics.
750,00:41:48,00:41:49,That's his SOP.
751,00:41:49,00:41:52,Sue gave me a vial of the virus.
752,00:41:52,00:41:54,I slapped on a label.
753,00:41:54,00:42:00,"Susan, you don't get to play God because your daughter died-- that's not the way it works."
754,00:42:00,00:42:03,Dr. Shaw didn't just kill my little girl.
755,00:42:03,00:42:05,He killed my whole family.
756,00:42:05,00:42:08,"My sons, my parents, my marriage."
757,00:42:08,00:42:09,Eric.
758,00:42:09,00:42:12,We all died that day.
759,00:42:12,00:42:15,And Dr. Shaw didn't lose anything.
760,00:42:15,00:42:18,And that's just wrong.
761,00:42:25,00:42:27,You wanted to see me.
762,00:42:27,00:42:29,Wanted to thank you.
763,00:42:29,00:42:30,What for?
764,00:42:30,00:42:32,For believing in my innocence.
765,00:42:32,00:42:35,I just didn't assume you were guilty.
766,00:42:36,00:42:40,"You know, I was good-- really good-- at my job."
767,00:42:40,00:42:42,I just wasn't good enough.
768,00:42:42,00:42:44,"I understand, Doctor."
769,00:42:44,00:42:46,I've been there.
770,00:43:09,00:43:11,Remember that solid you owe me?
771,00:43:11,00:43:13,(sighs)
772,00:43:13,00:43:16,"It's going to take more than show tickets, isn't it?"
773,00:43:17,00:43:18,"Oh, yeah."
