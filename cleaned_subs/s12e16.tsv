0	00:00:16	00:00:18	What do you see in the sky, Harper?
1	00:00:18	00:00:19	Planets.
2	00:00:19	00:00:21	The red one is Mars.
3	00:00:21	00:00:25	The one with the rings around is called Saturn.
4	00:00:25	00:00:28	And the smallest one is Pluto.
5	00:00:28	00:00:30	Oh, my little astronomer, it's time to go to bed now.
6	00:00:30	00:00:31	Okay.
7	00:01:26	00:01:28	Okay, we have a reported kidnapping.
8	00:01:28	00:01:30	A five-year-old boy, Harper Riordan.
9	00:01:30	00:01:34	His nanny, Shelby Buress, is also missing.
10	00:01:34	00:01:36	What about the parents?
11	00:01:36	00:01:37	Uh, parent. Single dad.
12	00:01:37	00:01:39	A T.C. Riordan.
13	00:01:39	00:01:42	Said he was sleeping when the nanny put the kid to bed.
14	00:01:42	00:01:43	What time was that?
15	00:01:43	00:01:44	00.
16	00:01:44	00:01:46	30, went to check in on the boy.
17	00:01:46	00:01:48	Did he make the 911 call?
18	00:01:48	00:01:51	35.
19	00:01:51	00:01:52	Half past midnight.
20	00:01:52	00:01:54	Clock's got the head start on us.
21	00:01:58	00:02:02	Didn't you just say he was asleep at the time of the abduction?
22	00:02:02	00:02:04	Yeah.
23	00:02:04	00:02:06	Is that how you dress for bed?
24	00:02:06	00:02:08	I dress a little less formally.
25	00:02:08	00:02:11	Where's the boy's room?
26	00:02:11	00:02:12	Upstairs.
27	00:02:25	00:02:27	Okay, got some blood.
28	00:02:27	00:02:30	Not a lot of it. Definitely a struggle.
29	00:02:35	00:02:36	Blood's tacky.
30	00:02:36	00:02:38	Consistent with the dad's timeline.
31	00:02:42	00:02:46	I got a print... in blood.
32	00:02:46	00:02:48	Definitely not a five-year-old's.
33	00:02:48	00:02:50	Our kidnapper, maybe?
34	00:03:00	00:03:02	Morgan, yeah, I'm sending you a print.
35	00:03:02	00:03:03	I want you to run it.
36	00:03:03	00:03:05	I'm on it.
37	00:03:13	00:03:15	Look at that.
38	00:03:15	00:03:17	Blood on the ceiling.
39	00:03:17	00:03:19	No, Saturn's missing.
40	00:03:23	00:03:24	Metal particles.
41	00:03:24	00:03:26	Could be transfer from the kidnapper.
42	00:03:29	00:03:30	Okay, I gotta get that back to the lab.
43	00:03:30	00:03:33	Why don't you have Hodges come pick it up?
44	00:03:33	00:03:35	I need you here.
45	00:03:35	00:03:36	Hey, evidence coming through!
46	00:03:36	00:03:37	Hold the door! Hold the door!
47	00:03:45	00:03:48	What part of Hold the door don't you understand?
48	00:03:48	00:03:49	I understood all of it.
49	00:04:09	00:04:11	Oh, brother.
50	00:04:11	00:04:12	Oh, that is not good.
51	00:04:12	00:04:13	It's not.
52	00:04:13	00:04:16	A storm blew out three generating stations.
53	00:04:16	00:04:17	Power is out in half the state.
54	00:04:17	00:04:19	They say for how long?
55	00:04:19	00:04:21	Could be a while.
56	00:04:21	00:04:22	God, we already lost enough time.
57	00:04:22	00:04:24	You know the rule.
58	00:04:24	00:04:26	If we don't find this kid in three hours, he's dead.
59	00:04:26	00:04:30	If the lights don't come back on, we'll find the kid in the dark.
60	00:05:06	00:05:08	Make sure the backup generator's running.
61	00:05:08	00:05:10	And check the freezers.
62	00:05:10	00:05:13	If we melt evidence, bad guys walk.
63	00:05:13	00:05:14	And lock down the guns in Ballistics.
64	00:05:14	00:05:17	Generator, freezer, guns.
65	00:05:17	00:05:18	Copy that.
66	00:05:18	00:05:19	All right.
67	00:05:19	00:05:21	FYI, AFIS is out.
68	00:05:21	00:05:22	So is CODIS and IBIS.
69	00:05:22	00:05:24	Basically, all the IS'es are down.
70	00:05:24	00:05:26	We're just gonna have to get used to it.
71	00:05:26	00:05:29	Until the lights come back on, we might as well be back in grad school.
72	00:05:29	00:05:31	Remember your basic chemistry.
73	00:05:31	00:05:33	Use your head, use your hands.
74	00:05:33	00:05:37	And these cell phone batteries, they're our only lifeline, so let's not waste 'em.
75	00:05:37	00:05:41	We got a missing boy and a nanny in the wind and we don't have much time.
76	00:05:41	00:05:43	Head and hands. Got it.
77	00:05:43	00:05:44	I got another call.
78	00:05:44	00:05:46	Yeah, what?
79	00:05:46	00:05:48	Yeah, heard the whole city's blacked-out.
80	00:05:48	00:05:50	What is that noise?
81	00:05:50	00:05:51	It's the sound of...
82	00:05:51	00:05:53	It's the sound of fear and futility.
83	00:05:53	00:05:56	Hey! You break that case, you own it.
84	00:05:56	00:05:58	This thing won't budge.
85	00:05:58	00:06:00	It's not an escape hatch if you can't escape.
86	00:06:00	00:06:01	Where are you?
87	00:06:01	00:06:03	We're trapped in elevator hell.
88	00:06:03	00:06:05	Who's we?
89	00:06:05	00:06:07	Me and-and... Henry.
90	00:06:09	00:06:16	I was on my way to the lab to process that metal trace that you and Finn found, and, uh, well, let's just say it's gonna to have to wait until help arrives.
91	00:06:16	00:06:18	I'll get Morgan call Maintenance.
92	00:06:18	00:06:23	Yeah, um, she might dial the phone a little faster if you omit the part about me being in here.
93	00:06:23	00:06:25	Just a thought.
94	00:06:25	00:06:27	What are you guys, in high school?
95	00:06:30	00:06:32	Hey. Hey.
96	00:06:32	00:06:40	So, we got blood splatter on the ceiling, spatter on the sheets, and we've got this white residue here.
97	00:06:40	00:06:41	Go ahead and bindle that.
98	00:06:41	00:06:45	Yeah. That's gonna be the easy part.
99	00:06:45	00:06:50	You know, if this turns out to be important evidence, who knows how long it's gonna take before we can process it and get an answer.
100	00:06:50	00:06:51	I know, I know, I know.
101	00:06:53	00:06:55	Okay...
102	00:06:55	00:06:59	no ladder outside the window, no tree that someone could climb up.
103	00:06:59	00:07:09	Dust along the ledges doesn't seem to be disturbed, so our... our kidnapper was already inside the house.
104	00:07:09	00:07:12	Hey, look at this void.
105	00:07:12	00:07:14	Blood pattern is interrupted right down this line.
106	00:07:16	00:07:18	What do you think, rug? Yeah.
107	00:07:18	00:07:21	Maybe somebody took the rug out of here with somebody inside of it.
108	00:07:21	00:07:26	And if this blood is the boy's, that means he put up a fight.
109	00:07:26	00:07:27	And lost.
110	00:07:30	00:07:35	And that would explain why there is no blood trailing out of the door or in the hallway or down the stairs.
111	00:07:35	00:07:38	Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, let's back up.
112	00:07:38	00:07:40	We don't know for sure that this is the boy's blood, right?
113	00:07:40	00:07:42	It could be the nanny's.
114	00:07:42	00:07:44	We can't run the DNA until the power's back on.
115	00:07:44	00:07:45	So what do we do?
116	00:07:47	00:07:49	We go old school.
117	00:07:49	00:07:51	ABO typing. I like that.
118	00:07:51	00:07:52	See, that's why you're here.
119	00:07:52	00:07:55	I'll call Greg.
120	00:07:55	00:07:56	Hey, Nick?
121	00:07:56	00:07:57	Yeah, I'm back here.
122	00:07:57	00:08:01	Checked all points of entry-- no sign of a break-in.
123	00:08:01	00:08:04	We could be looking at an inside job.
124	00:08:04	00:08:06	They look happy in this photo.
125	00:08:06	00:08:07	I wonder what happened to the wife.
126	00:08:11	00:08:13	This is some serious candle power.
127	00:08:13	00:08:15	I mean, it looks like T.C. Riordan is used to being unplugged.
128	00:08:19	00:08:21	Got blood drops on the table here.
129	00:08:24	00:08:25	And a couple more on the floor, see?
130	00:08:25	00:08:27	Mm-hmm.
131	00:08:27	00:08:30	You know, could be the same source as the blood upstairs.
132	00:08:30	00:08:32	The boy.
133	00:08:32	00:08:33	Yeah.
134	00:08:33	00:08:35	Spines suggest directionality.
135	00:08:37	00:08:39	Heading for the door outside.
136	00:08:39	00:08:41	Let's see where the trail goes.
137	00:08:41	00:08:45	How long has Shelby Buress been your son's nanny, Mr. Riordan?
138	00:08:45	00:08:46	From the minute Harper was born.
139	00:08:46	00:08:47	Shelby didn't do this.
140	00:08:47	00:08:49	You sound pretty sure of that.
141	00:08:49	00:08:50	I am.
142	00:08:50	00:08:52	This is a very big house.
143	00:08:52	00:08:54	You must have a lot of people working for you.
144	00:08:54	00:08:56	Yes. And I trust all of them.
145	00:08:56	00:08:58	I'm gonna need a list.
146	00:08:59	00:09:01	Do you and your wife share custody of your son?
147	00:09:01	00:09:06	My wife... my wife passed away five years ago.
148	00:09:06	00:09:07	I'm sorry.
149	00:09:07	00:09:12	And you said that you were asleep when Harper went missing.
150	00:09:12	00:09:13	I fell asleep in the den.
151	00:09:13	00:09:16	In a tux?
152	00:09:16	00:09:19	I was planning on going out tonight.
153	00:09:19	00:09:20	I changed my mind.
154	00:09:20	00:09:22	So what woke you up?
155	00:09:22	00:09:25	Nothing. Why?
156	00:09:25	00:09:26	You didn't hear anything?
157	00:09:26	00:09:29	No. I just...
158	00:09:29	00:09:31	I just woke up.
159	00:09:31	00:09:33	Well, we're gonna have to take your fingerprints.
160	00:09:33	00:09:35	It's just a standard procedure.
161	00:09:35	00:09:38	You know, so we can exclude yours from the kidnapper.
162	00:09:38	00:09:39	And we'll need a blood sample.
163	00:09:39	00:09:41	Fine.
164	00:09:41	00:09:43	One last question.
165	00:09:43	00:09:45	What is your son's blood type?
166	00:09:45	00:09:48	I don't know. No, it's fine.
167	00:09:48	00:09:51	Uh, did he cut himself, scrape himself recently?
168	00:09:51	00:09:53	Maybe a bloody nose?
169	00:09:53	00:09:56	He cut his chin just the other day.
170	00:09:56	00:09:58	The Band-Aid might still be in the garbage can.
171	00:09:58	00:10:01	And how did that happen, the cut on the chin?
172	00:10:01	00:10:03	He fell.
173	00:10:07	00:10:08	The Palermo?
174	00:10:08	00:10:10	Seriously?
175	00:10:10	00:10:12	Okay, when do you think engineers can be here?
176	00:10:12	00:10:15	Oh, okay, thanks.
177	00:10:15	00:10:16	For nothing.
178	00:10:16	00:10:18	Henry and Hodges still in the elevator?
179	00:10:18	00:10:19	Hodges is in there?
180	00:10:19	00:10:21	Just focus on Henry. And this.
181	00:10:21	00:10:22	What is it?
182	00:10:22	00:10:24	Residue from the missing boy's room.
183	00:10:24	00:10:26	Oh, Without the Mass Spec, what am I supposed to do with it?
184	00:10:26	00:10:28	I don't know. Be creative.
185	00:10:28	00:10:30	Russell has me doing ABO blood typing. Want to help?
186	00:10:30	00:10:33	Sure. Tonight, everything old is new.
187	00:12:01	00:12:02	I got clumping.
188	00:12:02	00:12:04	You? Yeah.
189	00:12:04	00:12:09	Based on the Band-Aid exemplar, the boy's blood type is O.
190	00:12:10	00:12:12	You sure about that?
191	00:12:12	00:12:15	Yeah.
192	00:12:15	00:12:16	Why?
193	00:12:16	00:12:19	What are you doing out here?
194	00:12:19	00:12:22	What, are you, uh, communing with the stars?
195	00:12:22	00:12:24	My cell phone's communing with a charger.
196	00:12:24	00:12:26	So what's your take on T.C. Riordan?
197	00:12:26	00:12:33	Why? What's yours? Wouldn't be the first time that a parent tried to cover up abuse with a phony kidnapping report.
198	00:12:33	00:12:36	Yeah, but let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.
199	00:12:36	00:12:38	Kidnapper hasn't contacted Riordan with any demands.
200	00:12:38	00:12:39	I know.
201	00:12:39	00:12:41	I just...
202	00:12:41	00:12:44	have a feeling this case is not going to follow the rules.
203	00:12:49	00:12:51	Blood trail's gone cold.
204	00:12:51	00:12:52	No drops since the house.
205	00:12:52	00:12:54	Rain probably washed them away.
206	00:12:59	00:13:00	Hey, Galileo.
207	00:13:00	00:13:01	Yeah.
208	00:13:01	00:13:03	00.
209	00:13:09	00:13:11	Saturn.
210	00:13:11	00:13:14	Planet from the boy's room.
211	00:13:17	00:13:19	Nick... and the missing carpet.
212	00:13:25	00:13:28	It's awfully convenient.
213	00:13:28	00:13:30	It's like we were meant to find him.
214	00:13:39	00:13:40	Whoa.
215	00:13:41	00:13:43	It's Harper's nanny.
216	00:13:46	00:13:48	Got a knife right here.
217	00:13:48	00:13:51	And something else.
218	00:13:58	00:14:00	We have Harper.
219	00:14:09	00:14:12	Till I can see what I'm doing, I'm going to have to hold off on the autopsy.
220	00:14:12	00:14:21	But my initial exam says the missing boy's nanny suffered two sharp force injuries to the chest and...
221	00:14:21	00:14:26	two more to the upper back, all from a double-edged blade.
222	00:14:26	00:14:30	That and the width of the wounds looks consistent with the knife that we found.
223	00:14:31	00:14:33	Things just keep getting better.
224	00:14:33	00:14:35	Someone ask for a light?
225	00:14:35	00:14:37	Yeah, a light.
226	00:14:37	00:14:39	That looks like a moonshine still.
227	00:14:39	00:14:43	Actually, it's a slightly different kind of white lightning.
228	00:14:43	00:14:44	Behold...
229	00:15:04	00:15:06	Not bad, huh?
230	00:15:06	00:15:12	In college, I found that R &amp; B, with just a little chemiluminescence, really set the mood.
231	00:15:12	00:15:14	I can see it. I can't.
232	00:15:14	00:15:15	What's in there anyway?
233	00:15:15	00:15:17	Luminol.
234	00:15:17	00:15:19	With just a splash of permanganate.
235	00:15:19	00:15:21	Great job, Dave.
236	00:15:21	00:15:22	It's nothing.
237	00:15:24	00:15:25	What do you got, Doc?
238	00:15:25	00:15:27	Could be an abrasion to the lip.
239	00:15:27	00:15:30	Doesn't look like blunt force trauma.
240	00:15:30	00:15:32	Pressure wound, maybe.
241	00:15:32	00:15:35	Kidnapper clamps a hand over her mouth to silence her.
242	00:15:42	00:15:44	The boy wouldn't have heard a thing.
243	00:15:44	00:15:46	Suggests a sequence.
244	00:15:46	00:15:47	Kill the nanny, take the boy.
245	00:15:47	00:15:49	And carry them both out of the room.
246	00:15:49	00:15:52	I think our kidnapper had help.
247	00:15:54	00:15:56	Whoa. Watch out. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
248	00:15:56	00:15:59	This thing's already killed someone.
249	00:15:59	00:16:01	Oh. You'd just be putting me out of my misery.
250	00:16:01	00:16:07	Why? What's wrong? That white residue from the kid's bedroom-- I was able to run all the standard color tests for an unknown white powder.
251	00:16:07	00:16:09	Got zip, zero, nada.
252	00:16:09	00:16:11	So it's a negative.
253	00:16:11	00:16:12	No, I should have gotten a result.
254	00:16:12	00:16:14	Color tests cover 90% of all narcotics.
255	00:16:14	00:16:15	Narcotics? Yeah.
256	00:16:15	00:16:17	Nanny murdered, kid grabbed up.
257	00:16:17	00:16:19	Dad says he didn't hear anything.
258	00:16:19	00:16:20	Kid could have been sedated, right?
259	00:16:20	00:16:23	Russell said use head and hands.
260	00:16:23	00:16:24	I'm using my head.
261	00:16:24	00:16:26	Hands not so good.
262	00:16:26	00:16:30	Okay, well, maybe I have another thought for your hands.
263	00:16:30	00:16:33	A crystal test-- it might cover the other ten percent.
264	00:16:33	00:16:36	Without electricity for the scopes?
265	00:16:42	00:16:44	Forget old school.
266	00:16:44	00:16:45	Go ancient.
267	00:16:49	00:16:52	How we doing on the metal trace from the boy's bedsheet?
268	00:16:52	00:16:55	Um, we are still trapped in the metal box.
269	00:16:55	00:16:57	You remember that, right?
270	00:16:57	00:16:58	Didn't Morgan make that call?
271	00:16:58	00:16:59	Yes.
272	00:16:59	00:17:06	And, uh, apparently, the people who could extricate us from our metal box are themselves stuck in a metal box in the Palermo.
273	00:17:06	00:17:07	I need that trace processed.
274	00:17:07	00:17:11	If our kidnapper brought it into that house, it may be our only way to find him.
275	00:17:11	00:17:15	So, if you can't get yourself out of there, find a way to get the evidence out.
276	00:17:15	00:17:16	How are we supposed to do that?
277	00:17:16	00:17:18	I don't know, Henry.
278	00:17:18	00:17:19	Figure something out.
279	00:17:21	00:17:23	Any more stupid questions?
280	00:17:23	00:17:26	Do you have to go to the bathroom as badly as I do?
281	00:18:03	00:18:04	Awesome.
282	00:18:06	00:18:08	Nice call on the crystal test.
283	00:18:08	00:18:12	White substance from the kid's bedroom screened positive for ketamine.
284	00:18:12	00:18:16	Used as a veterinary anesthetic, but also as an injectable pain med.
285	00:18:16	00:18:18	One Sara found...
286	00:18:18	00:18:20	in T.C. Riordan's medicine cabinet.
287	00:18:20	00:18:22	You were right-- the kid was doped.
288	00:18:22	00:18:24	What'd you find on the knife?
289	00:18:24	00:18:26	ABO results indicate two blood types.
290	00:18:26	00:18:30	Blood type on the blade is AB, which matches the nanny, Shelby Buress.
291	00:18:30	00:18:32	Fits with the rest of the evidence.
292	00:18:32	00:18:37	Blood on the handle is type O, which matches T.C. Riordan.
293	00:18:38	00:18:40	Location is everything.
294	00:18:40	00:18:43	Suggests the father was holding the knife.
295	00:18:43	00:18:47	So I called the police department in your old hometown, San Francisco.
296	00:18:47	00:18:50	We were really just checking on the nanny.
297	00:18:50	00:18:54	But it turns out you're the more interesting story.
298	00:18:54	00:19:01	When you told us that your wife passed away five years ago, you neglected to mention how.
299	00:19:01	00:19:03	Very suspicious drowning in your pool.
300	00:19:03	00:19:06	What does this have to do with finding my son?
301	00:19:06	00:19:11	Well, Frisco PD thinks you murdered your wife in a rage, and I think you did the same thing to the nanny.
302	00:19:11	00:19:15	And then you disposed of the only witness.
303	00:19:15	00:19:18	We're not going to find your son alive, are we?
304	00:19:18	00:19:19	This kidnapping crap...
305	00:19:21	00:19:22	...is just that. Right?
306	00:19:24	00:19:27	I'm going to tell you the same thing I told the cops in San Francisco.
307	00:19:27	00:19:29	I'm innocent.
308	00:19:29	00:19:31	And I'm telling the truth.
309	00:19:31	00:19:33	Yeah, but you're leaving out some important facts.
310	00:19:33	00:19:34	Like who Harper's real mother is.
311	00:19:34	00:19:38	Your nanny, Shelby Buress.
312	00:19:38	00:19:41	See, we, uh, confirmed that with the hospital in San Francisco.
313	00:19:41	00:19:43	She is Harper's birth mother.
314	00:19:43	00:19:45	I mean, it all adds up.
315	00:19:45	00:19:46	Your wife found out you knocked up Shelby.
316	00:19:46	00:19:49	She wants a divorce, she wants money, she ends up dead in your pool.
317	00:19:49	00:19:54	Flash-forward to your mistress, Shelby, who ends up dead in your backyard.
318	00:19:54	00:19:55	You got a way with women, buddy.
319	00:19:59	00:20:01	You ever see this knife before?
320	00:20:04	00:20:05	Yes. It's mine.
321	00:20:05	00:20:07	It's in my house.
322	00:20:07	00:20:09	How about it's in Shelby Buress's back?
323	00:20:09	00:20:15	See, we found her blood on the blade, but your blood on the handle.
324	00:20:15	00:20:17	How do you explain that?
325	00:20:17	00:20:18	That's my blood.
326	00:20:20	00:20:22	But I didn't murder anyone.
327	00:20:25	00:20:28	I was making an offering to the dead.
328	00:20:31	00:20:33	What?
329	00:20:33	00:20:35	I opened my vein during a séance.
330	00:20:37	00:20:39	You do know that you're not in San Francisco now.
331	00:20:39	00:20:41	The knife was part of the ritual.
332	00:20:41	00:20:43	For my departed Natalie.
333	00:20:44	00:20:47	I give you this gift from life unto death.
334	00:20:56	00:20:58	A séance?
335	00:21:00	00:21:01	Okay.
336	00:21:01	00:21:03	I'm all done here.
337	00:21:09	00:21:10	Okay.
338	00:21:10	00:21:12	Who else was at the séance?
339	00:21:12	00:21:17	Shelby, my mother-in-law Patricia, and Karen, the medium.
340	00:21:17	00:21:19	Well, how... how come we're just hearing about this now?
341	00:21:19	00:21:23	Because I knew you'd jump to the wrong conclusions, just like the cops in San Francisco did.
342	00:21:23	00:21:25	Well, it's a hell of a story, isn't it?
343	00:21:25	00:21:27	It's not a story; it's the truth.
344	00:21:28	00:21:29	I love my wife.
345	00:21:29	00:21:31	I miss her.
346	00:21:31	00:21:37	I brought together the people who were closest to her to try to... make contact.
347	00:21:38	00:21:39	And did you do that?
348	00:21:39	00:21:41	Did you make contact?
349	00:21:45	00:21:47	I'm not a murderer.
350	00:21:47	00:21:51	I'm a father who needs you to find my son.
351	00:22:06	00:22:09	Boy's been missing for over five hours now.
352	00:22:09	00:22:12	If he's really missing at all.
353	00:22:12	00:22:14	You know, Brass seems to think this whole thing is a hoax.
354	00:22:14	00:22:18	That the father killed the nanny and that the kid was just collateral damage.
355	00:22:18	00:22:21	Where are we at? Got a good fingerprint on the kidnapper's note here.
356	00:22:21	00:22:23	All right, that plus the headboard.
357	00:22:23	00:22:27	If they are T.C.'s prints, Brass's theory is looking pretty good.
358	00:22:27	00:22:28	Yeah.
359	00:22:28	00:22:31	Man, computers have really spoiled me.
360	00:22:31	00:22:32	It's been a while since I've done this by eye.
361	00:22:32	00:22:34	Uh-huh. Me, too.
362	00:22:34	00:22:36	All right, tell you what, you take the note.
363	00:22:36	00:22:38	I'll take the headboard.
364	00:22:38	00:22:40	Okay. There you go.
365	00:22:40	00:22:41	Thanks.
366	00:22:44	00:22:46	A plain arch.
367	00:22:46	00:22:49	No, wait a minute.
368	00:22:49	00:22:51	Got a tented arch here.
369	00:22:51	00:22:52	That's pretty cool.
370	00:22:52	00:22:56	I got the same thing here. That's very rare.
371	00:22:56	00:22:57	Good for us.
372	00:22:57	00:22:59	Maybe bad for T.C.
373	00:22:59	00:23:01	Let's check him out.
374	00:23:03	00:23:05	Ulnar loops, radial loops...
375	00:23:05	00:23:07	a few whorls.
376	00:23:07	00:23:08	Interesting ridge pattern.
377	00:23:11	00:23:13	It's a real smorgasbord, but...
378	00:23:13	00:23:14	No tented arches.
379	00:23:16	00:23:17	No.
380	00:23:17	00:23:22	The prints we found on the kidnapper's note and the boy's headboard did not belong to T.C.
381	00:23:22	00:23:23	And there were no prints on the knife.
382	00:23:23	00:23:26	So if the prints don't fit, you must acquit? Bull.
383	00:23:26	00:23:27	Yeah, I'm right there with you.
384	00:23:27	00:23:30	We've got Riordan's knife, his drugs.
385	00:23:30	00:23:34	I mean, I'm not saying that he necessarily did it alone, but we know he's got plenty of people working for him.
386	00:23:34	00:23:36	Yeah, and we checked them all out, though.
387	00:23:36	00:23:39	But he's got the money to buy their silence, maybe even their alibis.
388	00:23:39	00:23:40	Yeah, you were in the interrogation room.
389	00:23:40	00:23:44	Didn't you feel the presence of a con man, a lying sack of shinola? The whole séance story?
390	00:23:44	00:23:46	Yeah, it's far out. I know that.
391	00:23:46	00:23:51	I'm just saying, if the guy's telling the truth, there's a shot that his boy is still out there alive.
392	00:23:51	00:23:53	Were you able to follow up on his story?
393	00:23:53	00:23:58	Oh, you mean was I able to conjure up the mother-in-law and spirit guide? No, I'm still working on it.
394	00:23:58	00:24:00	We all know how this is gonna end.
395	00:24:02	00:24:06	Look, D.B.-- are you thinking like a dad here or a CSI?
396	00:24:06	00:24:09	Call just came in. Kidnapper.
397	00:24:11	00:24:13	Get yourself a pen and paper, Mr. Riordan.
398	00:24:13	00:24:15	Write this down.
399	00:24:20	00:24:22	I need to know...
400	00:24:22	00:24:24	is my son all right?
401	00:24:24	00:24:27	Who's asking, you or the cops?
402	00:24:29	00:24:32	Me. I'm asking.
403	00:24:32	00:24:33	Daddy?
404	00:24:33	00:24:34	Harper.
405	00:24:34	00:24:35	I'm scared.
406	00:24:35	00:24:37	Hey, pal...
407	00:24:38	00:24:42	Tell me something.
408	00:24:42	00:24:44	Who lives on the Moon?
409	00:24:44	00:24:47	The lady in white.
410	00:24:47	00:24:49	That's right.
411	00:24:49	00:24:51	Harper, are you okay?
412	00:24:51	00:24:53	Palermo parking lot, level three.
413	00:24:53	00:24:55	All the jewels from the safe.
414	00:24:55	00:24:56	00 a.m.
415	00:24:56	00:24:58	Your contact will wear a red hat. (line beeps off)
416	00:24:58	00:24:59	00 a.m.
417	00:24:59	00:25:00	That gives us four hours.
418	00:25:07	00:25:12	So you keep over $2 million worth of jewelry in your house safe?
419	00:25:12	00:25:13	Yes.
420	00:25:13	00:25:16	Most of it belonged to my wife Natalie.
421	00:25:16	00:25:19	You couldn't think of a better place to keep it?
422	00:25:19	00:25:20	I like to keep her things near.
423	00:25:23	00:25:26	There are some nights that...
424	00:25:26	00:25:28	Okay, um...
425	00:25:28	00:25:32	anyone else know about Natalie's jewelry?
426	00:25:32	00:25:33	My mother-in-law, Patricia.
427	00:25:34	00:25:36	Patricia Lydecker.
428	00:25:36	00:25:39	You were at the séance last night, is that right, Mrs. Lydecker?
429	00:25:39	00:25:40	Yes.
430	00:25:40	00:25:41	What time did you leave the house?
431	00:25:41	00:25:42	00.
432	00:25:42	00:25:44	Before they took Harper.
433	00:25:44	00:25:45	They?
434	00:25:45	00:25:50	Well, I just assume there must have been more than one person.
435	00:25:52	00:25:55	Okay. Um, and you were aware that T.C.
436	00:25:55	00:25:57	still had possession of your daughter's jewelry?
437	00:25:57	00:26:01	Yes. Why do you ask?
438	00:26:01	00:26:02	Just trying to, uh... get the facts straight.
439	00:26:02	00:26:13	And I'm also trying to understand how a woman whose son-in-law is suspected of murdering her daughter, how she could still be so cozy with the alleged killer.
440	00:26:13	00:26:23	See, we called the San Francisco police department, and they told us that after they dropped charges against T.C., you actually brought a wrongful death suit against him.
441	00:26:23	00:26:24	Which I withdrew.
442	00:26:24	00:26:26	Because you thought you might lose?
443	00:26:26	00:26:31	No, because I came to understand that my son-in-law is innocent.
444	00:26:31	00:26:34	Okay.
445	00:26:34	00:26:35	How'd that happen?
446	00:26:35	00:26:37	My daughter, Natalie, told me.
447	00:26:37	00:26:39	Natalie?
448	00:26:39	00:26:41	Through Karen.
449	00:26:41	00:26:47	Karen has helped me, helped me to find peace.
450	00:26:47	00:26:50	So you've communicated with Natalie?
451	00:26:50	00:26:51	Yes.
452	00:26:51	00:26:54	On several occasions at T.C.'s house.
453	00:26:54	00:26:59	Karen allows me to understand what it is that Natalie wants.
454	00:26:59	00:27:00	And what is that?
455	00:27:00	00:27:05	Mr. Russell, grief put my husband in an early grave.
456	00:27:05	00:27:08	Were it not for Karen, I might have joined him.
457	00:27:11	00:27:13	T.C. came to me in grief.
458	00:27:13	00:27:16	Said he was unable to accept the death of Natalie.
459	00:27:16	00:27:23	But peace comes not from the acceptance of death, but from an understanding that death is just the beginning.
460	00:27:25	00:27:28	I sense a disturbance in your chakras.
461	00:27:28	00:27:29	Yeah, I get that a lot.
462	00:27:29	00:27:33	What I want from you right now is a straight answer.
463	00:27:33	00:27:36	When did you leave the Riordan house?
464	00:27:36	00:27:37	00.
465	00:27:37	00:27:39	After the communion with Natalie.
466	00:27:39	00:27:41	Mrs. Lydecker and I shared a taxi.
467	00:27:41	00:27:43	And Mr. Riordan went to bed?
468	00:27:43	00:27:45	Oh, no. I doubt that.
469	00:27:45	00:27:49	What do you mean?
470	00:27:49	00:27:53	Look, if you know something, it's in your best interest to play medium with me right now.
471	00:27:55	00:27:58	During the ceremony, T.C. became agitated.
472	00:28:01	00:28:03	Natalie wants to speak.
473	00:28:03	00:28:04	What is it, my love?
474	00:28:09	00:28:13	My love, you have betrayed me again.
475	00:28:13	00:28:17	You must let me go for your sake, for the sake of Harper.
476	00:28:19	00:28:21	Your grief is not an act of love.
477	00:28:21	00:28:23	It's an act of selfishness.
478	00:28:28	00:28:29	My husband was upset.
479	00:28:29	00:28:31	He ended the communion.
480	00:28:31	00:28:32	Your husband?
481	00:28:32	00:28:36	I mean T.C. I'm sorry.
482	00:28:36	00:28:38	Natalie's spirit force is quite strong.
483	00:28:38	00:28:42	I feel her presence now.
484	00:28:42	00:28:43	Say hi for me.
485	00:28:43	00:28:46	Let's get back to T.C.
486	00:28:46	00:28:48	T.C told us all to leave.
487	00:28:48	00:28:50	He was angry.
488	00:28:50	00:28:51	The last I saw him, he was in the den.
489	00:28:51	00:28:54	When you say angry, how angry was he?
490	00:28:54	00:28:58	Natalie just wanted T.C. to find peace.
491	00:28:58	00:29:01	I'm afraid her words had the opposite effect.
492	00:29:04	00:29:08	Henry, I'm not sure your brute force is gonna get this evidence to the lab.
493	00:29:08	00:29:09	You're doing in wrong.
494	00:29:09	00:29:11	Really?
495	00:29:11	00:29:14	'Cause you took that elevator breakout class?
496	00:29:15	00:29:17	It's moving. Okay, yeah.
497	00:29:17	00:29:18	Come on.
498	00:29:18	00:29:19	Come on.
499	00:29:20	00:29:22	Aah! (groans)
500	00:29:23	00:29:24	(groans in pain) Damn.
501	00:29:27	00:29:29	What are you doing?
502	00:29:29	00:29:30	Calling Russell, admitting defeat.
503	00:29:30	00:29:31	What?! No.
504	00:29:31	00:29:32	Hey!
505	00:29:32	00:29:34	No more stupid questions, all right?
506	00:29:34	00:29:36	We are CSIs.
507	00:29:36	00:29:37	Well, sort of.
508	00:29:37	00:29:39	Let's come up with answers.
509	00:29:39	00:29:40	In here?
510	00:29:42	00:29:43	We have your kit.
511	00:29:46	00:29:48	You're right.
512	00:29:48	00:29:54	We could do a spot test, identify the material, then maybe it'll tell us where it came from.
513	00:29:54	00:29:56	I've got potassium hydroxide in my kit. Perfect.
514	00:30:01	00:30:02	Oh, wow.
515	00:30:02	00:30:04	That's all of it? It's enough to test.
516	00:30:04	00:30:06	Yeah, but the test consumes the whole thing.
517	00:30:06	00:30:08	If we're wrong, there's no do-overs.
518	00:30:08	00:30:11	If we're right, we may save a boy's life.
519	00:30:18	00:30:22	8 Red Hat is late.
520	00:30:22	00:30:24	I knew this was bogus.
521	00:30:24	00:30:25	I hope for the kid's sake you're wrong.
522	00:30:28	00:30:30	Look at this.
523	00:30:30	00:30:32	That bastard has been here the whole time.
524	00:30:40	00:30:41	What...
525	00:30:41	00:30:43	What's he doing? What's he doing now?
526	00:30:43	00:30:44	You think the boy's in there?
527	00:30:44	00:30:46	I don't like this.
528	00:30:46	00:30:47	Me, neither.
529	00:30:47	00:30:48	Hold on.
530	00:30:48	00:30:52	All units be advised, suspect is wearing a black leather jacket, red hat.
531	00:30:52	00:30:54	On the move.
532	00:30:54	00:30:56	Gray van. Do not engage, visuals only.
533	00:30:58	00:31:00	What happened to the rear window?
534	00:31:00	00:31:01	What window? There isn't any.
535	00:31:01	00:31:03	Exactly. Hey, where you going?
536	00:31:11	00:31:13	Somebody got out of that van.
537	00:31:13	00:31:14	Stop the van.
538	00:31:14	00:31:16	Lock down the parking structure.
539	00:31:20	00:31:22	Step out of the vehicle! Hands on your head!
540	00:31:24	00:31:26	Step away from the van.
541	00:31:28	00:31:29	Put you hands where I can see 'em!
542	00:31:39	00:31:42	Van's clear.
543	00:31:42	00:31:43	Where's the guy?
544	00:31:43	00:31:44	I don't know.
545	00:31:44	00:31:45	He told me to drive to an address.
546	00:31:45	00:31:47	He said I'd find Harper there.
547	00:31:47	00:31:49	He said no cops, no surprises.
548	00:31:49	00:31:51	You people just got my son killed.
549	00:31:53	00:31:56	434, shots fired at the corner of Altos and Fairway.
550	00:31:56	00:31:58	Units responding.
551	00:32:13	00:32:15	Same jacket, same face.
552	00:32:15	00:32:17	It's Red Hat.
553	00:32:17	00:32:19	Must have had an accomplice-- put two bullets in him.
554	00:32:19	00:32:20	No Harper.
555	00:32:24	00:32:27	Looks like somebody forgot to get paid.
556	00:32:27	00:32:28	Not good for the kid.
557	00:32:32	00:32:35	Address the kidnapper gave Riordan was bogus.
558	00:32:35	00:32:37	Empty lot; no Harper.
559	00:32:37	00:32:38	Red Hat's name is Trevor Raymond.
560	00:32:38	00:32:42	He's got a Henderson address, and he's got a nice set of tented arches.
561	00:32:42	00:32:44	His prints are the ones that we found on headboard and the note.
562	00:32:44	00:32:48	Which puts him inside the house as well as outside, dumping the nanny's body.
563	00:32:48	00:32:51	Two bullets in Raymond confirms our theory that he wasn't working alone.
564	00:32:51	00:32:55	Yeah, and Trevor Raymond wasn't on T.C.'s list of employees or staff.
565	00:32:55	00:32:58	Okay, so if this is an inside job, who's our insider?
566	00:32:58	00:33:00	Nick and Brass are searching Raymond's place now.
567	00:33:00	00:33:02	Hopefully they'll find a link to the accomplice.
568	00:33:02	00:33:03	Forget the three-hour rule.
569	00:33:03	00:33:05	We're into hour nine now.
570	00:33:05	00:33:09	Yeah, but... No, I'm saying, look, we've got a dead nanny, now we've got a dead kidnapper.
571	00:33:09	00:33:13	And the fact that the accomplice panicked and left the loot behind, the kid's got to be dead, too.
572	00:33:13	00:33:17	How's that help us right now?
573	00:33:17	00:33:19	Well, actually, the guy didn't leave all the loot behind.
574	00:33:19	00:33:21	Morgan's got the last iPad standing.
575	00:33:21	00:33:23	Still has some juice.
576	00:33:23	00:33:27	I was able to pull up the inventory photos of the jewelry that we took before we made the exchange with Red Hat.
577	00:33:27	00:33:29	There is something missing.
578	00:33:29	00:33:30	Let's take a look.
579	00:33:36	00:33:38	Oh, yeah. Wedding ring.
580	00:33:38	00:33:40	Well, from the size of it, I'm guessing it's Natalie's.
581	00:33:40	00:33:44	I'm guessing that the ring isn't the only thing that belonged to Natalie.
582	00:33:44	00:33:45	Why? What do you got?
583	00:33:45	00:33:50	I was adding Trevor Raymond's blood type to our ABO findings, when I noticed something.
584	00:33:50	00:33:53	Harper Riordan's blood type is O.
585	00:33:53	00:33:54	Yeah.
586	00:33:54	00:33:55	Check out Shelby Buress's.
587	00:33:58	00:33:59	AB.
588	00:34:01	00:34:03	Let's get a few things straight, Mr. Riordan.
589	00:34:03	00:34:08	First, your son Harper is really your wife Natalie's son, isn't he?
590	00:34:08	00:34:11	Shelby Buress's blood type is not compatible with Harper.
591	00:34:11	00:34:14	She may have given birth to him, but she was not his mother.
592	00:34:14	00:34:16	She was a surrogate.
593	00:34:16	00:34:18	So there wasn't an affair, was there?
594	00:34:18	00:34:23	For five years, the world's thought I'm a murderer and a philanderer.
595	00:34:23	00:34:28	What happened between me, my wife and Shelby and my family-- that's my business and no one else's.
596	00:34:28	00:34:29	What do you mean, what does it matter?
597	00:34:31	00:34:35	$2 million worth of jewelry, and the kidnapper takes this.
598	00:34:35	00:34:36	A simple wedding band.
599	00:34:36	00:34:37	Your wife's ring.
600	00:34:37	00:34:39	Why? I don't know.
601	00:34:39	00:34:41	No, you have to know.
602	00:34:41	00:34:43	Look, T.C., you have a choice here.
603	00:34:43	00:34:50	You can either stay shuttered up in your house with your ghosts, feeling sorry for yourself or you can open the damn blinds.
604	00:34:50	00:34:52	This ring is important.
605	00:34:52	00:34:55	It's important to you and to the person who took your son.
606	00:34:55	00:34:58	Now, come on.
607	00:34:58	00:35:00	That ring is the reason why Natalie's dead.
608	00:35:01	00:35:03	We'd been at a party.
609	00:35:04	00:35:05	We were both drunk.
610	00:35:06	00:35:09	We had a fight.
611	00:35:09	00:35:12	Natalie took off her ring and she threw it in the pool.
612	00:35:12	00:35:13	Go. Go! Yes!
613	00:35:17	00:35:19	Few hours later, we made up.
614	00:35:19	00:35:24	She went to get the ring back and...
615	00:35:24	00:35:25	she was still drunk.
616	00:35:27	00:35:30	I didn't even hear her.
617	00:35:33	00:35:36	It was an accident.
618	00:35:36	00:35:38	But the world blamed you.
619	00:35:38	00:35:40	The world was right.
620	00:35:40	00:35:42	It was my fault.
621	00:35:42	00:35:43	W-What are you gonna do?
622	00:35:43	00:35:48	You gonna make your son pay for your sins?
623	00:35:48	00:35:52	You think someone took Harper to punish me?
624	00:35:56	00:35:58	Natalie's mother Patricia.
625	00:35:58	00:36:01	Yeah, but she claims that she's forgiven T.C., so...
626	00:36:01	00:36:02	(scoffs) That's ridiculous.
627	00:36:02	00:36:05	I would never forgive somebody who killed my daughter.
628	00:36:05	00:36:08	Yeah, but we know your history with forgiveness, so that... Oh, that's nice.
629	00:36:08	00:36:11	No, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it that way.
630	00:36:11	00:36:13	Come on, now, stop it, focus. Patricia.
631	00:36:13	00:36:16	Okay, she was there that night.
632	00:36:16	00:36:17	She was in the house.
633	00:36:17	00:36:19	She knew about the jewelry.
634	00:36:19	00:36:20	And maybe she knew about Harper.
635	00:36:20	00:36:24	He was her daughter's son, therefore her grandson.
636	00:36:24	00:36:28	Who should be living with her and not her daughter's murderer.
637	00:36:28	00:36:29	Yes, it's a twofer.
638	00:36:29	00:36:31	Get the boy, kill the nanny.
639	00:36:31	00:36:34	And with T.C.'s history, he becomes the obvious suspect.
640	00:36:34	00:36:36	And maybe this time he goes down for the crime.
641	00:36:36	00:36:37	Hey.
642	00:36:37	00:36:39	What do you got?
643	00:36:39	00:36:41	Brass and I tossed Red Hat's place pretty thoroughly.
644	00:36:41	00:36:43	Somebody sent him ten G's.
645	00:36:43	00:36:44	We found a receipt for the wire transfer.
646	00:36:44	00:36:46	So we got our accomplice.
647	00:36:46	00:36:48	Depends if you believe in ghosts or not.
648	00:36:48	00:36:49	Check out the signature.
649	00:36:49	00:36:51	Signed by the late Natalie Riordan.
650	00:36:55	00:36:57	Okay, that's freaky.
651	00:36:59	00:37:01	Yes.
652	00:37:06	00:37:09	CSIs. CSIs.
653	00:37:09	00:37:11	Well, sort of.
654	00:37:11	00:37:12	So?
655	00:37:12	00:37:13	Got it.
656	00:37:18	00:37:21	Hodges and Henry were able to I.D. that metal trace.
657	00:37:21	00:37:26	It's a specific composite of magnesium used primarily in the production of mag wheels.
658	00:37:26	00:37:29	Where do you find a mag wheel factory in Las Vegas?
659	00:37:29	00:37:38	Well, there's only one, and luckily for us, it's across the street from the wire transfer office where the ghost of Natalie Riordan sent money to Trevor Raymond.
660	00:37:38	00:37:39	Northeast Las Vegas.
661	00:37:39	00:37:42	A lot of abandoned buildings and homes in that part of town.
662	00:37:42	00:37:45	If I was looking for a kidnapper's lair, that's where I'd go.
663	00:37:45	00:37:47	Boy, that's a lot of territory to cover.
664	00:37:47	00:37:49	Maybe I can help narrow down the canvass.
665	00:37:49	00:37:51	What do you got?
666	00:37:51	00:37:52	A line on our ghost.
667	00:37:52	00:37:55	She used a fake I.D. to make the wire transfer.
668	00:37:56	00:37:59	Karen Chavera.
669	00:38:03	00:38:05	Our ghost is the ghost whisperer.
670	00:38:07	00:38:08	Karen Chavera!
671	00:38:09	00:38:11	LVPD!
672	00:38:12	00:38:14	Guess we know how Karen met Trevor.
673	00:38:16	00:38:18	Clear. No lady, no kid.
674	00:38:18	00:38:20	Same here. But you gotta see this.
675	00:38:29	00:38:32	Whoa.
676	00:38:32	00:38:35	That is some crazy wallpaper.
677	00:38:35	00:38:36	It's a shrine to T.C. and Natalie.
678	00:38:38	00:38:42	Looks like our medium's research turned into a bit of an obsession, don't you think?
679	00:38:47	00:38:50	Yeah. She helped herself to Natalie's things.
680	00:38:52	00:38:54	And to T.C.'s meds.
681	00:38:57	00:39:00	Dear T.C., By the time you read this, Harper and I will be gone.
682	00:39:00	00:39:07	I thought we could be together, but again you rejected me, gave your love away to Shelby, even Karen, who reunited us.
683	00:39:07	00:39:09	You left me no choice but to take them away from you.
684	00:39:09	00:39:11	Now, you feel my pain.
685	00:39:11	00:39:14	It's signed Natalie.
686	00:39:14	00:39:17	I think that she became Natalie Riordan.
687	00:39:17	00:39:21	Problem is, Karen thought T.C. had an affair with Shelby.
688	00:39:21	00:39:27	So when Karen became Natalie, she took revenge on the one woman she blamed for stealing T.C. away.
689	00:39:31	00:39:32	And then she took her kid.
690	00:39:52	00:39:54	That hutch is blocking a door.
691	00:39:54	00:39:56	Let's move it.
692	00:40:04	00:40:05	There he is. Hey, bud.
693	00:40:05	00:40:07	Harper.
694	00:40:07	00:40:09	It's okay. It's all right, all right?
695	00:40:09	00:40:11	We're with the police. Everything's going to be okay.
696	00:40:11	00:40:12	Russell, it's Stokes.
697	00:40:12	00:40:14	We found Harper, alive and well.
698	00:40:14	00:40:16	No sign of Karen, though.
699	00:40:16	00:40:17	Yeah, I know.
700	00:40:17	00:40:20	I've got eyes on her right now.
701	00:40:20	00:40:24	I guess she felt she had to... join Natalie.
702	00:40:32	00:40:33	Let's bring the boy on home.
703	00:40:45	00:40:47	It's good to have all the IS'es back, isn't it?
704	00:40:47	00:40:50	It's good to have everything back.
705	00:40:59	00:41:01	You, uh, sure about that?
706	00:41:01	00:41:05	You never know when it might come in handy.
707	00:41:05	00:41:06	Hmm.
708	00:41:06	00:41:08	Why go old school...
709	00:41:08	00:41:10	When you can go ancient.
710	00:41:11	00:41:13	Hmm.
711	00:41:43	00:41:45	No three-hour rule on this one.
