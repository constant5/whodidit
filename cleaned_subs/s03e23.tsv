0	00:00:34	00:00:36	Jimmy, stop staring.
1	00:00:36	00:00:37	It's okay, ma'am.
2	00:00:58	00:01:00	Up against the glass, now!
3	00:01:00	00:01:01	Come on. Let's go. Move it!
4	00:01:01	00:01:04	Move it! Come on. Let's go!
5	00:01:09	00:01:11	Let's go. Let's go! Up there!
6	00:01:11	00:01:13	Get near the glass. Don't move!
7	00:01:16	00:01:17	One peep, and you die.
8	00:01:17	00:01:19	The boy, too.
9	00:01:20	00:01:22	Hands on the wall, now!
10	00:01:22	00:01:24	Move it!
11	00:01:29	00:01:33	Open it! Open it!
12	00:01:36	00:01:38	Open it!
13	00:01:58	00:02:00	I have to get out of here!
14	00:02:01	00:02:03	Any one of you moves a muscle, I'll blow you away.
15	00:02:03	00:02:04	Oh, my God!
16	00:02:46	00:02:47	Got it! Go!
17	00:02:47	00:02:48	Go!
18	00:02:50	00:02:51	Let's go!
19	00:03:36	00:03:39	What a day to come back to work.
20	00:03:40	00:03:42	Coming?
21	00:03:52	00:03:53	This crew was in and out.
22	00:03:53	00:03:56	Three, maybe four guys, depending on who you talk to.
23	00:03:56	00:04:01	Detective Lockwood drew his weapon protecting a woman and a child.
24	00:04:04	00:04:06	Wrong place, wrong time.
25	00:04:06	00:04:09	There is no right time to kill a cop.
26	00:04:11	00:04:14	I only see one bullet wound through the back.
27	00:04:14	00:04:18	Yeah, witnesses say that he was, uh, taken down with a single shot.
28	00:04:30	00:04:32	Beveled edges on the inside.
29	00:04:32	00:04:34	The shot came from outside.
30	00:04:35	00:04:37	We need to get a picture of this.
31	00:04:37	00:04:39	These guys were pros.
32	00:04:39	00:04:41	How much did they get?
33	00:04:42	00:04:45	According to the tellers, they weren't interested in money.
34	00:04:45	00:04:48	What were they interested in?
35	00:05:04	00:05:05	See the blast marks?
36	00:05:05	00:05:08	Charges were placed in corner quadrants.
37	00:05:08	00:05:13	Four boxes up, five across.
38	00:05:13	00:05:16	The rest looks like collateral damage.
39	00:05:16	00:05:19	Whoever did this knew precisely what they were after.
40	00:05:19	00:05:22	Well, the one good thing about their precision...
41	00:05:22	00:05:24	it'll narrow our focus.
42	00:05:27	00:05:31	and Volkswagen. On the road of life there are passengers and there are drivers.
43	00:06:01	00:06:03	I heard officer down.
44	00:06:03	00:06:04	I didn't know it was Lockwood.
45	00:06:04	00:06:06	Wonder what he was doing here.
46	00:06:06	00:06:07	He's supposed to be off duty.
47	00:06:08	00:06:09	He was only 34 years old.
48	00:06:09	00:06:12	All right, good. All here.
49	00:06:12	00:06:14	We've got a lot of work to do.
50	00:06:14	00:06:16	Grissom...
51	00:06:16	00:06:18	Grissom?
52	00:06:19	00:06:21	Sorry.
53	00:06:21	00:06:23	I was thinking.
54	00:06:23	00:06:27	Well, I was thinking that we need to start processing this bank.
55	00:06:27	00:06:29	Right.
56	00:06:29	00:06:31	I'll take the safety deposit boxes.
57	00:06:31	00:06:33	Sara, you're with me.
58	00:06:34	00:06:37	Radio car's shot up pretty good.
59	00:06:37	00:06:39	I'll dig around in there.
60	00:06:39	00:06:41	Take the cameras.
61	00:06:45	00:06:48	They made sure we didn't have eyes.
62	00:06:48	00:06:50	Check the tape anyway.
63	00:06:50	00:06:51	I think we found the getaway vehicle.
64	00:06:51	00:06:52	Where?
65	00:06:52	00:06:54	Block from the off-ramp.
66	00:06:54	00:06:55	Coroner's en route.
67	00:06:55	00:06:56	The coroner?
68	00:06:56	00:06:58	The driver's dead.
69	00:07:07	00:07:09	Electric blasting cap.
70	00:07:09	00:07:12	Brown leg wires feeding into the grommet.
71	00:07:12	00:07:13	Means they could've used C4.
72	00:07:15	00:07:19	Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.
73	00:07:24	00:07:26	Four corners.
74	00:07:26	00:07:28	What does that tell us?
75	00:07:29	00:07:31	Whatever they were looking for was definitely in the center.
76	00:07:32	00:07:35	all force generated towards one central area.
77	00:07:35	00:07:38	How are we ever going to find out what's missing?
78	00:07:42	00:07:44	I just found the detonator.
79	00:07:45	00:07:47	I'll get it fumed.
80	00:07:47	00:07:49	What have you got?
81	00:07:50	00:07:53	Radio car traveled about 15 feet after being hit.
82	00:07:53	00:07:56	I followed the leakage back to its original position.
83	00:07:56	00:08:00	Two in the hood, one in the windshield, Lockwood.
84	00:08:01	00:08:04	High power, long range.
85	00:08:04	00:08:07	I'll take any part of that bullet.
86	00:08:18	00:08:20	Oh, God.
87	00:08:20	00:08:23	Near decapitation.
88	00:08:23	00:08:25	Wire's still around his neck.
89	00:08:25	00:08:28	The driver became a liability after the heist.
90	00:08:28	00:08:31	No honor among thieves, I guess.
91	00:08:31	00:08:33	Tells us something about them.
92	00:08:33	00:08:35	Hey, why are we stopping here?
93	00:08:37	00:08:39	Your job is finished.
94	00:09:48	00:09:52	Lockwood was a good cop.
95	00:09:52	00:09:53	It's too bad.
96	00:09:56	00:09:58	Grissom, I just talked to Hodges.
97	00:09:58	00:10:00	That black substance from the camera lens?
98	00:10:00	00:10:06	The FTIR spit back magnesium aluminum, silicate, talc, methylparaben, and sunscreen.
99	00:10:06	00:10:10	All of these chemicals are consistent with camouflage cream.
100	00:10:12	00:10:13	Blackface paint.
101	00:10:15	00:10:21	My guess is the same stick they used to cover up that camera lens, they used to paint their faces with.
102	00:10:21	00:10:23	I just found an eyelash in it.
103	00:10:26	00:10:27	Gil.
104	00:10:28	00:10:29	Just coming to see you.
105	00:10:30	00:10:33	I pulled the bullet from Cyrus Lockwood.
106	00:10:33	00:10:36	Fully intact, well preserved.
107	00:10:36	00:10:37	Well, you didn't have to bring this over.
108	00:10:37	00:10:38	We could've picked it up.
109	00:10:38	00:10:39	I wanted to.
110	00:10:39	00:10:45	Every day I see people I don't know, but I saw a lot of Lockwood, and I did get to know him.
111	00:10:45	00:10:47	I felt like I owed it to him.
112	00:10:47	00:10:49	Thanks, Doctor.
113	00:10:53	00:10:53	We got a bullet.
114	00:10:54	00:10:55	We got prints.
115	00:10:55	00:10:56	Getaway driver.
116	00:10:56	00:10:57	Larry Whiting.
117	00:10:58	00:11:04	29. He was convicted of assault and drunk and disorderly five years ago.
118	00:11:04	00:11:05	Did some time.
119	00:11:07	00:11:09	valet at the Rampart.
120	00:11:09	00:11:12	Isn't that one of Sam Braun's hotels?
121	00:11:12	00:11:13	Mm-hmm.
122	00:11:13	00:11:16	You have to have a non-gaming work card to park cars at a Vegas casino.
123	00:11:16	00:11:19	How does a guy with a criminal record get one?
124	00:11:19	00:11:20	He doesn't.
125	00:11:20	00:11:23	Unless he was juiced in by Sam Braun.
126	00:11:23	00:11:27	Well, it is his hotel. It's his call, ultimately.
127	00:11:27	00:11:28	Yeah?
128	00:11:28	00:11:30	Well, it's our case, so it's our call.
129	00:11:30	00:11:31	Mmm. Check it out.
130	00:11:32	00:11:34	I may be compromised.
131	00:11:34	00:11:37	You know I have a personal relationship with the guy.
132	00:11:37	00:11:39	You'll be fine.
133	00:12:06	00:12:08	I'm going to have to talk to H.R.
134	00:12:08	00:12:09	about this Larry Whiting.
135	00:12:10	00:12:14	Human Resources is never supposed to process anyone with a record.
136	00:12:14	00:12:16	Well, his record caught up with him, Sam.
137	00:12:16	00:12:21	We suspect he was involved in the First Monument Bank robbery.
138	00:12:21	00:12:24	Getaway driver... except everyone got away but him.
139	00:12:24	00:12:27	I have to tell you, Mugs, name doesn't ring a bell.
140	00:12:29	00:12:30	Sam...
141	00:12:31	00:12:38	That's like you telling me when I was a kid that you were too tired to drive home every night when you were sleeping with my mother.
142	00:12:38	00:12:42	Well, you can't fault a fellow for wanting to be with his two best girls.
143	00:12:42	00:12:45	All right.
144	00:12:47	00:12:49	Where is all of this leading?
145	00:12:50	00:12:55	Well, last year, one of your cocktail waitresses is murdered.
146	00:12:55	00:12:57	Still unsolved.
147	00:12:59	00:13:02	She worked at another one of my hotels-- the Whiskey Town.
148	00:13:02	00:13:05	And this Whiting guy worked here at the Rampart...
149	00:13:05	00:13:06	They're both your hotels....
150	00:13:06	00:13:08	How does that look for business?
151	00:13:08	00:13:12	Mugs, I got a P.R. department that deals with that.
152	00:13:12	00:13:23	When one white tiger killed another one in the Secret Garden at the Mirage, the P.R. Department had it buried on page 16E, under the car ads, about...
153	00:13:23	00:13:24	this big.
154	00:13:24	00:13:27	Right. They made it go away.
155	00:13:27	00:13:30	Some things are people's business.
156	00:13:30	00:13:32	Some things aren't.
157	00:13:32	00:13:34	Well, this is my business.
158	00:13:34	00:13:36	It's not going to go away.
159	00:13:38	00:13:40	Then I'll be rooting for you.
160	00:13:48	00:13:49	Las Vegas Police.
161	00:13:50	00:13:53	Manager said he lived alone.
162	00:14:03	00:14:09	If this getaway driver's stupid enough to get whacked by his partners, he's stupid enough to leave something behind.
163	00:14:12	00:14:15	This whole neighborhood's stupid.
164	00:14:21	00:14:22	Whew.
165	00:14:24	00:14:27	Whew.
166	00:14:27	00:14:30	Sixty grand a year for jockeying cars?
167	00:14:30	00:14:31	I'm in the wrong line of work.
168	00:14:32	00:14:34	you're still alive.
169	00:14:35	00:14:38	Bedroom's a bust. What do you got?
170	00:14:43	00:14:46	I got two $5,000 stacks from the Rampart.
171	00:14:46	00:14:48	Sam Braun's hotel.
172	00:14:50	00:14:54	Um, Lockwood's bullet on the right, and the cop car bullet...
173	00:14:54	00:14:57	what's left of that cop car bullet's on the left.
174	00:14:57	00:15:00	Both projectiles with 308s.
175	00:15:00	00:15:02	Consistent with the M1A.
176	00:15:02	00:15:03	Long gun. Mm-hmm.
177	00:15:03	00:15:08	And long guns are only registered to the person who makes the initial purchase...
178	00:15:08	00:15:10	and the serial numbers aren't recorded.
179	00:15:12	00:15:15	Impossible to trace, so it's a dead end.
180	00:15:15	00:15:18	Well, forensically, yeah, but not cognitively.
181	00:15:18	00:15:24	See, shooting someone from long range, and taking out the engine of a radio car while it is hauling ass...
182	00:15:24	00:15:26	You're looking at one sharp shooter.
183	00:15:26	00:15:29	And that kind of training only comes from...
184	00:15:29	00:15:30	The military.
185	00:15:34	00:15:36	Thank you!
186	00:18:30	00:18:32	Wow.
187	00:18:32	00:18:33	Almost looks good as new.
188	00:18:33	00:18:36	Kind of.
189	00:18:36	00:18:39	This was the epitome of precision.
190	00:18:40	00:18:48	The outer rim of boxes sustained the most damage The intent was not to blow out the 23 surrounding boxes, but to preserve the sanctity of the center box.
191	00:18:49	00:18:50	Box 729? It's history.
192	00:18:50	00:18:52	It's the only thing that's gone.
193	00:18:52	00:18:54	That's the box they were after.
194	00:18:55	00:18:58	And we still don't know what was inside.
195	00:19:07	00:19:09	What is up with the bank manager?
196	00:19:09	00:19:10	We've been waiting forever.
197	00:19:16	00:19:18	Hey.
198	00:19:18	00:19:21	How long have we known each other?
199	00:19:21	00:19:24	In days, months, or years?
200	00:19:24	00:19:26	I'm serious here.
201	00:19:28	00:19:30	Can you hear me?
202	00:19:30	00:19:31	Sorry I'm late.
203	00:19:34	00:19:37	Been on the phone all night with corporate...
204	00:19:37	00:19:40	not to mention I had a gun in my face.
205	00:19:40	00:19:44	So, you want to know the lessees of some of our safe deposit boxes?
206	00:19:44	00:19:45	Oh, not some, just one.
207	00:19:45	00:19:47	Box 729.
208	00:19:47	00:19:49	Why don't you just hold up a touch?
209	00:19:49	00:19:50	I want to help you, but...
210	00:19:50	00:19:52	you're going to have to give me a court order.
211	00:19:52	00:19:55	Oh, no worries.
212	00:20:10	00:20:13	Box 729 lessee is Benny Murdock.
213	00:20:13	00:20:14	Benny Murdock?
214	00:20:17	00:20:18	You know him?
215	00:20:18	00:20:21	Yeah.
216	00:20:21	00:20:24	Benny.
217	00:20:24	00:20:26	He was my first doorman at the Whiskey Town.
218	00:20:26	00:20:30	A year later, I made him a casino host at Pike's Gambling Hall.
219	00:20:30	00:20:35	Within six months, he had all the play at the Tangiers.
220	00:20:35	00:20:37	Six months.
221	00:20:39	00:20:41	Became my right arm when we opened the Rampart.
222	00:20:41	00:20:43	I never thought I would outlive him.
223	00:20:44	00:20:46	He died a couple of weeks ago, right?
224	00:20:46	00:20:49	Brain aneurysm.
225	00:20:49	00:20:51	You never know when you're going to go.
226	00:20:51	00:20:53	All those memories...
227	00:20:53	00:20:56	Benny, we're going to have a great summer.
228	00:20:59	00:21:03	Did Larry Whiting... know Benny?
229	00:21:03	00:21:07	Everybody who was anybody knew Benny, including you.
230	00:21:08	00:21:10	Informally.
231	00:21:10	00:21:14	Informally enough for him to direct the high-end whales your way when you were dancing.
232	00:21:14	00:21:15	Ooh...
233	00:21:15	00:21:18	That is old Vegas, Sam.
234	00:21:19	00:21:21	Sunset on that time.
235	00:21:24	00:21:28	I hear you and Benny had a little sunset of your own.
236	00:21:29	00:21:31	A falling out about six months ago.
237	00:21:31	00:21:35	Mr. Braun, it's Bravado regarding BJ 19.
238	00:21:35	00:21:40	If you will excuse me, I have to take care of that.
239	00:21:46	00:21:47	Yeah?
240	00:21:47	00:21:50	Raise the limit, and change the cards.
241	00:21:50	00:21:53	If he wins three double downs in a row, call me back.
242	00:21:53	00:21:55	We'll send Mr. Happy.
243	00:21:59	00:22:01	I'm sorry. Where were we?
244	00:22:01	00:22:03	Benny.
245	00:22:03	00:22:04	Sorry. That's off limits...
246	00:22:04	00:22:07	but I was with him in the hospital when he died.
247	00:22:07	00:22:09	We made our peace, if it's for the record.
248	00:22:09	00:22:14	You wouldn't happen to know what he kept inside his safe deposit box, would you?
249	00:22:14	00:22:16	You'll have to ask him.
250	00:22:16	00:22:17	Well, I wish we could.
251	00:22:17	00:22:21	If you'll excuse me, someone is robbing me downstairs.
252	00:22:28	00:22:32	You know what off the record means, don't you, Greg?
253	00:22:32	00:22:34	Yeah.
254	00:22:40	00:22:43	Albert, got a minute?
255	00:22:43	00:22:44	Sure. What's up?
256	00:22:44	00:22:48	I'd like a second opinion.
257	00:22:49	00:22:51	Boy, I wish you'd come to me sooner.
258	00:22:51	00:22:53	Your condition's pretty far along.
259	00:22:54	00:22:55	Why did you wait?
260	00:22:57	00:22:58	I hoped it would go away.
261	00:22:58	00:23:01	Doesn't your mother have this condition?
262	00:23:01	00:23:04	Yeah. It's hereditary.
263	00:23:04	00:23:05	I know.
264	00:23:06	00:23:08	I wasn't rational.
265	00:23:09	00:23:11	Look, Gil, I'm not going to preach to you.
266	00:23:11	00:23:13	You came to me, but... doctor to doctor...
267	00:23:14	00:23:21	there's a chance the bone deposits have spread into the inner ear, in which case, your hearing loss will eventually be permanent.
268	00:23:22	00:23:26	If I were you, I'd schedule surgery as soon as possible.
269	00:23:28	00:23:35	You know the eyelash Warrick found embedded in the black greasepaint-- I extracted the DNA, ran it.
270	00:23:35	00:23:39	CODIS gave me a, uh, Mongolian beef.
271	00:23:39	00:23:40	I'm sorry. What does that mean?
272	00:23:40	00:23:42	That means he got nothing.
273	00:23:42	00:23:43	There, try these, big guy.
274	00:23:43	00:23:44	Training wheels.
275	00:23:44	00:23:45	Thanks.
276	00:23:45	00:23:48	Hey, guys, guys, let's focus on the robbers.
277	00:23:48	00:23:49	Grissom?
278	00:23:50	00:23:51	What do you think?
279	00:23:51	00:23:54	I think we're giving these guys too much credit.
280	00:23:54	00:23:58	They're experts at robbing banks, not experts at concealing evidence.
281	00:23:58	00:24:03	Well, unless the answer's in that fortune cookie, what's the plan?
282	00:24:03	00:24:06	Do you ever wonder how the fortune gets inside the cookie?
283	00:24:06	00:24:07	I know.
284	00:24:07	00:24:09	Of course you do.
285	00:24:09	00:24:19	The cookie comes out of a press, like a tortilla, and then some lady puts the fortune in the center of the dough, and then folds the dough around a piece of metal, and then folds it again.
286	00:24:20	00:24:21	That's the answer.
287	00:25:05	00:25:06	Robert Rubio.
288	00:25:06	00:25:08	Work card. Non-gaming.
289	00:25:08	00:25:10	He's in the hotel business.
290	00:25:10	00:25:11	Rampart.
291	00:25:11	00:25:13	Hey, didn't that other guy work at the...
292	00:25:13	00:25:14	Run him through the military database.
293	00:25:14	00:25:16	Why? Just run it.
294	00:25:17	00:25:20	After that, give us an address.
295	00:25:35	00:25:37	All clear.
296	00:25:37	00:25:38	It's all yours, boss.
297	00:25:44	00:25:45	Come on. Let's see what's cooking.
298	00:25:48	00:25:50	Whoo!
299	00:25:51	00:25:56	Oh, well, that is... one example of the evidence going up in smoke.
300	00:25:56	00:25:58	This guy's a piece of work, huh?
301	00:26:07	00:26:11	One of the black coats, you think?
302	00:26:20	00:26:23	Box 729.
303	00:26:27	00:26:29	Fire-resistant.
304	00:26:33	00:26:35	It's some kind of fabric. Silk, maybe.
305	00:26:35	00:26:37	What do you make of that?
306	00:26:37	00:26:39	Out of context, I don't know.
307	00:26:59	00:27:01	Pink Panther.
308	00:27:01	00:27:06	Well, Clouseau, how does blood get in a safe deposit box?
309	00:27:06	00:27:08	Maybe has something to do with this fabric.
310	00:27:09	00:27:14	Mr. Nine Volt, Rob Rubio-- ex-military, security expert.
311	00:27:14	00:27:24	Went to work for casino owner Sam Braun when one of his soft count cronies got caught skimming the skim, so... all roads lead to Rome, except, in this case... the Rampart.
312	00:28:10	00:28:12	Triple homicide in the desert.
313	00:28:12	00:28:14	Old-time Vegas.
314	00:28:14	00:28:16	We found Tommy The Aspirin out here.
315	00:28:16	00:28:17	Remember him?
316	00:28:17	00:28:19	Used to make his boss' headaches disappear.
317	00:28:19	00:28:20	Until they made him disappear.
318	00:28:21	00:28:23	I think this is the origin of the word termination.
319	00:28:23	00:28:26	There's the corporate way, and the way of the gun.
320	00:28:26	00:28:28	High-powered rifle.
321	00:28:28	00:28:29	Close range.
322	00:28:29	00:28:30	Visible gunpowder.
323	00:28:34	00:28:36	This guy got it in the chest, too.
324	00:28:37	00:28:39	And this one took it in the back.
325	00:28:41	00:28:43	This one's carrying a Glock.
326	00:28:43	00:28:44	Never got a chance to use it.
327	00:28:44	00:28:49	Well, all three were carrying, so they're not tied up, and they're still armed.
328	00:28:49	00:28:50	They didn't fly here.
329	00:28:50	00:28:52	Where's their car?
330	00:28:52	00:28:53	It's not a dump job.
331	00:28:53	00:28:58	Killer drove them here, killed them, and drove away.
332	00:28:58	00:28:59	They knew their attacker.
333	00:29:03	00:29:07	Never let a man do a woman's job.
334	00:29:07	00:29:08	What do you mean?
335	00:29:08	00:29:11	They didn't get all their makeup off.
336	00:29:12	00:29:14	Where's he going?
337	00:29:14	00:29:17	Let's just hope he stops.
338	00:29:27	00:29:29	Look familiar?
339	00:29:29	00:29:33	Bloodstain.
340	00:29:33	00:29:35	Rainbow-colored thread.
341	00:29:35	00:29:36	Safe deposit box.
342	00:29:36	00:29:38	Those guys are definitely the bank robbers.
343	00:29:38	00:29:39	Where's the fourth guy?
344	00:29:39	00:29:41	The guy who's rapidly becoming a mass murderer.
345	00:29:41	00:29:43	Rob Rubio.
346	00:29:50	00:29:51	Grissom, hey.
347	00:29:51	00:29:54	Grissom, hey, just tested the bullets from your trio in the desert.
348	00:29:54	00:29:56	Same GRCs as the bullet from Lockwood.
349	00:29:57	00:29:58	Fired from the same rifle.
350	00:29:58	00:29:59	Slow down, Bobby.
351	00:29:59	00:30:01	I'm sorry. I just got excited.
352	00:30:01	00:30:05	You don't get to see many .30-caliber rounds used in crimes, but, uh...
353	00:30:10	00:30:11	You rang?
354	00:30:11	00:30:13	Uh, yeah.
355	00:30:13	00:30:17	The, uh, blood flecks from the safe deposit box-- two distinct samples.
356	00:30:17	00:30:18	I only got one hit, though.
357	00:30:18	00:30:23	Uh, the primary sample belongs to Vivian Verona, a cocktail waitress.
358	00:30:23	00:30:26	She was killed on the top floor of the old Pike's Gambling Hall about two years ago.
359	00:30:26	00:30:28	Here's the report.
360	00:30:28	00:30:35	Multiple puncture wounds, different depths, possibly two knives...
361	00:30:35	00:30:39	I've pulled the crime scene photos for you, too.
362	00:30:39	00:30:40	Case still pending.
363	00:30:40	00:30:42	Murder weapon was never found.
364	00:30:42	00:30:44	Now, the secondary blood sample came back N.D.
365	00:30:44	00:30:46	Uh, could be the killer.
366	00:30:46	00:30:47	You always say murder's messy.
367	00:30:49	00:30:51	Greg, your hands are shaking.
368	00:30:51	00:30:53	No, they're not.
369	00:30:59	00:31:01	Hold your hands out.
370	00:31:01	00:31:03	Uh...
371	00:31:03	00:31:07	they've been shaking ever since...
372	00:31:12	00:31:14	I can't really make it stop.
373	00:31:14	00:31:15	Is it affecting your work?
374	00:31:15	00:31:18	Well, if I was a bomb expert, maybe.
375	00:31:19	00:31:21	No, I...
376	00:31:21	00:31:23	I think I have it under control.
377	00:31:23	00:31:26	It'll stop.
378	00:31:26	00:31:28	If you need me, I'll be around.
379	00:31:28	00:31:30	Okay.
380	00:31:54	00:31:57	I have your scarf back from Sanders.
381	00:32:03	00:32:08	I need you to open this evidence bag and cut me an identical piece of fabric.
382	00:32:10	00:32:12	You want me to replicate the blood pattern?
383	00:32:12	00:32:13	Yeah.
384	00:32:22	00:32:23	You guys need a hand?
385	00:32:25	00:32:28	Warrick, hand me those scissors.
386	00:32:30	00:32:33	Nick, give me that apple.
387	00:32:33	00:32:35	But I didn't get any lunch.
388	00:32:35	00:32:36	Give me the apple.
389	00:32:36	00:32:38	You're not supposed to eat in here.
390	00:32:43	00:32:46	Two puncture wounds, right?
391	00:32:55	00:32:57	Scissors.
392	00:32:57	00:33:00	That's what was wrapped in the scarf.
393	00:33:02	00:33:05	These don't look like your ordinary household pair.
394	00:33:05	00:33:07	No, man, look at the blades.
395	00:33:07	00:33:09	They're almost double the size of the handles.
396	00:33:09	00:33:12	What's the purpose of scissors that long?
397	00:33:12	00:33:13	Murder.
398	00:33:13	00:33:17	I hear scissors, I hear murder. What did I miss?
399	00:33:17	00:33:19	We may have the murder weapon.
400	00:33:19	00:33:24	Hey, Vivian Verona worked for Sam Braun-- a cocktail waitress at Pike's Gambling Hall.
401	00:33:24	00:33:27	Murdered the night before it was imploded in a penthouse suite.
402	00:33:27	00:33:29	Sounds like somebody wanted her to disappear in the rubble.
403	00:33:29	00:33:33	Bet you Braun hired his own clean-up crew for that one.
404	00:33:33	00:33:35	The pyro guys found her on their last walk-through.
405	00:33:35	00:33:38	They assigned a CSI, but the case ran cold before it even got started.
406	00:33:38	00:33:40	There was no suspect and no motive.
407	00:33:40	00:33:44	Warrick, enhance the blade area.
408	00:33:49	00:33:54	Hmm, let me see if I can flip it around so we're not looking at an eye chart.
409	00:33:54	00:33:58	R-P-R-T.
410	00:33:59	00:34:01	Rampart.
411	00:34:05	00:34:06	He's not returning any of my phone calls.
412	00:34:06	00:34:10	I just need to confront this Sam Braun business once and for all.
413	00:34:10	00:34:12	I'll drive.
414	00:34:13	00:34:15	I'm not going with you.
415	00:34:15	00:34:16	What do you mean?
416	00:34:19	00:34:22	I'm scheduled for surgery at Desert Palm.
417	00:34:24	00:34:26	Surgery?
418	00:34:34	00:34:36	Your hearing?
419	00:34:36	00:34:38	Yep.
420	00:34:41	00:34:42	I'm sorry.
421	00:34:42	00:34:46	I'm not. Has to be done.
422	00:34:46	00:34:47	What can I do?
423	00:34:47	00:34:50	Nothing. I'm fine.
424	00:34:50	00:34:52	Take care of the case.
425	00:34:52	00:34:53	Oh, eh, mm...
426	00:34:54	00:34:56	That's it?
427	00:34:56	00:34:58	That's it.
428	00:34:59	00:35:02	Um...
429	00:35:02	00:35:03	good luck.
430	00:35:28	00:35:30	You must really like the ham steak at the Primm.
431	00:35:33	00:35:35	One more mile north-- you're gone forever.
432	00:35:35	00:35:37	They got good ham.
433	00:35:37	00:35:39	That's good to know.
434	00:35:40	00:35:42	I'll know what to get you for your last meal...
435	00:35:42	00:35:44	for killing a cop.
436	00:35:44	00:35:48	You know the rifle we found in your trunk?
437	00:35:48	00:35:52	The bullets match one we pulled out of a friend of mine-- Detective Cyrus Lockwood.
438	00:35:52	00:35:56	Tough losing one of your own.
439	00:35:56	00:35:57	You lost three of yours.
440	00:35:57	00:36:00	Ballistics made a match there, too.
441	00:36:03	00:36:05	So, you're ex-military.
442	00:36:05	00:36:08	That why Sam Braun hired you to be head of security at the Rampart?
443	00:36:08	00:36:10	You asking me, or you telling me?
444	00:36:10	00:36:12	I'm telling you.
445	00:36:12	00:36:15	My guess is Sam needed a job done, he came to you.
446	00:36:15	00:36:22	You know, when I get out of here, I'm going to take pleasure in putting air in your head.
447	00:36:26	00:36:28	Let me put a fact in yours.
448	00:36:28	00:36:31	You left a lot of yourself behind, killer.
449	00:36:42	00:36:44	So, here's the deal.
450	00:36:45	00:36:50	You give up your boss, you get to spend the rest of your life in a jail cell, not on Death Row.
451	00:36:51	00:36:52	I'll take Death Row.
452	00:36:54	00:36:56	I'll live longer.
453	00:37:02	00:37:07	Tangiers, Pike's Gambling Hall...
454	00:37:07	00:37:09	Where are the Rampart scissors, Sam?
455	00:37:09	00:37:11	I think they went to one of those silent auctions.
456	00:37:11	00:37:14	You know, the kind where you put a number down and remain anonymous.
457	00:37:14	00:37:15	Uh-huh.
458	00:37:15	00:37:17	I'm sure they went to a good cause.
459	00:37:17	00:37:20	How much money they make?
460	00:37:20	00:37:23	More than I anticipated.
461	00:37:23	00:37:26	I think that we're past playing games, Sam.
462	00:37:26	00:37:30	I need the truth.
463	00:37:30	00:37:31	You sure about that?
464	00:37:31	00:37:33	Oh, yeah.
465	00:37:33	00:37:35	Now more than ever.
466	00:37:40	00:37:42	Benny killed Vivian.
467	00:37:42	00:37:45	He caught her cheating on him...
468	00:37:45	00:37:47	with me.
469	00:37:51	00:37:52	I can explain.
470	00:37:53	00:37:56	When I heard he was dying, I went to see him.
471	00:37:56	00:37:59	He told me he killed her with my scissors from a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
472	00:37:59	00:38:04	He always kept the scissors-- had them shadow-boxed for me.
473	00:38:07	00:38:10	He stashed them in the safe deposit box.
474	00:38:10	00:38:12	Why would Benny do that?
475	00:38:12	00:38:20	Why would Benny murder Vivian and then keep the incriminating evidence, not even attempt to wash off the blood?
476	00:38:20	00:38:23	You're asking me to answer on his behalf?
477	00:38:23	00:38:26	I don't know.
478	00:38:26	00:38:27	Maybe he was paranoid.
479	00:38:28	00:38:30	Figured you would drag Lake Mead.
480	00:38:30	00:38:31	Let me just get this straight.
481	00:38:31	00:38:45	To protect Benny after he's already dead, you hire Rob Rubio and three cronies to commit federal bank robbery to steal back a pair of scissors?
482	00:38:45	00:38:48	They weren't just any pair of scissors.
483	00:38:48	00:38:52	They were tied to a legacy.
484	00:38:52	00:38:56	If Benny goes down, I go down.
485	00:38:56	00:39:00	40 years...
486	00:39:01	00:39:04	building a reputation-- gone.
487	00:39:04	00:39:09	Games are meant to be played downstairs, not upstairs...
488	00:39:09	00:39:12	so I ask Rob to take care of it.
489	00:39:17	00:39:26	We have the safe deposit box in our possession, Sam, along with the bloodstained sash the scissors were wrapped in.
490	00:39:26	00:39:34	We recovered two different blood samples-- one belonging to Vivian, and the other unknown.
491	00:39:34	00:39:40	I guess I didn't have a good enough reason until now, but...
492	00:39:40	00:39:47	I tested my DNA against the unknown sample.
493	00:39:49	00:39:52	And wouldn't you know...
494	00:39:52	00:39:57	there were seven alleles in common.
495	00:40:02	00:40:05	That supposed to mean something?
496	00:40:05	00:40:10	It means that you and I are biologically related.
497	00:40:12	00:40:15	You killed her, Sam...
498	00:40:16	00:40:20	and Benny covered for you.
499	00:40:26	00:40:28	Part of the old double standard.
500	00:40:28	00:40:33	No woman that you're with is ever going to be with another man.
501	00:40:39	00:40:43	I swear on your mother...
502	00:40:43	00:40:45	it didn't happen that way.
503	00:40:45	00:40:48	Oh, now, that holds a lot of weight.
504	00:40:48	00:40:52	To this day my mother still sits at home waiting for your call.
505	00:40:57	00:41:02	Do you really think I could murder someone?
506	00:41:04	00:41:05	Science...
507	00:41:05	00:41:07	tells me that you did.
508	00:41:10	00:41:13	So, yes, I do.
509	00:41:17	00:41:21	It's just such a lousy way to find out that you're my father.
510	00:41:33	00:41:36	They're preparing the surgery right now, Mr. Grissom.
511	00:41:36	00:41:38	They'll be ready for you in moments.
512	00:41:47	00:41:48	Hey.
513	00:41:50	00:41:51	What are you doing here?
514	00:41:52	00:41:55	I just wanted to see you.
515	00:41:55	00:42:00	And I didn't want you to go in without wishing you good luck.
516	00:42:10	00:42:13	Thank you.
517	00:42:13	00:42:16	For being here.
518	00:42:28	00:42:30	I don't need that.
519	00:42:34	00:42:38	and Volkswagen.
