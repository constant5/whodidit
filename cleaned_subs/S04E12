1,00:02:19,00:02:22,(police radio plays indistinctly)
2,00:02:26,00:02:29,(siren blares distantly)
3,00:02:34,00:02:36,BRASS: Ready for us?
4,00:02:36,00:02:40,"For now, no one enters this house except CSI."
5,00:03:17,00:03:18,"Warrick, you got the car."
6,00:03:20,00:03:21,Which one?
7,00:03:21,00:03:22,Both.
8,00:03:22,00:03:23,"Uh, take the Honda."
9,00:03:23,00:03:27,"The VW belongs to the victim's friend, over there."
10,00:03:27,00:03:28,She called it in.
11,00:03:28,00:03:30,"BROWN: Aw, that's too bad."
12,00:03:30,00:03:32,This will be a day she'll never forget.
13,00:03:32,00:03:33,"Sara, you take the perimeter."
14,00:03:33,00:03:34,What?
15,00:03:34,00:03:36,You just did a one-hour walk-through.
16,00:03:36,00:03:37,The perimeter cannot be a priority.
17,00:03:37,00:03:39,I need you to work the outside.
18,00:03:39,00:03:40,Catherine and I will be inside.
19,00:03:43,00:03:44,I'll go talk to the friend.
20,00:03:44,00:03:47,Find out where she walked and what she might have touched in there.
21,00:03:50,00:03:53,"Hey, Jim."
22,00:03:53,00:03:54,Hmm?
23,00:03:54,00:03:57,Did you talk to that guy across the street?
24,00:03:57,00:03:59,The neighbor? He's on my list.
25,00:03:59,00:04:01,"Yeah, he looks like he has something to say."
26,00:04:05,00:04:07,"Hi, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the crime lab."
27,00:04:07,00:04:08,"What is your name, miss?"
28,00:04:08,00:04:11,Kelly McNeil.
29,00:04:11,00:04:13,Deb and I are best friends.
30,00:04:13,00:04:16,We were supposed to get together yesterday.
31,00:04:16,00:04:18,It was our day off.
32,00:04:18,00:04:19,You're a nurse?
33,00:04:19,00:04:21,Yeah. Both of us.
34,00:04:21,00:04:23,Desert Palm Hospital.
35,00:04:23,00:04:27,"We made lunch plans, but she canceled."
36,00:04:27,00:04:29,She give a reason why?
37,00:04:29,00:04:30,Michael. ! Michael?
38,00:04:30,00:04:31,Michael Clark.
39,00:04:31,00:04:34,"Um, she's been seeing him for a month or so."
40,00:04:34,00:04:35,He's a surgical intern.
41,00:04:35,00:04:39,"When she didn't show up for work today, I called the house."
42,00:04:39,00:04:43,"Her cell... no answer, so I drove by after shift."
43,00:04:43,00:04:45,And how did you get in?
44,00:04:45,00:04:48,We have each other's keys.
45,00:04:48,00:04:50,Did you touch anything inside?
46,00:04:50,00:04:52,No.
47,00:04:52,00:04:55,I walked in and...
48,00:04:55,00:04:57,I saw her and I ran out.
49,00:05:04,00:05:11,"Kelly, this, uh, Michael-- is he just a guy, or is he somebody special?"
50,00:05:11,00:05:15,He was the first guy that Debbie ever blew me off for.
51,00:05:15,00:05:17,"And did you see him today, at the hospital?"
52,00:05:17,00:05:22,No. I figured they were both playing hooky.
53,00:05:44,00:05:46,MAN: Moved in about two months ago.
54,00:05:46,00:05:47,Single girl. Alone in the house.
55,00:05:47,00:05:48,Got my attention.
56,00:05:48,00:05:50,I'm running for captain of the Neighborhood Watch.
57,00:05:50,00:05:56,"I'll probably have to self-appoint myself, but I'm going to put out a flyer, you know, about shutting doors, locking windows, I mean, the thing is..."
58,00:05:56,00:05:58,you just don't think it's going to happen to you.
59,00:05:58,00:05:59,You know what I'm saying?
60,00:05:59,00:06:01,"On your block... Listen, Pike. Stop talking."
61,00:06:01,00:06:05,I never seen somebody so excited about their neighbor being killed.
62,00:06:05,00:06:09,"Let me tell you something: I know the business of everyone up and down this block, all right?"
63,00:06:09,00:06:12,"Who's cheating on his wife, who's behind on his bills, whose kid's going to become the next Manson."
64,00:06:12,00:06:14,Let's talk about Debbie Marlin.
65,00:06:14,00:06:16,You know what they say about nurses.
66,00:06:16,00:06:17,What's that?
67,00:06:17,00:06:18,That-that they like to party.
68,00:06:20,00:06:22,"Hey, look. You see a stethoscope around this chest?"
69,00:06:22,00:06:24,No. You want to know why? I'm not a doctor.
70,00:06:24,00:06:26,So I couldn't even get close to her.
71,00:06:26,00:06:28,"Well, who is getting close?"
72,00:06:28,00:06:30,It's like a fricking doctor auto mall over there.
73,00:06:30,00:06:33,"You know, hunky surgeons, board certified, lots of dough."
74,00:06:33,00:06:35,"And if you want my opinion, I think they were dropping quarts."
75,00:06:36,00:06:41,"Okay, did you notice any automobiles, any cars out front?"
76,00:06:41,00:06:43,"You know, as a matter of fact, sir, yes."
77,00:06:43,00:06:45,"Black Mercedes, E320."
78,00:06:45,00:06:48,"2004 model, been there about a month."
79,00:06:48,00:06:49,Rolls in all hours.
80,00:06:49,00:06:52,"I'm figuring on call, booty call."
81,00:06:52,00:06:53,That kind of thing.
82,00:06:53,00:06:54,When's the last time you saw the Mercedes?
83,00:06:54,00:06:56,Two days ago. Around lunch.
84,00:06:56,00:06:58,"And, uh, I think he stayed for a little bit of dinner, too."
85,00:06:58,00:07:00,Thanks a lot.
86,00:07:00,00:07:02,"Yeah, this is Detective Jim Brass."
87,00:07:02,00:07:08,"See if you can find a 2004 Mercedes, black, registered to a Michael Clark, M.D."
88,00:07:08,00:07:10,Thanks.
89,00:07:10,00:07:13,I have absolutely nothing. How are you doing?
90,00:07:13,00:07:14,I got a lot.
91,00:07:15,00:07:16,Check out the backseat.
92,00:07:16,00:07:18,Bananas.
93,00:07:18,00:07:20,Stuffed Mushrooms.
94,00:07:20,00:07:23,"Chocolate syrup, a six-pack of soda, a box of condoms."
95,00:07:23,00:07:25,No surprises there.
96,00:07:25,00:07:27,Fresh bag of groceries in an unlocked car?
97,00:07:27,00:07:31,Maybe she was interrupted.
98,00:07:44,00:07:51,One thing I can never get over with this job: anything can happen to anybody.
99,00:07:53,00:07:55,That's why we're here.
100,00:08:04,00:08:09,I bet this bathroom was the reason she bought this place.
101,00:08:14,00:08:15,What am I smelling?
102,00:08:16,00:08:18,Cleanser.
103,00:08:18,00:08:20,Bleach maybe.
104,00:08:23,00:08:26,Arterial spray is neck high.
105,00:08:26,00:08:30,Indicates she was standing when she was attacked.
106,00:08:32,00:08:36,And the highest gush of blood has the most volume.
107,00:08:36,00:08:38,Definite lack of lividity. She must have bled out.
108,00:08:38,00:08:41,The killer had to get something on him.
109,00:08:41,00:08:43,"Had to be a bloody mess, but there's no..."
110,00:08:45,00:08:49,"footprints, there's no handprints, no smears."
111,00:08:49,00:08:54,She looks like she was placed in this position.
112,00:08:55,00:08:56,What's the message?
113,00:09:03,00:09:04,What do we got here?
114,00:09:04,00:09:06,Pendale's Milk.
115,00:09:06,00:09:10,Non-fat. Half a gallon. Unopened.
116,00:09:10,00:09:13,Groceries that made it inside.
117,00:09:13,00:09:17,Fancy crackers...
118,00:09:17,00:09:18,brie.
119,00:09:21,00:09:23,Coupons with no receipt.
120,00:09:23,00:09:26,No receipt?
121,00:09:26,00:09:28,This milk expires on the 23rd.
122,00:09:28,00:09:31,Eight days from now.
123,00:09:31,00:09:33,Milk is delivered daily to the supermarket.
124,00:09:33,00:09:34,That's a ten-day window.
125,00:09:34,00:09:36,People usually reach back for a fresh one.
126,00:09:36,00:09:38,Hmm...
127,00:09:39,00:09:40,Subtract ten from the 23rd?
128,00:09:40,00:09:43,She was at Pendale's two days ago.
129,00:09:43,00:09:47,"Well, according to Brass, that was the last time her boyfriend's car was seen out front."
130,00:10:25,00:10:27,Positive for both.
131,00:10:27,00:10:30,Same here.
132,00:10:30,00:10:33,"So there's blood in all four drains, followed by bleach."
133,00:10:33,00:10:36,He kills Debbie in the shower.
134,00:10:36,00:10:40,Then he washes up in both sinks and in the tub?
135,00:10:40,00:10:42,Why?
136,00:10:42,00:10:46,The answer is in the drains.
137,00:11:52,00:11:55,He cleaned everywhere but inside the shower.
138,00:11:55,00:12:01,WILLOWS: We're never going to know where the blood ends and the bleach begins.
139,00:12:01,00:12:03,Where's all this blood coming from?
140,00:12:07,00:12:09,Dr. Clark is on my surgical rotation.
141,00:12:09,00:12:12,He was scheduled to assist this morning.
142,00:12:12,00:12:13,No show.
143,00:12:13,00:12:14,Oh.
144,00:12:14,00:12:16,Was that like him?
145,00:12:16,00:12:18,No. It's completely out of character.
146,00:12:18,00:12:22,"See, half of these interns come in here so scared, they couldn't carve a turkey."
147,00:12:22,00:12:25,I have to give them scalpels with training wheels.
148,00:12:25,00:12:26,Clark was different.
149,00:12:26,00:12:30,"He, uh, he's a real artist, a steady hand."
150,00:12:30,00:12:32,"Yeah, he has a gift."
151,00:12:32,00:12:35,How about outside the O.R.?
152,00:12:35,00:12:36,Was he socially gifted?
153,00:12:36,00:12:41,"He turned a lot of nurses' heads, but it never interfered with his work."
154,00:12:41,00:12:42,Why the questions?
155,00:12:42,00:12:44,"Debbie Marlin, one of your nurses, was murdered."
156,00:12:44,00:12:45,Throat slashed.
157,00:12:45,00:12:47,You didn't know this?
158,00:12:47,00:12:53,"Dr. Clark and his ""steady hand"" haven't been seen or heard from since, so you don't have to be a brain surgeon to guess what I'm thinking."
159,00:12:53,00:12:57,(pager beeping) Uh... all I can ask is that I...
160,00:12:57,00:12:59,I hope that you're wrong about Dr. Clark.
161,00:12:59,00:13:00,Excuse me.
162,00:13:09,00:13:10,No cleansers.
163,00:13:10,00:13:16,"No rags, no sponges, no paper towels..."
164,00:13:16,00:13:19,You'd think that she restocked when she went shopping.
165,00:13:19,00:13:22,"Well, I'm thinking the killer used everything the victim had."
166,00:13:26,00:13:29,And then disposed of it.
167,00:13:43,00:13:44,(trash can lid thuds)
168,00:13:44,00:13:47,WILLOWS: Nothing.
169,00:13:56,00:13:57,(flies buzzing)
170,00:13:57,00:13:58,(lid thuds)
171,00:13:58,00:14:00,BROWN: Nothing here.
172,00:14:05,00:14:07,(buzzing)
173,00:15:09,00:15:12,I think I found the victim's internal organs.
174,00:15:14,00:15:16,This guy meant business.
175,00:15:19,00:15:22,I think I can confirm the victim's male.
176,00:15:25,00:15:29,It seems he vacuumed to remove any trace from the house.
177,00:15:31,00:15:34,WILLOWS: City picks up the evidence and spreads it all over the dump.
178,00:15:34,00:15:38,We have the victim's clothes.
179,00:15:38,00:15:39,Very neatly folded.
180,00:15:42,00:15:44,"BROWN: Well, if this is our boyfriend, then..."
181,00:15:46,00:15:48,...Brass is looking for a ghost.
182,00:15:48,00:15:50,(sighs)
183,00:16:32,00:16:33,Heard about the shower.
184,00:16:34,00:16:35,"Nurse, huh?"
185,00:16:35,00:16:38,"Multiple hairs, multiple donors."
186,00:16:38,00:16:40,"Looks like she had a few ""friends"" over."
187,00:16:40,00:16:43,A little Nurses Gone Wild.
188,00:16:48,00:16:49,Blanched.
189,00:16:49,00:16:53,Killer poured bleach down all the drains.
190,00:16:53,00:16:56,Talk about sucking all the life out of DNA.
191,00:16:56,00:16:58,"If there's anything left, it's probably denatured."
192,00:16:58,00:17:00,(quiet dripping)
193,00:17:09,00:17:12,Wait a minute.
194,00:17:14,00:17:16,"Wait, wait, wait..."
195,00:17:16,00:17:19,Bleach might have missed this one.
196,00:17:19,00:17:21,(gurgling)
197,00:17:23,00:17:25,Lucky for us...
198,00:17:25,00:17:28,we got a skin tag.
199,00:17:32,00:17:35,She's exsanguinated Time of death is anybody's guess.
200,00:17:36,00:17:38,"Rigor's past, so it's over 24 hours."
201,00:17:38,00:17:45,"Deep incised wound of the anterior and lateral neck, transecting both carotids and the anterior trachea."
202,00:17:45,00:17:47,Cut's clean.
203,00:17:47,00:17:50,"Extremely sharp, short instrument."
204,00:17:50,00:17:51,Scalpel?
205,00:17:51,00:17:53,That's what I'm thinking.
206,00:17:54,00:18:01,"You know, I caught a 25-pound yellowtail last year off the coast of Mexico, and it took me half an hour to filet."
207,00:18:01,00:18:10,"Dismembering an adult male with this precision and without cutting through the bone, 12 hours minimum."
208,00:18:10,00:18:11,Half a day.
209,00:18:11,00:18:13,That's patience.
210,00:18:13,00:18:17,"The, uh, patella was cleanly removed."
211,00:18:18,00:18:22,"And with one slice, the femur was separated from the tibia and the fibula."
212,00:18:22,00:18:25,There's a perverse elegance to this butchery.
213,00:18:25,00:18:28,"Oh, I'm not so sure I see it that way."
214,00:18:28,00:18:32,A killer with knowledge of anatomy whose tool is a scalpel.
215,00:18:32,00:18:35,I think the butcher was a doctor.
216,00:18:36,00:18:41,"So David, isolate all ten fingers, ink them, give Jacqui the ten-card."
217,00:18:42,00:18:43,We need to know who he is.
218,00:19:32,00:19:35,(cell phone ringing)
219,00:19:40,00:19:41,Grissom.
220,00:19:41,00:19:43,SIDLE: Hey.
221,00:19:43,00:19:47,"Sara, uh, listen, I'm in a bad area."
222,00:19:47,00:19:48,I'll call you back.
223,00:19:48,00:19:51,I got a skin tag off the bathtub drain pipe.
224,00:19:51,00:19:52,"Skin tag? That's great. Uh, give it to Greg."
225,00:19:53,00:19:54,"Yeah, I did."
226,00:19:54,00:19:56,"Hey, do you want me to come over there and give you a hand?"
227,00:19:56,00:19:58,"No, I-I'm fine."
228,00:19:58,00:20:00,"I'll-I'll, uh..."
229,00:20:00,00:20:02,I'll talk to you back at the lab.
230,00:20:02,00:20:04,(phone beeps)
231,00:20:12,00:20:15,"Hey, where'd Brass find the car?"
232,00:20:15,00:20:19,Long-term parking at McCarran.
233,00:20:19,00:20:20,Ran the plates.
234,00:20:20,00:20:22,R.O.-- Dr. Michael Clark.
235,00:20:22,00:20:25,The head of security is giving us a copy of the surveillance tape.
236,00:20:25,00:20:30,"So, he kills her and whoever she was with, and then he hops a plane?"
237,00:20:30,00:20:31,"Well, it seems like that."
238,00:20:31,00:20:33,You know what they say down at P.D.
239,00:20:33,00:20:36,The quickest way to get a car stolen is to leave it at the airport unlocked.
240,00:20:36,00:20:38,(door clunks open) See what I mean?
241,00:20:38,00:20:40,Who doesn't know that?
242,00:20:47,00:20:49,Black powder on a black dash.
243,00:20:49,00:20:50,I know.
244,00:20:50,00:20:53,"Let's just superglue it, huh?"
245,00:21:33,00:21:35,Wipes and swirls.
246,00:21:35,00:21:38,He cleaned everything but the driver's seat.
247,00:21:38,00:21:41,"Well, he had to drive himself to the airport, right?"
248,00:21:42,00:21:43,He put something on the seat.
249,00:21:43,00:21:46,"Whatever he put, he took it with him."
250,00:21:48,00:21:50,"The black, plastic bag."
251,00:21:53,00:21:55,He missed a piece.
252,00:21:55,00:22:00,"SIDLE: He puts a bag on the seat, and then he adjusts it."
253,00:22:01,00:22:05,"How tall was he? Five-nine, according to the DMV report?"
254,00:22:08,00:22:13,"Wow. I'm six-two, and this is more than enough room for me."
255,00:22:13,00:22:17,"So, whoever was driving this car, was way taller than five-nine."
256,00:22:17,00:22:20,"Two days ago, Debbie Marlin is off work."
257,00:22:20,00:22:22,"Sometime in the morning, she buys groceries."
258,00:22:22,00:22:24,"It's from Pendale's, the closest store in West Charleston."
259,00:22:25,00:22:29,"Brass talks to the box boy, remembered her, saw her just before his lunch break at 11:15."
260,00:22:30,00:22:33,Pendale's is about 20 minutes from her house.
261,00:22:33,00:22:34,Where's Nick?
262,00:22:34,00:22:37,American Academy of Forensics Science convention.
263,00:22:37,00:22:39,"GRISSOM: Hey, guys, can we continue, please?"
264,00:22:39,00:22:42,She comes home from the grocery store.
265,00:22:42,00:22:45,"She parks in the driveway, and she begins to unload."
266,00:22:47,00:22:48,Puts down her perishables first.
267,00:22:48,00:22:52,"She has to go back for second shifts, so she probably leaves the front door open."
268,00:22:52,00:22:55,Explains why there was no forced entry.
269,00:22:55,00:22:57,WILLOWS: Getting ready for a date.
270,00:22:57,00:22:58,Lighting candles.
271,00:22:58,00:23:00,Multitasking.
272,00:23:00,00:23:04,"BROWN: She opens up a bottle of wine, two glasses."
273,00:23:04,00:23:10,WILLOWS: Her girlfriend said that she was locking down for the afternoon with Michael Clark.
274,00:23:10,00:23:13,Nosy neighbor puts the Mercedes in the driveway sometime around noon.
275,00:23:13,00:23:14,Thought you guys would want to know.
276,00:23:15,00:23:18,The hair Sara found is a match to the bags of human tissue.
277,00:23:18,00:23:19,Prints confirm it.
278,00:23:19,00:23:20,"Per Jacqui, it's Michael Clark."
279,00:23:20,00:23:26,"WILLOWS: So, um, most of our efforts have been towards identifying another victim."
280,00:23:26,00:23:28,GRISSOM: Michael Clark.
281,00:23:28,00:23:30,But can we place him dead at the house?
282,00:23:30,00:23:33,"Greg, what else can you tell us about that hair?"
283,00:23:33,00:23:34,You mean hairs?
284,00:23:34,00:23:35,There were two.
285,00:23:35,00:23:38,"Ancillary, maybe arm or leg hair."
286,00:23:38,00:23:40,Found it in the tub drain.
287,00:23:40,00:23:41,The abattoir of choice...
288,00:23:41,00:23:44,for dismemberments.
289,00:23:44,00:23:49,"According to Jacqui, there were no prints found on the scalpel blades or handle, but the blood's a match to both victims."
290,00:23:49,00:23:51,So Michael Clark was dead in the tub.
291,00:23:51,00:23:53,We just don't know how he got there.
292,00:23:53,00:23:56,"Well, I KM'd the carpet at the threshold of the bathroom."
293,00:23:56,00:23:57,It's negative for blood.
294,00:23:57,00:24:01,"So all the violence took place in the bathroom, at least anything that had to do with blood."
295,00:24:01,00:24:06,"WILLOWS: The bathroom is big, but it's not big enough to kill two at the same time."
296,00:24:06,00:24:08,GRISSOM: She lights the candles in the shower.
297,00:24:08,00:24:11,Her back is to the door.
298,00:24:11,00:24:14,He grabs her from behind...
299,00:24:15,00:24:17,...and slits her throat.
300,00:24:20,00:24:28,Then he positions her body so that her face is the first thing the boyfriend sees when he walks in.
301,00:24:28,00:24:30,So he takes seconds to kill Debbie.
302,00:24:30,00:24:33,So why does he spend so much time cutting up Michael Clark?
303,00:24:33,00:24:37,Most likely because Michael Clark was the real focus of his rage.
304,00:25:23,00:25:25,Don't tell me you never went home?
305,00:25:26,00:25:28,Okay.
306,00:25:28,00:25:30,I just got started in here.
307,00:25:30,00:25:33,I haven't even gotten to the other rooms yet.
308,00:25:33,00:25:35,You know you lose your edge after 16 hours.
309,00:25:35,00:25:36,You're into your third shift.
310,00:25:36,00:25:40,"I mean, I'm all for overtime, but this is just plain greedy."
311,00:25:40,00:25:43,My knees can't take this anymore.
312,00:25:43,00:25:44,Have you eaten anything?
313,00:25:45,00:25:46,What did you bring?
314,00:25:47,00:25:49,I'll see what's in the fridge.
315,00:25:52,00:25:55,"We have to replace that, you know."
316,00:26:23,00:26:25,(coughs)
317,00:26:25,00:26:27,(coughing)
318,00:26:27,00:26:28,(coughs)
319,00:26:28,00:26:30,Hey... black lung.
320,00:26:30,00:26:31,"Ha, ha."
321,00:26:31,00:26:34,I've been sifting through this trash for about six hours.
322,00:26:34,00:26:37,You coming to rescue me or make fun of me?
323,00:26:37,00:26:39,I am just looking. Relax.
324,00:26:39,00:26:41,What are these white fibers here?
325,00:26:41,00:26:45,They must be from the spare bedroom because all the other carpets are green.
326,00:26:45,00:26:49,Spare bedroom wasn't on his entrance or exit path.
327,00:26:49,00:26:54,"Look, all I know is that they were near the top of the bag, so it must have been one of the last things he vacuumed."
328,00:26:56,00:27:01,"I did happen to find this butterfly pendant, with some white fibers on it."
329,00:27:01,00:27:09,"It looks like it's from a necklace or a bracelet and it has this link that snaps, so I'm thinking... sign of struggle?"
330,00:27:09,00:27:12,The killer was in that spare bedroom.
331,00:27:20,00:27:22,Feel better?
332,00:27:24,00:27:29,"Well, now that we fed you, we should probably talk about a shower."
333,00:27:30,00:27:32,I mean at your place.
334,00:27:32,00:27:33,You need to go home.
335,00:27:33,00:27:36,"As soon as we find some evidence, I promise."
336,00:27:36,00:27:38,"With fresh eyes, you won't miss it."
337,00:27:42,00:27:44,"Just talk it through with me, will you?"
338,00:27:44,00:27:45,What do we know?
339,00:27:45,00:27:48,All right.
340,00:27:48,00:28:02,"The bathroom is where things got started-- candles, oils, steam shower, cleaned up, oiled up, sexed up."
341,00:28:02,00:28:04,Let's go back to the bedroom.
342,00:28:10,00:28:12,"No, nothing on this sheet."
343,00:28:25,00:28:29,She changed her sheets for her date-- I would.
344,00:28:35,00:28:37,"Hey, Cath?"
345,00:28:39,00:28:42,Got silk?
346,00:28:48,00:28:51,"Why, yes, I do."
347,00:28:51,00:28:54,(wood creaking)
348,00:28:55,00:28:57,"I don't mean to embarrass you, but, um..."
349,00:28:59,00:29:01,...some guys need leverage.
350,00:29:01,00:29:03,(wood creaking)
351,00:29:03,00:29:05,They do?
352,00:29:05,00:29:06,I'll dust for prints.
353,00:29:06,00:29:10,(phone ringing)
354,00:29:11,00:29:14,Grissom.
355,00:29:14,00:29:17,"Hey, Warrick."
356,00:29:18,00:29:20,Butterfly? Where?
357,00:29:22,00:29:24,I haven't checked the spare bedroom.
358,00:29:24,00:29:26,I'll call you back.
359,00:30:32,00:30:34,Hang one.
360,00:30:34,00:30:35,Toe print.
361,00:30:35,00:30:38,I'll have Sara compare it against both victims.
362,00:30:38,00:30:39,Good.
363,00:30:39,00:30:43,Warrick found a butterfly charm in the vacuum bag.
364,00:30:44,00:30:47,I think I just found a piece from the same chain in this box.
365,00:30:48,00:30:50,"Butterfly, huh?"
366,00:30:50,00:30:52,She had a collection.
367,00:30:52,00:30:56,Gifts from her... gentlemen callers?
368,00:30:56,00:31:00,"Maybe the killer was taking his gift back, as in leave no trace."
369,00:31:00,00:31:05,Maybe he finally ran out of patience and got sloppy.
370,00:31:21,00:31:23,And this is why I didn't leave.
371,00:32:27,00:32:28,"Hey, you seen Grissom?"
372,00:32:28,00:32:30,He's still at the crime scene.
373,00:32:30,00:32:34,I eliminated both victims from the print you pulled off the bed.
374,00:32:34,00:32:37,"Well, we know she was fishing off the company pier."
375,00:32:39,00:32:40,"You, uh, seen Debbie?"
376,00:32:41,00:32:42,Yeah.
377,00:32:42,00:32:43,And?
378,00:32:43,00:32:46,"Yeah, I compared her toe prints."
379,00:32:46,00:32:48,If I didn't know better I'd think that was you on that table.
380,00:32:49,00:32:51,I didn't really look at her face.
381,00:32:54,00:32:56,"When you see Grissom, will you tell him?"
382,00:33:02,00:33:03,"MAN: Oh, that feels nice."
383,00:33:03,00:33:05,Do you have something to take this off?
384,00:33:05,00:33:06,"Just step on the card, please."
385,00:33:07,00:33:09,Good thing you caught me early in the shift.
386,00:33:09,00:33:11,"Yeah, lucky for me."
387,00:33:11,00:33:14,I think I could probably tell who pulled a double.
388,00:33:14,00:33:16,"Listen, I've got a patient waiting in pre-op."
389,00:33:17,00:33:18,We'll have you out in a minute.
390,00:33:18,00:33:22,We appreciate you providing your prints voluntarily.
391,00:33:25,00:33:28,"Well, there's probably a little bit of a lot of us in Debbie's house."
392,00:33:28,00:33:31,"Oh, we'll know soon enough."
393,00:33:33,00:33:34,Thank you.
394,00:33:34,00:33:36,"You understand, right?"
395,00:33:36,00:33:38,The police aren't the only ones with a code of honor.
396,00:33:38,00:33:43,"Now, some of these men are married, and if this gets out..."
397,00:33:43,00:33:46,Nothing gets out unless it needs to get out.
398,00:33:46,00:33:48,Got a match.
399,00:33:52,00:33:54,Dr. Tripton.
400,00:33:54,00:33:59,BRASS: I'm afraid your patient in pre-op is going to have to wait a little while longer.
401,00:34:07,00:34:09,Don't really know why I'm here.
402,00:34:09,00:34:12,Your toe print was found in Debbie Marlin's house.
403,00:34:12,00:34:16,Same house she was murdered in.
404,00:34:16,00:34:21,"Her car was in the shop, and I gave her a ride home one night, and she invited me in for a cup of coffee."
405,00:34:21,00:34:24,She didn't like anyone wearing shoes in the house.
406,00:34:25,00:34:26,Some Feng Shui thing.
407,00:34:26,00:34:29,"So, you Feng Shuied your way to the bed?"
408,00:34:30,00:34:32,She was provocative.
409,00:34:32,00:34:36,"You take your coat off, she has her clothes off."
410,00:34:37,00:34:39,She came on to me.
411,00:34:39,00:34:42,"Come on, Doc, let's do it."
412,00:34:45,00:34:47,Take a look.
413,00:34:53,00:34:56,"All right, well, let's talk about what's not open to interpretation."
414,00:34:56,00:34:59,Yours were the only prints found in the house.
415,00:34:59,00:35:04,Michael Clark was on your rotation-- he was on your surgical team the day he was killed.
416,00:35:04,00:35:07,You called in sick. Surgery was canceled.
417,00:35:07,00:35:11,"Freed him up to be with Debbie, who also had the day off. What luck."
418,00:35:11,00:35:13,My son had a ball game.
419,00:35:13,00:35:14,My daughter was at a swim meet.
420,00:35:14,00:35:17,"My wife was at a conference, and the surgery was elective."
421,00:35:17,00:35:19,Not a stretch.
422,00:35:19,00:35:20,Your wife know about you and Debbie?
423,00:35:20,00:35:22,No.
424,00:35:22,00:35:23,"She asked for sex, right?"
425,00:35:23,00:35:25,"She also asked for the bracelet, too, huh?"
426,00:35:27,00:35:30,"No, but... I gave it to her."
427,00:35:30,00:35:32,This one.
428,00:35:32,00:35:34,She loved butterflies.
429,00:35:34,00:35:39,"Uh, I figured if I gave something special to her, she'd give something special to me."
430,00:35:40,00:35:41,Hmm.
431,00:35:42,00:35:43,So it was a long-term relationship?
432,00:35:47,00:35:50,SANDERS: That's the spare bedroom hair.
433,00:35:52,00:35:55,There's an oily film on the surface of the hair.
434,00:35:55,00:35:56,Propylene glycol.
435,00:35:57,00:36:00,Active ingredient in Rogaine for male pattern baldness.
436,00:36:00,00:36:06,"Personally, I don't use the stuff, but my grandfather, Papa Olaf-- he was Bruce Willis at age 16."
437,00:36:07,00:36:12,"Lucky for me, baldness comes from the mother's side, so I'm safe... Greg, please, I'm very tired."
438,00:36:12,00:36:15,"Well, maybe the guy we're looking for is going bald..."
439,00:36:15,00:36:16,or trying not to.
440,00:36:16,00:36:22,"According to Papa Olaf, a lot of guys who use Rogaine also use Propecia, kind of like a cocktail."
441,00:36:22,00:36:23,I ran the hair through MassSpec.
442,00:36:24,00:36:30,"I got four peaks: ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, minoxidil, and finasteride."
443,00:36:30,00:36:34,"Finasteride, the chemical name for Propecia."
444,00:36:34,00:36:37,"But wait, there's more, and it's a family secret."
445,00:36:37,00:36:40,Sexual. Happens in less than two percent of users.
446,00:36:40,00:36:43,(whispering): Papa Olaf was one of those guys that needed hydraulics.
447,00:36:51,00:36:53,Oh.
448,00:36:53,00:36:55,The prodigal CSI returns.
449,00:36:55,00:36:56,You get any sleep?
450,00:36:56,00:36:58,Not yet.
451,00:36:59,00:37:01,"So, uh, Brass had to let Dr. Tripton go."
452,00:37:01,00:37:02,The old sex alibi.
453,00:37:03,00:37:06,Too bad he didn't leave a toe print on a scalpel blade.
454,00:37:06,00:37:07,You got a take on him?
455,00:37:07,00:37:11,"Balloon head, but credible... like most adulterers."
456,00:37:11,00:37:12,Is he going bald?
457,00:37:12,00:37:13,Not really.
458,00:37:13,00:37:15,Grey hair?
459,00:37:15,00:37:17,No.
460,00:37:17,00:37:19,Anything else?
461,00:37:19,00:37:21,He's a lefty.
462,00:37:21,00:37:23,"Okay, keep in mind, this is just a theory."
463,00:37:23,00:37:27,It's a hot button issue among forensic pathologists.
464,00:37:27,00:37:34,What's the consensus? Most doctors say it's impossible to prove handedness based on the wounds inflicted on a victim.
465,00:37:34,00:37:36,Forget hard science. What's your hypothesis?
466,00:37:36,00:37:42,"Based on micro-incisions and hesitation marks, the victim was lying face up when he was killed."
467,00:37:42,00:37:46,Take a look at the right knee.
468,00:37:46,00:37:53,"The cut on the cartilage of the right distal femur has slight angulations from the, uh..."
469,00:37:53,00:37:57,"left distal to the right proximal, which suggests the killer was left-handed."
470,00:37:57,00:38:05,"This angulation is consistent with cuts made to the acetabulum and to the wrist, but bear in mind, it's not going to be admissible in court."
471,00:38:05,00:38:08,I don't care about court.
472,00:38:08,00:38:14,"My mind's on a left-handed, Propecia-using surgeon who's probably on staff at Desert Palm."
473,00:38:46,00:38:48,There was no need for the light show.
474,00:38:48,00:38:50,All you had to do was ask.
475,00:38:50,00:38:52,Good.
476,00:38:52,00:38:54,Since we're being completely honest...
477,00:38:54,00:38:56,are you losing your hair?
478,00:38:56,00:38:59,I'm a 48-year-old man. I'm not unique.
479,00:39:00,00:39:01,"Your hair is, though."
480,00:39:02,00:39:05,We found it at the crime scene.
481,00:39:05,00:39:08,Minoxidil absorbs infrared light.
482,00:39:10,00:39:13,I-I take Rogaine and Propecia.
483,00:39:13,00:39:26,"Again, not unique. Well, we think that Debbie Marlin and Michael Clark were killed by a surgeon who is left-handed, and we know of two left-handed surgeons at Desert Palm: Dr. Tripton, who has an alibi, and you."
484,00:39:26,00:39:31,"Well, if you're going to make accusations, you should really do your homework."
485,00:39:31,00:39:34,Howard and I are the only lefties on staff.
486,00:39:34,00:39:37,"Dr. Randolph, who has privileges at the hospital, he's also a lefty."
487,00:39:37,00:39:39,We play tennis every Wednesday.
488,00:39:39,00:39:41,He's got a heck of a back-hand.
489,00:39:42,00:39:48,"If you want me to name more names, I could, but you don't want me to do your job for you, do you?"
490,00:39:48,00:39:49,Gentlemen...
491,00:39:49,00:39:57,"we're here as a courtesy, so if you're quite through wasting our time, I think that the doctor would like to get back to the business of saving lives."
492,00:39:57,00:39:58,Not so fast.
493,00:39:58,00:40:02,Is this a link from a bracelet you gave Debbie?
494,00:40:04,00:40:06,Mm-hmm. It looks like it.
495,00:40:06,00:40:08,Where's the rest of it?
496,00:40:08,00:40:11,This link was vacuumed from the floor of the spare bedroom after the murder.
497,00:40:11,00:40:12,The other link was in her jewelry box.
498,00:40:12,00:40:19,The funny thing is that all the bracelets from the other guys she slept with are intact.
499,00:40:19,00:40:25,"Well, all I can tell you is when I gave it to her, it was in one piece."
500,00:40:33,00:40:35,Do you have any other evidence?
501,00:40:36,00:40:39,"No, we don't."
502,00:40:39,00:40:42,"We might not have any other evidence, but we have a theory."
503,00:40:42,00:40:44,That's not admissible in court.
504,00:40:44,00:40:46,"Oh, no, no, it's worth a listen."
505,00:40:51,00:40:57,"We think you killed Debbie Marlin because she rejected you, and Michael Clark paid the price."
506,00:41:02,00:41:09,"Thank you for your time and your theories, but you said it yourself: you don't have a case."
507,00:41:09,00:41:11,Doctor.
508,00:41:16,00:41:18,"It's sad, isn't it, Doc?"
509,00:41:19,00:41:21,Guys like us.
510,00:41:23,00:41:27,Couple of middle-aged men who've allowed their work to consume their lives.
511,00:41:29,00:41:34,The only time we ever touch other people is when we're wearing our latex gloves.
512,00:41:36,00:41:41,We wake up one day and realize that for 50 years we haven't really lived at all.
513,00:41:43,00:41:47,"But then, all of a sudden..."
514,00:41:47,00:41:49,we get a second chance.
515,00:41:52,00:41:54,Somebody young and beautiful shows up.
516,00:41:54,00:41:55,Somebody...
517,00:41:55,00:41:58,we could care about.
518,00:41:58,00:42:01,She offers us a new life with her...
519,00:42:03,00:42:06,"...but we have a big decision to make, right?"
520,00:42:06,00:42:11,Because we have to risk everything we've worked for in order to have her.
521,00:42:15,00:42:19,I couldn't do it...
522,00:42:19,00:42:21,but you did.
523,00:42:23,00:42:26,You risked it all...
524,00:42:26,00:42:30,"and she showed you a wonderful life, didn't she?"
525,00:42:34,00:42:40,"But then she took it away and gave it to somebody else, and you were lost."
526,00:42:43,00:42:45,So you took her life.
527,00:42:51,00:42:54,"Debbie, it's me, Michael."
528,00:42:58,00:43:03,"GRISSOM: You killed them both, and now you have nothing."
529,00:43:05,00:43:07,I'm still here.
530,00:43:08,00:43:10,Are you?
