0	00:02:34	00:02:36	Ready for us?
1	00:02:36	00:02:40	For now, no one enters this house except CSI.
2	00:03:17	00:03:18	Warrick, you got the car.
3	00:03:20	00:03:21	Which one?
4	00:03:21	00:03:22	Both.
5	00:03:22	00:03:23	Uh, take the Honda.
6	00:03:23	00:03:27	The VW belongs to the victim's friend, over there.
7	00:03:27	00:03:28	She called it in.
8	00:03:28	00:03:30	Aw, that's too bad.
9	00:03:30	00:03:32	This will be a day she'll never forget.
10	00:03:32	00:03:33	Sara, you take the perimeter.
11	00:03:33	00:03:34	What?
12	00:03:34	00:03:36	You just did a one-hour walk-through.
13	00:03:36	00:03:37	The perimeter cannot be a priority.
14	00:03:37	00:03:39	I need you to work the outside.
15	00:03:39	00:03:40	Catherine and I will be inside.
16	00:03:43	00:03:44	I'll go talk to the friend.
17	00:03:44	00:03:47	Find out where she walked and what she might have touched in there.
18	00:03:50	00:03:53	Hey, Jim.
19	00:03:53	00:03:54	Hmm?
20	00:03:54	00:03:57	Did you talk to that guy across the street?
21	00:03:57	00:03:59	The neighbor? He's on my list.
22	00:03:59	00:04:01	Yeah, he looks like he has something to say.
23	00:04:05	00:04:07	Hi, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the crime lab.
24	00:04:07	00:04:08	What is your name, miss?
25	00:04:08	00:04:11	Kelly McNeil.
26	00:04:11	00:04:13	Deb and I are best friends.
27	00:04:13	00:04:16	We were supposed to get together yesterday.
28	00:04:16	00:04:18	It was our day off.
29	00:04:18	00:04:19	You're a nurse?
30	00:04:19	00:04:21	Yeah. Both of us.
31	00:04:21	00:04:23	Desert Palm Hospital.
32	00:04:23	00:04:27	We made lunch plans, but she canceled.
33	00:04:27	00:04:29	She give a reason why?
34	00:04:29	00:04:30	Michael. ! Michael?
35	00:04:30	00:04:31	Michael Clark.
36	00:04:31	00:04:34	Um, she's been seeing him for a month or so.
37	00:04:34	00:04:35	He's a surgical intern.
38	00:04:35	00:04:39	When she didn't show up for work today, I called the house.
39	00:04:39	00:04:43	Her cell... no answer, so I drove by after shift.
40	00:04:43	00:04:45	And how did you get in?
41	00:04:45	00:04:48	We have each other's keys.
42	00:04:48	00:04:50	Did you touch anything inside?
43	00:04:50	00:04:52	No.
44	00:04:52	00:04:55	I walked in and...
45	00:04:55	00:04:57	I saw her and I ran out.
46	00:05:04	00:05:11	Kelly, this, uh, Michael-- is he just a guy, or is he somebody special?
47	00:05:11	00:05:15	He was the first guy that Debbie ever blew me off for.
48	00:05:15	00:05:17	And did you see him today, at the hospital?
49	00:05:17	00:05:22	No. I figured they were both playing hooky.
50	00:05:44	00:05:46	Moved in about two months ago.
51	00:05:46	00:05:47	Single girl. Alone in the house.
52	00:05:47	00:05:48	Got my attention.
53	00:05:48	00:05:50	I'm running for captain of the Neighborhood Watch.
54	00:05:50	00:05:56	I'll probably have to self-appoint myself, but I'm going to put out a flyer, you know, about shutting doors, locking windows, I mean, the thing is...
55	00:05:56	00:05:58	you just don't think it's going to happen to you.
56	00:05:58	00:05:59	You know what I'm saying?
57	00:05:59	00:06:01	On your block... Listen, Pike. Stop talking.
58	00:06:01	00:06:05	I never seen somebody so excited about their neighbor being killed.
59	00:06:05	00:06:09	I know the business of everyone up and down this block, all right?
60	00:06:09	00:06:12	Who's cheating on his wife, who's behind on his bills, whose kid's going to become the next Manson.
61	00:06:12	00:06:14	Let's talk about Debbie Marlin.
62	00:06:14	00:06:16	You know what they say about nurses.
63	00:06:16	00:06:17	What's that?
64	00:06:17	00:06:18	That-that they like to party.
65	00:06:20	00:06:22	Hey, look. You see a stethoscope around this chest?
66	00:06:22	00:06:24	No. You want to know why? I'm not a doctor.
67	00:06:24	00:06:26	So I couldn't even get close to her.
68	00:06:26	00:06:28	Well, who is getting close?
69	00:06:28	00:06:30	It's like a fricking doctor auto mall over there.
70	00:06:30	00:06:33	You know, hunky surgeons, board certified, lots of dough.
71	00:06:33	00:06:35	And if you want my opinion, I think they were dropping quarts.
72	00:06:36	00:06:41	Okay, did you notice any automobiles, any cars out front?
73	00:06:41	00:06:43	You know, as a matter of fact, sir, yes.
74	00:06:43	00:06:45	Black Mercedes, E320.
75	00:06:45	00:06:48	2004 model, been there about a month.
76	00:06:48	00:06:49	Rolls in all hours.
77	00:06:49	00:06:52	I'm figuring on call, booty call.
78	00:06:52	00:06:53	That kind of thing.
79	00:06:53	00:06:54	When's the last time you saw the Mercedes?
80	00:06:54	00:06:56	Two days ago. Around lunch.
81	00:06:56	00:06:58	And, uh, I think he stayed for a little bit of dinner, too.
82	00:06:58	00:07:00	Thanks a lot.
83	00:07:00	00:07:02	Yeah, this is Detective Jim Brass.
84	00:07:02	00:07:08	See if you can find a 2004 Mercedes, black, registered to a Michael Clark, M.D.
85	00:07:08	00:07:10	Thanks.
86	00:07:10	00:07:13	I have absolutely nothing. How are you doing?
87	00:07:13	00:07:14	I got a lot.
88	00:07:15	00:07:16	Check out the backseat.
89	00:07:16	00:07:18	Bananas.
90	00:07:18	00:07:20	Stuffed Mushrooms.
91	00:07:20	00:07:23	Chocolate syrup, a six-pack of soda, a box of condoms.
92	00:07:23	00:07:25	No surprises there.
93	00:07:25	00:07:27	Fresh bag of groceries in an unlocked car?
94	00:07:27	00:07:31	Maybe she was interrupted.
95	00:07:44	00:07:51	One thing I can never anything can happen to anybody.
96	00:07:53	00:07:55	That's why we're here.
97	00:08:04	00:08:09	I bet this bathroom was the reason she bought this place.
98	00:08:14	00:08:15	What am I smelling?
99	00:08:16	00:08:18	Cleanser.
100	00:08:18	00:08:20	Bleach maybe.
101	00:08:23	00:08:26	Arterial spray is neck high.
102	00:08:26	00:08:30	Indicates she was standing when she was attacked.
103	00:08:32	00:08:36	And the highest gush of blood has the most volume.
104	00:08:36	00:08:38	Definite lack of lividity. She must have bled out.
105	00:08:38	00:08:41	The killer had to get something on him.
106	00:08:41	00:08:43	Had to be a bloody mess, but there's no...
107	00:08:45	00:08:49	footprints, there's no handprints, no smears.
108	00:08:49	00:08:54	She looks like she was placed in this position.
109	00:08:55	00:08:56	What's the message?
110	00:09:03	00:09:04	What do we got here?
111	00:09:04	00:09:06	Pendale's Milk.
112	00:09:06	00:09:10	Non-fat. Half a gallon. Unopened.
113	00:09:10	00:09:13	Groceries that made it inside.
114	00:09:13	00:09:17	Fancy crackers...
115	00:09:17	00:09:18	brie.
116	00:09:21	00:09:23	Coupons with no receipt.
117	00:09:23	00:09:26	No receipt?
118	00:09:26	00:09:28	This milk expires on the 23rd.
119	00:09:28	00:09:31	Eight days from now.
120	00:09:31	00:09:33	Milk is delivered daily to the supermarket.
121	00:09:33	00:09:34	That's a ten-day window.
122	00:09:34	00:09:36	People usually reach back for a fresh one.
123	00:09:36	00:09:38	Hmm...
124	00:09:39	00:09:40	Subtract ten from the 23rd?
125	00:09:40	00:09:43	She was at Pendale's two days ago.
126	00:09:43	00:09:47	Well, according to Brass, that was the last time her boyfriend's car was seen out front.
127	00:10:25	00:10:27	Positive for both.
128	00:10:27	00:10:30	Same here.
129	00:10:30	00:10:33	So there's blood in all four drains, followed by bleach.
130	00:10:33	00:10:36	He kills Debbie in the shower.
131	00:10:36	00:10:40	Then he washes up in both sinks and in the tub?
132	00:10:40	00:10:42	Why?
133	00:10:42	00:10:46	The answer is in the drains.
134	00:11:52	00:11:55	He cleaned everywhere but inside the shower.
135	00:11:55	00:12:01	We're never going to know where the blood ends and the bleach begins.
136	00:12:01	00:12:03	Where's all this blood coming from?
137	00:12:07	00:12:09	Dr. Clark is on my surgical rotation.
138	00:12:09	00:12:12	He was scheduled to assist this morning.
139	00:12:12	00:12:13	No show.
140	00:12:13	00:12:14	Oh.
141	00:12:14	00:12:16	Was that like him?
142	00:12:16	00:12:18	No. It's completely out of character.
143	00:12:18	00:12:22	See, half of these interns come in here so scared, they couldn't carve a turkey.
144	00:12:22	00:12:25	I have to give them scalpels with training wheels.
145	00:12:25	00:12:26	Clark was different.
146	00:12:26	00:12:30	He, uh, he's a real artist, a steady hand.
147	00:12:30	00:12:32	Yeah, he has a gift.
148	00:12:32	00:12:35	How about outside the O.R.?
149	00:12:35	00:12:36	Was he socially gifted?
150	00:12:36	00:12:41	He turned a lot of nurses' heads, but it never interfered with his work.
151	00:12:41	00:12:42	Why the questions?
152	00:12:42	00:12:44	Debbie Marlin, one of your nurses, was murdered.
153	00:12:44	00:12:45	Throat slashed.
154	00:12:45	00:12:47	You didn't know this?
155	00:12:47	00:12:53	Dr. Clark and his steady hand haven't been seen or heard from since, so you don't have to be a brain surgeon to guess what I'm thinking.
156	00:12:53	00:12:57	( pager beeping ) Uh... all I can ask is that I...
157	00:12:57	00:12:59	I hope that you're wrong about Dr. Clark.
158	00:12:59	00:13:00	Excuse me.
159	00:13:09	00:13:10	No cleansers.
160	00:13:10	00:13:16	No rags, no sponges, no paper towels...
161	00:13:16	00:13:19	You'd think that she restocked when she went shopping.
162	00:13:19	00:13:22	Well, I'm thinking the killer used everything the victim had.
163	00:13:26	00:13:29	And then disposed of it.
164	00:13:44	00:13:47	Nothing.
165	00:13:58	00:14:00	Nothing here.
166	00:15:09	00:15:12	I think I found the victim's internal organs.
167	00:15:14	00:15:16	This guy meant business.
168	00:15:19	00:15:22	I think I can confirm the victim's male.
169	00:15:25	00:15:29	It seems he vacuumed to remove any trace from the house.
170	00:15:31	00:15:34	City picks up the evidence and spreads it all over the dump.
171	00:15:34	00:15:38	We have the victim's clothes.
172	00:15:38	00:15:39	Very neatly folded.
173	00:15:42	00:15:44	Well, if this is our boyfriend, then...
174	00:15:46	00:15:48	...Brass is looking for a ghost.
175	00:16:32	00:16:33	Heard about the shower.
176	00:16:34	00:16:35	Nurse, huh?
177	00:16:35	00:16:38	Multiple hairs, multiple donors.
178	00:16:38	00:16:40	Looks like she had a few friends over.
179	00:16:40	00:16:43	A little Nurses Gone Wild.
180	00:16:48	00:16:49	Blanched.
181	00:16:49	00:16:53	Killer poured bleach down all the drains.
182	00:16:53	00:16:56	Talk about sucking all the life out of DNA.
183	00:16:56	00:16:58	If there's anything left, it's probably denatured.
184	00:17:09	00:17:12	Wait a minute.
185	00:17:14	00:17:16	Wait, wait, wait...
186	00:17:16	00:17:19	Bleach might have missed this one.
187	00:17:23	00:17:25	Lucky for us...
188	00:17:25	00:17:28	we got a skin tag.
189	00:17:32	00:17:35	She's exsanguinated Time of death is anybody's guess.
190	00:17:36	00:17:38	Rigor's past, so it's over 24 hours.
191	00:17:38	00:17:45	Deep incised wound of the anterior and lateral neck, transecting both carotids and the anterior trachea.
192	00:17:45	00:17:47	Cut's clean.
193	00:17:47	00:17:50	Extremely sharp, short instrument.
194	00:17:50	00:17:51	Scalpel?
195	00:17:51	00:17:53	That's what I'm thinking.
196	00:17:54	00:18:01	You know, I caught a 25-pound yellowtail last year off the coast of Mexico, and it took me half an hour to filet.
197	00:18:01	00:18:10	Dismembering an adult male with this precision and without cutting through the bone, 12 hours minimum.
198	00:18:10	00:18:11	Half a day.
199	00:18:11	00:18:13	That's patience.
200	00:18:13	00:18:17	The, uh, patella was cleanly removed.
201	00:18:18	00:18:22	And with one slice, the femur was separated from the tibia and the fibula.
202	00:18:22	00:18:25	There's a perverse elegance to this butchery.
203	00:18:25	00:18:28	Oh, I'm not so sure I see it that way.
204	00:18:28	00:18:32	A killer with knowledge of anatomy whose tool is a scalpel.
205	00:18:32	00:18:35	I think the butcher was a doctor.
206	00:18:36	00:18:41	So David, isolate all ten fingers, ink them, give Jacqui the ten-card.
207	00:18:42	00:18:43	We need to know who he is.
208	00:19:40	00:19:41	Grissom.
209	00:19:41	00:19:43	Hey.
210	00:19:43	00:19:47	Sara, uh, listen, I'm in a bad area.
211	00:19:47	00:19:48	I'll call you back.
212	00:19:48	00:19:51	I got a skin tag off the bathtub drain pipe.
213	00:19:51	00:19:52	Skin tag? That's great. Uh, give it to Greg.
214	00:19:53	00:19:54	Yeah, I did.
215	00:19:54	00:19:56	Hey, do you want me to come over there and give you a hand?
216	00:19:56	00:19:58	No, I-I'm fine.
217	00:19:58	00:20:00	I'll-I'll, uh...
218	00:20:00	00:20:02	I'll talk to you back at the lab.
219	00:20:12	00:20:15	Hey, where'd Brass find the car?
220	00:20:15	00:20:19	Long-term parking at McCarran.
221	00:20:19	00:20:20	Ran the plates.
222	00:20:20	00:20:22	R.O.-- Dr. Michael Clark.
223	00:20:22	00:20:25	The head of security is giving us a copy of the surveillance tape.
224	00:20:25	00:20:30	So, he kills her and whoever she was with, and then he hops a plane?
225	00:20:30	00:20:31	Well, it seems like that.
226	00:20:31	00:20:33	You know what they say down at P.D.
227	00:20:33	00:20:36	The quickest way to get a car stolen is to leave it at the airport unlocked.
228	00:20:36	00:20:38	( door clunks open ) See what I mean?
229	00:20:38	00:20:40	Who doesn't know that?
230	00:20:47	00:20:49	Black powder on a black dash.
231	00:20:49	00:20:50	I know.
232	00:20:50	00:20:53	Let's just superglue it, huh?
233	00:21:33	00:21:35	Wipes and swirls.
234	00:21:35	00:21:38	He cleaned everything but the driver's seat.
235	00:21:38	00:21:41	Well, he had to drive himself to the airport, right?
236	00:21:42	00:21:43	He put something on the seat.
237	00:21:43	00:21:46	Whatever he put, he took it with him.
238	00:21:48	00:21:50	The black, plastic bag.
239	00:21:53	00:21:55	He missed a piece.
240	00:21:55	00:22:00	He puts a bag on the seat, and then he adjusts it.
241	00:22:01	00:22:05	How tall was he? Five-nine, according to the DMV report?
242	00:22:08	00:22:13	Wow. I'm six-two, and this is more than enough room for me.
243	00:22:13	00:22:17	So, whoever was driving this car, was way taller than five-nine.
244	00:22:17	00:22:20	Two days ago, Debbie Marlin is off work.
245	00:22:20	00:22:22	Sometime in the morning, she buys groceries.
246	00:22:22	00:22:24	It's from Pendale's, the closest store in West Charleston.
247	00:22:25	00:22:29	Brass talks to the box boy, remembered her, 15.
248	00:22:30	00:22:33	Pendale's is about 20 minutes from her house.
249	00:22:33	00:22:34	Where's Nick?
250	00:22:34	00:22:37	American Academy of Forensics Science convention.
251	00:22:37	00:22:39	Hey, guys, can we continue, please?
252	00:22:39	00:22:42	She comes home from the grocery store.
253	00:22:42	00:22:45	She parks in the driveway, and she begins to unload.
254	00:22:47	00:22:48	Puts down her perishables first.
255	00:22:48	00:22:52	She has to go back for second shifts, so she probably leaves the front door open.
256	00:22:52	00:22:55	Explains why there was no forced entry.
257	00:22:55	00:22:57	Getting ready for a date.
258	00:22:57	00:22:58	Lighting candles.
259	00:22:58	00:23:00	Multitasking.
260	00:23:00	00:23:04	She opens up a bottle of wine, two glasses.
261	00:23:04	00:23:10	Her girlfriend said that she was locking down for the afternoon with Michael Clark.
262	00:23:10	00:23:13	Nosy neighbor puts the Mercedes in the driveway sometime around noon.
263	00:23:13	00:23:14	Thought you guys would want to know.
264	00:23:15	00:23:18	The hair Sara found is a match to the bags of human tissue.
265	00:23:18	00:23:19	Prints confirm it.
266	00:23:19	00:23:20	Per Jacqui, it's Michael Clark.
267	00:23:20	00:23:26	So, um, most of our efforts have been towards identifying another victim.
268	00:23:26	00:23:28	Michael Clark.
269	00:23:28	00:23:30	But can we place him dead at the house?
270	00:23:30	00:23:33	Greg, what else can you tell us about that hair?
271	00:23:33	00:23:34	You mean hairs?
272	00:23:34	00:23:35	There were two.
273	00:23:35	00:23:38	Ancillary, maybe arm or leg hair.
274	00:23:38	00:23:40	Found it in the tub drain.
275	00:23:40	00:23:41	The abattoir of choice...
276	00:23:41	00:23:44	for dismemberments.
277	00:23:44	00:23:49	According to Jacqui, there were no prints found on the scalpel blades or handle, but the blood's a match to both victims.
278	00:23:49	00:23:51	So Michael Clark was dead in the tub.
279	00:23:51	00:23:53	We just don't know how he got there.
280	00:23:53	00:23:56	Well, I KM'd the carpet at the threshold of the bathroom.
281	00:23:56	00:23:57	It's negative for blood.
282	00:23:57	00:24:01	So all the violence took place in the bathroom, at least anything that had to do with blood.
283	00:24:01	00:24:06	The bathroom is big, but it's not big enough to kill two at the same time.
284	00:24:06	00:24:08	She lights the candles in the shower.
285	00:24:08	00:24:11	Her back is to the door.
286	00:24:11	00:24:14	He grabs her from behind...
287	00:24:15	00:24:17	...and slits her throat.
288	00:24:20	00:24:28	Then he positions her body so that her face is the first thing the boyfriend sees when he walks in.
289	00:24:28	00:24:30	So he takes seconds to kill Debbie.
290	00:24:30	00:24:33	So why does he spend so much time cutting up Michael Clark?
291	00:24:33	00:24:37	Most likely because Michael Clark was the real focus of his rage.
292	00:25:23	00:25:25	Don't tell me you never went home?
293	00:25:26	00:25:28	Okay.
294	00:25:28	00:25:30	I just got started in here.
295	00:25:30	00:25:33	I haven't even gotten to the other rooms yet.
296	00:25:33	00:25:35	You know you lose your edge after 16 hours.
297	00:25:35	00:25:36	You're into your third shift.
298	00:25:36	00:25:40	I mean, I'm all for overtime, but this is just plain greedy.
299	00:25:40	00:25:43	My knees can't take this anymore.
300	00:25:43	00:25:44	Have you eaten anything?
301	00:25:45	00:25:46	What did you bring?
302	00:25:47	00:25:49	I'll see what's in the fridge.
303	00:25:52	00:25:55	We have to replace that, you know.
304	00:26:28	00:26:30	Hey... black lung.
305	00:26:30	00:26:31	Ha, ha.
306	00:26:31	00:26:34	I've been sifting through this trash for about six hours.
307	00:26:34	00:26:37	You coming to rescue me or make fun of me?
308	00:26:37	00:26:39	I am just looking. Relax.
309	00:26:39	00:26:41	What are these white fibers here?
310	00:26:41	00:26:45	They must be from the spare bedroom because all the other carpets are green.
311	00:26:45	00:26:49	Spare bedroom wasn't on his entrance or exit path.
312	00:26:49	00:26:54	Look, all I know is that they were near the top of the bag, so it must have been one of the last things he vacuumed.
313	00:26:56	00:27:01	I did happen to find this butterfly pendant, with some white fibers on it.
314	00:27:01	00:27:09	It looks like it's from a necklace or a bracelet and it has this link that snaps, so I'm thinking... sign of struggle?
315	00:27:09	00:27:12	The killer was in that spare bedroom.
316	00:27:20	00:27:22	Feel better?
317	00:27:24	00:27:29	Well, now that we fed you, we should probably talk about a shower.
318	00:27:30	00:27:32	I mean at your place.
319	00:27:32	00:27:33	You need to go home.
320	00:27:33	00:27:36	As soon as we find some evidence, I promise.
321	00:27:36	00:27:38	With fresh eyes, you won't miss it.
322	00:27:42	00:27:44	Just talk it through with me, will you?
323	00:27:44	00:27:45	What do we know?
324	00:27:45	00:27:48	All right.
325	00:27:48	00:28:02	The bathroom is where things got started-- candles, oils, steam shower, cleaned up, oiled up, sexed up.
326	00:28:02	00:28:04	Let's go back to the bedroom.
327	00:28:10	00:28:12	No, nothing on this sheet.
328	00:28:25	00:28:29	She changed her sheets for her date-- I would.
329	00:28:35	00:28:37	Hey, Cath?
330	00:28:39	00:28:42	Got silk?
331	00:28:48	00:28:51	Why, yes, I do.
332	00:28:55	00:28:57	I don't mean to embarrass you, but, um...
333	00:28:59	00:29:01	...some guys need leverage.
334	00:29:03	00:29:05	They do?
335	00:29:05	00:29:06	I'll dust for prints.
336	00:29:11	00:29:14	Grissom.
337	00:29:14	00:29:17	Hey, Warrick.
338	00:29:18	00:29:20	Butterfly? Where?
339	00:29:22	00:29:24	I haven't checked the spare bedroom.
340	00:29:24	00:29:26	I'll call you back.
341	00:30:32	00:30:34	Hang one.
342	00:30:34	00:30:35	Toe print.
343	00:30:35	00:30:38	I'll have Sara compare it against both victims.
344	00:30:38	00:30:39	Good.
345	00:30:39	00:30:43	Warrick found a butterfly charm in the vacuum bag.
346	00:30:44	00:30:47	I think I just found a piece from the same chain in this box.
347	00:30:48	00:30:50	Butterfly, huh?
348	00:30:50	00:30:52	She had a collection.
349	00:30:52	00:30:56	Gifts from her... gentlemen callers?
350	00:30:56	00:31:00	Maybe the killer was taking his gift back, as in leave no trace.
351	00:31:00	00:31:05	Maybe he finally ran out of patience and got sloppy.
352	00:31:21	00:31:23	And this is why I didn't leave.
353	00:32:27	00:32:28	Hey, you seen Grissom?
354	00:32:28	00:32:30	He's still at the crime scene.
355	00:32:30	00:32:34	I eliminated both victims from the print you pulled off the bed.
356	00:32:34	00:32:37	Well, we know she was fishing off the company pier.
357	00:32:39	00:32:40	You, uh, seen Debbie?
358	00:32:41	00:32:42	Yeah.
359	00:32:42	00:32:43	And?
360	00:32:43	00:32:46	Yeah, I compared her toe prints.
361	00:32:46	00:32:48	If I didn't know better I'd think that was you on that table.
362	00:32:49	00:32:51	I didn't really look at her face.
363	00:32:54	00:32:56	When you see Grissom, will you tell him?
364	00:33:02	00:33:03	Oh, that feels nice.
365	00:33:03	00:33:05	Do you have something to take this off?
366	00:33:05	00:33:06	Just step on the card, please.
367	00:33:07	00:33:09	Good thing you caught me early in the shift.
368	00:33:09	00:33:11	Yeah, lucky for me.
369	00:33:11	00:33:14	I think I could probably tell who pulled a double.
370	00:33:14	00:33:16	Listen, I've got a patient waiting in pre-op.
371	00:33:17	00:33:18	We'll have you out in a minute.
372	00:33:18	00:33:22	We appreciate you providing your prints voluntarily.
373	00:33:25	00:33:28	Well, there's probably a little bit of a lot of us in Debbie's house.
374	00:33:28	00:33:31	Oh, we'll know soon enough.
375	00:33:33	00:33:34	Thank you.
376	00:33:34	00:33:36	You understand, right?
377	00:33:36	00:33:38	The police aren't the only ones with a code of honor.
378	00:33:38	00:33:43	Now, some of these men are married, and if this gets out...
379	00:33:43	00:33:46	Nothing gets out unless it needs to get out.
380	00:33:46	00:33:48	Got a match.
381	00:33:52	00:33:54	Dr. Tripton.
382	00:33:54	00:33:59	I'm afraid your patient in pre-op is going to have to wait a little while longer.
383	00:34:07	00:34:09	Don't really know why I'm here.
384	00:34:09	00:34:12	Your toe print was found in Debbie Marlin's house.
385	00:34:12	00:34:16	Same house she was murdered in.
386	00:34:16	00:34:21	Her car was in the shop, and I gave her a ride home one night, and she invited me in for a cup of coffee.
387	00:34:21	00:34:24	She didn't like anyone wearing shoes in the house.
388	00:34:25	00:34:26	Some Feng Shui thing.
389	00:34:26	00:34:29	So, you Feng Shuied your way to the bed?
390	00:34:30	00:34:32	She was provocative.
391	00:34:32	00:34:36	You take your coat off, she has her clothes off.
392	00:34:37	00:34:39	She came on to me.
393	00:34:39	00:34:42	Come on, Doc, let's do it.
394	00:34:45	00:34:47	Take a look.
395	00:34:53	00:34:56	All right, well, let's talk about what's not open to interpretation.
396	00:34:56	00:34:59	Yours were the only prints found in the house.
397	00:34:59	00:35:04	Michael Clark was on your rotation-- he was on your surgical team the day he was killed.
398	00:35:04	00:35:07	You called in sick. Surgery was canceled.
399	00:35:07	00:35:11	Freed him up to be with Debbie, who also had the day off. What luck.
400	00:35:11	00:35:13	My son had a ball game.
401	00:35:13	00:35:14	My daughter was at a swim meet.
402	00:35:14	00:35:17	My wife was at a conference, and the surgery was elective.
403	00:35:17	00:35:19	Not a stretch.
404	00:35:19	00:35:20	Your wife know about you and Debbie?
405	00:35:20	00:35:22	No.
406	00:35:22	00:35:23	She asked for sex, right?
407	00:35:23	00:35:25	She also asked for the bracelet, too, huh?
408	00:35:27	00:35:30	No, but... I gave it to her.
409	00:35:30	00:35:32	This one.
410	00:35:32	00:35:34	She loved butterflies.
411	00:35:34	00:35:39	Uh, I figured if I gave something special to her, she'd give something special to me.
412	00:35:40	00:35:41	Hmm.
413	00:35:42	00:35:43	So it was a long-term relationship?
414	00:35:47	00:35:50	That's the spare bedroom hair.
415	00:35:52	00:35:55	There's an oily film on the surface of the hair.
416	00:35:55	00:35:56	Propylene glycol.
417	00:35:57	00:36:00	Active ingredient in Rogaine for male pattern baldness.
418	00:36:00	00:36:06	Personally, I don't use the stuff, but my grandfather, Papa Olaf-- he was Bruce Willis at age 16.
419	00:36:07	00:36:12	Lucky for me, baldness comes from the mother's side, so I'm safe... Greg, please, I'm very tired.
420	00:36:12	00:36:15	Well, maybe the guy we're looking for is going bald...
421	00:36:15	00:36:16	or trying not to.
422	00:36:16	00:36:22	According to Papa Olaf, a lot of guys who use Rogaine also use Propecia, kind of like a cocktail.
423	00:36:22	00:36:23	I ran the hair through MassSpec.
424	00:36:24	00:36:30	ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, minoxidil, and finasteride.
425	00:36:30	00:36:34	Finasteride, the chemical name for Propecia.
426	00:36:34	00:36:37	But wait, there's more, and it's a family secret.
427	00:36:37	00:36:40	Sexual. Happens in less than two percent of users.
428	00:36:40	00:36:43	Papa Olaf was one of those guys that needed hydraulics.
429	00:36:51	00:36:53	Oh.
430	00:36:53	00:36:55	The prodigal CSI returns.
431	00:36:55	00:36:56	You get any sleep?
432	00:36:56	00:36:58	Not yet.
433	00:36:59	00:37:01	So, uh, Brass had to let Dr. Tripton go.
434	00:37:01	00:37:02	The old sex alibi.
435	00:37:03	00:37:06	Too bad he didn't leave a toe print on a scalpel blade.
436	00:37:06	00:37:07	You got a take on him?
437	00:37:07	00:37:11	Balloon head, but credible... like most adulterers.
438	00:37:11	00:37:12	Is he going bald?
439	00:37:12	00:37:13	Not really.
440	00:37:13	00:37:15	Grey hair?
441	00:37:15	00:37:17	No.
442	00:37:17	00:37:19	Anything else?
443	00:37:19	00:37:21	He's a lefty.
444	00:37:21	00:37:23	Okay, keep in mind, this is just a theory.
445	00:37:23	00:37:27	It's a hot button issue among forensic pathologists.
446	00:37:27	00:37:34	What's the consensus? Most doctors say it's impossible to prove handedness based on the wounds inflicted on a victim.
447	00:37:34	00:37:36	Forget hard science. What's your hypothesis?
448	00:37:36	00:37:42	Based on micro-incisions and hesitation marks, the victim was lying face up when he was killed.
449	00:37:42	00:37:46	Take a look at the right knee.
450	00:37:46	00:37:53	The cut on the cartilage of the right distal femur has slight angulations from the, uh...
451	00:37:53	00:37:57	left distal to the right proximal, which suggests the killer was left-handed.
452	00:37:57	00:38:05	This angulation is consistent with cuts made to the acetabulum and to the wrist, but bear in mind, it's not going to be admissible in court.
453	00:38:05	00:38:08	I don't care about court.
454	00:38:08	00:38:14	My mind's on a left-handed, Propecia-using surgeon who's probably on staff at Desert Palm.
455	00:38:46	00:38:48	There was no need for the light show.
456	00:38:48	00:38:50	All you had to do was ask.
457	00:38:50	00:38:52	Good.
458	00:38:52	00:38:54	Since we're being completely honest...
459	00:38:54	00:38:56	are you losing your hair?
460	00:38:56	00:38:59	I'm a 48-year-old man. I'm not unique.
461	00:39:00	00:39:01	Your hair is, though.
462	00:39:02	00:39:05	We found it at the crime scene.
463	00:39:05	00:39:08	Minoxidil absorbs infrared light.
464	00:39:10	00:39:13	I-I take Rogaine and Propecia.
465	00:39:13	00:39:26	Again, not unique. Well, we think that Debbie Marlin and Michael Clark were killed by a surgeon who is left-handed, Dr. Tripton, who has an alibi, and you.
466	00:39:26	00:39:31	Well, if you're going to make accusations, you should really do your homework.
467	00:39:31	00:39:34	Howard and I are the only lefties on staff.
468	00:39:34	00:39:37	Dr. Randolph, who has privileges at the hospital, he's also a lefty.
469	00:39:37	00:39:39	We play tennis every Wednesday.
470	00:39:39	00:39:41	He's got a heck of a back-hand.
471	00:39:42	00:39:48	If you want me to name more names, I could, but you don't want me to do your job for you, do you?
472	00:39:48	00:39:49	Gentlemen...
473	00:39:49	00:39:57	we're here as a courtesy, so if you're quite through wasting our time, I think that the doctor would like to get back to the business of saving lives.
474	00:39:57	00:39:58	Not so fast.
475	00:39:58	00:40:02	Is this a link from a bracelet you gave Debbie?
476	00:40:04	00:40:06	Mm-hmm. It looks like it.
477	00:40:06	00:40:08	Where's the rest of it?
478	00:40:08	00:40:11	This link was vacuumed from the floor of the spare bedroom after the murder.
479	00:40:11	00:40:12	The other link was in her jewelry box.
480	00:40:12	00:40:19	The funny thing is that all the bracelets from the other guys she slept with are intact.
481	00:40:19	00:40:25	Well, all I can tell you is when I gave it to her, it was in one piece.
482	00:40:33	00:40:35	Do you have any other evidence?
483	00:40:36	00:40:39	No, we don't.
484	00:40:39	00:40:42	We might not have any other evidence, but we have a theory.
485	00:40:42	00:40:44	That's not admissible in court.
486	00:40:44	00:40:46	Oh, no, no, it's worth a listen.
487	00:40:51	00:40:57	We think you killed Debbie Marlin because she rejected you, and Michael Clark paid the price.
488	00:41:02	00:41:09	Thank you for your time and your theories, you don't have a case.
489	00:41:09	00:41:11	Doctor.
490	00:41:16	00:41:18	It's sad, isn't it, Doc?
491	00:41:19	00:41:21	Guys like us.
492	00:41:23	00:41:27	Couple of middle-aged men who've allowed their work to consume their lives.
493	00:41:29	00:41:34	The only time we ever touch other people is when we're wearing our latex gloves.
494	00:41:36	00:41:41	We wake up one day and realize that for 50 years we haven't really lived at all.
495	00:41:43	00:41:47	But then, all of a sudden...
496	00:41:47	00:41:49	we get a second chance.
497	00:41:52	00:41:54	Somebody young and beautiful shows up.
498	00:41:54	00:41:55	Somebody...
499	00:41:55	00:41:58	we could care about.
500	00:41:58	00:42:01	She offers us a new life with her...
501	00:42:03	00:42:06	...but we have a big decision to make, right?
502	00:42:06	00:42:11	Because we have to risk everything we've worked for in order to have her.
503	00:42:15	00:42:19	I couldn't do it...
504	00:42:19	00:42:21	but you did.
505	00:42:23	00:42:26	You risked it all...
506	00:42:26	00:42:30	and she showed you a wonderful life, didn't she?
507	00:42:34	00:42:40	But then she took it away and gave it to somebody else, and you were lost.
508	00:42:43	00:42:45	So you took her life.
509	00:42:51	00:42:54	Debbie, it's me, Michael.
510	00:42:58	00:43:03	You killed them both, and now you have nothing.
511	00:43:05	00:43:07	I'm still here.
512	00:43:08	00:43:10	Are you?
