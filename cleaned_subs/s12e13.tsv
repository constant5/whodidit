0	00:00:10	00:00:14	I've never seen so much money spent on so little actual fabric.
1	00:00:14	00:00:17	Well, you're always saying it's what's inside that counts, right?
2	00:00:17	00:00:18	Yeah.
3	00:00:18	00:00:20	Look where that gets me.
4	00:00:20	00:00:23	Look, well, maybe you should try wearing something less granny than the flannel PJ's.
5	00:00:23	00:00:25	Hey, they keep me warm!
6	00:00:25	00:00:27	You know what else can keep you warm? Yeah, coffee.
7	00:00:27	00:00:31	(laughs) There's a place on the third floor. I'll pay.
8	00:00:31	00:00:32	Oh, man, I just can't decide...
9	00:00:32	00:00:36	No, I mean, if you just wait two weeks, you can get it online for, like, half the price.
10	00:00:36	00:00:38	Yeah, but you're missing the point-- I want it now.
11	00:00:38	00:00:40	Fine. So pay the money.
12	00:00:40	00:00:42	No. You're right. I'll wait.
13	00:00:42	00:00:44	You're always right.
14	00:00:44	00:00:47	So we'll go get coffee, and then we'll go back and get it.
15	00:01:08	00:01:11	Aw...
16	00:01:13	00:01:16	So cute. (giggles)
17	00:01:46	00:01:48	00.
18	00:01:48	00:01:49	Do you think we'll make it?
19	00:01:49	00:01:51	00.
20	00:01:53	00:01:54	Eva, your hair...
21	00:01:54	00:01:57	What? There's a huge piece missing out of the middle of your hair!
22	00:01:57	00:01:59	What?! What?! Somebody's cut it.
23	00:01:59	00:02:00	I have no idea.
24	00:02:00	00:02:02	Would you...? Where? Where?
25	00:02:02	00:02:03	How much is it?
26	00:02:03	00:02:05	How much is it? I don't know. I don't know.
27	00:02:05	00:02:06	How much is taken off?
28	00:02:06	00:02:08	I feel so violated.
29	00:02:09	00:02:11	I would, too.
30	00:02:11	00:02:13	I mean, it's sick.
31	00:02:13	00:02:15	Isn't it?
32	00:02:15	00:02:17	Yeah.
33	00:02:17	00:02:18	Four days ago, a girl in a mall.
34	00:02:18	00:02:20	Now, this girl, in a movie theater.
35	00:02:20	00:02:21	That makes 11.
36	00:02:21	00:02:23	At least that have reported it.
37	00:02:23	00:02:24	I'm sure there's more.
38	00:02:24	00:02:28	The sheriff is pissed; bad for the tourist trade.
39	00:02:28	00:02:32	It's the same story-- chunk of hair cut off in a public place.
40	00:02:32	00:02:33	They never even feel it.
41	00:02:33	00:02:34	Any of the women see anything?
42	00:02:34	00:02:35	So far, no.
43	00:02:35	00:02:37	Guy's a ghost.
44	00:02:37	00:02:40	Yeah. Well, at least I have nothing to worry about.
45	00:02:40	00:02:42	Yeah.
46	00:02:42	00:02:43	The whole thing is creepy.
47	00:02:48	00:02:50	Ms. Bingham, this is CSI Russell.
48	00:02:50	00:02:52	Thanks for coming in.
49	00:02:53	00:02:56	This shouldn't take too much longer, right?
50	00:02:56	00:03:01	I'm just gonna run a comb through a couple of times, look for some loose-cut hairs.
51	00:03:01	00:03:03	It could help us out a lot. So...
52	00:03:03	00:03:05	you were sitting in a movie theater.
53	00:03:05	00:03:07	That's right.
54	00:03:07	00:03:09	Wow. I haven't been to the movies for so long.
55	00:03:09	00:03:11	Which one was it?
56	00:03:11	00:03:12	Excuse me?
57	00:03:12	00:03:14	You a Matt Damon fan? (laughs softly)
58	00:03:14	00:03:16	Uh...
59	00:03:16	00:03:18	I'm a... Daniel Craig girl.
60	00:03:18	00:03:19	Me, too.
61	00:03:19	00:03:22	The, uh, tuxedo and the gun, right?
62	00:03:22	00:03:23	Hard to beat.
63	00:03:23	00:03:26	So, Paula, you want to tell me what happened?
64	00:03:26	00:03:32	I-I didn't... I didn't realize it until I got home, so he must have cut it during the movie.
65	00:03:32	00:03:33	But I don't get it. Why my hair?
66	00:03:33	00:03:36	Honestly, I have no idea.
67	00:03:36	00:03:37	You do have great hair.
68	00:03:37	00:03:38	Well, there is that.
69	00:03:38	00:03:40	You didn't get a look at the guy?
70	00:03:40	00:03:42	No. Just...
71	00:03:42	00:03:44	Daniel Craig.
72	00:03:45	00:03:46	I'm all done.
73	00:03:46	00:03:48	Yeah, I just have one more question.
74	00:03:48	00:03:50	Anything else strange happen lately?
75	00:03:50	00:03:51	You know, purse stolen?
76	00:03:51	00:03:53	Missing keys? Tires slashed?
77	00:03:53	00:03:55	No. Okay.
78	00:03:55	00:03:57	Good, good.
79	00:03:57	00:03:58	Well, I am glad to hear that.
80	00:03:58	00:04:06	Okay. Uh, bottom line, some creep took your hair-- don't let him mess with your head.
81	00:04:07	00:04:08	Thanks. I'll see you out.
82	00:04:10	00:04:11	Hold on a second.
83	00:04:11	00:04:14	Let me give you... let me give you one of these.
84	00:04:14	00:04:15	Call me...
85	00:04:15	00:04:17	if you, if you need anything.
86	00:04:17	00:04:18	Thanks.
87	00:04:18	00:04:19	Yeah.
88	00:04:21	00:04:23	Well...
89	00:04:23	00:04:25	looks like she feels better.
90	00:04:25	00:04:27	And based on your performance in there, so do I.
91	00:04:29	00:04:33	Yeah, I just hope this little fetish doesn't turn into something more.
92	00:04:36	00:04:38	You should start playing the ponies.
93	00:05:06	00:05:08	The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.
94	00:05:09	00:05:12	A little mood music, I guess.
95	00:05:12	00:05:14	Hell of a mood to set.
96	00:05:18	00:05:21	Eva Byron.
97	00:05:21	00:05:25	Four days ago, she and her sister filed a police report.
98	00:05:25	00:05:28	Our hair freak took a souvenir at the mall.
99	00:05:28	00:05:29	I guess it wasn't enough.
100	00:05:29	00:05:31	Not anymore.
101	00:05:31	00:05:33	He made her a blonde.
102	00:05:43	00:05:45	He took her eyes.
103	00:05:45	00:05:47	That sick bastard.
104	00:05:47	00:05:48	Why?
105	00:05:48	00:05:50	Hell with why.
106	00:05:50	00:05:51	I want to know who.
107	00:06:44	00:06:47	Guy gave her a pretty freaky makeover.
108	00:06:47	00:06:51	00 p.m.
109	00:06:51	00:06:53	Cause of death?
110	00:06:53	00:06:56	Other than her eyes, there's no apparent wound or trauma.
111	00:06:56	00:06:58	You'll have to wait till autopsy.
112	00:06:58	00:07:00	He blinded her.
113	00:07:00	00:07:02	What do you think?
114	00:07:02	00:07:04	Killer didn't want her to see him.
115	00:07:04	00:07:06	There's something in her mouth.
116	00:07:06	00:07:08	Please don't be her eyes.
117	00:07:16	00:07:18	Oh, that's nasty.
118	00:07:21	00:07:23	Hair braid.
119	00:07:23	00:07:25	Shoved down her throat.
120	00:07:25	00:07:27	Could be our C.O.D.
121	00:07:27	00:07:29	Definitely a calling card.
122	00:07:44	00:07:46	Have you talked to Catherine?
123	00:07:46	00:07:49	Yeah. Yeah, have you?
124	00:07:49	00:07:51	Yeah.
125	00:07:51	00:07:53	She, uh, sounded good.
126	00:07:53	00:07:55	Yeah.
127	00:07:55	00:07:57	She'll show those FBI boys how to fly straight, huh?
128	00:07:57	00:07:59	She did it for me.
129	00:07:59	00:08:01	She did it for all of us.
130	00:08:01	00:08:03	Well, Quantico isn't that far, right?
131	00:08:05	00:08:07	No, not really.
132	00:08:11	00:08:14	Well, that can't be good.
133	00:08:14	00:08:18	So, our hair fetish freak is now a homicidal maniac.
134	00:08:18	00:08:19	Eh, that's just great.
135	00:08:19	00:08:21	What do we know?
136	00:08:21	00:08:24	11 women have come forward to report they were snipped by this guy.
137	00:08:24	00:08:26	Including the dead girl? Yeah.
138	00:08:26	00:08:28	I got my guys doing welfare checks on the other ten.
139	00:08:28	00:08:31	But we need to assume that there are more women out there that didn't report it.
140	00:08:31	00:08:34	Well, let's hope they're just shy, not dead, too.
141	00:08:34	00:08:37	Well, best way to know that is to reach out to the press.
142	00:08:37	00:08:40	And create a panic? In my city?
143	00:08:40	00:08:42	I got enough problems.
144	00:08:42	00:08:44	This one, you need to solve.
145	00:08:48	00:08:52	I think she was looking at you when she said that.
146	00:08:52	00:08:54	Yeah, right.
147	00:09:03	00:09:06	Chain is busted, but the lock is intact.
148	00:09:06	00:09:09	She trusted him enough to open the door to him.
149	00:09:19	00:09:22	Never had a chance to realize her mistake.
150	00:09:25	00:09:30	Looks like this is where he did his extreme makeover, psychopath edition.
151	00:09:33	00:09:36	Blow-dryer and curling iron are still plugged in.
152	00:09:36	00:09:39	Traces of makeup and hair dye in the sink.
153	00:09:39	00:09:41	So he snipped Eva's hair at the mall.
154	00:09:41	00:09:43	Obviously, he was attracted to it for some reason.
155	00:09:43	00:09:45	Certainly not the color.
156	00:09:45	00:09:47	He turned her into a blonde.
157	00:09:47	00:09:48	You should watch yourself.
158	00:09:48	00:09:49	Well, he dyed her hair.
159	00:09:49	00:09:51	You should watch yourself.
160	00:09:51	00:09:52	True.
161	00:09:54	00:09:56	Where is the packaging?
162	00:09:56	00:09:58	You know? The products?
163	00:09:58	00:10:00	Guess he was smart enough to take them with him.
164	00:10:00	00:10:03	Smart enough to wipe down his prints, too.
165	00:10:03	00:10:04	Suggests planning.
166	00:10:04	00:10:07	Guy's not just sick, he's dangerous.
167	00:10:09	00:10:15	When we reported what happened at the mall, the officer said it was just some weirdo, and now my sister...
168	00:10:17	00:10:19	I'm sorry for your loss.
169	00:10:19	00:10:22	It's the same guy, isn't it?
170	00:10:24	00:10:25	You people should have warned us.
171	00:10:25	00:10:29	Listen, if I could bring your sister back, I would.
172	00:10:29	00:10:35	But I need your help right now, so we can keep this from happening to someone else, okay?
173	00:10:37	00:10:38	Yeah.
174	00:10:38	00:10:43	Now, after the mall incident, did your sister receive any strange phone calls?
175	00:10:43	00:10:45	Did she think somebody was following her?
176	00:10:45	00:10:47	Anything like that? No.
177	00:10:48	00:10:50	Do you recognize this dress?
178	00:10:52	00:10:54	Those sunglasses?
179	00:10:54	00:10:55	No. Why?
180	00:10:55	00:10:58	Your sister was wearing them when we found her.
181	00:10:58	00:11:00	Those aren't hers.
182	00:11:00	00:11:01	You sure? I know Eva's style.
183	00:11:01	00:11:03	She hated retro.
184	00:11:03	00:11:05	Even as a kid, she refused to wear hand-me-downs.
185	00:11:07	00:11:09	He dressed her up?!
186	00:11:10	00:11:12	What else did he do to her?
187	00:11:12	00:11:21	I found no sign of sexual assault, and besides the facial lacerations caused by the door, there were no other apparent injuries perimortem.
188	00:11:21	00:11:24	So the eyes were gouged out postmortem?
189	00:11:24	00:11:28	Tissue is withdrawn, nonresponsive.
190	00:11:28	00:11:29	Cause of death?
191	00:11:29	00:11:32	Well, it wasn't the braid in her throat.
192	00:11:32	00:11:34	She died of a morphine overdose.
193	00:11:34	00:11:37	The killer injected her in the carotid artery.
194	00:11:37	00:11:40	Death was relatively quick.
195	00:11:40	00:11:43	Boy, I didn't see that one coming.
196	00:11:43	00:11:52	Okay, so our guy forces his way in, kills her, then he has his fun-- eyes, makeover, braid down the throat.
197	00:11:52	00:11:55	And that wasn't the only hair he left behind.
198	00:11:55	00:12:00	The killer used hair extensions to repair the area he'd cut off in the elevator.
199	00:12:00	00:12:04	Not quite the same shade as the dye job.
200	00:12:04	00:12:06	So what do you think it all means?
201	00:12:06	00:12:09	He breaks her so he can fix her?
202	00:13:07	00:13:13	You ever see that Japanese movie The Ring about that creepy girl who lives in a well and vomits hair?
203	00:13:13	00:13:16	I thought the only Japanese culture that you knew about was octopus porn.
204	00:13:16	00:13:19	You should be nicer to me.
205	00:13:19	00:13:20	Why?
206	00:13:20	00:13:21	I'll tell you.
207	00:13:22	00:13:27	The braid you fished out of your victim I sorted and meticulously measured.
208	00:13:27	00:13:34	Henry ran mitochondrial DNA, and it turns out that the hairs in the braid are from 26 different women.
209	00:13:34	00:13:35	Twenty-six?
210	00:13:35	00:13:39	Including the 11 who reported having their locks snipped by our hair stalker.
211	00:13:39	00:13:42	I know what you're thinking-- holy hairball.
212	00:13:42	00:13:44	That's not what I'm thinking.
213	00:13:44	00:13:46	What I'm thinking is, this braid may be more than a calling card.
214	00:13:46	00:13:48	Like a list of future victims?
215	00:13:48	00:13:49	If you're braided, you're branded.
216	00:13:49	00:13:50	Mm.
217	00:13:50	00:13:52	Still doesn't tell us who's next.
218	00:13:52	00:13:54	So what do we do?
219	00:13:54	00:13:58	Follow up with the list of names we do know and see if anyone's noticed someone looking over their shoulder.
220	00:14:05	00:14:07	Don't need to be a profiler to see it.
221	00:14:07	00:14:11	Slender, 20s, long hair...
222	00:14:11	00:14:14	and these are just the ones we know about.
223	00:14:19	00:14:21	How are we supposed to protect these girls?
224	00:14:21	00:14:25	Well, we can't put a car 24-7 in front of every house.
225	00:14:25	00:14:26	You just need to catch this guy.
226	00:14:26	00:14:30	Any no-shows among the women who came forward?
227	00:14:30	00:14:31	Joyce Debernardi.
228	00:14:31	00:14:33	Henderson address.
229	00:14:33	00:14:35	I left a, a message on her cell.
230	00:14:38	00:14:39	Brass.
231	00:14:39	00:14:42	He was checking up on her.
232	00:14:42	00:14:43	Hey, Jim.
233	00:14:47	00:14:50	Joyce Debernardi just showed up.
234	00:15:01	00:15:03	Day shift got the call.
235	00:15:03	00:15:06	Similar crime scene, same M.O.
236	00:15:06	00:15:08	She was found just like this?
237	00:15:08	00:15:11	Déjà vu all over again.
238	00:15:13	00:15:15	Not quite.
239	00:15:15	00:15:19	Eva's eyes were gouged out.
240	00:15:19	00:15:20	This is different.
241	00:15:20	00:15:23	Proteins in the cornea are coagulated.
242	00:15:23	00:15:26	Bastard used ammonia to blind her.
243	00:15:35	00:15:40	They, uh, found vomit in close proximity to the body.
244	00:15:40	00:15:41	Reaction to the chemical.
245	00:15:41	00:15:43	Unlike Eva, she was alive when he did this.
246	00:15:43	00:15:44	Alive but helpless.
247	00:15:44	00:15:48	They also found partially digested pills-- Succinylcholine in vomitus.
248	00:15:48	00:15:51	That's a paralytic.
249	00:15:51	00:15:52	That's how he's getting better at the makeup.
250	00:15:59	00:16:01	He's taking his time, he's savoring it.
251	00:16:01	00:16:03	He's getting more confident.
252	00:16:03	00:16:06	Which means he's getting harder to catch.
253	00:16:22	00:16:24	Help...
254	00:16:48	00:16:56	Two women-- both have their hair cut by this nut-job, now they're dead, dressed up like some '70s fantasy.
255	00:16:56	00:16:59	When did we get the first report of this guy cutting hair?
256	00:17:00	00:17:01	Three weeks ago, Sheriff.
257	00:17:01	00:17:02	Three weeks?
258	00:17:02	00:17:04	Clearly he didn't just step over the line.
259	00:17:04	00:17:06	This guy's escalating. Fast.
260	00:17:06	00:17:07	What are you two doing about it?
261	00:17:07	00:17:10	Well, right now, we're listening 'cause he's, he's talking to us.
262	00:17:10	00:17:12	He's sending letters now, what?
263	00:17:12	00:17:17	No, these... found in the throats of our two victims.
264	00:17:17	00:17:22	That braid has hair from 26 different women, including our two murdered ones.
265	00:17:22	00:17:24	He's given us a list of who he's going after.
266	00:17:24	00:17:30	11 of the names we know, 15 we don't-- women whose hair has been cut but they never came forward to report it.
267	00:17:30	00:17:34	All of these women are in danger and they all deserve to know it.
268	00:17:36	00:17:38	I came here to be briefed, not told what to do.
269	00:17:38	00:17:41	I understand, but I think we need to go to the press.
270	00:17:41	00:17:46	You know, any panic this may cause-- it's worth it if we can save just, just one life.
271	00:17:48	00:17:50	I'll talk to the mayor.
272	00:17:50	00:17:51	Thank you.
273	00:17:51	00:17:52	That's my job.
274	00:17:52	00:17:54	Do yours.
275	00:17:55	00:18:03	Dresses our victims were found in are both vintage, no retro imitations, the real deal, circa 1978.
276	00:18:03	00:18:05	(snickers) What?
277	00:18:05	00:18:07	I... I can't talk to you behind that dress, man.
278	00:18:07	00:18:09	Looks like you're wearing that thing.
279	00:18:09	00:18:10	Oh. (chuckles)
280	00:18:10	00:18:13	So, '70s, huh, you sure about that?
281	00:18:13	00:18:14	Yeah, I spoke with an expert.
282	00:18:14	00:18:15	Oh, yeah, who's that?
283	00:18:15	00:18:17	My mother. Mm.
284	00:18:17	00:18:18	She's a bit of a clotheshorse.
285	00:18:18	00:18:20	Still has the figure for it, though.
286	00:18:20	00:18:21	I'll take your word for that.
287	00:18:21	00:18:30	Well, anyway, uh, hand- stitching on the sleeve, original label, real silk, all beautifully preserved, thanks to dichlorobenzene.
288	00:18:30	00:18:31	You mean mothballs.
289	00:18:31	00:18:32	Exactly.
290	00:18:32	00:18:35	So I doubt that the killer found these on a rack in a thrift store.
291	00:18:35	00:18:39	No, he probably had 'em in storage, then pulled 'em out and put 'em on our victims.
292	00:18:39	00:18:41	Perhaps these dresses belong to somebody he knows.
293	00:18:41	00:18:44	Yeah, it's starting to add up now.
294	00:18:44	00:18:49	Maybe it wasn't somebody he knows but someone he was trying to turn these women into.
295	00:18:49	00:18:54	The mayor and I wish to assure the city that we are doing all we can to bring this perpetrator to justice.
296	00:18:54	00:19:09	As a woman, parent, I understand your fears, and I appeal to anyone who may have been a victim of the Shear Stalker or who may have any information regarding his identity, to please call 911.
297	00:19:09	00:19:12	Shear Stalker-- wow, they already have a name.
298	00:19:12	00:19:15	You got the sheriff to go public.
299	00:19:15	00:19:17	Very impressive.
300	00:19:17	00:19:19	I appealed to her sense of civic duty.
301	00:19:19	00:19:20	And her fear of voters?
302	00:19:22	00:19:25	There's a lot riding on this.
303	00:19:25	00:19:27	We'll catch him.
304	00:19:28	00:19:32	Hodges, um, told me about the dresses.
305	00:19:32	00:19:37	I mean, we may not be getting a picture of our killer, but maybe we have a picture of his obsession.
306	00:19:37	00:19:39	Blonde, size-six.
307	00:19:39	00:19:42	If she were in her 20s in the 1970s, she'd be 60-something now.
308	00:19:42	00:19:49	What do you think this guy's deal is-- fear of women, something deeper, maybe Mommy never loved me?
309	00:19:49	00:19:54	Personally, I always tend to go to my Psycho place when killers start playing dress-up.
310	00:19:54	00:20:02	I always go to my Ted Bundy place-- predator, narcissistic, dissociative identity disorder, woman hater.
311	00:20:02	00:20:03	I'm not so sure.
312	00:20:03	00:20:06	Tox came back on our second victim-- same as the first.
313	00:20:06	00:20:07	C.O.D.-- morphine overdose.
314	00:20:07	00:20:09	I mean, tha-that's oddly gentle.
315	00:20:09	00:20:11	He's putting them to sleep, you know?
316	00:20:11	00:20:15	Plus, all the care he's taking to, to remake them, to redress them.
317	00:20:15	00:20:17	Where are you going with this?
318	00:20:17	00:20:20	You know, put it all together, maybe it doesn't spell hate.
319	00:20:20	00:20:21	Maybe it spells love.
320	00:20:21	00:20:23	Love?! Really!
321	00:20:25	00:20:27	Well, he's still gouging their eyes out.
322	00:20:30	00:20:31	That's true.
323	00:20:34	00:20:37	These are the hair extensions Doc Robbins found on our victims.
324	00:20:37	00:20:38	The hair...
325	00:20:38	00:20:40	all came from one person.
326	00:20:40	00:20:42	I compared it to the 26 other hairs we found in the braids.
327	00:20:42	00:20:43	Guess what?
328	00:20:43	00:20:44	No match on any of them.
329	00:20:44	00:20:49	So, if the braid is a to-do list, then this person is not a target.
330	00:20:49	00:20:51	Henry run DNA?
331	00:20:51	00:20:53	Yep, hair and dress match.
332	00:20:53	00:20:56	Okay, killer definitely had access to clothes and hair from the same person.
333	00:20:56	00:21:02	The person he's making our victims into, and I'm assuming that this mystery woman is not in CODIS.
334	00:21:02	00:21:05	No, so I ran isotope ratios on the hair.
335	00:21:05	00:21:11	I can't give you an exact timeline, but it looks like our mystery woman has been doing some traveling-- Japan, Germany, Southern Nevada.
336	00:21:11	00:21:13	She gets around.
337	00:21:13	00:21:14	And not for pleasure.
338	00:21:14	00:21:15	I also ran tox.
339	00:21:15	00:21:21	Every time she traveled, readings would spike in alkylatic antineoplastic agents and antimetabolites.
340	00:21:21	00:21:27	Cancer meds. Turns out Hamburg, Tokyo, and Las Vegas all have hospitals that specialize in rare cancers.
341	00:21:27	00:21:29	Which hospital in Vegas?
342	00:21:30	00:21:32	Dr. Bill Ryan?
343	00:21:32	00:21:33	That's right.
344	00:21:33	00:21:35	Hi. Uh, CSI Sidle.
345	00:21:35	00:21:36	This is CSI Brody.
346	00:21:36	00:21:37	From the crime lab-- we called.
347	00:21:37	00:21:39	How can I help you?
348	00:21:39	00:21:42	We are looking for a patient who is-- was under your care.
349	00:21:42	00:21:45	We know that the, uh, patient is female.
350	00:21:45	00:21:48	She was treated previously at clinics in Tokyo and Hamburg.
351	00:21:51	00:21:54	You know who we're talking about?
352	00:21:54	00:21:59	I'm sorry, even if I did, doctor-patient confidentiality would preclude me from confirming it.
353	00:21:59	00:22:00	Of course.
354	00:22:00	00:22:02	Have you watched TV lately?
355	00:22:02	00:22:05	The killer who is cutting people's hair?
356	00:22:05	00:22:09	Does this patient you're looking for have something to do with that?
357	00:22:09	00:22:11	She may be our only way to identify that killer.
358	00:22:11	00:22:15	Yeah, doctor, um, Do you have a wife?
359	00:22:15	00:22:16	Daughters, a sister?
360	00:22:16	00:22:20	Women all over this town are absolutely terrified right now.
361	00:22:20	00:22:24	I carry a gun, and you know the first thing I did when I stepped off your elevator?
362	00:22:24	00:22:26	I checked my hair.
363	00:22:26	00:22:28	I looked behind me to make sure nobody was there.
364	00:22:51	00:22:54	Look, I'm going to go grab a coffee.
365	00:22:54	00:22:58	When I get back, I hope that file is still here.
366	00:22:59	00:23:02	Thank you, Doctor.
367	00:23:07	00:23:09	Her name's Lucinda Kemp.
368	00:23:09	00:23:11	Cancer patient, Desert Palm Hospital.
369	00:23:11	00:23:13	She may be our killer's muse.
370	00:23:13	00:23:15	Muse? Muse how?
371	00:23:15	00:23:17	Well, he's dressing the victims up in her clothes.
372	00:23:17	00:23:19	He's making them up to look like her.
373	00:23:19	00:23:21	A younger version of her.
374	00:23:21	00:23:22	Really?
375	00:23:22	00:23:23	A dying cancer patient?
376	00:23:23	00:23:27	That's some theory you got going on there.
377	00:23:27	00:23:30	Well, I'm feeling a hell of a lot better about it right now.
378	00:23:32	00:23:34	What do you think?
379	00:23:34	00:23:37	Two dead young women.
380	00:23:40	00:23:42	And your muse is a dead ringer.
381	00:24:21	00:24:23	Paula?
382	00:24:23	00:24:25	Hey, uh, you said I could call you anytime.
383	00:24:25	00:24:26	Is something the matter?
384	00:24:26	00:24:28	I think somebody was inside my house.
385	00:24:28	00:24:31	The sliding door is open a little, and there's someone banging on my door.
386	00:24:33	00:24:35	Could you have left it open?
387	00:24:35	00:24:37	No... I don't... Maybe?
388	00:24:39	00:24:40	There's somebody knocking at my door.
389	00:24:40	00:24:41	Paula, listen to me.
390	00:24:41	00:24:43	Can you see who it is?
391	00:24:43	00:24:44	Hold on.
392	00:24:49	00:24:51	It's a delivery guy.
393	00:24:51	00:24:52	I'm scared.
394	00:24:52	00:24:54	Do not open the door.
395	00:24:54	00:24:56	Tell him you'll pick up the package later.
396	00:24:56	00:24:59	I'm gonna send a car over to check on you right now.
397	00:24:59	00:25:00	Okay.
398	00:25:00	00:25:02	Everything's gonna be okay.
399	00:25:02	00:25:04	I promise.
400	00:25:04	00:25:05	Thanks.
401	00:25:05	00:25:07	I did a welfare check on Paula Bingham.
402	00:25:07	00:25:09	She's okay; really was a delivery guy.
403	00:25:09	00:25:10	But I can't blame her, though.
404	00:25:10	00:25:12	Everyone's scared.
405	00:25:12	00:25:14	Sooner we catch this guy, the better.
406	00:25:14	00:25:19	I'm just hoping that Norma Desmond can I.D. her secret admirer.
407	00:25:19	00:25:20	Talk to you later.
408	00:25:20	00:25:23	Mrs. Kemp, do you recognize these women?
409	00:25:29	00:25:30	No, I don't think so.
410	00:25:30	00:25:31	Should I?
411	00:25:31	00:25:32	They were murdered.
412	00:25:32	00:25:36	After that, the killer gave them a makeover.
413	00:25:36	00:25:40	Dyed their hair blonde, red lipstick, mascara.
414	00:25:40	00:25:43	That's... horrible.
415	00:25:43	00:25:45	Truly, but...
416	00:25:45	00:25:48	why are you showing them to me?
417	00:25:48	00:25:49	Those are your dresses, right?
418	00:25:49	00:25:51	Well, I mean, they certainly look like my dresses.
419	00:25:51	00:25:52	They're my style.
420	00:25:52	00:25:54	My style never goes out of style.
421	00:25:54	00:25:57	I don't understand why you're showing me these.
422	00:25:57	00:25:58	I don't, either.
423	00:25:58	00:26:01	On the phone, you said you needed me to answer some questions.
424	00:26:01	00:26:05	Now, I come down here, and you're treating me like a common criminal.
425	00:26:05	00:26:06	These two women are dead.
426	00:26:06	00:26:10	And the evidence suggests that you're our only link to our killer. Evidence?
427	00:26:10	00:26:11	What evidence?
428	00:26:11	00:26:17	Well, Adam, the women were staged in dresses that had residual DNA.
429	00:26:17	00:26:22	That DNA matched hair extensions that were attached to the victim's heads.
430	00:26:22	00:26:25	Hair that came from your mother.
431	00:26:25	00:26:26	My hair?
432	00:26:27	00:26:29	No, that's impossible.
433	00:26:29	00:26:33	Well, ma'am, in this day and age, everything's possible. Really, Captain.
434	00:26:33	00:26:34	It's not.
435	00:26:37	00:26:39	No one has taken my hair.
436	00:26:39	00:26:43	Because the cancer already took it.
437	00:26:43	00:26:46	Three months ago, my mother finished her last stage of chemo.
438	00:26:46	00:26:49	You can see the results.
439	00:26:49	00:26:51	I'm... sorry.
440	00:26:51	00:26:52	I'm not.
441	00:26:52	00:26:54	I'm done being sorry.
442	00:26:54	00:26:57	Or... afraid.
443	00:26:57	00:27:00	Or reflective.
444	00:27:00	00:27:02	I am in remission.
445	00:27:02	00:27:04	Thanks to Dr. Ryan.
446	00:27:04	00:27:07	And to Jeffrey's positive attitude.
447	00:27:07	00:27:08	And who is Jeffrey?
448	00:27:08	00:27:10	Jeffrey Fitzgerald.
449	00:27:10	00:27:11	He's a beautiful man.
450	00:27:11	00:27:12	Inside and out.
451	00:27:14	00:27:18	Mrs. Kemp, is that wig made from your real hair?
452	00:27:18	00:27:24	When I started to lose my hair, someone recommended a wig maker.
453	00:27:24	00:27:27	Jeffrey.
454	00:27:27	00:27:34	When your insides are eroding, your outside's all you have left.
455	00:27:34	00:27:39	Your, uh, wig maker, Jeffrey, was he was the one who collected your hair to make the wig?
456	00:27:39	00:27:41	No. I did.
457	00:27:41	00:27:42	I brought it to his studio.
458	00:27:42	00:27:43	It's out near Silverado Ranch.
459	00:27:43	00:27:44	Along with some of my dresses.
460	00:27:44	00:27:46	As inspiration.
461	00:27:46	00:27:47	Inspiration?
462	00:27:47	00:27:49	Jeffrey is an artist.
463	00:27:49	00:27:54	He asked me when I felt the most beautiful, so that he could repaint my life.
464	00:27:54	00:27:58	He knows hair like Monet knows light.
465	00:27:58	00:28:00	When was the last time you saw Jeffrey?
466	00:28:00	00:28:02	Just a few days ago.
467	00:28:02	00:28:05	He still comes around to give me a comb-out.
468	00:28:05	00:28:10	He sounds very devoted to you.
469	00:28:17	00:28:20	Mr. Fitzgerald! LVPD!
470	00:28:29	00:28:31	Mr. Fitzgerald?
471	00:28:31	00:28:33	Police department!
472	00:28:50	00:28:52	Let me see your hands!
473	00:28:52	00:28:53	Let me go! Let me go!
474	00:28:53	00:28:55	What did you do to her?
475	00:29:01	00:29:02	Stop looking at my hair.
476	00:29:02	00:29:03	Sorry, I can't help myself.
477	00:29:03	00:29:05	Hey.
478	00:29:05	00:29:06	You're just lucky your client's not pressing charges.
479	00:29:06	00:29:08	Charges?
480	00:29:08	00:29:12	I was performing a service, which you interrupted. A service?
481	00:29:12	00:29:13	That's what you're calling it?
482	00:29:13	00:29:15	My client is...
483	00:29:15	00:29:17	how shall we say...
484	00:29:17	00:29:25	a professional woman who lost a valuable asset, her hair, but doesn't have the assets to afford a proper transplant.
485	00:29:25	00:29:36	And so, I offered her an affordable, stitching acrylic hair directly into the scalp. And do you have a license to do that?
486	00:29:36	00:29:38	I'm certified in body modification.
487	00:29:38	00:29:46	However, my main trade is wig making, for a clientele that needs restorations, not only of the hair, but of their self-esteem.
488	00:29:46	00:29:48	Yeah, we've seen your work.
489	00:29:48	00:29:49	You're quite the artist. Thank you.
490	00:29:49	00:29:54	I, uh, I like to think that I give back what God hath taken away.
491	00:29:54	00:29:59	Well, you hath a very inflated idea of yourself, Mr. Fitzgerald.
492	00:29:59	00:30:03	Image is everything.
493	00:30:07	00:30:09	I knew this guy on days.
494	00:30:09	00:30:11	He had a hair phobia.
495	00:30:11	00:30:15	Any time there was a crime scene involving hair, he'd puke his guts out.
496	00:30:15	00:30:17	He'd hate this.
497	00:30:17	00:30:18	I got one of those.
498	00:30:18	00:30:19	Really?
499	00:30:19	00:30:21	What's your kryptonite?
500	00:30:21	00:30:24	Braids.
501	00:30:24	00:30:25	You got a hair thing, too?
502	00:30:25	00:30:27	No.
503	00:30:27	00:30:28	Braids.
504	00:30:28	00:30:32	Jeffery Fitzgerald had a thing for braids.
505	00:30:36	00:30:38	And vintage clothing, too.
506	00:30:38	00:30:39	What?
507	00:30:41	00:30:43	That dress look familiar?
508	00:30:44	00:30:45	I do smell mothballs.
509	00:30:57	00:30:59	And I...
510	00:30:59	00:31:01	smell a serial killer.
511	00:31:11	00:31:14	I smell conviction.
512	00:31:14	00:31:15	So, um...
513	00:31:15	00:31:19	when are you two crazy kids gonna let me know why I'm here?
514	00:31:20	00:31:22	Lucinda Kemp.
515	00:31:22	00:31:24	One of the lives you restored.
516	00:31:24	00:31:27	Yeah, yes, I gave her back her hair, restored her beauty.
517	00:31:27	00:31:28	And you're still doing that.
518	00:31:28	00:31:30	You give her a comb-out every week.
519	00:31:30	00:31:33	Is combing out a crime now?
520	00:31:38	00:31:41	You know what I think all this is for him?
521	00:31:41	00:31:42	Foreplay.
522	00:31:42	00:31:46	Before you have your real fun with these girls, am I right?
523	00:31:46	00:31:49	Do you recognize that morphine?
524	00:31:49	00:31:52	We found morphine in two dead women.
525	00:31:52	00:31:55	I've never seen it before.
526	00:31:55	00:31:56	Our guys just discovered it in your studio.
527	00:32:01	00:32:09	You found unmarked morphine, in a place that I rent, after you let yourself in without an invitation.
528	00:32:11	00:32:16	I'm sorry, I just don't see how that problem relates to me at all.
529	00:32:16	00:32:19	Legally speaking.
530	00:32:19	00:32:22	Fitzgerald can play cute all he likes.
531	00:32:22	00:32:23	We still hit the mother lode.
532	00:32:23	00:32:25	Lucinda's dress, Lucinda's hair, the morphine.
533	00:32:25	00:32:26	We got him.
534	00:32:26	00:32:28	What about hair braids?
535	00:32:28	00:32:31	Greg's running them now, along with the rest of the hair from Fitzgerald's studio.
536	00:32:31	00:32:33	You do not want to go into trace lab right now.
537	00:32:33	00:32:36	Where I don't want to go is into court without a DNA match on the hair.
538	00:32:36	00:32:43	I mean, all the morphine and dresses in the world won't matter at all if we can't connect Fitzgerald directly to the victim.
539	00:32:43	00:32:44	I hear you.
540	00:32:44	00:32:45	We got this. Okay, okay.
541	00:32:49	00:32:51	Paula?
542	00:32:51	00:32:52	Please, help.
543	00:32:52	00:32:55	I got free, but I can't see.
544	00:32:55	00:32:56	He forgot something downstairs.
545	00:32:58	00:33:00	I think he's coming back!
546	00:33:00	00:33:02	Paula!
547	00:33:07	00:33:09	LVPD!
548	00:33:31	00:33:32	Russell.
549	00:33:54	00:33:55	You okay?
550	00:33:58	00:34:00	Guy was interrupted.
551	00:34:03	00:34:04	Panicked.
552	00:34:04	00:34:05	Killed her quick.
553	00:34:05	00:34:08	He knew we were coming.
554	00:34:08	00:34:11	There's nothing you could've done.
555	00:34:11	00:34:13	Our best suspect was in custody.
556	00:34:13	00:34:16	Well, he's not our best anymore, is he?
557	00:34:16	00:34:19	Well, I want to know who is.
558	00:34:23	00:34:25	I don't know.
559	00:34:27	00:34:28	But he left a mess.
560	00:34:28	00:34:30	We'll find something.
561	00:34:33	00:34:36	Hey, Russell, we just got the call-- what's going on?
562	00:34:36	00:34:39	Process this scene with a fine-toothed comb.
563	00:34:39	00:34:40	Every inch of it.
564	00:34:43	00:34:44	Call me.
565	00:34:44	00:34:47	Yeah, you got it.
566	00:34:57	00:35:00	Man... I really thought we had this guy.
567	00:35:00	00:35:02	Well, who says we don't?
568	00:35:02	00:35:05	Maybe our wigmaker isn't working alone.
569	00:35:05	00:35:07	The hairs say we don't.
570	00:35:07	00:35:11	All of the wigs, the braids, the-the bales of hair from his studio.
571	00:35:11	00:35:13	None are a match to our victims.
572	00:35:13	00:35:15	Well, somebody really went after these women.
573	00:35:15	00:35:18	Yeah, somebody who had to have had a connection to Lucinda Kemp.
574	00:35:25	00:35:27	I got some short brown hairs here.
575	00:35:27	00:35:30	Obviously didn't come from her.
576	00:35:30	00:35:34	From our killer? Could be. We should be able to get a good DNA sample.
577	00:35:34	00:35:36	Hairs have tags that are pulled out at the root.
578	00:35:36	00:35:38	Might've happened during the struggle.
579	00:35:38	00:35:40	Mm-hmm.
580	00:35:47	00:35:50	Got what looks like a corner of a photo.
581	00:35:51	00:35:54	Well, where's the rest of it?
582	00:35:59	00:36:00	Here it is.
583	00:36:02	00:36:07	Killer might have jammed it up here for reference.
584	00:36:08	00:36:10	Wait a minute, now.
585	00:36:10	00:36:13	Now, does that look like a young Lucinda Kemp to you?
586	00:36:13	00:36:15	Sure does.
587	00:36:15	00:36:23	Well, if Jeffrey Fitzgerald isn't our killer, maybe it's someone who's even closer to Lucinda.
588	00:36:23	00:36:25	You think it's the son? You talked to him.
589	00:36:26	00:36:28	Hm.
590	00:36:28	00:36:31	Looks like we might have a pretty good print here.
591	00:36:31	00:36:32	We'll figure it out.
592	00:36:54	00:36:56	I'm sorry.
593	00:36:58	00:37:04	Where are we? Henry's running DNA on the hair, and Nick's working on the print-- we should have an answer soon.
594	00:37:06	00:37:10	When I was in Seattle, we had some guy running around...
595	00:37:10	00:37:12	killing coeds...
596	00:37:12	00:37:15	and my daughter was...
597	00:37:16	00:37:19	...roughly the same age at that time.
598	00:37:19	00:37:22	Every crime scene was like walking into her dorm room.
599	00:37:22	00:37:23	Did you catch the guy?
600	00:37:23	00:37:25	Yeah.
601	00:37:25	00:37:28	We're gonna catch this guy, too.
602	00:37:31	00:37:33	Yeah.
603	00:37:41	00:37:45	Can I tell you something crazy?
604	00:37:45	00:37:52	You know how kids are always bumping into something or falling onto something and they got those cuts and scrapes?
605	00:37:52	00:37:56	I've been saving my kids' Band-Aids for years.
606	00:37:57	00:38:00	Keep them in the refrigerator.
607	00:38:00	00:38:01	DNA reference.
608	00:38:01	00:38:03	Yeah.
609	00:38:03	00:38:05	It's not so crazy.
610	00:38:06	00:38:09	I know somebody who used to work here.
611	00:38:09	00:38:11	She used to do the same thing.
612	00:38:42	00:38:46	Henry ran DNA on that hair we found in Paula Bingham's bathroom.
613	00:38:46	00:38:48	Yeah? Compared it to Lucinda Kemp.
614	00:38:48	00:38:50	No familial match.
615	00:38:50	00:38:51	It's not Adam.
616	00:38:51	00:38:53	Are you sure about that? Yeah.
617	00:38:53	00:38:55	'Cause I ran it again myself.
618	00:38:55	00:38:57	Her son's not our killer.
619	00:38:57	00:39:00	So we're down to the print.
620	00:39:00	00:39:02	Moment of truth.
621	00:39:07	00:39:09	That's our guy?
622	00:39:13	00:39:15	What, not even a courtesy call this time?
623	00:39:15	00:39:17	Not this time.
624	00:39:25	00:39:30	Perhaps we should have this conversation in my office. I think we should do it down at the station.
625	00:39:40	00:39:45	First we thought this was a picture of Lucinda Kemp, but it's not, is it?
626	00:39:45	00:39:48	It's your mother, back when she was...
627	00:39:48	00:39:51	young and healthy. And beautiful.
628	00:39:51	00:39:53	Before the cancer took it all away.
629	00:39:53	00:39:56	Hospital records show, uh, your mother died at age 51.
630	00:39:56	00:40:00	Yeah, but I'm sure she looked a lot older by then-- a lot like Lucinda Kemp.
631	00:40:00	00:40:02	That's when all this started, isn't it?
632	00:40:02	00:40:07	Lucinda came to you for treatment, and it was like your mother was coming back.
633	00:40:09	00:40:11	Hey, Doc!
634	00:40:11	00:40:13	We searched your house.
635	00:40:13	00:40:14	We found the hair products.
636	00:40:14	00:40:15	We found the makeup.
637	00:40:15	00:40:18	Same brands Lucinda uses.
638	00:40:18	00:40:20	You washed her hair; you helped her with her makeup.
639	00:40:20	00:40:24	Must have been great to have Mom back again, right?
640	00:40:24	00:40:28	Right up until you didn't. Until Jeffrey the wig guy gave her something that her doctor couldn't.
641	00:40:28	00:40:32	I wasn't just her doctor; I was everything to her.
642	00:40:32	00:40:34	Lean back...
643	00:40:41	00:40:43	Yeah, but then she left you, right?
644	00:40:43	00:40:45	Just like your mother did?
645	00:40:45	00:40:48	No, actually, not exactly like your mother did.
646	00:40:48	00:40:51	Because you didn't put Lucinda out of her misery, the way you did Mom.
647	00:40:51	00:40:52	Found that in the medical records, too.
648	00:40:52	00:40:54	Death by morphine overdose.
649	00:40:54	00:41:00	Hospital investigation proved inconclusive, but you were interning at the same hospital, right?
650	00:41:00	00:41:01	Wow.
651	00:41:01	00:41:02	You killed your mother.
652	00:41:02	00:41:04	I ended her pain!
653	00:41:04	00:41:06	Yeah.
654	00:41:06	00:41:10	Just like you did those other women-- Eva...
655	00:41:10	00:41:12	Joyce, Paula...
656	00:41:12	00:41:15	All attempts to recreate your mother.
657	00:41:15	00:41:22	We found the hair that you cut from all those women, with the date and place when it was taken.
658	00:41:22	00:41:24	You are a very meticulous...
659	00:41:24	00:41:25	man, Dr. Ryan.
660	00:41:25	00:41:27	You're kind of a mama's boy, actually.
661	00:41:27	00:41:28	Do you think you know me?!
662	00:41:28	00:41:31	You don't know me at all.
663	00:41:37	00:41:39	You know something? You're right, I don't.
664	00:41:41	00:41:43	I need to step out for a minute.
665	00:41:46	00:41:48	You're done, Doc.
666	00:42:07	00:42:09	Hey, Catherine.
667	00:42:09	00:42:10	I didn't wake you up, did I?
668	00:42:10	00:42:14	No, I know, I know, I'm gonna go home in a minute.
669	00:42:14	00:42:17	I'm just not quite ready yet, you know?
670	00:42:18	00:42:20	One of those days.
671	00:42:20	00:42:22	No, we're fine, we're fine.
672	00:42:22	00:42:29	Uh... my wife and I have a little contract between us-- there are certain things I don't bring home from work.
673	00:42:30	00:42:33	And, um...
674	00:42:33	00:42:35	well, today, um...
675	00:42:38	00:42:43	I lost one today, Catherine, and, uh...
676	00:42:43	00:42:52	you know, I can't stop seeing her-her face, and... can't stop feeling like, you know, there's something I should have done, you know, something more.
677	00:42:52	00:42:54	No, I know, I know.
678	00:42:54	00:42:55	I-I will, I will.
679	00:42:55	00:42:57	It's, um...
680	00:42:57	00:43:01	I just wanted to talk to you.
681	00:43:01	00:43:02	Knew you'd understand.
