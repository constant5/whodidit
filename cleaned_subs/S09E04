0,00:00:06,00:00:07,(weakly): Help...
1,00:00:09,00:00:10,(louder): Help.
2,00:00:10,00:00:14,"I need, I need... brains."
3,00:00:14,00:00:16,Brains.
4,00:00:16,00:00:17,I smell your brains.
5,00:00:17,00:00:18,(laughs)
6,00:00:18,00:00:20,"RILEY: Halloween's tomorrow, Nick."
7,00:00:20,00:00:22,"Yeah, in Vegas, we celebrate all week."
8,00:00:22,00:00:24,"Yeah, we're just getting some coffee."
9,00:00:24,00:00:25,We'll be there in five.
10,00:00:26,00:00:27,We need to process another 407.
11,00:00:27,00:00:29,"Liquor store, Landston and Fifth."
12,00:00:30,00:00:31,Let me guess: robbed by a cop?
13,00:00:31,00:00:33,"Yeah, third one tonight."
14,00:00:33,00:00:34,Great costumes.
15,00:00:34,00:00:35,That's what I wore last year.
16,00:00:35,00:00:37,"Me, too."
17,00:00:37,00:00:38,(door bells jingle) Hey!
18,00:00:39,00:00:41,Stop that guy!
19,00:00:41,00:00:42,That cop just robbed me!
20,00:00:42,00:00:44,(glass bottles clattering)
21,00:00:48,00:00:49,Stop!
22,00:00:49,00:00:50,Police! Stop!
23,00:00:52,00:00:54,(panting)
24,00:01:00,00:01:01,"(gunfire, bullets ricocheting)"
25,00:01:01,00:01:03,Down! Down!
26,00:01:03,00:01:04,(glass shattering)
27,00:01:04,00:01:06,(grunts)
28,00:01:08,00:01:09,He's going inside. I'm going after him!
29,00:01:09,00:01:10,What? You go around front.
30,00:01:10,00:01:12,Call for help! Are you sure?
31,00:01:12,00:01:13,Go!
32,00:01:14,00:01:15,(beep)
33,00:01:15,00:01:16,"Control, CSI Adams."
34,00:01:16,00:01:19,I got a 443 in the alley behind the liquor store on Industrial.
35,00:01:19,00:01:20,Shots fired.
36,00:01:20,00:01:21,I repeat: shots fired.
37,00:01:22,00:01:23,Suspect is wearing a blue police uniform.
38,00:01:23,00:01:25,CSI Stokes is in foot pursuit.
39,00:01:29,00:01:30,Hey!
40,00:01:30,00:01:31,(gunfire blasting)
41,00:01:31,00:01:33,(steam hissing)
42,00:01:33,00:01:35,(panting)
43,00:02:03,00:02:05,(grunting)
44,00:02:19,00:02:20,That's it!
45,00:02:20,00:02:21,That's it! It's over!
46,00:02:21,00:02:23,Stay down.
47,00:02:24,00:02:26,"Come on, man. Don't."
48,00:02:30,00:02:31,(screaming)
49,00:02:31,00:02:32,(crash)
50,00:02:32,00:02:35,(sirens approaching)
51,00:02:44,00:02:47,Guy's robbed his last liquor store.
52,00:02:55,00:02:57,He's got company.
53,00:02:59,00:03:01,(indistinct radio chatter)
54,00:03:01,00:03:04,"GRISSOM: You know, Nick. You're lucky you're not in here, too."
55,00:03:04,00:03:06,STOKES: Understood.
56,00:03:09,00:03:11,Well...
57,00:03:11,00:03:14,I guess a broken mirror does bring bad luck.
58,00:03:15,00:03:20,"Guy died for small bills, beef jerky and a porno."
59,00:03:20,00:03:23,"ADAMS: Hard up, hungry and dumb."
60,00:03:23,00:03:25,It's no way to go through life.
61,00:03:25,00:03:28,"GRISSOM: Yeah, well, at least he helped us find this poor dead girl."
62,00:03:28,00:03:31,Dumpster belongs to the glass and mirror place.
63,00:03:31,00:03:35,Patrol company said the owner closed up at 5:00.
64,00:03:36,00:03:38,She smells fresh.
65,00:03:38,00:03:42,"Well, this was a dark alley."
66,00:03:42,00:03:43,Maybe she was a working girl.
67,00:03:43,00:03:45,Picked up a john with a bad temper.
68,00:03:45,00:03:46,Yeah.
69,00:03:46,00:03:48,Trick or treat.
70,00:05:16,00:05:19,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it."
71,00:05:20,00:05:22,Take a look at this.
72,00:05:23,00:05:26,STOKES: Is that a tattoo?
73,00:05:28,00:05:30,A fish.
74,00:05:34,00:05:36,It's temporary ink.
75,00:05:36,00:05:39,Could be a transfer or a stamp from a club.
76,00:05:39,00:05:42,"Back in St. Louis, Vice always kept a database of club stamps."
77,00:05:42,00:05:44,Our guys will know where it came from.
78,00:05:44,00:05:49,"Maybe if we can figure out where she was, it will lead us to who she is."
79,00:05:52,00:05:55,(dance music blaring)
80,00:06:09,00:06:11,I hate Halloween.
81,00:06:11,00:06:15,Looks like a bunch of adults going as teenagers this year.
82,00:06:35,00:06:37,Hey!
83,00:06:37,00:06:38,She's underage.
84,00:06:38,00:06:40,"Touch her again, you're going to jail."
85,00:06:40,00:06:41,Whatever. Mom!
86,00:06:41,00:06:43,What do you think you're doing here? Dancing.
87,00:06:43,00:06:44,What does it look like? Where's the I.D.?
88,00:06:45,00:06:46,"Want a urine sample, too?"
89,00:06:47,00:06:48,Draw my blood?
90,00:06:51,00:06:52,Jasmine Davidov?
91,00:06:52,00:06:56,"Don't the police have anything better to do than chase me down? You bet we do, Lindsey."
92,00:06:56,00:06:58,A girl your age was here last night.
93,00:06:58,00:07:00,She was murdered.
94,00:07:01,00:07:03,Just take her home.
95,00:07:05,00:07:08,You moonlighting as a bouncer now?
96,00:07:08,00:07:10,"When you have kids, you can talk to me about it then."
97,00:07:10,00:07:12,"Well, we won't be talking soon then."
98,00:07:12,00:07:14,Vic was definitely working the VIP section.
99,00:07:16,00:07:18,She wasn't wearing a wristband.
100,00:07:18,00:07:20,She must have been juiced in through the back.
101,00:07:20,00:07:23,You only get a wristband if you pay the cover at the front.
102,00:07:23,00:07:25,"Okay, next."
103,00:07:25,00:07:26,There you go.
104,00:07:28,00:07:30,Owner's over there.
105,00:07:34,00:07:37,Finish puberty somewhere else.
106,00:07:37,00:07:39,Me and Mr. Big here need to talk.
107,00:07:40,00:07:42,"See you in a bit, ladies."
108,00:07:46,00:07:50,She was found in a Dumpster about two blocks from here.
109,00:07:50,00:07:53,She was wearing one of your slut-of-the week stamps on her thigh.
110,00:07:53,00:07:55,Recognize her?
111,00:07:55,00:07:56,No.
112,00:07:56,00:07:59,But I don't get a good look at every girl who walks in through the door.
113,00:07:59,00:08:03,"Anything else I can help you with? Yeah, as a matter of fact, there is."
114,00:08:04,00:08:06,I found my underage daughter on your dance floor.
115,00:08:06,00:08:09,I could card everyone in the place right now and shut you down.
116,00:08:09,00:08:13,"If your daughter got in here, she was using a fake I.D."
117,00:08:13,00:08:15,That's not poor club management.
118,00:08:15,00:08:18,It's poor parenting.
119,00:08:18,00:08:23,"You don't want to blame yourself, so you slap a fine on me."
120,00:08:23,00:08:26,A fine is going to be the least of your worries.
121,00:08:31,00:08:37,"You know, it's one thing when kids dress up as a cop on Halloween, but when grown-ups do it-- it never ends well."
122,00:08:37,00:08:39,Mm-mm. Got an I.D. yet?
123,00:08:39,00:08:41,Gun's unregistered.
124,00:08:41,00:08:43,I dusted it. Nothing but smudges.
125,00:08:43,00:08:46,"So, how did Rocky the Flying Squirrel get his uniform?"
126,00:08:46,00:08:50,"The patch is a Reno city seal, but anybody can get one of those at a swap meet."
127,00:08:50,00:08:53,"Hand me the ALS, will you?"
128,00:08:57,00:09:00,What? It's just been a while since I've seen you use one of those.
129,00:09:00,00:09:02,Just like riding a bicycle.
130,00:09:02,00:09:03,"What, you don't want to share your toys?"
131,00:09:03,00:09:04,Please. Mm.
132,00:09:05,00:09:07,"(beep, whirring)"
133,00:09:08,00:09:10,This is the pocket where the cops keep their pens.
134,00:09:10,00:09:14,And they're always forgetting to retract the points.
135,00:09:14,00:09:17,"You know, I don't think this is a costume."
136,00:09:17,00:09:20,"Okay, but real cops don't wear prom shoes, man."
137,00:09:20,00:09:22,So everything's fake except the uniform.
138,00:09:22,00:09:25,"Which means, somewhere a real cop was wearing it."
139,00:09:25,00:09:26,"Well, I'll contact Reno."
140,00:09:26,00:09:29,See if anybody was down here on official business.
141,00:09:29,00:09:35,"SANDERS: Sexy kitty, sexy nurse, sexy hula dancer, guy dressed like pimp."
142,00:09:36,00:09:37,These guys have no imagination.
143,00:09:38,00:09:40,Club's using monochromatic daylight cameras at night.
144,00:09:40,00:09:43,And they're all pointed somewhere pretty much useless.
145,00:09:43,00:09:45,Except for the front door.
146,00:09:45,00:09:48,Now we don't have our girl arriving.
147,00:09:48,00:09:50,Consistent with her not having wristband.
148,00:09:50,00:09:51,Right.
149,00:09:51,00:09:53,But here she is leaving.
150,00:09:54,00:09:57,She starts out pretty upset.
151,00:09:59,00:10:02,"That's the club owner, Craig Hess."
152,00:10:02,00:10:04,Instant attitude adjustment.
153,00:10:04,00:10:08,This is approximately four hours before we found her.
154,00:10:08,00:10:11,"She's a VIP, and they bounced her?"
155,00:10:13,00:10:15,What did that guy say to her?
156,00:10:15,00:10:17,(camera shutter clicking)
157,00:10:49,00:10:51,"(Willows speaking, muffled)"
158,00:10:54,00:10:57,"(muffled, distant): Does it look that way to you, Gil?"
159,00:10:57,00:10:59,(Willows speaks indistinctly)
160,00:11:01,00:11:02,Did you hear anything I said?
161,00:11:03,00:11:05,(clearly): The wounds from the glass...
162,00:11:05,00:11:08,they appear to be superficial?
163,00:11:11,00:11:13,Yeah.
164,00:11:13,00:11:16,No vital response in the tissue.
165,00:11:16,00:11:18,Postmortem.
166,00:11:19,00:11:21,(sighs)
167,00:11:21,00:11:23,You getting any sleep?
168,00:11:27,00:11:29,"Me, neither."
169,00:11:29,00:11:31,What do you hear from Sara?
170,00:11:33,00:11:35,I don't know where she is.
171,00:11:41,00:11:44,She's got needle marks in both arms.
172,00:11:44,00:11:46,No scar tissue.
173,00:11:46,00:11:47,This has to be recent.
174,00:11:47,00:11:52,Drug users don't usually start off shooting it.
175,00:11:52,00:11:54,Snort it or smoke it first.
176,00:11:57,00:12:00,"White powder in the nose, most likely cocaine."
177,00:12:06,00:12:07,Hives.
178,00:12:07,00:12:11,"Histamine reaction, maybe from the drugs?"
179,00:12:11,00:12:16,Wonder if she told her parents she was just going dancing and they believed her.
180,00:12:16,00:12:18,(knocking)
181,00:12:19,00:12:21,"Grissom, got something for you."
182,00:12:22,00:12:27,Your female victim popped up in the Homeland Security database.
183,00:12:27,00:12:29,Angela Marie Carlos.
184,00:12:29,00:12:33,"19, going to college in Salt Lake City-- from Cali, Colombia."
185,00:12:33,00:12:35,She's here on a student visa?
186,00:12:35,00:12:36,"Yeah, but it gets even better."
187,00:12:36,00:12:38,Father is Juan Ramon Carlos.
188,00:12:38,00:12:44,"He's on a lot of Top 10 lists: FBI, CIA, DEA."
189,00:12:44,00:12:45,He's a major drug lord.
190,00:12:45,00:12:48,So maybe somebody was trying to get to him through her.
191,00:12:48,00:12:50,What do we know about his Vegas connections?
192,00:12:50,00:12:53,Besides every drug dealer in town?
193,00:12:53,00:12:55,He's got a sister in Henderson.
194,00:12:55,00:12:57,I'm on my way to make the notification.
195,00:12:58,00:13:00,I'd like to go.
196,00:13:07,00:13:10,I was there the day she was born.
197,00:13:10,00:13:15,"That day and every day since, I prayed to God to protect her."
198,00:13:15,00:13:19,But I think our family has tried his patience too long.
199,00:13:20,00:13:32,"Miss Carlos, I know there are no words that could possibly make this easier to bear, but maybe helping us find who took her away might bring you some comfort."
200,00:13:35,00:13:37,When was the last time that you saw Angela?
201,00:13:37,00:13:39,Two months ago. (sniffles)
202,00:13:39,00:13:42,When she went to college in Utah.
203,00:13:42,00:13:44,"Until then, she was living with me."
204,00:13:44,00:13:46,(sniffles)
205,00:13:46,00:13:47,Going to school here.
206,00:13:48,00:13:49,Why Utah?
207,00:13:49,00:13:52,Because it's not Las Vegas.
208,00:13:52,00:13:53,She's like her mother.
209,00:13:53,00:13:55,She likes to party.
210,00:13:57,00:13:59,Juan did not approve.
211,00:13:59,00:14:02,Did you know that she was back in town?
212,00:14:02,00:14:04,No.
213,00:14:04,00:14:05,Did she have many friends?
214,00:14:05,00:14:10,"Money buys you a lot of people, but... but not a lot of friends."
215,00:14:11,00:14:13,"Except for one girl, Sylvie."
216,00:14:15,00:14:18,They went to high school together.
217,00:14:18,00:14:20,They were like sisters.
218,00:14:20,00:14:22,They would talk all night on the phone...
219,00:14:23,00:14:26,Sleepovers and shopping and...
220,00:14:29,00:14:31,You can...
221,00:14:31,00:14:38,"you can love someone with your heart and your soul, but you can't protect them 24 hours a day."
222,00:14:39,00:14:44,"You can catch whoever did this, but it doesn't matter."
223,00:14:44,00:14:47,Juan will never forgive me.
224,00:14:47,00:14:48,(sighs)
225,00:14:57,00:14:59,STOKES: So why'd you bring your uniform to Vegas?
226,00:14:59,00:15:04,BRADY: I brought it because I was testifying in a case.
227,00:15:04,00:15:06,Held over a couple days for cross.
228,00:15:06,00:15:07,Thanks. Yeah.
229,00:15:07,00:15:09,So I thought I'd see the sights.
230,00:15:09,00:15:12,What happened to your uniform?
231,00:15:12,00:15:17,"Well, I'm walking through the casino just minding my own..."
232,00:15:17,00:15:20,"Hot girl comes up, wants to buy me a drink."
233,00:15:20,00:15:22,You know the type.
234,00:15:22,00:15:23,Donut Dolly.
235,00:15:23,00:15:28,"Wanted to wear my uniform, use all the tools."
236,00:15:28,00:15:31,You're a bad cop. (Brady chuckling)
237,00:15:31,00:15:34,"You've been a bad boy, and I'm really gonna punish you."
238,00:15:34,00:15:36,"Yeah, you like that, don't you?"
239,00:15:36,00:15:37,(both laughing)
240,00:15:37,00:15:39,I've been a bad officer.
241,00:15:39,00:15:43,I had to send my uniform out to the hotel cleaners.
242,00:15:43,00:15:46,That's smart. Juries do find you more credible when you're not reeking of champagne.
243,00:15:46,00:15:50,"So, when I didn't get it back, I called housekeeping."
244,00:15:50,00:15:52,They said they hung it on the door.
245,00:15:52,00:15:53,Okay.
246,00:15:53,00:15:54,What hotel?
247,00:15:54,00:15:55,Palermo.
248,00:15:55,00:15:58,Room 914.
249,00:15:58,00:16:01,I am gonna get hell from my department.
250,00:16:01,00:16:02,Mm-hmm.
251,00:16:02,00:16:04,But it was worth it.
252,00:16:05,00:16:08,"See what I can do, Casanova."
253,00:16:08,00:16:12,"If Angela's in trouble, I'm talking to her before I'm talking to you."
254,00:16:12,00:16:14,"Well, she's more than in trouble."
255,00:16:14,00:16:16,She's dead.
256,00:16:18,00:16:19,(sighs)
257,00:16:19,00:16:21,Were you with her the night before last?
258,00:16:21,00:16:26,Ange said Salt Lake was lame for Halloween and she was road-tripping it to Vegas.
259,00:16:26,00:16:29,We changed at my place.
260,00:16:29,00:16:33,Then Ange wanted to go get some party supplies.
261,00:16:33,00:16:34,Party supplies?
262,00:16:34,00:16:38,I had friends who could get us into the Dark Water Bar.
263,00:16:38,00:16:40,Ange said she could take it from there.
264,00:16:40,00:16:43,She said the owner was a friend of her family.
265,00:16:43,00:16:46,"(dance music playing, laughter)"
266,00:16:46,00:16:47,Here's to us.
267,00:16:48,00:16:49,You trying to get me killed?
268,00:16:49,00:16:51,Come on. Just help me out.
269,00:16:51,00:16:52,"Whatever you want, I'll give you."
270,00:16:52,00:16:54,What I want is you out.
271,00:16:54,00:16:56,Get your hands off me.
272,00:16:56,00:16:58,"So, did you leave with her?"
273,00:16:58,00:16:59,No.
274,00:17:00,00:17:01,I hooked up with this guy.
275,00:17:01,00:17:05,Texted her to meet up with us at some party.
276,00:17:05,00:17:07,Weren't you worried about what might happen to her?
277,00:17:08,00:17:10,Nobody touches Angela.
278,00:17:19,00:17:21,Now what?
279,00:17:21,00:17:22,You lied.
280,00:17:22,00:17:24,It means I like you.
281,00:17:24,00:17:26,We have a witness... and surveillance footage.
282,00:17:26,00:17:31,"Angela Carlos was here the night she died, and you talked to her."
283,00:17:32,00:17:34,Okay.
284,00:17:34,00:17:38,Somebody who's not working here anymore let her in through the back.
285,00:17:38,00:17:42,"As soon as I saw she was in the club, I sent her out through the front. So, you do know her?"
286,00:17:43,00:17:44,Did I say that?
287,00:17:44,00:17:47,I think you do business with her father.
288,00:17:47,00:17:50,And that kind of business can put you out of business.
289,00:17:50,00:17:52,Who is her father?
290,00:17:54,00:17:58,It's clear on the video that whatever you said to her got her to leave.
291,00:17:58,00:18:00,What was it?
292,00:18:00,00:18:02,"Rendezvous at your place, drugs for sex?"
293,00:18:02,00:18:04,'Cause it wouldn't be the first time.
294,00:18:04,00:18:09,"Arrested for statutory rape, assault, and drug charges with a 17-year-old girl."
295,00:18:10,00:18:12,I was 21 years old.
296,00:18:12,00:18:14,Those charges were dropped.
297,00:18:14,00:18:18,"Girl wants to party, get a little bit rough-- it's a date."
298,00:18:18,00:18:22,She doesn't get flowers in the morning-- it's rape.
299,00:18:22,00:18:24,"Look, that's it."
300,00:18:25,00:18:28,I'm done talking to you.
301,00:18:30,00:18:33,PHILLIPS: There's still something in this wound.
302,00:18:33,00:18:35,Glass.
303,00:18:35,00:18:37,It's different from the other shards in the dumpster.
304,00:18:37,00:18:39,What do you notice about the wound?
305,00:18:39,00:18:42,"It's red, which suggests a vital response to the incision."
306,00:18:42,00:18:45,Appears to be perimortem.
307,00:18:45,00:18:47,Go for it.
308,00:18:56,00:18:57,I'll get it to Trace.
309,00:19:01,00:19:03,David. Gil.
310,00:19:06,00:19:09,You've got something I've never seen before.
311,00:19:09,00:19:12,Said the chorus girl to the bishop.
312,00:19:14,00:19:18,GRISSOM: No separation between the blood cells and the serum.
313,00:19:19,00:19:20,Her blood's hemolyzed.
314,00:19:20,00:19:23,You usually only see that when the body is in advanced decomp.
315,00:19:23,00:19:29,"An unknown chemical imbalance triggered a pressure change in the red blood cells, which caused them to rupture."
316,00:19:29,00:19:31,What could cause this?
317,00:19:31,00:19:32,Number of things.
318,00:19:32,00:19:34,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
319,00:19:34,00:19:36,Certain blood diseases.
320,00:19:36,00:19:37,Transfusion reaction.
321,00:19:37,00:19:41,Even chemical warfare agents like sarin or ricin.
322,00:19:41,00:19:43,"Worth the trip, wasn't it?"
323,00:19:43,00:19:45,Hives associated with any of those?
324,00:19:45,00:19:47,Most of them.
325,00:19:47,00:19:52,"I've requested her medical records, tox and DNA, and I'm waiting on those before I certify C.O.D."
326,00:19:52,00:19:53,Let me know.
327,00:19:53,00:19:57,"I will. And, uh, yes, it was worth the trip."
328,00:20:43,00:20:45,(computer beeps)
329,00:20:46,00:20:49,(computer chirps)
330,00:20:50,00:20:52,(beep)
331,00:20:54,00:20:55,(beep)
332,00:20:56,00:20:57,(beep)
333,00:20:59,00:21:03,(trilling)
334,00:21:04,00:21:08,Please tell me you got a hit off my Dumpster-diver's print.
335,00:21:08,00:21:09,"Yeah, I'm running them now."
336,00:21:09,00:21:11,"Hey, my timing's perfect."
337,00:21:11,00:21:14,Isn't it always?
338,00:21:15,00:21:20,"""Thomas Taylor, Bakersfield, California."" Ooh, he's an angry guy."
339,00:21:20,00:21:25,"Kind of like two assaults, B&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;E, DUI..."
340,00:21:25,00:21:27,Add DOA to the list.
341,00:21:27,00:21:31,(footsteps approaching)
342,00:21:31,00:21:33,Oh.
343,00:21:33,00:21:34,(beep)
344,00:21:34,00:21:36,You're supposed to be at home.
345,00:21:36,00:21:38,That's what being grounded means.
346,00:21:38,00:21:40,I wasn't doing anything wrong.
347,00:21:40,00:21:42,I wasn't even drinking.
348,00:21:43,00:21:45,Breathalyzer results.
349,00:21:45,00:21:48,I made the cop who drove me home test me.
350,00:21:48,00:21:53,"I know I shouldn't have been using a fake I.D., and I'm sorry."
351,00:21:53,00:21:56,But you overreacted.
352,00:21:56,00:21:59,I'll be the judge of that.
353,00:21:59,00:22:05,"I know you're dealing with a lot right now, but you don't have to worry about me."
354,00:22:05,00:22:09,Thanks... but I will.
355,00:22:11,00:22:13,And you're still grounded.
356,00:22:13,00:22:16,"(beep) Oh, hey."
357,00:22:16,00:22:18,Gil.
358,00:22:18,00:22:22,"So, I scored two tickets to this Alec Knight lecture."
359,00:22:22,00:22:29,"He's, of course you know, challenging the Russian claim that the Romanov remains found in Ekaterinburg are authentic."
360,00:22:32,00:22:33,Open bar.
361,00:22:33,00:22:37,Are you asking me out?
362,00:22:37,00:22:39,Is that a yes?
363,00:22:39,00:22:45,Do you have the results of the white powder that we found in Angela Carlos' nose?
364,00:22:45,00:22:47,Yes. It wasn't cocaine.
365,00:22:47,00:22:50,"Here, take a look."
366,00:22:50,00:22:51,(clears throat)
367,00:22:51,00:22:53,HODGES: It's atropine.
368,00:22:53,00:22:55,It's a stimulant often used to cut coke or methamphetamine.
369,00:22:56,00:23:00,But her tox report came back negative for both.
370,00:23:00,00:23:05,And atropine has a paradoxical reaction as a tranquilizer used on fish and other animals.
371,00:23:05,00:23:09,"So, how did it get in her nose?"
372,00:23:13,00:23:16,"So, we're still on for that lecture, right?"
373,00:23:16,00:23:18,Gil?
374,00:23:18,00:23:19,I checked with the Palermo.
375,00:23:19,00:23:21,Your Reno cop has a Tower room.
376,00:23:21,00:23:23,Takes a special room key to access those elevators.
377,00:23:24,00:23:28,"So, if the dead guy swiped his uniform, he was either a guest or an employee."
378,00:23:28,00:23:31,"We checked. He doesn't work there, and he wasn't registered."
379,00:23:31,00:23:34,What is a lowlife from Bakersfield doing in patent leather shoes anyway?
380,00:23:34,00:23:35,Who wears those things?
381,00:23:35,00:23:37,"Maybe he stole those, too."
382,00:23:37,00:23:41,"Yeah, or maybe he was in town for a wedding or reunion or something, and they were rentals."
383,00:23:41,00:23:43,I'm gonna check around. I'll get back to you.
384,00:23:43,00:23:46,"Hey, where's Catherine?"
385,00:23:46,00:23:47,Driving her daughter home.
386,00:23:47,00:23:49,Back any minute. Why?
387,00:23:49,00:23:51,I was just running the dead girl's phone records.
388,00:23:51,00:23:52,Got a GPS hit on her cell.
389,00:23:52,00:23:54,"If the killer's got it, we've got him. Yeah."
390,00:23:54,00:23:56,And it's on the move.
391,00:23:56,00:23:58,(siren whooping)
392,00:24:02,00:24:04,(sirens blaring)
393,00:24:16,00:24:19,"Riley Adams, Las Vegas Crime Lab."
394,00:24:19,00:24:21,Dump your load.
395,00:24:25,00:24:29,"Well, Angela's cell phone is in there somewhere."
396,00:24:29,00:24:31,SANDERS: What's the number?
397,00:24:31,00:24:34,555...
398,00:24:34,00:24:36,0122.
399,00:24:38,00:24:40,(phone rings faintly)
400,00:24:50,00:24:52,(phone continues ringing)
401,00:24:57,00:24:59,Here.
402,00:24:59,00:25:01,(ringing stops)
403,00:25:23,00:25:26,Bloody glass and the victim's purse.
404,00:25:26,00:25:31,"If this truck stopped at the Dark Water Bar, Craig Hess is looking dirty."
405,00:25:31,00:25:33,Looks like crime scene cleanup.
406,00:25:38,00:25:40,Got the garbage truck's route from the company.
407,00:25:40,00:25:42,We stopped the truck there.
408,00:25:42,00:25:45,We found Angela Carlos just off of Newall Street.
409,00:25:45,00:25:47,Hmm.
410,00:25:47,00:25:49,WILLOWS: Not on the route.
411,00:25:49,00:25:55,"She was last seen at the Dark Water Bar on Harmon, which isn't on the route, either."
412,00:25:55,00:25:58,"Hey, what about the club owner's home address?"
413,00:25:58,00:26:01,"""Craig Hess."
414,00:26:01,00:26:06,"""617 Cheery Bird Court, Henderson."" Oh. Well, that's way off the map."
415,00:26:06,00:26:12,"So, other than the fact that he lied to us about knowing the vic, we've got nothing on him."
416,00:26:16,00:26:19,"Wendy, what brings you to my store?"
417,00:26:19,00:26:26,"Well, I'm here on the Angela Carlos case 'cause I just ran her exemplar blood, and it came back a mixture."
418,00:26:26,00:26:27,"Oh, that's impossible."
419,00:26:27,00:26:29,I drew it from the heart. I don't know.
420,00:26:29,00:26:33,"I ran it twice, and both times, it came back as a mixture of one female and two male bloods."
421,00:26:36,00:26:37,It's definitely contaminated.
422,00:26:37,00:26:40,"Well, then it was contaminated on your end."
423,00:26:40,00:26:43,"No, I don't... I don't think so."
424,00:26:43,00:26:45,(wry laugh)
425,00:26:45,00:26:49,"Well, regardless, I'm going to need to get a clean exemplar."
426,00:26:49,00:26:51,Fine.
427,00:27:03,00:27:08,"Would, uh, deep tissue from the quadricep work for you, Ms. Simms?"
428,00:27:08,00:27:10,"Yes, that'd be fine."
429,00:27:10,00:27:12,Good.
430,00:27:16,00:27:17,(horns honking)
431,00:27:17,00:27:20,BRASS: Barry Wunderlick?
432,00:27:20,00:27:21,That his real name?
433,00:27:21,00:27:24,Real enough to get him a couple of tuxedoes and two pairs of patent leathers.
434,00:27:24,00:27:26,He rented them three days ago.
435,00:27:26,00:27:27,They were due back yesterday.
436,00:27:27,00:27:28,"And Barry's from Bakersfield, too."
437,00:27:28,00:27:30,"Oh, just like our fake cop."
438,00:27:30,00:27:32,"Yeah, so I checked with the Palermo, and get this."
439,00:27:32,00:27:35,Wunderlick still has the room right across the hall from Officer Brady.
440,00:27:36,00:27:39,"He was supposed to check out yesterday, but his stuff's still in there."
441,00:27:39,00:27:40,And he did get two keys.
442,00:27:40,00:27:42,Oh... Let me get this straight.
443,00:27:42,00:27:49,"So, two guys from Bakersfield come to Vegas, rent tuxedoes, steal a policeman's uniform, so that one of them can hold up a couple of liquor stores."
444,00:27:49,00:27:52,Is that the deal? That's what the evidence says.
445,00:27:52,00:27:54,"I'll flag his credit cards, put a broadcast out."
446,00:27:54,00:27:58,"SIMMS: So I ran the tissue sample, and it's clean."
447,00:27:58,00:28:00,It's purely Angela Carlos.
448,00:28:00,00:28:03,GRISSOM: So the first blood testwascontaminated?
449,00:28:03,00:28:04,No. It... No.
450,00:28:05,00:28:06,It was a mixture.
451,00:28:06,00:28:07,Three people's blood.
452,00:28:07,00:28:12,"It started me thinking, maybe her results explain the hemolysis."
453,00:28:12,00:28:19,"So, then I ran the blood stain from the glass that you pulled out of the victim's wounds, and I used that as a secondary standard."
454,00:28:19,00:28:20,Same results.
455,00:28:20,00:28:23,Confirmed the mixture of a female victim and two unknown males.
456,00:28:23,00:28:27,The only way that could have happened was if she'd received a blood transfusion.
457,00:28:28,00:28:29,From multiple donors.
458,00:28:29,00:28:31,With no medical necessity.
459,00:28:31,00:28:35,The victim was B-negative.
460,00:28:35,00:28:38,One of the male donors was O-negative.
461,00:28:38,00:28:40,The other one-- A-positive.
462,00:28:40,00:28:41,Then that's your COD.
463,00:28:42,00:28:46,A-positive would cause a major reaction with her blood type.
464,00:28:47,00:28:51,"Transfusion explains the, uh, needle marks on her arms and the hives."
465,00:28:51,00:28:55,"If somebody was trying to kill her, there were far easier ways to do it."
466,00:28:55,00:28:56,(sighs)
467,00:28:56,00:28:58,Girl goes out for a night on the town.
468,00:28:58,00:29:00,Wants to score some drugs.
469,00:29:01,00:29:05,Ends up with a snout full of atropine and a double transfusion.
470,00:29:05,00:29:11,"And unfortunately, it's impossible to separate the two male types from each other, which means that I can't run the DNA through CODIS."
471,00:29:11,00:29:14,Which now leaves us withtwounknown suspects.
472,00:29:20,00:29:23,Mr. Barry Wunderlick.
473,00:29:23,00:29:27,"This whole time we've been looking for him, he's been our house guest?"
474,00:29:27,00:29:30,"Arrested three days ago, drunk and disorderly."
475,00:29:30,00:29:32,Couldn't post bail.
476,00:29:32,00:29:35,I was just having me a bachelor party at the Acid Strip.
477,00:29:35,00:29:37,"How did you run up a tab of over five grand, Barry?"
478,00:29:37,00:29:38,Duh!
479,00:29:38,00:29:40,It's Vegas.
480,00:29:40,00:29:42,"You want 'em to touch you, you got to tip."
481,00:29:42,00:29:43,There's a four-drink minimum.
482,00:29:43,00:29:44,"What?! No, there isn't."
483,00:29:44,00:29:46,"Well, that's what she said, bro."
484,00:29:46,00:29:47,And you believed her?
485,00:29:47,00:29:49,She was smokin'.
486,00:29:49,00:29:51,Pushin' her junk up in our face. Ooh!
487,00:29:51,00:29:55,"Then, they come up and tell me that my credit card's no good no more."
488,00:29:55,00:29:57,They wanted cash.
489,00:29:57,00:30:00,Is that how the manager and two bartenders ended up in the ER?
490,00:30:01,00:30:02,They were trying to screw us.
491,00:30:03,00:30:04,(laughs and sniffles)
492,00:30:04,00:30:07,They didn't realize that they were messing with an ultimate fighter.
493,00:30:07,00:30:10,"Then, uh..."
494,00:30:10,00:30:12,Then you guys show up and arrest my ass.
495,00:30:12,00:30:14,What happened to your friend Tommy?
496,00:30:14,00:30:21,"I told him, ""Work up some cash and bail me out before the wedding."" My best man leaves me hanging."
497,00:30:21,00:30:23,Eh...
498,00:30:24,00:30:25,I don't even know if Candy Jean will have me now.
499,00:30:25,00:30:27,Your best man gave it his best shot.
500,00:30:27,00:30:30,For real?
501,00:30:30,00:30:32,For real.
502,00:30:32,00:30:36,"First, he stole a policeman's uniform from your hotel..."
503,00:30:37,00:30:40,then went on to commit four armed robberies in one night.
504,00:30:40,00:30:42,Put the money in the bag! (shrieks)
505,00:30:44,00:30:46,He did all that for me?
506,00:30:47,00:30:49,I guess my nine-mill did come in handy.
507,00:30:49,00:30:51,(laughs)
508,00:30:51,00:30:53,What?
509,00:30:53,00:30:55,Mm...
510,00:30:56,00:30:58,"Didn't end too good, did it?"
511,00:31:02,00:31:05,I'm just curious.
512,00:31:05,00:31:08,Why rent a tuxedo for a bachelor party?
513,00:31:08,00:31:11,It's Halloween.
514,00:31:11,00:31:13,Casino Royale's my favorite movie.
515,00:31:15,00:31:18,"I, uh... I kind of look like the guy who plays him."
516,00:31:19,00:31:21,Huh?
517,00:31:21,00:31:24,Bond. James Bond.
518,00:31:25,00:31:27,You get it?
519,00:31:27,00:31:28,"BRASS: Oh, I get it."
520,00:31:28,00:31:32,Wunderlick.BarryWunderlick.
521,00:31:40,00:31:43,(trilling)
522,00:31:44,00:31:46,(chirping)
523,00:31:53,00:31:55,(trilling)
524,00:31:58,00:32:01,(blipping)
525,00:32:06,00:32:08,(blipping)
526,00:33:02,00:33:04,(knocks)
527,00:33:04,00:33:07,Broke your case... again.
528,00:33:08,00:33:09,Go.
529,00:33:09,00:33:10,Fish.
530,00:33:10,00:33:15,I examined your vic's purse for trace and found what I thought to be a piece of skin.
531,00:33:15,00:33:17,Turns out I was right.
532,00:33:17,00:33:19,Fish skin.
533,00:33:19,00:33:21,Well...
534,00:33:21,00:33:24,anything that swims gets me closer to Hess.
535,00:33:24,00:33:27,"Carassius auratus, to be exact."
536,00:33:27,00:33:28,Goldfish.
537,00:33:28,00:33:31,"Good job, Hodges."
538,00:33:31,00:33:32,Thank you.
539,00:33:32,00:33:33,(inhales)
540,00:33:33,00:33:35,And there's more.
541,00:33:35,00:33:39,I analyzed the glass from the garbage bag and from the incised wound on your victim's scalp.
542,00:33:39,00:33:42,They're both lead crystal.
543,00:33:42,00:33:46,I took the pieces and used an approximation of their original shape.
544,00:33:48,00:33:50,I know what this is.
545,00:33:50,00:33:53,"A ""fishus abowlus."" (chuckles)"
546,00:33:53,00:33:55,That's very funny.
547,00:33:55,00:34:04,"Sam bought Lindsey an aquarium for her ninth birthday, filled it with exotic fish, and she loved it for all of 24 hours until she realized that the..."
548,00:34:04,00:34:08,fancy fish eat the goldfish for dinner.
549,00:34:08,00:34:12,Hmm... the circle of life.
550,00:34:14,00:34:16,You gotta be kidding me.
551,00:34:16,00:34:17,(door closes)
552,00:34:17,00:34:18,What do you feed your fish?
553,00:34:19,00:34:22,I don't feed my own fish.
554,00:34:22,00:34:23,I hate fish.
555,00:34:23,00:34:25,It's worse than owning racehorses.
556,00:34:25,00:34:26,Nothing but problems.
557,00:34:26,00:34:28,"They're, they're always getting sick."
558,00:34:28,00:34:31,You know how much it costs me to replace one of those big orange and white ones?
559,00:34:32,00:34:33,12 grand.
560,00:34:34,00:34:35,"So if you don't feed your fish, who does?"
561,00:34:35,00:34:38,My boy Goya.
562,00:34:38,00:34:41,He's got a warehouse over on Corville Street.
563,00:34:54,00:34:55,"Las Vegas PD. Whoa, whoa."
564,00:34:56,00:34:58,LVPD. Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
565,00:34:58,00:34:59,You got a warrant? Turn around.
566,00:34:59,00:35:00,"Huh, you got a warrant?"
567,00:35:00,00:35:02,(all chattering)
568,00:35:02,00:35:03,(handcuffs click)
569,00:35:03,00:35:04,What's in the box?
570,00:35:04,00:35:05,Can't you read?
571,00:35:05,00:35:07,Sand. What's it look like?
572,00:35:13,00:35:14,"Sand, huh?"
573,00:35:15,00:35:17,So how much would it run me to fill my tank with blow?
574,00:35:17,00:35:19,Probably what Angela was here to find out.
575,00:35:19,00:35:22,"So Craig Hess sent her to you, didn't he?"
576,00:35:22,00:35:24,We ain't got nothing to say to you.
577,00:35:24,00:35:25,"Right, Joe?"
578,00:35:25,00:35:27,"Well, we've got a tank for both you guys."
579,00:35:27,00:35:28,It's just your size. Come on.
580,00:35:47,00:35:51,There's enough atropine here to sedate all of Sea World.
581,00:37:08,00:37:11,This place is on the garbage truck's route.
582,00:37:11,00:37:13,"There's blood on the table, glass underneath."
583,00:37:13,00:37:21,"Angela came for the cocaine and ended up snorting atropine instead-- pure atropine, which is used to cut coke."
584,00:37:21,00:37:23,(gasping)
585,00:37:24,00:37:25,(grunts)
586,00:37:25,00:37:27,What's that?
587,00:37:27,00:37:31,Angela had blood from two different males in her system.
588,00:37:31,00:37:35,I'm thinking they transfused her Frankenstein-style.
589,00:37:35,00:37:37,Why?
590,00:37:38,00:37:40,Settle the score with Dad?
591,00:37:40,00:37:42,But she came to them.
592,00:37:42,00:37:43,She didn't come for this.
593,00:37:44,00:37:45,MAN: I sell fish.
594,00:37:46,00:37:48,I distribute cocaine.
595,00:37:48,00:37:49,I'm not a murderer.
596,00:37:49,00:37:51,Then why did you kill Angela Carlos?
597,00:37:51,00:38:00,"I didn't. DNA confirms that she received a blood transfusion from you, and your blood type is A-positive."
598,00:38:00,00:38:01,That's what killed her.
599,00:38:03,00:38:06,And now she killed me.
600,00:38:06,00:38:09,"Last year, Angela hooks up with this sports book guy."
601,00:38:09,00:38:12,They get wasted.
602,00:38:12,00:38:13,She totals her car.
603,00:38:13,00:38:15,They walk away without a scratch.
604,00:38:16,00:38:18,"The next day, he's got a bullet through his head."
605,00:38:18,00:38:20,Nobody messes with Daddy's little girl.
606,00:38:21,00:38:24,"The moment she came through my door, I'm a dead man."
607,00:38:24,00:38:27,So you understand why me and Goya would never give her drugs.
608,00:38:27,00:38:29,But you gave her atropine. That'd be stupid.
609,00:38:29,00:38:33,I was going to give her pot out of my own stash.
610,00:38:33,00:38:35,It's not like it's even a real drug.
611,00:38:35,00:38:39,"But when I went to my car to get it, the bitch pulled aPulp Fictionon me."
612,00:38:39,00:38:41,I was cutting the coke before she got there.
613,00:38:41,00:38:45,She decided to help herself and made the wrong choice.
614,00:38:51,00:38:52,(gasps)
615,00:38:52,00:38:55,(glass breaks)
616,00:38:56,00:38:58,Joe calls me in a panic.
617,00:38:58,00:39:01,"When I get there, she still has a pulse."
618,00:39:01,00:39:05,So you don't do the smart thing-- call 911 or dump her at the ER?
619,00:39:05,00:39:10,What made you think a transfusion would wake up Snow White?
620,00:39:10,00:39:11,Keith Richards.
621,00:39:11,00:39:14,The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards?
622,00:39:14,00:39:16,Everyone knows the story.
623,00:39:16,00:39:20,"When he hit the smack too hard, he'd, you know, go to Europe or someplace and get his blood swapped out."
624,00:39:22,00:39:25,That's an urban legend.
625,00:39:25,00:39:26,Whatever.
626,00:39:26,00:39:28,It makes sense.
627,00:39:28,00:39:30,And I know about tubes and pumps.
628,00:39:30,00:39:32,"That's all a transfusion is, right?"
629,00:39:32,00:39:33,"GOYA: She can't die, man."
630,00:39:34,00:39:35,"It's okay, it's okay."
631,00:39:35,00:39:36,"Look, I got it."
632,00:39:37,00:39:39,"Come on, man. Come on."
633,00:39:39,00:39:41,"Okay, all right, all right, now we give her our blood."
634,00:39:41,00:39:42,We're freaking losing her.
635,00:39:42,00:39:43,Let's go. (Angela breathing)
636,00:39:43,00:39:45,"No, no, it's okay."
637,00:39:45,00:39:47,"Here you go, man. Take this."
638,00:39:47,00:39:49,(Goya groans)
639,00:39:49,00:39:51,"Leave it in there, man. Leave it in there."
640,00:39:54,00:39:56,GOYA: We were trying to save her.
641,00:39:57,00:39:58,She died anyway.
642,00:39:58,00:40:00,"Yeah, she died."
643,00:40:00,00:40:04,But then you drove her body halfway across town and threw her in a Dumpster.
644,00:40:04,00:40:07,Not any Dumpster.
645,00:40:07,00:40:09,That bastard Hess.
646,00:40:09,00:40:13,"He sent her to our house, so we gave her back to him."
647,00:40:13,00:40:14,(indistinct yelling)
648,00:40:14,00:40:16,I could just guess what he told her.
649,00:40:16,00:40:19,Your father's boys will take care of you.
650,00:40:19,00:40:22,Goya's Aquariums-- Corville Street.
651,00:40:24,00:40:25,But she wasn't in his Dumpster.
652,00:40:25,00:40:32,But it was close enough to Hess' club that Mr. Carlos would make the connection.
653,00:40:32,00:40:33,Blame Hess.
654,00:40:33,00:40:36,I do.
655,00:40:36,00:40:38,(distant siren wailing)
656,00:40:45,00:40:48,(phone ringing)
657,00:40:48,00:40:49,(Hank whimpers)
658,00:40:49,00:40:51,(Grissom sighs)
659,00:40:53,00:40:55,(ringing continues)
660,00:41:04,00:41:06,Grissom.
661,00:41:06,00:41:08,(sighs)
662,00:41:08,00:41:10,"(Death Cab for Cutie's ""Pity and Fear"" fading in)"
663,00:42:19,00:42:21,(song ends)
