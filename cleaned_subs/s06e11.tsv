0	00:00:13	00:00:15	LVPD. Officer Mularz.
1	00:00:15	00:00:17	May I help you?
2	00:00:18	00:00:20	Is there somebody there?
3	00:00:20	00:00:24	I'd like to report a murder.
4	00:00:26	00:00:27	Your name?
5	00:00:28	00:00:29	Hello?
6	00:00:29	00:00:30	Is there somebody there?
7	00:00:30	00:00:41	The body can be found at 1812 White Oak Road.
8	00:00:41	00:00:44	I'd like to help you. Please identify yourself.
9	00:00:47	00:00:51	Send someone to pick up the body.
10	00:01:02	00:01:07	So an anonymous call came into metro about an hour ago.
11	00:01:07	00:01:09	Investigating officer found the dead body.
12	00:01:09	00:01:10	The coroner's inside.
13	00:01:12	00:01:15	The, uh... the door was open.
14	00:01:15	00:01:17	Unlocked.
15	00:01:18	00:01:23	So the house is owned by the decedent, Hayden Bradford.
16	00:01:23	00:01:26	Neighbor says he lives alone.
17	00:01:26	00:01:29	The floor is covered in hair.
18	00:01:29	00:01:31	Has he got a cat or a dog?
19	00:01:31	00:01:32	Nope.
20	00:01:33	00:01:36	But as you can see our dead guy is...
21	00:01:37	00:01:39	I guess you could say he's hirsute.
22	00:01:39	00:01:41	Hirsute is an understatement.
23	00:01:41	00:01:43	It's like he's wearing a pelt.
24	00:02:01	00:02:04	Hey, David, would you grab that?
25	00:02:10	00:02:11	Thanks.
26	00:02:13	00:02:16	A missed call from a Michelle.
27	00:02:16	00:02:21	She called six times 53 p.m.
28	00:02:21	00:02:23	Liver temp's 80 degrees.
29	00:02:23	00:02:25	Been dead around 12 hours.
30	00:02:25	00:02:27	00 p.m.
31	00:02:27	00:02:30	Explains why he didn't take her calls.
32	00:02:30	00:02:34	C.O.D.-- bullet to the chest.
33	00:02:36	00:02:39	These strands are smooth, not coarse.
34	00:02:39	00:02:40	They're human.
35	00:02:40	00:02:42	Are the roots intact?
36	00:02:42	00:02:43	Yeah.
37	00:02:46	00:02:48	Evidently, this guy was shedding.
38	00:03:29	00:03:31	Hey, Dave, James.
39	00:03:32	00:03:35	Hey, Dave, you've got to pick it up.
40	00:03:35	00:03:38	Lift with the knees, Super Dave, lift with the knees. Yeah.
41	00:03:38	00:03:40	Thanks, I... have done this before.
42	00:03:42	00:03:44	Hey.
43	00:03:44	00:03:47	So, Brass gave us a quick briefing.
44	00:03:47	00:03:48	How can we help?
45	00:03:48	00:03:50	Warrick and I are processing the interior, room to room.
46	00:03:50	00:03:52	So that leaves the perimeter.
47	00:03:52	00:03:54	Thanks.
48	00:04:02	00:04:05	Well, this victim definitely had a lady in his life.
49	00:04:05	00:04:06	That's odd.
50	00:04:06	00:04:10	There is not a single feminine touch in this house.
51	00:04:17	00:04:18	Michelle.
52	00:04:18	00:04:20	Christmas, 2004.
53	00:04:20	00:04:23	It's got to be the same Michelle that tried to reach him six times on his cell phone.
54	00:04:39	00:04:42	Broken window.
55	00:04:49	00:04:50	Yeah.
56	00:04:50	00:04:52	It slides.
57	00:04:52	00:04:55	The front door was locked.
58	00:04:55	00:04:57	The killer probably broke the window and exited out the front.
59	00:04:59	00:05:01	I'll need to print the window, but, uh...
60	00:05:01	00:05:03	why don't we get to this first.
61	00:05:06	00:05:08	Doesn't look big enough to have done the job.
62	00:05:26	00:05:28	We have a print.
63	00:05:57	00:06:01	Hey, Jackass-- this is your last chance.
64	00:06:01	00:06:03	Pay your debt or I'll hunt you down.
65	00:06:03	00:06:09	Makes our job easier when the suspect prints out his motive.
66	00:06:09	00:06:18	He has an e-mail printout from CasinoDan@gmail.com to Misterbradford@gmail.com.
67	00:06:18	00:06:22	Well, that ain't no anthill.
68	00:06:23	00:06:24	That dirt's fresh.
69	00:06:24	00:06:28	Looks like something's buried there.
70	00:06:39	00:06:41	Oh, my God...!
71	00:06:41	00:06:42	.32 Beretta.
72	00:06:42	00:06:44	Victim was shot, right?
73	00:06:44	00:06:47	It's going to be hard to get a print, but I'll get it to ballistics.
74	00:06:50	00:06:52	Well, we knew he was hairy.
75	00:06:52	00:06:54	I didn't realize the full extent.
76	00:06:54	00:06:56	Hypertrichosis.
77	00:06:56	00:06:58	I've only read about it.
78	00:06:58	00:07:00	Excessive hair growth.
79	00:07:00	00:07:02	Genetic. Extremely rare.
80	00:07:02	00:07:04	His case was relatively mild.
81	00:07:04	00:07:08	In some individuals, hair grows everywhere except the eyes and the mouth.
82	00:07:08	00:07:09	The human werewolf syndrome.
83	00:07:10	00:07:14	In Mexico, there's a family 30 members are afflicted.
84	00:07:14	00:07:17	Two of the teen boys were recently adopted by the national circus.
85	00:07:17	00:07:24	Great. The bearded lady, the dog-faced boy-- Physical deformities as family entertainment.
86	00:07:24	00:07:25	I cleared a path for the bullet.
87	00:07:29	00:07:34	I figured you'd want to get this to ballistics ASAP.
88	00:07:34	00:07:35	Thanks, Al.
89	00:07:35	00:07:42	You know, Gil, we're all intrigued by our nightmares, and when we watch freak shows, basically we're all thinking the same thing.
90	00:07:42	00:07:45	Yeah, I'm glad they're not looking at me.
91	00:07:45	00:07:47	Hey, Archie. Hey.
92	00:07:47	00:07:49	Please tell me you've I.D.'d Casino Dan.
93	00:07:49	00:07:56	Yep. The ISP provider sent over the subscriber information for a CasinoDan@gmail.com.
94	00:07:56	00:07:59	It's registered to a Dan Nobler, who runs a gambling Web site.
95	00:07:59	00:08:02	If I wanted to visit Dan in person, where would I go?
96	00:08:02	00:08:08	Well, the server for CasinoDan.com is in Argentina, which allows him to skirt U.S. gaming laws.
97	00:08:08	00:08:11	However, he's got a Nevada business license.
98	00:08:11	00:08:13	And I have the address.
99	00:08:15	00:08:17	Anything else I should know?
100	00:08:17	00:08:23	Uh, well, I don't know if it's relevant, but he recently opened an account with Peopledectors.com.
101	00:08:23	00:08:24	Who was he looking for? I don't know.
102	00:08:25	00:08:26	I'll triage the computer's hard drive.
103	00:08:26	00:08:27	Reconstruct the deleted e-mails.
104	00:08:27	00:08:30	I'll get back to you on that.
105	00:08:31	00:08:33	Can I help you?
106	00:08:33	00:08:35	You Dan Nobler?
107	00:08:35	00:08:36	Yeah.
108	00:08:36	00:08:38	We're from the crime lab.
109	00:08:38	00:08:39	We need to ask you a few questions.
110	00:08:39	00:08:42	Look, if you're here about my business, you can save it for my attorney.
111	00:08:42	00:08:45	No, actually we're inquiring about a Mr. Hayden Bradford.
112	00:08:45	00:08:49	You sent him some threatening e-mails.
113	00:08:49	00:08:51	Bradford is a lying son of a bitch.
114	00:08:51	00:08:53	Care to elaborate on that?
115	00:08:53	00:08:54	I run an online gambling business.
116	00:08:54	00:08:58	Bradford had an account, ran up $10,000 in debt and refused to pay.
117	00:08:58	00:09:03	Isn't it true in online gambling you have to submit your credit card, prior to gambling, to insure your losses?
118	00:09:03	00:09:05	That's true.
119	00:09:05	00:09:07	And when Bradford was winning, it wasn't a problem.
120	00:09:07	00:09:11	But when his luck changed, he called his credit card holder and said the charges were fraudulent.
121	00:09:11	00:09:14	The credit card company issued a charge back and I got screwed.
122	00:09:14	00:09:16	Is that when you decided to hunt him down?
123	00:09:16	00:09:21	Look, I wrote him an e-mail hoping to scare him.
124	00:09:21	00:09:24	Sorry. I was angry.
125	00:09:24	00:09:27	If I write an apology, can we drop this?
126	00:09:27	00:09:29	No, Mr. Nobler, I'm sorry, we can't do that.
127	00:09:29	00:09:31	Mr. Bradford's dead.
128	00:09:35	00:09:37	Any other questions, contact my lawyer.
129	00:09:38	00:09:39	We're done here.
130	00:09:45	00:09:46	You see that?
131	00:09:46	00:09:48	Yeah, the guy's a jerk.
132	00:09:48	00:09:51	No, he wiped his feet on the mat.
133	00:09:54	00:09:57	I'm hoping to get a little trace evidence here.
134	00:09:59	00:10:01	Yeah, you see these pebbles?
135	00:10:01	00:10:04	They look like the same ones that were found at the crime scene.
136	00:10:21	00:10:22	Fire in the hole!
137	00:10:49	00:10:50	Bobby.
138	00:10:50	00:10:51	Hey.
139	00:10:51	00:10:57	So, that, uh, buried gun y'all recovered, wasn't used to kill Bradford.
140	00:10:57	00:11:01	GRCs aren't even close.
141	00:11:01	00:11:06	Most bullets are copper, but take a look at the fatal bullet.
142	00:11:06	00:11:09	It's silver.
143	00:11:11	00:11:14	How do you kill a werewolf?
144	00:11:21	00:11:22	No one's home.
145	00:11:22	00:11:24	We want to see the wolfman.
146	00:11:24	00:11:25	Yeah, well, he's not available right now.
147	00:11:25	00:11:29	I am trying to prep him for autopsy. Wow.
148	00:11:29	00:11:31	And I thought Robin Williams had hairy arms.
149	00:11:31	00:11:32	Can I touch him?
150	00:11:32	00:11:33	You mean pet him.
151	00:11:33	00:11:34	No!
152	00:11:34	00:11:36	You may not touch or pet the decedent.
153	00:11:36	00:11:38	Is it soft like fur or...?
154	00:11:38	00:11:40	I was supposed to have him prepped hours ago.
155	00:11:40	00:11:41	Please. Okay, you guys gotta go.
156	00:11:41	00:11:44	Relax, Dave. It's not every day that Chaka ends up on a slab.
157	00:11:44	00:11:45	Yeah, I need you to leave.
158	00:11:45	00:11:46	Whoa.
159	00:11:46	00:11:52	Fine, but if I get a sleestak in my lab, and you want to see it, I'm gonna get cranky.
160	00:11:52	00:11:54	Mr. Moyer, you're here about Hayden Bradford.
161	00:11:54	00:11:56	Do you know him?
162	00:11:56	00:11:58	Of course.
163	00:11:58	00:11:59	He's one of my closest friends.
164	00:11:59	00:12:02	Yeah... Yeah, I'm sorry. We found his body this morning.
165	00:12:02	00:12:07	You didn't recently try to break in his home...
166	00:12:07	00:12:10	did you?
167	00:12:10	00:12:11	Excuse me. What?
168	00:12:11	00:12:16	We found a rock by a broken window, With your fingerprint on it.
169	00:12:17	00:12:19	Is that funny?
170	00:12:19	00:12:20	No. It's just. uh...
171	00:12:20	00:12:22	last week we were playing toss with a ball.
172	00:12:26	00:12:28	That still doesn't explain to me how your fingerprint got there.
173	00:12:30	00:12:33	There was glass everywhere, so I knocked out the loose pieces.
174	00:12:33	00:12:35	You guys being good friends...
175	00:12:35	00:12:38	you were aware of his medical condition, right?
176	00:12:38	00:12:40	That he was a hairy S.O.B.?
177	00:12:40	00:12:43	Yeah. Of course. Why?
178	00:12:43	00:12:45	Do you know why anybody'd want to hurt him?
179	00:12:45	00:12:48	He's a friendly, quiet guy.
180	00:12:48	00:12:50	I've known him since high school.
181	00:12:50	00:12:51	He's been dating my sister.
182	00:12:55	00:12:56	Oh, God.
183	00:12:56	00:12:58	She doesn't know yet, does she?
184	00:12:58	00:13:00	Who, Michelle?
185	00:13:00	00:13:02	Yeah.
186	00:13:02	00:13:05	I tried to call her cell phone and...
187	00:13:05	00:13:07	She's at my parents, in Pahrump.
188	00:13:07	00:13:09	Her cell's probably out of range.
189	00:13:09	00:13:13	But you can get me their home number, address, all that?
190	00:13:13	00:13:14	Sure.
191	00:13:14	00:13:17	But if it's okay, I'd...
192	00:13:17	00:13:20	I should break the news to her in person.
193	00:13:20	00:13:22	I've been waiting for you.
194	00:13:23	00:13:25	Sorry. I headed out as soon as I got your page.
195	00:13:25	00:13:28	Really? 'Cause, uh...
196	00:13:28	00:13:31	I left a voicemail several hours ago.
197	00:13:31	00:13:32	What's up?
198	00:13:32	00:13:37	The anonymous call was traced to this phone booth, so I figured you'd want to process.
199	00:13:40	00:13:43	There is fingerprint powder on the phone.
200	00:13:43	00:13:44	Yeah, I got bored waiting.
201	00:13:44	00:13:46	I thought you might need some help.
202	00:13:46	00:13:49	No usable prints, but check out the floor.
203	00:13:53	00:13:55	There's a lot of hair.
204	00:13:55	00:13:57	Similar to the crime scene.
205	00:13:57	00:14:00	The victim was killed 12 hours before this call was made.
206	00:14:00	00:14:04	If that's his hair, what's it doing here?
207	00:14:06	00:14:07	The hair isn't Hayden's.
208	00:14:07	00:14:09	The chromosomes are XX.
209	00:14:09	00:14:10	Female. Yeah.
210	00:14:10	00:14:13	So I took the liberty of comparing the sample's DNA to the victim's DNA.
211	00:14:13	00:14:16	There are seven alleles in common.
212	00:14:16	00:14:17	Brother and sister.
213	00:14:17	00:14:18	Mm-hmm.
214	00:14:18	00:14:20	She's likely our anonymous caller.
215	00:14:20	00:14:25	Yeah, well, given the amount of hair that you collected, she's also probably a very hairy woman.
216	00:14:27	00:14:29	Wendy, can you do me a favor? Hmm?
217	00:14:29	00:14:35	Can you see if any of the follicles from the crime scene are a match to the hairs from the phone booth?
218	00:14:35	00:14:37	You want to see if the sister was in the victim's house.
219	00:14:38	00:14:42	If she was, she's not just the caller, she's a suspect.
220	00:14:43	00:14:44	I hear the vic has a sister.
221	00:14:44	00:14:46	A twin sister, in fact.
222	00:14:46	00:14:48	I tracked down the victim's birth certificate.
223	00:14:48	00:14:50	He was born to a Rita Bradford in Fresno, California.
224	00:14:51	00:14:54	Ms. Bradford apparently had twins, Hayden and Allison.
225	00:14:54	00:14:56	There's no record of any other children.
226	00:14:56	00:14:58	I'm assuming you contacted Allison.
227	00:14:58	00:14:59	Well, that's where it gets odd.
228	00:14:59	00:15:04	Allison Bradford has never filed with the IRS, has never had a driver's license, has never filled out a W-2.
229	00:15:04	00:15:07	How do you go through life without a paper trail?
230	00:15:07	00:15:08	She's dead.
231	00:15:08	00:15:10	There's no record of a death certificate.
232	00:15:10	00:15:13	We found her hair in the phone booth.
233	00:15:13	00:15:18	And DNA just confirmed that some of the hair follicles that we collected at the crime scene are hers.
234	00:15:18	00:15:23	Well, other than hair, when you and Warrick processed the house, did you find any evidence of a sister?
235	00:15:23	00:15:26	No, but we were not looking for one.
236	00:15:26	00:15:27	We are now.
237	00:16:15	00:16:17	Catherine, I've covered the kitchen.
238	00:16:17	00:16:20	I've found no evidence of a sister living here.
239	00:16:20	00:16:21	Ditto for the bedroom.
240	00:16:21	00:16:23	I think I'm gonna take a look outside.
241	00:16:23	00:16:24	I'll do the same.
242	00:16:24	00:16:27	Thanks, guys.
243	00:17:02	00:17:04	Please go away.
244	00:17:09	00:17:11	Allison?
245	00:17:11	00:17:12	This is my home.
246	00:17:12	00:17:14	I would like you to leave.
247	00:17:14	00:17:15	Allison...
248	00:17:17	00:17:19	I need to talk with you.
249	00:17:19	00:17:21	Can you please come out?
250	00:17:21	00:17:23	I'd rather not.
251	00:17:23	00:17:25	Allison, my name is Catherine Willows.
252	00:17:25	00:17:29	I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.
253	00:17:29	00:17:33	I know that you suffer from hypertrichosis.
254	00:17:33	00:17:36	I understand why you would rather not talk with me.
255	00:17:38	00:17:40	But we need to discuss your brother's murder.
256	00:17:43	00:17:44	Would you please come out?
257	00:17:56	00:17:56	May I...?
258	00:17:58	00:18:01	Would you step out? Please?
259	00:18:01	00:18:04	You want to see what I look like?
260	00:18:04	00:18:06	No, I... No.
261	00:18:08	00:18:10	I don't want you to have to hide from me.
262	00:18:10	00:18:13	Allison...
263	00:18:13	00:18:14	I'm a scientist.
264	00:18:18	00:18:22	Excess body hair does not evoke fear...
265	00:18:22	00:18:24	or morbid fascination.
266	00:18:27	00:18:31	It's simply a genetic quirk, like...
267	00:18:31	00:18:33	blue eyes or flat feet.
268	00:18:49	00:18:51	It's nice to meet you, Allison.
269	00:18:58	00:19:00	How can I help you, Ms. Willows?
270	00:19:08	00:19:10	What can you tell me about your brother's murder?
271	00:19:10	00:19:16	No one knows I live here, so when we get a visitor, I go to my room.
272	00:19:17	00:19:22	30, the doorbell rang.
273	00:19:23	00:19:24	Just a sec!
274	00:19:27	00:19:31	And when I came out of my room, Hayden was dead.
275	00:19:31	00:19:34	Why did you wait 12 hours to call the police?
276	00:19:34	00:19:40	Because I didn't want the call traced to the house, back to me, so...
277	00:19:40	00:19:48	I waited till midnight, and then I walked to a pay phone.
278	00:19:48	00:19:51	You weren't supposed to find me.
279	00:19:51	00:19:54	Do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt your brother?
280	00:19:55	00:19:57	No.
281	00:19:59	00:20:02	He was my only friend.
282	00:20:03	00:20:07	He was my connection to the outside world.
283	00:20:08	00:20:10	What about your parents?
284	00:20:10	00:20:12	I never knew my father.
285	00:20:13	00:20:15	My mother died when we were teenagers.
286	00:20:16	00:20:18	No one else knows that you exist?
287	00:20:19	00:20:23	I hope... I hope you'll help me.
288	00:20:23	00:20:25	Help you-- with what?
289	00:20:25	00:20:30	Staying secret.
290	00:20:30	00:20:32	It's best for everyone.
291	00:20:40	00:20:42	Hey, Grissom, you got a second?
292	00:20:42	00:20:51	Did you know the word werewolf was derived from the Old English word wargwolf, which is a synonym for serial killer?
293	00:20:51	00:20:52	No, I didn't.
294	00:20:52	00:20:57	Imagine if you had some deep, dark secret...
295	00:20:57	00:20:59	something that brought you tremendous shame.
296	00:21:00	00:21:07	but instead of being able to hide it away, you had to wear it out on your skin, so that the first time anyone saw you, they saw your secret.
297	00:21:07	00:21:09	You talking about Allison?
298	00:21:09	00:21:10	Yeah.
299	00:21:10	00:21:14	Catherine said she's scared to death of people and what they'll think of her.
300	00:21:14	00:21:21	Well, if that's the case, why not try electrolysis or depilatory lasers?
301	00:21:21	00:21:25	With that much hair-- be a lot of scarring, and a great deal of pain.
302	00:21:25	00:21:27	Plus, imagine how expensive it would be.
303	00:21:27	00:21:28	What have you got?
304	00:21:29	00:21:30	Well, I just ran into Archie.
305	00:21:30	00:21:34	The decedent used a company called peopledetectors.com to try to locate his mother.
306	00:21:34	00:21:35	Catherine spoke to Allison.
307	00:21:35	00:21:37	Their mother's dead.
308	00:21:37	00:21:39	Apparently not.
309	00:21:39	00:21:44	She's alive and well, and has an address in Henderson, so I'm gonna go out there, check it out.
310	00:21:44	00:21:46	Hey, Nick. Yeah.
311	00:21:46	00:21:47	Bring her back here, will you?
312	00:21:48	00:21:49	Sure. Why?
313	00:21:49	00:21:51	I want to talk to her.
314	00:21:51	00:21:54	Find out why a mother would play dead.
315	00:21:54	00:21:56	Oh, good, you're here.
316	00:21:56	00:21:57	I love an audience.
317	00:21:57	00:21:59	Well, don't expect any applause.
318	00:22:00	00:22:02	What do you got?
319	00:22:02	00:22:06	I compared pebbles from the crime scene to the pebbles from Dan Nobler's doormat.
320	00:22:07	00:22:10	They're consistent with each other-- a composite commonly known as pea gravel.
321	00:22:10	00:22:14	The pebbles weren't the only trace elements I found in that doormat.
322	00:22:14	00:22:17	I also found several slivers of glass...
323	00:22:17	00:22:20	glass consistent with a broken window.
324	00:22:20	00:22:22	I'm here about pebbles and glass.
325	00:22:22	00:22:24	Come on.
326	00:22:24	00:22:25	Look, this is ridiculous.
327	00:22:25	00:22:28	I mean, we're talking about trace evidence on a doormat?
328	00:22:28	00:22:29	Come on.
329	00:22:29	00:22:31	Besides, I read the file.
330	00:22:31	00:22:34	A guy named Brent Moyer already admitted to breaking the window.
331	00:22:34	00:22:36	This is true; he did.
332	00:22:36	00:22:40	But we believe that Mr. Nobler here stepped in the shards of glass.
333	00:22:40	00:22:46	Listen, neither the glass nor the pebbles are probative on their own, but together, they put your client at the crime scene.
334	00:22:46	00:22:50	Not to mention, his threatening e-mail gives us motive.
335	00:22:50	00:22:52	Fine. I was there. Dan...
336	00:22:52	00:22:54	No, look, I get ripped off by jerks all over the world.
337	00:22:54	00:22:56	This guy was a local.
338	00:22:56	00:22:58	I knew his address and, yeah, I wanted to shake him down.
339	00:22:58	00:23:02	Let him know that by declaring credit card fraud, he was stealing from me.
340	00:23:02	00:23:05	Okay, I'm listening.
341	00:23:05	00:23:10	A few days ago, I went over to his house.
342	00:23:10	00:23:13	Then I started thinking, What if this guy's like twice my size?
343	00:23:13	00:23:19	I figured I should get a look at him before I had our conversation, so I went around back...
344	00:23:31	00:23:33	Hey...
345	00:23:33	00:23:34	Hey, hey!
346	00:23:35	00:23:43	At first, I thought he was wearing a costume, but then I realized, it was... it was real hair.
347	00:23:43	00:23:44	Disgusting, right?
348	00:23:44	00:23:47	What happened next?
349	00:23:47	00:23:49	Well, when the dude saw me, I took off.
350	00:23:49	00:23:51	Why?
351	00:23:51	00:23:55	Uh, he was a freak of nature.
352	00:23:55	00:23:58	I no longer wish to speak with him.
353	00:24:56	00:24:58	Hey, man.
354	00:24:58	00:24:59	Hey.
355	00:24:59	00:25:01	What are you smiling about?
356	00:25:01	00:25:05	Oh, I was just thinking of The Howling II; the werewolf bitch.
357	00:25:05	00:25:06	I don't care what anyone says.
358	00:25:06	00:25:07	It was much better than the first one.
359	00:25:07	00:25:09	Is it? Yeah, yeah.
360	00:25:09	00:25:10	I got the whole anthology.
361	00:25:10	00:25:11	Want to borrow it?
362	00:25:11	00:25:15	No, thanks. I would like to know about my bullet, however.
363	00:25:15	00:25:18	I assume it was homemade since the manufacturer doesn't sell it in silver.
364	00:25:18	00:25:19	Right. Simple clamshell mold.
365	00:25:25	00:25:29	92.5% pure with trace amounts of copper, nickel and chromium lead.
366	00:25:29	00:25:33	Elemental properties are consistent with sterling silver jewelry.
367	00:25:33	00:25:36	And sterling silver has a high melting point.
368	00:25:36	00:25:38	Someone went through a lot of trouble to make it.
369	00:25:38	00:25:41	Sorry I didn't get here sooner.
370	00:25:41	00:25:43	I was pretty upset.
371	00:25:43	00:25:47	Michelle, your relationship with Hayden, was it serious?
372	00:25:47	00:25:50	We were engaged.
373	00:25:50	00:25:52	I can't believe he's gone.
374	00:25:52	00:25:56	The day he died, you called him six times.
375	00:25:56	00:26:00	There was a golf tournament on ESPN that night.
376	00:26:00	00:26:03	He wanted me to tape it for him.
377	00:26:03	00:26:10	I was trying to reach him because I was at my folks' place and the VCR was broken.
378	00:26:10	00:26:14	Sounds so silly now.
379	00:26:14	00:26:19	I'd like to see him... to say good-bye.
380	00:26:21	00:26:24	He's with the coroner.
381	00:26:27	00:26:35	Michelle, I understand that you were at your folks and you were trying to get ahold of Hayden on your cell, but we were unable to reach you on it.
382	00:26:35	00:26:36	Can you explain?
383	00:26:36	00:26:40	I called Hayden so many times that my battery died.
384	00:26:40	00:26:42	I'm sorry.
385	00:26:42	00:26:44	Do you have any idea who could have done this?
386	00:26:46	00:26:49	You know about his condition, right?
387	00:26:49	00:26:53	It made him really sweet.
388	00:26:53	00:27:00	I mean, it was like he was constantly trying to make up for his physical imperfections by doing everything perfectly.
389	00:27:00	00:27:09	He was the perfect boyfriend, the perfect lover, my best friend.
390	00:27:11	00:27:15	I don't know what I'm going to do without him.
391	00:27:18	00:27:22	I was in labor for 27 hours.
392	00:27:23	00:27:26	They didn't want to come out.
393	00:27:26	00:27:28	Who could blame 'em.
394	00:27:28	00:27:30	Mrs. Bradford, why does Allison think you're dead?
395	00:27:30	00:27:33	I thought it would be easier.
396	00:27:33	00:27:36	Easier than what?
397	00:27:36	00:27:40	I did the best I could, Mr. Grissom.
398	00:27:40	00:27:43	Their father couldn't look at 'em.
399	00:27:43	00:27:45	Took off when they were a few weeks old.
400	00:27:45	00:27:47	Babies are supposed to be cute.
401	00:27:49	00:27:53	Mrs. Bradford...?
402	00:27:53	00:27:57	At the time, we were living in Fresno.
403	00:27:57	00:28:00	Family, friends stopped visiting.
404	00:28:00	00:28:02	They were scared of my children.
405	00:28:02	00:28:05	Especially Allison. She... she looked like...
406	00:28:08	00:28:13	When she started nursery school, the kids teased her, called her names, made her cry.
407	00:28:13	00:28:17	So you moved to Vegas and decided to keep her a secret?
408	00:28:18	00:28:21	It was best for everyone.
409	00:28:21	00:28:28	But she became completely dependent on me, and for 18 years, I took care of her.
410	00:28:28	00:28:32	I'm sorry, but I still don't understand why she believes you're dead.
411	00:28:32	00:28:39	One day, Allison wanted to take a walk... outside.
412	00:28:39	00:28:42	I didn't want anyone to see her.
413	00:28:42	00:28:52	We had a fight. I locked her in her room-- my own child-- because she wanted fresh air.
414	00:28:55	00:28:58	At that moment, I knew I needed to leave.
415	00:28:59	00:29:02	I told Hayden to tell her I was in a car accident.
416	00:29:02	00:29:06	Two days later, he put on a black suit, told her he was going to my funeral.
417	00:29:06	00:29:10	And she didn't go because she couldn't leave the house.
418	00:29:13	00:29:19	You thought it would be easier for her to accept your death than your abandonment?
419	00:29:19	00:29:23	Please don't judge me.
420	00:29:23	00:29:25	I spend enough time doing that.
421	00:29:25	00:29:28	I'm just trying to find out who killed your son.
422	00:29:30	00:29:33	I haven't seen either of them for seven years.
423	00:29:33	00:29:35	I wouldn't have any idea.
424	00:29:35	00:29:41	You know, Mrs. Bradford, your daughter's all alone now.
425	00:29:41	00:29:43	It's not too late for you to go back to her.
426	00:29:43	00:29:47	And tell her what?
427	00:29:47	00:29:50	That I faked my death to escape from her?
428	00:29:53	00:29:56	How do you say that to your own flesh and blood?
429	00:30:05	00:30:07	What's up with the 911?
430	00:30:07	00:30:12	David didn't notice the victim's lividity at the crime scene because it was obscured by his body hair.
431	00:30:12	00:30:14	But when we shaved him...
432	00:30:14	00:30:16	Well, check out his left side.
433	00:30:16	00:30:19	So it was on his side where the blood settled.
434	00:30:19	00:30:22	Correct, but he was found faceup.
435	00:30:28	00:30:31	So, uh, somebody moved him several hours postmortem.
436	00:30:31	00:30:32	There's more.
437	00:30:32	00:30:40	Vic was found on a hardwood floor, but when David brushed his body hair for trace, he found blue carpet fibers.
438	00:30:43	00:30:46	Well, there was blue carpet in the sister's room.
439	00:30:50	00:30:55	Hayden was shot through the chest, it would have exsanguinated on impact.
440	00:30:55	00:30:57	Any blood in the sister's room?
441	00:30:57	00:31:00	I'll get back to you on that one.
442	00:31:08	00:31:12	Allison, it's Catherine.
443	00:31:12	00:31:14	I need you to step out.
444	00:31:15	00:31:17	Who else is there?
445	00:31:18	00:31:19	There's another woman with me.
446	00:31:19	00:31:23	Allison, I'm Detective Curtis.
447	00:31:31	00:31:33	I need to get inside your room.
448	00:31:37	00:31:38	Thank you.
449	00:33:32	00:33:36	I don't know anything about it.
450	00:33:36	00:33:43	You can't expect us to believe that you live in a secret room that only you go into, yet you can't explain why your bed is covering up blood.
451	00:33:45	00:33:47	Did you kill him?
452	00:33:47	00:33:50	What?!
453	00:33:50	00:33:51	Did you?
454	00:33:51	00:33:54	Hayden's all I had.
455	00:33:54	00:33:57	He's the only one that knew about me.
456	00:33:57	00:33:58	Why would I kill him?
457	00:33:58	00:34:00	Because he was going to leave you...
458	00:34:00	00:34:01	for Michelle.
459	00:34:01	00:34:04	That had to have been scary for you.
460	00:34:04	00:34:06	You think I'm some sort of animal?
461	00:34:06	00:34:09	I wanted him to be happy.
462	00:34:09	00:34:12	I loved Hayden, I wanted him to be happy.
463	00:34:12	00:34:14	Did Michelle know about you?
464	00:34:14	00:34:22	No, but he said that he was going to tell her and that she was going to move in here and she would accept me-- Hayden promised.
465	00:34:22	00:34:25	Allison...
466	00:34:25	00:34:29	if you didn't kill him, who did?
467	00:34:32	00:34:33	Okay, I'm sorry.
468	00:34:33	00:34:35	We can do this here or we can take this downtown.
469	00:34:35	00:34:37	No, please.
470	00:34:37	00:34:39	Please.
471	00:34:39	00:34:41	I know that you're scared...
472	00:34:41	00:34:44	but you have got to tell us what happened.
473	00:34:46	00:34:48	The doorbell rang.
474	00:34:48	00:34:50	I went into my room.
475	00:34:51	00:34:52	Allison, where's the gun?
476	00:34:52	00:34:54	I... I...
477	00:34:54	00:34:55	Damn it, Allison, where's the gun?
478	00:34:58	00:35:00	And when he was shot, what did you do?
479	00:35:00	00:35:02	I hid.
480	00:35:02	00:35:04	Behind the door.
481	00:35:17	00:35:18	Was the television on?
482	00:35:18	00:35:20	No. It's busted.
483	00:35:20	00:35:22	It hasn't worked in years.
484	00:35:22	00:35:28	So you had a pretty good view of the living room through the reflection in the tube.
485	00:35:28	00:35:30	What did you see?
486	00:35:44	00:35:47	Freak.
487	00:35:48	00:35:51	You're sure that it was Brent?
488	00:35:51	00:35:53	I've seen him through the peephole.
489	00:35:53	00:35:54	They were best friends.
490	00:35:54	00:35:56	Okay, um...
491	00:35:56	00:35:57	let's just go back to the gun.
492	00:35:57	00:36:04	A couple of days ago, Hayden said he saw a guy sneaking around the back.
493	00:36:04	00:36:06	So he bought me a gun for safety.
494	00:36:06	00:36:12	But I don't like guns so... I just buried it in the backyard.
495	00:36:12	00:36:15	Yes, we found it.
496	00:36:15	00:36:16	Allison...
497	00:36:16	00:36:20	why was it so difficult for you to tell us the truth?
498	00:36:20	00:36:26	I think you're going to make me testify and I won't do that.
499	00:36:26	00:36:31	I want Brent to go to jail, but I won't be the sideshow freak.
500	00:36:31	00:36:36	Well, we can try to build a case without you.
501	00:36:36	00:36:39	You can't get a warrant unless she goes on record.
502	00:36:39	00:36:40	Well, just hear me out.
503	00:36:40	00:36:43	We have a rock with Brent Moyer's fingerprints on it.
504	00:36:43	00:36:46	Yeah, but Allison told you that Brent entered through the front door.
505	00:36:46	00:36:47	The rock is extraneous evidence, isn't it?
506	00:36:47	00:36:49	Well, let's just leave Allison's testimony out of it.
507	00:36:49	00:36:56	We simply inform the judge that our suspect's fingerprints were on a rock that may have been used to break a window at the murder scene.
508	00:36:56	00:36:59	If you have no qualms about filing the petition, then file it.
509	00:36:59	00:37:01	Oh, no, I don't have any qualms.
510	00:37:01	00:37:05	It's just that my moral compass doesn't always point in the same direction as yours.
511	00:37:05	00:37:07	So if I tell you not to file it, you won't?
512	00:37:07	00:37:09	I'd take it under advisement.
513	00:37:09	00:37:10	Why, is that what you're recommending?
514	00:37:10	00:37:14	How many times have we been prevented from getting a warrant when we knew we had the right guy?
515	00:37:14	00:37:15	Way too many. Right.
516	00:37:15	00:37:18	So rock and roll.
517	00:37:27	00:37:29	Las Vegas PD. We have a search warrant.
518	00:37:31	00:37:32	What's going on?
519	00:37:32	00:37:34	Please step outside.
520	00:38:21	00:38:24	Why would I kill my best friend?
521	00:38:24	00:38:27	That's a very good question.
522	00:38:27	00:38:33	A bullet clamshell isn't enough for the DA to file.
523	00:38:33	00:38:35	What am I missing here?
524	00:38:35	00:38:40	Our trace lab analyzed the silver found in the bullet mold.
525	00:38:40	00:38:44	It's identical composition to the bullet in the victim.
526	00:38:44	00:38:47	DA says it's a slam dunk.
527	00:38:47	00:38:50	Hayden was going to marry my sister.
528	00:38:50	00:38:51	Brent, I recommend that...
529	00:38:53	00:38:56	I couldn't let that happen.
530	00:38:56	00:38:58	He was diseased.
531	00:38:58	00:39:00	Wasn't a problem for me.
532	00:39:00	00:39:02	But my sister deserved better.
533	00:39:03	00:39:04	So you killed him?
534	00:39:04	00:39:08	Did you see his body?
535	00:39:08	00:39:12	Hayden was a monster passing for a Regular Joe.
536	00:39:12	00:39:17	My parents blamed me for introducing them.
537	00:39:17	00:39:21	You know, the werewolf disease, it's hereditary.
538	00:39:21	00:39:26	It means my sister could've given birth to freaks.
539	00:39:26	00:39:28	And the silver bullet?
540	00:39:28	00:39:30	Figured it was appropriate.
541	00:39:30	00:39:39	So you left your parents', you went back to your place to make the bullet and then you went over to Hayden's.
542	00:39:39	00:39:41	Yeah.
543	00:39:41	00:39:43	So it was premeditated.
544	00:39:43	00:39:46	I guess you can forget heat of the moment as a mitigating factor here.
545	00:39:46	00:39:48	I did the right thing.
546	00:39:48	00:39:50	My sister's out there waiting.
547	00:39:50	00:39:56	Since I confessed, can I at least go out and talk to her?
548	00:39:56	00:39:57	Explain why I did it.
549	00:39:58	00:40:01	Why don't I do that for you.
550	00:40:18	00:40:19	Ms. Moyer...
551	00:40:19	00:40:23	your brother confessed to killing Hayden.
552	00:40:31	00:40:35	After our last conversation, I checked the TV listings.
553	00:40:35	00:40:37	There was no golf tournament that night.
554	00:40:37	00:40:42	I think you were calling Hayden to warn him about Brent.
555	00:40:45	00:40:49	I had just announced our engagement to my family.
556	00:40:51	00:40:53	Brent flipped out.
557	00:40:53	00:40:55	I was upset.
558	00:40:56	00:40:59	Everyone was yelling at me.
559	00:40:59	00:41:01	I went for a long walk to clear my head.
560	00:41:01	00:41:05	And when I got back, Brent was gone.
561	00:41:05	00:41:08	He told my parents that he was going to speak with Hayden.
562	00:41:08	00:41:11	But you had your doubts.
563	00:41:11	00:41:13	My brother has a temper.
564	00:41:13	00:41:17	Why didn't you tell us this before?
565	00:41:17	00:41:25	When Brent called and told me that Hayden was dead, he said that if I told you guys...
566	00:41:25	00:41:27	if I implicated him...
567	00:41:27	00:41:28	He threatened you.
568	00:41:37	00:41:40	It's okay.
569	00:41:40	00:41:42	You're safe now.
570	00:41:42	00:41:44	Allison...
571	00:41:44	00:41:46	what are you going to do now?
572	00:41:46	00:41:48	I'll be okay.
573	00:41:49	00:41:51	It's not like when I was a kid.
574	00:41:51	00:41:54	I can pretty much get anything I need off the internet.
575	00:41:54	00:41:56	And you're set with money?
576	00:41:56	00:41:58	I'll manage.
577	00:41:58	00:42:06	Allison, I have every confidence that you're going to be just fine here, but...
578	00:42:06	00:42:09	if you ever need anything, would you please give me a call?
579	00:42:09	00:42:11	I-I will, Ms. Willows.
580	00:42:11	00:42:13	Catherine.
581	00:42:13	00:42:15	Catherine.
582	00:42:18	00:42:20	I haven't been completely honest with you.
583	00:42:22	00:42:27	I told you my mother was dead, but that's not true.
584	00:42:27	00:42:29	I'm not sure I follow.
585	00:42:29	00:42:37	Hayden told me she was in a car wreck and I called the funeral home to send flowers.
586	00:42:37	00:42:45	They had never heard of her, so I called the local hospitals, same thing.
587	00:42:45	00:42:57	Recently, I contacted peopledetectors.com and, apparently, she lives in Las Vegas.
588	00:42:57	00:42:59	She just couldn't live with me.
589	00:43:02	00:43:06	So you were the one that contacted peopledetectors.
590	00:43:06	00:43:08	Yeah.
591	00:43:08	00:43:11	When my brother was out, I used his computer.
