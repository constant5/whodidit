0	00:00:15	00:00:17	Can I get a cup of coffee from...
1	00:00:18	00:00:20	Where do you want to go tonight?
2	00:00:20	00:00:22	You want, to, like...
3	00:00:22	00:00:24	I'd like a tall latte with, uh, two shots... (static)
4	00:00:25	00:00:26	Coming right up. Thanks.
5	00:00:28	00:00:30	Would you like anything to eat, sir?
6	00:00:30	00:00:32	No, thank you.
7	00:00:32	00:00:34	That'll be three dollars, please.
8	00:00:34	00:00:37	Um, look, I don't suppose you could, uh, break a 50?
9	00:00:37	00:00:39	For a three-dollar latte?
10	00:00:39	00:00:41	Well, it's all I have.
11	00:00:41	00:00:43	All right. (clears throat)
12	00:00:43	00:00:44	Thank you; thank you so much.
13	00:00:49	00:00:52	Mr. Merchiston?
14	00:00:52	00:00:54	Keep walking.
15	00:00:55	00:00:56	Who are you?
16	00:00:56	00:00:58	A friend of Suvari.
17	00:00:58	00:00:59	Where is Suvari?
18	00:00:59	00:01:01	Not here, but I am.
19	00:01:01	00:01:06	Right. And what assurance do I have that this man Suvari is actually real?
20	00:01:06	00:01:10	How does Suvari really know that you're a reporter?
21	00:01:10	00:01:12	And not an Agency asset?
22	00:01:12	00:01:16	Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I've yet to be mistaken for James Bond.
23	00:01:18	00:01:19	Aw.
24	00:01:24	00:01:25	Suvari will be in touch.
25	00:02:08	00:02:10	Control, this is 3-David-34.
26	00:02:10	00:02:12	Reporting a possible 425-Baker.
27	00:02:12	00:02:14	In pursuit of a silver Camaro.
28	00:02:14	00:02:16	License Adam-King-Sam-Henry, 413.
29	00:02:16	00:02:20	Vehicle's traveling southbound on Rialto Ridge at high rate of speed.
30	00:02:22	00:02:24	Backup units, be advised.
31	00:02:24	00:02:25	Suspect vehicle has turned onto Wilmington.
32	00:02:32	00:02:34	He's heading for the Strip.
33	00:02:34	00:02:37	Control, this guy's not stopping.
34	00:02:37	00:02:39	We need to bring him down before he hurts somebody.
35	00:02:42	00:02:44	He's crossing lanes!
36	00:02:46	00:02:47	Oh, my God!
37	00:02:47	00:02:52	All units, fire and paramedics are en route to your location.
38	00:02:53	00:02:55	Thank you.
39	00:02:55	00:02:57	Yeager?! What are you doing here?
40	00:02:57	00:02:59	Oh, I'm pulling double shifts this week.
41	00:02:59	00:03:01	Need the hours, so you're stuck with me.
42	00:03:01	00:03:08	So, our driver raced through the intersection, lost control, hit this lamp pole, and spun out over there.
43	00:03:08	00:03:09	The vehicle's registered to Zenith Car Rentals.
44	00:03:09	00:03:11	Office will be open in a hour.
45	00:03:11	00:03:12	We'll get the renter's name then.
46	00:03:12	00:03:14	Think I have an I.D.
47	00:03:17	00:03:19	Passport.
48	00:03:22	00:03:24	Finn... check this out.
49	00:03:35	00:03:37	It's John Merchiston.
50	00:03:37	00:03:39	The reporter?
51	00:03:39	00:03:40	Yeah.
52	00:03:40	00:03:42	I don't understand.
53	00:03:42	00:03:44	Why would he run from the LVPD?
54	00:03:44	00:03:45	I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.
55	00:03:45	00:03:49	Well, if this guy's a reporter, maybe there's more to the story.
56	00:04:50	00:04:52	That voice inside your head.
57	00:04:52	00:04:54	The day that it does go quiet.
58	00:04:56	00:04:58	Do you think that that that will bring you peace?
59	00:04:58	00:05:00	Or will it be a loss too great to bear?
60	00:05:04	00:05:07	Merchiston and I spent a lot of time together.
61	00:05:07	00:05:09	I suppose he got to know me a little bit.
62	00:05:09	00:05:11	But I don't, I don't know anything about him.
63	00:05:11	00:05:13	I don't know if he had a family...
64	00:05:13	00:05:14	He doesn't have any family.
65	00:05:17	00:05:19	Well, hell.
66	00:05:19	00:05:21	All right.
67	00:05:21	00:05:22	What do we know?
68	00:05:22	00:05:25	On the face of it, it looks like an accident.
69	00:05:25	00:05:27	What's that supposed to mean-- on the face of it?
70	00:05:27	00:05:28	Well, look at the vehicle.
71	00:05:28	00:05:30	There's nothing left of it.
72	00:05:30	00:05:32	I mean, the engine is all the way over there.
73	00:05:32	00:05:34	Have you ever seen a car accident like this?
74	00:05:34	00:05:36	Yeah, sadly, I have.
75	00:05:36	00:05:38	Alcohol, drugs, a lead foot.
76	00:05:38	00:05:39	I see it all the time.
77	00:05:39	00:05:42	Yeah, well, John didn't drink and he didn't do drugs.
78	00:05:42	00:05:44	He had been sober for over two years.
79	00:05:44	00:05:47	Is there something you should be telling me?
80	00:05:47	00:05:50	John was working on a story.
81	00:05:50	00:05:54	Something to do with the government and domestic spying.
82	00:05:54	00:05:55	He told me that he was being followed.
83	00:05:55	00:05:57	I, of course, thought that he was paranoid.
84	00:05:57	00:06:00	Wait, wait a minute.
85	00:06:00	00:06:01	When did this happen?
86	00:06:01	00:06:02	Well, a couple of months ago.
87	00:06:02	00:06:03	I-I had, uh, you know...
88	00:06:03	00:06:04	We stayed in touch.
89	00:06:04	00:06:07	You'd stayed in touch.
90	00:06:07	00:06:09	Yes, we stayed in touch.
91	00:06:09	00:06:11	I'm listening.
92	00:06:11	00:06:20	The extent of the damage to the car, the behavior of a man who had no reason to run from the police, and yet, was obviously running from something.
93	00:06:20	00:06:21	So you think this was murder?
94	00:06:21	00:06:23	That John was targeted?
95	00:06:23	00:06:26	I think he was being silenced for something that he knew.
96	00:06:26	00:06:28	Somebody puts a bomb in the car?
97	00:06:28	00:06:30	Detonates it during a high-speed police chase?
98	00:06:30	00:06:32	Is that what you think? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
99	00:06:32	00:06:34	That's way out there, Jules.
100	00:06:34	00:06:40	You don't believe that there are parts of government that would go to extreme measures to silence someone?
101	00:06:40	00:06:41	What I believe in is evidence.
102	00:06:41	00:06:46	And so should you if you're thinking about accusing somebody in authority.
103	00:06:47	00:06:53	Based on this video footage, I can't tell if Finn's theory is correct, and the car exploded before hitting the light pole.
104	00:06:53	00:06:55	Or if it happened on impact.
105	00:06:55	00:06:58	Here's the rest of the traffic cam footage from the chase.
106	00:06:58	00:07:03	Merchiston ran the red light at Sahara and Rialto Ridge already doing 90.
107	00:07:03	00:07:05	Let's see where This chase began.
108	00:07:09	00:07:11	Garage at the Embarcadero?
109	00:07:11	00:07:13	Man, he came flying out of there. Hmm.
110	00:07:13	00:07:18	And that is the best angle from the street of the Embarcadero we have.
111	00:07:18	00:07:20	We might be able to track him moving through the mall.
112	00:07:20	00:07:22	Let's see.
113	00:07:22	00:07:25	Hello.
114	00:07:25	00:07:26	Who's the mystery woman?
115	00:07:26	00:07:27	I don't know.
116	00:07:27	00:07:29	But it looks like she handed him something.
117	00:07:29	00:07:31	And the way the light's hitting it, it looks metallic.
118	00:07:31	00:07:33	Maybe a key?
119	00:07:33	00:07:34	Merchiston was a journalist.
120	00:07:34	00:07:37	I'm thinking that that was a flash drive.
121	00:07:37	00:07:39	We didn't find a flash drive at the scene.
122	00:07:39	00:07:41	Though I doubt it would have survived that explosion.
123	00:07:41	00:07:46	You know, she was the last person to see Merchiston alive. We need to find her.
124	00:07:46	00:07:51	So, Mr. Merchiston, you go from rock journalist to quixotic muckraker.
125	00:07:51	00:07:54	I'd have to say I'm just a seeker of the truth.
126	00:07:54	00:07:58	And if that makes certain people uncomfortable, then maybe they need to be uncomfortable.
127	00:07:58	00:08:05	'Cause I would say that in our obsession with security, we may be relinquishing our freedom.
128	00:08:05	00:08:08	Surrendering to the real enemy-- fear.
129	00:08:08	00:08:11	Finished my autopsy on Mr. Merchiston.
130	00:08:11	00:08:17	massive blunt force trauma consistent with high speed impact.
131	00:08:17	00:08:23	If it's any consolation, death would've been mercifully quick-- long before the fire consumed the vehicle.
132	00:08:23	00:08:28	Tox report shows high levels of cocaine, and a blood alcohol level of .19.
133	00:08:28	00:08:31	And in that condition, I'm not surprised he didn't want to get pulled over.
134	00:08:31	00:08:34	It says here you're going to rule it an accident.
135	00:08:34	00:08:37	He should never have been behind the wheel.
136	00:09:08	00:09:10	I got your text.
137	00:09:10	00:09:11	You find something?
138	00:09:11	00:09:13	Yeah, something I've never seen before.
139	00:09:13	00:09:16	At first, I thought this was some kind of triggering device.
140	00:09:16	00:09:19	It's a black box, like on a plane.
141	00:09:19	00:09:21	It was installed after-market by the rental car company.
142	00:09:21	00:09:26	It's Wi-Fi. They use it to monitor all their vehicles-- location, speed...
143	00:09:26	00:09:35	All right, so, it's not part of a bomb, but it is a black box, so, maybe there's some information in it that would suggest that there was a bomb.
144	00:09:35	00:09:38	Possible. Here is the file of the car's last trip.
145	00:09:38	00:09:41	Merchiston floored it down Rialto Ridge.
146	00:09:41	00:09:44	He made a left turn, then crashed.
147	00:09:44	00:09:51	These vitals and the GPS indicate a single catastrophic event occurring at the coordinates where the car hit the pole.
148	00:09:51	00:09:55	So, your explosion happened upon contact.
149	00:09:55	00:09:57	Well, that doesn't rule out a bomb.
150	00:09:57	00:09:59	Well, it doesn't support it, either.
151	00:09:59	00:10:00	This might.
152	00:10:00	00:10:04	I found unusually high levels of aluminum, magnesium, silicon and iron oxide in the wreckage.
153	00:10:04	00:10:09	All are consistent with a thermite explosion.
154	00:10:09	00:10:12	Well, that would explain the intensity of the blast that we saw on the tape.
155	00:10:12	00:10:13	And the condition of the vehicle.
156	00:10:13	00:10:18	But... we are talking about a car exploding upon impact with a light pole.
157	00:10:18	00:10:24	And the metals present in thermite are also found in laptops, cell phones, tablets.
158	00:10:24	00:10:29	I know that you're looking for a different answer, but I think that we need to find something more definitive.
159	00:10:32	00:10:36	John's attorney is here, and she wants us to release his body.
160	00:10:38	00:10:39	I don't understand.
161	00:10:39	00:10:42	I thought the circumstances of John's accident were pretty clear-cut.
162	00:10:42	00:10:47	Well, we still have a... few questions, Ms. McDermott, and we thought maybe you could, uh...
163	00:10:47	00:10:49	you could help us.
164	00:10:49	00:10:51	Questions like what?
165	00:10:51	00:10:58	Uh, like, what was the story that John was working on which brought him here to Vegas in the last few months?
166	00:10:58	00:11:00	John.
167	00:11:00	00:11:02	So it's you.
168	00:11:04	00:11:06	John always had a weakness for blondes.
169	00:11:08	00:11:10	Your client is dead.
170	00:11:10	00:11:14	Any information you have might help us close this case.
171	00:11:14	00:11:15	So do me a favor, will you?
172	00:11:15	00:11:17	Do you, do you recognize this woman?
173	00:11:19	00:11:20	No. Why?
174	00:11:20	00:11:23	She was the last person to see John alive.
175	00:11:23	00:11:26	We think that she passed him some information.
176	00:11:26	00:11:28	I've never seen her before.
177	00:11:28	00:11:31	All I know is John was working on an investigative piece.
178	00:11:31	00:11:35	Something to do with computer hacking and domestic intelligence gathering.
179	00:11:35	00:11:37	So, spying on U.S. citizens.
180	00:11:37	00:11:39	Allegedly.
181	00:11:39	00:11:44	The point person is an Air Force general, Robert Lansdale, out of Nellis.
182	00:11:44	00:11:45	Nellis.
183	00:11:45	00:11:48	That would help explain all the trips to Vegas.
184	00:11:48	00:11:51	Yeah, and why his accident may not have been an accident.
185	00:11:51	00:11:55	I know John had a gift for telling a good tale.
186	00:11:55	00:11:57	Seducing his listener.
187	00:11:57	00:12:01	But the truth is, his story was going nowhere.
188	00:12:01	00:12:03	He was frustrated.
189	00:12:03	00:12:04	So you think it was an accident?
190	00:12:04	00:12:08	I do. Well, you must have known that he had enemies. Yes.
191	00:12:08	00:12:13	But, also, you must know that John's own worst enemy was always himself.
192	00:12:17	00:12:21	Yeager, it's Russell. Where are we on the security footage from the Embarcadero?
193	00:12:22	00:12:24	Well-Well then, go to another judge.
194	00:12:24	00:12:25	We need those tapes.
195	00:12:25	00:12:30	I want eyes on Merchiston and this mystery woman, wherever they went, okay?
196	00:12:30	00:12:32	Call me back.
197	00:12:43	00:12:45	Oh!
198	00:12:47	00:12:48	John?
199	00:12:50	00:12:53	What the hell are you doing? We thought you were ...dead. Dead.
200	00:12:53	00:12:55	Yeah, I know.
201	00:12:55	00:12:57	We don't have much time. I can't stay here.
202	00:12:57	00:12:59	Where's your car?
203	00:12:59	00:13:01	Where is your car? We need to get out of here, now.
204	00:13:07	00:13:10	What the hell is going on, John? I wish I knew.
205	00:13:10	00:13:13	I wish I bloody knew. You know a lot more than I do. Start... Come here.
206	00:13:13	00:13:14	Whose body is in our morgue?
207	00:13:14	00:13:16	Oh, it's Brian.
208	00:13:16	00:13:18	Brian Freeman, he's my assistant.
209	00:13:18	00:13:19	He was driving my car.
210	00:13:21	00:13:22	I gave him my coat and my hat.
211	00:13:22	00:13:27	He took his place behind the wheel of my car and I slipped out the back, and we both know what happened after that. No, no.
212	00:13:27	00:13:29	We identified the body using your dental records.
213	00:13:29	00:13:31	How is that possible?
214	00:13:31	00:13:33	Same way you got a tox report claiming that I was high.
215	00:13:33	00:13:34	And drunk. Don't play games with me!
216	00:13:34	00:13:37	Talk to me! I'm not playing games with you!
217	00:13:37	00:13:38	I'm covering a story.
218	00:13:38	00:13:41	I know. About domestic spying, right?
219	00:13:41	00:13:45	So you know it's of a sensitive nature, involving powerful people.
220	00:13:45	00:13:51	People capable of hacking into a crime lab computer, fabricating a toxicology report labeling me a drunk driver.
221	00:13:51	00:13:53	What about the dental records?
222	00:13:53	00:13:56	Well, they've got their hackers, and I've got mine.
223	00:13:56	00:13:58	I-I need your help, DB.
224	00:13:58	00:14:01	John, I'm just a local cop.
225	00:14:01	00:14:04	If what you're saying is true, you need to...
226	00:14:04	00:14:06	you need to talk to a friend of mine at the FBI.
227	00:14:06	00:14:08	FBI? You're joking, are you?
228	00:14:08	00:14:10	That's the last place I'm going is the FBI.
229	00:14:12	00:14:14	You are hardly a local cop.
230	00:14:14	00:14:19	In fact, you and your team-- you're literally the only ones who can help me.
231	00:14:22	00:14:24	Please, DB.
232	00:14:24	00:14:26	My life's in your hands.
233	00:14:26	00:14:28	The people who are trying to kill me, the people who...
234	00:14:28	00:14:29	killed Brian.
235	00:14:29	00:14:32	When they find out their mistake...
236	00:14:32	00:14:33	they will try again.
237	00:14:33	00:14:36	I just need to lay low for a while.
238	00:14:36	00:14:38	Until I can figure out what the hell's on this.
239	00:14:42	00:14:45	I heard you got your hands on the security cam footage from the Embarcadero mall.
240	00:14:45	00:14:47	Yeah, yeah, I'm going through it right now.
241	00:14:47	00:14:49	Well, how the hell did you pull that off?
242	00:14:49	00:14:54	'Cause I've been on the phone for three hours with four different judges, and I couldn't even get close to a warrant.
243	00:14:54	00:14:57	Yeager, sometimes you have to know who to ask and how to ask.
244	00:14:57	00:15:05	There was a very lovely, nice young woman working at Embarcadero operations who was more than happy to give me a hand.
245	00:15:05	00:15:06	Well, I'm impressed.
246	00:15:06	00:15:07	Thank you. Yeah.
247	00:15:07	00:15:11	Here she makes the drop-off, and then she just kind of heads off through the crowd.
248	00:15:11	00:15:13	What's behind the corner, there?
249	00:15:16	00:15:18	Look at the reflection.
250	00:15:18	00:15:21	Let's see if I can get a taxi number.
251	00:15:22	00:15:23	I'm impressed again.
252	00:15:23	00:15:26	T312X.
253	00:15:26	00:15:29	Call the company, see where the cabbie dropped her off.
254	00:15:35	00:15:36	I can't believe it.
255	00:15:39	00:15:41	I'm sorry, I-I had nowhere else to go.
256	00:15:41	00:15:42	All right, come on in.
257	00:15:45	00:15:52	Let's start at the beginning, with, uh, the flash drive and the woman who gave it to you. Like I told you, I'm working on a story right now.
258	00:15:52	00:15:54	Uh, I have an inside man.
259	00:15:54	00:15:58	He's providing me with information on Project Jericho, which is a domestic spying program.
260	00:15:58	00:16:00	And he goes by the name of Suvari.
261	00:16:00	00:16:04	So the woman was your contact? I don't know who the woman is. I've never met her before.
262	00:16:04	00:16:07	You see, in the past, Suvari just arranged a dead drop.
263	00:16:07	00:16:10	He'd leave a flash drive somewhere and I'd find it.
264	00:16:10	00:16:11	But not this time. No, no.
265	00:16:11	00:16:14	This time I told him I actually need to look him in the eye.
266	00:16:14	00:16:19	Before I publish my story, I need to be assured that the information that he's providing on Project Jericho is genuine.
267	00:16:19	00:16:22	Specifically, about the man who's-who's running things.
268	00:16:22	00:16:23	Who's some Air Force general.
269	00:16:23	00:16:26	Robert Lansdale.
270	00:16:26	00:16:28	How did you...? Oh, that's all right, go on.
271	00:16:28	00:16:33	Right. Well, amongst other things right now, they're using drones for domestic surveillance.
272	00:16:33	00:16:34	who are they watching?
273	00:16:34	00:16:36	And who's watching the watchmen?
274	00:16:36	00:16:38	Precisely. Um...
275	00:16:38	00:16:44	I was told that the information off this flash drive would make Snowden's leaks look like a minor blip on the radar.
276	00:16:44	00:16:47	I'm assuming that the files are encrypted.
277	00:16:47	00:16:50	I had the decryption key on my laptop.
278	00:16:50	00:16:51	That was in my car.
279	00:16:51	00:16:53	Which is where we come in.
280	00:16:53	00:16:55	Assuming that you can crack it.
281	00:16:55	00:17:00	The safest place for you right now is to stay here. First, we need to find out what's on this flash drive.
282	00:17:00	00:17:02	Then we can figure out what our next move is.
283	00:17:02	00:17:04	Where are you going?
284	00:17:04	00:17:08	I'm gonna go back to the lab. The three of us are the only people that know that John's still alive.
285	00:17:08	00:17:09	Let-Let's keep it that way.
286	00:17:09	00:17:12	I'll call you when I get something.
287	00:17:16	00:17:22	The cab company said our mystery woman 15.
288	00:17:22	00:17:25	Hotel has her registered under the name Emily Rey.
289	00:17:25	00:17:28	Security checked her room, she wasn't there.
290	00:17:28	00:17:31	An hour ago, we get a call out here-- 419.
291	00:17:33	00:17:35	She fits the description.
292	00:17:35	00:17:37	Super Dave, what's the word?
293	00:17:37	00:17:40	TOD's approximately six hours ago.
294	00:17:40	00:17:44	And we got blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
295	00:17:44	00:17:45	Yeah.
296	00:17:47	00:17:52	All this spatter, cast-off, I'd be willing to bet you she was hit more than a couple of times, yeah?
297	00:17:52	00:17:54	Definitely.
298	00:17:54	00:17:56	Hey, we got more blood over here.
299	00:17:56	00:17:59	Gravitational drops...
300	00:17:59	00:18:02	could've come off the weapon.
301	00:18:04	00:18:05	Nick...
302	00:18:10	00:18:12	Oh, yeah.
303	00:18:12	00:18:15	Got a print and blood. And a good one, at that.
304	00:18:15	00:18:18	Just sent the photo to the lab, they're running a check.
305	00:18:20	00:18:21	Just got a hit.
306	00:18:21	00:18:22	That was quick.
307	00:18:22	00:18:24	What the hell?
308	00:18:24	00:18:25	What's wrong?
309	00:18:25	00:18:26	Hey, Dave. Yeah.
310	00:18:26	00:18:29	You say the time of death was six hours ago, right?
311	00:18:29	00:18:30	That's right. Why?
312	00:18:32	00:18:34	Our killer's a dead man.
313	00:18:39	00:18:40	Greg...
314	00:18:40	00:18:41	I got something I need you to do.
315	00:18:41	00:18:43	Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
316	00:18:43	00:18:44	Well, this takes priority.
317	00:18:44	00:18:46	A flash drive? (cell phone chimes)
318	00:18:46	00:18:47	Files on it are encrypted.
319	00:18:47	00:18:49	I need you to open them up for me.
320	00:18:49	00:18:51	Oh, damn it.
321	00:18:51	00:18:52	Is everything all right?
322	00:18:52	00:18:54	Just-Just do it.
323	00:18:55	00:18:56	DB...
324	00:18:56	00:19:02	We got a problem. I need to talk to you about that Merchiston car wreck. All right, come in, come in.
325	00:19:02	00:19:06	Well, there's something just not right about it.
326	00:19:09	00:19:14	Tell me what you know. Yeager and I tracked down the mystery woman, the one that met Merchiston in the mall.
327	00:19:14	00:19:16	I'm pretty sure those two hooked up again later.
328	00:19:16	00:19:17	Why do you say that?
329	00:19:17	00:19:19	'Cause she's dead.
330	00:19:19	00:19:23	Beaten to death with a crowbar, and Merchiston's fingerprints right there on the murder weapon.
331	00:19:23	00:19:26	Now, she was killed six hours ago.
332	00:19:26	00:19:28	His car crash was 36 hours ago.
333	00:19:28	00:19:29	I mean, you do the math.
334	00:19:29	00:19:32	Are you absolutely positive about the fingerprint?
335	00:19:32	00:19:34	It's in the victim's blood.
336	00:19:34	00:19:38	Listen, Merchiston is still alive, and he's a stone-cold killer.
337	00:19:39	00:19:41	What's going on?
338	00:20:02	00:20:04	You scared me.
339	00:20:04	00:20:06	That wasn't my intention.
340	00:20:06	00:20:09	John, I-I...
341	00:20:09	00:20:15	Something happened since the last time I saw you.
342	00:20:15	00:20:16	What?
343	00:20:16	00:20:19	I don't want to talk about it.
344	00:20:30	00:20:32	Russell left me a message.
345	00:20:32	00:20:33	Really? What about?
346	00:20:33	00:20:34	I'm checking.
347	00:20:45	00:20:46	What's the matter?
348	00:20:49	00:20:50	Why are you looking at me like that?
349	00:20:53	00:20:54	FBI! Drop the gun.
350	00:20:55	00:20:59	CSI Finlay, gun on the floor.
351	00:20:59	00:21:00	Now!
352	00:21:03	00:21:04	Give me the gun, Julie.
353	00:21:06	00:21:09	We have to take you in. Both of you.
354	00:21:36	00:21:37	CSI Russell.
355	00:21:37	00:21:40	Special Agent Sturgis, FBI.
356	00:21:40	00:21:42	I'm going to need to read you your rights.
357	00:21:42	00:21:44	That's all right...
358	00:21:44	00:21:46	I think I know them.
359	00:21:55	00:21:56	CSI Russell.
360	00:21:56	00:21:58	Sorry to keep you waiting.
361	00:21:58	00:22:00	Well, it's a long trip from Nellis.
362	00:22:00	00:22:02	General Lansdale, right?
363	00:22:02	00:22:06	No uniform-- I'm guessing this conversation's off the record.
364	00:22:08	00:22:10	John Merchiston...
365	00:22:10	00:22:13	man's a murderer.
366	00:22:13	00:22:16	But worse than that, he's a threat to this country.
367	00:22:16	00:22:18	Can you prove either one of those allegations?
368	00:22:18	00:22:20	FBI will.
369	00:22:20	00:22:23	At this moment, they're securing all the evidence from your lab.
370	00:22:23	00:22:28	You need to know that my people had no knowledge of this whatsoever. Does that include CSI Finlay?
371	00:22:29	00:22:33	Despite your best efforts to alert her, she and Mr. Merchiston are in custody.
372	00:22:35	00:22:37	I know...
373	00:22:37	00:22:40	that you have a relationship with John Merchiston.
374	00:22:40	00:22:42	Maybe you trust him-- but you shouldn't.
375	00:22:42	00:22:47	I'm not sure who I should be trusting right now, General.
376	00:22:47	00:22:50	Well, you certainly come by that honestly.
377	00:22:50	00:22:52	I know about your parents.
378	00:22:52	00:22:55	About their activities during the '60s.
379	00:22:55	00:22:59	But you, you... you became a cop.
380	00:22:59	00:23:02	That says a lot about you, about them.
381	00:23:02	00:23:06	Must feel sort of odd sitting on that side of the table.
382	00:23:06	00:23:08	What do you want?
383	00:23:08	00:23:13	I want to know what Merchiston told you about a gentleman named Suvari.
384	00:23:13	00:23:14	He didn't tell me anything.
385	00:23:14	00:23:18	I'm here as a courtesy, Mr. Russell.
386	00:23:18	00:23:21	The FBI can continue this conversation.
387	00:23:21	00:23:23	(clears throat softly) What about my lab?
388	00:23:23	00:23:30	I don't think it'll look very good for either one of us, General, if the wheels of justice grind to a halt.
389	00:23:34	00:23:37	I'll give you an opportunity to make arrangements with your team.
390	00:23:39	00:23:41	You're a lucky man.
391	00:23:41	00:23:47	You got a family, good job, so much to live for.
392	00:23:47	00:23:52	You should know from personal experience the cost of misplaced loyalty.
393	00:24:13	00:24:20	We believe your friend John Merchiston has been receiving leaks of classified information vital to our nation's security.
394	00:24:20	00:24:25	Leaks from an inside source, goes by the name Suvari.
395	00:24:25	00:24:26	I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah?
396	00:24:26	00:24:30	Obviously, you know one thing-- Merchiston faked his own death.
397	00:24:30	00:24:34	When he realized we were closing in on him, he set up his assistant.
398	00:24:34	00:24:35	Murdered him.
399	00:24:35	00:24:40	Then he murdered this woman, Emily Rey, the only other person who could connect him to this Suvari.
400	00:24:40	00:24:42	Looks like you got it all figured out.
401	00:24:42	00:24:43	Why do you need me?
402	00:24:43	00:24:48	Well, maybe this Emily Rey isn't the only connection to Suvari.
403	00:24:48	00:24:52	Well, if that's the case, why didn't John kill me?
404	00:24:52	00:24:55	I like to think we saved your life.
405	00:24:55	00:25:01	Now it's your turn-- to help save the lives of perhaps thousands, if these security leaks are allowed to go unchecked.
406	00:25:01	00:25:03	I don't buy it.
407	00:25:05	00:25:09	That's... not the cooperative attitude I was looking for.
408	00:25:09	00:25:17	I don't know if you're protecting Merchiston because you've fallen for him or his politics, or maybe he's just a great lay.
409	00:25:17	00:25:21	Honestly, I don't care. Whatever pillow talk you two shared, you are gonna give it up.
410	00:25:21	00:25:24	At the risk of sounding like your British boy toy...
411	00:25:24	00:25:26	we could go all night.
412	00:25:26	00:25:27	You know what, Agent?
413	00:25:27	00:25:28	Go screw yourself!
414	00:25:28	00:25:30	That's what you wanted to say, right?
415	00:25:30	00:25:33	Finlay, I advise you not to say another word.
416	00:25:33	00:25:35	You're here as an observer, Captain.
417	00:25:35	00:25:37	This is my house; these are my people.
418	00:25:37	00:25:40	And if you don't start acting nice, I'm gonna kick your FBI ass right out of here.
419	00:25:48	00:25:50	Russell. Russell.
420	00:25:50	00:25:54	Hey, I got your message. Looks like Finn and I are gonna be here for a little while.
421	00:25:54	00:25:59	Merchiston's being charged with willful communication of national defense information.
422	00:25:59	00:26:01	And murder.
423	00:26:01	00:26:03	He's letting his lawyer do the talking right now.
424	00:26:03	00:26:08	According to them, we harbored someone who stole secrets, faked his own death, and then murdered two people.
425	00:26:08	00:26:13	Unless we can prove that someone was setting Merchiston up the whole time.
426	00:26:13	00:26:19	I mean, we have his bloody fingerprint on the murder weapon-- that makes for a pretty good argument. I know, but...
427	00:26:19	00:26:23	he once did a forensic field training with Scotland Yard.
428	00:26:23	00:26:28	So he's not stupid enough to leave his bloody fingerprint behind.
429	00:26:28	00:26:30	Look, you're the boss now, bud.
430	00:26:30	00:26:33	Get us out of here, will you?
431	00:27:21	00:27:27	FBI yanked all the files on the Merchiston case, but I still had a photo of the bloody fingerprint in my phone. Check it out.
432	00:27:27	00:27:29	Tell me what you see or what you don't see.
433	00:27:29	00:27:32	Ridge detail's all there.
434	00:27:32	00:27:34	But there are no pores.
435	00:27:34	00:27:36	How is that even possible?
436	00:27:36	00:27:39	We've seen this before, haven't we, Greg?
437	00:27:39	00:27:40	The Millander case.
438	00:27:40	00:27:41	Mm-hmm.
439	00:27:41	00:27:47	A serial killer made a mold of Grissom's print in latex, planted it at a crime scene.
440	00:27:47	00:27:51	But unlike skin, latex gives you ridge detail but no pores.
441	00:27:51	00:27:56	Russell was right-- this whole thing's a setup, from the Emily Rey murder to the car crash-- all of it.
442	00:27:56	00:27:58	Sounds pretty sophisticated.
443	00:27:58	00:28:00	Do we think the FBI's involved?
444	00:28:00	00:28:02	No... no, I think they're just doing their job.
445	00:28:02	00:28:04	Well, then who is it? I don't know.
446	00:28:04	00:28:10	But I don't even know where to start looking now that they've walked off with everything.
447	00:28:10	00:28:12	Maybe not everything.
448	00:28:14	00:28:17	Russell gave this to me right after Merchiston came back from the dead.
449	00:28:17	00:28:24	The guy's accused of stealing classified information-- it might be on there. It might also show who's trying to set Merchiston up.
450	00:28:24	00:28:26	Even help spring Russell and Finn.
451	00:28:26	00:28:31	With all these eyes on us, it's gonna be almost impossible to do the job.
452	00:28:32	00:28:39	All eyes are on us, but I can think of somebody who might be able to fly under the radar.
453	00:28:44	00:28:46	Hey, Nick.
454	00:28:46	00:28:48	Hey. This was left at Reception. What is it?
455	00:28:48	00:28:51	Nevada Wireless-- looks like a new phone.
456	00:28:51	00:28:52	I didn't order a phone.
457	00:29:13	00:29:15	Hi. Hi.
458	00:29:15	00:29:17	I'll have a cup of coffee, please.
459	00:29:17	00:29:19	Sure. What flavor?
460	00:29:19	00:29:21	Coffee-flavored.
461	00:29:21	00:29:24	That'll be $1.35, sir.
462	00:29:24	00:29:26	Keep it.
463	00:29:26	00:29:27	Thank you.
464	00:29:38	00:29:40	You're Suvari?
465	00:29:40	00:29:46	I'm not, but... he reached out to me, said he could help my client and your CSI friends.
466	00:29:46	00:29:48	Okay. Where is he?
467	00:29:48	00:29:49	I'm supposed to take you to him.
468	00:29:57	00:30:01	So, you, uh, decrypted the files on the flash drive I gave you?
469	00:30:01	00:30:08	Files are classified the use of drones to listen in on communications.
470	00:30:08	00:30:14	Now, this is all in the development stages, but definitely something DoD would not want to go public.
471	00:30:14	00:30:21	All right, but is it serious enough that someone from the government would be willing to stage a fake car crash, murder a woman, just to...
472	00:30:21	00:30:24	keep it a secret? Just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not following you.
473	00:30:24	00:30:26	In this case, backseat driving.
474	00:30:26	00:30:29	What do you mean?
475	00:30:29	00:30:54	One of the files references-- One of the files refers to Wi-Fi technology, which enables a user to hack a car's onboard CPUs-- specifically, after-market black boxes, like the one that was installed in Merchiston's rental car. So you're saying that they've developed a software that allows you to take control of a car... remotely.
476	00:30:54	00:30:56	And remotely crash it.
477	00:30:56	00:31:03	There's also references to enhancing the effects of the accident with a thermite cocktail-- ka-boom!
478	00:31:03	00:31:07	All right, well, that still doesn't mean that someone from the government is behind all of this.
479	00:31:07	00:31:10	For all we know, it could be this guy Suvari.
480	00:31:19	00:31:22	You're not gonna tell me where we're going?
481	00:31:22	00:31:24	You want to meet Suvari or don't you?
482	00:31:24	00:31:27	There's a rest stop outside of Searchlight.
483	00:31:27	00:31:29	He said to wait for him there.
484	00:31:36	00:31:38	Hey, you mind slowing down?
485	00:31:38	00:31:39	I'd like to get there in one piece.
486	00:31:39	00:31:41	It's not me-- my foot's off the pedal.
487	00:31:41	00:31:43	Turn off the cruise control.
488	00:31:43	00:31:45	No, it's not on.
489	00:31:48	00:31:50	Try the brakes. They're not working!
490	00:31:53	00:31:55	All right, all right, just-just stay cool, we got this.
491	00:31:57	00:32:01	What the hell?!
492	00:32:36	00:32:38	What was that?
493	00:32:38	00:32:42	I don't know, but I'm getting the feeling we just took the same kind of ride that...
494	00:32:42	00:32:44	that John's car took.
495	00:32:58	00:33:00	Wasn't that the... the coffee guy from the mall?
496	00:33:09	00:33:12	Well...
497	00:33:12	00:33:15	either he just tried to kill us, or he just saved us.
498	00:33:15	00:33:17	Either way, he left us this.
499	00:34:14	00:34:17	I told you the truth would set us all free.
500	00:34:18	00:34:20	Like I told you...
501	00:34:20	00:34:21	we're on the same side.
502	00:34:22	00:34:24	Call 'em.
503	00:34:33	00:34:34	Hey.
504	00:34:34	00:34:35	Hey, welcome back.
505	00:34:35	00:34:37	Good to be back, thank you very much.
506	00:34:37	00:34:40	We heard you and John's attorney had a close call.
507	00:34:40	00:34:43	We did. One that was headed off by your friend Suvari.
508	00:34:43	00:34:45	You actually met him? So did you.
509	00:34:45	00:34:46	He served you coffee.
510	00:34:48	00:34:50	Okay, what have we got here?
511	00:34:50	00:34:55	Evidence-- proof of the attack on Mr. Merchiston's life using a tactic called Boston Brakes.
512	00:34:55	00:34:57	Boston Brakes?
513	00:34:57	00:35:00	So-called because that was the first place it was used.
514	00:35:00	00:35:02	At least, according to mythology.
515	00:35:02	00:35:08	And that's all I thought it was till I saw the files your colleague Hodges decrypted.
516	00:35:08	00:35:19	Project Jericho included a DoD program that developed technology to hack onboard computers in cars, and I think that Suvari wants us to know it's what happened to this woman and her son, as well.
517	00:35:19	00:35:25	Cheryl Perez worked for DoD as a programmer on Project Jericho.
518	00:35:25	00:35:29	Ms. Perez resigned amid rumors of an affair with a high-ranking officer.
519	00:35:29	00:35:30	General Lansdale?
520	00:35:30	00:35:31	Name never surfaced.
521	00:35:31	00:35:32	Yeah, but it makes sense.
522	00:35:32	00:35:39	Suvari told me he was working on a story that was going to send the walls of Project Jericho tumbling down.
523	00:35:39	00:35:44	Clearly, he's suggesting Lansdale's behind the murder of this woman to cover up the affair.
524	00:35:44	00:35:48	There's the chance that the child found in the back of the car is his son.
525	00:35:48	00:35:52	So now he's targeting anyone who comes close to the truth.
526	00:35:52	00:35:55	Yes, I agree that's what this all looks like, but there are still missing pieces.
527	00:35:55	00:35:57	This Suvari is a mystery man.
528	00:35:57	00:36:01	Coffee vendor said he rented the stand just a couple of times, paid cash.
529	00:36:01	00:36:03	But we don't know who he is or where he's from.
530	00:36:03	00:36:08	Without him, all we really have are allegations against a high-ranking Air Force officer.
531	00:36:08	00:36:10	So we need to find this Suvari.
532	00:36:10	00:36:11	We're working on it.
533	00:36:11	00:36:14	We ran diagnostics on this device.
534	00:36:14	00:36:21	Suvari definitely used it to override whoever was hacking the car that we were in, but, in trying to save us, I think he left himself exposed.
535	00:36:21	00:36:23	He left behind a cyber footprint.
536	00:36:23	00:36:27	Greg is working on that ISP right now.
537	00:36:46	00:36:48	You sure you found the right place?
538	00:36:48	00:36:51	ISP traced here.
539	00:36:51	00:36:52	How? It's not on the grid.
540	00:36:52	00:36:55	You don't even get cell phone service out here.
541	00:36:55	00:36:56	Well, maybe that's the point.
542	00:36:58	00:36:59	Somebody's home.
543	00:37:26	00:37:29	Yeah.
544	00:37:29	00:37:31	Yeah, photos.
545	00:37:31	00:37:32	He's definitely been watching.
546	00:37:32	00:37:35	Bloody duffel bag.
547	00:37:35	00:37:36	Bloody gloves.
548	00:37:38	00:37:40	Emily Rey's wallet.
549	00:37:52	00:37:55	Yeah, yeah, that's him.
550	00:37:55	00:37:57	That's-that's Suvari, or whoever he is.
551	00:38:05	00:38:07	To whom it may concern...
552	00:38:07	00:38:09	What is that, a suicide note?
553	00:38:09	00:38:11	Oh, it's more than that.
554	00:38:11	00:38:13	It's a confession... to all the murders.
555	00:38:16	00:38:20	I don't buy it. Oh, me, either.
556	00:38:20	00:38:22	This evidence, the note...
557	00:38:22	00:38:25	Somebody sure is giving us the hard sell.
558	00:38:29	00:38:31	Sorry, General.
559	00:38:31	00:38:35	Guess it's my turn to keep you waiting.
560	00:38:35	00:38:38	Well, I hope it's for a good reason 'cause I'm a busy man.
561	00:38:38	00:38:40	Yes, you are.
562	00:38:40	00:38:44	You wanted information on Suvari.
563	00:38:44	00:38:46	Well, we-we found him.
564	00:38:46	00:38:51	But then again, I think you know that, because you found him first, didn't you?
565	00:38:51	00:38:53	His real name is Joseph Powers.
566	00:38:53	00:38:55	Former Army Intelligence.
567	00:38:55	00:38:58	More recently employed by Ceressus Logistics.
568	00:38:58	00:39:03	He was a-a contractor assigned to Project Jericho, wasn't he?
569	00:39:03	00:39:05	I don't recognize him.
570	00:39:05	00:39:07	But then again, I have a lot of people working under me.
571	00:39:07	00:39:11	How about Cheryl Perez?
572	00:39:11	00:39:13	You recognize her?
573	00:39:13	00:39:14	I heard about her car accident.
574	00:39:14	00:39:16	Tragic.
575	00:39:16	00:39:17	Yes, it was.
576	00:39:17	00:39:19	We were all deeply saddened.
577	00:39:19	00:39:22	Especially, evidentially, Joseph Powers.
578	00:39:22	00:39:26	I mean, he-he resigned a week after the accident.
579	00:39:26	00:39:31	He just fell right off the grid, until, of course, he started reaching out to John Merchiston.
580	00:39:31	00:39:33	You remember John, don't you?
581	00:39:33	00:39:35	Where's this going?
582	00:39:35	00:39:39	Did Cheryl Perez threaten to go to your wife or your boss?
583	00:39:39	00:39:42	Or did she want money to help support her child?
584	00:39:42	00:39:43	Your child?
585	00:39:43	00:39:49	A man with a good job and a family has so much to live for, right?
586	00:39:49	00:39:53	Or... kill for.
587	00:39:53	00:39:55	I would be very careful about what you say.
588	00:39:55	00:39:59	Why? Am I about to have a car accident?
589	00:39:59	00:40:08	See, I know what you've done. You've used the entire national security apparatus, all of their technology, to cover up an affair.
590	00:40:08	00:40:09	You don't know what I've done.
591	00:40:12	00:40:14	And even if you did, you wouldn't understand.
592	00:40:14	00:40:17	You're not a soldier, a patriot.
593	00:40:17	00:40:26	You are just another child of the '60s who cloaks himself in principle, while our enemies plot to bring chaos to our streets.
594	00:40:26	00:40:28	Well, I am not gonna let that happen.
595	00:40:28	00:40:33	And I will stop anybody who gets in my way.
596	00:40:33	00:40:39	You know, my-my hippie parents might not have taught me a lot, but they did teach me about patience.
597	00:40:39	00:40:45	I may not be able to prove anything today, but you have involved way too many people here, General.
598	00:40:45	00:40:55	And someday, there's gonna be another Joseph Powers, another person of conscience, and when they step up, oh, I'm going to be right there, waiting patiently for you.
599	00:40:56	00:40:58	You're dismissed, General.
600	00:41:02	00:41:05	I thought your flight left in the morning.
601	00:41:05	00:41:07	So did I.
602	00:41:07	00:41:09	The editor needs to see me immediately.
603	00:41:09	00:41:11	Mm.
604	00:41:13	00:41:15	It's the truth. I believe you.
605	00:41:15	00:41:20	Russell is not giving up on Lansdale, and neither am I.
606	00:41:20	00:41:22	I'll be back.
607	00:41:22	00:41:24	Good to know.
608	00:41:26	00:41:29	Look, uh...
609	00:41:29	00:41:40	that thing that, uh, you didn't want to talk about-- should you ever change your mind, I'm an excellent listener.
610	00:41:42	00:41:45	Thank you. I appreciate that.
611	00:41:45	00:41:47	Yeah.
612	00:41:47	00:41:49	Be safe.
613	00:41:49	00:41:51	Yeah. You, too.
614	00:41:59	00:42:01	Be well.
615	00:42:01	00:42:03	Yeah. You, too.
