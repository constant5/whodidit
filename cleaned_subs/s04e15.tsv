1	1	00:00:18	00:00:19	I'll get the paper. You get the car.	N
2	2	00:00:19	00:00:20	Okay.	N
3	3	00:00:42	00:00:43	Ooh!	Y
4	4	00:00:55	00:00:59	Early morning call-out, the worst.	N
5	5	00:00:59	00:01:00	Where did you come from?	N
6	6	00:01:00	00:01:01	Home.	N
7	7	00:01:01	00:01:03	Did you get any sleep?	N
8	8	00:01:03	00:01:04	No. You?	N
9	9	00:01:04	00:01:05	About a half an hour.	N
10	10	00:01:05	00:01:07	I was watching the World Series of Poker.	N
11	11	00:01:07	00:01:10	Waiting for Sam Farha to light his cigarette.	N
12	12	00:01:10	00:01:12	Ever been to the Acid Drop?	N
13	13	00:01:12	00:01:15	I try to avoid those places.	N
14	14	00:01:15	00:01:17	The victims were the owners.	N
15	15	00:01:17	00:01:20	Mike Trent and his wife Laurel.	N
16	16	00:01:20	00:01:23	Both shot execution-style back of the head.	N
17	17	00:01:23	00:01:25	A neighbor walking the dog found 'em.	N
18	18	00:01:25	00:01:29	Mike used to own a semi-pro hockey team with some other guy.	N
19	19	00:01:29	00:01:34	He made a ton of money, sunk it all into clubs like Acid Drop, uh, Psychedelic Hoe-Down...	N
20	20	00:01:34	00:01:35	Captain Brass.	N
21	21	00:01:35	00:01:37	Fun joints.	Y
22	22	00:01:37	00:01:40	Looks like they never got out of the driveway.	N
23	23	00:01:43	00:01:49	She dropped where she was shot, but he looks like he was dragged.	Y
24	24	00:01:52	00:01:58	You drag a body away to hide it, not down a driveway for the world to see it.	N
25	25	00:01:59	00:02:09	Unless that was the point.	N
26	26	00:02:45	00:02:47	Bling-bling.	N
27	27	00:02:47	00:02:49	The ol' trophy wife.	N
28	28	00:02:49	00:02:51	You think?	N
29	29	00:02:51	00:02:54	Classic Vegas.	N
30	30	00:02:54	00:03:01	He pays for her boobs, tummy tuck, Prada, weekly spa, French manicure.	N
31	31	00:03:01	00:03:06	And she's just hanging on his arm like she belongs.	N
32	32	00:03:06	00:03:08	Tell us how you really feel, Catherine.	N
33	33	00:03:08	00:03:09	Oh, it's gross.	N
34	34	00:03:09	00:03:11	I wouldn't want to be her for the world.	N
35	35	00:03:11	00:03:14	I wouldn't mind being her for a day, I guess.	N
36	36	00:03:14	00:03:15	Not this day.	N
37	37	00:03:15	00:03:16	No.	N
38	38	00:03:16	00:03:19	Looks like it was just the two of them.	N
39	39	00:03:19	00:03:21	Nobody I know lives like this with kids.	N
40	40	00:03:24	00:03:26	Brown.	N
41	41	00:03:26	00:03:28	I've been here for 20 minutes.	N
42	42	00:03:28	00:03:29	What's the code?	N
43	43	00:03:29	00:03:31	You on the East Coast looking for a sunset?	N
44	44	00:03:31	00:03:33	I am.	N
45	45	00:03:33	00:03:34	You're at the wrong gate.	N
46	46	00:03:34	00:03:37	Drive back down the road, make three lefts.	N
47	47	00:03:37	00:03:42	When you get to the main gate, speak to Officer Ray and tell her you're with the Crime Lab.	N
48	48	00:03:42	00:03:45	When you get to the scene, make sure I'm the first person you speak to.	N
49	49	00:03:45	00:03:46	Okay.	N
50	50	00:03:51	00:03:51	Mike Trent?	N
51	51	00:03:52	00:03:53	Mm-hmm.	N
52	52	00:03:53	00:03:56	Boy, he's a big dog in the club world.	N
53	53	00:03:56	00:04:01	You know I heard he paid Lil' Kim $10,000 one time just to walk into one of his clubs, turn around and walk back out.	N
54	54	00:04:01	00:04:04	Yeah, Jah Rule gets the same fee.	N
55	55	00:04:04	00:04:08	He told me.	N
56	56	00:04:08	00:04:10	Hey, uh, let me have one of those, Sara.	N
57	57	00:04:10	00:04:12	Sorry, last one.	N
58	58	00:04:13	00:04:15	You have a cold, Sara?	N
59	59	00:04:15	00:04:17	I've been feeling a little run-down lately.	N
60	60	00:04:17	00:04:19	Okay, it's a gated community.	N
61	61	00:04:19	00:04:21	The main gate has a guard all the time.	N
62	62	00:04:21	00:04:25	The resident gate is at the north end, has punch-key access.	N
63	63	00:04:25	00:04:28	Those are the only two ways in and out of this place.	N
64	64	00:04:28	00:04:31	I thought you moved into communities like this for this not to happen.	N
65	65	00:04:32	00:04:35	Hey, Grissom.	Y
66	66	00:04:35	00:04:36	What do you got?	N
67	67	00:04:36	00:04:39	So far, an empty briefcase and a purse.	N
68	68	00:04:39	00:04:41	You want us to take the perimeter?	N
69	69	00:04:41	00:04:42	Yeah, please.	N
70	70	00:04:42	00:04:44	Catherine and Warwick are inside.	N
71	71	00:04:44	00:04:47	The bodies were found on the driveway, so any evidence of the killers is going to be out here.	N
72	72	00:04:47	00:04:51	I'll check the rear for any sign of forced entry.	N
73	73	00:04:51	00:04:54	I'll take the side door.	N
74	74	00:04:54	00:04:56	You just get off a shift?	N
75	75	00:04:57	00:04:58	Catherine called me.	N
76	76	00:04:58	00:04:59	I'm here to help with the case.	N
77	77	00:04:59	00:05:01	You look like a man who just rolled out of bed.	N
78	78	00:05:01	00:05:03	You all right? Yeah, why?	N
79	79	00:05:03	00:05:04	T-shirt, sneakers.	N
80	80	00:05:04	00:05:05	You're already a half hour late.	N
81	81	00:05:05	00:05:08	Grissom will rip you a new one he sees you like that.	N
82	82	00:05:08	00:05:09	Serious?	N
83	83	00:05:09	00:05:12	Yeah, it's not a Rebel game. It's a crime scene.	N
84	84	00:05:12	00:05:15	See, this is what I'm talking about right here.	N
85	85	00:05:15	00:05:18	The battery's not changed out of your flashlight.	N
86	86	00:05:18	00:05:19	Kit's open.	N
87	87	00:05:20	00:05:22	It's not stocked; no swabs.	N
88	88	00:05:22	00:05:24	Did you sterilize your equipment after your last case?	N
89	89	00:05:24	00:05:26	Uh, no.	N
90	90	00:05:28	00:05:31	See, you know when I'm on call because my clothes are folded next to my bed.	N
91	91	00:05:31	00:05:36	Shoes, jacket, ball cap, bottle of water, pen, paper, Thomas Guide, next to the phone.	N
92	92	00:05:36	00:05:39	00 in the morning, I'm not scrambled.	N
93	93	00:05:39	00:05:42	Everything's there before the phone rings.	N
94	94	00:05:42	00:05:43	My game is tight, like my trunk.	N
95	95	00:05:43	00:05:44	Check it out.	N
96	96	00:05:50	00:05:53	Camera case, tripod, film is in the fridge.	N
97	97	00:05:53	00:05:54	Markers, check.	N
98	98	00:05:54	00:05:56	Extra field kit, fully stocked, sterilized.	N
99	99	00:05:56	00:06:00	Shoeprint lift kit, wet weather gear.	N
100	100	00:06:00	00:06:01	Files mama.	N
101	101	00:06:04	00:06:05	Forms for days.	N
102	102	00:06:05	00:06:10	First Call form, First Officer form, Consent to Search, Bird's Eye View inside, Bird's Eye View outside.	N
103	103	00:06:11	00:06:13	It's down to how I like my lunch.	N
104	104	00:06:13	00:06:14	Picking up what I'm putting down?	N
105	105	00:06:14	00:06:17	Yeah. See, no one ever told me.	N
106	106	00:06:17	00:06:18	You've been told.	N
107	107	00:06:18	00:06:20	Yes, sir.	N
108	108	00:07:12	00:07:13	No sign of disturbance in the rear.	Y
109	109	00:07:14	00:07:17	Cigarette butts.	N
110	110	00:07:17	00:07:19	Orange peel, seeds.	N
111	111	00:07:19	00:07:22	Lying in wait, maybe.	N
112	112	00:07:22	00:07:24	You still sucking on that same cough drop?	N
113	113	00:07:24	00:07:26	Yeah.	N
114	114	00:07:26	00:07:28	I'm a... a slow sucker.	N
115	115	00:07:28	00:07:33	So, assuming the killer didn't live in the community, how did he gain entry?	Y
116	116	00:08:19	00:08:20	Crime occurred in the driveway.	N
117	117	00:08:20	00:08:23	Nothing to indicate that the suspects were inside the house.	N
118	118	00:08:23	00:08:27	Yes, ma'am. I got it.	N
119	119	00:08:27	00:08:28	So, then, what are we looking for?	N
120	120	00:08:28	00:08:32	Anything inside that'll make the outside make sense.	N
121	121	00:08:32	00:08:33	On your hands and knees.	N
122	122	00:08:33	00:08:36	Check the carpet for trace.	N
123	123	00:09:06	00:09:08	Hey.	N
124	124	00:09:08	00:09:10	Greg.	N
125	125	00:09:10	00:09:12	I'm going to need you to photograph something.	N
126	126	00:09:12	00:09:13	Why, what'd you find?	N
127	127	00:09:14	00:09:15	It's what I didn't find.	N
128	128	00:09:18	00:09:19	Well, I found something.	N
129	129	00:09:19	00:09:21	Blood.	N
130	130	00:09:21	00:09:22	Blood?	N
131	131	00:09:22	00:09:24	Where?	N
132	132	00:09:24	00:09:26	Right here.	N
133	133	00:09:31	00:09:34	Ooh, I also found some videos.	N
134	134	00:09:34	00:09:37	Looks like amateur porn.	N
135	135	00:09:37	00:09:41	Porn. That figures.	N
136	136	00:09:41	00:09:44	Sunburn Sin. Ooh.	N
137	137	00:09:44	00:09:47	Starring Laurel Lust.	N
138	138	00:09:47	00:09:51	That's Laurel Trent.	N
139	139	00:09:51	00:09:53	Isn't that the wife?	N
140	140	00:09:53	00:09:54	Yeah.	N
141	141	00:09:54	00:09:56	A few years back.	N
142	142	00:09:56	00:09:58	A Goode/Mike T. Production.	N
143	143	00:09:58	00:10:03	Mike T as in Mike Trent?	N
144	144	00:10:03	00:10:08	Well, I bet he seduced her, and then he produced her.	N
145	145	00:10:08	00:10:11	Laurel Trent definitely had some work done.	N
146	146	00:10:11	00:10:13	Implants which she later had removed.	N
147	147	00:10:13	00:10:17	She has a four- centimeter-long scar at the edge of the areola.	N
148	148	00:10:17	00:10:20	Collapsed fibrous capsules in both breasts.	Y
149	149	00:10:20	00:10:21	Fascinating.	Y
150	150	00:10:21	00:10:22	Cause of death?	N
151	151	00:10:22	00:10:24	I was just getting to that.	N
152	152	00:10:24	00:10:27	Two gunshot wounds to the back of the head, just like her husband.	Y
153	153	00:10:27	00:10:29	Close range.	Y
154	154	00:10:29	00:10:31	Either one immediately debilitating and fatal.	Y
155	155	00:10:31	00:10:33	I sent the bullets to the lab.	N
156	156	00:10:33	00:10:36	But this is why I sent for you.	N
157	157	00:10:42	00:10:44	Stun gun burns?	Y
158	158	00:10:48	00:10:51	If you're close enough to stun him, you're close enough to shoot him.	N
159	159	00:10:52	00:10:55	And we suspect that there were two assailants.	N
160	160	00:10:55	00:10:58	Well, maybe they were trying to buy time.	N
161	161	00:10:58	00:11:02	For what?	N
162	162	00:11:04	00:11:06	Now, the first order of business is to kill the Trents.	N
163	163	00:11:07	00:11:10	Then the suspects go upstairs and rip off Laurel's jewelry.	N
164	164	00:11:10	00:11:12	And bail on bikes.	N
165	165	00:11:12	00:11:14	That's a little low-rent, don't you think?	N
166	166	00:11:14	00:11:19	Yeah, but I'm thinking, in a neighborhood like this, if you burn rubber out of here, it's gonna cause a lot of attention.	N
167	167	00:11:19	00:11:21	If you roll quietly away on a bike, though...	N
168	168	00:11:21	00:11:24	Ah, no one's the wiser. Okay, I get it.	N
169	169	00:11:24	00:11:27	This is the resident gate that Greg called me from; he couldn't get in.	N
170	170	00:11:27	00:11:31	He needed a code. Sara did find an orange peel in the side yard.	N
171	171	00:11:31	00:11:33	What do you think, sticky fingers?	N
172	172	00:11:33	00:11:35	Does citrus illuminate?	N
173	173	00:11:35	00:11:37	Sugar will, if it's derivatized.	N
174	174	00:11:38	00:11:39	Do you have any fluorescent reagents?	N
175	175	00:11:39	00:11:40	I've got ANTS.	N
176	176	00:11:41	00:11:44	Not the insect. Amino-naphthalene Trisulfonic acid. trisulfonic acid.	N
177	177	00:11:44	00:11:45	You're trying to stump me. I can feel it.	N
178	178	00:11:46	00:11:47	Let me check it out.	N
179	179	00:11:51	00:11:54	The ANTS should make it light up under the ALS.	N
180	180	00:12:07	00:12:11	One, three...	N
181	181	00:12:11	00:12:13	five and six.	N
182	182	00:12:13	00:12:16	In some configuration.	N
183	183	00:12:16	00:12:18	They had the code.	N
184	184	00:12:18	00:12:21	We're mid-case. Why do we have to do this now?	N
185	185	00:12:21	00:12:25	I have to get this evaluation in, or I'm gonna get written up.	N
186	186	00:12:25	00:12:27	Okay.	N
187	187	00:12:27	00:12:29	My goals.	N
188	188	00:12:29	00:12:31	Mm...	N
189	189	00:12:31	00:12:32	Oh, all right, okay.	N
190	190	00:12:32	00:12:35	For starters, I'd like two consecutive nights off.	N
191	191	00:12:35	00:12:45	I would like to cut my triples down to ten a year instead of the usual 20, and, uh, I would love to find a reliable baby-sitter, so I could have myself some kind of a personal life.	N
192	192	00:12:45	00:12:48	You don't have a personal life?	N
193	193	00:12:50	00:12:54	I haven't had sex in six-- no-- seven months.	N
194	194	00:12:59	00:13:01	How can I help?	N
195	195	00:13:03	00:13:05	You. Advance, I mean.	N
196	196	00:13:05	00:13:07	Do you...	N
197	197	00:13:07	00:13:12	have any interest in changing sections in the lab, for instance? Gil, how do you do this?	N
198	198	00:13:12	00:13:16	Honestly, how do you juggle scheduling and vacations and...	N
199	199	00:13:16	00:13:21	The goal of any supervisor is to teach someone how to take his place someday.	N
200	200	00:13:21	00:13:23	Are you going someplace?	N
201	201	00:13:23	00:13:25	You never know.	N
202	202	00:13:25	00:13:26	Are you considering me?	N
203	203	00:13:26	00:13:28	Why not?	N
204	204	00:13:28	00:13:30	You're certainly qualified.	N
205	205	00:13:30	00:13:36	But... a CSI who uses the DNA lab to establish her own paternity...	N
206	206	00:13:36	00:13:42	calls into question... her judgment, don't you think?	N
207	207	00:13:51	00:13:54	You've left that out.	N
208	208	00:13:54	00:13:55	Are you covering for me?	N
209	209	00:13:55	00:14:00	I believe that we've dealt with this issue, handled it internally.	N
210	210	00:14:00	00:14:02	As far as I'm concerned, it's dead.	N
211	211	00:14:02	00:14:06	Besides, you'll never do it again.	N
212	212	00:14:06	00:14:09	So just sign your name by the red X.	N
213	213	00:14:11	00:14:18	Before I sign, um, since we're putting all of our cards on the table, there's something you should know.	N
214	214	00:14:18	00:14:25	Sam Braun wrote me a check, and... I cashed it.	N
215	215	00:14:27	00:14:30	For how much?	N
216	216	00:14:30	00:14:36	Enough to where Lindsay and I can do anything and...	N
217	217	00:14:36	00:14:39	not enough to where we can do nothing.	N
218	218	00:14:39	00:14:42	Sam Braun was a murder suspect in one of your cases.	N
219	219	00:14:42	00:14:44	How does this not look like a payoff?	N
220	220	00:14:44	00:14:45	I consulted an attorney.	N
221	221	00:14:45	00:14:47	It is a check from a father to a daughter.	N
222	222	00:14:47	00:14:49	It is completely out of departmental jurisdiction.	N
223	223	00:14:49	00:14:51	What about conflict of interest?	N
224	224	00:14:51	00:14:52	Not just for you but for this lab.	N
225	225	00:14:52	00:14:55	Gil, I would never compromise you or the lab.	N
226	226	00:14:55	00:14:58	Maybe not legally, but ethically?	N
227	227	00:15:03	00:15:07	What else should I know, Catherine?	N
228	228	00:15:07	00:15:09	That's everything.	N
229	229	00:15:24	00:15:25	Talk to me.	N
230	230	00:15:25	00:15:27	Orange peels, seeds, cigarette butts.	N
231	231	00:15:27	00:15:30	I'm logging them in and moving them to DNA.	N
232	232	00:15:30	00:15:34	Okay, so you've gone through her purse, uh, her wallet...	N
233	233	00:15:34	00:15:36	Yeah, everything's there-- money, credit cards.	N
234	234	00:15:36	00:15:38	Yeah. What about the briefcase?	N
235	235	00:15:38	00:15:40	Empty. Stop. I-I got a system here.	N
236	236	00:15:40	00:15:43	I found this wadded up in her purse.	N
237	237	00:15:43	00:15:46	It's a release form-- permission to film an adult movie at the Acid Drop.	N
238	238	00:15:46	00:15:48	From Drake the Snake Productions.	N
239	239	00:15:48	00:15:50	Signed by a Drake Snow.	N
240	240	00:16:12	00:16:14	I need to see your boss.	N
241	241	00:16:14	00:16:16	Follow me.	N
242	242	00:16:16	00:16:17	Tonight's for Mike.	N
243	243	00:16:17	00:16:21	We pay our respects by ringing the register.	N
244	244	00:16:21	00:16:26	Now, I don't mind if you're talking, just as long as they're drinking.	N
245	245	00:16:26	00:16:27	Watch the doubles...	N
246	246	00:16:27	00:16:30	Uh...	N
247	247	00:16:32	00:16:35	Watch the doubles. Be smart.	N
248	248	00:16:35	00:16:38	You do that, we're gonna take this party 00 in the morning.	N
249	249	00:16:38	00:16:39	And most importantly, have fun.	N
250	250	00:16:39	00:16:40	Okay.	N
251	251	00:16:40	00:16:43	Go make some money. See you later.	N
252	252	00:16:45	00:16:48	You here about Mike?	N
253	253	00:16:48	00:16:50	Yes, I am.	N
254	254	00:16:50	00:16:52	Let's go somewhere private.	N
255	255	00:16:52	00:16:54	Sorry for the inconvenience, everybody.	N
256	256	00:16:54	00:16:56	When you come back, next bottle's on me.	N
257	257	00:16:56	00:16:58	Go ahead. ( clears throat )	N
258	258	00:16:58	00:17:01	Thanks, Chief. We're going to shut her down for about half an hour.	Y
259	259	00:17:01	00:17:02	Well...	N
260	260	00:17:02	00:17:03	this is private.	Y
261	261	00:17:03	00:17:05	It was, um...	Y
262	262	00:17:05	00:17:07	It was a real shock, you know?	Y
263	263	00:17:07	00:17:09	Mike and Laurel getting killed like that.	Y
264	264	00:17:09	00:17:14	But I got to say, if they had a choice how to go out, it would have been together.	N
265	265	00:17:14	00:17:17	For him, the sun rose and set with her.	N
266	266	00:17:17	00:17:20	He didn't treat her like a trophy wife?	N
267	267	00:17:20	00:17:22	No. You kidding?	N
268	268	00:17:22	00:17:27	No. He got her off the VHS covers, and she made a home for him.	N
269	269	00:17:27	00:17:28	You know?	N
270	270	00:17:28	00:17:30	Have a seat.	N
271	271	00:17:32	00:17:34	Um, and what was, uh...	N
272	272	00:17:34	00:17:37	What was your professional affiliation with him?	N
273	273	00:17:37	00:17:40	I run his clubs.	N
274	274	00:17:40	00:17:43	Ever since he got out of the partner business with Kyle Goode.	N
275	275	00:17:44	00:17:48	Have you seen this Mr. Goode lately?	N
276	276	00:17:48	00:17:50	He shows his face every once in a while.	N
277	277	00:17:50	00:17:52	I just try to keep him away from Mike, you know?	N
278	278	00:17:52	00:17:54	As much as humanly possible.	Y
279	279	00:17:55	00:17:57	And...	N
280	280	00:17:57	00:18:00	what about this Drake Snow guy?	N
281	281	00:18:00	00:18:01	Drake?	N
282	282	00:18:01	00:18:02	Drake the Snake.	N
283	283	00:18:02	00:18:04	I, uh...	N
284	284	00:18:04	00:18:05	I hired him. He's harmless.	N
285	285	00:18:05	00:18:07	He saw one Ron Jeremy movie.	Y
286	286	00:18:07	00:18:09	Now the guy just sees dollar signs.	Y
287	287	00:18:11	00:18:14	Uh, and how did he get along with the Trents?	N
288	288	00:18:14	00:18:16	Why don't you go ask him?	N
289	289	00:18:16	00:18:18	Reading my mind.	N
290	290	00:18:18	00:18:20	Mm.	N
291	291	00:18:21	00:18:22	You, uh...	N
292	292	00:18:23	00:18:24	You never gave me your name.	N
293	293	00:18:24	00:18:25	Oh.	N
294	294	00:18:25	00:18:26	Catherine.	N
295	295	00:18:26	00:18:28	Catherine.	N
296	296	00:18:28	00:18:29	Willows.	N
297	297	00:18:30	00:18:32	Chris Bezich.	N
298	298	00:18:32	00:18:34	Chris Bezich.	N
299	299	00:18:34	00:18:36	Come on.	N
300	300	00:18:36	00:18:39	Mike and Kyle-- they made all their money out of Laurel taking it off.	N
301	301	00:18:39	00:18:42	She-She was a cash register in panties is what she was.	N
302	302	00:18:42	00:18:44	And you wanted in?	N
303	303	00:18:44	00:18:45	No. Trust me.	N
304	304	00:18:45	00:18:48	The last thing that I wanted was to be partners with Mike.	N
305	305	00:18:48	00:18:51	Guy'd... Guy'd chew you up and spit you out soon as look at you.	N
306	306	00:18:51	00:18:52	And Kyle-- forget it.	N
307	307	00:18:52	00:18:55	Guy'd tell you right to your face he's sticking it to you.	N
308	308	00:18:55	00:18:56	Pasadena, baby.	N
309	309	00:18:56	00:18:58	I got my own plans.	N
310	310	00:18:58	00:18:59	I-I just... I just need a location.	N
311	311	00:18:59	00:19:01	One location.	N
312	312	00:19:01	00:19:02	And what?	N
313	313	00:19:02	00:19:05	Mike didn't agree to it?	N
314	314	00:19:05	00:19:06	Didn't ask him.	N
315	315	00:19:06	00:19:09	Last time I asked him for something, he took a swing at me.	N
316	316	00:19:10	00:19:10	Get the hell out of my...	N
317	317	00:19:10	00:19:13	I just want the same shot that you had, Mike.	N
318	318	00:19:13	00:19:14	Laurel said that...	N
319	319	00:19:14	00:19:15	You two aren't in business anymore.	N
320	320	00:19:17	00:19:19	In the kitchen, you said?	N
321	321	00:19:20	00:19:21	Yeah.	N
322	322	00:19:21	00:19:24	So, I wasn't going to make that mistake again, so I had to try something different.	N
323	323	00:19:24	00:19:25	So, I pulled a Geffen.	N
324	324	00:19:25	00:19:26	I went straight to Yoko.	N
325	325	00:19:26	00:19:30	Oh, you gave Laurel the release form.	N
326	326	00:19:30	00:19:32	Yeah. She was going to give it to Mike.	N
327	327	00:19:32	00:19:35	He was going to sign it, and they were going to get it back to me.	N
328	328	00:19:35	00:19:36	So much for that.	N
329	329	00:19:36	00:19:37	All right. So, uh, listen, Drake.	N
330	330	00:19:37	00:19:39	I'm going to help you get that dream shot.	N
331	331	00:19:39	00:19:44	So that when you do get into the porn biz, you won't have a murder rap hanging over your head.	N
332	332	00:19:44	00:19:46	Here.	N
333	333	00:19:46	00:19:47	Crime Scene 101.	N
334	334	00:19:48	00:19:50	Stick this in your mouth.	N
335	335	00:19:50	00:19:52	Hey, you can set 'em right there.	N
336	336	00:19:52	00:19:56	Can't believe that there's this many abandoned bikes in Charleston Hills.	N
337	337	00:19:56	00:20:01	These were found in the alley behind the Fire Department, so check them out.	N
338	338	00:20:14	00:20:16	Sugar on the handlebars of both bikes.	N
339	339	00:20:16	00:20:17	Just like the keypad.	N
340	340	00:20:18	00:20:19	So we may have our getaway bikes.	N
341	341	00:20:19	00:20:22	We could check the serial numbers, but they're usually not recorded.	Y
342	342	00:20:26	00:20:28	You know what? I got an idea.	N
343	343	00:20:28	00:20:31	Hmm?	Y
344	344	00:20:31	00:20:33	What are you doing?	N
345	345	00:20:38	00:20:40	Get me a pair of tweezers, will you?	N
346	346	00:20:51	00:20:53	Now how did you know that receipt was in there?	N
347	347	00:20:53	00:20:54	Well, I used to read point spreads.	N
348	348	00:20:55	00:20:55	Now I read books.	N
349	349	00:20:56	00:20:57	Good for you.	N
350	350	00:20:57	00:21:00	Bad for Ross Davis, though.	N
351	351	00:21:02	00:21:04	This is a little intense for getting my bike stolen.	N
352	352	00:21:04	00:21:06	I already got a new one.	N
353	353	00:21:06	00:21:07	Did you report it?	N
354	354	00:21:07	00:21:08	No. You're kidding me, right?	N
355	355	00:21:08	00:21:10	I got jumped, man.	N
356	356	00:21:10	00:21:11	By whom?	N
357	357	00:21:11	00:21:12	By two bucked-ass brothers.	N
358	358	00:21:12	00:21:14	They were both yoked as hell.	N
359	359	00:21:14	00:21:15	Ripped.	N
360	360	00:21:15	00:21:17	I thought for a second they were going to kill me.	N
361	361	00:21:19	00:21:20	Hey, hey.	N
362	362	00:21:24	00:21:25	Something wrong with your neck?	Y
363	363	00:21:25	00:21:26	Man, it's killing me.	Y
364	364	00:21:26	00:21:31	I don't know what the hell they hit me with, but my knees was the first to go.	Y
365	365	00:21:33	00:21:35	I believe you were hit with a stun gun.	N
366	366	00:21:35	00:21:37	Just like Mike Trent.	N
367	367	00:21:44	00:21:45	I found something on your butt.	N
368	368	00:21:45	00:21:47	Checking out my butt again, Greg?	N
369	369	00:21:47	00:21:48	I was.	N
370	370	00:21:48	00:21:51	As well as the four butts Sara got at the crime scene.	N
371	371	00:21:51	00:21:52	Oh.	N
372	372	00:21:52	00:21:55	Found something on them that I can't explain, so I sent them over to Hodges.	N
373	373	00:21:55	00:21:57	Your butt's fine.	N
374	374	00:21:58	00:21:59	Switching gears.	N
375	375	00:21:59	00:22:02	Blood found in the Trents' bedroom is a match to Drake Snow.	N
376	376	00:22:02	00:22:06	So he told the truth about the blood and lied about the kitchen.	N
377	377	00:22:06	00:22:07	Figures.	N
378	378	00:22:07	00:22:11	Three of the four cigarette butts are also a match to Drake.	N
379	379	00:22:11	00:22:12	Puts him at the scene.	N
380	380	00:22:12	00:22:14	And the fourth butt?	N
381	381	00:22:14	00:22:17	Female, not a match to Laurel Trent.	N
382	382	00:22:17	00:22:18	Orange seeds?	N
383	383	00:22:18	00:22:19	Two additional donors, both male.	N
384	384	00:22:19	00:22:21	Not a match to any of our players.	N
385	385	00:22:21	00:22:23	No hits on CODIS.	N
386	386	00:22:23	00:22:26	So we're looking for two guys and a gal who might know Drake.	N
387	387	00:22:26	00:22:28	We already know you lied.	N
388	388	00:22:28	00:22:32	We found your blood in the Trents' bedroom, not in the kitchen.	N
389	389	00:22:32	00:22:34	So what were you doing in there?	N
390	390	00:22:34	00:22:36	You putting the shot in her, or what?	N
391	391	00:22:36	00:22:37	Hey, look.	N
392	392	00:22:38	00:22:39	I know where you're going with this.	N
393	393	00:22:40	00:22:42	Okay, I was in the bedroom.	N
394	394	00:22:42	00:22:45	She wasn't on her knees. I was.	N
395	395	00:22:45	00:22:47	I was begging. Not for sex.	N
396	396	00:22:47	00:22:49	I was begging for my business.	N
397	397	00:22:50	00:22:51	Drake the Snake Productions.	N
398	398	00:22:51	00:22:55	Mike comes busting in, goes ballistic, smacks me in the nose...	N
399	399	00:22:55	00:23:00	I mean, I know I keep coming back to this three-and-out thing, but maybe because you're in bed with his wife.	N
400	400	00:23:00	00:23:02	Laurel and I didn't have sex in the bedroom.	N
401	401	00:23:02	00:23:06	We had it on the set-- past tense, long time ago.	N
402	402	00:23:06	00:23:07	Then along came Mike.	N
403	403	00:23:07	00:23:09	Mike was good for Laurel.	N
404	404	00:23:09	00:23:11	Mike was not good for me.	N
405	405	00:23:11	00:23:13	She got carte blanche-- Laurel.	N
406	406	00:23:13	00:23:14	Me, I got a bar back.	N
407	407	00:23:14	00:23:18	Now I'm popping blue pills looking for something to bring me down, but I know the business.	N
408	408	00:23:18	00:23:21	I just don't have the capital to get behind the camera.	N
409	409	00:23:21	00:23:23	So what does killing the Trents get you?	N
410	410	00:23:25	00:23:27	Zero.	N
411	411	00:23:27	00:23:31	No one was more upset than me.	N
412	412	00:23:31	00:23:33	You're still pouring drinks. Boo-hoo.	N
413	413	00:23:33	00:23:36	And what are you doing smoking around their place?	N
414	414	00:23:38	00:23:39	What?	N
415	415	00:23:39	00:23:42	Yeah, we found cigarette butts with your DNA on it on their property.	N
416	416	00:23:42	00:23:45	I don't know what you're talking about.	N
417	417	00:23:45	00:23:46	I don't.	N
418	418	00:23:46	00:23:48	I smoke one place, okay?	N
419	419	00:23:48	00:23:50	I smoke at work.	N
420	420	00:23:50	00:23:51	I'm down to one a day.	N
421	421	00:23:51	00:23:55	Right after happy hour, I have my one cigarette, and it's out back by the service register.	N
422	422	00:23:55	00:23:56	You ask anybody.	N
423	423	00:23:58	00:24:00	Drake's telling the truth, you know?	N
424	424	00:24:00	00:24:01	He smokes one a day.	N
425	425	00:24:01	00:24:03	Not on the floor, right here, my rule.	N
426	426	00:24:04	00:24:07	Mm-hmm, well, still have to verify it with evidence.	N
427	427	00:24:10	00:24:12	You verify everything?	N
428	428	00:24:12	00:24:15	Everything.	N
429	429	00:24:15	00:24:17	Including you.	N
430	430	00:24:17	00:24:20	You're clear.	N
431	431	00:24:20	00:24:23	Can you blame Drake, you know?	N
432	432	00:24:24	00:24:26	He's trying to give up cigarettes.	N
433	433	00:24:26	00:24:28	That's like me trying to give up...	N
434	434	00:24:28	00:24:30	Sex?	N
435	435	00:24:30	00:24:34	Everybody needs to indulge in a vice at least once a day, right?	N
436	436	00:24:34	00:24:40	Yes, well, I did happen to notice those little waitress girlies trying to serve their way into bed with you.	N
437	437	00:24:40	00:24:43	That's work.	N
438	438	00:24:43	00:24:45	I prefer women.	N
439	439	00:24:45	00:24:48	Speaking of work, do you, um...	N
440	440	00:24:48	00:24:50	ever get a day off?	N
441	441	00:24:54	00:24:55	What?	N
442	442	00:24:55	00:24:57	You want to get to know me?	N
443	443	00:24:57	00:24:59	Yes.	N
444	444	00:25:12	00:25:13	Um...	N
445	445	00:25:13	00:25:15	What?	N
446	446	00:25:15	00:25:16	Wait. Hang on.	N
447	447	00:25:17	00:25:18	I'm on the clock.	N
448	448	00:25:21	00:25:23	You started it.	N
449	449	00:25:23	00:25:26	Yes, and when the time is right, maybe I'll finish it.	N
450	450	00:25:38	00:25:39	How you feeling?	N
451	451	00:25:39	00:25:41	Hey. What do you mean?	N
452	452	00:25:41	00:25:44	Well, you were popping cough drops at the scene the other day a mile a minute.	N
453	453	00:25:44	00:25:46	I thought I was coming down with a cold.	N
454	454	00:25:46	00:25:48	Ah.	N
455	455	00:25:48	00:25:50	Yeah, I, uh...	N
456	456	00:25:50	00:25:53	I understand colds.	N
457	457	00:25:53	00:26:00	You know, back in Jersey when I was getting it from both ends, from my wife and my work, things started to get heavy.	N
458	458	00:26:00	00:26:03	I started medicating.	N
459	459	00:26:03	00:26:05	Cure my cold.	N
460	460	00:26:05	00:26:13	And, um, and God forbid I had an early morning roll-out and I had that tell-tale breath, you know what I mean?	N
461	461	00:26:13	00:26:19	So I would dodge my supe, and I started popping cough drops.	N
462	462	00:26:19	00:26:22	Huh.	N
463	463	00:26:22	00:26:25	I mean, what I'm trying to say is that...	Y
464	464	00:26:25	00:26:30	there's more problems than answers in the bottom of a bottle, believe me.	N
465	465	00:26:31	00:26:33	Yeah. ( sighs )	Y
466	466	00:26:33	00:26:40	Actually, I had a couple of beers with breakfast when I got off shift.	N
467	467	00:26:40	00:26:43	And then I got called in.	N
468	468	00:26:43	00:26:45	Just a couple?	N
469	469	00:26:45	00:26:47	Yeah.	N
470	470	00:26:49	00:26:50	I'm just looking out for you.	N
471	471	00:27:00	00:27:02	Hey, what are you doing after work?	N
472	472	00:27:02	00:27:04	More work.	N
473	473	00:27:04	00:27:06	You got photos of Laurel Trents' jewelry, huh?	N
474	474	00:27:06	00:27:14	Yeah, two-carat diamond earrings, ruby necklace, diamond and sapphire bracelet, lady's gold Rolex.	Y
475	475	00:27:14	00:27:16	The insurance company says it's worth somewhere north of two mil.	Y
476	476	00:27:17	00:27:20	I got every pawn shop in town on the lookout.	N
477	477	00:27:20	00:27:21	What?	Y
478	478	00:27:21	00:27:26	You know that feeling you get when you just can't quite put your finger on something?	Y
479	479	00:27:26	00:27:29	What can't you put your finger on besides the clock-out button?	Y
480	480	00:27:29	00:27:32	Why did they drag his body down the driveway?	Y
481	481	00:27:32	00:27:34	Dragging's your racket.	Y
482	482	00:27:34	00:27:37	But I can tell you who's dragging Mike Trent into court.	Y
483	483	00:27:37	00:27:39	His ex-business partner, Kyle Goode.	Y
484	484	00:27:39	00:27:41	Evidence.	Y
485	485	00:27:41	00:27:43	Evidence in context.	N
486	486	00:27:43	00:27:45	Take a look.	Y
487	487	00:27:48	00:27:52	Trace on the cigarette butt is a match to the sand I collected from the ashtray.	Y
488	488	00:27:52	00:27:53	At Acid Drop.	N
489	489	00:27:53	00:27:56	Now...	Y
490	490	00:27:56	00:27:58	take a look at this.	N
491	491	00:27:58	00:28:04	I found trace amounts of soil in the orange seeds and the orange peel, but not on any of the butts.	Y
492	492	00:28:04	00:28:06	So it's possible that the butts were planted.	Y
493	493	00:28:10	00:28:13	May explain why there seems to be so many suspects at the crime scene.	N
494	494	00:28:13	00:28:17	Probably clears Drake Snow and your unidentified female smoker.	N
495	495	00:28:17	00:28:19	Where does that leave you?	Y
496	496	00:28:19	00:28:21	With two guys on bikes.	N
497	497	00:28:25	00:28:26	Hit that ninja.	Y
498	498	00:28:26	00:28:27	On the bridge.	N
499	499	00:28:27	00:28:28	That's it.	N
500	500	00:28:29	00:28:30	Kyle Goode?	N
501	501	00:28:30	00:28:31	Uh-huh.	N
502	502	00:28:31	00:28:33	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Homicide.	N
503	503	00:28:33	00:28:36	I was wondering when you guys would get around to me.	Y
504	504	00:28:36	00:28:38	Why's that?	Y
505	505	00:28:38	00:28:39	My ex-partner's murdered.	N
506	506	00:28:39	00:28:42	I got a lawsuit against him. He owes me millions.	Y
507	507	00:28:42	00:28:43	I'd like me for it.	N
508	508	00:28:43	00:28:46	Great, then we won't have to pull teeth to get to the truth.	N
509	509	00:28:46	00:28:48	Where were you yesterday morning?	N
510	510	00:28:48	00:28:50	With my son, Alex.	N
511	511	00:28:50	00:28:52	Where?	N
512	512	00:28:54	00:28:56	You're not going to believe anything I tell you.	N
513	513	00:28:56	00:28:57	Why don't you ask him?	N
514	514	00:28:57	00:28:59	Okay. Come, Alex.	N
515	515	00:28:59	00:29:00	Get off the game.	N
516	516	00:29:00	00:29:01	That's enough.	N
517	517	00:29:01	00:29:03	You cost me a man.	N
518	518	00:29:03	00:29:04	I got more quarters.	N
519	519	00:29:07	00:29:09	So, Alex, where were you yesterday morning?	Y
520	520	00:29:09	00:29:10	At Grandma's.	Y
521	521	00:29:10	00:29:12	All morning?	Y
522	522	00:29:12	00:29:13	No.	Y
523	523	00:29:13	00:29:15	She lives in Laughlin.	Y
524	524	00:29:15	00:29:16	My dad drove me.	Y
525	525	00:29:16	00:29:17	What time did you get there?	Y
526	526	00:29:18	00:29:19	I don't know. I was sleeping.	Y
527	527	00:29:19	00:29:21	00?	Y
528	528	00:29:21	00:29:23	You sure about that?	Y
529	529	00:29:23	00:29:25	Yeah.	Y
530	530	00:29:25	00:29:27	When I woke up, Captain Caveman was on.	Y
531	531	00:29:27	00:29:31	Okay, Laughlin's about 21/////2 hours away, 30?	Y
532	532	00:29:32	00:29:33	00.	N
533	533	00:29:33	00:29:35	Alex likes those breakfast sandwiches.	N
534	534	00:29:35	00:29:36	We picked a couple up. Ate them on the way.	N
535	535	00:29:36	00:29:37	Where'd you pick them up?	N
536	536	00:29:37	00:29:39	Sunny Side's over on Eastern.	N
537	537	00:29:39	00:29:41	You looking for an alibi?	N
538	538	00:29:41	00:29:42	Something like that, yeah.	N
539	539	00:29:42	00:29:45	Come on, Alex. Let's go over to Circus Circus.	N
540	540	00:29:45	00:29:47	They got a real arcade.	Y
541	541	00:29:59	00:30:00	Thank you for visiting Sunny Side's.	N
542	542	00:30:00	00:30:02	Next in line, please. Hi.	N
543	543	00:30:02	00:30:03	Would you like to try the Sunny Side's Special?	N
544	544	00:30:03	00:30:04	No, I'm Nick Stokes.	N
545	545	00:30:04	00:30:06	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
546	546	00:30:06	00:30:07	Can I talk to you for a second?	N
547	547	00:30:07	00:30:08	Um...	N
548	548	00:30:12	00:30:14	Are you Missy Wilson?	Y
549	549	00:30:14	00:30:15	Are you a truant officer?	N
550	550	00:30:15	00:30:16	No.	N
551	551	00:30:17	00:30:21	Your manager said you were working breakfast the other day at the pick-up window.	N
552	552	00:30:21	00:30:22	Yeah.	N
553	553	00:30:22	00:30:24	Do you remember this guy?	N
554	554	00:30:24	00:30:26	Oh, my God.	N
555	555	00:30:26	00:30:29	That's the creep who was hitting on me.	N
556	556	00:30:29	00:30:31	He was so repulsive. You know what he said to me?	N
557	557	00:30:31	00:30:34	I'd like to bend you over the counter, baby.	N
558	558	00:30:36	00:30:38	And he said it in front of his kid.	Y
559	559	00:30:38	00:30:39	What kind of father acts like that?	N
560	560	00:30:40	00:30:41	Sounds like he wanted to make an impression.	N
561	561	00:30:41	00:30:42	Oh, he did.	N
562	562	00:30:42	00:30:44	I hope you're going to arrest him.	Y
563	563	00:30:44	00:30:45	One thing at a time.	Y
564	564	00:30:45	00:30:46	Now this window...	N
565	565	00:30:46	00:30:51	I get all the creeps in drive-through-- teenagers, perverts, walk-ups, and those are my favorites.	Y
566	566	00:30:51	00:30:52	Hi, I'm on a skateboard.	N
567	567	00:30:53	00:30:54	Can I have a burger combo? No, dork.	N
568	568	00:30:54	00:30:57	Does this window have a surveillance camera?	N
569	569	00:30:57	00:30:59	Oh, yeah, we have cameras all over here.	N
570	570	00:30:59	00:31:01	Even in the cooler.	Y
571	571	00:31:05	00:31:06	Confirms his alibi.	Y
572	572	00:31:06	00:31:09	Every suspect Brass leans on seems to have a case of the airtights.	Y
573	573	00:31:09	00:31:12	Hold it. Run that back.	N
574	574	00:31:16	00:31:17	Pause it.	N
575	575	00:31:19	00:31:21	What is that around the kid's neck?	Y
576	576	00:31:21	00:31:22	I don't know.	N
577	577	00:31:22	00:31:23	Let's enhance it.	N
578	578	00:31:30	00:31:32	Almost looks like a canteen.	N
579	579	00:31:33	00:31:38	You bring a canteen up to your lips, not to your eyes.	N
580	580	00:31:38	00:31:41	I'll pull some stills, see what I can make of it.	N
581	581	00:31:42	00:31:45	AV Lab. Grissom.	N
582	582	00:31:47	00:31:49	I'll be right there.	N
583	583	00:31:59	00:32:04	Well, he lived by the stun, but I don't think he died by it.	Y
584	584	00:32:04	00:32:05	He didn't.	N
585	585	00:32:05	00:32:09	Uh, two gunshot wounds to the back of the head.	N
586	586	00:32:09	00:32:10	TOD is within the hour.	N
587	587	00:32:10	00:32:13	Blood spatter everywhere.	N
588	588	00:32:15	00:32:18	Multiple directionalities.	N
589	589	00:32:22	00:32:23	You almost done, David?	N
590	590	00:32:23	00:32:24	Uh, yes, sir.	N
591	591	00:32:24	00:32:26	He's all yours.	N
592	592	00:32:26	00:32:27	Thanks.	N
593	593	00:32:27	00:32:29	I want to pick his pockets.	N
594	594	00:32:37	00:32:38	M...	N
595	595	00:32:38	00:32:40	and T.	N
596	596	00:32:41	00:32:42	Doesn't look like Michael Trent.	N
597	597	00:32:43	00:32:46	If he's one of our bad guys on the bicycle, where's his partner?	N
598	598	00:32:46	00:32:48	And where's the rest of the jewelry?	N
599	599	00:32:48	00:32:50	That's probably what his partner said before he tossed the room.	N
600	600	00:33:55	00:33:57	a knife with blood on it.	N
601	601	00:33:59	00:34:00	a dead guy.	N
602	602	00:34:04	00:34:08	Nine-millimeter.	N
603	603	00:34:08	00:34:10	Pillowcase full of jewelry.	N
604	604	00:34:14	00:34:18	Two stacks of $10,000 bricks.	N
605	605	00:34:18	00:34:24	Well, either they pawned some diamonds at the US Treasury, or they're on someone's payroll.	N
606	606	00:34:26	00:34:28	hit-for-hire.	N
607	607	00:34:28	00:34:32	And we're still looking for somebody.	N
608	608	00:34:34	00:34:35	him or him?	N
609	609	00:34:35	00:34:38	Eh, let's start with Mr. Head Wound.	N
610	610	00:34:38	00:34:41	You've seen these before.	N
611	611	00:34:41	00:34:42	Stun gun.	N
612	612	00:34:42	00:34:44	The debilitator of choice.	N
613	613	00:34:50	00:34:53	Heard you found a nine- millimeter at the scene?	N
614	614	00:34:53	00:34:55	Mm-hmm. I sent the bullets to ballistics.	N
615	615	00:34:55	00:34:58	How about his body? Any lead in him?	N
616	616	00:34:58	00:35:00	No, but he took a blade to the stomach.	N
617	617	00:35:01	00:35:05	The cut was shallow, five or six centimeters below the sternum.	N
618	618	00:35:05	00:35:07	Like the soft spot in a dragon.	N
619	619	00:35:14	00:35:16	Sounds like no honor among thieves.	N
620	620	00:35:16	00:35:19	Well, I'll tell you what they were fighting over.	N
621	621	00:35:19	00:35:20	The jewelry was hot.	N
622	622	00:35:20	00:35:22	Either you fence it fast or eat the loss.	N
623	623	00:35:22	00:35:25	I'm thinking more and more it was never part of the plan.	N
624	624	00:35:25	00:35:26	You know, you could be right.	N
625	625	00:35:26	00:35:28	I talked to the Trents' bank.	Y
626	626	00:35:28	00:35:33	They were on their way to the safety deposit box that morning and then off to Hawaii at the end of the week.	Y
627	627	00:35:33	00:35:36	So it was Laurel Trent who cleaned out her own jewelry box.	Y
628	628	00:35:36	00:35:40	Yeah. Murder was their wage, and jewelry was their tip.	N
629	629	00:35:48	00:35:51	How's your hands?	N
630	630	00:35:51	00:35:53	Sore.	N
631	631	00:35:53	00:35:54	Document every single bill. Fun.	N
632	632	00:35:54	00:35:56	I got to hand it to these casinos.	N
633	633	00:35:56	00:35:58	They got it all figured out.	N
634	634	00:35:58	00:36:01	What do you mean?	N
635	635	00:36:01	00:36:03	Well, this is a $10,000 brick, right?	N
636	636	00:36:03	00:36:04	Mm-hmm.	N
637	637	00:36:04	00:36:10	I could either lose this in a hand of blackjack, or I could lose cranberry chip.	N
638	638	00:36:10	00:36:12	What's worse?	N
639	639	00:36:12	00:36:14	To me, losing's losing.	N
640	640	00:36:17	00:36:19	Sara?	N
641	641	00:36:19	00:36:23	I got a bloodstain.	N
642	642	00:36:23	00:36:28	You know, the last time I checked, defacing government property was a federal offense.	N
643	643	00:36:28	00:36:31	Not when it's logged in as property, Greg.	N
644	644	00:36:31	00:36:33	The blood might be from a paper cut.	N
645	645	00:36:33	00:36:35	Okay, but you're my witness.	N
646	646	00:36:40	00:36:41	Run it against all our players.	N
647	647	00:36:41	00:36:42	Uh-huh.	N
648	648	00:36:42	00:36:45	I finished up on those still photos.	N
649	649	00:36:45	00:36:48	The canteen around little Alex's neck...	N
650	650	00:36:48	00:36:51	is really a set of binoculars.	N
651	651	00:36:53	00:36:57	If you keep flipping, it tells the rest of the story.	N
652	652	00:37:02	00:37:09	Now, call me crazy, but it looks like Daddy doesn't like the little man wearing the binoculars around his neck so much.	Y
653	653	00:37:09	00:37:12	I wonder why?	N
654	654	00:37:40	00:37:42	What are you thinking?	Y
655	655	00:37:42	00:37:45	Stay right here until I call you.	Y
656	656	00:38:00	00:38:01	Yeah?	N
657	657	00:38:01	00:38:05	Nick, would you move about halfway up the driveway?	Y
658	658	00:38:05	00:38:07	Back where Mike Trent was shot?	N
659	659	00:38:07	00:38:09	Exactly.	N
660	660	00:38:13	00:38:15	How's this? Can you see me here?	Y
661	661	00:38:16	00:38:18	No, I can't.	Y
662	662	00:38:18	00:38:19	Thank you.	N
663	663	00:39:05	00:39:08	Jim? Gil.	Y
664	664	00:39:08	00:39:10	I'm fine. How are you?	N
665	665	00:39:10	00:39:13	Would you put an APB out on Kyle Goode's vehicle, please?	N
666	666	00:39:17	00:39:19	You recognize this?	Y
667	667	00:39:19	00:39:21	That's my kid.	N
668	668	00:39:21	00:39:24	What's that around his neck?	Y
669	669	00:39:24	00:39:25	That's his binoculars.	Y
670	670	00:39:25	00:39:29	Yeah. Zeiss, 20x60, BSGA.	N
671	671	00:39:29	00:39:32	4,500 a pop.	Y
672	672	00:39:32	00:39:33	You know how it is.	N
673	673	00:39:33	00:39:36	You got your kid in the car, traveling a long distance.	Y
674	674	00:39:36	00:39:37	Whatever keeps them occupied.	N
675	675	00:39:37	00:39:39	According to your son, he slept all the way to Laughlin.	Y
676	676	00:39:39	00:39:42	Kid falling asleep in a car on the way to his Grandma's house?	N
677	677	00:39:42	00:39:45	You guys won't even make it through the courthouse door.	Y
678	678	00:39:45	00:39:46	Court.	N
679	679	00:39:46	00:39:48	That's where the lawyers get fat.	Y
680	680	00:39:48	00:39:50	And you know all about that.	Y
681	681	00:39:51	00:39:55	I mean, you've got a lawsuit with your ex-business partner, and your ex-wife, who's suing you for past alimony...	Y
682	682	00:39:55	00:39:57	That's irrelevant.	Y
683	683	00:39:57	00:39:58	Not according to his wife it isn't.	Y
684	684	00:39:58	00:40:01	She gave us permission for a hair sample from your son.	Y
685	685	00:40:01	00:40:02	For what?	Y
686	686	00:40:02	00:40:06	The good thing about drugs-- they work their way through the bloodstream in the urine, but not the hair.	Y
687	687	00:40:06	00:40:13	Our lab found trace elements of Ambien, which is a hypnotic sleep sedative, in your son's hair root.	Y
688	688	00:40:13	00:40:16	Until we see the test results, we're withholding comment.	Y
689	689	00:40:16	00:40:19	No problem, counselor. Okay, moving on.	Y
690	690	00:40:19	00:40:23	The buy money, the 20K that we found on the two geniuses you hired?	Y
691	691	00:40:23	00:40:29	What geniuses? You know, the brothers, who are so cool and laid back, they're in the morgue.	Y
692	692	00:40:29	00:40:31	Oh, what? You didn't know they're dead?	Y
693	693	00:40:31	00:40:32	Yeah, they greased each other over the jewelry.	Y
694	694	00:40:32	00:40:35	And that wasn't even part of the deal in the first place, was it?	N
695	695	00:40:40	00:40:43	Good help is hard to find, huh, Kyle?	Y
696	696	00:40:43	00:40:44	He's not answering that.	Y
697	697	00:40:44	00:40:47	I hated that son of a bitch.	Y
698	698	00:40:47	00:40:51	Mike Trent was a scumbag, worst of the worst.	Y
699	699	00:40:51	00:40:53	Use you up and blow right through you.	Y
700	700	00:40:53	00:40:55	I brought him in on my nickel.	Y
701	701	00:40:55	00:40:57	And he throws me out?	Y
702	702	00:40:57	00:41:00	Invests our money in clubs and kicks me out? To do what?	Y
703	703	00:41:00	00:41:02	To ride off into the sunset with my piece of sushi?	Y
704	704	00:41:02	00:41:04	And it's not just me.	N
705	705	00:41:04	00:41:08	There's a lot guys out there got burned by him who wouldn't mind a little revenge.	N
706	706	00:41:08	00:41:13	I'll even go so far as to say I'm not sorry he's dead, or rotting somewhere in some box.	N
707	707	00:41:20	00:41:22	I didn't kill him.	N
708	708	00:41:22	00:41:24	I'm not saying you did.	N
709	709	00:41:24	00:41:26	Or his wife.	N
710	710	00:41:26	00:41:29	But your $20,000 incentive pulled the trigger.	N
711	711	00:41:29	00:41:33	And you know what-- you won't believe this-- a paper cut gave you away.	N
712	712	00:41:33	00:41:35	...ten makes 20 large.	N
713	713	00:41:37	00:41:40	When you do it, I want to see it.	N
714	714	00:41:40	00:41:41	I'll be up here.	N
715	715	00:41:41	00:41:45	We did the DNA test for the cigarette butt you left at the arcade.	N
716	716	00:41:45	00:41:47	Plain view, right counselor?	N
717	717	00:41:47	00:41:49	And we matched it to the blood we found on the money.	N
718	718	00:41:49	00:41:51	He didn't hire two killers. He only hired me.	N
719	719	00:41:51	00:41:53	Yeah, well, lawsuits take a while.	N
720	720	00:41:53	00:41:56	I don't think you cared about a verdict anyway, did you, Kyle?	N
721	721	00:41:56	00:41:59	You wanted much more than that.	N
722	722	00:42:09	00:42:12	God...	N
723	723	00:42:17	00:42:19	No!	N
724	724	00:42:22	00:42:26	My client was with his son all day that day.	N
725	725	00:42:27	00:42:28	Yeah, that's where he screwed up.	N
726	726	00:42:28	00:42:32	Your hatred of Trent was stronger than your love for your own child.	N
727	727	00:42:32	00:42:38	You drugged your son so you could use him as an alibi.	N
728	728	00:42:38	00:42:42	And that's all a jury's going to need to hear to convict you.	N
729	729	00:42:42	00:42:44	Kyle Goode, you've been bad.	N
730	730	00:42:44	00:42:47	You're under arrest.	N
731	731	00:42:57	00:42:58	Oh... you're still here.	N
732	732	00:42:58	00:43:02	Uh... ( clears throat ) so I'm leaving.	N
733	733	00:43:02	00:43:03	Need anything?	N
734	734	00:43:03	00:43:05	No, I'm good.	N
735	735	00:43:06	00:43:07	Are we good?	N
736	736	00:43:10	00:43:12	We'll be fine.	N
737	737	00:43:12	00:43:14	Okay.	N
738	738	00:43:14	00:43:15	I'll see you tomorrow.	N
739	739	00:43:15	00:43:17	Going out?	N
740	740	00:43:19	00:43:23	I've got some unfinished business to take care of.	N
741	741	00:43:23	00:43:26	I'll see you.	N
