0	00:00:52	00:00:56	No! No!
1	00:01:03	00:01:05	Call said one dead body.
2	00:01:05	00:01:06	Caught him red-handed.
3	00:01:06	00:01:08	Ben Jennings.
4	00:01:12	00:01:14	Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
5	00:01:14	00:01:16	You want to tell us what's going on?
6	00:01:16	00:01:18	What happened here?
7	00:01:20	00:01:22	You have anything to say?
8	00:01:24	00:01:27	You don't have to talk to us.
9	00:01:28	00:01:30	He'll talk to us.
10	00:02:07	00:02:09	See that lividity?
11	00:02:09	00:02:12	Blood settled at the time of death.
12	00:02:12	00:02:15	Body's been moved from the murder scene.
13	00:02:15	00:02:16	Impound his car.
14	00:02:16	00:02:19	Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork.
15	00:02:19	00:02:21	My bad, Sara.
16	00:02:21	00:02:26	Let's process this guy shall we?
17	00:02:26	00:02:29	Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!
18	00:02:37	00:02:39	Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner.
19	00:02:41	00:02:42	Arms out, away from your body.
20	00:02:42	00:02:45	That's it. Stay just like that.
21	00:02:52	00:02:53	Give me your right foot.
22	00:02:53	00:02:55	Other right.
23	00:02:56	00:02:56	Put it down.
24	00:02:57	00:02:58	Lift it up.
25	00:02:59	00:03:01	Hold still.
26	00:03:03	00:03:07	Possible secondary transfer.
27	00:03:09	00:03:11	Got some red fibers.
28	00:03:14	00:03:15	Other foot.
29	00:03:15	00:03:16	Lift it up.
30	00:03:16	00:03:17	Put it down.
31	00:03:22	00:03:23	No defensive wounds.
32	00:03:23	00:03:26	No hematomas.
33	00:03:26	00:03:28	Victim didn't fight back.
34	00:03:28	00:03:29	Probably didn't see it coming.
35	00:03:32	00:03:33	Matthew...
36	00:03:34	00:03:36	tag that body for special processing, VIP room.
37	00:03:36	00:03:40	Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails.
38	00:03:50	00:03:54	D.B., Mediterranean Casino, Women's Spa.
39	00:03:56	00:03:58	Body is Shelley Danvers.
40	00:03:58	00:04:01	10/10/81.
41	00:04:01	00:04:03	Employee walked in to get towels...
42	00:04:06	00:04:08	found her here.
43	00:04:15	00:04:21	A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFOs?
44	00:04:23	00:04:24	Done fell out.
45	00:04:24	00:04:26	That's what the night manager says.
46	00:04:29	00:04:30	Miss?
47	00:04:34	00:04:36	We're from the Crime Lab.
48	00:04:36	00:04:39	You found the deceased?
49	00:04:39	00:04:42	Yes, I was, um...
50	00:04:42	00:04:45	just getting some towels and I walked in and she was there.
51	00:04:45	00:04:47	Hey, Brass...
52	00:04:47	00:04:48	you touch this body?
53	00:04:48	00:04:50	Yeah, I was born yesterday.
54	00:04:50	00:04:55	Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.
55	00:04:55	00:04:57	Miss...
56	00:04:57	00:05:00	you know anything about redressing the body?
57	00:05:00	00:05:01	Well, she was naked.
58	00:05:01	00:05:03	I-I-I thought she should be covered.
59	00:05:03	00:05:06	Did you move the body here, too?
60	00:05:06	00:05:08	Guests were looking in.
61	00:05:08	00:05:09	I put a robe on her.
62	00:05:09	00:05:12	It's not like it's a crime or anything.
63	00:05:12	00:05:14	Actually, it is.
64	00:05:14	00:05:17	Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.
65	00:05:22	00:05:23	Flour, maybe?
66	00:05:23	00:05:25	But what kind?
67	00:05:25	00:05:27	All-purpose?
68	00:05:27	00:05:29	Self-rising?
69	00:05:29	00:05:30	Pastry?
70	00:05:30	00:05:33	Trace will probably have a better idea.
71	00:05:35	00:05:39	I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.
72	00:05:39	00:05:40	What about the neck?
73	00:05:40	00:05:42	Any fibers in the wound?
74	00:05:42	00:05:43	You told me to wait for you.
75	00:05:43	00:05:45	Well, that hasn't stopped you yet.
76	00:05:45	00:05:47	I did observe some fibers in the wound.
77	00:05:47	00:05:49	I didn't collect them, though.
78	00:05:49	00:05:51	Be my guest.
79	00:05:56	00:05:58	Yellow.
80	00:05:58	00:06:01	Not cotton; satin, maybe.
81	00:06:06	00:06:08	Dress shirt...
82	00:06:08	00:06:09	but no tie.
83	00:06:10	00:06:12	Strangled with his own tie?
84	00:06:14	00:06:16	Find me on the flour.
85	00:06:18	00:06:21	Shelley Danvers-- 00.
86	00:06:21	00:06:26	Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the Jacuzzi facilities this evening?
87	00:06:26	00:06:27	Not that I remember, no.
88	00:06:29	00:06:30	What? You don't believe me?
89	00:06:31	00:06:33	Well, you lied to us before.
90	00:06:33	00:06:36	It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a Jacuzzi.
91	00:06:36	00:06:38	Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under.
92	00:06:39	00:06:40	The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.
93	00:06:40	00:06:42	Well, that didn't happen here.
94	00:06:42	00:06:44	She did not drown on these premises.
95	00:06:44	00:06:50	Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.
96	00:06:50	00:06:54	Oliver Dunne; corporate lawyer, father of two.
97	00:06:54	00:06:57	You get all that from his dentals?
98	00:06:57	00:06:58	His wife-- widow.
99	00:06:58	00:07:00	She came down to I.D. his property.
100	00:07:00	00:07:01	.380s?
101	00:07:01	00:07:08	Last one I recovered entered through his abdominals pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique.
102	00:07:08	00:07:11	That's not what killed him, is it?
103	00:07:11	00:07:13	We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound.
104	00:07:14	00:07:15	I think it's from his tie.
105	00:07:15	00:07:17	You might be right.
106	00:07:17	00:07:19	He died of asphyxiation.
107	00:07:19	00:07:22	Tie probably closed the windpipe.
108	00:07:22	00:07:26	Without oxygen, the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up.
109	00:07:26	00:07:29	Whole pulmonary system shut down.
110	00:07:29	00:07:34	What you may have here is the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.
111	00:07:34	00:07:39	Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?
112	00:07:39	00:07:43	I cannot tell you why but I might be able to tell you where.
113	00:07:43	00:07:44	A pizza shop.
114	00:07:44	00:07:50	The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content-- seven percent protein-- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing.
115	00:07:51	00:07:53	So, why did you rule out bakeries?
116	00:07:53	00:07:55	Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype; double zero.
117	00:07:55	00:07:58	It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens.
118	00:07:58	00:08:01	Oh, and Trace picked up some oregano in the sample.
119	00:08:01	00:08:04	When are you set to interview Ben?
120	00:08:04	00:08:07	You're the registered owner of a Lorcin .380.
121	00:08:07	00:08:10	Takes the same caliber bullet as the slugs we took out of the victim.
122	00:08:11	00:08:15	So, I'm going to ask you one more time where's your gun?
123	00:08:15	00:08:16	I lost it.
124	00:08:16	00:08:18	Do you think we believe that?
125	00:08:18	00:08:19	Do you think...
126	00:08:19	00:08:20	Are you employed, Ben?
127	00:08:20	00:08:22	Yeah... yeah, um...
128	00:08:22	00:08:27	it's a place called Dante's Pizzeria.
129	00:08:27	00:08:28	It's behind the Strato'.
130	00:08:28	00:08:30	You make pizzas?
131	00:08:30	00:08:32	Well, I deliver the pizzas.
132	00:08:32	00:08:35	It's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff.
133	00:08:36	00:08:38	Do you, uh...
134	00:08:38	00:08:42	ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?
135	00:08:42	00:08:46	Mostly pizza boxes.
136	00:08:46	00:08:48	Why?
137	00:08:48	00:08:55	Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza.
138	00:08:55	00:08:57	Can you explain that?
139	00:08:57	00:08:59	No.
140	00:08:59	00:09:06	Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?
141	00:09:06	00:09:08	Well, I don't have to talk.
142	00:09:08	00:09:13	No... but we're going to figure it out.
143	00:09:13	00:09:16	Look, if you know so much about these murders what do you need me for?
144	00:09:16	00:09:18	Murders?
145	00:09:20	00:09:22	There are more bodies?
146	00:09:29	00:09:31	I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.
147	00:09:31	00:09:33	What is that? A beer can?
148	00:09:33	00:09:35	Soda can?
149	00:09:35	00:09:37	Zilch.
150	00:09:39	00:09:41	Zilch.
151	00:09:41	00:09:43	Don't tell me, more zilch?
152	00:09:43	00:09:45	Whoa... Whoa.
153	00:09:45	00:09:48	Point of disturbance.
154	00:09:48	00:09:49	Hold up.
155	00:09:52	00:09:54	Isolate it.
156	00:10:18	00:10:21	Any more bodies you want to tell me about?
157	00:10:23	00:10:26	No.
158	00:10:26	00:10:29	We're going to radar this whole hillside.
159	00:10:33	00:10:50	Sometimes... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body I sit in my car and it hits me-- how close I was...
160	00:10:50	00:10:55	how heavy the body is...
161	00:10:55	00:10:58	the texture of the body...
162	00:10:58	00:11:01	how it feels... you know?
163	00:11:09	00:11:11	Mr. Grissom...
164	00:11:14	00:11:17	I'm not a bad person.
165	00:11:17	00:11:19	You're not a bad person?
166	00:11:21	00:11:22	Then, what are you?
167	00:11:32	00:11:36	Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.
168	00:11:36	00:11:37	Yep, she's next.
169	00:11:37	00:11:38	Well, it's about time.
170	00:11:38	00:11:40	You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?
171	00:11:40	00:11:43	I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.
172	00:11:43	00:11:46	Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.
173	00:11:46	00:11:48	I'll take it from here, David.
174	00:11:48	00:11:50	Good morning.
175	00:11:50	00:11:52	Catherine.
176	00:11:52	00:11:56	No serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose.
177	00:11:56	00:11:57	She didn't drown?
178	00:11:57	00:12:00	Rules out your Jacuzzi theory.
179	00:12:00	00:12:02	Anything probative?
180	00:12:02	00:12:05	Bright red lividity extending down the body.
181	00:12:05	00:12:06	From?
182	00:12:06	00:12:08	Well, heatstroke possibly.
183	00:12:08	00:12:12	Stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if I'm right...
184	00:12:12	00:12:14	Cover-up.
185	00:12:14	00:12:17	Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine?
186	00:12:17	00:12:21	Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa-- a warrant, if we need it.
187	00:12:22	00:12:23	Yep, that's right.
188	00:12:23	00:12:25	Bye.
189	00:12:25	00:12:26	Oh, it's on.
190	00:12:26	00:12:29	Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?
191	00:12:29	00:12:31	Uh, yeah.
192	00:12:31	00:12:33	Tina... Tina Kolas.
193	00:12:33	00:12:35	Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana.
194	00:12:35	00:12:36	Flew here in a package. Why?
195	00:12:36	00:12:39	We need someone to give us the truth about last night.
196	00:12:49	00:12:51	Gil Grissom?
197	00:12:51	00:12:53	Father?
198	00:12:53	00:12:55	Benjamin's a member of my parish.
199	00:12:55	00:12:56	The officer won't let me talk to him.
200	00:12:56	00:12:58	He said you were in charge.
201	00:12:58	00:13:00	Of this crime scene.
202	00:13:00	00:13:02	He needs spiritual guidance.
203	00:13:08	00:13:10	Yeah, I imagine he does.
204	00:13:10	00:13:14	Ah... then you'd have no problem with my talking to him.
205	00:13:14	00:13:15	It's the 11th hour.
206	00:13:15	00:13:17	I wouldn't expect anything less. 11th hour?
207	00:13:17	00:13:21	When the reality of their actions set in they usually turn to religion.
208	00:13:21	00:13:23	Can you think of a better time?
209	00:13:31	00:13:33	Okay, hold it.
210	00:13:33	00:13:34	That's enough.
211	00:13:34	00:13:35	Let's dust him.
212	00:13:52	00:13:54	No ligature marks.
213	00:13:54	00:13:56	Different from the first guy.
214	00:13:56	00:14:01	See if this laceration on this guy's forehead is consistent with the kid's shovel.
215	00:14:03	00:14:05	Hey...
216	00:14:05	00:14:06	I feel a wallet here.
217	00:14:12	00:14:15	Ramirez Kenny.
218	00:14:15	00:14:18	A 25-year-old Latino and a 42-year-old white guy?
219	00:14:18	00:14:20	Strangers.
220	00:14:20	00:14:22	Doesn't make sense. There's no connection.
221	00:14:22	00:14:25	Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery.
222	00:14:25	00:14:27	Hey, O'Riley.
223	00:14:27	00:14:29	What's the matter, man-- A.C. not working?
224	00:14:29	00:14:30	I was on with Dispatch.
225	00:14:30	00:14:36	Oliver Dunne's car was just found by the Highway Patrol abandoned at an AvCon station off 215.
226	00:14:36	00:14:41	They didn't happen to find another car there, did they?
227	00:14:41	00:14:43	Yeah.
228	00:14:43	00:14:46	Registered to a Ramirez.
229	00:14:46	00:14:49	Yeah... gas station.
230	00:14:58	00:15:05	And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night she was going to use the dry sauna?
231	00:15:05	00:15:07	We'd been drinking apple martinis for three days straight.
232	00:15:07	00:15:10	Shelley said the sauna would detox her you know, clean her out.
233	00:15:14	00:15:15	Cath.
234	00:15:17	00:15:18	Whose shirt is this?
235	00:15:18	00:15:21	Mine. Shelley and I got in a fight over it.
236	00:15:21	00:15:22	When?
237	00:15:22	00:15:23	Yesterday.
238	00:15:23	00:15:31	I caught her trying it on and I said Give it back, and then we started fighting over it, you know, tug of war and the whole thing ripped right in two.
239	00:15:31	00:15:32	We fell back laughing.
240	00:15:35	00:15:37	I'd give anything to have her back.
241	00:15:37	00:15:41	We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind.
242	00:15:41	00:15:43	No, go ahead, if it'll help.
243	00:15:43	00:15:46	You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.
244	00:15:46	00:15:48	She called down from this phone.
245	00:15:48	00:15:50	Do they tape phone calls here?
246	00:15:50	00:15:52	Hotel surveillance would love that.
247	00:15:52	00:15:55	You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?
248	00:15:55	00:15:56	Yeah.
249	00:16:00	00:16:02	We're going to take this as well.
250	00:16:02	00:16:05	Okay... but it doesn't have anything on it.
251	00:16:05	00:16:07	Well, that's okay.
252	00:16:07	00:16:08	We do magic.
253	00:16:10	00:16:13	Two men were shot and killed and you didn't see anything?
254	00:16:13	00:16:14	Sorry.
255	00:16:14	00:16:17	You don't just miss something like that. What was going on?
256	00:16:17	00:16:19	A friend of mine came with his new car.
257	00:16:19	00:16:21	We took it for a drive.
258	00:16:21	00:16:22	I'm afraid my boss will find out.
259	00:16:22	00:16:23	I was only gone five minutes.
260	00:16:24	00:16:25	Okay, all right.
261	00:16:25	00:16:26	Just walk us through it.
262	00:16:26	00:16:28	When did you know there'd been a crime committed?
263	00:16:29	00:16:33	Well, my buddy dropped me back here and I noticed these two cars.
264	00:16:33	00:16:35	I went to check them out.
265	00:16:43	00:16:45	Oh, my God.
266	00:16:49	00:16:50	I don't see any blood.
267	00:16:50	00:16:51	Yeah, I hosed it down.
268	00:16:51	00:16:52	You what?
269	00:16:52	00:16:53	It was freakin' me out.
270	00:17:04	00:17:06	H-Hello?
271	00:17:06	00:17:07	Mr. Grissom?
272	00:17:07	00:17:09	Uh...
273	00:17:11	00:17:14	They told me out front I'd find you here.
274	00:17:18	00:17:20	I don't see your, uh... visitor's badge.
275	00:17:21	00:17:22	Priest's collar.
276	00:17:22	00:17:24	People trust it.
277	00:17:25	00:17:27	Most people.
278	00:17:27	00:17:29	Even lapsed Catholics.
279	00:17:29	00:17:34	What makes you think, uh... I was ever a Catholic?
280	00:17:34	00:17:36	First time we met, you called me Father.
281	00:17:36	00:17:37	Only Romans do that.
282	00:17:38	00:17:41	Everybody else, it's Reverend or Minister.
283	00:17:41	00:17:45	I wanted to know how your investigation against Ben is going.
284	00:17:45	00:17:46	This is his car.
285	00:17:47	00:17:49	You know, you really shouldn't be here.
286	00:17:49	00:17:52	I didn't come here to tamper with your evidence.
287	00:18:03	00:18:06	He was a good kid, all through school.
288	00:18:06	00:18:11	Still comes to Mass every Sunday.
289	00:18:11	00:18:14	If he has a problem...
290	00:18:14	00:18:15	it's trying to please people.
291	00:18:17	00:18:19	Is that a problem?
292	00:18:19	00:18:20	It can be.
293	00:18:31	00:18:34	This Luminol reveals any dried blood spots.
294	00:18:56	00:18:58	He wouldn't do this.
295	00:18:59	00:19:01	I believe the car.
296	00:19:04	00:19:09	To whom much is given, much will be expected.
297	00:19:12	00:19:15	I leave you to your work.
298	00:19:22	00:19:26	I told you we have no record Shelley Danvers specifically used the dry sauna.
299	00:19:26	00:19:28	That's okay, 'cause we do.
300	00:19:28	00:19:33	ESDA can read this blank paper see what's written on it.
301	00:19:33	00:19:34	Up to 14 layers.
302	00:19:34	00:19:37	Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.
303	00:19:39	00:19:41	That's Miss Danvers' handwriting.
304	00:19:41	00:19:42	We confirm that.
305	00:19:42	00:19:43	So she took a dry sauna.
306	00:19:43	00:19:44	What does that prove?
307	00:19:44	00:19:48	She died of a heat stroke.
308	00:19:48	00:19:52	The Coroner just called in with the results of his final post.
309	00:19:52	00:19:56	Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke-- 182 °F.
310	00:19:58	00:20:01	That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.
311	00:20:01	00:20:03	Especially if no one checks up on them.
312	00:20:03	00:20:07	A hotel employee is supposed to check on the various saunas every 15 minutes.
313	00:20:07	00:20:09	Hotel regulations, right?
314	00:20:10	00:20:16	We, uh, we got a copy of the check-up sheet.
315	00:20:17	00:20:23	30 p.m.
316	00:20:23	00:20:25	00 until...
317	00:20:25	00:20:27	what time did you call 9-1-1?
318	00:20:31	00:20:32	I, um...
319	00:20:32	00:20:33	I came in at closing.
320	00:20:33	00:20:34	00.
321	00:20:34	00:20:37	Miss?
322	00:20:37	00:20:38	Miss?
323	00:20:38	00:20:39	Oh, my God.
324	00:20:39	00:20:41	You moved her into the locker room?
325	00:20:42	00:20:43	Put the robe on her?
326	00:20:43	00:20:46	I was just trying to protect the hotel.
327	00:20:46	00:20:48	From negligent homicide.
328	00:20:48	00:20:53	They drill into us that the reputation of this hotel is everything.
329	00:20:53	00:20:55	Murder scene was compromised.
330	00:20:55	00:21:02	Pump jockey wasn't very helpful but bullets pulled from Victim One and Victim Two.
331	00:21:02	00:21:03	Identical striations.
332	00:21:03	00:21:06	Bullets in both victims were fired by the exact same weapon.
333	00:21:06	00:21:07	A Lorcin .380.
334	00:21:07	00:21:11	The same pistol registered to a Benjamin Jennings.
335	00:21:11	00:21:16	P.D. can prove through credit cards that Ben frequents the AvCon gas stations where both vics were killed.
336	00:21:16	00:21:20	And we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found.
337	00:21:20	00:21:21	And fibers.
338	00:21:23	00:21:27	I recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of Victim One.
339	00:21:27	00:21:29	Found the same fiber on the sock of Victim Two.
340	00:21:29	00:21:33	We ID'd the fibers using the FTIR.
341	00:21:33	00:21:35	It's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting.
342	00:21:35	00:21:37	So we went back to Ben's car.
343	00:21:40	00:21:42	They're identical.
344	00:21:42	00:21:44	We got the Master Standards from the car manufacturer.
345	00:21:44	00:21:48	The assigned name for the material is 12-ounce Merlot Trialon.
346	00:21:50	00:21:53	Bottom line... he killed them.
347	00:21:53	00:21:56	Good work, you guys.
348	00:21:56	00:22:00	Very good.
349	00:22:00	00:22:02	But you haven't proved murder.
350	00:22:02	00:22:03	You've proved burial.
351	00:22:03	00:22:05	Excuse me?
352	00:22:05	00:22:07	Victim blood on his clothes...
353	00:22:08	00:22:09	under his nails.
354	00:22:09	00:22:11	From burying them.
355	00:22:11	00:22:14	Victim blood in his car?
356	00:22:14	00:22:16	He transported them.
357	00:22:17	00:22:20	Show me the gun with Ben's prints on it.
358	00:22:20	00:22:23	Gun shot residue, the ligature, the...
359	00:22:23	00:22:26	The holes in Christ's hands, Doubting Thomas?
360	00:22:26	00:22:28	Yes. Empirical evidence.
361	00:22:28	00:22:31	St. Thomas was ahead of us all.
362	00:22:31	00:22:36	Does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here?
363	00:22:36	00:22:37	No.
364	00:22:37	00:22:40	It has to do with the evidence.
365	00:22:40	00:22:43	It's our job to present the D.A. with the best evidence possible.
366	00:22:43	00:22:44	Let a jury decide.
367	00:22:44	00:22:47	Anything else, we're playing judge.
368	00:22:47	00:22:51	The evidence doesn't get any better than this.
369	00:23:00	00:23:01	Okay. Ship it.
370	00:23:01	00:23:02	Show it to the D.A.
371	00:23:03	00:23:06	Right.
372	00:23:12	00:23:13	Anyone up for breakfast?
373	00:23:13	00:23:16	I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.
374	00:23:16	00:23:19	Football-- wide-screen.
375	00:23:19	00:23:21	Well, I guess I'll go see Tina alone.
376	00:23:22	00:23:25	Hotel tells me she's down playing quarter slots.
377	00:23:27	00:23:29	I thought we solved this case.
378	00:23:29	00:23:30	What'd you get?
379	00:23:30	00:23:37	Well, my guy in the hotel lounge tells me that Tina and Shelley were having a catfight over some dude named Jeremy the day she died.
380	00:23:37	00:23:41	That's probably how the shirt really got ripped.
381	00:23:41	00:23:44	Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.
382	00:23:44	00:23:46	Misunderstood the priest?
383	00:23:46	00:23:48	How?
384	00:23:48	00:23:50	I looked deeper into the evidence.
385	00:23:50	00:23:52	I should have looked deeper into Ben's character.
386	00:23:52	00:23:55	Benjamin Corey Jennings.
387	00:23:55	00:23:56	Nonviolent crimes.
388	00:23:58	00:24:01	Roger Jennings... armed robbery.
389	00:24:01	00:24:07	Past convictions, breaking and entering assault with great bodily harm.
390	00:24:07	00:24:10	Paroled 9/27/2000.
391	00:24:10	00:24:12	This guy is hard-core.
392	00:24:12	00:24:14	He's looking at his third strike here.
393	00:24:17	00:24:19	What's going on?
394	00:24:23	00:24:25	You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?
395	00:24:25	00:24:26	Yeah.
396	00:24:26	00:24:29	We might have been wrong.
397	00:24:29	00:24:31	Tell me about your brother.
398	00:24:36	00:24:38	We know that you only buried the bodies.
399	00:24:38	00:24:41	So, what happened?
400	00:24:43	00:24:45	Did he threaten you?
401	00:24:49	00:24:51	Ben?
402	00:25:11	00:25:13	Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison, Roger?
403	00:25:16	00:25:19	Who the hell are you guys?
404	00:25:19	00:25:21	Get out of my kitchen.
405	00:25:21	00:25:25	Roger Jennings-- armed robbery, breaking and entering.
406	00:25:25	00:25:28	You sound like the kind of guy it wouldn't be a big jump to murder.
407	00:25:29	00:25:30	What is this?
408	00:25:32	00:25:34	Your first stop the AvCon gas station.
409	00:25:34	00:25:35	See these two guys?
410	00:25:35	00:25:37	Nope.
411	00:25:37	00:25:40	Don't know what you're talking about.
412	00:25:40	00:25:42	My little brother got me this job.
413	00:25:42	00:25:43	I'm staying clean.
414	00:25:43	00:25:46	Suppose I told you your brother said you did these guys.
415	00:25:49	00:25:51	He wouldn't do that.
416	00:25:51	00:26:00	You did it directly after work using a .380 pistol and then you strangled one of the victims with his own tie.
417	00:26:12	00:26:14	Ben did it.
418	00:26:15	00:26:16	Did you witness this?
419	00:26:16	00:26:19	He told me about it.
420	00:26:19	00:26:21	Look what I did-- I just lost my head.
421	00:26:22	00:26:23	What am I supposed to do now?
422	00:26:23	00:26:26	I'm on a short line, all right?
423	00:26:26	00:26:27	You're on your own, Ben.
424	00:26:28	00:26:29	Roger, you've got to help me.
425	00:26:29	00:26:30	You know I can't.
426	00:26:30	00:26:31	What am I going to do?
427	00:26:31	00:26:32	Huh?
428	00:26:32	00:26:33	It's your mess.
429	00:26:33	00:26:34	You got to deal with it.
430	00:26:34	00:26:37	What started the beef with the victims?
431	00:26:37	00:26:38	I don't know.
432	00:26:38	00:26:40	Tempers, I guess.
433	00:26:42	00:26:43	Hey!
434	00:26:43	00:26:45	Hey, man! I was here first.
435	00:26:45	00:26:46	You want to wait your turn?
436	00:26:46	00:26:48	What are you going to do, huh?
437	00:26:51	00:26:53	Bystander gets a little too nosy...
438	00:26:57	00:26:59	and he gets it, too.
439	00:27:01	00:27:04	The perpetrator's hands left flour on the victim's face.
440	00:27:04	00:27:06	This was not from a gunshot.
441	00:27:06	00:27:09	This was something a little more intimate.
442	00:27:20	00:27:30	When a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one of two reasons-- entertainment... or necessity.
443	00:27:30	00:27:32	Which was it for you?
444	00:27:32	00:27:33	Neither.
445	00:27:33	00:27:36	I told you, Ben strangled that guy.
446	00:27:36	00:27:38	The flour said you did.
447	00:27:40	00:27:42	I don't know what you're talking about.
448	00:27:43	00:27:46	Anything on the list besides the tie?
449	00:27:46	00:27:48	Nope.
450	00:27:50	00:27:52	Hey, guys.
451	00:27:52	00:27:53	You can go ahead and take off.
452	00:27:53	00:27:54	I think we got it.
453	00:27:54	00:27:55	Thanks.
454	00:28:02	00:28:03	Whoa.
455	00:28:18	00:28:19	Hey.
456	00:28:19	00:28:21	Dry cleaning.
457	00:28:21	00:28:22	The trailer's low-rent.
458	00:28:22	00:28:24	Dry cleaning's expensive.
459	00:28:36	00:28:38	Sara?
460	00:28:38	00:28:40	This man's not as smart as he thinks.
461	00:28:40	00:28:42	Dry cleaning bakes in blood stains.
462	00:28:44	00:28:45	Could be red sauce.
463	00:28:45	00:28:46	Oh, now you're cautious.
464	00:28:46	00:28:49	I'm just trying to put our mistake to good use.
465	00:28:49	00:28:52	Okay. You wanna...
466	00:28:52	00:28:56	check the perimeter and I'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce.
467	00:28:56	00:28:57	Okay.
468	00:30:10	00:30:11	Hemoglobin.
469	00:30:11	00:30:13	Take a look at this.
470	00:30:19	00:30:20	Nick?
471	00:30:22	00:30:24	Hey, Nick.
472	00:31:07	00:31:09	jammed, huh?
473	00:31:09	00:31:11	Get anything instructive?
474	00:31:11	00:31:12	Possibly.
475	00:31:13	00:31:14	Blood from Jennings's denim shirt.
476	00:31:19	00:31:20	Is the printer out of ink?
477	00:31:20	00:31:22	ND, ND, ND.
478	00:31:22	00:31:23	It means None Detected.
479	00:31:23	00:31:28	The dry cleaning baked in the blood and it also degraded it to a degree that I can't get a result.
480	00:31:28	00:31:31	Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.
481	00:31:31	00:31:32	I have tried.
482	00:31:32	00:31:33	It's chemically impossible, Sara.
483	00:31:33	00:31:35	Nothing from nothing is nothing.
484	00:31:42	00:31:45	The striations are different. See?
485	00:31:47	00:31:52	There's no way I can say that the bullets taken from the victims were fired by Jennings's gun.
486	00:31:54	00:31:56	So, he altered the barrel somehow.
487	00:31:56	00:32:03	Yeah. Changed how the bullet relates to the barrel so when the bullet emerges, its fine stria are altered.
488	00:32:03	00:32:05	Any idea what he used?
489	00:32:07	00:32:09	Whatever it was...
490	00:32:09	00:32:10	did the job.
491	00:32:10	00:32:11	My evidence is no better.
492	00:32:11	00:32:13	Total wash.
493	00:32:16	00:32:18	We present this to the D.A.
494	00:32:18	00:32:22	Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before.
495	00:32:22	00:32:23	The guilty brother's going to walk.
496	00:32:56	00:32:59	He's never been in any real trouble before.
497	00:33:00	00:33:01	They'll go easy on him.
498	00:33:06	00:33:08	The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?
499	00:33:18	00:33:21	So, it was necessity.
500	00:33:33	00:33:36	Wait, are you saying Shelley didn't die in the sauna?
501	00:33:36	00:33:37	She died of heat stroke.
502	00:33:37	00:33:41	But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.
503	00:33:41	00:33:42	Like what?
504	00:33:42	00:33:43	Shell was always healthy.
505	00:33:44	00:33:45	She went into anaphylactic shock.
506	00:33:45	00:33:52	Coroner says some of the indicators renal failure, cerebral edema.
507	00:33:52	00:33:57	We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.
508	00:33:57	00:33:59	I don't understand.
509	00:33:59	00:34:03	Well, maybe this will help-- the travel agency contract you and Shelley signed.
510	00:34:03	00:34:07	Under allergic reactions to foods for Shelley Danvers-- shellfish.
511	00:34:07	00:34:09	As her best friend, you would know that.
512	00:34:09	00:34:24	And then we have this from the hotel computer for your room 01 p.m., on the day A Taste from the Sea a lovely tureen of mild bisque with pureed bits of Maine lobster.
513	00:34:24	00:34:27	Pureed, two bowls.
514	00:34:27	00:34:31	She didn't know what she was eating when it arrived, did she?
515	00:34:33	00:34:36	Because she didn't order it; you did.
516	00:34:39	00:34:46	We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints.
517	00:34:46	00:34:48	Well, the machine isolated this.
518	00:34:49	00:34:51	00.
519	00:34:51	00:34:53	Shelley made that date.
520	00:34:53	00:34:54	That's her handwriting.
521	00:34:55	00:34:58	Were you in the room when Jeremy called?
522	00:34:58	00:35:00	I answered the phone.
523	00:35:00	00:35:02	He asked for her.
524	00:35:02	00:35:05	You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?
525	00:35:05	00:35:07	I didn't mean to kill her.
526	00:35:07	00:35:14	I thought that she would just have an allergic reaction and she wouldn't be able to make her date that night like, get hives or something.
527	00:35:14	00:35:25	Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions-- trachea... larynx... tongue swelled.
528	00:35:25	00:35:30	Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs.
529	00:35:30	00:35:32	They shut down.
530	00:35:37	00:35:39	I didn't even like the guy.
531	00:35:39	00:35:44	I just... I didn't want to be left out.
532	00:35:48	00:35:52	Miss Kolas, you're under arrest.
533	00:35:52	00:35:55	Hey.
534	00:35:55	00:35:56	D.A.'s looking for you.
535	00:35:56	00:35:59	About? What, you think I read your messages?
536	00:36:00	00:36:03	Top secret and urgent?
537	00:36:03	00:36:04	It's a gift, reading upside down.
538	00:36:04	00:36:06	The Las Vegas District Attorney is reportedly...
539	00:36:06	00:36:08	preparing to file homicide charges...
540	00:36:08	00:36:13	against Benjamin Corey Jennings in the so-called Burial Murders case.
541	00:36:13	00:36:16	Jennings has been in police custody for the last...
542	00:36:16	00:36:18	Guess we know what she was calling about.
543	00:36:18	00:36:23	...since he was caught burying the first victim, Oliver Dunne in the National Forest.
544	00:36:23	00:36:28	Don't you have enough cases over at CSI now you're going to start telling me which ones I should take to court?
545	00:36:28	00:36:32	There isn't one piece of evidence that says that kid was even present at the murders.
546	00:36:32	00:36:34	As a matter of fact this is why I was hunting you.
547	00:36:34	00:36:37	Jennings brought it in about an hour ago.
548	00:36:37	00:36:39	Chain of custody; I can't touch it.
549	00:36:40	00:36:42	The first victim was ligatured, right?
550	00:36:51	00:36:54	Jennings says his little brother asked him to hide the tie.
551	00:36:54	00:36:55	Well, how convenient.
552	00:36:55	00:37:01	The older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over the murder weapon.
553	00:37:01	00:37:04	A jury doesn't understand epi-whatevers, okay?
554	00:37:04	00:37:09	They understand a twisty tie and blood all over Ben's car seat.
555	00:37:09	00:37:10	He set up his brother.
556	00:37:10	00:37:14	Oh, come on, Grissom, they're both part of it and if I can get one of them, I will.
557	00:37:14	00:37:15	He's a good kid, Robin.
558	00:37:15	00:37:18	He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid.
559	00:37:18	00:37:19	Yeah?
560	00:37:19	00:37:22	Then his epithelials shouldn't be on that tie.
561	00:37:24	00:37:31	Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim.
562	00:37:31	00:37:32	I don't know.
563	00:37:32	00:37:36	Your brother brought this in to the District Attorney.
564	00:37:40	00:37:42	What?
565	00:37:42	00:37:43	He's framing you.
566	00:37:43	00:37:49	Unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie.
567	00:37:49	00:37:52	I don't know.
568	00:37:52	00:37:54	I swear I don't know.
569	00:37:54	00:37:57	I... he... I just picked up the bodies at his place.
570	00:37:59	00:38:00	Grab that guy's tie, little bro.
571	00:38:00	00:38:02	I like that thing.
572	00:38:08	00:38:10	Bury them deep, all right?
573	00:38:10	00:38:14	You get into any trouble you don't have to say anything, all right?
574	00:38:14	00:38:15	I'm counting on you.
575	00:38:15	00:38:18	Yeah, yeah, man, I'm there all the way.
576	00:38:18	00:38:21	Go, get out of here.
577	00:38:21	00:38:23	Go on.
578	00:38:24	00:38:26	I got to ask...
579	00:38:26	00:38:30	how does somebody bury two bodies as a favor?
580	00:38:30	00:38:32	'Cause he's my brother.
581	00:38:33	00:38:37	He told... He told me that if I didn't talk...
582	00:38:37	00:38:41	to you guys and if he didn't talk, then this would all just blow over; it'd all just go away.
583	00:38:41	00:38:45	You're looking at two counts of Murder Special Circumstances.
584	00:38:45	00:38:50	The best you can hope for is life without parole.
585	00:38:50	00:38:53	I don't... I don't think I can do that kind of time.
586	00:38:55	00:39:00	Do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders?
587	00:39:00	00:39:01	Anything?
588	00:39:57	00:40:00	I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.
589	00:40:07	00:40:09	He came to see you as soon as Ben was in custody.
590	00:40:12	00:40:16	I tried to help without breaking my vows.
591	00:40:20	00:40:24	We both have jobs that begin after the crime.
592	00:40:24	00:40:27	After the sin.
593	00:40:27	00:40:31	Some people would call that a career in futility.
594	00:40:31	00:40:34	Some call it a vocation.
595	00:40:37	00:40:42	100 years ago we didn't have the technology for fingerprints.
596	00:40:42	00:40:44	15 years ago, we didn't have DNA.
597	00:40:44	00:40:52	Hopefully one day, we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail in this case.
598	00:40:52	00:40:55	Someday, we won't need jails.
599	00:40:58	00:41:02	00.
600	00:41:04	00:41:07	Thank you...
601	00:41:07	00:41:10	but...
602	00:41:10	00:41:12	no.
603	00:41:12	00:41:15	You don't believe?
604	00:41:15	00:41:18	In religion?
605	00:41:18	00:41:21	I believe in God, in science...
606	00:41:21	00:41:23	in Sunday supper.
607	00:41:23	00:41:27	I don't believe in rules that tell me how I should live.
608	00:41:27	00:41:30	Even if they're handed down by God?
609	00:41:30	00:41:32	How many crusades were fought in the name of God?
610	00:41:32	00:41:36	How many people died because of someone's religion?
611	00:41:36	00:41:39	Fanaticism; not religion.
612	00:41:39	00:41:41	Semantics.
613	00:41:41	00:41:43	They're still dead.
614	00:41:44	00:41:47	I'm sorry about Ben, Father.
615	00:41:50	00:41:53	You still suffer like a Catholic.
616	00:41:56	00:42:00	Light bulb goes out other people fix it, get a new one.
617	00:42:00	00:42:08	Light bulb goes out for the Catholic he stands in the dark says, What did I do wrong?
618	00:42:10	00:42:12	That guilt's not in me anymore.
619	00:42:28	00:42:29	Hey.
620	00:42:29	00:42:30	Oh.
621	00:42:31	00:42:35	You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.
622	00:42:35	00:42:38	Spa safety?
623	00:42:38	00:42:42	We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean.
624	00:42:42	00:42:46	Some foul play; some negligence.
625	00:42:46	00:42:48	So what am I supposed to say?
626	00:42:48	00:42:50	That it was an isolated incident...
627	00:42:50	00:42:55	that in no way should it be a mark against the Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.
628	00:42:55	00:42:58	CSI supports Las Vegas.
629	00:42:58	00:42:59	Bottom line.
630	00:43:07	00:43:09	Need some help in here!
631	00:43:15	00:43:16	Hold his head! Hold his head!
632	00:43:16	00:43:18	I can't stop the bleeding.
633	00:43:18	00:43:20	Oh, no, no, no.
634	00:43:20	00:43:21	How did this happen?!
635	00:43:21	00:43:23	Incisor. He used his teeth.
636	00:43:23	00:43:24	Clamp down.
637	00:43:26	00:43:27	Keep him with us.
638	00:43:27	00:43:28	Get out of the way!
639	00:43:28	00:43:30	Out of the way! Sir, step back.
640	00:43:30	00:43:32	Sir. He's bleeding out.
641	00:43:32	00:43:33	He's bleeding out here.
642	00:43:33	00:43:35	We need to stop this.
643	00:43:35	00:43:37	Compression. Keep him with us.
644	00:43:37	00:43:38	Get the head up.
645	00:43:38	00:43:41	We're losing him, we're losing him.
646	00:43:46	00:43:49	04.
