0	00:00:02	00:00:06	You can tell by the neuro-intergalactic vibrations, the invasion's coming.
1	00:00:06	00:00:09	You know they're watching us right now.
2	00:00:09	00:00:13	These other dimensions-- they're everywhere.
3	00:00:13	00:00:29	And string-- it's obvious-- string is the thing that connects everything, protons, photons, fig newtons, electrons, neutrons and time...
4	00:00:29	00:00:31	and space...
5	00:00:31	00:00:33	Time and space?
6	00:00:33	00:00:34	All right. I'm thinking probable cause...
7	00:00:34	00:00:38	I see you, turning your back on me, shaking your head.
8	00:00:38	00:00:40	I can't help you.
9	00:00:40	00:00:43	Ignore the truth at your own peril, sir.
10	00:00:43	00:00:45	At your own peril.
11	00:00:45	00:00:51	Hi, see, we can't see the strings 'cause they're invisible, but they can 'cause they're the 11th dimension.
12	00:00:51	00:00:53	Hey, you're ready for them tonight, Evelyn.
13	00:00:53	00:00:54	The invasion's tonight.
14	00:00:54	00:00:57	Don't say I didn't warn you.
15	00:00:57	00:00:59	What's the matter? Can't look?
16	00:00:59	00:01:00	You know what that tells me?
17	00:01:00	00:01:02	That you did it.
18	00:01:02	00:01:05	You shot her, you put a dress on her.
19	00:01:06	00:01:09	I mean, the trooper saw you put the body in the back of your pickup truck.
20	00:01:09	00:01:11	Anything else you did, we're going to find out.
21	00:01:11	00:01:14	That's what he's doing.
22	00:01:14	00:01:17	And the body is in autopsy right now.
23	00:01:21	00:01:24	Oh, this must be our Jane Doe.
24	00:01:24	00:01:26	Doe, a deer.
25	00:01:26	00:01:27	A female deer.
26	00:01:28	00:01:29	It's not funny.
27	00:01:29	00:01:30	It's a little funny.
28	00:01:30	00:01:32	Doc, I already took photos.
29	00:01:32	00:01:35	Not for my scrapbook, you didn't.
30	00:01:35	00:01:36	This is animal abuse.
31	00:01:36	00:01:37	The killing, sure.
32	00:01:38	00:01:39	The dress?
33	00:01:39	00:01:42	Pet owners put sweaters on chihuahuas.
34	00:01:42	00:01:45	Just give me a hand with the arrow.
35	00:01:53	00:01:57	Hmm, it's not an arrow; it's a bolt shot from a crossbow.
36	00:01:58	00:02:01	(sniffs) Alcohol.
37	00:02:02	00:02:04	You think he had to get her liquored up?
38	00:02:04	00:02:11	Okay, so you got a DUI, resisting arrest, several new and unique wildlife violations.
39	00:02:11	00:02:13	You're in a truckload of trouble, Kyle.
40	00:02:13	00:02:17	I... I... I found her like that.
41	00:02:17	00:02:19	In a cocktail dress?
42	00:02:22	00:02:24	I didn't put no dress on her.
43	00:02:24	00:02:27	Oh, no, no, no... see, I was...
44	00:02:27	00:02:30	I was taking her to the vet.
45	00:02:30	00:02:32	You sure it wasn't a nightclub?
46	00:02:32	00:02:36	Then how do you explain the crossbow I found in your truck there, boss?
47	00:02:36	00:02:38	Easy. Somebody put it there.
48	00:02:38	00:02:41	Okay, take a deep breath for me now.
49	00:02:41	00:02:44	Blow into this.
50	00:02:46	00:02:47	Come on, guys. I mean, can't...
51	00:02:47	00:02:48	can't you give me a break here?
52	00:02:48	00:02:50	I mean, look, no, here...
53	00:02:50	00:02:52	I... I... I just got a...
54	00:02:52	00:02:58	I got a divorce, right, and my ex just cleaned me out.
55	00:02:58	00:02:59	her name is Bambi.
56	00:03:01	00:03:04	Blow! (inhales)
57	00:03:14	00:03:15	Stop him!
58	00:03:31	00:03:33	Move, move, move! Get out of the way!
59	00:03:33	00:03:34	Get out of the way!
60	00:03:43	00:03:44	Hey!
61	00:03:44	00:03:46	Hey, hey, hey, citizens arrest!
62	00:03:51	00:03:52	Light him up.
63	00:04:01	00:04:05	Now do you believe me?
64	00:04:46	00:04:50	Stun guns aren't necessarily nonlethal, just less lethal.
65	00:04:53	00:04:56	AFID tags confirm it was Officer Choi's weapon.
66	00:04:58	00:05:01	You know, I don't get it.
67	00:05:01	00:05:07	Suspect makes a break for it, clocks a couple of unis, gets pepper-sprayed, and keeps going.
68	00:05:07	00:05:09	Pepper spray doesn't always stop them when they're really drunk.
69	00:05:09	00:05:12	Suspect blew a .28.
70	00:05:12	00:05:14	Oh, well, maybe he was a sloppy drunk.
71	00:05:14	00:05:16	Any alcohol on his clothes?
72	00:05:16	00:05:18	He'd been in PD for hours. Alcohol would have evaporated.
73	00:05:19	00:05:20	I'm gonna need your stun gun.
74	00:05:20	00:05:21	Am I in trouble?
75	00:05:21	00:05:23	When was the last time you had this thing serviced?
76	00:05:23	00:05:25	Not since I've been on the force.
77	00:05:25	00:05:27	That's only six months now.
78	00:05:27	00:05:29	We'll have it analyzed, see if it was malfunctioning.
79	00:05:29	00:05:32	That's the first time I had to shoot it.
80	00:05:32	00:05:33	Relax, man.
81	00:05:33	00:05:35	You were following captain's orders.
82	00:05:35	00:05:37	When you talk to IA, just be honest...
83	00:05:37	00:05:38	and don't expect a hug.
84	00:05:38	00:05:42	That's when you said to your officer, I quote, Light him up.
85	00:05:42	00:05:43	Poor choice of words.
86	00:05:43	00:05:46	We followed the proper procedure for escalation of force.
87	00:05:46	00:05:47	I mean, at least we didn't shoot him.
88	00:05:47	00:05:48	Of course, that would have killed him.
89	00:05:48	00:05:52	As far as my office is concerned, we got an in-custody death on your orders.
90	00:05:52	00:05:58	Doesn't get much worse. Look, we use stun guns all the time around here; this is the first one that caught on fire.
91	00:05:58	00:05:59	What do you think?
92	00:05:59	00:06:01	Maybe this guy had so much booze it made him a Roman candle?
93	00:06:01	00:06:04	Well, unfortunately, human blood is 83% water.
94	00:06:04	00:06:07	It's just not flammable, no matter how drunk you are.
95	00:06:07	00:06:11	That's too bad. Might have let you off the hook.
96	00:06:14	00:06:18	Together in death, as they were in life.
97	00:06:18	00:06:21	Guy abuses wildlife and then bursts into flames.
98	00:06:21	00:06:23	I call it karma.
99	00:06:24	00:06:28	There are no physical signs their relationship was anything other than platonic.
100	00:06:28	00:06:33	I mean, we're the ones encroaching on their habitat-- you don't see them shooting us.
101	00:06:34	00:06:37	Consider this justice for Bambi's mother.
102	00:06:55	00:06:56	Light him up.
103	00:07:04	00:07:07	This is the rest of the stuff that we got from the dead guy's truck.
104	00:07:11	00:07:13	One crossbow.
105	00:07:13	00:07:18	Same bolts we recovered from the dead deer.
106	00:07:18	00:07:21	Couple of mason jars.
107	00:07:22	00:07:25	Whew! Moonshine.
108	00:07:25	00:07:26	Home brew.
109	00:07:26	00:07:27	Firewater.
110	00:07:27	00:07:30	Grain alcohol's 190 proof, you know?
111	00:07:30	00:07:31	That's 95% alcohol.
112	00:07:31	00:07:33	Who was he trying to forget?
113	00:07:33	00:07:35	Well, Brass said that he'd just gotten divorced.
114	00:07:35	00:07:37	Welcome to the club.
115	00:07:37	00:07:41	You see any night-vision goggles or, uh, spotlights in that box?
116	00:07:42	00:07:43	No, why?
117	00:07:43	00:07:45	Well...
118	00:07:45	00:07:50	I think he must have shot the deer during the day and then waited until dark to put her in his truck.
119	00:07:50	00:07:54	That's a long time just sitting out in the woods drinking.
120	00:07:54	00:07:55	Stun gun checks out.
121	00:07:55	00:07:56	Operates as designed.
122	00:07:56	00:07:59	Puts out the standard 50,000 volts.
123	00:07:59	00:08:01	Well, that eliminates one variable.
124	00:08:01	00:08:07	Leaves us with the shirt, the grain alcohol, and the pepper spray.
125	00:08:07	00:08:10	Time to find out if one of those made him catch on fire.
126	00:08:12	00:08:14	Don't tase me, bro.
127	00:08:15	00:08:16	Don't tempt me.
128	00:08:56	00:08:59	What are we missing?
129	00:09:01	00:09:06	Either she's a 421-Adam, or somewhere a scarecrow and a lion are looking for their friend.
130	00:09:06	00:09:07	That's Evelyn.
131	00:09:07	00:09:09	She's wearing her deflector suit.
132	00:09:09	00:09:14	Every night, she comes down to PD at some point, and she files a complaint against them.
133	00:09:14	00:09:16	What did them do to her?
134	00:09:16	00:09:23	Everything, from stealing her thoughts to raping her, but even if she is crazy, she's a variable in all this.
135	00:09:23	00:09:28	See, there may have been some sort of transfer between her and burning man.
136	00:09:28	00:09:30	She didn't stick around for the debrief.
137	00:09:30	00:09:32	Well, can you blame her?
138	00:09:32	00:09:36	She just witnessed spontaneous alien combustion.
139	00:09:36	00:09:38	And you didn't hold her. No.
140	00:09:38	00:09:41	Did you get a statement?
141	00:09:41	00:09:43	Where is she now?
142	00:09:43	00:09:45	We don't know.
143	00:09:45	00:09:47	There's a lot you don't know.
144	00:09:47	00:09:49	You can count on three things happening every day around here.
145	00:09:49	00:09:58	The coffee machine's going to break down; some tourist is going to swear the hooker was over 18; and Evelyn's going to show up.
146	00:09:58	00:10:00	We got a broadcast out.
147	00:10:00	00:10:01	We'll find her.
148	00:10:01	00:10:03	She's very shiny.
149	00:10:15	00:10:17	It's gotta be getting hot under all that foil.
150	00:10:17	00:10:19	She's going to cook out here fast.
151	00:10:19	00:10:21	Aw...
152	00:10:21	00:10:23	Evelyn.
153	00:10:28	00:10:30	What happened?
154	00:10:30	00:10:31	The driver...
155	00:10:31	00:10:32	said his shift was over.
156	00:10:32	00:10:35	He was just taking the truck back to the yard.
157	00:10:35	00:10:38	Said a flash of light came out of nowhere.
158	00:10:43	00:10:46	The sun was just coming up.
159	00:10:46	00:10:48	Reflection off of her suit must have blinded him.
160	00:10:49	00:10:54	Okay, well, this tin foil's evidence in two cases now, so we've got to be careful with it.
161	00:10:57	00:11:00	Butane lighter.
162	00:11:00	00:11:01	It's cracked.
163	00:11:01	00:11:03	Looks empty.
164	00:11:03	00:11:06	That could be what lit the flame in your deer hunter.
165	00:11:06	00:11:07	I'll check the foil for butane.
166	00:11:08	00:11:10	Trouble is, it's probably evaporated by now.
167	00:11:11	00:11:14	200 bucks.
168	00:11:14	00:11:15	Okay, turn her over, Dave.
169	00:11:15	00:11:16	Sure.
170	00:11:20	00:11:22	Guys. We got some green fluid here.
171	00:11:22	00:11:25	It's coming from the wound.
172	00:11:25	00:11:26	Damn!
173	00:11:26	00:11:28	I think that's blood.
174	00:11:54	00:11:56	Take a look.
175	00:11:56	00:11:57	You're not going to believe it.
176	00:11:59	00:12:01	Another 419 with green blood.
177	00:12:01	00:12:03	What are the odds?
178	00:12:05	00:12:07	That he's not connected to our first victim?
179	00:12:07	00:12:08	Astronomical.
180	00:12:08	00:12:11	Looks like blunt-force trauma to me.
181	00:12:11	00:12:14	You know, Tin Foil Lady was run over just a few blocks from here.
182	00:12:14	00:12:17	I bet this area was home to both of them.
183	00:12:35	00:12:36	Three pairs of sunglasses?
184	00:12:45	00:12:47	Earplugs.
185	00:12:47	00:12:53	That, David, is how you make it dark and quiet when you sleep on the street.
186	00:13:02	00:13:04	Hey!
187	00:13:04	00:13:05	I think I found the weapon!
188	00:13:07	00:13:10	We should be able to get some good prints off it.
189	00:13:26	00:13:31	I've seen green blood before, but only from bodies in advanced stages of decomp.
190	00:13:33	00:13:35	What do you think turned it green?
191	00:13:35	00:13:37	I suspect it might be sulfur.
192	00:13:37	00:13:40	Hmm, sulfur's a naturally occurring component of blood.
193	00:13:40	00:13:45	Yes, but in massive doses it tends to turn the blood a blackish avocado green.
194	00:13:45	00:13:50	When the sulfur atom joins the hemoglobin molecules, red blood turns green.
195	00:13:52	00:13:55	Which is why First Officer Spock's blood is green in Star Trek.
196	00:13:55	00:13:56	No, it's not.
197	00:13:56	00:13:58	Uh, yes, it is.
198	00:13:58	00:14:00	Trust me. I'm an expert.
199	00:14:00	00:14:05	Well, apparently not, because otherwise you would surely know that the oxidizing agent in Vulcan blood is copper.
200	00:14:05	00:14:07	And that is why his blood is green.
201	00:14:08	00:14:13	Well, it was that and the fact that he had a Vulcan father, since his mother was actually human.
202	00:14:13	00:14:21	And furthermore, he was promoted to Captain just prior to Star Trek II and then he retired as civilian ambassador.
203	00:14:22	00:14:25	You're like a geeky, nerdy guy trapped in a woman's body.
204	00:14:25	00:14:27	So are you.
205	00:14:31	00:14:40	Well, as I was saying, here on Earth, sulfur-containing compounds could turn otherwise normal blood green.
206	00:14:47	00:14:48	As I suspected.
207	00:14:48	00:14:50	What? Share.
208	00:14:53	00:14:54	She wasn't a Vulcan.
209	00:14:56	00:14:58	Thank you.
210	00:15:03	00:15:07	I don't want to take all the credit, but I do know why both your victims have green blood.
211	00:15:07	00:15:08	High levels of sulfur.
212	00:15:08	00:15:11	Yes.
213	00:15:12	00:15:14	Did you identify the source yet?
214	00:15:14	00:15:19	Not yet. I'll get the blood over to Henry and have him run a tox panel for sulfuric compounds.
215	00:15:19	00:15:25	Oh, and even if your tin foil lady was gushing blood, it would not have contributed to your stun gun guy's immolation.
216	00:15:25	00:15:27	Did you find anything on the foil?
217	00:15:27	00:15:29	Bacon grease and trace amounts of ketchup.
218	00:15:29	00:15:33	Both things you would find at a barbeque, but not the kind that you're dealing with.
219	00:15:35	00:15:36	Brass just called.
220	00:15:36	00:15:39	Our lonely deer hunter's parents just hired a lawyer.
221	00:15:39	00:15:40	The department's going to be sued.
222	00:15:40	00:15:42	We haven't even released the case details yet.
223	00:15:42	00:15:45	Our investigation's still ongoing.
224	00:15:45	00:15:47	Well, they got something we don't.
225	00:15:47	00:15:49	Move! Move! Move!
226	00:15:49	00:15:50	Get away! Get away!
227	00:15:52	00:15:54	Over 60,000 hits since it was posted.
228	00:15:54	00:15:56	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
229	00:15:56	00:16:03	Here, on the PD surveillance, this ambulance chaser on his cell phone-- he's a regular.
230	00:16:03	00:16:06	Want to bet he's the one that shot the footage?
231	00:16:06	00:16:07	Want to bet he's the one filing suit?
232	00:16:08	00:16:12	Well, his cell phone has a better angle than the PD surveillance camera.
233	00:16:12	00:16:14	Archie, run this back to where he gets sprayed.
234	00:16:17	00:16:18	Get away! Wait a minute.
235	00:16:18	00:16:20	Tighten up on the can.
236	00:16:21	00:16:29	Nick, when we did the experiment with Jell-O Man, we used pepper spray from a red can, right?
237	00:16:29	00:16:31	Yeah. Yeah, department-issue.
238	00:16:31	00:16:32	Got it through Logistics.
239	00:16:32	00:16:34	That one's yellow.
240	00:16:37	00:16:40	I've used my pepper spray half a dozen times on the street.
241	00:16:40	00:16:43	All I had to do was write a use-of-force memo.
242	00:16:43	00:16:46	Speaking of memos, didn't you get the one we issued about five years ago?
243	00:16:47	00:16:51	I know what you mean. Yeah, you know, when the department switched over to water-based pepper spray.
244	00:16:51	00:16:54	This one uses isobutane.
245	00:16:54	00:16:56	Compressed gas, highly flammable stuff.
246	00:16:57	00:16:57	Where's yours?
247	00:16:57	00:16:59	It's Murphy's Law, right?
248	00:16:59	00:17:04	I always got my gear together, wired tight, but last night my girl takes my pepper spray.
249	00:17:04	00:17:06	And I don't blame her because she's got a dangerous job.
250	00:17:06	00:17:07	Oh, yeah? What does she do?
251	00:17:07	00:17:09	She goes to WLVU during the day.
252	00:17:09	00:17:13	She studies kinesiology, but she dances nights at the Acid Strip.
253	00:17:15	00:17:17	What does she clip the can to, her G-string?
254	00:17:17	00:17:20	It'd be a deterrent to stuffing a tip in there, wouldn't it?
255	00:17:20	00:17:24	Come on; she walks to the parking lot 00 a.m.
256	00:17:24	00:17:31	Okay, so she takes your department-issue, so what'd you do? Pick up an old can lying around? No, bought one at Catalani's Gun World on the way in.
257	00:17:31	00:17:32	I didn't get a chance to change it out.
258	00:17:32	00:17:34	Does it really matter?
259	00:17:34	00:17:36	It might.
260	00:18:25	00:18:26	Hey, Greg.
261	00:18:26	00:18:29	I just ran your pipe over to Prints after I sampled it for blood.
262	00:18:29	00:18:30	Yeah, did you find something wrong?
263	00:18:30	00:18:32	I found something weird.
264	00:18:32	00:18:34	One end of the pipe was covered with blood from the victim.
265	00:18:34	00:18:38	Yeah, the administrator at the shelter ID'd him as Wayne Connor, homeless.
266	00:18:38	00:18:42	Well, then on the other end of the pipe, I found several small blood smears from an unknown donor.
267	00:18:42	00:18:43	So the killer was also injured.
268	00:18:43	00:18:46	Mm-hmm. His blood's green, too.
269	00:18:47	00:18:49	Once is happenstance.
270	00:18:49	00:18:50	Twice is coincidence.
271	00:18:50	00:18:53	Three times is enemy action.
272	00:18:53	00:18:55	Winston Churchill? Ian Fleming.
273	00:18:55	00:18:57	I should know that.
274	00:18:57	00:18:58	I'm a huge James Bond fan.
275	00:18:58	00:19:01	What aren't you a fan of?
276	00:19:01	00:19:04	I ran the green bloods for sulfur-containing compounds.
277	00:19:04	00:19:11	Still working on the third donor, but Evelyn Polychronopolous and Wayne Connor both had high levels of thiocyte in their systems.
278	00:19:11	00:19:13	Prescription medication for migraines.
279	00:19:13	00:19:15	I checked with the downtown pharmacies.
280	00:19:15	00:19:16	They don't dispense it.
281	00:19:16	00:19:20	154 nanograms per milliliter-- that's overdose levels.
282	00:19:20	00:19:23	Even if they were in a clinical trial, they wouldn't get that much.
283	00:19:24	00:19:27	Yeah, but if you've got a migraine, you'll do anything to stop the pain.
284	00:19:27	00:19:29	How do you know they had migraines?
285	00:19:29	00:19:34	Well, aside from the medication, Connor was wearing three pairs of sunglasses and earplugs.
286	00:19:34	00:19:38	Photo- and phonosensitivity are symptoms of migraines.
287	00:19:38	00:19:41	Maybe that's why Evelyn thought they were invading her brain.
288	00:19:41	00:19:45	She was killed only a few blocks from the vacant lot with a couple hundred dollars on her.
289	00:19:45	00:19:52	She could have been on her way to a drug buy. So if we can figure out who's selling the drugs, it may lead us to who killed Connor.
290	00:20:00	00:20:01	Damn busy day.
291	00:20:01	00:20:03	Hmm, where are they?
292	00:20:03	00:20:04	Inside, end of the hall.
293	00:20:05	00:20:07	Mailman got worried when they didn't come to the door.
294	00:20:07	00:20:09	We did a welfare check, found them both in the bed.
295	00:20:09	00:20:11	Doc.
296	00:20:11	00:20:12	Catherine.
297	00:20:12	00:20:17	No forced entry; no sign of trauma; bodies don't look posed.
298	00:20:17	00:20:20	No gas odor, no petechiae.
299	00:20:20	00:20:22	No sign of suffocation.
300	00:20:22	00:20:23	So why'd you call CSI?
301	00:20:23	00:20:25	Couple in their late 60s.
302	00:20:25	00:20:28	What are the chances they died of natural causes at the same time?
303	00:20:36	00:20:38	Digoxin.
304	00:20:38	00:20:41	Warfarin.
305	00:20:41	00:20:42	Amiodarone.
306	00:20:43	00:20:46	Those are all heart medications. Mm-hmm.
307	00:20:48	00:20:50	Zolpidem.
308	00:20:50	00:20:51	That's for sleep. I know.
309	00:20:51	00:20:53	Bottle's almost full.
310	00:20:53	00:20:56	No foaming at the mouth, no note left behind.
311	00:20:56	00:20:58	I don't think this is a double suicide.
312	00:20:59	00:21:02	Suspicious circs.
313	00:21:02	00:21:04	Good call.
314	00:21:04	00:21:06	They look like they loved each other.
315	00:21:12	00:21:14	Looks like Caddyshack back here.
316	00:21:15	00:21:16	Invasion of the ground squirrels.
317	00:21:17	00:21:19	Yeah, I got a few casualties out here.
318	00:21:19	00:21:21	I see.
319	00:21:21	00:21:23	What the hell is that?
320	00:21:23	00:21:25	Looks like a close encounter, right?
321	00:21:31	00:21:35	Atomic Dave's Painless Removals.
322	00:21:36	00:21:38	Some kind of pest control gizmo.
323	00:21:38	00:21:39	Apparently, it works.
324	00:21:39	00:21:44	I don't think the squirrels would agree that it's painless, though.
325	00:21:48	00:21:51	Shrodinger Martin?
326	00:21:52	00:21:55	He had a cat named Shrodinger.
327	00:21:55	00:21:58	Must have been into physics.
328	00:21:58	00:21:59	Cat grave.
329	00:22:00	00:22:02	Dead cat, dead critters, dead couple.
330	00:22:16	00:22:19	Imagine living next door to that racket.
331	00:22:30	00:22:32	Last night?
332	00:22:32	00:22:35	I was in my studio.
333	00:22:35	00:22:37	I'm an artist.
334	00:22:38	00:22:40	Didn't your neighbors complain about the noise?
335	00:22:41	00:22:43	I don't weld at night.
336	00:22:43	00:22:45	I work on my jewelry.
337	00:22:45	00:22:46	High-end stuff.
338	00:22:47	00:22:48	Nice.
339	00:22:48	00:22:51	Listen, how well did you know your neighbors, the Martins?
340	00:22:51	00:22:52	Are they dead?
341	00:22:52	00:22:53	Yeah.
342	00:22:53	00:22:54	They passed away last night.
343	00:22:54	00:22:56	Hardly knew them.
344	00:22:56	00:22:58	Heard he was a, uh...
345	00:22:58	00:22:59	...professor or something.
346	00:23:00	00:23:01	Yeah, we really didn't have too much in common.
347	00:23:01	00:23:05	Well, apparently, you both shared a ground squirrel problem.
348	00:23:07	00:23:08	Could be worse, I guess.
349	00:23:08	00:23:10	I could still be with my deadbeat ex.
350	00:23:10	00:23:14	There's a pest I did get rid of.
351	00:23:14	00:23:15	Hey, Catherine.
352	00:23:16	00:23:17	Hi.
353	00:23:17	00:23:18	What a relief.
354	00:23:18	00:23:20	Two red-blooded Americans.
355	00:23:20	00:23:25	According to his stomach contents, he likes a glass of red wine with his pasta.
356	00:23:27	00:23:30	Looks like suppertime was about four hours premortem.
357	00:23:31	00:23:33	Take a look at the light board.
358	00:23:35	00:23:37	Both Martins wore pacemakers.
359	00:23:37	00:23:38	Mrs. Martin's is in that bowl.
360	00:23:43	00:23:47	Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
361	00:23:47	00:23:49	Yeah, I hope mine's still working when I pop off.
362	00:23:49	00:23:51	You wear a pacemaker?
363	00:23:51	00:23:54	Bradycardia-- slow heart.
364	00:23:54	00:24:02	Every once in a while, just to make sure I don't skip a beat, the pacer kicks in, just like this one.
365	00:24:02	00:24:05	Well, obviously, they didn't die of pacer malfunction.
366	00:24:10	00:24:11	What you got?
367	00:24:11	00:24:13	Check this out.
368	00:24:13	00:24:16	It's like having a witness to his death inside his body.
369	00:24:16	00:24:19	There's no interruption in his pacemaker functions, but...
370	00:24:19	00:24:23	about eight hours before he died, there was a spike in his heart rate.
371	00:24:23	00:24:28	His wife's is almost identical, so something got their hearts racing.
372	00:24:28	00:24:32	Who knows? Maybe they, uh, enjoyed a little afternoon delight. Well, let's hope.
373	00:24:32	00:24:38	(chuckles) Either way, their heartbeats went back to normal and they died in their sleep a few hours later.
374	00:25:29	00:25:35	Okay, so I've been thinking this over and here's my advice.
375	00:25:35	00:25:38	If you want to get a real relationship with a girl, you are going to have to move out of Mom's.
376	00:25:39	00:25:41	No girl wants the competition.
377	00:25:41	00:25:43	I'm sorry.
378	00:26:02	00:26:04	Oh, God, no, no, turn 'em off. Turn 'em off. Turn 'em off.
379	00:26:05	00:26:07	David Bohr, you're under arrest for the murder of Wayne Connor.
380	00:26:07	00:26:09	No, no, it was self-defense.
381	00:26:10	00:26:12	He tried to kill me over a couple hundred bucks.
382	00:26:13	00:26:14	He needed some stuff.
383	00:26:14	00:26:18	He couldn't pay. He said some money was coming.
384	00:26:18	00:26:19	I had to go to work.
385	00:26:19	00:26:21	I turned to leave and he comes at me like an animal.
386	00:26:21	00:26:23	I have to go. No, no, no, no.
387	00:26:32	00:26:33	This is Captain Brass.
388	00:26:33	00:26:36	We need a Code 3 paramedic response to my location.
389	00:26:36	00:26:38	No!
390	00:28:01	00:28:02	Thanks, man.
391	00:28:02	00:28:03	Hey, I got your page.
392	00:28:03	00:28:04	What's up?
393	00:28:04	00:28:05	I think our cases might be connected.
394	00:28:05	00:28:08	Take a look at that.
395	00:28:11	00:28:18	So my green-blooded victim from the vacant lot was buying pharmaceuticals from the guy who did pest removal for your dead couple.
396	00:28:20	00:28:24	Looks like this guy was trying to create radio frequencies or something.
397	00:28:24	00:28:32	Well, I don't know what kind of effect that has on household pests, but radio waves can produce noise on the channel, which could interfere with pacemaker function.
398	00:28:33	00:28:34	Thing is...
399	00:28:34	00:28:36	the Martins' pacemakers are still ticking.
400	00:28:38	00:28:40	Ah, the luck of the Irish.
401	00:28:40	00:28:42	It makes sense, though.
402	00:28:42	00:28:45	If his blood was green, his organs would be green.
403	00:28:45	00:28:47	Well, frankly, I expected something more in the...
404	00:28:47	00:28:49	dark avocado, almost black range.
405	00:28:49	00:28:52	Yeah, this is more artichoke.
406	00:28:53	00:28:55	You know, atmospheric sulfur levels are on the rise.
407	00:28:55	00:28:58	Hundred years, we're all going to look like spinach.
408	00:28:59	00:29:00	You guys didn't wait for me.
409	00:29:00	00:29:02	We're just about to excise his brain.
410	00:29:02	00:29:06	I'll bet you five bucks, Greg, that his brain is not as green as his heart.
411	00:29:06	00:29:08	Keep your money in your pockets, Greg.
412	00:29:08	00:29:11	There's a higher vascular nature to the heart and lungs.
413	00:29:11	00:29:14	Only the blood vessels in the brain are going to be green.
414	00:29:14	00:29:15	It's a sucker bet and you know it.
415	00:29:15	00:29:17	Well, thanks, Doc.
416	00:29:17	00:29:27	So, uh, Dave here did some humane rodent pest removal for Desert Palm Hospital, which is where he got his hands on the thiocyte.
417	00:29:27	00:29:28	He was all about freedom from pain.
418	00:29:36	00:29:38	Ah.
419	00:29:38	00:29:39	Sea foam.
420	00:29:39	00:29:41	A lovely shade.
421	00:29:54	00:29:56	Look at the size of that.
422	00:29:56	00:30:01	He had a brain tumor pressing on the amygdala.
423	00:30:01	00:30:04	Well, this could cause his migraines.
424	00:30:04	00:30:10	Absolutely, and also aggressive disruptive behavior, paranoia.
425	00:30:10	00:30:15	As the tumor enlarged, it impacted the arteries, causing the cerebral hemorrhage that you observed.
426	00:30:16	00:30:19	He was self-medicating for the wrong condition.
427	00:30:19	00:30:21	No wonder he overdosed.
428	00:30:22	00:30:24	Let 'er rip.
429	00:30:29	00:30:34	In order to interfere with pacemaker function, it'd have to be putting out between 50 and 60 hertz.
430	00:30:35	00:30:37	Okay, I'll input that range. (typing)
431	00:30:44	00:30:47	This thing isn't putting out anything that's lethal.
432	00:30:47	00:30:50	Tox report showed that the medications weren't lethal.
433	00:30:50	00:30:51	This thing's harmless.
434	00:30:51	00:30:53	I refuse to believe it was natural causes.
435	00:30:53	00:30:55	It's too big of a coincidence.
436	00:30:55	00:30:59	So we've got a dead cat and dead squirrels.
437	00:30:59	00:31:02	Maybe what killed them is what killed the Martins.
438	00:31:16	00:31:32	In an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle-- October 31, 1996, if I recall correctly-- one Professor Gilbert Grissom revealed that as a boy, he collected dead animals he found in his Marina del Rey neighborhood and performed necropsies on them.
439	00:31:32	00:31:34	Hodges...
440	00:31:34	00:31:36	I want you to stop stalking me.
441	00:31:43	00:31:46	Bitter almonds.
442	00:31:55	00:31:59	Cyanide crystals in the stomach lining.
443	00:31:59	00:32:04	Yeah, any time you need a sniffer to detect it, my nose has the cyanide gene.
444	00:32:05	00:32:09	What gene turned your nose brown?
445	00:32:09	00:32:11	Go ahead. You can sew him up.
446	00:32:11	00:32:13	Will do.
447	00:32:13	00:32:15	And I'll notify next of kin, too.
448	00:32:18	00:32:19	Ugh.
449	00:32:19	00:32:20	Cyanide is fast-acting.
450	00:32:20	00:32:26	If it killed the squirrels before the crystals were dissolved completely in their stomachs, you'd expect the same thing with the Martins.
451	00:32:27	00:32:28	I saw the Martins' stomach contents.
452	00:32:28	00:32:29	There were no white crystals.
453	00:32:29	00:32:32	Yeah, but maybe if it was ingested in a different manner.
454	00:32:32	00:32:33	Squirrels will eat anything.
455	00:32:33	00:32:37	If the Martins drank it, then that would explain the absence of crystals.
456	00:32:37	00:32:40	I already have Henry running an expanded tox panel.
457	00:32:41	00:32:44	Any minute now.
458	00:32:44	00:32:47	It's cooking.
459	00:32:48	00:32:50	It's coming right up.
460	00:32:50	00:32:52	Yeah.
461	00:32:52	00:32:54	You hear Hodges is looking for his own apartment?
462	00:32:54	00:32:56	Cut the old apron strings.
463	00:32:56	00:32:58	His mother finally kicked him out, huh?
464	00:32:58	00:32:59	Good for her.
465	00:33:03	00:33:06	Lethal levels of cyanide.
466	00:33:06	00:33:08	You can't just walk into a hardware store and pick some up.
467	00:33:08	00:33:10	What about pest control companies?
468	00:33:10	00:33:11	Can they get it? Yeah.
469	00:33:11	00:33:16	And mining companies, uh, electroplaters, photographers, jewelry makers.
470	00:33:16	00:33:18	Thanks, Henry.
471	00:33:18	00:33:20	You can relax now.
472	00:33:27	00:33:29	Look, is this going to take long?
473	00:33:29	00:33:32	Depends on you.
474	00:33:32	00:33:35	'Cause I'm dealing with some really bad news.
475	00:33:35	00:33:38	I just found out my ex died last night.
476	00:33:38	00:33:40	I'm sorry.
477	00:33:40	00:33:43	Yeah, apparently one of you guys blew him up with a stun gun.
478	00:33:43	00:33:45	Kyle Planck is your ex?
479	00:33:45	00:33:50	Tell me, what is it that you two have against God's fur-covered creatures?
480	00:33:50	00:33:51	Is this about that damn cat?
481	00:33:51	00:33:53	For starters, yes.
482	00:33:55	00:33:58	Look, I like cats, all right?
483	00:33:58	00:34:00	It was an accident.
484	00:34:00	00:34:02	You can't just relocate ground squirrels.
485	00:34:02	00:34:04	Okay?
486	00:34:04	00:34:06	I mean, they're... they're disgusting.
487	00:34:06	00:34:07	And I'm an artist.
488	00:34:07	00:34:10	I need a certain environment to work in.
489	00:34:10	00:34:13	Does this environment give you access to cyanide?
490	00:34:13	00:34:16	I use potassium cyanide in electroplating.
491	00:34:16	00:34:18	All my work is custom.
492	00:34:18	00:34:20	And also to poison ground squirrels?
493	00:34:20	00:34:23	I mixed a little with a can of tuna.
494	00:34:23	00:34:25	And I put it out back.
495	00:34:25	00:34:28	But only in my yard.
496	00:34:28	00:34:30	All right, who knew the Martins' cat was going to find it?
497	00:34:30	00:34:38	What? Is that against the law? Actually, irresponsible use of poison is against the law, as well as killing ground squirrels and killing neighbors.
498	00:34:38	00:34:40	What?
499	00:34:40	00:34:43	I didn't... I didn't kill them.
500	00:34:45	00:34:47	Look, we had neighbor issues.
501	00:34:49	00:34:53	Turn that damn thing off before I torch it! You're driving all your squirrels into my yard.
502	00:34:53	00:34:55	All right, look, we're just trying to be humane here.
503	00:34:55	00:34:57	Now you use poison.
504	00:34:57	00:35:01	And you-you killed Shrodinger. You should've kept your cat on your side of the fence, all right.
505	00:35:01	00:35:03	You're causing this problem, not me.
506	00:35:03	00:35:04	Just leave us alone!
507	00:35:06	00:35:09	I killed the squirrels.
508	00:35:09	00:35:12	And possibly their cat.
509	00:35:12	00:35:14	But I am not a murderer.
510	00:35:33	00:35:34	I got nothing.
511	00:35:35	00:35:37	Try the bed.
512	00:35:47	00:35:50	That's...
513	00:35:50	00:35:58	Sorry. I was thinking of one of those, uh, bloodhounds in the old cartoons, Sniffing awound to find da wabbit.
514	00:36:00	00:36:01	This is a gift.
515	00:36:01	00:36:04	Don't make it cheap.
516	00:36:08	00:36:10	Trail's gone cold.
517	00:36:10	00:36:13	So, they died in this room.
518	00:36:13	00:36:15	In bed.
519	00:36:21	00:36:24	Give me a hand with the mattress.
520	00:36:40	00:36:44	Now, get down and sniff the rug.
521	00:36:46	00:36:48	It's all they ever want.
522	00:36:56	00:36:58	Pay dirt.
523	00:37:04	00:37:07	This carpet looks kind of new, right?
524	00:37:07	00:37:10	Yeah.
525	00:37:23	00:37:25	Definitely some combustion there.
526	00:37:31	00:37:36	It looks like they just laid the new carpet right on top of the old, which clearly limited the supply of oxygen.
527	00:37:36	00:37:41	The old carpet melted without bursting into flame.
528	00:37:44	00:37:50	Ironically, older carpets contained polyvinyl chloride used as a flame retardant.
529	00:37:50	00:38:03	So, when it got hot, it probably went into quantitative decomposition, which gave off gases, including hydrogen cyanide.
530	00:38:15	00:38:17	Field work dirty.
531	00:38:17	00:38:20	Dirty, dirty, dirty.
532	00:38:47	00:38:50	Oh! Come on!
533	00:38:56	00:38:58	Your killer's a ground squirrel?
534	00:38:58	00:39:01	In a way, I'd argue self-defense.
535	00:39:26	00:39:27	It was an old house.
536	00:39:28	00:39:29	The wood had desiccated.
537	00:39:29	00:39:31	The short circuit smoldered into the floor joists.
538	00:39:50	00:39:54	Is it bad when you start thinking none of this sounds too weird anymore?
539	00:39:54	00:39:56	Oh, it's a bit too freaky how these cases are connected.
540	00:39:56	00:39:59	Grissom, you always say that there's no such thing as coincidence.
541	00:40:00	00:40:01	There isn't.
542	00:40:01	00:40:02	Oh, come on.
543	00:40:02	00:40:09	You got the guy that burst into flames just divorced from the woman who was fighting squirrel wars with the Martins.
544	00:40:09	00:40:12	Who had hired the exterminator whose drugs were turning everybody's blood green.
545	00:40:12	00:40:19	And one of his green-blooded customers was Evelyn, Our Lady of Tin Foil, the last person that Kyle Planck touched before he died.
546	00:40:19	00:40:21	There's one more connection.
547	00:40:21	00:40:23	Evelyn had 200 bucks.
548	00:40:23	00:40:27	I'm thinking that when she was run over, she was on her way to buy more thiocyte.
549	00:40:27	00:40:33	I think that Wayne Connor was with David Bohr, waiting for the money to arrive.
550	00:40:33	00:40:35	Only Evelyn never showed up.
551	00:40:35	00:40:38	Connor lost his temper, and Bohr killed him in a fight.
552	00:40:38	00:40:42	And it all started with Kyle Planck-- lonely guy with a gut full of moonshine.
553	00:40:42	00:40:45	String theory.
554	00:40:45	00:40:46	Grissom theory.
555	00:40:47	00:40:48	This is better than a bedtime story.
556	00:40:48	00:40:51	String theory is the theory of everything.
557	00:40:51	00:40:54	Quantum mechanics tells us about the very small.
558	00:40:54	00:40:58	The theory of relativity explains the immense.
559	00:40:58	00:40:59	String theory ties it all together.
560	00:40:59	00:41:07	It proposes that atomic particles are made up of infinitesimal, vibrating loops of energy-- or strings.
561	00:41:07	00:41:13	Each string vibrates at its own frequency-- like on a violin, producing notes.
562	00:41:13	00:41:17	And these notes make up everything in the universe.
563	00:41:17	00:41:19	Cosmic symphony.
564	00:41:19	00:41:24	These strings have been combining and recombining ever since the big bang.
565	00:41:24	00:41:32	So, the connections between our victims-- or any of us-- are not that extraordinary.
566	00:41:32	00:41:35	But every one of them thought they were alone.
567	00:41:35	00:41:38	Too bad they didn't know about Grissom's theory.
568	00:41:38	00:41:41	In a parallel universe, maybe they're all having breakfast together.
569	00:41:41	00:41:44	In this universe, maybe we are.
570	00:41:44	00:41:45	Yeah.
571	00:41:45	00:41:46	And you're buying.
572	00:41:47	00:41:50	No strings attached.
