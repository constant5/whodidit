0	00:00:43	00:00:45	Ah, Jeez.
1	00:00:47	00:00:48	All right, guy?
2	00:00:50	00:00:52	I guess he won't be eating dinner tonight.
3	00:01:00	00:01:06	I think Running Man was attacked up there and then dragged or slid down here.
4	00:01:10	00:01:12	Look at those wounds.
5	00:01:12	00:01:15	He picked the wrong time of day to be running alone.
6	00:01:15	00:01:17	Dusk is when the animals come out.
7	00:01:17	00:01:21	Yeah, from what I hear they carved out a piece of this valley when they made the park.
8	00:01:21	00:01:25	Some mountain lion probably didn't like getting relocated.
9	00:01:25	00:01:27	Mountain lions are brutal.
10	00:01:27	00:01:28	And smart.
11	00:01:28	00:01:32	This one evidently knows how to use a scalpel.

13	00:02:17	00:02:18	What are you doing?
14	00:02:18	00:02:20	The carnival case.
15	00:02:20	00:02:21	I'm taking it.
16	00:02:22	00:02:22	The carnival case?
17	00:02:22	00:02:27	A six-year-old girl died on a ride at the carnival over on Washington.
18	00:02:27	00:02:28	The paperwork's on your desk.
19	00:02:28	00:02:31	Did you straighten up my office while you were in there?
20	00:02:31	00:02:33	You think I overstepped?
21	00:02:33	00:02:36	These people come to town they commit crimes and they leave.
22	00:02:36	00:02:39	I just want to get there before the carnival moves on.
23	00:02:39	00:02:42	Okay. Take Sara with you.
24	00:02:42	00:02:45	She's meeting me there.
25	00:02:45	00:02:49	So, Doc how big of a cat are we actually dealing with here?
26	00:02:49	00:02:50	We're not.
27	00:02:50	00:02:52	We're not?
28	00:02:52	00:02:53	You ever owned a kitten?
29	00:02:53	00:02:56	When you play with them, they don't just bite, they scratch.
30	00:02:56	00:02:58	Doesn't matter whether they're tabbies or tigers.
31	00:02:58	00:03:00	And there's no signs of claw wounds on the victim.
32	00:03:03	00:03:04	So what are we dealing with?
33	00:03:04	00:03:05	Forget Whiskers.
34	00:03:05	00:03:06	Think Spot.
35	00:03:06	00:03:08	Teeth marks look canine.
36	00:03:10	00:03:12	I was wrong about the species.
37	00:03:12	00:03:15	I'll make a mold of the bite.
38	00:03:15	00:03:19	If we're lucky we can narrow it down to breed.
39	00:03:21	00:03:22	What?
40	00:03:22	00:03:24	Most people don't admit when they're wrong.
41	00:03:24	00:03:26	I'm wrong all the time.
42	00:03:26	00:03:28	That's how I eventually get to right.
43	00:03:28	00:03:30	You weren't wrong about the scalpel.
44	00:03:30	00:03:33	Whoever removed this guys organs knew how to handle one.
45	00:03:33	00:03:37	So a dog killed him then someone came along and cut him up.
46	00:03:37	00:03:40	Someone with two legs and a medical degree.
47	00:03:57	00:03:59	Stop.
48	00:03:59	00:04:00	What are you doing?
49	00:04:00	00:04:01	That bag's been used 100 times.
50	00:04:01	00:04:02	Get her a new one.
51	00:04:02	00:04:04	They get washed every time, right?
52	00:04:04	00:04:05	Yeah, with disinfectant.
53	00:04:05	00:04:08	What if it was your kid?
54	00:04:10	00:04:12	She gets this one.
55	00:04:12	00:04:14	Yes, ma'am.
56	00:04:19	00:04:21	She looks scared.
57	00:04:21	00:04:24	No six-year-old should have to go through that.
58	00:04:25	00:04:26	You okay?
59	00:04:30	00:04:33	Why don't you go find the mother and talk to her.
60	00:04:33	00:04:34	I'll take the crime scene.
61	00:04:34	00:04:36	Okay.
62	00:04:40	00:04:43	I don't know what happened.
63	00:04:43	00:04:50	One minute Sandy was laughing, holding my hand, and the next...
64	00:04:50	00:04:53	The next, sh...
65	00:04:55	00:04:57	Oh, my God.
66	00:05:03	00:05:04	Mommy!
67	00:05:07	00:05:08	Sandy!
68	00:05:08	00:05:11	Sandy, where are you?
69	00:05:11	00:05:12	I...
70	00:05:12	00:05:17	I got out of the car...
71	00:05:18	00:05:21	but I couldn't find her.
72	00:05:21	00:05:26	By the time I got the operator to stop the ride...
73	00:05:27	00:05:29	she was dead.
74	00:05:29	00:05:32	How can this happen?
75	00:05:32	00:05:34	At a carnival.
76	00:05:36	00:05:38	Go back to the crime scene.
77	00:05:38	00:05:39	Collect the dog's scat.
78	00:05:41	00:05:44	I didn't realize how many dogs take their walks up here when I said that.
79	00:05:44	00:05:47	Yeah, but I bet Grissom did.
80	00:05:47	00:05:49	This sucks.
81	00:05:51	00:05:52	But it's evidence, right?
82	00:05:52	00:05:54	No, hair and fiber is evidence, Warrick.
83	00:05:54	00:05:55	This is combat duty.
84	00:05:55	00:05:57	Yeah, it's somebody's doody.
85	00:05:57	00:05:59	Don't even waste your time.
86	00:05:59	00:06:01	That's cougar.
87	00:06:01	00:06:02	How do you figure that?
88	00:06:04	00:06:06	See the rabbit hair in the feces?
89	00:06:06	00:06:08	Don't you remember the seminar?
90	00:06:08	00:06:10	Seminar?
91	00:06:10	00:06:11	Julie.
92	00:06:11	00:06:15	Julie, oh...
93	00:06:15	00:06:17	A CSI should not be that fine.
94	00:06:22	00:06:23	What is that?
95	00:06:27	00:06:30	Looks like dirty ice.
96	00:06:30	00:06:32	Yeah, well, I'm taking it into evidence.
97	00:06:32	00:06:35	It's evidence of a picnic, Warrick.
98	00:06:37	00:06:40	Yeah, well...
99	00:06:40	00:06:41	we'll see.
100	00:06:42	00:06:44	We've never had a problem with this ride.
101	00:06:44	00:06:46	This is the safest ride we got.
102	00:06:46	00:06:49	Not anymore.
103	00:06:49	00:06:53	So you didn't know that anything was wrong until this car came out of the tunnel, right?
104	00:06:53	00:06:55	As soon as the Mom started screaming I stopped the ride.
105	00:07:02	00:07:03	Seat belt's loose.
106	00:07:04	00:07:05	I check those every morning.
107	00:07:05	00:07:07	Did you check this one?
108	00:07:07	00:07:12	Yeah. So do you strap the riders in, or do they do it themselves?
109	00:07:12	00:07:14	Lady, it's the Tunnel of Love, not Colossus.
110	00:07:14	00:07:17	People like to get up close and personal on this ride.
111	00:07:17	00:07:20	So you keep the belts loose on purpose.
112	00:07:20	00:07:25	Loose enough for adults to get close or six-year-old kids to slide through?
113	00:08:45	00:08:47	Officer, give us a minute.
114	00:08:51	00:08:53	You tampered with the evidence.
115	00:08:53	00:08:55	Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
116	00:08:55	00:08:57	Oh, spare me the Hee Haw routine.
117	00:08:57	00:08:59	You run this nightmare on wheels.
118	00:08:59	00:09:00	I found this in there.
119	00:09:00	00:09:06	You send one of your employees into that tunnel to fix the track where that little girl was killed to cover your ass?
120	00:09:06	00:09:10	Glad you found that, 'cause Puppy's been missing since I rolled into Vegas.
121	00:09:11	00:09:18	Look, I, uh... I'm sorry as the next jim-jim about what happened, ma'am but... I ain't got nothing to do with it.
122	00:09:18	00:09:20	Field test for drugs.
123	00:09:20	00:09:21	I'm sure you've done this before.
124	00:09:22	00:09:23	You can't make me take a drug test.
125	00:09:23	00:09:26	Oh, before you came to Nevada you should've looked up the law.
126	00:09:26	00:09:30	Mandatory drug testing wherever there's been an accident.
127	00:09:30	00:09:32	Pee now, and don't tell me you're shy.
128	00:09:42	00:09:43	Stay on him.
129	00:09:49	00:09:51	Mandatory drug testing?
130	00:09:51	00:09:52	There should be.
131	00:09:52	00:09:55	And I don't have to wait for results to know that guy's coked out of his brain.
132	00:09:55	00:09:57	Cocaine bugs?
133	00:09:57	00:09:58	Oh...
134	00:09:58	00:10:01	Crawling all under his skin.
135	00:10:01	00:10:07	Like David Crosby said, big fella If I'd known I was going to live this long I'd have taken better care of my teeth.
136	00:10:07	00:10:10	Right you are, Mister Crime Scene Investigator.
137	00:10:10	00:10:17	You know, most dogs have 42 teeth but, as you've discovered, your Cujo only has 41.
138	00:10:17	00:10:18	Woof-woof.
139	00:10:18	00:10:21	Did you ever hear a dog say woof-woof, Greg?
140	00:10:22	00:10:24	I mean, what is the origin of that?
141	00:10:24	00:10:26	And what do we sound like to them, I wonder?
142	00:10:26	00:10:27	I don't know.
143	00:10:27	00:10:29	Probably blah, blah, blah.
144	00:10:30	00:10:33	Did you come here with some particular blah, blah, blah for me?
145	00:10:33	00:10:34	Yes.
146	00:10:34	00:10:37	Two words. Paw prints.
147	00:10:37	00:10:40	Your dentally-challenged killer left them all over the vic's clothes.
148	00:10:40	00:10:44	Greg, you know that paw prints are not the same as fingerprints.
149	00:10:44	00:10:48	True, and even if they were, we don't have the database.
150	00:10:48	00:10:51	But they can tell you the size of the dog.
151	00:10:51	00:10:52	And?
152	00:10:52	00:10:56	And according to my sagacious calculations, this is a big dog.
153	00:10:56	00:10:58	At least 100 pounds.
154	00:10:58	00:11:02	Now if we can just figure out where he went to medical school we'll be home free.
155	00:11:02	00:11:09	Huh? The, uh big dog is a Great Dane-Mastiff mix.
156	00:11:09	00:11:12	So my paw prints didn't even help.
157	00:11:12	00:11:14	No, odontology did.
158	00:11:14	00:11:15	Dr. Robbins' dental mold.
159	00:11:15	00:11:19	But, uh it's always nice to have a visit with you, Greg.
160	00:11:19	00:11:20	Thank you.
161	00:11:20	00:11:22	So now you think you're going to find this dog?
162	00:11:22	00:11:28	The array of the bite the squarish impression of the jaw are unique to a Dane or Dane mix.
163	00:11:28	00:11:32	And there are only 40 registered in the greater Las Vegas area.
164	00:11:32	00:11:37	So if one of them is owed a visit by the Tooth Fairy...
165	00:11:37	00:11:40	yes... I think I can.
166	00:11:40	00:11:41	Corn.
167	00:11:41	00:11:42	Hamburger.
168	00:11:42	00:11:43	Rawhide.
169	00:11:43	00:11:46	But no human cellular tissue in this sample.
170	00:11:46	00:11:49	Only 30 more jars to go.
171	00:11:49	00:11:50	This is rough, man.
172	00:11:50	00:11:52	We should be pulling better cases by now.
173	00:11:52	00:11:54	Millionaire murders, casino heists.
174	00:11:54	00:12:00	It's interesting how we categorize evidence in terms of what it means to us as opposed to what it might mean to the case.
175	00:12:00	00:12:03	Uh, we're supposed to like scat patrol?
176	00:12:03	00:12:08	Sometimes we deal with bugs, worms, waste or worse.
177	00:12:08	00:12:15	But as scientists we look beyond the possibly offensive qualities of these things to what they might tell us about the puzzle we're trying to solve.
178	00:12:17	00:12:18	Yeah.
179	00:12:18	00:12:20	Man, do you turn it on like this at your seminars?
180	00:12:20	00:12:23	People actually pay to go to my seminars, Nick.
181	00:12:25	00:12:26	We've I.D.'d the dog.
182	00:12:26	00:12:29	Well, if he's got bits of jogger hanging out of his mouth, cuff him.
183	00:12:29	00:12:31	I pulled those rap sheets.
184	00:12:31	00:12:32	Called around.
185	00:12:32	00:12:33	And?
186	00:12:33	00:12:35	The one with the missing tooth is no angel.
187	00:12:35	00:12:37	He attacked a gas man checking a meter.
188	00:12:37	00:12:41	Took a chunk of thigh and severed a testicle.
189	00:12:48	00:12:50	Can I help you?
190	00:12:50	00:12:51	Are you Susan Hillridge?
191	00:12:51	00:12:53	Yes, Dr. Hillridge.
192	00:12:58	00:13:00	Is this your dog Doctor?
193	00:13:01	00:13:01	Yes, Simba.
194	00:13:01	00:13:04	Well, you have a problem.
195	00:13:04	00:13:05	Oh, no. Not again.
196	00:13:12	00:13:14	What makes you think Simba was involved?
197	00:13:15	00:13:17	There have been complaints about your dog in the past.
198	00:13:18	00:13:19	Your meter reader's singing soprano.
199	00:13:20	00:13:21	Oh, I get it now.
200	00:13:21	00:13:23	You're talking about my old dog, Dickie.
201	00:13:23	00:13:24	He was aggressive.
202	00:13:24	00:13:26	That's why I put him down.
203	00:13:26	00:13:27	Simba just gets out of the yard a lot.
204	00:13:28	00:13:31	The dog we're looking for is missing a tooth.
205	00:13:31	00:13:36	I noticed that Simba is also missing a tooth.
206	00:13:36	00:13:38	Okay, he is missing a tooth.
207	00:13:38	00:13:41	But he just gets out and wrestles with neighbors' garbage cans.
208	00:13:41	00:13:42	He's not a violent dog.
209	00:13:42	00:13:44	That may be.
210	00:13:44	00:13:49	We still have to take him into custody until we can determine whether or not he had any involvement in this homicide.
211	00:13:49	00:13:51	Officers, go ahead. He's all yours.
212	00:13:51	00:13:54	You're making a mistake.
213	00:13:54	00:13:57	You said that you were a doctor.
214	00:13:57	00:13:59	May I ask your specialty?
215	00:13:59	00:14:00	Nutrition.
216	00:14:00	00:14:02	My patients are mostly professional athletes.
217	00:14:02	00:14:06	Do you ever consult with amateur athletes?
218	00:14:06	00:14:07	Like marathoners?
219	00:14:07	00:14:09	You mean like that jogger? What was his name?
220	00:14:09	00:14:10	Terry Manning.
221	00:14:10	00:14:11	Doesn't ring a bell.
222	00:14:12	00:14:13	And I'm very good with names, Mr. Grissom.
223	00:14:13	00:14:15	You'll let me know when I can pick up Simba.
224	00:14:15	00:14:17	You're assuming a lot.
225	00:14:17	00:14:18	So are you.
226	00:14:20	00:14:23	So you did the tox screen on my carnie?
227	00:14:23	00:14:25	Roger that.
228	00:14:25	00:14:29	You know, I have seen guys drink, like, five gallons of water to try and dilute their urine.
229	00:14:29	00:14:31	It's the old straight flush.
230	00:14:31	00:14:34	But all Bad Boy Sanders has to do is just test the specific gravity and blammo.
231	00:14:34	00:14:36	I can still catch their toxic butts.
232	00:14:36	00:14:37	Mm-hmm.
233	00:14:37	00:14:38	So?
234	00:14:38	00:14:41	So your guy didn't do that.
235	00:14:41	00:14:42	Great.
236	00:14:43	00:14:44	What'd he do? Try and mask it?
237	00:14:44	00:14:45	No.
238	00:14:45	00:14:48	Oh, come on, that creep tested clean?
239	00:14:48	00:14:49	Yeah.
240	00:14:49	00:14:51	For someone who's on the pill.
241	00:14:51	00:14:52	What?
242	00:14:52	00:14:56	He's got synthetic estrogen in his urine sample.
243	00:14:56	00:14:58	Should modulate his mood swings.
244	00:14:58	00:14:59	Oldest trick in the book.
245	00:14:59	00:15:01	Somebody else's urine.
246	00:15:01	00:15:03	Probably keeps a stash in his trailer.
247	00:15:03	00:15:06	And that Uniform was too green to look for it.
248	00:15:06	00:15:09	Isn't that in the Constitution somewhere?
249	00:15:09	00:15:11	A man's inalienable right to pee in private?
250	00:15:11	00:15:14	Hey, I just got off the phone with OSHA.
251	00:15:14	00:15:18	Our carnival has violations in eight states.
252	00:15:18	00:15:19	What a surprise.
253	00:15:19	00:15:20	But that's not all.
254	00:15:20	00:15:22	More than half these guys have records.
255	00:15:22	00:15:24	And Pickens, the boss?
256	00:15:24	00:15:26	His real name is Roger Peet.
257	00:15:26	00:15:28	He's a convicted sex offender on parole.
258	00:15:28	00:15:30	Let's go.
259	00:15:32	00:15:35	How was I supposed to know she's 16 and a half?
260	00:15:35	00:15:38	From the neck down she was all grown up.
261	00:15:38	00:15:41	You know what I mean?
262	00:15:41	00:15:43	I have a teenage daughter.
263	00:15:43	00:15:46	So, no, I don't know what you mean.
264	00:15:49	00:15:50	Jerry Lee Lewis, man.
265	00:15:51	00:15:53	Same thing happened to him.
266	00:15:53	00:15:56	What's all this got to do with the little dead girl, anyway?
267	00:15:56	00:15:57	You tell us.
268	00:15:57	00:16:05	I was walking down the midway and I seen this woman come whishing out of the tunnel screaming for her daughter.
269	00:16:05	00:16:08	My baby! My baby!
270	00:16:08	00:16:09	My baby!
271	00:16:09	00:16:15	Me and Joey, he's the Operator we hit the kill switch, stop the ride ran in the tunnel and look for the kid.
272	00:16:15	00:16:19	And I seen her laying facedown in the pool of water.
273	00:16:19	00:16:20	What did you do?
274	00:16:20	00:16:21	I didn't do nothing.
275	00:16:21	00:16:24	She was dead.
276	00:16:24	00:16:26	I didn't come within two feet of her.
277	00:16:26	00:16:28	I'm sorry about what happened.
278	00:16:28	00:16:32	But that's all that I know.
279	00:16:33	00:16:36	If you so much as breathed on this child the evidence will tell me.
280	00:16:36	00:16:45	You can dope your urine change your name compare yourself to Elvis himself but if you harmed Sandy Dantini, I'm going to get you.
281	00:16:54	00:16:56	You worried you tipped your hand in there?
282	00:16:56	00:16:57	No.
283	00:16:57	00:17:01	Look, don't bite my head off, but any chance you're going after this guy because you're a mother?
284	00:17:01	00:17:05	Pickens is a drug addict and sex offender operating a two-ton kid magnet.
285	00:17:05	00:17:08	Did you take a look around that carnival?
286	00:17:08	00:17:09	Yeah.
287	00:17:09	00:17:11	Did you notice anything about those other rides?
288	00:17:11	00:17:12	Maybe.
289	00:17:12	00:17:13	Ferris wheel-- single cars in the open.
290	00:17:13	00:17:15	Zipper-- single cars in the open.
291	00:17:15	00:17:18	Himalaya-- group cars in the open.
292	00:17:18	00:17:21	How come Pickens was hanging around the only ride that takes kids into the dark?
293	00:17:24	00:17:26	What if he pulled that little girl out of the car?
294	00:17:26	00:17:29	You have anything to support that?
295	00:17:31	00:17:33	Hey.
296	00:17:33	00:17:35	We aren't going to lunch are we?
297	00:17:35	00:17:41	Simba's mold's still damp, but you can see it's a perfect match to the bite mark on the jogger.
298	00:17:41	00:17:43	Does this mean Simba's going to the big dog pound in the sky?
299	00:17:44	00:17:46	No, we need to build some more evidence.
300	00:17:46	00:17:48	Find some jogger in Simba's stool.
301	00:17:48	00:17:51	Well, I can tell you we found a unique sample at the crime scene.
302	00:17:51	00:17:55	Great Dane-sized scat containing bits of premium pet store kibble.
303	00:17:55	00:17:57	How premium?
304	00:17:57	00:17:59	Sirloin, rice, nothing artificial.
305	00:17:59	00:18:02	We need to find out what Dr. Hillridge feeds her dog.
306	00:18:03	00:18:05	Just coming to see you.
307	00:18:05	00:18:08	You remember that ice we found at the crime scene?
308	00:18:08	00:18:10	There's nothing in here.
309	00:18:10	00:18:11	It didn't melt. It evaporated.
310	00:18:11	00:18:12	Dry ice.
311	00:18:13	00:18:16	Frozen CO2 sublimates into invisible gas, not water.
312	00:18:16	00:18:19	The jogger was missing some organs.
313	00:18:19	00:18:22	Surgical teams use dry ice to pack organs shipped for transplant.
314	00:18:22	00:18:25	It just so happens the dog's owner is a doctor.
315	00:18:25	00:18:26	Surgeon?
316	00:18:26	00:18:27	Nutritionist.
317	00:18:27	00:18:30	But all medical residents have surgical rotations.
318	00:18:30	00:18:32	Fellas, we have a doctor's appointment.
319	00:19:35	00:19:39	Would you mind if I looked in your freezer?
320	00:19:39	00:19:45	I have a patient coming in exactly 20 minutes so if you want to rifle around until then, fine but I will not leave my place of business.
321	00:19:45	00:19:46	No one's asked you to.
322	00:20:09	00:20:12	You're very organized, Dr. Hillridge.
323	00:20:12	00:20:16	I imagine you're upset about your dog-- having to put him down.
324	00:20:16	00:20:18	I don't hold onto things.
325	00:20:18	00:20:21	I accept the evolution of change.
326	00:20:21	00:20:24	We live, we die, we replenish the earth.
327	00:20:24	00:20:26	Man's best friend...
328	00:20:26	00:20:28	but not yours, huh?
329	00:20:28	00:20:30	None of us gets out alive.
330	00:20:30	00:20:33	I would think in your job you'd know that.
331	00:20:33	00:20:39	But if we treat our bodies like a temple we can cheat time.
332	00:20:39	00:20:41	Your eyes...
333	00:20:41	00:20:43	What?
334	00:20:43	00:20:44	The lower rims are pale.
335	00:20:44	00:20:46	You're deficient in folic acid.
336	00:20:46	00:20:48	You're not eating your beets.
337	00:20:48	00:20:50	Two beets have 541/////2% percent of the RDA.
338	00:21:01	00:21:04	May I ask you what medical school you attended?
339	00:21:04	00:21:06	Will that help with your investigation?
340	00:21:07	00:21:08	I just thought the way you handled that knife...
341	00:21:09	00:21:10	Oh, the knife. No.
342	00:21:10	00:21:11	I was in the CIA.
343	00:21:12	00:21:16	Culinary Institute of America.
344	00:21:20	00:21:27	Tell me, Mr. Grissom how does a man choose death as his profession?
345	00:21:27	00:21:29	It chose me, actually.
346	00:21:29	00:21:32	I guess one man's corpse is another man's candy.
347	00:21:32	00:21:33	Care for a sip?
348	00:21:33	00:21:34	It's full of folacin.
349	00:21:34	00:21:36	No, thanks.
350	00:21:37	00:21:40	Griss, can I show you something?
351	00:21:42	00:21:43	Excuse me.
352	00:21:48	00:21:51	Surgery equipment.
353	00:21:51	00:21:57	Emory Medical Supplies, Boston, Mass, 1875.
354	00:21:57	00:22:00	Antiques.
355	00:22:01	00:22:03	Boy, these are well maintained.
356	00:22:03	00:22:05	Exactly.
357	00:22:05	00:22:09	What I find interesting is that she keeps them near the door, not in the office.
358	00:22:10	00:22:12	In case she needs to break out and go do some work.
359	00:22:13	00:22:16	Maybe she makes house calls.
360	00:22:18	00:22:19	May we help you?
361	00:22:19	00:22:21	Yes, is Dr. Hillridge around?
362	00:22:21	00:22:22	00.
363	00:22:25	00:22:26	Edwin.
364	00:22:26	00:22:28	You look great today.
365	00:22:28	00:22:29	How'd the race go?
366	00:22:29	00:22:31	I finished in three hours and ten minutes.
367	00:22:31	00:22:33	You can do better.
368	00:22:44	00:22:45	She gives me the willies.
369	00:22:45	00:22:47	We can't arrest her for that.
370	00:22:47	00:22:50	Yeah, well, maybe we can link these to the crime.
371	00:22:50	00:22:54	Her dog may have eaten that jogger but he can't harvest the organs.
372	00:22:54	00:22:58	No question about it, the cause of death is drowning.
373	00:22:58	00:22:59	How tall was the victim?
374	00:23:00	00:23:02	Three feet, give or take an inch.
375	00:23:02	00:23:05	The water was a foot and a half deep.
376	00:23:05	00:23:09	She could've easily climbed out, unless she was unconscious.
377	00:23:09	00:23:11	Maybe she had a minor concussion, or was stunned.
378	00:23:11	00:23:13	That could explain why she couldn't get out.
379	00:23:13	00:23:15	I checked, believe me. She didn't.
380	00:23:15	00:23:19	The only injury I could find on this little girl was a fractured forearm.
381	00:23:20	00:23:21	Spiral or straight?
382	00:23:21	00:23:22	X-rays just came back.
383	00:23:22	00:23:23	Let's see.
384	00:23:32	00:23:33	Spiral.
385	00:23:33	00:23:35	That's not from a fall.
386	00:23:35	00:23:39	Somebody twisted that little girl's arm hard enough to break it.
387	00:23:40	00:23:41	Perimortem?
388	00:23:42	00:23:45	Swelling takes at least two to four minutes of active circulation.
389	00:23:45	00:23:49	There's no swelling, so it had to happen moments before she died.
390	00:23:49	00:23:52	So someone did yank her out of that car in the dark.
391	00:23:52	00:23:54	Mommy!
392	00:23:54	00:23:57	Sandy!
393	00:23:57	00:23:59	Wait.
394	00:23:59	00:24:02	Pickens yanks her out just so he can drown her?
395	00:24:02	00:24:03	He's a sex offender.
396	00:24:03	00:24:05	He was going to take her someplace.
397	00:24:05	00:24:06	Not without someone seeing him.
398	00:24:06	00:24:08	You read the OSHA report.
399	00:24:08	00:24:10	How many emergency doors were operational?
400	00:24:10	00:24:12	None.
401	00:24:12	00:24:16	He was trapped like a rat.
402	00:24:18	00:24:23	He did the only thing he could-- he hid the evidence.
403	00:24:25	00:24:27	Drowned the little girl.
404	00:24:29	00:24:31	I'm going to go call Brass.
405	00:24:32	00:24:35	You're going to enter this as a homicide, right?
406	00:24:35	00:24:39	Technically, it's somewhere between accidental and undetermined.
407	00:24:39	00:24:40	It's a homicide.
408	00:24:40	00:24:41	I'm going to get your proof.
409	00:24:41	00:24:43	So write down that accidental in pencil.
410	00:24:54	00:24:55	Can you help me?
411	00:24:55	00:24:58	I need to find out when my daughter's going to be released.
412	00:24:59	00:25:00	I'm not a coroner. What's your daughter's name?
413	00:25:00	00:25:02	Sandy Dantini.
414	00:25:02	00:25:05	Oh, Mrs. Dantini.
415	00:25:05	00:25:07	I'm Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
416	00:25:07	00:25:10	You've spoken with my colleague, Sara Sidle.
417	00:25:10	00:25:12	I'm so sorry.
418	00:25:14	00:25:19	Um... did you find out what happened at the carnival to my baby?
419	00:25:19	00:25:22	Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
420	00:25:22	00:25:29	Is it possible that someone reached into your car and pulled out your daughter?
421	00:25:30	00:25:34	I... thought it was an accident.
422	00:25:34	00:25:38	You read all the time about how dangerous amusement parks can be.
423	00:25:38	00:25:40	You think it can never happen to you.
424	00:25:40	00:25:44	You think you can protect your kids.
425	00:25:46	00:25:52	Well, when you went in the water to try to save Sandy did you hear anything?
426	00:25:52	00:25:56	Did you... sense that anyone was there... in the dark?
427	00:25:59	00:26:00	I-I-I don't know.
428	00:26:00	00:26:04	I mean, well, you know, it all happened so fast.
429	00:26:04	00:26:06	I was... focused on finding Sandy.
430	00:26:08	00:26:09	Do you...
431	00:26:09	00:26:12	do you think someone else was there?
432	00:26:14	00:26:18	I'm not ruling anything out.
433	00:26:32	00:26:33	Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
434	00:26:33	00:26:37	I may have recycled a few caskets but you're talking about a whole different ball game, here.
435	00:26:37	00:26:39	Mr. Gesek, I'm not accusing you of anything.
436	00:26:39	00:26:41	I'm not even here officially.
437	00:26:41	00:26:44	Think of yourself as a consultant to the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
438	00:26:44	00:26:46	Do I get paid?
439	00:26:48	00:26:50	What do you know about organ theft?
440	00:26:50	00:26:53	Oh, if I was in that business I wouldn't worry about getting paid.
441	00:26:53	00:26:57	You know there are places overseas that'll pay 50 grand for one lung?
442	00:26:58	00:26:59	60 for a heart?
443	00:26:59	00:27:01	And you know this because...?
444	00:27:01	00:27:02	Not firsthand.
445	00:27:02	00:27:03	Not even secondhand.
446	00:27:03	00:27:06	At the last funeral directors' convention...
447	00:27:06	00:27:07	you'd be amazed what you hear.
448	00:27:07	00:27:11	But, you know, it takes a lot to keep a business afloat.
449	00:27:11	00:27:14	Tell me about the local market for organs.
450	00:27:15	00:27:17	Well, we're talking about life and death.
451	00:27:17	00:27:18	It's probably pretty good.
452	00:27:18	00:27:23	If someone was disemboweled and their liver taken what would that go for?
453	00:27:23	00:27:24	Menu, everything a la carte.
454	00:27:25	00:27:26	Corneas, $5,000.
455	00:27:26	00:27:27	Kidney, $20,000.
456	00:27:27	00:27:28	Liver, 40.
457	00:27:28	00:27:29	Bowel, 30.
458	00:27:29	00:27:30	Pancreas, 18.
459	00:27:33	00:27:36	It's amazing what you can learn at a convention.
460	00:27:37	00:27:38	Warrick.
461	00:27:38	00:27:39	I got a match.
462	00:27:39	00:27:40	Cool. Yeah.
463	00:27:40	00:27:42	You want to hand me those filter papers right there?
464	00:27:42	00:27:47	The scat I found at the crime scene and the scat from the doctor's house were the same, except for one difference.
465	00:27:47	00:27:51	The stuff from the backyard-- full of human cellular tissue.
466	00:27:51	00:27:53	Jogger DNA.
467	00:27:53	00:27:54	So we got the right dog.
468	00:27:56	00:28:00	Well, let's see if the owner cut the vic up.
469	00:28:01	00:28:02	Reactive agents.
470	00:28:03	00:28:05	One part leuko-malachite.
471	00:28:05	00:28:08	One part hydrogen peroxide-- used by blondes everywhere.
472	00:28:15	00:28:16	Blue.
473	00:28:16	00:28:17	Weird, isn't it?
474	00:28:17	00:28:18	What's that?
475	00:28:18	00:28:21	To prove the presence of heme the stuff that makes blood red...
476	00:28:21	00:28:22	Turns the swab blue.
477	00:28:22	00:28:24	Yeah.
478	00:28:24	00:28:27	I own this attraction and it's going with me to the next town.
479	00:28:27	00:28:29	It's evidence.
480	00:28:29	00:28:30	It's not going anywhere. Nothing is.
481	00:28:31	00:28:32	What, says you two string beans?
482	00:28:32	00:28:36	It's going to take a lot more than vegetable insults to get us to move.
483	00:28:36	00:28:37	Lady, you don't know who you're messing with.
484	00:28:37	00:28:41	Oh, I know exactly who you are, Mr. Pickens.
485	00:28:41	00:28:48	And if you so much as look at me in the wrong way, I will personally lock you in a cell with someone who's going to do the same thing to you that you've been doing to those little girls.
486	00:28:48	00:28:49	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
487	00:28:49	00:28:51	What, you start the party without me?
488	00:28:51	00:28:53	That could get dangerous.
489	00:28:55	00:28:56	Thomas Pickens?
490	00:28:56	00:28:57	Yeah.
491	00:28:58	00:28:58	I got a court order.
492	00:28:59	00:29:01	This ride stays in Vegas and you're coming with me.
493	00:29:01	00:29:03	You pullin' my pud?
494	00:29:03	00:29:05	You know, the thought never crossed my mind.
495	00:29:05	00:29:06	Come on.
496	00:29:11	00:29:12	What?
497	00:29:13	00:29:15	Nothing.
498	00:29:15	00:29:17	This is fun.
499	00:29:17	00:29:18	As compared to what?
500	00:29:19	00:29:21	As compared to a more scientific approach.
501	00:29:23	00:29:24	I'm sorry, guys.
502	00:29:24	00:29:26	If she cut up that jogger she didn't use that scalpel.
503	00:29:26	00:29:29	But we found evidence of blood on it.
504	00:29:29	00:29:32	I had Sanders run a degradation on that same sample.
505	00:29:32	00:29:34	The blood is 50 to 200 years old.
506	00:29:34	00:29:39	Antique, like the scalpel ruling out the possibility it was used in the murder of our jogger.
507	00:29:41	00:29:42	Yeah.
508	00:29:44	00:29:45	I'll be right out.
509	00:29:48	00:29:49	I have a visitor.
510	00:30:00	00:30:01	Hi.
511	00:30:01	00:30:02	I have folic acid.
512	00:30:02	00:30:04	I was worried about your eyes.
513	00:30:04	00:30:09	I assume my surgical instruments came back clean, or relatively clean.
514	00:30:10	00:30:15	Are you here for a nutritional consultation or to eavesdrop on my investigation?
515	00:30:15	00:30:20	Actually, my house felt a little crowded-- all those men you sent.
516	00:30:22	00:30:25	The, uh, police sent them.
517	00:30:25	00:30:26	But you dictated the scope of the warrant.
518	00:30:26	00:30:28	They're taking everything from my kitchen and office.
519	00:30:29	00:30:33	You have three prior complaints in three separate states for owning vicious dogs.
520	00:30:33	00:30:35	And?
521	00:30:35	00:30:37	What else do you know about me?
522	00:30:37	00:30:40	Each complaint is from a mountain state.
523	00:30:40	00:30:42	Is it a crime to like the mountains?
524	00:30:42	00:30:43	No.
525	00:30:43	00:30:47	Only if we find other joggers have turned up dead.
526	00:30:49	00:30:51	What's a liver go for these days, Doc?
527	00:30:51	00:30:53	What?
528	00:30:53	00:30:57	Terry Manning was missing several key organs-- healthy organs.
529	00:30:57	00:30:58	You disappoint me.
530	00:30:58	00:31:01	I thought you were smarter than that.
531	00:31:01	00:31:05	Coenzyme Q-10 could help with mental acuity.
532	00:31:11	00:31:14	The last act is bloody however fine the rest of the play.
533	00:31:14	00:31:16	Pascal.
534	00:31:16	00:31:19	Very impressive.
535	00:31:19	00:31:22	I prefer Buddha, though.
536	00:31:22	00:31:26	Even death is not to be feared by those who lived wisely.
537	00:31:26	00:31:28	One request.
538	00:31:28	00:31:30	Ask them not to leave my house a mess.
539	00:31:30	00:31:32	You know how I like order.
540	00:31:50	00:31:52	What, are you guys working in bulk now?
541	00:31:52	00:31:54	Hey, you're the one who said that lady doc keeps skipping town.
542	00:31:54	00:31:58	If the jogger's blood is in any of this stuff, we need to find it now.
543	00:31:58	00:32:02	This is only part of the kitchen-- the rest is in those bags and boxes.
544	00:32:02	00:32:03	I'm ready, Nick.
545	00:32:03	00:32:04	You want to hit the lights?
546	00:32:32	00:32:38	She made a protein shake in this yesterday right in front of me.
547	00:32:38	00:32:41	Why would she do that?
548	00:32:41	00:32:45	Get this to DNA-- see if this is the jogger's blood.
549	00:32:45	00:32:48	I'd place a bet on it.
550	00:32:51	00:32:52	Whoa, whoa.
551	00:32:52	00:32:57	So she's not selling the organs on the black market... she's eating them?
552	00:32:59	00:33:01	Possibly drinking them.
553	00:33:18	00:33:20	I want four techs in there placed four feet apart.
554	00:33:20	00:33:23	Let's try to pull the girl out from every conceivable angle.
555	00:33:23	00:33:30	Okay, based on our theory a loose seat belt enabled Pickens to yank the little girl out of her seat.
556	00:33:33	00:33:35	Mom was on the left.
557	00:33:37	00:33:39	42 pounds?
558	00:33:41	00:33:43	Just like little Sandy.
559	00:33:44	00:33:46	And, just like...
560	00:33:46	00:33:50	the loose seat belt.
561	00:34:28	00:34:31	The belt wasn't loose enough to yank the girl out.
562	00:34:33	00:34:35	Forget Pickens.
563	00:34:35	00:34:40	The only person who could've done it, then is the person that was in the car with her-- the mother.
564	00:34:40	00:34:43	Her eyes were pointing in the wrong direction.
565	00:34:43	00:34:45	I'm sorry, what?
566	00:34:46	00:34:50	Carla Dantini was looking left when she told me about the accident.
567	00:34:53	00:34:59	When a person is remembering, they look right and when they're creating, they look left.
568	00:34:59	00:35:02	And by creating, you mean fabricating.
569	00:35:02	00:35:06	Neurolinguistics programming human behavioral science.
570	00:35:07	00:35:10	Call Brass and tell him to meet us at the mother's house.
571	00:35:20	00:35:21	Mr. Grissom.
572	00:35:21	00:35:24	You're looking grim.
573	00:35:24	00:35:26	I'm afraid I don't have a supplement for that.
574	00:35:26	00:35:30	We found blood in your kitchen blender.
575	00:35:30	00:35:33	The lab has matched it to the dead jogger.
576	00:35:34	00:35:37	It had to happen eventually.
577	00:35:37	00:35:38	Why?
578	00:35:38	00:35:39	You're the scientist.
579	00:35:39	00:35:42	I should have thought you'd figured that out.
580	00:35:42	00:35:45	I haven't.
581	00:35:45	00:35:47	Think of the bugs, Grissom.
582	00:35:47	00:35:49	Cycle of life?
583	00:35:49	00:35:51	Angels versus insects?
584	00:35:51	00:35:58	When we die the fable we tell ourselves is we go toward a white light and angels.
585	00:35:58	00:36:05	But you and I both know the hard reality is that insects arrive immediately and begin turning us back to earth.
586	00:36:05	00:36:07	Yes.
587	00:36:07	00:36:09	But the insects haven't killed anyone.
588	00:36:09	00:36:11	No.
589	00:36:11	00:36:15	But they'd die if they didn't have bodies to feed off of.
590	00:36:15	00:36:16	And so will I.
591	00:36:18	00:36:20	Porphyria.
592	00:36:20	00:36:24	The madness of King George.
593	00:36:24	00:36:26	Or the legend of the vampire.
594	00:36:26	00:36:29	Which makes it a real hard disease to have.
595	00:36:31	00:36:32	But it's real for me.
596	00:36:32	00:36:34	It's genetic.
597	00:36:34	00:36:37	The only thing my father ever gave me.
598	00:36:40	00:36:45	The first time it presented was after a minor sunburn.
599	00:36:45	00:36:48	My lips receded, so did my gums.
600	00:36:48	00:36:51	I increased my glucose intake and I was fine...
601	00:36:52	00:36:53	for a while.
602	00:36:53	00:36:56	I began a drug regimen.
603	00:36:56	00:36:58	But they only treated the symptoms.
604	00:36:58	00:37:01	I had my spleen removed because it absorbed my blood.
605	00:37:02	00:37:04	But nothing helped.
606	00:37:04	00:37:07	Lesions started forming on my face.
607	00:37:07	00:37:10	That's when I bought my first dog.
608	00:37:10	00:37:13	Bullets and poison leave residue in the blood.
609	00:37:13	00:37:16	Dogs kill clean.
610	00:37:16	00:37:19	Imagine what I'd look like by now without them.
611	00:37:27	00:37:30	You could've tried intravenous hematin.
612	00:37:30	00:37:33	Human blood is the richest source of heme.
613	00:37:33	00:37:38	And so you extracted the organs with the most blood-- the liver, the spleen, the heart.
614	00:37:38	00:37:42	If you lock me up, I'll go mad.
615	00:37:42	00:37:45	Unfortunately, a symptom of your condition.
616	00:37:45	00:37:47	But you've been killing people, Doctor.
617	00:37:47	00:37:49	I'll die in prison.
618	00:37:49	00:37:53	Yes, but the people you'd be feeding off of will still be alive.
619	00:37:55	00:37:56	Cycle of life.
620	00:37:58	00:38:00	Sergeant.
621	00:38:06	00:38:10	You're under arrest for the murder of Terry Manning.
622	00:38:14	00:38:16	You have one more question.
623	00:38:16	00:38:19	How could I consume raw organs?
624	00:38:19	00:38:22	Not morally, aesthetically.
625	00:38:24	00:38:27	I dried them and ground them into powder.
626	00:38:30	00:38:31	Protein powder.
627	00:38:31	00:38:37	You want an empirical experience?
628	00:38:37	00:38:39	There's a fresh shake in my fridge.
629	00:38:39	00:38:42	Let's go.
630	00:38:49	00:38:50	Officer.
631	00:38:54	00:38:56	She is nuts, right?
632	00:38:59	00:39:02	She's a cold-blooded killer.
633	00:39:04	00:39:05	You got the warrant, right?
634	00:39:05	00:39:07	Yeah, but it's limited in scope.
635	00:39:07	00:39:11	The boyfriend's an attorney so we can't toss the place.
636	00:39:11	00:39:12	Mrs. Dantini.
637	00:39:12	00:39:15	You have news about Sandy?
638	00:39:15	00:39:17	We may have a lead.
639	00:39:17	00:39:20	We need to see the clothes that you wore the day that your daughter died.
640	00:39:21	00:39:21	Why?
641	00:39:22	00:39:22	It's okay, honey.
642	00:39:23	00:39:24	I'm Hugh Young, Mrs. Dantini's attorney.
643	00:39:24	00:39:25	Carla's grieving. We both are.
644	00:39:25	00:39:27	Can't this wait till after the funeral?
645	00:39:27	00:39:29	No, it can't.
646	00:39:31	00:39:32	Where's your bedroom?
647	00:39:34	00:39:37	So this is everything that you wore at the carnival last night?
648	00:39:37	00:39:39	Yes.
649	00:39:42	00:39:43	Your watch is waterlogged.
650	00:39:48	00:39:52	Yes. I went into the water after my daughter.
651	00:39:52	00:39:53	So, you jumped in the water.
652	00:39:53	00:39:55	Yes.
653	00:39:59	00:40:02	How come your shoes are dry?
654	00:40:02	00:40:04	Well... it was yesterday.
655	00:40:04	00:40:06	Of course they're dry.
656	00:40:06	00:40:09	The lining's blue.
657	00:40:09	00:40:14	If they'd gotten wet the indigo dye would have bled onto your white socks.
658	00:40:14	00:40:16	You never went in the water.
659	00:40:16	00:40:19	If you didn't go into the water how did your watch get wet?
660	00:40:19	00:40:23	Like I told her reaching for my daughter.
661	00:40:23	00:40:26	You reached for her all right.
662	00:40:35	00:40:36	My baby!
663	00:40:40	00:40:45	And when she managed to grab onto you you broke her arm.
664	00:40:46	00:40:51	And you held her under while you sat in that car until you drowned her.
665	00:40:51	00:40:56	Carla is any of this true?
666	00:40:59	00:41:00	I want you to leave.
667	00:41:03	00:41:06	You took your daughter to the carnival 'cause kids get hurt there all the time.
668	00:41:06	00:41:08	You thought the blame would leave town with the ride.
669	00:41:08	00:41:10	Well, you should have planned better.
670	00:41:10	00:41:11	What did you actually think?
671	00:41:11	00:41:14	That you and your boyfriend would run off like newlyweds?
672	00:41:14	00:41:16	No kid, no cares?
673	00:41:16	00:41:17	I never thought anything like that.
674	00:41:18	00:41:19	She did.
675	00:41:19	00:41:21	Didn't you?
676	00:41:27	00:41:29	I'm going to need a new lawyer.
677	00:41:36	00:41:38	Bag the evidence. Arrest her, Jim.
678	00:41:40	00:41:43	Hey...
679	00:41:43	00:41:45	you all right?
680	00:41:45	00:41:47	Yeah.
681	00:41:47	00:41:50	Since we skipped lunch you want to get something to eat?
682	00:41:50	00:41:51	Walk it off?
683	00:41:51	00:41:54	I got to go home.
684	00:41:55	00:41:57	Thanks. Rain check?
685	00:41:57	00:41:58	Mm-hmm.
686	00:42:37	00:42:39	You got my call.
687	00:42:39	00:42:43	It couldn't have come at a better time.
