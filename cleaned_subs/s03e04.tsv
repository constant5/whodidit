0	00:01:20	00:01:22	Is this some kind of convention?
1	00:01:22	00:01:23	Little people convention.
2	00:01:23	00:01:26	Every year they come from all over the world to a designated city.
3	00:01:26	00:01:27	Socialize, network.
4	00:01:27	00:01:30	It's their prom, Olympics, and New Year's Eve all rolled into one.
5	00:01:31	00:01:32	Oh, hey.
6	00:01:32	00:01:34	Excuse me.
7	00:01:34	00:01:36	Don't think so, square jaw.
8	00:01:36	00:01:38	Grissom, how do you know this?
9	00:01:38	00:01:41	I get the newsletter.
10	00:01:43	00:01:47	Lawrence Ames, clothing salesman from Phoenix.
11	00:01:47	00:01:51	He's 35, four foot, five inches tall.
12	00:01:51	00:01:54	One of the, uh, convention organizers found him.
13	00:01:54	00:01:56	She was checking out the stage.
14	00:01:56	00:01:59	There's a fashion show tomorrow if you're interested.
15	00:01:59	00:02:00	She looked up and saw him.
16	00:02:00	00:02:02	Guy does a suicide in a public place.
17	00:02:02	00:02:03	He was trying to make a statement.
18	00:02:03	00:02:05	Suicide?
19	00:02:05	00:02:06	It's a reasonable suspicion.
20	00:02:06	00:02:11	Suicide among any disability group is above average.
21	00:02:11	00:02:13	Being a dwarf doesn't mean you're disabled, Nick.
22	00:02:13	00:02:14	It means you're... short.
23	00:02:17	00:02:19	I think we've got a little murder.
24	00:02:56	00:02:58	My favorite CSI.
25	00:02:58	00:03:00	I was hoping you'd get the call out.
26	00:03:00	00:03:02	Look who is back in town.
27	00:03:02	00:03:03	So, what happened, Drew?
28	00:03:03	00:03:06	You didn't like, uh, Idaho? Is that it?
29	00:03:06	00:03:07	Had everything but you.
30	00:03:07	00:03:09	Yeah, right.
31	00:03:09	00:03:11	So, what do we got?
32	00:03:11	00:03:12	One body, male Caucasian.
33	00:03:12	00:03:14	Looks like a home invasion.
34	00:03:14	00:03:15	Listen, I'm headed next door.
35	00:03:15	00:03:18	I'm going to talk to a neighbor heard shouting, called 9-1-1.
36	00:03:18	00:03:19	Keep me posted?
37	00:03:19	00:03:21	Always did.
38	00:03:25	00:03:27	Hi.
39	00:03:27	00:03:28	Willows.
40	00:03:28	00:03:30	Akers.
41	00:03:30	00:03:31	You clear the place?
42	00:03:31	00:03:32	Just finishing.
43	00:03:32	00:03:35	Okay.
44	00:03:47	00:03:49	Yeah?
45	00:03:49	00:03:51	Oh, hey, Warrick.
46	00:03:51	00:03:56	Uh, yeah, it's, uh some kind of home invasion gone bad.
47	00:03:56	00:03:57	Don't run any lights.
48	00:03:57	00:04:00	I'll just process till the coroner gets here.
49	00:04:00	00:04:03	Okay. Cool.
50	00:04:03	00:04:08	We were just pulling out of the chili place when dispatch radio, uh arrived on the scene at 1900 hours.
51	00:04:08	00:04:10	My partner secured the perimeter.
52	00:04:10	00:04:11	I've been in here...
53	00:04:11	00:04:13	This your first time on body watch?
54	00:04:13	00:04:15	Well...
55	00:04:15	00:04:18	alive...
56	00:04:18	00:04:20	it's inside your bowels.
57	00:04:20	00:04:21	Dead, it ends up on the floor.
58	00:04:23	00:04:25	Go. Go, go, go. Just get some air.
59	00:05:09	00:05:13	Suspect on location! Suspect on location!
60	00:05:20	00:05:21	Out back.
61	00:05:21	00:05:22	Catherine, what happened?
62	00:05:23	00:05:23	He went out back.
63	00:05:24	00:05:26	I'm all right.
64	00:05:26	00:05:27	I'm okay.
65	00:05:35	00:05:36	He must have gotten out the back window.
66	00:05:40	00:05:43	You the first officer on the scene?
67	00:05:43	00:05:45	When you clear a place you clear it, do you understand?
68	00:05:45	00:05:47	Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
69	00:05:47	00:05:49	We lost a CSI two years ago because of the same mistake!
70	00:05:49	00:05:50	Warrick...
71	00:05:50	00:05:51	ease up.
72	00:05:51	00:05:53	My fault.
73	00:05:53	00:05:54	I sent him out.
74	00:05:54	00:05:58	Use your radio and call for backup.
75	00:06:00	00:06:02	Hey...
76	00:06:02	00:06:04	Hey.
77	00:06:04	00:06:05	Are you okay?
78	00:06:05	00:06:08	Yeah. I'm all right.
79	00:06:09	00:06:11	Don't touch me.
80	00:06:11	00:06:13	I'm evidence.
81	00:06:15	00:06:16	I got some fibers here.
82	00:06:16	00:06:18	Possibly secondary.
83	00:06:18	00:06:24	This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck.
84	00:06:24	00:06:25	Wait, David.
85	00:06:26	00:06:27	Got a hair in the knot.
86	00:06:30	00:06:32	Killer's in the rope.
87	00:06:32	00:06:34	I want to preserve this as is, so cut higher.
88	00:06:34	00:06:35	Yes, sir.
89	00:06:45	00:06:49	Hey, um, hand me a swab, would you?
90	00:06:49	00:06:52	You know I could do this for you.
91	00:06:52	00:06:58	Not going to hurt any less.
92	00:07:02	00:07:03	That cut is deep.
93	00:07:07	00:07:10	Damn.
94	00:07:12	00:07:16	All right, um, hey, uh, turn around.
95	00:07:16	00:07:17	Huh?
96	00:07:17	00:07:20	Privacy.
97	00:07:20	00:07:21	The guy bodied me full-on.
98	00:07:22	00:07:24	I don't want Trace to miss one hair or one fiber.
99	00:07:38	00:07:41	You decent?
100	00:07:50	00:07:54	Looks like we're up.
101	00:08:14	00:08:16	These scars are old.
102	00:08:17	00:08:19	Tell me this wasn't bone-lengthening surgery.
103	00:08:19	00:08:22	Probably done when he was a teenager.
104	00:08:22	00:08:26	Surgical pins are inserted into the bone and linked to an external screw.
105	00:08:26	00:08:28	Turn the screw, it cracks the bones.
106	00:08:28	00:08:30	Osteogenic cells flood in.
107	00:08:30	00:08:32	Callus forms to bridge the gap.
108	00:08:32	00:08:36	The fractures heal and the bone gets longer.
109	00:08:36	00:08:41	You have to break the bones every four to six hours a quarter millimeter at a time.
110	00:08:41	00:08:44	Excruciating pain...
111	00:08:44	00:08:46	for an extra few inches.
112	00:08:46	00:08:49	What people will endure to be normal.
113	00:08:49	00:08:51	What fools these mortals be.
114	00:08:51	00:08:52	Hmm.
115	00:08:53	00:08:55	So, hanging?
116	00:08:55	00:08:56	At least.
117	00:08:56	00:09:00	COD was asphyxiation due to strangulation.
118	00:09:00	00:09:03	Give me a hand here.
119	00:09:03	00:09:08	Bruise behind the ear is characteristic of a hanging.
120	00:09:08	00:09:10	This bruise is not.
121	00:09:10	00:09:12	What is that, blunt force?
122	00:09:12	00:09:15	Take a look at this.
123	00:09:16	00:09:21	Separation of the first and second vertebrae prior to death.
124	00:09:21	00:09:23	He was paralyzed?
125	00:09:23	00:09:28	That's something that would only happen to a dwarf with pseudoachondroplasia.
126	00:09:28	00:09:32	Physiology can make for cervical spine instability.
127	00:09:32	00:09:35	So it's possible that whoever did this knew something about dwarf anatomy.
128	00:09:59	00:10:00	Suspect on location!
129	00:10:02	00:10:04	He was drinking.
130	00:10:06	00:10:08	It was beer.
131	00:10:10	00:10:12	I'll go process the back.
132	00:10:47	00:10:49	Denim fiber from the cabinet.
133	00:10:49	00:10:51	Could be nothing.
134	00:10:51	00:10:57	And lots of smudges but no prints worthwhile.
135	00:10:57	00:11:01	Yeah, I didn't get any prints either but I did get a partial shoe tread from the back gate.
136	00:11:02	00:11:07	And I don't think our dead guy lived here.
137	00:11:07	00:11:10	Based on...?
138	00:11:10	00:11:11	These pictures.
139	00:11:11	00:11:18	Got Detective Wolf looking for the homeowner's name from the real estate records.
140	00:11:18	00:11:21	So, our home invasion robbery may be not a home invasion after all.
141	00:11:24	00:11:26	So, would you mind if we tape-lifted your shirt?
142	00:11:27	00:11:28	Comb your hair for evidence?
143	00:11:28	00:11:29	Evidence of what?
144	00:11:29	00:11:34	Well, the first person at a crime scene often turns out to be a viable suspect.
145	00:11:34	00:11:36	I'm the one that found his body.
146	00:11:36	00:11:38	I'm the one that called it in.
147	00:11:38	00:11:41	If you're innocent it'll rule you out.
148	00:11:41	00:11:42	Go ahead.
149	00:11:47	00:11:50	Does he ever talk?
150	00:11:50	00:11:51	Yeah.
151	00:11:52	00:11:53	At, uh, random intervals.
152	00:11:53	00:11:56	I was admiring your reaching tool.
153	00:11:56	00:11:58	I have one I use to wipe my tush with.
154	00:11:59	00:12:01	Would you like to take a look at that, too?
155	00:12:02	00:12:07	Hey, if the world doesn't adapt itself to you you have to adapt yourself to it, right?
156	00:12:07	00:12:09	Yeah.
157	00:12:09	00:12:12	You know, you probably think I'm cold.
158	00:12:12	00:12:16	Pulling slots after I found Lawrence up there.
159	00:12:16	00:12:18	This is the convention.
160	00:12:18	00:12:19	Everything moves at warp speed.
161	00:12:19	00:12:23	I'm done. Thank you.
162	00:12:30	00:12:34	You know, 51 weeks in your hometown with nothing but average-sized people.
163	00:12:34	00:12:36	I have to fit a lifetime into this week.
164	00:12:36	00:12:39	We all do.
165	00:12:39	00:12:40	Business connections, gambling, romance.
166	00:12:41	00:12:42	Excuse me.
167	00:12:42	00:12:45	Did Lawrence have any problems in those areas?
168	00:12:45	00:12:46	Romance? Not at all.
169	00:12:46	00:12:48	Lawrence was a pseudo.
170	00:12:48	00:12:51	He could have his pick of any girl in here.
171	00:12:53	00:12:55	What's a pseudo?
172	00:12:55	00:13:00	Dwarfs with pseudoachondroplasia have features and head size like normal people.
173	00:13:00	00:13:05	Dwarfs with achondroplasia have shortened limbs and enlarged heads.
174	00:13:05	00:13:08	Different types of dwarfs, different social status?
175	00:13:08	00:13:12	Hey... discrimination isn't just for tall people.
176	00:13:26	00:13:28	Excuse me.
177	00:13:30	00:13:32	Isn't this, uh, Lawrence Ames's room?
178	00:13:32	00:13:34	Yes.
179	00:13:34	00:13:36	Who are you?
180	00:13:42	00:13:44	I'm his fiancee.
181	00:13:48	00:13:50	We always got those looks.
182	00:13:50	00:13:53	I'm five-seven, in case you were wondering.
183	00:13:53	00:13:56	Our concern isn't your height; it's your proximity.
184	00:13:56	00:13:59	You're standing in a potential crime scene.
185	00:14:00	00:14:03	Would you please sit down here?
186	00:14:03	00:14:07	We want to keep the contamination to a minimum.
187	00:14:07	00:14:09	This is CSI Sidle.
188	00:14:09	00:14:12	We need a uniform in room 312 right away.
189	00:14:12	00:14:14	Thanks.
190	00:14:16	00:14:19	Didn't the police tell you not to come in here?
191	00:14:19	00:14:20	Yes.
192	00:14:20	00:14:23	But I wanted to be near Lawrence's things.
193	00:14:23	00:14:27	And, um... these are Lawrence's things?
194	00:14:28	00:14:29	Yes.
195	00:14:42	00:14:43	Sara?
196	00:14:43	00:14:46	Yeah?
197	00:14:53	00:14:56	Gouge is deeper at the bottom than the top.
198	00:14:56	00:14:59	So the strike was made coming down.
199	00:15:17	00:15:19	Grissom.
200	00:15:24	00:15:28	Did you and Mr. Ames have an argument, say last night?
201	00:15:28	00:15:29	No.
202	00:15:32	00:15:35	You don't believe me?
203	00:15:35	00:15:39	Well, right now, we believe the evidence.
204	00:15:42	00:15:46	What are the marks on his forearms?
205	00:15:46	00:15:47	Hmm, can't say.
206	00:15:47	00:15:52	But I do know that Teddy Henders died from blunt force trauma.
207	00:15:52	00:15:53	From what, do you think?
208	00:15:53	00:15:55	A hammer, butt of a gun?
209	00:15:55	00:15:57	I was just going to see if I could figure that out.
210	00:16:15	00:16:18	Z?
211	00:16:19	00:16:25	There was a Z-Mover video game on the floor next to the vic.
212	00:16:26	00:16:28	Murder by Z-Mover.
213	00:16:28	00:16:30	The neighbors heard shouting.
214	00:16:30	00:16:35	Two guys break and enter and get into some kind of an alternation.
215	00:16:41	00:16:43	One ends up killing the other.
216	00:16:43	00:16:45	And almost Catherine.
217	00:16:47	00:16:49	That had to be scary, huh?
218	00:16:49	00:16:52	I didn't have time to be scared, David.
219	00:16:52	00:16:54	Oh.
220	00:17:09	00:17:12	Is the lipstick on this champagne glass yours?
221	00:17:12	00:17:14	No champagne for me.
222	00:17:14	00:17:16	I'm pregnant.
223	00:17:16	00:17:18	Only seven weeks.
224	00:17:18	00:17:21	Is this your computer, or Lawrence's?
225	00:17:21	00:17:23	Lawrence's.
226	00:17:23	00:17:26	We're going to have to take it with us.
227	00:17:32	00:17:33	Cath?
228	00:17:33	00:17:35	You all right?
229	00:17:37	00:17:40	Don't let him get to you like that.
230	00:17:40	00:17:42	I was scared...
231	00:17:43	00:17:45	and I still am.
232	00:17:45	00:17:48	Don't tell anybody.
233	00:17:51	00:17:52	Hey, Greg.
234	00:17:52	00:17:53	Hey.
235	00:17:54	00:17:55	Get anything off the rope?
236	00:17:55	00:17:58	Yeah, a few brown hairs around the knot.
237	00:17:58	00:18:00	Only one with a skin tag, though.
238	00:18:00	00:18:03	And those fibers that Sara found on the body?
239	00:18:03	00:18:03	Yeah?
240	00:18:03	00:18:04	Polyester upholstery.
241	00:18:05	00:18:07	Cheap rugs and tacky furniture.
242	00:18:07	00:18:08	I need these hairs.
243	00:18:09	00:18:10	Uh, uh, no DNA tags on those.
244	00:18:10	00:18:12	Doesn't matter.
245	00:18:13	00:18:15	You know, I hate it when he does that.
246	00:18:15	00:18:17	I like to make a presentation, you know?
247	00:18:17	00:18:18	So, present.
248	00:18:18	00:18:19	Eh, forget it.
249	00:18:20	00:18:21	Scope's interesting.
250	00:18:25	00:18:28	All right, fresh epithelials.
251	00:18:28	00:18:31	Yeah, I found them on the rope near the anchor point.
252	00:18:31	00:18:32	A minuscule sample, but useable.
253	00:18:32	00:18:34	How long for DNA?
254	00:18:35	00:18:36	Well, give me something to compare it to.
255	00:18:36	00:18:38	Get me the fiancee's blood.
256	00:18:38	00:18:40	Well, I can't just give you her blood.
257	00:18:40	00:18:41	That takes a court order.
258	00:18:41	00:18:44	I'm open 24 hours.
259	00:18:48	00:18:51	Met you in a pseudo chat room.
260	00:18:51	00:18:52	Do you remember me?
261	00:18:52	00:18:55	I remember you.
262	00:18:58	00:19:00	...to the convention this year?
263	00:19:00	00:19:01	I'd love to meet you.
264	00:19:01	00:19:03	See if you can pick me out.
265	00:19:03	00:19:09	Perfect face perfect body.
266	00:19:09	00:19:11	Count of three, handsome.
267	00:19:19	00:19:24	Jessica, you knew Lawrence was having an on-line affair with another woman didn't you?
268	00:19:24	00:19:27	You logged on at times when Lawrence was at work.
269	00:19:27	00:19:28	We checked his work records.
270	00:19:29	00:19:31	A lot of girls liked Lawrence.
271	00:19:31	00:19:33	He was funny and smart and sweet.
272	00:19:33	00:19:34	Danielle was different.
273	00:19:34	00:19:37	She was his size.
274	00:19:37	00:19:40	She was... perfect.
275	00:19:40	00:19:42	We found your skin cells on the rope that hung Lawrence.
276	00:19:42	00:19:45	You're making that up.
277	00:19:45	00:19:46	No, I'm not.
278	00:19:46	00:19:48	Our court order your blood.
279	00:19:48	00:19:51	I did not put a noose around my fiancÃ©'s neck.
280	00:19:51	00:19:53	Then explain how your skin cells got on the rope.
281	00:19:53	00:19:55	I can't.
282	00:20:13	00:20:16	Hey.
283	00:20:16	00:20:18	Confronted the fiancee; she stonewalled us.
284	00:20:18	00:20:20	Brass told her not to leave town.
285	00:20:20	00:20:23	He sounded a bit like Jack Lord, don't you think?
286	00:20:23	00:20:24	Well, she can go wherever she wants to.
287	00:20:24	00:20:25	She didn't do it.
288	00:20:26	00:20:27	Take a look.
289	00:20:27	00:20:30	Hair from the knot.
290	00:20:37	00:20:38	They look thin.
291	00:20:39	00:20:41	Diameter's 60% less than normal.
292	00:20:41	00:20:44	Tensile strength is also way below normal.
293	00:20:44	00:20:45	You have a cross section?
294	00:20:45	00:20:47	Mm-hmm.
295	00:20:50	00:20:52	Hmm. No pigment at the central core.
296	00:20:53	00:20:55	No color.
297	00:20:55	00:20:58	Cartilage hair hypoplasia.
298	00:20:58	00:21:00	C.H.H.
299	00:21:00	00:21:02	It's characterized by fine, brittle body hair.
300	00:21:02	00:21:04	It's an extremely rare syndrome.
301	00:21:04	00:21:05	It's a form of dwarfism.
302	00:21:06	00:21:07	Okay.
303	00:21:07	00:21:08	So, back to the midgets.
304	00:21:08	00:21:12	Nick... dwarfs or little people.
305	00:21:12	00:21:14	You'll need to know what to look for.
306	00:21:14	00:21:16	So, I'll put together a list of C.H.H. attributes.
307	00:21:16	00:21:18	Well, you better do it fast.
308	00:21:18	00:21:21	The convention's over in two days.
309	00:21:21	00:21:25	After that, the little people go home and we lose all our suspects.
310	00:21:41	00:21:42	Ms. Grace?
311	00:21:43	00:21:45	Excuse me.
312	00:21:45	00:21:47	I need your help.
313	00:21:47	00:21:49	What now? My DNA?
314	00:21:49	00:21:51	No, actually... your eyes.
315	00:21:55	00:22:00	I'm sorry, I don't recognize her and a girl this pretty I would remember.
316	00:22:00	00:22:02	The guys would still be drooling.
317	00:22:02	00:22:08	Well, according to the police there's no one named Danielle registered at the hotel or at the convention.
318	00:22:08	00:22:11	You expected an Internet handle to be a real name?
319	00:22:11	00:22:14	Maybe the girl got cold feet.
320	00:22:14	00:22:21	My first IOLP convention-- I walk in, see 200 dwarfs staring back at me and what goes through my head?
321	00:22:21	00:22:24	There's no way I look like these people.
322	00:22:24	00:22:26	I ran.
323	00:22:26	00:22:27	But you went back.
324	00:22:27	00:22:28	Eventually.
325	00:22:28	00:22:33	I guess I realized it's nice to see eye-to-eye with someone.
326	00:22:33	00:22:36	Mm.
327	00:22:36	00:22:39	I get the impression that's a little tough for you.
328	00:22:41	00:22:51	The freaks have looked at her in a secret way and tried to connect their eyes with hers as though to say, 'We know who you are.
329	00:22:51	00:22:55	We are you.' Faulkner.
330	00:22:55	00:22:56	Close.
331	00:22:56	00:22:59	Another southern writer. Carson McCullers.
332	00:22:59	00:23:04	I think we look for the differences in each other to prove that we're not alone.
333	00:23:06	00:23:08	What's yours?
334	00:23:08	00:23:09	Your difference?
335	00:23:11	00:23:13	Mine's the worst.
336	00:23:13	00:23:14	Random gene.
337	00:23:14	00:23:16	Anyone can have a dwarf.
338	00:23:16	00:23:22	Sometimes I've even seen terror in average-size people's eyes.
339	00:23:22	00:23:28	I remind them that their little carbon copies might not be such a copy after all.
340	00:23:30	00:23:39	Well, mine's genetic progressive and impossible to predict.
341	00:23:39	00:23:41	And hard to notice...
342	00:23:41	00:23:43	unless you tell someone.
343	00:23:47	00:23:48	Got your beep.
344	00:23:48	00:23:49	What'd you get?
345	00:23:49	00:23:51	Denim fibers at 400x.
346	00:23:53	00:23:59	The skin from the dead guy and the denim found in the cabinet were both coated in the same substance.
347	00:23:59	00:24:01	You get a breakdown?
348	00:24:01	00:24:06	Yeah, partially hydrogenated soy bean oil traces of beef fat, sugar and potato starch.
349	00:24:06	00:24:09	Cooking grease.
350	00:24:09	00:24:11	That would explain the marks on the guy's forearms.
351	00:24:11	00:24:12	Grease burns.
352	00:24:16	00:24:19	So there's a good chance the victim worked in a fast food joint.
353	00:24:19	00:24:21	I got a feeling they both did.
354	00:24:21	00:24:25	The owner of the house has a franchise of fast food places.
355	00:24:25	00:24:27	Uh, Fast and Fresh Burgers.
356	00:24:27	00:24:29	I just got off the phone with him from Hawaii.
357	00:24:29	00:24:31	Alvin Jackson.
358	00:24:31	00:24:32	Three stores in the Vegas area.
359	00:24:32	00:24:35	And he's on his yearly vacation.
360	00:24:35	00:24:37	Something his employees would definitely know.
361	00:24:39	00:24:40	Get any addresses?
362	00:24:40	00:24:41	You bet.
363	00:24:41	00:24:43	Let's go check it out.
364	00:24:45	00:24:49	We're looking for anything in the picture that might give us a way to find her.
365	00:24:49	00:24:53	Something in the background that determines location a useful reflection, anything.
366	00:24:53	00:24:55	Huh...
367	00:24:55	00:24:56	Oh, I get it.
368	00:24:56	00:24:58	This is like a test, right?
369	00:24:58	00:24:59	What do you mean?
370	00:24:59	00:25:04	Individual hair shadows are amorphous when they should be distinct.
371	00:25:04	00:25:12	In these two areas-- here and here-- they're on the same focal plane but this one's sharp and this one's fuzzy.
372	00:25:13	00:25:14	This picture's a fake?
373	00:25:14	00:25:15	A composite.
374	00:25:16	00:25:17	A very good one.
375	00:25:20	00:25:22	This explains why nobody ever saw her.
376	00:25:22	00:25:23	She only exists in pixels.
377	00:25:26	00:25:27	Nat King Cole.
378	00:25:27	00:25:29	Excuse me?
379	00:25:29	00:25:32	Archie would you separate the composite elements, please?
380	00:25:32	00:25:33	Yup.
381	00:25:39	00:25:41	The image was built out of these.
382	00:25:41	00:25:46	Now if you could, pull up a photo of the victim, grey scale.
383	00:25:51	00:25:58	There's a theory in art that the Mona Lisa was really a feminized version of Leonardo da Vinci himself.
384	00:25:58	00:26:01	Concept suggests... deep down we're all narcissists?
385	00:26:01	00:26:02	Yeah.
386	00:26:02	00:26:05	What attracts us the most is ourselves.
387	00:26:07	00:26:09	Scale to match the original picture with Danielle.
388	00:26:29	00:26:34	Danielle is a virtual woman created to attract and lure Lawrence Ames...
389	00:26:34	00:26:35	away from his fiancee, maybe?
390	00:26:35	00:26:38	Boy, do I have good timing, or what?
391	00:26:39	00:26:41	I did a little checking with the phone company.
392	00:26:41	00:26:46	In the past year, Lawrence Ames received over 200 calls from Melanie Grace.
393	00:26:46	00:26:47	The same woman that found him dead.
394	00:26:48	00:26:51	He got call-blocking against her two months ago.
395	00:26:51	00:26:52	Well, that's interesting.
396	00:26:52	00:26:55	That's the same time Danielle started sending him instant messages.
397	00:26:57	00:26:58	Yes, I called Lawrence.
398	00:26:58	00:26:59	We met in a chat room.
399	00:27:00	00:27:01	He also called me.
400	00:27:01	00:27:02	Did you look at my phone records?
401	00:27:02	00:27:04	He eventually blocked your calls.
402	00:27:04	00:27:07	The same week he got engaged to Jessica Marcus.
403	00:27:07	00:27:14	It was at that time he began receiving messages from... a perfect woman...
404	00:27:18	00:27:19	...who doesn't really exist.
405	00:27:21	00:27:22	You think that I would do that?
406	00:27:22	00:27:27	Present myself to a man as anything other than who I am?
407	00:27:27	00:27:29	If it would break up his new engagement.
408	00:27:31	00:27:32	So what happened?
409	00:27:32	00:27:38	You went to the convention you saw him with his tall girlfriend and you go to Plan B?
410	00:27:43	00:27:45	You think I'm capable of that?
411	00:27:45	00:27:50	Killing because a woman has some height on me?
412	00:27:50	00:27:53	Pretending to be an ideal...
413	00:27:53	00:27:57	If you think that...
414	00:27:57	00:27:59	then I was wrong about you.
415	00:28:17	00:28:18	Hey.
416	00:28:18	00:28:19	Do you mind, little man?
417	00:28:19	00:28:20	I'm trying to work here.
418	00:28:20	00:28:21	Really? Yeah.
419	00:28:22	00:28:24	You making any progress, CSI man?
420	00:28:26	00:28:27	Some. Uh-huh.
421	00:28:27	00:28:29	Are we getting your A-game or your B-game?
422	00:28:29	00:28:30	Come again?
423	00:28:30	00:28:35	You see us little people we're used to getting the short end of the stick.
424	00:28:36	00:28:38	You don't get to laugh at that.
425	00:28:47	00:28:52	What I want to know is are you treating this like a case or like a joke?
426	00:28:53	00:28:55	Well, a man was killed; that's no joke.
427	00:28:58	00:29:01	You got my A-game.
428	00:29:01	00:29:02	Yeah?
429	00:29:03	00:29:05	Yeah.
430	00:29:05	00:29:07	Carry on.
431	00:29:30	00:29:31	Uh, Grissom.
432	00:29:31	00:29:34	There's, uh, something weird going on with the hairs from the ropes.
433	00:29:34	00:29:36	Well, not weird.
434	00:29:36	00:29:39	More like... hair-raising.
435	00:29:40	00:29:41	Sorry, bad one.
436	00:29:42	00:29:48	Um, okay, at first I thought that maybe I was doing something wrong-- running too many DNA samples, you know seeing things.
437	00:29:48	00:29:50	Greg?
438	00:29:51	00:29:56	Uh, the dwarf hair has seven alleles in common with Jessica Marcus's skin cells.
439	00:29:58	00:29:59	The two donors are related.
440	00:29:59	00:30:01	Profiles say so.
441	00:30:06	00:30:07	Grissom.
442	00:30:07	00:30:09	He looked like he fit your profile.
443	00:30:09	00:30:10	So, I asked around.
444	00:30:10	00:30:13	Two little people confirmed he has C.H.H.
445	00:30:13	00:30:15	Okay, thank you.
446	00:30:15	00:30:16	Yeah.
447	00:30:22	00:30:24	Kevin Marcus?
448	00:30:25	00:30:26	Buying or browsing?
449	00:30:27	00:30:28	Maybe a little bit of both.
450	00:30:28	00:30:31	Rope for makeshift banisters, huh?
451	00:30:31	00:30:32	That rag rope... cuts the hands.
452	00:30:33	00:30:34	Now you feel this nylon.
453	00:30:34	00:30:37	Go ahead feel that.
454	00:30:37	00:30:42	I do trade shows mail order...
455	00:30:42	00:30:44	I even sold to this convention.
456	00:30:44	00:30:48	So what do you, buy from wholesalers and then repackage in your home?
457	00:30:48	00:30:50	Yeah, Chicago.
458	00:30:50	00:30:55	Well, that explains how your daughter's skin cells got all over the rope that hung Lawrence Ames.
459	00:30:55	00:30:57	Your daughter's name is Jessica, right?
460	00:30:57	00:31:01	The lab also found your hair all over that rope.
461	00:31:01	00:31:03	Well, I touch all the merchandise.
462	00:31:03	00:31:04	Nice try, Kev.
463	00:31:04	00:31:07	They hair was caught in the noose.
464	00:31:10	00:31:13	Did you know your father killed Lawrence?
465	00:31:13	00:31:18	That's what they told me but I couldn't believe it.
466	00:31:18	00:31:21	I still can't.
467	00:31:21	00:31:25	So you created Danielle to break up your daughter's engagement.
468	00:31:25	00:31:27	That's an interesting theory.
469	00:31:29	00:31:31	What?
470	00:31:31	00:31:35	You guys trace an online account to my credit card or something like that?
471	00:31:35	00:31:37	Oh, no, wait.
472	00:31:37	00:31:39	Um, I use a free ISP.
473	00:31:39	00:31:45	That means no name, no trail, no case.
474	00:31:47	00:31:51	Mr. Marcus, in your business you deal with proportions, correct?
475	00:31:51	00:31:57	You provide little people with what they need to compensate for their proportions and to live with them.
476	00:31:58	00:32:03	You know what little people aspire to be.
477	00:32:03	00:32:07	Your, uh, logo is interesting.
478	00:32:07	00:32:10	Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.
479	00:32:12	00:32:16	In the perfect human form, arm span equals height.
480	00:32:18	00:32:25	You're very aware of what, uh people are looking for in a mate aren't you?
481	00:32:25	00:32:31	The night before he died, Lawrence and I had a fight about Danielle.
482	00:32:31	00:32:33	Are still in contact with her?
483	00:32:33	00:32:35	She e-mails or IM's.
484	00:32:35	00:32:37	I don't answer. I love you.
485	00:32:37	00:32:39	You're lying. You're cheating on me!
486	00:32:42	00:32:48	And I ran out of the house and I went to my dad.
487	00:32:48	00:33:00	I was crying and he told me to leave Lawrence but I couldn't because... I... I loved him.
488	00:33:00	00:33:03	I'm having our baby.
489	00:33:03	00:33:07	And I went back to our room and we made up.
490	00:33:10	00:33:14	And the next night...
491	00:33:14	00:33:18	he said he was going out to meet a friend.
492	00:33:25	00:33:26	I'll be back in an hour.
493	00:33:29	00:33:31	And he never came back.
494	00:33:33	00:33:35	So, what'd you have against the guy?
495	00:33:35	00:33:36	What are you, blind?
496	00:33:36	00:33:39	He was a dwarf.
497	00:33:39	00:33:44	My wife and I our daughter-- a genetic miracle.
498	00:33:44	00:33:47	One-in-four shot she'd be an average.
499	00:33:47	00:33:49	And she was a beautiful average.
500	00:33:49	00:33:51	So your wife is also a dwarf.
501	00:33:51	00:33:53	Yeah.
502	00:33:53	00:33:57	Jessica didn't have to fight the world every day, like we did.
503	00:33:57	00:33:59	We freed her from all that.
504	00:33:59	00:34:04	But that little bastard kept dragging her right back down into it.
505	00:34:04	00:34:05	So you killed him.
506	00:34:05	00:34:07	I said I didn't like the guy.
507	00:34:07	00:34:09	I didn't kill anybody.
508	00:34:15	00:34:17	Can we prove it?
509	00:34:17	00:34:18	Not yet.
510	00:34:18	00:34:22	The rope was anchored to the lighting truss which was at least five feet over his head.
511	00:34:22	00:34:23	So?
512	00:34:23	00:34:25	He can barely lift his arms above his shoulders.
513	00:34:25	00:34:30	He suffers from lumbar lordosis swayback...
514	00:34:30	00:34:33	which is typical of C.H.H.
515	00:34:33	00:34:35	and it limits his mobility even more.
516	00:34:35	00:34:38	Hey, the guy put a rope around the victim's neck.
517	00:34:38	00:34:41	Yeah, but how did he hang him?
518	00:34:49	00:34:53	Listen, Catherine me and Warrick can handle this.
519	00:34:55	00:34:56	I'm going in.
520	00:34:56	00:34:57	Well, the guy assaulted you.
521	00:34:57	00:35:00	You don't have to put yourself through this, you know.
522	00:35:00	00:35:02	I don't, I'll be scared of the next guy and the one after that.
523	00:35:08	00:35:11	Shoe tread, denim fiber, a lot of cooking grease.
524	00:35:11	00:35:14	Based on that evidence, they all did it.
525	00:35:14	00:35:18	All right, so we take them one by one.
526	00:35:18	00:35:20	Transfer works both ways.
527	00:35:25	00:35:26	Warrick?
528	00:35:30	00:35:31	Blow your nose.
529	00:35:32	00:35:33	I don't gotta.
530	00:35:49	00:35:50	Guess.
531	00:36:03	00:36:04	I don't think so.
532	00:36:04	00:36:09	Then I guess I'll just have to look for myself.
533	00:36:09	00:36:11	You want to look at my boogers, lady, go ahead.
534	00:36:11	00:36:12	Hey!
535	00:36:24	00:36:28	Nose hairs... are nature's filter.
536	00:36:28	00:36:31	Traps all kinds of things.
537	00:36:31	00:36:35	Dust, dirt...
538	00:36:36	00:36:38	...fingerprint powder.
539	00:36:40	00:36:41	You did it.
540	00:36:44	00:36:48	You inhaled the fingerprint dust I was using.
541	00:36:48	00:36:55	We went up there to party 'cause the boss was out of town and I saw the Z-Mover first but Teddy... Teddy...
542	00:36:56	00:36:59	I saw it first.
543	00:36:59	00:37:00	I saw it first.
544	00:37:00	00:37:02	It's mine.
545	00:37:02	00:37:03	I saw it first. I called it.
546	00:37:03	00:37:04	You want it, you bastard?!
547	00:37:05	00:37:06	I didn't mean to kill him.
548	00:37:06	00:37:07	It was an accident.
549	00:37:07	00:37:09	I mean, I...
550	00:37:09	00:37:10	Get up.
551	00:37:10	00:37:12	I didn't mean...
552	00:37:19	00:37:20	You all right?
553	00:37:20	00:37:23	Yeah.
554	00:37:23	00:37:26	Hey, did you get anything else off that laptop?
555	00:37:26	00:37:28	No, a bunch of the files were corrupted.
556	00:37:28	00:37:30	Archie's taking another run at them.
557	00:37:40	00:37:43	Victim was paralyzed, couldn't fight back.
558	00:37:43	00:37:48	Kevin Marcus puts the rope around his neck makes a slip knot.
559	00:37:48	00:37:53	And ties off the other end on the truss even though there is no way he could have reached it.
560	00:37:53	00:37:55	No way he could've reached it.
561	00:38:10	00:38:13	Nick, what are you doing?
562	00:38:13	00:38:17	Changing my perspective.
563	00:38:17	00:38:19	Oh, man.
564	00:38:19	00:38:22	Can you imagine going through life at this height?
565	00:38:22	00:38:24	They do okay.
566	00:38:24	00:38:27	If the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you...
567	00:38:27	00:38:30	...Adapt yourself to it.
568	00:38:39	00:38:41	Where's Grissom?
569	00:39:08	00:39:09	Grissom?
570	00:39:11	00:39:13	We know how he did it.
571	00:39:13	00:39:17	Your wheelchair was in the booth at the convention.
572	00:39:17	00:39:23	The fibers from the seat cover to your wheelchair match the fibers we found on the victim.
573	00:39:23	00:39:26	Uh, faux, fake sheepskin.
574	00:39:28	00:39:33	We also know how you got Mr. Ames into the theater.
575	00:39:33	00:39:41	Our lab retrieved a final instant message to Lawrence from Danielle.
576	00:39:46	00:39:49	Mr. Marcus, what are you doing here?
577	00:39:51	00:39:54	It's enough to convict you.
578	00:39:55	00:39:57	May I ask a question?
579	00:39:57	00:40:00	How did you get him into the wheelchair?
580	00:40:02	00:40:06	Well... I appealed to his vanity.
581	00:40:07	00:40:12	I told him I needed a brochure model to sell my new chair.
582	00:40:12	00:40:15	You don't want me near your daughter but you want me to hawk your chairs?
583	00:40:15	00:40:18	I never said you weren't handsome.
584	00:40:18	00:40:24	I mean, come on-- your face, your build-- a million chairs, Sold.
585	00:40:24	00:40:26	Great, come on.
586	00:40:26	00:40:28	Hop in.
587	00:40:28	00:40:30	Hop in, let me see you in there.
588	00:40:30	00:40:31	Come on.
589	00:40:31	00:40:33	Model for me.
590	00:40:34	00:40:36	There you go.
591	00:40:36	00:40:39	Wait, let me make an adjustment for you, here.
592	00:40:41	00:40:42	I paralyzed him.
593	00:40:57	00:40:59	I couldn't let Jessica marry him.
594	00:41:02	00:41:04	Any kid they have...
595	00:41:04	00:41:07	a 50% chance it would be a dwarf.
596	00:41:07	00:41:10	You have to understand that.
597	00:41:17	00:41:18	It's genetics.
598	00:41:21	00:41:24	Mr. Marcus, I think you should know...
599	00:41:24	00:41:29	your daughter is already pregnant by Lawrence Ames.
600	00:41:55	00:41:57	You know what's really sad?
601	00:41:57	00:41:59	This wasn't just a murder.
602	00:41:59	00:42:01	It was a hate crime.
603	00:42:01	00:42:04	Kevin Marcus hated himself.
604	00:42:33	00:42:35	Dr. Grissom, welcome back.
605	00:42:49	00:42:51	Take care of yourself.
