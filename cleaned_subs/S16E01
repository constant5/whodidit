1,00:00:10,00:00:11,(man whispers indistinctly)
2,00:00:40,00:00:42,(blipping)
3,00:00:52,00:00:53,"CROUPIER: Okay, folks."
4,00:00:53,00:00:54,Ball is on the wheel.
5,00:00:54,00:00:56,This is the last call for betting.
6,00:00:56,00:00:58,(indistinct chatter)
7,00:01:07,00:01:09,CROUPIER: We have a winner!
8,00:01:09,00:01:10,BRASS: Are you getting this?
9,00:01:10,00:01:11,Huh?
10,00:01:11,00:01:16,"Blue plaid shirt, past posting chocolate chips at table R49?"
11,00:01:16,00:01:16,We gotta shut him down.
12,00:01:16,00:01:21,"CROUPIER: Round and round she goes, where she stops, nobody knows."
13,00:01:21,00:01:24,"(wheel clicking, blipping)"
14,00:01:36,00:01:40,"Sir, can I help you?"
15,00:01:40,00:01:40,"Sorry, yes."
16,00:01:40,00:01:42,You can help me.
17,00:01:44,00:01:47,You have change for a penny?
18,00:02:03,00:02:05,(gasps)
19,00:02:05,00:02:07,(explosion thunders)
20,00:02:10,00:02:12,"(people screaming, clamoring)"
21,00:02:21,00:02:22,"This is Federal, sir."
22,00:02:22,00:02:24,It's a bomb.
23,00:02:24,00:02:27,"I know it's not my jurisdiction, but it is my casino."
24,00:02:27,00:02:30,I'm on the next plane.
25,00:02:30,00:02:33,(reporter speaking indistinctly)
26,00:02:33,00:02:35,"(sirens wailing, horns blaring)"
27,00:02:47,00:02:48,SIDLE: Hey.
28,00:02:48,00:02:49,"Oh, great."
29,00:02:49,00:02:52,"All right, all hands on deck on this one."
30,00:02:52,00:02:55,Blast circumference roughly 18 by 12.
31,00:02:55,00:02:57,We got three dead and several dozen injured.
32,00:02:57,00:02:59,"So, let's-let's get on it."
33,00:02:59,00:03:01,"All right, I'll look for bomb parts."
34,00:03:01,00:03:02,I'll shoot the overalls.
35,00:03:02,00:03:05,Henry and I will document the detonation blast area.
36,00:03:05,00:03:07,"I'll measure, you photo."
37,00:03:07,00:03:10,"So, uh, I know you're applying for the directorship."
38,00:03:10,00:03:13,"Oh. Stage doesn't get any bigger than this, Sara."
39,00:03:13,00:03:15,You want this case?
40,00:03:16,00:03:17,Good.
41,00:03:17,00:03:19,It's yours.
42,00:03:21,00:03:28,"I know this is gonna sound insensitive, but don't you think a bomber wearing a vest would've taken out way more people than this?"
43,00:03:28,00:03:29,Yeah.
44,00:03:29,00:03:32,"So, what, faulty bomb?"
45,00:03:32,00:03:39,"You put a vest on like that in a public place, I gotta think that you're planning on taking as many people with you as possible."
46,00:03:39,00:03:41,Yeah.
47,00:03:41,00:03:42,"So, what do you think?"
48,00:03:42,00:03:43,First blush.
49,00:03:46,00:03:48,Terrorism.
50,00:03:48,00:03:50,Why do you say that?
51,00:03:50,00:03:52,Vegas is terrified.
52,00:03:54,00:03:56,OFFICER (whispering): Let's go to the bow.
53,00:04:25,00:04:26,Sir?
54,00:04:26,00:04:27,Harbor Patrol.
55,00:04:27,00:04:29,I'm Officer Scinta.
56,00:04:29,00:04:32,These men are from San Diego PD.
57,00:04:32,00:04:34,I have orders to remove all trespassers.
58,00:04:34,00:04:36,Please show me your hands.
59,00:04:38,00:04:45,"I'm gonna give you about two seconds to turn around, or I'm gonna consider you a threat and shoot you right here on this boat."
60,00:04:46,00:04:49,(sighs)
61,00:04:49,00:04:51,Shark fins.
62,00:04:51,00:04:54,Looks like somebody jumped a shark.
63,00:04:56,00:04:58,"(siren wailing, horn blaring)"
64,00:04:58,00:05:01,(siren approaches)
65,00:05:05,00:05:06,"Well, you got here fast."
66,00:05:06,00:05:08,WILLOWS: FBI has its perks.
67,00:05:08,00:05:09,How many dead?
68,00:05:09,00:05:11,Three. A lot are injured.
69,00:05:11,00:05:13,We don't have a count.
70,00:05:13,00:05:14,"Anyway, she's one of ours."
71,00:05:14,00:05:16,Her name is Romina Gonzalez.
72,00:05:16,00:05:17,I saw the surveillance video.
73,00:05:17,00:05:18,You want to talk to her now.
74,00:05:18,00:05:22,She was the last person to speak to the bomber before he self-detonated.
75,00:05:22,00:05:23,"Romina, hang in there, honey."
76,00:05:23,00:05:27,"WILLOWS: Mrs. Gonzalez, I'm Catherine Willows, Special Agent with the FBI."
77,00:05:27,00:05:28,(groans in pain)
78,00:05:28,00:05:30,I wasn't even supposed to work today.
79,00:05:30,00:05:32,I just needed the money.
80,00:05:32,00:05:34,I just need to ask...
81,00:05:34,00:05:38,could you recall your conversation you had with the bomber?
82,00:05:45,00:05:47,BOMBER: Are those your kids?
83,00:05:47,00:05:48,"Ah, yeah."
84,00:05:48,00:05:50,"Those are my babies. Oh, cute."
85,00:05:50,00:05:53,"Cubano cigars-- 50 bucks a stick, right?"
86,00:05:56,00:05:58,Could you come with me to the cage?
87,00:05:58,00:06:02,I just need to cash in a few chips first.
88,00:06:02,00:06:04,Sure.
89,00:06:04,00:06:07,"So, he was listening to someone on the other end of an earpiece?"
90,00:06:07,00:06:08,"FIREMAN: All right, check the fentanyl?"
91,00:06:08,00:06:10,"(gasps, groans) FIREMAN 2: Yeah."
92,00:06:10,00:06:12,FIREMAN: Tourniquet still in place? FIREMAN 2: It is.
93,00:06:12,00:06:15,My daughters' names...
94,00:06:15,00:06:19,are Helena and Maria.
95,00:06:19,00:06:21,All right.
96,00:06:21,00:06:23,FIREMAN 2: B.P.'s dropping.
97,00:06:23,00:06:24,(flat line tone sounding)
98,00:06:24,00:06:25,"FIREMAN 2: Doctor, we need some help over here."
99,00:06:25,00:06:26,Romina?
100,00:06:26,00:06:28,"Ma'am, please step back."
101,00:06:28,00:06:29,Start compressions.
102,00:06:29,00:06:32,"Go ahead to the hospital, prepare for arrival."
103,00:06:32,00:06:34,DOCTOR: Let's start a line.
104,00:06:55,00:06:56,FBI Special Agent Willows.
105,00:06:56,00:06:59,I've been authorized by the L.A. Bureau to take over this bomb sight.
106,00:07:03,00:07:05,"Sara! Catherine, hey."
107,00:07:05,00:07:06,I am so sorry. Hey.
108,00:07:06,00:07:08,What a mess.
109,00:07:08,00:07:10,Just got in from L.A. I saw the footage on the news.
110,00:07:10,00:07:12,How can I help?
111,00:07:12,00:07:14,"Well, I'm not exactly sure."
112,00:07:14,00:07:15,It's a conflict of interest.
113,00:07:15,00:07:17,"Legally, I'm the owner of the Eclipse."
114,00:07:17,00:07:19,This building and everything in it is my responsibility.
115,00:07:19,00:07:21,"Of course, yes. Yes, it is."
116,00:07:21,00:07:25,But... you and I both know you can't be in here.
117,00:07:25,00:07:27,Three of my employees are dead.
118,00:07:27,00:07:28,What am I supposed to do?
119,00:07:28,00:07:30,Wait in the hospitality suite?
120,00:07:33,00:07:35,"Look, Sara..."
121,00:07:35,00:07:39,"I'm not here to cause trouble, but I'm also not here to sit on the sidelines."
122,00:07:39,00:07:45,"And as long as there are bodies on the floor of my father's casino, I need to continue to work this case."
123,00:07:45,00:07:47,Okay?
124,00:07:47,00:07:48,Okay.
125,00:07:53,00:07:54,I ran your name.
126,00:07:54,00:07:57,Says you used to run the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
127,00:07:57,00:08:02,Long time ago. Do you mind telling me why you're unlawfully on this vessel?
128,00:08:02,00:08:05,"Well, see, that's my boat over there."
129,00:08:05,00:08:25,"The poacher who owns this boat has violated Fish and Game Code 8599, which states: ""It is unlawful to slice the dorsal fin ""off a Carcharodon Carcharias unless you bring the whole carcass ashore."" But white sharks can only be taken for scientific or educational purposes under permit."
130,00:08:25,00:08:27,This boat has no permit.
131,00:08:27,00:08:36,"My job is to confiscate the evidence, document it and prepare it for international and/or domestic court."
132,00:08:36,00:08:38,I had to ask.
133,00:08:38,00:08:42,"So, now you're what, a CSI at sea?"
134,00:08:42,00:08:44,Kind of.
135,00:08:44,00:08:47,Shark fin soup is bad.
136,00:08:47,00:08:49,It's worth getting arrested for.
137,00:08:57,00:08:59,(Willows scoffs)
138,00:08:59,00:09:02,Bastard lied about needing to get money from the cage.
139,00:09:02,00:09:06,He lured Romina over after he found out she had children.
140,00:09:06,00:09:07,BRASS: Pretty cruel.
141,00:09:10,00:09:12,Whew.
142,00:09:16,00:09:17,I'm good here.
143,00:09:17,00:09:19,Just release everything back to Sara.
144,00:09:19,00:09:25,"As far as this piece of work-- just grab his photo and run it through NCIC, BICTOF, local DMV-- I want a name."
145,00:09:27,00:09:31,Would you have assumed this if I was a nun or a Hasidic Jew?
146,00:09:31,00:09:33,They also cover themselves based on religious belief.
147,00:09:33,00:09:37,"Considering what your husband did, Mrs. Karmimi, I would."
148,00:09:37,00:09:42,"Hijab or no hijab, terrorism is not a stretch if you're on my side of the law."
149,00:09:42,00:09:47,"My husband converted to Islam because we fell in love, Mrs. Sidle."
150,00:09:47,00:09:51,I came to America so that I could live free as a woman.
151,00:09:51,00:09:59,"Here, women have a chance to live and to love without being stoned to death."
152,00:10:01,00:10:04,"To you, he's a criminal."
153,00:10:04,00:10:09,"But to me, he was a husband."
154,00:10:09,00:10:12,He was my salvation.
155,00:10:16,00:10:18,Sorry.
156,00:10:18,00:10:22,"Um, I-I didn't mean to offend you."
157,00:10:22,00:10:25,I'm sorry for your loss.
158,00:10:25,00:10:27,That does not forgive what he did to those people.
159,00:10:27,00:10:29,I know.
160,00:10:29,00:10:32,"Mrs. Karmimi, help me."
161,00:10:32,00:10:34,If not terrorism...
162,00:10:34,00:10:38,then why would your husband strap a bomb to his body and do that?
163,00:10:38,00:10:40,I don't know.
164,00:10:40,00:10:43,My husband is not a terrorist.
165,00:10:45,00:10:49,"If anything, he had a gambling problem."
166,00:10:49,00:10:53,I took him to our Imam to speak to him at the mosque.
167,00:10:53,00:10:55,I even took him to therapy.
168,00:10:55,00:10:57,Therapy for his addiction?
169,00:10:57,00:10:58,Yes.
170,00:10:58,00:11:02,He was doing well for a while.
171,00:11:02,00:11:08,"But then, the therapist of his, she unexpectedly quit her practice."
172,00:11:08,00:11:11,And then he just spiraled.
173,00:11:33,00:11:36,What the hell is that?
174,00:11:37,00:11:42,"Hey, you garbage men find anything gold and square, about yea big?"
175,00:11:42,00:11:46,Something gold and metal flew out of the bomber's vest.
176,00:11:46,00:11:48,"Chest-high, right side?"
177,00:11:48,00:11:48,Yeah.
178,00:11:48,00:11:51,Why? Uh...
179,00:11:51,00:11:59,"I noticed this hand-stitched lining on the inside of the bomber's vest, almost like a homemade pocket."
180,00:12:00,00:12:02,Gold metal piece.
181,00:12:02,00:12:06,"I found it earlier, but I wasn't sure what it was."
182,00:12:06,00:12:11,"This flew out of the bomber's right breast pocket, but this vest doesn't even have inside pockets."
183,00:12:11,00:12:16,Looks like this gold God-knows-what was purposely sewn into the vest.
184,00:12:16,00:12:17,Good catch.
185,00:12:17,00:12:21,"Now, there's some kind of etching on it."
186,00:12:21,00:12:23,Maybe I can lift it.
187,00:13:16,00:13:19,"Forgive me, but who is Lady Heather?"
188,00:13:19,00:13:23,"Uh, she's a sex therapist Grissom had a thing with back in the day-day."
189,00:13:23,00:13:28,"Not, like, a sexual one, more like... an intellectual one."
190,00:13:28,00:13:31,"Anyway, he worked a couple cases with her."
191,00:13:31,00:13:33,And against her.
192,00:13:33,00:13:34,So what do we think?
193,00:13:34,00:13:36,That she could be involved in this somehow?
194,00:13:36,00:13:44,"We don't know, but we'd like to find out why this piece of metal with Lady Heather's initials on it flew from the bomber's jacket."
195,00:13:46,00:13:48,ECKLIE: Sara.
196,00:13:48,00:13:50,Wait.
197,00:13:50,00:13:54,"This is gonna sound like an odd request, but do you know where Grissom is?"
198,00:13:54,00:13:55,Grissom? Yeah.
199,00:13:55,00:13:59,"Uh, let me see, grab a globe, spin it, look for the blue, and pick an ocean."
200,00:13:59,00:14:00,He could be anywhere.
201,00:14:00,00:14:03,Why? We think Lady Heather might have something to do with the bombing.
202,00:14:03,00:14:05,Lady Heather?
203,00:14:05,00:14:10,"Well, even if she did, what does that have to do with my ex-husband?"
204,00:14:10,00:14:12,"Lady Heather is in the wind, all right?"
205,00:14:12,00:14:15,"We're getting a warrant for her house, as we speak."
206,00:14:15,00:14:20,"Come on, if anybody knows this woman inside and out, it's Grissom; I figured he could provide some deeper insight."
207,00:14:20,00:14:23,"Conrad, with all due respect, this entire building is working the bombing case."
208,00:14:23,00:14:24,Greg and I have history with Lady Heather.
209,00:14:24,00:14:25,We-we got it covered.
210,00:14:25,00:14:28,"I know, Sara, but this bombing is international news now."
211,00:14:28,00:14:31,I'd feel better if we exhaust all resources.
212,00:14:31,00:14:34,Do you at least have his cell?
213,00:14:34,00:14:36,"(scoffs, chuckles)"
214,00:14:41,00:14:43,(cell phone rings)
215,00:14:45,00:14:47,"(phone ringing, buzzing)"
216,00:14:56,00:15:00,"GRISSOM: Well, if that's the case, Conrad, then I need to come up there."
217,00:15:00,00:15:02,But you're gonna have to get me out of this first.
218,00:15:05,00:15:08,Hello.
219,00:15:08,00:15:10,Let him go?
220,00:15:10,00:15:12,"Are you sure about this, Sheriff?"
221,00:15:12,00:15:13,Okay.
222,00:15:13,00:15:18,I'll arrange transport and relinquish him into your custody.
223,00:15:18,00:15:19,(sighs heavily)
224,00:15:19,00:15:20,"It's your lucky day, pal."
225,00:15:20,00:15:25,"I'd tell you not to leave town, but I guess you're going to Sin City."
226,00:15:25,00:15:28,Vegas.
227,00:16:14,00:16:19,(indistinct announcement over P.A.)
228,00:16:36,00:16:38,Mr. Grissom?
229,00:16:38,00:16:39,"Oh, my God."
230,00:16:39,00:16:41,Hi. Welcome back.
231,00:16:41,00:16:43,It's been a long time since I saw you last.
232,00:16:43,00:16:46,"Oh, but, hey, check it out-- CSI Level One."
233,00:16:46,00:16:47,I did it. (chuckles)
234,00:16:47,00:16:48,You know what the crazy thing is?
235,00:16:48,00:16:50,(whispering): It's my first day.
236,00:16:50,00:16:54,Do you want to take my blood or offer me a chocolate-covered grasshopper?
237,00:16:54,00:16:56,"Oh, but, uh, anyway, I gotta run."
238,00:16:56,00:16:58,"It was great to see you, as always."
239,00:16:58,00:16:59,See ya.
240,00:17:06,00:17:08,Sara.
241,00:17:08,00:17:09,Gil.
242,00:17:12,00:17:14,I'm back. (chuckles)
243,00:17:14,00:17:16,I see that.
244,00:17:16,00:17:19,ECKLIE: Grissom.
245,00:17:19,00:17:20,Hey.
246,00:17:20,00:17:22,Thanks for coming.
247,00:17:22,00:17:25,"Uh, let's step in D.B.'s office. Sara."
248,00:17:25,00:17:27,(whispers): Who's D.B.?
249,00:17:27,00:17:30,"D.B., Grissom."
250,00:17:30,00:17:32,Hi. I'm-I'm Diebenkorn Russell.
251,00:17:32,00:17:34,"Pleasure to finally meet you, Gil."
252,00:17:36,00:17:38,My brains used to sit on that shelf.
253,00:17:38,00:17:40,"Yeah, I, uh, traded brains for mushrooms."
254,00:17:40,00:17:42,Hope you don't mind.
255,00:17:42,00:17:45,"ECKLIE: Gil, we could really use some insight on Lady Heather."
256,00:17:45,00:17:47,The most pressing issue is this.
257,00:17:47,00:17:53,"At the blast site, we found a piece of gold metal with the letters LHK inscribed on it."
258,00:17:53,00:17:56,It flew out of the bomber's suicide vest.
259,00:17:56,00:17:58,"Well, that's her logo, but I don't know what this is."
260,00:17:58,00:18:02,ECKLIE: When was the last time you spoke with her?
261,00:18:02,00:18:04,"A few days ago, by phone."
262,00:18:04,00:18:07,Guess your cell service is better than it used to be.
263,00:18:07,00:18:09,Who wants to catch me up?
264,00:18:09,00:18:10,Gil! GRISSOM: Hey.
265,00:18:10,00:18:12,I heard you were coming by.
266,00:18:12,00:18:14,RUSSELL: Catherine...
267,00:18:14,00:18:19,"because your name is on the deed to the Eclipse, it might be cleaner if you work other avenues for us, okay?"
268,00:18:19,00:18:20,Sure.
269,00:18:20,00:18:25,I'll work up a chronological timeline and psychological profile on Lady Heather.
270,00:18:25,00:18:26,Good luck with that.
271,00:18:26,00:18:28,"ECKLIE: Sara, your warrant came in."
272,00:18:28,00:18:29,Lady Heather's house is all yours.
273,00:18:29,00:18:31,Perfect.
274,00:18:31,00:18:32,Grissom and I'll check it out.
275,00:18:46,00:18:49,"Wow, 30 minutes in the car, no words."
276,00:18:49,00:18:52,"If you were playing that silent car game, you definitely win."
277,00:18:54,00:18:57,I thought we were talking.
278,00:18:57,00:19:07,"All right, uh, listen, you know, before we go in there and deal with Lady Heather, I-I just want to acknowledge that you and I haven't spoken much since the divorce, or before it, for that matter."
279,00:19:07,00:19:08,We both went our separate ways.
280,00:19:08,00:19:11,"You're doing your Jacques Cousteau thing, I'm in the field."
281,00:19:11,00:19:13,"Things end, I-I get it."
282,00:19:13,00:19:21,"But-but you and I are professionals, and as professionals, I think it's in the best interests of the case if we put on a unified front."
283,00:19:21,00:19:23,"You know, work as a team."
284,00:19:23,00:19:28,"So, uh, let's put on our game faces and-and keep it professional."
285,00:19:28,00:19:31,See? Mine's on.
286,00:19:31,00:19:32,You ready to go in?
287,00:19:35,00:19:38,Seeing you again left me a little speechless.
288,00:19:40,00:19:42,Come on.
289,00:19:54,00:19:56,Dr. Kessler?
290,00:19:56,00:19:59,Las Vegas Crime Lab.
291,00:20:21,00:20:27,"WILLOWS: From 2000 to 2006, Lady Heather ran a role-playing Red Room out of her home."
292,00:20:27,00:20:32,"Whips, chains, pig masks, the whole ball of sex wax."
293,00:20:32,00:20:38,"SANDERS: In 2006, she shut down the Red Room after her daughter Zoe was murdered."
294,00:20:38,00:20:43,"Overnight, her Red Room clients became therapy patients where she started her own psychiatry practice."
295,00:20:43,00:20:47,"And three months ago, she abruptly shut down her practice."
296,00:20:47,00:20:48,Why?
297,00:20:48,00:20:56,"Well, here's a thought: This year, Lady Heather's granddaughter Alison, daughter of Zoe, was hit by a car while walking to school."
298,00:20:56,00:21:00,"She died three months ago, right around the time she quit her practice."
299,00:21:00,00:21:02,SANDERS: You think the two incidents are related?
300,00:21:02,00:21:03,I don't know yet.
301,00:21:03,00:21:05,(sighs)
302,00:21:05,00:21:10,"Lady Heather told me something a long time ago, that I never forgot."
303,00:21:10,00:21:21,"She told me that there are many things that you can give a man-- your body, your time, even your heart-- but that one thing that you could never, ever, ever let go of is your power."
304,00:21:21,00:21:25,I think that she lost everything that mattered to her-- her daughter and her granddaughter?
305,00:21:25,00:21:28,"I mean, it's painful enough to lose one child, but two?"
306,00:21:28,00:21:32,"I mean, what else does she have to live for but to wield her power of revenge?"
307,00:21:32,00:21:36,"Not to mention, we're dealing with a master of the human mind."
308,00:21:36,00:21:37,Yeah.
309,00:21:37,00:21:40,"If anybody can convince someone to blow themselves up, it's her."
310,00:21:55,00:21:57,Hmm...
311,00:21:57,00:21:58,What?
312,00:21:58,00:21:59,Do you got something?
313,00:21:59,00:22:04,Just put my pole in the water and I got a hit.
314,00:22:04,00:22:06,What is that?
315,00:22:08,00:22:11,"Sorry, I wish I had better news."
316,00:22:11,00:22:13,Especially given all the blood you guys found in Lady Heather's house.
317,00:22:13,00:22:15,None of these blood samples belong to Lady Heather.
318,00:22:15,00:22:17,Not one. Amelogenin is XY.
319,00:22:17,00:22:18,Donor's male.
320,00:22:18,00:22:21,DNA from the carpet doesn't even match the bomber.
321,00:22:21,00:22:22,So there's another male out there.
322,00:22:22,00:22:24,Along with Lady Heather.
323,00:22:24,00:22:28,WILLOWS: Robbins found the other half of the gold metal piece inside one of the female victims.
324,00:22:28,00:22:31,Looks like a key of some sort.
325,00:22:40,00:22:41,Not just any key.
326,00:22:41,00:22:43,This is a key to Heather's Red Room.
327,00:22:43,00:22:45,Where's that?
328,00:22:45,00:22:47,The dungeon.
329,00:23:23,00:23:25,(door creaking open)
330,00:23:52,00:23:55,"Oh, Heather, what have you done now?"
331,00:24:19,00:24:23,Am I interrupting anything?
332,00:24:23,00:24:25,"Only my precious thoughts, Henry."
333,00:24:27,00:24:29,Did you bring the movie?
334,00:24:29,00:24:30,Thumb drive.
335,00:24:56,00:25:00,"What are you, Henry, about five-ten, 160 pounds?"
336,00:25:00,00:25:03,164. Why?
337,00:25:03,00:25:05,I'm gonna make a bomb.
338,00:25:05,00:25:07,We're gonna blow you up.
339,00:25:07,00:25:08,Oh.
340,00:25:08,00:25:10,Okay.
341,00:25:10,00:25:11,Great.
342,00:25:12,00:25:17,"ANDREWS: So, um, where did you learn how to build homemade bombs?"
343,00:25:17,00:25:25,"And, um, does the bomb you're currently working on have, uh, any chance of blowing us up?"
344,00:25:25,00:25:33,"If our organization fails to put poachers in jail for pillaging our oceans, we've been known to blow holes in their boats."
345,00:25:33,00:25:34,You can do that?
346,00:25:34,00:25:36,Not legally.
347,00:25:39,00:25:40,There.
348,00:25:41,00:25:42,Put the vest on.
349,00:25:46,00:25:47,(sighs anxiously)
350,00:25:54,00:25:55,I see I'm right on time.
351,00:25:57,00:25:59,"(beeping) Okay, bomb's hot."
352,00:25:59,00:26:01,Behind the wall.
353,00:26:16,00:26:18,"GRISSOM: Three, two, one..."
354,00:26:39,00:26:42,Look at the blast circumference.
355,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Now, look at the blast pattern from the casino."
356,00:26:45,00:26:48,"SIDLE: Yeah, they're identical."
357,00:26:48,00:26:50,Hmm.
358,00:26:50,00:26:52,Now look at this.
359,00:26:56,00:26:59,See the outline on the brick of the C4 wrapper?
360,00:26:59,00:27:00,The rectangle?
361,00:27:00,00:27:04,There's enough explosive here to level the entire casino floor.
362,00:27:04,00:27:09,"Well, based on the tool marks in the stick of putty, the bomber only used a quarter of the explosive."
363,00:27:09,00:27:12,Explains why there weren't more casualties.
364,00:27:12,00:27:16,What's bothering me is all the C4 we can't account for.
365,00:27:20,00:27:22,(piano playing upbeat melody)
366,00:27:50,00:27:51,Sure.
367,00:28:21,00:28:22,Sit down!
368,00:28:25,00:28:28,"(kids continue singing; parents murmuring, whispering)"
369,00:28:30,00:28:32,Should I pull it now?
370,00:28:34,00:28:36,I'm gonna pull it now.
371,00:28:36,00:28:37,"MAN: Hey, down in front!"
372,00:28:37,00:28:39,"WOMAN: Your seat's back here, ma'am. MAN: Hey, lady!"
373,00:28:39,00:28:41,Pull it now?
374,00:28:43,00:28:45,"Hey, you're blocking the view."
375,00:28:48,00:28:49,"My God, she's got a bomb!"
376,00:28:49,00:28:51,"(everyone screaming) Oh, my God! Go!"
377,00:28:55,00:28:56,"(screaming, clamoring)"
378,00:28:59,00:29:02,"(screaming, clamoring fade into distance)"
379,00:29:08,00:29:10,(door creaks shut)
380,00:29:25,00:29:26,ANTHONY HURST: Ma'am?
381,00:29:26,00:29:31,(over radio): I'm here from the Las Vegas Bomb Disposal Unit.
382,00:29:31,00:29:32,Is it okay if I approach?
383,00:29:39,00:29:40,(sirens wailing in distance) Are you doing okay?
384,00:29:43,00:29:45,(siren approaching) You're doing great.
385,00:29:45,00:29:47,I just want to check you out.
386,00:29:47,00:29:50,Can you tell me your name?
387,00:29:54,00:29:56,"Ma'am, I..."
388,00:29:56,00:29:58,I'm gonna have to get a little closer to take a peek.
389,00:30:22,00:30:25,I'm gonna get you out of here in no time.
390,00:30:27,00:30:28,Correction.
391,00:30:28,00:30:30,I'll get us out of here in no time.
392,00:30:30,00:30:31,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no."
393,00:30:31,00:30:33,"You don't want to do that, ma'am."
394,00:30:33,00:30:34,"You're already a hero today, ma'am."
395,00:30:34,00:30:36,All the children got out alive.
396,00:30:36,00:30:40,Why would she make me say that?
397,00:30:40,00:30:43,"Someone's feeding her commands, just like the male bomber."
398,00:30:43,00:30:45,"Can you get audio on the voice, male or female?"
399,00:30:45,00:30:46,Anthony...
400,00:30:46,00:30:49,can you establish gender of the voice in her ear?
401,00:30:49,00:30:50,"No, negative."
402,00:30:50,00:30:53,The voice is too soft.
403,00:30:56,00:30:59,I got four colored wires here.
404,00:30:59,00:31:01,I'm gonna have to cut them in order.
405,00:31:01,00:31:03,WOMAN: Okay...
406,00:31:05,00:31:08,I will. I'll tell him.
407,00:31:09,00:31:11,Sir?
408,00:31:12,00:31:13,Sir?
409,00:31:13,00:31:15,I'm almost there. Stop!
410,00:31:19,00:31:20,Time's up.
411,00:31:20,00:31:22,I just got one more.
412,00:31:22,00:31:25,I'm here for Lady Heather.
413,00:31:26,00:31:27,(explosion thunders)
414,00:31:27,00:31:29,(car alarms wailing) OFFICER: Let's go! Move!
415,00:31:29,00:31:31,Inside! Move out! Let's go!
416,00:31:31,00:31:34,"Oh, my God."
417,00:31:40,00:31:42,(sirens wailing in distance)
418,00:31:51,00:31:53,(indistinct radio communication in distance)
419,00:31:59,00:32:01,SIDLE: It doesn't make sense.
420,00:32:01,00:32:06,"Why wouldn't the bomber take out every man, woman and child when she could?"
421,00:32:06,00:32:13,I think whoever was on the other end of that earpiece was in the process of trying to exercise control.
422,00:32:13,00:32:15,I think...
423,00:32:15,00:32:17,he was sending us a message.
424,00:32:17,00:32:18,"""He""?"
425,00:32:18,00:32:23,You don't even think there's a possibility that Lady Heather was on the other end of that earpiece?
426,00:32:23,00:32:24,I don't.
427,00:32:24,00:32:25,"Gil, she's a puppeteer."
428,00:32:25,00:32:29,She's been controlling people for a living for years.
429,00:32:29,00:32:35,"So, according to your theory, Lady Heather is the dominant in this scenario, giving orders."
430,00:32:35,00:32:38,"And the female bomber is the submissive, taking orders, right?"
431,00:32:38,00:32:43,"Right. By rule, the dominant is not allowed to hurt the submissive."
432,00:32:43,00:32:48,"And if, for some reason, they do, the submissive is allowed to use the safe word and discontinue the pain."
433,00:32:48,00:32:49,This is not some fetish game.
434,00:32:49,00:32:57,"Sara, Heather would never hurt anyone with the intent to kill, especially innocent people and children."
435,00:32:57,00:33:01,It goes against everything she stands for therapeutically.
436,00:33:03,00:33:06,What was your safe word with her?
437,00:33:08,00:33:10,Stop.
438,00:33:10,00:33:13,We certainly could've used that word today.
439,00:33:41,00:33:43,"Hello, girls."
440,00:33:43,00:33:44,My name is Catherine Willows.
441,00:33:44,00:33:46,I'm a special agent with the FBI.
442,00:33:46,00:33:50,You're probably wondering why you're here.
443,00:33:51,00:33:52,(sighs quietly)
444,00:33:52,00:33:57,"At school today, did you hear about anything happening in the news?"
445,00:34:01,00:34:04,Some kid said a bomb went off?
446,00:34:04,00:34:05,That's right.
447,00:34:05,00:34:10,There was an explosion at the Eclipse hotel.
448,00:34:10,00:34:13,Mom works there.
449,00:34:13,00:34:16,"I know, sweetheart, that's why I'm here."
450,00:34:16,00:34:19,Is she okay?
451,00:34:21,00:34:24,"I'm sorry, honey..."
452,00:34:24,00:34:27,your mother passed away earlier today.
453,00:34:27,00:34:30,(both crying)
454,00:34:37,00:34:40,But listen...
455,00:34:40,00:34:50,"I want you to know that I was with your mom before she died, and she held my hand like I'm holding yours right now..."
456,00:34:50,00:34:59,and she told me how proud she was of her daughters Maria and Helena.
457,00:35:01,00:35:05,What's gonna happen now?
458,00:35:05,00:35:07,Who's gonna look after us?
459,00:35:08,00:35:11,What about your father?
460,00:35:11,00:35:13,Mom was all we had.
461,00:35:13,00:35:17,We don't have anyone else.
462,00:35:22,00:35:25,I talked to the principal.
463,00:35:25,00:35:28,The woman who blew herself up was a teacher here.
464,00:35:28,00:35:30,This is her classroom.
465,00:35:30,00:35:33,"According to him, she'd been put on administrative leave twice, for mental instability."
466,00:35:33,00:35:36,The school district paid for a therapist.
467,00:35:36,00:35:39,You'll never guess the name.
468,00:35:39,00:35:42,Dr. Kessler.
469,00:35:49,00:35:54,What kind of a person straps a bomb to her chest and self-detonates it at a school?
470,00:36:00,00:36:04,Perhaps someone under the influence of Devil's Breath.
471,00:36:06,00:36:07,Burundanga.
472,00:36:07,00:36:09,The most dangerous drug in the world.
473,00:36:09,00:36:12,It's a flower that grows rampant in South America.
474,00:36:12,00:36:17,"One whiff of its airborne pollen, and the recipient relinquishes all control."
475,00:36:17,00:36:26,They'll do anything on command from emptying their bank accounts for strangers to putting on a suicide vest.
476,00:36:28,00:36:30,I found these on the teacher's desk.
477,00:36:30,00:36:37,My theory is that who's behind the bombings gave her these flowers right before she went into that school play.
478,00:36:37,00:36:38,Wow... (laughs)
479,00:36:38,00:36:40,Thank you.
480,00:36:40,00:36:42,"Um, that's so sweet."
481,00:36:42,00:36:45,"Uh, are you, are you a parent?"
482,00:36:45,00:36:47,"(inhales, exhales)"
483,00:36:51,00:37:02,"GRISSOM: Neurologically, the drug is so potent, it literally turned off the judgment receptors in her brain, 'causing her to kill without processing the consequences."
484,00:37:03,00:37:07,"So, did the first bomber, the male from the casino, have Devil's Breath in his system?"
485,00:37:07,00:37:09,"According to tox, no."
486,00:37:09,00:37:12,"BRASS: Well, I don't think the male bomber needed any extra flower power."
487,00:37:12,00:37:15,He was already pissed off at the casino for losing all his money.
488,00:37:15,00:37:19,"SANDERS: So, what are the connections between the two bombers?"
489,00:37:19,00:37:21,Both were patients of Lady Heather.
490,00:37:22,00:37:26,"WILLOWS: Is she the co-conspirator in all this, or the mastermind?"
491,00:37:26,00:37:29,I think she's being framed.
492,00:37:32,00:37:42,"SIDLE: Uh, Grissom has this theory that Lady Heather's being framed even though he doesn't have a motive and making every argument to validate her innocence, when everything that he's ever taught us about the sanctity of evidence..."
493,00:37:42,00:37:45,points to her.
494,00:37:46,00:37:48,Everything you say is true.
495,00:37:48,00:37:50,But we still don't have proof.
496,00:37:50,00:37:52,"So, what if it's not her?"
497,00:37:52,00:37:56,Who else could it be?
498,00:37:56,00:38:00,Who might have access to things they shouldn't have access to?
499,00:38:13,00:38:15,(device beeping intermittently)
500,00:38:17,00:38:19,(device beeping continuously)
501,00:38:20,00:38:22,(beeping stops)
502,00:39:05,00:39:07,Three months of cassettes missing.
503,00:39:17,00:39:18,"Hey, Jim."
504,00:39:18,00:39:21,"(clunk nearby) BRASS: Go ahead, Sara. What's up?"
505,00:39:21,00:39:23,Hello?
506,00:39:27,00:39:29,"Jim, are you still outside?"
507,00:39:29,00:39:30,I'm here.
508,00:39:30,00:39:32,There's someone in the house.
509,00:39:37,00:39:39,Dr. Kessler?
510,00:39:44,00:39:46,Dr. Kessler!
511,00:39:46,00:39:48,Stop right there! Heather!
512,00:39:48,00:39:49,Stop! Don't move!
513,00:39:49,00:39:51,"(engine starts, revs)"
514,00:39:51,00:39:52,Heather!
515,00:40:04,00:40:05,You okay?
516,00:40:05,00:40:07,"Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right."
517,00:40:07,00:40:08,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
518,00:40:08,00:40:09,"Hey, hey."
519,00:40:09,00:40:10,"You have some thermal burns, okay?"
520,00:40:10,00:40:11,We need to get you to the hospital.
521,00:40:11,00:40:13,"Just stay with me, all right?"
522,00:40:13,00:40:14,Hold onto me.
523,00:40:14,00:40:15,This is CSI Sidle.
524,00:40:15,00:40:18,I need an ambulance and the fire department.
525,00:40:19,00:40:20,"DISPATCH: Copy that, CSI Sidle."
526,00:40:20,00:40:22,(continues indistinctly) ...ambulance and fire.
527,00:41:02,00:41:04,"I'm sorry, Gil."
528,00:41:37,00:41:38,WOMAN: Ah...
529,00:41:38,00:41:40,"MAN: Yeah, I mean, we're hiring, so..."
530,00:41:40,00:41:43,"WOMAN: Hmm, yeah, well, I know that, but..."
531,00:41:43,00:41:45,you weren't paying very much.
532,00:41:53,00:41:54,"Hello, Heather."
533,00:41:57,00:41:59,Thank you for coming.
534,00:42:04,00:42:06,You still have your rings.
535,00:42:06,00:42:09,You never take your rings off.
536,00:42:09,00:42:11,Why would I?
537,00:42:16,00:42:18,I have to bring you in.
538,00:42:19,00:42:24,Everyone in law enforcement thinks you're responsible for these bombings.
539,00:42:28,00:42:30,I am.
