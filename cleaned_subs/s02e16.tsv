0	00:00:22	00:00:24	What are you waiting for? Call it!
1	00:00:30	00:00:31	Come on, come on. Coming through.
2	00:00:37	00:00:39	Let me have a look.
3	00:00:40	00:00:42	Okay, you're out.
4	00:00:42	00:00:43	Myles will move in from the second line.
5	00:00:43	00:00:45	Forget about Myles, I'm going back in.
6	00:00:45	00:00:46	Stitch me.
7	00:00:46	00:00:47	Terry, will you relax?
8	00:00:47	00:00:49	It's a weekend league, it's not the NHL.
9	00:00:49	00:00:50	It is to me.
10	00:00:50	00:00:52	You're not 100%.
11	00:00:52	00:00:53	What are you, a doctor or a coach?
12	00:00:53	00:00:54	Do me a favor, stitch.
13	00:01:01	00:01:02	Come on.
14	00:01:54	00:01:56	Get the doc.
15	00:02:04	00:02:05	Where's the body?
16	00:02:05	00:02:09	On the bench-- he was moved there after he collapsed in front of the net.
17	00:02:09	00:02:13	Apparently, uh the guy was responsive enough to be helped off the ice.
18	00:02:13	00:02:16	He died a few minutes later.
19	00:02:32	00:02:39	This looks fresh. Well, according to the on-site doctor, he took one across the cheek earlier in the second period.
20	00:02:39	00:02:43	Well, I guess this must be from the third period.
21	00:02:43	00:02:47	Looks like that other team worked him over pretty good.
22	00:02:47	00:02:48	Hockey, rough game.
23	00:02:49	00:02:51	Yeah, it's murder.
24	00:03:25	00:03:27	Two minutes for elbowing.
25	00:03:27	00:03:28	Four minutes for high sticking.
26	00:03:28	00:03:31	Ten minutes, unsportsmanlike conduct.
27	00:03:31	00:03:32	Boys will be boys.
28	00:03:32	00:03:36	Yeah, sounds like these boys went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.
29	00:03:36	00:03:37	You just don't like sports.
30	00:03:37	00:03:40	That's not true-- I've been a baseball fan my whole life.
31	00:03:40	00:03:42	Baseball. Well, that figures. All those stats.
32	00:03:43	00:03:44	It's a beautiful game.
33	00:03:44	00:03:46	Since when are you interested in beauty?
34	00:03:46	00:03:47	Since I met you.
35	00:03:49	00:03:54	So, we'll start at the opposite goal work our way across the blue line to center ice.
36	00:03:55	00:03:57	Sure.
37	00:05:23	00:05:25	It's not much to go on.
38	00:05:25	00:05:28	Maybe we should be looking off the ice.
39	00:05:37	00:05:39	So, why did you move the body?
40	00:05:39	00:05:42	You ever tried treating someone on the ice wearing just street shoes?
41	00:05:42	00:05:44	Then Mr. Rivers was still breathing?
42	00:05:44	00:05:46	When I brought him back to the bench, yes.
43	00:05:46	00:05:49	Then I performed CPR, and he didn't respond.
44	00:05:49	00:05:51	Did you also do the stitch work?
45	00:05:53	00:05:55	I'm the on-site doctor for this facility.
46	00:05:55	00:05:59	The stitches held, and I advised Terry not to go back on the ice.
47	00:05:59	00:06:02	So, if he'd listened, he'd still be alive.
48	00:06:06	00:06:08	What do these guys play for?
49	00:06:08	00:06:09	A little money?
50	00:06:09	00:06:11	Imitation Stanley Cup?
51	00:06:11	00:06:13	We play for the pride of it.
52	00:06:15	00:06:17	And the joy of kicking ass.
53	00:06:17	00:06:18	You are...?
54	00:06:18	00:06:20	Tommy Sconzo.
55	00:06:20	00:06:22	Right wing, first line.
56	00:06:22	00:06:24	Hitting's part of the game.
57	00:06:24	00:06:27	Take away the physical aspect you've got figure skating.
58	00:06:27	00:06:29	Guys out there doing triple lutzes.
59	00:06:29	00:06:31	Is that how you lost the, uh...?
60	00:06:32	00:06:34	The sit spin? Second period, number nine.
61	00:06:35	00:06:36	The guy's a real McCracken.
62	00:06:36	00:06:38	Which means? He gave me a high stick to the mouth.
63	00:06:38	00:06:39	That's why my guys crashed the goalie.
64	00:06:39	00:06:40	An eye for an eye, you know?
65	00:06:41	00:06:43	That why your guy ended up dead?
66	00:06:47	00:06:49	What can I tell you, lady?
67	00:06:49	00:06:51	It all happened so fast, you know?
68	00:06:51	00:06:53	Usually does.
69	00:06:59	00:07:02	There are three things in life that people like to stare at.
70	00:07:02	00:07:08	A rippling stream, a fire in a fireplace and a Zamboni going round and round.
71	00:07:08	00:07:10	Charlie Brown.
72	00:07:10	00:07:11	I love Zambonis.
73	00:07:11	00:07:13	We all do.
74	00:07:49	00:07:53	The thing I love about Zambonis is they pick up everything.
75	00:07:54	00:07:55	Hey.
76	00:07:56	00:07:58	Yeah?
77	00:07:58	00:08:01	I'm afraid the other part of this tooth might be in there.
78	00:08:04	00:08:08	Time to combine Foyeer's Law of Conduction with Newton's Law of Cooling.
79	00:08:08	00:08:12	Pile of ice measures nine feet by five feet...
80	00:08:15	00:08:16	by...
81	00:08:18	00:08:19	nine feet.
82	00:08:20	00:08:23	Without the calculus, I'd estimate...
83	00:08:23	00:08:25	100 cubic feet.
84	00:08:25	00:08:27	Current temperature, one degree Celsius.
85	00:08:27	00:08:32	The heaters max out at 90 degrees, but the variables are constantly changing.
86	00:08:32	00:08:33	Let's ballpark it.
87	00:08:33	00:08:37	I don't know, 50-cubic-foot melt per hour, if we're lucky?
88	00:08:37	00:08:40	120 minutes for a tooth...
89	00:08:40	00:08:41	the whole tooth...
90	00:08:41	00:08:44	and nothing but the tooth.
91	00:08:53	00:08:55	Whoo! There's a winner.
92	00:08:55	00:08:57	Easy come, easy go.
93	00:09:50	00:09:52	Lockwood, Homicide.
94	00:09:52	00:09:53	DFO's in the back.
95	00:09:53	00:09:54	Lead the way.
96	00:10:16	00:10:18	Stan Grevey, 35.
97	00:10:18	00:10:19	Backup sax player.
98	00:10:20	00:10:22	One of the waitresses found him.
99	00:10:29	00:10:31	Tiny scrubbing bubbles.
100	00:10:31	00:10:35	Yeah, after somebody wiped them down.
101	00:10:35	00:10:37	Paramedics?
102	00:10:37	00:10:38	Nope. Just pronounced, that's it.
103	00:10:38	00:10:40	Just pronounced?
104	00:10:41	00:10:43	Had an interesting diet.
105	00:10:43	00:10:44	Cowhide.
106	00:10:51	00:10:52	He tied himself off.
107	00:10:52	00:10:53	Yup.
108	00:10:53	00:10:57	All the signs of an O.D...
109	00:10:57	00:10:59	without any of the paraphernalia.
110	00:10:59	00:11:04	Your waitress say anything about a needle butane torch, that sort of thing?
111	00:11:04	00:11:05	No, not a word.
112	00:11:05	00:11:07	Just said he reminded her of Coltrane.
113	00:11:07	00:11:09	Coltrane, huh?
114	00:11:12	00:11:13	See if I can get this back to Gregor at the lab.
115	00:11:13	00:11:15	He could tell us what we're dealing with.
116	00:11:17	00:11:20	Two coasters, one glass?
117	00:11:20	00:11:21	What do you think?
118	00:11:21	00:11:24	Our guy was having a little party with the waitress?
119	00:11:24	00:11:25	She was just coming on shift.
120	00:11:25	00:11:27	She came through me. Already cleared her.
121	00:11:27	00:11:30	Well, somebody was here...
122	00:11:30	00:11:33	grabbed the stuff took their glass.
123	00:11:41	00:11:43	Forgot this on the way out.
124	00:11:48	00:11:50	Safe bet the contact wasn't his.
125	00:11:51	00:11:53	Hey, how's he doing? Whoa, whoa...
126	00:11:53	00:11:55	Miss, you can't come in here. Why not?
127	00:11:55	00:11:56	I'm sorry, he's dead.
128	00:11:56	00:11:57	He's dead? What are you talking about?
129	00:11:57	00:11:59	They told me he wasn't feeling well.
130	00:11:59	00:12:01	He was backing me up an hour ago.
131	00:12:01	00:12:03	What happened to him? Miss...
132	00:12:03	00:12:05	Why don't we step outside for a minute?
133	00:12:16	00:12:19	What took you so long?
134	00:12:19	00:12:20	I was watching ice melt.
135	00:12:20	00:12:23	Tox screen came up empty Except for quinine.
136	00:12:23	00:12:25	Must have had malaria in the past six months.
137	00:12:25	00:12:28	Either that or he's a big gin and tonic drinker.
138	00:12:28	00:12:30	I've ordered up his medical records.
139	00:12:30	00:12:34	If I was this guy I'd have been popping pain pills.
140	00:12:34	00:12:41	Hairline fracture of the ulna bruised kidney ten stitches off the orbital bone fractured nasal bone, all recent.
141	00:12:42	00:12:44	Healed rib fractures.
142	00:12:44	00:12:47	He should have worn a cage.
143	00:12:51	00:12:55	I bet he was proud of every last battle scar.
144	00:12:55	00:12:57	What is it about organized sports?
145	00:12:57	00:13:00	Well, organized sports is the paradigmatic model of a just society.
146	00:13:00	00:13:02	Everyone knows the same language everyone knows the rules.
147	00:13:03	00:13:07	And there's a specific punishment handed out the moment someone tries to cheat.
148	00:13:07	00:13:08	Instant morality.
149	00:13:08	00:13:11	So, uh, what did this guy do in real life?
150	00:13:11	00:13:13	Stockbroker.
151	00:13:13	00:13:15	Competition junky.
152	00:13:15	00:13:16	Aren't we all?
153	00:13:16	00:13:17	Not me, not anymore.
154	00:13:18	00:13:19	No?
155	00:13:19	00:13:21	How'd you get to be chief medical examiner?
156	00:13:21	00:13:24	Look, we're all carrying prehistoric genes in a postmodern world.
157	00:13:24	00:13:28	We get our meat from the grocery store instead of with a club or a knife.
158	00:13:28	00:13:31	We have to work off our, uh, testosterone somehow.
159	00:13:31	00:13:32	Foibles of youth.
160	00:13:32	00:13:33	Yeah.
161	00:13:33	00:13:36	So, cause of death?
162	00:13:36	00:13:38	Not sure.
163	00:13:38	00:13:41	This cut nicked his carotid.
164	00:13:41	00:13:44	Double-edged, clean blade, hockey skate, uh...
165	00:13:44	00:13:45	could have killed him.
166	00:13:46	00:13:47	Fun continues.
167	00:13:47	00:13:50	Basilar artery also suffered significant trauma.
168	00:13:50	00:13:52	Evidence of blood in the intimal space.
169	00:13:52	00:13:55	Possibly enough to cause syncope.
170	00:13:55	00:13:56	Loss of consciousness.
171	00:13:56	00:14:01	Well, it could explain why the vic ended up in the bottom of that pile.
172	00:14:02	00:14:07	So did his death cause his fall or did his fall cause his death?
173	00:14:12	00:14:14	What'd you get from Area 51?
174	00:14:14	00:14:15	Terry Rivers was an instigator.
175	00:14:16	00:14:17	Always stirring the pot.
176	00:14:17	00:14:19	Every fire needs a match.
177	00:14:19	00:14:21	So, I guess this is their equipment?
178	00:14:21	00:14:22	Yeah, down to the last stick.
179	00:14:22	00:14:24	Here's a copy of the team roster.
180	00:14:24	00:14:25	Okay.
181	00:14:25	00:14:27	See you later. Okay.
182	00:14:30	00:14:32	Ms. Gallagher?
183	00:14:32	00:14:33	Yeah.
184	00:14:33	00:14:35	Catherine Willows Crime Lab.
185	00:14:36	00:14:37	I understand you play for Area 51.
186	00:14:38	00:14:40	Did you see much ice time during the game?
187	00:14:40	00:14:43	No, they just let me take off my cheerleader uniform and warm the bench.
188	00:14:43	00:14:46	You know what? Been there, done that.
189	00:14:46	00:14:47	Just asking a question here.
190	00:14:47	00:14:51	I played 24 minutes, 12 seconds-- about my season average.
191	00:14:52	00:14:53	I also lead the team in assists.
192	00:14:53	00:14:56	Oh... you've got good peripheral vision.
193	00:14:56	00:14:57	You see the ice really well.
194	00:14:57	00:14:59	I didn't see what happened to Terry.
195	00:14:59	00:15:01	You're a real teammate.
196	00:15:01	00:15:03	Down the line, just one of the guys.
197	00:15:03	00:15:06	You're looking in the wrong direction.
198	00:15:06	00:15:09	Now, we may have disliked Terry but his own teammates...
199	00:15:09	00:15:11	hated him.
200	00:15:11	00:15:13	Any reason why?
201	00:15:14	00:15:16	How would I know? I'm just a girl.
202	00:15:17	00:15:19	Can I go now?
203	00:15:24	00:15:26	Nice bike.
204	00:15:39	00:15:42	Just getting into the mind of a potential killer.
205	00:15:42	00:15:43	Potential killer?
206	00:15:44	00:15:46	Why don't you just catch us up there, boss?
207	00:15:46	00:15:48	In a minute.
208	00:15:48	00:15:52	First things first-- your contact lens was worn by a near-sighted person.
209	00:15:52	00:15:57	And since I was born with perfect eyesight I'm experimenting with what it would feel like to be near-sighted.
210	00:15:57	00:15:59	Don't tell us you're wearing our evidence.
211	00:15:59	00:16:02	Come on, Greg.
212	00:16:02	00:16:03	Give me some credit.
213	00:16:03	00:16:08	Borrowing a pair of lenses from Archie in A/V.
214	00:16:08	00:16:10	Giving me a headache, though.
215	00:16:15	00:16:19	Mannitol-- that's that baby laxative used to cut heroin with.
216	00:16:19	00:16:21	China White? You sure?
217	00:16:21	00:16:24	The GCMS does not kid around.
218	00:16:24	00:16:26	West coast heroin is Mexican Brown.
219	00:16:26	00:16:28	20, 30% pure, tops.
220	00:16:28	00:16:30	What's China White, 75%?
221	00:16:30	00:16:31	Uh, your sample's 91.
222	00:16:32	00:16:37	91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'d.
223	00:16:37	00:16:37	That's a death sentence.
224	00:16:37	00:16:39	Doesn't make any sense, man.
225	00:16:39	00:16:41	The money from dealing heroin comes from the cutting.
226	00:16:41	00:16:44	The more you cut, the more money you make.
227	00:16:44	00:16:46	There's no profit margin in selling stuff that's too pure.
228	00:16:47	00:16:50	Unless you're looking to kill someone.
229	00:16:51	00:16:55	So, this is what being a stockbroker buys you.
230	00:17:01	00:17:04	Hmm, well.
231	00:17:04	00:17:07	How do men live like this?
232	00:17:07	00:17:10	What's wrong with it?
233	00:17:10	00:17:14	Well, it's a cave with hardwood floors.
234	00:17:15	00:17:16	It's clean.
235	00:17:19	00:17:22	Television, couch. What else does a guy need?
236	00:17:22	00:17:23	Well, how about a plant?
237	00:17:23	00:17:27	Anything to makes it a little more... human.
238	00:17:27	00:17:30	I mean, it doesn't seem like this guy had any...
239	00:17:30	00:17:32	connection to anybody.
240	00:17:33	00:17:36	I don't know about that.
241	00:17:56	00:18:04	It's never a good sign when the number of women a guy sleeps with is greater than the number of chairs he owns.
242	00:18:04	00:18:06	So, what's the ratio here?
243	00:18:07	00:18:11	Well, uh, ballparking it, I'd say...
244	00:18:11	00:18:16	four women to every one piece of furniture he owns including the TV.
245	00:18:19	00:18:21	So...
246	00:18:21	00:18:26	I guess our guy is about three things-- pucks, bucks, and...
247	00:18:28	00:18:29	chicks.
248	00:18:29	00:18:32	Well, we still don't know how or why he died.
249	00:18:32	00:18:35	Well, we know how he lived.
250	00:18:40	00:18:41	Any blood?
251	00:18:41	00:18:42	Take your pick.
252	00:18:42	00:18:47	Testing for blood on a hockey jersey it's like handing out jaywalking tickets at a marathon.
253	00:18:47	00:18:49	Well, speaking on a meta-level...
254	00:18:49	00:18:52	Isn't it obvious?
255	00:18:52	00:19:02	The overbearing patriarchal structure of modern organized sports represents a socially palatable sublimation of what Jung refers to as the shadows of the unconscious.
256	00:19:03	00:19:04	You sucked at team sports, huh?
257	00:19:04	00:19:07	I was captain of the high school chess squad.
258	00:19:07	00:19:11	Chess is not a sport, Greg.
259	00:19:15	00:19:18	Then why is there a world chess champion?
260	00:19:18	00:19:22	I think sports are physical by definition.
261	00:19:22	00:19:24	Well, sex is physical.
262	00:19:24	00:19:25	Is that a sport?
263	00:19:25	00:19:27	Not to me.
264	00:19:32	00:19:36	These blades skated through the blood pool.
265	00:19:48	00:19:50	Blood spatter.
266	00:19:50	00:19:55	Good guess-- this is the one that did the damage.
267	00:19:55	00:20:01	You know, I had a roommate in college freshman year, from Edmonton, went on to play for the Swedish Elite League.
268	00:20:01	00:20:03	Anyways, he set his blade at half an inch, tops.
269	00:20:03	00:20:07	And I should know, because he made me get them sharpened.
270	00:20:07	00:20:09	These blades are probably set at a quarter of an inch.
271	00:20:10	00:20:13	Well, that's as sharp as it gets.
272	00:20:13	00:20:14	It's a tough blade to skate on.
273	00:20:14	00:20:16	We're talking Wayne Gretzky style.
274	00:20:16	00:20:18	And deadly in a fight.
275	00:20:29	00:20:31	Yeah, that victim was out of L.A.
276	00:20:31	00:20:35	and I don't think the singer, Lillie met him before last night, so she may be in the clear.
277	00:20:35	00:20:38	Sure you don't want to start in the dressing room?
278	00:20:38	00:20:40	Right...
279	00:20:40	00:20:43	like you're going to take Dumpster duty alone.
280	00:20:43	00:20:47	Hey, just 'cause I've been on a personal losing streak with the ladies doesn't mean you should be, too.
281	00:20:47	00:20:50	Man, I don't even know if I'm going to go there.
282	00:20:50	00:20:52	The odds haven't gone my way in a long time.
283	00:20:52	00:20:55	I'm talking about chicks, not gambling.
284	00:20:55	00:20:56	Same difference.
285	00:20:58	00:21:00	Mind if I go for her, then?
286	00:21:14	00:21:15	Warrick.
287	00:21:28	00:21:32	It's mine-- but anybody could have lifted this scarf from my dressing room.
288	00:21:33	00:21:36	It's still yours.
289	00:21:36	00:21:38	You trying to pin this on me, now?
290	00:21:38	00:21:40	We're just doing our jobs here.
291	00:21:40	00:21:42	Well, did you find my fingerprints on anything?
292	00:21:42	00:21:43	We won't know till we print you.
293	00:21:43	00:21:47	Oh, I'm not worried. What you see is what you get.
294	00:21:51	00:21:52	You're putting words in my mouth.
295	00:21:52	00:21:54	You said everybody hated him-- now we know why.
296	00:21:54	00:21:56	We opened up Terry's hard drive.
297	00:21:56	00:22:00	It turns out he had your entire roster knee-deep in the stock market.
298	00:22:00	00:22:02	I don't play for the rat pack.
299	00:22:02	00:22:03	Not now...
300	00:22:03	00:22:04	but you used to.
301	00:22:04	00:22:07	Okay, so I changed teams. Big deal. I wanted to win.
302	00:22:07	00:22:12	The fact that Terry Rivers churned and burned your brokerage account out of ten grand that didn't enter into it?
303	00:22:12	00:22:13	Terry was a stockbroker.
304	00:22:13	00:22:15	He did really well for himself-- Rolex, Beemer.
305	00:22:15	00:22:16	He said he could do the same for me.
306	00:22:17	00:22:17	I gave him some money.
307	00:22:18	00:22:20	If I wasn't willing to take a risk I'd have put it in a bank.
308	00:22:20	00:22:22	You weren't the only one, were you?
309	00:22:22	00:22:24	No. All the guys had money with him.
310	00:22:24	00:22:26	I mean, Terry was a salesman.
311	00:22:26	00:22:29	You listened to him talk for five minutes and your hair was on fire.
312	00:22:29	00:22:32	Ms. Gallagher, your skate had a certain blood spatter on it.
313	00:22:32	00:22:36	It indicates that you're the one that nicked Terry River's carotid artery.
314	00:22:37	00:22:38	Look, it was pileup.
315	00:22:40	00:22:42	Everything was a blur.
316	00:22:42	00:22:43	That's ten guys with blades on.
317	00:22:43	00:22:45	Hey, I was just looking out for myself.
318	00:22:45	00:22:47	He was a stationary target.
319	00:22:47	00:22:49	Terry was on the bottom of all those bodies.
320	00:22:49	00:22:54	Like you said nobody saw anything. Including your skate intentionally coming down on his neck.
321	00:22:54	00:22:56	Oh, God.
322	00:22:57	00:22:59	You okay?
323	00:22:59	00:23:01	You all right?
324	00:23:01	00:23:05	I knew I shouldn't have had that shrimp salad for dinner last night.
325	00:23:05	00:23:11	If you'll excuse me I'll get that cleaned up.
326	00:23:14	00:23:16	Wait, you're not going to...
327	00:23:16	00:23:18	What are you doing?
328	00:23:18	00:23:20	It's evidence.
329	00:23:20	00:23:25	Food poisoning especially anything with spoiled mayonnaise can induce vomiting within 15 minutes.
330	00:23:25	00:23:29	She said last night-- that was 12 hours ago.
331	00:23:36	00:23:38	She's a liar, and a mother.
332	00:23:38	00:23:40	Morning sickness?
333	00:23:40	00:23:41	Yep.
334	00:23:41	00:23:43	And you know this how?
335	00:23:43	00:23:46	Well, first I tested for the presence of shellfish-- crustacean free.
336	00:23:46	00:23:49	And then I figured if she's hiding that what else is she hiding?
337	00:23:49	00:23:51	Little lie, big lie.
338	00:23:51	00:23:53	There was blood in the sample.
339	00:23:53	00:23:55	Not uncommon in early pregnancy.
340	00:23:55	00:23:59	Women get mucosal tears in their esophagus because they yak so much.
341	00:24:00	00:24:04	So, I tested the blood for the presence of human choriogonadotropins.
342	00:24:04	00:24:06	She is definitely with child.
343	00:24:06	00:24:08	She wasn't showing. She's skinny as a rail.
344	00:24:08	00:24:10	But...
345	00:24:10	00:24:11	still, why lie about it?
346	00:24:11	00:24:13	Maybe she didn't know she was pregnant.
347	00:24:13	00:24:16	If she had, would she have gone out on the ice?
348	00:24:16	00:24:20	I wonder if she would know who the father is... or was.
349	00:24:20	00:24:23	Well, if it was Terry Rivers he was definitely deadbeat dad material.
350	00:24:23	00:24:25	Which speaks to motive.
351	00:24:25	00:24:27	It's enough to get us a warrant.
352	00:24:27	00:24:30	Except you can't safely test for paternity before the baby's born.
353	00:24:30	00:24:32	We could search Jane Gallagher's apartment.
354	00:24:32	00:24:35	See if Terry Rivers might have left anything behind.
355	00:24:35	00:24:39	Yeah. Say goodbye to Greg.
356	00:24:39	00:24:41	Bye, Greg.
357	00:24:43	00:24:50	I've got twins here, Bill-- one set of prints from your work card; another set from the drug paraphernalia we found in the Dumpster.
358	00:24:50	00:24:52	Look, what can I say?
359	00:24:52	00:24:53	He's got a son.
360	00:24:53	00:24:54	Well, that's fine.
361	00:24:54	00:24:56	That's not the issue.
362	00:24:56	00:24:58	You tampered with the evidence.
363	00:24:58	00:24:59	He's eight years old.
364	00:24:59	00:25:02	I didn't want Stan's son to hear that he died in a lounge.
365	00:25:02	00:25:05	Foam coming out of his mouth a needle in his arm.
366	00:25:05	00:25:06	That's too much for a boy.
367	00:25:06	00:25:07	Yeah, but you got him the gig.
368	00:25:07	00:25:10	You didn't know he was a junkie?
369	00:25:10	00:25:11	So am I.
370	00:25:11	00:25:13	Former.
371	00:25:13	00:25:14	Hell, we met in A.A.
372	00:25:14	00:25:16	I thought he was clean.
373	00:25:16	00:25:18	I got my fourth birthday coming up.
374	00:25:18	00:25:20	Could have lost your job.
375	00:25:20	00:25:22	Besides, Lillie's going places.
376	00:25:22	00:25:24	You know, she's on her way up.
377	00:25:24	00:25:26	I want to be along for the ride.
378	00:25:26	00:25:30	So, you cleaned him up, threw away his works...
379	00:25:30	00:25:31	Why Lillie's scarf?
380	00:25:31	00:25:33	I grabbed the first thing I could find.
381	00:25:33	00:25:35	Lillie's scarf was there?
382	00:25:35	00:25:36	Yeah. Really?
383	00:25:37	00:25:38	You mind rolling up your sleeves for us?
384	00:25:50	00:25:51	I've always had good veins.
385	00:25:51	00:25:54	Yeah, okay.
386	00:25:55	00:25:57	Thanks.
387	00:25:57	00:26:00	Hey, one more thing, Bill.
388	00:26:00	00:26:01	You wear contacts?
389	00:26:02	00:26:03	Not anymore.
390	00:26:03	00:26:04	Lasik surgery.
391	00:26:04	00:26:05	How's that working out for you?
392	00:26:05	00:26:06	Great.
393	00:26:06	00:26:08	One less thing I'm dependent on.
394	00:26:45	00:26:46	No, no, no, no.
395	00:26:46	00:26:47	Don't stop.
396	00:26:47	00:26:51	I don't like playing in front of an audience.
397	00:26:51	00:26:52	It's just me.
398	00:26:53	00:26:56	What, are you uncomfortable in front of strangers or something?
399	00:26:56	00:27:00	No, I just came by to ask you a few questions and I got a little carried away.
400	00:27:00	00:27:03	Oh.
401	00:27:03	00:27:08	Well, if you keep playing I'll keep talking.
402	00:27:24	00:27:27	So, um, how well do you know these people you play with?
403	00:27:27	00:27:28	Oh...
404	00:27:28	00:27:31	well enough.
405	00:27:37	00:27:38	Who is this?
406	00:27:38	00:27:43	I thought I was the one asking questions here.
407	00:27:46	00:27:47	Warrick Brown.
408	00:27:50	00:27:52	Lillie Ivers.
409	00:27:54	00:27:56	So, I guess we're not strangers anymore.
410	00:28:00	00:28:05	Maybe you should come by later...
411	00:28:05	00:28:07	so we can talk some more.
412	00:28:11	00:28:17	Well, Jane may play hockey but her sheets are distinctly female.
413	00:28:17	00:28:19	There are semen stains everywhere.
414	00:28:19	00:28:20	Not very Victoria Secret.
415	00:28:20	00:28:24	What is Victoria's Secret, I wonder?
416	00:28:24	00:28:26	Beauty, Grissom.
417	00:28:26	00:28:27	Remember?
418	00:28:43	00:28:47	Sheets may be female, but this toenail belonged to a man.
419	00:28:47	00:28:51	With all the sex these people are having maybe I should take up hockey.
420	00:28:57	00:28:59	I told you what I make.
421	00:28:59	00:29:00	What do you bring in?
422	00:29:01	00:29:02	50, 60 a year?
423	00:29:02	00:29:04	So, that's what you're all about?
424	00:29:04	00:29:06	No, that's what the business is all about.
425	00:29:06	00:29:07	Then run.
426	00:29:07	00:29:10	Hmm.
427	00:29:10	00:29:14	I just thought that with your kind of talent you know, I could dial you in.
428	00:29:14	00:29:19	I've got a manager with a pipeline to God.
429	00:29:19	00:29:21	Sounds like you're pretty dependent on him.
430	00:29:21	00:29:26	I've been booked solid for the past two years.
431	00:29:26	00:29:31	Next stop... Blue Note, Motown...
432	00:29:31	00:29:32	anything I want.
433	00:29:32	00:29:35	Studio time, recording contracts...
434	00:29:35	00:29:36	Great.
435	00:29:36	00:29:39	I'm a musician, Warrick, and I recognize talent.
436	00:29:41	00:29:43	And the way you look...
437	00:29:43	00:29:47	you might as well be dipped in gold.
438	00:29:47	00:29:48	I don't know about all that.
439	00:29:48	00:29:50	What are you holding back for?
440	00:29:52	00:29:55	You could be out there making a difference.
441	00:29:55	00:29:57	I already do make a difference.
442	00:29:57	00:30:00	Yeah, riding around chasing ghosts with that partner of yours.
443	00:30:00	00:30:02	Nobody even knows you exist.
444	00:30:02	00:30:04	You do.
445	00:30:06	00:30:08	Show time.
446	00:30:08	00:30:09	We're back.
447	00:30:09	00:30:10	Okay.
448	00:30:13	00:30:14	Okay, so...
449	00:30:14	00:30:15	Knock 'em dead.
450	00:30:16	00:30:17	I'll try.
451	00:30:46	00:30:47	Catherine...
452	00:30:48	00:30:50	you seen any guys with a broken tooth lately?
453	00:30:50	00:30:51	Yeah, I saw ten of them.
454	00:30:51	00:30:53	Yeah, well, one of them is your suspect.
455	00:30:53	00:30:55	I got your page. What's the big news?
456	00:30:55	00:30:57	Oh, that tooth that you found at the bottom of the snow pile...
457	00:30:57	00:30:58	You got a match. To what?
458	00:30:58	00:31:00	To the nasty-ass toenail that Sara found.
459	00:31:00	00:31:02	What? I thought it belonged to the dead guy.
460	00:31:02	00:31:04	No, it belongs to a live guy.
461	00:31:04	00:31:10	So, what you're saying is whoever was in Jane Gallagher's bed was on the ice the night that Terry Rivers died.
462	00:31:10	00:31:11	Goal.
463	00:31:11	00:31:12	It's a temp.
464	00:31:12	00:31:16	What about the girl? Is she a temp, too?
465	00:31:16	00:31:20	You know, I treated Jane better than that mutt Rivers ever did.
466	00:31:20	00:31:22	And it never cost her a cent.
467	00:31:22	00:31:24	Is that why you hated Terry?
468	00:31:24	00:31:26	He was on my short list, yeah.
469	00:31:26	00:31:27	You know, I got a list.
470	00:31:27	00:31:30	It's got a negative figure of 12,000 after your name.
471	00:31:30	00:31:33	Well, money's kind of like my tooth.
472	00:31:33	00:31:35	It don't grow back.
473	00:31:35	00:31:39	Did you ever hear the story of the 19th century Chinese goldsmith?
474	00:31:39	00:31:49	He lost a lot of money for his goldsmith buddies due to his shoddy business practices so they decided to kill him by biting him to death.
475	00:31:49	00:31:54	123 goldsmiths took a bite out of the victim insuring that no one individual could be blamed for the murder.
476	00:31:54	00:31:57	For who would know which one administered the lethal bite.
477	00:31:58	00:32:00	You're the captain of the rat pack.
478	00:32:00	00:32:04	You make it so everyone gets a shot in and no one takes the blame-- it's a win-win situation.
479	00:32:04	00:32:09	Well, it's a nice little bedtime story for your kids but it doesn't have a lick of truth.
480	00:32:11	00:32:13	your friend Jane is pregnant.
481	00:32:13	00:32:17	I'm going to be a dad?
482	00:32:20	00:32:23	What kind of coronary anomaly?
483	00:32:23	00:32:25	Wolff-Parkinson -White Syndrome.
484	00:32:25	00:32:27	Interferes with the heart's electrical system.
485	00:32:27	00:32:28	I never heard of it.
486	00:32:28	00:32:33	Well, it didn't show during the post but I looked at the tissue sections in histopath.
487	00:32:33	00:32:37	They showed a small defect in the atrium of the heart.
488	00:32:40	00:32:42	So, the game had nothing to do with it?
489	00:32:42	00:32:43	It was the heart?
490	00:32:43	00:32:44	Not necessarily.
491	00:32:44	00:32:47	You know the quinine I found in his system?
492	00:32:47	00:32:49	Lethal for someone with W.P.W.
493	00:32:49	00:32:51	Big scars didn't do him in.
494	00:32:51	00:32:53	It was the little scar.
495	00:32:53	00:32:56	Someone still gets an assist.
496	00:33:05	00:33:07	Hey, Sara.
497	00:33:07	00:33:10	If you come up here on your nights off people are going to start confusing the two of you.
498	00:33:10	00:33:12	You're here.
499	00:33:14	00:33:16	What's up?
500	00:33:16	00:33:18	New lead.
501	00:33:18	00:33:19	The bartender.
502	00:33:20	00:33:21	Purple.
503	00:33:21	00:33:23	Marquis Mecke Froede.
504	00:33:23	00:33:25	Test for opiates.
505	00:33:34	00:33:35	Purple.
506	00:33:35	00:33:37	You know what that means.
507	00:33:39	00:33:43	The coasters test positive for heroin.
508	00:33:43	00:33:46	He sandwiched the drugs between the coasters.
509	00:33:46	00:33:48	That's how he hid it.
510	00:33:48	00:33:51	He was dealing from behind the bar.
511	00:33:51	00:33:57	When we found those two coasters in Stan Grevey's dressing room we assumed that there was two people-- either a user or supplier.
512	00:33:57	00:33:58	There weren't.
513	00:33:59	00:34:01	Just our guy-- the victim.
514	00:34:04	00:34:06	What's wrong?
515	00:34:06	00:34:10	He wasn't the only one with two coasters, man.
516	00:34:11	00:34:13	What do you mean?
517	00:34:13	00:34:16	Remember when we talked to Lillie about the scarf?
518	00:34:16	00:34:17	Yeah?
519	00:34:17	00:34:20	She had a drink with two coasters.
520	00:34:20	00:34:22	So what?
521	00:34:22	00:34:24	There could be a hundred reasons why she...
522	00:34:24	00:34:25	Did you not hear me?
523	00:34:25	00:34:26	She might be involved.
524	00:34:26	00:34:27	You got to walk away from this fast.
525	00:34:28	00:34:29	We got the dealer-- the bartender.
526	00:34:29	00:34:30	Let's just take him out.
527	00:34:30	00:34:31	And we will.
528	00:34:31	00:34:33	What about her?
529	00:34:33	00:34:34	What about her?
530	00:34:34	00:34:36	Why don't you...
531	00:34:36	00:34:39	Why don't you just let me handle my business.
532	00:34:39	00:34:40	Then handle it.
533	00:34:47	00:34:49	We were in the sack.
534	00:34:49	00:34:51	Right in the middle of it.
535	00:34:51	00:34:53	Next thing I know, he stopped...
536	00:34:53	00:34:55	How do I say this?
537	00:34:55	00:34:56	He stopped...
538	00:34:56	00:34:57	Doing it?
539	00:34:58	00:34:58	Yes. Thank you.
540	00:34:59	00:35:00	His face was flushed.
541	00:35:00	00:35:01	He was sweating.
542	00:35:01	00:35:03	It was all good, and then he just...
543	00:35:07	00:35:10	He went soft and passed out.
544	00:35:11	00:35:13	I was scared. I called the team doctor.
545	00:35:13	00:35:16	The paramedics came and rushed him to the E.R.
546	00:35:16	00:35:18	You know we got his medical records.
547	00:35:18	00:35:20	Let me ask you a question.
548	00:35:20	00:35:23	When Terry came to did he tell you what had happened to him?
549	00:35:23	00:35:25	He didn't tell me anything.
550	00:35:25	00:35:27	Neither did the doctors.
551	00:35:27	00:35:28	I wasn't family.
552	00:35:28	00:35:29	What did you do?
553	00:35:29	00:35:30	Took off.
554	00:35:30	00:35:33	I didn't want anybody to know I'd been with him.
555	00:35:33	00:35:38	Worried that the father of your child might find out?
556	00:35:43	00:35:47	I was sleeping with Terry but I was dating Tommy.
557	00:35:47	00:35:50	And what's the difference?
558	00:35:50	00:35:52	Terry was a bad boy.
559	00:35:52	00:35:55	The kind of guy you just can't get out of your system.
560	00:35:55	00:35:57	Who's on your mind all the time.
561	00:35:57	00:36:02	He used to drive my friends crazy.
562	00:36:02	00:36:06	Tommy... husband material.
563	00:36:09	00:36:13	So we just double-checked the search warrant returned from Terry Rivers apartment.
564	00:36:13	00:36:15	There was no quinine found in the location.
565	00:36:15	00:36:17	He never had a prescription for quinine.
566	00:36:17	00:36:20	Well, according to Doc Robbins he never had malaria.
567	00:36:20	00:36:22	Do you have his medical file?
568	00:36:22	00:36:23	Yeah.
569	00:36:23	00:36:25	Let me see it.
570	00:36:25	00:36:27	Right here.
571	00:36:27	00:36:30	So Jane Gallagher is officially no longer a suspect.
572	00:36:30	00:36:33	Didn't have access to quinine let alone know it would kill him.
573	00:36:33	00:36:34	So who did know?
574	00:36:34	00:36:36	Terry was a roughneck.
575	00:36:36	00:36:40	He dished it out so the other players dished it out harder.
576	00:36:40	00:36:42	Which they wouldn't have done if they had known about his heart.
577	00:36:42	00:36:44	They would have played tentatively.
578	00:36:44	00:36:47	Which in hockey is a sacrilege.
579	00:36:47	00:36:49	Someone besides Terry had to know.
580	00:36:50	00:36:51	Somebody did.
581	00:36:51	00:36:58	You can withhold medical information from your friends all you want but it's still going to be in your hospital record.
582	00:36:58	00:37:02	Anyone with access to Terry's medical records knew how to kill him.
583	00:37:03	00:37:06	How many patients do you have with malaria?
584	00:37:06	00:37:08	I'm an orthopedist. None.
585	00:37:08	00:37:11	Not according to the pharmacy in your medical building.
586	00:37:11	00:37:16	Last month you wrote a prescription for quinine-- an anti-malaria medication.
587	00:37:16	00:37:17	Malaria in Las Vegas.
588	00:37:18	00:37:20	No wonder they were out of stock.
589	00:37:20	00:37:21	Look, a friend of mine was going to Africa.
590	00:37:21	00:37:23	I did him a favor. That's it.
591	00:37:23	00:37:25	Now, is there a crime in that?
592	00:37:25	00:37:29	Well... a man is dead.
593	00:37:34	00:37:37	It hurts getting stitched.
594	00:37:37	00:37:39	It hurts even more when you get home.
595	00:37:39	00:37:41	I always give the guys something for the pain.
596	00:37:41	00:37:43	So you're the go-to guy?
597	00:37:43	00:37:46	I am the on-site doctor for this facility.
598	00:37:46	00:37:48	Nothing more and nothing less.
599	00:37:48	00:37:50	Is this Umbria or Tuscany?
600	00:37:51	00:37:53	Italy.
601	00:37:53	00:37:54	That's pretty serious.
602	00:37:57	00:38:02	But Jane's had a couple of boyfriends since that trip, right?
603	00:38:14	00:38:17	Terry was an injury waiting to happen, wasn't he?
604	00:38:17	00:38:22	And when it did you were there on the bench with two little pills in your hand.
605	00:38:32	00:38:34	So what?
606	00:38:34	00:38:36	So what if I gave him quinine?
607	00:38:36	00:38:39	It's like giving a candy bar to a diabetic if you know he's a diabetic.
608	00:38:39	00:38:41	And you knew, Doctor.
609	00:38:41	00:38:44	Terry Rivers had a heart condition.
610	00:38:48	00:38:49	I need you.
611	00:38:49	00:38:51	Oh, yeah, since when?
612	00:38:51	00:38:53	Look, we tried it out, it didn't work.
613	00:38:53	00:38:54	We're friends.
614	00:38:54	00:38:57	I don't want the whole world to know that I've been with Terry.
615	00:38:59	00:39:00	Please?
616	00:39:02	00:39:05	Okay, okay. I'll stay with Terry.
617	00:39:05	00:39:09	You were always cleaning up her messes weren't you, Doctor?
618	00:39:09	00:39:12	Jane told us she paid you a visit a couple of days ago.
619	00:39:12	00:39:15	She thought she had the flu... but she didn't.
620	00:39:15	00:39:17	She's pregnant.
621	00:39:17	00:39:22	And with the father out of the way you knew who she would turn to.
622	00:39:22	00:39:26	But Tommy Sconzo is the father.
623	00:39:29	00:39:32	You killed the wrong guy.
624	00:39:36	00:39:39	Let's take a little drive.
625	00:39:54	00:39:55	You're nearsighted?
626	00:39:55	00:40:00	I bet this is going to match the contact lens we found at the crime scene.
627	00:40:02	00:40:04	Let me ask you another question.
628	00:40:04	00:40:06	Why deal 91% pure China White?
629	00:40:06	00:40:10	Did you have a beef with the victim, or what?
630	00:40:10	00:40:12	I never met the guy.
631	00:40:12	00:40:14	You're going to have to do better than that.
632	00:40:14	00:40:19	You intentionally sold him stuff that was too pure.
633	00:40:19	00:40:21	We know he's not the only guy you dealt it to.
634	00:40:22	00:40:25	Look, I didn't mean to harm anybody, all right?
635	00:40:25	00:40:27	I didn't know what I was cutting.
636	00:40:27	00:40:28	Probably got a bad batch.
637	00:40:29	00:40:31	Bad batch?
638	00:40:31	00:40:35	Hey, do yourself a favor, slick.
639	00:40:35	00:40:38	If you don't know enough about something stay out of it.
640	00:40:38	00:40:40	It's too late for that.
641	00:40:47	00:40:49	You want to talk about it?
642	00:40:49	00:40:51	No.
643	00:40:51	00:40:53	Okay.
644	00:40:53	00:40:54	I'm going to meet Lillie.
645	00:40:54	00:40:56	I'll see you back at the lab.
646	00:40:59	00:41:00	You don't know me.
647	00:41:06	00:41:08	Obviously.
648	00:41:08	00:41:11	You hiding from me?
649	00:41:13	00:41:15	Are you looking for me?
650	00:41:15	00:41:17	Yeah.
651	00:41:17	00:41:19	I wanted to talk to you.
652	00:41:19	00:41:22	Oh, yeah?
653	00:41:22	00:41:24	About what?
654	00:41:28	00:41:29	Come on, tell me.
655	00:41:29	00:41:31	We're not strangers anymore, remember?
656	00:41:33	00:41:34	Yeah, you're right.
657	00:41:37	00:41:40	Warrick Brown.
658	00:41:44	00:41:46	What?
659	00:41:55	00:41:58	I'm sorry, Lillie.
660	00:42:00	00:42:04	Life's too short.
661	00:42:06	00:42:08	Good-bye.
662	00:43:29	00:43:31	What are you doing here?
663	00:43:31	00:43:33	I'm playing cards...
664	00:43:35	00:43:38	with my friend.
