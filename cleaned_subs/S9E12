0	00:01:40	00:01:42	Open the door, please.
1	00:01:42	00:01:44	Come on, open up.
2	00:01:44	00:01:47	Come on, man, please!
3	00:01:47	00:01:48	Open the door!
4	00:01:52	00:01:54	Oh...
5	00:02:10	00:02:11	Whoa.
6	00:02:47	00:02:49	You seen The Incredible Hulk?
7	00:02:50	00:02:51	This dude was this big, man.
8	00:02:51	00:02:54	And he comes out like that, but he was all red.
9	00:02:54	00:02:57	And he comes out, and he gets in his car...
10	00:03:01	00:03:03	Three detectives for one homicide?
11	00:03:03	00:03:04	Callout was for an officer down.
12	00:03:05	00:03:07	Usually brings in more help than we need.
13	00:03:07	00:03:09	Don't believe they're LVPD.
14	00:03:09	00:03:12	He was kicking this door, and he was pounding...
15	00:03:12	00:03:14	David? Hey.
16	00:03:14	00:03:16	Um, there's not much room in there.
17	00:03:16	00:03:18	I'm more than happy to wait.
18	00:04:04	00:04:07	Catherine, this man's arm is gone.
19	00:04:07	00:04:10	No, it isn't.
20	00:04:12	00:04:15	Tissue is ragged.
21	00:04:17	00:04:19	It's not dismembered, it's disarticulated.
22	00:04:19	00:04:22	Takes an awful lot of rage to tear a man's arm off.
23	00:04:22	00:04:24	Or an awful lot of PCP.
24	00:04:26	00:04:28	Try not to get too far ahead of the evidence.
25	00:04:36	00:04:38	Department of Justice.
26	00:04:39	00:04:41	Actually, he's FBI.
27	00:04:41	00:04:44	Meet Agent William Ray Hatford.
28	00:04:44	00:04:46	So those suits you were talking to...?
29	00:04:46	00:04:48	Yeah, they're all in from D.C. on a case.
30	00:04:48	00:04:52	They stopped here to get gas, Agent Hatford came in to take a leak, never came out.
31	00:04:52	00:04:54	They found him like this.
32	00:04:54	00:04:57	They notified their field office, and then they called us.
33	00:04:57	00:04:58	They acknowledged our jurisdiction.
34	00:04:58	00:05:00	That's refreshing.
35	00:05:00	00:05:03	Yeah, whoever did this took his gun, his badge and his wallet.
36	00:05:03	00:05:05	I mean, this doesn't feel like a simple robbery.
37	00:05:08	00:05:10	He's supposed to get ahead of the evidence.
38	00:05:14	00:05:17	So I'm gonna take the agents down to the station, get their statements.
39	00:05:17	00:05:18	They're kind of shook up.
40	00:05:18	00:05:20	Feds are human, too, I guess.
41	00:05:32	00:05:38	Ray, I know you're not doing what it looks like you're doing, so what are you doing?
42	00:05:38	00:05:40	This man lost more than an arm.
43	00:05:40	00:05:46	The stoner outside said a big red hulk did this.
44	00:05:47	00:05:50	Maybe he was right.
45	00:07:04	00:07:06	I don't think this hunk of flesh came from him.
46	00:07:06	00:07:08	Maybe it came from the killer.
47	00:07:08	00:07:11	There are no defensive wounds on the victim's body suggesting a sign of struggle.
48	00:07:11	00:07:13	Maybe it came from another victim.
49	00:07:13	00:07:17	Witness on the scene didn't mention anyone else.
50	00:07:17	00:07:21	Another argument for DNA.
51	00:07:21	00:07:24	All right, I'll call PD and have them check all the hospitals.
52	00:07:24	00:07:26	I'll get his prints.
53	00:07:26	00:07:28	Actually, would you mind if I did that?
54	00:07:28	00:07:29	Not at all.
55	00:08:01	00:08:03	Um, is-is there a problem?
56	00:08:06	00:08:08	Actually, there is a problem.
57	00:08:09	00:08:13	There's no ridge detail on any of his fingertips. See?
58	00:08:13	00:08:15	This looks surgical.
59	00:08:15	00:08:17	Maybe microdermabrasion.
60	00:08:21	00:08:24	What kind of FBI agent doesn't have fingerprints?
61	00:08:24	00:08:27	Agent Hatford had been working undercover for several years.
62	00:08:27	00:08:29	His fingerprints were removed as a security measure.
63	00:08:29	00:08:32	See, these days, the bad guys can run prints, too.
64	00:08:32	00:08:34	They've seen Donnie Brasco.
65	00:08:35	00:08:36	They know how we work.
66	00:08:36	00:08:39	Well, I presume the Bureau requires a confirmed ID.
67	00:08:39	00:08:40	That's the procedure.
68	00:08:40	00:08:42	Since we don't have fingerprints, we'll have to run DNA.
69	00:08:42	00:08:46	I'll get an STR profile to Quantico for verification as soon as possible.
70	00:08:46	00:08:47	Fine.
71	00:08:47	00:08:49	Where are you on a suspect?
72	00:08:49	00:08:55	Oh, well, right now all we have is the eyewitness report of a guy who looked like the Incredible Red Hulk.
73	00:08:55	00:08:59	But CSI's got some surveillance video from the gas station, and they're analyzing it now.
74	00:08:59	00:09:02	Is it possible that this case is somehow connected to the case you're working on?
75	00:09:02	00:09:04	Of course it's possible.
76	00:09:04	00:09:06	We work with scumbags every day.
77	00:09:06	00:09:07	Like who?
78	00:09:07	00:09:10	If I had a name, I wouldn't be standing here.
79	00:09:11	00:09:15	Agent Stanley, would you give us a moment alone?
80	00:09:15	00:09:17	Please?
81	00:09:23	00:09:24	How long have you two been working together?
82	00:09:24	00:09:26	It feels like forever.
83	00:09:28	00:09:30	All of our active files are at our command post.
84	00:09:30	00:09:34	I can assure you, Captain, you will have the full cooperation of the FBI.
85	00:09:34	00:09:36	Great.
86	00:09:36	00:09:42	All right, that is Agent Hatford making his last trip to the can.
87	00:09:46	00:09:50	And that is a class two misdemeanor.
88	00:09:50	00:09:55	Well, the FBI does not concern itself with state fire codes, Greggo.
89	00:09:56	00:09:57	Okay...
90	00:09:57	00:09:59	almost there...
91	00:10:00	00:10:01	Now.
92	00:10:04	00:10:07	Take a look at the mirror.
93	00:10:13	00:10:15	Looks like a vintage muscle car.
94	00:10:17	00:10:20	And that face...
95	00:10:20	00:10:22	It's a bloody mess.
96	00:10:22	00:10:23	Yeah, you should've seen the bathroom.
97	00:10:23	00:10:26	I'll have Brass put out a broadcast.
98	00:10:28	00:10:30	Investigation's been focused on human trafficking.
99	00:10:30	00:10:36	Underage women in the Vegas sex trade, smuggled in from South America, Brazil, primarily.
100	00:10:36	00:10:39	Yeah, there's been a little chatter about that on the streets.
101	00:10:39	00:10:40	But, uh, nothing really concrete.
102	00:10:41	00:10:42	They've only been operating for a few months.
103	00:10:42	00:10:46	Low key, select clientele, contacted directly by email only.
104	00:10:46	00:10:50	Agent Hatford was on source-targeting and recruitment.
105	00:10:51	00:10:53	He did most of our field interviews.
106	00:10:53	00:10:56	Hookers, pimps, mid-level scumbags.
107	00:10:59	00:11:01	We're just starting to put the network together.
108	00:11:02	00:11:04	Who'd you piss off to pull this duty?
109	00:11:04	00:11:06	This is important work. We requested this.
110	00:11:06	00:11:10	Homeland Security gets lion's share of the Bureau's resources these days.
111	00:11:10	00:11:16	What do you think, we just run around and chase terrorists, spy on Americans, and investigate paranormal activity, is that it?
112	00:11:16	00:11:18	Sorry.
113	00:11:18	00:11:20	No offense intended.
114	00:11:21	00:11:23	I hope your taxes are in order.
115	00:11:23	00:11:25	I think you just bought yourself an audit.
116	00:11:26	00:11:29	Our case files and suspect interviews.
117	00:11:29	00:11:32	Anybody in there with the physical strength to do what was done to Agent Hatford?
118	00:11:32	00:11:34	I doubt it.
119	00:11:34	00:11:36	Did Agent Hatford wear a wire?
120	00:11:36	00:11:37	Sometimes.
121	00:11:37	00:11:39	I don't know if those tapes were transcribed yet.
122	00:11:44	00:11:46	We haven't been able to ID the head of the operation.
123	00:11:46	00:11:52	He's referred to on the street as Os Punho, which is Portuguese for The Fist.
124	00:11:56	00:11:58	Anybody look familiar?
125	00:11:59	00:12:01	I don't know.
126	00:12:05	00:12:09	Gradual application of dry heat is generally the best way to bring a muscle out of rigor.
127	00:12:10	00:12:13	And the man can cook.
128	00:12:13	00:12:16	What are we having for dinner?
129	00:12:16	00:12:21	This muscle has two heads and a shared, single point of insertion.
130	00:12:21	00:12:25	Judging from size and weight, uh, we can rule out Biceps femoris.
131	00:12:25	00:12:29	Biceps brachii, then.
132	00:12:29	00:12:31	The tissue is clearly infected.
133	00:12:31	00:12:33	In fact, it looks necrotic.
134	00:12:33	00:12:36	What do you make of these, uh, linear streaks?
135	00:12:36	00:12:38	Well, I think they're hemorrhage lines.
136	00:12:38	00:12:40	I bet this guy was shooting steroids.
137	00:12:40	00:12:42	With a dirty needle?
138	00:12:42	00:12:47	That seems pretty stupid, even for somebody stupid enough to kill an FBI agent.
139	00:12:47	00:12:49	I guess he neglected to swab his skin.
140	00:12:49	00:12:53	Contaminants could've been pushed in with the injection.
141	00:12:53	00:12:55	The muscle looks like it fell right off the bone.
142	00:12:55	00:12:57	Like a piece of well-cooked chicken.
143	00:12:59	00:13:02	You know, I found some pieces of mirror glass inside the muscle.
144	00:13:02	00:13:08	(screaming) Maybe this guy was in so much pain that he had to rip it out right then and there.
145	00:13:08	00:13:11	You listening to me, Vinnie? I asked you a question.
146	00:13:11	00:13:13	What are you doing on Hill Street?
147	00:13:13	00:13:16	Agent Hatford taped this interview the night before he was killed.
148	00:13:16	00:13:18	I guess those muscles make you deaf and dumb, huh?
149	00:13:18	00:13:20	The suspect at the gas station was heavily muscled.
150	00:13:20	00:13:22	Which is why I figured this could be the guy.
151	00:13:22	00:13:24	Oh, don't eyeball me like that, Vinnie.
152	00:13:24	00:13:26	I am the F-B-friggin'-I, are you feelin' me?
153	00:13:26	00:13:29	Now put your hands on the hood.
154	00:13:32	00:13:36	We know about all those little sweet ass Brazilian hos you be running.
155	00:13:36	00:13:37	And we don't like it.
156	00:13:37	00:13:38	But you know who bothers us more?
157	00:13:39	00:13:40	That armpit you work for.
158	00:13:40	00:13:41	That sewer rat.
159	00:13:41	00:13:43	Where is he?
160	00:13:43	00:13:44	How would I know?
161	00:13:44	00:13:45	I don't work for no one.
162	00:13:45	00:13:47	Os Punho.
163	00:13:47	00:13:49	You don't know who I'm talking about? The Fist?
164	00:13:49	00:13:52	You tellin' me you know nothin' about The Fist?
165	00:13:52	00:13:54	How would you like a fist up your...
166	00:13:54	00:13:58	Unfortunately, Vinnie was only referred to as Vinnie.
167	00:13:58	00:13:59	No last name.
168	00:13:59	00:14:02	And Agent Hatford never had a chance to write up a full report.
169	00:14:02	00:14:05	Tox on your orphaned biceps.
170	00:14:05	00:14:10	Nandrolone decanoate, methenolone enanthate, oxymetholone, and HCG.
171	00:14:10	00:14:12	That's quite a cocktail.
172	00:14:12	00:14:15	Maybe this Vinnie is a bodybuilder.
173	00:14:15	00:14:16	It could be.
174	00:14:16	00:14:20	This specific mix was very popular with the local weight- lifting community a while back.
175	00:14:20	00:14:23	The VELCORE Lab was supplying it to all sorts of athletes.
176	00:14:23	00:14:24	Before we shut them down.
177	00:14:24	00:14:27	You know, there is someone who's very familiar with this case.
178	00:14:27	00:14:29	And he's real easy to get to.
179	00:14:29	00:14:32	He's a murder suspect, he's using your juice.
180	00:14:32	00:14:34	His name is Vinnie.
181	00:14:34	00:14:38	If you know his last name, we'd appreciate the information.
182	00:14:38	00:14:41	Let me get this straight.
183	00:14:41	00:15:03	You guys bust my company for selling roids, give everybody else a chance to plead out for easy time so the D.A. can make an example out of me, because I'm-- me personally-- I'm corrupting the very fabric of American sports.
184	00:15:03	00:15:06	You ruin my life.
185	00:15:06	00:15:09	And now you want me to help you?
186	00:15:09	00:15:11	That pretty much sums it up, yeah.
187	00:15:11	00:15:12	Screw you.
188	00:15:12	00:15:15	Yeah, I figured you'd have an adverse reaction to that.
189	00:15:15	00:15:24	I've only got 22 days left of a 16-month rap, which means there is nothing you can do for me or to me.
190	00:15:24	00:15:28	Yeah, that's why I decided to bring in an associate.
191	00:15:28	00:15:30	Agent Bechman, would you come in here, please?
192	00:15:38	00:15:40	You work much with federal agents?
193	00:15:40	00:15:42	Actually, this is my first time.
194	00:15:42	00:15:43	I'm a CSI-1.
195	00:15:44	00:15:47	Were you held back?
196	00:15:47	00:15:49	Career change.
197	00:15:52	00:15:54	I was a physician.
198	00:15:55	00:15:58	And screw you, too, Fed.
199	00:15:58	00:16:03	I... would prefer to just educate you.
200	00:16:03	00:16:23	For instance, did you know that many people convicted of drug offenses continue to engage in some form of drug trade while in prison?
201	00:16:23	00:16:39	Now, United States v. Delgado held that if you so much as speak to someone for the purpose of dealing drugs, even while incarcerated, that's Conspiracy to Conduct a Racketeering Enterprise.
202	00:16:39	00:16:42	Doesn't matter whether or not you handed out the drugs.
203	00:16:42	00:16:47	Your business activities from prison violate the RICO statute.
204	00:16:47	00:16:54	Even if I did something like that-- and I am not saying that I did-- I already got busted for it.
205	00:16:54	00:16:56	That is double jeopardy.
206	00:16:56	00:16:58	Not according to Garrett v. United States.
207	00:16:58	00:17:07	The double jeopardy clause does not bar cumulative punishments for continuing criminal enterprises and underlying predicate offenses.
208	00:17:07	00:17:09	Your man knows the law.
209	00:17:09	00:17:11	That's our Miles.
210	00:17:11	00:17:42	If we determine that you do have some information regarding this suspect which you choose not to share, then I can promise that the full weight of the Department of Justice and RICO section 1963 will be brought to bear upon you, and your 22 days in Clark County Prison will become 20 years in a federal penitentiary.
211	00:17:42	00:17:45	Oh, and we get to take everything you own.
212	00:17:51	00:17:54	His name's Vinnie Mingus.
213	00:17:54	00:17:58	He's one of those Supreme Force Fighters.
214	00:17:58	00:18:01	He's supposed to be fighting today.
215	00:18:11	00:18:12	Yeah!
216	00:18:26	00:18:28	Well, it sure ain't the Mandalay Bay.
217	00:18:29	00:18:30	Welcome to human cockfighting.
218	00:18:30	00:18:32	Man, this is as real as it gets.
219	00:18:32	00:18:39	It's like a bar fight spilled out into the alleyway. Like the Marquis of Queensberry, I prefer boxing-- the sweet science.
220	00:18:39	00:18:42	There's Mingus.
221	00:18:42	00:18:44	Somebody around here must have seen him.
222	00:18:44	00:18:46	Let's take a look around.
223	00:19:02	00:19:04	Yeah.
224	00:19:04	00:19:05	Scotch, rocks.
225	00:19:10	00:19:11	Vinnie, please.
226	00:19:11	00:19:12	You've got to sit down.
227	00:19:13	00:19:15	Get out of my way!
228	00:19:26	00:19:29	Hey, Brass, I got him.
229	00:19:31	00:19:34	Didn't I get the message across with the last guy?
230	00:19:34	00:19:35	I'm sorry, you can't come in here.
231	00:19:35	00:19:37	LVPD, clear everybody out of here.
232	00:19:37	00:19:41	I want to have a word with Mr. Mingus. Please, I'm his doctor.
233	00:19:41	00:19:43	What kind of getup is that?
234	00:19:43	00:19:45	Don't touch me.
235	00:19:45	00:19:46	We both know that gun's not loaded.
236	00:19:47	00:19:47	Las Vegas Police.
237	00:19:48	00:19:49	Mr. Mingus, you're under arrest.
238	00:19:49	00:19:52	You're gonna have to shoot me before you arrest me.
239	00:19:52	00:19:53	Come on, go ahead.
240	00:19:53	00:19:55	Shoot me.
241	00:19:57	00:19:59	I've got backup coming. He's not going anywhere.
242	00:19:59	00:20:03	Don't make it harder on yourself! (grunts)
243	00:20:12	00:20:14	They're all fake!
244	00:20:15	00:20:18	They're fake!
245	00:20:18	00:20:19	(cheering) They're all fake!
246	00:20:19	00:20:21	They're fake!
247	00:20:24	00:20:26	Vinnie, you're making a fool of yourself!
248	00:20:26	00:20:30	I'm making a fool out of myself?!
249	00:20:30	00:20:31	Whoa!
250	00:20:31	00:20:33	Hold your fire!
251	00:20:33	00:20:34	Put the gun down!
252	00:20:34	00:20:37	These guns are not even loaded.
253	00:20:37	00:20:38	You see?
254	00:20:54	00:21:06	Chaos erupted today at the Delos Auditorium-- home to the Supreme Force Fighting Championship-- after a police chase through the crowded theater ended in the bizarre apparent suicide of Vinnie Mingus...
255	00:21:06	00:21:07	Thanks for your cooperation, Doctor.
256	00:21:07	00:21:08	Thank you.
257	00:21:08	00:21:13	Okay, so the fight doctor says that Mingus came to him with his arm all torn up.
258	00:21:13	00:21:15	He's infected and feverish.
259	00:21:15	00:21:19	So, the doctor wraps up his arm, tells him to go to a hospital, Mingus refuses.
260	00:21:20	00:21:23	So he gives him a bunch of antibiotics, hopes for the best.
261	00:21:23	00:21:25	Clearly, Mingus was involved in some kind of assault.
262	00:21:25	00:21:27	Why didn't the doctor inform the authorities?
263	00:21:27	00:21:29	He says he knows Mingus and he's afraid of him.
264	00:21:29	00:21:31	Says Mingus is half psychotic on a good day.
265	00:21:32	00:21:38	You know, maybe the Agent Hatford interview spooked him-- Mingus goes nuts, follows him, takes him out.
266	00:21:38	00:21:41	Well, thank you, Captain, for all your hard work.
267	00:21:41	00:21:42	Sure. So what's next?
268	00:21:42	00:21:43	Os Punho?
269	00:21:43	00:21:45	We're going to finish what we started.
270	00:21:45	00:21:47	Keep me in the loop. All right?
271	00:21:47	00:21:49	All right. We will.
272	00:21:56	00:22:03	In Mingus's gym bag, we found Agent Hatford's notebook, his badge and his gun.
273	00:22:06	00:22:08	It's empty.
274	00:22:08	00:22:10	A Davis P-380.
275	00:22:10	00:22:13	It's a weird gun for a fed to carry.
276	00:22:16	00:22:17	Oh, my bad.
277	00:22:17	00:22:19	It's a street piece. Uh-huh.
278	00:22:19	00:22:20	Must be Mingus's.
279	00:22:21	00:22:23	Which means Agent Hatford's weapon is still unaccounted for.
280	00:22:25	00:22:26	Hmm.
281	00:22:26	00:22:29	Roid Boy was sending out a lot of pictures.
282	00:22:29	00:22:30	They're all of the Feebs.
283	00:22:30	00:22:33	Looks like he was conducting an investigation of his own.
284	00:22:34	00:22:36	Track down that number.
285	00:22:36	00:22:38	Run fingerprints, DNA.
286	00:22:39	00:22:41	Swab last for trace.
287	00:22:41	00:22:43	We always save the best for last.
288	00:22:43	00:22:46	Yes, David, that's already getting old.
289	00:22:49	00:22:51	Hey, Catherine. Yeah?
290	00:22:51	00:22:56	Do you remember a Jane Doe we found off of Spencer Street about three months ago?
291	00:22:56	00:23:00	Sadly, you're gonna have to be more specific than that.
292	00:23:00	00:23:03	Pretty brunette, caught up in prostitution, underage.
293	00:23:03	00:23:05	Gunshot wound to the head.
294	00:23:08	00:23:13	Okay, yes, I do remember her. I saw a picture of her on a board in the FBI command post.
295	00:23:13	00:23:15	She's mixed up in this human trafficking ring.
296	00:23:15	00:23:17	Did the feds talk to her?
297	00:23:18	00:23:19	Yeah.
298	00:23:19	00:23:21	And they got it on video.
299	00:23:29	00:23:32	That's quite an assembly line.
300	00:23:32	00:23:34	Out with the old, in with the new.
301	00:23:34	00:23:35	Yeah.
302	00:23:35	00:23:37	Watch this.
303	00:23:37	00:23:40	Everything that you say in this room is confidential.
304	00:23:40	00:23:42	Now, do you know what confidential means?
305	00:23:45	00:23:49	My speak is not good, but...
306	00:23:49	00:23:52	I understand good.
307	00:23:52	00:23:55	Okay, how old are you, sweetheart?
308	00:23:55	00:23:57	Twenty-one.
309	00:23:57	00:24:00	No, I know that that's what they told you to say.
310	00:24:00	00:24:03	Sweetie, how old are you really?
311	00:24:03	00:24:05	Sixteen.
312	00:24:05	00:24:07	It's okay.
313	00:24:07	00:24:20	You know, we've seen a lot of young girls like you on Hill Street being shoved into limos and forced to do God-knows-what with dirty, old men.
314	00:24:20	00:24:22	Who brought you here, Rio?
315	00:24:24	00:24:27	I can't.
316	00:24:27	00:24:29	He will kill me.
317	00:24:31	00:24:34	I will be dead, you understand?
318	00:24:34	00:24:38	You won't be dead, because we will protect you.
319	00:24:38	00:24:40	But you need to help us.
320	00:24:40	00:24:41	Who is he?
321	00:24:45	00:24:47	Who is he?
322	00:24:47	00:24:49	Look, we're trying to help you out here.
323	00:24:49	00:24:51	We're giving you the benefit of the doubt.
324	00:24:51	00:24:53	But you're a prostitute, a criminal.
325	00:24:53	00:24:55	Unless you help us, you're gonna go to jail.
326	00:24:55	00:24:57	No more talk, no more.
327	00:24:57	00:25:00	I go to jail, okay?
328	00:25:00	00:25:02	Please take me to jail.
329	00:25:02	00:25:04	Please take me to jail.
330	00:25:07	00:25:09	Let her go.
331	00:25:16	00:25:20	Their files indicate that they never reinterviewed her.
332	00:25:20	00:25:22	Three days later, she was dead.
333	00:25:22	00:25:26	Maybe Os Punho found out that she was picked up and questioned.
334	00:25:26	00:25:29	Had her killed on the street as a warning to the other girls.
335	00:26:24	00:26:26	What's happening, Professor?
336	00:26:26	00:26:28	I just printed Vinnie Mingus's gun.
337	00:26:28	00:26:29	At least, I thought it was his gun.
338	00:26:29	00:26:30	What do you mean?
339	00:26:30	00:26:34	It appears to have Agent Hatford's prints all over it.
340	00:26:34	00:26:39	Now, why would an FBI agent be carrying a street gun with a filed-down serial number on it?
341	00:26:39	00:26:40	He wouldn't-- maybe it's a drop gun.
342	00:26:40	00:26:42	Are you saying Agent Hatford was dirty?
343	00:26:42	00:26:44	It happens.
344	00:26:44	00:26:47	Maybe Agent Hatford was mixed up with Mingus or Os Punho somehow.
345	00:26:47	00:26:49	Excuse me, sir.
346	00:26:49	00:26:52	Hold on. Captain Brass, you have a 420 on Hill Street.
347	00:26:52	00:26:54	(sighs) Hooker or pimp?
348	00:27:07	00:27:08	Agent Bechman, I was actually gonna call you.
349	00:27:08	00:27:09	What are you doing here?
350	00:27:10	00:27:11	The operation was undercover.
351	00:27:16	00:27:19	Okay, David, what have you got for me tonight?
352	00:27:38	00:27:39	Oh, man.
353	00:27:40	00:27:42	It's Agent Stanley.
354	00:27:43	00:27:44	Yeah, Wendy?
355	00:27:44	00:27:51	Captain, I just got this e-mail from FBI Quantico, and there is no record of any agent by the name of William Ray Hatford.
356	00:27:52	00:27:53	They're saying this guy was a fake.
357	00:27:53	00:27:54	Okay, thanks.
358	00:28:08	00:28:11	There's stippling and powder burns around the wound.
359	00:28:12	00:28:14	It was a close-range shot.
360	00:28:15	00:28:19	Somebody probably walked right up behind her on the street.
361	00:28:23	00:28:25	Looks like Emma was suicidal.
362	00:28:28	00:28:29	Those are old scars.
363	00:28:29	00:28:32	Yes, but vertical, which means she was serious.
364	00:28:32	00:28:34	Guess she finally got her wish.
365	00:28:35	00:28:39	Hey, Live Scan got a hit on her prints.
366	00:28:39	00:28:40	Her real name is Emma Mosler.
367	00:28:40	00:28:42	She's got a record.
368	00:28:42	00:28:44	She did two years for prostitution.
369	00:28:44	00:28:49	So, she was a prostitute posing as an FBI agent posing... as a prostitute?
370	00:28:49	00:28:53	To bust a prostitution ring?
371	00:28:57	00:29:00	Okay, take everything, and we'll figure out what's real and what's not real later.
372	00:29:11	00:29:16	There was this trucker in Gerald, Missouri, who rolled into town and told everybody he was a DEA agent.
373	00:29:16	00:29:19	Started busting every meth head in town.
374	00:29:20	00:29:21	It was months before somebody finally caught on.
375	00:29:21	00:29:23	Don't try to make me feel better.
376	00:29:23	00:29:25	Can I give it a try, Jim?
377	00:29:25	00:29:27	I've been with the Bureau 15 years.
378	00:29:27	00:29:29	This would have fooled me.
379	00:29:29	00:29:30	Well, it didn't fool Vinnie Mingus.
380	00:29:30	00:29:31	He knew they were fakes.
381	00:29:31	00:29:32	He thought we were fakes, too.
382	00:29:33	00:29:34	Blew his brains out trying to prove it.
383	00:29:34	00:29:38	Be nice to find Agent Bechman before Os Punho does-- we anywhere on that?
384	00:29:38	00:29:39	No.
385	00:29:39	00:29:42	All we have is a lease made out to...
386	00:29:42	00:29:45	I Can See For Miles, Incorporated.
387	00:29:55	00:29:57	All right, Nevada tags.
388	00:29:57	00:30:01	Alpha, Charlie, David, Foxtrot, three, four, eight.
389	00:30:05	00:30:08	Registered owner is I Can See For Miles, Inc.
390	00:30:08	00:30:11	Same address as their command post.
391	00:30:12	00:30:14	It looks like Miles covered all his bases.
392	00:30:16	00:30:18	Yeah, well, maybe Emma didn't cover hers.
393	00:30:18	00:30:22	We know when and where she swiped her card.
394	00:30:22	00:30:24	The bill's got to get sent somewhere.
395	00:30:27	00:30:28	A halfway house?
396	00:30:28	00:30:33	Yeah... well, we think she was stealing identities from the residents.
397	00:30:33	00:30:35	How hard could that be?
398	00:30:41	00:30:44	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
399	00:30:44	00:30:46	This is Ray Langston from the crime lab.
400	00:30:48	00:30:51	Is there someone in charge here that I can talk to?
401	00:30:51	00:30:52	That would be me.
402	00:30:52	00:30:54	00.
403	00:30:55	00:30:56	Do you know this woman?
404	00:30:58	00:31:00	Yeah, sure, I know her.
405	00:31:00	00:31:01	Emma.
406	00:31:01	00:31:06	You know, most of the ladies here are pretty nasty, but man, oh, man, she is sweet.
407	00:31:06	00:31:09	I seen her in the shower once shaving her pits.
408	00:31:09	00:31:11	High point of my life.
409	00:31:11	00:31:13	Is she a resident? Uh-huh.
410	00:31:13	00:31:15	Okay.
411	00:31:17	00:31:19	Let's see.
412	00:31:19	00:31:21	Says here that Emma signed out two days ago.
413	00:31:21	00:31:24	Never signed back in.
414	00:31:24	00:31:25	And nobody noticed?
415	00:31:25	00:31:28	Look, this isn't a lockup facility.
416	00:31:28	00:31:31	Everybody here is free to come and go.
417	00:31:31	00:31:33	They're just supposed to sign in and out.
418	00:31:33	00:31:35	How about this guy?
419	00:31:35	00:31:37	You seen him?
420	00:31:37	00:31:39	Yeah, sure, um, Miles Gelson.
421	00:31:39	00:31:43	Uh, he came to us courtesy of CNPH.
422	00:31:43	00:31:46	Central Nevada Psychiatric Hospital.
423	00:31:46	00:31:47	Very good.
424	00:31:47	00:31:49	What about this man?
425	00:31:49	00:31:50	Hmm.
426	00:31:51	00:31:55	Billy Ray Salvy, another resident.
427	00:31:55	00:31:57	He's been MIA for three days.
428	00:31:57	00:31:58	Another resident.
429	00:31:58	00:32:00	So, we've been working a case with a couple of...
430	00:32:00	00:32:01	Crazy people?
431	00:32:01	00:32:02	It's okay to call them that.
432	00:32:02	00:32:04	That's what I call them.
433	00:32:04	00:32:08	Look, um, you're welcome to talk to Miles if you'd like.
434	00:32:08	00:32:09	He's here?
435	00:32:10	00:32:12	According to this.
436	00:32:15	00:32:16	Here we go.
437	00:32:16	00:32:17	No, no, no, hold on.
438	00:32:17	00:32:19	We'll take it from here.
439	00:32:19	00:32:20	Thanks.
440	00:32:37	00:32:38	Hello, Miles.
441	00:32:40	00:32:43	We have some questions that need to be answered.
442	00:32:56	00:32:59	I'm undercover here.
443	00:33:01	00:33:04	All the people, they think I'm with them.
444	00:33:05	00:33:08	So... if you want to talk...
445	00:33:11	00:33:15	...put handcuffs on me, and take me outside.
446	00:33:15	00:33:20	Got to be careful, very careful, 'cause I can't, I can't blow this cover.
447	00:33:20	00:33:22	I understand.
448	00:33:23	00:33:25	Just one second.
449	00:33:26	00:33:31	Captain, the man is clearly a fantasy-prone personality type.
450	00:33:31	00:33:35	I think it's best if we...
451	00:33:35	00:33:37	go along with it.
452	00:33:37	00:33:39	You're the doctor.
453	00:33:41	00:33:43	Miles Gelson, we have a warrant for your arrest.
454	00:33:44	00:33:45	Stand up.
455	00:33:46	00:33:48	Put your hands behind your back!
456	00:33:48	00:33:50	Let's go.
457	00:33:54	00:34:00	You're probably wondering where I was when Agent Stanley was...
458	00:34:00	00:34:02	uh, was, uh...
459	00:34:04	00:34:07	I, uh, I received a call from...
460	00:34:07	00:34:08	Gun!
461	00:34:23	00:34:24	Dispatch, this is Brass.
462	00:34:24	00:34:25	Shots fired, my location.
463	00:34:26	00:34:27	Suspect down.
464	00:34:27	00:34:28	He's dead. Dead?
465	00:34:28	00:34:29	Yes, sir.
466	00:34:29	00:34:30	Code four.
467	00:34:40	00:34:43	Good work, Detective.
468	00:34:43	00:34:45	I'm putting you in for commendation.
469	00:34:45	00:34:46	Shut up!
470	00:34:46	00:34:48	Shut up, you whack job! You see this?!
471	00:34:48	00:34:50	Captain... You see this? This is real. You see this?
472	00:34:50	00:34:52	People are dead here because of you! Stop it.
473	00:34:52	00:34:53	Jim, I've got it! Because of you!
474	00:34:53	00:34:54	You're a fraud! I got it!
475	00:34:54	00:34:57	Get him out of here. (sirens approaching)
476	00:35:13	00:35:16	The driver's cell phone was recovered at the scene.
477	00:35:16	00:35:18	Clearly, Mingus was spreading the word about the phony feds.
478	00:35:20	00:35:27	I figure the shooter was one of Os Punho's lower level punks, finishing what Mingus started.
479	00:35:27	00:35:29	How much time is he looking at?
480	00:35:29	00:35:40	Let's see-- impersonating a federal officer, at least two counts of accessory murder, and every person he hauled off the street to interview would be an additional count of kidnapping.
481	00:35:40	00:35:42	15 to 20, minimum.
482	00:35:42	00:35:45	His best bet would be to plead diminished capacity.
483	00:35:45	00:35:48	He's got that covered.
484	00:35:52	00:35:55	This is all from the fake command post?
485	00:35:57	00:35:58	Huh.
486	00:35:58	00:36:00	Uh-huh.
487	00:36:01	00:36:02	What are you doing?
488	00:36:02	00:36:05	That is a good question.
489	00:36:06	00:36:09	This is the evidence ledger from the fake feds' locker.
490	00:36:09	00:36:14	It's filled with dates and corresponding alphabetic codes.
491	00:36:14	00:36:17	This is the date that that girl, Rio, was killed.
492	00:36:17	00:36:20	So it stands to reason that...
493	00:36:20	00:36:22	This code could identify the murder weapon.
494	00:36:22	00:36:27	That is a perfectly logical conclusion.
495	00:36:27	00:36:28	It's also wrong.
496	00:36:29	00:36:32	That code isn't on any of these weapons.
497	00:36:32	00:36:35	In fact, none of the codes on the ledger are.
498	00:36:36	00:36:43	I've tried to decipher it using simple shift and substitution codes, no luck.
499	00:36:43	00:36:47	Unless we find a cipher key, we may never figure it out.
500	00:36:50	00:36:52	Maybe Miles is the key.
501	00:37:02	00:37:04	Hello, Miles.
502	00:37:08	00:37:11	I'm truly sorry about your friends.
503	00:37:16	00:37:18	I'm here because I need your help.
504	00:37:20	00:37:27	This, uh, entry in your evidence ledger corresponds to the day that girl, Rio, was killed.
505	00:37:28	00:37:30	What does it mean?
506	00:37:41	00:37:42	All right...
507	00:37:43	00:37:45	Miles, um...
508	00:37:51	00:37:53	I think I know what happened, Miles.
509	00:37:55	00:38:00	I think you and Emma and Billy Ray...
510	00:38:00	00:38:04	were trying to clean up your corner of the world, do some good.
511	00:38:07	00:38:10	To do that, you had to reinvent yourselves.
512	00:38:17	00:38:20	All I did was get them killed.
513	00:38:20	00:38:23	Look, they died fighting.
514	00:38:23	00:38:25	Trying to help people who couldn't help themselves.
515	00:38:31	00:38:35	Now let me help you finish what you started.
516	00:38:52	00:39:08	L-G-D-G-D-S dash U-A-P means Little guy dropped gun down sewer.
517	00:39:09	00:39:13	Unable to apprehend perp.
518	00:39:13	00:39:31	Corresponding evidence tagged with G-T-L-B-D Gun little bastard dropped.
519	00:39:31	00:39:36	Gonna nail his ass someday.
520	00:39:40	00:39:42	Now, have you tried this before?
521	00:39:42	00:39:43	Have you screened a weapon?
522	00:39:43	00:39:45	No.
523	00:39:45	00:39:47	Want to try?
524	00:39:47	00:39:48	All right. All right.
525	00:39:48	00:39:55	Okay, you take the gun, and I want you to swab the grip.
526	00:39:55	00:39:57	Right in here.
527	00:39:57	00:39:59	Perfect.
528	00:39:59	00:40:00	I'll hit it with phenol.
529	00:40:02	00:40:03	Nothing.
530	00:40:03	00:40:04	All right.
531	00:40:04	00:40:08	Now, we're going to swab the magazine.
532	00:40:08	00:40:11	'Cause that gets a lot of handling action.
533	00:40:13	00:40:15	Okay.
534	00:40:20	00:40:21	No.
535	00:40:21	00:40:23	So now, we're going to try the opening.
536	00:40:24	00:40:28	And I want you to swab right here underneath the lip.
537	00:40:29	00:40:31	Great.
538	00:40:38	00:40:42	Looks like our killer caught his thumb when he was loading the weapon.
539	00:41:00	00:41:05	The fight doctor is wanted on a long list of open trafficking indictments.
540	00:41:05	00:41:07	And Interpol's been after him for years.
541	00:41:07	00:41:10	We believe he's the one who shot Rio.
542	00:41:26	00:41:29	It's over, Miles.
543	00:41:29	00:41:32	It was the doctor posing as Os Punho.
544	00:41:32	00:41:35	He was running the operation the whole time.
545	00:41:36	00:41:40	A fake cop taking down an imaginary villain.
546	00:41:40	00:41:42	Not imaginary.
547	00:41:42	00:41:44	The suffering, the death he caused, was real.
548	00:41:44	00:41:46	And you put a stop to it.
549	00:41:49	00:41:51	I did?
550	00:41:51	00:41:52	He's in jail.
551	00:41:52	00:41:54	I don't believe he'll ever get out.
552	00:41:55	00:41:58	That's good.
553	00:41:58	00:42:02	I brought you something to pass the time.
554	00:42:10	00:42:12	As I recall...
555	00:42:14	00:42:17	Quixote regained his sanity in the end.
556	00:42:17	00:42:21	But his melancholia persisted.
557	00:42:23	00:42:28	He died emotionally broken and alone.
558	00:42:28	00:42:31	Well, they didn't have antidepressants back in those days.
559	00:42:42	00:42:43	Chapter one.
560	00:42:43	00:43:01	At a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to remember, there lived a little while ago, one of those gentlemen who are wont to keep a lance in the rack, an old buckler, a lean horse and a swift greyhound.
561	00:43:07	00:43:11	they really were giants.
