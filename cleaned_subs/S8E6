0,00:00:13,00:00:15,She-bang!
1,00:00:15,00:00:18,"That's pretty cool, right?"
2,00:00:18,00:00:19,Mm-hmm.
3,00:00:19,00:00:22,"That doesn't happen very often, you know."
4,00:00:22,00:00:24,I know.
5,00:00:26,00:00:28,You won.
6,00:00:29,00:00:30,You beat me!
7,00:00:30,00:00:31,Uh-huh.
8,00:00:33,00:00:35,You want to play again?
9,00:00:37,00:00:39,(die rattling)
10,00:00:39,00:00:41,(sighing): Fine.
11,00:00:41,00:00:44,Whatever.
12,00:00:44,00:00:46,Knock yourself out.
13,00:00:47,00:00:50,(cartoon music playing on TV)

16,00:01:04,00:01:05,(running water stops)
17,00:01:05,00:01:07,(water splashes gently)
18,00:01:07,00:01:08,(weary sigh)
19,00:01:16,00:01:17,"(train wheels clacking, horn blowing)"
20,00:01:17,00:01:19,(glass containers clattering gently)
21,00:01:24,00:01:26,(loud thud in distance)
22,00:01:28,00:01:30,Evan?
23,00:01:36,00:01:39,(thud)
24,00:01:43,00:01:45,"(latch clicks, hinges squeak)"
25,00:01:47,00:01:49,"(train engine rumbling, horn blowing)"
26,00:01:50,00:01:52,(hinges squeak)
27,00:01:52,00:01:54,(screaming)
28,00:01:56,00:01:59,"(thudding, train horn blaring)"
29,00:02:09,00:02:12,(indistinct police radio transmission in background)
30,00:02:15,00:02:17,(train wheels clacking in distance)
31,00:02:47,00:02:49,How long have you been here?
32,00:02:49,00:02:51,About six hours.
33,00:03:06,00:03:09,Why haven't these bodies been released?
34,00:03:09,00:03:11,Good question.
35,00:03:11,00:03:19,"David was in Henderson on another call, so, when Greg and I got here, we just started processing the house."
36,00:03:19,00:03:20,"Found the victim in the bathroom, covered with a towel."
37,00:03:21,00:03:23,We got a plastic print on the bathroom door.
38,00:03:23,00:03:33,It's the strongest piece of evidence-- I photographed it and transmitted the image back to the lab; Mandy got a hit to an unknown palm; case info was in ViCAP.
39,00:03:33,00:03:40,"And then, Dispatch called, telling me to stop processing immediately, by order of the FBI."
40,00:03:40,00:03:42,The FBI field office is right next to the Strip.
41,00:03:42,00:03:44,What's taking them so long?
42,00:03:44,00:03:45,"Oh, beats the hell out of me."
43,00:03:45,00:03:47,(train rumbling)
44,00:03:47,00:03:50,"(rattling, clinking)"
45,00:03:50,00:03:53,(helicopter approaching)
46,00:04:13,00:04:14,"Jack Malone, FBI."
47,00:04:14,00:04:15,Jim Brass.
48,00:04:16,00:04:19,"I'm based in New York, but I was testifying in a case in San Francisco."
49,00:04:19,00:04:23,"When I heard about the ViCAP hit, I got here as fast as I could."
50,00:04:23,00:04:25,Chopper from the Strip? That's nice.
51,00:04:25,00:04:27,That's my tax dollars at work?
52,00:04:27,00:04:30,You get a positive ID on the boy?
53,00:04:30,00:04:33,"No, but we have an ID on the female-- name is Carmen Davis."
54,00:04:33,00:04:34,"According to neighbors, she lives alone."
55,00:04:34,00:04:35,Apparently no kids of her own.
56,00:04:35,00:04:39,"But if I find anything out, I'll let you know. Thank you. You're up."
57,00:04:43,00:04:44,You-- you get enough photos?
58,00:04:44,00:04:46,Definitely.
59,00:04:46,00:04:48,Roll the body over.
60,00:05:01,00:05:03,What's going on?
61,00:05:05,00:05:07,"Jack Malone, FBI, New York City."
62,00:05:09,00:05:13,This boy was kidnapped from his babysitter's apartment six years ago.
63,00:05:13,00:05:15,Babysitter was killed.
64,00:05:15,00:05:18,The only evidence at the crime scene was a bloody palm print.
65,00:05:18,00:05:21,"Well, there may be a resemblance, but kids change a lot in six years."
66,00:05:21,00:05:23,JACK: Mm-hmm.
67,00:05:23,00:05:26,GRISSOM: DNA will tell us if this is your kid.
68,00:05:26,00:05:29,But it does look like your killer came to Vegas.
69,00:05:34,00:05:37,and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
70,00:06:02,00:06:06,"PHILLIPS: Based on lividity and rigor, TOD-- roughly 24 hours ago."
71,00:06:06,00:06:09,And he's got perimortem bruising on the back of the neck.
72,00:06:09,00:06:11,And a single sharp-force injury to the forehead.
73,00:06:17,00:06:19,Looks like he hit his head on the table.
74,00:06:19,00:06:21,Or somebody slammed it against the table.
75,00:06:21,00:06:22,"Well, we don't knowthatyet."
76,00:06:25,00:06:29,"Agent Malone, why don't I fill you in on what else we do know."
77,00:06:29,00:06:32,There are no signs anywhere that the boy actually lived here.
78,00:06:32,00:06:35,The sleeping bag on the couch indicates that he was probably a house guest.
79,00:06:35,00:06:38,Why don't you follow me into the kitchen.
80,00:06:39,00:06:41,Let me know when you're ready to transport the body.
81,00:06:41,00:06:43,"PHILLIPS: Yes, sir."
82,00:07:02,00:07:04,"WILLOWS: Bring us up to speed, Greg."
83,00:07:04,00:07:06,"Okay, sure. Um..."
84,00:07:06,00:07:11,Carmen Davis's keys were still in her purse; the car's outside.
85,00:07:11,00:07:17,"No cash in the wallet, and the credit cards have been removed and neatly stacked on the table; it appears as though they've been wiped clean."
86,00:07:17,00:07:21,The killer was smart enough not to take anything that could be traced.
87,00:07:21,00:07:23,Which suggests that he was an experienced criminal.
88,00:07:23,00:07:26,What do you know about this guy?
89,00:07:26,00:07:28,Including everything you just told me?
90,00:07:28,00:07:30,Everything you just told me.
91,00:07:30,00:07:34,"Six years ago, the killer took the murder weapon with him."
92,00:07:34,00:07:38,It was a baseball bat that he found in the apartment.
93,00:07:38,00:07:40,"Well, this time, we think it's a hammer."
94,00:07:42,00:07:47,The round indentation wounds are consistent with hammer blows.
95,00:07:47,00:07:51,Do you see any similarities between this victim and the babysitter who was killed six years ago?
96,00:07:51,00:07:53,Just that they were both bludgeoned to death.
97,00:07:53,00:07:56,"The babysitter was a lot older, and she wasn't covered."
98,00:07:56,00:08:00,Covering a body usually indicates remorse on the part of the killer.
99,00:08:00,00:08:04,So you think he felt remorseful about this victim and not the one from six years ago?
100,00:08:04,00:08:06,Maybe he knew Carmen Davis.
101,00:08:06,00:08:11,"There's three toothbrushes, two of them in travel cases."
102,00:08:12,00:08:15,My guess: the killer was staying here with the little boy.
103,00:08:15,00:08:18,There was no sign of forced entry.
104,00:08:18,00:08:19,PHILLIPS: Agent Malone?
105,00:08:19,00:08:21,We're ready to take the boy out.
106,00:08:21,00:08:22,Okay.
107,00:08:22,00:08:27,"(sighing): So, I assume we'll be sending over the case evidence to Quantico?"
108,00:08:28,00:08:30,We can't process the evidence from every case we're involved in.
109,00:08:30,00:08:32,We have a massive overload already.
110,00:08:33,00:08:34,This will be joint jurisdiction.
111,00:08:34,00:08:38,"You do your thing, I'll do mine."
112,00:08:41,00:08:43,(siren wails in distance)
113,00:08:46,00:08:49,COD is multiple blunt-force trauma.
114,00:08:49,00:09:00,"Based on the development of the contusions, it appears the blow to the back of the skull was the first impact, but the ones on the face came about half-hour later."
115,00:09:00,00:09:01,Half an hour? Yeah.
116,00:09:01,00:09:02,Was she raped?
117,00:09:02,00:09:03,Yeah.
118,00:09:03,00:09:10,"I, uh, did a wet mount, found semen in the vaginal vault, and I collected an SAE kit."
119,00:09:10,00:09:13,This guy is some piece of work.
120,00:09:13,00:09:16,I'll get it to DNA.
121,00:09:35,00:09:37,No birthmarks.
122,00:09:37,00:09:40,"Our missing boy didn't have any, either."
123,00:09:40,00:09:42,So the only way to confirm the identity...
124,00:09:42,00:09:45,I've had the original DNA report electronically sent to your lab.
125,00:09:45,00:09:49,"Well, then you'll just have to wait for your answer."
126,00:09:51,00:09:55,"You know, maybe now would be a good time for you to brief us on the original case."
127,00:09:58,00:09:59,JACK: His name was Jason Taylor.
128,00:09:59,00:10:01,(glass breaking) He was at his babysitter's apartment.
129,00:10:01,00:10:03,He'd been home sick from school.
130,00:10:03,00:10:06,That's when it happened.
131,00:10:12,00:10:13,(camera shutter clicking)
132,00:10:16,00:10:23,"An unidentified male entered, most likely through an open window on the fire escape, murdered the babysitter and took Jason with him."
133,00:10:28,00:10:32,We never got a decent description of the perp.
134,00:10:32,00:10:33,Nothing was stolen?
135,00:10:33,00:10:37,Cash was still in the babysitter's purse; the only thing missing was a baseball bat.
136,00:10:37,00:10:41,"Which, based on her wounds, you figure that was the murder weapon? Mm-hmm."
137,00:10:41,00:10:44,"Baseball bat there, hammer here-- weapons of convenience."
138,00:10:44,00:10:46,Guy seems to grab whatever's handy.
139,00:10:46,00:10:47,WILLOWS: And takes it with him.
140,00:10:47,00:10:49,Was the babysitter raped?
141,00:10:49,00:10:51,No.
142,00:10:51,00:10:55,"STOKES: Why kidnap a kid, wait six years, then kill him?"
143,00:10:55,00:10:59,WILLOWS: Most four year olds will do what you tell them.
144,00:10:59,00:11:02,Most ten year olds will do what they want.
145,00:11:02,00:11:05,"BROWN: Kid starts asking the wrong questions, talking to the wrong people..."
146,00:11:05,00:11:07,Tons of possibilities.
147,00:11:07,00:11:09,Yes. Way too many.
148,00:11:09,00:11:12,"According to this, the kid was adopted."
149,00:11:12,00:11:14,Did you take a look at the biological parents?
150,00:11:14,00:11:16,Jason was adopted as an infant.
151,00:11:16,00:11:18,There was no way we could track his records.
152,00:11:19,00:11:22,BROWN: Adoptive parents had no contact with the kidnappers?
153,00:11:22,00:11:24,They were not given any ransom demands?
154,00:11:24,00:11:25,There was no motive.
155,00:11:26,00:11:28,I couldn't even give the parents a reason.
156,00:11:28,00:11:30,Maybe there isn't one.
157,00:11:30,00:11:34,Most children are abducted by somebody who's associated with the family.
158,00:11:34,00:11:38,Random kidnappings are extraordinarily rare.
159,00:11:38,00:11:42,"Except in the U.S. last year, there were almost a hundred."
160,00:11:45,00:11:48,Some things are just random.
161,00:11:48,00:11:51,Have you ever tried telling that to the parents of a child who's been kidnapped?
162,00:11:51,00:11:54,"Yes, actually, I have."
163,00:11:54,00:11:56,And how'd that work out for you?
164,00:12:03,00:12:06,(equipment whirring)
165,00:12:13,00:12:15,"Hey, guys."
166,00:12:15,00:12:18,Found an empty jewelry box in the bedroom.
167,00:12:18,00:12:22,Maybe the killer swiped the jewelry in addition to the cash.
168,00:12:22,00:12:24,Easy to fence in this neighborhood.
169,00:12:24,00:12:28,Was the dead girl wearing any jewelry when you found her?
170,00:12:28,00:12:34,"Nope. Then that's a good call, man, 'cause she's wearing some in just about every one of these pictures."
171,00:12:34,00:12:36,I wouldn't doubt if she kept a lot of it in that box.
172,00:12:36,00:12:39,"I'll check with the local pawn shops, see if anything's been hocked."
173,00:12:46,00:12:51,"Hey, Greg, you see any books on the shelf over there on gambling or poker?"
174,00:12:51,00:12:56,"No, just a lot of romance novels, mysteries and women's health."
175,00:12:56,00:13:03,"'Cause I got poker player stats, and multiple websites on online gambling."
176,00:13:03,00:13:06,Seems kind of out of place to be the victim's.
177,00:13:08,00:13:13,I think we got a mystery houseguest who is a card shark.
178,00:13:20,00:13:23,(indistinct talking)
179,00:13:26,00:13:29,MAN (over speakers): Welcome to our annual poker tournament.
180,00:13:29,00:13:37,The first of the elimination rounds are over and we're down to our last 100 players.
181,00:13:37,00:13:40,"Good luck, everyone."
182,00:13:57,00:13:59,(slot machines beeping)
183,00:14:34,00:14:40,(coins clinking)
184,00:14:52,00:14:53,Got him!
185,00:15:20,00:15:21,You know what this is?
186,00:15:21,00:15:23,Huh?
187,00:15:23,00:15:25,This is police brutality.
188,00:15:25,00:15:26,"Yeah, whatever."
189,00:15:29,00:15:31,We're not done yet.
190,00:15:31,00:15:35,"BRASS: Well, he doesn't look like much, but then again, they never do."
191,00:15:35,00:15:37,"JACK: If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to him first."
192,00:15:37,00:15:39,"You don't have to be polite, Jack."
193,00:15:39,00:15:42,"This is a federal case, you don't need my permission."
194,00:15:46,00:15:49,BRASS: How you going to go at him?
195,00:15:49,00:15:52,I don't know.
196,00:15:52,00:15:56,I usually just make it up as I go along.
197,00:16:02,00:16:04,BROWN: All done here.
198,00:16:04,00:16:05,Thank you.
199,00:16:05,00:16:07,"You can leave, too."
200,00:16:12,00:16:14,Mr. Michaels.
201,00:16:14,00:16:19,Jack Malone. FBI.
202,00:16:19,00:16:21,Huh.
203,00:16:21,00:16:23,FBI.
204,00:16:23,00:16:25,Mm-hmm.
205,00:16:26,00:16:28,Why'd you run back there?
206,00:16:28,00:16:30,"Oh, I don't know. I was scared, I guess."
207,00:16:30,00:16:31,Of what?
208,00:16:32,00:16:34,Um... of getting caught.
209,00:16:34,00:16:36,Being embarrassed.
210,00:16:37,00:16:38,Right.
211,00:16:38,00:16:41,So it's probably a good idea not to do anything that would embarrass you.
212,00:16:42,00:16:43,"Yeah, I know."
213,00:16:43,00:16:46,"But you never really think you're going to get caught, do you?"
214,00:16:46,00:16:49,"Yeah, but you did."
215,00:16:49,00:16:52,You want to talk about it?
216,00:16:52,00:16:56,I got nowhere I have to be.
217,00:16:56,00:16:59,And you got nowhere to go.
218,00:17:02,00:17:06,(sighs sharply)
219,00:17:06,00:17:09,I don't know what the big deal is.
220,00:17:09,00:17:11,I mean...
221,00:17:11,00:17:13,"we've all thought about it, right?"
222,00:17:13,00:17:17,Sure. It's natural.
223,00:17:17,00:17:18,Right.
224,00:17:18,00:17:20,I had a plan.
225,00:17:20,00:17:21,It was simple.
226,00:17:21,00:17:23,I take it...
227,00:17:24,00:17:26,I play with it for a little while...
228,00:17:26,00:17:28,"""It""?"
229,00:17:28,00:17:30,Like it's property?
230,00:17:30,00:17:32,"Yeah, yeah, it's nothing personal."
231,00:17:32,00:17:35,I didn't even think Brother Willard would even miss it.
232,00:17:35,00:17:37,Brother Willard?
233,00:17:37,00:17:41,You want to talk to me about Brother Willard?
234,00:17:44,00:17:45,(sighs)
235,00:17:45,00:17:47,Brother Willard is my spiritual advisor.
236,00:17:47,00:17:50,He's supposed to talk me out of doing things like this.
237,00:17:50,00:17:52,But you know what? Sometimes I just...
238,00:17:52,00:17:55,I just feel like listening to that little voice inside my head.
239,00:17:55,00:17:58,Hmm.
240,00:17:58,00:18:02,Right.
241,00:18:06,00:18:11,And what is that little voice inside your head telling you right now?
242,00:18:11,00:18:15,Just take it.
243,00:18:18,00:18:24,"""Just take it."" This is not the first time that you've taken something that doesn't belong to you, is it?"
244,00:18:24,00:18:26,What do you mean?
245,00:18:26,00:18:28,"Six years ago, in New York City."
246,00:18:28,00:18:30,I don't know anything about New York.
247,00:18:30,00:18:33,"Six years ago, in New York City, you took something that didn't belong to you."
248,00:18:33,00:18:34,I don't know anything about New York.
249,00:18:34,00:18:36,"Look, I told you-- I was going to give it back."
250,00:18:36,00:18:37,"Really, I just had some bad luck."
251,00:18:37,00:18:39,Is that what you call it?!
252,00:18:39,00:18:42,You abducted and murdered a four-year-old boy!
253,00:18:42,00:18:44,I don't know what you're talking about!
254,00:18:44,00:18:45,Hey... JACK: Just bad luck?!
255,00:18:45,00:18:46,Let him go.
256,00:18:46,00:18:51,"Look, you want to rendition him to Gitmo, be my guest, but in this house, we play by the rules."
257,00:18:51,00:18:53,Now get your hand off the suspect.
258,00:19:02,00:19:03,What's that?
259,00:19:06,00:19:09,That's...
260,00:19:09,00:19:14,That's Evan. That's...
261,00:19:15,00:19:18,This is my son.
262,00:19:18,00:19:20,This is Evan.
263,00:19:52,00:19:55,Guy's not the murderer. I know.
264,00:19:55,00:19:57,We ran his palm print. Doesn't match.
265,00:19:57,00:20:00,He's a Mormon from Utah.
266,00:20:00,00:20:03,"Stole $10,000 from the church, entry money into a poker game."
267,00:20:04,00:20:06,"Figured he'd win the money, replaced it before they noticed."
268,00:20:06,00:20:08,And decided he'd bring his kid with him?
269,00:20:08,00:20:09,Single parent.
270,00:20:09,00:20:12,Carmen Davis is an ex-girlfriend.
271,00:20:12,00:20:14,Dropped the kid off with her.
272,00:20:14,00:20:17,"And while he's playing cards, they both get murdered."
273,00:20:17,00:20:19,I got your DNA results.
274,00:20:19,00:20:22,The dead boy was confirmed as Tom Michael's son.
275,00:20:22,00:20:25,So he's definitely not your kidnap victim from New York.
276,00:20:25,00:20:30,"However, the results of the SAE kit on the female victim showed two semen donors."
277,00:20:30,00:20:35,"One was Tom and the other unknown, but that unknown was connected to two unsolved rape murders in CODIS."
278,00:20:35,00:20:36,Excuse me.
279,00:20:36,00:20:39,(typing)
280,00:20:40,00:20:44,"Two years ago in Wyoming, 11 months ago in Idaho."
281,00:20:44,00:20:47,"Okay, one victim was 23, the other one 54."
282,00:20:47,00:20:48,"One blonde, one brunette."
283,00:20:48,00:20:50,Both female.
284,00:20:50,00:20:51,Both with their faces covered.
285,00:20:51,00:20:54,"GRISSOM: Both single, with no kids."
286,00:20:54,00:20:56,Breaks the pattern.
287,00:20:56,00:20:57,If there is a pattern.
288,00:20:57,00:21:01,There's a big gap between Vegas and New York.
289,00:21:01,00:21:06,"Now, this guy has been involved in four murders in the last two years."
290,00:21:06,00:21:08,There's got to be more.
291,00:21:08,00:21:12,"Well, if there are, then there may not be any associated DNA in the system."
292,00:21:12,00:21:15,Small towns usually can't afford to run it if they don't have a suspect.
293,00:21:15,00:21:16,Doesn't mean there's not a pattern.
294,00:21:16,00:21:19,Just means we haven't found it yet.
295,00:21:19,00:21:21,(typing)
296,00:21:30,00:21:31,Special Agent Malone.
297,00:21:31,00:21:33,David Hodges.
298,00:21:33,00:21:41,The granular powder that you found on the dead boy's neck and shirt was largely ammonium nitrates and sulfates-- commercial grade fertilizer.
299,00:21:41,00:21:42,(sighs)
300,00:21:42,00:21:45,"Great, so the killer could be from any farm in the United States."
301,00:21:46,00:21:48,"Yeah, or any backyard."
302,00:21:48,00:21:49,Thank you.
303,00:21:49,00:21:52,"So, I was curious about opportunities at the federal level."
304,00:21:52,00:21:55,"Pay scale, working conditions..."
305,00:21:55,00:21:57,You want my honest opinion?
306,00:21:57,00:21:59,Absolutely.
307,00:21:59,00:22:02,There's a lot less competition in Vegas for a guy like you.
308,00:22:02,00:22:05,The FBI has enough ass-kissers already.
309,00:22:14,00:22:15,I'm looking for Tom Michaels.
310,00:22:15,00:22:17,"Yeah, he's in there."
311,00:22:17,00:22:19,"You might want to give him a minute, though."
312,00:22:19,00:22:21,"He's, uh, saying good-bye."
313,00:22:21,00:22:23,Do you have any kids?
314,00:22:25,00:22:28,Yes. I have two daughters.
315,00:22:56,00:22:59,"Um, Mr. Michaels..."
316,00:23:02,00:23:04,I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.
317,00:23:05,00:23:07,You're afraid I'm going to sue?
318,00:23:13,00:23:20,The same man who murdered your son kidnapped another boy six years ago.
319,00:23:20,00:23:22,"He's here in Vegas, right now."
320,00:23:22,00:23:24,And this is closest that I've ever been to him.
321,00:23:24,00:23:26,You thought it was me.
322,00:23:27,00:23:30,I promise you...
323,00:23:30,00:23:33,that I will do everything in my power to catch this man.
324,00:23:33,00:23:36,Is that what you told the other boy's parents?
325,00:23:44,00:23:46,Those the items?
326,00:23:47,00:23:48,Yep.
327,00:23:48,00:23:50,Damn. This always happens to me.
328,00:23:50,00:23:52,Is that the surveillance?
329,00:23:52,00:23:55,Yeah.
330,00:23:55,00:23:56,That's the guy.
331,00:23:56,00:23:58,Okay.
332,00:23:58,00:24:01,"I almost didn't call you guys, you know."
333,00:24:01,00:24:03,What about me? I'm out 350 bucks.
334,00:24:03,00:24:04,You'll live.
335,00:24:04,00:24:08,"The woman these items belonged to is dead, along with a kid."
336,00:24:08,00:24:11,Oh.
337,00:24:11,00:24:12,Is there a reward?
338,00:24:12,00:24:15,Shut up. You saw him the night before last.
339,00:24:15,00:24:17,You talk to him? He say anything to you?
340,00:24:17,00:24:22,Not much. He showed me the jewels. I gave him his $350.
341,00:24:22,00:24:25,"Uh, he asked me for directions to the Tangiers."
342,00:24:25,00:24:27,Hmm. I showed him how to get there.
343,00:24:27,00:24:28,Recommended that Let It Ride game.
344,00:24:28,00:24:30,It's been pretty lucky for me. (phone dialing)
345,00:24:30,00:24:32,Good for you.
346,00:24:32,00:24:34,MAN: Tangiers Hotel.
347,00:24:34,00:24:37,"This is Captain Jim Brass, LVPD."
348,00:24:37,00:24:40,"Would you connect me to the surveillance room, please?"
349,00:24:40,00:24:42,(beeping)
350,00:24:42,00:24:46,JOHNSON: That's definitely not a guy you want to go home with.
351,00:24:46,00:24:49,That cocktail waitress doesn't know how lucky she is.
352,00:24:49,00:24:51,We need a shot of his face.
353,00:24:51,00:24:54,(typing)
354,00:24:54,00:24:55,"Well, I think he knows that."
355,00:24:55,00:24:57,Just... hold on.
356,00:24:57,00:24:59,Zoom in on the ball cap.
357,00:24:59,00:25:03,There's a logo.
358,00:25:03,00:25:08,(beeping)
359,00:25:08,00:25:14,"""Hargreen Harvest."" He had commercial fertilizer on his hands when he killed Evan Michaels."
360,00:25:14,00:25:16,"He's a migrant worker, perhaps."
361,00:25:16,00:25:19,"Well, Tangiers sent over more than 12 hours on this guy."
362,00:25:19,00:25:23,"It's gonna take some time, but of course I'll let you know the minute I find anything."
363,00:25:23,00:25:25,"Okay, great."
364,00:25:27,00:25:35,"I'll call in some additional AV Techs, help Archie get through the footage, but you know, I've learned that sometimes you can go faster by going slow."
365,00:25:35,00:25:38,"Yeah, well, I like to go faster by going fast."
366,00:25:38,00:25:40,Waiting around is not exactly my best thing.
367,00:25:40,00:25:41,I gathered that from your interrogation technique.
368,00:25:42,00:25:45,"You know, maybe you should go back to your hotel, take a nap."
369,00:25:45,00:25:49,Is this your office? Really? By choice?
370,00:25:49,00:25:53,"It's not some kind of, uh, surplus overflow issue?"
371,00:25:53,00:25:55,What's wrong with my office?
372,00:25:55,00:25:57,"Oh, I don't know."
373,00:25:57,00:26:00,Uh... why don't you tell me?
374,00:26:00,00:26:02,That's an irradiated fetal pig.
375,00:26:02,00:26:05,I used it to determine the effects of radiation on tissue.
376,00:26:05,00:26:06,For what?
377,00:26:06,00:26:07,For fun.
378,00:26:08,00:26:10,"SIDLE: Hey, Gil, I, uh..."
379,00:26:10,00:26:12,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt."
380,00:26:12,00:26:14,"No, no, it's fine. Jack Malone, FBI. Sara Sidle, CSI."
381,00:26:14,00:26:16,(mutters): Hi.
382,00:26:16,00:26:20,Hello. I hear your abduction case is now a serial murder.
383,00:26:20,00:26:23,Uh... yeah.
384,00:26:26,00:26:32,"Well, uh, I got called into work early, but I did pick up Hank, and I took him to the sitter."
385,00:26:32,00:26:34,Thank you. I'll see you when I see you.
386,00:26:35,00:26:37,Pleasure. Hmm.
387,00:26:37,00:26:39,Is Hank your kid?
388,00:26:39,00:26:42,Hank's my dog. She walks him for me sometimes.
389,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Oh, yeah, that's how it starts."
390,00:26:45,00:26:49,"Oh, I have some experience dating in the workplace."
391,00:26:49,00:26:53,"Really? And, uh..."
392,00:26:53,00:26:55,how'd it work out for you?
393,00:26:55,00:26:57,Undetermined.
394,00:26:57,00:27:01,(children shouting and laughing)
395,00:27:03,00:27:06,"(train passing nearby, horn blowing)"
396,00:27:19,00:27:21,(low moaning)
397,00:27:22,00:27:24,"(gasping): Please, help me, help me..."
398,00:27:26,00:27:28,(dogs barking nearby)
399,00:27:28,00:27:31,Kid who found the old man says he lives here with his wife.
400,00:27:31,00:27:33,She doesn't answer.
401,00:27:33,00:27:35,You think the suspect's still in here?
402,00:27:35,00:27:39,We'll know in a minute.
403,00:27:39,00:27:42,You better wait here.
404,00:28:18,00:28:20,Sara...
405,00:28:36,00:28:40,Does the victim have circular indentations on her head?
406,00:28:40,00:28:43,"Yeah. You want to do the autopsy, too? Just let me know."
407,00:28:43,00:28:47,"My guess is, this is the hammer we didn't find at the Davis house."
408,00:28:47,00:28:55,"Why take the murder weapon from one scene, walk around with it for more than a day, use it to kill again, but this time leave it behind?"
409,00:28:55,00:28:58,SIDLE: Maybe he found something better...
410,00:28:58,00:29:02,Colt .45 auto.
411,00:29:02,00:29:03,Case is empty.
412,00:29:06,00:29:08,"(camera beeps, clicks)"
413,00:29:08,00:29:10,Huh.
414,00:29:12,00:29:16,He lost the proceeds from the Vegas murders at the Tangiers.
415,00:29:16,00:29:19,"So, he probably needed more cash."
416,00:29:19,00:29:21,Double murder ATM.
417,00:29:21,00:29:24,"Driver's license is on top, like before."
418,00:29:24,00:29:26,He likes to know their names.
419,00:29:26,00:29:29,I heard the husband died at the hospital.
420,00:29:29,00:29:32,But the killer was definitely here awhile.
421,00:29:32,00:29:36,"According to liver temp, she died a couple hours before the husband."
422,00:29:36,00:29:42,So the husband was here and alive while his wife was being raped and killed?
423,00:29:42,00:29:44,It looks that way.
424,00:29:52,00:29:56,(indistinct police radio transmission)
425,00:29:56,00:29:58,Sara?
426,00:29:58,00:30:00,You okay?
427,00:30:00,00:30:03,I don't know.
428,00:30:03,00:30:06,Do you have any idea how he selects his victims?
429,00:30:06,00:30:08,No.
430,00:30:08,00:30:12,"He picks houses with no security systems, or dogs."
431,00:30:12,00:30:16,"Enters at night when most people are asleep, through open doors or windows."
432,00:30:16,00:30:18,Easy targets.
433,00:30:18,00:30:21,"So, basically at random."
434,00:30:23,00:30:28,"They were spending a night on the sofa, watching a movie."
435,00:30:29,00:30:32,"(voice breaking): It's just, uh..."
436,00:30:34,00:30:36,It's just wrong.
437,00:30:39,00:30:42,(train whistle blows nearby)
438,00:30:42,00:30:44,(indistinct police radio transmission)
439,00:30:57,00:30:59,(cell phone rings)
440,00:31:01,00:31:02,Grissom.
441,00:31:02,00:31:07,"You at the Boulder City house? No, I'm at a railroad spur about a quarter of a mile from the house."
442,00:31:07,00:31:08,You taking a trip?
443,00:31:08,00:31:11,"Carmen Davis's house was next to the tracks, too."
444,00:31:11,00:31:12,So?
445,00:31:12,00:31:15,Freight trains carry bulk fertilizer.
446,00:31:15,00:31:19,I think your killer is riding the rails.
447,00:31:19,00:31:24,All the previous murders were committed within about a mile of an active railroad spur.
448,00:31:24,00:31:30,"Right, so he gets off the train, finds his victim, kills them, rapes them if he feels like it, then just takes off."
449,00:31:30,00:31:36,"So, I cross-referenced similar-patterned unsolveds in ViCAP by proximity to rail spurs."
450,00:31:36,00:31:38,There's at least a dozen cases.
451,00:31:38,00:31:42,"You know, you have the authority to stop all the trains coming in and out of Nevada."
452,00:31:42,00:31:45,"Well, I'm not gonna do that unless I got a face."
453,00:31:45,00:31:49,"If these are the work of your guy, he's piled up one hell of a body count."
454,00:31:53,00:31:56,JOHNSON: Guy kept his head down the entire time.
455,00:31:56,00:31:57,STOKES: Mm-hmm.
456,00:31:57,00:32:02,"Oh, check out what happens when he runs out of money."
457,00:32:02,00:32:06,"He starts hitting on the waitress, been doing it to every one of them that walked by."
458,00:32:06,00:32:07,And this...
459,00:32:07,00:32:10,is the last good image of him before he leaves the casino.
460,00:32:10,00:32:14,He stops to look at this poster and quickly makes a phone call.
461,00:32:16,00:32:18,STOKES: Three numbers?
462,00:32:18,00:32:22,I don't know too many serial killers that dial 911.
463,00:32:22,00:32:24,He's calling Information.
464,00:32:24,00:32:27,(dialing cell phone)
465,00:32:27,00:32:30,"Uh, yes, this is CSI Nick Stokes with the Vegas PD."
466,00:32:30,00:32:35,I need to get the telephone number of one of your pay phones on the casino floor.
467,00:32:35,00:32:37,"Near the, uh, Let It Ride tables."
468,00:32:37,00:32:39,"Yes, ma'am."
469,00:32:39,00:32:42,"So, why was he so interested in this poster?"
470,00:32:42,00:32:44,"Oh, great. Okay."
471,00:32:46,00:32:48,Mm-hmm.
472,00:32:48,00:32:51,Very good. Thank you.
473,00:32:51,00:32:52,Look at this. What is it?
474,00:32:52,00:32:55,"South Point Casino, just outside Boulder City."
475,00:32:55,00:32:57,Might be a reason he went there.
476,00:32:59,00:33:00,(sighs)
477,00:33:00,00:33:02,(dialing number)
478,00:33:02,00:33:07,"Hey, it's Nick. Uh, I need to get an AG waiver to get ahold of some phone numbers."
479,00:33:07,00:33:09,"Yeah, exigent circs."
480,00:33:09,00:33:12,Mm-hmm.
481,00:33:12,00:33:16,702-555-0177.
482,00:33:17,00:33:18,"At, uh..."
483,00:33:18,00:33:19,17-41-33.
484,00:33:19,00:33:21,17-41-33.
485,00:33:22,00:33:24,"Yes, ma'am, day before yesterday."
486,00:33:24,00:33:30,"Well, we know this guy likes waitresses, so maybe that's what he's looking at."
487,00:33:30,00:33:31,"Is that a ""D""?"
488,00:33:31,00:33:35,"No. ""G,"" ""G-I-R""... ""N""?"
489,00:33:35,00:33:37,"Okay, thanks."
490,00:33:37,00:33:38,Gina.
491,00:33:38,00:33:39,Gina Farentino.
492,00:33:39,00:33:42,"He called Information to get her number in Boulder City, but it's unlisted."
493,00:33:44,00:33:46,Maybe that's what pissed him off.
494,00:33:46,00:33:49,He knows where she works.
495,00:33:54,00:33:56,"Yeah, Gina works here; she's off today, though."
496,00:33:56,00:33:57,Probably at home.
497,00:33:57,00:33:59,We checked her house; she's not there.
498,00:33:59,00:34:01,When was the last time you saw her?
499,00:34:01,00:34:02,Not since yesterday.
500,00:34:04,00:34:06,"What about this guy, seen him?"
501,00:34:08,00:34:11,This is the best picture you got? What do you think?
502,00:34:14,00:34:15,There was a guy...
503,00:34:15,00:34:17,I don't know if it's him.
504,00:34:17,00:34:19,He was was on those slots when Gina came on her shift.
505,00:34:19,00:34:22,"(slot machine beeping, bells ringing)"
506,00:34:22,00:34:24,Guess it was his lucky day.
507,00:34:25,00:34:27,Must've thought the jackpot gave him a shot at her.
508,00:34:27,00:34:29,He started chatting her up.
509,00:34:29,00:34:30,Oh...
510,00:34:30,00:34:31,"Where are you going? No, no, no, no."
511,00:34:31,00:34:33,"Hey, come here, come here. What time do you get off?"
512,00:34:33,00:34:35,She blew him off and left.
513,00:34:35,00:34:36,Said she wasn't feeling well.
514,00:34:36,00:34:38,And when did he leave?
515,00:34:38,00:34:40,He cashed out and left a few minutes later.
516,00:34:40,00:34:42,How much did he win?
517,00:34:42,00:34:44,Um...
518,00:34:44,00:34:45,"$2,500."
519,00:34:45,00:34:48,"I need to take a look at his W2-G, okay?"
520,00:34:49,00:34:53,"If you make over twelve hundred bucks, Uncle Sam gets his cut, you know?"
521,00:34:53,00:34:55,That's how we stay in business.
522,00:34:55,00:34:58,Mm-hmm.
523,00:34:58,00:35:00,"It's got name, address, social..."
524,00:35:00,00:35:01,The whole thing has got to be bogus.
525,00:35:02,00:35:08,"Yeah, the cashiers don't really seem to care, no offense, as long as you have a picture ID."
526,00:35:08,00:35:12,And even when that's fake...
527,00:35:12,00:35:14,you can't fake one of those.
528,00:35:17,00:35:21,(intermittent siren blast)
529,00:35:26,00:35:29,"DISPATCH: Chevy Impala, Nevada license Adam-Robert-Charles-Boy-4-2-1."

531,00:35:31,00:35:34,License owner is a Gina Farentino.
532,00:35:34,00:35:36,"Copy, Dispatch."
533,00:35:58,00:36:00,"License and registration, sir."
534,00:36:00,00:36:01,I got it right here.
535,00:36:03,00:36:05,(gunshots)
536,00:36:07,00:36:09,(tires squealing)
537,00:36:14,00:36:16,(indistinct police radio transmission)
538,00:36:44,00:36:46,.45 auto.
539,00:36:46,00:36:48,Same caliber as the one taken from the Boulder City double.
540,00:36:50,00:36:52,You can see the whole thing on video if you want.
541,00:36:52,00:36:55,Was the waitress in the car with him?
542,00:36:55,00:36:58,He was waving at somebody in the passenger seat when he got shot.
543,00:36:58,00:37:02,"According to the time code on the dash cam, it was about 33 minutes ago."
544,00:37:02,00:37:05,That's a pretty good head start. Yeah.
545,00:37:05,00:37:06,I don't want to lose this guy.
546,00:37:06,00:37:08,(cell phone ringing)
547,00:37:12,00:37:14,Grissom.
548,00:37:14,00:37:17,We ran the fingerprints that Nick lifted from the casino IRS form.
549,00:37:17,00:37:19,Got an AFIS hit.
550,00:37:19,00:37:20,Terry Lee Wicker.
551,00:37:20,00:37:24,Served two years in Sing Sing for burglary.
552,00:37:24,00:37:31,"He got out four months before Jack's original kidnapping, and get this, when he was sent up, he was married to Gina Farentino."
553,00:37:31,00:37:34,Brass put out a broadcast.
554,00:37:34,00:37:35,"Listen, do me a favor."
555,00:37:35,00:37:38,"Take a look at the map, find the nearest railway spur to our location."
556,00:37:44,00:37:48,Meadowood.
557,00:37:48,00:37:51,"It's off the 93, and it looks to be about..."
558,00:37:51,00:37:55,16 miles northeast of your location.
559,00:38:04,00:38:08,(intermittent siren blasts)
560,00:38:28,00:38:29,What the hell's going on?
561,00:38:29,00:38:31,Did you see who drove this car here?
562,00:38:31,00:38:33,"No, but I called the tow company."
563,00:38:33,00:38:35,You can't park here. (train whistle blowing)
564,00:38:39,00:38:41,Where's that train going?
565,00:38:41,00:38:42,The Fresno 211.
566,00:38:42,00:38:43,Chicago bound.
567,00:38:43,00:38:46,Any other trains pass through here in the last hour?
568,00:38:46,00:38:49,"No, and nothing else is scheduled for another hour."
569,00:38:49,00:38:50,Can you stop that train?
570,00:38:50,00:38:52,"I don't have that capacity, no."
571,00:38:52,00:38:55,Who you guys looking for?
572,00:39:45,00:39:47,(panting)
573,00:39:47,00:39:48,You starting to miss the lab?
574,00:39:48,00:39:51,"No, I like a good field trip."
575,00:39:51,00:39:53,Right. Stay behind me.
576,00:40:32,00:40:35,Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em!
577,00:40:35,00:40:37,You Wicker?
578,00:40:37,00:40:40,"No. The name's Baxter, and I ain't got no ticket."
579,00:40:40,00:40:42,Where'd you get that hat?
580,00:40:42,00:40:45,Oh... from a man.
581,00:40:45,00:40:47,He gave me a hundred bucks to get on this train.
582,00:40:47,00:40:49,I don't want no trouble.
583,00:40:50,00:40:52,I mean... don't shoot.
584,00:41:02,00:41:04,"GRISSOM: Maybe, uh..."
585,00:41:04,00:41:08,he came here to kill his ex-wife.
586,00:41:08,00:41:10,(sighs): Why?
587,00:41:12,00:41:13,(cell phone ringing)
588,00:41:14,00:41:15,Grissom.
589,00:41:16,00:41:17,It's Brass.
590,00:41:17,00:41:21,"Listen, the Boulder PD got a call from the principal at the local elementary school."
591,00:41:21,00:41:26,"Gina Farentino was supposed to pick up her son, only she didn't show up."
592,00:41:26,00:41:27,"Yeah, there's a reason for that."
593,00:41:27,00:41:28,She had a son?
594,00:41:28,00:41:29,The kid's name is Kobe.
595,00:41:29,00:41:36,"Yeah, according to the principal, a guy fitting Wicker's description came and picked him up in the mother's car."
596,00:41:36,00:41:38,He said the kid seemed to know him.
597,00:41:38,00:41:40,"Thanks, Jim."
598,00:41:40,00:41:41,(phone beeps off)
599,00:41:46,00:41:48,(opens car door)
600,00:41:50,00:41:52,"Hey, Jack."
601,00:41:54,00:41:56,I don't think that trooper was waving at Gina.
602,00:42:03,00:42:05,"License and registration, sir."
603,00:42:05,00:42:07,I got it right here.
604,00:42:09,00:42:14,"You said the kid who was kidnapped was six years old when he was adopted, birth parents unknown."
605,00:42:14,00:42:16,That's right.
606,00:42:16,00:42:20,Terry Wicker was looking for his ex-wife...
607,00:42:20,00:42:22,And his son.
608,00:42:23,00:42:25,A family reunion.
