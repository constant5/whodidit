1,00:00:20,00:00:21,Hey!
2,00:00:24,00:00:25,"Mom, get down!"
3,00:00:27,00:00:29,I got you covered!
4,00:00:44,00:00:47,Ow! You son of a bitch!
5,00:00:49,00:00:51,(entry bell jingles)
6,00:00:53,00:00:55,(siren whoops)
7,00:00:56,00:00:58,Looks like he took a John Wayne shot.
8,00:00:58,00:01:00,John Wayne shot?
9,00:01:00,00:01:07,"Yeah, the Duke would take one to the shoulder in all his movies, then he'd just shake it off like it was a mosquito bite."
10,00:01:07,00:01:11,"Well, this was more like a spaghetti Western."
11,00:01:11,00:01:14,"Involving Italians, lots of blood."
12,00:01:14,00:01:16,"BRASS: By the way, the guy they wheeled out of here?"
13,00:01:16,00:01:17,That's Hank Rinaldi.
14,00:01:17,00:01:19,He and his mother run the place.
15,00:01:19,00:01:21,A lot of cops like to hang out here.
16,00:01:21,00:01:24,Camera's up there. We'll get tape.
17,00:01:24,00:01:26,And this must be where Hank went down?
18,00:01:26,00:01:28,"BRASS: That's where we found him, curled around his Glock."
19,00:01:28,00:01:30,(cell phone rings)
20,00:01:30,00:01:33,Guessing this is Mom?
21,00:01:34,00:01:36,"BRASS: Yeah, that's Dolores Rinaldi."
22,00:01:36,00:01:38,One tough mother.
23,00:01:39,00:01:40,Go ahead.
24,00:01:40,00:01:43,SANDERS: Multiple gun shot wounds.
25,00:01:43,00:01:45,.45 still gripped.
26,00:01:45,00:01:47,(camera shutter clicking) She went down fighting.
27,00:01:47,00:01:50,"Shooting at him, I'm assuming."
28,00:01:52,00:01:56,"Three gunshot wounds to the torso, one to the head."
29,00:02:02,00:02:05,"Edward Smith, 40."
30,00:02:05,00:02:07,Local address.
31,00:02:10,00:02:13,He's got a fat wad of hundreds in here.
32,00:02:13,00:02:16,Must be at least five grand.
33,00:02:17,00:02:18,(cash register bell dings)
34,00:02:19,00:02:21,Drawer's stocked with cash.
35,00:02:21,00:02:23,There's lots of antiques here.
36,00:02:24,00:02:29,"Lugers, Tokarevs, Old Colts."
37,00:02:29,00:02:31,Some good stuff here.
38,00:02:31,00:02:32,Doesn't look like robbery.
39,00:02:32,00:02:36,"Maybe he was a customer, in here to make a big purchase."
40,00:02:36,00:02:38,(camera shutter clicks)
41,00:02:39,00:02:42,I might've found part of his shopping list.
42,00:02:43,00:02:45,"""101 SW."" Smith &amp; Wesson?"
43,00:02:48,00:02:51,What about these rogue footprints?
44,00:02:51,00:02:52,With the blood here?
45,00:02:54,00:02:56,There must have been someone else here.
46,00:03:03,00:03:06,Look like a small men's size.
47,00:03:06,00:03:08,Nine? Sneakers.
48,00:03:11,00:03:18,"If he walked through the blood pool, he had to have been standing right here."
49,00:03:18,00:03:22,Guy stands in the middle of a three-way shootout and strolls out alive?
50,00:03:24,00:03:30,(shots firing)
51,00:03:31,00:03:33,Was he just lucky?
52,00:03:33,00:03:36,Or bulletproof?
53,00:04:10,00:04:12,(police sirens wailing)
54,00:04:12,00:04:15,(garbled police radio transmission)
55,00:04:25,00:04:26,Hey.
56,00:04:26,00:04:27,Hey. Catherine.
57,00:04:27,00:04:29,Thanks.
58,00:04:29,00:04:30,You're welcome.
59,00:04:32,00:04:34,Body's over here.
60,00:04:36,00:04:40,A couple of teenagers were cutting through the park and spotted her.
61,00:04:40,00:04:42,Thought she was sleeping.
62,00:04:42,00:04:44,Snug as a bug in a rug.
63,00:04:46,00:04:50,"Well, there's a path of displaced gravel coming down the embankment."
64,00:04:50,00:04:52,High-speed body dump?
65,00:04:53,00:04:54,"Well, if it is, then this quilt is awfully clean."
66,00:04:54,00:04:56,"So, how'd it get here?"
67,00:04:56,00:04:58,Covered up after the fact?
68,00:05:02,00:05:05,There's road rash under the blanket.
69,00:05:05,00:05:07,(tires squeal)
70,00:05:10,00:05:11,(heavy thud)
71,00:05:11,00:05:13,VARTANN: Suspect made no attempt to hide her.
72,00:05:13,00:05:16,WILLOWS: Yet he made an effort to tuck her in.
73,00:05:16,00:05:18,"It's oddly tender, huh?"
74,00:05:18,00:05:21,For a body dump.
75,00:05:21,00:05:22,Act of remorse?
76,00:05:23,00:05:24,Maybe our killer has a conscience.
77,00:05:24,00:05:27,I was in the back room.
78,00:05:27,00:05:31,"I heard them arguing, Ma and this guy."
79,00:05:31,00:05:33,"It's the guy in the baseball cap, right?"
80,00:05:33,00:05:35,"No, no. Not him."
81,00:05:35,00:05:37,The other one.
82,00:05:37,00:05:40,The one in the red shirt.
83,00:05:40,00:05:42,(muffled arguing)
84,00:05:48,00:05:50,I didn't get a good look at him.
85,00:05:50,00:05:53,I just started shooting.
86,00:05:53,00:05:55,No! Had to defend my mother.
87,00:05:55,00:05:57,Not that she's ever been a sissy.
88,00:05:57,00:06:01,"And this customer, he starts unloading at the crazy guy, too."
89,00:06:02,00:06:08,"So, this ""guy in a red shirt"" he takes out you, your mother and a customer?"
90,00:06:08,00:06:10,One against three?
91,00:06:10,00:06:12,"Sir, there were a lot of bullets flying."
92,00:06:12,00:06:15,I don't know who hit who.
93,00:07:19,00:07:21,SANDERS: Okay. Here go the lights.
94,00:07:23,00:07:26,The red lasers are customer Ed's shots.
95,00:07:26,00:07:27,(gunshot)
96,00:07:27,00:07:30,These are Delores's shots.
97,00:07:30,00:07:31,(gunshot)
98,00:07:31,00:07:33,And these are Hank's shots.
99,00:07:33,00:07:34,(gunshot)
100,00:07:34,00:07:39,"And according to Hank, the man in the red shirt was everyone's target."
101,00:07:39,00:07:43,"Which is consistent with everyone's trajectories, assuming he was a moving target."
102,00:07:43,00:07:47,But where are Red Shirt's bullets?
103,00:07:47,00:07:50,"Well, all of these shots are misses."
104,00:07:51,00:07:52,Maybe he fired and didn't miss.
105,00:07:52,00:07:56,(cell phone ringing)
106,00:07:56,00:07:59,Langston's out of Autopsy.
107,00:07:59,00:08:00,Ed's ammo killed Dolores.
108,00:08:00,00:08:04,A combination of Dolores' and Hank's ammo killed Ed.
109,00:08:04,00:08:09,And the surgeon pulled one of Ed's nine mils out of Hank's shoulder.
110,00:08:09,00:08:11,"Well, that answers that question."
111,00:08:11,00:08:14,The man in the red shirt never fired.
112,00:08:14,00:08:17,"So, all three shooters missed him and only hit each other?"
113,00:08:17,00:08:22,Warrick and I worked a case once where two guys were shooting at each other in an elevator.
114,00:08:22,00:08:24,Zero out of 25 were hits.
115,00:08:24,00:08:27,But the math is off.
116,00:08:27,00:08:33,"Customer Ed put four of his nine mils into Dolores, one into Hank, and ten into the back wall here."
117,00:08:33,00:08:34,That's 15 shots.
118,00:08:34,00:08:38,And we collected 16 nine mil cases.
119,00:08:39,00:08:40,"So, we're missing a bullet."
120,00:08:40,00:08:43,All of Ed's shots missed in this direction.
121,00:08:43,00:08:48,"And unless it's in Red Shirt, it's got to be in this back wall."
122,00:08:55,00:09:00,Got it. Straight through the wall and into the stock room.
123,00:09:12,00:09:15,Huh. Ed's nine mil.
124,00:09:16,00:09:21,"All projectiles now accounted for, which means Red Shirt wasn't hit."
125,00:09:21,00:09:24,It's hard to believe.
126,00:09:24,00:09:25,(rattling)
127,00:09:25,00:09:28,Doesn't sound like gun oil.
128,00:09:28,00:09:30,This can top's been doctored.
129,00:09:37,00:09:39,At least ten grand here.
130,00:09:39,00:09:42,It's probably the Rinaldis' 401AK.
131,00:09:45,00:09:48,Full-auto sears.
132,00:09:48,00:09:54,"SANDERS: You insert these into the lower receiver of a semi-auto rifle, and you've got yourself a fully automatic machine gun."
133,00:09:55,00:09:56,(shots firing rapidly)
134,00:09:56,00:10:00,"Which is why they're illegal, and fetch a mint on the black market."
135,00:10:00,00:10:03,Two excellent reasons for hiding them.
136,00:10:06,00:10:07,ROBBINS: Ran her prints.
137,00:10:07,00:10:09,Still a Jane Doe.
138,00:10:09,00:10:11,Suffered multiple traumatic events before she died.
139,00:10:12,00:10:14,C.O.D. is no surprise.
140,00:10:14,00:10:17,Disarticulation of the atlantooccipital junction.
141,00:10:17,00:10:19,Consistent with her impact into the rock.
142,00:10:20,00:10:23,"This, however, is the result of a separate incident."
143,00:10:23,00:10:25,Superficial bullet wound.
144,00:10:25,00:10:27,She was shot?
145,00:10:27,00:10:29,Sodium rhodizonate test was positive for lead.
146,00:10:29,00:10:33,The extent of the blood clotting indicates it was antemortem.
147,00:10:33,00:10:35,Shot at least an hour prior to death.
148,00:10:35,00:10:38,"So, he shoots her but doesn't kill her."
149,00:10:38,00:10:41,"Then dumps her out of a car an hour later, which does kill her."
150,00:10:41,00:10:44,Why didn't he just shoot her again?
151,00:10:44,00:10:47,"Well, I saw the crime scene photos."
152,00:10:47,00:10:49,It's only luck of the draw that she hit that rock.
153,00:10:49,00:10:52,Not much logic to it.
154,00:10:52,00:10:59,"Gun shop's camera was out of focus, only took intermittent still shots and was on an oscillating pattern."
155,00:10:59,00:11:02,It's hard to choreograph a less useful record of events.
156,00:11:02,00:11:08,"However, there were two helpful frames before the camera was knocked out by a stray shot."
157,00:11:08,00:11:13,This one shows Ed Smith and Red Shirt walking into the store together.
158,00:11:13,00:11:15,You can't see Red Shirt's face.
159,00:11:16,00:11:18,But it does look like they're together.
160,00:11:18,00:11:20,All right. Now check this out.
161,00:11:21,00:11:24,Hank blasting away at Ed.
162,00:11:24,00:11:25,Red Shirt is in front of Mom.
163,00:11:25,00:11:27,Not even in Hank's line of fire.
164,00:11:27,00:11:30,STOKES: He told Brass he was shooting at Red Shirt.
165,00:11:31,00:11:34,Red Shirt is clearly not Hank's target.
166,00:11:34,00:11:35,Which isn't the only thing Hank lied about.
167,00:11:36,00:11:39,"He told Brass that Ed was just a random, well-armed customer."
168,00:11:39,00:11:41,Ed was another customer all right.
169,00:11:41,00:11:44,His prints were all over the cash with the full-auto sears.
170,00:11:44,00:11:47,Which explains the five grand we found in his wallet.
171,00:11:47,00:11:49,He was there to purchase more sears.
172,00:11:49,00:11:50,From Hank.
173,00:11:50,00:11:54,Whose prints were on both the cash and the sears.
174,00:11:54,00:11:55,"So, Hank's about to make another big sale."
175,00:11:55,00:11:58,Why shoot such a good customer?
176,00:12:00,00:12:06,"Get too greedy for the green stuff, you can get yourself hurt."
177,00:12:06,00:12:11,"We know about your little side business there, Hank, selling the full-auto sears."
178,00:12:11,00:12:13,Which is a federal offense in itself.
179,00:12:13,00:12:17,You pile on the fact that you lied to the cops about killing Ed Smith...
180,00:12:17,00:12:19,He was robbing us!
181,00:12:19,00:12:24,"I was... I was afraid if I told you, you'd take a closer look at him, find out about the sears."
182,00:12:26,00:12:28,"Honestly, I was just defending our store."
183,00:12:28,00:12:34,"(Mom arguing) HANK:I come out of the back, and Ed's got my ma at gunpoint."
184,00:12:34,00:12:35,And not just him. He brought some partner with him.
185,00:12:35,00:12:38,So I did what my mother taught me. Hey! (fires gun)
186,00:12:38,00:12:43,"Guy kills your mom, you're okay saying he died trying to defend her?"
187,00:12:43,00:12:45,Make him out to be a hero?
188,00:12:45,00:12:48,The truth wasn't going to bring her back.
189,00:12:49,00:12:51,And I didn't want to go to jail.
190,00:12:51,00:12:53,(sighs)
191,00:12:53,00:12:55,"So, you caught him, right?"
192,00:12:55,00:12:58,"Ed's wing man, the guy in the red shirt."
193,00:12:58,00:12:59,"You caught him, right?"
194,00:12:59,00:13:00,That's how you learned all this?
195,00:13:00,00:13:02,"Well, actually..."
196,00:13:02,00:13:04,But we're getting close.
197,00:13:04,00:13:05,"Oh, God."
198,00:13:05,00:13:07,What?
199,00:13:07,00:13:09,He's still out there?
200,00:13:09,00:13:14,You got to find him.
201,00:13:14,00:13:18,"That guy, the way he was just standing there with those bullets flying all around?"
202,00:13:18,00:13:20,He was not human.
203,00:13:20,00:13:25,(shots firing)
204,00:13:25,00:13:27,He was like the Terminator.
205,00:13:28,00:13:30,A machine.
206,00:13:30,00:13:33,I've seen my share of crazies.
207,00:13:33,00:13:35,But this guy?
208,00:13:37,00:13:41,Wasn't his first time at the death dance.
209,00:13:41,00:13:46,"As long as he's out there, I'm staying right here."
210,00:13:53,00:13:54,(camera shutter clicks)
211,00:13:58,00:13:59,(camera shutter clicks)
212,00:14:04,00:14:06,(camera shutter clicks)
213,00:14:08,00:14:10,Hey.
214,00:14:11,00:14:13,Car was parked in a loading zone off Industrial.
215,00:14:13,00:14:16,The ticketing officer saw the blood and towed it in.
216,00:14:16,00:14:19,I'm hoping it's related to our body dump.
217,00:14:21,00:14:26,"R.O. is a Carrie Warren of Noelle Lane, Las Vegas."
218,00:14:26,00:14:29,WILLOWS: Is that an I.D. badge?
219,00:14:32,00:14:35,It's our Jane Doe from the ditch.
220,00:14:35,00:14:38,She was dumped from her own car.
221,00:14:38,00:14:42,"Clearly, she wasn't driving."
222,00:14:44,00:14:45,"So, uh..."
223,00:14:45,00:14:47,what's going on with you and Vartann?
224,00:14:49,00:14:51,"I am a trained observer, you know."
225,00:14:51,00:14:55,(chuckles)
226,00:14:55,00:14:58,"Okay. I see it's still in its, uh, early investigative stages."
227,00:14:58,00:15:00,No comment.
228,00:15:03,00:15:05,Huh.
229,00:15:05,00:15:08,Same pattern as the quilt she was wrapped in.
230,00:15:10,00:15:12,Key's still in the ignition.
231,00:15:14,00:15:15,"(key turns, chime sounds)"
232,00:15:15,00:15:16,Out of gas.
233,00:15:16,00:15:20,Explains why the killer left the murder mobile in plain sight.
234,00:15:20,00:15:22,(removes key from ignition)
235,00:15:23,00:15:25,Looks like we have her house keys.
236,00:15:35,00:15:37,LVPD!
237,00:15:37,00:15:39,Anybody home?
238,00:15:41,00:15:42,WILLOWS: How's it look?
239,00:15:44,00:15:47,No sign of forced entry.
240,00:15:47,00:15:49,All Carrie Warren.
241,00:15:51,00:15:53,Looks like she lived alone.
242,00:15:53,00:15:55,SIDLE: I got a blood trail.
243,00:15:55,00:15:58,It's all clear.
244,00:15:58,00:16:00,You're not going to like what you find in the bedroom.
245,00:16:01,00:16:03,I'm going to check the perimeter.
246,00:16:07,00:16:09,Blood spatter on the wall.
247,00:16:09,00:16:11,This is where she was shot.
248,00:16:11,00:16:12,(shutter clicks)
249,00:16:12,00:16:15,Sheets match the quilt she was wrapped in.
250,00:16:22,00:16:26,There's no photos of any humans.
251,00:16:26,00:16:28,But she sure had some love for this German Shepard.
252,00:16:28,00:16:30,Yeah. Roscoe.
253,00:16:30,00:16:32,"Oh, my God."
254,00:16:32,00:16:35,It's Roscoe.
255,00:16:38,00:16:40,(sighs)
256,00:16:46,00:16:48,He was shot.
257,00:16:48,00:16:51,Blood trail ends in the garage.
258,00:16:51,00:16:53,"So, killer's in the bedroom."
259,00:16:54,00:16:55,(dog barking)
260,00:16:55,00:16:56,Shoots the dog.
261,00:16:56,00:16:57,(Carrie screaming)
262,00:16:57,00:16:59,Shoots Carrie.
263,00:17:01,00:17:06,"Takes Carrie and the quilt, and takes her car."
264,00:17:06,00:17:10,"Control, this is 802 Charlie, Detective Vartann."
265,00:17:10,00:17:13,I need Animal Control to transport a dead dog.
266,00:17:13,00:17:14,Carrie's tidy.
267,00:17:14,00:17:19,Strange that she'd leave food trash in the bedroom.
268,00:17:19,00:17:21,Maybe the killer likes milk.
269,00:17:21,00:17:23,Stain on the bed skirt.
270,00:17:23,00:17:26,Milky vomit.
271,00:17:26,00:17:27,I'll get it to DNA.
272,00:17:27,00:17:29,Maybe we'll get lucky on some epithelials.
273,00:17:29,00:17:39,"There's no pictures of any boyfriends, yet she's got a drawer full of tokens of someone's affections."
274,00:17:39,00:17:44,"Hmm. She doesn't want to look at them anymore, but she can't bring herself to throw them away."
275,00:17:44,00:17:47,Maybe Roscoe wasn't the only man in her life.
276,00:17:51,00:17:53,PHILLIPS: Backed over by a car.
277,00:17:53,00:17:55,Fell down a well.
278,00:17:55,00:17:57,Attacked by coyotes.
279,00:17:57,00:17:59,Poisoned by a spider.
280,00:17:59,00:18:03,Lost in a cave.
281,00:18:03,00:18:07,Traded for a Mike Schmidt rookie baseball card.
282,00:18:07,00:18:10,"And my favorite, given to a farm."
283,00:18:10,00:18:12,Allegedly.
284,00:18:12,00:18:15,The tragic fates of the Phillips family dogs.
285,00:18:15,00:18:17,Oh. Mm-hmm.
286,00:18:17,00:18:18,Okay.
287,00:18:18,00:18:20,I'm sorry.
288,00:18:20,00:18:23,I-I extracted a bullet from his dorsal lumbar.
289,00:18:23,00:18:25,Shallow penetration.
290,00:18:25,00:18:28,Lack of vital response in the surrounding tissue indicates he was shot postmortem.
291,00:18:28,00:18:31,"Oh, accounts for the lack of blood at the scene."
292,00:18:31,00:18:33,"No blood pressure, no bleeding."
293,00:18:33,00:18:34,C.O.D.?
294,00:18:34,00:18:35,Undetermined at this point.
295,00:18:35,00:18:38,Huh.
296,00:18:38,00:18:41,Medium caliber bullet flattened on two sides.
297,00:18:41,00:18:44,Double ricochet explains the shallow penetration.
298,00:18:44,00:18:49,And the fact that we have two wounds but just one bullet.
299,00:18:49,00:18:53,I bought my first Ruger 1022 from Rinaldi's.
300,00:18:53,00:18:55,"Oh, sweet."
301,00:18:55,00:18:59,Colt Single Action Army. Beautiful.
302,00:18:59,00:19:01,"Aw, this baby's a shooter, not a collector."
303,00:19:01,00:19:02,Dang it.
304,00:19:02,00:19:04,"Hey, guys. I know you're slammed."
305,00:19:04,00:19:08,This is the round that we pulled from our female victim's German Shepherd.
306,00:19:08,00:19:10,"You're looking for the ""Truth About Gats and Dogs""?"
307,00:19:10,00:19:12,(both chuckle)
308,00:19:12,00:19:14,A little bit of ballistics humor there for you.
309,00:19:14,00:19:18,"See, 7.62 by 25 mil."
310,00:19:18,00:19:21,Only a few rare old makes of gun use this ammo.
311,00:19:21,00:19:24,"Mauser, Tokarev, Norinco."
312,00:19:24,00:19:29,Hold on. We collected a Tokarev from the gun shop.
313,00:19:29,00:19:31,Here it is.
314,00:19:31,00:19:32,(casing clatters)
315,00:19:32,00:19:33,Whoa. Whoa.
316,00:19:33,00:19:36,The case was stuck in the chamber.
317,00:19:36,00:19:38,"You were supposed to clear that at the scene, Greg."
318,00:19:38,00:19:41,"I know, but I got it out of a shattered merchandise case."
319,00:19:41,00:19:44,Guns for sale are supposed to be unloaded by law.
320,00:19:48,00:19:50,It's clear.
321,00:19:50,00:19:53,"Hey, y'all, there's a piece of somebody in here."
322,00:19:53,00:19:54,Must've blocked the slide with their hand.
323,00:19:57,00:20:03,"Now, there is no way Rinaldi's would sell a gun with an expended case in the chamber and a hunk of skin in the slide."
324,00:20:03,00:20:05,Maybe it wasn't for sale.
325,00:20:05,00:20:06,Wait a sec.
326,00:20:06,00:20:15,"If your vic was shot with that gun earlier today, and it wasn't for sale at Rinaldi's, then it stands to reason that your killer brought it there."
327,00:20:15,00:20:20,"There were four players in the shootout, and only three known guns."
328,00:20:20,00:20:24,Maybe the Tokarev belongs to the Man In The Red Shirt.
329,00:20:24,00:20:26,Who's the Man In The Red Shirt?
330,00:20:26,00:20:27,Some guy on a crime spree.
331,00:20:27,00:20:29,"Bobby, can you run the serial number?"
332,00:20:29,00:20:31,Then we need to compare my bullet with your gun.
333,00:20:36,00:20:38,(typing)
334,00:20:42,00:20:45,R.O. is a John Rakow.
335,00:20:45,00:20:46,Guy lives...
336,00:20:46,00:20:49,Right behind Carrie Warren.
337,00:21:04,00:21:08,"Mr. Rakow, I see from your file you served in the military."
338,00:21:08,00:21:11,And you have a Tokarev automatic registered to you?
339,00:21:11,00:21:14,Yeah. I brought that back from 'Nam.
340,00:21:14,00:21:16,That gun saved my ass more than once.
341,00:21:16,00:21:18,"Thank you for your service, Mr. Rakow."
342,00:21:18,00:21:19,You're welcome.
343,00:21:19,00:21:21,Where is the Tokarev now?
344,00:21:21,00:21:23,I gave it to a friend.
345,00:21:23,00:21:25,What's the friend's name?
346,00:21:25,00:21:27,It's a neighbor. Why?
347,00:21:27,00:21:28,Carrie Warren?
348,00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
349,00:21:30,00:21:31,You guys get along?
350,00:21:31,00:21:36,"Well, I ain't particularly crazy about that yappy mutt of hers, but we worked that out."
351,00:21:36,00:21:42,"Mr. Rakow, do you make it a point to arm your entire neighborhood, or just the pretty girls?"
352,00:21:42,00:21:45,I had a daughter once.
353,00:21:47,00:21:48,She was about the age of Carrie.
354,00:21:48,00:21:50,She moved to New York.
355,00:21:50,00:21:55,Young girl all alone in the big city.
356,00:21:55,00:22:00,I wish somebody had looked out after her.
357,00:22:00,00:22:03,So I look out after Carrie; I protect her.
358,00:22:03,00:22:05,Protect her from what?
359,00:22:05,00:22:08,This armpit of a city.
360,00:22:08,00:22:15,"You know, when seconds count, you-- you cops are minutes away."
361,00:22:15,00:22:19,"So you've got a crazy-ass boyfriend, got some screws loose."
362,00:22:19,00:22:22,"She's always breaking up with him, and he's always begging to come back."
363,00:22:22,00:22:24,So how do you fit into all this?
364,00:22:24,00:22:31,"I chased him off a couple times, but I couldn't watch her for 24-7, so I gave her the Tokarev and taught her how to use it."
365,00:22:33,00:22:36,Something happen to Carrie?
366,00:22:36,00:22:38,She's dead.
367,00:22:45,00:22:48,Someone shot her and her yappy mutt with your gun.
368,00:22:51,00:22:53,I'm done talking.
369,00:22:53,00:22:55,"BRASS: Okay, let's talk about something else, then."
370,00:22:55,00:22:57,What about the boyfriend?
371,00:22:57,00:22:58,Has he got a name?
372,00:22:58,00:23:00,Dirtbag.
373,00:23:00,00:23:05,And I can't recall his last name.
374,00:23:21,00:23:25,The man is wearing boots as big as all of Texas.
375,00:23:25,00:23:31,There's no way he could cram those dogs into size-nine sneakers.
376,00:23:31,00:23:34,"Plus, I observed his hands; there's no slide bite."
377,00:23:34,00:23:35,He didn't shoot Carrie.
378,00:23:35,00:23:37,He wasn't in the gun shop.
379,00:23:37,00:23:39,He's not the man in the red shirt.
380,00:23:40,00:23:43,ANDREWS: I got Roscoe's tox panel.
381,00:23:43,00:23:45,Your German Shepherd was poisoned.
382,00:23:45,00:23:49,High concentrations of lorazepam and diazepam in his blood.
383,00:23:49,00:23:53,Found the same anti-anxiety drugs in the milk you collected from the bedroom.
384,00:23:53,00:23:57,"So, based on his stomach contents, Carrie's dog drank the poison milk."
385,00:23:57,00:23:58,What about Carrie's tox?
386,00:23:58,00:24:00,She was clean. Stomach was empty.
387,00:24:00,00:24:03,No milk. We didn't find any prescriptions at Carrie's house.
388,00:24:03,00:24:05,Red Shirt had to have brought the drugs with him.
389,00:24:05,00:24:09,So he dissolved them in milk and feeds them to the dog?
390,00:24:13,00:24:19,"The dog apparently regurgitated some of the mixture onto the bedskirt, but not enough to save his life."
391,00:24:19,00:24:22,"The killer premeditates the dog's murder, but not Carrie's?"
392,00:24:22,00:24:24,Not necessarily.
393,00:24:24,00:24:26,He poisons the dog to shut it up.
394,00:24:26,00:24:29,"Waits for her to come home, then shoots her with her own gun."
395,00:24:29,00:24:32,"Well, if that's true, he knew her. He knew her dog."
396,00:24:32,00:24:34,He knew where she kept the gun.
397,00:24:34,00:24:36,No signs of forced entry.
398,00:24:36,00:24:38,He had to have a key.
399,00:24:38,00:24:41,Obvious question-- she have a boyfriend?
400,00:24:41,00:24:42,"Oh, yeah."
401,00:24:42,00:24:45,And I'm betting he has a red shirt.
402,00:24:46,00:24:50,"I mean, is this what women really want?"
403,00:24:50,00:24:54,It's what men think women want.
404,00:24:54,00:24:56,Like candy.
405,00:24:56,00:25:01,"It's sweet and hard to resist, but sooner or later, we just want some meat and potatoes."
406,00:25:01,00:25:04,(gravelly voice): All the women I take out just order a salad.
407,00:25:04,00:25:08,"(laughs) God, I used to have drawers full of this crap from guys."
408,00:25:09,00:25:15,Now I just want a man I can count on.
409,00:25:15,00:25:23,"""My eternal love is yours in life and in death. Forever, Sam."" That sure sounds like a boyfriend."
410,00:25:23,00:25:30,"Although I never wrote a love poem to a girl that included the word ""death."" There's something under that label."
411,00:25:41,00:25:46,Sam gift-lifted this book from a public library and gave it to his beloved.
412,00:25:46,00:25:48,Classy.
413,00:25:48,00:25:51,Call the library and find out who the last borrower was.
414,00:26:38,00:26:41,(knocking)
415,00:26:48,00:26:51,Las Vegas Police. Anybody home?
416,00:26:51,00:26:54,(football game playing on TV)
417,00:26:54,00:26:55,"Go, go, go, go, go. Hold."
418,00:26:55,00:26:56,Who are you?
419,00:26:57,00:26:59,"I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
420,00:26:59,00:27:00,We're looking for Sam Trent. Who are you?
421,00:27:00,00:27:03,"I'm Paul Trent, his father. He's not home."
422,00:27:04,00:27:06,"What happened here, Mr. Trent?"
423,00:27:06,00:27:09,It was an accident.
424,00:27:09,00:27:11,BRASS: Any idea where Sam is?
425,00:27:11,00:27:14,My son's 27. I don't interfere with his personal life.
426,00:27:14,00:27:16,"Well, we do. We have a warrant to search your house."
427,00:27:16,00:27:17,What's this about?
428,00:27:18,00:27:19,An overdue library book.
429,00:27:21,00:27:23,"Mr. Trent, I need you to come with me."
430,00:27:29,00:27:32,Another accident. Mm-hmm.
431,00:27:42,00:27:44,"SIDLE: Styron, Plath, Sexton."
432,00:27:44,00:27:46,Looks like a reading list from Morbid 101.
433,00:27:48,00:27:51,Taste in cinema appears to be much lighter.
434,00:27:51,00:27:54,These are all romantic comedies.
435,00:27:54,00:27:58,SIDLE: With the kind of guy who never gives up until he wins the heart of his dream girl?
436,00:27:58,00:28:01,"Of course, Sam's dream girl is dead."
437,00:28:08,00:28:11,A photograph of Sam and Carrie.
438,00:28:11,00:28:13,Proves they were together. Mm-hmm.
439,00:28:13,00:28:17,Does this look like it was taken from the top of the Stratosphere to you?
440,00:28:17,00:28:20,"No, it's not high enough."
441,00:28:20,00:28:22,It's got to be the Ivory Tower Skydeck.
442,00:28:23,00:28:27,It's kind of a dumpy old tourist trap with a nice view of the methadone clinic across the street.
443,00:28:27,00:28:29,I'll take you there sometime.
444,00:28:29,00:28:32,"Gee, thanks."
445,00:28:33,00:28:35,I have...
446,00:28:35,00:28:43,at least a dozen ticket stubs to the Skydeck.
447,00:28:43,00:28:46,Maybe it was Sam and Carrie's favorite place.
448,00:28:46,00:28:48,Eight bucks a pop.
449,00:28:48,00:28:50,What do you have?
450,00:28:50,00:28:53,Letters.
451,00:28:53,00:29:00,"""Sam, meeting you up there, the city sprawling below us, changed my life."" This is five days later."
452,00:29:01,00:29:06,"""Sam, I'm sorry, but I can't be with you anymore."" And then a few days after that."
453,00:29:06,00:29:10,"""I can't stop thinking about you."" ""I need you."
454,00:29:10,00:29:17,"You're the best thing that ever happened to me."" ""Sam, I hope we can always be friends."" Light-switch romance."
455,00:29:17,00:29:19,On and off.
456,00:29:19,00:29:21,"Well, this is from last week."
457,00:29:21,00:29:23,"""You need to respect my boundaries, Sam."
458,00:29:23,00:29:29,"It's over. Leave me alone, or my neighbor will kick your ass."" Good neighbor John Rakow?"
459,00:29:35,00:29:38,Diazepam.
460,00:29:38,00:29:40,Lorazepam.
461,00:29:40,00:29:43,Both scripts written last week.
462,00:29:43,00:29:45,Both empty.
463,00:29:45,00:29:46,That's what killed Carrie's dog.
464,00:29:46,00:29:48,Mm.
465,00:29:49,00:29:54,Some other... letters here.
466,00:29:54,00:29:58,This one...
467,00:29:58,00:30:00,written two days ago.
468,00:30:00,00:30:01,From Sam to Carrie.
469,00:30:01,00:30:03,Looks like an early draft.
470,00:30:03,00:30:05,"""Carrie, we have talked about this."
471,00:30:05,00:30:09,"""I know talking is easier than going through with it."
472,00:30:09,00:30:12,"""But after the darkness comes the light."
473,00:30:12,00:30:23,"""In a painless moment we can be together forever."" That sounds like an invitation to a suicide pact."
474,00:30:23,00:30:26,She's dead.
475,00:30:26,00:30:29,Did he change his mind?
476,00:30:37,00:30:40,You have the results from the Carrie Warren scene? I do.
477,00:30:40,00:30:43,There was DNA on the lip of the tainted milk bottle.
478,00:30:43,00:30:47,And I just matched it to Sam Trent's toothbrush that was sent over from his house.
479,00:30:47,00:30:49,Sam drank the poisoned milk? Yeah.
480,00:30:49,00:30:53,"Which is why I then ran the vomit, and it turns out it wasn't actually the dog's."
481,00:30:53,00:30:55,The mucosal cells were a match to Sam.
482,00:30:55,00:30:59,Sam tried to commit suicide in Carrie's bedroom but failed? Mm-hmm.
483,00:30:59,00:31:01,(sighs) What about the tissue from the gun?
484,00:31:01,00:31:04,(machine beeps) Just came up.
485,00:31:12,00:31:14,It's Carrie Warren.
486,00:31:14,00:31:16,You're joking.
487,00:31:17,00:31:20,She shot herself?
488,00:31:46,00:31:51,The physical evidence now supports the suicide pact theory.
489,00:31:51,00:31:55,"Only Sam didn't die from the poison, and Carrie didn't die from the gunshot."
490,00:31:55,00:31:57,"Okay, check this out."
491,00:31:57,00:31:59,This is Carrie's house.
492,00:31:59,00:32:01,This is where we found the body.
493,00:32:01,00:32:05,This is where you found her car.
494,00:32:05,00:32:06,And this is Rinaldi's Gun &amp; Ammo.
495,00:32:06,00:32:12,"I think that Sam took the gun and Carrie, got in her car, and I think he was headed for the gun shop."
496,00:32:12,00:32:13,The gun was jammed.
497,00:32:13,00:32:18,"It wasn't his gun, so maybe he thought it ran out of ammo."
498,00:32:18,00:32:21,"He needed more bullets, so he could finish them both off."
499,00:32:21,00:32:25,"Okay, so why did he dump her on the side of the road on the way to the gun shop?"
500,00:32:25,00:32:31,"Well, Carrie was dumped at the apex of a hairpin turn."
501,00:32:31,00:32:38,"And a piece of the quilt was in the passenger door latch, which could have prevented the door from fully closing."
502,00:32:41,00:32:42,(tires screeching)
503,00:32:43,00:32:47,"I mean, an accident would explain why he wrapped her in a quilt."
504,00:33:12,00:33:14,Nothing was going according to plan.
505,00:33:14,00:33:16,"She's dead, he's not."
506,00:33:16,00:33:19,He's probably feeling left behind.
507,00:33:19,00:33:22,"Yeah, and now he really needs to get to that gun shop."
508,00:33:22,00:33:25,"So when the car runs out of gas, he just walks the rest of the way."
509,00:33:25,00:33:31,"Suicidal guy enters a gun shop, desperate for another bullet to pop into his Tokarev."
510,00:33:31,00:33:35,"If they're not going to give one to him, maybe they'll shoot one at him."
511,00:33:35,00:33:39,"Mm. So somehow, Sam triggered the gunfight."
512,00:33:39,00:33:43,"Just his luck, he's the only one that walks out of there unscathed."
513,00:33:48,00:33:49,(door rattling)
514,00:33:54,00:33:56,Sara...
515,00:33:56,00:33:58,the closet door's been kicked in.
516,00:33:58,00:34:01,I don't think Sam did this.
517,00:34:01,00:34:05,Does that look like a cowboy boot to you?
518,00:34:05,00:34:07,Texas-sized.
519,00:34:07,00:34:14,"Mr. Trent, if you want to try to help us save your son's life, you've got to tell me what happened in your house."
520,00:34:19,00:34:22,There was a knock at the door.
521,00:34:22,00:34:25,I barely heard it over the TV.
522,00:34:25,00:34:27,When I went to answer it...
523,00:34:27,00:34:29,(football game playing on TV)
524,00:34:29,00:34:30,(door banging)
525,00:34:31,00:34:33,(glass shattering)
526,00:34:33,00:34:36,"Sam Trent, where is he? Where is he?! (gun cocks)"
527,00:34:40,00:34:42,"Sam, you son of a bitch!"
528,00:34:44,00:34:47,"When he didn't find Sam, he trashed the place and stormed out."
529,00:34:47,00:34:50,"A couple minutes later, Sammy came home."
530,00:34:53,00:34:57,"Sammy... Sammy, what happened?"
531,00:34:57,00:34:59,Are you in trouble?
532,00:34:59,00:35:01,There was a man here.
533,00:35:01,00:35:02,I... I almost called the police.
534,00:35:02,00:35:04,"No police, Dad."
535,00:35:04,00:35:06,Everything's gonna be fine.
536,00:35:06,00:35:09,Take my car. The guy had a gun.
537,00:35:09,00:35:12,"Go on, t-take my keys, grab-grab my wallet."
538,00:35:12,00:35:14,Take what you need.
539,00:35:15,00:35:16,"Thanks, Dad."
540,00:35:22,00:35:25,Sam only wanted eight dollars from his father?
541,00:35:25,00:35:28,The price of an Ivory Tower Skydeck ticket.
542,00:35:37,00:35:39,"Hey, you-you can't park here."
543,00:35:46,00:35:48,I just received Carrie Warren's medical records.
544,00:35:48,00:35:58,"She had a history of bipolar disorder for which she was recently was being treated at St. Anthony's Hospital, 101 Southwest Harmony Avenue."
545,00:35:58,00:36:00,101 S.W.
546,00:36:00,00:36:03,The shopping list from the gun shop. Yeah.
547,00:36:03,00:36:04,It was an address.
548,00:36:05,00:36:09,Uh-huh. We just assumed that he was driving Carrie to the gun shop.
549,00:36:09,00:36:11,This is her house...
550,00:36:11,00:36:13,"body, car."
551,00:36:13,00:36:15,There's the gun shop.
552,00:36:15,00:36:17,And just to the west of it...
553,00:36:17,00:36:20,St. Anthony's.
554,00:36:20,00:36:23,He was headed for the hospital.
555,00:36:23,00:36:25,Sam was trying to save her life.
556,00:36:45,00:36:47,(lively chatter)
557,00:36:54,00:36:57,(wind whistling)
558,00:36:57,00:36:59,(vehicles passing below)
559,00:37:11,00:37:13,(distant car alarm blaring)
560,00:37:22,00:37:25,(sirens wailing)
561,00:37:27,00:37:28,(siren whoops)
562,00:37:31,00:37:36,"Control, officers are moving into position (cell phone rings) at the Ivory Tower."
563,00:37:36,00:37:39,I need a full rescue- team response.
564,00:37:39,00:37:40,Detective Vartann and a police officer are already up there.
565,00:37:41,00:37:42,You're free to go up.
566,00:37:42,00:37:44,I don't want any heroes up there.
567,00:37:44,00:37:46,"Can you hear me, Catherine?"
568,00:37:55,00:37:56,You son of a bitch!
569,00:37:56,00:37:58,"You're a dead man, Sam Trent! (grunts)"
570,00:37:58,00:38:01,(gasping): One would think.
571,00:38:01,00:38:02,(gun cocks)
572,00:38:02,00:38:04,"Police, drop the weapon! Drop it!"
573,00:38:04,00:38:06,"John, Sam didn't shoot Carrie."
574,00:38:06,00:38:11,"You're lying! We found her skin in the Tokarev slide. John, you know what that means? I know you do."
575,00:38:11,00:38:12,"Carrie shot herself. No, you're lying."
576,00:38:12,00:38:13,She wouldn't do that.
577,00:38:13,00:38:15,"John, Carrie was bipolar."
578,00:38:15,00:38:17,She'd attempted suicide before.
579,00:38:17,00:38:21,"You told me that Carrie needed protection, but it wasn't from Sam, it was from herself."
580,00:38:21,00:38:23,"That's not true, John. I killed her."
581,00:38:23,00:38:24,You shut up!
582,00:38:24,00:38:26,I put the gun to her head.
583,00:38:26,00:38:28,I brushed away... LANGSTON: Sam stop.
584,00:38:28,00:38:30,"I brushed away her hair, I looked into her eyes..."
585,00:38:30,00:38:31,and I just...
586,00:38:31,00:38:35,"LANGSTON: John, after Carrie shot herself, Sam took her to the hospital."
587,00:38:35,00:38:37,"No, that's not true! I killed her, John."
588,00:38:37,00:38:41,We found a note with the address to St. Anthony's on it.
589,00:38:41,00:38:44,"SARA: Sam, you loved Carrie."
590,00:38:44,00:38:47,You tried to save her.
591,00:38:52,00:38:53,(uncocks gun)
592,00:38:55,00:38:56,Sam!
593,00:38:56,00:38:58,You don't have to die today!
594,00:38:58,00:39:00,This is meant to be.
595,00:39:00,00:39:01,You don't have to die today.
596,00:39:01,00:39:05,The last two people who tried to stop me ended up dead.
597,00:39:05,00:39:07,"Just give me one bullet, okay?"
598,00:39:07,00:39:09,Just one bullet. Whatever this takes!
599,00:39:09,00:39:10,(laughs)
600,00:39:10,00:39:12,Just give me one bullet! No...
601,00:39:12,00:39:14,(gunshots) Hey!
602,00:39:14,00:39:18,This is where Carrie and I met.
603,00:39:18,00:39:21,And this is where it's destined to end.
604,00:39:21,00:39:22,It doesn't have to end here.
605,00:39:22,00:39:24,We know about the pact.
606,00:39:25,00:39:27,We know you tried to save her.
607,00:39:27,00:39:31,"And Carrie, she would want us to save you."
608,00:39:34,00:39:36,"Okay, but I have one question."
609,00:39:36,00:39:39,Was it me or the dog?
610,00:39:39,00:39:42,What do you mean?
611,00:39:42,00:39:47,"It wasn't, I mean, it wasn't technically a pact."
612,00:39:50,00:39:53,I wanted her to come home and find me.
613,00:39:53,00:39:58,My whole being rendered solemn valentine.
614,00:39:58,00:40:00,(dog whining)
615,00:40:04,00:40:06,(gunshot)
616,00:40:13,00:40:15,There was milk all over its snout.
617,00:40:26,00:40:28,Carrie loved that dog.
618,00:40:28,00:40:37,"And when she came home and found him, was it the sight of me or the dog that made her pull the trigger?"
619,00:40:37,00:40:39,"It was you, Sam."
620,00:40:39,00:40:41,I'm sure it was you.
621,00:40:41,00:40:44,So nice of you to say that.
622,00:40:45,00:40:47,SIDLE: Sam!
623,00:41:11,00:41:13,(sirens wailing)
624,00:41:21,00:41:23,Situation is Code Four.
625,00:41:23,00:41:24,One in custody.
