1	00:00:10	00:00:13	...they will generally eat any meat that is available...
2	00:00:30	00:00:32	I can't believe that, man.
3	00:01:20	00:01:23	...a wolf's feeding requirements is 1.5 tons of meat.
4	00:01:32	00:01:34	Oh, my God.
5	00:01:35	00:01:37	Oh, man. Oh, man.
6	00:01:37	00:01:42	Security, we've got an emergency in the-the west garden.
7	00:01:42	00:01:45	Send help, please. Hurry.
8	00:01:47	00:01:51	My supervisor's, uh, going through all the video feeds.
9	00:01:51	00:01:56	If we got her face on one of our cameras, uh, you guys are going to have it.
10	00:01:56	00:02:00	You better pray that she doesn't have a family that's going to sue you and this whole joint for gross negligence.
11	00:02:00	00:02:01	Take a hike. Go with him.
12	00:02:01	00:02:03	Hello, this is Dr. Langston.
13	00:02:03	00:02:04	Leave a message.
14	00:02:04	00:02:07	Yeah, hey, Ray. It's Jim Brass.
15	00:02:07	00:02:10	Weren't you supposed to be here at my 420 about an hour ago?
16	00:02:10	00:02:12	Where the hell are you?
17	00:02:18	00:02:20	Have you seen this woman, sir?
18	00:02:20	00:02:21	No, I haven't.
19	00:02:22	00:02:25	How about you? Have you seen this woman? No.
20	00:02:25	00:02:26	How about you, ladies?
21	00:02:26	00:02:27	Hey, big fella.
22	00:02:27	00:02:29	You want to party?
23	00:02:29	00:02:31	I'm looking for this woman. Her name is Madeline Briggs.
24	00:02:31	00:02:33	Cop. I'm not a cop.
25	00:02:33	00:02:34	I'm not here to arrest anyone.
26	00:02:34	00:02:37	I just want to know if you've seen this woman.
27	00:02:37	00:02:39	I seen lots of people.
28	00:02:39	00:02:41	What about her? Have you seen her?
29	00:02:41	00:02:44	Sorry. She's too pretty to be a track ho.
30	00:02:44	00:02:47	Um, you think you could spare some frog skins?
31	00:02:48	00:02:50	I ain't eaten since yesterday.
32	00:02:50	00:02:52	That's a pretty bad rash you have.
33	00:02:52	00:02:54	I work at a clinic.
34	00:02:54	00:02:55	(siren chirps) It's not too far from here.
35	00:02:55	00:02:58	If you want to come over and have that looked at...
36	00:02:59	00:03:00	Dr. Ray.
37	00:03:00	00:03:02	Yeah? You got your phone?
38	00:03:02	00:03:03	Yeah, yeah. Right here.
39	00:03:03	00:03:05	Did you forget how to use it?
40	00:03:05	00:03:07	You were nonresponsive.
41	00:03:07	00:03:09	I thought you were in trouble, man.
42	00:03:09	00:03:10	Don't scare me like that.
43	00:03:10	00:03:11	I'm sorry.
44	00:03:11	00:03:15	That's okay, but if you really want to hide out, you gotta ditch the department cell.
45	00:03:15	00:03:17	They all have GPS.
46	00:03:17	00:03:18	What are you doing out here?
47	00:03:18	00:03:20	That's what I'm doing out here.
48	00:03:20	00:03:21	Madeline Briggs?
49	00:03:22	00:03:24	Madeline Briggs, yeah.
50	00:03:24	00:03:26	You been back for ten days.
51	00:03:26	00:03:28	Is this what you've been doing every night?
52	00:03:28	00:03:30	I thought the trail went cold in New York.
53	00:03:30	00:03:31	It did.
54	00:03:34	00:03:37	This picture was taken a week ago at Pecos Bill Casino.
55	00:03:37	00:03:40	Security trespassed her off the property for soliciting.
56	00:03:40	00:03:42	She's here, Nick. She's hooking.
57	00:03:42	00:03:44	Have you been in contact with her mother?
58	00:03:44	00:03:48	Not since New York, but I told this woman I would do everything I could to find her daughter.
59	00:03:49	00:03:52	So... here I am.
60	00:03:52	00:03:55	All right, tell you what.
61	00:03:55	00:03:58	Let's take care of the call-out first.
62	00:03:58	00:04:01	Then after shift, hey, I'll come back out here with you.
63	00:04:01	00:04:03	We'll pass out some pictures together, okay?
64	00:04:03	00:04:05	Okay. Okay. Come on.
65	00:04:14	00:04:16	Okay, boys, what's happening?
66	00:04:16	00:04:18	I mean, you know... I don't know.
67	00:04:18	00:04:19	Is everybody moving in slow-motion?
68	00:04:19	00:04:20	The coroner's not even here yet.
69	00:04:20	00:04:22	Sorry. We, uh, we got held up. What's going on?
70	00:04:22	00:04:29	We got a dead woman, no I.D. in her purse, $40 in cash, half a dozen condoms, a few roofies, and some baby wipes.
71	00:04:30	00:04:31	What does that tell you?
72	00:04:31	00:04:32	Standard hooker tool kit.
73	00:04:32	00:04:35	$20 for cab fare, $20 for the bartender to look the other way.
74	00:04:35	00:04:38	Which means she probably hasn't tricked yet.
75	00:04:38	00:04:41	Well, it looks like word's already gotten out on the ho-vine.
76	00:04:41	00:04:48	The ho-vine? Yeah, you know, when the hookers get wind the cops are here, they start texting each other like mad and then they, they book out of here like a shot.
77	00:04:48	00:04:52	So I'm going to go catch up with them, see if I can get some information. I'm out.
78	00:04:52	00:04:53	All right.
79	00:04:53	00:04:56	Okay.
80	00:04:56	00:04:58	Throat is cut clean, linear.
81	00:04:58	00:05:02	My guess would be a straight razor severed the common carotid.
82	00:05:02	00:05:04	There're a lot of ways in and out of here.
83	00:05:04	00:05:06	Killer could have come from any direction.
84	00:05:10	00:05:14	Arterial spurt like this, usually they at least get some blood on their shoes.
85	00:05:14	00:05:16	I don't see any tread marks.
86	00:05:16	00:05:18	Hey, guys.
87	00:05:18	00:05:19	I'm so sorry I'm late.
88	00:05:19	00:05:22	I was on that biker shoot-out up in Pahrump.
89	00:05:22	00:05:23	Lots of gurney work.
90	00:05:23	00:05:25	It's all right, David.
91	00:05:25	00:05:26	Whoa!
92	00:05:26	00:05:28	This is Dede Chase.
93	00:05:28	00:05:29	Who?
94	00:05:29	00:05:33	Dede Chase. She's the, uh, meteorologist on Channel 27 in Barstow.
95	00:05:33	00:05:35	You sure about that? Definitely.
96	00:05:35	00:05:37	Why do you watch the weather in Barstow?
97	00:05:37	00:05:39	Dede always made me laugh.
98	00:05:39	00:05:41	She was kind of daffy, you know?
99	00:05:41	00:05:46	What's a weather girl from Barstow doing turning tricks in Las Vegas?
100	00:05:46	00:05:49	These days...
101	00:05:49	00:05:52	seems like everybody has a second job.
102	00:05:52	00:05:58	Captioning sponsored by CBS, C.S.I. PRODUCTIONS, and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
103	00:06:24	00:06:26	Took a lot of makeup to cover these bruises.
104	00:06:27	00:06:28	I collected the SAE kit.
105	00:06:29	00:06:35	00 and 4 consistent with violent sexual activity.
106	00:06:35	00:06:40	And the wet mount was negative, so no DNA on whoever she was with.
107	00:06:40	00:06:43	Lots of purplish-blue contusions.
108	00:06:43	00:06:47	Somebody worked her over pretty good, most likely within the last day or two.
109	00:06:47	00:06:49	Tat is still fresh, too.
110	00:06:49	00:06:51	Skin's still inflamed.
111	00:06:51	00:06:53	Ink can't be more than 48 hours old.
112	00:06:53	00:06:56	Guys, take a look at this.
113	00:06:59	00:07:08	Oh, we have a fabulous weekend ahead of us with highs in the upper 70s, lows in the mid-40s, though, so bring a jacket if you'll be staying out late. I know I will be.
114	00:07:08	00:07:09	That's your high desert weather.
115	00:07:09	00:07:11	I'm Dede Kase. Chase.
116	00:07:11	00:07:13	D... Dede Chase.
117	00:07:13	00:07:17	Wow, of all the things to screw up, I choose my own name.
118	00:07:17	00:07:19	I'm Dede... Chase.
119	00:07:19	00:07:23	I think. I'm sorry, but I don't believe Dede was a hooker.
120	00:07:23	00:07:27	Maybe she just liked things a little dangerous.
121	00:07:27	00:07:32	Well, certainly wouldn't be the first time a good girl starts looking for love in all the wrong places.
122	00:07:32	00:07:36	There is blood on this earring.
123	00:07:36	00:07:39	But I only saw blood on that side of her face.
124	00:07:39	00:07:41	Well, straight razors are hard to handle.
125	00:07:41	00:07:42	People cut themselves with them all the time.
126	00:07:43	00:07:44	So, this blood could be the killer's.
127	00:07:44	00:07:46	Mmm. Swab it.
128	00:07:46	00:07:49	There's no image of the killer.
129	00:07:49	00:07:51	The camera is completely blocked.
130	00:07:51	00:07:52	Can we see how she got there? Yes.
131	00:07:52	00:07:56	Tangiers surveillance was very cooperative.
132	00:07:58	00:08:00	We know who that is?
133	00:08:00	00:08:01	Now, don't get excited.
134	00:08:01	00:08:05	He's on surveillance playing roulette at the time of the murder.
135	00:08:05	00:08:06	He's a hotel guest.
136	00:08:06	00:08:07	Brass took his statement.
137	00:08:07	00:08:12	He said he picked the girl up at the bar, they went upstairs, and she split.
138	00:08:12	00:08:16	Now, this is the earliest we can put Dede Chase in the hotel.
139	00:08:16	00:08:21	Okay... so she meets a guy in the bar, they head up to his room.
140	00:08:21	00:08:26	Right. There's no sign of violence, no argument, nothing inconsistent with a woman out for a fling.
141	00:08:28	00:08:31	That elevator is in the south tower.
142	00:08:31	00:08:33	She came down the elevator in the north tower.
143	00:08:34	00:08:37	Means she ran all the way across the hotel just to leave?
144	00:08:37	00:08:40	But if she got cold feet, why not just take the next car down?
145	00:08:40	00:08:41	That's a good question.
146	00:08:43	00:08:47	You know, maybe this pickup in the bar was a cover.
147	00:08:47	00:08:49	Maybe she was running from somebody.
148	00:08:49	00:08:52	Somebody who was already down there waiting for her.
149	00:08:52	00:08:56	If you're going to have me keep doing Archie's job, I'm going to need a raise.
150	00:08:56	00:08:58	Let me know what Ecklie says to that.
151	00:08:58	00:09:01	I was hoping you'd ask, Herr Supervisor.
152	00:09:01	00:09:02	Yeah, well, it's good to, uh...
153	00:09:02	00:09:04	it's good to hope for things.
154	00:09:06	00:09:08	Here's the dump on your vic's cell phone.
155	00:09:08	00:09:16	In the three days prior to her death, she received 28 phone calls from a cell phone out of Barstow, registered to one Brett McDowell.
156	00:09:16	00:09:19	I wonder if he's the jealous, violent type.
157	00:09:19	00:09:21	Well, shouldn't be hard to find out.
158	00:09:21	00:09:22	I trapped his plastic.
159	00:09:22	00:09:25	His credit card was just run at the Four Kings.
160	00:09:25	00:09:27	He's in town.
161	00:09:34	00:09:37	Enjoying your time in Vegas, Mr. McDowell?
162	00:09:37	00:09:38	Uh, yeah, I guess.
163	00:09:38	00:09:40	What is this about?
164	00:09:40	00:09:41	What's your relationship to Dede Chase?
165	00:09:41	00:09:42	We're colleagues.
166	00:09:42	00:09:44	I'm her producer.
167	00:09:44	00:09:45	Were you banging her?
168	00:09:45	00:09:47	(scoffs) Excuse me?
169	00:09:47	00:09:48	Listen to this.
170	00:09:48	00:09:50	Dede, damn it, you do not call my house.
171	00:09:50	00:09:53	You do it ever again, and I promise you there will be consequences.
172	00:09:53	00:09:56	There's a lot more like this on this tape.
173	00:09:56	00:09:59	Now, I see that you've, uh, taken off your wedding ring recently.
174	00:09:59	00:10:00	So, you're married.
175	00:10:00	00:10:02	Does your wife know about these phone calls?
176	00:10:02	00:10:04	Okay. Okay.
177	00:10:04	00:10:08	Look, uh, Dede and I were having an affair.
178	00:10:08	00:10:09	That's a good place to start.
179	00:10:09	00:10:11	We came to Vegas to resolve a few issues.
180	00:10:11	00:10:14	She wanted me to get a divorce, and, you know, I couldn't afford that, so...
181	00:10:14	00:10:16	When was the last time you saw her?
182	00:10:16	00:10:17	Three nights ago.
183	00:10:17	00:10:19	Where was that?
184	00:10:19	00:10:20	On the street.
185	00:10:20	00:10:23	Yeah. BRETT I want you out now.
186	00:10:24	00:10:26	Oh! Well, why don't you just go to hell!
187	00:10:26	00:10:28	Just go to hell while you're at it!
188	00:10:28	00:10:29	Why don't you just do that?
189	00:10:32	00:10:34	She told me to go to hell, so I drove back to Barstow.
190	00:10:34	00:10:37	So, you left her on a street corner in a strange town, all by herself?
191	00:10:37	00:10:38	That's why I came back.
192	00:10:39	00:10:40	I got worried, you know.
193	00:10:40	00:10:43	She didn't show up to work, and she wasn't returning any of my calls.
194	00:10:43	00:10:45	Well, she had a good reason.
195	00:10:45	00:10:53	You thought she was going to make good on her threat and send your marriage and half your assets down the toilet, so you decided to cut your losses along with her throat-- is that what you did?
196	00:10:53	00:10:55	I would never do anything like that. I swear.
197	00:10:55	00:10:56	I'm going to need your DNA.
198	00:10:56	00:11:01	I'm going to need a list of all the people you met when you were here and all the places you went.
199	00:11:02	00:11:05	That means bars, restaurants, hotels, tattoo parlors, clubs.
200	00:11:06	00:11:08	Tattoo parlors? What are you talking about?
201	00:11:08	00:11:11	Well, there is some evidence that she got a tattoo in the last two days.
202	00:11:11	00:11:12	She hated tattoos.
203	00:11:13	00:11:15	She thought they made women look cheap.
204	00:11:53	00:11:54	Ray. Yeah?
205	00:11:54	00:11:56	I think you need to see this. What is it?
206	00:11:56	00:11:59	The DNA from the blood on the weather girl's earring-- it wasn't hers, it wasn't Brett McDowell's.
207	00:11:59	00:12:02	It's Madeline Briggs.
208	00:12:09	00:12:11	Okay, Madeline Briggs and Dede Chase-- what's the connection?
209	00:12:11	00:12:15	Madeline Briggs fell prey to an interstate human trafficking ring.
210	00:12:15	00:12:19	Took her from Miami to New York to Las Vegas, where she was probably forced into prostitution.
211	00:12:19	00:12:25	Her blood was found on an earring worn by Dede Chase, a TV weather girl from Barstow.
212	00:12:25	00:12:32	Who ended up with her throat slit in the Tangiers garden, sporting a new tattoo associated with known prostitutes.
213	00:12:32	00:12:36	So, how did she cross paths with Madeline?
214	00:12:36	00:12:40	Well, you said that the earring belonged to Madeline, right?
215	00:12:40	00:12:44	Right. Well, if she and Dede were sharing jewelry, it suggests they were living together.
216	00:12:44	00:12:46	So, maybe they had the same pimp.
217	00:12:46	00:12:49	Possibly, but the Vice tattoo database didn't I.D. the pimp.
218	00:12:49	00:12:52	What's today's date?
219	00:12:52	00:12:53	The 15th.
220	00:12:53	00:12:57	Why? I think I know where we can find a lot of pimps tonight.
221	00:13:05	00:13:09	By all means, LVPD, feel free to look around.
222	00:13:10	00:13:13	But we ain't got none of them real-life, lawbreaking kind of pimps in here.
223	00:13:13	00:13:16	This here is DJ Tall-K's PlayerCon.
224	00:13:16	00:13:17	No, right, I understand.
225	00:13:17	00:13:21	This is, uh-- technically speaking-- just an elaborate costume party.
226	00:13:21	00:13:27	...peoples, it's my honor to present the Golden Pimp Award to DJ Slickbone!
227	00:13:29	00:13:35	All right, y'all, give it up for Daddy of the Year!
228	00:13:35	00:13:43	Winning the Golden Pimp as Daddy of the Year, is a honor for DJ Slickbone, 'cause pimping ain't just about sex and bling.
229	00:13:44	00:13:49	It's about standing up to The Man and shaking off that slave mentality.
230	00:13:49	00:13:50	Touch.
231	00:13:52	00:13:53	Nah, baby, baby, listen.
232	00:13:53	00:13:56	See, I'm what you call... (clears throat)
233	00:13:56	00:13:58	a life improvement coach.
234	00:13:59	00:14:01	It ain't all about business with me.
235	00:14:01	00:14:03	I love my wifeys.
236	00:14:03	00:14:06	Back in my dancing days, pimps would come into the club to recruit.
237	00:14:07	00:14:10	They just have a gift for sniffing out the damaged and needy.
238	00:14:10	00:14:13	love.
239	00:14:13	00:14:18	And I'm getting a vibe from you that you haven't always got enough, especially from your father.
240	00:14:18	00:14:19	Am I right?
241	00:14:19	00:14:20	Mm-hmm.
242	00:14:30	00:14:33	Americans are so puritanical.
243	00:14:33	00:14:35	You need to open your mind.
244	00:14:35	00:14:41	This is a Dionysian festival, a celebration of life that stretches back thousands of years.
245	00:14:41	00:14:43	The ancient Greeks greeted the spring...
246	00:14:46	00:14:53	Well, we talked to a few of the girls with the heart and diamond tattoos, but nobody knows nothin' about pimps or hos in this place.
247	00:14:53	00:14:56	Well, we could just haul the whole lot of them in for questioning.
248	00:14:57	00:14:58	No, that won't work.
249	00:14:59	00:15:02	These girls are used to being rousted, plus we have no leverage.
250	00:15:02	00:15:04	I don't know-- maybe we do.
251	00:15:04	00:15:05	I've got an idea.
252	00:15:05	00:15:07	That's one of our tattoo ladies.
253	00:15:07	00:15:10	Let's go talk to that girl onstage, Jim.
254	00:15:18	00:15:20	Las Vegas Police, ma'am.
255	00:15:20	00:15:24	We have reason to believe that you are holding a controlled substance.
256	00:15:24	00:15:25	Oh, no, not me, sir. (chuckles)
257	00:15:25	00:15:27	You know what I love about science?
258	00:15:28	00:15:29	It doesn't lie.
259	00:15:29	00:15:31	Hey, I earned that.
260	00:15:31	00:15:36	I don't mind paying a ho-tax on a straight-up bust, but this is bogus.
261	00:15:37	00:15:40	Look at that-- positive for cocaine.
262	00:15:40	00:15:42	I guess this means you're under arrest.
263	00:15:42	00:15:45	Come with us.
264	00:15:52	00:15:53	Hello, Mrs. Briggs.
265	00:15:53	00:15:57	Why didn't you let me know that Madeline had been photographed in one of your casinos?
266	00:15:57	00:15:58	Mrs. Briggs, what are you doing here?
267	00:15:58	00:16:01	You said you would let me know if there were any developments.
268	00:16:01	00:16:04	Do... Do you think I'm just sitting at home waiting by the phone?
269	00:16:04	00:16:08	I have been on every law enforcement Web site and Listserv across the country.
270	00:16:08	00:16:10	I know how to network.
271	00:16:10	00:16:11	I understand, and I apologize.
272	00:16:11	00:16:12	I should have let you know.
273	00:16:13	00:16:18	We have some evidence that Madeline was in Las Vegas.
274	00:16:18	00:16:20	It was about a week ago.
275	00:16:20	00:16:22	It may no longer be the case, you understand?
276	00:16:22	00:16:25	This is not something that you can pin your hopes to.
277	00:16:25	00:16:30	Okay, just don't decide what information I am capable of handling, all right?
278	00:16:38	00:16:40	She's...
279	00:16:41	00:16:42	She's with a cop.
280	00:16:42	00:16:43	They would have let her call me.
281	00:16:43	00:16:46	Why didn't she call me?
282	00:16:46	00:16:47	I would have come.
283	00:16:47	00:16:48	I would have...
284	00:16:48	00:16:50	brought her back home.
285	00:16:53	00:16:56	Oh, God, I don't care what she's done.
286	00:16:56	00:16:59	I just want to bring my Maddy home.
287	00:17:01	00:17:04	This was recorded at the Clark County Detention Center about an hour ago.
288	00:17:04	00:17:06	Go ahead and play it.
289	00:17:06	00:17:08	I'm so, so sorry to bug you, Daddy.
290	00:17:08	00:17:10	It's just, I'm really scared.
291	00:17:10	00:17:13	Bitch, I told you never to call me from in there.
292	00:17:13	00:17:14	They hear everything we say.
293	00:17:14	00:17:17	They said that my money tested positive for coke.
294	00:17:17	00:17:19	They said that that means hard time.
295	00:17:19	00:17:21	Every bill in America has cocaine on it.
296	00:17:21	00:17:22	Stupid bitch!
297	00:17:24	00:17:26	So, did you trace the call? (cell phone beeping)
298	00:17:26	00:17:28	It went to a disposable cell. There was no address.
299	00:17:28	00:17:32	Someone just came in here to post Diane Jasper's bail.
300	00:17:32	00:17:35	Oh. Daddy sent someone to bring wifey home.
301	00:17:35	00:17:37	Must really love her.
302	00:18:20	00:18:23	The woman who posted bail is Susan Samuels.
303	00:18:23	00:18:25	Career prostitute.
304	00:18:25	00:18:31	Busts for narcotics and solicitation spanning over three decades, but nothing recent.
305	00:18:31	00:18:33	The house belongs to her.
306	00:18:33	00:18:36	She has a son, Anthony, 28.
307	00:18:36	00:18:38	No criminal record.
308	00:18:38	00:18:43	And, apart from a brief stint in the food service industry, no employment history, either.
309	00:18:43	00:18:48	Best guess is mom retired and left Anthony the family business.
310	00:18:49	00:18:51	We need to get into that house.
311	00:18:51	00:18:52	I know.
312	00:18:52	00:18:55	Any judges owe you favors, Jim?
313	00:18:55	00:18:56	Everybody owes me a favor.
314	00:18:56	00:19:02	But we gotta sit on this place until we can get enough probable cause for a warrant.
315	00:19:02	00:19:04	I think I've got something.
316	00:19:08	00:19:10	He's wearing Madeline Briggs' earring.
317	00:19:14	00:19:15	You! Get up! Stand up!
318	00:19:15	00:19:17	Las Vegas Police!
319	00:19:17	00:19:19	Remain calm. We have a warrant to search the premises.
320	00:19:19	00:19:20	Put the bottle down.
321	00:19:20	00:19:23	All right,yo, yo, yo, yo. Let me see your hands! Get 'em up!
322	00:19:23	00:19:24	Everybody be cool, okay?
323	00:19:24	00:19:26	This is my mom's house.
324	00:19:26	00:19:28	Clear!
325	00:19:28	00:19:30	You gonna let me put my shirt on? No.
326	00:19:31	00:19:32	No? That's what's up?
327	00:19:32	00:19:34	Put your hands up.
328	00:19:51	00:19:53	We need the paramedics in here.
329	00:19:53	00:19:56	We have an injured woman on the first floor.
330	00:19:58	00:20:00	Can you say your name?
331	00:20:00	00:20:02	Diane.
332	00:20:05	00:20:08	We're looking for this woman.
333	00:20:08	00:20:11	Her name is Madeline Briggs.
334	00:20:11	00:20:17	Now, if any of you have seen her, we want to know.
335	00:20:17	00:20:19	It might make things easier on you.
336	00:20:19	00:20:20	That's right, ladies.
337	00:20:20	00:20:22	You help out the cops in any way you can.
338	00:20:22	00:20:24	Get back in line!
339	00:22:19	00:22:22	You know, you and I have a lot more in common than you may think.
340	00:22:22	00:22:24	Both of us are in the family business, right?
341	00:22:24	00:22:29	I mean, look at me, my uncle was a cop, my older brother became a cop and then me.
342	00:22:29	00:22:33	If I were in your family, I'd be a sorry-ass sleazeball pimp, like you.
343	00:22:33	00:22:34	I'm not a pimp.
344	00:22:34	00:22:36	Oh, come on, playa, you live with a bunch of prostitutes.
345	00:22:36	00:22:40	Hey, playa, that's just who I am.
346	00:22:40	00:22:41	I like bangin' strippers and whores.
347	00:22:41	00:22:42	You like to beat them up, too, right?
348	00:22:43	00:22:44	Like Diane Jasper.
349	00:22:44	00:22:47	I had nothing to do with that. Oh, come on...
350	00:22:47	00:22:48	Them other bitches did it, man, they crazy.
351	00:22:49	00:22:50	They always doing crap like that.
352	00:22:50	00:22:52	Your fingerprints are all over the baseball bat.
353	00:22:53	00:22:56	We got a lot of goodies on you, man.
354	00:22:56	00:22:57	You know what we found in your barbecue?
355	00:22:57	00:23:00	67 G's in cash!
356	00:23:00	00:23:02	You got 13 G's in chips in there.
357	00:23:02	00:23:04	I mean, there goes the defense fund.
358	00:23:04	00:23:08	We also found Dede Chase's driver's license.
359	00:23:08	00:23:10	How did that get in there?
360	00:23:10	00:23:12	Dede partied with my girls for a couple days. Oh, yeah.
361	00:23:12	00:23:17	Asked me to hold on to her valuables while she went clubbing. Did she also ask you to beat her, rape her and slit her throat?
362	00:23:17	00:23:19	Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa. Huh?
363	00:23:19	00:23:22	I was at Tall-K's PlayerCon the night she got killed, a'ight?
364	00:23:22	00:23:24	A lot of people saw me.
365	00:23:24	00:23:28	They saw you wearing an earring that belonged to Madeline Briggs.
366	00:23:28	00:23:30	She one of your girls?
367	00:23:30	00:23:31	Nah...
368	00:23:31	00:23:33	I, uh...
369	00:23:33	00:23:35	I think Mom brought her by.
370	00:23:35	00:23:36	You know, Mom's always bringing in strays.
371	00:23:37	00:23:39	They crash for a couple days and then they move on.
372	00:23:39	00:23:41	They give me stuff.
373	00:23:41	00:23:42	Do you know where she is?
374	00:23:46	00:23:47	Okay, let me tell you something.
375	00:23:47	00:23:52	If that is her blood in your place, you're in such deep trouble.
376	00:23:52	00:23:55	Give me a lawyer.
377	00:23:55	00:23:58	Diane...
378	00:23:58	00:24:00	Diane, we need your help.
379	00:24:00	00:24:02	No.
380	00:24:02	00:24:04	Don't want more trouble.
381	00:24:04	00:24:08	We want to put Anthony Samuels away so he can't hurt you or anybody else ever again.
382	00:24:08	00:24:11	My fault.
383	00:24:11	00:24:12	I shouldn't have called from jail.
384	00:24:12	00:24:15	Now, I have to earn back my hair.
385	00:24:16	00:24:18	How am I gonna earn like this?
386	00:24:18	00:24:21	Diane, you don't have to.
387	00:24:21	00:24:23	We're gonna help you get out of the game.
388	00:24:23	00:24:25	You can go back to school.
389	00:24:25	00:24:26	You can get a straight job.
390	00:24:26	00:24:29	Will you help Anthony, too?
391	00:24:30	00:24:32	Diane.
392	00:24:32	00:24:34	Anthony's a sociopath.
393	00:24:34	00:24:36	We believe that he murdered Dede Chase.
394	00:24:37	00:24:38	He'd never do anything like that.
395	00:24:38	00:24:39	You don't know him.
396	00:24:39	00:24:41	Diane, he almost killed you.
397	00:24:41	00:24:45	Anthony risked his life for me.
398	00:24:45	00:24:49	That Russian could've put him in a hole in the desert.
399	00:24:49	00:24:54	That Russian has a lot of holes for people who cross him, but Anthony didn't care.
400	00:24:54	00:24:56	He fought for me!
401	00:24:56	00:24:57	Okay, who's the Russian?
402	00:24:59	00:25:02	Before you joined Anthony's family, did you work for somebody else?
403	00:25:03	00:25:05	No, I was solo.
404	00:25:05	00:25:07	I was a renegade.
405	00:25:07	00:25:09	Please go.
406	00:25:13	00:25:15	Let me see your tattoo. Don't touch me!
407	00:25:15	00:25:17	Nurse, nurse! Don't touch me! Get away!
408	00:25:17	00:25:19	Nurse!
409	00:25:19	00:25:21	Get away from me!
410	00:25:21	00:25:24	Get away from me!
411	00:25:24	00:25:26	I don't want you in here!
412	00:25:26	00:25:28	Get out of here!
413	00:25:28	00:25:30	Get out of here.
414	00:25:33	00:25:36	You're messing everything up.
415	00:25:39	00:25:41	Anthony...
416	00:25:41	00:25:44	He loves me.
417	00:25:53	00:25:54	Thanks.
418	00:25:55	00:25:57	Nick.
419	00:25:57	00:25:59	Help me roll her over.
420	00:26:05	00:26:10	This tattoo, it's larger than the ones on Anthony's other girls.
421	00:26:10	00:26:11	Yeah, what's that tell you?
422	00:26:11	00:26:18	Usually, when a girl leaves her pimp, the new daddy gets rid of the old one's brand.
423	00:26:18	00:26:23	Either with, I don't know, a hot iron or battery acid or a cheese grater.
424	00:26:23	00:26:26	There's no evidence of anything like that here.
425	00:26:26	00:26:27	That's right.
426	00:26:27	00:26:30	Which makes me believe that Anthony just covered it up.
427	00:26:30	00:26:36	Since tattoo inks vary among artists, they should fluoresce differently under different wavelengths of light.
428	00:26:48	00:26:50	You know...
429	00:26:50	00:26:53	pimps treat these girls like livestock.
430	00:26:53	00:27:01	Back in the Old West, if another rancher stole another man's cattle and tried to rebrand them, it'd start a range war.
431	00:27:04	00:27:08	The samples that you took from these satellite stains came from one contributor.
432	00:27:08	00:27:10	Madeline Briggs.
433	00:27:10	00:27:12	Yeah, it's exactly what you thought.
434	00:27:12	00:27:21	But then this large stain right here, it was actually from two contributors, so, I subtracted out Madeline's profile from the mix, and I got this.
435	00:27:21	00:27:23	13 alleles in common.
436	00:27:23	00:27:25	That's a parent-child relationship.
437	00:27:25	00:27:28	CSI New York discovered that Madeline was pregnant.
438	00:27:28	00:27:30	That blood is from a miscarriage?
439	00:27:30	00:27:34	Anthony Samuels buys Madeline from the Miami-New York traffickers.
440	00:27:35	00:27:40	According to Vice, the going price is ten grand.
441	00:27:41	00:27:42	That's a serious investment.
442	00:27:42	00:27:44	Then he discovers she's pregnant.
443	00:27:44	00:27:48	He realizes she's not going to make him a lot of money in that condition.
444	00:27:48	00:27:50	So he feels ripped off.
445	00:27:50	00:27:51	And then he takes it out on her.
446	00:27:59	00:28:00	Do you think she could've survived?
447	00:28:00	00:28:05	The bloodstain on the mattress is consistent with about a pint of blood.
448	00:28:05	00:28:08	The covers were replaced.
449	00:28:08	00:28:11	There's no way to know how much blood was really there.
450	00:28:11	00:28:12	There's just no way to tell.
451	00:28:12	00:28:19	So, we matched the butterfly tattoo to about a dozen prostitutes in town, all of whom receive regular visits from that guy.
452	00:28:20	00:28:21	Dimitri Sadesky.
453	00:28:21	00:28:25	Diane's scary Russian. And Vice thinks he's taking a piece of their action.
454	00:28:25	00:28:26	You know where to find him?
455	00:28:26	00:28:27	Yeah, but you won't believe it.
456	00:28:27	00:28:36	Do we not all harbor covert passions that society tells us is inappropriate?
457	00:28:36	00:28:38	See?
458	00:28:38	00:28:40	Shana knows what I'm talking about.
459	00:28:40	00:28:50	It's facile to dismiss a middle-aged literature professor as a deviant for deflowering...
460	00:28:50	00:28:52	a 12-year-old nymphette.
461	00:28:52	00:28:54	I mean, is he really so different from the rest of us?
462	00:28:54	00:28:58	Are you sure you want to learn about Nabokov from a pimp, miss?
463	00:28:58	00:29:02	More unsupported accusations from LVPD Vice.
464	00:29:02	00:29:03	It sounds like a bad TV show, huh?
465	00:29:03	00:29:05	Oh, I don't know anything about that.
466	00:29:05	00:29:06	I'm a Homicide detective.
467	00:29:06	00:29:08	Okay, everybody.
468	00:29:08	00:29:10	Class dismissed.
469	00:29:11	00:29:14	Thank you.
470	00:29:16	00:29:19	So, Professor, you recognize these girls?
471	00:29:20	00:29:24	Diane Jasper, used to wear your brand until she was rustled by Anthony Samuels.
472	00:29:24	00:29:27	I think you have me confused with someone else.
473	00:29:27	00:29:29	So, how's it work in the pimp world, huh?
474	00:29:29	00:29:33	To discourage poaching, if he takes one of your girls, you take one of his?
475	00:29:33	00:29:39	I'm sure I don't know, but I wonder, what has become of loyalty, hmm?
476	00:29:40	00:29:48	An organization invests time and money training an employee, and the moment they get the better offer, they bolt.
477	00:29:48	00:29:54	How are we ever going to dig our way out of this recession with work ethic like this, huh?
478	00:29:54	00:29:57	That's very poetic, but it's not an answer.
479	00:29:59	00:30:01	Hey...
480	00:30:01	00:30:02	This is my car.
481	00:30:02	00:30:05	What are you doing with my car?
482	00:30:05	00:30:06	This is my car!
483	00:30:06	00:30:07	Hey!
484	00:30:10	00:30:11	Hey!
485	00:30:11	00:30:14	I want to see your warrant.
486	00:30:14	00:30:17	This vehicle is parked in plain view in a public area, sir.
487	00:30:18	00:30:19	We don't need a warrant.
488	00:30:19	00:30:22	Well... that's a nice car, Dimitri.
489	00:30:22	00:30:26	You know, Vice told me that five years ago, you were handing out flyers outside a strip club.
490	00:30:26	00:30:32	Now here you are living like a king up in 10,000 square feet in Sunrise Mountain.
491	00:30:32	00:30:36	That's pretty good for an old Soviet lit professor who came to this country with his hat in his hand.
492	00:30:36	00:30:37	Wouldn't you say, Ray?
493	00:30:37	00:30:39	I embraced the entrepreneurial spirit that is the American Dream.
494	00:30:39	00:30:41	Perhaps you've heard of this.
495	00:30:41	00:30:43	You been doing any off-roading in the desert lately, Mr. Sadesky?
496	00:30:44	00:30:46	Sometimes I drive up there to-to collect butterflies.
497	00:30:46	00:30:49	Yeah, and put young girls into holes in the ground.
498	00:30:49	00:30:50	What are you doing?
499	00:30:50	00:30:51	What is this?
500	00:30:51	00:30:52	This?
501	00:30:53	00:30:54	Geiger counter.
502	00:30:54	00:30:57	You know, like the one used at Chernobyl.
503	00:30:57	00:30:59	Perhaps you've heard of this.
504	00:31:03	00:31:04	Let me share something with you.
505	00:31:04	00:31:07	Something I have learned about women.
506	00:31:07	00:31:10	Inside, they're all whores.
507	00:31:11	00:31:15	They all love to hear the things that they want to believe.
508	00:31:15	00:31:17	That they are so beautiful, so fascinating.
509	00:31:17	00:31:24	So special that they deserve the best of everything-- the finest clothes, champagne, and jewels-- that money can buy.
510	00:31:25	00:31:29	And you know how you get the whore to emerge, huh?
511	00:31:29	00:31:39	(counter clicking) You tell her there's an easy way to get all of this, and watch her lick her lips and ask you how.
512	00:31:39	00:31:47	These levels are consistent with residue on a dismembered leg we found in Miami, with your butterfly tattoo on it.
513	00:31:47	00:31:50	We're going to impound your vehicle, Mr. Sadesky.
514	00:31:50	00:31:52	Don't worry.
515	00:31:52	00:31:53	We'll give you a ride.
516	00:32:01	00:32:03	Nick. Yeah?
517	00:32:03	00:32:06	We're holding Dimitri, but he's already lawyered up.
518	00:32:06	00:32:09	Okay, so we gotta find something that connects him to Dede Chase.
519	00:32:09	00:32:11	Or Madeline Briggs.
520	00:32:11	00:32:12	Or both.
521	00:32:13	00:32:14	All right.
522	00:33:53	00:33:56	We found the purse in Anthony's house along with your clothes.
523	00:33:56	00:34:01	You had it at the Tangiers the night that Dede Chase was killed.
524	00:34:01	00:34:04	And security footage...
525	00:34:04	00:34:06	confirms that you were following her.
526	00:34:06	00:34:10	If the DNA on that blood comes back Dede's, you're all wrapped up in murder one.
527	00:34:10	00:34:16	So, if Anthony Samuels forced you to participate in this murder in any way, now is the time to tell us, okay?
528	00:34:17	00:34:19	Knew I should've dumped that purse.
529	00:34:22	00:34:24	I just couldn't.
530	00:34:24	00:34:27	It was the first thing that Anthony gave me when we were dating.
531	00:34:27	00:34:29	Dating?
532	00:34:30	00:34:32	Yeah, he courted me.
533	00:34:32	00:34:34	When I was working for Dimitri.
534	00:34:34	00:34:36	Said that he loved me.
535	00:34:36	00:34:40	He'd write me these little poems.
536	00:34:40	00:34:42	Said he was going to marry me.
537	00:34:42	00:34:43	So, that's why you left Dimitri?
538	00:34:45	00:34:49	He said that the other wifeys would be working for us.
539	00:34:49	00:34:56	And he was saving up so me and him could retire in Hawaii and raise a family.
540	00:34:56	00:34:58	That all changed the night we picked up Dede.
541	00:34:58	00:35:03	Anthony needed another wifey to up the cash flow.
542	00:35:03	00:35:04	Hey, honey.
543	00:35:04	00:35:06	You look lost.
544	00:35:06	00:35:08	Do you want a ride?
545	00:35:10	00:35:11	It's okay.
546	00:35:11	00:35:13	Okay.
547	00:35:14	00:35:16	Thanks.
548	00:35:16	00:35:18	I'm staying at the Four Kings.
549	00:35:18	00:35:20	I really appreciate this.
550	00:35:21	00:35:24	Took a couple of days, but he wore her down.
551	00:35:26	00:35:29	Take it like a ho.
552	00:35:34	00:35:36	You are one...
553	00:35:36	00:35:39	dynamite piece of ass.
554	00:35:39	00:35:42	Matter of fact, I'm about to make you my bottom bitch.
555	00:35:42	00:35:48	These other wifeys, they're gonna work for us.
556	00:35:48	00:35:51	A couple years, we'll retire to Hawaii.
557	00:35:51	00:35:53	You're gonna love it.
558	00:35:53	00:35:55	Sounds great to me, Daddy.
559	00:35:57	00:35:59	He thought he broke her.
560	00:35:59	00:36:01	That girl was cagey. She pretended to dig it.
561	00:36:01	00:36:02	And Anthony...
562	00:36:02	00:36:04	Anthony fell for it.
563	00:36:04	00:36:06	Tell me what happened at the Tangiers.
564	00:36:07	00:36:10	That was the first night that she was to earn?
565	00:36:10	00:36:12	Wasn't it? And you were there to turn her out?
566	00:36:13	00:36:14	Yeah.
567	00:36:15	00:36:19	And when her trick came down alone five minutes after they went up, I knew she was gonna bolt.
568	00:36:23	00:36:25	Where do you think you're going? Where do you think?
569	00:36:25	00:36:27	You can't leave Anthony. Come with me.
570	00:36:27	00:36:30	I... I-I can't.
571	00:36:30	00:36:31	You want to be with him?
572	00:36:31	00:36:33	Are you insane?
573	00:36:33	00:36:35	What the hell are you thinking?
574	00:36:41	00:36:44	Anthony told me he loved me.
575	00:36:48	00:36:52	Nobody had ever said that to me before.
576	00:37:01	00:37:05	It seems an odd place to look for butterflies.
577	00:37:05	00:37:07	But a great place to hide a body.
578	00:37:11	00:37:16	We have DNA from the blood we found in the Russian's SUV.
579	00:37:16	00:37:18	It is Madeline's.
580	00:38:18	00:38:25	We found four mummified female DB's at a location that was in the GPS memory of your vehicle.
581	00:38:25	00:38:28	The palm on one of the bodies had a cigarette burn.
582	00:38:29	00:38:31	Wasn't enough for you to kill them.
583	00:38:31	00:38:32	You had to torture them, too, right?
584	00:38:32	00:38:35	But the desert preserves DNA, Dimitri.
585	00:38:37	00:38:41	My client has information the D.A. and the FBI would be very interested in.
586	00:38:41	00:38:43	And he's willing to cooperate.
587	00:38:43	00:38:48	Well, if he wants to avoid the death penalty, then your client better do that.
588	00:38:48	00:38:53	You can start by telling me what you did with Madeline Briggs, Dimitri.
589	00:38:53	00:38:55	These bodies we found have been in the ground a long time.
590	00:38:55	00:38:57	Too long to be Madeline.
591	00:38:57	00:38:59	The girl meant something to you, huh?
592	00:38:59	00:39:01	Dimitri...
593	00:39:02	00:39:04	I can see that.
594	00:39:04	00:39:06	Fine.
595	00:39:06	00:39:11	As a token of my good faith, I'll tell you what I did with her.
596	00:39:11	00:39:13	I'm listening.
597	00:39:13	00:39:15	Nothing.
598	00:39:15	00:39:17	Her blood was in your car.
599	00:39:17	00:39:18	How do you explain that?
600	00:39:18	00:39:24	She was a peace offering from Anthony, in exchange for stealing Diane from me.
601	00:39:24	00:39:26	I accepted this.
602	00:39:26	00:39:29	But... only to save face.
603	00:39:29	00:39:34	I could see he had destroyed her commercial value.
604	00:39:34	00:39:40	She knew nothing of me or my operation, so, easiest thing to do...
605	00:39:40	00:39:43	was let her go.
606	00:39:51	00:39:55	So... I'm not such a hard-hearted guy, huh?
607	00:40:04	00:40:05	Well, well, well.
608	00:40:06	00:40:08	It's not Christmas yet.
609	00:40:08	00:40:10	Aren't we lucky?
610	00:40:10	00:40:12	What is this stuff?
611	00:40:12	00:40:16	Uh, Langston sent us some souvenirs from Miami and New York. Oh.
612	00:40:16	00:40:17	Oh.
613	00:40:17	00:40:20	I was kind of hoping for a little somethin'-somethin' from Bergdorf's.
614	00:40:22	00:40:24	I love this.
615	00:40:24	00:40:26	How do I look?
616	00:40:26	00:40:28	Bitchin'. Oh... ridiculous.
617	00:40:30	00:40:34	The names Dimitri gave us are going to help Miami and New York roll up most of the human trafficking syndicate.
618	00:40:34	00:40:36	Oh, so we did some good.
619	00:40:37	00:40:38	Not good enough.
620	00:40:39	00:40:42	Look, if Dimitri really set her free, then why didn't Madeline go home?
621	00:40:42	00:40:50	Well, a lot of girls that try to get out of that life come out feeling so degraded and ashamed, they feel like, sometimes, nobody will ever want them again.
622	00:40:50	00:40:52	You know what I mean?
623	00:40:54	00:40:56	Yeah.
624	00:41:30	00:41:31	What are you doing? Using the ho-vine.
625	00:41:32	00:41:37	The phones we recovered in Anthony's house all had the same numbers programmed into them.
626	00:41:37	00:41:39	He must've given one of them to each of his girls.
627	00:41:40	00:41:41	You think Madeline still has hers.
628	00:41:42	00:41:45	It's good to hope for things, right?
629	00:42:51	00:42:53	Madeline.
630	00:42:53	00:42:55	You're Langston?
631	00:42:55	00:42:58	Yes.
632	00:42:58	00:43:02	How can I go back after everything that's happened?
633	00:43:02	00:43:05	(sniffling) All you have to do is...
634	00:43:05	00:43:07	walk through the door.
635	00:43:14	00:43:16	Come on.
636	00:43:20	00:43:21	It's all right.
