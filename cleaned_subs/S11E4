1,00:00:22,00:00:24,"(click, scratching)"
2,00:00:35,00:00:38,(stairs squeaking quietly)
3,00:01:13,00:01:14,(blade rings)
4,00:01:42,00:01:44,(screaming)
5,00:01:44,00:01:46,(sobbing) No...
6,00:01:46,00:01:49,(screams) Please!
7,00:01:49,00:01:52,Stop! No!
8,00:01:52,00:01:54,"(sirens wail, whoop)"
9,00:02:00,00:02:03,"Hey, Nick. Guys."
10,00:02:03,00:02:04,Don't worry. She's going to make it.
11,00:02:04,00:02:05,"Hey, I saw you on TV last week, Ryan."
12,00:02:05,00:02:08,You're a real hero. What can I say?
13,00:02:08,00:02:09,It's not all it's cracked up to be.
14,00:02:09,00:02:12,He saved a bunch of kids out of a burning building last week.
15,00:02:12,00:02:14,"LANGSTON: Hey, isn't that Margot Wilton."
16,00:02:14,00:02:16,SANDERS: First Lady of Vegas.
17,00:02:16,00:02:17,She's Miss Philanthropy herself.
18,00:02:17,00:02:20,She's got more buildings named after her than you can count.
19,00:02:20,00:02:21,It's a real slash job.
20,00:02:21,00:02:23,Bedroom's a horror show.
21,00:02:23,00:02:24,Upstairs on your left.
22,00:02:24,00:02:26,It's a real shame.
23,00:02:36,00:02:37,Ray and I will take the bedroom. Nick...
24,00:02:37,00:02:40,I'll find out how he got in.
25,00:02:40,00:02:42,Guess I'm on the perimeter.
26,00:03:35,00:03:38,Fresh carvings.
27,00:03:38,00:03:41,Must be what's left of the boy's face.
28,00:03:42,00:03:48,"So the intruder had to take the photographs out of the frames, obliterate the faces and then reassemble them."
29,00:03:48,00:03:50,"WILLOWS: Not once, but twice."
30,00:03:50,00:03:52,He certainly wasn't in any rush.
31,00:03:53,00:03:56,Key to the City.
32,00:03:57,00:03:59,Upside down.
33,00:04:07,00:04:10,Dust.
34,00:04:10,00:04:11,Someone just did this.
35,00:04:13,00:04:15,Clean as a whistle.
36,00:04:15,00:04:19,Two carved-out faces...
37,00:04:19,00:04:21,and an upside-down award.
38,00:04:21,00:04:24,It's up to us to make it right side up.
39,00:05:10,00:05:12,(door creaks)
40,00:05:47,00:05:54,"Blood on the bed, the headboard, wall."
41,00:05:54,00:05:56,This is obviously where she called for help.
42,00:05:56,00:05:58,"The ""9"" and the ""1"" are covered in blood."
43,00:06:01,00:06:06,The castoff on the wall suggests her attacker was directly over her.
44,00:06:06,00:06:08,(screaming)
45,00:06:11,00:06:13,Two voids.
46,00:06:14,00:06:18,Consistent with someone kneeling over her...
47,00:06:18,00:06:20,on top of her.
48,00:06:20,00:06:23,There was no visible blood on the stairs we just came up or the hallway we just came out of.
49,00:06:23,00:06:26,There has to be a trail somewhere.
50,00:06:28,00:06:31,Here we go.
51,00:06:31,00:06:34,"LANGSTON: Footprint, handprint, followed by handprint, footprint."
52,00:06:34,00:06:36,That's odd.
53,00:06:36,00:06:41,Fading as they go out these doors here.
54,00:06:41,00:06:45,So this guy gets off the bed one hand and one foot at time.
55,00:06:45,00:06:46,That's weird.
56,00:07:17,00:07:19,STOKES: Hey.
57,00:07:20,00:07:22,I found the point of entry.
58,00:07:22,00:07:24,"No, no, you're a little late, buddy, I already found it."
59,00:07:24,00:07:25,Entry and exit.
60,00:07:25,00:07:29,Looks like he cut a circular hole in the glass of the French door.
61,00:07:29,00:07:31,Guess he put it back in on his way out.
62,00:07:31,00:07:33,I don't know why he'd do that.
63,00:07:33,00:07:36,Unless he's trying to make us think that he's never been in the house before.
64,00:07:36,00:07:41,"All the other windows I checked have been varnished shut, except this one."
65,00:07:41,00:07:45,"See, the varnish seal has been cut."
66,00:07:45,00:07:54,And I got fresh chips and what appears to be a dust void on the sill with a feathering pattern on either side of the void.
67,00:07:54,00:07:58,All indicative of entry and exit.
68,00:07:58,00:08:01,"Somebody has been through this window, multiple times."
69,00:08:01,00:08:03,"What is that, 12 by 12?"
70,00:08:03,00:08:04,That's pretty tight.
71,00:08:04,00:08:06,I know neither one of us are getting through there.
72,00:08:06,00:08:11,"Well, then, it could be we're looking for a small guy, or even a kid."
73,00:08:11,00:08:13,"Yeah, or a leprechaun."
74,00:08:13,00:08:15,Or a leprechaun.
75,00:08:15,00:08:21,"Big ups to Greg-- he found a second entry point, but now I've got more questions than answers."
76,00:08:21,00:08:22,How about you?
77,00:08:22,00:08:30,"Here's one: Woman in her 60s, vulnerable in her bed, versus a blade- wielding intruder."
78,00:08:30,00:08:35,Is she lucky to be alive or did she survive by design?
79,00:08:35,00:08:41,"All right, now, based on the messages he left, it's obvious that he didn't approve of her Key to the City."
80,00:08:41,00:08:44,And the child in the wheelchair obviously didn't sit well with him.
81,00:08:44,00:08:47,"This all makes me think it was personal, Nick."
82,00:08:47,00:08:51,He's been in and out of her house multiple times.
83,00:08:51,00:08:52,He could have killed her whenever he wanted to.
84,00:08:52,00:08:54,Why tonight?
85,00:08:54,00:08:56,I think the answer is in these messages he left.
86,00:08:56,00:09:00,"I mean, it can't be in the fingerprints, because he didn't leave any."
87,00:09:00,00:09:03,Does any of this make sense to you?
88,00:09:03,00:09:05,"No, but I bet it makes a lot of sense to him."
89,00:09:05,00:09:09,We need to examine the one piece of evidence the killer shouldn't have left behind.
90,00:09:09,00:09:11,Margot Wilton.
91,00:09:12,00:09:14,MARGOT: It was very dark.
92,00:09:14,00:09:18,I think... that he was African-American.
93,00:09:20,00:09:24,"Strange, uh, slippery."
94,00:09:24,00:09:26,"Slippery how, was he sweating?"
95,00:09:26,00:09:28,"No. Uh, more like..."
96,00:09:28,00:09:30,he was wearing gloves.
97,00:09:33,00:09:40,The one thing that I can't get out of my head-- those eyes.
98,00:09:40,00:09:43,Black holes.
99,00:09:43,00:09:45,Teeth.
100,00:09:45,00:09:46,Teeth?
101,00:09:46,00:09:47,Braces.
102,00:09:47,00:09:49,Braces? I don't know.
103,00:09:49,00:09:51,"I'm not sure. All right, all right, all right."
104,00:09:51,00:09:53,Did he say anything to you?
105,00:09:54,00:09:56,No...
106,00:09:56,00:09:58,I only heard my own screams.
107,00:09:58,00:09:59,Well...
108,00:09:59,00:10:06,"You are a very brave woman, and now I understand why you received the Key to the City."
109,00:10:08,00:10:16,"I, um, noticed in your home there were several pictures of yourself and a young boy in a wheelchair."
110,00:10:16,00:10:17,Is that your son?
111,00:10:17,00:10:18,Robbie.
112,00:10:18,00:10:20,From my first marriage.
113,00:10:20,00:10:21,Uh-huh.
114,00:10:21,00:10:23,He died very young.
115,00:10:23,00:10:24,He was so sick.
116,00:10:24,00:10:25,I'm so sorry.
117,00:10:25,00:10:28,"Looks like his spirit lived on, though."
118,00:10:28,00:10:31,"Um, I read the plaque. What did it say?"
119,00:10:31,00:10:35,"Uh, fortitude, fulfillment and philanthropy, was it?"
120,00:10:35,00:10:36,I did it for him.
121,00:10:36,00:10:39,All I ever wanted to was help people.
122,00:10:39,00:10:45,"And 50 years later, Mayor Goodman gave me the Key to the City."
123,00:10:45,00:10:47,I'm sorry. Your cuts are evidence.
124,00:10:47,00:10:51,Don't you doctors and police ever talk to one another?
125,00:10:51,00:10:57,Wouldn't it have been a lot easier if that cute young resident hadn't stitched me up at all?
126,00:10:57,00:10:59,"Well, he was just doing his job, and I'm doing mine."
127,00:10:59,00:11:01,"What's the matter, I'm not cute?"
128,00:11:01,00:11:03,Not right now.
129,00:11:03,00:11:05,"Would you put your finger right here, please."
130,00:11:05,00:11:07,(groans)
131,00:11:08,00:11:09,Say I'm cute.
132,00:11:09,00:11:12,Go to hell.
133,00:11:18,00:11:20,You look like you just fell down a chimney.
134,00:11:20,00:11:21,That's about the only thing I haven't printed.
135,00:11:21,00:11:24,(grunts)
136,00:11:24,00:11:25,I've been at this for hours.
137,00:11:25,00:11:27,I don't have one usable print.
138,00:11:27,00:11:30,"Well, you know what my Papa Olaf used to tell me..."
139,00:11:30,00:11:31,"(sighs) What's that, Greg?"
140,00:11:31,00:11:43,"(Norwegian accent): ""Hojern, when the going gets rough, keep your chin up."" I was walking the perimeter, and I noticed a window above the bedroom window."
141,00:11:43,00:11:45,This place has an attic somewhere.
142,00:11:45,00:11:49,"We know this guy has been coming in and out of here, but that's one place we haven't looked."
143,00:12:01,00:12:03,After you.
144,00:12:03,00:12:04,I don't do attics.
145,00:12:04,00:12:05,I'm dirty enough.
146,00:12:05,00:12:08,After you.
147,00:12:09,00:12:11,Attaboy.
148,00:12:27,00:12:31,"Damn, she's got a lot of awards."
149,00:12:31,00:12:33,"Yeah, she's got a lot of everything."
150,00:12:44,00:12:46,This house is holey.
151,00:12:46,00:12:47,What?
152,00:12:47,00:12:50,Look up.
153,00:12:50,00:12:52,How many pinkies?
154,00:12:52,00:12:55,I know a rat didn't do that.
155,00:13:05,00:13:09,Not unless the rat's kinky and knows how to use a lipstick cam.
156,00:13:11,00:13:13,(sniffing)
157,00:13:32,00:13:38,He's been living up here and keeping one eye on Margot Wilton.
158,00:13:38,00:13:40,Hey.
159,00:13:40,00:13:42,"He's, he's been reading her mail."
160,00:13:42,00:13:44,These envelope lips are rippled.
161,00:13:44,00:13:45,It's pretty obvious they've been steamed open.
162,00:13:45,00:13:49,You and Margot have something in common.
163,00:13:49,00:13:51,"Yeah, what's that?"
164,00:13:51,00:13:52,A stalker.
165,00:13:52,00:13:53,That was a long time ago.
166,00:13:53,00:13:56,(grunts)
167,00:13:56,00:13:58,Nick.
168,00:13:58,00:14:00,Hmm?
169,00:14:00,00:14:02,Help me with this bed.
170,00:14:02,00:14:05,Yeah.
171,00:14:18,00:14:20,Looks like they were sleeping together.
172,00:14:22,00:14:24,But he never touched her until last night.
173,00:14:29,00:14:31,"Margot Wilton's house is a bust-- no fingerprints, no trace, no DNA."
174,00:14:31,00:14:36,"As of right now, the guy we're chasing is forensic-proof."
175,00:14:36,00:14:37,He'd be the first.
176,00:14:37,00:14:42,Which leads us to the Hourglass of Evidence.
177,00:14:42,00:14:52,"Now, normally, we collect evidence, we analyze it, it leads us to the truth, but here we have the absence of individualized evidence, so let's flip..."
178,00:14:52,00:14:54,the hourglass.
179,00:14:56,00:14:57,The absence of evidence is evidence.
180,00:14:57,00:15:00,"And from that, we can draw certain conclusions."
181,00:15:00,00:15:05,So the suspect went in and out of the house through a small window.
182,00:15:05,00:15:09,So he's small. Which is consistent with the dust void under her bed.
183,00:15:09,00:15:10,No more than five-eight.
184,00:15:10,00:15:12,WILLOWS: He's agile.
185,00:15:12,00:15:16,"Virtually spider-walked off of her bed-- foot, hand, hand, foot."
186,00:15:16,00:15:23,"LANGSTON: So we have a possible male, slight build, medium height, physically fit, younger rather than older."
187,00:15:23,00:15:25,And... maniacally patient.
188,00:15:25,00:15:33,"He sat in the attic eating oranges, watching Margot Wilton for possibly weeks, even months."
189,00:15:33,00:15:37,"Lying under her bed, reading her mail, invading her life without her ever knowing it."
190,00:15:37,00:15:38,He's diabolical.
191,00:15:38,00:15:47,"So, by analyzing what's not there, we begin to fill the bottom of the hourglass, which leads us to..."
192,00:15:52,00:15:54,...the truth.
193,00:15:54,00:15:58,Let's reanalyze the evidence with fresh eyes.
194,00:16:09,00:16:12,Looks like urine.
195,00:16:12,00:16:16,But it's not in the appropriate anatomical region.
196,00:16:18,00:16:21,(sniffs)
197,00:16:22,00:16:24,Doesn't smell like urine.
198,00:16:24,00:16:26,"You know, uh, Grissom would have tasted that."
199,00:16:27,00:16:29,Could be sweat.
200,00:16:29,00:16:32,It fluoresces the same as urine.
201,00:16:32,00:16:34,So you're saying only his spine was sweating?
202,00:16:34,00:16:36,Spines don't have sweat glands.
203,00:16:36,00:16:38,"Well, if it is sweat, then we can get epithelials."
204,00:16:38,00:16:41,Hm. Run DNA.
205,00:16:41,00:16:44,No sweat.
206,00:17:29,00:17:32,"Wish I could say I don't have a fetish, but I do."
207,00:17:32,00:17:35,Should I shut the door?
208,00:17:35,00:17:40,Amylase confirmed that the carpet stain was sweat.
209,00:17:40,00:17:45,"DNA was compromised, so it was a dead end there, but the sweat was not alone."
210,00:17:45,00:17:48,"What was with it? Well, here's where the fetish comes in."
211,00:17:48,00:17:57,"Found trace amounts of silicone, cyclopentasiloxane, and other components that are commonly found in latex fetish sprays."
212,00:17:57,00:18:01,Primary use is to slide on skintight latex suits.
213,00:18:01,00:18:02,Hmm.
214,00:18:02,00:18:07,The victim said her attacker was a black male adult who felt slippery.
215,00:18:07,00:18:08,He was probably wearing latex.
216,00:18:08,00:18:11,With a zipper up the back.
217,00:18:11,00:18:14,Which explains why his spine was sweating.
218,00:18:15,00:18:19,(singsongy): Time to get kinky.
219,00:18:21,00:18:23,I knew I should've shut the door.
220,00:18:38,00:18:40,"WILLOWS: Doberman head, nice."
221,00:18:40,00:18:42,That's new.
222,00:18:42,00:18:43,"What do you mean ""that's new""?"
223,00:18:43,00:18:45,"You got to keep up with these things, Nicky."
224,00:18:45,00:18:47,All sex crimes start with fantasies.
225,00:18:47,00:18:51,"When it goes from the big head to the little head, that's where we come in. You follow?"
226,00:18:51,00:18:54,"I mean, you didn't think I came in here recreationally, did you?"
227,00:18:54,00:18:59,"I don't know, you just referred to a dog mask in a sex shop as ""nice"" and ""new."" I had to ask."
228,00:18:59,00:19:00,You okay?
229,00:19:00,00:19:01,Are you?
230,00:19:01,00:19:02,MAN: Catherine!
231,00:19:02,00:19:04,"Hey! Hey, I got your call."
232,00:19:04,00:19:07,Got that multispeed hoo-hah they ordered for you.
233,00:19:07,00:19:09,"It was hot pink, right?"
234,00:19:10,00:19:12,I'm kidding.
235,00:19:12,00:19:15,Joey's been a great resource for all my sex crimes.
236,00:19:15,00:19:16,STOKES: So...
237,00:19:16,00:19:18,latex? Mm!
238,00:19:18,00:19:21,What is our suspect into?
239,00:19:21,00:19:25,"Well, according to our trace tech, it's a silicone-based fetish spray."
240,00:19:25,00:19:28,"To put on latex, preferably skintight latex."
241,00:19:28,00:19:29,It's probably full-body.
242,00:19:29,00:19:32,"Okay, let's talk silicone spray."
243,00:19:32,00:19:34,"You know, I only carry one brand."
244,00:19:34,00:19:35,It's a pretty slow mover.
245,00:19:35,00:19:41,"I did sell a couple bottles, though, about six months ago, to a guy who, uh..."
246,00:19:41,00:19:44,"oh, he custom-ordered two latex head-to-toes."
247,00:19:44,00:19:45,Head-to-toes? Yeah.
248,00:19:45,00:19:47,"It's full head gear, gloves, booties."
249,00:19:47,00:19:50,"Every inch covered except for the eyes, the nose, the mouth."
250,00:19:50,00:19:52,"Well, I know you keep some kind of records."
251,00:19:52,00:19:54,"Oh, come on, I got more than that."
252,00:19:54,00:19:55,"I got concept drawings, I got photos."
253,00:19:55,00:19:57,I made the suits myself.
254,00:19:57,00:20:01,"Took me a couple days, but they turned out just so great."
255,00:20:01,00:20:02,Photos?
256,00:20:02,00:20:05,"I mean, you have a picture of him?"
257,00:20:05,00:20:07,Yep.
258,00:20:10,00:20:13,This explains the sweat stain in the dust void.
259,00:20:13,00:20:15,He was sweating through his zipper.
260,00:20:15,00:20:19,Do you have anything with him without the mask?
261,00:20:19,00:20:20,He wouldn't allow it.
262,00:20:20,00:20:24,That's a pretty tough ask in a place like this. Sure.
263,00:20:24,00:20:25,Heterochromia.
264,00:20:25,00:20:26,"One blue eye, one brown."
265,00:20:26,00:20:27,Hmm.
266,00:20:27,00:20:29,You got anything else on this guy?
267,00:20:29,00:20:30,"I don't know, let me check."
268,00:20:30,00:20:35,"I remember he wouldn't leave an address, he always paid cash, but... look at that."
269,00:20:35,00:20:37,Did leave a name.
270,00:20:38,00:20:40,Ian Moone.
271,00:20:45,00:20:47,(computer beeping)
272,00:20:52,00:20:54,(clicks tongue)
273,00:21:01,00:21:03,(mumbling): Ian Moone.
274,00:21:05,00:21:07,Ian...
275,00:21:09,00:21:12,Moone.
276,00:21:18,00:21:20,One.
277,00:21:33,00:21:54,"""I am no one."" Uh, be sure to lock your doors."
278,00:21:54,00:21:55,Okay.
279,00:21:55,00:21:56,"GIRL: Go, Mommy."
280,00:21:56,00:21:58,Car wash! Yay!
281,00:21:58,00:21:59,"It's on a timer, sweetie."
282,00:21:59,00:22:01,"Sit back and relax, put your earbuds in."
283,00:22:01,00:22:02,Listen to your music.
284,00:22:08,00:22:09,Hey. It's me.
285,00:22:15,00:22:18,I'm at the car wash.
286,00:22:18,00:22:21,"A-And I'm sorry I couldn't get away earlier to talk, but..."
287,00:22:21,00:22:23,Yeah.
288,00:22:23,00:22:25,How's my Mr. Everything?
289,00:22:25,00:22:28,"GIRL: Look, dolly, it's a bubble bath!"
290,00:22:28,00:22:30,Really! (laughs)
291,00:22:30,00:22:31,Okay.
292,00:22:31,00:22:34,You know I will. I always do.
293,00:22:35,00:22:37,I will make it happen.
294,00:22:44,00:22:45,I always do.
295,00:22:45,00:22:48,I need to see you.
296,00:22:48,00:22:50,"No, I need to see all of you."
297,00:22:50,00:22:51,Say good-bye! (screams)
298,00:22:51,00:22:54,(screaming)
299,00:22:54,00:22:55,Help me! Help...!
300,00:22:58,00:23:00,"(screaming, blade slashing)"
301,00:23:03,00:23:04,(screaming stops)
302,00:23:04,00:23:06,(mechanisms whirring)
303,00:23:13,00:23:16,(fingers squeaking)
304,00:23:17,00:23:19,(squeaking)
305,00:23:25,00:23:26,(screams)
306,00:23:29,00:23:33,"What do you think the ""A"" stands for?"
307,00:23:33,00:23:37,Are you sure it was just the mother and daughter in the car?
308,00:23:37,00:23:39,"Yeah, just the two, ma'am."
309,00:23:40,00:23:46,"Well, if they were alone in a locked car, how the hell did this happen, Greg?"
310,00:24:03,00:24:05,Catherine?
311,00:24:05,00:24:07,Got blood back here.
312,00:24:07,00:24:08,Mostly smears.
313,00:24:10,00:24:12,"Well, I've got half of a bloody hand impression."
314,00:24:12,00:24:14,So do I.
315,00:24:17,00:24:24,"Well, it appears that there was no blood on him as he went to kill her, but he definitely left traces of her blood as he was backing out."
316,00:24:28,00:24:30,SANDERS: Blood transfer on the hatch release.
317,00:24:33,00:24:36,Carpet's bone-dry.
318,00:24:36,00:24:40,He had to be in the car before it went through the wash.
319,00:24:43,00:24:45,Spare tire compartment.
320,00:24:45,00:24:47,No tire.
321,00:24:47,00:24:53,Is it possible that the same guy who crawled through the bathroom window fit into a space like this?
322,00:24:58,00:25:00,"Well, if he was here, where did he go?"
323,00:25:00,00:25:04,And how did he get away without being seen?
324,00:25:07,00:25:09,425A! Suspect on the premises!
325,00:25:24,00:25:25,"Greg, flashlight."
326,00:25:40,00:25:42,Damn it! Who turned on the water?
327,00:25:42,00:25:45,MAN (shouting): Shut it down! Shut it down!
328,00:25:47,00:25:58,"Alise... I know you don't want to talk to anybody, and I know you're scared, but I'm a policeman and I'm trying to do my job, so, I thought maybe we'd play a little game."
329,00:25:58,00:26:02,"Maybe... if you let me, I... I'll talk to your doll."
330,00:26:02,00:26:04,Would that be okay?
331,00:26:07,00:26:09,Great. Thank you.
332,00:26:09,00:26:11,"Hello, doll."
333,00:26:11,00:26:13,My name is James.
334,00:26:13,00:26:16,I'm trying to help Alise out of a tough spot.
335,00:26:16,00:26:21,"So can you tell me, was anyone else in the car with Alise and her mom?"
336,00:26:23,00:26:25,"No, huh?"
337,00:26:25,00:26:28,"You know, I want to believe you, but, uh, there had to be somebody."
338,00:26:28,00:26:30,Maybe you just didn't see him?
339,00:26:30,00:26:31,Maybe you...
340,00:26:31,00:26:33,and Alise were watching the car wash?
341,00:26:36,00:26:38,Yeah.
342,00:26:38,00:26:40,"Well, let me ask you something: is there..."
343,00:26:40,00:26:44,is there anything that you could tell me that would help me catch the man that hurt Alise's mom?
344,00:26:44,00:26:47,"You can even whisper it, if you want."
345,00:26:47,00:26:49,It's okay. Whisper it in my ear.
346,00:26:51,00:26:55,Sqwee... gel.
347,00:26:55,00:26:58,Excuse me? Could you say that again?
348,00:26:59,00:27:02,Sqwee... gel.
349,00:27:02,00:27:03,MAN: Where is she?
350,00:27:03,00:27:04,Alise! Daddy!
351,00:27:04,00:27:06,"Oh, baby."
352,00:27:06,00:27:08,"Oh, my baby."
353,00:27:08,00:27:10,"(whispers): Oh, my baby."
354,00:27:10,00:27:11,"Oh, my girl."
355,00:27:11,00:27:13,My girl.
356,00:27:23,00:27:26,Do you know anyone who would want to harm your wife?
357,00:27:26,00:27:28,Oh...
358,00:27:28,00:27:29,Uh...
359,00:27:29,00:27:31,"Actually, yes."
360,00:27:31,00:27:33,Really?
361,00:27:33,00:27:35,BRASS: Explain that.
362,00:27:35,00:27:41,"MAN:My wife, uh... she was recently appointed to the Family Values Committee in, uh, Clark County."
363,00:27:41,00:27:43,She got there because she...
364,00:27:43,00:27:46,she single-handedly went up against these...
365,00:27:46,00:27:55,"these big video game companies and banned the sale of, uh,Vehicular Manslaughter and all those other violent first-person games, to minors."
366,00:27:55,00:27:57,Minors.
367,00:27:57,00:27:59,Kids.
368,00:27:59,00:28:05,"Did she receive any, uh, crank calls or hate mail, death threats?"
369,00:28:05,00:28:08,Much more than that. Really?
370,00:28:08,00:28:09,Someone broke into our home.
371,00:28:11,00:28:13,I was at work.
372,00:28:13,00:28:15,Alise was at day care.
373,00:28:15,00:28:16,"Uh, hey, Doc?"
374,00:28:16,00:28:18,"This guy, he..."
375,00:28:18,00:28:20,he put my wife in the hospital.
376,00:28:20,00:28:23,Okay? He cut her up real bad.
377,00:28:25,00:28:29,"ROBBINS: Carrie Jones, our car wash victim, was attacked twice."
378,00:28:29,00:28:31,Most recent was a few hours ago.
379,00:28:31,00:28:35,The first attack was probably no more than a few weeks ago.
380,00:28:35,00:28:36,PHILLIPS: Both are sharp-force injuries.
381,00:28:36,00:28:38,What's your guess on weapon of choice?
382,00:28:39,00:28:42,Could be a box cutter.
383,00:28:42,00:28:43,Maybe a straight razor.
384,00:28:43,00:28:44,Mm-hmm.
385,00:28:46,00:28:48,Ray. Hey.
386,00:28:48,00:28:51,C.O.D. is sharp-force injuries to the neck.
387,00:28:51,00:28:53,Severed the carotid.
388,00:28:53,00:28:55,All the other wounds are defensive.
389,00:28:57,00:29:00,LANGSTON: Some old... some new.
390,00:29:00,00:29:03,I had a conversation with my gut on the way down here.
391,00:29:03,00:29:07,I just want to see if my suspicions are correct.
392,00:29:07,00:29:09,We have...
393,00:29:09,00:29:14,"identical wounds, similar in length, double-edged blade."
394,00:29:14,00:29:20,That means whoever attacked Margot Wilton... killed Carrie Jones.
395,00:29:21,00:29:24,I need to see what was under her bed.
396,00:29:29,00:29:31,STOKES: Dust void.
397,00:29:31,00:29:32,"Well, he was definitely here."
398,00:29:36,00:29:38,BRASS: Sqweegel.
399,00:29:39,00:29:42,That's the name the little girl gave the killer.
400,00:29:42,00:29:45,She was in the car at the car wash when her mother was killed.
401,00:29:45,00:29:50,"Now, I'm guessing is, Sqweegel is the sound that the mops make as they go back and forth across the windshield."
402,00:29:50,00:29:52,"Sqweegel, you know?"
403,00:29:52,00:29:53,LANGSTON: Yeah.
404,00:29:53,00:29:55,Traumatic memory image.
405,00:29:55,00:29:56,"Oh, I got traumatic memory image for you."
406,00:29:56,00:29:58,Deja vu.
407,00:29:58,00:30:01,This is Margot Wilton's place all over again.
408,00:30:01,00:30:12,"You got same M.O., jimmied bathroom window, multiple entries and exits-- I bet if we all look up, we'll find a hole with a lipstick cam in it, no prints, no DNA."
409,00:30:12,00:30:14,There it is.
410,00:30:14,00:30:16,I'm on it.
411,00:30:20,00:30:21,STOKES: Got something here.
412,00:30:24,00:30:26,"Ray, get a shot of this."
413,00:30:26,00:30:28,Uh-huh.
414,00:30:40,00:30:47,"The letter ""A."" Just like the car wash."
415,00:30:47,00:30:49,(passionate breathing)
416,00:30:51,00:30:53,"Lucky for you, I hate my husband."
417,00:30:53,00:30:57,I'll take football over car insurance any day.
418,00:30:57,00:30:58,LANGSTON: Car insurance.
419,00:30:58,00:31:00,Mr. Jones...
420,00:31:00,00:31:02,what do you do for a living?
421,00:31:02,00:31:05,"Turn it off. Just turn it off, please. Very well."
422,00:31:07,00:31:16,"I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, Mr. Jones, but unfortunately, I do have to ask you another question."
423,00:31:16,00:31:20,"Now, we found this, uh..."
424,00:31:20,00:31:22,DVD under your bed.
425,00:31:24,00:31:27,"Now, did you hire a P.I. to follow your wife?"
426,00:31:27,00:31:30,"Well, why would I do that?"
427,00:31:30,00:31:32,You tell me.
428,00:31:32,00:31:35,She's the chair of the Family Values Committee.
429,00:31:35,00:31:42,"Her whole life has been about the truth, honesty and morality."
430,00:31:45,00:31:47,That's what he meant.
431,00:31:47,00:31:50,What are you talking about? That's what he meant.
432,00:31:50,00:31:57,"When Carrie was attacked, she told the police, she said, that animal, he kept saying to her..."
433,00:31:57,00:31:58,"""I know."
434,00:31:58,00:32:06,"Confess."" She said she didn't know what her attacker was talking about-- I think she did."
435,00:32:06,00:32:08,That scarlet letter on the windshield can only mean one thing.
436,00:32:08,00:32:13,"Well, she had a dirty little secret-- she was a party girl, cheating on her husband who didn't have a clue."
437,00:32:13,00:32:14,But Sqweegel did.
438,00:32:14,00:32:23,"Now, he attacked Carrie two weeks ago, didn't kill her, leaves her alive with the message: ""I know. Confess."" Gave her a chance to repent."
439,00:32:23,00:32:26,"I guess she didn't, because he killed her in the car wash."
440,00:32:26,00:32:33,"My thought is, he gave Margot Wilton the chance to repent as well, and if she hasn't, her life's still in danger."
441,00:32:33,00:32:37,"MARGOT: I have lived there for 45 years, and I want to go home."
442,00:32:37,00:32:43,The department has the resources to put you in a hotel and provide round- the-clock security. I don't want to go to a hotel.
443,00:32:43,00:32:45,With a bunch of strangers next to me?
444,00:32:45,00:32:49,Chances of that guy coming back are a million to one.
445,00:32:49,00:32:51,You weren't his only victim.
446,00:32:51,00:32:54,"Gentlemen, this is an unauthorized interview."
447,00:32:54,00:32:59,"You're compromising Mrs. Wilton's right to counsel, not to mention her freedom of movement."
448,00:32:59,00:33:02,"Need I remind you-- she's a victim, not a suspect."
449,00:33:02,00:33:04,"Oscar, we're just trying to keep her safe, that's all."
450,00:33:04,00:33:05,"Oh, Jim, quit with the fear tactics."
451,00:33:05,00:33:07,"LANGSTON: No fear tactics, Mayor Goodman."
452,00:33:07,00:33:09,We have every reason to believe that the first attack was a warning.
453,00:33:09,00:33:11,I'll take my chances.
454,00:33:11,00:33:13,Please take me home.
455,00:33:13,00:33:15,"Jim, I need a minute with her. All right. Oscar."
456,00:33:15,00:33:18,"I need to talk to you privately, please. Over here."
457,00:33:20,00:33:22,Yes?
458,00:33:22,00:33:24,I just need one minute.
459,00:33:26,00:33:29,"""I know."
460,00:33:29,00:33:37,"Confess."" Your attacker said the same thing to a young mother."
461,00:33:37,00:33:41,"Two weeks ago, he attacked her at home, gave her a warning, now she's dead."
462,00:33:41,00:33:45,"What does he want you to confess, Margot?"
463,00:33:45,00:33:48,What does he know that you're not telling us?
464,00:33:48,00:33:53,Does it have something to do with your son or the Key to the City?
465,00:33:54,00:33:57,Your minute's up.
466,00:34:10,00:34:16,"If you so much knock on that door, I'll have you in court tomorrow on harassment."
467,00:34:19,00:34:21,Pardon my bark; she's a friend.
468,00:34:21,00:34:25,"Go over my head, and I'll kill you."
469,00:34:53,00:34:54,No.
470,00:34:55,00:34:57,No. No!
471,00:35:11,00:35:14,(labored breathing)
472,00:35:19,00:35:20,(shouts)
473,00:35:20,00:35:23,Looking for your letters?
474,00:35:29,00:35:31,(Margot yells)
475,00:35:35,00:35:36,"What's going on, Akers?"
476,00:35:36,00:35:38,Got a call about an abandoned vehicle.
477,00:35:38,00:35:40,One of our guys ran the plates and it came back to one of ours.
478,00:35:40,00:35:42,Yeah? Whose is it? Ryan Fink.
479,00:35:42,00:35:43,You know that hero paramedic who saved all those kids?
480,00:35:43,00:35:45,"Yeah, yeah, I know who that is."
481,00:35:45,00:35:48,AKERS: This is the car the city gave him for saving the kids.
482,00:35:48,00:35:50,It's locked up.
483,00:35:50,00:35:52,Looks like I got some blood.
484,00:35:52,00:35:53,Hand me your stick.
485,00:35:56,00:35:59,Exigent circumstances. Watch yourself.
486,00:36:15,00:36:18,"(labored breathing, latex squeaking)"
487,00:36:34,00:36:36,(screaming)
488,00:36:36,00:36:38,"(shouting, gasping)"
489,00:36:38,00:36:41,(yelling)
490,00:36:49,00:36:51,(panting)
491,00:36:55,00:36:59,(screaming)
492,00:36:59,00:37:03,"BRASS: This is not the kind of situation where you just stand by and wait, okay? We gotta go in. Help me out here."
493,00:37:03,00:37:05,Hey. Give me the green light. Okay. I'll stand by and wait.
494,00:37:05,00:37:09,"I just found blood all over Ryan Fink's car, enough to presume he's dead."
495,00:37:09,00:37:13,"Carrie Jones, Ryan Fink, Margot Wilton-- all three honored by the city and now two of them are dead."
496,00:37:13,00:37:14,I guarantee you she's next.
497,00:37:14,00:37:16,The whole team's right behind me. Let's go in.
498,00:37:26,00:37:29,(moans)
499,00:37:39,00:37:41,(grunts)
500,00:37:41,00:37:45,What do you want from me?
501,00:37:45,00:37:47,I think you know.
502,00:37:47,00:37:50,I don't know anything.
503,00:37:50,00:37:53,You know everything.
504,00:37:53,00:37:56,I read your letters.
505,00:37:56,00:38:00,I heard your phone calls.
506,00:38:00,00:38:04,I even watched while you slept.
507,00:38:04,00:38:09,I know why you toss and turn at night.
508,00:38:09,00:38:13,It's hard to be still in Robbie's nightmare.
509,00:38:13,00:38:16,(strains): He was my baby.
510,00:38:16,00:38:18,"(sobs) He was so sick, he was in pain."
511,00:38:18,00:38:24,"He'd cry, every night, in his chair."
512,00:38:24,00:38:25,He was trapped and so was I.
513,00:38:25,00:38:27,Tell me about the pool.
514,00:38:27,00:38:29,How your son's death was an act of mercy.
515,00:38:29,00:38:31,A mother's love.
516,00:38:31,00:38:32,"Oh, you bastard."
517,00:38:32,00:38:33,You don't know the whole story.
518,00:38:33,00:38:34,I know everything!
519,00:38:34,00:38:36,All right!
520,00:38:36,00:38:39,"All right, I know that you know."
521,00:38:39,00:38:43,"But you have to understand, my son was dying."
522,00:38:43,00:38:44,Say it.
523,00:38:45,00:38:49,Robbie drowned...
524,00:38:49,00:38:54,and it was not an accident.
525,00:38:54,00:38:58,I killed him.
526,00:38:58,00:39:08,"Imurderedmy son, 'cause I believed in my heart that it was the right thing to do."
527,00:39:15,00:39:17,Mrs. Wilton?
528,00:39:17,00:39:19,Are you hurt? I shot him.
529,00:39:19,00:39:21,Which way'd he go? I don't know. I shot him.
530,00:39:21,00:39:22,"Five shots, no blood?"
531,00:39:22,00:39:26,The case mouths are crimped. He replaced her real ammo with blanks. This guy thought of everything.
532,00:39:26,00:39:28,"BRASS: Mitch, get her out of here."
533,00:39:28,00:39:29,"Nick, check upstairs."
534,00:39:29,00:39:31,"The rest of you, on me."
535,00:39:31,00:39:32,Let's go find this bastard.
536,00:39:32,00:39:33,Let's go.
537,00:39:35,00:39:38,"Lady, we've got to get out of here now."
538,00:39:38,00:39:40,No! My letters!
539,00:39:40,00:39:42,My letters!
540,00:40:31,00:40:32,Ray?
541,00:40:33,00:40:35,It's all right.
542,00:40:38,00:40:40,Tache noir.
543,00:40:40,00:40:42,The exposed sclera has gone black.
544,00:40:42,00:40:47,"(sniffs) He's got a little bit of a stench coming off of him, so he's been dead for a couple of hours."
545,00:40:47,00:40:48,How can that be?
546,00:40:48,00:40:49,(grunts)
547,00:40:51,00:40:54,That's Ryan Fink.
548,00:40:54,00:40:56,The paramedic?
549,00:40:56,00:40:57,STOKES: Yup.
550,00:41:02,00:41:05,LANGSTON: You see the scars?
551,00:41:05,00:41:08,"Attacked first, then killed."
552,00:41:08,00:41:11,Just like Carrie Jones.
553,00:41:11,00:41:12,Whew!
554,00:41:12,00:41:16,Margot Wilton was lucky.
555,00:41:16,00:41:18,That's why he bought two suits.
556,00:41:18,00:41:20,But why put them under the bed?
557,00:41:20,00:41:25,I think our answer is in the wind.
558,00:41:49,00:41:55,"MARGOT: Dear Henry, I hope I have the courage to send you this letter."
559,00:41:55,00:42:00,"Because you're his father, I owe you the truth about our son."
560,00:42:00,00:42:03,Robbie begged me to end his suffering.
561,00:42:03,00:42:06,"He was failing, more and more each day."
562,00:42:06,00:42:08,I can't.
563,00:42:08,00:42:10,You can if you love me.
564,00:42:16,00:42:19,I did a terrible thing.
565,00:42:22,00:42:25,I just stood there...
566,00:42:25,00:42:27,watching him.
567,00:42:27,00:42:31,I'll never forgive myself.
568,00:42:56,00:42:59,It's no wonder she insisted on going back to her house.
569,00:42:59,00:43:01,She needed to get the letters.
570,00:43:01,00:43:03,That was her secret.
571,00:43:03,00:43:05,BRASS: I got a call from the fire chief.
572,00:43:05,00:43:09,Some tipsters have been calling the fire department hotline.
573,00:43:09,00:43:12,There's evidence this guy Fink had been setting fires to make himself look like a hero.
574,00:43:12,00:43:15,That's hissecret.
575,00:43:15,00:43:20,And the biggest secret of all: who is Ian Moone?
576,00:43:27,00:43:29,(labored breathing)
577,00:43:35,00:43:38,I am no one.
