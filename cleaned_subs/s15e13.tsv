0	00:00:01	00:00:08	FINLAY A man's been wrongfully imprisoned.
1	00:00:08	00:00:11	Who knew that psychopath Briscoe had a twin?
2	00:00:11	00:00:13	Do you think the brothers were working together?
3	00:00:13	00:00:20	My brother Jared is going to have a new day in court. We're investigating the disappearance of my partner, Keri Torres.
4	00:00:20	00:00:30	Maya. When I was little, D.B., if you're not willing to put Maya into play in some kind of a way... The greater good.
5	00:00:30	00:00:32	Keri's gonna make it.
6	00:00:34	00:00:35	Sir, you can't be here.
7	00:00:35	00:00:37	You've been a bad boy.
8	00:00:39	00:00:39	Get in.
9	00:01:18	00:01:19	Hello, Maya.
10	00:01:21	00:01:23	It's been a long time-- remember me?
11	00:01:34	00:01:35	Please, don't.
12	00:01:35	00:01:36	Shh.
13	00:01:39	00:01:45	My brother once taught me-- a long time ago-- he said, If you love someone...
14	00:01:46	00:01:48	...set them free.
15	00:01:51	00:01:52	Aah!
16	00:01:52	00:01:55	I could never hurt you.
17	00:01:58	00:01:59	I love you.
18	00:02:05	00:02:07	Aren't you gonna run, hmm? (kissing) (whimpering)
19	00:02:07	00:02:10	Come on. Yeah, like that.
20	00:02:11	00:02:12	Oh! (cackling)
21	00:02:15	00:02:17	You're so beautiful like this.
22	00:02:17	00:02:18	I can do this all night.
23	00:02:18	00:02:19	Oh!
24	00:02:23	00:02:26	No, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.
25	00:02:42	00:02:45	Look, Dad, I don't want to argue with you about this.
26	00:02:45	00:02:48	I just want to go home. Back to Seattle.
27	00:02:48	00:02:50	Hey, come on, we've talked about this before, honey.
28	00:02:51	00:02:54	With everything that's going on-- Gig Harbor all over again.
29	00:02:54	00:02:57	Look, you said yourself you don't feel safe.
30	00:02:57	00:02:59	Well, it's easier for me to keep you safe here.
31	00:02:59	00:03:03	I know what I said, but that's because I was alone and scared.
32	00:03:03	00:03:09	But Ryan's getting back from London, and Katie's coming home from his folks' ranch.
33	00:03:09	00:03:11	Dad, I appreciate everything you've done.
34	00:03:11	00:03:13	Control, One-David-42, all clear.
35	00:03:13	00:03:15	Roger that, David-42.
36	00:03:15	00:03:17	I know you just want to protect me, but...
37	00:03:18	00:03:20	I've got to get back to my life.
38	00:03:20	00:03:22	All right, I'm sorry, you're right, you're right.
39	00:03:22	00:03:25	We worry, right?
40	00:03:25	00:03:26	And I love you for it.
41	00:03:28	00:03:29	I booked a flight.
42	00:03:29	00:03:31	Tonight. I have a taxi picking me up.
43	00:03:31	00:03:33	No, no, I'll drive you there myself.
44	00:03:33	00:03:35	But you said you have that meeting with the sheriff.
45	00:03:35	00:03:36	Dad, it's fine.
46	00:03:36	00:03:38	All right, okay, but no-no... no taxis.
47	00:03:38	00:03:42	I'll, um... I'll have Detective Crawford pick you up.
48	00:03:42	00:03:45	No arguments. You hear me?
49	00:03:45	00:03:47	I hear you.
50	00:03:47	00:03:49	I love you, Dad.
51	00:03:49	00:03:50	I love you, too.
52	00:03:50	00:03:52	I'll call you from Seattle.
53	00:03:52	00:03:57	No, no, no, hey-- you will call me when you get to the airport here, and then you will call me from Seattle.
54	00:03:57	00:04:00	Okay, now you need to stop being a worrywart.
55	00:04:00	00:04:02	Not gonna happen.
56	00:04:03	00:04:04	Bye.
57	00:04:04	00:04:05	Bye.
58	00:04:08	00:04:09	It's happening tonight.
59	00:05:02	00:05:05	Thank you. Yeah.
60	00:05:10	00:05:13	You look good, Jared. Today's the big day.
61	00:05:13	00:05:16	I don't understand...
62	00:05:16	00:05:17	any of this.
63	00:05:17	00:05:19	The judge reviewed the evidence.
64	00:05:19	00:05:21	Nothing ties you forensically to the murders.
65	00:05:21	00:05:24	He's thrown out your confession. You're gonna be a free man.
66	00:05:24	00:05:25	You're not listening to me.
67	00:05:25	00:05:28	Why am I here?
68	00:05:28	00:05:30	Jared, you listen to me.
69	00:05:30	00:05:32	This was not the plan.
70	00:05:32	00:05:36	You said, if I make a sacrifice, in return, I would live forever.
71	00:05:36	00:05:38	Ah, yeah.
72	00:05:40	00:05:42	Plans change.
73	00:05:42	00:05:43	Why?
74	00:05:43	00:05:45	I need you.
75	00:05:45	00:05:46	You need me.
76	00:05:46	00:05:47	Don't you miss what we had?
77	00:05:47	00:05:49	Of course I do.
78	00:05:49	00:05:51	So I say we can have it again.
79	00:05:51	00:05:55	And this time, I promise you, it'll be so much better.
80	00:05:55	00:05:57	And why should I trust you?
81	00:05:57	00:06:00	How can you say that? Look at me. Look in my eyes.
82	00:06:00	00:06:01	My eyes are your eyes.
83	00:06:01	00:06:03	My heart is your heart.
84	00:06:07	00:06:10	When is it happening?
85	00:06:10	00:06:13	If all goes according to plan, you'll be a free man in a few hours.
86	00:06:13	00:06:14	And we'll celebrate.
87	00:06:14	00:06:17	In Vegas.
88	00:06:17	00:06:19	I'll even have a little gift for you.
89	00:06:19	00:06:23	Something you've been dreaming about for a very long time.
90	00:06:23	00:06:25	I stand before you today a man fulfilled.
91	00:06:25	00:06:29	A man whose prayers have been answered.
92	00:06:29	00:06:35	Because today, after four long years of incarceration, my brother Jared Briscoe is a free man.
93	00:06:35	00:06:45	But Jared will not truly be free until those who have wrongfully imprisoned him are brought to account, and I will not rest until I've made them pay.
94	00:06:48	00:06:49	I don't believe this.
95	00:06:49	00:06:51	I heard Winthrop's gonna sue Seattle PD.
96	00:06:51	00:06:53	I'm waiting to be served myself, any day.
97	00:06:53	00:06:55	D.B., we cannot let this stand.
98	00:06:55	00:06:59	What are we gonna do? We're dead in the water here.
99	00:06:59	00:07:03	Keri Torres may be out of the hospital; she can't remember a thing about who kidnapped her.
100	00:07:03	00:07:04	Hodges is working on something.
101	00:07:04	00:07:07	That's news to me. Well, you know how he is.
102	00:07:07	00:07:12	What does he have? All he would tell me is that the strings from the crime scenes are starting to sing to him.
103	00:07:12	00:07:13	That's very helpful.
104	00:07:13	00:07:15	Russell. Yeah?
105	00:07:15	00:07:18	00, take her to the airport.
106	00:07:18	00:07:19	Thank you.
107	00:07:20	00:07:21	Maya's leaving?
108	00:07:21	00:07:23	Yeah, she's, uh, she's going back home.
109	00:07:23	00:07:26	For what it's worth, it was a good idea.
110	00:07:26	00:07:29	Yeah, I got to say I'm surprised that Winthrop didn't try to make a move, though.
111	00:07:29	00:07:32	I thought that Maya was down here visiting.
112	00:07:32	00:07:33	She was.
113	00:07:33	00:07:35	Wait a minute.
114	00:07:35	00:07:37	You took Avery Ryan's advice?
115	00:07:37	00:07:42	Does Maya know that she was down here as bait?
116	00:07:42	00:07:45	In case you wanted to know, we had her under surveillance 24-7.
117	00:07:45	00:07:46	I'd hardly call that bait.
118	00:07:46	00:07:48	Really?
119	00:07:48	00:07:49	And what would you call it?
120	00:07:52	00:07:53	The greater good.
121	00:08:12	00:08:13	You cannot be serious.
122	00:08:13	00:08:14	Never had one lesson.
123	00:08:14	00:08:16	Shocking.
124	00:08:16	00:08:18	And this stuff isn't too pleasant, either.
125	00:08:18	00:08:22	And yet it makes such beautiful music.
126	00:08:22	00:08:25	You're replicating the process that the killer used to make the strings for the crime scene.
127	00:08:25	00:08:27	The process, yes. The material, no.
128	00:08:27	00:08:31	Oh, well, so good to know you're not using real human tissue.
129	00:08:31	00:08:34	Although I haven't seen Henry around lately. (laughs)
130	00:08:34	00:08:35	Very funny.
131	00:08:35	00:08:37	You are looking at catgut.
132	00:08:37	00:08:45	Catgut is used not just to produce strings for instruments, but also strings for tennis rackets as well as sutures.
133	00:08:45	00:08:51	Catgut isn't cat gut. It's usually sheep or goat...
134	00:08:51	00:08:53	Interesting fact three is the part where this has something to do with anything.
135	00:08:53	00:08:58	String manufacture like this is extremely hard to do.
136	00:08:58	00:09:02	At least at the level of competence shown by our killer.
137	00:09:02	00:09:12	Meaning what? Meaning either our killer was an expert, which doesn't fit Paul Winthrop's résumé, or our killer recruited an expert and forced that person to do his stringing.
138	00:09:12	00:09:14	Evidence suggests the latter.
139	00:09:14	00:09:15	It suggests more than that.
140	00:09:17	00:09:18	Did the research.
141	00:09:18	00:09:23	There are half a dozen experts in the art of string craft west of the Mississippi.
142	00:09:23	00:09:25	One of them is in Vegas.
143	00:09:25	00:09:26	That face look familiar to you?
144	00:09:26	00:09:29	That's the woman that the killer held at The Mizu.
145	00:09:29	00:09:30	The one that Finlay shot.
146	00:09:30	00:09:33	Aah! Aah! Di...
147	00:09:33	00:09:36	She was never I.D.'d. No one ever reported her missing.
148	00:09:36	00:09:40	Huh. And now, thanks to this, we have her address.
149	00:09:40	00:09:41	Mm-hmm.
150	00:09:41	00:09:43	You want to go along?
151	00:09:43	00:09:44	Get a little fresh air?
152	00:09:44	00:09:46	For you? Yes.
153	00:09:54	00:09:56	The lock is busted.
154	00:09:56	00:09:57	Somebody broke in.
155	00:09:58	00:10:00	Oh, oh, boy.
156	00:10:00	00:10:02	You promised me fresh air.
157	00:10:02	00:10:05	Is that, uh... Yeah, it's exactly what you think it is.
158	00:10:06	00:10:07	All right, wait here, all right?
159	00:10:07	00:10:09	Whoa, whoa, hey, d-don't you need backup?
160	00:10:09	00:10:11	Don't you need a gun?
161	00:10:11	00:10:14	Seriously, just stay here while I clear the place.
162	00:10:14	00:10:15	Copy that.
163	00:10:34	00:10:36	Whew.
164	00:10:50	00:10:51	The house is clear!
165	00:10:51	00:10:53	Got a body, though.
166	00:10:53	00:10:57	Woman.
167	00:10:57	00:10:58	She's been here for a while.
168	00:11:03	00:11:04	Someone enjoys reading about himself.
169	00:11:07	00:11:11	Looks like our killer has been camping out in Rebecca Lowell's house.
170	00:11:11	00:11:12	Bad deal for her.
171	00:11:12	00:11:16	Enslaved to make his strings, then he squats in her digs.
172	00:11:16	00:11:18	Any idea who the dead woman was?
173	00:11:18	00:11:21	No, but hopefully we'll get an I.D.
174	00:11:21	00:11:25	You know, this place seems a little down-rent for a guy like Paul Winthrop to squat in.
175	00:11:25	00:11:29	We have assumed that he's been working with a partner since he's been in Vegas, right?
176	00:11:29	00:11:30	Yeah. So...
177	00:11:30	00:11:32	maybe it's more his style.
178	00:11:36	00:11:38	Ants.
179	00:11:38	00:11:39	I hate ants.
180	00:11:44	00:11:46	How do you feel about body parts?
181	00:11:54	00:11:57	All units. All units. We have a 444. Shots fired.
182	00:11:57	00:12:00	Officer needs assistance. Corner of Highland and Branch.
183	00:12:00	00:12:02	Code 3. Control, this is One-David-42.
184	00:12:02	00:12:04	Currently two blocks from that location.
185	00:12:04	00:12:09	We are responding but will require backup at 923 Altos Drive.
186	00:12:21	00:12:24	Hi there. You requested a ride to the airport?
187	00:12:24	00:12:27	I-I thought Detective Crawford was gonna take me.
188	00:12:27	00:12:29	Yeah, he got called away. I'm Detective Shaw.
189	00:12:29	00:12:32	I promise I'm just as safe a driver.
190	00:12:33	00:12:34	Don't I know you?
191	00:12:34	00:12:38	Yeah. I used to work in Seattle with your dad.
192	00:12:38	00:12:42	He just thought a familiar face might make you feel a little more comfortable.
193	00:12:42	00:12:43	You're here a little early.
194	00:12:43	00:12:47	Yeah, I know. I probably should have called, but there's a pileup on the I-15.
195	00:12:47	00:12:48	Oh. Well, okay.
196	00:12:48	00:12:50	Um, better safe than sorry.
197	00:12:50	00:12:53	Can I get your bag? Mm-hmm.
198	00:12:55	00:12:57	Hey. Got your text.
199	00:12:57	00:13:00	You have something on the bodies Morgan and Hodges found?
200	00:13:00	00:13:02	Not all of them.
201	00:13:02	00:13:04	This poor woman remains unidentified.
202	00:13:04	00:13:13	But according to DNA, these body parts came from Emily Bartson and Pamela Kramer. Two missing girls here in Vegas.
203	00:13:13	00:13:15	After all these weeks, we found 'em.
204	00:13:15	00:13:16	That's not all we found.
205	00:13:16	00:13:18	Finn, you're gonna want to see this.
206	00:13:18	00:13:24	We recovered partial prints from Rebecca Lowell's house. In the kitchen, in the living room, in the bedroom. Everywhere.
207	00:13:24	00:13:26	The prints came back to Daniel Shaw.
208	00:13:26	00:13:29	He's been there.
209	00:13:29	00:13:30	Staying there.
210	00:13:30	00:13:32	Shaw is Winthrop's partner.
211	00:13:43	00:13:46	So, you worked with my dad in Seattle?
212	00:13:46	00:13:48	That's right. Then you must know Julie Finlay, too.
213	00:13:48	00:13:50	Yeah, I do.
214	00:13:50	00:13:52	How long you been in Vegas?
215	00:13:52	00:13:56	Not long. My dad drag you down here, like Finn?
216	00:13:58	00:14:01	Yeah. Yeah, I guess you might say that.
217	00:14:04	00:14:06	It's funny. My dad talks about Finn all the time.
218	00:14:08	00:14:11	He's never mentioned you.
219	00:14:11	00:14:14	I guess we're just not as close.
220	00:14:23	00:14:26	I think, uh, you missed the turn.
221	00:14:26	00:14:28	Airport's back that way.
222	00:14:28	00:14:29	I'm going another way.
223	00:14:33	00:14:35	You're not taking me to the airport, are you?
224	00:14:38	00:14:40	No.
225	00:14:49	00:14:52	I don't know, Conrad. The situation's fluid right now.
226	00:14:52	00:14:55	Yeah. My house is a crime scene.
227	00:14:55	00:14:57	They're processing it right now.
228	00:14:57	00:15:01	And as for Maya, I have every available unit on.
229	00:15:01	00:15:04	I know. I know. Thank you.
230	00:15:04	00:15:05	I hope so, too.
231	00:15:06	00:15:10	D.B., I heard about Maya. What happened?
232	00:15:10	00:15:15	Surveillance team was pulled off by a false 444 call.
233	00:15:15	00:15:17	Somebody slipped in before Crawford could get there.
234	00:15:17	00:15:19	We found Shaw's fingerprints at the house with the bodies.
235	00:15:19	00:15:20	Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.
236	00:15:20	00:15:22	What do you mean?
237	00:15:22	00:15:25	Keep walking with me for a minute.
238	00:15:26	00:15:28	This is One-David-30. Crossing Bartlet.
239	00:15:28	00:15:30	Proceeding northbound.
240	00:15:30	00:15:34	One-David-One. Crossing Temple. We still got a visual on the suspect vehicle? Copy that, One-David-Ten.
241	00:15:34	00:15:39	All units, be advised, suspect vehicle is continuing north on Everly Boulevard.
242	00:15:39	00:15:41	Where are you taking me?
243	00:15:41	00:15:44	It's probably best if we don't talk.
244	00:15:44	00:15:46	We have to talk.
245	00:15:46	00:15:47	No, we don't.
246	00:15:48	00:15:50	I can't believe you let this happen.
247	00:15:50	00:15:52	Like I said, we had surveillance 24-7.
248	00:15:52	00:15:54	For the greater good?
249	00:15:55	00:15:57	Maya agreed to wear the wire.
250	00:15:57	00:15:59	She wants to put these guys away.
251	00:15:59	00:16:00	For all of those women.
252	00:16:00	00:16:01	And for herself, too.
253	00:16:01	00:16:03	She wants to end the nightmares.
254	00:16:03	00:16:05	Well, you're playing a very dangerous game.
255	00:16:05	00:16:07	It's not a game at all. We know Winthrop's M.O.
256	00:16:07	00:16:09	Shaw is not going to hurt Maya.
257	00:16:09	00:16:11	Not at least until he delivers her to Winthrop.
258	00:16:11	00:16:13	And we'll have eyes on the whole time.
259	00:16:13	00:16:15	Winthrop shows up, we take 'em out.
260	00:16:15	00:16:16	Who else knows about this?
261	00:16:16	00:16:20	Present company, Ecklie, and Nick and Greg are in the follow car.
262	00:16:20	00:16:21	Along with eight support units.
263	00:16:21	00:16:24	Operation like this, the fewer people that know about it, the better.
264	00:16:24	00:16:27	Charlie-04-Stokes. We've got eyes on and are hanging back.
265	00:16:27	00:16:30	What are you guys seeing out there, Nick?
266	00:16:30	00:16:31	Not much.
267	00:16:31	00:16:34	Looks like this guy's just out for a Sunday drive.
268	00:16:34	00:16:37	I don't think we've been made. He hasn't tried to shake us.
269	00:16:38	00:16:40	Let me talk to you for a sec.
270	00:16:40	00:16:42	Look, you don't agree with what I'm doing.
271	00:16:42	00:16:43	That goes without saying.
272	00:16:43	00:16:45	Something is really bothering me.
273	00:16:45	00:16:47	Tell me. I want to know.
274	00:16:47	00:16:52	I know what the evidence says, and I know what this looks like, but something is not adding up.
275	00:16:52	00:16:55	I need to see the evidence in Rebecca Lowell's house for myself.
276	00:17:06	00:17:08	Hey. Hey, David.
277	00:17:08	00:17:10	You get an I.D. on the woman I found in the bed?
278	00:17:10	00:17:12	No name. Not yet.
279	00:17:12	00:17:16	But DNA came back. The dead woman was Rebecca Lowell's sister.
280	00:17:16	00:17:18	What was her C.O.D.?
281	00:17:18	00:17:20	A broken hyoid bone.
282	00:17:20	00:17:23	Suggests asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.
283	00:17:23	00:17:25	That's inconsistent with our killer's M.O.
284	00:17:25	00:17:30	So far, in Gig Harbor and Vegas, the women were beaten and stabbed.
285	00:17:30	00:17:32	Looks like you got a whole larvae farm there.
286	00:17:32	00:17:33	I know. And it's weird.
287	00:17:33	00:17:36	I found two distinct sets of first instar larvae.
288	00:17:36	00:17:40	The white are blowflies, and the brown are beetles.
289	00:17:40	00:17:42	The beetle and the blowfly are natural enemies.
290	00:17:42	00:17:47	And natural enemies suggests to me that the eggs weren't laid at the same time.
291	00:17:47	00:17:54	Put that together with the fact that neither insect developed past first instar, and I think we're looking at a sequence of events here.
292	00:17:54	00:17:56	So you're thinking that these bodies were moved.
293	00:17:56	00:17:57	Multiple times.
294	00:17:57	00:18:00	(buzzing) Frozen and refrozen.
295	00:18:00	00:18:09	Blowflies laid their eggs, the larvae froze to death, and then in a different place and time, the beetles had their chance.
296	00:18:11	00:18:18	If I can identify these species, isolate them to a specific habitat, it might give us a map to the killer's movements.
297	00:18:23	00:18:28	We just turned onto Corvell. RUSSELL is he going? I don't know. I don't get it.
298	00:18:28	00:18:30	All right, hold on. He's turning down an alley.
299	00:18:41	00:18:42	The car's stopped.
300	00:18:42	00:18:45	It's just sitting there.
301	00:18:45	00:18:48	Why are we stopping here?
302	00:18:48	00:18:50	Don't run.
303	00:18:59	00:19:01	He's making a call.
304	00:19:01	00:19:04	I can't hear anything.
305	00:19:07	00:19:10	I'm scared, Dad.
306	00:19:10	00:19:11	I keep thinking...
307	00:19:13	00:19:14	what would you do?
308	00:19:15	00:19:17	I know that's what's gonna get me through this.
309	00:19:20	00:19:21	Love you, Dad.
310	00:19:23	00:19:24	I love you, too.
311	00:19:31	00:19:35	That person on the other end of the line, is that why you're doing this?
312	00:19:35	00:19:37	What do you want from me?
313	00:19:37	00:19:38	I just want the truth.
314	00:19:38	00:19:42	If I'm gonna die, I think I at least deserve that much.
315	00:19:42	00:19:45	You think that's gonna make it any easier?
316	00:20:11	00:20:12	Hodges.
317	00:20:12	00:20:14	What are you doing here?
318	00:20:14	00:20:16	Well, Morgan told me to stay, collect evidence.
319	00:20:16	00:20:19	In the dark? You ever heard of work lights?
320	00:20:19	00:20:24	My mentor, Grissom, taught me to see the scene as the killer saw it. That's great.
321	00:20:24	00:20:26	But I would prefer work lights.
322	00:20:26	00:20:27	Sorry.
323	00:20:27	00:20:29	It's not my fault that these floors are old and creaky.
324	00:20:29	00:20:30	What are you doing here anyway?
325	00:20:30	00:20:32	You found Shaw's prints here, right?
326	00:20:32	00:20:35	Everywhere. Everywhere?
327	00:20:36	00:20:41	On the clippings, the work table and the freezer? Well, no, not there, exactly.
328	00:20:41	00:20:47	I just suspect that when he wasn't lounging around, he was in serial killer mode and... wore gloves.
329	00:20:49	00:20:55	Um, far be it from me to listen to office gossip, but I understand that you and Shaw were close...
330	00:20:55	00:20:56	Hodges. I-I'm sorry.
331	00:20:56	00:20:58	Boundaries. I get it.
332	00:20:58	00:21:00	Did you move this table?
333	00:21:00	00:21:02	Ah, well, my mentor...
334	00:21:02	00:21:04	The answer would be no.
335	00:21:04	00:21:06	Somebody moved the table.
336	00:21:06	00:21:08	Want to give me a hand? Sure.
337	00:21:12	00:21:14	See what I mean about the floors?
338	00:21:22	00:21:23	Look at that.
339	00:21:29	00:21:30	And that is why you're a CSI.
340	00:21:59	00:22:00	Ran the partials from the strongbox.
341	00:22:00	00:22:05	They came back to our homeowner and string maker, Rebecca Lowell.
342	00:22:05	00:22:08	I don't think she was just making money from making strings.
343	00:22:08	00:22:10	Did you find something on the flash drive?
344	00:22:10	00:22:12	Files from an escort service.
345	00:22:12	00:22:14	Lady Aquarius Escorts, to be exact.
346	00:22:14	00:22:21	All of our victims are involved in the sex trade, but we never knew how they were connected, or who was pimping them out.
347	00:22:21	00:22:23	They were all working for Rebecca Lowell?
348	00:22:23	00:22:25	File says yes.
349	00:22:26	00:22:28	Those are the names of all our victims.
350	00:22:28	00:22:29	And there's quite a client list, too.
351	00:22:29	00:22:32	Lots of prominent men, including Paul Winthrop.
352	00:22:32	00:22:34	Talk about a smoking gun.
353	00:22:34	00:22:36	For solicitation, not for murder. Hmm.
354	00:22:36	00:22:39	I was looking at the receipts.
355	00:22:39	00:22:41	We are talking a lot of money.
356	00:22:41	00:22:43	Well, it's not surprising given the clientele.
357	00:22:43	00:22:46	What is the difference between a client and a friend?
358	00:22:46	00:22:48	Is it a price point? I don't know.
359	00:22:48	00:22:49	I was just getting there.
360	00:22:52	00:22:56	Those are cops and judges from Las Vegas and from Seattle.
361	00:22:56	00:22:58	Money says bribes, protection.
362	00:22:58	00:23:00	Mm-hmm.
363	00:23:01	00:23:04	Shaw's on the list.
364	00:23:04	00:23:05	I don't believe it.
365	00:23:05	00:23:06	Cop on the take.
366	00:23:06	00:23:07	This connects him to Winthrop.
367	00:23:15	00:23:18	I have a daughter-- Kaitlyn.
368	00:23:18	00:23:20	She comes home from her grandparents' tomorrow.
369	00:23:22	00:23:24	Your dad taught you well.
370	00:23:24	00:23:27	How to humanize yourself in the eyes of a killer.
371	00:23:27	00:23:29	Do you have kids?
372	00:23:29	00:23:32	What does it matter?
373	00:23:32	00:23:34	Do you?
374	00:23:34	00:23:37	It's not going to work.
375	00:23:39	00:23:41	Then just tell me this.
376	00:23:41	00:23:43	Why me?
377	00:23:43	00:23:47	I know enough about those other girls to know that I'm not like them.
378	00:23:49	00:23:51	You're nothing like them.
379	00:23:51	00:23:54	Then why?
380	00:23:54	00:23:56	Is it because of my dad?
381	00:23:57	00:23:59	It's not just that.
382	00:24:04	00:24:06	Okay, he's making another turn.
383	00:24:06	00:24:08	It's like he keeps going in a circle.
384	00:24:08	00:24:10	No, he's going back to the airport.
385	00:24:10	00:24:13	Winthrop got his brother released sometime this afternoon, right?
386	00:24:13	00:24:15	What time did they fly out of Seattle?
387	00:24:15	00:24:16	We have that information, right?
388	00:24:18	00:24:21	Winthrop's private jet took off from Seattle four hours ago.
389	00:24:21	00:24:22	That means they've already landed.
390	00:24:22	00:24:24	Guys, I think this is happening.
391	00:24:24	00:24:29	The meet's going down with Winthrop somewhere around the Executive Terminal at the airport.
392	00:24:47	00:24:50	He's going into a garage under an industrial building.
393	00:24:50	00:24:52	1017 Parkman Way.
394	00:24:52	00:24:54	Pull up that location.
395	00:24:59	00:25:00	That's Winthrop's building.
396	00:25:00	00:25:04	There's only one way in and one way out of this garage.
397	00:25:04	00:25:07	We go in, we're gonna get made.
398	00:25:07	00:25:09	What do you want to do?
399	00:25:11	00:25:14	Let's stick with the plan.
400	00:25:14	00:25:15	We wait for Winthrop.
401	00:25:26	00:25:28	What is this place?
402	00:25:30	00:25:32	Is this where it's gonna happen?
403	00:25:32	00:25:34	Quiet.
404	00:25:34	00:25:36	Just listen.
405	00:25:44	00:25:47	I went to a recital once.
406	00:25:47	00:25:50	Music like this. Strings.
407	00:25:52	00:25:54	There was a young girl playing the violin.
408	00:25:55	00:25:57	It was beautiful.
409	00:25:57	00:25:59	She was beautiful.
410	00:25:59	00:26:02	I couldn't believe that something so beautiful...
411	00:26:02	00:26:03	could be mine.
412	00:26:08	00:26:12	But at the same time, I knew I didn't deserve her.
413	00:26:12	00:26:15	'Cause everything I touch, I destroy.
414	00:26:16	00:26:19	Because men like me are weak.
415	00:26:19	00:26:22	Because of that weakness, they commit crimes.
416	00:26:22	00:26:23	They commit sins.
417	00:26:23	00:26:26	Sins for which there is no going back.
418	00:26:27	00:26:29	She doesn't say anything.
419	00:26:29	00:26:31	Why isn't she saying anything?
420	00:26:31	00:26:32	There-there's something wrong. Damn it!
421	00:26:32	00:26:34	Guys, go in now!
422	00:26:34	00:26:36	All units, converge now!
423	00:26:39	00:26:44	I want you to understand, I need you to understand, I didn't want this.
424	00:26:44	00:26:47	I didn't ask for this. I didn't choose this.
425	00:26:47	00:26:49	The choice was made for me.
426	00:26:49	00:26:53	Some things are just... ordained.
427	00:26:53	00:26:57	I sinned.
428	00:26:57	00:26:59	I sinned, and now you and I are both paying...
429	00:26:59	00:27:03	Son of a bitch played us.
430	00:27:03	00:27:06	Russell, she's gone.
431	00:27:16	00:27:18	Nick, what happened?
432	00:27:18	00:27:23	Shaw pulled Maya's wire and left it in the car along with a digital recording of his voice.
433	00:27:23	00:27:25	Made it sound like they were still in there talking.
434	00:27:25	00:27:27	Any idea how they got out of there?
435	00:27:27	00:27:28	No, we're still working on that.
436	00:27:28	00:27:31	Hey, Nick? Over here.
437	00:27:31	00:27:33	Hey, I think we just found Shaw's escape route.
438	00:27:33	00:27:35	We're checking it out right now.
439	00:27:35	00:27:36	Keep me posted.
440	00:27:49	00:27:50	They're long gone.
441	00:27:50	00:27:53	Well, look around here, man. There's got to be something.
442	00:27:57	00:27:59	Hey, here you go, Greg.
443	00:27:59	00:28:01	Come over here and take a look at this.
444	00:28:01	00:28:02	It's a wedding ring.
445	00:28:02	00:28:04	You think it's Maya's?
446	00:28:04	00:28:07	I do. She's a CSI's daughter, man.
447	00:28:07	00:28:08	She's a smart girl.
448	00:28:08	00:28:11	Leaving evidence behind like bread crumbs.
449	00:28:13	00:28:16	Next to what looks like tire treads.
450	00:28:16	00:28:18	Somebody peeled out of here.
451	00:28:18	00:28:20	I think she's trying to tell us they switched cars.
452	00:28:22	00:28:25	That might not be all she's trying to tell us.
453	00:28:25	00:28:27	Flecks of red paint here.
454	00:28:27	00:28:29	Must have been from the driver's door.
455	00:28:29	00:28:34	Shaw gives her the keys, tells her to drive.
456	00:28:34	00:28:39	She drops her ring by the rear tire and scratches the door getting in.
457	00:28:39	00:28:41	Tire impressions and paint.
458	00:28:41	00:28:43	Could tell us what they're driving.
459	00:28:49	00:28:51	How is he doing?
460	00:28:51	00:28:52	Not good.
461	00:28:52	00:28:54	Beating himself up.
462	00:28:54	00:28:56	He's not the only one.
463	00:28:56	00:28:59	I get it. We all want to get Winthrop and Briscoe.
464	00:28:59	00:29:00	And that son of a bitch, Shaw.
465	00:29:02	00:29:04	Should have heard him.
466	00:29:04	00:29:05	Talking about his exploits.
467	00:29:05	00:29:09	Some story about stalking a girl at a recital.
468	00:29:09	00:29:13	Who knows how many women he and those brothers have killed?
469	00:29:13	00:29:15	What exactly did he say about the girl at the recital?
470	00:29:15	00:29:20	His exact words were, It's hard to believe something so beautiful could be mine.
471	00:29:20	00:29:22	You scumbag. That's it.
472	00:29:22	00:29:24	That's what? I got to go.
473	00:29:24	00:29:25	Will you keep an eye on him?
474	00:29:25	00:29:29	I have only seen him like this once before, and it was not good.
475	00:29:37	00:29:39	You don't have to worry.
476	00:29:39	00:29:41	I'm not gonna run.
477	00:29:41	00:29:45	I'm not even gonna scream when you do to me whatever it is you're gonna do.
478	00:29:45	00:29:48	I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction.
479	00:29:48	00:29:52	You know, when I was a cop in Seattle, I didn't have much respect for people.
480	00:29:53	00:29:54	But I always respected your dad.
481	00:29:56	00:29:58	You're strong...
482	00:29:58	00:30:00	like him. You have no idea.
483	00:30:01	00:30:03	I am not going to make it easy.
484	00:30:06	00:30:08	Light's green. Go.
485	00:30:16	00:30:16	Hey.
486	00:30:16	00:30:18	I'm so sorry.
487	00:30:18	00:30:20	You heard about Maya.
488	00:30:20	00:30:20	I did.
489	00:30:21	00:30:24	Well, you were there yourself.
490	00:30:24	00:30:32	And I had a dad who held himself responsible for a decision that was just as much mine as it was his.
491	00:30:32	00:30:34	Doesn't make it any easier.
492	00:30:34	00:30:34	I know.
493	00:30:35	00:30:37	Look, we're gonna get her back.
494	00:30:37	00:30:40	We're gonna find her just like you guys found me.
495	00:30:40	00:30:43	Yeah. Yes, we are.
496	00:30:43	00:30:45	Greg ran the, uh...
497	00:30:45	00:30:54	tread patterns and the, uh... the paint chip from where Shaw switched cars, and it came back to a 2014 red Chevy Impala, which is like a needle in a haystack around here.
498	00:30:54	00:30:56	There are hundreds of them in Nevada.
499	00:30:56	00:31:01	What about you? You're-you're running the-the bugs from the bodies, right, to track down the killer's movement? Yeah.
500	00:31:01	00:31:08	We know that the bodies were moved at least a few times from the crime scene to The Mizu, where they were harvested to make the killer's strings.
501	00:31:08	00:31:11	And then Rebecca Lowell's house where you found them.
502	00:31:11	00:31:16	But given the condition of the larvae on the bodies, it looks like they were frozen and unfrozen more than that.
503	00:31:16	00:31:19	So there might be some other place they were kept.
504	00:31:19	00:31:20	Exactly.
505	00:31:20	00:31:30	Unfortunately, the species of blowfly that I found on the bodies is far too common to zero in on any specific location, but I'm hoping...
506	00:31:30	00:31:32	that these guys are different.
507	00:31:32	00:31:35	Scolytus ventralis, the fir engraver beetle.
508	00:31:35	00:31:43	Yeah. Most common in northern Nevada, but I'm checking with the Bureau of Land Management to see if they've had any infestations closer to Vegas.
509	00:31:44	00:31:46	It could be where Shaw's taking Maya.
510	00:31:46	00:31:49	Well, that's where the... the hope part comes in.
511	00:31:50	00:31:53	I got a response from the Bureau.
512	00:31:53	00:31:59	In the last six months, there have been reports of fir engraver beetle colonies threatening trees along Bighorn Ridge.
513	00:31:59	00:32:01	That's right here.
514	00:32:01	00:32:03	That's a big area.
515	00:32:03	00:32:08	There are only a certain amount of roads in there, so they have to pass by a traffic camera at some point, right? Right.
516	00:32:08	00:32:10	Good work. Thanks.
517	00:32:45	00:32:46	D.B., I need to talk to you.
518	00:32:46	00:32:48	I know why Shaw's doing what he's doing.
519	00:32:48	00:32:53	Tell you the truth, I don't really care, and I need to get to PD. I need you to hear this.
520	00:32:53	00:32:55	The violin. The story about the girl at the recital.
521	00:32:55	00:32:58	That was not Shaw talking about one of his victims.
522	00:32:58	00:32:59	He was talking about his daughter.
523	00:32:59	00:33:04	I should've realized it right away. The violin-- it-it wasn't full size, it's a kid's instrument, and-and...
524	00:33:04	00:33:05	All right, slow down, slow down.
525	00:33:07	00:33:09	I ran the DNA on the violin.
526	00:33:09	00:33:11	It's female.
527	00:33:11	00:33:18	It's a familial match to the dead woman that we found in the bed, Rebecca Lowell's sister, and to Shaw.
528	00:33:18	00:33:20	D.B., he had a daughter.
529	00:33:20	00:33:23	You sure about this? Yes, and it all makes sense now.
530	00:33:23	00:33:30	He was protecting the escort ring run by Rebecca Lowell, and in her records it says that her sister was one of the escorts.
531	00:33:30	00:33:33	So Shaw was involved with the sister and had a kid.
532	00:33:33	00:33:35	Yeah, and I confirmed the birth records.
533	00:33:35	00:33:36	Amy Lowell was born 2001.
534	00:33:36	00:33:39	And I don't think I'm the only one who's figured this out.
535	00:33:39	00:33:42	Winthrop. He is exploiting Shaw's one weakness.
536	00:33:42	00:33:51	And based on the evidence that I found in that house, I think that Winthrop murdered the mother and abducted the daughter and now he's holding her for one reason and one reason only.
537	00:33:51	00:33:53	To trade.
538	00:33:53	00:33:56	Maya for Amy.
539	00:33:56	00:33:58	My daughter for his.
540	00:34:12	00:34:14	Shut off the engine.
541	00:34:15	00:34:17	Give me the key.
542	00:34:19	00:34:21	Get out.
543	00:34:21	00:34:23	Why are you doing this?
544	00:34:25	00:34:26	Because you don't seem like the type.
545	00:34:26	00:34:28	A killer.
546	00:34:28	00:34:30	A man who preys on women.
547	00:34:32	00:34:34	Let's go.
548	00:34:46	00:34:48	Are they waiting for me?
549	00:34:48	00:34:50	You'll find out soon enough.
550	00:35:01	00:35:03	Maya.
551	00:35:03	00:35:04	Welcome.
552	00:35:05	00:35:07	My brother was right.
553	00:35:08	00:35:10	You're even more beautiful in person.
554	00:35:11	00:35:12	I told you so.
555	00:35:15	00:35:17	Four years in prison.
556	00:35:17	00:35:19	It was worth every day just for this moment.
557	00:35:22	00:35:23	You were right, brother.
558	00:35:24	00:35:26	Dreams really do come true.
559	00:35:34	00:35:36	We had a deal. Where's my daughter?
560	00:35:36	00:35:39	She's here. And you'll have her.
561	00:35:39	00:35:41	Just as soon as you slide that gun over here.
562	00:35:41	00:35:44	We wouldn't want any surprises, would we? I'm sure you can understand.
563	00:35:44	00:35:47	My brother and I don't have a lot of trust in cops.
564	00:35:47	00:35:48	Even dirty ones.
565	00:35:49	00:35:51	Well, I don't trust murderers.
566	00:35:51	00:35:52	I want to see Amy.
567	00:35:56	00:35:58	Just got this from the Northeast Division.
568	00:35:58	00:36:00	That's Shaw's car traveling east on Sunrise Highway.
569	00:36:00	00:36:04	6 That's 20 minutes ago.
570	00:36:04	00:36:06	Yeah, if Shaw's meeting with Winthrop, Winthrop's M.O.
571	00:36:06	00:36:10	says the location will be an industrial area or a warehouse district.
572	00:36:10	00:36:12	Right. Someplace isolated, away from prying eyes.
573	00:36:12	00:36:14	Pull up the map of Bighorn Ridge.
574	00:36:14	00:36:16	They're flooding this area with patrol units.
575	00:36:16	00:36:18	We've also scrambled air support.
576	00:36:18	00:36:21	We got eyes in the sky. That's still a hell of lot of real estate. Yes, it is.
577	00:36:21	00:36:23	But we're getting closer.
578	00:36:23	00:36:24	Control, this is Air-Seven.
579	00:36:24	00:36:26	Just identified the suspect vehicle.
580	00:36:26	00:36:31	Red Chevy Impala, license number Adam-Tom-David-Charlie 425.
581	00:36:31	00:36:33	What's your location, Air-Seven?
582	00:36:33	00:36:35	1500 block of Sunrise Highway.
583	00:36:35	00:36:36	Looks like some kind of warehouse.
584	00:36:36	00:36:37	Come on, let's go. Yeah.
585	00:36:41	00:36:43	Amy. Dad.
586	00:36:43	00:36:45	Ah, ah, ah, not so fast.
587	00:36:45	00:36:48	There'll be plenty of time for hugs and kisses later.
588	00:36:49	00:36:50	The gun.
589	00:36:50	00:36:53	You all right, sweetheart?
590	00:37:02	00:37:05	I want to get out of here. Where's my mom?
591	00:37:05	00:37:06	It's gonna be all right.
592	00:37:06	00:37:08	Are you all right? Yeah.
593	00:37:09	00:37:10	So sweet.
594	00:37:10	00:37:13	Nothing like family, right, Jared?
595	00:37:13	00:37:14	When do I get what's coming to me?
596	00:37:14	00:37:16	Patience, brother.
597	00:37:16	00:37:18	You know we can't have any loose ends.
598	00:37:20	00:37:22	I should've figured you'd do this.
599	00:37:25	00:37:29	You should've figured a dirty cop would have a throwaway. Run.
600	00:38:12	00:38:15	You think you're smarter than me?
601	00:38:22	00:38:24	You've taken from me the only family I've ever had.
602	00:38:24	00:38:26	The only real family.
603	00:38:26	00:38:28	The only real love in my life.
604	00:38:28	00:38:31	(soft grunting) I saw how you looked at your little girl.
605	00:38:31	00:38:33	I know how much she means to you.
606	00:38:33	00:38:36	She's not gonna get very far, 'cause I'm gonna find her.
607	00:38:36	00:38:43	And just so you know, when I do, I'm gonna do things to her you can't even imagine.
608	00:38:54	00:38:56	Don't move.
609	00:38:56	00:38:57	I'll get help.
610	00:39:05	00:39:08	Maya, you all right? Yeah, I'm okay.
611	00:39:08	00:39:10	Where are they? Inside. Shaw's wounded.
612	00:39:10	00:39:12	And Winthrop and Briscoe are dead, I think.
613	00:39:12	00:39:13	Let's roll, boys.
614	00:39:19	00:39:20	Check the back.
615	00:39:28	00:39:29	Briscoe's dead.
616	00:39:29	00:39:32	I got a pulse, but it's faint.
617	00:39:32	00:39:36	Charlie-04-Stokes. I need immediate medical at my location.
618	00:39:36	00:39:37	Maya said that Winthrop's dead.
619	00:39:37	00:39:39	But where the hell is he?
620	00:39:49	00:39:52	Hey. Hey.
621	00:39:53	00:39:54	You must be Amy, yeah?
622	00:39:54	00:39:56	I'm Detective Crawford.
623	00:39:56	00:39:58	We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
624	00:39:58	00:40:00	Dad.
625	00:40:01	00:40:03	Hey.
626	00:40:03	00:40:05	You were so brave.
627	00:40:05	00:40:06	Learned from the best.
628	00:40:09	00:40:10	I was afraid...
629	00:40:11	00:40:14	I know. I know. Me, too.
630	00:40:27	00:40:29	Hey.
631	00:40:29	00:40:31	Hi.
632	00:40:31	00:40:32	How are you doing?
633	00:40:34	00:40:36	I've... been better.
634	00:40:36	00:40:38	How's Amy doing?
635	00:40:38	00:40:40	She's safe.
636	00:40:40	00:40:43	She's with Child Protective Services now.
637	00:40:43	00:40:45	They're not gonna let me see her, are they?
638	00:40:48	00:40:49	Well, that's probably just the same.
639	00:40:49	00:40:52	I was never a very good father to her anyway.
640	00:40:52	00:41:00	Just... some guy who showed up from time to time, took her to the park, got her some ice cream, then I was gone again.
641	00:41:03	00:41:06	I just wish you would've come to me before all this happened.
642	00:41:06	00:41:08	Maybe I could've helped.
643	00:41:08	00:41:09	I should've.
644	00:41:09	00:41:10	Yeah.
645	00:41:13	00:41:15	There's something you can do for me now.
646	00:41:15	00:41:20	Amy's got a grandmother, lives in Texas. She's a good woman.
647	00:41:20	00:41:24	I just can't bear to see her get lost in the system.
648	00:41:24	00:41:26	I'll make sure she doesn't.
649	00:41:28	00:41:30	You should just focus on getting better.
650	00:41:31	00:41:33	That's when the trouble starts, right?
651	00:41:33	00:41:36	When I get out of here?
652	00:41:46	00:41:47	I talked to Greg.
653	00:41:47	00:41:50	He and Nick are still processing the scene.
654	00:41:50	00:41:55	They found a blood trail leading from the building to a drainage tunnel, which led to a wash.
655	00:41:55	00:41:56	But no Winthrop?
656	00:41:56	00:41:57	No.
657	00:42:00	00:42:02	All these women.
658	00:42:05	00:42:07	Maya was almost one of them.
659	00:42:08	00:42:09	But she wasn't.
660	00:42:11	00:42:13	You came close, D.B.
661	00:42:13	00:42:15	The greater good.
662	00:42:15	00:42:18	Briscoe's dead, and Winthrop's on the run, a fugitive.
663	00:42:18	00:42:20	You can plaster his face everywhere, freeze his accounts.
664	00:42:21	00:42:23	You're in the driver's seat.
665	00:42:24	00:42:26	Why doesn't it feel like that?
666	00:42:28	00:42:29	No.
667	00:42:29	00:42:31	No, this guy's a predator.
668	00:42:31	00:42:33	He's an animal.
669	00:42:33	00:42:35	You know what they say.
670	00:42:35	00:42:36	Animals are most dangerous when they're cornered.
