0,00:00:10,00:00:13,Baked Brie and raspberry preserves.
1,00:00:13,00:00:15,It's a delight for the eye and the palate.
2,00:00:15,00:00:17,(all laugh)
3,00:00:17,00:00:19,"Well, my wife doesn't just shine onstage. Oh..."
4,00:00:19,00:00:21,"I told you, the best restaurants in L.A."
5,00:00:21,00:00:22,couldn't hold a candle to Gloria.
6,00:00:22,00:00:24,"Oh, Phil."
7,00:00:24,00:00:25,He has a much higher opinion of my cooking than I do.
8,00:00:25,00:00:27,(laughs)
9,00:00:27,00:00:30,"No, it really, it's so, so sweet of you guys to invite us over."
10,00:00:30,00:00:33,"Since Will and I moved to town, we've..."
11,00:00:33,00:00:35,had a hard time meeting people.
12,00:00:35,00:00:36,"Well, you just haven't met the right ones."
13,00:00:36,00:00:38,I'll say. (laughs)
14,00:00:38,00:00:39,(all laughing)
15,00:00:40,00:00:43,Another drink-- you have to allow a guest to do something.
16,00:00:43,00:00:45,"Oh, hell, it's not a school night, huh?"
17,00:00:45,00:00:47,Oh... I don't have to drive.
18,00:00:47,00:00:49,(Gloria laughs)
19,00:00:49,00:00:50,GLORIA: Thank you. PHIL: Thanks.
20,00:00:53,00:00:55,(conversing quietly)
21,00:01:09,00:01:11,(low murmurs)
22,00:01:16,00:01:18,"Oh, I must..."
23,00:01:18,00:01:19,I might have to skip the wine at dinner.
24,00:01:19,00:01:21,I mean...
25,00:01:21,00:01:23,(laughs softly)
26,00:01:23,00:01:25,"Oh, that's a beautiful ring."
27,00:01:25,00:01:27,Thank you. (laughs)
28,00:01:27,00:01:28,Phil has great taste.
29,00:01:28,00:01:32,"Tell me, Gloria, how did you meet your husband?"
30,00:01:32,00:01:35,"Oh, God, it's one of those crazy stories. Um..."
31,00:01:35,00:01:43,"blind date, and somewhere midway through the evening, Phil and I realized that we weren't the ones the host was trying to set up. (laughs)"
32,00:01:43,00:01:44,I meant Ray.
33,00:01:44,00:01:46,How did you meet Ray?
34,00:01:49,00:01:51,Who... who the hell are you?
35,00:01:51,00:01:52,(Gloria whimpers)
36,00:01:52,00:01:54,(Phil mutters)
37,00:01:54,00:01:56,Phil!
38,00:01:58,00:02:00,(gasps)
39,00:02:00,00:02:02,(crickets chirping)
40,00:02:40,00:02:43,(no audio)
41,00:02:43,00:02:45,(phone ringing)
42,00:02:50,00:02:51,Langston.
43,00:02:51,00:02:53,WILLOWS (over phone): Ray.
44,00:02:53,00:02:55,Cops found a body. John Doe.
45,00:02:55,00:02:57,Haskell?
46,00:02:57,00:02:59,Looks like his work. They're holding the crime scene.
47,00:02:59,00:03:00,Where?
48,00:03:00,00:03:01,L.A.
49,00:03:56,00:03:57,WILLOWS: Detective Sosa?
50,00:03:59,00:04:00,Who's asking?
51,00:04:01,00:04:03,Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
52,00:04:03,00:04:05,This is Ray Langston.
53,00:04:05,00:04:07,Thank you for calling us.
54,00:04:07,00:04:09,I didn't call you-- S.I.D. did.
55,00:04:09,00:04:11,"Ask me, you people just wasted a trip."
56,00:04:11,00:04:13,(siren wailing nearby)
57,00:04:13,00:04:15,"SOSA: Hey, Brody!"
58,00:04:16,00:04:18,Vegas is here.
59,00:04:18,00:04:21,Willows. Langston. Enjoy.
60,00:04:21,00:04:23,Welcome to L.A.
61,00:04:23,00:04:26,Another hour and I'd had to get some bread.
62,00:04:26,00:04:28,Do you always eat at your crime scenes?
63,00:04:28,00:04:29,Always keep some in my kit.
64,00:04:29,00:04:31,Especially if I know I'm going to be sharing.
65,00:04:32,00:04:34,They do like peanut butter.
66,00:04:34,00:04:36,And they really loved him.
67,00:04:38,00:04:41,"Sorry, buddy, you're evidence."
68,00:04:41,00:04:44,Excuse me.
69,00:04:46,00:04:47,LANGSTON: Significant animal predation.
70,00:04:47,00:04:48,BRODY: Little guy was hungry.
71,00:04:48,00:04:50,T.O.D.?
72,00:04:50,00:04:51,48 to 72 hours ago.
73,00:04:51,00:04:53,Here.
74,00:04:55,00:04:59,Looks like 12 sharp-force injuries.
75,00:04:59,00:05:00,All postmortem.
76,00:05:00,00:05:02,BRODY: We got word to be on the lookout for Nate Haskell.
77,00:05:02,00:05:03,That's why I called you guys.
78,00:05:03,00:05:05,I went over Sosa's head.
79,00:05:05,00:05:07,Please tell me I'm not going to lose mine.
80,00:05:07,00:05:10,"Well, the last DJK murder victim had ten postmortem stab wounds."
81,00:05:10,00:05:12,"If it's Haskell, he skipped ahead."
82,00:05:12,00:05:16,"Nah, Haskell considers me to be his 11th victim, even though he didn't get to stick me 11 times."
83,00:05:16,00:05:20,"Well, thanks for holding the crime scene, Brody."
84,00:05:20,00:05:21,We're going to need to turn him.
85,00:05:27,00:05:29,"Excuse me, you Ray? Yes. And you are?"
86,00:05:29,00:05:31,I'm the guy who's going to marry your wife.
87,00:05:31,00:05:32,(Gloria laughs)
88,00:05:44,00:05:46,All clear.
89,00:05:50,00:05:52,(indistinct radio transmission)
90,00:05:53,00:05:56,I'll call in S.I.D.
91,00:05:58,00:06:01,"Ray, I-I don't think that you should be here."
92,00:06:13,00:06:15,"Let's see, uh..."
93,00:06:15,00:06:16,I can have a car take you downtown.
94,00:06:16,00:06:18,Hello! That's evidence!
95,00:06:18,00:06:19,"WILLOWS: Ray, what are you doing?"
96,00:06:41,00:06:45,SANDERS: Condo security company gave us access to the surveillance files.
97,00:06:45,00:06:48,The time stamp here is 8:37.
98,00:06:48,00:06:51,Metadata says it's from three nights ago.
99,00:06:51,00:06:57,"I got Gloria and Phil coming home, but somebody else leaving... intheircar."
100,00:06:57,00:07:00,"WILLOWS: Well, there's no sign of Gloria and Phil."
101,00:07:00,00:07:03,My vote's for the trunk.
102,00:07:03,00:07:05,"Greg, can you get us a better look?"
103,00:07:09,00:07:10,Whoa.
104,00:07:10,00:07:12,WILLOWS: Tina Vincent.
105,00:07:12,00:07:15,Who? Latest bride of Haskell.
106,00:07:15,00:07:17,WILLOWS: Is there a passenger?
107,00:07:17,00:07:19,This angle's not helping us.
108,00:07:19,00:07:20,Maybe this will.
109,00:07:22,00:07:25,See if I can lose the fun house.
110,00:07:27,00:07:30,It's him. It's Haskell.
111,00:07:30,00:07:33,I thought you said he changed his face?
112,00:07:33,00:07:34,We were wrong.
113,00:07:34,00:07:37,"Guess I was wrong about that wasted trip, huh?"
114,00:07:37,00:07:40,"WILLOWS: Greg, LAPD has given us their full cooperation."
115,00:07:40,00:07:41,Get traffic cam footage from three nights ago.
116,00:07:41,00:07:43,See if you can follow the car.
117,00:07:43,00:07:44,Copy that.
118,00:07:44,00:07:46,You have my cooperation.
119,00:07:46,00:07:49,"Don't forget, it's still my city."
120,00:07:49,00:07:51,(helicopter blades whirring nearby)
121,00:07:56,00:07:58,"He gained their trust, Catherine. He was here."
122,00:08:01,00:08:02,"We'll find him, Ray."
123,00:08:02,00:08:04,And we'll find Gloria.
124,00:08:04,00:08:07,"""Three days and three nights of Heaven on Earth."
125,00:08:07,00:08:10,"""And then..."
126,00:08:10,00:08:14,"just Heaven."" Haskell's words."
127,00:08:14,00:08:16,It's what he does with his victims.
128,00:08:16,00:08:18,It's already been 72 hours.
129,00:08:18,00:08:20,That means she's already gone.
130,00:08:20,00:08:23,We'll see what the evidence says.
131,00:08:24,00:08:27,"I don't think I can do this, boss."
132,00:08:27,00:08:29,I'll call Sara.
133,00:08:29,00:08:31,I'll have a car take you back to the airport.
134,00:08:31,00:08:34,Thanks.
135,00:08:45,00:08:49,LANGSTON: Let's talk about something you enjoyed-- your first kill.
136,00:08:49,00:08:54,"You never forget your first, but I think that's a little intimate for this stage of our relationship."
137,00:08:58,00:09:01,LANGSTON: Tell us your definition of fun.
138,00:09:01,00:09:04,Fun is taking something away from somebody.
139,00:09:05,00:09:08,"HASKELL: Oh, Ray..."
140,00:09:08,00:09:10,there is a moral to this story.
141,00:09:10,00:09:13,"Officer, would you mind pulling up over here?"
142,00:09:13,00:09:15,Sir? There's a bar over here.
143,00:09:15,00:09:17,I want to have a drink before I get on the plane.
144,00:09:17,00:09:18,Flight's in a half-hour.
145,00:09:18,00:09:20,There's a flight to Vegas every hour.
146,00:09:20,00:09:21,I'll take the next one.
147,00:09:22,00:09:24,"Look, you're welcome to join me."
148,00:09:24,00:09:28,I'm on duty... sir. (sighs)
149,00:09:28,00:09:29,I'll wait for you out front.
150,00:09:42,00:09:44,(phone line ringing)
151,00:09:45,00:09:47,(phone beeps)
152,00:09:47,00:09:49,"LANGSTON: Hey, it's Ray."
153,00:09:49,00:09:52,I know you're working.
154,00:09:52,00:09:55,"I didn't expect you to answer, but, uh..."
155,00:09:55,00:09:58,you're the only one I can talk to.
156,00:09:58,00:10:03,The only person who I think will truly understand this.
157,00:10:03,00:10:08,"At least, I hope you'll understand when I've done what I have to do."
158,00:10:08,00:10:12,"You know, we all make choices..."
159,00:10:12,00:10:14,live with the consequences.
160,00:10:16,00:10:18,The only person I have ever loved...
161,00:10:18,00:10:20,(door opens) is dead.
162,00:10:24,00:10:26,(continues over recording): And now...
163,00:10:26,00:10:29,there's only one thing left for me to do.
164,00:10:30,00:10:31,"Good-bye, Al."
165,00:10:39,00:10:42,There's residue on the glass.
166,00:10:42,00:10:43,They were drugged.
167,00:10:43,00:10:46,"If Haskell's up to his old tricks, it's probably Salvia divinorum."
168,00:10:46,00:10:49,I'll have the L.A. lab run it.
169,00:10:49,00:10:52,Did you meet S.I.D. Brody? Yeah.
170,00:10:52,00:10:54,She seems familiar.
171,00:10:54,00:10:56,"So, I found blood in the shower."
172,00:10:56,00:10:57,Looks like Haskell cleaned up.
173,00:10:57,00:11:00,I have yet to process his gift.
174,00:11:00,00:11:03,I'll give S.I.D. a hand. Okay.
175,00:11:03,00:11:05,(distant siren wailing)
176,00:11:11,00:11:13,BRODY: Does this look like high-velocity blood spatter to you?
177,00:11:13,00:11:15,"SIDLE: Yes, it does."
178,00:11:15,00:11:20,Coroner's report said Phil Baker was strangled with a ligature-- probably his own tie.
179,00:11:20,00:11:27,"Blunt-force trauma to the head, 12 postmortem stab wounds-- I don't see all that causing this. SIDLE: Gunshots maybe?"
180,00:11:27,00:11:30,Tina Vincent popped two people in Vegas.
181,00:11:30,00:11:33,I'm hoping that we don't have to add Gloria to the list.
182,00:11:33,00:11:36,(insect buzzing) You hear that?
183,00:11:36,00:11:37,What?
184,00:11:37,00:11:38,(buzzing continues)
185,00:11:43,00:11:46,Megaselia scalaris.
186,00:11:46,00:11:49,Little buggers corrupted our crime scene.
187,00:11:49,00:11:51,(insects buzzing)
188,00:11:53,00:11:55,BRODY: No gunshot.
189,00:11:55,00:11:57,They painted the wall. So...
190,00:11:57,00:12:01,"Haskell's M.O.: kill the man, dump the body, take the woman alive."
191,00:12:01,00:12:04,Hmm.
192,00:12:11,00:12:14,Oh... blood and tissue.
193,00:12:15,00:12:17,"Postmortem stab wounds, anyone?"
194,00:12:17,00:12:20,The flies weren't the only artists in this room.
195,00:12:20,00:12:24,"Phil Baker was struck in the head, then strangled."
196,00:12:24,00:12:25,Stabbed postmortem.
197,00:12:25,00:12:30,"The blood was the paint, the body the brush."
198,00:12:30,00:12:33,"Dragged him around, created a Picasso."
199,00:12:33,00:12:35,You're thinking that all this blood came from just one source.
200,00:12:37,00:12:40,Haskell wanted Langston to feel the horror of what happened in this room.
201,00:12:40,00:12:42,He wanted to get inside his head.
202,00:12:44,00:12:46,Hey.
203,00:12:46,00:12:49,Your boy Sanders helped us track down the Bakers' car.
204,00:12:49,00:12:52,"Dumped in K-Town, blood in the trunk."
205,00:12:52,00:12:53,But no Gloria?
206,00:12:53,00:12:55,Way ahead of you.
207,00:12:55,00:12:58,I got guys searching the park and all around the observatory.
208,00:12:58,00:13:00,But you may need a search party yourself.
209,00:13:00,00:13:03,Ray Langston ditched his escort to the airport.
210,00:13:03,00:13:06,"And this morning's little ""bull in a china shop"" act says he's dangerous."
211,00:13:08,00:13:10,Tell me he's not armed.
212,00:13:16,00:13:20,"I don't want any serial numbers. Hey, I run a respectable joint here."
213,00:13:20,00:13:23,Is that respectable enough for you?
214,00:13:26,00:13:28,I also need a laptop.
215,00:13:28,00:13:30,Gates or Jobs?
216,00:13:31,00:13:34,Let me take a look in the back.
217,00:13:55,00:13:57,I'm throwing in a holster for free.
218,00:14:01,00:14:03,PAWNBROKER: That do it for you?
219,00:14:03,00:14:05,How much for the laptop?
220,00:14:05,00:14:06,Five more bills.
221,00:14:08,00:14:10,(long sigh)
222,00:14:12,00:14:13,Sold.
223,00:14:13,00:14:14,No negotiating?
224,00:14:14,00:14:16,"Well, I like that."
225,00:14:16,00:14:20,"Hey, Willoughby Observatory-- it's the best view in town."
226,00:14:22,00:14:24,"Nicky, I need you in L.A."
227,00:14:24,00:14:26,I can't find Ray. He's not answering his phone.
228,00:14:26,00:14:27,"Yeah, I know. I'm worried."
229,00:14:27,00:14:30,He called the doc. He didn't sound real good.
230,00:14:30,00:14:31,It sounds like he's in a dark place.
231,00:14:31,00:14:33,"Well, he's here somewhere."
232,00:14:33,00:14:34,We got to find him.
233,00:14:34,00:14:37,All right. I'm on my way. I'll find his ass.
234,00:14:37,00:14:40,We opened up Gloria's social network page.
235,00:14:40,00:14:42,Found she'd been tagged in a friend's photo.
236,00:14:42,00:14:45,SIDLE: We now know where Gloria and Phil met Haskell and Tina.
237,00:14:45,00:14:47,It was a benefit concert four nights ago.
238,00:14:47,00:14:49,Gloria was the main attraction.
239,00:14:49,00:14:53,Gloria and Phil invited Haskell and Tina for drinks the next night.
240,00:14:53,00:14:57,"""Willoughby J. Willoughby."" Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?"
241,00:14:57,00:14:58,"Another of Haskell's riddles, maybe?"
242,00:14:58,00:15:05,"Well, the postcard that was left at the crime scene had a picture of Willoughby Canyon and Observatory on it."
243,00:15:05,00:15:07,So what's he trying to say? I don't know.
244,00:15:07,00:15:11,Maybe it has something to do with this guy Willoughby or some kind of L.A. lore or history.
245,00:15:14,00:15:15,"Oh, don't look at me."
246,00:15:15,00:15:18,I... always did better in science.
247,00:15:18,00:15:22,"SIDLE: You know, we do know somebody who's into both."
248,00:15:26,00:15:31,Willoughby J. Willoughby was a wealthy L.A. benefactor who made his fortune in shipping.
249,00:15:31,00:15:35,But the bulk of his profits were thought to have come from money-laundering.
250,00:15:35,00:15:36,Explains the benefactor part.
251,00:15:36,00:15:38,Trying to clean up his act.
252,00:15:38,00:15:39,"Yeah, well, it didn't last."
253,00:15:39,00:15:43,"'Cause in 1943, he shot his wife in the head during an argument."
254,00:15:43,00:15:45,Attack on his wife.
255,00:15:47,00:15:49,I think I'm starting to get the joke.
256,00:15:49,00:15:56,"The postcard, the ring, ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo."" Haskell wanted Ray to come out and play."
257,00:15:56,00:15:59,So... some kind of an invitation.
258,00:15:59,00:16:02,WILLOWS: Except we're the ones who are gonna crash the party.
259,00:16:02,00:16:06,"Greg, I want to know everything there is to know about Willoughby J. Willoughby."
260,00:16:06,00:16:08,Work your magic.
261,00:16:08,00:16:10,Do my best.
262,00:16:46,00:16:48,(bag drops to ground)
263,00:17:02,00:17:04,(panting quietly)
264,00:17:23,00:17:25,You know why I'm here.
265,00:17:32,00:17:35,(indistinct radio transmissions)
266,00:17:40,00:17:41,Hey.
267,00:17:41,00:17:43,Hey.
268,00:17:43,00:17:46,"I drove straight from the airport to S.I.D., checked in."
269,00:17:46,00:17:47,Sara told me you'd be here.
270,00:17:47,00:17:50,"Detective Sosa, this is CSI Nick Stokes."
271,00:17:50,00:17:51,"Hey, man."
272,00:17:51,00:17:54,Wow. Anybody left in Vegas to catch crooks?
273,00:17:54,00:17:56,"Yeah, there's still a couple of us."
274,00:17:56,00:17:57,"So, what's going on here?"
275,00:17:57,00:17:59,Got a call. Shots fired.
276,00:17:59,00:18:02,"Units responded, found a Caucasian female."
277,00:18:03,00:18:05,Who is she?
278,00:18:05,00:18:07,WILLOWS (sighs): Tina Vincent.
279,00:18:07,00:18:10,Somebody worked her over pretty good.
280,00:18:10,00:18:14,"Looks like she might've gotten a couple of licks in, though."
281,00:18:16,00:18:18,Nine-mil.
282,00:18:18,00:18:25,"One in the leg, one in the head, and a whole lot of ugly in between."
283,00:18:25,00:18:28,I used to work Narco-- whoever did this wanted information.
284,00:18:28,00:18:31,Or he was just a sadistic bastard.
285,00:18:42,00:18:46,"SOSA: Excuse me, what do you two think you're doing?"
286,00:18:47,00:18:48,Gonna process the scene.
287,00:18:48,00:18:52,"Look, I'm all about cooperating, but I'd prefer to have my people handle this."
288,00:18:55,00:18:59,"WILLOWS: Look, Detective Sosa, this is still a DJK case."
289,00:18:59,00:19:01,You find Ray Langston yet?
290,00:19:04,00:19:06,Maybehefoundher.
291,00:19:12,00:19:14,Stokes.
292,00:19:14,00:19:15,"It's Stokes, right?"
293,00:19:15,00:19:17,Yeah.
294,00:19:17,00:19:19,BRODY: At lvpdcsi.com?
295,00:19:19,00:19:21,STOKES: Yeah.
296,00:19:21,00:19:22,(cell phone rings) Forgot something.
297,00:19:26,00:19:27,Thanks.
298,00:19:29,00:19:30,Morgan.
299,00:19:31,00:19:34,I just figured it out-- you're Conrad's daughter.
300,00:19:34,00:19:37,Before the divorce. (laughs)
301,00:19:37,00:19:39,"Last time I saw you, you were just a kid."
302,00:19:39,00:19:41,So you don't go by Ecklie.
303,00:19:41,00:19:42,I took my stepdad's last name.
304,00:19:43,00:19:46,I'll catch you guys later.
305,00:19:48,00:19:50,I like her style.
306,00:19:51,00:19:55,BRODY: I processed Tina Vincent's room.
307,00:19:55,00:20:01,"Prints I lifted place three people there-- Nate Haskell, Tina Vincent..."
308,00:20:01,00:20:04,SOSA: And CSI Raymond Langston.
309,00:20:05,00:20:07,You want to explain that to me?
310,00:20:07,00:20:14,"I can't. I got enough trouble chasing down the bad guys; I don't need to be chasing the good ones, too. Look, we don't know what happened in that room."
311,00:20:14,00:20:20,"Yeah, we do. Someone tortured that girl till they got what they wanted, then they put a bullet through her head."
312,00:20:20,00:20:23,"Now, I'm gonna ask you again: does Ray Langston carry? No."
313,00:20:26,00:20:29,What about blood evidence?
314,00:20:30,00:20:37,"I found blood on the doorknob and on the vic's ring, along with epithelials under her fingernails."
315,00:20:37,00:20:39,Consistent with a struggle.
316,00:20:39,00:20:41,DNA comes back to an unknown African-American male.
317,00:20:41,00:20:46,"You run it against CSI Langston? I would have, but... he wasn't in the system."
318,00:20:46,00:20:48,How is that possible? Man's a CSI.
319,00:20:48,00:20:50,Submission is voluntary. Great.
320,00:20:50,00:20:53,"So if I ever want to kill someone, I'll just transfer to Vegas."
321,00:20:53,00:20:56,Ray's not a murderer. No?
322,00:20:56,00:20:58,He's definitely a suspect.
323,00:21:02,00:21:04,(sighs)
324,00:21:08,00:21:10,(exhales)
325,00:21:18,00:21:20,How did you find me?
326,00:21:20,00:21:21,I'm part hound dog.
327,00:21:21,00:21:29,"I pinged your cell, traced it back to a tower near Dodger Stadium, then checked out all the motels one cut above fleabag."
328,00:21:29,00:21:31,It was really pretty easy.
329,00:21:31,00:21:33,When did you start carrying a gun again?
330,00:21:33,00:21:34,"You need to go home, Nick."
331,00:21:34,00:21:39,You're not taking me back. I'm not here to take you back; I'm here to help you out.
332,00:21:39,00:21:41,Haskell wantsme.
333,00:21:41,00:21:44,All right? He doesn't want you.
334,00:21:44,00:21:45,Raymond...
335,00:21:45,00:21:48,Tina Vincent's dead.
336,00:21:52,00:21:54,"Now, I know you didn't kill her..."
337,00:21:54,00:21:56,but you need to tell me what happened.
338,00:21:57,00:22:00,Haskell wanted me to find her.
339,00:22:02,00:22:03,"(grunts, laughs)"
340,00:22:03,00:22:04,"Where is he, Tina?"
341,00:22:04,00:22:06,You want to hurt me?
342,00:22:06,00:22:10,You're going to tell me what I want to know.
343,00:22:10,00:22:11,(Tina laughing)
344,00:22:11,00:22:14,And did she?
345,00:22:14,00:22:18,All she would said is that Nate wanted me to have that.
346,00:22:18,00:22:21,Said the blood on it was Gloria's.
347,00:22:21,00:22:24,It used every ounce of my strength not to hurt her.
348,00:22:24,00:22:29,"Well, Haskell came back after you left and he put a real good hurting on her for you."
349,00:22:29,00:22:32,"You do realize what he's doing, don't you?"
350,00:22:32,00:22:33,"Yes, yes, he's isolating me."
351,00:22:33,00:22:34,He's making you a fugitive.
352,00:22:34,00:22:37,He's cutting you off from everyone and everything.
353,00:22:37,00:22:42,"And believe me, if it was this easy for me to find you, LAPD won't have a problem."
354,00:22:42,00:22:44,Take a look at this.
355,00:22:46,00:22:49,I found this at Tina Vincent's crime scene.
356,00:22:49,00:22:51,"""You never forget your first."" Same ticket, same message."
357,00:22:51,00:22:53,What is he saying?
358,00:22:53,00:22:56,This sick bastard is leaving us a bread crumb trail.
359,00:22:56,00:22:57,All we have to do is figure out where it leads.
360,00:22:57,00:23:00,"I can't exactly call the lab now, can I?"
361,00:23:00,00:23:02,I can.
362,00:23:08,00:23:09,"STOKES (over phone): How we doing, Greg?"
363,00:23:09,00:23:11,(hushed): Ask him about Langston.
364,00:23:11,00:23:12,I found the manufacturer of the tickets.
365,00:23:12,00:23:15,(hushed): Ask him about Langston.
366,00:23:15,00:23:16,Running the numbers through the company's database right now.
367,00:23:16,00:23:18,Will you ask him? Shut up.
368,00:23:18,00:23:19,STOKES: What?
369,00:23:19,00:23:20,"Um, sorry. I wasn't talking to you."
370,00:23:20,00:23:22,"Uh, Nick, yeah, it's me."
371,00:23:22,00:23:33,"Um, I heard the news, and, uh, while I can empathize with Ray, I feel I must express my concern that his Dirty Harry style antics of late can only reflect badly on the team."
372,00:23:33,00:23:34,"Hodges, put Greg back on the phone."
373,00:23:34,00:23:36,"Yeah, will do."
374,00:23:36,00:23:39,"Just tell me, is there any news from Ray?"
375,00:23:39,00:23:41,"But when I find him, you'll be the first to know."
376,00:23:41,00:23:43,Give me that.
377,00:23:43,00:23:44,"All right, I think I got something."
378,00:23:44,00:23:48,"According to this, the tickets were delivered to L.A."
379,00:23:48,00:23:51,Part of a shipment to the Santa Monica Pier.
380,00:23:52,00:23:54,(music playing in distance)
381,00:24:00,00:24:03,The carousel.
382,00:24:03,00:24:07,"""You never forget your first."" What are you talking about?"
383,00:24:07,00:24:09,My first date with Gloria was on a carousel in Baltimore.
384,00:24:09,00:24:10,How would Haskell know something like that?
385,00:24:13,00:24:15,We may be walking into something here.
386,00:24:16,00:24:18,"You got my back, right?"
387,00:24:18,00:24:19,Always.
388,00:24:26,00:24:28,(door closes)
389,00:24:43,00:24:44,(carousel music begins playing)
390,00:25:05,00:25:08,"This isn't our first date, Ray."
391,00:25:10,00:25:12,It's just our first without a chaperone.
392,00:25:17,00:25:18,STOKES: Get your hands up.
393,00:25:20,00:25:23,Ahh... Ray!
394,00:25:23,00:25:25,No fair.
395,00:25:25,00:25:27,"You're under arrest, you son of a bitch."
396,00:25:27,00:25:29,Yeah. (two gunshots)
397,00:25:31,00:25:32,STOKES: Where is he?
398,00:25:34,00:25:36,STOKES: I got the other side.
399,00:25:36,00:25:38,"(door opens) Outside, Ray."

408,00:26:27,00:26:27,Drop the gun!
409,00:26:27,00:26:30,"I'm a CSI, in pursuit of a suspect."
410,00:26:30,00:26:32,"Look, I don't care who the hell you are-- drop the gun!"
411,00:26:32,00:26:34,You're making a big mistake. Listen to me!
412,00:26:34,00:26:35,"No, you listen!"
413,00:26:35,00:26:38,"Drop the gun, get on your knees and put your hands behind your head!"
414,00:26:39,00:26:42,"Do it, now!"
415,00:26:45,00:26:46,I'm not getting on my knees.

421,00:27:17,00:27:19,"Listen to him, Ray."
422,00:27:19,00:27:21,(gunshot)
423,00:27:22,00:27:23,"It can't end like this, Ray."
424,00:27:23,00:27:28,"Oh, I know how you feel, Ray, but if you pull that trigger now, you'll kill more than me."
425,00:27:28,00:27:30,"Two people die, Ray!"
426,00:27:33,00:27:34,She's still alive!
427,00:27:34,00:27:36,"Gloria's still alive, Ray!"

430,00:27:42,00:27:44,(passengers screaming happily)
431,00:27:52,00:27:59,"SOSA: Nate Haskell is responsible for the deaths of over 25 people, including four law enforcement officers in Las Vegas."
432,00:27:59,00:28:03,And last night he damn near took the life of one of my men.
433,00:28:03,00:28:05,So how come he didn't take yours?
434,00:28:05,00:28:08,I can't answer that.
435,00:28:09,00:28:10,That's a load of crap.
436,00:28:13,00:28:14,Where'd you get the gun?
437,00:28:14,00:28:17,I took it from an assailant who attempted to mug me in MacArthur Park.
438,00:28:17,00:28:19,My intention was to turn it in.
439,00:28:19,00:28:22,You know something...
440,00:28:22,00:28:25,you're lucky Officer Davies was wearing a vest...
441,00:28:25,00:28:30,and that the slug we took out of it was a match to the bullet that killed Tina Vincent.
442,00:28:30,00:28:33,But you knew where to find her.
443,00:28:33,00:28:35,And you knew where to find Haskell.
444,00:28:38,00:28:43,"Now, I don't care if you're inside his head, or he's inside yours."
445,00:28:43,00:28:44,You know what's going on here.
446,00:28:46,00:28:48,You got a choice.
447,00:28:48,00:28:52,"You talk to me, or I'm putting your ass on a plane back to Vegas myself."
448,00:28:56,00:28:59,Am I being charged with a crime?
449,00:29:20,00:29:22,I'll be the one to get him on the plane.
450,00:29:22,00:29:24,"You know, if it was up to me, I'd send you all home."
451,00:29:24,00:29:32,"But then, I got a problem-- Haskell drops another body and it's my ass in the sling 'cause I'm the moron who sent the Haskell experts back to Vegas."
452,00:29:32,00:29:34,So no free airfare then?
453,00:29:34,00:29:38,How about no more surprises?
454,00:29:51,00:29:53,I'll meet you back at S.I.D.
455,00:29:53,00:29:55,I'll go check in with Morgan.
456,00:29:58,00:29:59,"I told you to find him, Nicky."
457,00:29:59,00:30:01,I did find him. I should've known.
458,00:30:01,00:30:04,"You had to have his back, had to cowboy up on some vigilante mission."
459,00:30:04,00:30:08,"I mean, I get him, but you have no excuse."
460,00:30:08,00:30:10,"So are you sending me home, now, too?"
461,00:30:10,00:30:12,"Oh, I'd like to, but I can't, because I need you here."
462,00:30:12,00:30:14,"And, luckily, LAPD is giving you a second chance."
463,00:30:14,00:30:15,Ray...
464,00:30:15,00:30:18,you're going back to Vegas.
465,00:30:18,00:30:20,Do I have to post a guard at your door?
466,00:30:20,00:30:23,"No, that won't be necessary."
467,00:30:30,00:30:32,We'll get him.
468,00:30:35,00:30:37,"SIDLE: Smooth, polished surface."
469,00:30:37,00:30:38,It looks like beach sand.
470,00:30:38,00:30:40,Recovered from Tina Vincent's room.
471,00:30:40,00:30:43,"Well, that makes sense-- Haskell was at the pier, he spent some time at the beach."
472,00:30:43,00:30:45,Found more than just beach sand.
473,00:30:45,00:30:47,I think he's been spending time somewhere else.
474,00:30:47,00:30:49,Put your nose down that one.
475,00:30:51,00:30:53,"Nesosilicates, garnet."
476,00:30:53,00:30:55,There's chips of paint in the mix.
477,00:30:55,00:30:58,This sand is from construction.
478,00:30:58,00:30:59,"Sandblasting, maybe."
479,00:30:59,00:31:03,"Plenty of that downtown, at least until the economy hit the skids."
480,00:31:03,00:31:05,Maybe Haskell's squatting.
481,00:31:05,00:31:08,Or it's where he left Gloria's body.
482,00:31:11,00:31:14,The rings of a tree will give up its history.
483,00:31:16,00:31:20,"Blast the paint off the side of a building, layers are going to tell you the same story."
484,00:31:22,00:31:24,Time for a little chip and dip.
485,00:31:51,00:31:53,(beeps)
486,00:32:05,00:32:06,(sighs)
487,00:32:07,00:32:09,"ROBBINS: Hey, Ray."
488,00:32:09,00:32:11,Hey.
489,00:32:12,00:32:15,Thanks for coming to get me.
490,00:32:15,00:32:16,"Well, Catherine didn't give me much choice."
491,00:32:16,00:32:18,Yeah. But I would've been here anyway.
492,00:32:20,00:32:21,What's going on?
493,00:32:22,00:32:26,"Haskell could've killed me, he didn't."
494,00:32:26,00:32:28,"Yeah, well, maybe he didn't want to kill you."
495,00:32:28,00:32:32,He just... wants to keep hurting you.
496,00:32:33,00:32:35,Can we go back to the office for a while?
497,00:32:35,00:32:36,"You're on leave, Ray."
498,00:32:36,00:32:38,You think that's a good idea? I don't know.
499,00:32:38,00:32:41,You think it's a good idea for me to just go home and sit in an empty house?
500,00:32:43,00:32:45,Come on.
501,00:32:45,00:32:49,The trace that we thought was sand in Tina Vincent's room turned out to be commercial sandblasting.
502,00:32:49,00:32:50,Found paint chips in the mix.
503,00:32:50,00:32:51,Gave us a profile of the building.
504,00:32:51,00:32:53,"You're thinking if we find the building, we may find Haskell."
505,00:32:53,00:32:55,STOKES: Base layer had traces of concrete.
506,00:32:55,00:32:57,Suggests it's industrial.
507,00:32:57,00:32:59,12 layers?
508,00:32:59,00:33:02,Damn. You figure buildings get a new coat of paint every six to eight years.
509,00:33:02,00:33:03,Place is old.
510,00:33:03,00:33:08,"But the sandblasting suggests it's under renovation, at least at some point recently."
511,00:33:08,00:33:13,"SIDLE: Chemical composition of the paint indicated epoxy formulations-- maintenance paint used in railings, fire doors..."
512,00:33:13,00:33:18,"STOKES: So, what, we're talking about a school, hospital, or government building?"
513,00:33:18,00:33:19,Narrows it down.
514,00:33:19,00:33:23,Let's have LAPD pull building and demolition permits over the last three years.
515,00:33:23,00:33:24,We'll start there.
516,00:33:24,00:33:27,"Nice work, Morgan."
517,00:33:28,00:33:30,"Yeah, thanks."
518,00:33:41,00:33:43,Hey. Hey.
519,00:33:45,00:33:47,Access denied.
520,00:33:47,00:33:51,"Yeah, you're probably thinking virus, but, uh, it's Willows."
521,00:33:51,00:33:53,Catherine pulled my privileges?
522,00:33:53,00:33:57,I'm sure it's just temporary. You're damn right it's only temporary 'cause you're going to give me your passcode right now.
523,00:33:57,00:34:00,"No, I can't do that. Or I'm going to go all Dirty Harry on you."
524,00:34:01,00:34:03,You were listening.
525,00:34:04,00:34:06,I'm going to do this one time.
526,00:34:08,00:34:10,(typing)
527,00:34:14,00:34:16,(typing)
528,00:34:16,00:34:20,Willoughby J. Willoughby.
529,00:34:20,00:34:22,"LANGSTON: ""Born 1895, died 1963."
530,00:34:22,00:34:30,"""Shipping magnate, ""Willoughby donated thousands of acres of land to the city of Los Angeles."" What's going on?"
531,00:34:30,00:34:33,You can be part of the problem or part of the solution.
532,00:34:33,00:34:35,Solution.
533,00:34:36,00:34:38,"Back to Willoughby J. Willoughby, huh?"
534,00:34:38,00:34:42,Thought we left him behind with Tina Vincent at The Penwick. We did.
535,00:34:42,00:34:44,"Not so sure about Haskell, though."
536,00:34:48,00:34:50,"Man shoots his wife in the head, kills her."
537,00:34:50,00:34:53,"I mean, there's got to be... some deeper meaning."
538,00:34:53,00:34:55,He didn't kill her.
539,00:34:55,00:34:58,She survived?
540,00:34:58,00:34:59,Yes.
541,00:34:59,00:35:00,Is that significant?
542,00:35:00,00:35:03,Yes. Tell me more about the crime.
543,00:35:03,00:35:06,SANDERS: LAPD faxed me copies of the old case files.
544,00:35:06,00:35:09,"Apparently, Willoughby was a bigamist."
545,00:35:09,00:35:13,"Willoughby J. Willoughby-- a name so nice, he married twice."
546,00:35:13,00:35:17,Willoughby's second wife Audrey was from Las Vegas.
547,00:35:17,00:35:24,"The night of the shooting, Wife Number One-- Sylvia-- surprised Willoughby and Wife Number Two during a tryst at The Penwick."
548,00:35:24,00:35:27,"One thing led to another, and Willoughby shot Wife Number One."
549,00:35:27,00:35:30,So Wife Number Two witnessed the crime?
550,00:35:30,00:35:34,"Along with her seven-year-old son, who was staying in the adjoining room."
551,00:35:34,00:35:37,HODGES: And that seven-year-old boy is Nate Haskell.
552,00:35:38,00:35:40,If Nate Haskell were 75 years old.
553,00:35:40,00:35:42,What was the boy's name?
554,00:35:42,00:35:44,Arvin.
555,00:35:44,00:35:46,Wife Number One survives.
556,00:35:47,00:35:50,Do we know what happened to Wife Number Two?
557,00:35:50,00:35:59,"According to court records, uh, Audrey Willoughby, two years following the shooting, was committed to a psychiatric facility-- St. Collette's Hospital in L.A."
558,00:35:59,00:36:06,"The boy was placed into the custody of his uncle, and that's pretty much where the trail ends. Hmm."
559,00:36:06,00:36:10,Wife died the same year the hospital closed in the mid-1980s.
560,00:36:10,00:36:12,Is there a problem?
561,00:36:12,00:36:18,"Catherine said that Haskell might be hiding out in an industrial building, maybe a hospital."
562,00:36:20,00:36:23,One from around the same era...
563,00:36:24,00:36:27,...undergoing renovations.
564,00:36:30,00:36:33,"I've, uh, got to call Catherine."
565,00:36:50,00:36:52,David. Yeah.
566,00:36:52,00:36:53,Would you mind getting us some coffee?
567,00:36:53,00:36:54,Absolutely.
568,00:36:54,00:36:56,Thank you.
569,00:36:59,00:37:01,(sighs)
570,00:37:16,00:37:22,"STOKES: Mr. Thorpe, do you know where Tina and this squirrelly guy are shacking up?"
571,00:37:22,00:37:24,The old house across the road.
572,00:38:05,00:38:07,HASKELL: She's still alive!
573,00:38:07,00:38:09,"Gloria's still alive, Ray!"
574,00:38:10,00:38:13,"Hello, Nate."
575,00:38:13,00:38:19,"DISPATCHER: Show Detective Sosa responding code three to St. Collette's Hospital with Las Vegas CSI, requesting additional backup."

582,00:40:58,00:40:59,Mr. Thorpe.
583,00:40:59,00:41:00,Help me.
584,00:41:04,00:41:05,Please.
585,00:41:05,00:41:07,"Mr. Thorpe, where's your son?"
586,00:41:07,00:41:09,Warner...
587,00:41:09,00:41:10,Where is he?
588,00:41:10,00:41:11,Please...
589,00:41:11,00:41:13,help.
590,00:41:22,00:41:25,"Charlie-07, Langston."
591,00:41:25,00:41:29,Request immediate backup and paramedics to my location-- the old Thorpe farm.
592,00:41:29,00:41:30,Code three.
593,00:41:30,00:41:32,(chain rattling)
594,00:41:32,00:41:35,GLORIA (weakly): Ray?
595,00:41:39,00:41:42,Ray.
596,00:41:42,00:41:44,(moans quietly)
597,00:41:46,00:41:48,Gloria.
598,00:41:53,00:41:55,I'm gonna get you out of here.
599,00:42:18,00:42:21,(door creaking)
600,00:42:22,00:42:24,"Welcome home, Ray."
601,00:42:29,00:42:31,Welcome home.
