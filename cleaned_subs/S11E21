0	00:00:10	00:00:13	Baked Brie and raspberry preserves.
1	00:00:13	00:00:15	It's a delight for the eye and the palate.
2	00:00:17	00:00:19	Well, my wife doesn't just shine onstage. Oh...
3	00:00:19	00:00:21	I told you, the best restaurants in L.A.
4	00:00:21	00:00:22	couldn't hold a candle to Gloria.
5	00:00:22	00:00:24	Oh, Phil.
6	00:00:24	00:00:25	He has a much higher opinion of my cooking than I do.
7	00:00:27	00:00:30	No, it really, it's so, so sweet of you guys to invite us over.
8	00:00:30	00:00:33	Since Will and I moved to town, we've...
9	00:00:33	00:00:35	had a hard time meeting people.
10	00:00:35	00:00:36	Well, you just haven't met the right ones.
11	00:00:36	00:00:38	I'll say. (laughs)
12	00:00:40	00:00:43	Another drink-- you have to allow a guest to do something.
13	00:00:43	00:00:45	Oh, hell, it's not a school night, huh?
14	00:00:45	00:00:47	Oh... I don't have to drive.
15	00:00:49	00:01:18	Thank you. PHIL Oh, I must...
16	00:01:18	00:01:19	I might have to skip the wine at dinner.
17	00:01:19	00:01:21	I mean...
18	00:01:23	00:01:25	Oh, that's a beautiful ring.
19	00:01:25	00:01:27	Thank you. (laughs)
20	00:01:27	00:01:28	Phil has great taste.
21	00:01:28	00:01:32	Tell me, Gloria, how did you meet your husband?
22	00:01:32	00:01:35	Oh, God, it's one of those crazy stories. Um...
23	00:01:35	00:01:43	blind date, and somewhere midway through the evening, Phil and I realized that we weren't the ones the host was trying to set up. (laughs)
24	00:01:43	00:01:44	I meant Ray.
25	00:01:44	00:01:46	How did you meet Ray?
26	00:01:49	00:01:51	Who... who the hell are you?
27	00:01:54	00:01:56	Phil!
28	00:02:50	00:02:51	Langston.
29	00:02:51	00:02:53	Ray.
30	00:02:53	00:02:55	Cops found a body. John Doe.
31	00:02:55	00:02:57	Haskell?
32	00:02:57	00:02:59	Looks like his work. They're holding the crime scene.
33	00:02:59	00:03:00	Where?
34	00:03:00	00:03:01	L.A.
35	00:03:56	00:03:57	Detective Sosa?
36	00:03:59	00:04:00	Who's asking?
37	00:04:01	00:04:03	Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
38	00:04:03	00:04:05	This is Ray Langston.
39	00:04:05	00:04:07	Thank you for calling us.
40	00:04:07	00:04:09	I didn't call you-- S.I.D. did.
41	00:04:09	00:04:11	Ask me, you people just wasted a trip.
42	00:04:13	00:04:15	Hey, Brody!
43	00:04:16	00:04:18	Vegas is here.
44	00:04:18	00:04:21	Willows. Langston. Enjoy.
45	00:04:21	00:04:23	Welcome to L.A.
46	00:04:23	00:04:26	Another hour and I'd had to get some bread.
47	00:04:26	00:04:28	Do you always eat at your crime scenes?
48	00:04:28	00:04:29	Always keep some in my kit.
49	00:04:29	00:04:31	Especially if I know I'm going to be sharing.
50	00:04:32	00:04:34	They do like peanut butter.
51	00:04:34	00:04:36	And they really loved him.
52	00:04:38	00:04:41	Sorry, buddy, you're evidence.
53	00:04:41	00:04:44	Excuse me.
54	00:04:46	00:04:47	Significant animal predation.
55	00:04:47	00:04:48	Little guy was hungry.
56	00:04:48	00:04:50	T.O.D.?
57	00:04:50	00:04:51	48 to 72 hours ago.
58	00:04:51	00:04:53	Here.
59	00:04:55	00:04:59	Looks like 12 sharp-force injuries.
60	00:04:59	00:05:00	All postmortem.
61	00:05:00	00:05:02	We got word to be on the lookout for Nate Haskell.
62	00:05:02	00:05:03	That's why I called you guys.
63	00:05:03	00:05:05	I went over Sosa's head.
64	00:05:05	00:05:07	Please tell me I'm not going to lose mine.
65	00:05:07	00:05:10	Well, the last DJK murder victim had ten postmortem stab wounds.
66	00:05:10	00:05:12	If it's Haskell, he skipped ahead.
67	00:05:12	00:05:16	Nah, Haskell considers me to be his 11th victim, even though he didn't get to stick me 11 times.
68	00:05:16	00:05:20	Well, thanks for holding the crime scene, Brody.
69	00:05:20	00:05:21	We're going to need to turn him.
70	00:05:27	00:05:29	Excuse me, you Ray? Yes. And you are?
71	00:05:29	00:05:31	I'm the guy who's going to marry your wife.
72	00:05:44	00:05:46	All clear.
73	00:05:53	00:05:56	I'll call in S.I.D.
74	00:05:58	00:06:01	Ray, I-I don't think that you should be here.
75	00:06:13	00:06:15	Let's see, uh...
76	00:06:15	00:06:16	I can have a car take you downtown.
77	00:06:16	00:06:18	Hello! That's evidence!
78	00:06:18	00:06:19	Ray, what are you doing?
79	00:06:41	00:06:45	Condo security company gave us access to the surveillance files.
80	00:06:45	00:06:48	37.
81	00:06:48	00:06:51	Metadata says it's from three nights ago.
82	00:06:51	00:06:57	I got Gloria and Phil coming home, but somebody else leaving... in theircar.
83	00:06:57	00:07:00	Well, there's no sign of Gloria and Phil.
84	00:07:00	00:07:03	My vote's for the trunk.
85	00:07:03	00:07:05	Greg, can you get us a better look?
86	00:07:09	00:07:10	Whoa.
87	00:07:10	00:07:12	Tina Vincent.
88	00:07:12	00:07:15	Who? Latest bride of Haskell.
89	00:07:15	00:07:17	Is there a passenger?
90	00:07:17	00:07:19	This angle's not helping us.
91	00:07:19	00:07:20	Maybe this will.
92	00:07:22	00:07:25	See if I can lose the fun house.
93	00:07:27	00:07:30	It's him. It's Haskell.
94	00:07:30	00:07:33	I thought you said he changed his face?
95	00:07:33	00:07:34	We were wrong.
96	00:07:34	00:07:37	Guess I was wrong about that wasted trip, huh?
97	00:07:37	00:07:40	Greg, LAPD has given us their full cooperation.
98	00:07:40	00:07:41	Get traffic cam footage from three nights ago.
99	00:07:41	00:07:43	See if you can follow the car.
100	00:07:43	00:07:44	Copy that.
101	00:07:44	00:07:46	You have my cooperation.
102	00:07:46	00:07:49	Don't forget, it's still my city.
103	00:07:56	00:07:58	He gained their trust, Catherine. He was here.
104	00:08:01	00:08:02	We'll find him, Ray.
105	00:08:02	00:08:04	And we'll find Gloria.
106	00:08:04	00:08:07	Three days and three nights of Heaven on Earth.
107	00:08:07	00:08:10	And then...
108	00:08:10	00:08:11	just Heaven.
109	00:08:11	00:08:14	Haskell's words.
110	00:08:14	00:08:16	It's what he does with his victims.
111	00:08:16	00:08:18	It's already been 72 hours.
112	00:08:18	00:08:20	That means she's already gone.
113	00:08:20	00:08:23	We'll see what the evidence says.
114	00:08:24	00:08:27	I don't think I can do this, boss.
115	00:08:27	00:08:29	I'll call Sara.
116	00:08:29	00:08:31	I'll have a car take you back to the airport.
117	00:08:31	00:08:34	Thanks.
118	00:08:45	00:08:49	Let's talk about something you enjoyed-- your first kill.
119	00:08:49	00:08:54	You never forget your first, but I think that's a little intimate for this stage of our relationship.
120	00:08:58	00:09:01	Tell us your definition of fun.
121	00:09:01	00:09:04	Fun is taking something away from somebody.
122	00:09:05	00:09:08	Oh, Ray...
123	00:09:08	00:09:10	there is a moral to this story.
124	00:09:10	00:09:13	Officer, would you mind pulling up over here?
125	00:09:13	00:09:15	Sir? There's a bar over here.
126	00:09:15	00:09:17	I want to have a drink before I get on the plane.
127	00:09:17	00:09:18	Flight's in a half-hour.
128	00:09:18	00:09:20	There's a flight to Vegas every hour.
129	00:09:20	00:09:21	I'll take the next one.
130	00:09:22	00:09:24	Look, you're welcome to join me.
131	00:09:24	00:09:28	I'm on duty... sir. (sighs)
132	00:09:28	00:09:29	I'll wait for you out front.
133	00:09:47	00:09:49	Hey, it's Ray.
134	00:09:49	00:09:52	I know you're working.
135	00:09:52	00:09:55	I didn't expect you to answer, but, uh...
136	00:09:55	00:09:58	you're the only one I can talk to.
137	00:09:58	00:10:03	The only person who I think will truly understand this.
138	00:10:03	00:10:08	At least, I hope you'll understand when I've done what I have to do.
139	00:10:08	00:10:12	You know, we all make choices...
140	00:10:12	00:10:14	live with the consequences.
141	00:10:16	00:10:18	The only person I have ever loved...
142	00:10:18	00:10:20	(door opens) is dead.
143	00:10:24	00:10:26	And now...
144	00:10:26	00:10:29	there's only one thing left for me to do.
145	00:10:30	00:10:31	Good-bye, Al.
146	00:10:39	00:10:42	There's residue on the glass.
147	00:10:42	00:10:43	They were drugged.
148	00:10:43	00:10:46	If Haskell's up to his old tricks, it's probably Salvia divinorum.
149	00:10:46	00:10:49	I'll have the L.A. lab run it.
150	00:10:49	00:10:52	Did you meet S.I.D. Brody? Yeah.
151	00:10:52	00:10:54	She seems familiar.
152	00:10:54	00:10:56	So, I found blood in the shower.
153	00:10:56	00:10:57	Looks like Haskell cleaned up.
154	00:10:57	00:11:00	I have yet to process his gift.
155	00:11:00	00:11:03	I'll give S.I.D. a hand. Okay.
156	00:11:11	00:11:13	Does this look like high-velocity blood spatter to you?
157	00:11:13	00:11:15	Yes, it does.
158	00:11:15	00:11:20	Coroner's report said Phil Baker was strangled with a ligature-- probably his own tie.
159	00:11:20	00:11:27	Blunt-force trauma to the head, 12 postmortem stab wounds-- I don't see all that Gunshots maybe?
160	00:11:27	00:11:30	Tina Vincent popped two people in Vegas.
161	00:11:30	00:11:33	I'm hoping that we don't have to add Gloria to the list.
162	00:11:33	00:11:36	(insect buzzing) You hear that?
163	00:11:36	00:11:37	What?
164	00:11:43	00:11:46	Megaselia scalaris.
165	00:11:46	00:11:49	Little buggers corrupted our crime scene.
166	00:11:53	00:11:55	No gunshot.
167	00:11:55	00:11:57	They painted the wall. So...
168	00:11:57	00:12:01	kill the man, dump the body, take the woman alive.
169	00:12:01	00:12:04	Hmm.
170	00:12:11	00:12:14	Oh... blood and tissue.
171	00:12:15	00:12:17	Postmortem stab wounds, anyone?
172	00:12:17	00:12:20	The flies weren't the only artists in this room.
173	00:12:20	00:12:24	Phil Baker was struck in the head, then strangled.
174	00:12:24	00:12:25	Stabbed postmortem.
175	00:12:25	00:12:30	The blood was the paint, the body the brush.
176	00:12:30	00:12:33	Dragged him around, created a Picasso.
177	00:12:33	00:12:35	You're thinking that all this blood came from just one source.
178	00:12:37	00:12:40	Haskell wanted Langston to feel the horror of what happened in this room.
179	00:12:40	00:12:42	He wanted to get inside his head.
180	00:12:44	00:12:46	Hey.
181	00:12:46	00:12:49	Your boy Sanders helped us track down the Bakers' car.
182	00:12:49	00:12:52	Dumped in K-Town, blood in the trunk.
183	00:12:52	00:12:53	But no Gloria?
184	00:12:53	00:12:55	Way ahead of you.
185	00:12:55	00:12:58	I got guys searching the park and all around the observatory.
186	00:12:58	00:13:00	But you may need a search party yourself.
187	00:13:00	00:13:03	Ray Langston ditched his escort to the airport.
188	00:13:03	00:13:06	And this morning's little bull in a china shop act says he's dangerous.
189	00:13:08	00:13:10	Tell me he's not armed.
190	00:13:16	00:13:20	I don't want any serial numbers. Hey, I run a respectable joint here.
191	00:13:20	00:13:23	Is that respectable enough for you?
192	00:13:26	00:13:28	I also need a laptop.
193	00:13:28	00:13:30	Gates or Jobs?
194	00:13:31	00:13:34	Let me take a look in the back.
195	00:13:55	00:13:57	I'm throwing in a holster for free.
196	00:14:01	00:14:03	That do it for you?
197	00:14:03	00:14:05	How much for the laptop?
198	00:14:05	00:14:06	Five more bills.
199	00:14:12	00:14:13	Sold.
200	00:14:13	00:14:14	No negotiating?
201	00:14:14	00:14:16	Well, I like that.
202	00:14:16	00:14:20	Hey, Willoughby Observatory-- it's the best view in town.
203	00:14:22	00:14:24	Nicky, I need you in L.A.
204	00:14:24	00:14:26	I can't find Ray. He's not answering his phone.
205	00:14:26	00:14:27	Yeah, I know. I'm worried.
206	00:14:27	00:14:30	He called the doc. He didn't sound real good.
207	00:14:30	00:14:31	It sounds like he's in a dark place.
208	00:14:31	00:14:33	Well, he's here somewhere.
209	00:14:33	00:14:34	We got to find him.
210	00:14:34	00:14:37	All right. I'm on my way. I'll find his ass.
211	00:14:37	00:14:40	We opened up Gloria's social network page.
212	00:14:40	00:14:42	Found she'd been tagged in a friend's photo.
213	00:14:42	00:14:45	We now know where Gloria and Phil met Haskell and Tina.
214	00:14:45	00:14:47	It was a benefit concert four nights ago.
215	00:14:47	00:14:49	Gloria was the main attraction.
216	00:14:49	00:14:53	Gloria and Phil invited Haskell and Tina for drinks the next night.
217	00:14:53	00:14:55	Willoughby J. Willoughby.
218	00:14:55	00:14:57	Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
219	00:14:57	00:14:58	Another of Haskell's riddles, maybe?
220	00:14:58	00:15:05	Well, the postcard that was left at the crime scene had a picture of Willoughby Canyon and Observatory on it.
221	00:15:05	00:15:07	So what's he trying to say? I don't know.
222	00:15:07	00:15:11	Maybe it has something to do with this guy Willoughby or some kind of L.A. lore or history.
223	00:15:14	00:15:15	Oh, don't look at me.
224	00:15:15	00:15:18	I... always did better in science.
225	00:15:18	00:15:22	You know, we do know somebody who's into both.
226	00:15:26	00:15:31	Willoughby J. Willoughby was a wealthy L.A. benefactor who made his fortune in shipping.
227	00:15:31	00:15:35	But the bulk of his profits were thought to have come from money-laundering.
228	00:15:35	00:15:36	Explains the benefactor part.
229	00:15:36	00:15:38	Trying to clean up his act.
230	00:15:38	00:15:39	Yeah, well, it didn't last.
231	00:15:39	00:15:43	'Cause in 1943, he shot his wife in the head during an argument.
232	00:15:43	00:15:45	Attack on his wife.
233	00:15:47	00:15:49	I think I'm starting to get the joke.
234	00:15:49	00:15:54	The postcard, the ring, Gloria in Excelsis Deo.
235	00:15:54	00:15:56	Haskell wanted Ray to come out and play.
236	00:15:56	00:15:59	So... some kind of an invitation.
237	00:15:59	00:16:02	Except we're the ones who are gonna crash the party.
238	00:16:02	00:16:06	Greg, I want to know everything there is to know about Willoughby J. Willoughby.
239	00:16:06	00:16:08	Work your magic.
240	00:16:08	00:16:10	Do my best.
241	00:17:23	00:17:25	You know why I'm here.
242	00:17:40	00:17:41	Hey.
243	00:17:41	00:17:43	Hey.
244	00:17:43	00:17:46	I drove straight from the airport to S.I.D., checked in.
245	00:17:46	00:17:47	Sara told me you'd be here.
246	00:17:47	00:17:50	Detective Sosa, this is CSI Nick Stokes.
247	00:17:50	00:17:51	Hey, man.
248	00:17:51	00:17:54	Wow. Anybody left in Vegas to catch crooks?
249	00:17:54	00:17:56	Yeah, there's still a couple of us.
250	00:17:56	00:17:57	So, what's going on here?
251	00:17:57	00:17:59	Got a call. Shots fired.
252	00:17:59	00:18:02	Units responded, found a Caucasian female.
253	00:18:03	00:18:05	Who is she?
254	00:18:05	00:18:07	Tina Vincent.
255	00:18:07	00:18:10	Somebody worked her over pretty good.
256	00:18:10	00:18:14	Looks like she might've gotten a couple of licks in, though.
257	00:18:16	00:18:18	Nine-mil.
258	00:18:18	00:18:25	One in the leg, one in the head, and a whole lot of ugly in between.
259	00:18:25	00:18:28	I used to work Narco-- whoever did this wanted information.
260	00:18:28	00:18:31	Or he was just a sadistic bastard.
261	00:18:42	00:18:46	Excuse me, what do you two think you're doing?
262	00:18:47	00:18:48	Gonna process the scene.
263	00:18:48	00:18:52	Look, I'm all about cooperating, but I'd prefer to have my people handle this.
264	00:18:55	00:18:59	Look, Detective Sosa, this is still a DJK case.
265	00:18:59	00:19:01	You find Ray Langston yet?
266	00:19:04	00:19:06	Maybe hefoundher.
267	00:19:12	00:19:14	Stokes.
268	00:19:14	00:19:15	It's Stokes, right?
269	00:19:15	00:19:17	Yeah.
270	00:19:17	00:19:19	At lvpdcsi.com?
271	00:19:19	00:19:21	Yeah.
272	00:19:21	00:19:22	(cell phone rings) Forgot something.
273	00:19:26	00:19:27	Thanks.
274	00:19:29	00:19:30	Morgan.
275	00:19:31	00:19:34	I just figured it out-- you're Conrad's daughter.
276	00:19:34	00:19:37	Before the divorce. (laughs)
277	00:19:37	00:19:39	Last time I saw you, you were just a kid.
278	00:19:39	00:19:41	So you don't go by Ecklie.
279	00:19:41	00:19:42	I took my stepdad's last name.
280	00:19:43	00:19:46	I'll catch you guys later.
281	00:19:48	00:19:50	I like her style.
282	00:19:51	00:19:55	I processed Tina Vincent's room.
283	00:19:55	00:20:01	Prints I lifted place three people there-- Nate Haskell, Tina Vincent...
284	00:20:01	00:20:04	And CSI Raymond Langston.
285	00:20:05	00:20:07	You want to explain that to me?
286	00:20:07	00:20:14	I can't. I got enough trouble chasing down the bad guys; I don't need to be chasing the good ones, too. Look, we don't know what happened in that room.
287	00:20:14	00:20:20	Yeah, we do. Someone tortured that girl till they got what they wanted, then they put a bullet through her head.
288	00:20:21	00:20:23	does Ray Langston carry? No.
289	00:20:26	00:20:29	What about blood evidence?
290	00:20:30	00:20:37	I found blood on the doorknob and on the vic's ring, along with epithelials under her fingernails.
291	00:20:37	00:20:39	Consistent with a struggle.
292	00:20:39	00:20:41	DNA comes back to an unknown African-American male.
293	00:20:41	00:20:46	You run it against CSI Langston? I would have, but... he wasn't in the system.
294	00:20:46	00:20:48	How is that possible? Man's a CSI.
295	00:20:48	00:20:50	Submission is voluntary. Great.
296	00:20:50	00:20:53	So if I ever want to kill someone, I'll just transfer to Vegas.
297	00:20:53	00:20:56	Ray's not a murderer. No?
298	00:20:56	00:20:58	He's definitely a suspect.
299	00:21:18	00:21:20	How did you find me?
300	00:21:20	00:21:21	I'm part hound dog.
301	00:21:21	00:21:29	I pinged your cell, traced it back to a tower near Dodger Stadium, then checked out all the motels one cut above fleabag.
302	00:21:29	00:21:31	It was really pretty easy.
303	00:21:31	00:21:33	When did you start carrying a gun again?
304	00:21:33	00:21:34	You need to go home, Nick.
305	00:21:34	00:21:39	You're not taking me back. I'm not here to take you back; I'm here to help you out.
306	00:21:39	00:21:41	Haskell wants me.
307	00:21:41	00:21:44	All right? He doesn't want you.
308	00:21:44	00:21:45	Raymond...
309	00:21:45	00:21:48	Tina Vincent's dead.
310	00:21:52	00:21:54	Now, I know you didn't kill her...
311	00:21:54	00:21:56	but you need to tell me what happened.
312	00:21:57	00:22:00	Haskell wanted me to find her.
313	00:22:03	00:22:04	Where is he, Tina?
314	00:22:04	00:22:06	You want to hurt me?
315	00:22:06	00:22:10	You're going to tell me what I want to know.
316	00:22:11	00:22:14	And did she?
317	00:22:14	00:22:18	All she would said is that Nate wanted me to have that.
318	00:22:18	00:22:21	Said the blood on it was Gloria's.
319	00:22:21	00:22:24	It used every ounce of my strength not to hurt her.
320	00:22:24	00:22:29	Well, Haskell came back after you left and he put a real good hurting on her for you.
321	00:22:29	00:22:32	You do realize what he's doing, don't you?
322	00:22:32	00:22:33	Yes, yes, he's isolating me.
323	00:22:33	00:22:34	He's making you a fugitive.
324	00:22:34	00:22:37	He's cutting you off from everyone and everything.
325	00:22:37	00:22:42	And believe me, if it was this easy for me to find you, LAPD won't have a problem.
326	00:22:42	00:22:44	Take a look at this.
327	00:22:46	00:22:49	I found this at Tina Vincent's crime scene.
328	00:22:49	00:22:50	You never forget your first.
329	00:22:50	00:22:51	Same ticket, same message.
330	00:22:51	00:22:53	What is he saying?
331	00:22:53	00:22:56	This sick bastard is leaving us a bread crumb trail.
332	00:22:56	00:22:57	All we have to do is figure out where it leads.
333	00:22:57	00:23:00	I can't exactly call the lab now, can I?
334	00:23:00	00:23:02	I can.
335	00:23:08	00:23:09	How we doing, Greg?
336	00:23:09	00:23:11	Ask him about Langston.
337	00:23:11	00:23:12	I found the manufacturer of the tickets.
338	00:23:12	00:23:15	Ask him about Langston.
339	00:23:15	00:23:16	Running the numbers through the company's database right now.
340	00:23:16	00:23:18	Will you ask him? Shut up.
341	00:23:18	00:23:19	What?
342	00:23:19	00:23:20	Um, sorry. I wasn't talking to you.
343	00:23:20	00:23:22	Uh, Nick, yeah, it's me.
344	00:23:22	00:23:33	Um, I heard the news, and, uh, while I can empathize with Ray, I feel I must express my concern that his Dirty Harry style antics of late can only reflect badly on the team.
345	00:23:33	00:23:34	Hodges, put Greg back on the phone.
346	00:23:34	00:23:36	Yeah, will do.
347	00:23:36	00:23:39	Just tell me, is there any news from Ray?
348	00:23:39	00:23:41	But when I find him, you'll be the first to know.
349	00:23:41	00:23:43	Give me that.
350	00:23:43	00:23:44	All right, I think I got something.
351	00:23:44	00:23:48	According to this, the tickets were delivered to L.A.
352	00:23:48	00:23:51	Part of a shipment to the Santa Monica Pier.
353	00:24:00	00:24:03	The carousel.
354	00:24:03	00:24:05	You never forget your first.
355	00:24:05	00:24:07	What are you talking about?
356	00:24:07	00:24:09	My first date with Gloria was on a carousel in Baltimore.
357	00:24:09	00:24:10	How would Haskell know something like that?
358	00:24:13	00:24:15	We may be walking into something here.
359	00:24:16	00:24:18	You got my back, right?
360	00:24:18	00:24:19	Always.
361	00:25:05	00:25:08	This isn't our first date, Ray.
362	00:25:10	00:25:12	It's just our first without a chaperone.
363	00:25:17	00:25:18	Get your hands up.
364	00:25:20	00:25:23	Ahh... Ray!
365	00:25:23	00:25:25	No fair.
366	00:25:25	00:25:27	You're under arrest, you son of a bitch.
367	00:25:27	00:25:29	Yeah. (two gunshots)
368	00:25:31	00:25:32	Where is he?
369	00:25:34	00:25:36	I got the other side.
370	00:25:36	00:25:38	(door opens) Outside, Ray.
371	00:26:24	00:26:27	Haskell, hold it right there.
372	00:26:27	00:26:27	Drop the gun!
373	00:26:27	00:26:30	I'm a CSI, in pursuit of a suspect.
374	00:26:30	00:26:32	Look, I don't care who the hell you are-- drop the gun!
375	00:26:32	00:26:34	You're making a big mistake. Listen to me!
376	00:26:34	00:26:35	No, you listen!
377	00:26:35	00:26:38	Drop the gun, get on your knees and put your hands behind your head!
378	00:26:39	00:26:42	Do it, now!
379	00:26:45	00:26:46	I'm not getting on my knees.
380	00:27:16	00:27:17	Don't move! Drop the gun!
381	00:27:17	00:27:19	Listen to him, Ray.
382	00:27:22	00:27:23	It can't end like this, Ray.
383	00:27:23	00:27:28	Oh, I know how you feel, Ray, but if you pull that trigger now, you'll kill more than me.
384	00:27:28	00:27:30	Two people die, Ray!
385	00:27:33	00:27:34	She's still alive!
386	00:27:34	00:27:36	Gloria's still alive, Ray!
387	00:27:36	00:27:39	Drop the gun, now!
388	00:27:52	00:27:59	Nate Haskell is responsible for the deaths of over 25 people, including four law enforcement officers in Las Vegas.
389	00:27:59	00:28:03	And last night he damn near took the life of one of my men.
390	00:28:03	00:28:05	So how come he didn't take yours?
391	00:28:05	00:28:08	I can't answer that.
392	00:28:09	00:28:10	That's a load of crap.
393	00:28:13	00:28:14	Where'd you get the gun?
394	00:28:14	00:28:17	I took it from an assailant who attempted to mug me in MacArthur Park.
395	00:28:17	00:28:19	My intention was to turn it in.
396	00:28:19	00:28:22	You know something...
397	00:28:22	00:28:25	you're lucky Officer Davies was wearing a vest...
398	00:28:25	00:28:30	and that the slug we took out of it was a match to the bullet that killed Tina Vincent.
399	00:28:30	00:28:33	But you knew where to find her.
400	00:28:33	00:28:35	And you knew where to find Haskell.
401	00:28:38	00:28:43	Now, I don't care if you're inside his head, or he's inside yours.
402	00:28:43	00:28:44	You know what's going on here.
403	00:28:46	00:28:48	You got a choice.
404	00:28:48	00:28:52	You talk to me, or I'm putting your ass on a plane back to Vegas myself.
405	00:28:56	00:28:59	Am I being charged with a crime?
406	00:29:20	00:29:22	I'll be the one to get him on the plane.
407	00:29:22	00:29:24	You know, if it was up to me, I'd send you all home.
408	00:29:24	00:29:32	But then, I got a problem-- Haskell drops another body and it's my ass in the sling 'cause I'm the moron who sent the Haskell experts back to Vegas.
409	00:29:32	00:29:34	So no free airfare then?
410	00:29:34	00:29:38	How about no more surprises?
411	00:29:51	00:29:53	I'll meet you back at S.I.D.
412	00:29:53	00:29:55	I'll go check in with Morgan.
413	00:29:58	00:29:59	I told you to find him, Nicky.
414	00:29:59	00:30:01	I did find him. I should've known.
415	00:30:01	00:30:04	You had to have his back, had to cowboy up on some vigilante mission.
416	00:30:04	00:30:08	I mean, I get him, but you have no excuse.
417	00:30:08	00:30:10	So are you sending me home, now, too?
418	00:30:10	00:30:12	Oh, I'd like to, but I can't, because I need you here.
419	00:30:12	00:30:14	And, luckily, LAPD is giving you a second chance.
420	00:30:14	00:30:15	Ray...
421	00:30:15	00:30:18	you're going back to Vegas.
422	00:30:18	00:30:20	Do I have to post a guard at your door?
423	00:30:20	00:30:23	No, that won't be necessary.
424	00:30:30	00:30:32	We'll get him.
425	00:30:35	00:30:37	Smooth, polished surface.
426	00:30:37	00:30:38	It looks like beach sand.
427	00:30:38	00:30:40	Recovered from Tina Vincent's room.
428	00:30:40	00:30:43	Well, that makes sense-- Haskell was at the pier, he spent some time at the beach.
429	00:30:43	00:30:45	Found more than just beach sand.
430	00:30:45	00:30:47	I think he's been spending time somewhere else.
431	00:30:47	00:30:49	Put your nose down that one.
432	00:30:51	00:30:53	Nesosilicates, garnet.
433	00:30:53	00:30:55	There's chips of paint in the mix.
434	00:30:55	00:30:58	This sand is from construction.
435	00:30:58	00:30:59	Sandblasting, maybe.
436	00:30:59	00:31:03	Plenty of that downtown, at least until the economy hit the skids.
437	00:31:03	00:31:05	Maybe Haskell's squatting.
438	00:31:05	00:31:08	Or it's where he left Gloria's body.
439	00:31:11	00:31:14	The rings of a tree will give up its history.
440	00:31:16	00:31:20	Blast the paint off the side of a building, layers are going to tell you the same story.
441	00:31:22	00:31:24	Time for a little chip and dip.
442	00:32:07	00:32:09	Hey, Ray.
443	00:32:09	00:32:11	Hey.
444	00:32:12	00:32:15	Thanks for coming to get me.
445	00:32:15	00:32:16	Well, Catherine didn't give me much choice.
446	00:32:16	00:32:18	Yeah. But I would've been here anyway.
447	00:32:20	00:32:21	What's going on?
448	00:32:22	00:32:26	Haskell could've killed me, he didn't.
449	00:32:26	00:32:28	Yeah, well, maybe he didn't want to kill you.
450	00:32:28	00:32:32	He just... wants to keep hurting you.
451	00:32:33	00:32:35	Can we go back to the office for a while?
452	00:32:35	00:32:36	You're on leave, Ray.
453	00:32:36	00:32:38	You think that's a good idea? I don't know.
454	00:32:38	00:32:41	You think it's a good idea for me to just go home and sit in an empty house?
455	00:32:43	00:32:45	Come on.
456	00:32:45	00:32:49	The trace that we thought was sand in Tina Vincent's room turned out to be commercial sandblasting.
457	00:32:49	00:32:50	Found paint chips in the mix.
458	00:32:50	00:32:51	Gave us a profile of the building.
459	00:32:51	00:32:53	You're thinking if we find the building, we may find Haskell.
460	00:32:53	00:32:55	Base layer had traces of concrete.
461	00:32:55	00:32:57	Suggests it's industrial.
462	00:32:57	00:32:59	12 layers?
463	00:32:59	00:33:02	Damn. You figure buildings get a new coat of paint every six to eight years.
464	00:33:02	00:33:03	Place is old.
465	00:33:03	00:33:08	But the sandblasting suggests it's under renovation, at least at some point recently.
466	00:33:08	00:33:13	Chemical composition of the paint indicated epoxy formulations-- maintenance paint used in railings, fire doors...
467	00:33:13	00:33:18	So, what, we're talking about a school, hospital, or government building?
468	00:33:18	00:33:19	Narrows it down.
469	00:33:19	00:33:23	Let's have LAPD pull building and demolition permits over the last three years.
470	00:33:23	00:33:24	We'll start there.
471	00:33:24	00:33:27	Nice work, Morgan.
472	00:33:28	00:33:30	Yeah, thanks.
473	00:33:41	00:33:43	Hey. Hey.
474	00:33:45	00:33:47	Access denied.
475	00:33:47	00:33:51	Yeah, you're probably thinking virus, but, uh, it's Willows.
476	00:33:51	00:33:53	Catherine pulled my privileges?
477	00:33:53	00:33:57	I'm sure it's just temporary. You're damn right it's only temporary 'cause you're going to give me your passcode right now.
478	00:33:57	00:34:00	No, I can't do that. Or I'm going to go all Dirty Harry on you.
479	00:34:01	00:34:03	You were listening.
480	00:34:04	00:34:06	I'm going to do this one time.
481	00:34:16	00:34:20	Willoughby J. Willoughby.
482	00:34:20	00:34:22	Born 1895, died 1963.
483	00:34:22	00:34:29	Shipping magnate, Willoughby donated thousands of acres of land to the city of Los Angeles.
484	00:34:29	00:34:30	What's going on?
485	00:34:30	00:34:33	You can be part of the problem or part of the solution.
486	00:34:33	00:34:35	Solution.
487	00:34:36	00:34:38	Back to Willoughby J. Willoughby, huh?
488	00:34:38	00:34:42	Thought we left him behind with Tina Vincent at The Penwick. We did.
489	00:34:42	00:34:44	Not so sure about Haskell, though.
490	00:34:48	00:34:50	Man shoots his wife in the head, kills her.
491	00:34:50	00:34:53	I mean, there's got to be... some deeper meaning.
492	00:34:53	00:34:55	He didn't kill her.
493	00:34:55	00:34:58	She survived?
494	00:34:58	00:34:59	Yes.
495	00:34:59	00:35:00	Is that significant?
496	00:35:00	00:35:03	Yes. Tell me more about the crime.
497	00:35:03	00:35:06	LAPD faxed me copies of the old case files.
498	00:35:06	00:35:09	Apparently, Willoughby was a bigamist.
499	00:35:09	00:35:13	Willoughby J. Willoughby-- a name so nice, he married twice.
500	00:35:13	00:35:17	Willoughby's second wife Audrey was from Las Vegas.
501	00:35:17	00:35:24	The night of the shooting, Wife Number One-- Sylvia-- surprised Willoughby and Wife Number Two during a tryst at The Penwick.
502	00:35:24	00:35:27	One thing led to another, and Willoughby shot Wife Number One.
503	00:35:27	00:35:30	So Wife Number Two witnessed the crime?
504	00:35:30	00:35:34	Along with her seven-year-old son, who was staying in the adjoining room.
505	00:35:34	00:35:37	And that seven-year-old boy is Nate Haskell.
506	00:35:38	00:35:40	If Nate Haskell were 75 years old.
507	00:35:40	00:35:42	What was the boy's name?
508	00:35:42	00:35:44	Arvin.
509	00:35:44	00:35:46	Wife Number One survives.
510	00:35:47	00:35:50	Do we know what happened to Wife Number Two?
511	00:35:50	00:35:59	According to court records, uh, Audrey Willoughby, two years following the shooting, was committed to a psychiatric facility-- St. Collette's Hospital in L.A.
512	00:35:59	00:36:06	The boy was placed into the custody of his uncle, and that's pretty much where the trail ends. Hmm.
513	00:36:06	00:36:10	Wife died the same year the hospital closed in the mid-1980s.
514	00:36:10	00:36:12	Is there a problem?
515	00:36:12	00:36:18	Catherine said that Haskell might be hiding out in an industrial building, maybe a hospital.
516	00:36:20	00:36:23	One from around the same era...
517	00:36:24	00:36:27	...undergoing renovations.
518	00:36:30	00:36:33	I've, uh, got to call Catherine.
519	00:36:50	00:36:52	David. Yeah.
520	00:36:52	00:36:53	Would you mind getting us some coffee?
521	00:36:53	00:36:54	Absolutely.
522	00:36:54	00:36:56	Thank you.
523	00:37:16	00:37:22	Mr. Thorpe, do you know where Tina and this squirrelly guy are shacking up?
524	00:37:22	00:37:24	The old house across the road.
525	00:38:05	00:38:07	She's still alive!
526	00:38:07	00:38:09	Gloria's still alive, Ray!
527	00:38:10	00:38:13	Hello, Nate.
528	00:38:13	00:38:19	Show Detective Sosa responding code three to St. Collette's Hospital with Las Vegas CSI, requesting additional backup.
529	00:40:58	00:40:59	Mr. Thorpe.
530	00:40:59	00:41:00	Help me.
531	00:41:04	00:41:05	Please.
532	00:41:05	00:41:07	Mr. Thorpe, where's your son?
533	00:41:07	00:41:09	Warner...
534	00:41:09	00:41:10	Where is he?
535	00:41:10	00:41:11	Please...
536	00:41:11	00:41:13	help.
537	00:41:22	00:41:25	Charlie-07, Langston.
538	00:41:25	00:41:29	Request immediate backup and paramedics to my location-- the old Thorpe farm.
539	00:41:29	00:41:30	Code three.
540	00:41:32	00:41:35	Ray?
541	00:41:39	00:41:42	Ray.
542	00:41:46	00:41:48	Gloria.
543	00:41:53	00:41:55	I'm gonna get you out of here.
544	00:42:22	00:42:24	Welcome home, Ray.
545	00:42:29	00:42:31	Welcome home.
