0	00:00:04	00:03:05	[♪ Spanish Music ♪] Female, early 30s, Hispanic descent, vitreous potassium was 11.74 milli-equivalents per liter, so PMI's approximately six hours.
1	00:03:05	00:03:07	00 a.m.
2	00:03:08	00:03:10	C.O.D.?
3	00:03:10	00:03:11	From what I got here, I can't tell you much.
4	00:03:11	00:03:17	Minimal dilation in the pupils indicates decapitation was postmortem.
5	00:03:17	00:03:24	Scalp shows naked follicles without hairs, no inflammation around them indicates removal was postmortem as well.
6	00:03:24	00:03:26	Ripped out in chunks.
7	00:03:27	00:03:30	Takes time and dedication to do something like that.
8	00:03:30	00:03:32	And a lot of hatred.
9	00:03:32	00:03:37	So her eyebrows have been shaved off and drawn back on with eyeliner.
10	00:03:37	00:03:40	I know that's popular among Latinos in 28th Street.
11	00:03:41	00:03:44	She could be a banger or a girlfriend of one.
12	00:03:44	00:03:48	Either way at least, she took good care of her teeth.
13	00:03:52	00:03:53	What is that, nine digits?
14	00:03:53	00:03:55	Social Security number.
15	00:03:55	00:04:00	Dentists usually put on some form of identification on removable bridgework.
16	00:04:00	00:04:02	It's better than a license plate.
17	00:04:26	00:04:33	Pulled a couple of likely palm prints on the newspaper the head was on, but I don't think that's going to be our best bet.
18	00:04:33	00:04:39	Okay, start with those, but make sure you run the partials off the box as well 'cause I got Ecklie looking over my shoulder, so, uh...
19	00:04:39	00:04:40	Cover your ass.
20	00:04:40	00:04:42	Yes. My pleasure.
21	00:04:42	00:04:45	Large, elevated vertebral scales.
22	00:04:45	00:04:47	Definitely not your typical U.S. Crotalus.
23	00:04:47	00:04:50	Herpetologists always throwing the Latin around.
24	00:04:50	00:04:52	What's wrong with just calling him rattlesnake?
25	00:04:52	00:04:55	My specialty, my jargon.
26	00:04:55	00:05:01	Stripes at the base of the neck makes it Crotalus simus, indigenous to southern coastal Mexico.
27	00:05:01	00:05:05	Apparent Mexican vic on a Mexican newspaper with a Mexican snake.
28	00:05:05	00:05:08	You don't find a whole lot of these buzz-worms around Vegas anyway, do you?
29	00:05:08	00:05:10	Nowhere outside a zoo.
30	00:05:10	00:05:12	These snakes like to burrow in damp soil.
31	00:05:13	00:05:15	They like it hot and humid.
32	00:05:15	00:05:16	We're hot and dry.
33	00:05:16	00:05:17	For a snake, big difference.
34	00:05:17	00:05:20	What are the chances that thing just crawled in their on its own?
35	00:05:20	00:05:24	In a newspaper dispenser in the middle of a desert city?
36	00:05:24	00:05:25	No way.
37	00:05:25	00:05:28	I think it was dead when it was shoved down the victim's throat.
38	00:05:42	00:05:43	The only car up here.
39	00:05:43	00:05:44	Security called it in.
40	00:05:44	00:05:46	Is that a handicap van?
41	00:05:46	00:05:47	Dead guy's in the driver's seat.
42	00:05:47	00:05:48	Any witnesses?
43	00:05:48	00:05:49	Nope.
44	00:05:49	00:05:51	And no surveillance either.
45	00:05:51	00:05:53	We ain't on the Strip, baby.
46	00:05:53	00:05:54	500 bucks and a Nevada license.
47	00:05:54	00:05:56	Vincent DeCarlo, 28.
48	00:05:59	00:06:03	It's an expensive-looking Italian suit just to be a chauffeur.
49	00:06:07	00:06:08	It's a wheelchair.
50	00:06:08	00:06:10	Any indication he's handicapped?
51	00:06:14	00:06:17	He's not wearing prosthetics and his soles are worn.
52	00:06:17	00:06:19	Somebody's missing their wheels.
53	00:06:19	00:06:22	Gunshot wound to the head.
54	00:06:22	00:06:24	Looks like it came through the windshield.
55	00:06:27	00:06:29	Crater on the windshield faces out.
56	00:06:29	00:06:33	Which means that the shot came from inside the van.
57	00:06:43	00:06:45	So he's tapped out.
58	00:06:45	00:06:46	Catherine asked if I could lend a hand.
59	00:06:46	00:06:47	Thanks.
60	00:06:52	00:06:53	You see that blood spot on the lapel?
61	00:06:53	00:06:56	It's inconsistent with the head wound.
62	00:06:56	00:06:59	To avoid cross-contamination, you think you could cut that out for me?
63	00:06:59	00:07:00	Oh, sure.
64	00:07:02	00:07:03	Possible GSR.
65	00:07:05	00:07:10	Which means the shot was fired from the wheelchair.
66	00:07:10	00:07:11	How'd he shoot him in the face?
67	00:07:11	00:07:13	Hey, Vinnie.
68	00:07:17	00:07:21	So we got a guy who fired a shot from a wheelchair and then escaped on foot.
69	00:07:23	00:07:28	Social came back on the dental work of Veronica Juarez.
70	00:07:28	00:07:30	No immediate family in the States.
71	00:07:30	00:07:32	Apartment's leased in her name.
72	00:07:32	00:07:36	Well, that's why bangers have girlfriends; sign things they can't.
73	00:07:36	00:07:38	This is a pretty nice place.
74	00:07:38	00:07:40	A long way from 28th Street.
75	00:07:40	00:07:41	Sure is.
76	00:07:46	00:07:47	Catherine, Nick.
77	00:07:54	00:07:56	Gangbanger girlfriend with a degree?
78	00:07:56	00:07:58	Sounds like a rock band.
79	00:08:18	00:08:19	Hey, Vega?
80	00:08:20	00:08:23	Check out these pics.
81	00:08:24	00:08:26	Think she liked to party?
82	00:08:26	00:08:28	That barely looks like the same girl.
83	00:08:28	00:08:29	I know.
84	00:08:29	00:08:30	I'm going to check out the kitchen.
85	00:08:31	00:08:31	Okay.
86	00:08:32	00:08:34	Well, there's no signs of sexual activity.
87	00:08:40	00:08:41	Oh, hang on now.
88	00:08:46	00:08:49	That looks like pure crystal meth.
89	00:08:49	00:08:51	You could be up for a week straight on that stuff and not even know it.
90	00:08:51	00:08:53	Perfect drug for this town.
91	00:08:56	00:09:00	Hey, you think that our vic was a groupie?
92	00:09:04	00:09:06	Looks like a mariachi band with artillery.
93	00:09:06	00:09:09	I had a big dose of them when I worked with a gang unit in LA.
94	00:09:09	00:09:10	The band?
95	00:09:10	00:09:11	The scumbags who listen to that music.
96	00:09:11	00:09:13	Sinaloa cowboys.
97	00:09:13	00:09:14	Big drug producers.
98	00:09:14	00:09:23	Okay. We've got a female victim with a degree, Mexican artwork, drugs and Sinaloan cowboys.
99	00:10:13	00:10:17	¿Que paso, que paso, que paso?!
100	00:10:17	00:10:19	Hacienda Corona!
101	00:10:19	00:10:22	¿Como estan, como estan, como estan, como estan todos?
102	00:10:22	00:10:24	Que bueno, que bueno, que bueno!
103	00:10:24	00:10:28	Otra cancion! Otra cancion!
104	00:10:39	00:10:41	Carnal, conoces esta muchacha?
105	00:10:43	00:10:44	Sordo, contestame!
106	00:10:44	00:10:45	That's Carla.
107	00:10:45	00:10:47	Carla? Not Veronica?
108	00:10:47	00:10:49	Nah. The girl in the picture told me her name was Carla.
109	00:10:50	00:10:52	Yeah, well, the bouncer says that she hangs out here a lot.
110	00:10:52	00:10:54	Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
111	00:11:01	00:11:03	She, uh, friends with the band?
112	00:11:03	00:11:04	I don't know about friends.
113	00:11:04	00:11:07	I mean, her and every other girl in here jocks 'em.
114	00:11:07	00:11:10	I mean, Extremo, bro, they're the best. Come on.
115	00:11:22	00:11:30	I know my Spanish is a little rusty, but I think he just said, She was a liar, she wasn't who she said she was.
116	00:11:34	00:11:38	She stole my heart, so I stole her life.
117	00:11:43	00:11:44	I made the snake...
118	00:11:46	00:11:48	eat a snake.
119	00:11:52	00:11:53	...esta cancion...
120	00:12:02	00:12:03	Oye.
121	00:12:03	00:12:05	LVPD. We need to talk.
122	00:12:05	00:12:08	Leave your card, I'll send you a picture and autograph, huh?
123	00:12:08	00:12:11	That's not really what I'm after, my man. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
124	00:12:11	00:12:12	Excuse me.
125	00:12:12	00:12:13	I'm their manager. El jefe.
126	00:12:13	00:12:16	You want to ask my band questions, you can ask me first.
127	00:12:16	00:12:17	Great.
128	00:12:17	00:12:19	What can you tell us about the song they just played?
129	00:12:19	00:12:20	What do you want to know?
130	00:12:20	00:12:24	Quite frankly, the lyrics are very similar to a homicide we're investigating.
131	00:12:24	00:12:26	That narcocorrido was written ten years ago.
132	00:12:26	00:12:28	It's a classic.
133	00:12:28	00:12:29	Surprised you haven't heard it.
134	00:12:29	00:12:32	I don't listen to crap about doing drugs and killing cops.
135	00:12:35	00:12:37	Why don't you buy a CD on the way out.
136	00:12:38	00:12:38	Yeah, I might do that.
137	00:12:39	00:12:41	Hey, listen, one more thing, if you could.
138	00:12:41	00:12:43	This girl, you know who she is?
139	00:12:43	00:12:45	That's Carla.
140	00:12:45	00:12:46	She's dead?
141	00:12:46	00:12:47	Yeah.
142	00:12:47	00:12:51	That's too bad.
143	00:12:51	00:12:51	Yeah.
144	00:12:52	00:12:54	She was a loyal fan.
145	00:12:54	00:12:57	She knew the words to every song we did.
146	00:12:59	00:13:01	Anything else?
147	00:13:03	00:13:05	Yeah. Your name and number.
148	00:13:07	00:13:10	Hi.
149	00:13:11	00:13:15	You got a minute? Sure.
150	00:13:15	00:13:18	We really haven't had a chance to talk since the staff changes.
151	00:13:18	00:13:27	I, uh... I wanted to let you know that I said some things to Ecklie that might have done the team a disservice.
152	00:13:27	00:13:29	Ecklie wanted to break up the team, and he did.
153	00:13:29	00:13:33	He asked me if you and I had had our post-PEAP counseling session.
154	00:13:33	00:13:34	And we didn't.
155	00:13:34	00:13:37	Regardless, you should never have to cover for your boss.
156	00:13:37	00:13:38	I'm sorry.
157	00:13:38	00:13:42	You've always been a little more than a boss to me.
158	00:13:43	00:13:45	Why do you think I moved to Vegas?
159	00:13:48	00:13:51	Look, I know our relationship has been complicated.
160	00:13:51	00:13:53	It's probably my fault.
161	00:13:53	00:13:56	It's probably definitely my fault.
162	00:13:56	00:13:59	You completed your counseling, right?
163	00:13:59	00:14:00	Yeah. Yes.
164	00:14:00	00:14:01	And...?
165	00:14:01	00:14:05	Let's just say that...
166	00:14:05	00:14:07	I sometimes...
167	00:14:07	00:14:11	I look for validation in inappropriate places.
168	00:14:19	00:14:22	Look...
169	00:14:22	00:14:25	Let's, um...
170	00:14:28	00:14:30	It's okay.
171	00:14:30	00:14:32	Okay.
172	00:14:32	00:14:34	You know what, we did our session.
173	00:14:36	00:14:39	Don't forget to document this for Ecklie.
174	00:14:39	00:14:42	Right.
175	00:14:42	00:14:44	Thanks.
176	00:14:54	00:15:01	Bullet entered through the left zygomatic arch, then penetrated the brain, then fragmented up.
177	00:15:02	00:15:04	The bullet never exited?
178	00:15:04	00:15:05	Not even close.
179	00:15:06	00:15:13	The right ear injury is a separate wound unrelated to the entry in the face.
180	00:15:13	00:15:14	So he was shot twice.
181	00:15:14	00:15:17	Yeah, can you identify the weapon off these?
182	00:15:18	00:15:20	It's highly unlikely. The frags are too small.
183	00:15:20	00:15:23	I'll go back to the scene, see if I can find the AWOL bullet.
184	00:15:23	00:15:25	All right.
185	00:15:25	00:15:27	So I hear you found a wheelchair.
186	00:15:27	00:15:30	Yeah. No identifiable prints, only smudges.
187	00:15:30	00:15:31	Did you check the serial number?
188	00:15:31	00:15:33	No.
189	00:15:33	00:15:35	You know, wheelchairs are registered with medical supply companies.
190	00:15:37	00:15:40	It's not something the average person would know.
191	00:15:40	00:15:42	Thanks. Good looking out.
192	00:15:45	00:15:50	Mrs. Bakerset's grandson bought her a top-of-the-line chair about a year ago after her stroke.
193	00:15:50	00:15:52	We need to talk to her.
194	00:15:52	00:15:54	I'm sorry, she passed away last week.
195	00:15:54	00:15:56	Really? That's strange.
196	00:15:56	00:15:58	We found her wheelchair at a crime scene downtown.
197	00:15:58	00:16:00	Any idea how it got there?
198	00:16:00	00:16:02	No, no, no, Bonnie hadn't left hare in at least six months.
199	00:16:03	00:16:04	Her place is right over here.
200	00:16:04	00:16:10	When the residents pass, their property remains in the room until their family picks it up.
201	00:16:11	00:16:13	Her grandson said he'd swing by next week.
202	00:16:13	00:16:16	The woman loved to shop.
203	00:16:16	00:16:19	I'll see if I can get you some info on that wheelchair.
204	00:16:19	00:16:21	Loved to shop?
205	00:16:21	00:16:23	Looks more like a compulsion.
206	00:16:23	00:16:25	Fly fishing rods...
207	00:16:25	00:16:30	air purification systems, vitamins, yoga tapes...
208	00:16:30	00:16:32	cleaning products...
209	00:16:32	00:16:35	Most of these boxes have the same return address.
210	00:16:35	00:16:37	N.Z.A., Inc.
211	00:16:37	00:16:38	It's local.
212	00:16:38	00:16:40	It's in Henderson.
213	00:16:40	00:16:41	Scumbag telemarketers.
214	00:16:47	00:16:49	Watch your fingers.
215	00:16:50	00:16:51	Excuse me...
216	00:16:51	00:16:52	What's going on?
217	00:16:52	00:16:54	And you are?
218	00:16:54	00:16:55	Stuart Manslow.
219	00:16:55	00:16:58	And I'm Betsy Lewis.
220	00:16:58	00:17:00	You shouldn't be in here.
221	00:17:00	00:17:02	Well, Betsy, I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas police.
222	00:17:02	00:17:04	And this is Warrick Brown with the Crime Lab.
223	00:17:04	00:17:05	Hi, folks.
224	00:17:05	00:17:09	Could you all tell me what's the deal with all these boxes?
225	00:17:09	00:17:12	Buying things made Bonnie happy.
226	00:17:12	00:17:15	After her husband died, she was lost.
227	00:17:15	00:17:17	Then a nice salesman kept calling.
228	00:17:17	00:17:19	They would talk for hours.
229	00:17:19	00:17:21	If you ask me, she liked the attention.
230	00:17:21	00:17:24	Ma'am, do you know what happened to Bonnie's wheelchair?
231	00:17:25	00:17:27	It was a gift from her grandson.
232	00:17:27	00:17:33	Yeah. He's not a doctor, but he does all right for himself.
233	00:17:39	00:17:43	Off we go into the wild, blue yonder.
234	00:17:49	00:17:50	Why are you here?
235	00:17:50	00:17:52	Grissom said it'd be okay for me to come help.
236	00:17:52	00:17:55	I need the experience.
237	00:17:55	00:17:57	Well, if we can't find the bullets, we find the shell casings.
238	00:17:57	00:18:03	I'm thinking the shooter had the driver at gunpoint, forced him to drive up to the roof 'cause it was deserted.
239	00:18:05	00:18:07	Give me your pen.
240	00:18:09	00:18:11	You don't shoot a man with the door open.
241	00:18:20	00:18:22	Keep your eye on this.
242	00:18:32	00:18:34	You got it?
243	00:18:34	00:18:37	The shooter had to open the door when he took off.
244	00:18:40	00:18:42	Okay, stop.
245	00:18:57	00:18:58	Nine-millimeter.
246	00:18:58	00:19:00	Photograph it.
247	00:19:14	00:19:15	Hi.
248	00:19:15	00:19:16	Oh, hey.
249	00:19:16	00:19:18	What is this?
250	00:19:18	00:19:21	Oh, it's, uh, it's an old case from San Diego.
251	00:19:21	00:19:29	They were found the next dawn, in a dry river bed, their intestines exposed, and many cats feasting upon them.
252	00:19:29	00:19:33	Yeah, now you put that to music, sing it in Spanish, and you have a narcocorrido.
253	00:19:33	00:19:35	Narco what?
254	00:19:35	00:19:37	A corrido is a Mexican ballad.
255	00:19:37	00:19:38	A narcocorrido...
256	00:19:38	00:19:40	A drug ballad.
257	00:19:40	00:19:47	Kind of more or less, except their songs include actual events, like specific dates, names...
258	00:19:47	00:19:49	Here.
259	00:19:49	00:19:50	Come over here, check this out.
260	00:19:59	00:20:02	This girl was shacked up with a local drug lord.
261	00:20:02	00:20:05	He dumps her, she rats him out to the authorities.
262	00:20:05	00:20:07	The rest of the body was never found.
263	00:20:07	00:20:09	But the song was a big hit.
264	00:20:09	00:20:16	So apart from having her hair removed, Veronica Juarez's murder was life imitating art.
265	00:20:16	00:20:22	Yeah, and if that's the case, anyone who knows this song could... could be the killer.
266	00:20:22	00:20:28	We don't even know that much about the victim, other than she was somewhere between art lover and meth user.
267	00:20:39	00:20:40	Something I said?
268	00:20:40	00:20:41	Huh?
269	00:20:41	00:20:42	Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.
270	00:20:42	00:20:46	It was actually something I saw.
271	00:20:48	00:20:52	Veronica had been here since last summer.
272	00:20:52	00:20:54	Maybe six months.
273	00:20:54	00:20:55	We ran Ms. Juarez's social.
274	00:20:56	00:20:57	She wasn't an employee.
275	00:20:57	00:20:58	She was more of a freelancer.
276	00:20:58	00:21:01	The narcocorridos piece was her first major story.
277	00:21:01	00:21:04	Makes me sick to think she's not going to finish it.
278	00:21:04	00:21:05	She was working undercover?
279	00:21:05	00:21:09	She figured it was the only way to get these guys to open up to her.
280	00:21:09	00:21:10	She was right.
281	00:21:10	00:21:13	Yeah, her article came down pretty hard on the music, huh?
282	00:21:13	00:21:16	Narcocorridos glamorize a criminal lifestyle.
283	00:21:16	00:21:20	Veronica felt the songs were poisoning our young people.
284	00:21:20	00:21:23	She used the intern's desk right there.
285	00:21:35	00:21:38	I warned her that it was a vicious subculture.
286	00:21:38	00:21:39	Had she receive any threats?
287	00:21:39	00:21:43	Well, there was this one incident right after part one was published.
288	00:21:43	00:21:45	Nombre de Jesus Malverde...
289	00:21:45	00:21:47	Nombre de Jesus Malverde...
290	00:21:49	00:21:50	Silencio!
291	00:21:50	00:21:52	We didn't call the cops, but it was unsettling.
292	00:21:52	00:21:54	I'm kind of superstitious.
293	00:21:59	00:22:02	Good thing Veronica wasn't.
294	00:22:44	00:22:46	Hello?
295	00:22:49	00:22:51	LVPD.
296	00:22:55	00:22:56	Anyone here?
297	00:23:12	00:23:15	Elindio Zapata.
298	00:23:15	00:23:17	Elindio Zapata.
299	00:23:19	00:23:20	No hablo ingles.
300	00:23:21	00:23:22	Oh, de veras?
301	00:23:22	00:23:26	Well, that's funny, because the Border Patrol said you spoke perfect English.
302	00:23:30	00:23:32	We're going to take a look around, coyote.
303	00:23:34	00:23:37	You break it, you bought it.
304	00:23:51	00:23:52	Vayate.
305	00:23:52	00:23:55	That belongs to Jesus Malverde.
306	00:24:24	00:24:25	What do you got?
307	00:24:25	00:24:28	Veronica Juarez had a jacket just like this one.
308	00:24:28	00:24:29	Minus the tire tracks.
309	00:24:32	00:24:34	This jacket?
310	00:24:34	00:24:36	It's coming with me.
311	00:24:36	00:24:37	And you're going with him.
312	00:24:41	00:24:44	We know that you went to the newspaper office and you threatened her.
313	00:24:44	00:24:46	Si, señor.
314	00:24:46	00:24:49	I went to the oficina.
315	00:24:49	00:24:56	Her mentals were going places they need not. You want to tell me what this is?
316	00:24:57	00:24:59	Pollo bone.
317	00:24:59	00:25:02	Religious. ( chuckles )
318	00:25:02	00:25:05	My right in America.
319	00:25:05	00:25:07	I don't know, it looks more like a human finger to me.
320	00:25:07	00:25:10	It's been burned.
321	00:25:10	00:25:13	Eyes can fool you.
322	00:25:13	00:25:16	That's right. That's why I do a lot of tests.
323	00:25:16	00:25:20	And I'm also gonna match the blood found on Veronica's jacket right here.
324	00:25:21	00:25:24	I know nothing about this.
325	00:25:24	00:25:28	Nice... muchacho gave it to me.
326	00:25:28	00:25:29	¿Como se llama?
327	00:25:29	00:25:32	Don't know name, only...
328	00:25:32	00:25:35	face.
329	00:25:35	00:25:37	Cara.
330	00:25:40	00:25:43	Mm, people give me things all the time.
331	00:25:44	00:25:45	Now, why would they do that?
332	00:25:45	00:25:48	Maybe they like me.
333	00:25:49	00:25:52	Or for proteccion.
334	00:25:53	00:25:59	When you look at me, you see un hombre pobre, sucio.
335	00:25:59	00:26:02	Poor, dirty man.
336	00:26:02	00:26:04	Pero soy mas.
337	00:26:04	00:26:06	I am much more.
338	00:26:07	00:26:10	I am descendent...
339	00:26:10	00:26:12	of Jesus Malverde.
340	00:26:12	00:26:14	God...
341	00:26:14	00:26:16	Dios.
342	00:26:16	00:26:19	Angel of the poor.
343	00:26:19	00:26:24	The Mexican Robin Hood, a thief and a killer, hung May 3, 1909.
344	00:26:24	00:26:27	He is the reason...
345	00:26:27	00:26:29	you cannot touch me.
346	00:26:30	00:26:34	No me puedes tocar.
347	00:26:34	00:26:36	You're a disgrace to our community.
348	00:26:36	00:26:40	You're a greedy fence who will do or say anything to make a buck.
349	00:26:40	00:26:42	No, señor.
350	00:26:42	00:26:49	No, I may warn, I may protect, I may harm, I may do many things.
351	00:26:49	00:26:51	But not for money.
352	00:26:51	00:26:55	Okay, hold out your hands-- we're gonna get some prints.
353	00:27:23	00:27:26	You got lucky with the blood-stained lapel.
354	00:27:26	00:27:29	I didn't match the vic, but I got a hit in CODIS.
355	00:27:29	00:27:31	Great.
356	00:27:31	00:27:36	Dax Blanchard? Assault and battery against a police officer in '96.
357	00:27:36	00:27:39	Served two years. No current address.
358	00:27:39	00:27:41	Thanks.
359	00:27:45	00:27:46	Detective Jim Brass.
360	00:27:47	00:27:49	Congratulations, Jim Brass.
361	00:27:49	00:27:52	You're guaranteed one of these five amazing awards.
362	00:27:52	00:27:53	Trip to London, Warrick?
363	00:27:53	00:27:59	a brand-new Caddy, tennis bracelet, plasma TV, water purification system.
364	00:27:59	00:28:00	You finally did it, Jim.
365	00:28:00	00:28:04	Just send NZA a check for $300 and claim your prize.
366	00:28:04	00:28:07	NZA. So, where'd you get the sales pitch, man?
367	00:28:07	00:28:09	From the victim's personal effects.
368	00:28:09	00:28:13	My guess, it's the same boob who was calling Bonnie.
369	00:28:13	00:28:17	The company's address was on the old lady's boxes.
370	00:28:20	00:28:22	( all talking ) Mrs. Mason, I am standing, which means what?
371	00:28:22	00:28:25	You should be sitting. That's right, because I've got some great news. You just won a Cadillac.
372	00:28:25	00:28:27	Well, does your husband drive?
373	00:28:27	00:28:29	Have you ever shopped on 5th Avenue?
374	00:28:30	00:28:33	Come on. Look, I've been waiting my whole life to make this call.
375	00:28:33	00:28:35	Yes. Yes. Well, as soon as we get that...
376	00:28:35	00:28:37	Come on, people! Let's close these deals!
377	00:28:37	00:28:39	I got a room full of pikers or closers?
378	00:28:39	00:28:43	My grandmother used to say if it sounds too good to be true, it is.
379	00:28:44	00:28:45	Only closers go on that board.
380	00:28:47	00:28:49	Can I help you gentlemen?
381	00:28:49	00:28:53	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police, and this is Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab-- we got a couple of questions.
382	00:28:53	00:28:57	We know Vincent DeCarlo's not available-- how about Dax Blanchard?
383	00:28:57	00:29:01	Corner cubicle, burgundy tie.
384	00:29:01	00:29:02	You were?
385	00:29:02	00:29:04	You know what I want you to do, Harry?
386	00:29:04	00:29:07	I want you to stand up, and I want you to march over to that checkbook, soldier.
387	00:29:07	00:29:09	It does not sound like you're standing up to me, Harry.
388	00:29:09	00:29:10	You know why we're doing this, Harry?
389	00:29:10	00:29:12	Because we have something called trust, you and me.
390	00:29:12	00:29:13	You trust...
391	00:29:15	00:29:18	Harry, I need you to do me a favor, though, okay?
392	00:29:18	00:29:21	I need you to hang on for me for one second, okay?
393	00:29:21	00:29:23	Okay. You're the greatest.
394	00:29:23	00:29:26	Dax, at yakety-yak, you're the greatest.
395	00:29:26	00:29:28	I got a one-time-only offer for you.
396	00:29:28	00:29:30	Should we talk about it here or downtown?
397	00:29:30	00:29:32	Come on, what is this? This is a legal room.
398	00:29:32	00:29:34	What the hell is that?
399	00:29:35	00:29:36	Are you packing?
400	00:29:39	00:29:40	This a legal gun?
401	00:29:41	00:29:42	Yeah, it is. Registered to me.
402	00:29:42	00:29:45	Okay. Downtown it is.
403	00:29:45	00:29:46	Let's go.
404	00:29:49	00:29:51	Nine-millimeter.
405	00:29:51	00:29:54	Same as the casings found on the scene.
406	00:29:54	00:29:56	Nothing I'm doing is illegal.
407	00:29:56	00:30:02	In exchange for a small fee, my customers get one of five specified prizes.
408	00:30:02	00:30:04	When was the last time someone won a Cadillac?
409	00:30:04	00:30:07	While ago.
410	00:30:07	00:30:09	Long time ago.
411	00:30:09	00:30:11	Never, all right?
412	00:30:11	00:30:13	Look, I'm only obligated to give one of the prizes.
413	00:30:14	00:30:16	Nothing says it can't be the cheap one.
414	00:30:16	00:30:19	Apparently, you're very good at your job, but you're not the best.
415	00:30:19	00:30:21	I saw the board-- you're number two.
416	00:30:21	00:30:22	Right behind a dead guy.
417	00:30:22	00:30:23	Vinny's dead?
418	00:30:23	00:30:24	When was the last time you saw him?
419	00:30:26	00:30:29	Yesterday morning. We found your blood on his jacket.
420	00:30:29	00:30:33	Good. 'Cause I thought maybe I missed.
421	00:30:33	00:30:36	I got a room full of people congratulating you here, Dorothy.
422	00:30:36	00:30:39	Yeah, Dorothy! Yeah!
423	00:30:39	00:30:40	I...
424	00:30:40	00:30:42	What in the friggin' hell?
425	00:30:42	00:30:44	I had a live one.
426	00:30:44	00:30:46	You sold my grandmother, you son of a bitch.
427	00:30:46	00:30:47	Took every last cent.
428	00:30:47	00:30:50	Everybody we sell is someone's grandmother.
429	00:30:58	00:31:00	The guy was a mook, all right?
430	00:31:00	00:31:04	He was constantly stealing my leads, stealing my customers.
431	00:31:04	00:31:06	Then I find out he rips off my grandmother?
432	00:31:07	00:31:08	Honor among thieves?
433	00:31:08	00:31:12	For crap's sake, she's living in a nursing home, confined to a wheelchair.
434	00:31:12	00:31:19	So you killed Vincent DeCarlo because he was better than you, because he stole your leads, because he sold your bubby Bonnie, and you wanted him out of the way.
435	00:31:20	00:31:22	Who the hell's Bonnie?
436	00:31:22	00:31:24	Your grandmother.
437	00:31:24	00:31:25	Bonnie Bakerset.
438	00:31:25	00:31:28	My grandmother's name is Fran.
439	00:31:28	00:31:29	She lives in Daytona Beach.
440	00:31:29	00:31:31	Would you like to call her?
441	00:32:11	00:32:13	Hey, Catherine.
442	00:32:13	00:32:20	The palm prints on the newspaper don't match Elindio's. Well, that just means he didn't place the head in the box.
443	00:32:20	00:32:23	The vic's blood was on the jacket in his store.
444	00:32:23	00:32:31	She was run over by a Toyo Open Country MT 38-by-15.5-by-18.
445	00:32:33	00:32:34	Now, that's a big-ass truck tire.
446	00:32:35	00:32:37	Elindio didn't even own a car, much less a big-ass truck.
447	00:32:37	00:32:38	What other characteristics?
448	00:32:38	00:32:41	Take a look.
449	00:32:42	00:32:44	That's a retread.
450	00:32:47	00:32:50	I only know of one place in Vegas that does work like this.
451	00:32:50	00:32:53	So, what is it you need?
452	00:32:53	00:32:57	Invoice copies of any retreads that were done on this type of tire.
453	00:32:57	00:33:00	Oh, yeah. We sell about a hundred of these a month.
454	00:33:00	00:33:02	Really? Yeah.
455	00:33:02	00:33:03	Over here.
456	00:33:03	00:33:04	Thank you.
457	00:33:11	00:33:13	Hey.
458	00:33:15	00:33:17	I'll take that autograph now.
459	00:33:19	00:33:21	Ven aca.
460	00:33:24	00:33:25	I was seeing Carla...
461	00:33:25	00:33:29	until Veronica Juarez's article came out.
462	00:33:29	00:33:32	I figured out who she was.
463	00:33:32	00:33:33	And then?
464	00:33:34	00:33:36	Then I dumped her ass.
465	00:33:36	00:33:37	What do you think?
466	00:33:37	00:33:44	She put down my music, my band, made it look like everyone involved in narcocorridos was a drug dealer or a criminal.
467	00:33:46	00:33:47	She lied to me.
468	00:33:48	00:33:49	¿Asi es como pagas?
469	00:33:53	00:33:55	Narcocorridos are entertainment.
470	00:33:55	00:34:02	The drugs, they're an economic activity woven in the fabric of Sinaloan history.
471	00:34:02	00:34:04	The music does nothing more than reflect that.
472	00:34:04	00:34:08	Narcocorridos also depicts actual events.
473	00:34:08	00:34:09	00 news.
474	00:34:09	00:34:15	A lot of people were pissed off when she wrote that trash. So you're saying that she deserved to die?
475	00:34:15	00:34:24	I'm saying she was a two-faced bitch who got off on our music at night, wrote about how disgusting we were during the day, when she was the one smoking and snorting, screwing everything she could find.
476	00:34:24	00:34:26	We tested her blood.
477	00:34:26	00:34:28	We know that Miss Juarez didn't do drugs.
478	00:34:28	00:34:32	And... I seriously doubt that she was having sex with you.
479	00:34:32	00:34:35	Listen...
480	00:34:35	00:34:37	I didn't kill Veronica.
481	00:34:37	00:34:42	But she was a pocha, a traitor, and people like that aren't taken lightly in Sinaloa.
482	00:34:42	00:34:45	We're not in Sinaloa.
483	00:34:45	00:34:48	When you're inside La Hacienda Corona, you might as well be.
484	00:35:10	00:35:13	Deutschland uber alles...
485	00:35:16	00:35:18	I identified the casings recovered at the scene.
486	00:35:18	00:35:20	They don't match Dax Blanchard's 9-mil.
487	00:35:20	00:35:22	So, did he have any other firearms?
488	00:35:22	00:35:23	Nothing registered.
489	00:35:23	00:35:27	Well, head stamp on the casings was a little unusual.
490	00:35:28	00:35:30	DWM?
491	00:35:31	00:35:33	Deutsche Waffen und Munitions fabrik.
492	00:35:33	00:35:36	Well, that's World War II-era German.
493	00:35:36	00:35:42	Well, it's one thing to collect old guns; old ammunition comes from a trophy-- an enemy gun a soldier brings back from battle.
494	00:35:42	00:35:45	So, our shooter's an old soldier.
495	00:35:46	00:35:48	Hmm.
496	00:35:48	00:35:51	Bonnie had Alzheimer's, you know.
497	00:35:51	00:35:56	And that son of a monster sold her twice a day.
498	00:35:56	00:36:03	Once in the morning, and again that night, because...
499	00:36:03	00:36:07	he knew she had forgot that she bought the first time.
500	00:36:07	00:36:13	I tried to talk her out of it, but Vincent just kept on calling.
501	00:36:13	00:36:16	And Bonnie just kept on a-buying.
502	00:36:17	00:36:18	So, what did you do about it, sir?
503	00:36:18	00:36:20	Huh?
504	00:36:20	00:36:21	What'd you do about it?
505	00:36:24	00:36:28	Vincent started calling all of us.
506	00:36:28	00:36:32	I played along.
507	00:36:32	00:36:36	I told him I didn't have a checking account, so the bastard offered to drive me to the bank.
508	00:36:36	00:36:40	I wanted him to think that I was weak.
509	00:36:40	00:36:45	So I borrowed Bonnie's wheelchair.
510	00:36:45	00:36:46	Drove me to the bank.
511	00:36:47	00:36:49	Pushed me right up to the teller.
512	00:36:49	00:36:51	Oh, he was helpful.
513	00:36:53	00:36:56	And then he drove me back to the casino.
514	00:36:56	00:36:58	Why did you have him park on the roof?
515	00:37:00	00:37:02	Why not?
516	00:37:02	00:37:05	Nobody parks on the roof.
517	00:37:05	00:37:06	Here we go.
518	00:37:06	00:37:07	Now all we need is the money.
519	00:37:07	00:37:11	( yelling ) Would've killed him with one shot. Lousy shakes.
520	00:37:13	00:37:16	But I got him good the second one.
521	00:37:16	00:37:20	Been a long time since I had to kill someone.
522	00:37:20	00:37:22	Where's your sidearm, sir?
523	00:37:35	00:37:37	You know, the world has changed.
524	00:37:37	00:37:43	When I was serving my country, I knew who my enemy was.
525	00:37:47	00:37:49	The gun, please, sir.
526	00:37:49	00:37:52	Now the enemy is...
527	00:37:52	00:37:56	some punk... calls you up on the telephone...
528	00:37:56	00:38:01	and wants your credit card number.
529	00:38:01	00:38:03	Sir?
530	00:38:03	00:38:05	The gun.
531	00:38:08	00:38:10	Hmm.
532	00:38:45	00:38:46	Bad news.
533	00:38:46	00:38:49	Rafael's palm prints don't match the one on the newspaper.
534	00:38:50	00:38:56	Worse news, his tire treads don't match the ones on Veronica Juarez's leather jacket, either.
535	00:38:56	00:38:58	Great.
536	00:38:58	00:39:05	Well, you know, there is one place the victim was where there's a whole lot of these tires.
537	00:39:28	00:39:30	Vega!
538	00:39:34	00:39:36	What do you think?
539	00:39:36	00:39:37	Run the plates.
540	00:39:44	00:39:45	Hey, Juanito.
541	00:39:45	00:39:47	Not barbacking tonight?
542	00:39:48	00:39:50	No, I got the night off. I'm gonna go party today.
543	00:39:50	00:39:53	So, you guys, uh, still looking for Carla?
544	00:39:53	00:39:54	No.
545	00:39:54	00:39:55	No? No, we're looking for you.
546	00:39:55	00:39:58	Do you own a 2004 Ford F-150?
547	00:39:58	00:39:59	Gray with panting on it?
548	00:39:59	00:40:02	Uh, yeah, that's the full-blown cocino mobile.
549	00:40:02	00:40:03	Oh, your pig mobile, nice name.
550	00:40:03	00:40:05	Yeah.
551	00:40:07	00:40:10	That's a cool belt, Juanito.
552	00:40:10	00:40:12	What's it made out of?
553	00:40:12	00:40:14	Human hair? Ooh, um...
554	00:40:14	00:40:16	You guys want me to show you?
555	00:40:16	00:40:20	( grunts ) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Muevanse, muevanse por atras!
556	00:40:20	00:40:21	Muevan... muevanse por atras!
557	00:40:21	00:40:23	Hey, hey, hey, back up!
558	00:40:26	00:40:30	Calmense, todos. Dejanos hacer nuestro trabajo y no les vamos a molestar.
559	00:40:31	00:40:33	Calmense, ya! Este muchacho mato a una señorita inocente.
560	00:40:33	00:40:35	Inocente!
561	00:40:35	00:40:36	Calmense.
562	00:40:36	00:40:37	Ya.
563	00:40:37	00:40:39	Y tiene que pagar.
564	00:40:40	00:40:41	Y tiene que pagar!
565	00:40:41	00:40:42	Get him out of here! Ya!
566	00:40:43	00:40:43	Go, go, go!
567	00:40:52	00:40:54	I don't understand you, Juanito.
568	00:40:54	00:40:57	You manage to stay out of the gangs, drugs.
569	00:40:58	00:40:59	Making honest money...
570	00:40:59	00:41:01	What? Seven dollars an hour?
571	00:41:02	00:41:04	Hey, it's better than the joint.
572	00:41:04	00:41:06	I can promise you that.
573	00:41:06	00:41:08	Besides, you didn't prove anything...
574	00:41:08	00:41:11	taking the life of an innocent woman...
575	00:41:11	00:41:13	It was the perfect opportunity, bro...
576	00:41:14	00:41:15	Yeah? To do what?
577	00:41:15	00:41:20	Impress a bunch of fools who don't give a crap about what happens to you, anyway.
578	00:41:29	00:41:31	Immortality, bro.
579	00:41:31	00:41:36	See, I-I'm not gonna die a barback, or a dishwasher...
580	00:41:36	00:41:37	Mm-mmm.
581	00:41:37	00:41:39	You're gonna get the needle, kid.
582	00:41:39	00:41:41	You're gonna die a murderer.
583	00:41:41	00:41:45	Yeah, maybe so, but they're gonna write a song about me.
584	00:41:45	00:41:47	I'm gonna go down in history.
585	00:41:47	00:41:48	No, no, no, no.
586	00:41:49	00:41:51	You see, the song's already been written.
587	00:41:52	00:41:54	You're just a sad copy.
588	00:41:54	00:41:56	Una copia triste.
589	00:41:56	00:41:59	Well, I gave it my own twist, though.
590	00:41:59	00:42:03	Uh... 'cause I-I'm an original.
591	00:42:04	00:42:05	Right.
592	00:42:29	00:42:30	Limpia...
593	00:42:30	00:42:32	esta puta!
594	00:42:49	00:42:50	Immortal.
