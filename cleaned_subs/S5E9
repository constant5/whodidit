0,00:00:05,00:00:08,JEFFREY SINCLAIR: I need you to answer the same questions I asked you at the first trial.
1,00:00:08,00:00:11,"And I need you to answer them honestly, just as you did back then."
2,00:00:11,00:00:17,"On December 20, 1999, you responded to a call at 2028 Boulder Highway. Is that correct?"
3,00:00:17,00:00:18,Yes.
4,00:00:18,00:00:19,Can you describe the crime scene?
5,00:00:19,00:00:21,It was a hardware store.
6,00:00:21,00:00:22,I entered through the back door.
7,00:00:26,00:00:28,The victim had been severely beaten.
8,00:00:28,00:00:31,And our forensics determined that the murder weapon was a wrench.
9,00:00:31,00:00:34,Exhibit A.
10,00:00:34,00:00:37,Do you recognize this object?
11,00:00:37,00:00:40,Yes. I bagged and processed this wrench.
12,00:00:40,00:00:42,My initials are on the seal.
13,00:00:42,00:00:43,Where did you find it?
14,00:00:43,00:00:49,"It was in a toolbox under the kitchen sink at Garbett's Gourmet, which is a restaurant next to the crime scene."
15,00:00:49,00:00:52,"Now, are you certain that this wrench was used to kill the victim?"
16,00:00:52,00:00:54,Yes. We found trace blood in the metal grooves.
17,00:00:54,00:00:57,And the DNA matched the victim's.
18,00:00:57,00:00:59,"What, if anything, did you find on the handle?"
19,00:00:59,00:01:01,"We found the defendant, Mr. Garbett's fingerprints."
20,00:01:01,00:01:04,We also found his prints at the hardware store.
21,00:01:11,00:01:13,What else did you find at the store?
22,00:01:13,00:01:24,"GRISSOM: Well, it appeared that the killer tried to cover his tracks by setting a fire, a lack of sufficient combustibles may have thwarted his effort."
23,00:01:24,00:01:25,Dr. Grissom.
24,00:01:25,00:01:27,Exhibit B.
25,00:01:27,00:01:30,Do you recognize this?
26,00:01:30,00:01:32,Yes. It's a matchbook.
27,00:01:32,00:01:35,Did you find this matchbook at the scene?
28,00:01:39,00:01:46,"Dr. Grissom, just so we can be clear, this is the matchbook that you found at the crime scene."
29,00:01:46,00:01:47,Is that correct?
30,00:01:50,00:01:52,"Your Honor, may I take a short break?"
31,00:01:52,00:01:55,Um... prosecution requests a ten-minute recess.
32,00:01:55,00:01:58,The defense asks that Dr. Grissom answer the question now.
33,00:01:58,00:02:01,"Answer the question, then we'll break."
34,00:02:01,00:02:04,"Yes, this is the matchbook I collected at the crime scene."
35,00:02:04,00:02:06,"All right, we'll take a ten-minute recess."
36,00:02:07,00:02:10,"So, you wanna tell me what this is all about?"
37,00:02:10,00:02:13,"Grissom, the defendant was found guilty at his first trial."
38,00:02:13,00:02:20,The only reason we're back in court is because his new lawyer convinced some appellate judge the original jury instructions were faulty.
39,00:02:20,00:02:22,This has nothing to do with the evidence.
40,00:02:22,00:02:23,(sighs)
41,00:02:23,00:02:25,There's a fingerprint on this matchbook.
42,00:02:25,00:02:27,So?
43,00:02:27,00:02:30,I don't remember it.
44,00:02:30,00:02:33,It's not in my notes.
45,00:02:33,00:02:34,The evidence seal isn't broken.
46,00:02:34,00:02:36,"If the print's there now, it was there before."
47,00:02:36,00:02:39,GRISSOM: The defendant's fingerprints are all loop patterns.
48,00:02:43,00:02:45,This is an arch.
49,00:02:45,00:02:47,It's not a match.
50,00:02:47,00:02:49,This is not the defendant's print.
51,00:02:49,00:02:51,Are you sure?
52,00:02:57,00:03:02,"You know, when the defense hears about this, they are going to call every other piece of evidence into question."
53,00:03:02,00:03:05,I don't need to tell you what that means.
54,00:03:06,00:03:09,I've given them reasonable doubt.
55,00:03:45,00:03:46,Heard we have a problem.
56,00:03:47,00:03:48,The Middle East has a problem.
57,00:03:48,00:03:51,You missed a fingerprint on a key piece of evidence.
58,00:03:51,00:03:53,I'm trying to keep an open mind.
59,00:03:53,00:03:54,Then how do you explain it?
60,00:03:54,00:03:55,"At the moment, I can't."
61,00:03:56,00:03:57,Could someone have substituted a different matchbook?
62,00:03:58,00:04:00,"Well, the evidence seal wasn't broken."
63,00:04:00,00:04:03,The matchbook's appearance is consistent with the crime scene photos.
64,00:04:03,00:04:09,"Since your original testimony differs from the actual physical evidence, I thought I'd inform you I've opened a supervisory inquiry."
65,00:04:10,00:04:13,"Well, that's good, Conrad."
66,00:04:13,00:04:16,"You know, I can't recall a lab director as expeditious as you."
67,00:04:16,00:04:17,"(gunshot, glass shatters)"
68,00:04:21,00:04:22,"You okay, Bobby?"
69,00:04:22,00:04:23,Been better.
70,00:04:23,00:04:24,What the hell happened?
71,00:04:24,00:04:27,I was about to test-fire the Mac-10 when it accidentally discharged.
72,00:04:27,00:04:29,Don't know how it happened.
73,00:04:29,00:04:32,Should've been more careful.
74,00:04:32,00:04:34,"Whose, uh, whose case you working?"
75,00:04:34,00:04:35,Uh...
76,00:04:36,00:04:38,Sara Sidle and Greg Sanders.
77,00:04:38,00:04:42,Gun was found next to a dead body at an off-Strip parking lot.
78,00:04:42,00:04:44,All right. Make sure you file a report.
79,00:04:44,00:04:45,"Yes, sir."
80,00:04:45,00:04:46,Everybody back to work.
81,00:04:48,00:04:49,Just keep me posted.
82,00:04:52,00:04:53,WILLOWS: I remember this case.
83,00:04:53,00:04:57,The Garbetts owned a restaurant that was next door to the victim's hardware store.
84,00:04:57,00:05:02,Max Larson owned the private alleyway that was behind both places.
85,00:05:02,00:05:03,STOKES: That's right.
86,00:05:03,00:05:05,He blocked the alleyway with a Dumpster.
87,00:05:11,00:05:13,"Yeah, the guy was a jerk."
88,00:05:13,00:05:15,"Well, he claimed the restaurant's delivery trucks were clogging the alley."
89,00:05:15,00:05:18,BROWN: Didn't the Garbetts sue to have the Dumpster removed?
90,00:05:18,00:05:19,GRISSOM: They lost.
91,00:05:19,00:05:21,There was no easement in their title.
92,00:05:21,00:05:25,"WILLOWS: And without access for deliveries, the restaurant business just dried up."
93,00:05:25,00:05:28,GRISSOM: All the physical evidence pointed to Garbett.
94,00:05:28,00:05:33,"And according to the victim's business partner, Garbett had an argument with the victim the day before the murder."
95,00:05:33,00:05:36,Garbett's appeal didn't call the forensics into question.
96,00:05:36,00:05:38,Why are we here?
97,00:05:38,00:05:39,I'm calling the forensics into question.
98,00:05:40,00:05:42,I printed this matchbook.
99,00:05:42,00:05:43,There was no print.
100,00:05:44,00:05:46,Take a look at it now.
101,00:05:49,00:05:53,"WILLOWS: Well, the fingerprint's pink-- so you used Ninhydrin?"
102,00:05:53,00:05:54,Mm-hmm.
103,00:05:56,00:05:59,"Well, I know that on some surfaces, Ninhydrin can take time to develop a print."
104,00:05:59,00:06:03,"It was in, uh, last May'sJournal of Forensic Sciences."
105,00:06:03,00:06:04,I remember the article.
106,00:06:04,00:06:09,But I can't remember whether the variables in the test case are consistent with ours.
107,00:06:09,00:06:12,"Well, if the print matches the suspect, who cares?"
108,00:06:12,00:06:13,It doesn't match.
109,00:06:14,00:06:20,"So, you and Warrick take over the file-- make sure all of the other evidence is beyond reproach. Catherine, you supervise."
110,00:06:20,00:06:25,"To avoid any appearance of impropriety, I'm going to be hands off."
111,00:06:28,00:06:30,(knock on door)
112,00:06:30,00:06:31,Sofia.
113,00:06:31,00:06:37,You do know that theJournal's back issues are available on-line.
114,00:06:37,00:06:39,The lab has a password.
115,00:06:39,00:06:42,"When you read from a computer screen, you have to lean in."
116,00:06:42,00:06:43,I like to lean back.
117,00:06:43,00:06:45,"Therefore, I prefer a hard copy."
118,00:06:48,00:06:49,Is this what your looking for?
119,00:06:54,00:06:56,GRISSOM: May.
120,00:06:56,00:06:58,Yes. Thank you.
121,00:07:00,00:07:03,News travels so fast around here.
122,00:07:03,00:07:06,Ecklie travels fast.
123,00:07:07,00:07:15,"Look, in case you're not up-to-date on your QA/QC memos, I've been the lab's quality control officer for the past year."
124,00:07:15,00:07:17,Congratulations.
125,00:07:17,00:07:21,That job requires a detail-oriented person.
126,00:07:21,00:07:24,"Grissom, I've been assigned to your inquiry."
127,00:07:25,00:07:27,I just wanted to give you the heads-up.
128,00:07:27,00:07:28,I'll be impartial.
129,00:07:29,00:07:31,I'd expect nothing less.
130,00:07:33,00:07:35,Margaritaville?
131,00:07:40,00:07:43,"That is still the lab's password, right?"
132,00:07:50,00:07:55,"Warrick, in your field report, you documented the collection of several hairs near the body, but DNA never analyzed them."
133,00:07:55,00:08:02,"Well, the DA had sufficient evidence and filed charges before I could give the hair to Greg, so I moved on to another case."
134,00:08:02,00:08:03,Process the hairs now.
135,00:08:03,00:08:04,Yeah.
136,00:08:04,00:08:07,"Catherine, do you remember why you were late to this crime scene?"
137,00:08:09,00:08:12,Eddie had a gig and you couldn't find a baby-sitter.
138,00:08:12,00:08:14,"Actually, I kind of made that up."
139,00:08:14,00:08:15,Eddie did have a gig.
140,00:08:16,00:08:19,It ended early and he and I...
141,00:08:20,00:08:23,"Well, let's just say that not all my memories of him are bad ones."
142,00:08:23,00:08:30,"Which reminds me you, at the time, were going out with that assistant manager of the Flamingo."
143,00:08:30,00:08:32,"Oh, Susan."
144,00:08:32,00:08:33,"Boy, did she have it bad for you."
145,00:08:33,00:08:34,She kept calling while we were working the scene.
146,00:08:34,00:08:36,You had to shut your phone off.
147,00:08:36,00:08:40,"Yeah, well, now she's VP of Food Services, so I get free steak and eggs every Sunday morning."
148,00:08:40,00:08:43,Free steak and eggs means she didn't know about the flight attendant.
149,00:08:43,00:08:45,Does everyone know my business around here?
150,00:08:45,00:08:53,"WILLOWS: Okay, Nicky, since you have such a good memory, why don't you explain the unidentified prints that you lifted from the murder weapon."
151,00:08:53,00:08:56,I lifted six prints off the wrench.
152,00:08:56,00:08:57,I ran them through I-AFIS.
153,00:08:57,00:08:58,Five were a match to the suspect.
154,00:08:58,00:09:00,One was unidentified.
155,00:09:00,00:09:06,"Now, at the time, we all agreed that that print was irrelevant, because the wrench was found in the common area."
156,00:09:06,00:09:10,"Okay, well, we're going to have to compare that unidentified print with this matchbook print."
157,00:09:11,00:09:12,Will do.
158,00:09:13,00:09:14,"Hey, Catherine..."
159,00:09:15,00:09:17,...we didn't do anything wrong here.
160,00:09:17,00:09:19,I agree.
161,00:09:19,00:09:21,But the prosecution may not see it that way.
162,00:09:26,00:09:27,"Hey, how's Bobby doing?"
163,00:09:27,00:09:29,"Shaken, but working hard."
164,00:09:29,00:09:31,Trying to figure out why the gun discharged.
165,00:09:31,00:09:34,"ROBBINS: Well, fortunately, Bobby dodged his bullet-- unlike our victim."
166,00:09:34,00:09:38,C.O.D's a single gunshot wound to the leg.
167,00:09:38,00:09:40,And it severed the femoral artery.
168,00:09:40,00:09:41,We processed the guy's jeans.
169,00:09:41,00:09:43,Tight GSR pattern around the entrance hole.
170,00:09:43,00:09:47,"SIDLE: So, he was either shot by someone at close range who left the gun behind, or it was self-inflicted."
171,00:09:47,00:09:50,Why would the shooter leave the gun behind?
172,00:09:50,00:09:51,He probably wouldn't.
173,00:09:51,00:09:54,ROBBINS: And most suicides are through the torso or through the head.
174,00:09:54,00:09:56,So if it wasn't intentional...
175,00:09:56,00:09:57,It was accidental.
176,00:09:57,00:09:59,Greg...
177,00:09:59,00:10:03,insert this rod into the hole.
178,00:10:12,00:10:15,Trajectory is up to down.
179,00:10:15,00:10:17,"Consistent with a self-inflicted, accidental injury."
180,00:10:18,00:10:18,(gunshot)
181,00:10:18,00:10:19,(groaning)
182,00:10:21,00:10:23,Have you been able to I.D. him?
183,00:10:23,00:10:24,No wallet.
184,00:10:24,00:10:25,Prints didn't hit.
185,00:10:25,00:10:26,No relatives came forward.
186,00:10:26,00:10:30,"So, I'm calling him John Doe Number 124."
187,00:10:41,00:10:42,(beeping)
188,00:10:54,00:10:59,(beeping)
189,00:11:01,00:11:02,A perfect match.
190,00:11:02,00:11:05,Someone other than the suspect touched the matches and the wrench.
191,00:11:05,00:11:11,The wrench was found in a toolbox in the suspect's restaurant.
192,00:11:11,00:11:13,The murder happened after closing.
193,00:11:13,00:11:16,Who else had access to that restaurant?
194,00:11:16,00:11:18,STOKES: Mrs. Garbett.
195,00:11:18,00:11:21,"It's, uh, Mrs. Katz now. I remarried."
196,00:11:21,00:11:23,"Oh, okay-- Mrs. Katz. Duly noted."
197,00:11:23,00:11:25,"Please, have a seat."
198,00:11:25,00:11:28,I appreciate you coming down here and meeting with me.
199,00:11:28,00:11:30,"Look, my ex-husband called me from jail."
200,00:11:30,00:11:32,I know about the new trial.
201,00:11:32,00:11:35,But this case has nothing to do with me.
202,00:11:36,00:11:37,Not anymore.
203,00:11:37,00:11:39,He got a life sentence.
204,00:11:39,00:11:41,The crime lab testified.
205,00:11:41,00:11:43,You think he's guilty?
206,00:11:43,00:11:46,(sighs)
207,00:11:46,00:11:48,Jason was a quiet man.
208,00:11:48,00:11:50,Bottled everything up.
209,00:11:50,00:12:00,"In 25 years of marriage, he raised his voice... maybe... a dozen times."
210,00:12:00,00:12:04,But when he expressed himself...
211,00:12:04,00:12:06,the neighborhood knew.
212,00:12:06,00:12:09,"Mom, I got your voice mail."
213,00:12:09,00:12:10,Keith.
214,00:12:10,00:12:11,What's going on?
215,00:12:11,00:12:13,"Uh, Mr. Stokes is with the crime lab."
216,00:12:13,00:12:14,Hi.
217,00:12:14,00:12:17,"Look, we'll help in any way we can."
218,00:12:19,00:12:24,What I'd really like to do is get a list of anyone who had access to that restaurant five years ago.
219,00:12:24,00:12:25,KEITH: Sure.
220,00:12:25,00:12:27,May I ask why?
221,00:12:27,00:12:30,Recent evidence has come to light...
222,00:12:30,00:12:31,What evidence?
223,00:12:31,00:12:32,"Oh, now that I can't discuss."
224,00:12:32,00:12:34,My father's innocent.
225,00:12:34,00:12:37,My son has never stopped believing in his father.
226,00:12:37,00:12:44,"He has sacrificed everything for Jason: Moved back to Vegas, hired a new attorney, poured all his money into the appeal."
227,00:12:44,00:12:47,So you weren't living in town at the time of the murder?
228,00:12:47,00:12:48,"No, I was living in L.A."
229,00:12:48,00:12:50,"Oh, okay. Look..."
230,00:12:50,00:12:51,whatever you need from us...
231,00:12:53,00:12:54,Mom...?
232,00:12:55,00:12:56,Um...
233,00:12:56,00:12:59,I have some old records back at the house.
234,00:12:59,00:13:01,I could send them over.
235,00:13:01,00:13:03,"Yeah, that'd be great."
236,00:13:17,00:13:20,"(Avril Lavigne singing ""Don't Tell Me"")"
237,00:13:20,00:13:22,You're listening to music.
238,00:13:22,00:13:25,It was Greg's suggestion.
239,00:13:25,00:13:26,"No, it's good."
240,00:13:26,00:13:29,"Well, maybe not your music taste, but we'll work on that."
241,00:13:29,00:13:33,You have my DNA profile for the hair sample I gave you?
242,00:13:33,00:13:34,No.
243,00:13:34,00:13:37,No? Do you need more time?
244,00:13:37,00:13:40,No... the sample you sent me wasn't human...
245,00:13:40,00:13:41,so I sent it over to Trace.
246,00:13:41,00:13:44,Maybe Hodges can tell you something.
247,00:13:44,00:13:46,All right. Thank you.
248,00:13:46,00:13:53,"And Mia, Avril's fine, but if you really want to experience musical heartache, you should check out, uh... Nina Simone."
249,00:13:56,00:13:58,(song resumes)
250,00:14:54,00:14:57,"Grissom, Judge Witherspoon wants me in her chambers first thing in the morning."
251,00:14:57,00:14:59,"She's going to demand a full update, Gil."
252,00:15:00,00:15:03,I can't explain the appearance of the print on the matchbook.
253,00:15:03,00:15:05,That's what I'm trying to figure out.
254,00:15:05,00:15:08,You're making the lab look bad.
255,00:15:08,00:15:11,SINCLAIR: Word has it you've reopened the entire case.
256,00:15:11,00:15:14,An unexamined hair and an unidentified print on the murder weapon?
257,00:15:17,00:15:20,"Grissom, did we make a mistake and arrest the wrong guy?"
258,00:15:21,00:15:23,I don't know.
259,00:15:26,00:15:28,BRASS: Hey. We gotta talk.
260,00:15:28,00:15:31,Ecklie's used his hot line to the sheriff.
261,00:15:31,00:15:33,The whole department knows about the inquiry.
262,00:15:33,00:15:35,There's nothing I can do about that.
263,00:15:35,00:15:43,"Yeah, well, I want to give you a heads-up, 'cause here's how it's gonna break down: In order to appear objective, Ecklie's gonna follow Sofia's recommendations."
264,00:15:43,00:15:48,"The problem is, she's Acting Supervisor of Days, so she needs Ecklie to sign off to keep her gig."
265,00:15:48,00:15:52,And you think she'll say whatever Ecklie wants.
266,00:15:52,00:15:53,Yeah. And this isn't just about the Garbett case.
267,00:15:53,00:15:55,He's looking into your whole team.
268,00:15:55,00:15:57,And your ability to lead them.
269,00:15:58,00:15:59,Poor Conrad.
270,00:15:59,00:16:02,"I hate to tell you, but when it comes to politics, he whips your ass."
271,00:16:02,00:16:04,So watch your back; it's gonna get ugly.
272,00:16:04,00:16:07,Thanks.
273,00:16:07,00:16:08,HODGES: The hair on the right is a human hair.
274,00:16:09,00:16:11,The hair on the left is from your five- year-old crime scene.
275,00:16:11,00:16:16,"Given the big fat medulla, I'd say canine, and given its coarseness..."
276,00:16:16,00:16:20,I'd say it could be a poodle or a Portuguese Water Dog.
277,00:16:20,00:16:22,(laughing): What?! A Portuguese Water Dog.
278,00:16:22,00:16:24,Mm-hmm.
279,00:16:24,00:16:26,They were found on fishing vessels in the 1800s.
280,00:16:26,00:16:27,Are you serious?
281,00:16:27,00:16:30,"Warrick, I thought you were following it up with DNA."
282,00:16:30,00:16:32,I am. The hairs got kicked to Trace.
283,00:16:32,00:16:34,"HODGES: Yeah, they're from a dog."
284,00:16:34,00:16:35,Very obvious under the microscope.
285,00:16:37,00:16:40,I will find out if the victim or suspect owned a dog.
286,00:16:41,00:16:42,I'm on it.
287,00:16:42,00:16:44,Thanks.
288,00:16:45,00:16:47,Ecklie was so pissed when I told him about these hairs.
289,00:16:47,00:16:48,You told Ecklie?
290,00:16:48,00:16:49,Yeah. He's a friend.
291,00:16:50,00:16:52,I sent him a card for his promotion.
292,00:16:52,00:16:53,The guy was very touched by my thoughtfulness.
293,00:16:53,00:16:56,"Oh, we all are."
294,00:16:56,00:16:57,Oh.
295,00:16:57,00:16:58,Are you finished with the gun?
296,00:16:58,00:17:01,"Yeah, I figured out what caused that A.D."
297,00:17:01,00:17:04,Some garage gunsmith tried to turn this baby into a machine gun.
298,00:17:04,00:17:06,That is a big-time felony.
299,00:17:06,00:17:07,Not to mention dangerous.
300,00:17:07,00:17:08,"Here, take a look."
301,00:17:08,00:17:14,"See, the trip has been ground down, which prevents the bolt from locking back."
302,00:17:14,00:17:16,"(click, whoosh)"
303,00:17:17,00:17:20,(groaning loudly)
304,00:17:20,00:17:23,Vic never even pulled the trigger.
305,00:17:23,00:17:25,Did you get an I.D. off the serial number?
306,00:17:25,00:17:27,It's also ground down.
307,00:17:27,00:17:29,Nearly halfway through the metal.
308,00:17:29,00:17:31,"Well, I love a challenge."
309,00:17:32,00:17:34,"Well, it's all yours."
310,00:17:34,00:17:38,"STOKES: The Garbetts' restaurant employed six waiters, two cooks, and a busboy."
311,00:17:38,00:17:42,All of whom would've had access to the kitchen and to the wrench.
312,00:17:42,00:17:50,"Right: Garbett's ex-wife, three of the waiters and both cooks prints were in I-AFIS because of work cards, but none was a match to the mystery print."
313,00:17:50,00:17:51,And what about the other four?
314,00:17:51,00:17:53,I ran their socials to get their addresses.
315,00:17:53,00:17:56,"I'll grab a uniform, go bang on some doors."
316,00:18:06,00:18:07,Hi.
317,00:18:07,00:18:08,I'm Nick Stokes.
318,00:18:09,00:18:11,"Good day, sir. My name's Nick Stokes."
319,00:18:11,00:18:13,I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
320,00:18:13,00:18:16,I'm reinvestigating Max Larson's homicide.
321,00:18:16,00:18:19,"I was hoping to get your, uh, your fingerprints."
322,00:18:19,00:18:21,It would help eliminate you as a suspect.
323,00:18:28,00:18:30,"Thank you, ma'am."
324,00:18:30,00:18:32,Max didn't like dogs.
325,00:18:32,00:18:34,We don't allow them in the store.
326,00:18:34,00:18:36,"How about you, Mr. Reeba. Do you down a dog?"
327,00:18:36,00:18:39,No.
328,00:18:39,00:18:41,"Mr. Brown, what's this about?"
329,00:18:41,00:18:43,"I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to discuss ongoing cases."
330,00:18:43,00:18:45,"Look, I have a right to know."
331,00:18:45,00:18:47,Max was my business partner.
332,00:18:47,00:18:51,"Well, all I can tell you is that the defendant was granted a new trial."
333,00:18:51,00:18:53,Based on a friggin' technicality.
334,00:18:54,00:18:56,I talked to the D.A. myself.
335,00:18:56,00:18:58,The crime lab is reviewing the case file now.
336,00:18:58,00:19:00,Garbett killed Max.
337,00:19:00,00:19:03,I was right here when he tried to shake us down.
338,00:19:05,00:19:07,"If you don't move that Dumpster, I swear, I'm gonna kill you!"
339,00:19:07,00:19:09,Judge says I'm in the right. You can go to hell.
340,00:19:09,00:19:10,You're gonna regret this.
341,00:19:10,00:19:12,So tell me: how many customers did you have tonight?
342,00:19:13,00:19:14,"Hey, Rick..."
343,00:19:14,00:19:16,what's a number less than one?
344,00:19:17,00:19:18,This isn't over.
345,00:19:18,00:19:20,I guess he could've handled it better.
346,00:19:20,00:19:24,But Garbett's delivery trucks-- they were always blocking access to our parking lot.
347,00:19:24,00:19:28,"We complained-- he refused to do anything about it, so we exercised our legal rights."
348,00:19:29,00:19:30,A judge rules in our favor.
349,00:19:30,00:19:33,"Two days later, Max is murdered."
350,00:19:33,00:19:35,Can you imagine killing over an incident like this?
351,00:19:36,00:19:37,"I've seen people kill for a lot less, sir."
352,00:19:37,00:19:43,"Mr. Reeba, you and your partner were joint owners of this property, right?"
353,00:19:43,00:19:45,Yes.
354,00:19:45,00:19:46,With right of survivorship.
355,00:19:46,00:19:51,"Correct. And when he died, you got it all, isn't that right?"
356,00:19:52,00:19:54,What are you getting at?
357,00:19:54,00:19:56,Nothing. It's just a question.
358,00:20:08,00:20:11,(machine beeping)
359,00:20:16,00:20:19,Hi. Hi.
360,00:20:19,00:20:22,Video Spectral Analysis.
361,00:20:22,00:20:25,I want to see if I can bring out the image on the matchbook.
362,00:20:25,00:20:27,STOKES: We didn't have this equipment five years ago.
363,00:20:27,00:20:30,That's why I'm doing it now.
364,00:20:30,00:20:32,How was the door-to-door?
365,00:20:32,00:20:35,STOKES: Good exercise.
366,00:20:35,00:20:39,Everyone volunteered their prints but... no match.
367,00:20:41,00:20:43,"Warrick, just the guy I wanted to see."
368,00:20:44,00:20:45,"Ecklie, you know I'm real busy..."
369,00:20:45,00:20:47,"Ah, it won't take long. My office."
370,00:20:52,00:20:54,Uh... I'll cut to the chase.
371,00:20:54,00:20:59,Did Supervisor Grissom instruct you to analyze the hairs you found near Max Larson's body?
372,00:20:59,00:21:01,It was my job to bring the hairs to DNA.
373,00:21:01,00:21:03,Did you? Yes.
374,00:21:03,00:21:05,"Five years ago. No, yesterday."
375,00:21:06,00:21:08,"Look, if there was a problem..."
376,00:21:08,00:21:09,Have a seat.
377,00:21:13,00:21:17,"In my capacity as Assistant Director, I'm now privy to personnel files."
378,00:21:17,00:21:19,Um...
379,00:21:19,00:21:23,"You've done outstanding work over the years, Warrick. Truly."
380,00:21:23,00:21:28,I see commendations from detectives and D.A.'s...
381,00:21:28,00:21:30,I also see you have a gambling problem.
382,00:21:30,00:21:33,Ihada gambling problem.
383,00:21:35,00:21:36,What's your point?
384,00:21:38,00:21:42,"Well, it appears Supervisor Grissom counseled you appropriately."
385,00:21:42,00:21:43,(sighs)
386,00:21:43,00:21:44,That's correct.
387,00:21:44,00:21:45,So...
388,00:21:45,00:21:49,he gave you access to departmental resources to help you deal with the problem?
389,00:21:49,00:21:51,No...
390,00:21:51,00:21:53,"he helped me, uh..."
391,00:21:53,00:21:55,by being a friend.
392,00:21:55,00:21:57,Good.
393,00:22:01,00:22:02,You've been a big help.
394,00:22:03,00:22:04,Thanks.
395,00:22:07,00:22:08,Hey.
396,00:22:17,00:22:20,"This is, uh, confidential."
397,00:22:20,00:22:22,"I don't have an office, so..."
398,00:22:22,00:22:24,The inquiry into Grissom.
399,00:22:25,00:22:26,Just reviewing all documentation.
400,00:22:26,00:22:29,"Case identifiers, analysts' initials..."
401,00:22:29,00:22:33,Your responsibility is to confirm that all conclusions drawn are supported by the data.
402,00:22:33,00:22:34,They are.
403,00:22:34,00:22:35,Excuse me?
404,00:22:35,00:22:36,I worked on this case.
405,00:22:36,00:22:39,"The conclusions, they are supported."
406,00:22:39,00:22:41,I assume that's what you're finding?
407,00:22:41,00:22:43,Catherine...
408,00:22:43,00:22:49,"I appreciate your interest, but I think it's prudent to reserve my findings for the Assistant Director."
409,00:22:49,00:22:53,Right.
410,00:23:00,00:23:03,"Neil, you got a minute?"
411,00:23:03,00:23:05,I don't think I have any work pending for you.
412,00:23:05,00:23:06,I need your expertise.
413,00:23:06,00:23:07,Matchbook print.
414,00:23:07,00:23:09,Everybody's talking about it.
415,00:23:09,00:23:10,"Well, good."
416,00:23:10,00:23:13,Scientific discoveries arise through discourse.
417,00:23:13,00:23:14,Now...
418,00:23:14,00:23:18,Ninhydrin works by reacting to one end of a protein chain to form Ruhemann's purple...
419,00:23:18,00:23:20,Which makes fingerprints visible.
420,00:23:20,00:23:25,"Protein chains are made up of a series of amino acids, sometimes a hundred units long."
421,00:23:25,00:23:28,But only one end of the chain has the H-N-H... The N-terminus.
422,00:23:28,00:23:32,It's the only part of the protein molecule that interacts with Ninhydrin.
423,00:23:32,00:23:38,"But fingerprints are subjected to bacterial degradation, which causes the proteins to break down into smaller amino acids."
424,00:23:38,00:23:42,Upping the number of N-termini. And making the fingerprint more visible.
425,00:23:42,00:23:51,"But because new fingerprints are sometimes composed of fully intact proteins, you could spray Ninhydrin, and not see a result for months, yes?"
426,00:23:51,00:23:54,"Or in rare cases, years-- depending on the rate of degradation."
427,00:23:54,00:23:58,My matchbook print was inside a plastic evidence bag.
428,00:23:58,00:23:59,That could affect the rate.
429,00:23:59,00:24:00,Let's see...
430,00:24:01,00:24:02,plastic...
431,00:24:02,00:24:05,plastic traps in heat and humidity.
432,00:24:05,00:24:09,Bacteria would continue to break down over time.
433,00:24:12,00:24:16,"So theoretically, the bag was acting as a humidifying chamber."
434,00:24:16,00:24:18,I'd say you were processing a print in slow motion.
435,00:24:20,00:24:22,"Thank you, Neil."
436,00:24:22,00:24:23,I'm confused.
437,00:24:23,00:24:27,"Do we think the dead guy bought a defective gun, or was he selling a gun he'd already modified?"
438,00:24:28,00:24:29,Maybe he modified it for his own use.
439,00:24:29,00:24:33,"If that was the case, then why would he need to file down the serial numbers?"
440,00:24:33,00:24:34,Good point.
441,00:24:35,00:24:42,"Okay, so you take the polishing compound, and you rub it on the obliterated serial number."
442,00:24:42,00:24:47,And then you hit the spot with the wheel until it's mirror smooth.
443,00:24:57,00:25:00,Fry's Reagent.
444,00:25:00,00:25:04,It differentially eats away at the compressed area.
445,00:25:04,00:25:07,SANDERS: To expose the denser metal of the serial number.
446,00:25:10,00:25:12,Take a look.
447,00:25:14,00:25:17,SANDERS: Pop goes the serial number!
448,00:25:17,00:25:19,Run it through NCIC and local pawn shops.
449,00:25:19,00:25:21,See if we can get an address.
450,00:25:22,00:25:24,All right.
451,00:25:24,00:25:26,"ECKLIE: How you doing, Greg?"
452,00:25:26,00:25:28,Excuse me.
453,00:25:28,00:25:30,Sara.
454,00:25:30,00:25:32,You got a minute?
455,00:25:32,00:25:33,I guess.
456,00:25:33,00:25:35,Flitz's Compound.
457,00:25:35,00:25:37,I'm sure you're not polishing your jewelry in the lab.
458,00:25:38,00:25:39,That would be unauthorized.
459,00:25:40,00:25:42,What can I do for you?
460,00:25:42,00:25:44,"As you know, it's my job to review everyone's file."
461,00:25:44,00:25:47,I just want to make sure you finished up with your PEAP counselor.
462,00:25:47,00:25:49,"That's none of your business, Ecklie."
463,00:25:49,00:25:53,"Well, not only is it my business, but I plan to speak with your supervisor."
464,00:25:53,00:25:54,About what?
465,00:25:54,00:25:56,"You have updated him, right?"
466,00:25:56,00:25:59,"Yeah, yeah, we've had an abbreviated conversation."
467,00:25:59,00:26:00,I'm doing fine.
468,00:26:00,00:26:04,I completed my required number of sessions months ago.
469,00:26:04,00:26:08,Huh. Grissom failed to note that conversation in your file.
470,00:26:08,00:26:09,Um...
471,00:26:10,00:26:13,But I'll take care of it.
472,00:26:13,00:26:14,All right.
473,00:26:14,00:26:17,Thanks.
474,00:26:21,00:26:26,"Expose the matchbook to white, and that covers the spectrum."
475,00:26:27,00:26:30,I'll bring out the illuminants and contrast.
476,00:26:31,00:26:32,Rotate it 180.
477,00:26:37,00:26:42,"""Club PCH."" ""Los Angeles."" Is that probative?"
478,00:26:43,00:26:45,Maybe.
479,00:26:45,00:26:48,Defendant's son lived in L.A.
480,00:26:50,00:26:53,So I did a background check on Keith Garbett.
481,00:26:53,00:26:54,He has no record.
482,00:26:55,00:26:58,Moved to California two years before the murder.
483,00:26:58,00:27:01,He opened a veterinary practice in Encino.
484,00:27:01,00:27:03,He was a veterinarian?
485,00:27:03,00:27:04,Didn't I just say that?
486,00:27:04,00:27:06,We found some dog hairs at the crime scene.
487,00:27:06,00:27:08,"Out of context, it didn't really mean anything."
488,00:27:08,00:27:10,"Well, now it does."
489,00:27:14,00:27:16,Mr. Stokes.
490,00:27:16,00:27:17,Keith.
491,00:27:17,00:27:19,"Well, tell me you've got some good news."
492,00:27:19,00:27:22,Dad's lawyer says the case could get tossed.
493,00:27:22,00:27:24,"I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
494,00:27:24,00:27:25,We'd like to ask you a couple questions.
495,00:27:25,00:27:27,Sure.
496,00:27:27,00:27:28,You ever been to Club PCH?
497,00:27:28,00:27:30,I did some clubbing in my 20's.
498,00:27:30,00:27:33,What does this have to do with the investigation?
499,00:27:33,00:27:39,"Keith, what we'd really like to go ahead and do is get a set of your fingerprints, if we could. Okay?"
500,00:27:39,00:27:40,Why?
501,00:27:40,00:27:43,"You know, I'm sorry, but I don't exactly trust you guys."
502,00:27:43,00:27:44,You destroyed my family.
503,00:27:44,00:27:48,"You let my dad rot in jail for five years, and now you're coming after me?"
504,00:27:48,00:27:50,No way. Forget it.
505,00:27:52,00:27:55,I thought that went well.
506,00:27:55,00:27:58,There's more than one way to get his prints.
507,00:27:58,00:28:01,"Trash on the curb-- public property, right?"
508,00:28:01,00:28:03,Don't need a warrant.
509,00:28:11,00:28:12,This conversation is on the record.
510,00:28:13,00:28:15,Part of the official inquiry into the Max Larson case.
511,00:28:16,00:28:16,Understood.
512,00:28:17,00:28:22,"Five years ago, were you part of a team that processed a homicide at 2028 Boulder Highway?"
513,00:28:22,00:28:24,You know I was.
514,00:28:25,00:28:30,"Specifically, what tasks did Supervisor Grissom assign to you?"
515,00:28:30,00:28:32,Gil doesn't micromanage.
516,00:28:32,00:28:33,We all know what needs to be done.
517,00:28:35,00:28:42,"I photo-documented the scene, I collected blood evidence, and I brought the charred newspaper to Trace."
518,00:28:42,00:28:45,"In the analysis phase, did Grissom review your reports with you?"
519,00:28:45,00:28:48,Are you asking if he performed a supervisory review?
520,00:28:48,00:28:50,It's policy.
521,00:28:50,00:28:51,He must have.
522,00:28:51,00:28:53,I'm sure he did.
523,00:28:55,00:29:02,Are you doing all this for the sake of the lab or to indict Grissom?
524,00:29:02,00:29:10,"Catherine, there are a number of talented CSIs, like yourself, who have put in to be supervisors."
525,00:29:10,00:29:15,I just want to make sure the right people are in the right place.
526,00:29:18,00:29:24,About my request-- I really would like to supervise days.
527,00:29:24,00:29:27,Right. You're a single mother. Better hours.
528,00:29:27,00:29:30,And I bet you could use the extra cash.
529,00:29:30,00:29:32,"No, this promotion isn't about money."
530,00:29:32,00:29:34,Must be nice to be independently wealthy.
531,00:29:39,00:29:40,"We're done here, right?"
532,00:29:43,00:29:45,Yeah.
533,00:30:15,00:30:17,Vacuum metal deposition.
534,00:30:17,00:30:21,Sometimes the evidence isn't in the bag... it's on it.
535,00:30:22,00:30:25,(hissing)
536,00:30:44,00:30:49,WILLOWS: Comparing unknown matchbook print to garbage bag print.
537,00:30:55,00:30:57,"Game, set..."
538,00:30:57,00:30:58,Match.
539,00:30:59,00:31:00,We're closed.
540,00:31:02,00:31:04,"Hey, did you hear me? I said we're closed."
541,00:31:05,00:31:07,Hey... Hey!
542,00:31:20,00:31:22,It wasn't my restaurant.
543,00:31:22,00:31:25,It wasn't my problem.
544,00:31:25,00:31:26,You lied to us.
545,00:31:26,00:31:28,Said you were living in L.A.
546,00:31:28,00:31:29,at the time of the murder.
547,00:31:29,00:31:35,"WILLOWS: But while your parents were in court, suing to have that Dumpster removed, you were running the restaurant."
548,00:31:35,00:31:37,"In fact, you signed the vendor checks that week."
549,00:31:37,00:31:41,STOKES: They were in a box of records your mother sent over.
550,00:31:41,00:31:43,You saw the business was going under.
551,00:31:43,00:31:44,Their marriage was in trouble.
552,00:31:44,00:31:47,"And when the judge ruled against them, you snapped."
553,00:31:48,00:31:50,The evidence is circumstantial at best.
554,00:31:50,00:31:51,WILLOWS: You can play it that way.
555,00:31:51,00:31:52,It's fine with us.
556,00:31:52,00:31:54,You and your father can both stand trial.
557,00:31:54,00:31:56,"I mean, after all, he was the one who had motive."
558,00:31:56,00:31:57,He threatened Larson.
559,00:31:57,00:31:59,His prints were on the wrench.
560,00:31:59,00:32:02,You think the D.A. is going to try two people for the same crime?
561,00:32:02,00:32:03,"STOKES: Oh, yes, ma'am."
562,00:32:03,00:32:06,"At minimum, they're looking at conspiracy."
563,00:32:06,00:32:08,"WILLOWS: As far as we know, they could've been in it together."
564,00:32:08,00:32:11,It's easier to overpower a guy when it's two against one.
565,00:32:11,00:32:14,"Yeah, but I don't think it went down that way."
566,00:32:14,00:32:17,"After your father was convicted, you gave up on your veterinary practice."
567,00:32:17,00:32:22,Moved back to Vegas-- spent every last dime you had on his defense.
568,00:32:22,00:32:25,"Now, that tells me you had a guilty conscience."
569,00:32:25,00:32:27,It should tell you that I love my father.
570,00:32:27,00:32:30,"Your father spent the last five years in prison, man."
571,00:32:30,00:32:32,"If you love him so much, why don't you tell the truth."
572,00:32:32,00:32:33,Set him free.
573,00:32:42,00:32:44,My father had nothing to do with it.
574,00:32:45,00:32:46,Keith...
575,00:32:46,00:32:50,I never thought that they would convict an innocent man.
576,00:32:50,00:32:51,So... I kept quiet.
577,00:32:54,00:32:56,To protect yourself.
578,00:33:03,00:33:06,ECKLIE: We'll convene in my office at the end of your shift.
579,00:33:06,00:33:09,Regarding what? This case is over.
580,00:33:09,00:33:10,Don't be late.
581,00:33:19,00:33:21,Hey. Hey.
582,00:33:21,00:33:22,What's going on? Dispatch said to meet you here.
583,00:33:22,00:33:28,"Well, three days ago we found a John Doe who was shot to death in an abandoned parking lot off Strip."
584,00:33:28,00:33:30,"Uh, there was a Mac-10 near the body."
585,00:33:30,00:33:35,"Gun is registered to a Paul Turlock, who happens to be the owner of the house."
586,00:33:35,00:33:39,"Oh, so you want to see if Paul Turlock and John Doe are one and the same."
587,00:33:39,00:33:42,Yeah. Okay.
588,00:33:42,00:33:45,Odds are looking pretty good so far.
589,00:33:51,00:33:53,Police! Anybody here?
590,00:34:31,00:34:33,Sara.
591,00:34:36,00:34:38,Any of these look like your guy?
592,00:34:38,00:34:41,"Guy on the end with the ""Rita"" tattoo."
593,00:34:41,00:34:44,Think Rita's his mom or his girlfriend?
594,00:34:44,00:34:47,"If it's not crossed out, it's definitely his mom."
595,00:34:47,00:34:49,Mac in the box.
596,00:34:49,00:34:52,Five of them. Serials obliterated.
597,00:34:55,00:34:57,Files and grinding stone.
598,00:34:57,00:35:01,It's all the tools needed to convert a semi into an auto and then cover your tracks.
599,00:35:01,00:35:03,Each modified weapon's a separate count.
600,00:35:04,00:35:06,Each filed-off serial number's a separate count.
601,00:35:06,00:35:08,This guy was looking at ten felonies.
602,00:35:08,00:35:11,"Actually, he already got the death penalty."
603,00:35:11,00:35:13,(beep)
604,00:35:13,00:35:16,"(on answering machine): Hey, Paulie, we, uh, liked what we saw."
605,00:35:16,00:35:17,Deal's a go.
606,00:35:17,00:35:19,Five large for five units.
607,00:35:19,00:35:21,I'll call youse back to arrange a time.
608,00:35:21,00:35:22,(beep)
609,00:35:22,00:35:24,Paulie. 9:00 p.m. Monday.
610,00:35:24,00:35:26,That's tonight.
611,00:35:26,00:35:28,"""We liked what we saw""?"
612,00:35:28,00:35:33,That tells me that Paulie's already met with the buyers-- probably to show them the prototype of the Mac-10.
613,00:35:33,00:35:35,Maybe they met at the parking lot where we found the body.
614,00:35:36,00:35:40,"You know, most likely they'd hook up at the same location to complete the sale."
615,00:35:41,00:35:42,Buyers don't know he's dead.
616,00:35:42,00:35:44,Lucky for us.
617,00:35:55,00:35:58,"Hell of a job on the Larson case, Nick."
618,00:35:58,00:36:01,"If it weren't for you, the son would've walked."
619,00:36:01,00:36:03,It was a team effort.
620,00:36:03,00:36:05,Team effort?
621,00:36:05,00:36:08,"Just like the Westanson case, right?"
622,00:36:09,00:36:13,"Last year, that woman who burned to ashes in a barrel of diesel fuel."
623,00:36:13,00:36:17,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm familiar with the case, Conrad."
624,00:36:17,00:36:18,I reviewed Grissom's report.
625,00:36:18,00:36:20,It seems to me that you were a...
626,00:36:20,00:36:23,one-man CSI machine.
627,00:36:23,00:36:24,(chuckles)
628,00:36:24,00:36:32,"Grissom rejected Fay Minden's testimony, but not you. No, Grissom allowed me to pursue a new lead, under his supervision."
629,00:36:33,00:36:37,Did he offer you any other CSIs as support staff?
630,00:36:38,00:36:40,D-Don't worry about it.
631,00:36:40,00:36:42,I respect your independence.
632,00:36:43,00:36:47,"Anyway, good work."
633,00:36:48,00:36:50,(door closes)
634,00:37:17,00:37:19,(siren wailing)
635,00:37:25,00:37:26,Keep your hands up.
636,00:37:26,00:37:28,No sudden moves.
637,00:37:29,00:37:31,ATF. I'm an agent.
638,00:37:31,00:37:34,"Just keep your hands where I can see 'em, and you won't get hurt."
639,00:37:36,00:37:40,"Special Agent John Calder, ATF."
640,00:37:40,00:37:42,He's an undercover agent.
641,00:37:42,00:37:43,I don't believe this.
642,00:37:43,00:37:46,You're involved in a buy bust for some firearms?
643,00:37:46,00:37:47,CALDER: You boys burned us bad.
644,00:37:47,00:37:48,We were gonna make an arrest tonight.
645,00:37:48,00:37:50,SIDLE: Suspect's name is Paul Turlock?
646,00:37:50,00:37:54,Yeah. Mr. Turlock A.D.'d a Mac into his femoral artery.
647,00:37:54,00:37:56,You guys are four days too late.
648,00:37:56,00:37:58,"Wrap it up, boys, let's go home."
649,00:37:58,00:38:03,"If I understand you correctly, the latent fingerprint on the matchbook..."
650,00:38:03,00:38:06,continued to processitself after you were finished.
651,00:38:06,00:38:09,"Theoretically, yes."
652,00:38:09,00:38:16,"As I know you are aware, I've asked Sofia to review your handling of the Max Larson homicide."
653,00:38:16,00:38:21,Did Supervisor Grissom violate any procedures in mishandling the evidence?
654,00:38:25,00:38:27,I don't believe he mishandled anything.
655,00:38:27,00:38:34,"He followed laboratory protocol, and when he saw that the evidence didn't correspond to his records, he notified the D.A."
656,00:38:34,00:38:37,and recused himself from case review.
657,00:38:38,00:38:48,"Are you saying that, uh, his handling of the discovery of new evidence while on the stand is within our protocols?"
658,00:38:50,00:38:54,"As it applies to this case, yes."
659,00:39:03,00:39:09,"In the, uh... in the process of investigating this case, your ability to supervise has come into question."
660,00:39:11,00:39:15,Isn't that a little beyond the scope of this inquiry?
661,00:39:15,00:39:20,"Again, we have no evidence that Grissom violated any protocols or proc..."
662,00:39:20,00:39:21,Thank you for your input.
663,00:39:21,00:39:24,"Okay, Conrad, what do you got? Let's hear it."
664,00:39:24,00:39:28,"Well, taken individually, there's nothing specific that warrants disciplinary action."
665,00:39:28,00:39:37,"However, my investigation has led me to question the effectiveness of your team and your ability to lead it."
666,00:39:39,00:39:41,I'm breaking you guys up.
667,00:39:43,00:39:45,Excuse me?
668,00:39:45,00:39:47,I've already spoken with the director.
669,00:39:47,00:39:49,Staff assignments are under my purview.
670,00:39:49,00:39:54,"Effective immediately, Catherine Willows will be promoted to swing shift supervisor..."
671,00:39:54,00:39:56,"Wait a minute, Catherine applied for days."
672,00:39:56,00:39:57,I do what's best for the lab.
673,00:39:58,00:40:08,I've decided to move the swing shift supervisor to days... I've been the acting supervisor of days for the past month-- I believe I've proven myself capable.
674,00:40:08,00:40:11,Warrick Brown and Nick Stokes will report to Catherine.
675,00:40:11,00:40:17,"Greg Sanders, pending his proficiency, Sara Sidle and Sofia will report to you."
676,00:40:17,00:40:18,You're demoting me.
677,00:40:18,00:40:21,I think you and Grissom suit each other.
678,00:40:24,00:40:26,Why are you doing this?
679,00:40:26,00:40:29,There's been a chronic lack of supervision on the graveyard shift.
680,00:40:29,00:40:31,"Your people have been covering for you, Gil."
681,00:40:31,00:40:33,For your shortcomings.
682,00:40:33,00:40:38,"Before your mismanagement jeopardizes this lab, I'm rectifying the situation."
683,00:40:38,00:40:40,(chuckles)
684,00:40:43,00:40:45,My decision is final.
685,00:40:52,00:40:55,He kind of talked to all of us.
686,00:40:55,00:40:58,It was more like he ambushed all of us.
687,00:40:58,00:40:59,"Real sorry, Grissom."
688,00:40:59,00:41:02,There's no reason to be.
689,00:41:02,00:41:06,"Look, Ecklie doesn't have a scientific bone in his body."
690,00:41:06,00:41:10,He starts with the answers he wants and then devises the questions to get them.
691,00:41:10,00:41:12,This sucks.
692,00:41:12,00:41:19,"This guy has been kissing ass all his life, he's trying to tell me-- he's trying to tellus what makes a good supervisor."
693,00:41:19,00:41:21,What makes a good team?
694,00:41:21,00:41:28,"Well, if a team gets used to doing things a certain way just because that's the way they've always done them, then they start to lose their effectiveness."
695,00:41:29,00:41:30,"Oh, come on."
696,00:41:30,00:41:32,You don't really believe that.
697,00:41:32,00:41:36,"No. I believe that the longer a team works together, the stronger they become."
698,00:41:36,00:41:40,"But I'm not in charge of the lab, nor would I want to be."
699,00:41:41,00:41:45,I got this-- that's the kind of cash I'm bringing down right now.
700,00:41:45,00:41:47,(Brown chuckles)
701,00:41:49,00:41:54,"I always knew there'd come a time when we weren't, uh, working together anymore."
702,00:41:54,00:41:57,I just didn't think it'd be under these circumstances.
703,00:41:58,00:42:00,(phone rings)
704,00:42:05,00:42:06,Brown.
705,00:42:07,00:42:10,Okay. All right.
706,00:42:10,00:42:12,"No, I'll tell Nick."
707,00:42:12,00:42:14,We'll see you there.
708,00:42:14,00:42:16,"Uh, congrats, by the way."
709,00:42:17,00:42:19,All right.
710,00:42:19,00:42:22,My new supervisor.
711,00:42:22,00:42:24,Catherine?
712,00:42:24,00:42:26,Yeah.
713,00:42:26,00:42:30,"Good. Well, I got to get some rest."
714,00:42:30,00:42:32,Swing shift starts at 4:00 in the afternoon.
715,00:42:33,00:42:34,That's a big change.
716,00:42:34,00:42:45,"Heracleitus once said, ""It is in changing that we find purpose."" Well, thanks to you, this job, I already know my purpose."
