0	00:00:30	00:00:33	- You're late. - Thursday night. Traffic on the Strip.
1	00:00:33	00:00:35	Like every night. We're on a deadline. Go.
2	00:00:45	00:00:47	Man versus gravity.
3	00:00:48	00:00:50	Man lost.
4	00:00:50	00:00:53	I think that was his point.
5	00:00:53	00:00:54	- Hello, Bob. - Hey, Brian.
6	00:00:55	00:00:56	Grissom, what are you doing here?
7	00:00:56	00:01:00	- What do you think? - I didn't alert Homicide.
8	00:01:00	00:01:02	Dispatch called. The body's on county property.
9	00:01:03	00:01:05	Well, we're not looking at a crime here.
10	00:01:05	00:01:07	Bob explained it to me on the phone.
11	00:01:08	00:01:12	His guy was alone up there He jumped. This is suicide.
12	00:01:12	00:01:15	- Then why are you here, Sheriff? - Look er...
13	00:01:15	00:01:17	Roger Valenti was an unhappy guy.
14	00:01:17	00:01:19	Money problems, family problems...
15	00:01:20	00:01:21	He took the easy way out.
16	00:01:21	00:01:25	It's a tragedy, but it is not a crime.
17	00:01:26	00:01:28	Suicide, huh?
18	00:01:28	00:01:34	I don't know Brian On the day you decide to end your life, why would you go to work?
19	00:02:11	00:02:16	1,400 new beds means 1,400 criminals off the street. That old jail's maxed.
20	00:02:17	00:02:20	The prison population's increased by 10% in one year.
21	00:02:20	00:02:22	If this place isn't built soon, you do the math.
22	00:02:23	00:02:27	You look like the Sheriff, but you talk like the Mayor.
23	00:02:27	00:02:30	Mr Harris, do you get an extra bonus for early completion?
24	00:02:30	00:02:32	20 grand a day. I'm 10 days ahead.
25	00:02:32	00:02:36	Wow. $200,000. You must work your guys pretty hard, huh?
26	00:02:46	00:02:50	- Where was Valenti's work station? - He had the whole floor to himself.
27	00:02:50	00:02:52	Valenti was usually my first guy up.
28	00:02:52	00:02:55	He would drill the holes for the safety cables.
29	00:02:56	00:03:00	No-one walks a new slab until the cables are looped around the perimeter.
30	00:03:08	00:03:11	Terminal velocity is 9.8 metres per second squared.
31	00:03:11	00:03:14	He would have hit the ground in under five seconds.
32	00:03:55	00:03:59	- Did this belong to Mr Valenti? - Well, like I said, he was the only one up here.
33	00:04:02	00:04:05	This drill has shorted out.
34	00:04:05	00:04:09	Do you think he jumped before or after he got the shock of his life?
35	00:04:09	00:04:11	GFCI would have prevented shock.
36	00:04:11	00:04:12	What is GFCI?
37	00:04:12	00:04:14	The Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter.
38	00:04:14	00:04:17	Big words meaning he won't get electrocuted.
39	00:04:18	00:04:25	You see, if there's an electrical imbalance, then the GFCI trips the circuit and the tool's supposed to shut itself off.
40	00:04:29	00:04:34	But if the third prong of the plug is compromised, the interrupter won't work.
41	00:04:34	00:04:35	Will it, Bob?
42	00:04:35	00:04:37	The third prong grounds the drill.
43	00:04:37	00:04:39	Without it, the interrupter's useless.
44	00:04:39	00:04:43	These prongs don't usually snap off by themselves.
45	00:05:00	00:05:04	Are all your workers this careless with their tools?
46	00:05:07	00:05:10	Do you mind telling me what you're doing?
47	00:05:10	00:05:14	These cutters may have been used to tamper with the grounding prong.
48	00:05:14	00:05:16	What happened to good old dusting for prints?
49	00:05:17	00:05:19	When your crime scene is 12 storeys up...
50	00:05:20	00:05:22	...I don't wanna take any chances.
51	00:05:25	00:05:27	I'm gonna lock in these prints.
52	00:05:39	00:05:41	Hey, O'Riley. We got the 419.
53	00:05:42	00:05:45	Dylan Buckley. 14 years old.
54	00:05:50	00:05:57	The paramedics pronounced The coroner's on his way Was he home alone?
55	00:05:59	00:06:01	Not alone. Not his home.
56	00:06:04	00:06:07	Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes. Crime Lab.
57	00:06:08	00:06:09	Dr Leigh Sapien.
58	00:06:09	00:06:14	This is her residence On good Then you can fill us in.
59	00:06:14	00:06:16	- We were in the middle of a session. - You're a therapist?
60	00:06:17	00:06:20	- Psychiatrist. - And why were you seeing Dylan?
61	00:06:21	00:06:22	Doctor-patient privilege.
62	00:06:22	00:06:24	Privilege doesn't extend post mortem.
63	00:06:24	00:06:26	We can get a warrant for your records.
64	00:06:26	00:06:30	No need. Dylan suffered from reactive-attachment disorder.
65	00:06:30	00:06:33	Issues with his mother. I'd been treating him for 16 months.
66	00:06:33	00:06:35	It's ten o'clock at night.
67	00:06:35	00:06:36	Is this your home?
68	00:06:37	00:06:38	I see my patients whenever they need me.
69	00:06:39	00:06:41	On weekends, at night, at the office or here.
70	00:06:41	00:06:44	Why don't you... just tell us what happened?
71	00:06:44	00:06:47	Dylan had an argument with his mother. He needed to unload.
72	00:06:47	00:07:01	He was complaining about his curfew blaming his mother for problems at school Suddenly he began to convulse I tried to stabilise his head, but it was a grand mal seizure.
73	00:07:03	00:07:05	Dylan was an epileptic.
74	00:07:05	00:07:07	He hit his head.
75	00:07:07	00:07:09	And when the convulsions stopped, he was dead.
76	00:07:09	00:07:11	Did you try to revive him?
77	00:07:11	00:07:16	Of course Standard CPR Cleared his airway, worked his chest.
78	00:07:19	00:07:22	I... take it this wasn't his first convulsion?
79	00:07:22	00:07:25	He was diagnosed with epilepsy at age three.
80	00:07:26	00:07:28	W-What are you doing?
81	00:07:28	00:07:31	Catherine, we need to get a tape lift here, please.
82	00:07:37	00:07:39	Look, I dialled 911.
83	00:07:40	00:07:41	I'm not hiding anything.
84	00:07:42	00:07:43	Well...
85	00:07:44	00:07:45	I can see that.
86	00:07:55	00:07:58	Quick. Name three human bones that can withstand a 12-storey drop.
87	00:07:58	00:08:02	The bones of the inner ear - malleus, incus, stapes.
88	00:08:02	00:08:06	High cellular density, completely protected by the skull. Why?
89	00:08:06	00:08:09	They appear to be the only bones not fractured or broken.
90	00:08:09	00:08:11	I wanna see the entry and exit wounds.
91	00:08:12	00:08:15	He wasn't shot. This guy fell off the new jailhouse. Are we on the same case?
92	00:08:15	00:08:19	- He fell after he was electrocuted. - News to me.
93	00:08:19	00:08:22	I didn't find any physical evidence of electrocution.
94	00:08:22	00:08:24	Faulty drill.
95	00:08:24	00:08:26	There should be burn marks on one of his palms.
96	00:08:29	00:08:37	Negative on the burn marks In most electrocution cases, capillaries rupture, haemoglobin leaks into the perivascular tissue.
97	00:08:38	00:08:41	Right. Creating a fern-like pattern on the chest.
98	00:08:47	00:08:49	His body contradicts your crime scene.
99	00:08:49	00:08:52	I don't care what his body says. This guy was electrocuted.
100	00:08:52	00:08:54	It was not an accident.
101	00:09:07	00:09:08	What?
102	00:09:09	00:09:10	I don't know what I'm looking for.
103	00:09:10	00:09:13	Signs of charring or melting. You've done this before.
104	00:09:14	00:09:17	Yean but we always go back to the body.
105	00:09:17	00:09:19	The body tells the story.
106	00:09:19	00:09:23	And, in this case, the body says there was no crime and you're not listening.
107	00:09:24	00:09:25	Why?
108	00:09:25	00:09:27	Now and then we have to break the rules.
109	00:09:27	00:09:30	Start with the conclusion and work our way backwards.
110	00:09:30	00:09:32	Like when we don't agree with the coroner's report?
111	00:09:33	00:09:39	Like, for instance, in the 1800s... when surgery was Russian roulette and patients were dying on the tables.
112	00:09:40	00:09:45	- Germs? - Until Louis Pasteur theorised that something we could not see was attacking the patients.
113	00:09:45	00:09:51	- Relevance? - Bodies tell us stories because we interpret them how our predecessors taught us to.
114	00:09:51	00:09:54	Not seeing something doesn't mean that it's not there.
115	00:10:07	00:10:08	Wires are crossed.
116	00:10:10	00:10:12	Polarity's been reversed.
117	00:10:14	00:10:18	This confirms that someone tampered with Valenti's drill.
118	00:10:21	00:10:25	The rubber soles of his boots should have protected him from electrical shock.
119	00:10:25	00:10:30	That's why you're safe in a car during a lightning storm - you're insulated by the rubber tyres.
120	00:10:34	00:10:38	Rubber's an insulator, but metal's a conductor.
121	00:10:38	00:10:42	What form of metal hides in plain view at a construction site?
122	00:10:47	00:11:02	A nail Hey How's that palm print Grissom got off those cutters?
123	00:11:02	00:11:04	Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now.
124	00:11:04	00:11:09	Good thing is, the jailhouse is a union gig, and all the union guys are already in the database.
125	00:11:09	00:11:16	What I did for the print was I lined up the ridge detail from the partial that I found on each handle.
126	00:11:16	00:11:17	Nice.
127	00:11:19	00:11:20	(Sighs) So...
128	00:11:20	00:11:22	you think that guy fried before he fell?
129	00:11:23	00:11:25	I don't know. We found a nail in his boot.
130	00:11:25	00:11:27	It could have pierced the protective rubber.
131	00:11:28	00:11:31	It might have allowed electricity to course through his body.
132	00:11:31	00:11:33	Bobby Dawson's taking odds.
133	00:11:34	00:11:36	2 to 1, Grissom's wrong.
134	00:11:36	00:11:39	5 to 1, he gets suspended for shutting down that jailhouse.
135	00:11:40	00:11:43	- 10 to 1... - Fired.
136	00:11:48	00:11:55	Sounds like you got a match Hey Gris How long have you been there?
137	00:11:55	00:11:57	Yeah. Yeah, we do.
138	00:11:58	00:12:03	The um... It's a former union guy, turned night-shift project manager.
139	00:12:03	00:12:04	Robert Harris.
140	00:12:04	00:12:06	Does that name mean anything?
141	00:12:06	00:12:07	Yeah.
142	00:12:07	00:12:09	Especially if you bet against me.
143	00:12:17	00:12:21	My prints are on the cutters because they're on everything at the site. I'm the project manager.
144	00:12:21	00:12:23	There's no mystery here.
145	00:12:23	00:12:26	You are, but you don't actually use all the tools, right?
146	00:12:26	00:12:28	I'm vigilant about safety.
147	00:12:28	00:12:31	I'm always inspecting the equipment, tools...
148	00:12:31	00:12:34	Look, this is what's going to happen here.
149	00:12:34	00:12:38	The construction site is going to reopen and the investigation goes away.
150	00:12:38	00:12:41	Sure. After the lab processes all the evidence.
151	00:12:42	00:12:44	Excuse me.
152	00:12:47	00:12:49	For the record, I don't like being put in the middle.
153	00:12:50	00:12:51	Who does?
154	00:12:51	00:12:55	I did a little homework on the guy who took a nose dive after he was electrocuted.
155	00:12:55	00:12:57	Three days ago he was voted union rep.
156	00:12:57	00:13:00	Demanded more overtime pay. Pressed for a walkout.
157	00:13:00	00:13:02	- Motive? - Right.
158	00:13:04	00:13:08	Oh, in case you're interested, Bob Harris was the Sheriff's best man.
159	00:13:14	00:13:18	- What was that about? - Oh... We're in a bowling league together.
160	00:13:18	00:13:20	- Can we wrap this up? - Sure.
161	00:13:20	00:13:23	Someone tampered with Roger Valenti's drill.
162	00:13:24	00:13:25	And I have only one suspect.
163	00:13:25	00:13:27	I read the coroner's prelim.
164	00:13:27	00:13:30	There is nothing in it about electrocution.
165	00:13:30	00:13:32	That's why it's a prelim.
166	00:13:33	00:13:36	Mr Harris, were you against Valenti's union activities?
167	00:13:36	00:13:39	Of course not. I'm a union man myself.
168	00:13:39	00:13:41	You're fishing, Gil. We're done here.
169	00:13:41	00:13:43	Moving on.
170	00:14:36	00:14:39	Mrs Buckley, do you have someone to drive you home?
171	00:14:40	00:14:42	- Mrs Buckley? - Yes?
172	00:14:42	00:14:44	Do you have someone to drive you home?
173	00:14:44	00:14:47	Oh, er... Thank you, I'll be all right.
174	00:14:52	00:14:54	- Mrs Buckley? - Yeah.
175	00:14:54	00:14:57	I'm Nick Stokes, Crime Lab. I've been assigned your son's case.
176	00:14:58	00:15:01	- Crime Lab? - It's... protocol.
177	00:15:03	00:15:05	We were... just having pizza together.
178	00:15:05	00:15:06	He seemed fine and...
179	00:15:06	00:15:09	I dropped him off at Dr Sapien's and...
180	00:15:13	00:15:17	My husband passed away three years ago and now my...
181	00:15:29	00:15:31	...my baby's gone.
182	00:15:33	00:15:34	I understand.
183	00:15:36	00:15:39	If you'll excuse me, I need to go and make arrangements.
184	00:15:39	00:15:40	Sure.
185	00:15:42	00:15:44	I'm sorry for your loss.
186	00:15:46	00:15:48	Thank you.
187	00:16:01	00:16:03	My youngest just turned 14.
188	00:16:03	00:16:05	Tough age.
189	00:16:08	00:16:09	Cause of death?
190	00:16:10	00:16:14	Cranial cerebral injuries. Comminuted fractures of the occipital bone.
191	00:16:20	00:16:22	Injuries consistent with a grand mal seizure?
192	00:16:23	00:16:25	First blush, yes.
193	00:16:25	00:16:29	Waiting on toxicology. In the meantime, check out his torso.
194	00:16:29	00:16:34	He's covered in bruises Possibly from being thrashed during the seizure?
195	00:16:34	00:16:35	Possibly.
196	00:16:37	00:16:39	I found tan fibres on his boxers.
197	00:16:39	00:16:42	You, too, huh? His body's covered in them.
198	00:16:42	00:16:46	Fibres on his body, his underwear, but not on his shirt and pants. Why?
199	00:16:46	00:16:50	Maybe it's as simple as he wasn't wearing his shirt and pants.
200	00:16:50	00:16:53	Then, at some point, he was with his shrink... in his underwear.
201	00:16:53	00:16:56	Exactly what kind of therapy was this?
202	00:17:24	00:17:26	- Gil Grissom? - Yes.
203	00:17:26	00:17:30	I have information... about Roger Valenti.
204	00:17:30	00:17:31	Call Jim Brass at Homicide.
205	00:17:34	00:17:38	I was the union rep before Roger. The walkout was my idea.
206	00:17:38	00:17:40	Bob Harris...
207	00:17:40	00:17:42	threatened me and my family.
208	00:17:43	00:17:47	I wouldn't betray the union, so I gave up my position at the local.
209	00:17:47	00:17:49	Roger... picked up where I left off.
210	00:17:49	00:17:50	Why are you telling me this?
211	00:17:51	00:17:52	Because it could have been me.
212	00:17:54	00:17:56	Cheese...
213	00:17:56	00:17:58	milk...
214	00:17:59	00:18:00	...sweaters.
215	00:18:00	00:18:03	What do these things have in common?
216	00:18:03	00:18:05	Goat cheese. Goat milk.
217	00:18:05	00:18:08	- Goat... sweaters? - Angora.
218	00:18:08	00:18:11	Ding, ding, ding! Fibres from the lady shrink, fibres from the boy.
219	00:18:11	00:18:15	Both are angora Angora is processed goat hair?
220	00:18:15	00:18:16	Mm-hm.
221	00:18:16	00:18:20	Sheared, washed, spun and dyed. Angora is 100% goat.
222	00:18:21	00:18:22	You didn't know that, Nick?
223	00:18:24	00:18:26	- Must be a chick thing. - (Laughs)
224	00:18:30	00:18:32	I need to see the body again.
225	00:18:32	00:18:35	- No can do. Released six hours ago. - Final report?
226	00:18:35	00:18:39	Another 24, but there's nothing to support Valenti was electrocuted.
227	00:18:39	00:18:43	- Doc, please. - You want to look at my notes.
228	00:18:46	00:18:47	So, what have you got?
229	00:18:48	00:18:50	I mean, anything unusual, even the mundane.
230	00:18:50	00:18:54	His troponin enzymes are elevated.
231	00:18:54	00:18:59	They become elevated after ventricular fibrillation, which could be caused by electrocution.
232	00:18:59	00:19:02	Sure, but troponin is found in all victims of cardiac arrest.
233	00:19:02	00:19:04	Most of whom have not been zapped.
234	00:19:04	00:19:05	Work with me, will you?
235	00:19:05	00:19:09	Er... Vic also had an elevated concentration of iron in his blood.
236	00:19:09	00:19:11	Six, seven times normal.
237	00:19:11	00:19:13	- Life-threatening? - No.
238	00:19:13	00:19:14	What else?
239	00:19:14	00:19:18	Well, it fits the bill of mundane. His skin looked jaundiced.
240	00:19:18	00:19:20	Postmortem deoxygenation?
241	00:19:20	00:19:23	Dead or alive, your vic's epidermis is yellow.
242	00:19:26	00:19:28	- Tell me about his testicles. - What?
243	00:19:31	00:19:34	OK, I'm working with you. Er...
244	00:19:34	00:19:35	I... I don't remember.
245	00:19:36	00:19:41	I mean... genetics can be fascinating and there are things I take note of.
246	00:19:42	00:19:43	But I didn't focus on his genitals.
247	00:19:45	00:19:47	Thanks, doc.
248	00:19:48	00:19:50	You're welcome.
249	00:19:50	00:19:58	Let's cool off with a blast from the past Here's Chubby Checker and Limbo Rock What are you guys doing?
250	00:19:58	00:20:00	Waiting for an assignment.
251	00:20:01	00:20:03	- You got a new case for us? - A new case?
252	00:20:03	00:20:06	We heard the Sheriff put the brakes on the investigation.
253	00:20:06	00:20:07	I didn't say that, did I?
254	00:20:09	00:20:13	Well, I think I er... smell something burning in the DNA Lab.
255	00:20:13	00:20:16	- Love to stay and chat, but... - Greg?
256	00:20:18	00:20:20	I hope that's not the crossword puzzle.
257	00:20:20	00:20:24	Hey let's do the limbo rock! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha!
258	00:20:24	00:20:26	Don't move that limbo bar!
259	00:20:26	00:20:32	You'll be a limbo star How low can you go?
260	00:20:32	00:20:35	What about the nail we pulled out of Valenti's boot?
261	00:20:35	00:20:37	- Dusted? - No, cos...
262	00:20:37	00:20:39	Process the nail, please. If you get a print...
263	00:20:39	00:20:42	I'll compare it to Bob Harris's ten card.
264	00:20:42	00:20:44	Anything else?
265	00:20:44	00:20:45	Yes. Metal cutters.
266	00:20:45	00:20:49	I need you to prove or disprove whether they were used to sever the grounding prong.
267	00:20:49	00:20:50	OK.
268	00:20:53	00:20:54	And you're with me.
269	00:21:28	00:21:29	Mr Gesek!
270	00:21:32	00:21:33	You're conducting.
271	00:21:36	00:21:39	- I didn't hear you come in. - Vivaldi. Four Seasons.
272	00:21:39	00:21:41	Vivaldi, Valenti.
273	00:21:42	00:21:44	Both Italians. It's like... being in Venice.
274	00:21:47	00:21:50	Why are you here? Do I need a lawyer?
275	00:21:50	00:21:51	Have you prepped him yet?
276	00:21:52	00:21:54	I was about to commence draining when I got distracted.
277	00:21:55	00:21:57	Yeah, I know - Venice. I need to see his testicles.
278	00:21:57	00:21:59	I knew there was something weird about you.
279	00:21:59	00:22:01	Excuse me!
280	00:22:01	00:22:04	You can't just come in here and look at my guy's goods.
281	00:22:04	00:22:07	If I let you see him, I have to let everybody see him.
282	00:22:08	00:22:13	- But... perhaps we can work something out. - What? Do you want us to pay to see him?
283	00:22:13	00:22:15	That's a good idea, but no.
284	00:22:15	00:22:19	Crime Scene Cleanup. I'll want some referrals.
285	00:22:20	00:22:22	I'll put you on a list.
286	00:22:26	00:22:27	Testicular atrophy.
287	00:22:27	00:22:29	They're the size of peas.
288	00:22:29	00:22:30	Poor guy.
289	00:22:31	00:22:34	Yeah, that's rough. And the significance of this evidence?
290	00:22:34	00:22:36	Haemochromatosis.
291	00:22:36	00:22:39	Valenti had elevated levels of iron in his blood.
292	00:22:40	00:22:42	Yellow pallor. Shrunken testicles.
293	00:22:42	00:22:45	He's been ingesting trace amounts of iron over a long period of time.
294	00:22:45	00:22:47	Why'd he eat iron?
295	00:22:47	00:22:50	Trace amounts are odourless, tasteless. He probably didn't know.
296	00:22:51	00:22:52	- You're saying he was poisoned? - No.
297	00:22:53	00:22:55	Iron molecules take a long time to build up.
298	00:22:55	00:22:59	Could have been his diet, repeated blood transfusions, excessive smoking.
299	00:22:59	00:23:01	Possibly hereditary abnormalities.
300	00:23:01	00:23:03	So, where does this get us?
301	00:23:03	00:23:05	One step closer. Mr Gesek...
302	00:23:05	00:23:08	Stick a syringe in his carotid, all the way to his clavicle.
303	00:23:08	00:23:10	You want his blood?
304	00:23:10	00:23:12	One pint. To go.
305	00:23:18	00:23:19	- Warrick. - Hey.
306	00:23:19	00:23:22	- I got a thumbprint off that nail. - Cool.
307	00:23:22	00:23:24	Only a partial. Print Lab's running a comparison.
308	00:23:24	00:23:27	Whatever happened with those metal cutters?
309	00:23:27	00:23:30	Serrations didn't match up. They weren't used on the grounding prong.
310	00:23:30	00:23:33	- What's in the envelope? - Roger Valenti's blood.
311	00:23:34	00:23:36	Grissom wants it packaged in plastic.
312	00:23:36	00:23:37	I don't know. Don't ask.
313	00:23:38	00:23:40	You want lunch?
314	00:23:40	00:23:42	Later.
315	00:23:45	00:23:46	- Hey, Catherine? - Yeah.
316	00:23:46	00:23:47	You ever been in therapy?
317	00:23:47	00:23:49	Who hasn't?
318	00:23:49	00:23:51	Didn't save my marriage.
319	00:23:51	00:23:54	You were OK sharing your problems with a complete stranger?
320	00:23:54	00:23:56	You rather I tell them to you?
321	00:23:57	00:23:58	Somebody order a warrant?
322	00:23:58	00:24:01	- Yeah. - Mustard and relish. Hold the onions.
323	00:24:01	00:24:02	I hope it's a general.
324	00:24:02	00:24:05	Epilepsy. Eyewitness physician dials 911.
325	00:24:06	00:24:08	Coroner's quiet. You're lucky to get a limited.
326	00:24:08	00:24:12	What do you mean? We've got fibres on a 14-year-old and the shrink's clothing.
327	00:24:12	00:24:14	Which would have got you nothing.
328	00:24:14	00:24:18	But I did a check on the doctor. She once had her licence suspended.
329	00:24:18	00:24:23	Sex with a patient. Teen's parents filed a complaint with the APA.
330	00:24:23	00:24:27	Sex with a minor? Suspension's a joke. She should have lost her licence, minimum.
331	00:24:27	00:24:29	Yeah, well, this time maybe she will.
332	00:24:52	00:24:54	OK, Gris.
333	00:24:56	00:24:58	Valenti's blood.
334	00:24:58	00:24:59	Packaged. Ready to go.
335	00:24:59	00:25:01	Thank you.
336	00:25:04	00:25:06	You wanna fill me in here? I mean...
337	00:25:06	00:25:09	This wasn't covered in any science class I took.
338	00:25:09	00:25:11	Well, iron is a conductive mineral.
339	00:25:13	00:25:18	I wanna know if there was enough iron in Valenti's blood... to conduct electricity.
340	00:25:19	00:25:21	- That's far out - Yeah, well...
341	00:25:21	00:25:23	We'll see.
342	00:25:23	00:25:25	Plug in the blood.
343	00:25:43	00:25:46	Angora fibres? What does that have to do with anything?
344	00:25:50	00:25:54	Excuse me, I don't appreciate being treated like a suspect.
345	00:25:54	00:25:56	Then maybe you should wait outside.
346	00:25:56	00:25:59	Do you consider me a suspect? Because that's how I'm feeling.
347	00:26:03	00:26:06	Fine Don't answer me. It's your choice.
348	00:26:07	00:26:09	Funny thing about choices.
349	00:26:09	00:26:11	Once you make 'em, you have to live with 'em.
350	00:26:14	00:26:16	Dylan Buckley was just a boy.
351	00:26:18	00:26:20	He trusted you.
352	00:26:20	00:26:22	And you abused that trust.
353	00:26:24	00:26:26	Linen closet. Top shelf.
354	00:26:27	00:26:28	Was that blanket here?
355	00:26:29	00:26:31	On the floor, with you and Dylan under it?
356	00:26:41	00:26:43	It's gonna be OK.
357	00:26:44	00:26:46	That's it. That's it.
358	00:26:46	00:26:48	That's it. That's it.
359	00:26:50	00:26:55	He was a 14-year-old kid What's the matter with you?
360	00:26:55	00:26:59	He resisted. You persisted. Then what?
361	00:26:59	00:27:03	I don't know the basis of your allegations, but I have never crossed the line.
362	00:27:03	00:27:05	That's not what your rap sheet says.
363	00:27:05	00:27:06	Rap sheet?
364	00:27:06	00:27:08	Sex with an underage patient.
365	00:27:08	00:27:12	I was a resident. He was 17. We were in...
366	00:27:12	00:27:16	Look, no criminal charges were filed. It should have been expunged from my record.
367	00:27:16	00:27:18	It doesn't make you any less guilty.
368	00:27:18	00:27:23	Lady, I'm not a saint, but I am not a killer or a child molester.
369	00:27:24	00:27:26	Dylan Buckley was an epileptic.
370	00:27:27	00:27:29	He had a seizure. He hit his head.
371	00:27:29	00:27:31	That's the truth.
372	00:27:31	00:27:33	You don't like it? You can leave.
373	00:27:36	00:27:37	We got what we came here for.
374	00:27:41	00:27:44	- What's going on with you? - I'm on a case.
375	00:27:44	00:27:46	We're on a case.
376	00:27:46	00:27:48	Right.
377	00:28:05	00:28:06	Hey, is that from the deli?
378	00:28:06	00:28:08	Egg salad sandwich. You want half?
379	00:28:08	00:28:10	- No. Can I have your pickle? - Yeah.
380	00:28:13	00:28:15	You can have it.
381	00:28:16	00:28:18	Oh, that's a nice one.
382	00:28:37	00:28:39	You've turned my pickle into a light bulb.
383	00:28:39	00:28:41	- I'm electrocuting it. - You sure are.
384	00:28:41	00:28:43	That would explain that smell.
385	00:28:43	00:28:45	This is how I cooked hot dogs in college.
386	00:28:51	00:28:53	Check out the burn marks.
387	00:28:54	00:28:56	There are none.
388	00:28:56	00:28:59	Just like Valenti's body. No evidence of electrocution.
389	00:29:00	00:29:02	Pickles are high in sodium content.
390	00:29:03	00:29:05	Sodium is conductive, just like iron.
391	00:29:05	00:29:08	The flow of electricity through a body generates heat.
392	00:29:16	00:29:19	Burn marks are the physical evidence of that. But...
393	00:29:20	00:29:25	if the body offers no resistance to the flow of electricity - no heat, no burn marks.
394	00:29:26	00:29:30	Roger Valenti's body offered up no resistance because of the excess iron in his blood.
395	00:29:30	00:29:36	It conducted electricity Making his body one big wire. Path to ground.
396	00:29:36	00:29:40	In through his hand from the drill, out through the nail in the boot.
397	00:29:40	00:29:43	No burn marks... but he was still electrocuted.
398	00:30:01	00:30:03	So you've just proved murder.
399	00:30:04	00:30:07	I wouldn't break out that champagne just yet.
400	00:30:07	00:30:10	Don't go shooting the messenger. Thumbprint from the nail.
401	00:30:13	00:30:16	Bob Harris's prints were not on the murder weapon?
402	00:30:16	00:30:18	They were not on the nail.
403	00:30:18	00:30:22	I think someone stuck a nail in the victim's boot and it wasn't Bob Harris.
404	00:30:22	00:30:25	So you made a suspect out of an innocent man.
405	00:30:25	00:30:27	Obviously that wasn't my intent.
406	00:30:27	00:30:31	Oh, good. Maybe you'll wanna bring that up in the newspaper article.
407	00:30:31	00:30:33	What are you talking about? What article?
408	00:30:33	00:30:36	The one I'm arranging for your public apology.
409	00:30:37	00:30:39	- I'm not making an apology. - Oh, yes, you are.
410	00:30:39	00:30:45	You don't go after a friend of mine, sully his reputation and then walk away.
411	00:30:45	00:30:47	Actions have consequences, Gil. Even yours.
412	00:31:06	00:31:08	I heard the Sheriff chewed you a new one.
413	00:31:08	00:31:11	- You get my message? - You want me to check out your Deep Throat.
414	00:31:14	00:31:16	Well, that was fast.
415	00:31:16	00:31:19	Ian Wolf. Union of Electrical Workers, Local 37.
416	00:31:19	00:31:24	He wanted to make sure that I stayed on Harris for the murder of Roger Valenti.
417	00:31:24	00:31:27	- Doesn't that tell you something? - I told him to talk to you.
418	00:31:27	00:31:29	I'll check out the guy.
419	00:31:32	00:31:34	Gil, why do you do this to yourself?
420	00:31:34	00:31:38	- What? - The guy's dead Could have been suicide. Accident.
421	00:31:38	00:31:40	You always gotta push it.
422	00:31:40	00:31:42	It's just like any other case.
423	00:31:42	00:31:44	You know what I think?
424	00:31:44	00:31:45	Adrenaline.
425	00:31:45	00:31:50	You need the rush But that's just me.
426	00:32:47	00:32:49	OK. Thank you, David.
427	00:32:49	00:32:50	No sweat.
428	00:32:50	00:32:53	Hey, he asked for it.
429	00:32:53	00:32:57	How many swabs does it take to process a blanket?
430	00:32:57	00:32:58	I'm thorough.
431	00:32:58	00:33:03	The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood for creatine kinase which would be elevated post-seizure.
432	00:33:03	00:33:05	But Dylan Buckley's levels were normal.
433	00:33:06	00:33:08	I just got my own copy of the report.
434	00:33:09	00:33:10	Dr Sapien lied.
435	00:33:11	00:33:14	You're racing me, Nick. We're driving the same car.
436	00:33:14	00:33:16	Nick!
437	00:33:17	00:33:20	Nick, I'll have you removed from the case.
438	00:33:25	00:33:29	You're confronting suspects before the evidence is processed.
439	00:33:29	00:33:31	You're flying solo, cutting me out.
440	00:33:32	00:33:34	What's going on?
441	00:33:35	00:33:37	OK.
442	00:33:39	00:33:43	There are some people you're supposed to be able to trust, you know.
443	00:33:46	00:33:50	I was nine and she was a last-minute baby-sitter.
444	00:33:53	00:34:01	All I can remember doing afterwards is sitting in my room in the dark, staring at the door, waiting for my... mom to get home.
445	00:34:05	00:34:07	I've never told anyone before.
446	00:34:14	00:34:16	I'm sorry.
447	00:34:17	00:34:19	It's what makes a person, I guess.
448	00:34:22	00:34:23	I'm sorry, Catherine.
449	00:34:29	00:34:33	Check me out. So what? The worst thing I've done is get a speeding ticket.
450	00:34:33	00:34:36	And take a pipe to Valenti's head four days before he died.
451	00:34:36	00:34:40	It wasn't on the foreman's report. Valenti's widow told me.
452	00:34:40	00:34:47	Guys get in beefs all the time But he died Harris had nothing to do with it Despite your efforts to make it seem that way.
453	00:34:47	00:34:51	Look, I'm not saying another word till I talk to a union lawyer.
454	00:34:51	00:34:54	I pay my dues and these guys play hardball.
455	00:35:02	00:35:03	He's guilty.
456	00:35:03	00:35:05	Let's not make the same mistake twice.
457	00:35:07	00:35:11	30 swabs in six hours? Not realistic, all right? Even for me.
458	00:35:11	00:35:14	I thought you'd like the challenge. What are we looking at here?
459	00:35:14	00:35:18	Lots of epithelials. There were skin cells shed all over the blanket.
460	00:35:18	00:35:20	Dylan Buckley's. Dr Sapien's.
461	00:35:20	00:35:22	You're two-thirds of the way there.
462	00:35:22	00:35:26	I also isolated a set of cells from another individual. Identity unknown.
463	00:35:28	00:35:31	But, when it's important to Nick here, I push further.
464	00:35:31	00:35:33	7 of the 13 markers match your dead kid.
465	00:35:35	00:35:36	Familial DNA?
466	00:35:36	00:35:38	Father's dead. Means we're looking at mom.
467	00:35:38	00:35:42	A naked kid under a blanket at a shrink's late at night... and his mother's there.
468	00:35:42	00:35:45	Your case just entered a whole new dimension of weird.
469	00:35:55	00:35:58	- Where's Mandy? - Cross-eyed from running our partial.
470	00:35:58	00:36:00	I didn't wanna lose any time so I took over.
471	00:36:00	00:36:03	The database is 70,000.
472	00:36:03	00:36:05	- It could take a while - If I narrow the scope?
473	00:36:05	00:36:07	- To one. - We got a suspect?
474	00:36:07	00:36:10	Ian Wolf. Like the animal, not the authors.
475	00:36:22	00:36:26	Partial overlay - perfect match. Now we just gotta place him at the crime scene.
476	00:36:26	00:36:30	Warrick's on it. I got a warrant for his tool belt. Metal cutters included.
477	00:36:38	00:36:42	Doc? The kid in his underwear - tell us about the Y-incision.
478	00:36:42	00:36:44	Leftovers from my anniversary dinner.
479	00:36:44	00:36:45	- Congratulations. - Thanks.
480	00:36:46	00:36:49	The same tan fibres I found on the outside I found on the inside.
481	00:36:49	00:36:53	Mouth, nasal passages, both lungs.
482	00:36:53	00:36:55	- He was wrapped in that blanket. - Mm-hm. Head to toe.
483	00:37:02	00:37:05	Mrs Buckley, we know that your son didn't have a seizure.
484	00:37:05	00:37:15	We also know that you were at Dr Sapien's house with Dylan the night that he died He was in his underwear, wrapped in a blanket, fighting for every breath.
485	00:37:15	00:37:17	I loved my son.
486	00:37:18	00:37:20	That's what every parent says.
487	00:37:21	00:37:23	This...
488	00:37:23	00:37:26	This was therapy. I had tried everything else.
489	00:37:26	00:37:30	Taken him to so many specialists, but I couldn't reach him.
490	00:37:30	00:37:32	So we...
491	00:37:32	00:37:33	We tried the...
492	00:37:34	00:37:42	(Sighs) We I have to tell them.
493	00:37:45	00:37:47	It's called rebirthing.
494	00:37:48	00:37:50	Rebirthing?
495	00:37:50	00:37:54	It's a technique used to treat extreme behavioural disorders.
496	00:37:54	00:37:57	The idea is to turn back the clock, wipe the slate clean.
497	00:37:57	00:37:59	Allow the child to re-bond with his mother.
498	00:37:59	00:38:01	What is the blanket for?
499	00:38:01	00:38:02	It represents the birth canal.
500	00:38:05	00:38:07	So you wrapped Dylan up...
501	00:38:09	00:38:11	beat the hell out of him and...
502	00:38:11	00:38:14	hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?
503	00:38:15	00:38:20	Rebirthing may not be a recognised therapeutic procedure, but it's not illegal.
504	00:38:20	00:38:22	Last time I checked, murder is.
505	00:38:22	00:38:24	I begged her to do it.
506	00:38:24	00:38:26	All other methods of therapy had failed.
507	00:38:26	00:38:29	Dylan was becoming more belligerent, withdrawn. Even dangerous.
508	00:38:29	00:38:33	I just wanted my son to love me. That's all.
509	00:38:33	00:38:35	- Dylan was a willing participant. - He was 14.
510	00:38:36	00:38:47	I instructed Dylan to lie down on the floor in the foetal position As part of the process, I asked him if he wanted to be reborn to his mother. He said yes.
511	00:38:47	00:38:49	Now we're going to close the womb.
512	00:38:52	00:38:54	Twist.
513	00:38:54	00:38:56	So, then what happened?
514	00:38:58	00:39:00	Things got out of hand? He changed his mind?
515	00:39:00	00:39:03	Somewhere in the middle of an angora birth canal?
516	00:39:03	00:39:05	It is time to be reborn.
517	00:39:06	00:39:08	That's it. Push harder. Push harder!
518	00:39:09	00:39:10	- Try to get out. - (Fights for breath)
519	00:39:11	00:39:13	A little harder. Come on, Dylan.
520	00:39:13	00:39:15	I can't breathe. I'm gonna die!
521	00:39:15	00:39:19	Do you wanna be reborn or do you wanna stay in there and die?
522	00:39:19	00:39:22	Let me outta here, please. Mom, please! I want this to stop!
523	00:39:22	00:39:25	- Maybe we should. - No. This is what happens. We can't stop now.
524	00:39:25	00:39:28	Trust me. This is a normal response.
525	00:39:29	00:39:32	- I thought it was part of the process. - It is.
526	00:39:32	00:39:35	She said that that's what he was supposed to say.
527	00:39:35	00:39:39	That babies don't want to come out. That's why it's such an ordeal for the woman.
528	00:39:44	00:39:47	So, you pushed on him, like a mother in labour?
529	00:39:47	00:39:50	Come on! Push harder!
530	00:39:50	00:39:52	Stop it! I can't breathe!
531	00:39:53	00:39:54	Push harder!
532	00:39:55	00:39:56	That's it!
533	00:40:00	00:40:02	(Panting) OK.
534	00:40:06	00:40:08	Honey?
535	00:40:08	00:40:10	Dylan? Honey?
536	00:40:14	00:40:18	When we opened the blanket, his eyes were closed.
537	00:40:19	00:40:21	I thought he was pretending to be asleep.
538	00:40:27	00:40:30	So much for your... therapy.
539	00:40:35	00:40:36	Excuse me.
540	00:40:44	00:40:48	And that's why we tried to hide it. We knew you wouldn't understand.
541	00:41:05	00:41:08	The twin moons of Venus Overlap to one.
542	00:41:11	00:41:19	The striations match Wolf stuck a nail in Valenti's boot compromised the drill, and cut the grounding prong with his own cutters.
543	00:41:19	00:41:22	- That seems like a lot of work to kill a guy. - Not for an electrician.
544	00:41:22	00:41:23	I'm gonna find Brass.
545	00:41:24	00:41:25	Hey, Gris...
546	00:41:25	00:41:28	I think I can speak for both of us when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.
547	00:41:28	00:41:32	- We quit before we should have. - Yeah. You did.
548	00:41:45	00:41:46	Mr Wolf!
549	00:41:48	00:41:51	We got you for murder Premeditated.
550	00:41:51	00:41:53	You know this from my cutters?
551	00:41:53	00:41:55	They're just part of the story.
552	00:41:58	00:42:05	You spiked Roger's boot with a nail compromised the insulation You reversed the polarity in his drill.
553	00:42:06	00:42:12	You cut the grounding prong planted evidence And killed a man.
554	00:42:26	00:42:27	You're under arrest.
555	00:42:36	00:42:38	Grissom!
556	00:42:40	00:42:42	It's all you, man.
557	00:42:44	00:42:46	Thank you.
558	00:42:47	00:42:48	Sheriff.
559	00:42:49	00:42:51	Well, you got the bad apple.
560	00:42:51	00:42:52	Yeah. How about that?
561	00:42:52	00:42:55	Just in time for my big public apology.
562	00:42:55	00:42:58	I may be changing the tenor of that piece somewhat.
563	00:42:58	00:43:02	You won't be the goat, but you won't be the hero, either.
564	00:43:03	00:43:04	Good. I'll leave that to you.
565	00:43:05	00:43:07	That's why we will continue to work well together.
566	00:43:11	00:43:13	Grissom.
