0	00:01:01	00:01:03	Welcome to the Wild Kingdom.
1	00:01:03	00:01:05	Vic's Ruth Elliot, 80 years old.
2	00:01:05	00:01:08	Had at least 20 roommates, all of them feline.
3	00:01:08	00:01:10	Animal Control's rounding them up now.
4	00:01:10	00:01:11	Who alerted Homicide?
5	00:01:11	00:01:13	Mail was piling up.
6	00:01:13	00:01:16	Mailman looked in the window and called 9-1-1.
7	00:01:16	00:01:19	Take a deep breath before you go inside.
8	00:01:30	00:01:32	Oh, God! Ugh!
9	00:01:32	00:01:36	I didn't think anything could mask the smell of a decomp.
10	00:01:36	00:01:37	Male cat urine.
11	00:01:37	00:01:38	To us, smelly.
12	00:01:39	00:01:42	To a female cat, it must be like aftershave.
13	00:01:42	00:01:44	Me-ow.
14	00:01:45	00:01:46	David.
15	00:01:47	00:01:48	You don't look so good.
16	00:01:48	00:01:49	Allergic to cats.
17	00:01:50	00:01:51	Oh, bummer.
18	00:01:53	00:01:55	Rigor mortis has passed.
19	00:01:55	00:01:56	Lividity is fixed.
20	00:01:56	00:01:58	Extensive marbling on her limbs.
21	00:01:58	00:02:02	She's been dead three or four days and I need a Benadryl.
22	00:02:02	00:02:04	Excuse me.
23	00:02:20	00:02:21	Whoa.
24	00:02:23	00:02:25	She could have died of natural causes.
25	00:02:25	00:02:30	Three or four days, pets could have been looking for their next meal.
26	00:02:30	00:02:32	Sure. Meat is meat.
27	00:02:36	00:02:39	Or maybe they turned on her.
28	00:02:50	00:02:52	Whoa.
29	00:02:52	00:02:53	Look at this.
30	00:02:55	00:02:56	Flowing wound.
31	00:02:58	00:03:01	That's a deep wound track.
32	00:03:02	00:03:04	This woman was stabbed.
33	00:03:06	00:03:08	I guess the cats are off the hook.
34	00:04:17	00:04:19	Floor was coverd by trash. Lots of partials.
35	00:04:19	00:04:22	Mostly from Animal Control boots.
36	00:04:22	00:04:25	But... I got something here.
37	00:04:25	00:04:28	Distinctive heel and toe.
38	00:04:28	00:04:30	What, a high heel?
39	00:04:30	00:04:31	Well...
40	00:04:31	00:04:35	an old lady wears flats or slippers.
41	00:04:35	00:04:39	I can't imagine that this vic entertained.
42	00:04:39	00:04:42	You got to be careful with isolation.
43	00:04:42	00:04:44	It can escalate.
44	00:04:44	00:04:49	Before you know it, you're the crazy cat lady living in the rundown house.
45	00:04:49	00:04:51	People stop coming by to visit.
46	00:04:51	00:04:57	You go outside, your neighbors run across the street to get away from you.
47	00:04:57	00:05:00	Eventually, you stop going out altogether.
48	00:05:00	00:05:04	Whoo, man! It reeks in here.
49	00:05:04	00:05:05	Who lives like this?
50	00:05:05	00:05:06	Cat lover.
51	00:05:06	00:05:07	You think?
52	00:05:08	00:05:10	So, what do we know?
53	00:05:10	00:05:12	Well, there's no signs of forced entry anywhere.
54	00:05:12	00:05:16	Well, I can see why somebody would want to rob this place.
55	00:05:16	00:05:17	I'll start in the bedroom.
56	00:06:40	00:06:42	No reaction.
57	00:06:42	00:06:44	Knives are clean.
58	00:06:44	00:06:48	Well, killer could have brought his own took it with him when he left.
59	00:06:48	00:06:50	We might want to reconsider burglary gone bad.
60	00:06:50	00:06:53	I found a busted safe in the bedroom. Empty.
61	00:06:53	00:06:54	I lifted prints.
62	00:06:54	00:07:01	A high-heeled thief who knew exactly what to look for and killed the only obstacle in their path.
63	00:07:07	00:07:09	Welcome to a 4-45.
64	00:07:09	00:07:11	Explosives. It's been a while.
65	00:07:11	00:07:12	Fatalities?
66	00:07:12	00:07:15	Just this $50,000 Beemer.
67	00:07:16	00:07:19	Marcie Tobin. Her car.
68	00:07:19	00:07:24	And Marcus Remmick, mechanic an eyewitness.
69	00:07:24	00:07:26	So, divide and conquer?
70	00:07:26	00:07:27	Yeah, I'll take the rig.
71	00:07:28	00:07:29	I'll take the grease monkey.
72	00:07:29	00:07:30	I guess I got the driver.
73	00:07:30	00:07:33	This just does that make any sense.
74	00:07:33	00:07:36	I mean, why would somebody put a bomb in my car?
75	00:07:36	00:07:37	Ms. Tobin?
76	00:07:37	00:07:39	Hi. I'm with the Crime Lab.
77	00:07:39	00:07:41	Mind if I ask you a few questions?
78	00:07:41	00:07:43	Have you reached my husband?
79	00:07:43	00:07:44	I'll check on it, ma'am.
80	00:07:44	00:07:47	Thanks.
81	00:07:47	00:07:49	Can you tell me what happened?
82	00:07:49	00:07:51	I was on my way to my father's office.
83	00:07:51	00:07:55	On Thursdays we have dinner and then I help him with his payroll.
84	00:07:57	00:07:59	Excuse me?
85	00:07:59	00:08:00	We're closed.
86	00:08:00	00:08:03	My car is making a really strange noise.
87	00:08:03	00:08:05	Take it to the dealership in the morning.
88	00:08:05	00:08:07	Lady's driving a brand-new Beemer.
89	00:08:07	00:08:09	First service is 15,000 miles.
90	00:08:09	00:08:10	Things don't go wrong.
91	00:08:10	00:08:12	Yeah.
92	00:08:12	00:08:14	But you checked it out anyway, huh?
93	00:08:14	00:08:16	You know how women get.
94	00:08:16	00:08:18	Go ahead, pop the hood.
95	00:08:22	00:08:23	Back away.
96	00:08:23	00:08:24	Why? Run, run!
97	00:08:25	00:08:26	Why? Run!
98	00:08:31	00:08:34	Ms. Tobin, where did you last park your car?
99	00:08:34	00:08:36	In my house, in my garage.
100	00:08:36	00:08:38	And who would have access?
101	00:08:38	00:08:41	Just me... and my husband.
102	00:08:41	00:08:43	But Johnny had nothing to do with this.
103	00:08:43	00:08:45	He's been at work all day.
104	00:08:45	00:08:47	You can ask him as soon as he gets here.
105	00:09:01	00:09:02	Anything probative?
106	00:09:02	00:09:05	Check out this displacement.
107	00:09:08	00:09:10	Detritus blew backwards.
108	00:09:14	00:09:15	Uh-huh.
109	00:09:17	00:09:18	That's intentional.
110	00:09:19	00:09:20	Bombs are personal.
111	00:09:20	00:09:22	So...
112	00:09:23	00:09:29	assuming Mrs. Tobin was the intended target the bomber knew what he was doing.
113	00:09:29	00:09:32	Yeah, a hired hit on a housewife.
114	00:09:35	00:09:36	Glad I'm a dog person.
115	00:09:36	00:09:40	You know, house cats have only been domesticated for 4,000 years.
116	00:09:40	00:09:43	They still have predatory instincts.
117	00:09:43	00:09:44	Only 4,000?
118	00:09:44	00:09:45	Yeah.
119	00:09:45	00:09:47	But a cat didn't kill her.
120	00:09:47	00:09:48	You're right.
121	00:09:48	00:09:51	No vital reactions around the bite marks.
122	00:09:51	00:09:53	Predation is all postmortem.
123	00:09:53	00:09:55	Cause of death, cardiac trauma.
124	00:09:55	00:10:05	She was stabbed lateral to the sternal border, just below the fifth intercostal space straight into the right ventricle.
125	00:10:05	00:10:08	Muscle layers decrease with age.
126	00:10:08	00:10:11	Fascia and tissue layers are easy to penetrate.
127	00:10:11	00:10:15	Can't tell you much about the weapon but the wound track is slick.
128	00:10:16	00:10:19	I swabbed the foreign substance sent it to Greg.
129	00:10:20	00:10:21	Anything else?
130	00:10:21	00:10:24	Well, vic's lungs were full of fluid.
131	00:10:24	00:10:28	Probably not relevant to your investigation but the lab cultured her blood.
132	00:10:29	00:10:31	She had a severe staph infection.
133	00:10:33	00:10:35	Grissom.
134	00:10:37	00:10:39	We'll be right there.
135	00:10:39	00:10:41	Homicide has a witness.
136	00:10:41	00:10:44	Tell them what you told me.
137	00:10:45	00:10:47	Come on, Jessica.
138	00:10:47	00:10:49	What did you see?
139	00:10:49	00:10:54	Oh, the lady over there the one that died, she was nice.
140	00:10:54	00:10:57	She had cats.
141	00:10:57	00:10:58	Lots of them. Yep.
142	00:10:58	00:11:00	My name's Catherine.
143	00:11:00	00:11:02	What is your name again?
144	00:11:02	00:11:03	Jessica Rachel Trent.
145	00:11:03	00:11:04	I'm eight and a half.
146	00:11:04	00:11:07	Oh, eight and a half so I bet you're in the third grade?
147	00:11:07	00:11:09	Yeah. My teacher's Mrs. Armstrong.
148	00:11:10	00:11:11	She's really nice.
149	00:11:11	00:11:14	Except I hate multiplication especially the eights.
150	00:11:14	00:11:17	You know, I have a daughter. She hates the eights, too.
151	00:11:17	00:11:19	So, Jessica, can you tell me what you told your mom?
152	00:11:19	00:11:23	I can. Jessica and I were playing handball against the garage door.
153	00:11:23	00:11:27	We saw Mrs. Stein go into Mrs. Elliot's house and they were yelling.
154	00:11:27	00:11:31	When Mrs. Stein came out she looked really angry.
155	00:11:31	00:11:34	Kind of like when Mommy's boyfriend is late for dinner.
156	00:11:34	00:11:35	She hates that.
157	00:11:36	00:11:39	And, uh...
158	00:11:39	00:11:40	who is Mrs. Stein?
159	00:11:40	00:11:43	Mrs. Elliot's next-door neighbor.
160	00:11:43	00:11:45	Ran a background check.
161	00:11:45	00:11:49	The good neighbor filed three nuisance complaints against the victim.
162	00:11:51	00:11:53	Hey, are you girls sharing secrets?
163	00:11:53	00:11:54	Can you share it with me?
164	00:11:55	00:11:57	All right.
165	00:12:02	00:12:03	Thank you.
166	00:12:03	00:12:05	No problem.
167	00:12:07	00:12:10	I think that we're done here.
168	00:12:10	00:12:12	Okay. Thanks for your help.
169	00:12:12	00:12:13	Sure.
170	00:12:17	00:12:19	I'll get a warrant for Mrs. Stein's shoes.
171	00:12:19	00:12:21	See if we can place her at the crime scene.
172	00:12:22	00:12:25	Don't you have a secret to share with me now?
173	00:12:25	00:12:28	Oh, uh, Mrs. Stein?
174	00:12:28	00:12:30	She hates cats.
175	00:12:51	00:12:52	Another spring.
176	00:12:52	00:12:56	Did you know there's a dozen moving parts inside a ticking clock?
177	00:12:56	00:12:58	I do now.
178	00:13:00	00:13:01	Hmm...
179	00:13:01	00:13:03	Hello, sweetheart.
180	00:13:03	00:13:04	End cap?
181	00:13:04	00:13:06	Pipe bomb.
182	00:13:06	00:13:08	End cap at both ends.
183	00:13:08	00:13:12	Either one could have come in contact with the explosive inside the pipe.
184	00:13:12	00:13:17	I'll swab it see if Trace can identify it.
185	00:13:17	00:13:20	I will see your end cap and raise you a grommet.
186	00:13:20	00:13:24	A grommet? Inside a pipe bomb?
187	00:13:24	00:13:26	Not in the bomb, itself, but embedded in the end cap.
188	00:13:26	00:13:29	The wires from the timing device enter the pipe through a hole in the grommet.
189	00:13:29	00:13:35	When the timing device is activated, it sets off an electrical charge that detonates the explosives inside the pipe.
190	00:13:35	00:13:37	Yet the grommet's fully intact.
191	00:13:37	00:13:39	How did it survive the blast?
192	00:13:39	00:13:40	I don't know, but they always do.
193	00:13:41	00:13:43	And just when I thought you knew everything.
194	00:13:43	00:13:44	How's the puzzle?
195	00:13:44	00:13:47	Hey. Pieces are small, but it's coming together.
196	00:13:47	00:13:48	Well, I got a corner piece.
197	00:13:48	00:13:50	The 4-1-1 on Marcie Tobin's husband?
198	00:13:50	00:13:54	Junior foreman on Tobin C &amp;amp; D, Incorporated.
199	00:13:54	00:13:59	The C stands for construction the D is for demolition.
200	00:13:59	00:14:01	I got to do my job, you got to do your job.
201	00:14:01	00:14:05	So, if this stuff isn't taken down there then we all lose.
202	00:14:05	00:14:07	So, you just make sure that you are in touch with me...
203	00:14:07	00:14:08	Jonathan Claddon?
204	00:14:09	00:14:10	Yeah.
205	00:14:10	00:14:11	I'm Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle.
206	00:14:12	00:14:13	We're with the Vegas Crime Lab.
207	00:14:13	00:14:15	We're here about your wife's car.
208	00:14:15	00:14:16	Yeah, she told me you might stop by.
209	00:14:16	00:14:19	Mr. Claddon are you a demolitions expert?
210	00:14:19	00:14:20	That's what we do.
211	00:14:20	00:14:22	You must have seen our work on TV.
212	00:14:22	00:14:24	We imploded most of the old Strip hotels.
213	00:14:24	00:14:27	Do you personally know how to make a bomb?
214	00:14:27	00:14:28	It's not hard.
215	00:14:28	00:14:30	Anybody here could show you how.
216	00:14:31	00:14:32	So, I take that as a yes?
217	00:14:32	00:14:36	If you're implying I had anything to do with all of this...
218	00:14:36	00:14:38	I love my wife.
219	00:14:38	00:14:41	Not enough, apparently, to be there for her last night.
220	00:14:41	00:14:44	Johnny, Reynolds needs help loading the truck.
221	00:14:44	00:14:45	These folks are from the Crime Lab.
222	00:14:45	00:14:47	They're here about Marcie.
223	00:14:47	00:14:48	I'd like to talk to them.
224	00:14:48	00:14:51	Alone.
225	00:14:51	00:14:53	Well, let me know if I can help.
226	00:14:53	00:14:54	Will do.
227	00:14:54	00:14:56	Oh.
228	00:14:56	00:14:57	Barclay Tobin.
229	00:14:57	00:14:58	This is my company.
230	00:14:58	00:15:00	Any leads on my daughter's case?
231	00:15:00	00:15:02	At this point, we're still asking questions.
232	00:15:02	00:15:04	Can you tell us about your son-in-law?
233	00:15:04	00:15:07	Well, I got him his first and only job when he married Marcie.
234	00:15:07	00:15:10	You, uh... you don't think too much of him, huh?
235	00:15:10	00:15:11	Even less these days.
236	00:15:11	00:15:16	Marcie says that he's cheating on her but I don't think he has the stones.
237	00:15:18	00:15:20	But after last night...
238	00:15:20	00:15:22	Does Johnny have access to explosives?
239	00:15:22	00:15:24	All my foremen have access to dynamite.
240	00:15:27	00:15:29	Mr. Tobin, do you fingerprint your employees?
241	00:15:29	00:15:30	Sure do.
242	00:15:30	00:15:33	It's standard for the industry.
243	00:15:33	00:15:35	Just let me know what you need.
244	00:15:38	00:15:42	Before you ask that swab of yours, from the end cap...
245	00:15:42	00:15:45	let's play Name That Chemical Compound.
246	00:15:45	00:15:47	Explosives.
247	00:15:47	00:15:48	30 seconds on the clock.
248	00:15:48	00:15:49	Get...
249	00:15:54	00:15:57	C-3...
250	00:15:59	00:16:01	H-5...
251	00:16:03	00:16:06	and three molecules of NO-3...
252	00:16:06	00:16:07	Nitroglycerin.
253	00:16:07	00:16:10	The explosive component of dynamite.
254	00:16:10	00:16:15	Now, the other component for dynamite is either silica or sawdust.
255	00:16:15	00:16:17	Your sample contains sawdust.
256	00:16:17	00:16:18	Thanks, Greg.
257	00:16:18	00:16:20	What'd I win?
258	00:17:21	00:17:22	Hey.
259	00:17:22	00:17:23	Hey.
260	00:17:23	00:17:24	Well, you look...
261	00:17:24	00:17:25	Happy?
262	00:17:25	00:17:27	Smug, actually.
263	00:17:27	00:17:30	I got a perfect print off the end cap.
264	00:17:30	00:17:32	Husband.
265	00:17:32	00:17:33	Nice.
266	00:17:33	00:17:37	I got the type of explosive used in the pipe bomb.
267	00:17:37	00:17:39	Dynamite-- nitro and sawdust.
268	00:17:39	00:17:42	The same kind used at Tobin C &amp; D.
269	00:17:43	00:17:44	Mm-hmm...
270	00:17:44	00:17:46	You found the end cap?
271	00:17:46	00:17:47	That's not easy.
272	00:17:47	00:17:51	Hey, if I were you I'd worry about my fingerprint.
273	00:17:51	00:17:53	How'd it get there?
274	00:17:53	00:17:56	My father-in-law's company is the largest purchaser of end caps in Nevada.
275	00:17:56	00:17:58	I log inventory.
276	00:17:58	00:18:00	Well, speaking of inventory I checked the books.
277	00:18:00	00:18:04	As you know, per the ATF every stick of dynamite is catalogued.
278	00:18:04	00:18:05	You logged-out a case of 24.
279	00:18:05	00:18:10	When the demolition project was postponed you returned the case...
280	00:18:10	00:18:12	one stick short.
281	00:18:12	00:18:14	It was stolen.
282	00:18:15	00:18:16	Look, I'm the one who reported the theft.
283	00:18:17	00:18:21	I kept the dynamite in my SUV, inside a storage magazine.
284	00:18:21	00:18:26	So, you're telling us someone broke into your vehicle and stole a single stick of dynamite?
285	00:18:26	00:18:29	Yes.
286	00:18:30	00:18:32	Tell us about your girlfriend.
287	00:18:33	00:18:36	Is that what Mr. Tobin told you?
288	00:18:38	00:18:41	Marcie's the best thing that ever happened to me.
289	00:18:41	00:18:43	Plus, I've got an ulcer.
290	00:18:43	00:18:45	Do you have any idea what an affair would do to me?
291	00:18:45	00:18:48	I work my butt off for her old man.
292	00:18:48	00:18:52	I barely have enough time to sleep let alone Romeo some other girl.
293	00:18:53	00:18:56	And the truth is, nothing I ever do is good enough.
294	00:18:56	00:18:59	Tobin wouldn't even let Marcie take my name.
295	00:18:59	00:19:00	Cry me a river, Johnny.
296	00:19:02	00:19:04	You're looking at the wrong guy.
297	00:19:04	00:19:06	Then point us in the right direction.
298	00:19:08	00:19:14	Marcie handles the payroll and she has a rep for shortchanging overtime.
299	00:19:14	00:19:17	Talk about pissing people off.
300	00:19:17	00:19:20	Any one of those guys could have put that bomb in her car.
301	00:19:20	00:19:23	Why didn't you tell us this before?
302	00:19:23	00:19:24	Because it's not her fault.
303	00:19:24	00:19:27	She's just doing what her father tells her.
304	00:19:45	00:19:46	Debbie Stein?
305	00:19:46	00:19:47	Yes.
306	00:19:47	00:19:49	I'm here for your shoes.
307	00:20:23	00:20:24	Phew.
308	00:20:25	00:20:27	Eau de cat.
309	00:20:40	00:20:43	Eau de match.
310	00:20:45	00:20:46	She was a pig.
311	00:20:46	00:20:47	Her house stunk.
312	00:20:48	00:20:50	She didn't belong in the neighborhood.
313	00:20:50	00:20:53	So, I guess it's safe to say you weren't friends?
314	00:20:55	00:20:57	Why were you in her house?
315	00:20:58	00:21:02	I wanted to give her a chance to find homes for her cats before I called the Humane Society.
316	00:21:02	00:21:04	To report her.
317	00:21:04	00:21:05	By law, you can only own three.
318	00:21:05	00:21:08	Well, a witness heard you scream at her.
319	00:21:08	00:21:10	She was irrational.
320	00:21:11	00:21:12	I was angry.
321	00:21:12	00:21:13	This is disgusting. Nobody lives like this.
322	00:21:14	00:21:15	You've got to get rid of them.
323	00:21:15	00:21:18	These cats are my children, and no one's going to take them away from me.
324	00:21:18	00:21:19	Then you clean up after them.
325	00:21:20	00:21:22	I can smell your house from my kitchen.
326	00:21:22	00:21:25	When, exactly, did you confront Mrs. Elliot?
327	00:21:25	00:21:27	I don't know.
328	00:21:27	00:21:28	Maybe...
329	00:21:28	00:21:30	six days ago.
330	00:21:30	00:21:33	Before my trip to L.A.
331	00:21:33	00:21:35	I went to visit my sister.
332	00:21:35	00:21:40	Look, if you have any other questions I want a lawyer.
333	00:21:40	00:21:42	You're free to go.
334	00:21:48	00:21:50	Well, she had an answer for everything.
335	00:21:50	00:21:56	You know, according to Mark Twain the most striking difference between a cat and a lie is that a cat only has nine lives.
336	00:21:56	00:21:58	What are you saying? That she's lying?
337	00:21:58	00:22:01	Unless her alibi checks out.
338	00:22:20	00:22:24	Bomber fastened the cap to the pipe leaving behind tool marks.
339	00:22:24	00:22:26	Check it out.
340	00:22:26	00:22:31	What kind of tool leaves evenly-spaced vertical striations?
341	00:22:31	00:22:33	A vice grip.
342	00:22:35	00:22:36	A vice grip?
343	00:22:36	00:22:38	Yeah.
344	00:22:38	00:22:42	Let's get a warrant for Johnny Claddon's home and for Tobin C &amp;amp; D.
345	00:22:47	00:22:49	Hey, guys.
346	00:22:51	00:22:52	Hey!
347	00:22:52	00:22:53	Talked with O'Riley.
348	00:22:53	00:22:55	The neighbor's alibi does check out.
349	00:22:55	00:22:56	She was at her sister's in L.A.
350	00:22:56	00:22:57	during the time of the murder.
351	00:22:58	00:22:59	Well, there goes our only suspect.
352	00:22:59	00:23:00	Not so fast.
353	00:23:00	00:23:02	I got another one.
354	00:23:02	00:23:06	We have a match on that print that we found on the wall safe.
355	00:23:06	00:23:07	Right!
356	00:23:08	00:23:09	Yeah.
357	00:23:09	00:23:11	He has a non-gaming work card.
358	00:23:11	00:23:12	He's 45 years old.
359	00:23:12	00:23:15	He was an electrician at the Tangiers from '97 to '99.
360	00:23:15	00:23:17	His name is Tyler Elliot.
361	00:23:17	00:23:20	That's the same last name as the vic. Victim's son.
362	00:23:20	00:23:22	Only child.
363	00:23:22	00:23:24	I wasn't skipping town.
364	00:23:24	00:23:27	That why you had a duffel bag in the back seat?
365	00:23:27	00:23:30	I was going camping out at Red Rock.
366	00:23:30	00:23:32	And suddenly, these cops pull me over.
367	00:23:32	00:23:34	They take me into custody.
368	00:23:34	00:23:35	My car's still up there.
369	00:23:36	00:23:39	Your mother died, and you never claimed the body.
370	00:23:39	00:23:40	How come?
371	00:23:41	00:23:43	Funerals are expensive.
372	00:23:43	00:23:44	I'm broke.
373	00:23:44	00:23:48	Records show he filed for bankruptcy last month.
374	00:23:48	00:23:51	I figured let the county pick up the tab.
375	00:23:51	00:23:54	No one was going to show up anyway.
376	00:23:58	00:24:00	It's not like we were close.
377	00:24:00	00:24:02	So, how often did you see her?
378	00:24:02	00:24:04	Twice a month.
379	00:24:04	00:24:07	Went over, made sure her bills got paid.
380	00:24:07	00:24:09	Brought her medication.
381	00:24:09	00:24:11	Stocked the fridge.
382	00:24:11	00:24:13	All the stuff any good son's supposed to do.
383	00:24:14	00:24:18	Mr. Elliot we found your mother's safe.
384	00:24:18	00:24:21	It was busted open and your prints were all over it.
385	00:24:23	00:24:24	Something funny?
386	00:24:24	00:24:29	About a month ago, she called me up-- middle of the night-- hysterical.
387	00:24:29	00:24:32	Her precious tabby was locked inside.
388	00:24:32	00:24:35	She couldn't remember the combo.
389	00:24:38	00:24:40	I didn't steal her money.
390	00:24:40	00:24:42	She didn't have any.
391	00:24:42	00:24:45	The only thing she owned was the house.
392	00:24:45	00:24:49	And she left that to some damn cat sanctuary.
393	00:24:51	00:24:53	And so...
394	00:24:53	00:24:55	that's it?
395	00:24:56	00:25:01	I'm flat broke and she gives her house to complete strangers.
396	00:25:01	00:25:04	Can, uh...
397	00:25:05	00:25:10	can somebody drive me back to my car if we're done?
398	00:25:10	00:25:16	You know, since my car blew up everybody is in my business.
399	00:25:16	00:25:18	All of a sudden, everybody has something to say.
400	00:25:18	00:25:21	You know, an opinion, a theory.
401	00:25:21	00:25:24	My life is an open book and my father wants me to hire a bodyguard.
402	00:25:24	00:25:25	For what?
403	00:25:26	00:25:27	To protect me from who?
404	00:25:27	00:25:34	You know what I think? Someone put the bomb in the wrong car. I think they confused our house with somebody else's because stranger things have happened. Marcie?
405	00:25:34	00:25:36	Yeah. Sorry.
406	00:25:36	00:25:39	Maybe we should talk alone.
407	00:25:39	00:25:42	Uh, we don't have any secrets.
408	00:25:42	00:25:44	Okay.
409	00:25:44	00:25:47	Listen-- about your marriage-- your father said...
410	00:25:47	00:25:49	Oh, my God. My father shouldn't have said anything.
411	00:25:49	00:25:52	Your father ran his mouth about our personal life?
412	00:25:52	00:25:53	Johnny, you know what? I, um...
413	00:25:53	00:25:58	A couple of weeks ago I thought that maybe Johnny was fooling around just because he was never home...
414	00:25:58	00:26:00	I was working. and never interested...
415	00:26:00	00:26:04	Marcie, we talked about this. You know the pressure your father has me under. I know. I know.
416	00:26:04	00:26:06	It's not fair. And you know what?
417	00:26:06	00:26:11	You shouldn't put too much stock in this because every couple has their problems. Marcie and I have had enough.
418	00:26:11	00:26:13	That's it. Now, you have your warrant, fine.
419	00:26:13	00:26:16	But please no more questions.
420	00:26:18	00:26:20	Just take what you need.
421	00:26:30	00:26:33	Hey. You got a head start.
422	00:26:33	00:26:35	Yeah, didn't even have to wait for my warrant.
423	00:26:35	00:26:40	I just rolled over to Tobin C &amp;amp; D and before I could say vice grip the senior foreman gave me every grip in the house.
424	00:26:40	00:26:41	Bad news, though. No matches.
425	00:26:41	00:26:46	Ah! One more vice grip compliments of the Tobin/Claddon household.
426	00:27:11	00:27:12	Aw...
427	00:27:12	00:27:15	teeth aren't even the same size.
428	00:27:15	00:27:16	No.
429	00:27:16	00:27:18	And we're out of vice grips.
430	00:27:18	00:27:19	We're out of luck.
431	00:27:19	00:27:21	Let's unwrap the Beemer.
432	00:27:24	00:27:28	You know, when I was 16, I begged my mom for a car.
433	00:27:28	00:27:29	Swore she'd come through.
434	00:27:29	00:27:30	What happened?
435	00:27:30	00:27:32	Encyclopedia Britannica.
436	00:27:33	00:27:35	All 24 volumes.
437	00:27:35	00:27:37	Still own them, still use them.
438	00:27:40	00:27:42	Okay.
439	00:27:42	00:27:46	Mechanic found the bomb next to the engine mount closest point to the driver.
440	00:27:46	00:27:47	Bomb was on a delay.
441	00:27:47	00:27:51	Clock with a ticking second hand and a nail driven into 12.
442	00:27:53	00:27:58	That means the bomb was triggered 60 seconds before detonation, one rotation of the second hand.
443	00:27:59	00:28:02	Question is, what started the clock?
444	00:28:04	00:28:06	Something Marcie Tobin touched inside the car?
445	00:28:16	00:28:21	Ignition, door locks window, radio, A/C...
446	00:28:21	00:28:24	turning signals hazard lights...
447	00:28:24	00:28:27	Yeah, but we're only dealing with a 60-second time frame.
448	00:28:28	00:28:31	Okay, she pulls into the lot she gets out of the car, and she asks for help.
449	00:28:31	00:28:33	Mechanic offers to take a look.
450	00:28:33	00:28:35	So, she pops the hood for him.
451	00:28:38	00:28:39	Hood release.
452	00:28:42	00:28:43	Whoa.
453	00:28:44	00:28:46	The latch has been blown apart.
454	00:28:46	00:28:50	Which means the hood was down when the bomb was detonated.
455	00:28:52	00:28:54	How is that possible?
456	00:28:54	00:28:56	The mechanic saw the bomb.
457	00:28:56	00:28:59	X-ray vision?
458	00:28:59	00:29:01	Okay, maybe he took one look at it, and he slammed the hood.
459	00:29:01	00:29:05	Sara, if you found a bomb in your car would you close the hood?
460	00:29:05	00:29:07	No, I would back away fast.
461	00:29:07	00:29:10	Um... maybe the hood dropped?
462	00:29:10	00:29:12	No way.
463	00:29:12	00:29:14	BMW has built-in hood shocks.
464	00:29:14	00:29:17	Liar, liar, car on fire.
465	00:29:46	00:29:49	I could have been a rock star.
466	00:29:49	00:29:51	There's still time, Greg.
467	00:29:52	00:29:55	Tell us about the foreign substance we found in the vic's wound track.
468	00:29:55	00:30:00	Uh, well, I like to rub it all over a lady's body.
469	00:30:00	00:30:02	Even better...
470	00:30:05	00:30:06	I, uh...
471	00:30:06	00:30:10	like it when she rubs it all over me.
472	00:30:10	00:30:13	And it's also used as a stool softener.
473	00:30:13	00:30:15	It's also the only open lead in our case.
474	00:30:15	00:30:16	Spit it out, Greg.
475	00:30:16	00:30:18	Mineral oil.
476	00:30:18	00:30:21	Possibly used as a preservative to prevent rusting of high-carbon steel.
477	00:30:21	00:30:24	Like the blades of knives.
478	00:30:24	00:30:27	Old knives. New ones are made from stainless steel.
479	00:30:27	00:30:29	Yeah, I'm like a sponge.
480	00:30:29	00:30:30	I just absorb information.
481	00:30:30	00:30:32	I thought that was my line.
482	00:30:32	00:30:34	Yeah, and I absorbed it.
483	00:30:34	00:30:35	Okay, so...
484	00:30:36	00:30:39	knives, screwdriver ice pick letter opener.
485	00:30:39	00:30:41	We're looking for a weapon with a splash of mineral oil.
486	00:30:41	00:30:42	I'll grab the A.L.S.
487	00:30:44	00:30:46	An A.L.S. for mineral oil?
488	00:30:46	00:30:52	Mineral oil fluoresces at 525 nanometers when filtered through a KV590.
489	00:30:52	00:30:55	A little more absorbing, a little less rock and roll.
490	00:31:36	00:31:37	Now what?
491	00:31:43	00:31:46	I thought Animal Control rounded up all the cats.
492	00:31:46	00:31:48	Where are you going?
493	00:31:48	00:31:50	Following the evidence.
494	00:31:58	00:32:00	Wait. Rascal.
495	00:32:01	00:32:02	Hi.
496	00:32:04	00:32:05	How'd you get out?
497	00:32:05	00:32:06	Hi. Girls.
498	00:32:07	00:32:08	Say hi, Rascal.
499	00:32:08	00:32:09	Hi, Rascal.
500	00:32:12	00:32:16	Excuse me, uh... may I hold your cat?
501	00:32:16	00:32:18	No. He doesn't like you.
502	00:32:19	00:32:22	Girls, dinner.
503	00:32:22	00:32:24	Can't she see we're playing?
504	00:32:24	00:32:25	Just ignore her.
505	00:32:25	00:32:26	Girls.
506	00:32:27	00:32:29	I see you've met Rascal.
507	00:32:29	00:32:31	Mrs. Trent, I noticed this cat has a sore on its leg.
508	00:32:31	00:32:33	I'd be happy to swab it for you.
509	00:32:33	00:32:35	Might need medical attention. No.
510	00:32:35	00:32:37	I don't think that that's really necessary.
511	00:32:37	00:32:38	It's just a cut; it'll heal.
512	00:32:38	00:32:42	But I mean, for your daughter's sake wouldn't you rather be safe than sorry?
513	00:32:42	00:32:44	I think it's time to go inside.
514	00:32:44	00:32:47	Uh, Jessica... I-I think he might have a point.
515	00:32:51	00:32:53	I want her to do it.
516	00:32:57	00:33:00	Okay.
517	00:33:00	00:33:02	Rascal.
518	00:33:09	00:33:11	All righty.
519	00:33:11	00:33:13	Thank you.
520	00:33:14	00:33:16	Okay, girls, go wash up.
521	00:33:17	00:33:19	Come on, Jackie, let's go.
522	00:33:20	00:33:22	Kids these days, they just don't listen.
523	00:33:22	00:33:24	Two against one.
524	00:33:26	00:33:28	Thank you. See you later.
525	00:33:29	00:33:33	One thing about my mother even though she was deaf, she was always the boss.
526	00:33:33	00:33:35	Huh. Well...
527	00:33:35	00:33:37	single mom...
528	00:33:37	00:33:38	juggling a job, a boyfriend.
529	00:33:38	00:33:43	It's just easier to say yes than no and then eventually, they just stop asking for permission.
530	00:33:43	00:33:46	You want to tell me why I swabbed their cat?
531	00:33:46	00:33:51	That cat has an open sore and a missing patch of fur-- both indicative of possible staph infection.
532	00:33:51	00:33:55	And we know that our victim had a staph infection.
533	00:33:55	00:34:01	Staphylococcus bacteria can jump the species barrier-- be passed from human to animal.
534	00:34:01	00:34:03	Guess I must have shut it, then.
535	00:34:03	00:34:06	I wasn't thinking; I was reacting, you know?
536	00:34:06	00:34:07	No harm, no foul.
537	00:34:07	00:34:09	No prints. Come again?
538	00:34:09	00:34:13	Well, if you were pawing all over the hood then your prints should be on it.
539	00:34:13	00:34:14	And they're not.
540	00:34:14	00:34:16	I wear gloves.
541	00:34:16	00:34:17	You're not wearing them now.
542	00:34:17	00:34:20	I wear them most of the time.
543	00:34:20	00:34:23	Mind if we take a look around the garage? Knock yourselves out.
544	00:34:30	00:34:32	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
545	00:34:32	00:34:34	Mechanics use vice grips?
546	00:34:37	00:34:40	You got any clay? No.
547	00:34:40	00:34:44	Well... we can't just take the tool without a warrant.
548	00:34:47	00:34:48	But...
549	00:34:51	00:34:55	we can improvise.
550	00:34:55	00:34:56	Trash is trash.
551	00:34:56	00:34:58	Cheese. Nice.
552	00:35:02	00:35:06	I'll compare this with our case toolmark.
553	00:35:09	00:35:11	You guys having fun?
554	00:35:11	00:35:12	A blast.
555	00:35:12	00:35:13	Hey, man...
556	00:35:14	00:35:15	These yours?
557	00:35:15	00:35:18	Don't use vice grips-- pipe wrench has a better feel.
558	00:35:18	00:35:20	Must belong to one of my mechanics.
559	00:35:20	00:35:21	I'll take the prints on those.
560	00:35:22	00:35:24	Boy, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?
561	00:35:24	00:35:25	Yeah, I guess I do.
562	00:35:50	00:35:53	Striae are identical.
563	00:35:53	00:35:57	Auto Body vice grip was definitely used to tighten the end cap.
564	00:35:57	00:35:59	Mechanic's prints on file?
565	00:35:59	00:36:01	Marcus Remmick. Arrested for fraud in 1994.
566	00:36:01	00:36:04	He was selling used parts as new.
567	00:36:04	00:36:06	Prints are in AFIS, but they don't match the vice grip.
568	00:36:06	00:36:08	And, in fact, AFIS drew a blank.
569	00:36:08	00:36:11	Hmm. Then what are you running?
570	00:36:11	00:36:13	I'm running a Tobin C&amp;amp;D database.
571	00:36:13	00:36:14	Oh. Shot in the dark.
572	00:36:20	00:36:23	( beeping ) Even a shot in the dark hits sometimes.
573	00:36:23	00:36:26	Why would I put a bomb in my car?
574	00:36:26	00:36:31	Not only did you put a bomb in your car-- you made it yourself.
575	00:36:31	00:36:32	Why would I do that?
576	00:36:32	00:36:35	The business registration shows that you own 25% of your father's company.
577	00:36:35	00:36:41	So Nevada's a community property state-- you divorce Johnny he becomes a part-owner of Tobin Construction.
578	00:36:41	00:36:43	That wouldn't sit too well with Dad, would it?
579	00:36:43	00:36:50	But if Johnny goes down for attempted murder, he goes to jail and you get to keep everything, because a criminal can't benefit from his own malfeasance.
580	00:36:50	00:36:53	This is absurd.
581	00:36:53	00:36:58	You know, for your information, um your mechanic friend lawyered up.
582	00:36:58	00:36:59	Guys with records roll fast.
583	00:37:00	00:37:01	Really?
584	00:37:01	00:37:05	Because we found your prints on a tool at the body shop.
585	00:37:05	00:37:08	It was the same tool we know was used to make the pipe bomb.
586	00:37:11	00:37:13	Sit down.
587	00:37:17	00:37:19	You and Marcus tag-teamed us.
588	00:37:19	00:37:22	You never popped the hood; he never shut it-- it was latched.
589	00:37:22	00:37:27	Fortunately for you, you only worked Thursday nights, because your little plan took a lot of extra time and effort?
590	00:37:27	00:37:36	You snagged a stick of dynamite out of Johnny's SUV took an end cap out of inventory, knowing we'd trace it back to Johnny if we found it.
591	00:37:36	00:37:40	And then at the body shop, you put it all together.
592	00:37:41	00:37:43	So what if I made a bomb?
593	00:37:43	00:37:45	That's not a crime.
594	00:37:45	00:37:46	Really?
595	00:37:46	00:37:48	You sure about that?
596	00:37:53	00:37:56	Ready.
597	00:37:56	00:37:58	60 seconds.
598	00:38:08	00:38:10	You used to own a '92 Volvo.
599	00:38:10	00:38:12	I ran your credit card.
600	00:38:12	00:38:14	You owe $20,000 in auto body repairs.
601	00:38:14	00:38:16	Your dad kicked in $30,000.
602	00:38:16	00:38:18	I ran his credit card, too.
603	00:38:18	00:38:20	That's 50 g's for a leaky transmission.
604	00:38:20	00:38:25	You needed Marcus' help to wire the bomb and substantiate your story.
605	00:38:25	00:38:29	So the two of you paid him $50,000 for services rendered.
606	00:38:29	00:38:38	Look, I'm fine, and my husband is fine and it was my car that exploded so does this... really need to go any further?
607	00:38:38	00:38:44	Ma'am, you and your father conspired to frame your husband for attempted murder.
608	00:38:44	00:38:47	So, you're both looking at, what, uh...
609	00:38:47	00:38:49	20-plus.
610	00:38:50	00:38:53	Oh, and Johnny's getting a promotion.
611	00:39:04	00:39:06	Girl's cat...
612	00:39:06	00:39:09	positive for staphylococcus.
613	00:39:09	00:39:11	You know, I spoke with Janet Trent.
614	00:39:11	00:39:13	She and her daughters are all healthy.
615	00:39:13	00:39:16	Could their cat have been infected by Mrs. Elliot?
616	00:39:16	00:39:20	Could Rascal have been her cat at one time?
617	00:39:21	00:39:24	What, and she...
618	00:39:24	00:39:25	gave it to the girls? No.
619	00:39:25	00:39:28	So if it was hers, and she...
620	00:39:28	00:39:31	didn't give it away...
621	00:39:31	00:39:35	Maybe someone in the Trent house adopted it.
622	00:40:27	00:40:31	We know that Mrs. Elliot was killed by this pen.
623	00:40:31	00:40:35	Can one of you tell me what happened?
624	00:40:37	00:40:40	Girls, do you understand what Ms. Willows is asking you?
625	00:40:47	00:40:50	I'll tell. No. You promised.
626	00:40:50	00:40:56	Jessica, in this room, the only promise you make is to tell the truth.
627	00:40:56	00:40:57	She didn't mean to do it.
628	00:40:57	00:40:59	I'm sure she didn't.
629	00:40:59	00:41:01	Who?
630	00:41:02	00:41:04	Mommy.
631	00:41:11	00:41:14	What did your mother do?
632	00:41:14	00:41:18	Mrs. Elliot should have just given us the cat.
633	00:41:18	00:41:20	He's always at our house.
634	00:41:20	00:41:22	Rascal likes it there.
635	00:41:22	00:41:23	I won't give them away.
636	00:41:24	00:41:25	Look, then I'll pay you for him.
637	00:41:25	00:41:26	I'm sorry.
638	00:41:26	00:41:29	Every child should have a cat but these are mine.
639	00:41:29	00:41:30	Just give me... Oh!
640	00:41:30	00:41:31	Girls, take the cat and run.
641	00:41:31	00:41:33	Go. Go.
642	00:41:33	00:41:35	No! Please... no!
643	00:41:35	00:41:39	So then we ran, and that's when we heard the old lady scream.
644	00:41:41	00:41:42	Jackie?
645	00:41:45	00:41:46	Girls, do you...
646	00:41:46	00:41:48	know about fingerprints?
647	00:41:51	00:42:04	When you... touch something-- like this floaty pen, for instance-- you leave behind an invisible mark that's special, that's yours.
648	00:42:04	00:42:08	I have a way to...
649	00:42:08	00:42:11	see these invisible marks.
650	00:42:12	00:42:17	And we found these fingerprints on the pen.
651	00:42:18	00:42:21	And they don't belong to an adult.
652	00:42:28	00:42:30	They're not mine.
653	00:42:32	00:42:35	Tattletales burn in hell.
654	00:42:38	00:42:42	The old lady should have just given me the cat.
655	00:42:43	00:42:45	I lied before.
656	00:42:45	00:42:47	She wasn't nice.
657	00:42:47	00:42:50	She was mean.
658	00:42:50	00:42:53	My mom said we can keep him. Please?
659	00:42:53	00:42:56	These are my babies. I don't give them away.
660	00:42:56	00:42:57	But you have so many.
661	00:42:57	00:42:58	We don't have even one.
662	00:42:58	00:42:59	I'm sorry.
663	00:43:03	00:43:05	Run, Jackie!
664	00:43:08	00:43:10	I'll tell your mother! You won't!
665	00:43:33	00:43:35	Did you know?
666	00:43:35	00:43:41	I told the girls that they could have a cat if Mrs. Elliot gave them one.
667	00:43:41	00:43:45	I knew she never would.
668	00:43:45	00:43:47	That's why I made the promise.
669	00:43:47	00:43:50	No, I need Mommy.
670	00:43:50	00:43:53	Mommy. I want my mommy!
671	00:43:53	00:43:56	No! Jessica!
672	00:43:56	00:43:58	Mommy...
673	00:44:00	00:44:03	Mommy...
