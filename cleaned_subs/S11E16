0,00:00:02,00:00:10,REPORTER: Tonight there are still many questions looming in the wake of serial killer Nate Haskell's escape from police custody.
1,00:00:10,00:00:27,"Haskell, the convicted Dick and Jane Killer, was being transported in a prison van when an apparent coconspirator smashed her vehicle into the prison convoy, fatally shooting two corrections officers and another female accomplice,before she and Haskell then fled the scene."
2,00:00:27,00:00:32,Police continue to ask the public for any information they may have regarding the case.
3,00:00:32,00:00:36,"Don't turn it off on my account. Nothing I haven't seen, nothing I haven't heard."
4,00:00:37,00:00:39,You have any word?
5,00:00:39,00:00:40,I got nothing.
6,00:00:40,00:00:43,"Nothing? There's been sightings from here to Poughkeepsie-- nothing substantial, you know."
7,00:00:43,00:00:47,"Man like Haskell gets on the loose, people get shook, start seeing things."
8,00:00:47,00:00:50,"We got nationwide BOLOs, NCICs have been alerted."
9,00:00:50,00:00:51,That's how we catch criminals.
10,00:00:51,00:00:57,"Haskell's a different matter, Jim. Hey, Ray, there are a lot of people putting in a lot of time on this."
11,00:00:57,00:00:59,"He'll make a move, we'll get him."
12,00:00:59,00:01:03,"And until he makes a mistake, I guess we just satisfy ourselves picking up bodies, right?"
13,00:01:03,00:01:05,(crowd clamoring)
14,00:01:05,00:01:07,"MAN (echoing): Hey, buddy, you okay?"
15,00:01:07,00:01:09,WOMAN: We should call 911.
16,00:01:09,00:01:10,"(phone dials, siren approaches)"
17,00:01:14,00:01:15,EMT: Let's get some tape out. Everybody back!
18,00:01:15,00:01:19,I'm not getting any pulse. Hook him up to the EKG.
19,00:01:19,00:01:22,Not viable. Flatliner.
20,00:01:22,00:01:23,No signs of life.
21,00:01:23,00:01:25,"Affirm, a 419. Roll coroner."
22,00:01:25,00:01:27,(siren wails)
23,00:01:27,00:01:28,No apparent injuries.
24,00:01:28,00:01:30,I don't smell any booze.
25,00:01:30,00:01:33,Liver temp is 98 degrees.
26,00:01:33,00:01:35,Been dead less than an hour.
27,00:01:35,00:01:42,"Okay, let's bag him."
28,00:01:42,00:01:44,(zipping bag)
29,00:01:51,00:01:53,(camera shutter snaps)
30,00:02:12,00:02:14,(ringtone plays)
31,00:02:14,00:02:16,(sighs)
32,00:02:20,00:02:22,(sighs)
33,00:02:22,00:02:23,"I'm busy, okay?"
34,00:02:23,00:02:26,"No, no, no, I can't talk about this now."
35,00:02:26,00:02:31,"Well, I-I tried to talk about it this morning, but I'm busy now."
36,00:02:31,00:02:34,Uh-huh. I'm sorry.
37,00:02:34,00:02:37,Did you say I act like my job is life and death?
38,00:02:37,00:02:40,"Well, excuse me, my, my job is just death."
39,00:02:40,00:02:41,"Yeah, that's right."
40,00:02:41,00:02:44,"60 hours a week, plus unpaid overtime worth of death."
41,00:02:44,00:02:45,"Which reminds me, I have a customer waiting."
42,00:02:45,00:02:48,I gotta get back to work.
43,00:02:48,00:02:50,"No, I'll call you later."
44,00:03:14,00:03:17,ROBBINS: David? David?
45,00:03:17,00:03:21,"David, you're zoning out again."
46,00:03:21,00:03:24,"I-I'm back, Doc."
47,00:03:24,00:03:26,BRASS: So let me get this straight.
48,00:03:26,00:03:31,"You found a John Doe in his 20s on the pavement near the Strip, and you brought him here dead."
49,00:03:31,00:03:36,"Yeah, I-I was about to take a sample of his vitreous fluid when he, uh..."
50,00:03:36,00:03:37,"Well, he just..."
51,00:03:37,00:03:39,Decided to leave? Well...
52,00:03:39,00:03:42,"Oh, so a dead guy just got up and left? Okay."
53,00:03:42,00:03:43,How'd you end up on the ground?
54,00:03:43,00:03:46,"Well, I had to defend my domain."
55,00:03:46,00:03:49,"Well, you put a hole in his liver. I think I'd call that a draw."
56,00:03:49,00:03:53,Were you able to get a fingerprint or a blood sample or anything we can use to I.D. the man?
57,00:03:53,00:03:58,"No. No, I just had time to snap a few photos, take personal effects from his pockets."
58,00:03:58,00:03:59,There's no wallet.
59,00:03:59,00:04:02,"MAN: Captain Brass, coroner's office has been cleared."
60,00:04:02,00:04:03,No suspect found.
61,00:04:03,00:04:14,"Copy that. Put out a broadcast: ""Suspect has left the building."" Dead man walking."
62,00:04:49,00:04:52,"Sweetie, I'm okay. I'm sorry, too, honey bunny."
63,00:04:52,00:04:54,"I feel awful, Doc, but I swear the guy was dead."
64,00:04:54,00:04:55,Did you check respiration?
65,00:04:55,00:04:56,Yes! EKG?
66,00:04:56,00:04:58,"I'm telling you, it was a flatline."
67,00:04:59,00:05:02,(camera shutter snaps)
68,00:05:09,00:05:14,Sweat on the body bag where the dead man's palms would have been.
69,00:05:14,00:05:16,"Dead men don't sweat, do they, Doctor?"
70,00:05:16,00:05:18,About as often as they get up and walk away.
71,00:05:18,00:05:20,"Have a trace of blood, as well."
72,00:05:20,00:05:22,LANGSTON: That's from the liver stick puncture.
73,00:05:22,00:05:24,What'd you find in his pockets?
74,00:05:24,00:05:27,City bus pass. No particular route.
75,00:05:27,00:05:33,"This old notebook, very well used, filled with all kinds of data."
76,00:05:33,00:05:37,"""Stonewall 1/14, day seven."
77,00:05:37,00:05:39,"""Number one-- Status quo."
78,00:05:39,00:05:52,"Number two-- Moved from Falcon to Chameleon."" And then these last pages are written in a completely different hand, dated a week ago."
79,00:05:52,00:05:57,"""Making progress, feeling closer."" Hey, got some surveillance."
80,00:06:12,00:06:16,"Dead rising, birds falling from the sky, fish dying in rivers."
81,00:06:16,00:06:19,Should we be looking for the Antichrist to make an appearance?
82,00:06:19,00:06:22,Haskell being on the loose is enough to fill our quota.
83,00:06:28,00:06:30,Coffee? Yes.
84,00:06:30,00:06:32,"Thanks! No ambulance yet, huh?"
85,00:06:32,00:06:33,Nope. Early bird gets the caffeine.
86,00:06:33,00:06:36,You said you have a DB with a head wound?
87,00:06:36,00:06:41,I do. Some of the shop owners around here complain about the homeless people being too at home in these alleys.
88,00:06:41,00:06:43,So I check on 'em from time to time.
89,00:06:43,00:06:46,Just how far a walk are we talking about? Right here.
90,00:06:46,00:06:47,Are you sure?
91,00:06:47,00:06:48,"He was right here, dead!"
92,00:06:48,00:06:50,I checked his pulse myself.
93,00:06:50,00:06:53,I'm not kidding you; he was here.
94,00:06:58,00:07:03,"Well, we got a blood pool. You weren't dreaming."
95,00:07:04,00:07:06,(camera shutter clicks)
96,00:07:06,00:07:08,"Looks like he, uh, hit his head on the gutter spout?"
97,00:07:08,00:07:10,Maybe he was intoxicated.
98,00:07:10,00:07:14,"You know, heavily enough to suppress his heart rate, make him appear pulseless."
99,00:07:21,00:07:22,That's him.
100,00:07:22,00:07:26,Surveillance footage from the garage at the end of the alley where you found him...
101,00:07:26,00:07:27,and then lost him.
102,00:07:27,00:07:28,"Captain, I swear."
103,00:07:28,00:07:32,"Look, the good news for you is this isn't the first time this has happened today."
104,00:07:32,00:07:36,That's the second body that's just got up and walked away.
105,00:07:36,00:07:37,It's a zombie epidemic.
106,00:07:37,00:07:38,A zombie epidemic?
107,00:07:38,00:07:39,Is that how you're gonna characterize it?
108,00:07:39,00:07:42,Turn around and tell these guys we have a zombie epidemic in Las Vegas.
109,00:07:42,00:07:44,See how far you get.
110,00:07:44,00:07:45,Come on. (officers laughing)
111,00:07:45,00:07:48,Maybe you ought to keep that to yourself.
112,00:07:53,00:07:55,(computer trilling)
113,00:07:59,00:08:00,DMV facial recognition?
114,00:08:00,00:08:02,"Yeah. Yeah, it's worth a shot."
115,00:08:02,00:08:07,"You know, I considered calling the DMV. Half the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway."
116,00:08:07,00:08:09,Maybe they recognize this guy.
117,00:08:09,00:08:13,"Uh, I got the DNA results on the blood found in the alley and the body bag."
118,00:08:13,00:08:14,Neither John Doe was in CODIS.
119,00:08:22,00:08:23,Hmm?
120,00:08:23,00:08:29,"Yeah, ""Zombie DNA Index System."" He made me say that."
121,00:08:29,00:08:33,He also wants you to know that zombie blood is no different than regular human blood.
122,00:08:33,00:08:36,The potassium and glucose levels are consistent with the living.
123,00:08:36,00:08:37,That's all you have for us?
124,00:08:37,00:08:39,"I ran tox, too, and both samples were clean."
125,00:08:39,00:08:41,"Although, working with such minimal samples is fairly useless."
126,00:08:41,00:08:45,"You know, brain-hungry zombies could say the same thing about Hodges."
127,00:08:45,00:08:47,Minimal sample.
128,00:08:47,00:08:48,Fairly useless.
129,00:08:48,00:08:48,Exactly.
130,00:09:24,00:09:35,"SANDERS: I searched for combinations of the terms in morgue zombie's notebook, and discovered a Defense Department program called ""Stonewall"" that took place on the WLVU campus in the early '70s."
131,00:09:35,00:09:40,Psychological research. Found a schematic of the campus building that was used in the experiments.
132,00:09:40,00:09:50,"Included some rooms code-named ""Falcon"" and ""Chameleon."" Researchers were exploring a variety of fringe psych concepts such as ESP, out-of-body experience."
133,00:09:50,00:09:53,Science fiction. Not if they help us defeat the commies.
134,00:09:53,00:09:59,One of the most notable psychologists involved was a man named Dr. Eliot Davis Aden.
135,00:10:02,00:10:06,"""EDA."" This probably belonged to him."
136,00:10:06,00:10:08,He's an interesting guy.
137,00:10:08,00:10:12,"World-renowned psychoanalyst, but fell down the rabbit hole of psychedelic drugs."
138,00:10:12,00:10:17,"Was dismissed by the scientific community, but not without one big, fat scandal."
139,00:10:17,00:10:22,Rumor has it that Dr. Aden had become a bit of a Dr. Feelgood for the student body.
140,00:10:22,00:10:27,"At least until one of his students threw himself out of a fifth-story window, and the party came to an end."
141,00:10:27,00:10:30,"He was banished by the university, but charges were never pressed."
142,00:10:30,00:10:33,So the government didn't want to step on the toes of someone who knew their secrets.
143,00:10:33,00:10:39,"All right, so our morgue zombie is walking around with Dr. Aden's notebook. There's got to be a connection."
144,00:10:39,00:10:40,Is Aden still around?
145,00:10:40,00:10:42,He still receives a government pension check.
146,00:10:42,00:10:45,And I was able to track down the address where he receives it.
147,00:10:45,00:10:47,"Hello, Doctor."
148,00:11:27,00:11:30,(knocking)
149,00:11:30,00:11:33,MAN: Casino's three miles further.
150,00:11:33,00:11:34,Dr. Aden?
151,00:11:34,00:11:38,Dr. Aden... Uh... we'd like to speak with you.
152,00:11:38,00:11:39,You got the wrong guy.
153,00:11:39,00:11:42,We're from the crime lab. We found something of yours.
154,00:11:47,00:11:50,ADEN: Lying government bastards!
155,00:11:50,00:11:52,Ivory-tower turncoats!
156,00:11:52,00:11:59,"Frat boy plays window Icarus, and the university throws my reputation out the window with him."
157,00:11:59,00:12:04,They claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed.
158,00:12:04,00:12:06,Banished me from university property.
159,00:12:06,00:12:10,It was a good way to cut me out of the greenandthe glory.
160,00:12:10,00:12:13,It's Philo Farnsworth all over again!
161,00:12:13,00:12:15,I'm sorry. Where did you find this?
162,00:12:15,00:12:17,"In the pocket of, uh, this young man."
163,00:12:17,00:12:18,Do you recognize him?
164,00:12:18,00:12:22,Uh-uh... He's dead?
165,00:12:22,00:12:25,He's obviously on an autopsy table.
166,00:12:25,00:12:28,"Actually, the young man in question..."
167,00:12:29,00:12:31,...arose.
168,00:12:33,00:12:37,The Lazarus myth made real?
169,00:12:38,00:12:42,Re-animation? This is getting more interesting.
170,00:12:42,00:12:43,"It's, uh..."
171,00:12:43,00:12:46,"not as easy as you might think, bringing back the dead."
172,00:12:46,00:12:48,It's not work for neophytes.
173,00:12:48,00:12:50,Or the reckless. Or the timid.
174,00:12:50,00:12:57,"Oh, sure, they can conjure up a cardiac spasm, or a momentary flash from the bioelectric system."
175,00:12:57,00:13:02,"That's not the same as... Doctor, are you saying that you conducted re-animation experiments at Stonewall?"
176,00:13:02,00:13:04,"What's your clearance, soldier?"
177,00:13:04,00:13:06,Uh... about five-nine.
178,00:13:06,00:13:09,"Doctor, are those your notes from the re-animation experiments?"
179,00:13:09,00:13:11,It's hard to say.
180,00:13:11,00:13:13,It's my writing.
181,00:13:13,00:13:16,I won a lot of awards for penmanship in third grade.
182,00:13:16,00:13:20,"Of course, staying between the lines for me wasn't easy."
183,00:13:20,00:13:23,These... last entries.
184,00:13:23,00:13:25,It's not my handwriting.
185,00:13:25,00:13:30,Some vulture is perching on my giant shoulders.
186,00:13:30,00:13:33,Feasting on the carrion of my discoveries.
187,00:13:33,00:13:35,Treating the work as their own.
188,00:13:35,00:13:40,"In your, um, re-animation experiments, Doctor, how far would you say you were able to get?"
189,00:13:40,00:13:46,I had the Ithaca of that most profound mystery within my sights.
190,00:13:46,00:13:50,Could almost reach out and touch it.
191,00:13:50,00:13:52,But I saw the storm clouds gathering.
192,00:13:52,00:13:54,The maelstrom.
193,00:13:54,00:13:59,"For those not wise enough to pull their sails in, certain destruction awaits."
194,00:13:59,00:14:03,I'm trying to say... this isn't good.
195,00:14:11,00:14:13,"(laughing, conversing indistinctly)"
196,00:14:15,00:14:16,"San Francisco girl, huh?"
197,00:14:16,00:14:20,"Left my heart, and half my cerebral cortex in Frisco."
198,00:14:20,00:14:22,You ever see The Dead play the Fillmore?
199,00:14:22,00:14:25,"No, uh... too busy with the dead everywhere else."
200,00:14:25,00:14:26,Lucky you.
201,00:14:26,00:14:37,"LANGSTON: The research librarian said that your work was archived in a disused wing of one of the buildings, gave me the keys, but said ""enter at your own risk."" Preface fit for any worthwhile venture."
202,00:14:37,00:14:38,Where is it?
203,00:14:38,00:14:40,"Lincoln Hall, room 317."
204,00:14:40,00:14:41,Right where I left it.
205,00:14:41,00:14:43,"Lazy, lying bastards!"
206,00:14:43,00:14:45,"WILLOWS: I really don't know, Conrad."
207,00:14:45,00:14:51,Maybe we need a new classification for this type of situation. D.O.-AWOL.
208,00:14:51,00:14:52,That was a joke!
209,00:14:52,00:14:54,"Hey, Catherine. Later, Conrad."
210,00:14:54,00:14:57,I got a DMV facial recognition match on the morgue zombie.
211,00:14:57,00:14:59,"Oh, Max Ferris. Mm-hmm."
212,00:14:59,00:15:02,"Home address is on the WLVU campus, so I called the school."
213,00:15:02,00:15:04,He's a grad student in psychology.
214,00:15:04,00:15:05,Could be how he got Aden's notebook.
215,00:15:05,00:15:10,"Yeah. I'll have Brass send a uniform to his place, trap his credit cards, see if we can track him down."
216,00:15:10,00:15:11,Nice.
217,00:15:12,00:15:14,We don't need a key. The lock's been busted out.
218,00:15:14,00:15:16,"Easy. Easy, Doctor."
219,00:15:16,00:15:17,"Easy, easy, easy."
220,00:15:17,00:15:19,We don't want to tamper with this.
221,00:15:19,00:15:21,This is all evidence.
222,00:15:26,00:15:27,This...
223,00:15:27,00:15:30,is my Library of Alexandria.
224,00:15:30,00:15:32,My trove of treasures.
225,00:15:32,00:15:38,"I may have been banned bodily, but I wandered it nightly in my dreams."
226,00:15:38,00:15:41,Looks like someone's been doing some independent study here.
227,00:15:46,00:15:49,"Doctor, are these... all yourpapers?"
228,00:15:49,00:15:51,Do you know how many papers I wrote?
229,00:15:53,00:15:54,I'm asking.
230,00:15:54,00:15:56,How about we get back to you on that?
231,00:15:56,00:15:57,Hmm.
232,00:15:57,00:16:08,"""Reflections On Near-death Experiences."" ""Death As Gateway."" That was my""WhiteAlbum."" They all appear to be on the same subject."
233,00:16:08,00:16:12,"Sooner or later, all us chickens cross the road."
234,00:16:12,00:16:15,"Now, aren't we all curious about what's on the other side?"
235,00:16:15,00:16:18,"Hey, Doc."
236,00:16:18,00:16:20,Your other subjects look untouched.
237,00:16:20,00:16:26,Whoever's been playing around with your papers was only interested in your research on death-related phenomena.
238,00:16:26,00:16:30,Making your acolyte's visit to the morgue... what?
239,00:16:30,00:16:32,A field trip?
240,00:16:32,00:16:36,"In all my journeys to the other side, I never left this building."
241,00:16:36,00:16:40,"DMT, ketamine, those were the only tickets I needed."
242,00:16:40,00:16:41,Hallucinogenic trips?
243,00:16:41,00:16:43,Better than a ride in a coroner's van?
244,00:16:46,00:16:48,Where is it?
245,00:16:50,00:16:52,Where isit?
246,00:16:52,00:16:53,What have they done to my song?
247,00:16:53,00:16:55,Dr. Aden!
248,00:16:58,00:17:02,"BRASS: So, Captain Klepto, you don't look like Max Ferris."
249,00:17:02,00:17:04,Guy was passed out on the sidewalk.
250,00:17:04,00:17:05,A real eyesore.
251,00:17:05,00:17:10,"So it's your civic duty to steal his wallet, take his cash, and swipe his credit card?"
252,00:17:10,00:17:12,I had that plastic for a whole day. I only used it once.
253,00:17:12,00:17:15,"For a six-pack of beer, so..."
254,00:17:15,00:17:17,Cleaning up the streets andfiscally responsible.
255,00:17:17,00:17:18,You ought to run for office.
256,00:17:18,00:17:19,"Look out, Mayor Goodman."
257,00:17:19,00:17:22,"Hey, I gave you his wallet and his..."
258,00:17:22,00:17:26,"phone...thing. What are the odds you'll just cut me loose, huh?"
259,00:17:26,00:17:28,This is a phone?
260,00:17:28,00:17:30,"Didn't look like any phone I'd seen, either."
261,00:17:30,00:17:32,But I'm a couple iPhones behind.
262,00:17:32,00:17:33,"Yeah, I'll bet you are."
263,00:17:33,00:17:34,JOHNSON: It's not a phone.
264,00:17:34,00:17:37,It's a wearable camcorder.
265,00:17:37,00:17:40,Wireless video camera and receiver.
266,00:17:40,00:17:41,Our morgue zombie was using it.
267,00:17:41,00:17:45,"Well, grab some popcorn."
268,00:17:46,00:17:49,"Tonight, we take the ultimate step."
269,00:17:49,00:17:52,Beyond our past journeys of the mind.
270,00:17:52,00:17:56,"Tonight, we free ourselves from the physical plane."
271,00:17:56,00:18:00,"Unspooling the mortal coil, we seek the mystery that lies beyond..."
272,00:18:00,00:18:04,"Hey, Discovery Channel, kill the speech and let's kill some brain cells."
273,00:18:04,00:18:07,This guy on the left-- his clothing matches the description of our alley zombie.
274,00:18:07,00:18:10,It's a dead man's party.
275,00:18:10,00:18:11,Except the third person looks like a woman.
276,00:18:11,00:18:13,DR. ADEN: How could they do this?
277,00:18:13,00:18:14,What have they done?
278,00:18:14,00:18:17,If they've given it to some health club...
279,00:18:17,00:18:19,"Dr. Aden, slow down."
280,00:18:19,00:18:21,Dude. You going to tell us what we're taking?
281,00:18:21,00:18:24,FERRIS: No need to add baggage to your trip.
282,00:18:24,00:18:25,"Trust me, Kurt."
283,00:18:25,00:18:26,It's going to be an adventure.
284,00:18:26,00:18:30,It's time to put your cameras on.
285,00:18:30,00:18:32,See you on re-entry.
286,00:18:35,00:18:36,"Godspeed, Alice."
287,00:18:38,00:18:42,WILLOWS: Max's friends Kurt and Alice.
288,00:18:42,00:18:46,Maybe we can get access to Max's university email account; check his contacts.
289,00:18:46,00:18:47,See who his co-pilots were.
290,00:18:47,00:18:49,Yeah.
291,00:18:59,00:19:02,Angelfish. Triggerfish.
292,00:19:02,00:19:05,Blue-ringed octopus.
293,00:19:05,00:19:07,All poisonous.
294,00:19:07,00:19:08,All alive.
295,00:19:08,00:19:12,Someone has been in here on a regular basis.
296,00:19:12,00:19:14,FERRIS: 20 minutes after ingestion.
297,00:19:14,00:19:17,Effects are manifesting.
298,00:19:17,00:19:20,(sighs)
299,00:19:20,00:19:26,So Max has made his way to the Strip. He's at the plaza by the Tangiers.
300,00:19:26,00:19:29,Increasing numbness of the mouth.
301,00:19:29,00:19:33,S... Speech is becoming difficult.
302,00:19:33,00:19:37,Numbness spreading.
303,00:19:38,00:19:41,That hum.
304,00:19:41,00:19:44,The fish tank filter.
305,00:19:44,00:19:46,"No, no, it's another harmonic."
306,00:20:00,00:20:03,She's here!
307,00:20:03,00:20:04,"Oh, my..."
308,00:20:04,00:20:07,"Santa Maria,myNautilus!"
309,00:20:07,00:20:11,The vessel of all my dreams.
310,00:20:11,00:20:15,Dr. Aden!
311,00:20:15,00:20:17,SARA: That's not Max Ferris.
312,00:20:17,00:20:18,That's our alley zombie.
313,00:20:18,00:20:20,De-animated.
314,00:20:29,00:20:33,The good doctor is content to wait in the hall. He hasn't had this much excitement since Altamont.
315,00:20:33,00:20:34,Or so he says.
316,00:20:34,00:20:36,Police and coroners are on their way.
317,00:20:36,00:20:38,Pulled the victim's wallet. Kurt Dawson.
318,00:20:38,00:20:43,"Lived near campus, but his student ID expired about a year ago."
319,00:20:43,00:20:44,Dropped out of school.
320,00:20:44,00:20:46,Or dropped out of reality.
321,00:20:46,00:20:47,A sensory deprivation tank.
322,00:20:49,00:20:52,Did you ever see that movie Altered States?
323,00:20:52,00:20:53,Oh. Yeah. My mom took me.
324,00:20:53,00:20:56,"She found it therapeutic, calming."
325,00:20:56,00:20:57,Says it all.
326,00:20:57,00:21:00,"I saw it with some really good buds. Go, Dr. Ray."
327,00:21:00,00:21:02,I know. I only talk like a square.
328,00:21:02,00:21:10,Tank water's highly salinated; kept at body temp so the user floats in complete silence and darkness.
329,00:21:10,00:21:12,Blocking out all earthly stimuli.
330,00:21:14,00:21:19,"You know, in the movie Altered States, William Hurt went into the tank naked."
331,00:21:19,00:21:26,"To strip the self down to one's primitive, disembodied being is how you free the mind, allowing it to venture into other realms."
332,00:21:26,00:21:29,You wouldn't want to go venturing in ten pounds of wet clothes and sneakers.
333,00:21:30,00:21:33,Maybe the tank wasn't his idea.
334,00:21:33,00:21:37,ROBBINS: I noticed some faint bruising that started to develop on Kurt's back and shoulder.
335,00:21:37,00:21:40,"So, I snapped some infrared photos."
336,00:21:40,00:21:42,Hand marks. He was held down.
337,00:21:42,00:21:44,That's one way to drown in just ten inches of water.
338,00:21:44,00:21:46,So drowning is COD?
339,00:21:46,00:21:51,"Heavy, edematous lungs, and fluid in his sphenoid sinus make it pretty clear."
340,00:21:51,00:21:53,I thought maybe you'd start chaining them down.
341,00:21:53,00:21:57,Although yanking out vital organs is a good way to keep the clients.
342,00:21:57,00:21:59,Henry.
343,00:21:59,00:22:03,"Right. Um, found trace of Tetrodotoxin-- TTX-- in his system."
344,00:22:03,00:22:08,"It's a naturally occurring poison, 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide."
345,00:22:08,00:22:11,It's present in a variety of sea creatures.
346,00:22:11,00:22:16,"The toxin blocks sodium channels, blacking out the body's nervous system."
347,00:22:16,00:22:22,"A dose the size of a pinhead can kill, and short of killing, it can completely paralyze a person for hours."
348,00:22:22,00:22:32,"Considering his condition in that alley, I checked out the half-life table for TTX, and the current level of toxin in him would be consistent with a dose of two milligrams 16 hours ago."
349,00:22:32,00:22:37,"Enough to paralyze, suppress heartbeat and breathing, and get him mistaken for dead."
350,00:22:37,00:22:42,There was a fish tank with some poisonous specimens in the same room we found him in.
351,00:22:42,00:22:44,Could the toxins have been extracted from them? Sure.
352,00:22:44,00:22:46,With some sophisticated biochem resources.
353,00:22:46,00:22:52,Although there were two other substances present in his system-- LSD and cannabis.
354,00:22:52,00:22:56,"Body was frozen, mind was ablaze."
355,00:22:56,00:22:58,I've been there.
356,00:22:58,00:23:00,PHILLIPS: This one's actually dead.
357,00:23:00,00:23:02,Congratulations. You're batting .500.
358,00:23:02,00:23:05,"Yeah, great for a hitter, bad for pronouncing death."
359,00:23:06,00:23:08,Let me see your EKG.
360,00:23:11,00:23:13,"What are you looking for, Doc?"
361,00:23:13,00:23:23,"Your zombie from the Strip was under the influence of a paralytic, which we would have known if you'd had the gain on this unit correctly calibrated, which it's not."
362,00:23:23,00:23:25,"The way you've got it set, it wouldn't pick up my heartbeat."
363,00:23:25,00:23:27,I'd be a flat-liner.
364,00:23:27,00:23:29,You're lucky you're not benched.
365,00:23:29,00:23:35,"Misdiagnose the undead again, put my assistant in harm's way, and you'll find yourself unemployed."
366,00:23:43,00:23:47,Footprints in salt water leading towards the door.
367,00:23:47,00:23:51,"The vic was wearing sneakers, size eights."
368,00:23:51,00:23:55,"Yeah, well, these feet are at least size 11 or 12."
369,00:23:55,00:23:57,Maybe his pal Max came back here first.
370,00:24:04,00:24:06,I've got some light blue fibers here.
371,00:24:06,00:24:10,Same as the T-shirt Max Ferris was wearing in the morgue.
372,00:24:10,00:24:11,So...
373,00:24:11,00:24:19,"Max makes a break from the coroner's office, comes here, dumps his clothes, gets in the tank to decompress."
374,00:24:19,00:24:20,SIDLE: And Kurt Dawson shows up.
375,00:24:20,00:24:23,They get into some sort of drug-induced fight.
376,00:24:25,00:24:27,(muffled groaning)
377,00:24:28,00:24:32,STOKES: Max wins and walks out of here.
378,00:24:43,00:24:44,"Hey, Sara."
379,00:24:44,00:24:45,Hmm?
380,00:24:45,00:24:48,Looks like Kurt lost his camera in the fight.
381,00:24:48,00:24:55,"LSD and Tetrodotoxin-- ""voodoo powder""-- curious combination."
382,00:24:55,00:24:59,To paralyze yourself in order to free yourself...
383,00:24:59,00:25:04,"Well, what kind of state of mind would that produce in an individual-- this cocktail?"
384,00:25:04,00:25:07,There's an entire spectrum of possibilities.
385,00:25:07,00:25:11,"Blazing, manic lucidity, to oppressive darkness."
386,00:25:11,00:25:16,Designer drugs-- one size does not fit all.
387,00:25:16,00:25:21,"Could this cocktail produce, in certain individuals, uncontrollable rage, say?"
388,00:25:21,00:25:23,Why do you ask?
389,00:25:23,00:25:25,"Well, one of our young explorers killed the other."
390,00:25:25,00:25:31,"Well, I would have to know more about the particulars of the situation."
391,00:25:31,00:25:35,"There's no fighting in the war room, Dr. Strangelove."
392,00:25:35,00:25:38,I want you to look at something.
393,00:25:38,00:25:40,FERRIS: ...beyond our past journeys of the mind.
394,00:25:40,00:25:43,"Tonight, we free ourselves from the physical plane."
395,00:25:43,00:25:48,"Unspooling the mortal coil, we seek the mystery that lies beyond."
396,00:25:48,00:25:52,"Hey, Discovery Channel, kill the speech and let's kill some brain cells."
397,00:25:52,00:25:55,"Dude, are you going to tell us what we're taking?"
398,00:25:55,00:25:58,No need to add baggage to your trip.
399,00:25:58,00:25:59,Flag on the play.
400,00:25:59,00:26:02,This young Columbus didn't prepare his crew.
401,00:26:02,00:26:05,He knew what the toxins would induce.
402,00:26:05,00:26:12,"There's a vast difference between leading others into the beyond, and throwing them into it unwittingly."
403,00:26:12,00:26:17,"To some, that's sinister science, and could inspire rage and fury."
404,00:26:17,00:26:23,"So, Kurt, not knowing what he was taking, survives the paralyzing nightmare."
405,00:26:23,00:26:26,Comes back to confront Max.
406,00:26:26,00:26:29,They fight. Max kills Kurt.
407,00:26:29,00:26:35,Yes. The reckless master kills the wronged squire.
408,00:26:35,00:26:37,Sounds like a role you're not unfamiliar with.
409,00:26:37,00:26:41,"Max was modeling himself after you, Dr. Aden."
410,00:26:41,00:26:42,You and your work.
411,00:26:42,00:26:48,"And here, you see, he sent his friends Alice and Kurt, unwittingly as you said, into the fire."
412,00:26:48,00:26:54,Probably felt like it was a... a worthy sacrifice.
413,00:26:54,00:26:57,Knowledge demands its payment.
414,00:26:57,00:27:01,"It's always nice when somebody picks up the bill for you, though."
415,00:27:04,00:27:07,Went through Kurt Dawson's e-mail accounts.
416,00:27:07,00:27:13,"Found a number of messages exchanged between him, Max Ferris and another WLVU student, Alice Katsu."
417,00:27:13,00:27:14,Alice from the video.
418,00:27:14,00:27:16,Yeah. Biochem major.
419,00:27:16,00:27:19,"And like Kurt, she seemed to be under Max's spell."
420,00:27:19,00:27:26,"Agreeing to his every experimental whim, late night meetings in the abandoned lab, rambling discussions on the afterlife."
421,00:27:26,00:27:28,"Well, we know what happened to Max's other friend."
422,00:27:28,00:27:29,We need to find Alice.
423,00:27:29,00:27:31,Do you have any earthly contact info on her?
424,00:27:31,00:27:35,"So, Mr. Katsu, when was the last time you saw your sister?"
425,00:27:35,00:27:36,Three days ago.
426,00:27:36,00:27:37,It's just Alice and me here.
427,00:27:37,00:27:42,When she's at school and I'm at work sometimes we go a couple of days without even bumping into each other.
428,00:27:42,00:27:44,"Even when she's here, she's quiet."
429,00:27:44,00:27:47,"Sometimes, it feels like having a ghost in the house."
430,00:27:55,00:27:57,Mom liked jelly beans.
431,00:27:57,00:28:00,It's a Shinto shrine-- offering for the dead.
432,00:28:00,00:28:03,Alice even plucked out the black ones.
433,00:28:09,00:28:18,"WILLOWS: She's got some academic honors awards from the past few semesters, but an academic probation letter from just a month ago."
434,00:28:18,00:28:22,SIDLE: A card from her mom's funeral five months ago.
435,00:28:22,00:28:23,Doesn't take a detective.
436,00:28:23,00:28:25,Mom's death took a toll.
437,00:28:28,00:28:30,"Ooh, another one of Dr. Aden's notebooks."
438,00:28:37,00:28:42,"""Question of crossing over physically versus mentally."
439,00:28:42,00:28:50,"Are they inextricably linked?"" She took a picture of Mom's grave every day."
440,00:28:50,00:28:52,Capturing the change in light and seasons.
441,00:28:52,00:28:55,Trying to shape something living out of the dead.
442,00:28:56,00:29:04,"I think, while Max Ferris dosed himself to explore the mysteries of the afterlife, and Kurt was out for a good time, Alice..."
443,00:29:04,00:29:06,Was traveling in search of someone.
444,00:29:06,00:29:10,Maybe we'll find Alice if we look in the same direction she was looking.
445,00:29:17,00:29:20,Groundskeeper said it was right around here somewhere.
446,00:29:24,00:29:26,"I don't think they're going anywhere, Mitch."
447,00:29:26,00:29:28,"Yeah, right."
448,00:29:31,00:29:34,Hey.
449,00:29:35,00:29:38,Alice?
450,00:29:45,00:29:46,Max?
451,00:29:50,00:29:51,Max.
452,00:29:55,00:29:57,Whoa!
453,00:29:57,00:29:59,Down. On your knees.
454,00:30:02,00:30:04,I thought she'd be here.
455,00:30:04,00:30:05,"Max, you're crashing from a bad trip."
456,00:30:05,00:30:07,We need to get you to a hospital.
457,00:30:08,00:30:10,"Stop, Max!"
458,00:30:10,00:30:11,Stop!
459,00:30:16,00:30:19,Stop! Max!
460,00:30:22,00:30:23,(tires screech)
461,00:30:26,00:30:28,"DRIVER: Oh, my God!"
462,00:30:33,00:30:35,MITCHELL: No pulse.
463,00:30:35,00:30:37,"I'm cuffing him anyway. WILLOWS: Stand back, sir."
464,00:30:37,00:30:40,Dr. Aden said this was going to end badly.
465,00:30:40,00:30:42,We have two dead.
466,00:30:42,00:30:44,Let's hope there's still time for Alice.
467,00:31:57,00:32:05,"The notebook I found in Alice Katsu's room is a match to Dr. Aden's handwriting, but the ink looked fresh, so I tested it."
468,00:32:05,00:32:10,It is a date-tag match to a formula that's only been around a couple of years.
469,00:32:10,00:32:13,Which means Dr. Aden wrote those notes recently.
470,00:32:13,00:32:16,Right. The notebook was not among his archived papers.
471,00:32:16,00:32:18,So how did Alice get it?
472,00:32:18,00:32:19,From the doctor himself.
473,00:32:19,00:32:22,He and Alice were e-mail buddies.
474,00:32:22,00:32:23,She initiated contact five months ago.
475,00:32:23,00:32:26,When her mother died. Hmm.
476,00:32:26,00:32:28,But Aden is not exactly advertising on bus benches.
477,00:32:28,00:32:31,Alice saw an anonymous commenter on a Web site about the doctor's past work.
478,00:32:31,00:32:35,She kind of felt like Mr. Anonymous knew a little bit too much.
479,00:32:35,00:32:41,"So she e-mails, ""Dear sir, ""I'm convinced by your brilliant insights ""that you are Dr. Aden himself."
480,00:32:41,00:32:46,"""I'm a great admirer of your courageous research ""into the afterlife."
481,00:32:46,00:32:53,"I want to follow in your footsteps."" He was quick to respond, ""Glad to have an acolyte,"" and encouraged her to find more of them."
482,00:32:53,00:32:56,Max and Kurt.
483,00:32:56,00:32:59,"And we thought Max was driving the bus, but it was Alice."
484,00:32:59,00:33:01,"(knocking) JOHNSON: Hey, you guys."
485,00:33:01,00:33:04,I got something for you to see.
486,00:33:04,00:33:10,I was scanning through through Kurt Dawson's video and I noticed something strange.
487,00:33:11,00:33:15,"So, here, Kurt's just wandering campus."
488,00:33:15,00:33:17,Then this happens.
489,00:33:19,00:33:21,Some kind of interference.
490,00:33:21,00:33:23,"Yeah, Kurt's receiver picked up a signal from another camera."
491,00:33:23,00:33:29,"I'm working on isolating the competing image, but in the meantime, I managed to pull a few frames."
492,00:33:29,00:33:30,"WILLOWS: Well, those are women's shoes."
493,00:33:30,00:33:32,Are we looking through Alice's camera?
494,00:33:32,00:33:37,"She must have been in close proximity to Kurt, if his receiver picked up her feet."
495,00:33:37,00:33:38,"Where is she, and what's she doing?"
496,00:33:38,00:33:41,It's hard to say. But check this out.
497,00:33:43,00:33:45,"What, a car stopped for her?"
498,00:33:45,00:33:47,STOKES: It looks like an old Saab.
499,00:33:47,00:33:52,"Hey, didn't Sara mention something about Dr. Aden driving an old dinosaur like that?"
500,00:34:07,00:34:09,His car's gone.
501,00:34:09,00:34:13,"Well, he's smart enough to lead us along, maybe he knew we were coming."
502,00:34:22,00:34:23,Dr. Aden!
503,00:34:33,00:34:34,Dr. Aden?!
504,00:34:34,00:34:36,Hello?!
505,00:34:42,00:34:44,Hello?!
506,00:34:49,00:34:53,"""Alice-- DMT-- Feb 10, 2011."
507,00:34:53,00:34:59,"Alice-- Ketamine-- Jan 18, 2011."" They had a regular thing going."
508,00:35:03,00:35:05,This one's from yesterday.
509,00:35:07,00:35:10,"ADEN: Can you blink, Alice?"
510,00:35:10,00:35:12,Come back.
511,00:35:12,00:35:15,Come back! Focus!
512,00:35:15,00:35:17,Tell me everything you've seen.
513,00:35:17,00:35:19,I need to know what you're seeing.
514,00:35:19,00:35:21,"Let me in, Alice."
515,00:35:21,00:35:22,Let me in.
516,00:35:22,00:35:24,I'm not just your hookah-smoking caterpillar.
517,00:35:24,00:35:28,Tell me everything you've seen!
518,00:35:28,00:35:30,I need to know!
519,00:35:30,00:35:32,"50 milligrams Tetrodotoxin, just a mouse click away."
520,00:35:32,00:35:35,Dr. Aden supplied the paralytic.
521,00:35:35,00:35:37,Alice just passed it around.
522,00:35:37,00:35:38,Mm-hmm.
523,00:35:38,00:35:40,"I know you've arrived there, Alice."
524,00:35:40,00:35:41,Don't leave me behind!
525,00:35:41,00:35:44,Alice?!
526,00:35:46,00:35:47,The video camera.
527,00:35:55,00:35:56,This one's from today.
528,00:36:03,00:36:07,I've come to a crossroads.
529,00:36:09,00:36:11,The false path ends here.
530,00:36:11,00:36:14,I've flirted with the precipice for too long...
531,00:36:14,00:36:20,"dispatching canaries into the celestial coal mine, but shying from the descent myself."
532,00:36:20,00:36:22,No longer.
533,00:36:22,00:36:29,"I now slip not just the bonds of mind, but of body and spirit."
534,00:36:29,00:36:31,I'm ready to set sail...
535,00:36:31,00:36:33,unafraid.
536,00:36:36,00:36:40,Ithaca... I come.
537,00:36:52,00:36:53,You hear that?
538,00:36:53,00:36:55,Yeah.
539,00:36:56,00:36:59,(didgeridoo music playing)
540,00:36:59,00:37:00,Dr. Aden!
541,00:37:04,00:37:06,Doctor?
542,00:37:15,00:37:17,A faint pupil response.
543,00:37:17,00:37:20,He ingested the toxin around noon.
544,00:37:20,00:37:28,"At his age, depriving his brain of oxygen for that period of time, he's in there, but I doubt he'll ever find his way back out."
545,00:37:28,00:37:31,What rabbit hole has Alice fallen down?
546,00:37:41,00:37:44,"WILLOWS (over radio): Nick, are you at the campus?"
547,00:37:44,00:37:46,Aden's car's parked out front.
548,00:37:46,00:37:48,Campus police called it in.
549,00:37:48,00:37:51,"I'm, uh, checking the building."
550,00:37:51,00:37:53,Copy.
551,00:38:28,00:38:29,(clatter)
552,00:39:02,00:39:04,(clattering)
553,00:39:16,00:39:18,Alice?
554,00:39:34,00:39:36,We've been looking for you.
555,00:39:36,00:39:39,"I was looking for someone, too."
556,00:39:39,00:39:40,Your mother?
557,00:39:40,00:39:43,(sobbing)
558,00:39:43,00:39:45,I found her!
559,00:39:52,00:39:56,I saw she was happy.
560,00:39:56,00:39:59,(echoing): She told me she loved me.
561,00:40:00,00:40:03,(sniffling)
562,00:40:03,00:40:05,Told me to go back.
563,00:40:15,00:40:16,Alice...
564,00:40:16,00:40:19,(sobbing)
565,00:40:19,00:40:22,"Where, where, where are Kurt and Max?"
566,00:40:22,00:40:25,I have to tell them it was everything I thought I imagined.
567,00:40:25,00:40:28,"I need to know if they found it, too."
568,00:40:28,00:40:32,"They're not coming back, Alice."
569,00:40:34,00:40:36,(sobs)
570,00:40:40,00:40:44,"Hallucinogens, neurotoxins and sensory deprivation."
571,00:40:44,00:40:50,These kids weren'treally venturing to the other side.
572,00:40:50,00:40:53,You think they were just inducing chemical dreams?
573,00:40:53,00:40:56,All their visions could be explained by neuroscience.
574,00:40:56,00:40:57,Yeah. Don't get me wrong.
575,00:40:57,00:41:04,"I'm sure Adam and Eve, when they stood over the first dead body, meditated on where his soul went."
576,00:41:04,00:41:07,Humans have always pondered whether there's an afterlife.
577,00:41:07,00:41:11,"Yeah, if the dead could talk, we'd all have our answers, but no one's talking."
578,00:41:11,00:41:12,They haven't so far.
579,00:41:12,00:41:17,Which leads me to believe that part of life that is death is meant to be a mystery.
580,00:41:17,00:41:19,"You don't sound very scientific, Doc."
581,00:41:19,00:41:23,"I see people on the last, worst day of their lives."
582,00:41:23,00:41:26,And I'd like to believe they go to a better place.
583,00:41:26,00:41:28,I'd like to think I know you a little better than that.
584,00:41:28,00:41:33,"Well, I was taught that in Sunday school long before medical school."
585,00:41:33,00:41:37,You know what I believe?
586,00:41:37,00:41:48,"I believe that people that bring suffering and pain into this world should have it repaid to them tenfold, either in this world or the next one."
587,00:41:48,00:41:50,Careful.
588,00:41:50,00:41:56,Evil has a way of making friends with the good and dragging them into the darkness.
