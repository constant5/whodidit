0	00:00:07	00:00:08	Come on. Come on.
1	00:00:08	00:00:10	Let's go. Come on. Don't fail me.
2	00:00:10	00:00:12	Come on, baby. I'm feeling this one.
3	00:00:12	00:00:13	Don't fail me. Don't you let me down.
4	00:00:13	00:00:16	Alright. Black 22.
5	00:00:16	00:00:18	If this happens, I'm buying you a shot.
6	00:00:18	00:00:20	No more bets.
7	00:00:26	00:00:28	Yes! ( screams )
8	00:00:34	00:00:35	Yeah.
9	00:00:35	00:00:37	Give me my money.
10	00:00:40	00:00:41	Let's cash out.
11	00:00:41	00:00:45	Why? I, uh, I thought we were going to take some risks tonight. Come on...
12	00:00:45	00:00:46	I want to go dancing.
13	00:00:46	00:00:47	Really? Mm-hmm.
14	00:00:47	00:00:50	Okay. As long as it's lap dancing.
15	00:00:50	00:00:52	What has gotten into you?
16	00:00:58	00:01:00	Hey, buddy, when you get a chance, can I get a couple more of these martinis?
17	00:01:00	00:01:02	One with an olive, one with a twist.
18	00:01:02	00:01:04	Thank you.
19	00:01:04	00:01:07	Why don't we, um...
20	00:01:07	00:01:08	take those up to the room?
21	00:01:12	00:01:13	'Cause I'm feeling a little...
22	00:01:13	00:01:16	frisky.
23	00:01:23	00:01:25	Do you know them?
24	00:01:25	00:01:30	No, but how frisky do you feel?
25	00:01:30	00:01:33	Hmm?
26	00:01:40	00:01:42	I'll try anything once.
27	00:01:42	00:01:44	Oh, really?
28	00:02:10	00:02:12	Housekeeping coming in.
29	00:03:01	00:03:06	Her throat's been slit by what appears to have been a very sharp implement.
30	00:03:08	00:03:11	The room is completely stripped.
31	00:03:11	00:03:12	No bedding, no sheets.
32	00:03:12	00:03:15	No towels, either.
33	00:03:15	00:03:17	Someone took a few souvenirs.
34	00:03:17	00:03:19	I'll check the surveillance tapes.
35	00:03:30	00:03:31	Alice Dominguez.
36	00:03:31	00:03:34	She wasn't robbed.
37	00:03:34	00:03:35	It's not her room, either.
38	00:03:35	00:03:38	It was registered under the name of Parker.
39	00:03:39	00:03:40	Wedding ring.
40	00:03:40	00:03:42	Where's the husband?
41	00:03:48	00:03:50	I think your cell phone's vibrating.
42	00:03:50	00:03:51	You heard that?
43	00:03:51	00:03:52	Mm-hmm.
44	00:03:54	00:03:57	You're back.
45	00:04:38	00:04:41	There's only two reasons why people get murdered in a casino.
46	00:04:41	00:04:42	Sex or money.
47	00:04:42	00:04:48	Well, on the money side, the room was booked yesterday, under a stolen credit card belonging to a Mrs. Parker.
48	00:04:48	00:04:51	She's a 75-year-old living alone in Henderson.
49	00:04:51	00:04:54	As far as sex goes, well, I want to be a believer.
50	00:04:55	00:04:56	Room closest to the exit.
51	00:04:56	00:04:58	Imagine that.
52	00:04:58	00:05:02	Quick escape. Murder central.
53	00:05:02	00:05:03	Security cameras?
54	00:05:03	00:05:04	Uh, not in the hallway.
55	00:05:04	00:05:06	Only in the elevator. We're on it.
56	00:05:06	00:05:08	Take the exit.
57	00:05:08	00:05:09	I'll take the money trail.
58	00:05:11	00:05:14	And I'll, uh... go door-to-door.
59	00:05:18	00:05:20	This is very weird.
60	00:05:22	00:05:26	Yeah, usually when someone gets their throat cut, it's from behind.
61	00:05:26	00:05:28	Yeah, and it starts there, ends there.
62	00:05:28	00:05:29	It's not very deep.
63	00:05:32	00:05:33	No ligature marks.
64	00:05:33	00:05:35	No defensive wounds.
65	00:05:36	00:05:39	I think whoever did this was sitting in that chair.
66	00:05:47	00:05:51	She sat there and allowed someone to slit her throat?
67	00:05:53	00:05:55	Hey, girl.
68	00:05:55	00:05:57	Hi.
69	00:05:57	00:05:58	What you got?
70	00:05:58	00:05:59	Not much.
71	00:05:59	00:06:01	Mrs. Dominguez checked in with her husband yesterday.
72	00:06:01	00:06:02	Room 869.
73	00:06:02	00:06:06	869? That's, like, two floors away from where she was found dead.
74	00:06:06	00:06:08	Anybody heard from the husband yet?
75	00:06:08	00:06:10	He's MIA, but he left a gambling paper trail.
76	00:06:10	00:06:11	Really?
77	00:06:11	00:06:16	I have a signature and a thumbprint from where Mr. Dominguez signed a $5,000 cash-advance check.
78	00:06:16	00:06:17	Cash advance, huh?
79	00:06:17	00:06:19	It was cash advance on a credit card.
80	00:06:19	00:06:20	It's not cheap.
81	00:06:20	00:06:21	It's, like $90 every thousand.
82	00:06:22	00:06:22	That's a rip-off.
83	00:06:23	00:06:23	Not if you're desperate.
84	00:06:23	00:06:24	He must have had a bad night.
85	00:06:25	00:06:26	Yeah, and Mrs. Dominguez had a worse night.
86	00:06:26	00:06:28	You know, nobody's checked their suite yet.
87	00:06:28	00:06:30	Would you care to join me?
88	00:06:30	00:06:31	Let's do it.
89	00:06:31	00:06:33	I heard some voices raised and a door slamming.
90	00:06:33	00:06:34	Mm. How many voices?
91	00:06:34	00:06:35	Two.
92	00:06:35	00:06:38	No, wait. Uh, maybe it was three.
93	00:06:38	00:06:40	Definitely a man and a woman.
94	00:06:40	00:06:41	What were they saying?
95	00:06:41	00:06:42	Uh, it was hard to tell.
96	00:06:42	00:06:45	You know, the walls in these joints are pretty thick.
97	00:06:45	00:06:47	They were definitely arguing about something.
98	00:06:47	00:06:48	Did you get a look at them?
99	00:06:48	00:06:50	Uh, just through the spy hole.
100	00:06:50	00:06:51	Obviously he's insane. They're both crazy.
101	00:06:51	00:06:53	Why would you put me in that situation?
102	00:06:53	00:06:54	I didn't put you in that position with...
103	00:06:55	00:06:56	What time was that?
104	00:06:56	00:06:57	35.
105	00:06:57	00:06:58	35?
106	00:06:58	00:07:00	You seem to be pretty sure about that.
107	00:07:00	00:07:04	Well, I-I had just ordered a pay-per-view movie, and it was just about to begin.
108	00:07:04	00:07:06	Oh, yeah? Which one was that?
109	00:07:06	00:07:08	Arma-get-it-on.
110	00:07:08	00:07:10	You mean, Armageddon?
111	00:07:10	00:07:12	No. Arma-get-it-on.
112	00:07:12	00:07:14	Oh.
113	00:07:16	00:07:18	Good movie?
114	00:07:18	00:07:20	Worked for me.
115	00:08:05	00:08:06	Hey, guys.
116	00:08:06	00:08:07	How you doing?
117	00:08:07	00:08:09	Uh, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and I'm...
118	00:08:09	00:08:10	Nick Stokes?
119	00:08:10	00:08:11	Yeah.
120	00:08:11	00:08:12	What's up?
121	00:08:13	00:08:14	It's Kenny!
122	00:08:14	00:08:16	Kenny Richmond.
123	00:08:16	00:08:18	Rebel baseball.
124	00:08:18	00:08:19	I played backup catcher.
125	00:08:19	00:08:20	Kenny. Yeah!
126	00:08:20	00:08:21	Hi, Kenny! Yeah!
127	00:08:22	00:08:22	How you doing, man? How you doing?
128	00:08:23	00:08:24	Good to see you.
129	00:08:24	00:08:25	Good to see you! Look at you, man.
130	00:08:25	00:08:26	Yeah. Yeah.
131	00:08:26	00:08:28	What are you doing here? You a cop now?
132	00:08:28	00:08:29	Uh, Crime Scene Investigator.
133	00:08:30	00:08:30	I'm on a case.
134	00:08:30	00:08:34	Crime Scene? Rock on, man.
135	00:08:34	00:08:35	You're here on the tenth floor thing, right?
136	00:08:35	00:08:36	Right.
137	00:08:36	00:08:39	Yeah. I heard about that, man.
138	00:08:39	00:08:41	Everybody's talking about it.
139	00:08:41	00:08:44	Somebody, uh, bashed some chick's brains in, I think, right?
140	00:08:44	00:08:48	Yeah, actually, uh, she had her throat slit and bled out all over the room.
141	00:08:48	00:08:51	I'll know more when I check the surveillance camera.
142	00:08:51	00:08:52	Well, what are you doing down here?
143	00:08:52	00:08:55	Uh, I'm just checking possible escape routes.
144	00:08:55	00:08:58	She was murdered in the room closest to the exit.
145	00:08:58	00:08:59	Murder central.
146	00:08:59	00:09:02	Murder central, huh?
147	00:09:04	00:09:05	Cool.
148	00:09:05	00:09:08	Cut began at the right carotid.
149	00:09:08	00:09:11	Severed the artery and the jugular vein and terminated at the trachea.
150	00:09:11	00:09:15	It's not as deep as I would expect for this kind of crime.
151	00:09:15	00:09:16	He sliced her gently?
152	00:09:16	00:09:17	Well, yeah.
153	00:09:17	00:09:19	Oftentimes, the only thing intact is the spinal column.
154	00:09:19	00:09:21	This did the job and nothing more.
155	00:09:22	00:09:23	And what did the tox report give us?
156	00:09:23	00:09:25	Alcohol count was .20.
157	00:09:25	00:09:26	Double the legal limit.
158	00:09:26	00:09:28	There was no limit to this woman.
159	00:09:28	00:09:30	Blood work showed heavy traces of MDMA.
160	00:09:31	00:09:33	Ecstasy? And alcohol?
161	00:09:33	00:09:34	Party mix.
162	00:09:34	00:09:37	Yeah, it might have made her docile.
163	00:09:37	00:09:40	Well, maybe it explains why she was cut from the front.
164	00:09:40	00:09:41	That may explain her head.
165	00:09:41	00:09:44	Now let's move down to the toes.
166	00:09:54	00:09:55	Glitter?
167	00:09:55	00:09:58	Yeah.
168	00:09:58	00:10:05	There is a... a strip club, um, named Shimmer on Industrial.
169	00:10:05	00:10:09	I, uh, recognized the S almost immediately.
170	00:10:10	00:10:12	You go, Doc.
171	00:10:15	00:10:17	Hello?
172	00:10:17	00:10:19	Mr. Dominguez?
173	00:10:27	00:10:30	Looks like the bed wasn't slept in.
174	00:10:30	00:10:31	Yeah.
175	00:10:44	00:10:46	Stopped for gas in Barstow.
176	00:10:46	00:10:47	Big tank. $43.
177	00:10:47	00:10:48	Clothes are still here.
178	00:10:48	00:10:50	Ford Explorer.
179	00:10:50	00:10:51	California plates.
180	00:10:51	00:10:54	Two-Paul-Charlie-Edward-329.
181	00:10:54	00:10:55	Really?
182	00:11:34	00:11:35	Hey, Warrick.
183	00:11:35	00:11:37	Take a look at this wound.
184	00:11:37	00:11:39	It's different than the wife's.
185	00:11:39	00:11:41	She was cut from the front.
186	00:11:41	00:11:44	Yeah, this one looks like he was cut from the back.
187	00:12:04	00:12:06	Hey, guys?
188	00:12:06	00:12:07	I got a knife.
189	00:12:19	00:12:21	Use this, uh...
190	00:12:21	00:12:24	cash-advance check Warrick found as a reference.
191	00:12:24	00:12:27	Hmm. Ink pads make for great exemplars.
192	00:12:27	00:12:32	And compare that to the print I pulled off the exit door and the knife... please.
193	00:12:32	00:12:33	Here you go.
194	00:12:39	00:12:41	Good characteristics here.
195	00:12:45	00:12:48	Match to the door handle.
196	00:12:50	00:12:53	And a match to the knife.
197	00:12:53	00:12:54	One print on the knife.
198	00:12:54	00:12:55	One print on the exit door.
199	00:12:56	00:12:57	Both belonging to the husband.
200	00:12:57	00:12:59	But we have two victims.
201	00:13:00	00:13:01	Speaking of twos...
202	00:13:01	00:13:05	I found blood from both victims on the knife.
203	00:13:05	00:13:08	So it's possible the husband killed the wife.
204	00:13:08	00:13:11	Who killed the husband?
205	00:13:29	00:13:33	Yeah, they look familiar-- from the neck up.
206	00:13:34	00:13:37	I must've given them four, five lap dances each.
207	00:13:37	00:13:39	They made my night.
208	00:13:39	00:13:40	So, they were George.
209	00:13:41	00:13:42	Big tippers.
210	00:13:42	00:13:43	No.
211	00:13:43	00:13:45	They weren't the ones paying for it.
212	00:13:45	00:13:47	The other couple was.
213	00:13:47	00:13:48	The other couple?
214	00:13:49	00:13:51	Yeah, we were all in the VIP booth over there.
215	00:13:57	00:13:59	The four of them-- they came in together.
216	00:13:59	00:14:00	The other couple just wanted to watch.
217	00:14:01	00:14:03	So I assumed they were friends.
218	00:14:03	00:14:04	Good friends.
219	00:14:12	00:14:16	I didn't get a good look at the other two, but they slid that money across the table...
220	00:14:16	00:14:18	mmm, brick this big.
221	00:14:18	00:14:22	So, like I said, they just wanted to doggie in the window.
222	00:14:23	00:14:25	Watch.
223	00:14:25	00:14:27	And they were subbing drinks left and right.
224	00:14:29	00:14:30	Ordering clear drinks to keep the party going.
225	00:14:30	00:14:31	What'd they order?
226	00:14:31	00:14:34	Two vodkas, two soda waters.
227	00:14:34	00:14:36	Guess who got the hard stuff.
228	00:14:42	00:14:43	Hi.
229	00:14:43	00:14:46	Would you like a dance?
230	00:14:53	00:14:54	Uh, I got to be at the courthouse.
231	00:14:54	00:14:57	Apparently, there's a last- minute evidentiary hearing in the Sam Braun case.
232	00:14:57	00:14:58	I need to be there.
233	00:14:58	00:15:00	You sure you don't want a dance?
234	00:15:00	00:15:02	I could be your specimen.
235	00:15:02	00:15:04	You could be my mad scientist.
236	00:15:06	00:15:07	He already is, sweetheart.
237	00:15:08	00:15:09	Thanks.
238	00:15:12	00:15:16	So, this is the last footage we have of the Dominguezes alive.
239	00:15:16	00:15:17	Who were they with?
240	00:15:17	00:15:19	Don't know, but check it out.
241	00:15:19	00:15:23	35.
242	00:15:23	00:15:25	This must be them, going down.
243	00:15:25	00:15:26	But coming up...
244	00:15:29	00:15:33	They're with the same mystery couple who brought up the Dominguezes.
245	00:15:33	00:15:37	35 couple, the ones that went up and down?
246	00:15:38	00:15:39	Freeze it there.
247	00:15:39	00:15:41	What's in his hand?
248	00:15:43	00:15:44	That's a room key.
249	00:15:46	00:15:50	Tangiers Hotel.
250	00:15:50	00:15:51	Do me a favor, Archie. Call Grissom.
251	00:15:51	00:15:56	New leads in the double homicide at the Sphere Hotel and Casino.
252	00:15:56	00:16:05	According to sources within the crime lab, the killer or killers most likely fled the room CSIs call Murder Central, the nearest room to the emergency exit.
253	00:16:06	00:16:11	CSIs are currently checking surveillance footage in an effort to identify possible suspects.
254	00:16:11	00:16:13	What the hell?
255	00:16:13	00:16:14	What?
256	00:16:18	00:16:19	Kenny Richmond, that's what.
257	00:16:20	00:16:21	Who's that?
258	00:16:21	00:16:24	This valet at the Sphere.
259	00:16:24	00:16:26	I played baseball in college with this guy.
260	00:16:26	00:16:28	I bumped into him for, like, two seconds.
261	00:16:28	00:16:30	Don't tell me you opened your mouth to the guy.
262	00:16:31	00:16:32	Hey, man.
263	00:16:32	00:16:34	You could lose your job over something like this.
264	00:16:34	00:16:37	Hey, it's not like I ran my mouth to the press, okay?
265	00:16:37	00:16:39	Best thing you could do is go to Grissom and 'fess up.
266	00:16:39	00:16:40	'Fess up to what?
267	00:16:40	00:16:42	There were a hundred people at that crime scene.
268	00:16:42	00:16:45	Anyone could have gone to a reporter and told them what was going on with the case, man.
269	00:16:45	00:16:47	Or what, you going to wait till he comes to you and then lie about it?
270	00:16:47	00:16:50	Lie about what?
271	00:17:10	00:17:14	Does this mean your murder case will not be going to trial, Mr. Braun?
272	00:17:14	00:17:17	Are you and your representatives in discussion with the District Attorney's office?
273	00:17:17	00:17:18	Could you elaborate on those discussions?
274	00:17:18	00:17:21	Do you feel vindicated by the judge's decision?
275	00:17:21	00:17:22	My client has no comment at this time.
276	00:17:22	00:17:26	Mr. Braun is looking forward to putting this whole unfortunate business behind him.
277	00:17:26	00:17:28	Mr. Braun, do you have anything to say at all, sir?
278	00:17:28	00:17:30	Mr. Braun, could we get a comment?
279	00:17:33	00:17:35	Mr. Braun, do you have anything to say at all, sir?
280	00:17:42	00:17:44	It was first names only.
281	00:17:44	00:17:47	Mandy and... Cameron?
282	00:17:47	00:17:48	Where'd you meet them?
283	00:17:48	00:17:50	Uh, at the roulette tables.
284	00:17:50	00:17:52	We were, uh...
285	00:17:52	00:17:57	We were drinking and they, uh, invited us back up to their room.
286	00:17:57	00:17:58	It was Vegas.
287	00:17:58	00:17:59	We were looking for a little excitement.
288	00:18:08	00:18:09	And did you find it?
289	00:18:09	00:18:10	No, not at all.
290	00:18:10	00:18:12	They... creeped us out.
291	00:18:12	00:18:13	How?
292	00:18:13	00:18:15	He, uh...
293	00:18:15	00:18:17	He asked me how much I loved my wife.
294	00:18:19	00:18:20	Is that a crazy question?
295	00:18:20	00:18:21	It wasn't the question.
296	00:18:22	00:18:22	It was...
297	00:18:23	00:18:24	the way he asked it.
298	00:18:24	00:18:27	How much do you love your wife?
299	00:18:28	00:18:29	Sobered me right up.
300	00:18:29	00:18:31	I mean, he didn't just ask it once.
301	00:18:31	00:18:37	He asked it... over and over again, and then Mandy asked how far we'd go to prove it.
302	00:18:37	00:18:38	Prove what?
303	00:18:38	00:18:39	To-to prove that.
304	00:18:40	00:18:42	To prove how much I loved my wife.
305	00:18:42	00:18:43	And, uh...
306	00:18:43	00:18:46	The next thing I know, she's naked.
307	00:18:46	00:18:50	Then she starts undoing his belt.
308	00:18:50	00:18:52	Which is the reason that we went up there in the first place.
309	00:18:52	00:18:54	Yeah, but you liked it a lot.
310	00:18:56	00:18:57	You could've waited.
311	00:18:58	00:18:58	Yeah.
312	00:18:59	00:19:01	We argue about everything.
313	00:19:02	00:19:04	And they saw us fighting.
314	00:19:04	00:19:06	And they kicked us out.
315	00:19:07	00:19:10	I don't know how fighting works for your marriage, but it probably saved your lives.
316	00:19:20	00:19:22	Need some help with that?
317	00:19:23	00:19:25	Help with what?
318	00:19:25	00:19:26	That weight on your shoulders.
319	00:19:28	00:19:29	That obvious, huh?
320	00:19:29	00:19:32	Yeah. What's up?
321	00:19:32	00:19:33	Oh...
322	00:19:33	00:19:35	Sam Braun.
323	00:19:35	00:19:38	Mm-hmm. I heard about that.
324	00:19:38	00:19:39	He made his bones in Vegas.
325	00:19:39	00:19:40	I mean, what do you expect?
326	00:19:40	00:19:42	The guy's bulletproof.
327	00:19:42	00:19:43	I'm not.
328	00:19:46	00:19:48	Want to talk about it?
329	00:19:48	00:19:54	Sam told me it takes a lifetime to establish a reputation and just a second to ruin it.
330	00:19:58	00:20:02	When I suspected that Sam was my father, I didn't go to him.
331	00:20:02	00:20:04	I didn't go to Grissom.
332	00:20:04	00:20:07	I went to Greg and had him run a DNA test.
333	00:20:07	00:20:09	On who?
334	00:20:09	00:20:10	On me.
335	00:20:10	00:20:11	What'd you use as an exemplar?
336	00:20:11	00:20:13	Blood evidence from his case.
337	00:20:13	00:20:16	That's why they kicked it.
338	00:20:16	00:20:18	Yup.
339	00:20:22	00:20:24	And I'm just afraid.
340	00:20:24	00:20:26	Of what?
341	00:20:29	00:20:32	A backlash.
342	00:20:45	00:20:48	You got a gut feeling on this one?
343	00:20:48	00:20:52	Well, if it's our serials, they've downgraded.
344	00:21:33	00:21:37	Well, we've got some ID.
345	00:21:37	00:21:39	Found her handbag.
346	00:21:39	00:21:41	Wendy Laggerman, aged 24.
347	00:21:41	00:21:42	She's not registered.
348	00:21:47	00:21:50	Where's her husband?
349	00:22:11	00:22:13	( shouts ) Oh, geez.
350	00:22:23	00:22:25	What was all that about?
351	00:22:25	00:22:27	False alarm.
352	00:22:27	00:22:29	Apparently, the guy just drove in from Fresno.
353	00:22:30	00:22:32	Fell asleep in his car, and didn't even check in yet.
354	00:22:38	00:22:39	Jesus!
355	00:22:39	00:22:40	Help!
356	00:22:40	00:22:42	Jesus! Whoa. Hey. Hey, buddy.
357	00:22:42	00:22:43	Geez. Take it easy. Take it easy.
358	00:23:04	00:23:06	This one's different.
359	00:23:07	00:23:09	Something's not right.
360	00:23:19	00:23:21	Okay, be careful, David.
361	00:23:21	00:23:23	The body's frozen, and it's in full rigor.
362	00:23:23	00:23:24	You're going to have to tilt it.
363	00:23:25	00:23:27	Tilt it, sir?
364	00:23:27	00:23:28	Yeah.
365	00:23:28	00:23:33	Downward 90-degree angle, then up, tilt, and out.
366	00:23:33	00:23:35	Okay. Uh...
367	00:23:35	00:23:36	All right, man.
368	00:23:36	00:23:37	Um...
369	00:23:37	00:23:39	I'll take the shoulders, you take the feet.
370	00:23:39	00:23:40	Okay. Okay?
371	00:23:40	00:23:42	You ready?
372	00:23:42	00:23:43	On three.
373	00:23:43	00:23:45	One, two, three, up.
374	00:23:45	00:23:46	And now tilt.
375	00:23:46	00:23:47	Come on. Up.
376	00:23:47	00:23:49	Okay, now tilt.
377	00:23:49	00:23:50	Oh, God.
378	00:23:50	00:23:52	Up more, tilt more. Now.
379	00:23:52	00:23:53	Uh, God.
380	00:23:53	00:23:54	Oh, down, down, put him down.
381	00:23:54	00:23:56	One more time. Ready, one time. One...
382	00:23:56	00:23:58	two, three, up.
383	00:23:59	00:24:00	Oh, God.
384	00:24:00	00:24:01	S-Sir, we can't get him.
385	00:24:01	00:24:02	Uh, his knee's bent.
386	00:24:02	00:24:05	Put him back down carefully.
387	00:24:23	00:24:25	There.
388	00:24:25	00:24:26	Now try.
389	00:24:30	00:24:32	Do we have to do the inventory on all this?
390	00:24:32	00:24:35	Yeah. What, 15 buckets?
391	00:24:35	00:24:37	This is our first bucket brigade together, gentlemen.
392	00:24:37	00:24:39	Try and say that ten times fast.
393	00:24:39	00:24:41	Bucket brigade. Bucket brigade. Bucket brigade.
394	00:24:41	00:24:42	We have to do this quickly.
395	00:24:42	00:24:44	It's 120 degrees outside, and our crime scene is melting.
396	00:25:25	00:25:27	Hold on a second.
397	00:25:31	00:25:33	I got something.
398	00:25:38	00:25:40	Whoa.
399	00:25:40	00:25:43	Would you like to bag this for me, Warrick? My hands are little numb.
400	00:25:56	00:25:57	Sara?
401	00:25:57	00:25:58	Yeah.
402	00:25:58	00:26:01	Would you take a sample of this blood for me?
403	00:26:01	00:26:01	Sure.
404	00:26:01	00:26:05	Warrick, help her process this.
405	00:26:05	00:26:06	Nick?
406	00:26:06	00:26:08	Yeah.
407	00:26:08	00:26:09	Come with me.
408	00:26:30	00:26:32	Shut the door, Nick.
409	00:26:32	00:26:35	You want to talk?
410	00:26:36	00:26:37	No.
411	00:26:37	00:26:40	I want to see the room the way they left it.
412	00:26:48	00:26:53	You know, if it's anything like the Sphere, we're probably not going to find much.
413	00:26:53	00:26:55	We're still going to look.
414	00:27:47	00:27:49	Bathroom's clean.
415	00:27:51	00:27:54	Haven't you ever seen one of those before?
416	00:27:54	00:27:57	Not in person, no.
417	00:27:57	00:27:58	Magic Fingers.
418	00:27:58	00:28:01	25 cents for 15 minutes of vibration.
419	00:28:01	00:28:06	Died a slow death in the '70s due to vandalism and seedy connotations.
420	00:28:06	00:28:07	Good for sex.
421	00:28:07	00:28:09	Good for sleep... too.
422	00:28:09	00:28:10	Good for us.
423	00:28:10	00:28:16	Given the killer's appetite for sexual persuasion, maybe they blew the circuit.
424	00:28:16	00:28:18	Overloaded it with coins.
425	00:28:18	00:28:20	And their prints on those coins.
426	00:28:49	00:28:51	Is that it? We're done?
427	00:28:51	00:28:53	I think so.
428	00:28:53	00:28:55	Well, power's back on.
429	00:28:58	00:29:01	So, why this place?
430	00:29:01	00:29:04	How do you go from the Sphere to the Fez?
431	00:29:06	00:29:09	What do you think, Nick?
432	00:29:11	00:29:14	A reporter got some inside information.
433	00:29:14	00:29:18	Killer probably heard about himself on the news, changed his MO.
434	00:29:18	00:29:20	Oh, great.
435	00:29:20	00:29:21	Help the bad guys.
436	00:29:21	00:29:24	I'm sure the Laggermans appreciate that.
437	00:29:25	00:29:29	I should probably get those quarters back to the lab, work on the prints.
438	00:29:50	00:29:53	I need 15 minutes to think.
439	00:29:58	00:30:00	Enjoy.
440	00:30:29	00:30:30	Hey.
441	00:30:30	00:30:32	Hey. Your spot of blood on the ice machine lid?
442	00:30:32	00:30:35	Yeah? We've got three alleles on several loci.
443	00:30:35	00:30:36	Is it a mixture of more than one stain?
444	00:30:36	00:30:38	One blood came back the vic's.
445	00:30:38	00:30:39	The other came back unknown.
446	00:30:39	00:30:41	Oh.
447	00:30:43	00:30:46	Chances are that's our killer.
448	00:30:47	00:30:52	So they lure their victims with the promise of sex.
449	00:30:56	00:30:58	And then they get them to the room.
450	00:30:59	00:31:02	And they say, Just kidding. We don't want sex.
451	00:31:02	00:31:03	We want your life.
452	00:31:03	00:31:07	It's about trust.
453	00:31:07	00:31:10	How much do you love your wife?
454	00:31:10	00:31:15	Which still doesn't explain how they get the husband to kill his wife.
455	00:31:15	00:31:20	They had to have been in some kind of situation where they couldn't say no.
456	00:31:20	00:31:22	They had a gun to his head.
457	00:31:22	00:31:29	If you want to live, you kill her by your own hands, or you both die.
458	00:31:29	00:31:32	They didn't think he was just going to walk away.
459	00:31:34	00:31:38	Maybe he was hoping to save his wife from something worse.
460	00:31:38	00:31:41	Tell me.
461	00:31:41	00:31:45	Do you love your wife enough to spare her the suffering?
462	00:31:45	00:31:49	Rape, torture, then murder.
463	00:31:49	00:31:52	If you want to live, you kill her by your own hand.
464	00:31:52	00:31:54	Or you both die.
465	00:31:56	00:31:58	It's just so sick.
466	00:32:04	00:32:06	Why did he stick him in the ice machine?
467	00:32:06	00:32:08	Well, I checked with the manager.
468	00:32:08	00:32:10	The vic was not registered.
469	00:32:10	00:32:13	No car.
470	00:32:13	00:32:15	So he had to improvise.
471	00:32:15	00:32:16	Where's your car?
472	00:32:16	00:32:17	We took a taxi.
473	00:32:17	00:32:18	Please don't kill me.
474	00:32:25	00:32:31	Well, knowing now there was an odd mixture of blood, it's safe to say that someone cut themselves.
475	00:32:31	00:32:35	Someone's got blood on their hands.
476	00:32:47	00:32:48	Mandy Klinefeld.
477	00:32:48	00:32:52	11546 Blackbird Lane.
478	00:32:53	00:32:54	Mandy and Cameron Klinefeld.
479	00:32:54	00:32:57	I just pulled their license photos off the DMV.
480	00:32:57	00:32:58	Brass showed them to the motel manager.
481	00:32:58	00:33:02	Couldn't ID, so... APBs are on the horn.
482	00:33:02	00:33:04	Come on, Grissom. It's got to be them.
483	00:33:04	00:33:06	Who stays at a motel when you live here?
484	00:33:07	00:33:08	Assume nothing, Nick.
485	00:33:16	00:33:17	Who found the car?
486	00:33:17	00:33:22	Green Valley Ranch security guard, the one that actually bothers to check the APB list.
487	00:33:29	00:33:33	Let's see, cabana number four.
488	00:33:36	00:33:38	There they are.
489	00:33:48	00:33:51	Cameron Klinefeld and Mandy Klinefeld?
490	00:33:51	00:33:54	Now that's not the cocktail waitress.
491	00:33:54	00:33:56	You and you go with this officer, please.
492	00:33:56	00:33:58	Thank you. Thank you.
493	00:34:01	00:34:04	You checked into the Fez last night under a false name.
494	00:34:04	00:34:09	We also suspect you of identity theft and felony fraud at the Sphere Hotel as well.
495	00:34:10	00:34:13	They don't have the magic fingers bed there, do they?
496	00:34:15	00:34:17	We were at the Fez last weekend.
497	00:34:17	00:34:19	I got a hooker. She watched.
498	00:34:19	00:34:21	She likes it. It gets her off.
499	00:34:21	00:34:22	What's the problem?
500	00:34:22	00:34:26	The problem is, people keep showing up dead in your hotel rooms.
501	00:34:26	00:34:28	What are you looking at, my feet?
502	00:34:28	00:34:30	No.
503	00:34:30	00:34:31	His feet, actually.
504	00:34:39	00:34:40	Shiny.
505	00:34:40	00:34:42	Isn't this harassment?
506	00:34:44	00:34:46	How much do you love your wife?
507	00:34:50	00:34:52	Love is not love.
508	00:34:52	00:34:54	Shakespeare?
509	00:34:54	00:34:58	Let me not the marriage of true minds...
510	00:34:58	00:35:01	...admit impediments Love is not love...
511	00:35:01	00:35:04	...but bears it out till the edge of doom.
512	00:35:05	00:35:07	One of the sonnets.
513	00:35:07	00:35:09	Love is conditional.
514	00:35:10	00:35:12	For most people.
515	00:35:13	00:35:15	But not for you.
516	00:35:25	00:35:26	Okay, here we go.
517	00:35:26	00:35:30	We've got a husband-and-wife serial team killing couples.
518	00:35:30	00:35:33	So, let's see where we're at starting with the first double murder.
519	00:35:33	00:35:34	Sara?
520	00:35:34	00:35:36	Bloody knife linking back to Alice Dominguez.
521	00:35:36	00:35:42	We suspect that Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
522	00:35:42	00:35:44	Come on. Do it.
523	00:35:44	00:35:48	Just cut her throat, and you can walk out of here.
524	00:35:48	00:35:52	That explains the thumbprint I found on the exit door leading to the garage.
525	00:35:52	00:35:54	What, they take him for a walk?
526	00:35:54	00:35:56	They were never going to let him go.
527	00:36:04	00:36:08	Doc Robbins found evidence of glitter on Mrs. Dominguez.
528	00:36:09	00:36:10	I also found glitter on Mr. Dominguez.
529	00:36:10	00:36:17	I found some on Mr. Klinefeld's shoes, so it's possible the Klinefelds picked up their first couple at Shimmer.
530	00:36:17	00:36:19	Did anyone at Shimmer ID the Klinefelds?
531	00:36:19	00:36:21	I didn't get a good look at the other two.
532	00:36:21	00:36:23	We didn't know who they were at the time.
533	00:36:23	00:36:25	Okay...
534	00:36:25	00:36:27	that's it for the first murder.
535	00:36:27	00:36:28	What about the second?
536	00:36:28	00:36:31	Uh, we've got prints on quarters.
537	00:36:31	00:36:33	We do have an admixture of blood off the ice machine.
538	00:36:33	00:36:35	What about prints on the ice machine knife?
539	00:36:35	00:36:37	Forget it.
540	00:36:37	00:36:38	Ice destroyed it.
541	00:36:38	00:36:42	Okay, so, uh, we're going to have to get into the Klinefelds' house.
542	00:36:42	00:36:44	If they haven't tossed the towels and sheets...
543	00:36:44	00:36:47	we may have something.
544	00:36:47	00:36:50	No. Uh, look, there's got to be some mistake.
545	00:36:50	00:36:55	We are this close to busting a pair of serial killers and the judge won't issue a warrant?
546	00:36:55	00:36:57	Hey, I'm just the messenger.
547	00:36:57	00:36:58	Give me the affidavit.
548	00:36:58	00:37:00	He won't sign it.
549	00:37:00	00:37:02	It's not the first time.
550	00:37:02	00:37:03	Sorry.
551	00:37:03	00:37:07	Look, I have signed hundreds of search warrants for Captain Brass, but...
552	00:37:08	00:37:10	this affidavit lacks probable cause.
553	00:37:10	00:37:13	Prints on quarters, an admixture of DNA...
554	00:37:13	00:37:15	DNA, if given a warrant, will clear or convict...
555	00:37:15	00:37:19	...are not enough for me Your Honor, to invade the Klinefelds' right to privacy.
556	00:37:19	00:37:21	with all due respect, you've signed warrants for less.
557	00:37:21	00:37:23	Yes... and where did it get me?
558	00:37:23	00:37:28	Just last week, the Appeals Court overturned one of our convictions, based on a search warrant I gave to one of your sidekicks.
559	00:37:28	00:37:32	We make a habit of this, I'm never going to get to the Foley Building.
560	00:37:32	00:37:33	Federal appointment.
561	00:37:34	00:37:35	What if they kill again?
562	00:37:35	00:37:36	All the more reason we need to get this right.
563	00:37:36	00:37:38	Unappealable.
564	00:37:38	00:37:39	The affidavit is thin.
565	00:37:39	00:37:43	You give me more... I'll give you more.
566	00:37:53	00:37:56	Funny, doesn't look like a doghouse.
567	00:37:57	00:37:59	Grissom ratted me out, huh?
568	00:37:59	00:38:02	Um, no, you ratted yourself out.
569	00:38:02	00:38:06	Hey, Nick, I know you're proud of what you do.
570	00:38:06	00:38:14	You're good at what you do, and you want people to know what you do, but once you open your mouth, it's all over 'cause what we say ends up in the news.
571	00:38:14	00:38:15	I guess I'm learning that the hard way, huh?
572	00:38:20	00:38:23	All right, ( clears throat), let's take a look.
573	00:38:27	00:38:34	You see, it looks like something got a little bit more interesting than roulette here.
574	00:38:34	00:38:38	So, if that's the lure, where's the catch?
575	00:38:39	00:38:43	Mm-hmm.
576	00:38:43	00:38:45	Clear drinks.
577	00:38:45	00:38:49	What do you want to bet the Rifkins are drinking vodka and the Klinefelds club soda.
578	00:38:49	00:38:52	Hmm.
579	00:38:55	00:38:56	Did you see that?
580	00:38:56	00:38:59	That was a little tongue action right there.
581	00:38:59	00:39:00	So, if we're creatures of habit...
582	00:39:00	00:39:05	If she stuck her tongue in Mr. Rifkin's ear, chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.
583	00:39:05	00:39:07	Mr. Dominguez has already been autopsied.
584	00:39:07	00:39:08	Washed from head-to-toe.
585	00:39:08	00:39:09	What about the ice man?
586	00:39:09	00:39:11	Coroners.
587	00:39:16	00:39:18	He's not picking up.
588	00:39:22	00:39:24	Oh, hey, Doc. Doc.
589	00:39:24	00:39:25	Where's the ice man?
590	00:39:25	00:39:27	Uh, David's cleaning him up.
591	00:39:28	00:39:29	David...
592	00:39:29	00:39:29	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
593	00:39:29	00:39:30	Drop the hose.
594	00:39:30	00:39:31	What did I do?
595	00:39:32	00:39:33	Did you go from head to toe or head to toe?
596	00:39:33	00:39:35	Toe to head.
597	00:39:35	00:39:36	Good.
598	00:39:36	00:39:38	Good answer.
599	00:39:51	00:39:52	You run with it.
600	00:40:08	00:40:09	We get it yet?
601	00:40:09	00:40:11	Any minute now.
602	00:40:12	00:40:16	Here it is.
603	00:40:19	00:40:21	Affirmative for female DNA.
604	00:40:23	00:40:26	Where are the admixture results from the ice machine?
605	00:40:26	00:40:28	Right here.
606	00:40:36	00:40:37	This is the same woman.
607	00:40:37	00:40:41	Whoever was in his ear was on that ice machine.
608	00:40:41	00:40:42	She's the killer.
609	00:40:43	00:40:44	Please, let me go.
610	00:40:44	00:40:45	Please, let me go. You guys...
611	00:40:58	00:41:02	This should get us a warrant.
612	00:41:20	00:41:24	Okay, split up. Go around the back.
613	00:41:40	00:41:43	Las Vegas Police. Mr and Mrs Klinefeld...
614	00:41:44	00:41:47	We have a warrant.
615	00:42:18	00:42:20	We got a problem...
616	00:42:25	00:42:27	Somebody got to our killers before we did.
