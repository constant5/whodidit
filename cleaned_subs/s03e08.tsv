0	0	00:00:45	00:00:49	Okay, this is where it got weird.	N
1	1	00:01:12	00:01:16	I've processed hundreds of bogus snuff films.	N
2	2	00:01:16	00:01:19	But this, this one just felt different.	N
3	3	00:01:19	00:01:22	Yeah, it should.	N
4	4	00:01:22	00:01:24	Arterial spray was real.	N
5	5	00:01:26	00:01:27	It's not fake blood.	N
6	6	00:01:27	00:01:29	It's human.	N
7	7	00:01:29	00:01:34	That was a murder... on 16 millimeter.	N
8	8	00:02:09	00:02:13	Has this pornographer sent you film to be developed in the past?	N
9	9	00:02:13	00:02:14	I'm sure he has.	N
10	10	00:02:14	00:02:18	We get raw film from hundreds of adult film companies.	N
11	11	00:02:18	00:02:21	No names, just those private boxes.	N
12	12	00:02:21	00:02:27	You can film porn, develop it, sell it, buy it but you can't send it through the U.S. mail.	N
13	13	00:02:27	00:02:32	I've got several envelopes here from various private shipping companies.	N
14	14	00:02:32	00:02:34	We'll be taking those with us as well.	N
15	15	00:02:35	00:02:36	Whatever.	N
16	16	00:02:40	00:02:41	Grissom.	N
17	17	00:02:41	00:02:42	It's Brass.	N
18	18	00:02:42	00:02:43	I got a d.b. out on Henderson Road.	N
19	19	00:02:44	00:02:45	I'm already on a case.	N
20	20	00:02:45	00:02:46	Yeah, well, reconsider.	N
21	21	00:02:46	00:02:48	I mean, these ants came flying out of the body.	N
22	22	00:02:48	00:02:49	They're taking chunks out of the coroner.	N
23	23	00:02:49	00:02:52	The CSI day guy says he's not going near the body again!	N
24	24	00:02:52	00:02:53	They're fire ants, Brass.	N
25	25	00:02:53	00:02:55	Keep everyone away from the colony.	N
26	26	00:02:55	00:02:56	They're evidence.	N
27	27	00:02:56	00:02:57	Reconsider.	N
28	28	00:02:57	00:02:58	Bring bug spray.	N
29	29	00:02:58	00:03:00	No bug spray.	N
30	30	00:03:00	00:03:04	So a kid was driving along and spotted the tool box.	N
31	31	00:03:04	00:03:06	He thought it would look good in his pickup truck.	N
32	32	00:03:07	00:03:08	So he looked inside and freaked out.	N
33	33	00:03:08	00:03:10	Ran to call for help.	N
34	34	00:03:10	00:03:13	Hey... Grissom you ever see anything like this?	N
35	35	00:03:13	00:03:17	Well, any species that finds itself in a place it doesn't belong can do this kind of damage.	N
36	36	00:03:17	00:03:18	What are you using?	N
37	37	00:03:18	00:03:19	Cortisone. That'll help.	N
38	38	00:03:19	00:03:22	You know, I heard that these things can kill a deer.	N
39	39	00:03:22	00:03:24	Is that... Is that right?	N
40	40	00:03:24	00:03:27	Well, with enough colonies they can kill people.	N
41	41	00:03:27	00:03:30	What about our person?	N
42	42	00:03:30	00:03:34	Well, only if they also learned how to put him in a box and dump him in a ditch.	N
43	43	00:03:42	00:03:45	Man or woman?	N
44	44	00:03:45	00:03:47	Ant hill.	N
45	45	00:03:47	00:03:50	They're using this body as a colony site.	N
46	46	00:03:50	00:03:55	I'm going to have to take this box and the specimen back to the lab as is.	N
47	47	00:03:55	00:03:57	These insects are evidence.	N
48	48	00:03:57	00:04:00	I followed up on the private mail depot for our snuff movie.	N
49	49	00:04:01	00:04:05	The place has got over 1,000 boxes no records of renters and they deal in cash only.	N
50	50	00:04:06	00:04:07	Dead trail. Yeah.	N
51	51	00:04:07	00:04:11	I got Archie to digitize that film blow up a head shot of our victim.	N
52	52	00:04:11	00:04:14	I find any missing persons that match her description, I'll beep you.	N
53	53	00:04:14	00:04:15	Thanks, Sulik.	N
54	54	00:04:17	00:04:18	Find any fingerprints?	N
55	55	00:04:18	00:04:20	I should be able to.	N
56	56	00:04:20	00:04:22	Imaging components on a filmstrip are held together by gelatin.	N
57	57	00:04:22	00:04:25	Same stuff that makes Jell-O jiggle but they're smudged.	N
58	58	00:04:25	00:04:31	I can tell you that the film was manufactured in 2002 by a big company.	N
59	59	00:04:31	00:04:33	Homicide's contacting them now to get a buyer's list.	N
60	60	00:04:33	00:04:34	Won't help.	N
61	61	00:04:34	00:04:37	Pornos buy short ends from legitimate clearing houses.	N
62	62	00:04:37	00:04:40	Saves money and they're impossible to trace.	N
63	63	00:04:40	00:04:42	Really?	N
64	64	00:04:42	00:04:44	I pulled a porno ring using teenage girls a couple years ago.	N
65	65	00:04:44	00:04:48	Learned all you want to know about the adult entertainment industry.	N
66	66	00:04:49	00:04:52	Hell of a way to go.	N
67	67	00:04:53	00:04:58	I always thought that snuff films were an urban myth I mean, outside of urban Bangkok.	N
68	68	00:04:58	00:05:01	FBI's official position on snuff films in the U.S. of A?	Y
69	69	00:05:01	00:05:02	No such thing.	N
70	70	00:05:02	00:05:04	What's their unofficial position?	N
71	71	00:05:04	00:05:08	Single film goes for 100 grand... original negative.	N
72	72	00:05:08	00:05:14	And this snuff filmmaker decided to send his film out to get processed.	N
73	73	00:05:14	00:05:17	Greedy doesn't mean smart.	N
74	74	00:05:22	00:05:24	Come on, you bitch!	N
75	75	00:05:26	00:05:28	I'm allergic to red ants, you know.	N
76	76	00:05:28	00:05:31	Yeah? I put them on my eggs.	N
77	77	00:05:31	00:05:33	If they're dead, I hope.	N
78	78	00:05:44	00:05:48	Something tells me that isn't Black Flag.	N
79	79	00:05:48	00:05:52	Ecozone Pyrethrum.	N
80	80	00:05:52	00:05:58	Toxic to ants, fleas roaches and silverfish.	N
81	81	00:05:58	00:06:02	And how does an entomologist feel about putting ants to death?	N
82	82	00:06:02	00:06:05	I view them as martyrs in a scientist's holy war.	N
83	83	00:06:06	00:06:08	I see.	N
84	84	00:06:08	00:06:09	Man without a face.	N
85	85	00:06:09	00:06:10	Timeline for death?	N
86	86	00:06:10	00:06:13	Hard to say between the insects and the elements.	N
87	87	00:06:13	00:06:15	At least a year.	N
88	88	00:06:15	00:06:17	It smells more like two.	N
89	89	00:06:17	00:06:20	Multiple fractures of both clavicles.	N
90	90	00:06:20	00:06:26	Right clavicle healed... broken four months before death.	N
91	91	00:06:26	00:06:27	Left was more recent...	N
92	92	00:06:27	00:06:30	hairline fractures are still present.	N
93	93	00:06:30	00:06:32	Give me a hand turning him over, will you?	N
94	94	00:06:39	00:06:40	What are these?	N
95	95	00:06:41	00:06:42	I'm not sure.	N
96	96	00:06:42	00:06:46	Sharp impact wounds to the interscapular.	N
97	97	00:06:47	00:06:49	Same trauma here in the vertebrel.	N
98	98	00:06:49	00:06:51	Stab wounds?	N
99	99	00:06:51	00:06:53	I can't say.	N
100	100	00:06:53	00:06:57	Uh, maybe some round weapon of some sort.	N
101	101	00:06:57	00:07:00	What, two feet apart?	N
102	102	00:07:00	00:07:02	More like 18 inches.	N
103	103	00:07:10	00:07:12	What?	N
104	104	00:07:14	00:07:16	A pupa case.	N
105	105	00:07:18	00:07:20	Is that a good thing or a bad thing?	N
106	106	00:07:20	00:07:21	It's a good thing.	N
107	107	00:07:21	00:07:26	If I can postdate the pupa I can establish an entomological timeline.	N
108	108	00:07:26	00:07:29	Okay, all right, let's run this back again from the beginning.	N
109	109	00:07:29	00:07:32	This time without the sound.	N
110	110	00:07:34	00:07:36	All right.	N
111	111	00:07:39	00:07:40	Stop.	N
112	112	00:07:41	00:07:44	Can you zoom in on his back?	N
113	113	00:07:48	00:07:49	What is that?	N
114	114	00:07:49	00:07:51	A mole?	N
115	115	00:07:51	00:07:53	Non-cancerous.	N
116	116	00:07:53	00:07:54	You think?	N
117	117	00:07:54	00:07:55	Too bad, the bastard.	N
118	118	00:07:55	00:07:59	This room is like a dime a dozen It could be anywhere in Vegas.	N
119	119	00:07:59	00:08:06	Between the drapes can you get any other detail outside of that window?	N
120	120	00:08:06	00:08:07	Uh...	N
121	121	00:08:07	00:08:11	I'll reverse the polarization see if we can get any more information from this frame.	N
122	122	00:08:11	00:08:15	That looks like a blob outside of the window.	N
123	123	00:08:15	00:08:17	It's spherical.	N
124	124	00:08:17	00:08:18	Blow it up.	N
125	125	00:08:21	00:08:23	Times ten.	N
126	126	00:08:23	00:08:25	The Stratosphere Tower.	N
127	127	00:08:25	00:08:27	South face maybe?	N
128	128	00:08:27	00:08:33	Using that Stratosphere Tower as a point of reference could you triangulate and pinpoint the street that this was filmed on?	N
129	129	00:08:33	00:08:35	I can.	N
130	130	00:08:41	00:08:43	Hotel's in receivership.	N
131	131	00:08:43	00:08:45	The security guy says the elevator still works.	N
132	132	00:08:46	00:08:47	We're going to need to talk to him.	N
133	133	00:08:47	00:08:50	Soon as he gets off the phone with the owner.	N
134	134	00:09:01	00:09:02	What's up?	N
135	135	00:09:02	00:09:04	Oh, nothing.	N
136	136	00:09:04	00:09:08	Only difference between kitsch and beautiful is time.	N
137	137	00:09:14	00:09:17	Heard you're doing a timeline on the ant man.	N
138	138	00:09:17	00:09:19	Slow day in DNA, Greg?	N
139	139	00:09:19	00:09:22	Yeah.	N
140	140	00:09:22	00:09:25	You know, I, uh... I can take notes.	N
141	141	00:09:25	00:09:29	Very good. Go right ahead.	N
142	142	00:09:29	00:09:35	body dies.	N
143	143	00:09:35	00:09:40	green blowflies arrive...	N
144	144	00:09:40	00:09:46	and leave their pupal casings.	N
145	145	00:09:46	00:09:52	black soldier flies move in.	N
146	146	00:09:52	00:09:58	At week 28... they leave their pupa casings.	N
147	147	00:09:58	00:10:08	Now, the presence of winged reproductive fire ants suggests that their colony was in existence for at least a year.	N
148	148	00:10:12	00:10:22	Now, since we found no more pupa casings after the black soldier flies left at week 28 we know that this is when the fire ants must've first arrived.	N
149	149	00:10:22	00:10:27	So, calculating the gestation period between ants and flies, we get...	N
150	150	00:10:30	00:10:33	One year plus the 28 weeks...	N
151	151	00:10:35	00:10:37	the guy's been dead 19 months.	N
152	152	00:10:38	00:10:40	Very good.	N
153	153	00:10:40	00:10:43	It's an approximation, but it's a start.	N
154	154	00:10:48	00:10:53	Well... Sara, you take that one.	N
155	155	00:10:53	00:10:56	Warrick, you go there, I'll go in here.	N
156	156	00:11:33	00:11:34	Hey, guys?	N
157	157	00:11:36	00:11:38	We got it.	N
158	158	00:11:42	00:11:45	Somebody moved out all the furniture.	N
159	159	00:11:45	00:11:47	And painted the wall.	N
160	160	00:11:53	00:11:57	If they can't see it, we can't, huh?	N
161	161	00:12:14	00:12:17	Arterial spray.	N
162	162	00:12:20	00:12:22	There's a void.	N
163	163	00:12:22	00:12:25	Could be a face?	N
164	164	00:12:25	00:12:28	Yeah, maybe.	N
165	165	00:12:28	00:12:32	How does somebody cross the line where killing a woman is a turn-on?	N
166	166	00:12:32	00:12:34	Oh, I don't think snuff makers cross a line, Sara.	N
167	167	00:12:34	00:12:36	I think they start on the other side of it.	N
168	168	00:12:36	00:12:39	Biology determining pathology.	N
169	169	00:12:39	00:12:42	Yeah, some people were just born bad.	N
170	170	00:12:42	00:12:43	Where's that security guard?	N
171	171	00:12:49	00:12:51	How long you been a day guard here?	N
172	172	00:12:51	00:12:53	Four months.	N
173	173	00:12:53	00:12:56	But I don't know anything about this murder you're talking about.	Y
174	174	00:12:56	00:12:59	Do you anything about who painted Room 918?	Y
175	175	00:12:59	00:13:00	No idea.	N
176	176	00:13:00	00:13:02	You should try a scalp conditioner.	Y
177	177	00:13:02	00:13:04	What? Your dandruff.	N
178	178	00:13:04	00:13:08	Oh, my bad... primer.	N
179	179	00:13:08	00:13:12	Alkyd-based.	N
180	180	00:13:12	00:13:16	Never comes out in the wash but you already know that.	N
181	181	00:13:16	00:13:18	Warrick?	N
182	182	00:13:23	00:13:26	You were in that snuff film.	N
183	183	00:13:26	00:13:27	You stabbed that girl.	N
184	184	00:13:28	00:13:30	I let them use the room to make a movie, that's all.	N
185	185	00:13:30	00:13:32	Yeah, we saw you in the movie.	N
186	186	00:13:32	00:13:33	You and your nice mole.	N
187	187	00:13:33	00:13:36	The guy threw in another $200 if I had sex with the girl.	N
188	188	00:13:36	00:13:39	She was hot, so I figured why not?	N
189	189	00:13:39	00:13:40	Did her and left.	N
190	190	00:13:40	00:13:42	She was breathing fine.	N
191	191	00:13:42	00:13:46	So when you came back in the room and you saw the blood on the wall did you think to call the police?	N
192	192	00:13:46	00:13:49	I didn't want to lose my job.	N
193	193	00:13:49	00:13:51	Oh, touching.	N
194	194	00:13:51	00:13:53	Arrest him.	N
195	195	00:13:53	00:13:54	Turn around.	N
196	196	00:14:04	00:14:06	I see you're now learning to cook for yourself.	N
197	197	00:14:08	00:14:11	Well, I had to, Teri I heard you were married.	N
198	198	00:14:11	00:14:12	Hopefully not to a criminalist.	N
199	199	00:14:12	00:14:14	You think I'm stupid?	N
200	200	00:14:14	00:14:16	He's a teacher.	N
201	201	00:14:16	00:14:18	Well, congratulations.	N
202	202	00:14:18	00:14:20	Thank you.	N
203	203	00:14:20	00:14:21	So what's the special occasion?	N
204	204	00:14:22	00:14:25	I have someone I'd like you to introduce me to.	N
205	205	00:14:30	00:14:32	What, did I miss something?	N
206	206	00:14:32	00:14:36	Actually, yes.	Y
207	207	00:14:45	00:14:46	It's a dung beetle.	N
208	208	00:14:46	00:14:48	Probably hid in the nasal cavity.	Y
209	209	00:14:48	00:14:50	The ants ate everything but the exoskeleton.	N
210	210	00:14:50	00:14:51	Mm-hmm.	Y
211	211	00:14:51	00:14:55	So he was probably murdered near some large animals.	Y
212	212	00:14:56	00:14:58	Maybe a farm or a zoo.	N
213	213	00:14:58	00:15:03	Anyway, as to who, I'll leave that up to you.	N
214	214	00:15:03	00:15:05	Will do.	N
215	215	00:15:26	00:15:28	Damn, security guard was telling the truth.	N
216	216	00:15:28	00:15:29	There is another guy there.	N
217	217	00:15:29	00:15:34	He's almost one and three-quarter inches taller than the security guard.	N
218	218	00:15:34	00:15:37	Our minds must've filled in the negative space.	N
219	219	00:15:37	00:15:39	Look, the security guard just left the room.	N
220	220	00:15:39	00:15:40	You see the door shadow right there.	N
221	221	00:15:44	00:15:45	The camera stopped moving.	N
222	222	00:15:45	00:15:48	That's because he's not behind it, he's in front of it.	N
223	223	00:15:48	00:15:51	Well, then, that's our guy.	N
224	224	00:15:51	00:15:53	There's got to be some way to I.D. him.	N
225	225	00:15:53	00:15:56	I have enlarged and re-enlarged every frame.	N
226	226	00:15:56	00:15:59	There's no tats, there's no birthmarks, nothing.	N
227	227	00:15:59	00:16:00	What about the rest of the room?	N
228	228	00:16:01	00:16:03	The film picks up everything there is to see, Catherine.	N
229	229	00:16:03	00:16:04	We've seen everything.	N
230	230	00:16:04	00:16:07	Maybe there's a short end.	N
231	231	00:16:07	00:16:08	What?	N
232	232	00:16:08	00:16:12	Pornos use short ends of film which means they never know when the film is going to run out.	N
233	233	00:16:12	00:16:13	Roll out.	N
234	234	00:16:13	00:16:17	Camera slows down, the last frame stutters gets hit with more light.	N
235	235	00:16:19	00:16:23	So there's more visual information on the negative.	N
236	236	00:16:23	00:16:24	Right.	N
237	237	00:16:24	00:16:27	Good editors always cut the roll out.	N
238	238	00:16:29	00:16:31	So all your editors' cuttings are in there?	N
239	239	00:16:31	00:16:34	Yep. Negatives and unused dailies.	N
240	240	00:16:34	00:16:36	Collection guy comes by once a week.	N
241	241	00:16:37	00:16:41	Silver on the film makes it environmentally unsafe for landfill, so...	N
242	242	00:16:41	00:16:44	Be nice if people were as concerned about the women in these films.	N
243	243	00:16:44	00:16:46	I am the one who called y'all, remember?	N
244	244	00:16:46	00:16:49	Knock yourselves out, ladies.	N
245	245	00:16:50	00:16:51	Thank you.	N
246	246	00:16:51	00:16:54	Thank you.	N
247	247	00:16:54	00:16:56	Bins of sin.	N
248	248	00:16:56	00:16:59	Well, looks like mostly 35 millimeter.	N
249	249	00:16:59	00:17:03	Our 16 should've settled at the bottom.	N
250	250	00:17:52	00:17:55	What the heck is that?	N
251	251	00:17:55	00:17:57	What did Trace say?	N
252	252	00:17:57	00:17:59	Carbon steel. There was some rust on it.	N
253	253	00:17:59	00:18:00	Carbon steel? 19th century.	N
254	254	00:18:01	00:18:02	Mostly used for surgical instruments.	N
255	255	00:18:02	00:18:05	Well, you found some stab wounds on the vic, right?	N
256	256	00:18:05	00:18:06	Underneath all those ants?	N
257	257	00:18:06	00:18:08	Maybe it's somebody's old scalpel.	N
258	258	00:18:08	00:18:11	This prong-like extension could be part of a repeating pattern.	N
259	259	00:18:11	00:18:12	Geometrical extrapolation?	N
260	260	00:18:13	00:18:14	That would give us possibilities.	N
261	261	00:18:14	00:18:16	You got a pencil?	N
262	262	00:18:18	00:18:22	From the tip down, the slope looks to be slightly curved.	N
263	263	00:18:22	00:18:27	Now, if I extend that trace outward...	N
264	264	00:18:33	00:18:36	What do you think? Blade of a saw.	N
265	265	00:18:36	00:18:40	Keep doing the math, maybe we won't have to guess.	N
266	266	00:18:40	00:18:43	You see how the base of the fragment curves downward?	N
267	267	00:18:43	00:18:46	Suggesting something circular.	N
268	268	00:18:55	00:18:58	Repeating pattern.	N
269	269	00:18:58	00:19:01	Circular saw, maybe.	N
270	270	00:19:05	00:19:08	This doesn't seem sharp enough for a saw.	N
271	271	00:19:10	00:19:11	Wait a minute.	N
272	272	00:19:12	00:19:14	I've seen one of these before, man.	N
273	273	00:19:14	00:19:18	A spur... cheap spur.	Y
274	274	00:19:18	00:19:19	What's that old cowboy expression?	N
275	275	00:19:19	00:19:21	Got to see a man about a horse.	N
276	276	00:19:22	00:19:24	That reminds me.	N
277	277	00:19:24	00:19:26	I got to see a woman about a face.	N
278	278	00:19:26	00:19:27	Yee-haw.	N
279	279	00:19:27	00:19:33	You notice all the guys in these movies are wearing condoms?	N
280	280	00:19:33	00:19:36	Yeah, industry policy.	N
281	281	00:19:36	00:19:38	Ever since '98.	N
282	282	00:19:38	00:19:41	who's positive, who's not.	N
283	283	00:19:41	00:19:44	And that security guy wore one, too.	N
284	284	00:19:44	00:19:47	Pretty surprising for unregulated porn.	N
285	285	00:19:47	00:19:50	Maybe she made him wear one.	N
286	286	00:19:51	00:19:53	I got it.	N
287	287	00:19:53	00:19:54	You did?	N
288	288	00:19:54	00:19:55	I got it, I found it.	N
289	289	00:19:55	00:19:57	Thank God.	N
290	290	00:19:59	00:20:04	Hot frame, all right.	N
291	291	00:20:04	00:20:06	I still can't see who it is.	N
292	292	00:20:06	00:20:08	You can see a little more of the room, though.	N
293	293	00:20:08	00:20:11	There's a small table and a lamp in the left corner.	N
294	294	00:20:12	00:20:14	Good eye, Sara.	N
295	295	00:20:14	00:20:18	Yeah, that kitsch lamp.	N
296	296	00:20:18	00:20:21	Somebody moved it out to the lobby.	N
297	297	00:20:21	00:20:24	I'll have Warrick go back to the hotel and grab it.	N
298	298	00:20:31	00:20:34	Tissue depth markers.	N
299	299	00:20:34	00:20:36	21 of them, right?	N
300	300	00:20:36	00:20:37	16 actually.	N
301	301	00:20:37	00:20:40	Excluding five nasal markers.	N
302	302	00:20:40	00:20:41	Like I said.	N
303	303	00:20:42	00:20:44	This one's very interesting.	N
304	304	00:20:44	00:20:49	The occiput the bump on the back center of the head unusually flat.	N
305	305	00:21:00	00:21:02	The eyes have epicanthal folds.	N
306	306	00:21:02	00:21:08	A triangular flap of skin that gives a vaguely Asian appearance.	N
307	307	00:21:09	00:21:12	You see how the bridge of the nose is poorly developed?	N
308	308	00:21:12	00:21:15	Almost too small for the size of his head.	N
309	309	00:21:15	00:21:18	The ears seem slightly odd.	N
310	310	00:21:18	00:21:21	Like the nose they too, are disproportionate to the head.	N
311	311	00:21:21	00:21:24	Almost childlike.	N
312	312	00:21:28	00:21:37	These elements are small for the head which, in itself, is almost too short and wide.	Y
313	313	00:21:37	00:21:43	Your victim was born with trisomy of the twenty-first chromosome.	Y
314	314	00:21:43	00:21:45	Down's Syndrome.	N
315	315	00:21:56	00:22:01	So I sent out a community fax to every Down's Syndrome link in Clark and the surrounding counties.	N
316	316	00:22:01	00:22:05	Special Olympics-type groups, societies, schools and I got lucky.	N
317	317	00:22:05	00:22:09	Randy Traschel, age 25. Been missing for 17 months.	N
318	318	00:22:10	00:22:12	I guess my ants were off a little.	N
319	319	00:22:12	00:22:15	Las Vegas Ranch.	N
320	320	00:22:15	00:22:19	Horses. Dung beetles.	N
321	321	00:22:19	00:22:21	Hey, where's the tote board?	N
322	322	00:22:21	00:22:24	Every time I see a horse, I want to place a bet.	N
323	323	00:22:24	00:22:26	Smells like Belmont Park, doesn't it?	N
324	324	00:22:26	00:22:28	You ever ridden a horse, Grissom?	N
325	325	00:22:28	00:22:30	Nope, just roller coasters.	N
326	326	00:22:40	00:22:42	Howdy.	N
327	327	00:22:42	00:22:44	Pete Banson.	N
328	328	00:22:44	00:22:46	Ranch manager.	N
329	329	00:22:46	00:22:47	Howdy.	N
330	330	00:22:47	00:22:49	Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.	N
331	331	00:22:49	00:22:52	This is Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes of the crime lab.	N
332	332	00:22:52	00:22:53	What seems to be the trouble?	N
333	333	00:22:53	00:22:56	Have you ever seen this man?	N
334	334	00:22:56	00:22:58	Yeah, he's one of my stall muckers.	Y
335	335	00:22:58	00:23:00	Hired him about a year and a half ago.	Y
336	336	00:23:00	00:23:03	A little slow in the head, but got the work done.	Y
337	337	00:23:03	00:23:08	And all of a sudden, he up and disappeared never heard from him since then.	N
338	338	00:23:15	00:23:19	Did he ever ride horses for you, Mr. Banson?	Y
339	339	00:23:19	00:23:23	No, he just mucked the stalls and went home.	N
340	340	00:23:24	00:23:26	Who mucks your stalls now?	N
341	341	00:23:26	00:23:28	Look, guys, am I in some kind of trouble here?	N
342	342	00:23:28	00:23:30	A former employee of yours was murdered.	N
343	343	00:23:30	00:23:32	Now, who mucks?	N
344	344	00:23:32	00:23:35	Enrique. He's an illegal.	N
345	345	00:23:35	00:23:36	Shocking.	N
346	346	00:23:36	00:23:37	Where is he?	N
347	347	00:23:46	00:23:49	There's the lamp I got from the lobby.	Y
348	348	00:23:50	00:23:52	The bulb is red...	Y
349	349	00:23:52	00:23:54	in the film and here.	Y
350	350	00:23:54	00:23:57	Guy thinks he's Zalman King, playing with the lighting.	Y
351	351	00:23:58	00:24:00	I guess he was going for a certain look.	Y
352	352	00:24:04	00:24:08	You know, if I had screwed a hot light bulb I'd probably lick my fingers.	Y
353	353	00:24:08	00:24:11	Saliva.	N
354	354	00:24:15	00:24:19	Guy replaced it with a red bulb. Got residual saliva on it.	Y
355	355	00:24:20	00:24:23	Process for DNA, run it through CODIS.	Y
356	356	00:24:45	00:24:46	Douglas Sampson?	Y
357	357	00:24:46	00:24:48	Yeah.	Y
358	358	00:24:48	00:24:52	The same Douglas Sampson who did three years for sexual assault and battery?	Y
359	359	00:24:53	00:24:56	Did. Past tense.	N
360	360	00:24:56	00:24:59	We want to talk to you about a recent homicide at the Mandolin Tower Hotel, off Fremont.	Y
361	361	00:24:59	00:25:01	I'm working.	Y
362	362	00:25:06	00:25:08	Take a break.	N
363	363	00:25:10	00:25:12	Take ten. Give it a rest, guys.	N
364	364	00:25:16	00:25:19	I bet I could guess your exact height.	N
365	365	00:25:19	00:25:20	What?	N
366	366	00:25:20	00:25:24	That guy out front just confirmed you shot a snuff film with this girl at the Mandolin Tower Hotel.	N
367	367	00:25:24	00:25:26	I've stayed there over the years.	N
368	368	00:25:26	00:25:28	I never saw her with that guy out front.	Y
369	369	00:25:28	00:25:31	We've got you on film, killing her.	Y
370	370	00:25:31	00:25:34	If you had me from any angle I could be identified you would've arrested me already.	Y
371	371	00:25:35	00:25:38	We've got ourselves a film student here.	Y
372	372	00:25:38	00:25:41	I'm one of the best in adult film and I'm going to be making the jump to mainstream, you watch.	Y
373	373	00:25:41	00:25:43	Financed by a snuff film?	N
374	374	00:25:43	00:25:45	You have no right to be in my house.	N
375	375	00:25:45	00:25:46	I'm not breaking any laws.	N
376	376	00:25:46	00:25:49	I have a permit for adult film production.	N
377	377	00:25:49	00:25:50	You leave now or I'm going to file a complaint.	N
378	378	00:25:52	00:25:54	Getting a cold?	N
379	379	00:25:54	00:25:55	Maybe you should raise the heat.	N
380	380	00:25:55	00:25:57	I'm sure they wouldn't mind.	N
381	381	00:26:00	00:26:02	Hey, what do you got?	N
382	382	00:26:02	00:26:05	This is Sampson's car, right?	N
383	383	00:26:05	00:26:07	Some soil up in his wheel well.	N
384	384	00:26:07	00:26:09	He washed the tire and forgot the well.	N
385	385	00:26:09	00:26:10	Butterscotch?	N
386	386	00:26:10	00:26:11	Yeah.	N
387	387	00:26:11	00:26:14	Remember that body dump a couple years back?	N
388	388	00:26:14	00:26:15	Yeah.	N
389	389	00:26:15	00:26:16	Down near the Colorado?	N
390	390	00:26:16	00:26:19	Bidahochy Range. Butterscotch-colored soil.	N
391	391	00:26:19	00:26:22	I'll radio the sheriff up there. And the park rangers.	N
392	392	00:26:22	00:26:25	Great.	N
393	393	00:26:25	00:26:26	You never met this man?	N
394	394	00:26:26	00:26:28	No.	N
395	395	00:26:28	00:26:29	Stop the shoveling.	Y
396	396	00:26:29	00:26:31	Take a closer look.	Y
397	397	00:26:31	00:26:34	All I know about him is they call him Stubs.	Y
398	398	00:26:35	00:26:36	Stubs.	N
399	399	00:26:36	00:26:37	What is that, some kind of nickname?	N
400	400	00:26:37	00:26:39	I guess.	N
401	401	00:26:39	00:26:41	I hear the cowboys joking about him.	N
402	402	00:26:41	00:26:43	I think they call him that because of his fingers.	N
403	403	00:26:43	00:26:46	Did the other cowboys ever make fun of him?	N
404	404	00:26:46	00:26:49	I really don't know.	N
405	405	00:26:50	00:26:53	Do you ride, Mr. Vasquez?	N
406	406	00:26:53	00:26:54	Every day.	N
407	407	00:26:54	00:26:55	You wear spurs when you ride?	Y
408	408	00:26:55	00:26:57	When I'm breaking a horse, yes.	Y
409	409	00:26:57	00:26:59	You don't call this breaking a horse, do you?	Y
410	410	00:26:59	00:27:02	I forgot to take them off.	Y
411	411	00:27:02	00:27:07	I'm going to need to take a look at those spurs, Mr. Vasquez.	Y
412	412	00:27:30	00:27:33	Enrique said he got those boots and spurs from Hero's Row.	N
413	413	00:27:33	00:27:37	Mm-hmm. That's where the cowboys toss all their unwanted gear.	N
414	414	00:27:37	00:27:41	And they just leave them there for anyone to pick up?	N
415	415	00:27:41	00:27:42	It's either that or Goodwill.	N
416	416	00:27:43	00:27:52	Hmm. Mr. Banson, the Pro Rodeo Association banned sharp rowels on spurs back in the early '70s because they were found to be cruel to horses.	N
417	417	00:27:52	00:27:54	Yeah, I know all about that.	N
418	418	00:27:54	00:28:00	I don't particularly agree with it 'cause as far as I'm concerned horses are on this earth to service human beings.	N
419	419	00:28:00	00:28:02	There's an order to things.	N
420	420	00:28:02	00:28:05	Well, somebody on your ranch is stuck in the '70s.	N
421	421	00:28:05	00:28:08	Do you have any idea who this spur could belong to?	N
422	422	00:28:10	00:28:12	Billy Rattison. Pro bronc rider.	N
423	423	00:28:15	00:28:15	Brown.	N
424	424	00:28:15	00:28:17	I think we got your snuff film girl.	N
425	425	00:28:17	00:28:18	Where?	N
426	426	00:28:18	00:28:19	By the river.	N
427	427	00:28:19	00:28:21	Okay, I'll be right there.	N
428	428	00:28:50	00:28:53	Warrick stick you with post?	N
429	429	00:28:53	00:28:55	He's working evidence from the riverbed.	N
430	430	00:28:55	00:28:57	You going to be able to I.D. her?	N
431	431	00:28:57	00:28:58	Already did, from her dental records.	Y
432	432	00:28:58	00:29:00	Susan Hodap, 26.	Y
433	433	00:29:00	00:29:05	Exsanguination from a trans-section of the carotid artery.	N
434	434	00:29:05	00:29:06	Slicing stab.	N
435	435	00:29:06	00:29:10	Any chance of finding any serration marks on the bone?	Y
436	436	00:29:10	00:29:11	To tie to a knife?	N
437	437	00:29:11	00:29:15	Eh, that'll entail a boil, but sure, I can try.	N
438	438	00:29:15	00:29:19	What I can tell you conclusively is that Susan Hodap was already on borrowed time.	Y
439	439	00:29:19	00:29:26	I tapped her cerebral spinal fluid didn't wait for a batch, had the lab run it solo.	Y
440	440	00:29:26	00:29:28	She was HIV positive.	Y
441	441	00:29:32	00:29:34	Susan Hodap...	Y
442	442	00:29:40	00:29:43	There it is.	Y
443	443	00:29:43	00:29:46	Tested positive six months ago.	Y
444	444	00:29:49	00:29:52	I can't believe that porn actors' monthly health records are on the Internet.	Y
445	445	00:29:52	00:29:53	Yeah, right.	Y
446	446	00:29:53	00:29:58	The rule is, the actor tests positive twice they go on permanent quarantine.	Y
447	447	00:30:03	00:30:05	That's why she ended up in that snuff film.	N
448	448	00:30:05	00:30:06	She got bounced out of regular porn.	N
449	449	00:30:06	00:30:09	Walked right into her own death scene.	N
450	450	00:30:09	00:30:12	The thing is...	Y
451	451	00:30:12	00:30:14	porn director may have, too.	N
452	452	00:30:26	00:30:30	This would be a pretty cool little truck if it weren't for the shiny new toolbox.	Y
453	453	00:30:30	00:30:32	Yeah. And it might be his.	Y
454	454	00:30:35	00:30:36	See you boys are back again.	Y
455	455	00:30:36	00:30:39	Mr. Banson, is this Billy Rattison's truck?	Y
456	456	00:30:39	00:30:41	Yes, sir. It is.	N
457	457	00:30:41	00:30:43	We need to speak with him.	N
458	458	00:30:46	00:30:49	I don't know nothing about no damn retard.	N
459	459	00:30:49	00:30:52	He wasn't a retard, Mr. Rattison.	Y
460	460	00:30:52	00:30:55	He had what we call Down's Syndrome.	N
461	461	00:30:55	00:30:57	I don't care what he had.	N
462	462	00:30:57	00:30:59	Always sticking his nose where it don't belong.	N
463	463	00:31:04	00:31:05	You left this?	N
464	464	00:31:06	00:31:07	I left it on the post.	N
465	465	00:31:07	00:31:10	I don't want it in my pocket when I ride.	N
466	466	00:31:10	00:31:12	Damn!	N
467	467	00:31:16	00:31:19	The, uh, toolbox in your truck, is that new?	N
468	468	00:31:20	00:31:23	Nope. Bought it a couple months ago.	N
469	469	00:31:23	00:31:25	Somebody stole the last one.	Y
470	470	00:31:25	00:31:30	See, we got a big problem with that around here the help walking off with stuff.	N
471	471	00:31:30	00:31:32	Nick, where did you acquire this photo?	N
472	472	00:31:32	00:31:34	Pro Rodeo Association.	N
473	473	00:31:34	00:31:36	That is you.	N
474	474	00:31:36	00:31:37	Yeah.	Y
475	475	00:31:37	00:31:39	Do you remember where this was taken?	Y
476	476	00:31:42	00:31:45	Looks like Bronc Finals, Wichita, Kansas.	N
477	477	00:31:45	00:31:46	Spent a month there training for the finals.	N
478	478	00:31:47	00:31:48	But you leave here normally, right?	Y
479	479	00:31:48	00:31:49	Mm-hmm.	Y
480	480	00:31:49	00:31:53	What month, exactly?	Y
481	481	00:31:56	00:31:58	This photo here...	N
482	482	00:31:58	00:32:01	uh, March, 2000.	N
483	483	00:32:03	00:32:05	19 months ago.	Y
484	484	00:32:05	00:32:17	Your ants put the time of death at 19 months Rattison puts being out of town at 19 months yet Randy Traschel's been missing 17 months so... ( chuckles ) now what?	Y
485	485	00:32:17	00:32:19	We need a more precise timeline.	N
486	486	00:32:19	00:32:21	Yeah... so...	N
487	487	00:32:21	00:32:22	back to the bugs?	N
488	488	00:32:22	00:32:23	On to the rust.	N
489	489	00:32:23	00:32:25	Ah.	N
490	490	00:32:29	00:32:31	Why are you throwing phone books?	N
491	491	00:32:32	00:32:34	'Cause a beaker gets glass all over the place.	N
492	492	00:32:34	00:32:36	What's wrong?	N
493	493	00:32:36	00:32:40	It's this curtain that the porn girl was found wrapped in.	N
494	494	00:32:40	00:32:42	I've got no prints, no second donor.	N
495	495	00:32:42	00:32:45	I've got nothing to link this porn guy to the girl's murder.	N
496	496	00:32:46	00:32:47	It's just driving me nuts.	N
497	497	00:32:48	00:32:49	I'm fine.	N
498	498	00:32:49	00:32:50	I'm sorry. Are you okay?	N
499	499	00:32:50	00:32:52	Yeah. You missed me by a mile.	N
500	500	00:32:52	00:32:53	We may have something.	N
501	501	00:32:53	00:32:54	Really.	N
502	502	00:32:54	00:32:56	Right here. I wanted to show you.	N
503	503	00:32:56	00:33:00	When he's stabbing her she's bleeding all over him.	N
504	504	00:33:00	00:33:03	Well, a void proves that, but we still can't prove it's him.	N
505	505	00:33:03	00:33:04	Yeah, but her blood might.	Y
506	506	00:33:04	00:33:06	Catherine and I suspect transference.	Y
507	507	00:33:06	00:33:08	She had HIV.	Y
508	508	00:33:08	00:33:10	Well, how are we going to get a sample of Sampson's blood?	N
509	509	00:33:10	00:33:13	Warrant, based on the butterscotch dirt that you found on his car.	N
510	510	00:33:13	00:33:15	Oh. I like that.	N
511	511	00:33:15	00:33:18	You might want to apologize to the phone book.	N
512	512	00:33:35	00:33:40	We sliced the shard into layers of 100 microns to measure the level of oxidation.	N
513	513	00:33:40	00:33:45	Moisture from the body hits the carbon steel and then corrosion begins.	N
514	514	00:33:45	00:33:50	And we can be certain that there was moisture right away.	N
515	515	00:33:50	00:33:53	So it's like slicing the mold off of bread.	N
516	516	00:33:53	00:33:54	And measuring it.	N
517	517	00:33:54	00:33:59	The rust penetrated the 13th layer and just barely in the 14th.	N
518	518	00:33:59	00:34:02	Archie, run the weather.	N
519	519	00:34:02	00:34:04	National Weather Service for Las Vegas.	N
520	520	00:34:04	00:34:06	Average relative humidity 30.29.	N
521	521	00:34:06	00:34:12	Temperature 22.61 Celsius.	Y
522	522	00:34:12	00:34:14	So, corrosion versus time...	Y
523	523	00:34:18	00:34:19	March, 2000.	Y
524	524	00:34:19	00:34:22	Spur exposure time was exactly 17 months.	Y
525	525	00:34:22	00:34:24	And we can testify to this.	Y
526	526	00:34:24	00:34:27	Missing persons were right. The ants were off.	Y
527	527	00:34:27	00:34:30	Yeah, so was Rattison.	Y
528	528	00:34:30	00:34:32	He was in town.	Y
529	529	00:35:14	00:35:16	Two feet.	N
530	530	00:35:16	00:35:21	We have reason to believe the wounds that killed Randy Traschel were made by one of your bulls.	N
531	531	00:35:21	00:35:24	That's why we cut the horns, to prevent such.	N
532	532	00:35:24	00:35:27	We're looking for horns with points attached.	N
533	533	00:35:27	00:35:30	Yeah. We need to see your other bulls.	N
534	534	00:35:30	00:35:32	Curly's the only one I got.	N
535	535	00:35:39	00:35:40	What do you all want now?	Y
536	536	00:35:40	00:35:42	We're waiting on you, actually.	Y
537	537	00:35:42	00:35:47	Mr. Rattison, we have reason to believe you were in town the month that Randy Traschel was murdered.	Y
538	538	00:35:47	00:35:50	Could you tell us what used to be here?	N
539	539	00:35:50	00:35:51	My belt buckles.	Y
540	540	00:35:51	00:35:54	Somebody stole it last year, like I said.	Y
541	541	00:35:54	00:35:56	You do get a lot of stuff stolen, don't you?	N
542	542	00:35:56	00:36:00	Mind if we look around your truck?	N
543	543	00:36:01	00:36:03	Sure.	N
544	544	00:36:10	00:36:13	Don't get any tobacco juice on my shoe.	Y
545	545	00:36:29	00:36:33	Got a tape measure?	Y
546	546	00:36:37	00:36:39	18 inches.	N
547	547	00:36:39	00:36:43	Phenolphthalein.	Y
548	548	00:36:55	00:36:57	Positive for blood.	Y
549	549	00:36:57	00:37:02	Looks like the only thing stolen around here was Randy Traschel's life.	N
550	550	00:37:17	00:37:20	What you laughing at, huh?	N
551	551	00:37:20	00:37:22	You want to come over here and try it?	N
552	552	00:38:01	00:38:08	By the way the definition of the word retard is to hinder or to hold someone back.	Y
553	553	00:38:08	00:38:12	I think your life is about to become retarded.	Y
554	554	00:38:20	00:38:24	You have never had sexual intercourse with Susan Hodap?	Y
555	555	00:38:24	00:38:26	I told you, I've never even met her.	Y
556	556	00:38:26	00:38:28	I know, but I got to ask.	Y
557	557	00:38:28	00:38:30	You've never had sex with her?	Y
558	558	00:38:30	00:38:31	Not ever.	N
559	559	00:38:43	00:38:46	You still have those chills, Mr. Sampson?	N
560	560	00:38:46	00:38:47	Feeling hot, achy?	N
561	561	00:38:48	00:38:50	Back of your throat scratchy?	N
562	562	00:38:50	00:38:52	Yeah, it is.	Y
563	563	00:38:53	00:38:54	Original flu.	N
564	564	00:38:54	00:38:57	Happens at the onset of HIV.	Y
565	565	00:38:57	00:38:59	Seroconversion.	N
566	566	00:39:00	00:39:04	Usually presents two to six weeks after the exchange of fluids.	Y
567	567	00:39:04	00:39:06	Exchange of fluids?	Y
568	568	00:39:06	00:39:09	That temperature is your body working up a resistance to the virus.	Y
569	569	00:39:10	00:39:13	HIV? Me?	N
570	570	00:39:13	00:39:14	Now, come on.	N
571	571	00:39:14	00:39:16	You just took my blood a few days ago.	N
572	572	00:39:16	00:39:19	A private lab can run a virus test within a day.	N
573	573	00:39:19	00:39:21	CDC doesn't broadcast that.	N
574	574	00:39:21	00:39:23	Tests are very expensive.	N
575	575	00:39:24	00:39:25	We dipped into the budget just for you.	N
576	576	00:39:26	00:39:28	You're playing me. I don't have HIV.	N
577	577	00:39:28	00:39:29	Susan Hodap had it.	N
578	578	00:39:29	00:39:31	The exact same strain that you have.	N
579	579	00:39:31	00:39:38	We had that lab do what's called a phylogenetic analysis of your HIV's DNA and Susan's.	N
580	580	00:39:38	00:39:41	As you can see, the genes are identical.	N
581	581	00:39:41	00:39:44	Which means Susan gave it directly to you.	N
582	582	00:39:44	00:39:45	But we never had sex.	N
583	583	00:39:45	00:39:46	You did stab her, though.	N
584	584	00:39:48	00:39:49	And at that moment...	N
585	585	00:39:49	00:39:55	her arterial blood hit your eyes entering your body through the conjunctival membrane.	N
586	586	00:39:55	00:40:01	Non-sexual transmission is extremely difficult but obviously it's possible.	N
587	587	00:40:01	00:40:04	Susan's blood was absorbed into your bloodstream.	N
588	588	00:40:04	00:40:10	Where the new HIV cells immediately started attaching to your healthy white blood cells.	N
589	589	00:40:10	00:40:14	Gets inside one, replicates about 2,000 times.	N
590	590	00:40:14	00:40:18	Disables the host cell, pinches back out infecting more good cells...	N
591	591	00:40:20	00:40:28	lowering your immune system until your body loses its ability to fight off even the simplest invader.	N
592	592	00:40:28	00:40:33	Of course, the strains will have changed by then and you and Susan Hodap will have a different strain of HIV.	N
593	593	00:40:33	00:40:38	The sooner you see a doctor the better your chances for longevity.	N
594	594	00:40:38	00:40:42	But for now, we got you.	N
595	595	00:40:43	00:40:45	You killed her.	N
596	596	00:40:48	00:40:50	I guess she killed you back.	N
