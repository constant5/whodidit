0	00:00:13	00:00:14	Good afternoon, Mr. McGrath.
1	00:00:14	00:00:15	How’s the golf?
2	00:00:20	00:00:22	Hi.
3	00:00:22	00:00:23	You look lost.
4	00:00:23	00:00:28	Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the real estate office is at the end of the hall.
5	00:00:28	00:00:30	Okay? Bye.
6	00:00:30	00:00:32	Ooh, are those for me?
7	00:00:32	00:00:33	Hi, Dominic, sign here.
8	00:00:33	00:00:34	Okay.
9	00:00:34	00:00:37	I tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday.
10	00:00:37	00:00:39	I know, Elvis.
11	00:00:39	00:00:40	Okay.
12	00:00:40	00:00:41	See you. Okay, bye-bye.
13	00:00:42	00:00:44	Domino, it’s your turn to pick up dinner.
14	00:00:44	00:00:45	Okay, Jake-o.
15	00:00:45	00:00:47	Listen, uh, this goes to Cooley Real Estate.
16	00:00:47	00:00:48	That’s on two, all right?
17	00:00:48	00:00:51	And the Fed Ex is running a little bit late on the pick-up.
18	00:00:51	00:00:52	I’ll be back in...
19	00:00:52	00:00:54	hmm, about ten minutes, all right?
20	00:00:54	00:00:55	You got it. All right, buddy.
21	00:01:34	00:01:38	Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.
22	00:01:38	00:01:39	That’s what they do.
23	00:01:39	00:01:42	Put wet stuff on the red stuff.
24	00:01:42	00:01:45	We’re all clear to go in, but here’s what we’ve got.
25	00:01:45	00:01:46	Couple of head wounds.
26	00:01:46	00:01:48	Elderly guy had his arm torn off.
27	00:01:48	00:01:50	The only fatality so far is Jake Richards, a security guard.
28	00:01:50	00:01:53	Body’s still inside.
29	00:02:02	00:02:03	How big you think this bomb was?
30	00:02:03	00:02:05	It’s not the size of the bomb.
31	00:02:05	00:02:08	It’s the overpressure in the air around it.
32	00:02:25	00:02:27	The Van Gogh effect.
33	00:02:28	00:02:29	In stereo.
34	00:02:29	00:02:31	Both ears gone.
35	00:02:31	00:02:33	A perfectly symmetrical amputation.
36	00:02:33	00:02:36	Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.
37	00:02:36	00:02:41	So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.
38	00:02:43	00:02:45	Smell the sulfur?
39	00:02:45	00:02:47	Uh-huh.
40	00:02:50	00:02:51	Got your lighter, Jim?
41	00:02:51	00:02:53	Sure.
42	00:02:58	00:02:59	Light this.
43	00:03:02	00:03:04	Gunpowder.
44	00:03:04	00:03:06	Well, we know the propellant.
45	00:03:06	00:03:09	So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?
46	00:03:09	00:03:10	I’d love to.
47	00:03:12	00:03:14	Seat of the bomb is here.
48	00:03:14	00:03:17	Victim was thrown...
49	00:03:17	00:03:19	three meters.
50	00:03:19	00:03:24	His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant.
51	00:03:24	00:03:25	6,000-7,000 feet per second.
52	00:03:25	00:03:28	Who? Why?
53	00:03:28	00:03:31	Will he do it again?
54	00:03:31	00:03:33	Time will tell.
55	00:04:14	00:04:20	The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use.
56	00:04:20	00:04:24	Our murder weapon’s here someplace in a thousand pieces.
57	00:04:24	00:04:26	We have to find it and put it back together again.
58	00:04:26	00:04:27	Where do we start?
59	00:04:27	00:04:29	If it’s not growing pick it up.
60	00:04:29	00:04:32	We cart everything we find back to the lab. And then what?
61	00:04:32	00:04:35	Stay curious.
62	00:04:36	00:04:38	Can you fill in the blanks?
63	00:04:38	00:04:39	Bombs explode.
64	00:04:39	00:04:42	Weird thing is their components survive the explosion.
65	00:04:42	00:04:45	If we can piece together this bomb we’re closer to finding who did this.
66	00:04:45	00:04:49	So, Warrick, when you’re photographing this debris can you, uh...?
67	00:04:49	00:04:52	Uh, I know, looky-loos.
68	00:05:38	00:05:41	Come on, Nick, it’s my last night in Sin City.
69	00:05:41	00:05:42	One more drink, man.
70	00:05:42	00:05:43	Oh, no, I just pulled a double.
71	00:05:43	00:05:45	And I still have to file my shift report.
72	00:05:45	00:05:47	Man, you’re off the clock.
73	00:05:47	00:05:50	You’d have never passed up a wild night back at A&amp;M.
74	00:05:50	00:05:52	Well, I guess I grew up.
75	00:05:52	00:05:53	Too bad, check that out.
76	00:06:00	00:06:01	Enjoy.
77	00:06:01	00:06:03	You must really love your job, man.
78	00:06:05	00:06:06	Ladies...
79	00:06:14	00:06:16	Here you go. Thanks, man.
80	00:06:16	00:06:17	Get your hands off me!
81	00:06:17	00:06:19	Kristy, you’re not going anywhere.
82	00:06:19	00:06:21	You got that?
83	00:06:21	00:06:23	Come on. Relax a little bit.
84	00:06:23	00:06:24	Settle down.
85	00:06:24	00:06:26	Kristy? Kristy! You don’t own me, Jack.
86	00:06:26	00:06:27	Nobody does.
87	00:06:27	00:06:28	Hey.
88	00:06:28	00:06:29	Back off.
89	00:06:29	00:06:30	Hey, just mind your own business. Nick.
90	00:06:30	00:06:32	I know him. He’s a cop.
91	00:06:32	00:06:34	A crime scene investigator.
92	00:06:34	00:06:36	Nick, tell him to leave me alone.
93	00:06:36	00:06:39	Nobody tells me to do anything...
94	00:06:39	00:06:40	Hey, are we going to have a problem?
95	00:06:40	00:06:45	No, officer, we’re not going to have a problem.
96	00:06:45	00:06:46	I’ll see you around, baby.
97	00:06:55	00:06:57	You okay?
98	00:06:57	00:06:58	Yeah.
99	00:06:58	00:07:00	Yeah, I’m fine.
100	00:07:00	00:07:02	That was good timing. Thanks.
101	00:07:02	00:07:05	I suppose you need a ride.
102	00:07:05	00:07:07	Do you mind?
103	00:07:07	00:07:09	No.
104	00:07:09	00:07:11	Come on.
105	00:07:11	00:07:12	Thanks.
106	00:07:14	00:07:18	Seems like every time we run into each other I’m getting into trouble.
107	00:07:18	00:07:22	Not that it’s any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.
108	00:07:22	00:07:25	Not every john is like that guy.
109	00:07:25	00:07:28	Besides, I’m making a change.
110	00:07:28	00:07:30	I’m going back to school.
111	00:07:30	00:07:32	Yeah?
112	00:07:32	00:07:34	I’ve always wanted to study communications.
113	00:07:34	00:07:35	I’m good with people.
114	00:07:35	00:07:38	That’s good.
115	00:07:38	00:07:40	You think so?
116	00:07:40	00:07:42	Yeah, I do.
117	00:07:42	00:07:45	Well, I’m going to go inside now.
118	00:07:47	00:07:52	Unless, of course, you’d like to come in for a drink.
119	00:07:52	00:07:55	I don’t think that’d be a good idea.
120	00:07:55	00:07:56	Come on.
121	00:07:56	00:08:00	Just ’cause you’re a crime scene analyst you don’t have to analyze everything.
122	00:08:25	00:08:27	FP.
123	00:08:33	00:08:36	Mr. Grissom.
124	00:08:39	00:08:40	Oh, uh...
125	00:08:40	00:08:42	Hi, I’ve...
126	00:08:42	00:08:44	I’ve, um, I’ve seen you on TV before.
127	00:08:44	00:08:46	I admire your work.
128	00:08:46	00:08:47	Well, thank you.
129	00:08:47	00:08:48	And your name is...?
130	00:08:48	00:08:49	Dominic.
131	00:08:49	00:08:53	Uh, i-c rather than with the i-c-k... uh, Kretzker.
132	00:08:53	00:08:56	I’m the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail.
133	00:08:56	00:08:58	Did somebody from Homicide talk to you yet?
134	00:08:58	00:09:01	Yeah, as a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you.
135	00:09:01	00:09:02	Because, well, we are...
136	00:09:02	00:09:04	you know, we’re both in law enforcement, and...
137	00:09:04	00:09:06	Right.
138	00:09:06	00:09:09	Did you know the victim-- the other security guard?
139	00:09:09	00:09:11	Oh, yeah, he was one of my best buddies.
140	00:09:11	00:09:16	As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes’ difference it would’ve been my face all over the news instead of his, right?
141	00:09:16	00:09:19	Would you, uh, like to be on the news?
142	00:09:19	00:09:19	Yeah.
143	00:09:19	00:09:21	Yeah.
144	00:09:21	00:09:23	I mean... only if I could help people, yes.
145	00:09:23	00:09:24	No, no.
146	00:09:24	00:09:26	I know what you’re thinking.
147	00:09:26	00:09:30	Uh, you know, my building blows up I’m over at Arby’s sucking down some extra sauce.
148	00:09:30	00:09:32	You know, how could I want to help people, right?
149	00:09:32	00:09:34	Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?
150	00:09:34	00:09:36	Well, I know a lot about bombs.
151	00:09:36	00:09:38	You know, pipe, power, powder.
152	00:09:38	00:09:41	The three Ps of mass destruction.
153	00:09:41	00:09:42	Huh.
154	00:09:42	00:09:44	Dominic...
155	00:09:44	00:09:45	with an i-c, not i-c-k... Yes sir?
156	00:09:45	00:09:48	Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?
157	00:09:48	00:09:51	Are you serious?
158	00:09:52	00:09:54	Yeah, yes, sir.
159	00:09:54	00:09:56	I’ll be honored, sir.
160	00:09:56	00:09:58	Oh.
161	00:09:58	00:10:02	But we can’t tell anybody on the day shift, though because they’re going to get real jealous.
162	00:10:02	00:10:04	That’s good thinking.
163	00:10:04	00:10:06	Would you excuse me a minute?
164	00:10:06	00:10:08	Yes.
165	00:10:10	00:10:12	Keep an eye on that guy.
166	00:10:13	00:10:15	Oh, yes!
167	00:10:15	00:10:18	Well, we got a live one out there.
168	00:10:18	00:10:20	I got a cop babysitting him.
169	00:10:20	00:10:22	How are you doing?
170	00:10:22	00:10:25	Well, are his initials FP?
171	00:10:25	00:10:29	No, Dominic Kretzker, why?
172	00:10:29	00:10:32	I found this near the point of origin.
173	00:10:33	00:10:37	Whoever did this is playing with us.
174	00:10:37	00:10:39	Or he wants to get caught.
175	00:10:45	00:10:47	Hey, it’s me.
176	00:10:47	00:10:48	You in the shower? What are you doing?
177	00:10:48	00:10:52	Anyway, if you check your messages I don’t have to work till later.
178	00:10:52	00:10:56	So I thought since you’re between careers you might want to grab a late...
179	00:10:56	00:10:58	breakfast.
180	00:11:02	00:11:04	Hey, Nick, what’s up?
181	00:11:04	00:11:06	Not a lot. What’s... what’s going on?
182	00:11:06	00:11:07	It’s a 4-19.
183	00:11:07	00:11:09	Dead prostitute.
184	00:11:09	00:11:12	Who’s the decedent?
185	00:11:12	00:11:14	Kristine Marie Hopkins.
186	00:11:14	00:11:16	Day shift’s got it covered.
187	00:11:18	00:11:19	You all right?
188	00:11:19	00:11:20	Yeah, I must’ve, uh...
189	00:11:20	00:11:21	I must’ve got my wires crossed.
190	00:11:21	00:11:22	I’ll see you.
191	00:11:22	00:11:24	All right, man.
192	00:11:27	00:11:31	All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right?
193	00:11:31	00:11:33	Then you cap it here, and you cap it here.
194	00:11:33	00:11:36	Now, the grains inside, all right...
195	00:11:36	00:11:39	they’re going to ignite and they’re gonna cause smoke.
196	00:11:39	00:11:41	Lots and lots of smoke.
197	00:11:41	00:11:44	Now, the problem is is all this smoke here, man, it’s got nowhere to go.
198	00:11:44	00:11:47	Okay, it starts cooking, and then...
199	00:11:47	00:11:49	Bob’s your uncle... Boom!
200	00:11:49	00:11:52	you do know a lot about bombs.
201	00:11:52	00:11:53	How’d you learn so much?
202	00:11:53	00:11:55	Oh, they don’t teach this stuff at universities.
203	00:11:55	00:11:56	You know, this is all trial and error.
204	00:11:56	00:12:00	So what, you just, uh, blow up bombs and study them?
205	00:12:00	00:12:01	Yeah. Yeah...
206	00:12:02	00:12:04	Margaret Finn, Public Defender.
207	00:12:04	00:12:06	Cease and desist any conversation with my client.
208	00:12:06	00:12:08	I’ve been assigned to you.
209	00:12:08	00:12:12	Guess the PD was thinking of all the lawsuits Richard Jewell brought when he was wrongfully accused.
210	00:12:12	00:12:15	Someone died in that office building.
211	00:12:15	00:12:19	Ma’am, you seem like a very nice person but these people--they’ve been very, very good to me.
212	00:12:19	00:12:21	I’m sure they have.
213	00:12:21	00:12:24	Dominic, I think you should roll with your attorney.
214	00:12:24	00:12:26	Thanks for your help, though.
215	00:12:26	00:12:27	All right.
216	00:12:27	00:12:28	I’ll see you guys later.
217	00:12:28	00:12:29	Listen, do me a favor.
218	00:12:29	00:12:33	Will you tell Grissom that if he needs me just call me at home, okay? All right.
219	00:12:33	00:12:34	Let’s roll.
220	00:12:36	00:12:40	So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin?
221	00:12:40	00:12:41	Yep.
222	00:12:41	00:12:44	How could the victim possibly have been in one piece?
223	00:12:44	00:12:46	Vacuum effect.
224	00:12:46	00:12:49	The air is being pushed out so fast...
225	00:12:49	00:12:52	and the bomb detonates...
226	00:12:52	00:12:54	there’s a calm at the center...
227	00:12:58	00:13:02	Calm, huh? Well, except for when he lost his ears.
228	00:13:02	00:13:04	Did you figure out what this FP stands for?
229	00:13:04	00:13:07	I ran it through ATF’s bomb database.
230	00:13:07	00:13:09	No profile.
231	00:13:09	00:13:11	So our bomber’s a newbie.
232	00:13:11	00:13:13	Does he fit Grissom’s wack job from the bomb site?
233	00:13:13	00:13:15	Dominic the security guard?
234	00:13:15	00:13:17	Ah, it’s too soon to tell.
235	00:13:17	00:13:19	I found something interesting.
236	00:13:19	00:13:21	What is it?
237	00:13:23	00:13:25	Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.
238	00:13:25	00:13:26	Bomb was time-delayed.
239	00:13:26	00:13:28	This is a piece of the timing device.
240	00:13:28	00:13:30	What about the orange stuff?
241	00:13:30	00:13:34	Heat of the explosion must’ve melted whatever it is all around the wheel.
242	00:13:34	00:13:36	So Sara?
243	00:13:36	00:13:39	So what’s orange and melts?
244	00:13:39	00:13:41	I would have to investigate that.
245	00:13:41	00:13:42	Thank you.
246	00:13:42	00:13:44	Hey, guys.
247	00:13:44	00:13:45	Can I steal you for a minute?
248	00:13:45	00:13:46	I thought this was your day off.
249	00:13:46	00:13:47	We’re kind of busy here, Nick.
250	00:13:47	00:13:50	Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry, but I don’t think this can wait.
251	00:13:50	00:13:52	Okay.
252	00:13:56	00:13:59	You told me you weren’t dating her.
253	00:13:59	00:14:04	I wasn’t till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh... Jack.
254	00:14:04	00:14:07	And Ecklie’s at her house now.
255	00:14:07	00:14:09	Yeah, and I can tell you what he’s going to find.
256	00:14:09	00:14:12	My fingerprints, my DNA.
257	00:14:12	00:14:14	What were you thinking, Nicky?
258	00:14:14	00:14:17	I wasn’t.
259	00:14:17	00:14:21	We had a connection, you know?
260	00:14:21	00:14:24	Chemistry thing, I guess.
261	00:14:24	00:14:27	She was irresistible, man.
262	00:14:27	00:14:30	00.
263	00:14:30	00:14:31	Ecklie’s going to be all over this.
264	00:14:32	00:14:35	Hey, Nick...
265	00:14:35	00:14:37	I’m sorry to hear about your friend.
266	00:14:37	00:14:39	Who told you?
267	00:14:39	00:14:40	Word travels.
268	00:14:40	00:14:42	It was the day shift coroner.
269	00:14:42	00:14:44	So people know I was with Kristy last night?
270	00:14:44	00:14:46	Not yet.
271	00:14:46	00:14:49	Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there.
272	00:14:49	00:14:53	When you’re a suspect and you’re innocent, you keep your mouth shut.
273	00:14:54	00:14:56	I’ll talk to Ecklie.
274	00:14:56	00:14:57	Bad idea. You and Ecklie...
275	00:14:57	00:14:58	oil and water.
276	00:14:58	00:15:00	Just let me get into it.
277	00:15:00	00:15:02	I can’t just sit here.
278	00:15:02	00:15:04	Okay, go for a walk.
279	00:15:04	00:15:07	Maybe you’ll accidentally bump into your guy, Jack?
280	00:15:07	00:15:09	Yeah.
281	00:15:09	00:15:12	I.D. him, but don’t approach him.
282	00:15:12	00:15:14	Okay.
283	00:15:19	00:15:23	If Nick’s arrested it’s not going to matter that he’s cleared later.
284	00:15:23	00:15:25	No, it’s an automatic dismissal.
285	00:15:30	00:15:33	25-year-old female Caucasian.
286	00:15:33	00:15:38	Liver temp’s indicating time of death at 0600.
287	00:15:38	00:15:42	Petichial hemorrhaging, cyanotic tongue.
288	00:15:44	00:15:45	Can I help you, Catherine?
289	00:15:45	00:15:46	I just want to see the body, David.
290	00:15:46	00:15:48	Unless I’m mistaken, this is Ecklie’s case.
291	00:15:48	00:15:50	Eyes, no hands.
292	00:15:52	00:15:54	Look at those ligature marks.
293	00:15:54	00:15:56	Petichials...
294	00:15:56	00:15:57	blue tongue, the works.
295	00:15:57	00:16:00	Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck.
296	00:16:00	00:16:02	She didn’t give up easy.
297	00:16:02	00:16:04	Struggled and strangled.
298	00:16:04	00:16:06	Ecklie find the murder weapon?
299	00:16:06	00:16:08	I only deal with bodies.
300	00:16:08	00:16:10	Did you check for fingerprints on the body?
301	00:16:10	00:16:14	Not yet. Half-life of fingerprints on flesh they’re disappearing as we speak.
302	00:16:14	00:16:15	Catherine, I like Nick, too.
303	00:16:15	00:16:17	I know you’re here for him.
304	00:16:17	00:16:19	But what if I lift his prints from her?
305	00:16:19	00:16:21	Then that’s what you report.
306	00:16:21	00:16:25	Evidence, Doc... all we got.
307	00:16:35	00:16:36	Hey.
308	00:16:36	00:16:38	Could you find that and turn it off, please?
309	00:16:46	00:16:48	Find the clock our guy used?
310	00:16:48	00:16:49	Not yet.
311	00:16:49	00:16:50	This is a good choice.
312	00:16:50	00:17:08	According to the Bomb Data Center which has a record of every component used in any bomb-- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks-- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell Snoozewell, $10.99 at any local drugstore.
313	00:17:08	00:17:10	You’ve spoiled all my fun.
314	00:17:11	00:17:13	Gris, can I get clear on something here?
315	00:17:13	00:17:14	Anything’s possible.
316	00:17:14	00:17:21	Catherine gave me this FP which was part of the Hansen bomb and I’m supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it.
317	00:17:21	00:17:23	You isolate the tool, and then we trace it.
318	00:17:23	00:17:27	Yeah, but he could’ve used any number of things to initial it.
319	00:17:27	00:17:29	I mean, a screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter.
320	00:17:29	00:17:30	It’s the same as guns...
321	00:17:30	00:17:33	we eliminate them one at a time.
322	00:17:33	00:17:34	What are you guys doing?
323	00:17:34	00:17:37	We’re going to go blow up some bombs.
324	00:17:37	00:17:41	Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation.
325	00:17:41	00:17:44	Alas. Poor Warrick.
326	00:18:20	00:18:23	Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom’s in the field.
327	00:18:23	00:18:25	I need to speak with him.
328	00:18:25	00:18:27	And I need to speak with you...
329	00:18:27	00:18:28	about Nick Stokes.
330	00:18:28	00:18:29	Well, let me guess...
331	00:18:29	00:18:31	about his involvement with a dead hooker?
332	00:18:31	00:18:34	Come on. The hooker was a person.
333	00:18:34	00:18:35	Her name was Kristy Hopkins.
334	00:18:35	00:18:36	I realize that. Thank you.
335	00:18:36	00:18:38	I just came from the lab.
336	00:18:38	00:18:40	His prints were all over Kristy Hopkins’ house.
337	00:18:40	00:18:43	Let’s see, wine glass...
338	00:18:43	00:18:44	oh, bedside table.
339	00:18:44	00:18:46	How’s it going, Cath?
340	00:18:46	00:18:49	Nick, I don’t think that you guys should be talking.
341	00:18:49	00:18:51	It’s no big deal.
342	00:18:51	00:18:52	What’s up, Ecklie?
343	00:18:52	00:18:55	I need a DNA sample from you, Nick.
344	00:18:55	00:18:59	I assume you’re trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night.
345	00:18:59	00:19:01	We found a condom, used.
346	00:19:01	00:19:04	And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary.
347	00:19:04	00:19:06	And I have something else for you.
348	00:19:08	00:19:10	I got this off a valet surveillance tape.
349	00:19:10	00:19:12	A license plate number?
350	00:19:12	00:19:14	Vehicle belongs to Jack Willman.
351	00:19:14	00:19:17	Had a fight with Kristy Hopkins outside the Orpheus last night around midnight.
352	00:19:17	00:19:23	Well, I’ll look into it but come on, your fingerprints, your DNA that’s what’s going into evidence.
353	00:19:23	00:19:25	You just love that, don’t you?
354	00:19:25	00:19:27	You think I want to believe that a CSI could commit murder?
355	00:19:27	00:19:30	Hell, I don’t even want to believe that a CSI could sleep with a hooker.
356	00:19:30	00:19:31	You know what? Nick’s private life...
357	00:19:31	00:19:32	Is no longer private.
358	00:19:32	00:19:36	Catherine, I’m sorry if you guys don’t like where the evidence is pointing.
359	00:19:36	00:19:38	But show me otherwise, tell me I’m wrong.
360	00:19:38	00:19:40	In the meantime, my hands are tied.
361	00:19:40	00:19:42	I have protocol to follow.
362	00:19:46	00:19:47	I hate that guy.
363	00:19:47	00:19:50	Okay, look, I’m going to get O’Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning.
364	00:19:50	00:19:52	But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick.
365	00:19:52	00:19:54	Just don’t make it harder with Ecklie, okay?
366	00:19:54	00:19:55	Yeah.
367	00:19:57	00:19:59	We find the bomber by understanding the bomb.
368	00:19:59	00:20:02	Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container.
369	00:20:02	00:20:04	Aluminum briefcase.
370	00:20:04	00:20:05	And we know the timing device.
371	00:20:05	00:20:06	Snoozewell.
372	00:20:06	00:20:07	And the propellant.
373	00:20:07	00:20:08	Black gunpowder.
374	00:20:08	00:20:10	So the final piece of the bomber’s signature?
375	00:20:10	00:20:12	Identify the pipe containing the powder.
376	00:20:12	00:20:16	Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes.
377	00:20:16	00:20:20	Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied.
378	00:20:20	00:20:22	Number one is a plumber’s ex-flow pipe.
379	00:20:22	00:20:24	Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner.
380	00:20:24	00:20:28	Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.
381	00:20:35	00:20:36	You ready?
382	00:20:38	00:20:40	Let’s do it, Dan.
383	00:20:47	00:20:48	Green.
384	00:20:48	00:20:49	That’s the ex-flow pipe.
385	00:20:51	00:20:54	Inflow pipe, blue.
386	00:20:59	00:21:02	Red, the galvanized steel.
387	00:21:14	00:21:17	ten feet.
388	00:21:32	00:21:36	16 feet.
389	00:21:45	00:21:48	20 feet.
390	00:21:55	00:21:59	Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.
391	00:21:59	00:22:03	20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.
392	00:22:03	00:22:06	That’s the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.
393	00:22:06	00:22:11	So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel.
394	00:22:11	00:22:14	Like a muffler or a tailpipe.
395	00:22:14	00:22:16	I’ve seen it before.
396	00:22:16	00:22:17	It’s a common container for homemades.
397	00:22:17	00:22:20	Don’t you love the smell of sulfur in the afternoon?
398	00:22:20	00:22:23	You might want to go and take a tour of Dominic Kretzker’s house.
399	00:22:23	00:22:25	I tracked down the sale of Snoozewell clocks.
400	00:22:25	00:22:29	926 credit card purchases in the last three months in Clark County.
401	00:22:29	00:22:32	Seven to Dominic Kretzker of Prairie Road.
402	00:22:59	00:23:01	Hey, hey. That your scanner?
403	00:23:01	00:23:04	Yeah, that’s how I knew you were coming.
404	00:23:04	00:23:06	Makes me feel like I’m part of things.
405	00:23:06	00:23:08	Mr. Grissom.
406	00:23:08	00:23:10	What can I do for you guys?
407	00:23:10	00:23:15	Dominic... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb.
408	00:23:15	00:23:19	We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock.
409	00:23:19	00:23:22	Yeah, yeah, I recognize that.
410	00:23:22	00:23:24	That houses a nice little detonator.
411	00:23:24	00:23:27	Want to show us that clock of yours?
412	00:23:27	00:23:29	Oh, sure. Come on in.
413	00:23:32	00:23:34	The place is kind of a mess. Sorry.
414	00:23:34	00:23:35	Here.
415	00:23:35	00:23:38	Here it is.
416	00:23:39	00:23:41	TimeTell Snoozewell.
417	00:23:41	00:23:43	$10.99.
418	00:23:43	00:23:46	Well, you can get it for half price if you’ve got a coupon.
419	00:23:46	00:23:48	The timing device is still intact.
420	00:23:48	00:23:50	Yeah, ’cause I haven’t made the bomb yet.
421	00:23:50	00:23:53	But you have made bombs before, using parts from this make?
422	00:23:53	00:23:54	Well, yeah.
423	00:23:54	00:23:57	Yeah, I blow them out in back all the time.
424	00:23:57	00:23:59	I blasted a few of them a couple months ago.
425	00:23:59	00:24:02	Hey, look what I found.
426	00:24:02	00:24:02	Sulfur.
427	00:24:02	00:24:05	You blow up any bombs recently?
428	00:24:10	00:24:11	Is this from the Hansen bomb?
429	00:24:11	00:24:13	Sure is.
430	00:24:13	00:24:15	You’re keeping a key piece of evidence that could nail you?
431	00:24:15	00:24:17	Hey, that’s sentimental.
432	00:24:17	00:24:19	Well, that’s cute.
433	00:24:19	00:24:20	No, I mean, it is.
434	00:24:20	00:24:23	That’s like, you know, Waco and Trade Center.
435	00:24:23	00:24:25	I mean, that’s historical.
436	00:24:25	00:24:27	I didn’t have a war, all right?
437	00:24:27	00:24:28	I’m too flatfooted for the P.D.
438	00:24:28	00:24:30	and that’s as close to history as I’m going to get.
439	00:24:30	00:24:31	I collect souvenirs.
440	00:24:31	00:24:33	I mean, th-that’s my building, you know.
441	00:24:33	00:24:37	I mean... that was my place of employment, man.
442	00:24:37	00:24:40	You’re going to be sorry, talking to my client.
443	00:24:40	00:24:41	We called you. We left word.
444	00:24:41	00:24:43	Dominic, don’t speak.
445	00:24:43	00:24:45	If I had anything to hide, I’d hide it.
446	00:24:45	00:24:48	I’m pretty proud of that container piece, I’ll tell you.
447	00:24:48	00:24:51	Well, maybe so but you’re under arrest.
448	00:24:51	00:24:53	Put him in the car.
449	00:24:53	00:24:55	You-you kidding?
450	00:24:56	00:24:57	Oh.
451	00:24:59	00:25:00	( siren approaching ) Cuffs?
452	00:25:00	00:25:04	Those vultures never sleep, huh?
453	00:25:06	00:25:08	Could you do me a favor?
454	00:25:08	00:25:10	Can you put the jacket over them?
455	00:25:10	00:25:12	I don’t want to be seen like this.
456	00:25:12	00:25:13	Not on TV.
457	00:25:13	00:25:15	This is not who I am.
458	00:25:18	00:25:20	Thanks, partner.
459	00:25:23	00:25:29	I can’t tell whether he’s brilliant or... nuts.
460	00:25:29	00:25:30	Sound familiar?
461	00:25:30	00:25:34	Tell you one thing if he’s guilty he’s putting on one hell of a show.
462	00:26:10	00:26:13	Polyethylene? Terephtalete?
463	00:26:21	00:26:23	You contact her family?
464	00:26:23	00:26:25	No family to speak of.
465	00:26:25	00:26:27	Has anyone claimed her?
466	00:26:27	00:26:29	For burial? Friend, old roommate?
467	00:26:29	00:26:30	There’s no one.
468	00:26:30	00:26:31	City’ll be footing the bill.
469	00:26:35	00:26:37	No, I’ll pay.
470	00:26:37	00:26:39	Sure that’s prudent given the circumstances?
471	00:26:39	00:26:43	Doc, I’m giving this girl a proper burial.
472	00:26:44	00:26:46	I don’t much care about my career right now.
473	00:26:46	00:26:49	Someone wants to throw me in jail for that so be it.
474	00:26:56	00:27:01	How you doing? Just kind of using the current experience to understand the other side of law enforcement.
475	00:27:01	00:27:03	That’s resourceful.
476	00:27:03	00:27:06	You think I’m guilty, don’t you?
477	00:27:06	00:27:11	I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement.
478	00:27:11	00:27:12	That is crazy.
479	00:27:12	00:27:13	I mean, come on.
480	00:27:13	00:27:15	I’m one of the good guys.
481	00:27:15	00:27:17	The cops went through my things.
482	00:27:17	00:27:18	They find anything?
483	00:27:18	00:27:19	Dominic, you have an attorney now.
484	00:27:19	00:27:21	I can’t really talk to you about the case.
485	00:27:21	00:27:26	I was here on another matter and I thought I’d come by.
486	00:27:26	00:27:27	You do what I do.
487	00:27:27	00:27:28	Excuse me?
488	00:27:28	00:27:35	You don’t just like, stop by to see someone, you... make up excuse like I’m in the area, just stopping by.
489	00:27:35	00:27:38	Wow, you’re just like me.
490	00:27:38	00:27:41	Except better-looking.
491	00:27:41	00:27:44	I’ll come by and see you later, okay?
492	00:27:44	00:27:45	Okay.
493	00:27:51	00:27:53	What? Bad news.
494	00:27:53	00:27:54	Another Fourth of July.
495	00:27:54	00:27:57	Where? Thrift-Right Car Rental on Flamingo.
496	00:27:57	00:27:58	Ten minutes ago.
497	00:28:08	00:28:12	So, the manager was working the lot when he heard the blast.
498	00:28:12	00:28:17	Fatality was on the check-in line and died on the way to the hospital.
499	00:28:17	00:28:19	Anybody report hearing a noise? Ticking?
500	00:28:19	00:28:20	No, no one heard anything.
501	00:28:20	00:28:24	Ah, it’s not the firemen it’s the rain. This crime scene is trashed.
502	00:28:30	00:28:32	What do you have?
503	00:28:32	00:28:34	Form follows function.
504	00:28:34	00:28:36	They’ve never been able to make a better one.
505	00:28:36	00:28:38	Mousetrap.
506	00:28:38	00:28:40	That orange stuff again.
507	00:28:40	00:28:45	Someone picks it up, motion trips the trap, sets off the timer.
508	00:28:45	00:28:48	Which sets off the bomb.
509	00:28:53	00:28:56	Be right back.
510	00:28:56	00:28:57	We say nothing to the media or anybody.
511	00:28:57	00:29:00	Our bomber’s signature just got a little more sophisticated.
512	00:29:00	00:29:02	Excuse me.
513	00:29:02	00:29:03	Hi, I’m with the Crime Lab.
514	00:29:03	00:29:06	I’m sorry, but I have to take your jacket.
515	00:29:06	00:29:09	Um... okay.
516	00:29:09	00:29:10	If it’ll help.
517	00:29:10	00:29:12	Thanks.
518	00:29:15	00:29:17	What are you doing?
519	00:29:17	00:29:20	Polyethylene-terephtalete.
520	00:29:20	00:29:21	Polyester.
521	00:29:21	00:29:23	Orange stuff.
522	00:29:25	00:29:28	You’re free to go.
523	00:29:28	00:29:30	I wanted to tell you in person.
524	00:29:30	00:29:32	You mean, you weren’t just in the neighborhood?
525	00:29:32	00:29:35	That second bomb-- it wasn’t remote, was it?
526	00:29:35	00:29:36	Otherwise I’d still be a suspect.
527	00:29:36	00:29:38	I can’t discuss it.
528	00:29:38	00:29:42	So I guess you’re not going to be needing my expertise anymore.
529	00:29:42	00:29:44	I mean, investigation-wise.
530	00:29:44	00:29:47	I knew it was too good to be true.
531	00:29:47	00:29:51	Well, proud to have worked with you, sir.
532	00:29:51	00:29:53	Dominic... I’m not a police officer.
533	00:29:53	00:29:55	I-I-I’m a crime scene analyst.
534	00:29:55	00:29:58	Yeah, but we know who really solves the crimes, don’t we, sir?
535	00:29:58	00:30:01	Good luck.
536	00:30:01	00:30:02	Take care of yourself.
537	00:30:02	00:30:03	Thank you.
538	00:30:06	00:30:08	Hey, Dom?
539	00:30:08	00:30:13	Yeah? Next time try not to be quite so trusting.
540	00:30:13	00:30:15	You don’t need to be a hero.
541	00:30:24	00:30:26	I ran priors.
542	00:30:26	00:30:30	The guy’s got an ’88 conviction for sexual assault.
543	00:30:30	00:30:33	Boy, if I ever get in trouble, I know which CSI I’m going to.
544	00:30:35	00:30:38	Let’s watch the show.
545	00:30:44	00:30:48	How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins?
546	00:30:48	00:30:50	Oh, sir, we can just cut the crap.
547	00:30:50	00:30:52	I saw him kill Kristy.
548	00:30:52	00:30:54	I saw everything.
549	00:30:54	00:30:55	Go on.
550	00:30:55	00:30:58	Well, Kristy and I, we had words.
551	00:30:58	00:31:02	I was swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry but, uh...
552	00:31:04	00:31:07	I didn’t expect to see her with a guy.
553	00:31:07	00:31:08	They were fighting.
554	00:31:08	00:31:12	I couldn’t make out what they were saying but he was pushing her around pretty hard.
555	00:31:14	00:31:16	Could you I.D. this guy? Yeah.
556	00:31:16	00:31:18	It was like, Nick something.
557	00:31:18	00:31:22	Kristy and I bumped into him at The Orpheus earlier.
558	00:31:22	00:31:23	And you saw him kill her?
559	00:31:23	00:31:27	Well, I saw him get violent, but then I took off.
560	00:31:27	00:31:29	And you didn’t try to help the girl?
561	00:31:29	00:31:31	He’s one of you guys.
562	00:31:31	00:31:33	He carries a gun.
563	00:31:33	00:31:35	I’m no hero.
564	00:31:39	00:31:41	So can I go?
565	00:31:43	00:31:46	Yeah.
566	00:31:47	00:31:50	The witness sounds believable.
567	00:31:50	00:31:52	It’s a load of crap and you know it.
568	00:31:52	00:31:54	I was listening.
569	00:31:54	00:31:56	He seemed credible to me.
570	00:31:56	00:31:59	Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.
571	00:31:59	00:32:01	So what can you offer me?
572	00:32:01	00:32:04	Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience.
573	00:32:04	00:32:05	He didn’t do this.
574	00:32:05	00:32:10	Ignore the evidence against Stokes it looks like special favors for CSI.
575	00:32:10	00:32:11	Well, I can’t have that.
576	00:32:11	00:32:12	Not and keep my post.
577	00:32:12	00:32:17	So give me 12 hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.
578	00:32:17	00:32:20	12 hours.
579	00:32:20	00:32:26	But then we arrest Mr. Stokes with all the attendant documentation.
580	00:32:40	00:32:42	How you doing, Greg?
581	00:32:42	00:32:43	Same as you.
582	00:32:43	00:32:44	Yeah. Worried about Nick.
583	00:32:44	00:32:47	I need to see his DNA from the crime scene.
584	00:32:47	00:32:48	You have it, right?
585	00:32:48	00:32:50	A sample from the condom, yeah.
586	00:32:50	00:32:52	Popsicled in the freezer.
587	00:32:52	00:32:54	But, uh, it’s not your case.
588	00:32:54	00:32:57	Much as I want to help, no can do.
589	00:32:57	00:32:59	It’s my case for the next 12 hours.
590	00:32:59	00:33:02	Ask the Sheriff.
591	00:33:02	00:33:04	You know, I would never doubt your word.
592	00:33:04	00:33:06	Smart man.
593	00:33:13	00:33:15	Nick’s little soldiers.
594	00:33:15	00:33:17	It’s all you.
595	00:33:17	00:33:20	Thanks, Greg.
596	00:33:20	00:33:24	When did you say this sample was frozen?
597	00:33:24	00:33:25	15 a.m.
598	00:33:25	00:33:26	Why?
599	00:33:26	00:33:30	These guys are all heads, no tails.
600	00:33:30	00:33:33	That’s normal, given the post-ejaculate time frame.
601	00:33:33	00:33:35	How is that going to help Nick?
602	00:33:35	00:33:40	The sperm found 15 a.m.
603	00:33:40	00:33:42	It’s all heads, no tails.
604	00:33:42	00:33:44	I’m not quite up to speed on the particulars of...
605	00:33:44	00:33:50	It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails 00 a.m.
606	00:33:50	00:33:52	00 a.m.
607	00:33:52	00:33:59	Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy’s murder but it doesn’t disprove Nick’s presence at the time of the homicide.
608	00:33:59	00:34:01	You could be a little more supportive.
609	00:34:03	00:34:05	I have a new favorite color.
610	00:34:05	00:34:10	Orange? The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the Thrift-Right jacket.
611	00:34:10	00:34:13	Guess where their regional headquarters is located.
612	00:34:13	00:34:14	The Hansen Building. You bet.
613	00:34:14	00:34:20	I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against Thrift-Right.
614	00:34:20	00:34:22	You get any hits? Norman Stirling.
615	00:34:22	00:34:24	Former manager.
616	00:34:24	00:34:27	How disgruntled? Let go last year.
617	00:34:27	00:34:28	Caused a commotion at H.Q.
618	00:34:28	00:34:31	Filed lawsuits against the company.
619	00:34:31	00:34:33	Guy’s been out of work ever since.
620	00:34:33	00:34:36	Sitting around making bombs.
621	00:34:42	00:34:44	Norman Stirling?
622	00:34:44	00:34:47	Yes.
623	00:34:47	00:34:49	What’s going on?
624	00:34:49	00:34:51	FP.
625	00:34:51	00:34:53	What?
626	00:34:53	00:34:55	You don’t recognize those initials?
627	00:34:58	00:35:00	What’s this about?
628	00:35:00	00:35:01	The bombing of the Thrift-Right Car Rental.
629	00:35:01	00:35:03	The bombing of the Hansen Building.
630	00:35:03	00:35:05	A-A bomb? Are you kidding?
631	00:35:05	00:35:08	I’ve never even been near a bomb my entire life.
632	00:35:08	00:35:14	Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in.
633	00:35:14	00:35:16	I used to wear those to go to work.
634	00:35:16	00:35:20	You were let go by Thrift-Right last year, and lost a court battle to get your job back.
635	00:35:20	00:35:26	In fact, they filed a TRO against you for throwing furniture around their headquarters last July.
636	00:35:26	00:35:28	I want to call my lawyer.
637	00:35:28	00:35:30	Good, you can call him from the car.
638	00:35:30	00:35:31	He can meet us at the PD.
639	00:35:31	00:35:32	Take him in. Come on, let’s go.
640	00:35:32	00:35:33	Call your mom.
641	00:36:47	00:36:50	Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash.
642	00:36:50	00:36:56	It’s fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer’s hands, right?
643	00:36:56	00:36:59	Abraded, yeah. And can you extract DNA from epithelials?
644	00:36:59	00:37:00	If they’re fresh enough.
645	00:37:16	00:37:20	Okay, epithelials are an affirmative.
646	00:37:20	00:37:22	And they’re good to go for DNA profiling.
647	00:37:22	00:37:25	I’m just going to need something to compare it to.
648	00:37:25	00:37:29	Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.
649	00:37:40	00:37:42	Well?
650	00:37:44	00:37:47	I think that you and I should head over to the police station.
651	00:37:49	00:37:52	DNA didn’t pan out, huh?
652	00:37:52	00:37:55	Never have I seen such a clean match.
653	00:37:57	00:37:58	Jack Willman killed her.
654	00:38:11	00:38:13	Thank you.
655	00:38:13	00:38:14	Hey...
656	00:38:14	00:38:17	Hey, I’m just doing my job.
657	00:38:17	00:38:22	Besides, if they’d sent you to jail I’d get stuck with all your cases.
658	00:38:27	00:38:29	Dispatch said you were looking for me?
659	00:38:29	00:38:30	Yeah.
660	00:38:30	00:38:33	I finally matched this FP.
661	00:38:33	00:38:35	To this electric etcher.
662	00:38:35	00:38:36	Now, I made an exemplar.
663	00:38:36	00:38:37	Boom!
664	00:38:37	00:38:39	Identical type of striations.
665	00:38:39	00:38:45	The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes.
666	00:38:45	00:38:47	And it’s only sold in bulk.
667	00:38:47	00:38:50	It was not sold to Norman Stirling.
668	00:38:50	00:38:53	So who bought it?
669	00:38:53	00:38:55	Las Vegas School District.
670	00:38:55	00:38:58	I called the district and we traced it down to one high school-- Summit High.
671	00:38:58	00:39:03	Stirling’s son goes there.
672	00:39:03	00:39:12	Tyler, were you aware of your father’s lawsuits against Thrift-Right Car Rental?
673	00:39:12	00:39:14	Yeah. It was kind of hard not to be.
674	00:39:14	00:39:19	I mean, it’s all him and my mom talked about for a year.
675	00:39:20	00:39:22	Until she left.
676	00:39:22	00:39:24	Do you miss your mother?
677	00:39:26	00:39:28	I miss our old life.
678	00:39:31	00:39:34	Is there something that we should be talking about?
679	00:39:34	00:39:35	You know, in private?
680	00:39:35	00:39:39	You said that’s how corporations do it--in private.
681	00:39:41	00:39:45	See, they treated him great at work, in front of everyone.
682	00:39:45	00:39:48	And then they let him go at the end of the day when no one’s around.
683	00:39:48	00:39:50	Thirty years of service and then...
684	00:39:50	00:39:54	you know, they realized they could hire two young guys at half the price.
685	00:39:54	00:39:58	What does FP stand for?
686	00:39:59	00:40:02	It was etched into both bombs.
687	00:40:02	00:40:06	We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.
688	00:40:10	00:40:12	Fair Play.
689	00:40:20	00:40:24	I used to yell that around the house that I was owed fair play.
690	00:40:24	00:40:27	I mean, they threw him out like trash.
691	00:40:27	00:40:29	And you sent them bombs?
692	00:40:29	00:40:34	You said you wanted to kill them.
693	00:40:39	00:40:41	How did you even know how to do this?
694	00:40:43	00:40:45	Off the Internet.
695	00:40:48	00:40:50	Dad, are you mad at me?
696	00:40:53	00:40:54	I did it for you.
697	00:40:54	00:40:57	Tyler, did you make any more bombs?
698	00:40:59	00:41:01	Where are they?
699	00:41:01	00:41:03	Where are you keeping them?
700	00:41:09	00:41:11	Tyler...
701	00:41:11	00:41:15	if you did this for me...
702	00:41:15	00:41:17	please tell them where they are.
703	00:41:20	00:41:24	( man over dispatch ) Victor 9, Victor 9, report to Summit High School.
704	00:41:24	00:41:27	Prairie road.
705	00:41:27	00:41:33	Reported bomb outside Classroom 22B in Locker 897.
706	00:41:34	00:41:37	Bomb is trigger-activated and motion-delayed.
707	00:41:37	00:41:38	Do not handle.
708	00:41:38	00:41:43	Students and faculty and all school personnel please exit the building immediately.
709	00:41:43	00:41:45	Security Detail, let’s go!
710	00:41:45	00:41:47	I need Classroom 22B.
711	00:41:47	00:41:48	Second floor! Where’s 22B?
712	00:41:48	00:41:49	Come on, people!
713	00:41:55	00:41:57	Come on, people, don’t run.
714	00:42:03	00:42:08	All students and faculty please exit the facilities immediately.
715	00:42:26	00:42:29	Get out of my way, people.
716	00:42:29	00:42:34	Come around me.
717	00:42:45	00:42:46	Dominic, stop!
718	00:42:46	00:42:47	Stop right there. Put it down!
719	00:42:47	00:42:49	No, it’s all right. Everyone’s safe.
720	00:42:49	00:42:52	No, no, no, drop it. It’s active!
721	00:43:13	00:43:15	Hi. Just the guy I wanted to see.
722	00:43:15	00:43:17	O’Riley.
723	00:43:19	00:43:20	Tell me why you did it.
724	00:43:20	00:43:22	I got nothing to say to you, cowboy.
725	00:43:24	00:43:29	She was going back to college, turning her life around getting out of the business, and you killed her for it!
726	00:43:29	00:43:30	Why?
727	00:43:30	00:43:31	Is that what she told you?
728	00:43:31	00:43:33	She was getting out of the business?
729	00:43:33	00:43:36	She was going to college to recruit more girls.
730	00:43:36	00:43:39	Do you think I’m going to believe the john that killed her?
731	00:43:39	00:43:41	Oh, and you think I was her client?
732	00:43:41	00:43:42	I was her pimp.
733	00:43:44	00:43:48	She was leaving me to start her own racket.
734	00:43:48	00:43:50	So wake up. This isn’t Pretty Woman.
735	00:43:50	00:43:51	She’s not Julia Roberts.
736	00:43:51	00:43:53	You’re not Richard Gere.
737	00:43:53	00:43:54	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
738	00:43:54	00:43:56	I guess you’re right.
739	00:43:56	00:44:00	Because there’s no happy ending for you.
740	00:44:00	00:44:03	Twenty-five to life.
741	00:44:03	00:44:05	Get him out of here.
742	00:44:18	00:44:21	Above the fold.
