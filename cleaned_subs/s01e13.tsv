0	0	00:00:13	00:00:14	Good afternoon, Mr. McGrath.	N
1	1	00:00:14	00:00:15	How’s the golf?	N
2	2	00:00:20	00:00:22	Hi.	N
3	3	00:00:22	00:00:23	You look lost.	N
4	4	00:00:23	00:00:28	Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the real estate office is at the end of the hall.	N
5	5	00:00:28	00:00:30	Okay? Bye.	N
6	6	00:00:30	00:00:32	Ooh, are those for me?	N
7	7	00:00:32	00:00:33	Hi, Dominic, sign here.	N
8	8	00:00:33	00:00:34	Okay.	N
9	9	00:00:34	00:00:37	I tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday.	N
10	10	00:00:37	00:00:39	I know, Elvis.	N
11	11	00:00:39	00:00:40	Okay.	N
12	12	00:00:40	00:00:41	See you. Okay, bye-bye.	N
13	13	00:00:42	00:00:44	Domino, it’s your turn to pick up dinner.	N
14	14	00:00:44	00:00:45	Okay, Jake-o.	N
15	15	00:00:45	00:00:47	Listen, uh, this goes to Cooley Real Estate.	N
16	16	00:00:47	00:00:48	That’s on two, all right?	N
17	17	00:00:48	00:00:51	And the Fed Ex is running a little bit late on the pick-up.	N
18	18	00:00:51	00:00:52	I’ll be back in...	N
19	19	00:00:52	00:00:54	hmm, about ten minutes, all right?	N
20	20	00:00:54	00:00:55	You got it. All right, buddy.	N
21	21	00:01:34	00:01:38	Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.	N
22	22	00:01:38	00:01:39	That’s what they do.	N
23	23	00:01:39	00:01:42	Put wet stuff on the red stuff.	N
24	24	00:01:42	00:01:45	We’re all clear to go in, but here’s what we’ve got.	N
25	25	00:01:45	00:01:46	Couple of head wounds.	N
26	26	00:01:46	00:01:48	Elderly guy had his arm torn off.	N
27	27	00:01:48	00:01:50	The only fatality so far is Jake Richards, a security guard.	N
28	28	00:01:50	00:01:53	Body’s still inside.	N
29	29	00:02:02	00:02:03	How big you think this bomb was?	N
30	30	00:02:03	00:02:05	It’s not the size of the bomb.	N
31	31	00:02:05	00:02:08	It’s the overpressure in the air around it.	N
32	32	00:02:25	00:02:27	The Van Gogh effect.	N
33	33	00:02:28	00:02:29	In stereo.	N
34	34	00:02:29	00:02:31	Both ears gone.	N
35	35	00:02:31	00:02:33	A perfectly symmetrical amputation.	N
36	36	00:02:33	00:02:36	Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.	N
37	37	00:02:36	00:02:41	So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.	N
38	38	00:02:43	00:02:45	Smell the sulfur?	N
39	39	00:02:45	00:02:47	Uh-huh.	N
40	40	00:02:50	00:02:51	Got your lighter, Jim?	N
41	41	00:02:51	00:02:53	Sure.	N
42	42	00:02:58	00:02:59	Light this.	N
43	43	00:03:02	00:03:04	Gunpowder.	N
44	44	00:03:04	00:03:06	Well, we know the propellant.	N
45	45	00:03:06	00:03:09	So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?	N
46	46	00:03:09	00:03:10	I’d love to.	N
47	47	00:03:12	00:03:14	Seat of the bomb is here.	N
48	48	00:03:14	00:03:17	Victim was thrown...	N
49	49	00:03:17	00:03:19	three meters.	Y
50	50	00:03:19	00:03:24	His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant.	Y
51	51	00:03:24	00:03:25	6,000-7,000 feet per second.	N
52	52	00:03:25	00:03:28	Who? Why?	N
53	53	00:03:28	00:03:31	Will he do it again?	N
54	54	00:03:31	00:03:33	Time will tell.	N
55	55	00:04:14	00:04:20	The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use.	N
56	56	00:04:20	00:04:24	Our murder weapon’s here someplace in a thousand pieces.	N
57	57	00:04:24	00:04:26	We have to find it and put it back together again.	N
58	58	00:04:26	00:04:27	Where do we start?	N
59	59	00:04:27	00:04:29	If it’s not growing pick it up.	N
60	60	00:04:29	00:04:32	We cart everything we find back to the lab. And then what?	Y
61	61	00:04:32	00:04:35	Stay curious.	N
62	62	00:04:36	00:04:38	Can you fill in the blanks?	N
63	63	00:04:38	00:04:39	Bombs explode.	N
64	64	00:04:39	00:04:42	Weird thing is their components survive the explosion.	N
65	65	00:04:42	00:04:45	If we can piece together this bomb we’re closer to finding who did this.	N
66	66	00:04:45	00:04:49	So, Warrick, when you’re photographing this debris can you, uh...?	N
67	67	00:04:49	00:04:52	Uh, I know, looky-loos.	N
68	68	00:05:38	00:05:41	Come on, Nick, it’s my last night in Sin City.	N
69	69	00:05:41	00:05:42	One more drink, man.	N
70	70	00:05:42	00:05:43	Oh, no, I just pulled a double.	N
71	71	00:05:43	00:05:45	And I still have to file my shift report.	N
72	72	00:05:45	00:05:47	Man, you’re off the clock.	N
73	73	00:05:47	00:05:50	You’d have never passed up a wild night back at A&amp;M.	N
74	74	00:05:50	00:05:52	Well, I guess I grew up.	N
75	75	00:05:52	00:05:53	Too bad, check that out.	N
76	76	00:06:00	00:06:01	Enjoy.	Y
77	77	00:06:01	00:06:03	You must really love your job, man.	Y
78	78	00:06:05	00:06:06	Ladies...	Y
79	79	00:06:14	00:06:16	Here you go. Thanks, man.	Y
80	80	00:06:16	00:06:17	Get your hands off me!	Y
81	81	00:06:17	00:06:19	Kristy, you’re not going anywhere.	Y
82	82	00:06:19	00:06:21	You got that?	Y
83	83	00:06:21	00:06:23	Come on. Relax a little bit.	N
84	84	00:06:23	00:06:24	Settle down.	N
85	85	00:06:24	00:06:26	Kristy? Kristy! You don’t own me, Jack.	Y
86	86	00:06:26	00:06:27	Nobody does.	N
87	87	00:06:27	00:06:28	Hey.	N
88	88	00:06:28	00:06:29	Back off.	Y
89	89	00:06:29	00:06:30	Hey, just mind your own business. Nick.	Y
90	90	00:06:30	00:06:32	I know him. He’s a cop.	Y
91	91	00:06:32	00:06:34	A crime scene investigator.	N
92	92	00:06:34	00:06:36	Nick, tell him to leave me alone.	N
93	93	00:06:36	00:06:39	Nobody tells me to do anything...	N
94	94	00:06:39	00:06:40	Hey, are we going to have a problem?	N
95	95	00:06:40	00:06:45	No, officer, we’re not going to have a problem.	N
96	96	00:06:45	00:06:46	I’ll see you around, baby.	N
97	97	00:06:55	00:06:57	You okay?	N
98	98	00:06:57	00:06:58	Yeah.	N
99	99	00:06:58	00:07:00	Yeah, I’m fine.	N
100	100	00:07:00	00:07:02	That was good timing. Thanks.	N
101	101	00:07:02	00:07:05	I suppose you need a ride.	Y
102	102	00:07:05	00:07:07	Do you mind?	N
103	103	00:07:07	00:07:09	No.	N
104	104	00:07:09	00:07:11	Come on.	N
105	105	00:07:11	00:07:12	Thanks.	N
106	106	00:07:14	00:07:18	Seems like every time we run into each other I’m getting into trouble.	N
107	107	00:07:18	00:07:22	Not that it’s any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.	N
108	108	00:07:22	00:07:25	Not every john is like that guy.	N
109	109	00:07:25	00:07:28	Besides, I’m making a change.	N
110	110	00:07:28	00:07:30	I’m going back to school.	N
111	111	00:07:30	00:07:32	Yeah?	N
112	112	00:07:32	00:07:34	I’ve always wanted to study communications.	N
113	113	00:07:34	00:07:35	I’m good with people.	N
114	114	00:07:35	00:07:38	That’s good.	N
115	115	00:07:38	00:07:40	You think so?	N
116	116	00:07:40	00:07:42	Yeah, I do.	N
117	117	00:07:42	00:07:45	Well, I’m going to go inside now.	N
118	118	00:07:47	00:07:52	Unless, of course, you’d like to come in for a drink.	N
119	119	00:07:52	00:07:55	I don’t think that’d be a good idea.	N
120	120	00:07:55	00:07:56	Come on.	N
121	121	00:07:56	00:08:00	Just ’cause you’re a crime scene analyst you don’t have to analyze everything.	N
122	122	00:08:25	00:08:27	FP.	N
123	123	00:08:33	00:08:36	Mr. Grissom.	N
124	124	00:08:39	00:08:40	Oh, uh...	N
125	125	00:08:40	00:08:42	Hi, I’ve...	N
126	126	00:08:42	00:08:44	I’ve, um, I’ve seen you on TV before.	N
127	127	00:08:44	00:08:46	I admire your work.	N
128	128	00:08:46	00:08:47	Well, thank you.	N
129	129	00:08:47	00:08:48	And your name is...?	N
130	130	00:08:48	00:08:49	Dominic.	N
131	131	00:08:49	00:08:53	Uh, i-c rather than with the i-c-k... uh, Kretzker.	N
132	132	00:08:53	00:08:56	I’m the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail.	N
133	133	00:08:56	00:08:58	Did somebody from Homicide talk to you yet?	N
134	134	00:08:58	00:09:01	Yeah, as a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you.	N
135	135	00:09:01	00:09:02	Because, well, we are...	N
136	136	00:09:02	00:09:04	you know, we’re both in law enforcement, and...	N
137	137	00:09:04	00:09:06	Right.	N
138	138	00:09:06	00:09:09	Did you know the victim-- the other security guard?	N
139	139	00:09:09	00:09:11	Oh, yeah, he was one of my best buddies.	N
140	140	00:09:11	00:09:16	As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes’ difference it would’ve been my face all over the news instead of his, right?	N
141	141	00:09:16	00:09:19	Would you, uh, like to be on the news?	N
142	142	00:09:19	00:09:19	Yeah.	N
143	143	00:09:19	00:09:21	Yeah.	N
144	144	00:09:21	00:09:23	I mean... only if I could help people, yes.	N
145	145	00:09:23	00:09:24	No, no.	N
146	146	00:09:24	00:09:26	I know what you’re thinking.	N
147	147	00:09:26	00:09:30	Uh, you know, my building blows up I’m over at Arby’s sucking down some extra sauce.	N
148	148	00:09:30	00:09:32	You know, how could I want to help people, right?	N
149	149	00:09:32	00:09:34	Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?	N
150	150	00:09:34	00:09:36	Well, I know a lot about bombs.	N
151	151	00:09:36	00:09:38	You know, pipe, power, powder.	N
152	152	00:09:38	00:09:41	The three Ps of mass destruction.	N
153	153	00:09:41	00:09:42	Huh.	N
154	154	00:09:42	00:09:44	Dominic...	N
155	155	00:09:44	00:09:45	with an i-c, not i-c-k... Yes sir?	N
156	156	00:09:45	00:09:48	Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?	N
157	157	00:09:48	00:09:51	Are you serious?	N
158	158	00:09:52	00:09:54	Yeah, yes, sir.	N
159	159	00:09:54	00:09:56	I’ll be honored, sir.	N
160	160	00:09:56	00:09:58	Oh.	N
161	161	00:09:58	00:10:02	But we can’t tell anybody on the day shift, though because they’re going to get real jealous.	N
162	162	00:10:02	00:10:04	That’s good thinking.	N
163	163	00:10:04	00:10:06	Would you excuse me a minute?	N
164	164	00:10:06	00:10:08	Yes.	Y
165	165	00:10:10	00:10:12	Keep an eye on that guy.	Y
166	166	00:10:13	00:10:15	Oh, yes!	N
167	167	00:10:15	00:10:18	Well, we got a live one out there.	N
168	168	00:10:18	00:10:20	I got a cop babysitting him.	N
169	169	00:10:20	00:10:22	How are you doing?	N
170	170	00:10:22	00:10:25	Well, are his initials FP?	N
171	171	00:10:25	00:10:29	No, Dominic Kretzker, why?	N
172	172	00:10:29	00:10:32	I found this near the point of origin.	N
173	173	00:10:33	00:10:37	Whoever did this is playing with us.	N
174	174	00:10:37	00:10:39	Or he wants to get caught.	N
175	175	00:10:45	00:10:47	Hey, it’s me.	N
176	176	00:10:47	00:10:48	You in the shower? What are you doing?	N
177	177	00:10:48	00:10:52	Anyway, if you check your messages I don’t have to work till later.	N
178	178	00:10:52	00:10:56	So I thought since you’re between careers you might want to grab a late...	N
179	179	00:10:56	00:10:58	breakfast.	N
180	180	00:11:02	00:11:04	Hey, Nick, what’s up?	N
181	181	00:11:04	00:11:06	Not a lot. What’s... what’s going on?	N
182	182	00:11:06	00:11:07	It’s a 4-19.	N
183	183	00:11:07	00:11:09	Dead prostitute.	N
184	184	00:11:09	00:11:12	Who’s the decedent?	N
185	185	00:11:12	00:11:14	Kristine Marie Hopkins.	N
186	186	00:11:14	00:11:16	Day shift’s got it covered.	N
187	187	00:11:18	00:11:19	You all right?	N
188	188	00:11:19	00:11:20	Yeah, I must’ve, uh...	N
189	189	00:11:20	00:11:21	I must’ve got my wires crossed.	N
190	190	00:11:21	00:11:22	I’ll see you.	N
191	191	00:11:22	00:11:24	All right, man.	N
192	192	00:11:27	00:11:31	All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right?	N
193	193	00:11:31	00:11:33	Then you cap it here, and you cap it here.	N
194	194	00:11:33	00:11:36	Now, the grains inside, all right...	N
195	195	00:11:36	00:11:39	they’re going to ignite and they’re gonna cause smoke.	N
196	196	00:11:39	00:11:41	Lots and lots of smoke.	N
197	197	00:11:41	00:11:44	Now, the problem is is all this smoke here, man, it’s got nowhere to go.	N
198	198	00:11:44	00:11:47	Okay, it starts cooking, and then...	N
199	199	00:11:47	00:11:49	Bob’s your uncle... Boom!	N
200	200	00:11:49	00:11:52	you do know a lot about bombs.	N
201	201	00:11:52	00:11:53	How’d you learn so much?	N
202	202	00:11:53	00:11:55	Oh, they don’t teach this stuff at universities.	N
203	203	00:11:55	00:11:56	You know, this is all trial and error.	N
204	204	00:11:56	00:12:00	So what, you just, uh, blow up bombs and study them?	N
205	205	00:12:00	00:12:01	Yeah. Yeah...	N
206	206	00:12:02	00:12:04	Margaret Finn, Public Defender.	N
207	207	00:12:04	00:12:06	Cease and desist any conversation with my client.	N
208	208	00:12:06	00:12:08	I’ve been assigned to you.	N
209	209	00:12:08	00:12:12	Guess the PD was thinking of all the lawsuits Richard Jewell brought when he was wrongfully accused.	N
210	210	00:12:12	00:12:15	Someone died in that office building.	N
211	211	00:12:15	00:12:19	Ma’am, you seem like a very nice person but these people--they’ve been very, very good to me.	N
212	212	00:12:19	00:12:21	I’m sure they have.	N
213	213	00:12:21	00:12:24	Dominic, I think you should roll with your attorney.	N
214	214	00:12:24	00:12:26	Thanks for your help, though.	N
215	215	00:12:26	00:12:27	All right.	N
216	216	00:12:27	00:12:28	I’ll see you guys later.	N
217	217	00:12:28	00:12:29	Listen, do me a favor.	N
218	218	00:12:29	00:12:33	Will you tell Grissom that if he needs me just call me at home, okay? All right.	N
219	219	00:12:33	00:12:34	Let’s roll.	Y
220	220	00:12:36	00:12:40	So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin?	Y
221	221	00:12:40	00:12:41	Yep.	N
222	222	00:12:41	00:12:44	How could the victim possibly have been in one piece?	N
223	223	00:12:44	00:12:46	Vacuum effect.	N
224	224	00:12:46	00:12:49	The air is being pushed out so fast...	N
225	225	00:12:49	00:12:52	and the bomb detonates...	N
226	226	00:12:52	00:12:54	there’s a calm at the center...	N
227	227	00:12:58	00:13:02	Calm, huh? Well, except for when he lost his ears.	N
228	228	00:13:02	00:13:04	Did you figure out what this FP stands for?	N
229	229	00:13:04	00:13:07	I ran it through ATF’s bomb database.	N
230	230	00:13:07	00:13:09	No profile.	N
231	231	00:13:09	00:13:11	So our bomber’s a newbie.	N
232	232	00:13:11	00:13:13	Does he fit Grissom’s wack job from the bomb site?	N
233	233	00:13:13	00:13:15	Dominic the security guard?	N
234	234	00:13:15	00:13:17	Ah, it’s too soon to tell.	N
235	235	00:13:17	00:13:19	I found something interesting.	N
236	236	00:13:19	00:13:21	What is it?	N
237	237	00:13:23	00:13:25	Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.	Y
238	238	00:13:25	00:13:26	Bomb was time-delayed.	N
239	239	00:13:26	00:13:28	This is a piece of the timing device.	N
240	240	00:13:28	00:13:30	What about the orange stuff?	N
241	241	00:13:30	00:13:34	Heat of the explosion must’ve melted whatever it is all around the wheel.	N
242	242	00:13:34	00:13:36	So Sara?	N
243	243	00:13:36	00:13:39	So what’s orange and melts?	N
244	244	00:13:39	00:13:41	I would have to investigate that.	N
245	245	00:13:41	00:13:42	Thank you.	N
246	246	00:13:42	00:13:44	Hey, guys.	N
247	247	00:13:44	00:13:45	Can I steal you for a minute?	N
248	248	00:13:45	00:13:46	I thought this was your day off.	N
249	249	00:13:46	00:13:47	We’re kind of busy here, Nick.	N
250	250	00:13:47	00:13:50	Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry, but I don’t think this can wait.	N
251	251	00:13:50	00:13:52	Okay.	N
252	252	00:13:56	00:13:59	You told me you weren’t dating her.	N
253	253	00:13:59	00:14:04	I wasn’t till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh... Jack.	N
254	254	00:14:04	00:14:07	And Ecklie’s at her house now.	N
255	255	00:14:07	00:14:09	Yeah, and I can tell you what he’s going to find.	N
256	256	00:14:09	00:14:12	My fingerprints, my DNA.	N
257	257	00:14:12	00:14:14	What were you thinking, Nicky?	N
258	258	00:14:14	00:14:17	I wasn’t.	N
259	259	00:14:17	00:14:21	We had a connection, you know?	N
260	260	00:14:21	00:14:24	Chemistry thing, I guess.	Y
261	261	00:14:24	00:14:27	She was irresistible, man.	Y
262	262	00:14:27	00:14:30	00.	Y
263	263	00:14:30	00:14:31	Ecklie’s going to be all over this.	N
264	264	00:14:32	00:14:35	Hey, Nick...	N
265	265	00:14:35	00:14:37	I’m sorry to hear about your friend.	N
266	266	00:14:37	00:14:39	Who told you?	N
267	267	00:14:39	00:14:40	Word travels.	N
268	268	00:14:40	00:14:42	It was the day shift coroner.	N
269	269	00:14:42	00:14:44	So people know I was with Kristy last night?	N
270	270	00:14:44	00:14:46	Not yet.	N
271	271	00:14:46	00:14:49	Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there.	N
272	272	00:14:49	00:14:53	When you’re a suspect and you’re innocent, you keep your mouth shut.	N
273	273	00:14:54	00:14:56	I’ll talk to Ecklie.	N
274	274	00:14:56	00:14:57	Bad idea. You and Ecklie...	N
275	275	00:14:57	00:14:58	oil and water.	N
276	276	00:14:58	00:15:00	Just let me get into it.	N
277	277	00:15:00	00:15:02	I can’t just sit here.	N
278	278	00:15:02	00:15:04	Okay, go for a walk.	N
279	279	00:15:04	00:15:07	Maybe you’ll accidentally bump into your guy, Jack?	N
280	280	00:15:07	00:15:09	Yeah.	N
281	281	00:15:09	00:15:12	I.D. him, but don’t approach him.	N
282	282	00:15:12	00:15:14	Okay.	N
283	283	00:15:19	00:15:23	If Nick’s arrested it’s not going to matter that he’s cleared later.	N
284	284	00:15:23	00:15:25	No, it’s an automatic dismissal.	N
285	285	00:15:30	00:15:33	25-year-old female Caucasian.	N
286	286	00:15:33	00:15:38	Liver temp’s indicating time of death at 0600.	N
287	287	00:15:38	00:15:42	Petichial hemorrhaging, cyanotic tongue.	N
288	288	00:15:44	00:15:45	Can I help you, Catherine?	N
289	289	00:15:45	00:15:46	I just want to see the body, David.	N
290	290	00:15:46	00:15:48	Unless I’m mistaken, this is Ecklie’s case.	N
291	291	00:15:48	00:15:50	Eyes, no hands.	N
292	292	00:15:52	00:15:54	Look at those ligature marks.	N
293	293	00:15:54	00:15:56	Petichials...	N
294	294	00:15:56	00:15:57	blue tongue, the works.	N
295	295	00:15:57	00:16:00	Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck.	N
296	296	00:16:00	00:16:02	She didn’t give up easy.	Y
297	297	00:16:02	00:16:04	Struggled and strangled.	Y
298	298	00:16:04	00:16:06	Ecklie find the murder weapon?	N
299	299	00:16:06	00:16:08	I only deal with bodies.	N
300	300	00:16:08	00:16:10	Did you check for fingerprints on the body?	N
301	301	00:16:10	00:16:14	Not yet. Half-life of fingerprints on flesh they’re disappearing as we speak.	N
302	302	00:16:14	00:16:15	Catherine, I like Nick, too.	N
303	303	00:16:15	00:16:17	I know you’re here for him.	N
304	304	00:16:17	00:16:19	But what if I lift his prints from her?	N
305	305	00:16:19	00:16:21	Then that’s what you report.	N
306	306	00:16:21	00:16:25	Evidence, Doc... all we got.	N
307	307	00:16:35	00:16:36	Hey.	N
308	308	00:16:36	00:16:38	Could you find that and turn it off, please?	Y
309	309	00:16:46	00:16:48	Find the clock our guy used?	N
310	310	00:16:48	00:16:49	Not yet.	N
311	311	00:16:49	00:16:50	This is a good choice.	N
312	312	00:16:50	00:17:08	According to the Bomb Data Center which has a record of every component used in any bomb-- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks-- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell Snoozewell, $10.99 at any local drugstore.	N
313	313	00:17:08	00:17:10	You’ve spoiled all my fun.	N
314	314	00:17:11	00:17:13	Gris, can I get clear on something here?	N
315	315	00:17:13	00:17:14	Anything’s possible.	N
316	316	00:17:14	00:17:21	Catherine gave me this FP which was part of the Hansen bomb and I’m supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it.	N
317	317	00:17:21	00:17:23	You isolate the tool, and then we trace it.	N
318	318	00:17:23	00:17:27	Yeah, but he could’ve used any number of things to initial it.	N
319	319	00:17:27	00:17:29	I mean, a screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter.	N
320	320	00:17:29	00:17:30	It’s the same as guns...	N
321	321	00:17:30	00:17:33	we eliminate them one at a time.	N
322	322	00:17:33	00:17:34	What are you guys doing?	N
323	323	00:17:34	00:17:37	We’re going to go blow up some bombs.	N
324	324	00:17:37	00:17:41	Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation.	N
325	325	00:17:41	00:17:44	Alas. Poor Warrick.	N
326	326	00:18:20	00:18:23	Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom’s in the field.	Y
327	327	00:18:23	00:18:25	I need to speak with him.	N
328	328	00:18:25	00:18:27	And I need to speak with you...	N
329	329	00:18:27	00:18:28	about Nick Stokes.	N
330	330	00:18:28	00:18:29	Well, let me guess...	N
331	331	00:18:29	00:18:31	about his involvement with a dead hooker?	N
332	332	00:18:31	00:18:34	Come on. The hooker was a person.	N
333	333	00:18:34	00:18:35	Her name was Kristy Hopkins.	N
334	334	00:18:35	00:18:36	I realize that. Thank you.	N
335	335	00:18:36	00:18:38	I just came from the lab.	N
336	336	00:18:38	00:18:40	His prints were all over Kristy Hopkins’ house.	N
337	337	00:18:40	00:18:43	Let’s see, wine glass...	N
338	338	00:18:43	00:18:44	oh, bedside table.	N
339	339	00:18:44	00:18:46	How’s it going, Cath?	N
340	340	00:18:46	00:18:49	Nick, I don’t think that you guys should be talking.	N
341	341	00:18:49	00:18:51	It’s no big deal.	N
342	342	00:18:51	00:18:52	What’s up, Ecklie?	N
343	343	00:18:52	00:18:55	I need a DNA sample from you, Nick.	N
344	344	00:18:55	00:18:59	I assume you’re trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night.	Y
345	345	00:18:59	00:19:01	We found a condom, used.	N
346	346	00:19:01	00:19:04	And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary.	N
347	347	00:19:04	00:19:06	And I have something else for you.	Y
348	348	00:19:08	00:19:10	I got this off a valet surveillance tape.	N
349	349	00:19:10	00:19:12	A license plate number?	N
350	350	00:19:12	00:19:14	Vehicle belongs to Jack Willman.	N
351	351	00:19:14	00:19:17	Had a fight with Kristy Hopkins outside the Orpheus last night around midnight.	Y
352	352	00:19:17	00:19:23	Well, I’ll look into it but come on, your fingerprints, your DNA that’s what’s going into evidence.	N
353	353	00:19:23	00:19:25	You just love that, don’t you?	N
354	354	00:19:25	00:19:27	You think I want to believe that a CSI could commit murder?	N
355	355	00:19:27	00:19:30	Hell, I don’t even want to believe that a CSI could sleep with a hooker.	N
356	356	00:19:30	00:19:31	You know what? Nick’s private life...	N
357	357	00:19:31	00:19:32	Is no longer private.	N
358	358	00:19:32	00:19:36	Catherine, I’m sorry if you guys don’t like where the evidence is pointing.	N
359	359	00:19:36	00:19:38	But show me otherwise, tell me I’m wrong.	N
360	360	00:19:38	00:19:40	In the meantime, my hands are tied.	N
361	361	00:19:40	00:19:42	I have protocol to follow.	N
362	362	00:19:46	00:19:47	I hate that guy.	N
363	363	00:19:47	00:19:50	Okay, look, I’m going to get O’Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning.	N
364	364	00:19:50	00:19:52	But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick.	N
365	365	00:19:52	00:19:54	Just don’t make it harder with Ecklie, okay?	N
366	366	00:19:54	00:19:55	Yeah.	N
367	367	00:19:57	00:19:59	We find the bomber by understanding the bomb.	N
368	368	00:19:59	00:20:02	Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container.	N
369	369	00:20:02	00:20:04	Aluminum briefcase.	N
370	370	00:20:04	00:20:05	And we know the timing device.	N
371	371	00:20:05	00:20:06	Snoozewell.	N
372	372	00:20:06	00:20:07	And the propellant.	N
373	373	00:20:07	00:20:08	Black gunpowder.	N
374	374	00:20:08	00:20:10	So the final piece of the bomber’s signature?	N
375	375	00:20:10	00:20:12	Identify the pipe containing the powder.	N
376	376	00:20:12	00:20:16	Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes.	N
377	377	00:20:16	00:20:20	Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied.	N
378	378	00:20:20	00:20:22	Number one is a plumber’s ex-flow pipe.	N
379	379	00:20:22	00:20:24	Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner.	N
380	380	00:20:24	00:20:28	Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.	N
381	381	00:20:35	00:20:36	You ready?	N
382	382	00:20:38	00:20:40	Let’s do it, Dan.	N
383	383	00:20:47	00:20:48	Green.	N
384	384	00:20:48	00:20:49	That’s the ex-flow pipe.	N
385	385	00:20:51	00:20:54	Inflow pipe, blue.	N
386	386	00:20:59	00:21:02	Red, the galvanized steel.	N
387	387	00:21:14	00:21:17	ten feet.	N
388	388	00:21:32	00:21:36	16 feet.	N
389	389	00:21:45	00:21:48	20 feet.	N
390	390	00:21:55	00:21:59	Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.	N
391	391	00:21:59	00:22:03	20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.	N
392	392	00:22:03	00:22:06	That’s the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.	N
393	393	00:22:06	00:22:11	So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel.	N
394	394	00:22:11	00:22:14	Like a muffler or a tailpipe.	N
395	395	00:22:14	00:22:16	I’ve seen it before.	N
396	396	00:22:16	00:22:17	It’s a common container for homemades.	N
397	397	00:22:17	00:22:20	Don’t you love the smell of sulfur in the afternoon?	N
398	398	00:22:20	00:22:23	You might want to go and take a tour of Dominic Kretzker’s house.	N
399	399	00:22:23	00:22:25	I tracked down the sale of Snoozewell clocks.	N
400	400	00:22:25	00:22:29	926 credit card purchases in the last three months in Clark County.	N
401	401	00:22:29	00:22:32	Seven to Dominic Kretzker of Prairie Road.	N
402	402	00:22:59	00:23:01	Hey, hey. That your scanner?	N
403	403	00:23:01	00:23:04	Yeah, that’s how I knew you were coming.	N
404	404	00:23:04	00:23:06	Makes me feel like I’m part of things.	N
405	405	00:23:06	00:23:08	Mr. Grissom.	N
406	406	00:23:08	00:23:10	What can I do for you guys?	N
407	407	00:23:10	00:23:15	Dominic... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb.	N
408	408	00:23:15	00:23:19	We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock.	N
409	409	00:23:19	00:23:22	Yeah, yeah, I recognize that.	N
410	410	00:23:22	00:23:24	That houses a nice little detonator.	N
411	411	00:23:24	00:23:27	Want to show us that clock of yours?	N
412	412	00:23:27	00:23:29	Oh, sure. Come on in.	N
413	413	00:23:32	00:23:34	The place is kind of a mess. Sorry.	N
414	414	00:23:34	00:23:35	Here.	N
415	415	00:23:35	00:23:38	Here it is.	N
416	416	00:23:39	00:23:41	TimeTell Snoozewell.	N
417	417	00:23:41	00:23:43	$10.99.	N
418	418	00:23:43	00:23:46	Well, you can get it for half price if you’ve got a coupon.	N
419	419	00:23:46	00:23:48	The timing device is still intact.	N
420	420	00:23:48	00:23:50	Yeah, ’cause I haven’t made the bomb yet.	N
421	421	00:23:50	00:23:53	But you have made bombs before, using parts from this make?	N
422	422	00:23:53	00:23:54	Well, yeah.	N
423	423	00:23:54	00:23:57	Yeah, I blow them out in back all the time.	N
424	424	00:23:57	00:23:59	I blasted a few of them a couple months ago.	N
425	425	00:23:59	00:24:02	Hey, look what I found.	N
426	426	00:24:02	00:24:02	Sulfur.	N
427	427	00:24:02	00:24:05	You blow up any bombs recently?	N
428	428	00:24:10	00:24:11	Is this from the Hansen bomb?	N
429	429	00:24:11	00:24:13	Sure is.	N
430	430	00:24:13	00:24:15	You’re keeping a key piece of evidence that could nail you?	N
431	431	00:24:15	00:24:17	Hey, that’s sentimental.	N
432	432	00:24:17	00:24:19	Well, that’s cute.	N
433	433	00:24:19	00:24:20	No, I mean, it is.	N
434	434	00:24:20	00:24:23	That’s like, you know, Waco and Trade Center.	N
435	435	00:24:23	00:24:25	I mean, that’s historical.	N
436	436	00:24:25	00:24:27	I didn’t have a war, all right?	N
437	437	00:24:27	00:24:28	I’m too flatfooted for the P.D.	N
438	438	00:24:28	00:24:30	and that’s as close to history as I’m going to get.	N
439	439	00:24:30	00:24:31	I collect souvenirs.	N
440	440	00:24:31	00:24:33	I mean, th-that’s my building, you know.	N
441	441	00:24:33	00:24:37	I mean... that was my place of employment, man.	N
442	442	00:24:37	00:24:40	You’re going to be sorry, talking to my client.	N
443	443	00:24:40	00:24:41	We called you. We left word.	N
444	444	00:24:41	00:24:43	Dominic, don’t speak.	N
445	445	00:24:43	00:24:45	If I had anything to hide, I’d hide it.	N
446	446	00:24:45	00:24:48	I’m pretty proud of that container piece, I’ll tell you.	N
447	447	00:24:48	00:24:51	Well, maybe so but you’re under arrest.	N
448	448	00:24:51	00:24:53	Put him in the car.	N
449	449	00:24:53	00:24:55	You-you kidding?	N
450	450	00:24:56	00:24:57	Oh.	N
451	451	00:24:59	00:25:00	( siren approaching ) Cuffs?	N
452	452	00:25:00	00:25:04	Those vultures never sleep, huh?	N
453	453	00:25:06	00:25:08	Could you do me a favor?	N
454	454	00:25:08	00:25:10	Can you put the jacket over them?	N
455	455	00:25:10	00:25:12	I don’t want to be seen like this.	N
456	456	00:25:12	00:25:13	Not on TV.	N
457	457	00:25:13	00:25:15	This is not who I am.	N
458	458	00:25:18	00:25:20	Thanks, partner.	N
459	459	00:25:23	00:25:29	I can’t tell whether he’s brilliant or... nuts.	N
460	460	00:25:29	00:25:30	Sound familiar?	N
461	461	00:25:30	00:25:34	Tell you one thing if he’s guilty he’s putting on one hell of a show.	N
462	462	00:26:10	00:26:13	Polyethylene? Terephtalete?	N
463	463	00:26:21	00:26:23	You contact her family?	N
464	464	00:26:23	00:26:25	No family to speak of.	N
465	465	00:26:25	00:26:27	Has anyone claimed her?	N
466	466	00:26:27	00:26:29	For burial? Friend, old roommate?	N
467	467	00:26:29	00:26:30	There’s no one.	N
468	468	00:26:30	00:26:31	City’ll be footing the bill.	N
469	469	00:26:35	00:26:37	No, I’ll pay.	N
470	470	00:26:37	00:26:39	Sure that’s prudent given the circumstances?	N
471	471	00:26:39	00:26:43	Doc, I’m giving this girl a proper burial.	N
472	472	00:26:44	00:26:46	I don’t much care about my career right now.	N
473	473	00:26:46	00:26:49	Someone wants to throw me in jail for that so be it.	N
474	474	00:26:56	00:27:01	How you doing? Just kind of using the current experience to understand the other side of law enforcement.	N
475	475	00:27:01	00:27:03	That’s resourceful.	N
476	476	00:27:03	00:27:06	You think I’m guilty, don’t you?	N
477	477	00:27:06	00:27:11	I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement.	N
478	478	00:27:11	00:27:12	That is crazy.	N
479	479	00:27:12	00:27:13	I mean, come on.	N
480	480	00:27:13	00:27:15	I’m one of the good guys.	N
481	481	00:27:15	00:27:17	The cops went through my things.	N
482	482	00:27:17	00:27:18	They find anything?	N
483	483	00:27:18	00:27:19	Dominic, you have an attorney now.	N
484	484	00:27:19	00:27:21	I can’t really talk to you about the case.	N
485	485	00:27:21	00:27:26	I was here on another matter and I thought I’d come by.	N
486	486	00:27:26	00:27:27	You do what I do.	N
487	487	00:27:27	00:27:28	Excuse me?	N
488	488	00:27:28	00:27:35	You don’t just like, stop by to see someone, you... make up excuse like I’m in the area, just stopping by.	N
489	489	00:27:35	00:27:38	Wow, you’re just like me.	N
490	490	00:27:38	00:27:41	Except better-looking.	Y
491	491	00:27:41	00:27:44	I’ll come by and see you later, okay?	Y
492	492	00:27:44	00:27:45	Okay.	N
493	493	00:27:51	00:27:53	What? Bad news.	N
494	494	00:27:53	00:27:54	Another Fourth of July.	N
495	495	00:27:54	00:27:57	Where? Thrift-Right Car Rental on Flamingo.	N
496	496	00:27:57	00:27:58	Ten minutes ago.	N
497	497	00:28:08	00:28:12	So, the manager was working the lot when he heard the blast.	N
498	498	00:28:12	00:28:17	Fatality was on the check-in line and died on the way to the hospital.	N
499	499	00:28:17	00:28:19	Anybody report hearing a noise? Ticking?	N
500	500	00:28:19	00:28:20	No, no one heard anything.	N
501	501	00:28:20	00:28:24	Ah, it’s not the firemen it’s the rain. This crime scene is trashed.	N
502	502	00:28:30	00:28:32	What do you have?	N
503	503	00:28:32	00:28:34	Form follows function.	N
504	504	00:28:34	00:28:36	They’ve never been able to make a better one.	N
505	505	00:28:36	00:28:38	Mousetrap.	N
506	506	00:28:38	00:28:40	That orange stuff again.	N
507	507	00:28:40	00:28:45	Someone picks it up, motion trips the trap, sets off the timer.	N
508	508	00:28:45	00:28:48	Which sets off the bomb.	N
509	509	00:28:53	00:28:56	Be right back.	N
510	510	00:28:56	00:28:57	We say nothing to the media or anybody.	N
511	511	00:28:57	00:29:00	Our bomber’s signature just got a little more sophisticated.	Y
512	512	00:29:00	00:29:02	Excuse me.	Y
513	513	00:29:02	00:29:03	Hi, I’m with the Crime Lab.	N
514	514	00:29:03	00:29:06	I’m sorry, but I have to take your jacket.	N
515	515	00:29:06	00:29:09	Um... okay.	Y
516	516	00:29:09	00:29:10	If it’ll help.	N
517	517	00:29:10	00:29:12	Thanks.	N
518	518	00:29:15	00:29:17	What are you doing?	N
519	519	00:29:17	00:29:20	Polyethylene-terephtalete.	Y
520	520	00:29:20	00:29:21	Polyester.	Y
521	521	00:29:21	00:29:23	Orange stuff.	N
522	522	00:29:25	00:29:28	You’re free to go.	Y
523	523	00:29:28	00:29:30	I wanted to tell you in person.	Y
524	524	00:29:30	00:29:32	You mean, you weren’t just in the neighborhood?	Y
525	525	00:29:32	00:29:35	That second bomb-- it wasn’t remote, was it?	Y
526	526	00:29:35	00:29:36	Otherwise I’d still be a suspect.	N
527	527	00:29:36	00:29:38	I can’t discuss it.	Y
528	528	00:29:38	00:29:42	So I guess you’re not going to be needing my expertise anymore.	Y
529	529	00:29:42	00:29:44	I mean, investigation-wise.	Y
530	530	00:29:44	00:29:47	I knew it was too good to be true.	N
531	531	00:29:47	00:29:51	Well, proud to have worked with you, sir.	Y
532	532	00:29:51	00:29:53	Dominic... I’m not a police officer.	Y
533	533	00:29:53	00:29:55	I-I-I’m a crime scene analyst.	N
534	534	00:29:55	00:29:58	Yeah, but we know who really solves the crimes, don’t we, sir?	Y
535	535	00:29:58	00:30:01	Good luck.	Y
536	536	00:30:01	00:30:02	Take care of yourself.	Y
537	537	00:30:02	00:30:03	Thank you.	Y
538	538	00:30:06	00:30:08	Hey, Dom?	N
539	539	00:30:08	00:30:13	Yeah? Next time try not to be quite so trusting.	Y
540	540	00:30:13	00:30:15	You don’t need to be a hero.	N
541	541	00:30:24	00:30:26	I ran priors.	Y
542	542	00:30:26	00:30:30	The guy’s got an ’88 conviction for sexual assault.	Y
543	543	00:30:30	00:30:33	Boy, if I ever get in trouble, I know which CSI I’m going to.	Y
544	544	00:30:35	00:30:38	Let’s watch the show.	N
545	545	00:30:44	00:30:48	How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins?	N
546	546	00:30:48	00:30:50	Oh, sir, we can just cut the crap.	N
547	547	00:30:50	00:30:52	I saw him kill Kristy.	N
548	548	00:30:52	00:30:54	I saw everything.	N
549	549	00:30:54	00:30:55	Go on.	N
550	550	00:30:55	00:30:58	Well, Kristy and I, we had words.	N
551	551	00:30:58	00:31:02	I was swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry but, uh...	N
552	552	00:31:04	00:31:07	I didn’t expect to see her with a guy.	N
553	553	00:31:07	00:31:08	They were fighting.	N
554	554	00:31:08	00:31:12	I couldn’t make out what they were saying but he was pushing her around pretty hard.	N
555	555	00:31:14	00:31:16	Could you I.D. this guy? Yeah.	N
556	556	00:31:16	00:31:18	It was like, Nick something.	N
557	557	00:31:18	00:31:22	Kristy and I bumped into him at The Orpheus earlier.	N
558	558	00:31:22	00:31:23	And you saw him kill her?	N
559	559	00:31:23	00:31:27	Well, I saw him get violent, but then I took off.	N
560	560	00:31:27	00:31:29	And you didn’t try to help the girl?	N
561	561	00:31:29	00:31:31	He’s one of you guys.	N
562	562	00:31:31	00:31:33	He carries a gun.	N
563	563	00:31:33	00:31:35	I’m no hero.	N
564	564	00:31:39	00:31:41	So can I go?	N
565	565	00:31:43	00:31:46	Yeah.	N
566	566	00:31:47	00:31:50	The witness sounds believable.	N
567	567	00:31:50	00:31:52	It’s a load of crap and you know it.	N
568	568	00:31:52	00:31:54	I was listening.	N
569	569	00:31:54	00:31:56	He seemed credible to me.	N
570	570	00:31:56	00:31:59	Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.	N
571	571	00:31:59	00:32:01	So what can you offer me?	N
572	572	00:32:01	00:32:04	Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience.	N
573	573	00:32:04	00:32:05	He didn’t do this.	N
574	574	00:32:05	00:32:10	Ignore the evidence against Stokes it looks like special favors for CSI.	N
575	575	00:32:10	00:32:11	Well, I can’t have that.	N
576	576	00:32:11	00:32:12	Not and keep my post.	N
577	577	00:32:12	00:32:17	So give me 12 hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.	N
578	578	00:32:17	00:32:20	12 hours.	N
579	579	00:32:20	00:32:26	But then we arrest Mr. Stokes with all the attendant documentation.	N
580	580	00:32:40	00:32:42	How you doing, Greg?	N
581	581	00:32:42	00:32:43	Same as you.	N
582	582	00:32:43	00:32:44	Yeah. Worried about Nick.	N
583	583	00:32:44	00:32:47	I need to see his DNA from the crime scene.	N
584	584	00:32:47	00:32:48	You have it, right?	N
585	585	00:32:48	00:32:50	A sample from the condom, yeah.	N
586	586	00:32:50	00:32:52	Popsicled in the freezer.	N
587	587	00:32:52	00:32:54	But, uh, it’s not your case.	N
588	588	00:32:54	00:32:57	Much as I want to help, no can do.	N
589	589	00:32:57	00:32:59	It’s my case for the next 12 hours.	N
590	590	00:32:59	00:33:02	Ask the Sheriff.	N
591	591	00:33:02	00:33:04	You know, I would never doubt your word.	Y
592	592	00:33:04	00:33:06	Smart man.	Y
593	593	00:33:13	00:33:15	Nick’s little soldiers.	N
594	594	00:33:15	00:33:17	It’s all you.	N
595	595	00:33:17	00:33:20	Thanks, Greg.	N
596	596	00:33:20	00:33:24	When did you say this sample was frozen?	N
597	597	00:33:24	00:33:25	15 a.m.	N
598	598	00:33:25	00:33:26	Why?	N
599	599	00:33:26	00:33:30	These guys are all heads, no tails.	N
600	600	00:33:30	00:33:33	That’s normal, given the post-ejaculate time frame.	N
601	601	00:33:33	00:33:35	How is that going to help Nick?	N
602	602	00:33:35	00:33:40	The sperm found 15 a.m.	N
603	603	00:33:40	00:33:42	It’s all heads, no tails.	N
604	604	00:33:42	00:33:44	I’m not quite up to speed on the particulars of...	N
605	605	00:33:44	00:33:50	It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails 00 a.m.	N
606	606	00:33:50	00:33:52	00 a.m.	N
607	607	00:33:52	00:33:59	Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy’s murder but it doesn’t disprove Nick’s presence at the time of the homicide.	Y
608	608	00:33:59	00:34:01	You could be a little more supportive.	N
609	609	00:34:03	00:34:05	I have a new favorite color.	N
610	610	00:34:05	00:34:10	Orange? The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the Thrift-Right jacket.	N
611	611	00:34:10	00:34:13	Guess where their regional headquarters is located.	N

666	666	00:38:45	00:38:47	And it’s only sold in bulk.	N
667	667	00:38:47	00:38:50	It was not sold to Norman Stirling.	N

680	680	00:39:35	00:39:39	You said that’s how corporations do it--in private.	N

682	682	00:39:45	00:39:48	And then they let him go at the end of the day when no one’s around.	N
683	683	00:39:48	00:39:50	Thirty years of service and then...	N
684	684	00:39:50	00:39:54	you know, they realized they could hire two young guys at half the price.	N

686	686	00:39:59	00:40:02	It was etched into both bombs.	N
687	687	00:40:02	00:40:06	We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.	N
688	688	00:40:10	00:40:12	Fair Play.	N
689	689	00:40:20	00:40:24	I used to yell that around the house that I was owed fair play.	N
