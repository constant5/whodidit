1,00:00:06,00:00:08,"(faint slicing, gurgling)"
2,00:00:08,00:00:10,(screams)
3,00:00:12,00:00:14,(hacking)
4,00:00:14,00:00:16,(coughing)
5,00:00:23,00:00:24,MAN: Cut!
6,00:00:25,00:00:26,Cut! Damn it!
7,00:00:26,00:00:27,(bell ringing)
8,00:00:27,00:00:28,Can somebody please get her a glass of water?!
9,00:00:29,00:00:31,What happened? Babe? (coughing continues)
10,00:00:31,00:00:33,What are you doing? Are you choking on the blood?
11,00:00:33,00:00:35,I did what you told me to.
12,00:00:35,00:00:37,"Yeah, but this time, get it on her face, not in her mouth."
13,00:00:37,00:00:39,The mouth is part of the face.
14,00:00:39,00:00:40,"Yeah, I know, I know."
15,00:00:40,00:00:42,"But hit her from the side, from the side."
16,00:00:42,00:00:43,And get plenty on the rack.
17,00:00:45,00:00:46,We're dying here.
18,00:00:47,00:00:48,I'm going to go ring it.
19,00:00:48,00:00:50,"All right. Hey, grab me a bear claw."
20,00:00:50,00:00:51,"How long have I known you, huh?"
21,00:00:51,00:00:52,This is you and me.
22,00:00:53,00:00:54,Get the shot-- not too tight.
23,00:00:54,00:00:56,Wide enough to fit in the fun bags.
24,00:00:56,00:00:57,Baby-cakes...
25,00:00:57,00:00:59,Where was I? Want me to laugh?
26,00:01:00,00:01:01,Don't laugh. You were scary. Get away.
27,00:01:01,00:01:04,"Honey, this time, don't inhale the blood, okay?"
28,00:01:04,00:01:06,"All right, let's get her cleaned up."
29,00:01:06,00:01:09,Let's shoot this bitch. Oh...
30,00:01:09,00:01:11,"Not you, baby. The shot. The shot's a bitch."
31,00:01:11,00:01:12,I love one-ers.
32,00:01:12,00:01:14,And you know what else I love? I love sushi.
33,00:01:14,00:01:16,"Me, too. Do you want to go for sushi?"
34,00:01:16,00:01:19,"MAN: Our lead actress, Weatherly Adams, had her dressing room violated last night."
35,00:01:20,00:01:22,BRASS: So she's the one you suspect is missing?
36,00:01:22,00:01:23,She missed her call this morning.
37,00:01:24,00:01:25,The woman is nothing if not professional.
38,00:01:25,00:01:28,She's predictably precisely 35 minutes late every day.
39,00:01:28,00:01:30,You could set your watch to it.
40,00:01:30,00:01:32,She's already... three hours late and still no sign.
41,00:01:32,00:01:33,Okay.
42,00:01:33,00:01:35,(loud popping)
43,00:01:35,00:01:36,"Nothing to worry about, gentlemen."
44,00:01:36,00:01:37,It's just a bad bulb.
45,00:01:37,00:01:41,"If you will, please, follow me."
46,00:01:47,00:01:49,Here we are.
47,00:01:52,00:01:54,Check out the flowers in the vase.
48,00:01:54,00:02:02,"""Congratulations on your last film."" Any idea who sent her these, Mr. Vespucci?"
49,00:02:02,00:02:08,"Stalkers, creeps, cranks, nut balls, degenerates-- we get them all here."
50,00:02:08,00:02:10,Weatherly attracts them like flies.
51,00:02:10,00:02:14,"These are, uh, some of the guys we've had trouble with in the past."
52,00:02:14,00:02:15,I'll take that.
53,00:02:16,00:02:18,When was the last time you saw her?
54,00:02:18,00:02:19,At wrap yesterday.
55,00:02:19,00:02:22,"We shot all night, finished about 4:00 in the morning."
56,00:02:22,00:02:24,Did anyone see her leave the building?
57,00:02:24,00:02:27,Her car's still parked out back.
58,00:02:27,00:02:28,This hers? Yeah.
59,00:02:28,00:02:30,"(recording): Hi, it's Weatherly."
60,00:02:30,00:02:32,Leave a message or I'll scream. (giggles)
61,00:02:33,00:02:34,"Wallet, keys, and cell phone still in there."
62,00:02:34,00:02:35,Still no answer on her home phone.
63,00:02:36,00:02:38,I'll send a patrol car to her house.
64,00:02:38,00:02:41,"You said there was a break in, why don't you show me?"
65,00:02:41,00:02:45,"VESPUCCI: Ah, Weatherly..."
66,00:02:45,00:02:49,"how has she died for us, let me count the ways."
67,00:02:49,00:03:02,"Bludgeoned, boiled, filleted, defenestrated, decapitated, disemboweled, oh, yeah, and strangled with her own intestines."
68,00:03:02,00:03:06,Autopsied while still alive.
69,00:03:06,00:03:13,"Made to eat her own liver, fed slowly through a tree chipper, roasted and served on a bed of Belgian endive."
70,00:03:13,00:03:18,"When Weatherly Adams dies, it's money in the bank."
71,00:03:18,00:03:20,"Here you are, gentlemen."
72,00:03:20,00:03:27,"Looks like somebody broke the glass, reached in, unlocked it and opened it."
73,00:03:27,00:03:31,"Yeah, that's the way I found it when I got here this evening."
74,00:03:49,00:03:52,"Uh, Jim..."
75,00:03:52,00:03:57,I got her.
76,00:04:01,00:04:04,And I believe she's died for the last time.
77,00:04:10,00:04:13,and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
78,00:04:41,00:04:45,STOKES: Whoever stuck her under this poster was trying to send a twisted message.
79,00:04:45,00:04:47,"Either that, or the killer's got a wicked sense of humor."
80,00:04:47,00:04:50,(camera shutter clicks)
81,00:04:51,00:04:57,"Lividity is fixed along the anterior aspect, and..."
82,00:04:57,00:04:59,she is still in full rigor.
83,00:04:59,00:05:03,She was last seen alive about 15 hours ago.
84,00:05:03,00:05:05,No panties.
85,00:05:05,00:05:07,I'll do an S.A.E. kit.
86,00:05:09,00:05:13,"(inflecting): ""The horror."" (exaggerating): The horror..."
87,00:05:13,00:05:15,Huh?
88,00:05:15,00:05:17,Bra-Brando?
89,00:05:17,00:05:19,Brando from Apocalypse Now?
90,00:05:19,00:05:21,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I know, Dave."
91,00:05:21,00:05:22,Everybody knows that.
92,00:05:22,00:05:27,Oh. I'll get the gurney.
93,00:05:31,00:05:35,WILLOWS: Looks like the lady lost a heel.
94,00:05:35,00:05:39,"There's a whole lot of something here, but it doesn't really look like blood to me."
95,00:05:39,00:05:43,"No, it's, uh, it's the wrong color."
96,00:05:43,00:05:45,It's too red.
97,00:05:45,00:05:48,Smells sweet.
98,00:05:48,00:05:52,Karo syrup and food coloring-- it's prop blood.
99,00:05:52,00:05:54,And I am not seeing any prints.
100,00:05:54,00:05:56,It's been wiped clean.
101,00:05:56,00:06:01,"The question is, where does the fake blood end and the real blood begin?"
102,00:06:01,00:06:03,(tearfully screaming)
103,00:06:05,00:06:06,(crying)
104,00:06:06,00:06:12,"Now, I know this may come as a shock to most of you, and I'm sorry for your loss."
105,00:06:12,00:06:18,"I understand that Weatherly Adams was a long-time member of this company... Well, do you have a suspect?"
106,00:06:18,00:06:21,"Uh, sir, we just found the body about an hour ago."
107,00:06:22,00:06:24,We're just beginning our investigation.
108,00:06:24,00:06:25,"Yeah, I get it, I get it. I mean, it could be anyone."
109,00:06:26,00:06:32,"BRASS: Now, I'm going to have to look at your IDs and I'm going to take statements and fingerprints from all of you."
110,00:06:32,00:06:34,And I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
111,00:06:34,00:06:36,Anything we can do to help.
112,00:06:36,00:06:39,So what am I supposed to do today? Edit.
113,00:06:39,00:06:41,"VESPUCCI: Excuse me, Mr. Brass."
114,00:06:41,00:06:45,Do you think that it would be all right if we were to... continue to shoot...
115,00:06:45,00:06:46,No.
116,00:06:47,00:06:49,I want that little twerp Zarco found and locked up.
117,00:06:49,00:06:50,"Uh, who are you?"
118,00:06:50,00:06:52,Vincent Lafoon. This is my brother Mason.
119,00:06:52,00:06:53,We own this place.
120,00:06:53,00:06:54,Who's Zarco?
121,00:06:54,00:06:56,Oliver Zarco. He used to work here.
122,00:06:56,00:07:01,"He had a thing for Weatherly, and then he got hurt, blamed it on us, went a little nuts."
123,00:07:01,00:07:02,He was the one who got...
124,00:07:03,00:07:04,He was the one who sent the flowers and the note.
125,00:07:04,00:07:06,So he's done this before.
126,00:07:06,00:07:08,"Yeah, like, three times. Would you shut it?"
127,00:07:08,00:07:10,Three times. He's your guy.
128,00:07:11,00:07:13,Do you have video surveillance by any chance?
129,00:07:13,00:07:16,"Yeah, only on the exterior, but the video system's been on the fritz lately."
130,00:07:16,00:07:18,I had it repaired three days ago-- I'll get the tapes.
131,00:07:19,00:07:20,"Oh, good."
132,00:07:20,00:07:23,"Look, just find Zarco, okay?"
133,00:07:23,00:07:25,"MAN: Everyone, come together."
134,00:07:25,00:07:27,"Um, I can't, I still can't believe she's gone."
135,00:07:27,00:07:31,I mean... she was a... she was a real beautiful lady.
136,00:07:31,00:07:36,Let's form a circle and touch hands with someone you care about.
137,00:07:36,00:07:45,"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."
138,00:07:45,00:07:49,"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me..."
139,00:08:28,00:08:29,(camera shutter clicking)
140,00:08:53,00:08:55,How's it going in here?
141,00:08:55,00:08:57,The vase is clean.
142,00:08:57,00:09:01,"I've got a spiral notebook filled with dates, times and weights."
143,00:09:01,00:09:04,Looks like she was a bit concerned about her size.
144,00:09:04,00:09:06,(chuckles)
145,00:09:06,00:09:07,Actors.
146,00:09:09,00:09:12,You really don't recognize her?
147,00:09:12,00:09:13,(grunting): No.
148,00:09:13,00:09:15,"You've ever seen Chop Chop, Fizz Fizz?"
149,00:09:15,00:09:16,No.
150,00:09:16,00:09:18,"Can I Lick The Spoon? Please, David."
151,00:09:18,00:09:19,They're classics.
152,00:09:19,00:09:21,Those are not classics. (grunts)
153,00:09:23,00:09:25,The Exorcist. The Shining.
154,00:09:25,00:09:26,Rosemary's Baby.
155,00:09:26,00:09:28,Those are classics.
156,00:09:28,00:09:30,You know what I loved about her?
157,00:09:30,00:09:33,She really made you feel the terror.
158,00:09:33,00:09:38,"When she was scared for her life, I was scared, too."
159,00:09:41,00:09:44,Interesting.
160,00:09:46,00:09:48,BRASS: Mr. Zarco...
161,00:09:48,00:09:52,tell me about you and Weatherly Adams.
162,00:09:52,00:09:56,ZARCO: It was the happiest time in my life.
163,00:09:56,00:09:58,I had realized my dream.
164,00:09:58,00:10:00,I was working in the movies.
165,00:10:00,00:10:05,"Though I was only in an entry-level position, Weatherly and I were already an item."
166,00:10:05,00:10:07,Just like...
167,00:10:07,00:10:10,Julia Roberts and what's his name.
168,00:10:10,00:10:13,(indistinct cast and crew chatter)
169,00:10:13,00:10:15,We were in love.
170,00:10:18,00:10:22,And then it was all over in an instant.
171,00:10:22,00:10:24,(screams)
172,00:10:24,00:10:25,"Oh, God! (screams)"
173,00:10:26,00:10:28,"(screaming): Oh, my God!"
174,00:10:28,00:10:33,I was in rehab for six months.
175,00:10:33,00:10:37,That slime ball Lafoon convinced me not to file a Worker's Compensation claim.
176,00:10:38,00:10:40,He said that he'd take care of me.
177,00:10:40,00:10:41,And you trusted him?
178,00:10:41,00:10:51,"Yes. And then, when the deadline passed to file my claim, Vincent offered me two grand, take it or leave it, and then he fired my ass."
179,00:10:51,00:10:54,"And I could have lived with that, but..."
180,00:10:54,00:10:56,But what?
181,00:10:58,00:11:01,Weatherly...
182,00:11:01,00:11:03,dumped me.
183,00:11:03,00:11:07,She felt we were no longer compatible.
184,00:11:07,00:11:12,"The truth was, she couldn't stand to look at me."
185,00:11:12,00:11:14,She cried when she told me.
186,00:11:14,00:11:17,Actresses can do that.
187,00:11:17,00:11:21,The smell of her skin...
188,00:11:21,00:11:25,like fresh lemon poppy seed scones baking in the oven.
189,00:11:27,00:11:32,Gold flecks that danced like Valkyries in the emerald depths of her eyes.
190,00:11:32,00:11:33,"Her hair-- oh, God..."
191,00:11:33,00:11:35,Her hair...
192,00:11:35,00:11:37,So you started stalking her.
193,00:11:38,00:11:43,"I brought her gifts from time to time, to let her know that I still loved her."
194,00:11:43,00:11:44,Is that against the law?
195,00:11:44,00:11:46,It is if you break in to do it.
196,00:11:46,00:11:48,They wouldn't let me in the front door.
197,00:11:48,00:11:50,So you came in through the window.
198,00:11:50,00:11:52,"Only this time, you got caught."
199,00:11:52,00:12:01,"You argued. She told you where to shove your flowers, and you thought to yourself, ""You know, do I really need this aggravation?"" So you killed the bitch."
200,00:12:01,00:12:04,I thinkyoukilled the bitch.
201,00:12:04,00:12:05,Why would I kill her?
202,00:12:05,00:12:07,How should I know? Do I know you?
203,00:12:07,00:12:10,"Listen, Zarco, you whack job, you'd better focus!"
204,00:12:10,00:12:11,You focus. I'm trying to explain to you.
205,00:12:11,00:12:13,I haven't been near that place in over a year.
206,00:12:14,00:12:15,You got the wrong guy.
207,00:12:15,00:12:17,I don't do that anymore. I'm in therapy now.
208,00:12:17,00:12:19,Lots of therapy.
209,00:12:19,00:12:23,"Freudian, Jungian, Gestaltian-- all that crap."
210,00:12:23,00:12:26,I've let go of my anger.
211,00:12:27,00:12:29,Have you seen Catherine around?
212,00:12:29,00:12:30,"No, why?"
213,00:12:30,00:12:38,"'Cause I just got the DNA results for Weatherly Adams, and the skin under her nails and the semen from her S.A.E., they both belong to Vaughn Krunty. Who?"
214,00:12:38,00:12:42,"Vaughn Krunty, aka ""Zack Putrid."" Who's that?"
215,00:12:42,00:12:44,"The Titan of Terror, the Sultan of Slash."
216,00:12:44,00:12:46,He's the movie director.
217,00:12:46,00:12:51,I just... I found him in CODIS for a statutory rape charge in Laughlin when he was 18 and the girl was 16. Can you believe that?
218,00:12:51,00:12:53,What's the matter with you?
219,00:12:53,00:12:55,Nothing.
220,00:12:55,00:13:01,"Go tell Catherine what you found, make sure that you pull all the old evidence out of storage in case she needs it."
221,00:13:01,00:13:03,Okay.
222,00:13:06,00:13:13,(screaming)
223,00:13:13,00:13:15,(scoffs) Please.
224,00:13:15,00:13:18,"That looks pretty stupid, doesn't it?"
225,00:13:18,00:13:25,"Well, you could cut out earlier, maybe go to a wide exterior shot, you could carry the scream over a big flock of birds taking off."
226,00:13:26,00:13:27,Yeah?
227,00:13:27,00:13:30,Or... yeah...
228,00:13:30,00:13:32,"Or not. Or not, just..."
229,00:13:32,00:13:35,"Bad idea. All right, okay."
230,00:13:35,00:13:37,(Putrid chuckles)
231,00:13:37,00:13:39,Detective Brass.
232,00:13:39,00:13:41,"(chuckling): Man, I love that."
233,00:13:41,00:13:42,Detective Brass.
234,00:13:43,00:13:45,"You're a detective, and your name is Brass."
235,00:13:45,00:13:46,I can use that.
236,00:13:46,00:13:49,That's like a cop named Officer Copper.
237,00:13:49,00:13:52,Or a tin horn sheriff named Sheriff Tin.
238,00:13:52,00:13:55,"You cannot write that stuff. Listen, buddy..."
239,00:13:55,00:13:57,"Dude, I know why you're here, okay?"
240,00:13:57,00:13:59,"Weatherly and I, yes, we were knocking boots, man."
241,00:13:59,00:14:01,"So, you acknowledge having sex with her?"
242,00:14:01,00:14:04,"Well, yeah, I just said I had sex..."
243,00:14:04,00:14:05,Why would I deny it?
244,00:14:05,00:14:08,"Hey, I bang all my stars."
245,00:14:08,00:14:09,It builds trust.
246,00:14:09,00:14:12,It's part of my process.
247,00:14:12,00:14:14,We found traces of your skin under her fingernails.
248,00:14:14,00:14:17,"Maybe she wasn't into your ""process,"" so you raped her."
249,00:14:17,00:14:19,(chuckles)
250,00:14:19,00:14:21,You find that funny?
251,00:14:21,00:14:23,"Dude, you gotta see this."
252,00:14:23,00:14:24,You're gonna love it. Bring up Double D.
253,00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
254,00:14:26,00:14:27,Here goes.
255,00:14:27,00:14:30,"Hi, baby. Hi. (man laughing)"
256,00:14:30,00:14:32,PUTRID: Check it out.
257,00:14:32,00:14:34,Money. Money.
258,00:14:34,00:14:36,"Oh, yeah."
259,00:14:36,00:14:37,You're a star.
260,00:14:37,00:14:39,I can't believe this is my life.
261,00:14:39,00:14:41,"Oh, man, oh, man..."
262,00:14:41,00:14:44,"Come over here, baby."
263,00:14:44,00:14:45,(sighs) Okay.
264,00:14:45,00:14:48,(both sighing and moaning)
265,00:14:48,00:14:50,This what you do all day?
266,00:14:50,00:14:53,Does that look like a woman being taken against her will?
267,00:14:53,00:14:56,That still doesn't explain how your skin got under her fingernails.
268,00:14:56,00:14:59,Weatherly was...
269,00:14:59,00:15:00,how can I put this delicately?
270,00:15:00,00:15:02,"She was an ass-scratcher, man."
271,00:15:02,00:15:05,She liked to scratch my ass.
272,00:15:05,00:15:09,"She wasn't pushing me away, man, she was pulling me in."
273,00:15:10,00:15:12,"Brass, look at my ass."
274,00:15:12,00:15:13,Freaking claw marks.
275,00:15:13,00:15:17,"Are you trying to make me throw up, Mr. Putrid?"
276,00:15:17,00:15:19,(purrs)
277,00:15:27,00:15:29,(device beeping)
278,00:15:36,00:15:38,(beeping continues)
279,00:15:49,00:15:51,(panting)
280,00:15:56,00:15:57,(motor revs)
281,00:15:57,00:15:59,(screams)
282,00:16:03,00:16:04,(screams)
283,00:16:10,00:16:11,"(laughing): Oh, my God."
284,00:16:11,00:16:14,How awesome.
285,00:16:14,00:16:18,That is so cool. I can't believe you worked for Repulsion Pictures.
286,00:16:18,00:16:23,"Well, I did it on a whim. I was supposed to be an extra, but then they liked me, so they gave me this whole featured bit."
287,00:16:23,00:16:25,I got 600 bucks for that. What?
288,00:16:25,00:16:27,What? I was fresh out of college.
289,00:16:27,00:16:28,I really needed the money.
290,00:16:28,00:16:30,I don't get it-- what's the thrill here?
291,00:16:30,00:16:34,"It's always hot babes with huge breasts falling out of their shirts, getting hacked up..."
292,00:16:34,00:16:38,I don't have huge breasts. Mine are kind of... medium.
293,00:16:38,00:16:39,But perfect...
294,00:16:40,00:16:43,...ly adequate.
295,00:16:43,00:16:45,"Better, in fact."
296,00:16:45,00:16:46,Okay.
297,00:16:46,00:16:48,"Uh, I'm out of here."
298,00:16:48,00:16:49,"Hey, let's watch it again."
299,00:16:51,00:17:02,"ROBBINS: When I removed the axe, I noticed that the dermis along the margin of the wound showed no vital response, except in a small area on both sides of the center of the track."
300,00:17:02,00:17:06,"The cause of death was perforation of the liver, spleen, and pancreas."
301,00:17:06,00:17:11,But the injuries are inconsistent with the position of the axe wound.
302,00:17:11,00:17:13,The axe isn't what killed her.
303,00:17:13,00:17:22,"Exactly. The perforation was caused by a sharp, hollow, cylindrical object entering through the lower back, and then passing upwards into the organs."
304,00:17:22,00:17:25,"Like a spear, or a pipe of some kind?"
305,00:17:25,00:17:27,Perhaps.
306,00:17:27,00:17:32,"If the axe was planted in her back postmortem to conceal the original puncture site, then..."
307,00:17:32,00:17:34,we don't have a murder weapon.
308,00:17:34,00:17:39,JOHNSON: The only thing I found on the surveillance tapes was this.
309,00:17:39,00:17:41,That guy looks familiar.
310,00:17:43,00:17:45,"Oh, that's Vincent Lafoon."
311,00:17:45,00:17:46,He and his brother own the place.
312,00:17:47,00:17:50,"Well, here's where it gets a little weird."
313,00:17:50,00:17:51,(beeps)
314,00:17:51,00:17:54,He's trying to make it look like somebody broke in.
315,00:17:54,00:17:57,I think he's framing Zarco.
316,00:17:57,00:18:00,"If he owns the place, he must have known about the surveillance cameras."
317,00:18:00,00:18:04,Right? Why would he let himself get caught on tape?
318,00:18:04,00:18:08,"I don't know, but according to Brass' notes, he thought the system was down."
319,00:18:08,00:18:13,"So, we found no physical evidence linking Zarco to the scene."
320,00:18:13,00:18:15,Vincent knew he had an easy fall guy.
321,00:18:15,00:18:17,He's been playing us the whole time.
322,00:18:17,00:18:21,"(whirring, beeping)"
323,00:18:21,00:18:25,"Hey, you're making a big mistake; you got the wrong dude."
324,00:18:25,00:18:27,"Yeah, a lot of guys tell me that."
325,00:18:27,00:18:30,But I didn't do anything. Why would I kill Weatherly?
326,00:18:30,00:18:32,"She was my company's best asset. Plus, I liked her."
327,00:18:32,00:18:35,She was my friend.
328,00:18:36,00:18:38,That's him. That's Zarco. That's your guy.
329,00:18:38,00:18:39,"What happened, Lafoon?"
330,00:18:39,00:18:42,"She get too old, so you killed her for real?"
331,00:18:42,00:18:44,Where's he going?
332,00:18:44,00:18:46,I don't know. Probably out for a nice dinner.
333,00:18:46,00:18:47,You're letting him go?
334,00:18:47,00:18:48,Are you out of your mind?
335,00:18:48,00:18:49,We've got nothing on him.
336,00:18:50,00:18:51,"But I'm the one getting set up here, me!"
337,00:18:52,00:18:54,Don't let him go-- I'm telling you-- you'll regret this.
338,00:18:54,00:18:57,"I never touched her. You know it, I know it, and they know it."
339,00:18:57,00:18:59,"You killed her, and you're going down."
340,00:18:59,00:19:02,(grunting and groaning)
341,00:19:04,00:19:06,Can I go now?
342,00:19:06,00:19:09,"Yeah, get out of here while I'm still in a good mood."
343,00:19:09,00:19:10,"So long, Lafoon."
344,00:19:10,00:19:13,I hope they tear you a big one.
345,00:19:13,00:19:16,(chuckles)
346,00:19:22,00:19:23,What's up?
347,00:19:27,00:19:34,"You know, in the slasher movies, when they go after the dark-haired girl, she always dies?"
348,00:19:34,00:19:39,Yeah. And the blond always lives.
349,00:19:39,00:19:43,Aren't you glad it wasn't a movie?
350,00:19:43,00:19:46,(giggles)
351,00:19:49,00:19:52,"I think, um..."
352,00:19:52,00:19:57,I think I am sick of having my face shoved in death every day.
353,00:19:57,00:20:01,The murder rate has gone up every year since I've been here.
354,00:20:01,00:20:05,"It's totally out of control, and..."
355,00:20:05,00:20:09,we're not even slowing them down.
356,00:20:09,00:20:17,"After examining the crime scene, I determined there were between 200 and 300 milliliters-- that's less than a cup-- of Weatherly's actual blood outside of her body."
357,00:20:17,00:20:23,"Originally, we had assumed that the axe blade had sealed the wound, that the position of her body had caused her to bleed internally."
358,00:20:23,00:20:28,"But if she had been gored first by another weapon and then axed, there would have been a lot more blood."
359,00:20:28,00:20:35,"Right, right. So, I compared the initial coroner's report with the last entry in her weight loss journal-- which was taken no more than an hour or two before her death."
360,00:20:35,00:20:36,And guess what?
361,00:20:37,00:20:38,Her body came up light?
362,00:20:39,00:20:40,Six pounds light.
363,00:20:40,00:20:45,That's six pints of blood at a pound each nowhere in or around the body.
364,00:20:45,00:20:47,She was moved.
365,00:20:50,00:20:52,Hey.
366,00:20:52,00:20:54,The trace from the puncture wound came back.
367,00:20:54,00:21:01,"It's zinc, which is electrically coated onto steel to make galvanized pipe."
368,00:21:01,00:21:06,"Well, we should go back, expand the search perimeter, try to find the actual murder site."
369,00:21:06,00:21:07,Okay. I'll get a hold to Swing.
370,00:21:07,00:21:09,We're going to need some help.
371,00:21:09,00:21:10,Okay.
372,00:21:17,00:21:20,(vehicle approaching)
373,00:21:26,00:21:30,I heard you're holding Vincent Lafoon on suspicion of murder.
374,00:21:30,00:21:31,His lawyer called me.
375,00:21:32,00:21:33,I'd be surprised.
376,00:21:33,00:21:38,"Yes, the guy is a bit rough around the edges, but I don't think that he, uh..."
377,00:21:40,00:21:41,Hello.
378,00:21:45,00:21:47,Nick.
379,00:21:47,00:21:52,"Why don't you, uh, take the offices, and Ronnie and I will start in the storage area."
380,00:21:52,00:21:55,My name is Stanley.
381,00:21:55,00:21:58,But you call me Stan.
382,00:22:08,00:22:10,(sighs)
383,00:23:01,00:23:04,"STOKES: Hey. Hey, Nicky, what do you got?"
384,00:23:04,00:23:07,I've got the hat Lafoon was wearing in the surveillance video.
385,00:23:07,00:23:14,The wear on the strap indicates that's it's been set larger... like it was adjusted for somebody with a bigger head or something.
386,00:23:14,00:23:18,"So I'm going to get it back, see if I can get some prints off it."
387,00:23:18,00:23:21,"Okay, I'll, uh, meet you back at the lab."
388,00:23:25,00:23:27,Howdy.
389,00:23:27,00:23:31,Dickie Jones. And you are?
390,00:23:31,00:23:33,Busy.
391,00:23:33,00:23:36,"How about after your shift, I take you out for a cup of coffee?"
392,00:23:36,00:23:39,And I could tell you my whole life story.
393,00:23:40,00:23:41,"No, thanks."
394,00:23:41,00:23:44,"It's just a cup of coffee, doll."
395,00:23:44,00:23:46,I'm not asking you to make love.
396,00:23:48,00:23:49,(sucks air through teeth)
397,00:23:49,00:23:52,"Not right away, anyway."
398,00:23:52,00:23:55,"You know, I could open up new worlds to you."
399,00:23:55,00:23:59,Have you ever had the back of those thighs kissed by a man... who's standing up?
400,00:23:59,00:24:02,(laughs)
401,00:24:02,00:24:04,So you find dwarves funny?
402,00:24:04,00:24:05,(continues laughing)
403,00:24:05,00:24:07,"Sometimes, yeah."
404,00:24:07,00:24:09,"Come on, what do you say?"
405,00:24:09,00:24:10,Is it because of my receding hairline?
406,00:24:12,00:24:16,I don't go out with persons of interest in an ongoing investigation.
407,00:24:16,00:24:20,"Well, I just think you might be missing out, Pookie."
408,00:24:21,00:24:23,Don't call me Pookie.
409,00:24:24,00:24:27,But you haven't told me your name.
410,00:24:27,00:24:28,(softly): Catherine.
411,00:24:28,00:24:31,Catherine. Catherine.
412,00:24:31,00:24:33,Catherine.
413,00:24:33,00:24:42,"Well, Catherine, we little people see things from a different perspective-- things other people might miss."
414,00:24:44,00:24:55,"If you're implying that you know something about Weatherly's death, and you're not giving it up, that makes you, at a minimum, an accessory after the fact, and that buys a long stretch for a stubby guy."
415,00:24:55,00:24:57,"I'm just talking, doll-face."
416,00:24:57,00:24:59,Dickie.
417,00:24:59,00:25:01,Why don't we leave the nice woman alone to do her work?
418,00:25:01,00:25:03,Here's my card.
419,00:25:03,00:25:08,If there's anything that you want to tell me as it pertains to the case...
420,00:25:08,00:25:09,"uh, call me."
421,00:26:22,00:26:27,"Hey, Archie, could you bring up the surveillance video from Repulsion Pictures, please?"
422,00:26:27,00:26:29,"Yeah, got it over here."
423,00:26:33,00:26:34,(clears throat)
424,00:26:34,00:26:38,(computer beeping)
425,00:26:38,00:26:41,What's the best you can get me on the face?
426,00:26:41,00:26:43,"(pushes buttons, computer beeps)"
427,00:26:45,00:26:50,He seems to be deliberately looking away from the camera.
428,00:26:50,00:26:52,Take him to the window.
429,00:26:53,00:26:56,(computer whirs) Freeze that.
430,00:26:57,00:26:58,Zoom in on the sleeve.
431,00:27:00,00:27:03,Does that jacket look a little small for that guy to you?
432,00:27:03,00:27:04,Maybe.
433,00:27:04,00:27:06,I measured the height of the window.
434,00:27:06,00:27:07,It's five feet.
435,00:27:07,00:27:09,How tall is the guy?
436,00:27:11,00:27:14,"Well, he's a head taller than that window."
437,00:27:14,00:27:15,Vincent Lafoon's only five-foot-ten.
438,00:27:15,00:27:19,"This guy's six-foot-two, six-foot-three, easy."
439,00:27:19,00:27:21,And a lot rounder.
440,00:27:21,00:27:24,The only guy that big in the bunch is Mason.
441,00:27:24,00:27:26,"Catherine, it's Nick."
442,00:27:26,00:27:28,"Listen, the surveillance video footage is a fake."
443,00:27:28,00:27:31,I think we got the wrong brother in custody.
444,00:27:31,00:27:33,I think Mason set up Vincent to set Oliver up.
445,00:27:33,00:27:36,It's getting complicated.
446,00:27:40,00:27:42,(thunder rumbling)
447,00:27:55,00:27:57,"Hey, Ronnie, anything?"
448,00:27:57,00:28:00,LAKE: No.
449,00:28:00,00:28:01,(thunder rumbles)
450,00:28:01,00:28:04,This place is creeping me out.
451,00:28:04,00:28:06,WILLOWS: It's supposed to.
452,00:28:15,00:28:17,(rain beating down steadily)
453,00:28:17,00:28:21,(thunder crackles)
454,00:28:49,00:28:53,(thunder rumbling)
455,00:29:05,00:29:07,(squeaking)
456,00:29:07,00:29:09,(chuckling)
457,00:29:09,00:29:11,I think we just found our murder weapon.
458,00:29:11,00:29:13,Hidden in plain sight.
459,00:29:23,00:29:25,Catherine?
460,00:29:26,00:29:29,I've got something else here.
461,00:29:35,00:29:37,Looks like Weatherly's missing heel.
462,00:29:39,00:29:41,(grunts)
463,00:29:41,00:29:43,"(Weatherly whimpers, attacker grunts)"
464,00:29:43,00:29:46,This is where she died.
465,00:29:46,00:29:48,(thunder booms)
466,00:29:48,00:29:51,(whirring)
467,00:29:52,00:29:53,"WILLOWS: Ah, damn."
468,00:29:53,00:29:55,"Oh, good."
469,00:29:55,00:29:59,Auxiliary generator just kicked in.
470,00:29:59,00:30:01,And I don't have any service.
471,00:30:03,00:30:06,"Mine's dead, too."
472,00:30:06,00:30:08,I'm going to get a dolly for you to move this thing.
473,00:30:09,00:30:11,Photo it and get it back to the lab.
474,00:30:11,00:30:14,Okay.
475,00:30:52,00:30:54,Can you help?
476,00:30:54,00:30:56,Thanks.
477,00:31:06,00:31:08,Damn it.
478,00:31:14,00:31:17,"Control, this is C-147 Lake for C13 Willows."
479,00:31:17,00:31:19,"DISPATCH: Copy, C-147."
480,00:31:19,00:31:21,Stand by.
481,00:31:21,00:31:23,"C-147, you have C-13. Over."
482,00:31:24,00:31:25,This is Catherine.
483,00:31:25,00:31:28,"Hey, Catherine, I left my cell phone at the studio."
484,00:31:28,00:31:30,I need to go back and get it.
485,00:31:30,00:31:31,"Yeah, you'd better."
486,00:31:31,00:31:32,They're department issue.
487,00:31:32,00:31:34,"And if you lose it, you replace it."
488,00:31:34,00:31:36,Does that include the cost of the contract?
489,00:31:36,00:31:38,"Oh, yeah."
490,00:31:38,00:31:39,Damn.
491,00:31:39,00:31:41,I'll see you later.
492,00:31:46,00:31:47,(engine starts)
493,00:31:47,00:31:49,(thunder rumbling)
494,00:31:59,00:32:01,(thunder cracks)
495,00:32:08,00:32:09,WILLOWS: We found the pipe that killed Weatherly.
496,00:32:10,00:32:11,It's in the print lab being processed.
497,00:32:11,00:32:14,She was killed on the soundstage and then dragged over.
498,00:32:14,00:32:16,BRASS: We've got a warrant out for Mason Lafoon.
499,00:32:16,00:32:17,We're looking for him now.
500,00:32:17,00:32:18,Okay. let me know what you find out.
501,00:32:18,00:32:19,(call waiting beeps)
502,00:32:21,00:32:23,(sighs)
503,00:32:23,00:32:24,(phone beeps)
504,00:32:24,00:32:26,What do you want?
505,00:32:26,00:32:28,"DICKIE: Pookie, it's me, Dickie. I know."
506,00:32:28,00:32:31,I've got information I think you might be interested in.
507,00:32:31,00:32:32,"Okay, shoot."
508,00:32:32,00:32:34,No. It has to be in person.
509,00:32:34,00:32:35,Where are you?
510,00:32:35,00:32:37,I'm at the studio.
511,00:32:37,00:32:40,I thought there was no phone transmission from there.
512,00:32:40,00:32:41,There wasn't. Now there is.
513,00:32:41,00:32:43,That's how it is with phones and electrical storms.
514,00:32:43,00:32:44,"Look, it's urgent."
515,00:32:45,00:32:46,Get here as soon as you can.
516,00:32:46,00:32:47,I just came from there.
517,00:32:47,00:32:50,"Why didn't you tell me then, you annoying little man?"
518,00:32:50,00:32:53,The situation is evolving.
519,00:32:53,00:32:57,"If you're screwing with me, I will to string you up and beat you senseless."
520,00:32:57,00:32:59,I look forward to it.
521,00:32:59,00:33:01,Just hurry.
522,00:33:03,00:33:05,"BRASS: That's you, Mason."
523,00:33:05,00:33:11,"All six feet, three inches of you impersonating your brother, which makes you good for Weatherly's murder."
524,00:33:11,00:33:13,"You did that one, too, didn't you? No, no, no."
525,00:33:13,00:33:14,"Nobody killed Weatherly, okay?"
526,00:33:14,00:33:16,"She killed herself. Oh, really?"
527,00:33:16,00:33:17,"What, she axed herself in the back?"
528,00:33:17,00:33:18,"No, you don't understand."
529,00:33:18,00:33:20,She... she... It was an accident.
530,00:33:20,00:33:21,She tripped.
531,00:33:21,00:33:23,"Good night, Weatherly."
532,00:33:23,00:33:24,"Good night, kid. Yeah, great stuff tonight."
533,00:33:24,00:33:25,Have a good night. See you tomorrow.
534,00:33:25,00:33:27,See you tomorrow. Okay.
535,00:33:27,00:33:28,"Whoa, ah!"
536,00:33:28,00:33:30,(shrieks) (body thuds)
537,00:33:36,00:33:37,Call 911!
538,00:33:37,00:33:38,Call 911!
539,00:33:38,00:33:39,"Wait, let's think about this."
540,00:33:39,00:33:40,"No, but Stanley... Mason, she's dead!"
541,00:33:40,00:33:42,This time she's not coming back.
542,00:33:42,00:33:44,We've got so many health and safety violations.
543,00:33:44,00:33:55,"If we report one more set-related accident-- especially one resulting in a death-- we will lose our bond, our liability insurance, OSHA will shut us down, we'll get our asses sued for wrongful death, and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures!"
544,00:33:55,00:33:56,Is that what you want?
545,00:33:56,00:33:58,Is that what you want?!
546,00:33:58,00:33:59,No!
547,00:33:59,00:34:05,"He... he said ""the show must go on,"" th-that Weatherly... would have wanted it that..."
548,00:34:05,00:34:06,I don't...
549,00:34:06,00:34:08,We... we didn't kill anybody.
550,00:34:08,00:34:10,"But you made it look like a murder, and then you framed your brother."
551,00:34:10,00:34:14,"Well, he's been treating me like crap my entire life."
552,00:34:14,00:34:16,(chuckles)
553,00:34:16,00:34:20,"Yeah, but for that, you're going to send him to jail for the rest of his life?"
554,00:34:20,00:34:23,This was all... this was all Stanley's idea.
555,00:34:23,00:34:25,Do you realize how much trouble you're in?
556,00:34:25,00:34:29,"Look, Stanley was the one who wanted to frame Vincent, okay?"
557,00:34:30,00:34:36,All I was supposed to do was clean up the accident scene and pretend to be Vince and buy the roses and that was it.
558,00:34:36,00:34:37,The rest was him.
559,00:34:37,00:34:40,"If you don't believe me, talk to the dwarf."
560,00:34:43,00:34:45,Why? What did he have to do with it?
561,00:34:45,00:34:47,Dickie saw the whole thing.
562,00:34:47,00:34:50,...and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures.
563,00:34:50,00:34:51,Is that what you want?
564,00:34:51,00:34:53,Is that what you want?! No!
565,00:34:53,00:34:56,MASON: And he's been trying to shake down Stanley ever since.
566,00:34:56,00:34:59,"Well, that would explain the animosity."
567,00:35:04,00:35:06,(thunder cracks)
568,00:35:07,00:35:10,(thunder rumbling)
569,00:35:23,00:35:24,(gasps)

572,00:35:47,00:35:52,"Control, this is C-13 Willows, trying to contact C-147 Lake."
573,00:35:52,00:35:55,"DISPATCH: C-13, Control. Copy. Stand by."
574,00:35:55,00:35:57,(thundering)
575,00:35:57,00:35:59,"Hello, Dispatch?"
576,00:36:02,00:36:04,Hello?
577,00:36:04,00:36:08,"DISPATCH: C-13, Control. C-147 is not responding."
578,00:36:08,00:36:11,"Okay, thanks. Over and out."
579,00:36:12,00:36:13,(three rapid beeps)
580,00:36:15,00:36:17,(two gunshots)

585,00:36:56,00:36:57,(gasping)
586,00:36:58,00:37:00,"(whispering): Catherine, it's Ronnie."
587,00:37:00,00:37:02,I'm stuck at Repulsion Pictures.
588,00:37:02,00:37:03,I need backup.
589,00:37:03,00:37:06,"Ronnie... uh, I'm, I'm coming."
590,00:37:06,00:37:09,Just... just stay on the line.
591,00:37:09,00:37:11,Ronnie?
592,00:37:11,00:37:12,(line clicks and goes dead)
593,00:37:12,00:37:14,Ronnie!
594,00:37:14,00:37:16,Hello?
595,00:37:16,00:37:17,(three rapid beeps)
596,00:37:18,00:37:23,"Dispatch, this is C-13 Willows requesting backup to meet me at Repulsion Pictures."
597,00:37:24,00:37:27,(siren wailing)
598,00:37:32,00:37:34,(thunder cracks)
599,00:37:51,00:37:53,(screams)
600,00:37:54,00:37:56,You gotta help me.
601,00:37:56,00:37:57,I'm shot! I'm shot!
602,00:37:57,00:37:59,You gotta get us out of here.
603,00:37:59,00:38:01,It's gonna be okay. Keep your voice down.
604,00:38:01,00:38:02,(gasping)
605,00:38:02,00:38:05,Do you know how many people I've killed in this place?
606,00:38:05,00:38:06,Shh!
607,00:38:06,00:38:10,"The irony is exquisite, but the pain is more formidable, you know?"
608,00:38:11,00:38:14,I think the pain is preventing me from enjoying the irony.
609,00:38:14,00:38:15,Shh!
610,00:38:15,00:38:16,(softly): Shut up!
611,00:38:16,00:38:18,But I...
612,00:38:18,00:38:21,"For the love of God, stop talking."
613,00:38:21,00:38:24,(siren wailing)
614,00:38:29,00:38:31,"(weakly): Oh, that's not good."
615,00:38:31,00:38:32,(coughs)
616,00:38:32,00:38:36,I should really stop talking and-and try and relax.
617,00:38:36,00:38:38,"That's good. Yeah, stop talking."
618,00:38:38,00:38:39,But I can't stop talking.
619,00:38:39,00:38:41,I've got that thing that...
620,00:38:41,00:38:43,It's a syndrome.
621,00:38:43,00:38:44,It's a word... There's a word for it.
622,00:38:44,00:38:45,Shh-shh-shh!
623,00:38:45,00:38:47,People have it. It's a syndrome.
624,00:38:47,00:38:48,I can't stop talking.
625,00:38:48,00:38:50,STANLEY: Zack.
626,00:38:54,00:38:56,(whimpering)
627,00:38:56,00:38:58,Stanley...
628,00:38:58,00:39:00,"Stanley, don't shoot me again."
629,00:39:00,00:39:01,"I don't want to die, okay?"
630,00:39:01,00:39:03,You already shot me twice.
631,00:39:03,00:39:05,"I learned my lesson, okay?"
632,00:39:05,00:39:08,"Sir, I'm a CSI."
633,00:39:08,00:39:10,Think about what you're doing.
634,00:39:10,00:39:12,(thundering)
635,00:39:12,00:39:13,Put down your weapon.
636,00:39:13,00:39:16,"I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that."
637,00:39:16,00:39:19,"(gun cocks, Putrid sobbing)"
638,00:39:31,00:39:33,(gasps)
639,00:39:39,00:39:41,Are you okay?
640,00:39:43,00:39:44,Yeah.
641,00:39:45,00:39:46,(Zack weeping)
642,00:40:01,00:40:03,I really loved her.
643,00:40:06,00:40:08,(thunder rumbling)
644,00:40:14,00:40:16,(sighs)
645,00:40:22,00:40:24,(thunder cracks)
646,00:40:29,00:40:34,"ZACK: I'm editing late, like I always do, and I hear a shot."
647,00:40:37,00:40:39,"So, I go outside and check it out."
648,00:40:39,00:40:41,(crank clicking)
649,00:40:47,00:40:49,Stanley!
650,00:40:49,00:40:52,You gotta help me hide the dwarf before the cops come back.
651,00:40:52,00:40:55,Dickie was blackmailing us about Weatherly's accident.
652,00:40:55,00:40:56,He wants to bring the whole company down.
653,00:40:56,00:40:58,But you killed him!
654,00:40:58,00:40:59,You killed Dickie!
655,00:40:59,00:41:00,"What's it gonna be, Zack?"
656,00:41:00,00:41:02,You gonna help me here or what?!
657,00:41:02,00:41:04,"Next thing you know, I'm running for my life."
658,00:41:04,00:41:06,And the nut job is chasing me.
659,00:41:06,00:41:09,"He shoots me, and then I see the hot..."
660,00:41:09,00:41:11,you.
661,00:41:11,00:41:14,"And all I can think the whole time is, ""Man, this is great."
662,00:41:14,00:41:20,"I could use this stuff."" I mean, this is life imitating art imitating life."
663,00:41:21,00:41:22,You are so beautiful.
664,00:41:22,00:41:25,"You are... Your, your face is so expressive."
665,00:41:25,00:41:27,It-it emotes.
666,00:41:27,00:41:29,You do terror so good.
667,00:41:29,00:41:31,I wasn't acting. I know.
668,00:41:31,00:41:32,I'll see you.
669,00:41:32,00:41:34,"Well, hey, listen."
670,00:41:34,00:41:39,"If you ever get tired of fighting crime, you know, there's always a future for you in the horror business."
671,00:41:39,00:41:41,"I mean, I'll take you there."
672,00:41:41,00:41:43,"Thanks, but I like what I'm doing."
673,00:41:43,00:41:45,"Oh, hey, the offer's still good."
674,00:41:45,00:41:46,"Okay, thanks."
675,00:41:47,00:41:48,"No, I'm serious."
676,00:41:48,00:41:49,I could build an entire franchise around you.
677,00:41:49,00:41:50,Bye.
678,00:41:50,00:41:52,Seriously. Give me a call.
679,00:41:52,00:41:55,"(man screams, maniacal laughter)"
680,00:41:55,00:41:56,(woman screams)
681,00:41:56,00:41:59,(horror movie climax music playing)
682,00:41:59,00:42:01,(maniacal laughter)
683,00:42:01,00:42:04,(woman screaming)
684,00:42:04,00:42:06,(horror movie climax music grows louder)
685,00:42:06,00:42:08,(door hinges creaking)
686,00:42:10,00:42:12,(screaming and maniacal laughter grow louder)
687,00:42:12,00:42:14,That is impressive.
688,00:42:14,00:42:20,"As the woman's throat is being slashed, you can actually see the entire transverse view of the trachea."
689,00:42:20,00:42:21,That's all you've got to say?
690,00:42:21,00:42:24,I believe I can see the epiglottis.
691,00:42:24,00:42:26,Epiglottis?
692,00:42:26,00:42:27,What about the pathos?
693,00:42:27,00:42:29,I mean... what about the humanity?
694,00:42:29,00:42:33,This may be Weatherly's finest performance.
695,00:42:33,00:42:35,"Oh, just watch the movie."
