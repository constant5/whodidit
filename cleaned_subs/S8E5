0	00:00:23	00:00:24	Cut!
1	00:00:25	00:00:26	Cut! Damn it!
2	00:00:27	00:00:28	Can somebody please get her a glass of water?!
3	00:00:29	00:00:31	What happened? Babe? (coughing continues)
4	00:00:31	00:00:33	What are you doing? Are you choking on the blood?
5	00:00:33	00:00:35	I did what you told me to.
6	00:00:35	00:00:37	Yeah, but this time, get it on her face, not in her mouth.
7	00:00:37	00:00:39	The mouth is part of the face.
8	00:00:39	00:00:40	Yeah, I know, I know.
9	00:00:40	00:00:42	But hit her from the side, from the side.
10	00:00:42	00:00:43	And get plenty on the rack.
11	00:00:45	00:00:46	We're dying here.
12	00:00:47	00:00:48	I'm going to go ring it.
13	00:00:48	00:00:50	All right. Hey, grab me a bear claw.
14	00:00:50	00:00:51	How long have I known you, huh?
15	00:00:51	00:00:52	This is you and me.
16	00:00:53	00:00:54	Get the shot-- not too tight.
17	00:00:54	00:00:56	Wide enough to fit in the fun bags.
18	00:00:56	00:00:57	Baby-cakes...
19	00:00:57	00:00:59	Where was I? Want me to laugh?
20	00:01:00	00:01:01	Don't laugh. You were scary. Get away.
21	00:01:01	00:01:04	Honey, this time, don't inhale the blood, okay?
22	00:01:04	00:01:06	All right, let's get her cleaned up.
23	00:01:06	00:01:09	Let's shoot this bitch. Oh...
24	00:01:09	00:01:11	Not you, baby. The shot. The shot's a bitch.
25	00:01:11	00:01:12	I love one-ers.
26	00:01:12	00:01:14	And you know what else I love? I love sushi.
27	00:01:14	00:01:16	Me, too. Do you want to go for sushi?
28	00:01:16	00:01:19	Our lead actress, Weatherly Adams, had her dressing room violated last night.
29	00:01:20	00:01:22	So she's the one you suspect is missing?
30	00:01:22	00:01:23	She missed her call this morning.
31	00:01:24	00:01:25	The woman is nothing if not professional.
32	00:01:25	00:01:28	She's predictably precisely 35 minutes late every day.
33	00:01:28	00:01:30	You could set your watch to it.
34	00:01:30	00:01:32	She's already... three hours late and still no sign.
35	00:01:32	00:01:33	Okay.
36	00:01:35	00:01:36	Nothing to worry about, gentlemen.
37	00:01:36	00:01:37	It's just a bad bulb.
38	00:01:37	00:01:41	If you will, please, follow me.
39	00:01:47	00:01:49	Here we are.
40	00:01:52	00:01:54	Check out the flowers in the vase.
41	00:01:54	00:01:58	Congratulations on your last film.
42	00:01:58	00:02:02	Any idea who sent her these, Mr. Vespucci?
43	00:02:02	00:02:08	Stalkers, creeps, cranks, nut balls, degenerates-- we get them all here.
44	00:02:08	00:02:10	Weatherly attracts them like flies.
45	00:02:10	00:02:14	These are, uh, some of the guys we've had trouble with in the past.
46	00:02:14	00:02:15	I'll take that.
47	00:02:16	00:02:18	When was the last time you saw her?
48	00:02:18	00:02:19	At wrap yesterday.
49	00:02:19	00:02:22	00 in the morning.
50	00:02:22	00:02:24	Did anyone see her leave the building?
51	00:02:24	00:02:27	Her car's still parked out back.
52	00:02:27	00:02:28	This hers? Yeah.
53	00:02:28	00:02:30	Hi, it's Weatherly.
54	00:02:30	00:02:32	Leave a message or I'll scream. (giggles)
55	00:02:33	00:02:34	Wallet, keys, and cell phone still in there.
56	00:02:34	00:02:35	Still no answer on her home phone.
57	00:02:36	00:02:38	I'll send a patrol car to her house.
58	00:02:38	00:02:41	You said there was a break in, why don't you show me?
59	00:02:41	00:02:45	Ah, Weatherly...
60	00:02:45	00:02:49	how has she died for us, let me count the ways.
61	00:02:49	00:03:02	Bludgeoned, boiled, filleted, defenestrated, decapitated, disemboweled, oh, yeah, and strangled with her own intestines.
62	00:03:02	00:03:06	Autopsied while still alive.
63	00:03:06	00:03:13	Made to eat her own liver, fed slowly through a tree chipper, roasted and served on a bed of Belgian endive.
64	00:03:13	00:03:18	When Weatherly Adams dies, it's money in the bank.
65	00:03:18	00:03:20	Here you are, gentlemen.
66	00:03:20	00:03:27	Looks like somebody broke the glass, reached in, unlocked it and opened it.
67	00:03:27	00:03:31	Yeah, that's the way I found it when I got here this evening.
68	00:03:49	00:03:52	Uh, Jim...
69	00:03:52	00:03:57	I got her.
70	00:04:01	00:04:04	And I believe she's died for the last time.
71	00:04:10	00:04:13	and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
72	00:04:41	00:04:45	Whoever stuck her under this poster was trying to send a twisted message.
73	00:04:45	00:04:47	Either that, or the killer's got a wicked sense of humor.
74	00:04:51	00:04:57	Lividity is fixed along the anterior aspect, and...
75	00:04:57	00:04:59	she is still in full rigor.
76	00:04:59	00:05:03	She was last seen alive about 15 hours ago.
77	00:05:03	00:05:05	No panties.
78	00:05:05	00:05:07	I'll do an S.A.E. kit.
79	00:05:09	00:05:10	The horror.
80	00:05:12	00:05:13	The horror...
81	00:05:13	00:05:15	Huh?
82	00:05:15	00:05:17	Bra-Brando?
83	00:05:17	00:05:19	Brando from Apocalypse Now?
84	00:05:19	00:05:21	Oh, yeah, yeah. I know, Dave.
85	00:05:21	00:05:22	Everybody knows that.
86	00:05:22	00:05:27	Oh. I'll get the gurney.
87	00:05:31	00:05:35	Looks like the lady lost a heel.
88	00:05:35	00:05:39	There's a whole lot of something here, but it doesn't really look like blood to me.
89	00:05:39	00:05:43	No, it's, uh, it's the wrong color.
90	00:05:43	00:05:45	It's too red.
91	00:05:45	00:05:48	Smells sweet.
92	00:05:48	00:05:52	Karo syrup and food coloring-- it's prop blood.
93	00:05:52	00:05:54	And I am not seeing any prints.
94	00:05:54	00:05:56	It's been wiped clean.
95	00:05:56	00:06:01	The question is, where does the fake blood end and the real blood begin?
96	00:06:06	00:06:12	Now, I know this may come as a shock to most of you, and I'm sorry for your loss.
97	00:06:12	00:06:18	I understand that Weatherly Adams was a long-time member of this company... Well, do you have a suspect?
98	00:06:18	00:06:21	Uh, sir, we just found the body about an hour ago.
99	00:06:22	00:06:24	We're just beginning our investigation.
100	00:06:24	00:06:25	Yeah, I get it, I get it. I mean, it could be anyone.
101	00:06:26	00:06:32	Now, I'm going to have to look at your IDs and I'm going to take statements and fingerprints from all of you.
102	00:06:32	00:06:34	And I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
103	00:06:34	00:06:36	Anything we can do to help.
104	00:06:36	00:06:39	So what am I supposed to do today? Edit.
105	00:06:39	00:06:41	Excuse me, Mr. Brass.
106	00:06:41	00:06:45	Do you think that it would be all right if we were to... continue to shoot...
107	00:06:45	00:06:46	No.
108	00:06:47	00:06:49	I want that little twerp Zarco found and locked up.
109	00:06:49	00:06:50	Uh, who are you?
110	00:06:50	00:06:52	Vincent Lafoon. This is my brother Mason.
111	00:06:52	00:06:53	We own this place.
112	00:06:53	00:06:54	Who's Zarco?
113	00:06:54	00:06:56	Oliver Zarco. He used to work here.
114	00:06:56	00:07:01	He had a thing for Weatherly, and then he got hurt, blamed it on us, went a little nuts.
115	00:07:01	00:07:02	He was the one who got...
116	00:07:03	00:07:04	He was the one who sent the flowers and the note.
117	00:07:04	00:07:06	So he's done this before.
118	00:07:06	00:07:08	Yeah, like, three times. Would you shut it?
119	00:07:08	00:07:10	Three times. He's your guy.
120	00:07:11	00:07:13	Do you have video surveillance by any chance?
121	00:07:13	00:07:16	Yeah, only on the exterior, but the video system's been on the fritz lately.
122	00:07:16	00:07:18	I had it repaired three days ago-- I'll get the tapes.
123	00:07:19	00:07:20	Oh, good.
124	00:07:20	00:07:23	Look, just find Zarco, okay?
125	00:07:23	00:07:25	Everyone, come together.
126	00:07:25	00:07:27	Um, I can't, I still can't believe she's gone.
127	00:07:27	00:07:31	I mean... she was a... she was a real beautiful lady.
128	00:07:31	00:07:36	Let's form a circle and touch hands with someone you care about.
129	00:07:36	00:07:45	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
130	00:07:45	00:07:49	Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me...
131	00:08:53	00:08:55	How's it going in here?
132	00:08:55	00:08:57	The vase is clean.
133	00:08:57	00:09:01	I've got a spiral notebook filled with dates, times and weights.
134	00:09:01	00:09:04	Looks like she was a bit concerned about her size.
135	00:09:06	00:09:07	Actors.
136	00:09:09	00:09:12	You really don't recognize her?
137	00:09:12	00:09:13	No.
138	00:09:13	00:09:15	You've ever seen Chop Chop, Fizz Fizz?
139	00:09:15	00:09:16	No.
140	00:09:16	00:09:18	Can I Lick The Spoon? Please, David.
141	00:09:18	00:09:19	They're classics.
142	00:09:19	00:09:21	Those are not classics. (grunts)
143	00:09:23	00:09:25	The Exorcist. The Shining.
144	00:09:25	00:09:26	Rosemary's Baby.
145	00:09:26	00:09:28	Those are classics.
146	00:09:28	00:09:30	You know what I loved about her?
147	00:09:30	00:09:33	She really made you feel the terror.
148	00:09:33	00:09:38	When she was scared for her life, I was scared, too.
149	00:09:41	00:09:44	Interesting.
150	00:09:46	00:09:48	Mr. Zarco...
151	00:09:48	00:09:52	tell me about you and Weatherly Adams.
152	00:09:52	00:09:56	It was the happiest time in my life.
153	00:09:56	00:09:58	I had realized my dream.
154	00:09:58	00:10:00	I was working in the movies.
155	00:10:00	00:10:05	Though I was only in an entry-level position, Weatherly and I were already an item.
156	00:10:05	00:10:07	Just like...
157	00:10:07	00:10:10	Julia Roberts and what's his name.
158	00:10:13	00:10:15	We were in love.
159	00:10:18	00:10:22	And then it was all over in an instant.
160	00:10:24	00:10:25	Oh, God! (screams)
161	00:10:26	00:10:28	Oh, my God!
162	00:10:28	00:10:33	I was in rehab for six months.
163	00:10:33	00:10:37	That slime ball Lafoon convinced me not to file a Worker's Compensation claim.
164	00:10:38	00:10:40	He said that he'd take care of me.
165	00:10:40	00:10:41	And you trusted him?
166	00:10:41	00:10:51	Yes. And then, when the deadline passed to file my claim, Vincent offered me two grand, take it or leave it, and then he fired my ass.
167	00:10:51	00:10:54	And I could have lived with that, but...
168	00:10:54	00:10:56	But what?
169	00:10:58	00:11:01	Weatherly...
170	00:11:01	00:11:03	dumped me.
171	00:11:03	00:11:07	She felt we were no longer compatible.
172	00:11:07	00:11:12	The truth was, she couldn't stand to look at me.
173	00:11:12	00:11:14	She cried when she told me.
174	00:11:14	00:11:17	Actresses can do that.
175	00:11:17	00:11:21	The smell of her skin...
176	00:11:21	00:11:25	like fresh lemon poppy seed scones baking in the oven.
177	00:11:27	00:11:32	Gold flecks that danced like Valkyries in the emerald depths of her eyes.
178	00:11:32	00:11:33	Her hair-- oh, God...
179	00:11:33	00:11:35	Her hair...
180	00:11:35	00:11:37	So you started stalking her.
181	00:11:38	00:11:43	I brought her gifts from time to time, to let her know that I still loved her.
182	00:11:43	00:11:44	Is that against the law?
183	00:11:44	00:11:46	It is if you break in to do it.
184	00:11:46	00:11:48	They wouldn't let me in the front door.
185	00:11:48	00:11:50	So you came in through the window.
186	00:11:50	00:11:52	Only this time, you got caught.
187	00:11:52	00:11:59	You argued. She told you where to shove your flowers, and you thought to yourself, You know, do I really need this aggravation?
188	00:11:59	00:12:01	So you killed the bitch.
189	00:12:01	00:12:04	I think you killed the bitch.
190	00:12:04	00:12:05	Why would I kill her?
191	00:12:05	00:12:07	How should I know? Do I know you?
192	00:12:07	00:12:10	Listen, Zarco, you whack job, you'd better focus!
193	00:12:10	00:12:11	You focus. I'm trying to explain to you.
194	00:12:11	00:12:13	I haven't been near that place in over a year.
195	00:12:14	00:12:15	You got the wrong guy.
196	00:12:15	00:12:17	I don't do that anymore. I'm in therapy now.
197	00:12:17	00:12:19	Lots of therapy.
198	00:12:19	00:12:23	Freudian, Jungian, Gestaltian-- all that crap.
199	00:12:23	00:12:26	I've let go of my anger.
200	00:12:27	00:12:29	Have you seen Catherine around?
201	00:12:29	00:12:30	No, why?
202	00:12:30	00:12:38	'Cause I just got the DNA results for Weatherly Adams, and the skin under her nails and the semen from her S.A.E., they both belong to Vaughn Krunty. Who?
203	00:12:38	00:12:40	Vaughn Krunty, aka Zack Putrid.
204	00:12:40	00:12:42	Who's that?
205	00:12:42	00:12:44	The Titan of Terror, the Sultan of Slash.
206	00:12:44	00:12:46	He's the movie director.
207	00:12:46	00:12:51	I just... I found him in CODIS for a statutory rape charge in Laughlin when he was 18 and the girl was 16. Can you believe that?
208	00:12:51	00:12:53	What's the matter with you?
209	00:12:53	00:12:55	Nothing.
210	00:12:55	00:13:01	Go tell Catherine what you found, make sure that you pull all the old evidence out of storage in case she needs it.
211	00:13:01	00:13:03	Okay.
212	00:13:13	00:13:15	(scoffs) Please.
213	00:13:15	00:13:18	That looks pretty stupid, doesn't it?
214	00:13:18	00:13:25	Well, you could cut out earlier, maybe go to a wide exterior shot, you could carry the scream over a big flock of birds taking off.
215	00:13:26	00:13:27	Yeah?
216	00:13:27	00:13:30	Or... yeah...
217	00:13:30	00:13:32	Or not. Or not, just...
218	00:13:32	00:13:35	Bad idea. All right, okay.
219	00:13:37	00:13:39	Detective Brass.
220	00:13:39	00:13:41	Man, I love that.
221	00:13:41	00:13:42	Detective Brass.
222	00:13:43	00:13:45	You're a detective, and your name is Brass.
223	00:13:45	00:13:46	I can use that.
224	00:13:46	00:13:49	That's like a cop named Officer Copper.
225	00:13:49	00:13:52	Or a tin horn sheriff named Sheriff Tin.
226	00:13:52	00:13:55	You cannot write that stuff. Listen, buddy...
227	00:13:55	00:13:57	Dude, I know why you're here, okay?
228	00:13:57	00:13:59	Weatherly and I, yes, we were knocking boots, man.
229	00:13:59	00:14:01	So, you acknowledge having sex with her?
230	00:14:01	00:14:04	Well, yeah, I just said I had sex...
231	00:14:04	00:14:05	Why would I deny it?
232	00:14:05	00:14:08	Hey, I bang all my stars.
233	00:14:08	00:14:09	It builds trust.
234	00:14:09	00:14:12	It's part of my process.
235	00:14:12	00:14:14	We found traces of your skin under her fingernails.
236	00:14:14	00:14:17	Maybe she wasn't into your process, so you raped her.
237	00:14:19	00:14:21	You find that funny?
238	00:14:21	00:14:23	Dude, you gotta see this.
239	00:14:23	00:14:24	You're gonna love it. Bring up Double D.
240	00:14:24	00:14:25	Yeah.
241	00:14:26	00:14:27	Here goes.
242	00:14:27	00:14:30	Hi, baby. Hi. (man laughing)
243	00:14:30	00:14:32	Check it out.
244	00:14:32	00:14:34	Money. Money.
245	00:14:34	00:14:36	Oh, yeah.
246	00:14:36	00:14:37	You're a star.
247	00:14:37	00:14:39	I can't believe this is my life.
248	00:14:39	00:14:41	Oh, man, oh, man...
249	00:14:41	00:14:44	Come over here, baby.
250	00:14:44	00:14:45	(sighs) Okay.
251	00:14:48	00:14:50	This what you do all day?
252	00:14:50	00:14:53	Does that look like a woman being taken against her will?
253	00:14:53	00:14:56	That still doesn't explain how your skin got under her fingernails.
254	00:14:56	00:14:59	Weatherly was...
255	00:14:59	00:15:00	how can I put this delicately?
256	00:15:00	00:15:02	She was an ass-scratcher, man.
257	00:15:02	00:15:05	She liked to scratch my ass.
258	00:15:05	00:15:09	She wasn't pushing me away, man, she was pulling me in.
259	00:15:10	00:15:12	Brass, look at my ass.
260	00:15:12	00:15:13	Freaking claw marks.
261	00:15:13	00:15:17	Are you trying to make me throw up, Mr. Putrid?
262	00:16:10	00:16:11	Oh, my God.
263	00:16:11	00:16:14	How awesome.
264	00:16:14	00:16:18	That is so cool. I can't believe you worked for Repulsion Pictures.
265	00:16:18	00:16:23	Well, I did it on a whim. I was supposed to be an extra, but then they liked me, so they gave me this whole featured bit.
266	00:16:23	00:16:25	I got 600 bucks for that. What?
267	00:16:25	00:16:27	What? I was fresh out of college.
268	00:16:27	00:16:28	I really needed the money.
269	00:16:28	00:16:30	I don't get it-- what's the thrill here?
270	00:16:30	00:16:34	It's always hot babes with huge breasts falling out of their shirts, getting hacked up...
271	00:16:34	00:16:38	I don't have huge breasts. Mine are kind of... medium.
272	00:16:38	00:16:39	But perfect...
273	00:16:40	00:16:43	...ly adequate.
274	00:16:43	00:16:45	Better, in fact.
275	00:16:45	00:16:46	Okay.
276	00:16:46	00:16:48	Uh, I'm out of here.
277	00:16:48	00:16:49	Hey, let's watch it again.
278	00:16:51	00:17:02	When I removed the axe, I noticed that the dermis along the margin of the wound showed no vital response, except in a small area on both sides of the center of the track.
279	00:17:02	00:17:06	The cause of death was perforation of the liver, spleen, and pancreas.
280	00:17:06	00:17:11	But the injuries are inconsistent with the position of the axe wound.
281	00:17:11	00:17:13	The axe isn't what killed her.
282	00:17:13	00:17:22	Exactly. The perforation was caused by a sharp, hollow, cylindrical object entering through the lower back, and then passing upwards into the organs.
283	00:17:22	00:17:25	Like a spear, or a pipe of some kind?
284	00:17:25	00:17:27	Perhaps.
285	00:17:27	00:17:32	If the axe was planted in her back postmortem to conceal the original puncture site, then...
286	00:17:32	00:17:34	we don't have a murder weapon.
287	00:17:34	00:17:39	The only thing I found on the surveillance tapes was this.
288	00:17:39	00:17:41	That guy looks familiar.
289	00:17:43	00:17:45	Oh, that's Vincent Lafoon.
290	00:17:45	00:17:46	He and his brother own the place.
291	00:17:47	00:17:50	Well, here's where it gets a little weird.
292	00:17:51	00:17:54	He's trying to make it look like somebody broke in.
293	00:17:54	00:17:57	I think he's framing Zarco.
294	00:17:57	00:18:00	If he owns the place, he must have known about the surveillance cameras.
295	00:18:00	00:18:04	Right? Why would he let himself get caught on tape?
296	00:18:04	00:18:08	I don't know, but according to Brass' notes, he thought the system was down.
297	00:18:08	00:18:13	So, we found no physical evidence linking Zarco to the scene.
298	00:18:13	00:18:15	Vincent knew he had an easy fall guy.
299	00:18:15	00:18:17	He's been playing us the whole time.
300	00:18:21	00:18:25	Hey, you're making a big mistake; you got the wrong dude.
301	00:18:25	00:18:27	Yeah, a lot of guys tell me that.
302	00:18:27	00:18:30	But I didn't do anything. Why would I kill Weatherly?
303	00:18:30	00:18:32	She was my company's best asset. Plus, I liked her.
304	00:18:32	00:18:35	She was my friend.
305	00:18:36	00:18:38	That's him. That's Zarco. That's your guy.
306	00:18:38	00:18:39	What happened, Lafoon?
307	00:18:39	00:18:42	She get too old, so you killed her for real?
308	00:18:42	00:18:44	Where's he going?
309	00:18:44	00:18:46	I don't know. Probably out for a nice dinner.
310	00:18:46	00:18:47	You're letting him go?
311	00:18:47	00:18:48	Are you out of your mind?
312	00:18:48	00:18:49	We've got nothing on him.
313	00:18:50	00:18:51	But I'm the one getting set up here, me!
314	00:18:52	00:18:54	Don't let him go-- I'm telling you-- you'll regret this.
315	00:18:54	00:18:57	I never touched her. You know it, I know it, and they know it.
316	00:18:57	00:18:59	You killed her, and you're going down.
317	00:19:04	00:19:06	Can I go now?
318	00:19:06	00:19:09	Yeah, get out of here while I'm still in a good mood.
319	00:19:09	00:19:10	So long, Lafoon.
320	00:19:10	00:19:13	I hope they tear you a big one.
321	00:19:22	00:19:23	What's up?
322	00:19:27	00:19:34	You know, in the slasher movies, when they go after the dark-haired girl, she always dies?
323	00:19:34	00:19:39	Yeah. And the blond always lives.
324	00:19:39	00:19:43	Aren't you glad it wasn't a movie?
325	00:19:49	00:19:52	I think, um...
326	00:19:52	00:19:57	I think I am sick of having my face shoved in death every day.
327	00:19:57	00:20:01	The murder rate has gone up every year since I've been here.
328	00:20:01	00:20:05	It's totally out of control, and...
329	00:20:05	00:20:09	we're not even slowing them down.
330	00:20:09	00:20:17	After examining the crime scene, I determined there were between 200 and 300 milliliters-- that's less than a cup-- of Weatherly's actual blood outside of her body.
331	00:20:17	00:20:23	Originally, we had assumed that the axe blade had sealed the wound, that the position of her body had caused her to bleed internally.
332	00:20:23	00:20:28	But if she had been gored first by another weapon and then axed, there would have been a lot more blood.
333	00:20:28	00:20:35	Right, right. So, I compared the initial coroner's report with the last entry in her weight loss journal-- which was taken no more than an hour or two before her death.
334	00:20:35	00:20:36	And guess what?
335	00:20:37	00:20:38	Her body came up light?
336	00:20:39	00:20:40	Six pounds light.
337	00:20:40	00:20:45	That's six pints of blood at a pound each nowhere in or around the body.
338	00:20:45	00:20:47	She was moved.
339	00:20:50	00:20:52	Hey.
340	00:20:52	00:20:54	The trace from the puncture wound came back.
341	00:20:54	00:21:01	It's zinc, which is electrically coated onto steel to make galvanized pipe.
342	00:21:01	00:21:06	Well, we should go back, expand the search perimeter, try to find the actual murder site.
343	00:21:06	00:21:07	Okay. I'll get a hold to Swing.
344	00:21:07	00:21:09	We're going to need some help.
345	00:21:09	00:21:10	Okay.
346	00:21:26	00:21:30	I heard you're holding Vincent Lafoon on suspicion of murder.
347	00:21:30	00:21:31	His lawyer called me.
348	00:21:32	00:21:33	I'd be surprised.
349	00:21:33	00:21:38	Yes, the guy is a bit rough around the edges, but I don't think that he, uh...
350	00:21:40	00:21:41	Hello.
351	00:21:45	00:21:47	Nick.
352	00:21:47	00:21:52	Why don't you, uh, take the offices, and Ronnie and I will start in the storage area.
353	00:21:52	00:21:55	My name is Stanley.
354	00:21:55	00:21:58	But you call me Stan.
355	00:23:01	00:23:04	Hey. Hey, Nicky, what do you got?
356	00:23:04	00:23:07	I've got the hat Lafoon was wearing in the surveillance video.
357	00:23:07	00:23:14	The wear on the strap indicates that's it's been set larger... like it was adjusted for somebody with a bigger head or something.
358	00:23:14	00:23:18	So I'm going to get it back, see if I can get some prints off it.
359	00:23:18	00:23:21	Okay, I'll, uh, meet you back at the lab.
360	00:23:25	00:23:27	Howdy.
361	00:23:27	00:23:31	Dickie Jones. And you are?
362	00:23:31	00:23:33	Busy.
363	00:23:33	00:23:36	How about after your shift, I take you out for a cup of coffee?
364	00:23:36	00:23:39	And I could tell you my whole life story.
365	00:23:40	00:23:41	No, thanks.
366	00:23:41	00:23:44	It's just a cup of coffee, doll.
367	00:23:44	00:23:46	I'm not asking you to make love.
368	00:23:49	00:23:52	Not right away, anyway.
369	00:23:52	00:23:55	You know, I could open up new worlds to you.
370	00:23:55	00:23:59	Have you ever had the back of those thighs kissed by a man... who's standing up?
371	00:24:02	00:24:04	So you find dwarves funny?
372	00:24:05	00:24:07	Sometimes, yeah.
373	00:24:07	00:24:09	Come on, what do you say?
374	00:24:09	00:24:10	Is it because of my receding hairline?
375	00:24:12	00:24:16	I don't go out with persons of interest in an ongoing investigation.
376	00:24:16	00:24:20	Well, I just think you might be missing out, Pookie.
377	00:24:21	00:24:23	Don't call me Pookie.
378	00:24:24	00:24:27	But you haven't told me your name.
379	00:24:27	00:24:28	Catherine.
380	00:24:28	00:24:31	Catherine. Catherine.
381	00:24:31	00:24:33	Catherine.
382	00:24:33	00:24:42	Well, Catherine, we little people see things from a different perspective-- things other people might miss.
383	00:24:44	00:24:55	If you're implying that you know something about Weatherly's death, and you're not giving it up, that makes you, at a minimum, an accessory after the fact, and that buys a long stretch for a stubby guy.
384	00:24:55	00:24:57	I'm just talking, doll-face.
385	00:24:57	00:24:59	Dickie.
386	00:24:59	00:25:01	Why don't we leave the nice woman alone to do her work?
387	00:25:01	00:25:03	Here's my card.
388	00:25:03	00:25:08	If there's anything that you want to tell me as it pertains to the case...
389	00:25:08	00:25:09	uh, call me.
390	00:26:22	00:26:27	Hey, Archie, could you bring up the surveillance video from Repulsion Pictures, please?
391	00:26:27	00:26:29	Yeah, got it over here.
392	00:26:38	00:26:41	What's the best you can get me on the face?
393	00:26:45	00:26:50	He seems to be deliberately looking away from the camera.
394	00:26:50	00:26:52	Take him to the window.
395	00:26:53	00:26:56	(computer whirs) Freeze that.
396	00:26:57	00:26:58	Zoom in on the sleeve.
397	00:27:00	00:27:03	Does that jacket look a little small for that guy to you?
398	00:27:03	00:27:04	Maybe.
399	00:27:04	00:27:06	I measured the height of the window.
400	00:27:06	00:27:07	It's five feet.
401	00:27:07	00:27:09	How tall is the guy?
402	00:27:11	00:27:14	Well, he's a head taller than that window.
403	00:27:14	00:27:15	Vincent Lafoon's only five-foot-ten.
404	00:27:15	00:27:19	This guy's six-foot-two, six-foot-three, easy.
405	00:27:19	00:27:21	And a lot rounder.
406	00:27:21	00:27:24	The only guy that big in the bunch is Mason.
407	00:27:24	00:27:26	Catherine, it's Nick.
408	00:27:26	00:27:28	Listen, the surveillance video footage is a fake.
409	00:27:28	00:27:31	I think we got the wrong brother in custody.
410	00:27:31	00:27:33	I think Mason set up Vincent to set Oliver up.
411	00:27:33	00:27:36	It's getting complicated.
412	00:27:55	00:27:57	Hey, Ronnie, anything?
413	00:27:57	00:28:00	No.
414	00:28:01	00:28:04	This place is creeping me out.
415	00:28:04	00:28:06	It's supposed to.
416	00:29:09	00:29:11	I think we just found our murder weapon.
417	00:29:11	00:29:13	Hidden in plain sight.
418	00:29:23	00:29:25	Catherine?
419	00:29:26	00:29:29	I've got something else here.
420	00:29:35	00:29:37	Looks like Weatherly's missing heel.
421	00:29:43	00:29:46	This is where she died.
422	00:29:52	00:29:53	Ah, damn.
423	00:29:53	00:29:55	Oh, good.
424	00:29:55	00:29:59	Auxiliary generator just kicked in.
425	00:29:59	00:30:01	And I don't have any service.
426	00:30:03	00:30:06	Mine's dead, too.
427	00:30:06	00:30:08	I'm going to get a dolly for you to move this thing.
428	00:30:09	00:30:11	Photo it and get it back to the lab.
429	00:30:11	00:30:14	Okay.
430	00:30:52	00:30:54	Can you help?
431	00:30:54	00:30:56	Thanks.
432	00:31:06	00:31:08	Damn it.
433	00:31:14	00:31:17	Control, this is C-147 Lake for C13 Willows.
434	00:31:17	00:31:19	Copy, C-147.
435	00:31:19	00:31:21	Stand by.
436	00:31:21	00:31:23	C-147, you have C-13. Over.
437	00:31:24	00:31:25	This is Catherine.
438	00:31:25	00:31:28	Hey, Catherine, I left my cell phone at the studio.
439	00:31:28	00:31:30	I need to go back and get it.
440	00:31:30	00:31:31	Yeah, you'd better.
441	00:31:31	00:31:32	They're department issue.
442	00:31:32	00:31:34	And if you lose it, you replace it.
443	00:31:34	00:31:36	Does that include the cost of the contract?
444	00:31:36	00:31:38	Oh, yeah.
445	00:31:38	00:31:39	Damn.
446	00:31:39	00:31:41	I'll see you later.
447	00:32:08	00:32:09	We found the pipe that killed Weatherly.
448	00:32:10	00:32:11	It's in the print lab being processed.
449	00:32:11	00:32:14	She was killed on the soundstage and then dragged over.
450	00:32:14	00:32:16	We've got a warrant out for Mason Lafoon.
451	00:32:16	00:32:17	We're looking for him now.
452	00:32:17	00:32:18	Okay. let me know what you find out.
453	00:32:24	00:32:26	What do you want?
454	00:32:26	00:32:28	Pookie, it's me, Dickie. I know.
455	00:32:28	00:32:31	I've got information I think you might be interested in.
456	00:32:31	00:32:32	Okay, shoot.
457	00:32:32	00:32:34	No. It has to be in person.
458	00:32:34	00:32:35	Where are you?
459	00:32:35	00:32:37	I'm at the studio.
460	00:32:37	00:32:40	I thought there was no phone transmission from there.
461	00:32:40	00:32:41	There wasn't. Now there is.
462	00:32:41	00:32:43	That's how it is with phones and electrical storms.
463	00:32:43	00:32:44	Look, it's urgent.
464	00:32:45	00:32:46	Get here as soon as you can.
465	00:32:46	00:32:47	I just came from there.
466	00:32:47	00:32:50	Why didn't you tell me then, you annoying little man?
467	00:32:50	00:32:53	The situation is evolving.
468	00:32:53	00:32:57	If you're screwing with me, I will to string you up and beat you senseless.
469	00:32:57	00:32:59	I look forward to it.
470	00:32:59	00:33:01	Just hurry.
471	00:33:03	00:33:05	That's you, Mason.
472	00:33:05	00:33:11	All six feet, three inches of you impersonating your brother, which makes you good for Weatherly's murder.
473	00:33:11	00:33:13	You did that one, too, didn't you? No, no, no.
474	00:33:13	00:33:14	Nobody killed Weatherly, okay?
475	00:33:14	00:33:16	She killed herself. Oh, really?
476	00:33:16	00:33:17	What, she axed herself in the back?
477	00:33:17	00:33:18	No, you don't understand.
478	00:33:18	00:33:20	She... she... It was an accident.
479	00:33:20	00:33:21	She tripped.
480	00:33:21	00:33:23	Good night, Weatherly.
481	00:33:23	00:33:24	Good night, kid. Yeah, great stuff tonight.
482	00:33:24	00:33:25	Have a good night. See you tomorrow.
483	00:33:25	00:33:27	See you tomorrow. Okay.
484	00:33:27	00:33:28	Whoa, ah!
485	00:33:36	00:33:37	Call 911!
486	00:33:37	00:33:38	Call 911!
487	00:33:38	00:33:39	Wait, let's think about this.
488	00:33:39	00:33:40	No, but Stanley... Mason, she's dead!
489	00:33:40	00:33:42	This time she's not coming back.
490	00:33:42	00:33:44	We've got so many health and safety violations.
491	00:33:44	00:33:55	If we report one more set-related accident-- especially one resulting in a death-- we will lose our bond, our liability insurance, OSHA will shut us down, we'll get our asses sued for wrongful death, and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures!
492	00:33:55	00:33:56	Is that what you want?
493	00:33:56	00:33:58	Is that what you want?!
494	00:33:58	00:33:59	No!
495	00:33:59	00:34:05	He... he said the show must go on, th-that Weatherly... would have wanted it that...
496	00:34:05	00:34:06	I don't...
497	00:34:06	00:34:08	We... we didn't kill anybody.
498	00:34:08	00:34:10	But you made it look like a murder, and then you framed your brother.
499	00:34:10	00:34:14	Well, he's been treating me like crap my entire life.
500	00:34:16	00:34:20	Yeah, but for that, you're going to send him to jail for the rest of his life?
501	00:34:20	00:34:23	This was all... this was all Stanley's idea.
502	00:34:23	00:34:25	Do you realize how much trouble you're in?
503	00:34:25	00:34:29	Look, Stanley was the one who wanted to frame Vincent, okay?
504	00:34:30	00:34:36	All I was supposed to do was clean up the accident scene and pretend to be Vince and buy the roses and that was it.
505	00:34:36	00:34:37	The rest was him.
506	00:34:37	00:34:40	If you don't believe me, talk to the dwarf.
507	00:34:43	00:34:45	Why? What did he have to do with it?
508	00:34:45	00:34:47	Dickie saw the whole thing.
509	00:34:47	00:34:50	...and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures.
510	00:34:50	00:34:51	Is that what you want?
511	00:34:51	00:34:53	Is that what you want?! No!
512	00:34:53	00:34:56	And he's been trying to shake down Stanley ever since.
513	00:34:56	00:34:59	Well, that would explain the animosity.
514	00:35:47	00:35:52	Control, this is C-13 Willows, trying to contact C-147 Lake.
515	00:35:52	00:35:55	C-13, Control. Copy. Stand by.
516	00:35:57	00:35:59	Hello, Dispatch?
517	00:36:02	00:36:04	Hello?
518	00:36:04	00:36:08	C-13, Control. C-147 is not responding.
519	00:36:08	00:36:11	Okay, thanks. Over and out.
520	00:36:58	00:37:00	Catherine, it's Ronnie.
521	00:37:00	00:37:02	I'm stuck at Repulsion Pictures.
522	00:37:02	00:37:03	I need backup.
523	00:37:03	00:37:06	Ronnie... uh, I'm, I'm coming.
524	00:37:06	00:37:09	Just... just stay on the line.
525	00:37:09	00:37:11	Ronnie?
526	00:37:12	00:37:14	Ronnie!
527	00:37:14	00:37:16	Hello?
528	00:37:18	00:37:23	Dispatch, this is C-13 Willows requesting backup to meet me at Repulsion Pictures.
529	00:37:54	00:37:56	You gotta help me.
530	00:37:56	00:37:57	I'm shot! I'm shot!
531	00:37:57	00:37:59	You gotta get us out of here.
532	00:37:59	00:38:01	It's gonna be okay. Keep your voice down.
533	00:38:02	00:38:05	Do you know how many people I've killed in this place?
534	00:38:05	00:38:06	Shh!
535	00:38:06	00:38:10	The irony is exquisite, but the pain is more formidable, you know?
536	00:38:11	00:38:14	I think the pain is preventing me from enjoying the irony.
537	00:38:14	00:38:15	Shh!
538	00:38:15	00:38:16	Shut up!
539	00:38:16	00:38:18	But I...
540	00:38:18	00:38:21	For the love of God, stop talking.
541	00:38:29	00:38:31	Oh, that's not good.
542	00:38:32	00:38:36	I should really stop talking and-and try and relax.
543	00:38:36	00:38:38	That's good. Yeah, stop talking.
544	00:38:38	00:38:39	But I can't stop talking.
545	00:38:39	00:38:41	I've got that thing that...
546	00:38:41	00:38:43	It's a syndrome.
547	00:38:43	00:38:44	It's a word... There's a word for it.
548	00:38:44	00:38:45	Shh-shh-shh!
549	00:38:45	00:38:47	People have it. It's a syndrome.
550	00:38:47	00:38:48	I can't stop talking.
551	00:38:48	00:38:50	Zack.
552	00:38:56	00:38:58	Stanley...
553	00:38:58	00:39:00	Stanley, don't shoot me again.
554	00:39:00	00:39:01	I don't want to die, okay?
555	00:39:01	00:39:03	You already shot me twice.
556	00:39:03	00:39:05	I learned my lesson, okay?
557	00:39:05	00:39:08	Sir, I'm a CSI.
558	00:39:08	00:39:10	Think about what you're doing.
559	00:39:12	00:39:13	Put down your weapon.
560	00:39:13	00:39:16	I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that.
561	00:39:39	00:39:41	Are you okay?
562	00:39:43	00:39:44	Yeah.
563	00:40:01	00:40:03	I really loved her.
564	00:40:29	00:40:34	I'm editing late, like I always do, and I hear a shot.
565	00:40:37	00:40:39	So, I go outside and check it out.
566	00:40:47	00:40:49	Stanley!
567	00:40:49	00:40:52	You gotta help me hide the dwarf before the cops come back.
568	00:40:52	00:40:55	Dickie was blackmailing us about Weatherly's accident.
569	00:40:55	00:40:56	He wants to bring the whole company down.
570	00:40:56	00:40:58	But you killed him!
571	00:40:58	00:40:59	You killed Dickie!
572	00:40:59	00:41:00	What's it gonna be, Zack?
573	00:41:00	00:41:02	You gonna help me here or what?!
574	00:41:02	00:41:04	Next thing you know, I'm running for my life.
575	00:41:04	00:41:06	And the nut job is chasing me.
576	00:41:06	00:41:09	He shoots me, and then I see the hot...
577	00:41:09	00:41:11	you.
578	00:41:11	00:41:14	And all I can think the whole time is, Man, this is great.
579	00:41:14	00:41:17	I could use this stuff.
580	00:41:17	00:41:20	I mean, this is life imitating art imitating life.
581	00:41:21	00:41:22	You are so beautiful.
582	00:41:22	00:41:25	You are... Your, your face is so expressive.
583	00:41:25	00:41:27	It-it emotes.
584	00:41:27	00:41:29	You do terror so good.
585	00:41:29	00:41:31	I wasn't acting. I know.
586	00:41:31	00:41:32	I'll see you.
587	00:41:32	00:41:34	Well, hey, listen.
588	00:41:34	00:41:39	If you ever get tired of fighting crime, you know, there's always a future for you in the horror business.
589	00:41:39	00:41:41	I mean, I'll take you there.
590	00:41:41	00:41:43	Thanks, but I like what I'm doing.
591	00:41:43	00:41:45	Oh, hey, the offer's still good.
592	00:41:45	00:41:46	Okay, thanks.
593	00:41:47	00:41:48	No, I'm serious.
594	00:41:48	00:41:49	I could build an entire franchise around you.
595	00:41:49	00:41:50	Bye.
596	00:41:50	00:41:52	Seriously. Give me a call.
597	00:42:12	00:42:14	That is impressive.
598	00:42:14	00:42:20	As the woman's throat is being slashed, you can actually see the entire transverse view of the trachea.
599	00:42:20	00:42:21	That's all you've got to say?
600	00:42:21	00:42:24	I believe I can see the epiglottis.
601	00:42:24	00:42:26	Epiglottis?
602	00:42:26	00:42:27	What about the pathos?
603	00:42:27	00:42:29	I mean... what about the humanity?
604	00:42:29	00:42:33	This may be Weatherly's finest performance.
605	00:42:33	00:42:35	Oh, just watch the movie.
