0	00:00:44	00:00:48	So, Kevin, tell us what you want when you grow up.
1	00:00:51	00:00:56	I want to have so much money, I can't even fit it all in my house.
2	00:00:56	00:00:57	I want my own jet plane.
3	00:00:57	00:00:59	I want a mansion.
4	00:00:59	00:01:04	And I want, like, a whole bunch of really awesome things to play with.
5	00:01:10	00:01:13	Happy birthday, Kevin!
6	00:01:19	00:01:20	Friends...
7	00:01:20	00:01:28	they say the past is prologue, and who would have guessed that that skinny kid would grow into the man standing before you today?
8	00:01:28	00:01:35	Yet beyond the bank account and the billion-push-up body and all of my other extracurricular achievements...
9	00:01:37	00:01:40	...inside, I'm still that ten-year-old boy.
10	00:01:41	00:01:43	And really...
11	00:01:43	00:01:45	aren't we all?
12	00:01:46	00:01:48	Mind if I join the party?
13	00:02:05	00:02:06	Oh, my God!
14	00:02:15	00:02:18	Our battered birthday boy is Kevin Fetzer.
15	00:02:18	00:02:23	It was a private affair-- all the guests are his friends.
16	00:02:23	00:02:26	Well, with a possible exception or two.
17	00:02:26	00:02:28	Foots this bill, a guy's got to have some bucks.
18	00:02:28	00:02:35	Yeah, he was an entrepreneur, started a franchise called Joystick Jungle, something like that.
19	00:02:37	00:02:38	The king of drunken Donkey Kong.
20	00:02:38	00:02:45	Joystick Jungle, it's a video arcade for adults-- pinball, Pac-Man, pizza, lots and lots of booze.
21	00:02:45	00:02:48	Letting intoxicated adults act like little kids.
22	00:02:48	00:02:51	It's a surefire investment.
23	00:02:51	00:02:55	Well... the new American Dream-- perpetual adolescence, right?
24	00:02:55	00:02:58	Maybe that explains the underwear.
25	00:02:58	00:03:00	They're on backwards!
26	00:03:00	00:03:02	Got dressed in a hurry, or drunk?
27	00:03:02	00:03:03	Or...
28	00:03:03	00:03:04	killer put them on him.
29	00:03:04	00:03:06	Wanted to turn him into a...
30	00:03:06	00:03:08	little boy.
31	00:03:08	00:03:10	Specifically...
32	00:03:10	00:03:11	an eight-year-old.
33	00:03:11	00:03:13	Look at this.
34	00:03:13	00:03:20	Gravitational blood drops where the other candles have been deliberately removed.
35	00:03:20	00:03:22	Candles, redressing.
36	00:03:22	00:03:25	Killer took some time.
37	00:03:25	00:03:28	After he took his life.
38	00:04:02	00:04:03	So you're the victim's best friend.
39	00:04:03	00:04:05	When did you last see Kevin?
40	00:04:05	00:04:06	Ten minutes before the big reveal.
41	00:04:06	00:04:09	Said he had to go behind the curtain, light the candles.
42	00:04:09	00:04:11	Anybody go back there with him? No.
43	00:04:11	00:04:13	Kev liked to handle things himself.
44	00:04:13	00:04:15	Little bit of a control freak.
45	00:04:15	00:04:17	Didn't like surprises.
46	00:04:17	00:04:19	Russell.
47	00:04:19	00:04:20	Hey, Doc.
48	00:04:21	00:04:29	When I heard tycoon, I was picturing top hat and monocle, or at least pants.
49	00:04:29	00:04:31	Obvious blunt-force trauma.
50	00:04:32	00:04:35	Oh, he lost his two front teeth.
51	00:04:35	00:04:37	Not so cute at his age.
52	00:04:37	00:04:44	Yeah, I couldn't find any teeth around here, but judging by the medium-velocity sprinkles on the cake, this is where the beating took place.
53	00:04:44	00:04:49	Something's stuck between the cuspid and incisor.
54	00:04:49	00:04:50	Could be dinner.
55	00:04:55	00:04:56	Huh.
56	00:04:58	00:05:02	Surveillance is pretty thin throughout the club, no eyes in this area.
57	00:05:02	00:05:06	The bouncer did say that there was one ugly incident earlier.
58	00:05:06	00:05:09	Kevin got into it with an uninvited guest, had him tossed out.
59	00:05:09	00:05:12	Anyone have a name for this uninvited guest?
60	00:05:12	00:05:15	Kevin called him Dad.
61	00:05:15	00:05:16	Oh.
62	00:05:16	00:05:19	Son gives dad the heave-ho.
63	00:05:19	00:05:24	Maybe dad comes back to remind him who's the grownup.
64	00:05:26	00:05:33	Sure, Doc, take the awesome club scene, classic arcade games, beautiful women...
65	00:05:33	00:05:34	why would I be interested in that?
66	00:05:34	00:05:36	Are you whining? That's not very Super Dave of you.
67	00:05:36	00:05:39	Maybe we should remember that some people have it worse. Yeah.
68	00:05:41	00:05:43	Like this poor John Doe.
69	00:05:49	00:05:52	If there ever was a candidate for stop, drop and roll.
70	00:05:52	00:05:55	Jimmy, let's go. We have work to do.
71	00:05:55	00:05:57	He inhaled fumes at the scene.
72	00:05:57	00:05:59	Mm.
73	00:05:59	00:06:02	Okay, so what's this guy's deal?
74	00:06:02	00:06:06	Officer drove up on a fire blazing, open end of an alley, found him.
75	00:06:06	00:06:09	Burning tire around the body probably slipped down from his throat.
76	00:06:09	00:06:14	Necklacing-- South African thugs and cartels south of the border both do this.
77	00:06:14	00:06:16	It's sad the things that the world can agree on.
78	00:06:16	00:06:18	Not good seeing this in Vegas.
79	00:06:18	00:06:20	Same principle as being burned at the stake.
80	00:06:23	00:06:27	Takes a while for the CO and the smoke inhalation to kill you.
81	00:06:27	00:06:29	Until then, hell on earth.
82	00:06:29	00:06:32	Gang neighborhood, Snakebacks versus La Tijeras.
83	00:06:32	00:06:34	Ah, let me guess-- no witnesses.
84	00:06:34	00:06:37	Didn't hear the screaming, didn't even smell the bonfire.
85	00:06:38	00:06:40	These tires are two different treads.
86	00:06:40	00:06:41	They're probably from a junkyard.
87	00:06:41	00:06:42	They're not gonna give us anything.
88	00:06:42	00:06:47	Hope of any trace or prints from the outside of the tires is up in smoke.
89	00:06:47	00:06:48	Well...
90	00:06:48	00:06:50	let's try to get an I.D. on this guy.
91	00:06:50	00:06:52	I say...
92	00:06:52	00:06:54	we strip the Michelin from the man.
93	00:06:56	00:07:01	Well, one C.O.D.-- Cause Of De-pantsing,-- is still a mystery.
94	00:07:01	00:07:03	No evidence of sexual activity.
95	00:07:03	00:07:04	Mm.
96	00:07:04	00:07:07	So the pants around his ankles was more message than make-out.
97	00:07:08	00:07:09	And the other C.O.D.?
98	00:07:09	00:07:12	Asphyxiation via fatal vanity.
99	00:07:12	00:07:16	His two front porcelain veneers were broken and inhaled.
100	00:07:19	00:07:22	Lacerated the bronchi, caused a bronchial spasm.
101	00:07:22	00:07:25	Teeth weren't the only body-mods.
102	00:07:25	00:07:27	Pec implants, hair plugs.
103	00:07:27	00:07:30	Geek makes money, remakes himself.
104	00:07:30	00:07:34	You take your new pride and joy for a spin, inevitably somebody dings it up.
105	00:07:37	00:07:41	Weapon was a round implement, roughly spherical.
106	00:07:41	00:07:43	Didn't find anything like that at the scene.
107	00:07:43	00:07:48	Booze flowing, games blasting, plenty of opportunity for the killer to sneak out with a weapon.
108	00:07:48	00:07:51	You throw a good enough party, people think they can get away with anything.
109	00:07:51	00:07:53	Who do you think you are, Kevin?
110	00:07:53	00:07:56	Think tossing me from your party makes you a man?
111	00:07:56	00:07:59	You're a weak and scared little boy!
112	00:08:01	00:08:03	Not exactly a Hallmark greeting.
113	00:08:05	00:08:08	But then you're not exactly a father, are you, Rick?
114	00:08:08	00:08:15	Abandoned him when he was ten, didn't pay a dime in child support, son of a deadbeat, beat dead.
115	00:08:15	00:08:16	You think I had something to do with that?
116	00:08:16	00:08:20	Well, I think that's a lot of rage to show a half an hour before he was killed.
117	00:08:20	00:08:26	And I think a trucker with a repo'd rig has got nothing to haul but a greedy grudge against his millionaire son.
118	00:08:26	00:08:31	You crash the party, you hit him up, he shoots you down, so you really hit him up.
119	00:08:31	00:08:35	And then you leave him a reminder-- don't get too big for your britches.
120	00:08:44	00:08:48	There was something wrong with him, even when he was little.
121	00:08:48	00:08:50	Sick and twisted little something.
122	00:08:50	00:08:51	The way he'd look at people.
123	00:08:51	00:08:54	As he got older, made you not want to be around him.
124	00:08:56	00:08:58	So I'm not surprised someone would see fit to...
125	00:08:58	00:09:01	beat the hell out of him.
126	00:09:01	00:09:02	Just wasn't me.
127	00:09:02	00:09:06	Well, you got an alibi or just your sunshiny attitude?
128	00:09:06	00:09:12	Soon as he made clear I wasn't getting paid, I left that party.
129	00:09:12	00:09:15	Check the cameras at that casino next to the club.
130	00:09:15	00:09:18	I had better luck yanking those levers.
131	00:09:18	00:09:21	Spun a jackpot, won enough to get my truck back.
132	00:09:24	00:09:27	Happy birthday to me.
133	00:09:31	00:09:34	Unless your birthday vic was part beaver...
134	00:09:34	00:09:37	the weapon was wooden.
135	00:09:37	00:09:40	Trace from his teeth is varnished oak.
136	00:09:40	00:09:42	Baseball bat?
137	00:09:42	00:09:43	Hmm, well...
138	00:09:43	00:09:46	the wounds are spherical, not cylindrical.
139	00:09:46	00:09:53	Rough extrapolation of the curvature, we're looking at something with a diameter of four to five inches?
140	00:09:55	00:09:56	Wooden ball.
141	00:09:57	00:09:58	Arcade tycoon, right?
142	00:09:58	00:10:01	Yeah. Ah...
143	00:10:03	00:10:04	Arcade Bowl Ball.
144	00:10:04	00:10:06	Excuse me?
145	00:10:06	00:10:13	From the classic game of luck and skill beloved by children of all ages-- my guess, that's what bashed your vic's face into a bloody pulp.
146	00:10:13	00:10:18	Arcade Bowl is not one of the games at the club, so the killer would have had to bring the ball in.
147	00:10:18	00:10:20	Making the weapon of choice significant, no?
148	00:10:20	00:10:23	Disgruntled arcade employee.
149	00:10:23	00:10:24	That's a good place to start.
150	00:10:24	00:10:26	Hey, how did swab-a-palooza go?
151	00:10:26	00:10:30	Uh, 200 party guests, all swabbed, printed and checked for spatter, all clean.
152	00:10:30	00:10:33	Well, maybe you'll have more luck at your next case.
153	00:10:33	00:10:37	I want you to restock your kit, and go meet Morgan at the Park Motel.
154	00:10:39	00:10:42	It's a scene, not a date, you wacky kid, you.
155	00:10:44	00:10:49	Hey, I heard you're looking for unhappy arcade clerks who might have played Whack-A-Boss.
156	00:10:49	00:10:51	I didn't find any.
157	00:10:51	00:10:53	And Fetzer's franchises don't carry Arcade Bowl.
158	00:10:53	00:10:58	But the weapon is so unusual that I searched online for any connection between Kevin Fetzer and the game.
159	00:10:58	00:10:59	Check this out.
160	00:11:02	00:11:09	In 1991, an eight-year-old boy named Mikey Moran was celebrating his birthday at an arcade.
161	00:11:09	00:11:10	He goes missing.
162	00:11:10	00:11:12	His body is found behind the place.
163	00:11:12	00:11:13	His pants are off; he's been beaten to death.
164	00:11:13	00:11:17	The weapon, a bloody arcade ball, is lying next to him.
165	00:11:17	00:11:19	Unbelievable.
166	00:11:19	00:11:26	Arcade worker Kevin Fetzer, age 15, said it was a day that nobody in the arcade would ever forget.
167	00:11:26	00:11:30	And guess what acne-faced future millionaire was questioned as a person of interest?
168	00:11:30	00:11:31	Kevin Fetzer.
169	00:11:31	00:11:34	Yeah. I pulled the case file.
170	00:11:34	00:11:36	There was never an arrest made for the boy's murder.
171	00:11:36	00:11:41	Somebody turned Kevin's birthday into his judgment day.
172	00:11:48	00:11:53	Motel guest heard a disturbance, phoned it in, officers responded and found her.
173	00:11:53	00:11:55	Her name's Darlene Crocker.
174	00:11:55	00:11:57	Motel manager said she's been staying here a few weeks.
175	00:11:57	00:12:01	Alone? Not really. She's been known to have various male guests for an hour at a time.
176	00:12:02	00:12:06	But witnesses said nobody left during or after the attack.
177	00:12:06	00:12:07	Snuck out a window...?
178	00:12:07	00:12:10	Huh-- no getting through those bars.
179	00:12:10	00:12:15	Bathroom windows would be tight, even for a lightweight, and this damage is Ali-Foreman.
180	00:12:21	00:12:24	Some sort of crystals-- Cocaine?
181	00:12:24	00:12:26	Maybe meth?
182	00:12:28	00:12:30	Yellow powder near her mouth.
183	00:12:30	00:12:34	I don't think it's drug trace.
184	00:12:34	00:12:40	So... she's using with some lucky man of the hour.
185	00:12:40	00:12:43	Somehow, session goes sideways.
186	00:12:43	00:12:47	And what, he just kills her and leaves without anybody noticing?
187	00:12:47	00:12:51	These punctures have irregular jagged edges.
188	00:12:51	00:12:53	That's inconsistent with a single, sharp blade.
189	00:12:56	00:12:57	Messy stabbing...
190	00:12:57	00:13:01	messy scene...
191	00:13:01	00:13:02	clean getaway.
192	00:13:02	00:13:04	Like the killer just vanished.
193	00:13:08	00:13:10	Bloody Mary.
194	00:13:10	00:13:12	Well, yeah, there's an empty bottle of vodka on the bed.
195	00:13:12	00:13:15	No, not the drink, the ghost.
196	00:13:16	00:13:24	See, you stand in front of a mirror, lights out, you say her name three times...
197	00:13:24	00:13:26	and then she bursts through the glass and kills you.
198	00:13:26	00:13:30	Are we at a crime scene or a seventh-grade sleepover?
199	00:13:41	00:13:43	Just a theory.
200	00:13:46	00:13:51	Someone beat Kevin Fetzer's face in with an arcade ball.
201	00:13:51	00:13:53	There's some justice in that.
202	00:13:53	00:13:58	I've got the case file from the original arcade ball murder-- Mikey Moran-- just to jog your memory.
203	00:13:58	00:14:01	Yeah, that was one of the first murders I ever worked.
204	00:14:01	00:14:05	A scene like that, your memory gets plenty of miles on its own.
205	00:14:08	00:14:10	We found the body behind the arcade.
206	00:14:10	00:14:11	The weapon was right there.
207	00:14:13	00:14:15	And for my money, so was the killer.
208	00:14:16	00:14:20	That Fetzer kid struck me strange the instant I saw him.
209	00:14:20	00:14:25	He's hanging around the scene, and then he leaves for an hour, and comes back carrying two little shoes.
210	00:14:25	00:14:27	Ugh. Mikey's?
211	00:14:27	00:14:29	He said that he found them ditched a half block away.
212	00:14:29	00:14:31	He just happened to be looking over there.
213	00:14:31	00:14:35	But there was no physical evidence found that connected Kevin Fetzer to the crime.
214	00:14:35	00:14:42	Well, we did find a pubic hair on the little boy-- blond, like Fetzer-- but DNA testing was new, and we didn't get a result.
215	00:14:42	00:14:45	And it wasn't re-tested with improved technology?
216	00:14:45	00:14:48	The, uh, sample was consumed on the first test and...
217	00:14:48	00:14:50	that was my call.
218	00:14:50	00:14:51	I was new on the job.
219	00:14:51	00:14:53	I went all in, and I crapped out.
220	00:14:53	00:14:56	That was the first time that I learned that the job isn't fair.
221	00:14:56	00:15:01	You know, you could have the killer standing right in front of you, know that he did it and...
222	00:15:01	00:15:04	you know, it feels like the cuffs are on your own wrists.
223	00:15:04	00:15:06	We've all been there, Lou.
224	00:15:08	00:15:11	So, do you have any suspects on Kevin Fetzer's murder?
225	00:15:11	00:15:15	No. Brass talked to Fetzer's dad, who had an alibi.
226	00:15:15	00:15:17	We got him on casino surveillance.
227	00:15:17	00:15:20	He should be talking to Mikey Moran's family.
228	00:15:20	00:15:26	After what Fetzer did to that little boy, if that were my kid, I wouldn't have waited 20 years.
229	00:15:37	00:15:42	Considering where and how we found him, we figured our John Doe was a Snakeback or a La Tijera.
230	00:15:42	00:15:51	There was nothing to help get more specific, except his arms pinned to his sides left small portions of unburnt flesh and an old battle wound.
231	00:15:54	00:15:56	I've been searching for similar scars in the gang database.
232	00:15:56	00:16:00	Our burning man is a La Tijera named Ramon Castillo, street name Espectro.
233	00:16:00	00:16:02	Yeah, it means Ghost.
234	00:16:02	00:16:04	Big baller with La Tijeras some years back.
235	00:16:04	00:16:07	Made my early days in the gang task force a real joy.
236	00:16:07	00:16:10	Earned you some overtime, did he, Sam?
237	00:16:10	00:16:14	Yeah, he and a Snakeback rival, Diego Barra, they were a regular Itchy and Scratchy.
238	00:16:14	00:16:16	Shots traded back and forth, killing each other's friends.
239	00:16:16	00:16:18	Barra's still on the street? No.
240	00:16:18	00:16:20	Been locked up for almost a decade now.
241	00:16:20	00:16:22	He could have ordered the hit from inside, no?
242	00:16:22	00:16:26	Let's put him on a bus and bring his ass down here and talk to him.
243	00:16:26	00:16:27	How's your Spanish these days?
244	00:16:27	00:16:28	No bueno.
245	00:16:28	00:16:29	But you can help me out there, bud.
246	00:16:29	00:16:31	Tu? Nunca.
247	00:16:31	00:16:32	Vamos.
248	00:16:37	00:16:43	Your motel vic's organs are pale as a result of exsanguination due to severing of the carotid jugular complex.
249	00:16:43	00:16:45	Her throat was slashed.
250	00:16:45	00:16:46	Someone did a number on her.
251	00:16:46	00:16:48	Hello.
252	00:16:48	00:16:52	Maybe Darlene Crocker looked her killer in the eye and didn't like what she saw.
253	00:16:52	00:16:54	Weapon was a shard of broken mirror.
254	00:16:54	00:16:56	Hers were the only prints on it.
255	00:16:56	00:17:00	No one was seen leaving the motel room, so we're thinking she killed herself.
256	00:17:04	00:17:06	Brutality like this is unusual.
257	00:17:07	00:17:09	Suicide is resignation.
258	00:17:09	00:17:10	These wounds are rage.
259	00:17:15	00:17:18	Did you and Morgan find any drugs at the scene?
260	00:17:18	00:17:20	Uh, just some kind of crystal trace.
261	00:17:20	00:17:21	Smell this.
262	00:17:23	00:17:25	Ugh! Room service in Hell doesn't smell that bad.
263	00:17:25	00:17:26	What is it?
264	00:17:26	00:17:28	A distinct ether-like odor.
265	00:17:28	00:17:29	Pretty rare these days.
266	00:17:29	00:17:31	PCP.
267	00:17:31	00:17:32	Oh, bad trip.
268	00:17:32	00:17:34	That would explain the self-mutilation.
269	00:17:37	00:17:39	Hallucinatory state.
270	00:17:39	00:17:42	She thinks she's fighting off untold dark forces.
271	00:17:50	00:17:52	Not self-destruction...
272	00:17:52	00:17:55	in her mind, self-defense.
273	00:17:55	00:17:57	Well, Henry's running tox right now.
274	00:17:57	00:18:00	If it is PCP, we'll get confirmation.
275	00:18:00	00:18:02	Detective Vega.
276	00:18:02	00:18:03	I know you.
277	00:18:03	00:18:05	You put me in the joint and never come to visit.
278	00:18:08	00:18:13	I was waiting for a special occasion, like the day they'd flip the switch.
279	00:18:15	00:18:19	You must be confusing me with some other innocent vato.
280	00:18:19	00:18:21	I'm only doing 25 to life.
281	00:18:21	00:18:23	Not if you had anything to do with killing Espectro.
282	00:18:26	00:18:27	Serious?
283	00:18:27	00:18:30	Damn right I'm serious.
284	00:18:30	00:18:31	Someone ghosted him for real?
285	00:18:31	00:18:33	I'm shocked you didn't know.
286	00:18:35	00:18:38	You best believe I wanted to kill him.
287	00:18:40	00:18:44	But the punk vanished underground before I had a chance to stick him there.
288	00:18:45	00:18:49	So whoever took him out, how'd they do it?
289	00:18:51	00:18:55	Must have been a lucky shot, because there was no getting close to Espectro.
290	00:18:57	00:18:59	That wasn't luck.
291	00:19:09	00:19:11	Marta.
292	00:19:11	00:19:12	Marta?
293	00:19:12	00:19:14	Who-Who's Marta?
294	00:19:16	00:19:19	No man did that.
295	00:19:19	00:19:24	For a sinner like Espectro, there's forces in the universe more powerful than man.
296	00:19:45	00:19:49	Marta Arterro, Diego Barra's girlfriend from back in '02.
297	00:19:49	00:19:54	Now, the hood grapevine says that Espectro was the one who set her ablaze.
298	00:19:54	00:19:57	And now somebody kills Espectro in the same fiery manner.
299	00:19:57	00:19:59	Nine years later?
300	00:19:59	00:20:01	That's some serious felony procrastination.
301	00:20:01	00:20:07	Well, it's 11 years quicker than it took Kevin Fetzer to catch his retribution.
302	00:20:07	00:20:08	Okay...
303	00:20:08	00:20:11	Two crimes...
304	00:20:11	00:20:13	Both blasts from the past.
305	00:20:13	00:20:16	Do we think there's a connection?
306	00:20:17	00:20:20	Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.
307	00:20:20	00:20:21	You're right.
308	00:20:21	00:20:23	It's lovely.
309	00:20:23	00:20:25	What the heck is it?
310	00:20:25	00:20:28	The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.
311	00:20:28	00:20:30	From the flame lily.
312	00:20:30	00:20:37	The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.
313	00:20:37	00:20:41	Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
314	00:20:43	00:20:46	There were no flowers in the motel room.
315	00:20:46	00:20:48	And we didn't see anything outside.
316	00:20:48	00:20:51	Possible pollen transfer from the killer.
317	00:20:51	00:20:53	Morgan, I got those results.
318	00:20:55	00:20:57	Thanks for the flowers...
319	00:20:58	00:20:59	...but I got a date with Henry.
320	00:21:05	00:21:06	Doc Robbins' nose knows drugs.
321	00:21:06	00:21:11	Motel vic's tox panel showed a lethal level of PCP in her system.
322	00:21:11	00:21:12	Angel dust?!
323	00:21:12	00:21:14	Thought that stuff went out in the early '90s.
324	00:21:14	00:21:15	Well, you're right.
325	00:21:15	00:21:19	And the sample she ingested appears to be from a vintage batch of the drug.
326	00:21:19	00:21:29	See, there's a trace of a component, PCC, in her blood-- it was a compound used to manufacture PCP until the early '90s when PCC became heavily controlled.
327	00:21:29	00:21:32	Nobody uses that recipe anymore.
328	00:21:32	00:21:35	Why would somebody hold on to an old dose of PCP?
329	00:21:35	00:21:39	With age, it acquires delicious notes of a woodsy vanilla.
330	00:21:40	00:21:46	No, it stays the same toxic, stinking nightmare fuel it started as.
331	00:21:46	00:21:48	Doesn't make any sense. Hm.
332	00:21:48	00:21:52	Holed up in that hotel room, dosed with a blast from the past.
333	00:21:52	00:21:54	Did you just say blast from the past?
334	00:21:54	00:22:01	Our motel room vic, Darlene Crocker, ingested a lethal load of vintage formula PCP.
335	00:22:01	00:22:09	Okay, Henry, check out the LIMS database to see if Darlene Crocker has any prior criminal record or any connection to old crimes.
336	00:22:09	00:22:11	Doesn't have to be recent.
337	00:22:13	00:22:16	Today, the past is present.
338	00:22:18	00:22:20	Whoa.
339	00:22:23	00:22:26	Happened again... again.
340	00:22:26	00:22:28	Morgan and Greg's case.
341	00:22:28	00:22:30	A Darlene Crocker.
342	00:22:30	00:22:38	1989, her 12-and-a-half- year-old daughter Chelsea died a pretty gruesome death on PCP, just like her mother did today.
343	00:22:38	00:22:41	(groans) A little girl with that kind of drug?
344	00:22:41	00:22:46	Junkie older brother, Ken Crocker, confessed to having fed it to her and then got sent away.
345	00:22:46	00:22:49	22 years later, Mom self-destructs on the same drug? Yeah.
346	00:22:49	00:22:53	See, I'm not so sure that she just happened to choose today to take that dose.
347	00:22:53	00:22:55	Somebody forced her to take it-- murder.
348	00:22:55	00:22:57	Just like the burning tires and the arcade ball.
349	00:22:57	00:23:00	Death by deja vu.
350	00:23:04	00:23:09	Tonight, you will be visited by the spirits of three old cases...
351	00:23:09	00:23:13	Uh, sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately.
352	00:23:13	00:23:17	The question is, why these three cases, and why now?
353	00:23:17	00:23:22	And who's this mysterious Jacob Marley summoning their spirits?
354	00:23:22	00:23:25	There's no obvious connections, and there's years between the murders.
355	00:23:25	00:23:34	It's three different areas of Vegas, tire-fire Marta in a Northside hood, PCP Chelsea in a trailer park, and Birthday Mikey in the burbs.
356	00:23:34	00:23:35	Two child vics, one adult.
357	00:23:35	00:23:36	One big difference.
358	00:23:36	00:23:42	Espectro and Fetzer both escaped justice, at least the first time around, but the Crocker case was solved.
359	00:23:42	00:23:43	Brother was convicted.
360	00:23:43	00:23:46	So why's Darlene paying for that now?
361	00:23:46	00:23:49	Maybe someone thinks the wrong person paid for it back then.
362	00:23:49	00:23:51	Yeah.
363	00:23:51	00:23:54	All right, there's got to be more to that story.
364	00:23:54	00:23:57	Chelsea Crocker-- she had little plastic flower barrettes in her hair.
365	00:23:57	00:24:04	The strands of it she ripped out at the scalp as the PCP ripped through her, scratched her arms to threads.
366	00:24:04	00:24:07	She was 12 years old, 70 pounds.
367	00:24:07	00:24:10	Gram of PCP shoved down her throat.
368	00:24:10	00:24:12	Dumped like trash.
369	00:24:12	00:24:14	What ab-- what about the brother?
370	00:24:14	00:24:16	Ken Crocker.
371	00:24:16	00:24:17	19, user.
372	00:24:17	00:24:20	We found him a day later in an alleyway on the nod, right?
373	00:24:20	00:24:22	He confessed.
374	00:24:22	00:24:29	Said his little sister was getting on his nerves, so he fed her the dust, just wanted to see what would happen. Wow. All right.
375	00:24:29	00:24:32	And where-where was Mom Darlene during all of this?
376	00:24:32	00:24:33	She was at home asleep, taking a nap.
377	00:24:33	00:24:35	Gave off a weird vibe, though.
378	00:24:35	00:24:37	It was something we should've taken a closer look at.
379	00:24:37	00:24:38	Why? What do you mean?
380	00:24:38	00:24:41	Well, about two years into his sentence, brother Ken hires a P.I.
381	00:24:41	00:24:46	He said he was so messed up on the night of his sister's death that he forgot he had an alibi.
382	00:24:46	00:24:50	So, the P.I. checks it out, proves it, gets Ken off.
383	00:24:50	00:24:53	But the kid blew his luck two days later on a motorcycle.
384	00:24:53	00:24:58	So, the mom was the only one at home the night that Chelsea died.
385	00:24:58	00:25:01	The cup used to dose her had the fingerprints of both Darlene and Ken on it.
386	00:25:01	00:25:05	So with Ken out of the picture, Darlene was the last suspect standing.
387	00:25:05	00:25:12	But the DA refused to indict, based upon Ken's wrongful conviction, because he said it muddied the waters.
388	00:25:13	00:25:17	Well, I guess the waters are a lot cleaner now that justice is served.
389	00:25:21	00:25:27	Well, you know, whether or not she was guilty back then, Darlene Crocker was murdered.
390	00:25:27	00:25:29	And I need... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
391	00:25:32	00:25:33	The little girl was murdered.
392	00:25:33	00:25:37	Darlene got what was coming to her.
393	00:25:39	00:25:40	Hey...
394	00:25:40	00:25:42	are we done here?
395	00:25:42	00:25:43	Because I got a lot of work to do.
396	00:25:45	00:25:56	Chromatogram of the by-products and impurities in the PCP sample from Darlene Crocker's motel room this morning, and the same analysis of the PCP that killed Chelsea Crocker in '89.
397	00:25:56	00:25:59	Mother and daughter didn't just die on PCP.
398	00:25:59	00:26:01	They died on PCP from the exact same batch.
399	00:26:01	00:26:07	Well, no dealer or user would hold on to the same drug batch for 22 years.
400	00:26:08	00:26:10	But I know someplace that does.
401	00:26:20	00:26:28	All right, a PCP sample from Chelsea's death was checked out of the police evidence vault last November.
402	00:26:28	00:26:30	By who?
403	00:26:30	00:26:33	Detective Stan Richardson?
404	00:26:33	00:26:35	Sample was never returned.
405	00:26:38	00:26:39	Richardson?
406	00:26:39	00:26:41	He retired a year back.
407	00:26:41	00:26:42	Did you work with him much?
408	00:26:42	00:26:43	No, I used to drink with him.
409	00:26:43	00:26:45	A bunch of us did.
410	00:26:45	00:26:47	Bar called the Blue Rail.
411	00:26:47	00:26:50	Richardson would buy rounds and listen to us bitch about the job.
412	00:26:50	00:26:55	If you had a case that was really bothering you, you'd talk to him about it. He had a way of putting things in perspective.
413	00:26:55	00:26:57	Make you feel better.
414	00:26:57	00:26:59	Did you talk to him about the Mikey Moran case?
415	00:26:59	00:27:00	About Kevin Fetzer?
416	00:27:00	00:27:03	It was 20 years ago.
417	00:27:03	00:27:04	You know, I might have.
418	00:27:04	00:27:05	Talk to him recently?
419	00:27:05	00:27:09	Not since I stopped drinking, so...
420	00:27:09	00:27:15	11 years, seven months and 14 days. We've been trying to reach him, and his address and number on file are no good.
421	00:27:15	00:27:19	Like I said, you know, it's been years.
422	00:27:23	00:27:29	I mean, last I heard, there were still a few guys who'd tip 'em back with Richardson.
423	00:27:29	00:27:31	Who?
424	00:27:36	00:27:38	Hey, what do you drink, Jim?
425	00:27:38	00:27:40	Are you a scotch man?
426	00:27:40	00:27:43	I'm more picky about the company than the drink.
427	00:27:43	00:27:44	Did you forget something?
428	00:27:44	00:27:47	I heard that you used to drink with Stan Richardson.
429	00:27:47	00:27:49	Yeah, and...?
430	00:27:49	00:27:52	Well, I was just hoping you could tell me anything you could about him?
431	00:27:52	00:27:54	He's a good detective.
432	00:27:54	00:27:55	Wore the job hard.
433	00:27:55	00:27:57	Hopefully on a houseboat somewhere.
434	00:27:59	00:28:00	Did something happen to him?
435	00:28:00	00:28:03	Do you know where that houseboat might be?
436	00:28:03	00:28:06	This about the revenge murders?
437	00:28:06	00:28:07	Do you think he's involved?
438	00:28:07	00:28:10	We have reason to believe, yeah.
439	00:28:10	00:28:11	You're wrong. It's a fantasy.
440	00:28:11	00:28:15	Every cop keeps a hit list of loose cases and unfinished business running around in his head.
441	00:28:15	00:28:17	Nobody ever acts on it.
442	00:28:17	00:28:21	Stan Richardson checked out drug evidence two days before he retired.
443	00:28:21	00:28:25	It was used this morning in the murder of Darlene Crocker.
444	00:28:30	00:28:34	Richardson is not a murderer.
445	00:28:34	00:28:36	Well, maybe he calls it justice.
446	00:28:36	00:28:37	You know?
447	00:28:37	00:28:40	They get what they have coming, right?
448	00:28:45	00:28:46	Excuse me. Yeah?
449	00:28:46	00:28:48	Okay, listen up, boss.
450	00:28:48	00:28:53	The Pension Office said Richardson's funds are direct deposit to some bank.
451	00:28:53	00:28:56	He said that automatic payments for rent are to 600 Oak Street.
452	00:28:56	00:28:58	Catherine and I are headed there right now.
453	00:28:58	00:28:59	Okay.
454	00:28:59	00:29:01	Make sure you bring backup.
455	00:29:10	00:29:12	Mr. Richardson doesn't get many visitors.
456	00:29:12	00:29:15	Exactly how long has Mr. Richardson been residing here?
457	00:29:15	00:29:16	Six weeks.
458	00:29:16	00:29:17	He'll be missed when he departs.
459	00:29:19	00:29:21	Mr. Richardson, some friends are here to see you.
460	00:29:28	00:29:29	Detective...
461	00:29:29	00:29:31	Richardson?
462	00:29:31	00:29:33	You finally caught up to me.
463	00:29:43	00:29:44	What more do you want?
464	00:29:44	00:29:46	You've got my confession.
465	00:29:46	00:29:49	I made those people pay for their crimes.
466	00:29:49	00:29:51	I'm ready to settle up.
467	00:29:51	00:29:54	Well, we've talked to your hospice nurses, Stan.
468	00:29:54	00:29:56	End-stage pancreatic cancer.
469	00:29:56	00:29:58	You haven't been out of bed in a month.
470	00:29:58	00:30:04	When something must be done, the universe has a way of granting power.
471	00:30:04	00:30:10	Oh, we're in agreement that you had help; it was just more of the human variety.
472	00:30:10	00:30:17	(muffled cough) Well, since you're so at peace with the universe, you wouldn't mind us taking a look around your little corner of it?
473	00:30:17	00:30:20	No. Go ahead.
474	00:30:20	00:30:22	Thank you.
475	00:30:22	00:30:25	If you see anything you like...
476	00:30:25	00:30:28	I have no need for it anymore.
477	00:30:59	00:31:01	Nick.
478	00:31:05	00:31:09	There was trace of lily pollen on Darlene Crocker.
479	00:31:12	00:31:14	Soil's been disturbed.
480	00:31:30	00:31:32	Avenging angel's buried treasure?
481	00:31:32	00:31:36	Mm-hmm. Angel's got to have somebody out there doing the killing for him.
482	00:31:36	00:31:41	That same killer tracked pollen into the motel scene, and the pollen...
483	00:31:44	00:31:45	...led us to this lockbox.
484	00:31:50	00:31:52	Sara?
485	00:31:53	00:31:57	It's the evidence tag from the PCP that killed Chelsea and Darlene.
486	00:32:21	00:32:22	Hidden compartment.
487	00:32:22	00:32:23	Yeah.
488	00:32:41	00:32:43	What do you think?
489	00:32:43	00:32:45	Evidence from another cold case?
490	00:32:45	00:32:49	Maybe Richardson's got more names on his list.
491	00:32:50	00:32:52	Revenge.
492	00:32:52	00:32:54	Cool and serve.
493	00:32:57	00:32:59	I hope you got something.
494	00:32:59	00:33:06	Nick and Sara couldn't find any prints on Richardson's strongbox or its contents, so whoever's doing this is being very careful.
495	00:33:06	00:33:09	Did you find any potential victims? (sighs)
496	00:33:09	00:33:11	Talked with a dozen officers who worked with Richardson.
497	00:33:11	00:33:15	They got any ideas who else was in his bucket list, they're not saying.
498	00:33:15	00:33:17	And skimming the cases he worked, nothing stands out.
499	00:33:17	00:33:22	There's plenty of unsolveds, but no obvious ones that got away.
500	00:33:22	00:33:23	Sheriff Liston.
501	00:33:23	00:33:25	Stan Richardson was my first partner.
502	00:33:25	00:33:28	Taught me everything when I was a rookie.
503	00:33:28	00:33:29	Taught a lot of cops.
504	00:33:29	00:33:35	I don't know who he's working with now, but I got a bad feeling that's his next target.
505	00:33:38	00:33:42	Rex Camford? 15 years back, Camford's wife filed for divorce.
506	00:33:42	00:33:43	Vanished the next night.
507	00:33:43	00:33:47	Same night Camford takes his boat out for a midnight cruise on Lake Mead.
508	00:33:47	00:33:54	All we had was a handful of circumstantial and a DA who shied from no-body cases. No charges.
509	00:33:54	00:33:56	No doubt in my mind Camford killed his wife.
510	00:33:56	00:33:58	What about Richardson, did he feel the same way?
511	00:33:58	00:34:03	Well, after I talked his ear off about it for six whiskies straight at the Blue Rail, he was madder than I was.
512	00:34:03	00:34:06	Which is why I've been trying to get ahold of Camford.
513	00:34:06	00:34:08	His housekeeper said he didn't make it home from work.
514	00:34:08	00:34:09	Okay, why don't you...
515	00:34:09	00:34:11	Sheriff.
516	00:34:11	00:34:14	Ah, Catherine, Sheriff's got a hunch about another possible target.
517	00:34:14	00:34:15	What do you have?
518	00:34:15	00:34:19	Richardson's phone records from the hospice.
519	00:34:19	00:34:22	The only recent calls were made from a disposable cell.
520	00:34:22	00:34:24	Check out the times of the calls.
521	00:34:24	00:34:26	They line up with the times of the murders.
522	00:34:26	00:34:28	Yeah.
523	00:34:28	00:34:31	Someone has been keeping Richardson updated on his progress.
524	00:34:33	00:34:35	I was able to ping the disposable cell.
525	00:34:35	00:34:40	Signal hit tower 114 from a southerly direction, about five minutes ago.
526	00:34:40	00:34:41	So...
527	00:34:41	00:34:44	Richardson's wingman is at Lake Mead.
528	00:34:44	00:34:46	Good work.
529	00:34:46	00:34:49	And what are the chances Rex Camford's along for the ride?
530	00:34:59	00:35:01	Detective Vega! Show me your hands!
531	00:35:01	00:35:02	Son of a bitch!
532	00:35:04	00:35:05	Sam!
533	00:35:05	00:35:08	We all know what Camford did, and we're gonna make sure he pays for it.
534	00:35:08	00:35:10	Let us handle it. System had its chance, Jim!
535	00:35:10	00:35:13	It didn't do jack!
536	00:35:13	00:35:15	You know, if it was just you and me, you'd be down here helping me out.
537	00:35:15	00:35:17	I'm trying to help you.
538	00:35:17	00:35:19	Lose the piece, and we're all good.
539	00:35:20	00:35:22	Drop the gun, Sam.
540	00:35:22	00:35:23	Hey, guys, he's not moving.
541	00:35:25	00:35:28	Come on, Sammy, we've been through too much together, man.
542	00:35:28	00:35:29	Let us help you out.
543	00:35:35	00:35:37	Sure.
544	00:35:38	00:35:40	You can help me out.
545	00:35:41	00:35:42	No!
546	00:35:44	00:35:46	Vega! Vega!
547	00:35:47	00:35:48	I got him!
548	00:35:50	00:35:52	Get him up to the bank!
549	00:35:52	00:35:52	Pull him up here!
550	00:35:54	00:35:56	Come on, Vega, stay with me.
551	00:35:56	00:35:57	Stay with me, brother.
552	00:35:57	00:35:58	Get him on his side. Come on, now.
553	00:35:58	00:36:00	Vega!
554	00:36:01	00:36:03	Yeah, we got a pulse.
555	00:36:03	00:36:04	Go get an ambu-bag. Go on.
556	00:36:04	00:36:06	He's gonna make it.
557	00:36:06	00:36:07	No... He's gone.
558	00:36:07	00:36:08	Control, this is Brass.
559	00:36:08	00:36:10	We have an officer down, 419.
560	00:36:10	00:36:11	Hey, hurry up!
561	00:36:15	00:36:18	All right, here we go, buddy.
562	00:36:18	00:36:20	Russell.
563	00:36:21	00:36:22	Why don't you back off of him?
564	00:36:22	00:36:24	Let-let them handle it.
565	00:36:24	00:36:25	They got it.
566	00:36:29	00:36:31	One additional.
567	00:36:31	00:36:33	Middle-aged man.
568	00:36:33	00:36:35	Requires medical.
569	00:36:56	00:36:59	Okay, bud, Denali's all packed up.
570	00:36:59	00:37:01	It's been a long night.
571	00:37:01	00:37:02	You want to hit the road?
572	00:37:02	00:37:04	Yeah, we probably should.
573	00:37:04	00:37:06	But let me ask you something.
574	00:37:06	00:37:12	There are miles of secluded shoreline on this lake, so why did Vega bring Rex here?
575	00:37:12	00:37:14	Why this spot in particular?
576	00:37:14	00:37:19	Maybe with a gun to his head, Rex was compelled to lead Vega to the very spot where he dumped his wife.
577	00:37:21	00:37:24	Now, that's interesting.
578	00:37:24	00:37:27	What do you say we wake somebody up.
579	00:37:36	00:37:41	That looks like a skull. Oh, yeah.
580	00:37:46	00:37:47	Thank you, fellas.
581	00:37:47	00:37:49	Look at that.
582	00:37:49	00:37:51	Sharp orbital margins.
583	00:37:51	00:37:53	Female.
584	00:37:53	00:37:55	Shot in the back of the head-- look at that.
585	00:37:55	00:37:57	Probably dead before she hit the water.
586	00:37:57	00:38:01	You want to know what I remember most about that Camford case I worked back then?
587	00:38:03	00:38:08	This gorgeous Colt revolver sitting on that arrogant bastard's desk.
588	00:38:08	00:38:10	We still have it; it's in evidence.
589	00:38:10	00:38:13	Richardson's not the only one that holds on to stuff.
590	00:38:31	00:38:37	To my colleagues, who have shared the burden of the badge.
591	00:38:40	00:38:45	Many of you won't agree with my methods, but all of you will understand...
592	00:38:49	00:38:52	...what it's like to have all the pieces set before you...
593	00:38:59	00:39:02	...the picture painted broad and clear...
594	00:39:08	00:39:11	...and watch the killer walk away...
595	00:39:13	00:39:16	...to live the life they tore from others.
596	00:39:19	00:39:21	Well, I could not let that continue.
597	00:39:24	00:39:25	I made a list.
598	00:39:26	00:39:29	Five names.
599	00:39:29	00:39:32	Those most deserving of vengeance.
600	00:39:34	00:39:41	And now, as I embark into life's last mystery, I do so in peace.
601	00:39:43	00:39:48	Detective Stanley Richardson, Las Vegas Police Department.
602	00:39:50	00:39:52	I heard about the letter.
603	00:39:52	00:39:56	Guy certainly knew how to get his message across.
604	00:39:56	00:40:03	Well, cops can be refreshingly frank sometimes, right?
605	00:40:05	00:40:07	Listen...
606	00:40:07	00:40:14	I know you and I aren't gonna buy a summer house together anytime soon, but I have a lot of respect for you.
607	00:40:14	00:40:18	Let's not forget, we did put away a wife-killer.
608	00:40:20	00:40:24	Okay. Good talk.
609	00:40:24	00:40:25	Hold on a minute.
610	00:40:27	00:40:30	Richardson's letter mentioned five names.
611	00:40:30	00:40:33	Yeah, Vega was the fifth.
612	00:40:33	00:40:38	There was a knife inside of Richardson's lockbox.
613	00:40:38	00:40:45	Sara found a little blood inside of it, and it was a match to a murdered informant that Vega had been working a few years past.
614	00:40:45	00:40:49	(sighs) Sam Vega could always be a little, um...
615	00:40:49	00:40:54	overzealous, especially if he thought someone was holding out on him.
616	00:40:54	00:40:55	You want my theory?
617	00:40:55	00:41:02	Richardson knew that Vega was dirty, kept the murder weapon, because he wanted Vega to pay for his sins just like the rest of them.
618	00:41:07	00:41:11	You know, it turns out both funerals are on the same day.
619	00:41:11	00:41:13	Vega and Richardson.
620	00:41:13	00:41:15	Well...
621	00:41:15	00:41:25	I thought I'd get up early, get on a motorcycle, and get very far out of town.
622	00:41:27	00:41:29	I think that's a very good idea.
