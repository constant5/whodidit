0	00:00:03	00:00:04	Not so smart now!
1	00:00:04	00:00:06	(woman screams) Get up...!
2	00:00:09	00:00:10	Shut up! Agnes...
3	00:00:11	00:00:12	Agnes!
4	00:00:15	00:00:17	What do we got?
5	00:00:17	00:00:19	Guy driving by called it in.
6	00:00:19	00:00:21	Checked it out, found a body at the bottom-- DOA.
7	00:00:21	00:00:22	Middle of nowhere.
8	00:00:22	00:00:24	Any idea how he got here?
9	00:00:24	00:00:27	No vehicle in the vicinity. I've just been keeping the buzzards off him till you guys got here.
10	00:00:28	00:00:30	Don't you think you should tape off the crime scene?
11	00:00:30	00:00:31	I'm on it.
12	00:00:31	00:00:32	Thank you, Officer.
13	00:00:32	00:00:34	We'll take it from here.
14	00:00:34	00:00:35	Hey, guys, I'm sorry I'm late.
15	00:00:35	00:00:37	That's all right.
16	00:00:44	00:00:48	Why can't people die closer to the road?
17	00:00:54	00:00:56	He's still smoking, so he hasn't been here long.
18	00:00:56	00:01:00	The ground is soft, loose gravel.
19	00:01:00	00:01:02	No footprints out here but our own.
20	00:01:02	00:01:03	Body dump?
21	00:01:03	00:01:05	Possibly.
22	00:01:05	00:01:09	Looks like he might have rolled down the hill from up on the road.
23	00:01:09	00:01:11	Greg, a little help?Yeah.
24	00:01:14	00:01:15	One, two, three.
25	00:01:20	00:01:23	Tongue's blackened, swollen... teeth clenched.
26	00:01:23	00:01:25	Nearly bit his own tongue off.
27	00:01:25	00:01:28	Looks like somebody took a flame thrower to his head.
28	00:01:28	00:01:29	But his hands aren't burned.
29	00:01:29	00:01:31	His clothes aren't burned either.
30	00:01:31	00:01:33	Except for a bit of singeing on the collar.
31	00:01:34	00:01:35	Any guess on time of death?
32	00:01:35	00:01:36	Give me a second.
33	00:01:48	00:01:50	Whoa! Oh! He's alive!
34	00:01:52	00:01:54	Roll medical! Stat!
35	00:01:54	00:01:57	You guys stay here and process the scene.
36	00:01:57	00:01:58	I'll ride back with the victim.
37	00:01:59	00:02:01	Push one mil adrenaline. Let's go.
38	00:02:04	00:02:06	Well, my work is done here.
39	00:02:06	00:02:08	Call me if his condition worsens.
40	00:02:49	00:02:51	I'll get it to him now. All right.
41	00:02:51	00:02:53	So he didn't find any I.D. on the victim.
42	00:02:54	00:02:55	What do you got down there?
43	00:02:55	00:03:03	Uh, burned brush and crushed vegetation and bloodstains running down the hill from the road to where he came to a stop.
44	00:03:03	00:03:08	The guy's on fire, he rolls, the dust and vegetation put him out.
45	00:03:08	00:03:10	Good thing he didn't start the whole hillside on fire.
46	00:03:10	00:03:11	Yeah.
47	00:03:11	00:03:17	These tire tracks go onto the shoulder, and then back onto the road again without even stopping.
48	00:03:17	00:03:19	Think he was tossed from a moving vehicle?
49	00:03:19	00:03:21	Maybe. But the vehicle was a dualie.
50	00:03:21	00:03:24	You can see here, four wheels on the back axle. You see that?
51	00:03:25	00:03:27	Mm-hmm. Could have been a hate crime, a narco hit...
52	00:03:28	00:03:29	Could have been anything.
53	00:03:29	00:03:30	Hopefully, this poor guy survives.
54	00:03:30	00:03:33	He can tell us himself what happened out here.
55	00:03:49	00:03:51	Pardon me.
56	00:03:51	00:03:52	I want to sample that, please.
57	00:04:00	00:04:09	As you can see, our victim has third-degree burns covering approximately 90% of his head and face.
58	00:04:09	00:04:13	In addition, there are ligature marks at the wrists and the ankles.
59	00:04:13	00:04:14	He was tied up? Correct.
60	00:04:14	00:04:20	And now here, the abrasions across the chest would indicate that he was restrained with some kind of strap.
61	00:04:22	00:04:24	a distinct burn pattern at the right ankle.
62	00:04:24	00:04:26	It's within the ligature mark.
63	00:04:26	00:04:30	And not only that, there's an even more intense circular burn at the crown of his head.
64	00:04:31	00:04:33	Burn trauma radiating outward.
65	00:04:33	00:04:35	So, Doctor, what turned him into a Roman candle?
66	00:04:35	00:04:37	Well, I have a theory.
67	00:04:37	00:04:44	The distinctive burn pattern, the five-point restraint-- all classic signs that this was execution... by electric chair.
68	00:04:44	00:04:49	So, you're saying somebody juiced this poor son of a bitch and just left him on the side of the road?
69	00:04:49	00:04:50	It's a theory.
70	00:04:50	00:04:51	Oh, man, that ain't right.
71	00:04:51	00:04:55	Okay, next up, we have the layout room.
72	00:04:55	00:05:01	Group, I'd like you to meet Dr. Raymond Langston, Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders.
73	00:05:01	00:05:03	These are our CSI field agents.
74	00:05:03	00:05:09	They go out and collect all those little bits of evidence, and then they bring them to me for answers.
75	00:05:09	00:05:13	Ooh! Looks like they're cooking up a searing mystery today.
76	00:05:13	00:05:15	Are these pictures of a murder victim?
77	00:05:15	00:05:16	Attempted.
78	00:05:16	00:05:18	I hear he's hanging by a thread.
79	00:05:18	00:05:19	You mean to say that is still alive?
80	00:05:19	00:05:20	Mmm.
81	00:05:20	00:05:23	You know, Greg here is our lead man on the case.
82	00:05:23	00:05:26	So if you have any questions, you can direct them to him.
83	00:05:26	00:05:27	Are you Mr. Lodges' boss?
84	00:05:28	00:05:28	Hodges.
85	00:05:29	00:05:30	Uh, not exactly.
86	00:05:31	00:05:33	That's so horrible. Is he gonna live?
87	00:05:33	00:05:37	I'm sorry, but this is an ongoing case.
88	00:05:38	00:05:40	I can't really discuss any of the details.
89	00:05:40	00:05:43	Sorry. (chuckles)
90	00:05:43	00:05:45	I understand.
91	00:05:46	00:05:53	What brings you here? I teach fourth-grade science and wanted to see if this is appropriate for a field trip, but I'm afraid it's a little too gory.
92	00:05:54	00:05:55	Oh, honey, this is nothing.
93	00:05:55	00:05:58	I could tell you stories that would just curl your hair.
94	00:05:58	00:06:02	The tour can definitely be cleaned up for more innocent eyes.
95	00:06:02	00:06:07	If it wouldn't be too much trouble, do you mind taking these things down to the lab and running them for trace, please?
96	00:06:07	00:06:09	Oh, don't worry.
97	00:06:09	00:06:10	I'll take over the tour for you.
98	00:06:10	00:06:13	You go right ahead and carry on, Mr. Lodges.
99	00:06:13	00:06:17	Alas, ladies and gentlemen, duty calls.
100	00:06:19	00:06:21	I bid you adieu.
101	00:06:21	00:06:26	And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you'll follow me-- this way to reception.
102	00:06:26	00:06:32	Uh, I can introduce you to Judy, who will then explain to you the intricacies of dispatch.
103	00:06:32	00:06:36	You really shouldn't let her leave without getting her number.
104	00:06:36	00:06:38	She didn't come here to get hit on.
105	00:06:38	00:06:40	Dude, it's a pop fly hit right to you.
106	00:06:40	00:06:42	All you gotta do is put your glove up and catch it.
107	00:06:42	00:06:44	Ah...
108	00:06:44	00:06:47	Ah... Trust me. Go. Go now.
109	00:06:53	00:07:06	Hi. Um, I'm not trying to be pushy or anything, but I was just thinking if you really want to know more about the lab, maybe you could give me your number and we could go out sometime and talk about it.
110	00:07:06	00:07:10	Normally, I wouldn't, but who could be safer than a cop?
111	00:07:10	00:07:14	Plus you seem really nice.
112	00:07:14	00:07:15	Why not?
113	00:07:15	00:07:16	All right.
114	00:07:23	00:07:25	All right, thanks.
115	00:07:25	00:07:26	Okay. I'll call you.
116	00:07:27	00:07:28	Bye. Bye.
117	00:08:26	00:08:28	What did Jell-O Man ever do to you?
118	00:08:29	00:08:31	Eh, some men were just born to suffer.
119	00:08:31	00:08:33	Since there's been no call from the governor...
120	00:08:34	00:08:42	See, in an electrocution, current enters the head through the skullcap and is drawn through the body by the grounding wire, which is attached to the ankle.
121	00:08:43	00:08:48	Amperage flows through the heart long enough to ensure that it arrests.
122	00:08:48	00:08:52	So we have... 18.5 milliamps.
123	00:08:52	00:08:54	That's more than enough juice to stop a man's heart.
124	00:08:54	00:08:58	But not enough to light him up and cause the burns that we saw on the vic's head.
125	00:08:58	00:09:02	So either my theory's wrong or we missed a variable.
126	00:09:02	00:09:04	Try missing a variable.
127	00:09:04	00:09:07	I analyzed the black flecks you pulled from Almost Dead Guy's head.
128	00:09:07	00:09:12	The material came from a polyethylene sponge-- synthetic, like this one.
129	00:09:12	00:09:13	That explains it.
130	00:09:14	00:09:22	A saline-solution-soaked sponge is used to conduct electricity.
131	00:09:23	00:09:25	But... the sponge has to be natural.
132	00:09:25	00:09:27	Otherwise...
133	00:09:27	00:09:29	it impedes the charge.
134	00:09:40	00:09:43	Using a synthetic sponge increases resistance...
135	00:09:45	00:09:50	...converting most of the electrical current to heat, literally cooking the victim in low amperage.
136	00:09:56	00:09:58	There's not enough to stop his heart.
137	00:09:58	00:10:01	But definitely enough to set his head on fire.
138	00:10:01	00:10:02	You ever been to Burning Man?
139	00:10:02	00:10:04	I have now.
140	00:10:04	00:10:06	So our killer is using an electric chair.
141	00:10:06	00:10:08	Which is easy enough to construct.
142	00:10:08	00:10:09	Yeah, you just proved that.
143	00:10:09	00:10:12	It's got to take a ton of juice to fry someone.
144	00:10:12	00:10:16	Maybe we can check with LV Power and Water, see if there were any surges on the grid.
145	00:10:16	00:10:19	Well, unfortunately, it's not about voltage, it's about amperage.
146	00:10:19	00:10:23	If your connection was strong enough, you could plug this thing straight into the wall.
147	00:10:23	00:10:26	So you're saying that chair could be in any house in the city?
148	00:10:26	00:10:27	Or truck.
149	00:10:27	00:10:32	The evidence at the crime scene says that the victim's head was on fire when he was thrown from a moving vehicle.
150	00:10:32	00:10:34	Which means he had just been fried. Right.
151	00:10:34	00:10:36	So, a mobile killing machine?
152	00:10:36	00:10:37	Right.
153	00:10:37	00:10:39	Catherine...
154	00:10:39	00:10:42	Got a match.
155	00:10:42	00:10:47	Tire tracks were made by LT245/75R16 Michelin light truck tire.
156	00:10:47	00:10:52	Too bad it's only the most common light truck tire in the Southwest.
157	00:10:52	00:10:55	Well, truck had two axles.
158	00:10:55	00:10:57	Two tires in the front, four in the back.
159	00:10:57	00:11:00	Could be we're looking for a pickup or a cube van.
160	00:11:00	00:11:02	All right.Also...
161	00:11:02	00:11:06	got an I.D. on our John Doe.
162	00:11:06	00:11:08	Carlton Doreen.
163	00:11:08	00:11:12	His, uh, wife reported him missing two days ago.
164	00:11:12	00:11:15	We matched his DNA to exemplars from his home.
165	00:11:15	00:11:16	And who is he?
166	00:11:16	00:11:18	Uh, regular guy.
167	00:11:18	00:11:20	Uh, works at a hardware store.
168	00:11:20	00:11:26	Uh, no record, no known enemies, no outstanding debts.
169	00:11:26	00:11:29	You look tired, Greg. You should go home.
170	00:11:29	00:11:31	Yeah, you're right.
171	00:11:31	00:11:33	I'm burnt.
172	00:11:34	00:11:37	Sorry. Unfortunate choice of words.
173	00:11:37	00:11:39	Go home.
174	00:11:46	00:11:48	Did you callher yet?
175	00:11:48	00:11:50	You don't want me to call her, do you?
176	00:11:50	00:11:53	Don't let that number go cold, now.
177	00:11:59	00:12:01	You don't waste much time, do you?
178	00:12:02	00:12:03	Did I call too soon?
179	00:12:03	00:12:06	I hadn't even gotten home yet.
180	00:12:06	00:12:08	But I'm glad you did.
181	00:12:08	00:12:10	I was surprised you were available.
182	00:12:10	00:12:12	I've pretty much given up on the dating scene.
183	00:12:13	00:12:15	It's too painful.
184	00:12:18	00:12:20	I feel wicked.
185	00:12:20	00:12:22	I never drink on a school night.
186	00:12:23	00:12:25	Actually, I hardly ever drink at all.
187	00:12:25	00:12:27	Good thing I took the bus.
188	00:12:27	00:12:28	What, you don't have a car?
189	00:12:28	00:12:30	Mm-mm.
190	00:12:30	00:12:32	Schoolteacher's salary.
191	00:12:32	00:12:35	I figure if it's good enough for my students, it's good enough for me.
192	00:12:35	00:12:37	Your students must love you.
193	00:12:37	00:12:39	Well, I don't know about that.
194	00:12:39	00:12:44	But I bet they'd get a kick out of a visit from a real scientist.
195	00:12:44	00:12:45	(chuckles) I'd be honored.
196	00:12:49	00:12:50	To your students.
197	00:12:55	00:12:56	Another toast.
198	00:12:56	00:12:58	All right.
199	00:12:58	00:13:01	To us.
200	00:13:01	00:13:03	To us.
201	00:13:04	00:13:06	Oops. Oopsy.
202	00:13:37	00:13:39	I think they're going to kick us out soon.
203	00:13:39	00:13:41	We're the last ones here.
204	00:13:41	00:13:42	All right, we should probably go.
205	00:13:53	00:13:54	It's getting cold out.
206	00:13:54	00:13:56	Mm-hmm.
207	00:13:56	00:13:58	I'm not letting you ride the bus.
208	00:13:58	00:14:00	Let's share a cab.
209	00:14:00	00:14:02	Okay.
210	00:14:02	00:14:04	I don't want this night to end.
211	00:14:04	00:14:08	Doesn't have to.
212	00:14:16	00:14:19	She's amazing.
213	00:14:19	00:14:27	Smart... and grounded, and-- get this-- the rarest of all things, she's a beautiful woman who has no idea how beautiful she is.
214	00:14:27	00:14:29	Yeah!
215	00:14:29	00:14:30	I wouldn't steer you wrong, bud.
216	00:14:30	00:14:31	Oh, get this.
217	00:14:31	00:14:33	She smells like fresh peaches.
218	00:14:33	00:14:34	Peaches?
219	00:14:34	00:14:36	Yeah, you know, like peaches.
220	00:14:36	00:14:38	Like, what a peach smells like.
221	00:14:38	00:14:41	Yeah, nice. So you didn't, uh...
222	00:14:41	00:14:42	No, you know what?
223	00:14:42	00:14:44	Don't tell me. I don't want to know.
224	00:14:48	00:14:50	Dualies.
225	00:14:50	00:14:52	Man, I don't like the look of that.
226	00:14:52	00:14:56	Well, you're not going to like the look of this, either.
227	00:15:08	00:15:12	Moderate burns on the crown, but no collateral burns to the head like the last victim.
228	00:15:12	00:15:15	Clenched teeth, swollen tongue.
229	00:15:16	00:15:19	Same ligature marks as Carlton Doreen.
230	00:15:19	00:15:21	You mind if I lift his shirt, Doc?
231	00:15:21	00:15:23	Be my guest.
232	00:15:26	00:15:28	Five-point restraints.
233	00:15:28	00:15:31	Same burn within the ligature mark.
234	00:15:31	00:15:34	Looks like somebody else got the chair.
235	00:15:37	00:15:39	Storage facility over there.
236	00:15:40	00:15:41	Maybe we can pull surveillance.
237	00:15:41	00:15:42	Yeah, all right.
238	00:15:42	00:15:44	Now, wait a minute, now.
239	00:15:44	00:15:45	You sure you want to do that?
240	00:15:45	00:15:47	Hmph!
241	00:15:57	00:15:59	This one is actually dead.
242	00:16:05	00:16:08	So we've got two victims, both fried in some kind of mobile electric chair.
243	00:16:08	00:16:10	Right.
244	00:16:10	00:16:13	But our first guy, Carlton Doreen, didn't die.
245	00:16:13	00:16:15	We I.D.'d our second victim.
246	00:16:16	00:16:19	Elijah Newbloom III.
247	00:16:19	00:16:20	Any connection to Doreen?
248	00:16:20	00:16:21	Not really.
249	00:16:21	00:16:23	Both are about the same age.
250	00:16:23	00:16:25	Both from Vegas money.
251	00:16:25	00:16:27	But Doreen's family lost its fortune.
252	00:16:27	00:16:29	Now he's a working stiff.
253	00:16:29	00:16:33	Newbloom, on the other hand, is a trust-fund kid who's never had to work a day in his life.
254	00:16:33	00:16:34	Sounds like they don't travel in the same circle.
255	00:16:35	00:16:35	I doubt it.
256	00:16:36	00:16:41	But they do intersect at the corner of Doreen Avenue and Newbloom Boulevard.
257	00:16:41	00:16:44	Really?
258	00:16:44	00:16:48	So maybe somebody's picking out victims by street names.
259	00:16:48	00:16:52	Well, if your intent is just to kill, it's not a bad way to randomize your targets.
260	00:16:53	00:16:54	Found something interesting.
261	00:16:54	00:16:59	Both the victims' skin and clothing showed trace amounts for ammonium perchlorate.
262	00:16:59	00:17:03	But exemplars from the soil at both crime scenes were negative for the chemical.
263	00:17:03	00:17:04	Perchlorate?
264	00:17:04	00:17:12	That's the industrial oxidizer that contaminated a large section of ground soil in Henderson after the Phosphodyne explosion in '88.
265	00:17:12	00:17:14	Ground's still contaminated there.
266	00:17:14	00:17:16	Maybe that's where our electrocutioner is set up.
267	00:17:16	00:17:18	I'll have Brass run some unis through the area.
268	00:17:18	00:17:20	Hey.
269	00:17:20	00:17:21	I think I found our truck.
270	00:17:21	00:17:26	00 a.m.
271	00:17:26	00:17:29	The storage facility across from the body dump has surveillance cameras.
272	00:17:29	00:17:33	30 a.m.
273	00:17:33	00:17:36	It was the only vehicle on the road at the time.
274	00:17:40	00:17:43	Truck belongs to one Johannes DeSmoot.
275	00:17:43	00:17:45	Guy owns an appliance repair shop in North Vegas.
276	00:17:48	00:17:50	Excuse me.
277	00:17:54	00:17:56	Hi, Greg.
278	00:17:56	00:17:57	We still on for tonight?
279	00:17:57	00:17:58	Oh, you know...
280	00:17:58	00:18:00	I'm sorry, but I-I don't think so.
281	00:18:00	00:18:06	We're making some headway on the case, and, uh, I think it's going to be a late night.
282	00:18:06	00:18:08	Oh, don't worry, I completely understand.
283	00:18:08	00:18:09	Hey, that's great about the headway.
284	00:18:10	00:18:11	Yeah.
285	00:18:11	00:18:13	Do you think I could get a rain check for tonight?
286	00:18:13	00:18:15	Rain, sun, sleet or hail.
287	00:18:15	00:18:16	Just call me when you can.
288	00:18:16	00:18:18	But don't wait too long, okay?
289	00:18:18	00:18:20	I won't.
290	00:18:21	00:18:24	Problem, Lodges?
291	00:18:24	00:18:27	Don't let us interrupt your personal life.
292	00:18:32	00:18:33	So, uh...
293	00:18:33	00:18:36	you run a background on DeSmoot?
294	00:18:36	00:18:43	Yep. He used to work as an interrogator for the South African secret police, before he fled the country at the end of apartheid.
295	00:18:43	00:18:47	Probably no stranger to throwing a guy in a chair and sending a few volts through him.
296	00:18:49	00:18:50	Where's your truck, Johannes?
297	00:18:50	00:18:54	I told you, I sold it, and I can't find the paperwork.
298	00:18:54	00:18:57	And you can't remember a description of the buyer, either. Try a little harder.
299	00:18:58	00:19:00	Uh, it was raining, man. And dark.
300	00:19:00	00:19:02	The guy was wearing a fedora.
301	00:19:02	00:19:05	His face, it was in the shadows.
302	00:19:05	00:19:07	He was a right tall regular giant.
303	00:19:07	00:19:08	Ooh, spooky.
304	00:19:08	00:19:10	And in a hurry. He paid cash.
305	00:19:10	00:19:17	I had my stooky, hot to trot, out in the back room, so I signed over the deed and he chucked out quick without so much as a thank you.
306	00:19:17	00:19:19	You remember all that, why can't you remember his handle?
307	00:19:20	00:19:22	I'm telling you, I can't, and that's the truth.
308	00:19:22	00:19:24	You know, the truck is still registered in your name.
309	00:19:24	00:19:28	Hey, if the oak never switched over the deed, it wouldn't be my swakkie, now, would it?
310	00:19:28	00:19:29	What?
311	00:19:29	00:19:35	If I was lying, don't you think I'd be doff not to make up a name and a description?
312	00:19:35	00:19:40	If not, you're dumber than you look, and that'd take some doing, now, wouldn't it?
313	00:19:40	00:19:44	You know, it's bad form to insult the guy who holds your future in his hands.
314	00:19:47	00:19:49	Your work permit expired six months ago.
315	00:19:49	00:19:50	That means I can hold you.
316	00:19:50	00:19:56	I'm going to find your truck, Johnny, and when I do, I'm going to put you in a box marked perishable and ship you back to South Africa.
317	00:19:56	00:20:05	Then I'm going to e-mail all the guys you put a cattle prod into, tell them you're coming home, and maybe they'll have a clambake for you.
318	00:20:08	00:20:09	Knock, knock.
319	00:20:10	00:20:12	You have a visitor.
320	00:20:13	00:20:14	Thank you, Lodges.
321	00:20:14	00:20:16	I brought sandwiches.
322	00:20:18	00:20:21	I didn't want you to think I'm the kind of girl that falls into bed on the first date.
323	00:20:22	00:20:23	Oh, I don't.
324	00:20:26	00:20:31	I know this is all happening really fast, but I can't get you out of my mind.
325	00:20:31	00:20:33	Well, I feel the same way.
326	00:20:33	00:20:35	I'm glad.
327	00:20:37	00:20:39	Hey, how's that poor burn victim in the hospital doing?
328	00:20:39	00:20:41	He's actually making progress.
329	00:20:41	00:20:43	We're hoping that he'll help us identify our killer.
330	00:20:43	00:20:45	That's great.
331	00:20:45	00:20:46	I'll pray for him.
332	00:20:48	00:20:50	Uh...
333	00:20:51	00:20:54	Tox panels came back on your victims.
334	00:20:54	00:20:57	Excuse me.
335	00:21:00	00:21:05	Uh, Carlton Doreen and Elijah Newbloom both had chloroform in their system.
336	00:21:05	00:21:06	They were knocked out, probably how they were abducted.
337	00:21:07	00:21:08	She is cute.
338	00:21:08	00:21:09	Thanks.
339	00:21:09	00:21:11	No, I mean, like, really cute. You dawg!
340	00:21:11	00:21:13	Does anything remain private around here?
341	00:21:13	00:21:15	No. Look, if she has a sister, you think you can...?
342	00:21:15	00:21:16	I'll take the report.
343	00:21:16	00:21:18	Oh, sure.
344	00:21:18	00:21:20	All right, thanks.
345	00:21:26	00:21:28	What are you doing at my desk?
346	00:21:29	00:21:31	Leaning.
347	00:21:32	00:21:34	Ooh, suspicious.
348	00:21:34	00:21:36	You want to lock me up?
349	00:21:36	00:21:37	That material is confidential.
350	00:21:38	00:21:41	I'm sorry, Greg. I wasn't looking at it.
351	00:21:42	00:21:44	Ooh, I have to go.
352	00:21:45	00:21:47	I have to get up early, and you have work to do.
353	00:21:54	00:21:58	I'll stay out of your stuff from now on, I promise.
354	00:22:44	00:22:47	You think I don't know what the hell's going on?
355	00:23:12	00:23:14	Sorry.
356	00:23:22	00:23:24	Excuse me.
357	00:23:27	00:23:28	How about a drink?
358	00:23:28	00:23:31	You got a name for the guy holding court over there?
359	00:23:33	00:23:35	Maybe.
360	00:23:35	00:23:37	What's it worth to you?
361	00:23:46	00:23:48	Never seen him before in my life.
362	00:24:01	00:24:11	Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for, it is our extreme pleasure to bring you the greatest burlesque dancer the world has ever seen-- Rita Von Squeeze!
363	00:25:01	00:25:02	Beautiful!
364	00:26:33	00:26:35	Look, I get it. She's gorgeous.
365	00:26:35	00:26:37	But you got to cut your losses on this one, man.
366	00:26:37	00:26:38	Get out of there. She's trouble.
367	00:26:38	00:26:40	She told you she was a teacher, and she's a stripper.
368	00:26:40	00:26:42	She is a teacher.
369	00:26:42	00:26:44	And the term is burlesque dancer.
370	00:26:44	00:26:45	Oh.
371	00:26:45	00:26:46	What's the difference?
372	00:26:46	00:26:47	I called her.
373	00:26:47	00:26:50	Now, why'd you go and do something like that?
374	00:26:50	00:26:51	I wanted an explanation.
375	00:26:51	00:26:54	She told that she was just doing it for the extra money.
376	00:26:54	00:26:59	She couldn't make it on a schoolteacher's salary alone, and she didn't tell me because she didn't want to scare me away.
377	00:26:59	00:27:00	She lied to you, Greg.
378	00:27:00	00:27:03	And if she lied to you once, she'll lie to you again.
379	00:27:03	00:27:05	Now, who is this-this Reddenbacher dude?
380	00:27:05	00:27:07	It's Hammerbacher. Roderick Hammerbacher.
381	00:27:07	00:27:09	Yeah, yeah. Who is he again?
382	00:27:09	00:27:11	He's her manager, and he's bad news.
383	00:27:11	00:27:12	What kind of bad news?
384	00:27:12	00:27:14	Well, I pulled his sheet.
385	00:27:14	00:27:17	He's got a long history of psychiatric incarceration.
386	00:27:17	00:27:18	Great.
387	00:27:18	00:27:20	This just keeps getting better and better.
388	00:27:20	00:27:22	Huh. I'm worried about her, Nick.
389	00:27:22	00:27:25	She might be in danger.
390	00:27:25	00:27:29	Well, you better make sure you know who you're dealing with, man.
391	00:27:29	00:27:30	I'm telling you.
392	00:27:32	00:27:35	All right, I'll catch up to you in a minute.
393	00:27:35	00:27:37	Yeah, yeah.
394	00:27:39	00:27:40	I see dualies.
395	00:27:41	00:27:42	Is it another electrocution?
396	00:27:42	00:27:44	It's official.
397	00:27:44	00:27:45	We have a serial killer.
398	00:27:47	00:27:50	John Adams Elementary School, please.
399	00:27:50	00:27:51	North Las Vegas.
400	00:27:51	00:27:53	Connecting.
401	00:27:53	00:27:54	Thank you.
402	00:27:56	00:27:57	Adams Elementary School.
403	00:27:58	00:28:00	Yes. May I please speak to Ellen Whitebridge?
404	00:28:00	00:28:01	One moment.
405	00:28:01	00:28:05	Calvarium burn has a much narrower diameter.
406	00:28:05	00:28:07	And no collateral burns around the head.
407	00:28:07	00:28:08	It's a cleaner kill.
408	00:28:09	00:28:12	These ligature marks are less distinct, as well.
409	00:28:12	00:28:14	Means he struggled for less time.
410	00:28:14	00:28:16	She's in class right now.
411	00:28:16	00:28:17	If it's urgent, I can get her.
412	00:28:17	00:28:24	Oh, no, no, that won't be necessary, but could you please ask her to call Greg Sanders when she has a moment?
413	00:28:24	00:28:25	Certainly.
414	00:28:25	00:28:29	Uh, she has my number, but, uh, I'll leave it again, just in case.
415	00:28:30	00:28:33	They used some kind of conducting gel, as well.
416	00:28:33	00:28:36	So our killer seems to be improving his technique.
417	00:28:36	00:28:39	Which means our electrocutioner is not just a sadist.
418	00:28:39	00:28:41	He wants to get it right. He's a perfectionist.
419	00:28:41	00:28:44	So, Yup.
420	00:28:44	00:28:46	And no I.D. on this one, either.
421	00:28:46	00:28:48	And again, no attempt to hide the body.
422	00:28:48	00:28:51	They seem to be just left out here deliberately, like little presents. Yeah?
423	00:28:51	00:28:53	I had a cat once that used to do that with sparrows.
424	00:29:01	00:29:02	Sanders.
425	00:29:04	00:29:06	Yeah.
426	00:29:06	00:29:08	I see.
427	00:29:08	00:29:10	All right, thanks for calling.
428	00:29:10	00:29:12	Was that her?
429	00:29:12	00:29:14	No.
430	00:29:14	00:29:16	It was the hospital.
431	00:29:16	00:29:19	Our first victim, Carlton Doreen, just died.
432	00:29:20	00:29:24	Infection in the exposed tissue, fluid builds up in the lungs.
433	00:29:24	00:29:27	It happens to burn victims all the time. There goes our best witness.
434	00:29:27	00:29:28	And our best suspect.
435	00:29:28	00:29:34	DeSmoot was in custody when this poor guy bought it, so, that lets him off the hook.
436	00:30:21	00:30:24	Our third victim's name is Hammish Hershkowitz.
437	00:30:24	00:30:25	Hershkowitz?
438	00:30:25	00:30:27	You know him?
439	00:30:27	00:30:29	He was a professorat WLVU.
440	00:30:29	00:30:31	Listed in the system as a foster parent.
441	00:30:31	00:30:33	So much for your theory about pulling names off a map.
442	00:30:33	00:30:36	There's no streets in Vegas named Hershkowitz.
443	00:30:36	00:30:37	But you can't tell me that our three victims aren't related.
444	00:30:38	00:30:40	The Rat! The what?
445	00:30:40	00:30:42	Herzog--Hershkowitz.
446	00:30:42	00:30:44	The Rat!
447	00:31:23	00:31:29	Our victims are connected, but the story begins long before any of them were born.
448	00:31:29	00:31:40	At the end of World War II, Bugsy Siegel plucked the great French chanteuse, Agnes LaPlouffe, from the ruins of Europe and brought her to Vegas to make her a star.
449	00:31:40	00:31:49	During the war, Agnes had lost her life's true love-- or so she thought-- the great Ballet Russe dancer, Boris Kuchko, in the siege of Leningrad.
450	00:31:49	00:32:00	But Kuchko survived, and made his way barefoot across Siberia, and secretly reunited with Agnes in Vegas in 1946, when they had a daughter out of wedlock.
451	00:32:00	00:32:03	I remember this story. It was Las Vegas legend.
452	00:32:03	00:32:07	My father's idea of a soothing bedtime tale for a little girl.
453	00:32:07	00:32:13	Agnes and Kuchko had to hide their love from Bugsy, who considered Agnes his property.
454	00:32:14	00:32:22	She spent furtive weekends with Kuchko holed up in an anonymous motel in Santa Fe, plotting her escape from Bugsy's clutches.
455	00:32:22	00:32:29	As his suspicions grew, Bugsy had his henchmen follow Agnes and Kuchko to New Mexico.
456	00:32:36	00:32:37	No!
457	00:32:37	00:32:39	Agnes!
458	00:32:42	00:32:44	Agnes! Agnes!
459	00:32:44	00:32:47	Agnes!
460	00:32:47	00:32:49	Agnes...!
461	00:32:55	00:33:03	They dragged her out and they decapitated her, leaving her body in this hideous dance pose to implicate Kuchko.
462	00:33:03	00:33:05	Where we going with all this, Greg?
463	00:33:05	00:33:16	Bugsy framed Kuchko for Agnes's murder, relying on the bogus eyewitness account of a stoolie and small-time operator for the Mob-- Herzog The Rat Hershkowitz.
464	00:33:16	00:33:20	Grandfather of our third victim-- Hammish Hershkowitz?
465	00:33:20	00:33:21	Right.
466	00:33:21	00:33:31	Ambrose Doreen and Elijah Newbloom the First-- the prosecutor and defense attorney-- were both in Bugsy's pocket, paid to throw the case.
467	00:33:31	00:33:32	There's our connection.
468	00:33:32	00:33:37	Doreen and Newbloom are the grandfathers of our first and second victim.
469	00:33:37	00:33:39	Bugsy made them both rich men.
470	00:33:39	00:33:44	And they became pillars of Vegas society, with streets and parks named after them.
471	00:33:44	00:33:48	Now, everybody knew Kuchko was innocent of Agnes' murder, but the fix was in.
472	00:33:48	00:33:54	Tabloids had a field day and a jury in New Mexico demanded Boris Kuchko's life.
473	00:33:54	00:34:00	He went to the chair proclaiming his innocence Ironic, to say the least.
474	00:34:00	00:34:07	Two survivors of the Nazi and Stalinist killing machines come to the land of the free only to die because they ran afoul of a psychotic Jewish mobster.
475	00:34:07	00:34:18	Well, this is one hell of a story, but what are we really saying here-- that there's a psychopath out there with a mobile electric chair who's killing the descendants of the men who killed some French singer and her Russian boyfriend?
476	00:34:18	00:34:19	I buy it.
477	00:34:19	00:34:21	Someone's avenging history. Why not?
478	00:34:21	00:34:26	This is very strange. Well, it's about to get a whole lot stranger.
479	00:34:28	00:34:30	You gotta be kidding me.
480	00:34:30	00:34:31	What?
481	00:34:31	00:34:32	Well, that's Greg's girlfriend.
482	00:34:32	00:34:36	Actually, that is Agnes LaPlouffe.
483	00:34:37	00:34:39	This is Ellen.
484	00:34:39	00:34:41	They could be twins.
485	00:34:41	00:34:43	Born 70 years apart.
486	00:34:43	00:34:46	Ellen is Agnes's granddaughter.
487	00:34:46	00:34:48	Rita Von Squeeze.
488	00:34:48	00:34:50	Aka Ellen Whitebridge?
489	00:34:51	00:34:52	Greg...
490	00:34:52	00:34:54	your girlfriend is not looking so good.I know.
491	00:34:54	00:34:57	But I also know that she's not capable of killing three men.
492	00:34:57	00:34:58	She wouldn't do it.
493	00:34:58	00:34:59	You don't know that.
494	00:34:59	00:35:02	And what about her manager/boyfriend Hammerbacher?
495	00:35:02	00:35:05	I hate to say it, Greg, but it looks like you're in over your head here.
496	00:35:05	00:35:06	That's what I keep trying to tell him.
497	00:35:06	00:35:09	Have you had any conversations with her about this investigation?
498	00:35:09	00:35:11	No. No?
499	00:35:11	00:35:13	I mean... I don't know, maybe.
500	00:35:13	00:35:15	Maybe?
501	00:35:21	00:35:24	Excuse me.
502	00:35:25	00:35:26	Sanders.
503	00:35:26	00:35:28	It's Ellen.
504	00:35:29	00:35:31	I'm in trouble.
505	00:35:35	00:35:37	Greg, I need to see you.
506	00:35:37	00:35:38	I need to explain.
507	00:35:38	00:35:39	Explain what?
508	00:35:39	00:35:40	Please, I'm scared.
509	00:35:40	00:35:42	I think someone's trying to kill me.
510	00:35:42	00:35:43	Who?
511	00:35:43	00:35:45	Give me a name.
512	00:35:45	00:35:49	There's a diner on the northwest corner of Grant and St. Marie.
513	00:35:49	00:35:50	I know the place.
514	00:35:50	00:35:51	Meet me there.
515	00:35:51	00:35:53	You're the only one I trust.
516	00:36:59	00:37:01	Peaches.
517	00:37:23	00:37:25	Sanders.
518	00:37:25	00:37:27	Uh, yes, Mr. Sanders?
519	00:37:27	00:37:29	I believe you left a message for me earlier.
520	00:37:29	00:37:30	Who is this?
521	00:37:30	00:37:32	This is Ellen Whitebridge from Adams Elementary.
522	00:37:32	00:37:34	Is there something I can help you with?
523	00:37:35	00:37:38	I think there's been some kind of mistake.
524	00:37:38	00:37:41	Sorry to bother you.
525	00:37:46	00:37:48	Vartann called from a diner-- attempted hit-and-run.
526	00:37:49	00:37:55	Shots were fired, nobody was hit, but one of the patrons described the target fleeing the scene as a slender white male, 30s, sandy hair.
527	00:37:55	00:37:57	Says he tore off in a black SUV.
528	00:37:57	00:38:00	That sounds a lot like Greg. Yeah, I've been trying to get him on the horn. Have you talked to him?
529	00:38:00	00:38:01	I tried, but he's not picking up.
530	00:38:01	00:38:04	What was he doing in a diner where shots were fired?
531	00:38:04	00:38:05	And why hasn't he checked in with us?
532	00:38:05	00:38:06	This woman's got him really twisted up.
533	00:38:06	00:38:11	Found trace on our third victim-- not just perchlorate, as we found on the first two, but also magnesium oxide.
534	00:38:11	00:38:14	That's used in the manufacture of paint. I just checked.
535	00:38:14	00:38:18	The Dunley Paint Company is within the radius of perchlorate contamination.
536	00:38:18	00:38:20	Factory's been shuttered ever since.
537	00:38:20	00:38:22	Okay, Ray, check it out with Nick.
538	00:38:22	00:38:23	I'll have Brass send backup.
539	00:38:23	00:38:25	(cell phone rings) Right.
540	00:38:29	00:38:43	8 This is King 3-2; we have shots fired!
541	00:38:44	00:38:45	we have shots fired!
542	00:39:18	00:39:19	Hammerbacher, open up!
543	00:39:19	00:39:21	There's no way out!
544	00:39:21	00:39:25	No! She's coming and we're going to blow out of here together!
545	00:39:25	00:39:26	Who's coming out?
546	00:39:26	00:39:27	Who?Ellen!
547	00:39:27	00:39:31	She said that if I did everything she told me, that we were going to disappear together.
548	00:39:31	00:39:32	We were going to find an island somewhere.
549	00:39:32	00:39:35	Hammerbacher, she's not coming; she's gone.
550	00:39:36	00:39:39	You're surrounded, so give yourself up.
551	00:39:41	00:39:43	That's a generator. Deploy.
552	00:39:46	00:39:48	Flash shots!
553	00:39:53	00:39:54	Hold your fire.
554	00:40:01	00:40:03	Hammerbacher, look, you don't have to...
555	00:40:04	00:40:06	I'll see you in the next life!
556	00:40:22	00:40:23	Ellen?
557	00:40:27	00:40:28	Oh, Greg.
558	00:40:28	00:40:30	Thank God you're okay.
559	00:40:30	00:40:32	When I heard the gunshots, I panicked and I ran.
560	00:40:32	00:40:34	I thought you were dead.
561	00:40:36	00:40:38	I had to get out of town; I knew I'd be next.
562	00:40:38	00:40:40	You used me.
563	00:40:40	00:40:43	No, you've got it all wrong.
564	00:40:43	00:40:45	It was all Hammerbacher's idea.
565	00:40:45	00:40:49	We fell for each other hard, but then I realized he was a monster.
566	00:40:49	00:40:50	Yeah, then why didn't you leave him?
567	00:40:50	00:40:52	I did; that's what set him off.
568	00:40:52	00:40:56	He was in love with me, like, crazy in love.
569	00:40:56	00:40:57	Crazy's right.
570	00:40:57	00:40:59	You met the man.
571	00:41:00	00:41:03	He thought he could win me back by avenging my family's honor.
572	00:41:03	00:41:05	You set me up to die tonight.
573	00:41:05	00:41:09	No, I swear, I had no idea he was gonna-- You were playing me from the start.
574	00:41:09	00:41:11	You came to my lab, you looked through my files.
575	00:41:11	00:41:15	You saw that we had a picture of the truck, so you went and you switched trucks.
576	00:41:15	00:41:16	Hammerbacher made me do it.
577	00:41:21	00:41:25	I don't think you know where the truth ends and your own lies begin.
578	00:41:26	00:41:29	We got the truck.
579	00:41:29	00:41:31	And we both know your prints are going to be all over it.
580	00:41:34	00:41:37	My grandparents didn't deserve to die that way.
581	00:41:39	00:41:41	The slate's been wiped clean now.
582	00:41:41	00:41:44	You can understand that, can't you, Greg, baby?
583	00:41:46	00:41:49	Now departing for Los Angeles-- last call.
584	00:41:51	00:41:53	Come with me.
585	00:41:54	00:41:57	I'll make you happier than you ever dreamed.
586	00:41:59	00:42:04	We'll leave this place of death behind and find an island somewhere.
587	00:42:06	00:42:08	I'll do anythingyou say.
588	00:42:08	00:42:10	Anything.
589	00:42:26	00:42:28	Greg, please, no.
590	00:42:28	00:42:30	Take her in.
591	00:42:30	00:42:31	Let's go.
592	00:42:33	00:42:35	For what it's worth...
593	00:42:37	00:42:39	...I've loved you since Tuesday.
594	00:42:48	00:42:50	You did good.
595	00:42:50	00:42:53	Yeah, well, most bosses wouldn't have given me the chance to make it right.
596	00:42:53	00:42:56	Oh, make no mistake, I'm pissed off at you, Greg.
597	00:42:56	00:43:02	You disappeared on us, you walked into an ambush, you almost got yourself killed, and then you left the scene of a crime.
598	00:43:02	00:43:04	Am I on suspension?
599	00:43:05	00:43:08	You should be.
600	00:43:08	00:43:11	But I'm the last one who should be throwing stones.
601	00:43:13	00:43:15	I've been blinded by lust once or twice.
602	00:43:15	00:43:17	Just do me a favor.
603	00:43:17	00:43:22	The next time you get the hots for a mysterious babe, let me check her out for you.
604	00:43:23	00:43:25	I got an eye for the rotten ones.
605	00:43:25	00:43:27	Deal.
606	00:43:30	00:43:33	Catherine...
607	00:43:33	00:43:37	Yeah? Why do the rotten ones smell so good?
