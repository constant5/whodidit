0,00:01:25,00:01:27,That one's not ours.
1,00:01:28,00:01:28,You sure?
2,00:01:29,00:01:32,I authorize all cadavers and associated research.
3,00:01:32,00:01:33,He's not ours.
4,00:01:36,00:01:41,BRASS: People donate their body to science end up submerged in a pond?
5,00:01:41,00:01:42,Crammed in a car?
6,00:01:42,00:01:45,Body farm; creepy.
7,00:01:45,00:01:47,GRISSOM: A body farm is not creepy.
8,00:01:47,00:01:50,It's a controlled study of situational decomposition.
9,00:01:50,00:01:51,"All in all, a very healthy place."
10,00:01:51,00:01:54,Tell that to slim hanging from the tree.
11,00:01:54,00:01:57,Whoever placed our victim here knew that the body farm existed.
12,00:01:57,00:02:00,What they didn't know is each body is tracked by a bunch of scientists.
13,00:02:00,00:02:03,Can't just slip a card into the deck.
14,00:02:03,00:02:05,"Well, he's not in rigor. TSD is under six hours."
15,00:02:05,00:02:07,I'll move him as soon as your finished.
16,00:02:07,00:02:08,Any I.D.?
17,00:02:08,00:02:09,None.
18,00:02:09,00:02:11,"Okay, I'm going to move him."
19,00:02:17,00:02:19,Gunshot wound to the chest.
20,00:02:19,00:02:21,"WILLOWS: Well, look."
21,00:02:21,00:02:23,One of your friends.
22,00:02:33,00:02:35,It's a carpet beetle.
23,00:02:35,00:02:37,It shouldn't be here.
24,00:02:37,00:02:39,Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind of guy to you?
25,00:02:39,00:02:44,Carpet beetles are the last to arrive at a corpse-- when it's almost a skeleton.
26,00:02:44,00:02:46,"I mean, this guy's still fresh."
27,00:02:53,00:02:56,"David, get this body out of here now!"
28,00:02:56,00:02:58,We got cross contamination!
29,00:03:32,00:03:34,"Wow, you got to go to the body farm?"
30,00:03:34,00:03:35,Yeah.
31,00:03:35,00:03:36,I've always wanted to go there.
32,00:03:36,00:03:37,What was it like?
33,00:03:38,00:03:39,Quiet.
34,00:03:39,00:03:41,I hear Grissom goes there all the time.
35,00:03:41,00:03:43,Like even on his nights off.
36,00:03:43,00:03:46,Why does that not surprise me?
37,00:03:46,00:03:48,(sighs)
38,00:03:48,00:03:51,"Man, something stinks in here again."
39,00:03:51,00:03:53,"What, bad milk? Cottage-cheese bad?"
40,00:03:53,00:03:56,Worse. It's all over my sandwich.
41,00:03:56,00:03:57,Smell that.
42,00:04:00,00:04:02,(sniffs)
43,00:04:02,00:04:05,(groans)
44,00:04:05,00:04:06,Yeah.
45,00:04:07,00:04:09,He's got one of his experiments in there.
46,00:04:09,00:04:10,You're kidding me?
47,00:04:10,00:04:11,Bugs or blood?
48,00:04:11,00:04:12,Not bugs.
49,00:04:12,00:04:13,"Oh, that's so not cool."
50,00:04:13,00:04:14,That's a community fridge.
51,00:04:14,00:04:17,Someone has got to talk to Grissom about this.
52,00:04:17,00:04:18,Talk to me about what?
53,00:04:18,00:04:21,You leaving your experiments in our refrigerator.
54,00:04:21,00:04:22,The lab fridge was full.
55,00:04:22,00:04:23,I put in last night.
56,00:04:23,00:04:24,Well...
57,00:04:24,00:04:27,I'm going to test for horizontal motion on bloodstains.
58,00:04:27,00:04:29,Vis-a-vis surface textures.
59,00:04:29,00:04:32,"Hey, any of you guys got any linoleum at home?"
60,00:04:32,00:04:35,"STOKES: That blood is rank, man."
61,00:04:35,00:04:39,I know. That's why the Red Cross gives it to us 'cause it's past its expiration date.
62,00:04:42,00:04:45,Anything new on the body farm victim?
63,00:04:45,00:04:47,I gave the prints to Identification.
64,00:04:47,00:04:48,They're running through the bases now.
65,00:04:48,00:04:49,Okay.
66,00:04:49,00:04:52,(pager beeping)
67,00:04:54,00:04:56,I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.
68,00:04:57,00:04:58,"Way to go, Nick."
69,00:04:58,00:04:59,You really told him.
70,00:05:00,00:05:01,"I told him, he just..."
71,00:05:01,00:05:02,doesn't hear it.
72,00:05:03,00:05:04,BROWN: Yeah.
73,00:05:04,00:05:06,Well...
74,00:05:06,00:05:10,the entry wound tells me the body sustained a projectile.
75,00:05:10,00:05:12,A bullet.
76,00:05:12,00:05:17,"Uh, but there's no bullet fragments in the tissue and no exit wound."
77,00:05:17,00:05:19,"So, how do you explain that?"
78,00:05:19,00:05:21,Bullet wounds usually leave bullet evidence.
79,00:05:27,00:05:29,There's no evidence of a bullet in this wound tract.
80,00:05:30,00:05:31,"So, let's excise it."
81,00:05:31,00:05:33,Do a more localized search.
82,00:05:33,00:05:34,That was my next suggestion.
83,00:05:35,00:05:39,What's your best tool for excising the tissue of our Mr. Doe?
84,00:05:39,00:05:41,"Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore."
85,00:05:41,00:05:45,Database says that our victim is Mike Kimble age 38.
86,00:05:45,00:05:48,He has a townhouse in Summerlin.
87,00:05:48,00:05:50,Brass is going to meet us there along with the rest of the unit.
88,00:05:51,00:05:53,My bet says that it's the primary crime scene.
89,00:05:53,00:05:55,Good.
90,00:05:56,00:05:57,Aren't you coming?
91,00:05:58,00:06:01,We're excising a wound tract.
92,00:06:01,00:06:02,Sounds fascinating.
93,00:06:02,00:06:03,It is.
94,00:06:04,00:06:07,(loud whirring)
95,00:06:07,00:06:10,(siren blaring)
96,00:06:12,00:06:14,Is that Mike Kimble's house?
97,00:06:14,00:06:15,That's it.
98,00:06:19,00:06:21,Seems like somebody beat us here.
99,00:06:21,00:06:23,You think?
100,00:06:23,00:06:27,Neighbor called it in. She smelled the smoke.
101,00:06:27,00:06:29,Thought he was barbecuing in his living room.
102,00:06:29,00:06:31,Where's his neighbor now?
103,00:06:31,00:06:33,Over there talking to Brass.
104,00:06:33,00:06:38,"Um, no, I didn't hear any noise coming from Mike's place last night."
105,00:06:38,00:06:39,"But, um..."
106,00:06:39,00:06:42,"I was wearing my headphones, doing my workout."
107,00:06:42,00:06:44,Did Mr. Kimble have many visitors to his house?
108,00:06:44,00:06:46,"Other than his clients, just, um..."
109,00:06:46,00:06:48,"just his fiancee, Jane."
110,00:06:48,00:06:51,"Uh, but they usually stayed at her place."
111,00:06:51,00:06:54,Do you have the full name and address of the victim's fiancee Jane?
112,00:06:55,00:06:56,"Yes, actually I do."
113,00:06:56,00:06:57,It's in my kitchen.
114,00:06:57,00:07:01,As soon as they let me back in I can get for you.
115,00:07:01,00:07:02,BRASS: Good. Yes.
116,00:07:05,00:07:07,Something...
117,00:07:07,00:07:09,a metal fragment.
118,00:07:09,00:07:12,It's not like any bullet I've ever seen.
119,00:07:12,00:07:14,Titanium...
120,00:07:14,00:07:16,maybe a pin.
121,00:07:16,00:07:18,From the ribs?
122,00:07:18,00:07:21,"Oh, here's the manufacturer's number."
123,00:07:21,00:07:26,I should've bought stock when I first started finding all these medical implants.
124,00:07:32,00:07:33,Bovine.
125,00:07:33,00:07:35,Excuse me?
126,00:07:35,00:07:36,Genus Hypaderma.
127,00:07:36,00:07:39,These are normally found in the intestinal tract of cows.
128,00:07:39,00:07:42,These maggots aren't found in humans.
129,00:07:42,00:07:44,Foreign tissue. Cow.
130,00:07:44,00:07:46,Makes absolutely no sense.
131,00:07:46,00:07:51,"The body farm also studies animals, not just humans."
132,00:07:51,00:07:54,This more of your cross contamination?
133,00:07:54,00:07:57,Only one way to find out.
134,00:08:15,00:08:17,"What up, doc?"
135,00:08:17,00:08:18,"Oh, there you are."
136,00:08:18,00:08:19,Sorry I'm late.
137,00:08:19,00:08:21,D.A. wanted an update on my robbery case.
138,00:08:21,00:08:23,"Oh, it's all good."
139,00:08:23,00:08:25,I'm just starting my walk-through.
140,00:08:28,00:08:30,The desk is crispy.
141,00:08:34,00:08:37,There's a burn pattern for you.
142,00:08:37,00:08:39,Fire burns upward.
143,00:08:39,00:08:42,This is moving downward.
144,00:08:42,00:08:44,Defies the laws of physics.
145,00:08:44,00:08:46,Fire's drawn to fire.
146,00:08:46,00:08:48,Could have started upstairs.
147,00:08:48,00:08:50,Check out the upstairs?
148,00:08:50,00:08:56,The guy who started the fire wanted to make sure the bedroom got it worse.
149,00:08:56,00:08:57,How do you know it's a guy?
150,00:08:58,00:08:59,Why are you jumping the gun?
151,00:08:59,00:09:03,"Well, according to Sara 94% of all arsonists are male."
152,00:09:03,00:09:05,"Yeah, that sounds like Sara."
153,00:09:05,00:09:08,The fire burned longest here.
154,00:09:08,00:09:10,It's the point of origin.
155,00:09:12,00:09:15,I don't smell any accelerant.
156,00:09:15,00:09:16,Could have burned off.
157,00:09:16,00:09:17,Fabric would have fueled it.
158,00:09:17,00:09:19,I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.
159,00:09:19,00:09:21,A fire burning downward?
160,00:09:22,00:09:25,STOKES: Must have found an accelerant.
161,00:09:29,00:09:31,Furniture polish.
162,00:09:37,00:09:38,Warrick...
163,00:09:44,00:09:46,Is that blood?
164,00:09:50,00:09:52,"Oh, man."
165,00:09:52,00:09:55,Something bad happened here.
166,00:09:55,00:09:58,This fire is just a cover up.
167,00:10:04,00:10:06,GIRL (giggling): Are you serious?
168,00:10:06,00:10:09,Hold on a second. Hi.
169,00:10:09,00:10:11,I'm Detective Jim Brass.
170,00:10:11,00:10:12,Is Jane Bradley in?
171,00:10:12,00:10:13,She's in the kitchen.
172,00:10:13,00:10:16,GIRL: Really? No way.
173,00:10:18,00:10:19,JANE: This can't be happening.
174,00:10:19,00:10:20,Mike is dead?
175,00:10:22,00:10:24,I don't know how I'm going to tell my kids.
176,00:10:25,00:10:26,They love Mike.
177,00:10:27,00:10:30,You and Mike were engaged?
178,00:10:30,00:10:34,The wedding was supposed to be in a week at the Tangiers.
179,00:10:34,00:10:36,(door opens)
180,00:10:39,00:10:42,No sweets after 10:00. What's the rule?
181,00:10:42,00:10:44,"Oh, come on, Mom, I'm starving."
182,00:10:44,00:10:46,Have an apple.
183,00:10:47,00:10:49,(groans)
184,00:10:49,00:10:52,He's growing like a weed.
185,00:10:52,00:10:54,What was your fiance's business?
186,00:10:55,00:10:56,He was a photographer.
187,00:10:56,00:10:59,"He did weddings, events."
188,00:10:59,00:11:04,We argued over who'd do our wedding because he didn't trust anyone else's work.
189,00:11:04,00:11:06,(door opens and closes)
190,00:11:07,00:11:08,Hi.
191,00:11:08,00:11:10,How many times have I said you have to knock?
192,00:11:10,00:11:12,You can't just barge in this house.
193,00:11:12,00:11:17,Maybe as many times as I've asked you to have the kids ready and out front on my nights?
194,00:11:17,00:11:19,You must be the ex-husband.
195,00:11:19,00:11:21,What's going on?
196,00:11:21,00:11:22,Are the kids all right?
197,00:11:22,00:11:24,Is Jake in some kind of trouble?
198,00:11:24,00:11:26,No.
199,00:11:26,00:11:27,Mike Kimble was killed last night.
200,00:11:28,00:11:29,Are you serious?
201,00:11:32,00:11:35,Would you mind showing us your hands?
202,00:11:36,00:11:37,My hands? Why?
203,00:11:37,00:11:41,To see if there's any gun powder or evidence of a burn on them.
204,00:11:41,00:11:43,Sure.
205,00:11:45,00:11:47,"Look, uh, I don't want to be rude, but..."
206,00:11:47,00:11:49,I stop paying alimony the day Mike and Jane get married.
207,00:11:49,00:11:51,"I mean, I'm the last person who would have killed him."
208,00:11:52,00:11:55,If we wanted to get in touch with you how would we reach you?
209,00:11:55,00:11:58,You can reach me at any of my four grocery stores.
210,00:11:58,00:11:59,Any time.
211,00:11:59,00:12:00,We'll be in touch.
212,00:12:02,00:12:05,I'm going to get the kids if that's all right.
213,00:12:05,00:12:07,They're in the den.
214,00:12:10,00:12:13,(beeping)
215,00:12:23,00:12:26,(beeping grows more rapid)
216,00:12:30,00:12:31,Accelerant.
217,00:12:31,00:12:33,Hey.
218,00:12:33,00:12:37,"Yeah, Warrick said the fire was orange so low-temperature fuel."
219,00:12:37,00:12:39,Something accessible...
220,00:12:39,00:12:42,"gasoline, kerosene..."
221,00:12:42,00:12:44,I thought you were at the post.
222,00:12:44,00:12:45,I was.
223,00:12:45,00:12:49,"So, anyway, this is where the fire started."
224,00:12:49,00:12:50,Victim's bedroom.
225,00:13:28,00:13:30,STOKES: Grissom...
226,00:13:32,00:13:34,Gris...
227,00:13:34,00:13:37,Sometimes it's about where the fireisn't.
228,00:14:08,00:14:11,Sometimes I hate this job.
229,00:14:15,00:14:20,BRASS: We have evidence that Mike may have had an inappropriate relationship with your daughter.
230,00:14:20,00:14:22,What kind of evidence?
231,00:14:22,00:14:24,Photographic and definitive.
232,00:14:24,00:14:28,That the man I was going to marry somehow sexually...
233,00:14:31,00:14:32,"No, I don't believe that."
234,00:14:32,00:14:35,Things like this happen sometimes right under our noses.
235,00:14:35,00:14:38,We're going to have to talk with your daughter.
236,00:14:39,00:14:43,"Jody, we found pictures in Mike's house of you posing."
237,00:14:43,00:14:47,Tell her Mike would never do anything to hurt you.
238,00:14:49,00:14:52,In some of the pictures...
239,00:14:52,00:14:54,He truly was like a father to both kids.
240,00:14:54,00:14:58,I wish you would just listen once.
241,00:14:59,00:15:04,In some of the pictures you're wearing a bathing suit.
242,00:15:07,00:15:09,Do you remember Mike taking them?
243,00:15:20,00:15:22,Jody...
244,00:15:22,00:15:27,Anything that he did to you was not your fault.
245,00:15:27,00:15:32,You can tell me if Mike took those pictures.
246,00:15:33,00:15:34,Jody?
247,00:15:34,00:15:36,Honey?
248,00:15:36,00:15:41,I loved Mike and he loved me.
249,00:15:52,00:15:53,The daughter clammed up.
250,00:15:54,00:15:56,Seems to be in the protect-the-abuser trap.
251,00:15:56,00:15:59,I'm going to take her over to the hospital for a SART exam.
252,00:15:59,00:16:02,What are the chances Mom knew what her boyfriend was up to?
253,00:16:02,00:16:03,I've seen it happen.
254,00:16:03,00:16:04,"As a mother, I hope not."
255,00:16:04,00:16:06,"Yeah, right."
256,00:16:06,00:16:08,I'm going to look into it.
257,00:16:18,00:16:22,"Well, our photo guys tell me those pictures were taken with Mike Kimble's type of camera."
258,00:16:22,00:16:23,Yeah?
259,00:16:23,00:16:25,Yeah.
260,00:16:25,00:16:26,What are you doing here?
261,00:16:27,00:16:31,A thousand points of light and I only need one to clear up this picture.
262,00:16:36,00:16:39,The blur equals the length of the light.
263,00:16:39,00:16:44,If I can compress this light back into a point then the rest of the picture gets clear.
264,00:16:47,00:16:51,That's how they got Hinkley's image when he was shooting the Prez.
265,00:16:51,00:16:53,What is that?
266,00:16:53,00:16:55,There at the bottom right corner?
267,00:16:55,00:16:56,is that a finger?
268,00:16:56,00:16:58,"Yeah, I think so."
269,00:16:58,00:16:59,"Well, that's unusual, isn't it?"
270,00:17:00,00:17:02,A professional photographer gets a finger in the shot?
271,00:17:02,00:17:05,Maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged.
272,00:17:05,00:17:09,I'm going to work on that for a while and see if I can get some ridge detail.
273,00:17:09,00:17:11,Maybe even a fat print.
274,00:17:11,00:17:13,I'll... I'll see you later.
275,00:17:14,00:17:16,(buzzing)
276,00:17:21,00:17:28,So because you found beef in the wound tracts of the victim you think the meat might be from one of the body farm cows?
277,00:17:28,00:17:35,Did the fly find the beef in the wound and lay its eggs or did it bring the beef with him.
278,00:17:35,00:17:39,SIDLE: I did an experiment similar to this in San Francisco except the cross-contamination was blood.
279,00:17:39,00:17:43,"Wasn't a murder case, but it was instructional."
280,00:17:45,00:17:50,None of these beef particles are as big as the tissue found in Mike Kimble's wound tract.
281,00:17:52,00:17:59,And I found out the ex-husband is the proud owner of a registered handgun.
282,00:17:59,00:18:01,"Hmm, what does that mean?"
283,00:18:01,00:18:03,It means I need to see that gun.
284,00:18:03,00:18:05,"Uh, Grissom..."
285,00:18:05,00:18:07,Aren't you going to tell me anything?
286,00:18:07,00:18:08,About?
287,00:18:09,00:18:12,"The case, the meat, what you found...?"
288,00:18:12,00:18:13,I'm working it.
289,00:18:13,00:18:16,I thought I was working it with you.
290,00:18:16,00:18:17,Yes.
291,00:18:17,00:18:19,"You're right, you are."
292,00:18:19,00:18:22,"So, take some photos of the experiment for the D.A."
293,00:18:22,00:18:24,and then get rid of that stuff.
294,00:18:24,00:18:26,That meat... the raw meat... me?
295,00:18:26,00:18:27,Yeah.
296,00:18:27,00:18:29,How many meals have we shared together?
297,00:18:29,00:18:30,I don't know.
298,00:18:30,00:18:33,Take a guess-- over a year working together.
299,00:18:33,00:18:35,Thirty.
300,00:18:35,00:18:36,I'm a vegetarian.
301,00:18:36,00:18:38,Everyone here knows I'm a vegetarian.
302,00:18:38,00:18:42,I haven't eaten meat since we stayed up that night with that dead pig.
303,00:18:42,00:18:45,It pains me to see ground beef; forget about cleaning it up.
304,00:18:45,00:18:46,Okay.
305,00:18:47,00:18:48,Have Nick do it.
306,00:18:56,00:19:00,You're telling me this bastard took pictures of my daughter?
307,00:19:00,00:19:03,"Yes, we found them at his house."
308,00:19:03,00:19:07,I never liked the way he looked at Jody.
309,00:19:07,00:19:08,I never liked it.
310,00:19:08,00:19:09,How did he look at her?
311,00:19:09,00:19:11,Touchy-feely.
312,00:19:11,00:19:12,It wasn't normal.
313,00:19:14,00:19:17,I told Jane when she started seeing him he's not a good guy.
314,00:19:17,00:19:20,He's not good for our family.
315,00:19:20,00:19:24,But you can't control who your ex-wife dates.
316,00:19:24,00:19:27,"Russ Bradley, Gil Grissom, CSI Lab."
317,00:19:27,00:19:28,Thanks for coming in.
318,00:19:30,00:19:31,Is this your gun?
319,00:19:31,00:19:33,Yes.
320,00:19:33,00:19:35,May I take a look at it?
321,00:19:35,00:19:36,Please.
322,00:19:43,00:19:45,It's been cleaned.
323,00:19:45,00:19:46,Of course.
324,00:19:46,00:19:48,You never store a dirty firearm.
325,00:19:48,00:19:50,May I ask what kind of ammunition you use?
326,00:19:50,00:19:51,A .38 special.
327,00:19:51,00:19:53,It takes .38s.
328,00:19:56,00:19:57,Whatever's on sale.
329,00:20:10,00:20:12,There you are.
330,00:20:12,00:20:15,Got something for you from Trace.
331,00:20:16,00:20:18,Sara?
332,00:20:18,00:20:20,Almost finished.
333,00:20:25,00:20:28,They isolated the accelerant used in the fire.
334,00:20:28,00:20:29,It's alcohol based.
335,00:20:31,00:20:34,"Acetone, methyl methacrylate?"
336,00:20:34,00:20:36,Nail polish remover.
337,00:20:36,00:20:39,Guess that's the six percent no one talks about.
338,00:20:39,00:20:41,Female fire starters.
339,00:20:49,00:20:51,What's this... a burn?
340,00:20:51,00:20:53,Yeah.
341,00:20:53,00:20:55,DOCTOR: How'd that happen?
342,00:20:55,00:20:57,On a curling iron.
343,00:21:09,00:21:11,I'll give you a prescription for antibiotics.
344,00:21:11,00:21:14,"Let's do the last portion of your exam now, okay?"
345,00:21:15,00:21:16,Excuse me.
346,00:21:21,00:21:23,"Okay, lay back."
347,00:21:23,00:21:25,Scoot back a little more.
348,00:21:25,00:21:27,Just a little more.
349,00:21:27,00:21:28,Very good.
350,00:21:28,00:21:30,Take a deep breath.
351,00:21:30,00:21:32,This won't hurt at all.
352,00:22:04,00:22:06,It's melting.
353,00:22:43,00:22:47,I thought Nick asked you not to put experiments in our communal refrigerator.
354,00:22:47,00:22:50,I'm putting it in the freezer.
355,00:22:54,00:22:56,The doctor finished the exam on Jody Bradley.
356,00:22:57,00:23:01,"Physical findings: scarring, chronic sexual abuse."
357,00:23:01,00:23:02,(sighs)
358,00:23:02,00:23:05,"Well, have Brass get a warrant for the mother's house."
359,00:23:05,00:23:08,Check the evidence we recovered from the dead boyfriend's house.
360,00:23:08,00:23:09,They stayed in both places.
361,00:23:09,00:23:12,"Listen, there's a good chance the daughter's our arsonist."
362,00:23:12,00:23:14,She had second-degree burns on our wrist.
363,00:23:14,00:23:15,One thing at a time.
364,00:23:16,00:23:17,Right.
365,00:23:17,00:23:18,You coming with?
366,00:23:18,00:23:19,I can't.
367,00:23:19,00:23:20,Take Nick.
368,00:23:20,00:23:22,Right.
369,00:23:23,00:23:24,Experiment.
370,00:23:26,00:23:27,A warrant?
371,00:23:27,00:23:29,Uh-huh.
372,00:24:16,00:24:18,We've got some samples coming in.
373,00:24:19,00:24:20,They're priority one.
374,00:24:20,00:24:22,What is that... what did you find?
375,00:24:22,00:24:25,Child Services will be remanding Jody to a foster home.
376,00:24:25,00:24:27,Was my fiance involved in any way?
377,00:24:28,00:24:30,He's not your fiance.
378,00:24:30,00:24:31,"Not anymore, anyway."
379,00:24:32,00:24:33,Jim?
380,00:24:33,00:24:39,I just got back from the events office at the Tangiers where you and Mike were supposed to be married.
381,00:24:39,00:24:40,You canceled your wedding five days ago.
382,00:24:40,00:24:44,I even have your credit card receipt for the ten percent cancellation charge.
383,00:24:45,00:24:48,You didn't like the way he looked at your daughter any more than your ex did.
384,00:24:48,00:24:50,No. I just got cold feet.
385,00:24:50,00:24:52,Convenient timing.
386,00:24:52,00:24:58,"Look, when Russ and I got married 20 years ago you couldn't find two happier people and now we can barely stand to be civil."
387,00:24:58,00:25:00,I didn't want to make another mistake.
388,00:25:00,00:25:03,It wasn't that you sensed what was going on?
389,00:25:03,00:25:05,Mike would not do what he's being accused of.
390,00:25:06,00:25:08,Believe me.
391,00:25:08,00:25:10,I'll believe the DNA.
392,00:25:16,00:25:18,"Feels like blackjack, you know?"
393,00:25:18,00:25:23,"You guys all fanned around the table, holding your breath waiting to see which card I'll reveal next."
394,00:25:23,00:25:27,"Greg, this is an abuse case involving a minor."
395,00:25:27,00:25:30,Right. Sorry.
396,00:25:31,00:25:37,"So, I have DNA samples from every male that lives with Jody Bradley full-time or weekends."
397,00:25:37,00:25:40,"First, I have Mike Kimble, the fiance."
398,00:25:40,00:25:42,Dead fiance.
399,00:25:42,00:25:46,"BRASS: ""Match not found."" You got to be kidding me."
400,00:25:46,00:25:47,"Sorry, Captain."
401,00:25:47,00:25:50,The guy has naked pictures of her in his townhouse.
402,00:25:50,00:25:52,The mother called off their wedding.
403,00:25:52,00:25:54,DNA takes a pair.
404,00:25:54,00:25:56,"So, whose is it, the father?"
405,00:25:56,00:26:01,"""Match not found."" SANDERS: Third and last."
406,00:26:03,00:26:04,Give me that.
407,00:26:08,00:26:10,How'd we miss that?
408,00:26:10,00:26:14,"No. No, I never did anything like that to my sister, no."
409,00:26:14,00:26:17,BRASS: How do you explain your semen on her nightgown?
410,00:26:17,00:26:22,I can't... I can't.
411,00:26:25,00:26:27,The county automatically provides your son with an advocate.
412,00:26:27,00:26:30,We can't proceed until he arrives.
413,00:26:35,00:26:37,You getting anywhere with the print?
414,00:26:37,00:26:40,I'm still trying to enhance it.
415,00:26:40,00:26:47,"It's kind of frustrating, that, uh this picture puts us at the very moment of the crime but we can't see what she's seeing."
416,00:26:47,00:26:49,They say the eyes are the window to the soul.
417,00:26:49,00:26:51,"Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the time."
418,00:26:51,00:26:53,"In a way, it's true."
419,00:26:53,00:26:59,The aqueous fluid and the vitreous in the human eye allows for an image to be reflected in it.
420,00:26:59,00:27:08,"Well, maybe... if I enhanced the reflection in her eye with the right combination of algorithms..."
421,00:27:08,00:27:11,I think my Popsicles are ready.
422,00:27:13,00:27:17,"Jake, did you take pictures of your sister and plant them in Mike Kimble's house?"
423,00:27:17,00:27:19,No.
424,00:27:19,00:27:23,"You do have keys to his house, though. Right?"
425,00:27:23,00:27:28,"I mean, your mother told us that both you kids do."
426,00:27:28,00:27:30,"Yes, but I didn't plant anything."
427,00:27:30,00:27:33,He didn't take the pictures. He didn't plant them.
428,00:27:33,00:27:37,He has no idea how his DNA got in his sister's nightgown.
429,00:27:37,00:27:40,"Well, maybe a little hobbit put it there."
430,00:27:42,00:27:43,"That's it, we're done."
431,00:27:43,00:27:44,"All right, hold on."
432,00:27:46,00:27:47,You mind if I talk to Jake alone?
433,00:27:47,00:27:48,To what end?
434,00:27:51,00:27:52,I have a hunch.
435,00:27:55,00:27:57,"Everyone does it, Jake."
436,00:27:57,00:28:00,You just... feel like you're the only one.
437,00:28:00,00:28:05,"Then when you don't do it it happens in your sleep anyway, right?"
438,00:28:07,00:28:14,"Yeah. And then you go to take a leak dust off the equipment and just grab the first thing that's handy, huh?"
439,00:28:18,00:28:21,It was just... on the hamper.
440,00:28:21,00:28:23,Your sister's nightgown?
441,00:28:23,00:28:25,(laughing softly)
442,00:28:26,00:28:29,"The next thing I know, I'm getting, like..."
443,00:28:29,00:28:35,questioned by the police and my parents are looking at me like I'm some sort of... pervert.
444,00:28:36,00:28:39,"Yeah, that's rough. Rough."
445,00:28:39,00:28:42,"Well, listen, in the future, dude..."
446,00:28:42,00:28:47,even if the situation's embarrassing the truth's probably the best policy there.
447,00:28:48,00:28:50,Yeah.
448,00:28:50,00:28:53,"Hey, listen, you ever notice your mom's boyfriend acting weird around your sister?"
449,00:28:54,00:28:55,"Like a little, uh..."
450,00:28:55,00:28:59,"too friendly, too forward?"
451,00:29:01,00:29:02,"Mmm, no."
452,00:29:02,00:29:07,"No, I mean, my sister is the one that's kind of weird."
453,00:29:07,00:29:08,Really? Yeah.
454,00:29:08,00:29:09,How?
455,00:29:09,00:29:12,"She's just always just, you know, ""Mike's coming over."
456,00:29:12,00:29:16,"I can't wait till Mike gets here."" Mm. Mm-hmm."
457,00:29:16,00:29:18,You like the guy?
458,00:29:18,00:29:34,"When, uh, my parents were getting divorced my mom, she cried, like, every day and, uh, Mike showed up and she stopped crying so, yeah. I guess."
459,00:29:51,00:29:52,What are you doing here?
460,00:29:52,00:29:54,Isn't this your day off?
461,00:29:54,00:29:57,On the day you plan to expend a meat bullet?
462,00:30:00,00:30:02,Frozen?
463,00:30:02,00:30:06,"Yeah, I had to freeze it with a touch of liquid nitrogen."
464,00:30:06,00:30:08,"Well, I'm ready to watch history."
465,00:30:25,00:30:28,Bullet-like entry wound.
466,00:30:34,00:30:37,The soft tissue. Hm.
467,00:30:38,00:30:40,"You're quite a marksman, Russ."
468,00:30:40,00:30:45,And inventive-- you managed to build a bullet made of meat.
469,00:30:45,00:30:51,The meat from the projectile was visually indistinguishable from the victim's stomach tissue.
470,00:30:52,00:30:57,We know that your gun was clean but it turns out that your re-loader wasn't.
471,00:30:57,00:30:59,Yeah. We got this from your garage on a warrant.
472,00:31:00,00:31:03,We figured a gun enthusiast like yourself would have one of these.
473,00:31:03,00:31:05,Packs gunpowder into used shell casings.
474,00:31:05,00:31:07,"Cheaper than buying new rounds, right?"
475,00:31:07,00:31:15,The material that was on your re-loader is consistent with the material we found in the victim's wound tract.
476,00:31:15,00:31:17,Ground beef.
477,00:31:20,00:31:22,A father knows.
478,00:31:25,00:31:28,"He was giving her gifts, you know, cameras."
479,00:31:33,00:31:36,He gave her a camera?
480,00:31:39,00:31:46,"And the wedding was, like, a week off and he was going to be living under the same roof as my children full-time."
481,00:31:46,00:31:51,"When I went over there you know, I was just going to set him straight, right?"
482,00:31:51,00:31:53,You know what he says?
483,00:31:53,00:31:55,"Now, I can't help it if she likes me."
484,00:31:55,00:31:58,"I guess it's like mother, like daughter."
485,00:31:58,00:32:02,You touch my little girl and I will kill you.
486,00:32:02,00:32:04,Too late.
487,00:32:04,00:32:06,That's when I lost it.
488,00:32:06,00:32:09,Then you dumped him at the body farm.
489,00:32:09,00:32:15,Your grocery chain makes regular meat deliveries there for experimental purposes.
490,00:32:15,00:32:17,Then what?
491,00:32:17,00:32:21,You arsoned his place to cover up the murder?
492,00:32:21,00:32:26,GRISSOM: Grabbed the nail polish remover from the bedside table poured it all over the place?
493,00:32:27,00:32:28,I'll tell you the truth.
494,00:32:28,00:32:29,I...
495,00:32:29,00:32:33,I feel relieved.
496,00:32:33,00:32:36,I'd like to make a formal confession.
497,00:32:36,00:32:40,He can confess to the homicide but we're still examining evidence on the arson.
498,00:32:40,00:32:44,"The guy wants to take the heat for his daughter on the arson well, where's the harm in that?"
499,00:32:44,00:32:48,The harm would be to the justice system unless I misunderstand our place in it.
500,00:32:48,00:32:51,Don't you think that little girl's been through enough?
501,00:32:51,00:32:56,What I think and what the evidence proves are possibly two different things.
502,00:33:00,00:33:02,What is this?
503,00:33:02,00:33:10,"It's, uh, just what it says: it's a request for a leave of absence-- six months... year, maybe."
504,00:33:10,00:33:11,Why?
505,00:33:11,00:33:17,I was thinking of checking out the federal government system-- FBI...
506,00:33:17,00:33:18,(laughs)
507,00:33:18,00:33:21,We have the best lab in the country.
508,00:33:21,00:33:24,I need a different work environment.
509,00:33:24,00:33:26,What doesthatmean?
510,00:33:26,00:33:30,"One with, um, communication..."
511,00:33:30,00:33:32,respect.
512,00:33:32,00:33:34,Everybody here respects you.
513,00:33:34,00:33:35,You don't.
514,00:33:35,00:33:39,Is this about that hamburger thing?
515,00:33:39,00:33:42,No. Grissom...
516,00:33:42,00:33:44,this is not about that hamburger thing.
517,00:33:44,00:33:46,I-I-I don't believe you.
518,00:33:46,00:33:50,How can you reduce everything that I've said to some kind of single quirk?
519,00:33:50,00:33:52,Do you think the problem here is just about me?
520,00:33:55,00:33:58,"If you don't sign my leave, I'm going to have to quit."
521,00:34:03,00:34:05,"Hey, Sara?"
522,00:34:09,00:34:12,The lab needs you here.
523,00:34:14,00:34:16,Great.
524,00:34:26,00:34:29,Did you hear the dad copped a plea on the murder and the D.A. expedited it?
525,00:34:30,00:34:32,"Voluntary man, first offense."
526,00:34:32,00:34:34,Out on bail. Free in four.
527,00:34:34,00:34:38,No jury was going to convict a father for killing his daughter's abuser.
528,00:34:38,00:34:39,What do you have?
529,00:34:40,00:34:43,Accelerant. Identical to the type found at the arson.
530,00:34:44,00:34:47,Police got it out of Jody's gym locker.
531,00:34:48,00:34:49,(sizzling)
532,00:34:59,00:35:01,Looks as if Jody was probably telling the truth.
533,00:35:01,00:35:04,She did burn herself on a curling iron.
534,00:35:04,00:35:06,So who started the fire?
535,00:35:24,00:35:25,NICK: Hey. Hey.
536,00:35:25,00:35:28,You get anywhere with those fingerprints?
537,00:35:28,00:35:29,Back burner.
538,00:35:29,00:35:33,I've been working on this reflection in her eye.
539,00:35:33,00:35:35,You see what I'm seeing?
540,00:35:35,00:35:36,No.
541,00:35:36,00:35:37,Come on.
542,00:35:37,00:35:40,I've been working on this enhancement all night.
543,00:35:40,00:35:41,Look closer.
544,00:35:41,00:35:42,What is it?
545,00:35:43,00:35:46,"A clock, a mirror?"
546,00:35:48,00:35:53,"It's got a latch, a lock."
547,00:35:53,00:35:55,A porthole?
548,00:35:55,00:35:57,It's a porthole?
549,00:35:57,00:35:59,Yeah.
550,00:35:59,00:36:02,These pictures were taken on a boat.
551,00:36:09,00:36:10,Miss Bradley.
552,00:36:10,00:36:11,Yes.
553,00:36:11,00:36:12,Warrick Brown.
554,00:36:12,00:36:16,"Your fiance Mike, did he own a boat?"
555,00:36:16,00:36:18,A boat? No.
556,00:36:18,00:36:19,No?
557,00:36:19,00:36:21,Did he borrow one or rent one?
558,00:36:22,00:36:25,He wanted to borrow my ex-husband's boat but he was too proud to ask.
559,00:36:26,00:36:27,Your ex-husband owned a boat?
560,00:36:27,00:36:30,He bought one after our divorce.
561,00:36:31,00:36:32,I've never been on it.
562,00:36:32,00:36:34,Okay. Thank you.
563,00:37:00,00:37:03,Jody?
564,00:37:03,00:37:05,We know that Mike gave you his camera.
565,00:37:10,00:37:16,We suspect that your father used it to take pictures of you on his boat.
566,00:37:21,00:37:30,We believe that he then placed the camera back at Mike's to implicate him along with the pictures.
567,00:37:31,00:37:37,He said I was like my mom when she was young and they were happy.
568,00:37:37,00:37:43,He said having me was like having his family back.
569,00:37:49,00:37:51,Did you ever tell your mom?
570,00:37:53,00:37:56,I tried.
571,00:37:56,00:37:57,I don't want to go to Dad's.
572,00:37:57,00:38:00,"You know what the judge said: Two weeks with Dad, two with me."
573,00:38:00,00:38:07,"Jody, we have strong forensic evidence against your father."
574,00:38:07,00:38:12,But cases like this are very difficult to prove.
575,00:38:12,00:38:16,A victim testifying makes all the difference.
576,00:38:18,00:38:21,He told me if I ever talked he'd kill me.
577,00:38:21,00:38:24,"Jody, if you don't talk..."
578,00:38:24,00:38:28,I told Mike and he was going to fix things.
579,00:38:34,00:38:38,And my dad killed him...
580,00:38:38,00:38:40,okay?
581,00:38:40,00:38:42,(door opens)
582,00:38:42,00:38:44,BROWN: Catherine.
583,00:38:48,00:38:50,What is this?
584,00:38:50,00:38:53,Found it on the boat.
585,00:38:53,00:38:55,DNA just ran it.
586,00:38:58,00:39:01,"She's under 14, right?"
587,00:39:01,00:39:03,"Yeah, 12."
588,00:39:15,00:39:17,He didn't take pictures of his daughter.
589,00:39:17,00:39:19,He never touched her.
590,00:39:19,00:39:25,"He's a loving, devoted father who works hard at his chain of grocery stores to keep her in good schools."
591,00:39:25,00:39:29,"Except when she's on his boat, right?"
592,00:39:32,00:39:35,This is your sleeping bag we took off your boat.
593,00:39:35,00:39:37,Our lab turned it inside-out.
594,00:39:37,00:39:43,The discoloration you see is a mixture of vaginal and seminal fluid...
595,00:39:43,00:39:45,your daughter's and yours.
596,00:39:46,00:39:47,Okay.
597,00:39:48,00:39:49,"Don't say a word, Russ."
598,00:39:49,00:39:51,He doesn't have to.
599,00:39:51,00:39:54,The sleeping bag's talking loud and clear.
600,00:39:57,00:39:59,"Brad, make me a deal."
601,00:39:59,00:40:00,I can't.
602,00:40:00,00:40:01,What do you mean you can't?
603,00:40:01,00:40:02,You got me four years for murder.
604,00:40:03,00:40:03,I can't.
605,00:40:04,00:40:05,You can get me something.
606,00:40:05,00:40:07,"No, he can't."
607,00:40:07,00:40:10,In the state of Nevada we're all bound by a legal statute.
608,00:40:10,00:40:17,The sexual assault of a minor age 14 and under is a mandatory life sentence with no possibility for parole.
609,00:40:39,00:40:40,Excuse me.
610,00:40:40,00:40:42,Could I talk to you for a moment?
611,00:40:42,00:40:44,"Why don't you wait over there, sweetie."
612,00:40:44,00:40:45,Okay.
613,00:40:45,00:40:49,I owe you an apology.
614,00:40:49,00:40:51,I have an eight-year-old daughter.
615,00:40:51,00:40:52,It's okay.
616,00:40:54,00:40:57,You were looking out for mine.
617,00:41:14,00:41:16,"GRISSOM: Tough case, huh?"
618,00:41:16,00:41:20,Just give me a straight-ahead murder any day.
619,00:41:20,00:41:25,"Well, you wouldn't be human if it didn't affect you."
620,00:41:27,00:41:32,I heard about you and Sara.
621,00:41:32,00:41:37,"Sara, you know, she gets very emotional."
622,00:41:39,00:41:40,Are you in denial?
623,00:41:40,00:41:46,"No, that's... no, no. Way too analytical."
624,00:41:46,00:41:48,"Wow, you got burned bad, huh?"
625,00:41:48,00:41:50,Welcome to the club.
626,00:41:50,00:41:54,I got third-degree burns from my marriage.
627,00:41:54,00:41:55,Happens to everybody.
628,00:41:55,00:41:56,Everybody just moves on.
629,00:41:56,00:41:59,Good.
630,00:41:59,00:42:01,Let's move on.
631,00:42:01,00:42:02,But you have to deal with it.
632,00:42:02,00:42:04,You have to deal with it first.
633,00:42:04,00:42:06,You got to deal with it before it goes away.
634,00:42:06,00:42:08,You are the supervisor.
635,00:42:08,00:42:14,"You have responsibilities, and people are making a family around you whether you like it not, whether you give them permission or not."
636,00:42:17,00:42:20,We don't have to go to the Grand Tetons together.
637,00:42:20,00:42:25,Just... every now and then you got to lift your head up out of that microscope.
638,00:42:27,00:42:29,Yeah.
639,00:42:52,00:42:54,(sighs)
640,00:42:58,00:42:59,(dialing phone)
641,00:43:03,00:43:09,"Yeah, hi. I'd like to get some flowers for a girl."
642,00:43:09,00:43:10,"No, no. Not flowers."
643,00:43:10,00:43:11,A plant. A living plant.
644,00:43:11,00:43:13,She likes vegetation.
645,00:43:13,00:43:16,"Yeah, that'd be fine."
646,00:43:16,00:43:18,To a Sara Sidle.
647,00:43:18,00:43:25,"Deliver it at the CSI Division, Las Vegas Police Department the one out on North Trop Boulevard."
648,00:43:25,00:43:27,"Yeah, you can bill me at the same place."
649,00:43:27,00:43:30,Gil Grissom.
650,00:43:30,00:43:32,The sentiment?
651,00:43:32,00:43:35,"Oh, on the card."
652,00:43:35,00:43:39,"Um, uh..."
653,00:43:39,00:43:42,have it say...
654,00:43:42,00:43:46,"have it say, uh..."
655,00:43:46,00:43:49,"""From Grissom."" Thank you."
