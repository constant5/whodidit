0	00:01:29	00:01:35	A trucker driving by saw the body, called it in.
1	00:01:35	00:01:37	Easy to miss.
2	00:01:37	00:01:41	The coroner's tied up on a multiple in Pahrump, but they're en route.
3	00:01:42	00:01:43	Officer Jensen was first responding.
4	00:01:43	00:01:48	When he saw the condition of the body, he backed out of the scene, stepping in his own footprints.
5	00:01:48	00:01:52	Anyway, we've been beating the bush looking for her personal effects, but so far nothing.
6	00:01:52	00:01:55	Jane Doe it is.
7	00:02:52	00:02:54	You must be Keppler.
8	00:02:54	00:02:55	Willows?
9	00:02:55	00:02:56	Catherine.
10	00:02:56	00:02:59	Sorry I'm late.
11	00:02:59	00:03:01	Got stuck on the Strip.
12	00:03:07	00:03:08	Welcome to Las Vegas.
13	00:03:22	00:03:25	Is that how they're doing things in Baltimore these days?
14	00:03:26	00:03:29	Out here, we don't touch the body until the coroner releases it.
15	00:03:29	00:03:32	Sorry. Just...
16	00:03:32	00:03:34	trying to get a better look at her face.
17	00:03:34	00:03:38	There's bruising around the neck, relatively fresh.
18	00:03:38	00:03:40	No other obvious wounds on the body.
19	00:03:40	00:03:43	This girl's barely out of high school.
20	00:03:43	00:03:44	Catnip.
21	00:03:44	00:03:46	Excuse me?
22	00:03:46	00:03:49	The way they attract men at that age; it's like catnip.
23	00:03:49	00:03:51	That's a terrifying thought.
24	00:03:51	00:03:54	You have kids?
25	00:03:54	00:03:57	A daughter, 15.
26	00:03:57	00:03:59	You must be a hit on career day.
27	00:04:00	00:04:02	I try not to bring my work home with me.
28	00:04:02	00:04:04	Yeah.
29	00:04:04	00:04:05	How about you?
30	00:04:05	00:04:06	What?
31	00:04:06	00:04:07	Any kids?
32	00:04:11	00:04:14	Patchy discolorations on the skin.
33	00:04:14	00:04:15	Looks like dehydration.
34	00:04:19	00:04:21	White fibers.
35	00:04:21	00:04:24	I'm guessing cotton.
36	00:04:24	00:04:29	Looks like she's been swabbed down with something that evaporated, maybe alcohol.
37	00:04:35	00:04:40	Unlike most men, this one knows how to clean up after himself.
38	00:05:38	00:05:41	So how long is this fellow Keppler supposed to be with us?
39	00:05:41	00:05:44	Well, he was hired to staff the new day shift, but...
40	00:05:44	00:05:48	since we're one shy with Grissom away, Ecklie wanted us to break him in for a few weeks.
41	00:05:50	00:05:52	Got a broken fingernail.
42	00:05:52	00:05:56	Please tell me she got a piece of her attacker.
43	00:05:56	00:05:59	If the nail had been torn off, the break would be smooth.
44	00:05:59	00:06:02	It's jagged; she's a biter.
45	00:06:06	00:06:09	So flash this photo around the Alphabets.
46	00:06:09	00:06:13	If she's a pro or a local, somebody will recognize her.
47	00:06:13	00:06:14	Alphabets?
48	00:06:14	00:06:15	Yeah, it's a neighborhood.
49	00:06:15	00:06:17	You know, A Street, B Street, D Street.
50	00:06:17	00:06:18	Mm.
51	00:06:18	00:06:23	A through F is pretty bad-- homeless, junkies, scumbags, the hookers we chase off the Strip.
52	00:06:23	00:06:26	I mean, if you're down and out in Vegas, sooner or later, you're gonna end up here.
53	00:06:26	00:06:29	Hear you got one of the fastest growing murder rates in the country.
54	00:06:29	00:06:31	Yeah, we're very competitive.
55	00:06:31	00:06:33	Is that a Philly accent I hear?
56	00:06:33	00:06:35	Trenton, born and bred.
57	00:06:35	00:06:37	My condolences. I'm from Newark.
58	00:06:37	00:06:38	How you doing?
59	00:06:38	00:06:39	How are you?
60	00:06:39	00:06:41	Thought I heard something familiar.
61	00:06:41	00:06:43	But you got to love Vegas, isn't that right, Catherine?
62	00:06:44	00:06:46	My hometown.
63	00:06:46	00:06:50	I mean, the pizza's terrible, but everything else is paradise.
64	00:06:52	00:06:54	So I see you've got the soil and vegetation exemplars.
65	00:06:54	00:06:55	Thank you.
66	00:06:55	00:06:57	Three distinct locations.
67	00:06:57	00:06:59	Not that it's gonna make much difference.
68	00:06:59	00:07:02	I get the feeling our guy's not the type to track away dirt on his shoes.
69	00:07:02	00:07:04	Probably not.
70	00:07:04	00:07:06	Our best bet's the body.
71	00:07:06	00:07:09	Which we're probably not gonna get much from, either.
72	00:07:09	00:07:11	So is the pizza really that bad?
73	00:07:13	00:07:14	I like it.
74	00:08:08	00:08:10	No obvious traces of semen?
75	00:08:10	00:08:12	No.
76	00:08:12	00:08:16	No visible skin under the fingernails, so she probably didn't fight back.
77	00:08:16	00:08:20	There were no defensive wounds on her forearms, no ligature marks on her wrists or ankles.
78	00:08:20	00:08:22	Maybe he didn't want to mark her up.
79	00:08:27	00:08:30	I mean, look at her.
80	00:08:30	00:08:32	So young.
81	00:08:32	00:08:34	Innocent.
82	00:08:39	00:08:40	He wanted to take his time.
83	00:08:42	00:08:44	He drugged her.
84	00:08:44	00:08:50	We should expand tox to include volatiles and sedative hypnotics.
85	00:08:51	00:08:53	You got something?
86	00:08:53	00:08:56	Highlights and lowlights.
87	00:08:56	00:08:58	That's a hair process that isn't cheap.
88	00:09:01	00:09:06	Nominal hair growth is roughly half-a-millimeter a day.
89	00:09:06	00:09:11	And based on the length of her roots, it's been about two months since she's had it done.
90	00:09:11	00:09:15	Not the kind of girl who goes missing without a report.
91	00:09:33	00:09:36	Your vic's name is Veronica Sorensen, age 17.
92	00:09:37	00:09:38	Last reported in Victorville.
93	00:09:38	00:09:39	About two months ago?
94	00:09:40	00:09:41	Yeah, yeah.
95	00:09:41	00:09:42	She's a... Runaway?
96	00:09:42	00:09:44	Yeah. Parents reported her missing.
97	00:09:44	00:09:47	P.D.'s already made the notifications.
98	00:09:47	00:09:49	So, what's the verdict on this Keppler guy?
99	00:09:50	00:09:51	What?
100	00:09:51	00:09:53	You're usually pretty quick to size people up.
101	00:09:53	00:09:57	Jury's still out, but he knows what he's doing.
102	00:09:57	00:10:05	In other news, local Las Vegas police officers are still trying to identify the body of a nude woman found off Highway 51 early yesterday morning.
103	00:10:05	00:10:14	The police say they received 32 a.m. from a truck driver who happened to be driving down Highway 51 when he spotted the young woman's body just off the road.
104	00:10:14	00:10:16	Sources indicate that she had been stripped of her...
105	00:10:16	00:10:18	I'm Detective Curtis.
106	00:10:18	00:10:22	I'm... so sorry for your loss.
107	00:10:24	00:10:29	That girl on the TV, that is not my Veronica.
108	00:10:29	00:10:32	They wouldn't call us if they weren't sure.
109	00:10:32	00:10:35	We were able to match her fingerprints.
110	00:10:35	00:10:38	Then you've made a mistake.
111	00:10:38	00:10:42	The prints that we gave to the police, they were from a school safe kit.
112	00:10:42	00:10:44	She was ten years old.
113	00:10:44	00:10:45	They could've changed, right?
114	00:10:45	00:10:49	Fingerprints don't change.
115	00:10:49	00:10:54	There was a tattoo on her right ankle-- an iguana.
116	00:10:55	00:10:58	Oh, no.
117	00:11:03	00:11:04	We just want to take her home.
118	00:11:04	00:11:06	Of course.
119	00:11:06	00:11:08	As soon as we've completed the autopsy.
120	00:11:08	00:11:10	No.
121	00:11:10	00:11:11	No, you're not gonna cut her open.
122	00:11:11	00:11:13	Sir, this is a homicide.
123	00:11:13	00:11:16	We're not giving our permission.
124	00:11:16	00:11:19	I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
125	00:11:21	00:11:25	But I promise you, we'll treat her with the utmost respect.
126	00:11:43	00:11:45	And what can I do for you?
127	00:11:45	00:11:46	Let me know when you release the body.
128	00:11:48	00:11:49	It's going to be a while.
129	00:11:49	00:11:50	I haven't even opened her up yet.
130	00:11:50	00:11:51	Well, just let me know.
131	00:11:56	00:11:58	And stop whistling.
132	00:11:58	00:12:03	C.O.D. was asphyxiation due to strangulation, but it wasn't quick.
133	00:12:03	00:12:09	The overlapping patterns of fours and ones suggest multiple events.
134	00:12:09	00:12:15	I imaged subcutaneous bruises under UV from several positions around the throat.
135	00:12:15	00:12:20	Killer choked and released at least three times.
136	00:12:20	00:12:23	That's consistent with sexual asphyxiation.
137	00:12:23	00:12:26	S.A.E. is about what you'd expect.
138	00:12:26	00:12:31	Vaginal trauma, no semen, but traces of spermicide.
139	00:12:31	00:12:32	Guy used a condom.
140	00:12:33	00:12:34	What about tox?
141	00:12:34	00:12:37	Well, blood was positive for MDMA.
142	00:12:37	00:12:38	Ecstasy.
143	00:12:38	00:12:40	That's it? Yep.
144	00:12:40	00:12:43	I can't believe that she was compliant.
145	00:12:43	00:12:44	Thanks, Doc.
146	00:12:44	00:12:46	You got it.
147	00:12:54	00:12:58	You ever see a cat playing with a mouse?
148	00:12:58	00:13:02	Point isn't to kill the mouse, just keep the game going.
149	00:13:02	00:13:04	I'm guessing you've got cats.
150	00:13:05	00:13:08	No. I just like the metaphor.
151	00:13:12	00:13:16	Same game every time.
152	00:13:16	00:13:19	Cat goes home, leaves its kill on the doorstep.
153	00:13:19	00:13:20	Our guy's done this before.
154	00:13:20	00:13:21	I'm with you there.
155	00:13:22	00:13:23	What got our cat's attention this time?
156	00:13:23	00:13:31	Around puberty, most guys fixate on a particular body type that turns them on.
157	00:13:31	00:13:35	Tall, skinny, short, red hair.
158	00:13:35	00:13:36	Whatever floats your boat.
159	00:13:36	00:13:38	It's imprinted.
160	00:13:38	00:13:40	Hard to let go of.
161	00:13:40	00:13:43	Okay.
162	00:13:43	00:13:48	So we know what his type is and we know what he likes to do with them.
163	00:13:57	00:14:01	Okay, we've got three that fit the type.
164	00:14:01	00:14:03	The cases were years apart.
165	00:14:03	00:14:07	1999, 1989...
166	00:14:07	00:14:09	and 1975.
167	00:14:09	00:14:12	Let's bring up their photographs.
168	00:14:16	00:14:18	Look at the similarity in the body positions.
169	00:14:19	00:14:25	They look posed, almost as if they were...
170	00:14:25	00:14:26	waving good-bye.
171	00:14:56	00:15:03	Jane Doe '99 was discovered naked in a stretch of dirt off Paradise behind the old Hotel Continental.
172	00:15:03	00:15:09	Based on the photos, her hair was matted with dirt, which suggests that it was wet when she was dumped.
173	00:15:09	00:15:12	It's likely that her body was washed.
174	00:15:12	00:15:15	That's consistent with the latest victim.
175	00:15:15	00:15:17	Any traces of alcohol or cotton swabs?
176	00:15:17	00:15:21	There's nothing indicated, but there's almost nothing in this file.
177	00:15:21	00:15:25	Based on T.O.D., the body was found less than four hours after death.
178	00:15:25	00:15:29	Yet other than a general canvass, not a single person was interviewed.
179	00:15:29	00:15:32	The homicide detective's summary is less than a page.
180	00:15:32	00:15:34	Sounds like shoddy police work.
181	00:15:34	00:15:36	Sounds like no police work.
182	00:15:36	00:15:40	After the autopsy, C.O.D. confirmed asphyxiation by strangulation.
183	00:15:40	00:15:44	There was absolutely no follow-up whatsoever.
184	00:15:44	00:15:47	Well, there was a follow-up in spades on Jane Doe '89.
185	00:15:47	00:15:51	She was found in a vacant lot off 28th Street near Boulder Highway.
186	00:15:51	00:15:52	Uh, stripped of her clothing.
187	00:15:52	00:15:58	Like the others, several peri-mortem bruises, but check out this hair.
188	00:15:59	00:16:01	Yeah, it's crimped.
189	00:16:01	00:16:03	I remember those days.
190	00:16:03	00:16:05	There's no way that style survives a shower.
191	00:16:05	00:16:07	Killer didn't wash that one down.
192	00:16:07	00:16:10	Methods evolve.
193	00:16:10	00:16:11	Practice makes perfect.
194	00:16:11	00:16:14	Again, the cops didn't come up with a single suspect.
195	00:16:14	00:16:23	There were detailed sketches of the crime scene, microscopy on errant hairs and fibers, even ran the vic's prints through WIN.
196	00:16:23	00:16:25	'89... that database was barely on the Internet.
197	00:16:25	00:16:28	The guy that worked on this case was very thorough.
198	00:16:28	00:16:30	He just didn't close it.
199	00:16:31	00:16:35	Okay, Jane Doe '75.
200	00:16:36	00:16:38	Well...
201	00:16:38	00:16:42	she was found in an alley off of Bridger near Fremont Street.
202	00:16:42	00:16:47	Based on the level of decomp, she'd been lying there about two days before they found her.
203	00:16:47	00:16:50	Only thing about this one is, she had her clothes on.
204	00:16:52	00:16:53	Might have been his first.
205	00:16:53	00:16:55	Or maybe the first one found.
206	00:16:55	00:16:58	Isolated contusions on her neck, arms and shoulders.
207	00:16:59	00:17:01	C.O.D. listed as heroin overdose.
208	00:17:01	00:17:03	Junkies do bruise easily.
209	00:17:03	00:17:08	And the waving good-bye hand position is a natural way to fall.
210	00:17:08	00:17:11	It's possible that this one is a coincidence.
211	00:17:11	00:17:13	It's not.
212	00:17:13	00:17:14	How do you know?
213	00:17:14	00:17:16	Because I do.
214	00:17:16	00:17:17	This guy pays attention to the details.
215	00:17:18	00:17:19	Knows what he likes, he doesn't mix it up.
216	00:17:19	00:17:22	Thing that gets me is the discipline, though.
217	00:17:22	00:17:24	He's got a habit, but he seems to be able to control it.
218	00:17:24	00:17:28	Only needs to kill once every ten years or so, and when he does, he's got a type.
219	00:17:30	00:17:31	Pretty but not pricey.
220	00:17:31	00:17:33	And not likely to be missed.
221	00:17:33	00:17:34	You're a CSI, not a profiler.
222	00:17:34	00:17:36	What's the difference?
223	00:17:36	00:17:37	Evidence.
224	00:17:37	00:17:39	I want leads and IDs.
225	00:17:39	00:17:41	Follow up on what you've got.
226	00:17:44	00:17:48	When I left this place, it was all grey walls and cinder blocks.
227	00:17:51	00:17:52	Very fancy.
228	00:17:52	00:17:54	What made you transfer to Henderson?
229	00:17:54	00:17:56	Cost of living, better commute.
230	00:17:56	00:17:59	I socked away a few bucks, bought a nice place in Green Valley.
231	00:17:59	00:18:01	Ah, I take it you're a shortcuts kind of guy.
232	00:18:01	00:18:03	I guess you could say that.
233	00:18:03	00:18:05	I like to get to the heart of things right away.
234	00:18:05	00:18:07	Any reason that you didn't get to the heart of this?
235	00:18:07	00:18:10	Whoa.
236	00:18:11	00:18:13	October 17, 1999.
237	00:18:13	00:18:15	You remember the date?
238	00:18:15	00:18:16	Yeah.
239	00:18:16	00:18:17	Why is that?
240	00:18:17	00:18:19	Hey, I'm not sure I like your tone.
241	00:18:19	00:18:21	Answer the question, Detective.
242	00:18:22	00:18:25	It's my son's birthday.
243	00:18:25	00:18:27	Day I caught the case, my wife went into labor.
244	00:18:27	00:18:28	It was rough.
245	00:18:28	00:18:30	There were complications.
246	00:18:30	00:18:32	Anyway, I was out for weeks taking care of her.
247	00:18:32	00:18:34	Used up all my vacation time.
248	00:18:34	00:18:37	When I got back, there were a half dozen cases on my desk.
249	00:18:37	00:18:38	My captain told me to let it go.
250	00:18:40	00:18:43	Look.
251	00:18:43	00:18:44	We canvassed the neighborhood.
252	00:18:44	00:18:46	No name.
253	00:18:46	00:18:48	She was homeless, hooking for drug money.
254	00:18:48	00:18:49	You do not know that.
255	00:18:49	00:18:51	You didn't even ask for tox.
256	00:18:51	00:18:52	We didn't need to do a test.
257	00:18:52	00:18:54	We found her at Paradise and Flamingo.
258	00:18:54	00:18:56	What else would she be doing there?
259	00:19:11	00:19:13	Okay, here we are.
260	00:19:13	00:19:17	Autopsy samples for Doe, Jane.
261	00:19:17	00:19:19	99-103.
262	00:19:19	00:19:22	Uh, most recent vic had traces of E in her system.
263	00:19:22	00:19:24	If this one does, too, there might be a connection.
264	00:19:24	00:19:26	To a drug dealer from ten years ago?
265	00:19:26	00:19:28	That's kind of weak.
266	00:19:28	00:19:31	Weak is the best that we have right now.
267	00:19:42	00:19:47	Hodges ran the formalin-fixed tissue sample from Jane Doe '99 through GCMS.
268	00:19:47	00:19:52	There's no traces of Ecstasy, but he did find chloral hydrate.
269	00:19:52	00:19:55	Chloral hydrate is a hypnotic sedative.
270	00:19:55	00:19:59	There were no traces of anything like that found in Veronica Sorensen.
271	00:19:59	00:20:07	Which means if our guy still sedates his victims before sexually asphyxiating them, whatever he's using now isn't leaving a trace.
272	00:20:17	00:20:20	Warrick Brown.
273	00:20:20	00:20:21	Mike Keppler.
274	00:20:21	00:20:22	I know...
275	00:20:22	00:20:26	You trying to do a geographic profile of your serial?
276	00:20:26	00:20:30	Yeah, most of these guys tend to operate out of one place.
277	00:20:30	00:20:38	In theory, as the killer gets more and more comfortable with each act, the locations of the bodies should spiral outward from one central point.
278	00:20:40	00:20:43	I tell you one thing that your dump sites do have in common.
279	00:20:43	00:20:44	What's that?
280	00:20:45	00:20:50	When the bodies were found, the location that they were found in at the time had the highest crime rate in the city.
281	00:20:58	00:20:59	Smart.
282	00:20:59	00:21:02	The crime center sure seems to move around pretty quickly here, huh?
283	00:21:02	00:21:09	Well, in Vegas, new is old in five years, old is history in ten, and nothing ever seems to leave a mark.
284	00:21:10	00:21:13	Sounds refreshing.
285	00:21:16	00:21:18	'89 Jane Doe, this was your case.
286	00:21:18	00:21:21	One of the first homicides I ever worked.
287	00:21:21	00:21:23	Damn, I had good handwriting.
288	00:21:23	00:21:25	Excuse me.
289	00:21:25	00:21:28	Come on, come on, I know you got company.
290	00:21:28	00:21:31	Yeah, that's it.
291	00:21:31	00:21:32	Oh, man.
292	00:21:33	00:21:37	You processed a mountain of evidence but didn't turn up a single suspect.
293	00:21:37	00:21:39	It's not my fault, man.
294	00:21:39	00:21:41	I had the scumbag dead to rights.
295	00:21:41	00:21:42	What are you talking about?
296	00:21:42	00:21:45	There's nothing here to indicate that you...
297	00:21:46	00:21:47	This is it.
298	00:21:47	00:21:49	That's the killer's hair.
299	00:21:49	00:21:51	You did note morphology consistent with the vic.
300	00:21:51	00:21:55	Yeah, but the position- location was all wrong.
301	00:21:55	00:21:58	I pulled that out of her navel, just that one hair.
302	00:21:58	00:22:00	It was a sexual assault, It had to be from the killer.
303	00:22:04	00:22:08	But I couldn't prove it, so... I didn't write it down.
304	00:22:08	00:22:10	This hair had a tag.
305	00:22:10	00:22:12	Did you run DNA?
306	00:22:12	00:22:14	In '89?
307	00:22:14	00:22:16	Man, we were just reading about DNA.
308	00:22:16	00:22:24	The only lab in the country that was doing that stuff was the FBI, and my supervisor-- he wouldn't have called them in on a case like this.
309	00:22:24	00:22:34	I used to bust my ass to keep a crime scene pristine, and then some uniform would wobble over, stuffing his face, drop a hamburger wrapper right at my feet.
310	00:22:34	00:22:36	Who the hell needs that?
311	00:22:39	00:22:41	Man, if I had the tools you guys do today...
312	00:22:43	00:22:46	...I finally would have been a real hero.
313	00:22:47	00:22:49	There's your money shot.
314	00:22:51	00:22:52	Damn it.
315	00:22:52	00:22:54	Did you preserve the hair?
316	00:22:54	00:22:56	Permount on a microscope slide with a cover slip.
317	00:22:57	00:22:59	It should still be in Central Property.
318	00:23:09	00:23:10	Are your sure it's really here?
319	00:23:11	00:23:12	As I said when you called, we have no record.
320	00:23:12	00:23:16	Sir, I spent half the day at Central Property going through their records.
321	00:23:16	00:23:21	Now, according to the case logs, it was transferred to this court in late 1989 and never returned.
322	00:23:22	00:23:25	So, it's got to be here somewhere, okay?
323	00:23:25	00:23:26	Okay.
324	00:23:30	00:23:32	So it is.
325	00:23:32	00:23:34	Excuse me, bro.
326	00:24:39	00:24:40	You rang?
327	00:24:40	00:24:43	Yeah, I think I need a hand here, Hodges.
328	00:24:43	00:24:45	Well, what is this?
329	00:24:45	00:24:47	It's from an '89 Jane Doe.
330	00:24:47	00:24:50	I'm looking for anything probative that will help us out.
331	00:24:50	00:24:52	Those look like rat droppings.
332	00:24:52	00:24:54	That's because they are rat droppings, man.
333	00:24:55	00:24:57	Are you familiar with the hantavirus?
334	00:24:57	00:25:02	Carried by rodents, transmitted to humans when they inhale vapors from contaminated urine, saliva or feces.
335	00:25:02	00:25:03	That crap will kill you.
336	00:25:03	00:25:04	Hodges...
337	00:25:04	00:25:07	glove up.
338	00:25:08	00:25:12	If I start leaking blood from my eyeballs, I'm blaming you.
339	00:25:23	00:25:27	The home team has first and ten in the closing minutes of the fourth quarter.
340	00:25:29	00:25:32	Now the offense shifts to the right side side for this play.
341	00:25:32	00:25:34	And the ball is snapped.
342	00:25:34	00:25:38	The quarterback fakes a throw left, hands off right running back. (crowd cheering)
343	00:25:38	00:25:40	Keppler?
344	00:25:40	00:25:42	He's blocked well and tries to cut through the middle.
345	00:25:42	00:25:43	Didn't they give you an office?
346	00:25:43	00:25:45	I, uh... I like the noise.
347	00:25:45	00:25:47	It helps me to concentrate.
348	00:25:47	00:25:49	I prefer things quiet myself.
349	00:25:49	00:25:52	Of course, I am a pathologist.
350	00:25:52	00:25:54	Just over nine minutes to go in this quarter.
351	00:25:54	00:25:59	I reviewed that Jane Doe autopsy from '75.
352	00:25:59	00:26:01	That was fast.
353	00:26:01	00:26:04	Well, I'm sure the original examination was, too.
354	00:26:04	00:26:07	M.E. was a hack named Sam Barnard.
355	00:26:07	00:26:11	He, uh, retired a little while after I started.
356	00:26:11	00:26:14	Once saw him do a Y with a scalpel in one hand and a hot dog in the other.
357	00:26:14	00:26:17	I take it he wasn't known for his, uh, rigorous analysis?
358	00:26:17	00:26:20	He was known for liking hot dogs.
359	00:26:21	00:26:23	Well, that's just great.
360	00:26:23	00:26:29	You know, if you really want to figure out what killed your Jane Doe, there's pretty much only one thing we can do.
361	00:27:28	00:27:30	That one's it.
362	00:27:55	00:27:59	See the sutured cut across the top of her head and the Y-incision?
363	00:27:59	00:28:01	No. It's because they're not there.
364	00:28:02	00:28:04	So the original M.E. didn't even do an autopsy?
365	00:28:04	00:28:07	What can I say? He was a lazy bastard.
366	00:28:07	00:28:08	That's criminal malfeasance.
367	00:28:08	00:28:11	Well, if you want to tell him, I can dig him up, too.
368	00:28:11	00:28:13	Ah, geez.
369	00:28:13	00:28:14	So what do you got?
370	00:28:14	00:28:16	Check out the hyoid bone.
371	00:28:17	00:28:18	It's fractured.
372	00:28:18	00:28:24	Yeah, it doesn't take much force to do it, so it's possible there were no external marks.
373	00:28:24	00:28:25	But our girl was strangled.
374	00:28:26	00:28:27	So she is one of ours.
375	00:28:28	00:28:29	Gum line filling.
376	00:28:29	00:28:31	Silver amalgam.
377	00:28:31	00:28:33	On the outside of the tooth?
378	00:28:33	00:28:34	That's a cheap way to do it.
379	00:28:34	00:28:36	Old school.
380	00:28:36	00:28:41	Nowadays, most dentists use epoxy and other components to make it match the enamel.
381	00:28:42	00:28:45	I worked a mass fatality fire in Philly.
382	00:28:45	00:28:47	Learned a lot about teeth.
383	00:28:47	00:28:51	Well, Veronica Sorensen had a similar filling in her mouth.
384	00:28:51	00:28:56	Jane Doe '99 had traces of chloral hydrate in her system.
385	00:28:56	00:29:00	I read that dentists used to use it to sedate pediatric patients.
386	00:29:00	00:29:03	Looks like our guy might be a dentist.
387	00:30:45	00:30:49	Her name is Veronica Sorensen, and we believe that she might have been a patient here.
388	00:30:49	00:30:52	Oh, yes... that poor girl.
389	00:30:53	00:30:56	I saw her on the news. It's terrible.
390	00:30:59	00:31:00	These girls, do you recognize any of them?
391	00:31:02	00:31:04	Are those girls dead?
392	00:31:04	00:31:07	We need you to look carefully at those, ma'am.
393	00:31:14	00:31:16	I'm sorry. I don't recognize them.
394	00:31:16	00:31:22	Well, we're going to have to see your patient files from 1975 to '99.
395	00:31:22	00:31:23	Oh, well, I'm sorry.
396	00:31:23	00:31:26	Inactive files aren't kept past seven years.
397	00:31:26	00:31:27	We just don't have the space.
398	00:31:27	00:31:30	Can you tell us who worked on Veronica Sorensen?
399	00:31:30	00:31:32	I'll have to check.
400	00:31:33	00:31:35	We have several dentists on staff.
401	00:31:35	00:31:38	Even a few dental students who volunteer.
402	00:31:39	00:31:41	There we are.
403	00:31:42	00:31:45	She saw Dr. Dave.
404	00:31:45	00:31:46	That's Dr. David Lowry.
405	00:31:47	00:31:49	Everyone around here calls him Dr. Dave.
406	00:31:49	00:31:51	How long has Dr. Dave been working here?
407	00:31:51	00:31:53	Oh, as long as I have.
408	00:31:53	00:31:56	And I'm going on my 32nd year.
409	00:31:56	00:31:57	Could you ask him to step out, please?
410	00:31:57	00:31:58	We'd like to speak with him.
411	00:31:59	00:32:01	15.
412	00:32:01	00:32:04	He's at the Quality Cafe, around the corner on Fremont.
413	00:32:04	00:32:09	Second booth on the left facing the counter.
414	00:32:09	00:32:11	The man is nothing if not predictable.
415	00:32:14	00:32:16	Dr. David Lowry?
416	00:32:16	00:32:18	Everybody calls me Dr. Dave.
417	00:32:18	00:32:20	I'm Catherine Willows.
418	00:32:20	00:32:23	This is Michael Keppler. We're from the Crime Lab.
419	00:32:23	00:32:25	Please, join me.
420	00:32:25	00:32:26	Thank you.
421	00:32:29	00:32:33	Dr. Lowry, we'd like to ask you about one of your patients...
422	00:32:33	00:32:34	Veronica Sorensen.
423	00:32:35	00:32:38	Is this your work?
424	00:32:38	00:32:40	That was a very sad business.
425	00:32:41	00:32:44	She was a lovely, young girl. (sighs)
426	00:32:44	00:32:46	She had a gum-line cavity.
427	00:32:46	00:33:01	Now, normally, I would have used enamel resin to match the teeth, but this was on the inside of her mouth, so I used amalgam to fill it because it was less expensive, and she was worried about the cost, and...
428	00:33:01	00:33:05	her bill was never paid.
429	00:33:06	00:33:08	Are these your work as well?
430	00:33:10	00:33:13	I have no idea-- I was...
431	00:33:13	00:33:16	I was seeing a lot of patients over the years.
432	00:33:18	00:33:21	Do you know their names? I mean, that might ring a bell.
433	00:33:21	00:33:24	No, we don't know who they are.
434	00:33:26	00:33:27	Do you ever use chloral hydrate?
435	00:33:27	00:33:31	No one uses chloral hydrate anymore. It's too dangerous.
436	00:33:33	00:33:35	Hmm...
437	00:33:37	00:33:39	I just feel so awful.
438	00:33:39	00:33:41	Why is that?
439	00:33:41	00:33:43	I brightened her smile.
440	00:33:45	00:33:48	Perhaps that's what attracted her predator.
441	00:33:52	00:33:54	Oh, well...
442	00:33:54	00:33:59	you'll forgive, but if you don't have any more questions, I really should get back to my office.
443	00:34:03	00:34:05	Whoever did your mouth...
444	00:34:05	00:34:07	he does lovely work.
445	00:34:11	00:34:13	See you tomorrow, Dr. Dave.
446	00:34:18	00:34:20	I don't know, kind of reminds me of my Uncle Ralph.
447	00:34:20	00:34:24	Except for the serial killer part, I hope.
448	00:34:26	00:34:29	Haven't seen him in a while. Who knows?
449	00:35:15	00:35:18	In the original photograph, it would've looked like a severe bruise.
450	00:35:18	00:35:20	But there's a lot of information in the negative.
451	00:35:20	00:35:24	You know, back in the day, they didn't have the capability to see this stuff.
452	00:35:24	00:35:27	Pretty distinct impressions of the six upper teeth.
453	00:35:27	00:35:28	Yeah.
454	00:35:28	00:35:31	And here, there's a small gap between the two front teeth.
455	00:35:31	00:35:34	Did Dr. Dave have a space between his teeth?
456	00:35:34	00:35:36	I don't remember.
457	00:35:36	00:35:39	But you can't go in there, because he's with a patient.
458	00:35:45	00:35:48	Dr. Lowry, would you please come with us?
459	00:35:50	00:35:55	Euginia has been seeing me for, um, how many years, my dear?
460	00:35:58	00:36:01	I think it's much longer than that.
461	00:36:01	00:36:04	I'd like to finish Euginia up before the Novocain wears off.
462	00:36:04	00:36:08	We've got a court order to collect a bite impression from you.
463	00:36:08	00:36:11	Is this about these young girls?
464	00:36:11	00:36:13	I think you know what this is about, Dr. Lowry.
465	00:36:13	00:36:16	You're gonna need to come down to the crime lab with us.
466	00:36:16	00:36:19	Bite impression.
467	00:36:19	00:36:20	Couldn't we just do that here?
468	00:36:20	00:36:29	It'll save us all a lot of time and trouble, unless of course, embarrassing me in front of my patient is your real intent.
469	00:36:35	00:36:36	Fine.
470	00:36:36	00:36:39	Okay. Euginia?
471	00:36:40	00:36:45	I'm going to have you wait in Exam Four, and I'll be in there in just a short while.
472	00:36:45	00:36:48	(grunting) No, come on, let's go.
473	00:36:48	00:36:49	Let's see, just...
474	00:36:49	00:36:52	And you know the upper right teeth we worked on?
475	00:36:52	00:36:54	Well, they're looking fine.
476	00:37:02	00:37:03	That's too much water.
477	00:37:04	00:37:06	It will never set.
478	00:37:06	00:37:10	We've got time.
479	00:37:10	00:37:14	Young lady, please, please, please, let me do this.
480	00:37:14	00:37:15	I have much more practice.
481	00:37:15	00:37:18	Be my guest.
482	00:37:21	00:37:23	You know...
483	00:37:23	00:37:28	I don't believe courts accept bite mark evidence much anymore.
484	00:37:28	00:37:34	No, they'd much rather have DNA from saliva around a wound.
485	00:37:34	00:37:36	I've gotten convictions from bite marks.
486	00:37:36	00:37:40	Not many, I suspect.
487	00:37:42	00:37:48	Do you know that our teeth continuously migrate through our entire life?
488	00:37:51	00:37:54	Yes.
489	00:37:54	00:37:58	Dental forensics is definitely an inexact science.
490	00:38:25	00:38:29	We could probably match four out of six.
491	00:38:29	00:38:31	That's not enough for a conviction.
492	00:38:32	00:38:34	Has to be.
493	00:38:34	00:38:36	It's all we've got.
494	00:38:38	00:38:41	The killer's left front incisor is misaligned.
495	00:38:41	00:38:44	Dr. Dave's smile is perfect.
496	00:38:44	00:38:48	Would you go to a dentist with bad teeth?
497	00:38:53	00:38:55	So we're all on the same page, right?
498	00:38:55	00:38:57	About giving the names of these girls?
499	00:38:57	00:38:58	Yes.
500	00:38:58	00:39:01	So, Mike, the Viewing Room is down the end of the hall.
501	00:39:01	00:39:03	Wait, why don't you go in and I'll watch.
502	00:39:03	00:39:05	What makes you think he's gonna talk to me?
503	00:39:05	00:39:08	Because I have a pretty good feeling he's not gonna talk to me.
504	00:39:08	00:39:10	All right.
505	00:39:16	00:39:24	Dr. Lowry, I'd like to show you a bite impression that we're using as evidence in the Sorensen case.
506	00:39:24	00:39:26	There are similarities.
507	00:39:26	00:39:28	But I don't think it's conclusive.
508	00:39:28	00:39:29	Yes.
509	00:39:29	00:39:38	The left front incisor doesn't match, and there's a sizable gap between the two front teeth.
510	00:39:38	00:39:40	But then we found these.
511	00:39:40	00:39:41	We subpoenaed your personal records.
512	00:39:42	00:39:43	You go to a good dentist.
513	00:39:43	00:39:51	In late 1989, you had a cosmetic surgery to repair a sizable gap between your two front teeth.
514	00:39:52	00:39:54	Diastema. It's called diastema.
515	00:39:54	00:40:03	We used the X-rays taken before the procedure to modify your dental model so that it matched the configuration of your teeth in 1989.
516	00:40:04	00:40:05	This is the new overlay.
517	00:40:10	00:40:12	Very impressive.
518	00:40:15	00:40:17	You make a good case.
519	00:40:17	00:40:19	Wasn't easy, Dr. Lowry.
520	00:40:19	00:40:21	You cover your tracks well.
521	00:40:21	00:40:24	Dr. Dave, please, call me Dr. Dave.
522	00:40:27	00:40:32	Jane Doe in 1975, Jane Doe in 1989, and Jane Doe, 1999.
523	00:40:32	00:40:36	Three girls without identities.
524	00:40:36	00:40:37	You were the last person to see them alive.
525	00:40:37	00:40:38	You know their names.
526	00:40:38	00:40:41	Tell us.
527	00:40:41	00:40:45	You have two daughters, don't you, Dr. Lowry?
528	00:40:47	00:40:51	This is the most cryptic conversation I've had since dental school.
529	00:40:51	00:40:53	All right, let me clear it up for you.
530	00:40:53	00:40:57	The last time you moved as a free man was when you walked into this room.
531	00:40:57	00:40:59	When you leave here, you're gonna be charged with murder.
532	00:40:59	00:41:05	So do yourself a favor, give us the identity of these three girls, and you might spare yourself the death penalty.
533	00:41:05	00:41:08	At my age, I'll die before that happens.
534	00:41:08	00:41:11	So what do you have to lose?
535	00:41:11	00:41:16	I don't want to degrade the sweetness of my memories.
536	00:41:18	00:41:20	My memories are all I have left.
537	00:41:21	00:41:25	I can't imagine that you didn't feel something for these girls at some point.
538	00:41:25	00:41:28	We're just asking you to help us return them to their families.
539	00:41:28	00:41:31	What benefit would I get from doing this?
540	00:41:31	00:41:33	You might sleep better at night.
541	00:41:33	00:41:37	I sleep fine, thank you very much.
542	00:41:37	00:41:41	I've always considered that a key to my good health.
543	00:41:41	00:41:43	So none of this bothers you?
544	00:41:45	00:41:48	My life has been blessed.
545	00:41:48	00:41:50	I was married to a kind woman.
546	00:41:50	00:41:52	Just lost her a few years ago.
547	00:41:52	00:41:54	We raised two children.
548	00:41:54	00:41:57	One of them is an oral surgeon, the other one is a homemaker.
549	00:41:57	00:42:00	And you don't care how this might affect them?
550	00:42:00	00:42:02	They'll be horrified, of course.
551	00:42:02	00:42:05	They're not monsters.
552	00:42:05	00:42:08	Well, I'm sure the judge will take that into consideration.
553	00:42:08	00:42:10	You're not listening.
554	00:42:10	00:42:13	I don't feel bad about what I've done.
555	00:42:13	00:42:20	I feel disappointed that I've been caught, but I tend to take the long view of things.
556	00:42:20	00:42:30	I've had a wonderful life, and I know that all things human eventually must end.
557	00:43:16	00:43:20	You have seven new messages.
