0	00:00:05	00:00:06	Okay, we're rolling.
1	00:00:08	00:00:10	Let's go! (laughs)
2	00:00:16	00:00:19	Un, deux, et trois!
3	00:00:27	00:00:28	Whoo!
4	00:00:28	00:00:29	Come back, come back!
5	00:00:29	00:00:31	Now!
6	00:00:31	00:00:34	Come together! Whoo-hoo!
7	00:00:36	00:00:38	And break!
8	00:00:38	00:00:40	Bye-bye!
9	00:00:40	00:00:41	Whoo!
10	00:00:41	00:00:43	Whoo!
11	00:01:17	00:01:18	Buddy, are you all right?!
12	00:01:18	00:01:19	Are you alive?!
13	00:01:20	00:01:22	All right, don't move!
14	00:01:25	00:01:27	Pierre! Oh, my God!
15	00:01:27	00:01:29	Where the hell is the ambulance!
16	00:01:29	00:01:32	Go, go call an ambulance! Go!
17	00:01:32	00:01:33	Okay, help, somebody!
18	00:01:33	00:01:35	Pierre, baby, baby, are you okay?
19	00:01:38	00:01:40	It's all right, sir, do you feel your legs?
20	00:01:40	00:01:42	I'm gonna check his airway. His airway's good.
21	00:01:42	00:01:46	Sir, I'm gonna take your helmet off.
22	00:01:46	00:01:49	Careful. It's okay, sir. Do you know where you are?
23	00:01:51	00:01:53	Let's get that airway. Let's get that airway package.
24	00:01:53	00:01:55	Let's get the backboard. Do you understand me, sir?
25	00:02:05	00:02:07	We're crime scene investigators, Sheriff.
26	00:02:07	00:02:09	We don't normally get called out on something like this.
27	00:02:09	00:02:11	But I'm telling you, this is a crime.
28	00:02:12	00:02:15	Look, I know the jumper, all right?
29	00:02:15	00:02:19	Pierre Delongue and I served together in the French Foreign Legion.
30	00:02:19	00:02:23	What? It's a real thing.
31	00:02:23	00:02:25	Pierre's logged over 1,500 jumps.
32	00:02:25	00:02:28	He's absolutely fanatical about preparation and safety.
33	00:02:28	00:02:32	His school hasn't had a single citation of any kind.
34	00:02:32	00:02:37	You know what? He-he's too careful to have something like this happen by accident.
35	00:02:37	00:02:39	All right.
36	00:02:39	00:02:40	We're gonna need to talk to some witnesses.
37	00:02:40	00:02:42	I'll round 'em up.
38	00:02:45	00:02:47	What do you got, Riley?
39	00:02:47	00:02:49	A helmet videocam.
40	00:02:49	00:02:51	I think it's still on.
41	00:02:57	00:02:59	You gonna help us out here?
42	00:03:33	00:03:35	Ma'am, we just need to know what happened.
43	00:03:35	00:03:38	I'm sorry. I just... I'm really emotional about this.
44	00:03:38	00:03:40	I just need a moment.
45	00:03:40	00:03:42	It's okay. Take your time.
46	00:03:42	00:03:45	Did Pierre give any indication that there was anything wrong during the jump?
47	00:03:45	00:03:46	I don't know what happened.
48	00:03:46	00:03:49	You know, we've made this jump, like, a hundred times.
49	00:03:49	00:03:51	Everything was going perfect.
50	00:03:51	00:04:00	We formed the star, backflipped, 360'd, reformed exactly as planned.
51	00:04:00	00:04:04	We deployed, but...
52	00:04:04	00:04:06	he just kept falling.
53	00:04:08	00:04:10	Everything was perfect, it was like...
54	00:04:10	00:04:13	Well, did you ever do it?
55	00:04:13	00:04:15	Well, I've done a little paragliding.
56	00:04:15	00:04:17	Oh, you should try the real thing.
57	00:04:17	00:04:19	You know, bodies linked in air.
58	00:04:19	00:04:27	And... And the Earth coming at you like the fist of death, and the wind is, like, it blows up your leg holes.
59	00:04:27	00:04:30	Pierre lived for that.
60	00:04:38	00:04:39	Bonjour.
61	00:04:42	00:04:43	They told me Pierre have an accident.
62	00:04:43	00:04:45	Yeah. Who are you?
63	00:04:45	00:04:47	I'm Max Girard, Pierre's partner.
64	00:04:47	00:04:51	Pierre and I, we have a jump school there.
65	00:04:56	00:04:57	Is he dead?
66	00:04:58	00:05:00	He's at Desert Palm, man. He's in pretty bad shape.
67	00:05:00	00:05:04	(sobs) At least we can take comfort in the fact that he died doing what he loved.
68	00:05:04	00:05:05	He's not dead yet.
69	00:05:06	00:05:07	Regard...
70	00:05:07	00:05:10	Pierre and I are brothers.
71	00:05:10	00:05:12	Not really brothers, but like brothers.
72	00:05:12	00:05:18	We come here together from Belgium, we build this business.
73	00:05:18	00:05:20	What happened to your leg?
74	00:05:20	00:05:22	Same thing that happened to my car.
75	00:05:22	00:05:23	It's nothing.
76	00:05:25	00:05:27	I will go to see my partner.
77	00:05:27	00:05:28	I want to go, too. So do I.
78	00:05:28	00:05:30	Sir, we may need to talk to you later.
79	00:05:30	00:05:31	Where can we find you?
80	00:05:31	00:05:33	At the hospital.
81	00:05:33	00:05:35	At Pierre's side.
82	00:05:35	00:05:37	Hey, les deux, into the car.
83	00:05:41	00:05:43	Go, go, go, go!
84	00:05:43	00:05:44	So what do you think?
85	00:05:44	00:05:51	I think if you jump out of a plane enough times, that one day, one way or another, your luck's gonna run out.
86	00:06:08	00:06:16	When I first noticed Cathartes aura, the common turkey vulture, I assumed they were scavenging, some, uh, large desert mammal.
87	00:06:16	00:06:19	When I got closer...
88	00:06:19	00:06:21	imagine my dismay.
89	00:06:23	00:06:26	And exactly what were you doing out here all alone, sir?
90	00:06:26	00:06:29	I'm a landscape photographer.
91	00:06:29	00:06:34	I used to be a bird-watcher, but I gave it up-- too much death.
92	00:06:50	00:06:55	The DB is a white male, probably in his 30s.
93	00:06:55	00:07:01	Exposed flesh on the face, neck, arms, legs appears to be scavenged.
94	00:07:01	00:07:05	The eye sockets are empty and bloody.
95	00:07:05	00:07:08	Uh, birds of prey always go for the eyeballs first.
96	00:07:08	00:07:16	Yes. They're moist, nutritious, easily reachable, well before the hide has a chance to ripen and burst.
97	00:07:16	00:07:20	The victim's clothing suggests a person of a religious or ascetic nature.
98	00:07:21	00:07:26	The legs are folded in the lotus position; he may have been meditating when he died.
99	00:07:26	00:07:35	Amongst the various animal tracks, consistent with the predation, there is a single set of shoe impressions leading to the body.
100	00:07:35	00:07:38	I swear, I never got any closer than this.
101	00:07:38	00:07:39	Will you lift your feet, please?
102	00:07:41	00:07:47	Officer, you walked in to check out the body and walked out using your own steps?
103	00:07:47	00:07:48	I took a class.
104	00:07:50	00:07:54	There is a single set of barefoot human tracks.
105	00:07:54	00:07:59	I will document them, determine whether they belong to the victim.
106	00:07:59	00:08:10	There appear to be no other tracks, but judging from the sandy quality of the terrain, it is possible someone walked in and covered their tracks on the way out.
107	00:08:10	00:08:13	Such a lonely place to die.
108	00:08:13	00:08:16	What place isn't, my friend? What place isn't?
109	00:08:25	00:08:30	We find at least a couple guys like this out in the desert every year.
110	00:08:30	00:08:33	The sands tends to call out to the spiritually inclined.
111	00:08:33	00:08:37	It's all very biblical and very dusty.
112	00:08:37	00:08:39	He had plenty of water.
113	00:08:39	00:08:42	So I guess he didn't die of dehydration.
114	00:08:42	00:08:43	Hmm.
115	00:08:45	00:08:48	Pistachios. My favorite nut.
116	00:08:48	00:08:50	Salty and easy to open.
117	00:08:50	00:08:54	Speaking of which... shall we?
118	00:08:54	00:08:55	Indeed.
119	00:09:11	00:09:13	Nice ink.
120	00:09:13	00:09:16	Holy Steven.
121	00:09:29	00:09:33	Spread the word. I am come.
122	00:09:33	00:09:35	And you is gone.
123	00:10:03	00:10:05	Hey.
124	00:10:06	00:10:06	Hey.
125	00:10:07	00:10:09	How's the jumper?
126	00:10:09	00:10:14	Well, you could ask his pelvis, which you will find in his rib cage.
127	00:10:14	00:10:21	His neck is broken, his legs are broken, his ribs and fingers are broken.
128	00:10:21	00:10:23	Basically, all of him is broken.
129	00:10:23	00:10:25	Is he still in surgery?
130	00:10:25	00:10:26	Yeah.
131	00:10:26	00:10:28	Okay.
132	00:10:28	00:10:29	Here's what I got.
133	00:10:29	00:10:33	This is Pierre's rig, and this is an identical, properly-packed chute.
134	00:10:33	00:10:37	Uh, we know the EMS team cut Pierre out of his rig before they moved him.
135	00:10:37	00:10:40	But the canopy is only connected to the harness on one side.
136	00:10:40	00:10:42	That would've tangled the chute.
137	00:10:43	00:10:46	Main chute rip cord's here, cutaway harness here.
138	00:10:46	00:10:47	Both were deployed.
139	00:10:47	00:10:48	Okay, hold on.
140	00:10:48	00:10:50	What's a cutaway?
141	00:10:50	00:10:53	Okay, the cutaway mechanism's designed to release the canopy from the harness entirely.
142	00:10:53	00:10:57	It's not meant to be deployed in mid-air, unless this main chute here is tangled.
143	00:11:01	00:11:05	So if it was deployed, why didn't the main chute detach completely?
144	00:11:05	00:11:07	Because of this pull-up cord right here.
145	00:11:07	00:11:15	It's designed to crimp these straps together on the chute while packing it. It's then released before the jumper puts on the harness.
146	00:11:15	00:11:21	But on Pierre's chute, a little piece of it's broken off, preventing the three-ring mechanism from releasing the riser.
147	00:11:21	00:11:24	So what you're saying is it's simple equipment failure?
148	00:11:24	00:11:27	If that were the only thing wrong, yeah, I would be.
149	00:11:27	00:11:29	But Pierre's reserve chute was still packed.
150	00:11:29	00:11:32	It failed to deploy, even though he pulled the reserve handle.
151	00:11:32	00:11:33	How do you know that?
152	00:11:33	00:11:36	Because of this little cable.
153	00:11:36	00:11:39	It's supposed to have a crimped cap on the end, like this.
154	00:11:39	00:11:45	Without it, the wire goes through the reserve chute's D-ring without activating it.
155	00:11:45	00:11:51	I'm telling you, the odds against a double failure like this are astronomical.
156	00:11:51	00:11:54	I thought these guys were fanatical about checking their own equipment.
157	00:11:54	00:11:55	They're supposed to be.
158	00:11:55	00:12:01	I'll swab these release mechanisms for touch DNA and see if anybody else put their paws on Pierre's stuff.
159	00:12:01	00:12:02	I'm thinking somebody...
160	00:12:02	00:12:04	...messed with his chute.
161	00:12:04	00:12:05	Yeah.
162	00:12:05	00:12:09	All of the animal bites were postmortem.
163	00:12:10	00:12:17	I found teeth impressions-- probably coyotes as well as beaked birds of prey-- but they didn't get very far.
164	00:12:17	00:12:19	He wasn't dead very long.
165	00:12:19	00:12:22	When I got there, rigor was still full.
166	00:12:22	00:12:25	Interesting.
167	00:12:25	00:12:27	Amoeboid-shaped bleed on the cerebrum.
168	00:12:28	00:12:32	Spans the junction of the motor cortex and the sensory cortex. Hmm...
169	00:12:43	00:12:44	It runs deep.
170	00:12:44	00:12:48	Yeah, hematoma's definitely large enough to be COD.
171	00:12:48	00:12:50	Corresponds to this injury here.
172	00:12:50	00:12:53	That doesn't look like an animal bite.
173	00:12:53	00:12:56	More likely blunt force trauma.
174	00:12:56	00:12:58	You're saying someone cracked him on the top of his head?
175	00:12:58	00:13:04	Fall would have caused trauma to the forehead, back or side of the head.
176	00:13:04	00:13:06	This injury's right on top.
177	00:13:06	00:13:09	He was sitting cross-legged when he died.
178	00:13:09	00:13:14	It's virtually impossible to fall and hit the top of your head from that position. (cell phone ringing)
179	00:13:14	00:13:16	Excuse me.
180	00:13:23	00:13:24	This is Langston.
181	00:13:24	00:13:25	Hey, Professor.
182	00:13:25	00:13:27	Yeah, I was running a check on Holy Steven.
183	00:13:27	00:13:28	He wasn't hard to find.
184	00:13:28	00:13:30	He likes to preach at downtown shelters.
185	00:13:30	00:13:34	Anyway, his name is not, uh, Steven, by the way.
186	00:13:34	00:13:38	It's, uh, Mark VonGrovestreet.
187	00:13:38	00:13:39	Why'd he change it?
188	00:13:39	00:13:41	I have no idea.
189	00:13:41	00:13:42	Anyway, I have an address.
190	00:13:42	00:13:44	You might like to come along.
191	00:14:29	00:14:31	Hi. Las Vegas Police.
192	00:14:31	00:14:32	I'm Detective Jim Brass.
193	00:14:32	00:14:34	This is Ray Langston from the crime lab.
194	00:14:34	00:14:35	Welcome.
195	00:14:35	00:14:38	Welcome, welcome, welcome, siblings.
196	00:14:38	00:14:40	Welcome to The Church of the Holy George.
197	00:14:40	00:14:41	And you are, uh...?
198	00:14:41	00:14:43	He.
199	00:14:43	00:14:45	George.
200	00:14:45	00:14:46	Here, please.
201	00:14:46	00:14:48	Thank you, George. Please...
202	00:14:48	00:14:51	What happened to The Church of the Holy Steven?
203	00:14:51	00:14:53	Oh, have you not heard the word?
204	00:14:53	00:14:56	No, The Steven is the divine Second Coming.
205	00:14:56	00:15:00	He is the mouthpiece and messenger and clarion of God.
206	00:15:01	00:15:02	He's also dead.
207	00:15:02	00:15:03	Oh.
208	00:15:03	00:15:04	Yeah.
209	00:15:04	00:15:07	You don't seem too surprised to hear that. Why is that?
210	00:15:07	00:15:08	I had a vision that it was so.
211	00:15:08	00:15:10	Oh, really? Okay.
212	00:15:10	00:15:12	So, when was the last time you saw him?
213	00:15:12	00:15:13	I mean, other than your dream.
214	00:15:13	00:15:14	Huh?
215	00:15:27	00:15:27	George? (gasps)
216	00:15:28	00:15:30	Oh. (laughs)
217	00:15:30	00:15:35	Yes, The Steven and I wandered in the desert for three days and two nights.
218	00:15:35	00:15:45	On the third day, The Steven instructed me to return to spread his word as my own to the people of the cities and towns.
219	00:15:45	00:15:52	And he bestowed his staff upon me, and then he continued on into the desert alone.
220	00:15:55	00:16:01	I held his rod and staff, and I saw that it was good.
221	00:16:03	00:16:13	But then I wept, for I knew that Steven's quest was for reabsorption into the Total Animal Soup of Time.
222	00:16:13	00:16:17	You mean you knew that The Steven was going to die?
223	00:16:17	00:16:19	Oh, no.
224	00:16:19	00:16:22	There is no death, only transmogrification.
225	00:16:22	00:16:23	Well, that's a relief.
226	00:16:25	00:16:27	So, uh, when did all this happen?
227	00:16:27	00:16:28	Uh, what's today?
228	00:16:29	00:16:30	Friday. Yes.
229	00:16:30	00:16:33	We left on Saturday, and then I returned on, uh, Tuesday.
230	00:16:33	00:16:35	And that's when you renamed your church.
231	00:16:35	00:16:37	I... I did.
232	00:16:37	00:16:38	You saw.
233	00:16:38	00:16:41	Yes, I did.
234	00:16:41	00:16:42	Is that the staff there?
235	00:16:42	00:16:43	Oh, yes it is.
236	00:16:43	00:16:44	Indeed, it is.
237	00:16:44	00:16:46	Wow, this is just like Sunday school.
238	00:16:46	00:16:49	Here's the Gospel according to Jim...
239	00:16:50	00:16:55	I think you took that staff and clubbed the Holy Steve like a baby harp seal...
240	00:16:55	00:16:57	so you could become the number one sky pilot...
241	00:17:00	00:17:02	...and take over this whole operation.
242	00:17:02	00:17:04	Hmm... You do?
243	00:17:04	00:17:05	Yes, I do.
244	00:17:05	00:17:07	Yes.
245	00:17:08	00:17:10	Yes, I did.
246	00:17:10	00:17:17	I raised the staff, as Abraham to Isaac, but there was no angel to stay my hand, so... I smote him.
247	00:17:18	00:17:19	You smote him.
248	00:17:19	00:17:20	You realize that's a confession, George?
249	00:17:20	00:17:22	You understand that, right?
250	00:17:22	00:17:23	Yes, yes.
251	00:17:23	00:17:24	Are you, are you going to arrest me?
252	00:17:24	00:17:26	Yes, I am.
253	00:17:26	00:17:27	Yes.
254	00:17:27	00:17:28	Yes.
255	00:17:36	00:17:38	Okay, testing, testing.
256	00:17:38	00:17:43	Uh, what did one dehydrated Frenchman say to the other?
257	00:17:43	00:17:45	What do you want me to do, Pee Air?
258	00:17:47	00:17:48	Okay, let's go.
259	00:17:48	00:17:50	Pierre, you're so funny!
260	00:17:50	00:17:53	It all looks like standard operating procedure.
261	00:17:53	00:17:55	Hello, mon 'ti chou.
262	00:17:56	00:17:57	Hello.
263	00:17:57	00:17:58	Hey, baby.
264	00:17:58	00:18:00	Okay... (speaks French)
265	00:18:00	00:18:03	Looks like a little bit of tension between the two ladies there.
266	00:18:03	00:18:06	Mm-hmm.
267	00:18:10	00:18:13	Hold on, freeze it, right there.
268	00:18:13	00:18:14	Look at their hands.
269	00:18:14	00:18:21	Either one of those chicks could have deployed Pierre's cutaway release right there in free fall, after he'd already checked his rig on the plane.
270	00:18:21	00:18:23	You ever think about skydiving?
271	00:18:23	00:18:25	Not anymore.
272	00:18:25	00:18:27	Keep playing it.
273	00:18:47	00:18:51	I think it's about time I had a little chat with the ladies.
274	00:18:51	00:18:58	Pierre, Max, Mink and me, we were like, we were like one big happy family.
275	00:18:58	00:19:00	Closer, even.
276	00:19:00	00:19:04	We trusted each other with our lives every day.
277	00:19:04	00:19:06	Oh.
278	00:19:08	00:19:11	Ah...
279	00:19:13	00:19:17	We all loved each other so much.
280	00:19:17	00:19:21	Pierre loved to make me laugh.
281	00:19:21	00:19:23	He was so funny.
282	00:19:23	00:19:27	Pee Air-- get it, Pierre?
283	00:19:27	00:19:29	He was a wild man.
284	00:19:29	00:19:33	Big where it counts-- in his heart.
285	00:19:33	00:19:37	I mean, I don't even know what I'm doing here.
286	00:19:37	00:19:42	My fiancÃ© is dying, and I just don't understand what all of you people want from me.
287	00:19:42	00:19:44	FiancÃ©? Wait.
288	00:19:44	00:19:46	She called him that? She called him her fiancÃ©?
289	00:19:46	00:19:48	She doesn't even speak French.
290	00:19:48	00:19:51	He was never gonna marry her.
291	00:19:51	00:19:54	That pathetic, deluded bitch!
292	00:19:54	00:19:56	She called me a bitch?
293	00:19:56	00:19:58	That... ...bitch!
294	00:19:58	00:20:03	She thinks that I don't know what she was doing-- sneaking around, trying to take him away from me.
295	00:20:04	00:20:05	I am the one he loved.
296	00:20:05	00:20:07	He was just doing her out of pity.
297	00:20:07	00:20:09	Pity? She said that?
298	00:20:09	00:20:10	Unbelievable.
299	00:20:10	00:20:13	What a slut.
300	00:20:13	00:20:15	You know what I think?
301	00:20:15	00:20:18	I think maybe you killed Pierre out of jealousy.
302	00:20:18	00:20:20	What?
303	00:20:20	00:20:21	You heard me.
304	00:20:21	00:20:23	Really?
305	00:20:25	00:20:27	Eh, don't let either of them fool you.
306	00:20:27	00:20:31	In my opinion, they could have decided to kill him together.
307	00:20:31	00:20:34	Just to get off on watching him die.
308	00:20:34	00:20:38	They're both conniving, diseased, camel-hooved 'ores.
309	00:20:38	00:20:39	Ore...?
310	00:20:39	00:20:41	Whores. Whores.
311	00:20:49	00:20:51	Well, it's cozy...
312	00:20:51	00:20:53	for a morgue.
313	00:20:53	00:20:55	What do you have for me, Wendy?
314	00:20:55	00:20:59	I got the results from the staff of Holy Steven.
315	00:20:59	00:21:02	Um, I recovered epithelials on the handle, in the normal grip positions.
316	00:21:02	00:21:06	And all the DNA was either from Steven himself or from his disciple, George.
317	00:21:06	00:21:08	What about the business end?
318	00:21:08	00:21:10	Nothing, actually.
319	00:21:10	00:21:16	That's what's weird-- there was no blood from the victim, no epithelials so honestly, I don't think he used that to whack him.
320	00:21:16	00:21:18	Why would he confess to killing Steven with it?
321	00:21:18	00:21:19	I don't know.
322	00:21:19	00:21:22	I want to show you something. Okay.
323	00:21:22	00:21:26	Take a look at this.
324	00:21:26	00:21:28	The Gospel according to Steven.
325	00:21:28	00:21:30	Greetings, siblings.
326	00:21:30	00:21:38	Today we learn the lesson of the barista who taught me-- Steven-- this lesson.
327	00:21:38	00:21:42	I did not want whipped cream on my half-caf venti mocha latte.
328	00:21:42	00:21:51	But when it arrived so and I mentioned it, the barista said, Dude, we're slammed here.
329	00:21:51	00:21:54	Can't you just spoon it out?
330	00:21:54	00:21:59	And I realized I could, and I did.
331	00:21:59	00:22:06	And thus, I freed myself of the conflict that would afflict all the other good people in line.
332	00:22:06	00:22:18	So remember, siblings, in all things, be supple of thought and pliant of deed...
333	00:22:18	00:22:22	The central tenets of this faith seem to be based on the concept of acquiescence.
334	00:22:22	00:22:24	Well, I suppose there are worse things to base a religion on.
335	00:22:24	00:22:26	I suppose so.
336	00:22:29	00:22:31	You don't think he did it. No.
337	00:22:31	00:22:34	But I think the power of Steven may have compelled him.
338	00:22:34	00:22:39	So according to this, you said that you struck The Steven with his staff.
339	00:22:39	00:22:41	You smote him.
340	00:22:47	00:22:48	That isn't true, is it?
341	00:22:48	00:22:50	Yeah... no.
342	00:22:51	00:22:54	What did you hit him with?
343	00:22:56	00:22:58	Oh, it says here a large rock.
344	00:22:58	00:23:00	Yes. No, wait a minute, a branch of a tree.
345	00:23:00	00:23:02	Yes. No, a hockey stick.
346	00:23:02	00:23:03	Yes.
347	00:23:05	00:23:07	You didn't really kill Steven, did you?
348	00:23:08	00:23:09	No.
349	00:23:09	00:23:10	So why did you confess to murder?
350	00:23:10	00:23:16	Well, I try to live my life according to the 17th Proclamation of The Steven.
351	00:23:16	00:23:18	From his second sermon at the Starbucks.
352	00:23:18	00:23:19	Oh, I missed that one.
353	00:23:19	00:23:21	It is better to be...
354	00:23:21	00:23:24	agreeable than to be right.
355	00:23:24	00:23:26	That's not religion, that's marriage.
356	00:23:28	00:23:29	That's... very...
357	00:23:31	00:23:33	So you didn't kill Steven?
358	00:23:33	00:23:34	Yes... no.
359	00:23:34	00:23:36	You did? Yes.
360	00:23:36	00:23:37	You killed him? No.
361	00:23:37	00:23:40	Are you clinically insane or just incredibly annoying?
362	00:23:40	00:23:41	What would you prefer?
363	00:23:44	00:23:48	Look, would you mind submitting to a psychological evaluation?
364	00:23:48	00:23:49	No.
365	00:23:49	00:23:51	I don't even know why I asked.
366	00:23:51	00:23:54	So in other words, he's crazy?
367	00:23:54	00:23:59	Or crazy like a fox, or there was evidence of someone else at the scene and I didn't find it.
368	00:23:59	00:24:04	Well, you've got no murder weapon and no other suspects.
369	00:24:04	00:24:07	I mean, maybe your vic just fell over and bumped his head.
370	00:24:07	00:24:08	It's been known to happen.
371	00:24:09	00:24:11	I'm going over to PD to wait for the DHS psychologist.
372	00:24:11	00:24:14	I'll fill him in on Agreeable George. Okay.
373	00:24:14	00:24:15	Hey, Catherine. Yeah?
374	00:24:16	00:24:18	I just caught a double 420 in Seven Hills. Oh!
375	00:24:18	00:24:19	You interested?
376	00:24:19	00:24:21	Let's do it. All right.
377	00:24:26	00:24:27	Okay, we got two dead bodies.
378	00:24:27	00:24:31	The wife discovered the two victims when she returned from LA from visiting her sister.
379	00:24:31	00:24:32	Her name is Gretchen Javid.
380	00:24:32	00:24:34	Oh, you're not listening to me.
381	00:24:34	00:24:36	I am telling you, my husband was never without his bodyguard!
382	00:24:36	00:24:39	Please, please. Hold her. Sir, my husband was never without his bodyguard!
383	00:24:39	00:24:41	And his bodyguard is missing!
384	00:24:41	00:24:42	Please, somebody help her out.
385	00:24:42	00:24:44	Get her some medication.
386	00:24:44	00:24:45	You need to stay calm, ma'am.
387	00:24:45	00:24:47	I'm having an anxiety attack. Help me, please.
388	00:24:47	00:24:50	Officer Akers, uh, was the first respondent on the scene.
389	00:24:53	00:24:56	Okay... so...
390	00:24:56	00:24:59	victim number one is Ismail Javid.
391	00:24:59	00:25:01	He's the owner of the house.
392	00:25:01	00:25:05	And victim number two is his business partner, Allen McKenna.
393	00:25:05	00:25:09	Now, they own a company called Isfahan Marble &amp;amp; Tile.
394	00:25:09	00:25:11	They did the new lobby at the Marrakesh.
395	00:25:12	00:25:13	I've seen it.
396	00:25:13	00:25:14	It's grotesque.
397	00:25:14	00:25:16	This is worse.
398	00:25:19	00:25:21	When I arrived, I found no sign of forced entry.
399	00:25:21	00:25:22	Nothing disturbed in the house.
400	00:25:22	00:25:23	No sign of a struggle.
401	00:25:23	00:25:28	And they still had their wallets, so robbery doesn't seem to be... (gagging)
402	00:25:28	00:25:29	Excuse me. Sorry.
403	00:25:29	00:25:31	Must have been something I ate.
404	00:25:31	00:25:34	Uh, well, I don't need you puking on my crime scene, Andy, so go ahead and take off.
405	00:25:34	00:25:36	I've got it covered here. Thanks.
406	00:25:39	00:25:40	Hey...
407	00:25:40	00:25:44	I don't see any external wounds or injuries, and they're just coming out of rigor.
408	00:25:44	00:25:47	So, they've probably been dead since early last night.
409	00:25:47	00:25:49	Maybe a little longer.
410	00:25:49	00:25:52	Whatever killed them looks like it hurt.
411	00:25:52	00:25:53	Yeah, both their necks are flushed.
412	00:25:53	00:25:56	That's usually a characteristic of heart attack.
413	00:25:56	00:25:57	Simultaneous coronary seizures?
414	00:25:57	00:25:59	That's kind of unlikely, don't you think?
415	00:25:59	00:26:00	Very.
416	00:26:03	00:26:04	Maybe they were poisoned.
417	00:26:04	00:26:05	I'll take that stuff to Tox.
418	00:26:07	00:26:14	So I ran the DNA from the female skydivers against the sample that you took from the, uh...
419	00:26:14	00:26:15	Cutaway handle? Yes, thank you.
420	00:26:15	00:26:17	And anyway, neither one of them was on it.
421	00:26:17	00:26:20	In fact, the only DNA that I did find was from Pierre himself.
422	00:26:20	00:26:21	Really? Mm-hmm.
423	00:26:21	00:26:23	Langston.
424	00:26:23	00:26:27	Hey, yeah, Ray, um, I'm just wondering when you're, uh... going to be getting back here.
425	00:26:27	00:26:29	'Cause, uh... callouts are starting to pile up.
426	00:26:29	00:26:31	Well, I'm all done here.
427	00:26:31	00:26:34	I should be back at the lab in 15, 20 minutes.
428	00:26:34	00:26:36	Oh, perfect... (Akers groans)
429	00:26:36	00:26:37	Ray? Ray, what's going on?
430	00:26:39	00:26:41	This is Dispatch.
431	00:26:41	00:26:43	We need paramedics.
432	00:26:43	00:26:44	I'll take care of him.
433	00:26:51	00:26:54	He was in coronary arrhythmia, very close to full arrest.
434	00:26:54	00:26:56	Is there a history of heart disease?
435	00:26:56	00:26:58	None.
436	00:26:58	00:27:00	Hey, Andy. How you feeling?
437	00:27:00	00:27:01	Fine.
438	00:27:02	00:27:04	Just get somebody to take these wires off, and I'll go home.
439	00:27:04	00:27:07	That's not going to happen anytime soon, son.
440	00:27:07	00:27:15	Andy, I need you to walk me through exactly what you did when you reported to the 420 in Seven Hills.
441	00:27:15	00:27:17	I responded to the call.
442	00:27:17	00:27:21	Arrived first, ahead of EMS.
443	00:27:21	00:27:23	Wife met me at the door.
444	00:27:23	00:27:24	Led me to the backyard.
445	00:27:25	00:27:26	Let me through! Let me through!
446	00:27:26	00:27:30	I checked the vics for pulse, but they were gone.
447	00:27:30	00:27:37	So I taped the scene off and I waited for you guys to show up.
448	00:27:37	00:27:39	Were you wearing gloves?
449	00:27:39	00:27:41	No.
450	00:27:41	00:27:42	And there was no reason to.
451	00:27:42	00:27:44	Wa-Was there?
452	00:27:48	00:27:51	Something at the scene induced heart attacks in both my victims.
453	00:27:51	00:27:53	I think Akers was exposed to it, too.
454	00:27:53	00:27:55	Think it came from something they both touched?
455	00:27:55	00:27:57	Out of the way, please.
456	00:27:57	00:27:59	Clear the way, coming through!
457	00:28:02	00:28:03	I am telling you...!
458	00:28:03	00:28:05	I'm having an anxiety attack. Help me, please.
459	00:28:05	00:28:08	That was the victim's wife.
460	00:28:10	00:28:14	Jim, we need to quarantine the crime scene in Seven Hills.
461	00:28:14	00:28:16	I think there's a contact toxin involved.
462	00:28:16	00:28:18	Include the entire house and adjacent yards.
463	00:28:18	00:28:21	And no one enters without Hazmat.
464	00:28:55	00:29:00	So I found a very faint, powdery trace on all the surfaces I examined.
465	00:29:00	00:29:02	It's a digitoxin.
466	00:29:02	00:29:03	A naturally occurring organic compound.
467	00:29:03	00:29:07	It's a cardiac glycoside. Used in heart medication.
468	00:29:08	00:29:18	Yeah, in small doses it is beneficial to healthy heart function, but in higher doses it causes arrhythmia, and in extreme concentrations, such as those found in the tissues of both vics, death.
469	00:29:18	00:29:21	But fortunately, it becomes inert fairly quickly.
470	00:29:22	00:29:26	Okay, so that explains why Officer Akers and Mrs. Javid survived the exposure.
471	00:29:26	00:29:29	We have to go back and check the yard.
472	00:29:29	00:29:32	Is there a reagent that can detect the digitoxin?
473	00:29:32	00:29:37	Yeah, a diluted solution of perchloric acid exposed to UV light will induce fluorescence.
474	00:29:38	00:29:40	Try saying that ten times fast.
475	00:30:33	00:30:36	The glycosides are completely contained within the backyard.
476	00:30:36	00:30:39	What does that dispersal pattern suggest to you?
477	00:30:39	00:30:43	Well, that the house was targeted and that the toxins were dropped from above.
478	00:30:43	00:30:45	Yeah, yeah, that's what we think.
479	00:30:46	00:30:51	Well... you had said that the victims looked like they were caught completely unaware.
480	00:30:51	00:30:55	What kind of aircraft can fly that low and that quiet without them even noticing?
481	00:30:55	00:30:57	Way ahead of you, Hodges.
482	00:30:57	00:30:59	Ultralights.
483	00:30:59	00:31:03	They're extremely maneuverable, and able to fly very slow without stalling.
484	00:31:03	00:31:11	If they used one of these, they conceivably could have gained altitude, then cut the engine, and glided silently, very low across the yard.
485	00:31:11	00:31:17	Then after the drop, the pilot could have restarted the engine and... landed just about anywhere.
486	00:31:17	00:31:22	We know that the TOD was sometime the night before last.
487	00:31:22	00:31:26	Greg, get me a latitude and longitude for the yard.
488	00:31:26	00:31:27	I got an idea.
489	00:31:38	00:31:45	Okay, I've got tracking data from the tower at McCarran for overflight of latitude...
490	00:31:45	00:31:53	36-10-27, longitude 1-22- 15-10 at 2238 hours the day before yesterday.
491	00:31:53	00:31:55	There's one ultralight in the area.
492	00:31:55	00:32:02	And that's where the craft dropped off radar when it descended and dropped the digitoxin.
493	00:32:02	00:32:04	I wonder how they knew the vics would even be there.
494	00:32:05	00:32:06	Bodyguard must have tipped them off.
495	00:32:07	00:32:12	Did the craft transponder relay any registration info?
496	00:32:14	00:32:15	I'm not getting anything.
497	00:32:15	00:32:18	Can you widen the view and show me where they went?
498	00:32:29	00:32:31	He headed towards Denim Field.
499	00:32:31	00:32:34	Also the apparent point of origin.
500	00:32:34	00:32:36	That must be where he landed.
501	00:32:36	00:32:39	Let's check out the perspective view.
502	00:32:39	00:32:43	Whoever was piloting it brought it in on this ancillary runway.
503	00:32:43	00:32:44	Private airstrip.
504	00:32:45	00:32:46	No security.
505	00:32:46	00:32:48	Wait.
506	00:32:48	00:32:49	Go back.
507	00:32:49	00:32:51	There.
508	00:32:56	00:32:57	Stokes.
509	00:32:57	00:33:01	Hey, Nicky, I think your jumper case just got tangled up in mine.
510	00:34:04	00:34:05	Hey, Pierre?
511	00:34:05	00:34:07	Ã§a va?
512	00:34:09	00:34:10	Bonjour, Max.
513	00:34:14	00:34:16	How's the patient?
514	00:34:16	00:34:20	They say maybe, uh, he never walk again, huh?
515	00:34:20	00:34:22	Never speak.
516	00:34:22	00:34:24	Imagine.
517	00:34:26	00:34:28	Ouch. Oh...
518	00:34:28	00:34:31	Can you hear me, Pierre?
519	00:34:34	00:34:35	Yes.
520	00:34:35	00:34:37	Oh.
521	00:34:37	00:34:39	Good.
522	00:34:39	00:34:44	Look... I got a problem, and I think maybe you two guys can help me out.
523	00:34:44	00:34:47	I already told you all that I know about Pierre's accident.
524	00:34:47	00:34:49	No, it's not about the accident.
525	00:34:49	00:34:54	It's about the fact that your glider was used in a poison dump to kill a couple of guys the night before last.
526	00:34:54	00:34:58	Hey, I'm sure I have no idea what you are talking about. Well, maybe not.
527	00:34:58	00:35:02	But I bet Pierre might have something to say about it.
528	00:35:02	00:35:03	There is nothing to tell.
529	00:35:03	00:35:05	Is that right, Pierre?
530	00:35:05	00:35:10	'Cause I get the feeling that you really want to tell us what happened, in every detail. Right?
531	00:35:17	00:35:18	Yes.
532	00:35:18	00:35:21	Pierre, be very careful what you say, my friend, huh?
533	00:35:21	00:35:23	Yeah.
534	00:35:23	00:35:24	Be very careful.
535	00:35:24	00:35:27	Now, tell us what happened, word by word.
536	00:35:28	00:35:30	I don't care how long it takes; I can wait.
537	00:35:31	00:35:33	Was night.
538	00:35:38	00:35:40	Cell ring.
539	00:35:40	00:35:41	Max.
540	00:35:43	00:35:45	He want me to fly.
541	00:35:45	00:35:47	Okay.
542	00:35:47	00:35:48	Okay.
543	00:35:48	00:35:51	There was a man, a very bad man, he want me to fly him at night.
544	00:35:51	00:35:55	Uh-huh. He say, uh, he want to make aerial photography.
545	00:35:55	00:35:58	He offer me $5,000, but I did not believe him.
546	00:35:58	00:36:01	I say no, I have no license to fly at night.
547	00:36:01	00:36:04	But then he get meaner-- he threaten to hurt my family.
548	00:36:04	00:36:07	He knows my children's name, where we live, tout Ã§a.
549	00:36:07	00:36:09	So...
550	00:36:09	00:36:12	I agree to, uh, meet him at the airport.
551	00:36:12	00:36:17	But I was so nervous, I got in car accident.
552	00:36:18	00:36:21	Pierre! Pick up, pick up!
553	00:36:26	00:36:28	Hello?
554	00:36:28	00:36:29	Pierre!
555	00:36:29	00:36:31	For the love of God, just meet (horn honks)
556	00:36:31	00:36:37	this guy at the airfield, take him up in the ultralight, follow directions, and don't ask any questions!
557	00:36:37	00:36:41	I pay you $5,000. I can do this for you, my friend.
558	00:36:41	00:36:43	Merci. Yes, my friend.
559	00:36:46	00:36:47	Pierre...
560	00:36:47	00:36:48	Pierre has business to attend to.
561	00:36:49	00:36:52	Pierre had no idea what was going on. Okay...
562	00:36:52	00:36:54	He said take it down! Now!
563	00:36:54	00:36:55	D'accord!
564	00:36:57	00:36:59	Two million bucks in the bank.
565	00:37:01	00:37:02	Now...
566	00:37:11	00:37:13	Think, uh, it's starting to rain?
567	00:37:13	00:37:15	(coughing, choking) He knew...
568	00:37:15	00:37:18	he had done something terribly wrong.
569	00:37:19	00:37:21	He was very upset.
570	00:37:21	00:37:23	But, uh, I told him to calm himself.
571	00:37:23	00:37:27	I told him, uh, we had to do our jobs and, uh, keep silent.
572	00:37:27	00:37:29	You realize this makes you an accomplice.
573	00:37:29	00:37:30	You know that, right?
574	00:37:30	00:37:32	I understand.
575	00:37:32	00:37:34	But I really had no idea what was going to happen.
576	00:37:34	00:37:37	Did one of the killers mess with your parachute?
577	00:37:37	00:37:39	Did he tamper it in any way?
578	00:37:39	00:37:41	No.
579	00:37:41	00:37:44	It... was...
580	00:37:44	00:37:46	me.
581	00:37:49	00:37:53	Because you couldn't bear what you'd done, and you decided to kill yourself.
582	00:37:53	00:37:58	Yes. You didn't want to be thought of as a coward, so you...
583	00:37:58	00:38:00	rigged your own chute to fail.
584	00:38:00	00:38:04	But even that failed, isn't that so?
585	00:38:04	00:38:05	Yes.
586	00:38:07	00:38:09	Max.
587	00:38:09	00:38:11	I need a name.
588	00:38:11	00:38:26	A professional bodyguard and a second, unidentified man were arrested early this morning for the alleged killing of Ismail Javid and Allen McKenna, co-owners of Isfahan Marble &amp;amp; Stone, just two days ago.
589	00:38:26	00:38:44	There is speculation that the second man, a Kurdish crop duster who was reputedly obsessed with the movie North by Northwest, was hired by the owner of rival Iranian marble importers to kill the men, possibly in a dispute over contracts in the dwindling housing market.
590	00:38:44	00:38:49	Authorities have declined to make a statement Well, there's a story for you.
591	00:38:49	00:38:51	I think I'll sell it to Holly-weird, get rich.
592	00:38:51	00:38:55	I thought we had a trade embargo on...
593	00:38:55	00:39:04	Iranian imports. We do, but those guys just ship the product to a second neutral country in the area, like the UAE, transship it here, resell it to themselves at cost.
594	00:39:04	00:39:09	It's technically legal, and, uh, Commerce turns a blind eye.
595	00:39:09	00:39:13	And then they kill each other here over construction contracts.
596	00:39:13	00:39:15	Those Persian dudes are tough, man.
597	00:39:15	00:39:18	Well, they were once an empire that stretched halfway across the known world.
598	00:39:19	00:39:31	The Greek playwright Aeschylus wrote about the territorial ambitions of the Persian Empire against Greece in his great cycle of tragedy and war, The Persians, um, fifth century, B.C.
599	00:39:31	00:39:35	I will definitely put that on my reading list.
600	00:39:35	00:39:38	Does anyone want to grab some breakfast? Yeah, yep.
601	00:39:38	00:39:40	Why are you always thinking about food?
602	00:39:40	00:39:42	None of you has read Aeschylus?
603	00:39:42	00:39:44	I've been meaning to. Well, you should.
604	00:39:44	00:39:48	He was a writer of tremendous power, great beauty.
605	00:39:48	00:39:49	His death was...
606	00:40:15	00:40:26	As an old man in 456 B.C., Aeschylus, the great body of his work behind him, left Athens for the last time...
607	00:40:26	00:40:33	where he traveled to Sicily, seeking solitude in the wilderness in which to contemplate the meaning of his life.
608	00:41:03	00:41:18	Though he had fought and survived the endless bloody wars against the Persian kings, Darius and Xerxes, it was here, in silent meditation, that a beautiful act of a most violent nature brought him to Elysium...
609	00:41:20	00:41:22	...and eternal paradise.
610	00:41:22	00:41:24	Are you really gonna put that in your report?
611	00:41:24	00:41:29	Birds of prey drop shelled animals onto boulders to get at the meat.
612	00:41:29	00:41:33	Now, from the air, Holy Steven's head must have looked like just another rock.
613	00:41:35	00:41:37	You can Google it if you don't believe me.
614	00:41:37	00:41:39	The DNA on the shell was a match.
615	00:41:39	00:41:45	What are the odds, right? Before it happened, I would have said slim, but since it did happen, a hundred percent.
616	00:41:45	00:41:49	Seems like a lot of things keep falling out of the sky, right?
617	00:41:49	00:41:51	Poison, people, turtles.
618	00:41:51	00:41:52	Tortoises.
619	00:41:52	00:41:53	Whatever.
620	00:41:55	00:41:58	Or at least carrying an umbrella.
