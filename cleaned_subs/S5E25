0	00:00:12	00:00:14	Lab's only got one case tonight.
1	00:00:14	00:00:16	Why'd you bag that? I didn't.
2	00:00:16	00:00:17	That's not Nick's evidence.
3	00:00:17	00:00:19	Maybe it's a message.
4	00:00:19	00:00:21	Nick could be anywhere from Green Valley to Seven Hills to Arizona.
5	00:00:21	00:00:23	Guy comes in here with a package with no return address.
6	00:00:24	00:00:25	It's about Nick.
7	00:00:25	00:00:26	Hi, CSI guy.
8	00:00:26	00:00:28	You wondering why you're here?
9	00:00:28	00:00:30	Because you followed the evidence.
10	00:00:33	00:00:34	I don't think he knows we can see him.
11	00:00:34	00:00:39	If they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours, it must mean that he's going to have additional air supply.
12	00:00:39	00:00:42	The feed stays active for two minutes every time you press the Watch button.
13	00:00:42	00:00:43	I say we keep the light on.
14	00:00:43	00:00:45	I got called out to a pickup on Viking Circle.
15	00:00:45	00:00:48	I just found an abandoned package with some cash taped to it.
16	00:00:48	00:00:49	Yeah, the address was a waste of time.
17	00:00:49	00:00:52	The guy probably picked the house at random 'cause he knew we'd chase it.
18	00:00:52	00:00:53	Has Nick's family been informed?
19	00:00:53	00:00:54	That would be my job.
20	00:00:54	00:00:56	We're not sure who has your son.
21	00:00:56	00:00:58	What the hell do you know?
22	00:00:58	00:00:59	Aw, Poncho.
23	00:00:59	00:01:01	What the hell you got yourself into?
24	00:01:01	00:01:04	The City of Las Vegas is not going to finance a ransom.
25	00:01:04	00:01:06	I need a million dollars and I need it now.
26	00:01:06	00:01:11	If you're coming to me like a cop with a tin cup in your hand, the answer is no.
27	00:01:11	00:01:15	If the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab.
28	00:01:15	00:01:16	You got a better plan, I'm all ears!
29	00:01:16	00:01:18	What does Nick Stokes mean to you?
30	00:01:18	00:01:21	Does your soul die every time you push that button?
31	00:01:21	00:01:23	Welcome to my world.
32	00:01:42	00:01:43	Pupils are even.
33	00:01:43	00:01:45	He blew himself up and left us with nothing.
34	00:01:45	00:01:48	Sir, are you experiencing any ringing in your ears?
35	00:01:49	00:01:50	We got the kidnapper's truck.
36	00:01:50	00:01:52	374-Robert-Charlie-David.
37	00:01:52	00:01:54	Run the plate.
38	00:01:54	00:01:55	That's the wrong box, Greg.
39	00:01:56	00:01:57	Well, pick one. There's three.
40	00:01:57	00:01:59	That one right there.
41	00:01:59	00:02:00	Give me a break.
42	00:02:00	00:02:01	I haven't done this before.
43	00:02:01	00:02:03	All right, let's go over it again.
44	00:02:03	00:02:08	The diagnostic unit gets attached to that black box, which gives us the mileage of his last trip.
45	00:02:08	00:02:09	Like an airplane.
46	00:02:09	00:02:11	That gives us the radius for the search area.
47	00:02:11	00:02:13	Right. Got it.
48	00:02:13	00:02:15	23 miles...
49	00:02:15	00:02:18	and we know he was heading east on the 215.
50	00:02:18	00:02:20	I'll get a map.
51	00:02:26	00:02:28	Somebody bag this money, please?
52	00:02:28	00:02:30	Don't get any funny ideas, either.
53	00:02:33	00:02:35	What I had to do to get this money and for what.
54	00:02:36	00:02:39	There's no I.D. on him.
55	00:03:03	00:03:06	I got a thumb.
56	00:03:41	00:03:43	How's he doing?
57	00:03:45	00:03:46	Hard to say.
58	00:03:46	00:03:49	About the same, I guess.
59	00:03:49	00:03:51	I'm gonna get some coffee.
60	00:03:51	00:03:53	Yeah.
61	00:04:12	00:04:14	Enough with the...
62	00:04:14	00:04:16	Enough with the damn light!
63	00:04:47	00:04:48	No.
64	00:04:52	00:04:54	The fan's connected...
65	00:04:54	00:04:57	The fan's connected to the light.
66	00:06:22	00:06:24	No.
67	00:07:32	00:07:34	What are you doing, Nicky?
68	00:07:46	00:07:49	What are you doing, Nicky?
69	00:07:54	00:07:56	Don't do it, Nicky!
70	00:08:12	00:08:14	You son of a bitch!
71	00:08:34	00:08:35	Oh.
72	00:08:37	00:08:40	You're still alive.
73	00:09:05	00:09:08	The light and the fan must have been running off the same battery.
74	00:09:09	00:09:10	Well, at least Nicky's keeping it together.
75	00:09:10	00:09:12	That's good.
76	00:09:12	00:09:14	What about the Web cam trace?
77	00:09:14	00:09:16	Signal's running through an anonymizer.
78	00:09:16	00:09:18	Different ISP each time we click the button.
79	00:09:18	00:09:21	I think I've got a handle on the pattern. Getting closer.
80	00:09:27	00:09:29	Sara?
81	00:09:29	00:09:31	I got something off your thumb.
82	00:09:36	00:09:42	So when you struck out on prints, I ran DNA through CODIS, hoping maybe the guy was in the system off an open case or a prior felony.
83	00:09:42	00:09:44	I got no straight-up match, but...
84	00:09:44	00:09:47	But you got a moderate stringency match for a Kelly Gordon.
85	00:09:47	00:09:51	Yeah, seven alleles in common, and based on the age, I'd say it was his daughter.
86	00:09:51	00:09:53	Good work, Mia.
87	00:09:53	00:10:01	Kelly Gordon is currently in state prison serving year three of a five-year sentence for accessory to murder.
88	00:10:10	00:10:13	The address of her crime scene is 625 Viking Circle.
89	00:10:13	00:10:16	That's the same place where the messenger picked up the package.
90	00:10:16	00:10:18	It wasn't random.
91	00:10:29	00:10:31	Hey, baby, let's go.
92	00:10:40	00:10:41	Hi. How ya doin'?
93	00:10:47	00:10:50	Neither was the Styrofoam cup.
94	00:10:50	00:10:55	So at trial, you testified that you went with your boyfriend to visit a buddy of his.
95	00:10:55	00:11:00	And when you went in the house, your boyfriend blew the guy away.
96	00:11:00	00:11:01	He wasn't my boyfriend.
97	00:11:01	00:11:04	I knew the guy two weeks.
98	00:11:04	00:11:06	Why am I here?
99	00:11:06	00:11:11	A Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it was found in that house.
100	00:11:11	00:11:14	You claimed you dropped it running for your life.
101	00:11:20	00:11:28	My word against a cup, and the next five years, I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cell mate.
102	00:11:30	00:11:33	You're not reopening my case.
103	00:11:35	00:11:37	What do you want?
104	00:11:37	00:11:38	Your father took it pretty hard.
105	00:11:38	00:11:41	He was an aerospace engineer, right?
106	00:11:41	00:11:44	Good with explosives?
107	00:11:44	00:11:47	So, this is about my dad?
108	00:11:48	00:11:50	You know, we got your visitors log.
109	00:11:52	00:11:56	Your father stopped coming to see you six weeks into your sentence.
110	00:11:56	00:11:59	Seeing your daughter turned into some...
111	00:12:01	00:12:04	...hood rat's lesbian sex slave can be rather emotional.
112	00:12:06	00:12:08	Why did he come see you last week?
113	00:12:09	00:12:11	Did you know what he was planning to do?
114	00:12:11	00:12:13	I don't know.
115	00:12:13	00:12:14	What did he do?
116	00:12:14	00:12:16	He kidnapped a friend of mine.
117	00:12:16	00:12:18	A CSI.
118	00:12:18	00:12:20	And then he blew himself up.
119	00:12:20	00:12:22	Tried to take some cops with him.
120	00:12:29	00:12:31	How many did he get?
121	00:12:32	00:12:33	Hey, we're all still here.
122	00:12:33	00:12:34	Nick is still missing.
123	00:12:34	00:12:35	Who's Nick?
124	00:12:35	00:12:38	The CSI is still missing.
125	00:12:38	00:12:40	Do you know where he is?
126	00:12:42	00:12:45	That's pretty funny-- you guys not being able to find something.
127	00:12:45	00:12:50	Yeah, look, if you cooperate, we can get your sentence reduced.
128	00:12:53	00:12:55	You know what I used to do before this?
129	00:12:56	00:12:59	Back when I was alive?
130	00:12:59	00:13:02	I used to grow things.
131	00:13:02	00:13:04	Outside.
132	00:13:05	00:13:07	I was studying horticulture.
133	00:13:07	00:13:10	Flowers.
134	00:13:11	00:13:15	My cell mate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's day.
135	00:13:18	00:13:19	Want to smell it?
136	00:13:22	00:13:25	I hope your friend dies.
137	00:14:51	00:14:54	Hey, I found a trigger wire.
138	00:14:54	00:14:58	Maybe... once we reassemble all the components, we'll be able to tell where the bomb came from. Maybe...
139	00:14:58	00:15:00	Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.
140	00:15:00	00:15:04	Maybe if we count up all the damn maybes, maybe Nick will be alive!
141	00:15:04	00:15:07	You know what I'm saying?!
142	00:15:07	00:15:08	Was that necessary?
143	00:15:08	00:15:09	Never mind my clothes.
144	00:15:09	00:15:11	Look at the evidence.
145	00:15:11	00:15:12	Damn it.
146	00:15:14	00:15:17	Sorry, Greg. I'll go talk to him.
147	00:15:19	00:15:23	Hey, Warrick, hey.
148	00:15:23	00:15:25	Hey, how you holding up?
149	00:15:25	00:15:27	I'm not.
150	00:15:27	00:15:29	I know.
151	00:15:29	00:15:33	I just can't help but thinking that could have been me in that box, you know?
152	00:15:33	00:15:35	We flipped a coin for that trash run.
153	00:15:35	00:15:38	Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin.
154	00:15:38	00:15:41	If that was me, I would have...
155	00:15:41	00:15:42	Hey, you know what?
156	00:15:42	00:15:43	I know you.
157	00:15:44	00:15:45	I don't believe that.
158	00:15:45	00:15:47	Okay?
159	00:15:47	00:15:49	No. You're wrong.
160	00:15:49	00:15:52	I wouldn't have lasted this far.
161	00:15:52	00:15:56	Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece...
162	00:15:56	00:15:59	Hey, guys, come here.
163	00:15:59	00:16:01	I found something.
164	00:16:04	00:16:05	Look at this.
165	00:16:13	00:16:15	There's something underneath there.
166	00:16:23	00:16:24	Oh, it's got an edge right here.
167	00:16:24	00:16:26	All right.
168	00:16:26	00:16:27	Another one over here.
169	00:16:27	00:16:29	Greg, get some crowbars.
170	00:16:33	00:16:36	Do you think Nick could be under here?
171	00:16:36	00:16:37	I don't know, man.
172	00:16:37	00:16:40	It would have to be at least six feet long.
173	00:16:48	00:16:54	Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise-- and who's to say he didn't-- he could be.
174	00:17:25	00:17:26	Hey!
175	00:17:31	00:17:32	I'm in here!
176	00:17:34	00:17:35	Hey!
177	00:17:49	00:17:50	I hit something.
178	00:18:09	00:18:11	I'm here.
179	00:18:11	00:18:13	It's Plexiglas.
180	00:18:13	00:18:15	Nick! Nick?
181	00:18:15	00:18:17	Hey, I'm right here!
182	00:18:17	00:18:19	Nick, hold on there, buddy!
183	00:18:20	00:18:23	Nick?
184	00:18:30	00:18:31	It's a dog.
185	00:18:34	00:18:36	It's a dog.
186	00:18:53	00:18:55	Stop, stop...
187	00:18:58	00:18:59	Oh, my God.
188	00:20:41	00:20:44	My name is Nick Stokes.
189	00:20:44	00:20:50	If anyone... finds this tape, turn it in to the Las Vegas... PD.
190	00:20:51	00:20:53	There should be a reward.
191	00:21:03	00:21:08	Mom, Sisko...
192	00:21:10	00:21:14	...well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye, but it's all I got.
193	00:21:19	00:21:21	I love you.
194	00:21:21	00:21:25	You raised me right...
195	00:21:25	00:21:29	and I'm going to miss you.
196	00:21:33	00:21:39	As for the rest of you guys, I know you did the best you could to find me.
197	00:21:47	00:21:50	Grissom...
198	00:21:59	00:22:03	No, you never did, Nick.
199	00:22:18	00:22:20	He's going into convulsions.
200	00:22:20	00:22:22	He's losing it.
201	00:22:26	00:22:28	What's going on?
202	00:22:28	00:22:30	Wha...?
203	00:22:33	00:22:36	Wait a minute.
204	00:22:43	00:22:45	Ants.
205	00:22:47	00:22:49	My God, he's being eaten alive.
206	00:23:50	00:23:53	That's it, Nicky.
207	00:23:53	00:23:55	Stay still.
208	00:23:55	00:23:58	They won't bite.
209	00:23:58	00:24:00	As much.
210	00:24:00	00:24:02	This has got to be a prototype.
211	00:24:02	00:24:08	It was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.
212	00:24:18	00:24:20	Now, what are those?
213	00:24:20	00:24:22	I don't know.
214	00:24:27	00:24:40	All right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did, I figure Nick's got another 90 minutes left in there.
215	00:24:46	00:24:48	Oh, come on, pal.
216	00:24:48	00:24:49	Yeah.
217	00:24:49	00:24:52	That's it.
218	00:24:52	00:24:54	Come on.
219	00:24:58	00:25:01	Little more.
220	00:25:03	00:25:05	Keep coming.
221	00:25:07	00:25:10	Show me what you're made of.
222	00:25:10	00:25:13	Come on, buddy.
223	00:25:14	00:25:15	Gotcha.
224	00:25:41	00:25:44	Solenopsis invicta.
225	00:25:44	00:25:46	They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada.
226	00:25:46	00:25:47	They don't like our soil.
227	00:25:47	00:25:51	The only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.
228	00:25:51	00:25:53	There's 11 nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.
229	00:25:53	00:25:57	Okay, I've got the Web cam trace down to here.
230	00:25:57	00:26:03	And the data from the black box in Walter Gordon's truck gave us a 23-mile travel radius.
231	00:26:03	00:26:07	Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area.
232	00:26:07	00:26:10	Here and here.
233	00:26:10	00:26:11	Wait, wait. wait, wait.
234	00:26:11	00:26:15	Kelly Gordon, the daughter, worked with plants.
235	00:26:15	00:26:17	Hold on. Hold on.
236	00:26:37	00:26:40	You guys, Nick is here.
237	00:27:37	00:27:40	You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound.
238	00:27:40	00:27:41	Where is it?
239	00:27:41	00:27:44	People usually prefer to stay away from it.
240	00:27:52	00:27:54	All right, look. Fan out.
241	00:27:54	00:27:55	Look for loose soil.
242	00:27:55	00:27:57	Anything that might've been dug up recently.
243	00:27:57	00:27:59	That's the whole place.
244	00:28:26	00:28:27	Hey!
245	00:28:27	00:28:31	I'm picking up the Web cam transmitter.
246	00:28:31	00:28:34	She's got something! Move! Move!
247	00:29:14	00:29:17	This is it! I found it!
248	00:29:17	00:29:19	It's here.
249	00:29:19	00:29:22	I found it! This is it!
250	00:29:24	00:29:26	Nick!
251	00:29:26	00:29:28	Nick, we're here. Hang on!
252	00:29:28	00:29:31	Nicky!
253	00:29:52	00:29:54	It's a damn shame they didn't get to him sooner.
254	00:29:55	00:29:57	I sure will miss him.
255	00:29:57	00:30:03	You know, David, I've seen fire ant bites in my time, but never anything like this.
256	00:30:03	00:30:08	Do you think he suffered?
257	00:30:08	00:30:11	Do I think he suffered?
258	00:30:11	00:30:13	Yes. Definitely.
259	00:30:17	00:30:20	All right. ( clears throat ) On three.
260	00:30:20	00:30:21	Uno...
261	00:30:21	00:30:22	Dos...
262	00:30:22	00:30:24	Tres! Tres!
263	00:30:27	00:30:31	All right. Would you care to do the Y incision?
264	00:30:31	00:30:35	Well, Y not?
265	00:30:44	00:30:46	Mind your hands and feet.
266	00:31:00	00:31:02	Yes...
267	00:31:09	00:31:12	He won't be needing this anymore.
268	00:31:14	00:31:15	Nice.
269	00:31:15	00:31:17	A lung.
270	00:31:17	00:31:18	So, Doc.
271	00:31:18	00:31:20	How did my son die?
272	00:31:20	00:31:22	Anaphylactic shock?
273	00:31:22	00:31:24	No, no, he didn't live long enough for that.
274	00:31:24	00:31:27	COD was asphyxiation. Oh.
275	00:31:27	00:31:33	When the blood oxygen drops to less than 16% and the CO2 builds up, there's a rapid loss of consciousness.
276	00:31:33	00:31:35	Death within minutes.
277	00:31:35	00:31:37	With no disfiguring physical findings.
278	00:31:37	00:31:40	He'll look great at the funeral. Oh, yes.
279	00:31:40	00:31:43	His mother will appreciate that. Good.
280	00:31:48	00:31:51	Your son had a good heart.
281	00:32:52	00:32:54	I hit something.
282	00:32:55	00:32:56	We got you, Nicky.
283	00:33:18	00:33:20	Hey!
284	00:33:20	00:33:21	Hey!
285	00:33:21	00:33:23	We got you, man.
286	00:33:23	00:33:24	Hey, Nicky!
287	00:33:24	00:33:26	Nicky! Yeah. Hey, hold on there.
288	00:33:26	00:33:28	Hey, put that down.
289	00:33:28	00:33:29	Put that down.
290	00:33:29	00:33:30	Put that down. We got you.
291	00:33:30	00:33:32	We're gonna get you out of here.
292	00:33:32	00:33:33	Hang in there.
293	00:33:35	00:33:36	Oh, my God.
294	00:33:37	00:33:38	We need that fire extinguisher!
295	00:33:39	00:33:40	Give me that fire extinguisher.
296	00:33:41	00:33:42	These ants are getting at him, man.
297	00:33:53	00:33:54	Oh.
298	00:33:54	00:33:55	Short bursts, Greg.
299	00:33:55	00:33:57	Don't suffocate him!
300	00:34:03	00:34:06	Hang on, buddy.
301	00:34:06	00:34:08	Hang on. Almost out of there.
302	00:34:08	00:34:10	Get the paramedics!
303	00:34:11	00:34:13	Hang on. Hang on.
304	00:34:13	00:34:15	We're gonna kill those ants.
305	00:34:15	00:34:16	Okay? ( mumbles indistinctly )
306	00:34:18	00:34:20	Yeah. ( phone rings )
307	00:34:20	00:34:22	Willows.
308	00:34:22	00:34:24	Yeah. Hey, boss... We found him.
309	00:34:24	00:34:25	We're getting him out now.
310	00:34:25	00:34:26	That's great. Wai-Wait.
311	00:34:26	00:34:28	Don't-Don't hang up. Just-just listen.
312	00:34:28	00:34:29	What? What?
313	00:34:29	00:34:34	Those dimples on the bottom of the prototype; GCMS found traces of SEMTEX on each one.
314	00:34:34	00:34:35	You got to be kidding me.
315	00:34:35	00:34:37	One, two, three.
316	00:34:37	00:34:39	Everyone out of the hole.
317	00:34:39	00:34:41	That box is ready to explode!
318	00:34:41	00:34:42	Are you kidding?
319	00:34:42	00:34:43	Get out of there now!
320	00:34:44	00:34:45	I'm not leaving without Nick.
321	00:34:45	00:34:47	There are charges under the box!
322	00:34:48	00:34:50	I'm not leaving here without him.
323	00:34:50	00:34:52	Warrick, Catherine's right.
324	00:34:52	00:34:53	Get out of the hole now.
325	00:34:53	00:34:55	I know what we're gonna do.
326	00:34:55	00:34:56	Just trust me.
327	00:35:01	00:35:02	Help!
328	00:35:02	00:35:06	We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.
329	00:35:13	00:35:14	Nick!
330	00:35:14	00:35:16	Can you hear me?
331	00:35:16	00:35:21	It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay?
332	00:35:21	00:35:23	Nick!
333	00:35:24	00:35:26	Poncho!
334	00:35:26	00:35:28	Listen to me.
335	00:35:30	00:35:32	Put your hand on my hand.
336	00:35:35	00:35:37	Good.
337	00:35:37	00:35:39	Now listen.
338	00:35:39	00:35:42	There may be explosives under the box.
339	00:35:42	00:35:46	They're probably set on pressure switches.
340	00:35:51	00:35:56	We need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?
341	00:35:56	00:36:01	Poncho, nod your head if you understand me.
342	00:36:05	00:36:09	Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight.
343	00:36:09	00:36:12	I need a rope and a caribiner.
344	00:36:12	00:36:13	You got it.
345	00:36:13	00:36:19	All right, Poncho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down.
346	00:36:19	00:36:21	Okay?
347	00:36:21	00:36:22	Or else you'll blow us all up.
348	00:36:23	00:36:24	Do you understand that?
349	00:36:24	00:36:26	Yeah, yeah.
350	00:36:26	00:36:28	Do you promise?
351	00:36:31	00:36:34	Poncho, say, I promise.
352	00:36:34	00:36:35	I promise.
353	00:36:35	00:36:37	Bring it over.
354	00:36:37	00:36:39	This way.
355	00:36:39	00:36:40	Don't move.
356	00:36:47	00:36:54	I got you, I got you, I got you... I got you...
357	00:36:54	00:36:56	Stay still.
358	00:36:56	00:36:59	Stay still.
359	00:36:59	00:37:02	Okay, okay, okay.
360	00:37:02	00:37:05	All right, bring that over.
361	00:37:16	00:37:22	Okay, Poncho, I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.
362	00:37:22	00:37:24	Now!
363	00:37:26	00:37:28	Ready?
364	00:37:28	00:37:28	Go!
365	00:38:36	00:38:38	I want my guys back.
366	00:39:29	00:39:31	You the one?
367	00:39:31	00:39:33	Yeah.
368	00:39:35	00:39:37	Yeah, back at you.
369	00:39:38	00:39:40	What do you want me to say?
370	00:39:40	00:39:42	I'm sorry?
371	00:39:42	00:39:45	No, you didn't do anything to me.
372	00:39:46	00:39:49	And what your dad did, I...
373	00:39:49	00:39:51	I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.
374	00:39:51	00:39:52	Hey, Kelly.
375	00:39:53	00:39:55	Kelly.
376	00:39:57	00:39:59	Pick it up.
377	00:40:06	00:40:08	In a few years...
378	00:40:09	00:40:11	when you get out of here...
379	00:40:13	00:40:15	don't take it with you.
380	00:40:21	00:40:23	That's it?
381	00:40:23	00:40:25	Yeah.
382	00:40:25	00:40:27	Yeah, that's it.
383	00:40:27	00:40:30	We're done.
