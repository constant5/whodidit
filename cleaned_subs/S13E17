0,00:00:45,00:00:48,Why must I go through this awful ritual?
1,00:00:48,00:00:50,"Don't be so dramatic, David."
2,00:00:50,00:00:52,It's just a high school reunion.
3,00:00:52,00:00:57,The only reason I bought these stupid tickets was to show off my beautiful wife.
4,00:00:57,00:01:03,"Who's oh-so flattered, but too pregnant to stand and too cheap to let you waste both $100 tickets."
5,00:01:03,00:01:06,Sagebrush High class of '98.
6,00:01:06,00:01:10,It-it made Lord of the Flies look like Fantasy Island.
7,00:01:10,00:01:16,And the only way I survived those four awful years was by being utterly invisible.
8,00:01:16,00:01:19,And now I'm supposed to go back without being forced at gunpoint?
9,00:01:19,00:01:22,I bet there'll be cupcakes.
10,00:01:22,00:01:24,What if you go into labor and I'm not here?
11,00:01:24,00:01:27,"It's not going to happen, but I'll call your cell."
12,00:01:27,00:01:29,The reunion will be good for you.
13,00:01:29,00:01:32,Everyone will see the amazing guy you've become.
14,00:01:32,00:01:34,"And you'll see how everyone's grown up, evolved."
15,00:01:36,00:01:38,I love you.
16,00:01:38,00:01:39,Go.
17,00:01:42,00:01:43,You're gonna have fun!
18,00:01:47,00:01:49,"(men chattering, laughing)"
19,00:01:49,00:01:50,"Come on, man!"
20,00:01:50,00:01:51,Don't fight it!
21,00:01:51,00:01:52,(grunts) Hey!
22,00:01:52,00:01:54,(laughs)
23,00:01:54,00:02:03,"""Fun."" Hey."
24,00:02:03,00:02:06,Hey.
25,00:02:06,00:02:08,"H-Hi, Becca."
26,00:02:10,00:02:12,Name?
27,00:02:12,00:02:14,David Phillips.
28,00:02:14,00:02:15,I don't have a Phillip Davis.
29,00:02:15,00:02:17,"No, David Phill..."
30,00:02:17,00:02:18,It's fine.
31,00:02:18,00:02:19,Here.
32,00:02:21,00:02:22,(table thumps)
33,00:02:22,00:02:24,Sorry.
34,00:02:54,00:02:56,Hey. Come on.
35,00:03:05,00:03:11,MAN: And the fourth most exciting thing about working in insurance-related actuarial science is the way you see the world differently.
36,00:03:11,00:03:15,This place is a den of liability.
37,00:03:15,00:03:19,Rising exponentially with each drink that's consumed.
38,00:03:19,00:03:24,Half of these people aren't even chewing their hors d'oeuvres to a safe consistency.
39,00:03:24,00:03:28,Not to mention the bacterial populations in the lavatories.
40,00:03:28,00:03:31,"I mean, you can get any number of STDs..."
41,00:03:31,00:03:32,Excuse me. Oh.
42,00:03:32,00:03:35,"Well, be careful, they're running rampant in there."
43,00:03:35,00:03:36,Running rampant in there.
44,00:03:36,00:03:37,"Hey, guys, cake."
45,00:04:15,00:04:17,Becca.
46,00:04:20,00:04:22,Hey. Hey.
47,00:04:22,00:04:23,You all right?
48,00:04:23,00:04:24,"Yeah, no, I'm fine."
49,00:04:24,00:04:26,I-I've seen dead bodies before.
50,00:04:26,00:04:27,"But, uh..."
51,00:04:27,00:04:29,"It's not the same, huh?"
52,00:04:29,00:04:31,I spoke to her an hour ago.
53,00:04:31,00:04:33,"Well, Doc's gonna be here in a couple of minutes."
54,00:04:33,00:04:37,You able to keep everybody away from the immediate scene till the policemen came?
55,00:04:37,00:04:42,"I did the best I could, but former hall monitor doesn't exactly demand respect around here."
56,00:04:42,00:04:45,Did you know the victim really well?
57,00:04:45,00:04:46,From afar.
58,00:04:46,00:04:49,Becca Sabin was queen of the class.
59,00:04:49,00:04:52,"A head cheerleader, social secretary."
60,00:04:52,00:04:54,She planned all this.
61,00:05:00,00:05:02,"Well, most of it."
62,00:05:07,00:05:13,"So, queen of the class 15 years after her reign."
63,00:05:13,00:05:16,Question is: which one of her subjects did this?
64,00:05:55,00:05:57,ROBBINS: Irregular laceration.
65,00:05:57,00:06:02,"Judging by the amount of blood, appears to have severed an artery and bled out into the bubble tray."
66,00:06:02,00:06:06,The assailant might've grabbed one of these...
67,00:06:06,00:06:08,hand-me-down weapons.
68,00:06:08,00:06:12,There's a whole confiscated armory here.
69,00:06:12,00:06:15,GREG: I never understood the kids who'd bring this stuff to school.
70,00:06:15,00:06:20,"I mean, showing off your pair of nunchucks is worth expulsion? Yeah, right?"
71,00:06:20,00:06:22,"Well, that's addled essence of adolescence."
72,00:06:22,00:06:26,Brain's prefrontal cortex doesn't fully develop until your 20s.
73,00:06:26,00:06:31,Means your teen years are spent oblivious to consequences and prone to reckless behavior.
74,00:06:31,00:06:34,Our killer's about 15 years too late for that excuse.
75,00:06:34,00:06:39,"Well, you think a decade and a half would let everyone grow into mature and caring adults."
76,00:06:39,00:06:40,Not always the case.
77,00:06:40,00:06:44,"GREG: Well, no visible blood on any of the sharp implements."
78,00:06:44,00:06:46,I'll bring them back to the lab anyways.
79,00:06:55,00:06:57,Got a bloody handprint in the bubble tray.
80,00:06:57,00:06:59,No ridge detail.
81,00:06:59,00:07:02,Killer may have wiped their hands in the soap.
82,00:07:02,00:07:05,Trace from the killer could've been carried out in the bubbles.
83,00:07:05,00:07:11,Which means it could've landed anywhere on anyone at the party.
84,00:07:11,00:07:15,"Hundreds of popped, red bubbles out there; we have to check them all."
85,00:07:15,00:07:17,Why don't you start with a smaller task.
86,00:07:17,00:07:20,Found this in her palm.
87,00:07:20,00:07:22,STOKES: Looks like glass.
88,00:07:22,00:07:25,Becca was my best friend in school.
89,00:07:25,00:07:27,Kind of ruled the place.
90,00:07:27,00:07:28,Kate and Pippa.
91,00:07:28,00:07:30,Were you still close?
92,00:07:30,00:07:31,We drifted.
93,00:07:31,00:07:35,"Career, loving family, busy social life."
94,00:07:35,00:07:39,"I'm sure Becca had things going on, too."
95,00:07:39,00:07:41,So looking forward to catching up.
96,00:07:41,00:07:44,I bet.
97,00:07:44,00:07:47,"Kelly, I'm afraid I'm going to have to take your dress."
98,00:07:47,00:07:49,You can change into a gym uniform.
99,00:07:49,00:07:51,This stain's from one of the ill-advised bubbles.
100,00:07:51,00:07:54,Just red dye.
101,00:07:54,00:07:55,Isn't it?
102,00:07:59,00:08:04,"Well, it's nice to see a couple of gorgeous ladies printing and swabbing."
103,00:08:04,00:08:06,And casually trampling our search and seizure rights.
104,00:08:06,00:08:08,Kidding.
105,00:08:08,00:08:10,"The CSUs I work with, they could take a few pointers."
106,00:08:10,00:08:12,Are you law enforcement? Attorney.
107,00:08:12,00:08:14,Partner at Hoyt and Mendelsohn.
108,00:08:14,00:08:15,Manhattan.
109,00:08:15,00:08:18,"I was supposed to take a red-eye back tonight, prep for a big depo."
110,00:08:18,00:08:21,But what's a reunion without the valedictorian?
111,00:08:21,00:08:24,"Yes, Becca and I, we were on different tracks in high school."
112,00:08:24,00:08:26,Never really got to know each other.
113,00:08:26,00:08:29,"I was Harvard-bound, she was...enjoying herself."
114,00:08:31,00:08:32,And there he is.
115,00:08:32,00:08:33,"Hey, Janet."
116,00:08:33,00:08:36,"You know, Davey was a brain back then."
117,00:08:36,00:08:39,"If he applied himself, he could've been a doctor."
118,00:08:39,00:08:40,"Instead of, um..."
119,00:08:40,00:08:43,I'm the assistant medical examiner.
120,00:08:43,00:08:44,Glorified Igor.
121,00:08:45,00:08:47,"Kidding, Davey."
122,00:08:47,00:08:49,"Nice seeing you, Janet."
123,00:08:49,00:08:50,"MAN: Hey, Igor!"
124,00:08:50,00:08:52,(laughter)
125,00:08:52,00:08:54,MAN: Becca was amazing.
126,00:08:54,00:08:56,We met and we married last year.
127,00:08:56,00:08:58,"That's a tough one, losing your wife."
128,00:08:58,00:09:00,"I'm sorry, Mr. Foster."
129,00:09:00,00:09:03,Were you and Becca together the whole evening?
130,00:09:03,00:09:05,"No, I couldn't keep up with her."
131,00:09:05,00:09:07,Between the hosting and the mingling.
132,00:09:07,00:09:09,I just parked myself at this table with a scotch.
133,00:09:09,00:09:12,Did you notice any tension between Becca and her classmates?
134,00:09:12,00:09:13,No.
135,00:09:13,00:09:16,"As far as I know, Becca had lost touch with everybody here."
136,00:09:16,00:09:20,Tonight was supposed to be about her...
137,00:09:20,00:09:21,reconnecting.
138,00:09:21,00:09:24,(sighs)
139,00:09:24,00:09:25,Thanks.
140,00:09:25,00:09:26,"Watch the blood, boys."
141,00:09:26,00:09:29,(phone ringing)
142,00:09:31,00:09:32,Stokes.
143,00:09:32,00:09:33,"SANDERS: Hey, it's Greg."
144,00:09:33,00:09:36,I just finished with all the blades I brought back to the lab.
145,00:09:36,00:09:37,No blood on any of them.
146,00:09:37,00:09:39,That's a bummer.
147,00:09:39,00:09:43,"Hey, you know that green sliver we pulled from the victim's palm?"
148,00:09:43,00:09:46,"Yeah, it's glass, but Hodges couldn't identify the source."
149,00:09:46,00:09:48,Think I just did.
150,00:09:48,00:09:49,Let me call you back.
151,00:09:58,00:09:59,(beep)
152,00:09:59,00:10:02,(copier whirring)
153,00:10:11,00:10:12,(grunting)
154,00:10:12,00:10:14,(copier whirring)
155,00:10:21,00:10:24,PHILLIPS: Decedent's heart is grayish in color.
156,00:10:24,00:10:26,It's consistent with exsanguination.
157,00:10:26,00:10:28,Otherwise healthy.
158,00:10:32,00:10:35,Stomach contents.
159,00:10:35,00:10:37,Smell of alcohol.
160,00:10:37,00:10:41,Presence of a partially-digested bready substance.
161,00:10:41,00:10:44,It's a crab puff.
162,00:10:46,00:10:52,"Didn't you eat, like, seven of them while you were lurking around in the corners?"
163,00:10:52,00:10:55,I can't believe you get to see me naked.
164,00:10:55,00:11:01,"Phillip Davis, rando weirdo who probably had a massive crush on me."
165,00:11:01,00:11:02,This is my job.
166,00:11:02,00:11:05,I am the assistant medical examiner.
167,00:11:05,00:11:08,They throw you that title instead of your 50 cent raise?
168,00:11:08,00:11:11,"If you're so smart, how come you're not a doctor?"
169,00:11:11,00:11:12,"Well, I was planning on being one..."
170,00:11:12,00:11:14,Phil.
171,00:11:14,00:11:15,Concentrate.
172,00:11:15,00:11:17,Don't mutilate.
173,00:11:17,00:11:18,It's David.
174,00:11:18,00:11:22,"And I didn't have a crush on you, I had a crush on Lizzie Burns, so..."
175,00:11:22,00:11:23,"Concentrate, Phil."
176,00:11:23,00:11:24,(door opens)
177,00:11:24,00:11:25,David.
178,00:11:25,00:11:27,ROBBINS: David?
179,00:11:27,00:11:28,Everything okay?
180,00:11:28,00:11:31,"Yeah. Uh, fine."
181,00:11:31,00:11:32,"Uh, fine, Doc."
182,00:11:32,00:11:33,"Um, stomach lining..."
183,00:11:33,00:11:37,"uh, the stomach lining exhibits a crater-shaped sore."
184,00:11:37,00:11:39,It's approximately 12 millimeters.
185,00:11:39,00:11:42,It looks like a peptic ulcer.
186,00:11:42,00:11:47,One centimeter diameter erosion of the lower esophageal sphincter.
187,00:11:47,00:11:49,Could be acid reflux.
188,00:11:49,00:11:51,Exacerbated by stress.
189,00:11:51,00:11:52,Or alcohol consumption.
190,00:11:52,00:11:54,One vodka tonic.
191,00:11:54,00:11:56,Moving on to the throat.
192,00:11:56,00:11:57,"The, uh..."
193,00:11:57,00:11:59,epiglottis is inflamed.
194,00:11:59,00:12:03,Likely result of the trauma from the laceration.
195,00:12:03,00:12:07,Majority of the sharp-force trauma is centered in the trachea.
196,00:12:07,00:12:11,"An irregular cut through the adjacent tissue, transecting the carotid artery."
197,00:12:11,00:12:16,Also noting an incidental injury to the victim's lip.
198,00:12:16,00:12:19,"Possible cold sore, often associated with... Don't even."
199,00:12:19,00:12:21,...herpes outbreak.
200,00:12:21,00:12:22,BECCA: Charming.
201,00:12:22,00:12:25,No wonder you didn't start dating until you were 26.
202,00:12:25,00:12:27,"25, technically."
203,00:12:27,00:12:28,Pardon?
204,00:12:28,00:12:30,"Uh, nothing, uh..."
205,00:12:30,00:12:35,Likely C.O.D is exsanguination caused by the transection of the carotid artery.
206,00:12:35,00:12:39,"Gee, you think the giant gorge ripped through my throat might have done it?"
207,00:12:39,00:12:43,Paging Dr. Einstein.
208,00:12:43,00:12:44,I'm gonna get some air.
209,00:13:19,00:13:23,"RUSSELL: Copier has a pretty good memory, doesn't it?"
210,00:13:23,00:13:26,"Maybe you do, too, Kelly."
211,00:13:26,00:13:27,Is that why you attacked Becca?
212,00:13:27,00:13:29,Some old grudge stirred up?
213,00:13:29,00:13:31,I didn't kill her.
214,00:13:31,00:13:35,"That fight at the copier? If I didn't stop her, she would've terrorized the reunion."
215,00:13:35,00:13:36,Wow.
216,00:13:36,00:13:38,What does that mean?
217,00:13:38,00:13:40,She was up to her old tricks.
218,00:13:40,00:13:43,"""Games Bitches Play."" Um, I'm sorry?"
219,00:13:45,00:13:47,She made these.
220,00:13:50,00:13:52,"""Reunion Bingo."
221,00:13:52,00:13:59,"""As you booze and schmooze your way ""through the evening, fill in the names ""of your classmates who have ""the following quirks."
222,00:13:59,00:14:00,"""Bulimic."
223,00:14:00,00:14:03,"""Screwing the babysitter."
224,00:14:03,00:14:07,"Snorted Daddy's fortune."" Five in a row gets a prize."
225,00:14:07,00:14:09,Becca started handing the cards out.
226,00:14:09,00:14:11,I grabbed them from everyone.
227,00:14:11,00:14:14,She went to the storeroom to copy more.
228,00:14:14,00:14:16,I followed her. I stopped her.
229,00:14:16,00:14:17,I can't believe you're doing this.
230,00:14:17,00:14:18,No! No!
231,00:14:18,00:14:20,Don't touch it! Give it!
232,00:14:20,00:14:23,(copier whirring)
233,00:14:23,00:14:25,"Ah, you bitch."
234,00:14:25,00:14:27,She was fine. Went back to the party.
235,00:14:27,00:14:31,"You know, a stupid little game may ruffle some feathers, but it hardly warrants an assault."
236,00:14:31,00:14:33,Or worse.
237,00:14:33,00:14:35,This wasn't some innocent prank.
238,00:14:35,00:14:36,Becca's husband...
239,00:14:36,00:14:39,"Grady Foster. Yes, we spoke to him."
240,00:14:39,00:14:40,He's a therapist.
241,00:14:40,00:14:41,Mm-hmm.
242,00:14:41,00:14:44,He's my therapist.
243,00:14:44,00:14:51,"I had no idea I was pouring my secrets out to the husband of the gossip queen, until I saw the two of them walk into the party together."
244,00:14:53,00:14:54,I'm on that card.
245,00:14:57,00:14:58,Klepto.
246,00:15:03,00:15:04,Working on it.
247,00:15:04,00:15:06,Good.
248,00:15:06,00:15:08,I didn't kill Becca.
249,00:15:08,00:15:12,But I bet anything there are other alums who are patients of Grady.
250,00:15:12,00:15:15,RUSSELL: Whose secrets ended up on Becca's bingo card.
251,00:15:15,00:15:18,Would give any of them a reason to stick a knife in her throat.
252,00:15:26,00:15:27,"So, I just spoke with Grady Foster."
253,00:15:27,00:15:31,He refused to divulge any of the names of his patients.
254,00:15:31,00:15:32,Confidentiality.
255,00:15:32,00:15:36,And he insisted that his wife knew nothing about what happened in those sessions.
256,00:15:36,00:15:39,"So Becca, what, just guessed at all these secrets?"
257,00:15:39,00:15:40,Maybe.
258,00:15:40,00:15:43,"Okay. So, the one patient we do know... Klepto Kelly."
259,00:15:43,00:15:46,Right. Has an alibi.
260,00:15:46,00:15:55,The photos from the partygoers' cameras put her at the far side of the room for the 15 minutes before the bloody bubbles actually start to appear.
261,00:15:55,00:16:01,"So, she may be guilty of a few misdemeanors, but she certainly didn't kill anybody."
262,00:16:01,00:16:04,Anybody on this card with a secret had motive.
263,00:16:04,00:16:08,"Even if Becca was guessing, the people with the secrets did not know that."
264,00:16:08,00:16:11,"But if Grady won't help us, there's no way for us to determine who those people are."
265,00:16:11,00:16:14,Hmm. Did David say anything about the card?
266,00:16:14,00:16:20,"He said he didn't want to ""disparage anybody by guessing."" His words."
267,00:16:20,00:16:21,A true gentleman. Mm.
268,00:16:21,00:16:22,(cell phone ringing)
269,00:16:22,00:16:24,He's really hoping he can help solve this one.
270,00:16:24,00:16:26,"Well, if it helps us catch a killer, I'm all for it."
271,00:16:26,00:16:27,Nick needs me. Bye.
272,00:16:27,00:16:31,"Uh, figured out a way to determine which alumni are patients of Becca's husband."
273,00:16:31,00:16:33,"Which makes them all suspects, right?"
274,00:16:33,00:16:35,Theory to beat.
275,00:16:35,00:16:40,STOKES: Surveillance footage from a gas station next to Grady's therapy office.
276,00:16:40,00:16:42,Catches the whole parking lot.
277,00:16:42,00:16:43,Very smart.
278,00:16:43,00:16:49,"STOKES: Catalog the license plates of all the cars entering the lot, run them through DMV against the alumni's cars."
279,00:16:49,00:16:51,"(chuckles) Nice one, bud."
280,00:16:51,00:16:53,"STOKES: Yeah, I thought you might like that."
281,00:16:53,00:16:55,"So, what was your high school experience like?"
282,00:16:55,00:17:01,"I was usually, uh, in the back of the van, sandwiched between a guitar case and a hitchhiker."
283,00:17:01,00:17:02,"Oh, that's right."
284,00:17:02,00:17:06,"I'm sorry, I forgot the, uh, traveling family caravan."
285,00:17:06,00:17:08,Wasn't that bad.
286,00:17:08,00:17:09,Depending on the hitchhiker.
287,00:17:12,00:17:13,Little late for a visit.
288,00:17:13,00:17:15,"Now, who's that?"
289,00:17:15,00:17:16,Zoom in.
290,00:17:19,00:17:22,"That's our victim, Becca Sabin, two nights ago."
291,00:17:24,00:17:25,Digging up dirt.
292,00:17:29,00:17:31,"Wait a minute, now, who's that?"
293,00:17:33,00:17:35,That's Grady Foster.
294,00:17:35,00:17:37,Her better half.
295,00:17:43,00:17:45,"BRASS: You lied to us, Mr. Foster."
296,00:17:45,00:17:50,You said that Becca never had access to your patients' secrets.
297,00:17:50,00:17:51,She did.
298,00:17:51,00:17:57,"And when she started spilling those secrets at the reunion, jeopardizing your whole practice, you shut her up."
299,00:17:57,00:18:00,Of course I was mad with her for snooping.
300,00:18:00,00:18:01,I figured she was just curious.
301,00:18:01,00:18:04,Secret lives of strangers.
302,00:18:04,00:18:08,I didn't realize she knew any of my patients until I saw those patients at the reunion.
303,00:18:08,00:18:09,"Well, that's convenient."
304,00:18:09,00:18:13,Additional suspects all mingling together makes it easier to commit the crime.
305,00:18:16,00:18:20,Do you not think I knew the kind of woman I married?
306,00:18:20,00:18:23,I had Becca pegged within five minutes of meeting her.
307,00:18:23,00:18:25,Narcissistic.
308,00:18:25,00:18:27,Manipulative.
309,00:18:27,00:18:30,With a near-pathological hunger for gossip.
310,00:18:30,00:18:32,And I loved her for all of it.
311,00:18:32,00:18:35,I never laid a hand on her.
312,00:18:35,00:18:41,"Now, unless you've got evidence of anything other than a... a marital spat..."
313,00:18:43,00:18:47,...I believe this session's time is up.
314,00:18:49,00:18:51,"(whirring, beeping)"
315,00:18:55,00:18:58,Is that the last of the 99 red balloons?
316,00:18:58,00:19:02,I've swabbed way more than 99 of these bastards.
317,00:19:02,00:19:07,There's a few on that post there behind you that I haven't gotten to yet.
318,00:19:07,00:19:12,Nick said that the therapist office surveillance didn't turn up any alums who were patients.
319,00:19:12,00:19:17,I thought we'd already spun the suspect bottle to Dr. Hubby himself.
320,00:19:17,00:19:18,No physical evidence against him.
321,00:19:21,00:19:23,Did you go to your high school reunion?
322,00:19:23,00:19:25,Ten-year was last year.
323,00:19:25,00:19:28,Didn't make the trip out.
324,00:19:28,00:19:30,You?
325,00:19:30,00:19:33,The one area of history I choose not to dwell in?
326,00:19:33,00:19:35,My high school years.
327,00:19:35,00:19:38,But you...
328,00:19:38,00:19:43,"beautiful blonde, sunny SoCal-- you must have loved it."
329,00:19:43,00:19:44,Yeah.
330,00:19:44,00:19:46,Could've been worse.
331,00:19:52,00:19:55,I've got some trace on this one.
332,00:19:55,00:19:57,(cell phone beeps)
333,00:19:57,00:19:58,Just got a text from Brass.
334,00:19:58,00:20:04,"Some kid tweeted LVPD, ""You idiots missed a dead body at Sagebrush High."
335,00:20:04,00:20:23,"50 yard line."" Well, he's breathing."
336,00:20:28,00:20:30,I think I found the culprit.
337,00:20:32,00:20:35,Sir.
338,00:20:35,00:20:37,(shouts) Come on!
339,00:20:37,00:20:39,(grunts)
340,00:20:39,00:20:40,Come on!
341,00:20:40,00:20:42,Gooch!
342,00:20:42,00:20:44,They're running the blitz.
343,00:20:44,00:20:45,"Block, damn it! Block!"
344,00:20:45,00:20:46,(growls): Yeah!
345,00:20:46,00:20:49,(groans)
346,00:20:49,00:20:50,We need a first down.
347,00:20:50,00:20:51,You need a time-out.
348,00:20:51,00:20:52,"Greg, we need backup."
349,00:21:06,00:21:07,Super Dave.
350,00:21:07,00:21:09,"Hey, Nick."
351,00:21:09,00:21:10,"Um, Russell said that I could check in."
352,00:21:10,00:21:13,Um... I heard about the new suspect.
353,00:21:13,00:21:15,"Yeah, Sean McHenry. You know him?"
354,00:21:15,00:21:17,"Yeah, I know Sean."
355,00:21:17,00:21:18,Big man on campus.
356,00:21:18,00:21:20,Quarterback.
357,00:21:20,00:21:22,He dated Becca Sabin all four years.
358,00:21:22,00:21:24,Really? Mm-hmm.
359,00:21:24,00:21:28,"Well, her bloody handprint ended up on his back last night."
360,00:21:28,00:21:29,Wow.
361,00:21:29,00:21:30,Well...
362,00:21:30,00:21:34,"for what it's worth, he was a colossal jerk in high school."
363,00:21:34,00:21:35,Really? Yeah.
364,00:21:35,00:21:36,Hmm.
365,00:21:36,00:21:37,Janet.
366,00:21:37,00:21:38,What are you doing here?
367,00:21:38,00:21:41,I'm representing my client.
368,00:21:41,00:21:43,"I'm sorry, why would you want to help him?"
369,00:21:43,00:21:44,"Easy, Dave."
370,00:21:44,00:21:46,"Take it easy, buddy."
371,00:21:46,00:21:48,"He called me, requested my counsel."
372,00:21:48,00:21:51,"If you've got some post-wedgie grudge against the guy, grow up."
373,00:21:51,00:21:53,"High school's over, David."
374,00:21:59,00:22:01,"What do you do for a living, Mr. McHenry?"
375,00:22:01,00:22:02,He's an educator.
376,00:22:02,00:22:03,What capacity?
377,00:22:03,00:22:05,A gym teacher.
378,00:22:05,00:22:06,Gym teacher.
379,00:22:06,00:22:09,Okay. What grade?
380,00:22:09,00:22:10,Junior high.
381,00:22:10,00:22:11,Junior high.
382,00:22:11,00:22:14,"Well, that's a tough age, isn't it? (chuckles)"
383,00:22:14,00:22:21,"Hey, speaking of, it must be hard to have your best days 15 years behind you, huh?"
384,00:22:21,00:22:23,(scoffs) How's that?
385,00:22:23,00:22:26,Wrangling dodge balls for little kids?
386,00:22:26,00:22:27,(chuckles)
387,00:22:27,00:22:31,"When all your classmates have passed you by, forgotten you."
388,00:22:31,00:22:34,"Well, like with Becca, she married a much more successful man."
389,00:22:34,00:22:36,(scoffs) Becca was still into me.
390,00:22:36,00:22:38,Sean... She was.
391,00:22:38,00:22:39,She was all over me.
392,00:22:39,00:22:41,At the reunion? Yeah.
393,00:22:41,00:22:44,She took me back into that storeroom.
394,00:22:44,00:22:45,We were making out like we were 16.
395,00:22:45,00:22:47,Or...
396,00:22:47,00:22:51,maybe you wanted it to be... like you were 16 again.
397,00:22:51,00:22:55,"Huh? You followed her back there, she shut you down, you grabbed the knife..."
398,00:22:55,00:22:57,No. What about the blood on your back?
399,00:22:57,00:22:59,She had a little cut on her palm.
400,00:22:59,00:23:00,That's probably how the blood got there.
401,00:23:02,00:23:05,She was into me. She was.
402,00:23:05,00:23:06,Come on.
403,00:23:06,00:23:08,"Sean, really?"
404,00:23:08,00:23:09,She was.
405,00:23:13,00:23:16,"For a minute, and then she backed off, said she had to get back to the party."
406,00:23:18,00:23:20,And you just let her go? Yeah.
407,00:23:20,00:23:22,I'd had enough of the reunion. Okay.
408,00:23:22,00:23:23,Then what?
409,00:23:25,00:23:28,Then I went to the closest liquor store.
410,00:23:28,00:23:32,Took the bottle out under the Friday night lights to drink alone.
411,00:23:34,00:23:35,'Cause you're right.
412,00:23:35,00:23:37,Those were the best days of my life.
413,00:23:40,00:23:41,Can this be over?
414,00:23:41,00:23:42,It can.
415,00:23:42,00:23:44,You're not holding my client?
416,00:23:44,00:23:47,"No. No, no."
417,00:23:47,00:23:49,"Don't go far, Sean."
418,00:23:49,00:23:51,(chuckles)
419,00:23:51,00:23:53,Never have.
420,00:23:53,00:23:58,Trace from your burst bubble is asbestos and acrylic tan paint.
421,00:23:58,00:23:59,Piece of popcorn ceiling.
422,00:23:59,00:24:06,Mm-hmm. As you no doubt remember witnessing at the temple to 1974 that is my mother's home.
423,00:24:06,00:24:11,Note the addition of a second gray-colored paint on said ceiling-kernel.
424,00:24:18,00:24:20,Ceiling in the cafeteria is white.
425,00:24:21,00:24:23,Ceiling in the storeroom is tan.
426,00:24:26,00:24:27,Take a look at this.
427,00:24:29,00:24:33,Ceiling access panel--gray paint.
428,00:24:33,00:24:35,Right above the bubble tray.
429,00:24:35,00:24:36,BRODY: Someone opened it.
430,00:25:12,00:25:13,(gasps)
431,00:25:22,00:25:26,Are those guys gonna blow up all of our evidence? Not all of it.
432,00:25:26,00:25:29,Whoa!
433,00:25:29,00:25:34,"Bomb squad managed to separate the non-explosive parts from the bomb, served it up for us to analyze."
434,00:25:34,00:25:37,"And I got the ceiling panel over there, too."
435,00:25:37,00:25:39,Morgan said that they were basic pipe bombs.
436,00:25:39,00:25:40,Yeah.
437,00:25:40,00:25:44,"The pipe end caps were loosely sealed, so the detonation would have been all flare, no bang."
438,00:25:44,00:25:46,"Yeah, well, bomber didn't know that."
439,00:25:46,00:25:48,"Mm. Okay, so here's a new theory."
440,00:25:48,00:25:50,Bomber sneaks into the storeroom...
441,00:25:50,00:25:53,SANDERS: Becca picks the wrong time to refill the bubble tray.
442,00:25:53,00:25:55,Unplanned stabbing.
443,00:25:55,00:25:57,Killer flees without detonating the bomb.
444,00:25:57,00:26:00,"So, Sean McHenry is still our prime suspect."
445,00:26:00,00:26:03,"Yeah, Becca's bloody handprint's on his shirt."
446,00:26:03,00:26:05,"All right, what do we have here?"
447,00:26:05,00:26:06,"Uh, ignition device."
448,00:26:06,00:26:09,Some consumer electronics item.
449,00:26:09,00:26:12,I guess Hodges can dig into that. Yeah.
450,00:26:12,00:26:16,Duct tape that wrapped the bomb and attached these to it.
451,00:26:16,00:26:18,Looks like plaster.
452,00:26:18,00:26:21,Too fragile to be shrapnel.
453,00:26:21,00:26:23,Maybe a form of the bomber's signature?
454,00:26:23,00:26:28,These pieces fit together.
455,00:26:28,00:26:29,I'll work on this puzzle.
456,00:26:31,00:26:39,"So, I've been looking through Sean McHenry's Internet and e-mail history for any research he might have been doing, and bomb-making came up empty."
457,00:26:39,00:26:42,But I might have found out why he planted it.
458,00:26:42,00:26:43,Why is that?
459,00:26:43,00:26:47,"Well, he got pink-slipped from his gym-teaching job last week."
460,00:26:47,00:26:50,"That's a bit of a leap to bombing a reunion, isn't it?"
461,00:26:50,00:26:52,It really had nothing to do with the reunion.
462,00:26:52,00:26:58,The school board just voted to eliminate gym class from the district junior highs.
463,00:26:58,00:27:03,"Sean got all bent out of shape, demanding that they rethink their decision."
464,00:27:03,00:27:05,"Of course they didn't, he's out of a job."
465,00:27:05,00:27:10,"Now, where do you think the school board is gonna meet next?"
466,00:27:12,00:27:14,"Sagebrush High, school cafeteria."
467,00:27:14,00:27:19,And the entire school board is gonna be sitting along that very same wall where we found that bomb.
468,00:27:19,00:27:22,So the reunion was not the bomb's target.
469,00:27:22,00:27:23,It was the opportunity to plant it.
470,00:27:23,00:27:25,I'll call Brass.
471,00:27:30,00:27:32,Russell. Yeah?
472,00:27:32,00:27:35,Just hit the liquor store near the high school to check out Sean McHenry's story.
473,00:27:35,00:27:39,Store clerk has him on camera buying whiskey within an hour of Becca's death.
474,00:27:39,00:27:41,"That much we already know from Sean, though, don't we?"
475,00:27:41,00:27:44,But big man on campus left out one big thing.
476,00:27:44,00:27:47,A bright yellow Dumpster on the edge of the store lot.
477,00:27:47,00:27:49,It was begging to be searched.
478,00:27:49,00:27:51,And I found this.
479,00:27:56,00:27:59,"Sean bought whiskey, but he also dumped the weapon."
480,00:27:59,00:28:01,Print this and get it over to Henry.
481,00:28:01,00:28:03,Let's get a profile on the blood.
482,00:28:03,00:28:04,Nice work.
483,00:28:09,00:28:11,"Sean McHenry, LVPD!"
484,00:28:12,00:28:13,Get your hands up.
485,00:28:13,00:28:14,SEAN: What the hell is this?
486,00:28:14,00:28:17,You're under arrest.
487,00:28:17,00:28:18,You too. Out.
488,00:28:20,00:28:23,"Counseling your client, I see."
489,00:28:23,00:28:26,You red-staters still familiar with the notion of warrants?
490,00:28:26,00:28:28,Yes. I have two.
491,00:28:28,00:28:35,"One to arrest Sean for the murder of Becca Sabin, and the other one gives me the right to search for explosives."
492,00:28:35,00:28:36,What?
493,00:28:36,00:28:37,I don't understand.
494,00:28:37,00:28:40,You didn't tell your girlfriend about the bomb you planted at the school?
495,00:28:40,00:28:42,What are you talking about?
496,00:28:42,00:28:46,"Your vendetta against the school board, how you were planning to blow them all away."
497,00:28:46,00:28:49,"You mean, telling them that gym class is the only thing keeping some of these kids sane?"
498,00:28:49,00:28:51,You think I'd hurt people over that?
499,00:28:51,00:28:52,Get him out of here.
500,00:28:52,00:28:54,Well...
501,00:28:54,00:28:56,Can I at least put some clothes on?
502,00:28:58,00:29:00,What you got?
503,00:29:00,00:29:03,I ran DNA on the blood from the knife.
504,00:29:03,00:29:04,It is Becca Sabin's blood.
505,00:29:04,00:29:05,But?
506,00:29:05,00:29:07,There was something odd.
507,00:29:07,00:29:10,The blood was completely dried out.
508,00:29:10,00:29:12,Dehydrated.
509,00:29:12,00:29:15,I had to soak the sample for 20 minutes before it would dissolve.
510,00:29:15,00:29:20,"It was a little frustrating, but finally I had something I could work with."
511,00:29:20,00:29:22,What would cause that level of dehydration?
512,00:29:22,00:29:27,Normally? Long-term aging of the blood or exposure to extreme temperatures.
513,00:29:27,00:29:30,None of which goes along with our story.
514,00:29:30,00:29:34,"Guy plants a bomb, stabs a girl, tosses the knife."
515,00:29:34,00:29:35,Which means there's more to the story.
516,00:29:35,00:29:37,(chuckles) Thanks.
517,00:29:37,00:29:38,Yup.
518,00:29:49,00:29:52,(trilling)
519,00:30:11,00:30:14,SANDERS: This plaster mask was attached to the bomb.
520,00:30:14,00:30:17,Whoever this girl is...
521,00:30:17,00:30:19,...she means something to the bomber.
522,00:30:19,00:30:20,I thought you might recognize her.
523,00:30:23,00:30:24,Her name's Caroline.
524,00:30:24,00:30:25,You know her?
525,00:30:25,00:30:27,I did.
526,00:30:27,00:30:28,Till she killed herself.
527,00:30:35,00:30:37,PHILLIPS: Caroline Hartwell was a fellow misfit.
528,00:30:37,00:30:39,Two years behind me.
529,00:30:39,00:30:42,I used to see her in the library reading all the Ray Bradbury.
530,00:30:42,00:30:44,I liked Ray Bradbury.
531,00:30:46,00:30:53,"Some of the seniors-- Sean McHenry, Becca Sabin-- they used to make fun of her."
532,00:30:53,00:30:56,"The way she dressed, the scar on her lip."
533,00:30:56,00:31:01,"Spring of '98, she was a sophomore, and she hung herself."
534,00:31:04,00:31:05,Tell me about this.
535,00:31:05,00:31:08,Art students would make these masks of themselves.
536,00:31:08,00:31:10,Then they'd put them up on the wall until the end of the year.
537,00:31:10,00:31:15,"So anyone could have taken Caroline's mask, right, and kept it until now, and then used it in the bomb?"
538,00:31:15,00:31:17,Revenge on her behalf.
539,00:31:17,00:31:18,Maybe.
540,00:31:18,00:31:22,"Guys, I got a print off the bomb's duct tape."
541,00:31:22,00:31:25,AFIS match to a work card.
542,00:31:25,00:31:27,Man named Max Dinello.
543,00:31:28,00:31:34,"Also, I found a partial print from him on the inside of the ceiling panel."
544,00:31:34,00:31:36,"Oh, here he is."
545,00:31:36,00:31:37,Class of '98.
546,00:31:39,00:31:41,He was friends with Caroline.
547,00:31:41,00:31:45,There's no Max Dinello on the list of people processed at the reunion.
548,00:31:45,00:31:48,"PHILLIPS: Cut the hair, add a few years..."
549,00:31:48,00:31:49,Hey.
550,00:31:49,00:31:50,Hey.
551,00:31:50,00:31:52,I spoke to him.
552,00:31:52,00:31:54,He must have snuck out before the police arrived.
553,00:31:54,00:31:55,I'll call Brass.
554,00:31:59,00:32:03,"Look, planting the bomb and stabbing Becca have to be related, right?"
555,00:32:03,00:32:05,"Yeah, I think so."
556,00:32:05,00:32:07,Timeline's too tight to be a coincidence.
557,00:32:07,00:32:09,"Yeah, but it doesn't make sense."
558,00:32:09,00:32:17,"If Max Dinello's the bomber and the stabber, then how did the knife end up at the liquor store that Sean McHenry went to?"
559,00:32:17,00:32:19,"Max could have planted it, right?"
560,00:32:19,00:32:26,"I mean, if what he was after was revenge for Caroline, then framing one of her tormentors accomplishes the same thing."
561,00:32:26,00:32:31,But how did Max know that Sean went to that liquor store?
562,00:32:31,00:32:32,"Hey, guys."
563,00:32:32,00:32:35,I was looking up background on Max Dinello.
564,00:32:35,00:32:38,He is a teacher at an alternative school for troubled teens.
565,00:32:38,00:32:40,And I was checking out the school's Web site.
566,00:32:40,00:32:43,I came across this photo.
567,00:32:43,00:32:45,"That's Sean's attorney, Janet Morris."
568,00:32:45,00:32:47,"SANDERS: Yeah, only she's not an attorney anymore."
569,00:32:47,00:32:48,She's a lunch lady.
570,00:32:48,00:32:49,You kidding me?
571,00:32:49,00:32:51,SANDERS: The school confirmed it.
572,00:32:51,00:32:53,She lives at home with her parents in Henderson.
573,00:32:53,00:32:54,Unis are on their way to pick her up now.
574,00:32:54,00:32:57,So Max and Janet are working together?
575,00:32:57,00:33:01,The vengeful outcast and the tarnished golden girl joining forces?
576,00:33:01,00:33:04,"RUSSELL: Max plants the bomb, stabs Becca when she catches him."
577,00:33:04,00:33:08,Janet plants the knife and then frames Sean for the crime.
578,00:33:08,00:33:10,(phone chimes)
579,00:33:10,00:33:11,Gets to play big-shot attorney.
580,00:33:11,00:33:14,Max Dinello's not home.
581,00:33:14,00:33:16,Brass has put a broadcast out on his car.
582,00:33:19,00:33:20,You have a minute?
583,00:33:20,00:33:24,"I was looking for Henry, but he's not around."
584,00:33:24,00:33:25,You want to talk?
585,00:33:25,00:33:28,About how you let the killer flee?
586,00:33:28,00:33:30,Good one. I'm gonna look for Henry.
587,00:33:30,00:33:32,David. David. Come on.
588,00:33:32,00:33:34,I'm kidding. Come in.
589,00:33:34,00:33:37,Grab a lab coat.
590,00:33:37,00:33:42,"You know, even in high school, I knew that these were much cooler than any stupid letterman's jacket."
591,00:33:42,00:33:44,"Attracts a finer breed of woman, too."
592,00:33:44,00:33:46,"Well, you can't argue with Elisabetta."
593,00:33:46,00:33:48,Only because she can't conjugate when she's angry.
594,00:33:48,00:33:49,(chuckles)
595,00:33:49,00:33:51,"So, uh..."
596,00:33:51,00:33:56,"what's got you down? Just wish I had more answers, instead of feeling like that lost kid again."
597,00:33:56,00:34:00,"Even on a normal case, we're not working crossword puzzles here."
598,00:34:00,00:34:02,It can get tough.
599,00:34:02,00:34:07,"And, whether you like it or not, you are involved."
600,00:34:07,00:34:11,"It does help to have a gorgeous Mediterranean goddess waiting for you at home, if you can arrange that."
601,00:34:11,00:34:13,(chuckles) Although...
602,00:34:13,00:34:15,"I have to say, you're doing quite well for yourself."
603,00:34:18,00:34:20,Hmm.
604,00:34:20,00:34:22,Something bothering you?
605,00:34:22,00:34:24,HODGES: The evidence.
606,00:34:24,00:34:27,I'm thinking this bomb is a blast from the past.
607,00:34:27,00:34:28,What do you mean?
608,00:34:28,00:34:30,Start with... duct tape's old.
609,00:34:30,00:34:34,The logo on the end of it was used by the company from '93 to 2000.
610,00:34:34,00:34:40,The ignition components are from a walkie-talkie that was manufactured in 1998.
611,00:34:40,00:34:46,"And the batteries that were in it have a ""use by"" date that puts their sale at spring '98."
612,00:34:46,00:34:54,So what are you saying? I'm saying I don't think that this bomb was placed at the reunion for something that happened in 1998.
613,00:34:54,00:34:57,I think it was placed there in 1998.
614,00:34:57,00:35:00,But we know that the ceiling panel was accessed during the reunion.
615,00:35:00,00:35:02,Right. By your pal Max Dinello.
616,00:35:02,00:35:03,So what was he doing?
617,00:35:03,00:35:06,"Like, adjusting something on the bomb?"
618,00:35:06,00:35:09,Or...defusing it.
619,00:35:09,00:35:13,"When I was lifting prints off of the tape, I noticed these spots."
620,00:35:13,00:35:17,"As if something dripped on it, sapping all the moisture from the adhesive."
621,00:35:17,00:35:20,What could do that?
622,00:35:20,00:35:21,This.
623,00:35:25,00:35:26,Liquid nitrogen.
624,00:35:26,00:35:29,Sometimes used in defusing bombs.
625,00:35:29,00:35:34,"Poured over the components, it temporarily freezes them so that the bomb can be removed safely."
626,00:35:34,00:35:37,I'm almost positive that some liquid nitrogen got splashed onto this bomb.
627,00:35:37,00:35:43,"Henry did say that the blood he found on the knife was dehydrated, like it had been exposed to extreme temperatures."
628,00:35:47,00:35:48,Thanks.
629,00:35:56,00:35:59,"Tissue, tissue. Throat, lip."
630,00:36:12,00:36:18,The sample from Becca's lip doesn't exhibit the intranuclear inclusions of a viral sore.
631,00:36:18,00:36:24,"Instead, the cells have irregular vacuoles and darker nuclear chromatin."
632,00:36:24,00:36:26,Qualities caused by the flash-freezing of tissue.
633,00:36:26,00:36:29,As you'd expect from contact with liquid nitrogen.
634,00:36:29,00:36:41,"Now, ingesting liquid nitrogen could have caused the swollen epiglottis, the irritation that I had attributed to the acid reflux and the injury to the stomach that I had previously deemed an ulcer."
635,00:36:41,00:36:43,They were caused by one event.
636,00:36:43,00:36:45,Ingesting liquid nitrogen.
637,00:36:45,00:36:48,Exactly.
638,00:36:48,00:36:49,"That's very impressive, you guys."
639,00:36:49,00:36:50,"Hey, not me."
640,00:36:50,00:36:52,All David.
641,00:37:02,00:37:03,Mr. Dinello.
642,00:37:06,00:37:11,"Look, I teach my students to own up to their crimes."
643,00:37:11,00:37:13,I failed to do that.
644,00:37:14,00:37:15,But I'll do it now.
645,00:37:17,00:37:20,You don't have to waste your time.
646,00:37:20,00:37:21,I killed Becca Sabin.
647,00:37:24,00:37:29,"Okay. Um, speaking of time, l-let's, um... let's back up 15 years."
648,00:37:29,00:37:37,"You placed a bomb in the ceiling above the spot where Becca and Sean and the other cool kids had lunch every day, right?"
649,00:37:37,00:37:43,"You wanted vengeance for Caroline Hartwell, for what those kids made her do to herself."
650,00:37:43,00:37:47,But you never set that bomb off back then.
651,00:37:47,00:37:48,Why?
652,00:37:49,00:37:51,A teacher.
653,00:37:51,00:37:53,Mr. Miller.
654,00:37:53,00:37:54,Math.
655,00:37:54,00:37:56,He was one of the good ones.
656,00:37:56,00:37:59,He saw some of the things that I had...
657,00:37:59,00:38:02,"(sighs) scrawled in my notebooks, and..."
658,00:38:02,00:38:05,I told him to leave me alone.
659,00:38:05,00:38:08,He told me enough people had done that already.
660,00:38:08,00:38:15,"He didn't know about the bomb or what I was up to, but..."
661,00:38:15,00:38:19,"he said whatever it was, it wasn't worth it."
662,00:38:19,00:38:25,"So, 15 years, you become a teacher yourself, helping kids going through the same stuff."
663,00:38:25,00:38:29,But that bomb--still there.
664,00:38:29,00:38:30,Every day.
665,00:38:30,00:38:33,Surrounded by innocent kids.
666,00:38:33,00:38:36,I was pretty sure that it wouldn't go off accidentally.
667,00:38:37,00:38:39,I told myself that. For years.
668,00:38:39,00:38:41,But there was always a chance.
669,00:38:41,00:38:44,"And if that bomb did go off, hurt somebody..."
670,00:38:44,00:38:49,"Then everything that I had done to change, to help my students change, it all would've been wiped out."
671,00:38:49,00:38:54,So the reunion was a chance for you to sneak back in and make sure that didn't happen.
672,00:39:00,00:39:01,What are you doing?
673,00:39:04,00:39:06,(coughing)
674,00:39:06,00:39:08,Why didn't you just report the bomb to the police?
675,00:39:08,00:39:19,"With everything that's been in the news, I couldn't bear the kids at that school, teachers like Mr. Miller, hearing that the same thing had almost happened at Sagebrush High, too."
676,00:39:19,00:39:23,"So, how does that lead to a stabbing?"
677,00:39:23,00:39:26,MAX: The liquid nitrogen was choking her.
678,00:39:26,00:39:28,There was no time. I had to do something.
679,00:39:28,00:39:31,(choking)
680,00:39:31,00:39:33,"Shh, shh! Relax, relax, relax."
681,00:39:33,00:39:36,An emergency tracheotomy.
682,00:39:36,00:39:38,"She was struggling. Fighting him, so..."
683,00:39:38,00:39:40,it didn't work.
684,00:39:40,00:39:42,MAX: She wouldn't hold still.
685,00:39:42,00:39:44,She was terrified of me.
686,00:39:49,00:39:51,And then she was gone.
687,00:39:51,00:39:54,Max wanted to turn himself in.
688,00:39:54,00:39:55,I told him not to.
689,00:39:55,00:39:57,He was just trying to do good.
690,00:39:57,00:40:00,He didn't deserve to have his life ruined.
691,00:40:00,00:40:02,I put the knife in the nitrogen tank.
692,00:40:02,00:40:04,I told him to get out of there. I'd get rid of the evidence.
693,00:40:04,00:40:08,So Max didn't deserve to have his life ruined?
694,00:40:08,00:40:10,"But Sean McHenry, he did?"
695,00:40:10,00:40:13,You knew about the liquor store and planted the knife there.
696,00:40:13,00:40:15,You framed him.
697,00:40:15,00:40:17,You got to act out your lawyer fantasy.
698,00:40:17,00:40:21,You got to sleep with the class stud as a nice perk.
699,00:40:21,00:40:24,You didn't lie about Harvard.
700,00:40:24,00:40:30,How does somebody at the top of their class end up here?
701,00:40:30,00:40:34,I couldn't wait to get out of high school.
702,00:40:34,00:40:36,Into the real world.
703,00:40:36,00:40:39,I busted my ass.
704,00:40:39,00:40:40,"Undergrad, law school."
705,00:40:40,00:40:45,100-hour weeks as a grunt at a New York firm.
706,00:40:45,00:40:49,But nothing changed.
707,00:40:49,00:40:56,"Pretty got promoted, gossip counted more than achievement, and one day I just broke down because..."
708,00:40:56,00:40:58,High school never ended.
709,00:41:05,00:41:07,So what'll happen to them?
710,00:41:07,00:41:08,Max and Janet?
711,00:41:08,00:41:10,Doesn't look good.
712,00:41:10,00:41:15,"Obstruction, accessory, maybe even manslaughter."
713,00:41:15,00:41:18,You what I think their real crime was?
714,00:41:18,00:41:21,Getting lost in their pasts.
715,00:41:21,00:41:24,Janet trying to live up to old ambitions.
716,00:41:24,00:41:25,Mm-hmm.
717,00:41:25,00:41:29,Max trying to undo an old mistake.
718,00:41:29,00:41:31,I was one of those freaks who liked high school.
719,00:41:31,00:41:33,Come on.
720,00:41:33,00:41:36,"I mean, there are plenty of other contenders for the worst years of my life. (chuckles)"
721,00:41:36,00:41:39,But what do you get for dwelling on them?
722,00:41:39,00:41:45,"Anxiety, uh, self-loathing and high blood pressure."
723,00:41:45,00:41:49,"You know, I think at some point you just have to move forward."
724,00:41:49,00:41:50,(cell phone chiming)
725,00:41:50,00:41:51,Excuse me.
726,00:41:54,00:41:55,"Hi, honey."
727,00:41:57,00:41:59,How long between contractions?
728,00:42:02,00:42:04,(chuckles)
729,00:42:13,00:42:15,Guys.
730,00:42:15,00:42:16,Come on in.
731,00:42:16,00:42:17,(chuckles)
732,00:42:22,00:42:25,(chuckles)
733,00:42:25,00:42:28,"Guys, Joshua Adam Phillips."
734,00:42:31,00:42:35,"Doc, you're first. (whispers): I'd be honored."
735,00:42:35,00:42:38,"Hey, young man. Yes."
736,00:42:38,00:42:40,"Amy, he's perfect."
737,00:42:40,00:42:41,Thank you. (chuckles)
738,00:42:44,00:42:46,I am utterly envious.
739,00:42:50,00:42:52,You're a lucky guy.
740,00:42:52,00:42:53,I am.
