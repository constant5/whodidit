11	00:01:14	00:01:17	Bedspread's undisturbed.	N
12	00:01:18	00:01:21	Trashcan is empty and the inside is spotless.	N
13	00:01:21	00:01:23	It's possible a liner's been removed.	N
14	00:01:25	00:01:27	Take a whiff.	N
15	00:01:27	00:01:29	Smells clean.	N
16	00:01:29	00:01:30	Smells like a hospital.	N
17	00:01:30	00:01:32	Bleaches and deodorizers.	N
18	00:01:32	00:01:36	Killer attacked the victim, then cleaned and sanitized the room.	Y
19	00:01:36	00:01:45	Ah, but here's the smell of the blood still, and all the perfumes in Arabia will not sweeten this little room.	N
20	00:02:25	00:02:27	Her liver temp's 83 degrees.	N
21	00:02:27	00:02:29	She's been dead approximately ten hours.	N
22	00:02:32	00:02:34	I'd like to get a clear photo of her wounds.	N
23	00:02:34	00:02:35	Can we lay her out?	N
24	00:02:35	00:02:36	Oh, yeah. Grab her feet.	N
25	00:02:48	00:02:49	Defensive wounds.	N
26	00:02:51	00:02:53	Incised.	N
27	00:02:53	00:02:55	At least a dozen.	N
28	00:02:55	00:02:57	She did not want to die.	N
29	00:02:57	00:02:59	I just got the call.	N
30	00:03:00	00:03:02	Where's Grissom?	N

35	00:03:14	00:03:15	I need a Phillips.	N
36	00:03:23	00:03:24	What are you doing?	N
37	00:03:24	00:03:28	Well, the stabbing was brutal, but the crime scene is clean.	N
38	00:03:28	00:03:30	No cast-off, no spatter.	N
39	00:03:30	00:03:35	So, I want to know if the killer washed blood down the drain.	Y
40	00:03:49	00:03:51	Swab and phenol this, will ya?	N
41	00:04:03	00:04:05	Blood.	N
42	00:04:05	00:04:08	Label it. Send it to DNA.	N
43	00:04:18	00:04:21	Usually in hotel rooms, we find too many prints.	N
44	00:04:21	00:04:22	Not a single one.	N
45	00:04:23	00:04:25	Just wipes and swipes.	N
46	00:04:27	00:04:29	Ms. Krell was a real nice lady.	N
47	00:04:29	00:04:31	She brought me a Dodger baseball cap.	N
48	00:04:31	00:04:32	Wow. So you were friends?	N
49	00:04:32	00:04:34	Not really.	N
50	00:04:34	00:04:38	Airlines buy a chunk of rooms for their trolley dollies, discounted.	N
51	00:04:38	00:04:40	She's been staying here for a few months.	N
52	00:04:40	00:04:41	So you discovered the body.	N
53	00:04:41	00:04:44	Her supervisor called to say her A.M. flight was canceled.	N
54	00:04:44	00:04:46	She wasn't answering her phone.	N
55	00:04:46	00:04:49	He asked me to make sure she got the message.	N
56	00:04:49	00:04:53	So you knocked on her door, and when she didn't answer, you just went right in?	N
57	00:04:53	00:04:55	Yeah. I got a master key.	N
58	00:04:56	00:04:57	Yeah, I knew that.	N
59	00:04:57	00:04:59	Does the hotel have surveillance?	N
60	00:04:59	00:05:01	Nope.	N
61	00:05:01	00:05:02	Thank you. You've been a big help.	N
62	00:05:02	00:05:03	Right on.	N

67	00:05:12	00:05:13	Thank you. I'll let you know.	Y
68	00:05:13	00:05:18	Detective, if this hits the media, this is really going to hurt our business.	Y
69	00:05:18	00:05:20	What are you asking me?	Y
70	00:05:20	00:05:23	Anything you can do to keep it out of the press?	N
71	00:05:23	00:05:24	Look, I'm trying to catch a killer.	Y
72	00:05:24	00:05:27	I got no control over the press.	N
73	00:05:27	00:05:30	If this makes the news, then it is what it is.	N
74	00:05:54	00:05:56	Hey. Victim's in the bedroom.	N
75	00:05:56	00:05:58	Ty Hawkins, 12.	N

77	00:06:02	00:06:03	found him like this.	N
78	00:06:07	00:06:08	Beaten to death.	N
79	00:06:08	00:06:10	This many blows, it was personal.	N
80	00:06:10	00:06:13	Liver temp makes T.O.D. around midnight.	N
81	00:06:13	00:06:14	No sign of forced entry.	N
82	00:06:14	00:06:15	nothing's missing.	N
83	00:06:15	00:06:19	All the doors and windows were locked except for the screen door.	N
84	00:06:19	00:06:21	Parents claim they keep that locked.	N
85	00:06:21	00:06:23	You find a weapon?	N
86	00:06:23	00:06:24	Negative.	N
87	00:06:24	00:06:26	Family's been transported down to the station.	Y
88	00:06:26	00:06:27	I'm gonna go down and take their statement.	Y
89	00:06:27	00:06:30	Hey, when you're done here, roll by. We'll ink them.	Y
90	00:06:30	00:06:32	You got it.	N
91	00:06:35	00:06:37	Boy's not even safe in his own bed.	N
92	00:06:37	00:06:39	I'll take the inside.	N
93	00:06:39	00:06:42	Yeah, I could use the fresh air.	N
94	00:08:51	00:08:54	Found a pile of pipes by the side of the house One seems to be missing.	N
95	00:08:54	00:08:57	This is an exemplar of a possible murder weapon.	N
96	00:08:57	00:09:00	And I cast a shoe impression just outside the kid's bedroom window.	N
97	00:09:00	00:09:03	Also some graffiti on the window-- B-R-A-T.	N
98	00:09:03	00:09:05	Maybe somebody had it in for the kid.	N
99	00:09:05	00:09:09	Well, I bagged the bloody sheets from the bed.	N
100	00:09:09	00:09:13	Found boxers, a T-shirt and a fitted sheet in the washer.	N
101	00:09:13	00:09:16	ALS'd for blood, found urine.	N
102	00:09:16	00:09:21	Mm. Well, whoever killed the boy knew how to get in and out of this house without waking the family.	Y
103	00:09:26	00:09:27	No mystery here.	N
104	00:09:27	00:09:30	Ms. Krell was violently stabbed to death.	N
105	00:09:30	00:09:31	C.O.D. exsanguination.	N
106	00:09:31	00:09:32	SAE kit?	N
107	00:09:32	00:09:33	She was raped.	N
108	00:09:33	00:09:40	Contusions to the vaginal introitus and an eighth-inch hemorrhagic laceration at the vaginal fourchette.	N
109	00:09:40	00:09:42	00 position. The attack was brutal.	N
110	00:09:42	00:09:44	Aren't they always?	N
111	00:09:44	00:09:47	I don't know why people think that rape has anything to do with sex.	N
112	00:09:48	00:09:51	If a guy just wants sex, he can hire a hooker.	N
113	00:09:51	00:09:52	What else?	N
114	00:09:52	00:09:53	Well, there is some good news.	N
115	00:09:53	00:09:55	Motile sperm in the wet mount.	N
116	00:09:55	00:09:58	I've sent the kit to DNA for analysis.	N
117	00:10:01	00:10:03	Ecklie, what's up?	N
118	00:10:03	00:10:06	I paged Grissom.	N
119	00:10:06	00:10:10	And he paged me.	N
120	00:10:10	00:10:12	How can I help you?	N
121	00:10:12	00:10:22	Five years ago, there was this, uh, day-shift case, Homicide. The victim was a flight attendant named Sue Stein from Palo Alto, California.	N
122	00:10:22	00:10:25	She was raped and murdered in a local hotel.	N
123	00:10:25	00:10:27	Killer was never apprehended.	Y
124	00:10:37	00:10:41	Vic's clothing and suitcase were missing.	Y
125	00:10:41	00:10:43	Room was immaculate, smelled like disinfectant.	N
126	00:10:43	00:10:44	Same signature.	N
127	00:10:44	00:10:45	One difference.	N
128	00:10:45	00:10:49	In the prior case, body was found in a first floor room.	N
129	00:10:49	00:10:51	Sliding glass door facing the pool was unlocked.	N
130	00:10:52	00:10:53	Ms. Krell was killed on the second floor.	N
131	00:10:53	00:10:55	There was only one way into her room.	N
132	00:10:55	00:10:59	Was there semen present in Sue Stein's SAE kit?	N
133	00:10:59	00:11:00	Yeah. Ran it through CODIS. No hit.	N
134	00:11:00	00:11:04	I asked Mia to compare it with the semen from the recent attack.	N
135	00:11:04	00:11:06	Is that fingerprint from your crime scene?	N
136	00:11:06	00:11:12	Only print we found. Impressed in Sue's blood on the bedspread near her hips.	N
137	00:11:12	00:11:16	Underlying pattern on the fabric made it impossible to read.	N
138	00:11:16	00:11:17	That was then.	N
139	00:11:17	00:11:19	This is now.	N
140	00:11:22	00:11:24	My son's dead. Why are you fingerprinting me?	N
141	00:11:24	00:11:28	The crime lab is going to dust your house for prints, so I need to know which ones are yours.	N
142	00:11:28	00:11:32	Now, your wife said that you both went to bed after the news.	N
143	00:11:32	00:11:33	I already told you that.	N
144	00:11:33	00:11:34	Twice.	N
145	00:11:34	00:11:37	You know, I... I got questions, too, you know.	N
146	00:11:37	00:11:40	Why Ty?	N
147	00:11:42	00:11:44	Why not me?	N
148	00:11:44	00:11:49	How could my wife and I sleep... ( sighing )	N
149	00:11:49	00:11:51	through it all?	N
150	00:11:51	00:11:54	Mr. Hawkins, would you stand up, facing me, so I can take some photos?	N
151	00:11:54	00:11:56	Is this really necessary?	N
152	00:11:56	00:11:58	Please, just let him do his job.	N
153	00:11:58	00:11:59	Sir...	N
154	00:12:12	00:12:13	Open up.	N
155	00:12:17	00:12:19	I'll be needing to take your shoes.	N
156	00:12:19	00:12:22	You can wear some booties home.	N
157	00:12:22	00:12:23	What now?	N
158	00:12:23	00:12:25	You and your wife are free to go.	N
159	00:12:25	00:12:27	What about Matt?	Y
160	00:12:27	00:12:32	He has to stay here in protective custody until this is resolved.	N
161	00:12:38	00:12:39	Yvonne.	N
162	00:12:39	00:12:40	Hey.	N
163	00:12:43	00:12:44	They're keeping Matt.	Y
164	00:12:44	00:12:46	I know. He'll be home soon.	N
165	00:12:47	00:12:48	It's just procedure.	N
166	00:12:48	00:12:50	Right? Right.	N
167	00:12:50	00:12:51	Can we at least speak to him?	Y
168	00:12:51	00:12:53	Can't allow that.	N
169	00:12:59	00:13:01	Come on, let-let's go.	N
170	00:13:01	00:13:02	Come on.	N
171	00:13:09	00:13:10	You just gonna let them go?	N
172	00:13:10	00:13:12	Neither has a record, no motive.	N
173	00:13:12	00:13:13	There's no blood on them.	N
174	00:13:13	00:13:15	Well, they could've showered, tossed their clothes.	N
175	00:13:15	00:13:17	Their grief is not an act.	N
176	00:13:17	00:13:18	Yeah, based on what?	N
177	00:13:18	00:13:20	Years of listening to the parents of dead children.	N
178	00:13:22	00:13:24	Let's go talk to this kid.	Y
179	00:13:26	00:13:27	Hey, Mia.	N
180	00:13:33	00:13:39	Let me guess, you're listening to something classy like Jessica or Ashlee.	N
181	00:13:46	00:13:47	It's... Jean-Paul Sartre.	N
182	00:13:48	00:13:49	Huis Clos.	N
183	00:13:49	00:13:51	No Exit.	N
184	00:13:51	00:13:53	It loses something in a translation.	N
185	00:13:53	00:13:55	Oui, oui.	N
186	00:13:55	00:14:01	The blood from the hairy wad that you found in the drain is consistent with the victim.	N
187	00:14:01	00:14:03	And what about the semen from Martha's SAE?	N
188	00:14:03	00:14:06	That's consistent with the DNA from the first attack.	N
189	00:14:06	00:14:09	You are looking at the same rapist.	Y
190	00:14:09	00:14:10	I want to show you something.	N
191	00:14:10	00:14:12	Really?	N
192	00:14:21	00:14:24	This guy's immune system doesn't recognize his own sperm.	Y
193	00:14:24	00:14:26	Antibodies are attacking the little guys.	N
194	00:14:27	00:14:28	I read about this phenomenon in a forensic journal...	N
195	00:14:28	00:14:31	November, 2003.	N
196	00:14:31	00:14:33	Killer had a vasectomy, then had it reversed.	N
197	00:14:33	00:14:34	Oui, oui.	N
198	00:14:34	00:14:35	Thanks, Mia.	N
199	00:14:37	00:14:41	How could a boy have made someone so mad?	N
200	00:14:41	00:14:43	COD is blunt-force trauma.	N
201	00:14:43	00:14:44	I counted 14 separate blows.	N
202	00:14:45	00:14:46	Several more were coinciding.	N
203	00:14:46	00:14:49	Cylindrical weapon, about an inch in diameter.	N
204	00:14:49	00:14:51	Consistent with a pipe?	N
205	00:14:51	00:14:54	Yeah. In fact, check this out.	N
206	00:14:54	00:14:58	Thread pattern's consistent with the end of a pipe.	N
207	00:15:01	00:15:03	He's got no defense wounds.	N
208	00:15:04	00:15:07	Yeah. My guess, he never woke up.	N
209	00:15:09	00:15:11	You're not fooling me, kid.	Y
210	00:15:11	00:15:15	The second I laid eyes on you, I knew how it went down.	Y
211	00:15:15	00:15:25	You took a pipe from the backyard, you went into Ty's bedroom, and while he was sleeping, you beat his brains to a pulp.	Y
212	00:15:25	00:15:28	Now, what the hell's wrong with you, kid?	Y
213	00:15:28	00:15:30	Your little brother is dead.	Y
214	00:15:30	00:15:33	What did he ever do to you?	Y
215	00:15:33	00:15:35	Now, don't look at him. He can't help you.	Y
216	00:15:35	00:15:38	Nobody can help you. You're going to prison.	Y
217	00:15:38	00:15:43	At 14, that means life.	N
218	00:15:43	00:15:44	I'm talking to you, you little...!	Y
219	00:15:45	00:15:45	Detective...	N
220	00:15:45	00:15:50	can I have a word with you outside, please?	N
221	00:15:57	00:16:02	We don't have enough evidence to suggest that that boy killed his brother.	Y
222	00:16:02	00:16:05	What are you getting at?	N
223	00:16:05	00:16:07	I'm saying I'm not sure if threatening him is the right tactic right now.	N
224	00:16:07	00:16:08	I found no blood on his clothes.	Y
225	00:16:09	00:16:11	The screen door could have been the point of entry.	N
226	00:16:11	00:16:17	I mean, have you considered asking him what he heard or-or saw before you just put the full court press on him?	Y
227	00:16:17	00:16:19	I don't tell you how to collect the evidence.	N
228	00:16:19	00:16:22	No, you don't. Look, there's no disrespect here, okay?	N
229	00:16:22	00:16:23	We're all on the same team.	N
230	00:16:23	00:16:27	Then get to the lab and get me something that I can use.	N
231	00:16:32	00:16:34	Hey.	N
232	00:16:34	00:16:39	Hey. Call me a geek, but background subtraction application software is the bomb.	N
233	00:16:39	00:16:41	Only geeks still say the bomb.	N
234	00:16:41	00:16:45	But it you ask me, geeks should be revered.	N
235	00:16:45	00:16:49	Okay. Um, the technology's pretty new.	N
236	00:16:49	00:16:52	You'll get hammered on cross, but it definitely works.	N
237	00:16:52	00:16:53	Okay, check it out.	N
238	00:16:53	00:17:03	So the fingerprint is blood-red-- that's the shade we use for the color identifier-- and now the preprogrammed algorithm is just removing all the other colors from the fabric, and we're left with just the print. It's...	N
239	00:17:03	00:17:04	Mind if I watch?	N
240	00:17:04	00:17:07	Voyeur, huh?	N
241	00:17:07	00:17:08	I like that.	N
242	00:17:08	00:17:08	Geek.	N
243	00:17:12	00:17:14	Wow. Yeah.	N
244	00:17:15	00:17:17	Right. ( taps keys )	N
245	00:17:17	00:17:21	Scan this into I-AFIS, and here we go.	N
246	00:17:27	00:17:30	Got yourself a hit.	N
247	00:17:30	00:17:32	Jesse Acheson. 38.	N
248	00:17:32	00:17:35	Multiple convictions, cocaine possession, intent to sell.	N
249	00:17:35	00:17:39	In and out of prison for the past... seven years.	N
250	00:17:39	00:17:41	Was he in or out on May 12, 1999?	N
251	00:17:41	00:17:43	Out.	N
252	00:17:43	00:17:44	What about last night?	N
253	00:17:44	00:17:46	Released six months ago. Living in Henderson.	N
254	00:17:47	00:17:48	Geeks rule.	N
255	00:17:54	00:17:56	Who is it?	N
256	00:17:56	00:17:57	Las Vegas Police.	N
257	00:18:00	00:18:03	We're looking for Jesse Acheson.	N
258	00:18:03	00:18:10	Hey, look, my husband hasn't used since he got out of the joint, so whatever you think he did, you're wrong.	N
259	00:18:10	00:18:11	Do you know where he is?	N
260	00:18:11	00:18:13	No idea.	N
261	00:18:13	00:18:16	Well, your marriage is just full of romance, huh?	N
262	00:18:16	00:18:18	May we come in?	N
263	00:18:18	00:18:19	Nah, I don't think so.	N
264	00:18:19	00:18:20	Just one more question.	N
265	00:18:20	00:18:22	Do you happen to know where he was last night?	N
266	00:18:22	00:18:25	No. I, uh, I haven't seen him in days.	N
267	00:18:26	00:18:27	Thank you.	N
268	00:18:28	00:18:30	That was fun.	N
269	00:18:32	00:18:37	Brass, you guys get in your cars, drive around the block.	N
270	00:18:37	00:18:38	Pick me up in five minutes.	N
271	00:18:38	00:18:40	We'll be close.	N
272	00:18:49	00:18:51	Jesse, cops were just here.	N
273	00:18:51	00:18:52	What the hell's going on?	N
274	00:18:54	00:18:56	No, I didn't tell them where you are!	N
275	00:18:56	00:18:57	I don't know where the hell you are!	N
276	00:18:57	00:18:59	When are you coming home?	N
277	00:18:59	00:19:01	Jesse...	N
278	00:19:01	00:19:02	Damn you!	N
279	00:20:03	00:20:10	The shoe impression outside Ty's window matches the brother's Yeah, I got a hair off of Ty's T-shirt.	Y
280	00:20:10	00:20:12	Also consistent with Matt.	Y
281	00:20:12	00:20:16	Either of which could be related to the murder or just a result of two brothers living together.	Y
282	00:20:16	00:20:18	Yeah. What's in the bindle?	N
283	00:20:18	00:20:19	Uh, Blue fibers.	N
284	00:20:19	00:20:21	Got them off the vic's T-shirt.	N
285	00:20:21	00:20:24	Nobody in the family was wearing anything blue.	Y
286	00:20:24	00:20:27	No, but you know, could be from a blanket, a carpet, towel.	N
287	00:20:27	00:20:29	I'll take them to Trace.	N
288	00:20:29	00:20:34	Hey, I am concerned that Detective Cavaliere's moving ahead of Forensics on this one.	N
289	00:20:34	00:20:36	He can move as fast as wants.	N
290	00:20:36	00:20:38	The D.A. won't file without the physical evidence.	N
291	00:20:38	00:20:41	Right now, we got nothing.	N
292	00:20:41	00:20:45	03 p.m. today.	N
293	00:20:45	00:20:49	I secured a 2703-D court order for the number she was calling.	N
294	00:20:49	00:20:51	It was a cell phone.	N
295	00:20:51	00:20:56	I contacted the cell phone company and found out that Jesse answered his phone near Tower 8, phase West.	N
296	00:20:56	00:21:01	Given the signal strength, he was within two blocks of the tower.	N
297	00:21:01	00:21:08	His wife said that she hasn't seen him in several days, so I had Homicide check registration at all the hotels within the yellow area.	N
298	00:21:08	00:21:12	He is booked at the Tangiers.	N
299	00:21:12	00:21:14	Well done.	N
300	00:21:14	00:21:19	Get this-- the rapist's semen came back positive for cocaine.	Y
301	00:21:19	00:21:22	We don't usually run a panel for semen, Greg.	N
302	00:21:22	00:21:27	I know that, but given our suspect's priors for blow, I had a tech run an immunoassay specific to the drug.	N
303	00:21:27	00:21:31	Wow. You guys are rendering me obsolete.	N
304	00:21:32	00:21:37	So, Jesse gets coked up, he commits the crime, he drives down to the Strip and he checks into the Tangiers.	N
305	00:21:37	00:21:38	The Gift Show's in town.	N
306	00:21:38	00:21:40	There aren't any vacancies on the Strip.	N
307	00:21:40	00:21:43	Well, his wife said that she hadn't seen him in a few days.	N
308	00:21:43	00:21:49	Maybe he's back in the game again, selling coke to out-of-town businessmen from the comfort and security of his hotel room.	N
309	00:21:49	00:21:56	So, he takes a break from his job, rapes and kills the vic at another hotel, and then goes back to work?	N
310	00:21:56	00:21:59	Even cokeheads need a diversion now and then.	N
311	00:22:01	00:22:03	Hi, Stokes. Solve the case?	N
312	00:22:03	00:22:05	I'm getting there.	N
313	00:22:05	00:22:07	Nothing definitive as of yet.	N
314	00:22:07	00:22:10	Which means you can't hold Matt Hawkins for longer than his 24 hours.	Y
315	00:22:10	00:22:12	Really? Well, you know, uh...	N
316	00:22:12	00:22:14	I got a signed confession.	N
317	00:22:14	00:22:16	Really? Mm-hmm.	N
318	00:22:16	00:22:19	Sort of kicks the crap out of your evidence, now, doesn't it?	N
319	00:22:19	00:22:20	He confessed? Signed. Check it.	Y
320	00:22:21	00:22:22	Did you beat it out of him?	Y
321	00:22:22	00:22:25	No, I used science, kind of like you guys.	N
322	00:22:25	00:22:26	Mm, how's that?	N
323	00:22:26	00:22:28	I put him on a Computer Voice Stress Analyzer.	Y
324	00:22:28	00:22:31	Once I caught him lying, he gave it right up.	Y
325	00:22:31	00:22:34	That device has been discredited for years.	N
326	00:22:34	00:22:36	Well, check their Web site.	N
327	00:22:36	00:22:39	It's still used in 1,400 state and local agencies.	N
328	00:22:39	00:22:40	Well, not in Las Vegas.	N
329	00:22:41	00:22:42	Or anywhere else in this state.	N
330	00:22:42	00:22:48	Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession?	N
331	00:22:48	00:22:49	He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.	Y
332	00:22:50	00:22:54	Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.	Y
333	00:22:54	00:22:56	He tell you why he did it?	Y
334	00:22:56	00:22:58	No, but he will.	Y
335	00:22:58	00:23:03	Hey, listen, Stokes, thanks for trying to help, but we got him.	Y
336	00:23:04	00:23:06	Okay.	N
337	00:23:08	00:23:10	So, I just got back from the Tangiers.	N
338	00:23:10	00:23:15	The GM won't let us into Jesse Acheson's room without a search warrant, and the judge denied our request.	N
339	00:23:16	00:23:17	I'll talk to the judge.	N
340	00:23:17	00:23:19	I'll bring Acheson in for questioning, I guess.	N
341	00:23:19	00:23:23	Could you just keep him under surveillance for now, let Greg tag along with your guy?	N
342	00:23:23	00:23:24	We might learn something.	N
343	00:23:24	00:23:27	Sure, I'll get him a bag of donuts.	N
344	00:23:27	00:23:30	I was testifying today.	N
345	00:23:30	00:23:31	I ran into the D.A.	N
346	00:23:31	00:23:34	He filled me in on your case.	N
347	00:23:34	00:23:38	Looks like Matt Hawkins' confession is gonna stand up in court.	Y
348	00:23:38	00:23:44	Suspects are tricked into confessing all the time, but I'm telling you, Cavaliere intimidated that boy.	Y
349	00:23:44	00:23:46	Man, he would've signed anything.	Y
350	00:23:46	00:23:47	So you think he's innocent?	Y
351	00:23:48	00:23:51	Could be. I checked the crime stats for the Hawkins neighborhood.	Y
352	00:23:51	00:23:53	There's been a rash of nuisance calls.	N
353	00:23:53	00:23:57	There's some homeless guy running around out there peeping in windows, urinating in public, attempted B and E.	N
354	00:23:58	00:23:59	Sounds like a suspect.	N
355	00:23:59	00:24:03	I'm gonna go back out there, see if the Hawkins know anything about it.	Y
356	00:24:03	00:24:05	Need some help?	N
357	00:24:05	00:24:06	You got that kind of time?	N
358	00:24:06	00:24:08	I'll meet you in the car.	N
359	00:24:08	00:24:09	Thanks, Warrick.	N
360	00:24:09	00:24:17	You expect me to invade Mr. Acheson's privacy based upon a five-year-old fingerprint that was manipulated on a computer?	N
361	00:24:17	00:24:19	It wasn't manipulated-- it was processed.	N
362	00:24:19	00:24:23	That's what we do. Try getting that one past a defense attorney.	N
363	00:24:23	00:24:27	It's one thing to send a print through AFIS; it's another thing to use...	N
364	00:24:27	00:24:46	a background subtraction algorithm to isolate the print from a bedspread. It's not my fault that the courts lag behind our technology. Gil, I'm sympathetic to your request, but if I grant a warrant based upon this print, and the print is later thrown out of court, then everything you find as a result of it would be excluded, and your pattern rapist could be back on the street.	Y
365	00:24:46	00:24:51	Give me something else-- I'll be happy to grant you a warrant. Your Honor, I need the warrant in order to find something else.	N
366	00:24:51	00:24:54	You'll find another way.	N
367	00:25:02	00:25:04	Kind of like bird-watching, ain't it?	N
368	00:25:04	00:25:06	I wouldn't know.	N
369	00:25:06	00:25:08	You bored?	N
370	00:25:08	00:25:10	I'm bored.	N
371	00:25:12	00:25:14	So, I got a question.	N
372	00:25:14	00:25:16	I hear the killer completely wiped down the crime scene.	Y
373	00:25:16	00:25:19	So why do you think he left his semen behind?	Y
374	00:25:19	00:25:20	Could've worn a condom.	N
375	00:25:20	00:25:29	Well, before committing a crime, a typical serial rapist will often masturbate to his perfect rape-murder fantasy.	N
376	00:25:29	00:25:35	Didn't wear a condom then, didn't want to wear one during the act.	N
377	00:25:35	00:25:36	Besides, the DNA isn't on file.	N
378	00:25:36	00:25:38	It wasn't much of a risk.	N
379	00:25:44	00:25:45	Litterbug.	N
380	00:25:45	00:25:49	CSIs don't mind the bugs.	N
381	00:25:52	00:25:58	If the DNA on this cup matches the seminal DNA, Grissom won't need a warrant.	N
382	00:25:58	00:26:00	We'll be making an arrest.	N
383	00:26:04	00:26:06	We're not unfit parents.	N
384	00:26:06	00:26:09	Please, we just want to speak with our son.	Y
385	00:26:09	00:26:13	We called the detective, but no one will tell us anything.	N
386	00:26:13	00:26:16	Right now your son's under investigation.	Y
387	00:26:17	00:26:22	What? Yeah, the detective asked him if he wanted a parent or advocate present at the interrogation.	Y
388	00:26:22	00:26:25	He's 14 years old, so it's his right to say no.	Y
389	00:26:25	00:26:27	But he's just a kid.	Y
390	00:26:27	00:26:28	I mean, he just lost his brother.	Y
391	00:26:29	00:26:30	Matt's sensitive.	Y
392	00:26:30	00:26:31	He doesn't handle stress well.	Y
393	00:26:31	00:26:33	If we-we-we could just talk to him.	Y
394	00:26:33	00:26:35	He may need a change of clothes.	Y
395	00:26:36	00:26:38	Were those his clothes in the washer?	Y
396	00:26:38	00:26:40	Yeah.	N
397	00:26:40	00:26:46	Okay, we'll see what we can do about getting him something to wear. In the meantime, if you could just answer the question.	Y
398	00:26:46	00:26:49	You want to know about that homeless guy?	N
399	00:26:50	00:26:51	Yeah. He's nuts.	N
400	00:26:51	00:26:54	He-he scared the boys once or twice, but...	Y
401	00:26:54	00:26:55	How did he scare them?	Y
402	00:26:55	00:26:57	Ty saw him writing something on the window.	N
403	00:26:57	00:26:58	Was it Brat?	N
404	00:26:59	00:26:59	Yeah.	N
405	00:27:00	00:27:01	I chased him away.	N
406	00:27:02	00:27:03	Matt...	Y
407	00:27:03	00:27:04	cleaned off the window.	N
408	00:27:04	00:27:07	That would explain the shoe impressions outside the bedroom window.	N
409	00:27:07	00:27:10	You're thinking that that guy had something to do with what happened?	N
410	00:27:10	00:27:12	Well, that's what we're trying to find out.	N
411	00:27:12	00:27:15	Oh, God. I knew we should've called the cops.	N
412	00:27:15	00:27:16	When was the last time that you saw him?	N
413	00:27:17	00:27:18	I jog through that park every evening.	N
414	00:27:19	00:27:22	Um, he's got this, uh...	N
415	00:27:22	00:27:27	makeshift tent thing set up by the playground.	N
416	00:27:34	00:27:37	What? Hey! Stop it! Come on!	N
417	00:27:37	00:27:38	Get up! Let me... let me go!	N
418	00:27:38	00:27:41	Let go of me! Stop it!	N
419	00:27:42	00:27:43	Hey, what's your name? What?	N
420	00:27:43	00:27:45	Tell the gentlemen your name.	N
421	00:27:45	00:27:48	Walter! My name is Walter!	N
422	00:27:48	00:27:50	Walter, that's a nice blue sweater.	N
423	00:27:50	00:27:51	Where'd you get it?	N
424	00:27:51	00:27:53	What? I said I like your sweater-- where'd you get it?	N
425	00:27:53	00:27:55	It's mine! Oh, it's yours?	N
426	00:27:55	00:27:57	Yes, this is my sweater!	N
427	00:27:57	00:27:58	Whose blood is it on your sweater, Walter?	N
428	00:27:58	00:28:01	We're gonna give you a nice warm place to sleep tonight, partner.	N
429	00:28:01	00:28:03	Suspicion of murder.	N
430	00:28:03	00:28:05	No! No!	N
431	00:28:05	00:28:08	( screaming ) Easy with the sweater.	N
432	00:28:08	00:28:10	It's evidence.	N
433	00:28:10	00:28:20	So, I processed the DNA from the coffee cup, and it turns out that there were two contributions on the lip, which means that your coffee shop recycles, and not in the good way.	N
434	00:28:20	00:28:21	Gross.	N
435	00:28:21	00:28:27	Bad news is that neither of the contributions is consistent with the semen that was recovered from the crime scene.	N
436	00:28:27	00:28:32	If Acheson didn't rape Sue Stein, what is his print doing on the bedspread?	N
437	00:28:32	00:28:35	Well, I certainly didn't kill anyone, and...	N
438	00:28:35	00:28:37	I do not know how my fingerprint got there.	N
439	00:28:37	00:28:40	We don't think that you did rape or kill anyone.	N
440	00:28:40	00:28:45	We simply want to know how your fingerprint ended up at a murder scene five years ago.	N
441	00:28:45	00:28:57	Look, Jesse, we appreciate you coming down here voluntarily, but if you clam up, we're gonna have to file an obstruction of justice charge, and that's not good... for you.	N
442	00:28:57	00:28:59	Let's make it easy on yourself.	N
443	00:29:01	00:29:04	What were you doing in Sue Stein's hotel room?	N
444	00:29:06	00:29:08	You won't believe me.	N
445	00:29:08	00:29:10	Try us.	N
446	00:29:12	00:29:15	I did go to see Sue that night.	N
447	00:29:15	00:29:17	Sue.	N
448	00:29:18	00:29:19	Come on, girl, wake up.	N
449	00:29:27	00:29:29	You just took off?	N
450	00:29:29	00:29:32	You didn't bother to report a murder?	N
451	00:29:32	00:29:37	Ma'am, I... I got a record, and I was on probation.	N
452	00:29:37	00:29:40	If I'd done all of that, I'd have been...	N
453	00:29:40	00:29:42	suspect numero uno.	N
454	00:29:42	00:29:43	All right, let's cut to the chase.	N
455	00:29:43	00:29:46	You were there to sell her blow, right?	N
456	00:29:50	00:29:52	I don't need a lawyer, right?	N
457	00:29:52	00:29:53	I mean, it's off the record?	N
458	00:29:54	00:29:56	We're just having a little chat here.	N
459	00:29:59	00:30:02	That's why she left the door unlocked.	N
460	00:30:02	00:30:05	We'd been doing it that way for years.	N
461	00:30:05	00:30:10	Whenever Sue came to town, I always took care of her.	N
462	00:30:14	00:30:17	I'm really sorry.	N
463	00:30:18	00:30:21	She was my friend.	N
464	00:30:21	00:30:24	I wish I could be more help.	N
465	00:30:27	00:30:29	Stokes. Hey, man.	N
466	00:30:29	00:30:31	What the hell are you doing?	N
467	00:30:31	00:30:35	Are you trying to screw with my case? I'm just following the evidence, and it led me to another suspect.	N
468	00:30:35	00:30:38	I think you're gonna want to talk to him in the interest of justice.	N
469	00:30:38	00:30:40	What, are you trying to help the defense now?	N
470	00:30:40	00:30:44	You know any good defense is gonna bring up a rush to judgment here. Come on!	N
471	00:30:44	00:30:46	Chris, you put another interviewed suspect on your list.	N
472	00:30:46	00:30:48	It shows due diligence.	N
473	00:30:48	00:30:50	Let's go.	N
474	00:30:53	00:30:55	Your sweater's been analyzed, Walter.	N
475	00:30:55	00:30:58	Found bloodstains from a murdered boy on it.	N
476	00:30:58	00:31:00	It's not my sweater.	N
477	00:31:00	00:31:03	You already told me it was yours.	N
478	00:31:03	00:31:05	Finders keepers.	N
479	00:31:05	00:31:07	It wasn't always mine, though.	N
480	00:31:07	00:31:10	Where did you find it? On a bench.	N
481	00:31:10	00:31:12	By the basketball courts.	N
482	00:31:18	00:31:20	I was cold.	N
483	00:31:20	00:31:21	Hey, man...	N
484	00:31:21	00:31:24	if you're lying...	N
485	00:31:24	00:31:25	I'm not lying.	N
486	00:31:27	00:31:28	I'm not lying!	N
487	00:31:28	00:31:30	So when did you find it?	N
488	00:31:31	00:31:32	Yesterday.	N
489	00:31:32	00:31:34	No, um, a few days ago.	N
490	00:31:36	00:31:38	I don't remember.	N
491	00:31:38	00:31:40	Put him in lockup-- maybe it'll help his memory.	N
492	00:31:47	00:31:49	Stokes...	N
493	00:31:49	00:31:51	I got a signed confession.	N
494	00:31:51	00:31:53	You got a bum in a bloody sweater.	N
495	00:31:53	00:31:56	What are you gonna do about it?	N
496	00:32:28	00:32:29	Hey, Catherine. Yeah?	N
497	00:32:29	00:32:31	DNA finished up with the blue sweater and I processed it.	N
498	00:32:32	00:32:32	Anything probative?	N
499	00:32:33	00:32:37	I ran it under the UV light and out popped one of those invisible dry cleaner ID stamps, you know?	N
500	00:32:37	00:32:38	Yeah?	N
501	00:32:38	00:32:41	I called the dry cleaner, they gave me a name.	N
502	00:32:41	00:32:44	Mr. Hawkins, is that your sweater?	N
503	00:32:47	00:32:48	Yeah...	N
504	00:32:48	00:32:49	it looks like my sweater.	N
505	00:32:49	00:32:50	Where'd you find it?	N
506	00:32:50	00:32:52	Did you give it away?	N
507	00:32:52	00:32:55	No, but I haven't seen it n a while, though. Why?	N
508	00:32:55	00:32:58	It's got Ty's blood on it.	N
509	00:33:01	00:33:04	Do I need a lawyer?	N
510	00:33:04	00:33:06	That's your call, sir.	N
511	00:33:13	00:33:14	You called me?	N
512	00:33:14	00:33:18	Yeah, Mia sent me that wad of hair that you pulled out of the hotel drain.	N
513	00:33:18	00:33:20	It's coated in bleach.	N
514	00:33:20	00:33:23	I'm thinking the killer must've poured the stuff down the drain.	Y
515	00:33:23	00:33:24	Really compromised the trace.	N
516	00:33:25	00:33:28	That's it? A compromised wad of hair?	N
517	00:33:28	00:33:30	No, uh, I called you to discuss the bleach.	N
518	00:33:30	00:33:33	The hairy wad smelled a bit woodsy to me.	N
519	00:33:33	00:33:37	Which is odd, considering it should only smell like bleach.	N
520	00:33:37	00:33:39	You sniffed it?	N
521	00:33:39	00:33:40	That disgust you?	N
522	00:33:41	00:33:43	No, actually, it's the first time you've ever done anything to impress me.	N
523	00:33:43	00:33:48	Anyway, um, I analyzed the bleach.	N
524	00:33:48	00:33:50	It contains a cedar additive.	N
525	00:33:50	00:33:52	Thought you'd want to know.	N
526	00:33:52	00:33:53	Thanks, David.	N
527	00:33:53	00:33:54	Sure, Gil.	N
528	00:33:59	00:34:01	I'm more than happy to help you in any way I can.	Y
529	00:34:01	00:34:04	So when I got your phone call about the scent of our bleach.	Y
530	00:34:04	00:34:06	I figured you should to talk to Lucy.	Y
531	00:34:06	00:34:08	Lucy is our head of housekeeping.	Y
532	00:34:09	00:34:13	The guests sometimes complained about the bleach smell after we cleaned the bathrooms.	N
533	00:34:13	00:34:16	A few years ago, I started adding cedar chips to the bottles.	N
534	00:34:16	00:34:19	Makes it smell better.	N
535	00:34:19	00:34:21	Lucy, who else has access to your bleach?	N
536	00:34:21	00:34:23	Just the maids.	N
537	00:34:23	00:34:24	Are they all female?	N
538	00:34:24	00:34:25	Yes.	N
539	00:34:25	00:34:30	You park your carts in the hallway when you clean the room, so anyone could have swiped a bottle of bleach, right?	N
540	00:34:30	00:34:38	No. We've had problems with theft, towels mainly, but now our maids take their carts into the rooms.	N
541	00:34:38	00:34:40	Those your kids?	Y
542	00:34:40	00:34:42	Yeah.	N
543	00:34:42	00:34:44	Two eldest are at UNLV.	N
544	00:34:44	00:34:46	And the baby? Jake.	N
545	00:34:46	00:34:48	Jake is, uh, six months old.	N
546	00:34:50	00:34:51	Is that your second wife?	Y
547	00:34:51	00:34:52	Mm-hmm.	N
548	00:34:52	00:34:56	So you must have had your vasectomy reversed.	Y
549	00:34:56	00:35:01	Why are we talking about my vasectomy?	Y
550	00:35:01	00:35:05	You also have access to the bleach, so you won't mind if I take a DNA sample.	Y
551	00:35:05	00:35:09	Look.	N
552	00:35:09	00:35:19	If word leaks out that you took my DNA and I'm a murder suspect, I will never work in hospitality again.	Y
553	00:35:19	00:35:21	I'm sorry, the answer's no.	N
554	00:35:21	00:35:23	Anything else?	N
555	00:35:23	00:35:25	We'll be in touch.	N
556	00:35:25	00:35:27	So we've got three suspects, three scenarios.	N
557	00:35:27	00:35:31	Yeah, Matt could have worn his Dad's sweater when he killed Ty.	Y
558	00:35:31	00:35:35	Dumped it in the park during the night, where Walter found it.	N
559	00:35:35	00:35:38	Or Dad could have worn it and dumped it in the park.	N
560	00:35:38	00:35:47	Or this sweater could have accidentally been left in the park, and Walter, the homeless guy, could have picked it up and worn it when he entered the house through the screen door and killed Ty.	N
561	00:35:47	00:35:49	But none of the evidence goes to motive.	N
562	00:35:49	00:35:50	Not our problem at the moment.	N
563	00:35:51	00:35:52	Let's just stay focused on the sweater.	N
564	00:35:52	00:35:56	It's tied to the victim and this scene.	N
565	00:35:56	00:35:58	We need to tie it to the killer.	Y
566	00:35:58	00:36:00	Hey, how tall would you say Matt Hawkins?	Y
567	00:36:00	00:36:04	About five feet, why?	N
568	00:36:04	00:36:05	Dad is... 6'2.	N
569	00:36:05	00:36:07	What about Walter?	N
570	00:36:07	00:36:10	Mmm... 5'10. About Nick's height.	N
571	00:36:10	00:36:11	What you getting at?	N
572	00:36:11	00:36:14	Meet me in the garage in half an hour.	N
573	00:36:17	00:36:26	Mr. Michaels, in my work over the last 25 years, I've come to understand the kind of person who's a rapist-killer.	Y
574	00:36:26	00:36:27	Is that an accusation?	N
575	00:36:27	00:36:30	Well, a woman was murdered in your client's hotel.	Y
576	00:36:30	00:36:32	He has a right to hear our theory.	Y
577	00:36:32	00:36:35	The killer is clearly a psychopath.	Y
578	00:36:35	00:36:37	He's killed more than once.	Y
579	00:36:37	00:36:43	I'm sure that before his first rape and murder he fantasized about it for years.	Y
580	00:36:47	00:36:49	Quiet! Quiet!	N
581	00:36:51	00:36:55	During that time, he engaged in behavioral tryouts.	Y
582	00:36:55	00:37:03	Stalking women and attempting to coerce them sexually, each time moving closer and closer to the actual event.	N
583	00:37:03	00:37:06	( crying ) Shut up!	N
584	00:37:09	00:37:18	I believe that after you consummated your first attack, you felt excitement greater than you anticipated.	Y
585	00:37:18	00:37:21	Your only regret was that she died too quickly.	Y
586	00:37:27	00:37:31	But you took solace in the knowledge that, uh, you could do it again.	Y
587	00:37:31	00:37:38	In fact, your subsequent victim had similar characteristics to your first victim.	Y
588	00:37:38	00:37:40	No! No! No!	N
589	00:37:40	00:37:43	Shut up! Shut up!	N
590	00:37:49	00:37:51	This is a waste of time.	N
591	00:37:51	00:37:57	You see, what differentiates a psychopath from a heat of the moment killer is forethought.	N
592	00:38:03	00:38:06	And you thought about this for a long time.	Y
593	00:38:06	00:38:11	Thank you for the fascinating seminar, but you have no evidence, so we are free to go.	Y
594	00:38:11	00:38:14	Actually, I have some evidence.	N
595	00:38:15	00:38:17	What is this? What's going on?	N
596	00:38:20	00:38:22	Mr. Michaels?	Y
597	00:38:23	00:38:26	She can't... You can't do that.	N
598	00:38:26	00:38:27	Do what?	N
599	00:38:27	00:38:28	No, I know my rights.	Y
600	00:38:28	00:38:28	Hey, shh.	N
601	00:38:28	00:38:30	The bitch broke into my car.	Y
602	00:38:33	00:38:36	I don't remember seeing a warrant, Ms. Sidle.	N
603	00:38:36	00:38:38	I don't have a warrant.	N
604	00:38:38	00:38:40	I was following a hunch.	N
605	00:38:40	00:38:42	Well, then you just set my client free.	Y
606	00:38:42	00:38:43	On the contrary.	N
607	00:38:43	00:38:47	Western Airlines issues this exact type of wheelie to all its flight attendants.	N
608	00:38:47	00:38:53	Since Martha's wheelie wasn't in the hotel room, we thought maybe the killer took it...	Y
609	00:38:53	00:38:55	as a souvenir.	N
610	00:38:55	00:38:57	This particular suit case...	N
611	00:39:01	00:39:05	...is not Martha's wheelie.	N
612	00:39:05	00:39:15	And now that we know where to find it, and we have your client on tape, I bet you we'll get a warrant.	Y
613	00:39:15	00:39:17	Thank you.	Y
614	00:39:21	00:39:29	Okay, Warrick, you are approximately the height of Martin Hawkins.	N
615	00:39:29	00:39:35	Nick, you and the homeless dude are about the same, and Judy, you're close to Matt.	Y
616	00:39:35	00:39:43	The table is the same height as Ty's bed-- 43 and half inches from the floor to the top of the mattress.	N
617	00:39:43	00:39:49	The white sweaters, which you all look so adorable in, are the same fabric as the bloody one.	N
618	00:39:49	00:39:58	The pipes are the same diameter as the wounds on Ty's face.	N
619	00:39:58	00:40:04	I want each of you to take a whack at our victim.	N
620	00:40:04	00:40:05	Just like Chuckie Cheese.	N
621	00:40:05	00:40:06	Whack-a-Mole.	N
622	00:40:07	00:40:09	Uh, spatter up.	N
623	00:41:08	00:41:13	Judy, your sweater-- killer.	Y
624	00:41:13	00:41:17	Like I told him, I did it.	Y
625	00:41:17	00:41:21	You want a medal for figuring out what I already said?	Y
626	00:41:21	00:41:24	You never told me why.	Y
627	00:41:24	00:41:26	Why's it matter, anyways?	N
628	00:41:33	00:41:35	Go ahead.	N
629	00:41:46	00:41:49	Dad.	N
630	00:41:49	00:41:52	I want to know why.	N
631	00:41:52	00:41:53	Dad... Why?	N
632	00:41:54	00:41:55	Damn it.	N
633	00:41:55	00:41:59	Ty looked up to you.	Y
634	00:41:59	00:42:03	He... he loved you.	Y
635	00:42:03	00:42:07	He told. He told everyone!	N
636	00:42:10	00:42:11	That you wet the bed?	Y
637	00:42:11	00:42:13	Shut up!	N
638	00:42:24	00:42:28	Dad... I'm sorry. I...	Y
639	00:42:46	00:42:47	Oh, Matthew...	Y
640	00:42:52	00:42:53	Hey.	N
641	00:42:55	00:42:57	You owe me an apology.	N
642	00:42:57	00:43:00	I'm sorry...	N
643	00:43:01	00:43:03	that you feel that way.	N
