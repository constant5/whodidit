134	134	134	00:11:00	00:11:04	I asked Mia to compare it with the semen from the recent attack.	N
135	135	135	00:11:04	00:11:06	Is that fingerprint from your crime scene?	N
136	136	136	00:11:06	00:11:12	Only print we found. Impressed in Sue's blood on the bedspread near her hips.	N

141	141	141	00:11:24	00:11:28	The crime lab is going to dust your house for prints, so I need to know which ones are yours.	N
142	142	142	00:11:28	00:11:32	Now, your wife said that you both went to bed after the news.	N
143	143	143	00:11:32	00:11:33	I already told you that.	N
144	144	144	00:11:33	00:11:34	Twice.	N

155	155	155	00:12:17	00:12:19	I'll be needing to take your shoes.	N

157	157	157	00:12:22	00:12:23	What now?	N
158	158	158	00:12:23	00:12:25	You and your wife are free to go.	N
159	159	159	00:12:25	00:12:27	What about Matt?	N
160	160	160	00:12:27	00:12:32	He has to stay here in protective custody until this is resolved.	N

165	165	165	00:12:47	00:12:48	It's just procedure.	N
166	166	166	00:12:48	00:12:50	Right? Right.	N
167	167	167	00:12:50	00:12:51	Can we at least speak to him?	N
168	168	168	00:12:51	00:12:53	Can't allow that.	N
169	169	169	00:12:59	00:13:01	Come on, let-let's go.	N
170	170	170	00:13:01	00:13:02	Come on.	N
171	171	171	00:13:09	00:13:10	You just gonna let them go?	N
172	172	172	00:13:10	00:13:12	Neither has a record, no motive.	N
173	173	173	00:13:12	00:13:13	There's no blood on them.	N
174	174	174	00:13:13	00:13:15	Well, they could've showered, tossed their clothes.	N
175	175	175	00:13:15	00:13:17	Their grief is not an act.	N
176	176	176	00:13:17	00:13:18	Yeah, based on what?	N
177	177	177	00:13:18	00:13:20	Years of listening to the parents of dead children.	N
178	178	178	00:13:22	00:13:24	Let's go talk to this kid.	N
179	179	179	00:13:26	00:13:27	Hey, Mia.	N
180	180	180	00:13:33	00:13:39	Let me guess, you're listening to something classy like Jessica or Ashlee.	N
181	181	181	00:13:46	00:13:47	It's... Jean-Paul Sartre.	N
182	182	182	00:13:48	00:13:49	Huis Clos.	N
183	183	183	00:13:49	00:13:51	No Exit.	N
184	184	184	00:13:51	00:13:53	It loses something in a translation.	N
185	185	185	00:13:53	00:13:55	Oui, oui.	N
186	186	186	00:13:55	00:14:01	The blood from the hairy wad that you found in the drain is consistent with the victim.	N
187	187	187	00:14:01	00:14:03	And what about the semen from Martha's SAE?	N
188	188	188	00:14:03	00:14:06	That's consistent with the DNA from the first attack.	N
189	189	189	00:14:06	00:14:09	You are looking at the same rapist.	N
190	190	190	00:14:09	00:14:10	I want to show you something.	N
191	191	191	00:14:10	00:14:12	Really?	N
192	192	192	00:14:21	00:14:24	This guy's immune system doesn't recognize his own sperm.	N
193	193	193	00:14:24	00:14:26	Antibodies are attacking the little guys.	N
194	194	194	00:14:27	00:14:28	I read about this phenomenon in a forensic journal...	N
195	195	195	00:14:28	00:14:31	November, 2003.	N
196	196	196	00:14:31	00:14:33	Killer had a vasectomy, then had it reversed.	N
197	197	197	00:14:33	00:14:34	Oui, oui.	N
198	198	198	00:14:34	00:14:35	Thanks, Mia.	N
199	199	199	00:14:37	00:14:41	How could a boy have made someone so mad?	N
200	200	200	00:14:41	00:14:43	COD is blunt-force trauma.	N
201	201	201	00:14:43	00:14:44	I counted 14 separate blows.	N
202	202	202	00:14:45	00:14:46	Several more were coinciding.	N
203	203	203	00:14:46	00:14:49	Cylindrical weapon, about an inch in diameter.	N
204	204	204	00:14:49	00:14:51	Consistent with a pipe?	N
205	205	205	00:14:51	00:14:54	Yeah. In fact, check this out.	N
206	206	206	00:14:54	00:14:58	Thread pattern's consistent with the end of a pipe.	N
207	207	207	00:15:01	00:15:03	He's got no defense wounds.	N
208	208	208	00:15:04	00:15:07	Yeah. My guess, he never woke up.	N
209	209	209	00:15:09	00:15:11	You're not fooling me, kid.	N
210	210	210	00:15:11	00:15:15	The second I laid eyes on you, I knew how it went down.	N
211	211	211	00:15:15	00:15:25	You took a pipe from the backyard, you went into Ty's bedroom, and while he was sleeping, you beat his brains to a pulp.	N
212	212	212	00:15:25	00:15:28	Now, what the hell's wrong with you, kid?	N
213	213	213	00:15:28	00:15:30	Your little brother is dead.	N
214	214	214	00:15:30	00:15:33	What did he ever do to you?	N
215	215	215	00:15:33	00:15:35	Now, don't look at him. He can't help you.	N
216	216	216	00:15:35	00:15:38	Nobody can help you. You're going to prison.	N
217	217	217	00:15:38	00:15:43	At 14, that means life.	N
218	218	218	00:15:43	00:15:44	I'm talking to you, you little...!	N
219	219	219	00:15:45	00:15:45	Detective...	N
220	220	220	00:15:45	00:15:50	can I have a word with you outside, please?	N
221	221	221	00:15:57	00:16:02	We don't have enough evidence to suggest that that boy killed his brother.	N
222	222	222	00:16:02	00:16:05	What are you getting at?	N
223	223	223	00:16:05	00:16:07	I'm saying I'm not sure if threatening him is the right tactic right now.	N
224	224	224	00:16:07	00:16:08	I found no blood on his clothes.	N
225	225	225	00:16:09	00:16:11	The screen door could have been the point of entry.	N
226	226	226	00:16:11	00:16:17	I mean, have you considered asking him what he heard or-or saw before you just put the full court press on him?	N
227	227	227	00:16:17	00:16:19	I don't tell you how to collect the evidence.	N
228	228	228	00:16:19	00:16:22	No, you don't. Look, there's no disrespect here, okay?	N
229	229	229	00:16:22	00:16:23	We're all on the same team.	N
230	230	230	00:16:23	00:16:27	Then get to the lab and get me something that I can use.	N
231	231	231	00:16:32	00:16:34	Hey.	N
232	232	232	00:16:34	00:16:39	Hey. Call me a geek, but background subtraction application software is the bomb.	N
233	233	233	00:16:39	00:16:41	Only geeks still say the bomb.	N
234	234	234	00:16:41	00:16:45	But it you ask me, geeks should be revered.	N
235	235	235	00:16:45	00:16:49	Okay. Um, the technology's pretty new.	N
236	236	236	00:16:49	00:16:52	You'll get hammered on cross, but it definitely works.	N
237	237	237	00:16:52	00:16:53	Okay, check it out.	N
238	238	238	00:16:53	00:17:03	So the fingerprint is blood-red-- that's the shade we use for the color identifier-- and now the preprogrammed algorithm is just removing all the other colors from the fabric, and we're left with just the print. It's...	N
239	239	239	00:17:03	00:17:04	Mind if I watch?	N
240	240	240	00:17:04	00:17:07	Voyeur, huh?	N
241	241	241	00:17:07	00:17:08	I like that.	N
242	242	242	00:17:08	00:17:08	Geek.	N
243	243	243	00:17:12	00:17:14	Wow. Yeah.	N
244	244	244	00:17:15	00:17:17	Right. ( taps keys )	N
245	245	245	00:17:17	00:17:21	Scan this into I-AFIS, and here we go.	N
246	246	246	00:17:27	00:17:30	Got yourself a hit.	N
247	247	247	00:17:30	00:17:32	Jesse Acheson. 38.	N
248	248	248	00:17:32	00:17:35	Multiple convictions, cocaine possession, intent to sell.	N
249	249	249	00:17:35	00:17:39	In and out of prison for the past... seven years.	N
250	250	250	00:17:39	00:17:41	Was he in or out on May 12, 1999?	N
251	251	251	00:17:41	00:17:43	Out.	N
252	252	252	00:17:43	00:17:44	What about last night?	N
253	253	253	00:17:44	00:17:46	Released six months ago. Living in Henderson.	N
254	254	254	00:17:47	00:17:48	Geeks rule.	N
255	255	255	00:17:54	00:17:56	Who is it?	N
256	256	256	00:17:56	00:17:57	Las Vegas Police.	N
257	257	257	00:18:00	00:18:03	We're looking for Jesse Acheson.	N
258	258	258	00:18:03	00:18:10	Hey, look, my husband hasn't used since he got out of the joint, so whatever you think he did, you're wrong.	N
259	259	259	00:18:10	00:18:11	Do you know where he is?	N
260	260	260	00:18:11	00:18:13	No idea.	N
261	261	261	00:18:13	00:18:16	Well, your marriage is just full of romance, huh?	N
262	262	262	00:18:16	00:18:18	May we come in?	N
263	263	263	00:18:18	00:18:19	Nah, I don't think so.	N
264	264	264	00:18:19	00:18:20	Just one more question.	N
265	265	265	00:18:20	00:18:22	Do you happen to know where he was last night?	N
266	266	266	00:18:22	00:18:25	No. I, uh, I haven't seen him in days.	N
267	267	267	00:18:26	00:18:27	Thank you.	N
268	268	268	00:18:28	00:18:30	That was fun.	N
269	269	269	00:18:32	00:18:37	Brass, you guys get in your cars, drive around the block.	N
270	270	270	00:18:37	00:18:38	Pick me up in five minutes.	N
271	271	271	00:18:38	00:18:40	We'll be close.	N
272	272	272	00:18:49	00:18:51	Jesse, cops were just here.	N
273	273	273	00:18:51	00:18:52	What the hell's going on?	N
274	274	274	00:18:54	00:18:56	No, I didn't tell them where you are!	N
275	275	275	00:18:56	00:18:57	I don't know where the hell you are!	N
276	276	276	00:18:57	00:18:59	When are you coming home?	N
277	277	277	00:18:59	00:19:01	Jesse...	N
278	278	278	00:19:01	00:19:02	Damn you!	N
279	279	279	00:20:03	00:20:10	The shoe impression outside Ty's window matches the brother's Yeah, I got a hair off of Ty's T-shirt.	N
280	280	280	00:20:10	00:20:12	Also consistent with Matt.	N
281	281	281	00:20:12	00:20:16	Either of which could be related to the murder or just a result of two brothers living together.	N
282	282	282	00:20:16	00:20:18	Yeah. What's in the bindle?	N
283	283	283	00:20:18	00:20:19	Uh, Blue fibers.	N
284	284	284	00:20:19	00:20:21	Got them off the vic's T-shirt.	N
285	285	285	00:20:21	00:20:24	Nobody in the family was wearing anything blue.	N
286	286	286	00:20:24	00:20:27	No, but you know, could be from a blanket, a carpet, towel.	N
287	287	287	00:20:27	00:20:29	I'll take them to Trace.	N
288	288	288	00:20:29	00:20:34	Hey, I am concerned that Detective Cavaliere's moving ahead of Forensics on this one.	N
289	289	289	00:20:34	00:20:36	He can move as fast as wants.	N
290	290	290	00:20:36	00:20:38	The D.A. won't file without the physical evidence.	N
291	291	291	00:20:38	00:20:41	Right now, we got nothing.	N
292	292	292	00:20:41	00:20:45	03 p.m. today.	N
293	293	293	00:20:45	00:20:49	I secured a 2703-D court order for the number she was calling.	N
294	294	294	00:20:49	00:20:51	It was a cell phone.	N
295	295	295	00:20:51	00:20:56	I contacted the cell phone company and found out that Jesse answered his phone near Tower 8, phase West.	N
296	296	296	00:20:56	00:21:01	Given the signal strength, he was within two blocks of the tower.	N
297	297	297	00:21:01	00:21:08	His wife said that she hasn't seen him in several days, so I had Homicide check registration at all the hotels within the yellow area.	N
298	298	298	00:21:08	00:21:12	He is booked at the Tangiers.	N
299	299	299	00:21:12	00:21:14	Well done.	N
300	300	300	00:21:14	00:21:19	Get this-- the rapist's semen came back positive for cocaine.	N
301	301	301	00:21:19	00:21:22	We don't usually run a panel for semen, Greg.	N
302	302	302	00:21:22	00:21:27	I know that, but given our suspect's priors for blow, I had a tech run an immunoassay specific to the drug.	N
303	303	303	00:21:27	00:21:31	Wow. You guys are rendering me obsolete.	N
304	304	304	00:21:32	00:21:37	So, Jesse gets coked up, he commits the crime, he drives down to the Strip and he checks into the Tangiers.	N
305	305	305	00:21:37	00:21:38	The Gift Show's in town.	N
306	306	306	00:21:38	00:21:40	There aren't any vacancies on the Strip.	N
307	307	307	00:21:40	00:21:43	Well, his wife said that she hadn't seen him in a few days.	N
308	308	308	00:21:43	00:21:49	Maybe he's back in the game again, selling coke to out-of-town businessmen from the comfort and security of his hotel room.	N
309	309	309	00:21:49	00:21:56	So, he takes a break from his job, rapes and kills the vic at another hotel, and then goes back to work?	N
310	310	310	00:21:56	00:21:59	Even cokeheads need a diversion now and then.	N
311	311	311	00:22:01	00:22:03	Hi, Stokes. Solve the case?	N
312	312	312	00:22:03	00:22:05	I'm getting there.	N
313	313	313	00:22:05	00:22:07	Nothing definitive as of yet.	N
314	314	314	00:22:07	00:22:10	Which means you can't hold Matt Hawkins for longer than his 24 hours.	N
315	315	315	00:22:10	00:22:12	Really? Well, you know, uh...	N
316	316	316	00:22:12	00:22:14	I got a signed confession.	N
317	317	317	00:22:14	00:22:16	Really? Mm-hmm.	N
318	318	318	00:22:16	00:22:19	Sort of kicks the crap out of your evidence, now, doesn't it?	N
319	319	319	00:22:19	00:22:20	He confessed? Signed. Check it.	N
320	320	320	00:22:21	00:22:22	Did you beat it out of him?	N
321	321	321	00:22:22	00:22:25	No, I used science, kind of like you guys.	N
322	322	322	00:22:25	00:22:26	Mm, how's that?	N
323	323	323	00:22:26	00:22:28	I put him on a Computer Voice Stress Analyzer.	N
324	324	324	00:22:28	00:22:31	Once I caught him lying, he gave it right up.	N
325	325	325	00:22:31	00:22:34	That device has been discredited for years.	N
326	326	326	00:22:34	00:22:36	Well, check their Web site.	N
327	327	327	00:22:36	00:22:39	It's still used in 1,400 state and local agencies.	N
328	328	328	00:22:39	00:22:40	Well, not in Las Vegas.	N
329	329	329	00:22:41	00:22:42	Or anywhere else in this state.	N
330	330	330	00:22:42	00:22:48	Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession?	N
331	331	331	00:22:48	00:22:49	He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.	N
332	332	332	00:22:50	00:22:54	Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.	N
333	333	333	00:22:54	00:22:56	He tell you why he did it?	N
334	334	334	00:22:56	00:22:58	No, but he will.	N
335	335	335	00:22:58	00:23:03	Hey, listen, Stokes, thanks for trying to help, but we got him.	N
336	336	336	00:23:04	00:23:06	Okay.	N
337	337	337	00:23:08	00:23:10	So, I just got back from the Tangiers.	N
338	338	338	00:23:10	00:23:15	The GM won't let us into Jesse Acheson's room without a search warrant, and the judge denied our request.	N
339	339	339	00:23:16	00:23:17	I'll talk to the judge.	N
340	340	340	00:23:17	00:23:19	I'll bring Acheson in for questioning, I guess.	N
341	341	341	00:23:19	00:23:23	Could you just keep him under surveillance for now, let Greg tag along with your guy?	N
342	342	342	00:23:23	00:23:24	We might learn something.	N
343	343	343	00:23:24	00:23:27	Sure, I'll get him a bag of donuts.	N
344	344	344	00:23:27	00:23:30	I was testifying today.	N
345	345	345	00:23:30	00:23:31	I ran into the D.A.	N
346	346	346	00:23:31	00:23:34	He filled me in on your case.	N
347	347	347	00:23:34	00:23:38	Looks like Matt Hawkins' confession is gonna stand up in court.	N
348	348	348	00:23:38	00:23:44	Suspects are tricked into confessing all the time, but I'm telling you, Cavaliere intimidated that boy.	N
349	349	349	00:23:44	00:23:46	Man, he would've signed anything.	N
350	350	350	00:23:46	00:23:47	So you think he's innocent?	N
351	351	351	00:23:48	00:23:51	Could be. I checked the crime stats for the Hawkins neighborhood.	N
352	352	352	00:23:51	00:23:53	There's been a rash of nuisance calls.	N
353	353	353	00:23:53	00:23:57	There's some homeless guy running around out there peeping in windows, urinating in public, attempted B and E.	N
354	354	354	00:23:58	00:23:59	Sounds like a suspect.	N
355	355	355	00:23:59	00:24:03	I'm gonna go back out there, see if the Hawkins know anything about it.	N
356	356	356	00:24:03	00:24:05	Need some help?	N
357	357	357	00:24:05	00:24:06	You got that kind of time?	N
358	358	358	00:24:06	00:24:08	I'll meet you in the car.	N
359	359	359	00:24:08	00:24:09	Thanks, Warrick.	N
360	360	360	00:24:09	00:24:17	You expect me to invade Mr. Acheson's privacy based upon a five-year-old fingerprint that was manipulated on a computer?	N
361	361	361	00:24:17	00:24:19	It wasn't manipulated-- it was processed.	N
362	362	362	00:24:19	00:24:23	That's what we do. Try getting that one past a defense attorney.	N
363	363	363	00:24:23	00:24:27	It's one thing to send a print through AFIS; it's another thing to use...	N
364	364	364	00:24:27	00:24:46	a background subtraction algorithm to isolate the print from a bedspread. It's not my fault that the courts lag behind our technology. Gil, I'm sympathetic to your request, but if I grant a warrant based upon this print, and the print is later thrown out of court, then everything you find as a result of it would be excluded, and your pattern rapist could be back on the street.	N
365	365	365	00:24:46	00:24:51	Give me something else-- I'll be happy to grant you a warrant. Your Honor, I need the warrant in order to find something else.	N
366	366	366	00:24:51	00:24:54	You'll find another way.	N
367	367	367	00:25:02	00:25:04	Kind of like bird-watching, ain't it?	N
368	368	368	00:25:04	00:25:06	I wouldn't know.	N
369	369	369	00:25:06	00:25:08	You bored?	N
370	370	370	00:25:08	00:25:10	I'm bored.	N
371	371	371	00:25:12	00:25:14	So, I got a question.	N
372	372	372	00:25:14	00:25:16	I hear the killer completely wiped down the crime scene.	N
373	373	373	00:25:16	00:25:19	So why do you think he left his semen behind?	N
374	374	374	00:25:19	00:25:20	Could've worn a condom.	N
375	375	375	00:25:20	00:25:29	Well, before committing a crime, a typical serial rapist will often masturbate to his perfect rape-murder fantasy.	N
376	376	376	00:25:29	00:25:35	Didn't wear a condom then, didn't want to wear one during the act.	N
377	377	377	00:25:35	00:25:36	Besides, the DNA isn't on file.	N
378	378	378	00:25:36	00:25:38	It wasn't much of a risk.	N
379	379	379	00:25:44	00:25:45	Litterbug.	N
380	380	380	00:25:45	00:25:49	CSIs don't mind the bugs.	N
381	381	381	00:25:52	00:25:58	If the DNA on this cup matches the seminal DNA, Grissom won't need a warrant.	N
382	382	382	00:25:58	00:26:00	We'll be making an arrest.	N
383	383	383	00:26:04	00:26:06	We're not unfit parents.	N
384	384	384	00:26:06	00:26:09	Please, we just want to speak with our son.	N
385	385	385	00:26:09	00:26:13	We called the detective, but no one will tell us anything.	N
386	386	386	00:26:13	00:26:16	Right now your son's under investigation.	N
387	387	387	00:26:17	00:26:22	What? Yeah, the detective asked him if he wanted a parent or advocate present at the interrogation.	N
388	388	388	00:26:22	00:26:25	He's 14 years old, so it's his right to say no.	N
389	389	389	00:26:25	00:26:27	But he's just a kid.	N
390	390	390	00:26:27	00:26:28	I mean, he just lost his brother.	N
391	391	391	00:26:29	00:26:30	Matt's sensitive.	N
392	392	392	00:26:30	00:26:31	He doesn't handle stress well.	N
393	393	393	00:26:31	00:26:33	If we-we-we could just talk to him.	N
394	394	394	00:26:33	00:26:35	He may need a change of clothes.	N
395	395	395	00:26:36	00:26:38	Were those his clothes in the washer?	N
396	396	396	00:26:38	00:26:40	Yeah.	N
397	397	397	00:26:40	00:26:46	Okay, we'll see what we can do about getting him something to wear. In the meantime, if you could just answer the question.	N
398	398	398	00:26:46	00:26:49	You want to know about that homeless guy?	N
399	399	399	00:26:50	00:26:51	Yeah. He's nuts.	N
400	400	400	00:26:51	00:26:54	He-he scared the boys once or twice, but...	N
401	401	401	00:26:54	00:26:55	How did he scare them?	N
402	402	402	00:26:55	00:26:57	Ty saw him writing something on the window.	N
403	403	403	00:26:57	00:26:58	Was it Brat?	N
404	404	404	00:26:59	00:26:59	Yeah.	N
405	405	405	00:27:00	00:27:01	I chased him away.	N
406	406	406	00:27:02	00:27:03	Matt...	N
407	407	407	00:27:03	00:27:04	cleaned off the window.	N
408	408	408	00:27:04	00:27:07	That would explain the shoe impressions outside the bedroom window.	N
409	409	409	00:27:07	00:27:10	You're thinking that that guy had something to do with what happened?	N
410	410	410	00:27:10	00:27:12	Well, that's what we're trying to find out.	N
411	411	411	00:27:12	00:27:15	Oh, God. I knew we should've called the cops.	N
412	412	412	00:27:15	00:27:16	When was the last time that you saw him?	N
413	413	413	00:27:17	00:27:18	I jog through that park every evening.	N
414	414	414	00:27:19	00:27:22	Um, he's got this, uh...	N
415	415	415	00:27:22	00:27:27	makeshift tent thing set up by the playground.	N
416	416	416	00:27:34	00:27:37	What? Hey! Stop it! Come on!	N
417	417	417	00:27:37	00:27:38	Get up! Let me... let me go!	N
418	418	418	00:27:38	00:27:41	Let go of me! Stop it!	N
419	419	419	00:27:42	00:27:43	Hey, what's your name? What?	N
420	420	420	00:27:43	00:27:45	Tell the gentlemen your name.	N
421	421	421	00:27:45	00:27:48	Walter! My name is Walter!	N
422	422	422	00:27:48	00:27:50	Walter, that's a nice blue sweater.	N
423	423	423	00:27:50	00:27:51	Where'd you get it?	N
424	424	424	00:27:51	00:27:53	What? I said I like your sweater-- where'd you get it?	N
425	425	425	00:27:53	00:27:55	It's mine! Oh, it's yours?	N
426	426	426	00:27:55	00:27:57	Yes, this is my sweater!	N
427	427	427	00:27:57	00:27:58	Whose blood is it on your sweater, Walter?	N
428	428	428	00:27:58	00:28:01	We're gonna give you a nice warm place to sleep tonight, partner.	N
429	429	429	00:28:01	00:28:03	Suspicion of murder.	N
430	430	430	00:28:03	00:28:05	No! No!	N
431	431	431	00:28:05	00:28:08	( screaming ) Easy with the sweater.	N
432	432	432	00:28:08	00:28:10	It's evidence.	N
433	433	433	00:28:10	00:28:20	So, I processed the DNA from the coffee cup, and it turns out that there were two contributions on the lip, which means that your coffee shop recycles, and not in the good way.	N
434	434	434	00:28:20	00:28:21	Gross.	N
435	435	435	00:28:21	00:28:27	Bad news is that neither of the contributions is consistent with the semen that was recovered from the crime scene.	N
436	436	436	00:28:27	00:28:32	If Acheson didn't rape Sue Stein, what is his print doing on the bedspread?	N
437	437	437	00:28:32	00:28:35	Well, I certainly didn't kill anyone, and...	N
438	438	438	00:28:35	00:28:37	I do not know how my fingerprint got there.	N
439	439	439	00:28:37	00:28:40	We don't think that you did rape or kill anyone.	N
440	440	440	00:28:40	00:28:45	We simply want to know how your fingerprint ended up at a murder scene five years ago.	N
441	441	441	00:28:45	00:28:57	Look, Jesse, we appreciate you coming down here voluntarily, but if you clam up, we're gonna have to file an obstruction of justice charge, and that's not good... for you.	N
442	442	442	00:28:57	00:28:59	Let's make it easy on yourself.	N
443	443	443	00:29:01	00:29:04	What were you doing in Sue Stein's hotel room?	N
444	444	444	00:29:06	00:29:08	You won't believe me.	N
445	445	445	00:29:08	00:29:10	Try us.	N
446	446	446	00:29:12	00:29:15	I did go to see Sue that night.	N
447	447	447	00:29:15	00:29:17	Sue.	N
448	448	448	00:29:18	00:29:19	Come on, girl, wake up.	N
449	449	449	00:29:27	00:29:29	You just took off?	N
450	450	450	00:29:29	00:29:32	You didn't bother to report a murder?	N
451	451	451	00:29:32	00:29:37	Ma'am, I... I got a record, and I was on probation.	N
452	452	452	00:29:37	00:29:40	If I'd done all of that, I'd have been...	N
453	453	453	00:29:40	00:29:42	suspect numero uno.	N
454	454	454	00:29:42	00:29:43	All right, let's cut to the chase.	N
455	455	455	00:29:43	00:29:46	You were there to sell her blow, right?	N
456	456	456	00:29:50	00:29:52	I don't need a lawyer, right?	N
457	457	457	00:29:52	00:29:53	I mean, it's off the record?	N
458	458	458	00:29:54	00:29:56	We're just having a little chat here.	N
459	459	459	00:29:59	00:30:02	That's why she left the door unlocked.	N
460	460	460	00:30:02	00:30:05	We'd been doing it that way for years.	N
461	461	461	00:30:05	00:30:10	Whenever Sue came to town, I always took care of her.	N
462	462	462	00:30:14	00:30:17	I'm really sorry.	N
463	463	463	00:30:18	00:30:21	She was my friend.	N
464	464	464	00:30:21	00:30:24	I wish I could be more help.	N
465	465	465	00:30:27	00:30:29	Stokes. Hey, man.	N
466	466	466	00:30:29	00:30:31	What the hell are you doing?	N
467	467	467	00:30:31	00:30:35	Are you trying to screw with my case? I'm just following the evidence, and it led me to another suspect.	N
468	468	468	00:30:35	00:30:38	I think you're gonna want to talk to him in the interest of justice.	N
469	469	469	00:30:38	00:30:40	What, are you trying to help the defense now?	N
470	470	470	00:30:40	00:30:44	You know any good defense is gonna bring up a rush to judgment here. Come on!	N
471	471	471	00:30:44	00:30:46	Chris, you put another interviewed suspect on your list.	N
472	472	472	00:30:46	00:30:48	It shows due diligence.	N
473	473	473	00:30:48	00:30:50	Let's go.	N
474	474	474	00:30:53	00:30:55	Your sweater's been analyzed, Walter.	N
475	475	475	00:30:55	00:30:58	Found bloodstains from a murdered boy on it.	N
476	476	476	00:30:58	00:31:00	It's not my sweater.	N
477	477	477	00:31:00	00:31:03	You already told me it was yours.	N
478	478	478	00:31:03	00:31:05	Finders keepers.	N
479	479	479	00:31:05	00:31:07	It wasn't always mine, though.	N
480	480	480	00:31:07	00:31:10	Where did you find it? On a bench.	N
481	481	481	00:31:10	00:31:12	By the basketball courts.	N
482	482	482	00:31:18	00:31:20	I was cold.	N
483	483	483	00:31:20	00:31:21	Hey, man...	N
484	484	484	00:31:21	00:31:24	if you're lying...	N
485	485	485	00:31:24	00:31:25	I'm not lying.	N
486	486	486	00:31:27	00:31:28	I'm not lying!	N
487	487	487	00:31:28	00:31:30	So when did you find it?	N
488	488	488	00:31:31	00:31:32	Yesterday.	N
489	489	489	00:31:32	00:31:34	No, um, a few days ago.	N
490	490	490	00:31:36	00:31:38	I don't remember.	N
491	491	491	00:31:38	00:31:40	Put him in lockup-- maybe it'll help his memory.	N
492	492	492	00:31:47	00:31:49	Stokes...	N
493	493	493	00:31:49	00:31:51	I got a signed confession.	N
494	494	494	00:31:51	00:31:53	You got a bum in a bloody sweater.	N
495	495	495	00:31:53	00:31:56	What are you gonna do about it?	N
496	496	496	00:32:28	00:32:29	Hey, Catherine. Yeah?	N
497	497	497	00:32:29	00:32:31	DNA finished up with the blue sweater and I processed it.	N
498	498	498	00:32:32	00:32:32	Anything probative?	N
499	499	499	00:32:33	00:32:37	I ran it under the UV light and out popped one of those invisible dry cleaner ID stamps, you know?	N
500	500	500	00:32:37	00:32:38	Yeah?	N
501	501	501	00:32:38	00:32:41	I called the dry cleaner, they gave me a name.	N
502	502	502	00:32:41	00:32:44	Mr. Hawkins, is that your sweater?	N
503	503	503	00:32:47	00:32:48	Yeah...	N
504	504	504	00:32:48	00:32:49	it looks like my sweater.	N
505	505	505	00:32:49	00:32:50	Where'd you find it?	N
506	506	506	00:32:50	00:32:52	Did you give it away?	N
507	507	507	00:32:52	00:32:55	No, but I haven't seen it n a while, though. Why?	N
508	508	508	00:32:55	00:32:58	It's got Ty's blood on it.	N
509	509	509	00:33:01	00:33:04	Do I need a lawyer?	N
510	510	510	00:33:04	00:33:06	That's your call, sir.	N
511	511	511	00:33:13	00:33:14	You called me?	N
512	512	512	00:33:14	00:33:18	Yeah, Mia sent me that wad of hair that you pulled out of the hotel drain.	N
513	513	513	00:33:18	00:33:20	It's coated in bleach.	N
514	514	514	00:33:20	00:33:23	I'm thinking the killer must've poured the stuff down the drain.	N
515	515	515	00:33:23	00:33:24	Really compromised the trace.	N
516	516	516	00:33:25	00:33:28	That's it? A compromised wad of hair?	N
517	517	517	00:33:28	00:33:30	No, uh, I called you to discuss the bleach.	N
518	518	518	00:33:30	00:33:33	The hairy wad smelled a bit woodsy to me.	N
519	519	519	00:33:33	00:33:37	Which is odd, considering it should only smell like bleach.	N
520	520	520	00:33:37	00:33:39	You sniffed it?	N
521	521	521	00:33:39	00:33:40	That disgust you?	N
522	522	522	00:33:41	00:33:43	No, actually, it's the first time you've ever done anything to impress me.	N
523	523	523	00:33:43	00:33:48	Anyway, um, I analyzed the bleach.	N
524	524	524	00:33:48	00:33:50	It contains a cedar additive.	N
525	525	525	00:33:50	00:33:52	Thought you'd want to know.	N
526	526	526	00:33:52	00:33:53	Thanks, David.	N
527	527	527	00:33:53	00:33:54	Sure, Gil.	N
528	528	528	00:33:59	00:34:01	I'm more than happy to help you in any way I can.	N
529	529	529	00:34:01	00:34:04	So when I got your phone call about the scent of our bleach.	N
530	530	530	00:34:04	00:34:06	I figured you should to talk to Lucy.	N
531	531	531	00:34:06	00:34:08	Lucy is our head of housekeeping.	N
532	532	532	00:34:09	00:34:13	The guests sometimes complained about the bleach smell after we cleaned the bathrooms.	N
533	533	533	00:34:13	00:34:16	A few years ago, I started adding cedar chips to the bottles.	N
534	534	534	00:34:16	00:34:19	Makes it smell better.	N
535	535	535	00:34:19	00:34:21	Lucy, who else has access to your bleach?	N
536	536	536	00:34:21	00:34:23	Just the maids.	N
537	537	537	00:34:23	00:34:24	Are they all female?	N
538	538	538	00:34:24	00:34:25	Yes.	N
539	539	539	00:34:25	00:34:30	You park your carts in the hallway when you clean the room, so anyone could have swiped a bottle of bleach, right?	N
540	540	540	00:34:30	00:34:38	No. We've had problems with theft, towels mainly, but now our maids take their carts into the rooms.	N
541	541	541	00:34:38	00:34:40	Those your kids?	N
542	542	542	00:34:40	00:34:42	Yeah.	N
543	543	543	00:34:42	00:34:44	Two eldest are at UNLV.	N
544	544	544	00:34:44	00:34:46	And the baby? Jake.	N
545	545	545	00:34:46	00:34:48	Jake is, uh, six months old.	N
546	546	546	00:34:50	00:34:51	Is that your second wife?	N
547	547	547	00:34:51	00:34:52	Mm-hmm.	N
548	548	548	00:34:52	00:34:56	So you must have had your vasectomy reversed.	N
549	549	549	00:34:56	00:35:01	Why are we talking about my vasectomy?	N
550	550	550	00:35:01	00:35:05	You also have access to the bleach, so you won't mind if I take a DNA sample.	N
551	551	551	00:35:05	00:35:09	Look.	N
552	552	552	00:35:09	00:35:19	If word leaks out that you took my DNA and I'm a murder suspect, I will never work in hospitality again.	N
553	553	553	00:35:19	00:35:21	I'm sorry, the answer's no.	N
554	554	554	00:35:21	00:35:23	Anything else?	N
555	555	555	00:35:23	00:35:25	We'll be in touch.	N
556	556	556	00:35:25	00:35:27	So we've got three suspects, three scenarios.	N
557	557	557	00:35:27	00:35:31	Yeah, Matt could have worn his Dad's sweater when he killed Ty.	N
558	558	558	00:35:31	00:35:35	Dumped it in the park during the night, where Walter found it.	N
559	559	559	00:35:35	00:35:38	Or Dad could have worn it and dumped it in the park.	N
560	560	560	00:35:38	00:35:47	Or this sweater could have accidentally been left in the park, and Walter, the homeless guy, could have picked it up and worn it when he entered the house through the screen door and killed Ty.	N
561	561	561	00:35:47	00:35:49	But none of the evidence goes to motive.	N
562	562	562	00:35:49	00:35:50	Not our problem at the moment.	N
563	563	563	00:35:51	00:35:52	Let's just stay focused on the sweater.	N
564	564	564	00:35:52	00:35:56	It's tied to the victim and this scene.	N
565	565	565	00:35:56	00:35:58	We need to tie it to the killer.	N
566	566	566	00:35:58	00:36:00	Hey, how tall would you say Matt Hawkins?	N
567	567	567	00:36:00	00:36:04	About five feet, why?	N
568	568	568	00:36:04	00:36:05	Dad is... 6'2.	N
569	569	569	00:36:05	00:36:07	What about Walter?	N
570	570	570	00:36:07	00:36:10	Mmm... 5'10. About Nick's height.	N
571	571	571	00:36:10	00:36:11	What you getting at?	N
572	572	572	00:36:11	00:36:14	Meet me in the garage in half an hour.	N
573	573	573	00:36:17	00:36:26	Mr. Michaels, in my work over the last 25 years, I've come to understand the kind of person who's a rapist-killer.	N
574	574	574	00:36:26	00:36:27	Is that an accusation?	N
575	575	575	00:36:27	00:36:30	Well, a woman was murdered in your client's hotel.	N
576	576	576	00:36:30	00:36:32	He has a right to hear our theory.	N
577	577	577	00:36:32	00:36:35	The killer is clearly a psychopath.	N
578	578	578	00:36:35	00:36:37	He's killed more than once.	N
579	579	579	00:36:37	00:36:43	I'm sure that before his first rape and murder he fantasized about it for years.	N
580	580	580	00:36:47	00:36:49	Quiet! Quiet!	N
581	581	581	00:36:51	00:36:55	During that time, he engaged in behavioral tryouts.	N
582	582	582	00:36:55	00:37:03	Stalking women and attempting to coerce them sexually, each time moving closer and closer to the actual event.	N
583	583	583	00:37:03	00:37:06	( crying ) Shut up!	N
584	584	584	00:37:09	00:37:18	I believe that after you consummated your first attack, you felt excitement greater than you anticipated.	N
585	585	585	00:37:18	00:37:21	Your only regret was that she died too quickly.	N
586	586	586	00:37:27	00:37:31	But you took solace in the knowledge that, uh, you could do it again.	N
587	587	587	00:37:31	00:37:38	In fact, your subsequent victim had similar characteristics to your first victim.	N
588	588	588	00:37:38	00:37:40	No! No! No!	N
589	589	589	00:37:40	00:37:43	Shut up! Shut up!	N
590	590	590	00:37:49	00:37:51	This is a waste of time.	N
591	591	591	00:37:51	00:37:57	You see, what differentiates a psychopath from a heat of the moment killer is forethought.	N
592	592	592	00:38:03	00:38:06	And you thought about this for a long time.	N
593	593	593	00:38:06	00:38:11	Thank you for the fascinating seminar, but you have no evidence, so we are free to go.	N
594	594	594	00:38:11	00:38:14	Actually, I have some evidence.	N
595	595	595	00:38:15	00:38:17	What is this? What's going on?	N
596	596	596	00:38:20	00:38:22	Mr. Michaels?	N
597	597	597	00:38:23	00:38:26	She can't... You can't do that.	N
598	598	598	00:38:26	00:38:27	Do what?	N
599	599	599	00:38:27	00:38:28	No, I know my rights.	N
600	600	600	00:38:28	00:38:28	Hey, shh.	N
601	601	601	00:38:28	00:38:30	The bitch broke into my car.	N
602	602	602	00:38:33	00:38:36	I don't remember seeing a warrant, Ms. Sidle.	N
603	603	603	00:38:36	00:38:38	I don't have a warrant.	N
604	604	604	00:38:38	00:38:40	I was following a hunch.	N
605	605	605	00:38:40	00:38:42	Well, then you just set my client free.	N
606	606	606	00:38:42	00:38:43	On the contrary.	N
607	607	607	00:38:43	00:38:47	Western Airlines issues this exact type of wheelie to all its flight attendants.	N
608	608	608	00:38:47	00:38:53	Since Martha's wheelie wasn't in the hotel room, we thought maybe the killer took it...	N
609	609	609	00:38:53	00:38:55	as a souvenir.	N
610	610	610	00:38:55	00:38:57	This particular suit case...	N
611	611	611	00:39:01	00:39:05	...is not Martha's wheelie.	N
612	612	612	00:39:05	00:39:15	And now that we know where to find it, and we have your client on tape, I bet you we'll get a warrant.	N
613	613	613	00:39:15	00:39:17	Thank you.	N
614	614	614	00:39:21	00:39:29	Okay, Warrick, you are approximately the height of Martin Hawkins.	N
615	615	615	00:39:29	00:39:35	Nick, you and the homeless dude are about the same, and Judy, you're close to Matt.	N
616	616	616	00:39:35	00:39:43	The table is the same height as Ty's bed-- 43 and half inches from the floor to the top of the mattress.	N
617	617	617	00:39:43	00:39:49	The white sweaters, which you all look so adorable in, are the same fabric as the bloody one.	N
618	618	618	00:39:49	00:39:58	The pipes are the same diameter as the wounds on Ty's face.	N
619	619	619	00:39:58	00:40:04	I want each of you to take a whack at our victim.	N
620	620	620	00:40:04	00:40:05	Just like Chuckie Cheese.	N
621	621	621	00:40:05	00:40:06	Whack-a-Mole.	N
622	622	622	00:40:07	00:40:09	Uh, spatter up.	N
623	623	623	00:41:08	00:41:13	Judy, your sweater-- killer.	N
624	624	624	00:41:13	00:41:17	Like I told him, I did it.	N
625	625	625	00:41:17	00:41:21	You want a medal for figuring out what I already said?	N
626	626	626	00:41:21	00:41:24	You never told me why.	N
627	627	627	00:41:24	00:41:26	Why's it matter, anyways?	N
628	628	628	00:41:33	00:41:35	Go ahead.	N
629	629	629	00:41:46	00:41:49	Dad.	N
630	630	630	00:41:49	00:41:52	I want to know why.	N
631	631	631	00:41:52	00:41:53	Dad... Why?	N
632	632	632	00:41:54	00:41:55	Damn it.	N
633	633	633	00:41:55	00:41:59	Ty looked up to you.	N
634	634	634	00:41:59	00:42:03	He... he loved you.	N
635	635	635	00:42:03	00:42:07	He told. He told everyone!	N
636	636	636	00:42:10	00:42:11	That you wet the bed?	N
637	637	637	00:42:11	00:42:13	Shut up!	N
638	638	638	00:42:24	00:42:28	Dad... I'm sorry. I...	N
639	639	639	00:42:46	00:42:47	Oh, Matthew...	N
640	640	640	00:42:52	00:42:53	Hey.	N
641	641	641	00:42:55	00:42:57	You owe me an apology.	N
642	642	642	00:42:57	00:43:00	I'm sorry...	N
643	643	643	00:43:01	00:43:03	that you feel that way.	N
