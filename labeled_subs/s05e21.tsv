0	00:00:25	00:00:26	Hey, Danny.	N
1	00:00:31	00:00:32	Thanks.	N
2	00:01:14	00:01:15	Some night, huh?	N
3	00:01:16	00:01:17	It's ugly out there.	N
4	00:02:10	00:02:15	the criminally insane and sexually violent predators, all with multiple convictions.	N
5	00:02:15	00:02:18	We get all the inmates the prisons can't handle.	N
6	00:02:18	00:02:22	Keep your kits closed and locked when not in use.	N
7	00:02:22	00:02:23	Um, Ms. Sidle, best if you remove the vest.	N
8	00:02:23	00:02:27	New uniforms upset them.	N
9	00:02:32	00:02:38	We're mostly concerned with maintaining psychiatric remission.	N
10	00:02:38	00:02:45	We want to stabilize symptoms and reduce an individual's risk of violence to himself and to others.	N
11	00:02:45	00:02:50	Oh, uh, could actually stop here and put your backs against the wall, please.	N
12	00:02:50	00:02:52	It's standard safety procedure.	N
13	00:03:01	00:03:04	Put your tongue in your mouth, Jake.	N
14	00:03:04	00:03:05	We're moving them all to the Day Room.	Y
15	00:03:12	00:03:13	This is Captain Brass.	N
16	00:03:14	00:03:18	Dr. Grissom and Ms. Sidle are from the Crime Lab.	N
17	00:03:18	00:03:19	Lt. Reed Owens, Desert State Hospital Police.	N
18	00:03:19	00:03:25	We have our own internal police team and Lieutenant Owens was the first officer on the scene after the call came in.	Y
19	00:03:25	00:03:28	The victim was found by Nurse Faber 10 a.m.	N
20	00:03:28	00:03:31	Joanne was coming off shift, I was coming on.	N
21	00:03:31	00:03:34	Doing bed checks, I found Robbie on the floor.	N
22	00:03:34	00:03:37	Kenny was in the corner covered in blood.	N
23	00:03:37	00:03:39	Are the patients locked in their rooms at night?	N
24	00:03:39	00:03:41	No. The doors are left unlocked.	N
25	00:03:41	00:03:44	So they're free to roam around?	N
26	00:03:44	00:03:48	Locked rooms usually lead to patients trying to harm themselves.	N
27	00:03:48	00:03:49	Where's Kenny now?	N
28	00:03:49	00:03:51	He's been taken to seclusion.	N
29	00:03:55	00:03:58	Shh-shh-shh.	N
30	00:03:58	00:04:02	Leon, let's get a couple more milligrams of Lorazepam into him.	N
31	00:04:04	00:04:06	How did he get those wounds?	N
32	00:04:06	00:04:07	Oh, Kenny's a self-mutilator.	N
33	00:04:07	00:04:10	He suffers from Renfield's Syndrome; gets off on blood.	N
34	00:04:10	00:04:11	Shh...	N
35	00:04:11	00:04:17	Couple of weeks ago I caught him gouging himself with a carpet staple.	N
36	00:04:17	00:04:20	He was wearing these clothes when you found him?	N
37	00:04:20	00:04:21	Yes.	N
38	00:04:27	00:04:30	There was blood spatter all over the victim's room.	N
39	00:04:31	00:04:33	Blood but no spatter on Kenny's clothes.	N
40	00:04:33	00:04:35	I'm not sure this is our guy.	N
41	00:04:35	00:04:38	Locked unit. Finite number of suspects.	N
42	00:04:41	00:04:45	Crazy or not... here we come.	N
43	00:05:31	00:05:34	Who's this guy knitting an imaginary sweater?	N
44	00:05:34	00:05:36	How's he know when it's finished?	N
45	00:05:36	00:05:38	His brain tells him that what he's doing is real.	N
46	00:05:38	00:05:40	He has no reason to doubt it.	N
47	00:05:40	00:05:42	Or any desire to.	N
48	00:05:42	00:05:46	They asked John Nash how he could believe that extraterrestrials were sending him messages.	N
49	00:05:46	00:05:52	He said that the messages came to him in the same way that his mathematical ideas did.	N
50	00:05:52	00:05:54	So he had to take them seriously.	N
51	00:05:54	00:05:56	Hey. Valerie Dino.	N
52	00:05:56	00:05:57	I'm the on-call doctor.	N
53	00:05:58	00:05:59	Did you pronounce?	N
54	00:05:59	00:06:00	Yeah.	N
55	00:06:00	00:06:05	The administration asked me to set up some rooms for your interviews, but, uh, personally, I don't see what you hope to accomplish.	N
56	00:06:05	00:06:08	These patients are criminals with severe mental disorders.	N
57	00:06:08	00:06:10	They're not going to give you a straight answer.	N
58	00:06:11	00:06:12	No one ever does.	N
59	00:07:13	00:07:15	I definitely heard something.	N
60	00:07:15	00:07:16	He said, I'll get in!	N
61	00:07:16	00:07:22	No, no, it was, I'm coming in.	N
62	00:07:22	00:07:23	I heard him say it.	N
63	00:07:23	00:07:24	And it's not like he isn't serious.	N
64	00:07:28	00:07:30	Who isn't serious?	N
65	00:07:30	00:07:32	The, uh, perpetrator.	N
66	00:07:35	00:07:38	Can you tell me anything else about him?	N
67	00:07:38	00:07:40	Oh, no, I couldn't.	N
68	00:07:40	00:07:42	Why not?	N
69	00:07:42	00:07:44	He's here.	N
70	00:07:47	00:07:48	In this room?	N
71	00:07:50	00:07:53	Is his name Ronald?	N
72	00:07:53	00:07:55	No. My name is Ronald.	N
73	00:07:56	00:07:57	What's his name?	N
74	00:07:57	00:07:59	He doesn't have a name.	N
75	00:07:59	00:08:01	He's a cricket.	N
76	00:08:01	00:08:03	Here.	N
77	00:08:03	00:08:04	A cricket?	N
78	00:08:05	00:08:06	Yes.	N
79	00:08:06	00:08:09	Trying to burrow a hole in my head.	N
80	00:08:15	00:08:16	I don't sleep.	N
81	00:08:18	00:08:20	Never?	N
82	00:08:23	00:08:25	So what do you do at night?	N
83	00:08:25	00:08:28	Day, night, it don't make no difference.	N
84	00:08:28	00:08:29	I think.	N
85	00:08:32	00:08:33	About what?	N
86	00:08:35	00:08:36	Bitches.	N
87	00:09:18	00:09:20	What's so amusing?	N
88	00:09:20	00:09:25	So let's say you find out who did it, and maybe it's me.	N
89	00:09:27	00:09:30	What are you going to do?	N
90	00:09:30	00:09:33	Are you going to convict me of murder and put me in a bad place?	N
91	00:09:33	00:09:36	Is it you?	N
92	00:09:36	00:09:37	Check the files, sir.	N
93	00:09:37	00:09:40	I'm a rapist, not a murderer.	N
94	00:09:44	00:09:47	Robert Garson?	N
95	00:09:48	00:09:49	Hmm?	N
96	00:09:54	00:09:57	Do you know what happened to Robert Garson?	N
97	00:09:57	00:10:05	Female pig relation hanged, it sped even, well, too.	N
98	00:10:06	00:10:07	What?	N
99	00:10:09	00:10:16	No. I ground it... blindly.	N
100	00:10:16	00:10:17	Wet and dirty.	N
101	00:10:17	00:10:19	Cut the blood oven.	N
102	00:10:19	00:10:23	It spoke justly, repeatedly, calmly.	N
103	00:10:23	00:10:26	Some thin rod dared your wash.	N
104	00:10:26	00:10:32	They foretold this into some ready child, which fell crossly.	N
105	00:10:32	00:10:36	They hag-rode me... again.	N
106	00:10:38	00:10:40	Why are you looking at me?	N
107	00:10:40	00:10:42	You got Leon, he's a spic.	N
108	00:10:42	00:10:44	Earl, the brother.	N
109	00:10:44	00:10:48	And the crazy frickin' jewboy with the bug in his head.	N
110	00:10:52	00:10:55	You know, most of the doctors here are Jewish.	N
111	00:10:55	00:10:57	They're the ones with the access.	N
112	00:11:03	00:11:04	Yeah?	N
113	00:11:05	00:11:07	Dr. Dino.	N
114	00:11:07	00:11:08	Hi.	N
115	00:11:08	00:11:11	Paperwork.	N
116	00:11:11	00:11:13	This is a state-run facility.	N
117	00:11:13	00:11:14	What can I help you with?	N
118	00:11:14	00:11:17	Question about the victim.	N
119	00:11:17	00:11:24	I have heard that in some cases of deviant sexual predisposition, you slow the sex drive...	N
120	00:11:24	00:11:28	If you're talking about chemical castration, the answer is, yes, Robbie was.	N
121	00:11:28	00:11:31	So he didn't masturbate.	N
122	00:11:31	00:11:32	Masturbate, yes.	N
123	00:11:32	00:11:34	Ejaculate, no.	N
124	00:11:34	00:11:37	So the semen that I found on his bed is someone else's?	N
125	00:11:37	00:11:39	Likely.	N
126	00:11:39	00:11:41	Thanks.	N
127	00:11:41	00:11:43	Sure.	N
128	00:11:43	00:11:48	Hey, guys, I found semen in the victim's room and it's probably not his.	N
129	00:11:48	00:11:50	He was chemically castrated.	N
130	00:11:50	00:11:53	So you're thinking the donor could be the killer?	N
131	00:11:53	00:11:58	Sex is the foreplay. Violence is the climax.	N
132	00:11:59	00:12:01	Well... happy swabbing.	N
133	00:12:03	00:12:04	They've been prepped.	N
134	00:12:05	00:12:07	You're all set.	N
135	00:12:07	00:12:08	Thank you, Lieutenant.	N
136	00:12:08	00:12:10	Here you go, padre.	N
137	00:12:10	00:12:12	Wash your worries away.	N
138	00:12:12	00:12:14	Thank you.	N
139	00:12:16	00:12:18	Well, you take that side.	N
140	00:12:21	00:12:22	I'll take Jiminy Cricket.	N
141	00:12:22	00:12:24	Excellent.	N
142	00:12:31	00:12:32	Say ah.	N
143	00:12:32	00:12:33	Ah.	N
144	00:12:35	00:12:36	Thank you.	N
145	00:12:40	00:12:42	Say ah.	N
146	00:12:46	00:12:47	You, too, Leon.	N
147	00:12:47	00:12:48	I work here.	N
148	00:12:48	00:12:50	Exactly.	N
149	00:12:53	00:12:54	Open your mouth, please.	N
150	00:12:56	00:12:57	Would you open your mouth, sir?	N
151	00:13:02	00:13:05	Grissom...	N
152	00:13:05	00:13:07	you take this one.	N
153	00:13:14	00:13:16	Let's start with the stomach contents.	N
154	00:13:16	00:13:18	They're fascinating.	N
155	00:13:18	00:13:22	It reminded me of that scene in Jaws where Dreyfuss cuts open the shark's belly and all kinds of weird things come out.	N
156	00:13:22	00:13:25	You find a license plate?	N
157	00:13:25	00:13:27	Not quite.	N
158	00:13:27	00:13:32	Highlights include Band-Aids, wood chips, hair and half a snapshot.	N
159	00:13:32	00:13:34	Pica?	N
160	00:13:34	00:13:35	Boo?	N
161	00:13:37	00:13:41	Pica is a compulsion to eat non-nutritive food items.	N
162	00:13:41	00:13:45	It's from the Latin word for magpie, a bird with a large and indiscriminate appetite.	N
163	00:13:45	00:13:51	Trichotillomania would explain the pulling out and eating of hair.	N
164	00:13:51	00:13:53	Another OCD disorder.	N
165	00:13:53	00:13:56	I sent hair and blood samples to Tox.	N
166	00:13:56	00:13:58	Stellate lacerations.	N
167	00:13:58	00:14:01	Linear skull fracture extending into the calvarium.	N
168	00:14:01	00:14:04	And contre-coup contusions to the frontal and temporal lobes.	N
169	00:14:04	00:14:07	So C.O.D. was blunt force trauma?	N
170	00:14:07	00:14:08	No. Asphyxiation.	N
171	00:14:08	00:14:10	During the struggle?	N
172	00:14:10	00:14:17	No. Coagulation of the blood tells me that the head trauma was post-mortem, at least two hours after he was suffocated.	N
173	00:14:17	00:14:20	So evidently dead wasn't dead enough.	N
174	00:14:20	00:14:26	I also found ligature marks on the wrists and ankles.	N
175	00:14:26	00:14:29	They showed up during the Y, peri-mortem.	N
176	00:14:29	00:14:32	So, what, tortured? Tied up?	N
177	00:14:32	00:14:34	Restrained.	N
178	00:14:39	00:14:41	Nobody mentioned restraints.	N
179	00:14:45	00:14:47	Would you ever bleach your hair?	N
180	00:14:47	00:14:48	I wouldn't.	N
181	00:14:48	00:14:50	It's so Greg Sanders.	N
182	00:14:50	00:14:55	Most of the hair is the vic's, but I also found that bleached sample as well.	N
183	00:14:55	00:15:00	In my continuing quest to further my standing, I took it upon myself to get you the tox report.	N
184	00:15:00	00:15:01	Thanks. You're welcome.	N
185	00:15:01	00:15:04	Blood came back with pretty hefty levels of Olanzapine.	N
186	00:15:04	00:15:06	That's a potent anti-psychotic.	N
187	00:15:06	00:15:07	Good for drooling.	N
188	00:15:07	00:15:12	And also there's the, uh, not so potent smattering of Ibuprofen.	N
189	00:15:12	00:15:13	That's it? That's it.	N
190	00:15:14	00:15:19	If I were institutionalized, I think I would hope for something better.	N
191	00:15:19	00:15:21	Clonazepam, maybe.	Y
192	00:15:21	00:15:24	What, you, uh, think I'm crazy?	Y
193	00:15:24	00:15:26	Crazy is as crazy does.	N
194	00:15:26	00:15:30	His chart indicated at least four other anti-psychotics.	Y
195	00:15:30	00:15:32	Why wasn't he getting those meds?	N
196	00:15:32	00:15:35	Do I look clairvoyant?	Y
197	00:15:35	00:15:37	News flash from the loony bin.	Y
198	00:15:37	00:15:43	Two reported deaths in the last three years from complications due to restraint procedures.	Y
199	00:15:43	00:15:45	And how many have gone unreported?	N
200	00:15:45	00:15:47	The hospital just got off probation.	N
201	00:15:47	00:15:49	One more death by restraint brings the Feds in.	N
202	00:15:49	00:15:51	Good incentive to keep it quiet.	N
203	00:15:51	00:15:53	Or make it look like someone else did it.	N
204	00:15:53	00:15:56	Yeah. Somebody who's crazy.	N
205	00:15:56	00:15:58	We're legally required to tape all our sessions.	Y
206	00:15:58	00:16:03	This is Robbie in the seclusion room the day he died.	N
207	00:16:13	00:16:17	As you can see, the on-call doctor and Nurse Mckay checked in on him.	N
208	00:16:19	00:16:24	Two hours later, he was escorted out, so I resent the accusation.	N
209	00:16:24	00:16:27	We've made a lot of changes.	N
210	00:16:27	00:16:30	Policy, staff, surveillance have all been overhauled.	N
211	00:16:30	00:16:34	Look, Robbie left the seclusion room alive.	N
212	00:16:34	00:16:35	Okay, fine.	N
213	00:16:35	00:16:37	Who administers medication?	N
214	00:16:37	00:16:38	Uh, the nurses, psych techs.	N
215	00:16:39	00:16:40	Why is this important?	N
216	00:16:40	00:16:44	Well, according to his tox results, Robbie's system was short four anti-psychotics.	N
217	00:16:44	00:16:46	Maybe he was cheeking them.	N
218	00:16:56	00:16:57	Why would he do that?	N
219	00:16:57	00:16:59	They think they don't need 'em.	N
220	00:16:59	00:17:00	They sell 'em, trade 'em or...	N
221	00:17:00	00:17:02	store them up, get high later.	N
222	00:17:02	00:17:05	We're gonna need to talk to his pharmacist.	N
223	00:17:06	00:17:08	Who's next? Oh, come on, Earl.	N
224	00:17:08	00:17:09	There you go.	N
225	00:17:12	00:17:15	Hey, you know I'm gonna bust your ass on the court, right?	N
226	00:17:15	00:17:17	You better bring your 'A' game next time.	N
227	00:17:17	00:17:19	Come on, Chuck, I got something for you.	N
228	00:17:28	00:17:30	Love your hair, Leon.	N
229	00:17:30	00:17:31	Thanks.	N
230	00:17:31	00:17:33	What do you got here?	N
231	00:17:33	00:17:37	Ibuprofen, laxative, aspirin.	N
232	00:17:37	00:17:41	What are you treating exactly, schizophrenia or constipation?	N
233	00:17:41	00:17:43	Where are the real drugs, Leon?	N
234	00:17:48	00:18:01	Man... Xanax, Lanzopine, Zoloft, Suprazadone, Clozapine, Loranzapan, lithium, Valium, Wellbutrin, Haldol, Respiredone.	N
235	00:18:01	00:18:04	You took everything with street value.	N
236	00:18:04	00:18:06	Look, dude...	N
237	00:18:06	00:18:08	I get 22K a year.	N
238	00:18:08	00:18:09	That's nothing.	N
239	00:18:09	00:18:11	Diddly-squat.	N
240	00:18:11	00:18:13	I should get hazard pay.	N
241	00:18:13	00:18:15	These people, I get...	N
242	00:18:15	00:18:17	I get spit on, puked on, peed on, bitten.	N
243	00:18:17	00:18:22	I get my hair yanked out, I get my ass pinched, I get... I get death threats.	N
244	00:18:22	00:18:24	All for 22K.	N
245	00:18:24	00:18:26	So I supplement my income.	N
246	00:18:26	00:18:28	It don't hurt nobody.	N
247	00:18:28	00:18:30	Are you a doctor?	N
248	00:18:30	00:18:34	Look, these places, they overmedicate all the time.	N
249	00:18:34	00:18:36	It controls the population.	N
250	00:18:36	00:18:39	And I don't endanger the patients, okay?	N
251	00:18:39	00:18:41	I-I'm all about the patients.	N
252	00:18:41	00:18:45	Maybe Robbie caught you skimping on his meds, threatened to blow the whistle.	N
253	00:18:45	00:18:46	There goes that supplemental income.	N
254	00:18:49	00:18:51	I see what you're doing.	N
255	00:18:51	00:18:54	I'm reporting you. You're stealing.	Y
256	00:18:54	00:18:55	Robbie, hold on a second, will you?	N
257	00:19:01	00:19:05	All right, here you go, here you go, here you go.	N
258	00:19:13	00:19:15	No. All right, no way, man.	N
259	00:19:15	00:19:17	That's a story.	N
260	00:19:17	00:19:19	'Kay? That's not why he went to seclusion.	N
261	00:19:19	00:19:21	Why did he go to seclusion?	N
262	00:19:21	00:19:22	He freaked out in group.	N
263	00:19:23	00:19:24	I wasn't even there.	N
264	00:19:24	00:19:26	Ask somebody who was.	N
265	00:19:27	00:19:29	Am I gonna lose my job?	N
266	00:19:29	00:19:32	'Cause these people...	N
267	00:19:32	00:19:34	need me.	N
268	00:19:34	00:19:39	According to the video logs, 03 p.m.	N
269	00:19:39	00:19:41	06 p.m.	N
270	00:19:41	00:19:47	Nurse Mckay noted that he was awake and in bed 30 p.m. bed-checks.	N
271	00:19:48	00:19:51	10.	Y
272	00:19:51	00:19:54	30 and midnight, he was suffocated.	Y
273	00:19:54	00:19:56	30.	N
274	00:19:56	00:20:00	The blood would've needed time to coagulate before his head was smashed in.	Y
275	00:20:00	00:20:03	And not necessarily by the same person.	Y
276	00:20:03	00:20:05	Hey, how about some pillow talk?	Y
277	00:20:05	00:20:07	Robbie's pillow had saliva on it.	N
278	00:20:07	00:20:09	Lots of it; all his.	N
279	00:20:09	00:20:10	Could be from drooling.	N
280	00:20:11	00:20:13	Or it could be from dying.	N
281	00:20:13	00:20:17	Well, look at this-- I found slits at both ends.	N
282	00:20:17	00:20:18	Left hand...	Y
283	00:20:18	00:20:20	and right hand.	Y
284	00:20:23	00:20:25	Looks like we have a murder weapon.	N
285	00:20:26	00:20:31	All past-level-three patients, please return to your unit for a head count.	N
286	00:20:33	00:20:36	All past-level-three patients, please return to your unit...	N
287	00:20:36	00:20:38	Thanks, Officer.	Y
288	00:20:38	00:20:40	Nurse Mckay, hi.	Y
289	00:20:40	00:20:44	Dr. Dino said that you supervised group therapy yesterday.	Y
290	00:20:45	00:20:49	Uh, yeah. I heard there was an incident involving Robbie.	Y
291	00:20:49	00:20:51	He had a personal item.	Y
292	00:20:51	00:20:53	A personal item?	Y
293	00:20:53	00:20:57	You can't bring anything in group except a beverage.	N
294	00:20:57	00:20:59	It distracts the other patients.	Y
295	00:20:59	00:21:00	What did he bring?	Y
296	00:21:00	00:21:02	A photograph.	N
297	00:21:02	00:21:04	Of what?	Y
298	00:21:04	00:21:07	A little boy.	Y
299	00:21:08	00:21:10	What did you do?	N
300	00:21:10	00:21:13	I followed protocol.	N
301	00:21:13	00:21:14	Anybody else have anything they want to talk about?	N
302	00:21:14	00:21:17	I wanna know why everybody's always staring at me-- especially him.	N
303	00:21:17	00:21:19	He's staring at me.	N
304	00:21:19	00:21:21	I'm not staring at... Hang on, hang on.	N
305	00:21:21	00:21:22	Robbie?	N
306	00:21:23	00:21:26	What have you got there? Nothing.	N
307	00:21:26	00:21:27	Fag candy.	N
308	00:21:27	00:21:28	Well, what's the rule?	N
309	00:21:28	00:21:30	There's no personal items...	N
310	00:21:30	00:21:31	No!	N
311	00:21:31	00:21:32	Give me the... No!	N
312	00:21:32	00:21:33	No! Don't touch me!	N
313	00:21:36	00:21:39	medication, seclusion, restraint.	N
314	00:21:39	00:21:43	Tough love. Call it what you want-- these aren't my children.	N
315	00:21:43	00:21:46	Why didn't you mention this information last night?	N
316	00:21:46	00:21:49	Because crap like that happens every day here.	N
317	00:21:50	00:21:53	I should get back to the unit. Sure.	N
318	00:21:56	00:21:58	Sidle.	N
319	00:21:58	00:22:01	We got the DNA results back on the semen on Robbie's sheets.	N
320	00:22:01	00:22:04	Patient Adam Trent-- the nail biter.	N
321	00:22:04	00:22:05	Okay.	N
322	00:22:13	00:22:15	This stuff is dark.	N
323	00:22:15	00:22:17	Yeah.	N
324	00:22:17	00:22:21	'Course, I wouldn't expect Winnie the Pooh.	N
325	00:22:23	00:22:25	Adam's subconscious was working overtime.	N
326	00:22:25	00:22:29	I bet you aced your Rorschachs.	N
327	00:22:29	00:22:34	When I was in fifth grade, I drew a picture of a harpooned whale.	N
328	00:22:34	00:22:36	Everyone thought I was gonzo'd.	N
329	00:22:36	00:22:38	But I had just read Moby Dick.	N
330	00:22:39	00:22:43	Sometimes a dying whale is just a dying whale.	Y
331	00:23:23	00:23:25	These are all postdated over a year ago.	Y
332	00:23:30	00:23:31	It's not just his subconscious.	N
333	00:23:31	00:23:33	This guy's got stuff buried everywhere.	N
334	00:23:37	00:23:40	Dearest Angel, I think of you wherever I go.	Y
335	00:23:40	00:23:42	You are my prince. I miss you.	N
336	00:23:42	00:23:44	Write to me. Your only love, Mother.	N
337	00:23:44	00:23:46	Another one.	N
338	00:23:46	00:23:48	Uh... It rained today.	N
339	00:23:48	00:23:51	I thought of that time when you and I got caught in the storm at the lake.	N
340	00:23:51	00:23:54	The fire... I came home and made your favorite dinner.	N
341	00:23:54	00:23:55	I even set a place for you...	N
342	00:23:55	00:23:57	So on and so forth.	N
343	00:23:57	00:23:59	That does not sound maternal to me.	N
344	00:23:59	00:24:01	It's not.	N
345	00:24:01	00:24:02	Incest?	N
346	00:24:02	00:24:03	Fully consummated.	N
347	00:24:03	00:24:07	Mother-son incest is rare and deeply pathological.	N
348	00:24:07	00:24:09	Oedipal complex taken too far?	N
349	00:24:09	00:24:10	Oedipus...	N
350	00:24:10	00:24:11	implies son to mother.	N
351	00:24:11	00:24:15	In this case, the mother was seeking the love and creating the codependence.	N
352	00:24:15	00:24:17	We call this a Jocasta complex.	N
353	00:24:17	00:24:19	Oedipus' mother.	N
354	00:24:19	00:24:22	When Adam was nine his father died.	N
355	00:24:22	00:24:24	His mother replaced her dead husband with her son.	N
356	00:24:25	00:24:26	That's got to mess you up.	N
357	00:24:26	00:24:32	Yeah. Adam is schizo-affective, suicidal, and a pathological narcissist.	Y
358	00:24:32	00:24:41	When he was a teenager he was unable to retaliate against his mother and incapable of actual intimacy, so... he started raping woman.	Y
359	00:24:41	00:24:43	Always women?	N
360	00:24:43	00:24:46	Yes. Which is why I don't think he killed Robbie.	N
361	00:24:46	00:24:48	We found Adam's semen in Robbie's bed.	N
362	00:24:48	00:24:50	You see, that surprises me.	Y
363	00:24:50	00:24:54	Like any good psychopath, he rarely veers from his pattern.	N
364	00:24:54	00:24:58	Adam is a single-celled organism who exists wholly for himself.	N
365	00:25:00	00:25:02	He must've been getting something tangible in return.	N
366	00:25:02	00:25:03	What?	N
367	00:25:03	00:25:06	Drugs? Cigarettes?	N
368	00:25:06	00:25:07	Drugs aren't his issue.	N
369	00:25:07	00:25:10	And as far as I know he doesn't smoke. Um...	N
370	00:25:10	00:25:12	So, uh, what can we learn from his art work?	N
371	00:25:12	00:25:22	Uh... He starts with an innocuous object; a tree, a cat, an oboe-- all of which he morphs into something deadly. You can see...	N
372	00:25:23	00:25:25	all of them.	N
373	00:25:25	00:25:29	So what should be safe turns into something unsafe.	N
374	00:25:29	00:25:31	Mother becomes lover.	N
375	00:25:31	00:25:32	What about the mother?	N
376	00:25:32	00:25:34	Do you have any idea where she is?	N
377	00:25:34	00:25:36	She lives near Reno.	N
378	00:25:36	00:25:39	Based on the postmarks, it seems like she stopped writing him.	N
379	00:25:40	00:25:45	Every time a letter came a manic episode followed, then a severe depression, including one suicide attempt.	N
380	00:25:45	00:25:51	So I started sending the letters back.	N
381	00:25:51	00:25:53	Eventually, she stopped writing.	N
382	00:26:00	00:26:03	Did I kill him?	N
383	00:26:03	00:26:06	Yes.	N
384	00:26:06	00:26:07	Why?	N
385	00:26:07	00:26:10	He was queer.	N
386	00:26:10	00:26:12	But you had sex with him.	N
387	00:26:15	00:26:17	No.	N
388	00:26:17	00:26:19	He had sex with me.	N
389	00:26:19	00:26:21	He was the punk.	N
390	00:26:21	00:26:24	Was it consensual?	N
391	00:26:24	00:26:26	I don't know.	N
392	00:26:26	00:26:28	So why did you do it?	N
393	00:26:28	00:26:31	I don't know.	N
394	00:26:31	00:26:33	Okay.	N
395	00:26:34	00:26:36	So then what happened?	N
396	00:26:36	00:26:38	I took his head and I smashed it into the floor.	N
397	00:26:41	00:26:44	And that's how you killed him?	N
398	00:26:48	00:26:50	What? You don't believe me?	N
399	00:26:50	00:26:52	I'm just wondering if that's how you killed him.	N
400	00:26:52	00:26:54	Yes. I'm saying this and this is true.	N
401	00:26:54	00:26:59	And if you don't believe me, just look in the bucket in the latrine.	N
402	00:26:59	00:27:00	Okay...	N
403	00:27:01	00:27:05	Do you really want to know why I killed him?	N
404	00:27:05	00:27:06	Yes.	N
405	00:27:13	00:27:16	It's because I'm crazy.	Y
406	00:27:22	00:27:25	Not a word about suffocation.	N
407	00:27:25	00:27:28	Well, his nails weren't long enough to leave those tears in the pillow.	Y
408	00:27:28	00:27:30	And there would have been traces of blood from his cuticles.	Y
409	00:27:30	00:27:32	Something is off.	N
410	00:27:53	00:27:56	Here's the blood splatter we've been looking for.	N
411	00:28:03	00:28:05	What is that on the crotch?	N
412	00:28:07	00:28:09	Lipstick.	N
413	00:28:20	00:28:21	Where is Nurse Mckay?	N
414	00:28:21	00:28:23	I need to talk to her.	Y
415	00:28:23	00:28:25	She's on lunch duty.	N
416	00:28:25	00:28:32	All right. I can either take this and the underwear back to the lab and confirm the match, which will only extend our presence here.	Y
417	00:28:32	00:28:34	Or...	N
418	00:28:34	00:28:37	you can give me access to the nurse's station right now.	N
419	00:28:40	00:28:43	Dr. Walsh, please call your service.	N
420	00:28:43	00:28:45	Dr. Walsh, call your service, stat.	N
421	00:28:45	00:28:50	This must be the photo that Nurse Mckay confiscated from Robbie in group.	N
422	00:28:50	00:28:52	The missing half?	N
423	00:28:52	00:28:56	I found blue tape in Robbie's room.	N
424	00:28:56	00:28:58	Kind of looks like Adam.	N
425	00:28:58	00:29:00	Where would Robbie get a picture of Adam?	N
426	00:29:00	00:29:03	Well, they were having sex.	N
427	00:29:12	00:29:14	I'm going to find someone who can open these drawers.	N
428	00:29:14	00:29:16	Okay.	N
429	00:29:16	00:29:20	Dr. Stoon, please pick up the white telephone.	Y
430	00:29:20	00:29:23	Dr. Stoon, call on the white telephone.	N
431	00:29:38	00:29:40	Hey.	N
432	00:29:47	00:29:49	Are you a spiritual person?	N
433	00:29:49	00:29:52	Sometimes.	N
434	00:29:52	00:29:56	Do you believe that everything happens for a reason?	Y
435	00:29:56	00:29:59	That bad things are there to teach us a karmic lesson?	N
436	00:29:59	00:30:04	You know, maybe all our problems can be cured by tuning in to a higher frequency.	Y
437	00:30:04	00:30:14	There's this one guy I read, he believes that illness, anxiety and fear all occur when people are vibrating at 10,000 cycles a second.	Y
438	00:30:23	00:30:32	If they could just get up to 100,000 cycles per second they'd be in the realm of sound, light and spirit, and everything would be just fine. Right?	N
439	00:30:32	00:30:33	Yeah.	N
440	00:30:33	00:30:34	You know what I think?	N
441	00:30:34	00:30:38	I think I'm just vibrating at the wrong frequency.	N
442	00:30:38	00:30:39	It's okay.	N
443	00:30:39	00:30:42	Do you think I'm smart?	Y
444	00:30:42	00:30:43	Yeah. Yeah?	Y
445	00:30:43	00:30:44	Uh-huh.	N
446	00:30:44	00:30:46	Do you think I'm right?	N
447	00:30:46	00:30:47	I do. Open the door.	N
448	00:30:47	00:30:49	I can't. I don't have my keys to open the door.	N
449	00:30:49	00:30:51	Don't you move.	N
450	00:30:51	00:30:52	Please open the door.	N
451	00:30:52	00:30:54	You move a muscle I will grind you, bitch.	Y
452	00:30:55	00:30:55	You hear me?	N
453	00:30:55	00:30:56	Do not look at them.	Y
454	00:30:56	00:30:57	Keep your eyes on the floor.	Y
455	00:30:58	00:31:01	You! You, go away! You! You, go away!	Y
456	00:31:01	00:31:02	No!	N
457	00:31:04	00:31:05	Adam, stop!	N
458	00:31:06	00:31:08	Get a medic in here!	Y
459	00:31:08	00:31:09	Hold still.	Y
460	00:31:09	00:31:10	Apple pressure!	N
461	00:31:10	00:31:14	Where is he? Where is he?	N
462	00:31:15	00:31:17	We need some help in here!	Y
463	00:31:29	00:31:34	When my father died, my mother came to a place like this for awhile for evaluation.	N
464	00:31:36	00:31:40	It looked the same, it smelled the same.	N
465	00:31:40	00:31:41	It smelled like lies.	N
466	00:31:43	00:31:45	You sure you're okay?	N
467	00:31:45	00:31:49	Crazy people do make me feel crazy.	N
468	00:31:50	00:31:54	If you want, I can have somebody take your place.	N
469	00:31:54	00:31:57	I appreciate that.	N
470	00:31:57	00:32:00	I do, I really do, but...	N
471	00:32:02	00:32:07	I kind of made a decision to move beyond that and...	Y
472	00:32:07	00:32:09	I really want to finish this case.	N
473	00:32:09	00:32:10	We have rules for a reason.	N
474	00:32:10	00:32:12	You people come in here disrupting things.	Y
475	00:32:12	00:32:15	You're unsafe. This is your fault.	Y
476	00:32:15	00:32:16	Really?	N
477	00:32:17	00:32:19	You seem to take your job rather personally.	Y
478	00:32:19	00:32:20	What are you suggesting?	N
479	00:32:20	00:32:23	That you had an intimate relationship with Adam Trent.	N
480	00:32:23	00:32:25	That's ridiculous.	N
481	00:32:25	00:32:26	Your lipstick is on his underwear.	N
482	00:32:27	00:32:28	I gave Robbie my lipstick sometimes.	N
483	00:32:28	00:32:29	Maybe he was wearing it when...	N
484	00:32:29	00:32:31	We didn't find any on his lips.	N
485	00:32:31	00:32:36	Well, that's your problem.	N
486	00:32:36	00:32:37	What are you waiting for?	N
487	00:32:37	00:32:40	Get him to the medical unit, stat.	N
488	00:33:10	00:33:13	Excuse me.	N
489	00:33:14	00:33:16	Adam Trent was working on this piece?	N
490	00:33:17	00:33:18	Yes.	N
491	00:33:18	00:33:20	He made it on Monday.	N
492	00:33:20	00:33:23	But he never got a chance to fire it.	N
493	00:33:23	00:33:27	Nurse Mckay came in, they had a conversation.	N
494	00:33:27	00:33:31	Actually, it was more of an argument, very heated, very loud.	N
495	00:33:38	00:33:41	And then she yanked him out of class.	N
496	00:33:41	00:33:43	Was this on the wheel while they were arguing?	N
497	00:33:43	00:33:45	Yeah.	N
498	00:33:48	00:33:50	Adam's work is very provocative.	N
499	00:33:50	00:33:52	Yeah.	N
500	00:33:52	00:33:55	It speaks to me.	N
501	00:33:55	00:33:57	Acoustic Archeology?	N
502	00:33:57	00:34:01	In the '60s, experiments were done on clay pots and painted canvas.	N
503	00:34:01	00:34:07	Scientists were able to ferret out sounds that were captured during the creative process in the clay and the paint.	Y
504	00:34:07	00:34:08	Trippy.	N
505	00:34:08	00:34:11	It's actually not that out there.	N
506	00:34:11	00:34:19	In the old days, the first gramophone recordings were made by taking the vibrations of sound and cutting them into wax cylinders while they were turning.	N
507	00:34:22	00:34:29	Based on the frequency and intensity of the sound, the stylus cut into the wax, creating distinct variances of depth and width.	Y
508	00:34:32	00:34:41	For playback, a mechanical transducer vibrated along a groove, generating a current which, when amplified, turned into sound.	Y
509	00:34:41	00:34:48	When the art therapist told me that there'd been an argument while Adam was on the wheel, I thought well, maybe we can pull some sound off his pot.	Y
510	00:34:48	00:34:50	Doppler laser.	Y
511	00:34:50	00:34:51	Optical transducer.	N
512	00:34:51	00:34:53	We've come a long way.	N
513	00:34:53	00:34:54	Baby.	N
514	00:34:58	00:35:01	Well, there's something there.	Y
515	00:35:03	00:35:05	And it sounds like...	N
516	00:35:06	00:35:08	this.	Y
517	00:35:10	00:35:11	It's lousy signal-to-noise.	Y
518	00:35:11	00:35:14	It's going to need a lot of processing.	Y
519	00:35:26	00:35:27	Speech elements skew to consonants.	N
520	00:35:28	00:35:30	I'll try and dig them out.	Y
521	00:35:38	00:35:42	Rrr-bee... Rrr-bee...	Y
522	00:35:42	00:35:43	Robbie?	Y
523	00:35:44	00:35:45	Maybe.	N
524	00:35:45	00:35:48	Could you run that back a little bit?	N
525	00:35:48	00:35:49	Sure.	N
526	00:35:51	00:35:52	What is that?	N
527	00:35:55	00:35:56	Right there.	Y
528	00:35:57	00:36:00	Nnn-gl. Nnn-gl...	Y
529	00:36:00	00:36:02	Angle?	Y
530	00:36:02	00:36:03	Angel.	N
531	00:36:03	00:36:05	...my angel.	Y
532	00:36:05	00:36:07	My angel. My angel.	Y
533	00:36:09	00:36:13	In her letters, Adam's mother called him angel.	Y
534	00:36:18	00:36:22	The hair from the brush in Adam's room was fresh enough to get a DNA profile.	N
535	00:36:22	00:36:23	It came back female.	N
536	00:36:24	00:36:26	We tested it against your cigarette butt.	N
537	00:36:26	00:36:28	It matched.	N
538	00:36:28	00:36:30	Adam liked it when I brushed his hair.	N
539	00:36:30	00:36:32	I bet he did.	Y
540	00:36:32	00:36:36	You were lying about giving Robbie lipstick.	Y
541	00:36:36	00:36:44	You have seven out of 13 alleles in common with your patient, Adam Trent.	Y
542	00:36:44	00:36:47	Your dearest angel.	Y
543	00:36:47	00:36:49	Okay.	Y
544	00:36:49	00:36:53	Joanne Mckay, registered nurse, licensed by the Nevada Board of Nursing 1978.	N
545	00:36:53	00:36:56	Married Howard Trent 1980.	N
546	00:36:56	00:37:00	The board requires you to get a new certificate when you get married.	Y
547	00:37:00	00:37:01	I guess you never complied.	N
548	00:37:01	00:37:03	I've always gone by my maiden name.	Y
549	00:37:03	00:37:07	I guess that makes it less embarrassing to check into the motel with your son.	Y
550	00:37:09	00:37:10	Oh, I'm sorry.	Y
551	00:37:10	00:37:12	You checked into a psycho ward instead.	Y
552	00:37:12	00:37:13	My son needed me.	N
553	00:37:14	00:37:15	For what?	Y
554	00:37:15	00:37:17	To destroy his ego?	Y
555	00:37:17	00:37:19	To fill him with guilt?	N
556	00:37:19	00:37:24	To make him hate himself so much he would take his own life just to be free of you?	Y
557	00:37:24	00:37:28	You have no idea what goes on between us.	Y
558	00:37:28	00:37:30	Let's cut the umbilical cord, okay?	Y
559	00:37:30	00:37:33	Six months ago your letters started to come back.	Y
560	00:37:33	00:37:36	No more communication with little Lord Fauntleroy.	N
561	00:37:36	00:37:38	So you apply to Desert State.	N
562	00:37:38	00:37:41	They were desperate for nursing staff, so you got a job.	Y
563	00:37:41	00:37:44	Gentlemen, this is our new nurse, Nurse Mckay.	Y
564	00:37:44	00:37:49	Hello.	Y
565	00:37:49	00:37:53	Bet it's tough to turn a folie á deux into a menage á trois.	Y
566	00:37:53	00:37:55	N'est-ce pas?	Y
567	00:38:00	00:38:04	Even tougher that your son was cheating on you...	N
568	00:38:04	00:38:07	with a man no less.	N
569	00:38:12	00:38:14	You need to stop this.	N
570	00:38:14	00:38:16	Stop what?	N
571	00:38:16	00:38:18	End it with Robbie.	N
572	00:38:18	00:38:20	Don't tell me what to do.	N
573	00:38:20	00:38:22	End it or I will.	Y
574	00:38:23	00:38:25	But he didn't end it, did he?	N
575	00:38:25	00:38:28	Robbie was lover's leverage.	Y
576	00:38:28	00:38:34	He was that thing that Adam kept in his back pocket and pull out whenever he needed to distance himself from you.	N
577	00:38:34	00:38:37	So you had no choice but to get rid of Robbie.	N
578	00:38:37	00:38:40	And being a good nurse, you knew his trigger.	N
579	00:38:43	00:38:46	I want you to talk about this in group today.	N
580	00:38:46	00:38:47	B-But I thought that we...	N
581	00:38:47	00:38:48	It's okay. You can bring it.	N
582	00:38:50	00:38:52	Hey! Robbie.	Y
583	00:38:53	00:38:54	What do you got there?	Y
584	00:38:55	00:38:57	There's no personal items in group.	Y
585	00:38:57	00:38:58	B-But y-you... you told me...	Y
586	00:38:58	00:38:59	that I could bring this.	Y
587	00:38:59	00:39:01	I didn't say anything. Give me that.	Y
588	00:39:01	00:39:02	What is that, a picture?	Y
589	00:39:02	00:39:04	You remember? Give me the picture.	Y
590	00:39:04	00:39:05	No, do you remember?	N
591	00:39:05	00:39:06	You remember? No! Give me the picture.	N
592	00:39:06	00:39:07	No, you don't tell me!	Y
593	00:39:07	00:39:08	You told me...!	Y
594	00:39:08	00:39:10	( yelling ) Hang on!	N
595	00:39:23	00:39:28	You manipulated the situation and took advantage of his weakness.	N
596	00:39:28	00:39:32	Exactly what you have been doing to Adam for the past 20 years.	N
597	00:39:32	00:39:37	And being such a good mother, you made him cover it up.	N
598	00:39:37	00:39:39	Again.	N
599	00:39:58	00:40:01	Why would my son do that?	N
600	00:40:01	00:40:04	Because he loves you as much as he hates you.	N
601	00:40:07	00:40:09	You can't prove any of this.	N
602	00:40:09	00:40:12	Just the incest, which is a Class B felony.	N
603	00:40:12	00:40:14	It carries a penalty of up to ten years.	N
604	00:40:14	00:40:17	That's ten years away from Adam.	N
605	00:40:17	00:40:21	Good luck getting him to testify.	N
606	00:40:25	00:40:27	Okay.	N
607	00:40:37	00:40:41	Well, jail or no jail, I don't think she'll last six months.	N
608	00:40:41	00:40:45	She'll die without her son.	N
609	00:40:45	00:40:49	That would be better for both of them.	N
