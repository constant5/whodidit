0	0	0	00:00:32	00:00:33	Officer...	N
1	1	1	00:00:33	00:00:35	thank God you're here.	N
2	2	2	00:00:35	00:00:36	You know why I stopped you?	N
3	3	3	00:00:36	00:00:38	Yeah, I... I... I was speeding, uh...	N
4	4	4	00:00:38	00:00:41	of course, but you have to understand, you see, someone is chasing me.	N
5	5	5	00:00:43	00:00:44	You see, I have videos.	N
6	6	6	00:00:44	00:00:45	I bet you do.	N
7	7	7	00:00:45	00:00:47	Let's start with license and registration.	N
8	8	8	00:00:49	00:00:53	Officer, if I could... if I could just show you.	N
9	9	9	00:01:11	00:01:13	Found a camcorder.	N
10	10	10	00:01:13	00:01:15	No tape inside.	N
11	11	11	00:01:21	00:01:23	Not much traffic.	N
12	12	12	00:01:23	00:01:26	Makes it a lot easier to run someone off the road...	N
13	13	13	00:01:26	00:01:28	...and slash their throat.	N
14	14	14	00:01:28	00:01:32	She was slashed south of the border, as well.	N
15	15	15	00:01:34	00:01:39	Women in convertibles are low-hanging fruit.	N
16	16	16	00:01:39	00:01:41	And it was a top-down night.	N
17	17	17	00:01:45	00:01:49	and TOYOTA. Choose any direction, as long as it's moving forward.	N
18	18	18	00:02:27	00:02:28	That's a nice ring.	N
19	19	19	00:02:29	00:02:31	It's at least four carats.	N
20	20	20	00:02:32	00:02:34	We've been shopping.	N
21	21	21	00:02:38	00:02:42	artificial breasts, cheek implants...	N
22	22	22	00:02:42	00:02:44	collagen lips...	N
23	23	23	00:02:44	00:02:47	You'd be surprised how many women I get on this table with fake parts.	N
24	24	24	00:02:47	00:02:50	Plastic lasts longer.	N
25	25	25	00:03:08	00:03:16	Wow. Mascara, tweezers... under-eye cream...	N
26	26	26	00:03:17	00:03:20	...neck-firming lotion. Girls.	N
27	27	27	00:03:20	00:03:22	Pads...	N
28	28	28	00:03:22	00:03:28	One, two, three, four jars of depilatory cream?	N
29	29	29	00:03:28	00:03:30	That's a lot of bikini wax.	N
30	30	30	00:03:30	00:03:31	Some girls hate the nether-stubble.	N
31	31	31	00:03:32	00:03:34	Nether-stubble?	N
32	32	32	00:03:39	00:03:41	Swipe card.	N
33	33	33	00:03:41	00:03:42	Entertainment Department, Tangiers.	N
34	34	34	00:03:47	00:03:49	Well...	N
35	35	35	00:03:49	00:03:51	Walter Clancy didn't mind stubble.	N
36	36	36	00:03:52	00:03:53	Who's Walter?	N
37	37	37	00:03:53	00:03:56	The registered owner of this vehicle.	N
38	38	38	00:03:56	00:03:58	So she either borrowed this car...	N
39	39	39	00:03:59	00:04:00	or she stole it.	N
40	40	40	00:04:01	00:04:04	Genital wounds were more profound than I expected.	N
41	41	41	00:04:04	00:04:06	Profound how?	N
42	42	42	00:04:06	00:04:08	Well, I was looking for ovaries and I found a prostate.	N
43	43	43	00:04:10	00:04:11	She was a he?	N
44	44	44	00:04:11	00:04:15	She had genital reassignment surgery.	N
45	45	45	00:04:15	00:04:16	And what does that mean exactly?	N
46	46	46	00:04:16	00:04:18	Exactly?	N
47	47	47	00:04:18	00:04:22	Her testicles were removed and her penis was inverted, creating a vagina.	N
48	48	48	00:04:23	00:04:25	And, evidently, the killer kept subtracting.	N
49	49	49	00:04:25	00:04:27	Subtracting what?	N
50	50	50	00:04:27	00:04:29	Well, they don't call it an Adam's apple for nothing.	N
51	51	51	00:04:29	00:04:34	A man with issues might become upset if he found one on his woman.	N
52	52	52	00:04:34	00:04:35	Cause?	N
53	53	53	00:04:35	00:04:38	Severed carotid and jugular complex.	N
54	54	54	00:04:38	00:04:41	Uh, incised wounds are almost surgical in nature.	N
55	55	55	00:04:41	00:04:43	Used an extremely sharp weapon.	N
56	56	56	00:04:43	00:04:44	Vicious attack.	N
57	57	57	00:04:44	00:04:46	Probably from someone emotionally involved.	N
58	58	58	00:04:46	00:04:49	Time? Best estimate, 00 and midnight.	N
59	59	59	00:04:50	00:04:51	I collected a standard SAE kit.	N
60	60	60	00:04:51	00:04:52	Good.	N
61	61	61	00:04:52	00:04:57	Because top or bottom, this looks like a sexual assault that turned into a hate crime.	N
62	62	62	00:04:59	00:05:00	Clock a Thunderbird doing 90.	N
63	63	63	00:05:01	00:05:02	I nail it.	N
64	64	64	00:05:02	00:05:04	The skirt driving tells me she's being chased.	N
65	65	65	00:05:04	00:05:08	And then she asks if she can show me some videos.	N
66	66	66	00:05:08	00:05:09	How were they?	N
67	67	67	00:05:09	00:05:10	I didn't bite.	N
68	68	68	00:05:10	00:05:12	She was working it.	N
69	69	69	00:05:12	00:05:14	Rough duty.	N
70	70	70	00:05:14	00:05:21	Look, she gave me this lame story about the car being her brother's, and that she had lost her license, but she has his license, and yakety-yak.	N
71	71	71	00:05:21	00:05:23	I just let her off with a warning.	N
72	72	72	00:05:23	00:05:28	So you had speeding, driving without a license, possible stolen vehicle, and you let her off with a warning.	N
73	73	73	00:05:28	00:05:30	What are you implying?	N
74	74	74	00:05:30	00:05:32	She got off pretty easy.	N
75	75	75	00:05:32	00:05:34	How about you?	N
76	76	76	00:05:34	00:05:35	I resent that.	N
77	77	77	00:05:35	00:05:42	Well, I'm sure that she resented being sexually harassed and slaughtered two miles from the place you pulled her over! I didn't know about that until you called me in here.	N
78	78	78	00:05:42	00:05:44	You know, you have a sexual harassment flag in your file.	N
79	79	79	00:05:44	00:05:45	Oh, so that makes me a sex murderer?	N
80	80	80	00:05:45	00:05:48	I know a place about two miles up.	N
81	81	81	00:05:48	00:05:49	It's a little more private.	N
82	82	82	00:05:49	00:05:55	I mean, you know, if... if I found out that the gal who was stripping my gears was a guy, I mean, I'd be mad, too.	N
83	83	83	00:06:00	00:06:01	What are you?! ( screams )	N
84	84	84	00:06:02	00:06:04	Or maybe you prefer a stick.	N
85	85	85	00:06:06	00:06:08	I told you, nothing happened.	N
86	86	86	00:06:08	00:06:10	You're on administrative duty until we confirm that.	N
87	87	87	00:06:10	00:06:12	Mind submitting your DNA?	N
88	88	88	00:06:12	00:06:15	Just tell me where to spit.	N
89	89	89	00:06:15	00:06:18	Ran her prints through I-AFIS and I got two hits.	N
90	90	90	00:06:18	00:06:27	A Wendy Garner was a dancer at the Tangiers, and Walter Clancy, a blackjack dealer at the Riviera in the mid-'90s.	N
91	91	91	00:06:27	00:06:30	Okay, let's give this a shot.	N
92	92	92	00:06:30	00:06:33	The coroner noted that she had collagened lips.	N
93	93	93	00:06:35	00:06:36	Okay, so 86 those cheek implants.	N
94	94	94	00:06:43	00:06:47	Now, estrogen would've rounded out the face, so square that jaw.	N
95	95	95	00:06:47	00:06:50	Got that.	N
96	96	96	00:06:50	00:06:52	I'm gonna give her a haircut.	N
97	97	97	00:06:55	00:06:57	Add some whiskers...	N
98	98	98	00:06:57	00:06:59	Wow.	N
99	99	99	00:06:59	00:07:01	Take away the, uh...	N
100	100	100	00:07:01	00:07:02	eye makeup.	N
101	101	101	00:07:02	00:07:04	And I'll fix the eyebrows.	N
102	102	102	00:07:05	00:07:07	Walter didn't kill Wendy.	N
103	103	103	00:07:07	00:07:11	No, it's more like Wendy killed Walter.	N
104	104	104	00:07:16	00:07:18	One seminal, one saliva.	N
105	105	105	00:07:18	00:07:20	Neither was a match for Officer Mann.	N
106	106	106	00:07:20	00:07:21	Huh.	N
107	107	107	00:07:21	00:07:24	Wow. That is some rock.	N
108	108	108	00:07:24	00:07:25	Platinum setting.	N
109	109	109	00:07:25	00:07:28	Princess cut.	N
110	110	110	00:07:28	00:07:30	Somebody really loved her-- oh-- him.	N
111	111	111	00:07:30	00:07:33	I think she's a her.	N
112	112	112	00:07:33	00:07:35	Right. Well...	N
113	113	113	00:07:35	00:07:37	a diamond that big, you hope she had it LoJacked.	N
114	114	114	00:07:37	00:07:38	That is what I'm counting on.	N
115	115	115	00:07:38	00:07:44	There's a serial number micro-etched into the band around the diamond-- I'm hoping it gets me a groom.	N
116	116	116	00:07:47	00:07:53	You know, I once heard this story about this man who became a woman because he was obsessed with a lesbian...	N
117	117	117	00:07:53	00:07:54	who was really a man.	N
118	118	118	00:07:57	00:07:59	Overshare.	N
119	119	119	00:08:05	00:08:07	Wendy just bought her wedding gown.	N
120	120	120	00:08:07	00:08:10	She, uh, she would've been a beautiful bride.	N
121	121	121	00:08:10	00:08:14	We just wrote our wedding vows last week.	N
122	122	122	00:08:14	00:08:19	I just figured that she was at a friend's house-- a girlfriend's house-- for the night.	N
123	123	123	00:08:19	00:08:23	Mr. Laner, how long had Wendy been a dancer?	N
124	124	124	00:08:23	00:08:25	About two or three years in the line.	N
125	125	125	00:08:25	00:08:27	I mean, never topless.	N
126	126	126	00:08:28	00:08:30	In her costume, she was a vision.	N
127	127	127	00:08:30	00:08:32	How long had you known each other?	N
128	128	128	00:08:32	00:08:33	About a year.	N
129	129	129	00:08:33	00:08:34	We met in a Grief Support Group.	N
130	130	130	00:08:34	00:08:36	I'd lost my wife.	N
131	131	131	00:08:36	00:08:38	Sorry for your loss.	N
132	132	132	00:08:38	00:08:39	Thank you.	N
133	133	133	00:08:39	00:08:42	Who was Wendy grieving for?	N
134	134	134	00:08:42	00:08:45	Uh, she'd... lost her twin brother.	N
135	135	135	00:08:47	00:08:48	Would that be Walter?	N
136	136	136	00:08:48	00:08:50	Yeah, Walter.	N
137	137	137	00:08:50	00:08:52	Did you know him?	N
138	138	138	00:08:52	00:08:55	Sort of.	N
139	139	139	00:10:27	00:10:31	Mr. Laner, I need to ask you a personal question, if you don't mind-- it may help us.	N
140	140	140	00:10:31	00:10:34	Did you and your fiancee sleep in separate beds?	N
141	141	141	00:10:34	00:10:36	Uh...	N
142	142	142	00:10:36	00:10:38	we were an old-fashioned couple.	N
143	143	143	00:10:38	00:10:42	Neither of us believed in premarital sexual relations.	N
144	144	144	00:10:42	00:10:45	I mean, that's why I fell in love with her, because of her traditional values.	N
145	145	145	00:10:48	00:10:49	This is confusing.	N
146	146	146	00:10:49	00:10:51	She had her period?	N
147	147	147	00:10:51	00:10:54	Impossible. No uterus, no period.	N
148	148	148	00:10:54	00:10:57	So a guy desperate to change his sex hooks up with a guy desperate not to have any.	N
149	149	149	00:10:57	00:10:59	A match made in heaven.	N
150	150	150	00:10:59	00:11:01	I think we need to tell Mr. Laner the truth.	N
151	151	151	00:11:01	00:11:03	Are we sure he doesn't know?	N
152	152	152	00:11:24	00:11:27	Aborigines say they dance naked to make the gods happy.	N
153	153	153	00:11:27	00:11:29	The gods would be happy in Vegas.	N
154	154	154	00:11:29	00:11:33	Did you ever see any transsexuals when you danced?	N
155	155	155	00:11:33	00:11:36	Only civilians confuse strippers and showgirls.	N
156	156	156	00:11:36	00:11:38	You can't cheat the full monty.	N
157	157	157	00:11:43	00:11:45	That's Wendy's station over there.	N
158	158	158	00:11:45	00:11:48	Thank you.	N
159	159	159	00:11:48	00:11:49	Hello, ladies.	N
160	160	160	00:11:49	00:11:51	I'm Catherine Willows.	N
161	161	161	00:11:51	00:11:53	This is Gil Grissom. We're with the Crime Lab.	N
162	162	162	00:11:53	00:11:56	Do any of you know if Wendy Garner worked last night?	N
163	163	163	00:11:56	00:12:00	No, she had the day off.	N
164	164	164	00:12:00	00:12:02	But she should be working tonight.	N
165	165	165	00:12:02	00:12:03	And she is late.	N
166	166	166	00:12:03	00:12:04	That's not like her.	N
167	167	167	00:12:05	00:12:06	Why, did something happen to Wendy?	N
168	168	168	00:12:06	00:12:10	Unfortunately, she was found dead last night.	N
169	169	169	00:12:12	00:12:14	It was all those hormones she was taking, wasn't it?	N
170	170	170	00:12:14	00:12:16	Shut up. What do you know?	N
171	171	171	00:12:16	00:12:19	Do you know that Wendy was a, uh...?	N
172	172	172	00:12:19	00:12:20	Trannie?	N
173	173	173	00:12:20	00:12:21	All the best showgirls are.	N
174	174	174	00:12:21	00:12:26	Yeah, and it don't matter if they're packin' a lop job or a gaff.	N
175	175	175	00:12:26	00:12:27	Okay, lop job I get.	N
176	176	176	00:12:27	00:12:29	What's a gaff?	N
177	177	177	00:12:29	00:12:33	It's like a jockstrap, only it hides what it's supposed to strap.	N
178	178	178	00:12:33	00:12:37	We all get work done. Who cares if it's up north or down south?	N
179	179	179	00:12:37	00:12:38	Pretty's pretty.	N
180	180	180	00:12:38	00:12:42	So do you know where she got her work done?	N
181	181	181	00:12:42	00:12:46	You want the best, you go to Dr. Mercer.	N
182	182	182	00:12:47	00:12:56	Okay, so on tonight's agenda, we're going to be talking about hair removal, gait, and we'll do our pride walk, hormones, and voice pitch...	N
183	183	183	00:12:56	00:12:58	Ladies, come on.	N
184	184	184	00:12:58	00:12:59	Over here.	N
185	185	185	00:12:59	00:13:01	Now, regarding hair removal...	N
186	186	186	00:13:01	00:13:03	Are they all women?	N
187	187	187	00:13:03	00:13:06	The ratio of MTFs to FTMs is four to one.	N
188	188	188	00:13:07	00:13:08	Males to females rather than females to males?	N
189	189	189	00:13:09	00:13:12	Bev is one of my patients.	N
190	190	190	00:13:12	00:13:14	Right. Now, who hasn't done their pride walk?	N
191	191	191	00:13:15	00:13:22	The law requires re-gender candidates to spend one year on hormones and one living as the sex of preference.	N
192	192	192	00:13:22	00:13:25	Wendy wanted to fast-track the process and I wouldn't do that.	N
193	193	193	00:13:25	00:13:28	I guess she found somebody who would.	N
194	194	194	00:13:28	00:13:30	Every field has its bottom feeders.	N
195	195	195	00:13:30	00:13:32	Surgery is the easy part.	N
196	196	196	00:13:32	00:13:34	Life afterwards is the challenge.	N
197	197	197	00:13:34	00:13:37	Some candidates get depressed.	N
198	198	198	00:13:37	00:13:41	They're unhappy about their lives and they think surgery is going to chase away all their emotional problems.	N
199	199	199	00:13:41	00:13:45	Dr. Mercer, Wendy didn't commit suicide. She was killed.	N
200	200	200	00:13:45	00:13:50	Oh, God.	N
201	201	201	00:13:50	00:13:51	I am so sorry.	N
202	202	202	00:13:51	00:13:57	As ready as my patients are for the world, I guess the world isn't always ready for them.	N
203	203	203	00:13:58	00:13:59	Hey. Hey.	N
204	204	204	00:13:59	00:14:01	Anything on those pads I collected?	N
205	205	205	00:14:02	00:14:04	Uh, yeah, traces of EDTA.	N
206	206	206	00:14:04	00:14:05	Isn't that an anticoagulant?	N
207	207	207	00:14:05	00:14:07	Yeah. Used in blood-collection vials.	N
208	208	208	00:14:07	00:14:09	So it wasn't the victim's blood?	N
209	209	209	00:14:09	00:14:11	No, it was hers.	N
210	210	210	00:14:11	00:14:13	His? Hers.	N
211	211	211	00:14:13	00:14:15	But no epithelials or fibrinogen, so clearly it wasn't menstrual.	N
212	212	212	00:14:16	00:14:20	So Wendy was having blood drawn and putting it on pads?	N
213	213	213	00:14:20	00:14:22	She was faking her period.	N
214	214	214	00:14:30	00:14:33	What I don't get is why she would do that.	N
215	215	215	00:14:33	00:14:36	Well, she was living as a woman, and that's part of it.	N
216	216	216	00:14:36	00:14:37	I-I don't know.	N
217	217	217	00:14:37	00:14:39	But you don't draw your own blood.	N
218	218	218	00:14:39	00:14:41	I mean, she had to have help.	N
219	219	219	00:14:41	00:14:45	Maybe the same doctor that was keeping her medicine cabinet filled.	N
220	220	220	00:14:45	00:14:49	Hey, these are the pills Eric collected from Wendy Garner's bathroom.	N
221	221	221	00:14:49	00:14:51	For the record, I really like having a penis.	N
222	222	222	00:14:52	00:14:57	Okay, the reds and blues are bootleg estrogen conjugates out of Mexico.	N
223	223	223	00:14:58	00:15:02	Apparently, HMO's don't consider being differently sexed a life-threatening condition.	N
224	224	224	00:15:02	00:15:04	So patients resort to Mexican pharmacies.	N
225	225	225	00:15:04	00:15:08	Premarin's green, a heavy-duty hormonal supplement.	N
226	226	226	00:15:08	00:15:10	Name's short for Pregnant Mare Urine.	N
227	227	227	00:15:10	00:15:12	Talk about your PETA nightmare.	N
228	228	228	00:15:12	00:15:14	What about these other pills?	N
229	229	229	00:15:14	00:15:20	Mexican-grade painkillers, tranquilizers, and a broad-spectrum antibiotic.	N
230	230	230	00:15:20	00:15:23	Sounds like a post-surgery cocktail to me.	N
231	231	231	00:15:25	00:15:27	Grissom.	N
232	232	232	00:15:27	00:15:29	Yes.	N
233	233	233	00:15:29	00:15:32	Mimosa?	N
234	234	234	00:15:32	00:15:35	Yes. Today?	N
235	235	235	00:15:35	00:15:39	00.	N
236	236	236	00:15:39	00:15:42	I'll be here.	N
237	237	237	00:15:42	00:15:44	Did you just get a lunch date?	N
238	238	238	00:16:12	00:16:13	Hello.	N
239	239	239	00:16:13	00:16:16	I'm glad you agreed to meet me.	N
240	240	240	00:16:16	00:16:18	Can I buy you a drink?	N
241	241	241	00:16:18	00:16:20	Thanks, but I'm still on the clock.	N
242	242	242	00:16:20	00:16:23	But you still let me lure you away from the lab.	N
243	243	243	00:16:23	00:16:26	Is that because I'm a beautiful woman?	N
244	244	244	00:16:26	00:16:31	Well, I'm a beautiful woman now.	N
245	245	245	00:16:31	00:16:33	Beauty is a societal construction.	N
246	246	246	00:16:33	00:16:34	So is gender.	N
247	247	247	00:16:34	00:16:44	People find out you're MTF, and they think you're psycho; Michael Caine with a bad wig and a pair of sunglasses stabbing Angie Dickinson in Dressed To Kill.	N
248	248	248	00:16:46	00:16:48	De Palma had some issues.	N
249	249	249	00:16:51	00:16:52	You're an outsider.	N
250	250	250	00:16:52	00:16:55	That's why I trusted you.	N
251	251	251	00:16:55	00:16:57	You get it.	N
252	252	252	00:16:58	00:17:01	Don't worry, Mr. Grissom.	N
253	253	253	00:17:01	00:17:03	This isn't about sex.	N
254	254	254	00:17:03	00:17:04	It's about soul.	N
255	255	255	00:17:05	00:17:08	What was it you that you wanted to trust me with?	N
256	256	256	00:17:08	00:17:13	I loved Wendy.	N
257	257	257	00:17:13	00:17:17	I was there with her through her whole transition.	N
258	258	258	00:17:17	00:17:20	I was going to be her maid of honor.	N
259	259	259	00:17:20	00:17:25	Do you know how hard it is for people like us to find love?	N
260	260	260	00:17:25	00:17:26	Do you know what happened?	N
261	261	261	00:17:26	00:17:30	She called me, hysterical.	N
262	262	262	00:17:30	00:17:32	Uh, I don't know.	N
263	263	263	00:17:32	00:17:35	She kept going on about a videotape or something.	N
264	264	264	00:17:35	00:17:38	What kind of tape, do you know?	N
265	265	265	00:17:38	00:17:39	Blackmail? Pornography?	N
266	266	266	00:17:40	00:17:41	Porn? ( laughs )	N
267	267	267	00:17:41	00:17:42	Oh, my God.	N
268	268	268	00:17:42	00:17:47	Wendy was such a prude, she'd cover the mirror when she got out of the shower.	N
269	269	269	00:17:47	00:17:51	People confuse your obsession with sexuality as an obsession with sex.	N
270	270	270	00:17:52	00:17:59	Imagine being three years old, tormented by the sensation that you had the wrong parts.	N
271	271	271	00:17:59	00:18:04	Your body's like a foreign country and you're stuck without a passport.	N
272	272	272	00:18:04	00:18:15	All because in your first trimester your X and Y chromosomes split off and went different directions; girl brain, boy body.	N
273	273	273	00:18:17	00:18:21	Amoebas at the start were not complex.	N
274	274	274	00:18:21	00:18:25	But then they tore themselves apart and started sex.	N
275	275	275	00:18:25	00:18:33	Well, in the beginning, Wendy's chromosomes might have been tearing themselves apart, but in the end, she was tearing herself apart.	N
276	276	276	00:18:33	00:18:34	Do you know why?	N
277	277	277	00:18:34	00:18:41	I don't know. Planning a wedding, working a rookie vagina, and about to lose her cherry to a man who doesn't know?	N
278	278	278	00:18:41	00:18:43	So she talked to you?	N
279	279	279	00:18:43	00:18:45	She talked about it in group.	N
280	280	280	00:18:45	00:18:48	May I ask the name of your therapist?	N
281	281	281	00:18:51	00:18:52	Dr. Lavalle.	N
282	282	282	00:19:07	00:19:10	Hey, I've been looking for you.	N
283	283	283	00:19:10	00:19:12	You found me.	N
284	284	284	00:19:12	00:19:15	I analyzed the blood on the shoes you gave me.	N
285	285	285	00:19:16	00:19:17	I expected it to be Wendy's blood.	N
286	286	286	00:19:17	00:19:20	It's not hers and it's not Officer Mann's.	N
287	287	287	00:19:20	00:19:22	So it might be the killer's.	N
288	288	288	00:19:22	00:19:28	Well, given the nature of this case, it might be misleading, but I'll ask anyway-- male or female?	N
289	289	289	00:19:29	00:19:32	One donor. All male.	N
290	290	290	00:19:36	00:19:37	Lepidro.	N
291	291	291	00:19:37	00:19:38	What kind of name is that?	N
292	292	292	00:19:38	00:19:40	It's from Lepidoptera, meaning butterfly.	N
293	293	293	00:19:40	00:19:45	Walter Clancy started out a gender-dysmorphic caterpillar and turned into a bloody butterfly.	N
294	294	294	00:19:49	00:19:51	Bye-bye, scrumptious pumpkin.	N
295	295	295	00:19:51	00:19:53	Bye, Amber.	N
296	296	296	00:19:54	00:19:55	Dr. Lavalle?	N
297	297	297	00:19:55	00:19:56	No, I'm Francis.	N
298	298	298	00:19:57	00:19:58	My wife is the doc.	N
299	299	299	00:19:58	00:19:59	Grownups always do that.	N
300	300	300	00:19:59	00:20:02	It's gender-stereotyping, honey.	N
301	301	301	00:20:02	00:20:04	Okay, Francis. I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.	N
302	302	302	00:20:04	00:20:06	This is Gil Grissom from the Crime Lab.	N
303	303	303	00:20:06	00:20:12	Well, if I'm being, intrusive, please tell me, but, I mean, why are you here?	N
304	304	304	00:20:12	00:20:14	Wendy Garner.	N
305	305	305	00:20:14	00:20:16	I know Wendy.	N
306	306	306	00:20:16	00:20:17	She's a patient.	N
307	307	307	00:20:17	00:20:19	She was a patient.	N
308	308	308	00:20:22	00:20:23	My wife is in group.	N
309	309	309	00:20:25	00:20:26	This is really frustrating.	N
310	310	310	00:20:26	00:20:27	They don't get it.	N
311	311	311	00:20:28	00:20:32	She is a beautiful woman now and I love her.	N
312	312	312	00:20:32	00:20:33	Our pastor doesn't know.	N
313	313	313	00:20:33	00:20:35	You need to tell him.	N
314	314	314	00:20:35	00:20:36	The truth goes a long way.	N
315	315	315	00:20:38	00:20:39	Mona?	N
316	316	316	00:20:40	00:20:42	These folks need to speak to you.	N
317	317	317	00:20:42	00:20:44	Eddie, would you take over?	N
318	318	318	00:20:45	00:20:46	Sure.	N
319	319	319	00:20:46	00:20:54	In the Sanctuary Alliance I saw an Eritrean girl who had her labia sewn shut.	N
320	320	320	00:20:54	00:20:56	I looked into her eyes and I found a cause.	N
321	321	321	00:20:57	00:21:01	6,000 women a day suffer genital mutilation.	N
322	322	322	00:21:01	00:21:05	So you travel around the world treating the victims of sexual treachery?	N
323	323	323	00:21:05	00:21:09	You don't have to travel to find the genitally disenfranchised.	N
324	324	324	00:21:09	00:21:10	Like Wendy Garner?	N
325	325	325	00:21:10	00:21:13	Wendy came to me. She was denied surgery.	N
326	326	326	00:21:13	00:21:15	That's devastating.	N
327	327	327	00:21:15	00:21:19	I tried to help her work through that.	N
328	328	328	00:21:19	00:21:22	By finding a doctor who would operate on her?	N
329	329	329	00:21:22	00:21:25	By working with her on what made her an unacceptable candidate.	N
330	330	330	00:21:25	00:21:27	Which was?	N
331	331	331	00:21:27	00:21:28	Patience.	N
332	332	332	00:21:28	00:21:30	When was the last time you saw her?	N
333	333	333	00:21:30	00:21:31	Last night.	N
334	334	334	00:21:31	00:21:34	00 to 8 How did she seem?	N
335	335	335	00:21:34	00:21:35	She was agitated.	N
336	336	336	00:21:35	00:21:41	She was worried about whether her fiancee would receive her well on their wedding night.	N
337	337	337	00:21:42	00:21:43	So he didn't know?	N
338	338	338	00:21:44	00:21:47	I don't recommend what we call passing.	N
339	339	339	00:21:47	00:21:49	I suggested that Aaron come at a group.	N
340	340	340	00:21:49	00:21:52	Wendy was adamant that he never know the truth.	N
341	341	341	00:21:52	00:21:56	Doctor, do you videotape your sessions?	N
342	342	342	00:21:56	00:21:57	No, never.	N
343	343	343	00:21:57	00:21:59	That would violate the doctor-patient privilege.	N
344	344	344	00:22:01	00:22:06	Wendy lived here at 118 Sunshine Road in Green Valley.	N
345	345	345	00:22:06	00:22:10	She left her weekly session with Dr. Lavalle 00 p.m. here.	N
346	346	346	00:22:10	00:22:14	Now, Officer Mann pulled her over on Industrial Road 24 minutes later.	N
347	347	347	00:22:14	00:22:22	She was found dead two miles south of there, supposedly on her way to her friend Mimosa's house here.	N
348	348	348	00:22:22	00:22:26	Takes ten minutes to drive from the clinic to Industrial Road.	N
349	349	349	00:22:26	00:22:27	Yeah. Yeah.	N
350	350	350	00:22:27	00:22:29	I had Greg run it.	N
351	351	351	00:22:30	00:22:33	14 minutes of Wendy's time unaccounted for.	N
352	352	352	00:22:33	00:22:35	That's what I'm saying.	N
353	353	353	00:22:35	00:22:40	She must've stopped somewhere between the clinic and where Officer Mann clocked her doing 90.	N
354	354	354	00:22:40	00:22:41	Somewhere in this highlighted area.	N
355	355	355	00:22:41	00:22:43	Yeah, but there's nothing out there.	N
356	356	356	00:22:43	00:22:44	Not so fast.	N
357	357	357	00:22:44	00:22:46	Sara found this in the medicine cabinet.	N
358	358	358	00:22:46	00:22:47	It's a Post-It.	N
359	359	359	00:22:47	00:22:50	G-105, Section E.	N
360	360	360	00:22:50	00:22:53	What does that have to do with her medicine cabinet?	N
361	361	361	00:22:53	00:22:55	Doesn't have anything to do with the medicine cabinet.	N
362	362	362	00:22:55	00:22:59	I thought it was map coordinates or something like that, but it's not.	N
363	363	363	00:22:59	00:23:03	You know what they have a lot of up in this area?	N
364	364	364	00:23:03	00:23:04	Storage facilities.	N
365	365	365	00:23:18	00:23:19	What's the number again?	N
366	366	366	00:23:19	00:23:20	G-105.	N
367	367	367	00:23:20	00:23:22	Should be right down here.	N
368	368	368	00:23:24	00:23:25	Hey, hey, watch your step. Watch your step.	N
369	369	369	00:23:25	00:23:26	I got footprints.	N
370	370	370	00:23:28	00:23:30	Those look like bloody footprints.	N
371	371	371	00:23:30	00:23:33	Yeah.	N
372	372	372	00:24:12	00:24:13	Nick, hit the lights.	N
373	373	373	00:24:16	00:24:17	Oh, no.	N
374	374	374	00:24:43	00:24:44	Catherine.	N
375	375	375	00:24:44	00:24:45	Yeah?	N
376	376	376	00:24:45	00:24:47	What do you think went on here?	N
377	377	377	00:24:47	00:24:52	Someone outsourced their health care to the wrong provider.	N
378	378	378	00:24:59	00:25:00	At least...	N
379	379	379	00:25:00	00:25:03	something was sterile.	N
380	380	380	00:25:03	00:25:05	Maybe why I'm not getting any prints.	N
381	381	381	00:25:05	00:25:08	Hey. Hi, Jim.	N
382	382	382	00:25:08	00:25:11	So I, uh... I talked to the manager.	N
383	383	383	00:25:11	00:25:16	All he said was, the renter paid cash, he was a guy, he seemed normal.	N
384	384	384	00:25:17	00:25:20	Normal people don't torture people in storage bins.	N
385	385	385	00:25:32	00:25:34	Piano wires.	N
386	386	386	00:25:34	00:25:39	They're used to mobilize the lower part of the abdominal skin and anchor the neo-vagina, so it can heal in place.	N
387	387	387	00:25:39	00:25:42	I can only imagine those cramps.	N
388	388	388	00:25:42	00:25:48	The surgeon stuffs the portal with a cylinder wrapped in gauze to hold its shape while it heals, and sutures it.	N
389	389	389	00:25:48	00:25:52	And how long does milady have to wear a wire?	N
390	390	390	00:25:52	00:25:55	Well, after five days, the vagina is un-sutured, and the wires are removed.	N
391	391	391	00:25:55	00:25:59	Scarring indicates multiple surgeries.	N
392	392	392	00:25:59	00:26:03	She appears to have gone in for repair due to infection.	N
393	393	393	00:26:03	00:26:06	I take it that wasn't supposed to happen.	N
394	394	394	00:26:06	00:26:09	Maybe someone wasn't taking their hormones.	N
395	395	395	00:26:09	00:26:11	Or they were taking some bad Mexican bootlegs.	N
396	396	396	00:26:11	00:26:15	Now, that is more than a five o'clock shadow.	N
397	397	397	00:26:15	00:26:17	It's a myth that hair grows after death.	N
398	398	398	00:26:17	00:26:21	What happens is, the skin contracts, revealing whiskers.	N
399	399	399	00:26:21	00:26:27	Contraction of the erector pilae muscles, combined with fixed lividity, indicates time of death was at least two days ago.	N
400	400	400	00:26:28	00:26:29	So she died before Wendy.	N
401	401	401	00:26:29	00:26:32	Yeah, sad as this is, it presents as accidental.	N
402	402	402	00:26:32	00:26:35	Loss of blood due to hemorrhaging.	N
403	403	403	00:26:35	00:26:36	Pelvic artery was severed.	N
404	404	404	00:26:36	00:26:39	surgery one, they botched.	N
405	405	405	00:26:39	00:26:42	Round two, they repaired her to death.	N
406	406	406	00:28:13	00:28:14	Hi.	N
407	407	407	00:28:14	00:28:22	Do you know a Vern Saldusky, aka Tawny, peaches, Vava? One second, honey.	N
408	408	408	00:28:23	00:28:26	Okay.	N
409	409	409	00:28:33	00:28:34	You want to talk to Mercedes.	N
410	410	410	00:28:34	00:28:37	She's in the back.	N
411	411	411	00:28:37	00:28:38	Thank you.	N
412	412	412	00:28:38	00:28:39	You're welcome.	N
413	413	413	00:28:39	00:28:41	Thanks.	N
414	414	414	00:29:03	00:29:06	I've never seen junkies shoot up in the face before.	N
415	415	415	00:29:06	00:29:09	It's not smack, it's silicone.	N
416	416	416	00:29:09	00:29:10	Gives you good cheek bones.	N
417	417	417	00:29:11	00:29:13	The ones who can't buy silicone...	N
418	418	418	00:29:13	00:29:15	shoot motor oil.	N
419	419	419	00:29:15	00:29:17	Do they?	N
420	420	420	00:29:17	00:29:19	Calm down, pretty boy. We're not the monsters.	N
421	421	421	00:29:19	00:29:25	The real freaks are the suit-and-ties want to take a walk on the wild side-- before sneaking back to the wife and kids.	N
422	422	422	00:29:25	00:29:26	Want to go?	N
423	423	423	00:29:26	00:29:28	Mm-mm.	N
424	424	424	00:29:28	00:29:29	Mercedes, I presume?	N
425	425	425	00:29:29	00:29:34	We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and we're looking for somebody.	N
426	426	426	00:29:34	00:29:39	Isn't this where you say my P.O. would be interested to know that I'm hustling, and you ask for a freebie?	N
427	427	427	00:29:39	00:29:45	I'm actually not interested in your ass, but the person we're looking for is a human butcher who might be.	N
428	428	428	00:29:46	00:29:48	I'm listening.	N
429	429	429	00:29:48	00:29:52	The game is helping transgenders who have been turned down for surgery.	N
430	430	430	00:30:03	00:30:04	You want Benway.	N
431	431	431	00:30:04	00:30:07	Benway did my transition, but something went wrong.	N
432	432	432	00:30:07	00:30:09	And now I can't be a man or a woman.	N
433	433	433	00:30:09	00:30:11	Want to see?	N
434	434	434	00:30:11	00:30:12	No. No, that's all right.	N
435	435	435	00:30:12	00:30:13	No, it's not all right.	N
436	436	436	00:30:13	00:30:16	He keeps canceling my corrective surgery.	N
437	437	437	00:30:16	00:30:18	That may be why you're still alive.	N
438	438	438	00:30:18	00:30:20	A friend of mine had to go back four times.	N
439	439	439	00:30:20	00:30:22	Finally, he fitted her with a colostomy bag.	N
440	440	440	00:30:22	00:30:25	Benway felt so bad, he hooked it up for free.	N
441	441	441	00:30:25	00:30:27	Where can we find this humanitarian?	N
442	442	442	00:30:27	00:30:31	Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia-- one of the ias, I don't know.	N
443	443	443	00:30:31	00:30:32	He flies in and flies out.	N
444	444	444	00:30:32	00:30:33	No one's ever seen him.	N
445	445	445	00:30:34	00:30:37	He shows up as you go under, and splits before you come to.	N
446	446	446	00:30:37	00:30:41	Do you know Vern Saldusky?	N
447	447	447	00:30:41	00:30:42	You mean Tawny?	N
448	448	448	00:30:42	00:30:44	Yeah, Benway just did her.	N
449	449	449	00:30:46	00:30:52	Jacqui got an AFIS hit off the bloody fingerprint from the toothpaste tube found in Vern's vagina.	N
450	450	450	00:30:52	00:30:57	Wow. Came back a Dr. Karl Benway, military service.	N
451	451	451	00:30:57	00:31:05	Well, we found out that this creepy looking thing is an abdominal retractor, used to keep the cavity open during surgery.	N
452	452	452	00:31:05	00:31:08	It's only sold in surgical supply stores.	N
453	453	453	00:31:08	00:31:14	And other than hospitals, the only individual who's purchased one in the last year and a half in Las Vegas, Nevada, is Dr. Karl Benway.	N
454	454	454	00:31:16	00:31:18	We know the name of the butcher.	N
455	455	455	00:31:18	00:31:19	Benway.	N
456	456	456	00:31:22	00:31:23	Okay.	N
457	457	457	00:31:23	00:31:27	What do you know about him, and do we have an address?	N
458	458	458	00:31:27	00:31:33	Total dead end-- he's not registered with the AMA; he's not in the DMV database; he has no passport issued in the state of Nevada.	N
459	459	459	00:31:33	00:31:38	So we've got a non-doctor who served in the military who doesn't drive and never leaves the country.	N
460	460	460	00:31:38	00:31:40	Sara, you asked for some...	N
461	461	461	00:31:40	00:31:41	research.	N
462	462	462	00:31:41	00:31:44	Microfiche. Medical journals.	N
463	463	463	00:31:44	00:31:45	The stacks.	N
464	464	464	00:31:45	00:31:48	There's not a lot on this guy, but this is what I've been able to find.	N
465	465	465	00:31:48	00:31:51	Vietnam vet-- served as a medic.	N
466	466	466	00:31:51	00:31:54	Then it looks like he did a short stint with the Sanctuary Alliance in Ghana.	N
467	467	467	00:31:54	00:32:00	He goes from Ghana to Mexico, where he's arrested and deported for performing illegal abortions.	N
468	468	468	00:32:00	00:32:01	Was his medical license revoked?	N
469	469	469	00:32:01	00:32:02	No.	N
470	470	470	00:32:02	00:32:05	Benway never went to medical school.	N
471	471	471	00:32:05	00:32:08	In 1983, he was arrested for protesting outside the Supreme Court.	N
472	472	472	00:32:08	00:32:11	1987, San Francisco Chronicle article.	N
473	473	473	00:32:11	00:32:14	He was interviewed at an anti-nuke rally.	N
474	474	474	00:32:14	00:32:16	And photographed.	N
475	475	475	00:32:17	00:32:19	Know what?	N
476	476	476	00:32:19	00:32:22	I believe Dr. Lavalle...	N
477	477	477	00:32:23	00:32:25	...is Dr. Benway.	N
478	478	478	00:32:27	00:32:30	Boy, you must get pretty jet-lagged flying back and forth to Bulgaria.	N
479	479	479	00:32:32	00:32:35	Or is it Romania... Karl?	N
480	480	480	00:32:38	00:32:41	I haven't been Karl Benway for a very long time.	N
481	481	481	00:32:41	00:32:45	Yeah, like three days ago, when you killed Vern Saldusky at the E-Z Access storage unit?	N
482	482	482	00:32:45	00:32:48	That's a hell of a place for an operating room.	N
483	483	483	00:32:49	00:32:52	I mean, why not go all the way and use the men's room at the bus station?	N
484	484	484	00:32:54	00:32:56	We found your fingerprint there.	N
485	485	485	00:32:56	00:32:57	I never said I wasn't there.	N
486	486	486	00:32:57	00:32:59	I attended Vern's surgery.	N
487	487	487	00:32:59	00:33:01	He was... terrified.	N
488	488	488	00:33:02	00:33:03	I tried to calm him.	N
489	489	489	00:33:04	00:33:06	Can't get any calmer than dead.	N
490	490	490	00:33:07	00:33:08	I'm a counselor.	N
491	491	491	00:33:09	00:33:15	Is that how your fingerprint ended up on a three-day-old vagina?	N
492	492	492	00:33:15	00:33:16	Counseling?	N
493	493	493	00:33:21	00:33:26	I've devoted my life to helping those who are cast out by gender prejudice.	N
494	494	494	00:33:26	00:33:28	Where would these souls be without me?	N
495	495	495	00:33:28	00:33:29	Who will stand in judgment?	N
496	496	496	00:33:29	00:33:31	As to who's a candidate and who's not.	N
497	497	497	00:33:32	00:33:33	Dr. Mercer?	N
498	498	498	00:33:33	00:33:37	I was the only one willing to help them.	N
499	499	499	00:33:39	00:33:43	I was 19 in the rice paddies of Vietnam...	N
500	500	500	00:33:43	00:33:46	sewing legs back on grunts.	N
501	501	501	00:33:46	00:33:49	I performed abortions in Mexico...	N
502	502	502	00:33:49	00:33:53	on rape victims when the church turned its back on them.	N
503	503	503	00:33:53	00:33:56	I have been doing gender reassignment surgery for ten years.	N
504	504	504	00:33:56	00:34:00	You've been performing surgeries without a medical degree...	N
505	505	505	00:34:00	00:34:02	Doctor.	N
506	506	506	00:34:04	00:34:06	How many Verns have there been?	N
507	507	507	00:34:07	00:34:09	How many Wendys?	N
508	508	508	00:34:16	00:34:19	Vern was an unfortunate tragedy.	N
509	509	509	00:34:19	00:34:23	I have no idea what happened to Wendy.	N
510	510	510	00:34:23	00:34:24	She saw you with Vern.	N
511	511	511	00:34:24	00:34:27	So you killed her, so she wouldn't expose you.	N
512	512	512	00:34:27	00:34:30	That's impossible.	N
513	513	513	00:34:30	00:34:36	After I saw Wendy at the clinic, I went straight to my daughter's soccer game.	N
514	514	514	00:34:36	00:34:38	I have nothing more to say.	N
515	515	515	00:34:38	00:34:41	We need you to say ahh.	N
516	516	516	00:34:43	00:34:48	So, I heard Brass arrested Dr. Lavalle, who is really Dr. Benway? Mm-hmm.	N
517	517	517	00:34:48	00:34:50	Which means her DNA is male. Right.	N
518	518	518	00:34:50	00:34:54	In one of the latex gloves at the storage facility, I found female DNA.	N
519	519	519	00:34:54	00:34:57	Well, Vern was a male, and Dr. Lavalle was a male.	N
520	520	520	00:34:57	00:34:59	So the doctor had help.	N
521	521	521	00:35:02	00:35:03	This is ridic...	N
522	522	522	00:35:03	00:35:05	What you have done to my wife is disgraceful!	N
523	523	523	00:35:05	00:35:08	You're not gonna find anything here!	N
524	524	524	00:35:08	00:35:09	Officer, could you escort this man outside.	N
525	525	525	00:35:09	00:35:10	This is discrimination.	N
526	526	526	00:35:10	00:35:15	We are normal people, trying to live a normal life.	N
527	527	527	00:35:15	00:35:19	I think we have a spitter, my friend.	N
528	528	528	00:35:19	00:35:22	Really? Yeah.	N
529	529	529	00:35:24	00:35:26	I'll check the back.	N
530	530	530	00:35:26	00:35:29	All right.	N
531	531	531	00:36:00	00:36:01	Take her home!	N
532	532	532	00:36:01	00:36:05	Would you... just get her out of here!	N
533	533	533	00:36:05	00:36:07	Can I take care of my daughter, please?	N
534	534	534	00:36:08	00:36:13	Francis, what is going on? Daddy, what's going on?	N
535	535	535	00:36:13	00:36:15	It's okay, honey. Amber's gonna take you home.	N
536	536	536	00:36:15	00:36:16	I want to go with you. Where's Mommy? I know.	N
537	537	537	00:36:16	00:36:17	Mommy's gonna be right back.	N
538	538	538	00:36:17	00:36:18	I can't take her.	N
539	539	539	00:36:18	00:36:20	I have the night shift at the hospital. Fr...	N
540	540	540	00:36:21	00:36:22	She shouldn't be seeing this.	N
541	541	541	00:36:22	00:36:23	She's your kid, too.	N
542	542	542	00:36:23	00:36:25	Take some responsibility. Okay, fine.	N
543	543	543	00:36:25	00:36:26	Good.	N
544	544	544	00:36:27	00:36:29	Put your belt on.	N
545	545	545	00:36:29	00:36:31	Come on, can you pull it?	N
546	546	546	00:36:42	00:36:44	I don't understand why I'm here.	N
547	547	547	00:36:44	00:36:53	Well, you're here because I compared your DNA from this cigarette butt to sweat recovered from the inside of a latex glove at the crime scene.	N
548	548	548	00:36:55	00:36:57	( beeping ) Busted artery!	N
549	549	549	00:37:02	00:37:04	Ms. Hamshaw...	N
550	550	550	00:37:04	00:37:09	Dr. Lavalle was performing illegal surgeries, and you were assisting.	N
551	551	551	00:37:09	00:37:12	Now, why would you be involved with something like that?	N
552	552	552	00:37:12	00:37:16	Mona and Francis helped me clean up.	N
553	553	553	00:37:16	00:37:21	They gave me money to be a surrogate mom for Tippi and got me my RN degree.	N
554	554	554	00:37:21	00:37:23	They're family.	N
555	555	555	00:37:23	00:37:28	So Tippi has two dads and one mom?	N
556	556	556	00:37:29	00:37:32	Actually, it's two moms and a dad.	N
557	557	557	00:37:32	00:37:35	Okay, tell me about Wendy Garner.	N
558	558	558	00:37:35	00:37:39	Her procedure was completely successful.	N
559	559	559	00:37:39	00:37:41	Well, right up till her death.	N
560	560	560	00:37:41	00:37:43	I had nothing to do with that.	N
561	561	561	00:37:43	00:37:46	I was at Tippi's soccer game with Mona.	N
562	562	562	00:38:32	00:38:34	Okay, now what's next?	N
563	563	563	00:38:34	00:38:36	I don't know. We've got Belle.	N
564	564	564	00:38:37	00:38:38	Belle.	N
565	565	565	00:38:38	00:38:40	Belle.	N
566	566	566	00:38:40	00:38:42	That's so sweet...	N
567	567	567	00:38:44	00:38:47	God, what is this?	N
568	568	568	00:38:47	00:38:49	How could you do this?	N
569	569	569	00:38:49	00:38:53	I just wanted you to keep my secret from Aaron, not this.	N
570	570	570	00:38:53	00:38:54	I trusted you.	N
571	571	571	00:38:54	00:38:57	How could you just leave her like this?	N
572	572	572	00:39:04	00:39:06	I mean, this day means so much to me.	N
573	573	573	00:39:06	00:39:10	And to have girlfriends like you, it's just amazing.	N
574	574	574	00:39:10	00:39:14	30 seconds of mutilation recorded over a bridal shower.	N
575	575	575	00:39:14	00:39:18	She told her best friend and Officer Mann that she had some videos to show.	N
576	576	576	00:39:19	00:39:23	I think she must have been trying to expose Lavalle.	N
577	577	577	00:39:28	00:39:29	Brown.	N
578	578	578	00:39:29	00:39:31	Really?	N
579	579	579	00:39:32	00:39:34	Thanks.	N
580	580	580	00:39:35	00:39:36	That was Brass.	N
581	581	581	00:39:36	00:39:42	Ten soccer moms confirm they saw Dr. Lavalle and Amber Hamshaw at the soccer game the night Wendy was killed.	N
582	582	582	00:39:42	00:39:44	Another dead end.	N
583	583	583	00:39:44	00:39:47	Those fingerprints on the videotape you recovered?	N
584	584	584	00:39:47	00:39:49	We got a match.	N
585	585	585	00:39:49	00:39:51	Wendy's videotape...	N
586	586	586	00:39:51	00:39:53	your fingerprint.	N
587	587	587	00:39:53	00:39:56	Doctor, help me understand something.	N
588	588	588	00:39:56	00:40:08	Wendy videotaped the storage area, threatening to expose your wife's good work because your wife was threatening to tell Wendy's fiancee that she's not what she appears to be.	N
589	589	589	00:40:11	00:40:14	But the three of you were still getting it on.	N
590	590	590	00:40:14	00:40:15	I beg your pardon?	N
591	591	591	00:40:15	00:40:25	Based on the DNA that we found in Wendy's cheek, you were swapping spit with her, and your wife was swapping something else with her.	N
592	592	592	00:40:25	00:40:28	Now we know that post-ops can't ejaculate.	N
593	593	593	00:40:28	00:40:33	So the only way I can explain the semen in Wendy's mouth is your wife is still packing.	N
594	594	594	00:40:33	00:40:36	Yes, and I performed fellatio on my wife...	N
595	595	595	00:40:36	00:40:37	after lunch.	N
596	596	596	00:40:37	00:40:39	Is that a crime?	N
597	597	597	00:40:41	00:40:43	I have no idea how anything got into Wendy's mouth.	N
598	598	598	00:40:43	00:40:44	My wife and I did not cheat.	N
599	599	599	00:40:46	00:40:47	You don't get it, do you?	N
600	600	600	00:40:47	00:40:49	Because we're different.	N
601	601	601	00:40:49	00:40:52	We still love.	N
602	602	602	00:40:53	00:40:55	We still honor.	N
603	603	603	00:40:55	00:40:57	Is that why you hacked out Wendy's Adam's apple?	N
604	604	604	00:40:57	00:40:58	Love and honor?	N
605	605	605	00:40:58	00:41:02	You went back to the storage area to get rid of Vern's body.	N
606	606	606	00:41:02	00:41:04	You saw Wendy leaving.	N
607	607	607	00:41:17	00:41:21	Mimosa, look, it's me.	N
608	608	608	00:41:22	00:41:23	I need your help, okay?	N
609	609	609	00:41:23	00:41:25	I have these videos and I have to show you them.	N
610	610	610	00:41:25	00:41:28	You're never going to believe what's on them.	N
611	611	611	00:41:28	00:41:29	These people...	N
612	612	612	00:41:36	00:41:38	How dare you?!	N
613	613	613	00:41:49	00:41:53	I tried to protect my wife's work.	N
614	614	614	00:41:53	00:41:55	Not just for us.	N
615	615	615	00:41:55	00:41:58	For all the people like us.	N
616	616	616	00:42:00	00:42:02	So the man admits to murder but not infidelity.	N
617	617	617	00:42:02	00:42:04	Well, maybe he wasn't unfaithful.	N
618	618	618	00:42:04	00:42:10	You know, I read a paper in the JFS documenting a case where a woman kissed a man, who had smoked a cigarette.	N
619	619	619	00:42:10	00:42:13	When they tested the cigarette butt, they found both their DNA on it.	N
620	620	620	00:42:13	00:42:15	So you're saying it was transfer?	N
621	621	621	00:42:15	00:42:24	Well, if Francis gave his wife fellatio shortly before he killed Wendy, it's possible that some of the semen was still in his mouth, and it got transferred onto her through his spit.	N
622	622	622	00:42:29	00:42:30	Right.	N
623	623	623	00:42:30	00:42:32	Don't you think?	N
624	624	624	00:42:33	00:42:37	I thought you'd want to know what happened to Wendy.	N
625	625	625	00:42:37	00:42:39	I appreciate your telling me.	N
626	626	626	00:42:39	00:42:42	Killed by someone in our own community.	N
627	627	627	00:42:42	00:42:45	As if we don't have enough enemies.	N
628	628	628	00:42:48	00:42:54	Her parents never understood her, but still I think they should know.	N
629	629	629	00:42:54	00:42:57	What do I say?	N
630	630	630	00:43:00	00:43:02	Show them an oyster.	N
631	631	631	00:43:02	00:43:04	I'm sorry?	N
632	632	632	00:43:04	00:43:10	There are two types of male oysters, and one of them can change genders at will.	N
633	633	633	00:43:10	00:43:14	And before man crawled out of the muck, maybe he had the same option.	N
634	634	634	00:43:14	00:43:25	Maybe originally we were supposed to be able to switch genders, and being born with just one sex... is a mutation.	N
