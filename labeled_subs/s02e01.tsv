0	00:00:47	00:00:49	Hey.	N
1	00:00:49	00:00:51	How'd you guys get out?	N
2	00:01:14	00:01:18	What's the matter, boys?	N
3	00:01:18	00:01:20	Easy. Hey...	N
4	00:01:46	00:01:48	Have you been inside?	N
5	00:01:50	00:01:52	What have you got?	N
6	00:02:02	00:02:03	There you go, Detective.	N
7	00:02:03	00:02:05	Thanks.	N
8	00:02:05	00:02:06	Little tired this morning.	N
9	00:02:06	00:02:07	Pulling a double.	N
10	00:02:07	00:02:09	Yeah, join the club.	N
11	00:02:10	00:02:12	Good morning, Catherine.	N
12	00:02:12	00:02:15	Good morning, Gil.	Y
13	00:02:16	00:02:19	So, this is Tony Braun's house.	N
14	00:02:19	00:02:21	Son of Sam Braun.	N
15	00:02:21	00:02:24	He was Steve Wynn before Steve Wynn.	N
16	00:02:24	00:02:26	Oh, yeah, you bet your ass.	N
17	00:02:26	00:02:28	Sam came to Vegas when Vegas was dying.	N
18	00:02:28	00:02:31	Built three casinos in a year.	N
19	00:02:31	00:02:33	Had ties to Bugsy Siegel.	N
20	00:02:36	00:02:40	Wish I had Tony Braun's gardener working for me.	N
21	00:02:40	00:02:42	Guy sniffed it out from the jump.	N
22	00:02:42	00:02:44	Blinds were drawn shut.	N
23	00:02:44	00:02:45	Side gate unlocked.	N
24	00:02:45	00:02:46	Dogs let out.	N
25	00:02:46	00:02:50	A plus B plus C equals 9-1-1.	N
26	00:03:01	00:03:04	All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?	N
27	00:03:09	00:03:11	Chasing the dragon.	N
28	00:03:11	00:03:12	A pinch of H.	N
29	00:03:12	00:03:13	Heat the foil.	N
30	00:03:13	00:03:15	Inhale the fumes.	N
31	00:03:19	00:03:23	With a Xanax back.	N
32	00:03:23	00:03:26	100 pills.	N
33	00:03:26	00:03:28	Prescription filled yesterday.	N
34	00:03:28	00:03:31	So the rumors about ol' Tony boy are true.	N
35	00:03:31	00:03:32	Drug overdose.	N
36	00:03:32	00:03:36	It sure seems that way.	N
37	00:03:36	00:03:39	If only life were that simple.	N
38	00:04:21	00:04:23	Eight rolls. Two copies.	N
39	00:04:23	00:04:26	Case is hot. Put a rush on it.	N
40	00:04:40	00:04:42	Lose an earring?	N
41	00:04:43	00:04:45	Looks like somebody did.	N
42	00:04:51	00:04:54	He's got adhesive residue on his wrists.	N
43	00:04:54	00:04:55	He was restrained.	N
44	00:04:55	00:04:57	Some sort of tape.	N
45	00:04:57	00:04:58	Well, that would be the obvious.	N
46	00:04:58	00:04:59	Braun had company.	N
47	00:04:59	00:05:01	Welcome...	N
48	00:05:01	00:05:03	or unwelcome?	N
49	00:05:03	00:05:04	Where's the purge?	N
50	00:05:04	00:05:07	Car blows its engine, there's an oil leak.	N
51	00:05:07	00:05:09	A guy ODs, where's the body fluid?	N
52	00:05:09	00:05:10	Urine, vomit, excrement.	N
53	00:05:10	00:05:12	Did somebody clean him up?	N
54	00:05:16	00:05:20	Interesting love bites on the chest.	N
55	00:05:20	00:05:21	Curious, isn't it?	N
56	00:05:24	00:05:26	And he's posed.	N
57	00:05:27	00:05:31	When did you know this was a homicide and not an OD?	N
58	00:05:31	00:05:31	Initially?	N
59	00:05:31	00:05:32	Yeah.	N
60	00:05:32	00:05:34	When I saw the TV on.	N
61	00:05:41	00:05:46	Well, I'll tell you one thing-- if those were my dogs I wouldn't be leaving this gate open.	N
62	00:05:46	00:05:48	Yeah, you're talking about a dog owner on heroin.	N
63	00:05:48	00:05:50	How responsible can he be?	N
64	00:05:50	00:05:54	Gardener said it was the first time in five years that he'd found this gate unlocked.	N
65	00:05:54	00:05:56	What's so different about this morning?	N
66	00:05:56	00:05:58	Last morning of Tony Braun's life?	N
67	00:05:58	00:06:06	Well, either somebody inside the house opened it, or somebody had a key because this lock hasn't been forced.	N
68	00:06:06	00:06:08	There's no pry marks.	N
69	00:06:08	00:06:09	No metal shavings.	N
70	00:06:09	00:06:11	So... why was the gate open?	N
71	00:06:13	00:06:15	A heroin addict's confetti.	N
72	00:06:16	00:06:18	Nothing like going on a binge.	N
73	00:06:28	00:06:30	Some black tar heroin.	N
74	00:06:30	00:06:34	This is the difference between a Cadillac and a Pinto.	N
75	00:06:34	00:06:35	How would you know?	N
76	00:06:35	00:06:36	It's my job.	N
77	00:06:36	00:06:40	I count at least six balloons, and that's just in the bedroom.	N
78	00:06:40	00:06:43	The dealer must have come down the chimney.	N
79	00:06:43	00:06:45	It's like Christmas in July here.	N
80	00:06:48	00:06:51	Not that Braun even needed any more drugs.	N
81	00:06:51	00:06:53	Yeah, looks like the guy had a pill for everything.	N
82	00:06:53	00:06:55	Can you get a print off those balloons?	N
83	00:06:55	00:06:58	I can get a print off the air.	N
84	00:07:02	00:07:03	Any luck?	N
85	00:07:03	00:07:06	I have gone through every garbage can in the house.	N
86	00:07:06	00:07:07	What about the cans outside?	N
87	00:07:07	00:07:09	First thing I checked. Zip.	N
88	00:08:15	00:08:16	Hey, Doc.	N
89	00:08:16	00:08:19	Leg fell asleep.	N
90	00:08:22	00:08:25	I always wondered which one of us coroners would get to carve Tony.	N
91	00:08:29	00:08:34	His lifestyle was no secret-- sex, drugs and a big bankroll.	N
92	00:08:34	00:08:36	No needle marks on his arms.	N
93	00:08:36	00:08:42	The guy plays golf; short-sleeved shirts Checked between the toes... groin area.	N
94	00:08:42	00:08:45	Whatever he did went up his nose.	N
95	00:08:45	00:08:48	His nasal cavity looks like raw hamburger.	N
96	00:08:53	00:08:56	These abrasions around his mouth? What?	N
97	00:08:56	00:08:58	Hard to shave when you're stoned?	N
98	00:08:58	00:08:59	Or they're pressure marks.	N
99	00:08:59	00:09:05	For example, if someone places a pillow or object against someone's nose and mouth in the climate of struggle.	N
100	00:09:07	00:09:09	Petechial hemorrhaging?	N
101	00:09:09	00:09:11	Also suggestive of suffocation.	N
102	00:09:11	00:09:13	Not always.	N
103	00:09:13	00:09:17	For as much as pathology is an absolute science, it isn't.	N
104	00:09:17	00:09:22	Vessels can rupture under innocent circumstances such as a violent cough.	N
105	00:09:22	00:09:26	These three, circular, red marks on his chest?	N
106	00:09:26	00:09:28	They're not bug bites.	N
107	00:09:28	00:09:37	No neurotoxins present but that's not to say some overanxious paramedic trying to save a legend's life didn't cause them in the moment.	N
108	00:09:37	00:09:39	CPR wasn't performed.	N
109	00:09:39	00:09:40	Then I don't know what they are.	N
110	00:09:40	00:09:43	It's hard to OD just inhaling heroin.	N
111	00:09:43	00:09:51	I know he was restrained which leads me to believe that someone forced him to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and Xanax.	N
112	00:09:53	00:09:54	Excuse me.	N
113	00:09:56	00:09:59	Boy, are you lucky my lawyer's on a golf course.	N
114	00:09:59	00:10:05	I've been standing out here, in the heat for hours, answering these stupid questions.	N
115	00:10:05	00:10:07	Here's your answer, okay.	N
116	00:10:07	00:10:08	This is my house.	N
117	00:10:08	00:10:09	Okay?	N
118	00:10:09	00:10:12	This is half my house anyway.	N
119	00:10:12	00:10:14	Who's this?	N
120	00:10:14	00:10:15	It's Braun's squeeze.	N
121	00:10:15	00:10:17	She's an ex-stripper, too.	N
122	00:10:17	00:10:19	Perhaps you two met in a professional capacity.	N
123	00:10:19	00:10:20	These are my things...	N
124	00:10:20	00:10:22	And, uh, where has she been the past 12 hours?	N
125	00:10:22	00:10:23	Uh, let's see.	N
126	00:10:23	00:10:25	Oh, my God.	N
127	00:10:25	00:10:29	Out.	N
128	00:10:29	00:10:31	When Tony's drug dealer showed up, she split.	N
129	00:10:31	00:10:32	She slept at a friend's house.	N
130	00:10:32	00:10:37	She didn't like the way Tony acted when he was cruising on magic carpets.	N
131	00:10:37	00:10:42	Look, you two, listen-- if anything is missing from this house I'm going to add you to my lawyer's to sue list.	N
132	00:10:42	00:10:45	Why don't you just put the camera away before you get arrested?	N
133	00:10:45	00:10:48	You can't arrest me in my own house.	N
134	00:10:48	00:10:50	Right now, your house is our crime scene...	N
135	00:10:52	00:10:56	and we can do whatever we want and that includes fingerprinting you.	N
136	00:10:56	00:10:58	Why?	N
137	00:10:58	00:10:59	Didn't do anything.	N
138	00:10:59	00:11:02	Thumb to pinkie.	N
139	00:11:02	00:11:04	I just lost my boyfriend, okay?	N
140	00:11:04	00:11:06	You're a woman.	N
141	00:11:06	00:11:09	I'm just looking out for my end here, you know?	N
142	00:11:09	00:11:11	Things start to disappear.	N
143	00:11:11	00:11:16	If Tony were here right now, he'd tell you himself Just make sure Janine's taken care of.	N
144	00:11:17	00:11:18	That's a lawyer's call.	N
145	00:11:18	00:11:19	Hey, I'm in the will.	N
146	00:11:20	00:11:22	Of course you are.	N
147	00:11:30	00:11:31	Can I help you?	N
148	00:11:31	00:11:32	Yeah. Is Sam Braun in?	N
149	00:11:32	00:11:34	He's not seeing anyone today.	N
150	00:11:34	00:11:38	Would you let him know that Catherine Willows is here to see him?	N
151	00:11:43	00:11:45	Just one second, please.	N
152	00:11:58	00:11:59	Mugs?	N
153	00:12:10	00:12:13	I remember the first time I saw you.	Y
154	00:12:13	00:12:15	You didn't have any clothes on.	N
155	00:12:15	00:12:18	Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.	N
156	00:12:18	00:12:22	I would've taken you home right then, if you had let me.	N
157	00:12:22	00:12:24	I know, but you were married.	N
158	00:12:24	00:12:26	I was a baby.	N
159	00:12:26	00:12:29	It would've never worked.	N
160	00:12:29	00:12:32	Sam... how are you holding up?	N
161	00:12:32	00:12:34	Hey, Dad, I got the press clogging up Valet.	N
162	00:12:34	00:12:37	Should I call Security or just handle it, or what?	N
163	00:12:37	00:12:38	I'll take care of it.	N
164	00:12:38	00:12:40	You go back to the pit.	N
165	00:12:40	00:12:42	Make sure nobody's robbing us blind.	N
166	00:12:44	00:12:53	You know, back in, uh... in '67 I was in my 20s and...	N
167	00:12:53	00:12:56	I was drinking in a dive in downtown Buffalo.	N
168	00:12:56	00:13:04	At the end of the bar was this pro quarterback drinking double scotches, two at a time 00 in the morning.	N
169	00:13:04	00:13:07	It's Sunday, game day, mind you.	N
170	00:13:07	00:13:08	So you know what I did?	N
171	00:13:08	00:13:10	Called my bookie, bet against him.	N
172	00:13:10	00:13:13	Guess what?	N
173	00:13:13	00:13:18	I'll be damned if he didn't throw six touchdown passes.	N
174	00:13:18	00:13:20	Yeah...	N
175	00:13:20	00:13:22	Sounds like Tony.	N
176	00:13:23	00:13:31	You know, even when Tony was juicing he could run circles around these college, Harvard types.	N
177	00:13:33	00:13:37	And I'm not saying that just because he was my kid.	N
178	00:13:37	00:13:47	Tony was the best damn casino exec this town has ever seen and just between you and me...	N
179	00:13:47	00:13:49	I couldn't hold a candle to him.	N
180	00:13:51	00:13:53	Now he's dead.	N
181	00:13:55	00:13:57	Overdose.	N
182	00:13:57	00:14:01	Sam...	N
183	00:14:01	00:14:07	The bigger the pedestal the bigger the target.	N
184	00:14:10	00:14:16	Nobody shoots at that target without going through me.	N
185	00:14:16	00:14:19	Well, that's business.	N
186	00:14:19	00:14:21	What about personal?	N
187	00:14:25	00:14:26	What do you mean?	N
188	00:14:26	00:14:29	Did you ever talk to Tony about any of his girlfriends?	N
189	00:14:30	00:14:30	Which one?	N
190	00:14:31	00:14:34	I mean, they were all trying to pick the gold out of his teeth.	N
191	00:14:34	00:14:35	Janine Haywood.	N
192	00:14:35	00:14:36	She's the worst...	N
193	00:14:37	00:14:39	and he loved her the most.	N
194	00:14:39	00:14:40	Can you believe it?	N
195	00:14:40	00:14:42	Yeah, I do.	N
196	00:14:47	00:14:54	If I know her type, now that she has the gold she'll be going after the silver.	N
197	00:16:03	00:16:10	Okay, on the left, Braun prints we got from the Coroner and on the right, gold digger prints I got from Janine Haywood.	N
198	00:16:10	00:16:12	Here's where it gets interesting.	N
199	00:16:12	00:16:14	I took six prints off this bottle.	N
200	00:16:14	00:16:16	And? They all belong to one person.	N
201	00:16:16	00:16:19	Good thing or... bad thing?	N
202	00:16:19	00:16:21	It's good if you're us...	N
203	00:16:23	00:16:25	bad if you're Janine Haywood.	N
204	00:16:30	00:16:32	Have you seen Brass?	N
205	00:16:32	00:16:34	Not tonight, no. Why?	N
206	00:16:34	00:16:35	Oh, print off air.	N
207	00:16:35	00:16:37	Orange balloon.	N
208	00:16:37	00:16:38	Cyanoacrylate.	N
209	00:16:38	00:16:40	Dead bang, drug dealer.	N
210	00:16:41	00:16:43	Ooh, ooh, watch it! Evidence.	N
211	00:16:43	00:16:45	Where did you get it? Cracker box.	N
212	00:16:45	00:16:47	It was all stuck together, muckety-muck.	N
213	00:16:47	00:16:51	I don't want to ruin any potential prints but I saw this TV dinner commercial and it hit me.	N
214	00:16:51	00:16:53	I'm going to put it in the freezer.	N
215	00:16:56	00:16:58	Did you try this coffee?	N
216	00:16:58	00:16:59	Mm-mm.	N
217	00:16:59	00:17:01	The last cup I had tasted like motor oil.	N
218	00:17:01	00:17:03	Oh, don't touch it. That's my pot!	N
219	00:17:05	00:17:06	Your pot?	N
220	00:17:06	00:17:08	Yeah, you know, from my own private stash.	N
221	00:17:08	00:17:10	Blue Hawaiian-- $40 a pound.	N
222	00:17:10	00:17:14	Only grown a couple times a year on the Big Island hand-picked to perfection.	N
223	00:17:15	00:17:16	Good.	N
224	00:17:16	00:17:18	You're using my water so I guess that makes it community coffee.	N
225	00:17:18	00:17:19	You want a cup, Nick?	N
226	00:17:19	00:17:21	No, thanks.	N
227	00:17:21	00:17:22	What's the matter with your leg?	N
228	00:17:22	00:17:23	I don't know, man.	N
229	00:17:23	00:17:26	Something back at that house must have bit me.	N
230	00:17:26	00:17:29	Oh, is that alcohol on a bug bite?	N
231	00:17:29	00:17:31	That's like butter on burns, man.	N
232	00:17:31	00:17:33	Wives' tale.	N
233	00:17:33	00:17:35	Yeah, this is the guy who told me to put hemorrhoid cream on my acne.	N
234	00:17:36	00:17:38	It worked, didn't it?	N
235	00:17:41	00:17:43	This is pretty good.	N
236	00:17:44	00:17:48	Let me see the bite before you get gangrene.	N
237	00:17:48	00:17:49	Chigger bite. Yeah?	N
238	00:17:50	00:17:52	Probably picked it up walking through the ferns in Braun's backyard.	N
239	00:17:53	00:17:54	See if Catherine's got some clear nail polish.	N
240	00:17:54	00:17:56	It'll seal it off from the air, keep it from itching.	N
241	00:17:58	00:17:59	What happened with that doggy door?	N
242	00:18:00	00:18:02	Something definitely two-legged went through it.	N
243	00:18:02	00:18:03	Got mostly partials.	N
244	00:18:03	00:18:05	Print Lab's working on it now.	N
245	00:18:05	00:18:07	Be sure to check it against Janine Haywood's prints.	N
246	00:18:09	00:18:11	Braun's stomach contents.	N
247	00:18:11	00:18:13	No food.	N
248	00:18:13	00:18:14	Plenty of drugs.	N
249	00:18:14	00:18:15	Xanax?	N
250	00:18:15	00:18:16	And heroin.	N
251	00:18:16	00:18:17	I thought he inhaled it.	N
252	00:18:17	00:18:19	Inhaled and ingested.	N
253	00:18:19	00:18:20	He ate it?	N
254	00:18:20	00:18:21	Got there somehow.	N
255	00:18:21	00:18:24	Where are all the undissolved pills?	N
256	00:18:24	00:18:25	Didn't find any.	N
257	00:18:25	00:18:29	Most OD's die before digestion's complete, right?	N
258	00:18:29	00:18:34	My guess, someone mashed up the Xanax dissolved them in red wine, which I did find.	N
259	00:18:34	00:18:38	Okay, so what do we know that we can write home about?	N
260	00:18:38	00:18:44	Well, Braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means he was probably meek as a lamb.	N
261	00:18:44	00:18:47	Wouldn't have taken much to bind his hands with duct tape.	N
262	00:18:47	00:18:49	And make him drink hemlock.	N
263	00:18:49	00:18:54	It's a lot easier to pour liquid down a guy's throat than it is to make him swallow 100 pills.	N
264	00:18:54	00:18:56	It wasn't 100 pills.	N
265	00:18:56	00:18:57	How many?	N
266	00:18:59	00:19:00	No more than 50.	N
267	00:19:06	00:19:08	Based on your pupes, I could take you in right now.	N
268	00:19:08	00:19:10	Hey, man, I'm in mourning.	N
269	00:19:10	00:19:11	It's tears you see.	N
270	00:19:11	00:19:12	I lost a customer.	N
271	00:19:12	00:19:15	It's like losing my job, kind of.	N
272	00:19:15	00:19:16	You're Braun's grocery store.	N
273	00:19:16	00:19:18	But I deliver.	N
274	00:19:18	00:19:19	When did you last deliver?	N
275	00:19:19	00:19:21	Night before he croaked.	N
276	00:19:21	00:19:23	00-- ask his woman.	N
277	00:19:23	00:19:25	She's fine, too.	N
278	00:19:25	00:19:27	Well, she told us as soon as you got there, she left.	N
279	00:19:27	00:19:29	Oh, she didn't go that fast.	N
280	00:19:29	00:19:33	I dropped off some balloons Braun paid me, she gave me a tip.	N
281	00:19:33	00:19:35	What, shave the soul patch?	N
282	00:19:37	00:19:38	No.	N
283	00:19:38	00:19:40	30 Xanadus.	N
284	00:19:40	00:19:41	Xanax?	N
285	00:19:41	00:19:43	I told you I dropped them down the bathroom sink.	N
286	00:19:43	00:19:46	First time I heard that.	N
287	00:19:46	00:19:53	Look, I took two gave Tony two and I accidentally dropped 15 or 20 down the sink.	N
288	00:19:53	00:19:55	It was an accident.	N
289	00:19:55	00:19:56	You know, an accident?	N
290	00:19:56	00:19:58	Haven't you ever spilled a drink?	N
291	00:19:59	00:20:00	Not lately.	N
292	00:20:00	00:20:02	We found 50 Xanax in Tony's stomach.	N
293	00:20:02	00:20:04	Don't pin that on me. I'd left.	N
294	00:20:04	00:20:07	I'll tell you what you left-- your fingerprints all over the prescription bottle.	N
295	00:20:07	00:20:14	I went to the pharmacy waited in line picked up the prescription signed for it brought it back to the house.	N
296	00:20:14	00:20:18	Tony did nothing for himself except work and get high.	N
297	00:20:18	00:20:20	Got you a brand-new Mercedes, didn't it?	N
298	00:20:20	00:20:21	Yes, it did.	N
299	00:20:21	00:20:25	And it'll buy me the dress I wear at Tony's funeral, too.	N
300	00:20:25	00:20:28	Look, when you left your half a house where did you go?	N
301	00:20:28	00:20:29	A friend's.	N
302	00:20:29	00:20:30	Well, let's get her on the line.	N
303	00:20:30	00:20:32	She's out of town.	N
304	00:20:32	00:20:34	Let me guess-- she's incommunicado.	N
305	00:20:34	00:20:36	That means you can't reach her?	N
306	00:20:36	00:20:38	Yeah.	N
307	00:20:40	00:20:42	Oh, mind the dummy.	N
308	00:20:44	00:20:45	It's been 24 minutes, Greg.	N
309	00:20:45	00:20:46	When's this thing going to be done?	N
310	00:20:46	00:20:49	Well, with all due respect, sir, it's not a baked potato.	N
311	00:20:49	00:20:55	It's Braun's blood and with all the impurities in his system it might take a little extra time.	N
312	00:20:55	00:20:57	Did I ever tell you I used to live in New York?	N
313	00:20:57	00:21:00	Is this going to be a short story or a novel?	N
314	00:21:00	00:21:02	( machine beeps ) Excuse me.	N
315	00:21:03	00:21:05	You know, heroin has a nine-minute half-life.	N
316	00:21:05	00:21:07	After that, it metabolizes into morphine.	N
317	00:21:07	00:21:09	What's the six-MAM count?	N
318	00:21:09	00:21:11	158 nanograms per mil.	N
319	00:21:11	00:21:13	Definitely not lethal.	N
320	00:21:13	00:21:14	The same with your Xanax.	N
321	00:21:14	00:21:17	Quarter-mil tabs, 100 micrograms per liter.	N
322	00:21:17	00:21:18	Again, not lethal.	N
323	00:21:18	00:21:21	There's addicts walking around Times Square with more drugs in their system.	N
324	00:21:21	00:21:24	So Braun should still be walking around.	N
325	00:21:27	00:21:31	And the point of your New York story was...?	N
326	00:21:31	00:21:36	Oh, I was just going to tell you about another way to take heroin-- a suppository up the coolee.	N
327	00:21:36	00:21:38	You just stand on your head, and then you let gravity...	N
328	00:21:40	00:21:42	Forget it.	N
329	00:21:49	00:21:52	Braun didn't die of a drug overdose accidental or otherwise.	N
330	00:21:52	00:21:55	I figured. So why'd I bring the dummy?	N
331	00:21:58	00:22:00	Braun's shirt.	N
332	00:22:00	00:22:02	Robbins opened him up.	N
333	00:22:02	00:22:03	His lungs were compressed.	N
334	00:22:03	00:22:10	Remember Burke and Hare the two 19th century Scottish body snatchers who made a living intoxicating innocent victims and suffocating them?	N
335	00:22:10	00:22:12	Sold their cadavers to teaching hospitals?	N
336	00:22:12	00:22:16	Got away with it, too, until a medical student discovered his fiancee on a slab.	N
337	00:22:16	00:22:20	Is this part of the Sherlock Holmes Fan Club kit?	N
338	00:22:20	00:22:25	Janine Haywood said that she left the house when the drug dealer arrived.	N
339	00:22:25	00:22:27	I think she came back.	N
340	00:22:27	00:22:31	So Braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then.	N
341	00:22:33	00:22:37	Would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up 50 pills...	N
342	00:22:39	00:22:43	and force-feed him a Xanax cocktail.	N
343	00:22:43	00:22:47	So everything was going great until the gardener showed up.	N
344	00:22:47	00:22:49	Then I think her plan turned to panic.	N
345	00:22:49	00:22:53	It takes time to OD-- time Janine didn't have.	N
346	00:22:56	00:23:01	Burke would kneel on his victim's chest, right covering their mouth and nostrils.	N
347	00:23:01	00:23:07	But when you're doing drugs you're a slob and when you're being manhandled, you're even sloppier.	N
348	00:23:09	00:23:11	Like this.	N
349	00:23:18	00:23:20	He was Burked.	N
350	00:23:24	00:23:26	Hello.	N
351	00:23:28	00:23:30	Where?	N
352	00:23:30	00:23:32	Brass, you're breaking up.	N
353	00:23:35	00:23:38	Said he was in Blue Diamond, digging something up.	N
354	00:24:04	00:24:07	Hey... Hey, what's going on?	N
355	00:24:07	00:24:09	Anybody ever tell you to call before you dig?	N
356	00:24:09	00:24:11	I got permission to be here.	N
357	00:24:13	00:24:14	From who?	N
358	00:24:14	00:24:16	A dead man?	N
359	00:24:16	00:24:17	You got a name?	N
360	00:24:17	00:24:19	My name's Curt Ritten.	N
361	00:24:19	00:24:22	Look, Tony Braun was a friend of mine, right?	N
362	00:24:22	00:24:23	This is his property.	N
363	00:24:23	00:24:25	He calls me about a month ago.	N
364	00:24:25	00:24:27	He says If anything should happen to me, you start digging.	N
365	00:24:27	00:24:30	You take care of what's mine at all costs.	N
366	00:24:30	00:24:32	That's what I'm doing.	N
367	00:24:32	00:24:33	Do me a favor.	N
368	00:24:33	00:24:35	Put down the shovel.	N
369	00:24:35	00:24:37	Okay.	N
370	00:24:37	00:24:38	Stand over there.	N
371	00:24:38	00:24:39	Okay.	N
372	00:24:39	00:24:41	Maybe Janine had a helper.	N
373	00:24:44	00:24:48	Hey, guys, you might want to check out the basement.	N
374	00:25:42	00:25:46	A sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night.	N
375	00:25:46	00:25:49	That's a lot of motive.	N
376	00:25:52	00:25:54	And a lot of silver.	N
377	00:26:31	00:26:35	Okay, three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by Curt Ritten.	N
378	00:26:35	00:26:36	Nice.	N
379	00:26:36	00:26:39	Let's see if that's where my print came from.	N
380	00:26:39	00:26:40	No match!	N
381	00:26:40	00:26:42	Oh, listen to you.	N
382	00:26:42	00:26:48	Would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth?	N
383	00:26:48	00:26:49	Let me ask you something.	N
384	00:26:49	00:26:53	Braun collected silver-- coins, bullion-- 23 tons of it.	N
385	00:26:53	00:26:55	Why bury it in Blue Diamond?	N
386	00:26:55	00:26:57	'Cause he was smart.	N
387	00:26:57	00:27:14	In the past 20 years the value of silver's gone to nothing and a commodity broker's going to charge you a storage fee per troy ounce and there's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year and that's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee.	N
388	00:27:14	00:27:17	What good's collecting silver coupons when you're dead?	N
389	00:27:17	00:27:18	Depends on who's doing the clipping.	N
390	00:27:20	00:27:22	Oh, we got a positive association.	N
391	00:27:22	00:27:24	Roll to tape.	N
392	00:27:24	00:27:26	Curt to Tony.	N
393	00:27:28	00:27:29	You arresting me for digging?	N
394	00:27:29	00:27:32	No, burglary, theft and conspiracy, to start.	N
395	00:27:32	00:27:36	Tony asked me to move his silver collection up to his ranch in Wyoming.	N
396	00:27:36	00:27:37	I'm doing what I was told.	N
397	00:27:37	00:27:38	Mr. Ritten...	N
398	00:27:38	00:27:44	it appears that we may have physical evidence connecting you to the murder of Tony Braun.	N
399	00:27:44	00:27:46	Look, I had nothing to do with the drugs.	Y
400	00:27:46	00:27:50	I swear to you, I haven't messed around with that stuff in a long time.	Y
401	00:27:50	00:27:54	I was always telling Tony, as a friend to get off of it, to walk away.	N
402	00:27:54	00:27:56	How'd you know where the silver was buried?	N
403	00:27:56	00:27:57	Because I built the vault for him.	N
404	00:27:57	00:27:59	I'm a contractor. That's what I do.	N
405	00:27:59	00:28:00	Ever work on his house?	N
406	00:28:00	00:28:01	No.	N
407	00:28:01	00:28:05	We did... we did talk about me building a basement for him once.	N
408	00:28:06	00:28:07	It never got off the ground.	N
409	00:28:07	00:28:09	Oh, so, you've been to his house?	N
410	00:28:09	00:28:10	We were friends.	Y
411	00:28:10	00:28:12	I've been to his house plenty of times.	Y
412	00:28:12	00:28:13	I was there a couple weeks ago.	N
413	00:28:13	00:28:15	We were watching the Notre Dame game together.	N
414	00:28:15	00:28:17	Did you ever leave anything there?	N
415	00:28:17	00:28:19	Did you ever bring anything over to his house?	N
416	00:28:19	00:28:24	Yeah, I brought a six-pack and some chips-- sour cream.	N
417	00:28:24	00:28:26	Tools of the trade, Curt.	N
418	00:28:26	00:28:29	Construction items-- hammer, duct tape?	N
419	00:28:29	00:28:30	No.	N
420	00:28:31	00:28:32	Why would I do that?	N
421	00:28:32	00:28:34	I got no idea what you're talking about.	N
422	00:28:34	00:28:38	Yeah, well, whatever you don't tell us, we'll find it.	N
423	00:28:46	00:28:48	That's the quickest warrant I ever got.	N
424	00:28:48	00:28:51	Yep. Braun family. Long arms.	N
425	00:28:55	00:28:59	I thought you said that Ritten's wife lives in Carson City.	N
426	00:28:59	00:29:00	She does.	N
427	00:29:00	00:29:01	They both do.	N
428	00:29:01	00:29:04	He just stays here when he's working.	N
429	00:29:04	00:29:06	Or digging up silver.	N
430	00:29:21	00:29:23	Mrs. Ritten?	Y
431	00:29:24	00:29:26	Criminalistics.	N
432	00:29:30	00:29:31	Police officer.	N
433	00:29:37	00:29:39	Geez!	Y
434	00:29:39	00:29:41	You scared me.	Y
435	00:29:41	00:29:42	How'd you get in here?	N
436	00:29:42	00:29:45	I don't have to ask you that question.	N
437	00:29:45	00:29:46	How can this be, Mandy?	Y
438	00:29:46	00:29:48	We found the duct tape in the guy's truck.	Y
439	00:29:48	00:29:51	You're telling us the prints on that tape aren't his or hers?	N
440	00:29:51	00:29:54	Well, if their names are Curt Ritten and Janine Haywood the answer's, No, it's not their prints.	N
441	00:29:54	00:29:56	This is ridiculous.	N
442	00:29:56	00:29:57	This thing must have a virus.	N
443	00:29:57	00:29:59	Maybe you have the wrong suspects.	N
444	00:29:59	00:30:01	Well, that's easy for you to say.	N
445	00:30:01	00:30:03	All you do is scan prints all day and hit enter.	N
446	00:30:03	00:30:05	Look, I'm not your beast of burden.	N
447	00:30:05	00:30:07	Sara, this is your thing.	N
448	00:30:07	00:30:10	Mandy... give me something dandy.	N
449	00:30:10	00:30:12	I'll give you something dandy.	N
450	00:30:12	00:30:13	Your doggie-door prints.	N
451	00:30:14	00:30:17	Good-bye, I have to go on a break now.	N
452	00:30:21	00:30:22	See what I mean?	N
453	00:30:22	00:30:23	Your prints came back unknown, too?	Y
454	00:30:23	00:30:25	No.	Y
455	00:30:25	00:30:27	Came back Walt Braun.	Y
456	00:30:27	00:30:28	Who is he?	Y
457	00:30:28	00:30:30	He's Tony Braun's brother.	Y
458	00:30:30	00:30:35	He's a pit boss at the Tangiers which is why his prints were on file-- gaming card.	Y
459	00:30:35	00:30:36	He's family.	N
460	00:30:36	00:30:39	Why's he using the doggie door and not the front door?	N
461	00:30:39	00:30:40	Go figure.	Y
462	00:30:40	00:30:44	The more evidence that shows up the more this case doesn't make sense.	Y
463	00:30:44	00:30:48	We got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the duct tape.	Y
464	00:30:48	00:30:50	Or on the doggie door...	N
465	00:30:50	00:30:51	but the brother's are.	N
466	00:30:51	00:30:52	Mm-hmm.	N
467	00:30:52	00:30:53	So, call the print lab.	N
468	00:30:53	00:30:54	It's been done.	N
469	00:30:54	00:30:56	They're not Walt Braun's prints on the tape.	N
470	00:30:57	00:30:58	Came back unknown.	N
471	00:30:59	00:31:00	Hey.	N
472	00:31:00	00:31:03	I've got Detective Vega rounding up Walt Braun.	Y
473	00:31:03	00:31:07	Apparently, this Janine Haywood really got around.	Y
474	00:31:07	00:31:13	When she wasn't at Braun's house playing girlfriend, she's over at Vault Boy's flat playing mistress...	Y
475	00:31:13	00:31:16	which gives neither of them a credible alibi.	Y
476	00:31:16	00:31:19	Flimsy alibis don't prove murder.	N
477	00:31:19	00:31:20	What else have we got?	N
478	00:31:20	00:31:21	Nothing probative.	N
479	00:31:21	00:31:23	Then I let the girlfriend go.	N
480	00:31:23	00:31:26	Curt Ritten goes back to lock-up until he posts bail.	Y
481	00:31:26	00:31:27	Look, forget Curt.	Y
482	00:31:27	00:31:29	Forget Janine. Forget the suspects.	Y
483	00:31:29	00:31:30	It's simple.	Y
484	00:31:30	00:31:36	We got to figure out how a piece of duct tape from a roll we found in Curt Ritten's truck ended up wrapped around the wrists of our victim.	Y
485	00:31:36	00:31:38	Without Curt's prints on it.	Y
486	00:31:41	00:31:42	Curt, we're out of here.	N
487	00:31:42	00:31:44	Oh, you're going to take this, too, huh?	N
488	00:31:44	00:31:46	Bonnie...	Y
489	00:31:46	00:31:50	I come down here with a check to bail my husband out and you say to him, We're out of here?	Y
490	00:31:50	00:31:51	No, honey, you're out of here!	Y
491	00:31:51	00:31:52	Bonnie, take it easy.	Y
492	00:31:52	00:31:53	Take it easy?!	N
493	00:31:54	00:31:55	How many men do you need, huh?	N
494	00:31:55	00:31:57	Hey, at least I can take care of mine.	N
495	00:31:57	00:32:02	I've stuck by you through the bankruptcies the flings, the lies, and I have had it, okay?	Y
496	00:32:02	00:32:03	So, you choose.	N
497	00:32:03	00:32:04	Me or her?	N
498	00:32:04	00:32:07	Sorry, Janine.	Y
499	00:32:07	00:32:08	Yeah...	Y
500	00:32:08	00:32:10	Heard that before.	N
501	00:32:11	00:32:13	Call me.	Y
502	00:32:13	00:32:16	Bail processing is this way.	N
503	00:32:24	00:32:25	Been there.	N
504	00:32:25	00:32:28	You came down here to ask me about a doggie door?	Y
505	00:32:28	00:32:30	I could've just told you over the phone.	Y
506	00:32:30	00:32:31	It's a quirk.	N
507	00:32:31	00:32:34	I always like to discuss fingerprints in person.	Y
508	00:32:34	00:32:35	Hmm. Tony and I went to dinner.	Y
509	00:32:35	00:32:36	How long ago?	Y
510	00:32:36	00:32:38	A while back.	N
511	00:32:38	00:32:40	Be more specific.	N
512	00:32:40	00:32:41	Uh, about a month and a half ago.	N
513	00:32:41	00:32:46	We ate at Piero's talked a little business-- I dropped him off.	Y
514	00:32:46	00:32:48	Walt...	N
515	00:32:49	00:32:50	My key still works here.	N
516	00:32:50	00:32:53	How come it doesn't work on the front door?	N
517	00:32:53	00:32:54	I changed the locks.	N
518	00:32:54	00:33:00	And, so, I used the doggie door walked through the house, opened the door, let Tony in.	Y
519	00:33:00	00:33:03	Guy with that kind of money doesn't have a security alarm?	N
520	00:33:03	00:33:05	When you're a Braun there's nothing you can't replace.	N
521	00:33:05	00:33:08	You can't replace your brother.	N
522	00:33:08	00:33:11	What's the matter with your leg?	N
523	00:33:11	00:33:13	I don't know. Something must've bit me.	N
524	00:33:13	00:33:15	Mind if I take a look?	N
525	00:33:15	00:33:16	What are you, a dermatologist?	Y
526	00:33:16	00:33:18	I'm an entomologist, actually.	Y
527	00:33:18	00:33:20	I-I know all about bugs.	N
528	00:33:20	00:33:21	Sure.	N
529	00:33:21	00:33:23	Can you tell me what to put on it?	N
530	00:33:23	00:33:24	It's killing me.	N
531	00:33:24	00:33:26	Chigger bites.	N
532	00:33:27	00:33:31	You might want to try some nail polish, keep it from itching.	N
533	00:33:31	00:33:35	Would you mind if I took a photograph for my bite collection?	N
534	00:33:35	00:33:37	Whatever rubs your Buddha.	N
535	00:33:43	00:33:44	We're almost done.	N
536	00:33:44	00:33:47	Mr. Braun, uh, where do you live?	Y
537	00:33:47	00:33:48	Shoshone Hi-Rise-- J.W. Brown Road.	N
538	00:33:48	00:33:50	And you work here?	N
539	00:33:50	00:33:52	Yeah, I'm a glorified pit boss.	N
540	00:33:52	00:33:57	In the, uh, last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places?	N
541	00:33:57	00:33:58	No.	N
542	00:33:58	00:34:00	My life's pretty routine.	N
543	00:34:01	00:34:05	It might just get a little more routine.	N
544	00:34:10	00:34:12	Nick, I need your leg.	N
545	00:34:12	00:34:13	Show me your bite.	N
546	00:34:13	00:34:15	Oh, it's no worries. I got some cream.	N
547	00:34:15	00:34:15	Hey.	N
548	00:34:15	00:34:17	All right.	N
549	00:34:17	00:34:19	It's no big deal, really.	N
550	00:34:28	00:34:31	What time did you log in at the Braun house?	Y
551	00:34:31	00:34:32	15 that morning.	N
552	00:34:32	00:34:35	How long after that did you start processing the backyard?	N
553	00:34:35	00:34:36	About a half hour.	N
554	00:34:36	00:34:39	You're not the only one with chigger bites.	N
555	00:34:39	00:34:41	Who is this?	N
556	00:34:41	00:34:42	Walt Braun.	Y
557	00:34:42	00:34:44	30 at night.	Y
558	00:34:44	00:34:47	Approximately 36 hours ago, you were bitten.	N
559	00:34:47	00:34:50	Three hours earlier than that Tony Braun was murdered.	N
560	00:34:50	00:34:52	Chiggers run a predictable course.	N
561	00:34:52	00:35:05	A chigger attaches itself to a hair follicle injects a digest enzyme into the skin which ruptures the surrounding cells allowing the chigger to suck them up leaving behind a red, itchy bump.	Y
562	00:35:05	00:35:06	So...?	N
563	00:35:06	00:35:08	Walt Braun lied.	N
564	00:35:08	00:35:14	We now have an entomological timeline that places him at the house on the day his brother was murdered.	N
565	00:35:14	00:35:15	I don't know, Boss.	N
566	00:35:15	00:35:22	I mean, ask yourself the question-- are doggie-door prints and chigger bites enough to get a man for murder?	N
567	00:35:33	00:35:35	What've we got?	N
568	00:35:35	00:35:36	Well, I got motive.	N
569	00:35:36	00:35:38	According to the family lawyer, the drug addict...	N
570	00:35:38	00:35:41	Now, Jim, that's just a little callous.	N
571	00:35:41	00:35:42	I'm calling it what it is.	N
572	00:35:42	00:35:48	I know you're friends with the family but the guy used heroin. He was a drug addict who stood in line to inherit the old man's fortune.	N
573	00:35:48	00:35:49	What about the brother?	N
574	00:35:49	00:35:51	Walt's out of the picture. Out in the cold.	N
575	00:35:51	00:35:52	He is? Yeah.	N
576	00:35:52	00:35:54	Tony promised he'd take care of him.	N
577	00:35:54	00:35:58	Whatever he got, he'd split 50-50 all in...	N
578	00:35:58	00:35:59	silver included...	N
579	00:35:59	00:36:00	up until about a month ago.	N
580	00:36:00	00:36:03	But Tony changed his mind, which changed the will.	N
581	00:36:03	00:36:10	So, wait a second-- Janine, the stripper claims that half of everything is hers so that's actually more than just wishful thinking?	N
582	00:36:10	00:36:12	Bet Walt wasn't too happy about that.	N
583	00:36:12	00:36:14	It's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way.	N
584	00:36:15	00:36:17	Curt was digging up the silver to protect Janine's interest.	N
585	00:36:17	00:36:20	So, what's right in front of us that we're missing?	N
586	00:36:20	00:36:21	What evidence do we have that's still open?	N
587	00:36:21	00:36:25	Got the references off of Walt Braun gave the samples to Greg.	N
588	00:36:25	00:36:31	Couple of things Tape lifts, adhesive residue, I got the earring back.	N
589	00:36:31	00:36:33	Where'd you find that?	N
590	00:36:33	00:36:34	Living room, near the body.	N
591	00:36:34	00:36:36	We have to deal with that earring.	N
592	00:36:36	00:36:37	We got to test it against Janine.	N
593	00:36:37	00:36:40	You want to swab me, go ahead but I can save you the Q-Tip.	N
594	00:36:40	00:36:41	That's really not my style.	N
595	00:36:42	00:36:43	Ms. Haywood...	Y
596	00:36:43	00:36:45	you have pierced ears. Yeah.	Y
597	00:36:45	00:36:47	He doesn't understand. I don't wear studs.	Y
598	00:36:47	00:36:49	Haven't worn studs since, like...	N
599	00:36:49	00:36:51	God, seventh grade.	Y
600	00:36:51	00:36:52	Mm-hmm.	Y
601	00:36:53	00:36:55	Can I see that picture?	Y
602	00:36:55	00:36:58	Thanks. See?	Y
603	00:36:58	00:37:01	This is an earring back. It goes to a stud earring.	N
604	00:37:01	00:37:03	I don't wear studs. I'm more of, like, a dangle gal.	N
605	00:37:03	00:37:04	I like chandeliers. They move with you.	N
606	00:37:05	00:37:06	They're on wires. They don't have a back.	Y
607	00:37:06	00:37:08	Are you finished?	Y
608	00:37:08	00:37:10	Open your mouth.	Y
609	00:37:13	00:37:15	Don't bite down. Wouldn't want you to swallow it.	Y
610	00:37:15	00:37:21	How about your girlfriends or Tony's girlfriends-- any of them wear studs?	Y
611	00:37:21	00:37:24	no women allowed in the house.	N
612	00:37:24	00:37:29	Tony had a wandering eye, he had a wad of cash who needed that drama? What about the maid?	Y
613	00:37:31	00:37:35	Heavyset, over 50, no makeup, no jewelry, no English.	Y
614	00:37:35	00:37:37	Wow. You got this whole thing down don't you?	N
615	00:37:37	00:37:39	Yeah. This is my house.	N
616	00:37:39	00:37:41	I didn't do anything wrong.	N
617	00:37:41	00:37:43	And I inherited Josie, and she cleans real good.	N
618	00:37:43	00:37:44	How often does she vacuum?	N
619	00:37:44	00:37:46	Every day.	N
620	00:37:47	00:37:48	Except on her day off.	N
621	00:37:48	00:37:50	Hmm. The day Tony died.	N
622	00:37:50	00:37:52	Hmm.	N
623	00:37:53	00:37:55	Well, if the maid is as good as Janine says she is...	N
624	00:37:55	00:37:57	then the earring back was lost that day.	N
625	00:37:59	00:38:02	There. Well, maybe not.	N
626	00:38:02	00:38:03	The earring back-- not Janine's.	N
627	00:38:04	00:38:05	But it was in the ear of a female.	N
628	00:38:05	00:38:07	So, I guess rule number one was broken.	N
629	00:38:07	00:38:09	There was a woman in the house.	N
630	00:38:09	00:38:11	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?	Y
631	00:38:11	00:38:14	Whoever's prints are on the duct tape is missing an earring back.	Y
632	00:38:14	00:38:16	Who's the only other woman in the story?	Y
633	00:38:16	00:38:18	She lives in Carson City.	N
634	00:38:18	00:38:20	She's here now. She has access to Curt's truck.	N
635	00:38:20	00:38:22	We saw the fight in the police department.	N
636	00:38:22	00:38:24	Hell hath no fury...	N
637	00:38:25	00:38:28	It's not mine. I don't wear earrings.	Y
638	00:38:28	00:38:33	It's funny, just recently I had a little education in earrings and I noticed that you have pierced ears.	N
639	00:38:33	00:38:34	Yeah. So what?	Y
640	00:38:34	00:38:39	If you don't wear earrings for a while the holes will close up.	Y
641	00:38:39	00:38:41	Will you volunteer as a DNA sample?	Y
642	00:38:41	00:38:44	It will confirm your story or confirm ours.	N
643	00:38:44	00:38:46	I'm not giving you anything.	Y
644	00:38:46	00:38:49	It's okay, Jim, we have enough.	N
645	00:38:49	00:38:51	You should let your husband rot in jail.	N
646	00:38:51	00:38:56	We lifted your thumbprint from the check that you posted for his bail.	N
647	00:38:56	00:39:01	We compared it to a set of unknown prints that we found on some duct tape at the crime scene.	Y
648	00:39:01	00:39:03	Just like a pair of earrings-- identical.	N
649	00:39:04	00:39:06	So you were at Tony's house the morning he died.	Y
650	00:39:06	00:39:11	Along with Walt Braun whose prints we confirmed on the doggy door.	N
651	00:39:31	00:39:39	You know, sometimes, doing the job that we do our biggest break comes from the most innocent circumstance.	N
652	00:39:39	00:39:43	It was the maid's day off, but not the gardener's.	N
653	00:39:43	00:39:47	That's the thing about murder you never think to have a backup plan.	N
654	00:39:47	00:39:50	The dogs lead him right to you...	N
655	00:39:51	00:39:53	so you had to wing it.	Y
656	00:39:57	00:40:00	The gardener came to the window...	N
657	00:40:02	00:40:04	but he didn't see you...	Y
658	00:40:04	00:40:07	so you removed the tape from Tony's wrists...	Y
659	00:40:07	00:40:09	and made it look like an OD.	N
660	00:40:09	00:40:16	What I don't get is you and Walt Braun didn't move in the same circles.	Y
661	00:40:16	00:40:18	How'd the two of you hook up?	Y
662	00:40:24	00:40:27	Can't make a deal if you keep your mouth shut.	N
663	00:40:35	00:40:42	He could never give advice but he had a million stories.	Y
664	00:40:42	00:40:44	Scorpion and the Frog.	Y
665	00:40:44	00:40:50	Scorpion needed to get across the creek and asked the frog for a ride.	N
666	00:40:51	00:40:55	Frog says, I can't trust you, you're a scorpion.	Y
667	00:40:55	00:40:58	Scorpion says, Sure you can.	N
668	00:40:58	00:41:00	Hops on the frog's back.	N
669	00:41:02	00:41:06	Midway across, the scorpion stings the frog.	N
670	00:41:06	00:41:10	Frog looks at him.	Y
671	00:41:10	00:41:13	Why would you do that?	Y
672	00:41:13	00:41:15	Now we're both gonna die.	N
673	00:41:18	00:41:20	Scorpion says...	N
674	00:41:23	00:41:27	I can't help it. I'm a scorpion.	N
675	00:41:29	00:41:34	If Tony hadn't thrown a party...	N
676	00:41:34	00:41:37	the two of us would never have been standing at that bar.	N
677	00:41:37	00:41:39	Hey, Janine, you're lookin' good.	N
678	00:41:52	00:41:54	You're looking at my brother's trophy?	N
679	00:41:54	00:41:57	No, my husband's bimbo.	N
680	00:41:57	00:41:59	Walt Braun.	N
681	00:42:00	00:42:02	Bonnie Ritten.	N
682	00:42:03	00:42:07	And an opportunity presented itself.	N
683	00:42:08	00:42:14	Tony had erased you from the will and Bonnie wanted the people that hurt her to pay.	N
684	00:42:16	00:42:18	Ain't love grand?	N
685	00:42:24	00:42:27	You know, this... this could've all been his.	N
686	00:42:27	00:42:29	His and Tony's.	N
687	00:42:30	00:42:31	It's not your fault.	N
688	00:42:31	00:42:33	Sure it is.	N
689	00:42:35	00:42:38	I committed the cardinal sin.	N
690	00:42:38	00:42:41	I loved one son more than the other.	N
691	00:42:41	00:42:44	It's human nature.	N
692	00:42:44	00:42:46	We can't deny our feelings.	N
693	00:42:46	00:42:49	But you can hide it.	N
694	00:42:49	00:42:51	And I didn't.	N
695	00:42:51	00:42:54	And my sons...	N
696	00:42:54	00:42:57	I made them, I raised them...	N
697	00:42:57	00:43:00	and one kills the other.	N
698	00:43:00	00:43:04	Hey, Sam... you still got me.	N
699	00:43:06	00:43:08	You know, I should've married your mother.	N
700	00:43:08	00:43:13	Well, considering I was six months old when you guys lit the flame...	N
701	00:43:13	00:43:15	a lot of time has passed.	N
702	00:43:15	00:43:17	You had plenty of chances.	N
703	00:43:19	00:43:21	Just wasn't in the cards, Catherine.	N
704	00:43:24	00:43:27	It just wasn't in the cards.	N
