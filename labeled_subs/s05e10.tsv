0	0	0	00:00:08	00:00:12	So, the Gang Unit says our d.b. is a 16-year-old Tyson Plummer.	N
1	1	1	00:00:12	00:00:13	How many holes in the victim?	N
2	2	2	00:00:13	00:00:15	I count four.	N
3	3	3	00:00:15	00:00:17	11 shell casings.	N
4	4	4	00:00:17	00:00:21	Shooter emptied the gun-- so he was moving and shooting.	N
5	5	5	00:00:21	00:00:23	Only hit the vic four times.	N
6	6	6	00:00:23	00:00:25	She talks to herself.	N
7	7	7	00:00:25	00:00:27	Hey, it works for me.	N
8	8	8	00:00:27	00:00:32	Bullets that missed hit the outside building wall.	N
9	9	9	00:00:34	00:00:37	Bang, bang, bang, bang.	N
10	10	10	00:00:37	00:00:40	Man, Andre didn't cap him like that.	N
11	11	11	00:00:40	00:00:42	Did too.	N
12	12	12	00:00:42	00:00:43	How you gonna tell me? I saw him...	N
13	13	13	00:00:43	00:00:45	Hey, guys, can I talk to you for a sec?	N
14	14	14	00:00:45	00:00:47	I just want to ask you a few questions.	N
15	15	15	00:01:03	00:01:05	Grissom...	N
16	16	16	00:01:05	00:01:06	Go ahead, Greg.	N
17	17	17	00:01:06	00:01:09	We got a very young male d.b.	N
18	18	18	00:01:09	00:01:11	by the Dumpster.	N
19	19	19	00:01:11	00:01:12	I'll be right there.	N
20	20	20	00:01:17	00:01:19	Get your damn hands off me!	N
21	21	21	00:01:19	00:01:20	Whoa, whoa.	N
22	22	22	00:01:21	00:01:22	I can't let you touch him.	N
23	23	23	00:01:22	00:01:23	What's your name?	N
24	24	24	00:01:25	00:01:26	I'm Plummer. Leo.	N
25	25	25	00:01:26	00:01:28	That's my brother right there.	N
26	26	26	00:01:28	00:01:31	They didn't have to do him like that, dawg.	N
27	27	27	00:01:31	00:01:33	I know you know who did this, Leo.	N
28	28	28	00:01:33	00:01:34	Ain't your problem, man.	N
29	29	29	00:01:35	00:01:37	Whoever did this is gonna get got.	N
30	30	30	00:01:37	00:01:38	Oh, no, don't say stuff like that.	N
31	31	31	00:01:39	00:01:42	you in shackles or you on a slab.	N
32	32	32	00:01:42	00:01:44	So, let's break the odds this time. What do you say?	N
33	33	33	00:01:44	00:01:46	You done with me, bacon?	N
34	34	34	00:01:46	00:01:49	'Cause I got family to go bury.	N
35	35	35	00:02:05	00:02:06	You okay?	N
36	36	36	00:02:06	00:02:08	Hell no, I'm not okay.	N
37	37	37	00:02:08	00:02:10	Who the hell's shooting at us?	N
38	38	38	00:02:10	00:02:15	I don't know, but I think our single just turned into a triple.	N
39	39	39	00:03:03	00:03:07	Somebody tried to just throw him out with the trash.	N
40	40	40	00:03:07	00:03:11	If the Dumpster wasn't full he would've ended up at the landfill.	N
41	41	41	00:03:13	00:03:15	He hasn't been dead long.	N
42	42	42	00:03:15	00:03:19	He's just coming out of rigor, so I'd say less than 24 hours.	N
43	43	43	00:03:19	00:03:26	He wasn't in the box long enough to mummify, but the kid looks like an ad for hunger relief.	N
44	44	44	00:03:26	00:03:30	Okay, let's, um, transport him in situ.	N
45	45	45	00:03:30	00:03:33	Be very careful moving the body.	N
46	46	46	00:03:33	00:03:35	You okay?	N
47	47	47	00:03:37	00:03:39	Yeah. Fine.	N
48	48	48	00:03:40	00:03:41	Let me go, dawg! Let me go, man!	N
49	49	49	00:03:41	00:03:42	Get off me, man!	N
50	50	50	00:03:42	00:03:44	That's Rodney King, dawg! Let me...	N
51	51	51	00:03:44	00:03:48	Get off! Get off me! Get off! Get off me!	N
52	52	52	00:03:49	00:03:51	So, uh...	N
53	53	53	00:03:51	00:03:55	you think these concerned citizens are taping the capture of a vicious killer?	N
54	54	54	00:03:55	00:04:00	If they're taping now, maybe they caught that second shooting on video.	N
55	55	55	00:04:00	00:04:02	Maybe you could collect the cameras.	N
56	56	56	00:04:03	00:04:05	I love this guy.	N
57	57	57	00:04:09	00:04:11	It says forensics on our jacket.	N
58	58	58	00:04:11	00:04:13	I'm aware of that.	N
59	59	59	00:04:13	00:04:15	We had plenty of cops chasing the suspect.	N
60	60	60	00:04:15	00:04:18	I wasn't chasing the suspect.	N
61	61	61	00:04:18	00:04:19	I was chasing the evidence.	N
62	62	62	00:04:19	00:04:22	I knew the idiot was likely to dump the gun.	N
63	63	63	00:04:22	00:04:26	All we have to do is ballistics-match the weapon to both victims.	N
64	64	64	00:04:27	00:04:29	Case closed.	N
65	65	65	00:04:35	00:04:36	Hey.	N
66	66	66	00:04:36	00:04:37	Hey, man.	N
67	67	67	00:04:37	00:04:38	What's up?	N
68	68	68	00:04:40	00:04:44	Suspects wait in Central Holding to be processed and transferred to jail.	N
69	69	69	00:04:44	00:04:48	They assaulted the officers with feces and then the cops went in.	N
70	70	70	00:04:48	00:04:49	Great.	N
71	71	71	00:04:49	00:04:51	To bust some heads.	N
72	72	72	00:04:51	00:04:54	Hoo...	N
73	73	73	00:04:54	00:04:59	So, you've got a Samuel Mendez with a cracked skull listed as death imminent, right?	N
74	74	74	00:04:59	00:05:01	Yeah. It's why they kicked it up to Homicide.	N
75	75	75	00:05:01	00:05:04	You think the cops used excessive force here?	N
76	76	76	00:05:04	00:05:06	Well, if they did it's mitigating circumstances.	N
77	77	77	00:05:06	00:05:08	Yeah.	N
78	78	78	00:05:09	00:05:13	Yeah, well, if they'd've thrown a bunch of feces at me, I would have cracked some skulls too.	N
79	79	79	00:05:17	00:05:20	This is the last place I thought I'd see a gun.	N
80	80	80	00:05:20	00:05:22	It was found under the victim.	N
81	81	81	00:05:23	00:05:25	Arresting officer must have done a lousy search.	N
82	82	82	00:05:33	00:05:34	Wow...	N
83	83	83	00:05:35	00:05:36	this is a lot of crap.	N
84	84	84	00:05:36	00:05:37	What, did they squat on cue?	N
85	85	85	00:05:37	00:05:40	Overflowing toilet.	N
86	86	86	00:05:40	00:05:42	There's enough ammunition right there.	N
87	87	87	00:05:42	00:05:47	So, the cops bust in to get the prisoners under control when they start throwing raw sewage?	N
88	88	88	00:05:51	00:05:54	Well, there must have been some real bad asses in here.	N
89	89	89	00:05:54	00:05:56	Look like it got pretty heated.	N
90	90	90	00:06:00	00:06:02	You want to tell me what happened here?	N
91	91	91	00:06:02	00:06:04	Cops iced the kid.	N
92	92	92	00:06:04	00:06:05	What else you want to know?	N
93	93	93	00:06:05	00:06:08	Could tell he was a fish from the jump, though.	N
94	94	94	00:06:08	00:06:09	A fish?	N
95	95	95	00:06:09	00:06:10	New to the game.	N
96	96	96	00:06:17	00:06:18	What?	N
97	97	97	00:06:20	00:06:21	You see what happened?	N
98	98	98	00:06:21	00:06:23	The po-po gutted the fish.	N
99	99	99	00:06:23	00:06:24	I saw the whole thing.	N
100	100	100	00:06:24	00:06:25	Same thing they did to me.	N
101	101	101	00:06:25	00:06:27	Two beatings in one day.	N
102	102	102	00:06:27	00:06:29	Rodney King, yo.	N
103	103	103	00:06:46	00:06:48	I'm sorry, uh, who are you?	N
104	104	104	00:06:48	00:06:50	I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the crime lab.	N
105	105	105	00:06:50	00:06:53	Oh. I'm Dr. Franks, attending.	N
106	106	106	00:06:54	00:06:56	Have you located his family yet?	N
107	107	107	00:06:56	00:07:00	No. I need to find someone to sign a release, take him off the ventilator.	N
108	108	108	00:07:00	00:07:02	He's brain dead?	N
109	109	109	00:07:02	00:07:03	Oh, yeah.	N
110	110	110	00:07:03	00:07:05	I'm hoping the family will donate his organs.	N
111	111	111	00:07:05	00:07:07	Tell me about his injuries.	N
112	112	112	00:07:07	00:07:12	He's got blunt-force trauma to the frontal and sphenoid bones.	N
113	113	113	00:07:14	00:07:20	It fragmented his skull, damaged his temporal arteries and imbedded in his brain.	N
114	114	114	00:07:24	00:07:31	Well, those are shoe prints on his face, which suggests that he was attacked while he was down.	N
115	115	115	00:07:33	00:07:35	Well, he came from County lock-up.	N
116	116	116	00:07:35	00:07:37	Must have been a hell of a fight.	N
117	117	117	00:08:57	00:09:00	The victim's about five years old.	N
118	118	118	00:09:01	00:09:04	He was just losing his baby teeth.	N
119	119	119	00:09:04	00:09:09	X rays show metaphyseal fractures to the right humerus and acromion.	N
120	120	120	00:09:09	00:09:12	They're called corner or bucket-handle fractures.	N
121	121	121	00:09:12	00:09:14	Shake the baby?	N
122	122	122	00:09:14	00:09:16	It's more like snatch and shake.	N
123	123	123	00:09:16	00:09:21	Violent shaking creates shearing forces causing fragment fractures at the end of the growth plate.	N
124	124	124	00:09:21	00:09:25	It's highly specific for abuse.	N
125	125	125	00:09:28	00:09:30	How old do you think these fractures are?	N
126	126	126	00:09:31	00:09:36	Well, this kind of fracture doesn't usually heal with callus you can easily see.	N
127	127	127	00:09:36	00:09:39	My guess, less than six months.	N
128	128	128	00:09:41	00:09:43	He is emaciated.	N
129	129	129	00:09:43	00:09:45	He looks drawn.	N
130	130	130	00:09:45	00:09:47	The only thing missing is a swollen belly.	N
131	131	131	00:09:47	00:09:49	It's called cachexia.	N
132	132	132	00:09:49	00:09:52	The soft tissue is diminished and drawn around the skull.	N
133	133	133	00:09:53	00:09:57	The eyes are sunken, and there's prominent tenting where the skin should retract.	N
134	134	134	00:09:57	00:10:01	His ribs are poking through his skin.	N
135	135	135	00:10:01	00:10:04	He starved to death, didn't he?	N
136	136	136	00:10:04	00:10:07	C.O.D. is renal failure due to starvation.	N
137	137	137	00:10:07	00:10:13	His intestinal tract was virtually empty, except for these brown flecks I found.	N
138	138	138	00:10:13	00:10:16	Hepatic steatosis, the liver goes yellow and greasy.	N
139	139	139	00:10:16	00:10:24	Ketoacidosis, fat stores are used for energy, and then rhabdomyolysis-- when muscle is broken down for fuel.	N
140	140	140	00:10:24	00:10:27	Think of the body as digesting itself.	N
141	141	141	00:10:37	00:10:39	This took weeks.	N
142	142	142	00:10:39	00:10:44	I have to admit, this seems especially cruel and unusual.	N
143	143	143	00:10:44	00:10:46	When kids are involved, it usually is.	N
144	144	144	00:10:50	00:10:52	It's a 10-by-18-foot cell built for 25 people.	N
145	145	145	00:10:52	00:10:54	We've got 35 mutts and no place to put the extras.	N
146	146	146	00:10:54	00:10:58	Between the yo's, the cholos and the rednecks, it was bound to happen.	N
147	147	147	00:10:58	00:11:01	35 guys, that's a lot of men to fit in one room.	N
148	148	148	00:11:01	00:11:02	Cops round them up, we process them.	N
149	149	149	00:11:02	00:11:05	It usually doesn't take long, but today we got jammed.	N
150	150	150	00:11:05	00:11:06	What was the problem?	N
151	151	151	00:11:07	00:11:08	Computer went down, plumbing backed up.	N
152	152	152	00:11:09	00:11:10	You name it, we had it.	N
153	153	153	00:11:10	00:11:11	Any rival bangers in the same cell?	N
154	154	154	00:11:11	00:11:17	No. I rechecked the roster. We don't want the yo's killing each other in custody.	N
155	155	155	00:11:17	00:11:19	Why we bother, I'll never know.	N
156	156	156	00:11:19	00:11:24	You ever think an overcrowded cell mixed with bad plumbing was the reason they threw the contents?	N
157	157	157	00:11:24	00:11:25	They don't need a reason.	N
158	158	158	00:11:25	00:11:27	Bad monkeys at the zoo.	N
159	159	159	00:11:31	00:11:34	So, uh, how did the gun get past security?	N
160	160	160	00:11:34	00:11:36	Arresting officer did a bad search.	N
161	161	161	00:11:36	00:11:38	Don't you search them again when they get to the holding cell?	N
162	162	162	00:11:38	00:11:39	What?	N
163	163	163	00:11:40	00:11:42	Don't you search them again when they get here?	N
164	164	164	00:11:42	00:11:44	Is there something you want to get off your chest?	N
165	165	165	00:11:45	00:11:48	A gun in a cell is sloppy police work, man.	N
166	166	166	00:11:51	00:11:54	I don't like what you're implying about me or my men.	N
167	167	167	00:11:54	00:11:57	Then maybe you need to dial down your attitude.	N
168	168	168	00:11:57	00:11:59	A man is brain dead here!	N
169	169	169	00:11:59	00:12:03	I don't care what he was like when he was alive, and neither should you, don't you think?	N
170	170	170	00:12:03	00:12:06	All I know, there's one less bastard I gotta watch my back for.	N
171	171	171	00:12:06	00:12:08	There's five of us, so the odds are in their favor.	N
172	172	172	00:12:08	00:12:10	You're a crime scene tech.	N
173	173	173	00:12:10	00:12:14	I'm law enforcement, which means you don't get to tell me what to do in my jail.	N
174	174	174	00:12:14	00:12:17	If I find out you used excessive force on an unarmed prisoner, you won't have a jail.	N
175	175	175	00:12:18	00:12:18	I think we're done here.	N
176	176	176	00:12:19	00:12:19	I don't think so.	N
177	177	177	00:12:20	00:12:25	Not quite. I'm going to need your armor, your shields, your boots and your batons. Right now!	N
178	178	178	00:12:35	00:12:40	I, uh... ran John Doe minor's DNA against the Missing Persons database.	N
179	179	179	00:12:41	00:12:42	I'm sorry, no hits.	N
180	180	180	00:12:42	00:12:44	Yeah, I'm not surprised.	N
181	181	181	00:12:44	00:12:48	They didn't care enough to feed him, why would they report him missing?	N
182	182	182	00:12:51	00:12:52	What's going on in here?	N
183	183	183	00:12:52	00:12:55	The victim had a prior abuse fracture.	N
184	184	184	00:12:55	00:12:58	And you're hoping Child Protective Services investigated?	N
185	185	185	00:12:58	00:13:03	Well, based on the age of the victim, the age of the fracture and the break pattern, I found ten possible matches.	N
186	186	186	00:13:03	00:13:08	Well, it's going to take you forever to go through these alone.	N
187	187	187	00:13:10	00:13:12	I'll get it done.	N
188	188	188	00:13:12	00:13:16	It took me a long time to get where I was, Sara.	N
189	189	189	00:13:16	00:13:20	Now I feel like I'm starting from scratch.	N
190	190	190	00:13:20	00:13:21	I miss sleeping at night.	N
191	191	191	00:13:21	00:13:23	I miss my colleagues.	N
192	192	192	00:13:23	00:13:24	I miss...	N
193	193	193	00:13:24	00:13:26	What?	N
194	194	194	00:13:26	00:13:28	Being trusted.	N
195	195	195	00:13:34	00:13:36	What's on the menu today, Warrick?	N
196	196	196	00:13:36	00:13:37	A gun...	N
197	197	197	00:13:37	00:13:42	face shields, vests... batons...	N
198	198	198	00:13:42	00:13:44	Please run the batons first.	N
199	199	199	00:13:44	00:13:45	Why? You thinking bad cop?	N
200	200	200	00:13:45	00:13:49	Well, the batons were the only weapons inside of the cell.	N
201	201	201	00:13:49	00:13:50	Everything else was fixed...	N
202	202	202	00:13:51	00:13:53	...to the floor, to the walls.	N
203	203	203	00:13:54	00:13:56	You gonna get that?	N
204	204	204	00:13:58	00:13:59	No.	N
205	205	205	00:13:59	00:14:00	Player.	N
206	206	206	00:14:00	00:14:02	Oh, now I'm a player.	N
207	207	207	00:14:02	00:14:05	You make up your mind pretty quick.	N
208	208	208	00:14:05	00:14:07	I'll, uh, page you when I get the results.	N
209	209	209	00:14:07	00:14:08	Yeah?	N
210	210	210	00:14:12	00:14:15	He was a rough one last night, so I called to check on him.	N
211	211	211	00:14:15	00:14:19	But since I'm here, I can do it in person.	N
212	212	212	00:14:19	00:14:20	Anything else you want to say to me?	N
213	213	213	00:14:21	00:14:22	Have a nice day.	N
214	214	214	00:14:22	00:14:23	Is that it?	N
215	215	215	00:14:23	00:14:24	That's it.	N
216	216	216	00:14:25	00:14:27	Am I interrupting?	N
217	217	217	00:14:27	00:14:29	No.	N
218	218	218	00:14:29	00:14:30	No.	N
219	219	219	00:14:32	00:14:34	Good day.	N
220	220	220	00:14:36	00:14:37	He's pretty hot.	N
221	221	221	00:14:37	00:14:40	Yeah, well, I think he knows it.	N
222	222	222	00:14:40	00:14:43	Anything on the hairs from the plastic coffin?	N
223	223	223	00:14:43	00:14:49	Ah, yeah, I actually did find one hair with a root tag still attached, and it's a priority run for me as soon as I get something to compare it to.	N
224	224	224	00:14:49	00:14:51	Sara also collected a bunch synthetic hairs.	N
225	225	225	00:14:51	00:14:54	I'm thinking doll, wig, maybe fake fur.	N
226	226	226	00:14:54	00:14:55	I sent them over to Trace.	N
227	227	227	00:15:00	00:15:06	I went through child abuse cases, looking for a match to the victim's age and fracture.	N
228	228	228	00:15:06	00:15:09	I pulled the X rays of our most likely candidates.	N
229	229	229	00:15:09	00:15:13	Sinus identification is as reliable as fingerprints.	N
230	230	230	00:15:13	00:15:17	Sinuses are unique; they have distinct, scalloped edges.	N
231	231	231	00:15:21	00:15:23	No match.	N
232	232	232	00:15:23	00:15:29	It's harder to identify children this way because they, uh, develop so quickly.	N
233	233	233	00:15:37	00:15:39	This is it.	N
234	234	234	00:15:39	00:15:40	Bingo.	N
235	235	235	00:15:40	00:15:44	Yep. Frontal and ethmoid sinuses line up perfectly.	N
236	236	236	00:15:46	00:15:53	Devon Malton, age five, last known residence was a foster home run by a Lorna Tenney.	N
237	237	237	00:15:53	00:15:55	So, which one of my kids is in trouble?	N
238	238	238	00:15:55	00:15:58	No, you are, Mrs. Tenney.	N
239	239	239	00:15:58	00:16:01	Oh? Which one of my kids lodged a complaint?	N
240	240	240	00:16:01	00:16:02	That happen a lot?	N
241	241	241	00:16:02	00:16:04	Well, it goes with the territory.	N
242	242	242	00:16:04	00:16:07	We're here about, uh, Devon Malton.	N
243	243	243	00:16:07	00:16:08	Well, he hasn't lived here in six months.	N
244	244	244	00:16:08	00:16:11	Since he fractured his arm?	N
245	245	245	00:16:11	00:16:13	CPS investigated. They cleared me.	N
246	246	246	00:16:13	00:16:15	Records show Devon resides here.	N
247	247	247	00:16:15	00:16:16	Well, records are wrong.	N
248	248	248	00:16:16	00:16:18	Mind if we come in and take a look around?	N
249	249	249	00:16:18	00:16:20	I do.	N
250	250	250	00:16:20	00:16:21	If you've got nothing to hide...	N
251	251	251	00:16:21	00:16:23	Oh, save it.	N
252	252	252	00:16:23	00:16:24	Those mind games don't work on me.	N
253	253	253	00:16:24	00:16:30	I deal with the police often enough to know better than to talk to you without my attorney or to let you poke around my things.	N
254	254	254	00:16:30	00:16:32	Look, Family Services says you have this kid.	N
255	255	255	00:16:32	00:16:33	Mm-hmm. They've issued aid checks.	N
256	256	256	00:16:33	00:16:35	Now, who do you expect me to believe?	N
257	257	257	00:16:35	00:16:37	The checks come, I send them back.	N
258	258	258	00:16:37	00:16:38	I've got the copies to prove it.	N
259	259	259	00:16:38	00:16:41	Look, it's either here or at the station.	N
260	260	260	00:16:41	00:16:42	So, you choose.	N
261	261	261	00:16:42	00:16:46	Then let's go, because you don't set foot in my house without a warrant.	N
262	262	262	00:17:26	00:17:30	Heard you had a real sphincter pucker last night.	N
263	263	263	00:17:30	00:17:31	So what kind of gun are you getting?	N
264	264	264	00:17:31	00:17:33	Plenty of guns at crime scenes.	N
265	265	265	00:17:33	00:17:35	Cops have them, some criminalists...	N
266	266	266	00:17:35	00:17:37	Yeah, cops make great targets.	N
267	267	267	00:17:37	00:17:41	Plus, CSIs get shot at all the time, or didn't they tell you?	N
268	268	268	00:17:41	00:17:44	If this is why you paged me, then I...	N
269	269	269	00:17:44	00:17:46	I got the results on the bin contents.	N
270	270	270	00:17:48	00:17:50	Well?	N
271	271	271	00:17:50	00:17:51	Are you sure you're okay?	N
272	272	272	00:17:51	00:17:53	You don't look so good.	N
273	273	273	00:17:55	00:18:03	I detected mineral oil, titanium dioxide, stearic acid, isopropylpalpitate using polarized lightmicroscopy, GCMS and FTIR.	N
274	274	274	00:18:03	00:18:05	Is that makeup?	N
275	275	275	00:18:05	00:18:07	Burnt sienna foundation.	N
276	276	276	00:18:07	00:18:09	The cheap stuff.	N
277	277	277	00:18:09	00:18:11	What about the intestinal tract contents?	N
278	278	278	00:18:11	00:18:14	Lead-based paint chips...	N
279	279	279	00:18:15	00:18:17	last used in 1978.	N
280	280	280	00:18:17	00:18:19	That whole neighborhood looks like it was built in the '70s.	N
281	281	281	00:18:20	00:18:23	Could've come from any one of the apartment buildings or the houses.	N
282	282	282	00:18:23	00:18:27	Which means that sooner or later, you're going to have to be going back out to the hood.	N
283	283	283	00:18:27	00:18:28	Nervous?	N
284	284	284	00:18:29	00:18:30	Hmm...	N
285	285	285	00:18:31	00:18:33	I'm sorry, Doctor.	N
286	286	286	00:18:33	00:18:35	I can't donate his organs.	N
287	287	287	00:18:35	00:18:38	I assure you your son has no brain activity, Mr. Mendez.	N
288	288	288	00:18:38	00:18:40	He's gone.	N
289	289	289	00:18:40	00:18:41	No, no, you don't understand.	N
290	290	290	00:18:41	00:18:44	I don't know who that is in there, but it's not my son.	N
291	291	291	00:18:44	00:18:46	Mr. Mendez.	N
292	292	292	00:18:48	00:18:51	I'm Catherine Willows, with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
293	293	293	00:18:51	00:18:52	Are you sure?	N
294	294	294	00:18:52	00:18:56	I've been waiting for this phone call a long time.	N
295	295	295	00:18:56	00:19:04	My kid took a wrong turn somewhere-- maybe it's my fault, I don't know-- but somebody's boy is in that bed and he's not mine.	N
296	296	296	00:19:10	00:19:14	Either he can't accept reality or the County made a big mistake.	N
297	297	297	00:19:14	00:19:16	Well, there's only one way to find out.	N
298	298	298	00:19:16	00:19:18	I'll have to take his prints.	N
299	299	299	00:20:05	00:20:06	Guys.	N
300	300	300	00:20:07	00:20:08	Do your work.	N
301	301	301	00:20:19	00:20:20	Hi.	N
302	302	302	00:20:28	00:20:31	You like chemistry?	N
303	303	303	00:20:31	00:20:35	No. I'm not smart enough.	N
304	304	304	00:20:35	00:20:36	Sure you are.	N
305	305	305	00:20:36	00:20:39	Glynnis, right?	N
306	306	306	00:20:42	00:20:43	Quantum theory.	N
307	307	307	00:20:43	00:20:46	That's compelling stuff actually.	N
308	308	308	00:20:46	00:20:50	Look, you can question me, fine.	N
309	309	309	00:20:50	00:20:53	You don't have to pretend to be interested in me.	N
310	310	310	00:20:53	00:20:56	I'm sorry, that was lame.	N
311	311	311	00:20:56	00:21:00	I guess I was just trying to put you at ease.	N
312	312	312	00:21:00	00:21:02	I know what it's like.	N
313	313	313	00:21:02	00:21:04	What?	N
314	314	314	00:21:04	00:21:06	Living with strangers.	N
315	315	315	00:21:06	00:21:10	Your fate being decided by social workers, advocates, judges...	N
316	316	316	00:21:10	00:21:12	You were in the system.	N
317	317	317	00:21:13	00:21:15	For a while.	N
318	318	318	00:21:15	00:21:20	I've been in foster care for ten years.	N
319	319	319	00:21:21	00:21:24	I moved from one home to the next.	N
320	320	320	00:21:24	00:21:27	Believe me, Mrs. Tenney is one of the good ones.	N
321	321	321	00:21:32	00:21:35	She's not very cooperative.	N
322	322	322	00:21:35	00:21:37	She's been burned a lot.	N
323	323	323	00:21:37	00:21:43	Look, I know she comes off as tough, but she really cares.	N
324	324	324	00:21:43	00:21:49	Enough to tell us the truth, even if it hurts.	N
325	325	325	00:21:49	00:21:51	You remember a little boy named Devon?	N
326	326	326	00:21:51	00:21:53	Yeah. Cute kid.	N
327	327	327	00:21:54	00:21:55	About five years old.	N
328	328	328	00:21:55	00:21:58	Your foster mom said that Devon left months ago.	N
329	329	329	00:21:58	00:21:59	Is that true?	N
330	330	330	00:21:59	00:22:01	Yeah.	N
331	331	331	00:22:01	00:22:04	Why all the questions?	N
332	332	332	00:22:06	00:22:08	Did something happen?	N
333	333	333	00:22:08	00:22:10	Yeah.	N
334	334	334	00:22:12	00:22:14	Is he dead?	N
335	335	335	00:22:16	00:22:18	Yeah.	N
336	336	336	00:22:21	00:22:23	I don't understand.	N
337	337	337	00:22:24	00:22:28	His mom came and picked him up.	N
338	338	338	00:22:28	00:22:32	That never happens.	N
339	339	339	00:22:32	00:22:35	You could just see how much she loved those boys.	N
340	340	340	00:22:35	00:22:38	Glynnis...	N
341	341	341	00:22:38	00:22:41	did Devon have brothers at the foster home?	N
342	342	342	00:22:41	00:22:43	Yeah.	N
343	343	343	00:22:43	00:22:47	Two older brothers, Kevin and, and Raymond.	N
344	344	344	00:22:49	00:22:51	What happened to them?	N
345	345	345	00:22:54	00:23:01	The boys' mother, Candace Malton, served 47 of a 90-day sentence for smashing a brick into her abusive boyfriend's face.	N
346	346	346	00:23:01	00:23:03	Sounds like self-defense to me.	N
347	347	347	00:23:03	00:23:05	Yeah, if she would've walked after the first hit.	N
348	348	348	00:23:05	00:23:07	So, how many times did she actually hit him?	N
349	349	349	00:23:07	00:23:13	Five. It takes battered women a while to see the light, but once they do, there's no going back.	N
350	350	350	00:23:13	00:23:17	Okay, so the Malton boys were placed in foster care while Mom served her sentence.	N
351	351	351	00:23:17	00:23:21	A single mother, she reinstated her parental rights as soon as she got out of jail.	N
352	352	352	00:23:21	00:23:25	After what happened to her son, she didn't want to have anything to do with Child Services.	N
353	353	353	00:23:25	00:23:26	Any idea where the mother is now?	N
354	354	354	00:23:26	00:23:28	No.	N
355	355	355	00:23:28	00:23:31	I've already checked welfare, Medicaid, HUD rolls-- she's in the wind.	N
356	356	356	00:23:33	00:23:34	I'll put out a BOLO.	N
357	357	357	00:23:34	00:23:35	No offense, but...	N
358	358	358	00:23:36	00:23:40	why didn't you check in to the kids' welfare after the mom was released from jail?	N
359	359	359	00:23:40	00:23:44	8,000 child abuse/neglect investigations a year.	N
360	360	360	00:23:44	00:23:46	There's only so much we can do.	N
361	361	361	00:23:46	00:23:51	Look, despite her taste in men, in my opinion, Candace Malton was a good mother.	N
362	362	362	00:23:52	00:23:55	One of her sons is dead, and the other two are missing.	N
363	363	363	00:23:56	00:23:59	What's good about that?	N
364	364	364	00:24:02	00:24:04	Hey, Mia.	N
365	365	365	00:24:04	00:24:05	Have you finished processing the batons?	N
366	366	366	00:24:05	00:24:07	Yeah, just now.	N
367	367	367	00:24:07	00:24:11	I found blood, epithelials and hair on all of them.	N
368	368	368	00:24:11	00:24:14	There are several DNA sources from everyone but the victim.	N
369	369	369	00:24:14	00:24:18	Which means that a police baton never connected with Sam Mendez.	N
370	370	370	00:24:18	00:24:22	He had to already be down when the cops entered the cell.	N
371	371	371	00:24:22	00:24:23	Thanks.	N
372	372	372	00:24:24	00:24:26	Catherine Willows?	N
373	373	373	00:24:26	00:24:30	Yeah. Lieutenant Arthur Chan, watch commander for Central Holding.	N
374	374	374	00:24:30	00:24:38	We are almost finished with our investigation, but I can tell you that the victim's prints don't match the Sam Mendez that's wanted for murder.	N
375	375	375	00:24:38	00:24:40	You telling me we arrested the wrong guy?	N
376	376	376	00:24:40	00:24:43	It was a routine traffic stop.	N
377	377	377	00:24:43	00:24:47	The arresting officer ran the name and got an immediate warrant hit.	N
378	378	378	00:24:48	00:24:51	An arrest warrant for murder and...	N
379	379	379	00:24:51	00:24:52	two guys with the same name.	N
380	380	380	00:24:52	00:24:53	Out of the car!	N
381	381	381	00:24:53	00:24:55	What did I do? Walk back. Hands up.	N
382	382	382	00:24:55	00:24:58	The arresting officer did his job; I did my job.	N
383	383	383	00:24:58	00:24:59	No one's saying that you didn't.	N
384	384	384	00:24:59	00:25:01	Your subordinate Warrick Brown did.	N
385	385	385	00:25:01	00:25:05	With all due respect, Lieutenant, that really doesn't sound like the Warrick Brown I know.	N
386	386	386	00:25:05	00:25:08	You're a civilian, but even you understand chain of command.	N
387	387	387	00:25:09	00:25:12	Now, I'm giving you an opportunity to adjust his attitude.	N
388	388	388	00:25:12	00:25:15	Don't make me.	N
389	389	389	00:25:18	00:25:21	Heard you found a print on the bin.	N
390	390	390	00:25:21	00:25:23	Yeah, I did. Under the lip curve.	N
391	391	391	00:25:27	00:25:28	What?	N
392	392	392	00:25:28	00:25:31	Well, I'm not sure of the best way to process the print.	N
393	393	393	00:25:31	00:25:32	You take digital photos?	N
394	394	394	00:25:32	00:25:34	Yeah. Well, hand them over.	N
395	395	395	00:25:34	00:25:38	I'll load it into the computer, reconstruct the image while you finish processing.	N
396	396	396	00:25:38	00:25:42	Well, what else is there left to do but run it through AFIS?	N
397	397	397	00:25:42	00:25:45	You're gonna need an actual print for court.	N
398	398	398	00:25:45	00:25:50	Are you saying that I have to cut it out in order to lift it?	N
399	399	399	00:25:50	00:25:52	Isn't that destroying the evidence? No.	N
400	400	400	00:25:52	00:25:53	You're recovering it.	N
401	401	401	00:25:53	00:25:55	As long as you document it, you're fine.	N
402	402	402	00:25:55	00:25:56	Oh.	N
403	403	403	00:26:36	00:26:38	Well, I appreciate your help.	N
404	404	404	00:26:38	00:26:40	No big deal.	N
405	405	405	00:26:40	00:26:44	I don't know if I'd be quite as accommodating after just being...	N
406	406	406	00:26:45	00:26:47	Well, you know.	N
407	407	407	00:26:47	00:26:48	Demoted?	N
408	408	408	00:26:48	00:26:49	Yeah.	N
409	409	409	00:26:51	00:26:52	No hit in AFIS.	N
410	410	410	00:26:52	00:26:54	I've widened the search.	N
411	411	411	00:26:54	00:26:56	I've got an FBI database hit.	N
412	412	412	00:26:56	00:27:00	Your print belongs to an enlisted man.	N
413	413	413	00:27:00	00:27:02	Private First Class Philip Riley.	N
414	414	414	00:27:02	00:27:05	I hope you can tell me what the hell's going on.	N
415	415	415	00:27:05	00:27:07	M.P.'s just dragged me off a transport to Tikrit.	N
416	416	416	00:27:07	00:27:09	That makes me look bad. Not that I mind.	N
417	417	417	00:27:09	00:27:11	Better here than over there, you know what I'm saying?	N
418	418	418	00:27:11	00:27:13	Well, you're an American hero.	N
419	419	419	00:27:13	00:27:15	And I mean that, you all are.	N
420	420	420	00:27:16	00:27:17	What the hell were you doing on D Street?	N
421	421	421	00:27:18	00:27:24	D Street? Explain to me why your fingerprints ended up on a plastic bin container in an alley off D Street.	N
422	422	422	00:27:24	00:27:26	Oh, come on!	N
423	423	423	00:27:26	00:27:30	Oh. Did I forget to mention there was a dead kid inside?	N
424	424	424	00:27:31	00:27:36	Whoa, I thought this was about paying for trim inside county lines.	N
425	425	425	00:27:36	00:27:38	All I did was take out the trash.	N
426	426	426	00:27:38	00:27:39	That's all I did.	N
427	427	427	00:27:39	00:27:41	For who?	N
428	428	428	00:27:41	00:27:42	Some chickenhead ghetto rat.	N
429	429	429	00:27:42	00:27:46	Uh... I was shipping out, and-and I decided to party, you know?	N
430	430	430	00:27:46	00:27:48	She was all I could afford.	N
431	431	431	00:27:48	00:27:49	Where'd you meet her?	N
432	432	432	00:27:49	00:27:52	Some dive. The Seven Sins.	N
433	433	433	00:27:52	00:27:53	What was her name?	N
434	434	434	00:27:53	00:27:55	Devine. I think.	N
435	435	435	00:27:55	00:27:58	I don't remember if she told me her last name.	N
436	436	436	00:27:58	00:28:02	Anyway, we had some fun, and when I was done, she told me to take out the trash.	N
437	437	437	00:28:02	00:28:04	End of story.	N
438	438	438	00:28:04	00:28:05	Not quite.	N
439	439	439	00:28:05	00:28:06	Where does she live?	N
440	440	440	00:28:06	00:28:08	North Vegas somewhere.	N
441	441	441	00:28:08	00:28:10	I was drunk as hell.	N
442	442	442	00:28:10	00:28:12	I want you to think real hard.	N
443	443	443	00:28:12	00:28:15	I-I swear to God, I don't know.	N
444	444	444	00:28:15	00:28:16	I really don't.	N
445	445	445	00:28:16	00:28:18	How'd you get there?	N
446	446	446	00:28:18	00:28:19	In a taxi.	N
447	447	447	00:28:19	00:28:22	And I left the same damn way.	N
448	448	448	00:28:29	00:28:32	Ah, looks good on you.	N
449	449	449	00:28:32	00:28:35	Thanks.	N
450	450	450	00:28:35	00:28:37	Have a seat.	N
451	451	451	00:28:39	00:28:42	So, what's up?	N
452	452	452	00:28:42	00:28:45	Lieutenant Chan dropped by.	N
453	453	453	00:28:45	00:28:48	Really?	N
454	454	454	00:28:48	00:28:49	I wonder what for.	N
455	455	455	00:28:49	00:28:52	To complain about you.	N
456	456	456	00:28:52	00:28:54	Wish you told me you'd had a beef with him.	N
457	457	457	00:28:54	00:28:56	There was nothing to say.	N
458	458	458	00:28:56	00:28:58	We had words, it got heated, then it was over.	N
459	459	459	00:28:58	00:29:00	Well... ( clears throat )	N
460	460	460	00:29:00	00:29:02	I'm the supervisor of the swing shift.	N
461	461	461	00:29:02	00:29:04	I'm responsible for the whole team.	N
462	462	462	00:29:04	00:29:09	It's my job to make sure that we remain objective and professional.	N
463	463	463	00:29:09	00:29:12	Yeah, I really don't see what the big deal is.	N
464	464	464	00:29:12	00:29:14	I mean, I remember talking to Grissom...	N
465	465	465	00:29:14	00:29:16	Well, I'm not Grissom.	N
466	466	466	00:29:16	00:29:19	He let a lot of things slide that I won't.	N
467	467	467	00:29:19	00:29:20	Okay.	N
468	468	468	00:29:20	00:29:22	Is there anything else?	N
469	469	469	00:29:22	00:29:25	The evidence cleared the extraction team.	N
470	470	470	00:29:25	00:29:28	You owe Lieutenant Chan an apology.	N
471	471	471	00:29:28	00:29:29	Written or verbal?	N
472	472	472	00:29:30	00:29:33	From now on, anything that happens at a crime scene, I'm your first phone call.	N
473	473	473	00:29:33	00:29:35	Sure.	N
474	474	474	00:30:44	00:30:46	Fire in the hole! Shooting two!	N
475	475	475	00:31:09	00:31:15	We now know the cops were not responsible, so that leaves us with 34 suspects, all with rap sheets.	N
476	476	476	00:31:15	00:31:17	Is there anything to narrow the focus?	N
477	477	477	00:31:17	00:31:23	Well, I compared all 34 pairs-- I came up with one sole pattern...	N
478	478	478	00:31:23	00:31:26	and one suspect-- Vincent Mendoza...	N
479	479	479	00:31:26	00:31:29	booked for meth manufacture.	N
480	480	480	00:31:29	00:31:34	Well, the official C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head, not stomping.	N
481	481	481	00:31:34	00:31:38	Well, it's not unreasonable to think the same guy that caused the blunt force trauma can also stomp him.	N
482	482	482	00:31:38	00:31:41	Well, that all sounds good, but why go to all that trouble?	N
483	483	483	00:31:41	00:31:43	Because the gun was hot.	N
484	484	484	00:31:43	00:31:45	Ran it though IBIS.	N
485	485	485	00:31:45	00:31:47	It was used in an execution-style murder.	N
486	486	486	00:31:47	00:31:51	The last thing the guy wanted to do was to get caught with a gun that had a body on it.	N
487	487	487	00:31:51	00:31:55	Yeah, well, this victim looks like the perfect patsy to drop a gun on.	N
488	488	488	00:31:56	00:31:58	Yeah...	N
489	489	489	00:31:58	00:32:02	little fish in a tank full of sharks.	N
490	490	490	00:32:04	00:32:05	What's on the table, gentlemen?	N
491	491	491	00:32:05	00:32:07	Murder, two counts.	N
492	492	492	00:32:07	00:32:12	Your client killed a man in a holding cell and tried to frame the cops for it.	N
493	493	493	00:32:12	00:32:13	That's bull and you know it.	N
494	494	494	00:32:13	00:32:15	Shh.	N
495	495	495	00:32:15	00:32:18	Let's hear the corroborating evidence, and it'd better be good.	N
496	496	496	00:32:18	00:32:20	Mr. Mendoza was hooked in a raid on a meth lab.	N
497	497	497	00:32:21	00:32:24	Problem was, he was carrying a concealed weapon and had no time to ditch it.	N
498	498	498	00:32:24	00:32:31	He dropped the weapon down his pants, planned to get rid of it in central holding before the cavity search.	N
499	499	499	00:32:31	00:32:34	So far, I'm not hearing anything you can actually prove.	N
500	500	500	00:32:34	00:32:39	Well, I'm sure Vincent here knew a lot of people inside since he is a repeat offender.	N
501	501	501	00:32:39	00:32:41	But only one man didn't fit, huh?	N
502	502	502	00:32:41	00:32:45	Fear must've been rolling off him in waves so strong you could probably smell it.	N
503	503	503	00:32:58	00:33:00	What you looking at, huh?	N
504	504	504	00:33:00	00:33:01	Nothing. Nothing.	N
505	505	505	00:33:03	00:33:05	I said, what're you looking at, mark?	N
506	506	506	00:33:05	00:33:07	Nothing.	N
507	507	507	00:33:17	00:33:19	911! 911, man!	N
508	508	508	00:33:24	00:33:26	Typical.	N
509	509	509	00:33:26	00:33:28	Knew you guys would try to pin this on me.	N
510	510	510	00:33:28	00:33:30	I wasn't anywhere near the fish.	N
511	511	511	00:33:30	00:33:32	You sure about that?	N
512	512	512	00:33:32	00:33:34	That's what I said, isn't it?	N
513	513	513	00:33:34	00:33:38	Well, it's good to know, since your boot prints were found on the victim's head.	N
514	514	514	00:33:39	00:33:43	See, you didn't want to get caught with a gun used in another homicide.	N
515	515	515	00:33:43	00:33:48	A meth dealer, your partner, was found in the desert two weeks ago.	N
516	516	516	00:33:48	00:33:52	Any one of those guys could've carried a gun into the holding cell.	N
517	517	517	00:33:52	00:33:58	It's not likely, unless you can explain how Vincent here got his pubic hair and feces caught in the gun's hammer.	N
518	518	518	00:34:01	00:34:03	Give us some time.	N
519	519	519	00:34:05	00:34:07	How's 25 to life sound?	N
520	520	520	00:34:23	00:34:26	$40 buys the lips, a hundy gets you south.	N
521	521	521	00:34:26	00:34:27	Goes double for around the world.	N
522	522	522	00:34:27	00:34:29	You got a car?	N
523	523	523	00:34:29	00:34:30	You sure about that? Mm-hmm.	N
524	524	524	00:34:30	00:34:32	'Cause you don't look like you got a car to me.	N
525	525	525	00:34:32	00:34:34	Take a hike, John. I'm her next appointment.	N
526	526	526	00:34:36	00:34:39	I didn't do nothing but sit here, Officer.	N
527	527	527	00:34:39	00:34:40	On your feet.	N
528	528	528	00:34:41	00:34:43	Can't believe you're gonna ruin my day for this.	N
529	529	529	00:34:43	00:34:45	You don't have enough to charge me with solicitation.	N
530	530	530	00:34:45	00:34:47	Hey! Watch it, bitch.	N
531	531	531	00:34:47	00:34:49	It's a wig, hair is consistent.	N
532	532	532	00:34:49	00:34:52	Could you open your mouth for me, please?	N
533	533	533	00:34:52	00:34:54	Come on, you can do that in your sleep, honey.	N
534	534	534	00:34:54	00:34:56	Open up or we'll have to stick you with a needle.	N
535	535	535	00:35:08	00:35:09	Taking your pet for a walk?	N
536	536	536	00:35:09	00:35:15	I know how much you like my little fetal pig, so I'm giving him to you as an office-warming gift.	N
537	537	537	00:35:15	00:35:18	That is so thoughtful.	N
538	538	538	00:35:20	00:35:22	Now tell me why you really stopped by.	N
539	539	539	00:35:22	00:35:24	You checking up on me?	N
540	540	540	00:35:24	00:35:25	No.	N
541	541	541	00:35:25	00:35:28	What've you heard?	N
542	542	542	00:35:28	00:35:29	Who talked to you?	N
543	543	543	00:35:29	00:35:30	See?	N
544	544	544	00:35:30	00:35:33	You've been on the job for a week and you're already paranoid.	N
545	545	545	00:35:37	00:35:45	When I was your right-hand and your left, I always knew that if it hit the fan, that you'd be the one to get dirty.	N
546	546	546	00:35:45	00:35:47	Hey, that's the job.	N
547	547	547	00:35:47	00:35:50	Yeah, that's the job.	N
548	548	548	00:35:52	00:35:54	Did you ever play politics?	N
549	549	549	00:35:54	00:36:00	I once ran for president of the science club in junior high.	N
550	550	550	00:36:00	00:36:03	Mary Hardy beat me out by one vote.	N
551	551	551	00:36:03	00:36:07	I'm going to guess that you didn't vote for yourself.	N
552	552	552	00:36:10	00:36:12	I'm not any good at politics.	N
553	553	553	00:36:13	00:36:15	And it's cost me.	N
554	554	554	00:36:15	00:36:17	It's how I lost Nick and Warrick.	N
555	555	555	00:36:17	00:36:21	Your loss was my gain.	N
556	556	556	00:36:21	00:36:24	Yeah.	N
557	557	557	00:36:24	00:36:27	And at least they're in good hands.	N
558	558	558	00:36:27	00:36:32	We been sitting here a long-ass time.	N
559	559	559	00:36:32	00:36:34	What can I say, I like your company.	N
560	560	560	00:36:35	00:36:38	What'd you bring me down here for?	N
561	561	561	00:36:38	00:36:40	I was only trying to make a few bucks.	N
562	562	562	00:36:40	00:36:42	Yeah.	N
563	563	563	00:36:45	00:36:47	DNA's a match.	N
564	564	564	00:36:49	00:36:50	Match to what?	N
565	565	565	00:36:50	00:36:53	To one of your hairs that you left on the body of a little boy.	N
566	566	566	00:36:53	00:36:55	I don't know what you're talking about.	N
567	567	567	00:36:55	00:36:56	No?	N
568	568	568	00:36:56	00:37:00	I wonder why anyone would leave one kid with you much less three.	N
569	569	569	00:37:00	00:37:03	You have seven ileals in common with the dead boy.	N
570	570	570	00:37:03	00:37:06	Although that's not enough to say you're related, it's certainly enough to keep digging.	N
571	571	571	00:37:06	00:37:10	You know, I ran your wants and warrants.	N
572	572	572	00:37:10	00:37:11	It kicked out some aliases.	N
573	573	573	00:37:13	00:37:15	I mean, Devine's a street name.	N
574	574	574	00:37:15	00:37:20	But you're also known as Darlene Lewis, married briefly to a grifter.	N
575	575	575	00:37:20	00:37:26	And a.k.a. Darlene Malton.	N
576	576	576	00:37:27	00:37:29	Hey, that's the same last name as the victim.	N
577	577	577	00:37:29	00:37:38	To starve anyone is beyond me, but to do it to a child... a relative, is unforgivable.	N
578	578	578	00:37:48	00:37:51	Wasn't even like that.	N
579	579	579	00:37:51	00:37:54	My half-sister Candy left me with them bad-ass kids and no money.	N
580	580	580	00:37:54	00:37:56	How am I supposed to feed them?	N
581	581	581	00:37:56	00:37:58	You don't look like you've missed any meals to me.	N
582	582	582	00:37:58	00:37:59	Know what, skinny bitch, go to hell.	N
583	583	583	00:37:59	00:38:00	I just scrape by.	N
584	584	584	00:38:00	00:38:04	If you couldn't take care of them, why didn't you just turn them over to Social Services?	N
585	585	585	00:38:04	00:38:06	I promised I wouldn't.	N
586	586	586	00:38:06	00:38:08	Little D got hurt last time.	N
587	587	587	00:38:08	00:38:10	She would've killed me.	N
588	588	588	00:38:10	00:38:13	What's she going to do when she finds out her son is dead?	N
589	589	589	00:38:13	00:38:15	I did the best I could.	N
590	590	590	00:38:16	00:38:18	Okay, where are the boys now?	N
591	591	591	00:38:21	00:38:25	Uh-uh, you're not gonna blame this on me.	N
592	592	592	00:38:25	00:38:26	I want a lawyer.	N
593	593	593	00:38:26	00:38:31	You can have a lawyer after you give me the address.	N
594	594	594	00:38:31	00:38:37	But let me tell you something-- if those boys die, I'm going to make it my business to see you get the death penalty.	N
595	595	595	00:38:47	00:38:48	There's no one in the house.	N
596	596	596	00:38:48	00:38:50	Where are the kids?	N
597	597	597	00:38:50	00:38:52	I don't know, let's check around back.	N
598	598	598	00:38:52	00:38:56	So, turns out that Mom was sending money after all.	N
599	599	599	00:38:56	00:39:01	I found this letter inside mailed from Seattle with 300 bucks in it for the kids' upkeep.	N
600	600	600	00:39:01	00:39:04	And that skanky bitch used it to buy a new TV.	N
601	601	601	00:39:47	00:39:49	Paint chips.	N
602	602	602	00:39:49	00:39:51	Smells like a toilet.	N
603	603	603	00:39:58	00:40:01	Yeah, she never let them upstairs.	N
604	604	604	00:40:01	00:40:04	Kevin, Raymond...	N
605	605	605	00:40:04	00:40:05	Oh, no.	N
606	606	606	00:40:05	00:40:07	I'm going to call an ambulance.	N
607	607	607	00:40:11	00:40:13	He's alive!	N
608	608	608	00:40:13	00:40:15	We need water and blankets.	N
609	609	609	00:40:15	00:40:18	Oh, my gosh.	N
610	610	610	00:40:20	00:40:23	Hey. Are you Kevin or Raymond?	N
611	611	611	00:40:23	00:40:26	It's all right.	N
612	612	612	00:40:26	00:40:30	It's all right, you're safe now.	N
613	613	613	00:40:30	00:40:32	It's okay.	N
614	614	614	00:40:43	00:40:47	So, Seattle P.D. has located Candace Malton.	N
615	615	615	00:40:47	00:40:49	They're putting her on a plane tonight.	N
616	616	616	00:40:49	00:40:51	They said she's pretty broken up.	N
617	617	617	00:40:51	00:40:54	She left her kids with her hooker cousin.	N
618	618	618	00:40:54	00:40:56	She should've known better.	N
619	619	619	00:40:57	00:41:00	Where are you going to take her first, the hospital or the morgue?	N
620	620	620	00:41:00	00:41:02	Guess I might as well get it over with.	N
621	621	621	00:41:02	00:41:05	I mean, once she sees the kids she's not going to want to leave them.	N
622	622	622	00:41:09	00:41:10	What do you think?	N
623	623	623	00:41:10	00:41:14	Go with the living, Jim.	N
624	624	624	00:41:14	00:41:16	The dead can wait.	N
