0	00:00:20	00:00:21	Hi.	N
1	00:00:21	00:00:22	Hey.	N
2	00:00:22	00:00:25	Husband and wife got into it.	N
3	00:00:25	00:00:26	Hmm.	N
4	00:00:26	00:00:27	Hmm.	N
5	00:00:27	00:00:28	What set them off?	N
6	00:00:28	00:00:30	She caught him with a hooker in their bed.	N
7	00:00:30	00:00:31	She cut him.	N
8	00:00:31	00:00:33	He killed her.	N
9	00:00:33	00:00:34	What about the hooker?	N
10	00:00:34	00:00:36	She grabbed his wallet and took off.	N
11	00:00:36	00:00:38	I caught the guy just sitting on a curb.	N
12	00:00:38	00:00:39	I swabbed his hands for blood spatter.	N
13	00:00:39	00:00:42	I am super backed up.	N
14	00:00:42	00:00:43	Can this wait till tomorrow?	N
15	00:00:43	00:00:45	He's not going anywhere.	N
16	00:00:45	00:00:48	Thanks, Mia.	N
17	00:00:48	00:00:49	Yeah...	N
18	00:00:49	00:00:51	Oh, hey, guys.	N
19	00:00:51	00:00:52	I could really use a drink.	N
20	00:00:52	00:00:54	You want to join me? I'm buying.	N
21	00:00:54	00:00:56	I'd love a drink, but we made plans, though?	N
22	00:00:56	00:00:57	You did?	N
23	00:00:57	00:00:58	Tomorrow. Rain check.	N
24	00:00:58	00:00:59	All right.	N
25	00:00:59	00:01:01	Rain check.	N
26	00:01:01	00:01:03	Okay.	N
27	00:01:15	00:01:17	No way you were never married.	N
28	00:01:17	00:01:18	Oh, let me guess.	N
29	00:01:18	00:01:26	You were young, he seemed more mature than he really was, he swept you off your feet, and, uh, he let you fall.	N
30	00:01:26	00:01:29	Bruised, but not broken.	N
31	00:01:29	00:01:31	Get you another one?	N
32	00:01:31	00:01:34	No, I'm good, thanks.	N
33	00:01:35	00:01:37	So you're divorced?	N
34	00:01:41	00:01:43	You?	N
35	00:01:43	00:01:44	Yeah.	N
36	00:01:44	00:01:47	She seemed more mature than she really was, swept me off my feet.	N
37	00:01:48	00:01:49	Kids?	N
38	00:01:49	00:01:53	Uh, yes, I have a daughter.	N
39	00:01:53	00:01:56	If she's got her mother's looks, you're in trouble.	N
40	00:02:06	00:02:08	If I don't get home soon, I will be in trouble.	N
41	00:02:12	00:02:13	Thanks. I needed this.	N
42	00:02:14	00:02:16	If you're blowing me off, no worries.	N
43	00:02:16	00:02:18	But if you're not...	N
44	00:02:23	00:02:24	...give me a call.	N
45	00:02:30	00:02:31	Wait a second.	N
46	00:02:31	00:02:33	Let me walk you to your car.	N
47	00:02:44	00:02:46	I can't do this tonight. I...	N
48	00:02:46	00:02:48	I'll call you.	N
49	00:02:49	00:02:51	What the hell is your problem?	N
50	00:02:56	00:02:58	Go to hell.	N
51	00:03:04	00:03:06	You're not worth the trouble.	N
52	00:03:25	00:03:28	Hello.	N
53	00:03:28	00:03:31	Mom, Mom.	N
54	00:03:31	00:03:32	Grissom just called. I've got to go in.	N
55	00:03:33	00:03:34	I'm backing up grave.	N
56	00:03:34	00:03:35	( sniffs ) What?	N
57	00:03:35	00:03:38	Vodka, with an Altoid chaser.	N
58	00:03:38	00:03:40	I brushed my teeth.	N
59	00:03:40	00:03:44	What did you do, walk into a door?	N
60	00:03:44	00:03:48	Hey, listen, Lindsey's got a dentist appointment before school.	N
61	00:03:48	00:03:50	I wrote all the information down in the kitchen.	N
62	00:03:50	00:03:52	Okay. Okay?	N
63	00:03:52	00:03:53	Thank you.	N
64	00:03:53	00:03:55	Oh, good grief.	N
65	00:04:15	00:04:17	I appreciate this.	N
66	00:04:17	00:04:18	Everyone's out.	N
67	00:04:18	00:04:19	I'm short.	N
68	00:04:19	00:04:22	You're welcome.	N
69	00:04:24	00:04:26	Clotted blood hasn't retracted yet.	N
70	00:04:26	00:04:28	She hasn't been dead long.	N
71	00:04:28	00:04:29	We have an I.D.?	N
72	00:04:29	00:04:32	Yeah, building manager took a peek.	N
73	00:04:32	00:04:34	ID'd her as Alice Granger.	N
74	00:04:34	00:04:35	Apartment 207.	N
75	00:04:35	00:04:37	Moved here about a month ago.	N
76	00:04:37	00:04:41	David, you want to take the, uh, jacket off her face?	N
77	00:04:54	00:04:55	What happened to you?	N
78	00:04:55	00:04:57	I walked into a door.	N
79	00:04:57	00:04:59	Can we not talk about it?	N
80	00:05:01	00:05:02	Gunshot.	N
81	00:05:03	00:05:05	Looks like a small caliber weapon.	N
82	00:05:07	00:05:09	No cartridge casings.	N
83	00:05:10	00:05:12	No purse, no car.	N
84	00:05:12	00:05:13	I put out a BOLO.	N
85	00:05:13	00:05:14	Possible car jacking.	N
86	00:05:23	00:05:27	Usually when a killer covers the victim's face, it suggests familiarity.	N
87	00:05:27	00:05:29	An act of contrition.	N
88	00:05:33	00:05:35	Maybe she knew her attacker.	Y
89	00:05:35	00:05:38	Great. Carjacked by a friend.	N
90	00:05:39	00:05:42	Vartann.	N
91	00:05:42	00:05:43	Yeah, got it.	N
92	00:05:43	00:05:45	We got a 20 on her car.	N
93	00:05:45	00:05:48	You go, I'll stay with the body, I'll meet you there.	N
94	00:06:11	00:06:12	You see anybody get out of the car?	N
95	00:06:12	00:06:14	No, sir. Saw it on patrol.	N
96	00:06:14	00:06:16	You checked the bar? I waited for you.	N
97	00:06:16	00:06:17	No one's exited since we got here.	N
98	00:06:17	00:06:19	Okay, I'll see you inside.	N
99	00:06:23	00:06:25	Can you open it up?	N
100	00:06:34	00:06:36	Thank you.	N
101	00:06:52	00:06:55	I found a gun under the seat.	N
102	00:06:56	00:06:59	.22 Beretta.	N
103	00:06:59	00:07:01	Well, that's small enough to be the weapon.	N
104	00:07:01	00:07:06	So he shoots her, takes her car, and stops off for a drink.	Y
105	00:07:06	00:07:07	He could still be in there.	Y
106	00:07:09	00:07:11	Let's find out.	N
107	00:07:14	00:07:18	Did you hear the one about the cop and the monkey who walk into a bar?	N
108	00:07:18	00:07:20	I'm not in the mood.	N
109	00:07:20	00:07:22	Neither was the monkey.	N
110	00:08:16	00:08:18	Except for the Saturn, all the cars in the lot are accounted for.	N
111	00:08:18	00:08:20	Okay.	N
112	00:08:22	00:08:23	Hi. You recognize this girl?	N
113	00:08:24	00:08:27	Yeah. She's been in a few times. How about last night?	N
114	00:08:27	00:08:28	Yeah.	N
115	00:08:29	00:08:31	Throwing them back pretty good, too.	N
116	00:08:31	00:08:32	You see anybody hassle her?	N
117	00:08:32	00:08:34	She was getting a lot of attention.	N
118	00:08:34	00:08:36	She didn't really seem to mind.	N
119	00:08:36	00:08:38	Did you see her leave with anyone?	N
120	00:08:38	00:08:39	No. She was wasted.	N
121	00:08:39	00:08:41	Had me call her a cab.	N
122	00:08:41	00:08:42	Around what time?	N
123	00:08:42	00:08:43	We were really slammed.	N
124	00:08:43	00:08:47	00... 2 Which cab company?	N
125	00:08:47	00:08:48	Lucky Cab.	N
126	00:08:48	00:08:50	Well, that would explain why her car's still here.	N
127	00:08:50	00:08:51	Doesn't explain the gun.	N
128	00:08:56	00:08:57	Thank you.	N
129	00:08:57	00:08:59	Why? Do I know you?	N
130	00:09:00	00:09:04	I dug it out of the right frontal cortex.	N
131	00:09:04	00:09:08	The bullet lacerated the right occipital lobe.	N
132	00:09:09	00:09:16	It crossed the mid-line, destroying the vital structures of the brain and bounced off the left frontal calvarium.	N
133	00:09:16	00:09:18	Hmm.	N
134	00:09:18	00:09:21	This is a .25 caliber.	N
135	00:09:21	00:09:22	What, disappointed?	N
136	00:09:22	00:09:24	We found a .22 in the victim's car.	N
137	00:09:24	00:09:26	This just ruled that out as the murder weapon.	N
138	00:09:26	00:09:27	So shoot me.	N
139	00:09:27	00:09:31	Stellate tear means close contact.	N
140	00:09:31	00:09:34	See the muzzle impression around the entrance wound?	N
141	00:09:38	00:09:40	This could help identify the firearm.	N
142	00:09:45	00:09:48	This is an unusual point of entry.	N
143	00:09:48	00:09:49	Yeah, I measured the trajectory.	N
144	00:09:49	00:09:51	Ten to 15 degrees left of vertical.	N
145	00:09:51	00:09:53	Shooter would have to be standing over her.	Y
146	00:09:53	00:09:56	Which would make him a giant, except for this.	Y
147	00:09:57	00:09:59	Abrasions on her knees.	N
148	00:10:02	00:10:05	So... maybe she was kneeling.	N
149	00:10:05	00:10:08	Begging for her life.	N
150	00:10:09	00:10:14	So, Judge Wilson tells me I'd have better luck with a blue suit than a gray suit.	N
151	00:10:14	00:10:16	What is that? Do you think he meant that?	N
152	00:10:16	00:10:19	Do you think he was flirting with me or...?	N
153	00:10:19	00:10:21	I thought judges were supposed to be color blind.	N
154	00:10:21	00:10:22	Yeah, right.	N
155	00:10:22	00:10:24	That's cute.	N
156	00:10:31	00:10:34	I found some particulate on the jacket.	N
157	00:10:34	00:10:35	Not sure what it is.	N
158	00:10:35	00:10:36	I'll get it to Hodges.	N
159	00:10:38	00:10:42	credit card, car keys, lipstick and one matchbook.	N
160	00:10:45	00:10:46	Can I see that?	N
161	00:10:46	00:10:48	There's no name, just a phone number.	N
162	00:10:50	00:10:52	Give me a call.	N
163	00:10:54	00:10:55	I'll have Vartann run it down.	N
164	00:10:57	00:11:00	You know, I've got to go pick up Lindsey.	N
165	00:11:00	00:11:01	Could you cover for me?	N
166	00:11:01	00:11:02	Sure.	N
167	00:11:02	00:11:03	Thanks.	N
168	00:11:03	00:11:05	Tell her I said, Hey.	N
169	00:11:23	00:11:25	Lindsey!	N
170	00:11:25	00:11:26	Yeah.	N
171	00:11:26	00:11:27	What happened to the trash?	N
172	00:11:27	00:11:29	I took it out, like you always tell me to.	N
173	00:11:29	00:11:31	It's Thursday.	N
174	00:11:31	00:11:32	Uh, hello, Mom, you okay?	N
175	00:11:32	00:11:34	Yeah, I'm great.	N
176	00:11:34	00:11:36	Are you sure about that?	N
177	00:11:36	00:11:39	You want me to be the babysitter, but you want me to be deaf and blind, too?	N
178	00:11:39	00:11:41	Can't get into this now, Mother.	N
179	00:11:41	00:11:43	I'm in a jam. You haven't seen your daughter all week.	N
180	00:11:43	00:11:45	Save the sermon.	N
181	00:11:45	00:11:47	I was a working mother, too, you know?	N
182	00:11:47	00:11:50	There but for the grace of God...	N
183	00:11:50	00:11:55	Don't just assume that my time means nothing to me.	N
184	00:11:55	00:11:56	Damn it. Catherine?	N
185	00:11:56	00:11:57	I threw something away. It's gone.	N
186	00:11:57	00:12:00	( cell phone rings ) You're throwing more than you know away.	N
187	00:12:04	00:12:05	Yeah?	N
188	00:12:06	00:12:08	Uh...	N
189	00:12:08	00:12:09	Yeah, just wait till I get there.	N
190	00:12:09	00:12:12	Yeah.	N
191	00:12:12	00:12:15	Mom... Go. Go.	N
192	00:12:15	00:12:18	I'll be here when you get back.	N
193	00:12:35	00:12:37	Results from Alice Granger's jacket.	N
194	00:12:37	00:12:40	Found trace elements of iron, chromium, manganese and carbon.	N
195	00:12:40	00:12:41	Metals.	N
196	00:12:41	00:12:43	More specific, automotive sheet metal.	N
197	00:12:43	00:12:47	The metallic balls would've been released into the air during the welding process.	N
198	00:12:50	00:12:52	So you're saying our killer has metal balls?	Y
199	00:12:52	00:12:55	Yes... maybe.	N
200	00:12:55	00:13:01	Turns out that the victim worked in a car dealership, so she could've gotten metal balls on the job.	N
201	00:13:01	00:13:07	And just in case you're wondering, working here, I'm developing them, too.	N
202	00:13:15	00:13:16	Yo.	N
203	00:13:16	00:13:18	Oh. What do you have for me?	N
204	00:13:18	00:13:22	Bullet is a .25 auto caliber Winchester full metal jacket.	N
205	00:13:22	00:13:25	You can't shoot .25s from a .22 caliber pistol.	N
206	00:13:25	00:13:26	I know.	N
207	00:13:26	00:13:30	Which means the semi-automatic you found in Alice Granger's car isn't the murder weapon.	N
208	00:13:30	00:13:31	I know.	N
209	00:13:31	00:13:35	Okay, well, did you know that the gun is registered to a Douglas Granger?	N
210	00:13:46	00:13:49	I don't understand why you're asking me this.	N
211	00:13:49	00:13:51	I'm her brother, not her husband.	N
212	00:13:51	00:13:53	You still own a lot of guns.	N
213	00:13:53	00:13:56	A .22 pistol, Colt .25, among others.	N
214	00:13:56	00:13:58	That's right.	N
215	00:13:58	00:14:00	We found the .22 in Alice's car.	N
216	00:14:02	00:14:06	If she carried it in her purse instead of leaving it in the car, she might still be alive.	N
217	00:14:08	00:14:09	I don't follow.	N
218	00:14:09	00:14:11	I gave her the gun last week.	N
219	00:14:11	00:14:12	Then what?	N
220	00:14:12	00:14:13	You shot her with your .25?	N
221	00:14:13	00:14:14	Are you insane?	N
222	00:14:14	00:14:18	It's no mystery who killed her.	N
223	00:14:18	00:14:21	Jeff Simon, her ex-boyfriend. Guy was stalking her.	Y
224	00:14:21	00:14:26	She changed her phone number, changed jobs, moved a half dozen times.	N
225	00:14:26	00:14:28	No matter where she went, there he was.	Y
226	00:14:28	00:14:30	Last week, I was over at her new apartment.	N
227	00:14:30	00:14:33	Jerk sitting in his car, in front of the building.	Y
228	00:14:33	00:14:35	Is that when you gave her the gun?	N
229	00:14:36	00:14:38	Taught her how to shoot it.	N
230	00:14:38	00:14:40	Helped her get a restraining order.	N
231	00:14:40	00:14:42	Got zero help from you guys.	N
232	00:14:42	00:14:45	Catch him in the act. That's all we heard.	Y
233	00:14:45	00:14:46	You know where we can find Jeff Simon?	Y
234	00:14:46	00:14:49	Yeah.	N
235	00:14:49	00:14:50	We used to be friends.	N
236	00:15:11	00:15:13	Hey, I'm looking for Jeff Simon.	Y
237	00:15:23	00:15:24	Jeff Simon?	Y
238	00:15:25	00:15:26	Are you Jeff Simon?	Y
239	00:15:26	00:15:27	Yeah.	N
240	00:15:30	00:15:32	When's the last time you saw Alice Granger?	Y
241	00:15:32	00:15:33	Before the restraining order kicked in.	N
242	00:15:33	00:15:35	Come on.	N
243	00:15:35	00:15:37	This is just a big misunderstanding, Officer.	N
244	00:15:37	00:15:38	Well, I'm glad you feel that way.	Y
245	00:15:38	00:15:40	You mind if we take a look in your truck?	Y
246	00:15:40	00:15:42	What did Alice say I did now?	Y
247	00:15:42	00:15:43	Where is it?	N
248	00:15:49	00:15:51	I don't get a break for another half hour.	Y
249	00:15:51	00:15:53	Look, we can get a court order.	N
250	00:15:55	00:15:57	You can look anywhere you want.	N
251	00:15:57	00:16:00	Just give Alice a message for me.	Y
252	00:16:00	00:16:02	I love her, and I want her back.	Y
253	00:16:06	00:16:08	Look, buddy, she's dead.	Y
254	00:16:23	00:16:27	What the...	N
255	00:16:27	00:16:30	I swear, I haven't been...	Y
256	00:16:30	00:16:33	I haven't been anywhere near her since her brother broke us up.	Y
257	00:16:35	00:16:37	I'm gonna check out his truck.	Y
258	00:17:33	00:17:41	Gil, the suspect has a laptop in his vehicle that has a GPS unit that's honed in on the lab.	Y
259	00:17:41	00:17:44	Well, you can't track a static location.	N
260	00:17:44	00:17:46	It has to be something mobile.	N
261	00:17:46	00:17:48	I know. That's why I'm calling.	N
262	00:18:35	00:18:36	Yeah.	N
263	00:18:36	00:18:37	You were right.	N
264	00:18:37	00:18:41	We found a GPS transmitter under the rear bumper of the girl's car.	N
265	00:18:41	00:18:43	Thanks.	N
266	00:18:46	00:18:48	He was tracking her car.	Y
267	00:18:49	00:18:50	Let's bring him in.	Y
268	00:18:52	00:18:53	Get up.	N
269	00:19:00	00:19:01	You are a real prize.	Y
270	00:19:01	00:19:06	Jeff, your prints are all over that box, which means one count felony stalking.	Y
271	00:19:06	00:19:08	That's seven to ten.	N
272	00:19:08	00:19:11	Murder two adds a quarter.	N
273	00:19:11	00:19:15	Now, you plead out now, you'll live to see parole.	Y
274	00:19:15	00:19:16	I didn't kill Alice.	Y
275	00:19:16	00:19:18	I loved her.	Y
276	00:19:18	00:19:19	Is that your idea of love?	Y
277	00:19:19	00:19:21	Stalking her with a GPS unit?	N
278	00:19:21	00:19:23	I wasn't stalking her.	Y
279	00:19:23	00:19:24	I wo-worried about her.	Y
280	00:19:24	00:19:27	So that restraining order she filed against you was because you're a nice guy.	Y
281	00:19:27	00:19:30	Let me tell you about Alice.	Y
282	00:19:30	00:19:32	She... liked to party...	N
283	00:19:35	00:19:43	...barely ate, hardly slept, didn't want to admit she had a drinking problem.	N
284	00:19:44	00:19:47	She needed me to look out for her.	Y
285	00:19:47	00:19:50	Well, there's a problem with your story. She called a cab.	Y
286	00:19:50	00:19:55	I'm telling you, Alice got into a Chrysler or... a Buick?	N
287	00:19:55	00:19:57	It was blue, maybe black.	N
288	00:19:57	00:20:02	And the guy she was with, maniac driver. Complete moron.	N
289	00:20:02	00:20:04	Wait, wait. You... you followed them?	Y
290	00:20:06	00:20:08	I had to.	Y
291	00:20:08	00:20:12	But I was pulled over by the cops.	Y
292	00:20:12	00:20:16	They kept me on-on the side of the road for over an hour.	Y
293	00:20:17	00:20:18	What time was this?	N
294	00:20:18	00:20:19	00.	N
295	00:20:19	00:20:20	It was a buck-fifty ticket.	N
296	00:20:20	00:20:21	I'm innocent.	Y
297	00:20:22	00:20:23	Cut the crap.	N
298	00:20:23	00:20:26	We found trace amounts of automotive sheet metal on her clothing.	N
299	00:20:26	00:20:27	You work around cars.	Y
300	00:20:27	00:20:30	If Alice picked it up from you, you were in violation of the T.R.O.	Y
301	00:20:30	00:20:33	Lady, until we broke up, we spent every waking minute together.	Y
302	00:20:33	00:20:36	She'd come over to my shop on her lunch break just to get some.	Y
303	00:20:36	00:20:38	It was over, Jeff.	Y
304	00:20:38	00:20:40	She didn't want you to be her lover, her protector.	Y
305	00:20:40	00:20:43	She didn't want you within a hundred yards.	Y
306	00:20:43	00:20:45	Whatever trace from you we found on her was fresh.	Y
307	00:20:45	00:20:47	She worked around cars, too.	N
308	00:20:47	00:20:50	I'm telling you, I'm innocent!	Y
309	00:20:50	00:20:53	You were living a fantasy, thinking you still had a chance.	Y
310	00:20:53	00:20:55	When reality set in, you killed her.	Y
311	00:20:55	00:20:58	I only did one thing wrong.	Y
312	00:20:59	00:21:02	I didn't protect her from that guy.	Y
313	00:21:02	00:21:04	What did this guy look like?	N
314	00:21:04	00:21:06	Sleazy bastard.	N
315	00:21:06	00:21:08	Slight build, dark hair.	N
316	00:21:08	00:21:11	I think he had a leather jacket.	Y
317	00:21:30	00:21:31	Okay.	N
318	00:21:31	00:21:32	Do you have a minute?	N
319	00:21:32	00:21:34	I got a problem in DNA.	N
320	00:21:34	00:21:37	Okay, uh, it really is only gonna take a minute.	N
321	00:21:37	00:21:40	Um, I just need to have a conversation with you.	N
322	00:21:42	00:21:46	I processed the swabs from the wife who found her husband in the hooker case.	N
323	00:21:46	00:21:47	Right.	N
324	00:21:47	00:21:49	Two contributions.	N
325	00:21:49	00:21:50	Two?	N
326	00:21:50	00:21:52	One was a match to the wife's DNA.	N
327	00:21:52	00:21:54	The other was from an unknown male.	N
328	00:21:54	00:21:58	I found the same unknown male contribution on the swabs from the Alice Granger homicide.	N
329	00:21:58	00:22:00	Well, it's unlikely that they're connected. They're not.	N
330	00:22:00	00:22:04	I also matched that unknown male contribution to a rape kit from the day shift.	N
331	00:22:04	00:22:05	Cross contamination?	N
332	00:22:05	00:22:07	That's why I raised the alarm.	N
333	00:22:07	00:22:10	I was able to narrow the time frame to the last 48 hours.	N
334	00:22:10	00:22:14	Are you saying that all the DNA evidence from the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested?	N
335	00:22:14	00:22:15	We don't have any choice.	N
336	00:22:15	00:22:18	It's potentially all contaminated.	N
337	00:22:18	00:22:20	Document everything.	N
338	00:22:27	00:22:31	Hey. Your suspect, Jeff Simon, just got released from custody.	Y
339	00:22:34	00:22:36	How the hell did that happen?	N
340	00:22:36	00:22:37	His alibi checked out.	Y
341	00:22:37	00:22:43	I talked to the cop who pulled him over 15 a.m., right around T.O.D.	N
342	00:22:43	00:22:44	It's proof he lost track of her.	Y
343	00:22:44	00:22:46	They jammed him for over an hour.	Y
344	00:22:46	00:22:50	I mean, made him walk the line, gave him a breathalyzer, the whole nine. Guy confessed to stalking.	Y
345	00:22:51	00:22:52	At least you got him on that.	Y
346	00:22:52	00:22:56	Which they'll probably kick down to a misdemeanor because she's dead.	N
347	00:22:56	00:22:59	Hey. Phone number on the matchbook panned out.	N
348	00:22:59	00:23:00	Guy's on his way to P.D.	N
349	00:23:01	00:23:03	You got a name?	N
350	00:23:06	00:23:08	Was it necessary to show up at my office?	N
351	00:23:08	00:23:09	Try the phone.	N
352	00:23:10	00:23:11	I'm an officer of the court.	N
353	00:23:11	00:23:14	Mr. Novak...	N
354	00:23:14	00:23:16	do you recognize this telephone number?	N
355	00:23:16	00:23:18	That's my work number.	N
356	00:23:18	00:23:20	Did you write it on the matchbook?	N
357	00:23:20	00:23:22	I may have. What's this about?	N
358	00:23:22	00:23:23	A homicide.	N
359	00:23:23	00:23:26	That matchbook was found in a dead woman's pocket.	N
360	00:23:28	00:23:30	This the only evidence linking me to the victim?	N
361	00:23:30	00:23:33	This will go much easier if you just answer our questions.	N
362	00:23:33	00:23:35	Oh, yeah? Easier for whom?	N
363	00:23:35	00:23:36	Why didn't you write your name on it?	N
364	00:23:36	00:23:38	I'm a memorable guy.	N
365	00:23:38	00:23:40	Why not your home number?	N
366	00:23:40	00:23:41	This is getting tedious.	N
367	00:23:41	00:23:44	At bars, I give out my work number to weed out the crazies.	N
368	00:23:47	00:23:50	This is Alice Granger.	N
369	00:23:50	00:23:51	Do you know her?	N
370	00:23:54	00:23:57	I bought her a drink last night.	N
371	00:23:58	00:24:03	Okay, why don't you, uh, walk us through your evening?	N
372	00:24:03	00:24:05	Start with I left the office...	N
373	00:24:05	00:24:07	I was deposing a witness.	N
374	00:24:07	00:24:08	Left the office late.	N
375	00:24:08	00:24:11	Stopped at the Peppermill for a burger.	N
376	00:24:11	00:24:12	Medium rare.	N
377	00:24:12	00:24:13	No onions.	N
378	00:24:13	00:24:15	00.	N
379	00:24:17	00:24:18	Met this redhead.	N
380	00:24:18	00:24:20	Bought her a drink and...	N
381	00:24:25	00:24:27	Mr. Novak...	N
382	00:24:27	00:24:30	I'm Catherine Willows.	N
383	00:24:30	00:24:32	CSI.	N
384	00:24:35	00:24:38	You want to know what happened next?	N
385	00:24:38	00:24:40	Ask the redhead.	N
386	00:24:47	00:24:51	At a bar that time of night, we're all after the same thing, aren't we?	N
387	00:24:51	00:24:53	I came onto her.	N
388	00:24:53	00:24:55	She was into me.	N
389	00:24:55	00:25:00	I know when a woman is going to give way and believe me, she was there.	N
390	00:25:00	00:25:02	And then what?	N
391	00:25:03	00:25:05	I walked her out.	N
392	00:25:06	00:25:07	I put my arm around her waist.	N
393	00:25:07	00:25:10	She moved in.	N
394	00:25:10	00:25:12	One minute she's got her tongue down my throat.	N
395	00:25:12	00:25:15	The next, she puts on the brakes.	N
396	00:25:15	00:25:17	She's a bitch and a tease.	N
397	00:25:20	00:25:23	We should ask for his clothes.	N
398	00:25:23	00:25:27	Black leather jacket, black T-shirt, jeans.	N
399	00:25:28	00:25:32	What else should we ask him, Catherine?	N
400	00:25:32	00:25:34	This is what I was trying to tell you.	N
401	00:25:34	00:25:37	Yeah, but you didn't, so now I'm way behind.	N
402	00:25:38	00:25:40	Is he telling the truth?	N
403	00:25:43	00:25:46	He's not lying about anything that pertains to me.	N
404	00:25:49	00:25:50	He hit you.	N
405	00:25:50	00:25:53	No, it was an accident.	N
406	00:25:54	00:26:03	But... by the time it happened, he wasn't who I thought he was, and...	N
407	00:26:03	00:26:04	that scared me.	N
408	00:26:08	00:26:12	Eyewitness claimed that a man matching your description left the bar with the victim.	N
409	00:26:12	00:26:17	Drove off in a dark-colored, four-door sedan.	N
410	00:26:17	00:26:19	What do you drive, Mr. Novak?	N
411	00:26:19	00:26:25	Look, I'm innocent, but it's in my best interest to retain counsel.	N
412	00:26:25	00:26:27	We're done here.	N
413	00:26:34	00:26:39	You have to recuse yourself from processing evidence This guy's a lawyer.	N
414	00:26:39	00:26:40	He could claim prejudicial treatment.	N
415	00:26:40	00:26:43	Your whole life will become public record.	N
416	00:26:43	00:26:44	I have nothing to be ashamed of.	N
417	00:26:44	00:26:46	We all live in glass houses, Catherine.	N
418	00:26:46	00:26:48	You gotta be careful where you take your shower.	N
419	00:26:51	00:26:52	Catherine.	N
420	00:26:56	00:27:00	Just walk me through your interaction with the suspect.	N
421	00:27:00	00:27:04	I met Adam Novak in a bar called The Highball.	N
422	00:27:04	00:27:06	Were you drinking?	N
423	00:27:06	00:27:09	I had one cocktail, on his tab.	N
424	00:27:09	00:27:11	He walked me out to my car.	N
425	00:27:11	00:27:13	Things got physical.	N
426	00:27:13	00:27:15	Could you define physical?	N
427	00:27:15	00:27:19	I believe that I outlined the specifics in my memo.	N
428	00:27:19	00:27:22	Catherine, you know what I'm asking, and it's not in the memo.	N
429	00:27:23	00:27:26	I didn't have sex with him, though he clearly wanted it.	N
430	00:27:26	00:27:27	And you didn't?	N
431	00:27:29	00:27:31	I went out after shift to unwind.	N
432	00:27:31	00:27:34	I even invited Warrick and Nick to come along.	N
433	00:27:34	00:27:35	They had other plans.	N
434	00:27:35	00:27:42	All right. So... when you put on the brakes, Mr. Novak... got angry.	N
435	00:27:43	00:27:45	Yeah.	N
436	00:27:45	00:27:47	I got into my car.	N
437	00:27:47	00:27:48	He went back inside.	N
438	00:27:59	00:28:02	Hey, El, will you do me a favor and call me a cab?	N
439	00:28:02	00:28:03	Thanks.	N
440	00:28:06	00:28:09	This is just a theory, but...	N
441	00:28:09	00:28:14	she was drunk, probably more compliant than I was.	N
442	00:28:14	00:28:16	He walked her outside.	N
443	00:28:16	00:28:21	He waited with her for the taxi, offered her a ride.	N
444	00:28:21	00:28:22	I hate to break up the party.	N
445	00:28:22	00:28:25	Catherine, you got a 419 in Seven Hills.	N
446	00:28:25	00:28:27	I'll grab the kits and meet you outside.	N
447	00:28:30	00:28:31	We'll finish this later?	N
448	00:28:31	00:28:33	Guess we'll have to.	N
449	00:28:45	00:28:47	Look familiar?	N
450	00:28:47	00:28:49	Yeah.	N
451	00:28:49	00:28:50	Like the other night.	N

453	00:28:53	00:28:55	Yeah. Holly Pearson, 31, single.	N
454	00:28:55	00:28:56	She lived across the street.	N
455	00:28:56	00:28:58	Car was locked.	N
456	00:28:59	00:29:00	Keys and purse were accounted for.	N
457	00:29:00	00:29:03	Found them in the mailbox along with her mail.	N
458	00:29:03	00:29:05	Any indication of sexual assault?	N
459	00:29:05	00:29:08	Well, her clothes and underwear are undisturbed.	N
460	00:29:08	00:29:09	Can you remove the jacket?	N
461	00:29:09	00:29:10	Sure.	N
462	00:29:19	00:29:22	Looks like a small-caliber gunshot wound...	N
463	00:29:22	00:29:23	like the first victim.	N
464	00:29:23	00:29:26	Location of the entry wound is different.	N
465	00:29:29	00:29:31	Slug's still inside her.	N
466	00:29:35	00:29:37	Grave is working a case with similarities.	N
467	00:29:37	00:29:44	That victim left a bar called The Highball shortly before she was killed.	N
468	00:29:44	00:29:47	I'm wondering if Holly went out last night.	N
469	00:29:47	00:29:48	I'm on it.	N
470	00:29:50	00:29:51	Thanks.	N
471	00:30:00	00:30:02	There's two sets of shoe prints...	N
472	00:30:04	00:30:06	With a bit of distance between the strides.	N
473	00:30:07	00:30:09	Which means they were both running.	Y
474	00:30:14	00:30:16	Got some shell casings.	N
475	00:30:17	00:30:20	Well, there's only one shot fired in Grissom's case.	N
476	00:30:21	00:30:22	It was close contact.	N
477	00:30:22	00:30:23	He couldn't miss.	Y
478	00:30:23	00:30:26	I'm thinking that she was attacked near her house...	N
479	00:30:27	00:30:29	and then made a run for it.	N
480	00:30:51	00:30:54	Got a courthouse keycard.	N
481	00:30:54	00:30:58	For the parking lot.	N
482	00:30:58	00:31:00	I wonder where Holly Pearson works.	N
483	00:31:00	00:31:02	Adam Novak's a public defender.	N
484	00:31:02	00:31:05	Let's run his prints against this.	N
485	00:31:05	00:31:09	Guys? I found a couple of the victim's coworkers.	N
486	00:31:09	00:31:10	They said she was at The Highball last night.	N
487	00:31:10	00:31:12	Got them coming into PD.	N
488	00:31:13	00:31:15	Holly was just promoted.	N
489	00:31:17	00:31:22	Youngest systems analyst at the bank and we were celebrating.	N
490	00:31:22	00:31:26	She wasn't exactly a party animal.	N
491	00:31:26	00:31:29	We practically forced her to go out.	N
492	00:31:29	00:31:32	Any guys come on strong?	N
493	00:31:32	00:31:35	Yeah. We collected numbers all night.	N
494	00:31:35	00:31:39	Anyone write their number on a matchbook?	N
495	00:31:39	00:31:43	I got, uh... business cards.	N
496	00:31:43	00:31:47	So... you're having a good time and...	N
497	00:31:47	00:31:49	Holly had had enough.	N
498	00:31:49	00:31:54	Yeah. We carpooled, so she took a cab home.	N
499	00:31:55	00:31:57	I'd like to show you some pictures.	N
500	00:31:57	00:32:01	See if you recognize anyone.	N
501	00:32:14	00:32:15	He bought us a round.	N
502	00:32:17	00:32:19	He tried to get friendly.	N
503	00:32:19	00:32:21	When Holly left, did you see that man again?	N
504	00:32:23	00:32:25	Actually, no.	N
505	00:32:31	00:32:33	Hell of a backlog, here, Doc.	N
506	00:32:33	00:32:36	Yeah. Traffic pile-up on I-15.	N
507	00:32:36	00:32:38	Holly Pearson?	N
508	00:32:38	00:32:39	Mm.	N
509	00:32:43	00:32:46	C.O.D.'s a one shot to the back of the head.	N
510	00:32:46	00:32:50	Absence of gun powder and stippling suggests a non-contact wound.	N
511	00:32:50	00:32:52	Dug this out.	N
512	00:32:56	00:32:57	.25 caliber.	N
513	00:32:57	00:32:59	It's the same as the first victim.	N
514	00:32:59	00:33:02	You know, I got something you might find interesting.	N
515	00:33:02	00:33:05	I emptied the stomach and she hadn't eaten for hours.	N
516	00:33:05	00:33:12	A small amount of white zinfandel-- Less than a glass, vintage undetermined, and a tiny scrap of meat.	N
517	00:33:12	00:33:13	Take a look.	N
518	00:33:17	00:33:20	Surface tissue of a human tongue.	N
519	00:33:20	00:33:21	Those are the taste buds.	N
520	00:33:21	00:33:23	She bit her attacker...	N
521	00:33:23	00:33:25	when he tried to kiss her.	N
522	00:33:26	00:33:29	This woman did not go gently into that good night.	N
523	00:33:43	00:33:45	Heard you may be looking at a second victim?	N
524	00:33:45	00:33:46	Yeah.	N
525	00:33:46	00:33:50	Bullets from both homicides are from the same gun.	N
526	00:33:50	00:33:52	I just got off the phone with Courthouse Security.	N
527	00:33:52	00:33:57	That keycard that you and Catherine found belongs a guy named Adam Novak.	N
528	00:33:57	00:33:59	Only prints I found on the card were his.	N
529	00:33:59	00:34:01	Well, let's call PD and bring him in.	N
530	00:34:36	00:34:38	Mom, Lindsey, go inside the house.	N
531	00:34:39	00:34:44	Believe it or not, Catherine does know how to say, Hello, how are you? Would you like a cup of coffee?	N
532	00:34:44	00:34:47	I was talking to your mother about the case we're working.	N
533	00:34:47	00:34:48	Mom, we're fine.	N
534	00:34:48	00:34:49	Take Lindsey inside.	N
535	00:34:53	00:34:55	Let's go.	N
536	00:34:55	00:34:57	I don't, I don't want to.	N
537	00:34:57	00:34:58	Lindsey.	N
538	00:34:58	00:35:00	Are you going to go out again?	N
539	00:35:00	00:35:01	No. I'm coming in.	N
540	00:35:01	00:35:02	I want to hear about your day.	N
541	00:35:04	00:35:06	It was a pleasure meeting you.	N
542	00:35:10	00:35:11	What the hell are you doing here?	N
543	00:35:11	00:35:15	I want to know why you're setting me up, manipulating evidence to make me look guilty.	N
544	00:35:15	00:35:16	All because I came on too strong?	N
545	00:35:16	00:35:17	I want you out of here.	N
546	00:35:17	00:35:18	I didn't get my signals crossed.	N
547	00:35:19	00:35:21	You changed the play, and you're screaming foul.	N
548	00:35:21	00:35:22	That's some power trip, babe.	N
549	00:35:22	00:35:24	Who's the guilty one here?	N
550	00:35:24	00:35:25	You want to talk to me, call your lawyer.	N
551	00:35:25	00:35:27	Set up an appointment down at PD.	N
552	00:35:27	00:35:28	You think I killed her?	N
553	00:35:28	00:35:29	Back off.	N
554	00:35:30	00:35:31	You going to shoot me?	N
555	00:35:31	00:35:32	If you take one more step.	N
556	00:35:35	00:35:36	You bitch.	N
557	00:35:37	00:35:39	You came to my house.	N
558	00:35:43	00:35:45	Mr. Novak, would you stick out your tongue, please?	N
559	00:35:45	00:35:46	What is this about?	N
560	00:35:47	00:35:49	Well, right now, it's about his tongue.	N
561	00:35:49	00:35:50	And two dead women.	N
562	00:35:50	00:35:54	We believe the second victim, Holly Pearson, bit her attacker's tongue.	N
563	00:35:54	00:35:56	Open up, please.	N
564	00:36:02	00:36:04	Uh-uh. Once more.	N
565	00:36:09	00:36:11	Thank you. That's all I need.	N
566	00:36:13	00:36:14	Have a seat.	N
567	00:36:22	00:36:24	You comfortable? We're going to be a while.	N
568	00:36:24	00:36:26	I know how this looks.	N
569	00:36:26	00:36:27	Adam, I...	N
570	00:36:27	00:36:30	I advise some of the stupidest guys that come through this room.	N
571	00:36:30	00:36:32	And it's my job is to keep their mouths shut.	N
572	00:36:32	00:36:36	And I know what you're thinking-- that I killed Alice Granger.	N
573	00:36:44	00:36:47	You're a mind reader.	Y
574	00:36:47	00:36:49	I already admitted that I picked her up at a bar the other night.	N
575	00:36:49	00:36:54	What I didn't mention, and you didn't ask was that I gave her a ride home.	N
576	00:36:54	00:36:58	It got hot and heavy.	N
577	00:36:58	00:37:00	We both got what we needed.	N
578	00:37:00	00:37:04	Then she said good night and got out of the car.	N
579	00:37:04	00:37:05	I drove off.	N
580	00:37:05	00:37:10	Uh, Do you have any evidence at all that refutes my client's account, or suggests otherwise?	N
581	00:37:10	00:37:18	Our evidence pertains to the second victim, killed last night with the same gun, and we believe that a portion of your client's tongue was in her stomach.	N
582	00:37:18	00:37:19	I can explain that.	N
583	00:37:19	00:37:20	Oh? Really.	N
584	00:37:20	00:37:22	Her taxi never showed up.	N
585	00:37:22	00:37:26	I was drunk. Out of line.	N
586	00:37:27	00:37:29	Bad couple of days, thanks to you guys.	N
587	00:37:29	00:37:33	I was looking for a little release and I chose the wrong girl.	N
588	00:37:33	00:37:35	And what happened next?	N
589	00:37:35	00:37:36	Her taxi finally showed up.	N
590	00:37:36	00:37:42	I spoke to both the bartender at The Highball and the cab company, and a cab was ordered and drove the victim home.	N
591	00:37:42	00:37:48	Mr. Novak, have you ever been to Holly Pearson's house?	N
592	00:37:48	00:37:51	No. I have no idea where she lived.	N
593	00:37:51	00:37:54	Then how do you explain your courthouse keycard which we found near her body?	N
594	00:37:54	00:37:59	CSI matched the prints on the card. Only yours.	N
595	00:37:59	00:38:02	Every attorney in the Public Defenders Office is issued one card.	N
596	00:38:02	00:38:05	Mine has never left my car.	N
597	00:38:05	00:38:06	I keep it in the center console.	N
598	00:38:06	00:38:07	You don't need a warrant.	N
599	00:38:07	00:38:09	You have my permission to check.	N
600	00:38:09	00:38:10	It should be there.	N
601	00:38:10	00:38:13	Well, that won't be hard to verify, because your car's already at CSI.	N
602	00:38:19	00:38:20	Nick.	N
603	00:38:20	00:38:21	Hey.	N
604	00:38:21	00:38:23	The center console.	N
605	00:38:23	00:38:25	Was there a parking lot car key inside?	N
606	00:38:25	00:38:27	No. Two sticks of gum and a pack of condoms.	N
607	00:38:27	00:38:29	Why?	N
608	00:38:29	00:38:35	Suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene wasn't his.	N
609	00:38:35	00:38:37	It looks like he was lying.	N
610	00:38:37	00:38:38	We got him.	N
611	00:38:38	00:38:44	I don't know how you're going to take this, but I think this car was recently broken into.	N
612	00:38:44	00:38:46	These scratches...	N
613	00:38:46	00:38:47	they look fresh.	N
614	00:38:47	00:38:49	B&amp;E 101.	N
615	00:38:50	00:38:52	The Slim Jim.	N
616	00:38:59	00:39:02	Somebody could've swiped his keycard.	N
617	00:39:02	00:39:04	And then locked the car back up.	N
618	00:39:05	00:39:08	Novak wouldn't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again.	N
619	00:39:08	00:39:10	Did you find any prints?	N
620	00:39:10	00:39:13	Smudges and partials, inside and out.	N
621	00:39:14	00:39:16	Run 'em.	N
622	00:39:40	00:39:43	Let's run through the night Alice died again.	N
623	00:39:43	00:39:44	We've been through this.	Y
624	00:39:44	00:39:45	I have an alibi.	Y
625	00:39:45	00:39:47	Your alibi only proves you lost track of her.	Y
626	00:39:47	00:39:49	You knew where Alice lived.	Y
627	00:39:49	00:39:51	Have you been in Adam Novak's car recently?	N
628	00:39:51	00:39:55	No. I don't even know an Adam Novak.	Y
629	00:39:55	00:39:58	But you identified his vehicle as the car that Alice left the bar in.	Y
630	00:39:58	00:39:59	I didn't know whose car it was.	Y
631	00:39:59	00:40:00	Then why did we find your prints in it?	Y
632	00:40:03	00:40:06	Maybe somebody's trying to frame me.	Y
633	00:40:06	00:40:08	No, but I think that you're familiar with the concept.	Y
634	00:40:10	00:40:18	You were obsessed with Alice, and when you saw Adam having at her, you flipped out.	Y
635	00:40:23	00:40:30	I mean, here's a woman that you can't get any traction with, yet she's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar.	Y
636	00:40:53	00:40:58	I mean, lucky for you, The Highball was Adam's second home.	Y
637	00:40:58	00:41:04	The next night, you came back and saw his car in the parking lot.	Y
638	00:41:04	00:41:06	Creative justice. You could get them both.	Y
639	00:41:06	00:41:13	It was just bad luck that Holly Pearson met Adam that night.	Y
640	00:41:13	00:41:21	You had no reason to kill her, but you followed her home and worked up the nerve.	Y
641	00:41:42	00:41:45	You made one mistake, though.	Y
642	00:41:45	00:41:50	The evidence that you used to frame him brought us back to you.	Y
643	00:41:58	00:42:00	You figured out the source of the contamination?	N
644	00:42:00	00:42:04	I got a positive result off my negative control.	N
645	00:42:04	00:42:05	Matched the contamination.	N
646	00:42:05	00:42:14	Turns out somebody at the manufacturer forgot to put on their mask and then sneezed or coughed on what was supposed to be a sterile product.	N
647	00:42:14	00:42:16	You have to collect everyone's swabs.	N
648	00:42:16	00:42:18	Kits. Trucks. Vests.	N
649	00:42:18	00:42:19	Work stations.	N
650	00:42:19	00:42:21	How long till the new shipment gets here?	N
651	00:42:21	00:42:24	It's on its way. Until then, do it old school.	N
652	00:42:28	00:42:30	Gil.	N
653	00:42:33	00:42:39	I'd ask you out for a drink, but under the circumstances, it's, uh...	N
654	00:42:41	00:42:43	Okay, how long is this going to go on?	N
655	00:42:43	00:42:46	I don't know, Catherine.	N
656	00:42:47	00:42:49	Gil, it was an act of omission.	N
657	00:42:49	00:42:53	How many times have we heard a public defender say that?	N
658	00:42:54	00:42:56	I went out after work.	N
659	00:42:56	00:42:59	Is it a crime to want a little human contact?	N
660	00:42:59	00:43:01	I guess that's why I don't go out.	N
