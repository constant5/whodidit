27	27	27	00:01:23	00:01:26	So, the usher finally came over to shut him up.	N
28	28	28	00:01:26	00:01:28	Yeah, somebody beat him to it.	N

42	42	42	00:02:40	00:02:45	Well, the killer could have stood over him, placed his hand over his mouth, stabbed him in the back of the head.	N

74	74	74	00:04:28	00:04:33	If you ask me, anybody who leaves their phone on in a movie deserves to get stabbed in the head.	N
75	75	75	00:04:33	00:04:35	That's why nobody ask you.	N
76	76	76	00:04:37	00:04:39	Detective.	N

87	87	87	00:05:09	00:05:13	No cash, no ID, just a driver's permit.	N

100	100	100	00:05:34	00:05:39	Question is not what we're going to find on the murder weapon; question is what isn't on it.	N

107	107	107	00:05:47	00:05:49	I just want to match the blood to our victim.	N
108	108	108	00:05:49	00:05:51	And you want to know if there's a recoverable print.	N
109	109	109	00:05:51	00:05:52	Uh-huh.	N
110	110	110	00:05:53	00:05:55	You want to race?	N
111	111	111	00:05:55	00:05:56	What's the bet?	N
112	112	112	00:05:57	00:05:59	Hmm...	N

122	122	122	00:07:00	00:07:02	26 seconds.	N
123	123	123	00:07:02	00:07:04	That sounds like a no answer.	N
124	124	124	00:07:04	00:07:15	Yeah, but 555-0110 was the number 26, 11 Someone needed to talk to him pretty bad.	N

135	135	135	00:09:00	00:09:02	That's funny. Very funny.	N
136	136	136	00:09:09	00:09:11	Did you get the hole in the roof?	N
137	137	137	00:09:11	00:09:12	You find anything else up there?	N
138	138	138	00:09:12	00:09:14	No.	N

141	141	141	00:09:18	00:09:24	Mixed with small pieces of black plastic.	N
142	142	142	00:09:25	00:09:27	You almost finished with that?	N
143	143	143	00:09:27	00:09:28	What's your count?	N
144	144	144	00:09:28	00:09:30	Yeah. 109 rods.	N

146	146	146	00:09:33	00:09:37	How in the world do trajectories occur 15 to 20 feet off the ground?	N
147	147	147	00:09:37	00:09:38	Horizontally?	N
148	148	148	00:09:41	00:09:43	What the hell went on here?	N
149	149	149	00:09:49	00:09:49	Audrey Hilden?	N

153	153	153	00:09:55	00:09:58	Why don't you come inside. Please.	N
154	154	154	00:10:00	00:10:02	He was my dentist. That's terrible.	N
155	155	155	00:10:02	00:10:09	He'd asked me to go to the movies, and I said yes, but... it was a late show, and I had to get up early for work.	N
156	156	156	00:10:09	00:10:15	Well, we know that Dr. Sugarman called you at home two minutes before the movie started, and that you didn't pick up.	N
157	157	157	00:10:15	00:10:18	I was screening. I figured he'd get my message.	N
158	158	158	00:10:18	00:10:21	And why did you call him three times in a row, 40 minutes later?	N
159	159	159	00:10:21	00:10:23	I felt bad standing him up.	N
160	160	160	00:10:23	00:10:25	I called to apologize.	N
161	161	161	00:10:25	00:10:29	I figured I'd get his Voice Mail, but when I didn't, I tried again.	N
162	162	162	00:10:29	00:10:30	And you were here alone?	N
163	163	163	00:10:30	00:10:32	Yes.	N
164	164	164	00:10:32	00:10:33	Can anyone verify that?	N
165	165	165	00:10:33	00:10:35	Why?	N
166	166	166	00:10:40	00:10:42	Still screening?	N
167	167	167	00:10:57	00:10:59	Do you see a lot of movies at the Art House Theater?	N
168	168	168	00:10:59	00:11:01	Sure. I love old movies.	N
169	169	169	00:11:01	00:11:04	I see they recently had a Hitchcock Retrospective.	N
170	170	170	00:11:04	00:11:05	I prefer French New Wave.	N
171	171	171	00:11:05	00:11:08	If you'll excuse me now, I have to go to work.	N
172	172	172	00:11:08	00:11:10	We'll be in touch.	N
173	173	173	00:11:17	00:11:19	Geez, what was this kid, tortured?	N
174	174	174	00:11:19	00:11:21	Couple of fractured ribs.	N
175	175	175	00:11:21	00:11:23	Deep purple contusions of the presternal chest wall.	N
176	176	176	00:11:23	00:11:25	Each one around two inches in diameter.	N
177	177	177	00:11:25	00:11:27	I stopped counting around nine.	N
178	178	178	00:11:27	00:11:30	What do you think could've done this? Baseball bat?	N
179	179	179	00:11:30	00:11:33	It's hard to tell. Whatever it was, it had a great deal of velocity.	N
180	180	180	00:11:33	00:11:34	Yeah.	N
181	181	181	00:11:34	00:11:37	single gunshot to the chest.	N
182	182	182	00:11:37	00:11:38	No evidence of gunshot residue.	N
183	183	183	00:11:38	00:11:42	Shot from a distance. Yeah.	N
184	184	184	00:11:50	00:11:52	And at a downward angle...	N
185	185	185	00:11:52	00:11:54	It's, uh...	N
186	186	186	00:11:54	00:11:59	It's about 25 degrees.	N
187	187	187	00:11:59	00:12:00	He was shot from above.	N
188	188	188	00:12:04	00:12:06	Rooftop angle is 45 degrees.	N
189	189	189	00:12:06	00:12:08	This is 25 degrees?	N
190	190	190	00:12:10	00:12:11	It's impossible.	N
191	191	191	00:12:11	00:12:15	If that's the case, he was shot by somebody 10 to 15 feet tall.	N
192	192	192	00:12:15	00:12:17	What else you got?	N
193	193	193	00:12:17	00:12:23	Scabbing abrasions on the elbows, the back and kneecaps.	N
194	194	194	00:12:23	00:12:26	Looks to be harmless boys will be boys stuff.	N
195	195	195	00:12:26	00:12:30	There's nothing harmless about death.	N
196	196	196	00:12:34	00:12:36	Don't tell me-- Greg won the bet.	N
197	197	197	00:12:36	00:12:39	The blood on the screwdriver definitely belongs to your victim.	N
198	198	198	00:12:39	00:12:42	It was incredible how fast he got me back the results.	N
199	199	199	00:12:42	00:12:44	I don't know how he does it.	N
200	200	200	00:12:44	00:12:46	Now I got to wear this stupid thing all day.	N
201	201	201	00:12:46	00:12:49	Oh, look at him, hovering.	N
202	202	202	00:12:49	00:12:51	Making sure I still have it on.	N
203	203	203	00:12:51	00:12:54	Do us all a favor and get him out in the field, will you, Grissom?	N
204	204	204	00:12:54	00:12:55	He's going stir crazy in here.	N
205	205	205	00:12:55	00:12:57	Jaqui, do you have anything for us?	N
206	206	206	00:12:57	00:12:59	A palm print.	N
207	207	207	00:12:59	00:13:02	Oh, great. Let's, uh, go back to Audrey's and see if we have a match.	N
208	208	208	00:13:02	00:13:04	Not quite.	N
209	209	209	00:13:04	00:13:06	Look at the ridges.	N
210	210	210	00:13:06	00:13:09	Too consistent.	N
211	211	211	00:13:09	00:13:11	Looks like fine grain.	N
212	212	212	00:13:11	00:13:12	Leather.	N
213	213	213	00:13:13	00:13:14	Killer wore gloves.	N
214	214	214	00:13:14	00:13:15	Okay...	N
215	215	215	00:13:15	00:13:21	here's what's happening-- three months ago, Audrey Hilden filed a sexual malpractice suit against our Dr. Sugarman.	N
216	216	216	00:13:22	00:13:25	The suit claims that she was molested while she was under anesthesia.	N
217	217	217	00:13:25	00:13:27	And she was going on a date with this guy?	N
218	218	218	00:13:27	00:13:29	Yeah. Sugarman countersued.	N
219	219	219	00:13:29	00:13:32	He's represented by big-time attorneys, so she backed down.	N
220	220	220	00:13:32	00:13:34	Well, a screwdriver's cheaper than an attorney.	N
221	221	221	00:13:34	00:13:36	Yeah.	N
222	222	222	00:13:36	00:13:37	Well, uh, there's more.	N
223	223	223	00:13:37	00:13:40	Remember the usher who likes to smoke the chronic?	N
224	224	224	00:13:40	00:13:45	He claims he saw a redheaded woman make a phone call halfway through the movie, so I'm going to check it out.	N
225	225	225	00:13:45	00:13:48	Want to tag along?	N
226	226	226	00:13:51	00:13:52	This where the limbo party is?	N
227	227	227	00:13:53	00:13:54	Can I come in? Yeah.	N
228	228	228	00:13:54	00:13:57	Sorry, I don't let everyone in here.	N
229	229	229	00:13:57	00:13:59	Well, I've got your one-to-ones.	N
230	230	230	00:13:59	00:14:02	The tire treads, there's nothing specific here.	N
231	231	231	00:14:03	00:14:07	Bummer. But the shoe prints that you took, they look interesting.	N
232	232	232	00:14:07	00:14:10	It looks like five suspects walked in, and four ran out.	N
233	233	233	00:14:10	00:14:12	Four guilty people out there somewhere.	N
234	234	234	00:14:13	00:14:14	No doubt.	N
235	235	235	00:14:14	00:14:16	How's it coming with your big bamboo here?	N
236	236	236	00:14:16	00:14:20	Well, I have black lung from all the powder, and not a single print, nothing, nada.	N
237	237	237	00:14:20	00:14:21	You test for GSR?	N
238	238	238	00:14:21	00:14:24	The place was riddled with bullets-- it wouldn't hurt.	N
239	239	239	00:14:24	00:14:25	Wouldn't hurt.	N
240	240	240	00:14:40	00:14:42	Nothing.	N
241	241	241	00:14:42	00:14:44	Maybe this has nothing to do with the case.	N
242	242	242	00:14:44	00:14:46	Maybe it was just a piece of debris left at the scene.	N
243	243	243	00:14:46	00:14:49	No, no. I-I'm not quitting. No.	N
244	244	244	00:14:49	00:14:52	I am in too deep.	N
245	245	245	00:14:55	00:14:57	Where you going? Trace.	N
246	246	246	00:14:58	00:14:59	Maybe Hodges can find something.	N
247	247	247	00:14:59	00:15:01	Oh, coming through. Careful, people.	N
248	248	248	00:15:01	00:15:03	Easy.	N
249	249	249	00:15:03	00:15:04	Hey, Brown. PD called.	N
250	250	250	00:15:04	00:15:05	Mrs. McCallum's there.	N
251	251	251	00:15:06	00:15:08	The mother.	N
252	252	252	00:15:08	00:15:10	Tell them I'm on my way.	N
253	253	253	00:15:14	00:15:16	I was getting myself a soda.	N
254	254	254	00:15:16	00:15:18	You know, we're allowed to do that.	N
255	255	255	00:15:18	00:15:24	A tall redhead came out of the theater, and then she made a phone call from over there.	N
256	256	256	00:15:30	00:15:32	From the pay phone.	N
257	257	257	00:15:32	00:15:34	What? I... What? I'm on it. I'm on it.	N
258	258	258	00:15:34	00:15:36	Did you happen to notice if she was wearing gloves?	N
259	259	259	00:15:36	00:15:38	Yeah, she was, actually.	N
260	260	260	00:15:38	00:15:42	I thought it was really weird, 'cause it's, like, 70 degrees in here.	N
261	261	261	00:15:43	00:15:44	Did you notice anything else?	N
262	262	262	00:15:44	00:15:49	No. She just threw something in the trash and headed out.	N
263	263	263	00:15:57	00:15:59	The cleaning crew's in the theater now.	N
264	264	264	00:15:59	00:16:02	They got a late start 'cause of you guys.	N
265	265	265	00:16:11	00:16:13	Excuse me.	N
266	266	266	00:16:14	00:16:16	What happened to the garbage that was in the can in the lobby?	N
267	267	267	00:16:16	00:16:20	Well, it's already been bagged up, but it should be around here somewhere.	N
268	268	268	00:16:20	00:16:23	Excuse me. Where'd you get those gloves?	N
269	269	269	00:16:23	00:16:25	If it's garbage, it's hers.	N
270	270	270	00:16:25	00:16:29	They let us keep whatever we find as long as it's been thrown out.	N
271	271	271	00:16:29	00:16:34	I'll tell you what-- I'll buy you a new pair of gloves.	N
272	272	272	00:16:46	00:16:48	Whatever happened to Take one down, pass it around?	N
273	273	273	00:16:48	00:16:49	That's the best part.	N
274	274	274	00:16:49	00:16:52	You know us lab rats have to do something to get through the day.	N
275	275	275	00:16:52	00:16:55	I know, I just dumped a sack of bullets on Bobby Dawson.	N
276	276	276	00:16:55	00:16:57	So, why don't you sing me a tune I want to hear?	N
277	277	277	00:16:57	00:17:00	Well... how about...	N
278	278	278	00:17:00	00:17:02	Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.	N
279	279	279	00:17:02	00:17:04	He ain't heavy.	N
280	280	280	00:17:04	00:17:07	He's my brother.	N
281	281	281	00:17:07	00:17:10	DNA? From the beer bottles?	N
282	282	282	00:17:10	00:17:12	Five different donors-- two of them are related.	N
283	283	283	00:17:12	00:17:18	Donor number one, Tim McCallum, the victim; donor number two, his relative, most likely a brother.	N
284	284	284	00:17:18	00:17:20	No telling if he's heavy or not.	N
285	285	285	00:17:20	00:17:23	I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. McCallum.	N
286	286	286	00:17:26	00:17:28	Are you Timmy's brother?	N
287	287	287	00:17:28	00:17:30	Yeah.	N
288	288	288	00:17:30	00:17:33	Kevin's the only son I have left.	N
289	289	289	00:17:33	00:17:39	We were able to identify Timmy by the driver's permit that we found at the scene.	N
290	290	290	00:17:39	00:17:41	Had he been driving long?	N
291	291	291	00:17:41	00:17:42	A few months.	N
292	292	292	00:17:42	00:17:48	I know that law says you're supposed to have an adult present, but I work graveyard.	N
293	293	293	00:17:49	00:17:51	Kevin usually drives with him.	N
294	294	294	00:17:51	00:17:54	What kind of car does Timmy drive?	N
295	295	295	00:17:54	00:17:55	We have a mini-van.	N
296	296	296	00:17:55	00:17:59	It's more safe.	N
297	297	297	00:17:59	00:18:03	This is an ongoing investigation, so we are going to need to see that vehicle.	N
298	298	298	00:18:05	00:18:07	Do you ever drive the mini-van, Kevin?	N
299	299	299	00:18:07	00:18:10	Sometimes, yeah.	N
300	300	300	00:18:10	00:18:12	Did you drive Timmy to the warehouse the other night?	N
301	301	301	00:18:12	00:18:13	No.	N
302	302	302	00:18:13	00:18:14	What warehouse?	N
303	303	303	00:18:14	00:18:19	We have reason to believe that Kevin was at the warehouse that night.	N
304	304	304	00:18:20	00:18:22	We found his DNA on some beer bottles.	N
305	305	305	00:18:24	00:18:25	Beer?	N
306	306	306	00:18:25	00:18:26	Kevin...	N
307	307	307	00:18:26	00:18:29	Mom... I bought beer for Timmy.	N
308	308	308	00:18:30	00:18:31	I don't do it all the time.	N
309	309	309	00:18:31	00:18:33	He begged me.	N
310	310	310	00:18:33	00:18:37	He... he said he was going out partying with some friends.	N
311	311	311	00:18:37	00:18:39	If Mom catches you with these, you didn't get them from me.	N
312	312	312	00:18:39	00:18:41	Bro, there's one missing.	N
313	313	313	00:18:41	00:18:44	I got thirsty. Later, freak.	N
314	314	314	00:18:46	00:18:49	I took a sip-- I gave him the rest of the 12-pack.	N
315	315	315	00:18:51	00:18:53	Sorry, Mom.	N
316	316	316	00:18:53	00:18:56	Mr. Brown, I don't know what to say.	N
317	317	317	00:18:56	00:19:03	I'm a single mother... I work nights, and you can't keep your eyes on your kids all the time.	N
318	318	318	00:19:03	00:19:08	At a certain age, you just have to trust them.	N
319	319	319	00:19:08	00:19:10	I understand.	N
320	320	320	00:19:10	00:19:15	We are going to need to keep Kevin here to ask him some more questions about that night.	N
321	321	321	00:19:15	00:19:17	Do you object?	N
322	322	322	00:19:18	00:19:20	N-No.	N
323	323	323	00:19:23	00:19:26	Spiral gouges.	N
324	324	324	00:19:26	00:19:27	Check it out.	N
325	325	325	00:19:32	00:19:34	From tip to tip.	N
326	326	326	00:19:34	00:19:36	What do you think caused these marks?	N
327	327	327	00:19:36	00:19:39	Give me more time-- I'm not a miracle worker.	N
328	328	328	00:19:39	00:19:40	Well, that's obvious, Hodges.	N
329	329	329	00:19:41	00:19:43	If you were a miracle worker, you wouldn't be rude.	N
330	330	330	00:19:43	00:19:45	I wasn't being rude, I was being curt.	N
331	331	331	00:19:45	00:19:47	Rude would be, When I know, you'll know.	N
332	332	332	00:19:47	00:19:48	Friends?	N
333	333	333	00:19:48	00:19:49	No.	N
334	334	334	00:19:49	00:19:52	Hodges, how's it coming with that glass?	N
335	335	335	00:19:54	00:19:57	Looks like there's some kind of coating on it.	N
336	336	336	00:19:57	00:20:00	More specifically, crystallized calcium fluoride.	N
337	337	337	00:20:00	00:20:02	You ran it through the I.R.?	N
338	338	338	00:20:02	00:20:04	Please. I.R. says fluorspar.	N
339	339	339	00:20:04	00:20:07	I say high-end optics.	N
340	340	340	00:20:07	00:20:08	Camera lens.	N
341	341	341	00:20:08	00:20:10	You think someone has this murder on tape?	N
342	342	342	00:20:10	00:20:17	So, the gloves match the palm print on the murder weapon as well as the pay phone in the theater lobby.	N
343	343	343	00:20:17	00:20:21	Unfortunately, there was no epithelials inside the gloves because the cleaning woman had ammonia on her hands.	N
344	344	344	00:20:21	00:20:23	Ah, I see.	N
345	345	345	00:20:23	00:20:27	Well, according to this, a phone call was made 25.	N
346	346	346	00:20:27	00:20:32	Well, Audrey called Dr. Sugarman's cell 26.	N
347	347	347	00:20:32	00:20:36	Well, obviously, she didn't make it home in one minute.	N
348	348	348	00:20:36	00:20:37	We're looking for someone else.	N
349	349	349	00:20:37	00:20:40	The mysterious redhead in the theater?	N
350	350	350	00:20:40	00:20:43	Maybe Audrey hired a pro who called up to say, uh, It's done.	N
351	351	351	00:20:43	00:20:47	Well, if she couldn't afford a powerful attorney, how did she pay for a hit man?	N
352	352	352	00:20:47	00:20:49	Hit woman.	N
353	353	353	00:20:49	00:20:51	Why don't we ask her?	N
354	354	354	00:20:56	00:20:59	You hear that? Phone's off the hook.	N
355	355	355	00:21:06	00:21:08	There must be another way in.	N
356	356	356	00:21:45	00:21:52	She used an extension cord and tied it to the railing and must have jumped off.	N
357	357	357	00:21:58	00:22:00	Yeah, this is Brass.	N
358	358	358	00:22:00	00:22:02	I got a DB.	N
359	359	359	00:22:02	00:22:05	Yeah.	N
360	360	360	00:22:13	00:22:18	Our only suspect apparently commits suicide.	N
361	361	361	00:22:18	00:22:20	Convenient.	N
362	362	362	00:22:22	00:22:24	Too convenient.	N
363	363	363	00:22:28	00:22:30	Catherine...	N
364	364	364	00:22:30	00:22:35	she's got a whole nother set of horizontal marks on her neck, below the cord.	N
365	365	365	00:22:35	00:22:39	And postmortem bruising.	N
366	366	366	00:22:39	00:22:43	I think she was strangled first, and then hanged.	N
367	367	367	00:22:45	00:22:46	No signs of a break-in...	N
368	368	368	00:22:47	00:22:48	or a struggle.	N
369	369	369	00:22:49	00:22:51	She may have been killed by someone she knew.	N
370	370	370	00:22:51	00:22:53	She was dragged.	N
371	371	371	00:22:53	00:22:56	She's got carpet fibers on her heels.	N
372	372	372	00:22:59	00:23:03	Yeah, she was dragged over here, tied off and shoved over.	N
373	373	373	00:23:10	00:23:13	You got something?	N
374	374	374	00:23:13	00:23:19	When we were here earlier, there was a movie schedule pinned up there that had a handwritten note on it.	N
375	375	375	00:23:20	00:23:22	I'm not sure she wanted me to see it.	N
376	376	376	00:23:22	00:23:24	Now it's gone.	N
377	377	377	00:23:24	00:23:26	Maybe she threw it away.	N
378	378	378	00:24:36	00:24:37	Venus and Serena.	N
379	379	379	00:24:37	00:24:39	Perfect match.	N
380	380	380	00:25:22	00:25:25	Timmy's 15, I'm 18.	N
381	381	381	00:25:25	00:25:26	He's got his friends, I got my friends.	N
382	382	382	00:25:26	00:25:28	We don't do the same things.	N
383	383	383	00:25:28	00:25:29	We don't hang together.	N
384	384	384	00:25:29	00:25:30	Evidence says you were there.	N
385	385	385	00:25:30	00:25:32	You want to go down for suspicion of murder?	N
386	386	386	00:25:34	00:25:36	Or you want to stop digging your own grave?	N
387	387	387	00:25:37	00:25:38	Just talked to Bobby Dawson.	N
388	388	388	00:25:40	00:25:42	nine-millimeter semi-automatic.	N
389	389	389	00:25:42	00:25:44	How's this going?	N
390	390	390	00:25:44	00:25:48	I found a 12-pack container in the McCallum minivan.	N
391	391	391	00:25:48	00:25:51	Sales slip said Jenko Liquors.	N
392	392	392	00:25:51	00:25:56	I'll check the surveillance, see if we can get some footage of this guy.	N
393	393	393	00:25:56	00:25:58	What is that on his elbow?	N
394	394	394	00:25:58	00:25:59	It's just a scab.	N
395	395	395	00:25:59	00:26:01	Got it skateboarding.	N
396	396	396	00:26:01	00:26:02	Can we see it?	N
397	397	397	00:26:05	00:26:08	Peel it back.	N
398	398	398	00:26:15	00:26:16	Skateboarding?	N
399	399	399	00:26:17	00:26:19	Why don't you stand up and take off your shirt.	N
400	400	400	00:26:19	00:26:21	Don't you guys need a warrant for that?	N
401	401	401	00:26:21	00:26:25	We get a warrant, and we're going to strip you down to nothing, then ask you to bend over-- choose.	N
402	402	402	00:26:33	00:26:35	Geez, man, what happened to you?	N
403	403	403	00:26:35	00:26:37	Turn around.	N
404	404	404	00:26:40	00:26:41	Those are the same markings your brother had.	N
405	405	405	00:26:41	00:26:43	You want to tell us what went down here?	N
406	406	406	00:26:43	00:26:45	I can't talk about it.	N
407	407	407	00:26:47	00:26:48	I'm sorry.	N
408	408	408	00:26:48	00:26:52	Hey, listen, if-if you're the victim here, you can tell us.	N
409	409	409	00:26:53	00:26:55	Okay?	N
410	410	410	00:26:58	00:27:00	Kevin, who did this to you, man?	N
411	411	411	00:27:07	00:27:11	Well, there's an awful lot of water damage, but, um...	N
412	412	412	00:27:11	00:27:13	there's some kind of an impression.	N
413	413	413	00:27:13	00:27:15	Well, maybe this will bring it up.	N
414	414	414	00:27:21	00:27:24	It's written above Strangers On A Train.	N
415	415	415	00:27:24	00:27:27	Strangers On A Train.	N
416	416	416	00:27:27	00:27:28	Is that the one with the perfect murder?	N
417	417	417	00:27:28	00:27:32	Two strangers meet on a train, make a pact to get rid of each other's problems.	N
418	418	418	00:27:32	00:27:35	They figure since neither has a motive for the killings, they won't be caught.	N
419	419	419	00:27:35	00:27:37	Life imitating art?	N
420	420	420	00:27:37	00:27:40	In the movie, Robert Walker kills Farley Granger's wife.	N
421	421	421	00:27:40	00:27:46	Granger didn't think he was serious, so when he refuses to kill Walker's father, Walker goes after him.	N
422	422	422	00:27:46	00:27:50	So if Audrey is Farley Granger...	N
423	423	423	00:27:50	00:27:52	Who's playing Robert Walker's part?	N
424	424	424	00:27:55	00:27:57	Sphere E4-117.	N
425	425	425	00:27:57	00:28:00	Well, that's got to be the Sphere hotel.	N
426	426	426	00:28:00	00:28:02	It's not a hotel room, though.	N
427	427	427	00:28:02	00:28:04	Locker, safety deposit box...	N
428	428	428	00:28:04	00:28:05	Parking space, maybe.	N
429	429	429	00:28:05	00:28:07	Yeah.	N
430	430	430	00:28:10	00:28:11	Audrey who?	N
431	431	431	00:28:11	00:28:13	Hilden.	N
432	432	432	00:28:13	00:28:14	Nah, I never heard of her.	N
433	433	433	00:28:15	00:28:16	What's this about?	N
434	434	434	00:28:16	00:28:17	E4-117.	N
435	435	435	00:28:17	00:28:20	Your assigned parking space.	N
436	436	436	00:28:20	00:28:23	It was written on a movie schedule we found in Ms. Hilden's home.	N
437	437	437	00:28:23	00:28:26	Well, look, I meet a lot of women.	N
438	438	438	00:28:26	00:28:28	She a dancer? She work for me before?	N
439	439	439	00:28:28	00:28:30	Hey, Michelle. Mmm!	N
440	440	440	00:28:30	00:28:36	this show is very hot, all the chicks want to be in it, and actually, they, uh, got to go through me.	N
441	441	441	00:28:38	00:28:39	Ever been to the Art House movie theater?	N
442	442	442	00:28:39	00:28:41	No. Where's that?	N
443	443	443	00:28:41	00:28:44	Have you ever seen any Hitchcock movies?	N
444	444	444	00:28:44	00:28:46	Strangers On A Train?	N
445	445	445	00:28:48	00:28:49	Alfred Hitchcock?	N
446	446	446	00:28:49	00:28:50	Mr. Haines?	N
447	447	447	00:28:50	00:28:53	Whose station is this one?	N
448	448	448	00:28:53	00:28:56	Oh, that's Kelly Goodson's.	N
449	449	449	00:28:56	00:28:57	Royal pain in the ass.	N
450	450	450	00:29:10	00:29:12	Can I help you?	N
451	451	451	00:29:12	00:29:13	That's my locker.	N
452	452	452	00:29:14	00:29:15	It was open.	N
453	453	453	00:29:15	00:29:17	You always snoop through other people's things?	N
454	454	454	00:29:18	00:29:19	I'm with the Crime Lab.	N
455	455	455	00:29:19	00:29:21	I'm a professional snoop.	N
456	456	456	00:29:21	00:29:23	Do you, uh...	N
457	457	457	00:29:23	00:29:25	ever wear that wig when you go out?	N
458	458	458	00:29:25	00:29:28	I never get to go out.	N
459	459	459	00:29:29	00:29:32	Two shows a night, three on weekends.	N
460	460	460	00:29:32	00:29:35	Why? You have something in mind?	N
461	461	461	00:29:35	00:29:36	Do you like the movies?	N
462	462	462	00:29:36	00:29:42	I, uh, noticed you have an Art House Theater schedule on your mirror.	N
463	463	463	00:29:42	00:29:44	Yeah, I've been there a few times.	N
464	464	464	00:29:44	00:29:46	Ever seen Strangers On A Train?	N
465	465	465	00:29:46	00:29:48	No.	N
466	466	466	00:29:48	00:29:50	Is it any good?	N
467	467	467	00:29:50	00:29:52	Yeah, it's good.	N
468	468	468	00:29:55	00:29:57	You use a lot of creams, huh?	N
469	469	469	00:29:57	00:30:02	16 shows a week in these shoes, your legs would be killing you, too.	N
470	470	470	00:30:02	00:30:03	Is that your own recipe?	N
471	471	471	00:30:04	00:30:06	What was it you said you do for a living?	N
472	472	472	00:30:06	00:30:08	I'm a scientist.	N
473	473	473	00:30:08	00:30:13	And, um, I'm up in five minutes, so... you mind?	N
474	474	474	00:30:13	00:30:15	I don't mind.	N
475	475	475	00:30:24	00:30:25	I'm sorry I'm late.	N
476	476	476	00:30:25	00:30:26	What bullet are you on?	N
477	477	477	00:30:26	00:30:29	109, finally.	N
478	478	478	00:30:29	00:30:32	Height, distance, angle.	N
479	479	479	00:30:32	00:30:33	This has been a very laborious shift.	N
480	480	480	00:30:33	00:30:35	Are you in the mood for a light show?	N
481	481	481	00:30:35	00:30:37	Yeah, hook it up.	N
482	482	482	00:30:41	00:30:44	The trajectory is all pointing in one uniform area.	N
483	483	483	00:30:44	00:30:46	Looks like some kind of a pole.	N
484	484	484	00:30:46	00:30:48	Or a bamboo stick.	N
485	485	485	00:30:49	00:30:51	The whole case has been like this.	N
486	486	486	00:30:51	00:30:53	It's like you can't wrap your head around it, you know?	N
487	487	487	00:30:53	00:31:02	A bamboo cane with black swirls descending downward, no GSR, 109 rods, 109 bullets, all fired from the same gun.	N
488	488	488	00:31:02	00:31:10	Camera glass, blood droplets everywhere, DNA that says five people were there, one boy's dead, one boy's injured, and he ain't sayin' nothin'...	N
489	489	489	00:31:11	00:31:12	Is this the end of the road?	N
490	490	490	00:31:12	00:31:14	Forensically?	N
491	491	491	00:31:14	00:31:16	Yes.	N
492	492	492	00:31:19	00:31:20	Hey.	N
493	493	493	00:31:20	00:31:22	Hey, Sara, I was just coming to get you.	N
494	494	494	00:31:22	00:31:24	Surveillance footage from Jenko Liquor.	N
495	495	495	00:31:24	00:31:26	Archie just put together some black-and-white stills.	N
496	496	496	00:31:26	00:31:27	Check it out.	N
497	497	497	00:31:27	00:31:29	Kevin, the older brother, buying beer.	N
498	498	498	00:31:29	00:31:31	Looks like he wasn't alone.	N
499	499	499	00:31:31	00:31:33	No, you're right.	N
500	500	500	00:31:33	00:31:35	He had four other friends with him, including Timmy.	N
501	501	501	00:31:35	00:31:36	And here you go.	N
502	502	502	00:31:39	00:31:41	It's a classic distraction technique.	N
503	503	503	00:31:41	00:31:42	Did it many times.	N
504	504	504	00:31:42	00:31:44	You go in with a group of buddies and you cause a little ruckus.	N
505	505	505	00:31:45	00:31:45	Store owner gets flustered.	N
506	506	506	00:31:46	00:31:47	He wants the kids out of his store.	N
507	507	507	00:31:47	00:31:50	So, he sells them the beer, even though they're underage, and of course they drink it.	N
508	508	508	00:31:50	00:31:52	Well, you know about the camera glass Warrick found, right?	N
509	509	509	00:31:52	00:31:54	That means someone has this all on tape.	N
510	510	510	00:31:54	00:31:58	I say we track down the other kids, see which one of them thinks he's Tarantino.	N
511	511	511	00:32:03	00:32:07	So, get this-- Anthony Haines had a sexual harassment suit filed against him recently.	N
512	512	512	00:32:07	00:32:09	There's a lot of that going around.	N
513	513	513	00:32:09	00:32:11	Uh-huh, from one of the showgirls.	N
514	514	514	00:32:11	00:32:14	Kelly Goodson?	N
515	515	515	00:32:14	00:32:19	She claims that he threatened to fire her if she didn't perform certain sexual favors.	N
516	516	516	00:32:19	00:32:24	You know, she had a business card in her locker-- Langly &amp;amp; Langly, Attorneys-at-Law.	N
517	517	517	00:32:24	00:32:26	It'd be interesting to find out...	N
518	518	518	00:32:26	00:32:28	If Audrey hired the same firm?	N
519	519	519	00:32:28	00:32:29	She did.	N
520	520	520	00:32:31	00:32:33	So, they liked the same movies...	N
521	521	521	00:32:33	00:32:34	they had the same problem...	N
522	522	522	00:32:34	00:32:36	and they hired the same lawyer?	N
523	523	523	00:32:36	00:32:39	Knees bothering you?	N
524	524	524	00:32:43	00:32:48	The extension cord used to strangle Audrey Hilden.	N
525	525	525	00:32:48	00:32:51	The dentist's gold chain.	N
526	526	526	00:32:51	00:32:53	The murderer's gloves.	N
527	527	527	00:32:53	00:32:58	Well, any physical evidence on those gloves would've been compromised by the ammonia.	N
528	528	528	00:32:58	00:33:01	Only on the inside; not necessarily the outside.	N
529	529	529	00:33:01	00:33:05	You use two hands to put on gloves.	N
530	530	530	00:33:05	00:33:06	You're looking for transfer.	N
531	531	531	00:33:07	00:33:09	Special recipe.	N
532	532	532	00:33:46	00:33:50	We go to the warehouse all the time...	N
533	533	533	00:33:50	00:33:53	just go there to party, talk about chicks.	N
534	534	534	00:33:53	00:33:56	Sometimes we smoke out.	N
535	535	535	00:33:56	00:33:58	You take off your shirt, please?	N
536	536	536	00:34:11	00:34:14	I ride BMX bikes...	N
537	537	537	00:34:14	00:34:15	play soccer.	N
538	538	538	00:34:15	00:34:17	Man, I wake up with bruises.	N
539	539	539	00:34:17	00:34:19	We were just messing around.	N
540	540	540	00:34:19	00:34:20	I'm not. A kid's dead.	N
541	541	541	00:34:20	00:34:22	Back to the question.	N
542	542	542	00:34:22	00:34:23	How'd you get the shiner?	N
543	543	543	00:34:24	00:34:27	JJ found a gun in North Town.	N
544	544	544	00:34:27	00:34:30	We were messing with it, shooting the walls.	N
545	545	545	00:34:30	00:34:36	So, one night, I brought my hi-eight camera in, and one of the stray bullets shot my lens out.	N
546	546	546	00:34:38	00:34:40	Who was the shooter?	N
547	547	547	00:34:42	00:34:46	You can tell us and save yourself, or you can let the tape tell us.	N
548	548	548	00:34:46	00:34:48	It's your call.	N
549	549	549	00:34:48	00:34:49	What up?	N
550	550	550	00:34:49	00:34:51	My name's Kevin.	N
551	551	551	00:34:51	00:34:55	These are my boys-- JJ, Earl, Zach, and my little bro Timmy, and this is called...	N
552	552	552	00:34:55	00:34:57	Speedway surfing!	N
553	553	553	00:34:59	00:35:01	Timmy was a big fan of all those reality shows.	N
554	554	554	00:35:01	00:35:04	You know, the don't try this at home stuff.	N
555	555	555	00:35:04	00:35:07	We-We all watched it on TV.	N
556	556	556	00:35:07	00:35:09	So, one day, we're bored.	N
557	557	557	00:35:09	00:35:14	We started making up stunts on our own, trying to outdo each other.	N
558	558	558	00:35:14	00:35:18	Speedway surfing...	N
559	559	559	00:35:18	00:35:19	that was my idea.	N
560	560	560	00:35:21	00:35:23	Come on, hit it!	N
561	561	561	00:35:23	00:35:25	Yeah! Whoo!	N
562	562	562	00:35:27	00:35:29	Whoo!	N
563	563	563	00:35:32	00:35:33	We all did it.	N
564	564	564	00:35:33	00:35:35	Some ate it bad.	N
565	565	565	00:35:35	00:35:37	JJ bruised his tailbone.	N
566	566	566	00:35:40	00:35:42	We were just messing around.	N
567	567	567	00:35:45	00:35:46	Whoo!	N
568	568	568	00:35:49	00:35:51	Then Zach got the fever.	N
569	569	569	00:35:51	00:35:54	Next day, he came up with one.	N
570	570	570	00:35:54	00:35:55	The Human...	N
571	571	571	00:35:55	00:35:57	150-Yard Marker.	N
572	572	572	00:35:58	00:36:01	Ready, boys?	N
573	573	573	00:36:01	00:36:03	Suck it up, big boy.	N
574	574	574	00:36:07	00:36:09	Then it came time for Timmy's turn.	N
575	575	575	00:36:12	00:36:15	He stayed up all night...	N
576	576	576	00:36:15	00:36:18	and by morning he had it.	N
577	577	577	00:36:19	00:36:22	Hi. My name is Timmy McCallum, and this is my debut stunt, so I'm really psyched.	N
578	578	578	00:36:22	00:36:23	It's called...	N
579	579	579	00:36:23	00:36:25	Bamboo Russian Roulette!	N
580	580	580	00:36:25	00:36:26	You ready?	N
581	581	581	00:36:29	00:36:30	Whoo!	N
582	582	582	00:36:30	00:36:32	We did it a bunch of times.	N
583	583	583	00:36:32	00:36:36	You know, we all took turns going up on the roof.	N
584	584	584	00:36:36	00:36:40	We almost stopped when I got shot in the arm...	N
585	585	585	00:36:40	00:36:43	but we were drunk, and so...	N
586	586	586	00:36:45	00:36:47	...we decided to try it one more time.	N
587	587	587	00:36:47	00:36:49	Yeah!	N
588	588	588	00:36:57	00:36:59	Whoo!	N
589	589	589	00:37:11	00:37:14	He kept trying to breathe.	N
590	590	590	00:37:14	00:37:16	I didn't know what to do.	N
591	591	591	00:37:18	00:37:20	I came down from the roof.	N
592	592	592	00:37:20	00:37:21	I went over to his side.	N
593	593	593	00:37:25	00:37:30	I kept saying... Come on, breathe, bro.	N
594	594	594	00:37:30	00:37:32	You can't die on me, man.	N
595	595	595	00:37:38	00:37:40	Why didn't you call an ambulance?	N
596	596	596	00:37:40	00:37:43	I didn't want to get in trouble.	N
597	597	597	00:37:43	00:37:45	So, you just left him for dead?	N
598	598	598	00:37:45	00:37:47	It was an accident.	N
599	599	599	00:37:49	00:37:52	It's not like we had a death wish.	N
600	600	600	00:37:52	00:37:54	You sure about that?	N
601	601	601	00:38:01	00:38:02	Langly &amp; Langly.	N
602	602	602	00:38:02	00:38:03	Mm.	N
603	603	603	00:38:04	00:38:05	I'm sorry?	N
604	604	604	00:38:05	00:38:11	Oh, it's the law firm that both you and Audrey hired to deal with your problems-- Gus Sugarman and Anthony Haines.	N
605	605	605	00:38:12	00:38:16	Tony Haines is a pig... but who's Gus?	N
606	606	606	00:38:16	00:38:21	Well, we're guessing that that's where the two of you first met, at the lawyers'.	N
607	607	607	00:38:21	00:38:23	Or they could've met at the movie theater.	N
608	608	608	00:38:23	00:38:25	Right. Right.	N
609	609	609	00:38:25	00:38:27	I mean, either way, you ladies had a lot in common.	N
610	610	610	00:38:33	00:38:36	Boy, can't you see them watching Strangers on a Train together?	N
611	611	611	00:38:36	00:38:38	Oh, yeah.	N
612	612	612	00:38:38	00:38:44	I'm thinking that Audrey told her everything about her dentist, and she told Audrey everything about Haines.	N
613	613	613	00:38:49	00:38:51	You needed them both dead.	N
614	614	614	00:38:51	00:39:08	So, right out of Strangers on a Train, if you swapped murders, no one could tie you to the victims, and then you started talking specifics-- where the best place would be to kill Haines...	N
615	615	615	00:39:08	00:39:14	someplace dark, secluded-- the parking lot right here at the Sphere.	N
616	616	616	00:39:19	00:39:25	After you stabbed Sugarman, you ripped the gold chain off of his neck as proof that you'd kept up your end of the bargain.	N
617	617	617	00:39:33	00:39:37	And then you walked out into the lobby and called Audrey on the pay phone, to say that the deed was done.	N
618	618	618	00:39:38	00:39:42	And then Audrey called Sugarman three times in a row to see if it was true.	N
619	619	619	00:39:42	00:39:45	She was the one who picked the movie...	N
620	620	620	00:39:45	00:39:46	and made the date.	N
621	621	621	00:39:48	00:39:51	But that's all she did, isn't it?	N
622	622	622	00:39:51	00:39:55	'Cause just like in the movie, she had no intention of killing Haines...	N
623	623	623	00:39:55	00:39:58	and that's when you started harassing her.	N
624	624	624	00:40:04	00:40:05	You'd killed for her.	N
625	625	625	00:40:05	00:40:08	Now she wasn't holding up her end of the bargain.	N
626	626	626	00:40:08	00:40:10	You couldn't let her betray you.	N
627	627	627	00:40:10	00:40:12	So, unfortunately, she had to die, too.	N
628	628	628	00:40:24	00:40:31	So, you made it look like she'd committed suicide, and then you planted Sugarman's gold chain, in hopes that we would think that she killed him, too.	N
629	629	629	00:40:31	00:40:35	The only thing that she had on you was that movie schedule.	N
630	630	630	00:40:35	00:40:36	That had to go.	N
631	631	631	00:40:40	00:40:43	Wow...	N
632	632	632	00:40:43	00:40:45	that is a really good story.	N
633	633	633	00:40:45	00:40:48	You guys must be movie fans yourselves.	N
634	634	634	00:40:48	00:40:50	You're right.	N
635	635	635	00:40:50	00:40:52	It's just a story...	N
636	636	636	00:40:53	00:41:02	...but the chemicals that we found on your gloves and on the extension cord that was used to kill Audrey, that's our proof.	N
637	637	637	00:41:02	00:41:06	Menthol... trolamine salicylate...	N
638	638	638	00:41:06	00:41:09	capsaicin...	N
639	639	639	00:41:12	00:41:15	Eucalyptabalm...	N
640	640	640	00:41:15	00:41:17	Isorcreme...	N
641	641	641	00:41:17	00:41:23	capsaicin ointment-- a unique concoction-- your unique concoction...	N
642	642	642	00:41:25	00:41:28	...and this stuff is all over the evidence.	N
643	643	643	00:41:28	00:41:30	Yeah...	N
644	644	644	00:41:30	00:41:33	it's a pretty good movie.	N
645	645	645	00:41:33	00:41:38	Well, the character that you've been playing, the character that Robert Walker played in the movie...	N
646	646	646	00:41:38	00:41:42	he dies at the end.	N
647	647	647	00:41:52	00:41:55	I said he'd be alone.	N
648	648	648	00:41:55	00:41:58	Hi.	N
649	649	649	00:41:58	00:42:02	What'd I miss?	N
650	650	650	00:42:02	00:42:06	Murder, seduction, deceit-- the usual.	N
651	651	651	00:42:06	00:42:07	Mm.	N
652	652	652	00:42:07	00:42:11	This one of your favorites?	N
653	653	653	00:42:11	00:42:14	Actually, I'm not a big fan of noir.	N
654	654	654	00:42:16	00:42:20	Okay.	N
655	655	655	00:42:20	00:42:26	Well, what do you like?	N
656	656	656	00:42:26	00:42:36	I like silent movies.	N
