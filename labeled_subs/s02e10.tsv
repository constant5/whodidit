185	185	185	00:15:30	00:15:33	- I'm not one for brothers, but... damn! - His name.	N
186	186	186	00:15:36	00:15:38	Keith Driscoll.	N
187	187	187	00:15:38	00:15:42	- Now you tell me to get involved. - Evidence against her isn't good.	N
188	188	188	00:15:42	00:15:44	Hey, listen. Nothing places her at the murder.	N
189	189	189	00:15:44	00:15:48	She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later?	N
190	190	190	00:15:48	00:15:50	A BS chip scam? A lousy alibi?	N
191	191	191	00:15:50	00:15:54	Vega's on it. He'll find your boyfriend. If I know my daughter, that's your shooter.	N
192	192	192	00:15:54	00:15:58	Brass, it's a big city.	N
193	193	193	00:15:58	00:16:00	Boyfriend could disappear.	N
194	194	194	00:16:00	00:16:03	But, hey, it's your kid.	N
195	195	195	00:16:08	00:16:11	Left scope is a government-issued $100 bill.	N
196	196	196	00:16:11	00:16:13	Right scope is the money from your tourists.	N
197	197	197	00:16:13	00:16:15	It confirms what you saw with the naked eye.	N
198	198	198	00:16:15	00:16:22	On a genuine bill The United States Of America is written in micro-letters on the border of Ben Franklin's portrait.	N
199	199	199	00:16:23	00:16:26	On the Ortons' bill, the intaglio script is blurred out.	N
200	200	200	00:16:27	00:16:31	Microprinting. A trick the Treasury uses to thwart photocopying a US bill.	N
201	201	201	00:16:31	00:16:37	What about pigmentation? Treasury seals and serial numbers... are the same colour, right?	N
202	202	202	00:16:37	00:16:40	They are on the bill on your left.	N
203	203	203	00:16:40	00:16:46	So the numbers on the right didn't hold the green ink No printer on the market can make a true green.	N
204	204	204	00:16:46	00:16:48	Blue and yellow hues always bleed in.	N
205	205	205	00:16:49	00:16:50	Our monetary system depends on it.	N
206	206	206	00:16:52	00:16:54	Who do we notify? The Treasury?	N
207	207	207	00:16:54	00:16:57	Secret Service Branch. They have a field office in Vegas.	N
208	208	208	00:16:57	00:16:59	I'll put these back in the evidence room.	N
209	209	209	00:17:01	00:17:06	Wait till the Ortons find out what we do with counterfeit money.	N
210	210	210	00:17:17	00:17:20	Nothing.	N
211	211	211	00:17:20	00:17:21	Told you I was clean.	N
212	212	212	00:17:21	00:17:24	So, you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?	N
213	213	213	00:17:24	00:17:25	Boss?	N
214	214	214	00:17:25	00:17:30	Do you realise, every time you ingest one of those pellets, you risk dying of an overdose?	N
215	215	215	00:17:30	00:17:35	Only if I eat. Releases gastric acids. Blah, blah, blah.	N
216	216	216	00:17:35	00:17:36	So, you can just not eat.	N
217	217	217	00:17:37	00:17:40	You see, the thing with me is, I'm... mind over matter.	N
218	218	218	00:17:42	00:17:46	I can imagine a hamburger and... I'm full.	N
219	219	219	00:17:49	00:17:51	Will you fill me up, Warrick?	N
220	220	220	00:17:57	00:17:59	I don't think I can handle this.	N
221	221	221	00:17:59	00:18:02	- I gotta call Grissom. - Then call him.	N
222	222	222	00:18:02	00:18:04	But?	N
223	223	223	00:18:04	00:18:07	- I didn't say anything. - I heard it, bro, a but in there.	N
224	224	224	00:18:07	00:18:13	You know how Grissom is. If you ask him for the keys to the car, he's gonna ask you if you've done your homework.	N
225	225	225	00:18:13	00:18:15	Yeah. That's what I was thinking.	N
226	226	226	00:18:15	00:18:19	It's like a multiple-choice question. You know? You go with your first choice.	N
227	227	227	00:18:19	00:18:22	- Sack up. - Sack up.	N
228	228	228	00:18:37	00:18:39	So did Warrick tell you to call me?	N
229	229	229	00:18:39	00:18:41	You think you're my only friend in the PD?	N
230	230	230	00:18:41	00:18:43	I'm just telling you to be careful.	N
231	231	231	00:18:43	00:18:46	Am I supposed to hold my breath and count to ten?	N
232	232	232	00:18:46	00:18:50	Hey, look. We all get a little crazy when our kids are involved.	N
233	233	233	00:18:50	00:18:53	Look, I'm on the job. It's standard police work.	N
234	234	234	00:18:53	00:18:55	Enjoy Reno. I got this.	N
235	235	235	00:18:55	00:19:04	OK. Hey, but listen, if you find the boyfriend, don't go it alone Don't worry, I won't.	N
236	236	236	00:19:05	00:19:07	Dispatch. Navaho 4-1-9-7.	N
237	237	237	00:19:07	00:19:11	In pursuit of a '78 red Camaro. Suspect wanted for questioning.	N
238	238	238	00:19:40	00:19:42	Which one's Keith Driscoll?	N
239	239	239	00:19:42	00:19:45	I was just hitchhiking. I told the guy to let me out.	N
240	240	240	00:19:45	00:19:47	Get lost.	N
241	241	241	00:19:48	00:19:50	OK come on! Out!	N
242	242	242	00:19:50	00:19:53	- Easy, man! - I'm only gonna ask you once.	N
243	243	243	00:19:53	00:19:56	- What are you and Ellie into? - What do you mean?	N
244	244	244	00:19:56	00:19:59	You got her muling drugs from Mexico. You got her mixed up in a homicide.	N
245	245	245	00:19:59	00:20:03	You got it backwards, man. She turned me on to coke so I could stud for her.	N
246	246	246	00:20:05	00:20:07	You can't just shoot me, man.	N
247	247	247	00:20:15	00:20:17	Brass.	N
248	248	248	00:20:17	00:20:18	Yo, Jim.	N
249	249	249	00:20:19	00:20:21	- We got it. - Everything's cool.	N
250	250	250	00:20:21	00:20:24	This guy was gonna kill me, man. He pulled his gun.	N
251	251	251	00:20:24	00:20:26	I'm sure the officer felt his life was in danger, sir.	N
252	252	252	00:20:26	00:20:29	We wanna question you about the murder of Vincent Avery.	N
253	253	253	00:20:29	00:20:33	- I'm not riding with him. - You're right, you're not.	N
254	254	254	00:20:50	00:20:53	What do you mean, you can't give it back? It's all we have for our vacation.	N
255	255	255	00:20:53	00:20:57	Well, it's counterfeit. We have to take it out of circulation.	N
256	256	256	00:20:57	00:20:59	What?	N
257	257	257	00:21:00	00:21:04	Mr Orton, you don't look so surprised.	N
258	258	258	00:21:04	00:21:05	Matt? Honey?	N
259	259	259	00:21:05	00:21:09	I went to the gas station. The attendant said the hundred I had was phoney.	N
260	260	260	00:21:09	00:21:14	So I went to our branch bank here and I tried to exchange it, but they couldn't do it.	N
261	261	261	00:21:14	00:21:19	I mean, why would anybody turn in bad money if they can't get reimbursed for it?	N
262	262	262	00:21:19	00:21:28	Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 473 of the United States Code, punishable by up to 15 years for knowingly passing on bad money.	N
263	263	263	00:21:28	00:21:32	- Oh, my God! - I just didn't wanna get stuck holding the bag.	N
264	264	264	00:21:32	00:21:33	Do you have a $20 bill?	N
265	265	265	00:21:34	00:21:36	Our wallets are up in the room.	N
266	266	266	00:21:36	00:21:37	I may have something.	N
267	267	267	00:21:39	00:21:41	Hm. You see the ghost?	N
268	268	268	00:21:42	00:21:45	Right there on the right.	N
269	269	269	00:21:45	00:21:48	- Oh, yeah. - They're embedded to prevent forgeries.	N
270	270	270	00:21:48	00:21:53	You should see Lincoln on the five. He looks really stressed out.	N
271	271	271	00:21:53	00:21:55	I wish I had met you last week.	N
272	272	272	00:21:55	00:22:00	A special agent from Secret Service wants to talk to you about the final deposition of this case.	N
273	273	273	00:22:08	00:22:10	Warrick Brown?	N
274	274	274	00:22:10	00:22:12	Special Agent Beckman, Treasury Department.	N
275	275	275	00:22:12	00:22:14	- Subbing in tonight, right? - Treasury Department?	N
276	276	276	00:22:14	00:22:17	We wanted to be sure CSI's on the same page on this counterfeit case.	N
277	277	277	00:22:17	00:22:20	- Counterfeit? - Our lab wants to analyse that money too.	N
278	278	278	00:22:20	00:22:23	- What money? - I didn't wanna interrupt you.	N
279	279	279	00:22:23	00:22:29	- On a federal case. - Agent Beckman, I'm Sara Sidle Could you excuse us for a minute?	N
280	280	280	00:22:31	00:22:36	Warrick, you gotta turn on your pager, man. I got Brass's daughter's car in the garage.	N
281	281	281	00:22:36	00:22:39	- I'm dealing with something. - That's why I didn't bring this to you.	N
282	282	282	00:22:40	00:22:43	Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect for more than a half-hour.	N
283	283	283	00:22:43	00:22:45	Did Sidle hold back information?	N
284	284	284	00:22:45	00:22:47	I didn't not tell him.	N
285	285	285	00:22:47	00:22:51	- I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom. - Well, I'm not Grissom!	N
286	286	286	00:22:52	00:22:54	Guys.	N
287	287	287	00:22:55	00:22:57	I didn't say it.	N
288	288	288	00:22:59	00:23:05	Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman on the funny money. Nick, garage.	N
289	289	289	00:23:10	00:23:50	Time Has Come Today Young hearts can go that way Can't put it off another day I don't care what others say They say we don't listen anyway Time has come today Oh, the rules have changed today I have no place to stay Hey!	N
290	290	290	00:23:50	00:23:53	Thinking about the subway Hey!	N
291	291	291	00:23:53	00:23:57	The love has flown away Hey!	N
292	292	292	00:23:57	00:24:01	My tears have come and gone Hey!	N
293	293	293	00:24:01	00:24:05	Oh, my Lord, I have to roam Hey!	N
294	294	294	00:24:05	00:24:08	I have no home Hey!	N
295	295	295	00:24:08	00:24:13	I have no home Hey!	N
296	296	296	00:24:18	00:24:20	Tyre plug.	N
297	297	297	00:24:20	00:24:22	That's a nail in sheep's clothing.	N
298	298	298	00:24:24	00:24:26	Treads from the crime scene.	N
299	299	299	00:24:27	00:24:31	The void on the one-to-one matches the void on Ellie's left rear tyre.	N
300	300	300	00:24:32	00:24:34	Siamese twins.	N
301	301	301	00:24:34	00:24:37	Proves one thing. This was the getaway car used in the murder.	N
302	302	302	00:24:38	00:24:39	Yeah.	N
303	303	303	00:24:41	00:24:43	We printed the vehicle your client was found driving.	N
304	304	304	00:24:44	00:24:47	It puts the car at the scene of Avery's murder less than 12 hours ago.	N
305	305	305	00:24:47	00:24:51	Come off it. The car's not even registered to him.	N
306	306	306	00:24:51	00:24:53	No. The girl he bought tickets to Baja for.	N
307	307	307	00:24:53	00:24:55	He bought tickets for Avery as well.	N
308	308	308	00:24:55	00:25:00	The tickets were bought with your credit card, but we have no proof he ever went down there.	N
309	309	309	00:25:00	00:25:02	- He's generous - Till Avery made him mad.	N
310	310	310	00:25:02	00:25:05	You wanna talk about the gun your captain pulled on my client?	N
311	311	311	00:25:05	00:25:09	An unarmed man. That's got PD brutality written all over it.	N
312	312	312	00:25:09	00:25:11	Vega?	N
313	313	313	00:25:11	00:25:13	Safety precaution only.	N
314	314	314	00:25:16	00:25:19	- We're done. - Let's go.	N
315	315	315	00:25:26	00:25:29	You suspect them of a high-end counterfeit operation?	N
316	316	316	00:25:29	00:25:32	No, but it did get me thinking.	N
317	317	317	00:25:32	00:25:34	If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.	N
318	318	318	00:25:35	00:25:38	Take a look. This is the money that we got from the con man.	N
319	319	319	00:25:38	00:25:41	See the serial numbers? Each one is different.	N
320	320	320	00:25:46	00:25:50	- Just like real money. - That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent.	N
321	321	321	00:25:50	00:25:54	This couple didn't make one bill and run 100 copies with the same serial number.	N
322	322	322	00:26:01	00:26:03	They had to burn separate plates for each number.	N
323	323	323	00:26:08	00:26:10	Much harder to catch.	N
324	324	324	00:26:11	00:26:13	The very high end.	N
325	325	325	00:26:13	00:26:15	The Duffys are major counterfeiters.	N
326	326	326	00:26:15	00:26:17	You mean the Ortons.	N
327	327	327	00:26:17	00:26:21	My investigators tell me they're the Duffys from Las Vegas County.	N
328	328	328	00:26:21	00:26:22	Orton's their assumed names.	N
329	329	329	00:26:23	00:26:24	How long have you known that?	N
330	330	330	00:26:24	00:26:27	I went on the T-Department database.	N
331	331	331	00:26:27	00:26:31	They've each done time for fraud. And, yes, high-end counterfeiting.	N
332	332	332	00:26:31	00:26:34	- You federal guys are sneaky. - Access.	N
333	333	333	00:26:34	00:26:36	So, what do you wanna do with the money?	N
334	334	334	00:26:36	00:26:40	It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.	N
335	335	335	00:26:42	00:26:44	Thanks. I'll take it from here.	N
336	336	336	00:26:44	00:26:46	Find the operation and shut it down.	N
337	337	337	00:26:46	00:26:48	Hey!	N
338	338	338	00:26:49	00:26:52	- I'm still part of this. - Not really.	N
339	339	339	00:26:52	00:26:55	But you're making me look good, so if you wanna tag along...	N
340	340	340	00:26:55	00:26:58	- I don't tag along. - Suit yourself.	N
341	341	341	00:27:05	00:27:10	We got bad news from the garage Give it to me.	N
342	342	342	00:27:10	00:27:13	The tyre evidence puts Ellie's car at the murder scene.	N
343	343	343	00:27:13	00:27:17	- We'll be pressing charges for Avery's murder. - Come on. You know she didn't kill him.	N
344	344	344	00:27:17	00:27:21	- Keith Driscoll did. - Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.	N
345	345	345	00:27:21	00:27:24	- What? - Vega had to let him go after your gun episode.	N
346	346	346	00:27:24	00:27:27	Oh, I get it. Vega thinks she'll eventually rat out Driscoll.	N
347	347	347	00:27:28	00:27:33	- That's what you cops think. - Let me tell you something about my daughter.	N
348	348	348	00:27:33	00:27:34	Never happen.	N
349	349	349	00:27:49	00:27:52	- Are they arresting me? - I'm gonna bail you out.	N
350	350	350	00:27:53	00:27:55	You can stay at my place.	N
351	351	351	00:27:55	00:27:56	I have a place.	N
352	352	352	00:27:56	00:27:58	You have a place?	N

444	444	444	00:35:18	00:35:20	With a pinch on his hand.	N

458	458	458	00:36:35	00:36:37	- With his firearm. - That was you in the other room.	N
459	459	459	00:36:40	00:36:41	I think I killed him.	N

464	464	464	00:37:00	00:37:04	She's supposed to be in jail for shooting Avery at the casino.	N
465	465	465	00:37:06	00:37:08	- Urgh! - You eat something?	N
466	466	466	00:37:08	00:37:10	I took a laxative.	N
467	467	467	00:37:10	00:37:13	Oh, God. He's gonna OD.	N
468	468	468	00:37:13	00:37:15	Can we get a medic?	N
469	469	469	00:37:16	00:37:18	Can we get a medic?	N
470	470	470	00:37:19	00:37:20	Brass!	N

476	476	476	00:37:55	00:37:58	I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it.	N
477	477	477	00:37:58	00:37:59	That's it.	N
478	478	478	00:38:00	00:38:02	A man's gotta do...	N
479	479	479	00:38:05	00:38:07	What is it, Rick?	N
480	480	480	00:38:08	00:38:11	We were checking out the blood from your gun.	N

482	482	482	00:38:15	00:38:18	You never said anything about her being adopted.	N
483	483	483	00:38:24	00:38:26	She's not.	N
