1	00:01:03	00:01:05	Call said one dead body.	N
2	00:01:05	00:01:06	Caught him red-handed.	N
3	00:01:06	00:01:08	Ben Jennings.	N
4	00:01:12	00:01:14	Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
5	00:01:14	00:01:16	You want to tell us what's going on?	N
6	00:01:16	00:01:18	What happened here?	N
7	00:01:20	00:01:22	You have anything to say?	N
8	00:01:24	00:01:27	You don't have to talk to us.	N
9	00:01:28	00:01:30	He'll talk to us.	N
10	00:02:07	00:02:09	See that lividity?	N
11	00:02:09	00:02:12	Blood settled at the time of death.	N
12	00:02:12	00:02:15	Body's been moved from the murder scene.	N
13	00:02:15	00:02:16	Impound his car.	N
14	00:02:16	00:02:19	Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork.	N
15	00:02:19	00:02:21	My bad, Sara.	N
16	00:02:21	00:02:26	Let's process this guy shall we?	N
17	00:02:26	00:02:29	Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!	N
18	00:02:37	00:02:39	Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner.	N
19	00:02:41	00:02:42	Arms out, away from your body.	N
20	00:02:42	00:02:45	That's it. Stay just like that.	N
21	00:02:52	00:02:53	Give me your right foot.	N
22	00:02:53	00:02:55	Other right.	N
23	00:02:56	00:02:56	Put it down.	N
24	00:02:57	00:02:58	Lift it up.	N
25	00:02:59	00:03:01	Hold still.	N
26	00:03:03	00:03:07	Possible secondary transfer.	N
27	00:03:09	00:03:11	Got some red fibers.	N
28	00:03:14	00:03:15	Other foot.	N
29	00:03:15	00:03:16	Lift it up.	N
30	00:03:16	00:03:17	Put it down.	N
31	00:03:22	00:03:23	No defensive wounds.	N
32	00:03:23	00:03:26	No hematomas.	N
33	00:03:26	00:03:28	Victim didn't fight back.	N
34	00:03:28	00:03:29	Probably didn't see it coming.	N
35	00:03:32	00:03:33	Matthew...	N
36	00:03:34	00:03:36	tag that body for special processing, VIP room.	N
37	00:03:36	00:03:40	Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails.	N
38	00:03:50	00:03:54	D.B., Mediterranean Casino, Women's Spa.	N
39	00:03:56	00:03:58	Body is Shelley Danvers.	N
40	00:03:58	00:04:01	10/10/81.	N
41	00:04:01	00:04:03	Employee walked in to get towels...	N
42	00:04:06	00:04:08	found her here.	N
43	00:04:15	00:04:21	A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFOs?	N
44	00:04:23	00:04:24	Done fell out.	N
45	00:04:24	00:04:26	That's what the night manager says.	N
46	00:04:29	00:04:30	Miss?	N
47	00:04:34	00:04:36	We're from the Crime Lab.	N
48	00:04:36	00:04:39	You found the deceased?	N
49	00:04:39	00:04:42	Yes, I was, um...	N
50	00:04:42	00:04:45	just getting some towels and I walked in and she was there.	N
51	00:04:45	00:04:47	Hey, Brass...	N
52	00:04:47	00:04:48	you touch this body?	N
53	00:04:48	00:04:50	Yeah, I was born yesterday.	N
54	00:04:50	00:04:55	Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.	N
55	00:04:55	00:04:57	Miss...	N
56	00:04:57	00:05:00	you know anything about redressing the body?	N
57	00:05:00	00:05:01	Well, she was naked.	N
58	00:05:01	00:05:03	I-I-I thought she should be covered.	N
59	00:05:03	00:05:06	Did you move the body here, too?	N
60	00:05:06	00:05:08	Guests were looking in.	N
61	00:05:08	00:05:09	I put a robe on her.	N
62	00:05:09	00:05:12	It's not like it's a crime or anything.	N
63	00:05:12	00:05:14	Actually, it is.	N
64	00:05:14	00:05:17	Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.	N
65	00:05:22	00:05:23	Flour, maybe?	N
66	00:05:23	00:05:25	But what kind?	N
67	00:05:25	00:05:27	All-purpose?	N
68	00:05:27	00:05:29	Self-rising?	N
69	00:05:29	00:05:30	Pastry?	N
70	00:05:30	00:05:33	Trace will probably have a better idea.	N
71	00:05:35	00:05:39	I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.	N
72	00:05:39	00:05:40	What about the neck?	N
73	00:05:40	00:05:42	Any fibers in the wound?	N
74	00:05:42	00:05:43	You told me to wait for you.	N
75	00:05:43	00:05:45	Well, that hasn't stopped you yet.	N
76	00:05:45	00:05:47	I did observe some fibers in the wound.	N
77	00:05:47	00:05:49	I didn't collect them, though.	N
78	00:05:49	00:05:51	Be my guest.	N
79	00:05:56	00:05:58	Yellow.	N
80	00:05:58	00:06:01	Not cotton; satin, maybe.	N
81	00:06:06	00:06:08	Dress shirt...	N
82	00:06:08	00:06:09	but no tie.	N
83	00:06:10	00:06:12	Strangled with his own tie?	N
84	00:06:14	00:06:16	Find me on the flour.	N
85	00:06:18	00:06:21	Shelley Danvers-- 00.	N
86	00:06:21	00:06:26	Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the Jacuzzi facilities this evening?	N
87	00:06:26	00:06:27	Not that I remember, no.	N
88	00:06:29	00:06:30	What? You don't believe me?	N
89	00:06:31	00:06:33	Well, you lied to us before.	N
90	00:06:33	00:06:36	It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a Jacuzzi.	N
91	00:06:36	00:06:38	Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under.	N
92	00:06:39	00:06:40	The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.	N
93	00:06:40	00:06:42	Well, that didn't happen here.	N
94	00:06:42	00:06:44	She did not drown on these premises.	N
95	00:06:44	00:06:50	Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.	N
96	00:06:50	00:06:54	Oliver Dunne; corporate lawyer, father of two.	N
97	00:06:54	00:06:57	You get all that from his dentals?	N
98	00:06:57	00:06:58	His wife-- widow.	N
99	00:06:58	00:07:00	She came down to I.D. his property.	N
100	00:07:00	00:07:01	.380s?	N
101	00:07:01	00:07:08	Last one I recovered entered through his abdominals pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique.	N
102	00:07:08	00:07:11	That's not what killed him, is it?	N
103	00:07:11	00:07:13	We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound.	N
104	00:07:14	00:07:15	I think it's from his tie.	N
105	00:07:15	00:07:17	You might be right.	N
106	00:07:17	00:07:19	He died of asphyxiation.	N
107	00:07:19	00:07:22	Tie probably closed the windpipe.	N
108	00:07:22	00:07:26	Without oxygen, the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up.	N
109	00:07:26	00:07:29	Whole pulmonary system shut down.	N
110	00:07:29	00:07:34	What you may have here is the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.	N
111	00:07:34	00:07:39	Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?	N
112	00:07:39	00:07:43	I cannot tell you why but I might be able to tell you where.	N
113	00:07:43	00:07:44	A pizza shop.	N
114	00:07:44	00:07:50	The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content-- seven percent protein-- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing.	N
115	00:07:51	00:07:53	So, why did you rule out bakeries?	N
116	00:07:53	00:07:55	Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype; double zero.	N
117	00:07:55	00:07:58	It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens.	N
118	00:07:58	00:08:01	Oh, and Trace picked up some oregano in the sample.	N
119	00:08:01	00:08:04	When are you set to interview Ben?	N
120	00:08:04	00:08:07	You're the registered owner of a Lorcin .380.	N
121	00:08:07	00:08:10	Takes the same caliber bullet as the slugs we took out of the victim.	N
122	00:08:11	00:08:15	So, I'm going to ask you one more time where's your gun?	N
123	00:08:15	00:08:16	I lost it.	N
124	00:08:16	00:08:18	Do you think we believe that?	N
125	00:08:18	00:08:19	Do you think...	N
126	00:08:19	00:08:20	Are you employed, Ben?	N
127	00:08:20	00:08:22	Yeah... yeah, um...	N
128	00:08:22	00:08:27	it's a place called Dante's Pizzeria.	N
129	00:08:27	00:08:28	It's behind the Strato'.	N
130	00:08:28	00:08:30	You make pizzas?	N
131	00:08:30	00:08:32	Well, I deliver the pizzas.	N
132	00:08:32	00:08:35	It's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff.	N
133	00:08:36	00:08:38	Do you, uh...	N
134	00:08:38	00:08:42	ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?	N
135	00:08:42	00:08:46	Mostly pizza boxes.	N
136	00:08:46	00:08:48	Why?	N
137	00:08:48	00:08:55	Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza.	N
138	00:08:55	00:08:57	Can you explain that?	N
139	00:08:57	00:08:59	No.	N
140	00:08:59	00:09:06	Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?	N
141	00:09:06	00:09:08	Well, I don't have to talk.	N
142	00:09:08	00:09:13	No... but we're going to figure it out.	N
143	00:09:13	00:09:16	Look, if you know so much about these murders what do you need me for?	N
144	00:09:16	00:09:18	Murders?	N
145	00:09:20	00:09:22	There are more bodies?	N
146	00:09:29	00:09:31	I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.	N
147	00:09:31	00:09:33	What is that? A beer can?	N
148	00:09:33	00:09:35	Soda can?	N
149	00:09:35	00:09:37	Zilch.	N
150	00:09:39	00:09:41	Zilch.	N
151	00:09:41	00:09:43	Don't tell me, more zilch?	N
152	00:09:43	00:09:45	Whoa... Whoa.	N
153	00:09:45	00:09:48	Point of disturbance.	N
154	00:09:48	00:09:49	Hold up.	N
155	00:09:52	00:09:54	Isolate it.	N
156	00:10:18	00:10:21	Any more bodies you want to tell me about?	N
157	00:10:23	00:10:26	No.	N
158	00:10:26	00:10:29	We're going to radar this whole hillside.	N
159	00:10:33	00:10:50	Sometimes... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body I sit in my car and it hits me-- how close I was...	N
160	00:10:50	00:10:55	how heavy the body is...	N
161	00:10:55	00:10:58	the texture of the body...	N
162	00:10:58	00:11:01	how it feels... you know?	N
163	00:11:09	00:11:11	Mr. Grissom...	N
164	00:11:14	00:11:17	I'm not a bad person.	N
165	00:11:17	00:11:19	You're not a bad person?	N
166	00:11:21	00:11:22	Then, what are you?	N
167	00:11:32	00:11:36	Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.	N
168	00:11:36	00:11:37	Yep, she's next.	N
169	00:11:37	00:11:38	Well, it's about time.	N
170	00:11:38	00:11:40	You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?	N
171	00:11:40	00:11:43	I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.	N
172	00:11:43	00:11:46	Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.	N
173	00:11:46	00:11:48	I'll take it from here, David.	N
174	00:11:48	00:11:50	Good morning.	N
175	00:11:50	00:11:52	Catherine.	N
176	00:11:52	00:11:56	No serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose.	N
177	00:11:56	00:11:57	She didn't drown?	N
178	00:11:57	00:12:00	Rules out your Jacuzzi theory.	N
179	00:12:00	00:12:02	Anything probative?	N
180	00:12:02	00:12:05	Bright red lividity extending down the body.	N
181	00:12:05	00:12:06	From?	N
182	00:12:06	00:12:08	Well, heatstroke possibly.	N
183	00:12:08	00:12:12	Stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if I'm right...	N
184	00:12:12	00:12:14	Cover-up.	N
185	00:12:14	00:12:17	Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine?	N
186	00:12:17	00:12:21	Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa-- a warrant, if we need it.	N
187	00:12:22	00:12:23	Yep, that's right.	N
188	00:12:23	00:12:25	Bye.	N
189	00:12:25	00:12:26	Oh, it's on.	N
190	00:12:26	00:12:29	Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?	N
191	00:12:29	00:12:31	Uh, yeah.	N
192	00:12:31	00:12:33	Tina... Tina Kolas.	Y
193	00:12:33	00:12:35	Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana.	N
194	00:12:35	00:12:36	Flew here in a package. Why?	N
195	00:12:36	00:12:39	We need someone to give us the truth about last night.	N
196	00:12:49	00:12:51	Gil Grissom?	N
197	00:12:51	00:12:53	Father?	N
198	00:12:53	00:12:55	Benjamin's a member of my parish.	N
199	00:12:55	00:12:56	The officer won't let me talk to him.	N
200	00:12:56	00:12:58	He said you were in charge.	N
201	00:12:58	00:13:00	Of this crime scene.	N
202	00:13:00	00:13:02	He needs spiritual guidance.	N
203	00:13:08	00:13:10	Yeah, I imagine he does.	N
204	00:13:10	00:13:14	Ah... then you'd have no problem with my talking to him.	N
205	00:13:14	00:13:15	It's the 11th hour.	N
206	00:13:15	00:13:17	I wouldn't expect anything less. 11th hour?	N
207	00:13:17	00:13:21	When the reality of their actions set in they usually turn to religion.	N
208	00:13:21	00:13:23	Can you think of a better time?	N
209	00:13:31	00:13:33	Okay, hold it.	N
210	00:13:33	00:13:34	That's enough.	N
211	00:13:34	00:13:35	Let's dust him.	N
212	00:13:52	00:13:54	No ligature marks.	N
213	00:13:54	00:13:56	Different from the first guy.	N
214	00:13:56	00:14:01	See if this laceration on this guy's forehead is consistent with the kid's shovel.	N
215	00:14:03	00:14:05	Hey...	N
216	00:14:05	00:14:06	I feel a wallet here.	N
217	00:14:12	00:14:15	Ramirez Kenny.	N
218	00:14:15	00:14:18	A 25-year-old Latino and a 42-year-old white guy?	N
219	00:14:18	00:14:20	Strangers.	N
220	00:14:20	00:14:22	Doesn't make sense. There's no connection.	N
221	00:14:22	00:14:25	Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery.	N
222	00:14:25	00:14:27	Hey, O'Riley.	N
223	00:14:27	00:14:29	What's the matter, man-- A.C. not working?	N
224	00:14:29	00:14:30	I was on with Dispatch.	N
225	00:14:30	00:14:36	Oliver Dunne's car was just found by the Highway Patrol abandoned at an AvCon station off 215.	N
226	00:14:36	00:14:41	They didn't happen to find another car there, did they?	N
227	00:14:41	00:14:43	Yeah.	N
228	00:14:43	00:14:46	Registered to a Ramirez.	N
229	00:14:46	00:14:49	Yeah... gas station.	N
230	00:14:58	00:15:05	And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night she was going to use the dry sauna?	Y
231	00:15:05	00:15:07	We'd been drinking apple martinis for three days straight.	Y
232	00:15:07	00:15:10	Shelley said the sauna would detox her you know, clean her out.	N
233	00:15:14	00:15:15	Cath.	N
234	00:15:17	00:15:18	Whose shirt is this?	N
235	00:15:18	00:15:21	Mine. Shelley and I got in a fight over it.	Y
236	00:15:21	00:15:22	When?	N
237	00:15:22	00:15:23	Yesterday.	N
238	00:15:23	00:15:31	I caught her trying it on and I said Give it back, and then we started fighting over it, you know, tug of war and the whole thing ripped right in two.	Y
239	00:15:31	00:15:32	We fell back laughing.	Y
240	00:15:35	00:15:37	I'd give anything to have her back.	Y
241	00:15:37	00:15:41	We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind.	Y
242	00:15:41	00:15:43	No, go ahead, if it'll help.	N
243	00:15:43	00:15:46	You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.	Y
244	00:15:46	00:15:48	She called down from this phone.	N
245	00:15:48	00:15:50	Do they tape phone calls here?	N
246	00:15:50	00:15:52	Hotel surveillance would love that.	N
247	00:15:52	00:15:55	You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?	Y
248	00:15:55	00:15:56	Yeah.	N
249	00:16:00	00:16:02	We're going to take this as well.	N
250	00:16:02	00:16:05	Okay... but it doesn't have anything on it.	N
251	00:16:05	00:16:07	Well, that's okay.	N
252	00:16:07	00:16:08	We do magic.	N
253	00:16:10	00:16:13	Two men were shot and killed and you didn't see anything?	N
254	00:16:13	00:16:14	Sorry.	N
255	00:16:14	00:16:17	You don't just miss something like that. What was going on?	N
256	00:16:17	00:16:19	A friend of mine came with his new car.	N
257	00:16:19	00:16:21	We took it for a drive.	N
258	00:16:21	00:16:22	I'm afraid my boss will find out.	N
259	00:16:22	00:16:23	I was only gone five minutes.	N
260	00:16:24	00:16:25	Okay, all right.	N
261	00:16:25	00:16:26	Just walk us through it.	N
262	00:16:26	00:16:28	When did you know there'd been a crime committed?	N
263	00:16:29	00:16:33	Well, my buddy dropped me back here and I noticed these two cars.	N
264	00:16:33	00:16:35	I went to check them out.	N
265	00:16:43	00:16:45	Oh, my God.	N
266	00:16:49	00:16:50	I don't see any blood.	N
267	00:16:50	00:16:51	Yeah, I hosed it down.	N
268	00:16:51	00:16:52	You what?	N
269	00:16:52	00:16:53	It was freakin' me out.	N
270	00:17:04	00:17:06	H-Hello?	N
271	00:17:06	00:17:07	Mr. Grissom?	N
272	00:17:07	00:17:09	Uh...	N
273	00:17:11	00:17:14	They told me out front I'd find you here.	N
274	00:17:18	00:17:20	I don't see your, uh... visitor's badge.	N
275	00:17:21	00:17:22	Priest's collar.	N
276	00:17:22	00:17:24	People trust it.	N
277	00:17:25	00:17:27	Most people.	N
278	00:17:27	00:17:29	Even lapsed Catholics.	N
279	00:17:29	00:17:34	What makes you think, uh... I was ever a Catholic?	N
280	00:17:34	00:17:36	First time we met, you called me Father.	N
281	00:17:36	00:17:37	Only Romans do that.	N
282	00:17:38	00:17:41	Everybody else, it's Reverend or Minister.	N
283	00:17:41	00:17:45	I wanted to know how your investigation against Ben is going.	N
284	00:17:45	00:17:46	This is his car.	N
285	00:17:47	00:17:49	You know, you really shouldn't be here.	N
286	00:17:49	00:17:52	I didn't come here to tamper with your evidence.	N
287	00:18:03	00:18:06	He was a good kid, all through school.	N
288	00:18:06	00:18:11	Still comes to Mass every Sunday.	N
289	00:18:11	00:18:14	If he has a problem...	N
290	00:18:14	00:18:15	it's trying to please people.	N
291	00:18:17	00:18:19	Is that a problem?	N
292	00:18:19	00:18:20	It can be.	N
293	00:18:31	00:18:34	This Luminol reveals any dried blood spots.	N
294	00:18:56	00:18:58	He wouldn't do this.	N
295	00:18:59	00:19:01	I believe the car.	N
296	00:19:04	00:19:09	To whom much is given, much will be expected.	N
297	00:19:12	00:19:15	I leave you to your work.	N
298	00:19:22	00:19:26	I told you we have no record Shelley Danvers specifically used the dry sauna.	N
299	00:19:26	00:19:28	That's okay, 'cause we do.	N
300	00:19:28	00:19:33	ESDA can read this blank paper see what's written on it.	N
301	00:19:33	00:19:34	Up to 14 layers.	N
302	00:19:34	00:19:37	Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.	N
303	00:19:39	00:19:41	That's Miss Danvers' handwriting.	N
304	00:19:41	00:19:42	We confirm that.	N
305	00:19:42	00:19:43	So she took a dry sauna.	N
306	00:19:43	00:19:44	What does that prove?	N
307	00:19:44	00:19:48	She died of a heat stroke.	N
308	00:19:48	00:19:52	The Coroner just called in with the results of his final post.	N
309	00:19:52	00:19:56	Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke-- 182 °F.	N
310	00:19:58	00:20:01	That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.	N
311	00:20:01	00:20:03	Especially if no one checks up on them.	N
312	00:20:03	00:20:07	A hotel employee is supposed to check on the various saunas every 15 minutes.	N
313	00:20:07	00:20:09	Hotel regulations, right?	N
314	00:20:10	00:20:16	We, uh, we got a copy of the check-up sheet.	N
315	00:20:17	00:20:23	30 p.m.	N
316	00:20:23	00:20:25	00 until...	N
317	00:20:25	00:20:27	what time did you call 9-1-1?	N
318	00:20:31	00:20:32	I, um...	N
319	00:20:32	00:20:33	I came in at closing.	N
320	00:20:33	00:20:34	00.	N
321	00:20:34	00:20:37	Miss?	N
322	00:20:37	00:20:38	Miss?	N
323	00:20:38	00:20:39	Oh, my God.	N
324	00:20:39	00:20:41	You moved her into the locker room?	N
325	00:20:42	00:20:43	Put the robe on her?	N
326	00:20:43	00:20:46	I was just trying to protect the hotel.	N
327	00:20:46	00:20:48	From negligent homicide.	N
328	00:20:48	00:20:53	They drill into us that the reputation of this hotel is everything.	N
329	00:20:53	00:20:55	Murder scene was compromised.	N
330	00:20:55	00:21:02	Pump jockey wasn't very helpful but bullets pulled from Victim One and Victim Two.	N
331	00:21:02	00:21:03	Identical striations.	N
332	00:21:03	00:21:06	Bullets in both victims were fired by the exact same weapon.	N
333	00:21:06	00:21:07	A Lorcin .380.	N
334	00:21:07	00:21:11	The same pistol registered to a Benjamin Jennings.	N
335	00:21:11	00:21:16	P.D. can prove through credit cards that Ben frequents the AvCon gas stations where both vics were killed.	N
336	00:21:16	00:21:20	And we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found.	N
337	00:21:20	00:21:21	And fibers.	N
338	00:21:23	00:21:27	I recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of Victim One.	N
339	00:21:27	00:21:29	Found the same fiber on the sock of Victim Two.	N
340	00:21:29	00:21:33	We ID'd the fibers using the FTIR.	N
341	00:21:33	00:21:35	It's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting.	N
342	00:21:35	00:21:37	So we went back to Ben's car.	N
343	00:21:40	00:21:42	They're identical.	N
344	00:21:42	00:21:44	We got the Master Standards from the car manufacturer.	N
345	00:21:44	00:21:48	The assigned name for the material is 12-ounce Merlot Trialon.	N
346	00:21:50	00:21:53	Bottom line... he killed them.	N
347	00:21:53	00:21:56	Good work, you guys.	N
348	00:21:56	00:22:00	Very good.	N
349	00:22:00	00:22:02	But you haven't proved murder.	N
350	00:22:02	00:22:03	You've proved burial.	N
351	00:22:03	00:22:05	Excuse me?	N
352	00:22:05	00:22:07	Victim blood on his clothes...	N
353	00:22:08	00:22:09	under his nails.	N
354	00:22:09	00:22:11	From burying them.	N
355	00:22:11	00:22:14	Victim blood in his car?	N
356	00:22:14	00:22:16	He transported them.	N
357	00:22:17	00:22:20	Show me the gun with Ben's prints on it.	N
358	00:22:20	00:22:23	Gun shot residue, the ligature, the...	N
359	00:22:23	00:22:26	The holes in Christ's hands, Doubting Thomas?	N
360	00:22:26	00:22:28	Yes. Empirical evidence.	N
361	00:22:28	00:22:31	St. Thomas was ahead of us all.	N
362	00:22:31	00:22:36	Does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here?	N
363	00:22:36	00:22:37	No.	N
364	00:22:37	00:22:40	It has to do with the evidence.	N
365	00:22:40	00:22:43	It's our job to present the D.A. with the best evidence possible.	N
366	00:22:43	00:22:44	Let a jury decide.	N
367	00:22:44	00:22:47	Anything else, we're playing judge.	N
368	00:22:47	00:22:51	The evidence doesn't get any better than this.	N
369	00:23:00	00:23:01	Okay. Ship it.	N
370	00:23:01	00:23:02	Show it to the D.A.	N
371	00:23:03	00:23:06	Right.	N
372	00:23:12	00:23:13	Anyone up for breakfast?	N
373	00:23:13	00:23:16	I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.	N
374	00:23:16	00:23:19	Football-- wide-screen.	N
375	00:23:19	00:23:21	Well, I guess I'll go see Tina alone.	Y
376	00:23:22	00:23:25	Hotel tells me she's down playing quarter slots.	Y
377	00:23:27	00:23:29	I thought we solved this case.	N
378	00:23:29	00:23:30	What'd you get?	N
379	00:23:30	00:23:37	Well, my guy in the hotel lounge tells me that Tina and Shelley were having a catfight over some dude named Jeremy the day she died.	Y
380	00:23:37	00:23:41	That's probably how the shirt really got ripped.	N
381	00:23:41	00:23:44	Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.	Y
382	00:23:44	00:23:46	Misunderstood the priest?	N
383	00:23:46	00:23:48	How?	N
384	00:23:48	00:23:50	I looked deeper into the evidence.	N
385	00:23:50	00:23:52	I should have looked deeper into Ben's character.	N
386	00:23:52	00:23:55	Benjamin Corey Jennings.	N
387	00:23:55	00:23:56	Nonviolent crimes.	N
388	00:23:58	00:24:01	Roger Jennings... armed robbery.	Y
389	00:24:01	00:24:07	Past convictions, breaking and entering assault with great bodily harm.	N
390	00:24:07	00:24:10	Paroled 9/27/2000.	N
391	00:24:10	00:24:12	This guy is hard-core.	Y
392	00:24:12	00:24:14	He's looking at his third strike here.	Y
393	00:24:17	00:24:19	What's going on?	N
394	00:24:23	00:24:25	You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?	N
395	00:24:25	00:24:26	Yeah.	N
396	00:24:26	00:24:29	We might have been wrong.	N
397	00:24:29	00:24:31	Tell me about your brother.	Y
398	00:24:36	00:24:38	We know that you only buried the bodies.	N
399	00:24:38	00:24:41	So, what happened?	N
400	00:24:43	00:24:45	Did he threaten you?	Y
401	00:24:49	00:24:51	Ben?	N
402	00:25:11	00:25:13	Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison, Roger?	N
403	00:25:16	00:25:19	Who the hell are you guys?	N
404	00:25:19	00:25:21	Get out of my kitchen.	Y
405	00:25:21	00:25:25	Roger Jennings-- armed robbery, breaking and entering.	N
406	00:25:25	00:25:28	You sound like the kind of guy it wouldn't be a big jump to murder.	Y
407	00:25:29	00:25:30	What is this?	N
408	00:25:32	00:25:34	Your first stop the AvCon gas station.	Y
409	00:25:34	00:25:35	See these two guys?	N
410	00:25:35	00:25:37	Nope.	N
411	00:25:37	00:25:40	Don't know what you're talking about.	N
412	00:25:40	00:25:42	My little brother got me this job.	Y
413	00:25:42	00:25:43	I'm staying clean.	Y
414	00:25:43	00:25:46	Suppose I told you your brother said you did these guys.	Y
415	00:25:49	00:25:51	He wouldn't do that.	N
416	00:25:51	00:26:00	You did it directly after work using a .380 pistol and then you strangled one of the victims with his own tie.	Y
417	00:26:12	00:26:14	Ben did it.	N
418	00:26:15	00:26:16	Did you witness this?	Y
419	00:26:16	00:26:19	He told me about it.	Y
420	00:26:19	00:26:21	Look what I did-- I just lost my head.	N
421	00:26:22	00:26:23	What am I supposed to do now?	N
422	00:26:23	00:26:26	I'm on a short line, all right?	Y
423	00:26:26	00:26:27	You're on your own, Ben.	N
424	00:26:28	00:26:29	Roger, you've got to help me.	Y
425	00:26:29	00:26:30	You know I can't.	Y
426	00:26:30	00:26:31	What am I going to do?	Y
427	00:26:31	00:26:32	Huh?	N
428	00:26:32	00:26:33	It's your mess.	N
429	00:26:33	00:26:34	You got to deal with it.	N
430	00:26:34	00:26:37	What started the beef with the victims?	N
431	00:26:37	00:26:38	I don't know.	Y
432	00:26:38	00:26:40	Tempers, I guess.	Y
433	00:26:42	00:26:43	Hey!	N
434	00:26:43	00:26:45	Hey, man! I was here first.	N
435	00:26:45	00:26:46	You want to wait your turn?	N
436	00:26:46	00:26:48	What are you going to do, huh?	N
437	00:26:51	00:26:53	Bystander gets a little too nosy...	N
438	00:26:57	00:26:59	and he gets it, too.	N
439	00:27:01	00:27:04	The perpetrator's hands left flour on the victim's face.	N
440	00:27:04	00:27:06	This was not from a gunshot.	N
441	00:27:06	00:27:09	This was something a little more intimate.	N
442	00:27:20	00:27:30	When a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one of two reasons-- entertainment... or necessity.	N
443	00:27:30	00:27:32	Which was it for you?	Y
444	00:27:32	00:27:33	Neither.	N
445	00:27:33	00:27:36	I told you, Ben strangled that guy.	Y
446	00:27:36	00:27:38	The flour said you did.	Y
447	00:27:40	00:27:42	I don't know what you're talking about.	Y
448	00:27:43	00:27:46	Anything on the list besides the tie?	N
449	00:27:46	00:27:48	Nope.	N
450	00:27:50	00:27:52	Hey, guys.	N
451	00:27:52	00:27:53	You can go ahead and take off.	N
452	00:27:53	00:27:54	I think we got it.	N
453	00:27:54	00:27:55	Thanks.	N
454	00:28:02	00:28:03	Whoa.	N
455	00:28:18	00:28:19	Hey.	N
456	00:28:19	00:28:21	Dry cleaning.	N
457	00:28:21	00:28:22	The trailer's low-rent.	N
458	00:28:22	00:28:24	Dry cleaning's expensive.	N
459	00:28:36	00:28:38	Sara?	N
460	00:28:38	00:28:40	This man's not as smart as he thinks.	Y
461	00:28:40	00:28:42	Dry cleaning bakes in blood stains.	N
462	00:28:44	00:28:45	Could be red sauce.	N
463	00:28:45	00:28:46	Oh, now you're cautious.	N
464	00:28:46	00:28:49	I'm just trying to put our mistake to good use.	N
465	00:28:49	00:28:52	Okay. You wanna...	N
466	00:28:52	00:28:56	check the perimeter and I'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce.	N
467	00:28:56	00:28:57	Okay.	N
468	00:30:10	00:30:11	Hemoglobin.	N
469	00:30:11	00:30:13	Take a look at this.	N
470	00:30:19	00:30:20	Nick?	N
471	00:30:22	00:30:24	Hey, Nick.	N
472	00:31:07	00:31:09	jammed, huh?	N
473	00:31:09	00:31:11	Get anything instructive?	N
474	00:31:11	00:31:12	Possibly.	N
475	00:31:13	00:31:14	Blood from Jennings's denim shirt.	Y
476	00:31:19	00:31:20	Is the printer out of ink?	N
477	00:31:20	00:31:22	ND, ND, ND.	N
478	00:31:22	00:31:23	It means None Detected.	N
479	00:31:23	00:31:28	The dry cleaning baked in the blood and it also degraded it to a degree that I can't get a result.	N
480	00:31:28	00:31:31	Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.	N
481	00:31:31	00:31:32	I have tried.	N
482	00:31:32	00:31:33	It's chemically impossible, Sara.	N
483	00:31:33	00:31:35	Nothing from nothing is nothing.	N
484	00:31:42	00:31:45	The striations are different. See?	N
485	00:31:47	00:31:52	There's no way I can say that the bullets taken from the victims were fired by Jennings's gun.	Y
486	00:31:54	00:31:56	So, he altered the barrel somehow.	Y
487	00:31:56	00:32:03	Yeah. Changed how the bullet relates to the barrel so when the bullet emerges, its fine stria are altered.	N
488	00:32:03	00:32:05	Any idea what he used?	Y
489	00:32:07	00:32:09	Whatever it was...	N
490	00:32:09	00:32:10	did the job.	N
491	00:32:10	00:32:11	My evidence is no better.	N
492	00:32:11	00:32:13	Total wash.	N
493	00:32:16	00:32:18	We present this to the D.A.	N
494	00:32:18	00:32:22	Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before.	N
495	00:32:22	00:32:23	The guilty brother's going to walk.	Y
496	00:32:56	00:32:59	He's never been in any real trouble before.	Y
497	00:33:00	00:33:01	They'll go easy on him.	Y
498	00:33:06	00:33:08	The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?	N
499	00:33:18	00:33:21	So, it was necessity.	N
500	00:33:33	00:33:36	Wait, are you saying Shelley didn't die in the sauna?	N
501	00:33:36	00:33:37	She died of heat stroke.	N
502	00:33:37	00:33:41	But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.	N
503	00:33:41	00:33:42	Like what?	N
504	00:33:42	00:33:43	Shell was always healthy.	N
505	00:33:44	00:33:45	She went into anaphylactic shock.	N
506	00:33:45	00:33:52	Coroner says some of the indicators renal failure, cerebral edema.	N
507	00:33:52	00:33:57	We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.	Y
508	00:33:57	00:33:59	I don't understand.	Y
509	00:33:59	00:34:03	Well, maybe this will help-- the travel agency contract you and Shelley signed.	Y
510	00:34:03	00:34:07	Under allergic reactions to foods for Shelley Danvers-- shellfish.	N
511	00:34:07	00:34:09	As her best friend, you would know that.	Y
512	00:34:09	00:34:24	And then we have this from the hotel computer for your room 01 p.m., on the day A Taste from the Sea a lovely tureen of mild bisque with pureed bits of Maine lobster.	Y
513	00:34:24	00:34:27	Pureed, two bowls.	N
514	00:34:27	00:34:31	She didn't know what she was eating when it arrived, did she?	N
515	00:34:33	00:34:36	Because she didn't order it; you did.	Y
516	00:34:39	00:34:46	We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints.	N
517	00:34:46	00:34:48	Well, the machine isolated this.	N
518	00:34:49	00:34:51	00.	N
519	00:34:51	00:34:53	Shelley made that date.	N
520	00:34:53	00:34:54	That's her handwriting.	N
521	00:34:55	00:34:58	Were you in the room when Jeremy called?	Y
522	00:34:58	00:35:00	I answered the phone.	Y
523	00:35:00	00:35:02	He asked for her.	N
524	00:35:02	00:35:05	You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?	Y
525	00:35:05	00:35:07	I didn't mean to kill her.	Y
526	00:35:07	00:35:14	I thought that she would just have an allergic reaction and she wouldn't be able to make her date that night like, get hives or something.	Y
527	00:35:14	00:35:25	Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions-- trachea... larynx... tongue swelled.	N
528	00:35:25	00:35:30	Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs.	N
529	00:35:30	00:35:32	They shut down.	N
530	00:35:37	00:35:39	I didn't even like the guy.	Y
531	00:35:39	00:35:44	I just... I didn't want to be left out.	Y
532	00:35:48	00:35:52	Miss Kolas, you're under arrest.	Y
533	00:35:52	00:35:55	Hey.	N
534	00:35:55	00:35:56	D.A.'s looking for you.	N
535	00:35:56	00:35:59	About? What, you think I read your messages?	N
536	00:36:00	00:36:03	Top secret and urgent?	N
537	00:36:03	00:36:04	It's a gift, reading upside down.	N
538	00:36:04	00:36:06	The Las Vegas District Attorney is reportedly...	N
539	00:36:06	00:36:08	preparing to file homicide charges...	N
540	00:36:08	00:36:13	against Benjamin Corey Jennings in the so-called Burial Murders case.	N
541	00:36:13	00:36:16	Jennings has been in police custody for the last...	N
542	00:36:16	00:36:18	Guess we know what she was calling about.	N
543	00:36:18	00:36:23	...since he was caught burying the first victim, Oliver Dunne in the National Forest.	N
544	00:36:23	00:36:28	Don't you have enough cases over at CSI now you're going to start telling me which ones I should take to court?	N
545	00:36:28	00:36:32	There isn't one piece of evidence that says that kid was even present at the murders.	N
546	00:36:32	00:36:34	As a matter of fact this is why I was hunting you.	N
547	00:36:34	00:36:37	Jennings brought it in about an hour ago.	Y
548	00:36:37	00:36:39	Chain of custody; I can't touch it.	N
549	00:36:40	00:36:42	The first victim was ligatured, right?	N
550	00:36:51	00:36:54	Jennings says his little brother asked him to hide the tie.	Y
551	00:36:54	00:36:55	Well, how convenient.	N
552	00:36:55	00:37:01	The older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over the murder weapon.	Y
553	00:37:01	00:37:04	A jury doesn't understand epi-whatevers, okay?	N
554	00:37:04	00:37:09	They understand a twisty tie and blood all over Ben's car seat.	N
555	00:37:09	00:37:10	He set up his brother.	Y
556	00:37:10	00:37:14	Oh, come on, Grissom, they're both part of it and if I can get one of them, I will.	N
557	00:37:14	00:37:15	He's a good kid, Robin.	N
558	00:37:15	00:37:18	He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid.	Y
559	00:37:18	00:37:19	Yeah?	N
560	00:37:19	00:37:22	Then his epithelials shouldn't be on that tie.	N
561	00:37:24	00:37:31	Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim.	N
562	00:37:31	00:37:32	I don't know.	N
563	00:37:32	00:37:36	Your brother brought this in to the District Attorney.	Y
564	00:37:40	00:37:42	What?	N
565	00:37:42	00:37:43	He's framing you.	Y
566	00:37:43	00:37:49	Unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie.	N
567	00:37:49	00:37:52	I don't know.	N
568	00:37:52	00:37:54	I swear I don't know.	N
569	00:37:54	00:37:57	I... he... I just picked up the bodies at his place.	Y
570	00:37:59	00:38:00	Grab that guy's tie, little bro.	N
571	00:38:00	00:38:02	I like that thing.	Y
572	00:38:08	00:38:10	Bury them deep, all right?	N
573	00:38:10	00:38:14	You get into any trouble you don't have to say anything, all right?	N
574	00:38:14	00:38:15	I'm counting on you.	Y
575	00:38:15	00:38:18	Yeah, yeah, man, I'm there all the way.	N
576	00:38:18	00:38:21	Go, get out of here.	N
577	00:38:21	00:38:23	Go on.	N
578	00:38:24	00:38:26	I got to ask...	N
579	00:38:26	00:38:30	how does somebody bury two bodies as a favor?	N
580	580	00:38:30	00:38:32	'Cause he's my brother.	N
581	00:38:33	00:38:37	He told... He told me that if I didn't talk...	Y
582	00:38:37	00:38:41	to you guys and if he didn't talk, then this would all just blow over; it'd all just go away.	Y
583	00:38:41	00:38:45	You're looking at two counts of Murder Special Circumstances.	N
584	00:38:45	00:38:50	The best you can hope for is life without parole.	N
585	00:38:50	00:38:53	I don't... I don't think I can do that kind of time.	N
586	00:38:55	00:39:00	Do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders?	Y
587	00:39:00	00:39:01	Anything?	N
588	00:39:57	00:40:00	I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.	N
589	00:40:07	00:40:09	He came to see you as soon as Ben was in custody.	Y
590	00:40:12	00:40:16	I tried to help without breaking my vows.	N
591	00:40:20	00:40:24	We both have jobs that begin after the crime.	N
592	00:40:24	00:40:27	After the sin.	N
593	00:40:27	00:40:31	Some people would call that a career in futility.	N
594	00:40:31	00:40:34	Some call it a vocation.	N
595	00:40:37	00:40:42	100 years ago we didn't have the technology for fingerprints.	N
596	00:40:42	00:40:44	15 years ago, we didn't have DNA.	N
597	00:40:44	00:40:52	Hopefully one day, we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail in this case.	N
598	00:40:52	00:40:55	Someday, we won't need jails.	N
599	00:40:58	00:41:02	00.	N
600	00:41:04	00:41:07	Thank you...	N
601	00:41:07	00:41:10	but...	N
602	00:41:10	00:41:12	no.	N
603	00:41:12	00:41:15	You don't believe?	N
604	00:41:15	00:41:18	In religion?	N
605	00:41:18	00:41:21	I believe in God, in science...	N
606	00:41:21	00:41:23	in Sunday supper.	N
607	00:41:23	00:41:27	I don't believe in rules that tell me how I should live.	N
608	00:41:27	00:41:30	Even if they're handed down by God?	N
609	00:41:30	00:41:32	How many crusades were fought in the name of God?	N
610	00:41:32	00:41:36	How many people died because of someone's religion?	N
611	00:41:36	00:41:39	Fanaticism; not religion.	N
612	00:41:39	00:41:41	Semantics.	N
613	00:41:41	00:41:43	They're still dead.	N
614	00:41:44	00:41:47	I'm sorry about Ben, Father.	N
615	00:41:50	00:41:53	You still suffer like a Catholic.	N
616	00:41:56	00:42:00	Light bulb goes out other people fix it, get a new one.	N
617	00:42:00	00:42:08	Light bulb goes out for the Catholic he stands in the dark says, What did I do wrong?	N
618	00:42:10	00:42:12	That guilt's not in me anymore.	N
619	00:42:28	00:42:29	Hey.	N
620	00:42:29	00:42:30	Oh.	N
621	00:42:31	00:42:35	You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.	N
622	00:42:35	00:42:38	Spa safety?	N
623	00:42:38	00:42:42	We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean.	N
624	00:42:42	00:42:46	Some foul play; some negligence.	N
625	00:42:46	00:42:48	So what am I supposed to say?	N
626	00:42:48	00:42:50	That it was an isolated incident...	N
627	00:42:50	00:42:55	that in no way should it be a mark against the Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.	N
628	00:42:55	00:42:58	CSI supports Las Vegas.	N
629	00:42:58	00:42:59	Bottom line.	N
630	00:43:07	00:43:09	Need some help in here!	N
631	00:43:15	00:43:16	Hold his head! Hold his head!	N
632	00:43:16	00:43:18	I can't stop the bleeding.	N
633	00:43:18	00:43:20	Oh, no, no, no.	N
634	00:43:20	00:43:21	How did this happen?!	N
635	00:43:21	00:43:23	Incisor. He used his teeth.	N
636	00:43:23	00:43:24	Clamp down.	N
637	00:43:26	00:43:27	Keep him with us.	N
638	00:43:27	00:43:28	Get out of the way!	N
639	00:43:28	00:43:30	Out of the way! Sir, step back.	N
640	00:43:30	00:43:32	Sir. He's bleeding out.	N
641	00:43:32	00:43:33	He's bleeding out here.	N
642	00:43:33	00:43:35	We need to stop this.	N
643	00:43:35	00:43:37	Compression. Keep him with us.	N
644	00:43:37	00:43:38	Get the head up.	N
645	00:43:38	00:43:41	We're losing him, we're losing him.	N
646	00:43:46	00:43:49	04.	N
