2	00:00:23	00:00:24	Say it loud and say it proud!	N
3	00:00:24	00:00:26	Omega Zeta Pi!	N
4	00:00:33	00:00:33	Dude...	N
5	00:00:34	00:00:36	what's crawling on my face?	N
6	00:00:36	00:00:39	It's Fraternity Hell Week.	N
7	00:00:39	00:00:42	A pledge slipped and fell in this pile of maggots.	N
8	00:00:42	00:00:48	School of Agriculture is in charge of campus landscaping, so Security called me.	N
9	00:00:48	00:00:50	You were the first person I thought of.	N
10	00:00:50	00:00:52	Well, thank you, Eva. I'm honored.	N
11	00:00:52	00:00:54	You make your own mulch?	N
12	00:00:54	00:00:56	The university is self-sustaining.	N
13	00:00:56	00:00:58	A city within a city.	N
14	00:00:58	00:01:01	State institutions are encouraged to practice Xeriscaping.	N
15	00:01:02	00:01:03	Xeri meaning dry?	N
16	00:01:03	00:01:06	Landscaping using drought-tolerant plant life.	N
17	00:01:06	00:01:07	Conserves water.	N
18	00:01:07	00:01:10	There's no reason for these maggots to be here.	N
19	00:01:10	00:01:13	Dr. Grissom, your tea. Hold the tea bag?	N
20	00:01:13	00:01:15	Thank you, Brian.	N
21	00:01:20	00:01:21	Do, uh...	N
22	00:01:21	00:01:25	do you use scraps from the dining halls for your compost?	N
23	00:01:25	00:01:26	No. Why?	N
24	00:01:27	00:01:35	Well, if the devil requires a pound of flesh, this many maggots would require over a hundred.	N
25	00:01:35	00:01:37	Pounds of flesh?	N
26	00:01:54	00:01:58	Were you aware that the average college student weighs 135 pounds?	N
27	00:02:37	00:02:39	How long is this going to take?	N
28	00:02:39	00:02:41	If something happened to one of our students, don't you want to know?	N
29	00:02:41	00:02:42	Sure.	N
30	00:02:43	00:02:49	But on a campus this size, there's a thin line between satisfying curiosity and creating panic.	N
31	00:02:49	00:02:53	This stopped being about my curiosity the minute we found a human tooth.	N
32	00:02:54	00:02:58	We're now investigating a possible homicide.	N
33	00:03:01	00:03:04	Hey, Grissom, why is it hot?	N
34	00:03:04	00:03:07	Maggot digestion can generate heat up to 125 degrees.	N
35	00:03:07	00:03:13	Heat increases the rate of putrefaction, which speeds up the digestive process.	N
36	00:03:14	00:03:15	I don't see any tissue.	N
37	00:03:15	00:03:18	How long would it take for them to pick a body clean?	N
38	00:03:18	00:03:20	Assuming it's just one body?	N
39	00:03:20	00:03:21	A few days.	N
40	00:03:21	00:03:22	Yeah, and that's another thing.	N
41	00:03:22	00:03:26	I have a hard time believing that if a corpse was here, no one saw it.	N
42	00:03:26	00:03:27	And these bones?	N
43	00:03:27	00:03:30	They're uniform.	N
44	00:03:30	00:03:32	Same shape and size.	N
45	00:03:32	00:03:35	Yeah.	N
46	00:03:37	00:03:39	Same size as these wood chips.	N
47	00:04:05	00:04:06	This thing always this loud?	N
48	00:04:07	00:04:09	Yeah, but we're, we're kind of off the beaten path.	N
49	00:04:10	00:04:11	You use it every day?	N
50	00:04:11	00:04:13	Pretty much.	N
51	00:04:17	00:04:19	You think a human body could fit through there?	N
52	00:04:20	00:04:21	You planning something?	N
53	00:04:21	00:04:23	Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
54	00:04:23	00:04:25	Walter Beerly, Master of the Universe.	N
55	00:04:25	00:04:27	Six cylinders.	N
56	00:04:27	00:04:29	200 horse power.	N
57	00:04:29	00:04:33	Thing's got an engine that would give most SUVs a run for their money.	N
58	00:04:33	00:04:34	And it's got one job.	N
59	00:04:34	00:04:36	Chopping crap up.	N
60	00:04:37	00:04:38	So the answer's yes.	N
61	00:04:42	00:04:44	Would take about 15 seconds.	N
62	00:04:44	00:04:45	May I?	N
63	00:04:45	00:04:47	You want to stick your head in there, be my guest.	N
64	00:04:51	00:04:52	What are you looking for?	N
65	00:04:52	00:04:54	Blood.	N
66	00:04:54	00:05:02	Oh, you're pretty much out of luck, 'cause I've been chipping all morning, and if there was any in there, it's probably gone.	N
67	00:05:02	00:05:05	See, wood absorbs moisture.	N
68	00:05:05	00:05:08	One of the reasons they use it for mulch.	N
69	00:05:17	00:05:18	Pregnant?	N
70	00:05:20	00:05:21	It's human.	N
71	00:05:34	00:05:36	Remember, you're on the clock, man.	N
72	00:05:36	00:05:42	About, uh, 24 hours... all of these maggots turn into flies.	N
73	00:06:05	00:06:07	What are you doing?	N
74	00:06:07	00:06:11	Day shift told me you didn't get any results off the tooth.	N
75	00:06:11	00:06:14	Yeah, it was a porcelain crown.	N
76	00:06:14	00:06:16	Root canal. No viable pulp.	N
77	00:06:16	00:06:18	I still need a DNA profile on our victim.	N
78	00:06:18	00:06:21	And since bone marrow extraction can be difficult...	N
79	00:06:21	00:06:24	I figured I'd go straight to the source.	N
80	00:06:24	00:06:27	Well, maggots are eating machines.	N
81	00:06:27	00:06:30	They'll have DNA from the flesh.	N
82	00:06:30	00:06:32	It's genius.	N
83	00:06:32	00:06:33	There you go.	N
84	00:06:33	00:06:36	One maggot colada, coming up.	N
85	00:06:46	00:06:48	What's with the tape?	N
86	00:06:48	00:06:51	The evidence wasn't cooperating, so I stuck it to them.	N
87	00:06:52	00:06:53	Cute.	N
88	00:06:55	00:06:57	Anything of interest?	N
89	00:06:57	00:06:59	Well, I haven't had much time for analysis.	N
90	00:06:59	00:07:06	So far the only inorganics are these black plastic shreds, from a garbage bag, I think, and...	N
91	00:07:06	00:07:07	this.	N
92	00:07:16	00:07:19	Well, blue trace is tacky.	N
93	00:07:22	00:07:25	It's a fingernail.	N
94	00:07:26	00:07:27	Uh, sorry, Sara.	N
95	00:07:27	00:07:28	I need the microscope. Priority.	N
96	00:07:28	00:07:30	I got three more samples to run.	N
97	00:07:30	00:07:31	When I'm done, it'll be your turn.	N
98	00:07:31	00:07:32	This can't wait.	N
99	00:07:32	00:07:33	It can't?	N
100	00:07:34	00:07:35	Or you can't?	N
101	00:07:35	00:07:36	Both.	N
102	00:07:36	00:07:38	Go have a cup of coffee on me.	N
103	00:07:42	00:07:43	The coffee's free.	N
104	00:07:43	00:07:45	Thank you.	N
105	00:08:21	00:08:25	Oil-based blue paint mixed with motor oil...	N
106	00:08:25	00:08:26	on a fingernail.	N
107	00:08:28	00:08:31	He's back.	N
108	00:08:31	00:08:35	Starting in 1987, a series of murders occurred on the WLVU campus.	N
109	00:08:36	00:08:38	Janet Kent...	N
110	00:08:38	00:08:40	Marcia Reese...	N
111	00:08:40	00:08:41	and Charlene Roth.	N
112	00:08:42	00:08:47	Now, Charlene Roth's murder provided us with enough evidence to investigate a suspect...	N
113	00:08:48	00:08:51	John Mathers, WLVU security guard.	N
114	00:08:51	00:08:54	He was arrested, tried and convicted.	N
115	00:08:54	00:08:57	Two years ago, this week, he was executed.	N
116	00:08:57	00:09:00	The night of his execution, Debby Reston was murdered.	N
117	00:09:00	00:09:01	Copycat, right?	N
118	00:09:01	00:09:02	No.	N
119	00:09:02	00:09:07	We believe that Mathers was the copycat, responsible only for Charlene Roth's death.	N
120	00:09:07	00:09:09	Which means the serial killer is still at large.	N
121	00:09:09	00:09:11	And we have reason to believe that he has killed again.	N
122	00:09:12	00:09:14	Our suspect's M.O.	N
123	00:09:14	00:09:21	is to apply blue paint to a campus railing that he has infused with motor oil to retard the drying process.	N
124	00:09:21	00:09:26	He then lays in wait for a female victim to touch the railing.	N
125	00:09:26	00:09:28	It's always near a water fountain.	N
126	00:09:28	00:09:33	He then grabs them from behind as they're washing the paint from their hands.	N
127	00:09:33	00:09:36	Our suspect's prior victims were all sexually assaulted.	N
128	00:09:37	00:09:38	No semen was found.	N
129	00:09:38	00:09:40	strangulation.	N
130	00:09:40	00:09:46	He stuffed them in black plastic trash bags and dumps the bodies in plain sight.	N
131	00:09:46	00:09:53	Given that he has been killing for around 20 years, we approximate his age to be at least 35.	N
132	00:09:53	00:09:54	He may wear glasses.	N
133	00:09:54	00:09:56	He may drive a Chevy with black interior.	N
134	00:09:56	00:09:58	The latest victim was put in a wood chipper.	N
135	00:09:59	00:10:00	Why the change in M.O.?	N
136	00:10:00	00:10:04	Serials have been known to change their signatures because they have to.	N
137	00:10:04	00:10:06	Fear of being caught...	N
138	00:10:06	00:10:10	interruption... or it could just be an act of escalation.	N
139	00:10:10	00:10:14	So we're looking for a sadistic, ritualistic, organized sociopath.	N
140	00:10:15	00:10:16	We'll be on 12 and 12s.	N
141	00:10:16	00:10:19	No holidays, no vacations until this is solved.	N
142	00:10:23	00:10:26	Ms. Willows, can you confirm that the Blue Paint Killer has claimed another victim?	N
143	00:10:27	00:10:28	I haven't been cleared for comment.	N
144	00:10:28	00:10:31	Ms. Willows, was John Mathers wrongfully convicted?	N
145	00:10:31	00:10:34	Did the State execute an innocent man?	N
146	00:10:34	00:10:39	John Mathers killed Charlene Roth and was punished for it.	N
147	00:10:39	00:10:41	Well, how can you be so sure of that?	N
148	00:10:41	00:10:43	I double-checked the results.	N
149	00:10:43	00:10:44	The DNA from the maggots is male.	N
150	00:10:44	00:10:46	Any possible cross-contamination?	N
151	00:10:46	00:10:49	No, the samples were pure.	N
152	00:10:49	00:10:51	Griss, this place is crawling with press.	N
153	00:10:51	00:10:52	They want a statement.	N
154	00:10:52	00:10:55	Not now. Well, if you don't say anything, they're just going to fill in the blanks...	N
155	00:10:55	00:11:01	Screw the press, 'cause for all I know, the dead body is an auto mechanic who just painted his house blue.	N
156	00:11:19	00:11:22	What's this key used for?	N
157	00:11:22	00:11:25	Um, pledging. Plebes are asked to swallow it on the first night of Hell Week.	N
158	00:11:25	00:11:27	Then retrieve it and return it by the end of the week, right?	N
159	00:11:27	00:11:28	You got it.	N
160	00:11:29	00:11:30	You know that hazing is illegal.	N
161	00:11:30	00:11:31	You could lose your charter.	N
162	00:11:31	00:11:35	Well, it's not hazing. It's a voluntary loyalty ritual.	N
163	00:11:35	00:11:37	Political science major?	N
164	00:11:37	00:11:38	Pre-law. ! Good.	N
165	00:11:38	00:11:42	Maybe you can explain why the pledge who swallowed this key ended up dead.	N
166	00:11:42	00:11:45	Wha-What're you talking about?	N
167	00:11:45	00:11:49	Has anyone from Omega Zeta Pi dropped out or gone missing?	N
168	00:11:55	00:11:57	Uh...	N
169	00:12:00	00:12:03	Yeah, Jo-Jonathan Avery Haywood III.	N
170	00:12:03	00:12:06	Johnny. Oh, kid was a shoe-in.	N
171	00:12:06	00:12:07	Dad was a member. Granddad was a member.	N
172	00:12:07	00:12:10	But we haven't seen Johnny since Pledge Week.	N
173	00:12:10	00:12:14	So, he's been missing for days, yet you didn't bother to call anyone?	N
174	00:12:14	00:12:16	For all I knew he was getting laid.	N
175	00:12:16	00:12:19	Look, I'm the fraternity president, not his mother.	N
176	00:12:19	00:12:21	We're gonna need his toothbrush and his hairbrush.	N
177	00:12:21	00:12:23	Get off of me! Button!	N
178	00:12:23	00:12:25	I'm a loser. I'm a loser. I'm a loser.	N
179	00:12:32	00:12:35	Why didn't Nick find this before?	N
180	180	180	00:12:35	00:12:39	'Cause he was working from a schematic the campus security gave him.	N
181	00:12:39	00:12:41	The railing's not on it.	N
182	00:12:52	00:12:54	This cement is fresh.	N
183	00:12:57	00:13:01	So, now he's not just painting railings; he's installing them.	N
184	00:13:01	00:13:05	We're going to need to dig this up, cement and all.	N
185	00:13:19	00:13:22	Get Brass. We have another body.	N
186	00:13:47	00:13:51	So, he knew we would find this.	N
187	00:13:52	00:13:55	And now he's taunting us.	N
188	00:15:17	00:15:25	Two years ago, DNA confirmed a hair found on Debby Reston belonged to the serial's first victim, Janet Kent.	N
189	00:15:27	00:15:29	Planted hairs.	N
190	00:15:29	00:15:32	It's part of his signature.	N
191	00:16:03	00:16:08	Well, DNA confirmed that the hair found in the doll's mouth belonged to Debby Reston.	N
192	00:16:08	00:16:13	I tested the note with ESDA, because I saw some indentations in the paper.	N
193	00:16:13	00:16:17	He must've written I have her on the underlying page.	Y
194	00:16:17	00:16:23	Prior evidence indicated that the suspect was an artist or had some connection to the university's Art Department.	N
195	00:16:23	00:16:26	Serials typically photograph their crime scenes.	N
196	00:16:26	00:16:27	If we're dealing with an artist here...	N
197	00:16:28	00:16:30	maybe he drew his victims instead.	Y
198	00:16:30	00:16:32	Looks like she's in a small room.	N
199	00:16:32	00:16:34	What is that in the foreground?	N
200	00:16:34	00:16:36	Chair? Sofa?	N
201	00:16:36	00:16:38	What about behind her?	N
202	00:16:38	00:16:39	Windows, maybe.	N
203	00:16:40	00:16:41	Can we blow that up?	N
204	00:16:45	00:16:47	Some kind of signage?	N
205	00:16:47	00:16:50	And the lettering's backwards.	N
206	00:16:50	00:16:52	Cramped space.	N
207	00:16:52	00:16:54	Chairs in the foreground, but no other furniture.	N
208	00:16:54	00:16:56	No shutters or curtains on the windows.	N
209	00:16:59	00:17:02	Maybe it's not a room. Maybe it's a... vehicle.	N
210	00:17:02	00:17:06	He was in the front seat, and he was looking at her through the rearview mirror.	Y
211	00:17:12	00:17:21	So, he can attack her, abduct her, rape her and strangle her, but he can't look directly at her?	Y
212	00:17:21	00:17:27	Guys, those black trilobal fibers that we found on Debby Reston's body were from a Chevy.	N
213	00:17:27	00:17:34	And the size and shape of those windows are consistent with a Chevy van.	N
214	00:17:42	00:17:44	I recognize the signage.	N
215	00:17:44	00:17:47	The Erotica Boutique on Tropicana.	N
216	00:17:50	00:17:53	It's distinctive...	N
217	00:17:53	00:17:55	The font...	N
218	00:18:10	00:18:12	Okay, break it open.	N
219	00:18:31	00:18:33	So, this is where he brought them.	Y
220	00:18:38	00:18:41	The pump was probably for the doll.	N
221	00:18:41	00:18:43	Beer bottles...	N
222	00:18:43	00:18:48	Tell Mia to check them for saliva, as well as other bodily fluids.	N
223	00:18:48	00:18:52	You're thinking she was raped with a foreign object...	N
224	00:18:52	00:18:54	may be why we never found semen.	N
225	00:18:55	00:18:58	The police presence on the campus probably interrupted his plans for her disposal.	Y
226	00:18:58	00:19:00	I'll take the girl.	N
227	00:19:00	00:19:01	I'll take the van.	N
228	00:19:29	00:19:30	Huh.	N
229	00:19:30	00:19:32	I would've picked you for a leather guy.	N
230	00:19:34	00:19:40	Has anyone, uh, bought one of these Coed Cheerleader Dolls in the last few days?	N
231	00:19:40	00:19:44	Most popular models are the latex love-'em-or-leave-'em cheapies for bachelor parties.	N
232	00:19:44	00:19:47	But in the midrange, Chrissy's not a bad choice.	N
233	00:19:47	00:19:52	Well, I'm more interested in the clientele than the merchandise.	N
234	00:19:52	00:19:53	Oh.	N
235	00:19:54	00:19:56	I'd like to take a look at your credit card receipts.	N
236	00:20:00	00:20:03	Surveillance?	N
237	00:20:03	00:20:04	Bad for business.	N
238	00:20:21	00:20:23	You know this artist?	N
239	00:20:23	00:20:26	Yeah, that is Zippy Tee.	N
240	00:20:26	00:20:27	You have an address for him?	N
241	00:20:27	00:20:28	Dude, I don't know where he lives.	N
242	00:20:28	00:20:29	How do you pay him?	N
243	00:20:29	00:20:31	It's not the Louvre.	N
244	00:20:31	00:20:33	It's the Love Boutique.	N
245	00:20:33	00:20:35	Local guys get store credit.	N
246	00:20:35	00:20:38	Has he ever traded for... a doll?	N
247	00:20:38	00:20:40	Yeah.	N
248	00:20:40	00:20:42	Can you describe him for me?	N
249	00:20:42	00:20:44	White guy. Brown hair.	N
250	00:20:44	00:20:48	Little shorter than you. 40, maybe 45...	N
251	00:20:48	00:20:50	Average looking. Average looking.	N
252	00:20:54	00:20:57	This all looks eerily familiar.	N
253	00:20:57	00:20:59	Blue paint on the hand.	N
254	00:20:59	00:21:02	Physical signs of sexual assault.	N
255	00:21:02	00:21:05	Ligature marks around the neck.	N
256	00:21:05	00:21:08	Prints turn up anything?	N
257	00:21:08	00:21:09	She's still a Jane Doe.	N
258	00:21:09	00:21:10	Height and weight?	N
259	00:21:10	00:21:11	Five-eight.	N
260	00:21:12	00:21:13	131 pounds.	N
261	00:21:13	00:21:15	Can you take down her hair?	N
262	00:21:15	00:21:16	Sure.	N
263	00:21:21	00:21:23	Pretty.	N
264	00:21:39	00:21:41	Pretty boy.	N
265	00:21:42	00:21:44	Definite similarity.	N
266	00:21:44	00:21:45	None of the other victims looked alike.	N
267	00:21:45	00:21:47	So, why these two?	N
268	00:21:47	00:21:48	Maybe he was a mistake.	N
269	00:21:48	00:21:50	Mistaken for a girl?	N
270	00:21:50	00:21:54	But not just any girl.	N
271	00:21:54	00:21:56	This girl.	N
272	00:21:59	00:22:02	We thought he selected his victims at random.	Y
273	00:22:03	00:22:04	He didn't.	Y
274	00:22:04	00:22:07	He chose her.	Y
275	00:22:07	00:22:08	He hunted her.	Y
276	00:22:08	00:22:10	And trapped her.	N
277	00:22:12	00:22:15	The TV said you were looking for information on Kaitlin Rackish.	N
278	00:22:15	00:22:18	When was the last time you saw Kaitlin?	N
279	00:22:18	00:22:25	Monday, but I've been pledging, so I haven't slept in the dorm the last couple nights.	N
280	00:22:25	00:22:30	I just thought I kept missing her.	N
281	00:22:30	00:22:32	Can you tell me what the two of you did on Monday?	N
282	00:22:32	00:22:33	All the details.	N
283	00:22:34	00:22:40	We went to the gym. Showered.	N
284	00:22:40	00:22:42	Went to the dining hall.	N
285	00:22:42	00:22:44	Monday's mac-n-cheese day.	N
286	00:22:44	00:22:46	It's Katy's favorite.	N
287	00:22:46	00:22:53	We picked up our orders at the Campus Copy Union-- term papers.	N
288	00:22:53	00:22:58	We bought sodas at the bookstore.	N
289	00:22:58	00:23:02	We went to the library to study.	N
290	00:23:02	00:23:10	A couple guys from Zeta Beta Theta were at the same table, so we didn't get that much done.	N
291	00:23:10	00:23:13	00 class.	N
292	00:23:13	00:23:15	What class is that?	N
293	00:23:18	00:23:20	Monday's, um...	N
294	00:23:20	00:23:24	Introduction to the Female Form with Professor Lewis.	N
295	00:23:24	00:23:28	Cody Lewis?	N
296	00:23:28	00:23:32	He got me interested in art.	N
297	00:23:32	00:23:35	Introduction to the Female Form?	N
298	00:23:35	00:23:40	Well, that's deep. That's really deep.	N
299	00:23:40	00:23:43	I bet that brings in all the 17-year-old pre-feminists.	N
300	00:23:43	00:23:45	This isn't mine.	N
301	00:23:45	00:23:47	Technique isn't bad, but it's raw.	N
302	00:23:47	00:23:49	This person hasn't had any formal training at all.	Y
303	00:23:49	00:23:51	Well, maybe it's your alter ego.	N
304	00:23:51	00:23:53	You know, your bad-boy side; the Mr. Hyde thing.	N
305	00:23:53	00:23:56	You know, I came in voluntarily. You see, I want to help you.	N
306	00:23:56	00:23:58	But this is borderlining on harassment.	N
307	00:23:58	00:24:02	Look, I'm trying to tie together some loose ends, so help me out, all right? I appreciate your help. I do.	N
308	00:24:02	00:24:04	You got rid of your Chevy van.	N
309	00:24:04	00:24:05	You got yourself a wife.	N
310	00:24:05	00:24:07	Does she know you dated the first victim?	N
311	00:24:07	00:24:11	Your return to the campus coincided with the murder of the fourth victim?	N
312	00:24:11	00:24:14	And Kaitlin Rackish was in your evening classes?	N
313	00:24:14	00:24:15	You see what I got?	N
314	00:24:15	00:24:16	No, I don't.	N
315	00:24:16	00:24:19	Your buddy Mathers didn't talk much, either, and look what happened to him.	N
316	00:24:19	00:24:21	He's at the wrong end of a cold needle.	N
317	00:24:21	00:24:26	You know what it's like to be told you lead the life and fit the profile of a serial killer?	N
318	00:24:26	00:24:27	No. I wouldn't have a clue.	N
319	00:24:27	00:24:31	You see, you make all these assumptions, and you're not asking questions here.	N
320	00:24:31	00:24:34	You're attacking me to see how I react to what you say.	N
321	00:24:34	00:24:36	Nothing I say is going to make a difference with you.	N
322	00:24:36	00:24:37	So what's the point?	N
323	00:24:37	00:24:40	Why don't you just confess?	N
324	00:24:42	00:24:44	That's my point.	N
325	00:24:44	00:24:47	I didn't do it.	N
326	00:24:55	00:24:57	WLVU parking pass.	N
327	00:24:57	00:25:01	Connection to the campus. 1986.	N
328	00:25:02	00:25:03	This guy's been doing this a long time.	Y
329	00:25:03	00:25:07	Two years ago, Debby Reston broke her killer's glasses.	Y
330	00:25:09	00:25:10	They were 20/80.	N
331	00:25:10	00:25:12	I'll run 'em. See if they're the same.	N
332	00:25:14	00:25:17	VIN's been obliterated.	N
333	00:25:17	00:25:19	You better go ahead and run that parking pass.	N
334	00:25:21	00:25:23	Plate's expired.	N
335	00:25:23	00:25:25	Registration sticker's a phoney.	N
336	00:25:25	00:25:26	How do you know?	N
337	00:25:26	00:25:29	Check out the serial number.	N
338	00:25:29	00:25:34	0-0-0-0... Yeah, got it. Homemade.	N
339	00:25:55	00:25:58	Hey, did you spill print powder in the back of the van? No.	N
340	00:25:58	00:26:00	No, I superglued. Why?	N
341	00:26:00	00:26:03	May have found something.	N
342	00:26:03	00:26:06	Anything from the prints off the van?	N
343	00:26:06	00:26:15	Prints from the dash and the rearview mirror were a match to the partial that we got off the trash bag Debby Reston was found in two years ago.	N
344	00:26:15	00:26:17	Same guy, but still no hits from AFIS.	N
345	00:26:20	00:26:22	Are the X-rated comic books ready?	N
346	00:26:22	00:26:25	Nothing comical about them. Look at this.	N
347	00:26:25	00:26:30	Double-D cups, tiny waists, bondage.	N
348	00:26:30	00:26:31	Dehumanization.	N
349	00:26:31	00:26:39	I'm all for visual stimulation, but these images are about domination, not sex.	N
350	00:26:39	00:26:43	This artist gets off on dominating women.	Y
351	00:26:43	00:26:45	This is his sex.	N
352	00:26:48	00:26:52	Janet and Marcia both lived in Dakin Hall.	N
353	00:26:52	00:26:55	Charlene and Debby took Econ 101.	N
354	00:26:55	00:26:59	Marcia and Charlene took English Lit.	N
355	00:26:59	00:27:04	Janet, Debby and Kaitlin all ate at Macgraw Dining Hall.	N
356	00:27:04	00:27:05	Janet dated Cody Lewis.	N
357	00:27:05	00:27:08	Kaitlin took his art class.	N
358	00:27:08	00:27:12	All right, so, uh, There's not one single thing that all five women have in common.	N
359	00:27:12	00:27:14	Right.	N
360	00:27:48	00:27:49	Please, help.	N
361	00:28:22	00:28:25	Dead plates.	N
362	00:28:25	00:28:28	Tampered VIN. Registration stickers are counterfeit.	N
363	00:28:28	00:28:29	Killer did a good job, though.	Y
364	00:28:30	00:28:33	He used the right color, changed them every year, but no serial numbers.	Y
365	00:28:33	00:28:35	So, we still don't know who owns the van.	N
366	00:28:35	00:28:38	Well, Greg did find this in the glove box.	N
367	00:28:38	00:28:39	It's from 1986.	N
368	00:28:39	00:28:41	So I called School Administration.	N
369	00:28:41	00:28:43	It's parking spot 324.	N
370	00:28:43	00:28:48	Not a student, but an employee executed two years ago.	N
371	00:28:48	00:28:49	John Mathers?	N
372	00:28:49	00:28:51	Yep. Ran Mathers through the DMV.	N
373	00:28:51	00:28:54	The partial VIN number on our van's a match.	N
374	00:28:54	00:28:57	So, our killer was driving around in Mathers' old van.	Y
375	00:28:57	00:29:01	I don't think these two guys are an original and a copycat.	Y
376	00:29:03	00:29:05	They were partners.	Y
377	00:29:09	00:29:11	I don't deserve to die.	N
378	00:29:13	00:29:15	You think killing me will solve anything?	N
379	00:29:15	00:29:20	I've prepared myself, but I'm not ready.	N
380	00:29:20	00:29:22	This the John Mathers interview?	N
381	00:29:22	00:29:23	Week before he was executed.	N
382	00:29:23	00:29:29	Charlene Roth's mother testified at the Allocution that your death would mean her closure.	N
383	00:29:29	00:29:30	Not if you kill the wrong man.	N
384	00:29:31	00:29:34	Forensic evidence testified to at your trial says that you're guilty.	N
385	00:29:34	00:29:35	Forensic evidence changes all the time.	N
386	00:29:35	00:29:37	One day I'm innocent, the next day I'm not.	N
387	00:29:37	00:29:39	Is there anything in his prison file?	N
388	00:29:39	00:29:43	All those years on death row he only had one visitor, his lawyer.	N
389	00:29:43	00:29:46	Although he did receive a far amount of letters from random women...	N
390	00:29:47	00:29:51	if he was in communication with his partner, nothing in the file shows it.	N
391	00:29:51	00:29:53	You've been in prison for 15 years.	N
392	00:29:53	00:29:56	During that time the murders stopped.	N
393	00:29:56	00:29:59	What does that prove?	N
394	00:30:00	00:30:01	The real killer's smart.	Y
395	00:30:01	00:30:04	Watches the news, he reads the papers just like you.	Y
396	00:30:05	00:30:08	I'm... Man, I'm the perfect patsy.	N
397	00:30:08	00:30:09	So you maintain your innocence?	N
398	00:30:09	00:30:10	Absolutely.	N
399	00:30:10	00:30:12	I worked Campus Security.	N
400	00:30:12	00:30:17	I'm not the smartest or the richest guy, but do I look like I had problems with women?	N
401	00:30:19	00:30:20	I'm not the killer.	N
402	00:30:23	00:30:26	Remember that when I'm gone.	N
403	00:30:27	00:30:36	Well, the prints on the comb bindings from the comic books are a match to the prints recovered from the van and the garbage bag that Debby Reston was in.	N
404	00:30:36	00:30:38	Did you analyze the comics?	N
405	00:30:38	00:30:42	Yeah, and the drawings indicate a dominant, disassociative sexual sadist.	N
406	00:30:42	00:30:47	Prison shrink diagnosed Mathers as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder.	N
407	00:30:47	00:30:51	Which means he was pre-disposed to violent crimes but he might have needed some encouragement.	N
408	00:30:51	00:30:56	Well, to invite someone to join you for torture and murder would require a great deal of trust.	N
409	00:30:56	00:31:00	You would only do it if you knew you could completely control your partner.	N
410	00:31:00	00:31:02	Mathers was the submissive.	N
411	00:31:02	00:31:05	His partner is the alpha male.	Y
412	00:31:05	00:31:08	Sexual sadism can go hand in hand with sexual dysfunction.	N
413	00:31:08	00:31:15	Mathers said that he wasn't the killer, but we confirmed that he had sex with Charlene Roth, based on the fact that we found his pubic hairs on her body.	N
414	00:31:15	00:31:21	Mia was looking for saliva on the beer bottles from the van and found a vaginal contribution on the neck of one of them.	N
415	00:31:21	00:31:24	Maybe Mathers was this guy's surrogate penis.	N
416	00:31:24	00:31:34	Okay, the partner kills on the eve of Mathers' execution, and again this week, on the second anniversary.	Y
417	00:31:34	00:31:36	Why the no-show last year?	N
418	00:31:36	00:31:38	Maybe life got in the way.	N
419	00:31:38	00:31:41	Nick, that black powder from the back of the van is ink.	N
420	00:31:41	00:31:44	A toner made exclusively for commercial copy machines.	N
421	00:31:44	00:31:45	OCE 3600.	N
422	00:31:46	00:31:47	Okay. Thanks, Hodges.	N
423	00:31:50	00:31:58	The most recent victim went to the Campus Copy Union with her roommate on the day she disappeared.	N
424	00:31:58	00:31:59	Janet Kent's...	N
425	00:32:03	00:32:08	pocket contents-- a receipt from WLVU Copy Union.	N
426	00:32:08	00:32:12	On Debby Reston's backseat...	N
427	00:32:14	00:32:16	catalogs with comb bindings.	N
428	00:32:19	00:32:20	Who'd you find?	N
429	00:32:21	00:32:23	Kevin Greer. Works at the Copy Union.	Y
430	00:32:23	00:32:26	Only employee who's been there over ten years; since 1983.	N
431	00:32:26	00:32:28	Fits our profile.	N
432	00:32:28	00:32:29	Where's Kevin Greer?	Y
433	00:32:29	00:32:30	00.	N
434	00:32:31	00:32:32	Time for evening classes to let out.	N
435	00:32:32	00:32:33	What's going on?	N
436	00:32:33	00:32:35	Look, we'd like to talk to Kevin Greer.	Y
437	00:32:35	00:32:36	You have any idea where he is?	Y
438	00:32:36	00:32:37	No. We don't hang out.	Y
439	00:32:37	00:32:38	How many people work here?	Y
440	00:32:38	00:32:39	Just me.	N
441	00:32:39	00:32:40	Okay, we need to look around.	N
442	00:32:41	00:32:42	Okay.	N
443	00:32:52	00:32:54	Black plastic trash bags with toner powder.	N
444	00:32:54	00:32:56	Excuse me.	N
445	00:32:56	00:32:59	Does Kevin Greer use this machine for any of his personal projects?	Y
446	00:32:59	00:33:01	Yeah. He binds his comic books.	Y
447	00:33:13	00:33:16	Kevin Greer, Las Vegas Police.	Y
448	00:33:16	00:33:17	Hit it.	N
449	00:33:28	00:33:29	Clear.	N
450	00:33:33	00:33:34	Check its noice.	N
451	00:33:34	00:33:36	Clear.	N
452	00:33:59	00:34:00	A paint mixer.	N
453	00:34:00	00:34:03	WLVU Blue.	N
454	00:34:03	00:34:08	So he mixed his own paint so we couldn't trace the origin of his purchase.	Y
455	00:34:12	00:34:14	Las Vegas's finest.	N
456	00:34:14	00:34:16	Nice job.	N
457	00:34:16	00:34:17	Impressive turnout.	N
458	00:34:17	00:34:19	Have a look around.	N
459	00:34:19	00:34:24	I'll be here at the station waiting for you.	Y
460	00:34:29	00:34:32	Gil, Jim.	N
461	00:34:37	00:34:40	If you made it to my house, you deserved to meet me.	Y
462	00:34:43	00:34:47	I mean, how much time did you guys spend picturing the size of my hands?	Y
463	00:34:50	00:34:53	Not very big.	N
464	00:34:53	00:34:56	You don't need big hands, though, not the way I do it.	Y
465	00:34:56	00:35:01	Just... just a little at a time.	N
466	00:35:04	00:35:07	Take life, give it back.	N
467	00:35:07	00:35:09	God-like.	N
468	00:35:09	00:35:11	God-like?	N
469	00:35:13	00:35:14	No.	N
470	00:35:17	00:35:29	But there must be something angelic in the way I look, because even on their last breath, they didn't think I'd actually do it.	Y
471	00:35:30	00:35:33	Am I disappointing you guys?	Y
472	00:35:33	00:35:37	I mean, are you looking at me, wishing I was...	Y
473	00:35:37	00:35:39	scarier?	N
474	00:35:39	00:35:42	No.	N
475	00:35:42	00:35:47	I was, uh, wondering what happened to your glasses.	Y
476	00:35:50	00:35:53	Stupid Lasik.	N
477	00:35:53	00:35:54	It's what got me caught.	Y
478	00:35:55	00:35:57	Is it?	N
479	00:35:57	00:35:59	When that Debby bitch busted my glasses...	Y
480	00:36:00	00:36:03	I decided they were a liability.	Y
481	00:36:05	00:36:07	But the procedure didn't take.	N
482	00:36:07	00:36:11	Is that why you missed last year's anniversary?	Y
483	00:36:11	00:36:14	And my night vision still sucks.	Y
484	00:36:17	00:36:19	Johnny?	N
485	00:36:25	00:36:27	I don't want to talk about him.	Y
486	00:36:27	00:36:32	Well, you, uh, kept him for several days before you chopped him up.	Y
487	00:36:32	00:36:34	Were you having a good time?	Y
488	00:36:39	00:36:42	I'm not into boys.	Y
489	00:36:44	00:36:46	Kid was in my freezer.	Y
490	00:37:00	00:37:02	Wait a minute.	N
491	00:37:05	00:37:07	There are six here.	N
492	00:37:07	00:37:09	We only know of five.	N
493	00:37:16	00:37:19	Tell us about Charlene Roth.	N
494	00:37:20	00:37:22	You had to bring her up.	N
495	00:37:22	00:37:27	You know, I tried to talk him out of it, but, uh, J.M wouldn't...	Y
496	00:37:27	00:37:29	John Mathers.	N
497	00:37:31	00:37:34	He had something to prove.	N
498	00:37:34	00:37:39	See, he didn't understand that we were better together than we would ever be apart.	Y
499	00:37:42	00:37:44	He needed me.	Y
500	00:37:44	00:37:46	Soul mates.	N
501	00:37:46	00:37:50	Contrary to popular belief, even people like us have souls.	N
502	00:37:53	00:38:04	I spent 15 years looking for a solid replacement, but you only get that lucky once in a lifetime.	Y
503	00:38:04	00:38:05	You miss him.	N
504	00:38:05	00:38:07	I created him.	N
505	00:38:07	00:38:09	But you let him take the fall.	Y
506	00:38:09	00:38:10	He got caught.	N
507	00:38:10	00:38:13	That's the price you pay for incompetence.	N
508	00:38:13	00:38:14	Death.	N
509	00:38:14	00:38:17	That's what you deserve when you make a mistake.	N
510	00:38:27	00:38:29	There's a sixth victim.	N
511	00:38:29	00:38:30	A Brit or Brittany Mosscoe.	Y
512	00:38:30	00:38:32	Her name was on a Ziploc bag in Greer's freezer.	Y
513	00:38:32	00:38:33	It contained a lock of hair.	N
514	00:38:33	00:38:35	Sara's looking into Missing Persons.	N
515	00:38:35	00:38:38	And Mia's running it through DNA.	N
516	00:38:38	00:38:40	Thanks.	N
517	00:38:49	00:38:51	Where is, uh...	N
518	00:38:53	00:38:55	Brit Mosscoe?	Y
519	00:39:01	00:39:04	There's a lot of fight in her.	Y
520	00:39:06	00:39:09	Is she old or new?	Y
521	00:39:14	00:39:17	I'll take you to her.	Y
522	00:39:19	00:39:23	Oh, we'll need a full tank of gas.	Y
523	00:39:35	00:39:36	Hello.	N
524	00:39:36	00:39:45	Yeah, I'm trying to confirm that you have no record of a Brit Mosscoe attending WLVU in the last 18 years.	Y
525	00:39:45	00:39:49	What about a night student?	N
526	00:39:49	00:39:51	Okay, thanks.	N
527	00:40:24	00:40:30	Hey, uh, can I go to the bathroom before we go?	Y
528	00:40:30	00:40:33	Yeah, okay.	N
529	00:40:37	00:40:40	Bobbie, pat him down.	Y
530	00:41:18	00:41:19	Slow down.	N
531	00:41:21	00:41:22	Okay...	N
532	00:41:24	00:41:25	Okay.	N
533	00:41:26	00:41:27	I got it.	N
534	00:41:29	00:41:30	The sixth victim is a ruse.	N
535	00:41:31	00:41:32	He drew her off a calendar.	Y
536	00:41:32	00:41:36	Brit Mosscoe is an anagram for Miss October.	Y
537	00:41:38	00:41:40	So where's he taking us?	Y
538	00:41:40	00:41:42	Mr. Greer, let's go. Come on.	Y
539	00:41:42	00:41:43	Mr. Greer?	Y
540	00:41:44	00:41:45	Where is he, in there?	Y
541	00:41:45	00:41:48	Come on, Mr. Greer, let's go!	Y
542	00:41:49	00:41:50	Damn it!	N
543	00:41:58	00:41:59	Get a paramedic!	N
