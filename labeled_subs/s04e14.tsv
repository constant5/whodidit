1	1	1	00:00:14	00:00:16	Actually, it's what you need to get, rook.	N

3	3	3	00:00:18	00:00:21	You're off when I say you're off.	N
4	4	4	00:00:28	00:00:29	Don't forget the Ho-Hos.	N
5	5	5	00:00:48	00:00:51	Yeah...	N
6	6	6	00:00:52	00:00:54	I can help you over here, sir.	N
7	7	7	00:00:54	00:00:57	That's not what your light says.	N
8	8	8	00:00:58	00:00:59	Slow night?	N
9	9	9	00:00:59	00:01:00	Kind of.	N
10	10	10	00:01:01	00:01:05	Oh... can't forget the Ho-Hos.	N
11	11	11	00:01:17	00:01:20	What the hell is wrong with you people?	N
12	12	12	00:01:20	00:01:22	My wife is still in there!	N
13	13	13	00:01:23	00:01:25	Why isn't anybody helping my wife?!	N
14	14	14	00:01:28	00:01:30	Body count's five.	N
15	15	15	00:01:47	00:01:50	Officer Clay entered the store unaware of a robbery that was in progress.	N
16	16	16	00:01:50	00:01:53	Officer Fromansky came in after he heard a shot fired.	N
17	17	17	00:01:53	00:01:55	Engaged two suspects.	N
18	18	18	00:01:55	00:01:57	Lit the place up.	N
19	19	19	00:02:00	00:02:02	The ski masks are John Does.	N
20	20	20	00:02:02	00:02:05	The rest have wallet IDs.	N
21	21	21	00:02:13	00:02:17	Woman at the back is Julia Reed, cocktail waitress at the Tangiers.	N
22	22	22	00:02:22	00:02:29	Man on Aisle Four is Rufus Sanders, cab driver.	N
23	23	23	00:02:43	00:02:45	How you want us to handle this, Grissom?	N
24	24	24	00:02:46	00:02:49	Same way you'd eat an elephant...	N
25	25	25	00:02:49	00:02:53	one bite at a time.	N
26	26	26	00:02:57	00:02:59	Hey, Jim...	N
27	27	27	00:03:00	00:03:05	did you know that Charles Manson is only 5'2?	N
28	28	28	00:03:05	00:03:07	Yeah, little guys tend to overcompensate.	N
29	29	29	00:03:07	00:03:10	Do you remember the, uh, story about...	N
30	30	30	00:03:10	00:03:14	how and where the marshals found old Charlie when they raided Barker Ranch?	N
31	31	31	00:03:14	00:03:17	Yeah. I always, uh...	N
32	32	32	00:03:17	00:03:20	I always liked that story.	N
33	33	33	00:03:26	00:03:27	We need a medic!	N
34	34	34	00:03:30	00:03:34	and Volkswagen. On the road of life there are passengers and there are drivers.	N
35	35	35	00:04:04	00:04:07	All right, tell me what happened.	N
36	36	36	00:04:07	00:04:10	I was in my radio car when I heard shots fired.	N
37	37	37	00:04:10	00:04:12	I called for backup. I went in.	N
38	38	38	00:04:13	00:04:14	Clay, talk to me.	N
39	39	39	00:04:14	00:04:15	Clay!	N
40	40	40	00:04:22	00:04:23	How many shots you fire?	N
41	41	41	00:04:23	00:04:27	Three. No, four. I fired four.	N
42	42	42	00:04:27	00:04:30	Then what? I saw my partner on the floor.	N
43	43	43	00:04:30	00:04:32	I went towards him.	N
44	44	44	00:04:32	00:04:34	Second gunman came at me.	N
45	45	45	00:04:40	00:04:43	How many shots you fire at the second gunman, total?	N
46	46	46	00:04:44	00:04:46	Maybe-maybe five.	N
47	47	47	00:04:46	00:04:49	I'd taken a shot in my vest.	N
48	48	48	00:04:49	00:04:51	Hard to count under those conditions. Are you sure?	N
49	49	49	00:04:51	00:04:53	No, I'm not sure. That's why I said maybe...	N
50	50	50	00:04:55	00:04:57	...but I know I shot four at the third guy.	N
51	51	51	00:04:57	00:04:59	I was going to check on my partner.	N
52	52	52	00:04:59	00:05:01	I caught movement in the back.	N
53	53	53	00:05:01	00:05:03	Black coat, ski mask, gun...	N
54	54	54	00:05:03	00:05:04	I put him down.	N
55	55	55	00:05:09	00:05:10	He fire at you?	N
56	56	56	00:05:10	00:05:12	Didn't give him a chance.	N
57	57	57	00:05:12	00:05:13	All right, that's all we need for now.	N
58	58	58	00:05:13	00:05:16	I need your weapon.	N
59	59	59	00:05:17	00:05:19	My partner...	N
60	60	60	00:05:19	00:05:20	I want to be the one to tell his wife.	N
61	61	61	00:05:21	00:05:22	He was my responsibility.	N
62	62	62	00:05:22	00:05:24	All right.	N
63	63	63	00:05:26	00:05:29	All right, look, if you're not going to say it, I will.	N
64	64	64	00:05:30	00:05:34	Fromansky said he killed three, and there are two dead ski masks in there.	N
65	65	65	00:05:34	00:05:38	Now, you cranked him up pretty good on that vigilante case last year.	N
66	66	66	00:05:38	00:05:39	Is that going to be a problem?	N
67	67	67	00:05:40	00:05:42	No.	N
68	68	68	00:05:45	00:05:48	Everybody, could I please have your attention?	N
69	69	69	00:05:48	00:05:51	All right, folks, I know that you've been through an awful lot this evening.	N
70	70	70	00:05:51	00:05:59	If you could just bear with me a little longer, I need to talk with every one of you one at a time, so I promise to get you out of here as quickly as possible.	N
71	71	71	00:06:00	00:06:04	Is the, uh, guy in black the cocktail waitress' husband?	N
72	72	72	00:06:04	00:06:07	Yeah. Do you want him first?	N
73	73	73	00:06:07	00:06:09	I don't think he's ready for me just yet.	N
74	74	74	00:06:09	00:06:11	I'm going to get to him soon enough.	N
75	75	75	00:06:24	00:06:26	What happened to your assault in Henderson?	N
76	76	76	00:06:26	00:06:27	I closed it.	N
77	77	77	00:06:27	00:06:28	Where do you need me?	N
78	78	78	00:06:29	00:06:30	There's two more bodies over by the beer.	N
79	79	79	00:06:30	00:06:33	You got it.	N
80	80	80	00:06:38	00:06:40	Barely cleared the holster.	N
81	81	81	00:06:40	00:06:42	Reflex, maybe. Pulled the trigger before he had a target.	N
82	82	82	00:06:44	00:06:47	Not quick enough.	N
83	83	83	00:06:52	00:06:56	Those two guys came out of nowhere... made everybody go to the corner.	N
84	84	84	00:06:56	00:06:58	Where, specifically?	N
85	85	85	00:06:58	00:07:01	Uh... dry goods.	N
86	86	86	00:07:01	00:07:02	Then one guy grabs Celeste...	N
87	87	87	00:07:06	00:07:07	Which guy?	N
88	88	88	00:07:07	00:07:10	I was looking at his piece, not his face, okay?	N
89	89	89	00:07:10	00:07:11	Shotgun or handgun?	N
90	90	90	00:07:11	00:07:17	Shotgun. He drags her over to the registers, makes her open 'em up. She does.	N
91	91	91	00:07:17	00:07:21	They're pulling out the cash, and then he sees the cops roll up.	N
92	92	92	00:07:21	00:07:25	Second guy says, Everybody, get down and don't say a freaking word, so that's what I did.	N
93	93	93	00:07:26	00:07:28	And then...	N
94	94	94	00:07:29	00:07:30	And then?	N
95	95	95	00:07:31	00:07:34	Ankles and flashes and booms.	N
96	96	96	00:07:34	00:07:37	That's all I remember.	N
97	97	97	00:07:37	00:07:39	And you never moved from that spot?	N
98	98	98	00:07:39	00:07:41	No, I didn't.	N
99	99	99	00:07:41	00:07:43	Do you have somewhere you need to be?	N
100	100	100	00:07:47	00:07:49	I got to change my pants.	N
101	101	101	00:07:52	00:07:54	Sorry.	N
102	102	102	00:08:26	00:08:29	Well, you know, we're not the most modern store around.	N
103	103	103	00:08:29	00:08:31	How long is the surveillance loop?	N
104	104	104	00:08:31	00:08:33	About 24 hours.	N
105	105	105	00:08:42	00:08:45	What, uh... what happened to these tapes here?	N
106	106	106	00:08:45	00:08:46	Nothing.	N
107	107	107	00:08:46	00:08:48	These are active cameras, right?	N
108	108	108	00:08:48	00:08:50	Those VCRs are busted.	N
109	109	109	00:08:50	00:08:51	Never got 'em fixed.	N
110	110	110	00:08:51	00:08:53	You know, cutbacks.	N
111	111	111	00:08:53	00:08:54	Over the register and outside works.	N
112	112	112	00:08:54	00:08:56	That's all we really need.	N
113	113	113	00:08:56	00:08:57	Gotta keep an eye on the employees, right?	N
114	114	114	00:08:58	00:09:01	They steal worse than the customers.	N
115	115	115	00:09:14	00:09:16	You know, this guy hit a $75 jackpot.	N
116	116	116	00:09:16	00:09:19	Probably shoving quarters in his pockets when this whole thing went down.	N
117	117	117	00:09:19	00:09:20	The door was 20 feet away.	N
118	118	118	00:09:20	00:09:21	He probably could've made a run for it.	N
119	119	119	00:09:21	00:09:25	You know, after the MGM Grand fire, they found people fused to slot machines.	N
120	120	120	00:09:26	00:09:27	Never even made it out of their seats.	N
121	121	121	00:09:27	00:09:29	This guy probably thought it was his lucky day.	N
122	122	122	00:09:29	00:09:32	I'm sure he wasn't going to leave without his money.	N
123	123	123	00:09:34	00:09:39	We all just started running when those two psychos started shooting it out with the cop...	N
124	124	124	00:09:48	00:09:58	I took a first aid course about a hundred years ago, so I-I-I tried to keep pressure on the wound, but it just kept bleeding, you know?	N
125	125	125	00:09:58	00:10:02	I couldn't leave Rufus all alone, scared, dying.	N
126	126	126	00:10:02	00:10:04	You were friends?	N
127	127	127	00:10:04	00:10:05	Mm, sort of.	N
128	128	128	00:10:06	00:10:09	He-he'd come in a couple of times a week and play the quarter slots.	N
129	129	129	00:10:09	00:10:13	From where you and Rufus were, could you see Officer Fromansky?	N
130	130	130	00:10:13	00:10:15	Oh, the cop who saved us?	N
131	131	131	00:10:15	00:10:18	No. I couldn't see anything.	N
132	132	132	00:10:18	00:10:22	I just heard all that gunfire just blasting away.	N
133	133	133	00:10:57	00:10:58	Hey.	N
134	134	134	00:10:58	00:11:00	Hey.	N
135	135	135	00:11:00	00:11:03	Entry wound's on the left side.	N
136	136	136	00:11:03	00:11:04	There's no exit wound?	N
137	137	137	00:11:21	00:11:22	Skin's thicker on the back.	N
138	138	138	00:11:22	00:11:23	Captured the bullet.	N
139	139	139	00:11:23	00:11:25	We'll retrieve it at autopsy.	N
140	140	140	00:11:27	00:11:29	I was, uh...	N
141	141	141	00:11:29	00:11:32	holding Julia's hand trying to find a place to hide...	N
142	142	142	00:11:32	00:11:33	somewhere safe.	N
143	143	143	00:11:35	00:11:39	It was those stupid heels, you know.	N
144	144	144	00:11:39	00:11:41	She was always forgetting to bring her flats to work.	N
145	145	145	00:11:51	00:11:53	They didn't have to shoot her.	N
146	146	146	00:11:53	00:11:54	They were wearing masks.	N
147	147	147	00:11:54	00:11:56	We didn't even get a good look at them.	N
148	148	148	00:11:56	00:12:00	Mr. Reed, you can't look for reasons here.	N
149	149	149	00:12:02	00:12:04	We'll have it out in a second.	N
150	150	150	00:12:06	00:12:09	The trick is to apply even pressure all around.	N
151	151	151	00:12:11	00:12:13	Is there something wrong with tweezers?	N
152	152	152	00:12:13	00:12:16	They can mess up the striae.	N
153	153	153	00:12:16	00:12:20	You've got enough to deal with without my toolmarks in the mix.	N
154	154	154	00:12:20	00:12:22	Here we go.	N
155	155	155	00:12:23	00:12:25	Huh.	N
156	156	156	00:12:25	00:12:27	Paper or plastic?	N
157	157	157	00:12:34	00:12:38	Officer Clay's already been processed.	N
158	158	158	00:12:38	00:12:40	We wanted to get him to his family.	N
159	159	159	00:12:40	00:12:42	Did you get prints off the two suspects?	N
160	160	160	00:12:42	00:12:43	Uh, yeah.	N
161	161	161	00:12:43	00:12:45	They're right here.	N
162	162	162	00:12:45	00:12:48	And we also got bullets from both of them.	N
163	163	163	00:12:49	00:12:50	Good.	N
164	164	164	00:12:55	00:12:57	Prison tattoos.	N
165	165	165	00:12:57	00:13:00	They weren't virgins.	N
166	166	166	00:13:02	00:13:07	Hi, I was wondering if I might be able to speak with Celeste Turner.	N
167	167	167	00:13:07	00:13:08	She, uh, has a gunshot wound.	N
168	168	168	00:13:09	00:13:11	She was brought in from the grocery store robbery.	N
169	169	169	00:13:11	00:13:14	Right. Curtain Three.	N
170	170	170	00:13:14	00:13:17	Just out of surgery. Stable.	N
171	171	171	00:13:17	00:13:18	She's still pretty doped up, though.	N
172	172	172	00:13:19	00:13:21	You're going to have to come back later.	N
173	173	173	00:13:21	00:13:22	You going to need these?	N
174	174	174	00:13:22	00:13:24	Yes. Thank you.	N
175	175	175	00:13:24	00:13:31	What can you tell me about the little boy who was also brought in from the robbery incident?	N
176	176	176	00:13:31	00:13:34	Minor injuries. He's fine. Mostly shock.	N
177	177	177	00:13:34	00:13:36	He's with his mom.	N
178	178	178	00:13:36	00:13:37	Hell of a night, huh?	N
179	179	179	00:13:37	00:13:39	Take your kid to work, both end up shot.	N
180	180	180	00:13:39	00:13:44	Wait a minute. So, the little boy's mother is Celeste Turner?	N
181	181	181	00:13:44	00:13:45	Yeah.	N
182	182	182	00:14:09	00:14:12	Son of a bitch was behind her the whole time.	N
183	183	183	00:14:12	00:14:13	Yeah.	N
184	184	184	00:14:16	00:14:18	Okay, here's what I got so far...	N
185	185	185	00:14:19	00:14:21	There's our two DOA suspects.	N
186	186	186	00:14:22	00:14:25	Looks like they just walked in off the street.	N
187	187	187	00:14:27	00:14:31	Is there any sign of Fromansky's mystery gunner?	N
188	188	188	00:14:31	00:14:37	No. All the cars in the parking lot were accounted for, and the loading dock out back was deserted, so...	N
189	189	189	00:14:38	00:14:40	This is the only view of what went down.	N
190	190	190	00:14:46	00:14:47	And see here?	N
191	191	191	00:14:47	00:14:49	Here comes our cop.	N
192	192	192	00:14:49	00:14:52	Three, four feet away, doesn't even see him.	N
193	193	193	00:14:52	00:14:59	The thing I hate the most is the bad guys always know if there's going to be a gunfight.	N
194	194	194	00:15:01	00:15:04	Officer Clay's one shot went into the floor.	N
195	195	195	00:15:04	00:15:05	The bullet fragmented.	N
196	196	196	00:15:05	00:15:07	That's probably how that kid got hit.	N
197	197	197	00:15:07	00:15:13	But Officer Fromansky's Beretta and that suspect's TEC-9, they both had hollow .9 millimeters.	N
198	198	198	00:15:13	00:15:16	Between the two of them, they shot off 18 rounds.	N
199	199	199	00:15:16	00:15:18	Shotgun was a Mossberg, model 500.	N
200	200	200	00:15:18	00:15:19	Eight rounds fired.	N
201	201	201	00:15:19	00:15:22	Ammo was double-aught buckshot, nine pellets per shell.	N
202	202	202	00:15:22	00:15:27	18 bullets, a total of 26 shells, 72 pellets. Enjoy.	N
203	203	203	00:15:31	00:15:33	Firing two shots!	N
204	204	204	00:16:56	00:16:58	Warrick.	N
205	205	205	00:17:05	00:17:07	Grissom, we got a problem.	N
206	206	206	00:17:07	00:17:08	Only one?	N
207	207	207	00:17:08	00:17:11	We've identified all the bullets recovered at the scene.	N
208	208	208	00:17:11	00:17:14	There's no evidence of a third gunmen.	N
209	209	209	00:17:14	00:17:15	It gets worse.	N
210	210	210	00:17:15	00:17:19	The bullet that killed the cocktail waitress-- it came from Fromansky's gun.	N
211	211	211	00:17:24	00:17:25	How you feeling, Officer?	N
212	212	212	00:17:25	00:17:27	Little sore.	N
213	213	213	00:17:27	00:17:30	Desk duty hurts a lot more.	N
214	214	214	00:17:30	00:17:33	Is there anything you want to add to your statement?	N
215	215	215	00:17:33	00:17:37	What's he saying I did this time?	N
216	216	216	00:17:37	00:17:39	A bullet from your gun killed a cocktail waitress.	N
217	217	217	00:17:42	00:17:43	A ricochet.	N
218	218	218	00:17:43	00:17:45	No.	N
219	219	219	00:17:45	00:17:46	A clean shot.	N
220	220	220	00:17:46	00:17:48	Not possible.	N
221	221	221	00:17:48	00:17:50	No one at the scene saw a third gunman.	N
222	222	222	00:17:50	00:17:52	I would never shoot at a civilian.	N
223	223	223	00:17:52	00:17:56	I saw a guy wearing a ski mask, dark coat, holding a gun.	N
224	224	224	00:17:56	00:17:59	The girl was wearing a black sweater, carrying a purse.	N
225	225	225	00:17:59	00:18:00	I didn't shoot at that.	N
226	226	226	00:18:01	00:18:02	You'd just took a full load in the chest.	N
227	227	227	00:18:02	00:18:03	Maybe you were confused.	N
228	228	228	00:18:03	00:18:05	Wasn't confused.	N
229	229	229	00:18:06	00:18:11	Your statement says that you fired four shots at this third gunman.	N
230	230	230	00:18:11	00:18:12	Yeah.	N
231	231	231	00:18:12	00:18:16	Ballistics evidence shows that you spread five shots over the back wall.	N
232	232	232	00:18:16	00:18:18	So I fired more than I thought. So what.	N
233	233	233	00:18:18	00:18:22	I was engaged with multiple hostile targets You're not back in the Gulf.	N
234	234	234	00:18:22	00:18:23	You're a police officer.	N
235	235	235	00:18:23	00:18:24	You're supposed to identify a target.	N
236	236	236	00:18:24	00:18:26	And that's what I did.	N
237	237	237	00:18:27	00:18:31	What are you, pissed off because the last time you tried to jam me up didn't work?	N
238	238	238	00:18:31	00:18:32	Hey, ease up.	N
239	239	239	00:18:32	00:18:34	What I said in my statement is the truth.	N
240	240	240	00:18:34	00:18:38	The truth is, we have a dead civilian with your bullet in her.	N
241	241	241	00:18:42	00:18:44	This going to the next step?	N
242	242	242	00:18:44	00:18:47	It has to.	N
243	243	243	00:18:48	00:18:52	You're on administrative leave pending an IAB review.	N
244	244	244	00:18:54	00:18:58	There was no way I could warn that cop.	N
245	245	245	00:19:01	00:19:03	I wanted to...	N
246	246	246	00:19:03	00:19:08	but the guy was right there, under the counter...	N
247	247	247	00:19:08	00:19:11	pushing his gun right into my stomach.	N
248	248	248	00:19:14	00:19:16	I'm sorry.	N
249	249	249	00:19:16	00:19:19	You're not the one that pulled the trigger.	N
250	250	250	00:19:19	00:19:23	Ms. Turner, what was your son doing there with you?	N
251	251	251	00:19:23	00:19:26	Well, my ex was looking after him that night.	N
252	252	252	00:19:26	00:19:30	Then the son of a bitch shows up at the store.	N
253	253	253	00:19:30	00:19:32	Had a party to go to.	N
254	254	254	00:19:32	00:19:35	Practically shoved Henry out of the car.	N
255	255	255	00:19:35	00:19:36	I mean...	N
256	256	256	00:19:36	00:19:40	I'm not allowed to bring kids to work.	N
257	257	257	00:19:40	00:19:46	So I snuck Henry into the office, and I told him to stay there.	N
258	258	258	00:19:47	00:19:48	Then?	N
259	259	259	00:19:48	00:19:52	Then those two maniacs came in.	N
260	260	260	00:19:52	00:19:54	They shot that poor policeman.	N
261	261	261	00:19:59	00:20:03	And then everything just went crazy.	N
262	262	262	00:20:03	00:20:05	I was running, and I ran to go find Henry...	N
263	263	263	00:20:05	00:20:08	but I couldn't find him anywhere.	N
264	264	264	00:20:09	00:20:10	Henry!	N
265	265	265	00:20:14	00:20:17	That's all I remember.	N
266	266	266	00:20:22	00:20:24	Henry likes his candy, doesn't he?	N
267	267	267	00:20:25	00:20:28	He's got five cavities to prove it.	N
268	268	268	00:20:28	00:20:30	How'd you know?	N
269	269	269	00:20:30	00:20:34	Well, we found him in a storage cabinet, near the candy rack.	N
270	270	270	00:20:34	00:20:37	He never listens to me.	N
271	271	271	00:20:39	00:20:43	Double counts, two people in the room at all times.	N
272	272	272	00:20:43	00:20:48	When you're done, match the total amounts with the register receipts, okay?	N
273	273	273	00:20:48	00:20:55	So, explain to me what all the money was doing in the registers and not the store safe.	N
274	274	274	00:20:55	00:20:58	See that light? It's called a halo.	N
275	275	275	00:20:58	00:21:01	It's keyed to the sensor in the cash register.	N
276	276	276	00:21:01	00:21:07	Now, at a preset amount, that light goes off, letting the store manager know it's time to transfer the cash to the safe.	N
277	277	277	00:21:07	00:21:09	Now check this out...	N
278	278	278	00:21:14	00:21:16	Most of the halos are lit.	N
279	279	279	00:21:16	00:21:19	Maximum cash, just lying in the drawers.	N
280	280	280	00:21:19	00:21:21	So, those guys did their homework.	N
281	281	281	00:21:21	00:21:24	They picked the perfect time to hit. Mm-hmm.	N
282	282	282	00:21:24	00:21:30	AFIS hits on our suspects, both just recently released from five-year sentences at Lompoc.	N
283	283	283	00:21:30	00:21:32	California boys.	N
284	284	284	00:21:32	00:21:33	Born and raised.	N
285	285	285	00:21:33	00:21:35	Okay. Let's do this.	N
286	286	286	00:21:35	00:21:39	Officer Clay was killed by a single close-range shotgun blast to the back of the head.	N
287	287	287	00:21:39	00:21:42	Excessive penetration and laceration of the brain.	N
288	288	288	00:21:42	00:21:44	Suspect Clyde Tremmel...	N
289	289	289	00:21:44	00:21:47	The TEC-9 guy.	N
290	290	290	00:21:47	00:21:53	Two distant-range, medium-caliber gunshot wounds to the front of the chest, with penetration of the lung and heart.	N
291	291	291	00:21:54	00:21:55	Suspect Jack Delver...	N
292	292	292	00:21:55	00:21:57	Shotgun guy.	N
293	293	293	00:21:57	00:22:05	One distant-range, medium-caliber gunshot wound to the forehead. The bullet penetrated the brain and was recovered in the occipital lobe.	N
294	294	294	00:22:06	00:22:08	Rufus Sanders, bystander...	N
295	295	295	00:22:08	00:22:11	Five scattered buckshot perforations on the outer thigh.	N
296	296	296	00:22:11	00:22:14	One severed the femoral artery, resulting in massive hemorrhage.	N
297	297	297	00:22:14	00:22:18	And Julia Reed, cocktail waitress.	N
298	298	298	00:22:18	00:22:21	Single medium-caliber gunshot wound to the left chest.	N
299	299	299	00:22:21	00:22:28	The bullet perforated the lung and thoracic aorta, then perforated the opposite lung. And that's it.	N
300	300	300	00:22:28	00:22:30	Thanks, Doc.	N
301	301	301	00:22:37	00:22:39	Catherine, something bothering you?	N
302	302	302	00:22:39	00:22:41	A little.	N
303	303	303	00:22:41	00:22:44	Look, I came here to pick up my wife's body.	N
304	304	304	00:22:44	00:22:45	I already gave you my statement.	N
305	305	305	00:22:45	00:22:49	Well, we just need a few more details before we can release the body.	N
306	306	306	00:22:49	00:22:50	I promise this won't be long.	N
307	307	307	00:22:51	00:22:52	What?	N
308	308	308	00:22:52	00:22:57	Well, you said that your wife fell during the gunfight, that that's how you got separated.	N
309	309	309	00:22:57	00:22:58	Yeah.	N
310	310	310	00:22:58	00:23:02	Do you recall exactly how she fell?	N
311	311	311	00:23:02	00:23:03	Well, what do you mean?	N
312	312	312	00:23:03	00:23:04	How did she land?	N
313	313	313	00:23:04	00:23:09	Did she land sideways, backwards...?	N
314	314	314	00:23:09	00:23:12	She fell forward, I think.	N
315	315	315	00:23:12	00:23:13	She fell forward.	N
316	316	316	00:23:13	00:23:17	So her hands broke the fall, landed on her knees?	N
317	317	317	00:23:17	00:23:18	Yeah.	N
318	318	318	00:23:19	00:23:26	Well, there weren't any bruises or scrapes on her knees or elbows, which is leading me to believe that she didn't fall.	N
319	319	319	00:23:26	00:23:28	Well, what's-what's the difference?	N
320	320	320	00:23:28	00:23:29	She's dead.	N
321	321	321	00:23:30	00:23:39	Mr. Reed, there were a lot of bullets flying around that store and a lot of victims, and every detail is important, but they don't help if they're not accurate.	N
322	322	322	00:23:41	00:23:43	Well, when we started running...	N
323	323	323	00:23:45	00:23:46	she was right behind me.	N
324	324	324	00:23:52	00:23:58	She froze up.	N
325	325	325	00:23:58	00:24:02	Just stood there looking right at me...	N
326	326	326	00:24:02	00:24:05	scared out of her mind.	N
327	327	327	00:24:05	00:24:09	I... yelled at her to get down, to come over to me.	N
328	328	328	00:24:11	00:24:14	Sh-She wouldn't move.	N
329	329	329	00:24:14	00:24:17	I mean I'm...	N
330	330	330	00:24:17	00:24:20	I'm pretty sure I yelled.	N
331	331	331	00:24:20	00:24:23	Highlight the shots that killed the TEC-9 shooter.	N
332	332	332	00:24:25	00:24:29	Fromansky said that he fired three or four shots at that target.	N
333	333	333	00:24:29	00:24:31	He fired four.	N
334	334	334	00:24:31	00:24:32	That accounts for those shots.	N
335	335	335	00:24:40	00:24:44	Okay, the guy with the shotgun was killed with... one bullet.	N
336	336	336	00:24:44	00:24:48	Well, those four shots were definitely meant for him.	N
337	337	337	00:24:48	00:24:53	But this shot is closer to the second gunman than it is to the cocktail waitress.	N
338	338	338	00:24:53	00:24:58	Well, Fromansky was turning when he fired so his shots were spread out.	N
339	339	339	00:25:14	00:25:16	Okay.	N
340	340	340	00:25:17	00:25:22	Which means Fromansky fired four shots at a target at the back of the store.	N
341	341	341	00:25:23	00:25:24	Just like he said he did.	N
342	342	342	00:25:24	00:25:25	Yeah.	N
343	343	343	00:25:29	00:25:35	At the walk-through you said that you saw a third suspect at the back of the store.	N
344	344	344	00:25:35	00:25:37	Why did you make the decision to shoot?	N
345	345	345	00:25:37	00:25:39	I was in fear for my life.	N
346	346	346	00:25:39	00:25:41	Did you see a weapon?	N
347	347	347	00:25:41	00:25:42	Yes.	N
348	348	348	00:25:42	00:25:44	What kind?	N
349	349	349	00:25:45	00:25:48	A semiautomatic pistol.	N
350	350	350	00:25:48	00:25:50	So you fired first.	N
351	351	351	00:25:50	00:25:51	Yes.	N
352	352	352	00:25:51	00:25:53	Four times. Yes.	N
353	353	353	00:25:53	00:25:57	Can you explain the lack of evidence for a third suspect at the scene?	N
354	354	354	00:25:57	00:25:59	That's not my job.	N
355	355	355	00:26:02	00:26:06	Right or wrong, there'll be guys on the job who'll think this was personal.	N
356	356	356	00:26:06	00:26:08	They'd be wrong.	N
357	357	357	00:26:08	00:26:12	Did you see Julia Reed in your line of fire?	N
358	358	358	00:26:12	00:26:13	No.	N
359	359	359	00:26:15	00:26:23	According to Supervising Criminalist Grissom's report, you had an unobstructed view of Ms. Reed, so how do you explain the fact that you didn't see her?	N
360	360	360	00:26:25	00:26:27	I can't.	N
361	361	361	00:26:27	00:26:32	You don't deny that a bullet from your weapon killed her?	N
362	362	362	00:26:32	00:26:35	I'm not denying that.	N
363	363	363	00:26:35	00:26:38	But you can't explain it?	N
364	364	364	00:26:39	00:26:42	No.	N
365	365	365	00:26:42	00:26:45	Look, your partner was dead.	N
366	366	366	00:26:46	00:26:47	You'd been shot.	N
367	367	367	00:26:47	00:26:51	You saw someone you thought was a suspect and you fired.	N
368	368	368	00:26:51	00:26:56	Under those circumstances, any one of us could make a mistake.	N
369	369	369	00:26:56	00:26:59	Did you?	N
370	370	370	00:27:02	00:27:06	Officer Fromansky, answer the question.	N
371	371	371	00:27:11	00:27:13	He says yes, he's a bad cop.	N
372	372	372	00:27:13	00:27:17	He says no, he's a liar.	N
373	373	373	00:27:17	00:27:22	Maybe he really doesn't know what happened.	N
374	374	374	00:27:29	00:27:30	A little over.	N
375	375	375	00:27:30	00:27:33	Perfect.	N
376	376	376	00:27:33	00:27:36	Let's say I'm Fromansky.	N
377	377	377	00:27:41	00:27:44	There's nothing between Fromansky and the cocktail waitress.	N
378	378	378	00:27:44	00:27:46	I got a clean view and a clear shot.	N
379	379	379	00:27:49	00:27:53	Hey, take a look at this.	N
380	380	380	00:27:53	00:28:01	The cracks in the glass from shot 22 are terminated by the cracks from shot 23.	N
381	381	381	00:28:10	00:28:13	So, shot 23 had to occur before shot 22.	N
382	382	382	00:28:13	00:28:20	Which means that Fromansky was firing from left to right, not right to left.	N
383	383	383	00:28:27	00:28:30	Four shots on a level spread.	N
384	384	384	00:28:30	00:28:32	He was shooting at a moving target.	N
385	385	385	00:28:32	00:28:36	According to Catherine's witness, the cocktail waitress wasn't moving.	N
386	386	386	00:28:36	00:28:38	She was a stationary target.	N
387	387	387	00:28:40	00:28:46	So, if he was shooting at a moving target, where was it moving to?	N
388	388	388	00:29:07	00:29:09	We have the surveillance tape.	N
389	389	389	00:29:09	00:29:15	Shows nothing going on here before, during or after the robbery.	N
390	390	390	00:29:16	00:29:22	Well, just because it shows nothing doesn't mean it's seeing everything.	N
391	391	391	00:29:24	00:29:26	You can see me now, right?	N
392	392	392	00:29:26	00:29:28	Keep moving to your right.	N
393	393	393	00:29:28	00:29:30	All right.	N
394	394	394	00:29:30	00:29:32	Keep going.	N
395	395	395	00:29:32	00:29:33	I'm still in?	N
396	396	396	00:29:33	00:29:34	Keep going.	N
397	397	397	00:29:34	00:29:36	Right there.	N
398	398	398	00:29:36	00:29:37	NOW you're out.	N
399	399	399	00:29:54	00:29:55	Tell me what you see.	N
400	400	400	00:29:55	00:29:58	A getaway.	N
401	401	401	00:30:04	00:30:07	We found metal paint scrapings and skid marks.	N
402	402	402	00:30:07	00:30:08	Both recent on that loading dock.	N
403	403	403	00:30:08	00:30:10	These guys definitely had a wheelman.	N
404	404	404	00:30:10	00:30:13	Yeah, guy slips in after everything gets started.	N
405	405	405	00:30:13	00:30:15	During the confusion, nobody sees him.	N
406	406	406	00:30:15	00:30:17	Or no one that was alive to tell anyway.	N
407	407	407	00:30:17	00:30:19	Except Fromansky. Yeah.	N
408	408	408	00:30:19	00:30:20	Well, the suspects knew there was a blind spot.	N
409	409	409	00:30:21	00:30:22	It has to be an inside job.	N
410	410	410	00:30:22	00:30:23	Oh, no doubt.	N
411	411	411	00:30:23	00:30:27	Matched the cash from the garbage bag to the register receipts-- $878 was missing.	N
412	412	412	00:30:27	00:30:29	Somebody came out ahead.	N
413	413	413	00:30:29	00:30:30	Inside guy?	N
414	414	414	00:30:30	00:30:32	Well, I'll run the employees.	N
415	415	415	00:30:32	00:30:35	Maybe somebody's got a record.	N
416	416	416	00:30:46	00:30:49	Ran your paint chips through PPG and DuPont.	N
417	417	417	00:30:49	00:30:50	Got a hit.	N
418	418	418	00:30:50	00:30:52	Aegean blue Honda Accord.	N
419	419	419	00:30:52	00:30:54	Popular color.	N
420	420	420	00:30:54	00:30:55	They carried it over for four years.	N
421	421	421	00:30:55	00:30:56	Go figure.	N
422	422	422	00:30:57	00:30:59	I'm a teal man myself.	N
423	423	423	00:30:59	00:31:01	You?	N
424	424	424	00:31:03	00:31:05	Stupid question.	N
425	425	425	00:31:05	00:31:08	Anyway, model years '84 to '87.	N
426	426	426	00:31:08	00:31:10	I'll put out a broadcast.	N
427	427	427	00:31:10	00:31:11	Thanks, Hodges.	N
428	428	428	00:31:11	00:31:12	Sure.	N
429	429	429	00:31:18	00:31:21	Before this goes any deeper, I want to hear it from you.	N
430	430	430	00:31:22	00:31:24	Are you going to try to screw me on this?	N
431	431	431	00:31:28	00:31:30	Well?	N
432	432	432	00:31:30	00:31:34	I guess it depends on whether I get stuck in traffic on the way to your hearing.	N
433	433	433	00:31:45	00:31:48	So, this car was reported stolen about, uh, oh, about three weeks ago.	N
434	434	434	00:31:49	00:31:50	Why don't you take the front.	N
435	435	435	00:31:50	00:31:53	I'll take the back.	N
436	436	436	00:32:28	00:32:31	pH 13. Sodium hydroxide.	N
437	437	437	00:32:42	00:32:45	Got a cell phone.	N
438	438	438	00:32:45	00:32:47	There's a lot of scung on it.	N
439	439	439	00:32:47	00:32:52	Won't be too good for prints, but let me check the call history.	N
440	440	440	00:32:55	00:32:57	Same number keeps popping up.	N
441	441	441	00:33:03	00:33:06	Best Bargain is temporarily closed.	N
442	442	442	00:33:06	00:33:08	Please check back tomorrow.	N
443	443	443	00:33:08	00:33:11	Well, this is interesting.	N
444	444	444	00:33:11	00:33:17	Before the robbery went down, somebody at the store was very eager to talk to our suspects.	N
445	445	445	00:33:18	00:33:19	Same number.	N
446	446	446	00:33:19	00:33:20	Yeah?	N
447	447	447	00:33:21	00:33:23	Maybe he can tell us who.	N
448	448	448	00:33:28	00:33:29	Todd Hallickey.	N
449	449	449	00:33:29	00:33:34	Look, I don't know why you guys brought me here, but you got no right tossing my apartment.	N
450	450	450	00:33:34	00:33:39	We matched your prints from a stolen car off the prints from a prior car theft, and bingo, we had a match.	N
451	451	451	00:33:39	00:33:41	Got a warrant for your apartment.	N
452	452	452	00:33:42	00:33:44	I don't boost cars no more.	N
453	453	453	00:33:44	00:33:46	Yeah, right.	N
454	454	454	00:33:47	00:33:48	Oh, wait. No, I...	N
455	455	455	00:33:48	00:33:53	I was looking into getting some wheels a couple of weeks ago.	N
456	456	456	00:33:53	00:33:57	I test-drove this old Honda Accord this guy was trying to unload.	N
457	457	457	00:33:57	00:34:02	An '86 Aegean blue with matching velour interior?	N
458	458	458	00:34:02	00:34:03	Yeah, that was it.	N
459	459	459	00:34:03	00:34:05	Must be how my print got there.	N
460	460	460	00:34:06	00:34:08	Didn't buy the car.	N
461	461	461	00:34:08	00:34:10	Guy seemed kind of shady.	N
462	462	462	00:34:10	00:34:15	You wouldn't happen to remember this shady guy's name, would you?	N
463	463	463	00:34:15	00:34:16	Come on.	N
464	464	464	00:34:16	00:34:19	No one keeps track of stuff like that.	N
465	465	465	00:34:19	00:34:21	Right.	N
466	466	466	00:34:22	00:34:25	You own any firearms, Mr. Hallickey?	N
467	467	467	00:34:25	00:34:26	No, sir, I'm on parole.	N
468	468	468	00:34:27	00:34:30	Besides, I don't believe in guns.	N
469	469	469	00:34:30	00:34:32	They're dangerous.	N
470	470	470	00:34:32	00:34:34	You know, that's a nasty injury you got there, Todd.	N
471	471	471	00:34:34	00:34:36	Looks kind of painful.	N
472	472	472	00:34:36	00:34:37	How'd you get it?	N
473	473	473	00:34:37	00:34:38	It's a rash.	N
474	474	474	00:34:38	00:34:41	Looks like a chemical burn to me.	N
475	475	475	00:34:41	00:34:43	You know what sodium hydroxide is?	N
476	476	476	00:34:43	00:34:45	Never heard of it.	N
477	477	477	00:34:45	00:34:47	It's the active ingredient in drain cleaner.	N
478	478	478	00:34:47	00:34:51	It opens up the pipes, dissolves flesh and fabrics.	N
479	479	479	00:34:57	00:35:02	Look, you want to pin that car on me, you go ahead and try.	N
480	480	480	00:35:02	00:35:05	I got this off the jacket from your apartment.	N
481	481	481	00:35:05	00:35:07	What the hell is this?	N
482	482	482	00:35:07	00:35:08	It's a bullet wipe.	N
483	483	483	00:35:08	00:35:11	A test for lead.	N
484	484	484	00:35:14	00:35:16	Congratulations.	N
485	485	485	00:35:16	00:35:18	You passed.	N
486	486	486	00:35:22	00:35:25	Hallickey's got no connection to the grocery store.	N
487	487	487	00:35:25	00:35:26	He was just the wheel man.	N
488	488	488	00:35:26	00:35:28	Still, he's looking at four counts of felony murder.	N
489	489	489	00:35:28	00:35:30	But he's not talking. He lawyered up.	N
490	490	490	00:35:31	00:35:32	We got a bullet hole in a jacket.	N
491	491	491	00:35:32	00:35:34	That's not even enough to prove that he was in the store.	N
492	492	492	00:35:35	00:35:35	What about the cash?	N
493	493	493	00:35:36	00:35:36	It wasn't in his apartment.	N
494	494	494	00:35:37	00:35:38	Maybe somebody else took it.	N
495	495	495	00:35:39	00:35:40	Almost $900 in small bills?	N
496	496	496	00:35:40	00:35:43	We'd have noticed pockets bulging with a wad like that.	N
497	497	497	00:35:43	00:35:46	What about the calls from the grocery store to the suspect's cell?	N
498	498	498	00:35:47	00:35:49	That could have been somebody giving the go signal.	N
499	499	499	00:35:49	00:35:50	There's no way to tell who.	N
500	500	500	00:35:50	00:35:56	The store runs off of an old PBX system, and every call that comes in goes back to the same number.	N
501	501	501	00:35:56	00:35:59	Every employee was near a phone, so, it could have been anybody.	N
502	502	502	00:35:59	00:36:00	Hey, y'all.	N
503	503	503	00:36:00	00:36:02	Ran the criminal records for the employees.	N
504	504	504	00:36:02	00:36:04	Came up with a Raul Valdez.	N
505	505	505	00:36:04	00:36:05	Freight loader.	N
506	506	506	00:36:05	00:36:07	He clocked in for work that night.	N
507	507	507	00:36:07	00:36:09	Never clocked out.	N
508	508	508	00:36:10	00:36:13	No one by that name interviewed at the scene?	N
509	509	509	00:36:14	00:36:15	Here's the kicker.	N
510	510	510	00:36:15	00:36:17	A few years ago, he spent some time in prison.	N
511	511	511	00:36:17	00:36:18	Lompoc.	N
512	512	512	00:36:18	00:36:22	So, Brass is trying to find him now.	N
513	513	513	00:37:06	00:37:07	I got to change my pants.	N
514	514	514	00:37:33	00:37:37	You left something in the store besides a urine stain.	N
515	515	515	00:37:40	00:37:42	Just a little too tempting, huh?	N
516	516	516	00:37:42	00:37:46	All that cash just sitting there right in front of your face...	N
517	517	517	00:37:52	00:37:57	Look, I go to that store to bag groceries, not to get my ass shot off.	N
518	518	518	00:37:57	00:38:00	I figure I earned the money.	N
519	519	519	00:38:00	00:38:01	Kind of like working overtime.	N
520	520	520	00:38:01	00:38:03	Might as well get something for all your trouble, right?	N
521	521	521	00:38:04	00:38:07	Considering the fact that your nice little robbery had gone straight to hell.	N
522	522	522	00:38:07	00:38:08	Whoa, wait a minute.	N
523	523	523	00:38:08	00:38:09	You think...?	N
524	524	524	00:38:09	00:38:11	No way.	N
525	525	525	00:38:11	00:38:12	It was an inside job.	N
526	526	526	00:38:12	00:38:14	You knew the registers were full.	N
527	527	527	00:38:14	00:38:17	Those gunmen had help from an employee.	N
528	528	528	00:38:17	00:38:18	Not from me, they didn't.	N
529	529	529	00:38:18	00:38:23	Look, you want to bust me for the money, go ahead, I took it.	N
530	530	530	00:38:23	00:38:25	But I did not set the thing up.	N
531	531	531	00:38:37	00:38:41	You know, Hodges already analyzed trace on the bullets.	N
532	532	532	00:38:41	00:38:43	Yeah, I wanted to take a look myself.	N
533	533	533	00:38:43	00:38:45	He'll take it personally.	N
534	534	534	00:38:45	00:38:46	Good.	N
535	535	535	00:38:50	00:38:56	The report says that the cocktail waitress was wearing a black wool sweater.	N
536	536	536	00:38:56	00:39:00	Was she also wearing something polyester?	N
537	537	537	00:39:00	00:39:02	No.	N
538	538	538	00:39:02	00:39:04	Take a look at this.	N
539	539	539	00:39:09	00:39:11	Black fibers.	N
540	540	540	00:39:11	00:39:13	Probably synthetic.	N
541	541	541	00:39:14	00:39:16	Mixed in with the wool.	N
542	542	542	00:39:18	00:39:23	If their gunman was wearing a black polyester jacket...	N
543	543	543	00:39:23	00:39:27	Fromansky claims that he was tunnel-visioned on the gunman.	N
544	544	544	00:39:27	00:39:33	So, it's possible that he never even saw the cocktail waitress.	N
545	545	545	00:39:49	00:39:52	You may have just saved Fromansky's ass.	N
546	546	546	00:39:54	00:39:56	Hey, Catherine, how'd it go with the bag boy?	N
547	547	547	00:39:56	00:40:00	He admitted to swiping the cash, but he wouldn't cop to the robbery.	N
548	548	548	00:40:00	00:40:02	Then I have something you should see.	N
549	549	549	00:40:02	00:40:10	I was going back through the surveillance tapes covering the loading dock, thinking I might find someone scouting a blind spot, you know?	N
550	550	550	00:40:10	00:40:13	But instead, I found this.	N
551	551	551	00:40:13	00:40:17	Two nights before the robbery.	N
552	552	552	00:40:17	00:40:20	There.	N
553	553	553	00:40:20	00:40:21	See that?	N
554	554	554	00:40:21	00:40:23	One more time.	N
555	555	555	00:40:26	00:40:30	That camera's stationary, so...	N
556	556	556	00:40:30	00:40:33	Somebody moved the camera.	N
557	557	557	00:40:35	00:40:38	You used to part-time at the Forum shops.	N
558	558	558	00:40:38	00:40:40	We got your prints off your work card.	N
559	559	559	00:40:41	00:40:45	It was the same print that we got off the loading dock surveillance camera.	N
560	560	560	00:40:52	00:40:57	Raul Valdez, an ex-con-- your co-worker.	N
561	561	561	00:40:57	00:41:01	You got him to give you the names of some guys to do the job.	N
562	562	562	00:41:01	00:41:05	You give them the best time to hit the registers.	N

564	564	564	00:41:08	00:41:10	It's a good plan.	N
565	565	565	00:41:10	00:41:14	Until your ex showed up and leaves you with your kid.	N
566	566	566	00:41:14	00:41:19	Then you panic, and you call your guys, try to call it off, but they won't listen.	N
567	567	567	00:41:19	00:41:23	If that's what happened, that could go in your favor.	N
568	568	568	00:41:24	00:41:26	When we find Raul, he'll give you up in a heartbeat.	N
569	569	569	00:41:26	00:41:29	I think I need to get a lawyer.	N
570	570	570	00:41:29	00:41:32	What you need is come clean and cooperate.	N
571	571	571	00:41:32	00:41:38	And you better hope and pray the DA doesn't want to put a needle in your arm for killing five people, including a cop.	N
572	572	572	00:41:43	00:41:48	I have been working at that store for five years.	N
573	573	573	00:41:48	00:41:51	38 hours a week.	N
574	574	574	00:41:51	00:41:56	38... not 40.	N
575	575	575	00:41:56	00:41:58	You know why?	N
576	576	576	00:41:58	00:42:05	Because my manager won't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits.	N
577	577	577	00:42:09	00:42:11	I have a kid...	N
578	578	578	00:42:11	00:42:14	with rotten teeth.	N
579	579	579	00:42:19	00:42:22	I never meant for anybody to get hurt.	N
580	580	580	00:42:31	00:42:35	Officer Fromansky, if you could smile, please?	N
581	581	581	00:42:35	00:42:36	Thank you; right over here.	N
582	582	582	00:42:36	00:42:38	Guy from the mayor's office.	N
583	583	583	00:42:38	00:42:40	Fromansky's getting a commendation.	N
584	584	584	00:42:40	00:42:42	What do you think?	N
585	585	585	00:42:42	00:42:46	Two dead felons, two dead civilians a dead policeman...	N
