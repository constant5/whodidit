0	00:01:17	00:01:20	NO!	N
1	00:01:39	00:01:41	Excuse me.	N
2	00:01:41	00:01:42	My name's Gil Grissom.	N
3	00:01:42	00:01:44	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
4	00:01:44	00:01:45	Please help us.	N
5	00:01:45	00:01:47	I'll certainly try.	N
6	00:01:50	00:01:52	Is that the ransom note?	N
7	00:01:52	00:01:56	Yeah. They don't even say how much money they want.	Y
8	00:01:56	00:01:58	They just say that they'll call us in six hours.	Y
9	00:01:58	00:02:01	Have you let anyone else touch this note?	N
10	00:02:01	00:02:03	Police, a relative, anyone?	N
11	00:02:03	00:02:04	N-no, just us. Why?	N
12	00:02:04	00:02:08	Well, because the person who touched it before you has your son...	N
13	00:02:08	00:02:11	and he's just left us the first piece of the puzzle.	N
14	00:02:48	00:02:50	Jim, Dispatch said this is a kidnapping?	N
15	00:02:50	00:02:51	Divorce situation?	N
16	00:02:51	00:02:53	No papers filed.College sweethearts.	N
17	00:02:53	00:02:55	Neighbors say they're the salt of the earth.	N
18	00:02:56	00:02:57	So this could have been legitimate?	N
19	00:02:57	00:02:59	They have a security system.	N
20	00:02:59	00:03:01	Never put it on.	N
21	00:03:01	00:03:02	They say how come?	N
22	00:03:02	00:03:04	They feel safe in the neighborhood.	N
23	00:03:04	00:03:06	Check the premises?	N
24	00:03:06	00:03:08	Attic, wine cellar, crawl space.	N
25	00:03:08	00:03:09	No four-month-old baby.	N
26	00:03:12	00:03:13	Nice digs.	N
27	00:03:13	00:03:15	Yeah, guy got rich off some dot-com outfit.	N
28	00:03:15	00:03:17	Moved here from Oregon two years ago.	N
29	00:03:17	00:03:19	Bet they wished they hadn't today.	N
30	00:03:19	00:03:21	Are you sure he won't hear a click or something?	N
31	00:03:21	00:03:23	He won't.	N
32	00:03:23	00:03:25	And if he asks, you and your wife are alone.	N
33	00:03:25	00:03:26	Question him about your son.	N
34	00:03:26	00:03:28	Ask to hear him breathing.	N
35	00:03:28	00:03:29	Anything to keep the guy talking.	N
36	00:03:29	00:03:30	Understood?	N
37	00:03:30	00:03:31	I don't know.	N
38	00:03:31	00:03:33	Yeah, yeah.	N
39	00:03:33	00:03:34	Okay.	N
40	00:03:34	00:03:36	Built my own business.	N
41	00:03:36	00:03:38	I can handle any kind of pressure.	N
42	00:03:42	00:03:43	Was this yours?	N
43	00:03:43	00:03:46	Yeah.	N
44	00:03:46	00:03:48	May I ask when you opened it?	N
45	00:03:48	00:03:49	I don't know.	N
46	00:03:50	00:03:52	Um, sometime after we called 9-1-1.	N
47	00:03:55	00:03:57	You mind if I, uh...?	N
48	00:03:57	00:03:59	No, no, go ahead.	N
49	00:04:14	00:04:15	You have any more of these?	N
50	00:04:15	00:04:17	In the fridge.	N
51	00:04:17	00:04:19	Thanks.	N
52	00:04:19	00:04:21	Do my boys have to be here?	N
53	00:04:21	00:04:25	I think this is hard enough for them without having to hear the facts.	N
54	00:04:25	00:04:29	I understand, but it's best for our investigation if we keep the whole family together.	N
55	00:04:29	00:04:31	It's okay, Mom.	N
56	00:04:31	00:04:33	You were saying, Mrs. Anderson?	N
57	00:04:33	00:04:34	Um...	N
58	00:04:34	00:04:39	30, like I usually do to feed Zack.	N
59	00:04:39	00:04:41	I'm still breast-feeding.	N
60	00:04:41	00:04:43	And I went down to Zacky's room.	N
61	00:04:43	00:04:45	I looked in his crib and he was gone.	N
62	00:04:45	00:04:47	He wasn't there.	N
63	00:04:47	00:04:52	And I felt around for him and that's when I found the letter saying that he had been taken and I...I don't know.	Y
64	00:04:52	00:04:56	I-I think I screamed...	Y
65	00:04:56	00:04:57	You screamed, Mom.	N
66	00:04:57	00:05:04	I jumped out of bed and I went to her, and that's when we called 9-1-1 from the upstairs hallway.	N
67	00:05:05	00:05:07	9-1-1-1-1-1.	N
68	00:05:07	00:05:09	Give me the phone, Robbie.	N
69	00:05:09	00:05:11	We're going to need a piece of the baby's clothing.	N
70	00:05:11	00:05:14	Something from his hamper, if possible.	Y
71	00:05:14	00:05:16	We're going to use scent dogs throughout the neighborhood.	N
72	00:05:16	00:05:19	I'll go see what I can find.	N
73	00:05:19	00:05:20	No, I know what he wears.	N
74	00:05:20	00:05:22	I'll go with you.	N
75	00:05:25	00:05:30	I'd also like to get blood samples from each family member.	N
76	00:05:30	00:05:37	Why? Well, the sooner we can eliminate the expected hairs and fibers from within the household we can begin looking for outsiders.	N
77	00:05:37	00:05:38	Is it going to hurt?	N
78	00:05:39	00:05:42	I hope not.	N
79	00:05:52	00:05:53	Sara?	N
80	00:05:53	00:05:54	Yeah?	N
81	00:05:54	00:05:55	Take this ransom note to Q.D.	N
82	00:05:55	00:05:56	Typewritten ransom note?	N
83	00:05:56	00:05:57	Kidnapper was organized.	N
84	00:05:58	00:06:00	I think it's ink-jet not typewriter.	N
85	00:06:00	00:06:04	I'll get it to Questioned Documents check for origination prints, the works.	N
86	00:06:04	00:06:07	Take every computer and printer from the Anderson house with you.	N
87	00:06:07	00:06:11	You think the suspect printed the ransom note from inside the house while they were sleeping?	N
88	00:06:11	00:06:13	I'm not thinking anything yet.	N
89	00:06:13	00:06:15	Nick?	N
90	00:06:15	00:06:16	Yo.	N
91	00:06:16	00:06:18	No, thanks, I'm an iced tea man.	N
92	00:06:18	00:06:20	It's not a refreshment.	N
93	00:06:20	00:06:21	It's an experiment.	N
94	00:06:21	00:06:25	Now take this to the lab in a controlled space, 72 degrees Fahrenheit and open it.	N
95	00:06:25	00:06:28	Keep this in the same room-temp space.	N
96	00:06:28	00:06:30	Okay, then what?	N
97	00:06:30	00:06:33	Process, Nick, process.	N
98	00:06:35	00:06:38	Baby's bedroom window is open and the ladder's still out there.	N
99	00:06:38	00:06:40	So canvass the whole grounds from outside to in.	N
100	00:06:41	00:06:43	I'm all over it like a cheap suit.	N
101	00:07:32	00:07:33	You see this spiderweb?	N
102	00:07:33	00:07:34	Damn, Warrick!	N
103	00:07:34	00:07:36	I'm sorry.	N
104	00:07:36	00:07:37	Your ticker okay?	N
105	00:07:39	00:07:40	What spiderweb?	N
106	00:07:40	00:07:43	Right here.	N
107	00:07:43	00:07:49	Kind of hard to get a baby out of a window climb onto a ladder without messing up this web, don't you think?	N
108	00:07:49	00:07:51	Well, it could have happened after the abduction.	N
109	00:07:51	00:07:55	Spiders can build one of these things in a few hours.	N
110	00:08:05	00:08:07	Warrick?	N
111	00:08:07	00:08:08	What are you doing?	N
112	00:08:08	00:08:11	Go around.	N
113	00:08:24	00:08:28	Ooh, you're right on the golf course.	N
114	00:08:28	00:08:30	That must be nice.	N
115	00:08:30	00:08:31	Steve likes it.	N
116	00:08:31	00:08:32	I never cared for the game.	N
117	00:08:36	00:08:40	That one's my favorite but Zacky, he, uh...	N
118	00:08:40	00:08:43	he liked another one.	N
119	00:08:43	00:08:45	Here it is.	Y
120	00:08:47	00:08:51	There's a little spit-up on it.	N
121	00:08:51	00:08:54	He liked the way the fabric felt on his skin.	N
122	00:09:00	00:09:03	Oh, God...	N
123	00:09:03	00:09:08	It's okay. It used to happen to me with my daughter if I didn't get to her right on time.	N
124	00:09:08	00:09:11	I can't believe that this is happening to us.	N
125	00:09:13	00:09:16	I'll get this to our guys.	N
126	00:09:29	00:09:31	What you got?	N
127	00:09:31	00:09:34	Two hair, separate and distinctive.	N
128	00:09:34	00:09:38	Ah, the plot thickens.	N
129	00:09:46	00:09:50	You smell something?	N
130	00:09:50	00:09:53	I smell these dirty diapers over here.	N
131	00:09:57	00:09:58	It's like a household cleanser.	N
132	00:09:58	00:10:00	There's a pine smell.	N
133	00:10:00	00:10:02	Probably used to clean that diaper pail.	N
134	00:10:02	00:10:04	No, it's stronger than that.	N
135	00:10:06	00:10:09	And it's emanating from this specific spot.	N
136	00:10:34	00:10:35	Whew.	N
137	00:10:37	00:10:40	Baby was killed before it even left the house.	N
138	00:10:40	00:10:42	Guy tried to cover his tracks.	N
139	00:10:42	00:10:46	What do you mean you haven't checked for prints?	Y
140	00:10:46	00:10:47	It's a ransom letter.	Y
141	00:10:47	00:10:50	Everything in the proper order.You know that.	N
142	00:10:50	00:10:53	I got five other tests I got to run on this paper before I try to isolate prints.	N
143	00:10:53	00:10:54	You got anything for me?	N
144	00:10:54	00:10:56	Yeah. The paper's expensive.	N
145	00:10:56	00:10:57	High rag count.	N
146	00:10:57	00:10:58	I could have told you that.	N
147	00:10:58	00:11:01	Can you explain these three small vertical dots?	N
148	00:11:01	00:11:02	What? Where?	N
149	00:11:02	00:11:07	It tells me that the printer that emitted this letter has a spot on the drum.	N
150	00:11:07	00:11:11	A drum goes around three times to print one page.	N
151	00:11:15	00:11:17	So if the Andersons' printer was used...	N
152	00:11:19	00:11:23	There'd be three small dots on any paper that comes out.	Y
153	00:11:25	00:11:26	No vertical dots.	N
154	00:11:26	00:11:31	And different paper than the ransom letter F.Y.I.	N
155	00:11:31	00:11:36	Yeah, this mold I made of that shoe print matches the gardener's boot that I found in the shed over there.	N
156	00:11:36	00:11:40	Yeah, well, we need to look for what's out of place.	N
157	00:11:40	00:11:43	And a gardener's boot in a garden is not out of place.	N
158	00:11:43	00:11:47	Well, the Andersons did say the guy's been out of town on vacation for the last three days.	N
159	00:11:49	00:11:50	Grissom.	N
160	00:11:50	00:11:53	Ransom note's not from the Anderson's printer or paper supply.	N
161	00:11:53	00:11:54	You're breaking up.	N
162	00:11:54	00:11:56	The Andersons are clear.	N
163	00:11:56	00:12:00	Whoever wrote the letter did it from a different location and brought it with them.	N
164	00:12:00	00:12:03	Are you standing next to the copy machine outside ballistics?	N
165	00:12:03	00:12:05	You want me to check ballistics?	N
166	00:12:05	00:12:08	No, I want you to move away from that machine.	N
167	00:12:08	00:12:12	Look, check all the printers at Steve Anderson's company.	N
168	00:12:13	00:12:15	Get Q.D. to help you with a warrant.	N
169	00:12:15	00:12:21	Target all immediate co-workers and disgruntled employees first.	N
170	00:12:21	00:12:22	Are those our dogs?	N
171	00:12:22	00:12:24	Grissom? Grissom!	N
172	00:12:40	00:12:41	Get those dogs back.	N
173	00:12:42	00:12:43	Get them back!	N
174	00:12:55	00:12:57	Stand back.	N
175	00:12:57	00:12:59	Well, we got to have pictures.	N
176	00:12:59	00:13:00	The coroner will be all over us.	N
177	00:13:00	00:13:03	I'll get the pictures!	N
178	00:13:24	00:13:26	I'm going to take him.	N
179	00:13:39	00:13:41	Oh, God, my baby!	Y
180	00:13:41	00:13:43	Oh, my God, my baby! No!	N
181	00:13:53	00:13:55	My baby!	N
182	00:13:55	00:13:58	My baby!	N
183	00:13:59	00:14:03	Oh, my God!	N
184	00:14:03	00:14:04	Oh, my God!	N
185	00:14:16	00:14:22	The Andersons, who own a profitable Internet company in Las Vegas, are said to be devastated by the death of little Zachary.	N
186	00:14:22	00:14:29	As for leads, the police will only say they have widened the investigation to include employees of Steve Anderson's company.	N
187	00:14:29	00:14:32	Immediate coworkers are being asked to give DNA samples.	N
188	00:14:32	00:14:36	By all accounts, the employees are complying voluntarily.	N
189	00:14:36	00:14:42	One of them is quoted as saying Anything to help Mr. and Mrs. Anderson in their time of grief.	N
190	00:14:42	00:14:49	I can't give you exact time of death, but I do know cause of death was asphyxiation.	N
191	00:14:49	00:14:51	He was smothered.	N
192	00:14:51	00:14:56	The retinal hemorrhages are the result of intercranial pressure from an edema.	N
193	00:14:56	00:15:00	The edema was caused by an acute lack of oxygen.	N
194	00:15:00	00:15:02	Smothered how?	N
195	00:15:02	00:15:05	Did you find hand marks trauma around the mouth or nose?	N
196	00:15:05	00:15:08	No.	N
197	00:15:09	00:15:11	He was in a blanket when I found him...	N
198	00:15:11	00:15:13	wrapped pretty tight.	N
199	00:15:13	00:15:15	Positional asphyxiation?	N
200	00:15:15	00:15:16	Maybe.	N
201	00:15:16	00:15:19	Abductor might have tried to protect him from the cold.	N
202	00:15:19	00:15:21	Suffocated him by mistake.	N
203	00:15:21	00:15:25	I'm going to run tests on a microscopic fiber I found in his throat.	N
204	00:15:27	00:15:30	But I don't think his death was benign, Gil.	N
205	00:15:30	00:15:31	Or accidental.	N
206	00:15:31	00:15:33	Sternum was cracked.	N
207	00:15:33	00:15:35	X-rays say the fracture is fresh.	N
208	00:15:35	00:15:38	Manhandled and suffocated.	N
209	00:15:38	00:15:41	This little guy didn't have a chance.	N
210	00:15:47	00:15:49	Are those from Anderson's company?	N
211	00:15:49	00:15:51	Yeah. There's like 200 of them in that place.	N
212	00:15:51	00:15:53	I'm going to test them against the ransom note, one by one.	N
213	00:15:53	00:15:55	You got Homicide's list of disgruntled employees?	N
214	00:15:55	00:15:57	They're still working on it.	N
215	00:15:57	00:16:00	You call Homicide back and tell them to get us that list now.	N
216	00:16:01	00:16:03	Hey.	N
217	00:16:03	00:16:08	Hey.Where are we on those DNA samples? I got the hair samples from the baby's crib ready for comparison.	N
218	00:16:08	00:16:11	Yeah? So answer my question.	N
219	00:16:11	00:16:13	Well, DNA's jammed.	N
220	00:16:13	00:16:16	Sanders says he'll get to the blood comparisons as soon as...	N
221	00:16:20	00:16:22	I hear you're backlogged.	N
222	00:16:23	00:16:26	20 Unknowns from some drug shoot-out.	N
223	00:16:26	00:16:28	FBI special request.	N
224	00:16:28	00:16:31	Sheriff told me to clear it off my counter before I do anything else.	N
225	00:16:31	00:16:32	These?	N
226	00:16:32	00:16:35	Yeah. You can almost smell Quantico, huh?	N
227	00:16:44	00:16:45	There.	N
228	00:16:45	00:16:48	Now they're off your counter.	N
229	00:16:48	00:16:52	Zachary Anderson, date of birth 01-23-01.	N
230	00:16:52	00:16:53	Date of death, three hours ago.	N
231	00:16:53	00:16:56	Until we find out how and why...	N
232	00:17:00	00:17:01	this is the only case you work on.	N
233	00:17:01	00:17:02	Yes, sir.	N
234	00:17:04	00:17:06	Never seen him like this before.	N
235	00:17:07	00:17:08	Grissom?	N
236	00:17:08	00:17:09	What?	N
237	00:17:09	00:17:14	You told me a few weeks ago that nothing is personal.	N
238	00:17:14	00:17:16	No victim should be special.	N
239	00:17:16	00:17:18	Everyone follows your lead.	N
240	00:17:18	00:17:21	Everyone didn't find that baby.	N
241	00:17:21	00:17:22	I did.	N
242	00:17:22	00:17:26	And that little boy is dead because someone lost their temper or screwed up, or God knows what.	Y
243	00:17:26	00:17:31	So, excuse me, but this victim is special.	Y
244	00:17:31	00:17:33	Mr. and Mrs. Anderson are calling.	N
245	00:17:33	00:17:36	They want to know why you refuse to release the body for burial.	Y
246	00:17:36	00:17:38	They said that you gave the coroner strict instructions.	Y
247	00:17:40	00:17:42	You better drive.	Y
248	00:17:42	00:17:44	Sure.	N
249	00:17:46	00:17:50	I'm very sorry, but we have to preserve the evidence in a case like this.	Y
250	00:17:50	00:17:54	And as difficult as this sounds, Zachary is evidence.	N
251	00:17:54	00:17:57	We need to refer to him as the case unfolds.	N
252	00:17:57	00:17:59	Well, do you have any leads?	N
253	00:17:59	00:18:00	Any idea who did this?	N
254	00:18:00	00:18:08	Your child was found 500 yards from your back door, in clean clothes wrapped in a white blanket, laid carefully under a statuary.	N
255	00:18:08	00:18:11	A stranger wouldn't treat a victim like that.	N
256	00:18:11	00:18:14	You think we had something to do with this?	N
257	00:18:14	00:18:17	The FBI tells us that you never received a call from the abductor.	N
258	00:18:18	00:18:21	What kind of a kidnapper forgets to call the family?	N
259	00:18:23	00:18:24	The wealthy family.	N
260	00:18:24	00:18:27	My lawyer warned me that you were going to try this.	N
261	00:18:27	00:18:29	You don't have a suspect so now you're going to come after us.	Y
262	00:18:29	00:18:30	But you have nothing to hide.	N
263	00:18:30	00:18:32	You're damn right we don't.	N
264	00:18:34	00:18:36	I thought I'd deliver this in person.	N
265	00:18:36	00:18:39	DNA came back on the entire family.	N
266	00:18:46	00:18:50	The blood we found in the baby's room...belongs to your son Tyler.	N
267	00:18:55	00:18:59	I was playing ball in the backyard and I cracked Zacky's window.	N
268	00:18:59	00:19:02	Dad had told me not to hit the ball towards the house.	N
269	00:19:02	00:19:09	So I went up and replaced the window before anyone got home and I cut my finger on the glass.	N
270	00:19:09	00:19:14	And you wiped up the blood with some type of pine cleanser.	N
271	00:19:14	00:19:15	I thought I got it all.	N
272	00:19:15	00:19:18	Let's go back a second, Tyler.	N
273	00:19:18	00:19:23	You said that you baby-sat for Robbie and Zack last night right?	Y
274	00:19:23	00:19:24	I told the police that this morning.	N
275	00:19:24	00:19:27	We had a Homeowner's Association Vote meeting.	N
276	00:19:27	00:19:29	It was just five doors up from our house.	N
277	00:19:29	00:19:33	I had, uh...I had made dinner and then Steve and I walked up to the clubhouse.	N
278	00:19:33	00:19:36	00.	N
279	00:19:36	00:19:38	We contacted the Association.	N
280	00:19:38	00:19:39	The story checks out.	N
281	00:19:39	00:19:42	I also did a background search.	N
282	00:19:42	00:19:44	Tyler has quite a temper on him, don't you, Ty?	N
283	00:19:44	00:19:45	What?	N
284	00:19:45	00:19:48	You were expelled from school twice last year for physical altercation.	N
285	00:19:48	00:19:51	That was school yard stuff.	N
286	00:19:51	00:19:54	Beat up a 12-year-old in the school stairwell.	N
287	00:19:54	00:19:56	He made fun of my mother.	N
288	00:19:58	00:20:00	I wasn't going to let him get away with that.	N
289	00:20:00	00:20:03	Your brother Zack say something you weren't going to let him get away with, either?	N
290	00:20:03	00:20:05	Don't talk about my brother thatway, you bastard.	N
291	00:20:06	00:20:08	Sit down. Now.	N
292	00:20:08	00:20:10	He's, uh...he's upset.	N
293	00:20:10	00:20:11	He is not usually like this.	N
294	00:20:15	00:20:17	People are calling us killers.	N
295	00:20:19	00:20:22	And I miss my little brother.	N
296	00:20:22	00:20:25	That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	N
297	00:20:37	00:20:40	So what are we looking for?	N
298	00:20:40	00:20:43	I don't know.	N
299	00:20:43	00:20:45	Well, let's start up and work our way down.	N
300	00:22:17	00:22:19	Here's the father's bottle of cola.	N
301	00:22:19	00:22:20	Here's the Unknown.	N
302	00:22:20	00:22:29	I duplicated conditions and monitored the pressure that escaped from the father's bottle which he'd told you had been open two hours against one I know was open two hours.	N
303	00:22:29	00:22:31	Kept this log.	N
304	00:22:31	00:22:36	Pressure released every quarter hour.	N
305	00:22:38	00:22:39	Good, Nick.	N
306	00:22:40	00:22:43	Did you find any ethanol on the lip of that bottle?	N
307	00:22:43	00:22:48	Well, I've got Trace running tests now, but I did an unscientific whiff test.	N
308	00:22:48	00:22:50	Picked up a hint of some kind of booze.	N
309	00:22:52	00:22:54	Call me when you get the results.	N
310	00:22:54	00:22:59	See if they can find out what this green substance is on these nylons I found in Mr. Anderson's closet.	N
311	00:22:59	00:23:02	I'll take a swatch, get it back to you ASAP.	N
312	00:23:05	00:23:06	The mother's prints...	N
313	00:23:06	00:23:10	the father's prints...	N
314	00:23:10	00:23:12	and a set of Unknowns.	N
315	00:23:12	00:23:13	They're not unknown.	N
316	00:23:13	00:23:20	I ran them against the employees of Steve Anderson's computer company disgruntled and otherwise.	N
317	00:23:20	00:23:23	They belong to a Needra Fenway.	N
318	00:23:24	00:23:26	And who is Needra Fenway?	N
319	00:23:26	00:23:29	Steve Anderson's secretary.	N
320	00:23:31	00:23:33	So, of course, I checked out her printer.	N
321	00:23:33	00:23:39	As I'm sure you know, all printers have their own unique signature.	N
322	00:23:45	00:23:46	These three...	N
323	00:23:46	00:23:53	tiny vertical dots from Needra's printer match the ransom note perfectly.	N
324	00:23:59	00:24:00	Thank you.	N
325	00:24:00	00:24:03	Thank you for coming in.	N
326	00:24:03	00:24:05	Anything I can do to help.	N
327	00:24:05	00:24:07	You know, it's, it's just terrible what happened.	N
328	00:24:08	00:24:13	Maybe you can explain why your printer was used to create the ransom note found in the Anderson home.	N
329	00:24:13	00:24:14	What?	N
330	00:24:14	00:24:17	We have evidence that this came from your printer.	N
331	00:24:17	00:24:20	There are 500 people who work in that office.	N
332	00:24:20	00:24:22	Anyone could have used my printer.	N
333	00:24:22	00:24:25	We also found a strand of hair.	N
334	00:24:25	00:24:28	Our lab has matched it to you.	N
335	00:24:28	00:24:29	From the Anderson home.	N
336	00:24:29	00:24:31	I'm Steven's secretary.I go there.	Y
337	00:24:31	00:24:34	Do you go upstairs?	Y
338	00:24:34	00:24:37	'Cause that's where we found this particular hair.	N
339	00:24:39	00:24:41	You two were having an affair.	N
340	00:24:41	00:24:43	We ended it.	Y
341	00:24:43	00:24:44	Because his wife got pregnant?	Y
342	00:24:44	00:24:46	I'm not going down this road.	N
343	00:24:46	00:24:49	What? A new baby screw up the office romance?	N
344	00:24:49	00:24:50	It was more than just an office romance, okay?	N
345	00:24:51	00:24:52	Much more.	N
346	00:24:53	00:24:58	Well, a lot of women would understand if you went over there and... got rid of that baby.	N
347	00:24:58	00:25:01	Sure. Quickest way to end a guy's marriage.	Y
348	00:25:01	00:25:03	Okay, I need a lawyer.Is that it?	N
349	00:25:03	00:25:05	Is that what you're saying here?	N
350	00:25:11	00:25:13	Are these your nylons?	N
351	00:25:13	00:25:16	I found these hidden in the back of Mr. Anderson's closet.	N
352	00:25:16	00:25:20	So, did you come to him after you disposed of the baby and ask him to hide them for you?	N
353	00:25:21	00:25:23	Talk to Steve.	N
354	00:25:26	00:25:29	Steve asked her to get out of an obligation of a newborn?	N
355	00:25:29	00:25:32	Geez, haven't these people ever heard of divorce?	N
356	00:25:35	00:25:38	Needra didn't kill Zack any more than I did.	N
357	00:25:38	00:25:41	How do you explain her hair in the baby's crib?	Y
358	00:25:47	00:25:50	We broke up the day that I learned that Gwen was pregnant with Zack.	N
359	00:25:50	00:25:54	I loved Needra but I love my family more.	N
360	00:25:54	00:26:01	Needra asked if she could see Zack, after he was born to help her kind of accept the reality.	N
361	00:26:01	00:26:06	So, I had her in last Saturday to watch him sleep.	N
362	00:26:09	00:26:11	Gwen had the kids at skating.	N
363	00:26:11	00:26:15	Needra was out of the house in 15 minutes.	N
364	00:26:17	00:26:18	You don't believe me.	N
365	00:26:18	00:26:20	You've lied to me before.	N
366	00:26:20	00:26:24	About what? You told me that you opened that cola bottle the morning you reported Zack missing.	N
367	00:26:24	00:26:26	We had a test done.	N
368	00:26:26	00:26:33	You opened that bottle six hours before you said you did-- 00 P.M.	N
369	00:26:33	00:26:34	The lab is still testing it.	N
370	00:26:34	00:26:36	I also believe that you cut it with alcohol.	N
371	00:26:36	00:26:39	Rum and cola-- what does that prove?	N
372	00:26:39	00:26:41	Was Needra Fenway in your house that night?	N
373	00:26:41	00:26:43	Did you catch her suffocating your son?	N
374	00:26:43	00:26:45	( baby crying ) What are you doing?	N
375	00:26:45	00:26:47	What have you done?	N
376	00:26:47	00:26:49	That's not how it happened.	N
377	00:26:49	00:26:52	Well, why don't you tell me how it happened.	N
378	00:26:53	00:26:55	Robbie, what did you do?	N
379	00:26:55	00:26:56	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	N
380	00:26:56	00:26:57	All right, I heard you.	N
381	00:26:57	00:27:01	Do we have to have this conversation right now?	N
382	00:27:01	00:27:02	Mr. Anderson?	N
383	00:27:02	00:27:04	What? Yeah.	N
384	00:27:04	00:27:05	I'm from the Las Vegas Post.	N
385	00:27:05	00:27:08	Comments about these pictures your secretary sold to the Midnight Informer this afternoon?	N
386	00:27:12	00:27:13	Where did you get these?	N
387	00:27:13	00:27:14	The tabloid's web site.	N
388	00:27:14	00:27:17	Needra sold them to pay for her legal fees.	N
389	00:27:22	00:27:23	Mr. Anderson?	N
390	00:27:28	00:27:32	My only comment is that I love my wife very much.	N
391	00:27:38	00:27:40	Excuse me.	N
392	00:27:40	00:27:41	I'm from the Las Vegas Post.	N
393	00:27:41	00:27:43	May I ask you a few questions?	N
394	00:27:43	00:27:44	No.	N
395	00:27:55	00:27:58	A wife kills her baby to get back at her husband over his affair.	N
396	00:27:58	00:27:59	Come on.	N
397	00:27:59	00:28:02	Any woman would go after the husband, not the baby.	Y
398	00:28:02	00:28:08	True. But in some instances women have been known to kill their children as a way to pay back a spouse.	N
399	00:28:08	00:28:14	Particularly if it's over an affair and particularly if the child was a male child.	N
400	00:28:14	00:28:16	Well I don't buy it.I just don't buy it, Doctor.	N
401	00:28:16	00:28:18	She really loved that baby.	N
402	00:28:18	00:28:21	Well, Catherine that's why she's in this much pain now.	N
403	00:28:21	00:28:24	A guy cheats, but the wife commits murder.	N
404	00:28:24	00:28:28	How come moms always end up the bad guy with you Freud types?	N
405	00:28:28	00:28:31	That's because this mother is the bad guy.	N
406	00:28:31	00:28:35	CNN just dug up a 13-year-old charge against Gwen Anderson.I heard it on the car radio.	N
407	00:28:35	00:28:36	What kind of charge?	N
408	00:28:37	00:28:39	It's called shaken baby syndrome.	N
409	00:28:39	00:28:40	The oldest boy, Tyler?	N
410	00:28:40	00:28:44	When he was a newborn she shook him so hard they had to go to the hospital.	N
411	00:28:44	00:28:46	She shook the kid unconscious.	N
412	00:28:46	00:28:48	Is this authentic?	N
413	00:28:48	00:28:52	Yeah, they were on the phone with the arresting officer from Oregon.	N
414	00:28:52	00:28:53	He faxed me this report.	N
415	00:28:53	00:28:55	Our grieving mother...her record for child abuse.	N
416	00:29:01	00:29:03	Baby killer.	N
417	00:29:11	00:29:12	You should die.You call yourself a mother?	N
418	00:29:13	00:29:14	You're the worst.	N
419	00:29:14	00:29:16	Baby killer. Someone should take those other kids from you.	N
420	00:29:17	00:29:20	Did you kill Zachary over your husband's affair?	N
421	00:29:20	00:29:21	Did you act alone or did Tyler help?	N
422	00:29:21	00:29:23	Baby killer. Bitch.	N
423	00:29:23	00:29:24	You deserve to die.Gil Grissom.	N
424	00:29:24	00:29:26	You found the baby.	N
425	00:29:26	00:29:28	How hard is it for you to look at Gwen Anderson?	N
426	00:29:28	00:29:29	Let me tell you something.	N
427	00:29:29	00:29:30	People are presumed innocent...	N
428	00:29:30	00:29:34	innocent until a court of law can examine all the evidence and prove otherwise.	N
429	00:29:34	00:29:38	Until then everything else is...	N
430	00:29:39	00:29:40	gossip.	N
431	00:29:40	00:29:44	She deserves to be put in jail.Gil Grissom. Gil Grissom!	N
432	00:29:44	00:29:46	Ice.	N
433	00:29:46	00:29:47	I don't need this.	N
434	00:29:47	00:29:48	Just do it.	N
435	00:29:51	00:29:56	That was quite a speech you made out there but between you me and the water fountain...	N
436	00:29:56	00:29:58	you think that Gwen Anderson's innocent?	N
437	00:30:00	00:30:02	What? Are you changing teams now?	N
438	00:30:02	00:30:04	You've been her biggest supporter.	N
439	00:30:04	00:30:05	I still am.	N
440	00:30:05	00:30:09	I'm just... taking your temperature.	N
441	00:30:09	00:30:12	Hey?	N
442	00:30:12	00:30:13	We're up.	N
443	00:30:15	00:30:16	You didn't answer my question.	N
444	00:30:17	00:30:19	You're right. I didn't.	N
445	00:30:21	00:30:24	I never meant to hurt Tyler, you have to understand.	N
446	00:30:24	00:30:25	You shook him unconscious.	N
447	00:30:25	00:30:27	He was choking.	N
448	00:30:27	00:30:28	All on his own?	N
449	00:30:28	00:30:31	Change your tone or I'll end this right now.	N
450	00:30:31	00:30:33	Well, it's a legitimate question.	N
451	00:30:33	00:30:36	But I have to work on my tone.You're right.	N
452	00:30:36	00:30:37	Try again.	N
453	00:30:39	00:30:40	All on his own?	N
454	00:30:42	00:30:44	Go ahead, Mrs. Anderson.	N
455	00:30:44	00:30:47	He had gotten food in his windpipe.	N
456	00:30:47	00:30:49	His face was... turning red.	N
457	00:30:49	00:30:50	Steve was at work.	N
458	00:30:50	00:31:00	So, I, I patted him on his back and-and on...and on his stomach and finally, I turned him upside down and I started shaking him to get the food out...	N
459	00:31:00	00:31:02	to... to dislodge it, and I did.	N
460	00:31:03	00:31:05	But I realized that I had hurt him, so I called 9-1-1.	N
461	00:31:05	00:31:08	She was a new mother 23 years old.	N
462	00:31:08	00:31:12	If she'd meant to harm her son why would she call 9-1-1?	Y
463	00:31:12	00:31:16	Did the E.R. find proof that there was food lodged in Tyler's throat?	Y
464	00:31:16	00:31:19	No, that's why the police were called in.	Y
465	00:31:19	00:31:25	And by the time my client went home and found the chewed food on the kitchen floor it was all too late.	Y
466	00:31:25	00:31:26	She was branded.	Y
467	00:31:26	00:31:29	It was a French fry he had grabbed from my plate.	Y
468	00:31:29	00:31:36	As for the death of little Zachary my client categorically denies any involvement.	Y
469	00:31:36	00:31:42	She's a victim of an intruder who entered her home and abducted and killed her child.	N
470	00:31:42	00:31:47	Thank you all for your continued efforts to find the real killer.	N
471	00:31:47	00:31:49	Did you know that your golf course paints its grass?	N
472	00:31:49	00:31:52	Excuse me?	N
473	00:31:52	00:31:54	It's actually a vegetable dye.	N
474	00:31:54	00:31:55	Biodegradable.	N
475	00:31:55	00:31:59	They've been using green dye on television tournaments for several years.	N
476	00:31:59	00:32:01	What's your point?	N
477	00:32:01	00:32:04	I found a pair of nylons in the back of your husband's closet.	N
478	00:32:04	00:32:10	We, uh we have a receipt that links them to your client.	N
479	00:32:10	00:32:16	The exact same dye from the golf course where Zachary was laid to rest is on your nylons.	N
480	00:32:16	00:32:19	She belongs to the club.	N
481	00:32:19	00:32:21	Grass stains.	N
482	00:32:21	00:32:23	But she doesn't play golf.	N
483	00:32:23	00:32:25	Remember our conversation, Mrs. Anderson?	N
484	00:32:26	00:32:27	It's not your game?	N
485	00:32:30	00:32:36	If you arrest her now...you have 48 hours to charge her.	N
486	00:32:36	00:32:39	You really want to show your hand at the arraignment?	N
487	00:32:42	00:32:45	We'll be in touch.	N
488	00:32:45	00:32:46	Look.	N
489	00:32:46	00:32:47	Mommy, I want my Mommy.Hey.	N
490	00:32:47	00:32:50	Can we just go, please? What's going on?	N
491	00:32:50	00:32:52	Did you see that?	N
492	00:32:52	00:32:54	A mother repelled by her young.	N
493	00:32:54	00:32:57	She didn't seem like that type to me.	N
494	00:32:57	00:33:00	All right, okay.Here, go to your brother.	N
495	00:33:00	00:33:01	I'll catch you later.	N
496	00:33:01	00:33:04	I want to hear that 9-1-1 tape.	N
497	00:33:04	00:33:05	Hi.Hey.	N
498	00:33:05	00:33:06	Grissom?	N
499	00:33:07	00:33:08	The Coroner's been trying to reach you.	N
500	00:33:08	00:33:10	Did he nail time of death?	N
501	00:33:10	00:33:12	00 P.M., but, uh, there's something else.	N
502	00:33:12	00:33:15	He isolated the fiber found in Zachary Anderson's throat.	N
503	00:33:15	00:33:18	It's a flame-retardant material-- generic name's Metaramid.	N
504	00:33:18	00:33:23	From the baby's clothes? Fire-retardant infant's clothes are made out of vinyon.	N
505	00:33:23	00:33:26	The fiber found in Zack's throat is a stronger chemical treatment.	N
506	00:33:26	00:33:28	It's found in things that are made to be near fire and flames.	N
507	00:33:30	00:33:32	Hey?	N
508	00:33:32	00:33:35	Hey, can I go with you?	N
509	00:34:08	00:34:10	Same color as the fiber in Zack's throat.	N
510	00:34:17	00:34:21	Okay, this is the 9-1-1 call 30 A.M.	N
511	00:34:21	00:34:22	Our baby has been kidnapped.	N
512	00:34:22	00:34:23	493 Fairmark.	N
513	00:34:23	00:34:24	Please hurry.	N
514	00:34:24	00:34:26	Mrs. Anderson wasn't there?	N
515	00:34:27	00:34:32	You wouldn't think so but I went ahead and separated out any underlying voices.	N
516	00:34:32	00:34:34	What are we going to do?!	N
517	00:34:34	00:34:36	She was standing, like, two meters from the phone.	N
518	00:34:36	00:34:38	Yeah, well, it's a legitimate comment.	Y
519	00:34:38	00:34:40	Doesn't make her guilty of anything.	Y
520	00:34:40	00:34:44	I know, so I checked to see if she was, like, faking her concern.	N
521	00:34:44	00:34:48	This program measures the stress level of the speakers.	N
522	00:34:48	00:34:51	Oh, God, what are we going to do?!	N
523	00:34:52	00:34:54	The stress is real.	N
524	00:34:54	00:34:56	Are you familiar with the JonBenet case?	N
525	00:34:56	00:34:59	A little.	N
526	00:34:59	00:35:06	Well, the police went back, and they found an earlier call that was placed from the home to 9-1-1 and the audio tests separated out the son's voice.	N
527	00:35:06	00:35:09	Now, I'm not saying that Tyler's our guy, but...	N
528	00:35:09	00:35:11	we need to check into every avenue.	N
529	00:35:11	00:35:19	Well, I did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the Anderson house-- from the land line, or from the cell phone.	N
530	00:35:19	00:35:23	In the parents' name, but did you look under Tyler's?	N
531	00:35:23	00:35:27	I mean, a rich kid like that's probably got a cell phone.	N
532	00:35:27	00:35:29	Yeah. All right, I'll get into it.	N
533	00:35:31	00:35:32	Hello.	N
534	00:35:32	00:35:35	Anderson attorney, 7 00 A.M.?	N
535	00:35:35	00:35:36	I'll be there.	N
536	00:35:36	00:35:37	All the evidence.	N
537	00:35:37	00:35:38	Yeah. I'll bring it all.	N
538	00:35:38	00:35:40	Thanks.	N
539	00:35:53	00:35:59	My colleagues, Messrs. Landry and Frank are representing Steve and Tyler Anderson respectively.	N
540	00:35:59	00:36:07	Although we're not co-counsel in the strictest sense we've agreed the authorities should have no more than three questions to put to our clients each.	N
541	00:36:07	00:36:10	After that, we'll accept written submissions only.	N
542	00:36:10	00:36:13	Nice... what money can buy.	N
543	00:36:13	00:36:17	My family is done being railroaded by you people so just ask your questions, and let's go.	N
544	00:36:17	00:36:19	I don't have any questions.	N
545	00:36:19	00:36:23	We know what happened in your house the night Zachary died.	N
546	00:36:23	00:36:25	We've interpreted the evidence.	N
547	00:36:25	00:36:28	All right, let's work backwards starting with the cover-up.	N
548	00:36:28	00:36:36	00 P.M.the night of the kidnapping you and Mr. Anderson had a drink-- rum and cola...	N
549	00:36:40	00:36:45	and decided what to do with the body of Zachary.	N
550	00:36:47	00:36:52	We have yet to determine whether or not his death was accidental or intentional.	N
551	00:36:52	00:36:59	The Question Documents lab thinks that a parent wrote the ransom note because there's no money amount.	Y
552	00:37:02	00:37:04	Too hard to put a price on your own son?	N
553	00:37:04	00:37:14	Mrs. Anderson, while your husband was writing the ransom note, you wrapped Zachary's body in a blanket that you got from the upstairs linen closet.	Y
554	00:37:18	00:37:22	You then laid his body to rest near a statue on the golf course.	N
555	00:37:33	00:37:37	That's how you got the grass stains on your nylons.	N
556	00:37:39	00:37:44	You put down a plastic bag from the pantry so that he'd remain dry.	N
557	00:37:44	00:37:47	Evidence of genuine care and concern.	N
558	00:37:47	00:37:51	And Mr. Anderson you put up a ladder outside the window.	N
559	00:37:51	00:37:58	The only shoe prints we found were yours and the gardener's and the gardener has been out of town.	N
560	00:37:58	00:38:10	You then drove over to your office and cranked off a ransom note on the first available printer possibly thinking that if you used a printer from outside your house we wouldn't be able to trace it.	N
561	00:38:10	00:38:11	But these three dots...	N
562	00:38:13	00:38:16	have given you away.	N
563	00:38:16	00:38:18	This may prove cover-up.	N
564	00:38:18	00:38:21	None of it proves they killed Zachary.	N
565	00:38:21	00:38:23	You're right, Counselor.	Y
566	00:38:23	00:38:26	Zachary's life was taken much earlier in the evening.	Y
567	00:38:26	00:38:29	00 P.M.	N
568	00:38:30	00:38:31	Estimated.	N
569	00:38:31	00:38:34	30.	N
570	00:38:34	00:38:36	Yes.	N
571	00:38:36	00:38:40	While Robbie and Zachary were in Tyler's care.	N
572	00:38:43	00:38:44	You said we could ask three questions each.	Y
573	00:38:45	00:38:48	Am I right? Stop.	Y
574	00:38:48	00:38:49	Ty didn't do this.	N
575	00:38:49	00:38:50	Don't give them anything.	N
576	00:38:50	00:38:52	We're already ruined.	Y
577	00:38:52	00:38:54	They're just...	Y
578	00:38:54	00:38:56	They're just trying to protect me.	N
579	00:38:56	00:38:58	Please. And I can't go on.	N
580	00:38:58	00:39:00	Mrs. Anderson. I killed him.	N
581	00:39:00	00:39:01	I came home.	N
582	00:39:03	00:39:13	Tyler h-h-hadn't put Zachary to bed because he he was crying, and I wanted to hush him up and, and I just, I went too far.	Y
583	00:39:13	00:39:18	For the record my client made this statement against legal counsel.	Y
584	00:39:18	00:39:23	Would you tell us...how you killed him.	Y
585	00:39:23	00:39:27	I smothered him with a pot holder.	N
586	00:39:27	00:39:30	And that's when Steve and I came up with the kidnap story.	N
587	00:39:33	00:39:37	It was the longest night of our lives.	N
588	00:39:37	00:39:41	You had to wait till the morning to report him missing.	N
589	00:39:41	00:39:43	So that it wouldn't look suspicious.	Y
590	00:39:45	00:39:48	And you may not believe me, but I loved him.	Y
591	00:39:48	00:39:50	I loved him very, very much.	N
592	00:39:54	00:39:57	We're going to have to have them both arrested.	N
593	00:40:11	00:40:12	I'm just coming to meet you guys.	N
594	00:40:12	00:40:14	I thought you were at the Andersons.	N
595	00:40:14	00:40:15	She copped.	N
596	00:40:15	00:40:19	Guilty people do that when you corner them with evidence.	N
597	00:40:19	00:40:21	Guys, the mother didn't do it.	N
598	00:40:21	00:40:23	What?	N
599	00:40:23	00:40:24	Listen.	N
600	00:40:29	00:40:33	What did you do, Robbie?!	N
601	00:40:33	00:40:35	What did you do?!	Y
602	00:40:36	00:40:39	I was watching the boys.	N
603	00:40:39	00:40:42	I had my eye on them; I did.	Y
604	00:40:46	00:40:51	Yeah. But then you called your girlfriend.	Y
605	00:40:51	00:40:53	And we got to talking.	N
606	00:40:55	00:40:59	And I was kind of ignoring Zack and Robbie.	Y
607	00:41:00	00:41:03	They were being quiet.	N
608	00:41:03	00:41:05	They were behaving.	N
609	00:41:05	00:41:09	I turned around, and I saw how still he was.	Y
610	00:41:11	00:41:14	I ran to him, and he was dead.	N
611	00:41:16	00:41:19	And that's when you called 9-1-1.	N
612	00:41:26	00:41:31	But you must have dropped the phone to tend to Zack.	N
613	00:41:35	00:41:38	What did you do, Robbie?!	N
614	00:41:38	00:41:39	What did you do?!	N
615	00:41:39	00:41:44	Then I guess somehow in the chaos you got disconnected.	N
616	00:41:46	00:41:49	Soon after that, your parents arrived.	Y
617	00:41:51	00:41:52	Oh, my God.	Y
618	00:41:53	00:41:55	What happened?	Y
619	00:41:55	00:41:59	One of you worked on him so hard that you cracked his sternum.	N
620	00:42:01	00:42:03	He was already blue.	N
621	00:42:06	00:42:08	I pushed.	N
622	00:42:08	00:42:13	I tried to breathe air into him, but he was gone.	N
623	00:42:13	00:42:15	We did everything that we could.	N
624	00:42:15	00:42:18	Why didn't you just tell the truth?	N
625	00:42:18	00:42:20	We wanted to protect Robbie.	N
626	00:42:25	00:42:28	We didn't want him to grow up with the stigma of...	N
627	00:42:28	00:42:32	the boy who killed his brother.	Y
628	00:42:34	00:42:35	He's three.	N
629	00:42:35	00:42:37	He's clinically unaware of his actions.	N
630	00:42:37	00:42:40	No court would hold him accountable for that.	N
631	00:42:40	00:42:43	But everybody else would know.	N
632	00:42:43	00:42:46	It would follow him the rest of his life.	Y
633	00:42:46	00:42:56	And my wife...would rather go to prison than to have anybody know what Robbie did.	N
634	00:42:57	00:43:00	Mr. Anderson, we won't let that happen.	N
635	00:43:24	00:43:31	Now I know why you didn't want to hold Robbie when your older son handed him to you outside the police department.	N
636	00:43:35	00:43:37	I'm very sorry.	N
637	00:43:39	00:43:41	I always, uh...	N
638	00:43:41	00:43:45	I always tell them, Gentle, gentle.	N
639	00:43:47	00:43:48	He didn't mean it.	N
640	00:43:48	00:43:49	I know he didn't mean it.	N
641	00:43:50	00:43:51	Of course he didn't.	N
642	00:44:04	00:44:07	You must think that we're awful people-- all the stuff that's come out.	N
643	00:44:08	00:44:14	You're an average family burdened with a tragedy that put you under a microscope.	N
644	00:44:14	00:44:17	That close, nobody can look good.	N
645	00:44:26	00:44:29	Your family's waiting for you.	N
646	00:44:29	00:44:31	You ready?	N
