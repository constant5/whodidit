0	00:00:10	00:00:12	I'm going to make this really simple.	N
1	00:00:12	00:00:14	Who are you workin' with?	N
2	00:00:14	00:00:17	I'm, uh, unemployed at the moment.	N
3	00:00:17	00:00:20	You got any idea what we did to chumps like you back in the day?	N
4	00:00:22	00:00:23	Uh, no.	N
5	00:00:23	00:00:27	Look, could you put the A.C. on in here or somethin'?	N
6	00:00:27	00:00:30	That, or just, uh, let me go.	N
7	00:00:30	00:00:31	I mean, you can't keep me in here.	N
8	00:00:32	00:00:33	It's against the law.	N
9	00:00:33	00:00:36	There's no law in this room.	N
10	00:00:40	00:00:42	You can't touch me.	N
11	00:00:45	00:00:48	Two shots to the back of the head.	N
12	00:00:48	00:00:50	Double tap.	N
13	00:00:55	00:00:58	He's wearing a wig and a fat suit.	N
14	00:00:58	00:01:00	It's not Halloween, is it?	N
15	00:01:00	00:01:02	In this town, it's always Halloween.	N
16	00:01:05	00:01:06	Ernie Menlo.	N
17	00:01:06	00:01:10	Well, he wasn't carrying a very fat wad.	N
18	00:01:10	00:01:12	Rolex is still on his wrist.	N
19	00:01:12	00:01:14	Probably rules out robbery.	N
20	00:01:14	00:01:16	What do you think?	N
21	00:01:16	00:01:17	I don't know.	N
22	00:01:22	00:01:24	I'm looking for a sign.	N
23	00:01:56	00:01:57	He's not in the system?	N
24	00:01:57	00:01:59	Yeah... gotta be.	N
25	00:01:59	00:02:01	Okay. Thanks.	N
26	00:02:03	00:02:04	So, uh...	N
27	00:02:04	00:02:06	Brass ran the ID.	N
28	00:02:06	00:02:08	There's no Ernie Menlo in the system.	N
29	00:02:08	00:02:10	Fake.	N
30	00:02:10	00:02:12	GSR in the wound track.	N
31	00:02:12	00:02:15	No stellate tearing.	N
32	00:02:15	00:02:20	Gunshots appear to be close range, but noncontact.	N
33	00:02:23	00:02:25	No exit wounds.	Y
34	00:02:25	00:02:29	Well, I don't see any shell casings either.	N
35	00:02:29	00:02:33	So maybe the killer picked them up.	N
36	00:02:33	00:02:34	Professional hit?	N
37	00:02:36	00:02:40	Major fractures and lacerations on his hands.	N
38	00:02:40	00:02:41	Lividity's consistent with body position.	N
39	00:02:41	00:02:43	I don't think it was a body dump.	N
40	00:02:43	00:02:45	So either he walked in or he got a ride.	N
41	00:02:46	00:02:49	Either way, this gravel and glass makes good evidence.	N
42	00:02:50	00:02:52	I'll go ahead and bag a sample.	N
43	00:03:37	00:03:41	Rampart Casino.	N
44	00:03:41	00:03:42	Well, his day started out good.	N
45	00:03:42	00:03:46	He won $436,278.	N
46	00:03:46	00:03:49	Rampart's always been lucky for me.	N
47	00:03:49	00:03:51	So where is this money?	N
48	00:04:00	00:04:02	I found some tire treads.	N
49	00:04:02	00:04:04	I think the vehicle was making a three-point turn.	N
50	00:04:04	00:04:08	And it seems that robbery may be a motive after all.	N
51	00:04:10	00:04:12	Wow!	N
52	00:04:12	00:04:13	Rampart.	N
53	00:04:13	00:04:16	Guess I'll go check that out.	N
54	00:04:16	00:04:17	You can't.	N
55	00:04:17	00:04:22	We found the body under the Whiskey Town sign and the guy just cleaned out the Rampart Casino.	N
56	00:04:22	00:04:24	Coincidence.	N
57	00:04:24	00:04:26	Even if it is, they're still Sam Braun's casinos.	N
58	00:04:26	00:04:28	Why is that a problem?	N
59	00:04:28	00:04:29	He's your father.	N
60	00:04:29	00:04:31	You can't be on this case.	N
61	00:04:31	00:04:35	Gil... Catherine, you have to go home.	N
62	00:05:21	00:05:22	No ticks. It's authentic.	N
63	00:05:26	00:05:28	Logo sticker isn't worn down.	N
64	00:05:28	00:05:29	Watch could be new.	N
65	00:05:29	00:05:31	Guy hits the jackpot, has to celebrate.	N
66	00:05:31	00:05:35	Goes and buys some bling-bling to impress the strippers with.	N
67	00:05:36	00:05:37	What have you got?	N
68	00:05:39	00:05:41	Air conditioned socks.	N
69	00:05:46	00:05:47	Insurance?	N
70	00:05:51	00:05:54	Dealer wins.	N
71	00:05:54	00:05:55	Seven!	N
72	00:06:03	00:06:06	24 is even.	N
73	00:06:14	00:06:18	So, I talked to the pit boss who signed the vic's W-2.	N
74	00:06:18	00:06:19	He was pulling surveillance.	N
75	00:06:19	00:06:21	He remembers the big winner.	N
76	00:06:23	00:06:25	Sam Braun!	N
77	00:06:25	00:06:26	What a surprise!	N
78	00:06:28	00:06:31	The fat kid... he was cheating.	N
79	00:06:31	00:06:33	What do you do about it?	N
80	00:06:33	00:06:34	Well, we had a little chat.	N
81	00:06:34	00:06:36	I didn't kill him.	N
82	00:06:36	00:06:37	Did you take him to the box?	N
83	00:06:37	00:06:40	Gentlemen, these days, we call it the holding room.	N
84	00:06:49	00:06:52	Smells like the cleaning crew just left.	N
85	00:07:02	00:07:07	Security brought the kid 00 a.m.	N
86	00:07:07	00:07:08	I came in.	N
87	00:07:08	00:07:10	We talked.	N
88	00:07:10	00:07:12	00.	N
89	00:07:15	00:07:17	It's all in there.	N
90	00:07:17	00:07:18	Well, good.	N
91	00:07:18	00:07:20	We'll look at the tapes a little later.	N
92	00:07:20	00:07:22	Would you turn off the lights, please?	N
93	00:07:27	00:07:31	It's well within my rights to have a discussion with anyone in my place.	N
94	00:07:31	00:07:34	The kid was cheating.	N
95	00:07:34	00:07:36	I wanted to know how.	N
96	00:07:36	00:07:39	Nobody wins 400K at roulette.	N
97	00:07:39	00:07:41	What's your system?	N
98	00:07:41	00:07:44	Clean living... good karma.	N
99	00:07:44	00:07:47	But either you call the cops and book me now, or I'm out of here.	N
100	00:07:47	00:07:50	You're no longer welcome at the Rampart.	N
101	00:07:50	00:07:52	Awesome.	N
102	00:07:52	00:07:55	Okay, I'll take my money and go.	N
103	00:07:55	00:08:00	Do you have any idea the house advantage in roulette?	N
104	00:08:00	00:08:07	5.26% Albert Einstein had a theory about roulette.	N
105	00:08:07	00:08:11	He said the only way to win at roulette is to steal the money from the table when the croupier isn't looking.	N
106	00:08:11	00:08:14	There's always someone looking.	N
107	00:08:18	00:08:21	Well, maybe it was an inside job, Sam.	N
108	00:08:21	00:08:24	Maybe somebody bought off one of your guys.	N
109	00:08:25	00:08:27	I'm curious.	N
110	00:08:27	00:08:29	What bothers you more?	N
111	00:08:29	00:08:34	The fact that you couldn't pin a murder on me or that Catherine cashed my check?	N
112	00:08:39	00:08:41	There were no strings on that money.	N
113	00:08:43	00:08:47	Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.	N
114	00:08:47	00:08:50	Believe whatever you like.	N
115	00:08:50	00:08:53	That kid walked out of here with my money.	N
116	00:08:53	00:08:58	If you figure out how he ripped me off, would you let me know?	N
117	00:09:02	00:09:05	For what it's worth, these bruises correspond to the holes in his sock.	N
118	00:09:05	00:09:08	Well, he's been worked over pretty good.	N
119	00:09:08	00:09:10	He's got a nice fat lip.	N
120	00:09:10	00:09:12	Yeah.	N
121	00:09:12	00:09:16	There was a good clot in the wound, and the tissues were contused.	N
122	00:09:16	00:09:19	I'd say it occurred at least an hour or two before death.	N
123	00:09:20	00:09:26	I teased out a couple of small- caliber projectiles from his brain.	N
124	00:09:26	00:09:30	One was embedded in the right frontal cortex.	N
125	00:09:30	00:09:33	The other lodged in the first cervical vertebra.	N
126	00:09:33	00:09:35	It's copper-washed lead.	N
127	00:09:35	00:09:37	Must be a .22.	N
128	00:09:37	00:09:41	You know, historically, .22s were the hit man's bullet of choice.	N
129	00:09:41	00:09:48	They have the energy to enter into the cranial vault, but not enough to exit, so they just ricochet around inside, shredding the gray matter until they stop.	N
130	00:09:49	00:09:50	Nice.	N
131	00:09:50	00:09:57	There's also extensive crush injury to both hands, with fractures of the metacarpals and the phalanges.	N
132	00:09:57	00:09:59	Bruises appear perimortem.	N
133	00:09:59	00:10:02	Any idea what might have caused that kind of damage?	N
134	00:10:02	00:10:06	Given the fracture pattern, I'd guess it was some sort of blunt object.	N
135	00:10:06	00:10:09	Maybe a ball peen hammer.	N
136	00:10:09	00:10:10	What gets you to that?	N
137	00:10:10	00:10:16	They used to tell me back in the days, the first time you got caught cheating, they'd give you a couple whacks on the hand with a ball peen hammer.	N
138	00:10:16	00:10:18	Ow.	N
139	00:10:18	00:10:19	The second time, you'd lose a limb.	N
140	00:10:19	00:10:21	Third time?	N
141	00:10:21	00:10:24	A long walk in the desert with a shovel.	N
142	00:11:00	00:11:01	A computer in his shoe.	N
143	00:11:01	00:11:04	As far as I could tell, it's a wireless receiver.	N
144	00:11:04	00:11:10	It picks up a signal, solenoids drive the points up against the guy's foot, tells him what number to bet.	N
145	00:11:10	00:11:11	Based on what?	N
146	00:11:11	00:11:12	I don't know.	N
147	00:11:12	00:11:13	Archie's working on it right now.	Y
148	00:11:13	00:11:17	Well, if our vic was the receiver, there has to be a transmitter.	Y
149	00:11:17	00:11:18	Hey, I got an ID on our vic.	N
150	00:11:18	00:11:19	A Teddy Keller.	N
151	00:11:19	00:11:23	Everyone who buys a Rolex gets registered at the point of purchase.	Y
152	00:11:23	00:11:24	So I ran the serial number.	Y
153	00:11:24	00:11:27	He bought the watch at the Forum Shops two days ago.	N
154	00:11:27	00:11:29	And I got his home address.	N
155	00:11:29	00:11:33	Well, his driver's license was fake, so, this could be fake, too.	N
156	00:11:34	00:11:35	A fake ID is for scamming a casino.	Y
157	00:11:35	00:11:38	A baller puts his real name on a Roley.	Y
158	00:11:38	00:11:40	What? He rubs off.	Y
159	00:11:42	00:11:44	Teddy Keller.	Y
160	00:11:44	00:11:46	That's Apartment 27.	Y
161	00:11:46	00:11:48	Is he in some kind of trouble?	N
162	00:11:48	00:11:50	Hey, John. Hey, Mr. Green.	Y
163	00:11:50	00:11:52	When was the last time you saw him?	N
164	00:11:52	00:11:53	I don't know.	N
165	00:11:53	00:11:55	He's got a roommate-- Davis Mullens.	N
166	00:11:55	00:11:59	Oh, yeah, they eat a tremendous amount of pizza.	N
167	00:11:59	00:12:02	Tremendous amount of pizza and calzone.	N
168	00:12:02	00:12:07	I feel like bopping that delivery guy every time he buzzes the gate.	N
169	00:12:07	00:12:08	Here we are.	N
170	00:12:11	00:12:13	Anybody home?	N
171	00:12:14	00:12:16	Hello?	N
172	00:12:16	00:12:19	I guess the roommate's out, huh?	N
173	00:12:27	00:12:29	It's freezing in here.	N
174	00:12:32	00:12:35	Get a load of this wheel.	N
175	00:12:36	00:12:39	It's regulation.	N
176	00:12:39	00:12:41	These things run about 1,500 bucks.	N
177	00:12:41	00:12:44	Well, they cleared almost half a mil.	N
178	00:12:44	00:12:46	It's a good investment.	N
179	00:12:46	00:12:48	Yeah.	N
180	00:12:56	00:12:59	These guys definitely had a system.	N
181	00:13:01	00:13:03	Hey, Rick, you might want to check this out.	N
182	00:13:13	00:13:15	Looks like the roommate's home after all.	N
183	00:13:20	00:13:21	Two taps to the head.	Y
184	00:13:23	00:13:25	Deja vu.	N
185	00:13:34	00:13:36	These guys liked to play dress-up.	N
186	00:13:36	00:13:38	You find any shoes back there?	N
187	00:13:43	00:13:44	I'm looking.	N
188	00:13:49	00:13:50	Blood smear here.	N
189	00:13:54	00:13:55	Maybe the killer tried to clean up.	N
190	00:13:56	00:13:57	That's ridiculous.	N
191	00:13:57	00:13:59	Why bother?	N
192	00:13:59	00:14:00	Okay.	N
193	00:14:00	00:14:04	Have a distinctive white mark on his right shoulder.	N
194	00:14:06	00:14:08	What do you make of that?	N
195	00:14:08	00:14:10	You already shot me down once.	N
196	00:14:10	00:14:13	Look, uh, it could be right.	N
197	00:14:13	00:14:14	Thanks.	N
198	00:14:14	00:14:16	Can you make sure that gets to Trace?	N
199	00:14:16	00:14:18	Yeah. Sure.	N
200	00:14:22	00:14:24	Hey, what're you doing, touching that?	N
201	00:14:24	00:14:25	You got gloves?	N
202	00:14:25	00:14:28	Relax. I got it covered.	N
203	00:14:28	00:14:32	Hey, Rick, remember the time you said you could get a print off of air?	N
204	00:14:32	00:14:33	Yeah.	N
205	00:15:12	00:15:14	So you just got the day off?	N
206	00:15:14	00:15:16	Just... Just like that?	N
207	00:15:16	00:15:17	Are you complaining?	N
208	00:15:17	00:15:18	No.	N
209	00:15:18	00:15:23	You just seem a little pissed off about it.	N
210	00:15:23	00:15:25	I like it.	N
211	00:15:26	00:15:27	You like that?	N
212	00:15:29	00:15:31	Depends on what you're gonna do with it.	N
213	00:15:32	00:15:35	Pretty expensive taste for a public servant.	N
214	00:15:35	00:15:37	She can afford it.	N
215	00:15:38	00:15:40	You going to introduce him?	N
216	00:15:40	00:15:41	Mr. Braun.	N
217	00:15:41	00:15:43	Chris Bezich.	N
218	00:15:43	00:15:44	It's a pleasure to meet you.	N
219	00:15:44	00:15:47	Your hosts, send a lot of your whales to my club, Acid Drop.	N
220	00:15:47	00:15:49	That's great.	N
221	00:15:49	00:15:51	Just give us a minute.	N
222	00:15:51	00:15:53	Okay.	N
223	00:15:53	00:15:54	What do you want?	N
224	00:15:54	00:15:57	Mugs, I heard you had some time off because of me.	N
225	00:15:57	00:16:00	I could get fired for even having this conversation. Relax.	N
226	00:16:00	00:16:01	Vegas is a small town.	N
227	00:16:01	00:16:03	I'm always running into people I know.	N
228	00:16:03	00:16:05	Just cut to the chase, Sam.	N
229	00:16:05	00:16:09	Some people in this town think I'm a murderer.	N
230	00:16:09	00:16:11	Some people in this town know you're a murderer.	N
231	00:16:12	00:16:13	I did not kill those kids.	N
232	00:16:13	00:16:14	I did not! Kids?	N
233	00:16:14	00:16:16	How do you know there's more than one?	N
234	00:16:16	00:16:17	Cath...	N
235	00:16:17	00:16:19	I'm fine.	N
236	00:16:19	00:16:21	You're not impressing her.	N
237	00:16:22	00:16:24	I'll be in touch.	N
238	00:16:44	00:16:46	You and Sam Braun...	N
239	00:16:46	00:16:49	He slept with my mother.	N
240	00:16:49	00:16:53	The glass fragments you found at the apartment building are primarily lead-based.	N
241	00:16:53	00:16:58	Different curvatures and textures with traces of florescent powder, phosphorus and mercury.	N
242	00:16:58	00:16:59	Neon glass.	N
243	00:16:59	00:17:01	I checked out that graveyard once.	N
244	00:17:01	00:17:03	Pretty interesting.	N
245	00:17:03	00:17:05	The comparison?	N
246	00:17:05	00:17:08	Your sample's consistent with the glass collected from the first crime scene.	N
247	00:17:08	00:17:09	See?	N
248	00:17:09	00:17:10	That connects the two murders.	N
249	00:17:10	00:17:13	We've got a timeline.	N
250	00:17:14	00:17:15	Hey.	N
251	00:17:15	00:17:16	Hey.	N
252	00:17:21	00:17:22	Everything okay?	N
253	00:17:23	00:17:25	This is about the key CSI position.	N
254	00:17:25	00:17:26	Grissom recommended me.	N
255	00:17:28	00:17:30	Congratulations.	N
256	00:17:30	00:17:33	It's not necessary.	N
257	00:17:33	00:17:34	Position was cut.	N
258	00:17:34	00:17:40	Budget had room for the new promotion or a new Qiagen, Bio Robot EZ-1.	N
259	00:17:40	00:17:42	Greg will be thrilled.	N
260	00:17:42	00:17:44	Yeah.	N
261	00:17:45	00:17:48	Oh, well, it's just an honor to be nominated, right?	N
262	00:17:51	00:17:55	Grissom, I have been in Vegas my whole life.	N
263	00:17:55	00:18:02	I've known guys who counted cards, hedged bets, crushed a poker table with a lowball pair.	N
264	00:18:02	00:18:04	I've seen guys beat the house with their hands...	N
265	00:18:04	00:18:07	but never with their toes.	N
266	00:18:08	00:18:12	Transmitter and receiver.	N
267	00:18:12	00:18:17	I was reading about these Silicon Valley types in the '80s called the... Eudaemonic Enterprises.	N
268	00:18:17	00:18:19	Have you heard of them?	N
269	00:18:19	00:18:20	The Eudaemon.	N
270	00:18:20	00:18:24	Aristotle's presiding spirit of rationality.	N
271	00:18:24	00:18:27	They say they figured out a way to beat the roulette wheel.	N
272	00:18:27	00:18:30	Not through a betting system, but through physics.	N
273	00:18:30	00:18:33	It's simple in principle.	N
274	00:18:33	00:18:35	A fixed mass in a known orbit.	N
275	00:18:35	00:18:42	As long as you can account for all the forces-- air resistance, friction, gravity-- you can land a probe on Mars.	N
276	00:18:42	00:18:45	Every roulette wheel is a little different.	N
277	00:18:45	00:18:47	Tilt, wobble, bounce...	N
278	00:18:47	00:18:57	The guy with the transmitter does the calibration, clocks the position of the ball, hits the switch...	N
279	00:18:57	00:18:59	and the computer does the rest.	N
280	00:18:59	00:19:06	Plays out the spin in milliseconds, Predicts the result, then transmits a code to the receiver about where that ball will land.	N
281	00:19:06	00:19:08	All right, big money, big money!	N
282	00:19:08	00:19:10	$1,000 on four, 22, five and 17.	N
283	00:19:10	00:19:13	It's number 22.	N
284	00:19:16	00:19:19	This setup gives you a 44-percent advantage over the house.	N
285	00:19:19	00:19:25	For every hundred these guys bet, they're pulling in $2,200 an hour.	N
286	00:19:25	00:19:26	Nice return.	N
287	00:19:26	00:19:28	But it's a complicated system.	N
288	00:19:28	00:19:29	Complicated, huh?	N
289	00:19:30	00:19:31	Maybe for a couple of pizza majors.	N
290	00:19:31	00:19:34	But not for an electrical engineering grad student.	N
291	00:19:34	00:19:38	AFIS got a hit on the print off the transmitter in the shoe.	N
292	00:19:38	00:19:41	Seth Landers. WLVU.	N
293	00:19:41	00:19:44	Got busted a few years ago for making fake IDs.	N
294	00:19:48	00:19:50	Seth Landers doesn't have a roommate.	N
295	00:19:51	00:19:52	No answer at his door.	N
296	00:19:52	00:19:54	Guy's in the wind.	N
297	00:19:54	00:19:57	If someone hit my boys all mob-style I'd disappear, too, you know?	N
298	00:19:57	00:20:00	Yeah, I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way.	N
299	00:20:00	00:20:02	I'll put out a broadcast.	N
300	00:20:02	00:20:03	Wait a minute.	N
301	00:20:03	00:20:04	Hey, kid...	N
302	00:20:04	00:20:05	you know Seth Landers?	N
303	00:20:07	00:20:09	Uh-oh.	N
304	00:20:14	00:20:15	Stop!	N
305	00:20:20	00:20:21	Don't kill me! Don't kill me!	N
306	00:20:21	00:20:24	Please! I'll do whatever Mr. Braun wants!	N
307	00:20:24	00:20:25	Please don't kill me! Please! Las Vegas Police.	N
308	00:20:25	00:20:27	You Seth Landers? Yeah.	N
309	00:20:27	00:20:28	Seth Landers? Yes!	N
310	00:20:28	00:20:29	Let's go.	N
311	00:20:33	00:20:37	Jacking Sam Braun's casino at roulette-- that was gutsy... and smart.	N
312	00:20:38	00:20:43	And since you weren't the one placing the bet, I guess that makes you the smart one.	N
313	00:20:43	00:20:49	Your boys right here-- Teddy and Davis, the candid camera.	N
314	00:20:49	00:20:51	They came to me. It was their idea.	N
315	00:20:51	00:20:57	Judging from what we found in your apartment, looks like you made their idea work.	N
316	00:20:57	00:20:59	I built the computers to put in the shoes.	N
317	00:20:59	00:21:00	That's all.	N
318	00:21:00	00:21:03	Your partners cleared half a mil on your skills.	N
319	00:21:03	00:21:06	Dollar signs get involved, things get ugly, huh?	N
320	00:21:06	00:21:09	Scam was 20 to 30K a night, max.	N
321	00:21:09	00:21:11	We hit Pike's. Next day, Tangiers.	N
322	00:21:11	00:21:13	Everything was great.	N
323	00:21:13	00:21:18	We made 50 grand, and then Teddy and Davis got greedy.	N
324	00:21:18	00:21:23	You can't crush a roulette table like that, and not expect someone to notice.	N
325	00:21:23	00:21:25	The Tangiers, Pike's, Rampart...	N
326	00:21:25	00:21:27	these are all Sam Braun's places.	N
327	00:21:27	00:21:29	You got something against him?	N
328	00:21:29	00:21:30	No.	N
329	00:21:30	00:21:32	His casinos are old school.	N
330	00:21:32	00:21:33	They're low tech.	N
331	00:21:33	00:21:36	There's less interference for my gear.	N
332	00:21:36	00:21:37	Your gear...	N
333	00:21:39	00:21:41	What was your cut?	N
334	00:21:41	00:21:44	I didn't get one. I just got paid for my supplies and my time. That's all.	N
335	00:21:44	00:21:46	Yeah, picture that!	N
336	00:21:46	00:21:49	It was a challenge. I just wanted to see if I could make it work.	N
337	00:21:49	00:21:51	Any idea where the money is?	N
338	00:21:51	00:21:53	Why don't you ask Sam Braun?	N
339	00:21:56	00:22:00	When they took Teddy to the box, I was sure we were busted.	N
340	00:22:00	00:22:03	Davis freaked. He split.	N
341	00:22:03	00:22:08	And then when he came out with the money, everything was great.	N
342	00:22:08	00:22:11	For about two seconds.	N
343	00:22:11	00:22:15	They grabbed him and led him outside.	N
344	00:22:15	00:22:18	That was the last time I saw either one of them.	N
345	00:22:26	00:22:28	What are you doing?	N
346	00:22:28	00:22:31	I'm testing my podiatric dexterity.	N
347	00:22:31	00:22:33	What are you doing?	N
348	00:22:33	00:22:36	Uh, you know those tracks that we found at the neon graveyard?	N
349	00:22:36	00:22:39	The ones from the case you're not working on?	N
350	00:22:39	00:22:41	Yeah, those.	N
351	00:22:41	00:22:43	Sam...	N
352	00:22:43	00:22:45	used to be a Caddy man.	N
353	00:22:45	00:22:47	He would drive a new one every year.	N
354	00:22:47	00:22:49	These days, he's being driven.	N
355	00:22:49	00:22:51	And you know this because...?	N
356	00:22:51	00:22:52	I saw him.	N
357	00:22:52	00:22:54	He came to me.	N
358	00:22:54	00:22:55	And you walked away, I hope.	N
359	00:22:55	00:22:57	I made him walk away from me.	N
360	00:22:57	00:23:01	Right into a stretch limo with a big turning radius.	N
361	00:23:01	00:23:02	That doesn't prove anything.	N
362	00:23:02	00:23:05	Besides, any evidence that comes from you is tainted.	N
363	00:23:06	00:23:07	Then have it come from you.	N
364	00:23:07	00:23:09	Warrant shouldn't be hard to get.	N
365	00:23:09	00:23:13	Especially if the call comes from someone whose character is above reproach.	N
366	00:23:30	00:23:32	Nick said the budget for the promotion was cut.	N
367	00:23:32	00:23:35	240 inches-- 20 feet.	N
368	00:23:35	00:23:37	He also said you recommended him.	N
369	00:23:41	00:23:43	I did.	N
370	00:23:50	00:23:53	Possible neon glass fragment.	N
371	00:24:20	00:24:22	You said you didn't have a problem with me.	N
372	00:24:23	00:24:25	I don't.	N
373	00:24:26	00:24:31	I thought that Nick was the best candidate for the position.	N
374	00:24:33	00:24:35	Why?	N
375	00:24:36	00:24:40	Because he didn't care whether he got the job or not.	N
376	00:24:40	00:24:43	That's a stupid reason.	N
377	00:24:50	00:24:52	We've got blood.	N
378	00:24:58	00:25:00	Handle your scandal.	N
379	00:25:04	00:25:06	Sam Braun?	N
380	00:25:06	00:25:09	You're under arrest for the murder of Teddy Keller.	N
381	00:25:09	00:25:11	Is this some kind of joke?	N
382	00:25:11	00:25:13	I'm not laughing.	N
383	00:25:15	00:25:19	Call my lawyer. This won't take long.	N
384	00:25:20	00:25:20	Sam?	N
385	00:25:22	00:25:24	I'm parked out front.	N
386	00:25:43	00:25:48	As much as my client appreciates your flair for the dramatic, the show's over, gentlemen.	N
387	00:25:48	00:25:50	What do you have?	N
388	00:25:50	00:25:56	The tire patterns at the scene of Teddy Keller's murder are consistent with the wheel base and turning radius of your client's limousine.	N
389	00:25:56	00:26:00	As well as every other limo in Vegas.	N
390	00:26:00	00:26:03	We also found neon glass embedded in all four tires.	N
391	00:26:03	00:26:04	The whole town's a construction site.	N
392	00:26:05	00:26:06	It's a tenuous link, at best.	N
393	00:26:06	00:26:12	Well, then... how did his blood end up in the back of your client's limousine?	N
394	00:26:13	00:26:17	You waited until Teddy cleared the security cameras...	N
395	00:26:22	00:26:24	We're not through talking, kid.	N
396	00:26:24	00:26:26	And then you took him for a ride...	N
397	00:26:26	00:26:27	Vegas style.	N
398	00:26:27	00:26:30	Just like the old days.	N
399	00:26:39	00:26:42	Let me show you what I do to cheaters.	N
400	00:26:43	00:26:46	No, no!	N
401	00:26:54	00:26:56	My client offered the young man a ride home.	N
402	00:26:56	00:27:03	They stopped briefly at the neon graveyard, where they held a private conversation regarding the ethics of defrauding a casino.	N
403	00:27:04	00:27:07	That must have been some chat.	N
404	00:27:07	00:27:09	We know he left the casino with the money.	N
405	00:27:09	00:27:14	The young man returned the money as a sign of respect for my client and his position in the community.	N
406	00:27:14	00:27:16	I'm sure he did.	N
407	00:27:16	00:27:18	So, what next?	N
408	00:27:18	00:27:20	You gonna tell me you're being set up?	N
409	00:27:20	00:27:23	It happens to you a lot, huh, Sam?	N
410	00:28:16	00:28:24	Your smudge from that second kid's shirt-- I got a spectral library match to Sherwin-Williams EverClean interior paint, Navajo White.	Y
411	00:28:26	00:28:28	Anything distinctive? I would have mentioned it.	Y
412	00:28:28	00:28:30	Sometimes a paint sample's just a paint sample.	N
413	00:28:30	00:28:31	Yeah.	Y
414	00:28:31	00:28:33	You still liking Braun for these murders?	Y
415	00:28:33	00:28:35	Yeah, why? Something change?	Y
416	00:28:35	00:28:38	I'm thinking Seth Landers and his pals had a woody for him.	Y
417	00:28:38	00:28:43	I went back to the Rampart, and I took some electronic noise measurements.	Y
418	00:28:43	00:28:46	The place is a mess of interference.	Y
419	00:28:46	00:28:48	Electronics in old casinos aren't shielded.	N
420	00:28:48	00:28:53	So, you're saying that the shoe computers would've worked better in one of the new casinos on the Strip?	Y
421	00:28:53	00:28:58	Definitely. A kid as smart as Seth wouldn't make a mistake like that.	Y
422	00:28:58	00:29:00	Then it was intentional.	Y
423	00:29:01	00:29:03	Maybe personal.	Y
424	00:29:45	00:29:47	So, this is your casino of choice?	Y
425	00:29:47	00:29:49	That's what your tenants said.	Y
426	00:29:49	00:29:51	Sir, could you tell us about Seth Landers?	Y
427	00:29:51	00:29:54	That's my son. Is he okay?	Y
428	00:29:55	00:29:59	Let's stop playing dumb, Mr. Greene, huh?	Y
429	00:29:59	00:30:01	Would you mind stepping away from the machine?	Y
430	00:30:01	00:30:04	You're staring over my shoulder, you're looking at me.	Y
431	00:30:04	00:30:05	You're jinxing me, and I'm gonna have to...	Y
432	00:30:05	00:30:07	How's that? Is that better?	Y
433	00:30:09	00:30:11	What happened to your hand?	Y
434	00:30:11	00:30:14	I had an accident a long time ago.	Y
435	00:30:14	00:30:15	Sam Braun do that with a hammer?	Y
436	00:30:16	00:30:17	I'm sorry, I don't know who that person is.	N
437	00:30:17	00:30:19	Who is that?	Y
438	00:30:19	00:30:21	I don't like to talk about my hand, okay?	Y
439	00:30:21	00:30:22	Well, that's too bad.	Y
440	00:30:22	00:30:24	'Cause you know what?	Y
441	00:30:24	00:30:28	Today... this is your life.	N
442	00:31:04	00:31:08	Joe Greene-- AKA Joe Landers.	Y
443	00:31:08	00:31:10	They're old friends.	Y
444	00:31:12	00:31:14	Sorry to break up the reunion, fellas.	N
445	00:31:14	00:31:16	Mr. Greene... Mr. Landers...	N
446	00:31:16	00:31:18	Which is it? It's Greene.	N
447	00:31:18	00:31:20	Come with me.	N
448	00:31:21	00:31:24	Do your hands hurt when it rains, Joe?	Y
449	00:31:26	00:31:29	Do I know you?	Y
450	00:31:38	00:31:41	The exclusion/exemption clause means you don't get to gamble.	N
451	00:31:41	00:31:42	Period.	N
452	00:31:42	00:31:44	Not even the quarter slots at the Gas-and-Go.	N
453	00:31:44	00:31:48	Don't you have something better to do?	Y
454	00:31:48	00:31:52	Like find out who murdered those two kids in number 27.	Y
455	00:31:52	00:31:53	You got any theories?	N
456	00:31:53	00:31:55	It was your apartment building.	N
457	00:31:55	00:31:58	Your son Seth fingered the guy you were sitting next to.	N
458	00:31:58	00:31:59	A guy you don't know.	N
459	00:31:59	00:32:01	The guy who put you in the Black Book.	N
460	00:32:01	00:32:06	No. The Gaming Commission put me in the Black Book.	N
461	00:32:06	00:32:07	Yeah, for cheating, Joe.	N
462	00:32:07	00:32:08	I did not cheat.	N
463	00:32:09	00:32:10	I did not cheat.	N
464	00:32:10	00:32:13	I didn't have to cheat.	N
465	00:32:13	00:32:15	I beat the casinos.	Y
466	00:32:15	00:32:18	I beat 'em, and they ganged up on me, and, uh...	Y
467	00:32:18	00:32:21	that was it, they didn't want me there anymore.	N
468	00:32:21	00:32:26	You beat Sam Braun's casino and he ended your gambling career.	N
469	00:32:26	00:32:29	You're barred from the casinos for life.	N
470	00:32:29	00:32:31	That sounds like motive to me.	N
471	00:32:31	00:32:34	Motive for what, playing the quarter slots?	N
472	00:32:34	00:32:35	Come on.	N
473	00:32:35	00:32:39	Okay, look, here's a quiz.	N
474	00:32:39	00:32:44	Teddy Keller, Davis Mullins and your son Seth were caught fleecing the Rampart.	N
475	00:32:44	00:32:46	Now two of 'em are dead.	N
476	00:32:46	00:32:49	I had no idea what those two boys were doing.	N
477	00:32:49	00:32:53	But I will tell you this-- I will tell you that my son is a good kid, he's a good boy.	N
478	00:32:53	00:32:56	Then why'd you put him in the middle of your action?	N
479	00:32:56	00:32:58	Why'd you use him to settle an old score?	N
480	00:32:58	00:33:00	Maybe Sam Braun's innocent.	N
481	00:33:00	00:33:04	Maybe Seth whacked his partners because he got caught.	N
482	00:33:04	00:33:13	Stop looking at my son, stop looking at me, and start looking at Sam.	N
483	00:33:16	00:33:18	Garbage detail called it in.	N
484	00:33:18	00:33:21	Says they didn't touch it.	N
485	00:33:23	00:33:26	Well, this is Seth Landers' dorm.	Y
486	00:33:28	00:33:29	There's a lot of garbage build up.	N
487	00:33:29	00:33:31	When was the last pick-up?	N
488	00:33:31	00:33:33	Day before yesterday.	N
489	00:33:33	00:33:34	End of finals party last night.	N
490	00:33:34	00:33:35	Looks like blood.	N
491	00:33:36	00:33:38	Let's hope the killer left his DNA behind.	N
492	00:33:38	00:33:43	.22 revolver, two live rounds, four expended.	N
493	00:33:43	00:33:46	Should be able to pull some prints off it.	N
494	00:33:46	00:33:48	Gun's a relic.	N
495	00:33:48	00:33:50	Doesn't matter if it still works.	N
496	00:34:02	00:34:04	There you go.	N
497	00:34:13	00:34:16	The test fire matches the bullet found in Teddy Keller's body.	N
498	00:34:16	00:34:18	So we've got our murder weapon.	N
499	00:34:18	00:34:21	Yeah, we found our murder weapon.	N
500	00:34:21	00:34:22	I don't know.	N
501	00:34:22	00:34:28	The kid thinks up this elaborate scheme to cheat the casinos.	N
502	00:34:28	00:34:30	Then he kills his partners.	N
503	00:34:31	00:34:32	But he dumps his gun at his dorm?	N
504	00:34:32	00:34:33	An RG .22.	N
505	00:34:33	00:34:36	That's not a very bad ass' first weapon of choice.	N
506	00:34:36	00:34:40	No, it's a small caliber weapon for an up-close-and-personal hit.	N
507	00:34:40	00:34:43	I don't really see the kid pulling a Gotti.	N
508	00:34:43	00:34:46	Okay, two victims, two taps to the head.	N
509	00:34:46	00:34:48	But the loads are different.	N
510	00:34:48	00:34:50	Well, maybe he ran out of ammo.	N
511	00:34:50	00:34:51	Went back and bought another brand.	N
512	00:34:51	00:34:53	And reloaded, yeah.	N
513	00:34:53	00:35:01	The bullets that were found in Teddy Keller's skull, were copper washed CCI .22s.	N
514	00:35:01	00:35:05	And the two rounds found in Davis Mullins were Remington brass washed.	N
515	00:35:05	00:35:12	So, based on the position of the cylinder Remingtons were fired first?	N
516	00:35:19	00:35:25	But that would mean that Davis Mullins was killed in the apartment before Teddy Keller was killed in the Graveyard.	N
517	00:35:25	00:35:26	The timeline's off.	N
518	00:35:28	00:35:31	Blood on the shirt is a match to Davis Mullins.	N
519	00:35:31	00:35:36	Epithelials from inside the shirt belong to Seth Landers.	N
520	00:35:40	00:35:42	What?	N
521	00:35:42	00:35:45	That means Sam Braun's innocent. This time.	N
522	00:35:46	00:35:49	Are you disappointed?	N
523	00:35:49	00:35:51	It's the evidence.	N
524	00:35:56	00:35:57	What's up, man?	Y
525	00:35:57	00:35:59	Am I going to get out of here?	N
526	00:35:59	00:36:00	No.	N
527	00:36:00	00:36:03	Where did you go after Teddy Keller was taken?	Y
528	00:36:03	00:36:09	You know what, you keep on asking me all these questions, but my lawyer says I'm not even supposed to talk to you.	Y
529	00:36:09	00:36:11	Okay, you don't have to talk to me.	Y
530	00:36:11	00:36:14	But you got to know you're looking at two counts of murder.	Y
531	00:36:14	00:36:15	What?	Y
532	00:36:15	00:36:17	I didn't kill anybody.	N
533	00:36:17	00:36:18	This is crazy.	N
534	00:36:18	00:36:19	Then talk to me.	Y
535	00:36:19	00:36:21	Tell me what happened.	Y
536	00:36:21	00:36:23	Where did you go? For real.	N
537	00:36:23	00:36:26	I waited outside the casino for an hour.	N
538	00:36:26	00:36:30	Teddy didn't show up so I went to his place.	Y
539	00:36:30	00:36:32	Davis, where are you, man?	Y
540	00:36:32	00:36:33	Braun got Teddy.	Y
541	00:36:33	00:36:35	Davis, wake up, man!	Y
542	00:36:45	00:36:49	We found the murder weapon that was used to kill your two partners.	Y
543	00:36:49	00:36:53	It was wrapped in your bloody T-shirt.	N
544	00:36:53	00:36:54	Can you tell me about that?	N
545	00:36:54	00:36:59	I have never used a gun in my life.	Y
546	00:36:59	00:37:04	It was found outside of your campus apartment.	N
547	00:37:04	00:37:07	That can't be.	Y
548	00:37:07	00:37:09	Can be.	N
549	00:37:09	00:37:11	Unless you clear it up.	Y
550	00:37:11	00:37:15	Um...	N
551	00:37:15	00:37:23	The rule was that if something went wrong, we were supposed to just go home.	N
552	00:37:23	00:37:31	Uh... so I found the body, got blood all over my shirt, so... I gave it to my dad.	Y
553	00:37:31	00:37:33	I gave my dad the shirt.	N
554	00:37:33	00:37:34	He's the one who had the shirt.	N
555	00:37:34	00:37:36	Dad! Dad!	N
556	00:37:36	00:37:38	Davis... Davis is dead.	Y
557	00:37:38	00:37:40	I think they got Teddy, too.	Y
558	00:37:40	00:37:41	Braun's on to us.	N
559	00:37:41	00:37:43	What am I going to do?	N
560	00:37:43	00:37:44	Give me your shirt.	N
561	00:37:44	00:37:46	Go back to school and lay low.	N
562	00:37:48	00:37:53	Are you trying to tell me that your own father set you up?	N
563	00:37:59	00:38:02	The truth is, I just wanted him to like me.	N
564	00:38:04	00:38:05	But I'm not him.	N
565	00:38:05	00:38:08	You know, I'm never going to be him.	N
566	00:38:08	00:38:11	Counting cards and the poker face.	N
567	00:38:11	00:38:18	They say it's a skill, but it's a gift.	N
568	00:38:18	00:38:20	Till Sam Braun took it away.	N
569	00:38:20	00:38:24	So you went after Sam Braun to prove something to your old man.	N
570	00:38:24	00:38:29	I mean, I went after the whale, but I skinned it.	Y
571	00:38:29	00:38:32	I did what my dad could never do.	Y
572	00:38:38	00:38:40	Does your father own a .22?	N
573	00:38:52	00:38:54	I got nothing.	Y
574	00:39:01	00:39:04	Maybe he was expecting us.	Y
575	00:39:04	00:39:06	You think he cleaned up?	N
576	00:39:13	00:39:14	Well, if he did...	Y
577	00:39:14	00:39:16	he missed a spot.	Y
578	00:39:36	00:39:38	Nice and new in here.	N
579	00:39:43	00:39:47	Sherwin Williams, latex flat.	Y
580	00:39:47	00:39:51	Navajo White. What do you know.	Y
581	00:39:51	00:39:56	Same as the paint on the shirt.	Y
582	00:40:06	00:40:10	What's in the bag, Dad?	N
583	00:40:10	00:40:11	Money from...	N
584	00:40:11	00:40:13	the Tangiers...	N
585	00:40:13	00:40:17	Money from Pike's.	N
586	00:40:17	00:40:19	Bet there's 50 grand in there.	N
587	00:40:21	00:40:23	Plus...	N
588	00:40:23	00:40:26	what could be paint and blood smears.	N
589	00:40:28	00:40:31	That blood could match the stains we found on Davis' shirt.	N
590	00:40:31	00:40:34	I don't understand why he had to kill his kids.	N
591	00:40:34	00:40:37	They were making a lot of money off of Braun.	N
592	00:40:37	00:40:39	Dad was getting his revenge.	N
593	00:40:39	00:40:43	My guess, stopped being about the money.	N
594	00:40:43	00:40:44	( phone ringing ) Yeah.	N
595	00:40:45	00:40:46	Hey, Joe, it's Teddy.	N
596	00:40:46	00:40:47	Oh, hi, Teddy.	N
597	00:40:47	00:40:48	Sam's on to us. He took me to Neon Graveyard.	N
598	00:40:48	00:40:49	Slow down, slow down.	N
599	00:40:49	00:40:50	I had to give him the money.	N
600	00:40:50	00:40:51	I thought he was going to kill me.	N
601	00:40:52	00:40:53	Don't move. I'll be there in a minute.	N
602	00:41:03	00:41:05	Mr. Greene, what's up, man?	N
603	00:41:05	00:41:06	Hey...	N
604	00:41:06	00:41:07	Hey...	N
605	00:41:15	00:41:20	Why settle for the money, when you can frame up your worst enemy for murder.	N
606	00:41:23	00:41:26	Hey, what the hell took you so long?	N
607	00:41:26	00:41:29	Joe... Joe we got a problem.	N
608	00:41:29	00:41:31	Sam... Sam he...	N
609	00:41:31	00:41:33	Turn around and walk.	N
610	00:42:02	00:42:04	Sam.	N
611	00:42:07	00:42:10	Could I buy you some dinner?	N
612	00:42:10	00:42:12	Feeling a little guilty?	N
613	00:42:12	00:42:15	Hey, Sam, where's the ice?	N
614	00:42:15	00:42:17	Next to the TV, kid.	N
615	00:42:24	00:42:28	You want to catch a cheater-- hire one.	N
616	00:42:28	00:42:30	Right.	N
617	00:42:30	00:42:32	He gets to work off his debt.	N
618	00:42:32	00:42:37	On way or another, I always get my money's worth.	N
