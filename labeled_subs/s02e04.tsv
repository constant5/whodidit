4	00:01:03	00:01:06	Wallet still with him, with cash.	N
5	00:01:06	00:01:07	A student.	N
6	00:01:07	00:01:09	Recently voted Class Clown.	N
7	00:01:13	00:01:14	Strange...	N
8	00:01:14	00:01:18	People aren't usually scared of class clowns.	N
9	00:01:20	00:01:21	Who said his shooter was scared?	N
10	00:01:21	00:01:24	Shot him in the back.	N
11	00:01:24	00:01:27	With his zipper down and hands otherwise engaged.	N
12	00:01:27	00:01:30	Yeah.	N
13	00:01:30	00:01:31	We're looking for a coward.	N
14	00:02:15	00:02:17	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa...	N
15	00:02:17	00:02:18	What're you doing?	N
16	00:02:18	00:02:19	Removing graffiti.	N
17	00:02:19	00:02:22	There's been a murder here, nothing gets cleaned.	N
18	00:02:22	00:02:23	It's school policy, Miss.	N
19	00:02:23	00:02:25	I have to get the graffiti down as soon...	N
20	00:02:25	00:02:26	Everything is evidence.	N
21	00:02:26	00:02:28	Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
22	00:02:28	00:02:29	Should we call the Sheriff?	N
23	00:02:33	00:02:35	No.	N
24	00:02:35	00:02:36	Thank you.	N
25	00:02:40	00:02:42	Bet you were like that in high school.	N
26	00:02:42	00:02:43	Worse.	N
27	00:02:43	00:02:45	Ooh... You were the girl I ran away from.	N
28	00:02:45	00:02:49	Yeah, till you caught me.	N
29	00:02:49	00:02:52	45?	N
30	00:02:52	00:02:53	That's right.	N
31	00:02:53	00:02:57	And it was okay for a student like the victim to return to the school property to use the restroom?	N
32	00:02:58	00:02:59	That wasn't out of the ordinary?	N
33	00:02:59	00:03:00	Hand me a bindle.	N
34	00:03:00	00:03:07	The place isn't locked up till the janitor leaves 00-8 the kids at after-school events use the facilities.	N
35	00:03:07	00:03:08	Brass.	N
36	00:03:08	00:03:13	Excuse me, one of my students is dead are we interrupting you?	N
37	00:03:13	00:03:15	Yeah, a little.	N
38	00:03:15	00:03:19	That's okay, I'll drop by your office.	N
39	00:03:19	00:03:21	We'll finish this up.	N
40	00:03:23	00:03:26	You found the slug.	N
41	00:03:28	00:03:31	So the treasure hunt paid off, huh?	N
42	00:03:31	00:03:32	Yeah, it better.	N
43	00:03:32	00:03:34	We have a point of reference.	N
44	00:03:34	00:03:36	Well, the nerd squad is off and running.	N
45	00:03:37	00:03:41	I'm going to burn a little shoe leather; see if the vic had a beef with anyone.	N
46	00:03:44	00:03:47	Rescue One, approaching drop site.	N
47	00:03:52	00:03:54	We have a visual, Baker One.	N
48	00:03:54	00:03:56	Stand by for eastern approach.	N
49	00:04:03	00:04:05	CSI, ready for descent.	N
50	00:04:06	00:04:08	You're good to go!	N
51	00:04:08	00:04:10	Okay, there he is!	N
52	00:04:10	00:04:11	Let's get down there.	N
53	00:04:14	00:04:16	Ready?	N
54	00:04:16	00:04:18	I'll race you.	N
55	00:04:21	00:04:23	They're sliding through the air.	N
56	00:04:26	00:04:28	CSI is on the ground.	N
57	00:04:30	00:04:33	Stokes, Sidle Crime Lab.	N
58	00:04:33	00:04:34	Did you open the bag?	N
59	00:04:34	00:04:36	Long enough to see one gnarly looking hand.	N
60	00:04:36	00:04:38	Well, skeleton of a hand.	N
61	00:04:42	00:04:43	Anyone touch the bag since?	N
62	00:04:43	00:04:45	With that smell?	N
63	00:04:45	00:04:47	I thought you Emergency Service guys were tougher than that.	N
64	00:04:47	00:04:49	Hey, I'm plenty tough.	N
65	00:04:49	00:04:51	Down, boy it was a joke.	N
66	00:04:52	00:04:55	Nothing like flirting over a D.B.	N
67	00:04:57	00:04:59	You want to airlift the body to the Coroner's?	N
68	00:04:59	00:05:01	We'll radio ahead?	N
69	00:05:01	00:05:02	Sure.	N
70	00:05:02	00:05:03	Wait.	N
71	00:05:06	00:05:07	Are you supposed to do that already?	N
72	00:05:07	00:05:11	Body's Coroner's, property's ours.	N
73	00:05:27	00:05:28	We have the basket.	N
74	00:05:28	00:05:30	Copy that.	N
75	00:05:32	00:05:35	Rescue One returning to base.	N
76	00:05:39	00:05:40	Hi.	N
77	00:05:40	00:05:42	Construction on Flamingo. Sorry.	N
78	00:05:42	00:05:44	Give me a hand, will you?	N
79	00:05:44	00:05:46	Yeah.	N
80	00:05:48	00:05:49	A .38?	N
81	00:05:49	00:05:52	.44.	N
82	00:05:52	00:05:53	Here, take this.	N
83	00:05:57	00:06:00	Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right?	N
84	00:06:00	00:06:02	Orange, by my kit.	N
85	00:06:02	00:06:04	It was in his backpack.	N
86	00:06:09	00:06:11	Did you get something?	N
87	00:06:11	00:06:13	Paint from another source.	N
88	00:06:13	00:06:16	I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker.	N
89	00:06:18	00:06:20	Kind of weird being in a high school, huh?	N
90	00:06:20	00:06:22	They do have a timeless quality.	N
91	00:06:22	00:06:24	What were you? A jock or a brain?	N
92	00:06:24	00:06:26	I was a ghost.	N
93	00:06:26	00:06:27	There.	N
94	00:06:31	00:06:32	Shooter was standing right there.	N
95	00:06:46	00:06:47	And...?	N
96	00:06:47	00:06:52	Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking...	N
97	00:06:52	00:06:54	Five-four...	N
98	00:06:54	00:06:55	maybe three.	N
99	00:06:55	00:06:56	We got ourselves a shorty.	N
100	00:06:58	00:07:01	Let's see what metal shows up.	N
101	00:07:03	00:07:05	Well, there's no gun on our dead body.	N
102	00:07:05	00:07:08	Wouldn't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in?	N
103	00:07:08	00:07:11	I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps.	N
104	00:07:13	00:07:17	I see a coin. Looks like a half dollar.	N
105	00:07:17	00:07:19	Silver, whole.	N
106	00:07:19	00:07:21	I've done a few of these.	N
107	00:07:22	00:07:24	What's that?	N
108	00:07:24	00:07:26	There. About four inches long. What is that?	N
109	00:07:27	00:07:28	It looks like a pin.	N
110	00:07:28	00:07:29	It's a medical implant.	N
111	00:07:32	00:07:34	Oh, and that's a plate in the skull.	N
112	00:07:34	00:07:36	The head's been rolled.	N
113	00:07:36	00:07:38	I'd say we're dealing with a male.	N
114	00:07:38	00:07:41	Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months.	N
115	00:07:41	00:07:42	Sound?	N
116	00:07:43	00:07:45	You weren't here when ESD brought this in.	N
117	00:07:45	00:07:48	Well, it wasn't from lack of trying.	N
118	00:07:51	00:07:52	Let's go to the VIP room.	N
119	00:07:52	00:07:55	I'll show you what I mean.	N
120	00:07:59	00:08:01	That's Dennis Fram's locker.	N
121	00:08:01	00:08:05	And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before?	N
122	00:08:05	00:08:08	Look, I'm the school counselor I don't know every move these kids make.	Y
123	00:08:08	00:08:11	Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead.	N
124	00:08:13	00:08:16	Tell me what stick means.	N
125	00:08:20	00:08:24	Is that a polymer sensor proboscis?	N
126	00:08:24	00:08:26	Cyranose 320.	N
127	00:08:26	00:08:29	Company sent it to me, gratis for a week.	N
128	00:08:29	00:08:31	They figure if it helps CSI will buy one.	N
129	00:08:31	00:08:33	Electronic noses run like ten grand.	N
130	00:08:33	00:08:41	Yeah, well, what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?	N
131	00:08:41	00:08:47	If that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in the ass the county would not approve a $10,000 purchase order.	N
132	00:08:47	00:08:52	I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took.	N
133	00:08:52	00:08:54	And to hell with the budgets.	N
134	00:08:54	00:08:56	Our job is to think, Warrick.	N
135	00:08:56	00:08:59	Machinery should never matter more than our mind.	N
136	00:09:01	00:09:02	Try this.	N
137	00:09:05	00:09:07	Glass tube.	N
138	00:09:07	00:09:08	Air pump.	N
139	00:09:08	00:09:09	Air pump.	N
140	00:09:09	00:09:11	Cost about ten bucks.	N
141	00:09:11	00:09:14	Absorption agent?	N
142	00:09:14	00:09:18	Fresh out. Improvise.	N
143	00:09:22	00:09:27	And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year.	Y
144	00:09:27	00:09:31	He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build.	N
145	00:09:31	00:09:33	Skinny, shorty that kind of thing.	N
146	00:09:33	00:09:36	Dennis is slight and Barry always picks on him for it.	N
147	00:09:36	00:09:38	Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?	Y
148	00:09:38	00:09:40	Of course, but he would never hurt Barry.	N
149	00:09:41	00:09:42	He's a good kid.	N
150	00:09:42	00:09:44	He's totally nonviolent.	N
151	00:09:44	00:09:46	Well, then, this will be brief.	N
152	00:09:49	00:09:53	We can call him from my office.	Y
153	00:09:53	00:09:54	Cathy, you coming?	N
154	00:09:55	00:09:57	Oh, I'll catch up to you.	N
155	00:10:01	00:10:02	Hey...	N
156	00:10:02	00:10:04	I need to talk to you.	N
157	00:10:04	00:10:06	I didn't clean anything.	N
158	00:10:06	00:10:08	It's not about that.	N
159	00:10:09	00:10:10	How tall are you, Dennis?	N
160	00:10:13	00:10:15	Five-three and one quarter.	N
161	00:10:17	00:10:19	Have you washed your hands in the last hour?	N
162	00:10:19	00:10:21	Yeah. Why?	N
163	00:10:21	00:10:23	Changed your shirt?	N
164	00:10:23	00:10:25	No.	N
165	00:10:25	00:10:27	I'd like to do a test on your shirt if I may.	N
166	00:10:27	00:10:29	What kind of test?	N
167	00:10:29	00:10:30	Forensic.	N
168	00:10:51	00:10:53	What is that?	N
169	00:10:53	00:10:54	G.S.R.	N
170	00:10:54	00:11:00	When someone fires a weapon gunshot residue plumes back onto their hands and clothing.	N
171	00:11:05	00:11:08	This means that you fired a gun within the last three to six hours.	N
172	00:11:08	00:11:09	Dennis...	N
173	00:11:09	00:11:11	The police are going to want to talk to you.	N
174	00:11:14	00:11:16	So, you admit you fired a gun.	N
175	00:11:16	00:11:18	I was over at the shooting range on Desert Way.	N
176	00:11:18	00:11:23	So the same night that Barry Schickel was shot and killed you were out taking target practice?	N
177	00:11:23	00:11:24	I go every Monday night.	N
178	00:11:24	00:11:26	You can ask my sister. She goes with me.	N
179	00:11:26	00:11:28	Where's your gun?	N
180	00:11:28	00:11:29	I rent different ones there.	N
181	00:11:29	00:11:31	Did you ever rent a .44 caliber?	N
182	00:11:31	00:11:34	Sometimes.	N
183	00:11:34	00:11:36	I'm going to see my brother!	N
184	00:11:36	00:11:38	Get out of the way!	N
185	00:11:38	00:11:40	Denny, are you okay? Got your call.	N
186	00:11:40	00:11:41	I'm fine, I'm fine.	N
187	00:11:41	00:11:43	We're conducting a police investigation here.	N
188	00:11:43	00:11:47	My dad's back in town tonight and you'll be sorry you harassed my little brother.	N
189	00:11:47	00:11:48	Questioned.	N
190	00:11:49	00:11:52	A student was shot and killed in this building tonight.	N
191	00:11:52	00:11:53	You know what?	N
192	00:11:53	00:11:56	Dennis has explained to you about the gunpowder.	N
193	00:11:56	00:11:59	and I am sure his sister will vouch for his whereabouts.	Y
194	00:11:59	00:12:00	And he's a minor.	N
195	00:12:00	00:12:01	Jim.	N
196	00:12:01	00:12:04	We'll be in touch.	N
197	00:12:09	00:12:12	Remember, breathe through your mouth.	N
198	00:12:28	00:12:29	Metal plate.	N
199	00:12:34	00:12:36	Silver dollar.	N
200	00:12:42	00:12:44	Gambling chip.	N
201	00:12:46	00:12:47	And...	N
202	00:12:48	00:12:51	Aah.	N
203	00:12:51	00:12:54	Jacket government issue, Army.	N
204	00:12:54	00:12:56	Ugh.	N
205	00:12:57	00:12:58	Pile of bones and that's it.	N
206	00:12:58	00:13:00	That's it?	N
207	00:13:00	00:13:03	No organs no-no tonsils, no...	N
208	00:13:05	00:13:08	...soup?	N
209	00:13:08	00:13:09	Human soup.	N
210	00:13:09	00:13:13	Well, we are 73.5% liquid, eh, Dave?	N
211	00:13:13	00:13:17	Add some bacteria, a couple gases, and... voila!	N
212	00:13:17	00:13:20	Okay, I'll take Liquid Man's jacket, see what I can find.	N
213	00:13:20	00:13:22	I'll cremate this.	N
214	00:13:22	00:13:23	What if we find the family or they find us?	N
215	00:13:24	00:13:27	A decomp this bad can stink up the entire building forever.	N
216	00:13:27	00:13:29	The sooner we dispose of this, the better.	N
217	00:13:29	00:13:32	Not for our investigation.	N
218	00:13:32	00:13:33	Sorry.	N
219	00:13:37	00:13:41	Let me guess. Decomp in an enclosed space?	N
220	00:13:41	00:13:42	Yeah.	N
221	00:13:42	00:13:43	Yeah, in a zip bag.	N
222	00:13:43	00:13:45	Lemons.	N
223	00:13:45	00:13:47	Lemons?	N
224	00:13:47	00:13:49	What?	N
225	00:13:49	00:13:51	Use lemons.	N
226	00:13:51	00:13:54	Huh. Hmm.	N
227	00:14:52	00:14:54	So how's your new toy working out?	N
228	00:14:54	00:14:57	It's been downsized.	N
229	00:14:57	00:14:58	Bummer.	N
230	00:14:58	00:14:59	I know how you wanted to see that thing work.	N
231	00:14:59	00:15:04	Well, it's the same difference, really.	N
232	00:15:04	00:15:10	Air is drawn into the glass tube the chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air.	N
233	00:15:12	00:15:15	And mass spec'll break it down at the lab.	N
234	00:15:15	00:15:20	So why did you need the expensive one in the first place?	N
235	235	235	00:15:20	00:15:21	'Cause it was cool.	N
236	00:15:24	00:15:25	I'll see you in homeroom.	N
237	00:15:25	00:15:26	All right.	N
238	00:15:27	00:15:30	Barry Schickel from the high school.	N
239	00:15:30	00:15:32	Dug three of these .44's from his back.	N
240	00:15:34	00:15:36	First one cracked his infraspinous fossa.	N
241	00:15:36	00:15:38	Second one entered...	N
242	00:15:38	00:15:41	past the interior angle of the scapula punctured a lung.	N
243	00:15:41	00:15:46	And the last one entered just right of the right anterior sarratus muscle pierced the heart.	N
244	00:15:47	00:15:49	The heart? That makes no sense.	N
245	00:15:49	00:15:51	This is a special case.	N
246	00:15:52	00:15:55	See the scar?	N
247	00:15:55	00:15:57	This guy was attacked before.	N
248	00:15:57	00:16:00	I'd say in the last six months.	N
249	00:16:00	00:16:03	But not with a knife, it looks like prongs.	N
250	00:16:03	00:16:06	Whatever it was, it would've killed him.	N
251	00:16:06	00:16:07	If his heart had been there.	N
252	00:16:09	00:16:11	Where was his heart?	N
253	00:16:11	00:16:13	Barry's upper body?	N
254	00:16:13	00:16:19	All his internal organs are on the opposite side of typical placement.	N
255	00:16:20	00:16:23	Dextrocardia? Like Dr. No?	N
256	00:16:23	00:16:27	That only presents in, what .01% of the population?	N
257	00:16:27	00:16:31	Which was good for this guy, until his luck ran out.	N
258	00:16:35	00:16:37	How long ago did you say he was stabbed?	N
259	00:16:37	00:16:40	Six months, hand-to-hand combat.	N
260	00:16:40	00:16:42	Sound like something your suspect would do?	N
261	00:16:42	00:16:46	No.	N
262	00:17:03	00:17:05	Hey, how's Liquid Man doing?	N
263	00:17:05	00:17:09	You mean Mr. Cartsen?	N
264	00:17:09	00:17:10	I found this, it's a...	N
265	00:17:10	00:17:12	name tag.	N
266	00:17:13	00:17:19	You know, Sara, a lot of homeless guys get these Army jackets cheap at salvage stores.	N
267	00:17:19	00:17:21	Well, it's a start.	N
268	00:17:22	00:17:27	I'm going to get Homicide to check the VA medical database for a W. Cartsen with plates or pins.	N
269	00:17:27	00:17:28	Okay.	N
270	00:17:33	00:17:35	Ugh...	N
271	00:17:39	00:17:41	What do you got?	N
272	00:17:41	00:17:42	I don't know.	N
273	00:17:43	00:17:46	I can't read an address or a phone number... God, it reeks!	N
274	00:17:46	00:17:49	Q.D. should be able to, uh...	N
275	00:17:49	00:17:51	to bring something up...	N
276	00:17:57	00:17:59	Don't tell anyone.	N
277	00:17:59	00:18:01	About what?	N
278	00:18:04	00:18:05	Sara?	N
279	00:18:05	00:18:08	Hi.	N
280	00:18:08	00:18:10	They told me out front I could find you...	N
281	00:18:10	00:18:11	here.	N
282	00:18:11	00:18:13	Yeah.	N
283	00:18:13	00:18:15	Um...	N
284	00:18:15	00:18:16	I'll be right out.	N
285	00:18:18	00:18:20	Give me a mint.	N
286	00:18:20	00:18:21	You're going to need more than one.	N
287	00:18:21	00:18:23	Just give me. ( chuckling )	N
288	00:18:28	00:18:30	This is a nice surprise.	N
289	00:18:30	00:18:32	I wanted to see if you'd like to have dinner.	N
290	00:18:32	00:18:33	Yeah.	N
291	00:18:33	00:18:35	Um... when?	N
292	00:18:35	00:18:37	Now, I'm on break.	N
293	00:18:37	00:18:39	Oh, well, I'm in the middle of that D.B. from the gully.	N
294	00:18:39	00:18:42	He's still a John Doe and we don't know the circumstances.	N
295	00:18:44	00:18:45	I smell.	N
296	00:18:45	00:18:47	No...	N
297	00:18:47	00:18:48	Well, not that bad.	N
298	00:18:48	00:18:56	I changed clothes-- the problem is that it's human fat reduced and it's attached itself to my follicles and my pores, so...	N
299	00:18:58	00:18:59	You don't look good.	N
300	00:18:59	00:19:00	I need to get some air.	N
301	00:19:00	00:19:01	Okay.	N
302	00:19:01	00:19:02	Uh, no, you-you stay.	N
303	00:19:02	00:19:04	Uh, you've got that John Doe to worry about and, uh...	N
304	00:19:04	00:19:06	Well, I can always stop by another time.	N
305	00:19:06	00:19:09	Great.	N
306	00:19:09	00:19:10	Okay.	N
307	00:19:10	00:19:13	Bye...	N
308	00:19:17	00:19:18	You smell like death.	N
309	00:19:18	00:19:21	I've heard.	N
310	00:19:21	00:19:24	You know, a real man wouldn't mind.	N
311	00:19:32	00:19:34	Have you talked to Barry's parents?	N
312	00:19:34	00:19:36	I did; they had no idea he'd been stabbed.	N
313	00:19:36	00:19:39	The older kids get the less they talk to their parents.	N
314	00:19:39	00:19:41	They talk to you, though, right?	Y
315	00:19:41	00:19:42	The guidance counselor?	Y
316	00:19:42	00:19:45	Who else may have had it in for Barry Schickel?	N
317	00:19:45	00:19:49	Look, he was very popular, but he was a bully.	N
318	00:19:49	00:19:54	So there was probably a dozen kids who wanted to see him dead.	N
319	00:19:54	00:19:55	Really?	N
320	00:19:55	00:19:58	I'd be walking by and... he would punch me.	N
321	00:20:01	00:20:04	Everybody started calling me Flinch.	N
322	00:20:04	00:20:06	Even the teachers.	N
323	00:20:06	00:20:08	MOVE!	N
324	00:20:08	00:20:10	He was the meanest guy I've ever known.	N
325	00:20:10	00:20:13	But the way he put you down, it sounded funny.	N
326	00:20:13	00:20:15	If it wasn't you.	N
327	00:20:15	00:20:18	He'd wait for me, every day.	N
328	00:20:18	00:20:22	Lunch time, fourth period. Take my food.	N
329	00:20:22	00:20:24	Yo, hungry? Ha! Thanks for the sandwich.	N
330	00:20:24	00:20:27	Until I fixed him.	N
331	00:20:27	00:20:30	It was about half a year ago, I went at him.	N
332	00:20:30	00:20:32	With a fork?	N
333	00:20:32	00:20:34	Stabbed him above his left pectoral.	N
334	00:20:34	00:20:37	Yeah.	N
335	00:20:37	00:20:39	It still didn't stop him.	N
336	00:20:39	00:20:43	I mean, today was the first day I could come to school and not feel like a moving target.	N
337	00:20:43	00:20:46	00?	N
338	00:20:46	00:20:48	When Barry was shot?	N
339	00:20:50	00:20:55	Boxing practice.	N
340	00:20:55	00:20:58	Okay. Thanks.	N
341	00:21:01	00:21:09	I can protect them from being called a derogatory word for homosexual or the N-word.	Y
342	00:21:09	00:21:11	Everything else falls under free speech.	N
343	00:21:11	00:21:14	No one's blaming you.	N
344	00:21:14	00:21:16	I am.	Y
345	00:21:16	00:21:19	You know who did this, don't you?	Y
346	00:21:19	00:21:24	You have no idea what these kids go through.	N
347	00:21:24	00:21:28	I listen to them every day.	Y
348	00:21:28	00:21:30	Divorce, working parents...	N
349	00:21:30	00:21:32	Cliques.	N
350	00:21:32	00:21:36	And all they need is just one person to believe in them.	N
351	00:21:36	00:21:40	Yeah.	N
352	00:21:40	00:21:42	But where does that leave Barry Schickel?	N
353	00:21:42	00:21:45	That's your job.	N
354	00:21:51	00:21:53	Shut up. She was not.	N
355	00:21:53	00:21:54	I saw her in action.	N
356	00:21:54	00:21:56	Really?	N
357	00:21:56	00:21:57	Yeah, she was.	N
358	00:21:57	00:21:58	Catherine?	N
359	00:21:58	00:21:59	I was what?	N
360	00:22:01	00:22:05	I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully in high school.	N
361	00:22:05	00:22:06	A bully?	N
362	00:22:06	00:22:07	All right, I guess I was.	N
363	00:22:07	00:22:10	But, I mean, not the kind that people want to take a gun out and shoot.	N
364	00:22:11	00:22:11	No.	N
365	00:22:12	00:22:12	No, no.	N
366	00:22:12	00:22:16	You were the kind that guys fall all over themselves trying to impress.	N
367	00:22:16	00:22:17	Like you, Nick, huh?	N
368	00:22:20	00:22:23	Oh, Nick, uh... what were you in high school?	N
369	00:22:23	00:22:26	Me? I was, uh...	N
370	00:22:26	00:22:28	I was dependable.	N
371	00:22:28	00:22:29	Dependable.	N
372	00:22:29	00:22:33	Dependable jock, dependable stoner?	N
373	00:22:33	00:22:35	No, never a strap, never a smoker.	N
374	00:22:35	00:22:38	Just all-around dependable guy, I guess.	N
375	00:22:38	00:22:39	He's trying to say he was unpopular.	N
376	00:22:40	00:22:43	I was popular with the right people I can tell you that.	N
377	00:22:43	00:22:45	I can also tell you what I wasn't.	N
378	00:22:45	00:22:50	I wasn't a Mac Daddy wannabe with a Members Only jacket, putting his swerve on all the ladies.	N
379	00:22:50	00:22:51	What was wrong with those Members Only jackets?	N
380	00:22:51	00:22:52	They were kind of cool back in the day.	N
381	00:22:52	00:22:54	Hey, Nick.	N
382	00:22:54	00:22:56	Ronnie's got something on Liquid Man, says it's hot.	N
383	00:22:56	00:22:58	Good.	N
384	00:22:59	00:23:01	Hey, Sara, what were you in high school?	N
385	00:23:01	00:23:04	Science nerd.	N
386	00:23:04	00:23:05	You changed...	N
387	00:23:05	00:23:08	but you still smell.	N
388	00:23:08	00:23:09	Let's go.	N
389	00:23:09	00:23:11	So that leaves you, Warrick.	N
390	00:23:11	00:23:13	What were you?	N
391	00:23:13	00:23:18	Oh, I was short, I had big feet, thick glasses.	N
392	00:23:18	00:23:19	You?!	N
393	00:23:19	00:23:20	Yeah.	N
394	00:23:20	00:23:24	I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls.	N
395	00:23:24	00:23:28	The girls didn't even notice your eyes?	N
396	00:23:28	00:23:30	No, they used to tease me about my eyes.	N
397	00:23:30	00:23:31	Called me names.	N
398	00:23:31	00:23:34	Aw. Well, what do they know?	N
399	00:23:34	00:23:36	They're your best feature.	N
400	00:23:36	00:23:38	I didn't have a best feature in high school.	N
401	00:23:40	00:23:49	Looking back on it now I can say I could see both sides of it thinking about this guy Barry Schickel, and how he was shot and whichever kid did it.	N
402	00:23:49	00:23:54	I'm not saying it was right, but I kind of understand, you know?	N
403	00:23:54	00:23:57	Yeah.	N
404	00:24:04	00:24:09	I wanted to hold off on this matchbook until it dried out but then I realized...	N
405	00:24:09	00:24:12	Human fat never dries out, it just gets waxy.	N
406	00:24:12	00:24:13	Exactly.	N
407	00:24:13	00:24:22	What I'm doing is adding pixels at some points and erasing pixels at other points.	N
408	00:24:40	00:24:42	Got it.	N
409	00:24:42	00:24:44	Roma...	N
410	00:24:44	00:24:46	Roman... nini's...	N
411	00:24:46	00:24:47	Never heard of it.	N
412	00:24:47	00:24:49	I have.	N
413	00:24:49	00:24:51	Nightclub for boomers off the strip.	N
414	00:24:51	00:24:52	Thanks, man.	N
415	00:24:52	00:24:53	You bet.	N
416	00:24:56	00:24:57	Hey, Stokes.	N
417	00:24:57	00:24:58	Your W. Cartsen?	N
418	00:24:58	00:24:59	Yeah?	N
419	00:25:00	00:25:02	He's a Second Lieutenant William Cartsen.	N
420	00:25:02	00:25:04	Served in the war, wounded in action.	N
421	00:25:04	00:25:07	Got sent stateside after they put him back together.	N
422	00:25:07	00:25:11	They put a pin in his spine and a plate in his head 31 years ago.	N
423	00:25:11	00:25:14	Walked out of the hospital, hasn't been heard of since.	N
424	00:25:15	00:25:16	Okay. Come with us.	N
425	00:26:04	00:26:06	What's the matter, you don't trust me?	N
426	00:26:07	00:26:08	I trust you.	N
427	00:26:16	00:26:19	I got a boatload of chemical components here.	N
428	00:26:19	00:26:23	Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars.	N
429	00:26:23	00:26:26	It's like every guy's bathroom in America.	N
430	00:26:26	00:26:27	What doesn't belong?	N
431	00:26:36	00:26:38	How can I help you people?	Y
432	00:26:39	00:26:41	Valet guy said you're the manager.	Y
433	00:26:41	00:26:43	Detective O'Riley, Las Vegas P.D.	N
434	00:26:44	00:26:45	Stokes and Sidle from the Crime Lab.	N
435	00:26:45	00:26:46	Crime Lab?	N
436	00:26:46	00:26:48	What's going on?	N
437	00:26:48	00:26:50	This man a patron of your establishment?	Y
438	00:26:50	00:26:52	Name's William Cartsen.	N
439	00:26:52	00:26:54	Not that I recognize, no.	Y
440	00:26:54	00:26:56	Are you sure you haven't seen him around here?	Y
441	00:26:57	00:27:00	Wore an Army jacket, might've been down on his luck?	N
442	00:27:00	00:27:02	Oh, you mean Moses.	N
443	00:27:02	00:27:04	Moses?	N
444	00:27:04	00:27:08	Yeah, guy had a beard down to here, wore a robe the Army jacket.	N
445	00:27:08	00:27:11	Stood out here scaring every patron I had.	Y
446	00:27:11	00:27:13	Hey!	N
447	00:27:13	00:27:14	The whole world is watching.	N
448	00:27:14	00:27:15	Bidi dou!	N
449	00:27:15	00:27:16	Bidi dou!	N
450	00:27:16	00:27:18	Guy was ruining my business.	Y
451	00:27:18	00:27:19	So what'd you do?	Y
452	00:27:19	00:27:21	I tried to reason with him.	Y
453	00:27:21	00:27:23	( Moses yells ) Hey!	N
454	00:27:23	00:27:27	Hey, buddy, you've got to leave my customers alone, okay?	Y
455	00:27:27	00:27:31	Here.	N
456	00:27:31	00:27:34	Cash that and move on.	N
457	00:27:34	00:27:35	That's the last I saw of him.	Y
458	00:27:35	00:27:37	When was that?	N
459	00:27:37	00:27:39	I don't know, about two months ago.	N
460	00:27:39	00:27:41	That's funny we found his body.	N
461	00:27:41	00:27:43	Coroner says he's been dead two months.	N
462	00:27:43	00:27:47	We're going to want you to take a little ride with us.	Y
463	00:27:47	00:27:50	Okay.	N
464	00:28:01	00:28:04	I checked out those kids you talked to.	N
465	00:28:04	00:28:09	None of them was even near the school when Barry Schickel was killed.	N
466	00:28:09	00:28:11	The only one who doesn't check out is Dennis Fram.	N
467	00:28:11	00:28:13	There's a reason.	N
468	00:28:13	00:28:14	I can put him at the crime scene.	N
469	00:28:14	00:28:16	Jim, can you call them from the car?	N
470	00:28:16	00:28:17	Sure, let's go.	N
471	00:28:17	00:28:18	Put him there, how?	N
472	00:28:18	00:28:20	Well, I'll explain on the way.	N
473	00:28:20	00:28:21	No, no.	N
474	00:28:21	00:28:23	I'm going to stay here with this, close to Warrick.	N
475	00:28:23	00:28:26	Okay. But you'll miss all the fireworks.	N
476	00:28:34	00:28:40	I know I must sound like the typical parent but my son had nothing to do with the death of the Schickel boy.	N
477	00:28:40	00:28:42	We've placed him at the murder.	N
478	00:28:42	00:28:43	What?	N
479	00:28:43	00:28:47	Here's the fingerprint that I recovered from Dennis' locker.	N
480	00:28:47	00:28:54	These are Dennis' prints on file at school-- the Missing Kids Prevention Drive.	N
481	00:28:54	00:28:56	There's a match.	N
482	00:28:56	00:29:00	Well, his own fingerprint on his own locker that doesn't prove anything.	N
483	00:29:00	00:29:02	Proves a timeline.	N
484	00:29:02	00:29:08	The alkyd particles in the victim's spray paint adhere and dry in 30 seconds.	N
485	00:29:10	00:29:11	Oxidation.	N
486	00:29:11	00:29:19	Dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of Barry putting it on his locker for his print to take.	N
487	00:29:19	00:29:20	Well, how do you know...?	N
488	00:29:20	00:29:21	The janitor.	N
489	00:29:21	00:29:23	He keeps timed records of graffiti.	N
490	00:29:23	00:29:26	Job security.	N
491	00:29:26	00:29:31	And Dennis left paint on the door jamb in the bathroom where Barry was shot.	N
492	00:29:32	00:29:36	That's the timeline of the murder, Mr. Fram.	N
493	00:29:36	00:29:38	We know every move your son made up until the gun.	N
494	00:29:38	00:29:40	That's why we want to see your collection.	N
495	00:29:40	00:29:43	You're registered as having two dozen weapons?	N
496	00:29:43	00:29:44	Denny?	N
497	00:29:44	00:29:45	Ow...	N
498	00:29:45	00:29:47	It's okay, it's okay.	N
499	00:29:47	00:29:48	Come on.	N
500	00:29:48	00:29:51	We'll fix it.	N
501	00:29:56	00:30:01	This... does not belong in a guy's bathroom.	N
502	00:30:01	00:30:02	Can we prove this?	N
503	00:30:02	00:30:06	I mean, there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out there.	N
504	00:30:06	00:30:08	You still got that $10,000 e-nose you were using?	N
505	00:30:08	00:30:11	Oh, now you want my tricked-out toy.	N
506	00:30:11	00:30:13	I just want the software.	N
507	00:30:18	00:30:20	Come on, drink up.	N
508	00:30:20	00:30:21	Here you go.	N
509	00:30:21	00:30:24	Good.	N
510	00:30:26	00:30:29	Just hold this to your face, okay?	N
511	00:30:29	00:30:30	I'll be right back.	N
512	00:30:33	00:30:38	He's got a bleeding ulcer from being bullied by Barry Schickel.	N
513	00:30:42	00:30:44	Hey, shrimp, want to go for a ride?	N
514	00:30:46	00:30:51	You don't know how hard it was for him every morning trying to work up the courage just to go to school.	N
515	00:30:58	00:31:01	I thought my little brother was going to kill himself.	N
516	00:31:01	00:31:03	And then someone killed Barry.	N
517	00:31:05	00:31:06	Yeah.	N
518	00:31:06	00:31:09	How tall are you?	N
519	00:31:09	00:31:12	Five-four... with heels.	N
520	00:31:14	00:31:16	Why?	N
521	00:31:16	00:31:19	No reason.	N
522	00:31:19	00:31:24	You grabbed a top note of floral and now we ask the software to break it into ingredients.	N
523	00:31:24	00:31:26	Do you recognize any of these?	N
524	00:31:26	00:31:28	That's all from one perfume?	N
525	00:31:29	00:31:32	Some of these perfumes have, like, 750 ingredients.	N
526	00:31:35	00:31:37	Chanteuse.	N
527	00:31:39	00:31:41	We can narrow it down to one brand?	N
528	00:31:41	00:31:44	Yeah, the original application for this program was perfume companies.	N
529	00:31:44	00:31:48	You know, testing new brands stealing from the competition.	N
530	00:31:50	00:31:52	Grissom.	N
531	00:31:52	00:31:53	Grissom, we got a suspect.	N
532	00:31:53	00:31:55	But it's not who you think.	N
533	00:31:55	00:31:56	Let me guess.	N
534	00:31:57	00:31:58	Denny Fram's sister?	N
535	00:31:58	00:32:00	How did you know?	N
536	00:32:00	00:32:02	Vapor molecules.	N
537	00:32:02	00:32:05	See if you can get a warrant for her perfume and have Brass bring her in.	N
538	00:32:05	00:32:07	Her perfume?	N
539	00:32:07	00:32:09	Let's get back to my first question, Miss Fram.	N
540	00:32:09	00:32:12	Where were you the night Barry Schickel was killed?	N
541	00:32:12	00:32:16	I told you, I was out driving around.	N
542	00:32:16	00:32:22	So what, your perfume just wafted into the boys' room all the way from Highway 10?	N
543	00:32:22	00:32:26	Yes. I wear Chanteuse.	N
544	00:32:26	00:32:28	What's that got to do with anything?	N
545	00:32:28	00:32:34	My mom used to wear it, and... after her car accident I started to wear it.	N
546	00:32:34	00:32:36	Well, aromas have fingerprints.	N
547	00:32:36	00:32:41	They're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air, long after the source has gone.	N
548	00:32:41	00:32:47	We isolated a combination in the restroom where Barry Schickel was shot.	N
549	00:32:47	00:32:49	It matches your perfume.	N
550	00:32:49	00:32:50	A high-end woman's perfume.	N
551	00:32:50	00:32:54	It's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it.	N
552	00:32:54	00:32:55	Wait, wait, wait...	N
553	00:32:55	00:32:57	She has no reason to hurt Barry Schickel.	N
554	00:32:57	00:32:59	What about revenge for her little brother?	N
555	00:33:00	00:33:01	I can't believe this.	N
556	00:33:01	00:33:06	That bastard Schickel dogged my family now he's doing it from the grave.	N
557	00:33:06	00:33:09	Come on, Kelsey.	N
558	00:33:09	00:33:12	You come near us again you do it through my lawyer.	N
559	00:33:18	00:33:21	Wears her dead mother's perfume.	N
560	00:33:21	00:33:22	Nice touch.	N
561	00:33:24	00:33:25	Might be true.	N
562	00:33:25	00:33:28	Scent triggers memory more acutely than any of the five senses.	N
563	00:33:28	00:33:30	Yeah?	N
564	00:33:30	00:33:34	Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.	N
565	00:33:39	00:33:39	So you didn't hurt him.	Y
566	00:33:40	00:33:41	You just put him in your car.	Y
567	00:33:41	00:33:42	Is that what you're saying?	Y
568	00:33:42	00:33:44	Back seat. Then I drove him out of town.	Y
569	00:33:44	00:33:46	I left him on the side of the road, out by Red Rock.	Y
570	00:33:47	00:33:52	You didn't maybe zip him up in a bag because he was giving you trouble anything like that?	Y
571	00:33:54	00:33:55	No.	N
572	00:33:57	00:33:59	These...	N
573	00:33:59	00:34:02	are the handles from the bag that he was found in.	N
574	00:34:02	00:34:04	You see these prints here?	Y
575	00:34:09	00:34:10	Can I see your right hand, sir?	Y
576	00:34:12	00:34:13	Look, he was drunk.	N
577	00:34:13	00:34:14	He was rolling all over my backseat.	Y
578	00:34:15	00:34:17	So I put him in a bag from my trunk.	Y
579	00:34:17	00:34:21	Once we got out of town, I just tipped him down the hill.	Y
580	00:34:26	00:34:29	I figured he'd get out once he slept it off.	Y
581	00:34:29	00:34:31	The guy always shows up.	N
582	00:34:33	00:34:34	What am I looking at?	Y
583	00:34:36	00:34:37	Homicide.	N
584	00:34:39	00:34:42	Look, I was just doing my job.	Y
585	00:34:42	00:34:43	Hey...	N
586	00:34:44	00:34:47	treating another human being like garbage is not a job.	N
587	00:34:47	00:34:50	It's a choice.	N
588	00:34:56	00:34:57	Paperwork. Later.	N
589	00:34:57	00:34:59	Dennis?	N
590	00:35:01	00:35:03	I need to talk to you.	N
591	00:35:04	00:35:08	You have to understand anything my sister did was to protect me.	N
592	00:35:09	00:35:12	You said that you went back to the high school that night after target practice.	N
593	00:35:12	00:35:15	I forgot a book I needed for homework.	N
594	00:35:16	00:35:18	And I knew Barry had been there.	N
595	00:35:21	00:35:22	I wasn't looking for him.	N
596	00:35:22	00:35:24	I had to go to the bathroom.	N
597	00:35:38	00:35:40	My dad's freaking out.	N
598	00:35:40	00:35:43	My sister won't come out of her room.	N
599	00:35:43	00:35:48	I figure if you can get the police to make some kind of deal for her...	N
600	00:35:49	00:35:54	Well, Dennis, you haven't told us that you explicitly saw Kelsey shoot the victim.	N
601	00:35:54	00:35:56	She was in a stall. I couldn't see her.	N
602	00:35:57	00:35:58	Can I, uh...	N
603	00:35:58	00:36:00	Can I talk to you for a minute?	N
604	00:36:00	00:36:01	Excuse us.	N
605	00:36:07	00:36:09	He copping to anything?	N
606	00:36:09	00:36:11	He says that his sister did it.	N
607	00:36:11	00:36:13	I don't think so.	N
608	00:36:13	00:36:17	Kelsey was otherwise disposed.	N
609	00:36:17	00:36:23	She got a parking ticket the same time the vic was shot in an alley behind a motel off Fremont Street.	N
610	00:36:23	00:36:27	In fact, a lot of cars got tickets that night.	N
611	00:36:30	00:36:32	Who's Jeremy Spencer?	N
612	00:36:32	00:36:34	Football coach.	N
613	00:36:34	00:36:35	Oh.	N
614	00:36:35	00:36:38	At a motel with the high school coach.	N
615	00:36:38	00:36:40	No wonder she wouldn't talk.	N
616	00:36:40	00:36:42	Well, I paid coach a visit.	N
617	00:36:42	00:36:43	The guy's 23, just got engaged.	N
618	00:36:43	00:36:46	I mean, he'll testify to anything as long as his fiancée doesn't find out.	N
619	00:36:46	00:36:54	He says that Kelsey gave him a roll in the hay asked him to intercede with Barry-the-bully and get the kid to leave her little brother alone.	N
620	00:36:54	00:36:57	She didn't kill anyone.	N
621	00:36:57	00:36:59	So why is he saying she did?	N
622	00:36:59	00:37:03	Do you ever smell a fart and end up blaming the wrong guy?	N
623	00:37:07	00:37:10	Why do you think your sister shot Barry?	N
624	00:37:10	00:37:12	Because.	N
625	00:37:12	00:37:14	Because why?	N
626	626	626	00:37:14	00:37:18	'Cause of the last time he beat me up.	N
627	00:37:23	00:37:25	I'll protect you.	N
628	00:37:25	00:37:29	I'll fix things so he never comes near you again.	N
629	00:37:29	00:37:31	She always keeps her word.	N
630	00:37:31	00:37:33	She asked Barry's coach to help you.	N
631	00:37:33	00:37:35	That was her protection plan.	N
632	00:37:35	00:37:37	She was nowhere near the high school that night.	N
633	00:37:37	00:37:39	I smelled her perfume.	N
634	00:37:39	00:37:41	I saw Barry.	N
635	00:37:41	00:37:42	I saw the gun.	N
636	00:37:42	00:37:44	And I smelled my sister's perfume.	N
637	00:37:46	00:37:48	No.	N
638	00:37:48	00:37:51	You smelled her brand of perfume.	N
639	00:37:51	00:37:53	But then who was it?	N
640	00:38:00	00:38:03	We recovered this from your townhouse on a warrant.	Y
641	00:38:03	00:38:06	Chanteuse.	N
642	00:38:10	00:38:12	We also found the gun.	N
643	00:38:16	00:38:18	It hasn't been cleaned.	N
644	00:38:20	00:38:23	Well, I don't know how to clean a gun.	Y
645	00:38:23	00:38:25	That was my husband's.	Y
646	00:38:25	00:38:28	You know how to shoot one, though.	Y
647	00:38:28	00:38:34	Do you know how many kids go to school and kill just to get relief from the bullying?	N
648	00:38:34	00:38:36	You talked to them.	N
649	00:38:36	00:38:38	Boxing lessons and target practice.	N
650	00:38:39	00:38:44	How long before one of them came in here and opened fire on a hallway full of kids, huh?	N
651	00:38:46	00:38:51	I just thought that one life was better than 20...	Y
652	00:38:51	00:38:54	or 30.	N
653	00:38:55	00:38:57	Or eleven.	N
654	00:39:02	00:39:07	Captain Brass ran a search on you.	Y
655	00:39:08	00:39:10	Tetrick High School, Tetrick, Arizona.	N
656	00:39:10	00:39:14	Eleven kids shot a few days after Columbine.	N
657	00:39:14	00:39:16	You were the Assistant Principal.	Y
658	00:39:19	00:39:24	I watched them die at my feet.	Y
659	00:39:26	00:39:32	Just because some sophomore couldn't take the jokes about his glasses.	N
660	00:39:34	00:39:39	It says that you were left with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.	Y
661	00:39:39	00:39:41	You might want to mention that to your lawyer.	Y
662	00:39:43	00:39:46	I did this for my kids.	Y
663	00:39:46	00:39:55	You know, Miss Barrett as difficult as high school can be for kids eventually, it's over...	Y
664	00:39:57	00:40:00	...but too soon for Barry Schickel.	N
665	00:41:17	00:41:20	Rest in peace, Lieutenant.	N
666	00:41:20	00:42:26	Rest in peace.	N
