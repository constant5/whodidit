0	00:00:35	00:00:38	Joe! Joe!	N
1	00:00:44	00:00:47	I'm not your damn secretary and your wife's not my boss!	N
2	00:00:47	00:00:49	You hear that, Cheryl?	N
3	00:00:49	00:00:51	This is a company phone.	N
4	00:00:58	00:01:02	If this is an Indian burial ground, I'm totally screwed.	N
5	00:01:02	00:01:05	I'll be in litigation for months.	N
6	00:01:05	00:01:09	I can't make any promises, sir, but I don't think the Paiute wore heels.	N
7	00:01:11	00:01:12	Hey! What's it look like?	N
8	00:01:12	00:01:15	Well...	N
9	00:01:15	00:01:17	The body's been encased in something.	N
10	00:01:18	00:01:20	It's black. It's flexible...	N
11	00:01:21	00:01:23	But it's pretty stubborn.	N
12	00:01:23	00:01:24	I think it's roofing tar.	N
13	00:01:24	00:01:27	It keeps the smell and the animals away.	N
14	00:01:27	00:01:29	It makes our job a lot harder.	N
15	00:01:29	00:01:33	We've got disturbed soil in a three-by-five perimeter.	N
16	00:01:33	00:01:36	Okay.	N
17	00:01:36	00:01:37	Gentlemen!	N
18	00:01:37	00:01:39	Start your shovels!	N
19	00:02:00	00:02:02	Do you think our Jane Doe was buried alive?	N
20	00:02:02	00:02:05	Whoever buried her sure had access to a lot of tar.	N
21	00:02:05	00:02:11	Maybe a construction worker.	N
22	00:02:11	00:02:13	Nick, did you get that last soil sample?	N
23	00:02:13	00:02:17	Yeah, but I think I got something else, too.	N
24	00:02:18	00:02:21	Hey, guys.	N
25	00:02:21	00:02:22	Check this out.	N
26	00:02:22	00:02:24	A third foot.	N
27	00:02:24	00:02:26	Ugh...	N
28	00:02:26	00:02:29	Means there's another body.	N
29	00:02:34	00:02:37	I don't know if she was buried alive, but...	N
30	00:02:37	00:02:39	she wasn't buried alone.	N
31	00:03:38	00:03:39	Two sets of hands.	N
32	00:03:39	00:03:41	Two sets of feet.	N
33	00:03:41	00:03:43	Two skulls, two bodies.	N
34	00:03:43	00:03:45	Both appear to be female.	N
35	00:03:45	00:03:47	Jane Doe Bottom's curled up.	N
36	00:03:47	00:03:49	Jane Doe Top's laid out flat.	N
37	00:03:49	00:03:52	This looks like... barbed wire.	N
38	00:03:52	00:03:53	It's in her mouth.	N
39	00:03:53	00:03:55	Could be a dental appliance.	N
40	00:03:55	00:03:57	Or maybe some kind of torture device.	N
41	00:03:58	00:03:59	You're thinking ritualistic?	N
42	00:03:59	00:04:00	I don't know what I'm thinking.	N
43	00:04:02	00:04:03	Hey.	N
44	00:04:03	00:04:06	They told me you dug up two bodies covered in tar?	N
45	00:04:07	00:04:10	So. How you going to separate them?	N
46	00:04:10	00:04:12	I'm not sure yet.	N
47	00:04:12	00:04:17	Obviously I can't saw through without potentially destroying evidence, so...	N
48	00:04:17	00:04:20	If the tar were harder, I could chisel it.	N
49	00:04:20	00:04:24	If it were softer, we could peel it off.	N
50	00:04:24	00:04:26	I have an idea.	N
51	00:04:26	00:04:33	Of course you do, but last I checked, the backlog on grave was about... mmm... a hundred cases?	N
52	00:04:33	00:04:36	You've been spending too much time with Ecklie.	N
53	00:04:36	00:04:39	I'm off the clock.	N
54	00:04:39	00:04:40	I came in early for this.	N
55	00:04:49	00:04:51	You ever done this before?	N
56	00:04:51	00:04:52	Nope...	N
57	00:04:53	00:04:59	but I do know that tar becomes as brittle as glass at about minus 200 degrees.	N
58	00:05:32	00:05:33	Okay, Mr. Wizard.	N
59	00:05:52	00:05:55	Not much left of her but the clothes.	N
60	00:05:55	00:05:58	Well, let's see what our other one looks like, shall we?	N
61	00:06:22	00:06:24	Huh.	N
62	00:06:26	00:06:27	Oh, boy.	N
63	00:06:27	00:06:29	I gotta get my shift started.	N
64	00:06:29	00:06:30	Good luck with the case.	N
65	00:06:30	00:06:31	No, no, no.	N
66	00:06:32	00:06:35	You're not going to just destroy this skull and split.	N
67	00:06:35	00:06:37	You can make a nice mold from the impression.	N
68	00:06:37	00:06:39	I'm short-handed as it is.	N
69	00:06:39	00:06:41	I think Sara just wrapped a case.	N
70	00:06:41	00:06:43	If you need her, she's yours.	N
71	00:06:52	00:06:54	Wow.	N
72	00:06:54	00:06:56	Look at you, Mr. Straightedge.	N
73	00:06:56	00:06:59	I did not know that your hair could do that.	N
74	00:06:59	00:07:00	I look like a dork.	N
75	00:07:00	00:07:01	No, no.	N
76	00:07:01	00:07:03	No, you look like a pro, which is what you are.	N
77	00:07:03	00:07:06	Let me guess-- a prelim for Sherlock?	N
78	00:07:06	00:07:07	Yep.	N
79	00:07:07	00:07:08	Uh-huh. Who's your judge?	N
80	00:07:08	00:07:11	Uh... Dudley... Anderson?	N
81	00:07:11	00:07:14	Yeah. Well, not the sharpest tool in the shed.	N
82	00:07:15	00:07:17	Speak slowly.	N
83	00:07:17	00:07:18	Use simple terms.	N
84	00:07:18	00:07:19	You're gonna nail it.	N
85	00:07:19	00:07:20	Sara.	N
86	00:07:20	00:07:21	You're mine tonight.	N
87	00:09:52	00:09:55	Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Jane Doe Top.	N
88	00:09:55	00:09:57	Nice job.	N
89	00:09:57	00:09:58	Thanks.	N
90	00:10:02	00:10:03	Thank you, Sara.	N
91	00:10:05	00:10:11	Well, Doc Robbins told me that she had severe trauma to the skull, probably what killed her.	N
92	00:10:11	00:10:14	Well, that would explain the blood David found on her shirt.	N
93	00:10:14	00:10:20	Mia's running DNA right now to find out if it matches the victim, or any suspects, for that matter.	N
94	00:10:20	00:10:22	Remember, now, she had a broken jaw.	N
95	00:10:22	00:10:25	That was 26-gauge stainless steel.	N
96	00:10:25	00:10:27	It's used to surgically wire jawbones shut.	N
97	00:10:29	00:10:31	What's with the fingers?	N
98	00:10:31	00:10:33	Distal phalanges were cut off.	N
99	00:10:33	00:10:35	Both vics, both hands.	N
100	00:10:35	00:10:37	I cast tool marks, Looks like some kind of opposed blade tool.	N
101	00:10:38	00:10:39	Jagged on one side, smooth on the other.	N
102	00:10:39	00:10:43	Well, if it was pre-mortem, that would support torture.	N
103	00:10:43	00:10:47	Yeah, but if it was post, they probably did it to conceal identity.	N
104	00:10:47	00:10:50	Hey, you guys still working on that mass- grave theory?	N
105	00:10:50	00:10:51	Yeah.	N
106	00:10:51	00:10:54	You know what I like about flesh decomposing in soil?	N
107	00:10:54	00:10:55	It's predictable.	N
108	00:10:57	00:11:02	The constituent elements diffuse into the ground over time.	N
109	00:11:02	00:11:05	The longer they're there, the lower the concentrations.	N
110	00:11:05	00:11:08	I tested the soil samples Nick took from around each body.	N
111	00:11:08	00:11:12	Curly Sue was on the bottom for at least five years, and Flat Sally was on top for only two.	N
112	00:11:12	00:11:22	So we've got a killer who digs a grave, dumps a body, covers it with tar, comes back three years later, digs again and dumps another one on top of it?	Y
113	00:11:22	00:11:24	Ten to one, it's domestic abuse.	N
114	00:11:24	00:11:27	Beat up, then shut up.	N
115	00:11:28	00:11:31	You hitting every E.R. in town?	N
116	00:11:31	00:11:32	Seems like it.	N
117	00:11:33	00:11:38	These are all the jaw fractures that came in from two to three years ago. Thank you.	N
118	00:11:38	00:11:41	We don't get as many of these as we used to.	N
119	00:11:41	00:11:45	Domestic violence laws have forced men to get smarter about their hitting.	N
120	00:12:32	00:12:36	Why don't you, uh, you wait for me here, 'kay?	Y
121	00:12:38	00:12:40	Mr. Melton, take a seat.	Y
122	00:12:46	00:12:52	I married, uh, June about a year after Svetlana left.	Y
123	00:12:54	00:12:57	And when was the last time that you saw Svetlana?	Y
124	00:12:57	00:12:59	It was about two years ago.	N
125	00:12:59	00:13:01	She didn't come home one night.	N
126	00:13:02	00:13:05	Next thing I know, the cops are knocking down my door.	Y
127	00:13:05	00:13:09	I thought something happened to her, but they were there to arrest me.	Y
128	00:13:09	00:13:11	For hitting her.	N
129	00:13:11	00:13:12	Are you saying that you didn't?	Y
130	00:13:12	00:13:14	We were married for three years. I never hit her.	Y
131	00:13:14	00:13:16	Why would she lie? I don't know.	Y
132	00:13:19	00:13:21	And then what happened?	N
133	00:13:21	00:13:23	After that, I... I was done.	Y
134	00:13:24	00:13:26	I went looking for her to sign the divorce papers, but...	Y
135	00:13:27	00:13:29	it was like she fell off the face of the earth.	N
136	00:13:29	00:13:31	Or got buried a few feet under it.	N
137	00:13:31	00:13:35	Look, I took out ads in the newspaper every day for a month.	Y
138	00:13:35	00:13:36	She never responded.	N
139	00:13:36	00:13:40	Yet you didn't file a missing persons report.	Y
140	00:13:40	00:13:41	I'd been accused of abuse.	Y
141	00:13:41	00:13:45	How would that have looked? You seem to care a lot about the way things look, Mr. Melton.	Y
142	00:13:47	00:13:52	Well, we're gonna need a list of Svetlana's friends and family.	N
143	00:13:52	00:13:54	She didn't have any.	N
144	00:13:54	00:13:55	She spawned from nothingness?	N
145	00:13:55	00:13:59	Her parents died in some kind of industrial accident in Odessa.	N
146	00:13:59	00:14:01	Russia? Yeah.	N
147	00:14:01	00:14:03	How did the two of you meet?	Y
148	00:14:03	00:14:04	Through an agency.	N
149	00:14:04	00:14:05	Svetlana was a mail-order bride?	N
150	00:14:05	00:14:08	We were introduced through an agency.	Y
151	00:14:09	00:14:16	So what happened, the Russian agency denied your application for another wife, or, uh, you lost your taste for white meat?	Y
152	00:14:16	00:14:18	Too tough? You know what, lady?	N
153	00:14:18	00:14:22	I am not gonna feel bad about my decision.	Y
154	00:14:22	00:14:25	I dated American women, like you.	Y
155	00:14:25	00:14:31	They don't want to be anyone's wife, or mother-- you mention the word domestic, they're done with you.	N
156	00:14:31	00:14:34	It's nice to be needed...	N
157	00:14:34	00:14:35	not resented.	N
158	00:14:35	00:14:39	Yeah, I find isolation and dependency really sexy, too.	N
159	00:14:39	00:14:41	You know, what, you can think whatever you want.	N
160	00:14:51	00:14:55	Look, all I am asking is to have a black-and-white do regular welfare checks.	N
161	00:14:55	00:14:56	Did the wife ask for help?	N
162	00:14:56	00:15:00	Well, that's kind of hard to do when you don't speak English and you're a sex slave.	N
163	00:15:00	00:15:02	I'm sure she doesn't know her rights.	N
164	00:15:02	00:15:05	You can't arrest someone for marrying the wrong person.	N
165	00:15:05	00:15:07	You would know.	N
166	00:15:07	00:15:12	If the guy's an abuser, if he killed his first wife, we will build a case and we will nail him.	Y
167	00:15:12	00:15:15	And in the meantime, he can just keep using her as a punching bag.	Y
168	00:15:15	00:15:17	Sara, I was there-- there wasn't a mark on her.	N
169	00:15:17	00:15:20	Not that we could see, Catherine.	N
170	00:15:20	00:15:26	You know... every time we get a case with a hint of domestic violence or abuse, you go off the deep end.	N
171	00:15:26	00:15:33	What is your problem? Yeah, I probably do, and you let your sexuality cloud your judgment about men, and I'm gonna go over your head.	N
172	00:15:33	00:15:34	Sidle.	N
173	00:15:35	00:15:37	Get in my office. Now.	N
174	00:15:39	00:15:43	You are a law enforcement officer and a representative of this city.	N
175	00:15:43	00:15:48	That means I expect you to conduct yourself in an appropriate manner, in and away from this lab.	N
176	00:15:48	00:15:53	You know what, if this is gonna be one of your for the good of the lab speeches, don't bother, I've heard them.	N
177	00:15:53	00:15:56	Just take a seat.	N
178	00:15:56	00:15:59	Willows is a supervisor-- that means you treat her with respect.	N
179	00:15:59	00:16:01	Insulting her in front of coworkers...	N
180	00:16:01	00:16:03	She's not my supervisor.	N
181	00:16:03	00:16:05	All right-- your superior.	N
182	00:16:05	00:16:12	Sara, you berate witnesses, you disrespect the people you work with, you luck your way out of a DUI.	N
183	00:16:12	00:16:14	Take a look-- you got a half a dozen complaints in your jacket.	N
184	00:16:14	00:16:20	And if Grissom really documented your performance, there'd probably be a dozen more-- that's not the kind of person I want in my lab.	N
185	00:16:20	00:16:24	The only reason this is your lab is because Grissom doesn't kiss ass.	N
186	00:16:24	00:16:31	You couldn't hack it in the field, so you fail your way up, you break up our team, and now you just hang out in the hallways waiting for one of us to screw up.	N
187	00:16:31	00:16:35	Sidle, you're on one-week suspension without pay, and when you get back, Great.	N
188	00:16:35	00:16:37	you're apologizing to Catherine.	N
189	00:16:37	00:16:39	No, I'm not.	N
190	00:16:44	00:16:47	What's going on around here? ( groans )	N
191	00:16:47	00:16:49	I don't want to talk about it.	N
192	00:16:49	00:16:54	Okay, so, this is the jacket that Svetlana was wearing the night that she went into the hospital?	N
193	00:16:54	00:16:58	Yeah. I pulled it out of the vault from the original abuse charge two years ago.	N
194	00:16:58	00:17:03	Most of the blood is Svetlana's, although there is a small portion that comes from an unknown male.	N
195	00:17:03	00:17:06	So I'll see if the husband's willing to give us a comparison.	Y
196	00:17:06	00:17:11	Don't bother, he already voluntarily gave a sample the night that this happened, and it's not a match.	Y
197	00:17:11	00:17:12	So he was telling the truth?	Y
198	00:17:12	00:17:14	Eh...	N
199	00:17:14	00:17:18	I did find this... in her pocket.	N
200	00:17:18	00:17:20	Is that the husband?	Y
201	00:17:22	00:17:23	Nyet.	N
202	00:17:25	00:17:28	Well, they're looking pretty friendly here.	N
203	00:17:28	00:17:33	And you could write some teen poetry from the words that are highlighted in this dictionary.	N
204	00:17:33	00:17:39	Well, maybe Andrew found out that Svetlana wasn't as lonely as he thought she was.	Y
205	00:17:42	00:17:46	Catherine, I heard Ecklie suspended Sara.	N
206	00:17:46	00:17:48	What can we do? Nothing.	N
207	00:17:48	00:17:49	No? Mm-mm.	N
208	00:17:50	00:17:52	Sara's always been there for anyone who needs her.	N
209	00:17:52	00:17:53	She's always had my back.	N
210	00:17:53	00:17:55	So what if she flew off the handle a little?	N
211	00:17:55	00:18:01	Greg, she crossed the line with a suspect; she was inappropriate with me and with Ecklie; she needs the time off.	Y
212	00:18:03	00:18:05	A lot of blood on that blouse.	N
213	00:18:05	00:18:09	Yeah, well, her wounds don't just trickle, man, they-they gush.	N
214	00:18:09	00:18:12	Were you able to get anything off these jeans?	N
215	00:18:12	00:18:14	Uh, found this paper.	N
216	00:18:14	00:18:15	It was found in the pocket.	N
217	00:18:15	00:18:17	Decomp trashed it, though.	N
218	00:18:17	00:18:21	That reminds me of the time I as at the Ghost Bar, and I ran into this hottie.	N
219	00:18:21	00:18:23	I mean, the girls was an absolute dime.	N
220	00:18:23	00:18:28	And I didn't have my phone on me, so I wrote her number down on paper, and put it in my pants.	N
221	00:18:28	00:18:30	The jeans ended up in the wash.	N
222	00:18:30	00:18:31	Ouch. Yeah.	N
223	00:18:31	00:18:33	But...	N
224	00:18:36	00:18:37	Yeah.	N
225	00:18:37	00:18:40	Whoa...	N
226	00:18:40	00:18:43	Fatty acids dissolve the ink, and it leeches onto the pocket lining.	N
227	00:18:43	00:18:45	Yeah. Huh.	N
228	00:18:45	00:18:48	That must've been a pretty hot number you had there, boss.	N
229	00:18:48	00:18:50	Yeah, it was.	N
230	00:18:50	00:18:58	All right, first we mirror it, and then we remove the background texture of the cotton weave.	N
231	00:18:58	00:18:59	Sharpen the contrast, will you?	N
232	00:19:00	00:19:03	Madame...	N
233	00:19:03	00:19:05	Matryoshka's.	N
234	00:19:05	00:19:07	Tuesday...	N
235	00:19:07	00:19:09	g a.m.?	N
236	00:19:09	00:19:12	Some kind of appointment. g a.m.?	N
237	00:19:12	00:19:13	Do you know what matryoshkaare?	N
238	00:19:13	00:19:15	Sure.	N
239	00:19:15	00:19:17	Russian nesting dolls.	N
240	00:19:18	00:19:22	Oh, yeah, yeah, the dolls that look alike, that fit inside of each other, right?	N
241	00:19:22	00:19:23	My grandma had a set.	N
242	00:19:23	00:19:29	Anyway, people who've gone from writing Cyrillic to English often write their nines as lowercase G's.	N
243	00:19:41	00:19:43	You have appointment for haircut?	N
244	00:19:43	00:19:46	Nah, I'm trying to get a Rastafarian thing going.	N
245	00:19:48	00:19:51	Is there an actual Madame Matryoshka?	N
246	00:19:51	00:19:55	...polizia...	N
247	00:19:55	00:19:57	We're polizia. Yeah.	N
248	00:20:00	00:20:02	Chloe Daniels. What can I do for you?	N
249	00:20:02	00:20:04	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.	N
250	00:20:04	00:20:06	This is Nick Stokes from the Crime Lab.	N
251	00:20:06	00:20:07	We're here about Svetlana Melton.	N
252	00:20:07	00:20:09	Yeah, she used to work here.	N
253	00:20:09	00:20:10	In what capacity?	N
254	00:20:10	00:20:12	Hairdresser.	N
255	00:20:12	00:20:13	You mean wife-to-be.	N
256	00:20:13	00:20:14	Yeah.	N
257	00:20:14	00:20:15	For money?	N
258	00:20:15	00:20:16	Yeah.	N
259	00:20:16	00:20:18	Sounds a lot like prostitution to me.	N
260	00:20:18	00:20:19	Yeah, well, it's not.	N
261	00:20:21	00:20:23	Look, I didn't invent this.	N
262	00:20:23	00:20:27	Go on line-- there are dozens of sites with thousands of women.	N
263	00:20:27	00:20:29	They advertise these exciting trips to Kiev.	N
264	00:20:29	00:20:32	I just bring Kiev to you.	N
265	00:20:32	00:20:36	I sponsor 90-day work visas, teach the girls a trade.	N
266	00:20:36	00:20:37	They cut hair for men.	N
267	00:20:37	00:20:39	So men shop for a wife.	Y
268	00:20:39	00:20:40	You screen the guys?	Y
269	00:20:40	00:20:43	You pick up a woman at a bar, does the bartender screen you?	N
270	00:20:43	00:20:45	You take her home, take her to your bed.	N
271	00:20:45	00:20:47	How well did you screen her?	N
272	00:20:47	00:20:49	You should be sainted.	N
273	00:20:49	00:20:51	Mm, I don't know about that.	N
274	00:20:51	00:20:54	Svetlana ended up dead.	N
275	00:20:54	00:20:57	You recognize this guy?	N
276	00:20:57	00:20:58	Yeah. Ken Wellstone.	N
277	00:20:58	00:21:00	Lives down the street.	N
278	00:21:00	00:21:01	Actually comes in for haircuts.	N
279	00:21:01	00:21:03	Isn't interested in my service.	N
280	00:21:03	00:21:05	Not the marrying kind, I guess.	N
281	00:21:05	00:21:09	Yeah, I-I'm sorry, there seems to be a really fine line here between, uh...	N
282	00:21:09	00:21:12	peddling marriage and peddling flesh.	N
283	00:21:12	00:21:14	When is marriage anything else?	N
284	00:21:14	00:21:15	Nick is, uh...	N
285	00:21:15	00:21:16	he's an old-fashioned guy.	N
286	00:21:17	00:21:18	Really? ( laughs )	N
287	00:21:19	00:21:21	Well, what do you think engagement rings are?	N
288	00:21:21	00:21:24	Just proof that a man can pay for his bride.	N
289	00:21:24	00:21:28	Look, caveman would go steal a woman from a neighboring clan.	N
290	00:21:28	00:21:31	He'd tie her hands and her feet till she wouldn't run away.	N
291	00:21:31	00:21:37	Once she'd stay put, he would only tie her finger, just to remind her.	N
292	00:21:37	00:21:39	So you're a romantic.	N
293	00:21:39	00:21:40	Marriage is not romance.	N
294	00:21:40	00:21:43	It's a contract with the state.	N
295	00:21:43	00:21:44	It's an investment in your future.	N
296	00:21:45	00:21:48	I'm not making it about money, it just is.	N
297	00:21:52	00:21:55	Uh, she cut my hair.	N
298	00:21:55	00:21:58	She licked your cone.	N
299	00:21:58	00:22:02	Well, I-I took Svetlana out once for... for ice cream.	N
300	00:22:02	00:22:04	It was... it was a hot day.	N
301	00:22:04	00:22:06	That's it? Yeah, that's it.	N
302	00:22:06	00:22:11	She, uh, gave me some sob story about how she was married to some abusive guy, you know, and how, uh...	Y
303	00:22:11	00:22:14	She begged me to help, and...	N
304	00:22:15	00:22:16	blah, blah, blah, blah.	N
305	00:22:16	00:22:18	I don't... I don't need that kind of drama.	N
306	00:22:18	00:22:20	Mr. Wellstone, what do you do for a living?	N
307	00:22:20	00:22:22	I'm a real estate agent.	N
308	00:22:22	00:22:23	You're not in construction or anything?	N
309	00:22:24	00:22:26	No. Why?	N
310	00:22:28	00:22:30	Something happen to Svetlana?	N
311	00:22:30	00:22:31	Yeah, she was murdered.	N
312	00:22:33	00:22:36	Oh.	N
313	00:22:36	00:22:40	We're gonna need to get a DNA sample from you, and I'm gonna take a look around your place.	N
314	00:22:40	00:22:43	Is that cool? Sure. Yeah, go ahead.	N
315	00:23:40	00:23:43	Well, if you're here, it can't be good.	N
316	00:23:43	00:23:45	Can I come in?	N
317	00:23:46	00:23:48	Want to ask me if I'm drunk?	N
318	00:23:49	00:23:53	We both know that's not your problem.	N
319	00:23:53	00:23:55	I spoke to Catherine.	N
320	00:23:57	00:23:58	Ecklie?	N
321	00:23:59	00:24:00	He wants me to fire you.	N
322	00:24:00	00:24:01	I figured.	N
323	00:24:03	00:24:05	Can I get you anything?	N
324	00:24:05	00:24:08	Sure. An explanation.	N
325	00:24:08	00:24:12	I... lost my temper.	N
326	00:24:12	00:24:15	That seems to be happening quite a bit.	N
327	00:24:15	00:24:18	Do you know why?	N
328	00:24:18	00:24:19	What difference does it make?	N
329	00:24:19	00:24:21	I'm still fired.	N
330	00:24:22	00:24:24	It makes a difference to me.	N
331	00:24:26	00:24:29	I have a problem with authority.	N
332	00:24:29	00:24:32	I choose men who are emotionally unavailable.	N
333	00:24:32	00:24:34	I'm self-destructive.	N
334	00:24:34	00:24:36	All of the above.	N
335	00:24:36	00:24:39	Have you ever gone a week without a rationalization?	N
336	00:24:42	00:24:43	It's from The Big Chill.	N
337	00:24:43	00:24:53	One of the characters explaining a basic fact of life-- that rationalizations are more important to us than sex even.	N
338	00:24:53	00:24:56	I am not rationalizing anything.	N
339	00:24:56	00:25:01	I crossed the line with Catherine, and I was insubordinate to Ecklie.	N
340	00:25:01	00:25:03	Why?	N
341	00:25:03	00:25:05	Leave it alone.	N
342	00:25:05	00:25:06	No, Sara.	N
343	00:25:08	00:25:09	What do you want from me?	N
344	00:25:09	00:25:12	I want to know why you're so angry.	N
345	00:25:17	00:25:19	It's funny...	N
346	00:25:19	00:25:22	the things that you remember and the things that you don't, you know.	N
347	00:25:22	00:25:27	There was a smell of iron in the air.	N
348	00:25:27	00:25:31	Cast-off on the bedroom wall.	N
349	00:25:31	00:25:36	There was this young cop puking his guts.	N
350	00:25:36	00:25:40	I remember the woman who took me to foster care.	N
351	00:25:40	00:25:42	I can't remember her name.	N
352	00:25:42	00:25:48	Which is strange, you know, 'cause I couldn't let go of her hand.	N
353	00:25:52	00:25:56	Well... the mind has its filters.	N
354	00:25:56	00:26:01	I do remember the looks.	N
355	00:26:01	00:26:05	I became the girl whose father was stabbed to death.	N
356	00:26:10	00:26:12	Do you think there's a murder gene?	N
357	00:26:15	00:26:19	I don't believe that genes are a predictor of violent behavior.	N
358	00:26:21	00:26:25	You wouldn't know that in my house.	N
359	00:26:25	00:26:28	The fights, the yelling, the trips to the hospital.	N
360	00:26:28	00:26:31	I thought it was the way that everybody lived.	N
361	00:26:31	00:26:42	When my mother killed my father, I found out that it wasn't.	N
362	00:27:30	00:27:35	So the tar from your carpet matches the tar that Svetlana Melton was buried in.	N
363	00:27:35	00:27:36	Tar... I... where?	N
364	00:27:36	00:27:39	I mean, I have no idea what you're talking about.	N
365	00:27:39	00:27:42	We also found your blood on her parka that she wore to the hospital two years ago.	N
366	00:27:42	00:27:43	I can explain that. That was from...	N
367	00:27:43	00:27:46	So can we-- you beat her, you killed her, you buried her.	N
368	00:27:46	00:27:47	No, I didn't.	N
369	00:27:47	00:27:49	No, stop, please.	N
370	00:27:49	00:27:52	She... she ran away.	N
371	00:28:00	00:28:02	Put that in here.	N
372	00:28:03	00:28:05	Ken, do not look for me.	N
373	00:28:05	00:28:06	I need to go away.	N
374	00:28:06	00:28:08	Svetlana.	N
375	00:28:08	00:28:13	You know, after everything that we'd been through and everything, this just seemed really, uh...	N
376	00:28:13	00:28:14	It was cold.	N
377	00:28:14	00:28:15	Didn't sound like her.	N
378	00:28:15	00:28:17	She usually called me...	N
379	00:28:17	00:28:19	Kenski.	N
380	00:28:19	00:28:21	So what was your relationship, Kenski?	N
381	00:28:21	00:28:22	What was my relationship?	N
382	00:28:22	00:28:24	My relationship was, uh...	N
383	00:28:28	00:28:30	We were, uh... we were in love.	N
384	00:28:30	00:28:32	How did her husband feel about that?	Y
385	00:28:32	00:28:35	Her husband bought her, so he thought he owned her.	Y
386	00:28:35	00:28:36	And Svetlana was way out of his league.	Y
387	00:28:36	00:28:39	And what she wanted to do was fast track her divorce.	N
388	00:28:39	00:28:46	So she thought maybe if she made it look like Andrew had beat her, that that would do it, but that didn't do it because he'd actually never hit her. So...	Y
389	00:28:46	00:28:48	How'd she break her jaw?	N
390	00:28:51	00:28:53	Huh?	N
391	00:28:56	00:28:59	She begged me.	N
392	00:28:59	00:29:03	Please, Kenski. Please.	N
393	00:29:03	00:29:06	Hit me hard on face.	N
394	00:29:06	00:29:10	It is only way for me to leave this horrible man.	Y
395	00:29:10	00:29:12	Please, Kenski.	N
396	00:29:12	00:29:15	Hit me if you love me.	N
397	00:29:28	00:29:30	I just loved her.	N
398	00:29:44	00:29:49	All of the blood on Svetlana's sweatshirt was hers.	N
399	00:29:49	00:29:50	Nothing from Ken Wellstone?	N
400	00:29:50	00:29:58	No, but some of the drops look a lot like dried blood, but they came back Aubergine Sheen number 315, professional grade hair dye.	N
401	00:29:59	00:30:01	Well, she worked in a hair salon.	N
402	00:30:01	00:30:03	Some of the patterns look a lot like cast-off.	N
403	00:30:04	00:30:07	Hair dye was present when she was being attacked.	N
404	00:30:07	00:30:09	Ken still could have done it.	N
405	00:30:09	00:30:12	True, but his story is so absurd I almost buy it.	N
406	00:30:12	00:30:14	Yeah, well, admit the punch and you go to jail for a night.	N
407	00:30:14	00:30:16	Admit the killing and you go to jail for life.	N
408	00:30:17	00:30:18	Find anything you like, buddy?	N
409	00:30:19	00:30:22	So, you can't sell your kids, but you can buy their mother.	N
410	00:30:22	00:30:26	I looking for kindest, noble man.	N
411	00:30:26	00:30:28	Well, I got news for you, sugar pants.	N
412	00:30:29	00:30:30	Buying women ain't that noble.	N
413	00:30:30	00:30:31	Well, life is short.	N
414	00:30:31	00:30:32	Dating's complicated.	N
415	00:30:32	00:30:34	This makes it much simpler, doesn't it?	N
416	00:30:35	00:30:37	It's not supposed to be simple.	N
417	00:30:37	00:30:39	Complicated is the whole point.	N
418	00:30:39	00:30:40	It is? Yeah.	N
419	00:30:40	00:30:42	Hey, wait a minute.	N
420	00:30:42	00:30:44	You're not telling me you're into this stuff?	N
421	00:30:44	00:30:45	Me? No.	N
422	00:30:45	00:30:54	But you know, for a guy who's over 40, lonely, tired of the bar scene, got a little cash, wants to buy himself a sweet honey, be his companion...	N
423	00:30:54	00:30:57	He needs a translator, 'cause you're not even speaking the same language.	N
424	00:30:57	00:30:58	That's the best part.	N
425	00:30:58	00:31:00	Ugh...!	N
426	00:31:02	00:31:04	Best part of what?	N
427	00:31:04	00:31:07	What's all this about?	N
428	00:31:07	00:31:10	We have reason to believe Svetlana Melton was murdered in your salon.	N
429	00:31:10	00:31:12	We have a search warrant.	N
430	00:31:15	00:31:17	Let them in.	N
431	00:31:37	00:31:41	Jagged on one side, smooth on the other.	N
432	00:32:03	00:32:07	I got blood spatter next to the hair dye.	N
433	00:32:07	00:32:09	Svetlana was a tall girl.	N
434	00:32:09	00:32:12	Spatter looks a little low.	N
435	00:32:12	00:32:14	Maybe she was sitting.	N
436	00:32:14	00:32:16	These chairs don't match.	N
437	00:32:21	00:32:24	I think somebody's hiding something.	N
438	00:32:29	00:32:35	The stain on the chair was Aubergine Sheen Number Four hair dye.	N
439	00:32:35	00:32:40	DNA from the bloodstains on the walls was too degraded, and Mia could not get a match.	N
440	00:32:40	00:32:42	So, we know who the blood belongs to.	N
441	00:32:42	00:32:44	We just can't prove it.	N
442	00:32:44	00:32:45	I think we can, though.	N
443	00:32:45	00:32:55	You know some guy was selling a grilled cheese sandwich on eBay for something like $20,000 because he claimed the burn pattern contained the face of the Virgin Mary?	N
444	00:32:59	00:33:04	How much you think I can get for the face of Svetlana in hair dye?	N
445	00:33:10	00:33:11	Hang on.	N
446	00:33:11	00:33:14	There's something else.	N
447	00:33:19	00:33:21	A recycled love token.	N
448	00:33:21	00:33:23	Now, that's tacky.	N
449	00:33:23	00:33:24	Yeah, that is pretty tacky.	N
450	00:33:25	00:33:26	But it's cause for a warrant.	N
451	00:33:36	00:33:38	Everything in order?	N
452	00:33:39	00:33:42	I'm not giving you a damn thing until I read every last word.	Y
453	00:33:42	00:33:44	Take as long as you want. We're going to be here a while.	Y
454	00:33:46	00:33:49	Do you believe this?	N
455	00:33:49	00:33:52	What, that the guy locks up his food?	Y
456	00:33:54	00:33:57	Locks his wife out.	Y
457	00:33:57	00:33:59	You think he's trying to protect his investment?	Y
458	00:33:59	00:34:01	Weight goes up. Value goes down.	N
459	00:34:01	00:34:04	Control her food, control her destiny, I don't know.	N
460	00:34:04	00:34:06	Look at this.	N
461	00:34:06	00:34:08	She can't even call out for pizza.	N
462	00:34:08	00:34:10	Or help.	N
463	00:34:13	00:34:15	The necklace.	N
464	00:34:16	00:34:17	No, no, no. No, no. I got it.	N
465	00:34:17	00:34:20	I got it.	N
466	00:35:04	00:35:10	Svetlana's blood was on the necklace worn by Andrew Melton's current child bride.	Y
467	00:35:10	00:35:15	Could you imagine a control freak like him having to spend the night in jail on a phony abuse charge?	Y
468	00:35:15	00:35:17	You know he went looking for her when he got out.	Y
469	00:35:27	00:35:29	It'll never stand up, Rick.	N
470	00:35:29	00:35:33	You know how it is, they'll say the blood could've come from anywhere.	N
471	00:35:33	00:35:35	She could've left the necklace behind.	N
472	00:35:35	00:35:37	We need a murder weapon.	N
473	00:35:37	00:35:38	Yeah, well, good luck on that one.	N
474	00:35:38	00:35:41	Crime's over two years old.	N
475	00:35:41	00:35:42	All righty.	N
476	00:35:42	00:35:44	We know that this guy did it.	Y
477	00:35:44	00:35:45	How do we prove it?	N
478	00:35:45	00:35:47	Can we prove he buried her?	Y
479	00:35:47	00:35:49	I'm not convinced he did.	Y
480	00:35:49	00:35:52	Svetlana was buried in a pre- existing grave.	N
481	00:35:52	00:35:54	Right on top of Jane Doe Bottom.	N
482	00:35:54	00:35:58	And both girls' fingertips were removed by blending shears.	N
483	00:35:58	00:35:59	Which we also found at the salon.	N
484	00:35:59	00:36:05	And the only people with full access to the salon are Chloe and Vlad.	N
485	00:36:05	00:36:10	Yeah, and Chloe doesn't really seem like the type that gets her hands dirty.	N
486	00:36:10	00:36:22	All right, the relative size of the letters and the spacing between them appear to be consistent with both Vlad's appointment book and the good-bye note left by Svetlana.	N
487	00:36:22	00:36:24	My opinion is it's the same writer.	N
488	00:36:24	00:36:29	Well, it looks like the Vladski tricked the Kenski.	N
489	00:36:29	00:36:38	According to your credit card statements, you purchased several buckets of tar two and five years ago...	N
490	00:36:38	00:36:40	at a local hardware store.	N
491	00:36:40	00:36:45	Tell me, what's a receptionist at a hair salon doing with that much tar?	N
492	00:36:45	00:36:47	In Russia, I work for certain family.	N
493	00:36:47	00:36:52	When they want body taken care of, I go to oil field, dump body in tar.	N
494	00:36:52	00:36:54	None ever found.	N
495	00:36:55	00:36:57	Sounds like fun.	N
496	00:36:57	00:36:59	Tell me about Svetlana.	N
497	00:36:59	00:37:02	Girl already dead. Nothing I can do.	N
498	00:37:02	00:37:04	So you're saying you did not kill her?	N
499	00:37:04	00:37:06	No.	N
500	00:37:06	00:37:08	Then why'd you cover it up?	N
501	00:37:08	00:37:11	Svetlana, time to lock up.	N
502	00:37:13	00:37:15	You didn't call 911?	N
503	00:37:15	00:37:24	You cleaned up the scene, buried her, and then you left a note for Ken.	N
504	00:37:24	00:37:28	America is land of opportunity.	N
505	00:37:28	00:37:30	Her death should be a total loss?	N
506	00:37:31	00:37:35	Andrew Melton is very good tipper.	Y
507	00:37:35	00:37:40	Was Andrew Melton a very good tipper five years ago?	Y
508	00:37:42	00:37:44	No.	N
509	00:37:44	00:37:47	Svetlana wasn't buried alone.	N
510	00:37:47	00:37:49	There was another body in that grave.	N
511	00:37:49	00:37:52	Many girls want American husband.	N
512	00:37:52	00:37:55	Sometimes Chloe can't get them a visa.	N
513	00:37:55	00:37:58	They come anyway...	N
514	00:38:07	00:38:16	She came here in a suitcase, but she was dead on arrival, so you take her out to the desert and bury her in a hole?	N
515	00:38:24	00:38:27	Again, girl already dead.	N
516	00:38:27	00:38:29	Nothing I can do.	N
517	00:38:35	00:38:39	Boy, women can really drive you crazy, huh?	Y
518	00:38:39	00:38:43	I mean, this perfect creature who needs you, who loves you.	Y
519	00:38:43	00:38:46	You think you've got it all worked out.	Y
520	00:38:46	00:38:52	Your Christmas card's gonna look like the Sears catalogue, right?	Y
521	00:38:52	00:38:54	And then what?	N
522	00:38:54	00:38:55	I mean, you give her stuff.	Y
523	00:38:55	00:39:01	You give her clothes, money and shelter, and then she goes and makes up some bogus story about how you attacked her.	Y
524	00:39:01	00:39:02	Which I never did.	Y
525	00:39:05	00:39:07	Man...	N
526	00:39:07	00:39:09	a love like that.	N
527	00:39:09	00:39:11	So pure.	N
528	00:39:11	00:39:17	I mean, men have robbed banks for less, put their life on the line...	N
529	00:39:17	00:39:19	would kill to protect it.	N
530	00:39:21	00:39:29	Everywhere we went, men were making love to her with their eyes, defiling her with their thoughts.	Y
531	00:39:29	00:39:36	It got so bad it wasn't safe to let her leave the house.	N
532	00:39:36	00:39:41	But then she got lonely.	N
533	00:39:41	00:39:43	Like a person I didn't recognize.	Y
534	00:39:43	00:39:46	You made her an American.	Y
535	00:39:46	00:39:48	In all the good ways...	N
536	00:39:49	00:39:52	...and the bad.	N
537	00:39:54	00:39:55	Svetlana!	N
538	00:39:57	00:39:58	You told them I hit you?!	Y
539	00:39:58	00:40:00	Why would you do that? Huh?	N
540	00:40:01	00:40:02	Is that what you want?	Y
541	00:40:02	00:40:04	Huh? You want me to hit you?!	Y
542	00:40:07	00:40:10	That you want?!	N
543	00:40:12	00:40:16	She never appreciated me.	Y
544	00:40:25	00:40:27	Andrew, what happens?	Y
545	00:40:27	00:40:28	Andrew?	Y
546	00:40:29	00:40:30	It'll be okay, honey.	N
547	00:40:30	00:40:32	It'll all work out.	N
548	00:40:33	00:40:34	You'll see.	N
549	00:40:39	00:40:40	You wanted to talk to me about Sara?	N
550	00:40:41	00:40:43	I haven't received her disciplinary action.	N
551	00:40:43	00:40:44	What's the holdup?	N
552	00:40:44	00:40:46	Well, I'm not firing her.	N
553	00:40:50	00:40:51	What action are you taking?	N
554	00:40:51	00:40:54	I've taken it.	N
555	00:40:54	00:40:56	I thought I was clear.	N
556	00:40:56	00:40:57	You were.	N
557	00:40:57	00:40:59	Now let me be clear.	N
558	00:40:59	00:41:02	Sara's behavior is a direct result of my management.	N
559	00:41:02	00:41:03	So I should fire you.	N
560	00:41:03	00:41:05	But you won't.	N
561	00:41:06	00:41:08	Look, Gil...	N
562	00:41:08	00:41:10	I've been there. We're human.	N
563	00:41:10	00:41:13	We get attached to people, we try to fix their problems.	N
564	00:41:13	00:41:14	It doesn't work.	N
565	00:41:14	00:41:16	She's a great criminalist, Conrad.	N
566	00:41:17	00:41:18	And I need her.	N
567	00:41:18	00:41:20	I'm sure you do.	N
568	00:41:20	00:41:23	You know what?	N
569	00:41:23	00:41:25	She's a loose cannon with a gun.	N
570	00:41:26	00:41:27	And she's all yours.	N
