0	00:00:08	00:00:09	Five! Baby, go!	N
1	00:00:09	00:00:11	Seven. Whoo!	N
2	00:00:28	00:00:30	Changing $100.	N
3	00:00:30	00:00:32	Change $100, go ahead.	N
4	00:00:44	00:00:46	Section G-3, all clear.	N
5	00:00:46	00:00:49	En route to H-4 then Soft Count.	Y
6	00:01:17	00:01:18	Section G-4.	N
7	00:01:18	00:01:20	Security Three intersect at G-5.	Y
8	00:01:20	00:01:22	Contain! Contain!	Y
9	00:01:34	00:01:35	And the body count?	Y
10	00:01:35	00:01:37	Five guards, three civilians wounded.	Y
11	00:01:37	00:01:38	One dead bad guy.	Y
12	00:01:38	00:01:44	Armed robbers snatched the lock boxes from the two high-stakes tables right off the rolling cage.	Y
13	00:01:44	00:01:45	Cash on wheels.	Y
14	00:01:45	00:01:47	Busiest time of night.	Y
15	00:01:47	00:01:49	Three women-- organized and muscled.	Y
16	00:01:49	00:01:50	Small time crooks, Jim.	N
17	00:01:50	00:01:53	Hey, they got away with 250 K.	N
18	00:01:53	00:01:56	That's a mere pittance to a Vegas casino.	Y
19	00:01:56	00:01:59	Cashiers alone are sitting on a million and change.	N
20	00:01:59	00:02:03	Small time or not these ladies are dangerous.	N
21	00:02:06	00:02:08	Dangerous, yes.	N
22	00:02:08	00:02:10	Ladies...	N
23	00:02:12	00:02:13	no.	N
24	00:02:58	00:03:02	These guys packed enough .45 caliber ammo for a small army.	N
25	00:03:02	00:03:05	Security managed to return a few rounds.	N
26	00:03:05	00:03:06	Nine millimeter.	N
27	00:03:06	00:03:10	Less than a year ago security couldn't even carry guns.	Y
28	00:03:10	00:03:12	Times have changed.	N
29	00:03:12	00:03:13	Yeah.	N
30	00:03:14	00:03:16	The same M.O. as Laughlin.	N
31	00:03:16	00:03:20	Last month, Cottage Casino, men dressed as women shot the place to hell.	Y
32	00:03:20	00:03:21	In and out in under five.	Y
33	00:03:21	00:03:23	My bet was that that was the practice run.	Y
34	00:03:23	00:03:25	And the more you practice...	N
35	00:03:25	00:03:27	I don't know what the hell's going on with the world.	Y
36	00:03:27	00:03:29	Everything's crazy.	Y
37	00:03:29	00:03:30	I risk my life just coming into work.	N
38	00:03:30	00:03:32	Makes you miss the mob days, huh?	N
39	00:03:32	00:03:34	Back then, this never would've happened.	Y
40	00:03:34	00:03:40	And if it did, those scumbags, they'd be dead, every last one of them and we would never know about it.	Y
41	00:03:40	00:03:44	Mister... Mr. Duncan-- take a deep breath and tell us what happened.	N
42	00:03:44	00:03:48	We'd just made a money transfer to the rolling cages.	Y
43	00:03:48	00:03:51	Then, bang-- the chandelier comes crashing down.	Y
44	00:03:51	00:03:53	Sounded like an explosion.	Y
45	00:03:53	00:03:56	So I dropped to my knees-- took cover.	Y
46	00:03:56	00:03:57	Anything else?	N
47	00:03:57	00:04:00	Yeah, I started praying for the gunfire to stop.	N
48	00:04:00	00:04:01	Okay. Thanks a lot.	N
49	00:04:01	00:04:05	And check in with triage before you leave.	Y
50	00:04:06	00:04:08	Well, that was helpful.	N
51	00:04:08	00:04:11	Actually, it was.	Y
52	00:04:11	00:04:14	Gives us a starting point.	N
53	00:04:14	00:04:16	The falling chandelier distracts the guards.	N
54	00:04:16	00:04:17	Makes them easy targets.	N
55	00:04:19	00:04:22	The armed robbers load up, head for the exits...	N
56	00:04:22	00:04:24	Quick escape.	N
57	00:04:24	00:04:29	Chaos moving in one direction the money moving in the other.	N
58	00:04:35	00:04:38	Can you imagine living out here?	N
59	00:04:38	00:04:39	It's peaceful.	N
60	00:04:39	00:04:41	Peaceful?	N
61	00:04:41	00:04:43	The town just lost five percent of its population.	N
62	00:04:43	00:04:47	I thought you said this was a single homicide.	N
63	00:04:47	00:04:50	Yeah, in a population of 20.	Y
64	00:04:52	00:04:53	We made it.	N
65	00:04:53	00:04:54	State trooper.	N
66	00:05:07	00:05:10	Two hours to drive 75 miles.	N
67	00:05:10	00:05:13	You guys got lost.	Y
68	00:05:13	00:05:14	What's the rush?	Y
69	00:05:14	00:05:17	Crime scene's not going anywhere.	Y
70	00:05:17	00:05:18	Yeah, but I am.	Y
71	00:05:18	00:05:20	Body's behind the counter.	Y
72	00:05:20	00:05:23	Dustin Bale-- store clerk.	Y
73	00:05:23	00:05:24	Bullet through the chest.	Y
74	00:05:24	00:05:25	The register's empty.	Y
75	00:05:25	00:05:28	Officer Spencer... did you touch anything?	N
76	00:05:28	00:05:29	14 years as a state trooper.	N
77	00:05:29	00:05:32	I know how to secure a crime scene without contaminating the evidence.	N
78	00:05:32	00:05:34	Sorry.	N
79	00:05:34	00:05:36	It's okay.	N
80	00:05:36	00:05:38	Look, I cover 97.5 square miles.	N
81	00:05:38	00:05:39	I got to book.	N
82	00:06:01	00:06:02	Vomit?	N
83	00:06:08	00:06:10	Not an expectorate.	N
84	00:06:10	00:06:11	Potato.	N
85	00:06:11	00:06:12	Blown to smithereens.	N
86	00:06:12	00:06:15	A poor man's silencer.	N
87	00:06:18	00:06:23	Now, why would an assailant need a silencer way out here?	N
88	00:06:41	00:06:45	Last paying customer-- eight hours ago.	N
89	00:06:45	00:06:47	We just got the call.	N
90	00:06:47	00:06:49	The place is open 24/seven.	N
91	00:06:49	00:06:51	Why'd it take so long?	N
92	00:06:51	00:06:56	The assailant flipped the sign on the way out buying him time to get away.	N
93	00:06:58	00:07:03	But now without getting his picture taken first.	N
94	00:07:16	00:07:18	It's plastic.	Y
95	00:07:18	00:07:20	You're joking.	Y
96	00:07:21	00:07:24	Nine volt attached to a blinking light.	Y
97	00:07:24	00:07:29	Real or fake, it didn't work.	Y
98	00:07:29	00:07:31	There was three of them.	N
99	00:07:31	00:07:38	They come from around the corner, guns drawn I think they came from over there.	N
100	00:07:38	00:07:39	There were two of them.	N
101	00:07:39	00:07:42	I said four.	N
102	00:07:42	00:07:44	There were four of those lunatics.	N
103	00:07:44	00:07:45	They were everywhere.	N
104	00:07:45	00:07:46	Right.	N
105	00:07:46	00:07:47	Write it down.	N
106	00:07:47	00:07:48	I got it. Thank you very much.	N
107	00:07:48	00:07:49	Excuse me.	N
108	00:07:51	00:07:52	I've interviewed 17 people.	N
109	00:07:52	00:07:54	No two accounts are alike.	N
110	00:07:54	00:07:56	A Harvard professor conducted an experiment.	N
111	00:07:56	00:08:00	Asked a bunch of students to watch a basketball game-- count the number of times the ball was passed.	N
112	00:08:00	00:08:02	Yeah. Groundbreaking.	N
113	00:08:02	00:08:06	During the game a person dressed in a gorilla suit ran across the court.	N
114	00:08:06	00:08:10	Afterwards, the professor asked his students if they noticed the gorilla.	N
115	00:08:10	00:08:12	50% responded, What gorilla?	N
116	00:08:12	00:08:13	That's wonderful, Gil.	Y
117	00:08:13	00:08:15	If I see a gorilla, I'll arrest it.	Y
118	00:08:17	00:08:20	The car was sitting right here.	N
119	00:08:20	00:08:21	Did you get a good look at it?	N
120	00:08:21	00:08:23	Make, model?	N
121	00:08:23	00:08:25	No. It was beige, beat up.	N
122	00:08:25	00:08:27	Hazards flashing.	N
123	00:08:27	00:08:29	People leave their cars here all the time.	N
124	00:08:29	00:08:31	I wait ten minutes then call for a tow.	N
125	00:08:31	00:08:33	Car peel out?	N
126	00:08:33	00:08:35	No. The driver gunned it but I didn't hear a screech.	N
127	00:08:45	00:08:47	Smells like burnt wood.	Y
128	00:08:47	00:08:49	Motor oil?	Y
129	00:08:49	00:08:52	No. No, transmission fluid.	Y
130	00:08:52	00:08:55	But it's brown, not red.	N
131	00:08:55	00:08:56	Which means?	N
132	00:08:56	00:08:59	It's not the right color.	N
133	00:09:03	00:09:06	Extraction is an art, Albert.	N
134	00:09:06	00:09:09	I like to think so.	N
135	00:09:09	00:09:11	So this is our cross-dresser in the blue coat?	Y
136	00:09:11	00:09:12	I.D.'d as Adam Brower.	Y
137	00:09:12	00:09:16	Shot in the back with a hollow point-- close range.	N
138	00:09:16	00:09:20	Mushroomed upon impact maximizing trauma.	N
139	00:09:23	00:09:24	Caliber?	N
140	00:09:24	00:09:27	Forty-five.	N
141	00:09:27	00:09:31	The guards were armed with nine millimeters and they weren't hollow point.	N
142	00:09:31	00:09:33	so...	N
143	00:09:33	00:09:36	he was shot in the back by one of his own partners?	N
144	00:09:36	00:09:38	Someone didn't want to share.	N
145	00:09:44	00:09:47	Wow. A fumette.	N
146	00:09:47	00:09:49	Did you get that out of some museum?	N
147	00:09:49	00:09:50	Hey, don't knock it.	N
148	00:09:50	00:09:53	It's still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.	N
149	00:09:55	00:09:57	Blow and print.	N
150	00:09:57	00:10:03	If you were in a hurry how would you get back there?	N
151	00:10:03	00:10:06	Easy.	N
152	00:10:06	00:10:07	Jump the counter.	N
153	00:10:07	00:10:10	Exactly what I'm thinking.	N
154	00:10:49	00:10:51	Shoe prints.	N
155	00:10:51	00:10:53	Lay it out.	Y
156	00:10:53	00:10:55	Suspect entered...	N
157	00:10:58	00:11:00	shoots the clerk through the potato...	Y
158	00:11:02	00:11:05	then hops up and over, leaving behind shoe prints...	Y
159	00:11:05	00:11:07	grabs the cash...	N
160	00:11:07	00:11:10	flips the sign from open to closed and exits.	N
161	00:11:10	00:11:12	How old is the killer?	Y
162	00:11:12	00:11:14	What are you thinking?	Y
163	00:11:14	00:11:17	Shoe size is five, six tops.	Y
164	00:11:17	00:11:20	We may be looking for a minor.	Y
165	00:11:20	00:11:22	You want to see me?	Y
166	00:11:22	00:11:23	Yeah.	N
167	00:11:23	00:11:26	This is the video surveillance from the heist.	N
168	00:11:26	00:11:30	This camera was trained on their entrance.	Y
169	00:11:30	00:11:33	All the disguises in the world and they dress like women.	Y
170	00:11:33	00:11:36	Ski masks are played out.	Y
171	00:11:36	00:11:41	Red and Blue teamed up together and took out the guards in the rolling cage.	Y
172	00:11:41	00:11:43	Black shot down that chandelier.	N
173	00:11:43	00:11:47	Well, Blue's the decedent I.D.'d as Adam Brower...	Y
174	00:11:47	00:11:49	so enlarge Red.	N
175	00:11:51	00:11:55	No amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk of Adam's apple.	N
176	00:11:55	00:11:58	That must be the one that killed Brower.	N
177	00:11:58	00:12:00	.45 in the back at close range.	N
178	00:12:03	00:12:06	No honor among thieves.	N
179	00:12:06	00:12:08	Photoshop Black.	N
180	00:12:10	00:12:12	No stubble...	N
181	00:12:12	00:12:14	no Adam's apple.	N
182	00:12:14	00:12:19	Dressed as a woman among men dressed as women.	N
183	00:12:19	00:12:22	Now, see? That's a disguise.	N
184	00:12:31	00:12:33	Fluorescent powders?	N
185	00:12:33	00:12:36	Eh, why not? They're in the kit.	N
186	00:12:36	00:12:38	Protocol's black.	N
187	00:12:38	00:12:40	Since when do you care about my choice of powders?	N
188	00:12:40	00:12:46	Assistant coroner is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body.	N
189	00:12:46	00:12:48	And I haven't even heard from Grissom.	N
190	00:12:48	00:12:52	I've never tried green. I should never have been sent to this remote scene in the first place.	N
191	00:12:52	00:12:57	I've got seniority. I deserve-- no, I've earnedthe right to pick my cases.	N
192	00:13:06	00:13:08	If I start eating, I will shut up.	N
193	00:13:11	00:13:12	Do you have a mirror?	N
194	00:13:12	00:13:15	Since when do you care about your appearance?	N
195	00:13:18	00:13:20	I mean at a crime scene.	N
196	00:13:20	00:13:23	It's not for me.	N
197	00:13:23	00:13:24	Sorry.	N
198	00:13:27	00:13:29	We can't touch it.	N
199	00:13:29	00:13:30	I'm just getting a better look.	N
200	00:13:39	00:13:41	Oh, thank God. It's about time.	N
201	00:13:41	00:13:44	Nice to see you, too, Catherine.	N
202	00:13:44	00:13:45	Well, I smell the body.	N
203	00:13:45	00:13:47	Where is he? Hey, David.	N
204	00:13:47	00:13:48	I wasn't touching him.	N
205	00:13:48	00:13:50	I know you better than that.	N
206	00:13:50	00:13:51	So, uh, what took you so long?	N
207	00:13:51	00:13:54	I made a wrong turn back at the fork.	N
208	00:14:04	00:14:06	You're a surfer now?	N
209	00:14:06	00:14:08	Dude, I rip.	N
210	00:14:08	00:14:12	We're 300 miles from the nearest beach.	N
211	00:14:12	00:14:15	Surfing's just a state of mind.	N
212	00:14:15	00:14:16	I got your page.	N
213	00:14:16	00:14:17	Where's my report?	N
214	00:14:17	00:14:18	Oh, relax, bro.	N
215	00:14:18	00:14:20	The GC Mass Spec's working on it.	N
216	00:14:20	00:14:21	Should be done, um...	N
217	00:14:23	00:14:24	now.	N
218	00:14:25	00:14:27	Transmission fluid.	N
219	00:14:27	00:14:30	Yeah, thanks.	N
220	00:14:30	00:14:34	Type F with Dexron.	N
221	00:14:34	00:14:36	So...	N
222	00:14:36	00:14:39	you should be reading Car &amp; Driver instead of Sand and Surf.	N
223	00:14:39	00:14:43	Someone put the wrong type of fluid in the car's transmission.	Y
224	00:14:43	00:14:47	See, Ford automobiles use a thick, red, Type F transmission fluid.	Y
225	00:14:47	00:14:51	General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with Dexron.	Y
226	00:14:51	00:14:54	Now, when Dexron's put into a Ford it thins that Type F fluid.	Y
227	00:14:54	00:14:56	Friction builds, gears grind.	N
228	00:14:56	00:14:59	The second gear is usually the first to go.	N
229	00:14:59	00:15:04	Friction causes the engine to overheat, in turn cooking the transmission fluid turning it brown.	N
230	00:15:04	00:15:07	Leak on the pavement is the first clue you've got a problem.	N
231	00:15:07	00:15:10	Congratulations-- you're looking for a Ford with a leak.	Y
232	00:15:10	00:15:12	Not just a Ford.	N
233	00:15:12	00:15:15	The getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear.	N
234	00:15:15	00:15:17	Which means it can't get very far.	N
235	00:15:17	00:15:19	My guess is it's already been dumped.	N
236	00:15:19	00:15:27	Before Mr. Brower dressed up as a woman and heisted a casino he was a janitor at an office park off Flamingo.	Y
237	00:15:27	00:15:30	Before that, he was out of town.	N
238	00:15:30	00:15:32	Fours years, grand larceny.	N
239	00:15:34	00:15:36	Well, the manager's not in?	N
240	00:15:36	00:15:38	I got a warrant.	Y
241	00:15:38	00:15:39	I got a key.	Y
242	00:15:47	00:15:49	Whoo, tidy little camper, isn't he?	N
243	00:15:49	00:15:52	Yeah.	N
244	00:15:59	00:16:00	What are we looking for?	N
245	00:16:00	00:16:03	Anything that links Brower to his co-conspirators.	N
246	00:16:14	00:16:15	Dirty laundry?	N
247	00:16:15	00:16:20	I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before the heist.	N
248	00:16:21	00:16:24	I'm going to take it all back to the lab.	N
249	00:16:24	00:16:26	Okay.	N
250	00:16:28	00:16:30	Let's see here...	N
251	00:16:46	00:16:49	Well, while you're at it don't forget his wigs and bras.	N
252	00:17:17	00:17:19	Anything on the shoe print?	Y
253	00:17:19	00:17:21	Skechers. Adult size five.	Y
254	00:17:21	00:17:22	Female.	N
255	00:17:22	00:17:24	Well, at least we're not chasing a kid.	N
256	00:17:24	00:17:26	How's the prints coming?	N
257	00:17:26	00:17:27	You two lifted 82 suspect prints.	Y
258	00:17:27	00:17:29	43 are partial.	Y
259	00:17:29	00:17:32	We ID'd one from the open/closed sign.	Y
260	00:17:32	00:17:33	Great. Not so great.	Y
261	00:17:33	00:17:35	State trooper.	Y
262	00:17:35	00:17:36	You got to be kidding me.	Y
263	00:17:36	00:17:38	Officer Moron contaminated the scene.	Y
264	00:17:38	00:17:42	Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain.	N
265	00:17:42	00:17:44	Tough. I like that.	N
266	00:17:45	00:17:47	Match.	Y
267	00:17:47	00:17:48	Print off the register.	Y
268	00:17:48	00:17:49	What have you got?	N
269	00:17:53	00:17:55	Tammy Felton.	N
270	00:17:55	00:17:56	Who's Tammy Felton?	N
271	00:17:56	00:18:02	A fugitive and clinical psychopath that Grissom and I put behind bars.	Y
272	00:18:02	00:18:04	She tried to play me but I didn't bite.	Y
273	00:18:10	00:18:14	Her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them.	N
274	00:18:14	00:18:15	Biological parents?	N
275	00:18:15	00:18:18	Tammy was kidnapped as a child.	N
276	00:18:18	00:18:20	Raised by her kidnapper.	N
277	00:18:20	00:18:23	When she found out the truth, she killed him.	N
278	00:18:27	00:18:29	Hey, finish running the prints.	N
279	00:18:30	00:18:32	Tammy uses people.	N
280	00:18:32	00:18:33	She wasn't alone.	N
281	00:18:34	00:18:36	Grissom!	N
282	00:18:36	00:18:40	If you're going to badger me about your crime scene location, put it in a memo.	N
283	00:18:40	00:18:42	You don't read memos.	N
284	00:18:42	00:18:43	Do you remember Tammy Felton?	N
285	00:18:43	00:18:45	I always remember the ones that get away.	N
286	00:18:45	00:18:46	She's back.	N
287	00:18:47	00:18:49	She's been to Cal Nev Ari.	Y
288	00:18:49	00:18:52	She's a prime suspect in our convenience store homicide.	Y
289	00:18:52	00:18:55	Grissom... I need you, ASAP.	N
290	00:18:55	00:18:57	Please.	Y
291	00:19:00	00:19:04	So, Ballistics sent me a bullet from the casino.	Y
292	00:19:04	00:19:08	It's a .45, so we know it came from one of the ladies' guns.	Y
293	00:19:08	00:19:10	And this is a special bullet?	N
294	00:19:10	00:19:13	No, but there was a foreign substance adhered to it.	Y
295	00:19:13	00:19:14	And the substance is special?	Y
296	00:19:14	00:19:16	Not exactly.	N
297	00:19:16	00:19:18	Just get to the point, Greg.	N
298	00:19:18	00:19:20	Tomato, to-mah-to, potato...	Y
299	00:19:20	00:19:21	Wait a second.	Y
300	00:19:21	00:19:23	There was potato on the bullet?	Y
301	00:19:23	00:19:25	You bet.	Y
302	00:19:25	00:19:27	Strange, huh?	N
303	00:19:27	00:19:31	There was potato on the bullet because there was potato inside the barrel of the gun.	Y
304	00:19:31	00:19:33	This bullet is from myinvestigation.	N
305	00:19:33	00:19:34	Right.	N
306	00:19:34	00:19:41	One of your armed robbers may have used a potato as a silencer prior to the heist.	N
307	00:19:45	00:19:47	Tammy Felton?	N
308	00:19:47	00:19:48	Maybe.	Y
309	00:19:48	00:19:51	Three armed robbers.	Y
310	00:19:51	00:19:55	Adam Brower-- killed at the scene Tammy Felton...	N
311	00:19:55	00:19:58	We're still one suspect short.	N
312	00:19:58	00:20:01	Cath, got another match from the convenience store.	N
313	00:20:01	00:20:04	The print on the outside doorknob belongs to an ex-con, Darin Hanson.	Y
314	00:20:09	00:20:12	You know this guy, too?	N
315	00:20:12	00:20:14	He ran with Tammy's father.	N
316	00:20:14	00:20:16	Mostly from the law.	N
317	00:20:16	00:20:18	So Tammy kills Dad...	N
318	00:20:18	00:20:21	and she and Darin Hanson run off together.	N
319	00:20:26	00:20:28	A regular Bonnie and Clyde.	N
320	00:20:28	00:20:30	Just what Vegas needs.	N
321	00:20:35	00:20:37	Let me see, Bobby.	N
322	00:20:37	00:20:38	Yeah.	N
323	00:20:38	00:20:41	Projectile on the left, .45 hollow point courtesy of Adam Brower's back.	N
324	00:20:41	00:20:47	On the right a .45 hollow point extracted from Dustin Bale-- dead clerk at the convenience store.	N
325	00:20:47	00:20:50	Bullets confirm the story told by the potato.	N
326	00:20:50	00:20:52	Same gun. Two crimes. One case.	N
327	00:20:52	00:20:54	Three suspects.	N
328	00:20:54	00:20:55	Adam Brower, deceased.	N
329	00:20:55	00:20:58	Tammy Felton, Darin Hanson, still at large.	N
330	00:20:58	00:20:59	Hey, guys.	N
331	00:20:59	00:21:01	I just got a call from Brass.	N
332	00:21:01	00:21:04	We got a possible getaway vehicle off I-93.	N
333	00:21:04	00:21:06	What makes you think it's the right car?	N
334	00:21:06	00:21:09	It's beige abandoned, '77 Mercury Cougar.	N
335	00:21:09	00:21:12	Mercury's a division of Ford.	N
336	00:21:12	00:21:13	I'll drive.	N
337	00:21:29	00:21:30	A trucker called it in.	N
338	00:21:30	00:21:35	Well, if that's the getaway car there would have been a secondary vehicle parked nearby.	N
339	00:21:35	00:21:37	Yeah. Check for treads, Jim?	N
340	00:21:37	00:21:40	Yeah.	N
341	00:21:40	00:21:41	Shall we?	N
342	00:21:41	00:21:43	Let's go.	N
343	00:21:56	00:21:59	If you were stashing a car, where would you hide it?	Y
344	00:21:59	00:22:02	All these bushes would provide good cover.	Y
345	00:22:04	00:22:05	Oh...	N
346	00:22:05	00:22:08	check out that dirt displacement.	N
347	00:22:08	00:22:09	Yeah.	N
348	00:22:09	00:22:12	Skid mark; one tire.	N
349	00:22:16	00:22:19	Where's the other one?	N
350	00:22:19	00:22:21	There isn't one.	Y
351	00:22:26	00:22:31	Dirt to pavement then the trail goes cold.	Y
352	00:22:33	00:22:35	No damage. This car was barely moving.	N
353	00:22:35	00:22:37	It was dumped.	N
354	00:22:38	00:22:39	Detail...	Y
355	00:22:39	00:22:42	pop the trunk.	Y
356	00:22:47	00:22:49	Thanks.	Y
357	00:22:54	00:22:57	It's Tammy.	N
358	00:23:01	00:23:04	Contusions on the anterior neck.	N
359	00:23:04	00:23:08	Streaking erythema on the lateral aspect of zone one.	Y
360	00:23:08	00:23:10	Cartilaginous tracheal rings are crushed.	N
361	00:23:10	00:23:13	Hey, Doc.	N
362	00:23:13	00:23:14	Catherine.	N
363	00:23:16	00:23:19	She didn't put up a fight, did she?	N
364	00:23:19	00:23:20	How'd you know?	Y
365	00:23:20	00:23:23	She was killed by the one person in life she trusted.	Y
366	00:23:34	00:23:39	Darin Hanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming.	N
367	00:23:39	00:23:42	Put his thumbs around her air pipe and pushed.	N
368	00:23:46	00:23:48	I swabbed her neck.	N
369	00:23:48	00:23:50	Affirmative for epithelials.	N
370	00:23:50	00:23:54	I'll run them against Darin Hanson's DNA.	N
371	00:23:54	00:23:56	Parents called. They're on their way in to I.D.	Y
372	00:23:56	00:23:59	How did they sound?	N
373	00:23:59	00:24:02	Oddly, relieved.	N
374	00:24:03	00:24:06	They finally know where she is.	N
375	00:24:16	00:24:18	I'm not pulling it.	N
376	00:24:18	00:24:21	I found similar dust on Adam Brower's dirty clothes.	N
377	00:24:21	00:24:23	Check it out.	N
378	00:24:30	00:24:32	Real-life fairy dust.	N
379	00:24:32	00:24:35	Yeah, it turns grown men into criminals.	N
380	00:24:35	00:24:37	What's the composition?	N
381	00:24:37	00:24:38	S-I...	N
382	00:24:38	00:24:41	O-2. Silica dust.	N
383	00:24:41	00:24:44	Each particle's a hundred times smaller than a grain of sand.	N
384	00:24:44	00:24:47	I thought you guys were processing the car.	N
385	00:24:47	00:24:50	Yeah, um... what do you know about silica?	N
386	00:24:50	00:24:52	It's used to make glass.	N
387	00:24:52	00:24:53	It's mined in open pits. Why?	N
388	00:24:53	00:24:57	Silica found both on Adam Brower's clothing and the getaway vehicle.	N
389	00:24:57	00:25:01	There's an abandoned silica mine outside Cal Nev Ari.	N
390	00:25:01	00:25:02	What don'tyou know?	N
391	00:25:44	00:25:46	Come here.	N
392	00:25:51	00:25:54	Motorcycle tracks at the vehicle dump site.	N
393	00:26:08	00:26:11	Yeah, that smells nice.	N
394	00:26:11	00:26:13	Shouldn't smell at all, if this place is abandoned.	Y
395	00:26:21	00:26:24	Get your guns out.	Y
396	00:26:39	00:26:42	Say hello to Darin Hanson.	Y
397	00:26:47	00:26:50	Shot with a .45.	N
398	00:26:52	00:26:53	Execution style.	N
399	00:26:53	00:26:55	Adam, Tammy...	N
400	00:26:55	00:26:57	now Darin... all dead.	N
401	00:26:57	00:26:59	And we're out of suspects.	N
402	00:27:01	00:27:05	Three robbers hold up the casino.	N
403	00:27:05	00:27:10	Tammy was in black, Adam was the one in blue and that leaves us Darin.	N
404	00:27:10	00:27:13	We found Darin and Tammy's prints at the convenience store.	Y
405	00:27:13	00:27:15	Hours before the heist, the clerk gets murdered.	N
406	00:27:17	00:27:21	Shot with the same gun used to kill Adam at the casino.	N
407	00:27:21	00:27:26	The surveillance video tells us that Darin was the only one in position to shoot Adam.	N
408	00:27:28	00:27:29	Why did Darin kill Adam?	N
409	00:27:29	00:27:31	Greed.	N
410	00:27:31	00:27:33	Fewer slices. Bigger pieces.	N
411	00:27:33	00:27:36	Which explains why he killed Tammy.	Y
412	00:27:38	00:27:39	That's confirmed?	N
413	00:27:39	00:27:43	Epithelials on her neck are a match to Darin's DNA.	Y
414	00:27:43	00:27:46	So, Darin thought he was getting the whole score.	Y
415	00:27:46	00:27:47	But now he's dead.	N
416	00:27:47	00:27:50	So, who killed him, and where's the money?	N
417	00:27:50	00:27:55	And we still don't know why Darin and Tammy took out the convenience store clerk.	N
418	00:27:55	00:27:59	Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you're about to steal a few hundred thousand?	Y
419	00:27:59	00:28:01	We've got more questions than answers.	N
420	00:28:01	00:28:06	I just got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI assigned to last month's Cottage Casino case.	N
421	00:28:06	00:28:11	He told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants, not three.	N
422	00:28:11	00:28:14	Maybe Tower Club surveillance missed something.	N
423	00:28:14	00:28:17	Actually, it didn't. Wedid.	Y
424	00:28:17	00:28:18	Tower Casino surveillance.	Y
425	00:28:18	00:28:23	The screen on your left the camera's trained over where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered.	Y
426	00:28:23	00:28:28	The screen on your right is trained on the gaming tables.	Y
427	00:28:28	00:28:31	Okay, check it out.	Y
428	00:28:34	00:28:35	What are we looking for?	Y
429	00:28:35	00:28:38	What, you missed him? All right...	Y
430	00:28:38	00:28:40	I'll play it again...	Y
431	00:28:40	00:28:42	slower, just for you.	Y
432	00:28:42	00:28:49	Now, keep your eye trained on the pit boss and the chandelier.	Y
433	00:28:51	00:28:53	He ducked before the chandelier fell.	Y
434	00:28:53	00:28:55	Yeah, before Tammy drew her gun.	Y
435	00:28:55	00:28:56	Play it again.	N
436	00:29:02	00:29:03	Well done, Warrick.	N
437	00:29:03	00:29:05	You found our mole.	Y
438	00:29:05	00:29:08	Pit boss' name is Max Duncan.	Y
439	00:29:08	00:29:11	Started working there about three weeks ago.	Y
440	00:29:11	00:29:12	Before that...	Y
441	00:29:12	00:29:13	Let me guess.	Y
442	00:29:13	00:29:15	Laughlin, Cottage Casino?	Y
443	00:29:17	00:29:18	I'll call Brass.	Y
444	00:29:18	00:29:19	He can make the arrest.	Y
445	00:29:19	00:29:21	I'll meet him at the station.	Y
446	00:29:21	00:29:23	Call you with an update.	Y
447	00:29:39	00:29:40	Max Duncan?	N
448	00:29:40	00:29:42	Yeah. What the hell is going on here?	Y
449	00:29:42	00:29:44	You going somewhere?	Y
450	00:29:46	00:29:49	I'll ask the questions; you give the answers downtown.	Y
451	00:29:49	00:29:51	I'm calling my lawyer.	Y
452	00:29:53	00:29:54	Good idea.	Y
453	00:29:56	00:30:00	Max... are you clairvoyant?	Y
454	00:30:00	00:30:01	Excuse me?	N
455	00:30:01	00:30:04	Surveillance tape from the Tower Club Casino.	Y
456	00:30:04	00:30:07	You ducked before there was a reason to cover.	N
457	00:30:07	00:30:10	I saw a gun; I hit the ground.	N
458	00:30:10	00:30:12	Okay, let's try this.	Y
459	00:30:12	00:30:14	Why were you leaving town?	Y
460	00:30:14	00:30:16	Trying to beat a murder rap?	Y
461	00:30:16	00:30:19	I didn't kill anyone.	Y
462	00:30:19	00:30:21	You forget about Darin Hanson?	Y
463	00:30:21	00:30:26	Your car was covered with gray dust-- silica.	Y
464	00:30:26	00:30:28	It places you at the murder scene.	N
465	00:30:28	00:30:30	I didn't kill him.	N
466	00:30:30	00:30:31	Max... I went there, but ...	N
467	00:30:31	00:30:33	I'm advising you not to say another word.	N
468	00:30:33	00:30:35	No, I want to clear this up.	N
469	00:30:35	00:30:38	All right, I went out to the mine, but I didn't kill Darin.	Y
470	00:30:38	00:30:40	He was already dead.	Y
471	00:30:41	00:30:48	All right, look, I... I'll admit I helped him out.	Y
472	00:30:48	00:30:50	I... I told him when and where to hit.	Y
473	00:30:50	00:30:52	That's why I ducked.	Y
474	00:30:52	00:30:54	But that's it.	N
475	00:30:54	00:30:55	That's a lot.	Y
476	00:30:55	00:30:59	And it still doesn't explain why you went to see Darin.	Y
477	00:30:59	00:31:01	Max, that is enough.	Y
478	00:31:01	00:31:03	Well, I went to collect my share...	N
479	00:31:03	00:31:07	but the money was gone Darin was dead, and I panicked.	N
480	00:31:07	00:31:09	But I didn't shoot him.	N
481	00:31:09	00:31:11	You can't get me for murder on this.	N
482	00:31:11	00:31:17	When someone is killed during a commission of a felony all the conspirators are liable.	N
483	00:31:17	00:31:21	Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower but you might as well have pulled the trigger.	N
484	00:31:24	00:31:26	Let's make a deal.	N
485	00:31:26	00:31:29	Tell me, who else was involved?	N
486	00:31:29	00:31:30	Who killed Darin?	N
487	00:31:30	00:31:35	Look, Darin was the only one that I spoke to.	N
488	00:31:35	00:31:38	I never even met the other three.	N
489	00:31:38	00:31:40	Then we got no deal.	N
490	00:31:40	00:31:42	Officer.	N
491	00:31:43	00:31:44	Let's go.	N
492	00:31:55	00:31:58	You know what? I kind of believe him.	Y
493	00:31:58	00:32:00	Yeah, me, too.	Y
494	00:32:00	00:32:02	He confirmed a fourth.	Y
495	00:32:02	00:32:04	Darin plus three.	Y
496	00:32:04	00:32:05	Just like Laughlin.	Y
497	00:32:05	00:32:08	So, the last man standing killed Darin.	N
498	00:32:08	00:32:10	And he's still out there...	N
499	00:32:10	00:32:15	flushed with cash and a .45 caliber.	N
500	00:32:15	00:32:17	Surveillance stills from the Laughlin heist.	N
501	00:32:17	00:32:21	Darin, Tammy and Adam.	N
502	00:32:21	00:32:22	All deceased.	Y
503	00:32:22	00:32:24	Yeah. All murdered.	Y
504	00:32:24	00:32:25	That leaves one.	Y
505	00:32:25	00:32:30	I.D. the Unknown Laughlin and Vegas.	Y
506	00:32:30	00:32:32	Except all we got is a guy in drag.	N
507	00:32:32	00:32:35	Well, that's why I'm here.	N
508	00:32:36	00:32:43	I've divided the photo into segments removed the disguise and rebuilt the original image based on male physiological norms.	N
509	00:32:43	00:32:48	Now, it's not exact but you'll have an idea of what your guy looks like.	N
510	00:32:55	00:32:57	That's Dustin Bale.	N
511	00:32:57	00:32:59	The clerk from the convenience store.	N
512	00:32:59	00:33:00	Whoa. Hold on.	N
513	00:33:00	00:33:03	He was killed hours before the Tower Club heist.	N
514	00:33:03	00:33:06	In on Laughlin, out on Vegas.	N
515	00:33:06	00:33:09	So, Darin took him out first.	N
516	00:33:09	00:33:12	They cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery.	N
517	00:33:12	00:33:15	But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three.	N
518	00:33:15	00:33:17	Because he knew there were four at the Laughlin heist.	N
519	00:33:17	00:33:20	Well, maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there.	N
520	00:33:20	00:33:22	He wasn't counting wigs.	N
521	00:33:22	00:33:24	He was hiding under a blackjack table.	N
522	00:33:24	00:33:27	And we're back to who killed Darin Hanson.	N
523	00:33:29	00:33:30	Bobby D.	N
524	00:33:30	00:33:31	Yeah?	N
525	00:33:31	00:33:33	We need your help.	N
526	00:33:33	00:33:36	Another round from the casino heist?	N
527	00:33:36	00:33:38	Indirectly, yeah.	N
528	00:33:41	00:33:43	Well, tip didn't blossom.	N
529	00:33:43	00:33:47	Not a hollow point, so it's not from Darin Hanson's gun.	N
530	00:33:47	00:33:48	No, it's from his head.	N
531	00:33:50	00:33:55	All right, 230 grains gives us a .45 automatic.	N
532	00:33:55	00:33:56	What else?	N
533	00:33:56	00:34:07	Okay, normally, lands and grooves are highly delineated but these are smooth, polished-- which means that your projectile was fired from a polygonal barrel.	N
534	00:34:07	00:34:09	Be right back.	Y
535	00:34:14	00:34:18	These are the only types of .45 automatics with polygonal barrels.	Y
536	00:34:18	00:34:24	So, the gun that fired your bullet was either a Heckler &amp; Koch USP or a Glock.	Y
537	00:34:28	00:34:31	Narrow it further.	Y
538	00:34:33	00:34:35	dissecting your bullet.	N
539	00:34:35	00:34:37	Hey, Nick. Mm-hmm.	N
540	00:34:37	00:34:40	Count the stripes.	Y
541	00:34:40	00:34:44	One, two, three four, five, six.	Y
542	00:34:44	00:34:47	Six lands and grooves Mm-hmm. with a right-hand twist.	Y
543	00:34:47	00:34:50	Glock's got eight; Heckler and Koch-- six.	Y
544	00:34:50	00:34:51	You got your gun.	Y
545	00:34:51	00:34:54	Let's run ATF.	Y
546	00:34:54	00:34:57	Pretty unique weapon.	N
547	00:34:57	00:34:58	Expensive.	N
548	00:34:58	00:35:01	Not exactly what you'd buy out of the back of a van.	Y
549	00:35:06	00:35:07	Only take a second.	Y
550	00:35:09	00:35:12	See? Can I call it?	Y
551	00:35:12	00:35:14	Only 18 registered in-state.	Y
552	00:35:14	00:35:18	Ten in Clark County; seven of them still in circulation.	Y
553	00:35:22	00:35:24	Any names jumping off the page?	Y
554	00:35:24	00:35:25	Just one.	Y
555	00:35:25	00:35:28	It's out of left field.	N
556	00:35:28	00:35:31	About 75 miles out.	Y
557	00:35:39	00:35:41	You're accusing me of murder.	N
558	00:35:41	00:35:44	And absconding with a quarter of a mil, stolen money.	Y
559	00:35:44	00:35:45	Where did you stash the cash?	Y
560	00:35:45	00:35:48	I'm a state trooper.	Y
561	00:35:48	00:35:50	How does a cop hook up with an ex-con like Darin?	Y
562	00:35:50	00:35:52	I can answer that.	Y
563	00:35:52	00:35:54	It's all in a day's work.	Y
564	00:36:03	00:36:07	A potato silencer muffles a bullet but won't silence it.	Y
565	00:36:07	00:36:10	You went in your gun drawn.	N
566	00:36:12	00:36:15	Take it easy, pal.	N
567	00:36:15	00:36:17	You should have arrested them.	N
568	00:36:17	00:36:19	But something happened, didn't it?	N
569	00:36:19	00:36:22	My bet, Tammy made you an offer.	N
570	00:36:22	00:36:23	Drop the weapon.	N
571	00:36:23	00:36:27	Hey, uh, let's be smart about this.	N
572	00:36:27	00:36:31	You can take us in or we can cut you in.	N
573	00:36:35	00:36:38	They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job.	N
574	00:36:38	00:36:41	They offered you a finder's fee.	N
575	00:36:43	00:36:44	This isn't going to do it.	N
576	00:36:44	00:36:47	It'll hold you over... till tomorrow.	N
577	00:36:49	00:36:50	Deal?	N
578	00:37:02	00:37:04	What are you doing?	N
579	00:37:06	00:37:10	You patrol 97.5 square miles.	Y
580	00:37:10	00:37:14	Is the Cal Nev Ari Mine a part of your jurisdiction?	Y
581	00:37:14	00:37:16	No. I'm east of the mine.	N
582	00:37:16	00:37:19	But you've been there haven't you?	N
583	00:37:36	00:37:38	Where is the cash?	Y
584	00:37:38	00:37:40	Jim, hit the overhead, will you?	Y
585	00:37:45	00:37:47	Silica is a crystal.	N
586	00:37:47	00:37:48	It reflects the light.	N
587	00:37:48	00:37:51	Even trace amounts will show up.	Y
588	00:37:53	00:37:55	How about that?	N
589	00:39:13	00:39:16	More than I'd make in a lifetime.	N
590	00:39:16	00:39:18	Was it worth it?	N
591	00:39:18	00:39:21	You wouldn't understand.	N
592	00:39:21	00:39:22	That's right.	N
593	00:39:22	00:39:24	We make the big bucks.	N
594	00:39:24	00:39:28	Look-- I was never thatguy.	N
595	00:39:28	00:39:33	You know, that guy that wins the jackpots gets promoted, catches the breaks?	N
596	00:39:33	00:39:35	It was right there.	N
597	00:39:35	00:39:37	Yeah, well, you're still not that guy.	N
598	00:39:37	00:39:38	Get him out of here.	N
599	00:39:47	00:39:50	$250,000 turned a career cop bad.	N
600	00:39:50	00:39:51	Yeah, well, he had his price.	N
601	00:39:53	00:39:56	We all do.	N
