11	11	11	00:01:51	00:01:54	She was running hard from somewhere.	N

13	13	13	00:04:52	00:04:56	The engine's running, no flat tires.	N
14	14	14	00:04:56	00:04:58	Why'd she stop?	N
15	15	15	00:05:29	00:05:31	If you could just push.	N

23	23	23	00:06:11	00:06:14	I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.	N
24	24	24	00:06:14	00:06:17	I know that you've been through a horrific ordeal.	N
25	25	25	00:06:19	00:06:20	4-4-6.	N
26	26	26	00:06:22	00:06:24	That's all I got.	N
27	27	27	00:06:24	00:06:26	Nevada plates.	N
28	28	28	00:06:26	00:06:28	Some kind of SUV.	N
29	29	29	00:06:28	00:06:29	Black, I think.	N
30	30	30	00:06:29	00:06:33	Can you start from the beginning?	N
31	31	31	00:06:36	00:06:39	I was, um, driving home from work.	N
32	32	32	00:06:39	00:06:46	There's hardly any traffic once you cross Horizon Ranch.	N
33	33	33	00:06:46	00:06:49	He was tailgating.	N
34	34	34	00:06:49	00:06:54	I slowed down to let him pass and he hit me.	N
35	35	35	00:06:54	00:07:01	I wasn't going to stop, but he did, so I pulled over.	N
36	36	36	00:07:03	00:07:06	You're not supposed to leave the scene of an accident.	N
37	37	37	00:07:08	00:07:10	He looked like a normal guy.	N
38	38	38	00:07:10	00:07:12	He asked if I was okay.	N
39	39	39	00:07:12	00:07:14	Apologized.	N
40	40	40	00:07:14	00:07:17	He went to his car to get his insurance information.	N
41	41	41	00:07:17	00:07:20	I was looking at my bumper.	N
42	42	42	00:07:20	00:07:25	He punched me in the face, threw me over his shoulder.	N
43	43	43	00:07:25	00:07:28	I lost my shoes.	N
44	44	44	00:07:29	00:07:35	He threw me on the ground, took off my jacket, ripped open my shirt.	N
45	45	45	00:07:35	00:07:40	He kept trying to kiss me on the mouth, and I kept turning away.	N
46	46	46	00:07:40	00:07:41	So he bit my ear.	N
47	47	47	00:07:47	00:07:50	He wanted me to look at him.	N
48	48	48	00:07:50	00:07:51	He was going to kill me.	N
49	49	49	00:07:52	00:07:56	He ripped off my skirt.	N
50	50	50	00:07:56	00:07:59	He raped me.	N
51	51	51	00:07:59	00:08:01	He didn't use a condom.	N
52	52	52	00:08:01	00:08:08	He got up to zip, and I kicked him in the groin and I ran.	N
53	53	53	00:08:08	00:08:10	And the rest, I guess you know.	N
54	54	54	00:08:12	00:08:15	Thank you.	N
55	55	55	00:08:15	00:08:18	That was very specific.	N
56	56	56	00:08:18	00:08:21	You said that you looked at him.	N
57	57	57	00:08:21	00:08:23	Could you describe him to a forensic artist?	N
58	58	58	00:08:23	00:08:26	Yes.	N
59	59	59	00:08:29	00:08:32	What do you remember most about the face?	N
60	60	60	00:08:35	00:08:38	He had bright eyes.	N
61	61	61	00:08:38	00:08:40	What about the shape of the eyes?	N
62	62	62	00:08:40	00:08:44	Almond.	N
63	63	63	00:08:44	00:08:46	Tiny pupils.	N
64	64	64	00:08:46	00:08:48	What about the rest of the face?	N
65	65	65	00:08:48	00:08:52	He had a baby face.	N
66	66	66	00:08:52	00:08:58	High forehead, thin lips, clean-shaven.	N
67	67	67	00:08:58	00:09:01	Like a crewcut?	N
68	68	68	00:09:01	00:09:04	No, like he had a regular haircut.	N
69	69	69	00:09:09	00:09:10	What?	N
70	70	70	00:09:10	00:09:14	How many vacation days do you have on the books?	N
71	71	71	00:09:14	00:09:18	About ten weeks, I guess.	N
72	72	72	00:09:18	00:09:19	Why?	N
73	73	73	00:09:19	00:09:22	I think you should take a week or two.	N
74	74	74	00:09:22	00:09:25	I'm still on the case.	N
75	75	75	00:09:25	00:09:28	I just didn't do the interview for once in my life.	N
76	76	76	00:09:32	00:09:34	When was the last time you took vacation?	N
77	77	77	00:09:34	00:09:36	Never, right?	N
78	78	78	00:09:40	00:09:41	Okay.	N
79	79	79	00:10:18	00:10:22	Grissom, I have some information that will be of use to you.	N
80	80	80	00:10:22	00:10:25	But before you get it, I need a decision.	N
81	81	81	00:10:25	00:10:26	What?	N
82	82	82	00:10:26	00:10:28	I'm tired of being on the fence here.	N
83	83	83	00:10:28	00:10:31	Either I'm in the lab or I'm in the field.	N
84	84	84	00:10:33	00:10:34	Which is it?	N
85	85	85	00:10:34	00:10:39	Well, as soon as you can find and train a replacement, you can be in the field.	N
86	86	86	00:10:39	00:10:40	Until then, I need you in the lab.	N
87	87	87	00:10:41	00:10:42	Now give.	N
88	88	88	00:10:42	00:10:45	I got a CODIS hit off the semen from your victim.	N
89	89	89	00:10:45	00:10:49	DNA matches a rape-murder case from a year ago.	N
90	90	90	00:10:49	00:10:50	Still open?	N
91	91	91	00:10:50	00:10:51	Warrick's pulling the file.	N
92	92	92	00:10:51	00:10:53	Thanks.	N
93	93	93	00:10:53	00:10:55	No, thank you.	N
94	94	94	00:10:57	00:11:01	Victim was a 32- year-old Caucasian female, Emma Dobbins.	N
95	95	95	00:11:02	00:11:03	Sexually assaulted.	N
96	96	96	00:11:03	00:11:05	Cause of death, strangulation.	N
97	97	97	00:11:05	00:11:08	They used her pantyhose.	N
98	98	98	00:11:08	00:11:09	Where'd they find the body?	N
99	99	99	00:11:09	00:11:12	Off of Blue Diamond Road, southern highlands.	N
100	100	100	00:11:12	00:11:15	That's not far from where Linley Parker was assaulted.	N
101	101	101	00:11:16	00:11:20	Other than the semen, the only evidence at the scene was a shoe print-- man's size nine.	N
102	102	102	00:11:20	00:11:21	I talked to Nick.	N
103	103	103	00:11:21	00:11:23	They also found a print-- size nine.	N
104	104	104	00:11:23	00:11:25	Did she have a car?	N
105	105	105	00:11:25	00:11:28	A vintage Pontiac.	N
106	106	106	00:11:28	00:11:29	Registered in her name, never recovered.	N
107	107	107	00:11:30	00:11:35	So apart from geography and age, what else did they have in common?	N
108	108	108	00:11:35	00:11:39	Emma Dobbins ran a movie memorabilia place downtown.	N
109	109	109	00:11:39	00:11:42	My vic was a pit boss at the Monaco.	N
110	110	110	00:11:42	00:11:43	Emma was married.	N
111	111	111	00:11:43	00:11:45	Linley Parker was single.	N
112	112	112	00:11:45	00:11:47	Blonde. She was brunette.	N
113	113	113	00:11:47	00:11:50	The only thing in common, the guy who raped them.	N
114	114	114	00:12:00	00:12:03	There's something wrong with the nose.	N
115	115	115	00:12:05	00:12:07	Which one looks right.	N
116	116	116	00:12:07	00:12:09	That one.	N
117	117	117	00:12:09	00:12:11	This one?	N
118	118	118	00:12:17	00:12:24	Now, close your eyes, and tell me everything that happened up until the point that he raped you.	N
119	119	119	00:12:34	00:12:36	Yeah, look at me.	N
120	120	120	00:12:37	00:12:40	Open your eyes.	N
121	121	121	00:12:51	00:12:55	My husband keeps dropping hints about my anniversary present.	N
122	122	122	00:12:55	00:12:58	Says he hopes I like calypso music.	N
123	123	123	00:12:58	00:13:01	I think it's a cruise.	N
124	124	124	00:13:01	00:13:03	You don't like cruises?	N
125	125	125	00:13:03	00:13:05	I feel guilty.	N
126	126	126	00:13:05	00:13:11	Because you don't love him anymore, or because you think he can't handle knowing?	N
127	127	127	00:13:11	00:13:13	Dr. Todd Coombs.	N
128	128	128	00:13:13	00:13:15	Excuse me, I'm with a patient.	N
129	129	129	00:13:15	00:13:16	Honey, I told him...	N
130	130	130	00:13:16	00:13:17	Crystal, what's going on here?	N
131	131	131	00:13:17	00:13:19	Las Vegas Police.	N
132	132	132	00:13:19	00:13:21	Sir, we need to talk.	N
133	133	133	00:13:22	00:13:25	This is insane-- you've got the wrong guy.	N
134	134	134	00:13:25	00:13:28	Well, if that's true, you got nothing to worry about.	N
135	135	135	00:13:28	00:13:30	I-I'm going with him.	N
136	136	136	00:13:30	00:13:31	No, you're not.	N
137	137	137	00:13:31	00:13:33	This is where he'll be.	N
138	138	138	00:13:33	00:13:36	I'm gonna need a lawyer.	N
139	139	139	00:13:36	00:13:40	Who do I call? I don't know, call Roger-- he'll know what to do.	N
140	140	140	00:13:42	00:13:45	The victim said the car was black.	N
141	141	141	00:13:45	00:13:47	Well, blue looks black at night.	N
142	142	142	00:14:00	00:14:03	Single file, stop at your number on the floor.	N
143	143	143	00:14:03	00:14:06	When I tell you to turn, you're gonna face the mirror.	N
144	144	144	00:14:07	00:14:10	When you hear your number called, step forward.	N
145	145	145	00:14:10	00:14:11	Turn.	N
146	146	146	00:14:11	00:14:14	Number one, step forward.	N
147	147	147	00:14:17	00:14:19	Step back.	N
148	148	148	00:14:19	00:14:22	Number two, step forward.	N
149	149	149	00:14:24	00:14:26	Step back.	N
150	150	150	00:14:26	00:14:30	Number three, step forward.	N
151	151	151	00:14:36	00:14:38	It's number three.	N
152	152	152	00:14:42	00:14:45	That's the guy who raped me.	N
153	153	153	00:14:56	00:14:58	He's been like that since the lineup.	N
154	154	154	00:14:59	00:15:01	You know, the guilty ones always fall asleep.	N
155	155	155	00:15:07	00:15:09	Dr. Coombs, my name's Gil Grissom.	N
156	156	156	00:15:09	00:15:11	I'm with the crime lab.	N
157	157	157	00:15:11	00:15:14	I'm here to collect a DNA sample, so if you'd open your mouth?	N
158	158	158	00:15:14	00:15:17	DNA?	N
159	159	159	00:15:17	00:15:19	I-I think I should talk to my lawyer.	N
160	160	160	00:15:19	00:15:21	Well, we have a warrant, so we can compel a sample.	N
161	161	161	00:15:21	00:15:22	Either way I'm gonna get it.	N
162	162	162	00:15:22	00:15:24	I haven't done anything.	N
163	163	163	00:15:24	00:15:26	if you're innocent, this'll prove it.	N
164	164	164	00:15:33	00:15:35	Thank you.	N
165	165	165	00:17:18	00:17:25	I compared the eight pairs of shoes we collected at Todd Coombs' house to the shoe print at the crime scene.	N
166	166	166	00:17:25	00:17:26	Mm-hmm. No matches.	N
167	167	167	00:17:26	00:17:29	Well, he could've ditched the shoes anywhere.	N
168	168	168	00:17:29	00:17:30	Yeah, true.	N
169	169	169	00:17:30	00:17:33	So, uh, what do you got, Greg?	N
170	170	170	00:17:33	00:17:37	Well, according to the DNA results, Todd Coombs is not your rapist.	N
171	171	171	00:17:37	00:17:42	You're kidding. There's only seven out of 13, which means we're looking for a sibling.	N
172	172	172	00:17:42	00:17:44	I believe the semen would indicate a brother.	N
173	173	173	00:17:44	00:17:48	Could explain why she picked Todd out of a lineup-- strong family resemblance.	N
174	174	174	00:17:49	00:17:51	She was so sure.	N
175	175	175	00:17:54	00:17:56	Dr. Coombs.	N
176	176	176	00:17:56	00:17:57	You're free to go.	N
177	177	177	00:17:57	00:17:58	So that's it?	N
178	178	178	00:17:59	00:18:00	Yeah.	N
179	179	179	00:18:00	00:18:05	You people think you can do whatever you want-- come into our homes, turn our lives upside down.	N
180	180	180	00:18:05	00:18:09	Who's gonna explain this to our neighbors, our friends?	N
181	181	181	00:18:09	00:18:12	Come on, honey, let's get out of here.	N
182	182	182	00:18:15	00:18:16	You're letting him go? Why?	N
183	183	183	00:18:16	00:18:18	He's not the man that assaulted you.	N
184	184	184	00:18:18	00:18:20	Yes, he is. I identified him.	N
185	185	185	00:18:20	00:18:22	DNA ruled him out.	N
186	186	186	00:18:22	00:18:24	Then you made a mistake.	N
187	187	187	00:18:24	00:18:25	That man raped me.	N
188	188	188	00:18:25	00:18:29	We have some additional leads, and we're working on them.	N
189	189	189	00:18:29	00:18:31	I promise to keep you informed.	N
190	190	190	00:18:31	00:18:32	I saw him.	N
191	191	191	00:18:32	00:18:35	He wanted me to see his face.	N
192	192	192	00:18:35	00:18:37	Linley, it was dark.	N
193	193	193	00:18:37	00:18:41	You were under attack.	N
194	194	194	00:18:41	00:18:43	Under those conditions...	N
195	195	195	00:18:43	00:18:47	pupils dilate, it's hard to focus.	N
196	196	196	00:18:47	00:18:49	You can't always trust your eyes.	N
197	197	197	00:18:49	00:18:55	He wanted me to see his face because he was going to kill me, and now you're letting him go?	N
198	198	198	00:18:55	00:18:57	This is my cell phone number.	N
199	199	199	00:18:57	00:18:59	Call me if you need anything.	N
200	200	200	00:18:59	00:19:01	This isn't gonna keep him away from me.	N
201	201	201	00:19:01	00:19:03	What I need is protection.	N
202	202	202	00:19:03	00:19:05	I need a gun.	N
203	203	203	00:19:05	00:19:09	If you don't feel safe in your home, stay with a friend.	N
204	204	204	00:19:16	00:19:20	I hear you're looking for Todd Coombs' brother.	N
205	205	205	00:19:20	00:19:22	Or brothers.	N
206	206	206	00:19:22	00:19:25	I'll work out the family tree.	N
207	207	207	00:20:21	00:20:24	Yeah, I read all about it in the paper.	N
208	208	208	00:20:24	00:20:30	I'm just sorry our parents weren't alive to see it. Hey, your brother's being hauled in on a rape charge.	N
209	209	209	00:20:30	00:20:31	Does that seem funny to you?	N
210	210	210	00:20:31	00:20:32	A little.	N
211	211	211	00:20:32	00:20:34	Todd was due.	N
212	212	212	00:20:34	00:20:35	Due for what? A reality check.	N
213	213	213	00:20:35	00:20:39	Most people go through life, suffer the ups and downs.	N
214	214	214	00:20:39	00:20:41	Todd only got the ups till now.	N
215	215	215	00:20:41	00:20:44	I'm Roger Coombs. What's going on here?	N
216	216	216	00:20:44	00:20:46	They're cops-- they want our DNA.	N
217	217	217	00:20:46	00:20:49	I'm gonna need the May Hustler and a cup.	N
218	218	218	00:20:49	00:20:50	That won't be necessary.	N
219	219	219	00:20:50	00:20:54	We're not giving you anything until our lawyer looks this over.	N
220	220	220	00:20:54	00:20:56	Let me tell you how this works.	N
221	221	221	00:20:56	00:20:57	First things first.	N
222	222	222	00:20:57	00:21:00	We do the test, and then the lawyers come in.	N
223	223	223	00:21:05	00:21:07	So you two are fraternal twins, huh?	N
224	224	224	00:21:08	00:21:10	Accident of birth.	N
225	225	225	00:21:14	00:21:15	You want a sample of my DNA?	N
226	226	226	00:21:15	00:21:18	What for? It's an ongoing investigation, sir-- a rape.	N
227	227	227	00:21:19	00:21:21	Can't discuss it any further than that.	N
228	228	228	00:21:21	00:21:23	Does your route include the southern highlands?	N
229	229	229	00:21:23	00:21:25	No, I work this side of the 15, Seven Hills.	N
230	230	230	00:21:25	00:21:26	Were you working two nights ago?	N
231	231	231	00:21:26	00:21:28	You talked to my supervisor-- you know I was.	N
232	232	232	00:21:28	00:21:33	Look, I heard about what happened to that lady, and I know what you guys put Todd and Crystal through.	N
233	233	233	00:21:34	00:21:35	You got something against my family?	N
234	234	234	00:21:35	00:21:37	You got something against cooperating?	N
235	235	235	00:21:50	00:21:53	Hey, how'd it go with brother number four?	N
236	236	236	00:21:53	00:21:57	Nowhere. No Kevin Coombs at the address you gave me; no forwarding address.	N
237	237	237	00:21:57	00:21:59	PD's following up.	N
238	238	238	00:22:11	00:22:12	Willows.	N
239	239	239	00:22:12	00:22:14	I can't wait 72 hours for a gun.	N
240	240	240	00:22:14	00:22:16	I need it today! I need it now!	N
241	241	241	00:22:16	00:22:17	Linley?	N
242	242	242	00:22:17	00:22:19	Hold on.	N
243	243	243	00:22:21	00:22:23	Linley, I can barely hear you. Where are you?	N
244	244	244	00:22:23	00:22:25	Fremont Street. I-I know you can help me.	N
245	245	245	00:22:25	00:22:28	Just-just give me a name. Tell me where to go.	N
246	246	246	00:22:31	00:22:33	Linley?	N
247	247	247	00:22:33	00:22:34	Linley?!	N
248	248	248	00:22:54	00:22:55	Where is she?	N
249	249	249	00:22:55	00:22:57	We just rolled up.	N
250	250	250	00:23:10	00:23:12	Hey.	N
251	251	251	00:23:13	00:23:16	There's no new damage except for the window.	N
252	252	252	00:23:16	00:23:19	Blood is probably from whoever broke the glass, not the victim.	N
253	253	253	00:23:23	00:23:29	Okay, the pawn shop owner ID'd her, she was looking to buy a gun, and she wasn't in the mood to wait.	N
254	254	254	00:23:29	00:23:31	Anybody see what happened here?	N
255	255	255	00:23:31	00:23:35	Well, the problem is that when the light show starts, everyone's looking up.	N
256	256	256	00:23:36	00:23:40	I mean, what's the chance that this crime is unrelated to the first attack?	N
257	257	257	00:23:40	00:23:40	It's the same guy.	N
258	258	258	00:23:40	00:23:42	He's getting rid of the witness.	N
259	259	259	00:23:42	00:23:43	Who identified the wrong man.	N
260	260	260	00:23:44	00:23:46	Soon as the DNA comes back, we'll know which brother it is.	N
261	261	261	00:23:46	00:23:47	And until then we wait?	N
262	262	262	00:23:47	00:23:50	Well, I got every police officer downtown looking for her.	N
263	263	263	00:23:50	00:23:51	Shoulda had eyes on the brothers.	N
264	264	264	00:23:51	00:23:53	Yeah, in a perfect world, yeah.	N
265	265	265	00:23:53	00:23:57	Didn't you say that you were on the phone with her and you heard the window break?	N
266	266	266	00:23:57	00:23:58	Yes.	N
267	267	267	00:23:58	00:23:59	Did you find her phone?	N
268	268	268	00:23:59	00:24:01	I looked everywhere.	N
269	269	269	00:24:04	00:24:06	So where's her phone?	N
270	270	270	00:24:07	00:24:08	The is Dispatch.	N

273	273	273	00:24:13	00:24:18	Larry Coombs at his place of employment.	N
274	274	274	00:24:18	00:24:23	And Bailey Coombs, on shift, Seven Hills.	N
275	275	275	00:24:23	00:24:24	All right, fine, fine.	N
276	276	276	00:24:24	00:24:26	Search the whole house if you want to.	N
277	277	277	00:24:26	00:24:28	I'm telling you, Todd's not here.	N
278	278	278	00:24:28	00:24:30	His car was in the driveway.	N
279	279	279	00:24:30	00:24:31	That's because he took my car to The House Company.	N
280	280	280	00:24:31	00:24:33	You going to arrest him for that, too?	N
281	281	281	00:24:33	00:24:36	I'm going to need your license number and a full description of your vehicle.	N
282	282	282	00:24:36	00:24:40	How'd you guys know Linley Parker's cell was E-911 capable?	N
283	283	283	00:24:40	00:24:42	We just took a shot.	N
284	284	284	00:24:42	00:24:46	She's got a lot of new gadgets in her car, most new cell phones are imbedded with a GPS chip.	N
285	285	285	00:24:46	00:24:49	Her carrier accepted the Attorney General waiver.	N
286	286	286	00:24:49	00:24:51	I'm accessing her site now.	N
287	287	287	00:24:51	00:24:54	If her phone's on, it should show up.	N
288	288	288	00:24:54	00:24:55	Okay.	N

292	292	292	00:25:08	00:25:10	Hey, Catherine.	N
293	293	293	00:25:10	00:25:12	She's moving.	N

295	295	295	00:25:14	00:25:18	Put out a BOLLO on a beige, 2004 Ford Taurus.	N
296	296	296	00:25:18	00:25:24	Registration, Nevada, 3-9-6-R-G-F.	N
297	297	297	00:25:24	00:25:26	The driver's name is Todd Coombs.	N
298	298	298	00:25:26	00:25:29	He's a white male, 38 years old.	N
299	299	299	00:25:29	00:25:33	I'm on my way to The House Company in Green Valley.	N
300	300	300	00:25:33	00:25:34	Yeah.	N
301	301	301	00:26:02	00:26:04	You make a mess?	N
302	302	302	00:26:04	00:26:06	That's your job.	N
303	303	303	00:26:07	00:26:10	Unless you've got a warrant, you can't even touch this car.	N
304	304	304	00:26:10	00:26:12	I'm just looking.	N
305	305	305	00:26:12	00:26:14	For what?	N
306	306	306	00:26:15	00:26:17	So how was Wal-Mart?	N
307	307	307	00:26:17	00:26:21	I was at The House Company buying some plants for my wife, to cheer her up.	N
308	308	308	00:26:21	00:26:23	Oh, you think that's going to work?	N
309	309	309	00:26:24	00:26:25	A gesture goes a long way.	N
310	310	310	00:26:25	00:26:27	Never worked for me.	N
311	311	311	00:26:27	00:26:28	Hey, do you mind turning that thing off?	N
312	312	312	00:26:28	00:26:30	When the quarters run out.	N
313	313	313	00:26:30	00:26:32	So when were you at the store?	N
314	314	314	00:26:32	00:26:34	Why don't you ask my brothers?	N
315	315	315	00:26:34	00:26:38	I've got a cousin in Phoenix, maybe he knows.	N
316	316	316	00:26:41	00:26:47	Last time I cooperated with you guys, you put me in a lineup and I spent the night in jail.	N
317	317	317	00:26:47	00:26:48	That's right, that's right.	N
318	318	318	00:26:50	00:26:51	Hey, let me tell you something.	N
319	319	319	00:26:51	00:26:56	12 hours after Linley Parker ID'd you as her rapist, she gets dragged out of her car on Fremont Street.	N
320	320	320	00:26:56	00:26:57	Now she's missing.	N
321	321	321	00:26:57	00:27:01	Then why are you wasting time talking to me?	N
322	322	322	00:27:06	00:27:08	Drive safely.	N
323	323	323	00:27:23	00:27:24	Crime lab.	N
324	324	324	00:27:24	00:27:25	Yeah, this is Jim Brass.	N

333	333	333	00:27:48	00:27:50	Fifty.	N
334	334	334	00:27:51	00:27:53	Okay, okay, she stopped.	N
335	335	335	00:27:53	00:27:54	30 feet, she's right here.	N
336	336	336	00:27:54	00:27:56	30 feet.	N

339	339	339	00:29:55	00:29:57	Crime scenes on a 20-acre plot.	N
340	340	340	00:29:57	00:30:00	Guess who owns the property.	N
341	341	341	00:30:00	00:30:01	One of the Coombs brothers.	N

343	343	343	00:30:06	00:30:07	Guy's an artist.	N
344	344	344	00:30:07	00:30:09	You call that art?	N
345	345	345	00:30:12	00:30:14	Black SUV.	N
346	346	346	00:30:15	00:30:17	You're on my property!	N
347	347	347	00:30:18	00:30:19	Put the weapon down.	N
348	348	348	00:30:19	00:30:20	You're on my property!	N
349	349	349	00:30:20	00:30:23	Las Vegas Police, drop it or we shoot.	N
350	350	350	00:30:23	00:30:24	Turn around.	N
351	351	351	00:30:30	00:30:31	Are you Kevin Coombs?	N
352	352	352	00:30:31	00:30:33	I can see the family resemblance.	N
353	353	353	00:30:33	00:30:34	Come on.	N
354	354	354	00:30:38	00:30:42	'Cause of death, asphyxia due to strangulation.	N

356	356	356	00:30:49	00:30:51	Defensive wounds.	N
357	357	357	00:30:51	00:30:52	She was a fighter.	N
358	358	358	00:30:52	00:30:55	There's also fresh contusions of the right labia.	N
359	359	359	00:30:56	00:30:58	She was raped again?	N
360	360	360	00:30:58	00:31:02	I did a wet mount of the vaginal secretion with a Christmas tree stain.	N
361	361	361	00:31:02	00:31:04	Slide's under the scope.	N
362	362	362	00:31:10	00:31:11	Sperm.	N
363	363	363	00:31:11	00:31:15	If he was trying to silence a witness, why not just kill her, why rape her again?	N
364	364	364	00:31:15	00:31:18	Maybe rape was just foreplay for this guy.	N
365	365	365	00:31:18	00:31:21	Maybe what he really gets off on is killing.	N
366	366	366	00:31:30	00:31:32	What do you got?	N
367	367	367	00:31:32	00:31:35	Maybe a missing Pontiac Tempest.	N

375	375	375	00:32:11	00:32:14	They can find you.	N
376	376	376	00:32:14	00:32:16	Whenever they want.	N
377	377	377	00:32:24	00:32:25	Dr. Coombs.	N
378	378	378	00:32:25	00:32:27	Mr. Grissom.	N
379	379	379	00:32:27	00:32:31	I suppose you're compelling a DNA sample from my brother now.	N
380	380	380	00:32:31	00:32:32	We are.	N
381	381	381	00:32:34	00:32:35	Why are you here?	N
382	382	382	00:32:35	00:32:38	Are you an only child?	N
383	383	383	00:32:38	00:32:39	I am. Why?	N
384	384	384	00:32:39	00:32:41	You've got my brother in that room, he's family.	N
385	385	385	00:32:41	00:32:43	I didn't want him to be alone.	N
386	386	386	00:32:43	00:32:46	Well, what about your other brothers?	N
387	387	387	00:32:46	00:32:49	Bailey only looks out for number one.	N
388	388	388	00:32:49	00:32:52	Roger and Larry, they do their best to avoid Kevin.	N
389	389	389	00:32:52	00:32:53	They don't understand him.	N
390	390	390	00:32:53	00:32:54	And you do?	N
391	391	391	00:32:54	00:32:55	He's harmless.	N
392	392	392	00:32:55	00:32:56	He chooses to live alone.	N
393	393	393	00:32:56	00:32:57	He lives off the grid.	N
394	394	394	00:32:57	00:33:00	He spends all his time turning junk into art.	N
395	395	395	00:33:00	00:33:01	Where does he get his junk?	N
396	396	396	00:33:01	00:33:04	Mostly from my brother's garage.	N
397	397	397	00:33:04	00:33:09	Every once in a while, Roger lets Kevin take his pick of the wrecks.	N
398	398	398	00:33:09	00:33:12	Beats inviting him over for Thanksgiving, you know?	N
399	399	399	00:33:12	00:33:18	Dr. Coombs, we found a 1968 Pontiac outside your brother's house.	N
400	400	400	00:33:18	00:33:24	The VIN matched a car belonging to a victim who was raped and murdered by the same person who raped Linley Parker.	N
401	401	401	00:33:24	00:33:29	And we found Linley Parker's dead body on your brother's property.	N
402	402	402	00:33:29	00:33:33	You guys have been wrong before.	N
403	403	403	00:34:19	00:34:20	Whew, man.	N
404	404	404	00:34:21	00:34:23	Guys like Brass have it easy.	N
405	405	405	00:34:23	00:34:26	All they got to do is call it in.	N
406	406	406	00:34:26	00:34:28	Check this out. I just found it in the hose.	N
407	407	407	00:34:28	00:34:31	It's from a potted plant purchased at the House Company.	N
408	408	408	00:34:31	00:34:35	Confirms Todd Coombs' alibi.	N
409	409	409	00:34:35	00:34:38	You saw this?	N
410	410	410	00:34:38	00:34:39	A pin from the Palms.	N
411	411	411	00:34:39	00:34:41	Linley Parker worked at the Palms.	N
412	412	412	00:34:44	00:34:47	A lot of people work at the Palms.	N
413	413	413	00:34:47	00:34:49	And it doesn't nail Todd Coombs.	N
414	414	414	00:34:49	00:34:56	According to the DNA, the blood from Linley Parker's smashed window matches the semen from all the rapes.	N
415	415	415	00:34:56	00:34:59	Which means it doesn't match Todd Coombs.	N
416	416	416	00:34:59	00:35:00	Or Kevin Coombs.	N
417	417	417	00:35:00	00:35:03	Or any of the rest of the Brothers Grimm.	N
418	418	418	00:35:03	00:35:07	Linley was absolutely certain that Todd Coombs raped her.	N
419	419	419	00:35:07	00:35:08	That's not what the evidence says.	N
420	420	420	00:35:09	00:35:10	Well, maybe the evidence is wrong.	N
421	421	421	00:35:10	00:35:14	You can be wrong, I can be wrong, the evidence is just the evidence.	N
422	422	422	00:35:14	00:35:16	Deep down, tell me you don't think this guy is good for this.	N
423	423	423	00:35:18	00:35:22	I got the DNA on the hair you lifted off Linley Parker's body.	N
424	424	424	00:35:22	00:35:24	Get this. It's Todd Coombs.	N
425	425	425	00:35:24	00:35:26	Puts him with the body.	N
426	426	426	00:35:26	00:35:27	It doesn't prove rape.	N
427	427	427	00:35:27	00:35:30	I'll have Brass bring him in.	N
428	428	428	00:35:43	00:35:46	Would you strip down to your shorts, please, Doctor?	N
429	429	429	00:35:46	00:35:47	Why?	N
430	430	430	00:35:47	00:35:55	I'm going to examine your clothing for any trace evidence, and we're going to document your body for any injuries that may have been sustained during a recent struggle.	N
431	431	431	00:35:55	00:35:57	I don't have any injuries.	N
432	432	432	00:35:57	00:36:00	If you'd like, this officer will assist you.	N
433	433	433	00:36:01	00:36:02	I did not rape that women.	N
434	434	434	00:36:02	00:36:03	I did not kill her.	N
435	435	435	00:36:03	00:36:06	You guys proved that and you let me go.	N
436	436	436	00:36:26	00:36:28	Thank you. Turn around, please.	N
437	437	437	00:36:33	00:36:35	That's an old scar.	N
438	438	438	00:36:35	00:36:37	I was a bone marrow donor.	N
439	439	439	00:36:37	00:36:40	My youngest brother Joss had leukemia.	N
440	440	440	00:36:43	00:36:44	Hold still please.	N
441	441	441	00:37:02	00:37:04	Turn off the lights, would you, please, officer?	N
442	442	442	00:37:22	00:37:24	What are you looking at?	N
443	443	443	00:38:37	00:38:37	This is harassment.	N
444	444	444	00:38:38	00:38:40	I've already given you guys a DNA sample.	N
445	445	445	00:38:42	00:38:46	You know that bone marrow donation you gave your brother?	N
446	446	446	00:38:48	00:38:50	I checked your medical records.	N
447	447	447	00:38:50	00:38:54	His body rejected it and he died.	N
448	448	448	00:38:55	00:39:00	My guess is that's when you first found out about your unique condition.	N
449	449	449	00:39:10	00:39:14	The doctors explained it.	N
450	450	450	00:39:14	00:39:17	I'm a creature of myth.	N
451	451	451	00:39:17	00:39:20	A chimera.	N
452	452	452	00:39:20	00:39:24	Head of a lion, body of a goat, tail of a dragon.	N
453	453	453	00:39:30	00:39:31	You're a genetic anomaly.	N
454	454	454	00:39:31	00:39:38	One person, two completely different sets of DNA.	N
455	455	455	00:39:42	00:39:44	State your name for the record.	N
456	456	456	00:39:46	00:39:48	My name is Todd Coombs.	N
457	457	457	00:39:48	00:39:53	I raped and murdered Emma Dobbins and Linley Parker.	N
458	458	458	00:39:53	00:39:56	There are more, but we'll talk about those later.	N
459	459	459	00:39:56	00:39:59	How'd you pick your victims?	N
460	460	460	00:39:59	00:40:01	They picked me.	N
461	461	461	00:40:01	00:40:06	Sometimes fraternal twins, two separately fertilized eggs, develop into only one person.	N
462	462	462	00:40:06	00:40:14	In effect, one twin dies in embryo, but its DNA survives in the other.	N
463	463	463	00:40:14	00:40:20	That's why the DNA from his buccal swab matched his hair but not his semen.	N
464	464	464	00:40:20	00:40:23	So he had two strains of DNA in his body.	N
465	465	465	00:40:23	00:40:27	Yeah, and the DNA in his semen, was evidently from his dead twin brother.	N
466	466	466	00:40:27	00:40:30	You never met Emma Dobbins or Linley Parker.	N
467	467	467	00:40:30	00:40:33	I didn't have to meet 'em.	N
468	468	468	00:40:33	00:40:37	You go to a bar, you see an attractive woman, make your move, she shoots you down.	N
469	469	469	00:40:37	00:40:39	You go home, you masturbate.	N
470	470	470	00:40:39	00:40:40	You get on with it.	N
471	471	471	00:40:43	00:40:46	But when I see a woman who arouses me...	N
472	472	472	00:40:50	00:40:53	the whole world disappears...	N
473	473	473	00:40:53	00:40:56	except for her.	N
474	474	474	00:40:57	00:40:59	She can't say no.	N
475	475	475	00:41:00	00:41:01	What a night.	N
476	476	476	00:41:01	00:41:03	You guys hungry?	N
477	477	477	00:41:03	00:41:04	Want to get something to eat?	N
478	478	478	00:41:04	00:41:06	No, I think I'm going to call it a night.	N
479	479	479	00:41:06	00:41:07	Yeah, me, too.	N
480	480	480	00:41:07	00:41:09	I feel ya. Get some rest.	N
481	481	481	00:41:09	00:41:10	All right, I'll see you.	N
482	482	482	00:41:10	00:41:15	Hey, hey, Nick, congratulations on your almost promotion.	N
483	483	483	00:41:15	00:41:18	Seriously, you deserve it.	N
484	484	484	00:41:18	00:41:23	Wow. That's really hard for you, isn't it?	N
485	485	485	00:41:23	00:41:24	Yeah, it is.	N
486	486	486	00:41:34	00:41:36	Grissom.	N
487	487	487	00:41:37	00:41:40	Yes.	N
488	488	488	00:41:44	00:41:45	Is she all right?	N
489	489	489	00:41:48	00:41:51	She was lucky she wasn't on the strip.	N
490	490	490	00:41:51	00:41:53	That's Highway Patrol's jurisdiction.	N
491	491	491	00:41:53	00:41:59	She blew .09.	N
492	492	492	00:41:59	00:42:06	Technically, she's over, but they just lowered the limit, so we cut her a break and didn't book her.	N
493	493	493	00:42:06	00:42:09	But we did have to call the supervisor.	N
494	494	494	00:42:09	00:42:10	Well, thank you.	N
495	495	495	00:42:10	00:42:12	I appreciate the courtesy.	N
496	496	496	00:42:12	00:42:14	No problem.	N
497	497	497	00:42:33	00:42:35	Come on. I'll take you home.	N
