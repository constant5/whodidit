12	12	12	00:01:06	00:01:08	A common raven?	N
13	13	13	00:01:08	00:01:09	So what?	N
14	14	14	00:01:26	00:01:28	Well, someone's missing a contact lens.	N
15	15	15	00:01:28	00:01:31	That's not all they're missing.	N
16	16	16	00:01:31	00:01:36	You know, ravens, like eagles, have been known to travel 30 miles from roost to feeding ground.	N
17	17	17	00:01:37	00:01:40	30 miles in every direction.	N
18	18	18	00:01:40	00:01:42	pi-r-squared.	N

25	25	25	00:02:05	00:02:07	and nothing more.	N
26	26	26	00:03:52	00:03:56	You'll be pleased to know the eyeball was only slightly desiccated.	N
27	27	27	00:03:56	00:03:58	And what about the iris?	N
28	28	28	00:03:58	00:03:59	Still blue.	N
29	29	29	00:03:59	00:04:03	Color distinction means the body's been dead less than 48 hours.	N
30	30	30	00:04:03	00:04:06	Yeah, I sent some vitreous fluid to tox.	N
31	31	31	00:04:06	00:04:07	The rest to DNA.	N
32	32	32	00:04:07	00:04:11	Can you get me an eye for an eye?	N

37	37	37	00:04:27	00:04:31	Well, the only place we'd have seagulls around here would be Lake Mead.	N
38	38	38	00:04:31	00:04:33	But only when the fishing's good.	N
39	39	39	00:04:33	00:04:36	And we got some ground limestone.	N
40	40	40	00:04:37	00:04:39	Not found at Lake Mead.	N

51	51	51	00:05:25	00:05:28	Spotter says cell lift moves forward 20 feet a day.	N
52	52	52	00:05:28	00:05:30	That puts the active cell right...	N
53	53	53	00:05:30	00:05:32	pretty much in front of us.	N
54	54	54	00:05:32	00:05:36	Man! You find the best evidence in the nastiest places.	N
55	55	55	00:05:36	00:05:38	You are what you throw away.	N
56	56	56	00:05:38	00:05:43	It's like peeling an onion into peoples' lives.	N
57	57	57	00:05:43	00:05:47	Well, this onion is our time line so peel back accordingly.	N
58	58	58	00:05:53	00:05:57	The electrolyte and glucose levels in the eye were normal.	N
59	59	59	00:05:58	00:06:01	Means your victim wasn't dehydrated or diabetic.	N
60	60	60	00:06:01	00:06:02	Other than that...	N
61	61	61	00:06:02	00:06:04	We're flying blind.	N

70	70	70	00:06:22	00:06:25	Just routine autopsy.	N
71	71	71	00:06:27	00:06:29	Go for it.	N
72	72	72	00:06:30	00:06:31	Yeah, we're all set, Dr. Robbins.	N
73	73	73	00:06:32	00:06:34	Okay, David.	N

78	78	78	00:06:44	00:06:46	Body received warm to the touch.	N

85	85	85	00:07:07	00:07:11	Okay. David, open him up.	N
86	86	86	00:07:26	00:07:28	Uh... D-Dr. Robbins?	N
87	87	87	00:07:28	00:07:30	Sir, I-I have blood.	N
88	88	88	00:07:31	00:07:32	I have bleeding.	N
89	89	89	00:07:34	00:07:37	Get me my kit.	N
90	90	90	00:07:37	00:07:38	Come on.	N
91	91	91	00:07:40	00:07:40	Hold this.	N
92	92	92	00:08:01	00:08:02	Pulse is rising.	N
93	93	93	00:08:02	00:08:03	David, string me a suture needle.	N
94	94	94	00:08:03	00:08:04	Go! Go!	N

98	98	98	00:09:02	00:09:03	Whoa!	N
99	99	99	00:09:05	00:09:08	Got a leg.	N
100	100	100	00:09:08	00:09:09	Obviously female.	N
101	101	101	00:09:09	00:09:12	Obviously.	N
102	102	102	00:09:12	00:09:14	Whew.	N
103	103	103	00:09:14	00:09:15	Whoo!	N
104	104	104	00:09:15	00:09:16	I'll bag it.	N
105	105	105	00:09:18	00:09:19	Oh, yeah.	N
106	106	106	00:09:19	00:09:21	I got a torso and head.	N
107	107	107	00:09:21	00:09:22	Missing an eye.	N
108	108	108	00:09:24	00:09:28	Okay, so, uh how hot do you think it is, underneath all this trash?	N
109	109	109	00:09:28	00:09:32	I don't know, what do you think-- ballpark at 120 degrees?	N
110	110	110	00:09:32	00:09:34	So this is yesterday's trash.	N
111	111	111	00:09:34	00:09:35	Dead body.	N
112	112	112	00:09:35	00:09:36	Minimum 18 hours in this heat.	N
113	113	113	00:09:36	00:09:38	She should be totally bloated.	N
114	114	114	00:09:38	00:09:39	Yeah, she's not.	N
115	115	115	00:09:39	00:09:41	Yeah, she's really torn up.	N
116	116	116	00:09:44	00:09:46	Bulldozers are vicious.	N
117	117	117	00:09:48	00:09:51	Yeah, I think they only finished the job.	N
118	118	118	00:09:51	00:09:52	How did she get here?	N
119	119	119	00:09:57	00:09:59	Heard you got to be superhero today.	N
120	120	120	00:09:59	00:10:03	I consider myself a superhero every day.	N
121	121	121	00:10:03	00:10:05	Got anything on Our Lady of the Dump?	N
122	122	122	00:10:05	00:10:07	COD is still indeterminate.	N
123	123	123	00:10:07	00:10:10	Blunt force trauma is a possibility.	N
124	124	124	00:10:10	00:10:13	She has some perimortem bruising around the left eye.	N
125	125	125	00:10:13	00:10:16	But limb removal is relatively clean.	N
126	126	126	00:10:16	00:10:17	Definitely postmortem.	N
127	127	127	00:10:17	00:10:20	So we've got no arms, no prints.	N
128	128	128	00:10:20	00:10:23	What kind of identifying characteristics do we have?	N
129	129	129	00:10:23	00:10:24	Second degree midline episiotomy scar.	N
130	130	130	00:10:24	00:10:28	Well, that narrows it down to more than half the women in this country who gave birth.	N
131	131	131	00:10:28	00:10:30	But there might be one other thing.	N
132	132	132	00:10:30	00:10:34	At first I thought appendectomy, but check out her X ray.	N
133	133	133	00:10:34	00:10:35	She's had surgery.	N
134	134	134	00:10:36	00:10:39	Some kind of implant at the L4-L5 interspace.	N
135	135	135	00:10:39	00:10:41	I'll know more when I open her up.	N
136	136	136	00:10:42	00:10:44	You're my hero, Al.	N
137	137	137	00:10:45	00:10:47	All right, what do we know?	N
138	138	138	00:10:47	00:10:50	That all of this trash was found around the victim.	N
139	139	139	00:10:50	00:10:54	And she was buried with some very expensive trash.	N
140	140	140	00:10:54	00:10:57	Yeah, there's nothing wrong with this frying pan.	N
141	141	141	00:10:57	00:10:59	Could've gone to Goodwill or someplace.	N
142	142	142	00:10:59	00:11:01	Home pregnancy test.	N
143	143	143	00:11:01	00:11:03	Negative. Better luck next time.	N
144	144	144	00:11:03	00:11:07	Someone... does not like frozen peas.	N
145	145	145	00:11:07	00:11:09	They weren't shopping at Costco.	N
146	146	146	00:11:09	00:11:11	They paid way too much for ice cream.	N
147	147	147	00:11:11	00:11:15	There's a good chance our vic was wearing this shirt.	N
148	148	148	00:11:15	00:11:18	Let's start trying to narrow this down to a neighborhood, huh?	N
149	149	149	00:11:18	00:11:19	Excellent idea.	N
150	150	150	00:11:20	00:11:21	Uh, marker or sort?	N
151	151	151	00:11:22	00:11:22	Sort.	N
152	152	152	00:11:22	00:11:24	Please.	N
153	153	153	00:11:24	00:11:28	178 Spaulding Meadows.	N
154	154	154	00:11:28	00:11:32	Uh, 174 Storm Cloud Lane.	N
155	155	155	00:11:34	00:11:39	A second 174 Storm Cloud Lane.	N
156	156	156	00:11:39	00:11:41	Pulled it from the L4-L5 interspace.	N
157	157	157	00:11:41	00:11:48	Cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy with a titanium coating and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene component.	N
158	158	158	00:11:48	00:11:50	An artificial spinal disc.	N
159	159	159	00:11:50	00:11:54	If you can recreate a spine the possibilities are endless.	N
160	160	160	00:11:54	00:11:59	I thought, uh, disc replacement surgery involved fusing bone to bone.	N
161	161	161	00:11:59	00:12:02	Eh, typically, but it can limit mobility.	N
162	162	162	00:12:02	00:12:04	With that little disc, your body doesn't know the difference.	N
163	163	163	00:12:05	00:12:10	Matches range of motion, flexibility and an axial rotation of a normal spine.	N
164	164	164	00:12:10	00:12:12	Still in clinical trials.	N
165	165	165	00:12:12	00:12:16	Less than a thousand surgeries have been performed in this country.	N
166	166	166	00:12:16	00:12:18	Oh, well, I like those odds.	N
167	167	167	00:12:18	00:12:20	You'll like this even better.	N
168	168	168	00:12:20	00:12:25	Medium endplate, size 12, polyethylene component and a six-degree lordosis angle.	N
169	169	169	00:12:25	00:12:27	Narrowed it down to one.	N
170	170	170	00:12:27	00:12:28	Amy Ennis.	N
171	171	171	00:12:28	00:12:30	Austin, Texas.	N
172	172	172	00:12:30	00:12:32	Tourist?	N
173	173	173	00:12:33	00:12:36	That's for you to find out.	N
174	174	174	00:12:45	00:12:47	Hey, is this all of them?	N
175	175	175	00:12:47	00:12:50	Yeah, every last one on Storm Cloud Lane.	N
176	176	176	00:12:50	00:12:55	Cans are on private property, it's not trash day, how did you get consent?	N
177	177	177	00:12:55	00:12:57	I talked to the president of the owner's association.	N
178	178	178	00:12:57	00:12:58	What'd you threaten her with?	N
179	179	179	00:12:58	00:13:00	A return visit.	N
180	180	180	00:13:03	00:13:04	Hey, guys?	N
181	181	181	00:13:04	00:13:05	I got blood.	N
182	182	182	00:13:05	00:13:07	Yeah.	N
183	183	183	00:13:07	00:13:08	Yeah me, too.	N
184	184	184	00:13:08	00:13:11	Well, that makes five.	N
185	185	185	00:13:11	00:13:13	Let's see if any of it's human.	N
186	186	186	00:13:34	00:13:36	These two are human.	N
187	187	187	00:13:43	00:13:48	If the vic was in here blood would have pooled to the bottom.	N
188	188	188	00:13:51	00:13:56	Yeah, and blood dripped down the side of this one as the hydraulic arm dumped it.	N
189	189	189	00:14:00	00:14:01	This is our can.	N
190	190	190	00:14:03	00:14:05	And that's our house.	N
191	191	191	00:14:05	00:14:08	You found blood... in my trash can?	N
192	192	192	00:14:08	00:14:10	Any idea how it got there?	N
193	193	193	00:14:10	00:14:13	No.	N
194	194	194	00:14:13	00:14:15	Do you know an Amy Ennis from Austin, Texas?	N
195	195	195	00:14:15	00:14:17	No.	N
196	196	196	00:14:17	00:14:20	So, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about?	N
197	197	197	00:14:22	00:14:25	Dad... you all right?	N
198	198	198	00:14:25	00:14:27	I'm fine.	N
199	199	199	00:14:27	00:14:28	What's going on?	N
200	200	200	00:14:28	00:14:30	I'm just asking your father a few questions.	N
201	201	201	00:14:30	00:14:31	Why don't you go inside and make some dinner?	N
202	202	202	00:14:32	00:14:33	What are you in the mood for?	N
203	203	203	00:14:33	00:14:35	Whatever you want.	N
204	204	204	00:14:38	00:14:39	Charlie, homework.	N
205	205	205	00:14:39	00:14:41	Hey. Get the job?	N
206	206	206	00:14:41	00:14:43	Later.	N
207	207	207	00:14:43	00:14:44	Divorced?	N
208	208	208	00:14:44	00:14:45	Yeah.	N
209	209	209	00:14:46	00:14:47	Five years.	N
210	210	210	00:14:47	00:14:50	I hear David's resurrecting the dead now.	N
211	211	211	00:14:50	00:14:52	Yeah, our little miracle worker.	N
212	212	212	00:14:52	00:14:54	I just came from the hospital.	N
213	213	213	00:14:54	00:14:56	That guy's in ICU with respiratory paralysis.	N
214	214	214	00:14:56	00:15:01	I did get a prelim on his blood work-- looks like some sort of an organic poison.	N
215	215	215	00:15:01	00:15:04	Well, that would explain the discoloration Robbins found around his mouth.	N
216	216	216	00:15:04	00:15:06	I'm telling you, this is great.	N
217	217	217	00:15:06	00:15:07	You're going to love this.	N
218	218	218	00:15:07	00:15:09	30 miles to the gallon, very low maintenance.	N
219	219	219	00:15:09	00:15:11	Your people are going to love it.	N
220	220	220	00:15:11	00:15:14	You know what? I want you to tell them to throw away the manuals.	N
221	221	221	00:15:14	00:15:15	Call me for anything.	N
222	222	222	00:15:15	00:15:19	Marty Gibson doesn't close a sale, he opens a relationship.	N
223	223	223	00:15:19	00:15:20	That guy's a charmer.	N
224	224	224	00:15:20	00:15:22	Yeah, real Ricky Roma.	N
225	225	225	00:15:29	00:15:30	May I help you, gentlemen?	N
226	226	226	00:15:30	00:15:31	I'm Warrick Brown, this is Gil Grissom.	N
227	227	227	00:15:31	00:15:33	We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
228	228	228	00:15:33	00:15:34	Oh. Nanci Linden.	N
229	229	229	00:15:34	00:15:35	It's a pleasure to meet you.	N
230	230	230	00:15:35	00:15:38	We have a warrant to search your premises.	N
231	231	231	00:15:38	00:15:42	What for? For evidence concerning the attempted murder of Fred Stearns.	N
232	232	232	00:15:42	00:15:45	Oh, he had a heart attack.	N
233	233	233	00:15:45	00:15:47	He's dead.	N
234	234	234	00:15:47	00:15:49	No, he didn't...	N
235	235	235	00:15:49	00:15:51	and he's not.	N
236	236	236	00:15:53	00:15:54	Gigi, shush.	N
237	237	237	00:15:54	00:15:55	Shh! ( whimpers )	N
238	238	238	00:15:55	00:15:56	I'm sorry.	N
239	239	239	00:15:56	00:16:00	I'm not supposed to bring her in here.	N
240	240	240	00:16:06	00:16:08	So, this was...	N
241	241	241	00:16:08	00:16:09	is Fred's desk.	N
242	242	242	00:16:09	00:16:12	Nobody's touched it since they took him away.	N
243	243	243	00:16:12	00:16:13	It's bad luck.	N
244	244	244	00:16:13	00:16:15	Middle desk is Marty Gibson.	N
245	245	245	00:16:15	00:16:17	The one on the end is Clyde Hinton.	N
246	246	246	00:16:17	00:16:19	Thank you.	N
247	247	247	00:16:23	00:16:27	Poison could've come from any of these sources here.	N
248	248	248	00:16:27	00:16:29	Oral fixation you think?	N
249	249	249	00:16:29	00:16:32	Constant need for gratification?	N
250	250	250	00:16:32	00:16:33	In every way.	N
251	251	251	00:16:33	00:16:35	This guy was like the monster closer.	N
252	252	252	00:16:37	00:16:39	You ever buy a brand-new car, Griss?	N
253	253	253	00:16:39	00:16:42	Depreciation doesn't make it a logical investment.	N
254	254	254	00:16:42	00:16:44	It's not about logic.	N
255	255	255	00:16:44	00:16:45	It's about that smell.	N
256	256	256	00:16:45	00:16:47	There's nothing like the smell of a brand-new car.	N
257	257	257	00:16:47	00:16:49	How right you are.	N
258	258	258	00:16:50	00:16:50	Marty Gibson.	N
259	259	259	00:16:52	00:16:54	We're not buying, we're looking.	N
260	260	260	00:16:54	00:16:57	If we need any help we'll let you know.	N
261	261	261	00:16:57	00:17:01	Sometimes it's not about what you need, sometimes it's about what you want.	N
262	262	262	00:17:45	00:17:49	You always, uh, lock your drawers?	N
263	263	263	00:17:51	00:17:52	Huh.	N
264	264	264	00:17:54	00:17:56	You're the one who super-glued Fred's phone.	N
265	265	265	00:17:57	00:18:00	will turn any mouth black for days.	N
266	266	266	00:18:03	00:18:04	Warrick Brown.	N
267	267	267	00:18:04	00:18:07	I get it. You're the funny guy.	N
268	268	268	00:18:07	00:18:09	You know the definition of kismet, Mr. Grissom?	N
269	269	269	00:18:09	00:18:13	Do you know the definition of attempted murder, Mr. Hinton?	N
270	270	270	00:18:13	00:18:14	Just go with me for a second.	N
271	271	271	00:18:14	00:18:16	Go with you where?	N
272	272	272	00:18:16	00:18:18	Come on... kismet.	N
273	273	273	00:18:18	00:18:24	Fate, or destiny from the Arabic word meaning to distribute, or divide up.	N
274	274	274	00:18:24	00:18:26	Smart guy.	N
275	275	275	00:18:26	00:18:28	Destiny is what you make of it.	N
276	276	276	00:18:28	00:18:33	It's what gets distributed to me while the other guy's washing the stain off his lips.	N
277	277	277	00:18:33	00:18:35	Well, boys, just closed another fatty.	N
278	278	278	00:18:35	00:18:38	Two hours of schmooze-- I can't lose.	N
279	279	279	00:18:38	00:18:39	Your lips.	N
280	280	280	00:18:40	00:18:41	Clyde!	N
281	281	281	00:18:41	00:18:42	Don't worry, Freddy.	N
282	282	282	00:18:42	00:18:44	I'll handle the client.	N
283	283	283	00:18:45	00:18:49	Look, everyone tries to get an edge in this business.	N
284	284	284	00:18:49	00:18:51	I use jokes.	N
285	285	285	00:18:51	00:18:53	Fred Stearns just passed away.	N
286	286	286	00:18:53	00:18:55	Again.	N
287	287	287	00:18:59	00:19:02	Dead guy. Not funny.	N
288	288	288	00:19:06	00:19:08	Okay, David, take two.	N
289	289	289	00:19:13	00:19:15	No luck on Amy Ennis's next of kin.	N
290	290	290	00:19:15	00:19:17	The Austin PD is still working on it.	N
291	291	291	00:19:17	00:19:18	Well, we know that she had a kid.	N
292	292	292	00:19:18	00:19:19	Well, she gave birth.	N
293	293	293	00:19:19	00:19:21	That doesn't mean that she had a kid.	N
294	294	294	00:19:21	00:19:23	So, what, we've got nothing?	N
295	295	295	00:19:23	00:19:28	We have a Mercury Sable, uh, Texas plates, found in the lot of the Tangiers hotel.	N
296	296	296	00:19:28	00:19:29	She's the registered owner.	N
297	297	297	00:19:29	00:19:30	They're bringing it in now.	N
298	298	298	00:19:45	00:19:50	If the poison was administered orally I may know how it got into the bloodstream.	N
299	299	299	00:19:51	00:19:54	Gastric ulcer.	N
300	300	300	00:19:54	00:20:02	In a healthy, functioning stomach mucosa lines the walls and prevents the hydrochloric acid from burning the organ itself.	N
301	301	301	00:20:02	00:20:08	But if h. pylori gets in there, sends the whole system off-balance, stops the mucosa, and causes an ulcer.	N
302	302	302	00:20:08	00:20:13	Opens a direct channel from your digestive tract straight into your bloodstream.	N
303	303	303	00:20:14	00:20:16	I know a lot about stress-related ailments.	N
304	304	304	00:20:16	00:20:19	Any word yet on a poison?	N
305	305	305	00:20:19	00:20:22	Tox screen ruled out the ink gum.	N
306	306	306	00:20:22	00:20:24	It could've been a factor, though.	N
307	307	307	00:20:24	00:20:27	Uh, gum churns up stomach acid-- instant inflammation.	N
308	308	308	00:20:27	00:20:29	I don't care about his indigestion, Doc.	N
309	309	309	00:20:29	00:20:30	We need to know what killed him.	N
310	310	310	00:20:30	00:20:33	Well, she wasn't in town on business.	N
311	311	311	00:20:33	00:20:34	What's that?	N
312	312	312	00:20:36	00:20:37	Oh!	N
313	313	313	00:20:37	00:20:39	Depends on what her business was, I guess.	N
314	314	314	00:20:43	00:20:47	Nothing risquÃ© about the rest of her wardrobe.	N
315	315	315	00:20:47	00:20:49	Maybe she got it here. She could've met somebody, you know.	N
316	316	316	00:20:52	00:20:54	Okay, I'm going to fume.	N
317	317	317	00:21:21	00:21:25	According to Greg, the hairs and the DNA from the toothbrush are a match to the vic.	N
318	318	318	00:21:25	00:21:27	What about the prints from her car?	N
319	319	319	00:21:27	00:21:28	I thought I messed it up, so I ran it twice.	N
320	320	320	00:21:28	00:21:32	No errant prints, all a match to the same woman.	N
321	321	321	00:21:32	00:21:33	Amy Ennis.	N
322	322	322	00:21:33	00:21:35	No Amy Ennis in the database.	N
323	323	323	00:21:35	00:21:37	Well, Amy Ennis is our vic. It's her car.	N
324	324	324	00:21:37	00:21:39	Prints came back to somebody named Kelly Easton.	N
325	325	325	00:21:39	00:21:41	Kelly Easton...	N
326	326	326	00:21:41	00:21:43	Easton...	N
327	327	327	00:21:43	00:21:44	174 Storm Cloud Lane?	N
328	328	328	00:21:44	00:21:47	What's the first thing you do when you don't want to be found?	N
329	329	329	00:21:47	00:21:49	Leave town. Yeah...	N
330	330	330	00:21:49	00:21:51	and change your name.	N
331	331	331	00:21:52	00:21:54	...want to Mulligan on your first story?	N
332	332	332	00:21:55	00:21:56	Divorced?	N
333	333	333	00:21:56	00:21:58	What the hell was I supposed to say?	N
334	334	334	00:21:58	00:22:02	My wife went out to get her hair done and never came home.	N
335	335	335	00:22:02	00:22:06	Well, maybe you gave her a reason to leave.	N
336	336	336	00:22:06	00:22:07	Spousal abuse, cheating...	N
337	337	337	00:22:08	00:22:09	Aw, you people.	N
338	338	338	00:22:09	00:22:17	You know, you were here five years ago with your grid searches, your dogs, your cadets-- you came up empty.	N
339	339	339	00:22:17	00:22:24	You give me a good reason why my wife left me, I'd love to hear it, because I tried the truth.	N
340	340	340	00:22:24	00:22:25	I didn't know what happened.	N
341	341	341	00:22:25	00:22:28	You know what I got for it?	N
342	342	342	00:22:28	00:22:31	They all think I killed my wife.	N
343	343	343	00:22:31	00:22:34	Her parents sued me for custody.	N
344	344	344	00:22:34	00:22:36	I lost my job, my friends.	N
345	345	345	00:22:36	00:22:40	Only thing I got left are those kids and this house.	N
346	346	346	00:22:40	00:22:42	Okay, you didn't kill her.	N
347	347	347	00:22:42	00:22:44	At least back then.	N
348	348	348	00:23:28	00:23:31	I don't think these belong to Dad.	N
349	349	349	00:23:33	00:23:35	Could place Mrs. Easton at the house.	N
350	350	350	00:23:35	00:23:37	She came back about a month ago.	N
351	351	351	00:23:37	00:23:39	Doorbell rings...	N
352	352	352	00:23:42	00:23:43	Huh, what do you say?	N
353	353	353	00:23:44	00:23:45	Hi.	N
354	354	354	00:23:47	00:23:49	You tell me.	N
355	355	355	00:23:49	00:23:51	Whatever it is, it must've worked.	N
356	356	356	00:23:51	00:23:53	She was back in your bedroom.	N
357	357	357	00:23:53	00:23:56	Well, they say time heals all wounds.	N
358	358	358	00:23:56	00:23:58	It's crap.	N
359	359	359	00:23:58	00:24:04	I hate her for what she did to us, but I swear, it was the first time I felt anything in five years.	N
360	360	360	00:25:09	00:25:11	So, she's really dead?	N
361	361	361	00:25:12	00:25:13	Yeah.	N
362	362	362	00:25:14	00:25:15	Yeah, I'm sorry.	N
363	363	363	00:25:15	00:25:17	Figures.	N
364	364	364	00:25:17	00:25:17	How's that?	N
365	365	365	00:25:17	00:25:19	She left without telling us.	N
366	366	366	00:25:20	00:25:21	Figures she'd die the same way.	N
367	367	367	00:25:22	00:25:25	I don't think your mom knew she was going to die, bud.	N
368	368	368	00:25:25	00:25:27	Whatever.	N
369	369	369	00:25:30	00:25:34	Last time I saw my mother, I was... in seventh grade.	N
370	370	370	00:25:34	00:25:38	She handed me my lunch and said, See you after school.	N
371	371	371	00:25:38	00:25:39	Did you know that she was back?	N
372	372	372	00:25:39	00:25:42	I thought that she was dead.	N
373	373	373	00:25:44	00:25:46	Can I sit down?	N
374	374	374	00:25:46	00:25:48	Yeah, sure.	N
375	375	375	00:25:48	00:25:50	Nora, I'm sorry.	N
376	376	376	00:25:50	00:25:55	I know this has got to be very hard on you and your brother.	N
377	377	377	00:25:56	00:25:58	And my dad.	N
378	378	378	00:26:04	00:26:06	Is your dad seeing anybody?	N
379	379	379	00:26:06	00:26:09	Does he have a girlfriend?	N
380	380	380	00:26:09	00:26:11	How could he?	N
381	381	381	00:27:45	00:27:50	This is where I found the hairs, in between the packages of frozen peas.	N
382	382	382	00:27:52	00:27:54	Mrs. Easton was a brunette.	N
383	383	383	00:27:54	00:27:58	And we found a warehouse worth of frozen peas at the landfill.	N
384	384	384	00:28:00	00:28:02	Lack of swelling, clean fractures...	N
385	385	385	00:28:06	00:28:07	She was frozen.	N
386	386	386	00:28:12	00:28:14	Skin and muscle would've lost elasticity.	N
387	387	387	00:28:14	00:28:17	Fracture planes would've passed through in a straight line.	N
388	388	388	00:28:17	00:28:21	I'm thinking somebody in this family stuck her in here, waited 'til trash day.	N
389	389	389	00:28:26	00:28:29	Well, the garbage tells us how she was killed.	N
390	390	390	00:28:29	00:28:31	Now I want to know who.	N
391	391	391	00:28:37	00:28:41	That unknown substance I collected from Marty Gibson's coat...	N
392	392	392	00:28:41	00:28:43	Possibly reptilian skin?	N
393	393	393	00:28:43	00:28:44	How'd you know?	N
394	394	394	00:28:44	00:28:45	Tox report.	N
395	395	395	00:28:46	00:28:49	The organic poison came back snake venom.	N
396	396	396	00:28:49	00:28:55	I think maybe it's time to open a relationship with Marty Gibson.	N
397	397	397	00:28:55	00:28:58	We found reptile skin on your jacket sleeve.	N
398	398	398	00:28:58	00:29:02	So, unless you're shedding, we want to know how it got there.	N
399	399	399	00:29:02	00:29:03	Whoa, gentlemen, slow down.	N
400	400	400	00:29:03	00:29:05	Can I get you a cup of coffee?	N
401	401	401	00:29:05	00:29:06	Nanci...? No, thank you.	N
402	402	402	00:29:06	00:29:08	Doughnut? Everybody loves doughnuts. Nanci.	N
403	403	403	00:29:08	00:29:10	No doughnuts.	N
404	404	404	00:29:10	00:29:13	Fred Stearns dropped a dime at Girls, Girls, Girls and wrote it off.	N
405	405	405	00:29:13	00:29:14	Kaido Computers.	N
406	406	406	00:29:14	00:29:16	Software guys are nuts, into the kinky stuff.	N
407	407	407	00:29:16	00:29:19	End of the day, they're driving Fred's cars.	N
408	408	408	00:29:19	00:29:21	Neiman Marcus, jewelry department?	N
409	409	409	00:29:21	00:29:23	Fred knew you got to spend money to make money.	N
410	410	410	00:29:24	00:29:25	Well, here's a freaky one.	N
411	411	411	00:29:25	00:29:27	Since when are two dozen mice a business expense?	N
412	412	412	00:29:27	00:29:30	Since I got The Pet Place to buy a mini-van from me.	N
413	413	413	00:29:30	00:29:31	My cousin works there.	N
414	414	414	00:29:31	00:29:32	You got kids?	N
415	415	415	00:29:32	00:29:35	I could put you in a wagon way below sticker.	N
416	416	416	00:29:35	00:29:39	Marty, what'd you do with the mice?	N
417	417	417	00:29:39	00:29:41	What do you care?	N
418	418	418	00:29:41	00:29:44	You going to arrest me for blurring the lines?	N
419	419	419	00:29:44	00:29:45	No.	N
420	420	420	00:29:45	00:29:47	We were leaning towards murder.	N
421	421	421	00:29:52	00:29:55	You guys are completely overreacting.	N
422	422	422	00:29:55	00:29:57	It's just a hobby.	N
423	423	423	00:29:57	00:29:59	See?	N
424	424	424	00:29:59	00:30:01	Fuzzies. They're food.	N
425	425	425	00:30:01	00:30:04	You know it's illegal in the State of Nevada to have venomous snakes?	N
426	426	426	00:30:05	00:30:07	If you handle them correctly, snakes are harmless.	N
427	427	427	00:30:07	00:30:08	I know what I'm doing.	N
428	428	428	00:30:08	00:30:10	Yeah, that's what we're afraid of.	N
429	429	429	00:30:10	00:30:13	I didn't even know she was dead.	N
430	430	430	00:30:13	00:30:15	Thought she'd just left me again.	N
431	431	431	00:30:15	00:30:18	Well, it's a good thing you didn't tell the kids mom was back.	N
432	432	432	00:30:18	00:30:21	My client agreed to talk to you, not be harassed by you.	N
433	433	433	00:30:21	00:30:22	You're right.	N
434	434	434	00:30:22	00:30:24	Well, you were excited to see her.	N
435	435	435	00:30:24	00:30:25	Why wouldn't the kids be?	N
436	436	436	00:30:25	00:30:26	I'm an adult.	N
437	437	437	00:30:26	00:30:30	That's right, you're an adult-- knowledgeable, experienced...	N
438	438	438	00:30:33	00:30:36	Administration of Estates of Missing Persons.	N
439	439	439	00:30:36	00:30:37	It's a matter of public record.	N
440	440	440	00:30:38	00:30:40	We've been filling out those forms for five years.	N
441	441	441	00:30:40	00:30:41	You're jumping the gun.	N
442	442	442	00:30:41	00:30:43	It's four years, 11 months, one week.	N
443	443	443	00:30:43	00:30:45	So what?	N
444	444	444	00:30:45	00:30:48	Well, in three weeks, Mrs. Easton's estate can be distributed to her husband.	N
445	445	445	00:30:48	00:30:51	You had a half a million dollar life insurance policy on your wife.	N
446	446	446	00:30:51	00:30:52	And she had one on me.	N
447	447	447	00:30:52	00:30:53	We did that for the kids.	N
448	448	448	00:30:54	00:30:57	But you're not dead, and she wasn't either, two days ago.	N
449	449	449	00:30:57	00:31:01	You know, for an unemployed guy you're doing a lot of spending.	N
450	450	450	00:31:01	00:31:05	I mean, Tiffany's, La Perla International Watch Company...	N
451	451	451	00:31:05	00:31:07	Expecting a windfall?	N
452	452	452	00:31:07	00:31:08	Don't answer that.	N
453	453	453	00:31:09	00:31:11	You're fishing.	N
454	454	454	00:31:11	00:31:12	No, I do that with a pole.	N
455	455	455	00:31:12	00:31:14	No, I'm just thinking out loud.	N
456	456	456	00:31:14	00:31:15	Your wife disappears.	N
457	457	457	00:31:15	00:31:19	Five years after the fact, you get the money.	N
458	458	458	00:31:19	00:31:21	You've earned it, it's yours, but she screwed you up.	N
459	459	459	00:31:21	00:31:23	She showed up.	N
460	460	460	00:31:25	00:31:28	I did not kill my wife.	N
461	461	461	00:31:28	00:31:29	What happened, Daniel?	N
462	462	462	00:31:30	00:31:33	The sex wasn't as good as you remembered it, or the money was better?	N
463	463	463	00:31:34	00:31:35	What happened?	N
464	464	464	00:31:39	00:31:43	Scales found on your suspect's jacket are keeled.	N
465	465	465	00:31:43	00:31:46	Diamondback Rattlesnake.	N
466	466	466	00:31:46	00:31:49	His others, smooth scales.	N
467	467	467	00:31:49	00:31:54	A snake fang is basically a hypodermic needle.	N
468	468	468	00:31:54	00:31:56	Oral glands hold in the venom...	N
469	469	469	00:31:57	00:31:58	like the barrel.	N
470	470	470	00:31:58	00:32:05	When aggravated, the jaw muscles push on the toxin, like a plunger.	N
471	471	471	00:32:05	00:32:08	Only, our victim didn't have any puncture wounds.	N
472	472	472	00:32:11	00:32:20	Well, your guy's probably pretty comfortable with his collection-- otherwise, he'd be dead-- which means, he could've milked this one.	N
473	473	473	00:32:20	00:32:22	And brought the venom with him to the dealership.	N
474	474	474	00:32:23	00:32:26	Well, the trace lab found venom proteins in his coffee cup.	N
475	475	475	00:32:26	00:32:28	Could that have killed him?	N
476	476	476	00:32:28	00:32:34	Well, I know a lot of hot shots who drink the stuff-- manly, daredevil B.S.-- and they're still alive.	N
477	477	477	00:32:34	00:32:41	Because typically, the stomach acids would kill the venom before it reached the bloodstream, but if you had an ulcer...	N
478	478	478	00:32:41	00:32:44	Hmm, then you're seriously screwed.	N
479	479	479	00:32:44	00:32:47	Was there an abnormal tissue death? Necrosis?	N
480	480	480	00:32:48	00:32:49	No.	N
481	481	481	00:32:49	00:32:50	That rules out his Diamondback Rattlesnake.	N
482	482	482	00:32:51	00:32:53	Rattler venom's hemotoxic.	N
483	483	483	00:32:53	00:32:57	It means it predigests the tissue before swallowing.	N
484	484	484	00:32:58	00:33:02	Well, the ELISA test came back positive for alpha-neurotoxins.	N
485	485	485	00:33:02	00:33:06	Well, your guy likes them mean.	N
486	486	486	00:33:06	00:33:09	These other two could've done the job, both neurotoxic.	N
487	487	487	00:33:09	00:33:12	Which would send the body into complete and total paralysis, right?	N
488	488	488	00:33:12	00:33:17	Explaining why the victim ended up in the morgue the first time.	N
489	489	489	00:33:17	00:33:21	Okay, blood from the bedroom chair and the kitchen belong to Mom.	N
490	490	490	00:33:21	00:33:22	That's what I figured.	N
491	491	491	00:33:22	00:33:27	Hair from the freezer-- nicely preserved, by the way-- and hairs from the bedroom pillow, also the victim's.	N
492	492	492	00:33:27	00:33:33	Okay, this is all great, but, uh, why the 9-1-1 page?	N
493	493	493	00:33:33	00:33:36	The moral of my story-- share and share alleles.	N
494	494	494	00:33:36	00:33:40	Pubic hairs in the bed, not Mom's.	N
495	495	495	00:33:41	00:33:45	The daughter.	N
496	496	496	00:33:45	00:33:48	Dad did have a new girlfriend.	N
497	497	497	00:33:51	00:33:53	The bracelet was a gift.	N
498	498	498	00:33:53	00:33:56	From your father.	N
499	499	499	00:33:56	00:34:01	Diamonds and platinum, that's, uh, pretty fancy.	N
500	500	500	00:34:01	00:34:03	Guess he thought I deserved it.	N
501	501	501	00:34:03	00:34:06	Why?	N
502	502	502	00:34:06	00:34:09	For taking care of everything.	N
503	503	503	00:34:11	00:34:12	Everything?	N
504	504	504	00:34:12	00:34:19	Laundry, groceries, carpool for Charlie...	N
505	505	505	00:34:19	00:34:21	Is that it?	N
506	506	506	00:34:27	00:34:28	Nora...	N
507	507	507	00:34:29	00:34:35	I'd really like to help you and your brother, but I can't unless you talk to me.	N
508	508	508	00:34:41	00:34:45	We found evidence of you in your father's bed.	N
509	509	509	00:34:51	00:34:53	My father loves me.	N
510	510	510	00:35:01	00:35:04	Oh, my God.	N
511	511	511	00:35:07	00:35:09	Are you lactating?	N
512	512	512	00:35:12	00:35:14	You're pregnant.	N
513	513	513	00:35:23	00:35:26	You sick son of a bitch.	N
514	514	514	00:35:26	00:35:29	Did you think we weren't going to find out she was pregnant?	N
515	515	515	00:35:29	00:35:31	Who?	N
516	516	516	00:35:31	00:35:32	Oh, stop it. Your daughter.	N
517	517	517	00:35:32	00:35:34	Nora is pregnant?	N
518	518	518	00:35:34	00:35:36	Cut the clueless routine.	N
519	519	519	00:35:36	00:35:37	What are you accusing me of?	N
520	520	520	00:35:40	00:35:41	Daniel!	N
521	521	521	00:35:43	00:35:46	Your wife came back and saw what you were doing.	N
522	522	522	00:35:46	00:35:51	So, you killed her, and you tried to buy off your daughter with a diamond bracelet.	N
523	523	523	00:35:51	00:35:53	I bought that for my wife.	N
524	524	524	00:35:53	00:35:55	Your daughter's telling a different story.	N
525	525	525	00:35:55	00:35:57	Nora? How could she even know about...	N
526	526	526	00:35:57	00:35:59	I'm going to nail you for murder.	N
527	527	527	00:36:03	00:36:05	What do you mean, None?	N
528	528	528	00:36:05	00:36:09	Well, venom's like perfume-- highly specific recipe.	N
529	529	529	00:36:09	00:36:12	Protein ratios vary from species to species, even snake to snake.	N
530	530	530	00:36:12	00:36:17	The protein level of your three hoses doesn't match the sample taken from the vic's coffee cup.	N
531	531	531	00:36:17	00:36:19	So, Marty was telling the truth?	N
532	532	532	00:36:19	00:36:23	It was just a coincidence that he owns poisonous snakes, and his co-worker was envenomated.	N
533	533	533	00:36:23	00:36:26	A coincidence is a scientific anomaly.	N
534	534	534	00:36:27	00:36:29	Maybe he just got rid of the snake.	N
535	535	535	00:36:36	00:36:38	Girl called all hysterical.	N
536	536	536	00:36:38	00:36:40	Said a snake ate her dog.	N
537	537	537	00:36:40	00:36:42	It's a monacled cobra-- it's not indigenous.	N
538	538	538	00:36:42	00:36:43	Comes from southeast Asia.	N
539	539	539	00:36:44	00:36:45	I asked her where she got it from.	N
540	540	540	00:36:45	00:36:48	She said her co-worker asked her to snake-sit.	N
541	541	541	00:36:48	00:36:50	Marty Gibson.	N
542	542	542	00:36:50	00:36:52	Mm-hmm.	N
543	543	543	00:36:55	00:36:58	You're that guy from the crime lab.	N
544	544	544	00:36:59	00:37:00	Well, you're a little late.	N
545	545	545	00:37:00	00:37:10	Bastard told me he had a sure-fire way to win the Cabo trip, and that he'd take me with him if I just watched his snake for a couple of days.	N
546	546	546	00:37:10	00:37:14	I can't believe what an idiot I am.	N
547	547	547	00:37:14	00:37:17	Never trust a car salesman.	N
548	548	548	00:37:17	00:37:19	What else did you do for Marty?	N
549	549	549	00:37:23	00:37:25	Well, not that.	N
550	550	550	00:37:25	00:37:27	Did you get him coffee?	N
551	551	551	00:37:27	00:37:30	Oh, well, now I do.	N
552	552	552	00:37:30	00:37:31	Now you do?	N
553	553	553	00:37:31	00:37:40	Yeah. It used to be Marty, the goodwill guy who got coffee for everybody else, but now, since Fred's dead, he's moved up a desk.	N
554	554	554	00:37:40	00:37:41	The goodwill guy?	N
555	555	555	00:37:41	00:37:42	Yeah.	N
556	556	556	00:37:42	00:37:47	The guy with no client list of his own, has to live off the hand-me-downs of the others.	N
557	557	557	00:37:47	00:37:50	Hey, Marty, uh, sure could use another refill.	N
558	558	558	00:37:50	00:37:51	You want anything?	N
559	559	559	00:37:51	00:37:52	Easy on the sugar.	N
560	560	560	00:37:52	00:37:53	Coming right up.	N
561	561	561	00:37:55	00:37:58	Well, sometimes access is all you need.	N
562	562	562	00:38:07	00:38:09	Nanci.	N
563	563	563	00:38:09	00:38:11	Do you know what a syllogism is, Mr. Gibson?	N
564	564	564	00:38:11	00:38:13	Sylla-what?	N
565	565	565	00:38:13	00:38:14	A syllogism.	N
566	566	566	00:38:14	00:38:15	Aristotelian logic.	N
567	567	567	00:38:15	00:38:17	Two premises equal one conclusion.	N
568	568	568	00:38:17	00:38:18	A plus B equals C.	N
569	569	569	00:38:18	00:38:19	Right.	N
570	570	570	00:38:19	00:38:20	So, you're the snake guy.	N
571	571	571	00:38:20	00:38:22	You're also the goodwill guy who gets the coffee.	N
572	572	572	00:38:22	00:38:26	So, when someone is poisoned with snake venom in their coffee, A plus B equals you.	N
573	573	573	00:38:26	00:38:30	I busted my ass out on this floor to get a desk up there, and for what?	N
574	574	574	00:38:30	00:38:31	So Fred can make me his bitch?	N
575	575	575	00:38:31	00:38:32	So you kill him?	N
576	576	576	00:38:32	00:38:33	Fred killed himself.	N
577	577	577	00:38:33	00:38:34	Guy was like a goldfish.	N
578	578	578	00:38:34	00:38:37	He would have eaten himself to death before he tossed me a client.	N
579	579	579	00:38:37	00:38:39	And one good client breeds seven more.	N
580	580	580	00:38:39	00:38:41	Without the one, I keep slipping.	N
581	581	581	00:38:41	00:38:43	There's two directions in this business-- up and out.	N
582	582	582	00:38:43	00:38:44	It's a numbers game.	N
583	583	583	00:38:44	00:38:46	I'm 35 years old.	N
584	584	584	00:38:46	00:38:47	I got six guys ready to move me out.	N
585	585	585	00:38:47	00:38:49	Opportunity knocks, you open the door.	N
586	586	586	00:38:49	00:38:51	I guess it's just too bad he had an ulcer.	N
587	587	587	00:38:54	00:38:55	Who doesn't?	N
588	588	588	00:38:59	00:39:03	Okay, if I can just have you lay back.	N
589	589	589	00:39:03	00:39:06	All right, Nora, I'm going to need you to relax.	N
590	590	590	00:39:09	00:39:12	Okay, now take a deep breath.	N
591	591	591	00:39:14	00:39:16	Good.	N
592	592	592	00:39:16	00:39:20	All right, another deep breath.	N
593	593	593	00:39:28	00:39:29	She's a virgin?	N
594	594	594	00:39:29	00:39:32	What are we talking about, an immaculate conception?	N
595	595	595	00:39:32	00:39:35	More like the immaculate perception.	N
596	596	596	00:39:35	00:39:38	Pseudocyesis-- imagined pregnancy.	N
597	597	597	00:39:38	00:39:41	It's all in her head?	N
598	598	598	00:39:41	00:39:47	Well, that would explain what she was doing in Dad's bed.	N
599	599	599	00:39:47	00:39:49	Fantasizing.	N
600	600	600	00:39:49	00:39:51	Wow.	N
601	601	601	00:39:51	00:39:59	When the desire to become pregnant is so strong hormone levels can change, setting off all the biological signs of pregnancy.	N
602	602	602	00:39:59	00:40:00	It kind of makes sense.	N
603	603	603	00:40:00	00:40:03	Hormones travel the same channels as adrenaline.	N
604	604	604	00:40:03	00:40:10	Swollen abdomen, lack of menstruation, and sometimes bilateral galactorrhea.	N
605	605	605	00:40:10	00:40:13	Milk production in both breasts.	N
606	606	606	00:40:13	00:40:16	Leaking can be brought on by stress.	N
607	607	607	00:40:17	00:40:26	Emotional or physical stimuli cause prolactin to shoot through the endocrine system, ending in the mammary glands, and triggering the cells to lactate.	N
608	608	608	00:40:26	00:40:28	The father was clueless.	N
609	609	609	00:40:28	00:40:30	About all the women in his life.	N
610	610	610	00:40:30	00:40:32	Hey, hey.	N
611	611	611	00:40:32	00:40:34	Check out these photos.	N
612	612	612	00:40:34	00:40:41	The two stains on the inside of the shirt we found at the dump tested positive for Nora, but the stains on the outside, bloodstains, are definitely Mom's.	N
613	613	613	00:40:41	00:40:43	The bracelet was Mom's.	N
614	614	614	00:40:43	00:40:45	Greg checked the epithelials.	N
615	615	615	00:40:45	00:40:49	Nora's in love with her father, in an Electra kind of way.	N
616	616	616	00:40:52	00:40:54	Nora, is this your shirt?	N
617	617	617	00:40:54	00:40:56	Yes.	N
618	618	618	00:40:58	00:41:01	Can you explain to me how your mother's blood ended up on it?	N
619	619	619	00:41:05	00:41:07	No idea how it got there?	N
620	620	620	00:41:09	00:41:11	No.	N
621	621	621	00:41:14	00:41:18	Well, you told me that this bracelet was a gift from your father.	N
622	622	622	00:41:18	00:41:21	He claims that he bought it for your mother.	N
623	623	623	00:41:21	00:41:22	Oh, no.	N
624	624	624	00:41:22	00:41:25	It's mine.	N
625	625	625	00:41:25	00:41:28	I think you feel the same way about your father.	N
626	626	626	00:41:57	00:41:59	Guess who's back?	N
627	627	627	00:42:12	00:42:17	And then you put your mother in the freezer and you waited until trash day.	N
628	628	628	00:42:20	00:42:22	That's a horrible story.	N
629	629	629	00:42:23	00:42:24	It's not a story.	N
630	630	630	00:42:24	00:42:27	It's what the evidence tells us really happened.	N
631	631	631	00:42:27	00:42:31	What kind of a mother would do that?	N
632	632	632	00:42:31	00:42:33	I'm helpful.	N
633	633	633	00:42:33	00:42:35	I do what needs to be done.	N
634	634	634	00:42:35	00:42:37	I know. You take care of things.	N
635	635	635	00:42:37	00:42:40	I never ask for anything!	N
636	636	636	00:42:40	00:42:43	And all you wanted was the one thing that you couldn't have.	N
637	637	637	00:42:43	00:42:45	It's not my fault.	N
638	638	638	00:42:45	00:42:46	I'm innocent.	N
639	639	639	00:42:48	00:42:50	You were innocent, Nora.	N
640	640	640	00:42:50	00:42:52	You're not anymore.	N
641	641	641	00:42:57	00:42:58	What are you doing?	N
642	642	642	00:42:59	00:43:02	You're under arrest for the murder of Kelly Easton.	N
643	643	643	00:43:02	00:43:04	No, but I'm going to have a baby!	N
644	644	644	00:43:07	00:43:09	Well, she's going to retain an attorney.	N
645	645	645	00:43:10	00:43:12	He's going to advise her to plead insanity.	N
646	646	646	00:43:12	00:43:14	Good defense.	N
647	647	647	00:43:15	00:43:17	Yeah.	N
648	648	648	00:43:18	00:43:20	Have you ever seen anything like this before?	N
649	649	649	00:43:21	00:43:24	How it manifested? No.	N
650	650	650	00:43:24	00:43:28	But the cause?	N
651	651	651	00:43:28	00:43:31	People throw things away every day.	N
