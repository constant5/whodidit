0	0	0	00:00:13	00:00:17	( women laughing ) We are just warming up, my girl.	N
1	1	1	00:00:17	00:00:19	Wait, wait, wait.	N
2	2	2	00:00:19	00:00:20	I don't think this is the right way.	N
3	3	3	00:00:20	00:00:21	It's a shortcut.	N
4	4	4	00:00:21	00:00:23	A shortcut? To where?	N
5	5	5	00:00:24	00:00:25	( thumping ) Stop.	N
6	6	6	00:00:25	00:00:27	Stop the car.	N
7	7	7	00:00:27	00:00:29	It was just a pothole.	N
8	8	8	00:00:29	00:00:31	I think you hit someone.	N
9	9	9	00:00:45	00:00:47	The blonde behind the wheel.	N
10	10	10	00:00:47	00:00:49	Girlfriend in the passenger seat called it in.	N
11	11	11	00:00:49	00:00:53	Vehicular manslaughter.	N
12	12	12	00:00:55	00:00:56	Taillight?	N
13	13	13	00:00:57	00:00:58	Yeah.	N
14	14	14	00:01:00	00:01:03	Have you been drinking, Warrick?	N
15	15	15	00:01:03	00:01:05	No, I'm having a block party.	N
16	16	16	00:01:05	00:01:09	I marked it where I found it-- over on the sidewalk over there.	N
17	17	17	00:01:34	00:01:40	Two distinct tire treads-- one wide...	N
18	18	18	00:01:40	00:01:47	one narrow. Given the extensive bruising from the wide tread mark the victim was killed by a larger vehicle, not a compact.	N
19	19	19	00:01:47	00:01:53	Hey, O'Riley I wouldn't book those suspects just yet.	N
20	20	20	00:01:53	00:01:56	I think they ran over a corpse.	N
21	21	21	00:02:32	00:02:34	Yo.	N
22	22	22	00:02:36	00:02:41	What's up? We got a call about ten minutes ago-- a shooting at Vegas Grounds Coffee Shop, Eighth and Main.	N
23	23	23	00:02:41	00:02:42	Multiple fatalities.	N
24	24	24	00:02:42	00:02:44	We want this one. You guys get over there.	N
25	25	25	00:02:44	00:02:45	Keep me in the loop.	N
26	26	26	00:02:45	00:02:47	Keep the media out of it. Right.	N
27	27	27	00:02:47	00:02:52	Hey, remember about three months ago I applied to the American Academy meeting in Chicago?	N
28	28	28	00:02:52	00:02:55	Well, the deadline for your approval is end of shift today.	N
29	29	29	00:02:55	00:02:56	It's not a problem.	N
30	30	30	00:02:56	00:02:58	There's important papers...	N
31	31	31	00:02:58	00:02:59	You don't have to explain-- consider it done.	N
32	32	32	00:02:59	00:03:01	Thank you.	N
33	33	33	00:03:01	00:03:02	Good luck.	N
34	34	34	00:03:02	00:03:04	Printed your hit-and-run.	N
35	35	35	00:03:04	00:03:09	AFIS found a match-- Brian Clemonds, 22 born in Vegas, and he's deaf.	N
36	36	36	00:03:09	00:03:11	You can tell he's deaf by his fingerprints?	N
37	37	37	00:03:11	00:03:15	Actually, yes-- he was printed as part of a state aid program in '81.	N
38	38	38	00:03:15	00:03:19	To confirm, I examined his ear canal.	N
39	39	39	00:03:19	00:03:29	Normally, the malleus is shaped like a hammer-- a long, smooth handle connecting to a blunt head-- but Brian's malleus is knotted, both of them-- birth defect.	N
40	40	40	00:03:29	00:03:32	There's a college for the deaf about a mile from where we found him.	N
41	41	41	00:03:32	00:03:37	So, Brian takes a walk crosses the street, doesn't hear the car, gets creamed.	N
42	42	42	00:03:37	00:03:42	The vehicle-- probably a truck or an SUV, based on the width of the tire tread-- takes off.	N
43	43	43	00:03:42	00:03:47	Later, along comes a compact-- thump-- runs over his dead body.	N
44	44	44	00:03:47	00:03:49	Maybe, maybe not.	N
45	45	45	00:03:50	00:03:52	See the dried blood on his knuckles?	N
46	46	46	00:03:52	00:03:53	No associated wounding.	N
47	47	47	00:03:54	00:03:55	Blood's probably not his.	N
48	48	48	00:03:55	00:03:58	You know what that means-- Smackdown-- the kid was in a fight.	N
49	49	49	00:03:58	00:04:00	That ended in murder.	N
50	50	50	00:04:00	00:04:02	Did you send a sample of his blood to DNA?	N
51	51	51	00:04:02	00:04:05	When you find the suspect you'll nail him with his own body fluid.	N
52	52	52	00:04:05	00:04:07	Has his family been notified?	N
53	53	53	00:04:07	00:04:08	Not yet.	N
54	54	54	00:04:14	00:04:17	One person dead, it's a shame; more than one's a party.	N
55	55	55	00:04:17	00:04:19	Get ready to pull a double.	N
56	56	56	00:04:49	00:04:54	Papa Roach. Couldn't hear a bomb go off over this.	N
57	57	57	00:04:54	00:04:56	Welcome to the caffeine wars.	N
58	58	58	00:04:56	00:04:58	We got four dead, one on the way to the hospital.	N
59	59	59	00:04:58	00:05:00	The kid who belonged to those headphones.	N
60	60	60	00:05:00	00:05:02	I count two-- where are the others?	N
61	61	61	00:05:02	00:05:06	One behind the counter; one in the back room. Guy wasn't light with the ammo.	N
62	62	62	00:05:06	00:05:07	This place is raining shell casings.	N
63	63	63	00:05:10	00:05:11	Hey, I know this guy.	N
64	64	64	00:05:11	00:05:13	I bet you do. Who doesn't know Frankie Flynn?	N
65	65	65	00:05:13	00:05:15	Used to own the Orpheus.	N
66	66	66	00:05:15	00:05:17	Lost his gaming license a couple of years ago.	N
67	67	67	00:05:17	00:05:20	Oh, yeah. Too many dips in the chips.	N
68	68	68	00:05:20	00:05:22	Yeah, you got that right. Who's the muscle?	N
69	69	69	00:05:22	00:05:25	This is, uh, Al Robson Frankie Flynn's bodyguard.	N
70	70	70	00:05:25	00:05:28	Cash taken? Till's full and all the wallets are accounted for.	N
71	71	71	00:05:28	00:05:32	I don't think anyone was interested in the, uh, cash... or the coffee.	N
72	72	72	00:05:32	00:05:36	You're thinking hit?	N
73	73	73	00:05:36	00:05:39	Maybe. Frankie drives a bullet-proof car.	N
74	74	74	00:05:39	00:05:41	What does that tell you?	N
75	75	75	00:05:43	00:05:47	She's probably still in high school.	N
76	76	76	00:06:01	00:06:03	Bless her heart.	N
77	77	77	00:06:08	00:06:16	Assuming Flynn was the target and it was a hit the shooter followed Flynn in the front door...	N
78	78	78	00:06:16	00:06:18	shot the muscle first...	N
79	79	79	00:06:19	00:06:21	then Flynn...	N
80	80	80	00:06:21	00:06:24	and some poor kid minding his own business.	N
81	81	81	00:06:25	00:06:27	The girls were last.	N
82	82	82	00:06:31	00:06:33	Four dead.	N
83	83	83	00:06:33	00:06:36	One is still alive.	N
84	84	84	00:06:40	00:06:42	Make that five.	N
85	85	85	00:06:42	00:06:44	Guy died on the way to the hospital.	N
86	86	86	00:06:51	00:06:52	Mrs. Clemonds?	N
87	87	87	00:06:52	00:06:53	Yes?	N
88	88	88	00:06:54	00:06:55	My name is Gil Grissom.	N
89	89	89	00:06:55	00:06:56	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
90	90	90	00:06:57	00:06:59	Crime Lab?	N
91	91	91	00:06:59	00:07:01	May I come in for a minute?	N
92	92	92	00:07:01	00:07:03	Okay.	N
93	93	93	00:07:12	00:07:13	My son is deaf.	N
94	94	94	00:07:13	00:07:16	That bell is connected to the doorbell.	N
95	95	95	00:07:16	00:07:21	The bell sets off vibrations which reverberate on the floorboards so that he knows someone's at the door.	N
96	96	96	00:07:21	00:07:25	Yes.	N
97	97	97	00:07:26	00:07:29	Mrs. Clemonds, I'm here about your son Brian.	N
98	98	98	00:07:31	00:07:34	There's no easy way to say this.	N
99	99	99	00:07:36	00:07:40	Oh, God, please, no.	N
100	100	100	00:07:41	00:07:44	Brian was killed tonight.	N
101	101	101	00:07:44	00:07:48	No, no... no...	N
102	102	102	00:07:55	00:07:56	This is my fault.	N
103	103	103	00:07:56	00:07:59	No. No, it's not.	N
104	104	104	00:07:59	00:08:05	When I was pregnant, I had the German measles and the virus took away his hearing.	N
105	105	105	00:08:05	00:08:06	It's my fault.	N
106	106	106	00:08:06	00:08:09	No, Mrs. Clemonds...	N
107	107	107	00:08:09	00:08:11	we think he might have been murdered.	N
108	108	108	00:08:11	00:08:13	Murdered?	N
109	109	109	00:08:15	00:08:19	Would you like to talk to a family services counselor?	N
110	110	110	00:08:20	00:08:23	Talking is overrated, Mr. Grissom.	N
111	111	111	00:08:24	00:08:28	Just find out who did this to my boy.	N
112	112	112	00:08:28	00:08:30	Please.	N
113	113	113	00:08:30	00:08:32	It's been a hell of a night.	N
114	114	114	00:08:32	00:08:34	First the deaf kid, now a hit.	N
115	115	115	00:08:34	00:08:36	It's going to take a while to process all the bodies.	N
116	116	116	00:08:36	00:08:38	What do you know about Flynn?	N
117	117	117	00:08:38	00:08:40	I always start with the celebrities.	N
118	118	118	00:08:40	00:08:45	Frankie Flynn, 38 gunshot wounds to the head and the abdomen. Any bullets recovered?	N
119	119	119	00:08:45	00:08:48	Only one, out of the head-- uh, nine-millimeter .357.	N
120	120	120	00:08:48	00:08:50	I deal with the pin cushions.	N
121	121	121	00:08:50	00:08:53	Ballistics deals with the pins.	N
122	122	122	00:08:53	00:08:56	Shooter could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd waited a month or two.	N
123	123	123	00:08:56	00:08:58	Why?	N
124	124	124	00:08:58	00:08:59	Invasive colon cancer.	N
125	125	125	00:08:59	00:09:01	On his way out.	N
126	126	126	00:09:01	00:09:02	Guess he got off easy.	N
127	127	127	00:09:05	00:09:07	I.D.?	N
128	128	128	00:09:07	00:09:09	Erin McCarty, 20.	N
129	129	129	00:09:09	00:09:11	Wonder if she even knew she was pregnant.	N
130	130	130	00:09:11	00:09:14	Just keeps getting better.	N
131	131	131	00:09:14	00:09:16	Someone notify the husband?	N
132	132	132	00:09:16	00:09:19	Cop said she's single-- she lives at home with her mother.	N
133	133	133	00:09:19	00:09:22	How far along was she?	N
134	134	134	00:09:22	00:09:25	About six weeks. She knew.	N
135	135	135	00:09:42	00:09:46	Another nine-millimeter, just like our casings.	N
136	136	136	00:09:46	00:09:50	Nine bullets, all the same caliber.	N
137	137	137	00:09:50	00:09:52	Looks like Robson never got a shot off.	N
138	138	138	00:09:52	00:09:55	I wouldn't want him as my bodyguard.	N
139	139	139	00:09:55	00:09:56	Need help with the measurements?	N
140	140	140	00:09:56	00:09:58	Sure.	N
141	141	141	00:09:58	00:10:00	Captain, I got the manager outside.	N
142	142	142	00:10:00	00:10:02	Okay.	N
143	143	143	00:10:02	00:10:04	That's the guy right there.	N
144	144	144	00:10:04	00:10:05	This one?	N
145	145	145	00:10:05	00:10:07	Yep, that's the one.	N
146	146	146	00:10:09	00:10:12	I'm Detective Brass. Catherine Willows.	N
147	147	147	00:10:12	00:10:14	Nick Stokes from the Crime Lab.	N
148	148	148	00:10:14	00:10:16	Brad Kendall. I heard it on the news.	N
149	149	149	00:10:16	00:10:18	They're saying it was some kind of a hit.	N
150	150	150	00:10:18	00:10:19	Where are Erin and Alice?	N
151	151	151	00:10:21	00:10:23	They didn't make it.	N
152	152	152	00:10:27	00:10:30	Wait... Did you call their parents?	N
153	153	153	00:10:30	00:10:32	Once the coroner makes a positive I.D.	N
154	154	154	00:10:32	00:10:34	their families will be notified.	N
155	155	155	00:10:34	00:10:38	Shooting occurred around closing time.	N
156	156	156	00:10:38	00:10:41	Is it customary for your employees to close up?	N
157	157	157	00:10:42	00:10:46	00 on the nose.	N
158	158	158	00:10:46	00:10:49	She was training Alice, moving on at the end of the month.	N
159	159	159	00:10:49	00:10:52	I can't believe they're gone.	N
160	160	160	00:10:54	00:10:57	Dr. Gilbert, we need your help.	N
161	161	161	00:10:59	00:11:00	Brian Clemonds was murdered.	N
162	162	162	00:11:02	00:11:05	Was he having any difficulties?	N
163	163	163	00:11:07	00:11:10	Anyone have a grudge against him?	N
164	164	164	00:11:12	00:11:17	We understand you don't want a homicide investigation upsetting your students.	N
165	165	165	00:11:17	00:11:20	I'm severely deaf, and I can communicate fine.	N
166	166	166	00:11:20	00:11:23	I'd appreciate it if you'd look at me when you speak to me.	N
167	167	167	00:11:23	00:11:25	I wear a hearing aid and I can read lips.	N
168	168	168	00:11:25	00:11:29	You could have asked if I needed an interpreter.	N
169	169	169	00:11:29	00:11:32	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.	N
170	170	170	00:11:32	00:11:35	There are 152 students at my school.	N
171	171	171	00:11:35	00:11:39	We live together; we study together; we eat together.	N
172	172	172	00:11:39	00:11:41	We're a family.	N
173	173	173	00:11:41	00:11:43	And Brian is dead.	N
174	174	174	00:11:45	00:11:48	Dr. Gilbert, we're just following protocol.	N
175	175	175	00:11:48	00:11:53	We need to speak with Brian's friends, his roommates.	N
176	176	176	00:11:53	00:11:55	We'll also need access to his records.	N
177	177	177	00:11:55	00:11:57	The crime didn't happen here-- it happened out there.	N
178	178	178	00:11:57	00:11:59	I'm not accusing anybody of anything.	N
179	179	179	00:11:59	00:12:02	Neither am I, but there are more of you, right?	N
180	180	180	00:12:02	00:12:10	Send someone else, someone with more understanding of this school of my students.	N
181	181	181	00:12:10	00:12:13	But we're here now, and evidence is time sensitive.	N
182	182	182	00:12:13	00:12:17	How can you solve a crime without understanding the victim?	N
183	183	183	00:12:23	00:12:25	Um, she's kicking us out.	N
184	184	184	00:12:49	00:12:50	Hey.	N
185	185	185	00:12:50	00:12:52	How'd it go at the college?	N
186	186	186	00:12:52	00:12:53	They're not cooperating.	N
187	187	187	00:12:53	00:12:56	Yeah, we didn't have a warrant, so she kicked us out.	N
188	188	188	00:12:56	00:12:57	What did you do? What did we do?	N
189	189	189	00:12:57	00:13:00	We met with the president, asked a few questions.	N
190	190	190	00:13:00	00:13:01	She was kind of hostile.	N
191	191	191	00:13:01	00:13:03	Like it's our fault we can hear.	N
192	192	192	00:13:03	00:13:05	All right. Let's go.	N
193	193	193	00:13:13	00:13:14	Dr. Gilbert?	N
194	194	194	00:13:15	00:13:16	I'm Gil Grissom with the Crime Lab.	N
195	195	195	00:13:16	00:13:18	You kicked my people out of your office.	N
196	196	196	00:13:18	00:13:20	Well, I'm kicking you out, too.	N
197	197	197	00:13:24	00:13:27	Look, your student is dead.	N
198	198	198	00:13:27	00:13:32	Don't you want to know who's responsible? I do.	N
199	199	199	00:13:32	00:13:35	Your people can't solve this crime.	N
200	200	200	00:13:35	00:13:38	Why? 'Cause they don't understand the victim?	N
201	201	201	00:13:39	00:13:42	Help them understand.	N
202	202	202	00:13:42	00:13:47	When a deaf person meets a hearing person the hearing person so much as says, I'm normal, you're not.	N
203	203	203	00:13:47	00:13:51	Is that what you think I'm saying?	N
204	204	204	00:13:51	00:13:54	A student is dead.	N
205	205	205	00:13:54	00:13:57	Maybe you feel responsible.	N
206	206	206	00:13:57	00:13:59	Maybe you're angry.	N
207	207	207	00:13:59	00:14:02	But don't be angry at us.	N
208	208	208	00:14:02	00:14:06	We want to help you.	N
209	209	209	00:14:06	00:14:10	If I agree to cooperate you will include me in your investigation?	N
210	210	210	00:14:10	00:14:12	Yes, I will.	N
211	211	211	00:14:12	00:14:14	I welcome your involvement.	N
212	212	212	00:14:14	00:14:17	Now...	N
213	213	213	00:14:17	00:14:20	may I see Brian Clemonds' file? Please?	N
214	214	214	00:14:23	00:14:25	I did nothing wrong.	N
215	215	215	00:14:25	00:14:29	Brian filed six complaints against his roommate Paul Arrington.	N
216	216	216	00:14:29	00:14:33	Paul lost his hearing less than a year ago-- a tumor.	N
217	217	217	00:14:33	00:14:35	He hasn't adjusted. He's angry.	N
218	218	218	00:14:35	00:14:36	And he took it out on Brian.	N
219	219	219	00:14:36	00:14:38	Assaulted him.	N
220	220	220	00:14:39	00:14:40	Brian requested a new roommate.	N
221	221	221	00:14:40	00:14:42	Request denied?	N
222	222	222	00:14:42	00:14:45	There were no other available beds.	N
223	223	223	00:14:45	00:14:47	I want to speak to Paul.	N
224	224	224	00:14:47	00:14:49	He doesn't read lips or sign.	N
225	225	225	00:14:49	00:14:53	You don't need to hear or speak to communicate.	N
226	226	226	00:14:54	00:14:57	Or... commit murder.	N
227	227	227	00:15:04	00:15:08	So, you going to tell us how you learned to sign?	N
228	228	228	00:15:08	00:15:10	No.	N
229	229	229	00:15:11	00:15:14	Well, the president of the college is a real wack job.	N
230	230	230	00:15:14	00:15:16	Sara, you see deafness as a pathology.	N
231	231	231	00:15:17	00:15:20	For Dr. Gilbert, her deafness is not her handicap it's her way of life.	N
232	232	232	00:15:20	00:15:22	You know, I think you might be siding with her.	N
233	233	233	00:15:22	00:15:27	As long as you see this as us versus them, you're going to have problems on this case.	N
234	234	234	00:15:34	00:15:37	This explains what we're doing.	N
235	235	235	00:15:42	00:15:43	What was that all about?	N
236	236	236	00:15:43	00:15:45	Grissom signs.	N
237	237	237	00:15:45	00:15:48	Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?	N
238	238	238	00:15:48	00:15:49	He goes out?	N
239	239	239	00:15:49	00:15:51	Exactly-- who knows anything about that guy?	N
240	240	240	00:15:53	00:15:53	Hey, check that out.	N
241	241	241	00:15:53	00:15:56	Oh, I've read about this machine.	N
242	242	242	00:15:56	00:15:58	Very Frankenstein.	N
243	243	243	00:15:58	00:15:59	Brain printing.	N
244	244	244	00:15:59	00:16:01	They call it a visual polygraph.	N
245	245	245	00:16:01	00:16:04	You've used one of these before?	N
246	246	246	00:16:04	00:16:08	Yeah, back in '97 Grissom and I used one to interview this rapist.	N
247	247	247	00:16:08	00:16:12	The guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear.	N
248	248	248	00:16:13	00:16:17	So, you show the suspect slides of the crime scene and if he's our guy...	N
249	249	249	00:16:18	00:16:20	the oscillator will give him away.	N
250	250	250	00:16:35	00:16:37	Good, he recollects you.	N
251	251	251	00:16:45	00:16:46	He recollects the college.	N
252	252	252	00:16:54	00:16:56	He recollects Brian.	N
253	253	253	00:17:06	00:17:08	No recollection.	N
254	254	254	00:17:27	00:17:32	No recollection of the crime scene or of Brian under these conditions.	N
255	255	255	00:17:32	00:17:33	May we go now?	N
256	256	256	00:18:00	00:18:04	If you want to find the killer look outside the school.	N
257	257	257	00:18:34	00:18:35	Grissom!	N
258	258	258	00:18:41	00:18:43	Sorry.	N
259	259	259	00:18:43	00:18:44	I was thinking.	N
260	260	260	00:18:44	00:18:46	About what it's like to be deaf?	N
261	261	261	00:18:46	00:18:47	About what it's like to hear.	N
262	262	262	00:18:49	00:18:53	Sara told me that you spoke in sign and now you're putting plugs in your ears.	N
263	263	263	00:18:53	00:18:55	I'm on a case. Mm-hmm.	N
264	264	264	00:18:55	00:18:57	Is that why you forgot about the conference?	N
265	265	265	00:18:58	00:19:00	The what?	N
266	266	266	00:19:00	00:19:01	You missed the deadline.	N
267	267	267	00:19:01	00:19:03	No Chicago for me.	N
268	268	268	00:19:03	00:19:05	Oh, Catherine...	N
269	269	269	00:19:05	00:19:06	This is the one meeting I needed to attend.	N
270	270	270	00:19:06	00:19:09	I don't always want to be second banana.	N
271	271	271	00:19:09	00:19:10	I can probably do your job.	N
272	272	272	00:19:10	00:19:11	I know that I can do Ecklie's.	N
273	273	273	00:19:11	00:19:12	I forgot.	N
274	274	274	00:19:12	00:19:14	I'm so sorry.	N
275	275	275	00:19:14	00:19:19	Make sure to submit the paperwork by the end of the day.	N
276	276	276	00:19:19	00:19:21	I thought you said that it was too late.	N
277	277	277	00:19:21	00:19:24	Well, I knew you'd forget so I upped the deadline, gave you a buffer.	N
278	278	278	00:19:26	00:19:28	Don't forget again.	N
279	279	279	00:19:38	00:19:40	Those the tire treads from the crime scene?	N
280	280	280	00:19:40	00:19:47	I photoed the victim's torso and imaged the tread mark-- scanned it got it running through a Tread Assistance CD ROM.	N
281	281	281	00:19:47	00:19:48	Any hits?	N
282	282	282	00:19:48	00:19:49	Not yet.	N
283	283	283	00:19:49	00:19:52	CD database-- 11,033 patterns.	N
284	284	284	00:19:52	00:19:54	Could take a while.	N
285	285	285	00:19:54	00:19:55	Yeah.	N
286	286	286	00:19:55	00:19:57	What are you doing?	N
287	287	287	00:19:57	00:19:58	Checking out the dead guy's clothes.	N
288	288	288	00:20:08	00:20:10	Whoa.	N
289	289	289	00:20:10	00:20:11	What are these?	N
290	290	290	00:20:18	00:20:20	What?	N
291	291	291	00:20:20	00:20:21	They look like lice.	N
292	292	292	00:20:21	00:20:22	Lice?	N
293	293	293	00:20:24	00:20:26	Wasn't our dead guy clean?	N
294	294	294	00:20:26	00:20:28	Yeah, he was.	N
295	295	295	00:20:28	00:20:32	Lice adhere to hair follicles-- I didn't find any stray hairs on him.	N
296	296	296	00:20:32	00:20:34	Well, he was in a fight, right?	N
297	297	297	00:20:35	00:20:43	Maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on his sweater and they got comfy and the stray hair blew away.	N
298	298	298	00:20:45	00:20:47	Hey.	N
299	299	299	00:20:47	00:20:49	Any luck on the tire treads?	N
300	300	300	00:20:49	00:20:52	Computer's still processing but Warrick found something pretty interesting.	N
301	301	301	00:20:52	00:20:55	You know anything about lice?	N
302	302	302	00:20:55	00:20:57	Yeah, they make your head itch.	N
303	303	303	00:20:57	00:21:01	And after head colds the most common medical problem affecting children.	N
304	304	304	00:21:01	00:21:03	Little problem no one talks about, huh?	N
305	305	305	00:21:04	00:21:08	Hey, Grissom, can I see you for a sec? Stat.	N
306	306	306	00:21:09	00:21:11	Stay on the tire treads.	N
307	307	307	00:21:12	00:21:13	Warrick?	N
308	308	308	00:21:13	00:21:14	Yeah, right behind you.	N
309	309	309	00:21:33	00:21:36	A few more numbers and this could have been cake.	N
310	310	310	00:21:36	00:21:40	Guess who used to sign Brad Kendall's paychecks six years ago?	N
311	311	311	00:21:40	00:21:41	Frankie Flynn.	N
312	312	312	00:21:41	00:21:42	Oh, yeah.	N
313	313	313	00:21:44	00:21:45	Hey, Brad, thanks for coming in.	N
314	314	314	00:21:46	00:21:47	We've just got a few more questions.	N
315	315	315	00:21:47	00:21:49	Sure.	N
316	316	316	00:21:49	00:21:50	You used to work for Flynn?	N
317	317	317	00:21:50	00:21:52	At the Orpheus-- I was a waiter.	N
318	318	318	00:21:52	00:21:53	He came in all the time.	N
319	319	319	00:21:53	00:21:54	Sit down.	N
320	320	320	00:21:54	00:21:55	Sit down.	N
321	321	321	00:21:58	00:22:00	Did you see him outside the coffee shop?	N
322	322	322	00:22:00	00:22:02	Once in a while-- he owned the place.	N
323	323	323	00:22:02	00:22:03	He was everywhere.	N
324	324	324	00:22:03	00:22:06	Why don't you tell us about your CCW permit.	N
325	325	325	00:22:06	00:22:07	I made cash deposits.	N
326	326	326	00:22:08	00:22:09	I carry a concealed weapon.	N
327	327	327	00:22:09	00:22:10	What kind?	N
328	328	328	00:22:10	00:22:12	Glock, nine millimeter.	N
329	329	329	00:22:12	00:22:16	We'll need to see the weapon and any spare ammo.	N
330	330	330	00:22:16	00:22:17	Yeah, of course, I'll bring it in.	N
331	331	331	00:22:21	00:22:23	I am the man.	N
332	332	332	00:22:23	00:22:24	Why, what'd you do?	N
333	333	333	00:22:24	00:22:26	Let me guess.	N
334	334	334	00:22:26	00:22:28	You ran a DNA profile on the blood off his knuckles and you got a match.	N
335	335	335	00:22:28	00:22:30	No.	N
336	336	336	00:22:30	00:22:32	You ran a DNA profile and got something distinctive?	N
337	337	337	00:22:32	00:22:34	Not quite.	N
338	338	338	00:22:34	00:22:35	You got out of bed and dressed yourself?	N
339	339	339	00:22:35	00:22:37	No.	N
340	340	340	00:22:37	00:22:38	What is it, Greg?	N
341	341	341	00:22:41	00:22:42	Just put your nose down the scope.	N
342	342	342	00:22:46	00:22:49	Dots of blue light on a red sea.	N
343	343	343	00:22:49	00:22:50	Pyoverdin.	N
344	344	344	00:22:51	00:22:53	Pyoverdin.	N
345	345	345	00:22:53	00:23:00	A pigment excreted from pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a bacteria occasionally found in the bloodstream.	N
346	346	346	00:23:00	00:23:01	So what does that give us?	N
347	347	347	00:23:01	00:23:03	Your killer has fluorescent blue dots in his blood.	N
348	348	348	00:23:04	00:23:05	So the guy's a glow-stick.	N
349	349	349	00:23:05	00:23:06	How does that help us track him down?	N
350	350	350	00:23:06	00:23:07	Haven't I done enough for one day?	N
351	351	351	00:23:08	00:23:11	We have a lead-- I found a partial serial number on the broken taillight.	N
352	352	352	00:23:11	00:23:12	I saw it.	N
353	353	353	00:23:12	00:23:14	It's missing six digits, it's useless.	N
354	354	354	00:23:14	00:23:18	Maybe on its own but the tire tread database kicked out a match.	N
355	355	355	00:23:18	00:23:20	The tire belongs to a Ford Explorer.	N
356	356	356	00:23:20	00:23:24	A P235-75, manufactured specifically for their SUVs.	N
357	357	357	00:23:24	00:23:29	Only one with the same partial serial number is registered in Vegas.	N
358	358	358	00:23:29	00:23:35	What do you call a guy with blue dotted blood lice and keys to a Ford Explorer?	N
359	359	359	00:23:36	00:23:37	A suspect?	N
360	360	360	00:23:37	00:23:39	A killer.	N
361	361	361	00:23:49	00:23:52	You found the car that ran over Brian?	N
362	362	362	00:23:52	00:23:53	Yes.	N
363	363	363	00:23:53	00:23:57	The SUV's registered to Adam Walkey.	N
364	364	364	00:23:57	00:24:00	He's 18 years old; no prior complaints.	N
365	365	365	00:24:00	00:24:02	We're processing it now.	N
366	366	366	00:24:02	00:24:03	I promised to keep you informed.	N
367	367	367	00:24:04	00:24:05	You kept your word.	N
368	368	368	00:24:11	00:24:12	Lice?	N
369	369	369	00:24:12	00:24:15	Creepy critters in the passenger seat.	N
370	370	370	00:24:16	00:24:18	So... that's why Grissom's late.	N
371	371	371	00:24:18	00:24:20	You just don't like other women in his life.	N
372	372	372	00:24:20	00:24:23	I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.	N
373	373	373	00:24:24	00:24:27	Affirmative on the head lice.	N
374	374	374	00:24:28	00:24:29	Taillights match.	N
375	375	375	00:24:31	00:24:33	We have a suspect.	N
376	376	376	00:24:33	00:24:36	I'm advising Adam to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights.	N
377	377	377	00:24:36	00:24:40	No charges have been filed and I haven't asked a question.	N
378	378	378	00:24:40	00:24:41	Go ahead and ask...	N
379	379	379	00:24:41	00:24:42	he won't answer.	N
380	380	380	00:24:42	00:24:44	Well, that's why I suggested we meet here.	N
381	381	381	00:24:44	00:24:46	I don't need him to talk.	N
382	382	382	00:24:46	00:24:48	I just want his blood.	N
383	383	383	00:24:48	00:24:51	Well, for that, you're going to need a warrant.	N
384	384	384	00:24:58	00:25:00	This warrant is for blood...	N
385	385	385	00:25:01	00:25:03	and a scalp search.	N
386	386	386	00:25:03	00:25:06	It's a Licemeister.	N
387	387	387	00:25:08	00:25:10	We're going to comb your hair.	N
388	388	388	00:25:13	00:25:15	Talk to me.	N
389	389	389	00:25:15	00:25:17	Good news, bad news.	N
390	390	390	00:25:17	00:25:19	Same caliber, different gun.	N
391	391	391	00:25:20	00:25:22	Bobby?	N
392	392	392	00:25:22	00:25:23	Striations don't match.	N
393	393	393	00:25:24	00:25:30	The gun that killed those five people at the coffee house isn't your store manager's. The good news is-- all of the nine millimeter bullets fired at the scene...	N
394	394	394	00:25:30	00:25:32	from the same gun.	N
395	395	395	00:25:37	00:25:38	You're looking for only one guy.	N
396	396	396	00:25:38	00:25:41	Well, what about the breach-face marks on the casings?	N
397	397	397	00:25:41	00:25:42	Indeterminate.	N
398	398	398	00:25:42	00:25:43	Hmm.	N
399	399	399	00:25:46	00:25:50	Well, well... looks like you got zip.	N
400	400	400	00:25:50	00:25:54	I got a ton of people out interviewing every two-bit stiff that ever had a beef against Flynn.	N
401	401	401	00:25:54	00:25:56	They're all doing the smart thing-- keeping their mouth shut.	N
402	402	402	00:25:56	00:26:00	So have no statements or physical evidence indicating it was a hit on Flynn.	N
403	403	403	00:26:00	00:26:03	What we have is five dead bodies.	N
404	404	404	00:26:03	00:26:04	Yeah... why?	N
405	405	405	00:26:04	00:26:06	You know something I don't know?	N
406	406	406	00:26:06	00:26:08	Not yet.	N
407	407	407	00:26:10	00:26:12	Nick?	N
408	408	408	00:26:12	00:26:14	Smoke and mirrors.	N
409	409	409	00:26:17	00:26:24	If it was a hit, the guy came to the front door took out Al and Frankie, and got the witnesses.	N
410	410	410	00:26:24	00:26:26	Bullets will confirm it.	N
411	411	411	00:26:26	00:26:30	Shooter was standing here when he shot Al...	N
412	412	412	00:26:30	00:26:34	Bam. Once in the chest.	N
413	413	413	00:26:34	00:26:36	This is Flynn.	N
414	414	414	00:26:39	00:26:41	One miss...	N
415	415	415	00:26:44	00:26:46	one hit...	N
416	416	416	00:26:46	00:26:49	one through and through.	N
417	417	417	00:26:50	00:26:52	Headphones.	N
418	418	418	00:26:55	00:26:57	Ricochet.	N
419	419	419	00:27:02	00:27:03	Through and through.	N
420	420	420	00:27:27	00:27:29	Each victim gets a different color.	N
421	421	421	00:27:29	00:27:30	Blue beams are isolated.	N
422	422	422	00:27:30	00:27:33	The kid with the CD player was alone.	N
423	423	423	00:27:38	00:27:40	Flynn was closest to the door.	N
424	424	424	00:27:45	00:27:49	Shooter was positioned between Flynn and the front door.	N
425	425	425	00:27:49	00:27:50	Flynn eats it...	N
426	426	426	00:27:51	00:27:53	and I would have taken out Big Al...	N
427	427	427	00:27:53	00:27:54	bodyguard first.	N
428	428	428	00:27:54	00:27:55	Me, too.	N
429	429	429	00:27:55	00:28:00	Ident found both of the bodyguards' paws on the counter.	N
430	430	430	00:28:16	00:28:20	What if the shooter was here when he shot Big Al?	N
431	431	431	00:28:20	00:28:22	Big Al would already be dead.	N
432	432	432	00:28:22	00:28:23	It doesn't make any sense.	N
433	433	433	00:28:23	00:28:26	If the shooter walked through the front door.	N
434	434	434	00:28:26	00:28:29	What if he came through the back?	N
435	435	435	00:28:35	00:28:38	Erin McCarty-- the employee who was supposed to close up.	N
436	436	436	00:28:38	00:28:42	Yeah, shot twice in the back while heading for the rear exit.	N
437	437	437	00:29:00	00:29:07	If she was headed towards the parking lot how do you explain this ricochet?	N
438	438	438	00:29:07	00:29:08	What?	N
439	439	439	00:29:11	00:29:13	Whoa...	N
440	440	440	00:29:15	00:29:16	Like this.	N
441	441	441	00:30:14	00:30:16	I love this job.	N
442	442	442	00:30:16	00:30:20	The ricochet went out into the store.	N
443	443	443	00:30:20	00:30:23	There's no hole in the door.	N
444	444	444	00:30:25	00:30:29	There's no hole in the door 'cause the door had to have been open.	N
445	445	445	00:30:32	00:30:40	Assuming Erin was running for her life the shooter follows her in the back room shoots her twice-- he would have been shooting toward the parking lot.	N
446	446	446	00:30:40	00:30:42	He shot toward the parking lot first then toward the front of the store.	N
447	447	447	00:30:43	00:30:45	He'd only shoot toward the front if there's somebody there.	N
448	448	448	00:30:45	00:30:47	Someone was in the line of fire.	N
449	449	449	00:30:50	00:30:52	What if we have it backwards?	N
450	450	450	00:30:52	00:30:53	What if...	N
451	451	451	00:30:53	00:30:57	the shooting began back here... with Erin?	N
452	452	452	00:30:57	00:30:59	Yeah, and somebody else saw.	N
453	453	453	00:31:00	00:31:02	Frankie Flynn was an innocent bystander.	N
454	454	454	00:31:02	00:31:04	Wrong place, wrong time.	N
455	455	455	00:31:04	00:31:09	The target was Erin... the pregnant girl and the rest was damage control.	N
456	456	456	00:31:09	00:31:11	Adam Walkey doesn't have lice?	N
457	457	457	00:31:11	00:31:12	Not even lice eggs.	N
458	458	458	00:31:13	00:31:14	Maybe he got rid of them since the other night.	N
459	459	459	00:31:14	00:31:16	Delousing agents take time to kick in.	N
460	460	460	00:31:16	00:31:19	There would have been evidence of the infestation.	N
461	461	461	00:31:19	00:31:20	Hey... got good news.	N
462	462	462	00:31:20	00:31:22	Walkey's blood sample...	N
463	463	463	00:31:22	00:31:24	Pseudomonas aeruginosa?	N
464	464	464	00:31:24	00:31:25	Fluorescent blue.	N
465	465	465	00:31:26	00:31:29	Same as the blood we found on Brian's knuckle.	N
466	466	466	00:31:29	00:31:31	Greg, start a DNA comparison.	N
467	467	467	00:31:31	00:31:33	This gives us enough to hold Walkey.	N
468	468	468	00:31:33	00:31:36	It's just like Dr. Gilbert said...	N
469	469	469	00:31:36	00:31:38	the killer came from out here.	N
470	470	470	00:31:38	00:31:41	Dr. Gilbert can afford her personal bias.	N
471	471	471	00:31:41	00:31:42	We can't.	N
472	472	472	00:31:42	00:31:46	And we need a lot more than Day-Glo bacteria to get a conviction.	N
473	473	473	00:31:51	00:31:52	You really think Erin knew she was pregnant?	N
474	474	474	00:31:53	00:31:53	I mean, six weeks?	N
475	475	475	00:31:54	00:31:55	20-year-old girl, living at home?	N
476	476	476	00:31:55	00:31:59	She would have taken a test if she was five seconds late-- panic city.	N
477	477	477	00:31:59	00:32:01	Yeah, Brass talked to her parents.	N
478	478	478	00:32:01	00:32:02	There was no guy in her life.	N
479	479	479	00:32:02	00:32:04	Well, it's not immaculate conception.	N
480	480	480	00:32:04	00:32:07	If the guy was Mr. Right she would have told her folks.	N
481	481	481	00:32:07	00:32:09	Which means he was Mr. Wrong.	N
482	482	482	00:32:09	00:32:10	Maybe Mr. Married.	N
483	483	483	00:32:14	00:32:15	Back for more?	N
484	484	484	00:32:15	00:32:17	You still have the pregnant girl?	N
485	485	485	00:32:17	00:32:19	Mortuary will pick her up later this afternoon.	N
486	486	486	00:32:19	00:32:22	Stall them. We want a paternity test.	N
487	487	487	00:32:22	00:32:23	At six weeks?	N
488	488	488	00:32:23	00:32:27	Six weeks with half of someone else's DNA in her body.	N
489	489	489	00:32:48	00:32:49	Check this out.	N
490	490	490	00:32:57	00:32:59	This fabric matches the victim's sweater.	N
491	491	491	00:32:59	00:33:01	That's the muffler.	N
492	492	492	00:33:01	00:33:03	Now, this is the back of the car.	N
493	493	493	00:33:03	00:33:05	And the taillight was smashed.	N
494	494	494	00:33:05	00:33:09	There's no way this car was moving forward when it ran over Brian Clemonds's body.	N
495	495	495	00:33:09	00:33:12	Who drives backwards on a downtown street?	N
496	496	496	00:33:13	00:33:15	First degree murder.	N
497	497	497	00:33:15	00:33:17	That's how we see it.	N
498	498	498	00:33:18	00:33:19	It's okay.	N
499	499	499	00:33:19	00:33:24	In that case, my client is now prepared to make a statement.	N
500	500	500	00:33:24	00:33:26	Tell him, Adam.	N
501	501	501	00:33:26	00:33:28	I may have hit the guy.	N
502	502	502	00:33:28	00:33:30	That's some statement.	N
503	503	503	00:33:30	00:33:32	Okay. I remember hitting something.	N
504	504	504	00:33:32	00:33:34	It was dark.	N
505	505	505	00:33:34	00:33:36	I-I just kept driving.	N
506	506	506	00:33:36	00:33:38	Didn't look back.	N
507	507	507	00:33:38	00:33:39	Adam...	N
508	508	508	00:33:41	00:33:46	We found lice in the driver's seat of your vehicle but your scalp was clean.	N
509	509	509	00:33:48	00:33:50	Was there anyone else there?	N
510	510	510	00:33:50	00:33:54	A witness who might support your account?	N
511	511	511	00:33:59	00:34:02	Yeah, someone was with me.	N
512	512	512	00:34:02	00:34:04	Mark.	N
513	513	513	00:34:04	00:34:05	Mark Rucker.	N
514	514	514	00:34:05	00:34:08	He can confirm everything I told you.	N
515	515	515	00:34:08	00:34:09	I want to see him.	N
516	516	516	00:34:09	00:34:11	That's the coward who killed Brian.	N
517	517	517	00:34:11	00:34:13	What happened?	N
518	518	518	00:34:13	00:34:14	He scared you?	N
519	519	519	00:34:14	00:34:15	Talked a little funny?	N
520	520	520	00:34:15	00:34:17	Made a lot of noises? Screamed?	N
521	521	521	00:34:17	00:34:20	Or maybe he just looked at you the wrong way?	N
522	522	522	00:34:20	00:34:22	Get away from me.	N
523	523	523	00:34:25	00:34:27	You make me sick.	N
524	524	524	00:34:36	00:34:38	You said you'd include me.	N
525	525	525	00:34:38	00:34:42	You offered to help to help with my investigation and now you're compromising it.	N
526	526	526	00:34:42	00:34:44	You found the killer.	N
527	527	527	00:34:44	00:34:46	Who says it was a hit and run not murder.	N
528	528	528	00:34:46	00:34:47	He has a witness.	N
529	529	529	00:34:47	00:34:48	Who will lie for him.	N
530	530	530	00:34:48	00:34:50	The witness can say whatever he wants.	N
531	531	531	00:34:50	00:34:55	The important thing is that Adam Walkey was not alone when he killed Brian.	N
532	532	532	00:34:55	00:34:58	Until now, I did not know who was with him.	N
533	533	533	00:34:58	00:35:00	And now you do.	N
534	534	534	00:35:00	00:35:05	His witness is our other suspect.	N
535	535	535	00:35:05	00:35:07	911 page?	N
536	536	536	00:35:07	00:35:08	What's up?	N
537	537	537	00:35:08	00:35:10	Right gun. Wrong barrel.	N
538	538	538	00:35:10	00:35:12	Son of a bitch swapped the gun barrel out.	N
539	539	539	00:35:12	00:35:14	Check this out.	N
540	540	540	00:35:16	00:35:18	Could be an incomplete tool mark.	N
541	541	541	00:35:18	00:35:20	Maybe the guy dropped his gun.	N
542	542	542	00:35:20	00:35:23	Either way, we still don't have the barrel.	N
543	543	543	00:35:23	00:35:24	This is true. But we've got Kendall's ammo.	N
544	544	544	00:35:25	00:35:26	What about bullet batching?	N
545	545	545	00:35:26	00:35:27	Match the bunter marks?	N
546	546	546	00:35:30	00:35:31	manufacturer and caliber.	N
547	547	547	00:35:31	00:35:33	Etched in by an electrodischarge machine.	N
548	548	548	00:35:35	00:35:38	Every casing from a given batch of ammo has the same markings.	N
549	549	549	00:35:38	00:35:43	So if you compared the casings we collected at the crime scene with the casings from Brad Kendall's gun...	N
550	550	550	00:35:43	00:35:46	On a microscopic level, we should find similar characteristics...	N
551	551	551	00:35:46	00:35:49	Which would link Brad's ammo to the crime even though we can't link his gun.	N
552	552	552	00:35:49	00:35:50	Not as airtight as matching the barrel.	N
553	553	553	00:35:51	00:35:52	But still enough to build a case.	N
554	554	554	00:35:52	00:35:53	What about motive?	N
555	555	555	00:35:53	00:35:56	Well, Catherine's working on a hunch.	N
556	556	556	00:35:56	00:35:57	Me? The father?	N
557	557	557	00:35:57	00:35:58	No way. I'm married.	N
558	558	558	00:35:58	00:35:59	I don't fool around.	N
559	559	559	00:36:00	00:36:03	Would you like us to explain the mechanics of sex in the workplace?	N
560	560	560	00:36:03	00:36:04	You're the manager.	N
561	561	561	00:36:04	00:36:05	Erin was the employee.	N
562	562	562	00:36:05	00:36:07	You had the power.	N
563	563	563	00:36:07	00:36:08	Happens all the time.	N
564	564	564	00:36:08	00:36:09	You got it all wrong.	N
565	565	565	00:36:10	00:36:15	Maybe we do; we all make mistakes, but just to be sure why don't you give us a DNA sample and you'll be on your way.	N
566	566	566	00:36:15	00:36:16	I don't believe this.	N
567	567	567	00:36:16	00:36:17	Talk to anyone.	N
568	568	568	00:36:17	00:36:19	I'm not like that.	N
569	569	569	00:36:19	00:36:21	I've got a court order.	N
570	570	570	00:36:27	00:36:29	It was a one-time thing.	N
571	571	571	00:36:29	00:36:31	I didn't even know she was pregnant.	N
572	572	572	00:36:33	00:36:36	I read him his rights.	N
573	573	573	00:36:36	00:36:38	Last chance for a lawyer.	N
574	574	574	00:36:38	00:36:39	I didn't do anything.	N
575	575	575	00:36:40	00:36:41	Why would I need a lawyer?	N
576	576	576	00:36:41	00:36:44	Fire away.	N
577	577	577	00:36:46	00:36:48	Does your head itch?	N
578	578	578	00:36:48	00:36:50	Do I have to answer that?	N
579	579	579	00:36:52	00:36:55	I'm going to just, uh...	N
580	580	580	00:36:55	00:36:58	rearrange your part a little.	N
581	581	581	00:37:07	00:37:08	Hmm.	N
582	582	582	00:37:09	00:37:18	According to Adam Walkey you were with him in his SUV the other night and your head lice... confirmed his statement.	N
583	583	583	00:37:18	00:37:20	They also tell me that you were driving.	N
584	584	584	00:37:20	00:37:22	Yeah, yeah, I was with him.	N
585	585	585	00:37:22	00:37:25	And like he told you, we didn't know he hit the guy.	N
586	586	586	00:37:25	00:37:27	How do you know what Adam told us?	N
587	587	587	00:37:33	00:37:37	Now, why don't you just tell us what really happened.	N
588	588	588	00:37:37	00:37:40	Well, it was around midnight...	N
589	589	589	00:37:40	00:37:43	and we were listening to the radio.	N
590	590	590	00:37:43	00:37:44	I changed the station.	N
591	591	591	00:37:44	00:37:45	Adam got pissed.	N
592	592	592	00:37:45	00:37:47	Dude, what are you doing?	N
593	593	593	00:37:47	00:37:48	That song is a classic.	N
594	594	594	00:37:48	00:37:50	It's not a classic. It's crap.	N
595	595	595	00:37:50	00:37:51	It's always been crap.	N
596	596	596	00:37:51	00:37:54	Now, this... this is tight.	N
597	597	597	00:37:55	00:37:57	Wh-what was that?	N
598	598	598	00:37:57	00:37:58	Probably a dog.	N
599	599	599	00:37:58	00:38:00	Let's get out of here.	N
600	600	600	00:38:00	00:38:01	We just kept driving.	N
601	601	601	00:38:03	00:38:05	Yeah, it's the truth.	N
602	602	602	00:38:05	00:38:08	The evidence says otherwise.	N
603	603	603	00:38:09	00:38:12	What are you talking about?	N
604	604	604	00:38:12	00:38:14	Well, there weren't just lice in the SUV.	N
605	605	605	00:38:14	00:38:17	There were lice on the victim's sweater.	N
606	606	606	00:38:18	00:38:20	So, who cares about lice?	N
607	607	607	00:38:20	00:38:23	Do you know what lice eat?	N
608	608	608	00:38:25	00:38:26	Blood.	N
609	609	609	00:38:26	00:38:33	I'm pretty sure I can prove that the lice on Brian Clemonds came from your head.	N
610	610	610	00:38:37	00:38:39	We got out of the car.	N
611	611	611	00:38:47	00:38:49	We got to call the paramedics.	N
612	612	612	00:38:49	00:38:52	We tell anybody, we are in trouble.	N
613	613	613	00:38:52	00:38:54	We can go to jail.	N
614	614	614	00:38:55	00:38:57	But I didn't want to leave him like that.	N
615	615	615	00:38:57	00:38:59	Adam talked me into it.	N
616	616	616	00:38:59	00:39:02	He had a scholarship to Duke next year, you know.	N
617	617	617	00:39:02	00:39:03	He couldn't risk it.	N
618	618	618	00:39:05	00:39:07	Let me tell you what I think happened.	N
619	619	619	00:39:07	00:39:13	You and Adam saw Brian walking out of a liquor store carrying a six-pack.	N
620	620	620	00:39:13	00:39:14	You're underage.	N
621	621	621	00:39:14	00:39:16	Maybe you wanted him to front you some beer.	N
622	622	622	00:39:16	00:39:18	Hey, man, can you do us a favor?	N
623	623	623	00:39:18	00:39:20	Brian doesn't respond.	N
624	624	624	00:39:22	00:39:23	What's his problem?	N
625	625	625	00:39:23	00:39:24	Let's find out.	N
626	626	626	00:39:27	00:39:28	Then you got out of the car.	N
627	627	627	00:39:29	00:39:31	Hey, moron, we just want you to buy us some beer.	N
628	628	628	00:39:31	00:39:32	How about we just grab yours, huh?	N
629	629	629	00:39:32	00:39:34	What do you want? What do you say?	N
630	630	630	00:39:34	00:39:35	You going to give it up?	N
631	631	631	00:39:35	00:39:37	Brian still doesn't say anything.	N
632	632	632	00:39:37	00:39:38	So you keep pushing.	N
633	633	633	00:39:38	00:39:39	Go away!	N
634	634	634	00:39:43	00:39:44	Give...	N
635	635	635	00:39:46	00:39:47	Bring him down!	N
636	636	636	00:39:52	00:39:56	The blood on the victim's knuckles led us to Adam.	N
637	637	637	00:39:56	00:40:00	The average male loses 80 hairs a day.	N
638	638	638	00:40:00	00:40:05	Stray hair left behind lice, which brings us to you.	N
639	639	639	00:40:10	00:40:16	It would have ended there, but as you were about to drive away something caught your attention.	N
640	640	640	00:40:16	00:40:19	Something in the rearview mirror.	N
641	641	641	00:40:23	00:40:24	Please don't hit me!	N
642	642	642	00:40:24	00:40:26	Please don't!	N
643	643	643	00:40:35	00:40:36	You backed the car up.	N
644	644	644	00:40:40	00:40:42	And you took off.	N
645	645	645	00:40:42	00:40:44	I want a lawyer.	N
646	646	646	00:40:44	00:40:47	Let me tell you something, son.	N
647	647	647	00:40:47	00:40:48	Gil, the interrogation is over.	N
648	648	648	00:40:48	00:40:50	He's requested counsel.	N
649	649	649	00:40:52	00:40:54	Fine.	N
650	650	650	00:40:54	00:40:56	No more questions.	N
651	651	651	00:40:56	00:40:57	Just this.	N
652	652	652	00:40:57	00:41:01	You want to know why Brian Clemonds ran away from you?	N
653	653	653	00:41:03	00:41:09	It was dark; you were shouting at him; and he didn't understand what you were saying.	N
654	654	654	00:41:09	00:41:12	Brian Clemonds was deaf.	N
655	655	655	00:41:15	00:41:18	He was afraid of you.	N
656	656	656	00:41:21	00:41:24	But you were more afraid of him... weren't you?	N
657	657	657	00:41:43	00:41:45	What am I looking at?	N
658	658	658	00:41:45	00:41:47	Microscopic surface analysis.	N
659	659	659	00:41:49	00:41:51	This ought to make things more clear.	N
660	660	660	00:41:55	00:41:57	A bunter tool leaves a unique mark.	N
661	661	661	00:42:01	00:42:03	Casings from your gun are on the right.	N
662	662	662	00:42:03	00:42:07	Casings collected from the crime scene are on the left.	N
663	663	663	00:42:07	00:42:09	They're identical.	N
664	664	664	00:42:09	00:42:11	You came here that night...	N
665	665	665	00:42:11	00:42:13	to kill Erin.	N
666	666	666	00:42:13	00:42:15	You came in through the back.	N
667	667	667	00:42:15	00:42:16	Erin was in the office.	N
668	668	668	00:42:16	00:42:18	We got to talk. I'm tired of talking to you.	N
669	669	669	00:42:18	00:42:20	Listen to me! I'm tired of listening to you.	N
670	670	670	00:42:20	00:42:21	I will take care of this.	N
671	671	671	00:42:21	00:42:22	All you take care of is yourself.	N
672	672	672	00:42:22	00:42:24	Erin, think. Use your head for once.	N
673	673	673	00:42:24	00:42:26	I'm not going to let you ruin my life!	N
674	674	674	00:42:26	00:42:27	I already have thought about it.	N
675	675	675	00:42:27	00:42:30	I'm going to have this baby and you are going to support it.	N
676	676	676	00:42:30	00:42:33	I'll let you know if it's a boy or a girl.	N
677	677	677	00:42:36	00:42:37	But Alice saw.	N
678	678	678	00:42:37	00:42:38	You shot her.	N
679	679	679	00:42:39	00:42:46	You thought that Alice had locked up but there was a kid drinking coffee and then things got out of hand.	N
680	680	680	00:42:56	00:42:59	And you just kept on shooting.	N
681	681	681	00:43:03	00:43:15	Brad Kendall, you're under arrest for the murders of Frankie Flynn Al Robson, Roy Hinton, Alice Neely and Erin McCarty.	N
682	682	682	00:43:15	00:43:18	Six weeks pregnant with your child.	N
683	683	683	00:43:22	00:43:25	I didn't mean for it to happen like that.	N
684	684	684	00:43:25	00:43:27	I just wanted to talk.	N
685	685	685	00:43:27	00:43:29	Is that why you brought your gun?	N
686	686	686	00:43:35	00:43:37	Some people are just afraid.	N
687	687	687	00:43:37	00:43:40	And that's why they killed Brian.	N
688	688	688	00:43:40	00:43:42	Because he was different.	N
689	689	689	00:43:43	00:43:45	You don't see us as different.	N
690	690	690	00:43:46	00:43:47	You're not.	N
691	691	691	00:43:47	00:43:49	Who taught you to sign?	N
692	692	692	00:43:51	00:43:52	My mother.	N
693	693	693	00:43:53	00:43:54	Tell me about her.	N
694	694	694	00:43:54	00:43:55	And use your hands.	N
695	695	695	00:43:55	00:43:57	You're a little rusty.	N
