0	00:00:29	00:00:36	You can breathalyze me all you want, but the broad came right at me, I swear.	N
1	00:00:36	00:00:38	It wasn't my fault.	N
2	00:00:38	00:00:44	Ooh, that's what happens when 6,000 pounds of thrust meets three feet of hood.	N
3	00:00:44	00:00:46	This was not a fair fight.	N
4	00:00:55	00:00:58	Well, now, how did she end up way over here?	N
5	00:00:58	00:01:02	There must be 20 feet of rubber burned into this asphalt.	N
6	00:01:02	00:01:05	She was braking hard.	N
7	00:01:05	00:01:07	She definitely swerved out of her lane.	N
8	00:01:09	00:01:13	I think I may know why.	N
9	00:01:19	00:01:21	What kind of animal are we talking about here?	N
10	00:01:21	00:01:23	A big one.	N
11	00:01:24	00:01:27	The victim could have clipped the animal when it ran in front of her.	N
12	00:01:29	00:01:31	Well, it can't have gone far.	N
13	00:02:50	00:02:53	Hmm. Ooh. Not much padding.	N
14	00:02:53	00:02:54	Whoa.	N
15	00:02:54	00:02:56	This is incredibly detailed.	N
16	00:02:56	00:02:59	Eyelashes, nostrils...	N
17	00:02:59	00:03:01	Oh, yeah.	N
18	00:03:01	00:03:02	That's what you see out of.	N
19	00:03:02	00:03:06	I once dated the Detroit Lions mascot. Off-season.	N
20	00:03:06	00:03:09	Dutch was his name.	N
21	00:03:09	00:03:12	The breadth of your social experience never ceases to impress me.	N
22	00:03:16	00:03:19	Dutch never had furballs, though.	N
23	00:03:29	00:03:31	Are you all right, David?	N
24	00:03:31	00:03:34	It's just... disturbing.	N
25	00:03:34	00:03:39	There was a big raccoon who hosted an after-school kids show when I was little.	N
26	00:03:39	00:03:41	Stripey.	N
27	00:03:41	00:03:42	Everybody loved him.	N
28	00:03:42	00:03:45	I loved him.	N
29	00:03:45	00:03:51	Stripey's brother suffered blunt force trauma caused by a violent collision with a moving vehicle.	N
30	00:04:02	00:04:08	The eternal question-- why did the man in the raccoon suit cross the road?	N
31	00:04:18	00:04:20	Frozen stiff.	N
32	00:04:20	00:04:24	Looks like he died trying to get out.	N
33	00:04:24	00:04:27	Trying to get to the door, maybe.	N
34	00:04:27	00:04:30	It got messy.	N
35	00:04:30	00:04:32	Check out the shotgun spatter.	N
36	00:04:32	00:04:34	Single blast.	N
37	00:04:34	00:04:36	Went in, went out.	N
38	00:04:36	00:04:40	Ooh. This has got to be the coldest place in Vegas.	N
39	00:04:40	00:04:42	Let's go. Vega's got the security guard.	N
40	00:04:42	00:04:44	Yeah, he's not going anywhere.	N
41	00:04:51	00:04:53	So, Peter, when you checked in...	N
42	00:04:53	00:04:54	Not Peter.	N
43	00:04:54	00:04:56	Petey. P-E-T-E-Y.	N
44	00:04:56	00:04:57	Hey, how you doing? Good.	N
45	00:04:57	00:05:00	The shooter may have cleaned out the machines.	Y
46	00:05:00	00:05:01	Those things hold a lot of dough.	N
47	00:05:01	00:05:02	Take was maybe, uh, $600.	N
48	00:05:02	00:05:04	They shot a guy over a vending machine?	Y
49	00:05:04	00:05:08	So, uh, Petey, where were you when all this went down?	N
50	00:05:08	00:05:09	I was in the guard shack.	N
51	00:05:09	00:05:10	Where else would I be?	N
52	00:05:10	00:05:11	You tell us.	N
53	00:05:11	00:05:16	If a guy walks into a freezer, shoots a guy and smashes six vending machines, I think I'd hear that.	N
54	00:05:16	00:05:18	The shack's out there.	N
55	00:05:18	00:05:20	You don't make rounds?	N
56	00:05:20	00:05:22	Look, I'm not supposed to leave the premises, okay?	N
57	00:05:22	00:05:25	Okay, but if you were here, you're a suspect.	N
58	00:05:25	00:05:28	Come on, man.	N
59	00:05:28	00:05:30	Middle of the shift, you're getting hungry.	N
60	00:05:30	00:05:33	You figure, Hey, I'll duck out, grab a bite to eat.	N
61	00:05:33	00:05:34	Who's going to know, right?	N
62	00:05:35	00:05:36	I was gone five minutes, tops.	N
63	00:05:36	00:05:38	When?	N
64	00:05:38	00:05:39	00.	N
65	00:05:39	00:05:40	Grabbed a burger and came back.	N
66	00:05:40	00:05:41	What kind of burger?	N
67	00:05:41	00:05:42	In 'N' Out-- three blocks from here.	N
68	00:05:42	00:05:45	I always get the In 'N' Out Double-Double, Animal Style.	N
69	00:05:45	00:05:46	That's what I get.	N
70	00:05:46	00:05:47	You grill the onions?	N
71	00:05:47	00:05:48	Hell, yeah.	N
72	00:05:48	00:05:54	Now, that is crazy, Petey, 'cause you know, being an In 'N' Out kind of guy, I know it takes at least five minutes to grill the onions alone.	N
73	00:05:54	00:05:56	Come on, man.	N
74	00:05:56	00:06:01	That time of night, you're lucky if you don't wait 20 minutes just to get to the window.	N
75	00:06:04	00:06:08	Look, my boss finds out I'm leaving the site every night to get my burger on, I'm toast.	N
76	00:06:08	00:06:11	You keep lying to us, you're going to be toast in a jumpsuit.	N
77	00:06:13	00:06:19	00, this cat George-- he usually works days-- drives up and asks me where Al is.	N
78	00:06:19	00:06:21	Al Sesto? The guy in the freezer?	N
79	00:06:21	00:06:23	I told him he was back here.	N
80	00:06:23	00:06:24	I came back. Everything was quiet.	N
81	00:06:24	00:06:26	So I ate my dinner in my shack.	N
82	00:06:26	00:06:27	Where'd George go?	N
83	00:06:27	00:06:30	Beats me. His car's still in the parking lot.	N
84	00:06:30	00:06:31	Want to show me which one?	N
85	00:06:31	00:06:34	Sure.	N
86	00:06:34	00:06:41	Unless he was slick, the guy that did this definitely left behind a print, and, frankly, nothing about this looks slick.	Y
87	00:06:42	00:06:43	Linda Jones, 35, single.	N
88	00:06:43	00:06:46	We're trying to track down the next-of-kin.	N
89	00:06:46	00:06:49	No mystery in cause of death, though.	N
90	00:06:49	00:06:50	Your basic massive internal trauma.	N
91	00:06:50	00:06:51	And then some.	N
92	00:06:52	00:06:54	Anything unusual about our furry friend?	N
93	00:06:54	00:06:56	We're about to find out.	N
94	00:07:08	00:07:11	Did you know that raccoons have opposable thumbs?	N
95	00:07:11	00:07:14	Well, this one liked to wrap his around a bottle.	N
96	00:07:14	00:07:16	One Day at a Time.	N
97	00:07:16	00:07:18	He was a friend of Bill W.'s.	N
98	00:07:19	00:07:22	I'll send the blood work down to Tox.	N
99	00:07:22	00:07:26	Oh, my-- hand stitching.	N
100	00:07:26	00:07:28	Lining looks like some kind of latex.	N
101	00:07:36	00:07:40	Whoa. That's a lot of blood for blunt force trauma.	N
102	00:07:41	00:07:42	This isn't a costume.	N
103	00:07:42	00:07:44	It's a six-foot condom.	N
104	00:07:44	00:07:46	Explains why there was no blood on the road.	N
105	00:07:48	00:07:51	Yeah, his tailor didn't think of everything.	N
106	00:07:51	00:07:53	His suit's not bulletproof.	N
107	00:07:54	00:07:55	Shall we?	N
108	00:08:04	00:08:05	Through and through.	N
109	00:08:05	00:08:07	It's a high-velocity round.	N
110	00:08:07	00:08:09	Gives the bullet a smooth entry in and out.	N
111	00:08:09	00:08:12	So, he was shot and hit by a car.	N
112	00:08:12	00:08:13	Bad night.	N
113	00:08:13	00:08:15	Even for a raccoon.	N
114	00:08:15	00:08:20	The last time this happened they tried to chop the guy out.	N
115	00:08:20	00:08:22	1989-- year the Mirage opened.	N
116	00:08:22	00:08:24	How'd it go?	N
117	00:08:24	00:08:26	Lost an arm and a leg.	N
118	00:08:27	00:08:29	I miss the cold weather.	N
119	00:08:29	00:08:32	So, what are we going to use, hot water?	N
120	00:08:32	00:08:33	Boiling works best.	N
121	00:08:33	00:08:36	Just, uh, spread it around the perimeter.	N
122	00:08:36	00:08:37	Melt the ice.	N
123	00:08:37	00:08:39	Guys, let's do it here.	N
124	00:08:41	00:08:42	To preserve the body?	N
125	00:08:42	00:08:43	That's right.	N
126	00:08:43	00:08:47	Close as you can.	N
127	00:09:01	00:09:03	All right, guys, let's go.	N
128	00:10:18	00:10:20	Hi, Warrick. Hey.	N
129	00:10:20	00:10:22	Anything on Mr. Raccoon?	N
130	00:10:22	00:10:23	Yeah.	N
131	00:10:23	00:10:25	I got an AFIS hit.	N
132	00:10:25	00:10:27	Robert Pitt.	N
133	00:10:27	00:10:29	Court-ordered to AA after a DUI.	N
134	00:10:29	00:10:32	Oh, that explains the 30-day chip.	N
135	00:10:32	00:10:36	Maybe he fell off the wagon after he hit 31.	N
136	00:10:36	00:10:40	If I had to walk around dressed like Rocky Raccoon, I'd be drinking, too.	N
137	00:10:40	00:10:42	I don't get this whole thing.	N
138	00:10:42	00:10:43	Oh, hey, Warrick, it's Vegas.	N
139	00:10:43	00:10:45	People come here to be animals.	N
140	00:10:45	00:10:46	I hear you.	N
141	00:10:46	00:10:47	Take a look at this.	N
142	00:10:48	00:10:51	Oh, yes, the blue fur in the vomit.	N
143	00:10:52	00:10:53	Yeah, it's synthetic, not natural.	N
144	00:10:53	00:10:56	Your manimal died sober.	N
145	00:10:56	00:10:58	No alcohol.	N
146	00:10:58	00:10:59	Really?	N
147	00:10:59	00:11:07	All this schmohawk had in his system was trace amounts of ipecac and civet oil, which, if you ask me, is even weirder than the raccoon suit he was wearing.	N
148	00:11:07	00:11:09	Well, ipecac's an emetic.	N
149	00:11:09	00:11:14	I once gave it to Lindsey when she swallowed mothballs, but civet oil?	N
150	00:11:14	00:11:15	Yeah. Civet's a wild cat.	N
151	00:11:15	00:11:20	Its scent has been prized since the pharaohs for being an aphrodisiac.	N
152	00:11:31	00:11:33	Pitt was a computer programmer.	N
153	00:11:33	00:11:34	No next-of-kin.	N
154	00:11:34	00:11:35	Ooh.	N
155	00:11:35	00:11:38	Not an Architectural Digestreader.	N
156	00:11:45	00:11:50	If you want to know what the man really is all about, check out his bedroom.	N
157	00:11:57	00:11:59	Now, this scares me.	N
158	00:11:59	00:12:00	A man lives alone.	N
159	00:12:01	00:12:02	Has no relatives.	N
160	00:12:02	00:12:04	No attachments.	N
161	00:12:04	00:12:10	So, he forms his own furry little family.	N
162	00:12:15	00:12:17	PAF Con meeting.	N
163	00:12:17	00:12:18	What's PAF Con?	N
164	00:12:18	00:12:23	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's still going on.	N
165	00:12:23	00:12:26	Minus one raccoon.	N
166	00:12:34	00:12:36	PAF Con?	N
167	00:12:37	00:12:39	The Plushies and Furries Convention.	N
168	00:12:39	00:12:42	And we're looking for a bright blue plushy, I think.	N
169	00:12:49	00:12:51	This is fascinating.	N
170	00:12:51	00:12:53	A whole tribe of people...	N
171	00:12:53	00:12:58	...who prefer to interact as furry animals rather than human beings.	N
172	00:12:58	00:13:02	I think I'm having Hunter Thompson's flashbacks.	N
173	00:13:02	00:13:05	This is weirding me out.	N
174	00:13:05	00:13:06	It's not that weird.	N
175	00:13:06	00:13:07	It's instinctual.	N
176	00:13:08	00:13:14	Many Native American tribes wore entire bearskins, including the bead, when they performed their war dances.	N
177	00:13:14	00:13:16	They thought it made them brave.	N
178	00:13:16	00:13:18	I'm not getting the brave thing.	N
179	00:13:18	00:13:22	Well, think of stuffed animals as a Jungian archetype.	N
180	00:13:22	00:13:25	What's the one quality they possess that a man like Bob Pitt might want?	N
181	00:13:25	00:13:27	A full head of hair?	N
182	00:13:27	00:13:30	They're lovable.	N
183	00:13:30	00:13:33	We better divide and mingle.	N
184	00:13:34	00:13:38	I'm going to take in a lecture.	N
185	00:13:40	00:13:41	Uh, why did you page us?	N
186	00:13:41	00:13:42	Your wood sample from the freezer.	N
187	00:13:42	00:13:43	The one we gave Hodges?	N
188	00:13:43	00:13:45	Yeah. He bounced it back to me.	N
189	00:13:45	00:13:46	I'm lost.	N
190	00:13:46	00:13:47	It's from a shotgun stock.	N
191	00:13:47	00:13:48	Probably a Mossberg 500.	N
192	00:13:48	00:13:50	Probably our murder weapon.	N
193	00:13:50	00:13:52	Well, if you find it, I can match it.	N
194	00:13:52	00:13:53	Till we do, anything else?	N
195	00:13:53	00:13:55	That's up to Hodges.	N
196	00:13:55	00:13:58	The gray stuff-- it's adhesive.	N
197	00:13:58	00:13:59	On the gun stock?	N
198	00:13:59	00:14:01	Cheap repair.	N
199	00:14:02	00:14:07	So, some budget-minded garage gunsmith glues his gun stock together...	N
200	00:14:07	00:14:10	And then kills Al Sesto for $600 in change.	N
201	00:14:10	00:14:12	Even Petey can do better than that.	N
202	00:14:12	00:14:14	There's always the elusive George.	N
203	00:14:24	00:14:26	Can I help you, sir?	N
204	00:14:26	00:14:28	Yeah, I want to report a crime.	N
205	00:14:31	00:14:35	Let's start with what you were doing at Big &amp; Best Warehouse, George.	N
206	00:14:35	00:14:36	You're the day guy.	N
207	00:14:36	00:14:38	It was the night shift there.	N
208	00:14:38	00:14:40	Expired ice cream.	N
209	00:14:40	00:14:41	Trash for cash.	N
210	00:14:41	00:14:43	You're selling expired ice cream?	N
211	00:14:43	00:14:44	It's still good.	N
212	00:14:44	00:14:45	Oh.	N
213	00:14:45	00:14:47	Go on, please.	N
214	00:14:47	00:14:51	I wanted to give Al his piece of the action, 88 bucks.	N
215	00:14:51	00:14:55	We, uh, walked into the break room, and someone was smashing up the candy machine.	N
216	00:14:58	00:14:59	Ski mask?	N
217	00:14:59	00:15:00	Yeah.	N
218	00:15:00	00:15:02	And he had a gun.	Y
219	00:15:04	00:15:04	Better chill, bro. Okay.	Y
220	00:15:05	00:15:06	Get back. Don't shoot!	N
221	00:15:06	00:15:07	Shut up! Don't shoot.	N
222	00:15:09	00:15:11	He shot Al.	Y
223	00:15:11	00:15:14	Then the guy hauls off and brains me.	Y
224	00:15:14	00:15:17	And after that, everything went black.	N
225	00:15:17	00:15:19	Everything went black?	N
226	00:15:19	00:15:22	That's a pretty nasty bruise.	N
227	00:15:22	00:15:23	Yeah, I told you.	N
228	00:15:23	00:15:25	So, you blacked out.	N
229	00:15:25	00:15:26	Then what happened?	N
230	00:15:26	00:15:33	I was blindfolded, shoved into the trunk of some car and, uh, drove around for almost an hour.	N
231	00:15:33	00:15:35	It, uh, glows in the dark.	N
232	00:15:35	00:15:36	Oh, yeah.	N
233	00:15:37	00:15:41	So, uh, now, how did you get out?	N
234	00:15:41	00:15:42	Tire iron.	N
235	00:15:42	00:15:45	I felt around in the dark, and, uh, there it was.	N
236	00:15:45	00:15:46	Where?	N
237	00:15:46	00:15:48	Under the, uh, the trunk liner.	N
238	00:15:48	00:15:50	I had to really twist to get at it.	N
239	00:15:50	00:15:51	Which hand did you use?	N
240	00:15:51	00:15:53	Right.	N
241	00:15:53	00:15:55	And then what?	N
242	00:15:55	00:15:56	I popped the trunk.	N
243	00:16:02	00:16:04	I-I was in Pahrump.	N
244	00:16:04	00:16:07	I got family out there, but nobody was home.	N
245	00:16:07	00:16:09	All right, MacGyver, could you do me a favor?	N
246	00:16:09	00:16:11	Could you stand up and hold your arms out?	N
247	00:16:11	00:16:13	I'm just going to check you out here.	N
248	00:16:24	00:16:25	I'm ticklish.	N
249	00:16:25	00:16:27	Oh.	N
250	00:16:35	00:16:38	George...	N
251	00:16:38	00:16:43	I'm afraid you and your pants are going to be here for a while.	N
252	00:16:44	00:17:13	In The Eight Ages of Man, Erikson states that the child often indulges in fantasies of being a tiger, but in his dream, runs in terror for dear life, thus leaving the child forever divided in himself, as his true potential is squashed by the observing superego of society.	N
253	00:17:14	00:17:17	Birth is-is not destiny.	N
254	00:17:17	00:17:22	And a human form doesn't always come with a human spirit.	N
255	00:17:22	00:17:29	We gather here to embrace our inner animal, and to bring our true nature to bear.	N
256	00:17:29	00:17:31	So to speak.	N
257	00:17:32	00:17:34	Five-minute break.	N
258	00:17:36	00:17:41	Excuse me. Do you recognize this man, Robert Pitt?	N
259	00:17:43	00:17:45	Oh.	N
260	00:17:45	00:17:46	Hello, guys.	N
261	00:17:46	00:17:47	Pardon me.	N
262	00:17:47	00:17:49	Uh, can you help me out here?	N
263	00:17:49	00:17:52	Do you recognize this guy?	N
264	00:17:52	00:17:54	Look-look again.	N
265	00:17:54	00:17:55	Uh-uh.	N
266	00:17:55	00:17:56	Hmm.	N
267	00:17:56	00:17:58	Nice dog.	N
268	00:18:21	00:18:23	There you go.	N
269	00:18:53	00:18:55	I'm Catherine Willows.	N
270	00:18:55	00:18:57	I'm with the Crime Lab.	N
271	00:19:10	00:19:14	I guess we're lucky that blue's not a more popular color. Wait.	N
272	00:19:14	00:19:16	This is racial profiling.	N
273	00:19:16	00:19:22	Um, we're going to need samples of your fur.	N
274	00:19:22	00:19:25	We're also going to need to talk to you without the masks on.	N
275	00:19:28	00:19:30	Uh-uh.	N
276	00:19:30	00:19:32	You have a problem with that?	N
277	00:19:32	00:19:35	You wouldn't ask a human lady to take her makeup off.	N
278	00:19:35	00:19:40	If you want to talk to me, this is the me you're going to talk to.	N
279	00:20:03	00:20:05	Take this chair right here.	N
280	00:20:08	00:20:11	Do you a have a name, Miss, uh...?	N
281	00:20:11	00:20:12	My friends call me Sexy.	N
282	00:20:12	00:20:14	Oh, lucky you.	N
283	00:20:14	00:20:16	Now, do you want some help with the... your helmet?	N
284	00:20:16	00:20:17	I'm a lawyer.	N
285	00:20:17	00:20:19	I know my rights.	N
286	00:20:19	00:20:23	You can't sequester a domestic animal without due cause.	N
287	00:20:23	00:20:24	Well, it's coming off one way or the other, so...	N
288	00:20:25	00:20:26	Fine, fine.	N
289	00:20:34	00:20:37	Hello, Sexy.	N
290	00:20:37	00:20:39	Okay. Happy now?	N
291	00:20:40	00:20:41	Thrilled.	N
292	00:20:41	00:20:42	Let's start at the top.	N
293	00:20:42	00:20:45	What's your human name, sir?	N
294	00:20:45	00:20:47	Bud. Bud Simmons.	N
295	00:20:47	00:20:50	But I'm no criminal, and I don't have to talk to you people.	N
296	00:20:51	00:20:53	You have a very musky odor, Bud.	N
297	00:20:53	00:20:57	Quite stimulating, I imagine.	N
298	00:21:00	00:21:07	Look, we found blue fibers similar to the ones on your costume in the stomach of a dead man.	N
299	00:21:07	00:21:09	Bob Pitt.	N
300	00:21:09	00:21:10	Huh?	N
301	00:21:10	00:21:13	You may know him as Rocky Raccoon?	N
302	00:21:13	00:21:17	You think my costume killed Rocky?	N
303	00:21:17	00:21:20	We think it may have incapacitated him.	N
304	00:21:20	00:21:22	Rocky was...	N
305	00:21:22	00:21:24	skritching me.	N
306	00:21:24	00:21:25	That's one I haven't heard.	N
307	00:21:26	00:21:28	Skritching is like grooming.	N
308	00:21:28	00:21:31	It's friendly scratching.	N
309	00:21:31	00:21:40	People who don't know each other can't just nuzzle and trade tummy-rubs, but for animals, skritching is perfectly normal.	N
310	00:21:40	00:21:43	Well, killing is perfectly normal for them, too.	N
311	00:21:43	00:21:45	It doesn't make it legal for you.	N
312	00:21:52	00:21:58	Well, clearly, this kitty costume is where Bud felt safe enough to skritch.	N
313	00:21:58	00:22:03	I wonder if he also felt safe enough to explore some of the more...	N
314	00:22:03	00:22:06	aggressive aspects of his animus.	N
315	00:22:06	00:22:12	So, if we follow the ipecac and civet oil, maybe it'll lead us to the shooter.	Y
316	00:22:14	00:22:16	I don't see a compartment for a concealed rifle.	N
317	00:22:46	00:22:55	Okay, well... I've heard of some guys getting off in some weird ways, but humping an animal suit?	N
318	00:22:55	00:22:57	Well, whatever happened to normal sex?	N
319	00:22:57	00:22:59	What is normal sex?	N
320	00:22:59	00:23:06	Uh, you think it's natural for a grown human to only be intimate with a talking animal?	N
321	00:23:06	00:23:09	Well, Freud said that the only unnatural sexual behavior was to have none at all.	N
322	00:23:09	00:23:13	And after that, it's just a question of opportunity and preference.	N
323	00:23:13	00:23:18	And evidently, many prefer the feel of fur to the texture of human skin.	N
324	00:23:18	00:23:23	Well, I like hairy chests, but I'm not about to bop a six-foot weasel.	N
325	00:23:24	00:23:29	Bud is starting to look like a pretty bad cat.	N
326	00:23:29	00:23:32	Trace from his costume.	N
327	00:23:32	00:23:36	Well, identical to the trace we found in Rocky Raccoon's vomit.	N
328	00:23:36	00:23:39	Ipecac and civet oil.	N
329	00:23:39	00:23:41	Well, that's what you get for eating...	N
330	00:23:48	00:23:53	What kind of a knucklehead rolls into PD wearing pants with blood on them?	N
331	00:23:53	00:23:56	The kind that knows eventually, the cops are going to want to talk to him.	N
332	00:23:56	00:23:57	Yeah.	N
333	00:23:58	00:23:59	Preemptive strike, huh?	N
334	00:23:59	00:24:03	There's only one drop here, and it originated on the inside of the cuff.	N
335	00:24:03	00:24:06	I don't think George knew he had blood on him.	N
336	00:24:07	00:24:09	We need to get this to Greg.	N
337	00:24:09	00:24:10	I was in that freezer.	N
338	00:24:10	00:24:12	Man, there was spatter everywhere.	N
339	00:24:13	00:24:19	Now, assuming that is Al's blood, how does George not get it on the outside of his pants?	N
340	00:24:21	00:24:23	Do you think George is telling the truth?	N
341	00:24:26	00:24:29	Room temperature 72 degrees.	N
342	00:24:29	00:24:31	Okay...	N
343	00:24:32	00:24:34	...fire in the hole.	N
344	00:24:43	00:24:46	That's what blood spatter looks like at room temperature.	N
345	00:24:46	00:24:48	Now for the good stuff.	N
346	00:24:48	00:24:51	Changing one variable.	N
347	00:24:51	00:24:55	Dropping temperature to 22 degrees.	N
348	00:25:07	00:25:11	That explains how only one drop of blood got on the inside of George's pants.	N
349	00:25:18	00:25:21	When he left the freezer, the drop melted.	N
350	00:25:21	00:25:23	Shooter was standing in front of Al.	Y
351	00:25:23	00:25:25	A spatter went back and to the sides.	N
352	00:25:25	00:25:28	George is not the shooter.	N
353	00:25:28	00:25:32	So, who is the masked man?	Y
354	00:25:32	00:25:34	Well, Lone Ranger had Tonto.	N
355	00:25:34	00:25:35	Some doofus has George.	N
356	00:25:36	00:25:40	Tape lifts from your suspect's clothing, loaded with paint chips.	N
357	00:25:40	00:25:41	What kind?	N
358	00:25:41	00:25:42	Dual layers.	N
359	00:25:42	00:25:44	The bottom one's burgundy vehicle paint.	N
360	00:25:44	00:25:47	Factory pigment used on 1984 Monte Carlo.	N
361	00:25:47	00:25:48	What's the top layer?	N
362	00:25:48	00:25:53	In an unprecedented move, whoever it was painted over the burgundy with...	N
363	00:25:54	00:25:55	Want to venture a guess?	N
364	00:25:57	00:25:59	Bright blue house paint.	N
365	00:25:59	00:26:01	Doofus.	N
366	00:26:01	00:26:02	Why would somebody use house paint on a car?	N
367	00:26:02	00:26:06	Maybe he remodeled the breakfast nook and had some left over. Who knows?	Y
368	00:26:06	00:26:08	I don't try to figure out what people do anymore.	N
369	00:26:08	00:26:09	That's smart.	N
370	00:26:09	00:26:11	Yeah, I know.	N
371	00:26:11	00:26:13	Oil and water.	N
372	00:26:13	00:26:15	Love to be there when his hood starts to peel.	Y
373	00:26:15	00:26:17	Okay, first things first.	N
374	00:26:17	00:26:19	Let's go find the car.	N
375	00:26:19	00:26:22	Okay, Bud, I'm going to get right to it.	N
376	00:26:22	00:26:25	Bob Pitt's semen was found all over your kitty costume.	N
377	00:26:25	00:26:26	You lied to us.	N
378	00:26:26	00:26:29	You were doing a little more than grooming.	N
379	00:26:31	00:26:36	It started as a skritch, then everyone got in a furpile and pretty soon, we were all yiffing.	N
380	00:26:42	00:26:44	I get furpile.	N
381	00:26:44	00:26:47	Define yiffing.	N
382	00:26:47	00:26:56	In a furpile, when all the animals start rubbing and wiggling, some of them start to do things.	N
383	00:27:10	00:27:14	The kind of things that leave semen on your fur?	N
384	00:27:14	00:27:15	That never happened before.	N
385	00:27:17	00:27:18	Okay.	N
386	00:27:18	00:27:20	That happened before.	N
387	00:27:20	00:27:21	I know what you're thinking.	N
388	00:27:21	00:27:22	You couldn't possibly.	N
389	00:27:22	00:27:24	I didn't kill Rocky Raccoon.	N
390	00:27:24	00:27:26	Did you smear ipecac and civet oil on the back of your costume?	N
391	00:27:26	00:27:28	That's crazy.	N
392	00:27:28	00:27:29	I was there for the yiffing, and that's all.	N
393	00:27:29	00:27:35	Look, if I don't have my costume on, I pretty much can't get yiffed.	N
394	00:27:35	00:27:37	Okay, Bud.	N
395	00:27:37	00:27:41	We're going to leave you some time to think about it.	N
396	00:27:41	00:27:44	Enjoy your new costume.	N
397	00:27:51	00:27:53	Are you buying this guy?	N
398	00:27:53	00:27:56	Oh, who the hell knows what goes on in a furpile?	N
399	00:27:56	00:28:01	But if somebody doused their special scent on Kitty's back, I'm sure he's going to want to know who did it.	N
400	00:28:01	00:28:04	Well, he gives us all the furnames of people in the pile.	N
401	00:28:04	00:28:06	What are we going to do-- put out an APB on Tom and Jerry?	N
402	00:28:06	00:28:12	Maybe we just ask him where the hip, young plushy-on-the-go likes to hang out?	N
403	00:28:37	00:28:38	Password, please?	N
404	00:28:38	00:28:41	E-I-E-I-O?	N
405	00:28:41	00:28:43	This is a private party.	N
406	00:28:43	00:28:47	Uh, we have an invitation from the Las Vegas Police Department.	N
407	00:28:47	00:28:49	Uh, okay.	N
408	00:29:04	00:29:06	Whoa, Nellie!	N
409	00:29:08	00:29:10	Is this a raid?	N
410	00:29:10	00:29:12	It's a homicide investigation.	N
411	00:29:12	00:29:20	Look, we need you to stop skritching or yiffing or whatever, take off your costumes, and tell us your names.	N
412	00:29:30	00:29:31	Ooh!	N
413	00:29:31	00:29:33	These costumes are pretty marinated.	N
414	00:29:33	00:29:36	Smokey could've used some deodorant.	N
415	00:29:36	00:29:40	Well, you know, pheromones are the basis for mammalian reproduction.	N
416	00:29:40	00:29:44	When the female is in estrus, the male picks up on her come-get-me scent.	N
417	00:29:46	00:29:50	But most mammals only copulate seasonally.	N
418	00:29:50	00:29:52	How boring.	N
419	00:29:52	00:29:54	For some.	N
420	00:29:57	00:30:00	No one else in that furpile threw up, right?	N
421	00:30:01	00:30:05	Uh, Rocky was a target.	N
422	00:30:14	00:30:17	Smell this.	N
423	00:30:23	00:30:25	Civet oil and ipecac.	N
424	00:30:27	00:30:30	So I guess we're looking for a wolf...	N
425	00:30:30	00:30:32	in wolf's clothing.	N
426	00:30:33	00:30:43	Mr. Lee, the concentration of ipecac and civet oil on your paws speaks to application, rather than accidental transfer.	N
427	00:30:43	00:30:44	Okay. Fine.	N
428	00:30:44	00:30:55	I... I mixed up some ipecac and some civet oil and I-I... I rubbed it on Sexy... Sexy Kitty.	N
429	00:31:00	00:31:02	Why Sexy Kitty?	N
430	430	430	00:31:02	00:31:04	'Cause Rocky couldn't get enough of her.	N
431	00:31:04	00:31:06	What did Rocky do to you?	N
432	00:31:06	00:31:08	He's a raccoon.	N
433	00:31:08	00:31:10	They're all lowlifes.	N
434	00:31:10	00:31:14	I mean, honestly, what do they do?	N
435	00:31:14	00:31:16	Screw...	N
436	00:31:16	00:31:18	eat garbage...	N
437	00:31:18	00:31:20	screw some more.	N
438	00:31:20	00:31:25	Is this a, uh, general observation, or possibly a personal grievance?	N
439	00:31:27	00:31:32	At last year's convention, Rocky stole my girlfriend.	N
440	00:31:32	00:31:38	And in the wild, wolves are monogamous, but raccoons are promiscuous.	N
441	00:31:38	00:31:40	That's right.	N
442	00:31:42	00:31:52	And I just, I knew, I knew since Sexy Kitty was Rocky's fave, he'd have his filthy raccoon mouth all over her again this year.	N
443	00:31:52	00:31:58	All I wanted to do was make him sick enough so that he'd have to go home and stop cheating on my mate.	N
444	00:31:58	00:32:00	Your ex-mate?	N
445	00:32:01	00:32:02	Yes.	N
446	00:32:02	00:32:08	I couldn't take seeing what that wanna-be marsupial put her through.	N
447	00:32:08	00:32:11	My Linda Lamb deserved better.	N
448	00:32:11	00:32:13	Mr. Lee, you're a wolf.	N
449	00:32:13	00:32:15	How'd you end up with a lamb?	N
450	00:32:15	00:32:19	I used to work with Linda.	N
451	00:32:19	00:32:23	And one day, I found out about what she did on the weekends.	N
452	00:32:25	00:32:28	And she helped me...	N
453	00:32:29	00:32:31	become who I am.	N
454	00:32:31	00:32:34	I always knew that I was a...	N
455	00:32:34	00:32:36	something else.	N
456	00:32:36	00:32:42	And... Linda made it real.	N
457	00:32:45	00:32:48	She was one of a kind.	N
458	00:32:48	00:32:52	Does, uh, Linda Lamb have a human last name?	N
459	00:32:53	00:32:56	Jones.	N
460	00:32:56	00:32:57	Why?	N
461	00:33:06	00:33:09	Linda Jones is Linda Lamb.	N
462	00:33:09	00:33:10	Damn it.	N
463	00:33:11	00:33:12	This was here the whole time.	N
464	00:33:12	00:33:14	Yeah, but evidence without context is not evidence.	N
465	00:33:14	00:33:17	We had no reason to search the trunk.	N
466	00:33:17	00:33:20	So she didn't just hit Rocky, she knew him.	N
467	00:33:20	00:33:24	For the philandering raccoon that he was.	N
468	00:33:28	00:33:38	Okay, assuming that Linda and Bob were heading home after Bob got sick at the hotel, how did he end up on the side of the road?	N
469	00:33:38	00:33:41	You ever have a car-fight?	N
470	00:33:42	00:33:46	Well, if a couple has any kind of history together, they know how to press each other's buttons.	N
471	00:33:47	00:33:52	And you lock 'em up in a metal box with wheels on a bad night, they're going to start pressing 'em.	N
472	00:33:52	00:33:54	You follow?	N
473	00:33:54	00:34:00	So, uh, either Bob told Linda to stop the car and let him out, or she told him to start walking?	N
474	00:34:00	00:34:01	Yes. That one.	N
475	00:34:03	00:34:11	I mean, it's bad enough that raccoon-boy blows his girlfriend off to go fur-piling-- he gets sick licking some nasty kitty and makes Lambchop drive him home.	N
476	00:34:15	00:34:18	why did she turn the car around and head back toward the hotel?	N
477	00:34:18	00:34:21	Well, she wasn't heading back to the hotel.	N
478	00:34:21	00:34:22	She was heading back for him.	N
479	479	479	00:34:22	00:34:25	'Cause that's how car-fights always end.	N
480	00:34:25	00:34:30	After about a mile or two, you start to feel guilty that you've abandoned the person, and you turn around.	N
481	00:34:31	00:34:33	Except she didn't plan on an 18-wheeler finishing her off.	N
482	00:34:33	00:34:36	Mack truck ex machina.	N
483	00:34:37	00:34:41	But it still doesn't explain how Bob got shot in the back.	N
484	00:34:41	00:34:43	No...	N
485	00:34:43	00:34:47	but I think I may know the last person who saw them alive.	N
486	00:34:47	00:34:53	Why don't we ask the valet if he remembers a couple of... furriest conventioneers?	N
487	00:34:56	00:35:00	Hey, Sara, no luck on the car, but Hodges ran the gunstock adhesive.	N
488	00:35:00	00:35:06	It's primarily an epoxy polyester resin with traces of styrene and benzyl peroxide and ground terra-cotta.	N
489	00:35:06	00:35:08	Is that supposed to mean something to me?	N
490	00:35:08	00:35:09	Terra-cotta's the giveaway.	N
491	00:35:09	00:35:10	It's a granite glue.	N
492	00:35:10	00:35:11	Granite glue?	N
493	00:35:11	00:35:14	Yeah. It's used for adhering joints on big pieces of stone.	N
494	00:35:14	00:35:17	House paint on his car; granite glue on his gun...	Y
495	00:35:17	00:35:18	Well, he used what was available.	Y
496	00:35:18	00:35:19	That's what people do.	N
497	00:35:19	00:35:21	Well, I understand the house paint, but where do you get granite glue?	N
498	00:35:21	00:35:22	I already checked.	N
499	00:35:23	00:35:26	There's not too many places in Clark County that specialize in granite installation, so...	N
500	00:35:26	00:35:33	Okay, I will bet you a double-double animal style that one of them employs a guy with a blue 1984 Monte Carlo.	Y
501	00:35:33	00:35:34	That's a bet.	N
502	00:35:34	00:35:35	Excellent.	N
503	00:35:40	00:35:42	Damn straight I remember them.	N
504	00:35:42	00:35:47	How often do you see a six-foot raccoon heaving out a car window?	N
505	00:35:47	00:35:48	Dude was hammered, man.	N
506	00:35:48	00:35:51	His girl... she was pissed.	N
507	00:35:51	00:35:52	Thank you.	N
508	00:35:52	00:35:53	You've been very helpful.	N
509	00:35:53	00:35:54	All right, no problem.	N
510	00:35:55	00:35:56	Hey, I got that.	N
511	00:35:56	00:35:58	So, there's your car-fight.	N
512	00:35:58	00:36:05	Now she thinks that he's back on the booze, which he denies, but the sicker he gets, the more she thinks he's lying.	N
513	00:36:05	00:36:08	I can't believe you're drinking again.	N
514	00:36:08	00:36:09	You promised.	N
515	00:36:09	00:36:10	I was not drinking.	N
516	00:36:13	00:36:14	Must be food poisoning.	N
517	00:36:14	00:36:16	Oh?	N
518	00:36:16	00:36:18	Didn't know they served food in a furpile.	N
519	00:36:18	00:36:21	The Righteously Angry versus the Wrongly Accused.	N
520	00:36:21	00:36:23	And the battle's just beginning.	N
521	00:36:24	00:36:26	Would you just take off the mask and talk to me?!	N
522	00:36:26	00:36:28	No, just pull over and let me out of the car!	N
523	00:36:28	00:36:29	You want out? Ah...	N
524	00:36:30	00:36:31	Get out! Just get out!	N
525	00:36:32	00:36:36	Okay, so it makes sense up to that point, but then what?	N
526	00:36:36	00:36:38	He gets out and...	N
527	00:36:39	00:36:41	...she shoots him?	N
528	00:36:41	00:36:46	I'm not so sure that people who dress up like cuddly forest creatures carry guns.	N
529	00:36:46	00:36:48	You don't think they allow plushies in the NRA?	N
530	00:36:50	00:36:52	All right, then who shot him?	N
531	00:36:52	00:36:53	Well, we have a grassy knoll...	N
532	00:36:53	00:36:56	but no Lee Harvey Oswald.	N
533	00:36:57	00:37:02	You're a triple threat-- robbery, kidnapping, murder.	Y
534	00:37:02	00:37:07	Big &amp; Best Foods, Al Sesto, George Bartell.	N
535	00:37:07	00:37:09	Any of this resonate?	N
536	00:37:09	00:37:11	I don't know no Al Sesto.	Y
537	00:37:13	00:37:15	Virgil, is that your shotgun?	Y
538	00:37:15	00:37:16	We found it in your garage.	Y
539	00:37:16	00:37:20	If, uh, you look, you'll see a chip in the stock.	Y
540	00:37:20	00:37:23	We found that in the freezer at the Big &amp; Best Foods.	N
541	00:37:25	00:37:27	Is this your car?	Y
542	00:37:27	00:37:29	It was also in your garage.	Y
543	00:37:29	00:37:34	It has dual-layered paint, identical to the dual-layered paint chips we found on your kidnap victim.	Y
544	00:37:35	00:37:37	Anything to say, tough guy?	Y
545	00:37:37	00:37:38	Yeah.	N
546	00:37:38	00:37:40	I want a lawyer.	Y
547	00:38:12	00:38:13	Hey, Grissom.	N
548	00:38:13	00:38:16	Over here. I found the bullet.	N
549	00:38:24	00:38:26	Well done.	N
550	00:38:26	00:38:35	So, we got a sick raccoon with an abdominal through-and-through who was shot from what appears to be a fairly steep trajectory.	N
551	00:38:35	00:38:43	So, either he was shot by a giant... or he was, uh, on all fours.	N
552	00:38:45	00:38:48	Or both.	N
553	00:38:48	00:38:56	I mean, imagine what it must have looked like out here at night and from a distance.	N
554	00:38:59	00:39:01	We've been looking for...	N
555	00:39:01	00:39:05	a person who shot a person, but...	N
556	00:39:07	00:39:10	...maybe we should be looking for a person who shot an animal.	N
557	00:39:18	00:39:20	Hey, Virgil.	Y
558	00:39:21	00:39:23	What are you doing here?	Y
559	00:39:23	00:39:24	What am I doing here?	Y
560	00:39:24	00:39:26	Yeah. Why, you guys know each other?	Y
561	00:39:26	00:39:28	Yeah, that's my cousin.	Y
562	00:39:28	00:39:29	Pahrump?	N
563	00:39:31	00:39:33	My own blood, and you set me up.	Y
564	00:39:33	00:39:35	After I saved your ass.	Y
565	00:39:35	00:39:37	I should have shot you in that freezer.	Y
566	00:39:37	00:39:38	You son of a bitch!	Y
567	00:39:38	00:39:39	Hey, hey!	N
568	00:39:39	00:39:40	You looking for more time?	Y
569	00:39:40	00:39:41	Now come on.	N
570	00:39:43	00:39:45	Oh, man.	Y
571	00:39:48	00:39:49	I'm so stupid.	N
572	00:39:49	00:39:50	Ah, you're not stupid.	N
573	00:39:50	00:39:53	Man, your cousin just set you up.	Y
574	00:39:53	00:39:54	Bowling night.	N
575	00:39:54	00:39:56	Is that where you told him about the vending machines?	Y
576	00:39:56	00:40:00	And Petey's burger runs?	N
577	00:40:00	00:40:02	My own cousin.	Y
578	00:40:02	00:40:09	Well... George, sometimes people, they, uh, disappoint us.	N
579	00:40:09	00:40:11	Why?	N
580	00:40:24	00:40:25	How you doing?	N
581	00:40:25	00:40:26	Can I help you?	Y
582	00:40:26	00:40:28	We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
583	00:40:28	00:40:30	This your place? Yeah.	Y
584	00:40:30	00:40:31	Must be here about that accident.	N
585	00:40:31	00:40:32	Terrible thing.	N
586	00:40:32	00:40:37	Like I said to the wife, the way these 18-wheelers fly down here ballin' the jack, I ain't surprised.	Y
587	00:40:37	00:40:39	I'm surprised there ain't more accidents.	Y
588	00:40:39	00:40:43	Why don't you give us a brief history of your evening?	Y
589	00:40:43	00:40:46	Ah, well, I had dinner with the missus.	Y
590	00:40:46	00:40:48	Uh, fed the scraps to the dogs.	N
591	00:40:48	00:40:50	Uh, watched Jeopardy.	N
592	00:40:51	00:40:55	Could hardly hear it, the dogs were, uh, so stirred up.	N
593	00:40:55	00:40:58	Went outside to take a look, spotted a coyote.	N
594	00:40:58	00:40:59	This is my business.	N
595	00:40:59	00:41:01	Purebreds. Wouldn't want to lose one.	N
596	00:41:01	00:41:04	So, I, uh, took care of it.	Y
597	00:41:04	00:41:07	Came back inside in time for Final Jeopardy.	N
598	00:41:10	00:41:13	So the raccoon was mistaken for a coyote.	N
599	00:41:13	00:41:15	You gotta be kidding me.	N
600	00:41:15	00:41:20	He was dosed intentionally, but killed accidentally.	N
601	00:41:20	00:41:24	We got the ranger's rifle, we collected a bullet at the scene, and ballistics made a match.	Y
602	00:41:24	00:41:31	Bob Pitt was sick when he got out of the car, wounded when he got onto the road, and dead when he hit the dirt.	N
603	00:41:31	00:41:34	Get out! Just get out!	N
604	00:41:56	00:42:03	Well, the rancher's going to get off, Linda's dead, and Wolfie...	Y
605	00:42:03	00:42:05	skates with a misdemeanor.	N
606	00:42:05	00:42:12	We took one look at those furry suits and thought foul play, but this was really just a domestic dispute gone mad.	N
607	00:42:12	00:42:15	Hmm. Fur and loathing in Las Vegas.	N
