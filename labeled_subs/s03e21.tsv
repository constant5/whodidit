0	00:00:38	00:00:42	Hey, folks, we've hit a little more of that pesky turbulence.	N
1	00:00:42	00:00:47	If you'd kindly take your seats we should be arriving on the hour.	N
2	00:00:48	00:00:50	Cheers.	N
3	00:01:40	00:01:43	The victim's name is Lori Hutchins.	N
4	00:01:43	00:01:46	Apparently, she chaperoned the horse on trips all the time.	N
5	00:01:47	00:01:51	Baggage handler found the body in the cargo hold after the passengers had disembarked.	N
6	00:01:51	00:01:53	We're going to need to process everyone on that plane.	N
7	00:01:54	00:01:56	Well, they're being corralled as we speak, partner.	N
8	00:01:56	00:01:58	Where to start?	N
9	00:01:58	00:02:01	First witness, first suspect.	N
10	00:02:04	00:02:05	The horse?	N
11	00:02:07	00:02:09	Of course.	N
12	00:03:00	00:03:02	All right, let's talk about Lori Hutchins.	N
13	00:03:02	00:03:04	What can you tell me about her?	N
14	00:03:04	00:03:07	She was sweet, polite, quiet.	N
15	00:03:07	00:03:09	Horses were her life.	N
16	00:03:09	00:03:11	She was great with them.	N
17	00:03:11	00:03:13	And she always traveled down below with the horse?	N
18	00:03:13	00:03:15	Checked on her twice during the flight.	N
19	00:03:15	00:03:17	Brought her dinner about three hours in.	N
20	00:03:17	00:03:20	She was worried about the horse, but that was nothing new.	N
21	00:03:20	00:03:22	So nothing unusual.	N
22	00:03:22	00:03:25	There was some turbulence, but nothing outrageous.	N
23	00:03:25	00:03:29	We had an emergency call button down there, if something went wrong.	N
24	00:03:29	00:03:31	Lori never used it.	N
25	00:04:05	00:04:06	Where's the horse?	N
26	00:04:07	00:04:09	USDA facility.	N
27	00:04:09	00:04:13	Mandatory 48-hour quarantine.	N
28	00:04:13	00:04:18	A hundred-pound woman trampled by a 1,400-pound horse?	N
29	00:04:18	00:04:19	Doesn't seem very fair.	N
30	00:04:27	00:04:28	Tranquilizer dart.	N
31	00:04:28	00:04:30	Changes the odds a little.	N
32	00:04:30	00:04:32	Mmm.	N
33	00:04:43	00:04:44	Yeah...	N
34	00:04:44	00:04:45	heavy artillery.	N
35	00:04:45	00:04:47	More than one way to handicap a horse.	N
36	00:06:38	00:06:40	What have you got?	N
37	00:06:40	00:06:43	Trainer had all these small syringes.	N
38	00:06:43	00:06:46	Why go for the big guns instead?	N
39	00:06:46	00:06:49	Mmm... maybe she didn't want to get too close to a spooked horse.	N
40	00:06:50	00:06:52	What about this food?	N
41	00:06:52	00:06:56	Steward said he brought her some dinner.	N
42	00:06:58	00:06:59	Guess she wasn't very hungry.	N
43	00:06:59	00:07:02	Looks like someone stepped in horse crap.	N
44	00:07:05	00:07:07	And what was the vic wearing?	N
45	00:07:07	00:07:10	Work boots, I think.	N
46	00:07:11	00:07:13	That's a funky print.	N
47	00:07:14	00:07:17	Oh... a J.P. Tod's driving loafer.	N
48	00:07:17	00:07:19	Hmm?	N
49	00:07:19	00:07:21	I may shop the outlets...	N
50	00:07:21	00:07:22	but I read Vogue.	N
51	00:07:22	00:07:25	This is Death Valley, huh?	N
52	00:07:25	00:07:28	You get lost out here, you're toast.	N
53	00:07:29	00:07:31	That may have been the idea.	N
54	00:07:42	00:07:45	Helicopter tour pilot noted it and called it in.	N
55	00:07:45	00:07:46	Deathbed...	N
56	00:07:46	00:07:48	casket-ready.	N
57	00:07:48	00:07:51	Laying in the Hell's Gate section of Death Valley.	N
58	00:07:51	00:07:52	Poetic.	N
59	00:07:53	00:07:55	More like suicidal.	N
60	00:07:57	00:07:59	Is that bird crap?	N
61	00:08:09	00:08:11	Could be.	N
62	00:08:20	00:08:21	Toby Wellstone.	N
63	00:08:21	00:08:23	McKinley High School.	N
64	00:08:23	00:08:25	12/12/87.	N
65	00:08:28	00:08:30	What's that on his hand?	N
66	00:08:32	00:08:36	Looks like a transdermal patch.	N
67	00:08:36	00:08:37	Fetanyl.	N
68	00:08:37	00:08:41	Pores in the hand make for faster absorption.	N
69	00:08:41	00:08:45	Intentional overdose. I'll notify the parents.	N
70	00:08:45	00:08:48	We're 85 miles from Las Vegas, one mile from the closest road.	N
71	00:08:49	00:08:51	If this was a solo job, how did he get here?	N
72	00:08:51	00:08:55	I see some tracks over there, but...	N
73	00:08:55	00:08:57	a surveyor's tool...	N
74	00:08:57	00:09:00	a remote-controlled car...	N
75	00:09:00	00:09:04	Anything with wheels.	N
76	00:09:11	00:09:13	Oh, I'll tell you.	N
77	00:09:13	00:09:15	Some days, it's tough to be me.	N
78	00:09:15	00:09:18	You know, I wish that the seats were as organized as that bar.	N
79	00:09:18	00:09:19	We have the passenger manifest.	N
80	00:09:19	00:09:24	No assigned seating, 12 passengers 24 shoes, 36 lawyers.	N
81	00:09:24	00:09:26	What was this, a smoking flight?	N
82	00:09:26	00:09:30	Yeah, I think we've established the fact that these people do whatever it is they want.	N
83	00:09:34	00:09:38	Now, please, don't make me ALS.	N
84	00:09:38	00:09:41	Hey, man, I don't want to go blind any more than you do.	N
85	00:09:42	00:09:44	Oh...	N
86	00:09:44	00:09:47	looky here.	N
87	00:09:47	00:09:48	Little DNA party.	N
88	00:09:52	00:09:53	Ooh.	N
89	00:09:53	00:09:55	Bloody towels.	N
90	00:09:55	00:09:58	Well, at least something made it into the trash can.	N
91	00:09:58	00:10:00	I'm sorry, ma'am.	N
92	00:10:00	00:10:02	You may not enter the quarantine area.	N
93	00:10:02	00:10:07	I know it's 48 hours, I know the rules, but I need to see my horse.	N
94	00:10:08	00:10:10	I want to talk to Dr. Stevens.	N
95	00:10:10	00:10:11	He's my vet.	N
96	00:10:11	00:10:13	Sorry.	N
97	00:10:14	00:10:16	Hi, Dr. Stevens.	N
98	00:10:16	00:10:18	How's she doing?	N
99	00:10:18	00:10:20	Shaken up.	N
100	00:10:21	00:10:24	Horses are incredibly sensitive to change.	N
101	00:10:24	00:10:25	Travel's hard on them.	N
102	00:10:25	00:10:27	How about losing a trainer?	N
103	00:10:27	00:10:28	Like losing a best friend.	N
104	00:10:29	00:10:31	I just don't understand how this could've happened.	N
105	00:10:31	00:10:34	We're going to need to pull some samples from that horse.	N
106	00:10:34	00:10:36	Okay.	N
107	00:10:51	00:10:52	Thank you.	N
108	00:10:59	00:11:02	This looks recent. What happened here?	N
109	00:11:02	00:11:04	High Folly is what we call a dirty mare.	N
110	00:11:04	00:11:06	Prone to serious uterine infections.	N
111	00:11:14	00:11:18	Caslick stitching keeps out fluids and bacteria.	N
112	00:11:18	00:11:20	So you stitch her up until it's time to breed?	N
113	00:11:20	00:11:26	I know it sounds bad, but I promise having an acute infection is worse.	N
114	00:11:26	00:11:31	And there's no greater tragedy than a champion who can't breed.	N
115	00:11:31	00:11:34	Is this some kind of food?	N
116	00:11:35	00:11:37	I don't know. It could be.	N
117	00:11:37	00:11:38	We'll need a blood sample.	N
118	00:11:38	00:11:40	We found a tranquilizer gun in the container.	N
119	00:11:40	00:11:42	We want to double-check it.	N
120	00:11:42	00:11:44	You'd never use a tranq gun on a horse.	N
121	00:11:44	00:11:49	The impact energy would cause an immediate adrenaline response.	N
122	00:11:49	00:11:50	Make the horse more agitated.	N
123	00:11:50	00:11:52	We'll still need that sample.	N
124	00:11:56	00:11:58	Hey. Nobody's here to claim the body?	N
125	00:11:58	00:11:59	Nope.	N
126	00:11:59	00:12:03	I don't know what's worse, consoling a grieving parent, or finding a kid with no parents at all.	N
127	00:12:03	00:12:05	No parents?	N
128	00:12:05	00:12:08	No, this kid has been through seven foster homes in seven years.	N
129	00:12:08	00:12:10	System lost track of him a year ago.	N
130	00:12:10	00:12:12	McKinley High School said the same thing.	N
131	00:12:12	00:12:14	He was out more than he was in.	N
132	00:12:14	00:12:15	Kid was a ghost.	N
133	00:12:16	00:12:23	Treated himself to a hamburger with pickles and ketchup, chocolate shake, and what I can only assume was super-size fries.	N
134	00:12:23	00:12:25	So that's what killed him.	N
135	00:12:25	00:12:26	That's a five-course meal to a teenager.	N
136	00:12:26	00:12:28	More like a last supper, I'm afraid.	N
137	00:12:29	00:12:31	He took a synthetic narcotic, fentanyl.	N
138	00:12:31	00:12:32	By patch and by pill.	N
139	00:12:32	00:12:35	Yeah, that's a painkiller.	N
140	00:12:35	00:12:36	Used in hospitals, post-surgery.	N
141	00:12:36	00:12:38	What is...	N
142	00:12:38	00:12:40	cisapride?	N
143	00:12:40	00:12:42	That what separates the attempts from the corpses.	N
144	00:12:42	00:12:49	It's a prokenetic agent that speeds up the body's absorption of fentanyl and it keeps the stomach acids from going into reflux.	N
145	00:12:57	00:12:59	No nausea, no vomit.	N
146	00:12:59	00:13:01	No vomit, no chance of survival.	N
147	00:13:01	00:13:02	Kid did his homework.	N
148	00:13:02	00:13:05	Permanent solution to a temporary problem.	N
149	00:13:05	00:13:07	Maybe not so temporary.	N
150	00:13:07	00:13:10	80% of all completed suicides have tried previously.	N
151	00:13:10	00:13:12	From the scarring, I'd say twice before.	N
152	00:13:16	00:13:18	Third time's the charm.	N
153	00:13:58	00:14:00	Hey, fashionista.	N
154	00:14:00	00:14:02	Brass collected all the shoes. You were right.	N
155	00:14:02	00:14:05	Not only did we find a match, but I also found trace elements.	N
156	00:14:05	00:14:06	Equus caballus?	N
157	00:14:07	00:14:08	Horse dung all the way.	N
158	00:14:08	00:14:09	Brass is bringing her in now.	N
159	00:14:09	00:14:10	Thanks.	N
160	00:14:10	00:14:19	Our horse trainer has paramortem bruising and scraping, ranging from minor to major, all consistent with being trampled.	N
161	00:14:22	00:14:24	Pinpoints.	N
162	00:14:24	00:14:26	An opiate overdose?	N
163	00:14:26	00:14:27	Torphine.	N
164	00:14:27	00:14:30	A thousand times as potent as morphine.	N
165	00:14:30	00:14:31	Tranquilizer.	N
166	00:14:31	00:14:32	Mm-hmm.	N
167	00:14:32	00:14:37	One of the bruises contains a puncture wound about the same size as that dart you found.	N
168	00:14:38	00:14:42	How do you shoot yourself in the shoulder with a tranquilizer rifle?	N
169	00:14:42	00:14:43	Someone else shot her.	N
170	00:14:44	00:14:46	And framed the horse.	N
171	00:14:47	00:14:51	Miss Fitzgerald, your shoe print was found in the cargo hold where Lori Hutchins' body was found.	N
172	00:14:52	00:14:54	Please... call me Harper.	N
173	00:14:54	00:14:56	Were you down there, Harper?	N
174	00:14:56	00:14:57	Yes.	N
175	00:14:57	00:15:00	It is my plane. I can go wherever I please.	N
176	00:15:00	00:15:02	Lady...	N
177	00:15:02	00:15:04	why were you down there?	N
178	00:15:04	00:15:05	To woo her.	N
179	00:15:05	00:15:08	I know how much Merrit is paying you.	N
180	00:15:08	00:15:11	Why don't you write your own check?	N
181	00:15:11	00:15:14	Thank you, all the same, but I'm not making any changes right now.	N
182	00:15:14	00:15:18	You don't strike me as the kind of woman who'd take no for an answer.	N
183	00:15:18	00:15:19	Mmm... I'm not.	N
184	00:15:19	00:15:21	I figured she'd come around.	N
185	00:15:22	00:15:23	Besides...	N
186	00:15:23	00:15:26	she's no use to me dead.	N
187	00:15:26	00:15:27	We need a DNA sample.	N
188	00:15:28	00:15:30	Open up.	N
189	00:15:48	00:15:50	Getting a strange sense of deja vu.	N
190	00:15:50	00:15:52	It's raining bodies here.	N
191	00:15:55	00:15:58	National Park Service found her.	N
192	00:15:58	00:16:00	She was beyond our perimeter.	N
193	00:16:00	00:16:02	We had no reason to believe that there were more bodies.	N
194	00:16:02	00:16:03	They're looking for any others.	N
195	00:16:03	00:16:05	Want to turn her over?	N
196	00:16:10	00:16:13	He's wearing a suit. She's wearing a prom dress?	N
197	00:16:13	00:16:16	That's weird.	N
198	00:16:27	00:16:30	No prior scarring on the wrists, but the same transdermal patch.	N
199	00:16:32	00:16:36	That white substance looks like the same stuff you found near Toby's body.	N
200	00:16:36	00:16:38	Seems like Romeo had a Juliet.	N
201	00:16:38	00:16:41	Who got out of bed and ended up a half-a-mile away.	N
202	00:16:41	00:16:45	Her dress is way too big.	Y
203	00:16:48	00:16:49	What are you thinking?	N
204	00:16:49	00:16:53	Vanity, thy name is teenage girl.	N
205	00:16:53	00:16:56	They were trying to go out in style.	N
206	00:16:57	00:16:59	Something's off.	N
207	00:17:01	00:17:06	The tranquilizer gun looks like a wipe-down, and there's no prints on the ceiling dart.	N
208	00:17:06	00:17:09	How about the dart in the container?	N
209	00:17:09	00:17:11	Partial palm print. Not enough for comparison.	N
210	00:17:11	00:17:16	But, there was three different matches on the handrail leading down to the cargo bay.	N
211	00:17:16	00:17:18	A Harper Fitzgerald...	N
212	00:17:19	00:17:21	Owner of the plane.	N
213	00:17:21	00:17:22	Jason Banks...	N
214	00:17:24	00:17:26	Steward who brought the vic her dinner.	N
215	00:17:26	00:17:27	Rhone Confer.	N
216	00:17:28	00:17:31	Formerly a concierge at the Orpheus.	Y
217	00:17:31	00:17:33	Concierge...	Y
218	00:17:33	00:17:35	interesting.	N
219	00:17:36	00:17:38	It is?	Y
220	00:17:38	00:17:45	Those brown shavings that we collected from the cargo hold and the horse's teeth were tobacco.	Y
221	00:17:45	00:17:49	More specifically, of Volando and Colorado Maduro.	Y
222	00:17:49	00:17:51	Cigar tobacco.	N
223	00:17:51	00:17:57	Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but when it does not contain Propylene Glycol, an additive used in the humidification process...	Y
224	00:17:57	00:17:59	Then it's a Cuban cigar.	N
225	00:17:59	00:18:05	Dominicans are just as good, but, uh... they're legal, so, you know, where's the fun in that?	Y
226	00:18:06	00:18:11	So if I'm looking for an illegally imported Cuban cigar, I go to...	Y
227	00:18:11	00:18:13	Your handy concierge.	Y
228	00:18:13	00:18:15	What were you doing on that plane?	Y
229	00:18:15	00:18:16	I'm friendly with Harper.	Y
230	00:18:16	00:18:17	Friendly?	Y
231	00:18:17	00:18:23	Is that a job title or do you perform a specific function for that distinction?	Y
232	00:18:23	00:18:24	You don't get it.	N
233	00:18:25	00:18:26	What, what...	N
234	00:18:26	00:18:28	what's not to get?	Y
235	00:18:28	00:18:32	Uh, why don't you help us, since you're so good at getting things like Cuban cigars?	Y
236	00:18:32	00:18:34	Oh, come on.	Y
237	00:18:34	00:18:37	The embargo on Cuban cigars is ridiculous.	Y
238	00:18:37	00:18:39	It's still the law.	Y
239	00:18:39	00:18:40	You break one law, the chances are...	N
240	00:18:40	00:18:43	I never went near Lori Hutchins.	Y
241	00:18:43	00:18:48	Well, we found your prints on the rail going down into the cargo hold.	Y
242	00:18:50	00:18:51	Look.	N
243	00:18:51	00:18:55	I helped Harper out with a party at the Orpheus about a year ago.	N
244	00:18:55	00:18:56	We hit it off.	N
245	00:18:56	00:18:59	She started inviting me to things.	N
246	00:18:59	00:19:00	This is my first trip on the jet.	N
247	00:19:01	00:19:03	Now, I know I wasn't supposed to go down there, but...	N
248	00:19:03	00:19:05	all that stuff?	N
249	00:19:09	00:19:12	Hey, hey, hey, there, buddy.	N
250	00:19:12	00:19:14	That's a $60 Cuban.	N
251	00:19:18	00:19:21	I got the hell out of there, and I kept my mouth shut.	N
252	00:19:21	00:19:26	These people-- they don't tolerate a buzz kill, and I'll be damned if I'm going to be shot for being the messenger.	N
253	00:19:26	00:19:29	So the happier Harper stays, the fatter your pockets.	N
254	00:19:29	00:19:31	I really don't like to talk about money.	N
255	00:19:31	00:19:34	How about we talk about DNA?	N
256	00:20:06	00:20:08	Hello.	N
257	00:20:08	00:20:10	You get anything off of that dress?	N
258	00:20:10	00:20:13	I think our girl was a young Madame DeFarge.	N
259	00:20:13	00:20:16	She made her own death shroud, but she didn't know her own measurements.	N
260	00:20:16	00:20:18	That's kind of freaky.	N
261	00:20:18	00:20:21	Any results in the sexual assault evidence kit?	N
262	00:20:21	00:20:22	No, the kit came back negative.	N
263	00:20:22	00:20:24	The stomach contents came back the same.	Y
264	00:20:24	00:20:26	burger, fries, and a shake.	Y
265	00:20:26	00:20:31	And, also, the drug ratios were the same for fentanyl and cisapride.	Y
266	00:20:31	00:20:36	You know what else is freaky-- her prints were on his patch, and his prints were on hers.	N
267	00:20:36	00:20:38	She was a willing participant in all this.	N
268	00:20:54	00:20:57	Why didn't we find any trash at the crime scene, and why didn't we find a note?	Y
269	00:20:57	00:21:04	Well, you know, I read somewhere that only 15% of suicides actually leave a note, but you would think, with all the trouble they went through, they would want to be found.	Y
270	00:21:04	00:21:05	Together.	Y
271	00:21:05	00:21:08	Yeah, and after she was sedated, she crawls away from the scene?	N
272	00:21:08	00:21:09	Why?	Y
273	00:21:09	00:21:15	Hey, girl's library card Jill Frommer.	Y
274	00:21:15	00:21:17	Mom's coming in to I.D. the body.	Y
275	00:21:17	00:21:20	Do you recognize this dress?	Y
276	00:21:20	00:21:22	No.	N
277	00:21:22	00:21:26	Did Jill take Home Ec, or like to sew...	Y
278	00:21:26	00:21:28	Jill? Please.	N
279	00:21:28	00:21:32	No, Jill didn't do anything domestic.	N
280	00:21:33	00:21:38	You only realize what you want to teach them after it's too late.	Y
281	00:21:38	00:21:40	Toby Wellstone...	Y
282	00:21:40	00:21:43	he lived with you as a foster kid about five years ago?	N
283	00:21:43	00:21:45	Yeah, for about a year, and then I sent him back.	N
284	00:21:45	00:21:47	Can I ask why?	Y
285	00:21:47	00:21:51	My husband died of cancer, and I couldn't handle Toby alone.	Y
286	00:21:51	00:21:54	That boy was just way out of control.	Y
287	00:21:54	00:21:56	And then about...	Y
288	00:21:56	00:21:59	about a year ago, Jill brings him home.	Y
289	00:21:59	00:22:00	Mom, look at Toby's back.	N
290	00:22:00	00:22:02	He can't stay there.	Y
291	00:22:02	00:22:05	It's not safe; you have to help, please.	Y
292	00:22:05	00:22:06	And you did.	N
293	00:22:06	00:22:09	It didn't seem like I had any choice.	N
294	00:22:09	00:22:11	I mean, the system didn't care.	N
295	00:22:11	00:22:16	Mrs. Frommer, were Toby and your daughter involved romantically?	Y
296	00:22:22	00:22:28	You know those moments you look back on and you wish you'd chosen door number two instead?	N
297	00:22:28	00:22:32	My whole life feels like that.	N
298	00:22:32	00:22:36	I got nothing left.	N
299	00:22:39	00:22:44	To your knowledge, did, um, Jill ever attempt suicide before?	Y
300	00:22:44	00:22:45	No.	N
301	00:22:45	00:22:49	I mean, not that I know of, but with that boy around, there's no telling what he got her into.	N
302	00:22:49	00:22:50	I... I called Social Services.	N
303	00:22:50	00:22:52	I tried to get him out of the house.	N
304	00:22:52	00:22:55	He was on a list, but nobody wants teenagers, you know?	N
305	00:22:55	00:22:56	Just five and under.	N
306	00:22:56	00:22:59	Mrs. Frommer, we believe that Toby and Jill had help.	N
307	00:22:59	00:23:01	We'd like a list of their friends.	N
308	00:23:03	00:23:04	Friends?!	N
309	00:23:06	00:23:12	I think it's pretty clear that my daughter's life was just way out of my hands.	N
310	00:23:16	00:23:19	Blood on the paper towels was the vic's, Lori Hutchins.	N
311	00:23:19	00:23:21	Found DNA on another area, however.	N
312	00:23:21	00:23:23	Epithelials with two donors.	N
313	00:23:23	00:23:24	By who?	N
314	00:23:24	00:23:27	Well, the vic and... someone else.	N
315	00:23:27	00:23:28	Are you being cagey?	N
316	00:23:28	00:23:31	I'm trying to transition out of cagey.	N
317	00:23:31	00:23:33	You got to round up some more swabs.	N
318	00:23:33	00:23:35	Neither Harpo...	N
319	00:23:35	00:23:36	Harper.	N
320	00:23:36	00:23:37	Whatev-o.	N
321	00:23:37	00:23:40	Neither she nor Rhone Confer was a match.	N
322	00:23:44	00:23:45	Yeah?	N
323	00:23:51	00:23:53	I came as soon as I got a call from the USDA.	N
324	00:23:53	00:23:54	What happened?	N
325	00:23:54	00:23:56	Chronic Metritis.	N
326	00:23:56	00:23:57	Uterine infections.	N
327	00:23:57	00:23:59	I opened up the caslicks.	N
328	00:23:59	00:24:03	I tried antibiotics, saline lavage...	N
329	00:24:03	00:24:05	I guess it was too little, too late.	N
330	00:24:10	00:24:14	I found a suture scissors near Lori's body on the plane.	N
331	00:24:14	00:24:19	Is it possible that she knew about the infection and tried to relieve it?	N
332	00:24:19	00:24:23	Well, it'd have to be critical for Lori to try emergency surgery in the air.	N
333	00:24:23	00:24:24	Define critical.	N
334	00:24:24	00:24:26	Massive swelling...	N
335	00:24:26	00:24:29	a threat to High Folly's ability to foal.	N
336	00:24:29	00:24:33	I believe we found our greater tragedy.	N
337	00:24:42	00:24:46	Equine necropsy's a lot like human autopsy.	N
338	00:24:46	00:24:47	One organ at a time.	N
339	00:24:47	00:24:51	Do you know, they're a lot like us, except their constitutions are even more sensitive.	N
340	00:24:51	00:24:54	A horse can die from indigestion.	N
341	00:24:54	00:24:58	A horse is dangerous at both ends, and uncomfortable in the middle.	N
342	00:24:58	00:24:59	Who said that?	N
343	00:25:00	00:25:01	Ian Fleming.	N
344	00:25:01	00:25:03	Ah, James Bond fan, huh?	N
345	00:25:03	00:25:05	I read the novels when I was a kid.	N
346	00:25:05	00:25:11	Well, the vet flushed and dilated her, but her white blood cell count was through the roof.	N
347	00:25:11	00:25:13	You have any idea what caused the infection?	N
348	00:25:13	00:25:15	Hard to tell...	N
349	00:25:15	00:25:22	but the uterus is a highly-balanced environment, and an infection can start with something as simple as a speck of dirt.	N
350	00:25:24	00:25:27	The uterine walls sense a foreign body, and attack it.	N
351	00:25:34	00:25:38	I thought the stitches were used to prevent the invasion of foreign bodies.	N
352	00:25:38	00:25:45	Well, they're supposed to, but she's got so much pyometra in her right uterine horn, something got in there.	N
353	00:25:45	00:25:50	Unless a horse is opened up, you can't actually reach the horns.	N
354	00:26:01	00:26:03	This is outside my purview.	N
355	00:26:34	00:26:36	Uncut diamonds?	N
356	00:26:38	00:26:40	The horse is a mule.	N
357	00:26:42	00:26:43	Jill Frommer?	N
358	00:26:43	00:26:44	Dude, that girl was mental.	N
359	00:26:44	00:26:46	I used to be friends with her in, like, fifth grade.	N
360	00:26:47	00:26:51	Sometimes I'd pick her up before school, and she'd always be waiting outside, like a dork.	N
361	00:26:51	00:26:53	When was the last time you saw Jill?	N
362	00:26:53	00:26:55	Hmm, she hasn't been at school all year.	N
363	00:26:55	00:26:58	I heard she switched schools to be with some guy.	N
364	00:26:59	00:27:01	How lame. Oh, like you wouldn't do it.	N
365	00:27:01	00:27:03	Like, does this dress look familiar?	N
366	00:27:03	00:27:05	Oh, my God.	N
367	00:27:05	00:27:09	That's the dress that Alyssa made and wore to last year's homecoming.	N
368	00:27:09	00:27:10	When she was fat?	N
369	00:27:10	00:27:13	Ladies... who is Alyssa?	N
370	00:27:13	00:27:14	Jamison.	N
371	00:27:14	00:27:15	Aka GTS.	N
372	00:27:15	00:27:17	Goody Two Shoes.	N
373	00:27:17	00:27:19	When she's not out saving the planet, she's healing the sick.	N
374	00:27:19	00:27:21	What?	N
375	00:27:21	00:27:23	She works as a Volunteen at the hospital.	N
376	00:27:33	00:27:35	Hello. How may I help you?	N
377	00:27:35	00:27:38	Hi, there. I'm Sara Sidle, and this is Warrick Brown.	N
378	00:27:38	00:27:39	We're with the Crime Lab.	N
379	00:27:39	00:27:40	Did you know Jill Frommer?	N
380	00:27:41	00:27:42	Sure.	N
381	00:27:42	00:27:46	Did you happen to give her this dress?	N
382	00:27:46	00:27:47	Yes.	N
383	00:27:47	00:27:51	Did you also give her fentanyl and cisapride?	N
384	00:27:51	00:27:53	Oh, my God!	N
385	00:27:53	00:27:54	She...	N
386	00:27:54	00:27:56	killed herself, didn't she?	N
387	00:27:56	00:27:57	Yeah, she did.	N
388	00:27:57	00:28:00	She gave me a necklace.	N
389	00:28:00	00:28:01	Excuse me?	N
390	00:28:01	00:28:04	Giving away sacred possessions.	N
391	00:28:04	00:28:06	That's one of the sure signs of suicide.	N
392	00:28:06	00:28:08	She traded the necklace for my dress.	N
393	00:28:08	00:28:12	I told her she didn't have to, but she kept insisting.	N
394	00:28:13	00:28:17	Said that she had something special to wear the dress to, and the necklace would be collateral.	N
395	00:28:19	00:28:22	I took it as a good sign, because she'd been so depressed lately.	N
396	00:28:22	00:28:26	Did you give her any drugs, or-or give her access to this pharmacy?	N
397	00:28:26	00:28:30	I couldn't, even if I wanted to.	N
398	00:28:30	00:28:32	Not that I ever would.	N
399	00:28:43	00:28:47	According to his receptionist, Dr. Stevens...	N
400	00:28:47	00:28:50	left town...	N
401	00:28:50	00:28:51	unexpectedly.	N
402	00:28:51	00:28:53	Really?	N
403	00:28:53	00:28:54	Well, check this out.	N
404	00:28:57	00:28:59	I don't think it's pixie dust.	N
405	00:29:00	00:29:03	And...	N
406	00:29:03	00:29:06	lots of red lentils.	N
407	00:29:06	00:29:09	Supposedly used to keep the diamonds from chipping.	N
408	00:29:15	00:29:17	That Dr. Stevens was very involved.	N
409	00:29:17	00:29:19	Mmm.	N
410	00:29:23	00:29:29	A horse's uterus is the size of a football, so he could've packed it with pouches of diamonds.	N
411	00:29:29	00:29:31	Why did he leave one behind?	N
412	00:29:31	00:29:33	He took what he could reach.	N
413	00:29:33	00:29:34	And ran.	N
414	00:29:34	00:29:38	But he wasn't on that plane, so he couldn't have killed the girl.	N
415	00:29:38	00:29:39	He had a partner.	N
416	00:30:16	00:30:25	Did you know that the term carat comes from the Mediterranean carob tree, whose seeds were used for centuries as a standard of measurement?	N
417	00:30:25	00:30:28	No. Um...	N
418	00:30:28	00:30:42	so, based on the six-to-one lentil-to-diamond ratio in the packet we found, and assuming that all the packets are the same size, I think we're looking for... five more.	N
419	00:30:42	00:30:44	Five?	N
420	00:30:47	00:30:55	Well, yeah, based on weight, uh, we've established that approximately 183 grams of lentils per pack...	N
421	00:30:55	00:30:57	732 grams would be...	N
422	00:30:59	00:31:02	Oh, my mistake. Four.	N
423	00:31:04	00:31:07	Well, it's not 100% accurate, but, uh...	N
424	00:31:07	00:31:14	based on shape, color characteristics, wavelength absorptions of the regional impurities...	N
425	00:31:14	00:31:18	it says that these diamonds come from Central Africa.	N
426	00:31:18	00:31:21	Conflict diamonds?	N
427	00:31:21	00:31:25	Don't those fund warlords and support child slavery?	N
428	00:31:25	00:31:28	Yeah. Bought for pennies on the dollar, and banned by the UN.	N
429	00:31:28	00:31:33	Well, that would explain why someone felt the need to smuggle them into the country.	N
430	00:31:33	00:31:35	That, and a half a million dollars worth of luxury tax.	N
431	00:31:35	00:31:37	No customs, no tax.	N
432	00:31:37	00:31:42	And if Lori were about to find out, explains why someone would want to kill her.	N
433	00:31:42	00:31:43	So we've got the how and the why.	N
434	00:31:43	00:31:46	We just need the who.	N
435	00:31:52	00:31:55	Well, you travel with a well-heeled crowd.	N
436	00:31:56	00:31:57	I checked everybody's passports.	N
437	00:31:57	00:31:59	Man, you guys get around...	N
438	00:31:59	00:32:02	but you're the only one who's been to Sierra Leone.	N
439	00:32:02	00:32:04	You know why I became a steward?	N
440	00:32:04	00:32:07	I don't know, uh, see the world?	N
441	00:32:07	00:32:08	Exactly.	N
442	00:32:08	00:32:10	What'd you see in Sierra Leone?	N
443	00:32:10	00:32:12	Well, that's the joke.	N
444	00:32:12	00:32:14	Free night in Amsterdam? No, no.	Y
445	00:32:14	00:32:20	I went around the globe picking up packages for the Fitzgeralds like a frickin' bike messenger.	Y
446	00:32:20	00:32:22	Oh, could you take the plane to Rome...	N
447	00:32:22	00:32:24	to Ghana... pick something up for me?	N
448	00:32:25	00:32:26	Sounds like fun.	N
449	00:32:26	00:32:28	What kind of stuff did you pick up?	N
450	00:32:28	00:32:29	Who knows?	N
451	00:32:29	00:32:31	Art, antiques.	N
452	00:32:31	00:32:32	It's usually wrapped up.	N
453	00:32:32	00:32:37	Look, I figure I'm better off not knowing, and it looks like I was right.	N
454	00:32:37	00:32:39	What was your beef with Lori, the horse trainer?	N
455	00:32:39	00:32:42	I don't have one.	N
456	00:32:42	00:32:48	Oh, well, we got a stack of bloody paper towels with your DNA on it that says you do.	N
457	00:32:52	00:32:53	I took them from her.	N
458	00:32:53	00:32:56	Hey, Lori, dinner's ready.	N
459	00:32:56	00:32:57	You okay?	N
460	00:32:57	00:32:59	Yeah, the horse is just really freaked out.	N
461	00:33:00	00:33:00	Gave me a good one.	N
462	00:33:01	00:33:02	Would you mind taking these?	N
463	00:33:02	00:33:03	Sure. No problem.	N
464	00:33:04	00:33:07	I got buzzed into the bedroom.	Y
465	00:33:07	00:33:10	Mrs. Fitzgerald needed help with her zipper.	Y
466	00:33:10	00:33:13	I threw the paper towels in the wastepaper basket.	Y
467	00:33:23	00:33:25	That's a tidy little story.	N
468	00:33:29	00:33:34	You know, Jill's friends seemed like they were brainwashed... or brain-dead.	Y
469	00:33:34	00:33:37	And Moms was absentee at best, huh?	Y
470	00:33:37	00:33:38	Well, teenagers are very suggestive.	N
471	00:33:38	00:33:42	If Toby was the best thing she had going, it's the biggest influence in her life.	N
472	00:33:42	00:33:43	Yeah.	N
473	00:33:43	00:33:45	Don't even bother viewing those surveillance tapes.	N
474	00:33:45	00:33:47	No hospital's dispensed cisapride in three years.	N
475	00:33:47	00:33:48	So that's it?	N
476	00:33:48	00:33:51	The kids just magically got the drugs and offed themselves, end of story?	N
477	00:33:51	00:33:52	Not exactly.	Y
478	00:33:52	00:33:55	The white substance that you pulled from Romeo's blanket and Juliet's dress... Yeah?	Y
479	00:33:56	00:33:58	Denatured milk proteins and mucoid saliva.	N
480	00:34:00	00:34:01	Baby spittle.	N
481	00:34:01	00:34:03	There was a baby out there.	N
482	00:34:03	00:34:05	Not just any baby-- their baby.	N
483	00:34:05	00:34:06	I pulled DNA.	N
484	00:34:06	00:34:09	Two halves make a whole.	N
485	00:34:26	00:34:30	Mom's credit card showed a suit purchase in the young men's department at JC Penney's.	Y
486	00:34:30	00:34:32	Oh, yeah?	Y
487	00:34:32	00:34:36	Looks like Moms is a personal shopper and chauffeur, huh?	Y
488	00:34:36	00:34:37	Guess Moms is busy.	N
489	00:34:38	00:34:40	Too busy to notice a baby, apparently.	N
490	00:34:58	00:35:00	Ma'am, we have a warrant to search the premises.	Y
491	00:35:47	00:35:48	Warrick...	Y
492	00:35:49	00:35:52	Cisapride and fentanyl-- you care to explain this?	Y
493	00:35:52	00:35:54	My husband went through chemo, I told you that.	Y
494	00:35:54	00:35:56	The fentanyl's for my back pain.	N
495	00:35:56	00:35:59	Why didn't you tell us that Jill and Toby had access to these?	Y
496	00:35:59	00:36:01	Jill, I'm going to lie down.	N
497	00:36:01	00:36:03	Go get me those pills for my back.	Y
498	00:36:03	00:36:05	You didn't ask.	N
499	00:36:36	00:36:38	Hi, baby.	N
500	00:36:38	00:36:40	Hi, little baby.	N
501	00:36:43	00:36:45	I'm this baby's only chance.	N
502	00:36:45	00:36:47	Lady, you are out of chances.	N
503	00:36:47	00:36:50	Watching people kill themselves isn't against the law in Nevada.	N
504	00:37:04	00:37:06	So you encouraged them to take the pills.	N
505	00:37:06	00:37:09	How much longer are you two going to ruin my life, huh?	N
506	00:37:09	00:37:10	How much longer?	N
507	00:37:10	00:37:14	You drove them out to Death Valley after their last meal.	N
508	00:37:14	00:37:17	There's nothing like a little positive reinforcement, is there?	N
509	00:37:17	00:37:19	They were beyond saving.	N
510	00:37:23	00:37:26	Wait, Mom, I changed my mind.	N
511	00:37:26	00:37:27	I don't want to die.	N
512	00:37:27	00:37:29	Mom! Mom!	N
513	00:37:29	00:37:31	Please don't leave me!	N
514	00:37:31	00:37:34	I think we can convince a jury that you did more than just watch.	N
515	00:37:34	00:37:37	Not helping a child in danger is a misdemeanor.	N
516	00:37:37	00:37:39	You might as well write me a parking ticket.	N
517	00:37:39	00:37:42	We're going to write you up on murder, and then I'm going to call Child Services.	N
518	00:37:42	00:37:43	Go ahead.	N
519	00:37:43	00:37:46	I am next of kin, and without a record, I'm going to get her back in a second.	N
520	00:37:46	00:37:48	Miss...	N
521	00:37:50	00:37:51	It's okay.	N
522	00:37:51	00:37:52	It's all right. Hi.	N
523	00:37:52	00:37:54	It's all going to be better with Door Number Two.	N
524	00:37:54	00:37:57	That's right.	N
525	00:38:02	00:38:05	You think we even stand a chance?	N
526	00:38:06	00:38:08	No.	N
527	00:38:08	00:38:11	Hi... hey.	N
528	00:38:13	00:38:14	What have you got?	Y
529	00:38:15	00:38:18	We got animal, mineral, and now vegetable.	N
530	00:38:18	00:38:19	What?	N
531	00:38:19	00:38:22	I ran the trace on the remainder of the diamonds.	N
532	00:38:22	00:38:24	Lentils and carrots.	N
533	00:38:24	00:38:25	Carrots on the karats.	Y
534	00:38:26	00:38:27	I'm thinking Lori packed the diamonds.	N
535	00:38:28	00:38:29	After she fed the horse, evidently.	Y
536	00:38:40	00:38:42	( whinnying ) That a girl.	N
537	00:38:42	00:38:44	She was the only one who got close to that horse.	N
538	00:38:44	00:38:47	So Dr. Stevens didn't have one partner, he had two.	N
539	00:38:47	00:38:52	And Lori was the only one who knew there was five packages, which would explain why Stevens left one behind.	N
540	00:38:52	00:38:54	She was a victim, but she wasn't innocent.	Y
541	00:38:56	00:39:02	Okay, so, we've got a dead woman, a dead horse, a runaway vet, and...	Y
542	00:39:02	00:39:06	a couple million dollars worth of uncut diamonds that are unaccounted for.	N
543	00:39:06	00:39:09	Well, diamonds are worthless unless you have a buyer.	Y
544	00:39:09	00:39:13	What if the vet repackaged the diamonds, took them with him.	Y
545	00:39:13	00:39:14	PD traced him to the Caymans.	N
546	00:39:15	00:39:17	But why would he smuggle them into the country only to smuggle them out again?	N
547	00:39:19	00:39:20	Flight steward's story checks out.	N
548	00:39:20	00:39:24	Lori Hutchins had an ante-mortem gash on her right forearm.	Y
549	00:39:24	00:39:25	Ski instructor...	N
550	00:39:25	00:39:28	massuese... geez.	Y
551	00:39:28	00:39:30	Is there anyone not on Harper's payroll?	N
552	00:39:30	00:39:31	Well, you met her.	N
553	00:39:31	00:39:33	Would you be her friend for free?	Y
554	00:39:33	00:39:35	What about Harper?	Y
555	00:39:35	00:39:38	It was her plane, Meredith's horse.	N
556	00:39:38	00:39:39	She didn't care what happened to the horse.	N
557	00:39:40	00:39:42	Yeah, but she's got no reason to smuggle diamonds.	Y
558	00:39:42	00:39:44	Reward's not worth the risk.	Y
559	00:39:50	00:39:51	Rhone Kinsey-Confer.	Y
560	00:39:55	00:40:00	Hey, what if we were thinking about this whole thing a little too globally?	Y
561	00:40:00	00:40:05	I'm going to find out what Rhone's mother's maiden name is.	Y
562	00:40:05	00:40:07	What's his mother got to do with it?	Y
563	00:40:07	00:40:09	She may have sold me my engagement ring.	Y
564	00:40:11	00:40:13	Brass, check out Kinsey Diamonds.	Y
565	00:40:13	00:40:15	Find out if the owner is related to our concierge.	Y
566	00:40:15	00:40:17	Sir, stop what you're doing.	Y
567	00:40:17	00:40:21	Las Vegas Police. We have a search and seizure warrant for any and all diamonds.	Y
568	00:40:21	00:40:23	I bought those diamonds.	N
569	00:40:23	00:40:24	They're mine.	N
570	00:40:24	00:40:25	What are you doing?	N
571	00:40:25	00:40:31	Mrs. Kinsey, did you ever stop and think that maybe your family discount was a little too good to be true?	N
572	00:40:31	00:40:34	Did you really think your son mined those rocks himself?	Y
573	00:40:34	00:40:35	Come on.	Y
574	00:40:35	00:40:36	Think about it.	N
575	00:40:41	00:40:45	Yeah, someone else's plane, someone else's horse.	N
576	00:40:45	00:40:46	What a good plan.	N
577	00:40:46	00:40:48	Except you got caught.	N
578	00:40:48	00:40:54	Why even bother when you had everything you wanted at your disposal?	N
579	00:40:54	00:40:55	Tantalus.	N
580	00:40:55	00:40:59	Stuck in hell, forever staring at the fruit just out of reach.	N
581	00:40:59	00:41:02	Except you couldn't do it without Lori.	N
582	00:41:02	00:41:04	My guess is her death was an accident.	N
583	00:41:04	00:41:07	Did she care more about the horse than she did the diamonds?	N
584	00:41:07	00:41:09	Can't you give her a pill or something?	N
585	00:41:09	00:41:10	I'm taking the diamonds out.	N
586	00:41:10	00:41:11	No, you're not.	N
587	00:41:11	00:41:12	We've come too far to have this fall apart now.	N
588	00:41:12	00:41:14	It's not worth the horse's life.	N
589	00:41:14	00:41:15	Yeah, well, it is to me.	N
590	00:41:16	00:41:17	Prove it.	N
591	00:41:20	00:41:21	Would you mind taking off your shirt?	N
592	00:41:21	00:41:23	I don't want to.	N
593	00:41:23	00:41:27	Well, that's unfortunate, because...	N
594	00:41:27	00:41:31	your tax evasion allows us to expand your warrant.	N
595	00:41:31	00:41:34	And your shirt-- that's just the beginning.	N
596	00:41:39	00:41:40	What are you looking for?	N
597	00:41:40	00:41:42	Evidence of a struggle.	N
598	00:41:44	00:41:45	Oh, and there it is.	N
599	00:41:47	00:41:50	High-powered pneumatic guns don't need to be loaded to leave a mark.	N
600	00:42:10	00:42:11	Freakin' pony lover.	N
601	00:42:11	00:42:15	A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.	N
