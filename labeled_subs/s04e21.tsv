0	00:00:19	00:00:22	I don't wanna go!	N
1	00:00:22	00:00:24	Whoa! Ooh!	N
2	00:00:24	00:00:26	Oh, Mommy.	N
3	00:00:27	00:00:29	We're all going to die.	N
4	00:00:30	00:00:32	Joey, put your seat belt on. NOW.	N
5	00:00:36	00:00:37	Hold on tight, here we go!	N
6	00:01:02	00:01:04	Okay, guys, come on.	N
7	00:01:04	00:01:06	That was so fun.	N
8	00:01:06	00:01:10	All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pharaoh's Fever.	N
9	00:01:10	00:01:12	Buckle up. Get ready to scream.	N
10	00:01:14	00:01:17	That was so awesome.	N
11	00:01:17	00:01:20	Um, we'll ride it in a minute.	N
12	00:01:20	00:01:25	Um, four King Tut burgers, uh, two Nile River ice teas and two milks.	N
13	00:01:25	00:01:28	Milk is nasty. Yeah.	N
14	00:01:58	00:02:02	So, Dr. Thrillseeker, you ever been on this roller coaster?	N
15	00:02:02	00:02:04	Pharaoh's Fever, yeah...	N
16	00:02:05	00:02:08	but my ride ended at the platform.	N
17	00:02:10	00:02:11	What do you know?	N
18	00:02:12	00:02:14	Six dead.	N
19	00:02:14	00:02:20	Park full of eyewitnesses saw the train fly off the tracks. 401B.	N
20	00:02:20	00:02:21	Accident with injury.	N
21	00:02:21	00:02:22	Uh-huh.	N
22	00:02:22	00:02:24	It's also a 418B.	N
23	00:02:24	00:02:27	A runaway?	N
24	00:02:28	00:02:30	A runaway train.	N
25	00:03:08	00:03:09	Hey.	N
26	00:03:09	00:03:10	Sorry we're late.	N
27	00:03:10	00:03:13	There was a news van blocking the entrance.	N
28	00:03:13	00:03:16	This is the first time a roller coaster has derailed in Clark County.	N
29	00:03:16	00:03:20	Huge criminal and civil liabilities issues, so keep it quiet.	N
30	00:03:20	00:03:22	Photograph the scene.	N
31	00:03:22	00:03:24	Bag and tag all the detritus.	N
32	00:03:25	00:03:26	Forklift anything bigger than Greg.	N
33	00:03:26	00:03:32	We're going to put up a tent on the other side of the parking lot for accident reconstruction. Questions?	N
34	00:03:32	00:03:37	Yeah. What's that guy doing so far away from the others?	N
35	00:03:38	00:03:41	Curious, isn't it?	N
36	00:03:41	00:03:46	So, when he asks if anybody has any questions, he's not really asking?	N
37	00:03:46	00:03:54	Well, I don't know much about roller coaster accidents, but in auto collisions, the victims found furthest away from the car usually weren't wearing a seat belt.	N
38	00:03:54	00:03:56	That'd be my bet.	N
39	00:04:01	00:04:04	Okay, let's go to work.	N
40	00:04:04	00:04:05	What should I do?	N
41	00:04:05	00:04:10	Photo-evidence log-- just record everything we collect, okay?	N
42	00:04:25	00:04:28	Couple of mountain bikers called in the body.	N
43	00:04:28	00:04:30	Coroner just arrived.	N
44	00:04:32	00:04:34	Hi, David.	N
45	00:04:34	00:04:36	Hey.	N
46	00:04:37	00:04:38	Tessa Press.	N
47	00:04:38	00:04:41	School I.D. was in her pocket.	N
48	00:04:41	00:04:42	She's 13.	N
49	00:04:42	00:04:45	I hate these cases.	N
50	00:04:45	00:04:50	Now... the body position is inconsistent with her lividity.	N
51	00:04:51	00:04:54	After she died, blood settled to her anterior and lividity fixed.	N
52	00:04:54	00:04:56	So she had been facedown.	N
53	00:04:56	00:04:57	Yeah.	N
54	00:04:58	00:05:00	And someone dumped her face up.	N
55	00:05:00	00:05:02	How long has she been here?	N
56	00:05:02	00:05:06	I'll defer that question to the insects.	N
57	00:05:12	00:05:13	Instar maggots.	N
58	00:05:14	00:05:20	Given the ambient temperature and last night's rain, I'd estimate she's been out here 24 hours.	N
59	00:05:20	00:05:24	Takes that long for blowfly eggs to hatch.	Y
60	00:05:28	00:05:30	tire prints, shoe impressions.	N
61	00:05:30	00:05:32	Let's just hope there's some evidence on her body.	N
62	00:05:32	00:05:37	If you're going to drive all the way out here to dump a body, why not take another ten minutes and bury her?	N
63	00:05:37	00:05:41	Guess it wasn't worth the killer's time.	N
64	00:06:34	00:06:36	So, how long you been operating the roller coaster?	Y
65	00:06:36	00:06:38	Couple of months. I got a promotion.	Y
66	00:06:38	00:06:39	I used to work the merry-go-round.	Y
67	00:06:40	00:06:41	That's a promotion, huh?	N
68	00:06:41	00:06:44	Yeah. Only little kids go on the merry-go-round.	N
69	00:06:44	00:06:48	Oh, I see. So you get to meet girls your own age on Pharaoh's Fever.	N
70	00:06:48	00:06:50	Yeah, something like that.	N
71	00:06:50	00:06:53	What kind of training do you get to be an operator?	N
72	00:06:53	00:06:55	Training? I release the brake.	N
73	00:06:55	00:06:57	I press a button.	N
74	00:06:57	00:06:58	It's green and marked start.	N
75	00:06:58	00:07:00	I get the picture.	Y
76	00:07:00	00:07:01	All right, look, there are six victims.	Y
77	00:07:01	00:07:04	It'd be helpful to know where each of them was sitting.	N
78	00:07:04	00:07:06	Um...	N
79	00:07:06	00:07:08	front bench was a girl.	N
80	00:07:08	00:07:09	She was blond.	N
81	00:07:09	00:07:11	Yeah? Cute.	N
82	00:07:14	00:07:18	Uh, followed by a punk, old folks and some other dude.	N
83	00:07:20	00:07:21	That's only five.	N
84	00:07:21	00:07:24	That's all I remember.	N
85	00:07:26	00:07:28	See yourself scream?	N
86	00:07:28	00:07:30	What's this about? We got a digital camera.	N
87	00:07:30	00:07:31	It's mounted right over there.	N
88	00:07:32	00:07:34	How does that work?	N
89	00:07:34	00:07:35	Camera's on a trigger.	N
90	00:07:35	00:07:40	Train passes by, automatically snaps a picture and stores it in the computer's hard drive.	N
91	00:07:40	00:07:41	The train was airborne.	N
92	00:07:41	00:07:44	Never even got close to the camera.	N
93	00:07:44	00:07:47	I'm still going to want to take that computer.	N
94	00:07:53	00:07:56	I'm the park's chief engineer.	N
95	00:07:56	00:08:00	Been working on coasters since before I was tall enough to ride 'em.	N
96	00:08:00	00:08:03	You responsible for maintaining this roller coaster?	N
97	00:08:03	00:08:04	I keep all the rides up to code.	N
98	00:08:04	00:08:08	You have any idea what would cause this train to go off the track?	N
99	00:08:08	00:08:10	Well, in theory, I didn't think it was possible.	N
100	00:08:10	00:08:12	There's never been an accident like this anywhere.	N
101	00:08:13	00:08:15	So, you're an expert?	N
102	00:08:15	00:08:17	On roller coasters? Hell yeah.	N
103	00:08:17	00:08:21	Ten years of service on Six Flags' American Eagle before moving to Vegas.	N
104	00:08:21	00:08:23	Do you know what that is?	N
105	00:08:23	00:08:27	That's a nut. It, uh... secures the wheel to the screw.	N
106	00:08:27	00:08:29	Well, one loose screw...	N
107	00:08:29	00:08:33	couldn't cause a train to derail, could it?	N
108	00:08:33	00:08:36	No, no, there's, uh... eight wheels per train.	N
109	00:08:36	00:08:38	They-they'd all have to be loose, and, uh...	N
110	00:08:38	00:08:40	that just doesn't happen.	N
111	00:08:52	00:08:55	There are three things in human life that are important.	N
112	00:08:55	00:09:04	The first is to be kind; the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind.	N
113	00:09:04	00:09:05	Henry James.	N
114	00:09:05	00:09:10	Very good. Author of one of the greatest horror stories Turn of the Screw.	N
115	00:09:10	00:09:11	And I'm looking for one.	N
116	00:09:12	00:09:13	A screw? Yes.	N
117	00:09:13	00:09:15	Oh, well...	N
118	00:09:15	00:09:18	technically, these are eccentric shafts, not screws.	N
119	00:09:18	00:09:22	Well, as long as you can screw a nut on it, it's a screw.	N
120	00:09:23	00:09:24	Turn of the Screw isn't really a horror story.	N
121	00:09:25	00:09:26	It's more of a mystery.	N
122	00:09:26	00:09:28	Did the governess kill the little boy, or did the ghost do it?	N
123	00:09:28	00:09:31	Well, it's only a mystery if you believe in ghosts.	N
124	00:09:33	00:09:36	End threads are stripped.	N
125	00:09:36	00:09:37	Means the nuts were loose.	N
126	00:09:37	00:09:40	Excessive play on the screws would've worn down the threads.	N
127	00:09:40	00:09:42	And the nuts would've popped off.	N
128	00:09:47	00:09:50	Nuts don't just pop off by themselves.	Y
129	00:09:53	00:09:55	We got tool marks.	N
130	00:09:55	00:09:59	Vertical striations, evenly spaced.	Y
131	00:09:59	00:10:01	Could've been a pipe wrench.	Y
132	00:10:01	00:10:05	Maybe whoever maintains the roller coaster uses a pipe wrench to tighten the nuts.	N
133	00:10:05	00:10:09	Or whoever loosened the nuts screwed up.	Y
134	00:10:19	00:10:23	It's Tessa.	Y
135	00:10:23	00:10:26	I don't understand.	Y
136	00:10:28	00:10:29	How could this...?	Y
137	00:10:34	00:10:36	My baby.	N
138	00:10:39	00:10:42	I'm very sorry.	Y
139	00:10:43	00:10:46	She's beautiful, isn't she?	Y
140	00:10:48	00:10:54	Ma'am, the coroner believes that Tessa died over 24 hours ago.	Y
141	00:10:54	00:10:56	Had you reported her missing?	N
142	00:10:58	00:11:02	Couple nights a week, she'd sleep at her friend Carrie's.	Y
143	00:11:02	00:11:06	There's just the two of us.	Y
144	00:11:06	00:11:09	I'm a waitress. Work nights.	N
145	00:11:09	00:11:11	That way I can...	N
146	00:11:11	00:11:16	make her breakfast and be there when she gets home from school.	Y
147	00:11:17	00:11:20	When was the last time that you saw her?	Y
148	00:11:20	00:11:22	Yesterday morning.	N
149	00:11:22	00:11:26	00.	N
150	00:11:26	00:11:29	We made pancakes.	Y
151	00:11:30	00:11:33	I packed her lunch and kissed her good-bye.	N
152	00:11:37	00:11:42	When she didn't come home from school, I just figured she was at Carrie's.	Y
153	00:11:45	00:11:51	I should have called, but I didn't want to be a nag.	N
154	00:11:54	00:11:56	I want to see her.	Y
155	00:11:58	00:12:04	Officer, could you please escort Ms. Press... to the morgue.	Y
156	00:12:20	00:12:24	When's the last time you went 24 hours without talking to Lindsey?	N
157	00:12:24	00:12:26	A single mother, working nights.	N
158	00:12:26	00:12:30	I'm just saying, she didn't check on her own kid, you know?	N
159	00:12:30	00:12:34	Ah, you do the best you can.	N
160	00:12:34	00:12:36	Introductions.	N
161	00:12:38	00:12:39	Shelly Hoffman, 25.	N
162	00:12:39	00:12:42	Cause of death-- lacerated ventricle.	N
163	00:12:42	00:12:43	Noah Nuland, 15.	N
164	00:12:44	00:12:46	C.O.D.-- head contusion.	Y
165	00:12:46	00:12:49	The swelling of the brain killed him within minutes.	N
166	00:12:49	00:12:53	Now, Gary Clodfelter died of shock.	N
167	00:12:53	00:12:55	His wife, May, exsanguinated.	N
168	00:12:55	00:13:00	And their son, Cameron-- another head contusion.	N
169	00:13:00	00:13:03	What about this guy?	N
170	00:13:03	00:13:04	Jim Nevins, 20.	N
171	00:13:04	00:13:06	Park employee.	N
172	00:13:06	00:13:09	Died from a temporal herniation.	N
173	00:13:09	00:13:14	Impact to the head caused the brain to swell, which, in turn, put pressure on the brain stem.	N
174	00:13:14	00:13:19	According to the ride operator, there were only five passengers on the roller coaster, and no employees.	N
175	00:13:19	00:13:22	Right. So...	N
176	00:13:22	00:13:25	maybe Nevins was just an unfortunate bystander.	N
177	00:13:25	00:13:28	Hit in the head by a falling roller coaster.	N
178	00:13:28	00:13:30	The Chicken Little theory?	N
179	00:13:30	00:13:31	But here's the hitch.	N
180	00:13:32	00:13:34	The others died roughly ten hours ago.	N
181	00:13:34	00:13:37	Mr. Nevins' rigor mortis is fixed.	N
182	00:13:37	00:13:43	Body temp puts the time of his death approximately 16 hours before the others-- 00 A.M.	N
183	00:13:46	00:13:51	Albert... dead men don't ride roller coasters.	N
184	00:13:56	00:13:59	We're going to need to see the underside of the loading platform.	N
185	00:13:59	00:14:00	Oh, follow me.	N
186	00:14:00	00:14:04	Rumor has it the park's going to shut down Pharaoh's Fever for good.	N
187	00:14:04	00:14:05	You know anything about that?	N
188	00:14:05	00:14:07	No.	N
189	00:14:07	00:14:09	Newspaper called it a death trap.	N
190	00:14:09	00:14:11	An accident waiting to happen.	N
191	00:14:11	00:14:12	You disagree with that?	N
192	00:14:12	00:14:16	Well, she's old and wrinkled, but I took good care of her.	N
193	00:14:20	00:14:21	Uh, Woody?	N
194	00:14:22	00:14:23	We'd like to be alone.	N
195	00:14:25	00:14:26	Holler if you need anything.	N
196	00:14:48	00:14:51	Well, easy access.	N
197	00:14:51	00:14:54	Wheels are in reach.	N
198	00:14:54	00:14:57	Anyone could have loosened the nuts from down here.	N
199	00:14:57	00:15:00	Check this out.	N
200	00:15:00	00:15:02	Is that lubricant, maybe?	N
201	00:15:02	00:15:03	It's a funny place for lubricant.	N
202	00:15:03	00:15:04	It's not even on the track.	N
203	00:15:04	00:15:06	I'll swab it.	N
204	00:15:12	00:15:15	Hey, look at that.	N
205	00:15:17	00:15:19	That's worse than just a wrinkle.	N
206	00:15:19	00:15:21	It's got a support beam under it.	N
207	00:15:21	00:15:22	It's just a cosmetic problem.	N
208	00:15:22	00:15:24	Sir, you need to step away.	N
209	00:15:24	00:15:26	We need some time.	N
210	00:15:26	00:15:29	This is an active investigation.	N
211	00:15:29	00:15:33	Were you aware that that support beam was detached?	N
212	00:15:33	00:15:34	Well, hell, yeah.	N
213	00:15:34	00:15:36	Fixed it a half dozen times this year.	N
214	00:15:36	00:15:37	It's in my maintenance log.	N
215	00:15:37	00:15:41	But like I said, that cross bar is supported by the metal beam.	N
216	00:15:41	00:15:45	But since my hours were cut back last November, I've had to prioritize my fix-ums.	N
217	00:15:45	00:15:47	Hmm.	N
218	00:15:47	00:15:51	Woody, we'd like to requisition your pipe wrench.	N
219	00:15:51	00:15:53	It's, uh, not technically mine.	N
220	00:15:53	00:15:55	Are you the only one that uses it?	N
221	00:15:55	00:15:58	Yeah, but it's the property of the park.	N
222	00:15:58	00:16:00	Well, I promise we'll get it back to you.	N
223	00:16:04	00:16:06	Thank you.	N
224	00:16:07	00:16:09	Yeah?	N
225	00:16:09	00:16:12	I'm processing the dead park employee's clothing.	N
226	00:16:12	00:16:15	The shirt and the pants are covered in red fibers.	N
227	00:16:15	00:16:17	Anything distinctive?	N
228	00:16:17	00:16:21	Well, they're trilobal.	N
229	00:16:21	00:16:22	Very good.	N
230	00:16:22	00:16:23	Thanks, Nick.	N
231	00:16:23	00:16:29	Well, we need to find a car with a red interior.	N
232	00:16:29	00:16:31	Hi.	N
233	00:16:33	00:16:35	The roller coaster broke into 106 parts.	N
234	00:16:35	00:16:37	I just logged the final piece.	N
235	00:16:37	00:16:39	Good work.	N
236	00:16:39	00:16:42	I found something a little unusual, for a roller coaster.	N
237	00:16:47	00:16:50	Not a sailor, but a...	N
238	00:16:50	00:16:52	Semen?	N
239	00:16:52	00:16:53	Sex on the roller coaster?	N
240	00:16:54	00:16:56	Or some kid shaking hands with Shorty.	N
241	00:16:58	00:17:05	The release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a roller coaster can produce a stimulatory effect.	N
242	00:17:05	00:17:07	It enhances ejaculation.	N
243	00:17:07	00:17:10	Right. But is it probative to our investigation?	N
244	00:17:10	00:17:15	Well, um, why don't you swab a sample, and you can tell us.	N
245	00:17:15	00:17:18	Greg, do we know who the R.O. of this T-Bird is?	N
246	00:17:18	00:17:19	Uh...	N
247	00:17:19	00:17:21	Jim Nevins.	N
248	00:17:21	00:17:23	The dead employee.	N
249	00:17:23	00:17:26	I didn't realize the cars were relevant to our investigation.	N
250	00:17:26	00:17:30	Everything's relevant Greg, until it's not.	N
251	00:17:36	00:17:38	Grissom.	N
252	00:17:43	00:17:45	Take a look at this.	N
253	00:17:45	00:17:47	A pipe wrench.	Y
254	00:17:50	00:17:52	Blood.	Y
255	00:17:52	00:17:54	Greg, may I?	Y
256	00:18:01	00:18:04	Blood pool.	Y
257	00:18:04	00:18:07	Camouflaged by the red carpet.	Y
258	00:18:07	00:18:10	That explains the autopsy findings.	N
259	00:18:10	00:18:13	Nevins may have never been in the roller coaster.	Y
260	00:18:13	00:18:17	Possibly killed by that wrench and stuffed in his own trunk.	Y
261	00:18:17	00:18:18	And, uh, then what?	Y
262	00:18:18	00:18:24	A renegade roller coaster comes along 16 hours later, and propels Nevin's body from the trunk to the blacktop?	Y
263	00:18:24	00:18:25	I'm just following the evidence.	N
264	00:18:26	00:18:31	I'll call Brass, see if he can find an eyewitness that can place the car in the parking lot at the time of Nevin's death.	Y
265	00:18:35	00:18:38	Uh, so, Woody said that I might be able to help you with your investigation.	Y
266	00:18:38	00:18:41	Zack, you close up shop at the Sphinx at night.	N
267	00:18:41	00:18:42	Yeah, Monday to Friday.	N
268	00:18:42	00:18:43	00.	N
269	00:18:44	00:18:47	00, and then I head over to the park.	N
270	00:18:47	00:18:48	00.	N
271	00:18:48	00:18:54	Did you notice any cars in the parking lot after closing on Thursday night?	N
272	00:18:54	00:18:57	Jimmy Nevins. His red T-Bird was out there.	N
273	00:18:57	00:18:58	Oh, you know Jimmy?	N
274	00:18:58	00:19:00	Yeah, sure; pretty cool guy.	N
275	00:19:00	00:19:01	Worked the bumper cars.	N
276	00:19:01	00:19:05	I still can't believe what happened, you know?	N
277	00:19:05	00:19:09	I mean, I must have rode that coaster, like, 100 times, maybe more.	N
278	00:19:09	00:19:12	Anyway, sometimes Jimmy stayed after closing.	N
279	00:19:12	00:19:14	Why?	N
280	00:19:14	00:19:21	Look, I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble, but occasionally, Jimmy would take his... dates for rides on The Fever, you know?	N
281	00:19:21	00:19:23	Everybody knew about it. It was really no big deal.	N
282	00:19:23	00:19:26	Do you happen to know the name of his date on Thursday night?	N
283	00:19:26	00:19:28	No, sorry.	N
284	00:19:28	00:19:30	How did Jimmy get access to the park?	N
285	00:19:30	00:19:33	I mean, all the power is shut down at night.	N
286	00:19:33	00:19:37	The same key that opens up the men's room door opens up all the power boxes at the park.	N
287	00:19:37	00:19:38	No kidding.	N
288	00:19:38	00:19:40	It's just hanging outside Woody's office.	N
289	00:19:40	00:19:42	What about security?	N
290	00:19:42	00:19:45	Nope. Night guy got laid off.	N
291	00:19:45	00:19:46	Budget cuts last winter.	N
292	00:19:46	00:19:50	It's not like anybody's going break into an amusement park and steal a coaster, you know?	N
293	00:19:51	00:19:53	X-rayed Tessa's neck.	N
294	00:19:53	00:19:59	Blade appears to have perforated her fifth cervical intervertebral disc, lacerating the spinal cord.	N
295	00:20:01	00:20:06	Type of trauma suggests we're looking at asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis.	N
296	00:20:09	00:20:13	It looks like there's soil inside of her wound.	N
297	00:20:13	00:20:15	Well, we did find her outside.	N
298	00:20:15	00:20:18	Right.	N
299	00:20:18	00:20:21	Should be soil around the wound.	N
300	00:20:21	00:20:25	And on the wound, but not inside of it.	N
301	00:21:37	00:21:39	Oh, I am the man.	N
302	00:21:39	00:21:41	Are you?	N
303	00:21:41	00:21:45	I microsilled the pipe wrenches you and Sara turned into evidence.	N
304	00:21:45	00:21:48	I excluded Woody's wrench.	N
305	00:21:48	00:21:51	Take a look at the tool marks from the wrench found in the T-bird.	N
306	00:21:51	00:21:52	On the left, the sabotaged nut.	N
307	00:21:52	00:21:55	On the right, the test marks.	N
308	00:21:55	00:21:57	Perfect match.	N
309	00:21:57	00:21:58	I have a theory.	N
310	00:21:58	00:22:01	Maybe Jim Nevins sabotaged the roller coaster.	N
311	00:22:06	00:22:11	When he left the park, someone attacked him, grabbed his wrench and hit him over the head with it.	N
312	00:22:18	00:22:19	Did you any prints off the wrench?	N
313	00:22:19	00:22:20	I got a partial.	N
314	00:22:21	00:22:22	And I had a tech print the T-Bird.	N
315	00:22:22	00:22:25	Found two sets of prints on the trunk's lid.	N
316	00:22:25	00:22:30	One belonged to the vic, the other unknown, but it did match the partial.	N
317	00:22:32	00:22:38	That semen from the coaster's cab was just processed in my lab.	N
318	00:22:38	00:22:40	All I can say is, Nevins was a cad.	N
319	00:22:41	00:22:43	Semen match the dead guy's?	N
320	00:22:43	00:22:48	Yup. And Sara spoke to Brass, who says Nevins was known for taking girls on private rides.	N
321	00:22:48	00:22:50	Pharaoh's Fever was his Spanish fly.	N
322	00:22:50	00:22:53	Well, there goes my theory.	N
323	00:22:53	00:22:56	No one tampers with their sex machine.	N
324	00:23:01	00:23:03	Multitrack digital camera snaps photos of all the passengers.	N
325	00:23:03	00:23:07	The park finally sent over their computer, so I'm scanning through the day of the accident.	N
326	00:23:08	00:23:10	Can you go back in time, to the night before?	N
327	00:23:10	00:23:12	Yeah. Why?	N
328	00:23:12	00:23:14	Jim Nevins may have been on that coaster.	N
329	00:23:14	00:23:16	I want to see if anyone was with him.	N
330	00:23:23	00:23:25	Oh. So much for safe sex.	N
331	00:23:25	00:23:27	Who's the girl?	N
332	00:23:27	00:23:28	Reverse one more pic.	N
333	00:23:32	00:23:35	Now, that picture's worth five bucks.	N
334	00:23:35	00:23:39	45 a.m.	N
335	00:23:39	00:23:41	00 a.m.	N
336	00:23:41	00:23:43	We need to find that girl.	N
337	00:23:47	00:23:49	Hey.	N
338	00:23:49	00:23:50	Hey.	N
339	00:23:50	00:23:52	Got your page. What's up?	N
340	00:23:52	00:23:55	Tessa Press took the bus to and from school, not far from here. Mm-hmm.	N
341	00:23:56	00:23:57	I showed her picture to the mini-mart manager.	N
342	00:23:58	00:24:00	She remembers seeing her the day that she was killed.	N
343	00:24:00	00:24:02	Wow.	N
344	00:24:02	00:24:04	This place is crawling with kids.	N
345	00:24:04	00:24:05	She remembers her?	N
346	00:24:05	00:24:09	She says she came in every afternoon and bought a Little Debbie and a soda.	N
347	00:24:09	00:24:11	Have we tracked down her friend, Carrie?	N
348	00:24:11	00:24:18	Officer Ray did speak with Carrie and her parents, and they confirmed that Tessa spent at least two nights a week over their place.	N
349	00:24:18	00:24:20	And was she supposed to sleep over the day that she was killed?	N
350	00:24:20	00:24:21	I don't think they had any kind of a schedule.	N
351	00:24:22	00:24:25	She would just show up, and when she didn't, they'd assumed that she was at home.	N
352	00:24:26	00:24:27	Warrick.	N
353	00:24:27	00:24:29	I've already secured the footage.	N
354	00:24:43	00:24:46	00.	N
355	00:24:47	00:24:49	I heard you were looking for someone.	N
356	00:24:49	00:24:51	Sir, do you recognize this young woman?	N
357	00:24:53	00:24:55	Oh, sure, it's Cleopatra.	N
358	00:24:56	00:24:57	She works in food services.	N
359	00:24:57	00:24:59	Second pyramid on the left.	N
360	00:24:59	00:25:01	Thank you, Woody.	N
361	00:25:10	00:25:11	Hey, can I help you?	N
362	00:25:11	00:25:13	Actually, we're looking for Cleopatra.	N
363	00:25:13	00:25:14	She's on break.	N
364	00:25:14	00:25:16	But can I get you anything?	N
365	00:25:17	00:25:19	No, thanks.	N
366	00:25:24	00:25:26	Quadratic equations?	N
367	00:25:26	00:25:29	That's not easy.	N
368	00:25:29	00:25:31	Glad you think so.	N
369	00:25:31	00:25:32	I have a D average.	N
370	00:25:32	00:25:35	If I fail the final, my family's going to Hawaii without me.	N
371	00:25:35	00:25:36	We're with the crime lab.	N
372	00:25:40	00:25:42	We have some questions.	N
373	00:25:45	00:25:49	I had no idea those cameras worked at night.	N
374	00:25:49	00:25:51	Is your name really Cleopatra?	N
375	00:25:51	00:25:53	Lisa. Lisa Hunt.	N
376	00:25:53	00:25:57	Lisa, you know your friend in this photograph is dead, right?	N
377	00:25:57	00:26:00	Right.	N
378	00:26:00	00:26:02	You don't seem too upset about that.	N
379	00:26:04	00:26:09	Four years ago, when I was a frosh and he was a senior, he was my Jordan Catalano.	N
380	00:26:09	00:26:11	Know what I mean?	N
381	00:26:11	00:26:13	But he didn't know my name.	N
382	00:26:13	00:26:24	So four years later, when I started working here, he's still working here-- total loser, but still really hot-- When and where?	N
383	00:26:24	00:26:26	After hours at the roller coaster.	N
384	00:26:26	00:26:30	I know, I thought the same thing-- Cheez Whiz.	N
385	00:26:30	00:26:32	But, I mean, what the hell?	N
386	00:26:32	00:26:34	I'd never done it on a roller coaster.	N
387	00:26:35	00:26:36	It was your first date.	N
388	00:26:37	00:26:39	You sound like my mother.	N
389	00:26:39	00:26:42	Oh, God, you're not going to tell her, are you?	N
390	00:26:42	00:26:43	I just turned 18.	N
391	00:26:43	00:26:45	There is nothing statutory about it, I swear.	N
392	00:26:45	00:26:50	Lisa, we need to know what the two of you did when you got off the ride.	N
393	00:26:50	00:26:51	We talked.	N
394	00:26:51	00:26:54	I mean, not that he had much to say.	N
395	00:26:55	00:27:01	He offered to drive me home, but I only live a few blocks from here, so I told him I'd huff it.	N
396	00:27:01	00:27:04	Mm, we kissed-- way too much slobber.	N
397	00:27:04	00:27:06	And that was it.	N
398	00:27:06	00:27:08	Was there anyone else around?	N
399	00:27:08	00:27:11	I-I didn't see anybody, but I wasn't really looking.	N
400	00:27:19	00:27:22	I found Tessa.	N
401	00:27:22	00:27:24	Yeah, you're not the only one.	N
402	00:27:24	00:27:25	Yeah.	N
403	00:27:25	00:27:27	Can you enlarge it?	N
404	00:27:37	00:27:39	Yeah, that's me.	N
405	00:27:39	00:27:40	And who's that with you?	N
406	00:27:40	00:27:41	Tessa Press.	N
407	00:27:41	00:27:43	You two were friends?	N
408	00:27:43	00:27:45	We sat next to each other on the bus.	N
409	00:27:45	00:27:47	She was 13.	N
410	00:27:47	00:27:48	How old are you?	N
411	00:27:48	00:27:49	What's that supposed to mean?	N
412	00:27:49	00:27:52	No, Mom, it's okay.	N
413	00:27:52	00:27:54	I-I'm 15.	N
414	00:27:54	00:27:56	I felt sorry for her.	N
415	00:27:56	00:27:57	The girls picked on her.	N
416	00:27:57	00:27:59	Made fun of her frizzy hair, her old clothes.	N
417	00:27:59	00:28:00	Stuff like that.	N
418	00:28:01	00:28:05	She'd sit next to me, and they'd leave her alone.	N
419	00:28:05	00:28:07	In the photo, you're grabbing her arm.	N
420	00:28:07	00:28:08	It wasn't like that.	N
421	00:28:08	00:28:10	I just got my learner's permit.	N
422	00:28:10	00:28:12	My mom was waiting in the car.	N
423	00:28:12	00:28:14	We were just going to get slushies.	N
424	00:28:14	00:28:16	I saw Tessa in the parking lot.	N
425	00:28:16	00:28:17	Hey, Tessa. Hey.	N
426	00:28:17	00:28:18	Henry.	N
427	00:28:18	00:28:20	You want a ride, just door to door?	N
428	00:28:20	00:28:22	No, that's okay.	N
429	00:28:22	00:28:24	Oh, come on. You're not scared to drive with me, are you?	N
430	00:28:24	00:28:27	No, it's okay. I got it.	N
431	00:28:27	00:28:29	She said she was getting a ride from someone else.	N
432	00:28:29	00:28:31	Did she say who?	N
433	00:28:32	00:28:33	No.	N
434	00:28:33	00:28:37	But when we pulled away, I saw her getting into a truck.	N
435	00:28:37	00:28:39	I didn't see the driver.	N
436	00:28:44	00:28:46	I've got a question for you.	N
437	00:28:50	00:28:58	Sorbitol, cetyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, glyceryl, stearate, PEG-100 stearate, petrolatum, benzylalcohol, titanium dioxide and purified water?	Y
438	00:28:58	00:29:03	Okay, I assume that you've identified the substance we found on the roller coaster track?	N
439	00:29:03	00:29:04	Correct.	N
440	00:29:05	00:29:07	It's doxepin ointment.	N
441	00:29:07	00:29:09	Sounds Klingon, huh?	N
442	00:29:11	00:29:19	Anyway, uh, it's prescribed by doctors to treat dermatological inflammations caused by contact with certain types of plants.	Y
443	00:29:19	00:29:23	Maybe whoever messed with the tracks transferred the ointment when they loosened the wheels.	N
444	00:29:26	00:29:28	Your killer has a rash.	N
445	00:29:28	00:29:31	And we need to catch it.	Y
446	00:29:35	00:29:37	I've been looking for you.	N
447	00:29:37	00:29:38	What's up?	Y
448	00:29:38	00:29:41	Hodges analyzed the trace from inside Tessa's wound.	Y
449	00:29:41	00:29:43	It seems it was ZooDoo.	N
450	00:29:43	00:29:44	Come again.	N
451	00:29:44	00:29:45	Hoof stock.	N
452	00:29:46	00:29:48	It's a combination of feces from rhinos, zebras, and bison.	N
453	00:29:48	00:29:50	You're kidding?	N
454	00:29:50	00:29:53	They say that the smell of wild animal crap keeps the deer away.	Y
455	00:29:53	00:29:55	Who knew?	Y
456	00:29:55	00:29:57	Uh, so can we track the source of...?	Y
457	00:29:58	00:30:01	There is a zoo in Auckland that exports it.	N
458	00:30:01	00:30:05	And there's only one landscaping company in Clark County that imports it-- ADL.	N
459	00:30:05	00:30:07	I contacted ADL, and guess what they told me?	Y
460	00:30:07	00:30:12	Couple of months back, they were hired by the victim's mother.	N
461	00:30:20	00:30:21	Hmm.	N
462	00:30:21	00:30:22	ADL Landscaping.	Y
463	00:30:24	00:30:29	Must've been a big job-- she hired them months ago.	Y
464	00:30:31	00:30:33	ZooDoo.	N
465	00:30:41	00:30:43	Hello.	N
466	00:30:43	00:30:44	Hi.	N
467	00:30:45	00:30:46	I just left you a message.	N
468	00:30:46	00:30:48	Any news?	Y
469	00:30:50	00:30:53	Honey, these guys are from the crime lab.	N
470	00:30:53	00:30:54	Justin Mack, my boyfriend.	N
471	00:30:55	00:30:57	How you doing?	Y
472	00:30:57	00:30:58	Hey.	Y
473	00:30:58	00:31:00	Could I have a word with you outside for a moment?	N
474	00:31:00	00:31:01	Why?	N
475	00:31:01	00:31:02	Why not?	N
476	00:31:10	00:31:13	May I?	Y
477	00:31:13	00:31:17	How can you be sure it was Justin's truck?	Y
478	00:31:17	00:31:20	At this point, we're just following a lead.	N
479	00:31:20	00:31:24	How long have you known Justin?	N
480	00:31:24	00:31:28	Uh... few months.	N
481	00:31:29	00:31:31	Hired him to lay sod.	N
482	00:31:31	00:31:34	Now we're in the midst of an outdoor overhaul.	N
483	00:31:34	00:31:37	And where's Tessa's father?	N
484	00:31:37	00:31:38	L.A., maybe. I don't know.	N
485	00:31:39	00:31:41	I haven't heard from him since the divorce.	N
486	00:31:42	00:31:44	He'll find a way to blame me for this.	N
487	00:31:45	00:31:48	You see, Raina said it was important for Tessa to take the bus to school.	N
488	00:31:48	00:31:50	Said it helps build independence.	N
489	00:31:50	00:31:56	But sometimes I'd pick her up at the bus stop, buy her an ice-cream cone, and drop her off here.	Y
490	00:31:56	00:31:58	Did you pick her up that afternoon?	N
491	00:31:58	00:32:03	Look, I know there are a lot of whack-jobs in the world, and you're just doing your job, but watch it.	Y
492	00:32:04	00:32:06	You mind if I take a look in the back of your truck?	Y
493	00:32:07	00:32:10	Don't you need a warrant?	Y
494	00:32:10	00:32:12	Only if you deny me access.	Y
495	00:32:12	00:32:13	Go ahead.	N
496	00:32:13	00:32:15	Thanks.	N
497	00:32:15	00:32:18	Have you ever left Tessa alone with Justin?	N
498	00:32:18	00:32:19	Sure.	N
499	00:32:19	00:32:20	He's over here all the time.	N
500	00:32:21	00:32:24	He's a good man.	Y
501	00:32:24	00:32:28	He wouldn't hurt anybody, especially not Tessa.	Y
502	00:32:30	00:32:35	Damn, I keep expecting her to walk through that door.	N
503	00:33:09	00:33:14	In 1988, your client was arrested for a drunk and disorderly.	Y
504	00:33:14	00:33:17	Your fingerprints were then entered into our database.	Y
505	00:33:17	00:33:20	They match the fingerprints that we found on this shovel.	Y
506	00:33:22	00:33:29	The blood on the blade matches your daughter's DNA.	Y
507	00:33:29	00:33:32	My client is landscaping her backyard with her boyfriend.	N
508	00:33:33	00:33:35	Explains her prints on his shovel.	Y
509	00:33:35	00:33:38	They were the only prints on the shovel.	Y
510	00:33:38	00:33:40	Justin wears work gloves.	N
511	00:33:40	00:33:43	Which explains the absence of his prints.	N
512	00:33:43	00:33:45	That's possible.	Y
513	00:33:45	00:33:49	But your client's fingerprints provided a sufficient basis for a warrant to search her vehicle.	Y
514	00:34:00	00:34:10	The choice of weapon and the manner of disposal suggest that this was not a premeditated murder.	Y
515	00:34:14	00:34:16	You can help yourself here.	N
516	00:34:16	00:34:20	You can avoid Murder One by telling us what set you off.	N
517	00:34:22	00:34:24	You wouldn't understand.	N
518	00:34:24	00:34:26	Try me.	N
519	00:34:26	00:34:36	I bought Tessa a bus pass, and that little slut still gets my guy to pick her up after school.	N
520	00:34:36	00:34:38	Raina... Shut up!	N
521	00:34:40	00:34:41	We all know why.	Y
522	00:34:41	00:34:43	Why don't you tell us?	Y
523	00:34:43	00:34:46	She was trying to steal him from me.	N
524	00:34:52	00:34:55	Bye, thanks Justin.	N
525	00:34:57	00:35:00	What the hell were you doing with him?	N
526	00:35:00	00:35:02	Mom, he just gave me a ride home.	N
527	00:35:02	00:35:04	You think you got him wrapped around your little finger?	N
528	00:35:04	00:35:05	He's just being nice, okay?	N
529	00:35:05	00:35:07	Were you nice back?	N
530	00:35:07	00:35:09	Don't do this again, please!	N
531	00:35:09	00:35:11	You don't talk to me like that, you little bitch.	N
532	00:35:11	00:35:13	Mom, you're being ridiculous.	N
533	00:35:13	00:35:19	Where the hell do you think you're going? I've given you everything.	N
534	00:35:23	00:35:26	Justin was the best thing in my life.	N
535	00:35:27	00:35:29	No.	Y
536	00:35:29	00:35:35	Your daughter was the best thing in your life.	Y
537	00:35:37	00:35:39	You didn't know her.	Y
538	00:35:42	00:35:44	I know she was 13 years old.	Y
539	00:35:44	00:35:47	A child.	Y
540	00:35:52	00:35:55	I just got the court order from the pharmaceutical database.	Y
541	00:35:55	00:35:57	Fortunately, Dioxipin isn't widely prescribed.	N
542	00:35:57	00:36:02	FDA only approved it two years ago, and most dermatologists don't even know what it is.	Y
543	00:36:02	00:36:04	How many names on the list?	Y
544	00:36:04	00:36:07	Well, in Clark County, twelve prescriptions were filled.	Y
545	00:36:07	00:36:11	I cross-referenced them with the employees from the Park, and I got a hit.	Y
546	00:36:11	00:36:12	You want a clue?	Y
547	00:36:12	00:36:18	Her death ended the Ptolemy dynasty's reign in Ancient Egypt, hence making her the last Pharaoh.	Y
548	00:36:18	00:36:21	Ah, the lovely Cleopatra.	N
549	00:36:21	00:36:22	I had a rash.	N
550	00:36:22	00:36:24	So what?	N
551	00:36:24	00:36:25	That's not a crime.	N
552	00:36:25	00:36:26	I read the court order.	N
553	00:36:26	00:36:30	Uh, you found trace amounts of some ointment on the roller coaster tracks?	N
554	00:36:30	00:36:32	Is that the only reason for this conversation?	N
555	00:36:32	00:36:35	Your client had a prescription for doxepin.	N
556	00:36:38	00:36:40	May we see your arms, please?	Y
557	00:36:40	00:36:41	Rash was on my legs.	N
558	00:36:41	00:36:43	Went away days ago.	N
559	00:36:43	00:36:44	You want to see?	N
560	00:36:45	00:36:46	Uh, that's okay.	N
561	00:36:46	00:36:51	Unless you want to argue that my client stood on her head and held a wrench in her toes, we're done here.	Y
562	00:36:51	00:36:53	Do you know how you contracted the rash, Lisa?	N
563	00:36:53	00:36:57	Best guess, I was getting some help with my homework.	Y
564	00:36:57	00:36:59	We were studying outside on the grass.	N
565	00:36:59	00:37:01	Took a break, went for a walk.	Y
566	00:37:01	00:37:03	I think I brushed up against something.	Y
567	00:37:03	00:37:05	Who's we?	Y
568	00:37:05	00:37:06	My math tutor.	N
569	00:37:06	00:37:08	And what's his name?	N
570	00:37:08	00:37:10	Zack Lawrence.	N
571	00:37:14	00:37:16	Do you know if he contracted the rash, as well?	Y
572	00:37:16	00:37:19	Yeah. Actually, I gave him some of my ointment.	Y
573	00:37:23	00:37:25	Hey, Zack.	N
574	00:37:25	00:37:28	Oh, hey, guys.	Y
575	00:37:28	00:37:29	We spoke with Lisa.	N
576	00:37:29	00:37:33	She said she gave you some ointment for some nasty rash you have.	N
577	00:37:33	00:37:36	You know, it's illegal to use someone else's prescription medications.	Y
578	00:37:36	00:37:38	Is that why you guys are here?	Y
579	00:37:38	00:37:40	Not exactly.	N
580	00:37:42	00:37:44	Um, you guys mind if we talk about this somewhere else?	Y
581	00:37:45	00:37:45	Hey, good idea.	N
582	00:37:46	00:37:47	Why don't we go downtown?	Y
583	00:37:47	00:37:48	We can talk there.	Y
584	00:37:48	00:37:50	Come on. Come on.	N
585	00:37:50	00:37:52	All right.	N
586	00:37:52	00:37:54	You coming?	Y
587	00:37:54	00:37:57	You know, I'm going to catch up.	N
588	00:37:57	00:37:58	Okay.	N
589	00:38:24	00:38:27	Yeah, it's, uh, just a little bit of a rash.	Y
590	00:38:27	00:38:29	It's really no big deal.	N
591	00:38:29	00:38:31	Zack, what do you have against roller coasters?	Y
592	00:38:31	00:38:32	What do...?	N
593	00:38:32	00:38:34	I-I don't understand.	Y
594	00:38:34	00:38:36	This a fingerprint analysis.	Y
595	00:38:36	00:38:40	Zack, I lifted some fingerprints off your broom back at the Park.	Y
596	00:38:40	00:38:45	Turns out, they're a match to prints that we lifted off of Jim Nevins' T-Bird and the wrench that was used to kill him.	Y
597	00:38:45	00:38:47	Circumstantial evidence at best.	Y
598	00:38:47	00:38:49	I also talked to your school principal.	Y
599	00:38:49	00:38:51	You're a straight A student, Mathalete.	Y
600	00:38:51	00:38:52	Science Team.	N
601	00:38:52	00:38:54	You had a full ride to Stanford next year.	N
602	00:38:54	00:38:59	You don't sound like the kind of kid that would mess with a roller coaster just for kicks.	N
603	00:39:01	00:39:02	You're a smart guy, Zack.	Y
604	00:39:02	00:39:04	So, uh...	N
605	00:39:04	00:39:08	let's talk this out, logically.	N
606	00:39:08	00:39:17	According to your previous statement, when you locked up on Thursday night, Jim Nevins' car was the only one in the parking lot, right?	Y
607	00:39:17	00:39:19	Yes, sir, that's correct.	Y
608	00:39:19	00:39:22	And you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster.	N
609	00:39:22	00:39:25	I don't care about Jim Nevins.	Y
610	00:39:25	00:39:28	What about Lisa Hunt?	N
611	00:39:28	00:39:31	You tutor her, right?	N
612	00:39:31	00:39:33	Did Lisa tell you that she had a date with Jim?	N
613	00:39:33	00:39:35	No, she didn't say anything.	N
614	00:39:35	00:39:37	It was all over the park.	Y
615	00:39:37	00:39:41	Jim was going to take Lisa on one of his coaster dates.	N
616	00:39:42	00:39:43	I asked her about it.	Y
617	00:39:44	00:39:45	She said it was a rumor.	N
618	00:39:45	00:39:49	It seems to matter to you that she had a date with Jim.	Y
619	00:39:49	00:39:53	Lady, I make $20 an hour tutoring.	Y
620	00:39:53	00:39:56	Why do you think I'd take minimum wage at The Sphinx?	N
621	00:39:56	00:40:00	I'm thinking, you want Lisa to see you away from the textbooks.	N
622	00:40:01	00:40:03	We started hanging out at breaks.	N
623	00:40:03	00:40:05	Having dinner.	N
624	00:40:07	00:40:10	And then last week, after tutoring, we went for a walk.	N
625	00:40:10	00:40:13	And she grabbed my hand.	N
626	00:40:13	00:40:16	Did you think that meant something?	N
627	00:40:16	00:40:18	Of course.	N
628	00:40:18	00:40:20	But...	N
629	00:40:20	00:40:23	you didn't trust her.	N
630	00:40:24	00:40:26	No. I wanted to.	N
631	00:40:39	00:40:41	You tampered with the screws.	N
632	00:40:41	00:40:44	If she wasn't lying, she wouldn't be on the roller coaster.	N
633	00:40:44	00:40:45	No harm, no foul.	N
634	00:40:45	00:40:48	Oh, but you see, she was lying.	N
635	00:40:48	00:40:49	Uh-huh.	N
636	00:40:51	00:40:53	But you didn't loosen the wheels enough, did you?	N
637	00:40:53	00:40:55	Don't answer that.	N
638	00:40:55	00:41:02	So when the roller coaster didn't derail, you took things into your own hands.	N
639	00:41:12	00:41:14	Lisa walked home.	N
640	00:41:14	00:41:16	Jim walked over to his car.	N
641	00:41:22	00:41:26	What I don't understand is why you didn't go back and fix the roller coaster.	N
642	00:41:28	00:41:30	Guess I just didn't think about it.	N
643	00:41:30	00:41:32	You'll be thinking about it now.	N
644	00:41:33	00:41:35	And for the rest of your life.	N
645	00:41:41	00:41:44	I should have caught those loose screws.	N
646	00:41:44	00:41:48	Used to check 'em every morning, but since management cut back on my hours...	N
647	00:41:48	00:41:50	You're not to blame for this, Woody.	N
648	00:41:50	00:41:53	Oh, I just hope they don't blame the coaster.	N
649	00:41:53	00:41:58	It may not be the Manhattan Express at New York, New York or the Desperado in Primm, but it-it...	N
650	00:41:58	00:42:00	It still makes grown men scream.	N
651	00:42:00	00:42:03	My first week in Vegas, I road the Desperado.	N
652	00:42:03	00:42:05	My first coaster marathon.	N
653	00:42:05	00:42:07	I rode that monster for a week straight.	N
654	00:42:07	00:42:08	Hmm.	N
655	00:42:08	00:42:12	The Steel Phantom, Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania-- I actually hold the marathon record there.	N
656	00:42:12	00:42:14	Uh, uh.	N
657	00:42:14	00:42:17	My-My favorite's still the, um, King's Island.	N
658	00:42:17	00:42:18	The Beast.	N
659	00:42:18	00:42:19	Mm.	N
660	00:42:19	00:42:24	I presented a paper at an Entomology convention in Cincinnati just so I could ride Son of Beast.	N
661	00:42:24	00:42:26	Head over heels on a wooden track.	N
662	00:42:26	00:42:29	Ah. So, you prefer wood over steel?	N
663	00:42:29	00:42:32	No. Not really.	N
664	00:42:32	00:42:34	For me, it's not about the track.	N
665	00:42:34	00:42:37	It's about the thrill.	N
