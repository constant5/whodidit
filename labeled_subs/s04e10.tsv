0	0	0	00:00:41	00:00:43	Boss!	N
1	1	1	00:00:43	00:00:46	We-We got a problem.	N
2	2	2	00:01:15	00:01:18	Well, clean surfaces make for good analysis.	N
3	3	3	00:01:18	00:01:20	Yeah.	N
4	4	4	00:01:20	00:01:22	Well, that may be the only good thing.	N
5	5	5	00:01:22	00:01:25	I checked for a wallet, no ID.	N
6	6	6	00:01:25	00:01:27	Nothing on him.	N
7	7	7	00:01:27	00:01:30	The kid looks like a minor.	N
8	8	8	00:01:30	00:01:33	Coroner's investigator says he's been dead for over 12 hours.	N
9	9	9	00:01:33	00:01:35	Happened sometime this weekend.	N
10	10	10	00:01:43	00:01:46	You going to pry that piece of cloth from his hand?	N
11	11	11	00:01:46	00:01:48	Not just yet.	N
12	12	12	00:01:48	00:01:49	Help me out here.	N
13	13	13	00:01:49	00:01:51	Got any ideas on this one?	N
14	14	14	00:01:53	00:02:01	Well, based on his pants around the knees, I would say a crime of passion.	N
15	15	15	00:02:03	00:02:05	Given the brutality of it...	N
16	16	16	00:02:08	00:02:11	seems to me an act of rage.	N
17	17	17	00:02:43	00:02:47	You know, I lose an hour a day cleaning up their beer bottles and their cigarette butts.	N
18	18	18	00:02:48	00:02:49	Kids use it as a hangout, huh?	N
19	19	19	00:02:49	00:02:52	Oh, sure. They think the house doesn't have a lock, it belongs to them.	N
20	20	20	00:02:52	00:02:56	Well, it's a crime scene, so it belongs to us now.	N
21	21	21	00:02:56	00:02:57	Yeah. How long?	N
22	22	22	00:02:57	00:02:59	As long as it takes.	N
23	23	23	00:02:59	00:03:03	You know, I got two teenagers at home, and they know how to respect other people's property.	N
24	24	24	00:03:03	00:03:06	Now, who's going to feed them when I don't get paid for today, huh?	N
25	25	25	00:03:06	00:03:07	Huh?	N
26	26	26	00:03:07	00:03:08	I can't tell you that.	N
27	27	27	00:03:16	00:03:19	Take a look at his head, tell me what you see.	N
28	28	28	00:03:25	00:03:29	Definitely blunt force.	N
29	29	29	00:03:29	00:03:30	That's a hammerhead.	N
30	30	30	00:03:30	00:03:34	I thought you might say that.	N
31	31	31	00:03:35	00:03:41	Well, we know that people often commit crimes in places they're familiar with.	N
32	32	32	00:03:52	00:03:55	You got to be kidding me.	N
33	33	33	00:04:02	00:04:04	I'll swab the blood and see if it's all his.	N
34	34	34	00:04:16	00:04:17	Grissom?	N
35	35	35	00:04:22	00:04:25	Well, that should help.	N
36	36	36	00:04:27	00:04:30	I'll trade you a hammer for a screw.	N
37	37	37	00:04:30	00:04:32	Name, please.	N
38	38	38	00:04:32	00:04:33	I'll tell you mine, you tell me yours.	N
39	39	39	00:04:34	00:04:36	Oh, come on, baby.	N
40	40	40	00:04:36	00:04:38	I'm stuck with these ugly fools all day.	N
41	41	41	00:04:38	00:04:40	A pretty girl comes by. Just having a little fun.	N
42	42	42	00:04:40	00:04:43	Yeah, murder always makes me feel a little randy, too.	N
43	43	43	00:04:43	00:04:44	Ooh.	N
44	44	44	00:04:55	00:04:56	Fellows.	N
45	45	45	00:04:56	00:05:00	Hey, uh, Mrs. Marlene Mitchell, 32.	N
46	46	46	00:05:00	00:05:03	Apparent gunshot wound to the chest.	N
47	47	47	00:05:03	00:05:05	Entry, no exit.	N
48	48	48	00:05:05	00:05:07	No other apparent injuries.	N
49	49	49	00:05:08	00:05:09	Do we know who shot her?	N
50	50	50	00:05:10	00:05:11	I patted down all her friends.	N
51	51	51	00:05:11	00:05:12	Nobody's carrying.	N
52	52	52	00:05:12	00:05:15	Got a couple officers scanning the neighborhood in case the, uh, weapon got tossed.	N
53	53	53	00:05:15	00:05:18	She was breaking up a fight when she went down.	N
54	54	54	00:05:18	00:05:20	Nobody saw anything? Nobody heard anything?	N
55	55	55	00:05:20	00:05:21	No.	N
56	56	56	00:05:21	00:05:22	Somebody's lying.	N
57	57	57	00:05:24	00:05:25	That the husband?	N
58	58	58	00:05:25	00:05:26	The current one.	N
59	59	59	00:05:27	00:05:29	The other one-- he's the ex.	N
60	60	60	00:05:31	00:05:32	Interesting family reunion.	N
61	61	61	00:05:32	00:05:34	Whose brilliant idea was that?	N
62	62	62	00:05:34	00:05:36	The Mitchells were moving in.	N
63	63	63	00:05:36	00:05:37	The ex stopped by to say hi.	N
64	64	64	00:05:38	00:05:40	Don't you hate it when hello leads to gunfire?	N
65	65	65	00:05:41	00:05:43	I'll need to GSR both.	N
66	66	66	00:05:44	00:05:46	Sir?	N
67	67	67	00:05:46	00:05:49	I'm going to need to test your hands for GSR.	N
68	68	68	00:05:49	00:05:50	What's that?	N
69	69	69	00:05:51	00:05:53	Gunshot residue.	N
70	70	70	00:05:53	00:05:54	Why?	N
71	71	71	00:05:54	00:05:55	To rule you out.	N
72	72	72	00:05:55	00:06:00	You think I shot my wife the day after our honeymoon.	N
73	73	73	00:06:02	00:06:04	We were just moving our stuff.	N
74	74	74	00:06:04	00:06:06	Her ex, Todd, shows up.	N
75	75	75	00:06:06	00:06:10	He knows he's not supposed to come within 100 yards of her.	N
76	76	76	00:06:11	00:06:13	But he did.	N
77	77	77	00:06:14	00:06:16	Please?	N
78	78	78	00:06:16	00:06:17	Marlene?	N
79	79	79	00:06:17	00:06:18	Call 911.	N
80	80	80	00:06:20	00:06:23	I thought it was a heart attack.	N
81	81	81	00:06:25	00:06:27	Then I saw the blood.	N
82	82	82	00:06:28	00:06:29	Yes, but there was a restraining order against you.	N
83	83	83	00:06:29	00:06:30	Why were you here?	N
84	84	84	00:06:31	00:06:33	Thank you.	N
85	85	85	00:06:40	00:06:42	Distinguish!	N
86	86	86	00:06:42	00:06:44	You ready to run?	N
87	87	87	00:06:44	00:06:46	She does all my running.	N
88	88	88	00:06:46	00:06:48	Thanks. Trail!	N
89	89	89	00:07:12	00:07:14	It's a hell of a place to get lost.	N
90	90	90	00:07:14	00:07:16	Yeah. We have five million olfactory sensory receptors.	N
91	91	91	00:07:17	00:07:18	Penny's got 220 million.	N
92	92	92	00:07:18	00:07:20	She sees the world differently.	N
93	93	93	00:07:41	00:07:44	The suspect stopped here.	N
94	94	94	00:07:56	00:07:57	Trail is still strong here.	N
95	95	95	00:08:05	00:08:07	She's got a hit on the Dumpster.	N
96	96	96	00:08:17	00:08:21	She's getting nothing, but Penny will pick up on anything they touched.	N
97	97	97	00:08:28	00:08:30	There's something in the silver bag.	N
98	98	98	00:08:36	00:08:38	What do you think?	N
99	99	99	00:08:38	00:08:40	Bought new clothes, ditched the old ones?	N
100	100	100	00:08:40	00:08:44	What's missing from that sweater's what that dead kid had in his hand.	N
101	101	101	00:08:44	00:08:47	So, we're looking for a girl who bought a new outfit...	N
102	102	102	00:08:49	00:08:52	some earrings and a latte.	N
103	103	103	00:08:52	00:08:55	Oh, an iced cappuccino, actually.	N
104	104	104	00:08:56	00:08:58	Congealed blood in the pericardium.	N
105	105	105	00:08:59	00:09:00	Heart's what took the bullet.	N
106	106	106	00:09:01	00:09:02	Explains why she just dropped.	N
107	107	107	00:09:02	00:09:04	Yeah, she was dead in seconds.	N
108	108	108	00:09:05	00:09:07	Hmm.	N
109	109	109	00:09:07	00:09:08	Bullet's still in the heart.	N
110	110	110	00:09:18	00:09:20	Here we go.	N
111	111	111	00:09:23	00:09:25	There.	N
112	112	112	00:09:28	00:09:32	Well, it looks like a nine millimeter.	N
113	113	113	00:09:32	00:09:33	I'll let Vega know.	N
114	114	114	00:09:34	00:09:35	Fairly intact.	N
115	115	115	00:09:35	00:09:36	Want to do the honors?	N
116	116	116	00:09:36	00:09:38	Sure.	N
117	117	117	00:09:49	00:09:51	That's it.	N
118	118	118	00:09:56	00:09:58	Four inches?	N
119	119	119	00:09:58	00:10:00	That's shallow.	N
120	120	120	00:10:00	00:10:03	Standard handgun bullet penetration's 12.	N
121	121	121	00:10:03	00:10:04	Right.	N
122	122	122	00:10:05	00:10:06	Give me a hand, will you?	N
123	123	123	00:10:06	00:10:08	Sure.	N
124	124	124	00:10:11	00:10:13	85 degree downward angle?	N
125	125	125	00:10:13	00:10:15	Well, that's, uh, fairly standard.	N
126	126	126	00:10:15	00:10:18	Most gunshot wounds are 90 degrees, give or take.	N
127	127	127	00:10:18	00:10:20	Oh. Thanks, Doc.	N
128	128	128	00:10:20	00:10:22	Right.	N
129	129	129	00:11:24	00:11:27	They say in America, you're on camera an average of seven times a day.	N
130	130	130	00:11:27	00:11:29	Go to a mall, and you can at least triple that.	N
131	131	131	00:11:29	00:11:31	I guess that's good for us.	N
132	132	132	00:11:31	00:11:33	I'm going to think twice the next time I try on a shirt.	N
133	133	133	00:11:33	00:11:38	Well, legally, they can't put cameras in dressing rooms, but there's legal, and then there's what people do.	N
134	134	134	00:11:38	00:11:41	31.	N
135	135	135	00:11:41	00:11:46	Let's scan the dressing room footage 00 on.	N
136	136	136	00:11:50	00:11:52	Hold it.	N
137	137	137	00:11:52	00:11:54	That's our sweater.	N
138	138	138	00:11:54	00:11:56	And that's our girl.	N
139	139	139	00:11:56	00:11:57	She did a walk out. A walk out?	N
140	140	140	00:11:57	00:11:59	Yeah, my girlfriend does it all the time.	N
141	141	141	00:11:59	00:12:06	She finds something she likes, rips the tags off in the dressing room, hands them to the clerk, and walks out wearing the new stuff.	N
142	142	142	00:12:06	00:12:08	You go shopping with your girlfriend?	N
143	143	143	00:12:08	00:12:10	That's nice.	N
144	144	144	00:12:10	00:12:12	Well, you can get her prints from the receipts.	N
145	145	145	00:12:12	00:12:13	DNA from the sweater.	N
146	146	146	00:12:13	00:12:14	And you've got a face.	N
147	147	147	00:12:14	00:12:15	You're close.	N
148	148	148	00:12:15	00:12:16	Well, look at her. She's a minor.	N
149	149	149	00:12:16	00:12:17	She paid in cash.	N
150	150	150	00:12:17	00:12:19	She's not going to be in any database.	N
151	151	151	00:12:19	00:12:21	Without a name, we don't have much.	N
152	152	152	00:12:21	00:12:23	Okay, one of our hammers had blood on it.	N
153	153	153	00:12:23	00:12:24	It matches the victim's.	N
154	154	154	00:12:24	00:12:26	Did Greg analyze the clothes from the Dumpster yet?	N
155	155	155	00:12:26	00:12:28	Yeah. Blood's a match, too.	N
156	156	156	00:12:28	00:12:34	Okay. So, the question is, what is the connection between this girl and a construction worker?	N
157	157	157	00:12:34	00:12:37	Mr. Curtwell, where were you this weekend?	N
158	158	158	00:12:37	00:12:39	I was fishing in Tahoe.	N
159	159	159	00:12:40	00:12:41	Catch anything?	N
160	160	160	00:12:41	00:12:43	No. Nothing was biting.	N
161	161	161	00:12:43	00:12:44	Anyone go with you?	N
162	162	162	00:12:44	00:12:46	No.	N
163	163	163	00:12:46	00:12:48	How long were you gone?	N
164	164	164	00:12:48	00:12:50	Friday to Sunday.	N
165	165	165	00:12:50	00:12:52	Look, I thought I was just here to pick up my hammer.	N
166	166	166	00:12:52	00:12:55	Do you ever leave your tools at the job site?	N
167	167	167	00:12:55	00:12:58	No way. That hammer-- it's perfectly balanced.	N
168	168	168	00:12:58	00:13:01	Then how do you explain the blood on it?	N
169	169	169	00:13:01	00:13:03	And your injuries.	N
170	170	170	00:13:05	00:13:07	Well, it's a construction site.	N
171	171	171	00:13:07	00:13:09	People get hurt.	N
172	172	172	00:13:09	00:13:13	The blood that we found on your hammer...	N
173	173	173	00:13:13	00:13:16	matches this kid right here.	N
174	174	174	00:13:25	00:13:27	Is that the dead kid from the house?	N
175	175	175	00:13:27	00:13:28	Yeah.	N
176	176	176	00:13:28	00:13:30	I never got a look at him.	N
177	177	177	00:13:30	00:13:33	I-I I didn't go inside.	N
178	178	178	00:13:35	00:13:37	What about her?	N
179	179	179	00:13:41	00:13:44	That's my kid sister, Ashley.	N
180	180	180	00:13:46	00:13:48	Why? What's she got to do with it?	N
181	181	181	00:13:49	00:13:51	You tell us.	N
182	182	182	00:13:57	00:14:01	My parents died in a car accident four years ago.	N
183	183	183	00:14:01	00:14:02	I'm very sorry.	N
184	184	184	00:14:02	00:14:06	Your brother Gregory is your guardian, right?	N
185	185	185	00:14:06	00:14:08	Yeah.	N
186	186	186	00:14:08	00:14:10	And he left you alone all weekend?	N
187	187	187	00:14:10	00:14:13	He goes away a lot.	N
188	188	188	00:14:13	00:14:14	Okay.	N
189	189	189	00:14:14	00:14:18	Why don't you tell me what happened last night?	N
190	190	190	00:14:18	00:14:24	I was on my way to the mall to get something to eat.	N
191	191	191	00:14:24	00:14:25	I always cut through the construction site.	N
192	192	192	00:14:25	00:14:32	My brother tells me not to, but it saves me, like, ten minutes.	N
193	193	193	00:14:32	00:14:34	That makes sense.	N
194	194	194	00:14:35	00:14:37	What happened after that?	N
195	195	195	00:14:37	00:14:44	Well, this guy from school, Brian, comes out of nowhere.	N
196	196	196	00:14:44	00:14:46	Do you know Brian's last name?	N
197	197	197	00:14:46	00:14:47	Yeah. It's, um...	N
198	198	198	00:14:47	00:14:50	Haddick.	N
199	199	199	00:14:50	00:14:53	We were in homeroom together freshman year.	N
200	200	200	00:14:53	00:15:00	So, anyway, he says his cat ran away...	N
201	201	201	00:15:00	00:15:03	and will I help him find it.	N
202	202	202	00:15:03	00:15:05	And you did?	N
203	203	203	00:15:07	00:15:10	A cat. I'm so stupid.	N
204	204	204	00:15:10	00:15:13	You're not stupid, Ashley.	N
205	205	205	00:15:15	00:15:18	I know this is hard.	N
206	206	206	00:15:18	00:15:23	If we could just go over it from start to finish just one time.	N
207	207	207	00:15:28	00:15:31	So, we walked into the house...	N
208	208	208	00:15:37	00:15:39	I think I saw him come in here.	N
209	209	209	00:15:39	00:15:40	What color is he?	N
210	210	210	00:15:40	00:15:41	Gray.	N
211	211	211	00:15:42	00:15:43	Here, kitty, kitty.	N
212	212	212	00:15:45	00:15:47	You're going to like it, you dirty bitch.	N
213	213	213	00:15:47	00:15:49	You're going to like it.	N
214	214	214	00:15:52	00:15:58	It was like the more I shouted, the more he liked it.	N
215	215	215	00:16:06	00:16:08	Rape is not about sex.	N
216	216	216	00:16:08	00:16:10	It's about violence.	N
217	217	217	00:16:15	00:16:18	You were against the wall.	N
218	218	218	00:16:18	00:16:20	No!	N
219	219	219	00:16:27	00:16:30	Did you see who hit Brian?	N
220	220	220	00:16:33	00:16:38	Ashley, after all that had happened, you went shopping?	N
221	221	221	00:16:38	00:16:40	He was all over me.	N
222	222	222	00:16:40	00:16:43	I just had to get him off me.	N
223	223	223	00:16:44	00:16:47	And you got some coffee and some earrings.	N
224	224	224	00:16:50	00:16:52	What?	N
225	225	225	00:16:54	00:16:56	I bought that stuff?	N
226	226	226	00:16:59	00:17:06	All I remember is getting new clothes and going home.	N
227	227	227	00:17:06	00:17:10	Why does all this bad stuff keep happening to my family?	N
228	228	228	00:17:11	00:17:13	She's covering for her brother.	N
229	229	229	00:17:14	00:17:17	He's got a non- confirmable alibi.	N
230	230	230	00:17:17	00:17:20	I'm sure she doesn't want to lose the only guardian she's got.	N
231	231	231	00:17:28	00:17:32	It's pretty obvious the initial blows were to the head.	N
232	232	232	00:17:32	00:17:34	Well, according to Sara, that's consistent with the girl's story.	N
233	233	233	00:17:35	00:17:37	Whoever attacked him just kept going.	N
234	234	234	00:17:37	00:17:39	Used some real force.	N
235	235	235	00:17:39	00:17:43	Severed his spinal cord at Cl, C2.	N
236	236	236	00:17:43	00:17:45	Well, that would have rendered him immobile.	N
237	237	237	00:17:45	00:17:46	Right, so why keep hitting?	N
238	238	238	00:17:46	00:17:55	The epidermis was disturbed, leaving areas of exposed derma, which we'd normally see as red or purple abrasions.	N
239	239	239	00:17:55	00:17:58	But in this case, no blood rushed to the area.	N
240	240	240	00:17:59	00:18:00	He was beaten postmortem.	N
241	241	241	00:18:00	00:18:02	Right.	N
242	242	242	00:18:02	00:18:06	So, Gregory Curtwell sees Brian attacking his sister.	N
243	243	243	00:18:06	00:18:10	His adrenaline starts going, and he can't stop.	N
244	244	244	00:18:10	00:18:14	Well, Brian may have gotten off a punch of his own.	N
245	245	245	00:18:14	00:18:20	I can't identify the pattern, but I sent blood and skin transfer to Greg.	N
246	246	246	00:18:20	00:18:23	And you're going to need these.	N
247	247	247	00:18:23	00:18:26	Thanks.	N
248	248	248	00:18:32	00:18:34	That's our son.	N
249	249	249	00:18:34	00:18:39	Who could have done this to my baby?	N
250	250	250	00:18:40	00:18:42	Do you recognize this girl?	N
251	251	251	00:18:46	00:18:49	Did Brian ever mention the name Ashley Curtwell?	N
252	252	252	00:18:49	00:18:53	He got a little out of hand for a while.	N
253	253	253	00:18:53	00:18:56	We couldn't keep track of his friends.	N
254	254	254	00:18:56	00:18:58	Out of hand?	N
255	255	255	00:18:58	00:19:01	I found some marijuana in his room.	N
256	256	256	00:19:01	00:19:02	Broke curfew.	N
257	257	257	00:19:02	00:19:05	The nipple piercing was the last straw.	N
258	258	258	00:19:05	00:19:11	I told him he could do anything he wanted to the body God gave him once he moved out.	N
259	259	259	00:19:11	00:19:12	Until then...	N
260	260	260	00:19:12	00:19:14	He was grounded.	N
261	261	261	00:19:14	00:19:17	But he was doing so much better.	N
262	262	262	00:19:17	00:19:20	His grades were up.	N
263	263	263	00:19:20	00:19:21	He got a job.	N
264	264	264	00:19:21	00:19:22	Where did he work?	N
265	265	265	00:19:23	00:19:25	My brother owns a restaurant.	N
266	266	266	00:19:25	00:19:29	Got him a job bussing and waiting tables.	N
267	267	267	00:19:29	00:19:31	500 bucks every two weeks.	N
268	268	268	00:19:31	00:19:34	Cash under the table.	N
269	269	269	00:19:34	00:19:35	Pretty good for a kid who can't drive.	N
270	270	270	00:19:40	00:19:44	No GSR on either the husband's or ex-husband's hands.	N
271	271	271	00:19:44	00:19:45	That's not definitive.	N
272	272	272	00:19:45	00:19:48	One of them still could have fired the gun and washed his hands.	N
273	273	273	00:19:48	00:19:49	Yeah.	N
274	274	274	00:19:50	00:19:54	Well, you know, you asked me to check Marlene Mitchell's bullet for trace?	N
275	275	275	00:19:54	00:19:55	Well, there isn't any.	N
276	276	276	00:19:55	00:19:56	It's in pristine condition.	N
277	277	277	00:19:57	00:20:00	The only reason for shallow penetration is loss of momentum.	N
278	278	278	00:20:00	00:20:04	Yeah, and it was a standard full metal jacket, not a pre-fragmented.	N
279	279	279	00:20:04	00:20:13	So, assuming that the bullet didn't come in contact with any intervening object, what slowed it down?	N
280	280	280	00:20:13	00:20:16	Hey, Sanders, you got anything on that knuckle sludge?	N
281	281	281	00:20:16	00:20:18	Grissom's asking.	N
282	282	282	00:20:18	00:20:25	Yeah, a skin sample taken from Brian Haddick's defensive wounds, hair samples from Ashley Curtwell, and buccal swab collected from Gregory Curtwell.	N
283	283	283	00:20:26	00:20:27	No match to the brother or sister.	N
284	284	284	00:20:28	00:20:29	Construction worker didn't do it.	N
285	285	285	00:20:29	00:20:33	Or he didn't do it alone.	N
286	286	286	00:20:36	00:20:42	72-degree impact angle puts Brian here for the initial blows.	N
287	287	287	00:20:46	00:20:48	Width is three millimeters.	N
288	288	288	00:20:48	00:20:51	Length is six.	N
289	289	289	00:20:53	00:20:56	Arcsine gives us 30 degrees.	N
290	290	290	00:20:56	00:21:00	So, Brian was crawling.	N
291	291	291	00:21:01	00:21:04	That must be where his neck was exposed.	N
292	292	292	00:21:07	00:21:12	He ended up here on the floor with his spinal cord severed.	N
293	293	293	00:21:12	00:21:17	Well, if he was laying down, this looks too high to be a spatter.	N
294	294	294	00:21:17	00:21:19	Must be cast-off.	N
295	295	295	00:21:19	00:21:22	On three walls.	N
296	296	296	00:21:22	00:21:28	Assailants tend to move only in reaction to a target, Brian was stationary.	N
297	297	297	00:21:28	00:21:30	Why would the attacker keep moving?	N
298	298	298	00:21:30	00:21:31	It doesn't make sense.	N
299	299	299	00:21:31	00:21:37	It does if there were three hammers and three attackers.	N
300	300	300	00:21:52	00:21:55	Hey, Catherine, feel like doin' some real work?	N
301	301	301	00:21:55	00:21:57	And leave all this?	N
302	302	302	00:21:58	00:22:01	I got a woman who DFO'd in front of her house trying to break up a fight.	N
303	303	303	00:22:01	00:22:04	It's a single gunshot wound to the chest.	N
304	304	304	00:22:04	00:22:06	The penetration is...	N
305	305	305	00:22:06	00:22:07	shallow.	N
306	306	306	00:22:07	00:22:09	I want to know why.	N
307	307	307	00:22:09	00:22:10	And you want me to cook?	N
308	308	308	00:23:42	00:23:44	Okay, boys.	N
309	309	309	00:23:44	00:23:46	There's always room for Jell-O.	N
310	310	310	00:23:46	00:23:50	Oh, yeah. Uh, Catherine, technically, that's just gel.	N
311	311	311	00:23:50	00:23:51	I wasn't planning on eating it.	N
312	312	312	00:23:54	00:23:56	Okay, let's shoot it.	N
313	313	313	00:23:58	00:24:00	Betty Crocker.	N
314	314	314	00:24:12	00:24:14	Firing one at 100%!	N
315	315	315	00:24:19	00:24:24	Standard velocity is 1,100 feet per second.	N
316	316	316	00:24:25	00:24:31	All right, that is a... 12-inch penetration.	N
317	317	317	00:24:32	00:24:34	So...	N
318	318	318	00:24:34	00:24:35	a, um...	N
319	319	319	00:24:35	00:24:38	100% load gives us 12 inches.	N
320	320	320	00:24:38	00:24:42	Firing one at 70%!	N
321	321	321	00:24:45	00:24:48	Seven and three-quarter inches.	N
322	322	322	00:24:48	00:24:50	Firing one at 40%!	N
323	323	323	00:24:59	00:25:00	500 and...	N
324	324	324	00:25:00	00:25:03	50 feet per second.	N
325	325	325	00:25:04	00:25:05	Four inches.	N
326	326	326	00:25:05	00:25:08	Same as Ms. Mitchell.	N
327	327	327	00:25:08	00:25:12	So Mrs. Mitchell was shot by a bullet traveling 550 feet per second.	N
328	328	328	00:25:12	00:25:15	Now that we know the speed, we can calculate the distance.	N
329	329	329	00:25:15	00:25:16	Thanks, Catherine.	N
330	330	330	00:25:18	00:25:23	So standard velocity for a nine millimeter bullet is 1,100 feet per second.	N
331	331	331	00:25:23	00:25:28	How far does a nine millimeter bullet have to travel before it slows down to 550 feet per second?	N
332	332	332	00:25:28	00:25:30	Let's see.	N
333	333	333	00:25:32	00:25:33	1,800 feet.	N
334	334	334	00:25:33	00:25:36	Whoa. We're talking six football fields.	N
335	335	335	00:25:36	00:25:41	Yeah, that would pretty much eliminate anyone that was in the Mitchells' front yard.	N
336	336	336	00:25:41	00:25:45	Can a nine millimeter bullet even travel that far?	N
337	337	337	00:25:45	00:25:46	Hang on.	N
338	338	338	00:25:48	00:25:50	All right.	N
339	339	339	00:25:51	00:25:54	If a nine millimeter were fired straight...	N
340	340	340	00:25:56	00:26:04	it'd go about 600 feet before gravity brought it down, but if a bullet were fired at an angle...	N
341	341	341	00:26:04	00:26:06	could go a heck of a lot further.	N
342	342	342	00:26:06	00:26:12	That would account for the distance, but Ms. Mitchell was shot at an 85-degree angle.	N
343	343	343	00:26:12	00:26:15	That's basically perpendicular.	N
344	344	344	00:26:15	00:26:16	Um...	N
345	345	345	00:26:16	00:26:19	bullets are predictable.	N
346	346	346	00:26:20	00:26:22	People... aren't.	N
347	347	347	00:26:26	00:26:27	No, stop it!	N
348	348	348	00:26:29	00:26:34	I assumed she was standing.	N
349	349	349	00:26:36	00:26:51	Okay, this is the Mitchells' house, and by all eyewitness accounts, she was standing in front the house, facing away north, when she was shot, so this line represents the 1,800 feet our bullet traveled.	N
350	350	350	00:26:51	00:26:54	It had to have come from somewhere...	N
351	351	351	00:26:55	00:26:58	...on that arc.	N
352	352	352	00:26:59	00:27:02	Good luck knocking on doors.	N
353	353	353	00:27:04	00:27:09	Here I'm looking for three guys, but you only found one hammer with blood on it, so who do you want me to follow?	N
354	354	354	00:27:09	00:27:10	Me.	N
355	355	355	00:27:11	00:27:13	What's up?	N
356	356	356	00:27:13	00:27:17	The shoe tread I found at the scene-- it's a World Industries Diablo.	N
357	357	357	00:27:17	00:27:19	It's a skate shoe.	N
358	358	358	00:27:19	00:27:20	Size 11.	N
359	359	359	00:27:20	00:27:21	On a construction worker?	N
360	360	360	00:27:22	00:27:23	Screams teenager, I know.	N
361	361	361	00:27:23	00:27:26	Why is Gregory Curtwell hanging out with teenage boys?	N
362	362	362	00:27:26	00:27:28	Well, he has a teenage sister.	N
363	363	363	00:27:28	00:27:32	And the sister and Brian Haddick were both students at McKinley High.	N
364	364	364	00:27:32	00:27:36	I bet the shoe also goes to school there.	N
365	365	365	00:27:43	00:27:45	Nice kicks. I like those.	N
366	366	366	00:27:45	00:27:47	Yeah.	N
367	367	367	00:27:47	00:27:50	Uh-huh.	N
368	368	368	00:27:50	00:27:52	Thanks.	N
369	369	369	00:27:52	00:27:55	We're treading a razor-thin line of illegal search and seizure here.	N
370	370	370	00:27:55	00:28:00	Now, I'm not arguing with you, but shoes are a plain-view item.	N
371	371	371	00:28:00	00:28:03	Anyway, here's the guy who's going to be investigating...	N
372	372	372	00:28:03	00:28:05	Tyler, come on, we're going.	N
373	373	373	00:28:05	00:28:07	Are you crazy?	N
374	374	374	00:28:07	00:28:09	Do you know what my law firm does?	N
375	375	375	00:28:09	00:28:11	You can't question these kids without a parent present.	N
376	376	376	00:28:11	00:28:16	We're not questioning them, which is why you're here-- so we can. Oh. And I'm holding you responsible.	N
377	377	377	00:28:16	00:28:22	Clark County Law Enforcement and I have taken every precaution to make sure that these students' rights were not violated.	N
378	378	378	00:28:22	00:28:24	You are sequestering these kids without probable cause.	N
379	379	379	00:28:24	00:28:32	I hate that I've been called out of work to come down here, and I'm going to be so far up your ass, you're not going to be able to sit down straight. You know what I hate?	N
380	380	380	00:28:32	00:28:34	People who hurt kids.	N
381	381	381	00:28:35	00:28:37	And you know who those people sometimes are?	N
382	382	382	00:28:37	00:28:38	Cops?	N
383	383	383	00:28:38	00:28:40	Other kids.	N
384	384	384	00:28:40	00:28:46	If it had been your son whose skull was smashed in with a hammer, you'd be asking me where I was when I should've been protecting him.	N
385	385	385	00:28:46	00:28:51	Kids bring guns to school to shoot other kids, so who are you protecting?	N
386	386	386	00:28:51	00:28:53	Let's discuss it in court.	N
387	387	387	00:28:57	00:28:59	Well, way to clear a room.	N
388	388	388	00:28:59	00:29:04	Those of you with parents here are dismissed, and the rest of you please wait here.	N
389	389	389	00:29:14	00:29:15	Brass.	N
390	390	390	00:29:19	00:29:21	Check this out.	N
391	391	391	00:29:23	00:29:24	Hey, bud.	N
392	392	392	00:29:26	00:29:27	What's your name?	N
393	393	393	00:29:27	00:29:29	Benny.	N
394	394	394	00:29:29	00:29:30	Benny, where's your father? Is he around?	N
395	395	395	00:29:30	00:29:33	Uh, he's at home. Probably called in drunk.	N
396	396	396	00:29:33	00:29:36	Well, lucky for you, we make house calls.	N
397	397	397	00:29:38	00:29:40	Dad?	N
398	398	398	00:29:52	00:29:56	You good for nothing little bastard...	N
399	399	399	00:29:56	00:29:58	I knew you stole that game thing.	N
400	400	400	00:29:58	00:30:00	125 bucks, my ass.	N
401	401	401	00:30:00	00:30:03	I told you. I bought that with my own money.	N
402	402	402	00:30:03	00:30:04	You talkin' back to me?	N
403	403	403	00:30:04	00:30:04	Huh?	N
404	404	404	00:30:05	00:30:06	Let's sit down.	N
405	405	405	00:30:06	00:30:07	Let's all sit down.	N
406	406	406	00:30:07	00:30:09	Come on.	N
407	407	407	00:30:15	00:30:16	Look, I'll take this.	N
408	408	408	00:30:16	00:30:20	Let 'em argue diminished capacity after the fact.	N
409	409	409	00:30:20	00:30:22	You think they know how a DNA test works?	N
410	410	410	00:30:22	00:30:23	I don't know. Let's find out.	N
411	411	411	00:30:23	00:30:28	Mr. Lizzio, do you mind if we test Benny's sneaker for DNA?	N
412	412	412	00:30:28	00:30:31	You do what you got to do, officers.	N
413	413	413	00:30:33	00:30:35	Lift your right shoe, please.	N
414	414	414	00:31:01	00:31:02	We got a problem.	N
415	415	415	00:31:02	00:31:06	The blood on your shoe is a match to Brian Haddick's.	N
416	416	416	00:31:07	00:31:10	DNA doesn't lie.	N
417	417	417	00:31:10	00:31:16	So, do you want to tell us how a dead kid's blood ended up on the bottom of your sneaker, Benny?	N
418	418	418	00:31:16	00:31:19	Yeah, Benny. Why don't you tell us that?	N
419	419	419	00:31:22	00:31:26	Sometimes I go to the construction site just to hang out.	N
420	420	420	00:31:36	00:31:40	So, you just, uh... happened upon it?	N
421	421	421	00:31:40	00:31:42	Didn't report it to anybody?	N
422	422	422	00:31:42	00:31:44	I was trespassing.	N
423	423	423	00:31:44	00:31:45	I didn't want to get in trouble.	N
424	424	424	00:31:45	00:31:50	Mr. Lizzio, would you mind if I took a look around?	N
425	425	425	00:31:50	00:31:53	Be my guest.	N
426	426	426	00:31:56	00:31:58	Mr. Lizzio, why don't you sit down?	N
427	427	427	00:31:58	00:32:00	We're going to be a while, okay?	N
428	428	428	00:32:00	00:32:02	You been drinking today, Mr. Lizzio?	N
429	429	429	00:32:02	00:32:03	Couple of beers.	N
430	430	430	00:32:49	00:32:51	Practice makes perfect.	N
431	431	431	00:32:56	00:33:03	So, Benny, for the record, you've waived your right to have your parent or an advocate present.	N
432	432	432	00:33:03	00:33:04	Yep.	N
433	433	433	00:33:04	00:33:06	So, how do you know Brian?	N
434	434	434	00:33:06	00:33:09	We hung out a few times when we were freshmen.	N
435	435	435	00:33:09	00:33:11	You know Gregory Curtwell?	N
436	436	436	00:33:11	00:33:12	Ashley's brother? Yeah.	N
437	437	437	00:33:12	00:33:14	He bought me beer a couple times.	N
438	438	438	00:33:14	00:33:15	Oh, so you know Ashley, too?	N
439	439	439	00:33:15	00:33:17	Yeah.	N
440	440	440	00:33:17	00:33:20	I'm a friendly guy. Well, that's good, Benny, because...	N
441	441	441	00:33:21	00:33:23	...you're looking at murder.	N
442	442	442	00:33:23	00:33:27	And if you're friendly and you cooperate, and you tell me what happened to Brian Haddick, maybe I can cut you a deal.	N
443	443	443	00:33:27	00:33:30	Ain't gonna happen.	N
444	444	444	00:33:30	00:33:31	I'm no snitch.	N
445	445	445	00:33:31	00:33:34	You want to tell me about those melons at your house?	N
446	446	446	00:33:34	00:33:36	You looking to be another Gallagher?	N
447	447	447	00:33:36	00:33:38	You know who that is?	N
448	448	448	00:33:38	00:33:40	Since when is whacking fruit a crime?	N
449	449	449	00:33:40	00:33:42	When it's practice for whacking people.	N
450	450	450	00:33:42	00:33:46	Your hammer had Brian's blood all over it.	N
451	451	451	00:33:46	00:33:53	Understand something, Benny, I'm talking about months versus years of juvenile detention.	N
452	452	452	00:33:53	00:33:54	It's your call.	N
453	453	453	00:33:57	00:33:59	They got cable?	N
454	454	454	00:33:59	00:34:01	Food?	N
455	455	455	00:34:01	00:34:03	My dad locked on the outside?	N
456	456	456	00:34:05	00:34:09	Sounds good to me.	N
457	457	457	00:34:09	00:34:12	Besides, I'm a minor.	N
458	458	458	00:34:12	00:34:17	By the time I'm 21, it's like it never happened.	N
459	459	459	00:34:20	00:34:22	Did he roll?	N
460	460	460	00:34:22	00:34:24	Brass says the kid is looking forward to going to jail.	N
461	461	461	00:34:24	00:34:25	Hmm.	N
462	462	462	00:34:25	00:34:28	So, what do we got here?	N
463	463	463	00:34:28	00:34:33	It's hard to tell what's relevant and what's trash here.	N
464	464	464	00:34:33	00:34:37	This is everything we brought back from Benny's party room.	N
465	465	465	00:34:41	00:34:42	Are these...?	N
466	466	466	00:34:42	00:34:43	SpaghettiOs?	N
467	467	467	00:34:43	00:34:45	I don't think so.	N
468	468	468	00:34:45	00:34:48	Nah. Nah, those would be orthodontic rubber bands.	N
469	469	469	00:34:48	00:34:50	Hook 'em to your braces, uh, upper to lower.	N
470	470	470	00:34:50	00:34:52	Helps pull the jaw in the right direction.	N
471	471	471	00:34:52	00:34:53	Also great for flinging.	N
472	472	472	00:34:53	00:34:58	Yeah, I had it all-- palate expander, braces, retainer, head gear.	N
473	473	473	00:34:59	00:35:02	Ah, five years of misery, but worth every penny, don't you think?	N
474	474	474	00:35:05	00:35:08	Um, there might be some saliva residue on them.	N
475	475	475	00:35:08	00:35:11	I can see what I can pull off, if you want.	N
476	476	476	00:35:11	00:35:12	Yeah. Would you?	N
477	477	477	00:35:12	00:35:14	Well, you're going to need something.	N
478	478	478	00:35:14	00:35:16	Strike three on the knuckles.	N
479	479	479	00:35:16	00:35:18	Benny's DNA doesn't match. Gregory's doesn't match.	N
480	480	480	00:35:18	00:35:20	Ashley's doesn't match.	N
481	481	481	00:35:20	00:35:22	Who did this guy hit?	N
482	482	482	00:35:22	00:35:23	Greg, test both of these.	N
483	483	483	00:35:23	00:35:28	If a third guy has braces, it may explain the strange pattern on Brian's hand.	N
484	484	484	00:35:28	00:35:31	It's probably another student, but Benny's not talking.	N
485	485	485	00:35:31	00:35:32	Benny has a party room, right?	N
486	486	486	00:35:32	00:35:34	You can't have a party without the music.	N
487	487	487	00:35:34	00:35:37	I found some new CDs in his room.	N
488	488	488	00:35:41	00:35:42	What's C &amp; D?	N
489	489	489	00:35:42	00:35:45	It's like a music club, 12 CDs for the price of one.	N
490	490	490	00:35:48	00:35:51	And Aaron Gilbert was...?	N
491	491	491	00:35:53	00:35:54	The deejay maybe?	N
492	492	492	00:35:54	00:35:58	You know, at this time of year, watermelon isn't cheap, particularly organic.	N
493	493	493	00:35:58	00:36:02	Maybe the music isn't the only thing that Aaron Gilbert brought to the party.	N
494	494	494	00:36:08	00:36:12	Yeah, I heard gunfire a couple of days ago.	N
495	495	495	00:36:12	00:36:15	Johnnie, the idiot behind us, was playing like G.I. Joe in his backyard.	N
496	496	496	00:36:15	00:36:17	I screamed out my window.	N
497	497	497	00:36:17	00:36:19	I got kids, you know?	N
498	498	498	00:36:19	00:36:21	Why do you want to know?	N
499	499	499	00:36:21	00:36:22	Just curious.	N
500	500	500	00:36:22	00:36:24	She called you guys, right?	N
501	501	501	00:36:24	00:36:26	It's like having a wife.	N
502	502	502	00:36:26	00:36:27	Gun's brand-new.	N
503	503	503	00:36:28	00:36:29	Shot it one time.	N
504	504	504	00:36:29	00:36:32	She told me to stop, I stopped.	N
505	505	505	00:36:32	00:36:34	Sir, you're going to have to tell us where that gun is.	N
506	506	506	00:36:41	00:36:42	And this is the gun that you fired?	N
507	507	507	00:36:42	00:36:43	Yeah.	N
508	508	508	00:36:50	00:36:53	Empty ten-round magazine.	N
509	509	509	00:36:53	00:36:54	It was full when you started?	N
510	510	510	00:36:54	00:36:56	Yeah.	N
511	511	511	00:37:07	00:37:10	I, uh, only count nine holes in your target.	N
512	512	512	00:37:10	00:37:13	I must have missed one.	N
513	513	513	00:37:13	00:37:15	Oh, you didn't miss.	N
514	514	514	00:37:21	00:37:24	Hey! You want to kill someone?! ( gunshot )	N
515	515	515	00:37:24	00:37:26	Put that thing away!	N
516	516	516	00:37:30	00:37:33	Just nice and easy.	N
517	517	517	00:37:33	00:37:37	You see, your neighbor didn't lose her kid, but six blocks away, a guy lost his wife.	N
518	518	518	00:37:37	00:37:39	It was just a little target practice.	N
519	519	519	00:37:39	00:37:43	And that's why it's illegal to discharge firearms within the city limits, genius.	N
520	520	520	00:37:52	00:37:53	Aaron Gilbert?	N
521	521	521	00:37:53	00:37:57	Yeah. I'm Detective Brass, Las Vegas Police.	N
522	522	522	00:37:57	00:37:58	We need to talk.	N
523	523	523	00:37:58	00:38:00	Oh, dude, I got to get home.	N
524	524	524	00:38:00	00:38:02	My mom's waiting for me and my brother.	N
525	525	525	00:38:02	00:38:03	Oh, we talked to your mom.	N
526	526	526	00:38:03	00:38:05	Yeah, she gave us your hammer and this.	N
527	527	527	00:38:08	00:38:10	Yo, dawg, we going or what?	N
528	528	528	00:38:13	00:38:15	Or what... dawg.	N
529	529	529	00:38:17	00:38:19	That's a nice Walkman you had.	N
530	530	530	00:38:19	00:38:21	What'd that cost? 125 bucks?	N
531	531	531	00:38:21	00:38:23	Same as Benny's Gameboy.	N
532	532	532	00:38:23	00:38:26	Same as your brother's secret stash.	N
533	533	533	00:38:29	00:38:33	Speaking of Benny, he's not too smart, is he?	N
534	534	534	00:38:33	00:38:36	He wouldn't give up you and your brother for a lesser sentence.	N
535	535	535	00:38:36	00:38:37	You know what?	N
536	536	536	00:38:37	00:38:42	There's an opportunity here, and I think you got more on the ball than Benny.	N
537	537	537	00:38:42	00:38:45	Tell me what happened.	N
538	538	538	00:38:48	00:38:54	Jared... ain't braces a bitch?	N
539	539	539	00:38:54	00:38:55	I see that cut on your lip.	N
540	540	540	00:38:56	00:38:57	Is that where Brian hit you?	N
541	541	541	00:39:00	00:39:03	They do make for a good impression though.	N
542	542	542	00:39:03	00:39:06	See all these grooves here?	N
543	543	543	00:39:06	00:39:09	It's perfect for storing DNA.	N
544	544	544	00:39:09	00:39:13	That would be your DNA.	N
545	545	545	00:39:16	00:39:24	Look, Jared, I'm not a cop, but if you tell me what happened, I will put in a good word for you.	N
546	546	546	00:39:27	00:39:28	We have a problem.	N
547	547	547	00:39:28	00:39:30	We have three hammers and four suspects.	N
548	548	548	00:39:30	00:39:34	Well, the Gilbert brothers both seem ready to go down for it.	N
549	549	549	00:39:34	00:39:36	And Benny can't wait to go to jail.	N
550	550	550	00:39:36	00:39:40	If they were defending Ashley against an attacker, why not say so?	N
551	551	551	00:39:40	00:39:41	They weren't.	N
552	552	552	00:39:41	00:39:44	The smashed watermelon suggests the whole thing was premeditated.	N
553	553	553	00:39:44	00:39:46	Making the motive robbery?	N
554	554	554	00:39:46	00:39:51	Well, Benny, Aaron and Jared each had about $125 worth of cash and assorted prizes.	N
555	555	555	00:39:51	00:39:54	$375.	N
556	556	556	00:39:54	00:39:59	Brian's parents said that he was being paid $500 every two weeks.	N
557	557	557	00:39:59	00:40:00	Cash under the table.	N
558	558	558	00:40:00	00:40:05	It was payday, so who got the other $125?	N
559	559	559	00:40:05	00:40:07	Well, Gregory Curtwell makes good money.	N
560	560	560	00:40:07	00:40:11	125 bucks is a spit in the ocean for a construction worker.	N
561	561	561	00:40:11	00:40:14	If he wasn't defending his sister, then he has no motive.	N
562	562	562	00:40:14	00:40:18	Well, if he didn't do it, how did his hammer end up with Brian's blood on it?	N
563	563	563	00:40:18	00:40:23	Clothing-- $85; earrings - $30; coffee-- four dollars.	N
564	564	564	00:40:24	00:40:25	Getting away with murder...	N
565	565	565	00:40:26	00:40:28	Priceless.	N
566	566	566	00:40:28	00:40:30	That hand that holds the wallet is the hand that rules the world.	N
567	567	567	00:40:30	00:40:32	Huh, Ashley?	N
568	568	568	00:40:35	00:40:41	Your fingerprint in Brian's blood on Jared's money.	N
569	569	569	00:40:41	00:40:44	This is what we call completing the triangle.	N
570	570	570	00:40:44	00:40:49	Okay. So he attacked me, and I did see who defended me.	N
571	571	571	00:40:49	00:40:55	But I didn't want to get my friends in trouble, and the money was for, like...	N
572	572	572	00:40:55	00:40:57	like, pain and suffering.	N
573	573	573	00:40:57	00:40:59	You weren't attacked, Ashley. Brian was.	N
574	574	574	00:40:59	00:41:03	We figured none of the boys wore cotton candy, so we had it tested.	N
575	575	575	00:41:03	00:41:05	Turns out you were at Benny's house, too.	N
576	576	576	00:41:07	00:41:08	Let's do it!	N
577	577	577	00:41:11	00:41:11	Come on, guys!	N
578	578	578	00:41:11	00:41:13	Whoo!	N
579	579	579	00:41:19	00:41:24	At the mall, you weren't in shock, you were celebrating.	N
580	580	580	00:41:29	00:41:32	Your brother was up in Tahoe this past weekend, wasn't he?	N
581	581	581	00:41:32	00:41:35	He goes away almost every weekend.	N
582	582	582	00:41:35	00:41:39	You know, I'm done with the Ashley pity party.	N
583	583	583	00:41:39	00:41:45	My guess is Aaron and Jared only had one hammer, but you had access to your brother's tools.	N
584	584	584	00:41:45	00:41:47	Why Brian?	N
585	585	585	00:41:49	00:41:57	Before he went straight, we were buds, but then he got too good for us, but he wasn't too good to want to get with this.	N
586	586	586	00:41:57	00:41:58	Where do you want to do it at?	N
587	587	587	00:41:59	00:42:00	Right here.	N
588	588	588	00:42:00	00:42:02	In here? Yeah.	N
589	589	589	00:42:09	00:42:11	You set me up?	N
590	590	590	00:42:14	00:42:15	They have to do it!	N
591	591	591	00:42:23	00:42:27	You're not a victim, you were a lure.	N
592	592	592	00:42:27	00:42:32	Do you know how many people don't report a rape because they're afraid that no one will believe them?	N
593	593	593	00:42:32	00:42:34	Of course.	N
594	594	594	00:42:34	00:42:36	It's what I was counting on.	N
595	595	595	00:42:36	00:42:42	I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that you're tried as an adult.	N
596	596	596	00:42:43	00:42:45	Good luck.	N
597	597	597	00:42:47	00:42:56	I dress up real nice-- couple barrettes, little lace collar, two dead parents.	N
598	598	598	00:42:56	00:42:59	I'll be the saddest little girl in the world.	N
