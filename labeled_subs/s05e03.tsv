0	00:00:34	00:00:35	Everything all right, Sybil?	N
1	00:00:36	00:00:36	I'm fine.	N
2	00:00:36	00:00:37	What's taking Alicia so long?	N
3	00:00:37	00:00:39	We have a doctor's appointment in 40 minutes.	N
4	00:00:40	00:00:41	She's not here.	N
5	00:00:41	00:00:42	She has to be.	N
6	00:00:42	00:00:43	I saw her leave for school this morning.	N
7	00:00:43	00:00:46	Alicia hasn't been in any of her classes.	N
8	00:00:48	00:00:50	April, get off the phone. I can't talk right now.	N
9	00:00:50	00:00:52	Somebody took Alicia!	N
10	00:00:55	00:00:56	What did you do?!	N
11	00:00:56	00:00:59	What the hell did you do?!	N
12	00:00:59	00:01:00	Mom, I don't know...	N
13	00:01:00	00:01:01	Where is she?!	N

17	00:01:08	00:01:11	I don't get to see Alicia all that much.	N
18	00:01:11	00:01:13	Um, I don't get to.	N
19	00:01:13	00:01:19	Her life sucks, so sometimes she would just, you know, play hooky and spend the day with me.	N
20	00:01:19	00:01:21	After girls' day out, you stopped here for a snack.	N
21	00:01:25	00:01:26	Your father?	N
22	00:01:26	00:01:28	Yeah. Um...	N

24	00:01:29	00:01:33	you know, to get something while she changed back into her uniform.	N
25	00:01:33	00:01:34	In the car? It's not that big of a deal.	N
26	00:01:34	00:01:41	It's like, you know, the skirt over the jeans, and back to school before Mom knows anything So what did he look like?	N
27	00:01:41	00:01:43	What kind of car did he drive?	N
28	00:01:43	00:01:44	Alicia!	N
29	00:01:45	00:01:47	A black guy, uh...	N
30	00:01:47	00:01:51	He had a beard and he had a crappy black Buick.	N
31	00:01:51	00:01:52	But, um...	N
32	00:01:52	00:01:54	I don't know, maybe it was blue.	N
33	00:01:56	00:01:59	I don't really...	N
34	00:01:59	00:02:00	No, that's... that's good.	N
35	00:02:00	00:02:02	You did good. That's good. Thank you. Okay.	N
36	00:02:11	00:02:13	The cops won't tell us.	N
37	00:02:13	00:02:16	What are the chances of finding our daughter?	N
38	00:02:16	00:02:17	We're doing everything we can.	N
39	00:02:17	00:02:18	That's what everyone keeps saying.	N
40	00:02:18	00:02:20	No one will tell us anything.	N
41	00:02:20	00:02:22	Did you injure yourself, Mrs. Perez?	N
42	00:02:24	00:02:26	Oh, a nosebleed.	N
43	00:02:26	00:02:28	That's a lot of blood.	N
44	00:02:28	00:02:30	I'm going to need to take your shirt.	N
45	00:02:31	00:02:36	Why? If you like, I can have someone follow you home so that you can change.	N
46	00:02:36	00:02:37	You think we had something to do with it?	N
47	00:02:37	00:02:40	Our daughter is missing.	N
48	00:02:40	00:02:42	She's out there somewhere alone and scared.	N
49	00:02:42	00:02:43	What are you doing about that?!	N
50	00:02:44	00:02:45	I'm just collecting evidence.	N
51	00:02:45	00:02:46	Fine.	N
52	00:02:46	00:02:47	Here!	N
53	00:02:47	00:02:49	Take it!	N
54	00:02:49	00:02:51	Go find her!	N
55	00:03:24	00:03:26	This is Captain Jim Brass.	N
56	00:03:26	00:03:28	I want to issue a Missing Persons Emergency Alert Amber.	N
57	00:03:28	00:03:31	Notify all radio and casino signatories.	N
58	00:03:31	00:03:33	The description is as follows...	N
59	00:03:35	00:03:39	We have breaking news from the Channel 8 newsroom right now.	N
60	00:03:39	00:03:43	An Amber Alert has been issued for missing 13-year-old Alicia Perez.	N
61	00:03:43	00:03:53	The suspect in Alicia's abduction is described as an African American man, 35 to 45 years old, about six feet tall.	N
62	00:03:53	00:03:54	How'd you shoot, man?	N
63	00:03:54	00:03:56	Rusty.	N
64	00:03:56	00:03:57	They say I have a flinch.	N
65	00:03:57	00:03:59	You and I need to go practice some, huh?	N
66	00:04:00	00:04:02	Yeah, when do we have time to do that?	N
67	00:04:02	00:04:05	If we're not processing a scene or working evidence, we're in court.	N
68	00:04:05	00:04:06	Well, when they take your piece, you'll make time.	N
69	00:04:06	00:04:09	This girl seemed a little old to be lured by a lost puppy.	N
70	00:04:09	00:04:12	So how'd this guy pull this off in a lot this public?	N
71	00:04:12	00:04:15	Easy. With a map and a smile.	N
72	00:04:15	00:04:17	Rolls up-- Hey, little girl, I'm lost.	N
73	00:04:17	00:04:18	You from around here?	N
74	00:04:18	00:04:22	She gets close enough he pulls her out of her sister's car, into his car...	N
75	00:04:22	00:04:23	Bam, she's done.	N
76	00:04:23	00:04:25	I bet he had a weapon.	N
77	00:04:25	00:04:26	Threatened her, so he could drive.	N
78	00:04:26	00:04:28	Probably used his fists.	N
79	00:04:29	00:04:30	Bastard had to have hit her.	N
80	00:04:35	00:04:38	Look, dude, I didn't see it.	N
81	00:04:38	00:04:43	Chica had a nice, round ass and that's what I was scoping.	N
82	00:04:43	00:04:45	What time was that?	N
83	00:04:45	00:04:46	00.	N
84	00:04:46	00:04:51	She comes in, grabs some candy, looks outside, waves at somebody.	N
85	00:04:51	00:04:54	The next thing I know, she flips her wig.	N
86	00:04:54	00:04:56	She's screaming about her sister.	N
87	00:04:56	00:04:58	I didn't see the girl or a car.	N
88	00:04:58	00:05:01	Besides, there's a lot of traffic out there.	N
89	00:05:01	00:05:02	Was it busy?	N
90	00:05:02	00:05:03	Kind of.	N
91	00:05:03	00:05:05	How many surveillance cameras do you have in here?	N
92	00:05:05	00:05:08	Inside we got five.	N
93	00:05:08	00:05:10	They're all state-of-the-art.	N
94	00:05:10	00:05:12	Place gets hit a lot.	N
95	00:05:12	00:05:14	Outside they're all dummies.	N
96	00:05:14	00:05:18	Well, I'm glad to see you're so concerned about your customers after they leave the store.	N
97	00:05:20	00:05:21	Hello.	N
98	00:05:23	00:05:25	Yeah.	N
99	00:05:25	00:05:27	What do you mean?	N
100	00:05:27	00:05:29	What?	N
101	00:05:29	00:05:31	Nick, you failed firearms qualification.	N
102	00:05:31	00:05:32	You can't be here.	N
103	00:05:32	00:05:37	Oh, yeah. Well, I'm taking it again day after tomorrow, so I figured I could work. Not in the field.	N
104	00:05:37	00:05:38	You're serious?	N
105	00:05:38	00:05:40	You're in violation just carrying the weapon.	N
106	00:05:43	00:05:45	Copy that.	N
107	00:05:45	00:05:46	I'll be in the lab.	N
108	00:05:48	00:05:50	Uh, Nick, let me catch a lift with you.	N
109	00:05:51	00:05:53	There's something going on with Lindsey.	N
110	00:05:57	00:06:00	I'm Catherine Willows. What's the trouble?	N
111	00:06:00	00:06:02	With the Amber Alert, we've been keeping an eye out.	N
112	00:06:02	00:06:06	Found your daughter up on Boulder Highway trying to hitch a ride downtown.	N
113	00:06:06	00:06:09	Now, kids this age, they need a firm hand at home, and...	N
114	00:06:09	00:06:10	Thank you, officer.	N
115	00:06:10	00:06:12	I appreciate everything you've done.	N
116	00:06:12	00:06:13	Let's go.	N
117	00:06:20	00:06:25	Okay, what or who is on Fremont Street that you would risk your life to get to?	N
118	00:06:25	00:06:29	Mouthing off to teachers, slipping grades and now hitchhiking.	N
119	00:06:29	00:06:31	I mean, what is next, Lindsey?	N
120	00:06:31	00:06:34	Stripping.	N
121	00:06:34	00:06:35	What did you just say?	N
122	00:06:38	00:06:43	Okay, no phone, no friends, no nothing.	N
123	00:06:43	00:06:45	For how long? A month.	N
124	00:06:45	00:06:46	Whatever.	N
125	00:06:46	00:06:49	Hey, you want to make it two?	N
126	00:06:49	00:06:50	Dad always said you were a drama queen.	N
127	00:06:50	00:06:53	Well, what do you expect, Lindsey, since he was always high.	N
128	00:06:54	00:06:57	I'd take Dad high over you any day!	N
129	00:06:57	00:06:59	Nana's coming to pick me up.	N
130	00:06:59	00:07:00	I'll be out front.	N
131	00:07:05	00:07:07	You paged.	N
132	00:07:07	00:07:08	Yeah.	N
133	00:07:08	00:07:10	What's missing?	N
134	00:07:13	00:07:15	I give up.	N
135	00:07:15	00:07:19	Her sister said the victim changed back into her school uniform in the car.	N
136	00:07:19	00:07:22	So? Where are the clothes she changed out of?	N
137	00:07:22	00:07:24	Hello.	N
138	00:07:24	00:07:26	Mia Dickerson, Warrick Brown.	N
139	00:07:26	00:07:28	Welcome.	N
140	00:07:28	00:07:33	Look, I already know you have a running bet with another CSI over how long the new hire lasts, so let's skip it.	N
141	00:07:33	00:07:35	You got something for DNA?	N
142	00:07:37	00:07:38	The mother's bloody T-shirt.	N
143	00:07:38	00:07:39	Exemplar?	N
144	00:07:39	00:07:40	It's on its way.	N
145	00:07:45	00:07:47	Just hedging my bets.	N
146	00:07:47	00:07:52	How so? Well, I need field experience, but before I get that, I need to find a replacement.	N
147	00:07:52	00:07:53	So far, I'm o-for-one.	N
148	00:07:53	00:07:59	Plus, she's hot and thinks you're a tool, so I'm way ahead.	N
149	00:08:01	00:08:03	A gardener and a pool man come in once a week.	N
150	00:08:03	00:08:05	How long have they worked for you?	N
151	00:08:05	00:08:06	Years.	N
152	00:08:06	00:08:09	How about a housekeeper or a maid?	N
153	00:08:09	00:08:10	I do it.	N
154	00:08:10	00:08:13	Let's talk about your daughter's routines.	N
155	00:08:13	00:08:19	Her routes to and from school, any extra-curricular activities, a list of friends.	N
156	00:08:19	00:08:20	There wasn't any after school stuff.	N
157	00:08:21	00:08:22	Alicia isn't a joiner.	N
158	00:08:22	00:08:24	She walks to school, I pick her up. That's it.	N
159	00:08:24	00:08:26	How often did April get her sister to skip school?	N
160	00:08:29	00:08:30	We don't know.	N
161	00:08:30	00:08:31	We... we just found out ourselves.	N
162	00:08:31	00:08:37	I'm curious because April said she hardly ever gets to see Alicia.	N
163	00:08:37	00:08:39	Why didn't she just come here?	N
164	00:08:39	00:08:40	Because she wasn't welcome.	N
165	00:08:41	00:08:42	We kicked her out.	N
166	00:08:43	00:08:44	April's a troubled girl.	N
167	00:08:44	00:08:46	Problems with drugs, the police.	N
168	00:08:47	00:08:52	You might as well know, she also did some time. Juvenile lockup.	N
169	00:08:52	00:08:53	For what?	N
170	00:08:53	00:08:56	Heroin possession. Intent to distribute.	N
171	00:08:56	00:08:59	There's nothing suspicious on the server.	N
172	00:08:59	00:09:01	Only hits are music downloads.	N
173	00:09:01	00:09:03	Wait a minute.	N
174	00:09:03	00:09:04	An organ transplant site.	N
175	00:09:04	00:09:07	For kidneys, heart, lungs and liver.	N
176	00:09:07	00:09:08	What is that, homework research?	N
177	00:09:08	00:09:12	Maybe. These are pretty detailed biochem and immunosuppressant citations.	N
178	00:09:13	00:09:16	It's a little over a seventh grader's head, don't you think?	N
179	00:09:16	00:09:17	I don't know.	N
180	00:09:17	00:09:19	I bet you were a pretty smart seventh grader.	N
181	00:09:30	00:09:33	She has a serious crush on a boy named Jimmy Jones.	Y
182	00:09:40	00:09:42	Sara.	N
183	00:09:43	00:09:46	I hate Mom &amp; Dad.	Y
184	00:09:48	00:09:49	Who doesn't once in a while?	N
185	00:09:53	00:09:54	Daniel Perez.	Y
186	00:09:54	00:09:56	And you are...?	Y
187	00:09:56	00:09:58	Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle, Las Vegas Crime Lab.	N
188	00:09:58	00:10:01	I guess that's why you're pawing through my sister's private stuff.	Y
189	00:10:01	00:10:03	It's going to help us find her.	Y
190	00:10:03	00:10:05	Do you know a Jimmy Jones?	N
191	00:10:05	00:10:06	Yeah, a boy from school.	Y
192	00:10:06	00:10:07	She liked him.	Y
193	00:10:07	00:10:08	What's your sister like?	N
194	00:10:08	00:10:12	Personable, friendly, outgoing, trusting, maybe?	N
195	00:10:12	00:10:16	She's a giver-- from the day she was born.	N
196	00:10:17	00:10:21	Uh, Daniel... you're bleeding.	N
197	00:10:21	00:10:24	I'm sorry.	N
198	00:10:25	00:10:29	You want to know my sister, you should check her diary under the mattress.	N
199	00:10:44	00:10:46	Last night I didn't sleep very good.	N
200	00:10:46	00:10:48	I kept thinking about the surgery.	Y
201	00:10:48	00:10:51	I guess we know why she was doing transplant research.	Y
202	00:10:53	00:10:55	Serious illness takes a toll on a family.	N
203	00:10:57	00:10:58	Alicia never complained.	N
204	00:11:00	00:11:01	She's used to the doctors.	N
205	00:11:01	00:11:06	She has friends there-- people who understand-- go through the same hell.	N
206	00:11:06	00:11:09	You know, if a victim has a serious illness, you really should disclose it right away.	N
207	00:11:09	00:11:12	Our daughter isn't sick.	Y
208	00:11:12	00:11:15	Our son's kidneys are failing.	N
209	00:11:15	00:11:17	Alicia is his matching donor.	N
210	00:11:17	00:11:19	Without her, he'd die.	N
211	00:11:23	00:11:27	Well, Alicia was a great half-back-- strong right leg, aggressive.	N
212	00:11:27	00:11:28	You don't see that too much in girls.	N
213	00:11:29	00:11:30	She played soccer?	N
214	00:11:30	00:11:31	Yeah, for awhile.	N
215	00:11:31	00:11:32	She quit before she got cut.	N
216	00:11:32	00:11:38	She missed a lot of practice 'cause she was always going to the doctor, and you can't really play with one kidney anyway, so...	N
217	00:11:38	00:11:40	She told you about her brother?	N
218	00:11:40	00:11:41	Yeah, on the way to school.	N
219	00:11:41	00:11:45	Hell, I thought that it was cool that she was saving his life, but she seemed pretty pissed.	N
220	00:11:45	00:11:47	Jimmy... language.	N
221	00:11:47	00:11:48	Sorry.	N
222	00:11:48	00:11:50	Anyway, uh, she didn't seem too happy.	N
223	00:11:50	00:11:53	Said she had no life and never would.	N
224	00:11:53	00:11:58	So, Jimmy, on your way to and from school, did anyone ever bother you or approach you in any way?	N
225	00:11:58	00:11:59	Um...	N
226	00:12:00	00:12:03	there was this one guy, with a track suit, he was supposed to be running.	N
227	00:12:03	00:12:04	He gave me the creeps.	N
228	00:12:04	00:12:06	What gave you the creeps?	N
229	00:12:06	00:12:07	Well, start with his gear.	N
230	00:12:07	00:12:09	I mean, nobody runs in velour.	N
231	00:12:09	00:12:11	And he never had any water and he was always on the phone.	N
232	00:12:11	00:12:12	What'd he look like?	N
233	00:12:12	00:12:13	Black guy.	N
234	00:12:13	00:12:16	He was not a runner, but he was in shape.	N
235	00:12:16	00:12:17	Bald, mustache, beard.	N
236	00:12:18	00:12:19	How old would you say he is, Jimmy?	N
237	00:12:19	00:12:22	Qld... like 30.	N
238	00:12:23	00:12:26	I just... never liked the way he looked at Alicia.	N
239	00:12:28	00:12:30	Thanks. You've been a great help, Jimmy. Thank you.	N
240	00:12:30	00:12:34	Uh, if it's okay with your mom, I'm going to have you hang around, look at some photos.	N
241	00:12:34	00:12:35	All right? Sure.	N
242	00:12:36	00:12:42	Here's the Perez house, Alicia's walk route to school, and the convenience store where she was taken.	N
243	00:12:42	00:12:46	All the locations are within a half-mile, plus or minus three-tenths.	N
244	00:12:46	00:12:52	This is a map of all registered sex offenders in the state, the county, and the neighborhood.	N
245	00:12:52	00:12:54	Phew! That's a lot of perverts.	N
246	00:12:54	00:12:55	Get out of jail, come to Vegas.	N
247	00:12:55	00:12:59	They're listed in tiers of projected recidivism, zero through three.	N
248	00:12:59	00:13:01	Three being the most dangerous.	N
249	00:13:01	00:13:06	They're the ones most likely to plan an abduction and find the privacy for sexual assault and murder.	N
250	00:13:06	00:13:13	If I remove the zeroes and ones, since they have a low or moderate risk designation, this is what we're left with.	N
251	00:13:13	00:13:15	That's still a lot of perverts.	N
252	00:13:15	00:13:17	Mm, maybe not.	N
253	00:13:17	00:13:20	Here, I'll isolate the Perez neighborhood.	N
254	00:13:21	00:13:29	Marlon Waylord, Tier Two, 38, black, lives alone, sometimes handyman and fits Jimmy Jones' description.	N
255	00:13:41	00:13:42	Officer.	N
256	00:13:44	00:13:47	Did you, uh, cut yourself shaving, Mr. Waylord.	N
257	00:13:50	00:13:52	Marlon must be shy.	N
258	00:13:52	00:13:53	Marlon didn't do nothing.	N
259	00:13:53	00:13:56	And I believe you, too. Come on, step over here, please.	N
260	00:13:59	00:14:10	You all know that sex offenders under a felony conviction have absolutely no unconditional release and are under lifetime supervision, automatically assigned by the Nevada Criminal State Justice system.	N
261	00:14:10	00:14:14	Mandated, of course, by state and federal Megan's Law in effect 5/17/96.	N
262	00:14:14	00:14:18	And therefore I am required to register and update my information...	N
263	00:14:18	00:14:22	whenever I move from my current, uh, domicile.	N
264	00:14:22	00:14:24	Well, that's a big word.	N
265	00:14:24	00:14:27	Well, you got all your facts right, Marlon.	N
266	00:14:27	00:14:28	Help us with this one.	N
267	00:14:28	00:14:30	We know you own a Buick. Where is it?	N
268	00:14:30	00:14:33	Tangiers' parking lot.	N
269	00:14:33	00:14:35	It wouldn't start.	N
270	00:14:35	00:14:36	I hate that.	N
271	00:14:36	00:14:37	I'll have it towed to the lab.	N
272	00:14:37	00:14:38	You do that.	N
273	00:15:08	00:15:11	Presence of semen.	N
274	00:15:27	00:15:30	There's children's underwear in the bedroom.	N
275	00:15:32	00:15:36	Photos of children on his phone, including Alicia.	N
276	00:15:40	00:15:44	When you go up, I won't yell short eyes first.	N
277	00:15:44	00:15:45	How's that sound?	N
278	00:15:45	00:15:47	Sounds like a really good deal...	N
279	00:15:47	00:15:49	you know, if I was, um, guilty.	N
280	00:15:50	00:15:51	The inmates didn't treat you too gentle the last time.	N
281	00:15:52	00:15:54	Did they?	N
282	00:15:55	00:15:57	You know they didn't.	N
283	00:15:57	00:15:58	So tell me what you did with Alicia.	N
284	00:16:00	00:16:01	Who?	N
285	00:16:02	00:16:05	She's been all over the news, non-stop.	N
286	00:16:05	00:16:07	It's that why you shaved?	N
287	00:16:12	00:16:13	Oh, come on.	N
288	00:16:13	00:16:15	Don't make me smack you.	N
289	00:16:23	00:16:26	Her friend tells us that you were always looking at her.	N
290	00:16:26	00:16:30	You went out in the morning and watched them go to school.	N
291	00:16:30	00:16:36	She's sweet, very sweet, but, fellas... I wasn't looking at her.	N
292	00:16:36	00:16:37	You all should check my file.	N
293	00:16:38	00:16:39	No, I did.	N
294	00:16:39	00:16:44	I know that your recent preference is for little boys, but, uh, your first time was with a female cousin.	N
295	00:16:44	00:16:45	Let me read what you said.	N
296	00:16:45	00:16:49	I couldn't help myself 'cause she was acting so hot.	N
297	00:16:49	00:16:51	It was her fault; she was really hot.	N
298	00:16:52	00:16:55	How does a six-year-old act hot?	N
299	00:16:59	00:17:01	Listen...	N
300	00:17:01	00:17:04	I'm, uh... I'm sick.	N
301	00:17:04	00:17:07	You know, I got this-this this illness, which... Look.	N
302	00:17:07	00:17:09	I don't want to go back to prison.	N
303	00:17:09	00:17:11	That's why I'm being so compliant.	N
304	00:17:11	00:17:13	Now, yo, I don't work near no little kids.	N
305	00:17:13	00:17:15	I stay a hundred yards from the school grounds.	N
306	00:17:16	00:17:17	Man, I don't even go to the park.	N
307	00:17:17	00:17:19	It's not a disease. It's a compulsion.	N
308	00:17:19	00:17:22	I stay away from youth organizations, after-school programs, churches...	N
309	00:17:22	00:17:25	We found a pair of boy's underwear in your bedroom.	N
310	00:17:25	00:17:26	Explain that.	N
311	00:17:26	00:17:28	I look at the photos.	N
312	00:17:28	00:17:33	I look at the photos and I have the briefs for, um...	N
313	00:17:33	00:17:35	release.	N
314	00:17:35	00:17:40	So you fantasize, and eventually, the fantasy's not enough and you relapse.	N
315	00:17:40	00:17:42	Hey, they're mine.	N
316	00:17:42	00:17:44	I bought the underwear!	N
317	00:17:44	00:17:48	Well, if that's true, then you were in a store where little children were shopping with their mothers.	N
318	00:17:48	00:17:50	And what would you have me do, huh, man?	N
319	00:17:50	00:17:54	What?! I mean, I even thought about chemical castration.	N
320	00:17:54	00:17:56	Medroxyprogesterone is inconclusive.	N
321	00:17:56	00:18:01	It renders the subject incapable of erection, but it doesn't remove the sex drive.	N
322	00:18:01	00:18:05	You would still be capable of sexual assault using other objects.	N
323	00:18:10	00:18:11	Listen...	N
324	00:18:11	00:18:21	Um, I haven't done anything, uh, illegal, so you can't hold me in here forever.	N
325	00:18:23	00:18:31	Oh, is that killing look in your eyes a compulsion, Mr. Grissom?	N
326	00:18:34	00:18:36	What's up?	N
327	00:18:37	00:18:41	The seminal fluid on the boy's underwear matches your pedophile.	N
328	00:18:41	00:18:42	Epithelials?	N
329	00:18:42	00:18:44	His. And only his.	N
330	00:18:44	00:18:47	That confirms his story that the briefs were never worn.	N
331	00:18:47	00:18:48	Hair?	N
332	00:18:48	00:18:50	Synthetic. Probably from a wig.	N
333	00:18:51	00:18:53	Great. That means we have to let the bastard go.	N
334	00:18:53	00:18:56	It's only a matter of time before he snatches up another kid.	N
335	00:18:56	00:18:57	You got any friends in uniform?	N
336	00:18:57	00:19:01	Yeah, but they can't watch him indefinitely.	N
337	00:19:01	00:19:02	Okay.	N
338	00:19:02	00:19:03	Megan's Law has holes.	N
339	00:19:03	00:19:06	Police aren't required to notify a community about a predator.	N
340	00:19:06	00:19:10	So flood his block with flyers detailing his crimes.	N
341	00:19:10	00:19:12	Trust me, the neighbors won't let him out of their sight.	N
342	00:19:12	00:19:14	Or they'll kill him.	N
343	00:19:19	00:19:23	They found Alicia Perez.	N
344	00:19:28	00:19:31	00 p.m.	N
345	00:19:31	00:19:35	How many people have walked through the crime scene?	N
346	00:19:35	00:19:39	Just the responding officers, lug soles, sizes 10 and 11.	N
347	00:19:39	00:19:42	We're going to need some time here, Jim.	N
348	00:19:42	00:19:46	Yeah, well, there's no rush now.	N
349	00:19:48	00:19:50	She's wrapped up pretty tight.	N
350	00:19:50	00:19:53	Protecting her against insects and carrion, maybe.	N
351	00:19:55	00:19:58	Somebody, uh, wanted her intact.	N
352	00:20:00	00:20:04	Well, her face is covered, that means remorse, guilt... somebody cared.	N
353	00:20:07	00:20:09	She's been re-dressed.	N
354	00:20:12	00:20:13	Her panties are missing.	N
355	00:20:13	00:20:15	All right. 360-degree grid search.	N
356	00:20:16	00:20:18	Sometimes rapists like to relive the event.	N
357	00:20:18	00:20:20	He may have wanted to watch her.	N
358	00:20:20	00:20:21	So keep the body in view.	N
359	00:20:21	00:20:27	We're looking for shoe prints, sperm clusters... anything else you can find.	N
360	00:21:03	00:21:04	90 degrees?	N
361	00:21:04	00:21:07	Given the timeline, it should be higher.	N
362	00:21:07	00:21:08	That-that can't be right.	N
363	00:21:08	00:21:12	Well, today's temp., last night's weather...	N
364	00:21:12	00:21:13	may have had something to do with it.	N
365	00:21:13	00:21:15	No signs of sexual assault.	N
366	00:21:17	00:21:19	No defensive wounds.	N
367	00:21:19	00:21:21	No wounds of any kind.	N
368	00:21:21	00:21:22	Were you expecting some?	N
369	00:21:23	00:21:25	Well, she was wrapped in a bloody blanket.	N
370	00:21:26	00:21:29	Since there's no trauma, maybe the blood belongs to her killer.	N
371	00:21:31	00:21:32	Roll her.	N
372	00:21:35	00:21:36	Look at those marks.	N
373	00:21:36	00:21:40	There was nothing underneath her at the crime scene that, uh, would've made those.	N
374	00:21:40	00:21:42	Well, maybe she was moved.	N
375	00:21:42	00:21:43	Trunk of a car?	N
376	00:21:43	00:21:44	Tire iron?	N
377	00:21:45	00:21:49	Yeah, but there's, uh, two impressions, and they're too long to be a lug wrench.	N
378	00:22:12	00:22:13	Have you been to bed?	N
379	00:22:15	00:22:16	Yeah.	N
380	00:22:18	00:22:19	Did you sleep?	N
381	00:22:23	00:22:25	Me neither.	N
382	00:22:25	00:22:28	She was the same age as Lindsey.	N
383	00:22:28	00:22:31	She was trying to hitchhike.	N
384	00:22:33	00:22:35	Where was she going?	N
385	00:22:35	00:22:36	Fremont Street.	N
386	00:22:39	00:22:40	Was she buying drugs?	N
387	00:22:40	00:22:43	No! She's 12.	N
388	00:22:47	00:22:50	She's... just so angry.	N
389	00:22:51	00:22:53	She doesn't talk to me.	N
390	00:22:53	00:22:58	Well, if enough people knew what was out there hunting them, they'd never leave their house.	Y
391	00:23:00	00:23:01	I think you need to sit her down.	N
392	00:23:01	00:23:04	Well, I don't want to scare her.	N
393	00:23:04	00:23:12	I don't want my daughter to be this... frightened, paranoid kid who's always looking over her shoulder.	N
394	00:23:12	00:23:15	Katherine, there's a big difference between scaring her and preparing her.	N
395	00:23:18	00:23:22	And all the reasons why you should are in that room.	N
396	00:23:26	00:23:27	What is all this bone scarring?	N
397	00:23:27	00:23:29	I thought you should be interested.	N
398	00:23:29	00:23:32	12 holes exactly made by a large bore needle.	N
399	00:23:33	00:23:35	Marrow harvest?	N
400	00:23:35	00:23:37	Young Alicia donated bone marrow at least twice.	N
401	00:23:38	00:23:41	Pretty selfless thing to do once, considering how painful the procedure is.	N
402	00:23:43	00:23:52	What most likely causes shortness of breath, obvious bruising, sudden nosebleeds, petechiae?	N
403	00:23:55	00:24:00	Sounds like acute leukemia, but without immunophenotyping, I couldn't tell you what kind.	N
404	00:24:01	00:24:03	Alicia's cause of death?	Y
405	00:24:03	00:24:04	Cardiopulmonary arrest.	Y
406	00:24:04	00:24:05	Time of death?	Y
407	00:24:05	00:24:07	That's a little trickier.	N
408	00:24:07	00:24:09	No solids in the stomach contents, just a milky liquid.	N
409	00:24:10	00:24:18	Liver mortis was fixed and deep purple with a vitreous humor potassium level of 20 millimoles per liter with faint putrefaction.	Y
410	00:24:18	00:24:24	So, I'd say she's been dead about... 44 hours 00 a.m., the day of her kidnapping.	Y
411	00:24:24	00:24:27	Which means April Perez was lying about the abduction.	N
412	00:24:27	00:24:30	Yep. Story's got more holes than her sister's bones.	N
413	00:24:30	00:24:32	I bought it The hell we all bought it.	N
414	00:24:32	00:24:36	But your sister was already dead when you raised that alarm.	N
415	00:24:36	00:24:37	Her body told us that.	N
416	00:24:38	00:24:40	There was no sexual assault.	N
417	00:24:40	00:24:42	The evidence told us that, too.	N
418	00:24:42	00:24:44	So you didn't think this through, sweetheart.	N
419	00:24:44	00:24:46	So what are we left with?	N
420	00:24:46	00:24:50	A false police report and a murdered little girl.	N
421	00:24:50	00:24:52	So it's one to four for the Amber Alert.	N
422	00:24:52	00:24:59	And for your sister, life imprisonment if it's an accident, and the needle if it's not.	N
423	00:24:59	00:25:00	I didn't kill Alicia.	N
424	00:25:00	00:25:01	But you know, I get it.	N
425	00:25:01	00:25:02	I get the picture.	N
426	00:25:02	00:25:04	I mean, your brother's the center of attention.	N
427	00:25:04	00:25:06	He's sick, he's dying.	N
428	00:25:06	00:25:08	Your cells don't match.	N
429	00:25:08	00:25:10	Your parents have Alicia.	Y
430	00:25:10	00:25:12	She's his savior.	N
431	00:25:12	00:25:14	So, where do you fit in?	N
432	00:25:14	00:25:17	What are you to this family?	N
433	00:25:17	00:25:18	I'm invisible.	Y
434	00:25:18	00:25:20	But not anymore you're not.	Y
435	00:25:20	00:25:23	She's dead, and your brother's sick.	N
436	00:25:23	00:25:24	When he goes...	N
437	00:25:24	00:25:25	That's crazy, okay.	N
438	00:25:25	00:25:27	I told you, I didn't kill my sister.	N
439	00:25:27	00:25:30	I want to believe that.	N
440	00:25:30	00:25:32	Come on.	N
441	00:25:32	00:25:34	Help me to believe that.	N
442	00:25:34	00:25:37	It just means you were in on it because you put on one hell of a show.	N
443	00:25:37	00:25:38	You still using?	N
444	00:25:38	00:25:40	No.	N
445	00:25:40	00:25:43	Maybe we should run your blood just to be sure, huh?	N
446	00:25:43	00:25:45	I use now and then to take the edge off.	N
447	00:25:46	00:25:47	So how do you pay for this habit?	Y
448	00:25:47	00:25:49	Are you pimping your sister for drugs, April?	N
449	00:25:49	00:25:51	Why don't you make up your mind?	N
450	00:25:51	00:25:52	No signs of rape.	N
451	00:25:52	00:25:55	If I was selling my sister, there would be, wouldn't there?	N
452	00:25:55	00:25:57	Depends on who you sold it to.	N
453	00:25:59	00:26:02	You're not gonna talk your way out of this one.	N
454	00:26:02	00:26:04	You need to get clean.	N
455	00:26:04	00:26:08	What I need is a lawyer, which means this conversation is over.	N
456	00:26:09	00:26:16	Daniel Perez was diagnosed with relapsing acute promyelocytic leukemia or APL when he was ten.	N
457	00:26:16	00:26:20	It's rare, it's nasty, and it usually hits Hispanics.	N
458	00:26:20	00:26:24	His sister, Alicia was conceived in vitro to be a genetic match.	N
459	00:26:24	00:26:26	Well, it's not unheard of.	N
460	00:26:26	00:26:30	Have a baby, get the undeveloped stem cells from cord blood.	N
461	00:26:30	00:26:33	New parents are even storing it now.	N
462	00:26:33	00:26:36	But when she was four, they took her blood for a transfusion.	N
463	00:26:36	00:26:37	No... no!	N
464	00:26:37	00:26:39	It's all right, it's okay, sweetheart.	N
465	00:26:39	00:26:42	No... no!	N
466	00:26:42	00:26:45	At seven, they took her blood to remove stem cells.	N
467	00:26:49	00:26:54	Well, Daniel must have relapsed because they took bone marrow twice.	N
468	00:27:12	00:27:16	It takes one to one-and-a-half liters of marrow for a successful harvest.	N
469	00:27:16	00:27:18	A living DNA factory.	N
470	00:27:38	00:27:39	I don't need help.	N
471	00:27:39	00:27:40	I know.	N
472	00:27:40	00:27:44	I'm just trying to make the transition seamless.	N
473	00:27:45	00:27:46	Forget I'm here.	N
474	00:27:49	00:27:54	So would you like to grab a bite later?	N
475	00:27:54	00:27:56	I know a diner down the street that serves a mean liver and onions.	N
476	00:27:56	00:27:58	I don't eat out.	Y
477	00:27:58	00:27:59	Never ever?	Y
478	00:27:59	00:28:01	I don't like expectorant.	N
479	00:28:01	00:28:03	Really?	N
480	00:28:03	00:28:11	Kitchen staff talk while they prepare your food and then the wait staff repeats your order over the plate, and by the time you get your meal, there are several DNA samples coating it.	Y
481	00:28:11	00:28:13	Wow.	N
482	00:28:13	00:28:15	No, thank you.	N
483	00:28:17	00:28:19	I don't eat birthday cake either.	N
484	00:28:19	00:28:21	Oh, blowing out the candles.	N
485	00:28:21	00:28:22	Ugh. Don't get me started.	N
486	00:28:33	00:28:34	Excuse me.	N
487	00:28:36	00:28:40	Um... what happens to April now?	N
488	00:28:40	00:28:45	She is being charged and processed and the court will probably grant her bill.	Y
489	00:28:45	00:28:46	Do you know how much...?	N
490	00:28:46	00:28:47	Why?	N
491	00:28:47	00:28:49	She's my daughter.	N
492	00:28:49	00:28:52	She's refusing to talk about what happened to your youngest child, Mrs. Perez.	N
493	00:28:52	00:28:54	I can't leave her in jail.	N
494	00:28:54	00:28:55	I think it might be the best place for her.	N
495	00:28:56	00:28:58	This is my fault.	N
496	00:28:58	00:29:01	I... I was never there for her. I...	N
497	00:29:01	00:29:03	Why don't we step in here, please?	N
498	00:29:05	00:29:13	I spent all my energy getting Daniel to the next... thing-- the next pill, the next treatment, the next remission, hoping that this time...	N
499	00:29:13	00:29:21	And, uh... where did Alicia fit in, except for what she could give to your son?	N
500	00:29:21	00:29:24	You have no idea what it's like.	N
501	00:29:24	00:29:25	I saw her medical records.	N
502	00:29:25	00:29:26	I looked at her X rays.	N
503	00:29:26	00:29:28	I know what that little girl suffered, what you put her through.	N
504	00:29:28	00:29:31	So you would let your child die and do nothing.	N
505	00:29:31	00:29:33	Never.	N
506	00:29:33	00:29:36	No, you'd talk to doctors and research.	N
507	00:29:36	00:29:43	And then you'd find out that the National Bone Marrow Registry can't help you 'cause your son is mixed race.	N
508	00:29:43	00:29:46	And even if he wasn't, there aren't enough donors.	N
509	00:29:46	00:29:50	Out of four million, only 205,000 are Latino.	N
510	00:29:50	00:29:52	I did what I had to do.	N
511	00:29:52	00:29:55	You put one child over another.	N
512	00:29:55	00:29:57	I don't expect you to understand.	N
513	00:29:57	00:29:58	You don't have kids.	N
514	00:29:58	00:30:00	Uh, I have a daughter.	N
515	00:30:01	00:30:05	So, what kind of mother are you?	N
516	00:30:05	00:30:06	When do you see her?	N
517	00:30:06	00:30:08	You work nights.	N
518	00:30:08	00:30:10	You probably don't even know where she is half the time.	N
519	00:30:11	00:30:16	Alicia's life may not have been simple, but at least I knew her.	N
520	00:30:16	00:30:18	Can you say the same?	N
521	00:30:23	00:30:24	Where's Greg?	N
522	00:30:24	00:30:28	Helping, uh... Sara.	N
523	00:30:28	00:30:33	I need the tox results for Alicia Perez.	N
524	00:30:33	00:30:38	Still pending, but the blood on the mother's T-shirt matches the blood on the blanket.	N
525	00:30:38	00:30:39	Belongs to the victim.	N
526	00:30:39	00:30:40	Menstrual?	N
527	00:30:40	00:30:41	Negative.	N
528	00:30:43	00:30:49	Well, the volume of blood that was found on the blanket suggests injury or some kind of trauma.	N
529	00:30:49	00:30:50	Nevertheless...	N
530	00:30:52	00:30:53	I was very thorough.	N
531	00:30:56	00:30:59	Run it again, please.	N
532	00:31:02	00:31:05	Greg, you said you wanted to help out.	N
533	00:31:05	00:31:09	Well, yeah, with searching April's apartment, maybe finding the bad guy.	N
534	00:31:09	00:31:11	This counts as field work, you know?	N
535	00:31:11	00:31:14	Oh, I'm smiling on the inside.	N
536	00:31:14	00:31:17	Dirty laundry or garbage.	N
537	00:31:17	00:31:18	You know what?	N
538	00:31:18	00:31:20	You take the garbage.	N
539	00:31:20	00:31:21	Thanks.	N
540	00:31:38	00:31:39	Hmm.	N
541	00:31:40	00:31:42	April own a computer?	N
542	00:31:42	00:31:45	No. Why?	N
543	00:31:45	00:31:51	Well, she MapQuest the directions to the convenience store from the pedophile's address.	N
544	00:32:02	00:32:08	I already told you, Mom, I heard you. Can we go now?	N
545	00:32:08	00:32:16	No. You need to see for yourself why you can't ever hitchhike or go downtown or be careless with your safety.	N
546	00:32:16	00:32:18	Are you ready?	N
547	00:32:18	00:32:20	Just do it. I'm not scared.	N
548	00:32:30	00:32:34	She was waiting for a bus downtown when she was attacked.	Y
549	00:32:34	00:32:36	She's was 23.	N
550	00:32:36	00:32:39	She was taller and stronger than you, Lindsey.	N
551	00:32:39	00:32:41	She fought back and didn't win.	N
552	00:32:41	00:32:44	Someone's gonna have to tell her family.	N
553	00:32:44	00:32:46	Her parents are gonna have to see her like this.	N
554	00:32:49	00:32:50	Do you get it now?	N
555	00:32:56	00:33:00	Kids don't belong in the coroner's office unless they're in a drawer.	N
556	00:33:00	00:33:03	You should've found a different way to deal with your daughter's rebellion.	N
557	00:33:03	00:33:05	Well, with due respect, Doc, this doesn't concern you.	N
558	00:33:06	00:33:09	Ever notice how childhood keeps getting shorter and shorter?	N
559	00:33:09	00:33:10	Whose fault is that?	N
560	00:33:10	00:33:12	I honestly don't know!	N
561	00:33:17	00:33:20	We subpoenaed Map Quest-- they store each page on a different server.	N
562	00:33:20	00:33:23	All queries are saved for 72 hours, then they dump the core.	N
563	00:33:23	00:33:27	The suspect doesn't have a computer, but she could've gone to the library or used a service.	N
564	00:33:27	00:33:29	No, physical location doesn't matter.	N
565	00:33:29	00:33:30	What we do is a reversal process.	N
566	00:33:30	00:33:33	Using the Internet protocol number, we can get to the server.	N
567	00:33:33	00:33:36	Which will ultimately lead to the Internet account holder.	N
568	00:33:36	00:33:38	Right. We hunt for child pornographers the same way.	N
569	00:33:42	00:33:44	Who does the account belong to?	N
570	00:33:47	00:33:49	Sybil Perez.	N
571	00:33:50	00:33:52	Mr. and Mrs. Perez... What's going on?	Y
572	00:33:52	00:33:55	I'll tell you on the way to the police station-- where's your son?	N
573	00:33:55	00:33:57	At church. Why?	N
574	00:33:57	00:33:58	Let's go.	N
575	00:35:13	00:35:19	Daniel Perez is taking Oxycodone for pain, and Alicia was on Diazepam.	N
576	00:35:19	00:35:23	Diazepam? That's a pretty hard-core antidepressant for a kid that small.	N
577	00:35:23	00:35:27	I guess they didn't want her complaining while they were mining her body for healthy cells.	N
578	00:35:27	00:35:28	You think they didn't care about her?	N
579	00:35:28	00:35:33	I don't know. Well, it must've been hard, trying to keep their son alive, keep the family together.	N
580	00:35:33	00:35:34	Couldn't have been easy.	N
581	00:35:34	00:35:35	It wasn't for Alicia.	N
582	00:35:37	00:35:38	Did you find anything?	N
583	00:35:38	00:35:41	Yeah. Blue fibers.	N
584	00:35:41	00:35:43	I take it you qualified at the range.	N
585	00:35:43	00:35:44	You take it right.	N
586	00:35:44	00:35:46	What'd you shoot?	N
587	00:35:46	00:35:48	260 out of 300.	N
588	00:35:48	00:35:52	225's passing, which, I believe, was your high score.	N
589	00:35:52	00:35:54	( laughs ) Where are you doing?	N
590	00:35:54	00:35:56	Well, this is Dad's car.	N
591	00:35:56	00:35:59	You ever see those guys out in the street, with the scope, measuring distances?	N
592	00:35:59	00:36:03	Always thought they were nuts for standing out in traffic, but...	Y
593	00:36:06	00:36:08	Look familiar?	Y
594	00:36:11	00:36:14	Looks like the lividity marks on Alicia's body.	N
595	00:36:14	00:36:16	I don't get you, man.	N
596	00:36:16	00:36:26	I mean, even if you could explain it, I would never understand how you could stuff your daughter in the trunk of your car and dump her body in the woods!	Y
597	00:36:26	00:36:27	I had to protect my family.	N
598	00:36:27	00:36:29	Wasn't Alicia part of your family?	N
599	00:36:30	00:36:33	You're her father, you dumb bastard!	N
600	00:36:33	00:36:35	You're supposed to protect her.	N
601	00:36:37	00:36:39	What kind of man are you?	N
602	00:36:39	00:36:41	Guilty.	N
603	00:36:43	00:36:47	You know, we got enough evidence to charge you with premeditated murder.	N
604	00:36:47	00:36:49	You don't have any proof I killed my daughter.	N
605	00:36:49	00:36:51	You helped your husband move the body.	N
606	00:36:51	00:36:55	You know, I really don't see him taking her underpants off, so that job was left to you.	N
607	00:36:55	00:37:01	Then you or your daughter, April, checked the sex offenders' registry, and you tried to frame an innocent man.	N
608	00:37:01	00:37:03	Innocent?	N
609	00:37:03	00:37:06	You trying to make me believe you really give a damn about a pedophile? Please.	N
610	00:37:06	00:37:08	Forget about that; this is about you.	N
611	00:37:08	00:37:09	You're the tough one.	N
612	00:37:09	00:37:11	You run the house. You run the family.	N
613	00:37:11	00:37:12	People do what you say in a crisis.	N
614	00:37:12	00:37:14	So?	N
615	00:37:14	00:37:15	So this time Alicia said no.	N
616	00:37:15	00:37:20	She wanted to keep her kidney, and that pissed you off.	N
617	00:37:20	00:37:21	So you killed her.	N
618	00:37:21	00:37:23	That's ridiculous.	N
619	00:37:23	00:37:27	She was angry-- she wanted to play on the soccer team, she wanted a life.	N
620	00:37:27	00:37:29	Alicia got angry, sometimes.	N
621	00:37:29	00:37:31	Just sick of it. We all did.	N
622	00:37:31	00:37:37	But she'd have been devastated if Daniel had died and she did nothing to prevent it.	N
623	00:37:37	00:37:39	She loved her brother.	N
624	00:37:39	00:37:42	And you're just the type of woman that would never let her forget it.	N
625	00:37:44	00:37:49	Come on, Alicia wanted out of this game, and you couldn't let that happen.	N
626	00:37:49	00:37:53	Not to Daniel, not to your only son, your favorite child.	N
627	00:37:53	00:37:58	You slipped Alicia some of Daniel's Oxycodone.	Y
628	00:38:01	00:38:04	Alicia? Time for your pills.	Y
629	00:38:08	00:38:12	So now you got a problem-- you had a dead body in the house and no plausible explanation.	Y
630	00:38:12	00:38:14	What are you gonna do?	N
631	00:38:14	00:38:16	So you call your daughter April.	N
632	00:38:16	00:38:20	You make up a story, you play your roles, and put on a show.	N
633	00:38:20	00:38:24	Wait. We have to do this right.	Y
634	00:38:28	00:38:33	Oh, you know, I-I thought the, uh, the slap was a nice touch.	N
635	00:38:35	00:38:36	I have a confirmation.	Y
636	00:38:36	00:38:41	Those blue fibers are consistent with the blanket that the girl was wrapped in.	Y
637	00:38:41	00:38:46	And the shoe prints that I found at the scene they're a match to the father's work boots.	Y
638	00:38:46	00:38:48	I retested the T-shirt and the blanket.	N
639	00:38:48	00:38:51	The blood still matches Alicia Perez.	Y
640	00:38:51	00:38:56	The evidence supports this unless you'd like to second-guess that also.	Y
641	00:38:57	00:39:00	I just expect things to be done correctly, Greg.	N
642	00:39:00	00:39:02	We all have to learn how to accept change.	N
643	00:39:02	00:39:04	Mia's doing a great job.	N
644	00:39:04	00:39:07	It would be nice if someone other than me said so.	Y
645	00:39:07	00:39:09	You're right.	N
646	00:39:10	00:39:11	What about the handkerchief?	N
647	00:39:11	00:39:13	I compared that to the other blood evidence.	N
648	00:39:13	00:39:17	It's also match to the victim.	Y
649	00:39:44	00:39:48	I didn't realize until... today...	Y
650	00:39:50	00:39:55	...how lucky I am.	Y
651	00:39:55	00:40:00	I know pretty much... how and when I'm gonna die.	N
652	00:40:02	00:40:04	Most people don't.	N
653	00:40:05	00:40:08	It's what they're afraid of.	Y
654	00:40:10	00:40:12	Was your sister afraid?	Y
655	00:40:14	00:40:16	Never.	N
656	00:40:19	00:40:23	I'm 11 years older than her, and she took care of me.	Y
657	00:40:26	00:40:29	She was my best friend, and I miss her.	N
658	00:40:36	00:40:38	As much pain as...	Y
659	00:40:38	00:40:42	I caused her...	Y
660	00:40:42	00:40:49	and she wouldn't give up, and she... she wouldn't let me, either.	Y
661	00:40:49	00:40:53	That's why...	Y
662	00:40:53	00:40:59	during the last relapse, I made my parents swear that it was the very last time.	Y
663	00:40:59	00:41:02	But then your kidneys failed, and they broke their word, huh?	N
664	00:41:02	00:41:10	They told me they... swore not to fight the cancer, so this didn't count.	N
665	00:41:12	00:41:15	I wasn't gonna lose this fight.	N
666	00:41:22	00:41:26	Oh, my God! Please...	Y
667	00:41:26	00:41:27	We have to call the police.	N
668	00:41:28	00:41:29	They'll put him in prison.	N
669	00:41:29	00:41:32	I couldn't watch her suffer anymore.	N
670	00:41:32	00:41:35	This wasn't a mercy killing, Daniel.	N
671	00:41:35	00:41:37	This was an execution.	N
672	00:41:40	00:41:43	Bone marrow, transfusions...	N
673	00:41:43	00:41:45	That's her blood in your veins.	N
674	00:41:52	00:41:56	It dripped out of your nose onto the blanket while you were killing her.	N
675	00:41:59	00:42:04	If you cared so much for Alicia, why didn't you take your own life instead of hers?	N
676	00:42:04	00:42:08	Suicide isn't an option.	N
677	00:42:08	00:42:11	It's an unforgivable sin in the eyes of God.	N
678	00:42:11	00:42:15	But you believe your God forgives murder?	N
679	00:42:15	00:42:19	If that's your defense, it won't keep you out of jail.	N
680	00:42:21	00:42:24	But my death will.	N
681	00:42:25	00:42:30	See, I've got about six more months.	N
682	00:42:30	00:42:33	I'll be dead before there's even a trial.	N
683	00:42:40	00:42:43	I-I do want to thank you, though.	N
684	00:42:43	00:42:44	For what?	N
685	00:42:44	00:42:47	For speaking for Alicia.	N
686	00:42:48	00:42:52	You're probably the first person in her life to think only of her.	N
687	00:42:54	00:43:00	You know, you may not believe in God, sir, but you do His work.	N
