280	michaelclark	N	00:22:30.744
281	but can we place him dead at the house	N	00:22:32.634
282	greg what else can you tell us about that hair	N	00:22:34.960
283	you mean hairs	N	00:22:36.796
284	there were two	N	00:22:37.752
285	ancillary maybe arm or leg hair	N	00:22:39.694
286	found it in the tub drain	N	00:22:41.895
287	the avatar of choice for dismemberments	N	00:22:44.514
288	according to jacqui there were no prints found on the scalpel blades or handle	N	00:22:48.249
289	but the blood 's a match to both victims	N	00:22:51.215
290	so michaelclark was dead in the tub	N	00:22:53.834
291	we just do n't know how he got there	N	00:22:55.382
292	well i km 'd the carpet at the threshold of the bathroom	N	00:22:56.344
293	it 's negative for blood	N	00:22:58.154
294	so all the violence took place in the bathroom at least anything that had to do with blood	N	00:23:00.930
295	the bathroom is big but it 's not big enough to kill two at the same time	N	00:23:05.194
296	she lights the candles in the shower	N	00:23:08.647
297	her back is to the door	N	00:23:10.581
298	he grabs her from behind	Y	00:23:14.614
299	and slits her throat	N	00:23:16.854
300	then he positions her body	Y	00:23:22.315
301	so that her face is the first thing the boyfriend sees when he walks in	N	00:23:25.235
302	so he takes seconds to kill debbie	Y	00:23:30.934
303	so why does he spend so much time cutting up michaelclark	Y	00:23:33.714
304	most likely because michaelclark was the real focus of his rage	Y	00:23:35.955
305	do n't tell me you never went home	N	00:24:23.315
306	okay	N	00:24:26.195
307	i just got started in here	N	00:24:27.964
308	have n't even gotten to the other rooms yet	N	00:24:29.734
309	you know you lose your edge after sixteen hours	N	00:24:31.727
310	you 're into your third shift	N	00:24:33.742
311	i mean i 'm all for overtime but this is just plain greedy	N	00:24:36.314
312	my knees ca n't take this anymore	N	00:24:39.975
313	have you eaten anything	N	00:24:41.846
314	what did you bring	N	00:24:43.461
315	i 'll see what 's in the fridge	N	00:24:46.294
316	we have to replace that you know	N	00:24:51.394
317	hey black lung	N	00:25:25.075
318	ha ha	N	00:25:26.815
319	i 've been sifting through this trash for about six hours	N	00:25:28.747
320	you coming to rescue me or make fun of me	N	00:25:30.801
321	i am just looking	N	00:25:32.974
322	relax	N	00:25:35.734
323	what are these white fibers here	N	00:25:36.576
324	they must be from the spare bedroom because all the other carpets are green	N	00:25:40.674
325	spare bedroom was n't on his entrance or exit path	Y	00:25:44.816
326	look all i know is that they were near the top of the bag so it must have been one of the last things he vacuumed	Y	00:25:47.014
327	i did happen to find this butterfly pendant with some white fibers on it	N	00:25:53.394
328	it looks like a necklace or a bracelet and it has this link that snaps so i 'm thinking sign of struggle	N	00:25:59.374
329	the killer was in that spare bedroom	Y	00:26:05.309
330	feel better	N	00:26:15.335
331	well now that we fed you we should probably talk about a shower	N	00:26:21.009
332	i mean at your place	N	00:26:24.666
333	you need to go home	N	00:26:25.842
334	as soon as we find some evidence i promise	N	00:26:27.834
335	with fresh eyes you wo n't miss it	N	00:26:30.355
336	just talk it through with me will you	N	00:26:36.276
337	what do we know	N	00:26:37.791
338	all right	N	00:26:40.435
339	the bathroom is where things got started candles oils steam shower cleaned up oiled up sexed up	N	00:26:45.055
340	let 's go back to the bedroom	N	00:26:55.275
341	no nothing on this sheet	N	00:27:03.595
342	she changed her sheets for her date i would	N	00:27:16.654
343	hey cath	N	00:27:28.814
344	got silk	N	00:27:31.614
345	why yes i do	N	00:27:40.174
346	i do n't mean to embarrass you but um	N	00:27:46.194
347	some guys need leverage	N	00:27:49.814
348	they do	N	00:27:54.274
349	i 'll dust for prints	N	00:27:55.464
350	grissom	N	00:28:01.106
351	it 's warrick	N	00:28:02.601
352	i have something for you	N	00:28:04.287
353	i found a butterfly link with some white fibers on it	N	00:28:05.981
354	butterfly	N	00:28:07.657
355	where	N	00:28:09.131
356	in the vacuum bag	N	00:28:09.937
357	you check all the rooms	N	00:28:10.545
358	i have n't checked the spare bedroom	N	00:28:11.715
359	let me look again and i 'll call you back	N	00:28:12.885
360	all right	N	00:28:15.294
361	hang one	N	00:29:20.034
362	toe print	N	00:29:21.614
363	i 'll have sara compare it against both victims	N	00:29:23.227
364	good	N	00:29:24.801
365	warrick found a butterfly charm in the vacuum bag	N	00:29:27.094
366	i think i just found a piece from the same chain in this box	N	00:29:30.935
367	butterfly huh	N	00:29:34.215
368	she had a collection	N	00:29:36.394
369	gifts from her gentlemen callers	N	00:29:39.274
370	maybe the killer was taking his gift back as in leave no trace	Y	00:29:43.114
371	maybe he finally ran out of patience and got sloppy	Y	00:29:46.714
372	and this is why i did n't leave	N	00:30:06.614
373	hey you seen grissom	N	00:31:08.767
374	he 's still at the crime scene	N	00:31:10.461
375	i eliminated both victims from the print you pulled off the bed	N	00:31:13.170
376	well we know she was fishing off the company pier	N	00:31:16.594
377	you uh seen debbie	N	00:31:20.734
378	yeah	N	00:31:22.155
379	and	N	00:31:23.394
380	yeah i compared her toe prints	N	00:31:25.334
381	if i did n't know better i 'd think that was you on that table	N	00:31:27.935
382	i did n't really look at her face	N	00:31:30.549
383	when you see grissom will you tell him	N	00:31:35.354
384	oh that feels nice	N	00:31:42.587
385	do you have something to take this off	N	00:31:43.921
386	just step on the card please	N	00:31:45.575
387	good thing you caught me early in the shift	N	00:31:47.894
388	yeah lucky for me	N	00:31:50.446
389	i think i could probably tell who pulled a double	N	00:31:52.701
390	listen i 've got a patient waiting in pre-op	N	00:31:55.014
391	we 'll have you out in a minute	N	00:31:57.367
392	we appreciate you providing your prints voluntarily	N	00:31:59.701
393	well there 's probably a little bit of a lot of us in debbie 's house	N	00:32:05.734
394	oh we 'll know soon enough	N	00:32:08.315
395	thank you	N	00:32:12.214
396	you understand right	N	00:32:13.754
397	the police are n't the only ones with a code of honor	N	00:32:16.114
398	now some of these men are married and if this gets out	N	00:32:19.450
399	nothing gets out unless it needs to get out	N	00:32:22.634
400	got a match	N	00:32:25.514
401	dr tripton	N	00:32:31.834
402	i 'm afraid your patient in pre-op is going to have to wait a little while longer	N	00:32:35.450
403	do n't really know why i 'm here	N	00:32:45.455
404	your toe print was found in debbiemarlin 's house	N	00:32:48.514
405	same house she was murdered in	N	00:32:50.935
406	her car was in the shop and i gave her a ride home one night and she invited me in for a cup of coffee	N	00:32:55.534
407	she did n't like anyone wearing shoes in the house	N	00:32:59.415
408	some feng shui thing	N	00:33:01.925
409	so you feng shui-ed your way to the bed	N	00:33:04.414
410	she was provocative	N	00:33:08.187
411	you take your coat off she has her clothes off	N	00:33:10.162
412	she came on to me	N	00:33:14.434
413	come on doc let 's do it	N	00:33:16.494
414	take a look	N	00:33:21.894
415	all right well let 's talk about what 's not open to interpretation	N	00:33:30.194
416	yours were the only prints found in the house	N	00:33:33.349
417	michaelclark was on your rotation he was on your surgical team the day he was killed	N	00:33:37.055
418	you called in sick	N	00:33:40.134
419	surgery was cancelled	N	00:33:41.364
420	freed him up to be with debbie who also had the day off	N	00:33:43.016
421	what luck	N	00:33:44.891
422	my son had a ball game	N	00:33:46.637
423	my daughter was at a swim meet	N	00:33:48.071
424	my wife was at a conference and the surgery was elective	N	00:33:49.947
425	not a stretch	N	00:33:52.082
426	your wife know about you and debbie	N	00:33:53.987
427	no	N	00:33:55.482
428	she asked for sex right	N	00:33:57.166
429	she also asked for the bracelet too huh	N	00:33:58.862
430	no but	N	00:34:01.806
431	i gave it to her	N	00:34:03.181
432	this one	N	00:34:05.634
433	she loved butterflies	N	00:34:08.105
434	uh i figured if i gave something special to her she 'd give something special to me	N	00:34:09.995
435	hmm	N	00:34:13.095
436	so it was a long-term relationship	N	00:34:16.454
437	that 's the hair from the spare bedroom	N	00:34:21.954
438	there 's an oily film on the surface of the hair	N	00:34:26.495
439	propylene glycol	N	00:34:28.775
440	active ingredient in rogaine for male pattern baldness	N	00:34:31.594
441	personally i do n't use the stuff but my grandfather papaolaf he was bruce willis at age 16	N	00:34:36.315
442	lucky for me baldness comes from the mother 's side so i 'm safe	N	00:34:40.534
443	greg please i 'm very tired	N	00:34:43.055
444	well maybe the guy we 're looking for is going bald or trying not to	N	00:34:46.610
445	according to papaolaf a lot of guys who use rogaine also use propecia kind of like a cocktail	N	00:34:51.535
446	i ran the hair through massspec	N	00:34:55.946
447	i got four peaks ethyl alcohol propylene glycol minoxidil and finasteride	N	00:34:59.521
448	finasteride the chemical name for propecia	N	00:35:04.394
449	but wait there 's more and it 's a family secret	N	00:35:06.775
450	sexual	N	00:35:08.747
451	happens in less than two percent of users	N	00:35:09.862
452	papaolaf was one of those guys that needed hydraulics	N	00:35:12.894
453	oh	N	00:35:20.737
454	the prodigal csi returns	N	00:35:24.175
455	you get any sleep	N	00:35:26.266
456	not yet	N	00:35:27.601
457	so uh brass had to let dr tripton go	N	00:35:29.735
458	the old sex alibi	N	00:35:32.045
459	too bad he did n't leave a toe print on a scalpel blade	N	00:35:34.494
460	you got a take on him	N	00:35:36.796
461	balloon head but credible like most adulterers	N	00:35:38.231
462	is he going bald	N	00:35:41.354
463	not really	N	00:35:42.544
464	grey hair	N	00:35:43.717
465	no	N	00:35:44.691
466	anything else	N	00:35:48.157
467	he 's a lefty	N	00:35:49.131
468	okay keep in mind this is just a theory	N	00:35:51.614
469	it 's a hot button issue among forensic pathologists	N	00:35:54.135
470	what 's the consensus	N	00:35:56.394
471	most doctors say it 's impossible to prove handedness based on the wounds inflicted on a victim	N	00:36:00.034
472	forget hard science	N	00:36:03.520
473	what 's your hypothesis	N	00:36:04.800
474	based on micro-incisions and hesitation marks the victim was lying face up when he was killed	N	00:36:08.354
475	take a look at the right knee	N	00:36:12.255
476	the cut on the cartilage of the right distal femur has slight angulations from the uh left distal to the right proximal which suggests the killer was left-handed	Y	00:36:19.814
477	this angulation is consistent with cuts made to the acetabulum and to the wrist but bear in mind it 's not going to be admissible in court	N	00:36:29.235
478	i do n't care about court	N	00:36:34.134
479	my mind 's on a left-handed propecia-using surgeon who 's probably on staff at desert palm	Y	00:36:38.825
480	there was no need for the light show	N	00:37:13.364
481	all you had to do was ask	N	00:37:15.134
482	good	N	00:37:16.854
483	since we 're being completely honest are you losing your hair	Y	00:37:19.684
484	i 'm a 48-year-old man	Y	00:37:22.427
485	i 'm not unique	Y	00:37:23.681
486	your hair is though	Y	00:37:25.834
487	we found it at the crime scene	N	00:37:28.814
488	minoxidil absorbs infrared light	N	00:37:32.094
489	i-i take rogaine and propecia	Y	00:37:36.735
490	again not unique	N	00:37:38.695
491	well we think that debbiemarlin and michaelclark were killed by a surgeon who is left-handed	Y	00:37:42.210
492	and we know of two left-handed surgeons at desert palm dr tripton who has an alibi and you	Y	00:37:47.210
493	well if you 're going to make accusations you should really do your homework	N	00:37:52.894
494	howard and i are the only lefties on staff	Y	00:37:56.174
495	dr randolph who has privileges at the hospital he 's also a lefty	N	00:37:59.674
496	we play tennis every wednesday	Y	00:38:02.127
497	he 's got a heck of a back-hand	N	00:38:03.661
498	if you want me to name more names i could but you do n't want me to do your job for you do you	Y	00:38:09.049
499	gentlemen we 're here as a courtesy so if you 're quite through wasting our time i think that the doctor would like to get back to the business of saving lives	Y	00:38:16.095
500	not so fast	N	00:38:21.287
501	is this a link from a bracelet you gave debbie	Y	00:38:23.222
502	mm-hmm	N	00:38:26.470
503	it looks like it	N	00:38:27.869
504	where 's the rest of it	N	00:38:29.149
505	this link was vacuumed from the floor of the spare bedroom after the murder	N	00:38:31.656
506	the other link was in her jewelry box	N	00:38:33.851
507	the funny thing is that all the bracelets from the other guys she slept with are intact	N	00:38:37.654
508	well all i can tell you is when i gave it to her it was in one piece	Y	00:38:44.114
509	do you have any other evidence	N	00:38:55.695
510	no we do n't	N	00:38:59.314
511	we might not have any other evidence but we have a theory	N	00:39:01.594
512	that 's not admissible in court	N	00:39:04.174
513	oh no no it 's worth a listen	N	00:39:06.394
514	we think you killed debbiemarlin because she rejected you and michaelclark paid the price	Y	00:39:15.210
515	thank you for your time and your theories but you said it yourself you do n't have a case	N	00:39:25.514
516	doctor	Y	00:39:30.124
517	it 's sad is n't it doc	Y	00:39:37.355
518	guys like us	Y	00:39:40.155
519	couple of middle-aged men who 've allowed their work to consume their lives	Y	00:39:44.864
520	the only time we ever touch other people is when we 're wearing our latex gloves	Y	00:39:51.454
521	we wake up one day and realize that for fifty years we have n't really lived at all	Y	00:39:57.774
522	but then all of a sudden we get a second chance	Y	00:40:05.215
523	somebody young and beautiful shows up	N	00:40:11.807
524	somebody	N	00:40:14.081
525	we could care about	Y	00:40:16.861
526	she offers us a new life with her but we have a big decision to make right	Y	00:40:20.410
527	because we have to risk everything we 've worked for in order to have her	Y	00:40:26.414
528	i could n't do it	N	00:40:33.735
529	but you did	Y	00:40:37.255
530	you risked it all	Y	00:40:41.374
531	and she showed you a wonderful life did n't she	Y	00:40:45.005
532	but then she took it away and gave it to somebody else	N	00:40:52.874
533	and you were lost	Y	00:40:55.295
534	so you took her life	Y	00:41:00.675
535	debbie it 's me michael	N	00:41:08.974
536	debbie	N	00:41:11.794
537	you killed them both and now you have nothing	Y	00:41:14.774
538	i 'm still here	Y	00:41:21.984
539	are you	Y	00:41:24.955
