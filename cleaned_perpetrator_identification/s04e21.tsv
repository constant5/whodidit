230	zack you close up shop at the sphinx at night	Y	00:17:54.374
231	yeah monday to friday	N	00:17:57.229
232	uh class till 3:00	N	00:17:59.244
233	tutor kids in math till 5:00 and then i head over to the park	Y	00:18:00.774
234	we close at 10:00	Y	00:18:02.304
235	did you notice any cars in the parking lot after closing on thursday night	Y	00:18:05.815
236	jimmynevins	N	00:18:09.230
237	his red t-bird was out there	N	00:18:10.573
238	oh you know jimmy	Y	00:18:11.916
239	yeah sure pretty cool guy	N	00:18:13.407
240	worked the bumper cars	N	00:18:14.861
241	i still ca n't believe what happened you know	Y	00:18:17.764
242	i mean i must have rode that coaster like phew a hundred times maybe more	Y	00:18:21.114
243	anyway sometimes jimmy stayed after closing	N	00:18:24.774
244	why	N	00:18:26.744
245	look i 'm not trying to get anybody in trouble but occasionally jimmy would take his dates for rides on the fever you know	Y	00:18:30.935
246	everybody knew about it	N	00:18:34.937
247	it was really no big deal	N	00:18:35.851
248	do you happen to know the name of his date on thursday night	Y	00:18:37.655
249	no sorry	N	00:18:39.975
250	how did jimmy get access to the park	N	00:18:42.196
251	i mean all the power is shut down at night	N	00:18:44.512
252	the same key that opens up the men 's room door opens up all the power boxes at the park	N	00:18:48.054
253	no kidding	N	00:18:51.047
254	it 's just hanging outside woody 's office	N	00:18:52.261
255	what about security	N	00:18:53.498
256	nope	N	00:18:54.574
257	night guy got laid off	N	00:18:55.651
258	budget cuts last winter	N	00:18:57.234
259	it 's not like anybody 's going break into an amusement park and steal a coaster you know	N	00:19:00.454
260	oh i am the man	N	00:20:45.615
261	are you	N	00:20:48.289
262	i microsilled the pipe wrenches you and sara turned into evidence	N	00:20:51.195
263	i excluded woody 's wrench	N	00:20:53.834
264	take a look at the tool marks from the wrench found in the t-bird	N	00:20:56.674
265	on the left the sabotaged nut	N	00:20:59.127
266	on the right the test marks	N	00:21:00.502
267	perfect match	N	00:21:03.234
268	i have a theory maybe jimnevins sabotaged the roller coaster	N	00:21:09.574
269	when he left the park someone attacked him grabbed his wrench and hit him over the head with it	Y	00:21:16.539
270	did you any prints off the wrench	N	00:21:26.226
271	i got a partial	N	00:21:27.562
272	and i had a tech print the t-bird	N	00:21:29.146
273	found two sets of prints on the trunk 's lid	N	00:21:30.802
274	one belonged to the vic the other unknown but it did match the partial	N	00:21:33.735
275	that semen from the coaster 's cab was just processed in my lab	N	00:21:41.289
276	all i can say is nevins was a cad	N	00:21:44.274
277	semen match the dead guy s	N	00:21:46.776
278	yup	N	00:21:47.631
279	and sara spoke to brass who says nevins was known for taking girls on private rides	N	00:21:50.575
280	pharaoh 's fever was his spanish fly	N	00:21:53.994
281	well there goes my theory	N	00:21:56.355
282	no one tampers with their sex machine	N	00:21:58.854
283	multitrack digital camera snaps photos of all the passengers	N	00:22:06.874
284	the park finally sent over their computer so i 'm scanning through the day of the accident	N	00:22:10.315
285	can you go back in time to the night before	N	00:22:13.294
286	yeah	N	00:22:14.907
287	why	N	00:22:15.841
288	jimnevins may have been on that coaster	N	00:22:17.547
289	i want to see if anyone was with him	N	00:22:19.842
290	oh	N	00:22:26.129

293	reverse one more pic	N	00:22:30.935
294	now that picture 's worth five bucks	N	00:22:37.314
295	last time stamp of the night was 12:45 a.m coroner placed nevins t.o.d at 1:00 a.m	N	00:22:41.315
296	we need to find that girl	N	00:22:45.214
297	oh roller coaster wacko at 12:00	N	00:23:44.794

316	i had no idea those cameras worked at night	N	00:24:44.914
317	is your name really cleopatra	N	00:24:47.234
318	lisa	N	00:24:48.834
319	lisa hunt	N	00:24:50.024
320	lisa you know your friend in this photograph is dead right	N	00:24:52.735
321	right	N	00:24:55.354
322	you do n't seem too upset about that	N	00:24:57.894
323	d.l	N	00:25:00.575
324	on jimmynevins four years ago when i was a frosh and he was a senior he was my jordan catalano	N	00:25:03.854
325	know what i mean	N	00:25:06.934
326	but he did n't know my name	N	00:25:08.734
327	so four years later when i started working here he 's still working here total loser but still really hot so when he asked me out there was only one answer when and where	N	00:25:12.675
328	after hours at the roller coaster	N	00:25:21.194
329	i know i thought the same thing cheez whiz	N	00:25:23.589
330	but i mean what the hell	N	00:25:26.535
331	i 'd never done it on a roller coaster	N	00:25:29.274
332	it was your first date	N	00:25:31.315
333	you sound like my mother	N	00:25:33.334
334	oh god you 're not going to tell her are you	N	00:25:36.234
335	i just turned eighteen	N	00:25:37.927
336	there is nothing statutory about it i swear	N	00:25:39.381
337	lisa we need to know what the two of you did when you got off the ride	N	00:25:42.475
338	we talked	N	00:25:45.674
339	i mean not that he had much to say	N	00:25:47.774
340	he offered to drive me home but i only live a few blocks from here so i told him i 'd huff it	N	00:25:52.514
341	mm we kissed way too much slobber	N	00:25:57.275
342	and that was it	N	00:25:59.654
343	was there anyone else around	N	00:26:01.395
344	i-i did n't see anybody but i was n't really looking	N	00:26:03.894
345	i 've got a question for you	N	00:27:35.954
346	what substance contains the following ingredients sorbitol cetyl alcohol isopropyl myristate glyceryl stearate peg-100 stearate petrolatum benzylalcohol titanium dioxide and purified water	N	00:27:43.095
347	okay i assume that you 've identified the substance we found on the roller coaster track	N	00:27:50.954
348	correct	N	00:27:53.155
349	it 's doxepin ointment	N	00:27:55.894
350	sounds klingon huh	N	00:27:58.254
351	anyway uh it 's prescribed by doctors to treat dermatological inflammations caused by contact with certain types of plants	N	00:28:04.129
352	maybe whoever messed with the tracks transferred the ointment when they loosened the wheels	N	00:28:09.770
353	your killer has a rash	N	00:28:16.155
354	and we need to catch it	N	00:28:18.654
355	i just got the court order from the pharmaceutical database	N	00:34:26.394
356	fortunately dioxipin is n't widely prescribed	N	00:34:29.134
357	fda only approved it two years ago and most dermatologists do n't even know what it is	N	00:34:32.334
358	how many names on the list	N	00:34:36.054
359	well in clark county twelve prescriptions were filled	N	00:34:38.295
360	i cross-referenced them with the employees from the park and i got a hit	Y	00:34:41.354
361	you want a clue	N	00:34:44.594
362	her death ended the ptolemy dynasty 's reign in ancient egypt hence making her the last pharaoh	N	00:34:47.704
363	ah the lovely cleopatra	N	00:34:51.404
364	i had a rash	N	00:34:54.077
365	so what	N	00:34:55.033
366	that 's not a crime	N	00:34:55.990
367	i read the court order	N	00:34:57.169
368	uh you found trace amounts of some ointment on the roller coaster tracks	N	00:34:59.475
369	is that the only reason for this conversation	N	00:35:03.456
370	your client had a prescription for doxepin may we see your arms please	N	00:35:08.051
371	rash was on my legs	N	00:35:12.357
372	went away days ago	N	00:35:13.311
373	you want to see	N	00:35:14.594
374	uh that 's okay	N	00:35:16.055
375	unless you want to argue that my client stood on her head and held a wrench in her toes we 're done here	N	00:35:19.034
376	do you know how you contracted the rash lisa	N	00:35:22.435
377	best guess i was getting some help with my homework	N	00:35:25.449
378	we were studying outside on the grass	Y	00:35:28.255
379	took a break went for a walk	N	00:35:30.065
380	i think i brushed up against something	N	00:35:32.134
381	who 's we	Y	00:35:33.995
382	my math tutor	Y	00:35:35.395
383	and what 's his name	Y	00:35:36.854
384	zacklawrence	Y	00:35:38.384
385	do you know if he contracted the rash as well	Y	00:35:44.226
386	yeah	N	00:35:45.562
387	actually i gave him some of my ointment	Y	00:35:47.394
388	hey zack	Y	00:35:53.614
389	oh hey guys	N	00:35:55.517
390	we spoke with lisa	N	00:35:57.211
391	she said she gave you some ointment for some nasty rash you have	Y	00:35:59.714
392	yeah yeah	N	00:36:02.055
393	you know it 's illegal to use someone else 's prescription medications	Y	00:36:04.154
394	is that why you guys are here	N	00:36:06.276
395	not exactly	N	00:36:07.711
396	um you guys mind if we talk about this somewhere else	Y	00:36:11.334
397	hey good idea	N	00:36:13.035
398	why do n't we go downtown	Y	00:36:13.765
399	we can talk there	Y	00:36:14.495
400	come on	N	00:36:16.234
401	come on	N	00:36:16.234
402	all right	N	00:36:18.068
403	you coming	N	00:36:21.074
404	you know i 'm going to catch up	N	00:36:23.334
405	okay	N	00:36:24.664
406	yeah it 's uh just a little bit of a rash	N	00:36:52.757
407	it 's really no big deal	N	00:36:54.352
408	zack what do you have against roller coasters	Y	00:36:56.684
409	what do	N	00:36:58.881
410	i-i do n't understand	Y	00:37:00.184
411	this a fingerprint analysis	N	00:37:01.487
412	zack i lifted some fingerprints off your broom back at the park	Y	00:37:03.884
413	turns out they 're a match to prints that we lifted off of jimnevins t-bird and the wrench that was used to kill him	N	00:37:07.434
414	circumstantial evidence at best	N	00:37:11.074
415	i also talked to your school principal	Y	00:37:13.594
416	you 're a straight a student mathalete	Y	00:37:15.165
417	science team	N	00:37:16.775
418	you had a full ride to stanford next year	Y	00:37:18.385
419	you do n't sound like the kind of kid that would mess with a roller coaster just for kicks	Y	00:37:21.594
420	you 're a smart guy zack	Y	00:37:26.364
421	so uh let 's talk this out logically	N	00:37:30.295
422	according to your previous statement when you locked up on thursday night jimnevins car was the only one in the parking lot right	Y	00:37:36.495
423	yes sir that 's correct	N	00:37:42.214
424	and you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster	Y	00:37:44.854
425	i do n't care about jimnevins	Y	00:37:47.720
426	what about lisa hunt	N	00:37:50.054
427	you tutor her right	Y	00:37:53.454
428	did lisa tell you that she had a date with jim	N	00:37:55.964
429	no she did n't say anything	N	00:37:57.734
430	it was all over the park	N	00:38:00.654
431	jim was going to take lisa on one of his coaster dates	N	00:38:03.335
432	i asked her about it	Y	00:38:07.245
433	she said it was a rumor	N	00:38:09.237
434	it seems to matter to you that she had a date with jim	Y	00:38:10.991
435	lady i make 20 an hour tutoring	Y	00:38:13.914
436	why do you think i 'd take minimum wage at the sphinx	Y	00:38:17.174
437	i 'm thinking you want lisa to see you away from the textbooks	Y	00:38:22.454
438	we started hanging out at breaks	Y	00:38:25.000
439	having dinner	N	00:38:27.494
440	and then last week after tutoring we went for a walk	Y	00:38:30.727
441	and she grabbed my hand	Y	00:38:33.541
442	did you think that meant something	Y	00:38:36.835
443	of course	N	00:38:39.367
444	but you did n't trust her	Y	00:38:40.341
445	no	N	00:38:43.534
446	i wanted to	Y	00:38:46.774
447	you tampered with the screws	Y	00:39:01.664
448	if she was n't lying she would n't be on the roller coaster	N	00:39:03.557
449	no harm no foul	N	00:39:05.251
450	oh but you see she was lying	N	00:39:07.204
451	uh-huh	N	00:39:09.054
452	but you did n't loosen the wheels enough did you	Y	00:39:12.354
453	do n't answer that	N	00:39:14.495
454	so when the roller coaster did n't derail you took things into your own hands	Y	00:39:18.665
455	lisa walked home	N	00:39:32.554
456	jim walked over to his car	N	00:39:34.454
457	what i do n't understand is why you did n't go back and fix the roller coaster	Y	00:39:42.575
458	guess i just did n't think about it	Y	00:39:47.955
459	you 'll be thinking about it now	N	00:39:49.914
460	and for the rest of your life	Y	00:39:52.654
461	all right ladies and gentlemen	N	00:39:56.502
462	welcome to pharaoh 's fever	N	00:39:57.350
463	buckle up	N	00:39:58.197
464	get ready to scream	N	00:39:59.045
465	i should have caught those loose screws	N	00:40:00.874
466	used to check em every morning but since management cut back on my hours	N	00:40:04.415
467	you 're not to blame for this woody	N	00:40:07.534
468	oh i just hope they do n't blame the coaster	N	00:40:09.669
469	it may not be the manhattan express at new york new york or the desperado in primm but it-it it still makes grown men scream	N	00:40:14.390
470	my first week in vegas i road the desperado	N	00:40:19.394
471	my first coaster marathon	N	00:40:21.717
472	i rode that monster for a week straight	N	00:40:23.312
473	hmm	N	00:40:25.530
474	the steel phantom kennywood park pennsylvania i actually hold the marathon record there	N	00:40:28.210
475	uh uh	N	00:40:31.304
476	my-my favorite 's still the um king 's island	N	00:40:32.714
477	the beast	N	00:40:34.124
478	mm	N	00:40:36.364
479	i presented a paper at an entomology convention in cincinnati just so i could ride son of beast	N	00:40:39.254
480	head over heels on a wooden track	N	00:40:41.287
481	ah	N	00:40:42.262
482	so you prefer wood over steel	N	00:40:44.314
483	no	N	00:40:46.377
484	not really	N	00:40:47.371
485	for me it 's not about the track	N	00:40:48.894
486	it 's about the thrill	N	00:40:51.854
