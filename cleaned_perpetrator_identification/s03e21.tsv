220	well the vet flushed and dilated her but her white blood count was through the roof	N	00:24:07.614
221	you have any idea what caused the infection	N	00:24:12.927
222	hard to tell but the uterus is a highly-balanced environment and an infection can start with something as simple as a speck of dirt	N	00:24:18.782
223	the uterine walls sense a foreign body and attack it	N	00:24:23.274
224	i thought the stitches were used to prevent the invasion of foreign bodies	N	00:24:33.514
225	well they 're supposed to but she 's got so much pyometra in her right uterine horn something got in there	N	00:24:38.794
226	unless a horse is opened up you ca n't actually reach the horns	N	00:24:45.594
227	this is outside my purview	N	00:24:58.254
228	uncut diamonds	N	00:25:30.135
229	the horse is a mule	N	00:25:34.175
230	according to his receptionist dr stevens left town	N	00:27:34.894
231	unexpectedly	N	00:27:37.029
232	really	N	00:27:42.075
233	well check this out	N	00:27:43.594
234	i do n't think it 's pixie dust	N	00:27:48.355
235	and lots of red lentils	N	00:27:52.595
236	supposedly used to keep the diamonds from chipping	N	00:27:56.854
237	that dr stevens was very involved	N	00:28:05.190
238	mmm	N	00:28:07.049
239	a horse 's uterus is the size of a football so he could 've packed it with pouches of diamonds	N	00:28:15.214
240	why did he leave one behind	N	00:28:18.714
241	he took what he could reach	N	00:28:20.494
242	and ran	N	00:28:21.889
243	but he was n't on that plane so he could n't have killed the girl	N	00:28:24.014
244	he had a partner	N	00:28:26.594
245	did you know that the term carat comes from the mediterranean carob tree whose seeds were used for centuries as a standard of measurement	N	00:29:07.455
246	no	N	00:29:12.854
247	um so based on the six-to-one lentil-to-diamond ratio in the packet we found and assuming that all the packets are the same size i think we 're looking for five more	N	00:29:21.615
248	five	N	00:29:28.794
249	well yeah based on weight uh we 've established that approximately 183 grams of lentils per pack 732 grams would be	N	00:29:37.814
250	oh my mistake	N	00:29:45.474
251	four	N	00:29:50.334
252	well it 's not 100 accurate but uh based on shape color characteristics wavelength absorptions of the regional impurities it says that these diamonds come from central africa	N	00:29:57.094
253	conflict diamonds	N	00:30:04.034
254	do n't those fund warlords and support child slavery	N	00:30:06.914
255	yeah	N	00:30:09.657
256	bought for pennies on the dollar and banned by the u.n	N	00:30:11.212
257	well that would explain why someone felt the need to smuggle them into the country	N	00:30:14.274
258	that and a half a million dollars worth of luxury tax	N	00:30:17.586
259	no customs no tax	N	00:30:19.642
260	and if lori were about to find out explains why someone would want to kill her	N	00:30:22.994
261	so we 've got the how and the why	N	00:30:26.434
262	we just need the who	N	00:30:28.614
263	well you travel with a well-heeled crowd	N	00:30:37.174
264	i checked everybody 's passports	N	00:30:39.574
265	man you guys get around but you 're the only one who 's been to sierra leone	N	00:30:42.729
266	you know why i became a steward	N	00:30:45.874
267	i do n't know uh see the world	N	00:30:48.254
268	exactly	N	00:30:50.170
269	what 'd you see in sierra leone	N	00:30:51.834
270	well that 's the joke	N	00:30:53.975
271	free night in amsterdam	N	00:30:55.766
272	no no	N	00:30:57.222
273	i went around the globe picking up packages for the fitzgeralds like a frickin bike messenger	N	00:30:59.954
274	oh could you take the plane to rome to ghana pick something up for me	N	00:31:03.994
275	sounds like fun	N	00:31:07.581
276	what kind of stuff did you pick up	N	00:31:08.887
277	who knows	N	00:31:10.341
278	art antiques	N	00:31:11.927
279	it 's usually wrapped up	N	00:31:13.462
280	look i figure i 'm better off not knowing and it looks like i was right	N	00:31:16.434
281	what was your beef with lori the horse trainer	N	00:31:19.775
282	i do n't have one	N	00:31:22.654
283	oh well we got a stack of bloody paper towels with your dna on it that says you do	N	00:31:26.055
284	i took them from her	N	00:31:33.634
285	hey lori dinner 's ready	N	00:31:35.695
286	you okay	N	00:31:37.816
287	yeah the horse is just really freaked out	N	00:31:39.372
288	gave me a good one	N	00:31:41.047
289	would you mind taking these	N	00:31:42.662
290	sure	N	00:31:45.486
291	no problem	N	00:31:46.942
292	i got buzzed into the bedroom	N	00:31:47.744
293	mrs fitzgerald needed help with her zipper	N	00:31:49.194
294	i threw the paper towels in the wastepaper basket	N	00:31:51.894
295	that 's a tidy little story	N	00:32:03.455
296	what have you got	N	00:36:42.074
297	we got animal mineral and now vegetable	N	00:36:44.254
298	what	N	00:36:45.994
299	i ran the trace on the remainder of the diamonds	N	00:36:47.709
300	lentils and carrots	N	00:36:49.934
301	carrots on the karats	N	00:36:51.875
302	i 'm thinking lori packed the diamonds	N	00:36:53.834
303	after she fed the horse evidently	N	00:36:55.735
304	there you go	N	00:36:57.994
305	that a girl	N	00:37:09.845
306	she was the only one who got close to that horse	N	00:37:11.070
307	so dr stevens did n't have one partner he had two	N	00:37:12.434
308	and lori was the only one who knew there was five packages which would explain why stevens left one behind	N	00:37:16.255
309	she was a victim but she was n't innocent	N	00:37:19.684
310	okay so we 've got a dead woman a dead horse a runaway vet and a couple million dollars worth of uncut diamonds that are unaccounted for	N	00:37:27.184
311	well diamonds are worthless unless you have a buyer	N	00:37:33.014
312	what if the vet repackaged the diamonds took them with him	N	00:37:36.295
313	pd traced him to the caymans	N	00:37:39.015
314	but why would he smuggle them into the country only to smuggle them out again	N	00:37:41.255
315	flight steward 's story checks out	N	00:37:44.080
316	lorihutchins had an ante-mortem gash on her right forearm	N	00:37:46.775

322	it was her plane meredith 's horse	N	00:38:00.774
323	she did n't care what happened to the horse	N	00:38:03.094
324	yeah but she 's got no reason to smuggle diamonds	N	00:38:05.126
