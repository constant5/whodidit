299	i went to the pharmacy waited in line picked up the prescription signed for it brought it back to the house	N	00:19:22.716
300	you know tony did nothing for himself except work and get high	N	00:19:26.979
301	got you a brand-new mercedes did n't it	N	00:19:29.737
302	yes it did	N	00:19:30.891

306	well let 's get her on the line	N	00:19:39.767
307	she 's out of town	N	00:19:41.115
308	let me guess she 's incommunicado	N	00:19:43.114
309	that means you ca n't reach her	N	00:19:45.138
310	yeah	N	00:19:46.696
311	oh mind the dummy	N	00:19:50.577
312	it 's been 24 minutes greg	N	00:19:53.919
313	when 's this thing going to be done	N	00:19:55.358
314	well with all due respect sir it 's not a baked potato	N	00:19:58.139
315	it 's braun 's blood and with all the impurities in his system it might take a little extra time	N	00:20:02.156
316	did i ever tell you i used to live in new york	N	00:20:05.354
317	is this going to be a short story or a novel	N	00:20:07.776
318	excuse me	N	00:20:10.575
319	you know heroin has a nine-minute half-life	N	00:20:13.278
320	after that it metabolizes into morphine	N	00:20:15.434
321	what 's the 6-mam count	N	00:20:16.917
322	a hundred fifty-eight	N	00:20:17.554
323	nanograms per mil	N	00:20:18.796
324	definitely not lethal	N	00:20:20.658
325	the same with your xanax	N	00:20:22.226
326	quarter-mil tabs hundred	N	00:20:23.318
327	micrograms per liter	N	00:20:24.410
328	again not lethal	N	00:20:26.088
329	there 's addicts walking around times square with more drugs in their system	N	00:20:28.187
330	so braun should still be walking around	N	00:20:31.434
331	and the point of your new york story was	N	00:20:37.495
332	oh i was just going to tell you about another way to take heroin a suppository up the coolee	N	00:20:40.614
333	you just stand on your head and then you let gravity	N	00:20:44.076
334	forget it	N	00:20:48.236
335	braun did n't die of a drug overdose accidental or otherwise	N	00:20:58.014
336	i figured	N	00:21:00.387
337	so why 'd i bring the dummy	N	00:21:01.485
338	braun 's shirt	N	00:21:05.737
339	robbins opened him up	N	00:21:07.498
340	his lungs were compressed	N	00:21:08.977
341	remember burke and hare the two 19th century scottish body snatchers who made a living intoxicating innocent victims and suffocating them	N	00:21:13.095
342	sold their cadavers to teaching hospitals	N	00:21:17.339
343	got away with it too until a medical student discovered his fiancée on a slab	N	00:21:20.133
344	is this part of the sherlock holmes fan club kit	N	00:21:23.415
345	janinehaywood said that she left the house when the drug dealer arrived	N	00:21:28.954
346	i think she came back	N	00:21:32.333
347	so braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then	N	00:21:34.575
348	would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up fifty pills	N	00:21:40.236
349	and force-feed him a xanax cocktail	N	00:21:46.715
350	so everything was going great until the gardener showed up	N	00:21:49.119
351	then i think her plan turned to panic	N	00:21:51.998
352	it takes time to od time janine did n't have	N	00:21:55.334
353	burke would kneel on his victim 's chest right covering their mouth and nostrils	N	00:22:02.655
354	but when you 're doing drugs you 're a slob and when you 're being manhandled you 're even sloppier	N	00:22:07.777
355	like this	N	00:22:13.659
356	he was burked	N	00:22:22.555
357	hello	N	00:22:28.494
358	where	N	00:22:30.934
359	brass you 're breaking up	N	00:22:33.794
360	said he was in blue diamond digging something up	N	00:22:38.856
361	hey hey what 's going on	N	00:23:06.954
362	anybody ever tell you to call before you dig	N	00:23:09.440
363	i got permission to be here	N	00:23:11.458
364	oh is that right	N	00:23:13.138
365	from who	N	00:23:14.819
366	a dead man	N	00:23:16.139
367	you got a name	N	00:23:17.756
368	my name 's curtritten	N	00:23:19.817
369	look tonybraun was a friend of mine right	N	00:23:21.898
370	this is his property	N	00:23:23.517
371	he calls me about a month ago	N	00:23:25.178
372	he says if anything should happen to me you start digging	N	00:23:27.055
373	you take care of what 's mine at all costs that 's what i 'm doing	N	00:23:30.554
374	do me a favor curtritten	N	00:23:33.107
375	put down the shovel	N	00:23:34.026
376	okay	N	00:23:35.840
377	stand over there	N	00:23:37.817
378	maybe janine had a helper	N	00:23:40.034
379	hey guys you might want to check out the basement	N	00:23:47.638
380	a sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night	N	00:24:40.338
381	that 's a lot of motive	N	00:24:42.215
382	and a lot of silver	N	00:24:50.218
383	okay three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by curtritten	N	00:25:28.494
384	nice	N	00:25:30.956
385	let 's see if that 's where my print came from	N	00:25:32.914
386	no match	N	00:25:35.618
387	oh listen to you	N	00:25:36.454
388	would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth	N	00:25:39.178
389	let me ask you something	N	00:25:43.048
390	braun collected silver coins bullion 23 tons of it	N	00:25:44.265
391	why bury it in blue diamond	N	00:25:48.898
392	cause he was smart	N	00:25:54.318
393	in the past 20 years the value of silver 's gone to nothing	N	00:25:56.234
394	and a commodity broker 's going to charge you a storage fee per troy ounce	N	00:25:58.534
395	and there 's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year	N	00:26:00.934
396	and that 's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee	N	00:26:03.034
397	what good 's collecting silver coupons when you 're dead	N	00:26:08.919
398	depends on who 's doing the clipping	N	00:26:11.196
399	oh we got a positive association	N	00:26:15.675
400	roll to tape	N	00:26:18.237
401	curt to tony	N	00:26:19.033
402	you arresting me for digging	N	00:26:21.936
403	no burglary theft and conspiracy to start	N	00:26:24.195
404	tony asked me to move his silver collection up to his ranch in wyoming	N	00:26:27.958
405	i 'm doing what i was told	N	00:26:31.579
406	mr ritten it appears that we may have physical evidence connecting you to the murder of tonybraun	N	00:26:34.197
407	look i had nothing to do with the drugs	N	00:26:37.137
408	i swear to you i have n't messed around with that stuff in a long time	N	00:26:40.095
409	i was always telling tony as a friend to get off of it to walk away	N	00:26:43.939
410	how 'd you know where the silver was buried	N	00:26:46.805

451	well if their names are curtritten and janinehaywood the answer 's no it 's not their prints	N	00:28:39.837
452	this is ridiculous	N	00:28:42.120
453	this thing must have a virus	N	00:28:43.400
454	maybe you have the wrong suspects	N	00:28:44.997
455	well that 's easy for you to say	N	00:28:46.755
456	all you do is scan prints all day and hit enter	N	00:28:48.635

472	go figure	N	00:29:25.108
473	the more evidence that shows up the more this case does n't make sense	N	00:29:27.247

484	when she was n't at braun 's house playing girlfriend she 's over at vault boy 's flat playing mistress which gives neither of them a credible alibi	N	00:29:55.996

486	what else have we got	N	00:30:02.742

550	yeah i 'm a glorified pit boss	Y	00:32:29.257
551	in the uh last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places	Y	00:32:32.078
552	no	N	00:32:34.328
553	my life 's pretty routine	Y	00:32:35.386
554	it might just get a little more routine	N	00:32:40.337
555	nick i need your leg	N	00:32:47.748
556	show me your bite	N	00:32:48.926
557	oh it 's no worries	N	00:32:49.938
558	i got some cream	N	00:32:50.616
559	hey	N	00:32:51.295
560	all right	N	00:32:52.118
561	it 's no big deal really	N	00:32:52.914
562	what time did you log in at the braun house	N	00:33:05.416
563	9:15 that morning	N	00:33:07.196
564	how long after that did you start processing the backyard	N	00:33:08.995
565	about a half hour	N	00:33:11.127
566	you 're not the only one with chigger bites	N	00:33:12.981
567	who is this	N	00:33:14.955
568	waltbraun	Y	00:33:16.676
569	it 's now 9:30 at night	N	00:33:18.299
570	approximately 36 hours ago you were bitten	N	00:33:20.249
571	three hours earlier than that tonybraun was murdered	N	00:33:22.269
572	chiggers run a predictable course	N	00:33:24.855
573	a chigger attaches itself to a hair follicle injects a digest enzyme into the skin which ruptures the surrounding cells allowing the chigger to suck em up leaving behind a red itchy bump	N	00:33:32.956
574	so	N	00:33:40.238
575	waltbraun lied	Y	00:33:41.598
576	we now have an entomological timeline that places him at the house on the day his brother was murdered	Y	00:33:45.217
577	ah i do n't know boss	N	00:33:48.694
578	i mean ask yourself the question are doggie-door prints and chigger bites enough to get a man for murder	N	00:33:52.556
579	what 've we got	N	00:34:07.098
580	well i got motive	N	00:34:08.858
581	according to the family lawyer the drug addict	N	00:34:10.656
582	now jim that 's just a little callous	N	00:34:12.714
583	i 'm calling it what it is	N	00:34:15.659
584	i know you 're friends with the family but the guy used heroin he was a drug addict who stood in line to inherit the old man 's fortune	N	00:34:19.217
585	what about the brother	Y	00:34:21.534
586	walt 's out of the picture	Y	00:34:22.505
587	he 's left out in the cold	Y	00:34:23.358
588	he is	Y	00:34:24.211
589	yeah	N	00:34:25.697
590	tony promised he 'd take care of him	Y	00:34:27.653
591	whatever he got he split 50-50 all in silver included up until about a month ago	Y	00:34:30.533
592	but tony changed his mind which changed the will	N	00:34:33.879
593	so wait a second janine the stripper claims that half of everything is hers so that 's actually more than just wishful thinking	N	00:34:38.395
594	bet walt was n't too happy about that	Y	00:34:42.609
595	it 's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way	N	00:34:44.867
596	curt was digging up the silver to protect janine 's interest	N	00:34:47.438
597	so what 's right in front of us that we 're missing	N	00:34:49.869
598	what evidence do we have that 's still open	N	00:34:51.849
599	i just got the references off of waltbraun gave the samples to greg	Y	00:34:54.535
