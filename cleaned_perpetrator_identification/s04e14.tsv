293	it 's called a halo	N	00:20:07.154
294	it 's keyed to the sensor in the cash register	N	00:20:09.254
295	now at a preset amount that light goes off letting the store manager know it 's time to transfer the cash to the safe	N	00:20:13.594
296	now check this out	N	00:20:17.614
297	most of the halos are lit	N	00:20:24.134
298	maximum cash just lying in the drawers	N	00:20:26.554
299	so those guys did their homework	Y	00:20:29.124
300	they picked the perfect time to hit	Y	00:20:30.834
301	mm-hmm	N	00:20:32.024

321	and that 's it	N	00:21:34.167
322	thanks doc	N	00:21:35.621
323	catherine something bothering you	N	00:21:44.377
324	a little	N	00:21:46.252
325	look i came here to pick up my wife 's body	N	00:21:48.354
326	i already gave you my statement	N	00:21:50.254
327	well we just need a few more details before we can release the body	N	00:21:52.654
328	i promise this wo n't be long	N	00:21:55.154
329	what	N	00:21:56.554
330	well you said that your wife fell during the gunfight that that 's how you got separated	N	00:21:59.354
331	yeah	N	00:22:02.394
332	do you recall exactly how she fell	N	00:22:04.955
333	well what do you mean	N	00:22:07.394
334	how did she land	N	00:22:08.584
335	did she land sideways backwards	N	00:22:10.634
336	she fell forward i think	N	00:22:14.909
337	she fell forward	N	00:22:17.374
338	so her hands broke the fall landed on her knees	N	00:22:19.804
339	well there were n't any bruises or scrapes on her knees or elbows which is leading me to believe that she did n't fall	N	00:22:26.309
340	well what's-what 's the difference	N	00:22:30.915
341	she 's dead	N	00:22:32.714
342	mr reed there were a lot of bullets flying around that store and a lot of victims and every detail is important but they do n't help if they 're not accurate	N	00:22:37.794
343	well when we started running she was right behind me	N	00:22:45.374
344	she froze up	N	00:22:57.455
345	just stood there looking right at me scared out of her mind	N	00:23:03.914
346	i yelled at her to get down to come over to me	N	00:23:08.874
347	sh-she would n't move	N	00:23:13.734
348	i mean i m	N	00:23:16.854
349	i 'm pretty sure i yelled	N	00:23:19.594
350	highlight the shots that killed the tec-9 shooter	Y	00:23:23.114
351	fromansky said that he fired three or four shots at that target	Y	00:23:29.034
352	he fired four	N	00:23:32.175
353	that accounts for those shots	N	00:23:43.034
354	okay the guy with the shotgun was killed with one bullet	Y	00:23:45.188
355	well those four shots were definitely meant for him	Y	00:23:47.009
356	but this shot is closer to the second gunman than it is to the cocktail waitress	Y	00:23:51.175
357	well fromansky was turning when he fired so his shots were spread out	N	00:23:55.774
358	okay	N	00:24:14.714
359	which means fromansky fired four shots at a target at the back of the store	Y	00:24:19.675
360	just like he said he did	N	00:24:22.407
361	yeah	N	00:24:23.782
362	at the walk-through you said that you saw a third suspect at the back of the store	Y	00:24:30.735
363	why did you make the decision to shoot	N	00:24:34.674
364	i was in fear for my life	N	00:24:36.854
365	did you see a weapon	N	00:24:38.607
366	yes	N	00:24:39.982
367	what kind	N	00:24:41.774
368	a semiautomatic pistol	N	00:24:44.894
369	so you fired first	N	00:24:47.695
370	four times	N	00:24:49.695
371	can you explain the lack of evidence for a third suspect at the scene	Y	00:24:52.914
372	that 's not my job	N	00:24:55.894
373	right or wrong there 'll be guys on the job who 'll think this was personal	N	00:25:01.034
374	they 'd be wrong	N	00:25:04.735
375	did you see juliareed in your line of fire	N	00:25:06.676
376	no	N	00:25:08.911
377	according to supervising criminalist grissom 's report you had an unobstructed view of ms reed so how do you explain the fact that you did n't see her	N	00:25:14.614
378	i ca n't	N	00:25:22.914
379	you do n't deny that a bullet from your weapon killed her	N	00:25:26.594
380	i 'm not denying that	N	00:25:30.574
381	but you ca n't explain it	N	00:25:32.775
382	look your partner was dead	N	00:25:40.555
383	you 'd been shot	N	00:25:42.134
384	you saw someone you thought was a suspect and you fired	Y	00:25:44.374
385	under those circumstances any one of us could make a mistake	N	00:25:48.569
386	did you	N	00:25:52.914
387	officer fromansky answer the question	N	00:25:58.894
388	he says yes he 's a bad cop	N	00:26:06.494
389	he says no he 's a liar	N	00:26:09.294
390	maybe he really does n't know what happened	N	00:26:14.134
391	a little over	N	00:26:22.654
392	perfect	N	00:26:25.449
393	good	N	00:26:27.476
394	let 's say i 'm fromansky	N	00:26:28.191
395	there 's nothing between fromansky and the cocktail waitress	N	00:26:35.854
396	i got a clean view and a clear shot	N	00:26:38.274
397	hey take a look at this	N	00:26:44.694
398	the cracks in the glass from shot 22 are terminated by the cracks from shot 23	N	00:26:50.914
399	so shot 23 had to occur before shot 22	N	00:27:04.114
400	which means that fromansky was firing from left to right not right to left	N	00:27:09.594
401	four shots on a level spread	N	00:27:19.974
402	he was shooting at a moving target	Y	00:27:22.955
403	according to catherine 's witness the cocktail waitress was n't moving	N	00:27:25.814
404	she was a stationary target	N	00:27:28.675
405	so if he was shooting at a moving target where was it moving to	Y	00:27:34.214
406	we have the surveillance tape	N	00:27:59.335
407	shows nothing going on here before during or after the robbery	N	00:28:02.494
408	well just because it shows nothing does n't mean it 's seeing everything	N	00:28:08.874
409	you can see me now right	N	00:28:14.935
410	keep moving to your right	N	00:28:16.695
411	all right	N	00:28:18.394
412	keep going	N	00:28:20.155
413	keep going	N	00:28:20.155
414	i 'm still in	N	00:28:22.845
415	right there	N	00:28:24.336
416	now you 're out	N	00:28:25.892
417	tell me what you see	N	00:28:43.064
418	a getaway	N	00:28:44.874
419	we found metal paint scrapings and skid marks	N	00:28:52.596
420	both recent on that loading dock	N	00:28:54.751
421	these guys definitely had a wheelman	Y	00:28:56.815
422	yeah guy slips in after everything gets started	Y	00:28:58.846
423	during the confusion nobody sees him	Y	00:29:00.942
424	or no one that was alive to tell anyway	N	00:29:03.034
425	except fromansky	N	00:29:04.416
426	yeah	N	00:29:05.092
427	well the suspects knew there was a blind spot	Y	00:29:06.296
428	it has to be an inside job	N	00:29:07.852
429	oh no doubt	N	00:29:10.057
430	matched the cash from the garbage bag to the register receipts 878 was missing	N	00:29:12.731

433	well i 'll run the employees	N	00:29:18.097

450	well	N	00:30:13.474

513	we got a bullet hole in a jacket	N	00:34:06.117
514	that 's not even enough to prove that he was in the store	Y	00:34:07.872
515	what about the cash	N	00:34:09.467
516	it was n't in his apartment	Y	00:34:10.721

518	almost 900 in small bills	N	00:34:13.261
519	we 'd have noticed pockets bulging with a wad like that	N	00:34:15.255
520	what about the calls from the grocery store to the suspect 's cell	Y	00:34:18.194
521	that could have been somebody giving the go signal	N	00:34:21.054
522	there 's no way to tell who	N	00:34:24.137
523	the store runs off of an old pbx system and every call that comes in goes back to the same number	N	00:34:27.691
524	every employee was near a phone so it could have been anybody hey y'all	N	00:34:30.934
525	ran the criminal records for the employees	N	00:34:33.955
526	came up with a raulvaldez	N	00:34:36.446

532	a few years ago he spent some time in prison	N	00:34:48.311
533	lompoc	N	00:34:49.934
534	so brass is trying to find him now	N	00:34:52.989
535	i got to change my pants	N	00:35:37.094
536	you left something in the store besides a urine stain	N	00:36:04.134
537	just a little too tempting huh	N	00:36:09.944
538	all that cash just sitting there right in front of your face	N	00:36:13.154
539	look i go to that store to bag groceries not to get my ass shot off	N	00:36:23.364
540	i figure i earned the money	N	00:36:26.186
541	kind of like working overtime	N	00:36:28.321
542	might as well get something for all your trouble right	N	00:36:30.454
543	considering the fact that your nice little robbery had gone straight to hell	N	00:36:33.034
544	whoa wait a minute	N	00:36:35.414
545	you think	N	00:36:36.915
546	no way	N	00:36:38.234
547	it was an inside job	N	00:36:39.424
548	you knew the registers were full	N	00:36:40.974
549	those gunmen had help from an employee	Y	00:36:43.055
550	not from me they did n't	Y	00:36:45.074
551	look you want to bust me for the money go ahead i took it	N	00:36:47.595
552	but i did not set the thing up	N	00:36:51.495
553	you know hodges already analyzed trace on the bullets	N	00:37:04.695
