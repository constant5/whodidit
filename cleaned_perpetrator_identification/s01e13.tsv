249	dominic this is the type of device that was used to set off the hansen bomb it takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 a.m	N	00:22:10.476
250	we have proof that you purchased the same make of clock but kristy 's time of death was 6:00 a.m	N	00:22:14.826
251	yeah well it suggests a lag between ejaculation and kristy 's murder but it does n't disprove nick 's presence at the time of the homicide	N	00:22:16.402
252	yeah i recognize that you could be a little more supportive	N	00:22:18.257

259	here kristyhopkins was strangled with this sash	N	00:22:32.926
