421	dr coombs we found a 1968 pontiac outside your brother 's house	Y	00:31:53.355
422	the vin matched a car belonging to a victim who was raped and murdered by the same person who raped linleyparker	Y	00:31:59.174
423	and we found linleyparker 's dead body on your brother 's property	Y	00:32:05.735
424	you guys have been wrong before	N	00:32:10.394

428	hey check this out	N	00:33:02.655
429	i just found it in the hose	N	00:33:04.516
430	it 's from a potted plant purchased at the house company	N	00:33:06.031
431	confirms toddcoombs alibi	Y	00:33:07.994
432	you saw this	N	00:33:12.435
433	a pin from the palms linleyparker worked at the palms	N	00:33:15.474
434	a lot of people work at the palms and it does n't nail toddcoombs	Y	00:33:22.030
435	according to the dna the blood from linleyparker 's smashed window matches the semen from all the rapes	N	00:33:27.235
436	which means it does n't match toddcoombs	Y	00:33:31.987
437	or kevincoombs	N	00:33:33.642
438	or any of the rest of the brothers grimm	N	00:33:35.554
439	linley was absolutely certain that toddcoombs raped her	Y	00:33:39.394
440	well maybe the evidence is wrong	N	00:33:43.322
441	you can be wrong i can be wrong the evidence is just the evidence	N	00:33:45.994
442	deep down tell me you do n't think this guy is good for this	Y	00:33:49.514

446	puts him with the body	Y	00:33:58.554
447	it does n't prove rape	N	00:34:00.095
448	i 'll have brass bring him in	Y	00:34:01.874
449	would you strip down to your shorts please doctor	Y	00:34:17.374
450	why	N	00:34:19.305
451	i 'm going to examine your clothing for any trace evidence and we 're going to document your body for any injuries that may have been sustained during a recent struggle	Y	00:34:23.554
452	i do n't have any injuries	Y	00:34:28.274
453	if you 'd like this officer will assist you	Y	00:34:30.595
454	i did not rape that woman	Y	00:34:32.507
455	i did not kill her	Y	00:34:33.922
456	you guys proved that and you let me go	Y	00:34:35.765
457	that 's from moving boxes	N	00:34:37.450
458	thank you	Y	00:34:43.054
459	turn around please	N	00:34:58.229
460	that 's an old scar	N	00:35:05.195
461	i was a bone marrow donor	Y	00:35:07.157
462	my youngest brother joss had leukemia	Y	00:35:09.091
463	hold still please	N	00:35:13.689
464	turn off the lights would you please officer	N	00:35:32.894
465	what are you looking at	N	00:35:52.314
466	this is harassment	N	00:37:03.057
467	i 've already given you guys a dna sample	Y	00:37:04.531
468	you know that bone marrow donation you gave your brother	Y	00:37:09.295
469	i checked your medical records	Y	00:37:14.314
470	his body rejected it and he died	N	00:37:16.634
471	my guess is that 's when you first found out about your unique condition	Y	00:37:22.069
472	the doctors explained it	N	00:37:35.415
473	i 'm a creature of myth	Y	00:37:39.860
474	a chimera	N	00:37:41.854
475	head of a lion body of a goat tail of a dragon	N	00:37:45.765
476	you 're a genetic anomaly	Y	00:37:53.854
477	one person two completely different sets of dna	Y	00:37:58.005
478	state your name for the record	Y	00:38:05.954
479	my name is toddcoombs	Y	00:38:09.815
480	i raped and murdered emmadobbins and linleyparker	Y	00:38:12.554
481	there are more but we 'll talk about those later	Y	00:38:16.964
482	how 'd you pick your victims	Y	00:38:19.854
483	they picked me	Y	00:38:22.115
484	sometimes fraternal twins two separately fertilized eggs develop into only one person	N	00:38:25.475
485	in effect one twin dies in embryo but its dna survives in the other	N	00:38:31.874
486	that 's why the dna from his buccal swab matched his hair but not his semen	Y	00:38:37.924
487	so he had two strains of dna in his body	Y	00:38:42.380
488	yeah and the dna in his semen was evidently from his dead twin brother	Y	00:38:46.085
489	you never met emmadobbins or linleyparker	Y	00:38:49.934
490	i did n't have to meet em	Y	00:38:52.590
491	you go to a bar you see an attractive woman make your move she shoots you down	N	00:38:55.295
492	you go home you masturbate	N	00:38:57.727
493	you get on with it	N	00:38:59.662
494	but when i see a woman who arouses me the whole world disappears except for her	Y	00:39:09.074
