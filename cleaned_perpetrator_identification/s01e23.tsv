211	sarasidle matches the victim prototype to a t she 's a young woman brunette tall for a female	N	00:10:47.895
212	you 're not serious	N	00:10:54.779
213	and by all reports she 's steady	N	00:10:56.418
214	has the right personality for a decoy operation	N	00:10:57.976
215	you 're going to bait this guy with a human being	Y	00:11:00.216
216	this is your big fbi plan	N	00:11:02.776
217	before he kills again yes	Y	00:11:05.018
218	got a better idea	N	00:11:07.217
219	understanding him first completely so that we can get out ahead of him	Y	00:11:10.555
220	and if he kills again while we 're trying to understand him	Y	00:11:13.835
221	well i 'm sorry but he 's not going to kill my csi	Y	00:11:16.096
222	i 'm going to do it grissom	N	00:11:18.156
223	i want to	N	00:11:19.807
224	you want to put yourself in the path of a psychotic killer	N	00:11:21.343
225	i 'm trained in weaponless defense	N	00:11:23.195
226	too bad because that 's what turns him on women fighting back	Y	00:11:25.638
227	gives him a greater sense of power when he makes his final kill	Y	00:11:28.638
228	grissom	N	00:11:30.728
229	sit down sara	N	00:11:31.626

232	not yet	N	00:11:44.309
233	he knows just enough about forensics to be dangerous	Y	00:11:46.289
234	he thinks he 's throwing us off track by planting confederate hairs	Y	00:11:49.878
235	he probably shaves his head maybe his entire body as dna protection	Y	00:11:53.134
236	he may gag his victims using a garden-variety bath towel which he then takes with him as part of his murder kit	Y	00:11:57.857
237	he will go after another tall brunette and the torture will be worse	Y	00:12:02.996
238	but this time he wo n't ejaculate	Y	00:12:06.439
239	at least not at the scene	N	00:12:08.405
240	at home later	N	00:12:09.535
241	he 's learning control	Y	00:12:10.665
242	think he knows his next victim	Y	00:12:12.395
243	signature killers always know their next victim	N	00:12:14.418
244	but they do n't know him	N	00:12:16.136
245	until he tortures rapes and kills them	N	00:12:18.519

448	he read the papers he piggybacked on top of the killer	Y	00:24:34.104

463	as we 've been reporting a suspect has been arrested in the strip-strangler case	N	00:25:17.154
464	we believe that bradleymac walden not only killed his wife but also took the lives of audreyhayes and eileen snow and tracyberg	N	00:25:23.838
465	our field agents have divulged that mr walden lived within two miles of the other victims worked in the same office building as ms snow and has no believable explanation for his whereabouts on the dates of their murders	N	00:25:33.276
466	we believe that bradleymac walden found and stalked these victims and	N	00:25:41.057
467	i just talked with brass	N	00:25:46.918
468	he said that walden was having an affair with a dentist in his office	N	00:25:48.994
469	i 'm telling you this guy did not kill those other women	N	00:25:53.197

474	i 'll take some questions	N	00:26:07.250
475	mr grissomlynda darbylas vegas tribune	N	00:26:10.354
476	as the lead csi on this case do you have anything to add to the fbi statement	N	00:26:12.139
477	politics	N	00:26:13.459
478	no	N	00:26:19.436
479	so lasvegas can breathe easier	N	00:26:21.238
480	you do have the strip strangler behind bars	Y	00:26:23.394
481	no we do n't	N	00:26:28.194
482	that 's all the information we have	N	00:26:31.133
483	the fbi did me a favor being here and they have a viable suspect	N	00:26:39.835
484	he 's not viable brian	N	00:26:42.807
485	then further investigation will prove that out	N	00:26:44.581
486	in the meantime people will feel better about their daily lives	N	00:26:47.436
487	now why on earth would you want to counteract that	N	00:26:50.475
488	for those who have to ask no answer could suffice	N	00:26:52.874
489	look i see we 've come to an impasse	N	00:26:54.677
