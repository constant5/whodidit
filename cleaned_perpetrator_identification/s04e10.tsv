172	all i remember is getting new clothes and going home	Y	00:16:19.095

174	she 's covering for her brother	Y	00:16:31.434
175	he 's got a non-confirmable alibi	N	00:16:33.814
176	i 'm sure she does n't want to lose the only guardian she 's got	Y	00:16:42.155
177	it 's pretty obvious the initial blows were to the head	N	00:16:49.297
178	well according to sara that 's consistent with the girl 's story	Y	00:16:50.955
179	whoever attacked him just kept going	N	00:16:53.829
180	used some real force	N	00:16:55.854
181	severed his spinal cord at c-l c-2	N	00:16:58.994
182	well that would have rendered him immobile	N	00:17:01.186
183	right so why keep hitting	N	00:17:02.761
184	the epidermis was disturbed leaving areas of exposed derma which we 'd normally see as red or purple abrasions	N	00:17:07.594
185	but in this case no blood rushed to the area	N	00:17:13.035
186	he was beaten postmortem	N	00:17:16.324
187	right	N	00:17:18.075
188	so gregorycurtwell sees brian attacking his sister	Y	00:17:20.704
189	his adrenaline starts going and he ca n't stop	N	00:17:24.675
190	well brian may have gotten off a punch of his own	N	00:17:28.674
191	i ca n't identify the pattern but i sent blood and skin transfer to greg	N	00:17:33.254
192	and you 're going to need these	N	00:17:38.494
193	thanks	N	00:17:40.274
194	that 's our son	N	00:17:48.884
195	who could have done this to my baby	N	00:17:52.195
196	do you recognize this girl	Y	00:17:56.494
197	did brian ever mention the name ashleycurtwell	Y	00:18:02.704
198	he got a little out of hand for a while	N	00:18:06.614
199	we could n't keep track of his friends	N	00:18:09.259
200	out of hand	N	00:18:11.454
201	i found some marijuana in his room	N	00:18:13.555
202	broke curfew	N	00:18:16.555
203	the nipple piercing was the last straw	N	00:18:18.614
204	i told him he could do anything he wanted to the body god gave him once he moved out	N	00:18:22.554
205	until then	N	00:18:25.937
206	he was grounded	N	00:18:27.011
207	but he was doing so much better	N	00:18:28.775
208	his grades were up	N	00:18:31.715
209	he got a job	N	00:18:34.234
210	where did he work	N	00:18:35.876
211	my brother owns a restaurant	N	00:18:37.552
212	got him a job bussing and waiting tables	N	00:18:39.654
213	five hundred bucks every two weeks	N	00:18:44.294
214	cash under the table	N	00:18:46.657
215	pretty good for a kid who ca n't drive	N	00:18:47.935
216	no gsr on either the husband 's or ex-husband 's hands	N	00:18:54.607
217	that 's not definitive	N	00:18:56.061
218	one of them still could have fired the gun and washed his hands	N	00:18:58.935
219	yeah	N	00:19:01.554
220	well you know you asked me to check marlenemitchell 's bullet for trace	N	00:19:03.744
221	hmm	N	00:19:06.025
222	well there is n't any	N	00:19:07.115
223	it 's in pristine condition	N	00:19:08.205
224	the only reason for shallow penetration is loss of momentum	N	00:19:10.639
225	yeah and it was a standard full metal jacket not a pre-fragmented so assuming that the bullet did n't come in contact with any intervening object what slowed it down	N	00:19:18.049
226	hey sanders you got anything on that knuckle sludge	N	00:19:26.586
227	grissom 's asking	N	00:19:28.162
228	yeah a skin sample taken from brianhaddick 's defensive wounds hair samples from ashleycurtwell and buccal swab collected from gregorycurtwell	Y	00:19:32.694
229	no match to the brother or sister	Y	00:19:37.374
230	construction worker did n't do it	N	00:19:39.374
231	or he did n't do it alone	N	00:19:41.315
232	seventy-two-degree impact angle puts brian here for the initial blows	N	00:19:49.619
233	width is three millimeters	N	00:19:57.874
234	length is six	N	00:20:00.144
235	arcsine gives us 30 degrees	N	00:20:05.095
236	so brian was crawling	N	00:20:08.355
237	that must be when his neck was exposed	N	00:20:12.229
238	he ended up here on the floor with his spinal cord severed	N	00:20:18.355
239	well if he was laying down this looks too high to be a spatter	N	00:20:23.534
240	must be cast-off	N	00:20:26.884
241	on three walls	N	00:20:28.734
242	assailants tend to move only in reaction to a target brian was stationary	Y	00:20:32.484
243	why would the attacker keep moving	Y	00:20:35.307
244	it does n't make sense	N	00:20:38.001
245	it does if there were three hammers and three attackers	Y	00:20:41.455
246	here i 'm looking for three guys but you only found one hammer with blood on it so who do you want me to follow	Y	00:26:00.774
247	me	N	00:26:03.754
248	what 's up	N	00:26:06.907
249	the shoe tread i found at the scene it 's a world industries diablo	N	00:26:08.242
