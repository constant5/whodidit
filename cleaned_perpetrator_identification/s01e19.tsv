553	it 's a flame-retardant material generic name 's metaramid	N	00:31:48.857
554	from the baby 's clothes	N	00:31:50.756
555	fire-retardant infant 's clothes are made out of vinyon	N	00:31:53.055
556	the fiber found in zack 's throat is a stronger chemical treatment	N	00:31:56.176
557	it 's found in things that are made to be near fire and flames	N	00:32:01.314
558	hey can i go with you	N	00:32:11.785
559	same color as the fiber in zack 's throat	N	00:32:38.779
560	okay this is the 911 call from the anderson house at 4:30 a.m	N	00:32:45.134
561	our baby has been kidnapped	N	00:32:48.936
562	493 fairmark	N	00:32:50.848
563	please hurry	N	00:32:52.224
564	mrs anderson was n't there	N	00:32:54.519
565	you would n't think so but i went ahead and separated out any underlying voices	N	00:32:57.557
566	what are we going to do	N	00:33:00.744
567	she was standing like two meters from the phone	N	00:33:03.246
568	yeah well it 's a legitimate comment	N	00:33:04.747
569	does n't make her guilty of anything	N	00:33:06.323
570	i know so i checked to see if she was like faking her concern	N	00:33:07.774
571	this program measures the stress level of the speakers	N	00:33:09.594
572	oh god what are we going to do	N	00:33:12.955
573	the stress is real	N	00:33:19.515
574	are you familiar with the jonbenet case	N	00:33:21.874
575	a little	N	00:33:24.076
576	well the police went back and they found an earlier call that was placed from the home to 911 and the audio tests separated out the son 's voice	N	00:33:28.856
577	now i 'm not saying that tyler 's our guy but we need to check into every avenue	N	00:33:36.997
578	well i did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the anderson house from the land line or from the cell phone	N	00:33:42.678
579	in the parents name but did you look under tyler s	N	00:33:46.718
580	i mean a rich kid like that 's probably got a cell phone	N	00:33:49.576
581	yeah	N	00:33:51.978
582	all right i 'll get into it	N	00:33:53.755
583	hello	N	00:33:56.592
584	anderson 's attorney	N	00:33:57.297
585	seven a.m	N	00:33:58.002
586	7:00 a.m	N	00:33:58.889
587	i 'll be there	N	00:33:59.787
588	bring all the evidence	N	00:34:00.772
589	yeah	N	00:34:01.678
590	i 'll bring it all	N	00:34:02.584
591	thanks	N	00:34:04.097
592	my colleagues messrs landry and frank are representing steve and tyleranderson respectively	N	00:34:20.858
593	although we 're not co-counsel in the strictest sense we 've agreed the authorities should have no more than three questions to put to our clients each	N	00:34:27.236
594	after that we 'll accept written submissions only	N	00:34:32.217
595	nice what money can buy	N	00:34:34.696
596	my family is done being railroaded by you people so just ask your questions and let 's go	Y	00:34:38.178
597	i do n't have any questions	N	00:34:41.378
598	we know what happened in your house the night zachary died	N	00:34:44.316
599	we 've interpreted the evidence	N	00:34:47.139
600	all right let 's work backwards starting with the cover-up	N	00:34:49.638
601	sometime around 11:00 p.m the night of the kidnapping you and mr anderson had a drink rum and cola	N	00:34:54.816
602	and decided what to do with the body of zachary	N	00:35:02.776
603	we have yet to determine whether or not his death was accidental or intentional	N	00:35:09.618
604	the question documents lab thinks that a parent wrote the ransom note because there 's no money amount	N	00:35:15.355
605	too hard to put a price on your own son	N	00:35:22.216
606	mrs anderson while your husband was writing the ransom note you wrapped zachary 's body in a blanket that you got from the upstairs linen closet	N	00:35:28.296
607	you then laid his body to rest near a statue on the golf course	N	00:35:38.797
608	that 's how you got the grass stains on your nylons	N	00:35:53.478
609	you put down a plastic bag from the pantry so that he 'd remain dry	N	00:35:59.535
610	evidence of genuine care and concern	N	00:36:04.116
611	and mr anderson you put up a ladder outside the window	N	00:36:07.399
612	the only shoe prints we found were yours and the gardener 's and the gardener has been out of town	N	00:36:11.876
613	you then drove over to your office and cranked off a ransom note on the first available printer	N	00:36:18.516
614	possibly thinking that if you used a printer from outside your house we would n't be able to trace it	N	00:36:24.416
615	but these three dots have given you away	N	00:36:27.517
616	this may prove cover-up	N	00:36:33.697
617	none of it proves they killed zachary	N	00:36:37.177
618	you 're right counselor	N	00:36:38.716
619	zachary 's life was taken much earlier in the evening	N	00:36:40.798
620	the coroner estimated time of death at 9:00 p.m	N	00:36:43.958
621	estimated	N	00:36:46.435
622	it could be 8:30	N	00:36:48.435
623	yes	N	00:36:50.577
624	while robbie and zachary were in tyler 's care	Y	00:36:53.618
625	you said that we could ask three questions each	N	00:36:59.159
626	am i right	N	00:37:00.837
627	stop	N	00:37:02.374
628	ty did n't do this	N	00:37:03.556
629	do n't give them anything	N	00:37:04.498
630	no no	N	00:37:05.257
631	it does n't matter	N	00:37:06.016
632	we 're already ruined	Y	00:37:06.776
633	look they 're just they 're just trying to protect me all right	N	00:37:09.197
634	please	N	00:37:11.847
635	and i ca n't go on	N	00:37:13.064
636	mrs anderson	N	00:37:14.249
637	i killed him	N	00:37:15.227
638	i came home	N	00:37:17.438
639	tyler h-h-had n't put zachary to bed because he he was crying and i wanted to hush him up and and i just	N	00:37:21.777
640	i went too far	N	00:37:25.714
641	for the record my client made this statement against legal counsel	N	00:37:28.958
642	would you tell us how you killed him	N	00:37:34.036
643	i smothered him with a pot holder	N	00:37:38.735
644	and that 's when steve and i came up with the kidnap story	N	00:37:41.736
645	it was the longest night of our lives	N	00:37:45.757
646	you had to wait till morning to report him missing	N	00:37:51.998
647	so that it would n't look suspicious	N	00:37:54.418
648	and you may not believe me but i loved him	N	00:37:58.776
649	i loved him very very much	N	00:38:00.972
650	we 're going to have to have them both arrested	N	00:38:07.814
651	i was just coming to meet you guys	N	00:38:23.048
652	i thought you were at the andersons	Y	00:38:23.708
653	we 're done	N	00:38:24.368
654	she copped	N	00:38:25.028
655	what	N	00:38:27.566
656	guilty people do that when you corner them with evidence	N	00:38:29.340
657	guys the mother did n't do it	N	00:38:31.275
658	listen	N	00:38:35.154
659	what did you do robbie	Y	00:38:41.577
660	what did you do	Y	00:38:43.267
661	i was watching the boys	Y	00:38:47.818
662	i had my eye on them i did	Y	00:38:51.057
663	yeah	N	00:38:58.034
664	but then you called your girlfriend	N	00:39:00.338
665	and we got to talking	N	00:39:02.315
666	and i was kind of ignoring zack and robbie	Y	00:39:06.736
667	they were being quiet	Y	00:39:10.875
668	they were behaving	Y	00:39:13.313
669	i turned around and i saw how still he was	N	00:39:16.357
670	i ran to him and he was dead	N	00:39:22.314
671	and that 's when you called 911	N	00:39:27.034
672	but you must have dropped the phone to tend to zack	N	00:39:35.537
673	911	N	00:39:37.457
674	what did you do robbie	Y	00:39:42.819
675	what did you do	Y	00:39:46.716
676	and i guess somewhere in the chaos you got disconnected	N	00:39:48.657
677	soon after that your parents arrived	N	00:39:55.678
678	oh my god	N	00:39:59.494
679	what happened	N	00:40:04.694
680	one of you worked on him so hard that you cracked his sternum	N	00:40:08.240
681	he was already blue	N	00:40:09.477
682	i pushed	N	00:40:14.017
683	i tried to breathe air into him but he was gone	N	00:40:18.118
684	we did everything that we could	N	00:40:20.696
685	why did n't you just tell the truth	N	00:40:23.216
686	we wanted to protect robbie	Y	00:40:25.697
687	we did n't want him to grow up with the stigma of the boy who killed his brother	Y	00:40:34.753
688	he 's three	Y	00:40:40.477
689	he 's clinically unaware of his actions	Y	00:40:42.276
690	no court would hold him accountable for that	Y	00:40:44.750
691	but everybody else would know	N	00:40:47.336
692	it would follow him the rest of his life	Y	00:40:49.794
693	and my wife would rather go to prison than to have anybody know what robbie did	Y	00:40:55.875
694	mr anderson we wo n't let that happen	N	00:41:03.833
695	now i know why you did n't want to hold robbie when your husband handed him to you outside the police department	Y	00:41:32.196
696	i 'm very sorry	N	00:41:39.617
697	i always uh	N	00:41:44.017
698	i always tell them gentle gentle	Y	00:41:46.876
699	he did n't mean it	Y	00:41:50.849
700	i know he did n't mean it	Y	00:41:51.907
701	of course he did n't	Y	00:41:53.537
702	you must think that we are awful people all this stuff that 's come out	N	00:42:08.174
703	you 're an average family burdened with a tragedy that put you under a microscope	N	00:42:12.598
704	that close nobody can look good	N	00:42:17.577
705	your family 's waiting for you	Y	00:42:29.055
706	you ready	N	00:42:31.497
707	will the family be moving	Y	00:42:45.855
708	will you make any statements	N	00:42:48.091
