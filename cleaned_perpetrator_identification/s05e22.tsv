614	and i know what you 're thinking that i killed alicegranger	N	00:35:04.781
615	you 're a mind reader	Y	00:35:14.559
616	i already admitted that i picked her up at a bar the other night	N	00:35:17.204
617	what i did n't mention and you did n't ask was that i gave her a ride home	N	00:35:21.886
618	it got hot and heavy	N	00:35:25.585
619	we both got what we needed	N	00:35:28.681

621	i drove off	N	00:35:34.243
622	uh do you have any evidence at all that refutes my client 's account or suggests otherwise	N	00:35:37.243
623	our evidence pertains to the second victim killed last night with the same gun and we believe that a portion of your client 's tongue was in her stomach	N	00:35:43.066
624	i can explain that	N	00:35:47.172
625	oh	N	00:35:47.904
626	really	N	00:35:48.636

633	her taxi finally showed up	N	00:36:03.712
634	i spoke to both the bartender at the highball and the cab company and a cab was ordered and drove the victim home	N	00:36:08.044
635	mr novak have you ever been to hollypearson 's house	N	00:36:12.554
636	no	N	00:36:14.209
637	i have no idea where she lived	N	00:36:16.925
638	then how do you explain your courthouse keycard which we found near her body	N	00:36:20.382
639	csi matched the prints on the card	N	00:36:22.926
640	only yours	N	00:36:24.524
641	every attorney in the public defender 's office is issued one card	N	00:36:27.443
642	mine has never left my car	N	00:36:30.406
643	i keep it in the center console	N	00:36:32.084
644	you do n't need a warrant	N	00:36:33.599
645	you have my permission to check	N	00:36:34.623
646	it should be there	N	00:36:35.647
647	well that wo n't be hard to verify because your car 's already at csi	N	00:36:37.942
648	nick	N	00:36:46.156
649	hey	N	00:36:47.094
650	the center console	N	00:36:48.486
651	was there a parking lot car key inside	N	00:36:50.004
652	no	N	00:36:51.675
653	two sticks of gum and a pack of condoms why	N	00:36:53.171
654	suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene was n't his	N	00:36:57.022
655	it looks like he was lying	N	00:37:01.626
656	we got him	N	00:37:02.946
657	i do n't know how you 're going to take this but i think this car was recently broken into	N	00:37:06.861
658	these scratches they look fresh	N	00:37:12.083
659	b and e 101	N	00:37:17.361
660	the slim jim	N	00:37:20.098
661	somebody could 've swiped his keycard	N	00:37:25.876
662	and then locked the car back up	N	00:37:28.174
663	novak would n't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again did you find any prints	N	00:37:31.205
664	smudges and partials inside and out	N	00:37:35.965
665	run em	N	00:37:39.746
666	let 's run through the night alice died again	N	00:38:04.167
667	we 've been through this	Y	00:38:05.447
668	i have an alibi	Y	00:38:06.546
669	your alibi only proves you lost track of her	Y	00:38:07.145
670	you knew where alice lived	Y	00:38:07.744
671	have you been in adamnovak 's car recently	Y	00:38:13.066
672	no	N	00:38:14.784
673	i do n't even know an adamnovak	Y	00:38:16.502
674	but you identified his vehicle as the car that alice left the bar in	Y	00:38:18.863
675	i did n't know whose car it was	Y	00:38:21.686
676	then why did we find your prints in it	N	00:38:24.326
677	maybe somebody 's trying to frame me	Y	00:38:26.865
678	no but i think that you 're familiar with the concept	Y	00:38:29.941
679	you were obsessed with alice and when you saw adam having at her you flipped out	Y	00:38:35.642
680	i mean here 's a woman that you ca n't get any traction with yet she 's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar	Y	00:38:47.804
681	jeff	Y	00:39:06.025
682	i mean lucky for you the highball was adam 's second home	Y	00:39:15.746
683	the next night you came back and saw his car in the parking lot	Y	00:39:20.705
684	creative justice	N	00:39:25.646
685	you could get them both	N	00:39:29.465
686	it was just bad luck that hollypearson met adam that night	N	00:39:34.738
687	you had no reason to kill her but you followed her home and worked up the nerve	Y	00:39:37.844
688	you made one mistake though	Y	00:40:02.286
689	the evidence that you used to frame him brought us back to you	Y	00:40:06.065
690	you figured out the source of the contamination	N	00:40:17.222
691	i got a positive result off my negative control	N	00:40:20.125
692	matched the contamination	N	00:40:22.121
693	turns out somebody at the manufacturer forgot to put on their mask and then sneezed or coughed on what was supposed to be a sterile product	N	00:40:26.965
694	you have to collect everyone 's swabs	N	00:40:31.286
695	kits	N	00:40:32.244
696	trucks	N	00:40:33.202
697	vests	N	00:40:34.160
698	work stations	N	00:40:35.118
699	how long till the new shipment gets here	N	00:40:36.559
700	it 's on its way	N	00:40:38.144
701	until then do it old school	N	00:40:39.729
702	gil	N	00:40:45.586
703	i 'd ask you out for a drink but under the circumstances it 's uh	N	00:40:51.944
704	okay how long is this going to go on	N	00:40:57.925
705	i do n't know catherine	N	00:40:59.842
706	gil it was an act of omission	N	00:41:03.585
707	how many times have we heard a public defender say that	N	00:41:06.946
708	i went out after work	N	00:41:10.504
709	is it a crime to want a little human contact	N	00:41:13.018
710	i guess that 's why i do n't go out	N	00:41:15.846
