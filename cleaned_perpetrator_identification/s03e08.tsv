118	there is another guy there he traces the shape of the piece on the paper	Y	00:14:51.591
119	he 's almost one and three-quarter inches taller than the security guard from the tip down the slope looks to be slightly curved	Y	00:14:54.234

130	what about the rest of the room he draws the same pattern only around the circle	N	00:15:20.994
131	the film picks up everything there is to see catherine repeating pattern	N	00:15:22.716
132	we 've seen everything circular saw maybe	N	00:15:24.552
133	maybe there 's a short end grissom picks up the piece and holds it up close to his face	N	00:15:26.734
134	what this does n't seem sharp enough for a saw	N	00:15:28.529
