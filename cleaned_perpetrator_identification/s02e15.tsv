154	fabric would have fueled it	N	00:08:53.851
155	i do n't know	N	00:08:55.071
156	it does n't make any sense	N	00:08:56.095
157	a fire burning downward	N	00:08:57.119
158	yeah unless it was chasing after an accelerant	N	00:09:00.599

223	we have evidence that mike may have had an inappropriate relationship with your daughter	N	00:13:43.935
224	what kind of evidence	N	00:13:46.635
225	photographic and definitive	N	00:13:48.715
226	that the man i was going to marry somehow sexually no i do n't believe that	N	00:13:53.217
227	things like this happen sometimes right under our noses	N	00:13:58.238
228	we 're going to have to talk with your daughter	N	00:14:01.837
229	jody we found pictures in mike 's house of you posing	N	00:14:06.074

233	i wish you would just listen once	N	00:14:20.017
234	in some of the pictures you 're wearing a bathing suit	N	00:14:24.777
235	do you remember mike taking them	N	00:14:31.994
236	jody anything that he did to you was not your fault	N	00:14:44.298
237	you can tell me if mike took those pictures	N	00:14:48.576
238	jody	N	00:14:56.516
239	honey	N	00:14:58.018
240	i loved mike and he loved me	N	00:15:00.915
241	the daughter clammed up	N	00:15:15.396
242	seems to be in the protect-the-abuser trap	N	00:15:17.274
243	i 'm going to take her over to the hospital for a sart exam	N	00:15:19.594
244	what are the chances mom knew what her boyfriend was up to	N	00:15:21.587
245	i 've seen it happen	N	00:15:22.923
246	as a mother i hope not	N	00:15:24.714
247	yeah right	N	00:15:26.357
248	i 'm going to look into it	N	00:15:27.392
249	well our photo guys tell me those pictures were taken with mikekimble 's type of camera	N	00:15:40.034
250	yeah	N	00:15:42.849
251	yeah	N	00:15:43.827
252	what are you doing here	N	00:15:45.377
253	a thousand points of light and i only need one to clear up this picture	N	00:15:47.418
254	the blur equals the length of the light	N	00:15:56.936
255	if i can compress this light back into a point then the rest of the picture gets clear	N	00:16:00.715
256	that 's how they got hinkley 's image when he was shooting the prez	N	00:16:08.214
257	what is that	N	00:16:10.794
258	there at the bottom right corner	N	00:16:12.618
259	is that a finger	N	00:16:14.256
260	yeah i think so	N	00:16:15.938
261	well that 's unusual is n't it	N	00:16:17.515
262	a professional photographer gets a finger in the shot	N	00:16:19.679
263	maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged	N	00:16:22.400
264	i 'm going to work on that for a while and see if i can get some ridge detail	N	00:16:24.595
265	maybe even a fat print	N	00:16:27.276
266	i ll	N	00:16:29.779
267	i 'll see you later	N	00:16:31.099
268	so this is your experiment huh	N	00:16:36.538
269	so because you found beef in the wound tracts of the victim you think the meat might be from one of the body farm cows	N	00:16:42.979
270	did the fly find the beef in the wound and lay its eggs or did it bring the beef with him	N	00:16:49.054
271	i did an experiment similar to this in san francisco except the cross-contamination was blood	N	00:16:54.654
272	was n't a murder case but it was instructional	N	00:16:58.474
273	none of these beef particles are as big as the tissue found in mikekimble 's wound tract	N	00:17:04.953
274	and i found out the ex-husband is the proud owner of a registered handgun	Y	00:17:12.297
275	hmm what does that mean	N	00:17:15.777
276	it means i need to see that gun	N	00:17:17.817
277	uh grissom are n't you going to tell me anything	N	00:17:19.858
278	about	N	00:17:24.218
279	the case the meat what you found	N	00:17:25.936
280	i 'm working it	N	00:17:28.819
281	i thought i was working it with you	N	00:17:30.457
282	yes	N	00:17:32.035
283	you 're right you are	N	00:17:33.538

430	everyone does it jake	N	00:26:47.898
431	you just feel like you 're the only one	N	00:26:49.995

439	rough	N	00:27:29.295
440	well listen in the future dude even if the situation 's embarrassing the truth 's probably the best policy there	N	00:27:34.258
441	yeah	N	00:27:38.676
442	hey listen you ever notice your mom 's boyfriend acting weird around your sister	N	00:27:41.857

456	is n't this your day off	N	00:28:39.918
457	on the day you plan to expend a meat bullet	N	00:28:42.758
458	ahh a frozen meat bullet	N	00:28:47.176
459	yeah i had to freeze it with a touch of liquid nitrogen	N	00:28:50.295
460	well i 'm ready to watch history	N	00:28:53.177
461	bullet-like entry wound	N	00:29:13.373
462	the meat disintegrates	N	00:29:17.896
463	lost in the soft tissue	N	00:29:20.257
464	hmm	N	00:29:23.777
465	you 're quite a marksman russ and inventive	Y	00:29:25.646
466	you managed to build a bullet made of meat	Y	00:29:27.262
467	the meat from the projectile was visually indistinguishable from the victim 's stomach tissue	N	00:29:33.317
468	we know that your gun was clean but it turns out that your re-loader was n't	Y	00:29:38.439
469	yeah	N	00:29:41.635
470	we got this from your garage on a warrant	Y	00:29:43.656
471	we figured a gun enthusiast like yourself would have one of these	Y	00:29:46.335
472	packs gunpowder into used shell casings	N	00:29:48.719
473	cheaper than buying new rounds right	N	00:29:50.317
474	the material that was on your re-loader is consistent with the material we found in the victim 's wound tract	Y	00:29:56.215
475	ground beef	N	00:29:59.858
476	a father knows	Y	00:30:04.736
477	i mean he was giving her gifts you know cameras	Y	00:30:09.653
478	he gave her a camera	N	00:30:17.259
479	and the wedding was like a week off and he was going to be living under the same roof as my children full-time	Y	00:30:24.717
480	when i went over there you know i was just going to set him straight right	Y	00:30:30.479
481	now i ca n't help it if she likes me	N	00:30:35.898
482	i guess it 's like mother like daughter	N	00:30:38.416
483	you touch my little girl and i will kill you	Y	00:30:41.137
484	too late	N	00:30:44.254
485	that 's when i lost it	Y	00:30:46.774
486	then you dumped him at the body farm	Y	00:30:48.759
487	your grocery chain makes regular meat deliveries there for experimental purposes	Y	00:30:53.055

492	i	Y	00:31:09.344
493	i feel relieved	Y	00:31:11.017
494	i 'd like to make a formal confession	Y	00:31:14.218
495	he can confess to the homicide but we 're still examining evidence on the arson	Y	00:31:18.254
496	the guy wants to take the heat for his daughter on the arson well where 's the harm in that	Y	00:31:21.775
497	the harm would be to the justice system unless i misunderstand our place in it	N	00:31:25.895
498	do n't you think that little girl 's been through enough	N	00:31:29.737
499	what i think and what the evidence proves are possibly two different things	N	00:31:33.314
500	what is this	N	00:31:40.476
501	it 's uh just what it says it 's a request for a leave of absence six months year maybe	N	00:31:45.019
502	why	N	00:31:49.373
