362	no kidding	N	00:23:17.904
363	yeah my vehicle was broken into and my field kit was stolen	N	00:23:20.054

366	would you keep an eye on this for me	N	00:23:28.976
367	sure	N	00:23:30.772
368	thanks	N	00:23:32.454
369	excuse me	N	00:23:33.935
370	kip	N	00:23:52.824
371	sheriff	N	00:23:53.434
372	listen why do n't you come on by and fill out a report about that kit	N	00:24:01.129
373	you think that would help	N	00:24:04.114
374	it would n't hurt	N	00:24:06.154
375	i uh found the victim 's car	N	00:24:08.854
376	well i am impressed	N	00:24:10.647
377	wh where was it	N	00:24:12.101
378	it was uh ditched in an old barn up in the hills	N	00:24:14.295
379	uh-huh	N	00:24:16.214
380	i know you do n't have any men to spare so i called the highway patrol	N	00:24:18.194
381	they 're sending troopers up there to secure the site	N	00:24:20.715
382	oh well nearest station 's in elko	N	00:24:23.079
383	should take em a couple hours to get here	N	00:24:25.639
384	well that should uh give you enough time to burn down the barn	N	00:24:28.434
385	you going to just stand there or are you coming in	N	00:26:03.294
386	oh i do n't want to disturb the scene	N	00:26:05.286
387	you carry on	N	00:26:06.661
388	shame to see so much work go to waste	N	00:26:10.254
389	what does that mean exactly	N	00:26:17.415
390	well unless you 've managed to improvise yourself a warrant as well this is an illegal search	N	00:26:21.039
391	this barn had been broken into which makes it a crime scene even without the murder victim 's car inside so i do n't need a warrant	N	00:26:29.074
392	who owns this place	N	00:26:34.514
393	nobody	N	00:26:35.926
394	owner died a few years ago	N	00:26:37.541
395	well then who 's responsible for the property	N	00:26:40.554
396	his nephew	N	00:26:42.935
397	marty cooperman	N	00:26:44.975

403	we found his car up in the hills	N	00:27:25.134
404	in your uncle 's old barn	N	00:27:27.274
405	oh i have n't been up there for years	N	00:27:30.915
406	that 's understandable	N	00:27:32.614
407	it 's hard to get to	N	00:27:33.764
408	not too many gas stations around here	N	00:27:36.326
409	you must do pretty good business	N	00:27:38.341

414	i can have your window fixed in a couple hours mr grissom and then you can get back home	N	00:27:55.695
415	i think you should do that	N	00:28:00.455
416	grissom	N	00:28:10.234
417	everybody in sleepy hollow still drawing a blank on the victim	N	00:28:12.474
418	more or less	N	00:28:14.637
419	well then somebody 's lying	N	00:28:15.591
420	rossjenson was having a relationship with someone in jackpot	N	00:28:17.714
421	greg traced a series of romantic i.m.s from your victim 's computer	N	00:28:21.094
422	greg did	N	00:28:23.427
423	yeah he knows stuff	N	00:28:24.442

435	it is	N	00:29:18.254
436	it 's also a powerful sedative	N	00:29:20.196
437	could be what was used to subdue him	N	00:29:21.951
438	you know anybody in town that would use this	N	00:29:24.134
439	uh weed and speed are the drugs of choice around here	N	00:29:27.814
440	hey doc take a look at the scope will you	N	00:29:30.314

557	well if i believe this was his first and only visit how do we explain the leaves in his closet	N	00:36:21.775
558	he has a roommate	Y	00:36:25.605
559	does the roommate have a name	Y	00:36:27.434
