399	were you expecting some	N	00:20:30.984
400	well she was wrapped in a bloody blanket	N	00:20:33.663
401	since there 's no trauma maybe the blood belongs to her killer	Y	00:20:37.164
402	roll her	N	00:20:40.242
403	look at those marks	N	00:20:44.435
404	there was nothing underneath her at the crime scene that uh would 've made those	N	00:20:47.051
405	well maybe she was moved	N	00:20:49.226
406	trunk of car	N	00:20:50.625
407	tire iron	N	00:20:52.024

413	she was the same age as lindsay	N	00:21:32.875
414	she was trying to hitchhike	N	00:21:35.333
415	where was she going	N	00:21:39.326

420	she 's just so angry	N	00:21:53.815
421	she does n't talk to me	N	00:21:56.312
422	well if enough people knew what was out there hunting them they 'd never leave their house	N	00:22:00.201
423	i think you need to sit her down	N	00:22:05.475
424	well i do n't want to scare her	N	00:22:08.012
425	i do n't want my daughter to be this frightened paranoid kid who 's always looking over her shoulder	N	00:22:12.506
426	catherine there 's a big difference between scaring her and preparing her	N	00:22:17.866
427	and all the reasons why you should are in that room	N	00:22:23.066
428	what is all this bone scarring	N	00:22:30.831
429	i thought you should be interested	N	00:22:32.514
430	twelve holes exactly made by a large bore needle	N	00:22:34.249
431	marrow harvest	N	00:22:37.665
432	young alicia donated bone marrow at least twice	N	00:22:39.463
433	pretty selfless thing to do once considering how painful the procedure is	N	00:22:43.143
434	let me ask you what most likely causes shortness of breath obvious bruising sudden nosebleeds petechiae	N	00:22:49.961
435	sounds like acute leukemia but without immunophenotyping i could n't tell you what kind	N	00:22:59.781
436	alicia 's cause of death	N	00:23:03.626
437	cardiopulmonary arrest	N	00:23:05.264
438	time of death	N	00:23:06.756
439	that 's a little trickier	N	00:23:07.774
440	no solids in the stomach contents just a milky liquid	N	00:23:09.903
441	liver mortis was fixed and deep purple with a vitreous humor potassium level of 20 millimoles per liter with faint putrefaction	N	00:23:15.286
442	so i 'd say she 's been dead about 44 hours between midnight and 8:00 a.m the day of her kidnapping	N	00:23:21.863
443	which means aprilperez was lying about the abduction	N	00:23:26.063
444	yep	N	00:23:28.335
445	story 's got more holes than her sister 's bones	N	00:23:29.791
446	i bought it the hell we all bought it	N	00:23:31.944
447	but your sister was already dead when you raised that alarm	N	00:23:34.496
448	her body told us that	N	00:23:36.754
449	there was no sexual assault	N	00:23:38.994
450	the evidence told us that too	N	00:23:40.888
451	so you did n't think this through sweetheart	N	00:23:43.122

620	i guess they did n't want her complaining while they were mining her body for healthy cells	N	00:33:59.485

637	always thought they were nuts for standing out in traffic but	N	00:34:34.044
638	look familiar	N	00:34:41.043
639	looks like the lividity marks on alicia 's body	N	00:34:45.126
640	i do n't get you man	N	00:34:48.716
641	i mean even if you could explain it i would never understand how you could stuff your daughter in the trunk of your car and dump her body in the woods	N	00:34:53.827
642	i had to protect my family	Y	00:34:59.564
643	was n't alicia part of your family	Y	00:35:01.959
644	you 're her father you dumb bastard	N	00:35:04.515
645	you 're supposed to protect her	N	00:35:06.893
646	what kind of man are you	N	00:35:10.005
647	guilty	N	00:35:11.843
648	you know we got enough evidence to charge you with premeditated murder	N	00:35:16.141
649	you do n't have any proof i killed my daughter	N	00:35:19.205
650	you helped your husband move the body	N	00:35:21.281
651	you know i really do n't see him taking her underpants off so that job was left to you	N	00:35:24.261

658	you run the house	N	00:35:39.822
659	you run the family	N	00:35:40.917
660	people do what you say in a crisis	N	00:35:42.011
661	so	N	00:35:43.367
662	so this time alicia said no	N	00:35:44.647
663	she wanted to keep her kidney and that pissed you off	N	00:35:47.324
664	so you killed her	N	00:35:50.906
665	that 's ridiculous	N	00:35:52.305
666	she was angry she wanted to play on the soccer team she wanted a life	N	00:35:54.646
667	alicia got angry sometimes	N	00:35:57.032
668	just sick of it	N	00:35:58.522
669	we all did	N	00:36:00.012
670	but she 'd have been devastated if daniel had died and she did nothing to prevent it	Y	00:36:03.441
671	she loved her brother	Y	00:36:08.064
672	and you 're just the type of woman that would never let her forget it	N	00:36:10.260
673	come on alicia wanted out of this game and you could n't let that happen	N	00:36:15.442
674	not to daniel not to your only son your favorite child	Y	00:36:19.622
675	you slipped alicia some of daniel 's oxycodone	Y	00:36:24.466
676	alicia	N	00:36:28.386
677	time for your pills	N	00:36:30.821
678	so now you got a problem you had a dead body in the house and no plausible explanation	N	00:36:37.875
679	what are you gon na do	N	00:36:40.333
680	so you call your daughter april	N	00:36:43.246
681	you make up a story you play your roles and put on a show	N	00:36:46.284
682	wait	N	00:36:49.964
683	we have to do this right	N	00:36:51.079
684	oh you know i-i thought the uh the slap was a nice touch	N	00:36:57.545
685	i have a confirmation	N	00:37:04.756
686	those blue fibers are consistent with the blanket that the girl was wrapped in and the shoe prints that i found at the scene they 're a match to the father 's work boots	N	00:37:09.855
687	i re-tested the t-shirt and the blanket	N	00:37:13.696
688	the blood still matches aliciaperez	N	00:37:15.954
689	the evidence supports this unless you 'd like to second-guess that also	N	00:37:20.464
690	i just expect things to be done correctly greg	N	00:37:24.406
691	we all have to learn how to accept change	N	00:37:26.945
692	mia 's doing a great job	N	00:37:29.116
693	it would be nice if someone other than me said so	N	00:37:31.175
694	you 're right	N	00:37:34.074
695	what about the handkerchief	N	00:37:35.650
696	i compared that to the other blood evidence	N	00:37:37.926
697	it 's also match to the victim	N	00:37:40.566
698	i did n't realize until today how lucky i am	Y	00:38:09.423
699	i know pretty much how and when i 'm gon na die	Y	00:38:21.245
700	most people do n't	N	00:38:26.784
701	it 's what they 're afraid of	N	00:38:29.264
702	was your sister afraid	Y	00:38:34.042
703	never	N	00:38:38.505
704	i 'm 11 years older than her and she took care of me	Y	00:38:43.763
705	she was my best friend and i miss her	Y	00:38:49.944
706	as much pain as	N	00:38:59.882
707	i caused her and she would n't give up and she she would n't let me either	Y	00:39:06.442
708	that 's why during the last relapse i made my parents swear that it was the very last time	Y	00:39:17.644
709	but then your kidneys failed and they broke their word huh	Y	00:39:22.542
710	they told me they swore not to fight the cancer so this did n't count	Y	00:39:27.444
711	i was n't gon na lose this fight	Y	00:39:33.945
712	here you go	N	00:39:39.675
713	makes it better	N	00:39:41.011
714	oh my god	N	00:39:45.185
715	please	N	00:39:47.366
716	we have to call the police	N	00:39:48.893
717	they 'll put him in prison	Y	00:39:48.925
718	i could n't watch her suffer anymore	Y	00:39:50.161
719	this was n't a mercy killing daniel	Y	00:39:52.846
720	this was an execution	N	00:39:55.561
721	bone marrow transfusions that 's her blood in your veins	Y	00:40:01.642
722	it dripped out of your nose onto the blanket while you were killing her	Y	00:40:12.922
723	if you cared so much for alicia why did n't you take your own life instead of hers	Y	00:40:20.783
724	suicide is n't an option	N	00:40:25.344
725	it 's an unforgivable sin in the eyes of god	N	00:40:27.620
726	but you believe your god forgives murder	Y	00:40:30.986
727	if that 's your defense it wo n't keep you out of jail	Y	00:40:35.464
728	but my death will	Y	00:40:40.122
729	see i 've got about six more months	Y	00:40:45.021
730	i 'll be dead before there 's even a trial	Y	00:40:49.701
731	i-i do want to thank you though	Y	00:40:58.544
732	for what	N	00:41:00.856
733	for speaking for alicia	N	00:41:02.955
734	you 're probably the first person in her life to think only of her	N	00:41:06.964
735	you know you may not believe in god sir but you do his work	N	00:41:13.644
