416	tammy 's in black adam was the one in blue and that leaves us darin	Y	00:26:00.017
417	we found darin and tammy 's prints at the convenience store	Y	00:26:04.557
418	hours before the heist gets murdered	N	00:26:07.656
419	shot with the same gun used to kill adam at the casino	Y	00:26:12.534
420	the surveillance video tells us that darin was the only one in position to shoot adam	Y	00:26:16.778
421	why did darin kill adam	Y	00:26:21.619

430	so who killed him and where 's the money	Y	00:26:40.298
431	and we still do n't know why darin and tammy took out the convenience store clerk	Y	00:26:44.635
432	why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you 're about to steal a hundred thousand	N	00:26:48.858
433	we 've got more questions than answers	N	00:26:51.858
434	i just got off the phone with the laughlin csi assigned to last month 's cottage casino case	N	00:26:54.995
435	he told me the casino 's cameras captured four assailants not three	N	00:26:59.617
436	maybe tower club surveillance missed something	N	00:27:02.847
437	actually it did n't	N	00:27:04.383
438	we did	N	00:27:06.520

480	i did n't kill anyone	Y	00:29:04.184
481	you forget about darinhanson	Y	00:29:05.953
482	your car was covered with gray dust- silica	Y	00:29:08.019
483	it places you at the murder scene	Y	00:29:12.978
484	well i did n't kill him	Y	00:29:14.505
485	max	Y	00:29:15.437
486	i went there but	Y	00:29:16.370
487	i 'm advising you not to say another word	Y	00:29:17.699
488	no i want to clear this up	Y	00:29:19.257

493	i told him when and where to hit	Y	00:29:33.935
494	that 's why i ducked	Y	00:29:36.297
495	but that 's it	N	00:29:37.853
496	that 's a lot	N	00:29:39.196
497	and it still does n't explain why you went to see darin	Y	00:29:41.837
498	max that is enough	Y	00:29:44.478
499	well i went to collect my share but the money was gone	Y	00:29:45.917
500	darin was dead and i panicked but i did n't shoot him	Y	00:29:49.136
501	you ca n't get me for murder on this	Y	00:29:53.976
502	when someone is killed during the commission of a felony all the conspirators are liable	Y	00:29:57.674
503	darinhanson shot adambrower but you might as well have pulled the trigger	Y	00:30:02.116
504	let 's make a deal	N	00:30:08.338
505	tell me who else was involved	N	00:30:09.916
506	who killed darin	Y	00:30:11.857
507	look darin was the only one that i spoke to	Y	00:30:14.455
508	i never even met the other three	Y	00:30:19.433
509	then we got no deal	Y	00:30:21.595
510	officer	N	00:30:23.475

514	he confirmed a fourth	Y	00:30:43.394
515	darin plus three	Y	00:30:45.036
516	just like laughlin	N	00:30:46.458
517	so the last man standing killed darin	Y	00:30:48.176
518	and he 's still out there flush with cash and a 45 caliber	Y	00:30:51.917
519	surveillance stills from the laughlin heist	N	00:30:56.995
520	four perps we 've identified three darintammy and adam	Y	00:30:59.974

522	yeah	N	00:31:03.118
523	all murdered	N	00:31:03.971
524	that leaves one	N	00:31:04.858
525	i.d	N	00:31:05.614
526	the unknown good chance we solve both cases laughlin and vegas	N	00:31:08.138
527	except all we got is a gun in drag	N	00:31:11.433
528	well that 's why i 'm here	N	00:31:13.834
529	i 've divided the photo into segments removed the disguise and rebuilt the original image based on male physiological norms	N	00:31:20.694
530	now it 's not exact but you 'll have an idea of what your guy looks like	N	00:31:25.694
531	that 's dustinbale	N	00:31:35.779
532	the clerk from the convenience store	N	00:31:37.408
533	whoa	N	00:31:38.944
534	hold on	N	00:31:40.507
535	he was killed hours before the tower club heist	N	00:31:41.923
536	in on laughlin out on vegas	N	00:31:43.835
537	so darin took him out first	Y	00:31:46.256
538	they cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery	Y	00:31:49.015
539	but the pit boss said it was darin plus three	Y	00:31:51.878
540	because he knew there were four at the laughlin heist	Y	00:31:54.638
541	well maybe he did n't know that the clerk was n't there	Y	00:31:57.176
542	he was n't counting wigs	Y	00:31:59.718
543	he was hiding under a blackjack table	Y	00:32:02.115
544	and we 're back to who killed darinhanson	Y	00:32:04.138
545	bobby d	N	00:32:07.748
546	yeah	N	00:32:08.527
547	we need your help	N	00:32:09.779
548	another round from the casino heist	N	00:32:13.035
549	indirectly yeah	N	00:32:14.876
550	well tip did n't blossom	N	00:32:20.256
551	not a hollow point so it 's not from darinhanson 's gun	Y	00:32:22.793
552	no it 's from his head	Y	00:32:24.898
553	all right 230 grains gives us a 45 automatic	N	00:32:28.418
554	what else	N	00:32:32.996
555	okay normally lands and grooves are highly delineated	N	00:32:36.255
556	these are smooth polished which means that your projectile was fired from a polygonal barrel	N	00:32:40.795
557	be right back	N	00:32:44.659
558	these are the only types of 45 automatics with polygonal barrels	N	00:32:52.774
559	so the gun that fired your bullet was either a heckler and koch usp or a glock	N	00:32:57.398
560	narrow it further	N	00:33:05.297
561	well that 's what i 'm doing dissecting your bullet	N	00:33:08.918
562	hey nick	N	00:33:10.916
563	mm-hmm	N	00:33:12.031

565	one two three four five six	N	00:33:16.098
566	six lands angroves with a right-hand twist	N	00:33:19.648
567	mm-hmm	N	00:33:21.104
568	glock 's got eight heckler and koch six	N	00:33:23.535
