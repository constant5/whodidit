365	there 's no way i can say that the bullets taken from the victims were fired by jennings 's gun	Y	00:30:31.977
366	so he altered the barrel somehow	Y	00:30:37.537
367	yeah	N	00:30:40.197
368	changed how the bullet relates to the barrel so when the bullet emerges its fine stria are altered	N	00:30:43.598
