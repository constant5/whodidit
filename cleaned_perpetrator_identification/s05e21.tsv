351	yeah	N	00:21:23.004
352	course i would n't expect winnie the pooh	N	00:21:25.702
353	adam 's subconscious was working overtime	N	00:21:30.565
354	i bet you aced your rorschachs	N	00:21:33.505
355	when i was in fifth grade i drew a picture of a harpooned whale	N	00:21:38.003
356	everyone thought i was gonzo d	N	00:21:41.202
357	but i had just read moby dick	N	00:21:43.726
358	sometimes a dying whale is just a dying whale	N	00:21:46.524
359	these are all postdated over a year ago	N	00:22:28.223
360	it 's not just his subconscious	N	00:22:34.625
361	this guy 's got stuff buried everywhere	N	00:22:36.741
362	dearest angel i think of you wherever i go	Y	00:22:41.286
363	you are my prince	Y	00:22:43.546

365	write to me	Y	00:22:46.416
366	your only love mother	Y	00:22:47.394
367	another one	N	00:22:48.985
368	uh it rained today	N	00:22:50.885
369	i thought of that time when you and i got caught in the storm at the lake	Y	00:22:52.481
370	the fire	N	00:22:54.078
371	i came home and made your favorite dinner	Y	00:22:56.036
372	i even set a place for you so on and so forth	Y	00:22:58.016
373	that does not sound maternal to me	N	00:23:00.074
374	it 's not	N	00:23:01.888
375	incest	N	00:23:03.524
376	fully consummated	N	00:23:04.639
377	mother-son incest is rare and deeply pathological	N	00:23:07.363
378	oedipal complex taken too far	N	00:23:10.525
379	oedipus implies son to mother	N	00:23:12.521
380	in this case the mother was seeking the love and creating the codependence	Y	00:23:15.342
381	we call this a jocasta complex	N	00:23:17.875
382	oedipus mother	N	00:23:19.291
383	when adam was nine his father died	N	00:23:21.663
384	his mother replaced her dead husband with her son	Y	00:23:24.345
385	that 's got to mess you up	N	00:23:26.381
386	yeah	N	00:23:28.784
387	adam is schizo-affective suicidal and a pathological narcissist	N	00:23:31.218
388	when he was a teenager he was unable to retaliate against his mother and incapable of actual intimacy so he started raping women	Y	00:23:37.265
389	always women	N	00:23:42.739
390	yes	N	00:23:44.043
391	which is why i do n't think he killed robbie	N	00:23:45.347
392	we found adam 's semen in robbie 's bed	N	00:23:47.264
393	you see that surprises me	N	00:23:49.460
394	like any good psychopath he rarely veers from his pattern adam is a single-celled organism who exists wholly for himself	N	00:23:55.044
395	he must 've been getting something tangible in return	N	00:24:00.167
396	what	N	00:24:01.447
397	drugs	N	00:24:02.946
398	cigarettes	N	00:24:04.345
399	drugs are n't his issue	N	00:24:06.176
400	and as far as i know he does n't smoke	N	00:24:08.116
401	um	N	00:24:12.683
402	so uh what can we learn from his artwork	N	00:24:15.945
403	uh he starts with an innocuous object a tree a cat an oboe all of which he morphs into something deadly	N	00:24:18.286
404	you can see all of them	N	00:24:20.864
405	so what should be safe turns into something unsafe	N	00:24:25.706
406	mother becomes lover	Y	00:24:28.635
407	what about the mother	Y	00:24:29.892
408	do you have any idea where she is	Y	00:24:31.585
409	she lives near reno	Y	00:24:33.383
410	based on the postmarks it seems like she stopped writing him	Y	00:24:36.022
411	every time a letter came a manic episode followed then a severe depression including one suicide attempt	N	00:24:40.486
412	so i started sending the letters back	N	00:24:44.362
413	eventually she stopped writing	Y	00:24:49.825
414	did i kill him	N	00:24:58.766
415	yes	N	00:25:02.506
416	why	N	00:25:04.294
417	he was queer	N	00:25:05.910
418	but you had sex with him	N	00:25:07.905
419	no	N	00:25:13.403
420	he had sex with me	N	00:25:15.166
421	he was the punk	N	00:25:16.764
422	was it consensual	N	00:25:19.345
423	i do n't know	N	00:25:21.222
424	so why did you do it	N	00:25:23.265
425	okay	N	00:25:28.305
426	so then what happened	N	00:25:30.425
427	i took his head and i smashed it into the floor	N	00:25:32.823
428	and that 's how you killed him	N	00:25:38.641
429	what	N	00:25:42.778
430	you do n't believe me	N	00:25:45.323
431	i 'm just wondering if that 's how you killed him	N	00:25:47.405
432	yes	N	00:25:48.064
433	i 'm saying this and this is true	N	00:25:49.298
434	and if you do n't believe me just look in the bucket in the latrine	N	00:25:51.924
435	okay	N	00:25:55.466
436	do you really want to know why i killed him	N	00:25:58.534
437	yes	N	00:26:00.150
438	it 's because i 'm crazy	N	00:26:09.185
439	not a word about suffocation	N	00:26:17.664
440	well his nails were n't long enough to leave those tears in the pillow	N	00:26:20.383
441	and there would have been traces of blood from his cuticles	N	00:26:23.184
442	something is off	N	00:26:25.664
443	well there 's our blood splatter	N	00:26:56.864
444	what is that on the crotch	N	00:26:59.639
445	lipstick	N	00:27:00.922
446	where is nurse mckay	Y	00:27:12.194
447	i need to talk to her	Y	00:27:14.008
448	she 's on lunch duty	Y	00:27:16.042
449	all right	N	00:27:18.336
450	i can either take this and the underwear back to the lab and confirm the match which will only extend our presence here	N	00:27:20.674
451	or you can give me access to the nurse 's station right now	Y	00:27:26.204
452	this must be the photo that nurse mckay confiscated from robbie in group	Y	00:27:38.466
453	the missing half	N	00:27:41.066
454	i found blue tape in robbie 's room	N	00:27:43.863
455	kind of looks like adam	N	00:27:47.494
456	where would robbie get a picture of adam	N	00:27:49.268
457	well they were having sex	N	00:27:51.385
458	i 'm going to find someone who can open these drawers	N	00:28:02.583
459	okay	N	00:28:05.162
460	hey	N	00:28:28.202
461	are you a spiritual person	N	00:28:37.006
462	sometimes	N	00:28:39.306
463	do you believe that everything happens for a reason	N	00:28:41.965
464	that bad things are there to teach us a karmic lesson	N	00:28:45.661
465	you know maybe all our problems can be cured by tuning in to a higher frequency	N	00:28:49.746
466	there 's this one guy i read he believes that illness anxiety and fear all occur when people are vibrating at ten thousand cycles a second	N	00:28:56.704
467	if they could just get up to a hundred thousand cycles per second they 'd be in the realm of sound light and spirit and everything would be just fine	N	00:29:11.766
468	right	N	00:29:14.766
469	yeah	N	00:29:17.561
470	you know what i think	N	00:29:21.066
471	i think i 'm just vibrating at the wrong frequency	N	00:29:23.286
472	do n't	N	00:29:24.806

501	adam	N	00:29:49.231
502	stop	N	00:29:49.613
503	get a medic in here	N	00:29:52.302
504	hold still	N	00:30:00.024
505	apply some pressure	N	00:30:01.258
506	where is it	N	00:30:04.368
507	where is it	N	00:30:04.368
508	we need help in here	Y	00:30:07.138
509	when my father died my mother came to a place like this for a while for evaluation	N	00:30:14.702
510	it looked the same it smelled the same	N	00:30:21.044
511	it smelled like lies	N	00:30:23.359
512	you sure you 're okay	N	00:30:27.784
513	crazy people do make me feel crazy	N	00:30:30.384
514	if you want i can have somebody take your place	N	00:30:35.063
515	i appreciate that	N	00:30:37.984
516	i do i really do but	N	00:30:40.601
517	i 'll be right back	Y	00:30:42.706
518	okay	N	00:30:44.185
519	i kind of made a decision to move beyond that and	N	00:30:46.605
520	i really want to finish this case	N	00:30:49.643
521	we have rules for a reason	Y	00:30:54.125
522	you people come in here disrupting things	N	00:30:56.984
523	you 're unsafe	N	00:30:57.025
524	this is your fault	N	00:30:57.066
525	really	N	00:30:57.874
526	you seem to take your job rather personally	Y	00:30:59.450
527	what are you suggesting	N	00:31:01.365
528	that you had an intimate relationship with adamtrent	Y	00:31:03.282
529	that 's ridiculous	N	00:31:05.266
530	your lipstick is on his underwear	Y	00:31:06.984
531	i gave robbie my lipstick sometimes	Y	00:31:08.759
532	maybe he was wearing it when the whole thing	N	00:31:10.264
533	we did n't find any on his lips	N	00:31:11.769
534	well that 's your problem	N	00:31:13.881
535	what are you waiting for	N	00:31:17.854
536	get him to the medical unit stat	N	00:31:19.549
537	excuse me	N	00:31:52.665
538	adamtrent was working on this piece	N	00:31:54.626
539	yes	N	00:31:56.105
540	he made it on monday	N	00:31:58.161
541	but he never got a chance to fire it	N	00:32:00.784
542	nurse mckay came in they had a conversation	Y	00:32:04.164
543	actually it was more of an argument very heated very loud	N	00:32:08.084
544	and then she yanked him out of class	Y	00:32:17.984
545	was this on the wheel while they were arguing	N	00:32:20.305
546	yeah	N	00:32:22.341
547	adam 's work is very provocative	N	00:32:27.162
548	yeah	N	00:32:29.242
549	it speaks to me	N	00:32:31.646
550	acoustic archeology	N	00:32:34.025
551	in the 60s experiments were done on clay pots and painted canvas	N	00:32:37.305
552	scientists were able to ferret out sounds that were captured during the creative process in the clay and the paint	N	00:32:42.025
553	trippy	N	00:32:45.326
554	it 's actually not that out there	N	00:32:46.924
555	in the old days the first gramophone recordings were made by taking the vibrations of sound and cutting them into wax cylinders while they were turning	N	00:32:52.925
556	based on the frequency and intensity of the sound the stylus cut into the wax creating distinct variances of depth and width	N	00:33:01.823
557	for playback a mechanical transducer vibrated along a groove generating a current which when amplified turned into sound	N	00:33:13.143
558	when the art therapist told me that there 'd been an argument while adam was on the wheel i thought well maybe we can pull some sound off his pot	N	00:33:21.346
559	doppler laser	N	00:33:25.752
560	optical transducer	N	00:33:26.924
561	we 've come a long way	N	00:33:28.096
562	baby	N	00:33:29.706
563	well there 's something there	N	00:33:36.224
564	and it sounds like	N	00:33:39.526
