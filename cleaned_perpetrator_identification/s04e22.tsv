282	not through a betting system but through physics	N	00:17:44.884
283	it 's simple in principle	N	00:17:46.914
284	a fixed mass in a known orbit	N	00:17:50.214
285	as long as you can account for all the forces air resistance friction gravity you can land a probe on mars	N	00:17:54.564
286	well they say that every roulette wheel is a little different	N	00:17:57.863
287	tilt wobble bounce	N	00:18:00.194
288	so the guy with the transmitter does the calibration clocks the position of the ball	N	00:18:05.374
289	hits the switch	N	00:18:08.084
290	and the computer does the rest	N	00:18:11.855
291	plays out the spin in milliseconds	N	00:18:15.294
292	predicts the result	N	00:18:17.068
293	and then transmits a code to the receiver about where that ball will land	N	00:18:18.919
294	all right big money big money	N	00:18:21.744
295	1,000 on four 22 five and 17	N	00:18:23.634
296	it 's number 22	N	00:18:26.974
297	this setup gives you a 44-percent advantage over the house	N	00:18:31.596
298	for every hundred these guys bet they 're pulling in 2,200 an hour	N	00:18:33.132
299	nice return	N	00:18:36.254
300	but it 's a complicated system	N	00:18:40.164
301	complicated huh	N	00:18:42.484
302	maybe for a couple of pizza majors	N	00:18:44.475
303	but not for an electrical engineering grad student	N	00:18:46.945
304	afis got a hit on the print off the transmitter in the shoe	N	00:18:50.734

364	davis freaked	N	00:21:07.924
365	he split	N	00:21:09.644
366	and then when he came out with the money everything was great	N	00:21:12.194
367	for about two seconds	N	00:21:16.294
368	come on pal	N	00:21:17.836

378	sam used to be a caddy man	N	00:21:49.827
379	he would drive a new one every year	N	00:21:51.481
380	these days he 's being driven	N	00:21:53.374
381	and you know this because	N	00:21:55.274

384	and you walked away i hope	N	00:21:59.595
385	i made him walk away from me	N	00:22:01.806
386	right into a stretch limo with a big turning radius	N	00:22:04.301
387	that does n't prove anything	N	00:22:06.747
388	besides any evidence that comes from you is tainted	N	00:22:08.961
389	then have it come from you	N	00:22:10.917
390	warrant should n't be hard to get	N	00:22:12.432

399	i thought that nick was the best candidate for the position	N	00:23:29.194
400	why	N	00:23:34.154
401	because he did n't care whether he got the job or not	N	00:23:38.254
402	that 's a stupid reason	N	00:23:41.835
403	we 've got blood	N	00:23:51.369

414	what do you have	N	00:24:46.955

416	as well as every other limo in vegas	N	00:24:54.894
417	we also found neon glass embedded in all four tires	N	00:24:57.914
418	the whole town 's a construction site	N	00:25:00.757
419	it 's a tenuous link at best	N	00:25:02.352
420	well then how did his blood end up in the back of your client 's limousine	N	00:25:06.494
421	you waited until teddy cleared the security cameras	N	00:25:12.214

432	my client offered the young man a ride home	N	00:25:50.134
433	they stopped briefly at the neon graveyard where they held a private conversation regarding the ethics of defrauding a casino	N	00:25:54.614
434	that must have been some chat	N	00:26:00.274
435	we know he left the casino with the money	N	00:26:02.350
436	the young man returned the money as a sign of respect for my client and his position in the community	N	00:26:05.954

451	the place is a mess of interference	N	00:27:34.109
452	electronics in old casinos are n't shielded	N	00:27:36.934
453	so you 're saying that the shoe computers would 've worked better in one of the new casinos on the strip	N	00:27:40.854
454	definitely	N	00:27:43.935

517	why 'd you use him to settle an old score	Y	00:31:36.642
518	maybe sambraun 's innocent	N	00:31:39.039
519	maybe seth whacked his partners because he got caught	N	00:31:42.170
520	stop looking at my son	Y	00:31:45.014
521	stop looking at me and start looking at sam	Y	00:31:50.595
522	garbage detail called it in says they did n't touch it	N	00:31:58.354
523	well this is sethlanders dorm	N	00:32:04.174
524	there 's a lot of garbage build up	N	00:32:07.514
525	when was the last pick-up	N	00:32:08.704
526	day before yesterday	N	00:32:10.304
527	end of finals party last night	N	00:32:12.114
528	looks like blood	N	00:32:13.986
529	let 's hope the killer left his dna behind	Y	00:32:15.721
530	22 revolver two live rounds four expended	N	00:32:19.294
531	should be able to pull some prints off it	N	00:32:22.394
532	gun 's a relic	N	00:32:24.787
533	does n't matter if it still works	N	00:32:26.522
534	there you go	N	00:32:40.675
535	the test fire matches the bullet found in teddykeller 's body	N	00:32:51.794
536	so we 've got our murder weapon	N	00:32:54.294
537	yeah we found our murder weapon	N	00:32:56.414
538	i do n't know the kid thinks up this elaborate scheme to cheat the casinos	N	00:32:59.434
539	then he kills his partners	N	00:33:02.934
540	but he dumps his gun at his dorm	N	00:33:06.714
541	an rg 22	N	00:33:08.865
542	that 's not a very bad ass first weapon of choice	N	00:33:10.755
543	no it 's a small caliber weapon for an up-close-and-personal hit	N	00:33:13.634
544	i do n't really see the kid pulling a gotti	N	00:33:17.706
545	okay two victims two taps to the head	N	00:33:19.042
546	but the loads are different	N	00:33:22.975
547	well maybe he ran out of ammo	Y	00:33:24.716
548	went back and bought another brand	N	00:33:26.072
549	and reloaded yeah	N	00:33:27.654
550	the bullets that were found in teddykeller 's skull were copper washed cci 22s	N	00:33:33.234
551	and the two rounds found in davismullins were remington brass washed	N	00:33:38.314
552	so based on the position of the cylinder remingtons were fired first	N	00:33:43.494
553	but that would mean that davismullins was killed in the apartment before teddykeller was killed in the graveyard	N	00:33:56.119
554	the timeline 's off	N	00:33:59.534
555	blood on the shirt is a match to davismullins	N	00:34:03.335
