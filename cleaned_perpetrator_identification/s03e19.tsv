309	uh-huh from one of the showgirls	N	00:30:50.841
310	kellygoodson	Y	00:30:54.489
311	she claims that he threatened to fire her if she did n't perform certain sexual favors	Y	00:30:57.090
312	you know she had a business card in her locker langly and langly attorneys-at-law	Y	00:31:01.994
313	it 'd be interesting to find out	N	00:31:05.786
314	if audrey hired the same firm	N	00:31:07.281
315	she did	N	00:31:08.874
316	so they liked the same movies they had the same problem and they hired the same lawyer	Y	00:31:14.314
317	knees bothering you	N	00:31:18.449
318	the extension cord used to strangle audreyhilden	N	00:31:25.714
319	the dentist 's gold chain	N	00:31:28.655
320	the murderer 's gloves	Y	00:31:31.954
321	well any physical evidence on those gloves would 've been compromised by the ammonia	N	00:31:35.195
322	only on the inside not necessarily the outside	N	00:31:38.954
323	you use two hands to put on gloves	N	00:31:42.655
324	you 're looking for transfer	N	00:31:44.874
325	special recipe	N	00:31:47.069
326	langly and langly	N	00:36:29.215
327	mm	N	00:36:30.617
328	i 'm sorry	Y	00:36:31.414
329	oh it 's the law firm that both you and audrey hired to deal with your problems gus sugarman and anthonyhaines	Y	00:36:35.255
330	tonyhaines is a pig but who 's gus	N	00:36:39.294
331	well we 're guessing that that 's where the two of you first met at the lawyers	Y	00:36:44.894
332	or they could 've met at the movie theater	Y	00:36:48.394
333	right	N	00:36:50.516
334	right	N	00:36:50.516
335	i mean either way you ladies had a lot in common	Y	00:36:56.235
336	boy ca n't you see them watching strangers on a train together	Y	00:37:00.015
337	oh yeah	N	00:37:02.614
338	i 'm thinking that audrey told her everything about her dentist and she told audrey everything about haines	Y	00:37:06.234
339	you needed them both dead	Y	00:37:10.374
340	so right out of strangers on a train if you swapped murders no one could tie you to the victims and then you started talking specifics	Y	00:37:19.455
341	where the best place would be to kill haines	N	00:37:29.455
342	someplace dark secluded the parking lot right here at the sphere	N	00:37:39.029
343	after you stabbed sugarman you ripped the gold chain off of his neck as proof that you 'd kept up your end of the bargain	Y	00:37:47.913
344	and then you walked out into the lobby and called audrey on the pay phone to say that the deed was done	Y	00:37:58.455
345	and then audrey called sugarman three times in a row to see if it was true	N	00:38:02.854
346	she was the one who picked the movie and made the date	N	00:38:07.104
347	but that 's all she did is n't it	N	00:38:12.034
348	cause just like in the movie she had no intention of killing haines and that 's when you started harassing her	Y	00:38:16.909
349	you 'd killed for her	Y	00:38:26.035
350	now she was n't holding up her end of the bargain	N	00:38:28.395
351	you could n't let her betray you	Y	00:38:30.706
352	so unfortunately she had to die too	N	00:38:32.841
353	so you made it look like she 'd committed suicide and then you planted sugarman 's gold chain in hopes that we would think that she killed him too	Y	00:38:47.089
354	the only thing that she had on you was that movie schedule	Y	00:38:53.074
355	that had to go	N	00:38:56.094
356	wow that is a really good story	N	00:39:03.994
357	you guys must be movie fans yourselves	N	00:39:06.754
358	you 're right	Y	00:39:09.366
359	it 's just a story	N	00:39:10.902
360	but the chemicals that we found on your gloves and on the extension cord that was used to kill audrey that 's our proof	Y	00:39:17.455
361	menthol trolamine salicylate capsaicin	N	00:39:24.814
362	eucalyptabalm isorcreme capsaicin ointment a unique concoction your unique concoction and this stuff is all over the evidence	Y	00:39:39.114
363	yeah it 's a pretty good movie	N	00:39:49.989
364	well the character that you 've been playing the character that robert walker played in the movie dies at the end	Y	00:39:53.334
365	i said he 'd be alone	N	00:39:58.094
366	hi	N	00:40:10.554
