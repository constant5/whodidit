341	it matches your perfume	N	00:31:27.875
342	a high-end woman 's perfume	N	00:31:29.857
343	it 's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it	N	00:31:32.495
344	wait wait wait she has no reason to hurt barryschickel	N	00:31:35.439
345	what about revenge for her little brother	N	00:31:38.075
