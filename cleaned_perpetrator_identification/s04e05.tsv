222	maybe we just ask him where the hip young plushy-on-the-go likes to hang out	N	00:27:01.614
223	password please	N	00:27:28.115
224	e-i-e-i-o	N	00:27:30.855
225	this is a private party	N	00:27:32.574
226	uh we have an invitation from the lasvegas police department	N	00:27:35.249
227	uh okay	N	00:27:38.674
228	whoa nellie	N	00:27:54.835
229	is this a raid	N	00:27:58.827
230	it 's a homicide investigation	N	00:28:00.562
231	look we need you to stop skritching or yiffing or whatever take off your costumes and tell us your names	N	00:28:05.414
232	ooh	N	00:28:19.437
233	these costumes are pretty marinated	N	00:28:21.031
234	smokey could 've used some deodorant	N	00:28:22.955
235	well you know pheromones are the basis for mammalian reproduction	N	00:28:26.534
236	when the female is in estrus the male picks up on her come-get-me scent	N	00:28:30.334
237	but most mammals only copulate seasonally	N	00:28:36.175
238	how boring	N	00:28:38.794
239	for some	N	00:28:40.294
240	no one else in that furpile threw up right	N	00:28:46.374
241	uh rocky was a target	N	00:28:49.655
242	smell this	N	00:29:00.175
243	civet oil and ipecac	N	00:29:10.394
244	so i guess we 're looking for a wolf in wolf 's clothing	N	00:29:15.435
245	mr lee the concentration of ipecac and civet oil on your paws speaks to application rather than accidental transfer	N	00:29:22.274
246	okay	N	00:29:25.647
247	fine	N	00:29:27.022
248	i	N	00:29:28.774
249	i mixed up some ipecac and some civet oil and i-i	N	00:29:32.954
250	i rubbed it on sexy	N	00:29:37.535
251	sexy kitty	N	00:29:45.815
252	why sexy kitty	N	00:29:46.830
253	cause rocky could n't get enough of her	N	00:29:47.894
254	what did rocky do to you	N	00:29:49.666
255	he 's a raccoon	N	00:29:50.921
256	they 're all lowlifes	N	00:29:54.236
257	i mean honestly what do they do	N	00:29:56.072
258	screw eat garbage screw some more	N	00:29:59.415
259	is this a uh general observation or possibly a personal grievance	N	00:30:06.674
260	at last year 's convention rocky stole my girlfriend	N	00:30:13.874
261	and in the wild wolves are monogamous but raccoons are promiscuous	N	00:30:18.615
262	that 's right	N	00:30:21.914
263	and i just i knew i knew since sexy kitty was rocky 's fave he 'd have his filthy raccoon mouth all over her again this year	N	00:30:29.235
264	all i wanted to do was make him sick enough so that he 'd have to go home and stop cheating on my mate	N	00:30:37.654
265	your ex-mate	N	00:30:41.275
266	yes	N	00:30:43.775
267	i could n't take seeing what that wanna-be marsupial put her through	N	00:30:47.955
268	my linda lamb deserved better	N	00:30:51.454
269	mr lee you 're a wolf	N	00:30:53.935
270	how 'd you end up with a lamb	N	00:30:56.014
271	i used to work with linda	N	00:30:58.094
272	and one day i found out about what she did on the weekends	N	00:31:02.534
273	and she helped me become who i am	N	00:31:08.855
274	i always knew that i was a something else	N	00:31:13.494
275	and linda made it real	N	00:31:20.735
276	she was one of a kind	N	00:31:26.614
277	does uh linda lamb have a human last name	N	00:31:30.834
278	jones	N	00:31:34.806
279	why	N	00:31:35.781
280	lindajones is linda lamb	N	00:31:47.359
281	damn it	N	00:31:49.287
282	this was here the whole time	N	00:31:50.422
283	yeah but evidence without context is not evidence	N	00:31:52.877
284	we had no reason to search the trunk	N	00:31:54.871
285	so she did n't just hit rocky she knew him	N	00:31:57.295
286	for the philandering raccoon that he was	N	00:32:00.855
287	okay assuming that linda and bob were heading home after bob got sick at the hotel how did he end up on the side of the road	N	00:32:11.214
288	you ever have a car fight	N	00:32:18.334
289	you know if a couple has any kind of history together they know how to press each other 's buttons	N	00:32:22.594
290	and you lock em up in a metal box with wheels on a bad night they 're going to start pressing em	N	00:32:27.574
291	you follow	N	00:32:31.195
292	so uh either bob told linda to stop the car and let him out or she told him to start walking	N	00:32:35.149
293	yes	N	00:32:38.374
294	that one	N	00:32:42.096
295	i mean it 's bad enough that raccoon-boy blows his girlfriend off to go fur-piling he gets sick licking some nasty kitty and makes lambchop drive him home	N	00:32:46.051
296	which begs the question why did she turn the car around and head back toward the hotel	N	00:32:53.494
297	well she was n't heading back to the hotel	N	00:32:56.797
298	she was heading back for him	N	00:32:58.392
299	cause that 's how car-fights always end	N	00:33:00.394
300	after about a mile or two you start to feel guilty that you 've abandoned the person and you turn around	N	00:33:04.254
301	except she did n't plan on an 18-wheeler finishing her off	N	00:33:08.355
302	mack truck ex machina	N	00:33:10.814
303	but it still does n't explain how bob got shot in the back	N	00:33:15.894
304	no but i think i may know the last person who saw them alive	N	00:33:19.394
305	why do n't we ask the valet if he saw some furriest conventioneers	N	00:33:25.894
306	damn straight i remember them	N	00:34:14.934
307	how often do you see a six-foot raccoon heaving out a car window	N	00:34:17.634
308	dude was hammered man	N	00:34:21.277
309	his girl she was pissed	N	00:34:23.271
310	thank you	N	00:34:24.847
311	you 've been very helpful	N	00:34:25.821
312	all right no problem	N	00:34:26.877
313	hey i got that	N	00:34:27.831
314	so there 's your car-fight	N	00:34:29.934
315	now she thinks that he 's back on the booze which he denies but the sicker he gets the more she this he 's lying	N	00:34:34.694
316	i ca n't believe you 're drinking again you promised	N	00:34:38.316
317	i was not drinking	N	00:34:39.832
318	must be food poisoning	N	00:34:46.085
319	oh	N	00:34:47.455
320	did n't know they served food in a furpile	N	00:34:48.825
321	the righteously angry versus the wrongly accused	N	00:34:51.094
322	and the battle 's just beginning	N	00:34:53.525
323	would you just take off the mask and talk to me	N	00:34:55.137
324	no just pull over and let me out of the car	N	00:34:58.184
325	you want out	N	00:34:59.935
326	ah	N	00:35:02.590
327	get out	N	00:35:05.487
328	just get out	N	00:35:06.701
329	okay so it makes sense up to that point but then what	N	00:35:08.235
330	he gets out and she shoots him	N	00:35:11.094
331	i 'm not so sure that people who dress up like cuddly forest creatures carry guns	N	00:35:14.589
332	you do n't think they allow plushies in the nra	N	00:35:18.454
333	all right then who shot him	N	00:35:21.424
334	well we have a grassy knoll but no lee harvey oswald	N	00:35:23.904
335	hey grissom	N	00:36:40.214
336	over here	N	00:36:41.526
337	i found the bullet	N	00:36:42.421
338	well done	N	00:36:53.786
339	so we got a sick raccoon with an abdominal through-and-through who was shot from what appears to be a fairly steep trajectory	N	00:36:58.161
340	so either he was shot by a giant or he was uh on all fours	N	00:37:04.674
341	or both	N	00:37:13.025
342	i mean imagine looked like out here at night and from a distance	N	00:37:21.714
343	we 've been looking for a person who shot a person but maybe we should be looking for a person who shot an animal	N	00:37:33.449
344	how you doing	N	00:38:46.447
345	can i help you	Y	00:38:47.502
346	we 're with the lasvegas crime lab	N	00:38:48.816
347	this your place	Y	00:38:50.211
348	yeah	N	00:38:51.651
349	must be here about that accident	N	00:38:52.954
350	terrible thing	N	00:38:54.257
351	like i said to the wife the way these 18-wheelers fly down here ballin the jack i ai n't surprised	Y	00:38:56.795
352	i 'm surprised there ai n't more accidents	Y	00:38:59.624
353	why do n't you give us a brief history of your evening	Y	00:39:02.874
354	ah well i had dinner with the missus	Y	00:39:05.294
355	uh fed the scraps to the dogs	N	00:39:07.374
356	watched jeopardy	N	00:39:10.354
357	could hardly hear it the dogs were uh so stirred up	N	00:39:12.995
358	went outside to take a look spotted a coyote	N	00:39:15.900
359	this is my business	N	00:39:18.958
360	purebreds	N	00:39:20.074
361	would n't want to lose one	N	00:39:21.191
362	so i uh took care of it	Y	00:39:22.935
363	came back inside in time for final jeopardy	N	00:39:25.714
364	so the raccoon was mistaken for a coyote	N	00:39:31.094
365	you got ta be kidding me	N	00:39:32.904
366	he was dosed intentionally but killed accidentally	N	00:39:36.914
367	we got the ranger 's rifle we collected a bullet at the scene and ballistics made a match	Y	00:39:41.229
368	bobpitt was sick when he got out of the car wounded when he got onto the road and dead when he hit the dirt	N	00:39:47.034
369	get out	N	00:39:50.887
370	just get out	N	00:39:51.861
371	well the rancher 's going to get off linda 's dead and wolfie skates with a misdemeanor	Y	00:40:18.884
372	we took one look at those furry suits and thought foul play but this was really just a domestic dispute gone mad	N	00:40:25.890
373	hmm	N	00:40:30.005
374	fur and loathing in lasvegas	N	00:40:31.894
