365	i choose men who are emotionally unavailable	N	00:23:31.047

368	have you ever gone a week without a rationalization	N	00:23:39.443
369	it 's from the big chill	N	00:23:50.263
370	one of the characters explaining a basic fact of life that rationalizations are more important to us than sex even	N	00:23:51.823
371	i am not rationalizing anything	N	00:23:54.024
372	i crossed the line with catherine and i was insubordinate to ecklie	N	00:23:58.183
373	why	N	00:24:01.624
374	leave it alone	N	00:24:02.699

379	there was a smell of iron in the air	N	00:24:22.724
380	cast-off on the bedroom wall	N	00:24:27.903
381	there was this young cop puking his guts	N	00:24:31.205
382	i remember the woman who took me to foster care	N	00:24:35.605
383	i ca n't remember her name	N	00:24:38.624
384	which is strange you know cause i could n't let go of her hand	N	00:24:45.604
385	well the mind has its filters	N	00:24:52.322
386	i do remember the looks	N	00:24:54.806
387	i became the girl whose father was stabbed to death	N	00:24:59.523
388	do you think there 's a murder gene	N	00:25:08.103
389	i do n't believe that genes are a predictor of violent behavior	N	00:25:13.803
390	you would n't know that in my house	N	00:25:18.246
391	the fights the yelling the trips to the hospital	N	00:25:21.474
392	i thought it was the way that everybody lived	N	00:25:23.129
393	when my mother killed my father i found out that it was n't	N	00:25:25.941
394	so the tar from your carpet matches the tar that svetlanamelton was buried in	N	00:25:32.344

411	did n't sound like her	N	00:27:06.125
412	she usually called me kenski	N	00:27:08.281
413	so what was your relationship kenski	N	00:27:10.452
414	what was my relationship	N	00:27:12.302
415	my relationship was uh we were uh we were in love	N	00:27:14.153
416	how did her husband feel about that	Y	00:27:20.127
417	her husband bought her so he thought he owned her	Y	00:27:22.855
418	and svetlana was way out of his league	Y	00:27:25.432
419	and what she wanted to do was fast track her divorce	N	00:27:28.056
420	so she thought maybe if she made it look like andrew had beat her that that would do it but that did n't do it because he 'd actually never hit her	Y	00:27:30.394
421	so	N	00:27:33.564
422	how 'd she break her jaw	N	00:27:36.562
423	huh	N	00:27:41.482
424	she begged me	N	00:27:46.144
425	please kenski	N	00:27:48.544
426	please	N	00:27:50.740
427	hit me hard on face	N	00:27:53.224
428	it is only way for me to leave this horrible man	Y	00:27:56.563
429	please kenski	N	00:27:59.625
430	hit me if you love me	N	00:28:03.126
431	i just loved her	N	00:28:17.185
432	all of the blood on svetlana 's sweatshirt was hers	N	00:28:33.924
433	nothing from kenwellstone	N	00:28:37.002
434	no but some of the drops look a lot like dried blood but they came back aubergine sheen number 315 professional grade hair dye	N	00:28:39.304
435	well she worked in a hair salon	N	00:28:45.406
436	yeah	N	00:28:47.874
437	some of the patterns look a lot like cast-off	N	00:28:49.529
438	hair dye was present when she was being attacked	N	00:28:52.006
439	ken still could have done it	N	00:28:54.855
440	true but his story is so absurd i almost buy it	N	00:28:57.273
441	yeah well admit the punch and you go to jail for a night	N	00:28:59.784
442	admit the killing and you go to jail for life	N	00:29:02.060
443	find anything you like buddy	N	00:29:04.402
444	so you ca n't sell your kids but you can buy their mother	N	00:29:07.262
445	i looking for kindest noble man well i got news for you sugar pants	N	00:29:10.623
446	buying women ai n't that noble	N	00:29:14.005
447	well life is short	N	00:29:16.520
448	dating 's complicated	N	00:29:17.866
449	this makes it much simpler does n't it	N	00:29:19.212
450	it 's not supposed to be simple	N	00:29:21.005
451	complicated is the whole point	N	00:29:22.922
452	it is	N	00:29:24.425
453	yeah	N	00:29:25.181
454	hey wait a minute	N	00:29:26.495
455	you 're not telling me you 're into this stuff	N	00:29:28.031
456	me	N	00:29:30.499
457	no	N	00:29:33.563
458	but you know for a guy who 's over 40 lonely tired of the bar scene got a little cash wants to buy himself a sweet honey be his companion	N	00:29:36.628
459	he needs a translator cause you 're not even speaking the same language	N	00:29:39.982
460	that 's the best part	N	00:29:42.375
461	ugh	N	00:29:43.513
462	best part of what	N	00:29:47.465
463	what 's all this about	N	00:29:51.814
464	we have reason to believe svetlanamelton was murdered in your salon	N	00:29:53.430
465	we have a search warrant	N	00:29:55.641
466	let them in	N	00:30:03.670
467	jagged on one side smooth on the other	N	00:30:21.546
468	i got blood spatter next to the hair dye	N	00:30:47.165
469	svetlana was a tall girl	N	00:30:49.896
470	spatter looks a little low	N	00:30:51.995
471	maybe she was sitting	N	00:30:54.242
472	these chairs do n't match	N	00:30:56.727
473	i think somebody 's hiding something	N	00:31:03.965
474	the stain on the chair was aubergine sheen hair dye	N	00:31:12.466
475	dna from the bloodstains on the walls was too degraded and mia could not get a match	N	00:31:18.523
476	so we know who the blood belongs to	N	00:31:21.546
477	we just ca n't prove it	N	00:31:23.025
478	i think we can though	N	00:31:24.865
479	you know some guy was selling a grilled cheese sandwich on ebay for something like 28,000 because he claimed the burn pattern contained the face of the virgin mary	N	00:31:30.943
480	how much you think i can get for the face of svetlana in hair dye	N	00:31:40.785
481	hang on	N	00:31:51.095
482	there 's something else	N	00:31:52.312
483	a recycled love token	N	00:31:59.443
484	now that 's tacky	N	00:32:02.086
485	yeah that is pretty tacky	N	00:32:03.125
486	but it 's cause for a warrant	N	00:32:04.164
487	everything in order	N	00:32:15.504
488	i 'm not giving you a damn thing until i read every last word	Y	00:32:18.166
489	take as long as you want	Y	00:32:20.545
490	we 're going to be here a while	N	00:32:27.426
491	do you believe this	N	00:32:30.350
492	what that the guy locks up his food	Y	00:32:31.451
493	locks his wife out	Y	00:32:32.705
494	you think he 's trying to protect his investment	Y	00:32:34.836
495	weight goes up	N	00:32:36.816
496	value goes down	N	00:32:38.686
497	control her food control her destiny i do n't know	N	00:32:40.125
498	look at this	N	00:32:41.746
499	she ca n't even call out for pizza	N	00:32:43.525
500	or help	N	00:32:45.283
501	the necklace	N	00:32:50.962
502	no no no	N	00:32:52.416
503	no no	N	00:32:53.156
504	i got it	N	00:32:53.895
505	i got it	N	00:32:53.895
506	svetlana 's blood was on the necklace worn by andrewmelton 's current child bride	Y	00:33:40.982
507	could you imagine a control freak like him having to spend the night in jail on a phony abuse charge	Y	00:33:46.465
508	you know he went looking for her when he got out	Y	00:33:49.905
509	he beat her killed her and took back the only thing he valued	Y	00:33:59.686
510	it 'll never stand up rick	N	00:34:06.198
511	you know how it is they 'll say the blood could 've come from anywhere	N	00:34:06.230
512	she could 've left the necklace behind	N	00:34:07.134
513	we need a murder weapon	N	00:34:08.908
514	yeah well good luck on that one	N	00:34:10.936
515	crime 's over two years old	N	00:34:12.876
516	all righty	N	00:34:14.611
517	we know that this guy did it	Y	00:34:15.821
518	how do we prove it	N	00:34:17.031
519	can we prove he buried her	Y	00:34:18.796
520	i 'm not convinced he did	Y	00:34:20.776
521	svetlana was buried in a pre-existing grave	N	00:34:22.916
522	right on top of another girl 's body	N	00:34:24.896
523	and both girls fingertips were removed by blending shears	N	00:34:27.861
524	which we also found at the salon	N	00:34:30.683
525	and the only people with full access to the salon are chloe and vlad	N	00:34:34.104
526	yeah and chloe does n't really seem like the type that gets her hands dirty	N	00:34:38.962
527	all right the relative size of the letters and the spacing between them appear to be consistent with both vlad 's appointment book and the good-bye note left by svetlana	N	00:34:47.265
528	my opinion is it 's the same writer	N	00:34:54.567
529	well it looks like the vladski tricked the kenski	N	00:34:58.123
530	according to your credit card statements you purchased several buckets of tar two and five years ago at a local hardware store	N	00:35:05.605
531	tell me what 's a receptionist at a hair salon doing with that much tar	N	00:35:12.844
532	in russia i work for certain family	N	00:35:16.081
533	when they want body taken care of i go to oil field dump body in tar	N	00:35:19.563
534	none ever found	N	00:35:23.081
535	sounds like fun	N	00:35:25.584
536	tell me about svetlana	N	00:35:27.603
537	girl already dead	N	00:35:29.255
538	nothing i can do	N	00:35:30.711
539	so you 're saying you did not kill her	N	00:35:32.485
540	no	N	00:35:34.243
541	then why 'd you cover it up	N	00:35:36.066
542	svetlana time to lock up	N	00:35:38.605
