333	wendy came to me	N	00:20:19.724
334	she was denied surgery	N	00:20:21.696
335	that 's devastating	N	00:20:23.795
336	i tried to help her work through that	N	00:20:26.355
337	by finding a doctor who would operate on her	N	00:20:29.051
338	by working with her on what made her an unacceptable candidate which was	N	00:20:32.142
339	patience	N	00:20:35.024
340	when was the last time you saw her	N	00:20:38.443
341	last night	N	00:20:40.643
342	7:00 to 8:00 for her individual consultation	N	00:20:40.699
343	how did she seem	N	00:20:41.605

347	i do n't recommend what we call passing i suggested that aaron come at a group	N	00:20:52.921
348	wendy was adamant that he never know the truth	N	00:20:56.505

353	she left her weekly session with dr lavalle at 8:00 p.m here	N	00:21:14.306
354	now officer mann pulled her over on industrial road 24 minutes later	N	00:21:18.244
355	well she was found dead two miles south of there supposedly on her way to her friend mimosa 's house here	N	00:21:21.805
356	takes ten minutes to drive from the clinic to industrial road	N	00:21:25.262
357	yeah	N	00:21:29.322
358	i had greg run it	N	00:21:33.524
359	classic	N	00:21:35.445
360	fourteen minutes of wendy 's time unaccounted for	N	00:21:36.465
361	that 's what i 'm saying	N	00:21:38.421
362	she must 've stopped somewhere between the clinic and where officer mann clocked her doing ninety	N	00:21:42.064
363	somewhere in this highlighted area	N	00:21:45.495
364	yeah but there 's nothing out there	N	00:21:47.031
365	not so fast	N	00:21:48.759
366	sara found this in the medicine cabinet	N	00:21:50.344
367	it 's a post-it	N	00:21:51.929
368	g-105 section e what does that have to do with her medicine cabinet	N	00:21:54.866
369	does n't have anything to do with the medicine cabinet	N	00:21:58.375
370	i thought it was map coordinates or something like that but it 's not	N	00:22:01.111
371	you know what they have a lot of up in this area	N	00:22:05.423
372	storage facilities	N	00:22:14.823
373	what 's the number again	N	00:22:22.226

381	nick hit the lights	N	00:23:14.345
382	oh god	N	00:23:18.184
383	catherine	N	00:23:42.955
384	yeah	N	00:23:44.053
385	what do you think went on here	N	00:23:45.842
386	someone outsourced their health care to the wrong provider	N	00:23:48.964
387	at least something was sterile	N	00:23:58.762
388	maybe why i 'm not getting any prints	N	00:24:03.121
389	hey	N	00:24:05.124
390	hi jim	N	00:24:06.318
391	so i uh	N	00:24:07.604
392	i talked to the manager	N	00:24:08.639
393	all he said was the renter paid cash he was a guy he seemed normal	Y	00:24:12.023
394	normal people do n't torture people in storage bins	N	00:24:16.684
395	piano wires	N	00:24:31.986
396	they 're used to mobilize the lower part of the abdominal skin and anchor the neo-vagina so it can heal in place	N	00:24:35.544
397	i can only imagine those cramps	N	00:24:38.482
398	the surgeon stuffs the portal with a cylinder wrapped in gauze to hold its shape while it heals and sutures it	N	00:24:42.445
399	and how long does milady have to wear a wire	N	00:24:47.062
400	well after five days the virgin is un-sutured and the wires are removed	N	00:24:51.242
401	scarring indicates multiple surgeries	N	00:24:55.143
402	she appears to have gone in for repair due to infection	N	00:24:58.484
403	i take it that was n't supposed to happen	N	00:25:01.505
404	maybe someone was n't taking their hormones	N	00:25:03.621
405	or they were taking some bad mexican bootlegs	N	00:25:06.223
406	now that is more than a five o'clock shadow	N	00:25:09.086
407	it 's a myth that hair grows after death	N	00:25:11.847
408	what happens is the skin contracts revealing whiskers	N	00:25:15.181
409	contraction of the erector pilae muscles combined with fixed lividity indicates time of death was at least two days ago	N	00:25:20.043
410	so she died before wendy	N	00:25:24.104
411	yeah sad as this is it presents as accidental	N	00:25:26.300
412	loss of blood due to hemorrhaging	N	00:25:28.454
413	pelvic artery was severed	N	00:25:30.228

597	i mean this day means so much to me	N	00:37:33.824
598	and to have girlfriends like you it 's just amazing	N	00:37:33.865
599	thirty seconds of mutilation recorded over a bridal shower	N	00:37:35.764
600	she told her best friend and officer mann that she had some videos to show	N	00:37:39.985
601	i think she must have been trying to expose lavalle	N	00:37:45.164
602	brown	N	00:37:52.683
603	really	N	00:37:54.682
604	thanks	N	00:37:56.762
605	that was brass	N	00:37:58.763
606	ten soccer moms confirm they saw dr lavalle and amberhamshaw at the soccer game the night wendy was killed	N	00:38:02.865
607	another dead end	N	00:38:06.985
608	those fingerprints on the video tape you recovered	N	00:38:08.874
609	we got a match	N	00:38:10.529
610	wendy 's video tape your fingerprint	Y	00:38:13.863
611	doctor help me understand something	Y	00:38:18.047
612	wendy videotaped the storage area threatening to expose your wife 's good work because your wife was threatening to tell wendy 's fiancee that she 's not what she appears to be	Y	00:38:24.923
613	but the three of you were still getting it on	Y	00:38:34.266
614	i beg your pardon	Y	00:38:35.984
615	based on the dna that we found in wendy 's cheek you were swapping spit with her and your wife was swapping something else with her	Y	00:38:41.702
616	now we know that post-ops ca n't ejaculate	N	00:38:47.664
617	so the only way i can explain the semen in wendy 's mouth is your wife is still packing	Y	00:38:51.185
618	yes and i performed fellatio on my wife after lunch	Y	00:38:54.841
619	is that a crime	N	00:38:58.045
620	i have no idea how anything got into wendy 's mouth	Y	00:38:59.883
621	my wife and i did not cheat	Y	00:39:03.566
622	you do n't get it do you	N	00:39:07.095
623	because we 're different	Y	00:39:08.631
624	we still love	Y	00:39:11.714
625	we still honor	Y	00:39:13.608
626	is that why you hacked out wendy 's adam 's apple	Y	00:39:15.964
627	love and honor	N	00:39:18.438
628	you went back to the storage area to get rid of vern 's body	Y	00:39:20.634
629	you saw wendy leaving	Y	00:39:22.210
630	mimosa look it 's me	N	00:39:38.570
631	i need your help okay	N	00:39:40.784
632	i have these videos and i have to show you them	N	00:39:43.225
633	you 're never going to believe what 's on them	N	00:39:45.181
634	these people they have to be stopped	Y	00:39:47.322
635	how dare you	N	00:39:52.904
636	you do n't appreciate anything she does for you	N	00:39:56.581
637	i tried to protect my wife 's work	Y	00:40:08.784
638	not just for us	Y	00:40:11.786
639	for all the people like us	Y	00:40:13.504
640	so the man admits to murder but not infidelity	Y	00:40:18.025
641	well maybe he was n't unfaithful	Y	00:40:20.061
642	you know i read a paper in the jfs documenting a case where a woman kissed a man who had smoked a cigarette	N	00:40:23.886
643	when they tested the cigarette butt they found both their dna on it	N	00:40:28.205
644	so you 're saying it was transfer	N	00:40:30.962
645	well if francis gave his wife fellatio shortly before he killed wendy it 's possible that some of the semen was still in his mouth and it got transferred onto her through his spit	Y	00:40:36.203
646	right	N	00:40:45.716
647	do n't you think	N	00:40:46.734
648	i thought you 'd want to know what happened to wendy	N	00:40:50.605
649	i appreciate your telling me	N	00:40:53.544
650	killed by someone in our own community	Y	00:40:56.206
651	as if we do n't have enough enemies	N	00:40:58.846
652	her parents never understood her but still i think they should know	N	00:41:06.242
653	what do i say	N	00:41:10.985
654	show them an oyster	N	00:41:15.975
655	i 'm sorry	N	00:41:17.351
656	there are two types of male oysters and one of them can change genders at will	N	00:41:21.244
657	and before man crawled out of the muck maybe he had the same option	N	00:41:26.324
