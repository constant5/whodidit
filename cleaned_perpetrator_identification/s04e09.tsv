364	i know i keep coming back to this but uh	N	00:33:20.607
365	i mean i got to ask you	N	00:33:22.541
366	what 's with the empty apartment	N	00:33:24.454
367	do you have a girlfriend on the side as well	N	00:33:26.575
368	no	N	00:33:28.354
369	just tell them the truth	N	00:33:31.914
370	my life is really a balancing act	N	00:33:34.410
371	early on i took debbie to dinner and beth saw it on a credit card statement	Y	00:33:43.434
372	so instead of a p.o	N	00:33:47.676
373	box i figured why not rent a cheap apartment you know	N	00:33:49.832
374	have a night to myself once in a while	N	00:33:53.279
375	we found a band-aid with your daughter amy 's blood at your apartment	N	00:33:57.135
376	so you bring your daughter there but not your wives	Y	00:34:00.527
377	oh no	N	00:34:02.142
378	it 's not like that	N	00:34:04.354
379	you know how kids are	N	00:34:06.989
380	dad take this	N	00:34:08.877
381	it keeps falling off	N	00:34:09.992
382	i emptied my pockets at the apartment	N	00:34:15.694
383	mr dunbar we collected both of your children 's volcanoes and supplies	N	00:34:19.034
384	and we found a pair of pliers at your home in henderson	N	00:34:23.954
385	those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes	N	00:34:27.765
386	that 's right	N	00:34:29.535
387	i needed pliers in henderson so i borrowed beth 's pliers from mesquite	Y	00:34:33.029
388	there 's no crime in that	N	00:34:36.434
389	i 'm just really confused	N	00:34:38.354
390	um your wife beth told us that you could n't build a volcano to save your soul	Y	00:34:42.934
391	yet your wife debbie claims that it was all you that made your daughter 's volcano	N	00:34:48.454
392	so what is it	N	00:34:51.374
393	well i watched beth when she made timmy 's volcano	Y	00:34:54.054
394	so then when amy had a science project i knew the drill	N	00:34:57.914
395	now granted it was n't as symmetrical as beth 's and the lava flow was a little anemic but amy liked it	Y	00:35:03.874
396	when did you borrow those pliers	N	00:35:08.755
397	i do n't know	N	00:35:10.451
398	couple weeks ago	N	00:35:11.754
399	why	N	00:35:13.057
400	you never returned them to your wife beth	Y	00:35:15.134
401	i 've been meaning to do that	N	00:35:19.594
402	same characteristics	N	00:35:26.676
403	we got a match	N	00:35:27.712
404	take her in	Y	00:35:31.485
405	come with me mrs dunbar	Y	00:35:37.935
406	we found these pliers in your car 's glove box	Y	00:38:13.536
407	you used them to fix the hose bib	Y	00:38:14.839
408	and to make a bomb	N	00:38:18.154
409	mrs dunbar how long have you known about roger 's double life	Y	00:38:25.755
410	his other wife 's name is debbie	N	00:38:30.255
411	once or twice a year he 'd call me by that name	Y	00:38:33.590
412	i ignored it	Y	00:38:35.914
413	it 's very difficult for two people to live a lie let alone three	N	00:38:38.834
414	look when roger and i were together he was a good husband	Y	00:38:42.664
415	terrific father	N	00:38:46.217
416	it was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon	N	00:38:49.231
417	really	N	00:38:51.834
418	so what changed	N	00:38:53.775
419	he asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car	Y	00:38:58.970
420	there was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano	N	00:39:04.304
421	including the stars i had hand-cut for my son	Y	00:39:06.394
422	i 'd always suspected there was another woman but never	Y	00:39:13.737
423	another family	N	00:39:16.652
424	so	N	00:39:20.557
425	two weeks ago sunday i followed him	Y	00:39:22.872
426	he uh dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building	N	00:39:27.354
427	then he changed his clothes and got into a nicer car and drove out to henderson	N	00:39:32.674
428	why did n't you just leave him	Y	00:39:37.747
429	turn him in	N	00:39:39.241
430	he made a fool out of me	Y	00:39:42.817
431	a mockery of our life	Y	00:39:44.851
432	mrs dunbar you killed three innocent people	Y	00:39:48.015
433	that was never my intention	Y	00:39:50.235
434	that bomb was supposed to go off at 8:30 on his way to the airport	N	00:39:55.734
435	why a bomb	N	00:40:00.755
