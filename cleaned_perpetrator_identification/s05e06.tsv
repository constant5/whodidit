331	you know what it 's like to be told you lead the life and fit the profile of a serial killer	N	00:23:23.842
332	no	N	00:23:26.825
333	i would n't have a clue	N	00:23:27.822
334	you see you make all these assumptions and you 're not asking questions here	N	00:23:28.819

363	anything from the prints off the van	N	00:25:02.162
364	prints from the dash and the rearview mirror were a match to the partial that we got off the trash bag debbyreston was found in two years ago	N	00:25:07.003
365	same guy but still no hits from afis	N	00:25:12.001
366	are the x-rated comic books ready	N	00:25:17.426
367	nothing comical about them	N	00:25:18.905
368	look at this	N	00:25:20.384
369	double-d cups tiny waists bondage	N	00:25:22.666
370	dehumanization	N	00:25:25.425
371	i 'm all for visual stimulation but these images are about domination not sex	N	00:25:30.202
372	this artist gets off on dominating women	Y	00:25:36.215
373	this is his sex	N	00:25:38.712
374	janet and marcia both lived in dakin hall	N	00:25:45.223

378	janet dated codylewis	N	00:25:58.905
379	kaitlin took his art class	N	00:26:00.861
380	all right so uh there 's not one single thing that all five women have in common	N	00:26:04.066
381	right	N	00:26:06.884
382	dead plates	N	00:27:16.114
383	tampered vin registration stickers are counterfeit	N	00:27:17.928
384	the killer did a good job though	Y	00:27:19.755
385	he used the right color changed them every year but no serial numbers	Y	00:27:21.251
386	so we still do n't know who owns the van	N	00:27:23.845
387	well greg did find this in the glove box	N	00:27:26.614
388	it 's from 1986	N	00:27:28.468
389	so i called school administration	N	00:27:30.465
390	it 's parking spot 324	N	00:27:32.556
391	not a student but an employee executed two years ago	N	00:27:34.615
392	johnmathers	N	00:27:37.303
393	yep	N	00:27:39.778
394	ran mathers through the dmv	N	00:27:41.401
395	the partial vin number on our van 's a match	N	00:27:43.024
396	so our killer was driving around in mathers old van	Y	00:27:45.423
397	i do n't think these two guys are an original and a copycat	Y	00:27:48.861
398	they were partners	Y	00:27:53.566
399	i do n't deserve to die	N	00:27:59.386
400	you think killing me will solve anything	N	00:28:01.986
401	i 've prepared myself but i 'm not ready	N	00:28:04.704
402	this the johnmathers interview	N	00:28:07.218
403	week before he was executed	N	00:28:10.222
404	charleneroth 's mother testified at the allocution that your death would mean her closure	N	00:28:14.225
405	not if you kill the wrong man	N	00:28:17.602
406	forensic evidence testified to at your trial says that you 're guilty	N	00:28:20.126
407	forensic evidence changes all the time	N	00:28:22.486
408	one day i 'm innocent the next day i 'm not	N	00:28:24.084
409	is there anything in his prison file	N	00:28:26.002
410	all those years on death row he only had one visitor his lawyer	N	00:28:28.845
411	although he did receive a far amount of letters from random women if he was in communication with his partner nothing in the file shows it	N	00:28:34.344
412	you 've been in prison for fifteen years	N	00:28:39.364
413	during that time the murders stopped	N	00:28:41.838
414	what does that prove	N	00:28:44.242
415	the real killer 's smart	Y	00:28:49.285
416	watches the news he reads the papers just like you	Y	00:28:52.299
417	i 'm man i 'm the perfect patsy	N	00:28:53.322
418	so you maintain your innocence	N	00:28:55.044
419	absolutely	N	00:28:56.159
420	i worked campus security	N	00:28:57.746
421	i 'm not the smartest or the richest guy but do i look like i had problems with women	N	00:29:00.985
422	i 'm not the killer	N	00:29:06.505
423	remember that when i 'm gone	N	00:29:10.744
424	well the prints on the comb bindings from the comic books are a match to the prints recovered from the van and the garbagebag that debbyreston was in	N	00:29:15.504
425	did you analyze the comics	N	00:29:20.144
426	yeah and the drawings indicate a dominant disassociative sexual sadist	N	00:29:25.421
427	prison shrink diagnosed mathers as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder	N	00:29:29.824
428	which means he was pre-disposed to violent crimes but he might have needed some encouragement	N	00:29:34.124
429	well to invite someone to join you for torture and murder would require a great deal of trust	N	00:29:38.242
430	you would only do it if you knew you could completely control your partner	N	00:29:42.325
431	mathers was the submissive	N	00:29:45.236
432	his partner is the alpha male	Y	00:29:47.295
433	sexual sadism can go hand in hand with sexual dysfunction	N	00:29:50.341
434	mathers said that he was n't the killer but we confirmed that he had sex with charleneroth based on the fact that we found his pubic hairs on her body	N	00:29:55.705
435	mia was looking for saliva on the beer bottles from the van and found a vaginal contribution on the neck of one of them	N	00:30:01.682
436	maybe mathers was this guy 's surrogate pen1s	N	00:30:05.806
437	question	N	00:30:10.265
438	the partner kills on the eve of mathers execution and again this week on the second anniversary	Y	00:30:14.381
439	why the no-show last year	N	00:30:18.635
440	maybe life got in the way	N	00:30:20.131
